[0:58:16] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Will they make it more account friendly?
[0:58:43] betweenlions: FFXIV does that with their relic/ultimate weapons towards the end of their expansions, they are a bit of a grind tho
[0:58:52] Chubbspeterson: @jmalmin you must not play wow. If you could have 4 trinkets some classes would be insanely unstable

[1:02:54] Todmeister9000: I can't evene imagine 1.1 billion
[1:02:57] 91Niki: We all know where that wow gold comes from Kappa
[1:03:01] Gozzy: SK said they hadn't even gone into debt with what they spent too.
[1:03:11] Aidler: it‚Äôs chinese gold‚Ä¶
[1:03:32] jamarky23: @jamarky23 Well the easier fix for that, would be making progression account wide instead
[1:03:47] Kisswani: yeah , but they dont buy tokens to fund it
[1:03:48] nephttv_: Neph__98 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months!

[1:04:30] nephttv_: not much man, grinding keys like usual
[1:04:53] Doog45: i thought you were supposed to be able covenant swap easily in 9.2 if you had a toon that had reached 80 on that account?  You can swap but it doesn't unlock on the conduit slots
[1:05:05] pereadin: EZKEY
[1:05:10] Mheerkat: i wish wow had account wide reputations so i could change my main :(

[1:05:43] KutzTV: @jamarky23 I'd prefer being able to play old/other content for the sake of the content, than because I need to level another character which I may or may not enjoy playing in the end. But for sure, I'm no dev. I just want things like everyone else :p
[1:06:26] ventu105: ESO is a good MMO guys I'm watching reviews on YouTube it looks good.
[1:06:52] Phantomstrk: one char to 80 renown, alts can free switch, and you can buy a renown boost to level 40 from the vendor next to the FP in Oribos
[1:06:55] xhaven: ESO is great but its quite different from wow
[1:07:05] Doog45: yea you can, but it doesn't unlock all the conduit slots, you still need to farm some renown, cuz you only start out at renown level 40

[1:08:16] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  echo said that they spent around 350m gold
[1:08:31] Alegnowar: crazy numbers, i wonder if blizz is concerned by that
[1:08:31] 91Niki: 32k is more than I make a year KEKW

[1:08:58] Doog45: don't they get two resets per week?
[1:09:32] Kisswani: No , it's debt
[1:09:41] faulen: debt

[1:10:16] Calphurnious: @ventu105 It's a little thing but I really like lock picking the chest in that game
[1:10:29] Kisswani: yeah , just to put it in context . Max said they'll be laughed at if they asked their sponsors for RL money to buy tokens @Towelliee KEKW
[1:10:30] itsjustsarge: I don't think they are really. If you look at the price of runs + how many boosties per run. The guilds are making easily 50-60 million gold per run for boosts. Granted some of it gets split between raiders and whatnot
[1:10:36] Alegnowar: i hope 10.0 will have global raid release so we can have even better competition across all regions
[1:10:36] ventu105: cool

[1:13:28] Oceansevan: not to mention NA gets the fun job of smashing their heads on a bugged boss for 4-8 hours, then it gets fixed and EU gets the kill
[1:13:29] FrankTizzle: also higher tier guilds have more alts to adjust their strats with
[1:13:31] Shrenko: yeah I guess that works @91Niki cohhLUL
[1:13:34] ventu105: in WoW I'm a Survival hunter

[1:15:06] wreaveit: wouldnt global release be bad for the raiders since eu has to get up at midnight at start and have a fucked up sleep schedule for 2+ weeks?
[1:15:10] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee  I logged out and went to another character a little while.  Logged back over was in a new shard and was able to complete.  this was yesterday

[1:15:54] Alegnowar: i mean Eu guild can start at midnight for the first day then go to normal schedule the days after
[1:16:05] Gozzy: global release just means some regions will start asleep whereas some will sleep in teh first day of raid
[1:16:11] nephttv_: I pay monthy for this game to be upset obviously

[1:17:05] Gozzy: think of every 'race' people have on a game that has a global release. it never really matters.
[1:17:08] kharditv: HAAAAX

[1:18:30] Kisswani: I just want blizzard to announce global release and then have an extended maintainance in one region Kappa
[1:18:32] maalow: global release is good but doesn't solve the weekly reset issue
[1:18:34] fred_birkhoff: it's from when you do that blood elf quest in undercity
[1:18:37] FrankTizzle: That's why I think it will NEVER happen
[1:18:45] boopbopbamski: blizzards PR leak with dragonflight reminds me of the PR will smith smack
[1:18:48] mavericks312: that's a 10 hr maintenence lol

[1:19:37] FlySkeez: was there new content added to WoW?
[1:19:37] mavericks312: it would be a huge cluster fuck
[1:19:44] 91Niki: It would be full REEEEEEEEE mode LUL
[1:19:55] pereadin: @Towelliee do you think RWF should be based on time to kill and not date of kill?
[1:19:58] Kisswani: Morgan said that about tier acquisition
[1:20:00] 91Niki: @stallowned sacPAT
[1:20:05] faulen: They would have to do it like expansion launch. Have the files in game and just have it enabled at a certain time. Then for maintance, take down the servers for 24 hours.
[1:20:11] Rudric_Ice: so dragonflight expansion legit ?
[1:20:21] stallowned: hey niki towHi
[1:20:34] mavericks312: we blame them for everything else already anyway lol
[1:20:36] pereadin: Just playing the part of devil's advocate :D
[1:20:39] Aquadriel: yeah fuck your global release imo, if top guilds want a 'fair' start, they should communicate and organize themselves for it and not depend on blizzard
[1:21:01] xFevers: Thats every race lol
[1:21:05] Alegnowar: blizz is lucky that we haven't yet got a race decided by an early NA reset time

[1:22:32] nephttv_: idk what it is with EU, its the same thing in League. EU players constantly shit talk NA but cry if they lose to NA @Towelliee

[1:25:36] faulen: Nnoggie apps he built alone, are insane.
[1:25:37] mavericks312: @peanutbeards echo is essentially method still lol
[1:25:52] Peanutbeards: ^^

[1:26:05] LesterLinton: hehe
[1:26:07] raymond3195: liquid too much in to joking around not enough focus
[1:26:11] mavrikbtw: @jmalmin right
[1:26:12] Gingerprimer: TBH both teams had insane strats on Rygelon and played liked gods on that fight
[1:26:13] faulen: Have you seen that replay app that Nnoggie built? @Towelliee
[1:26:15] mmo_kenna_: liquid best guild in the world, echo hold my beer
[1:26:16] Phantomstrk: if RWF was "time to kill" based, there would be no streams, why would you stream your strats at that point as that would definitely cause you to lose
[1:26:18] Mystic_Bard: tbh I would love to see some NA guilds raid without been worried with their leave time been very limited compared to europe
[1:26:20] mavrikbtw: @raymond3195 facts
[1:26:36] boopbopbamski: ya bad take that has nothing to do with it
[1:26:38] Zeke_nl: yeah thats how they raid, they play well when they are having fun
[1:26:40] 91Niki: That's BS. Joking means they are relaxed.
[1:26:41] xFevers: TRUE
[1:26:42] mavericks312: liquid plays there best when there joking and having fun
[1:26:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, some joking around breaks the tension and helps with stress
[1:26:46] Gingerprimer: Yeah shit take
[1:26:49] boopbopbamski: also the joking and having fun helps the vibe
[1:27:00] mmo_kenna_: that's how liquid raid to ease tension
[1:27:00] Alegnowar: this time around i buzzed a bit on thd stream and it seemed a bit excessive
[1:27:05] Doog45: i think Liquid was just at the complex for too long and got burned out.
[1:27:12] boopbopbamski: ya EU is just much more serious gamers the vibe is just different
[1:27:12] AssassinKhal: heaven forbid they have fun
[1:27:20] Dark_Kornax: if you aren't having fun, why are you doing it?
[1:27:25] boopbopbamski: but i do see how ppl could look at liquid and think it could be a problem but its not
[1:27:31] thunder993: Their attitude on Rygalon and Lords was terrible imo, Echo took the lead there
[1:27:31] faulen: Have you seen that replay app that Nnoggie built? @Towelliee
[1:27:33] 91Niki: Being serious, quiet and not being able to fool around is just gonna burn out more people a lot faster. A more loose take helps people stay focused when needed
[1:27:39] mavericks312: liquid was at there location for almost a month mentally they checked out at the end
[1:27:47] Otton_03: Joking means they're comfortable, if they're comfortable ina fight, it means it's going well. Simple.
[1:27:50] Sebell777: For me the biggest dif is between scipe and max. Scipe is to good 5Head

[1:28:23] AssassinKhal: if they stayed dead pan and serious that whole time, they wouldnt have gone as far, imo. thats just how liquid does it
[1:28:30] Mystic_Bard: also EU guilds have ppl from different countires, not the same humor for a Finish or German with a south european
[1:28:31] vikaelzidek: whats coming in 15 days?

[1:28:45] Phantomstrk: that location was basically "some companies creepy storage warehouse"
[1:28:50] mavericks312: I believe in the future heroic week they stay home
[1:28:53] Kisswani: monkaS
[1:28:54] Jomuse92: To be able to joke around like that and still be remotely close to wf like that is incredible on it's own
[1:28:54] Sayryn: LOL full of floor pissers and bowl shitters
[1:28:55] stallowned: monkaS
[1:28:57] vikaelzidek: nice
[1:28:57] faulen: what do you mean??!?!? they had a limo and red carpets Kappa
[1:29:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: In 15 days, Blizzard rocks the world!
[1:29:00] 91Niki: The end of the world as we know it pepeMeltdown
[1:29:02] r0b928: At their level their rotation is second nature. Almost reflex like, they dont need to focus that hard to be perfect at it.
[1:29:04] Zeke_nl: meanwhile raiders in liquid needed to get back to work so you know that was stressful for them
[1:29:08] Jomuse92: AND THE DOVAKHIN WILL ANSWER
[1:29:11] Clicklesly: I remember the first day there and Max or THD saying how they're all on single monitors and they're getting dual next day only ^^
[1:29:11] Baneleaf: THe location they were supposed to be at was not going to be ready for another few weeks. They said that the next RWF they will be in the actual Liquid facility
[1:29:23] Rudric_Ice: can we have robot dragons ?
[1:29:23] Aquadriel: its wow
[1:29:30] Kisswani: I hope Galakrond is the next big villian
[1:29:32] hnti86: why not both Kappa ?
[1:29:32] r0b928: Cata 2.0?
[1:29:33] Baneleaf: Its not add ons Towlie, it is doing that to everyone with the chest.
[1:29:36] GngrWoW: The add on is a bit flaky, my firend. Mine does the same.
[1:29:36] thunder993: sometimes it disappeares if you get too close
[1:29:37] Gingerprimer: They were supposed to be at the renovated Alienware facility in LA but permits got delayed so the the facility was not up and running at the time of the race
[1:29:40] Peanutbeards: Just go there anyways. The chest will be there. It glitches a lot.
[1:29:41] mavericks312: well the alienware facility is in LA correct?
[1:29:47] Synonymous: we gon soulbind with dragon souls Pog
[1:29:48] magemaster225: you could try curseforge, there was big addon updater drama the past couple months
[1:29:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not saying that Jaina will be Mother of Dragons, but she could be
[1:29:49] xFevers: Most people watch Echo because they are amazing, while most people love liquid because of the vibe
[1:29:53] nephttv_: @Towelliee You going back dwarf with me when we can?
[1:29:55] Gurtogg: it disappears from minimap when someone loots it no?
[1:29:59] onybear: Sometimes if you fly too high or to low they disappear from the map
[1:30:05] eyemyor: Gonna hop on that Limit tip again :P

[1:31:11] Rudric_Ice: if they lose the 10.0 launch raid too liquid might just disband
[1:31:15] fistofnature: i like to play both, but id never leave horde LUL
[1:31:16] thunder993: I wonder how will they expand cross faction stuff in future
[1:31:17] Baneleaf: I made the mistake of going LIght Forged on my paladin becuase I did not have one on my account, but as soon as the services go on sale again I am going back to dwarf
[1:31:33] Jomuse92: @Rudric_Ice nah man
[1:31:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna have to take THD for a ride  in the mach e
[1:31:58] pereadin: theyre like Cloud9
[1:32:17] xFevers: They make so much money even if they dont win... lol 1Head take
[1:32:24] mavericks312: you would see a massive rehaul of the raid team for sure
[1:32:27] Gingerprimer: Yeah Max is also under contract for a long time he said so on stream
[1:32:31] thunder993: They make insane money even in loses
[1:32:32] JonLW: Liquipedia was early internet info too. remember reading SC2 strats on there
[1:32:33] scridderz: It‚Äôd be awesome to listen to you commenting the next RWF.  Your voice is perfect for it, could listen to it for hours without even watching.
[1:32:38] Amarlian: They might also like doing it, sure they want to win, but they might have fun just pushing
[1:32:42] Xsilentghost: 3 losses in a row is rough
[1:32:54] Sebell777: I wonder how long liquid is gonna be happy if wow guild will underperfom
[1:33:00] Gurtogg: max showed a chart on stream and it showed that Echo had alot more views
[1:33:01] RocketMan23: *cough* cowboys *cough*
[1:33:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: they still made money, its not like they lost prize money for not being 1st
[1:33:03] Stormrazer78: wow 10 dragons???
[1:33:04] zigzugg: just look at the lakers KEKW
[1:33:06] Kisswani: *Laughs in NY Knicks *
[1:33:15] mavericks312: look at the lakers this year
[1:33:17] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  in all pro sports lol
[1:33:20] Jomuse92: Oh man the goddamn cowboys. You are preachin
[1:33:20] mavrikbtw: true
[1:33:23] Amarlian: Oh so if they don't win the superbowl next year, they are doing to disband?
[1:33:25] Fafnyir: Toronto Maple Leafs! Nuff Said...
[1:33:34] akia03: was the 90s with troy aikman withthe cowboys
[1:33:34] Zeke_nl: echo was ahead by like one million views but max viewship was really high
[1:33:35] EscapePlan01: yeh there's no cash prize for rtwf is there? sorry, been out of the loop on it, but surely revenue is what matters
[1:33:36] Sebell777: @Towelliee Ye and about views, max showed that echo had more people watching on twitch overall
[1:33:42] Zeke_nl: @Fafnyir LUL
[1:33:51] Ezekyler: pay to win Kappa
[1:34:04] Gingerprimer: @EscapePlan01 yeah it is alll about vierwership and sponsors
[1:34:06] mavericks312: you gotta Yankee that shit and buy wins
[1:34:12] Peanutbeards: They havn't poached me yet. Oh yea because I suck azz Kappa
[1:34:16] Pallananana: But gaming with the boys is life D:
[1:34:17] thunder993: latices you can
[1:34:17] rohdey: the lettice you can
[1:34:20] Clicklesly: Lattices are on AH at least ^^
[1:34:21] r0b928: I would like to see these viewership stats you‚Äôre looking at.
[1:34:24] brandypopss: if you play an alt, do you have to do all zereth mortis campaign quests again, if you have already done it on your main?
[1:34:35] dimofodi: If some of this stuff is on AH...GG
[1:34:41] Alegnowar: no u need to farm the genesis and the special item, lattices are on the AH
[1:34:42] Baneleaf: You can buy most of them. THere are a few that are raid drops/special drops.
[1:34:44] Gingerprimer: @brandypopss no not really
[1:34:45] Sebell777: @r0b928 go to max vod its there
[1:35:01] LesterLinton: yes all again to unlock the legend belt
[1:35:02] Amarlian: You can skip quests 1-3
[1:35:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't think any of the mount or pet mats can be sold on the AH
[1:35:11] thunder993: you can skip to 3
[1:35:13] mavericks312: yes
[1:35:13] xFevers: @Sebell777 The echo channel did but liquid has more total view accross all channels. Plus echo teamed up with BDGG
[1:35:15] r0b928: Echo was always ahead of liquid in viewers when I checked.
[1:35:20] dimofodi: Bind on Account, Wowhead will tell you where most are
[1:35:22] GngrWoW: list on wowhead
[1:35:22] rohdey: drops/chests
[1:35:23] zigzugg: the lattices you can buy from the ah
[1:35:24] neverbeenhip: randomly in zm
[1:35:28] neverbeenhip: theyre out and about
[1:35:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: If you can sell them on the AH, I need sell those...I have a ton
[1:35:33] thunder993: drop from specific mobs/chest
[1:35:34] neverbeenhip: can find them laying around
[1:35:39] micha3lsc0tt: Rates @towelliee
[1:35:41] chirsen: hey @Towelliee you hyped for the dragons?
[1:35:41] rohdey: @Towelliee you can go around and pick up a bunch of the schematics in ZM
[1:35:45] Alegnowar: they drop from specific places, the win'd call are from the big birds in zereth mortis for example
[1:35:46] micha3lsc0tt: Rares
[1:35:50] mavericks312: echos numbers this race loaded because they hosted bdgg at night
[1:35:58] TrixStar36: @r0b928 thats because the people watching Liquid were watching Max lol
[1:36:13] Amarlian: @brandypopss You can skip 1-3, you will get the rep you would have gotten but miss out on the quest items. Any cypher research doesn't carry over but it turns into instant research.
[1:36:29] Rottencoarse: to me echo's casters for this race were better than liquid's
[1:36:33] JediNeo99999: I also enjoyed Echo casters during the actual raiding a lot more
[1:36:35] r0b928: @trixstar36 ah ok. I don‚Äôt follow his channel. Just echo and limit channel
[1:36:35] Baneleaf: @r0b928 if you combine Max and Liquid stream they were way ahead of Echo and their individual streamers. THe issue was that most people were not following Liquid on twitch at the beginning but they were following Max so they started to cross over as the race went on.
[1:36:43] Kisswani: 12 th ?
[1:36:48] Rottencoarse: don't get me wrong  i like naguura and the others but
[1:36:55] Lupine_Fury: @Towelliee paladins ineffective this tier for raiding?
[1:37:06] DaKevin10: What kinda preorder rewards you think we are getting?
[1:37:13] mavericks312: had to be february

[1:37:46] r0b928: @baneleaf I gotcha.  I never even tuned in to max‚Äôs stream or saw it, I just compared echo and liquid streams.
[1:37:50] stoop_kid69: when can we create tier?
[1:38:07] JediNeo99999: April 12th
[1:38:10] Doog45: @ThatCashmoney 4/12
[1:38:26] stoop_kid69: ty
[1:38:44] Armdel: liquidgaming i think
[1:38:47] r0b928: I thought for sure liquid was gunna win on that third reset Tuesday when they could get double legendaries.

[1:39:51] MrGharr: echo channel was way more entertaining
[1:39:56] CapTV8: Echo channel also had Preach, he contributed a ton of viewers

[1:40:06] MrGharr: better cast, better room
[1:40:10] eyemyor: The Liquid main channel was awful, Max's stream was much better
[1:40:14] Gurtogg: echo had more total watched hours
[1:40:17] erish: @Towelliee ofc people looking at Max/liquid more cause they are allways pulling the new bosses first (not the last ones)
[1:40:20] SicDogg: whats the question mark for ???
[1:40:25] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  the echo peaks were during when preach was casting mostly
[1:40:31] Rottencoarse: preach himself said it today
[1:40:33] Sebell777: I would say is really good for ORG than echo channel was much more entertaining than private max stream
[1:40:36] Fieldbaker: @Towelliee Just did p1 argos, how is p2 and p3? Hard?
[1:40:39] IzacCS: just check Max youtube Post race Q&A he starts with viewership

[1:40:46] Otton_03: Limit starting earlier means you get to see the boss first there, why watch echo for the first couple of bosses ?
[1:40:49] xFevers: @Gurtogg The main channel, yes. They also Streamed 24/67 with BDGG
[1:41:05] SicDogg: @HaxzorJimDuggan ty
[1:41:09] halfchubstrangler: limit comms are more entertaining than echo
[1:41:10] Zeke_nl: im sure this next race will be a lot different, probably a year away, rosters will change for sure
[1:41:12] mavericks312: echo also streamed bdgg when they weren't raiding
[1:41:12] Phantomstrk: yeah, max has said he may not stream next tier cause he want's it to go to main channel, and main channel can "switch to" each players POV
[1:41:15] halfchubstrangler: prolly helps max's channel
[1:41:20] CapTV8: Max also said he shared 70% of his channel revenue with the rest of the team
[1:41:43] xFevers: Boooo, comms are so much better than casters
[1:41:54] cazhually: @CapTV8 any idea how much that actually equalds
[1:41:55] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah just like echo/method did

[1:42:11] faulen: He splits it with liquid and the team, doesn't he?
[1:42:11] eyemyor: Liquid comms were more entertaining, Echo casters were better.
[1:42:35] xFevers: imo main channel is for people who dont understand the game
[1:42:54] Rudric_Ice: liquid casters suck. Echo casters were fun to watch
[1:42:58] Novaht: NovaHeadTurner subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 13 month streak! Wassup wassup @towelliee
[1:42:59] CapTV8: @cazhually he said he received 19,000 subs during the race so figure $3 per sub as a Twitch Partner
[1:42:59] falldrgn: how much is alot of money tho?
[1:43:01] Otton_03: It's for sponsors, as they sponsor the main channel mostly
[1:43:13] akia03: and also less hassle with toxic watchers in your own stream
[1:43:16] eyemyor: Echo casters gained a lot of fans this race, especially Okaymage
[1:43:44] falldrgn: @CapTV8 works out to be abour 2K a person once its broken down'
[1:43:46] Sayryn: I will always watch players over the main channel. I don't want to hear analysts
[1:43:50] Malitor: morning hammer fam
[1:43:56] MrGharr: yea basicly liquid stream was awful. max stream was a lot better. But echo was way better.
[1:44:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: sponsors dont care about your personal channel either
[1:44:20] Doog45: @Sayryn same, talking for the sake of talking is annoying
[1:44:20] Kinghorn: big same Sayryn
[1:44:22] Armdel: Im the same way, i prefer to just hear the player voice chat
[1:44:24] faulen: I like the analysts too

[1:44:30] ollievoll: Hearing player coms is better than listening to analysts
[1:44:31] WoW_StandalonE: Preach carried Echo channel like a boss
[1:44:40] dimofodi: @Towelliee the only one who should give up their own channel is Max. He's the only one who has a stake in Liquid and is basically secure in the fold. Even THD could no longer be with Liquid next tier. Why make that sacrifice?
[1:44:44] Rottencoarse: @WoW_StandalonE  that he did lol
[1:44:44] BelacKriv: I thought the Liquid production (overlays, player povs, etc) was a LOT better on liquid's side
[1:44:50] MrGharr: @WoW_StandalonE like fatboss?
[1:45:06] boopbopbamski: "give up his channel" waddduiuuu heck not gonna happen
[1:45:11] Doog45: can someone tell my man Dratnos, do something about that crazy body hair going everywhere
[1:45:14] obiwansc: I have to watch the analyst, watching the streamers make me anxious when it‚Äôs close to a kill
[1:45:23] faulen: he could get "benched" basically
[1:45:27] xFevers: Max has a streamer deal with liquid. All his channel revenue goes to liquid anyway
[1:45:29] Kisswani: Full chinese liquid guild POGGERS
[1:45:41] Asyia3: I watched liquids main channel and imfiredup. imfiredups channel was really good, comes and low toxic from people.
[1:45:43] Sebell777: @Doog45 Just man being man EZ
[1:46:01] eyemyor: Firedup was good
[1:46:06] cazhually: ftblubbler mentioned on twitter how players in liquid were playing greedy and not playing for the team
[1:46:11] JediNeo99999: Max said he doesn't want new people as much. He thinks that's one of Echo's strong points is they have a lot of experience and Liquid had a lot of first time racers
[1:46:18] Fieldbaker: @Towelliee do you see yourself playing lost ark for a long time?
[1:46:23] eyemyor: If I were liquid, I'd just be frightened of Lorgok's arms.
[1:46:24] Arendo26: i know everyone loves to watch the raid leader do his thing
[1:46:24] dimofodi: That's my point MAX is secure but no one else in Liquid is so why should they give it up not knowing how much it'll really hurt them in the next couple months/down the road?
[1:46:32] eyemyor: His arms alone could crush the world first race
[1:46:42] akia03: maybe they should just get 1 big room and get some good casters from around the world let them cast every guild and have guilds just stay home to race
[1:46:45] snake_like: yeah, I don't remember which of my alts has the cypher buff
[1:46:48] xFevers: FT is salty though. He was let go from Liquiid
[1:46:51] duffluv22: Good morning all!!!
[1:47:14] falldrgn: well.. having that org contract is good for THD.. and max sharing is always good. basic math was like 2K for that RWF in additon to whatever else he made.
[1:47:30] duffluv22: Steelers all the way!!!!
[1:47:31] Cristiex2012: @Towelliee Did blizzard ever finishi giving each race their heritage armor? Kinda quit wow at the start of 9.0
[1:47:34] faulen: FTBubler

[1:55:42] 91Niki: @jasperboy towHi
[1:55:42] nephttv_: the shield passive trinket looks good for m+ if you pair it with scale
[1:55:45] smashwow: sigil is a 5 min CD that lines up with nothing
[1:56:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: 5 min CD is totally boomer
[1:56:12] Dagomarus: I miss some trinkets from nathria i cant wait till season 4
[1:56:23] jasperboy: Sigil is 30% dmg for 20 sec on a 5 min CD. The CD is not that great but overall, its VERY good. Specially on pull with lust etc..

[1:56:46] Zeke_nl: lol man that guy ftbubbler was so mad. called out podra and atrocity
[1:56:47] Dagomarus: If i cant kill my raid members with the fire trinket from kael‚Äôthas i dont wanna raid Madge
[1:57:01] snake_like: hope they either bring back artifact weapons or add some kind or new relic slot for librams/poison vials
[1:57:08] smashwow: it's 30% assuming you haven't hit DR for vers

[1:57:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: I really think that all cooldowns should be adjusted to be 1 minute, 2 minute at the most
[1:57:47] Dagomarus: Yeah its a over a 1000 versatility for 20 seconds for a dk thats insane
[1:57:52] bigb0omer: wish all tanks knew to keep those together.. guess thats what ya get when ya pug all day
[1:58:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Demon Hunter early in Shadowlands showed how 1 minute cooldowns are just easier to use in M+
[1:58:27] Ryukotsu: i can't wait to farm Aspect Power Keepo

[2:00:28] Gingerprimer: Using LOS is weird in this place
[2:00:37] Dagomarus: My trinket drop rate in raid 1000% my trinket drop rate from dungeons  is 1%
[2:00:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shadowpriest's psyfiend has done crazy stuff for awhile
[2:00:43] Gingerprimer: I think most WW bugs are fixed

[2:02:43] Gingerprimer: @Dagomarus  Yeah it is a intended mechanic of the game
[2:02:56] smashwow: spitefuls use to despawn after 8 seconds. it feels like they messed with that timer or removed it

[2:06:44] Dagomarus: I dont understand why they are waiting that long its not like theirs anymore campaign quests to do

[3:00:13] SiXKiNG_: would be an epic misdirect if so
[3:00:19] DragonofWolves: I have on my bingo card, so evolution of the garrison aka player housing. I hope it happens.
[3:00:29] Dagomarus: Clearly 40% worth of murlocks before you into the bosses usually saves back tracking
[3:00:30] DragonofWolves: an evolution*
[3:00:48] Qargory: 50% in first area i believe
[3:00:53] nephttv_: that giant had some beef

[3:01:41] pereadin: 200 points POGG

[3:01:56] MammothGB: I'll be happy if it's not some other giant cosmic villain, just happy to enjoy Azeroth sometimes
[3:01:59] Dagomarus: Like what else could do we do, dragons make the most sense we aint seen them in a big roll since cata

[3:02:11] liviu_81: boots
[3:02:26] dimofodi: @Towelliee only negative I've seen is rumors it could have another covenant like system because of the multiple dragonflights etc.

[3:02:49] Restopieces: Codex only drops from streets
[3:02:49] Dagomarus: Disgustang
[3:02:54] 91Niki: Yes we do Sollice
[3:03:02] smashwow: basically 20% per lvl above 15+
[3:03:02] mmo_kenna_: hopefully the story telling is better in DF
[3:03:07] SpoofAvatar: new AP = Aspect Power, LUL
[3:03:19] Eregbueye: whats the chance for ?
[3:03:32] smashwow: i swear if we have a 4 xpac with AP i'm out
[3:03:40] Dagomarus: @gdmonger thats my guess or Dragon Force DF
[3:04:01] liviu_81: i m going to wait to see if there s any ap bs b4 i buy , i swear to god
[3:04:18] mmo_kenna_: wow story is like an over-dramtic bad soap opera. LostArks was better and they havnt got nowhere near the lore wow has
[3:04:19] smashwow: like at least call it something other than AP
[3:04:31] smashwow: like dragon friend power or something ffs

[3:05:04] annokev: If have a dragon exapac and not use a currency called DKP  its a waste!
[3:05:09] smashwow: the AP initials just make it feel like a fixation at this point
[3:05:35] ndras: not sure how i feel about dragons theme

[3:06:15] dankmeliodas: The dude behind the Azerite system is gone now so here is to hoping they change it up
[3:06:31] smashwow: dragons and fantasy go hand in hand. the question is not will dragon theme be bad. but will the systems be bloated and awful
[3:06:48] liviu_81: monkaHmm
[3:06:49] Dagomarus: I doubt the whole expansion will be about dragons, like bfa went into old gods and alliance war, i think we will dip our toes into multiple storylines
[3:07:12] mavericks312: aspect potency will be the new farm in dragonflight
[3:07:16] dankmeliodas: Pretty sure he was also the Dom sockets = tier sets guy
[3:07:38] smashwow: with dragons you get old gods and void, etc etc etc
[3:07:40] dankmeliodas: So one less shit designer on the team
[3:07:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it really depends on the systems and quality of life things, if Dragonflight is a banger
[3:08:11] NiteLancer: there's a new dragonlance series coming out this year too
[3:08:14] mavericks312: idk if they go full void lords next xpac maybe take 1 off of like cosmic baddies

[3:09:39] smashwow: @mavericks312 idk, Ion said in a post they'd like to return to a one cosmic focused xpac, then one azeroth focused. but in all honesty azeroth got thrown into the cosmic with legion then SL
[3:09:39] Moobot: Did you know this drop was designed in Photoshop? Students get the whole Adobe Creative suitefor just $19.99/month http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html
[3:09:44] Dagomarus: I think if we need to farm something it should be passive, like everything we do in the expansion gives us that thing like how we get anima now for everything from raiding to scratching our ass
[3:09:45] dankmeliodas: Pretty sure they are gonna lean into expanding established themes for Dragonflight since SL was a huge misstep
[3:10:14] dankmeliodas: Anima power was shit farm though
[3:10:14] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:10:34] smashwow: there's a lot of really cool things they can do with dragons. they just gotta not screw it up
[3:10:37] dankmeliodas: Didn‚Äôt get better till 2 major content patches in
[3:10:43] mavericks312: we need a setup xpac or a new story starts xpac
[3:10:52] Dagomarus: @danklobos that was because the rewards were bad, not neccessarily the process of getting it imo
[3:11:19] dankmeliodas: Rewards costed way too much for the time invested was the problem
[3:11:29] Nanoguts: thats peoples issue rn tbh is the NEW story you know? lmao
[3:11:37] Nanoguts: the new stories have been wack
[3:11:38] Todmeister9000: a new Dragon Jailer POG
[3:11:51] Nanoguts: I agree I just want good systems and gameplay
[3:11:58] snake_like: The Goolager
[3:11:59] Nanoguts: with a touch of nice wow lore
[3:12:02] Dagomarus: Aye now i have too much anima lol i literally switch covenants and stole 40k anima from revendreth and took it to necrolords lol
[3:12:20] tigress75422: way i see it, unless i see otherwise, 10.0 is just going to be another shitshow of an expansion
[3:12:21] Amarlian: I kind of liked the leveling story and how it flowed
[3:12:35] duffluv22: Galakrond flys like Deathwing and kills everyone...lol

[3:12:47] duffluv22: Stroy is everything
[3:12:58] Thoreya: ^ lol
[3:13:06] Thoreya: in wow it never was never will be
[3:13:11] smashwow: story is everything if you're reading a book or watching a movie
[3:13:12] paulwow777: KEKW
[3:13:12] Dagomarus: IMO all mmos need a grind, its just the grind needs to be fun
[3:13:21] smashwow: if you're playing a game you need good gameplay too
[3:13:21] reggiepowa: only gameplay matters for me in WoW
[3:13:21] Thoreya: wow wasnt at its peak bc of its story
[3:13:24] babadookz1251: Only here for the pet battles
[3:13:24] Nanoguts: its the gameplay narrative thats important now the "story"
[3:13:36] Nanoguts: not*
[3:13:38] Kisswani: Seeing WoW twitter , some lore people terrify me
[3:13:39] DragonofWolves: I unsubbed with 9.1 due to the story. Wanting to come back with 10.0 but I'll see how it is
[3:13:44] basedgubbs: ive played destiny all the way to max light and dont have a single clue as to what is going on in the story
[3:13:56] dimofodi: I don't care about story....I want to raid log, and raid on alts etc. That's all I like, keys give me freaking anxiety.
[3:13:59] Malitor: ehh, I like the story ;p
[3:14:14] duffluv22: So might as well just go straight to end boos expansion as long as the game play is good
[3:14:17] smashwow: like i care about the story. but i care more about good game play
[3:14:18] dankmeliodas: Warcraft 3 is what got me into the story and world of Warcraft
[3:14:22] duffluv22: boss
[3:14:22] Dagomarus: The loudest opinions will always be the negative people
[3:14:44] tigress75422: thing is the gameplay sucks as well
[3:14:45] thiccsushi: I never cared for the wow story the barrier to entry felt off compared to FF where I felt like being a part of the journey
[3:14:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: they will be back, they always come back
[3:14:48] dankmeliodas: Which is why I quit in 9.1 cause I didn‚Äôt care for SL story narrative
[3:14:48] Qargory: they're the people grasping lol
[3:14:49] Malitor: I mostly like the characters.. except the Jailer.. such a horrible baddie
[3:14:52] mavericks312: i am interested in how they do tier in 10.0
[3:15:05] Thoreya: ya game is fun rn from a gameplay perspective
[3:15:08] Kisswani: I think it's mostly because you experience the story once , but systems are gameplay are your everyday experience
[3:15:16] Dagomarus: No one goes full caps and insists to everyone they meet saying ‚Äú your all wrong, the game is amazing‚Äù only the Madge crowd does that shit lol
[3:15:22] mavericks312: i miss the class specific tier sets not the sofo sets
[3:15:25] Qargory: how do we even get there lol
[3:15:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: new ff14 story in a week
[3:15:39] powerpablo03: will u ever come back to classic?
[3:15:41] Nanoguts: I feel like its more about how the story is presented to you in a narrative design way with the gameplay. most people just find the story confusing more than hating it straight out
[3:15:41] DragonofWolves: I mean, i liked the SL story starting out BUUT it started to dwndle into nonsense so it just became uninteresting
[3:15:42] Qargory: does magne bring us back and go "CHAMPION, THE DRAGONS ARE FIGHTING"
[3:15:43] dankmeliodas: My issue is what they did to Warcraft 3 lore for the sake of trying to make the Jailer relevant
[3:15:46] mizerboy: I miss Titan/Warforge
[3:15:49] Nanoguts: the way its told in GAME is just really scattered
[3:15:54] SpencerHD: The people who only play for story though tend to not be people who sub for 6 months at a time. They tend to be seasonal players who sub for a couple months then unsub until something new comes out.
[3:16:02] snake_like: "Battle for Azeroth? I wanted a NZoth expansion" Kapp
[3:16:04] Horgoloth: the code on the site has been changed to something that's not even the same fonctionnality x)
[3:16:04] Serlindale: Serlindale subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[3:16:07] Kisswani: @mizerboy same tbh . We might be in the minority tho
[3:16:11] Dagomarus: I think the light vs void will be the one immediately after the dragon one
[3:16:14] Vexxsis: malders in the chat..geez lol
[3:16:14] smashwow: @Qargory nah, it'll be "champion, heal the wooooons"
[3:16:26] ZakuzaGB: are you just really into m+ atm? i was saying earlier ive nto seen you spam since legion it feels like
[3:16:27] Malitor: The main thing I hate with story is "supposedly" smart characters, doing dumb stuff for sake of plot

[3:16:40] Amarlian: and that's fine
[3:16:40] thiccsushi: @Nanoguts Yeah thats probably why I feel the way I do compared to being invested in the story in games like FF
[3:16:44] allenparks: Thats what I did years ago
[3:16:52] duffluv22: Again, just go to last expansion boss as long as game play is good
[3:16:56] Amarlian: I Play FFXIV and WOW both casually
[3:16:58] tigress75422: for me, if the core part of the story isnt in te game, im not comin back among other things. not buying books just to get a story. shit tatic they use to begin with
[3:17:00] WoW_StandalonE: like the majority of playerbase lol
[3:17:01] allenparks: It really is too expensive to sub permanently
[3:17:14] c0mmander_starscream: Why pay when you can just watch the cinematics on you tube?
[3:17:15] Nanoguts: yeah once most people get the mid-high tier gear lvl they give up from doing 1% increase farming
[3:17:28] theos666: @Towelliee What is the reason why blizz doesn't implement account wide everything? Is it technical problem or they are affraid people would abuse it?
[3:17:30] mavericks312: that would be a dead FF lol
[3:17:37] dankmeliodas: Not true I‚Äôve played since I was 14 years old till 30 every Xpac and patch
[3:17:46] MILESkg21: shitty story = dead game
[3:17:47] thatguynamedjans: yeah if next expansion doesnt have leveling story I dont really care. If that means more dev time for dungeons/raids im there for it
[3:17:51] Nanoguts: like rn you can get 265 gear but then after that youre gonna be farming for ur vault increases and waiting slowly on valor caps
[3:17:55] thiccsushi: FF writing team is top notch for keeping the story consistently good
[3:17:55] Dyasis: no because Square can't do no wrong to the players of FF14 in their eyes lol
[3:17:59] Nanoguts: it becomes pointless
[3:18:03] Horgoloth: since we pay for wow too they should have good storylines even if they can afford having bad ones lol
[3:18:13] SpencerHD: Yea, so the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like how the story went, I am unsubbing‚Äù is a bit of an empty threat. They finished the story, so they are unsubbing until at least Dragon‚Äôs anyway.
[3:18:19] Malitor: leveling is my favorite thing
[3:18:28] Nanoguts: sadly im just tryna get my infinite augment rune lol 65% into revered
[3:18:31] fragsta: !wow10

[3:18:43] Poriand: i kinda hope we get housing with some sort of contruction profession.
[3:18:46] Vexxsis: @Dyasis really? thats funny cause all 14 players though 1.0 was just dog shit
[3:18:47] DragonofWolves: Yeah YoshiP would be pissed if the writers wrote a bad story i think
[3:18:49] dankmeliodas: I‚Äôve been I unsub since 9.1
[3:19:04] Todmeister9000: what's gonna be the "AP" grind next expansion?
[3:19:13] ZakuzaGB: why isnt wpvp and warmode not mroe of a thing isnt that why they made it with the planes dropping stuff in the zones etc
[3:19:13] Slytha_KEKW: rofl
[3:19:13] MILESkg21: bring back Emmisaries 4Head
[3:19:15] tigress75422: unsubbing was the best thing i ever did with wow
[3:19:17] mavericks312: yea ZM is a min point to not always listen to players
[3:19:19] SensationalBanana: Lol that voice
[3:19:25] allenparks: Whenever wow releases a new area, hard core players tear through it  and 3 days later complain  they are bored
[3:19:28] Shrenko: I like ZM
[3:19:32] ILikeKillTheZombies: i would love some more transmogs for timewalking vendor
[3:19:33] gali5656: hahahaha theres ppl mad they gotta do like 2 hours of campaign for their legendary
[3:19:36] ILikeKillTheZombies: like gorehowl in HD
[3:19:37] theviperleet: @Towelliee  but not mandatory yes?
[3:19:39] daspect24: then people will complain there is too much stuff to do :P
[3:19:40] Samaellus: Dut, do not make it mandatory
[3:19:43] Recording_on_the_grass: ScaredyCat
[3:19:44] tigress75422: had good times but the game is flat out isnt good enugh from story to gameplay
[3:19:45] Samaellus: *But
[3:19:45] Qargory: DansGame but blizzard, i only want to play for 10 minutes, the wife is giving my aggro dude
[3:19:47] SpencerHD: I want my power grind back, I dislike the 30 minute loop. I like feeling that my time spent in game always equals progressing character power. I was a fan of artifact power.
[3:19:47] mavericks312: ZM would be perfect if it had a grind or 2
[3:19:47] xVeskeRx: LUL
[3:19:48] themadbunny275: grinding rep is not a big deal
[3:19:49] Rudric_Ice: Fuck REP btw
[3:19:50] dankmeliodas: More casual content is needed
[3:19:53] ryanfazz2: I agree, if they make everything account wide
[3:19:56] sir_vivec: gameplay wise i understand that WoW is superior but i dont know man im that kinda of mmo player that the story has to make sense or i get turn off dunno
[3:20:02] sipilde: Pocopoc man!
[3:20:05] ILikeKillTheZombies: Zereth mortis is pretty bland in my opinion, gameplay its okay.
[3:20:06] tigress75422: @tigress75422 3 yrs for me...left late bfa
[3:20:12] stratiss: they need to stop the timeless isle copy paste for a bit
[3:20:16] Malitor: yeah
[3:20:17] mavericks312: i only wanna play for 10 minutes head asses
[3:20:18] Rudric_Ice: let us buy the TABARD and lets us GRIND REP

[3:20:31] Dagomarus: Its best to overestimate how much content to make than underestimate, you dont want to have nothing to do a few weeks in
[3:20:32] Jonnebass: Dont make it timegated, like, you have to play every day, let me play on weekends and catch up for example.
[3:20:37] Nanoguts: yeah creation catalyst is way too long played out

[3:20:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah
[3:20:50] tommysavagex: @Towelliee it just needs to be fun, it can be a grind as long as its fun

[3:20:52] shenxue_be: i came back in wow yesterday afther 7 month brake and i must say its still boring and dead sad to see its going down always :(

[3:21:16] Hinzir: there is one thing i dont agree, then if they are packing with things to do , THEN remove time gating and make everything unlockable day 1, how about that Towelliee
[3:21:16] Clicklesly: The mount/pet farmers have plenty to grind in ZM i think?
[3:21:17] stratiss: if they do a power grind next xpac, i hope they copy LA and make everything account wide.
[3:21:35] Z3phyrusAU: You used to main a Paladin. What made you switch to a Monk?
[3:21:40] Nanoguts: people say blizzard doesnt have their hand in the world first but its some BS, the way the time gating was designed was to work around it to make it take longer imo
[3:21:41] cryft: @Kisswani i want it to take longer and also be interesting, flying is never a piece of that equation
[3:21:41] thiccsushi: I only got to ZM now to help summon people to raid LUL since I hit revered
[3:21:46] Gurtogg: i only heard the mythic raiders complain that they dont wanna have to farm rep
[3:21:50] mavericks312: give us grinds in dragon flight
[3:21:52] Thoreya: i liked bfa emissaries
[3:21:52] ILikeKillTheZombies: Emissary system from legion
[3:21:53] sir_vivec: and the system's that get abandoned each expac ?
[3:21:58] ILikeKillTheZombies: 1 kill world quests
[3:21:58] moraispt: Flying shouldnt be timegated
[3:22:00] thunder993: keep wqs and give something else too
[3:22:02] Kisswani: @cryft I would take more activities but easier to get to .
[3:22:03] sir_vivec: so much time "wasted"
[3:22:04] snake_like: Island Souls
[3:22:05] Poriand: no way they get rid of world quests lol
[3:22:09] tigress75422: wow needs a major overhaul. dont see it getting better otherwise myself
[3:22:13] thiccsushi: Give us legion emissary and world quests back those were quick and easy
[3:22:15] rohdey: wq's is a waste of development space
[3:22:16] MILESkg21: then what would they have to keep us Subbed LuL
[3:22:17] faulen: Garrison pauseChamp
[3:22:31] Horgoloth: they need to stop with AP sh!t
[3:22:33] tommysavagex: @Towelliee gw2 world events would be epic
[3:22:33] Vexxsis: GW2 prime example
[3:22:34] stallion2896: or on boat
[3:22:34] SpyCrabbo: world quests are fine as long as they don't require you to kill 20 mobs or more
[3:22:34] Malitor: I like the way Lost Ark does dailies.. you choose what you want to do and they give you extra stuff for doing them over and over
[3:22:40] cryft: @Kisswani dont you think the layout of a zone is important? you can do interesting things with layout and dangerous mob placement to make things interesting, but flying kills that
[3:22:43] dankmeliodas: Hell daily quests were better than world quests
[3:22:55] sir_vivec: oh man World vs World in wow payoS
[3:22:56] noway137: A percentage circle?
[3:22:58] Hinzir: ofc everyone does doing something more , but without timegates
[3:23:05] Nalleys: I love those sudden quests in lost ark, don't know where they are, but when I stumble upon one I get excited
[3:23:11] stratiss: 2x longer to complete
[3:23:12] Gurtogg: 2x longer
[3:23:14] Nanoguts: GW2 has huge zergs tho
[3:23:17] xALcaPWNedx: I think it sucks that after many years, we are still having such a request lol
[3:23:20] thiccsushi: World Quest 2.0 is make you waste your time doing 1 quest when you coulda did 3
[3:23:20] PvtHudson093: No one knows what WQ 2.0 is
[3:23:29] Nanoguts: in GW2 people just zerged rares to level for so long
[3:23:30] failure2: world quest 2.0 is longer quests with multiple steps within them
[3:23:33] Kisswani: @cryft which is fine for the first month . afterwards I dont need that on my alts or my main . which is why I like pathfinder as an idea
[3:23:36] JackHealMe: aw man I didn't realise it's 15 days until we find out towOof
[3:23:39] Nanoguts: kinda like how people zerg rares rn in groups
[3:23:39] stratiss: meta events
[3:23:43] snake_like: world quest 2.0 is the multiplier for how much longer they take to do
[3:23:49] faulen: invasions?
[3:23:55] JWoody82: Maybe all of the world quests can have Meaningful Choices now!
[3:23:57] Amarlian: I actually do not mind world quests, I do not like the length of time or how poor the AP rewards were at first
[3:23:59] PvtHudson093: bring back emirsary quests
[3:24:00] Vexxsis: WQ 2.0 you need to buy there battle pass to participate
[3:24:01] thiccsushi: The one thing I like about GW2 is the meta events it makes every map feel alive
[3:24:06] rohdey: how about the rares from the SL prepatch in northrend? @Towelliee
[3:24:07] Amarlian: but it shouldn't be the only thing
[3:24:10] ILikeKillTheZombies: Duskwood
[3:24:13] Nalleys: feral ass PogChamp
[3:24:14] duffluv22: World quest gear is garbage and a waste once you are over geared
[3:24:20] Kisswani: keep us out of Desolace and Silithus tho
[3:24:23] ILikeKillTheZombies: like legion prepatch
[3:24:24] themadbunny275: that would be dope
[3:24:24] snake_like: goldshire :)
[3:24:24] Aidler: world quest 2.0 = dailies
[3:24:25] DingoDip: that would be fun
[3:24:27] Vexxsis: all these zones  in wow and there not used
[3:24:32] faulen: Stormwind/Org should be the main hubs too
[3:24:38] Gurtogg: i also hate how the SL zones werent connected making traveling very tedious
[3:24:38] JediNeo99999: Taking 30 min traveling to another zone for a 5 min event isn't fun gameplay either
[3:24:39] Phil87z: Phil87z subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[3:24:39] audderd: Like the prepatch for legion
[3:24:40] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Towelliee's Road to 3K IO | Mythic Plus Keys youtu.be/3HtvsezMqjE
[3:24:46] xVeskeRx: i would love to see that
[3:24:50] stratiss: yeah and all they gotta reward is gold and mogs
[3:24:53] kokochris: I want legion style events.  they were fun
[3:24:56] TheCheeseWheel87: I just dont want to do world quest to get 252 gear 6 weeks after upgrading the research tree to tier 5 just so i can sell it for 30 gold. Getting gear that i wont use because i have out geared it since day one feels bad.
[3:25:02] kokochris: like in pre legion patch
[3:25:04] gali5656: cyphers of the first ones lacks any depth, any mob i wanna kill is easily done before pocopoc does anything
[3:25:06] Kisswani: @Gurtogg it did make sense for the story tho
[3:25:18] JackHealMe: skip first three and bring bull onto boss
[3:25:18] DingoDip: @jedineo99999 you can get anywhere in wow in 1-2 minutes...
[3:25:26] captivate7: who says the event has to last 5 mins?
[3:25:27] Vexxsis: i just want big boobed dragon chicks in the next expansion
[3:25:28] Goatsguffle: @Towelliee do you have 4pc?
[3:25:28] captivate7: can make it last longer
[3:25:33] noway137: imma take a piss during those 5 minutes, works for me
[3:25:40] Gurtogg: its 100x better being able to fly from zone to zone
[3:25:41] ILikeKillTheZombies: Add bitfrost system to Wow
[3:25:44] Gurtogg: idgaf about story
[3:25:44] JediNeo99999: LA world traveling is terrible
[3:25:46] ryanfazz2: gw2 is instant travel to anywhere
[3:26:00] ZakuzaGB: what do you think these events should give the player
[3:26:01] Amarlian: I think one of the most disappointing thing was finding out that engineering wormholes work so much better in SL. I found out way too late
[3:26:04] pereadin: timer towel
[3:26:06] ryanfazz2: they could have a hub which teleports you to one thats up
[3:26:08] captivate7: i would love world events
[3:26:09] GrailNite: Good idea
[3:26:12] PvtHudson093: you aint getting there in 10 the flight points take about that long
[3:26:13] Nanoguts: I just wish the world quests in ZM gave rep lol
[3:26:15] noway137: I think the time start is good, gives a chance to players to take smal breaks
[3:26:16] MILESkg21: true KEKW
[3:26:22] tigress75422: wow players are cancer these days im seeing
[3:26:25] captivate7: LOL this is so true
[3:26:25] DeanoTV: truuu
[3:26:28] themadbunny275: yeah that's crazy, just make it all instant content and people would complain as well
[3:26:28] mavericks312: wow players wanna log in and just get free shit these days
[3:26:29] Rudric_Ice: Imagine New World Players
[3:26:29] rohdey: i honestly wish there was more traveling
[3:26:31] Nalleys: LUL
[3:26:32] Kisswani: RESPECT MY TIME REEEEE
[3:26:33] Amarlian: should have keep the flight whistle though...
[3:26:34] captivate7: wow players nowadays are so entitled
[3:26:39] Glynn11: what's the countdown timer for?
[3:26:42] tigress75422: like they cant take good ideas or cirticisms
[3:26:46] Reckless_Monk: "you know what i could be doing in those five minutes? --- Sit in oribos"
[3:26:48] JediNeo99999: No one said that
[3:26:49] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee these aren't my grand papi's players anymore
[3:26:51] captivate7: and then bitch about no content
[3:26:52] Otton_03: And what's wrong with that?
[3:26:54] Horgoloth: IMO the problem is 50% on blizz 50%M on playerbase
[3:26:56] mavericks312: i want my 4 pc tier set while just sitting in org
[3:26:59] snake_like: now you're getting it :)
[3:27:02] Rudric_Ice: YES that how i want my game to play REEEEEEEEEE
[3:27:07] Nanoguts: alot of people do feel that way, only because they have been redoing the same grind since 2005
[3:27:07] tigress75422: i mean wow is shit now...why not have some ideas to make it better? otherwise its going to keep getting worse
[3:27:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's shallow
[3:27:10] tommysavagex: @Towelliee thye just need to make stuff fun, people will grind stuff thats fun
[3:27:12] Aidler: I travel everywhere as long as it‚Äôs not happening at a fixed time
[3:27:12] Nalleys: getting us ready to go mobile
[3:27:12] faulen: Pull timer @Towelliee
[3:27:12] xRykku: Entitled players
[3:27:14] MILESkg21: daily login rewards LuL
[3:27:18] JWoody82: Current world quests are 90% travel anyway. Fly somewhere and click a thing.
[3:27:18] iknowido: Laziness is blizzards fault
[3:27:22] Eregbueye: agree
[3:27:22] GrailNite: And the same players complain the game is to easy
[3:27:26] Z3phyrusAU: It‚Äôs not just WoW players. It‚Äôs a generational thing. It‚Äôs the MOBA / FPS generation that are used to quick reward systems.
[3:27:35] Velashen: That is probably because people are bored with the same old content loops.
[3:27:35] Nanoguts: alot of dont want to because its all borrowed power
[3:27:38] Z3phyrusAU: Blizzard just need to accommodate
[3:27:40] DragonofWolves: MilesKG21 april fools passed my brotha, stop it
[3:27:41] SensationalBanana: You need over 6k Grateful offerings to clear out all the cosmetics from the vendors. That's the major shitbag of SL for me. Renown and Anima was more than enough, why add a THIRD, hard-to-come by resource?
[3:27:44] Nanoguts: when you know your grind isnt gonan matter in a patch why would you care
[3:27:45] babadookz1251: I did 100 laps in orbos lastnight
[3:27:49] thatguynamedjans: I dont want free regular gear, but I do want instant 80 renown, and free legos so I can play my alts easier lol
[3:27:50] mavericks312: @BravehearthAU wrong
[3:27:51] Eregbueye: and the thing is that afford you pput in is the fun itself
[3:27:52] ZakuzaGB: I dont like pointing fingers but these higher level players lets say this mentality seems to trickle from there imo
[3:27:57] c0mmander_starscream: Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if most casual's would just swipe their cards to save time
[3:28:00] kokochris: maybe it's just me.  I had fond memories of having to take long travel trips and planning in asherons call.  kind of miss that myself.
[3:28:13] basedgubbs: how many hours do you have in wow
[3:28:20] Nanoguts: the way you grind and gear isnt linear which is fine but it needs to be linear in a sense when it comes to patch to patch and xpac to xpac
[3:28:21] Velashen: Borrowed power gives me very little reason to bother.
[3:28:22] 91Niki: Stop trying to please everyone, cuz you just CAN'T
[3:28:25] MILESkg21: just go the Wildstar route Kappa
[3:28:28] mavericks312: and its even worse becasue the players change there minds abotu what they want every 5 minutes
[3:28:29] Nanoguts: everytime you get a wipe reset you feel like your time is wasted
[3:28:30] duffluv22: They need to go back to basics.
[3:28:39] Gurtogg: they should start listening to john hight more
[3:28:42] noway137: IMO they should go back to being a grindy/hardcore MMO
[3:28:48] SensationalBanana: MoP had the right balance of stuff in the world and instanced content imo.
[3:28:50] noway137: Theyd get a more loyal playerbase
[3:28:51] szeeman62: @towelliee came back to wow last night lots to do but it beats having nothing left to do
[3:28:58] thasch: They should just remove flying and it have it how it was back in the day
[3:29:01] SensationalBanana: @noway137 WoW was always a casual mmo on the market.
[3:29:02] c0mmander_starscream: Those players just need to go to "Archage"
[3:29:03] Alienfromger: did i read hardcore mmo LUL
[3:29:12] dankmeliodas: If you try to make a game for everybody you end up creating a game for no one
[3:29:15] mavericks312: @noway137 but the days of hardcore mmos are over
[3:29:20] tigress75422: for me, simple...keep things simple. get rid of mandatory systems/borrowed power bs, get events going. and if ya have to travel...then travel a bit. doesnt take long
[3:29:23] ZakuzaGB: i do think some of the wow devs it feels need to be let off the leash a bit
[3:29:24] Nanoguts: I can open my account up and look at my characters from wotlk still in max gear from then, that character has zero use, its more akin to a fresh character. thats the issue imo. people hate their progress being erased or having to borrow power every single patch.
[3:29:26] MILESkg21: HARDCORE like SWTOR 4Head
[3:29:45] noway137: @mavericks312 i guess my point is, WoW's not the only "good" MMO anymore, they need to do something to differentiate themselves
[3:29:56] Nanoguts: so because of that why would you wanna farm for weeks and weeks just to know its all going away before the end of year
[3:29:59] SensationalBanana: People claiming WoW was hardcore back in the day never played any other MMOs of the time. WoW's accesibility is what made it thrive.
[3:30:02] c0mmander_starscream: @SensationalBanana  it wasnt "Casual friendly" back in '05
[3:30:17] duffluv22: I remember when I first started, I spent hours in just one zone completing quests and it was great.
[3:30:18] snake_like: do you think f&f invites for alpha will go out soon after the 10.0 announcement?
[3:30:18] noway137: LFR only came into play in Cata too
[3:30:20] SensationalBanana: @c0mmander_starscream It was casual compared to its peers.
[3:30:23] mavericks312: BC wasnt casual friendly
[3:30:30] c0mmander_starscream: ^
[3:30:42] Vexxsis: @mavericks312 bc wasnt hard core either
[3:30:45] Amarlian: @c0mmander_starscream Wow has always and will always be casual friendly, I have played this game off an on since 2004
[3:30:46] Nanoguts: example, im spending all my fucking time grinding rep for the unlimited augment rune item, is next xpac gonna make a new augment rune?
[3:30:52] Nanoguts: its that kind of design thats garbage
[3:30:53] SensationalBanana: Again, compared to other MMOs. And which of those, is still the biggest? Yeah, exactly.
[3:30:55] c0mmander_starscream: What peers? they're werent that many MMO's out in 2005
[3:30:59] Amarlian: it was casual friendly and you are fooling yourself if you think otherwise
[3:30:59] 91Niki: I LOVED the rewarding grind wow used to have. Does the grind suck for people who only have 1-3 hours a day to play? Yes. But if you only have 1-3 hours a day to play, perhaps you should set yourself lower goals in the game, rather than the same goals people who have more time to play does ü§∑
[3:31:01] Kisswani: @Nanoguts A system that lasts a year or 2 year shouldn't be thought of as transient . No piece of gear would last you that long , I hope you're not advocating for permenant gear either
[3:31:06] noway137: @c0mmander_starscream Everquest?
[3:31:26] Nanoguts: no one is advocating for permenant gear
[3:31:27] c0mmander_starscream: there's 1, and you cant compare EVE Online
[3:31:31] Nanoguts: the point is your work means nothing right now
[3:31:51] Nanoguts: unless you care about the current content for the month at a time
[3:32:09] SensationalBanana: @c0mmander_starscream EverQuest, Ultima Online, google and you'll see for yourself.
[3:32:10] tigress75422: and no invalidating content/gear from previous patches/tier either
[3:32:12] Nanoguts: its all in how you care about your progression. some dont care that they have to restart or grind agin.
[3:32:14] SpyCrabbo: when I have to actively plead with my guildmates to please just do the camapign quests to get a 2nd legendary, you know something is wrong
[3:32:19] tigress75422: make the gear last a bit longer in expansions
[3:32:23] Kisswani: @Nanoguts the covenant system was relevant for the entirety of SL . all this time can't be thought of as wasted .
[3:32:24] Spaede: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have to keep grinding the same stuff every patch‚Äù - player who cleared a +10 once and went 3/10 N in SOD‚Ä¶probably
[3:32:28] Vexxsis: *popcorn*
[3:32:34] Nanoguts: it is though
[3:32:34] noway137: Runescape, Dark Age of Camelot
[3:32:38] MoToRHeaD1973: !wow10
[3:32:38] AngelsMatt: i really hope to 10.0 to be good
[3:32:38] Moobot: @motorhead1973 World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583
[3:32:48] SensationalBanana: Oh god, Dark age of Camelot... flashbacks.
[3:32:50] SpyCrabbo: they don't want to do it, It's not fun
[3:32:56] Nanoguts: covenant might as well be passive glyphs its just all reworked shit man
[3:32:59] kokochris: @sensationalbanana don't forget asherons call.   it was not casual friendly
[3:33:05] Nanoguts: so no i dont care that it lasted me a xpac
[3:33:17] SensationalBanana: @kokochris Oh right, I tried that and noped out!
[3:33:20] racketpunch: racketpunch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 4 month streak! This WoW rant deserves a sub
[3:33:27] kanifis: it doesn't take that long
[3:33:36] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHi
[3:33:43] cryft: blizz needs to keep their xpac-long grinds taking a long time
[3:33:46] CaptainAlkohol: a lot of things in wow arent fun, but the rewards are. thats like every game ever
[3:33:49] Kisswani: Blizz kinda had no choice tho tbh
[3:33:51] Nanoguts: say i grind for exalted for the new augment rune. when the next xpac comes out is it gonna be useless? see thats my point. it applys to alot of things
[3:33:53] kokochris: @sensationalbanana I loved AC.  played in beta.   man fun times just travelling around exploring
[3:34:02] tigress75422: my fustration is with the game
[3:34:05] SaltyFelon: the loud minority reigns supreme
[3:34:06] SpyCrabbo: @kanifis anything that takes more than 5 minutes is too long
[3:34:09] Vexxsis: all i see is atm in chat is "back in my day" "hardcore"
[3:34:14] cryft: if grinds get nerfed every xpac then it doesnt feel satisfying to finish them. renown is a perfect example
[3:34:15] Nanoguts: thats alot of grinding for something that can poof in one patch
[3:34:18] Nanoguts: if they want it to poof
[3:34:21] c0mmander_starscream: Blizz needs to fire Ion
[3:34:24] mavericks312: i hope dragonflight is super grindy
[3:34:25] AngelsMatt: im ok with grindy but if this became mandatory shit again i will be pissed
[3:34:29] kanifis: @SpyCrabbo sadly
[3:34:34] 91Niki: Blizzard really really needs to stop catering to the people with 9-5 jobs
[3:34:36] Shrenko: I dont enjoy grinds that is relevant for only a few months, I like grind for big goals like GW2 has
[3:34:40] Deenzza: If u want to play the game play the game..if u dont want to play to fking play it...
[3:34:42] SensationalBanana: @kokochris Yeah my brother fell hard for that game, but WoW stole him away from all other MMOs of the time... XD
[3:34:52] Nanoguts: it does when they bring it in at the very end of the xpac
[3:34:56] MILESkg21: @91Niki Remove LFR 4Head
[3:35:01] Nanoguts: its not about trasnfering everything
[3:35:03] thiccsushi: It would be omega bloated
[3:35:09] kokochris: @sensationalbanana same.  I left AC for WoW also.  mainly because I always loved Warcraft.
[3:35:10] Nanoguts: its about transfering the HARD worked rewards
[3:35:11] snake_like: Path of Exile LUL
[3:35:15] Hinzir: it would be like path of xile
[3:35:16] Harto_: Maybe build on them instead of replacing
[3:35:16] Mikayyy: wow would get literally 0 new players, they would never be able to catch up
[3:35:18] SensationalBanana: MaKe WoW HaRdCoRe AgAiN
[3:35:20] mrsuflakis: Just give me soulshape
[3:35:21] Aidler: @towelliee omg just got my GFuel ‚ÄúThe One‚Äù
[3:35:22] Goatsguffle: I like how they did flying this expansion. But I do agree with you on having some kind of grind.
[3:35:22] mavericks312: let alone blizz would be called lazy
[3:35:24] Nanoguts: its not a budget grind LOL
[3:35:26] Skylin3r: or maybe it wouldn't have so many systems, they'd just build on previous ones
[3:35:26] Elementlolz1: artifact weapon+neck + corruption and azerite damn that a fun stuff :D
[3:35:31] Goatsguffle: I also wish they would bring back the valor system to get your gear
[3:35:33] dracullus: I would be fine with even Legion level of grinding if it would be completely account wide, alts should be just leveling&gearing
[3:35:35] Alienfromger: mmo without grind NotLikeThis
[3:35:39] Goatsguffle: because completely random just sucks
[3:35:41] Kisswani: @91Niki my dumbass brain went : " who has 5 jobs " danBrain
[3:35:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: i've had mine for a few weeks now LUL
[3:35:46] xluckydawgx: xluckydawgx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[3:35:50] Ander1345: borrowed power is fine it's about making it as alt friendly as possible
[3:35:51] rohdey: i mean unless they rip it like the 8.3 rune
[3:35:55] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee They will kill off the infinite rune like they did witht he BFA one
[3:35:57] 91Niki: @Kisswani sacLUL
[3:36:02] dankmeliodas: I was top 4 in the west for AP in Legion I loved that grind
[3:36:02] c0mmander_starscream: It's stuck in Long Beach Harbor
[3:36:03] tommysavagex: @Towelliee dont oyu think wow goes a bit overboard on systems tho?
[3:36:05] tsktsk: I think there's a missed opportunity to take certain parts of the previous expansion systems and bake them into the base class/talents though. Imagine if for DK's you had a talent choice for Abomb Limb in 10.0
[3:36:07] Amarlian: Grinds are fine, just stream line them. Do not have so many
[3:36:08] lithium364: lost ark roadmap this week maybe?
[3:36:09] Nanoguts: you are stretching what im saying, its not that they need to keep this tier in for next xpac or some dumb system, its about keeping certain things that are yes, optional but also takes ALOT of work
[3:36:13] Pacificooler: I think expansions having their own system is fine. It gives expansions their own identity. We get to look back and remember Legion artifacts, for example
[3:36:20] thiccsushi: @Kisswani People on wow forums got 5 jobs wives and kids then when they login for their 5min a day want to feel rewarded
[3:36:29] hateful88: Launch of a new xpac: This is great, oh wait this is grindy AF with no respect for my time until the last patch
[3:36:29] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[3:36:30] Nanoguts: like yeah they wouldnt keep tier sets
[3:36:31] AngelsMatt: @lithium364 they said taht will be a road mapa of 2 month i guess
[3:36:33] mrsuflakis: 5 leggos
[3:36:44] Nanoguts: im saying hard worked for REP based rewards or other things that can take you months
[3:36:52] cryft: throw free legendaries in the garbage
[3:36:53] 91Niki: @MilesKG21 That's not what I said
[3:36:57] Nanoguts: not the entire game transferring lol
[3:36:57] AngelsMatt: dude SL was the same shit system of BFA
[3:36:57] cryft: orange item is trash now
[3:37:01] SaltyFelon: bro i get so many tanks that randomly pull the bosses around the room for no reason
[3:37:14] thiccsushi: LFR should be for STORY purposes only imo
[3:37:15] Nanoguts: exaltd takes a MONTH minimum
[3:37:16] Kheonik: @tsktsk they do that though, they added some legion legendaries to the talent trees.
[3:37:18] kanifis: months?
[3:37:19] MILESkg21: MONTHS DansGame
[3:37:20] mavericks312: your reaching with that
[3:37:28] lithium364: @Towelliee you think we get multiple videos on 19 like "system deep dive" "story" etc or just an 30 mins video?
[3:37:28] Nalleys: months LUL
[3:37:37] Nanoguts: im reaching that ZM takes at least a month to get exalted?
[3:37:38] thunder993: barely and rep takes more then 3 weeks
[3:37:40] Teddsan: less RnG overall would be amazing
[3:37:42] thunder993: any*
[3:37:49] alex12645: i thought you love to grind
[3:37:53] 91Niki: @Teddsan sacWAVE
[3:37:55] dym_jt: For people that work and have other shit to do, then months might be realistc.
[3:37:56] thatguynamedjans: its about not timegating fun. Ive done full clear normal and most of heroic every week for 4 weeks and havent gotten my 2 piece tier yet lol. With 5+options in vault every week lol
[3:37:58] Mikayyy: exactly
[3:37:59] gali5656: i get mine next week :)
[3:38:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: Lost ark has a rapport npc that takes 71 days to max out if you don't use gifts LUL
[3:38:03] Eregbueye: 6months of 8 hours a day
[3:38:04] Teddsan: hey niki :)
[3:38:09] Clicklesly: ZM exalted would be 2-3 months fairly casual logging i guess
[3:38:10] MILESkg21: TEDD in da house PogChamp
[3:38:14] SpyCrabbo: @Nanoguts "a month" is very different from "months"
[3:38:16] Clicklesly: No boss grind etc
[3:38:18] Reckless_Monk: TRUUUUEEEEEEEE
[3:38:19] cryft: NO the augment rune is a perfect example. it's just a quality of life thing to be proud of
[3:38:20] Nanoguts: you stretched it again, i never said 4 months man. even if its ONE month of DAILY log in grinding which it is
[3:38:20] SaltyFelon: cant you get a contract to make all the world quests give you rep with ZM
[3:38:23] Nanoguts: then thats enough imo
[3:38:30] mavericks312: the minute they said monthes there argument was invalid
[3:38:33] Shrenko: @datguynamedjans have you atleast gotten 1 piece?
[3:38:38] Nanoguts: everyones time is valued differently right
[3:38:41] thunder993: @nanoguts you said months not month
[3:38:46] Amarlian: @SaltyAlfredo yes, it will give you a whole 10 rep
[3:38:46] Crohnnn: Wait are you still on a Subathon?
[3:38:52] Nanoguts: nothing wrong but then it goes away lol
[3:38:53] Mikayyy: oh no a month
[3:39:00] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:39:01] MILESkg21: KEKW
[3:39:02] kanifis: LUL
[3:39:03] thatguynamedjans: @Shrenko Yes, I have one piece haha.
[3:39:05] lithium364: there are no casual weapons or trinkets in zm
[3:39:05] UnknownLegendDPS: you people D:
[3:39:06] Alienfromger: you people D:
[3:39:06] Nanoguts: no one is complaining about the grind
[3:39:07] justnthyme: how about we just stop using mobile-game esque timegating in our monthly sub game
[3:39:09] thiccsushi: @datguynamedjans I got 3 pieces in my first 2 resets but now I feel cock teased every week I dont get the last one
[3:39:10] rohdey: here we go, attempt 159 at this stupid fkn horse
[3:39:10] SaltyFelon: @SaltyAlfredo ahhh so just go around and kill rares
[3:39:14] Vexxsis: basically handing it to you.........
[3:39:15] Clicklesly: Quick deathskip tactics Kappa
[3:39:16] Eregbueye: im pepel
[3:39:23] noway137: @rohdey which one?
[3:39:26] dankmeliodas: I‚Äôd like to see some 10mqn  content brought back in the game but I know it won‚Äôt happen
[3:39:27] 91Niki: @Towelliee I don't care if there is a ton of grind in the game, as long as it's rewarding. The people who complain about grind, are the people who set themselves too high expectations compared to the time they have to play. Nobody says you HAVE to do it all.
[3:39:27] mavericks312: imagine if we had the BC grinds today
[3:39:33] Vexxsis: whiny players want it now
[3:39:36] rohdey: ICC
[3:39:38] dankmeliodas: *man
[3:39:38] cryft: @SaltyAlfredo contract makes all shadowlands world quests add 10 enlightened (or whatever contract) rep
[3:39:40] AngelsMatt: @justnthyme wow at this point should f2p mmo
[3:39:41] Moobot: Did you know this drop was designed in Photoshop? Students get the whole Adobe Creative suitefor just $19.99/month http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html
[3:39:43] Nanoguts: lmao BC grinds arent even the same
[3:39:43] Shrenko: @datguynamedjans well I dont have 1 piece !!! 4 full vaults except pvp , 4 clears on raid on normal and 3 bosses that drops tier piece on Heroic ...
[3:39:49] MetalJoshP: One month in mmo life is like 5 days people want instant gratification in the game now
[3:39:51] Hinzir: if its exalted reward after 3 months of daily, it should be free not 42k gold, augment rune thing,
[3:39:59] stallowned: BC was alot of rep grind, wasnt that bad
[3:40:02] hyndinho: kinda ez? its fuccking childsplay nowdays
[3:40:02] MILESkg21: cant wait to Rep Farm ICC next year Kreygasm
[3:40:08] rohdey: onto 160 Kappa towCry
[3:40:08] JediNeo99999: Tier this time around is a way bigger power gain than previously
[3:40:14] Reckless_Monk: Raid was only way to get tier

[3:40:16] noway137: @Towelliee even mounts have gotten "casual" like remember poundfist or other rare spawns?
[3:40:16] Nanoguts: ive been playing since 2005 man Im not new to this IM just saying that at the end of the day my point is borrowed power gets old when you know whats coming you dont want to grind as much
[3:40:19] Nanoguts: thats not just me
[3:40:19] dankmeliodas: I actually enjoyed the old rep grinds
[3:40:21] Vexxsis: bc grinds were what they were because we didnt have the online strats and resources we have now
[3:40:24] duffluv22: The fact is that people who played WoW in the beginning are grown and dont have the time to play like they had when they were younger because of grown up responsibilities. WoW is trying to cater to these people now instead of keeping the game the way that made it an actual good game.
[3:40:28] justnthyme: timegating shouldn't exist, we should be able to do as much in one day as we want, locking people into dailys is the lazy way out of designing good progression content
[3:40:28] Teddsan: yeh but master loot eliminated alot of RnG not saying for pugs but for guilds for sure
[3:40:28] alex12645: we have it spoon feed to us now
[3:40:32] cryft: @Hinzir if you play for 3 months with one item in mind, you can save the cash
[3:40:33] Shrenko: Im gonna skip WOTLK classic, cant stand the zones üò†
[3:40:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: imagine doing dozens of mythic dungeons and not getting your legion legendary you need for raids, oh wait i member
[3:40:47] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[3:40:55] MILESkg21: @Shrenko D: take that back
[3:41:10] Nanoguts: I'ive been playing since 2005, I'm not some new player who crys about grinding, I've done my share in wow and thats my point really. Its the constant bowered power and droped dead content, Im sorry dude.
[3:41:17] mavericks312: horrible take
[3:41:19] tigress75422: then u in the minority.
[3:41:20] cryft: locking things to dailys and time gating is to level the playing field between people who can play a lot or a little
[3:41:23] Shrenko: @MilesKG21 no üò°
[3:41:24] kanifis: yeah fk that
[3:41:29] CritcobainTV: üò° Tried to put a fan from the PC i have into the PC you gave me and they have different connectors so I can't Sadge
[3:41:31] cryft: which sucks
[3:41:35] stratiss: I'm okay with a grind, just don't make the grind mandatory on alts
[3:41:39] thorined: thats terrible idea people will burn themselves out and them blame the game for it
[3:41:44] Vexxsis: thats another "i want" wow player
[3:41:45] tigress75422: fuck timegating to begin with. rather play other games still than the whole time gaing bullshit wow has
[3:41:46] NiXProdigy: they should just make it like the pvp conquest system. you can grind to the same point everyone else gets to
[3:41:46] Velladyn: People do that shit in Everquest, I did that and it sucks so much ass grinding rep from base to exalted
[3:41:50] thunder993: things being timegated actually helps casuals, if nothing is timegated infinte grinding is rewarded
[3:41:50] MetalJoshP: To an extant but I don‚Äôt agree either there needs to be time gates for certain things
[3:41:50] faulen: That's the "lock it behind a paywall" mentality. Time gate is not lazy
[3:41:50] stallowned: then they complain they have nothing to do after FailFish
[3:41:51] dankmeliodas: There should always be something you should want to grind
[3:42:00] Nanoguts: people already burn themsleves out regardless lol
[3:42:06] 91Niki: "but Towelliee, I work a 9-5 and don't have 40 hours to play BabyRage Blizzard should cater to me reeeee" LUL
[3:42:08] Vexxsis: then have nothing to do later right?
[3:42:18] Nanoguts: not everything needs to be timegated but somethings should be 100%
[3:42:18] MetalJoshP: More Horizontal progression systems and gameplay is what is needed
[3:42:19] Tyduss89: when do you think next expac will be out? estimated date?
[3:42:19] mavericks312: timegating is here to keep players coming back
[3:42:20] zodd_amhai: !WOW10
[3:42:20] Moobot: @zodd_amhai World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583
[3:42:22] faulen: or they will complain they have to do it again on an alt LUL
[3:42:22] Reckless_Monk: Max from Limit said it.. You get all Best in slot gear, and you will stop playing. MMOs are made to make you feel like your toon is getting powerful throughout time
[3:42:24] megazeusthor: Grind with a pay to almost bas a good option? Guys who have less time and more money can still stay relevant but not as good as the hardcore grinders.
[3:42:24] MILESkg21: do want a Grind or do you like everything at once
[3:42:27] Velashen: Just make everything account based. It pretty much fixes most complaints here.
[3:42:29] hateful88: That same mentality is coming from the same people who complain about having nothing to do 1 week in a patch.
[3:42:29] Hinzir: just because you cant do, you wanna bloack ppl who can grind 48 hours, thats earned, not free, just like RWF race , guilds play non stop everyday. How about timegate that too  ?
[3:42:34] tigress75422: if timegating wasnt in wow and it had no mandatory systems in place id still be playing
[3:42:37] Nanoguts: yeah max is always ina  top guild
[3:42:39] AngelsMatt: i dont think so towel
[3:42:40] cryft: i want grinds to take a long time, but also not be time gated. that way i can put my time where i want to instead of tagging all these super high value 1-off activities all the time
[3:42:40] Nanoguts: who buys their tier
[3:42:42] Nanoguts: so idc
[3:42:42] nemees1s: People are only happy if they have something to complain about and if theres nothing to complain about they will make up something to complain about
[3:42:44] nephttv_: rest in peace me
[3:42:46] Z3phyrusAU: You‚Äôre a steamer - you don‚Äôt seem to mind grinding. The average person doesn‚Äôt want to spend weeks grinding reputation
[3:42:47] thiccsushi: @stallowned I love when people do that KEKW
[3:42:49] dankmeliodas: We need to interact with the world more have things change from week to week
[3:42:51] extrnl2: wow this chat dumb af LOL
[3:43:08] kanifis: this is an overload of bad takes
[3:43:12] 91Niki: @nemees1s Exactly
[3:43:13] extrnl2: people think being able to do all the grinding in 48 hours is less work than doing it over 2 weeks?
[3:43:13] Vexxsis: @BravehearthAU streamer or not, its a  mmo , mmos always have grinds
[3:43:14] Nanoguts: I can't listen to top guilds complain because they literally have gear handed to them now by other players. if they cry about getting BiS and being bored its their fault
[3:43:19] tutelemucnher: when do server reset
[3:43:21] snake_like: just more account wide stuff and I'm happy
[3:43:22] Amarlian: @hateful88 Sometimes it's worse. They see their favorite streamer has all the gear and rep and completed everything even if they personally havent and assume the game is done.
[3:43:23] cryft: like if i want to put a whole day towards enlightened rep, i should be able to. i dont want it over fast, i just want to choose what to do without feeling like im wasting time
[3:43:28] dracullus: armchair devs always have these genius ideas and later they have audacity to tell that Blizz should fire this or this person
[3:43:28] Nanoguts: the rest of us are time gated from tier when they are given it
[3:43:36] faulen: The time gating makes since on a story level.
[3:43:37] AngelsMatt: id prefer a good content,good design if i can finish in 2 wee to 2 month good now i unsub and go play other games
[3:43:39] mavericks312: mmos are meant to have grinds not give you participation rewards
[3:43:42] Kisswani: POGGERS
[3:43:42] Qargory: think creation catalyst is too far out? feel like it could be here sooner than it is
[3:43:43] MILESkg21: AP Grind Kreygasm
[3:43:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: I liked the AP grinds
[3:43:45] noway137: @Towelliee Like I gotta do Tooki for 30 days for a giant heart, it sucks but you live with it KEKW
[3:43:50] MetalJoshP: It‚Äôs all about balancing vertical and horizontal progression gameplay have enough of each to keep you engaged playing because you want to while having some things you need to play to progress the problem is there isn‚Äôt much good horizontal right now but they have improved
[3:43:51] Shrenko: peepoLeave
[3:43:54] Reckless_Monk: @Nanoguts No it would be the common player. the none WF players would get bored
[3:43:56] thatguynamedjans: Timegating bad luck protection is just bad game design in my opinion.
[3:43:57] thiccsushi: I Didn't mind the artifact grind after NH tbh
[3:44:03] Teddsan: there will never be a system that satisfies all cuz theres different demographics that play wow now
[3:44:04] Ander1345: a variety of grinds is prob best overall, with having the "necessary" stuff somewhere in the middle
[3:44:05] darkdestroz: id take corruption back, TD is fun XD
[3:44:13] SaltyFelon: If timegating wasnt a thing though people would find a way to exploit it and get shit super fast and then would complain that there's nothing to do
[3:44:15] tigress75422: gotta love ppl still simping for wow kinda funny
[3:44:16] cryft: huge reward for your first dungeon of the week is too much incentive to do dungeons. it's a chore now.
[3:44:18] 91Niki: @megazeusthor The issue is more people who have less time to play, set the same expectations as people who have a ton of time to play. You don't HAVE to do everything. Some people play wow and NEVER touch dungeons. Only do quests and solo content, and have fun. It's possible.
[3:44:23] lithium364: why is noone thinking about the children chat
[3:44:26] Valaurus: hot take I guess? As a casual I honestly didn't mind Artifact Power. I never felt like I was behind, and I never really grinded it
[3:44:26] Nanoguts: @Reckless_Monk how so bro half these players in echo arent gonna be daily because they are in 278 next week lol
[3:44:29] Broomba: people have their idea of a perfect game or mmo, but one doesnt exist and still complain
[3:44:29] Vexxsis: i think you need to take your self back to CoD if you are complaining about a grind in a mmo
[3:44:38] thunder993: @tigress75422 says a person watching a wow stream
[3:44:44] kanifis: KEKW
[3:44:53] UnknownLegendDPS: fuck them kids
[3:44:55] UnknownLegendDPS: KEKW
[3:44:55] Proto_Paradigm: @Towelliee I remember the Netherwing egg grind.  I had a mental orgasm when I finally dinged exalted and got the dragon.  Good quest line too.  They should do something like that again instead of just A-B missions and nothing else.
[3:44:57] cryft: great vault is a disaster
[3:45:00] mavericks312: @Nanoguts wrong echo still logs in everyday for sale runs/reclears on other toons
[3:45:01] Arms_Warrior: what happens in 15 days
[3:45:10] SaltyFelon: ive played since 2016 and never raided but id really like to get into it with this new raid
[3:45:13] Kisswani: @ARMS_WARRlOR new wow expansion reveal
[3:45:14] thiccsushi: Just get your kids to do the grind for you as chores and reward them with allowance Kappa
[3:45:16] Nanoguts: you need to split the idea that its about people simply crying on a grind versus pepple who dont mind the grind but want the reward to not last a week
[3:45:18] Nanoguts: lmfao
[3:45:20] Amarlian: @megazeusthor That's me! I do not have time to do mythics and honestly would love it if Heroics could give something worthwhile every once in a while but they are just worthless now
[3:45:24] kanifis: @tigress75422 haHAA
[3:45:24] Arms_Warrior: Kisswani thanks
[3:45:27] Broomba: @ARMS_WARRlOR the end of the world
[3:45:31] MILESkg21: 6k mage OMEGALUL
[3:45:31] Reckless_Monk: @Nanoguts They still need to play the game, to keep up with their toons for their next WF race. I would be bored if I got everything up front. I love seeing my toon get powerful week to week
[3:45:34] TheLoho: your mage is uh... not it
[3:45:36] Nanoguts: I didnt say echo doesnt log in i said in a week or two when alt famr is over
[3:45:37] Nanoguts: they wont be
[3:45:40] Nanoguts: until next tier
[3:45:45] Arms_Warrior: Broomba I wouldnt mind it
[3:45:46] Nanoguts: its the same every single time are you new to this
[3:45:51] Ander1345: seems a little low but way higher than i could ever do.... lul
[3:45:56] Broomba: @ARMS_WARRlOR KEKW
[3:46:03] mavericks312: again wrong top guilds will still be logging in for sale runs
[3:46:14] Nanoguts: lmfao thats the point man
[3:46:15] JumpTroopC5: @ander1345 thinking the same haha
[3:46:18] Nanoguts: totally flying by your head
[3:46:25] nephttv_: tow look overall
[3:46:29] Nanoguts: making money isnt playing the game for fun its a buisness for them
[3:46:33] nephttv_: you'll see why it feels like low dps
[3:46:52] 91Niki: @Amarlian I used to Mythic raid and do high keys back in Legion. Really enjoyed it. Now I'm just a casual, cuz I don't have the mental health for the hardcore stuff. I still have fun, even if I don't touch raids and m+
[3:46:59] Nanoguts: exactly
[3:47:12] Hinzir: I would like to see raiding and m+ timegated to 2hours max per day too. Since they are timegating repuƒ±tation and dailies like that.
[3:47:22] Nanoguts: cause they bought tier they have 40k to blow on gear
[3:47:24] Hinzir: See what happens after that, chaos
[3:47:27] Kisswani: I'm different as well danDerp
[3:47:29] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  echo might be doing mdi practice
[3:47:32] Nanoguts: the normal player might not get 4pc till catalyst comes out
[3:47:33] UnknownLegendDPS: dont care about mounts DansGame
[3:47:36] Nanoguts: just how it is
[3:47:36] 91Niki: @Amarlian It's about setting realistic expectations that fits you
[3:47:39] lithium364: chameleon mount when
[3:47:41] leavedevil: rogerbrown is a collector
[3:47:42] Amarlian: @91Niki as long as you find your fun, it's great. I take long breaks too and it can help. I am a true LFR hero though
[3:47:47] Vexxsis: fucking losers , not wanting mounts

[3:48:11] Stalownage: Tier gear shouldnt come out exclusively to just raiders for the first 2 months of the patch. Allow us to get it from pvp as well or have pvp have its own tier sets
[3:48:14] Nanoguts: no one ever kills the relic buffs bruh i cant stand it lol
[3:48:14] Hinzir: @mavericks312 no it was only for 1 boss
[3:48:26] JumpTroopC5: Yeah my friends and I are mounts, transmogs, and pets. Heck we would love the garrisons to still be a thing. @towelliee
[3:48:37] Velladyn: @Amarlian LFR hero here as well, do not have the mental space to deal with raid leaders and/or crazy stuff in my late 30's lol
[3:48:38] thunder993: @stallowned you can get tier from pvp and m+ in vault options for pvp and m+
[3:48:40] Teddsan: he collects world firsts Kappa
[3:48:45] Qargory: @Stalownage it comes out of vault too
[3:48:46] Vexxsis: m so glad i dont play wow SeemsGood

[3:49:12] Nalleys: THD is still collecting pearls
[3:49:19] Thoreya: think max was sayin hes prob gonna play this patch
[3:49:20] Nanoguts: going thru the premade group finder for heroic ZM? yeah that can be a mess
[3:49:33] cryft: tier gear should come exclusively from raid, and only be bis for raiders
[3:49:33] Draethar: @Towelliee Thoughts on the leak?

[3:50:13] Vexxsis: waiting for the division heartland in the coming few months
[3:50:13] cryft: for the same reason, pvp gear should only come from pvp and be bis for pvp
[3:50:20] Ander1345: i kinda hope the leak is just next level misdirection
[3:50:22] dankmeliodas: I gave up on Lostark like 3 weeks ago
[3:50:26] shaddzz: whats a good class for a returning player to shadowlands?
[3:50:27] MILESkg21: you dont quit .. you just take a break Kappa
[3:50:33] thiccsushi: I got to T2 in lost ark and took a break I'll check it out again in a year once things are fleshed out more
[3:50:38] cryft: blizz has no idea what bis is going to be when they design gear so it's always a huge failure
[3:50:40] noway137: I feel like Lost Ark resets aren't thaaaat big of a deal
[3:50:42] Shrenko: @UnknownLegendDPS me too :D I took a year break or something playing many different other games but Im enjoying 9.2. Im just farming achievements when Im not raiding or doing m+
