[0:13:10] NerdRagedOut: ayyyy
[0:13:18] Rhop: But if you hold it you're grounding it
[0:13:22] JackOfAllApocalypses: well I can DEFINITELY hear it now
[0:13:36] JackOfAllApocalypses: well..until you unplugged it
[0:13:48] Clarius: ye

[0:14:08] JackOfAllApocalypses: now it's back yeah
[0:14:10] guynormally: my mixer causes a lot of static if I don't have a certain switch on. the switch has nothing to do with the mic, but for whatever reason it solves the issue. could be anything, good luck
[0:14:12] JackOfAllApocalypses: when you moved it up
[0:14:15] Spritesgud: lets gooo shure sm7b for life
[0:14:16] Rhop: It's a USB interface right?
[0:14:36] Rhop: Could be a bad USB cable. Those things are terrible with interference
[0:14:41] Spritesgud: im team plug your interface into another outlet on a different circuit
[0:15:46] adardrae: same circuit most likely anyway
[0:15:55] imChaotic__: have you tried rice?
[0:16:02] Spritesgud: you might have an open ground on your circuit, do you have an outlet tester
[0:16:08] PrinceLuTen: I havent been on stream when it was started up
[0:16:15] PrinceLuTen: jesus this has gotten hectic
[0:16:15] iDeez88: geek squad time

[0:16:19] Pyrrha_GG: did you have any electrical work done in the house recently?

[0:16:43] DecayingPopcorn: Not the surveillance system?
[0:16:47] travakal: Didnt you just have cameras put in bro?
[0:17:08] adardrae: gfci probably tripped due to water
[0:17:11] Spritesgud: then its on a different circuit, wouldnt matter
[0:17:32] asd123qwerty1: maybe fork in outlet garf
[0:17:45] hottfuzz24: ghost busters
[0:17:45] dumnerd: electrician
[0:17:46] GrimFandango: @asd123qwerty1 that's true, you should lick the fork to find out
[0:17:46] adardrae: audio person
[0:17:48] Alarius_: yea
[0:17:49] alandiamond12: ghost busters

[0:17:54] fzybny: Sound engineer
[0:17:56] Joneim: Im gonna start just posting random abbreviations to fit in
[0:18:00] Pyrrha_GG: i have bad wiring in my garage that when its under load causes my computer to have coil whine, so maybe some bad circuit somewhere causing interference
[0:18:05] getlazy: does TL have someone maybe?
[0:18:06] Spritesgud: just buy a $10 klein outlet tester, plug it into the current outlet that is giving issues, it'll tell you if you have an open ground
[0:18:10] JackOfAllApocalypses: in LA? probably
[0:18:13] Pyrrha_GG: go steal one from a theater
[0:18:15] Madgeneto: dogs be squeeking
[0:18:19] fzybny: TL staff should have a sound guy right?
[0:18:20] iDeez88: craigslist probably has some stable people to help
[0:18:26] Spritesgud: if it doesn't give you an error light then it's not the outlet, it's somewhere upstream from that
[0:18:31] baileys243: sorry just got here, you hear buzzing on your mic? That would be a ground issue for the MIC
[0:18:35] travakal: I have no idea how that all works...but that is the only recent variable change is my only point.  Problems like that are so annoying, because it could be so many things
[0:18:38] thataj101: is your mic directly into PC or USB Hub?
[0:18:46] Spritesgud: well towards your computer not towards the breaker
[0:18:47] professor_cullman: I think there's a duck stuck in the microphone causing the issue
[0:18:54] winterstretch: @baileys243 this has been established i think already - its been happening for a while
[0:19:10] iamdrewonline: is the mic usb or xlr?
[0:19:12] baileys243: ahh, sorry.
[0:19:22] thataj101: dont use USB hub

[0:20:54] adardrae: it does seem like it's a grounding issue with noise in the signal

[0:21:55] GrimFandango: as a chatter, I don't know what's going on
[0:22:05] Benjg7: it could be several things, anyone from chat trying to diagnose without seeing it is literally just guessing

[0:27:35] SacsTvT: @Maximum you have a decreasing utility function that is an inverse exponential as costs get higher...
[0:27:36] GrimFandango: NOTED

[0:28:04] healapotamus: @maximum I saw on the Titanforge podcast they were talking about key depletion and their solutions seemed to center around let’s fix it above 25’s(no depletion) but like well someone doing 20’s somehow love to get a Thrones 21 and that’s ok. I mean if it’s bad fix it for everyone right? any takes on it?
[0:28:07] SacsTvT: marginal utility* I.e. the derivative is changing. super standard
[0:28:10] fire127: EZ
[0:28:28] menacingtrees: max shut up im answering you xD  ***

[0:29:31] analog_guyz: more price less product right ?
[0:29:31] itsRMP: i mean aint no way people are locked in on the graph rn
[0:29:32] ahri_feet_connoisseur: it’s not wrong just weird orientation

[0:29:54] Benjg7: Those are the shit
[0:30:00] Benjg7: maybe overkill
[0:30:08] Benjg7: for what you need but they are fucking sick
[0:30:17] analog_guyz: @Virridian ye mb
[0:30:22] menacingtrees: mm. i come at this from audio engineering perspective so not sure what would be best for your usecase
[0:30:27] Nox1o: that looks like some high end stuff that requires a lot of attention and problem solving KEKW
[0:30:28] hobit0213: volt is good

[0:32:19] LionButLeon: Mike RAGEY
[0:32:21] Chevy454_: Have you checked your cable connections to ensure your grounded
[0:32:25] PrinceLuTen: I dont think your issue is hardware, I think those are just natty dogs
[0:32:29] CalibungleJustJohnP: i assume you have tried a ground loop isolator?
[0:32:30] Jarlan23: tie a rubber band on the bottom of the mic
[0:32:43] NupidstoobTV: Are your wall sockets grounded?
[0:32:50] alkanphell: @Maximum is ur ground fixed?
[0:32:52] Spritesgud: Max one weird last thing, can you take that mic off the mic arm and set it down on the desk?
[0:32:53] Raging_Titan92: have a seperate ground wire bond to the audio system
[0:32:58] rozlotte: Just rewire your entire house
[0:33:03] Squats3: @Maximum did that thing help or naw. i just got here
[0:33:05] qtceef: dont find out
[0:33:12] combobulous: take mic off mic arm
[0:33:12] Rhop: You probably want the Apollo Twin DUO USB3 for your use case
[0:33:15] combobulous: does it still happen
[0:33:16] VenoFrog: @Maximum was it the 5g burther? KKona
[0:33:20] Alarius_: security system is relevant
[0:33:21] Squats3: thats a no
[0:33:22] alandiamond12: i GOT THE SOLUTION!  Move.  There, that'll solve it
[0:33:24] Chevy454_: you can goto lowes or hardware store and quickly find a outlet tester that checks ground
[0:33:25] thataj101: do you have a UPS with inverter?
[0:33:25] Jarlan23: if the static only goes away if youre squeezing the bottom of the mic just put a rubber band around it
[0:33:26] alandiamond12: haha
[0:33:30] Spritesgud: I've had an issue with a mic being mounted one time, try to set it just down on your desk and see if the arm is suddenly causing some issues
[0:33:32] Azikielboi: why not just get a new one of what u arleady had? it worked a good long time didnt it?
[0:33:38] menacingtrees: volt is irrelevant to you]
[0:33:38] Rhop: Apollo Twin DUO USB3
[0:33:39] OG_Kawngi: next step is to buy a new house unfortunately
[0:33:42] sethron: didn't you get a new security system installed? could that be interfering somehow?
[0:33:44] Alarius_: i'd move the setup to another room and test before spending $3500
[0:33:45] lockjaw570: play sod
[0:33:45] emarol_dk: there is no Hi-Fi shops in your town?

[0:36:08] Tycan_Cant_Tank: is it an intel motherboard?
[0:36:09] LionButLeon: Pikachu Pog
[0:36:14] Ronangic: no
[0:36:17] TheFamilyHorde: Intel exclusive.
[0:36:18] Rhop: Depends on generation of USB-C
[0:36:20] TheFamilyHorde: Get the USB
[0:36:30] TheFamilyHorde: No reason to get the thunderbolt.
[0:36:31] menacingtrees: almost everything is saying this is overkill for streaming so you should be good LOL
[0:36:36] Rhop: Twin X is just better
[0:36:39] Genesis1_: Type C and thunderbolt are the same connector but different functions, USB C with a lightning bolt
[0:36:40] yelp26: The go XLR has a great open source software that's still being continued
[0:36:44] Esoteryc: The new version of USP support rhunderbolt
[0:36:44] LionButLeon: xdd
[0:36:46] bazooka_steve: i believe the left one is for mac

[0:37:05] TheFamilyHorde: You use a Mac ever?
[0:37:18] adammeowington: just tape your hand to the mic xdd
[0:37:18] CalibungleJustJohnP: that static is mental, the fact its happening when you release, means something isnt grounded from what i have read on stuffs
[0:37:20] Yagr6: i see specs on your twitch just below the stream
[0:37:21] scopeys112: system info
[0:37:33] TheFamilyHorde: @Genesis1_ Now. Was intel only and if he ever goes AMD he's gonna regret.
[0:37:35] AoPsyke: I guess seeing you holding on to your mic for dear life, the static aint fixed yet
[0:37:39] alkanphell: @Maximum that interface is rly good,if u ever want to record/mix even better
[0:37:41] Bobba32: you can just run DXDIAG program (its on every pc) and see whats in there
[0:37:51] tertofsky: use cpu-z
[0:37:52] Velocitee_c: Velocitee_c subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Woo! A massive 2 months

[0:38:16] menacingtrees: yeet
[0:38:33] menacingtrees: if this doesnt solve it, the problem wasnt the interface lmao
[0:38:34] TheFamilyHorde: @Genesis1_ Did you just assume my gender?
[0:38:53] Genesis1_: @Genesis1_ nope just your intelligence

[0:39:06] gizzm0e: 1/4 inch
[0:39:06] jarmotron: 1/4"
[0:39:08] adammeowington: 6,3 jack
[0:39:12] combobulous: 3.5mm they make adapters
[0:39:13] TheFamilyHorde: :rofl:
[0:39:19] scopeys112: you can use them for studio monitors
[0:39:26] Rhop: 3.5mm is the current one you have.
[0:39:27] menacingtrees: ya
[0:39:32] rawrage2: 3.5 = aux
[0:39:38] poroyou: yea
[0:39:39] Rhop: 6.25mm or 1/4" is the bigger one
[0:39:41] menacingtrees: now this is an excuse to get some banging studio speakers
[0:39:44] adammeowington: 6,3 jack to 3,5 probably
[0:39:45] Mirhi: yeah its 1/4 inch
[0:39:45] menacingtrees: its a TLR
[0:39:46] greyst: that's quarter inch
[0:39:47] gizzm0e: it's 1/8 inch and 1/4 inch
[0:40:07] Gamerhcp: yes
[0:40:09] menacingtrees: ya
[0:40:12] Mirhi: Yes, it has 2 line out it looks like
[0:40:14] adammeowington: theres 2x L and R out
[0:40:14] menacingtrees: they are 2 cables for 2 speakers
[0:40:15] alkanphell: @Maximum u could have 4 speakers
[0:40:22] scopeys112: because space
[0:40:23] hobit0213: stereo
[0:40:26] Rhop: Stereo monitoring
[0:40:28] hobit0213: left and right
[0:40:29] Gamerhcp: its for pro audio people
[0:40:31] Mirhi: stereo monitoring
[0:40:32] menacingtrees: cause this is serious busiense
[0:40:32] othernewname: cause u have L and R ? xdd
[0:40:33] combobulous: stereo
[0:40:33] greyst: two monitors
[0:40:33] Gamerhcp: no
[0:40:35] Rhop: So you can run it to two speakers without a splitter
[0:40:38] toique: tjose are speaker monitors
[0:40:55] PrinceLuTen: There is a guy in chat @Benjg7 that uses these
[0:40:58] Rhop: The front monitor input is for headphones ye
[0:40:58] Gamerhcp: YEP
[0:40:59] menacingtrees: ya
[0:40:59] hobit0213: yup
[0:41:00] jarmotron: yes
[0:41:01] Spritesgud: correct
[0:41:01] scopeys112: YEP
[0:41:01] Rhop: The rear ones are for speakers
[0:41:02] adammeowington: yes
[0:41:13] Gamerhcp: magic probably
[0:41:16] toique: @Maximum monitors are type of speakers
[0:41:19] alkanphell: @Maximum becase for us studio guyz we have more moitors we mix and test on diffrent speakers. U could do Monitor L/R and use Line to feed to other eqipent. Just use montior one : )
[0:41:19] menacingtrees: cant wait to hear max's new EP gna drop after buying this
[0:41:26] vorsmyth: Monitor in this context is the speaker you would put on a stage for the talent to hear themselves, with split you can run them sterio
[0:41:27] scopeys112: of course the pre amp is goona be strong on this model
[0:41:30] hobit0213: dial is for the volume etc
[0:41:37] Rhop: The monitor and preamp buttons change what the dial does
[0:41:50] menacingtrees: ya

[0:42:06] TirrinWoW: sweetwater
[0:42:08] Gutshots: Radio shack
[0:42:10] PrinceLuTen: @Maximum It is overkill in difficulty of use I guess
[0:42:13] rzz433: mcd
[0:42:14] d0mezg4mer: sweetwater is good
[0:42:19] vorsmyth: sweetwater is the go to for audio online
[0:42:21] alkanphell: sweetwater is nice shop
[0:42:25] PrinceLuTen: Not like excessive for your needs
[0:42:30] menacingtrees: i helped!

[0:42:55] Gamerhcp: random question for chat - do you have sound for typing enabled in your phone
[0:42:59] Rhop: Guys he gotta buy on Amazon to please daddy Bezos. This is a Twitch.
[0:43:04] Stormbeard: I use the Elgato Wave XLR, replacing my GOXLR with it, it's clean and easy and comes with a free digital mixer.
[0:43:06] Gamerhcp: like when you type shit do you hear the popping
[0:43:22] ralleralle: im a producer with several "endgame" equipment and just tuned in, what are u trying to acquire?
[0:43:30] Gamerhcp: i'm just curious what chat thinks
[0:43:39] scopeys112: @ralleralle his current setup has buzzing in the mic
[0:43:44] gruggee: absolutely hate button noise on phone
[0:43:45] turboer: hi just joined, is the drawing one of those psychopath tests ?
[0:43:50] toique: I think you need one from a company meant for streamers like elgato rather than producer grade equipment
[0:43:51] Rhop: It's probably just some special color or some shit
[0:43:56] Aeton88: pennys
[0:43:57] TirrinWoW: probably has a vintage preamp setting or something
[0:43:58] menacingtrees: its definitely overkill but while be nice
[0:44:05] Gamerhcp: YEP
[0:44:10] me_diocr3: yo max quit jebaiting us and get that gargantuous glizzy in some awc games
[0:44:11] alkanphell: @ralleralle seems his old audiointerface has some interference in mic sound so he wants new interface only this one is overkill : )
[0:44:13] jesuslouise: "one of those" we all take now and then
[0:44:19] HeffaBear: Mind your P's and Q's

[0:57:14] niddociv: Are there any tax benefits that youll get for giving that much of a down payment? @Maximum
[0:57:18] thatlittlegaming: you own the house, but the house has a lien on it.

[0:58:06] chimneybob: lower interest rate
[0:58:08] vohtoi: isn't that just called a mortgage?
[0:58:11] adardrae: you have to pay less interest on the loan
[0:58:25] Kripttyk: in Australia, if yoiu have less than 20 % deposit, you end up having to pay Lenders Mortgage insurance which ends up adding a substantial amount to the loan the less you have'

[1:01:06] jesuslouise: (it's really good) lol
[1:01:20] Linaka227: I'm the same way, just invest it.  Don't lose too much.  I never check it.  That would drive you crazy when you are investing in the market.
[1:01:23] ChuckBorrisSVK: We need to cut some of his tax pay so he has to bump the youtube numbers
[1:01:26] EFFSIN: leak it drizzyh
[1:01:32] alkanphell: tbh @Maximum i hope u trust him,most ppl get naild by others. Keep eye on ur own money too
[1:01:34] corebitz: Its fair, you dont have to worry about the quality of the product, because he makes sure it is his best every time

[1:09:30] HealsAndThat: @Archerone Wait you have different HZ in the us of A?
[1:09:34] ChuckBorrisSVK: Just buy two of them
[1:09:35] alkanphell: @Maximum i could build faraday cage : )
[1:09:40] DukeRollo_: too much draw, I'd get two then @Maximum  and use different wall outlets
[1:09:47] poroyou: Max check to make sure how many of them are surge protecting
[1:09:48] RemyLeBeau2: Moments like this confirm that I do not watch too much twitch. I really can't notice this static issue like the rest of chat here.
[1:09:50] Xyletics: 900W is low if you're plugging in your PCs to it
[1:09:55] poroyou: on mine only half of them
[1:09:56] HealsAndThat: Oh my god......
[1:09:57] lazy_marathoner: 60hz
[1:10:03] Squats3: its right there
[1:10:05] fronkacean: @RemyLeBeau2 when he holds his microphone it grounds the mic, so theres no static

[1:10:06] Squats3: under outlets
[1:10:13] Squats3: its 6 surge 6 powered backup
[1:10:18] chimneybob: they are cheaper on amazon

[1:10:26] chimneybob: same brand
[1:10:27] Shannso: chat is not where you should do this
[1:10:30] rangermonk: Is there a commercial grade?

[1:11:20] hauswas: I got an amazon gift card recently, what's the most value for buck product I should buy?
[1:11:20] travakal: I was just talking with Jak about these a couple weeks ago
[1:11:29] HealsAndThat: I gotta be honest, I've never felt so dumb from a freaking Twitch chat. This entire topic goes above my paygrade LUL
[1:11:35] littlebluechair: dorki max bought an apollo twin x earlier :)
[1:11:38] kalebmtv: Work for college football team, we use APC to keep power running in offices. Rack mounted as well as the desktop series
[1:11:45] Nikeisha: That's only 900w
[1:11:49] Lars_Keizer: They all look so sad Sadge D : \
[1:11:51] DukeRollo_: If you need more than 12 devices plugged in, you should get two units
[1:11:51] Gamerhcp: and pc
[1:11:58] mfalc: get two
[1:12:06] Themselves: Yeah at least 1500w
[1:12:07] Moaklerqt: That CP1500 is plenty for what you need. I would just recommend getting 2
[1:12:09] fzybny: APC 3000VA Smart UPS with SmartConnect, SMT3000C Sinewave UPS Battery Backup, AVR, 120V, Line Interactive Uninterruptible Power Supply
[1:12:10] Themselves: If you want one
[1:12:13] thatlittlegaming: 2200 VA is going to be the biggest you want to plug into a regular 110 socket
[1:12:17] poroyou: different outlets too
[1:12:20] Gamerhcp: a juicer
[1:12:21] RemyLeBeau2: That looks sexy. I would frame it
[1:12:24] glitsmonk: twice as big
[1:12:26] glitsmonk: and then two of those
[1:12:27] mrduckytom: nah multiple outlets is better
[1:12:28] CalaFPS: D: NA
[1:12:30] glitsmonk: just in case
[1:12:32] thatlittlegaming: Once you go above that you need a 220 volt socket
[1:12:33] Squats3: depends on the price. tends to scale exponentially
[1:12:36] Alucian: at some point you just need a generator lol
[1:12:37] EFFSIN: U want a drizzy glizzy one then
[1:12:39] alkanphell: best stream now
[1:12:40] Moaklerqt: No, those are exponentially pricier and for enterprise. Buy 2
[1:12:50] blacklight_____: getting 2 for multiple outlets is a lot safer and way cheaper
[1:12:51] Dzor12: Don't forget about monitors also
[1:12:59] DukeRollo_: You're moving into the server rack type UPS units if that's the case @Maximum - They dont really make standups much bigger than this anymore
[1:13:02] logain_13: I would think you'd want 2 if you're plugging 2 pcs into it
[1:13:02] payloon: just buy 2
[1:13:03] the_bhagwan: plug two of them into one of them 5Head
[1:13:08] EFFSIN: u dont need a UPS
[1:13:21] Xyletics: @DukeRollo_ not to mention different socket types too
[1:13:24] Moaklerqt: its dogshit pricing, its exactly. youre looking at multiple thousands of dollars
[1:13:25] poroyou: Do you got two different outlets?
[1:13:25] Spritesgud: You can plug a surgey P into one
[1:13:26] downbeatx: I sent it to you in discord
[1:13:28] travakal: was I misinformed that an Eaton 5s1500lcd is ideal?
[1:13:32] Benjg7: can’t you write all this off on your taxes as a business expense anyway?
[1:13:40] controlroom_caleb: D:
[1:13:41] Spinerek: HACKED
[1:13:48] xxunklekarlxx: just make sure to not plug both of them into the same outlet
[1:13:49] thenateo2: -1200 LUL
[1:13:50] controlroom_caleb: ip logged and frogged
[1:13:52] Mazmerized: HACKERMANS
[1:13:55] RoboMaximillion: doxxed
[1:13:55] downbeatx: look in discord
[1:13:58] NupidstoobTV: incognito
[1:14:00] DukeRollo_: EU brands have the weird sockets @Xyletics - Anything from the US should be fine, just have to double-check voltage
[1:14:05] ramzie0: Open in incognito
[1:14:07] Gamerhcp: incognito
[1:14:18] Vordie: A UPS won't do anything for your issue BTW but it's still a good buy to have.
[1:14:23] oresties: just open amazon incognito
[1:14:28] ewevix: ye incognito so you dont get auto complete
[1:14:29] brewticus: me too
[1:14:29] HealsAndThat: LUL

[1:14:40] mr_jimbone: LUL
[1:14:40] baccaras: this is the one
[1:14:41] MVPBuster: AINTNOWAY
[1:14:44] Thatguy8795: brooo
[1:14:45] BigBadAzz1: They will always see your proximate location
[1:14:47] levitucuss: monkaS
[1:14:49] Squats3: whole ass zipcode
[1:14:54] Themselves: Yeah that one. I use that but rack mounted for servers @maximum
[1:14:57] blacklight_____: @BigBadAzz1 he's in LA
[1:14:57] Themselves: Big recommend
[1:14:58] WoWEnder: im going to do weird shit
[1:14:58] vellic4: monkaS
[1:15:01] poroyou: literally less outlets
[1:15:04] alkanphell: here in EU we dont have these problems ; )
[1:15:04] WoWEnder: what is your full address?
[1:15:09] BLACKFOOT_TN: I will travel ALL of Nashville till I find you.
[1:15:14] Squats3: 1990w holy
[1:15:16] RoboMaximillion: UPS is always a smart investment
[1:15:18] Empirics_: 1980W
[1:15:32] Vordie: You can just connect a power strip to it Max.
[1:15:33] Grillelise: are you connected to a vpn?
[1:15:36] thatlittlegaming: Did you click on my link? Since I am close to nashville
[1:15:43] vohtoi: @Maximum you plug an extension off of that as long as its compliant
[1:15:46] Themselves: Yeah don't do that
[1:15:49] Squats3: yeah dont do that
[1:15:49] Spritesgud: you can plug a surge protector into a UPS. It's not "advised", but I've done it for years
[1:15:49] Thdlock: i use a ups
[1:15:50] Xyletics: @DukeRollo_ I'm referring to power coming in - rack mounted UPS quickly start looking for NEMA sockets at certain capacities
[1:15:51] Thdlock: very good
[1:15:51] RoboMaximillion: 4 for battery 4 that aren’t
[1:15:54] Empirics_: This is a surge protector dont do that
[1:15:56] Gamerhcp: WideTHD
[1:15:58] Spritesgud: a UPS is a big battery that saves your devices from power surges
[1:16:02] MVPBuster: WideTHD
[1:16:18] Spinerek: do you need 4 monitors plugged into a ups
[1:16:20] the_bhagwan: @Thdlock go live crank some aff keys Kappa
[1:16:24] RoboMaximillion: yeah you’d need two
[1:16:29] vohtoi: @Maximum you don't really want a UPS and power strip to be the same thing - you can but this product is better with a surge protected and compliant extension
[1:16:30] the_bhagwan: Passion
[1:16:30] alkanphell: u ould run interface with PC power
[1:16:31] BigBadAzz1: @blacklight_____ I think if they click on the link it will always show your proximate location.. Not the link from the recommendator in this cas3
[1:16:40] Moaklerqt: Just buy 2 CP1500's
[1:16:40] zannuss: No
[1:16:41] Squats3: @Maximum no its to save important stuff so you can turn it off
[1:16:45] Xercin: it's there just to turn it off safely
[1:16:45] RoboMaximillion: you want to hook up the essentials
[1:16:47] BreezyWinter: no, the point is that you have power to save shit and turn it off
[1:16:47] brewticus: you'd last like 30min max
[1:16:47] Xercin: won't keep it on for long
[1:16:52] Snoochey: 4 monitor gonna drain those batteries fast though
[1:16:52] zannuss: It's so you can save in progress work and shut down safely
[1:16:53] Shannso: yeah but this thing will only last like 2 minutes with your setup
[1:16:54] ACrustacean: the battery only lasts a couple of minutes
[1:16:55] RoboMaximillion: not everything
[1:16:57] the_bhagwan: buy a GENERATOR
[1:16:59] the_bhagwan: Pog
[1:17:00] Vordie: He's into consumerism mode today
[1:17:01] SerasVallo: the purpose is so you can turn your devices off rather than them crashing
[1:17:04] ACrustacean: it's just meant to power down safely
[1:17:04] j_hooligan: your router needs one as well if you still want internet when power goes out
[1:17:04] Spritesgud: 2 ups might draw too much from one outlet lol
[1:17:06] Thdlock: u wont last forever but literally anytime the power flickers u dont get fucked
[1:17:07] Whetss: Wish there was something like that for internet when it goes out briefly
[1:17:08] Gamerhcp: buy your own power plant
[1:17:09] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[1:17:10] logain_13: Can you get surge protectors that do electrical conditioning too?
[1:17:10] bubbles9001: yeah just get a back up generator for the stream
[1:17:12] lithobraking: Look at the times. It can only stay up for 2-3 min. It's for saving your files before the power dies
[1:17:14] mentoku: surely this will solve everything anniesCopium
[1:17:16] vigsta04: Thats going to last less than 10 minutes, lol
[1:17:16] panta_xdd: wow
[1:17:16] MisterNioce: @Max, Im an rf/eletrical Technician just tuning in. Whats the entire issue?
[1:17:18] Vordie: You just literally made 60 dollars!
[1:17:19] ChuckBorrisSVK: @Maximum It only runs minutes unless you hook it up to a fat battery pack
[1:17:20] levitucuss: free delivery to nashville - nice
[1:17:21] the_bhagwan: SOLD
[1:17:21] AoPsyke: @Spritesgud well yeah,m you plug em to two different outlets
[1:17:23] alkanphell: generator is next thing u should get and build faraday cage : )
[1:17:27] taibox: check to see how long you got on battery, usually its not very long
[1:17:27] skippy1132: Just install a power wall Keepo
[1:17:29] josh_is_chillin: WOWZERZ!
[1:17:30] Empirics_: That will not work, its only enough power to last like 10 min or something
[1:17:34] xxunklekarlxx: yeah you need like a home generator or something to stream for more than like 30 minutes without power
[1:17:37] dorki: get a new mic too
[1:17:38] Spritesgud: @AoPsyke he said he doesn't have 2 outlets XD
[1:17:44] jarmotron: you should look into solar panels since you usually just stream during the day Kappa
[1:17:46] BreezyWinter: MisterNioce he's just looking for a UPS solution for his whole setup
[1:17:49] Vordie: Fixed all your problems AND you MADE 60 dollars that's crazy
[1:17:53] mentoku: @dorki done been got

[1:17:59] fronkacean: @dorki poddyc with crackle would go crazy
[1:18:01] dorki: whatd he get
[1:18:05] taibox: usually gives you enough time to save things and shut down
[1:18:15] jarmotron: what didn't he get
[1:18:34] Themselves: This is Def not solving all your problems so have fun with chat trying to tech support for you

[1:21:51] Durenas: classic's difficulty is always in the math
[1:21:51] evac: can confirm, classic is harder than retail
[1:21:52] Theliahh: retail players Madge
[1:21:52] Themselves: Dorki thinks classic is harder
[1:21:54] Vordie: It's probably cause for the past 15 years before classic was released we had to hear about it 24/7 :P
[1:21:59] BLACKFOOT_TN: Why do you THINK? Because classic monkeys always shit on retail. Of course retail will shit on classic.
[1:22:01] aurochz: KEKW
[1:22:02] grobb12: cuz classic Stan’s were insufferable about that before classic released
[1:22:11] Empirics_: Classic is harder to level but thats it
[1:22:13] dodosuke: they're delusional
[1:22:20] AoPsyke: classic is constantly pointing dumb shit like that, and retail are constantly pointing dumb shit like that. so asinine
[1:22:21] nanerpus_: Kungen
[1:22:26] vohtoi: people just like to say things
[1:22:33] Jumanjiqt: there are genuine people who think SoD is harder than M+
[1:22:35] Azikielboi: i mean they will gish gallop and say nothing in retail is hard until week 1 mythic raiding @Maximum
[1:22:40] malavander: There's a reason their world firsts fall over
[1:22:40] Azikielboi: a lot of clowns will at leaset
[1:22:41] dodosuke: legit my friend calls the game hard because of its grinding/leveling/economy struggles
[1:22:43] oneifbyland: @Jumanjiqt ah yes, arguing vs. people who are delusional such a good use of time 5Head
[1:22:46] alkanphell: true
[1:22:47] mrduckytom: well staying awake in classic defenetly is harder
[1:22:47] aurochz: last guy is molten core is harder than smolderon and is his daddy
[1:22:48] nilleman1: truee
[1:22:49] fowltyy: theres legit nothing as hard as gnarlroot in classic
[1:22:52] bignoooodle: what about HC no damage run
[1:22:52] grobb12: on heroic
[1:22:57] Theliahh: you didnt have to kick tindral so this boss is harder
[1:22:58] Vordie: I can't, I'm twitter brained
[1:22:58] Xyletics: @Empirics_ it's not "harder" - it's just slower.
[1:23:00] CladeusXE: i think they mean bak in the day with shitty pc's
[1:23:04] Skydanzer: Gnarlroot has more complexity than classic bosses, but it is what ti s ;d
[1:23:06] nanerpus_: speedrunning still involves skill
[1:23:09] Jumanjiqt: Both is fun at the end of the day
[1:23:13] darkgigaz: You talking today or for the time
[1:23:15] dubbyatt: just gamers gaming
[1:23:34] Theliahh: the wrath guys were blastin
[1:23:39] alkanphell: we did this in 2005
[1:23:48] lolwhateverdog: phase 3 poison part has a gas that does deadly dot dmg they didnt interupt for like an hour
[1:23:53] Tehqq_: Its like speedruns
[1:23:57] Empirics_: @Xyletics That makes it harder for me because 2 days in I want to quit because I should be max level already....lol
[1:23:59] Tehqq_: Very fun to watch
[1:24:06] vohtoi: you think you do, but you don't
[1:24:07] Themselves: LuvSnooze
[1:24:09] johnnyblingxz: Lich King heroic without buff is probably harder than gnarlroot tbh
[1:24:13] grimzero617: How does lock tank even work?
[1:24:22] Xyletics: @Empirics_ lmao, that is totally fair
[1:24:23] bignoooodle: guys he said the thing
[1:24:25] AHart101: any liquid boys speeed run on sod or classic?
[1:24:27] Durenas: i remember 8 hour molten core runs back in vanilla
[1:24:30] Jazzarus_: thoughts on the jdotb tweet about key depletion?
[1:24:36] lolwhateverdog: yeah they won on leveling. raid comp is 5 mages lol its literally just 2 dungeon groups combined
[1:24:41] Lars_Keizer: And they had fun. No nerd-scream though Sadge
[1:24:54] nanerpus_: no, its just supposed to be fun
[1:24:56] wyndi66: classic is a vibe.
[1:24:57] dorki: they could easily make it challenging if they wanted
[1:25:00] Syrjyys: @grimzero617 Mix of blood dk and bear
[1:25:01] Squats3: do not tell classic players they think they want something, but they dont
[1:25:07] oneifbyland: yea it's not for difficulty, it's to provide additional content
[1:25:08] panser_nes: its like a normal raid in retail it feels like
[1:25:23] logain_13: Yeah, players can make it harder for themselves, like 5 manning it
[1:25:27] CladeusXE: testing new ideas also
[1:25:30] Squats3: wowhead tries their hardest to ruin everything
[1:25:32] Theliahh: no it's good
[1:25:35] Squats3: nah
[1:25:39] nanerpus_: nah
[1:25:41] Durenas: yeah i wasn't feeling level 25, and i'm pretty much not feeling 40
[1:25:41] JoaEUW: @Maximum people love alting it, i dont think it matters if they extend
[1:25:42] nanerpus_: its perfect
[1:25:43] Azikielboi: agree with u and i played it a lot @Maximum
[1:25:44] Jumanjiqt: They're trying to cater to the very casual players
[1:25:45] bignoooodle: you think you want fun but you actually want to go n reddit and complain
[1:25:45] Squats3: its giving people more time to level and still do the content
[1:25:46] Azikielboi: but others disagree
[1:25:47] nanerpus_: adn there is a 3 day reset for raids
[1:25:48] Jazzarus_: takes long to level and people dont play that much each day
[1:25:51] Woberg: id have liked an inbetween pahse where we got a 2nd lvl 20 raid
[1:25:51] nanerpus_: so its really fun
[1:25:55] itsumbreonn: for me i didnt play the last 2 weeks because i had finished everything but i put a lot of time
[1:25:56] HansGuckIndLuft: It's like Diablo seasons for me
[1:25:57] bubbles9001: my problem with SOD is the parcing community
[1:25:57] alkanphell: im waching for few mins and bored lol
[1:25:58] TyHeals: It's a great time sink when we are waiting for season 4
[1:26:09] oneifbyland: that's only because the people you "see" (streamers, youtubers) all rush to max-level. for casual SoD players the pace is fine
[1:26:09] Azikielboi: i think its pretty 50/50
[1:26:11] cursedcr0wn: i feel its going to be a long time before next phase now, 40 to 50
[1:26:11] HeffaBear: they already announced delays on cata classic, pretty sure everythings behind at this point
[1:26:17] Lorven_: target audience? BOOMERS
[1:26:20] alkanphell: is there any news for season 4?
[1:26:28] duskyv: how much longer til s4

[1:26:59] lukinss: sod is the most fun ive had with any version of wow in a long time
[1:26:59] Durenas: raid lockouts kind of don't work as a comparison to diablo
[1:27:05] Tehqq_: @BigSatchel Less than 2 weeks!
[1:27:08] itsgamz: every game should be seasonal
[1:27:18] alarkin: you can craft uber uniques in D4 now, they just implemented that today
[1:27:21] Vordie: I honestly love the no-PTR thing for lore related patches
[1:27:22] Theliahh: can you guess a date for season 4
[1:27:26] sir_jaaahrl_gaming: intresting its 5 mages an no more rogs / warriorsa
[1:27:26] lolwhateverdog: poison phase 3
[1:27:28] MisterNioce: My guilds stressing about getting CE in time. Any guess when the next season starts?
[1:27:28] friday_exe: I swapped to SoD from retail cus I want to relax my brain, and I got pissed that one kick can ruin a m+ run. I am jsut done
[1:27:28] ewevix: green cast

[1:27:39] Jazzarus_: hope they try with no depleting keys in s4
[1:27:45] darkgigaz: Hoping for weekly war within trees moving forward
[1:27:57] jvmes_r6: god classic gameplay sucks
[1:27:58] Jazzarus_: LUL
[1:28:14] YourEvilTwin666: i mean it doesnt even have a castbar so it makes sense
[1:28:17] logain_13: Yeah, there's no cast indicator
[1:28:22] alkanphell: any hope for ww in new expension
[1:28:28] dubbyatt: wow scrolling battle text op
[1:28:28] lolwhateverdog: they won by 9 minutes lol
[1:28:32] gole_gogole: Hey i just bought WoW, i have a level 70 with a decent ilvl... i dont want to do 10 year old dungs in different diffulcties all day long... is there any content i can do except collecting girly mounts, waiting in pvp queu for 50 min , or do the gilneas questline that only takes 5 minutes?
[1:28:43] thenateo2: an hour
[1:28:43] Rootballa: like 50
[1:28:45] BigluWoW: 10 times
[1:28:45] Theliahh: it was like an hour

[1:28:46] yama_class: an hour worth of wipes
[1:28:46] Hugosuave: an hour
[1:28:47] adardrae: 11 total wipes or something
[1:28:48] Emiltharia: They had 10 wipes

[1:28:48] DiegoDiazcs: an hour
[1:28:53] Xandid: 11 I think

[1:28:55] sir_jaaahrl_gaming: kekw
[1:29:04] lophtxd: i mean theres no cash bar
[1:29:04] bubbles9001: i try to kick everything
[1:29:05] lophtxd: cast*
[1:29:07] Nyurro: No flame but how do you not just try kicking it after the first couple of times
[1:29:08] bubbles9001: and see what happens
[1:29:11] Durenas: cast bars weren't a thing originally in vanilla
[1:29:11] StanRaenslen: they like tried LoS etc
[1:29:14] AoPsyke: @sir_jaaahrl_gaming it didn'T show as interruptible
[1:29:22] Zimmerh: Afaik they thought they had tried to kick it
[1:29:26] thenateo2: thats a first surely
[1:29:26] sir_jaaahrl_gaming: doesnt matter its classic
[1:29:26] Critmaw: I don't think so
[1:29:27] Theliahh: there are VERY few kickable bosses in classic
[1:29:30] adardrae: there's much more hidden information in classic and especially SOD
[1:29:47] lophtxd: no cast bar = you wouldnt think to kick, right?
[1:29:51] Durenas: cast bars were added later in vanilla
[1:29:57] Rootballa: to be fair, it is very obviously channelling
[1:29:57] Themselves: Chatters would've killed it an hour faster if they actually cared about it LUL
[1:30:01] eggs_boiled: this SoD gameplay looks pretty boring to me
[1:30:05] grobb12: you used to need an addon to see cast bars not sure if they swapped that
[1:30:06] Themselves: Classic
[1:30:07] samaxis: There are no cast bars in base classic all cast bars were add ons?
[1:30:09] Moai: u dont even talent kick most of the times

[1:30:24] Novalazar: What would be your best bet for the new expansion (retail)? @Maximum
[1:30:36] otrew: they were also playing for like 14 hpurs
[1:30:36] Lars_Keizer: Are you considering playing some Ashes of Creation once (if) it releases?
[1:30:38] Squats3: we need truck sim again @Maximum

[1:35:50] SkunkTruck: ya its great
[1:35:56] Vordie: Last episode was SO disappoing
[1:36:02] EFFSIN: What does the promote thing mean @Maximum
[1:36:05] Lorven_: i can see why ur 2nd tweet was triggering though, book Foundation is literally GOATed
[1:36:06] JansonLives: @Maximum I just watched the first two eps of Foundation and i'm really liking it so far
[1:36:17] Benjg7: oh I started watching this on your recommendation
[1:36:24] Benjg7: Finished both seasons in a week

[1:37:17] Joneim: Class A Weirdo?
[1:37:18] chimneybob: expanse is a good show. rare for a scifi space show to get as many season as expanse did.
[1:37:19] TzatzikiBalls: In his defense "the expanse" is fucking spectacular
[1:37:25] menzlo: bot?
[1:37:28] Squats3: @Maximum hes a hate watcher but on twitter. thats almost worse
[1:37:36] HeffaBear: dude making me nervous with those confident scrolls
[1:37:45] Madgeneto: replying to himself GIGACHAD
[1:37:46] Vordie: Hopefully he's getting paid for this
[1:37:46] Mazmerized: Ok expanse is good but holy is this guy sponsored
[1:37:47] BLACKFOOT_TN: THAT guy.
[1:37:49] Squats3: wait what did yo usay yep to

[1:37:57] CoconutJP: WeirdChamp
[1:37:57] Durenas: grade a expanse simp
[1:37:57] WrathofBambi: Is this astroturfing or stanning ?
[1:37:59] ColdIceCreamMan: @jetstreamsamn7 i loved the first season, but with season 3 it went downhill
[1:38:01] grimzero617: He's got stock in The Expanse
[1:38:02] riddlerboy: The man's not wrong though
[1:38:06] mau5_mask: I wish I was that dedicated to something in my life
[1:38:07] Neomagam: are we sure that isn't an AI?

[1:38:12] Joneim: Legendary Sellout status
[1:38:12] Pyrrha_GG: thats like chatters who ask their question 8 times in a row
[1:38:15] Durenas: expanse IS good
[1:38:18] Hugosuave: wait so am i gonna watch the expanse now
[1:38:18] JackOfAllApocalypses: sure, crazy...but have you watched the expanse though?
[1:38:24] DaddyTwoTime: Plot twist: He's a writer for The Expanse
[1:38:24] Vordie: I liked ep 7 ending, I did NOT like ep8.
[1:38:24] Azikielboi: @Maximum okay u mock him, but dont u wish u loved soemthing as much as he loves the expanse?
[1:38:26] ooreallynow: ooreallynow subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! MAX I love you!
[1:38:26] JansonLives: that dude is the kid of a producer on the Expanse. trying to fatten up his inheritance
[1:38:27] ratgefingah: @Hugosuave yis
[1:38:32] mentoku: The Expanse is definitely good, but no one should be that guy
[1:38:36] bigmeanbeefy: the comments he is answering is removed maybe?
[1:38:37] menacingtrees: BROOO
[1:38:38] WrathofBambi: That guy won
[1:38:40] Theliahh: you can't let him win
[1:38:41] menacingtrees: THE EXPANSE IS GOATED
[1:38:42] Stubblelad: Expanse is very good
[1:38:43] GrimGreyBeard: L Amos? Even if Amos was a loser he wouldn't be like that
[1:38:43] DodogZ: The Expanse owns
[1:38:43] honeychonker: The Expanse is very good, the first few seasons especially
[1:38:43] Lorven_: the expanse is great
[1:38:44] Nifflies: it good
[1:38:46] OG_Kawngi: they got him
[1:38:46] menacingtrees: NAHH THE EXPANSE IS BASED
[1:38:47] el_vegee: the Expanse is a good show
[1:38:47] Jazzarus_: You'll go into it wanting to hate it LUL
[1:38:48] maaamas: he's in your head
[1:38:49] CladeusXE: its pretty good
[1:38:51] mcfireCH: the expanse is awesome
[1:38:52] Zeitgeist9000: The SyFy seasons are amazing, the amazon ones are mid
[1:38:52] Theliahh: D:
[1:38:54] DaddyTwoTime: Honestly this dude definitely has some shit in TE
[1:38:54] eggs_boiled: BASED
[1:38:56] chimneybob: Books are great too
[1:38:58] PJs_Banana: The expanse is great, but it takes a few episodes
[1:38:59] yawgmothsupp: Its ok
[1:38:59] MaeunGochu: it's slow at first
[1:38:59] menacingtrees: expanse is goat supreme
[1:39:03] emarol_dk: 2 episodes and i thought the same
[1:39:04] spinachdipminiatures: @Maximum sci-fi is great an all but we are really missing the actual club banger... Farmer Wants A Wife
[1:39:05] mcfireCH: just get over the first 2-3 episodes and you'll get sucked in
[1:39:07] samaxis: Foundation season 1 is really good. Season 2 was solid but felt a bit forced and not meh
[1:39:08] wisebighorn: the Expanse is a good show, if you are into Sci-Fi. Foundation is great too dont make me into that guy
[1:39:13] WrathofBambi: The expanse is great but start is slow
[1:39:19] PeziBear_: you should try to watch High School D×D
[1:39:20] poroyou: is that the one where people cant stand up in regular gravity any more
[1:39:20] honeychonker: It's loosely based in the same universe as The Martian
[1:39:22] TsvDorn: the xpanse sometimes looks super cheap. compared to foundation it definitly stinks
[1:39:22] jesuslouise: imdb is accurate for me 99% of the time
[1:39:23] poroyou: like wall-e
[1:39:27] menacingtrees: expanse is NO BEAKED
[1:39:35] Jazzarus_: @menacingtrees LUL
[1:39:37] DaddyTwoTime: Why we watching sci-fi when we could be watching Peppa Pig?????
[1:39:39] Yowakeem: Reacher is underrated, would say its a good filler series
[1:39:41] Vordie: Eh I dont wanna have to sit through 2 bad seasons to get to the good part
[1:39:44] othernewname: imdb is just filled with fanboys
[1:39:45] alarkin: The genetic dynasty is one of the most compelling sci-fi stories I've encountered for real though
[1:39:48] Joneim: 99% of gamblers quite before they hit big
[1:39:48] PJs_Banana: You should ask that guy if he has a Roci tattoo?
[1:39:48] darhaja_: the first season of true detective was insanely good
[1:39:53] alkanphell: reacher is rly good imo
[1:40:08] 5murfThis: @maximum Rotten tomatoes works good for comedies. Where its not a high quality movie, but its super entertaining.
[1:40:10] Castsequence: The 100 is a good show :)
[1:40:24] CoffeeASAP: it was probably my comment EZ
[1:40:35] Theliahh: I think they should buff all specs
[1:40:37] business_man_alex: 100% my comment
[1:40:49] alkanphell: nerfing is less work
[1:40:56] Lorven_: @Castsequence the 100 is godawful please dont
[1:41:11] CladeusXE: bfa pvp scaling LUL
[1:41:38] OG_Kawngi: buff specs I play, nerf the ones I don't
[1:41:48] dorki: destro lock best example
[1:41:49] Rocklenry: Look at the info for Rogues. If you don't dive the discord there's little rogue info until this season
[1:41:52] juddrybmmbytddcc: Hey i just bought WoW, i have a level 70 with a decent ilvl... i dont want to do 10 year old dungs in different diffulcties all day long... is there any content i can do except collecting girly mounts, waiting in pvp queu for 50 min , or do the gilneas questline that only takes 5 minutes? @maximum
[1:41:55] dorki: no1 knows how good destro actually is
[1:42:10] Theliahh: thd knows
[1:42:12] Jazzarus_: @dorki preach, brother
[1:42:14] th3b0bby: ret paladin is crazy right now it needs a nerf
[1:42:16] Lorven_: you just missed it
[1:42:17] Lorven_: i think
[1:42:22] Theliahh: WideTHD
[1:42:25] Madgeneto: @dorki is that a bit?
[1:42:33] Jazzarus_: ctrl+F
[1:42:34] dorki: no y would it be
[1:42:36] Lorven_: 90% sure it was up there
[1:42:39] Joneim: Oh yeah, imagine anyone bringing a Survival or Enhance shaman in Season 1 Shadowlands, nobody had any idea
[1:42:42] business_man_alex: @Madgeneto nah destro is unironically op
[1:42:50] juddrybmmbytddcc: @maximum please answer my question i sacrificed alot for my subcription
[1:42:57] Lorven_: there was a guy who was starting to talk about blizz balance and data
[1:43:00] oneifbyland: @juddrybmmbytddcc is this your alt account? someone posted this earlier trying to get ppl to copy-pasta and it got zero attention LUL 2nd time's the charm?
[1:43:05] Lorven_: thats what i was able to read til u scrolled
[1:43:06] poroyou: he-kili
[1:43:09] grimzero617: Heckely?
[1:43:19] nanerpus_: its great, i more use it to have an easy eye on what cooldowns i can queue up
[1:43:19] Theliahh: I just dont want to stare at it all the time
[1:43:23] reggiepowa: you can set it up to just remind you to press cooldowns
[1:43:30] jesuslouise: trusting chat PepeLaugh
[1:43:31] Lorven_: on god i saw it
[1:43:41] business_man_alex: Helkiki is amazing to use alongside the cd tracker thing on the side of your screen. You record your pulls and look at where your CD usage differs from optimal cds
[1:43:46] business_man_alex: thats how i use it
[1:43:48] juddrybmmbytddcc: Hey i just bought WoW, i have a level 70 with a decent ilvl... i dont want to do 10 year old dungs in different diffulcties all day long... is there any content i can do except collecting girly mounts, waiting in pvp queu for 50 min , or do the gilneas questline that only takes 5 minutes? @maximum
[1:43:49] Snoochey: It's like a music meter, even if you don't NEED it using it, it helps keep you on track
[1:43:51] fat_european0: The anticipation is killing me
[1:43:56] Lorven_: yeah thats the one
[1:44:05] Lorven_: damniut
[1:44:05] Jazzarus_: LUL
[1:44:06] 5murfThis: Almost +
[1:44:14] Lorven_: thats the one i saw my b
[1:44:17] eggs_boiled: @Rizzalicious_ does it do that by default?
[1:44:17] Pyrrha_GG: max is was listening to your vod on the hero talents, and you seemed to rail against the power of the priest oracle tree, but you had seemed to be pretty against that line of thinking for the other trees. Was this just an additional reaction to not liking the design of the tree or did it just seem especially weak to you
[1:44:18] UnlimitedBytes: @Ruti528 10 days ago
[1:44:19] WrathofBambi: On the topic of "why nerf, why not just buff," a huge point that people never mention is the lack of information. If there are 4 specs that are way better than everything else, everyone plays those specs. There is plenty of data about what is good, exactly how good it is, and exactly what makes it good. If there are 10 specs that zero competitive players are playing, there is zero data on whether they are actually bad, how bad they are, and what makes them bad. Nerfing the overperformers allow
[1:44:28] business_man_alex: @eggs_boiled it's two WAs
[1:44:31] UnlimitedBytes: @Maximum It's from  @Ruti528
[1:44:36] business_man_alex: one is called streamer cd tracker or something like that
[1:44:40] business_man_alex: the other is Helkiki
[1:44:41] WrathofBambi: Looks like that's it
[1:44:47] business_man_alex: you stack them on top of one another
[1:44:57] Italicuss: youo'll need quotations if you want to ctrl f it
[1:44:59] Jazzarus_: scroll down a lot until you can ctrl+F it
[1:45:00] WrathofBambi: oh
[1:45:00] business_man_alex: it makes vod review sooooo much better
[1:45:03] Skydanzer: you gotta put a quotation in your search to find it I think
[1:45:07] UnlimitedBytes: "On the topic of "why nerf, why not just buff," a huge point that people never mention is the lack of information.

[1:45:10] WrathofBambi: Nerfing the overperformers allows you to do targeted balancing. Buffing underperformers is just taking shots in the dark.
[1:45:13] UnlimitedBytes: Nerfing the overperformers allows you to do targeted balancing. Buffing underperformers is just taking shots in the dark.
[1:45:46] Theliahh: I swear I heard xyro post that exact thing once
[1:45:51] Madgeneto: yea
[1:45:57] Madgeneto: makes sense
[1:46:00] Italicuss: based youtube comenter
[1:46:01] ratgefingah: vip them
[1:46:03] kryptisgg: 5head
[1:46:03] ratgefingah: Kappa
[1:46:03] svendrabbit: tbh its overcomplicated
[1:46:06] fat_european0: Very insightful
[1:46:08] Lorven_: thats Ion tbh
[1:46:10] dorki: it's a bit exaggerated
[1:46:14] eggs_boiled: Chadder
[1:46:14] TzatzikiBalls: I promise you that dude works with data analysis LUL
[1:46:15] svendrabbit: nerfing 4 is easier than buffing 32 is the only answer
[1:46:17] jerkmcgee: @UnlimitedBytes is the chosen one
[1:46:17] Jazzarus_: that's a tweet right there
[1:46:20] Pyrrha_GG: you dont know what you dont know
[1:46:21] litrlg0d: litrlg0d subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! I. love. you.
[1:46:23] Fackoz_: yoink that!
[1:46:25] Rocklenry: Dude is probably on the balance team at blizzard haha
[1:46:26] drewsky96: I think it's another good take, but to say that they have 0 info is defiinitely exaggerated
[1:46:33] Joneim: A real diamond in the rough
[1:46:39] Galarian_Hp: the thing about 0 competetive players is bs
[1:46:40] MorpheenBE: GIGACHAD
[1:46:43] CoffeeASAP: yoink
[1:46:43] Italicuss: ez W
[1:46:58] svendrabbit: bad players roll fotm as well
[1:46:59] poroyou: yea but in data n of X is important
[1:47:00] Lorven_: you familiar with known knowns, known unknowns, unknown knowns and unknown unknowns? pretty sure thats an application of that
[1:47:04] Theliahh: also buffing 30 specs because 1 is too good is now soft-nerfing all content which is silly
[1:47:07] UsedRuggs: Feral, Warriors ect..
[1:47:08] gouldinglol: if you buff 32 specs, the bosses just die in like 2 minutes
[1:47:09] oneifbyland: it's literally the reason why Blizzard always releases new specs and reworks (at least somewhat) overtuned. They want to encourage players to play the new stuff to gather data on it @Maximum
[1:47:13] headninja1ncharge: Like me and Survival
[1:47:14] Jazzarus_: the thing is Blizz probably only cares about the data for the whole playerbase and not only top players
[1:47:18] svendrabbit: you see this in league as well.. bad champions typically have higher winrate than they should.. because its only "main players"
[1:47:19] WrathofBambi: Poor ruti528, his best takes stolen by shameless streamer Sadge
[1:47:26] Rocklenry: There's also a difference between competitive players who stream/break down classes/etc and just people who play them at a high level and don't give anything to the community
[1:47:28] antipheonixna: i mean u just wont have certain players playing specs with certain ilvs, thats objective
[1:47:34] Lullitawar: True bue there is tons of data showing that warrior are less take in m+ weekly because of some affix and they still didnt do anything ( except this horrible 1.5min cd )
[1:47:39] Vordie: Poor Crit having to reroll firemage
[1:47:53] Rocklenry: when there's more competitive players you're more likely to get more involved competitive players in the community
[1:47:54] Theliahh: @dorki why doesnt the chat here copy and paste any message longer than a sentence like yours ?
[1:47:55] fat_european0: I feel like people started meta gaming a lot more after Blizzard added 0.1% title & in-game rating
[1:48:01] alarkin: I think you need to clearly define and boundary 'competitive' in this context. For instance, I would say anyone doing AoTC and +15s is doing competitive content, but I doubt you would, so clarity matters
[1:48:21] jerkmcgee: YEP
[1:48:24] UsedRuggs: Just Learn to Multi class and follow the meta
[1:48:29] TheunGaming: maevey finally moving off resto shaman IonJam
[1:48:30] el_brodor: big true, swapped of enh because it feels bad to find groups past 27's
[1:48:32] MaliciousDH: nerf rogue
[1:48:33] Onyo1337: Idk rerolling is so easy with the upgrade system and trying different speccs is actually fun
[1:48:36] Galarian_Hp: there are low pop specs with really good players, doing also well when those specs were meta in other seasons
[1:48:39] business_man_alex: competitive content is going at least to the last boss of the raid and doing +20s
[1:48:41] business_man_alex: imo
[1:48:43] Jumanjiqt: Yeah i agree. I love unholy dk but can barely get into 18s at 480 ilvl so I'm just levelling a mage now
[1:48:55] SirHorner: I had never played DH, but was forced to gear up one this season, due to my other char not getting invited to keys
[1:48:58] alarkin: So that
[1:49:00] litrlg0d: I’d rather play with someone good than some playing a meta spec
[1:49:11] alarkin: Isn't that like maybe a few thousand people that play?
[1:49:15] Empirics_: lol +15s and AOTC is not competitive imo
[1:49:17] fat_european0: @Maximum Isn't easier gearing part of that? Before you had to do a ton of random grinds to be competitive. Now you spend 1 week~ doing HC & m+ and you're close to caught up.
[1:49:18] MaliciousDH: so .01% of the wow population
[1:49:18] BigDaddyWeezz: what about healers
[1:49:19] Jabronie_808: Just play healer. Get invited ez
[1:49:27] m_g_power: @Maximum i switched to a meta dps class recently (sadge) and im heavily struggling to perform as good as before , any suggestion u might have ? :P
[1:49:30] Jazzarus_: I play off meta on purpose and it's fun
[1:49:35] kryptisgg: @litrlg0d You say that but before SP buffs I'd never want to play with a good SP over a average OP meta class lol
[1:49:39] xDevDev: @Jabronie_808 and then get flamed to hell KEKW
[1:49:48] SirHorner: @litrlg0d although you don't know if someone is good just by looking at them in queue, so you would gravitate towards meta specs probably - because if you're mediocre at both, as a meta spec you'll be more useful
[1:49:52] headninja1ncharge: I tried gearing my shadow priest and Ive never been rejected from groups faster in my life
[1:49:54] TyHeals: the largest disparity has to be tanks atm
[1:49:56] MisterNioce: I get shit constantly for playing Devastation Evoker... Yet do more damage and Parse better than most mythic raiders. Anythings possible
[1:49:56] Cunninglinguist1: unless your a druid the game is pretty balanced rn
[1:50:00] みょせつ: godcomp is back peepoHappy
[1:50:10] custom025: I got into a 29 as a WW!
[1:50:11] Emiltharia: I heard this take from a lot of people (That the patch is silenty in a good state) and while I totally agree with this in terms of output, I still think the desparity between different classes and specs utility is too massive.
[1:50:17] kryptisgg: @Cunninglinguist1 Just go resto (Not inr aid though rip) lol
[1:50:18] Brobi: Usually the cut off for non-meta classes is around 24, this season it's like 28-29s
[1:50:23] ph00lish: ive played with 17 specs this week in my pugs above +25's
[1:50:23] gwynne23: Right now it's pretty interesting, I'm playing a "B tier dps" and still pushing and seeing all odd specs
[1:50:25] greatangelsanguinius: not warriors

[1:50:30] eggs_boiled: windwalker mentioned GIGACHAD
[1:50:31] Airu91: UN HOLY ?
[1:50:31] LucasSterling_: meeres doing big dmg on his dk
[1:50:33] greatangelsanguinius: oh shock
[1:50:34] MaliciousDH: how many dev evokers
[1:50:36] Joneim: Aware
[1:50:37] Zarroe: i saw a surv hunter the other day it was crazy
[1:50:37] duplexity_dave: Warrior Sadge
[1:50:39] BobPlaysTheGames: Dev evokers?
[1:50:40] Onyo1337: @Cunninglinguist1 balance is pumping in keys lol
[1:50:40] alarkin: I think WoW needs like a fundamental reassessment of how it maps out competitive content for this reason, it just so clearly feels like it isn't designed for the vast majority of the people who play, and that just seems bizarre.
[1:50:44] drewsky96: nah warrior is actually kinda bad in m+
[1:50:44] Jazzarus_: People are always amazed after they see me killing it with Survival Hunter, they are alienated to think that it sucks
[1:50:45] volkov0309: You'll never get invited as a warrior
[1:50:48] rushy01: feral druid NOPE
[1:51:03] Fackoz_: 489 warr getting declined to 21s WICKED
[1:51:12] Emiltharia: I heard this take from a lot of people (That the patch is silenty in a good state) and while I totally agree with this in terms of output, I still think the desparity between different classes and specs utility is too massive.
[1:51:17] Clarius: Hpriest and Disc
[1:51:33] xli89: feral, affli, dev evoker, mm hunter
[1:52:04] Eugoog: They? You mean you nerfed dk
[1:52:20] SkunkTruck: agreed
[1:52:28] RayWoz: viable
[1:52:30] aostripe: Viable :O
[1:52:30] oneifbyland: "viable" YEP
[1:52:32] DeVocalize: hello max, first time i made it to a stream, im always watching yt     videos
[1:52:34] gouldinglol: zuggers
[1:52:35] reggiepowa: bringable Okayge
[1:52:37] Joneim: Dont think we've had to drop many melee at all for ages
[1:52:40] Jazzarus_: This is probably subjective, but melee is more fun to play than ranged
[1:52:41] jerkmcgee: yep
[1:52:48] Evandar21: tindral is the first boss where there even was a strict melee requirement that guilds had to meet afaik
[1:53:19] Onyo1337: @Evandar21 you could play around backups I think but gigacursed
[1:53:32] fat_european0: So what you're saying is that Blizz should rework Dev into another support spec?
[1:53:42] Emiltharia: I heard this take from a lot of people (That the patch is silenty in a good state) and while I totally agree with this in terms of output, I still think the desparity between different classes and specs utility is too massive.
[1:53:43] itsRMP: like surv vs bm, has to be turbo op
[1:53:53] SerasVallo: it was only like this last patch that feral gained the ability to cast innervate without being pulled out of cat form
[1:54:04] Tsylent: literally this raid was the first time they could cast innervate in cat form too lmao
[1:54:42] Onyo1337: no
[1:54:43] itsRMP: @Maximum how would it look if it was season 2 dev currently, or aug coming out beginnign of season 2
[1:54:44] Joneim: Not at all
[1:54:49] stonedboodah: my mouse is giving out. what mouse should i get??? any suggestions?
[1:54:50] MisterNioce: My guild doesn't
[1:54:53] honeychonker: Personal ye
[1:54:57] WowGrandma78: WowGrandma78 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Good afternoon Max and chat
[1:55:03] khebul: not a consideration at all
[1:55:04] UnheardGrace: wouldn't it be the same as mass barrier?
[1:55:04] Onyo1337: wowgrandma Pog
[1:55:05] honeychonker: @WowGrandma78 Hi grandma!
[1:55:07] GrimFandango: Hi @WowGrandma78 !
[1:55:13] Neomagam: All of our Augvokers quit because it was so awful to raid as
[1:55:14] TheunGaming: spatial paradox is mandatory for disc
[1:55:16] CasualDev: abomination for keys. Delete pls
[1:55:17] TheunGaming: on fyrakk
[1:55:22] changnesia6: yooo its WowGrandma!
[1:55:25] mentoku: becClass WowGrandma78
[1:55:34] Fibonacci_Jones: spatial felt huge at p3 fyrakk
[1:55:37] Emiltharia: I heard this take from a lot of people (That the patch is silenty in a good state) and while I totally agree with this in terms of output, I still think the desparity between different classes and specs utility is too massive.
[1:55:42] gouldinglol: just steal it & give it to ele
[1:55:48] moash_: P1 fyrakk ramping without spatial is hell
[1:55:50] Vordie: What do you do with Pres in that scenario
[1:55:51] drewsky96: then evoker starts running into the problem of "man, which insanely powerful button do I want from my class tree"
[1:55:54] Onyo1337: @Neomagam we only have 1 and he wants to reroll in fated, all of our augs hate it aswell
[1:56:08] bigmeanbeefy: warrior utility, kek
[1:56:23] Emiltharia: Fair point. It is also mainly a mythic+ thing I guess
[1:56:33] minglium: when was the last time that bear was the chosen tank for raid?
[1:56:48] Emiltharia: @minglium Prolly ToS?
[1:57:03] Lullitawar: @minglium Not that far ago , you're more take than a prot war :)
[1:57:26] Brobi: Did he just write 7 starting from the bottom and going up?
[1:57:35] jongineering: he did
[1:57:35] Lullitawar: @minglium Bear tank was the ULTIMATE oof tank in sod if i remember well
[1:57:37] WowGrandma78: he did
[1:57:42] jongineering: the madman
[1:58:05] alarkin: Is there a reason why that can't be the same in a raid?
[1:58:26] Trodenskjold: Can you please write 7 again Max
[1:58:44] Keppie__: Uncap int shout and reduce cd
[1:58:45] SkunkTruck: just give warrior battlefeild commander pvp talent and we are alot better
[1:58:51] SpeedyMcD: @maximum do you think some specs are unnecessarily harder to be decent at than others? an example would be like arcane mage vs a bm hunter
[1:59:01] fat_european0: Hunter is kinda the same, it just needs easy fixes. They should put the silence arrow in the class tree and revert binding shot nerf
[1:59:03] Jumanjiqt: Chat make him write 7 again
[1:59:10] CopeyJ: Warrior having bloodlust would make so much sense
[1:59:14] Keppie__: and remove all of those shitty dmg notes that give <1%
[1:59:18] Brobi: Lets focus on the important things. That 7 was insanity
[1:59:26] Harthad: warrior has ton of utility, you just have to spec into it all and then make no dmg
[1:59:26] Harleybane: spellreflect being partywide
[1:59:35] greatangelsanguinius: Warrior needs group def
[1:59:45] zukohonor: what if everyone had they same stuns ands defensives, like in FFXIV?
[1:59:47] Emiltharia: Good take tbh. As a DK main in general I do feel sort of hard done by in DF tbh. I think Frost and Unholy not having access to mass grip is so problematic and we havent had our rework yet so in that regard we are also just "behind"
[1:59:50] m_g_power: i want every class to have a certain and unique utility that works best in a specific fight , so all guilds have to change their comps in each boss fight <3
[1:59:53] fat_european0: There are too many defensives in general tbh
[2:00:35] Neomagam: @Emiltharia Here me out: they should remove the damage from Abom limb so it is purely utility
[2:00:45] needaccounttwitch: truuue
[2:00:50] honeychonker: But we are Wizards
[2:00:51] Joneim: Just give Barrier to Shamans PepeLaugh
[2:00:52] Harleybane: every class should just have 1 minor and 1 major personal
[2:00:56] sethron: less on offense imo
[2:00:58] conphusedtv: conphusedtv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[2:00:58] GrimFandango: Then we wouldn't haave a DR :(
[2:00:58] gouldinglol: mages have more defensives than bm has offensives
[2:00:59] Emiltharia: @Neomagam Bad take my dude. Abom as a grip is bad cause it isnt insta on all mobs
[2:01:02] Lullitawar: Even when mage are bad at start ( because they need stuff to be great ) they buff them so they are overpower at the end ><
[2:01:03] GrimFandango: Well I guess Greater Invis lol...
[2:01:04] antipheonixna: combine barrier and group barrier
[2:01:05] duskyv: mage police, get him
[2:01:06] cosmoshabitant: WRONG Madge
[2:01:09] demiralos: Maaaaaaaaaaaaah
[2:01:09] spivet: I started playing some mage after years as ele and it’s fucking ridiculous how many not die buttons mage has
[2:01:12] el_brodor: playing a mage after playing enhance and I literally don't know what to do with all these buttons
[2:01:14] khebul: Outlaw rogue is another outlier in that sense in dungeons
[2:01:16] thatstender: some fights i dont even press all my buttons and i dont die aha ha
[2:01:17] AoPsyke: i just want to keep alter time
[2:01:21] UnheardGrace: mages have what, 6 buttons?
[2:01:26] Emiltharia: Good take tbh. As a DK main in general I do feel sort of hard done by in DF tbh. I think Frost and Unholy not having access to mass grip is so problematic and we havent had our rework yet so in that regard we are also just "behind"
[2:01:27] AoPsyke: mirror images back dps cd maybe
[2:01:35] Neomagam: Fire mage with 4 defensives and a cheat death is criminal (I say as a fire mage)
[2:01:37] antonwnw: Healing mages when they ran out of buttons is horrible
[2:01:41] Harthad: ben then again you're talking about pve, removing defensive on a cloth char feelsbad
[2:01:45] UnheardGrace: 6 buttons + cauterize on fire
[2:01:53] doryangreey: I believe that the Russian Federation needs to block igart on the servers
[2:01:58] fat_european0: I would gladly have a button removed as mage if they put more of our stuff off the GCD
[2:02:02] Thowarr: It will always include mage and rogue; gl other three
[2:02:03] Gamerhcp: beep beep beep
[2:02:09] slickrazor2: hi chat o/
[2:02:14] Gamerhcp: there was an earthquake in LA apparently
[2:02:17] Saeshal: no
[2:02:17] Gamerhcp: maybe its related to that
[2:02:20] PeziBear_: as tank, yes
[2:02:22] caveman2x: only in my dreams they are
[2:02:24] grobb12: only if they did way more damage then the rest
[2:02:24] heisnberg94: @UnheardGrace u have no diea, ring of frost, cs blast wave, remove curse etc.
[2:02:24] GrimFandango: the damage would have to be 20% above everyone else
[2:02:24] Joneim: No, they'd have to do the most dmg by like 10%
[2:02:24] darksoldier2245: Nah
[2:02:25] m_g_power: maybe prot :(
[2:02:25] UnheardGrace: not unless it's prot being busted
[2:02:26] headninja1ncharge: never
[2:02:27] doryangreey: Русские игроки черти
[2:02:29] Lullitawar: with this toolkit and this max 5 target .. no
[2:02:29] doryangreey: I believe that the Russian Federation needs to block igart on the servers
[2:02:41] Emiltharia: Warrior had a good spot in Legion (ToS patch)
[2:02:42] goblingher: Bfa pwar meta
[2:02:43] potatofarmer: warriors are kings of classic, so they have to pay for it in retail. That is my shit theory
[2:02:45] doryangreey: РУсские игрокит черти
[2:02:47] fat_european0: Spell Reflect + D-stance is really good for keys, no?
[2:02:53] splashz0r: @doryangreey WideBoris
[2:02:57] ph00lish: maybe some capstone that makes it so rage spenders inside of your big CD's generate stacks of ign ore pain, that passive dr could help a lot
[2:02:57] CoffeeASAP: I can imagine DH being meta PepeLaugh
[2:02:57] cosmoshabitant: I can, spell reflect chunks 50% of boss health pool in one shot
[2:02:59] PeziBear_: we need a healer specc for warrior Kappa
[2:03:00] doryangreey: Русские игроки черти
[2:03:07] doryangreey: I believe that the Russian Federation needs to block igart on the servers
[2:03:08] Thowarr: Yes, it's better to have a mage which has a fuck ton of dps, fuck ton of utility, fuck ton of defensiveness, with ZERO downsides
[2:03:15] Emiltharia: ToS
[2:03:15] Pwoahv: legion
[2:03:19] caveman2x: TOS
[2:03:20] duplexity_dave: Legion?
[2:03:20] Saeshal: maybe in legion
[2:03:20] Zarroe: wrath at least
[2:03:21] Newlander: Classic
[2:03:21] Emiltharia: Warrior was good in ToS patch
[2:03:21] devilssin123: Nighthold?
[2:03:22] Birdytom: In Legion
[2:03:22] Luquetinha: Tomb
[2:03:26] PeziBear_: legion s3
[2:03:26] tenassity69: legion before target fuck
[2:03:27] Harthad: legion
[2:03:27] Lullitawar: it was prot war legion
[2:03:28] Montiguy: Spell reflect op
[2:03:29] heisnberg94: Liczh king
[2:03:29] caveman2x: tomb 100%
[2:03:33] enigmasvea: fragnance with nighthold trinket
[2:03:34] cosmoshabitant: season of discovery
[2:03:34] zapdead: they were ALMOST meta, but then they released aug evoker kekw
[2:03:36] potatofarmer: Warrior was good in Naxx 40
[2:03:37] omega88: Give them mass spell reflect for memes. And maybe a shield/conal Dr ability behind them darknessque
[2:03:37] Korupcija_: bring back legion class design
[2:03:46] Thowarr: Survival was meta before any dps war spec was
[2:03:53] Emiltharia: World first high key Cathedral was done with double Arms warrior (Fragnance was one of them)
[2:04:00] BigBadAzz1: Yes please @Korupcija_
[2:04:08] Saeshal: warriors had too much fun in classic so they decided to never let them have fun again PepeLaugh
[2:04:08] Maxdeath1: Does blizzard hate ele shamans
[2:04:34] Emiltharia: @Maximum
[2:04:39] Thowarr: @Saeshal True; they had Mortal Strike, and that was it
[2:04:42] icelance0: feral druid :)
[2:04:46] Emiltharia: @Maxdeath1 Yes. Get ready to become a support spec
[2:04:55] Nukum1: rallying cry should be bloodlust and the current rallying cry should be renamed
[2:05:10] thunder993: Nothing
[2:05:11] corebitz: rally and ap
[2:05:11] Joneim: Shout PepeLaugh
[2:05:12] headninja1ncharge: BS
[2:05:16] johnathew: battle shout Kappa
[2:05:19] caveman2x: give us battle shout lust
[2:05:20] Scoopachip: make drums 25 percent haste again
[2:05:21] caveman2x: pls blizz
[2:05:26] Emiltharia: @Nukum1 Good take but it isnt called Rally atm even :D Its commanding shout

[2:05:28] Thowarr: All I'm hearing is that dps war needs an entire rework on every aspect of their identity
[2:05:32] Fuzziew: WW needs some kind of misdirect/Tot right now. Threat is broken for them
[2:05:33] thesupplier69: @ devs this man spittin
[2:05:38] leubinator: bloodlust is fake utility only the strongest lustuser gets invited most of the times
[2:05:39] Wincrediboy: can you explain what's meant by 'damage profile'? as a casual tank player I only half understand it
[2:06:00] Harleybane: Rally could be an absorb shield
[2:06:03] Thowarr: They nerfed Rally by, what, 40% last patch?
[2:06:05] Montiguy: Intervene should have a DR like sac
[2:06:13] Emiltharia: @Wincrediboy A damage profile might be like constant consistent damage or high damage every two minutes because of cooldowns etc
[2:06:15] Faraday5001: same with AM
[2:06:15] imbaztank22: AP buff
[2:06:19] ph00lish: give warr lust
[2:06:22] HeffaBear: I kind of liked the banner bitch playstyle in mop. Big dam and support
[2:06:25] m_g_power: sad part is warrior is so much fun to play... sadge
[2:06:26] Lullitawar: @Maximum Berserker rage was not use in warrior toolkit for ages
[2:06:27] slugg_tk: @wincrediboy things like how good at single target vs how many targets, how often they have cooldowns and how much of their damage happens during cooldowns
[2:06:39] Korupcija_: @m_g_power HUH
[2:06:39] caveman2x: warrior simply needs a fersh coat of paint
[2:06:46] omega88: Mass spell reflect
[2:06:48] cptjohnnnn: Hi Max first twitch stream ive watched... can you pleaseeeeeeee do more undercover raid leading/m+?
[2:06:50] Cycore: at least war has a raid buff, dk has nothing LUL
[2:06:51] Thowarr: Rallying Cry was nerfed in 10.2
[2:06:54] slickrazor2: @Maximum we need homoginization in the class design so players who like the gameplay of a class dont have to go with a spec they dont want to play
[2:06:57] texas_grizzly: They should get battle standards, kinda like what they had in SL but better
[2:06:57] noewon: why dont warrior's have bloodlust ?
[2:07:04] Keppie__: That class tree is so shit with all those random none talents
[2:07:05] Emiltharia: @Maximum I agree with basically everything you just said, but as a DK Dps Main I still feel hard done by. Not having mass grip is so bad and we havent gotten a rework yet so its just even worse because of that as well
[2:07:08] jerkmcgee: warrior just needs their talent tree to not have so much mandatory damage
[2:07:10] MVPBuster: for the love of god can we kill single minded fury
[2:07:15] Empirics_: Its a mess?
[2:07:18] ph00lish: Idea: Warr gets stacks of ignore pain when they use rage spenders inside of Big CD's, ton of passive tankiness
[2:07:21] Reap232: Shockwave is in the tree?
[2:07:23] lazerj07: pvp
[2:07:24] zysmos: AoE cap sucks on warriors
[2:07:29] Maxdeath1: Yeah makes 0 sense LOL
[2:07:29] Keppie__: Those dmg things isnt even the worst problem
[2:07:32] Thowarr: Damage, damage, damage... and we're nowhere even close to top damage
[2:07:34] othernewname: aoe stun is op  Kappa
[2:07:42] slugg_tk: Mage players wouldn't take that sitting down
[2:07:43] NaBNez: dmg needs to be on spec tree tbh
[2:07:43] ph00lish: basically if warr were boomkins lol
[2:07:47] BigBadAzz1: I said it back in the Demon Hunter Discord
[2:07:51] lonesomecowboy: if warriors were boomkins that capstone would be GONE
[2:07:51] Thowarr: @othernewname Yes, warstomp is!
[2:07:52] NaBNez: not on class tree
[2:07:53] Vordie: Need a new Critcake "I am upset" video
[2:07:54] GrimFandango: They just need to make different trees for PVP, it's time
[2:08:00] Daesaster: @Maximum Hey max, are you able to shed any light on how to  optimize our chances @ getting the leggo? If we kill Fyrakk on H, should we run and kill Fyrakk on Norm and LFR also? TY for your time.
[2:08:01] LeoricDidNothingWrong: now look a monk tree
[2:08:07] NaBNez: class tree needs to be fully utility and defnesives
[2:08:10] Dilgi_: DELETE PVP NOONE PLAYS IT OMFG LUL
[2:08:25] Brobi: @Maximum can you please write a 7 in paint?
[2:08:29] Keppie__: Look at all those 15 range 10% dmg on whirlwind stuff like that is so bad
[2:08:35] Suwah84: would this game be better without pvp?
[2:08:35] Keppie__: rage*
[2:08:38] corebitz: As a 3 warrior toon player ty
[2:08:41] Puffmac: I love my prot war
[2:08:46] tommymage: not sure. in mop they had 2 sec charge stun sotmrbolt and shockwave and most pvpers love mop pvp
[2:08:48] mistifi_: they have pvp modifiers, make shockwave target capped or something in pvp
[2:08:52] AoPsyke: i wish they'D replace shockwave with the night fae spell instead
[2:09:03] Montiguy: Just give us shockwave. Rouge has a billion stuns in pvp. Wtf
[2:09:04] deviljin____: Class design is cool and all, but at the end of the day people will complain if the class doesn't rank well in dps stats, and thats it
[2:09:09] Lullitawar: That way easier to play war prot than before yes , magic isnt a full pain , only bleeding
[2:09:14] NaBNez: warr need stuff to interact with the new affixes too man, its kinda weird they dont got stuff
[2:09:27] Brimz: bleeds and dots that we can't reflect absolutely shred us
[2:09:28] 101Leet: Hey Max! Good to see you bud, been thinking about you recently. Not in a para social way but just been building my own trees with your voice in my head
[2:09:30] Brimz: its so brutal
[2:09:41] panser_nes: Ancient Aftershock
[2:09:45] yawgmothsupp: Support warr like d3 shiut hook barb
[2:09:47] caveman2x: aoe and dot
[2:09:48] lumaday: ancient aftershock
[2:09:49] Harthad: to be op warr needs lots of utility baseline
[2:09:57] Harleybane: What they need to do is remove shockwave in total, add in a talent which makes the other 2 to stun if target has thunderclap debuff on them, 2/4sec 1/2 points
[2:09:57] enigmasvea: fragnance with nighthold trinket
[2:09:58] Pyrrha_GG: slippy ground
[2:10:04] yonima: HUH
[2:10:05] MortsyFGC: LUL
[2:10:06] GrimFandango: Hey Max! Good to see you bud, been thinking about you recently. Not in a para social way but just been building my own trees with your voice in my head
[2:10:06] i_wish_southbadboy: LOL
[2:10:07] Jazzarus_: KEKW
[2:10:08] Clarius: tf

[2:10:13] NaBNez: xdd
[2:10:17] ribosomes322: totally not parasocial
[2:10:19] conchelobe: I hope he means talent trees lol
[2:10:25] Jazzarus_: maybe he's watching your videos with an apple vision
[2:10:28] NaBNez: weirdge
[2:10:35] Harleybane: spear and roar ya
[2:10:36] darksoldier2245: Dafuq
[2:11:01] SonicX05: why do they have so many capstones
[2:11:05] Harthad: next to hammer
[2:11:09] UnheardGrace: they could bring back the necrolord banner
[2:11:17] Harleybane: warriors have 4 last row talents, monk has 3 statues which all 3 is pretty shit KEKW
[2:11:18] fat_european0: they should move bitter immunity as well so you can take it easily
[2:11:18] Harthad: choose hammer/shock
[2:11:22] darksoldier2245: Banner was nuts
[2:11:25] Do0dy93: Prot warriors should have an option for Polearm & shield as a weapon option
[2:11:45] dimofodi: Give Shockwave a longer cd and put it on like row 7 or 8 like blinding light for paladin
[2:11:46] Joneim: It procs once in a blue moon and is hard to see
[2:11:53] Harthad: @Do0dy93 good idea
[2:12:04] Saeshal: can u not use that for sub rogue? on smolderon? to get an extra use of shadowblades/flag
[2:12:19] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm triHmm
[2:12:36] Harleybane: @Do0dy93 Why? then you have even more people on 2h wpn and even less on 1h str, just the ability to transmog is enough
[2:12:37] Hoaw: if they add a new power system in 2 expansions after hero talents, wont it become too bloated? what do you recommend as a solution to keep things fresh? @Maximum
[2:12:43] LionButLeon: Corpa 󠀀
[2:13:02] Saeshal: Ive seen people do that with the holy paladin talent, with the seasons talent
[2:13:05] Montiguy: What if for season 4 they had all the mythic+ dungeon in season 4 but made keys have 3 dungeon on them?
[2:13:21] stonedboodah: on a side ***n we rework frost DK tho.
[2:13:34] Piroshkiii: Piroshkiii subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[2:13:43] Saeshal: because the season of autumn or whatever is called, reduces ur shadowblades cd by like 10% so you can use it 1 extra time in the fight, in smolderon
[2:13:44] SonicX05: @Hoaw it sounded like they were just going to add different hero talents, adding essentially just more flavor classes, but not just more and more talents
[2:13:47] noewon: Madge delete all external buffs
[2:13:49] SpeedyMcD: @maximum do you think they will work on talent trees and possibly rework some bad trees or are they way too focused on hero talents to change anything?
[2:13:53] Maxdeath1: Is there an alarm going off in your room
[2:13:58] Hoaw: OHHH you cooked, i never heard that recommendation before. if your mythic+ key allows you to choose between like 2 or 3 dungeons that would be epic no?
[2:14:03] Paleee_: @Maximum Did you talk about the key levels/affixes for MDI week1?
[2:14:06] LucasSterling_: @Maximum how would the logs look like with cooldown reduction
[2:14:07] Do0dy93: @Harleybane true but what's wrong with having options? i'm not saying "all 2h weapons with a shield" just polearms, heck, imagine a shaman with a shield and stick?
[2:14:10] LionButLeon: SCHIZO
[2:14:22] zafearce: change war rally from a health increase to a party wide cheat death
[2:14:22] NaBNez: cdr
[2:14:35] Madgeneto: lol
[2:14:57] MortsyFGC: It sounds like a lot of the niche mechanics are like a playground of possibilities
[2:14:58] fat_european0: Agreed. I really like it
[2:15:09] Benjg7: my hpal hates having to hold blessing to give me autumn for fyrakk
[2:15:27] Clarius: blessing of seasons is a terribly designed spell
[2:15:27] Joneim: xdd
[2:15:30] LionButLeon: xdd
[2:15:30] Benjg7: all the time
[2:15:31] MortsyFGC: Clip it and ship it, Ben
[2:15:35] Joneim: BASED
[2:15:38] Suwah84: I like buffing my friends as healer wish they added more
[2:15:39] noewon: KEKW stfu and heal lil bro
[2:15:40] eggs_boiled: healers speak when spoken to
[2:15:41] Skydanzer: xdd
[2:15:47] RenegadeHeals: love playgrounds
[2:15:49] Pyrrha_GG: so what is your problem with oracle hero talents then if they will have other options if they dont like that?
[2:15:54] Keppie__: Yes
[2:15:54] Clarius: the way it rotates through the blessings makes it neigh impossible to use for anything useful
[2:15:57] sheckles: A saying in my guild is shut up and heal KEKW
[2:16:00] srze94: @eggs_boiled lel
[2:16:09] Zizonyx: eavLurk
[2:16:25] bigmeanbeefy: gonna be a dog eat dog match
[2:16:43] GoodyGodfather: What is the cats team name?
[2:16:44] TyHeals: We need Echo vs Last Hope
[2:16:45] ahri_feet_connoisseur: i just want to see an mdi where echo doesnt win
[2:16:48] LucasSterling_: echo are gonna be able to hide all of their tech in that first match
[2:16:49] Skydanzer: 2nd day, its Saturday
[2:16:50] Goodnevi1: Day 2 it's color coded
[2:16:50] Keppie__: 4-5
[2:16:53] Skydanzer: diff colours are diff days
[2:16:55] Jjmn12: the colors show the days of the matches
[2:16:56] Xanctius: @Maximum Can see dates by colors on top
[2:16:59] Bliindmonk: what do you think of the current leggendary system?
[2:16:59] Fuzziew: There needs to be a "Team Non Vocal"
[2:17:00] Dengara: Match 1-4 day 1, match 5-10 day 2
[2:17:19] Keppie__: no
[2:17:23] Flipeled: no, same layout

[2:18:11] zeitgeiz: dude it’s so good
[2:18:13] Bliindmonk: what do you think of the current leggendary system?
[2:18:14] Keppie__: wasnt that yesterday?
[2:18:14] CoffeeASAP: oatmeal is bis
[2:18:16] Joneim: Over night is even easier
[2:18:16] Do0dy93: @Maximum what about changing warrior to 1 dps spec, 1 tank spec and then 1 buff spec that makes people do more damage with shouts, call it "commander" and it deals with more interrupts, CC and helping with group defense stuff?
[2:18:18] GrimmshadoXI: Damn that transition was brought to us by ADHD
[2:18:19] SerasVallo: what about oatmeal?
[2:18:20] zeitgeiz: throw some fruit and honey in it
[2:18:22] Skydanzer: Deflect YEP
[2:18:24] conchelobe: best RL in the world. just learning oatmeal
[2:18:31] srze94: why does this bracket look so weird
[2:18:33] goulashnihao: op
[2:18:34] baezmejia200: GOOD
[2:18:36] stonedboodah: Pog
[2:18:39] imurweaknesslive: Bois, is Oat meal Porridge? asking from the UK

[2:18:40] popzugzugz: "overnight flavor" hahahaha
[2:18:41] jerkmcgee: look at mr moneybags over here w/ berries
[2:18:42] Fuzziew: Toss 2 fried eggs in there. So good
[2:18:43] Italicuss: brown sugar is also good
[2:18:45] lolwhateverdog: do that with yogurt and granola and its bis
[2:18:46] HakiThunderFox: thats pawg
[2:18:47] Grimwel87: throw some peanut butter powder in there
[2:18:49] ICitizenErasedI: low GI too
[2:18:49] FluffyDooom: "Who just have berries on hand tho" -Max the other day
[2:18:52] VRVento: who just has berries
[2:18:54] Grimwel87: or protein powder
[2:18:55] santalylth: holy f
[2:18:57] Joneim: WICKED
[2:18:58] Reap232: Pog
[2:18:58] Ellasande: I put brown sugar, cinnamon and walnuts
[2:18:59] LubaJunior: vanilla extract ? thats shit is sweet as fuck no doubt you have tits like my mama
[2:19:06] dustin_handsupdb: @imurweaknesslive you guys call it porridge, it's technically a porridge but its one of those oatmeal is a porridge but porridge isn't oatmeal things
[2:19:06] Ok_Kingston: Never played em, never lost
[2:19:06] m_g_power: WOw dorki is bad ass
[2:19:06] Joneim: @LubaJunior ???????
[2:19:07] antipheonixna: i make 2 sheet pans of granola a month easiest breakfest of my life
[2:19:07] Bliindmonk: what do you think of the current leggendary system?
[2:19:11] zero808pt: is dorki playing?
[2:19:12] Wincrediboy: is dorki feeling confident yet? didn't they start practice super late?
[2:19:12] Faraday5001: @LubaJunior firstGarf
[2:19:18] IamBadSry: @LubaJunior  KEKWait
[2:19:21] greatangelsanguinius: Gotta stop gassing dorki lol
[2:19:23] Reap232: @LubaJunior 1. Vanilla has no sugar, you're dumb.  2. ?????? what?
[2:19:27] Montiguy: For warrior, make rally bring  an ally up from died. Giving them the hp even if they were died. And if it expires and it rezzed with it you died instead of going to 1hp @maximum
[2:19:30] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @LubaJunior vanilla extract doesnt have sugar dumbass
[2:19:33] dustin_handsupdb: @LubaJunior you do realize vanilla extract contains 0 calories
[2:19:37] mfalc: INCHS USA CUPS USA MILES USA
[2:19:38] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Dentge
[2:19:49] fairchildx: @Maximum cover the AWC ;)
[2:19:57] thenateo2: 22 is gonnaa be insanely fast
[2:20:03] Wincrediboy: why isn't there a liquid MDI/TGP team? Just not players who are interested?
[2:20:04] StanRaenslen: 22 tyran everbloom holy
[2:20:07] Thatguy8795: muro rize 24 tho
[2:20:09] Skydanzer: 22 fall Sleeper
[2:20:19] ahri_feet_connoisseur: it's basically a speedrun competition right?
[2:20:21] Onyo1337: 22 tyran, just pull all the trash on boss

[2:20:32] sheckles: demon waycrest monkaS
[2:20:34] Bliindmonk: what do you think of the current leggendary system?
[2:20:34] Keppie__: 2x Sanguine AINTNOWAY
[2:20:35] Jazzarus_: how do they decide the affixes?
[2:20:36] simply_42: everbloom and BRH are complete out with sanguine
[2:20:44] BlazinHurricane: Sanguine everbloom MonkaS
[2:20:47] ahri_feet_connoisseur: true
[2:20:49] stonedboodah: should be 24 25 26
[2:20:52] NaBNez: we will see
[2:20:56] Virridian: @stonedboodah na
[2:21:05] stonedboodah: @stonedboodah 22 is insane
[2:21:06] JansonLives: they are going to be flying through eb.
[2:21:07] Skydanzer: Sanguine BRH corridors cant wait
[2:21:09] Zambinga: Good take
[2:21:09] Thowarr: So any time Echo plays
[2:21:20] GrimmshadoXI: @moonzqt Sanguine is not nearly as bad as it used to be. Pros will have no issue with it
[2:21:31] VRVento: that’s key level is way more relatable to someone who’s like a high end casual player. like you know what that damage is like ect.
[2:21:32] IBlackIHIawk: i wannt see a +20 thrown in there
[2:21:37] stonedboodah: @stonedboodah u can go look in lfr right now and see nothing but 25-26 but the trop teams are doing 22 in comp? for sure for sure
[2:21:37] IBlackIHIawk: and just see a BLASTER
[2:21:38] Bliindmonk: what do you think of the current leggendary system?
[2:21:44] PeziBear_: 22 is too low
[2:21:47] stonedboodah: lfg*
[2:21:48] Brobi: Sanguine and Bolstering are going to kill any fun pulls. Literally half of the dungeons are fucked due to them
[2:21:51] LucasSterling_: +18 and they pull whole dungeon
[2:21:52] NaBNez: yea echo win again...big surprise
[2:22:05] simply_42: @GrimmshadoXI sure but it was always vote out befor
[2:22:10] ahri_feet_connoisseur: echo is the gsw of mdi
[2:22:12] tenassity69: does doing this stuff not get boring?
[2:22:12] Thatguy8795: everbloom is gonna be like 4 pulls total
[2:22:44] Madgeneto: delete all affixes BASED
[2:22:47] fat_european0: They should remove on-death affixes and replace it with a seasonal
[2:22:56] ahri_feet_connoisseur: remove all affixes
[2:23:05] JansonLives: At least DHT is bolstering tyran.
[2:23:07] Lullitawar: Sanguin as no effect because of DH overbroken grap and silent
[2:23:09] stonedboodah: rework all affixes. stop the recycling routine
[2:23:09] Brobi: @Thatguy8795 Not possible due to sanguine...
[2:23:10] Onyo1337: @ahri_feet_connoisseur sus name
[2:23:15] nightst314: FINSA is btw the worst affix comb
[2:23:16] itsRMP: echo in sanguine key is gapplebees central
[2:23:18] GrimmshadoXI: @moonzqt Because it was before it got nerfed to the ground is what I'm saying
[2:23:49] darksoldier2245: Funnel is really good ATM tho
[2:23:52] Thatguy8795: @Brobi dont think that matters much, it actually makes it more likely they pull more if its mobs with somewhat same health
[2:23:59] Ok_Kingston: bring a dh for sanguine ggwp
[2:24:01] CladeusXE: i wish they never did target caps
[2:24:02] JiminyCracker: i wonder why didnt they put bolsterting on Everbloom xdd i wonder
[2:24:03] LucasSterling_: explosive also did that, thank god its gone
[2:24:05] Arfie: sanguine with frost mage in the team pcpattAllergy
[2:24:17] Lullitawar: waycrest Manor fortified bolstering ? its hard no ?
[2:24:23] Scu11: what do you think of sanguine being changed to shrink the pool as mobs get healed
[2:24:27] Snydezz: Not a car guy if you have never heard Gapplebees
[2:24:34] Larocca_88: my biggest criticism of MDI is that it's not TGP.
[2:24:47] Virridian: @Larocca_88 True! LUL
[2:25:00] Brobi: @Brobi In Tyran you want to pull mobs on top of boss. The two bosses you can pull on top of in EB are static, so sanguine is horrible
[2:25:07] ImMGO: what is the difference between MDI and TGP?
[2:25:12] surrealasaurus: sometimes i put mayonnaise on my cereal. feels good to be european :)
[2:25:16] fat_european0: @Larocca_88 Mine is that it's a speedrunning tournament, but they don't allow the teams to abuse tech to go as fast as possible
[2:25:17] Bliindmonk: what do you think of the current leggendary system?
[2:25:23] VRVento: remember when they gave explosive actual health In beta
[2:25:26] HakiThunderFox: @ImMGO in the MDI they play lower keys fast, in TGP they try to push for the highest key possibe
[2:25:29] Ok_Kingston: MDI has its place
[2:25:47] ImMGO: @HakiThunderFox ty :)
[2:25:57] infraredpen: MDI is so much easier for me to watch. 2 teams side by side, racing
[2:26:02] HakiThunderFox: @ImMGO They still play 23-25 keys in the MDI tho and do pulls like its a 15-20 LuL
[2:26:05] Thatguy8795: @Brobi ur not wrong in that they want to pull on top of boss. But the fact that it's only 22 the mobs are gonna die so fast anyway due to Tyran
[2:26:10] Larocca_88: @fat_european0 idk the speedrun format is just so uninteresting since wiping is usually a loss
[2:26:16] zukohonor: torghast modifiers in M+, gg
[2:26:18] Fuzziew: I remember when the orbs on last boss in underrot spawned explosives. What a disaster
[2:26:35] CladeusXE: or atleast delete target cap in MDI
[2:26:35] Flipeled: MDI peaks are higher imo
[2:26:56] Montiguy: For warrior, make rally bring  an ally up from died. Giving them the hp even if they were died. And if it expires and it rezzed with it you died instead of going to 1hp
[2:26:57] fat_european0: @Larocca_88 Yeah those matches suck. But I personally really love speedrunning. Seeing Blizz crack down on using bugs has made me way less interested though.
[2:27:20] sneakerplayy: mdi boring af to watch
[2:27:21] LucasSterling_: TGP has plot?
[2:27:33] Jumanjiqt: what time do you have to leave Max? isn't it soon
[2:27:38] Larocca_88: @Faraday5001 I am big into speedrunning in other games, like souls games and stuff like that, but i just don't love it in WoW
[2:27:56] PopsButNotDad: hey @Maximum what would it take for liquid to get a team up to snuff to compete in MDI and other mythic dungeon tourneys?
[2:28:00] Fuzziew: What a time to be alive. Method NA
[2:28:06] TyHeals: It's actually criminal that Druid is meta (if a healer is played) and Jb doesnt have a team
[2:28:13] Thowarr: With both MDI and TGP, you first acknowledge that Echo will win. You're simply watching to see who'll place where after that
[2:28:22] Brobi: The last Halls of Valor in MDI DF 1 was insane Pog
[2:28:33] Fuzziew: When Ben was playing WW
[2:28:52] itsRMP: idk seeing them bang that 30/31/32 or whatever it was freehold and nelths went hard
[2:28:54] Scu11: the plaguefall with 2 tanks in the first TGP that echo did as a buzzer beater final was amazing for story
[2:28:55] UnheardGrace: oh man I miss tazavesh
[2:28:55] pekad14: halls of valor mdi last dungeon pull
[2:28:58] LionButLeon: baseg
[2:28:59] Jazzarus_: your cook about a tournament where classes are worth points and you get a point limit was pretty good, any chance that happens? @Maximum
[2:29:02] infraredpen: don't care about your take
[2:29:04] byfantacy: Good take Max
[2:29:15] Dengara: They fixed some everbloom cheese.. wonder if the teams were using that
[2:29:17] GrimmshadoXI: Wait, we can just say our take is right? Talk about a life hack
[2:29:19] corebitz: this stream is more of an infant at this now
[2:29:50] Zambinga: when you said counterintuitive did you mean bolstering is antithetical to the MDI?
[2:30:05] antipheonixna: make each spec a % multiplier and let people build their own keys for points 5Head
[2:30:30] Wincrediboy: I don't know if Blizzard would ever officially release something that says officially "this class is better than your class"
[2:30:35] TyHeals: So you came up with FanDuel for WoW? :)
[2:30:41] althenian: i think you shouldnt do it this way, because there are always gonna be outliers, imo you should just get points for every different class you play
[2:30:42] ches3tr: ches3tr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[2:31:15] slickrazor2: chat is affliction warlock worth playing because everyone seems really down on it Sadge
[2:31:16] LucasSterling_: is this where u buy a one time ticket for a spec and its locked next dungeon?
[2:31:30] Kippereno: Kippereno subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! love u man keep it up
[2:31:35] Fackoz_: The 0p for the really swampy specs was the best cook
[2:31:36] Suwah84: this is infinitely more interesting than the mdi
[2:31:39] Jazzarus_: love this idea
[2:31:39] ches3tr: @slickrazor2 i just got 2800 with it. it is fine, but you will be bullied
[2:31:43] L8R_Ajay: L8R_Ajay subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Good day sir
[2:31:54] kedrius_: I feel like assigning value to specs would be the biggest issue. And if you can clearly assign such value to specs something is very wrong with class balance.
[2:32:02] KaisenSiru: -1
[2:32:08] LionButLeon: "then make them good" baseg
[2:32:12] JakeParkbench: Just make aug 15points
[2:32:23] malavander: What about a draft style, where by the end every spec has to be used.
[2:32:24] Hoaw: so put them at 0, in the middle
[2:32:28] GrimFandango: Surv seems pretty good for damage, idk
[2:32:30] m_g_power: then why it never happened
[2:32:35] Wincrediboy: what about a team comp draft of some sort - you can't use the same specs as the other team, or can't use the same specs from dungeon to dungeon
[2:32:35] LionButLeon: Ele 2 points ICANT
[2:32:38] thoromyr19: the mental picture of Blizzard going mehhhhh is hilarious
[2:32:39] drewsky96: then your scaling shouldn't be linear, that could also solve that problem without a negative
[2:32:41] Zentrada: just change it to plus one for you total value
[2:32:53] kedrius_: @malavander drafts are my favorite part of moba esports
[2:32:57] surrealasaurus: this is like when u make rice but it too hot to eat in your mouth
[2:32:59] goombacci: is this in MDI format? (why is guardian over the good tanks?)
[2:32:59] JQ47: I really hope you do that at some point
[2:33:02] FieldMedic_Feywyn: Very cool idea.
[2:33:08] IamBadSry: @malavander fearless draft
[2:33:18] conchelobe: dop iot in season 4
[2:33:20] duplexity_dave: The only issue i see is you have to have everyone have a max geared character for  every class
[2:33:22] Zentrada: what about s4 doing it?
[2:33:22] Brobi: possibility for S4 tournament
[2:33:23] srze94: would it work as a draft with picks and bans? @Maximum
