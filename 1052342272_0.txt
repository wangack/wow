[5:21:45] CliffWoW: Sad to say, your game play as a rogue is most likely a 75% skilled rogue. Without full world buff like warchief blessing or fast kill times from your guild. You would be a blue parser as best. Lots of miss-played in a lot of boss fights. Don’t take this as hate but motivation to play better in future raids.

[7:57:47] benihana303: NotLikeThis
[7:58:31] akaleara: week 1 entry level is equivalent to 2 months of grinding naxx gear and doing saph/kt imo
[7:58:39] benihana303: Yeah hourglass is so good
[7:58:47] akaleara: 4hm/saph is very difficult for bad guilds cus it requires more than just dpsing
