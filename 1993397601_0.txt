[2:04:47] mt_abd132: @flashwell_ ??????
[2:04:49] Knives27: @evsies Inertia belongs in Tarkov, it's meant to be more of a sim than some CoD arcade crap. People who are playing Tarkov for the right reasons don't seem to mind it at all, it's not like the game has gotten less popular just because they introduced a good mechanic

[3:00:59] AceOfHalo2: @kynon5097 only for pc
[3:01:03] Avatars1k: @xrubious Idk for me it feels weird, not what I expected from extraction shooter, I played like 1k hours in the Cycle Frontier and I absolutely loved it, but this game on the other hand feels worse with movement, TTK and the fact that it's more "battle royale" (the fact that you loot guns and all that stuff in a match, but can't bring it out)
[3:01:06] DevilsLasagna: <message eaten>
[3:01:17] haddadi96: Is this game still on beta?

[5:23:31] Extract1ng: yo chat, is sharing the faith quest for priest bugged ???? i tried kneeling and nothing...
[5:23:31] fidd1efunk: the main thing that makes shamans able to tank now is that people believe in it. it worked before, you just had to believe it in it. because of the added runes, people are more comfortable with in a general sense
[5:23:43] hunntcho: @aceofhalo2 blackfathom depths and shadow fang keep
[5:23:45] TheMadG3rman: SFK is Shadowfang Keep, and BFD is Blackfathom Deep

[5:32:13] Haishish: most ppl wont hit 25 in a day
[5:32:14] Hoppelben: It´s basically you being able to level slowly without feeling behind @shroud

[5:32:22] SunZinni: christ in a day is crazyyy

[5:32:33] swissoh: They said they are doing the xp buff for the previous tier once the new tier drops.
[5:32:35] a7smokey3r: what realm you playing on?
[5:32:36] Hoppelben: No he means 1 day played time
[5:32:37] Suhei: they said, there will be catch up mechs
[5:32:39] Hoppelben: Thats very possible
[5:32:40] han_saro: its like an expansion release every time they up the level cap
[5:32:40] gurbalicious: they said the previous phase will get a exp increase
[5:32:41] SlimeTM: They are doing that. prior cap level is faster
[5:32:43] swissoh: The joyous journey buff

[5:33:05] AceOfHalo2: would be smart if they made it faster for sure
[5:33:06] clancylegit: you get to experience the dungeons and other things you would normally just ignore while you lvl
[5:33:08] imbenyay: just sit down for 24 hours. easy peezy
[5:33:18] Triviuhh: Is 25 the level cap for this or something?
[5:33:19] Alex_Reaperzzz: @shroud as much as I love WoW and I do, I do want to ask if you are planning on playing an FPS today or if it is just a full WoW stream?
[5:33:23] a7smokey3r: what realm does he play on?
[5:33:28] JakeDive: Dual wield shaman is fun
[5:33:29] Taelix318: Feels like less of a slog, especially when most of the community is progressing at about the same pace. You don't have long stretches of doing solo content because lots of other people will more likely be doing the same quests as you so you have a larger pool of potential people to help you...

[5:34:58] CallMeDuck: @shroud is  your guild open
[5:34:58] azzepted: what stats do a shaman tank want? spellpower?
[5:35:05] fakeskuH: Getting to 60 is ass because classic is ass though. It's a 20 year old game that's being drip fed to feign relevance. I mean, don't get me wrong I'm happy for whoever enjoys it but I genuinely believe it'd be dead within a week if not for the timegating.

[5:36:42] after_shave: shaman were intended to be tanks , it just never went live for some reason in vanilla 2003
[5:36:44] holymary1: earth shock fas so efective that you were sometimes kiked from group :D
[5:36:49] Slikmeerathan: @yomalakai_ ty
[5:36:50] fidd1efunk: Rockbiter melees increase threat. Molten blast commands instant threat on up to 4 targets
[5:36:51] PainkillerDCXVI: 4 years... Aware
[5:36:53] SunZinni: its hardcore seasonal
[5:36:58] SoaDivine: question is do tank shamans use DW or shield. bc fury is better than prot
[5:36:58] paperinoo: fire nova totem doesnt give threat right?
[5:37:05] holymary1: because you were taking argo as mad man
[5:37:11] medicjr22: i wanna get wow but also feel like it would be a waist cuz i have no idea what to do or how to do anything with this game

[5:39:47] soaptastesok7: 6 boss needs good dps rest is easy
[5:39:59] after_shave: i honestly didnt know bfd was a raid , i assumed it was a 5 man all this time
[5:40:16] kingkizido: @after_shave its only a raid in season of discovery
[5:40:16] TheMadG3rman: It normally is a 5 man, it's been altered for SoD
[5:40:32] holymary1: btw do you know raid limitation during week? only one time?
[5:40:33] after_shave: oh makes sense

[11:59:54] Rev_4_Life: I think the problem is less of the fact that there isnt a wow token and more of the fact that tokens are a 3rd of the amount of gold you could get for the same price.
[11:59:54] HardlyCamping: schrogg!
[11:59:58] oh_nico: @glornius conutSadge
