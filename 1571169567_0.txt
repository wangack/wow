[0:59:44] GamingDad77: @Honvar not too far from it

[1:26:54] iforceftw: link?
[1:26:54] luckfore: wow killer? :O
[1:26:58] Sollice: League has HUGE amounts of Lore

[1:27:16] LordOverflow: He made one about classes and factions lately
[1:27:24] Timmychanga12: Hey @towelliee out of all the tank specs you’ve played in alpha, which have felt the most fun to play in dungeons?
[1:27:30] LordOverflow: or well races
[1:27:30] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Dragon riding will just become riding eventually lol
[1:27:35] Kinghorn: I learned all I need to know from Arcane
[1:27:51] thebakeriscomingforu: dragon riding is a more "active" form of flying. GW2 has something similar and it works well.
[1:28:04] RiptoreCA: WoWhead seems a little dead the last two days. Do we have any word on the DH tree or Beta or new build?
[1:28:04] abracka_: there are way too many flying mounts in the game to make them all have the dragon riding effect tbh
[1:28:16] thebakeriscomingforu: I'm sure it will be fine as folks get used to it in wow.

[1:28:35] Funderik: @abracka_ it wouldn't be dragonriding then, it would be mount riding and we already have that.
[1:28:44] Manjoe81: sun fire kick look so good on brewmaster
[1:28:57] Richadin: What Tank spec you like the most so far?
[1:29:08] Aquadriel: noticias falsas
[1:29:25] Tripnbunz: mammtoh
[1:29:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: That would have been badass, if a person had a mechano hog and the flag carrier jumped in the passenger seat
[1:29:26] Kinghorn: a bunch

[2:03:29] zzzeiden: for the person who were asking for an easy spec: bm hunter is definitely not the easiest as you have to keep certain buffs active all the time whereas other specs just mostly build and spend. also it has very high apm during wild spirits window. mm is by far the easiest hunter spec to play atm, you just have to press a single button to do everything
[2:03:30] jhajden: this expansion does look amazing though

[2:04:22] Scoodles91: press barbed shot requires skill
[2:04:26] albiejw: facerolling the keyboard is a skill
[2:04:28] wxlfvoid: It's hard to maintain the barb shot buff
[2:04:30] Xailen: BM is pretty brain dead easy to play
[2:04:36] zmr44: this a new copypasta ?
[2:04:52] doomkry: ww monk takes skill though
[2:04:59] Shrenko: how is that hard to obtain ?! @wxlfvoid
[2:05:01] xziyn: BM high APM, good one
[2:05:03] Hitcher_TV: Guys I’m new to the wow community who should I watch to better understand the game to help me enjoy it
[2:05:21] wxlfvoid: It just is they you have to really use you're mind and stuff it takes skill.
[2:05:24] xziyn: @Hitcher_TV Heard that guy Towelliee is quite an authority
[2:05:30] zgag: Zzz is right.  If you don't know how to keep up frenzy buff your dps will be lower than the BM hunters that do.  Also, pet AI can be pretty bad at certain fights and you need to know how to get around that.  There's a difference between a good and bad BM hunter
[2:05:34] paradoxyy: Cooking vendor,Dorado isle fish
[2:05:39] Hitcher_TV: Cause I feel @towelliee does a lot of end game stuff and not like newb stuff

[2:07:35] skilled_fragi: imagine that expansion coming out in 3 my nths and still no DH talents LUL
[2:07:45] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  he meant newbie stuff not noob stuff :P
[2:07:47] cabalish: i think he means the basics
[2:08:11] kay0234: You can always search up on youtube if you need help too
[2:08:13] aumixp: Do you like fishing in the alpha? 🤔
[2:08:19] cabalish: i'd say play the game have fun
[2:08:22] stabzmcgeee: imagine someone new to wow comes in here looking for help and y'all just flamed him
[2:08:25] Hitcher_TV: Any YouTubers to recommend @towelliee
[2:08:32] paradoxyy: I couldnt write one myself but there is surely one
[2:08:43] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Don't forget to give feedback on having gathering professions as secondaries.

[2:08:44] suprafreak98: suprafreak98 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:08:46] kay0234: I learned wow by myself just wandering around endlessly for days, eventually i figured it out

[2:08:48] onous_: Towelliee is the only streamer playing alpha. Of streamers playing alpha about 1% give honest actual feedback the rest it's straight content.
[2:08:51] Diecast669: listen to The Starting Zone podcast for noob tips
[2:08:56] Templexx: lmao

[2:09:25] wxlfvoid: wow lore LUL
[2:09:31] zzzeiden: @zgag you also have to manage your focus to keep beast cleave active (it's much easier with 4pc) and in alpha you also have to fit as much kill commands as possible in a 6 sec window. on the other hand, mm hunters have perma trick shots and press only aimed shot in every single scenario
[2:09:35] Rottencoarse: ah right hazel is there also
[2:09:36] Hitcher_TV: Alright thanks guys
[2:09:43] IchabodCrain: kraken latte is good
[2:09:47] wxlfvoid: Shadowlands had the best lore

[2:11:29] Tinit5190: You should just have to change the number
[2:11:38] zgag: @zzzeiden Yup. Just to maintain the full potential (dps) of a BM hunter I would agree that it does take more skill than playing a MM hunter
[2:11:59] paradoxyy: Yep,u change the number to the quest example 7 is islefin i think
[2:12:00] IchabodCrain: damn, shadowlands is only 35 rating
[2:12:03] zgag: Think that bad BM hunters gives BM a bad name
[2:12:04] Mecabeast: I remember they gutted the wrathion and ra-den haste trinkets going into shadowlands
[2:12:30] skymercii: so i already have the digital epic edition if i buy the physical box and do i get like bnet balance since i already own the epic edition ?
[2:12:33] xPockitzx: is it a good time to lvl/gear up in retail?
[2:12:36] zgag: Surv is also just 1-2 buttons and mega dps
[2:12:38] skymercii: @zgag i disagree
[2:12:41] paradoxyy: @Towelliee  change the number to the islefin quest and it should work

[2:13:06] skymercii: @zgag actually a good SV hunter will disagree with that
[2:13:07] paradoxyy: its 6
[2:13:12] Tinit5190: Change the (1) to a (6_
[2:13:18] Draz3nx: ban inc
[2:13:27] paradoxyy: yeah,u change the first number to quest 6 and it should be good
[2:13:34] doomester: @Towelliee didnt they do it once at the begining of the an expansion that ssecodory states were high?
[2:13:40] zgag: @bloodyreapr Surv hunter can do very little and will outshine a very good BM hunter
[2:13:49] Sollice: @Towelliee wait

[2:14:06] zgag: Same gear level and exp

[2:21:52] paradoxyy: @Eviltuna13 for gold making its lit af,for example
[2:21:53] cynricsaxon: still 8 weeks till the supposed pre-patch date not hard to iron out issues with that much time
[2:21:54] kaihole: fishing is useful now for food buffs.
[2:22:11] ZeroNpcTV: pre patch? when?
[2:22:15] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Will Evoker be in prepatch, or prepach event?
[2:22:19] Ertra: oh ok, thanks
[2:22:22] WarriorMuffins: Can you boost a envoker?
[2:22:39] Subjektive: they start at 58
[2:22:39] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Ion said there would be a 2 week prepatch event, and I'm guessing the prepatch will be 4 weeks or so?
[2:22:41] cynricsaxon: why would you boost evoker you start at 58
[2:22:44] Eviltuna13: @paradoxyy True even in Retail its a great money maker because alot of people dont fish
[2:23:00] Thoreya: was gonna go evoker but the mage changes look good so far lol
[2:23:03] Thoreya: so well see
[2:23:17] zeitgeiz: Hope the prepatch datamined catch up gear gets an ilvl increase. 252 is rough

[2:24:13] PrillaGorilla: @towelliee pre patch will be a perfect time to roll a tank. Nobody is going to be tanking.
[2:24:21] nightkok: poor barrens, it's literally always getting invaded

[3:29:35] epockite: does that break it for everyone?
[3:29:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ice fishing!!
[3:29:46] branbee: Incredible
[3:29:50] cappei: Oh wow, it's fishing. But totally different
[3:29:50] epockite: so like one person needs the pick but then others can fish with out the trait?
[3:29:51] Mecabeast: it's missing a little shack on the ice
[3:29:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: grumpy old men vibes
[3:29:52] Mr_Dusty: They need a fishing shack toy for ice fishing
[3:29:57] Shrenko: I just wish they changed up fishing abit for this expansion
[3:30:35] Coffenatic: Pog
[3:30:43] nightkok: damn that fish ate a deck of cards
[3:30:45] Molvonos: @Shrenko they've changed it entirely, i'm confused
[3:30:59] OrganicJKW: Fishing = S tier in DF.
[3:31:14] NewWorldReign: whats the new mining ores in DF?
[3:31:27] Animemron: I wish they would do something with archeology :(
[3:31:35] Connectus: 5 now
[3:31:37] cappei: Changed it entirely? I mean, it's the same boring click spell and wait. Not really much difference except for rewards, is it?
[3:31:44] Connectus: 6
[3:31:48] Shrenko: @Molvonos no I mean the way it works. Like you stay there and wait to click the lure. It feels abit outdated compared to other mmos that make it really fun now
[3:31:52] cappei: Or am I missing something
[3:31:53] abracka_: archaeology? never heard of it
[3:31:55] Connectus: 7
[3:32:03] OrganicJKW: Yeah, Archeology reeeeeeally missed the mark in DF. Perfect time for it to come back.
[3:32:06] Drizz_36: oh shit there's ice fishing? PogChamp
[3:32:09] ArchHere: What are your hopes for DH in Dragonflight?
[3:32:25] Artenuous: especially given all the titan lore going on in DF
[3:32:34] mayonaes: Sea Vine
[3:32:38] plaguedfirmware: Did they say no archaeology in DF at all or is there potential for something in a patch later on?
[3:32:38] Connectus: It seems to be time based and not charge based
[3:32:38] mayonaes: sevine
[3:32:40] Mecabeast: because the tortollans have stories that'll scare you shelless
[3:32:42] mayonaes: Kappa
[3:32:44] Shrenko: @Molvonos would be fun if they changed it up abit and made it more advanced than it is right now

[3:38:52] Molvonos: @Badziee They're only really expensive due to supply and demand.  Since everyone can fish, the demand's should be less, which will drive costs down
[3:39:06] RagingPunk: @Sollice lol
[3:39:27] Badziee: true, but not that many are into fishing

[3:51:52] KrimsonElite: KrimsonElite subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 71 months, currently on a 71 month streak! 1 month from my 6 years lets gooo
[3:52:06] GamingDad77: @Sollice out making that bank preparing for the release
[3:52:13] CraftyClaw: I do not get why they will not make all reps account wide
[3:52:29] HaloS23: @Towelliee the center of the screen deff goves the vibe of we are apart of your stream where the side one seems more after thought
[3:52:32] KrimsonElite: that was my fav sub notification you've had
[3:52:35] JokaThS: illidan was sick too
[3:52:44] KrimsonElite: The BFA ones where you could pick horde or alliance were sick too
[3:52:45] DallTV_: haii
[3:52:49] EKS90_: @CraftyClaw Cause its not just a flick of a button with their coding, it will take time but Ion said they are looking into doing it.
[3:52:56] Sollice: @HaloS23 Oh...none of the notifiers are after thoughts thats for sure the amount of work they put in
[3:53:04] cptlusciousbeard: personally I think its just not implemented yet
[3:53:44] HaloS23: @Sollice totally agree but more my point was the center felt more .. inclusive i guess
[3:53:47] EKS90_: I swear i heard in multiple interviews that the renowns were account wide, so Im thinking its just not implemented correctly yet.
[3:53:50] CraftyClaw: @CraftyClaw Well good to hear they are looking at it - I know it will take some time but if we could get a solid confirmation they are going to do it and if it will apply to all reps in the game that would be great.
[3:53:53] TheGiant99: Going to havbe my Tusaker fishing pole on a second toon in a few days

[3:54:39] Drizz_36: renown in dragonflight has some account wide elements, there are no plans to make old reps account wide as far as i know
[3:54:49] z0mbre: @MisterBongwater same xD
[3:54:49] mrniceguy817: What’s different from DF fishing compare to live haven’t really paid attention
[3:54:49] Jarlan23: what kinds of things can you fish up? can you get mystery crates from fishing like in classic?
[3:54:58] EKS90_: @CraftyClaw I think it was in mrGMs interview ion said they are looking into making legacy reps account wide cause it would make switching mains less of a hassle etc  Not 100% confirmation but atleast there was talk about it.
[3:55:04] TheGiant99: The artifact pole takes alot

[4:04:02] Connectus: I know, I'm using it now. Still running games on high in 1440p native resolution MingLee
[4:04:04] Connectus: It's amazing
[4:04:08] cptlusciousbeard: 1080 ti was the biggest power boost vs prior gen

[4:06:06] Sollice: @Towelliee That was more an issue with the Origin windows image
[4:06:13] Aidler: @mecabeast yeah, there are no tornadoes where I live but I remember when they tested the sirens for fire alarms in the past. they no longer do that nowadays
[4:06:20] Sollice: Once they fixed their image any new PC would have been fine
[4:06:24] procyon_mfc: it's better just to turn off your PC at night

[4:08:21] Sollice: @Towelliee From South Park movie
[4:08:21] Mufufu2988: Maybe don't buy crap PC's :D
[4:08:36] DPeachGaming: the only issues i usually get after an update is the microphone defaults change.
[4:08:47] BigHeroSixy: Windows update and it screws all your sound settings/mic/etc that was the worst one for me.

[5:11:32] Mmmarcoman: The addblock thing is real though, I don't mind Twitch adds at all, but at present time it depends on what browser I use, cause last year the guy who helps me with my pc maintenance was like- Do you want no yt adds? - Hell yeah.

[6:39:29] 1llum1n471: Player Housing offers 0 purpose or content to the game. Adding it in needlessly to satisfy a niche minority would be a waste of resources that could be better used elsewhere.
[6:39:34] luckfore: dh talents broke the game so they have to sadly remove dh from wow
[6:39:38] olyv12: I personally liked the garrison...
[6:39:39] MWilco77: their internal test environment just yacked it back up

[6:42:28] rsimpson105: if you wanna talk about housing, elder scrolls has a wiiild housing system imo

[6:55:26] Drizz_36: @Pr1m0x21, no reason to think they won't be, at least for pugs
[6:55:41] dreamwalker213: Exactly, most streamers are still maining their old servers
[6:55:48] wigardt: 90 days is way to low imo to get chars boosted there
[6:55:54] Tokesito: all tht shit is been plotted and designed to go down that path tho
[6:55:57] mozavich: fresh servers will become gdkp servers in about 1-2 months
[6:56:03] Tokesito: ez money for blizzard
[6:56:06] SilkeySmooth: so if lots of people stay on fresh there will be zero transfers?
[6:56:10] wigardt: @mozavich ^
[6:56:21] Wastingmoney: @mozavich 3 months at the latest KEKW
[6:56:32] mozavich: @Wastingmoney #doubt
[6:56:39] Keyastaron_: prepatch 6 days>
[6:56:48] Polatynez: Thats good new's! I always did enjoy you playing that game brother
[6:57:02] wakeandbacon95: looking forward to see how fresh servers turn out. gonna be fun to watch
[6:57:12] wigardt: Fresh server gonna be gdkp within 3 months and gonna be as fresh as a 65 + h00k3r
[6:57:20] notColt45: I hope they stay fresh, would be a cool experience for everyone playing them
[6:57:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: hope it works out for fresh long term, but i fear a few months in they will either die out or just become much like a regular server with all the bots
[6:57:23] dreamwalker213: @pr1m0x21 people are so addicted to GDKPs I wouldn’t be surprised if some sweat lords do gdkps for leveling dungeons LUL
[6:57:27] olyv12: When I return I'm def starting from scratch
[6:57:31] Keyastaron_: tuaren dk inc Kappa
[6:57:37] mozavich: @wigardt then once people buy all their gear, they quit, and it'll be dead.
