[2:39:00] geokouts: right now 1 and a hlaf hour before the day 2 less than 500 people are on hold to see it
[2:39:10] Masqerader: more people probably watched the Daisy bar this week than the MDI all season
[2:39:28] geokouts: 480 now
[2:39:28] Ambersulfr: I do not like YouTube either. I hate that you have no choice but to use the name on your Google account.

[2:40:59] SlayerLightStorm: They need to stop putting that shit on YT and just put it on Twitch. That'll save it. It worked for them a couple years ago, so, why fix it if it ain't broken?

[2:42:51] Masqerader: the other game they play is fucking hysterical
[2:43:04] Masqerader: the among us type game on the boat
[2:43:09] geokouts: Would Overwatch be f2p?
[2:43:10] 420fortnitefan: Just played a few rounds of enlisted. Fun as heck. Easy to get into

[4:02:11] enthroned1: poe lacks gameplay
[4:02:12] DrakhanGaming: lots of people dont care about stories with ARPGS
[4:02:14] Darzetti_: yea, diablo is about the lore and story behind it
[4:02:33] Sincline387: POE is free is like Mom saying "we got mcdonalds at home"
[4:02:33] happybooger: id rather pay for d4 than play poe

[4:05:32] xXSiebzehnXx: @enthroned1 idk why, but I got bored IMMEDIATELY
