[2:10:46] Moobot: Be on Discord. I will announce the giveaways as I play some Classic. Be active and be IN Twitch chat at time of winning.
[2:10:46] smashwow: the copy cost seems odd and a lot of money. but other than that. the only thing i could really see people getting pissed about is the pre-patch length. they said in the round table they'd give people plenty of time
[2:10:51] sthanopala: new bos when? :D
[2:10:52] Aravarth: Blizzard's gonna be like "What, you expect us to not like money?"
[2:11:04] RobinDePoppin: Chat what can i do on the Classic PTR currently?
[2:11:10] Thoreya: People put blizzard on this pedestal and act like they shud be the only gaming company not trying to make money when literally every other game genre including MMOs has cash shops and shit
[2:11:14] Thoreya: It’s honestly so weird
[2:11:15] thomaspxo: price is fine if you consider boost is minimum 60 us dollars plus 15 for gametkme

[2:11:44] thomaspxo: I'm broke on classic and haven't played since P1
[2:11:46] Phil87z: The wow community is just so negative these days. It’s exhausting
