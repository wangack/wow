[1:21:56] CallMeDoubleYou: you'd think this kinda stuff wouldnt happen after all these releases recently
[1:22:39] lazerlemons: The surge is short term, you don't invest heavily in a scaling solution unless it can either be a very short term cost or you expect demand to stay high

[1:23:09] CallMeDoubleYou: wow andys pray with us DinkDonk
