[7:10:39] Vapevillan: i started with that cov but after doing arenas for a while i had to switch to necro helps you live so much

[7:11:07] hamitbe: all my conduits are 252

[7:11:18] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[7:11:22] Twiello: swifty how come u go draven and not nadjia ?

[7:12:28] vanillasky7788: And whats so crazy about having all ur alts on252 at the end of the damn patch
[7:12:35] vanillasky7788: …
[7:12:43] Twiello: i feel ignored lol
[7:13:16] Hawdyha: Rift farm, possible to get 30k research an hour
[7:13:32] keknrekt: is hunter going to be good in pvp 9.2?
[7:13:49] Grsan_21: What is your favorite expansion ?
[7:14:03] Twiello: why did u go draven and not nadjia with ur covenant ?:D
[7:14:04] PandaSmuggl3r: Did you not like Lost Ark? Haven't watched you in a while.
[7:14:21] Unosojudio: has to crazy rng now way you can get that much in an hour
[7:14:24] Hawdyha: Yeah, there is a method where you use the engineering teleporter and a macro. Can look it up, there are a few videos on youtube with it
[7:14:47] danswann31: Wait till you realize you’re 40 item levels down:(
[7:15:07] theodrim: 252 item works smarter that 236 random one. So it will only upgrade conduits for your current spec (it's irrelevant for potency and endurance, but that's only 4).
[7:15:13] Hawdyha: You don't get that much, you get a  boost when you get to rank 6
