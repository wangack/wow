[0:12:49] Lythi: heyo Mes! great job by you guys today, gratz on top 3!
[0:13:10] Lythi: Cheers!
[0:13:22] Mahoneyy: ive been thinking about playing SoD, do you think its fun? @notmes
[0:13:29] dawsonator171: I made it to level 18 and lost interest again.
[0:14:01] VoK_Volcom: i got all the way from 29-40 on pure sm
[0:14:29] kkzam: shimmering flats?
[0:14:32] dawsonator171: i wanted to watch craig die.
[0:15:56] eMBeaR64oz: what are you tryin to solo for?
[0:16:07] eMBeaR64oz: i whispered it
[0:16:22] VoK_Volcom: 1k needles and shimmering flats are good for ur level
[0:16:23] eMBeaR64oz: there was like a hunter multibox and druid one, all casting same abilities at same time
[0:17:08] dawsonator171: did you ever get leggo to drop on live?
[0:17:15] americanmoses18: downed fyrakk heroic no wep :(
[0:17:15] eMBeaR64oz: what are you tryin to solo for?
[0:17:22] theodeth: Can you share your thoughts on the Le pomp vs gg game?
[0:17:24] Lythi: they killed craig man pwaffSad
[0:17:31] dawsonator171: @americanmoses18 SUCKS TO BE YOU!!!!
[0:18:24] Lythi: pretty sure he is yeah
[0:18:26] eMBeaR64oz: ret war fw though :O
[0:18:31] SwiisH_Tv: yeah him and JB both play warlock
[0:19:18] eMBeaR64oz: are we groupin for something btw? should i leave my sm one? just finished
[0:19:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Fistweaver embraces the zug SMOrc
[0:20:18] amnetv: that`s why unholy always sucks intofw
[0:20:31] dawsonator171: mes, are you using periwinkle cloak on TR|
[0:20:42] dawsonator171: have it in my vault, thinking about picking it up.
[0:20:45] sunileif: @americanmoses18 i heal raid with the leggo
[0:20:54] zachgamegodx: can swap to fdk hehe
[0:20:55] dawsonator171: mast/vers pve cloak
[0:21:11] buffevoker: Do you have answer for fw dewRage
[0:21:28] zachgamegodx: wow
[0:21:28] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:21:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah kiting seemed to be wrecking that monk
[0:22:31] dacrazy225: druid went oom too quick
[0:22:35] Lythi: it was super noticeable how much they started struggling when the monk was getting hit by more CCs
[0:22:52] dacrazy225: the mel cleave just swaps target loses hots
[0:23:08] Disemble: ive been struggling bad into fistweavers as shadow priest
[0:23:28] Lythi: RMD with subrogue might work as well if you can set up the oneshots properly
[0:23:36] amnetv: idk why they made this approach regarding FW
[0:23:39] amnetv: is kinda mehh
[0:23:54] zachgamegodx: @weirdo_dude disagree Monk never broke a sweat
[0:24:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sterge on rdruid was all over the place
[0:24:05] Lythi: latest point frost/destro no?
[0:24:20] SwiisH_Tv: i didnt get to watch it did The Move win a round at all?
[0:24:30] dacrazy225: god comp didnt work
[0:24:48] Vigi9413: that 2v2 today was insane mes
[0:25:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah frost does a lot of AOE stuff
[0:25:50] Disemble: that ret war fw team is so lame. so mongo
[0:26:07] buffevoker: Why isnt there alot More counter picks, do teams just usually prac just one comp
[0:26:13] Peachxp_: they legit perma 100% hp was so lame
[0:26:24] indithedog: Do u think mythic + has hurt the game class design wise cuz everyone gets homogenized omega aoe dam
[0:26:41] dawsonator171: I don't like xeek's teams strategy of singling out the FW and ccing it. I think they could have gotten more cds invested in each go and create a win condition.
[0:27:06] krome2dadome: the move should have used the “bigger man” strat
[0:27:33] amnetv: we need DK buffs asap
[0:27:37] Averyzan: Feel like they need to split mistweaver up into 2 specs. Maybe add a fistweaver support if they are going to keep aug.
[0:27:44] amnetv: ams/DS
[0:27:49] amnetv: defensive buffs
[0:27:49] SwiisH_Tv: in retail it feels like everything has everything and its bad
[0:27:54] SwiisH_Tv: lazy design
[0:27:54] amnetv: at least on s4 or next exp
[0:27:56] Lythi: dk just got nerfed LUL
[0:28:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: For season 4 there is likely to be a bunch of tuning, but that's still a ways off
[0:28:18] krome2dadome: u questing from here out?
[0:28:22] amnetv: @Lythi yep and we need compensation for the armor nerf
[0:28:51] buffevoker: Like this awc i think teams rarely switch their comp even if their down 0-2, like that void game kalvish waited for Last chance to change sub and then they just rolled
[0:29:05] SwiisH_Tv: They nerfed Evis twice tho
[0:29:17] SwiisH_Tv: once in a tuning before last
[0:29:36] zachgamegodx: subs still great
[0:29:38] zachgamegodx: imo
[0:29:39] amnetv: I mean if you check shuffle activity, we`re again the least represented class in the game
[0:29:40] SwiisH_Tv: yeah
[0:30:57] zachgamegodx: there was a guy in here on the night of those patch notes who was Adamantly   saying dks were fcked and mes was arguing that they’d be fine
[0:30:58] amnetv: I mean we got under 50% winrate in shuffle
[0:31:03] zachgamegodx: maybe we owe him an apology
[0:31:59] dawsonator171: imagine, killing fyrakk on heroic one time and getting a leggo @americanmoses18
[0:32:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah DK is not like C-tier now, it's just not meta anymore
[0:32:22] Lamatastisch: I still hope they buff DK in some way Sadge
[0:32:25] disquared: !wa
[0:32:25] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[0:32:31] amnetv: even on Ladder, I think DK is on one of the worst melees rn
[0:32:40] MonsterhunterP: why dont we see you on war more mes? seems like that class is not so bad atleast better than dk
[0:33:02] SwiisH_Tv: Dks and hunters always get the shaft for competitive play
[0:33:06] infraredpen: does the team have any comps yall wanna try with you on a different class? or just hoping dk's become more worthwhile?
[0:33:47] Lythi: ngl playing against hunters is one of the most frustrating experiences in the game
[0:35:23] SwiisH_Tv: They gave to much mobility to everything imo
[0:35:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure hunter can still rock, I liked watching Bicmex and The Fiends knock down Hoolibang with that thug cleave
[0:35:49] Lythi: its less about the damage, just the way they play in terms of mobility and cc, nothing is telegraphed, the kit basically forces you to play 100% reactionary.
[0:35:53] Disemble: the meta is just what can do extremely high damage while also being hard to kill. thats outlaw/dh/destro/demo right now
[0:36:03] eainzsp: more available information
[0:36:40] avenueone: sup mes
[0:36:41] amnetv: yeah, that`s where I had a shock in SL
[0:36:49] amnetv: after not playing since WoD
[0:37:18] amnetv: is kinda bad if you ask me
[0:37:24] amnetv: to limit diversity
[0:37:41] davErosEe: does eu have more dhs because they play more ele?  or more ele because they play less rogue
[0:37:45] buffevoker: Is Chuck going to hop in his fistweaver and you on beefdaddy
[0:37:52] zachgamegodx: well in legion you had a patch where outlaw x was insane and then a patch where jungle was crazy
[0:37:59] amnetv: I also hate that DK is nowadays  limited to ww/dh and dh/dk only
[0:38:10] Anhak: Kermit: Melee hunter might be busted 1 of them 1 shot me and almost 1 shot ave in a bunch of plate + shield tank etc etc
[0:38:41] avenueone: nah
[0:38:47] avenueone: those mats will push me across the line
[0:38:55] buffevoker: Have you tried any frost dk on this season
[0:39:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah that cupid cleave with hunter and ret seemed to do wild stuff
[0:39:06] avenueone: ill come to u
[0:39:30] TRVS12345: !wa
[0:39:31] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[0:39:47] avenueone: then u gotta go back
[0:39:49] Mortifiedwow: I hate to say this because I love when you get to cleave but I don't see a world where rogue isn't just the meta class. You have any plans to pick something up to incorporate with rogue?
[0:40:12] avenueone: yea a melee hunter hit me for 1k
[0:40:22] avenueone: w 4k armor
[0:40:23] nikthevoker: you can tell all the good healers are on shuffle LUL
[0:40:34] nikthevoker: are on sod^
[0:40:55] zachgamegodx: waiting in balance hot fixes in sod and retail
[0:41:55] nikthevoker: just had healers run away and die or run away and let me die just afk mid
[0:41:56] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[0:42:10] buffevoker: Hows mes get that cast bar so big i need his ui
[0:42:29] DentalDayum: what’d you guys think when “the move” got dropped earlier? dewC
[0:43:25] zachgamegodx: @dentaldayum I was happy about it
[0:43:28] nikthevoker: yup
[0:43:40] Anhak: Kermit: Any fisters?
[0:43:42] Triangulum: kaska<3
[0:44:11] avenueone: how u guys gonna go into ret warr fw
[0:45:01] Lythi: such a good song
[0:45:39] FlynnFluff: yal did great today!
[0:46:00] FlynnFluff: what do you think about the move getting knocked out
[0:46:21] DontDv8: what a sore looser
[0:46:22] SweatyDaniels: wow what a toxic loser if he not dc
[0:46:23] Disemble: you have unspent profession specialization knowledge.
[0:46:42] Vigi9413: that guy is 1500 playing at 2300
[0:46:45] DontDv8: i hate that about shuffle
[0:47:01] SweatyDaniels: as a healer, do you ever enjoy shuffle tho, its kinda what you sign up for
[0:47:27] avenueone: found a quest that gives u a lvl 50 leather chest
[0:47:36] avenueone: w 23 agi
[0:47:58] xiliketurtlex: @mes you know about unholy blight being bugged right now
[0:48:02] DontDv8: i never have fun in shuffle until the last game to know if i won or not
[0:49:13] amnetv: don`t you think unholy is kinda bad in shuffle after the nerfs?
[0:49:50] xiliketurtlex: yea kinda sketchy to use rm
[0:49:52] xiliketurtlex: rn
[0:50:14] FlynnFluff: what’s it do
[0:50:50] xiliketurtlex: ppl talk
[0:50:52] Ultramagnus85: unholy blight is bugged?
[0:50:57] amnetv: I found about it in shuffle when I broke a trap I shouldn`t
[0:51:33] Begasaur: hey hey
[0:51:54] Begasaur: not bad just grinding
[0:52:07] Begasaur: yea
[0:52:18] Begasaur: leveling my alliance druid atm
[0:52:24] freshdots321: does anyone want to do a normal raz skip?
[0:52:47] Begasaur: went from 1-30 in 1 sitting
[0:52:49] AkioneDK: hey mes what do you think what ability is better to play with legendery clawing shadows or  Scourge Strike ?
[0:52:50] amnetv: I think they just need to bump our survivability
[0:52:56] OVRO__: its weird they nerfed dk against physical when it already died hardcore to it
[0:53:10] amnetv: ye I feel like you`re not tanky into casters anymore
[0:53:30] amnetv: idk why DH is allowed to be passively tanky
[0:53:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ret has big heals and bubbles and such, to compensate for similar squishiness
[0:54:13] dilsnick: chaos bolt DS are nice
[0:55:12] AkioneDK: hey mes what do you think what ability is better to play with legendery clawing shadows or Scourge Strike ?
[0:57:38] amnetv: exactly my thoughts
[0:57:47] trickentender: yeah ive realized playing my UDK im so squishy even in full gear lmao
[0:57:57] amnetv: DH has passive 40% vers + lots of passive Damage reduction; on top of leech
[0:57:57] eainzsp: As your dk gets smashed into the dirt
[0:58:24] trickentender: melee in general besides rogue
[0:58:29] dilsnick: he's pu,ping
[0:58:34] dilsnick: pumping*
[0:58:37] GamerKrown: That DKs really good. He was teaching me at start of season, like 2.7cr in europe atm
[0:58:39] trickentender: i literally always see the same classes in awc lol
[0:59:24] nikthevoker: how many DSs
[0:59:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I likeed that suggestion of buffing will of the necropolis back up
[1:00:33] Vigi9413: hey mes can you link your talents for DH?
[1:01:54] Aurnilon: does mes have a ui video?
[1:03:39] Aurnilon: wait I missed it do you have a UI pack?
[1:03:39] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[1:04:30] Ashmeedel: Oooh mes dh
[1:04:31] AkioneDK: typical dk lobby XD
[1:04:33] dawsonator171: Imagine trying to play dk at higher ratings.
[1:05:15] AkioneDK: problem is it doesnt even help to get like 38% versality
[1:05:52] xiliketurtlex: think max vers you can get with tier is like 37 38 vers
[1:06:07] xiliketurtlex: when war can easily tap 40 vers lol
[1:06:21] dawsonator171: I have a zero tier set for lobbies where I'm scared at nearly 50.
[1:06:35] dawsonator171: DK has plenty of natural damage.
[1:07:20] xiliketurtlex: some dev got crushed by dk in bg and just unleashed wrath of hate
[1:08:28] nikthevoker: deev/dh bis just full mongo LUL
[1:08:44] eainzsp: seems like windwalkers are sleeper good this awc. do you think you’d pick it up? I know you have trillm
[1:08:53] AkioneDK: they need to give blood and unholy stance back ^^
[1:09:17] AkioneDK: so you can swap like warr
[1:09:38] ItsYaBoyOOH: is dk fried again?
[1:10:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure being able to switch to frost presence was awesome, much like warriors have with their defensive stance
[1:11:01] AkioneDK: yeah frost and unholy stance^^
[1:11:08] shoal3: dk in solo is fine
[1:11:31] AkioneDK: if not getting focused^^
[1:12:19] amnetv: @shoal3 contrary, I think DK sucks in shuffle, but is better in 3s
[1:12:31] shoal3: i mean the stats disagree with you
[1:12:36] shoal3: they are objectively fine
[1:12:44] shoal3: unholy anyway
[1:12:49] Anhak: the stats dont say its fine
[1:12:53] amnetv: I mean there aren`t much dks queuing 2.4+ anymore
[1:12:59] Anhak: the stats say it fell more then 5 % in win rate
[1:13:07] Anhak: and is still falling
[1:13:21] Lythi: i´m just glad i got my 1.8k for the transmog while dk was on top dgaSeemsgood
[1:13:22] amnetv: ye, check stats, and you see DK 2nd most reped class in shuffle at 2.4+ but all of them are pre nerf
[1:13:50] amnetv: in shuffle DK sucks because the little healing DS does, it gets affected by the ultra damp from shuff
[1:14:11] AkioneDK: so lets write a ticket for blizzard so they give us our stances back ^^
[1:14:16] ItsYaBoyOOH: yeah dk dam ain’t all that great and survivability sucks
[1:14:41] Vigi9413: !wa
[1:14:41] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[1:14:45] davErosEe: shuffle is pvp raiding, best pumpers will always be good
[1:15:02] ItsYaBoyOOH: a dot class but the dots aren’t great. pet class but all pet dam is nerfed
[1:15:22] mercuryxedo: !addons

[1:15:58] dawsonator171: isn't feral down there too?
[1:16:27] Aurnilon: feral is only good in high elo
[1:16:28] Vigi9413: which Sarena are you using mes?
[1:16:39] nikthevoker: noone ccs or kicks heals tho
[1:16:40] amnetv: @mes why do you think we got our Necro wounds nerfed? I feel that hurts the most esp when we`re with a caster, vs another ms team
[1:16:44] davErosEe: there’s also not as many rogues in shuffle, so the classes that die to rogue do better
[1:16:53] nikthevoker: how much was it nerfed
[1:17:20] Alerothan: @nikthevoker Does it surprise you to see devestation that low winrate? I swear people keep saying Dev is OP lol
[1:17:29] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[1:17:34] amnetv: but I don`t get the reason why they would do this
[1:17:50] nikthevoker: alot of people dont know how to play with dev so not really
[1:17:52] Alerothan: I dont mean low as in bad I mean low as in what people say about Dev being too good
[1:17:56] nikthevoker: esp caster lobbys
[1:18:57] amnetv: @notmes check EU DK winrate
[1:19:13] amnetv: is worse KEKW
[1:19:21] Anhak: not fine KEKW
[1:20:23] sunileif: hmm buff bottom line
[1:20:31] nikthevoker: noone plays aug NA
[1:20:33] eainzsp: make frost great again
[1:20:34] amnetv: none plays aug
[1:20:42] Lythi: i´ve not seen an aug in the last month
[1:20:53] amnetv: yep, there`s literally jsut one Fdk that plays
[1:20:58] buffevoker: Is Frost Dk a sleeper spec
[1:21:00] dawsonator171: feral has to be just a couple of players tbh.
[1:21:05] amnetv: Engal guy is the only Fdk in EU
[1:21:07] sunileif: hmm nerf rogues
[1:21:19] nikthevoker: bean has been repping the feral grind
[1:21:22] sunileif: rogue should be bottom  tier all considering
[1:22:23] amnetv: in S3 they nerfed again before tournaments haha
[1:22:46] laha1n: blizzard just doesnt care, they overnerf one particular class and seem to completely leave untouched the problem classes
[1:22:55] poroyou: its a dick way to say it
[1:23:01] poroyou: but it sucks when your class is dumpstered
[1:23:03] sunileif: hmmm udk was top raid dps tier 1 n 2
[1:23:15] sunileif: maybe they figure at least you got that?
[1:23:28] VoK_Volcom: wizk got demolished today
[1:23:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shadow priest has tank cooldowns like dispersion
[1:24:24] poroyou: You multiclass, no?
[1:24:25] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[1:24:30] jexx1337: @wEiRdO_dUdE yea but you cant do anything when dispersed
[1:24:39] nikthevoker: what about hpal into fister
[1:24:55] sunileif: hmmm what if you had an arcan mage free castign to back you up?
[1:25:14] amnetv: do we have any decent comp as unholy for ladder?
[1:25:25] sunileif: @amnetv ya reroll
[1:25:35] dawsonator171: remember when mes and the boys were the cleave kings?
[1:25:39] dawsonator171: those were good days.
[1:25:53] dawsonator171: DK/BM is still decent too I think
[1:25:55] eainzsp: rogue ww seems really good
[1:26:00] dawsonator171: just not as popular as previous.
[1:26:02] poroyou: I started following you guys when it was DK/WW
[1:26:04] poroyou: that was fun
[1:26:14] amnetv: Did we got the unholy nerfs, because DH DK was too good? so kinda the same as frost last season ?
[1:26:39] krome2dadome: like 8 bars till whirlwind @notmes ;)
[1:26:49] dawsonator171: my favorite comp of all time was boomkin/DK clear back in cata days.
[1:27:08] dawsonator171: we would literally farm pets until people raged quit.
[1:27:09] amnetv: but why not nerf DH which is super oppressive ?
[1:27:17] Lathrien: Data also points to DH needing nerfs but they weren't hit as hard
[1:27:22] amnetv: we ate the nerf because DH was good
[1:27:48] Lathrien: THey got away scot-free
[1:28:00] Lathrien: Despite having a lot of similar problems, while being tankier and more mobile
[1:28:04] Lathrien: (as DK)
[1:28:13] sunileif: ya nerf dh, give them 4 more buttons to press for a total of 6
[1:28:28] jexx1337: What level do you start SM?
[1:28:43] Magottx: Afflic FeelsBadMan
[1:29:07] mrluke46: @sunileif i think dh has more buttons than fdk tho dont know why everyone flames dh buttons
[1:29:11] poroyou: You're one of my favorite players in the professional scene, I like Sam but I want to see you out there again, I hope they fix this stuff
[1:29:23] Devcomz: Please correct me if I am too bias but it just seems DH is just too much and even in Shuffle I am honestly tired of the Double Dh lobbies. It has gotten bad enough I have experienced an awful triple Dh lobby
[1:29:38] drahzin: !wa
[1:29:38] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[1:29:55] dawsonator171: DK caster comps could make a comeback at some point in time. We haven't seen DK/Demo do good in some time.
[1:30:01] amnetv: "Frost DK was good under specific circumstances" here, take the nerf hammer
[1:30:09] laha1n: yeah but its not melee caster
[1:30:11] poroyou: seems like Plate is just out now though
[1:30:12] laha1n: its rogue caster
[1:30:23] Ey_an: nah melee meta plus some melee+caster would be bis viewership numbers i'd bet
[1:30:27] Ey_an: people like watching melee
[1:30:29] amnetv: @dawsonator171 I`d love to play sp/affl dk
[1:30:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Brewmasters LUL
[1:30:54] krome2dadome: make cleaves great again
[1:31:02] sunileif: sounds better than world of roguecraft
[1:31:04] dawsonator171: mes have we taken another shot at getting your ret a leggo this week?
[1:31:04] Devcomz: I did like watching that HPriest Sub Rogue ww monk EU team that on EU I was actually having a fun time watching them
[1:31:08] Ey_an: 4 casters is the worst by far
[1:31:09] poroyou: I mean I play mage, so I don't want to see casters out completely, but the deep damp meta isn't actually super fun
[1:31:15] sunileif: or that shit rmpfest in sl
[1:31:20] eainzsp: double cleave double fw would be so hilarious
[1:31:22] Lathrien: Average rating of top 50 DH is 2669, 65 rating higher than the second best arcane at 2604, while the other specs are close behind
[1:31:28] Lathrien: For 3v3
[1:31:30] Senzn_: do you think they should implement a rule for only melee/caster comps?
[1:31:43] krome2dadome: only thing consistent with tourney meta since i've started pvping has been rogue and warlock
[1:31:53] sunileif: nooo tell us more bitterness
[1:32:10] kone_malone: !bracket
[1:32:10] StreamElements: https://raider.io/events/awc-dragonflight-season-3-cup-1-north-america/brackets/open-bracket
[1:32:46] mrluke46: what do you think would be a good fix for rdruid? something about power shifting or if about clone what would you change?
[1:32:51] poroyou: maybe we just know too much now
[1:32:51] Lathrien: They've been doing a decent job nerfing the OP specs but done a bad job of boosting the underperformers, and that hasn't changed from previous expacs
[1:32:55] dawsonator171: nah. this expansion sucks. too much farming to make crafted gear just to tweak stats, and untweakble tier is no fun either.
[1:33:11] Anhak: i think rdruid
[1:33:17] nemeuxs: it was a chill exspansion and i enjoyed blizzards activness. WOuld love to see their design departments start working together for class fantasy
[1:33:21] Anhak: is op
[1:33:23] sunileif: i will look back and be like thats when rogues were op in "thisway" and never got nerfed
[1:33:27] Anhak: starsurge is criting for 1.5 k
[1:33:29] Anhak: and almost 1 shotting
[1:33:37] dawsonator171: boost me anhak
[1:33:41] dawsonator171: because im lazy
[1:33:56] Anhak: im not a mage dawson
[1:34:01] nemeuxs: rdruid design does seem great
[1:34:12] dilsnick: MW FW today
[1:34:18] dawsonator171: actually, i just want a damned summon to get starsurge. such a long walk to wetlands.
[1:34:40] Anhak: daws
[1:34:47] icyyyspicyyy: mw def making a killing in rbgs
[1:34:48] Anhak: buy a summon ill pay for it
[1:34:51] Anhak: iof its 3 gold
[1:34:52] Anhak: ill pay it
[1:34:55] Anhak: 1 gold ill pay it
[1:34:57] icyyyspicyyy: double mw is everyone’s dream
[1:34:57] HeffaBear: @dawsonator171  HUH real take?
[1:35:40] mrluke46: do you not think that healers should get shorter cds on cc immunities and more own cc (besides rdruid) to make healing more attractive
[1:35:52] poroyou: I do think overall the expansion is good
[1:36:01] dawsonator171: I'm just angry all the time.
[1:36:02] Ey_an: dragonflight my fav expansion ever
[1:36:05] poroyou: you get paid to do this, your professional
[1:36:08] dawsonator171: like the hulk without turning green.
[1:36:10] poroyou: you're*
[1:36:30] Ey_an: i normally quit after s1 of every expansion still playing this one
[1:36:55] poroyou: big same
[1:42:07] thepartyzone: @notmes Hardstuck 2.1-2.2 as lfg gamer what’s the best comps to push glad with so I can be done
[1:42:38] thepartyzone: when is peak time
[1:43:18] mrluke46: how long is the season lasting like 7 weeks from now?
[1:43:43] thepartyzone: @notmes thanks for the words of wisdom / encouragement
[1:44:50] thepartyzone: at least April imo because 10.2.6 comes out in March and they will release ptr then
[1:44:51] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[1:44:55] thepartyzone: @mrluke46
[1:45:54] mrluke46: @thepartyzone thanks!
[1:45:58] thepartyzone: Do you think we get more tuning after awc @notmes
[1:46:49] reavethederp: i dont like that nulifying shroud is in the game
[1:47:11] Daydash_Gaming: how about that the move upset. you see anything that they did specifically to dominate them
[1:47:12] amnetv: do you think we`ll see more tuning in S4 ?
[1:48:05] Nemenon: tuning can just be good for keeping things fresh
[1:48:23] Nemenon: yea they did way too much tuning in a short amount of time
[1:48:38] thepartyzone: i don’t think the games in a bad state I enjoy it currently tbh I just hate outlaw feels to oppressive
[1:48:49] Lathrien: They have tuned some specs out of relevance. Feral, enhance, aug
[1:49:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Death to aug!
[1:49:36] dawsonator171: fuck you mes, I love aug.
[1:49:46] thepartyzone: melee caster is better to watch .. just not rdruid mana games
[1:49:54] Vigi9413: did they remove aug?
[1:50:04] brincubus: what about aug is bad?
[1:50:12] Lathrien: Aug as it existed wasn't good, which instead of re-working they nerfed to a potato spec
[1:50:24] davErosEe: I like watching games when someone can die before 5 min.
[1:50:31] thepartyzone: by melee caster I don’t mean caster rogue
[1:50:55] amnetv: I think class homogenization
[1:50:56] Nemenon: do you mean when comps were more versatile and people could focus on just one?
[1:51:03] thepartyzone: facts
[1:51:09] amnetv: in MoP/WoD everyone had heals, damage etc
[1:51:41] zachgamegodx: mes super short stream right?
[1:52:22] thepartyzone: I think self sustain and tankiness added to everyone was bad
[1:52:50] zachgamegodx: does that mean we won’t be seeing the great Chuck tn bc war games
[1:53:07] amnetv: @thepartyzone I think that was good actually
[1:53:38] thepartyzone: nah man I remember when they removed recuperate because a heal every 3 seconds was “to op”
[1:54:01] zachgamegodx: oh what have you got going on tonight?
[1:54:03] zachgamegodx: just sleep
[1:54:21] zachgamegodx: oh gotcha
[1:54:44] zachgamegodx: the liquid streams are sick
[1:55:14] thepartyzone: do you think dk dh is still solid @notmes
[1:56:06] JNOFI: What is that arrow shot sound? where's it comingh from
[1:56:42] Ephixza: I think they should nerf gap closing abilities to the ground if they would want to make the game more skilled and less mongo
[1:57:23] Ephixza: yes from both sides, whether to escape or to attack etc.
[1:58:20] dawsonator171: I love speed
[1:58:58] Ephixza: i dont mind 30 min 2s game as long as its skilled based.
[1:59:00] zachgamegodx: got a prediction on best classes for that season of discovering your g
[1:59:06] dawsonator171: bless you erin
[1:59:07] zachgamegodx: tourny
[1:59:39] freshdots321: Hope you feel better
[1:59:44] JNOFI: How can I get the same shot sounds as you? Addon or WA?
[2:00:03] JNOFI: Name? :D
[2:00:24] Caehwynu: maybe cynical thinking, but i think wow pvp is doomed at this point
[2:00:25] freshdots321: Watching hunter use mana so weird for me lol

[2:05:24] Anhak: vanq and then serenity would be my guess?
[2:05:35] Anhak: or vanq and wsg?
[2:06:26] Anhak: i wont play melee hunter on my alt i can 100% guarentee that one
[2:06:50] Begasaur: yeah seems like people are using vanq and WSG  weapons
[2:07:07] nikthevoker: just gotta find whats OP for duel tourney LUL
[2:07:46] Anhak: u can get scatter but if ur melee u just play 40 points bm or 40 point surv
[2:08:16] Anhak: yea and then pet stun too not as good as catter but
[2:08:21] Semis394: are you guys top3? didnt get to watch today

[2:36:27] dawsonator171: people think draco cleave has some scary shit, but I have the spookiest shit cooked up.
[2:36:44] Vigi9413: they need to bring awc back to blizzcon at end of season for a LAN
[2:37:21] verii: If it was beneficial to lose to keep the move out would you
[2:37:53] sunileif: the move is already out

[2:39:34] Anhak: but also unethical as fuck and if blizzard finds out probably way bad
[2:39:35] Vigi9413: is the top 3 the only way to avoid the gauntlet?
[2:40:02] verii: @anhak not sure about that. It's pretty common in other games
[2:40:18] Anhak: @verii what games?
[2:40:37] rocka10388: Amazing support! <3

[2:44:32] verii: @anhak can't ban a team for playing a bad comp or one player not showing up
[2:44:44] gaulois62: @notmes plz mes i really need aanser i have been trying to figure it out but cant seems to find any option to make arena 1 2 3 bigger number wise...
[2:44:48] terranapart: Destro, SP?
[2:44:53] infernion: Dh destro rsham kinda counters fw atm
[2:45:14] Anhak: @verii i mean they can? they can ban someone for whatever reason they want. its just whether they will in that instance
[2:45:25] infernion: You can just remove the fw from the game with fear fear fear hex etc. But ye outlaw prolly even better. Just wonder if outlaw has the damage to kill, dh definitely does
[2:45:26] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[2:45:34] terranapart: So destro, Sham, healer?
[2:45:55] sngtokos: Hey chat come some1 tell me how to get AB rep from STV? i don't see the lumber from daily
[2:45:57] infernion: Sp sounds awful into fw
[2:46:04] infernion: Destro is lowkey kinda good into fw atm I feel
[2:46:22] freshdots321: attack that guy!
[2:46:31] infernion: Yea you cancel if CC is ready/drs
[2:46:46] infernion: But you kinda chain your infernal out of your CC, so you don't end up cancelling it early at least
[2:46:52] infernion: Infernal damage is irrelevant if fw has 100% uptime
[2:47:24] infernion: The stun is crazy op and can force all cds in the opener if you chain it
[2:47:25] DjRio: his their an addon to see cast bars

[2:52:05] terranapart: No wonder "m seeing a lot of people doing scarlet monastery
[2:52:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think some of the speed levelers were like farming respawns but those areas are likely crowded now
[2:52:52] krome2dadome: i think we're gonna do it in a bit w/ her
[2:53:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: They say some of those BFD items are good until the next raid, too

[3:00:54] terranapart: I'm hearing the raid is actually hard
[3:00:59] Solushun: retail too fun to stop
[3:02:00] Solushun: arena lightbulb finally starting to go off lol
[3:02:06] Solushun: now if rdruid gets nerfed then its as different story kekw
[3:02:11] arcangelprotections: yea when you get on hunter off main event stuff u seem to be relaxed lol
[3:02:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: I watched a little of the race to world first people doing Gnomer, and yeah I think for most people the new raid is going to be hard at first
[3:02:18] arcangelprotections: ^_^
[3:02:21] proxyr6x: What's the strongest pvp class in phase 2 so far
[3:03:23] Anhak: i know what you just said too
[3:03:28] Anhak: it the reason for a guild rule :)
[3:03:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: strongest PvP class is a good question
[3:03:54] terranapart: @proxyr6x priest/boomie, but might still be too early
[3:04:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: With the new runes and books, things could shift around some, and yeah we could see the rise of boomkins
[3:05:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Like some of the paladin runes, like art of war, could be game changers for them
[3:06:11] MaybeRespect: @wEiRdO_dUdE Is it good? Thought exo was bad
[3:06:12] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:06:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember how crazy shockadin could be in original Wrath, if these give them that kind of power, look out
