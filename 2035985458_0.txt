[0:20:01] AlagaesiaXfers: Where it gets overwritten with other ms and you can't get full stacks
[0:20:16] Roadskii: In my opinion I think Rogues and Monks are the more difficult classes to master and play really well in WoW. Seems like especially for rogues that their are either good or bad rogues and not much in-between

[0:22:22] Safesage: why the axe?
[0:22:38] Safesage: ah ok
[0:22:49] AlagaesiaXfers: Ok sure but we should be able to get our 36 eventually with other ms classes
