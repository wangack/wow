[0:46:56] Lemon_King: Smother that in poutine
[0:46:59] xXSiebzehnXx: avocado oil has a low smoke point though. at 450 might be too high for avocado oil
[0:46:59] sponx: At this point is it really that much more work to just add oil to a pot, deep fry and then filter the oil afterwards?

[0:48:32] sponx: For me if I am making fries for more than 2 people the oven is better, 2 or less then the air fryer is goated
[0:48:32] Yurian33: Bacon in oven is BIS
[0:48:34] Lemon_King: cook the fries in the bacon oil
[0:48:42] SwivalChair: @sponx true, I’ve just had better results with my conventional oven

[1:18:01] Oviedange: @FrankTheTank1988 Won't matter.  Max posted a video, so the fanboys will vote the same way he did in his youtube video.  The votes jumped like 2-3k since he made the video.
[1:18:29] FrankTheTank1988: yeah thats whats gonna happen, big streamers/ytbers gonna influence the vote for what they prefer.
[1:18:33] FrankTheTank1988: cough asmongold cough.....
[1:18:35] Daemoos6: Did Lux invite Gummybear by mistake again? Kappa
[1:18:44] FrankTheTank1988: not sure why blizz thought voting for it was a good idea. LUL
[1:19:13] Reveran: well did people look up the video from Max?
[1:19:14] sponx: I thought people already learned from Boaty McBoatface
[1:19:15] skippyskip89: voting hant been a troll really its actually been going well
[1:19:30] skippyskip89: hasnt**
[1:19:34] shale93: its actually weird that you can vote on the class if you have at least lvl 10 on it
[1:19:39] Oviedange: People will vote based on Nostalgia or based on 1 content type (Raid, M+, PVP)
[1:19:48] shale93: it should have been only 70 can vote on the class
[1:19:49] StudioCM: hey i did say learning lol
[1:20:11] Masqerader: pi the dh
[1:20:24] joe_suff: People were voting on the WW set for PvP lul
[1:21:25] Fuzziew: PVP is still in the game???

[1:21:31] joe_suff: Aren't all 3 raids supposed to be out next season? Let us get all 3!!
[1:21:38] taibox: just let each person choose which tier set they want
[1:21:43] kybacca_: luxthoBlankies

[1:22:12] FrankTheTank1988: thats only sets being voted on
[1:22:23] FrankTheTank1988: not All of em luxthoKEK
[1:22:26] Fuzziew: Make all the tier sets from this xpack part of the talent tree. Pick what you want
[1:22:30] Reveran: @FrankTheTank1988 im responding to the idea of lux
[1:23:01] Reveran: People need to check the video from maximum... they could have a better idea
[1:23:14] FrankTheTank1988: yeah aint that what he said tho, just let ppl select any of the sets (like pvp wont necesarily need same set as pvers)
[1:23:23] RalgorStreams: so maybe hot take incoming, but the wealth of information we have now has REALLY shifted how a lot of us play MMO’s not all bad just a comment
[1:23:32] FrankTheTank1988: no matter who wins in the votes one camp is gonna be unhappy D:
[1:23:48] Reveran: that's true frnak
[1:23:59] RalgorStreams: when I started playing EQ in 2001 and wow in wrath, nobody really cared. it was all about exploration and fantasy etc.

[1:28:01] RalgorStreams: what they just left everything broken?
[1:28:29] RalgorStreams: I think as long as it’s not broken for 6 months it’d be ok. like if it was 6 weeks or something

[3:34:03] Khadgarlic: luxthoKEKW
[3:34:20] sacrilege_69: did you kill the Lich king on classic?
[3:34:29] Voidthos: I don't even know what the endgame loop is for SWTOR lol
[3:34:59] Devildriver007: isn't there like loads of expacs with story content in SWTOR?
[3:35:07] Sarocus: @Voidthos There are some raids, but they are kinda meh
[3:35:07] Voidthos: Oh yeah, that sounds like ESO lol
[3:35:08] biirrd: its was so good back in 2011

[3:36:32] StreamElements:  Enjoying the stream? Considering subscribing to support: https://www.twitch.tv/subs/luxthos
[3:36:45] Voidthos: Yeah games like ESO and SWTOR strike me as side MMOs, go hard on them for a bit then peace
[3:36:50] Angryfist40: wish eso didnt have the whole skill canceling thing
[3:36:58] biirrd: I had so fun raiding in swtor back in the days.. the bosses was so good. and the raid i still remember them today.
[3:37:41] Khadgarlic: All those wow killer mmo with out of date engine
[3:37:49] Voidthos: @Angryfist40 I thought they got rid of that, there isn't weaving or it's super diminished
[3:38:32] Angryfist40: @Voidthos they did but the 1% got them to bring it back from what i heard
[3:38:48] Voidthos: Huh, interesting
[3:41:01] Thovarisk: i'm good with GW2 lol no time for anyone else in my mmorpg time
[3:41:08] Sarocus: To me, ESO i a collector's/completionist' MMO
[3:41:23] Velashen: To actually request that awful combat.. phew. ESO would be so much better with combat that didn't feel like you were fighting in mud.
[3:41:27] Voidthos: @Sarocus ESO and GW2 have very similar feels to me
[3:41:30] Aggy: I am freeeeeee
[3:41:31] Voidthos: For that reason
[3:41:32] StreamElements:  Proudly caffeinated by ADVANCEDgg! Use code "LUXTHOS" at advanced.gg/?ref=luxthos to get 35% OFF your order! My current favorite flavors are: Peach Tea, Mango Jalapeno, Tiger Blood!
[3:41:43] Velashen: GW2 combat is actually fun though.
[3:42:03] Aggy: Prepping for my daughter's birthday
[3:42:41] Aggy: Snowstorm kind of ruined the plans of my husband's family to attend this year so less food to make, but my daughter is sure gonna be disappointed
[3:43:03] Vahs_Redclaw: gw2 best pvp out there
[3:43:05] Voidthos: Floaty, yeah
[3:43:29] Lemon_King: Rigid
[3:43:46] h311yeadav: yes
[3:43:51] BlizzMarkc: ESO for sure, the hits feel so disconnected
[3:43:55] MadEquinox: what do you mean when you say floaty?
[3:43:56] h311yeadav: ok
[3:43:58] Voidthos: None of them are as bad as LOTRO combat though KEKW
[3:44:02] StreamElements:  Did you miss one of the playthroughs or would like to watch it again? The new channel Luxthos Plays is now live -> https://www.youtube.com/@luxthosplays
[3:44:06] MadEquinox: I dont understand the term
[3:44:08] Lemon_King: ESO is the worst imo, combat feels super soft and disconnected/
[3:44:27] Velashen: Like you are fighting someone in a swimming pool lol
[3:44:35] Velashen: GW2 is pretty snappy.
[3:44:47] MadEquinox: Ahh, thanks
[3:45:18] chinaman900: @Luxthos At what point do you think wow should end
[3:45:26] Velashen: Yeah wow does it best no doubt.
[3:45:28] MadEquinox: Ahh I understand now, makes sense
[3:45:34] Finiin: wow still has the best combat, I think GW2 is probably the next best
[3:45:36] Aggy: in ff14 its actually a skill you need to have to slide while casting lUL
[3:45:43] princesstrunks996: heyo all
[3:46:14] Velashen: FF14 is a different style. You get animation locked more. ESO  imo just feels like bad design.
[3:46:33] Voidthos: FF14 is a very traditional tab-target system, like WoW used to be before they innovated on it a bit
[3:46:38] Voidthos: SWTOR is between the two
[3:46:52] Voidthos: Then you have action-combat games like ESO/GW2 which have slight tab-targetting behind the scenes
[3:47:40] Voidthos: Then full action combat games like BDO and TARA (rip)
[3:47:49] Voidthos: TERA
[3:47:51] Voidthos: Tera..
[3:47:56] Voidthos: jfc I'm taking a nap
[3:48:01] Finiin: is Tara still around?
[3:48:09] Finiin: Tera
[3:48:12] Voidthos: I *think* the servers closed last year
[3:48:22] Lemon_King: Ohh
[3:48:50] Finiin: I miss Rift, it wasn’t the best. but I enjoyed it
[3:48:55] MadEquinox: Looking for your opinion Lux. I am an aging player who loves wow. Always played shadow priest but my reaction times and the ability to deal with a lot of button pushing has diminished. I am going to start fresh/re-roll. Wanted your opinion for an old dude on what class to play. I play casually, LFR/normal raids. M+ 10 or less.
[3:48:59] xmedpakx: extra dmg to demons
[3:49:02] mccrackasaur: I think that weapon is only second to the leggo
[3:49:12] sandecharlie1992: what weapon do u got now ?
[3:49:33] Ronangic: BM Hunter
[3:49:41] GrimGoreRMW: ^
[3:49:42] Velashen: Yeah, Rift had something special. Wildstar as well. Great combat.
[3:49:54] Finiin: as a older guy myself, BM Hunter is the way to go
[3:49:54] BlizzMarkc: Wildstar was so weird XD
[3:49:57] snuskedven: why not unholy?
