[0:12:57] Skyc0: Sounds like the quality is lower.
[0:13:01] Sebleh: wait this is what your wireless mic sounded like when you first put it on on Friday
[0:13:13] Sebleh: remember we were talking about reverb after you fixed the volume?

[0:17:04] Bob34210: do OBS have a enhancing mode for the mic?
[0:17:51] b0vril: Yeah, this sounds like stream is getting your headphone mic or something.
[0:17:58] Sebleh: Double check that your mic isn’t duplicated on OBS.
[0:18:17] b0vril: Also Naguura, how did the pie turn out?
[0:18:30] TotallyNotRaien: if you cover your mic does it do anything to the audio? if it doesnt then it should be your headset mic right?
[0:18:34] Sebleh: obs has a setting where it wants to take a default input for your mic so if you add it manually afterwards it takes the mic in twice.
[0:18:50] Kuroz: hmmMeeting

[1:12:37] Justflux: or is it just for healthstones and being tanky
[1:12:38] MBG_95: im convinced they are doing first part with dps and swapping to healer during the maze run
[1:12:49] Kuroz: they were playing destro with a healer
[1:12:51] Sebleh: @MissSpank Yeah for sure and you get a megasettWicked story out of it
[1:12:54] MBG_95: or maybe after morchie
[1:12:56] Kuroz: before they swapped the healer out
[1:13:12] OldManHeph: Incredible class variance in those trials
[1:13:36] Zirconn__: good morning Caro, chat naguuraHypers
[1:13:36] Sebleh: I was thinking the same thing.
[1:13:43] secklar: time for nagony
[1:13:46] Sebleh: For Rise? Doesn't the last boss chunk?
[1:14:00] Sebleh: The double dragons after Tyr and the last boss IMO
[1:14:01] speedsterox: !specc
[1:14:02] MBG_95: not for last boss? its a good 100k-150k+ hps from a healer on a 23
[1:14:09] Sebleh: Everything else can probably be done without a healer.
[1:14:21] Zirconn__: fall bc chromie will die probably
[1:14:21] Lenietwitch: i mean ifthey all go dwarf / mass dispel, you dont need a helear imo, you can cover all mandatory "healing mechanics" xD

[1:15:10] Lenietwitch: warlock no need for heals, mage barrers, sp can seflheal a lot and also off heal, evoker, lots of offheals
[1:15:17] Gamerhcp: Do you think there will be dungeon tuning after mdi
[1:15:24] Sebleh: No because RIO logs the key as the specs you start with not end
[1:15:31] Sebleh: So that means they're entering the key with no healers
[1:15:51] MBG_95: @Sebleh these logs are added manually by RIO staff
[1:16:00] Paleee_: warlock can play magic dispel pet for first boss too
[1:16:14] Sebleh: @MBG_95 fair I guess
[1:16:21] Sebleh: Yeah I've cheesed the spec thing in RIO a lot

[1:41:34] RipThatGuySean: bruh 10 ads in a row.... what this twitch
[1:41:35] ValkyW: this boss casts that way too often cant even play the game
[1:41:44] murazzond: reminds of time when last boss of Necrotic Wake sent Nagura downstairs again and again LUL
[1:41:58] anaking06: I love that mages can just blink from that
[1:42:23] topkeksus: dis boss
[1:42:26] itsSammwiseG: Do you have a shared spotify playlist?
[1:42:30] ellde22: wait mages can blink out of the thornes?
[1:42:34] Snuppii: wow you are being targetted 10 out 10 times
[1:42:47] anaking06: @ellde22 if you have blink and not shimmer, yes
[1:42:48] Sebleh: ever since they “fixed” the pre shapeshift on this boss I just do not like waycrest anymore. this boss is absolutely awful and ruins the whole dungeon for me.
[1:43:01] anaking06: mage baseline blink gets you out of cc
[1:43:02] Sebleh: it’s so frustrating to suck at killing thorns but also suck at being stuck in the thorns
[1:43:10] murazzond: @anaking06 does any run blink andn ot shimmer?
[1:43:13] citizenbystander: just a thorny soul
[1:43:25] TotallyNotRaien: b-but the aesthetic!!

[1:43:51] Uther_The_Lightbringer: this dung is made for storytelling not m+
[1:44:08] murazzond: @anaking06 yes, if you get targeted again and again
[1:44:33] ellde22: @anaking06 Ok thanks. kinda unfair other things dont work then. Luke disengage from hunter usually removes other effects...
[1:44:33] Uther_The_Lightbringer: dunno why they chose it for m+

[2:29:11] Sebleh: Bouldering is so fun tho
[2:29:15] JohnAllenCasts: Bouldering is the only excercise I've ever enjoyed. But I had an ingrown toenail that I needed to have surgury for. Nearly recovered now so I can squeeze into the shoes again
[2:29:27] CascadianConquistador: Aren't you close to the Alps? Just go hike :)
[2:29:52] LesterOfSmeg2: I have a highschool friend that is 53 she fit as hell and looks better then she did in highschool and she was beautiful back then

[2:29:57] club420: i went bouldering once and almost broke my foot. 10/10 would recommend
[2:30:00] Zirconn__: I was sore for like 3 weeks

[2:33:47] Sebleh: dude yes banana bread baking stream!
[2:33:58] Zirconn__: the bimby would make a good banana bread
[2:34:00] YionLi94: @Naguura I also started last year with a change in diet and calisthenics and since then I've gone from 130kg to 113kg and I'm doing well physically and mentally and will definitely continue until I'm at 80-90kg and then try to keep it that way.
[2:34:06] mika01: @Sebleh oh ok

[2:34:34] poppyofmercy: Advice for bananas: keep them in the fridge and they'll last longer even though skin turns black
[2:34:39] Sebleh: if the crust for this cake comes out hard again maybe they can eat it with the banana bread instead Kappa
[2:34:53] heykeenan: @poppyofmercy interesting!
[2:34:58] Kahlandra: my current workout regimen is forcing myself on the treadmill 3 times a week so i get any movement at all
[2:35:00] JohnAllenCasts: oh you have bananas? you should start a greengrocers shop and then develop it into a multinational chain
[2:35:04] Deenial: @YionLi94 This is inspirational. My Personal trainer saw calluses on my hands and was impressed thinking I was doing weights, but it was from opening iced coffee botles FeelsSadDitch
[2:35:06] Kahlandra: work from home life
[2:35:06] Zapzoda: @poppyofmercy is this true? I just bought some yesterday
[2:35:08] Kuroz: hello @tam1h
[2:35:16] sim967: could make banana cake
[2:35:21] Zirconn__: @deenialvt naguuraGiggle naguuraGiggle naguuraGiggle
[2:35:26] Kuroz: CatDriving @DeenialVT
[2:35:27] tam1h: @Kuroz PepeM
[2:35:29] novhakin: push ups is a start
[2:35:31] TiPera: yes it is @Zapzoda
[2:35:33] heykeenan: i bought quite a bit of avocados yesterday. now the clock is ticking to the ripe/overripe phase
[2:35:40] AceReformed: well certain exercises like pullups for example will indeed require some, but you can start with push ups and assisted dips
[2:35:41] Kuroz: PepeM @tam1h
[2:35:45] Kahlandra: @heykeenan you have exactly 27 seconds
[2:35:54] Zapzoda: @tipera welp. throwing them in there 😂
[2:35:58] sim967: sit-ups and pushups
[2:36:00] Zirconn__: wall push up > knee push ups > regular push ups
[2:36:02] heykeenan: @kahlandra haha ain’t  that the truth
[2:36:02] YionLi94: @Naguura I was lucky that I found a calisthenics group in my town/village that regularly does sports in the park, we also have a physiotherapist and a policeman etc. a cool and colorful group.
[2:36:07] Sebleh: @kahlandra I’ve been watching an episode of Marvelous Mrs Maisel and I just ride my indoor bike for the length of the episode, 6 nights a week. it helps that I love the show.
[2:36:08] Deenial: BIGCAT @Zirconn__ @Kuroz
[2:36:12] Zirconn__: oh I misunderstood the discussion
[2:36:12] Arcrowie: supported pull ups maybe?
[2:36:14] novhakin: assisted pull ups
[2:36:27] AceReformed: Push ups, sit ups, planking, assisted dips if you are at the gym, assisted pullups
[2:36:34] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:36:43] sim967: for legs, walking jogging running
[2:36:54] sim967: cycling great
[2:36:59] heykeenan: it’s been about a week since i’ve cycled too
[2:37:01] CascadianConquistador: Rucking! I'm telling you, it's amazing.
[2:37:03] Kerecsen: Hi Naguura? Did you know How does the German werewolf say hello in the morning?......Guten Worgen! :P
[2:37:04] Deenial: Seeing you eat the bruised part of the banana has triggered my fight or flight
[2:37:09] Kahlandra: @Sebleh yeah i have to have something to distract me or else i get bored lol. i've been doing the nyt crossword and other games recently because i'm just catching it on my lunch breaks
[2:37:15] CascadianConquistador: hiking soothes the soul
[2:37:23] AceReformed: Do you have any other plans outside of cycling? I mean cardio is great but maybe some other workouts? Pog @Naguura
[2:37:24] Sebleh: it’s fine I’m sure you’ll get one cycling workout in by MDI (in the next expac)
[2:37:27] YionLi94: @Naguura if you want i can recommend an australian youtuber who helped me with calisthenics he gives good tips and is also a physiotherapist
[2:37:33] poppyofmercy: @Zapzoda Yes. The skin looks awful but when peeling it they still are great. Last much longer than outside the fridge
[2:37:52] Bob34210: like baking a cake? o.O
[2:37:57] shmeb___: do you bicycle outside in the summer?
[2:38:00] Deenial: I got a Peloton machine last year and it's oddly so cute, cos when doing "courses" the same people on the course you can "keep up" with each other
[2:38:05] hackiii: good afternoon everyone MLADY
[2:38:06] Dr_Oolio: your char title is lumberjack, that's probably a decent workout
[2:38:10] Sebleh: and now you can also do your Spanish lessons during your cycling YEP
[2:38:17] Sebleh: but you’d have to do your Spanish lessons for that
[2:38:19] Kuroz: CatDriving @hackiii
[2:38:20] Sebleh: and cycle…
[2:38:26] Kahlandra: my husband lifts weights a few times a week, we just have some free weights so nothing crazy
[2:38:27] hackiii: d: @Kuroz
[2:38:32] hackiii: :d
[2:38:33] Sebleh: :d @hackiii
[2:38:50] hackiii: you could cycle to and from somewhere
[2:38:54] hackiii: PepeLaugh
[2:39:05] IAmJoey: Calistenics are really good workouts, problem is more you need to have a lot of determination for it.
[2:39:14] Kahlandra: i could cycle, i don't have an indoor bike though

[2:46:19] DaCabbageCutta: next is mountain biking!
[2:46:34] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:47:03] Sebleh: I’m actually looking into mountain biking naguuraSip
[2:47:26] Sebleh: the problem is I asked my dad “where can I read about this” and he said “YouTube video” and I can’t fucking learn from videos lol
[2:47:28] Deenial: I somehow ended up on "free climbing tiktok" which is just people climbing cliffs with no safety gear and my stomach is always in knots seeing people do it Deadge
[2:47:46] Deenial: Why TikTok reccomended it to me I don't know, the only walls I climb are the ones I put up with my therapist
[2:47:56] Sebleh: you have a specialized bike with fancy trinkets and parts. kinda like a car.
[2:48:04] Karreyo: @Sebleh take a bike and ride it, is the first step
[2:48:07] DaCabbageCutta: bkxc good YouTube channel
[2:48:07] Sebleh: they have this feature where the seat automatically goes up and down
[2:48:12] Sebleh: it’s great
[2:48:30] Sebleh: shocks, tires, frames, it’s all a thing.
[2:48:37] DaCabbageCutta: just full send shred the gnar
[2:48:43] Kahlandra: @Sebleh i know they have different gears because when i was a kid i had one and i changed the gears when i was going up driveways
[2:48:48] Kahlandra: i was basically a pro
[2:49:23] Sebleh: when you’re mountain biking or trail riding sometimes you have to stand, sometimes you sit, sometimes you want your body up to see and sometimes you go low so you pick up speed with no pedaling so it’s free speed. it’s fun.
[2:49:29] CascadianConquistador: Go from hiking straight into mountaineering haha! Alps are perfect for it!

[2:54:10] Sebleh: Also they’re adding an experience buff up to level 25 (the phase 1t cap)

[4:08:39] drdrozd12: healer queues are way faster
[4:08:48] lonewolf__93: maybe grounding works but tremor dont think so
[4:09:03] Dreclador: I don't think you can stop the MC from going off at all
[4:09:32] CascadianConquistador: did they just shut the door and block the rest of those adds?
[4:09:50] LtJenkins: @Dreclador I think the only way is if you DPS the boss so hard that you skip the ability entirely

[4:40:05] Sebleh: I actually like the last boss in Fall just not the over abundance of shields on the boss
[4:41:14] that_zaerr: i play mage so its a snoozefest for me. i did it on 28 and i thought i was gonna fall asleep its like the same shit for 7 mins
[4:41:16] Jacksprat47: sebleh do you heal
[4:41:23] SeekingVengeance: me, the tank: nothing even hits hard on that boss

[4:43:37] Sebleh: the only interesting boss in BRH is the last one but the one shots just suck. you can make no mistakes and the shadow bolts will kill your run anyway.
[4:43:48] Sebleh: IMO anhway
[4:45:02] Jacksprat47: I want them to add like an los mechanic to that boss
[4:45:30] Jacksprat47: make there be a green pool from the start in p1, make it so you can see where the bolts are coming from, and make the pool soak the bolts

[4:46:20] that_zaerr: @Jacksprat47 stop it you
[4:46:28] Sebleh: they will never bring back td
[4:46:39] Sebleh: that dungeon is broken and poorly designed
[4:47:06] Sebleh: the floors and walls don’t work and it was shown in MDI IIRC so no shot they bring it back just like with Temple and the bugged orbs.
[4:47:07] that_zaerr: i've been doing the hopping in place tech for this boss
[4:47:56] Jacksprat47: @that_zaerr that works if you're a hunter or fire mage, not so much if you kinda need to cast specific stuff. also lag = dead
[4:48:11] drdrozd12: TD in TD was great content
[4:48:18] that_zaerr: yeah, i've noticed that too. sometimes if my ping is off i'll get hit with the fire underneath
[4:49:03] Jacksprat47: @drdrozd12 also emissaries in td was great content. or reaping. Kappa
[4:49:03] StephixOne: what's that blue class
[4:49:10] Jacksprat47: @StephixOne dark mage
[4:49:41] Sebleh: wdym r sham is really good this season
[4:50:16] drdrozd12: emissay season sucked dick
[4:52:17] Sebleh: beguiling was fine tbh it was definitely no ghuun

[4:53:00] Nnoggie: i always kick insta on dk never fails
[4:53:08] drdrozd12: but as a healer main, beguiling basically forced u to only be able to play rdruid. luckily i enjoy rdruid

[5:07:58] TotallyNotRaien: you heavily rely on your equpiment fixing itself
[5:08:26] Sebleh: @ma7ro00om sorry but I only see you as a friend. really an acquaintance. tbh just a twitch chatter at best.
[5:08:55] JohnAllenCasts: things aren't an issue when you ignore them
[5:09:10] Sebleh: All her things fix themselves except for that one camera classic

[5:14:39] Kuroz: they're still trying to figure out how many screws are missing probably
[5:14:43] Sebleh: they’re probably like “how the fuck do we even fix this? NotLikeThis ”
[5:15:05] Sebleh: Wait false alarm? Too late I already called my mom about it.
[5:15:21] Sebleh: What am I supposed to tell her now? "Never mind, Naguura said she didn't order it on the wrong?"
[5:16:10] sim967: oh no
[5:16:19] Tearysage: sombody yoinked it
[5:16:20] Sebleh: Oh no. Well at least my mom is still on the line. Hold on let me update her that' it's not a false alarm after all. classic
[5:17:07] Gamerhcp: SCATTER
[5:17:21] xGreatspiritx: your elitist clip is funny but I am a weakend warrior with dungeons and I have learn a lot from you over the years, love my druid, dont ever change
[5:17:43] y0rge: why not
[5:17:47] cloudberrylive: delivery person stole it
[5:18:03] Sebleh: That's fucked up.
[5:18:27] Sebleh: If it's visible what you ordered and it's not in another box then yeah it's super dumb to leave it
[5:19:22] Sebleh: Okay I told my mom they stole it and she said "why the fuck are you telling me about this if you don't actually know these people?"
[5:19:35] Sebleh: Yes they can
[5:19:37] Tearysage: they can
[5:19:46] Sebleh: You'd have to prove somehow that they're the ones who stole it
[5:19:59] kimtato: They could easily set it down, take a picture, and then take it
[5:20:04] Tearysage: unless you added verification security where you need to sign  at delivery
[5:20:12] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:20:18] Reflux1988: inb4 porch pirates
[5:20:22] y0rge: so if you order somethign exp nevrer pay upfront
[5:20:26] y0rge: always on deliver y
[5:20:41] y0rge: no you dont
[5:20:51] AceReformed: Imagine not living in the netherlands, where signature is required KEKW
[5:20:58] y0rge: i ordered gpu for 1.5k ewuro and i pay on delivery
[5:21:01] Sebleh: Didn't know Amazon had a COD option Kappa
[5:21:18] kimtato: Signature required sucks ass
[5:21:21] AceReformed: Anything above 50eu is required
[5:21:22] bujitto: no rune ?
[5:21:23] cloudberrylive: in finland we are so spread out that we just have to go get stuff most of the time from a electronic lockbox at a grocery store or something
[5:21:27] Sebleh: but also ANYONE can sign it and signatures don't necessarily have to be legible either
[5:21:37] kimtato: My signature is a literal squiggle lmao
[5:21:39] xGreatspiritx: signature is also required on some things in american
[5:21:44] Tearysage: its not required to give your signature unless you specify that you want it like that
[5:21:55] Sebleh: The coozies?
[5:21:59] Sebleh: I totally remember that
[5:22:01] StephixOne: beer cozy yes
[5:22:29] triggerddsf2: How do i get not burned out by wow ? Everytime im at work i really want to play wow but the second i get home i just cant force myself to play it
[5:23:03] xGreatspiritx: if it is small and sent by mail man they can put it in mailbox but others are not because its a ferald problem to open a mailbox
[5:23:12] Sebleh: The delivery person probably had the first person they saw to sign it and then that person put the parcel in your mailbox?
[5:23:17] Sebleh: IDK if your mailbox is a lockbox or not.
[5:23:26] adachi_akaso: i've never seen a shaman healer this season
[5:23:33] Kahlandra: @triggerddsf2 a timeless question honestly
[5:23:49] emuland: play final fantasy XIV hehe
[5:23:55] AceReformed: 29 DHT on tyran KEKW
[5:23:59] AceReformed: Gl with xavius
[5:24:00] Sebleh: @triggerddsf2 don't play it like it's a job. Take breaks when you're not having fun. Play other games. Play FFXIV so you can see how much better WoW is.

[5:24:27] Sebleh: Techno after this dungeon so it plays you out as you end the stream Kappa
[5:24:32] xGreatspiritx: back to work gl in your dungeon have a great day
[5:24:43] emuland: NotLikeThis
[5:24:49] AceReformed: Honestly play neither WoW or FF14, we all know Gw2 is the better MMO
[5:25:06] Sebleh: Keep telling yourself that YEP
[5:25:12] Sebleh: It will work naguuraCope

[5:25:42] warryvibe: @AceReformed We all know dn is the best MMO
[5:25:48] warryvibe: naguuraGiggle
[5:26:08] cloudberrylive: of all the CDs to die after pressing, incarn is definitely #1 for most tilting
[5:27:16] yohobojoe_ssbm: does bursting damage scale based on key number or is it just a flat amount?
[5:27:23] Nejtchurr: Incarn and mirror, then die 3 sec later, makes you wanna shut down the game xD
[5:27:36] StephixOne: GW2 pretty fun yeah
[5:27:41] thenaylander: @yohobojoe_ssbm it scales with key level up to 20 I believe
[5:27:47] StephixOne: just nothing's gripped me like WoW has, but that's a matter of preference really
[5:27:53] AceReformed: Gw2 is great yeh, i'd argue it is better if you enjoy pvp tho
[5:27:55] yohobojoe_ssbm: @thenaylander thank you!
[5:28:25] fox5523: fractals are a bunch of fun in gw2, but felt pointless once you beat them all
[5:28:52] Sebleh: I keep hearing about boomkins running mirror and branch since we get so much incarn uptime that branch actually is useful.
[5:28:54] AceReformed: Getting to fractals as a new player might just take months tho
[5:28:55] skeeld: gw2 just suffers of the same thing ffxiv is suffering right now but way worse - no content
[5:29:06] skeeld: ff is on a giant lull right now and gw2 has been one one for years at this point
[5:29:16] skeeld: and everytime new content comes out for gw2 its quite little
[5:29:28] Kuroz: @Sebleh pepePHONE  we literally talked about canexx using it in the shrine a month ago
[5:29:39] AceReformed: That's like me saying that wow is incredibly boring because i've made it to 3.5k rio, and spending 2h everyday to look for a group is not worth it either Shruge
[5:30:06] fox5523: Making it to 3.5k rio is WAY harder than beating all of the fractal content imo
[5:30:10] skeeld: fractals are cozy as a daily tbh
[5:30:12] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:30:15] skeeld: its really efficient gold per hour
[5:30:22] Sebleh: @Kuroz seblehPhone did we now
[5:30:22] skeeld: and gold is the name of the game in gw2
[5:30:27] AceReformed: Idk I fall asleep in +27s, but pugs are a nightmare
[5:30:29] Sebleh: seblehPhone I do not remember that
[5:30:44] AceReformed: I've never done higher fractals so i've got no good comparison
[5:30:56] skeeld: fractals are brain dead easy once you know them
[5:31:01] skeeld: like genuinely
[5:31:14] skeeld: and each fractal is like, 1/3 of a wow dungeon in length
[5:31:21] AceReformed: i also played Gw2 as my PvP fix, because WoW pvp is seriously fucked up
[5:31:38] Sebleh: seblehDinkdonk idiot seblehDinkdonk
[5:31:38] StreamElements: Hello Sebleh worryAss
[5:31:43] yohobojoe_ssbm: grievous classic
[5:31:57] Sebleh: Grievous? What is that Kappa
[5:31:58] fox5523: The neat thing about fractals is the amount of broken exploits you can take advantage of, that NEVER get fixed haha
[5:32:42] Sebleh: Should have started on time NOTED
[5:32:48] WeaselMuffin: is there no nagarys stream
[5:32:56] Kuroz: Tssk @WeaselMuffin
[5:33:04] Sebleh: I thought we checked MDI comps earlier naguuraSip
[5:33:06] WeaselMuffin: Tssk
[5:33:06] yohobojoe_ssbm: what are worst affixes at higher keys?
[5:33:15] ZugThugTV: wow geoguesser
[5:33:26] Sebleh: Report it as stolen to the website you ordered it from.

[5:35:12] gerryblue: oh wrong city nvm
[5:35:18] Kuroz: are you sure they didn't try a delivery and now it's in adeposit
[5:35:22] Kuroz: ye
[5:35:47] alicemch: evening naguura <3
[5:35:58] Tearysage: it's probably delivered to a depot for storage until sending it out to the house
[5:36:05] Kuroz: operative center for sda
[5:36:38] Kuroz: cause they're not handling the last part, sda is doing bozen to place
[5:36:39] Sebleh: Delivered to a local delivery service?
[5:37:40] Tearysage: you should get a delivery tracker from the other service then
[5:38:15] NyssNyss: can always call their customer service and inquire them about delivery status!
[5:38:59] Tearysage: you need to be sherlock holmes these days to find your packages :3
[5:39:18] Kuroz: it doesn't make sense honestly
[5:39:22] Sebleh: could have shipped from separate warehouses
[5:39:24] Aegatron: Caropls
[5:39:33] Sebleh: oh they were on the same shipment from the start? nvm
[5:39:41] Kuroz: but sda also says delivered with poste delivery service
[5:39:51] Kuroz: for that screenshot code you sent me
[5:39:57] chronox1997: Someone had problems befor, that wow dont see all of your mouse bottoms for keybinding? Would apreaciate some tips:D
[5:40:01] NyssNyss: they miight get ordered from different warehouses and send them separately. happened to me before
[5:40:12] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:40:17] Tearysage: call them an inquire it is gonna be the way
[5:40:34] Kuroz: it says signature inside the mailbox
[5:41:02] Kuroz: so either they left a piece of paper to say they have to pick it up
[5:41:12] chronox1997: I have a new Mouse with more buttons and i cant get them to keybind, because they dont react
[5:41:14] StephixOne: @chronox1997 You might have to use the mouse software to map the buttons to some combos, (e.g. Shift-F11), as the buttons themselves don't map to any actual windows combo
[5:41:30] lEnpactl: @chronox1997 you need to configure them buttons in the mouse software first
[5:41:43] chronox1997: @lEnpactl Oh thx man
[5:41:47] Tearysage: if they "deliver" when your not home, they leave a signed note in the mailbox to say they where there and you can pick it up at their service
[5:42:46] Kuroz: normally when it says centro operativo to centro operativo they failed to deliver
[5:42:59] Kuroz: and the courier left something in the mailbox to go pick it up
[5:43:13] Kuroz: but it's weird they put it as delivered on the website
[5:44:09] Sebleh: when Italian post leaves a failure to deliver notice in South Tyrol, is it in German or in English?
