[0:47:00] Emmer003: They tuned the Invocation rune so that it deals instant damage to the target equal to the spells remaining periodic damage vs just one period/tick so that rune might be cracked if it stays that way
[0:47:12] nicolocoxo: still 3 mac or we can 4 now

[1:39:41] deltrexx: u cant disperse while ccd
[1:39:43] Ewertgod: cant u just drain the SP's? drain life/mana without the master channeler rune
[1:39:44] o0darling0o: UA is p3
[1:39:46] feardotrun: yeah I know
[1:39:47] varatupaj: preist pets are annoying as fuck
[1:40:07] NeVolent: priest can kite u man while doting u and dispelin himself..no way lock can win priest
[1:40:10] dominozxx: how insane would it be if UA was insta cast lol
[1:40:13] NeVolent: at 40 cause no ua

[1:41:34] Cloudiz: !otk tourny
[1:41:34] dominozxx: dispel cost scales with level. at 40 priests cant just spam dispel like that. locks have enough to live especially with spellstone
[1:41:34] StreamElements: https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1754610770044702740
[1:41:46] reckiga: so gnome is the next raid
[1:41:49] dominozxx: so drain mana is key
[1:41:51] CDank: Fury warrior looks a little scary for lock
[1:41:51] cyphar007: undead or troll for spriest?
[1:42:04] malebelfdog: New pvp trinket is confirmed tho. Huge rogue nerf I think

[1:42:28] o0darling0o: feral has 15s fear immune
[1:42:32] Landon_MDL: dude wtf , half of the server is going bfd and dungeon spam until 40
[1:42:34] Ewertgod: would u go master channeler vs priest?
[1:42:36] Landon_MDL: how is this possible
[1:42:37] SimpleBeefy: !otk
[1:42:37] StreamElements: https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1754610770044702740

[1:43:14] nbagamer191: can any1 link all the new changes?
[1:43:21] NeVolent: lol rogues 40 energy mutilate and u want meta banned? :P wtf
[1:43:24] Ewertgod: they lose fear in meta form
[1:43:40] CDank: @nbagamer191 check out wowhead brop
[1:43:51] hersh__69: @Ewertgod u dont need against melee as meta
[1:44:01] reckiga: they never patched the audio split thing yet
[1:44:19] NeVolent: drain life gets super strong thoug..but super costy
[1:44:26] Ewertgod: that is true
[1:44:35] dominozxx: @NeVolent whered u get 700 lmao.. its gonna cost 385 xD
[1:44:47] NeVolent: x2 cause of the rune
[1:45:09] ThePlayerCoachStun: what are you farming for snutz?
[1:45:14] EFFSIN: So another tourney
[1:45:29] BoyeTV: who u think can beat lock at 40 in duel?
[1:45:34] dominozxx: its 100% more cost from the rune, rank 3 costs 185 without it. 185x100% 385
[1:45:36] NeVolent: @dominozxx the rune increases mana of drainlife by 100%
[1:45:41] EFFSIN: i heard u chub up 1000miles away from that announcement
[1:45:43] Ewertgod: @BoyeTV rogue ofc

[1:46:48] NeVolent: 370 my dude x2
[1:46:48] varatupaj: some guys made it foe him
[1:47:17] hagbulbia: do you find affliction rune for legs any good? or just incenerate is better in general
[1:47:42] o0darling0o: you will have 3k ? mana at 40 i guess
[1:47:48] NeVolent: love incinerate to bait for kicks when i want to fear
[1:48:03] NeVolent: (but u got imolate also)
[1:48:06] Hotyounglad: you dont like darkpact?
[1:48:17] hagbulbia: to get from friendly to exaltednwith the boxes takes a while no? im kinda late now
[1:48:36] beefstr0321: How you feel about balance druid inc?
[1:49:11] beefstr0321: Yea im stressing warriors

[1:53:32] hagbulbia: ye realm its locked i cant change horde, went ally for a dif thing but bad to compete on pvp
[1:53:39] Bennska: @cmf_westers yeah exactly. Like it will win just because it is more mana efficient than whatever it is thrown at him

[2:16:20] nicolocoxo: destro look good
[2:16:21] cmf_westers: feral and boomkin were just not a thing
[2:16:22] diegodesilva94: what do you feel about 2h enh sham?
[2:16:22] cmf_westers: and now they are
[2:16:25] cmf_westers: and in a big way
[2:16:29] nicolocoxo: stun aoe
[2:16:30] cmf_westers: same with enhance
[2:16:32] jijlol: thought on spriest?
[2:16:41] orangemaple24: same with warr a lot of boring runes
[2:16:46] TierXtreme: spriest gonna hurt everyone!!!!
[2:16:58] cmf_westers: lock got tank and meta
[2:17:04] cmf_westers: but aff is the same I guess
[2:17:05] nivoxt: warlocks were already strong, they tryin to lift up a bit dead classes
[2:17:16] cmf_westers: destro in vanilla is cool, but kinda what we know
[2:17:18] downs504: Can paladin remove sac from locks?
[2:17:32] numero5218: where you gonna quest ?
[2:17:38] cmf_westers: shadow getting mind spike is sick
[2:17:42] meswearshewas18: warlock will be boring tbh
[2:17:44] ValhaLLa82: !otk
[2:17:44] StreamElements: https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1754610770044702740

[2:17:55] ShinerG: same Sadge
[2:17:58] Tesla369: did u see they patched the drain soul lasting after death
[2:18:00] ShotFake: They gave warlock a whole tank build wdym
[2:18:05] cmf_westers: if meta had a damage build it would be exciting
[2:18:06] Steveleeb: it’s nice that arcane is playable now. But without changing the talent trees frost is too good still
[2:18:08] scaff_24: thats how i feel about warrior
[2:18:10] cmf_westers: but the tank spec is kinda meh I guess
[2:18:17] Mimyolol: they should do something fun with firestone
[2:18:18] dominozxx: bro I wanna see soul swap from cata sooooooo bad
[2:18:35] cmf_westers: the OG meta with shadow wave was so sick
[2:18:41] Qslank: it makes sense though right because warlock and warr were already such a good class in classic era they really didnt need a alot of change to make them any better
[2:18:43] cmf_westers: kinda wish they brought that back a little
[2:18:49] Cafe0le: If uou want new things locks in retail get a spec rework every other patch KEKW
[2:19:04] Johhny321: Meta with Felguard/Immo aura will be sweet
[2:19:12] m0n3ybadger: I came back to WoW to gulch with the boys and we had a 90 min queue earlier on Horde. I hope this isn’t as intended
[2:19:19] cmf_westers: spike, homunculi, void plague
[2:19:25] cmf_westers: actually very good additions
[2:19:25] shiftbbg: mind spike is so lame
[2:19:34] azgarth18: Warlock are simming 2nd dps atm right?
[2:19:34] Hemmis7: Can sp pennance in form ?
[2:19:48] Landon_MDL: dude you were the king of phase 1
[2:19:48] downs504: You will take shadow world death 100% of the time hemmis
[2:19:54] sudd7: not in form, but having it is nice. it's holy in sod
[2:19:55] Steveleeb: you thinking about going spriest now?
[2:19:56] Landon_MDL: cant happen twice in a row
[2:19:57] downs504: both hand runes
[2:19:58] Landon_MDL: maybe phase 3
[2:20:14] Qslank: They gave priests and shamans so much mana regen its refreshing to see they understand going oom 30 seconds into a fight is cringe
[2:20:18] meswearshewas18: its all about skill
[2:20:19] Landon_MDL: i was talking about new things as well
[2:20:21] sudd7: excitement
[2:20:23] Landon_MDL: you had meta
[2:20:29] Landon_MDL: the most hyped thing ever
[2:20:33] downs504: Elemental shaman will be interesting
[2:20:40] Orale_Holms: !OTK TOURNY
[2:20:40] StreamElements: https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1754610770044702740
[2:20:50] joker859: can’t decide between shaman and spriest. help a brotha out
[2:20:52] Landon_MDL: are they even gonna make a list?
[2:20:53] Froziee: i hope immo aura is level 40
[2:21:00] Froziee: would make meta cool
[2:21:00] Cafe0le: The sims guys are saying lock tank is going to pump but no fear is cringe
[2:21:13] downs504: Am I the only one who thinks rogue is a boring class?
[2:21:14] cmf_westers: oh yea, ele is gonna be the new pop off class for sure
[2:21:22] Bennska: Eli hits so hard
[2:21:22] joker859: yeah man wow looks fun af
[2:21:28] joker859: ele
[2:21:30] TierXtreme: do you think the starsurge range nerf is actually that big of a deal?
[2:21:35] cmf_westers: just need no one to look at you in bg's and you'll murder the whole team
[2:21:38] meswearshewas18: have you ever played against drakedog?'
[2:21:43] Hemmis7: Did they mention anything about priests being able to change their priest racial this phase? They said it would come later on when sod launched
[2:21:43] nicolocoxo: lvling right now as shamman love it
[2:21:47] sherekhan75: p2 sham should be a blast
[2:21:50] sherekhan75: but enh will be good too
[2:21:52] downs504: WHat classes counter shaman?
[2:21:52] TierXtreme: 36 yards with talents
[2:21:53] GreanzyW: the legend
[2:21:54] Xzion129: just a slight range nerf
[2:21:56] sudd7: 35 yrds
[2:22:02] sherekhan75: 30 yds so 36 with talents

[2:22:28] TierXtreme: ya other than people running from you and murking them...its a fine change...i was never over 42 besides chasing people down
[2:22:39] cmf_westers: I think boomkin will still be a monster in bg's and open world, especially with travelform
[2:22:41] Cafe0le: Hopefully starsuge gets buffed by eclipse and stuns with the starfire talent YEP
[2:22:47] nachomojo: r u doing a 24 hour for launch
[2:22:50] lastad94: what does berserk do for ferals?

[2:23:05] Xzion129: @Cafe0le read the starsurge rune and youll get ur answer
[2:23:22] cmf_westers: energy cost reduction for mangle

[2:24:04] GreanzyW: might quit though
[2:24:05] HeavyCream14: whats up man

[2:27:11] lastad94: what are you thinking aobut rogue in p2 ?
[2:27:16] Cantbedoing: grats man
[2:27:22] Xzion129: @cmf_westers STV is the confirmed zone
[2:27:22] Acrcus: Oh what do you do again for work?
[2:27:32] Cantbedoing: the locky
[2:27:58] Cantbedoing: then hunter/war
[2:28:24] cmf_westers: I dont know if it's confirmed
[2:28:28] cmf_westers: ppl are saying it
[2:28:31] cmf_westers: but I cant find it though
[2:28:36] Cafe0le: Just nuke arathi what a waste of space
[2:28:37] pancake_mike: it's been confirmed since SoD was first announced
[2:28:42] beefstr0321: STV has always been the zone
[2:28:43] beefstr0321: <3
[2:29:08] TierXtreme: how do you think alliance feels about SM LOL
[2:29:11] varatupaj: same with ashenvale :D
[2:29:13] TierXtreme: don't wanna hear it LOL
[2:29:15] veiloflonelystars: STV is a a main place for everything
[2:29:18] Cafe0le: Arathi and aszhara are the worst zones in classic
[2:29:25] KingDaDa1011: STV bangs
[2:29:27] YesImFredTheBest: STV going to be so aids for alliance XD
[2:29:31] LINK8N: Desolace
[2:29:36] Bennska: It is kind of small, so the raid groups will clash more often
[2:29:40] nivoxt: STV bis, gurubashi also there, a lot of shit will be going on at the same time
[2:29:50] cmf_westers: @Xzion129 can you link where they confirmed this? I cant find it
[2:29:51] Blide: i can wait to get farmed as a warrior feelsbadman
[2:30:16] Mimyolol: dustwallow is pretty good

[2:30:21] Cafe0le: Desolace has maraudon and centaurs, arathi has nothing LUL
[2:30:24] hearingblockchain: stv is going to be poppin snutz
[2:30:34] dominozxx: I fucking hate dustwallow
[2:30:59] termthegamerr: sheesh 300g not enough?!
[2:31:05] TierXtreme: isn't mount like 40g?
[2:31:09] EmpurityTV: 700g atm lol
[2:31:10] nononplus: that's about 300g more than I have :)
[2:31:12] m0n3ybadger: not enough?!?
[2:31:21] joker859: 100g now I think for mount
[2:31:25] TierXtreme: 300g more than enough with no more gdkp lol
[2:31:39] Mimyolol: underworld band gonna be spendy
[2:31:46] joker859: stv mount tho but would hate to try to get it without a mount lol
[2:31:47] cmf_westers: I got 400, but it's been a lot harder to make gold from GDKP since people all got their bis items
[2:31:52] Cantbedoing: im sitting on 350g but have some p2 recipes im hoping will make some good gold
[2:31:59] cmf_westers: and now GDKP is gonna be banned right? so I guess no more easy money
[2:32:15] cmf_westers: oh let me check
[2:32:15] Mimyolol: stv pvp ring is 8stam/8int 14shadow
[2:32:29] Qslank: Yeah i got the email lmao i thought i got banned for a second
[2:32:30] sudd7: the gurubashi vendor has 2 rings for priest, idk about lock.
[2:32:33] Mimyolol: so it might be an underworld band + pvp ring angle
[2:32:36] TierXtreme: but they didn't ban boosts
[2:32:38] TierXtreme: roll a mage lol
[2:32:44] StreamElements: All information regarding my addons, characters, or boosts will be found in my discord: https://discord.gg/eMTkkB3
[2:32:48] Schnick12: wish they updated the world epics to be competitive with raid gear
[2:32:50] cmf_westers: nope, guess I'm not on file in the bliz naughty office
[2:32:53] Qslank: @TierXtreme did they nerf living flame healing?
[2:32:55] TierXtreme: shocked they didn't ban boost

[2:33:39] TierXtreme: blizz likes bots though and their money
[2:33:42] dominozxx: blizzard said they have new tech for phase 2 to deal with botting
[2:33:43] TierXtreme: won't ever admit it
[2:34:08] TierXtreme: "we are trying to get rid of bots" does nothing lol
[2:34:09] TierXtreme: resub
[2:34:21] cmf_westers: this is the lost ark solution, instead of fixing bots just ban things that benefit players instead
[2:34:24] vindixon: You have to be invited to the tourney?!
[2:34:25] dominozxx: remove click to move so bots cant function.. problem solved. no one uses that anyway
[2:34:33] Jeilyn7: bots buy sub for gold
[2:34:37] cmf_westers: oh you guys like buying gold? here's wow tokens, buy our gold instead
[2:35:32] cmf_westers: it'll come at 60
