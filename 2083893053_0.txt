[0:06:41] LilyOfTremere: Is the drop rate the same in LFR? :)
[0:07:20] Ujai321: i will be the "next person", and i did this raid exactly 0 times. so you didnt do it a lot, apparently Kappa
[0:07:21] Daemavand: Greetings all!

[0:07:49] Sabrius_: omg i swear im not stalking you hazel but i am also doing abyss worm runs today. i have over 400 attempts since end of legion
[0:07:52] Daemavand: I dont even know which raid this is lol
[0:08:07] maachen: I get lost going in here and never make it to the avatar
[0:08:07] jgbrit: I loved SOD, I am a shadowlands main though
[0:08:11] bitshady: gl with this mount, it has not been kind to me... :P
[0:08:30] macydoes_: hear me out Hazel… since ur in a BfA roll… King’s Rest 🤣
[0:08:54] Darabelia: good day hazel and good luck on the mount
[0:10:02] jgbrit: Look at me multitasking, watching Hazel and in a BG
[0:10:03] derrickbehunter: currently on 800+ attempts for zul gurub raptor
[0:10:05] anker_jym: What is the drop chance of the Quantum Courser though?
[0:10:20] apheelia96: Good morning Hazel and Group! hazelLove
[0:10:24] GattsuGaming: Good day to you Hazel, so what aesthetic do you like more, Wow classic or current wow?
[0:10:24] macydoes_: the way i felt goosebumps on my neck when you mentioned Rise keys? Not that horrible M+ dg 😭
[0:10:29] Ujai321: maybe you could drink more coffee if you are reTIRED
[0:10:40] derrickbehunter: i got the courser drop and it dropped the tazavesh mount which takes a long time to solo so im glad i got that one!
[0:10:48] jeffdmk: cant you pretend the people in the rise keys are robots?
[0:10:53] Ujai321: what if they involve YOU in THEIR mount runs? ever thought about that?
[0:11:00] marvin1995xo: how do you like the dragonflight events ?
[0:11:11] jgbrit: You talk yourself into it lol, you don't need me to
[0:11:15] Hippwn: I had fun doing comp stomp all evening yesterday
[0:11:39] witchhobbit: i need to try this comp stomp thing
[0:11:59] jeffdmk: robots can coordinate things now
[0:12:12] GreenArrowed: dune 2 was great yall, take the time to go see it if only for the sound design
[0:12:38] mediocrity_squared: I watched Mean Girls musical movie last night...it was really fun...I enjoyed it
[0:13:14] mehayla: What addon do you use for that interface for drops?
[0:13:20] Zuldak: I had some issues with the changes from the book but I'm Uber nerd nitpicking. It's a good movie
[0:13:25] Ujai321: those were the days
[0:13:53] Sabrius_: i only just recently learned how to solo mythic eonar - such a p.i.t.a.
[0:13:55] mehayla: perfect I can't wait for it to tell me how incompetent I am! Thanks!
[0:14:02] anker_jym: I don't download the addon for that reason lol. Well, that and I don't like addons
[0:14:13] McScooterson: greetings from comp stomp
[0:14:22] Ujai321: not incompetent. just incomplete
[0:14:44] jeffdmk: @mehayla the site data for azeroth tells you how your incompetence compares to others
[0:14:45] Ujai321: what did the robots say to you?
[0:14:55] McScooterson: there's a path back there?!
[0:14:59] Zuldak: Yeah comp stomp week. I am on track to get the pvp set for the season
[0:15:10] mehayla: @jeffdmk This information will haunt me
[0:15:16] witchhobbit: yessss i am finally mecha-done!
[0:15:31] McScooterson: @witchhobbit grats!!
[0:15:41] apheelia96: can the Jaina Mount be soloed?
[0:15:46] bitshady: water route also has advantage of killing the pack near the water, they can drop epic boe's
[0:15:55] anker_jym: @witchhobbit Finishing that achievement was so satisfying. Grats to you!
[0:16:04] Getcha_Pulll: what are we farming?
[0:16:11] Krekk01: @HazelNuttyGames Gratz on your parrot mount from earlier!
[0:16:22] bitshady: @apheelia96 No, but there's groups going every week, just look in lfr
[0:16:39] witchhobbit: @anker_jym for realllll! same with nazjatar, all i need is to get my last follower to level 30 haha. can't wait
[0:16:46] jeffdmk: The auto call thing feels pretty nice once you are 100% in many zones
[0:16:51] Zuldak: No Jaina is not solvable
[0:16:56] eielwind: ohhhh i missed you getting parrot! gratz!
[0:16:56] Ujai321: "addon called AllTheThings showed me too many things, 1 star"
[0:16:59] Zuldak: Soloable
[0:17:20] apheelia96: Im trying to figure out a good BFA mount to farm
[0:17:21] anker_jym: @witchhobbit I've been putting off Nazjatar lol. Best of luck to you!!
[0:17:21] Ujai321: hey, some egos like stroking
[0:17:29] jeffdmk: whats wrong with a little ego?
[0:17:46] jgbrit: I've got a sick quilboar game and the quilboar quest too LUL
[0:17:55] witchhobbit: @anker_jym you too!!
[0:18:00] Ujai321: dude. whenever i see my parents' phones, they have like 25 notifications showing
[0:18:05] Ujai321: and it drives me nuts

[0:18:32] Ujai321: menagagerie

[0:18:32] Streamlabs: mediocrity_squared just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:19:03] Shinra_: how does one fall in love with a game. i want to like have that hyperfixation but othing seems fun to me lately
[0:19:38] Ujai321: me-NAGA-gerie
[0:19:40] Ujai321: you get it
[0:19:43] saga_no: Juuhuu
[0:19:48] eielwind: zero icons if possible
[0:20:07] Ujai321: i never say funny words
[0:20:20] bitshady: the only desktop icons I allow are temporary notepad reminders
[0:20:23] jeffdmk: under 5 icons that are super commonly used
[0:20:24] Shinra_: its all i ever known tho you know
[0:20:25] saga_no: As few icons as possible - but also ordered into sections; game launchers are clumped together; editing software and adjacent is clumped together, etc
[0:20:33] Octopixy1971: @saga_no hazelWave
[0:21:06] saga_no: I also use the taskbar for most launches - but I keep the same icons (like Blizz, Epic, etc) on the desktop itself
[0:21:16] witchhobbit: same, i try to keep as little as possible on my screen
[0:21:17] bitshady: it's an ocd thing for sure :)
[0:21:23] anker_jym: I have two columns of icons at work, and even that's too much for me. I have coworkers who have their entire screen is icons, and it stresses me out
[0:21:23] Ujai321: the thing about notifications for me: every single one is someone tipping me on the shoulder, going "hey, have you seen this?". if anything does that 25 times in a row, i will fight it.
[0:21:28] Daemavand: That sort of desktop is a layer of personal hell for me lol
[0:21:36] averageteacup: I saw someone with 3 pages of icons on the desktop ... i didn't even know this is possible! :D
[0:21:42] eielwind: my coworker has like 31,000 email badges on his phone
[0:21:59] McScooterson: desktop folders people, folders
[0:22:03] Oswaldovzki: Totally! That's how I even open apps on my phone
[0:22:08] Ujai321: i have stuff on my desktop, i dont mind that as much
[0:22:20] Oswaldovzki: My desktop is totally clean
[0:22:25] bitshady: I'm guessing that epople that have a clean desktop have a clean desk as well

[0:22:36] Streamlabs: cainnar just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:22:40] Zuldak: Question. What view do you use for opening folders? I use details but I see others using icons
[0:22:43] cashthb: hallo
[0:22:47] wolfcloudchaser80: I started with DOS. I'm used to "C: ,  cd/games/sierra/qfg , qfg"
[0:22:55] wolfcloudchaser80: All typed
[0:22:56] Ujai321: 2 for the price of 1? heck yeah that's worth my time
[0:23:01] witchhobbit: sairaLUL
[0:23:17] andr4ws: Oh Icons... The things I burned on a cd thinking they were full games, went to a new pc and was surprised why the games didn't run from the cd...

[0:24:04] Ujai321: so what are you doing when this mount drops today?
[0:24:12] Ujai321: well, after that
[0:24:33] Ujai321: assume it's 9:30
[0:24:49] Octopixy1971: Hai Miss Kira <3 <3 <3
[0:24:57] witchhobbit: you mean hearthstone BGs right?? LUL
[0:25:03] gertrudean: Haven't q'd up for anything from Dalaran b4. Which do you choose for abyss worm hunt?
[0:25:05] cashthb: what if they have your favorite pizza on the menu, you just didn't try it yet?
[0:25:07] Ujai321: it's in the name!
[0:25:23] Ujai321: you really are on auto pilot
[0:25:37] anker_jym: Have you tried making your own pizza?
[0:25:42] saga_no: I was about to ask why you'd run Freehold....
[0:25:44] jgbrit: I have 2 pipers and its only the start of the game, I'm doing it!
[0:25:45] witchhobbit: hahah i was going to say, what happened to hazel, she loves pvp BGs now?? LUL
[0:25:57] Ujai321: is it a calzone
[0:26:12] Ujai321: do you put the dough on top of your toppings
[0:26:20] Ujai321: why is it not super traditional?
[0:27:48] Ujai321: toppings of choice?
[0:27:59] saga_no: Hm. I really should run through the Legion instances for mog...
[0:28:02] andr4ws: Ananas!
[0:28:15] jeffdmk: round pizzas cook more evenly
[0:28:20] cashthb: wait, what do you mean "they are no longer goey"? you sure you don't like your bread raw?
[0:28:36] Ujai321: that's a tall pizza at the end of the day
[0:28:42] kynlaeh: i had a butter paneer fusion pizza last night it was quite good
[0:28:57] saga_no: Yeah - there's probably a lot of plate, mail and leather mog I haven't collected from Legion
[0:29:09] DapherCake: Sorry if you already know after the boss you can drop down and swim to the left to reach the 3rd boss quicker <3
[0:29:22] Ujai321: do you grate the cheese yourself, or do you use pregrated?
[0:29:29] Ujai321: or like, slices
[0:29:49] kynlaeh: i think grating makes a better cheese for melting
[0:30:04] cashthb: @Ujai321 who uses pre graded cheese tho?
[0:30:18] jgbrit: Triple piper... LETS GOOOO
[0:30:26] Ujai321: @cashthb i know some of those people
[0:30:33] anker_jym: The swim skip is nice for me, but I am a Warlock, so I have a swim speed increase...speaking of which, why did they decide to give Warlocks underwater breathing and swim speed increase? What's the class fantasy there??
[0:30:37] cashthb: btw pre sliced is really good usually
[0:30:42] marvin1995xo: pre graded cheese is often awful not always
[0:30:54] saga_no: Hangover from Undead?
[0:30:57] Ujai321: they just really hate water
[0:31:00] jgbrit: I am due in work in 27 minutes though sooooo.
[0:31:00] kynlaeh: that’s what i meant like i grate cheese. something about the anti clump factor they put has a weird texture to me
[0:31:12] saga_no: Undead were one of the OG races who could be warlocks afaik
[0:31:20] witchhobbit: i didn't even realize warlocks had a swim speed increase
[0:31:22] wolfcloudchaser80: They open a portal to... a place that has air.
[0:31:24] Ujai321: how long is a BG for you, on average?
[0:31:41] Ujai321: i mean in your watch
[0:31:44] HeatherLianne: Maybe, and I'm reaching here, it's because demons are from hell, which is "underground" and so "underwater"
[0:32:02] Ujai321: that is quite the lifehack
[0:32:04] cashthb: well if they are out in the twisting nether doing demony stuff they might need a way to get by without breathing
[0:32:13] Ujai321: "dont charge your watch, so you have infinite time!"
[0:32:24] andr4ws: No offense meant at all... but as an ADHD person, do I sense another ADHD? LUL
[0:32:41] Ujai321: how many walks do you go on per day?
[0:32:43] Zuldak: Sadly the daylight savings change died in the oregon senate. We're doing the fall back another year
[0:32:48] cashthb: great tip, I can just pretend I didn't wake up at 1 pm today
[0:33:36] darthduk: I just had a 10 year old Hazel pet battle youtube video show up on my front page today. A blast from the past.
[0:33:36] Yoshli: That|s a funny looking priest
[0:33:39] Ujai321: i wondered about that today. 'how many walks do you go on with a dog, 2 or 3'
[0:33:50] andr4ws: Fair :D A friend of mine and me kinda renamed it tho (it's different in our language), rough translation would be PFBS... Predisposition for being silly
[0:34:03] jeffdmk: can i have advice for something how can i meet a partner if i have no social connections and also keep my phone in the closet?
[0:34:35] Ujai321: that is just good life advice, really
[0:35:02] BoogiePonderosa: in your estimation, based on the screening, is the criteria more stringent than stuff like me feeling easily distracted? :D
[0:35:07] McScooterson: @jeffdmk telepathy?
[0:35:32] Daemavand: "MOOSE WILL PLAY NOW"
[0:35:38] jeffdmk: @McScooterson hmm i could try to work on that
[0:35:39] saga_no: @jeffdmk Ouija board I guess?
[0:35:42] Ujai321: a cute 100 pound boi
[0:36:24] Yoshli: Where can you get the firey Moonkin?
[0:36:29] wolfcloudchaser80: @jeffdmk Met my partner on WoW.
[0:36:43] saga_no: @BoogiePonderosa as someone who's been screened for it 5-6 times ...yes; it's a whole slew of criteria in combination that makes up the diagnosis
[0:36:43] Ujai321: oh, do you want to go through how the screening like, works? because i have no idea how they do it
[0:36:59] Daemavand: That makes so much sense
[0:37:42] Daemavand: Hear hear!
[0:37:43] BoogiePonderosa: @saga_no right.. i figured but hadn't heard from someone who'd gone through it :)
[0:37:43] sence_00: Hi Hazel, no HC today?
[0:37:58] Zuldak: Yeah if you hate moonkin you can set it on fire
[0:38:10] cashthb: cold hard truth: our generation likes to self diagnose with any random mental illnes to justify them being sub functional before trying to fix their life - I typed it before you said it!
[0:38:25] antiva: how long have you been live for? :)
[0:38:25] cashthb: dating apps work pretty well from what I heard
[0:38:39] sence_00: finished like your got the mount?! Or ran out of toons :(
[0:38:42] saga_no: @BoogiePonderosa It's likely different depending on where in the world it's done; here it typically involves a stack of questionnaires to fill out, and the person doing the assessment asking leading questions about your childhood, teenage years, young adult life, and current adult life
[0:38:50] sence_00: gratz!!
[0:38:58] BoogiePonderosa: so many ppl (esp. on socials) talk about their "adhd brain" etc and like you said, it's a tempting idea to think it might apply to one's self
[0:38:58] McScooterson: @cashthb don't
[0:38:58] Daemavand: Oh you got it!! Grats!!
[0:39:00] Ujai321: pro: you theoretically get to meet people. con: some of those people suck
[0:39:07] sence_00: that was a long grind
[0:39:18] saga_no: But my screenings were also a sort of catch-all thing to see if *anything* popped up, and if anything does - we delve deeper
[0:39:25] anker_jym: Where did you get the butterfly pet on this Hunter?
[0:39:32] BoogiePonderosa: @saga_no hmm.. where is here? (im in US)
[0:39:43] KingWoozy: I don't recognize this dungeon what is this
[0:39:44] saga_no: @BoogiePonderosa Norway
[0:39:57] McScooterson: @KingWoozy tomb of sargaras raid
[0:40:13] KingWoozy: @McScooterson ty

[0:40:24] Streamlabs: lkatey75 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:40:29] Daemavand: So, look for more things to trip over in densely populated places, got it
[0:40:31] BoogiePonderosa: @saga_no oh cool! yeah diff countries diff medical practices
[0:40:41] sence_00: even when I was on dating apps, meeting people via a hobby was easier
[0:40:53] eielwind: omfg LFG of dating lol
[0:40:56] sence_00: but ya also the long-form dating sites are better
[0:40:57] notjackblackk: first time catching you live! only ever watched the youtube videos. you’re the best!
[0:41:00] anker_jym: The LFG of dating is probably the best description I've ever heard of it XD
[0:41:19] saga_no: Basically - every time I've gotten a new therapist over the past 15 years - I've gotten a screening for anything/everything and a couple of specific ADHD tests (being that I have other diagnoses who have similar symptoms and traits to ADHD, so the test is done to exclude one to confirm the other, sort of)
[0:41:27] Ujai321: or in another country
[0:41:57] harrybabes: hi everyone, happy thursday harryb27KirbyShowLove hazelWave
[0:42:07] kynlaeh: wow i never thought about it that way tho
[0:42:19] sence_00: plus in long distance or online relationships your brain is filling in a lot of blanks
[0:42:29] sence_00: like you cant know them THAT well
[0:42:35] kynlaeh: i’ve only used the app for less than a week a couple years ago and met my current partner. definitely lucky
[0:42:37] realDonPanini: Prayge
[0:43:00] Daemavand: I think the "right" person becomes that perfect/right person over time
[0:43:04] Daemavand: but it doesn;t start that way.
[0:43:09] LKatey75: You're watching netflix again?
[0:43:11] harrybabes: i love a romcom or chick flick
[0:43:14] wolviecb: searching for the "perfect match" is the easiest way to bork you relationships
[0:43:26] BoogiePonderosa: @saga_no I'd worry id feel like im bouncing between diagnoses and getting stuck in a vague state of self understanding
[0:43:27] sence_00: Legion-adjacent question since youre in Tomb - do you have the rare mog sets from Argus?
[0:43:38] ExArthor: ExArthor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Hi Hazel! Hope you're having a great morning hazelLove

[0:43:46] cashthb: no worries, I can give out dating advices instead of you!
[0:43:50] Ujai321: what, you are watching netflix while playing HC?
[0:43:52] LKatey75: I don't know if I could date again. I'm 48, 49 in a couple months, and full of biases :D :D
[0:44:00] kyubiistraza: where did you get the butterfly pet ?
[0:44:01] sence_00: just started trying to get those sets and oof - not a fun zone to be in
[0:44:03] apheelia96: Im OLD why do u say partner instead of boyfriend ?
[0:44:06] andr4ws: Any insider info about 10.2.6? natahuSus
[0:44:08] saga_no: @BoogiePonderosa Well, as it turns out - every time I've gotten the screening, it's come back the same thing every time, with the exception of the most recent one that resulted in a new diagnosis (in addition to the existing ones)
[0:44:17] kynlaeh: what level are you now in HC
[0:44:44] BoogiePonderosa: @saga_no oh ok.. at least there's a common thread to focus on
[0:44:48] kynlaeh: oo
[0:44:51] chops6965: does your partner play WoW?
[0:44:55] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh wait.. can anyone see this? My VPN may be ghostifying me again.
[0:44:58] GreenArrowed: i just spent an hour on the phone with my wireless and internet company trying to 1. log into either account 2. combine them so i stop having 2 accounts. ready to nap for the rest of the dead.
[0:45:04] saga_no: In my case specifically - the diagnoses I have received have been like completing a puzzle of myself - they all make sense, they all feel "correct" for me, and since I get the same ones every time.... it seems correct objectively too
[0:45:11] GreenArrowed: rest of the day* ewow lolz
[0:45:12] MrSonicgen: Hello all.
[0:45:16] WoWPoko: @wolfcloudchaser80 We see you.
[0:45:19] Daemavand: Aww thats sad, I was thinking of getting back into it this weekend
[0:45:20] sence_00: oh ya I played for over an hour the other day and nothing popped on deathlog at all
[0:45:31] Daemavand: Mind you, I don't mind the solitude in HC
[0:45:42] wolfcloudchaser80: Cool. Forgot to turn it off, and every day it's about a 50/50 chance that I'm shadow-muted on Twitch.
[0:45:47] Daemavand: Oh I get it, but MMOs are nice when you can see other people around, IMO
[0:45:59] GreenArrowed: yea if you're playing by yourself anyway, doesn't really matter if it's dead. feels the same, to me, when i'm leveling in retail
[0:46:03] sence_00: I guess folks are split between HC and SoD
[0:46:03] DapherCake: Do you plan on running this or normal heoric and mythic or just lfr ? Its a lot of runs I burnt out from it quickly lol
[0:46:08] Ujai321: or having inappropriate names on the deathlog
[0:46:27] Daemavand: Haha true! and I'm a delicate warrior made of papier maché
[0:46:32] antiva: theres starting to be too many dang versions of wow
[0:46:42] BoogiePonderosa: @saga_no that's good! it's nice to have that feeling you can define parts of your life in a constructive way, esp w/ professional guidance
[0:46:43] derrickbehunter: i was having so much fun on hardcore until i died at like 45 to a disconnect i cant bring myself to try it again lol
[0:46:51] ahnn112: i lost my collection motivation :(
[0:46:52] anker_jym: I'm the opposite, I can't get into SOD, but I love HC lol
[0:46:57] Daemavand: @derrickbehunter brutal :<
[0:47:05] cashthb: @Daemavand any game is better when random stuff happens in the world, skyrim has a lot of random encounter mods for a reason
[0:47:07] harrybabes: what was the first instance mount you farmed?
[0:47:08] sence_00: i love that SoD is connected to War Within a bit tho
[0:47:15] Daemavand: @cashthb I agree!
[0:47:37] saga_no: @BoogiePonderosa Here, especially, it also means that I (sadly) get to "skip the line" a bit if I land myself in Psych-ER feeling not great... because my diagnoses are all "heavy psychiatric" ones
[0:47:46] Kalaila_: @sence_00 it is? how so?
[0:47:48] BoogiePonderosa: Black Cherry WOW, Arctic Chill WOW
[0:47:48] Ujai321: and for the plot of '+1'
[0:47:51] cashthb: invincible?
[0:47:59] oger421: does all the things track that
[0:48:08] saga_no: So for me - seeking a diagnosis initially was to understand what was going on - but now I acknowledge the privilege that comes along with having them formally diagnosed
[0:48:12] sence_00: @Kalaila_ T&E have a good video about it, some Xal'atath references
[0:48:19] saga_no: Self-diagnosis is valid - ...but not for seeking formal help, at least not here
[0:48:23] harrybabes: you're like the OG mountfarmer!
[0:48:53] BoogiePonderosa: @saga_no oh no! i mean that's good if you need that help.. but it's too bad it can get that serious for you :(
[0:48:55] saga_no: (It's a big debate online about self-diagnosing certain things because seeking a diagnosis can be very expensive, especially in the US, apparently)
[0:49:03] eielwind: annie like 100%s wow, and i dont know how lol, even with streamer help its insane
[0:49:09] Kalaila_: @sence_00 t&e?
[0:49:19] LKatey75: my still new kitten (10 months) keeps jumping half way up the back of my chair and climbing to the top, OMG startles me every time.
[0:49:22] harrybabes: is annie on youtube?
[0:49:23] sence_00: @Kalaila_ Taliesin and Evitel
[0:49:28] Triskelian: @saga_no Yeah, here in the US you need a formal diagnosis to access care as well :/
[0:49:37] cashthb: dishonored stream confirmed? PogChamp
[0:49:38] LKatey75: He's a tuxedo with the tail of a ragdoll :D
[0:49:46] Kalaila_: helloo3Notes ty! <3
[0:50:01] anker_jym: Does Kira have a favorite plushie/toy?
[0:50:05] Ujai321: the real question is, will you bring this char back to Bastion
[0:50:10] saga_no: @BoogiePonderosa I'm medicated appropriately, and managed well, and right now I don't even have a therapist because I am managing so well solo - *but* there's always a chance that the next 'episode' is a really bad one - so knowing I have the option of skipping the line a little for the grippy sock vacay is a safety-blanket
[0:50:27] anker_jym: Fair enough lol
[0:50:32] Ujai321: smart
[0:50:53] Ujai321: she is on youtube. AnnieFuchsia
[0:51:00] sence_00: love that rainbow toy
[0:51:10] sence_00: havent been able to justify the gold for myself tho
[0:51:19] BoogiePonderosa: grippy sock haha. it's def. nice when health needs settle down.  it's a tough place to be when seas are rough
[0:51:19] Ujai321: 'he looks a year heavy'
[0:51:38] Ujai321: i know, he is just huge
[0:51:43] ExArthor: how how are Kira and the doggy getting along?
[0:52:11] Ujai321: i hope you get him weighed again. i need to know when he hits 100, the joke has been going on for too long
[0:52:20] LKatey75: my grandpa had a 120 lb golden retriever, he'd run at you top speed and spin his tail like a rudder to slow down, and still knock you down :D
[0:52:54] saga_no: @BoogiePonderosa Yeah.. it's because a lot of psych wards will give you those anti-slip socks with the little grippy pads on the soles, so it became a euphemism for it ;P
[0:52:57] anker_jym: Have you been hearing the stories from Tasmania about Neil the Seal?
[0:53:01] ExArthor: lol
[0:53:09] LilyOfTremere: Aww <3
[0:53:41] Hippwn: Maybe one day she will realize he is a warm cuddle partner
[0:53:45] antiva: omg i love neil the seal
[0:53:54] BoogiePonderosa: @saga_no yeah i've been in hospitals enough to be familiar with those socks LUL
[0:54:11] eielwind: my parents got a new cat 5 months ago for their other cat and they still hate each other lol
[0:54:16] Zuldak: Moose would be a warm and soft bed warmer. Just saying.
[0:54:18] Ujai321: kira is a pretty funny dog, to be fair
[0:54:35] anker_jym: It's a seal that just keeps lumbering around town and being a troll. Blocking traffic and playing with traffic comes mostly
[0:54:42] anker_jym: Cones
[0:55:32] Ujai321: brutal
[0:55:57] antiva: neil has become an absolute sensation on the internet with his shenanigans
[0:56:24] Ujai321: where is the rest of that moose?
[0:56:35] Octopixy1971: LUL
[0:56:49] averageteacup: LUL
[0:57:00] BoogiePonderosa: dogs just go for those toy crotches!
[0:57:03] riffraff005: LUL
[0:57:15] witchhobbit: sairaLUL
[0:57:16] Ujai321: dang man
[0:57:18] saga_no: ROFL LUL
[0:57:26] harrybabes: surgeon moose with surgical precision
[0:57:31] antiva: moose might just be a doctor performing amputations and lobotomies
[0:57:43] Ujai321: is that the Riddler?
[0:58:09] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, my pup made a point to remove any squeekers.
[0:58:13] cashthb: if plastic is not for eating why it makes noise?
[0:58:34] kynlaeh: my partner is a med student so he will pretend surgeon fix the toys and give it to our dog (post op) as the post op doctor and he jokes that she has a very poor recovery rate as all of her patients come back for a second procedure lol
[0:58:47] apheelia96: my puppy girl has sooo many toys! shes filling my empty nesting void hazelLove
[0:59:14] cashthb: have you tried kong stuff? also 30$ canadian?
[0:59:22] Zuldak: Moose the destroyer
[0:59:28] Jamertamer: sounds my german shepherd when she gets new toys lol
[1:00:12] anker_jym: I think that's why they made squeaky toys. They're supposed to sound like small animals, which lends itself further to that ancient instinct
[1:00:30] saga_no: I don't even think my Dad's dog has toys...
[1:00:36] wolfcloudchaser80: Those are the carnassial teeth. They're literally arranged like scissors.
[1:01:06] Ujai321: if you said your last dog was stressed out by toys, i would have believed it
[1:01:23] saga_no: The Klee-kai?
[1:02:05] eielwind: I want a klee-kai so so bad, hard to find here though
[1:02:05] kynlaeh: i was looking at getting a klee kai and the shelter i talked to said that they are naturally very anxious dogs and get very attached to one person and i remembered what you said about your last dog and was like oh it makes sense
[1:03:09] saga_no: Well... Moose is part shepherd, so he's wanting to keep his herd contained
[1:03:22] wolfcloudchaser80: Yup, mine was that way. If mommy and daddy went in different directions, that was concerning.
[1:03:38] kynlaeh: i ended up adopting a different pup bc she had very specific needs i knew i wouldn’t be able to give her and a week later someone adopted her, i hope she’s doing well
[1:03:58] apheelia96: 
[1:04:40] kynlaeh: i tried to convince my mom but she said her 1 dog was enough lol
[1:04:40] MrSonicgen: Gonna go. Have a great day.
[1:05:17] saga_no: @apheelia96 tbf, they are more likely to be snappy if they live their entire life in a doggie purse and never taught how to walk on a leash or given the chance to meet (sniff) other dogs
[1:05:23] anker_jym: Does your living space have a restriction on how many pets you can have
[1:05:36] apheelia96: Its got a lot to do with the owners
[1:05:53] saga_no: Yup.
[1:06:07] GreenArrowed: my besty has a toy poodle who is sweeter than any other toy poodle i've ever met, such a good dog nephew
[1:06:14] saga_no: I'm not wary of any dog - I'm wary of how the owner behaves in relation to the dog
[1:06:34] apheelia96: @saga_no I have dog carrier but not a purse. She has been socialized with my daughters dogs and likes to say hi to everybody she sees
[1:07:35] saga_no: @apheelia96 Yeah... the ones that get picked up by their owners as soon as another dog is nearby - those tend to get snappy because they aren't socialized enough / properly and they learn that their owner will just pick them up anyway
[1:07:59] saga_no: Tiny "purse dogs" walking on a leash, sniffing things, just being a dog - those do fine :)
[1:08:02] apheelia96: true
[1:08:04] anker_jym: Moose has entered the chat!!!!!!!!
[1:08:06] Octopixy1971: <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[1:08:11] tehl00py: it's a moose!!
[1:08:12] stephthebee: hazelShiny hazelShiny <3
[1:08:14] apheelia96: awwwww big puppy
[1:08:17] Octopixy1971: Mr Moose
[1:08:24] tehl00py: wow he is so big now
[1:08:25] NordicSorcerer: doggo! \3 \3
[1:08:25] jeffdmk: why did you get such a tiny dog?
[1:08:36] Triskelian: MOOOOOOOSE!!!!!
[1:08:36] NordicSorcerer: <3
[1:08:38] Zuldak: That's a Wacker of a tail
[1:08:42] Octopixy1971: awww sooo cute
[1:08:57] witchhobbit: hazelShiny
[1:08:59] GreenArrowed: aww sleepy bb
[1:09:00] apheelia96: my Chromie is all excited she sees doggy on screen lol
[1:09:03] GreenArrowed: okay bye sir
[1:09:12] wolfcloudchaser80: He's such a handsome dog.
[1:09:14] rubibeya: <3
[1:09:33] anker_jym: Thank you very much for the guest appearance, Moose. We hope to have you back on the show soon for your new book tour.
[1:09:40] GreenArrowed: @wolfcloudchaser80 can't even help it, a mix of 2 of the handsomest breeds
[1:09:47] ntdrongo: camera shy
[1:09:47] NordicSorcerer: That was Moose? He's grown from pocketsized to making me feel bitesized so fast... <3
[1:10:04] Octopixy1971: lol
[1:10:19] saga_no: @NordicSorcerer I was right - he is roughly the same size as our neighbor's shepherd ;P
[1:10:20] stephthebee: we for sure need a moose emote
[1:10:22] Zuldak: That tail is a hazard lol
[1:10:50] NordicSorcerer: @Zuldak Joy-propelled tail rotor. :P
[1:10:57] saga_no: So random question - ...does Moose react to your changing hair at all?
[1:11:07] stephthebee: thank you for sharing him, so precious
[1:11:16] saga_no: Because - presumably - ...the wig is for stream - and not necessarily for every-day life?
[1:12:23] anker_jym: Kira be like: He's been in here again hasn't he?
[1:12:30] tehl00py: can we get a reveal? lol
[1:12:36] tehl00py: what's it lookin like under there these days?
[1:12:52] dicemeister23: Hi Hazel, happy Thursday! I just started my resto druid journey, any tips or guides that you followed?
[1:12:53] stephthebee: Keira smells a disturbance LUL
[1:12:53] tehl00py: a very dramatic rupaul esque reveal w/ rose petals pls
[1:12:59] slagoroth: Have you done mage tower for warrior
[1:13:03] dicemeister23: Also what is your druid name, would like to see your build if you don
[1:13:18] NordicSorcerer: Canines have their noses directly connected to their visual cortex. And they can literally smell you genetic makeup. I think Moose's nose overrides his vision when it comes to identifying "his human". ;)
[1:13:22] wolfcloudchaser80: I imagine it looks like what it did when it was first buzzed. And that's on the VOD channel, I'd think.
[1:13:26] Zuldak: You did surv hunter and fire mage iirc
[1:13:28] slagoroth: the best transmog out of the whole thing
[1:13:33] cashthb: maybe crinkle wants that warrior mage tower set
[1:13:48] GreenArrowed: ah, the internet
[1:13:50] anker_jym: Just remember: those people suck
[1:13:55] jeffdmk: yeah i legit miss the short hair
[1:14:03] witchhobbit: aw yeah understandable :'(
[1:14:03] tehl00py: they're just jelly they can't pull it off
[1:14:10] watergoddess06: watergoddess06 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[1:14:11] Streamlabs: watergoddess06 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:14:25] saga_no: Yeah.. I remember that part... when I had a buzzed head..... but they weren't online - they were in my face out in public, which made it a little awkward at times
[1:14:34] saga_no: I love the way I look with a buzz though
[1:14:34] dicemeister23: Sorry I meant to say rest druid PVP journey.. lol .. any guides that you followed?
[1:14:36] NordicSorcerer: @HazelNuttyGames Whut? Some people with less-than-ideal-intelligence utters nasty things on the internetz? When did this start? ;)   (p.s. ignore them, you look good and your smile lights up a room)
[1:14:48] ajeazy84: Any thoughts on what the pirate patch is gonna be this month?
[1:14:59] saga_no: I look like a younger Sinéad O'Connor - especially when I wear makeup
[1:15:12] witchhobbit: oh yeah old women were not afraid to say mean things to me about my hair color in public lol (or my grandmother)
[1:15:24] witchhobbit: it does get tiring
[1:15:28] stephthebee: tbh you rock every hair stage and people suck do what makes you comfy
[1:15:34] kossyluna: I was just thinking that I miss your short hair, I think it looks great
[1:15:42] anker_jym: Ouch lol
[1:15:44] GreenArrowed: i truly cannot believe we haven't gotten news about the patch yet
[1:15:48] saga_no: The irony of it all was that I was pulling more women than these people were through no effort of my own whatsoever - so I chose to believe they were just salty about my insane game.
[1:15:58] dicemeister23: Player Housing.. in the form of pirate ships
[1:16:09] GreenArrowed: but at the same time i can, because the layoff probably disrupted a lot of internal and external comms stuff
[1:16:36] ghostie1995: I never built an expectation from the start but I like watching what people think it is
[1:16:40] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm fairly partial to short hair after a few defining memories from my youth of some particularly attractive actresses that sported short hair.
[1:16:41] witchhobbit: uhhh. am i the only that just noticed the azerothian archives vendor at the big dig site? lol
[1:16:58] slagoroth: Have you ever played runescape
[1:17:01] apheelia96: I need a good mount to solo farm! Just cant figure out one. Rust Feather is only once a day
[1:17:04] databob1: there needs to be more of a balance between secrecy and information
[1:17:08] witchhobbit: provisioner aristta, a draenei lady, sells the mog
[1:17:25] databob1: they did
[1:17:25] riffraff005: yes!
[1:17:27] Octopixy1971: yeah they put it in last reset
[1:17:30] witchhobbit: wait not a draenei lady, void elf or blood elf haha
[1:18:00] GreenArrowed: yea 100%
[1:18:26] Curufin_: personally hate all the datamining and spoilers, i like to be excited in christmas morning
[1:18:58] saga_no: I'm lucky in that my brainfog-riddled brain forgets any spoilers and datamined "info" I might see
[1:19:01] Octopixy1971: yes exactly
[1:19:10] cashthb: wtf, I never meant to pay for this lame ass game, I just wanted my boy Bobby to be able to get his third yacht
[1:19:46] dicemeister23: Did you get the freehold mount this week?
[1:19:51] dvkJoe: dvkJoe is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to HazelNuttyGames's community! They've gifted a total of 105 in the channel! 
[1:19:51] Streamlabs: dvkjoe just gifted 5 Tier 1 subscriptions!
[1:19:51] dvkJoe: dvkJoe gifted a Tier 1 sub to Akitimtsu! 
[1:19:51] dvkJoe: dvkJoe gifted a Tier 1 sub to Kydar! 
[1:19:51] dvkJoe: dvkJoe gifted a Tier 1 sub to antiva! 
[1:19:51] dvkJoe: dvkJoe gifted a Tier 1 sub to fatstacksfeldrake! 
[1:19:51] dvkJoe: dvkJoe gifted a Tier 1 sub to factory398! 
[1:19:53] databob1: I would have been happy with a release date and some hype not the pirate flags on twitter some actual hype building
[1:19:59] dicemeister23: GRATS!!
[1:20:08] saga_no: But even if they did do that - they'd still keep the PTR up so you'd still be able to get some content out of that, I'd imagine :)
[1:20:14] apheelia96: Is there any word on when they next update is! Im impatient duckJam
[1:20:21] apheelia96: YES!!
[1:20:26] cashthb: I feel like there are less news about community stuff too, I really am curious about player numbers
[1:20:35] honeybun_games: honeybun_games subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! hai hey hallo!!! happy 33 months! still standing as my favourite Twitch streamer. Much love to you, Miss Kira, and Mr. Moose!! hazelLove hazelShiny
[1:20:35] Streamlabs: honeybun_games just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:20:50] 30avash: hey, I live in NA but have to play on EU and I refuse to start a new account on NA. do you think we would ever get region transfer?
[1:20:59] averageteacup: Reading internet comments in general is self-punishment :D
[1:21:06] jeffdmk: nope
[1:21:17] honeybun_games: how are you doing today? still cold on the west coast?
[1:21:40] jeffdmk: @30avash the clients are extremely different behind the scenes
[1:21:52] saga_no: WoW's been dying since Burning Crusade if we are to believe some of the OG players... LUL
[1:22:01] harrybabes: i personally follow and sub to you because of your unique style, delivery and positive outlook, even if your content changed i would remain invested in your content :)
[1:22:10] 30avash: @jeffdmk  how? why?
[1:22:31] ajeazy84: Exactly
[1:22:36] apheelia96: Why is it dying? they wanted classic and they got it! People complain too much. I love the game. If I was tired of it I would just not play. I dont have to ruin it for everyone who does like it
[1:22:36] cashthb: what if they gonna just lay off all their pirates? dunno where my good friend Baron Revilgaz will find a "pirate cove boss" opening nowadays
[1:22:41] anker_jym: I remember people freaking out when Shadowlands got delayed, despite the fact that WoW's very first expansion, TBC, was also delayed.
[1:22:58] DapherCake: If you didn't stream wow for your job would you still be playing wow ?
[1:23:09] ajeazy84: At this point I don't thing there is anything devs could do to please players
[1:23:18] incendiiary: I just got back into WoW for the first time since the start of BfA and felt kind of hostile towards the game during my time away, but being back now, holy cow is the game amazing! I wish I didn't take such a big break
[1:23:32] jeffdmk: I am online to change peoples minds about microwaves
[1:23:43] apheelia96: Right! I dont think anything would make them happy lol
[1:23:47] stephthebee: did you see stardew will be having a patch soon for switch?
[1:23:51] saga_no: @incendiiary I *started* playing in late BfA and they have changed _a lot_ since I started...
[1:24:01] honeybun_games: WoW's been different for me since I had a guildmate (ex guildie now) come out and call me nasty names and stuff. it's unfortunate, but the game has lost it's spark for me I guess
[1:24:32] databob1: No mircowaves macrowaves only
[1:25:20] Octopixy1971: hazelTen
[1:25:36] saga_no: As you should! Success comes in small doses.
[1:25:52] saga_no: So if you aim to mostly cook at home / from scratch - ...babysteps is the way to go
[1:25:58] Bronloch: just finished chorizo breakfast burritos Kreygasm
[1:26:00] honeybun_games: my partner has been on this money saving kick haha his current fixation is breaking down whole chickens because they're $7 at my work, I think that's too much effort lol
[1:26:32] shuffdub: congrats on sharkbait !! v happy for you
[1:26:33] saga_no: Uhm.
[1:26:36] saga_no: I know you didn'
[1:26:48] Octopixy1971: hahaha
[1:26:49] jeffdmk: how many water features do you want in your palace?
[1:26:58] anker_jym: So you want to be the Little Mermaid?
[1:27:20] honeybun_games: A waterfall that flows into an indoor river garden lmao
[1:27:23] saga_no: didn't flag for ADHD... but... it sounds like you might flag for some other stuff (that I'm familiar with) ...soo....... plans on further talks with mental health pros?
[1:27:30] cashthb: @honeybun_games 7$? yo a chicken breast cost more than that 'round here
[1:27:33] honeybun_games: if I'm going to be extra, I'd like to be extra with that xD
[1:27:37] Bronloch: yea a waterfall from the 2nd or 3rd floor would be amazing
[1:27:51] Elrathir: Hey, I've just hit 10 million gold in WoW for the first time and I feel good about that
[1:28:01] honeybun_games: @cashthb yup! a pack of 8-9 breasts is $34....
[1:28:16] Bronloch: i need to get something to make that water tinkling stream sound ambient in my background
[1:28:22] harrybabes: @Elrathir what was the main way you made gold?
[1:28:24] saga_no: Yeh, I was kinda struggling with the wording - ... heh - it was meant to be a question of continued research as opposed to "don't have that - stop all communication cold turkey with the person"
[1:28:25] Bronloch: i just realized i need that
[1:28:30] GreenArrowed: @Elrathir i'm taking donations for the poor warlocks fund if you're open to it
[1:28:31] kynlaeh: my partner gets 5 dollar rotisserie chickens from costco and meal preps with it
[1:28:31] anker_jym: Do you have a favorite brand of chicken replacement?
[1:28:38] Kiria16939: Hey Hazel, if you want, I have the mount, I could run with you for more chances
[1:29:11] anker_jym: Oh gotcha. If you never missed it, no need to replace it!
[1:29:13] kynlaeh: i like the buffalo chick pea burgers
[1:29:14] GreenArrowed: it's super greasy
[1:29:18] jeffdmk: would you eat lab grown meat?
[1:29:22] kynlaeh: i think it’s marketed to replace meat
[1:29:23] honeybun_games: all the veggies!
[1:29:51] tehl00py: so many lab grown fungi to eat
[1:29:54] honeybun_games: I miss cheese. had to go dairy free, the plant based cheese doesn't hit the spot the same way lol
[1:29:59] tehl00py: but it's mushrooms so it's ok
[1:30:08] Kiria16939: I have the mount if you want to have a higher chances at it?
[1:30:10] cashthb: would you eat a capybara tho? the catholic church classifies it as fish - or something like that, not sure 'bout the details
[1:30:18] witchhobbit: yeah that does sound better and i don't even like mushrooms that much
[1:30:45] Twigbot4k: Hiya Hazel!  Happy Thursday!  Week going well for you?  Any luck with mount drops?  hazelWave hazelPlant hazelLove
[1:31:08] KingWoozy: which dungeon/raid mount were you most excited to collect?
[1:31:09] witchhobbit: sairaLUL
[1:31:25] Zuldak: Sounds like you're eating thermometers lol
[1:31:28] saga_no: brb
[1:31:33] harrybabes: now we know what that aquarium is really for...
[1:31:41] harrybabes: hazelYikes
[1:31:48] Bronloch: many people in asia eat fish for breakfast
[1:31:55] Bronloch: lunch and dinner
[1:31:59] lazytitanex: Was there something that was hard for you to not eat when u became vegeterian?  I dont think i could ever not eat hamburgers.
[1:32:08] databob1: I like vegetarian food some times I even like tofu but I try to avoid animal product substitutes. they are overly processed and I don't like them
[1:32:20] Zuldak: I dont eat cooked fish:/
[1:32:51] Kiria16939: I have a lot of toons both sides...
[1:32:56] Anissa89: Hello cat anissa7Anissahi anissa7Anissalove
[1:33:01] Kiria16939: everytime I go with is another chance for you...
[1:33:02] witchhobbit: lol i had those issues too, when i didn't want to eat meat anymore at one point but i only wanted bacon and pepperoni/salami
[1:33:03] GreenArrowed: there are lots of vegan salumarias here in NYC
[1:33:12] kynlaeh: speaking of vegetarian foods, i’ve been vegetarian for years and just yesterday learned that some places call tofu bean curds. my partnered ordered me hot and spicy bean curds from a chinese restaurant saying i’ll like it and i was like the heck is a bean curd
[1:33:17] witchhobbit: people do rip you for that stuff
[1:33:30] Bronloch: omg pastrami on rye with pickles and cheddar and brown mustard Kreygasm
[1:33:36] Bronloch: or sourdough
[1:33:48] GreenArrowed: tofu is the curd of soy beans
[1:33:57] witchhobbit: i wanted to mostly eat vegan at one point but still have eggs and that was very offensive/weird to some lol
[1:34:00] lazytitanex: The other day my friend bought  some cheese for the vegetarian ppl at the party and everyone was like 'its so good
[1:34:04] cashthb: pepperoni and sasuages like that on pizzas are usually there for their fat tho
[1:34:06] lazytitanex: but I didnt like it lol
[1:34:18] witchhobbit: i have decided to not talk about diet with anyone except my partner now lol
[1:34:28] GreenArrowed: a lot of take out chinese places don't say tofu on the menu here
[1:34:38] Zuldak: Bean burgers are good in their own right
[1:34:51] honeybun_games: I surprisingly get a lot of judgement for being gluten free, lots of people just assume I'm doing it to be a fad, it's a bit annoying
[1:35:11] HiddenSquid188: I love that your cat has it back to the camera lol
[1:35:13] kynlaeh: i still get the “oh you’re still only eating veggies at thanksgiving”, it’s been 8 years lol idk why they’re surprised
[1:35:26] Talonias: I found a really interesting cheese yesterday. It is a black cheese with a hint of lemon
[1:35:36] witchhobbit: @honeybun_games i can imagine :(
[1:35:57] GreenArrowed: my favorite is "there's barely any meat in it"
[1:35:57] jeffdmk: stop judging the people that like dry chicken burgers
[1:35:58] cashthb: I remember asking before but I forgot what you said: did you ever cheat/what was the last time you ate meant?
[1:36:27] Kiria16939: @HazelNuttyGames have I offended you somehow by offering to help you get the mount?
[1:36:52] kynlaeh: unfortunately i live in a place where people make fun of or will vandalise vegan restaurants citing its ruining their farm business
[1:37:02] Bronloch: Hazel how do i run Stormsong dungeon in BFA with the lord and the underwater breathing part?
[1:37:06] kynlaeh: and my partner came from a farmer family and they don’t like i’m vegetarian
[1:37:14] Octopixy1971: @kynlaeh ahwww thats harsh
[1:37:34] honeybun_games: @kynlaeh that's so wrong on so many levels!
[1:37:38] Bronloch: it has some snag that i cant seem to finish it properly
[1:37:47] databob1: I have to deal with alot of diet restrictions and allergies in my friend group so I've had to become very versatile with my cooking
[1:37:47] jeffdmk: @Bronloch you basically are better off doing just about anything else
[1:37:56] anker_jym: @bronloch What's the snag?
[1:38:01] Bronloch: LUL
[1:38:08] kynlaeh: i think it was 2 years ago my partners dad was mad and put like tiny pieces of bacon in every veggie dish and when i ate a bit said oh so you can eat meat
[1:38:14] kynlaeh: but now it’s a bit better
[1:38:18] kynlaeh: thankfully
[1:38:27] honeybun_games: is the abyss wrom the one you decided on at the dentist the other day? lolol
[1:38:47] anker_jym: Did you consult your dentist first?
[1:38:49] Bronloch: i kill lord stormsong after he turns into the mindflayer and then it doesnt complete and i cant get the underwater breathing buff to make it to the final boss
[1:38:53] kynlaeh: how did the dentist go
[1:38:55] Kiria16939: @HazelNuttyGames I also have both the nighthold mounts from Guldan if you ever wanna try for those
[1:38:57] Bronloch: @anker_jym
[1:39:13] honeybun_games: WOW!! that's awesome
[1:39:18] ObsidianFire23: wow!
[1:39:21] kynlaeh: woww that’s nice
[1:39:36] anker_jym: @bronloch the best thing I can think of off the top of my head is running it on an Undead or a Warlock. Is there a specific loot drop you're going for?
[1:39:38] GreenArrowed: man, it's so nice to find a great dentist
[1:39:46] kynlaeh: i had one between my tooth one time and i don’t particularly like the wedge they use to get access
[1:39:49] GreenArrowed: it's such a yucky dr appt
[1:39:56] Revalya: @Bronloch as i remember you dont get a buff you just swimm to the endboss
[1:39:58] GreenArrowed: ahaha
[1:40:00] ObsidianFire23: 🤣🤣🤣
[1:40:08] cashthb: I never get numbed, pain loves me and I love pain
[1:40:11] Kiria16939: I am super fortunate that my VA dental team is great
[1:40:14] kynlaeh: they were prolly concerned you were having stroke symptoms
[1:40:20] harrybabes: lol
[1:41:09] GreenArrowed: i need to go, badly. i think 2 of my fillings are busted.
[1:41:17] cashthb: I'm not your age but I have way more than that
[1:41:26] databob1: @kynlaeh I had a friend that had a legitimate animal protean allergy that would have made her very sick.
[1:41:27] IAmScarlett__: it was my bday on monday and it went okay!!
[1:41:37] shuffdub: my teeth were awful when I was a kid, I have so many fillings and I have a crown , finally caught up on dental work
[1:41:41] GreenArrowed: i've got 6
[1:41:44] Kiria16939: I was fortunate to be super blessed, no cavities, no fillings, and only have to have cleanings every 6 months
[1:41:54] kynlaeh: my grandpa has none and my grandma has had many many many things done, which is where i get my teeth
[1:41:55] saga_no: ...aaaand back
[1:41:56] zannuss: I'm 40 and have had 2 root canals and 4 fillings. All done like 10+ years ago
[1:42:02] ghostie1995: I’m younger but I have a least three I think
[1:42:06] Bronloch: they need to hurry up with the tooth repairing toothpaste stuff that regrows enamel and fills in cavities SwiftRage
[1:42:08] IAmScarlett__: also hi chat hi hazel
[1:42:19] honeybun_games: the dentist is the one place I'm dreading to go to lol I need to find one soon though
[1:42:33] honeybun_games: @IAmScarlett__ hello!! happy belated birthday!! hope it was wonderful!
[1:42:43] zannuss: Maybe you eat a lot of food that is corrosive?
[1:42:45] kynlaeh: i have 4-5 i believe
[1:42:53] apheelia96: My sister brushed so often she brushed the enamel off her teeth
[1:42:54] kynlaeh: but i’m 22 so yikes
[1:43:08] kynlaeh: but i take care of my teeth
[1:43:08] GreenArrowed: i had 3 when i was little, then i got 3 more (and refilled the first 3) when i was like, 34. i'm pretty consistent with dental hygiene. my dentist said it's probably from the amount of seltzer i drink.
[1:43:18] eielwind: you should get gold fillings hazel
[1:44:02] shuffdub: dental work is my mortal enemy
[1:44:22] honeybun_games: Hazel PSA: listen to your dentist
[1:44:42] Zawyer: Just joined the stream. It will drop now, I feel it :)
[1:44:52] Bronloch: WDYM i did dental school and neurosurgery during night school at the YMCA LUL
[1:45:12] GreenArrowed: yah it's one of the new skins i think
[1:45:31] zannuss: How low is the drop chance on that mount?
[1:45:32] saga_no: I should be able to run this instance (LFR) at lvl60 right?
[1:45:40] GreenArrowed: darkglare is aff (and pvp) only i think
[1:46:05] Zawyer: a friend thought that about necrotic wake
[1:46:10] Zawyer: because he saw 2 mounts in his first 2 runs
[1:46:11] ajeazy84: Have you got the Antorus mount?
[1:46:15] zannuss: Yeah I got it within my first few kills when the raid came out and saw several drop. Probably not that low
[1:46:49] zannuss: I would gladly trade my antorus mount for the red polearm
[1:47:06] Iselinn: I had farmed The Ashes of Alar for ages.  I can't tell you how many boss kills.  This was back in the day.  My brother came with me for fun, teasing me that if he came with he was going to get it on the first try.  I'm sure you can guess what happened... *cryface*
[1:47:08] ghostie1995: shackled Urzul is on my wishlist
[1:47:14] saga_no: There's probably a fair amount of mog I'm missing from this... but I don't have lvl70s of that mog type ready to go (but a fair bit of 60+)
[1:47:25] cashthb: then you want start your arkham trilogy playtrough today? :(
[1:47:37] just_some_lady: this is reminding me i need to do my mythic mount farming in legion leeshPain
[1:47:38] Iselinn: I did get it 3 weeks after that at least ;p
[1:47:40] zannuss: I got ashes out of the timewalking box for killing illidan
[1:48:07] jordaddyxx: Didn't know you could get ashes that way
[1:48:13] eielwind: i got invincible from the timewalking box lol
[1:48:14] zannuss: and experiment 13b
[1:48:15] honeybun_games: I've tagged along with my partner for mount runs and I got Ji-Kun on the first try, never stepped foot into Throne of Thunder before... then farmed for Horridon, went along for the ride AGAIN one time , got the mount xD my partner was, unhappy xD
[1:48:31] eielwind: i see so many accounts of people who only kill alar for ashes then cry when theyre wrong lol
[1:48:36] cashthb: I heard you can get invincible from the lich king box too... I always forget to do it
[1:48:41] little_c2222: Honey wow
[1:49:00] luunarwow: Hi Hazel! did you get Sharkbait mount?
[1:49:03] jordaddyxx: I finally got the tusks of mannaroth after so long... The skip to garrosh was a blessing
[1:49:13] Saiyori: oh you got it?! congrats!
[1:49:13] HazelNuttyGames: !vods
[1:49:13] Streamlabs: you can watch full Hazel stream VoDs on YouTube! browse here https://www.youtube.com/@HazelNuttyVoDs
[1:49:24] zannuss: I've started my attempts at soloing nyalotha mythic, got everything but raden and the last 2. Raden has a 1 shot ability sadly
[1:49:28] Ujai321: wait, this is still lfr raids. what happened? did they get rid of instance cap?
[1:49:36] ajeazy84: My sister was farming icc for invincible for years not doing 25man heroic lol
[1:49:52] riffraff005: @ajeazy84 me too :(
[1:50:13] averageteacup: Looking so fabulous this Demon Hunter
[1:50:14] Ujai321: i wasnt, sadly. i had to eat something
[1:50:14] apheelia96: OK I can not find a head enchant in the auction house at all! What am I missing?
[1:50:43] msedup: uh.
[1:50:45] Zawyer: can be done on LFR, quite easy to do now
[1:50:48] apheelia96: ooof what raid?
[1:51:04] apheelia96: ok ty! I was so confused lol
[1:51:15] GreenArrowed: yea you just finish the raid questline
[1:51:31] zannuss: One of my big hopes with 10.2.6 is the pass on BFA raids to make them soloable. They said they wanted to do it before the end of Dragonflight and we know season 4 stuff is getting preloaded with that patch also.
[1:51:59] GreenArrowed: i forgot about that. i haven't started farming those at all.
[1:52:02] zannuss: nzoth mount
[1:52:14] everquest101: i been able to solo bfa on hc with  dk , nazja was kinda hard though
[1:52:18] riffraff005: can some explain in simple terms how raid skips work?
[1:52:28] Zawyer: isnt the gmod raid insanely buggy to solo/duo?
[1:52:33] saga_no: Speaking of - ...easiest / fastest way to get to Freehold as Horde? ( Would I have to initiate the War Campaign?)
[1:52:57] DapherCake: Hoping they remove that you need a clock for the nzoth mount lol
[1:53:15] riffraff005: ah ok, thank you! makes total sense
[1:53:17] eielwind: is the SoO available to everyone?
[1:53:19] just_some_lady: i wonder if they'll make ny'lotha doable without the legendary cloak
[1:53:19] Ujai321: i did like the nathria skip
[1:53:22] eielwind: (the skip)
[1:53:44] zannuss: I dont think you can even solo carapace or nzoth due to how they work
[1:53:55] GreenArrowed: i'm still working on the glory achievements for a few exp that have achievements that aren't quite soloable
[1:54:23] anker_jym: You are correct. You have to do it at least once per account
[1:54:26] pet_pepi_rus: you did the raid more than once, I was there
[1:54:34] saga_no: I think once on Normal or higher - so once you've gotten the achievement for first-time kill of the final boss in Siege, the skip is available
[1:54:55] pluuv94: i loved this raid
[1:55:01] saga_no: I know for a fact I've only done the whole Siege raid *once* ...and all my toons now have the skip
[1:55:07] anker_jym: Yo, Cata Classic Beta just dropped if anyone was interested
[1:55:15] Phenroi: They need to make all the raid skips account wide
[1:55:20] spivet: beware, if you farm a lot of mounts you might end up with a log full of "2/4 boss heads collected"
[1:55:25] Phenroi: And add more raid skips lol
[1:55:34] Rago602: Hey Hazel, I was wondering, do you have any recommendations for mouse and keypad substitutes? the ones on your amazon list are both discontinued afaik :[
[1:55:35] honeybun_games: mint flavoured dr pepper!?
[1:56:08] saga_no: @Rago602 For keypad, the option I use is the Razer Tartarus (and a Naga mouse)
[1:56:15] harrybabes: cata holds such a special place in my heart - its the first expansion i remember going to buy from gamestation after school harryb27KirbySobbing harryb27KirbyShowLove
[1:56:18] Rago602: i appreciate that regardless, thank you! <3
[1:56:22] Ujai321: so you will never recommend anything ever again, got it
[1:56:26] averageteacup: I'm excited for Cata but i wish the release it mid-April
[1:56:28] Redpandalol: Dr Pepper overall is s tier
[1:56:45] Rago602: @saga_no oh, thank you!
[1:56:59] Revalya: @saga_no  for you as horde to get to freehold fast (now with S3 theres a portal to the manor dungeon so thats quite fast) but yeah just start the campain in BfA just  so you can choose your first attack point in kul tiras and choose tiragarde
[1:57:03] zannuss: I got an older Logitech g190 and I cannot find a replacement for it that Ilike
[1:57:06] everquest101: my old compaq mechanical keyboard has 25 years and still working flawless after all massive pummeling
[1:57:11] zannuss: g91*
[1:57:15] zannuss: bah g910*
[1:57:16] Ujai321: right. no mice or keyboards, tho. you have a stockpile that should last a few decades
[1:57:21] zannuss: I cant type today apparently
[1:57:30] wolfcloudchaser80: Currently using that Corsair mouse. I like it. The MMO button grid on the side is adjustable! You can move it forward or back.
[1:57:44] harrybabes: i have a logitech g600 whcih i love
[1:57:48] saga_no: @Rago602 I have the V2 version of the Tartarus, so I'm not 100% what type of switch it uses - but it kinda sorta feels like mechanical
[1:57:58] Ujai321: "affordable, good, available. choose 2"
[1:58:00] zannuss: I got a Reddragon one from Amazon a few years ago that I love
[1:58:04] cashthb: who needs periferials anyway? jsut get a neurolink
[1:58:23] anker_jym: What about Hardcore HS Battlegrounds
[1:58:23] saga_no: @Revalya Ah... so I'd have to do a bit of BfA intro quests to get the initial War Campaign quest to pop too then...
[1:58:26] sence_00: vote sounds fun
[1:58:31] zannuss: but they discontinued it and I cant find a replacement with buttons where I like them. yeah its like 4 years old
[1:58:35] harrybabes: democracy!
[1:58:41] Rago602: Is your keybinding video for the mouse+keypad combo still up to date btw?
[1:58:42] Ujai321: what if i want Subnautica
[1:59:00] Rago602: @saga_no imma look into it VoHiYo
[1:59:04] wolfcloudchaser80: Timberborn?
[1:59:26] zannuss: I have the M902 model, I literally cannot found a mouse that has a button layout like it and its driving me nuts
[1:59:28] cashthb: I think my poll is buggy, I can't see the heroes 3 option
[1:59:41] Rago602: Oh, gotcha! Didn't know, how come you switched back to keyboard, if you don't mind me asking? :]
[1:59:44] lazytitanex: Im playing more heartstone, im learning to play it and get a deck together.
[1:59:50] saga_no: @Rago602 My disclaimer here is that I'm a Razer girlie - all my peripherals *and* my laptop is Razer, and I've had no issues with them at all - but I know others have had some issues with Razer stuff
[1:59:51] Ujai321: man, heroes 3 was great
[1:59:53] Revalya: @saga_no yeah there really fast to do on lvl 70 just do it to the point that you have to choose your first attack point, choose tiragarde and then to the quests there and then you can use your ship where nathanos is to talk with the captain and you will get to tiragarde
[2:00:00] anker_jym: Dangit, I'm losing lol
[2:00:37] lazytitanex: this is the one
[2:00:39] lazytitanex: we got it
[2:00:48] saga_no: @Revalya Yeah... I know; I have a couple of toons who haven't done any BfA at all, so I'd have to get the "welcome to whatever" achievement on them before I get the War Campaign quests
[2:01:00] Lluksobad: Cata Classic Beta is live, according to wowhead o-o
[2:01:01] nisuunlite: @zannuss razer naga trinity has a similar side panel which is exchangeable
[2:01:40] saga_no: ^- yep. I use the Razer Naga Trinity with the 12-button grid on the side
[2:01:41] zannuss: Its not the side panel thats the issue. Its the buttons next to the scroll wheel
[2:02:11] Revalya: @saga_no yeah then you have to do it :( but there is a option 1.5 XD if your toons dont need any professions take ingi with them so you can use the teleporter-toy :)
[2:02:27] lazytitanex: They may have lowered the drop of abyss worm mount, I remember everyone got it for Legion. It's just my impression tho.
[2:02:47] saga_no: @Revalya That is assuming I have the teleporter toy, though LUL
[2:03:34] zannuss: before this I had the wow legendary mouse for like 7 years so I have muscle memory to having a bind next to the scroll wheel
[2:03:42] Revalya: @saga_no  XD yes thats true but it should not cost so much so its another potion ^^
[2:05:45] ObsidianFire23: wb
[2:06:04] Ujai321: Subnautica won! what a surprise
[2:06:40] apheelia96: Classic is boring with all the walking ya gotta too. takes up to much time
[2:07:00] bellamii66: bellamii66 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[2:07:00] Streamlabs: bellamii66 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:07:01] Ujai321: ah, we are getting another spider to teach us how to bite better?
[2:07:22] Thaxorin: is this SoD?
[2:07:22] Ujai321: spiders dont even bite that well
[2:07:38] lazytitanex: spiders have fangs tho, right?
[2:07:54] Wolvnn: My cat woke me up at 5AM here in Australia, at least I get to catch a Hazel stream doogLaugh
[2:08:51] honeybun_games: move your feet lose your seat lololol
[2:09:07] Octopixy1971: oh she is so cute hazelShiny hazelTen
[2:09:08] anker_jym: Angry!!!
[2:09:15] honeybun_games: she's like mother why do do this
[2:09:46] Ujai321: how long would you stream from the floor then
[2:09:55] Hippwn: Is Kira friendly with other people or really just your girl
[2:09:56] Ujai321: if an hour is too long
[2:10:02] lazytitanex: ewww snakes
[2:10:26] Ujai321: "look at my snake! anyway, off to the spiders"
[2:10:33] cashthb: have you considered streaming while planking?
[2:10:34] honeybun_games: sweet baby lmao
[2:10:38] GreenArrowed: invader
[2:10:58] Ujai321: did she think he stinks as well?
[2:11:00] slagoroth: is this SOD?
[2:11:07] Ujai321: like she does with moose
[2:11:23] Ujai321: @slagoroth it's not. self-found HC
[2:11:25] AnarchyMoose: @slagoroth its self found hardcore
[2:11:40] Thaxorin: You learn skills faster
[2:12:03] adachi_akaso: how did you meet your partner if you don’t mind me asking
[2:12:08] Ujai321: like regular risky, or risky for your hc journey
[2:12:08] anker_jym: I always thought it was hilarious that there's an Orc named Doris
[2:12:08] cashthb: 1 silver, damn, Miss Rich
[2:12:22] AnarchyMoose: hazel, youre almost level 20. so close to your moun- oh wait
[2:12:48] Ujai321: halfway to the mount!
[2:13:05] AnarchyMoose: how crazy would it be if you could get a mount at level 20 in classic
[2:13:51] cashthb: just dragonride over the mountain
[2:14:21] anker_jym: Back side of the inn
[2:14:30] Ujai321: i think it's in the north?
[2:15:17] BoogiePonderosa: Tea it up!
[2:15:26] lazytitanex: dumb question, but why are u leaving ur pet?
[2:15:56] cashthb: @lazytitanex to get another one
[2:16:05] Ujai321: @lazytitanex she needs to tame another pet, to teach her current pet how to use its skills better
[2:16:22] lazytitanex: ohh only u can get one, I see.
[2:16:29] BoogiePonderosa: oh man.. i forgot about quivers
[2:17:12] lazytitanex: 'hey little spider, can u teach my big crocodile to bit?' haha
[2:17:20] lazytitanex: bite*
[2:17:41] BoogiePonderosa: i still think flying took away from immersion you'd get on the ground
[2:18:09] Ujai321: @lazytitanex technically, the spider teaches YOU how to bite better, so you can teach your crocodile
[2:18:27] Ujai321: which is just even better
[2:18:54] apheelia96: Do you have a Season of Discovery Character ?
[2:18:55] pancakemaster808: I'm a bite gamer on my cat
[2:19:30] apheelia96: It dont seem much different
[2:19:46] cashthb: so when cata will come you will no longer play hc? :O
[2:20:27] cashthb: I'm not testing it for free...
[2:20:41] lazytitanex: @Ujai321 Im just joking, I found it funny
[2:20:42] RTSLightning: Ohhh is Hazel going to play Cata?
[2:20:48] Solarwuf: grab the sunrock FP while you are there close by
[2:21:04] harrybabes: imagine if hardcore rules applied to pets too, if lola dies she dies forever :o
[2:21:08] Ujai321: good meme, streamer
[2:21:10] cashthb: maybe that grimm batol itch will get you
[2:21:10] apheelia96: Darkmoon Fair is up!
[2:21:31] RTSLightning: I'm so hype for Cata, I started there so it's my nostalgia bomb
[2:22:06] Rago602: just reminding you, in case you forgot, to change title
[2:22:07] apheelia96: I started in Burning Crusade
[2:22:08] RTSLightning: Firelands is such a good raid
[2:22:13] Ujai321: it's also not as bad as people say. it has a bad rep for the end
[2:22:19] cashthb: ngl you didn't miss our on anything GOOD
[2:22:30] pet_pepi_rus: i started in cata so i definetly wanna check it out
[2:22:37] BoogiePonderosa: Cataclysm: Hazel's Reckoning
[2:22:41] Rago602: cata added archeology, right?
[2:22:45] ghostie1995: I’m still doing pugs 😞
[2:22:49] RTSLightning: Archaeology was new
[2:23:06] lazytitanex: I remember when I first got my 1st computer I bought a cata disk, without realizing I had to pay a membership.I was like 16 years old lol
[2:23:17] cashthb: archeology for staff/zin'rokh, bot trash farm, getting all the reps up for epics
[2:23:26] RTSLightning: Hard Heroics were so cool
[2:23:29] BoogiePonderosa: i remember thinking it was weird to fight an entire battle on the back of a flying dragon
[2:23:32] harrybabes: reworked zul gurub and zul aman were so good, they were quite difficult
[2:23:41] finnybae: grim batol in the heroic dungeon finder WutFace
[2:24:13] anker_jym: I remember loving the prepatch events. Elemental invasions, Operation Gnomeregan, and the ever increasing frequency of earthquakes
[2:24:14] Hippwn: well it was also off the back of wrath dungeons at the end were insanely easy
[2:24:27] lazytitanex: yayy
[2:24:39] finnybae: gz! spoder hype
[2:25:21] cashthb: magmaw was insane, first bosses are free loot now adays, then there was magmaw being the toughest heal check we had prior mythic
[2:25:24] Solarwuf: don't forget to train growl
[2:25:34] harrybabes: to quote sylvanas "burn it" harryb27ReginaPhoneMad
[2:25:55] RTSLightning: Crowd Control is back baby
[2:26:14] RTSLightning: Bring a hunter you're gonna need those traps
[2:27:32] Rago602: have you considered doing pvp as of recent? i really liked your resto druid pvping way back
[2:27:40] cashthb: btw I think people will be really disappointed by the difficulty of cata rhcs
[2:28:06] Westtell401: what map addon is that
[2:28:06] Qpranger2: Qpranger2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[2:28:06] Streamlabs: qpranger2 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:28:23] RTSLightning: Yeah it'll be built up as something terrifying then like most Classic things we'll find out that we're just better informed these days
[2:28:46] RTSLightning: I hope they do, would be cool to see at least
[2:28:47] Solarwuf: lowest level mobs that has Bite lvl 4 is 24 in hillsbrad (again a spider)
[2:28:54] lazytitanex: poor spider
[2:29:48] zajberjompa: ooo L19 gj ;)
[2:29:57] pebblesenn: do you remember your first hunter pet ever?
[2:30:27] Westtell401: i believe its called tradeskill master
[2:30:56] BoogiePonderosa: there was an addon that used to recommend vendor/disenchant/ah...
[2:31:04] Westtell401: understandable
[2:31:08] cashthb: I don't think we got that much better, just people who were decent weren't complaining, so they didn't leave a mark; also there a lot of falsy myths arounf bosses, like how ozruks *15 yard* shatter was so very dangerous and shuch
[2:31:20] Westtell401: what map addon is that with heatmaps it looks like
[2:31:42] Westtell401: ooh ok cool thanks
[2:32:01] RTSLightning: People probably dying out here getting bored autorunning lol
[2:32:18] RTSLightning: LUL
[2:32:23] AztraTheSupermage: I remember my first hunter was called Megatron, and he had a scorpion pet called Scorponok.
[2:32:25] RTSLightning: I mean getting distracted and running into mobs
[2:32:40] RTSLightning: I'm a fan of the cross zone run
[2:32:43] Elrathir: hello you're my netflix on my second monitor
[2:33:01] BoogiePonderosa: i'm the one of those ppl that liked the running/meditative thing.. tho now i'm conditioned by flying so it feels slow now :\
[2:33:02] RTSLightning: Need an in-UI Netflix mod that pauses when you're in danger
[2:33:22] Ujai321: "man, you walked me all the way up here just to send me away again"
[2:33:36] Ujai321: do you know how hard it is to walk this long with 8 legs?
[2:33:39] cashthb: you're not cranking iron man when you're over taking someone?
[2:34:11] Solarwuf: you can also do stolen silver before the raptors to get the feather
[2:34:32] sence_00: I think the nests are near the bridge in the road south
[2:35:30] BoogiePonderosa: one fun thing before flying was figuring out how to reach the dwarven airport on top of Ironforge
[2:36:19] BoogiePonderosa: you fly over it on the flight path from IF to Menethil Harbor
[2:36:51] sence_00: stolen silver is big danger no?
[2:37:31] IAmScarlett__: hows ssf going for you?
[2:37:36] Solarwuf: stolen silver is good to do at lvl 19
[2:38:52] cashthb: you can nearly get the mace weapon training from that money!
[2:38:54] RTSLightning: Six Silver look out Moneybags on the plain rn
[2:39:14] cashthb: yeah, raelly
[2:39:36] Ujai321: halfway to the mount in level, but not quite in gold
[2:40:32] Ujai321: you dont now how clever these raptors are, how dare you call them dense
[2:41:10] sence_00: my original HC toon died in here because of respawns
[2:42:11] Elrathir: I think you should drink even more before charging headlong into the raptors :)
[2:42:44] Solarwuf: With your Strider meat you can make Strider Stew (+4Stam +4Spirt), the [Recipe: Strider Stew] can you get in the cross roads from Tari'qa (also still red skill at 81)
[2:43:27] Alastree: Hi Hazel
[2:43:45] GreenArrowed: barrens feels scary
[2:43:59] GreenArrowed: i just remember pulling so much random stuff
[2:45:28] Thames: Xroads innkeeper has the apples.
[2:45:44] secretmilkshake: this makes me want to try hardcore classic.
[2:45:58] cashthb: why do you need apples for a stew anyway? isn't it more of a ragout at that point?
[2:46:13] anker_jym: Hazel, my wife just sent me a video of child number 2 crawling!!! Been trying to get him there for weeks now
[2:49:24] sence_00: do you have a link or preset for your HC UI? I cant for the life of me get these addons to work
[2:49:37] jamien_10: I usually level paladin but I'm giving a hunter a go this time
[2:49:38] anker_jym: So what you're saying is you want to try Warrior next?
[2:50:10] Solarwuf: shammies are fun to do in SSF
[2:50:11] cashthb: well, hutners dps output is tied to your bow
[2:50:12] Perkolate: those warriors died so bopsy could fly
[2:54:19] Perkolate: you're rich!
[2:54:39] cashthb: Hazel, you're cool, don't come to camp taurajo during the expansion after the next 2 expansions
[2:54:41] gordastico: what do you think strider meat tastes like?
[2:55:14] Alannalouwho: loooove your hair!
[2:55:23] GreenArrowed: ostrich
[2:55:50] MAXXtheFiXer: Hi, Hazel what is the name of the bag-addon that you use??
[2:56:13] MAXXtheFiXer: Thanks!
[2:56:24] wolfcloudchaser80: Just started using BetterBags myself. I like it.
[2:56:52] Alannalouwho: ty for streaming! <3
