[2:05:07] Walord81: from a standpoint of  interface and professions etc it all went wrong after this one
[2:05:19] imstillheretho: Thats not because it was the best, but because blizzard didnt have as much money to advertise it, dont you remember all the ads with celebrities back in the day?

[2:05:49] Walord81: yup
[2:06:06] imstillheretho: The only reason WOTLK is more popular than TBC is because it took a while for people to realize this game exists
[2:06:11] ozzymagnum: 10k on my server
[2:06:15] Thunder_God_Bane: @imstillheretho celebrities are not the reason wow had 12mil subs lool

[2:07:07] ggwp_wws: @Swifty summon me
[2:07:38] chiipoo: @imstillheretho no, its because wotlk pvp is the best thing out there :D

[2:11:44] imstillheretho: @Thunder_God_Bane i agree that talent and class changes are nice, but that is all and a lot of things are IMO worse than TBC
[2:11:53] AinaTan3: immersion broken
[2:11:53] warlorlorlock: wait.. you aren't in SW right now?!?1
[2:12:22] Thunder_God_Bane: @imstillheretho nah then theres accessibility next. Wrath made raiding an dungs alot easier for casuals. TBC was catered to the hardcore
[2:12:35] Thunder_God_Bane: Thats why subs flew up to 12mil
[2:12:50] Thunder_God_Bane: it catered to casuals an im a casaul too

[3:17:18] Tolaarn: i'm sure you can, as long as the oculus software is running in the background it should work, just need to download steam vr to make the connection work
[3:17:20] Nivekpro: Well if you lose your steam account you lose all your games

[3:18:38] Sheepishguy273: but if you been scamming with said account then its lost
[3:18:48] tonycollazo1961: I just looked up the statement about steam owning games: You do not own your games. Whether bought through Steam, Origin, or any other digital download service that requires a live account to play them, you are at best renting those games, with no guarantee that you'll be able to continue to do so.
[3:19:20] stefanblagojevic: yes its better
[3:19:23] LordChen7: you mean like old people playing solitaire all day? or us playing oldies for nostalgia? wrong.

[3:20:53] lankie101: So that does make sense, it will make less likely that people do cheating. Still its weird that you don't own it
[3:20:55] coconust1: what
[3:21:00] Suptra07: you actually just bought the right to play the game
[3:21:03] Suptra07: you didnt buy the game
[3:21:10] LordChen7: GoG mostly has the same prices and sales like Steam. And, with GoG, they let you download the installer. Which will work forever
[3:21:14] patiszerg: If steam servers go down though how would you play the game?
[3:21:15] BlitskriegWar: I guess you could say it is like paying for the right to watch a movie

[3:23:55] tonycollazo1961: You don't own the game when you buy it on CD/DVD either, you only own the CD/DVD itself.  You've got a license to use the software on the CD/DVD, same as you've got a license to use the software on Steam or anything other digital platform.  It's just easier to enforce the terms of the license, including changing the software, on a digital platform than it is in regards to physical media.

[5:35:12] udderlyepicgaming: They use quick pulses for letters and numbers. A=1, etc. So moving a knight from B2 to C4 would be 2-2:3-4. It’s unfathomable to process it unless you’re trained for it, especially in timed games like they play, but it’s plausible. Especially with money involved.
[5:35:42] baraktus: are u guys going naxx
[5:35:58] CrunkyBrewster: ah is Naxx is out today eh

[8:09:10] azaruuu: precast* heals
[8:09:25] azaruuu: instead of trying to dps
[8:09:27] vanillasky7788: precast yeah in crit moments
[8:09:47] vanillasky7788: but u also can help with dmg when nothing to do and ur group is top
[8:09:56] Pallyofhell: swifty no
[8:10:01] vanillasky7788: @azaruuu
[8:10:02] Pallyofhell: aura doesnt stack with the buff
[8:10:14] Pallyofhell: you should be using fire resist aura
