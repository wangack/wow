[1:46:59] whyknee: sstvWAT rollipClap
[1:47:09] orangemaple24: if you get plugs you have to take it still or you lose the new hair
[1:47:10] Koshintu: its funny looking at bald people pretending not to be bald pepeLaugh
[1:47:17] Motelguy: Finasteride actually most likely increases testosterone but lowers body DHT which is the main cause of Male pattern baldness. Some people have side effects from lower DHT
[1:47:17] schmo4: stone cold gold brother, bald and proud
[1:47:27] R1ch3n: fat ring

[1:48:14] Motelguy: Finasteride is required after hair transplant so we know uncle Elon is taking Finasteride KEKL
[1:48:18] Koshintu: genetics is the main cause lul
[1:48:48] crackerssx: i did turkish plugs no u dont need finasteride
[1:48:56] MisterMeowgi_: The best solution is being comfortable with going bald
[1:49:01] Lionkingler1: you gonna need some adrenochrome
[1:49:16] zridex: the plugs itself dont fall out because they're DHT resistant follicles, however u are gonna continue to bald "behind" front wall of your freshly implanted plugs
[1:49:22] Ravyga: Warrior is Leather Set YEP
[1:49:40] zridex: so if u get a hair transplant u ought to start finasteride so u wont look like an idiot in 5 years
[1:49:40] LoRswat: speaking of Elon...he's meeting with Trump in Palm Beach soon....to discuss becoming a campaign donor...so is the word on the street.  He voted Biden in 2020.  So, I'm not sure how accurate that is.
[1:49:53] Punchatron5000: yes old hear keeps falling out
[1:50:02] weebpulper: can I get a scalp replacement instead of hair plugs?
[1:50:12] Koshintu: like a hair subscription pepeLaugh
[1:50:17] VegaCP: @kobbi12345 they just move your own hair, it's not ahkmed's hair
[1:50:18] Scaleless1776: as a Paladin I always wear plate or mail regardless of what‚Äôs bis
[1:50:20] zridex: u cant get infinite plugs, u have 100k follicles on your head and you have 10k follicle bank on the back of your head. so you can replace only 10% of your hair
[1:50:22] ryufromstreets6: hair transplant is such a massive cope, just let it go
[1:50:29] Valencia_Pete: @weebpulper i can do that... for money
[1:50:35] weebpulper: I'll just get a new scalp EZ

[1:52:04] stankypanky22: maybe warlock is hard
[1:52:21] eggsmasher: how can you tank it right tho ? if you solo tank it :P
[1:52:21] Prdek2: Enha tank is basically only one that can comfortably solo tank menagerie
[1:52:23] Lionkingler1: it frees up an off tank to actually dps

[4:18:06] dirbagdan: @STREAMSNIPELUL On another note, though, I don't actually think China and the USA, and even Russia are even enemies in the slightest. Politics  is theatre. Those in charge are all friends and the same goals in mind. The rest is for us.

[4:22:29] voreal22: oof
[4:22:34] SmokeyZugs: It's a really bad look
[4:22:35] dirbagdan: There have been hints at cyber attacks for years. There's been movies depicting internet collapse. There's a lot of predictive programming around the whole subject. Even a new movie coming out called civil war. Even our buddies at the WEF have been talking about a computer virus that behaves like covid OMEGALUL
[4:22:47] Nytsongx: i dont think the US will ever see another president assassination
[4:22:56] the_bhagwan: yeah imagine china making a virus to kill the world and then putting out a computer virus that does the same
[4:23:09] mysteriousm4n: we should vote him in again just out of spite
[4:23:27] kalex214: 9-0 let‚Äôs go

[4:23:30] jimmypepper26: @Nytsongx it happened in a first world country like japan recently i dont think its impossible.
[4:23:43] jordano111: LUL the people who own the world own him they are both sides of the same coin
[4:23:47] brentosxd: If that happens in a 2024 setting the world explodes no
[4:23:52] Nytsongx: @jimmypepper26 bro theres a reason why i said in the US.. im not talking about japan
[4:24:09] MajurDJ: have you guys seen the trailer for the movie coming out about a modern day US civil war?
[4:24:19] yados: Japan can't compare to what the secret service does imo.. tbh
[4:24:44] yados: Trump is safe imo
[4:24:48] HotFlatDietPepsi: He can pull a Putin and find his own Medvedev
[4:24:50] Wingsofjanitor: the narrative right now is that if he wins he will become dictator HotPokket
[4:24:51] dirbagdan: @MajurDJ Yeah. more predictive programming

[4:26:03] the_bhagwan: The US is a dictatorship under the Federal Reserve
[4:26:12] BinksMagnus: @Krex0r traditionally dictators have invoked divine right for their absolute power, so they usually had the consent of the people through their belief in God
[4:26:13] mysteriousm4n: even North Koreans know they have a dictator
[4:26:18] Plathyy: shrimp salad for dinner FeelsOkayMan
[4:26:34] Krex0r: What do you think about Trump wanting presidents to have immunity? What does this mean?
[4:26:39] Scaleless1776: communist pos are dictators
