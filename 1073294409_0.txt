[1:57:00] Hathyn: Even if Max went to a top guild. It would take weeks to get the entire team used to his style of raid leading. It's a group synergy
[1:57:04] Wulfgrym: sco can rebuild a team, but it will take time, max would have to take time to do the same
[1:57:05] MizixTV: Max doesn't even raid in the Race...

[2:23:06] Mackadeus: Phone call making me late to the convo. The thing hurting my head with the dreadlords is The Jailer puppeteered Denathrius to send out the dreadlords, one of which made Arthas what he is (LK), which in turn gave the Jailer arguably his greatest ally (Sylvanas). It's just mind boggling to think that the Jailer through the dreadlords has been the one orchestrating so much in WoW.
[2:23:13] KragnosWoW: Yeah it said ETA July 6th when i ordered
[2:23:18] Aquadriel: theres bitches and hoes
[2:23:50] kirtyalex: same with nzoth LULW

[2:26:24] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee for the raid what leggo will you be using on your bear?
[2:26:58] I_DoctorSatan_I: so, recommended Layer 9 is 208, but Layer 10 is recommending 223....15 ilvl increase?...that's a significant jump.
[2:27:18] Skylin3r: I still think blizz pushed 9.1 early cause of the momentum FFXIV is getting
[2:27:22] MrKhanes: I started to watch Cohh during Archeage alpha, it was amazing to watch him Ellohime and Bikemand stream that game.
[2:27:40] Mackadeus: Fun fact the Box upgrades are shared between people. I took the blessings and my wife took the torment reduction and when we queue together we see both Box upgrades. Makes Torghast more fun w/ friends.
[2:27:44] aeyt: I completed every floor at 100% yet only got 4 stars, so how are you supposed to get 5?

[2:28:52] Arbalann: buy stuff first
[2:29:00] DaMotorBoater: ya u can ravenous anima him too
[2:29:03] sl1nky1981: Yup, buy stuff then kill
[2:29:05] Arbalann: then kill him, he drops a few anima powers
[2:29:14] griiffinnn: u buy from him then kill him
[2:29:20] plankdemi: I wish wow people stopped promoting ff14
[2:29:23] Mackadeus: @Towelliee Buy first then kill. Gives an anima orb, 2 rare powers a ravenous cell and the 25% DPS pot
[2:29:25] MuttonChopins: I think cohh will really like ff14
[2:29:36] DehCantao: @plankdemi why?
[2:29:47] Gingerprimer: @aeyt wowhead has an article on the scoring system but the big thign is doing big scores thing with the buff active since you get 2x score from it
[2:30:00] Thoreya: @plankdemi they play FF but are in every wow twitter tweet or stream LUL
[2:30:04] Thoreya: oddest shit ive ever seen

[2:30:09] NovaKhane: didnt cohh start off streaming playing ff14
[2:30:10] Alienfromger: imagin asmon playing ff14 and skipping all cutscenes LUL
[2:30:13] plankdemi: because more people will leave wow
[2:30:22] plankdemi: sheep will follow
[2:30:26] racketpunch: It’s too bad Torghast doesn’t have a noticeable difference in look between layers
[2:30:31] Mackadeus: One thing Cohh has going for him compared to like Asmon playing FF14 is his community seems to be supporting him quite a bit

[2:31:31] Nehcrom: Cohh is hardcore player.
[2:31:34] DehCantao: @plankdemi tbh I think it was expected. I started playinf ff months before the famous streamers, because I had nothing to do in WoW. So maybe ppl "switch" because they want.
[2:31:35] Endin: he really does not like it, if you have ever watched cohh you know this :)
[2:31:38] MrKhanes: Cohh loves mmos in general but not WoW.
[2:31:40] MuttonChopins: he said one of the reasons is because he doesn't like the graphics

[2:31:52] tebbix: @KingSlayerYotam yeah good move for Annie
[2:31:55] DarkenedHour97: Are you playing the AOC alpha @Towelliee ?
[2:32:12] Fannman21: do you think asmon will like FF @towelliee ?
[2:32:14] Arbalann: you get 10 points for not getting hit by any traps
[2:32:17] DehCantao: @sl1nky1981 +1 I still dont understand why ppl say "this or that"
[2:32:23] Crow_Bot: It's a floor only Admiral Ackbar would love
[2:32:41] userrx: So i need 160 score to play L10 next week ?
[2:32:42] KingSlayerYotam: @tebi1997 anniesCozy

[2:34:15] DehCantao: I had 2 full wipes cause my group was trolling and having fun and still got 194 points.
[2:34:20] Aquadriel: is that account wide?
[2:34:28] Aquadriel: or do i need 4 on each alt
[2:34:34] I_DoctorSatan_I: is it as long as you get a 4 Star on one wing, will it count unlocking for next week's Layer 10?
[2:34:44] I_DoctorSatan_I: for both?

[2:35:35] Phantom_wulfstan: i do not understand why people use twitch as a metric at all
[2:35:37] Saakki: Can you keep farming the tower dust stuff for the talents? or is it only once per tower part
[2:35:37] sl1nky1981: @DehCantao exactly. There seems to be this feeling that you're only allowed to like one or the other. I enjoy FFXIV for different reasons than WoW. And the break from WoW reinvigorated my enthusiasm to play WoW.
[2:35:46] therobbomega: @Fannman21 I am not TRowilee heh, but I honestly think Asmon at best will be neutral to FF XIV, especially since he is going to need to spend 60+ hours in ARR if he is going to not skip and try to level all the way to end game as he says. That is literally going to take him months since he is still playing WoW and trying other games like New World, Ashes, etc. Asmon has said plkenty he doesn't really care about the stories in MMOs, he doesn't like the graphical style or the characters, and I m

[2:36:03] Mackadeus: @Saakki If you mean the tower knowledge for the Box you can get a total of 180 this week. Goes up each week.
[2:36:15] KragnosWoW: when WoW is in a drought I just play other genres like League of Legends, Valorant, etc
[2:36:24] Saakki: @Acarnis ah okay ty!
[2:36:43] RocketMan23: FF isnt entertaining to watch outside of maybe raids, there is sooooo much dialogue its zzzzzz
[2:36:46] Wheeellz: ff has even less content than wow at end game it will never hold any wow streamer
[2:37:00] Phantom_wulfstan: i rather they remove the pvp its a waste of resources
[2:37:01] CrUziE06: and some single player games. It's nice to play a singleplayer game and get lost in that world for a bit.
[2:37:04] CADZtv: @drippzsy she's playing it cause people have to sub to her to get a mount
[2:37:12] manmower: $
[2:37:12] tebbix: Do you think Blizzard is feeling pressure about FF14 ? @Towelliee
[2:37:16] CADZtv: not the same
[2:37:19] MarquisLek: she into that anime stuff
[2:37:19] Drippzsy: @CadzFPS :D
[2:37:24] Artenuous: she's also getting like 3x the viewers she usually gets as well
[2:37:31] therobbomega: yea, FF XIV is a hard game to watch on twitch honestly. I enjoy playing it personally, but its hard to watch a stream of it
[2:37:37] Olivermikael: wow is a honeymoon phase game :D
[2:37:41] Aquadriel: annie been sponsored for a while with ff14, though she is liking the game at least.
[2:38:02] plankdemi: why didnt you buy 5 phantasma core?
[2:38:23] IianaDRK: stuns aoes when u get hit

[2:38:31] Bayne77: you used to be able to throw that 250 orb at the broker vendor and get 400 back
[2:38:46] gfield2k: @Towelliee is another part of torghast now. The faster you do it the more points you get towards getting a flawless
[2:38:57] MizixTV: So.... just crafted a Leggo and it didn't socket... thought they were supposed to socket now...
[2:38:58] Mackadeus: Put 700h into FF14 during Covid. My problem is their end game content. Charge a sub but then it eventually plateaus. At least in WoW I can farm M+ or PvP with my friends instead of each major patching just being more MSQ.
[2:39:02] domnero: @Towelliee obleron bonuses, like crit, mastery, crit dmg, etc
[2:39:04] gfield2k: opps forgot the word time @Towelliee
[2:39:05] forcegamerrr: Obleron armaments? That's basic stat amps
[2:39:10] nubsauce13: the 3 powers you just got @Towelliee
[2:39:27] jberry: @towelliee a guildy told me you can keep running torg for ash?
[2:39:45] MizixTV: @jberry yes
[2:39:58] MizixTV: but you wont get as much as you got for your first run
[2:40:21] therobbomega: Zepla made a crap ton too

[2:42:44] Ertra: if you die, does it become impossible to get a rank 4 or rank 5 score?
[2:42:58] raldrik: prot pally test right here
[2:43:14] Recaud: Tauren cannot be rogues... they're too good to be playable.
[2:43:22] Mackadeus: Would love to know exactly what I'm doing wrong lol. Leveled through the story (loved it btw), completed the current savage content, didn't enjoy PvP so here I am back on WoW instead for now and am happy doing it. I don't think FF14 is a bad game at all, I just think with some people's (mine) level of time playing it doesn't have enough to justify a sub to me.
[2:43:32] MizixTV: @Towelliee I crafted Pants cause the other 2 pieces for my BiS leggo will have Dom Sockets
[2:43:52] N3llee: wouldnt have crafted pants
[2:43:56] N3llee: you fucked yourself
[2:44:03] I_DoctorSatan_I: @MizixTV pants is not part of the socket gear when you craft them
[2:44:08] akia03: no socket or dom piece in pants
[2:44:10] aikopooh: neck/rings is best to go
[2:44:15] Gingerprimer: @MizixTV for what leggo?
[2:44:19] Wheeellz: @Acarnis You're not doing anything wrong. Savage content and Ultimates are the only real endgame in FF don't listen to people trying to tell you otherwise
[2:44:25] SquidgyTTV: The lack of cutscenes I’m ff14 like just cut out some of that dialogue lol
[2:44:27] MizixTV: @Gingerprimer Rylak
[2:44:41] I_DoctorSatan_I: helm, neck, ring, bracers..
[2:44:42] Dalsonson: Pants don’t have dom sockets, it’s Helm/Shoulders/Chest and 2 more depending on armor type yea?
[2:44:43] griiffinnn: does anyone know if you can send soul ash to alts yet? or is that timegated?
[2:44:58] akia03: @Dalsonson yep
[2:44:58] nubsauce13: @griiffinnn its gated to 44 renown
[2:45:02] therobbomega: @Acarnis well, Warcraft is basically designed completely for the end game, so yeah it actuall has more stuff to do once you get there like Torghast, Maw stuff, world quests, dailies, weeklies, stuff for vault, and more robust PvP. In FF i usually spend like 1/2 my day leveling other jobs and glammors
[2:45:10] griiffinnn: thank you @nubsauce13 !

[2:46:28] akia03: @Gingerprimer no domination sockets on pants
[2:47:05] Horseweave: @acarnis I guess I'm not in the same mindset anymore. WoW lost my interest simply because they stopped carrying about their game as a whole. FF14, to me, is just slow and steady, for a full experience.
[2:47:07] I_DoctorSatan_I: Hunters are going to want to save their back for her cloak tbh, its the Quiver + Bow meta
[2:47:43] Draz3nx: nerf prot pally 8.1 k dps
[2:47:57] therobbomega: oof :(

[2:48:30] MoeScams: what score do you have to get to progress
[2:48:31] Arbalann: You get a lot of extra points for killing the bosses faster and for killing two elites at the same time
[2:48:37] MizixTV: but Pants don't get a socket
[2:48:39] Scoodles91: run a 9 again
[2:48:41] paradoxyy: just do a 3 or smg
[2:48:42] paradoxyy: and u get it
[2:48:44] navs_oce: another
[2:48:45] Zettabyte: nein
[2:48:46] Dalsonson: More Torghast
[2:48:49] MizixTV: so I get fucked by my spec.... lol
[2:48:49] nubsauce13: any layer
[2:48:58] griiffinnn: u can do any layer
[2:49:02] xch4se: Is it 4 on each or just 4 on 1?
[2:49:02] paradoxyy: i just did a layer 1 and i got it
[2:49:11] I_DoctorSatan_I: Layer 10 is next week
[2:49:16] The_MajesticTurnip: @MizixTV hpals bis lego doesnt get sockets either
[2:49:17] Mallaes: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
[2:49:22] navs_oce: if u want more ash do 9, otherwise doesnt matter layer lvl
[2:49:37] MizixTV: @The_MajesticTurnip lol thats my old Main lmao
[2:49:43] Wheeellz: @MizixTV how exactly are you getting fucked
[2:50:07] MizixTV: @Wheeellz because every other class gets a socket on the leggo and I don't?
[2:50:35] therobbomega: we all are a little insane
[2:50:36] Wheeellz: @MizixTV you still get the same amount of sockets as every body else
[2:50:42] Jyckle: lol would rather grind WoD
[2:50:49] Wheeellz: its the same gain regardless of where you put it
[2:50:50] MizixTV: @Wheeellz How so?
[2:50:53] Dalsonson: WoD was fine lol
[2:50:54] Blvdman: torghast runs if ur a sham is like 30mins max

[2:52:20] knicknack92: Is there already a new leggo recommendation? I thought it would be next week when the raids out
[2:52:30] N3llee: Arent bracers part of the new socket set bonus thing?
[2:52:31] Mecabeast: you could start anywhere if you have the ash
[2:52:42] akia03: @Towelliee no bit without a domination socket for your lego?
[2:52:46] WnbSami: not for leather
[2:52:47] Wheeellz: @MizixTV the only thing you DONT get is a FREE socket
[2:52:51] Todmeister9000: @Towelliee what is Kael'thas doing in Korthia?
[2:52:52] z01z: i went straight to 235 on alts just so i didnt have to buy all the crafted pieces
[2:53:04] Marine_eniram: what is a domination socket?
[2:53:14] N3llee: o wow bracers are domination socket for dk
[2:53:14] CADZtv: socket
[2:53:20] MizixTV: @Wheeellz didn't think you could socket a piece that has a Dom socket
[2:53:20] pavepawns: i find it weird we cant apply a dom socket to legendaries
[2:53:37] TriumphantToad: does blizzard even play their game? who makes this shit?
[2:53:38] TheNoidd: dont you get a socket when you upgrade it now though? i thought they had a blue post
[2:53:40] therobbomega: woah oh oh sweet child o mine
[2:53:48] N3llee: new borrowed power
[2:53:50] Recording_on_the_grass: why is there hardly any rares
[2:54:00] Bladeheart_91: What are the other two slots for leather? Cause It's Helm, Shoulders and Chest for everyone right?
[2:54:02] skiller2b_: Why Shadowlands has to suck so much, oh man, I had such high hopes for this... BibleThump
[2:54:03] KingSlayerYotam: another shit grindy system for blizz to balance
[2:54:10] Dalsonson: Upgrades are a yes
[2:54:13] Horseweave: @acarnis Another reason I like FF14 > WoW: Their loot system actually WORKS.
[2:54:14] knicknack92: So sockets are new BIS?
[2:54:27] aeyt: how much does first clear of l9 give soul ash?
[2:54:29] DaMotorBoater: LFR farm?
[2:54:39] TheNoidd: so much for no new systems
[2:54:46] The_MajesticTurnip: onhly raiding? well screw us casuals that dont have the time for raiding...
[2:54:49] Wheeellz: @Horseweave spare me....ff has the most boring loot system
[2:54:50] KVANNORWICK: You get a socket when you craft a new leggo but not if you upgrade one that doesn’t currently have a socket.
[2:55:02] Bladeheart_91: You also need a specific gem in a specific slot for the bonus I read. Like for Unholy, you need an unholy gem in the Helm slot.
[2:55:10] The_Wicked_Viking: I hate all these systems
[2:55:16] TriumphantToad: they should find another way

[2:55:57] swordart_19: bye whining boomers
[2:56:00] xxplicitt: They just need a couple of good systems they don't have to go all in like this
[2:56:05] KVANNORWICK: The difference between this and BfA is that they pushed all the systems in the opening patch rather than adding systems in each patch.

[2:56:09] Mr_Hasselhoff: It's what people want

[2:56:24] stealthx23: doesnt need a million different currency's tho

[2:56:59] Todmeister9000: every patch, new systems, new currencies, my head is gonna explode
[2:57:09] D3mitr1: yep that's the one
[2:57:09] Aquadriel: yeah
[2:57:13] Electafuzz: deep focus is best for feral
[2:57:18] iblighters: yup best for ST and catweave
[2:57:21] Annyongg: cat weave? odd.
[2:57:43] D3mitr1: if u call it off it's big damm
[2:57:52] Blvdman: WoD only flaw was no M+
[2:57:55] Naturalbeef: Let's be honest, it doesn't matter what they do. The Wow community is insufferable
[2:57:55] Cryttan: They can have a lot of systems, but for gods sake make sure they're good systems. Not a bunch of necessary farms.
[2:58:00] TriumphantToad: i don't think people are asking for NO systems, just LESS
[2:58:16] MoeScams: whats the cap for earning cinders this week?
[2:58:27] therobbomega: or systems that can be built on in the next expansion, not a system that just stays for a patch then goes away and replaced by something else
[2:58:28] IianaDRK: it increases in cap like valor does
[2:58:28] Blvdman: apparently 220
[2:58:35] Greyborn1: @Towelliee I do like the box of many things
[2:58:39] Bladeheart_91: I'm just tired of everything being time gated to hell and back.
[2:58:42] Olivermikael: 1709
[2:58:44] Olivermikael: 170
[2:58:44] WonderMog: I just wish they would of kept the weapon system. I think legion was an amazing expansion
[2:58:57] MuttonChopins: have you seen the jesse cox video about ff14 and wow @Towelliee
[2:59:01] Blvdman: I'm missing the maw shit
[2:59:02] Wheeellz: @therobbomega if you do that you alienate new or returning players
[2:59:07] therobbomega: @WonderMog yeah, i think there definitely could have been a way to build on that
[2:59:08] aeyt: true KEKW
[2:59:12] Cryttan: Maybe they could update current systems aswell, like the PvP gearing is already super outdated and this is just the first patch. There is zero point in farming bg's for honor gear now. It's waaay to underleveled compared to m0 gear now.
[2:59:18] D3mitr1: what rank you just crafted?
[2:59:27] YellowFlag: Just got KSM finally
[2:59:33] Aquadriel: the other weekly assault will give more?
[2:59:41] Aquadriel: like, will there be another assault?
[2:59:43] mavericks312: wow can drop another legion quality xpac next and ppl would still complain
[2:59:45] Algfader: Shadowlands? thx Obama...
[2:59:56] D3mitr1: I dunno why that change
[3:00:03] paradoxyy: Anyone knows when can we fly finally?
[3:00:12] Algfader: next week
[3:00:17] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee just sent you a screenshot in disc, i just got a flawless run on floor 9 upper reaches
[3:00:20] WonderMog: @therobbomega Legion was the most fun I had since wrath. just felt good. had flaws but not many. they could of not fixed what wasn't broken, and just did a few changes
[3:00:21] Nurutooo: @paradoxyy renown 44 and you get flying
[3:00:28] therobbomega: @Wheeellz maybe, new players don't know anything different, so explaining a system to them as they level I think would be perfectly understandable
[3:00:33] devoted_bee: "So anyways, I started thrashing."
[3:00:37] paradoxyy: @Nurutooo Thank god,thanks
[3:00:47] r0b928: How am I not a follower right now? I’ve been subbed for 3 years
[3:00:50] Nurutooo: @paradoxyy or so i heard you get it
[3:00:56] therobbomega: that can be built on in the future
[3:01:18] veubenta: not with that attitude mister
[3:01:22] Wheeellz: @therobbomega yeah but if you have an easy catchup for new players or returning players then the people that grinded or worked on said system before hand feel like they did that work for nothing....its a lose/lose for blizz

[3:02:01] MuttonChopins: why did they take off death counters?

[3:02:10] Wesley1213: It is still in the twisting corr.
[3:02:10] Manabucho: there is a new death counter, that gives you negative score
[3:02:14] knicknack92: Do deaths impact score?
[3:02:15] dreamwalker213: It’s just effects your score now
[3:02:20] Wheeellz: @therobbomega like I said its a lose/lose at least this way everyone starts the expansion on the same foot
[3:02:24] shinta__: Can you do torghast multiple times to get knowledge?

[3:30:11] Triknives: Portland does a lot of dumb stuff.
[3:30:26] h_u_r_k_: @Shakzulah CouldYouNot
[3:30:29] Hank_ish: He’s Quietly successfully Kobe
[3:30:31] mavericks312: @therobbomega if dame requests a trade is the only way and at that only a certain amount of teams have enough to get him
[3:30:34] therobbomega: Portland just held onto CJ / Dame too long, should have moved CJ years ago IMO
[3:30:37] Shakzulah: you need to grind rep still, man
[3:30:38] gfield2k: Do the chest in the new zone reset with reset ?

[3:33:51] therobbomega: a lot
[3:33:52] Shakzulah: im drinking the weed

[3:34:08] mavericks312: yea and maybe a couple swaps
[3:34:18] Kisswani: groceries hill is my favourite point guard Kappa
[3:34:36] therobbomega: I mean, Embiid and Lillard would be a crazy pair
[3:34:38] Shakzulah: Ralnundrinking that loco stuff
[3:34:42] mavericks312: Philly and even maiami with Nunn herro and a couple others are really the only teams who could pull it off
[3:34:51] therobbomega: is a lot to give up, and Simmons is kind of being sold low
[3:35:32] mavericks312: but if Simmons actually fixes his shot you could still offer thybulle, Maxey, and shake Milton with a bunch of picks as well
