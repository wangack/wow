[0:48:41] ponkberry: Cheer500 The game just breeds negativity. Even my all time favorite PUBG streamer chocotaco isn't immune. I was watching him play the other day and he jumped out of a car and potatoed about 10 rounds at a guy then blamed it on a "getting-out-of-car-ADS-bug that's been in the game 6 years" that we all know is not real, lol. The game was frustrating enough when 3 million newbies played, but now that it's just the sweatlords left, it's even more frustrating and it affects everyone.
