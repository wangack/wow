[1:23:49] Weelad_x: :/
[1:23:53] DocsMistake: it was super cool for the first week but then they nerfed the parts that people thought were fun about it

[1:24:35] dutchie76: those Chains too
[1:24:39] Catspaw66: so for a torghast noob. is it layer 8 of the normal floors that can award a mount or is that layer 8 of twisting corriders ?
[1:24:52] dutchie76: 144 floors LUL
[1:24:58] Molvonos: @Catspaw66 Layer 8
[1:25:07] Molvonos: 18 Floors per layer.

[1:25:24] TheEnstraynomic: was how torghast turned out just as bad as how badly blizzard flubbed wc3 reforged?

[2:47:34] ThiCCboiyG: papa_del_mar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! hammerdoggin!
[2:47:39] zilmerpro: you stopped retail?
[2:48:28] Dayszen: hows your new guild doing
[2:48:43] batsun1corn: farming anima for all the collectables is driving me crazy tbh
[2:49:20] Felrane: but what about the million anima you need for mogs and upgrades to base?!
[2:50:00] einself111: i played a lot of valheim since i unsubbed i had so much fun. @Towelliee
[2:50:08] acee626: big facts
[2:50:15] batsun1corn: but you are gonna be farming them for years LUL
[2:50:42] Dayszen: thing is i like the campaign colors better anyways lol
[2:51:37] Jesperoni: dang did i miss out on not raiding in wod?
[2:51:37] rocthenite: but bfa bad becuase bald man told me so
[2:51:59] Moiste: honestly i like the idea of being "done" with a patch rather than grinding nonstop for AP
[2:52:03] batsun1corn: I mean they gotta do something, as a warrior that farms transmog and collectables its so bad to farm millions of anima for every type of weapon they sell, and there are 4 covenants LUL
[2:52:45] BlueBeast33: It's better to have various grinds to do throughout the game instead of just one endless grind
[2:52:58] BlueBeast33: TBC is like that
[2:53:18] Jesperoni: i like having alts, being "done" on certain characters feels nice
[2:53:36] rocthenite: oh oh...you are not suggesting tf need to come back?
[2:53:39] ohfoeshow: i prefer it now cuz artificial grinds are artificial
[2:54:09] rocthenite: @ohfoeshow the game is dying becuase of asmongold and rich camball
[2:54:25] acee626: Honestly borrowed power fucked the game, it was so much better without it

[2:54:27] TheEnstraynomic: would adding corruption back to SL be what you want?
[2:54:40] cbrother: the power increase is every patch. Isn't it nice to be *done* so you can do shit like level in classic instead?
[2:54:43] chrslp: Those healing potions are lifesavers as a druid. Buy you enough time to pop off a healing wave
[2:55:04] secondarych: Retail FeelsBadMan
[2:55:08] KaisenSiru: It's fine.
[2:55:22] rocthenite: bfa was good, asmongold wanted moneyu

[2:57:21] chrslp: LUL
[2:57:25] Vanhoek: lol
[2:57:30] Vanhoek: TBC will be before 9.1
[2:57:32] jason_tacey: LUL an Ony steamer
[2:57:53] chrslp: I think theyre gonna rush BC to take the focus off of 9.1 LUL
[2:58:06] batsun1corn: Ye its so weird how dogs sleep upwards in bed
[2:58:19] anacronz: i play retail again if the add soloque for pvp
[2:58:33] BlueBeast33: I don't think TBC will be first because that would put 9.1 in like August...that would be really bad
[2:58:59] chrslp: Same cost 1/3 the content Kappa
[2:59:16] NetherRegion: the build up
[2:59:23] batsun1corn: new raid, new season, idk, seems not so promising tbh FeelsBadMan
[2:59:45] SlowpokeIsAGamer: If we get 9.1 PTR this month, it'll be first. If we don't see 9.1 PTR until April, BC's coming first.
[2:59:55] anacronz: ok shadowlands fails also.. whats next expansion?
[3:00:03] MonstaMk8: I'd prefer to have a big patch then a rushed big buggy patch tbh.
[3:00:08] Maego1: Im kinda disappointed that new season mounts are just recolors :( i mean they are nice but you know
[3:00:21] SlowpokeIsAGamer: @anacronz Also a failure.
[3:00:50] Domini1001: @Towelliee  Towel what about your tbc guild?  application closed?

[4:06:02] tocu: I do think we see a continued up tick in single household size dev teams games. Valheim had 5 people, that size does a good job avoiding covid issues.
[4:06:19] dalvynthedrunk: For me there aint shit till August aside from Biomutant and ESO expansion
[4:06:55] LegoCoin: Oh yeah ESO too but I am getting board of its textures and graphics
[4:07:38] LegoCoin: yeah I have my PS5 and my 4k TV but seems wasnt expecting covid so dead on new games for 4k
[4:07:40] tocu: if i can get a ps5 rachet and clank definitly on my list the last one was fantastic
[4:07:40] Dalsonson: To be honest, I feel like Outtiders still have a Borderlands 3 problem with it. Good campaign, horrendous end game, no depth to it. Just another shotty FPS Looter Shooter that tried to dethrone Destiny 2
[4:07:44] LegoCoin: hopefully will see more 2022
[4:08:46] dalvynthedrunk: There are still some good games coming out this year but I have specific tastes for a lot of games
[4:08:48] Keyastaron_: i hope everything comes back i hate this covid stuff
[4:08:59] LegoCoin: I bet they try to save money and just do Blizzcon online
[4:09:13] Keyastaron_: you really think the shots will work?
[4:09:20] tocu: the plan is everyone in the US who wants a shot will have it by may 1st
[4:09:26] zodd_amhai: have u heard the legendary marvin hangler passed away
[4:09:29] shortyforthewin: all need too get the  shoot for covid and then it hopefully  calm down abit
[4:09:36] ktownchef: me too but that's because i'm a front line worker. otherwise i'd have to wait a few more months. But that's here in Canada.
[4:09:44] zodd_amhai: hagler*
[4:09:44] g0ran0: !tbc
[4:09:50] Grawh1: You in Cali....you paid for that shot and you sacrificed you soul to get it
[4:10:12] raymond3195: cc ant see new xpas till 2023
[4:10:22] Dalsonson: What good would a BlizzConline do then if it’s front to back prep for an in person BlizzCon?
[4:10:36] Grawh1: IN Alaska they are giving 16 year olds the shots already
[4:10:38] shortyforthewin: all need too get it then we stop it  if a mayor group dont get it it will mutate for ever
[4:11:02] ktownchef: Oh ya I still wear my mask and everything. I didn't burn all my ppe just because i'm getting the vaccine soon
[4:11:32] Infinitepeeep: i work at a grocery store, they paid me to get the shot
[4:11:41] LegoCoin: well I am having party on July 4th with everyone LOL

[4:12:39] Grawh1: it is crazy cuz in other countries people wore masks when they where sick A long time before this covid crap
[4:12:41] Dalsonson: 350 7 days average? THAT’S INSANE
[4:12:44] ktownchef: It would be nice to be able to travel back to the US again. I usually visit 3-4 times a year. Once Vegas and then sports events.

[4:13:14] LegoCoin: I think we had 2 in my county

[4:15:28] AirmVn: yes please give me 3 months between
[4:15:34] ktownchef: prepatch is may
[4:15:50] Saephon: Shit, yeah. shadowlands launch feels forever ago, 9.1 seems real late
[4:15:54] Lillpapps: if later 9.1 means shorter draught at the end of the expansion that's fine by me

[4:16:17] Dogewiz: yeah if pre patch is may 18 if it is then we would be looking at july but the may 18th needs to be an actual pre patch date

[4:18:20] dalvynthedrunk: August for 9.1, absolutely insane, almost  a year for a .1 patch, idk seems ridiculous
[4:18:25] ktownchef: red basilisks

[4:19:50] dalvynthedrunk: I get Covid delaying content but a patch that is usually 3 months after launch moved to 9 months
[4:19:52] XshadowturkeyX: if you belive aug+ for 9.1 then i deff 100% dont belive tbc in june .. so soon after its announced .. bs
[4:20:11] ktownchef: ya for sure the collaboration is way harder. You just can't walk over to your boss and be like do you like this or what do you think of this
[4:20:11] Infinitepeeep: not in the caver
[4:20:12] Grawh1: Covid is Bullshit...it was a power grab by republicans to make you sheep stay at home
[4:20:18] Infinitepeeep: its to the right of this area
[4:20:27] Dogewiz: well the difference with classic and tbc is that tbc is just and expac it would be easier to port over taking less time
[4:20:36] Lockrocker: lol @Grawh1
[4:20:36] shrektard69: hi everyone

[4:22:30] Colt_Engineer: teams ui is garbage

[4:25:55] Dogewiz: Lets say the beta/alpha start this month were looking at a 2month period and stress testing looking at a july release

[4:26:05] Dogewiz: they said 9.1 will hit ptr shortly after 9.5 goes live
[4:26:15] Dogewiz: so 9.1 ptr is prob next month
[4:26:40] Aktz_: tbc beta this week?
[4:26:42] Dogewiz: so a summer release for 9.1 maybe late july to early august at earliest
[4:27:01] Dogewiz: just a theory if beta or alpha go live this month
[4:27:38] Clicklesly: It would be pretty weird if they don't time TBC during a downtime, just due to sub influx ^^
[4:28:00] Felrane: I hope we get prepatch but it lasts 2-3 months before BC
[4:28:10] Lillpapps: tbc prepatch may 18th, 9.1 june and tbc release in july or august is my guess
[4:28:12] Dogewiz: yeah releasing tbc so retail has more time to develop would be smart

[4:28:53] BlueBeast33: yeah I can see TBC prepatch lasting longer than normal since people have to level and even with nerfed exp it's gonna take a while
[4:28:57] dalvynthedrunk: I guess they are hoping that TBC would offset any large drop in subs from a large shadowlands drought
[4:29:02] ahies28: they gave us nothing for 9.1
[4:29:31] Dogewiz: they said ptr would hit shortly after 9.0.5
[4:29:33] Felrane: some concept art
[4:29:37] Dogewiz: right or am i crazy
[4:29:38] dalvynthedrunk: Raid, dungeon, zone expansion
[4:29:42] LegoCoin: its ok I am still only at 27 % in all the things LUL
[4:29:48] ktownchef: you didn't even have the classic flyby through the raid and mega dungeon.
[4:30:09] dalvynthedrunk: 9.1 is a pretty big patch for a .1 for sure, raid, dungeon, zone, but being so far away is the problem, its coming out closer to when 9.2 would be tested
[4:30:11] Zomble85: hey @Towelliee any idea what the shadowlands beta on bliz launcher is about?
[4:30:15] BartonLua: missing the good legion days

[4:31:28] shortyforthewin: ok
[4:31:29] BlueBeast33: I'm skeptical on the content tbh, it really depends on what Korthia is and what changes Torghast will get
[4:31:31] ktownchef: probably why preach's RBG month has turned into 6 weeks lol
[4:32:23] Avinar: gives me time to level alts in classic got tbc I guess. I'm indecisive as is. debating on shaman and boomkin to do something new
[4:32:30] dalvynthedrunk: Dang, yeah so they def are just hoping TBC will cancel out any shadowlands drought because a lot of people would unsub with a wait that long
[4:32:58] jeziorek: yeah sure Kappa
[4:33:02] sticksaredrifting: with how shadowlands has been so far. im not too excited for next patch
[4:33:07] dalvynthedrunk: 9.1 is the size of a .2 patch, but the problem is there is nothing in between
[4:33:07] Dogewiz: I mean its smart to schedule tbc classic around retail droughts
[4:33:08] Val3rion: when do you think 9.1 will hit?
[4:33:09] BartonLua: doesnt the new ffxiv expansion come out around summer as well tho?
[4:33:18] ktownchef: You could have just stopped at I get to fight Sylvannas

[4:33:22] BlueBeast33: Instanced content sure, but WoW is really lacking in good world content
[4:33:43] Avinar: xiv xpac won't be til fall which it may not be til Oct due to it all being super delayed from covid and their patches
[4:33:47] dalvynthedrunk: Dead, lol very dead
[4:33:48] DreavT2K: feck new patch, we need new expac Kappa
[4:33:58] DreavT2K: every year new expac
[4:34:01] rocthenite: even FFXIV new expanson got delayed
[4:34:10] Felrane: we also had malagos and sarth with naxx so it wasn't to bad
[4:34:15] zodd_amhai: @rocthenite FF14 content cycle is always slow and few
[4:34:17] XshadowturkeyX: uhhhhh 6.2?
[4:34:21] shortyforthewin: haha
[4:34:25] ktownchef: hopefully this raid is as good as Ulduar was
[4:34:26] Lockrocker: I bet Blizzard has switched all resources to Diablo Immortal... that game is long over due for all the masses that are hyped for the best mobile game ever made
[4:34:32] dalvynthedrunk: Delayed 9.1 to August to cancel New World hype smdh
[4:34:46] StateFarm206: im actually gonna level for the 1st time in ff14
[4:35:00] Spongeyguy: 9.0 was good enough to placate it
[4:35:02] Alepouditsa: @BlueBeast33 yea i got bored for me dungions and raids are for ppl with a lot of time and there is nothing to do for me.keep in mind i have lonly like a year sins i start playing
[4:35:04] Virus2508: man i think its time to stop with the covid excuses, we had 1 year to adapt to that shit now...
[4:35:06] Avinar: xiv xpac was supposed to be around July/august, we are already behind on the patches for it. so not expecting EW til maybe even November could be late Oct
[4:35:06] dalvynthedrunk: Well I am glad I am back in gw2 then, I like Shadowlands but not enough to play till August
[4:35:23] Grawh1: Yea cuz WoWhead is always right

[4:35:58] Avinar: can give me a sub for both? Kappa
[4:36:01] ZorGhost_: would you have preferred a raid like trial of valor for shadowlands between the time you wait for a big patch @Towelliee
[4:36:16] Felrane: come on chromatic sword!
[4:36:20] HindenbergZA: drops chromatic sword
[4:36:25] dalvynthedrunk: I think a 1-3 boss raid with some new light content is kind of needed
[4:36:36] Grawh1: It is semi factual...they Look back but the can't perdict the  future
[4:36:46] dalvynthedrunk: Damn will this expansion last longer than any previous one
[4:36:55] Avinar: new world hype with ashes alpha Kappa
[4:36:57] jeziorek: give us stable tbc and we good
[4:37:04] Spongeyguy: theres no chance they pull another wod
[4:37:05] BartonLua: do you think they may just pull a wod if schedule is this terrible?
[4:37:23] Hjolt: i mean, if there's ever a chance for low-patch count its during a pandemic
[4:37:24] DreavT2K: we need 9.20
[4:37:27] ktownchef: Especially if blizzard keeps with its 2-2.5 years between xpacs
[4:37:28] dalvynthedrunk: I still think we will get a mini raid dealing with the drust or soemthing, after 9.1
[4:37:28] Felrane: I hope they dont do a WoD and just abandon the expo
[4:37:57] dalvynthedrunk: dang these delays can ruin what would have been one of the better expansions imo
[4:38:07] BartonLua: jaina? LUL
[4:38:07] Lockrocker: Jaina?

[4:38:34] PadidinJones: @Towelliee knows something. Shes really a dreadlord isnt she
[4:38:36] Felrane: Jaina really is a dreadlord working with the Jailer
[4:38:36] BartonLua: yeah sylvanas being raid boss for 9.1 caught everyone by surprise I think
[4:38:40] volkreig: @Towelliee you're right considering they were asking for suggestions as to where to take conduits and soulbinds
[4:38:40] snoo_32: clip it and ship it towellie xD
[4:38:40] miroc228: did you sire or still prog on him?
[4:38:44] Atrociouz: we aint killing sylvanas
[4:38:46] Avinar: yeah xiv had 8 months of a drought, then another 8 months or so. also they canceled their ultimate raid, so I expect WoW to be dealing with the same shit
[4:38:53] Atrociouz: she will survive somehow
[4:39:08] Lockrocker: confirmed, Jaina is disguised as Sylvanas... she has been doing all these shitbag things to make the Horde look bad
[4:39:21] Grawh1: OK I am tired of your negative chat..I am gonna go watch someone playing LoL

[5:28:16] mebobbumman: I was never because of Farmers, it was an energy saving tactic for the rest of the world. Farmers get up with the sun
[5:28:30] TweakT: places with low sunlight during winter also try to catch as much sunlight as possible and dst helps with that
[5:28:31] PrisheBurningBlade: @Dubstepwubs im in AZ we dont, same time all year, but no one uses AZ time for anything... so it effects us just as much... got remeber when EST is +2 or +3 etc

[5:45:41] RodneyIsPro: i ran +12s for 3 days to get my gear and it was more than enough once i actually got the gear
[5:45:47] KaisenSiru: Sounds like Siege to me.
[5:45:59] mwchaos: id love to work on my other toons but after helping guildies get their 210 IQD to level up im like fuck that lol
[5:46:13] Keyastaron_: whats what i call i big rip if you didnt get anything

[5:47:46] Lazugo: XD
[5:48:01] mwchaos: YUUUUP
[5:48:14] TheGaoSora: Because this game is pvp oriented in its core
[5:48:23] Clicklesly: And then you don't even need Conquest to upgrade it ^^
[5:48:23] lOpzEh: Morning @Towelliee Hope you're having a good stream so far!
[5:48:26] jalanea: no its not xD
[5:48:33] mwchaos: the implementation of valor is pretty poor. Good idea and we had to have something, but this implementation is kinda dumb
[5:48:40] TweakT: pvp’ers are crybabies, pve’ers are the real Chads
[5:48:46] DennisTried: i'd like to take this moment to give a shoutout to water. thanks for keeping us hydrated, fam. shoutsout h2o.
[5:48:53] mwchaos: The other problem is why cant we do +20s on everything and get 226 upgrades for valor
[5:48:58] MrGattz: if only more gear dropped..
[5:49:12] Julian_______: still worth to play classic and level up for TBC? or am i too late to the party?

[5:49:32] Avinar: they just actively want to make shit annoying
[5:49:51] mwchaos: cause if we could shoot for 226 upgrades on pve gear that would be different too.
[5:49:52] Imolate_: @Julian_______ Ofc not too late. Prepatch isnt even out yet
[5:49:53] RodneyIsPro: i thought i was gonna come in on Tuesday and get all my gear and upgrade it same day, and i quickly learned that is not the case
[5:50:05] raymond3195: in cata you could buy gear
[5:50:14] MrGattz: @Avinar i mean there is a reason we have the whole "fun detected" thing. blizzard doesnt allow fun
[5:50:20] stjon13: they really need to do the" pvp gear scales up in arena's bg's etc so ppl on either side don't feel forced to do what they don't like
[5:50:22] TheGaoSora: ⚒️
[5:50:28] Julian_______: @imolate_ last time i played the EU servers were dead for low leveled players, especially since everyone is boosting now :(

[5:51:17] Imolate_: @Julian_______ Yeah I feel you. Maybe wait til prepatch, probably alot of people is gonna come back and level new characters. Xp is reduced then too :)
[5:51:23] snoo_32: is it true in BC we get a level 58 boost ? i don't even think i will use mine, but that is cool if it's true.
[5:51:41] atngaming: i farmed piretes at the ships forever and did not get it, then went just outside the cave entrence and got it from first drop LOL
[5:51:41] Julian_______: @imolate_ that's awesome, imma wait till then, ty homie
[5:51:51] TweakT: so cool @snoo_32
[5:51:52] Avinar: @mrgattz yeah I mean the fun detected has also been more broadened to random bugs or stuff like ele shaman in beta lol. just a shame they work against it all so often.
[5:51:55] MabGamingTm: omg im so stoked for that
[5:52:05] MabGamingTm: it alone will bring me to tbc
[5:52:05] Osskssa: but is it paid @Towelliee
[5:52:10] jalanea: on beta or on "live"?
[5:52:25] MabGamingTm: when is prepatch?
[5:52:28] TheGaoSora: can't be drenai or Belf
[5:52:28] BlueBeast33: unless you wanna play a draenei or blood elf
[5:52:33] Dubstepwubs: so i can just boost a dranei? POGGERS
[5:52:40] TheLastRace: I have 8 60s one of each class. No need for a boost :)
[5:52:45] Avinar: I'm not sure why people are so salty about that one time boost lately. I could see the issue being tons of boosts but idk about 1 time per account.. I guess bots with multi accounts?
[5:52:51] scassel85: How much do you think it'll cost
[5:52:53] Osskssa: hey they give free boosts sometimes @Towelliee lol
[5:52:54] NickLeonhearth: you said free boost :D
[5:53:01] othraerir: when did the levelling nerfs come in?
[5:53:02] CardinalTX: probably $60 for the boost?
[5:53:02] RodneyIsPro: is activision blizzard?
[5:53:18] TheGaoSora: D:
[5:53:21] MuttonChopins: classic has integrity?
[5:53:24] GazXIII: Integrity? Classic? lul
[5:53:27] TweakT: yea bots are once again gonna rake in money for blizzard from boost
[5:53:31] MrGattz: no no. poeple are mad about the boost because they NEED to be mad at something. if they dont they melt.
[5:53:41] Frank4LuLz: we need duel spec and dk's in TBC
[5:53:46] Avinar: can they blow up tbc classic integrity with dual spec too? or is that too far
[5:53:50] snoo_32: i'll probably boost a rogue, rogue doesn't seem very raid friendly, in TBC and i rather focus on my warrior first.
[5:54:01] GazXIII: Viewers, boost me to lvl 60. I want to feel nostalgic. (Not targeted to you)

[5:54:18] flebbooo: it’s funny how most people complaining about the boost are full geared naxx andies KEKW
[5:54:28] Imolate_: Im only mad about them not putting some kind of gold cap going into tbc. TBC tokens incoming?
[5:54:34] MrGattz: i would argue fresh servers would have more bots
[5:54:37] Avinar: next up, aoe cap on prot paladin for tbc classic. fun detected!
[5:54:49] DocsMistake: bots are more likely to go to fresh servers imo since it allows them to take over markets
[5:54:58] MrGattz: the quicker they can get the bots going the faster they can ruin the economy in they favor
[5:55:03] TweakT: if I was king of blizzard, I would profit from bots theb ban them
[5:55:21] MrGattz: hahah
[5:55:22] TheGaoSora: @Avinar aoe cap only came up once the whole MDI scene became more "serious", so you're good there lol

[5:56:07] snoo_32: i think a boost would make gold meaningless which is kind of a good thing right ?
[5:56:11] MrGattz: i mean it still wouldnt actually help. retail is still packed with bots

[5:59:13] Imolate_: No classic, some pickpocket bot or some shit
[5:59:20] sticksaredrifting: classic the rogues go into dungeons and pickpocket for hours on end

[5:59:39] sticksaredrifting: super low chance
[5:59:45] TheGaoSora: smells like classic
[6:00:02] snoo_32: i think blizzard selling gold is a decent way to cut into sellers. If i want gold i trust blizzard of course and nothing else.
[6:00:13] sticksaredrifting: time change kekw
[6:00:14] Avinar: we heard you hate farming 25/25 for enemies, so instead this quest has a 5% drop rate
[6:00:15] Clicklesly: Don't think you're really supposed to farm this quest, just do it alongside all the other pirate stuff ^^

[6:01:24] Avinar: I'm just glad they said fuck your drums
[6:01:27] TheGaoSora: @Towelliee will you keep a copy of your char on TBC if/when WotlK comes out?
[6:01:34] wafflez16: feral does pretty good dmg lvling
[6:01:35] TweakT: well yeah, cause private servers actually have a valid reason to deal with bots, blizzard’s motivation isnt the same

[6:03:02] snoo_32: this reminds me of a mobile game i played. They sold resources packs at 16.5 million resources for 5$ in order to compete with sellers. It works pretty good.

[6:04:26] TheGaoSora: pepegal

[6:05:07] MrGattz: i think its a great idea.
[6:05:08] DigitalChill: sounds like a bad movie, Band of Bottters
[6:05:08] Avinar: would be the only pvp that server has
[6:05:12] TheGaoSora: Send some Multiboxers to there as well Kappa
[6:05:20] oakley303: there wont be botters again its not 10 years back

[6:05:43] bakurathewolf: @TheOmniSora KEKW
[6:05:44] PadidinJones: I mean how can you detect them? There is no detection or a report button for bots
[6:06:00] TheGaoSora: "The Towelliee Accord"
[6:06:28] Imolate_: @PadidinJones You click their frame and report for cheating. Works in classic too
[6:06:39] mwchaos: thats what happened in classic lol dire maul farming, SM farming youd get banned and have to put in a ticket
[6:06:41] hamburgertomyhelper: Bots and GDKP will kill Classic TBC if things arent done
[6:06:46] brazkat: farelina had a huge problem with right click reporting though
[6:06:47] dokor: never heard of it, there was some boting and hacking in EQ, but SOE would just ban you if they caught you
[6:06:55] Vance: Man, the old cat form for Tauren Druid looks so much better than the one in retail from a general model, feels so much more badass.
[6:07:06] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee you can implement a step tracker, if a character takes the same route 10 times in a row, step-by-step without any mistakes, it's not a human being
[6:07:07] mwchaos: or actually when we were trying ot get the gates open we had a bunch of people on our server get banned for farming cloth LMAO
[6:07:09] snoo_32: in diablo 2 classic battlenet, blizzard banned all ip traffic from asia and gave them their own seperate server. I don't see why they don't do that with other games.
[6:07:21] oakley303: and what if your a legit player farming there wil you get banned then aswel?
[6:07:23] emperormingg: introduce a captcha everytime you pick up a black lotus LUL
