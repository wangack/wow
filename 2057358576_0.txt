[4:31:26] Dritzzts: is there an update to @eZ_BFT grind?
[4:31:27] waluBub: to be fair it is outlaw/rsham/caster mirror
[4:31:29] Dritzzts: @eZ_BFT hell yea
[4:31:39] eZ_BFT: @Dritzzts we're getting better and absolutely plummeting in rating lmao

[4:33:07] Dritzzts: @eZ_BFT did u set up focus macros and shit
[4:33:09] moistydank: i mean if you have a comp that can root and CC their damage WW is useless right
[4:33:13] moistydank: then dh is the same
[4:33:15] iTzCompadre: DH borderline has as much cc as a rogue...
[4:33:16] casper24411442: carry me
[4:33:17] moistydank: outlaw just controls everything
[4:33:18] ochamp25: you are asking a bunch of 1400 chads, of course DH is worse cause the outlaw rogues suck at this rating
[4:33:30] Vendrek: WW has great damage but limited CC and Defensives in comparison to Outlaw and DH
[4:33:30] moistydank: i mean you are right the damage is crazy
[4:33:30] smergeI: saturday cup 2 finals again?

[4:36:39] sage_yu: oh i hear peak
[4:36:43] sage_yu: i hear peak
[4:37:29] nubcake_: I feel like a possible fix for DH is to slightly increase their cool downs globally, that way they aren‚Äôt constant pressure + one shot ability and have to coordinate burst windows
[4:37:30] Dritzzts: honestly i would be down to watch pika play like overwatch or a FPS
