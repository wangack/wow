[4:28:31] AyoGavino: I just wish we would get a little bit more anima if we don't get gear. Working hard in a M+ just to get 35 anima is demoralizing
[4:28:32] Jarlan23: ill take what it is now vs what we had in bfa everytime
[4:28:34] Puns_Blazing: That's why they reduced drop rates - they want overall gearing process to be the same as before on average
[4:28:42] Steadmoh190: isnt that what players been asking for tho, making gear more valuable by having them harder to get

[4:28:48] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: There's recipes behind rep
[4:28:53] kampfzwergratte: only venari for sockets
[4:29:08] pereadin: The only rep thats "important" is Venari and even that is capped daily with Eye of the Jailer
[4:29:11] Ryok: @AyoGavino agree... hell i'd even be fine if they'd just give us an augment rune or two if we don't get loot D:
[4:29:15] Jarlan23: thats how it should be. rep should be an optional fun thing to do in ur off time
[4:29:19] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Wild Hunt revered gets cauldrons. Harvesters rep for feasts.
[4:29:19] Dhagoro: Hey @Towelliee What was the name of the guy you let stream in your stream once? He was black-skin (no offense intendend), pretty chill vibes and playing warrior i think
[4:29:27] Jarlan23: Less chores = good thing
[4:29:30] Dantium: personally, I'm logging in every day now because the game is actually fun again
[4:29:35] Vigi9413: I don't think people will quit
[4:29:37] TheVaracob: achievable grinds are ok. i see a bar i grind until its full. full clear raid and do 10 mythics for 1 piece of gear isnt sustainable. gonna see alot of casuals (no flame) get tired of having to wait 2 months to do content they see people doingtoday
[4:29:40] Snuupies: are they still gonna use rep for pathfinder?
[4:29:40] bakkich: Smart if you ask me
[4:29:43] Vigi9413: endless grind vs maybe get loot
[4:29:46] Dantium: I can choose to do whatever I want to do rather than feeling bad for not farming out AP
[4:29:48] Vigi9413: i'll take maybe get loot
[4:29:59] branTVx: what you guys are actually complaining that the grind of the game is loot? come on
[4:30:21] Jarlan23: more people are playing alts and thats healthy for the game
[4:30:28] Mangelstein: obviously an mmo will be a grind, some way or another.
[4:30:29] calvofurioso: why is scarce loot bad again?
[4:30:36] Apologisee: but why let a drop happen in the first palce? big brain it again create correct content for what you have now
[4:30:50] JDsWorld: like the USA
[4:30:52] PadidinJones: I kinda like the current system but dislike the current loot situation
[4:31:18] MotleyGrue: Isnt that good design though? Seems like everyone gets to grind their "bracket"
[4:31:42] esrou: As a more casual raider with guild being 8/10 my guild and I are enjoying taking our time
[4:31:48] andycoin99: I think the dungeons are fun af in this expansion
[4:31:52] TheVaracob: just wait until they add teir sets and it takes months to complete them. thats when youre gonna see ppl rage
[4:31:55] calvofurioso: you can still grind loot in m+, just really grindy and probably requires a tight group of people to share.
[4:31:56] jakobsurfs: im pretty happy for the content i do (lower keys >5) but i have buddies who used to do higher content all pissed off
[4:31:59] AetherMana: isnt that what people wanted? To freak out when they got their look to drop, and not worry about essences
[4:32:00] Ryok: i'd be fine with this system if there was some kind of pitty system, i went like 7 M+ in a row and the only loot i got was a god damn pet >.>
[4:32:02] Jarlan23: the dungeons are fun but the affixes arent
[4:32:07] saltyastheseas: i dont like all the time gated stuff this xpac
[4:32:11] Jarlan23: blizzy trying to make me level a ranged or something
[4:32:16] TheUnknowing: @MotleyGrue Yes and no maybe? i'm not sure, coming off the last two expansions especially i feel like people just arent reacting to it well
[4:32:18] Jarlan23: all these bs melee affixes
[4:32:43] R4d1o4ct1v3_: They have to give us something for running M+ and raids tho. Can't just go through them without getting anything. Even just cosmetics would be better than nothing.
[4:32:50] calvofurioso: I like the progression tbh.
[4:32:53] Darkmattermaster08: brewmaster?
[4:32:56] Ryok: i did 39 M+ in the 2 weeks it's available and i still miss gear in 2 slots D:
[4:33:02] calvofurioso: wellfare loot is bad imo
[4:33:05] TheUnknowing: I feel like long time players definitely adjust to all of this better but who knows, ive played since tbc and im completely fine with this system
[4:33:07] davidnewski: I don't mind the progression either, it's an MMO after all
[4:33:10] branTVx: @R4d1o4ct1v3_ you have keystone master for m+
[4:33:18] Jarlan23: i honestly really like it. i like playing alts a lot.
[4:33:21] branTVx: which is a sick elemental mount
[4:33:24] MotleyGrue: @TheUnknowing Yeah took me a while to get used to it. I had 13 runs with no items last week. Kinda felt sucky? Im 198ilvl now though and feeling better about loot.
[4:33:30] Bayne77: satisfy me blizzard! Kappa
[4:33:37] inkstainedadventure: I consider myself a casual player and I'm getting bored far faster than I did even in BfA
[4:33:39] Jarlan23: less chores and bullshit i gotta do the happier ill be
[4:33:59] warrenny: Its frustrating at times but not that bsf
[4:34:15] EyeannP: having second thoughts on coming back now tbh. Come back no guild no direction. Gonna suck

[4:34:31] Apologisee: Its tough for casuals i think, people may only get 10 hours a week to play and get 1-3 items a week through rng
[4:34:35] TheUnknowing: @MotleyGrue It definitely does feel sucky coming off the last few expansions but ive adjusted to it myself, i'm around 195 on my main
[4:34:36] br0fest0r: just farm mythic BoEs. more loot than bosses
[4:34:42] TheVaracob: the real kick in the balls is i killed 15 raid bosses this week and got a bag i could buy for 1400g
[4:34:54] Thunderbrew: As long as we can still have fun
[4:35:25] TheUnknowing: Right? it sucks that the bag is considered a normal loot drop @TheVaracob
[4:35:32] Daveybutter: @towelliee thoughts on the Riot Games MMO announcement?
[4:35:49] VIRUSplw: at least be 34slotter
[4:35:59] torvoltas: the bag actualy sims +1 dps LUL
[4:36:02] starless0ne: only way a bag counts as loot is if it has more slots than available to crafters
[4:36:11] TheUnknowing: Alright bois, we are all leaving for the riot mmo Kappa
[4:36:24] Ryok: that game's gonna come out in like 5 years zhealHaha
[4:36:29] VIRUSplw: lets see it in 10years
[4:36:38] Bayne77: I hear its going to kill wow Kappa
[4:36:40] TheVaracob: soon (tm)
[4:37:33] TheUnknowing: I'll get excited when I play it and if its good, I cant hype myself up any more
[4:37:35] tahkken: remember when Rift was supposed to be the WoW killer? kek pepridge farm remembers
[4:37:41] maddogbg27: @Towelliee What about Ashes of Creation that looks very promising
[4:38:00] NAPK1NS: I remember when warhammer was going to be a wow killer. those were pre twitch days lol
[4:38:09] luscif: Going to play DH later, Towelliee?

[4:38:30] maddogbg27: @Towelliee Damn really? I was kinda hoping it would be good and put the hurt on WoW so they get their shit together
[4:39:00] cygnus888: wildstar was a good mmo

[4:41:48] andycoin99: Oh yeah

[4:47:04] pereadin: @SorionZ enlisted is pretty eh the value comes with all the free stuff they give us. Officers can make bank on top of those things

[4:48:36] JoeHeff: @VIRUSplw They give you a housing allowance, the amount depends on the area you are stationed

[4:49:45] JoeHeff: @pereadin That depends on the rank and branch
[4:49:45] SorionTheGinger: @pereadin ah well - military has some downsides to it so gotta compensate somehow
[4:49:54] MJadeS99: @towelliee just had our living room redone, nothing more satisfying
[4:50:00] cheersfordoobies: somthing always comes up that takes time basically
[4:50:08] pereadin: I did 5 years in the Marine Corps so that's based on my experience in the Corps @JoeHeff
[4:50:41] JoeHeff: <- 18 and counting in AF.
[4:50:46] pereadin: I agree gotta get rid of the carpet
[4:50:49] Apologisee: starts to roll up from the wgheels
[4:50:51] cheersfordoobies: oh flooring can be done in a few days

[4:51:54] starless0ne: unless I just know backwards people, everyone w/ hardwood ends up w/ giant rugs on the ground --- so why not just have carpet?
[4:51:55] Ryok: god i wish my place had carpet D: i miss it so much
[4:51:58] VIRUSplw: so hard to clean up
[4:52:04] inkstainedadventure: Hard wood floors are the only way to live.
[4:52:05] tedol: I don't know, carpet on the wall looks good
[4:52:07] cheersfordoobies: just lots of sweeping and dusting with hardwood floors
[4:52:28] BoezIRL: morning people towHAMUP
[4:52:42] cheersfordoobies: you can get your floor relaminated for cheap, carpets are just a money dumper
[4:52:43] Pallananana: Just get a big boi roomba FeelsGoodMan
[4:52:46] FannyPackGirl: but carpets are so soft and warm
[4:53:11] VIRUSplw: carpet might be ok in bedroom ;P
[4:53:17] Slitze: that's because everyone is moving from LA to corona and towards moreno valley because it's affordable
[4:53:21] tedol: roombas are very good
[4:53:32] whiptail: I love mine
[4:53:33] Pallananana: That was few years ago mby, now they get the job done for sure
