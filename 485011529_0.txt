[0:04:58] rabmak1: I have no motivation to play arenas on the live game because I started season 3 late. Most of my competition has 440+ iLevel, 65+ necks, etc. and I have 425 iLevel, which is roughly a 20% dmg/hp diff = you cannot win at the highest ratings, very discouraging.

[0:06:18] rabmak1: @3ikooc that was true at the start of the expansion but that has been basically entirely removed, if there is any left it's very minimal, your ilevel is basically equal to your outside ilevel now.
