[0:30:47] RedVisionary: @jakenbakeLIVE You need to fix your render resolution. Your render res is low which makes your game have the slight burry look and also (at least for a lot of people) makes their FPS lower as well. It should match your monitor resolution so everything looks better.
[0:30:50] gangsta0095: damn people dont miss
