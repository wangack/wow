[0:25:45] trentbail23: @dilly_wow ya so lets not make it worse
[0:25:45] mzlvyy: oh
[0:25:47] dilly_wow: Well it's not even that it's competitive
[0:25:50] Cezoness: the "this guy is fucked, oh no im dead" is too real :D
[0:25:50] eyesoftheserpent: @pikabooirl hey pika my future guild mate
[0:25:50] Relyst: its still extremelycompetitive KEKW
[0:25:54] dilly_wow: I think they'd just need to rework the key system for it to work like that
[0:25:55] ashraf_ma: A Looot of people are playing M+ it's kind of carrying wow right now so maybe it's a good thing
[0:25:58] Relyst: only 0.1% of players get the title, that shit is hard
[0:25:59] Darkminst: @Rufsepus exactly what i was thikin
[0:26:01] ogbullieboy: re que it
[0:26:11] dilly_wow: Because the key you even want is rng for example
[0:26:12] Plackoz: @matt_caste who tf eats pork in 2024 lmfao
[0:26:14] DankiestGoose: DankiestGoose subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:26:18] zorpiana: oh no commercial break
[0:26:18] exies_87: @dilly_wow heard pika
[0:26:20] zorpiana: lol
[0:26:33] dilly_wow: And like the difference in key level for push weeks and non push weeks is actually pretty insane
[0:26:33] nikthevoker: io score is GOD
[0:26:38] Skillcap: i completely gave up all kinds of pve like month 2 ago, switched to pvp, i feel alive babyyy
[0:26:39] aarseths: Yea it sounds logical in theory, but people cant handle loosing anything anymore man. Freakout if they dont get everything handed xd
[0:26:46] Jervun: im 3150io
[0:26:46] mzlvyy: some1 knows the song

[0:26:52] drfeltgood: I'm learning Adobe Suite right now... bro I am too god damn old for this shit. I have to pause ever new instruction and try to fond what the dude just said on my screen.
[0:26:54] nikthevoker: they only look at IO score and meta class
[0:27:00] moistydank: easy affixes worth shit ones
[0:27:02] valandurrr: pug m+ is already the most toxic aspect of wow by a long shot
[0:27:02] dilly_wow: It's just because some affixes are so terrible to deal with
[0:27:03] valandurrr: no reason to add to it
[0:27:03] nikthevoker: and they have no clue what the IO score meaans LUL
[0:27:06] SoulLessDestroy: @pikabooirl how did you get that mount
[0:27:06] shtain3r: Affixes
[0:27:06] trentbail23: its because of the affixes
[0:27:09] Darkminst: just means what weeks are easy and what weeks are aids
[0:27:10] moistydank: and its so tuned down from season 1 its insane
[0:27:15] dilly_wow: Unironically push weeks are basicaly when the affixes are not a thing LUL
[0:27:23] Skillcap: is the Sepsis a no-go 10/10 situation?
[0:27:28] Moonrake: I'll be honest, I don't think you want everyone that plays PvE to play PvP
[0:27:29] moistydank: @dilly_wow right?
[0:27:33] ashraf_ma: push week means the pool is easier
[0:27:40] exies_87: most affixs are shit, but its just like comps some are easier than others
[0:27:41] Relyst: @Pikabooirl pushing io is like getting PBs at the gym, you dont lose anything if you dont PB
[0:27:42] dilly_wow: Yeah I mean it's just cause half the affixes are horribly designed
[0:27:43] nikthevoker: keys are so easy too
[0:27:51] aarseths: I think mythic+ is as good as the format can get rn,
[0:28:08] bsh_itsbigtrustme: song?
[0:28:10] R1_Prototype: I think we do want those scrubs playing. lol
[0:28:11] Darkminst: Hot Take. i liked seasonal affix...besides thunderinfg
[0:28:14] moistydank: lets get baked af and do one lmao
[0:28:16] dilly_wow: I mean the problem with keys though too is every time you enter one there are just 5 morons in your group pug or not
[0:28:19] Infamousslol: @mzlvyy Maduk ft Veela - Ghost
[0:28:19] jsb250: lets do key :)
[0:28:19] Zenfuzz: keys are pointless
