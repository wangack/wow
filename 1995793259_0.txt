[2:20:14] Sollice:  Any jewelcrafters online available on Illidan
[2:20:33] abracka_: voidwalker has always been ass at holding threat
[2:20:43] abracka_: 30
[2:20:54] Nerendis: warlock tanks will just never scale into 60 raids unfortunately
[2:20:54] bob_vance_the_frigid: too bad ull get knocked out of channel spell instantly
[2:20:57] Nerendis: same for shaman
[2:21:03] danoh_64: i have 90's marvel cards that are worthless
[2:21:16] Seerated: Isn't Voidwalker basically the same as in Classic ? It only works good in early levels, very fast declining after to be kinda useless
[2:21:18] danoh_64: nice cards too
[2:21:19] SpilledMelk: Didn't hellfire hurt you in vanilla?
[2:21:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: paladins get salv at 26 i believe so next phase that could help a little bit
[2:21:25] abracka_: @Nerendis they will, same with shamans
[2:21:29] SpilledMelk: Used to use it to kill myself
[2:21:35] PotbellyGoat: the mage healing looks kinda neat
[2:21:48] Nerendis: @abracka_ How

[2:21:59] CeruleanStar: it's the rare trash drops you really want
[2:22:13] extrnl2: @Nerendis because blizzard wants them to. with sod runes etc
[2:22:45] Nerendis: @extrnl2 lol? What? Blizz can want whatever they want. But warrs and bears will generate more threat
[2:22:58] abracka_: @Nerendis runes, new crafted gear, new dungeon revamp into raids
[2:23:15] extrnl2: @Nerendis you're acting like they can't and won't change anything for sod?
[2:23:21] Nerendis: @abracka_ WEll, I wish you luck and god speed
[2:23:26] abracka_: @abracka_ not to mention there was already warlock off tanks in vanilla raids and shamans tanking dungeons in OG
[2:24:11] extrnl2: @abracka_ there were indeed some raids with warlock offtank, including AQ and maybe something in TBC
[2:24:43] abracka_: paladins are fine even now tanking, i did DM last night without any issues. it's just going to be a bonus having access to blessing of sanc at 30 and holy shield if you ignore consecration at 40
[2:24:51] AkuTVgg: I wish retail had more instances of needing a ranged tank like Leo in SCC and one of the adds on Kael in TK

[2:56:29] NickLeonhearth: no longer gonna be exclusive with twitch?
[2:56:32] j_bar111: it combines them
[2:56:50] Seerated: Think you're very good just here. YT seems like f-n legal stuff and ...just crazy
[2:56:51] drunkieduckie: that’s cool
[2:56:52] Sollice: Server Shutdown inc
[2:56:57] ripshawda3rd: they are all partners
[2:57:09] PotbellyGoat: @Sollice towKek

[2:58:15] j_bar111: like chatterino
[2:58:17] Sollice: You cant talk about the chat program
[2:58:17] j_bar111: ?
[2:58:19] Alaquane: serveer shutdown :(
[2:58:20] Mecabeast: Is it something like you have to be live on twitch to be live on other platforms?
[2:58:25] j_bar111: oh really?
[2:58:26] Sollice: They aren't suppose to use it supposedly
[2:58:36] j_bar111: That seems silly lol
[2:58:42] PokerFaceMoose: @Sollice dont talk about fight club
[2:58:56] Sollice: I believe Twitch said if your streaming on Twitch and some other platform, your not allowed to use a chat aggreigator
[2:58:57] j_bar111: KEKW
[2:59:03] ripshawda3rd: lol
[2:59:10] Bennyrahma: I know thats fuckin right lol
[2:59:11] Gingerprimer: Colts have a pretty free schedule theese next few weeks
[2:59:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Kick needs to write that check
[2:59:18] Seerated: No, not silly, just what exclusivity kinda means :)
[2:59:20] BlackFlagOG: How's kick holding up?
[2:59:25] Panadol324: Kick admis watching right now : on the phone GET the Contract READY NOW !!

[3:00:30] Niksen_99: I wonder how long the reset will be
[3:00:32] Sollice: I would still be careful long term investing in Kick. I don't think they are even close to making a profit

[3:01:01] Bennyrahma: and servers were back
[3:01:01] danoh_64: man i was born 40 years too early lol

[3:01:15] jerseyfive: the entire site got like 10k viewers
[3:01:16] ripshawda3rd: lol
[3:01:16] Sollice: Yeah but the difference is thats Microsoft
[3:01:18] Sollice: This is Kick lol
[3:01:20] PokerFaceMoose: kick is making a profit, by getting people hooked on their gambling websites.
[3:01:27] ripshawda3rd: @danoh_64 lolololol
[3:01:33] Nerendis: That's why i have a job
[3:01:41] Bennyrahma: Contracts are binding
[3:01:44] shosindar: hi
[3:01:45] Seerated: Mixer...long time since I heard anything in regards to that name..
[3:01:49] Wulfgrym: kick is advertising for their gambling so its 100% profitable
[3:01:53] Sollice: @Bennyrahma Oh how little you know about contract law
[3:01:54] Niksen_99: Kick prob making profit from xqc and adin ross alone lol
[3:02:00] Sollice: Thats so not true
[3:02:10] Gelendrill: !server
[3:02:10] Moobot: @Gelendrill Towelliee is playing on Wild Growth server for World of Warcaft: Season of Discovery |
[3:02:11] Nerendis: Contracts don't even have to be signed. Y'all would be terrified if you knew the truth rofl
[3:02:21] Sollice: They could. They could tie it up for years to not pay out
[3:02:21] Chimp458: stake has money and kick is an advertising mechanism for them
[3:02:37] PraxicThorn: well it would depend on the contract. could have an out
[3:02:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: DANGER
[3:03:09] raldrik: So what you are saying Kick is not the michael scott paper company even though it seems like they got the idea from the office
[3:03:12] Sollice: Oh you can get paid.....pennies on the dollar
[3:03:14] Nerendis: You are correct @Towelliee because you can sue for failure to complete the contract
[3:03:18] Recording_on_the_grass: used to watch kick everyday for 7 months now back to twitch :)
[3:03:22] extrnl2: as long as there's money behind the company
[3:03:22] PokerFaceMoose: i mean you could run out of money for lawyers before kick does lol
[3:03:25] Alaquane: nah. they already owe more  money than anyone they have to pay out. they'll bankrupt and pay their first debtors first and not pay anyone
[3:03:25] Bennyrahma: At some point both parties would prolly settle to an agreement
[3:03:26] Sollice: When they file for bankrupcty and they have to offer settlements on payouts and debts.
[3:03:28] sandychicken2: it all depends on where the other company is located if not in the USA then USA legal system doesn’t apply
[3:03:55] Seerated: What if they call bankrupt then ? In EU you'd be screwed out of any money
[3:03:57] Niksen_99: They think kick tried to make their website look too much like twitch
[3:03:57] one2gone: the owner of kick is the owner of a online casino thats why
[3:03:58] Sollice: @Alaquane Yep this is very true also. Going bankrupt...Do I pay out AGS or a streamer :P
[3:04:04] Chimp458: kick is run on twitches aws platform amazon makes money either way

[3:04:12] Nerendis: @sandychicken2 This is not correct
[3:04:26] polaropposite76: @Towelliee  what was the site you were using to look at trading card sale prices?>
[3:04:33] luckfore: its based on the leaked twitch source code
[3:04:45] Sollice: If you offer service in the US, then your terms must be accepted by US
[3:05:10] Sollice: They could be based in China, but if they are streaming in US and US has a law...no...whatever on stream, then you can have it
[3:05:13] polaropposite76: nothing specific atm just saw you use it and was wondering what it was
[3:05:23] luckfore: first few weeks were a literal copy of twitch

[3:06:29] Sollice: @PraxicThorn Oh yea that is very true. Which is why I said....if Kick wasn't to fuck people they are going to fuck people. Unless the country is friendly to US lawsuits

[3:11:10] Sollice: @Molvonos I changed the SoD Discord for new people. They have to react with the sword to come in as members and see all the channels. I think before that had to be manually given permissions
[3:11:17] Molvonos: @Sollice Sounds good

[3:20:17] runehako: DoD sounds dope
[3:20:19] Ezekyler: if took years to unlock runes, no one will play it
[3:20:20] extrnl2: btw do we know if they
[3:20:22] Snabido: SoD would've died before all runes gotten discovered CoolCat
[3:20:27] extrnl2: are planning on addind new runes in future phases?
[3:20:34] UltraKSlaya: I hope they add more to the game other than dungeons turned to raids
[3:20:38] ashwing_: Let me level 5 years to 25 LUL
[3:20:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: people can't stand 3 minutes of ads but they want to search for months for runes
[3:20:40] Clicklesly: It's pretty much done in a week, what would you do for months?
[3:20:42] j_bar111: I actually like its only 25, I can get to 25 get done what i want then go back to retail for a bit. The amount of wow content out right now is so nice.
[3:20:45] TexRex_86: SoD is only the very first part, there is still so much more to go until 60. I think pacing is just fine
[3:20:55] runehako: oof lol
[3:20:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[3:21:04] Mckhero: agreed
[3:21:05] MrKhanes: This is just the first runes, more will come with each phase.
[3:21:06] AzedaNA: I'm just curious where they go next. How do you beat this iteration of seasonal content?
[3:21:07] d2darkalliance: @towelliee i actually agree it should take longer. whats point have a Discovery system if its over in a week?
[3:21:08] Velanthos: yeah the fact its gated lets me get my retail keys in lol
[3:21:10] Mckhero: too draining
[3:21:11] Alaquane: After phase 1 ends, can we get classic season of discovery classic #nochange #25capbestcap?

[3:22:02] j_bar111: Just ignore the guides
[3:22:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some of those Classic people  (and former devs) like having things so tough that only a few people can ever do it
[3:22:11] Mckhero: based on what i saw they added the runes and they seem to each inherit class fantasy
[3:22:13] Wulfgrym: tanking runes should be early in the phase to let you gear for it
[3:22:13] morbiddiamond: @j_bar111 True
[3:22:23] morbiddiamond: @HaxzorJimDuggan KEK
[3:22:23] UltraKSlaya: I want more discoveries that aren't necessarily tied to power
[3:22:25] BStabes22: The whole point of SOD is the changes and if it takes months to find them then its just classic again
[3:22:35] runehako: yeah thats was an odd choice to make tank runes late game
[3:22:43] purplegold81: why can’t they make it available for someone to get it solo?

[3:22:55] ambiotic: we put in all this cool shit that people want to do, but nope you cannot do it right away  is not a  good development model
[3:22:59] d2darkalliance: @towelliee blizzard should Also not interfere in the race. if boss to easy/hard let it be. i always hated personally the nerfs blizzard do to raids and content overall. thats why i personally quit raiding
[3:23:21] byrdeen45: they need to bring this to reyail
[3:23:32] byrdeen45: retail
[3:23:36] Nerendis: @d2darkalliance HUH
[3:23:36] king_julian_96: do you know what blizzard will do with BFD when phase 2 of SoD is out
[3:23:39] AzedaNA: I'm enjoying it, but I feel like Blizz is being too heavy handed on rune nerfs. I'm hoping they do a round of buffs/nerfs soon
[3:23:43] LateNightG: There are a crap ton of people that enjoy actually doing the finding. I have large chunk of people in my guild that will not look up rune info and just want to find it via in game means. They could care less about the raid or reaching 25
[3:23:46] ambiotic: sounds like an aotc take
[3:23:47] Velanthos: by the time most guilds clear its a differnt fight anyways
[3:24:09] Nerendis: @ambiotic this
[3:24:11] KonceptionZ: man wants the race to world first to last months lol
[3:24:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: To me it's just crazy to make content that only 5% of people can do
[3:24:15] Tazurith: if RWF are struggling, im pretty glad they nerf it cause the normie is never doing it otherwise
[3:24:16] rbgdev: I don’t like how they treat billionaires so it makes me not want to be rich anymore :(
[3:24:18] j_bar111: I think the combinations of runes and talents is going to be nutty once we get more talent points in SOD
[3:24:18] DeanoTV: People have grown up, they dont have time for that shit
[3:24:20] pbnj_kills: I'm not gonna raid a tier for 6 months just cause it's hard
[3:24:26] ambiotic: when you are on a last boss for a month and the mechanics are just to hard for normal guilds gota nerf that shit
[3:24:41] chefdejour82: 3 sec seeds
[3:24:43] AzedaNA: I mean I sort of find it a bit foolish they make fights specifically overtuned for these guilds. The fight should be the same fight for everyone. Not make it super strong and then tone it down a few weeks later
[3:24:59] Molvonos: People complaining about Race to World First nerfs/buffs while being LFR heros is like your average citizen bitching about billionaires getting taxed for having over 100k annual.

[3:25:01] Molvonos: The fuck.
[3:25:08] king_julian_96: will blizzard just turn BFD to a regular dungeon again when phase 2 of SoD or no
[3:25:13] Molvonos: Doesnt affect you at all.
[3:25:25] pbnj_kills: no one wants to raid a tier for 6 months
[3:25:29] extrnl2: @AzedaNA think this is the only middle ground they can have where they have compelling race but still doable for normies
[3:25:33] Nerendis: @Molvonos Never met someone complain about RWF who has cleared AOTC frankly
[3:25:38] Velanthos: theres too mkuch information out there for that
[3:25:41] ambiotic: Shit after Mauru they havent done that since
[3:25:42] runehako: 2023 and i still cant show my hair through my hat :(
[3:25:49] UltraKSlaya: we need more players to the game! not complication to scare people away
[3:26:00] Molvonos: @Nerendis No kidding.
[3:26:25] AzedaNA: I don't understand how games like FFXIV can have 0 PTRs and still release good content/raids
[3:26:31] king_julian_96: what’s the most amounts of wipes ever on a boss
[3:26:32] Nerendis: Mythic raiding is also such a SMALL subset of the playerbase. There is a billion other things for players to do. Never understood the complaint.
[3:26:37] ambiotic: yea most guilds are going to be progging heroic and by the time we get to mythic that shit has been killed for weeks
[3:26:40] Spekky: nono, they make a raid and it's only open for 1 day. then nobody will share :D
[3:26:40] Screamnsteam: @AzedaNA Based

[3:27:08] Stariot: is there a different link for your classic UI @Towelliee
[3:27:28] wesley_dalton: @Towelliee are there vaults in classic?
[3:27:31] Gotxiko: the question should be, "are they fun? are they challenging enough?"
[3:27:41] Scarhearth: I dont understand why people complain about blizzard trying to not get into an arms race with the RTWF guilds lol
[3:27:47] ambiotic: Max wants no dungeon journal
[3:27:49] Julinde: Element of surprise has to be on a personal end. There are actually a few guilds on FF (they're YT streamers) that purposely never look at any fights so they can enjoy the fight and figure things out on their own
[3:27:53] ambiotic: thinks that will be big
[3:27:56] dChotaz: !blizzard

[3:27:57] adxx: this ain’t 2005 anymore where websites, YouTube and information was still very limited. “figuring things out” isn’t in our day and age anymore lol
[3:28:16] ThorH13: Sup guys
[3:28:17] ackdogg007: until it becomes more then a 2 team race who really gives a shit about the race
[3:28:21] Molvonos: @Julinde Imagine, people holding themselves accountable to what they do and do not learn about new content.
[3:28:23] Velanthos: it might also give some different comps going into the race as well, if you dont know what the fights look like from testing/journal
[3:28:25] NickyNiclas: If the journal goes, wowhead needs to go as well
[3:28:25] TexRex_86: have the journal fill up after its played
[3:28:26] king_julian_96: god no going to make fights way harder
[3:28:39] Nerendis: I mean, just look at BFD right now
[3:28:43] ambiotic: which is ok for normal guilds but will make the race more fun is the thought
[3:28:46] Sollice: @NickyNiclas wowhead needs to go because of no journal on raid?
[3:28:50] Sollice: HOT TAKE FRIENDS
[3:28:50] ThorH13: our guild on Living flames was Horde server first for BFD :D
[3:28:58] itzknockers: as u progress the joournal fills up
[3:29:02] Julinde: @Molvonos I know. It's crazy, lol. For me, I'm of the latter that does like to know the fight before hand. But I love watching them because it's fun to see how they do things.
[3:29:03] Molvonos: @NickyNiclas lmao
[3:29:07] Velanthos: this chat is on one today lol
[3:29:17] Molvonos: BECAUSE BLIZZARD AND WOWHEAD ARE THE SAME ENTITY, RIGHT?
[3:29:18] Screamnsteam: @Towelliee you know longer need to go in BFD to get the orbs, you can kill the elite trash outside of the raid and get the orbs
[3:29:19] dguap: then they can put the WF race behind a paywall to get the information 😂
[3:29:24] Memrunos: @Molvonos it's easy to have that conviction personally, but expecting the other 19 people to not read the journal might be too much to ask
[3:29:41] Sollice: lol
[3:29:43] Velanthos: prob more splits initially tho
[3:29:46] Screamnsteam: Gasp
[3:29:59] Velanthos: since they might now have the comps outllined ahead of time
[3:29:59] mox2g: @Screamnsteam orbs for what
[3:30:01] Molvonos: @Memrunos And?  That's still a you problem.  You either have a guild/group that has the same convictions as you, or you don't.
[3:30:01] DunzoCD: towBlind
[3:30:02] N7Spectr3: Shame that man for being late. Shame him!
[3:30:02] ambiotic: Yea I think for comps/gearing it would be a new ball game, I think they all thought that comps were known from day one was a big negative of this race
[3:30:04] Sollice: I think he should be in shambles
[3:30:04] Velanthos: not*
[3:30:08] king_julian_96: what’s the most attempts ever recorded to kill a boss
[3:30:11] Screamnsteam: @mox2g warlock meta rune
[3:30:22] luchion09: ur lock 25 yet @Towelliee
[3:30:22] mox2g: ah ty
[3:30:27] trollinmyimp: *Hands Scream some burn cream*
[3:30:36] luchion09: nice 1
[3:30:37] SuperxTurk: Im only lvl 16 on my lock does getting meta tank take long?
[3:30:44] ClassicMalcontent: Maintenance longer than 15 minutes... caffeinating intensifies
[3:30:45] Nerendis: 700 ish
[3:30:49] Nerendis: kj
[3:30:50] ambiotic: Yea
[3:30:55] ambiotic: it was close to 2k
[3:30:56] Nerendis: That was the kill
[3:31:01] Crutchie: realm list is up
[3:31:02] Brodih_: thats fucking degen number of attemps
[3:31:03] ambiotic: they killed argus in like 1000 pulls to
[3:31:07] Crutchie: realms arent though
[3:31:07] chefdejour82: no thanks
[3:31:08] brizzom: realm list up
[3:31:09] Nerendis: 700 was the kill for method
[3:31:15] Velanthos: @SuperxTurk without a group myou will get crushed on some of the quests, but if you have people to help you could do it
[3:31:16] Ckraigfriend: will this week be easy to kill those bosses?
[3:31:19] ambiotic: they were the first streaming guild and started RWF
[3:31:21] AnimalCrackers_19: Please stop swallowing air, sir
[3:31:22] chuckiethegreat: chuckiethegreat subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[3:31:33] toobaked1987: Not going right into opening your vault? Towelliee is SoD hooked.
[3:31:47] Nerendis: I thought the question meant, whats the most pulls a boss took for WF. Theoretically some shitter AOTC guild could pull a boss 5k times rofl
[3:31:48] Crutchie: Crutchie subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:31:50] edeasknight: kj, the birth of mathematically impossible memes 👀
[3:31:51] ambiotic: cause after argus method saw how many viewers they got and streamed uldir
[3:31:52] Berexios123: most pulls ive even done was 500 plus on argus it was not fun
[3:32:07] DeanoTV: yep so stupid
[3:32:21] ambiotic: yea but normal guilds dont really use the journal so that would be funny to see what happens
[3:32:24] diesel1324: How many people actually use the journal compared to them waiting to be told what to do and what happens?
[3:32:27] extrnl2: there will always be some people loudly complaining about anything
[3:32:44] Molvonos: https://i.imgur.com/SydexbI.jpg @Towelliee
[3:32:52] Celicon: so wait they changed the the meta rune? not behind a raid now?
[3:32:53] Manabucho: just take away the abillities and keep in the loot display

[3:33:33] ZeRoHOOTz_: did they change rogue rep wall?
[3:33:37] Screamnsteam: can you do it solo or you need a party?
[3:33:38] Nerendis: @Molvonos "I want to discover on my own" - but only if I'm not the only one discovering on my own. Giga HUH mentality.
[3:33:44] Celicon: lol
[3:33:47] ambiotic: I think this has been a fantastic raid tho and it got me back after shadowlands so they are doing something right
[3:33:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: the poor bastards that probably paid all their gold to get in a bfd for the drops LUL
[3:33:50] Molvonos: lolol
[3:33:55] cyrex172: its sooo funny how blizz fucked with all the warlocks
[3:33:57] Clicklesly: It's still pretty much capped though
[3:33:59] cyrex172: for like 2 weeks
[3:34:02] Velanthos: it wouldnt be so bad but where the trash you needed was took a while if you werent already basically full clearing
[3:34:12] im_capy: FoMo too strong for some
[3:34:14] UnearthedSin: Sham Earth shield rune still needs BFD first boss :(
[3:34:14] TweektheProphet: I liked max suggestion for an end of expac event, they create 1 tough boss and do an MDI style tournament relm to 50 guilds are invited to join

[3:36:56] abbott012: yeah even gingi is playing sod
[3:37:04] ambiotic: season 3 has just been too good
[3:37:06] im_capy: SoD 2 after and it continues LUL
[3:37:07] ambiotic: the dungeons slap
[3:37:09] Masqerader: they can always cata classic and get ptsd from spine when that drops
[3:37:09] Scarhearth: when are we expecting cata classic to come out
[3:37:15] Nebulizer87: yeah its so fun to watch Max hop into giga groups zzzzz
[3:37:22] TheGiant99: Retail is just better then classic
[3:37:25] Bowwjack: @Towelliee how about those tendral and Fryakk nerfs ;)
[3:37:34] Masqerader: only thing left is mdi and awc content for some of them guild memebers
[3:37:45] ambiotic: ya
[3:37:46] Masqerader: *members
[3:38:05] neftario105: Classic retail both are great
[3:38:06] ambiotic: that is a huge nerf, but a good one cause that shit would be impossible for anything under world 5th
[3:38:10] Shugaze: SOD will get even better with time
[3:38:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: AWC could be February
[3:38:21] lastdeviljoker666: classic is for mikes
[3:38:24] im_capy: By far
[3:38:26] DunzoCD: agreed, even SoD feels so slow
[3:38:38] Q_TheDreamer: classic is easy to understand from a viewer perspective. Especially for someone unfamiliar with WoW
[3:38:40] Wulfgrym: there is a wow for everyone now
[3:38:40] DeanoTV: I cant stand auto attack simulator LUL
[3:38:44] UltraKSlaya: they should combine the best of retail and classic lol
[3:38:48] TheGiant99: Classic is so slow
[3:38:48] ambiotic: I will play cata classic tho for firelands
[3:38:52] ambiotic: that i will commit to
[3:38:59] Xx__Devon__xX: do you think SOD opens the doors for classic +?
[3:39:00] im_capy: Retail to new players just looks like a ton for flashy colors. They have no idea what they are watching. We saw it for years in PvP
[3:39:02] extrnl2: @Q_TheDreamer totally agree
[3:39:06] adxx: anyone remember wild star?
[3:39:11] ixiya_ink: morning towelliee

[3:39:17] ZeusDNA: @Xx__Devon__xX SoD is that lol...
[3:39:21] Holysal: I like the pace of classic. especially with one hand
[3:39:22] devilhawk83: Just imagine Cataclysm Classic Hardcore LUL
[3:39:24] Nebulizer87: i tried SoD i understand the appeal for certain players but its just to slow for me
[3:39:28] drunkieduckie: sod seems like a good step moving forward.  a little old and a little new
[3:39:29] ambiotic: I watched my heroic rag video this weekend and that fight is still going to be hard
[3:39:30] mobbo: @towelliee Justin TV days of Cata Towelliee
[3:39:34] gfield2k: Oh you started in Cata @Towelliee? Thought you were a day one day one
[3:39:35] Masqerader: should play a rogue again so i can drop 10k on the legendary quest for dragon soul for rogue
[3:39:37] Celicon: @im_capy yep that’s why I play classic
[3:39:45] DunzoCD: @Xx__Devon__xX towCopium thinking SoD isnt classic +
[3:39:46] GhostVenn: How is SOD up before regular?>

[3:39:53] gfield2k: Oh okay
[3:39:58] NickyNiclas: I remember watching towelliee stream firelands long ass time ago

[3:41:00] xpadeDK: @Scarhearth dk for sure
[3:41:03] Loeken1: Cata killed me, I was a warlock main in Wotlk, and in Cata my guild says "we need you to tank". Then proceeded to not help me grind up a tank or gear it, and shocked pickachu face when I was under geared to off tank the raid.  I bounced for about 5 years.
[3:41:04] Screamnsteam: im sure what you have is better

[4:23:46] Se7enthSinn: damn still no Fyrakk on FLR
[4:23:58] SittingCoach: Any1 know how to get it for undead warlock?
[4:23:58] damage666: You dont need to drain soul anything, just need to turn in and accept new quest from guy at the end
[4:24:07] PlatOnMyMain: hell yah brother
[4:24:11] oldmanrohnin: click it
[4:24:23] damage666: @SittingCoach Same process
[4:24:31] oldmanrohnin: click on the altar
[4:24:37] SittingCoach: Ashenvale?
[4:24:55] damage666: questie supposedly blocks the quest popup at the end
[4:24:58] Oceansevan: you have to get the KB on the infernal, or it will bug and fail
[4:24:59] valianya: @towelliee you have to get the killing tick with drain soul on the infernal while it's inside the circle
[4:25:05] HexedPk: you dont gotta turn it off...
[4:25:11] HexedPk: i did it with it on
[4:25:11] SI7ekeko: questie can bug the quest
[4:25:14] pk99: questie doesn't matter.
[4:25:18] FusionKissMe: turn off questie
[4:25:20] hxrvick: have to get final blow on the last infernal
[4:25:30] pk99: it was just people not getting the killing blow thinking it was questie
[4:25:34] Minoumi: 3-4 waves
[4:25:34] Oceansevan: you dont have to drain soul, staysafe got the KB on the infernal without DS, and he got credit
[4:25:43] valianya: Individual credit
[4:25:53] Screamnsteam: you dont need killing blow anymore
[4:26:19] oldmanrohnin: just need to talk to npc that spawns after event
[4:26:20] strongstout: rune quests havent been showing up in questie for me
[4:26:26] mmo_kenna_: This is some old school classic warlock quest shit...nice
[4:26:47] RolexKT: This bit of the quest isvery confusing
[4:26:48] Pharaoh_326: can they share it?
[4:26:48] mmo_kenna_: I did the one for mount back in the day
[4:27:05] oldmanrohnin: quest comes from npc, not altar
[4:27:06] Avinar: doesn't matter much as long as the dude spawns. I turned in mine after the event was done and then talked to the guy
[4:27:09] valianya: Tis part of the quest is Individual credit
[4:27:15] Zirist: drain soul*
[4:27:20] RolexKT: That's it, now go back to barrens
[4:27:28] Minoumi: done !
[4:27:31] SI7ekeko: thats it you done
[4:27:31] SultabMN: !Guild
[4:27:51] Avinar: it's a bit janky and old school feeling haha
[4:28:00] AzedaNA: best part of the Meta rune for Alliance? No more Gnome Warlocks
[4:28:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: questie won't show this quest
[4:28:12] Clicklesly: Azshara FP first?
[4:29:11] HexedPk: when ur 40 u solo it lmao
[4:29:13] mmo_kenna_: That's classic tho
[4:29:20] RolexKT: Yea it's very unfriendly for catch up
[4:29:21] luchion09: how long u do u stay in demon form for ?
[4:29:29] DaBestGAround: @Towelliee Blizz said the rune quest will be different in later phases to counterbalance that
[4:29:32] Deekan33: ?? what lvl are mobs
[4:29:50] Nerendis: retail with 2004 graphics
[4:29:50] yadungoofed101: retail minus for sure
[4:29:52] mmo_kenna_: Difference between retail and classic, old school jank Vs efficiency and QOL
[4:29:54] Ranthyr_: almost retail without mounts so far haha
[4:30:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: i would go around the warsong camp LUL
[4:30:01] Aquoia: the box rep gating is my biggest problem with runes, just make them not unique
[4:30:07] Avinar: reminds me of legion but with an old school quest vibe
[4:30:08] chefdejour82: thats why they shouldnt be in a dungeon
[4:30:22] Avinar: makes sense because tank rune
[4:30:32] ArcaneSyntax: i imagine Divine Storm will be too
[4:30:37] Screamnsteam: Kappa
[4:30:44] chefdejour82: maybe at late game you need items from dungeon
[4:30:47] Treevinal: yeah miscommunication but we tested internally...
[4:30:52] mmo_kenna_: Warlock mount quest was the same back in the day, you needed a party
[4:30:55] Wulfgrym: the sweaty nerd was okay with it
[4:31:00] Avinar: i just did the raid for the runes right before the changes
[4:31:21] Wulfgrym: yeah 80 percent nerf to mage heal but tested KEKW

[4:31:23] J_Walch: did u ahve to drain soul?
[4:31:27] Clicklesly: That quest has always been in Wow, the issue was BFD became a raid
[4:31:28] menzo1337: Not too surprising. QA doesn't know what the rules would be or that this one shouldn't have been in the raid.
[4:31:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: just get on the main road
[4:31:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: to the north
[4:31:49] pennell10: no bridge
[4:31:57] ItsTheBez: i'd rather have it be in a raid vs. rep gated
[4:32:44] raldrik: doesnt that really hurt your next progression?
[4:32:48] Avinar: yeah I was getting rich fast and I wasn't expecting it. when I did BFD I somehow made 8g

[4:33:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: i plan to dungeon level next phase so yeah gonna try to go as many quests as i can for gold
[4:33:14] DiedBySteel: hello everyone
[4:33:16] mavericks312: id rather it be from a simple quest early so i can use the rune an not in a raid at max level an i may quit soon after lol
[4:33:35] Avaniss_: but its not max lvl 60 will be
[4:33:40] Treevinal: not much to learn, I have less spells then a retail BM hunter
[4:33:42] Avinar: especially if this wasn't changed in season 2, then you'd need to be 30+ when soloing this quest lol
[4:33:48] Clicklesly: Yeah, putting the mobs outside the raid doesn't really change this is still a max level thing
[4:33:59] Zazzi1019: is SOD hardcore mode too?
[4:34:12] Deekan33: Next phase will be interesting for those that complete tons of quest and have none to do for the first few lvls.
[4:34:19] Lawlorcoaster: what's good towelliee, how's SOD so far? haven't jumped in yet
[4:34:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep, level 10 to figure out what kind of spec and role you want to play
[4:34:20] Wulfgrym: King Menehill was the Goat
[4:34:29] kandorkaboom: Think about the fact though that there could be new specs / playstyles unlocked in each phase of SOD too....
[4:34:39] Clicklesly: You can just go in 26+ dungeons for next phase ^^

[4:46:07] Dalinaar: Crit from int good for threat?

[4:46:20] zorebotswow: can you look at your defensive stats
[4:46:27] Celicon: you probably need the mana pool
[4:46:33] scramperlive: Stam > Int = Agi > spirit > anything else. Need some int for SP/Mana, but otherwise AGI will win out for defensive
[4:46:34] NotD4k: shield Prayge
[4:46:37] Nerendis: Armor doesn't matter if you can't hold threat
[4:46:39] mooseon: @mavericks312 its for dodge

[5:27:33] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Towelliee ebay authentication is psa brother lol
[5:27:40] grumpzzzz: depends on who the authenticator is, some can be super judging, it happened twice to me
[5:27:50] Se7enthSinn: that's good though.. for buyers
[5:27:52] rbgdev: if you don’t have photo proof from before it was sent it’s a tough situation
[5:27:58] Kaykerrs: yep
[5:27:59] grumpzzzz: @Foxdoabarrelrofl not true, they 3rd party it
[5:28:02] valianya: Someone in authentication swapped your card or mixed it up with someone else's card
[5:28:03] NobodybetterPat: what card?
[5:28:12] AzedaNA: So what if they send the card back damaged? That is rage inducing

[5:28:37] Foxdoabarrelrofl: look at the addresses lmfao
[5:28:44] OhHiImRob: oh damn
[5:28:51] Kaykerrs: yea he sent it to ebay's authentication HQ and they said no bueno @extrnl2
[5:29:01] 91Niki: I'd still take pics to have proof, just in case someone fucks you over somewhere. You have proof
[5:29:02] polaropposite76: @extrnl2 yeah it's a new thing they started doing where they authenticate the card first so when you send it out it goes to ebay before the buyer.
[5:29:12] Kaykerrs: fortunately that has never happened to me but it has to some of my friends
[5:29:30] NobodybetterPat: make sure u record u opening the package when u get it.
[5:29:36] extrnl2: that's encouraging imo, WAY less room for fuckery/scams if it has only been to ebay

[5:41:37] MackPlays: RP was GTA online
[5:41:40] JoshuaTree6969: how mad are they that the video got leaked
[5:41:43] MoodyVanessa: yeah it's probably too early to tell
[5:41:44] MackPlays: A whole separate game
[5:42:02] Crutchie: rockstar hasnt confirmed or denied it
[5:42:08] Rakim88: ppl r guessing its way too early n rockstar isnt saying anything yet

[5:43:38] ParfumAmerican: incinerate- searing?
[5:43:39] SpoofAvatar: saering tab searing tab searing tab
[5:43:45] FusionKissMe: meta tanks def need more threat
[5:43:49] EthicalHermit: dots on off targets imo
[5:44:08] Rakim88: just lifetap more 4Head
[5:44:08] luchion09: can u mana tap etc while in that form ?
[5:44:16] ParfumAmerican: try incinarate searing
[5:44:32] luchion09: thats sick
[5:44:32] mmrghost7: dont aggro more than 2 target it will be miserable to hold aggro
[5:44:32] Avinar: cant fear sadly
[5:44:35] Seerated: Buuut, your defensives are always up through the Meta so why wouldn't channeled spells work ? The spells themselves don't say they nullify or ?

[5:46:20] Colt_Engineer: did vengeance dh get a new glyph today?

[5:55:31] fakevaltteri: That what the she demon said
[5:55:42] YZIOHP: I think choice between void walker and meta would have been cool
[5:56:32] dwsunshine: !lurk  dwsunsLove  dwsunsLove  dwsunsLove
[5:56:37] Avinar: I wonder if they will make the fel hunter pet give mana to the warlock in a future rune or something
[5:56:54] Shuttlelol: meta is so massive lol
[5:56:59] Seerated: Have to say, it looks utterly amazing that this exists. Such a good move by Blizz, easy $$$$

[5:57:36] WoW_StandalonE: u should life tap all the time when hp is above 80%
[5:57:37] Trawkey: Thought about it yesterday when i had a warlock tank in sfk. Was super annoying
[5:58:36] Wulfgrym: @Trawkey when i had a warlock run by me last night in wetlands i was like damn those wings are going to be a bitch for melee

[6:01:58] PvtHudson093: Hey Tow, anything good in vault?
[6:02:38] SonofHorus82: how's warlock tank feel? holding threat ok?
[6:02:45] brostro93: delay on first damage from rain of fire kinda sucks
[6:03:21] demonicyoshi: why are u not dotting with corruption its insta cast
[6:03:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: We need more dam
[6:03:33] Avinar: one thing I will say is I do feel rather tanky
[6:04:03] dualz6045: Can't spend GCDs on corruption or we lose threat. Can squeeze them in here and there, but it is rough
[6:04:03] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[6:04:10] Avinar: yeah, you gotta spam life tap a lot
[6:04:11] Jacinez: I think instant RoF with a small cd in meta would fix issue
[6:04:22] fateisblissful: That's the only complaint with meta so far, is AoE tanking is a bit painful
[6:04:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: drain life and life tap if you can
[6:04:44] fateisblissful: With improved lifetap talents, you get around 250 mana per life tap
[6:04:53] Amarlian: I thought rain of fire was the play, put it down then cancel to have the mobs sit in the puddle @Towelliee
[6:05:09] Zomgboy: immune to life
[6:05:19] dualz6045: You don't lol
[6:05:19] fateisblissful: They're immune to shadow damage
[6:05:20] mmrghost7: u cant
[6:05:24] Avinar: that's the neat part, you don't
[6:05:25] Zomgboy: you wave at him
[6:05:26] twarnak: As a warrior
[6:05:32] Gregadeaux: bet they introduce more tank runes
[6:05:35] Rakim88: u dont 4Head
[6:05:36] solor3544: thought it was bad going into SFK as a Tauren prot pally
[6:05:39] DogShep: You're going to get a rune that changes your damage type is my guess
[6:05:58] Avinar: we shall see what they do
[6:06:04] vargath_: silenced life
[6:06:12] brostro93: tell em buff meh bruh
[6:06:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[6:06:36] Avinar: I SORT OF expect some rune that turns our damage into FEL damage in the future to be resisted less.
[6:06:38] Wulfgrym: KEKW
[6:06:43] Avinar: dudes just flexing on you now
[6:06:48] Rakim88: les is trolling u KEKW
[6:06:48] MattyNiceTV: KEKW
[6:06:57] chefdejour82: classic life
[6:07:04] Wulfgrym: les ls like...im the tank now
[6:07:05] vargath_: doesn't trust a warlock
[6:07:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: He's off tanking!
[6:07:22] Spykex02: ngl holding aoe aggro here seems like a chore...
[6:07:41] Wulfgrym: look at me dropdaddy, im the tank now
[6:07:49] dualz6045: Few nice things that could help and be cool. Something like shadow cleave applies corruption and searing pain hits all enemies in range affected by corruption (I assume capped at like 3-5)
[6:08:07] Avinar: curious on the future of lock tanking

[6:08:23] Wulfgrym: LUL
[6:08:23] Amarlian: I am sure they will sort it out
[6:08:38] Wulfgrym: im hoping they do something cuz fire damage molten core..LUL
[6:08:46] Avinar: warlock tanking "let me just silence..wait.. stun.. wait.."
[6:08:53] JoeHeff: This is even worse than I expected. Did blizz test any of this?
[6:09:03] Wulfgrym: hey!!! 80 percent nerf to mages, no such thing
[6:09:17] FLCarguy: any guildies up for a BFD raid later this afternoon?
[6:09:18] SamuraiWillZ916: maybe you need to tank with a war or pally?
[6:09:20] SamuraiWillZ916: lol
[6:09:22] JoeHeff: This makes me wonder if the whole warlock tank thing is just an internet meme, not an actual blizz intention...
[6:09:23] GodTheMechanic: Tanking MC and BL as a lock is gonna be a blast
[6:09:26] Avinar: need some fel fire damage. also doesn't help that two abilities for warlock are at 26. searing pain rank 2 is at 26 lmao
[6:09:36] xmedpakx: @JoeHeff what ya mean its being tested now lolol
[6:09:45] Shuttlelol: BFD resets tomorrow so good time to do it
[6:09:49] FLCarguy: @Towelliee would love to heal it but have a work call the next three hours :(
[6:09:52] GodTheMechanic: They have to do something to turn it into shadow damage or something like that as one of the later runes, or as a class quest
[6:09:54] Wulfgrym: @xmedpakx  true!
[6:10:07] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee How was the vaults today?
[6:10:08] Shuttlelol: @FLCarguy 3 hour work call should be illegal
[6:10:19] FLCarguy: I know right!
[6:10:21] JoeHeff: @xmedpakx LUL
[6:10:25] FLCarguy: at least we get two 5 minute breaks :)
[6:10:41] Shuttlelol: any meeting over an hour gets auto declined
[6:10:49] Seerated: I mean, spells are still 16% chance to miss like Vanilla or did they change that also ? Would've to be evend out if so on other stuff
[6:10:59] Avinar: fel magic run that turns spells into fire+shadow and give immolation aura pls as a rune pls.
[6:11:14] Amarlian: "Dear Blizzard, you are close but It needs some improvements"

[6:11:41] BubbaChubbs420: do you not have any aoe threat?
[6:11:41] CardinalTX: Does spirit boost hp regen at all?
[6:11:44] Wulfgrym: gotta be careful unless they balance it so warlocks don't go tank mode and smash with thir spells in pvp etc
[6:11:50] Amarlian: Yeah, it's close just needs some touch ups here and there
[6:11:51] Nokterian: But warlocks cant tank! Warlocks always have been tanks
[6:11:52] Molvonos: @CardinalTX Yes.  HP and Mana regen
[6:11:58] jarilrpg: @towelliee does the shadow bolt volley rune work with the meta version of shadow bolt?

[6:12:46] Zirist: well that makes sense
[6:12:49] Amarlian: Maybe send him the community guidelines on trolling @Towelliee
[6:12:50] Dokeefe1986: Miracle? Idk. Private servers have had this already and more for a long time. I know it's retail but still. That's them getting in their own way, nothing else imo. Shrug. Maybe I digress
[6:13:04] nevercluckyy: i feel like all they would have to do is dramatically buff shadowcleave threat generation even if they leave the damage the same and it wouldnt be terrible
[6:13:16] Molvonos: @Dokeefe1986 Private servers are shit though, and aren't comparable to the actual game.  But yes, you digress.
[6:13:23] Submarine_Mike: Threat meter?

[6:15:09] forgel28: isn’t server down?????
[6:15:33] peppep330: how's lock tank feeling?
[6:15:45] Brodih_: why do people ask these questions when they can clearly say that you are playing
[6:15:50] Brodih_: see*
[6:15:56] twarnak: Shaman tank is probably way more fun
[6:15:58] Molvonos: @Brodih_ Secret Streamer only server.
[6:15:59] SonofHorus82: are you going to try Rogue and Shaman tanking too?
[6:16:02] PvtHudson093: Chat did he get anything good in vault today?
[6:16:18] Seerated: Looks awesome but abit clunky perhaps, no real red line in how to
[6:16:23] MattyNiceTV: you can't
[6:16:25] pruteee: No
[6:16:30] PvtHudson093: con is 11 points
[6:16:31] mmrghost7: but WL tank is superior on single target
[6:16:37] Avinar: I think you'd need at least 30ish
[6:17:00] Molvonos: Thiccboy Locktank pulled adds with wingspan, news at 11.
[6:17:07] ArcaneSyntax: command isn't aoe in classic, so it sucks for tanking
[6:17:25] ninetynil: go get em boys
[6:17:31] Avinar: they are also rather tanky too i feel. they feel rather solid for me to offset all the life tapping i gotta do lmao

[6:18:28] ArcaneSyntax: that pack is bugged, pulled for me too, you have to focus the one add that's pulling to get through
[6:18:37] vodkablaq: always blame the hunter lol

[6:25:14] Roughneck124: I leveled on a pvp server back in the day and it took me forever to lvl because I played alone. If I only knew about the pve servers, i would have hit max lvl faster. I was just unaware

[6:26:20] SpoofAvatar: We had to time all the world buffs for Loatheb
[6:26:21] Avinar: I just knew that it happened but not where from. I remember getting dragonslayer and being all "WOOO"
[6:26:23] extrnl2: the thing with vanilla is you really only needed like 20 of hte 40man raid to be competent
[6:26:32] Gotxiko: and now its like "you need 12 world buffs for Scholo"
[6:26:46] SpoofAvatar: nef, ony and zg world buffs for loatheb, that was fun stuff
[6:26:52] Wulfgrym: pvp is a young person's thing

[6:37:18] K_Kasual: @TweektheProphet i went to a paintball bachelor party as well and it was probably one of the most fun ones i've ben to
