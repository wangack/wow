[1:36:46] Skynet_1000: new class confirmed will be sold on WoW ingame Shop
[1:36:46] Thunderbrew: Blizzard needs to work on getting their shit together.
[1:36:51] cendriii: how many % have gotten that mount from drop u think
[1:36:59] Rudric_Ice: they can't even balance the ones that we have LUL
[1:36:59] Secondbreakfasttt: I couldn't agree more
[1:37:00] smellybeard: they need to overhaul tank mechanics, instead of "swap at 3 stacks"
[1:37:01] lithium364: Bard PogChamp
[1:37:03] XshadowturkeyX: LUL id love that
[1:37:05] Crowargus: i dunno weve had most of these classes a long time its nice to get something new to play
[1:37:06] dalaraz: longshot but,id love if all classes were merged to 2 specs than 3,for balancing issues and numbers etc
[1:37:06] captivated_gg: they can add a demonhunter caster specc^^
[1:37:10] Nyrocxx: everyones and their own LUL

[1:37:17] Furinax: ?*
[1:37:20] Thoreya: it doesnt look good on them if other MMOs make classes and they dont
[1:37:30] Craziex: one is bit too boring tbh, 5 classes and revamp the meta completly
[1:37:33] Malarick: they should give us an expac based on the AprilFools Day patch notes
[1:37:35] Thoreya: every expansion that gave us a new class was a good expansion
[1:37:41] Pulpkitchen: @captivated_gg you mean a demo wlock?
[1:37:54] yazzi152: remove all the  new dumb crap  they have added
[1:37:58] feherlofia123: theres a classless version of classic vanilla, where u can mix all skills from allclasses, they could learn a thing or two from that

[1:38:19] sirmiras: FeeelsGoodMan 📢
[1:38:19] ravic8: remove 20 different systems per exp
[1:38:20] dalaraz: mixing some claasses to 2 specs would solve many of their problems
[1:38:23] sirmiras: FeelsGoodMan 📢
[1:38:29] Nehcrom: They can in all honesty still work on culture, mindset AND a new class for the next expansion. I don't see them as exclusive.
[1:38:37] dalaraz: like why rogue and mage and lock still have 3 specs,and 1 or 2 are permanent unplayable

[1:57:41] dalaraz: they make money from transfer,why would they merge
[1:57:43] Gingerprimer: More dungeons next expansion plz
[1:57:56] ravic8: i want crossfaction so bad sick of playing horde
[1:57:57] Exodeo_: Try recruiting mythic raiders to a  low pop realm then get back to me ;p
[1:58:11] Cafe0le: cross faction arenas Kreygasm
[1:58:20] zenity360: well you already know haha
[1:58:40] ladydaisy1978: Cross faction guilds, i would go Alliance so fast!
[1:58:47] Screamnsteam: The money they save from server merges could be a raise for bobby kotick EZ
[1:59:06] Skorb: Maybe they'll add in more language stuff so you can "learn" Horde or Alliance languages for cross faction play.
[1:59:13] captivated_gg: !guild

[1:59:22] SmygandeFizen: I hope not tbh, making cross faction will just eliminate all of what is left of horde vs ally and honestly would just boost ally players in pve specially....
[1:59:24] Exodeo_: I have to constantly ask people if they'd consider joining our server before we even get to the details, it's frustrating
[1:59:29] Kisswani: that wont be solved until you can pug mythic raids from the start
[1:59:30] Masqerader: mythic + for x faction, a bigger pool of players for mythic + would also be nice too. When I look at Alliance compared to horde mythic + dungeon finder it really is night and day
[1:59:35] jamb0gaming: @towelliee if activision has us dropping in and hunting for weapons to conquer on bgs im done 😂😂😂
[1:59:38] cendriii: worldbosstimer gives the time when he spwan
[1:59:45] Kelticlore: I'm wondering how cross faction merging will affect older quests like in wod
[1:59:50] pavepawns: i cant wait for cross faction
[1:59:51] Korupcija_: lol ban that guy
[1:59:53] Korupcija_: KEKW
[2:00:05] pavepawns: i will constantly grip all gnomes to their doom
[2:00:05] Thoreya: blizz needs to get with the times....cross faction makes the game more accessible
[2:00:10] Thoreya: which the game desperately needs
[2:00:10] Odinslayer: its NA vs EU now
[2:00:19] zenity360: that ship sailed after wod
[2:00:21] Kisswani: I kinda do , not for any principle or reason other than " it's always been like that "
[2:00:22] Kelticlore: I feel horde v alliance sailed around cata or mop
[2:00:31] Koppermonty: The issue is, Blizzard are happy to live on the monthly subscriptions. Until the community actually stop funding them, they will just continue to ignore Wow development.
[2:00:31] smellybeard: we have been through some shit over 17 years
[2:00:47] Masqerader: Horde vs Alliance is so antiquated system. Story wise it don't make sense.   The only time people had faction pride was when Metzen was screaming where my HORDE at Blizzcon lol
[2:00:49] Thoreya: its the last "chapter" of the first book. its a new era for wow
[2:01:01] lithium364: bring back garrosh SMOrc  kill all vulpera SMOrc Kappa
[2:01:02] Masqerader: *is such
[2:01:06] dranet11: @Koppermonty god forbid people play a game they still enjoy
[2:01:06] Thoreya: cross faction here we come!

[2:01:26] FutileDiploma: @towelliee what would you say is the most high need build and spec for mythic plus and raiding right now
[2:01:29] cappei: Imagine thinking a system where you willingly split your playerbase in half is a good fucking system.
[2:01:29] Thoreya: they killed warmode in SL
[2:01:30] mwchaos: @dranet11 he has watched one too many bellular videos
[2:01:45] lithium364: yeah what was the point of adding warmode in bfa when they dropped it basically in sl
[2:02:11] zardistus: did my sub literally just run out?  silly ads
[2:02:11] Gingerprimer: WC3 Reign of Chaos main story is Thrall and Jaina teaming up with Nelves to fight the Legion
[2:02:14] Kisswani: but would ppl call for cross faction raiding if it wasn't for the faction imbalance ?
[2:02:18] Masqerader: watching 1 belluar video is like those old nbc frying egg commericals on nbc "this is your brain on drugs"
[2:02:18] dalaraz: i just want better or less power creep systems,dont care bout the rest
[2:02:18] Kelticlore: yes take bfa for example people were just didn't like the horde v alliance conflict imo
[2:02:28] Thoreya: instanced content should be cross faction..i think open world content should still be the same faction
[2:02:31] Havoc_S1: Is that something they are doing
[2:02:35] pavepawns: @Kisswani course they would.
[2:02:36] Koppermonty: @Koppermonty Im not telling people to stop playing. Im saying that if you want improvements and dont get them... dont pay! Pretty standard stuff like. I havent paid for wow for over 2 years now, just watch.
[2:02:37] dranet11: then it would be US rather than EU
[2:02:51] zardistus: odd.  shows I'm subbed, yet I just got ads :/
[2:03:02] Thoreya: theyll all go alliance
[2:03:11] Thoreya: if cross faction is a thing
[2:03:12] dalaraz: id love people being able to play through regions too
[2:03:17] pavepawns: i know some of limit would probably go alliance
[2:03:21] Korupcija_: oh ye they need to remove racials as well
[2:03:33] Sollice: Good morning everyone
[2:03:38] zardistus: ahhh fixed
[2:03:39] Moobot: Check out all of the new changes for WoW Classic Season of Mastery at Wowhead! https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/season-of-mastery-som-overview-wow-classic
[2:03:40] Joneeeez: I still think its kinda cool that Sylvanas is on the redemption track, the lore maybe isn't the best but its okey, still very exciting to see what's the next expansion theme is etc
[2:03:40] Masqerader: wanna do 15 key? nah my race hates you for the last 17 years even though we team up to fight a common enemy to save our world LOL
[2:03:45] Thoreya: i think a lot of limit players like alliance better
[2:03:51] Thoreya: so i wouldnt be surprised if a lot of them switch

[2:05:10] Aeylid: pre coffee cant spell
[2:05:25] Gingerprimer: @Joneeeez yeah next expansion will also have a fresh story due to them getting a new story guy that can get to do his own stuff
[2:05:25] Clicklesly: Yeah, MDI/TGP is full of Dark Iron still ^^
[2:05:33] lithium364: toxic as always kekw
[2:05:40] Rudric_Ice: rbgs are dead
[2:05:42] killswiitch: I think people would care if Blizz cared.
[2:06:00] lithium364: nazjatar warmode battles where fun, except the massive lag
[2:06:40] Rudric_Ice: I like PVP till 1800 when I get the full set
[2:06:58] Aeylid: 20%....thats generous
[2:06:59] Aeylid: :)
[2:07:17] originaladdict: @towelliee Is there still rated Battlegrounds?
[2:07:22] Kelticlore: make war mode increase the chances for world boss mount drops to drop them we'd see more people do war mode their bet
[2:07:38] Gingerprimer: TBF I think a bigger % of their team works on pvp than the % of players that actilvey play wow for pvp
[2:07:44] Masqerader: heck 20% is probably the prize pool, here is 5k for winning, that will shut them up lol
[2:07:45] othraerir: nice mount :)
[2:07:47] Cafe0le: since they forced me to do arenas in bfa for essences i barely touch pve, pvp is too addicting
[2:08:40] Tofunaator: Arena maps are nothing compared to the amount of pve content LUL

[2:09:01] Korupcija_: it's so bad
[2:09:11] Charles_Winston: If they keep allowing boosting especially for gold this game will go nowhere
[2:09:14] xlegozx: how is the population on retail nowadays
[2:09:18] lithium364: they cant even make epic battlegrounds fun anymore, theyre tedious and boring and most people just afk in them
[2:09:26] Justyy52: boosting and bots need to be removed
[2:09:28] yovi2004: !OONDASTA
[2:09:29] Moobot: @yovi2004 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[2:09:45] Masqerader: game has been around for 17 years... its gone nowhere lol
[2:09:45] Kisswani: yeah the jury is still out on WoW Kappa
[2:10:07] Kelticlore: one way to get rid of boosting is to get rid of PvP lol
[2:10:12] xlegozx: I think if they make this game free to play to population would explode
[2:10:15] Tofunaator: @justyy52 boosting cannot be removed unless they take the token out which will never happen
[2:10:23] Skorb: game masters get rid of boosting Kappa
[2:10:32] mwchaos: people still on the boosting is bad train i see
[2:10:35] lithium364: i dont care about boosting in pve, but i imagine it sucks in rated pvp
[2:10:40] Justyy52: token should buy game time, not to buy gold
[2:10:40] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://bit.ly/35GOQIN towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[2:10:43] SmygandeFizen: Then they might get rid of pve too with that logic, since equally much boosting is happening there kekW
[2:10:55] Aeylid: can't i? burn the tree!
[2:10:55] smellybeard: boosting is part of the wow life cycle
[2:10:56] Aeylid: wait
[2:10:58] Aeylid: thats doesn't work
[2:10:59] Gingerprimer: When i was in 3d grade ppl in my school talked about boosting ppl for RFC leveling runs
[2:11:01] mwchaos: yeah its a weird take
[2:11:05] af2kk: transmog in shop ?? i dont like that ....
[2:11:17] zenity360: boosting has been in wow since the beginning
[2:11:17] Gutroan: Boosting for gold is okay imo as long as you cant get gold for RL money.
[2:11:27] zenity360: I remember selling lk kills forever
[2:11:28] mwchaos: could you imagine g banks if you couldnt sell m carries prog would be rough lol
[2:11:33] Tofunaator: Boosting has been happening since forever Towel it’s just more noticiable now since they introduced wow token so gold is more “Valuable”
[2:11:34] Justyy52: @Gutroan exactly
[2:11:42] Kisswani: "gold " Kappa
[2:11:48] Tofunaator: They can’t get rid of boosting
[2:12:01] CrowCommando: Only thing that I don't like about boosting is seeing the ads everywhere.. But what can you do. Mofos gotta eat
[2:12:02] Sollice: @Tofunaator gold isn't more valueable, it's the exact opposite. Tokens have made gold more plentiful
[2:12:05] xiamrs: i fail to see how boosting affects people
[2:12:10] Kisswani: people want the spam gone I think
[2:12:12] Justyy52: get rid of token
[2:12:14] Screamnsteam: stopping boosting is like stopping the war on drugs LUL
[2:12:17] lithium364: it does ruin low rated pvp tho
[2:12:24] griffdog125: Lol getting boosted doesn’t make you a good player so doesn’t matter
[2:12:29] xXSiebzehnXx: Good morning towHAMUP towLets towGo
[2:12:31] KaisenSiru: YEP play and have fun
[2:12:32] dalaraz: how does booting ruinsthe game ?
[2:12:34] Masqerader: Most of the people who complain about are all the same, they have done nothing in the game, they say it prevents them from getting into groups....MAKE YOUR OWN
[2:12:36] bakkich: do you play Tbc Classic anymore? or planning to play later phases?
[2:12:42] MicksGames: as the world should be
[2:12:44] Kisswani: that's why Titanforging never bothered me tbh
[2:12:49] kebabgang3: Advocating against things that you do yourself like a true polititian.
[2:12:57] kochiee: are you going to raid mythic again in 9.2? @Towelliee
[2:13:00] dalaraz: to titanforge was teribad if you want bis items
[2:13:17] Joneeeez: very true
[2:13:20] Masqerader: i miss titan forging
[2:13:20] KaisenSiru: Trueeee
[2:13:22] Tofunaator: @sollice yeah i put it in quotation marks but you are right
[2:13:25] R2RHIN0: R2RHIN0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! I agree Toweeliee. You can't control what others are doing so why worry about it
[2:13:27] SaDos: @Towelliee i only dislike pvp boosting
[2:13:28] Sollice: @Towelliee You have discovered the definition of entitlement lol
[2:13:36] Zankyew: welcome to society lol
[2:13:47] danpire: what about developers not fixing major issues in there game such as lag or desync @Towelliee
[2:13:56] falldrgn: as long as im having fun.. and you are having fun.. who cares? As long as it doesn't break TOS..
[2:14:00] Kelticlore: Id like to see the older raid lock out system needs to be updated so people can help with stuff like achievements or people working on blood infusion quest

[2:14:27] Thoreya: i missed these WoW talks..feelsgoodman
[2:14:35] Kisswani: can't you ?
[2:14:37] dalaraz: we cant even fill20man guilds imagine 40 :p
[2:14:50] cendriii: yes u can buy items for gold
[2:14:56] fewyn: sounds like you can with the new gear store
[2:14:59] Masqerader: u can buy mounts and shit
[2:15:02] lithium364: i think there was an "leak" of the gear shop rework next year and the code saying it can use ingame currency
[2:15:04] Thoreya: LUL
[2:15:11] lithium364: but probably fake
[2:15:25] SmygandeFizen: If you can't fill a 20 man raid group then your Officers are doing a bad job tbh, it's really easy getting a big and good player base
[2:15:37] Masqerader: 10% nerf to health = hardmorde

[2:16:28] Kisswani: yeah I saw your tweet about the arthas statue
[2:16:30] Kelticlore: I made toons on a very dead sever to help people farm mounts
[2:16:38] Sollice: Using in game currency is a TERRIBLE idea for WoW shop. You realize they would do that so you would buy more tokens
[2:16:41] smellybeard: buying merch with in-game gold....feeels weird
[2:16:59] af2kk: as long as they dont bring back unobtainable mounts back in the shop with real money
[2:17:06] Thoreya: i feel like thats good tho
[2:17:07] Thoreya: idk
[2:17:08] Masqerader: better than using real money
[2:17:16] Sollice: and you buy them in $20 increments so you would end up spending MORE than you need to buy something for less
[2:17:18] lithium364: one way to ruin 10.0, buy the wow NFT the Bobby Milk Coin
[2:17:22] 3663Sharad: Sell out mode on the gear store LUL
[2:17:33] Masqerader: @Towelliee not really cause someone has to buy the token so they get their 20-25 dollars anyway
[2:17:36] Thoreya: i mean people gonna abuse the system one way or another
[2:17:49] kaybrink: How was the matrix?
[2:17:55] Sollice: @Masqerader That's why they would do it. So you buy more tokens

[2:44:45] PadidinJones: lol
[2:44:46] 3663Sharad: Stawp it
[2:44:51] SmygandeFizen: The problem with the Warcraft movie was that they panderd to the wrong people, instead of following the story or picking the right timeline to start with then they just jammed way to much in a bad way in a to short movie while not focusing on brining the people who play the game etc a solid movie

[2:45:52] rimurs: they did change the lore a bit on the movie i think too
[2:45:54] SmygandeFizen: But they didn't in the first movie tho, that is why so many disliked it
[2:45:55] 3663Sharad: Well to our current knowlegde Arthas is more a franchise guy (like BK oder MCDonald) to the Jailor than anything else LUL

[2:47:09] desmo7: they can't make an arthas series while the main character of the Witcher is still busy

[3:07:56] Sarocus: Sargeras just has to realiza that be got played and turn that anger on the dreadlords
[3:07:57] Smokebear: blizz needs to pull another legion all star expansion for 10.0
[3:07:59] Masqerader: he needs to pull out, and titans don't pull out
[3:08:06] dalaraz: they have to end the teaparty with illidan first
[3:08:15] Kisswani: I dont think they did sargeras dirty , there was no way we could fight him realistically

[3:08:53] bonkyouded: what would be intresting is, at the end of the jailer fight we are on azeroth but then pops sargeras back. sees the jailer and understands that he has been manipulated
[3:08:57] Skobble: !OONDASTA
[3:09:01] Smokebear: but who's manipulating Zovaal this entire time? find out in patch 11.0 !

[3:11:07] Kisswani: @swankytygerr the cinematic literally says they aren't
[3:11:21] Neyo59: except mac aree it must be hard to live on Argus
[3:11:22] dalaraz: void lords etc
[3:11:24] Wcvechten: probably void related, with how the void was seeping into the place with the ethereals
[3:11:28] xXSiebzehnXx: @motorboatingpro they’re probably just moving past the titans
[3:11:34] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: you find all the rich billionaires that fled Azeroth there
[3:11:35] killswiitch: Nothing stays dead in Warcraft LUL
[3:11:45] Smokebear: no spoilers but did you enjoy the FFXIV EW storyline
[3:11:52] Bullety: !oondasta
[3:11:53] Moobot: @Bullety 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[3:11:56] Masqerader: can we just get to the void lords already
[3:12:13] Zayocast_v2: i want to fly in silvermoon tbh Haha2020
[3:12:17] Sollice: I would think Void Lords are on pair with first ones
[3:12:25] Sollice: They are both children from the cosmic seperating
[3:12:36] Wcvechten: chronicles was written from titan POV right, atleast, that's what they conned it into
[3:12:42] diArcipE: @Towelliee I would like some biggus dickus to happen in WoW. Like a fifth war (real war, not some BFA shit). Maybe some races break out and form independence alliance and we're working against each other in world. Steal some ideas from other games could benefit wow.
[3:12:43] swankytygerr: Otherside of Azeroth
[3:12:51] xXSiebzehnXx: @sollice I think a lot of people don’t have reference points for how powerful each threat is
[3:12:53] Kisswani: hell yeah
[3:12:54] DragonofWolves: I think the issue people are having with SL storyline is that some are ok with the old lore connecting with the modern lore from SL BUT they aren't connecting it right
[3:12:59] Furinax: show us
[3:13:01] rimurs: a realm reborn, azeroth edition, with new graphics
[3:13:07] JonnyScotland: This is what happens when you have to many writers writing different stuff and not working together. All it takes is one of them to be medicre or not work with the others to mess everything up
[3:13:24] Kelticlore: So the Barrens Whole again
[3:13:27] Smokebear: We finish up in the Shadowlands and because we were in that realm for so long time is messed up and when we try to fully go back to Azeroth it's pre-sundering era
[3:13:28] DragonofWolves: I'd be up for it
[3:13:37] Ballsonfire_: !oondasta
[3:13:38] Moobot: @Balls_______________ 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[3:14:16] Rodan_____: did u watch hawkeye?
[3:14:16] DragonofWolves: Well they did say that we're returning to Azeroth next xpac so idk what that fully entails
[3:14:19] Kisswani: but pre sundering there were no humans right ? just elves and trolls ? or am i mistaken ?
[3:14:42] Wcvechten: ancient trolls xpack vs ancient old god war let's go
[3:14:44] Smokebear: how cool would it be to see the ancient Night Elf, Trolls, Tauren, etc tribes
[3:15:02] Pesho_turboto: this map has massive potential
[3:15:03] Ballsonfire_: im down for that
[3:15:03] rimurs: that's a cool idea
[3:15:11] szble: meh i want dragon isles
[3:15:12] hypno7iq: retail is dead
[3:15:15] gooball_tv: we need WoW 2!
[3:15:20] lastdeo: cataclysmn't
[3:15:35] OnceAMoose: Would be able to use The Makers as rebuilding the world.
[3:15:36] Wcvechten: We stop a timeline in which the well of eternity doesn't explode
[3:15:38] bonkyouded: @Towelliee Chromie is so underused, i want TW for more raids and dungeons. bring old content to current.
[3:15:41] Kelticlore: Night Elves are an Evolution of Trolls who stayed to close to the Sunwell i think
[3:15:42] TyndiVelspaz: sooo the chances of us getting Gnome Druids increases with that as the next expansion?!
[3:15:56] Smokebear: they need to do something about story cohesiveness cause when leveling a new character all the expansions are so jumbled no one knows what's really going on or how things got to the way they are
[3:15:57] insaneinthebrain3: LUL PogChamp
[3:16:04] lastdeo: the ulduar globe map says there is not D': (but lore can change)
[3:16:27] Kisswani: to stop the manipulation of Sargeras maybe ?
[3:16:30] Smokebear: Dadgar tries to bring us back home after victory and mis calculates the time coordinates
[3:16:31] TheRiwen: just remove zolval a useless boss
[3:16:55] rimurs: maybe when sargeras realiced he's been played by zoval he will be on our side
[3:17:01] Maruika: !OONDASTA
[3:17:01] Moobot: @Maruika 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[3:17:03] Neyo59: do you farm Rukhmar ?
[3:17:09] dalaraz: they ahve teased a connection to zuvaal and elune too so something to come from there
[3:17:20] Kisswani: @rimurs yeah that's what I would think as well
[3:17:22] Korupcija_: rukhmar next week Kappa
[3:17:24] Smokebear: zovaal IS elune @dalaraz
[3:17:28] Masqerader: @Towelliee i hadn't open Isle of Thunder scenario opening that was why it was fucked up
[3:17:43] Aervyper: you finnally get the T rex?
[3:17:44] reggiepowa: would you get some of these mounts in bmah
[3:17:46] chrslp: How was the Matrix?

[3:18:26] spiritXC: maybe azeroth is just super tasty
[3:18:36] SpoofAvatar: azeroth is moist
[3:18:41] dalaraz: @Smokebear not a chance :p
[3:18:44] PadidinJones: @Towelliee maybe he doesnt want to destroy it. Could be he has hots for Azeroth
[3:19:03] Intrus18: @Towelliee  Are you done with new world or just taking a break? i went back after the merge, been fun.
[3:19:05] Kisswani: Clap
[3:19:06] HDrx: true
[3:19:15] Kelticlore: Illidan sis nothing wrong
[3:19:18] xXSiebzehnXx: The real hero
[3:19:29] Kelticlore: 8DID
[3:19:31] Smokebear: zovaal allows us to go back home but he mishears us say Azeroth and sends us to the outerspace world of Azermoth
[3:19:36] swankytygerr: He senses a flaw in the universe, but it turns out he's the flaw...
[3:19:38] TyndiVelspaz: Zovaal is just a scolded Gothic teenager wanting to be a dick for getting in trouble

[3:19:55] Korupcija_: KEKW
[3:19:59] dalaraz: waht if zovval is nzoth and we are in an illution,scammed
[3:20:02] Smokebear: blizz is def writing this expansion lore for the lulz
[3:20:05] Cntrl11120: he doesnt want to destroy, he wants to capture a titan soul (he is working WITH sargeras but he wants to control one) so wants to change azeroth like he did anduin so the sword will become a rune weapon
[3:20:06] DragonofWolves: all I know is that if blizzard pulls an celestial from eternals I'm going to lose it. not that I didn't like eternals but yeah.
[3:20:06] DigitalChill: when did Oon drop
[3:20:06] jeflag: hes doing it for social experiment
[3:20:09] Kisswani: nobbel is not big on SL story unfortunately
[3:20:10] Rudric_Ice: everyone wants that asseroth
[3:20:18] arlog111: gz on the Oon mount drop
[3:20:19] Aquadriel: but zoval machinated all events we know since wc3 bro, he is the mastermind behind the legion and LK and azshara, and all bro.
[3:20:20] Masqerader: no more life and death, but doesn't her get his power from the dead being sent to the maw? so he's cucking himself?
[3:20:23] ispyyro: Begs the question of who is good and who is bad out of Horde and Alliance

[3:20:57] DragonofWolves: he's right though the old lore and modern lore are hard to connect
[3:20:59] buddybeerbruh: Its a bad story Blizzard doesnt know wtf they doing
[3:21:07] szble: yeah they can write whatever they want at this point
[3:21:16] xXSiebzehnXx: Yeah, supposed to go back and have everyone be like “Oh sorry we knew about all this shit and didn’t tell you, whoopsy”

[3:21:47] Firedexx: Firedexx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 104 months! 
[3:21:55] GrubsteakMcGilicuty: argus?
[3:22:04] freshlife: Soon they will reveal that the mole-potato people hiding underground has been mind controlling the gods all along
[3:22:07] Kelticlore: Maybe hes lonely and wants someone
[3:22:08] captivated_gg: she is hot
[3:22:10] xXSiebzehnXx: Did Azeroth have the only Lich King?
[3:22:12] Masqerader: maybe he needs a gf
[3:22:13] Smokebear: azeroth's world soul was zovaal's ex gf
[3:22:19] DragonofWolves: it's like you can't connect old lore to new modern lore without writing stuff to have it make sense. and SL lore does make sense-ish but at the same time it doesn't
[3:22:21] Masqerader: he lonely 10000 years locked away and no booty
[3:22:22] captivated_gg: she is hot and he got nipples
[3:22:25] Kisswani: isn't Azeroth like the most powerful world soul ?
[3:22:28] Cntrl11120: Azeroth has retained the corruption of the void lords so he wants the power of resistance , while Argus was semi destroyed by the corruption.
[3:22:39] Aquadriel: @Towelliee to my undersdanting everyone wants azeroth soul to corrupt it, even the voidlords. that's why sargeras wanted to destroy it.
[3:22:42] Reckless_Monk: Well they did hinted that Azeroth is sleeping and she dreams this whole excistance.
[3:22:44] xXSiebzehnXx: @kisswani I think it’s the only one left intact
[3:22:48] dalaraz: i bet azeroth is an eternal one,zovaal banished her then he got prisoned
[3:22:50] Reckless_Monk: Kill her and everything ends
[3:22:55] Kisswani: ah could be yeah
[3:23:03] buddybeerbruh: Is Zulval performing the natural obligations ? @Towelliee
[3:23:03] Kelticlore: we dont know how many there are
[3:23:17] Masqerader: what?
[3:23:18] Aquadriel: WAYTOODANK
[3:23:25] Masqerader: i want that weed logic
[3:23:33] Kelticlore: we dont know how many World souls are left
[3:23:49] Smokebear: azeroth is actually zovaal's soul and he needs it back to be the good jailer again
[3:23:50] szble: i wouldnt be surprised if there was more
[3:23:57] dranet11: must be because of the woons
[3:23:59] Sarocus: He might just need Azeroth as a power source
[3:24:04] xXSiebzehnXx: Well, Azeroth was plan A, this is plan B
[3:24:06] Voldreka: @Towelliee If I remember correct, Sargarus was the most powerful titan before the discovery of our World Soul.
[3:24:11] rimurs: he wants to use the azeroth's titan soul as a battery for rerwitting the rules of the universe
[3:24:12] buddybeerbruh: Maybe Ali G could shed some light on wow lore
[3:24:14] LizzardLIVE: when do you think the new expansion will come out?
[3:24:17] Aquadriel: @Towelliee to my undersdanting everyone wants azeroth soul to corrupt it, even the voidlords. that's why sargeras wanted to destroy it.
[3:24:32] TakeThatBack: i know nothing of wow lore ~ ;x
[3:24:33] Masqerader: its like the plot to ghostbusters 2.  Zooval needs a source, and lil azeroth must be it... and we're the only ones who can stop it
[3:24:33] dalaraz: problem is,we dont know why zovaal was jailed in the first place so its kinda meh story
[3:24:35] DragonofWolves: exactly, it made sense kind of in the beginning but that Torghast Cinematic just make you go WTF?
[3:24:38] GrubsteakMcGilicuty: azeroths world soul is strong enough to withstand the corruption of the void lords?
[3:24:41] Kelticlore: then wouldnt the Titan Pantheon be strong enough
[3:24:47] Reckless_Monk: Yeah just like Argus literally fueled the Legion
[3:24:47] Kisswani: see , as bad as parts of the story is , I love this kind of speculation
[3:24:51] Korupcija_: sofo
[3:24:55] Elementlolz1: what do you think will happen with the world of Azeroth awoke
[3:24:57] xXSiebzehnXx: @takethatback stay a while and listen lol
[3:25:06] Superminty: Can we get a simple problem in 10.0? Like tracking down corrupt citizens in Elwynn forest etc.
[3:25:06] Elementlolz1: if*
[3:25:20] Aquadriel: sofo deez nuts KEKW
[3:25:25] rimurs: the story with zoval and the cosmic energies is not bad actually i think, is just sylvanas
[3:25:35] Reckless_Monk: NOOOOOOOO
[3:25:37] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:25:41] CodeMasterr: LUL
[3:25:47] dranet11: the first non binary pear titan

[3:25:52] dalaraz: i wanna know,why we dont ask primus,wth happened back then
[3:25:52] 3663Sharad: The first queer (?) Titan LUL
[3:25:53] xXSiebzehnXx: Floating rocks
[3:25:57] captivated_gg: If she is not hot, I'll defo quit!
[3:25:57] Masqerader: i assume highmountain and neverest are her bobs
[3:25:59] DigitalChill: hell yes

[3:26:05] DragonofWolves: so @towelliee what do you think of the dragon isles being the next xpac because of that dragon mount bundle on the store
[3:26:12] Kisswani: we can't go back in story scale now
[3:26:21] motorboatingpro: I guarantee she'll be a pre-alpha female troll model.
[3:26:41] dalaraz: why dont we just asked,hey covenants what happened with the jailer
[3:26:52] Kisswani: just looking for a power socket KEKW
[3:26:52] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee it does sound funny, but I think the game could stand with a more localized, restoration of azeroth kind of expansion... with build up to the next expac
[3:26:59] Masqerader: Watch it turn out like Indian Jones, he opens up the ark and kills himself
[3:27:31] Nowack_hs: He actually cancels the whole story line so we have to do it all again
[3:27:35] chrslp: I just cant imagine Blizz doing something that big in a reasonable amount of time with how long these content patches have taken LUL
[3:27:38] captivated_gg: But how can you wake someone up that is comfortably sleeping with a hughe ass sword in her body?^^
[3:28:01] Masqerader: back when elves were still trolls
[3:28:03] DragonofWolves: I mean for all we know, we could be returning to a AU Azeroth just like we did with AU Draenor
[3:28:08] Djfarmville: Boots on the ground wow 10.0 Kappa
[3:28:13] dalaraz: can you go to primus asap and asked why he became the jailer please :) @Towelliee
[3:28:21] cuddlytoxic: new expansion reveals UE5 lol
[3:28:22] DragonofWolves: because time travel
[3:28:32] smashwow: eeeeeh we thought they could do a quick release with Shadowlands. that didn't work out
[3:28:54] Masqerader: i love how all 4 of them stripped him of his powers and now are like... ya well.
[3:28:58] Kisswani: Argus fucked the Arbiter
[3:28:58] dranet11: didnt they say when they cancelled blizzconline that they would still have previews of upcoming content?
[3:29:13] dalaraz: argus the titan right ?
[3:29:14] Neyo59: the big red thing
[3:29:18] smashwow: argus has been a theory for awhile for the fuckup
[3:29:23] DragonofWolves: wait say what?
[3:29:30] TheRiwen: II will play 9.2 when it comes out.
[3:29:45] Aquadriel: SL story thaught me that i can be a useless person and still aspire to be the most important being (pelagos into arbiter) lmao
[3:30:11] Kisswani: yeah looking good
[3:30:12] smashwow: yeah that pelagos thing is just wtf
[3:30:16] DragonofWolves: @aquadriel yeah I didn't agree with that choice either.

[3:30:57] Elementlolz1: ouch
[3:31:05] smashwow: they might have to go to rumblr instead of youtube @Towelliee  Kappa
[3:31:08] dranet11: their loss
[3:31:10] Reckless_Monk: riot should be banned like that too
[3:31:14] TakeThatBack: I really want to go to blizzcon again =(
[3:31:15] chrslp: well aint that the punishment for their own actions
[3:31:17] nielefs: And still bobby isnt going away
[3:31:21] Masqerader: Meh, its not like these gaming companies need these events so
[3:31:21] reggiepowa: except riot
[3:31:26] Sarocus: Dicks being treated like dicks
[3:31:33] Kelticlore: is blocking Activision with that
[3:31:40] DragonofWolves: well Ubisoft hasn't announced a new Assassin's Creed so

[3:32:02] Korupcija_: why can't they just act human :/
[3:32:14] chrslp: Email announcement KEKW
[3:32:35] DragonofWolves: welp at least we don't need to see whatever COD game comes out. I'm honestly getting tired of the yearly releases
[3:32:38] cuddlytoxic: make wow great again
[3:32:47] Kelticlore: what would they do if you tube blocks them
[3:32:55] Cosbert: YouTube is such a larger platform, to be fair.
[3:32:59] dranet11: 9.2 was
[3:33:11] Aquadriel: only thing in twitch is classic pvp
[3:33:16] reggiepowa: they are under contract though right?
[3:33:35] itsly0n: mdi is so boring compare to great push
[3:33:39] Masqerader: blah nm thought it was horde
[3:33:43] dalaraz: its very boring to watch anyway
[3:33:50] TheRiwen: I just like 10.0. Not even exsited for 9.2
[3:33:54] ralecgos: yeah competitive gaming is very twitch oriented
[3:33:54] Korupcija_: on youtube you need to specificly look for it, on twitch you can stumble upon it

[3:34:09] Masqerader: viewers matter not, they got paid
[3:34:16] SmokedHog: twitch has the community of wow streamers. can't think of any wow streamers on youtube
[3:34:17] Gingerprimer: @Kisswani I am so annoyed by ppl saying that Sylvans is on the road to some kind of a redemption arc
[3:34:23] Gingerprimer: @luckfore nah that was TGP
[3:34:24] Kisswani: @luckfore that was the great push
[3:34:24] dranet11: i think the great push gets more viewers than MDI anyway
[3:34:35] dalaraz: is a youtube problem,or it is boring content
[3:34:41] flebbooo: But its weird cause they had the The great push on twitch
[3:34:42] Aquadriel: @Towelliee i think is just that people still don't conceive Youtube as a live streaming thing, specially for gaming.

[3:35:24] Masqerader: I stream on Mixer, cause like Shroud said it will be bigger than twitch in 5 years
[3:35:28] SmokedHog: one or two, compared to tons of entire mythic guilds on twitch
[3:35:32] Gingerprimer: @TheRiwen except the fact the latest cinematic is far from a reedemption arch
[3:35:33] Masqerader: OH WAIT
[3:35:36] Noiseeater: you mean meta
[3:35:40] spankymcpie: amazon is gonna buy onlyfans and merge it with twitch

[3:42:03] scassel85: Youtube streaming UI is hot garbage
[3:42:14] MikeOG: @Towelliee you are twitch I know you from 2012 you are the OG of twitch
[3:42:17] Reckless_Monk: @Towelliee They do, valkyrae was talking about how she was down in hours
[3:42:20] SmokedHog: that would suck for the WF race
[3:42:24] Kisswani: how is the ad situation on youtube ? as annoying as it can be on twitch ?

[3:42:54] Gibsonex937: YouTube is trying to get more viewers. If they were as popular as twitch the contracts would change
[3:43:14] Gingerprimer: They have contracts but they are way lower than Twitch contracts
[3:43:23] DragonofWolves: @kromede there was like legit silence after that statement

[3:47:15] SmokedHog: then you just gotta hope your financial advisor is managing your money properly
[3:47:34] MikeOG: The problem with NFT is that you can buy your own NFT for a high value and then sell it for a fraction of it and make bank
[3:47:39] Sollice: @finnad Explain why I want to put money in a completely volatile market. If money crashed what would crypto do for me?
[3:47:50] finnad: NFTs will be the backbone of gaming and play2earn, it's only just beginning

[5:25:40] Nillus: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP @hybridsteve
[5:25:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: sargeras is going to show up and reclaim it
[5:25:51] Mitune: that is actually sad to think about and hear
[5:25:53] Wcvechten: How would you realistically remove something of that size without reopening the woonz
[5:25:57] Aidler: it’s just a sword towSmile
[5:26:03] Autoexeq: Which MoP mounts you got left @Towelliee
[5:26:06] Alaquane: Azeroth is going through a phase right now. she loves her new piercing
[5:26:07] Teldrin89: I don't know... I think they might resolve this sword with end of SL
[5:26:08] Tigris002: I mean look how long it took them to fix SW after deathwing lol
[5:26:45] Teldrin89: on SW... too many contractors xd
[5:26:47] pavepawns: end cinematic is gonna be azeroth comes and stabs the jailor
[5:26:50] akia03: jailor uses it in his last phase
[5:26:52] pavepawns: with the sword
[5:26:53] RealSolaroid: We go to the dragon isles and we meet people there that help us remove / repair the wound from the sword ezpz expansion tied together lol
[5:26:56] Mitune: Why does the Arbitor need anything? They are a robot essentially
[5:27:01] m3rk_zion: inb4 my original thought is true.... and Azeroth Wakes up taking Sargeras' sword as her own....
[5:27:33] HAMMERRAZOR: hey towelliee hey chat
[5:27:35] Autoexeq: inb4 Sargeras and Azeroth are brother and sister
[5:27:37] grootlock: towCringe towCringe towCringe towCringe towCringe
[5:27:46] ThaOriginalGamester: i've been waiting for them to finish that skyscraper in GTAV for 8 years! Keepo There's a new casino and Dr Dre is taking over the real estate market
[5:28:00] Autoexeq: ....and lovers
[5:28:04] testecklies: WTF did i just see KBATO!?!
[5:28:23] Freemzz: they are clones created by the first ones
[5:28:33] Dinokaze: I feel like the only way they can rescue WoW at this point is when we defeat the jailer he "wins" anyway and "remakes reality" or whatever and we go back to Azeroth, but it's so changed that they release WoW 2
[5:29:16] testecklies: more than likely we get to fiight the void dudes
[5:29:30] Mitune: We do need a hard reset of some kind. Reset and refocus the story and the drive of the game
[5:29:45] KombatWombat07: @Dinokaze I'm praying the Jailor wins at the end of SL, and WoW 2 emerges lol
[5:30:03] Dinokaze: With the burning legion defeated in Legion, we should have set our sights on the Void, but having another faction conflict and then SL was just stupid. Basically filler arcs
[5:30:45] zardistus: cohhJam cohhJam cohhJam cohhJam
[5:31:12] testecklies: but ii dont think it is known that the voids guys r the ones behind all the mess
[5:31:31] Aidler: maybe they actually try to use the PTR as content… no idea how that will help them in 2022 though
[5:31:44] Mitune: They better never use the word maw ever again LUL

[5:32:51] Suligane: ngl, realllllly love the robot voice

[5:43:18] SmokedHog: they don't innovate, yeah
[5:44:07] thiccsushi: I dont think they can make it to top 3 because FSY raids from 7pm to midnight compared to the other 3 who go at it all day

[5:45:01] Thoreya: ^
[5:45:09] Allexi88: Dossou is in Limit. He has stopped raiding 3 or 4 times. Its just what he does
[5:45:10] Tyrammus84: Teaser trailer for Doctor strange just came out looks nuts

[5:50:11] Mitune: dunno why
[5:50:14] Watershots: Lula is amazing, Imagine getting high with her :)
[5:50:15] thiccsushi: Has the ending been spoiled yet or do we still not know at what timeline we will be back in azeroth?
[5:50:56] FiddleShticts: Steam Winter Sale today
[5:51:02] Alaquane: Jebaited

[5:51:27] Korupcija_: I loved argus, visually so good
[5:51:32] thiccsushi: Argus was a good fight
[5:51:54] Korupcija_: the whole raid was so fun
[5:52:06] denflup: i can still hear amanthul's voice saying "Aggramar!!!"
[5:52:07] thiccsushi: I liked all the fights execpt ionar
[5:52:16] vivotec: what is this ? mage tower ?
[5:52:21] Rudric_Ice: I loved the Imonar fight
[5:52:39] Wcvechten: I think he was that red light that yeeted into the Arbiter which caused her to go Inactive
[5:52:43] Alaquane: @vivotec 9.2 ptr story testing
[5:52:47] vivotec: <--- have not played wow on along time
[5:52:47] pavepawns: when you killed argus he became a nuke hitting arbiter
[5:53:04] Teldrin89: he's supposably destroyed arbiter
[5:53:27] Frankzor_19: OH HOLY SHIT, THE RED SHARD IN OPENEING SCENE WAS ARGUS
[5:53:30] riyochi991: it's in the cinematic where the arbiter goes to sleep
[5:53:56] Frankzor_19: The opening scene of the entire expac, where the arbiter gets hit buy it and dies
[5:53:57] smashwow: that's the theory
[5:53:57] FiddleShticts: Towelliee, you think it's too late for people who've never played WOW to start playing now?
[5:54:02] Paxinoro: but why is the echo of argus here?
[5:54:04] Teldrin89: oribos - when they shown what happened
[5:54:14] Alaquane: this guy is clearly blue
[5:54:22] Teldrin89: we speculated before that it was denathrius (bc red)
[5:54:26] Wcvechten: His mythic phase is alot of red
[5:54:30] Shoeboots: It is red. We all assumed it was read cause it was sent by Sire Denathrias but I guess it was actually Argus
[5:54:40] pavepawns: i can link cinematic if u want
[5:54:40] r0b928: @fiddleshticts it’s never too late, I come back and play now and then, I’m a little lost but I get the hang of it quickly and it’s super fun
[5:54:46] Buddhabutt79: !raid
[5:54:59] Mitune: ok was this actually the plan of the Dreadlords? To bring back this weak as thing?
[5:55:00] StraightErro: I think nobbel said the dreadlords helped feed Argus so much death energy, he was sent to shadowlands instead of titan afterlife, which messed things up royally
[5:55:16] Alaquane: we silenced the song of oblivion rooDerp
[5:55:43] r0b928: Who else is having tacos for lunch today!!??
[5:55:45] sifer007: SMOrc

[5:57:40] idenkaz_: KEKW eh
[5:57:43] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: KEKW
[5:57:44] Mitune: They really should not have let Pelagos have a personality at this point
[5:57:48] Alaquane: he got a glow up
[5:57:49] af2kk: jesus christ
[5:57:50] Rudric_Ice: LUL
[5:57:51] Frankzor_19: I'm ok with this.
[5:57:54] pavepawns: titans when they die go to their respective area. so it would the plane of order for argus. but because he was fueled and used as a constant respawn machine he became fuel with mortalility. the thing that leads him to the shadowlands. basically we killed so many demons we broke how his entire being was and worked and with that we broke his alignment
[5:57:57] Hayon5: he is really scarry
[5:58:05] af2kk: that doesnt look right
[5:58:13] dalaraz: pepelagos the arbiter ? why

[5:58:28] Secondbreakfasttt: @OrdinaryAdventurer lmao
[5:58:30] ThaOriginalGamester: we did it reddit
[5:58:41] StraightErro: Like Kiljaedan or Illidan, they are technically draenei and elf, when killed they should have gone to the shadowlands, but became so infused with fel, became a demon and resurrects in the Twisting Nether instead
[5:58:51] idenkaz_: towNot
[5:58:58] Jonrain: so what happens to his soulbind for the Kyrian . do we get stronger LOL .
[5:59:18] zaffiehtv: soooo you get new shit as a kyrian now when you chose the arbiter pelegos as a soulbind? xD
[5:59:30] captivate7: LOL
[5:59:47] Shoeboots: I dunno. Being the arbiter seems like a lot of work.
[5:59:50] captivate7: who's the new soulbind
[5:59:50] Aidler: no you just loos one soulbind… lol
[5:59:59] im_n0t_jezus: TRUE
[6:00:11] thiccsushi: Too bad they abandoned soulbinds
[6:00:18] Alaquane: she got passed over for a promotion and this new hire is now her boss
[6:00:21] Djfarmville: Having an arbiter as a soulbind sounds op
[6:00:23] Korupcija_: my immersion
[6:00:31] pavepawns: pelagos final conduit = you are a vessel of death and can never die yourself as long as pelagos lives Kappa
[6:00:31] rockthefries: he a big guy now he aint got time for soulbinds

[6:02:45] Wcvechten: Not 1, but 2 Swords into Azeroth!
[6:02:47] Nevindaz: Illidan :)
[6:02:50] Frankzor_19: Maybe he does a "Thanos Snap"
[6:02:51] rohdey: he'll time stone vision Kappa
[6:03:03] thiccsushi: I hope we lose then get thrown in another timeline somehow and become a regular old adventurer again
[6:03:06] Mitune: Hell I would have taken illidan over Pelagos for the Arbitor and that makes even less sense
[6:03:13] Teldrin89: sylv trial??
[6:03:20] Kisswani: Sylvanas tjusdgement ?
[6:03:21] Wcvechten: They're going to make the Jailer stand trail in Pandaria ofcourse
[6:03:23] Shoeboots: Fate of Slyvanas
[6:03:28] Armdel: Pelagos has been working for the jailer this whole time Kappa
[6:03:34] rockthefries: the achievement was called "Starting Over" so back to lvl 1 we go
[6:03:49] Frankzor_19: I think the jailer does something to entirely change reality fucking up the multiverse and totally re-arranging current system
[6:03:58] riyochi991: You want WoW 2.0
[6:03:58] jeflag: illidan as an arbiter will just send everyone to the maw
[6:04:00] lohfnarfalan: !oondasta

[6:04:15] Armdel: dare*
[6:04:19] Rudric_Ice: we need a different game for that towelliee
[6:04:21] Nevindaz: or maybe Sylvanas will do a final act with Anduin to defeat Jailer.. and she will be forgiven of her mistakes KEKW

[6:15:34] Tooshkit: @Dinokaze they had that huge time gap between 8.3 and shadowlands, did not help
[6:15:47] abracka_: they would never completely reset wow. if they ever rebuilt it on a new engine, it'd just be a new MMO at that point
[6:15:57] SmokedHog: find a way to make all old raids relevant and farmable content
[6:15:59] ChimmyNeutron: @Tooshkit This will be a longer gap between. They need it
[6:16:42] Tooshkit: a longer time gap than 10 months? not rly doable without everyone quitting lol
[6:17:01] Kriven: Just copped my matrix gfuel box using code towel
[6:17:08] ChimmyNeutron: @Tooshkit It's easily doable. They have the financial resources lol
[6:17:08] TheRealAxiom: 10.0 Oct...i know a guy haha
[6:17:10] Frankzor_19: LMAO that hunter mog
[6:17:11] dracullus: oh yeah cause everyone quit after WoD
[6:17:12] Zivs: Can't they announce it sooner? Shadowlands was announced same time as 8.3 was announced
[6:17:19] thiccsushi: no shot 10.0 in oct
[6:17:20] aekona: !oondasta
[6:17:21] Moobot: @aekona 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[6:17:34] SmokedHog: because everybody knows they can get that welfare gear
[6:17:40] elbinn: catch me with that full corruption set at the end of 8.3 but not being there the first 4 months it launched
[6:17:43] abracka_: if they announced that 10.0 is going to be delayed and just give us a "soonTM" i think that would give some faith for the player base
[6:17:48] aelendyl: I'm probably not even gonna play until 9.3.5
[6:17:50] crowe6485: they always announce the next expansion every other year at blizzcon
[6:17:52] iamviholt: Why will 10.0 come out in Q1 2023? With Shadowlands having a tier less than usual, don't blizzard have more development time for 10.0?
[6:17:58] Bernardo994: your crazy man thats why i love ya, your crazy man
[6:18:08] Zivs: @Zornaxx there won't be a 9.3
[6:18:21] Alaquane: towOny
[6:18:22] DeanoTV: no way they can do another 10+ month drought
[6:18:39] abracka_: toss out a 9.2.5 as a filler after like 6ish months of 9.2, 10.0 launch early winter/late fall 2022, even jan 2023
[6:18:47] Dinokaze: They could easily go with an 18 month drought if it means they have a release like Legion again, or better
[6:18:50] Janigiv: @Towelliee do u think the new lvl cap will be 70?
[6:18:54] Rexialiton: @SilkeySmooth what are you even on mate LUL
[6:18:54] elandura: remember they announced SL before officially releasing nzoth patch. sam can happen for 10.0
[6:19:03] abracka_: they have the ability to secure the top dawg spot again, they just need to execute it correctly
[6:19:04] Nebulizer87: if there isn't a new class im out
[6:19:04] Colt_Engineer: I think the Shadowlands droughts are the longest
[6:19:11] iamviholt: Why will 10.0 come out in Q1 2023? With Shadowlands having a tier less than usual, don't blizzard have more development time for 10.0?
[6:19:12] TheUnknowing: you guys gotta realize, we've only really been in SL for a year, I know it feels much longer but 2023 does make sense for 10,0
[6:19:13] DeanoTV: we've already had droughts this expac
[6:19:15] Armdel: this is like 3 droughts in one expansion though
[6:19:15] Janigiv: dragon isles :)
[6:19:21] jeflag: i have a tshirt that says 'i survived WoD'
[6:19:27] DeanoTV: they cant do another long drought
[6:19:27] abracka_: god no, do not make an entire expansion on the dragon isles please
[6:19:32] TheRealAxiom: 10.0 in Oct, trust me. I know a guy
[6:19:36] ProfessorChaoos: me and all the bois plan on going back once a new expac drops
[6:19:37] Anneris1: I think someone from blizzard already said we are coming back to Azeroth
[6:19:43] crowe6485: wow had an entire patch where it was just a selfie cam
[6:19:48] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @iamviholt (warning)
[6:19:49] Tooshkit: half of the expansions were another planet or reality :P
[6:19:52] cefeon: 2025 looks good for 10.0 - round year for round patch version :D
[6:20:03] DeanoTV: we've already had droughts this expac
[6:20:12] smashwow: can they yes. will less people come back yes. but will wow be around also yes
[6:20:13] abracka_: classic WotLK can even come out mid 2022 to keep people talking/playing wow, gives them even more time
[6:20:14] rockthefries: what do you mean you people?
[6:20:17] Frankzor_19: @Towelliee My goal is to be the raid leader for my nursing homes Mythic team
[6:20:19] babytrebuchet: Im just waiting on the LK classic servers
[6:20:24] Rexialiton: cause they hate wow and wanna see wow do bad cause of streamers says so KEKW
[6:20:29] Kriven: we gonna be watching towel in vr 2050 WOW IS GONNA DIE

[6:20:35] Kisswani: KEKW
[6:20:36] Janigiv: @Towelliee do u think the new lvl cap will be 70?
[6:20:38] dianthusnemo: we'¨ll be here :D
[6:20:38] drewetling: 18.0 hype
[6:20:50] Frankzor_19: Lol
[6:20:55] Janigiv: gimme cata classic
[6:20:59] Almostwes: its def on the steep decline, no matter how you cut it
[6:21:01] jaypee522: 15 grandkids lol you think we have sex
[6:21:01] dracullus: my guild raided last 50 years but in 36.2 we all quit, what a shitty expansion
[6:21:09] cefeon: Tell me just one thing, will Anduin have kids in 18.0?
[6:21:14] Bernardo994: t im gonna come back once they pull there head out of thier ass

[6:21:22] pereadin: wrath was all aboutt the lore and ToGC armor set <3
[6:21:24] iamviholt: Question: Why do you think 10.0 will come out in Q1 2023? With Shadowlands having a tier less than usual, don't blizzard have more development time for 10.0?
[6:21:26] ProfessorChaoos: people will think the controversy will keep wow dead, while nike and apple hit trillion of dollars with huge controversy
[6:21:27] Khoulwhip: @cendriii there are lot of people complaining about WoW, but they keep holding on to every bit of news to justify returning.  They're addicted, and Blizz knows it.
[6:22:10] Vch001: kids  WITH?
[6:22:16] Frankzor_19: I think Anduin is gay. Like actually. Would be cool to see an LGBT main character
[6:22:22] Jango_: the shareholders care if it effects the bottom line
[6:22:26] Zivs: @iamviholt they have had way more issues this year, you can't compare BFA/Legion dev to Shadowlands dev. Just look at the time between patches
[6:22:46] Vch001: Actually, the only person I could see marrying Aunduin is Bolvar's daughter

[6:23:26] Zivs: @ProfessorChaoos yes that was my point

[6:23:27] Rexialiton: if blizzard needs time to make an expac fucking great, ey give them all the time they need

[6:31:26] danoh_64: i can see 2 more
[6:31:44] rockthefries: the 2nd matrix is considered the hornier one
[6:31:48] PhatyBoy: Is spiderman on there as well?
[6:32:01] mitchumtx: @PhatyBoy Exclusive to theatres
[6:32:01] r0b928: Are all 4 matrix movies on HBO?

[6:32:31] jxxpn: Sorry, HBO MAX isn’t available in your region yet.
[6:32:36] feherlofia123: matrix 2 is just matrix on steroids with lots of action, while M3 is like wrapping up the story , but theres more meaningful story behind it than the second
[6:32:55] AinaTan3: I remember coming out of the theater after watching the original Matrix, was completely blown away
[6:32:59] r0b928: That’s probably what I will do
[6:33:05] Aidler: @epicadev VPN?
[6:33:07] TheUnknowing: i dont have a theater near me so cant see spiderman til it comes out online somewhere lol
[6:33:08] aelendyl: Matrix 1: Virus arises to fight the chosen one Matrix 2: Virus spreads in the Matrix Matrix 3: Virus spreads beyond the Matrix
[6:33:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: first time i saw the matrix my teacher was showing it in high school and we only got to see the first part. my mind was blown and I rushed to the video store after school to rent it
[6:33:33] feherlofia123: you are the sum of an unsolved equation
[6:33:39] SmokedHog: got chills when neo controlled the machines outside the matrix
[6:33:56] r0b928: I hope since Spider-Man made so much money in theaters already they will release it sooner to stream
[6:34:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: vpn it
[6:34:09] rockthefries: the 2008 MTV parody architect is my favourite

[6:39:18] portend: Yeah shortly after Revolutions Matrix Online was introduced and continued the story
[6:39:22] seanb4games: the controls were super wonky, doing one thing would often do another thing entirely and it was hard to differentiate
[6:39:35] QuigsTV: @Towelliee I just got the beryl shardhide mount in wow. I juyst need the archavist codex paragon mount and then i never have to  do korthia again
[6:39:43] JuppDuke: matrix reloaded i think it was named was pretty good. for ps2
[6:39:44] Gingerprimer: Yeha the Matrix online game is canon right?
[6:39:58] portend: Enter the Matrix was for PS2
[6:40:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: The service was officially shut down at 00:00 August 1, 2009; at the time, it had fewer than 500 active players  it lasted over 4 years somehow

[6:41:18] SmokedHog: all 500 of them owned neo trenchcoats
[6:41:23] JuppDuke: @portend i enjoyd that one atleast. but sure, iwas a kid back then lol
[6:41:25] Pigbottom: I think matrix online could have survived if it endured till the free to play era
[6:41:31] fanta_2k: @Towelliee new matrix ? looks more like a new john wick :D
[6:41:41] Dinokaze: That's like The Secret World MMO, that game was dope but end game systems were severely lacking and PVP was rough. It's somehow still going after 10 years
[6:42:07] Mr_Pennywise_: :(
