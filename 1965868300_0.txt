[2:39:41] Vileguy: does your addon pick the flight path for you?
[2:39:54] QinlingP: its a close call for you aswell
[2:39:55] Morrkills: lol you died and still ahead of cyr O.O
[2:39:58] BatmanHellbent: Have you considered setting up mouseover decurse? clique is a great addon for it
[2:40:25] QtPaj: @Vileguy it does, with that addon you can basically turn off  your brain because it does all the planning for you lol
[2:40:28] cocococomango: Have you got auto loot on now Cobalt?
[2:40:29] Vileguy: as long as you have party/raid frames, don't need another addon for mouseover, macros work great

[2:41:18] SheepsAholy: I love gummies, but I hate how they make your hands smell after
[2:41:33] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: Gnomer is a death trap
[2:41:47] andrewlol69: im down to die in gnomer
[2:41:49] Koroberry: @SheepsAholy eat with chopsticks! or just pour them in your mouth directly out the bag! :D
[2:41:50] andrewlol69: f it
[2:41:59] Kinghorn: just dont go up middle and it is fine
[2:42:05] andrewlol69: mfer one wrong pull we all dead
[2:42:07] Kinghorn: everyone who dies goes up mid
[2:42:09] BatmanHellbent: it's very easy to pull an entire hallway
[2:42:10] Koroberry: gnomer is easy, just hug the wall in the last bit and it's fine
[2:42:13] TobiOnar: gnomer is fine, just need to turn your brain back on for an hour
[2:42:15] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: Bc 1 bad move can aggro half the dungeon
[2:42:17] SheepsAholy: they be scared of that narrow hallway and pulling the entire hall
[2:42:20] BatmanHellbent: all you need is one idiot
[2:42:26] cocococomango: @CobaltStreak one quest requires you to enter the very entrance of gnomer - but not go into the portal - kill a single mob then leave. People always skip it but you can do it in a duo to prepare.
[2:42:28] Kinghorn: just dont invite idiots
[2:42:50] Koroberry: @Kinghorn impossible LuL
[2:43:09] smallbeautifulcat: beterDrum
[2:43:27] Captain19Planet: you're so much taller than last time
[2:43:31] cocococomango: Thats why im saying one of them you should do the first part before the run, as the whole group likely wont want to get in - then leave then come back to do it.
[2:44:37] BatmanHellbent: do you ahve shatter?
[2:45:36] BatmanHellbent: nova coc is so fun with shatter
[2:45:43] TobiOnar: it's hard and it's core
[2:46:01] Captain19Planet: it's very tempting
[2:46:05] Captain19Planet: having a lot of fun on retail still
[2:46:23] Tabun_Time: gnomer is just hard cuz it has the most 1shots i think
[2:46:23] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: It's chill until you pull 5 mons and 1 of them roots or frostbolts
[2:46:37] Captain19Planet: @Tabun_Time dungeons in general just sound wicked scary lol
[2:46:42] Morrkills: imagine playing the hardcore addon before hc wow classic came out.
[2:47:00] Rakiller1: funny dark iron mines
[2:47:04] Vileguy: gnomer is also huge and people skip parts which makes it impossible to run out
[2:47:05] Tabun_Time: well like the mines/traps
[2:47:09] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: I can prob go at 34
[2:47:13] Tabun_Time: the pet pulls
[2:47:24] Tabun_Time: the elevator and falls
[2:47:28] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: Dont want to nerf the xp
[2:47:32] Captain19Planet: for real, and it's not just gnomer a whole pile of dungeons are just absolutely massive @Vileguy
[2:47:58] Vileguy: I'm scared to do any dungeon in hardcore LUL
[2:48:25] Tabun_Time: is there a boss that does a knock back also ? i forget
[2:48:27] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: @vileguy I pretty much did them all. Had competent tanks tho
[2:48:54] Vileguy: I'll grind without quests if the place is right

[2:49:13] Vileguy: duskwood has some nice stuff to grind
[2:49:25] Captain19Planet: yeah CC being real again sounds nice, actually using your traps and saps and polymorphs to effect
[2:49:46] DarkMeos: Joel
[2:49:58] Vileguy: I think doing dungeons with CC is way more fun than just aoeing everything, one thing I didn't like about how retail progressed
[2:50:10] Captain19Planet: yeah mythic+ is a very weird play culture
