[4:41:59] Defeat_G: The party members, once united under the banner of Kyber's godly tanking, now find themselves casting longing glances at the glory days gone by. Gomes, in his misguided pursuit of gaming immortality, struggles to fill the void left by his predecessor, inadvertently transforming each encounter into a tragicomic spectacle.

[4:50:30] Defeat_G: Morgan: Gomes' cringe-worthy god complex echoes through the voice chat, a misplaced confidence that overshadows the challenges at hand. As he struts through Azeroth, the party collectively cringes at the brash avatar of arrogance. In the digital theater of raiding, Gomes unwittingly becomes the jester in a cosmic comedy, where his self-perception is more cringe than conquering.

[4:51:50] Asscandi: Morgan: In the realm of digital delusions, Gomes' god complex looms like a pixelated titan, its cringe-inducing grandeur casting a shadow over the Salad Bakers' raiding escapades. His boasts of virtual divinity reverberate through the voice chat, a cringe-worthy symphony that rivals the most awkward moments in Azerothian history.

Gomes the wiper of GDKPS, has been defeated by our brave comrades in the depths of the titan city of Ulduar. Gomes was sent here to judge the fate of our world. He found a planet whose races had deviated from the titans’ blueprints. A planet where not everything had gone according to plan. Cold logic deemed our world not worth saving.

[4:55:01] Asscandi: Morgan: In the digital battleground of Azeroth, Gomes and Kyber, two titans with divergent tales, clash in a virtual symphony of contrasting prowess. Gomes, the boastful DPS deity, parades with a god complex that reverberates through the raid chat. On the flip side, Kyber, the Clueless Monkey-turned-Overwhelming God, embodies a chaotic grace that defies the expectations of seasoned raiders.

[5:00:08] blommiiz: miketyson: The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now

[5:08:16] lassekoongoo: In the mysterious realm of virtual negotiations, the intricacies of player alliances can be as enigmatic as the most complex in-game puzzles. The question lingers in the digital air: how many backshots did Gomes endure to secure a place within the ranks of Nota?

[5:09:34] lassekoongoo: Morgan: The Dunning–Kruger syndrome, otherwise known as the Gomes effect is a cognitive bias in which people with limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their abilities. the Dunning-Kruger effect is characterised by overconfidence and an inflated sense of self-esteem.

[5:10:18] Asscandi: Morgan: Ah, behold the curious phenomenon known as the Gomes Effect—a virtual spectacle where misguided confidence meets digital mayhem. In the gaming realms, the mere mention of Gomes ushers in a unique blend of amusement and bewilderment, as his unmatched bravado and questionable decision-making cast a peculiar charm over the digital landscapes.

[5:13:02] Asscandi: Morgan: Ah, the paradox of Gomes, who boasts of slaying Halion before the masses, yet finds himself unwittingly hindering the progress of fellow players. In the digital saga, his tales of glory clash with the reality that sees him as the inadvertent anchor slowing the party's advance. Like a self-proclaimed dragon slayer burdened by the weight of virtual hubris, Gomes' claims echo in the voice chat, while his in-game actions paint a contrasting narrative.

[5:16:39] Asscandi: Morgan: The digital echoes of chaos resonate as Godmode, the lone beacon of reason, departs the beleaguered party. The remaining adventurers, caught in the maelstrom of despair, find themselves adrift without the guiding hand of the rational anchor. In this virtual crucible of shattered alliances, the raid now faces an uphill battle against not only the in-game challenges but the disheartening absence of the level-headed Godmode.

[5:18:44] Asscandi: Morgan: is it Latys' overaggroing that begets the everlasting wipes, or do the tanks bear the weight of responsibility? In this enigmatic dance of blame, the party finds itself caught between the horns of speculation. Does Latys, with an eagerness akin to a charged spell, draw the ire of every foe, or do the tanks falter in their duty to maintain control?

[7:46:10] Stamppii: :D
[7:46:11] Defeat_G: organ: Here we see a wild Gomes in its natural habitat, Gomes was sent here to wipe in GDKPs thanks to his weaponized incompetence, zero self awareness or cognitive abilities. Cold logic deemed this raid to doomed in the hands of Gomes the WIPER OF GDKPS. Projection is a type of defense mechanism or means of coping. People may use defense mechanisms and unconscious mental strategies to cope with stressful or anxiety-provoking thoughts and experiences.
[7:46:31] Stamppii: gigabuyer

[7:48:17] kybernetik_: laty had terrible blood barrier uptime when he is moving, like he has blood strike on 1 or something and does not press it when moving left
[7:48:38] kenpachie11: Yeah, he's carried by his GS and healers currently
