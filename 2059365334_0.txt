[3:32:47] erkin0696: warrior yeah
[3:33:06] moisttowelette21: I think Rogues, Mages, and 90% of warriors
[3:33:08] erkin0696: leveling is hard only
[3:33:18] moisttowelette21: i think warriors did lack a bit of "solo" capability
[3:33:34] erkin0696: i mean if u have healer its best thing
[3:33:43] erkin0696: its hard compare to other classes lets say KEKW
[3:34:59] jimbology: druid in general was pretty bad, but resto had raid spots and feral was low to mid tier
[3:35:13] jimbology: feral kitty*
[3:35:14] MisterThatDude: Ferals are forced to powershift, boomkins go oom instantly, rdruid was the worst healer in classic andyou could only have one in a raid. and feral tanks were garbage to anything but physical dmg
[3:35:56] DesiHeat: batJAM
[3:36:04] Githir: ferla tanks were the best 5 man tanks in vanilla

[3:36:15] Renfuryy: its been bad for me for like 2 days
[3:36:18] Dynamics831: yeah iv had to refresh mutiiple times
[3:36:42] Jhova91: supposedly the sword is linked to a possible priest rune, thats the speculation
[3:36:58] Renfuryy: why do I have this debuff still from stv madge
[3:37:57] Renfuryy: I read it too, theres very little info, only a few people in comments guessing
[3:38:31] Jhova91: i read it on wowhead somewhere in the comments under the item info

[3:56:38] Renfuryy: 1 shot is 1 shot
[3:56:41] Dynamics831: it gets diluted and work hit as hard
[3:56:43] Renfuryy: more or less water, still 1 shot
[3:56:55] Dynamics831: wont*
[3:57:35] Renfuryy: it is a tiny amount but its highly concentrated, same amount of caffeine, 1 shot is 1 shot
[3:58:31] Jhova91: yeah cold brew does
[3:58:46] Zefior: thats what i take YEP madrinas

[4:16:55] Rhythmicx1: i said that flat whites have much less foam i believe
[4:16:57] erkin0696: flat means less i guess KEKW

[4:16:59] Fossabot: https://clips.twitch.tv/ColdSquarePlumPoooound-oqxkw42a9rLAG4pS
[4:17:02] canopener263: flat white is no foam
[4:17:13] ry4n2828: white coffee is the best
[4:17:14] canopener263: just a dash of milk on top
[4:17:19] Arriv003: "A flat white is a blend of micro-foamed milk poured over a single or double shot of espresso. This microfoam is steamed milk infused with air, to create a smooth and velvety texture and creamy taste"
[4:17:27] deftlyx: Less bubbles
[4:17:27] Arriv003: It's an Aussie thing
[4:17:43] erkin0696: ohhh thats why flat white.. makes sense LUL
[4:17:47] Todd686: Although the term "flat white" was used in the United Kingdom to describe a type of espresso-based drink in the 1960s, the modern flat white was developed in Australia and New Zealand.
[4:17:48] Todd686: Hmmm
[4:17:51] Zefior: Veri is living the classic life with his 56k internet connection ICANT
[4:17:56] Todd686: Although the term "flat white" was used in the United Kingdom to describe a type of espresso-based drink in the 1960s, the modern flat white was developed in Australia and New Zealand.
[4:18:04] Rhythmicx1: milk is milk and the foam is milk bubbles. think of it this way lol :D
[4:18:12] Renfuryy: worried
[4:18:20] Todd686: Although the term "flat white" was used in the United Kingdom to describe a type of espresso-based drink in the 1960s, the modern flat white was developed in Australia and New Zealand.

[4:18:37] Renfuryy: desi with 3 double shots per day: CatDriving ALIENALIENALIENALIENALIEN
[4:18:45] deftlyx: They steam the milk with less power so it doesnt create foam just heats the milk
[4:19:10] Rhythmicx1: my friend once had 10 espressos in one sitting and he felt dizzy
[4:19:41] Dynamics831: GETOUTTAHERE
[4:19:41] deftlyx: flat, no bubbles like a flat soda
[4:19:42] Todd686: worried
[4:19:52] erkin0696: KEKW ryan
[4:20:08] JohnsenTTV: Oh lol
[4:20:10] ry4n2828: no its a different roast of the beans more caffeine
[4:20:11] erkin0696: when i drink 2 espresso shots my heart goin crazy
[4:20:14] Rhythmicx1: dont know, he was being dumb and i told him that too lol
[4:20:22] erkin0696: they just invented in australia i guess
[4:20:23] deftlyx: they like flat stuff
[4:20:25] Pat15: he was doing the ER speed run
[4:20:30] Elijahss: @ry4n2828 like white tea?
[4:20:30] Arriv003: It became popular in Australia and NZ
[4:21:10] ry4n2828: @Elijahss maybe idk how white tea is made
[4:21:15] Todd686: i enjoy flat pancakes and flat floors, so maybe
[4:21:16] Dynamics831: make IT
[4:21:21] Dynamics831: keking
[4:21:22] Renfuryy: keking
[4:21:27] erkin0696: that was exactloy my head keking
[4:21:30] Arriv003: 2 shots? Desi gonna be bouncing off those pink walls LUL
[4:21:35] deftlyx: oh wait its called flat cause its less milk, so its got a flat layer of white stuff ontop
[4:21:40] Elijahss: @ry4n2828 i think it has to do with when they pick it
[4:21:45] Dynamics831: like 3-4
[4:22:12] Todd686: catCoffee
[4:22:14] Arriv003: 2 or 3 shots in the venti (I forget)
[4:22:22] deftlyx: i drink alot of coffee
[4:22:22] Renfuryy: google says both venti and grande have 2 shots
[4:22:39] Arriv003: It is definitely not 4, although you can ask for it (quad venti)
[4:22:46] Todd686: sugar... BAD... for you fuegoNotes
[4:22:47] ry4n2828: @Elijahss white coffee is just roast the bean half way through so the taste is more nutty and more caffeine
[4:22:50] Rhythmicx1: sugar messes up the coffee's flavor in my opinion
[4:22:54] Dynamics831: caffeine is good for the metabolism speeds it up NODDERS
[4:23:31] deftlyx: yeah i make cold brew too at home
[4:23:40] Brother17_: what server do you play on?
