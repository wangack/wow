[3:53:47] Grumpa_Waya: No, the basics of The Butterfly Effect is that what you do affects the world around you. The story of A Distant Thunder and The Butterfly Effect, as well as Flashpoint in DC comics.
[3:53:57] adsongaming: The butterfly effect is a term used in chaos theory to describe how small changes in one part of a system can have large effects on another part of the system.

[4:45:58] nyrhalahotep: In order to loot the Suffusion Crucible (The yellow shards) you need to find the right alter, which is marked with a yellow pin on your minimap. Unfortunately you gotta be faster than the rest of the players in the area, as only one person can use each alter.
[4:46:03] tangdill: jjust buy it
[4:46:12] nyrhalahotep: The smaller altars will say crucible when you right click them. The bigger, more ornate altar is the mold. It is also the one that summons the big forgemaster elite that gives the keys to open the chest.

[9:43:17] Taylor131313: we threw Mirko into 20s as tank and it just worked
[9:43:19] Aegis_2566: You do +15s with 487 ilvl
[9:43:19] Makkan780: 15s in bis gear is super easy
[9:43:20] Bloodmatch: Today worse cuz of arena matches?

[9:45:33] Daara87: I can heal if you want to dps
[9:45:39] GI__Jose: Aegis you go Healer
[9:45:43] Vossie1990: mirkos tanking skills legit are: make big dragon spin. Other than that hes useless
[9:45:45] Leysfort: can someone carry me in US
[9:45:49] Daara87: oo

[9:46:22] bYTEfROG: DPS fury
[9:46:26] Mirkooo: BrainRot
[9:46:30] Taylor131313: team name was BrainRot enjoyers
[9:46:44] Wardrick7: i can heal
[9:46:48] Vossie1990: O wait, can you sign for multiple groups? Because I did accept some random invite from a diff group that Im not even sure Ill play with KEKW
[9:47:00] Alastor7783: KEKW
[9:47:05] Mirkooo: Ditch them
[9:47:06] Alastor7783: don't think you can monkaW
[9:47:07] Draedra: is it the same banner from before or new one? Hmmge
[9:47:08] Taylor131313: groups don't really matter, you could technically get tournament access and pug
[9:47:12] PneumaWHU: I think for the toy, team doesn't matter
[9:47:19] PneumaWHU: just personally need to complete 2 15s
[9:47:24] bYTEfROG: last time, there were people in valkdrakken on the mdi server yelling for groups
[9:47:38] Aegis_2566: You need a team to get access to the Tournament Realm
[9:47:46] Taylor131313: yeah team is to get access
[9:47:46] Alastor7783: ^
[9:48:11] Vossie1990: if you dont need to play with a specific team that simplifies it alot. You can just call a date/time and we make groups on the go
[9:48:11] Esaw34: yo annie! whats that arrow addon?
[9:48:16] loppish91: i could heal
[9:48:18] Alastor7783: TomTom
[9:48:36] Vossie1990: but ye, to clarify, I have access, and can play with whoever. but I am already in a team.
[9:48:41] Taylor131313: yes and no, you need to get access first
[9:48:56] Aegis_2566: Technically yes
[9:48:58] Elerments: Yes
[9:49:00] Wardrick7: i think so
[9:49:01] Taylor131313: technically yes
[9:49:05] Wardrick7: need to check rules again
[9:49:09] Elerments: I had my entier team bale but still got in done with randoms
[9:49:29] c0rb4: what are you doing ?
[9:49:38] Aegis_2566: If one team has no tank I can help them out once TR is out
[9:49:40] Taylor131313: you don't pick a role when signing
[9:49:42] OJ_Hype: you could ask on discord
[9:49:42] xRelith: I can Tank
[9:49:45] Wardrick7: i probably could tank 15s
[9:49:51] c0rb4: what you need tank for i cant tank high end but can tank other stuff
[9:49:55] Vossie1990: in that case people can just sign as random shit and make groups, give everyone access and then play with whoever
[9:50:06] Mirkooo: @Wardrick7 For sure, i tanked 16's on my 460 DK xdd
[9:50:19] Wardrick7: ok

[9:50:42] Wardrick7: xdd
[9:50:48] Vossie1990: For real, if you cant do 15s as a bis geared 488 tank, you might need to visit a doctor KEKW
[9:50:55] Alastor7783: i have a team
[9:50:55] OJ_Hype: hes in our team
[9:50:58] Alastor7783: ^
[9:51:04] Aegis_2566: Alastor is in our team
[9:51:08] Taylor131313: @Vossie1990 I would probably struggle since I never tanked before
[9:51:09] Aegis_2566: We goin with giga blasters
[9:51:10] c0rb4: do you just need a tank for fyrakk assault ?
[9:51:15] Wardrick7: thank you Annie for helping anniesL
[9:51:18] Taylor131313: one day I'll probably try to tank
[9:51:22] c0rb4: ahh okey
[9:51:27] c0rb4: missunderstood :)
[9:51:30] Mirkooo: @Taylor131313 peepoChrist
[9:51:42] Taylor131313: yeah I'm sorry for the group that will have me as tank
[9:51:43] Vossie1990: @Taylor131313 The only thing that has stopped me from tanking is the pressure of getting the route perfect for 100%
[9:52:07] Taylor131313: @Vossie1990 I don't even know what buttons to press, so there's bigger issues for me xdd
[9:52:18] skibbatv: @Taylor131313 FeelsStrongMan I remember the day where m+ had deviations to the route
[9:52:21] Vossie1990: @Taylor131313 try number 1. its usually good.
[9:52:45] Taylor131313: why do pvp boxes even give low tier crests?
[9:52:50] Taylor131313: that's basically trash
[9:53:07] Vossie1990: @skibbatv I feel like the only dungeon that has some variations is everbloom and atal
[9:53:18] xRelith: Do you still need a tank. I don't think I fully understand how to sign up xD
[9:53:26] AnnieFuchsia: discord.gg/anniefuchsia
[9:53:28] Taylor131313: @Vossie1990 also Fall if you skip start, end, or pull 120% YEP
[9:53:33] AnnieFuchsia: @ wardrick
[9:54:04] xurnuxien: yeleTroll i hear
[9:54:09] Vossie1990: @Taylor131313 I guess, but thats still very linear you just skip at some point. Atal you actually go a diff route and everbloom you pick different packs I guess
[9:54:27] c0rb4: why are you farming the assaults what can it drop annie ?
[9:54:55] c0rb4: oohh
[9:54:57] Vossie1990: DWAGON Pog
[9:55:37] Vossie1990: just kill fyrakk in the raid, its faster voschKappa
[9:55:41] zoicers: I've looted the chest sooooo many times and I can NEVER get any of the armours
[9:55:47] Pestifer: what add on are you using to show the cc above the nameplates?
[9:55:51] PneumaWHU: while this zone is buggy, probably not worth farming the toy
[9:55:59] Aegis_2566: Ahskually, Fyrakk is a Wyvern guzuNerd
[9:56:10] PneumaWHU: maybe better when this is in plains
[9:56:10] Alastor7783: nuh-huh
[9:56:18] Alastor7783: he has arms, although tiny
[9:56:20] Alastor7783: he's a dragon
[9:56:22] zoicers: Sadge
[9:56:28] Mirkooo: The what now HUH
[9:56:30] Vossie1990: @Aegis_2566 Sorry, but we dont put people in boxes here. Fyrakk can identify as whatever he wants Madge
[9:56:31] PneumaWHU: no idea
[9:56:33] Alastor7783: HUH
[9:56:34] Azureynn: HUH
[9:56:37] loppish91: and again
[9:56:43] xXRenMikaelsonXx: WHAT
[9:56:45] Alastor7783: it's always been buggy
[9:56:46] PneumaWHU: but if the game keeps phasing people when it spawns, not really worth trying to spawn it
[9:56:47] DveevD: how to get that dragon =?
[9:56:49] decrode: HUH
[9:56:50] Alastor7783: not because of the big dicks
