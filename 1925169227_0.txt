[0:18:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mage is alright in hardcore as long as you don't do the crazy AOE farming stuff
[0:19:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having said that, I like druid better because they have heals and cat form is pretty quick leveling
[0:20:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cats don't ever have to stop to drink water, they just need a couple of seconds and they keep going
[0:22:20] Dcarter: Well I‚Äôm up gonna hang out here for a few
[0:22:45] Molvonos: An error in judgement in the making towSip
[0:22:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cat form is level 20, so getting up to that point can be the toughest part of druid....a lot of people die before then

[0:57:15] DunzoCD: yesterday was the last day for the Feat of Strength, that was the only limited time thing i think
[0:58:00] Molvonos: So fun fact, for the last secret, you can stay mounted
[0:59:01] kimmo_gaming: you have to click on a tablet first, then on the orb near the cave
[0:59:03] Molvonos: Yea, you can fly around and the torch will channel, so I just did loops around each statue

[5:38:51] Thralazaar: yeah it was just all spawned originally
[5:38:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: THe 4 piece gives extra damage and healing for being in that special empowered consecration
[5:40:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: So pretty much the prot paladin has to be aware of when the set bonus is stacking up, when the empowered consecration is down, then try to stay in it

[5:41:21] Pilha390: my BOOT is not ready for that mobs
[5:42:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess a lot of prot paladins try to always keep their consecration down, and routinely drop it again as they move, not easy to get that damage bonus
[5:43:07] Mecabeast: Wanting to buy talent for consecrate to follow the player
[5:43:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that one old talent that allowed the consecration to move with paladin would be handy for this tier set
[5:44:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, if all consecrations were empowered during that window, it could keep up
[5:44:23] Tyrou: no tank frontal and 4 piece garbage for that fight got it
[5:45:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: One thing tricky for paladins is that the cooldown for conescration is way less than the duration, easy to overwrite it

[5:46:35] Sicknessqt: Damn we're gonna be doing 1m dps in season 4 LUL
[5:46:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Death Knight can overwrite their ground buff with a second one, but the duration is about the same as the cooldown so it's not as easy to screw it up
[5:46:58] Pilha390: REEEEEEEEEEEE
[5:47:05] avarose8910: Oh shit u can actually do doti keys now?
[5:47:50] raldrik: doesnt sanguine basically nullify your 4 pc?

[5:47:54] Tyrou: @wEiRdO_dUdE death knight also gets free casts of their ground buff though so unless they make it so pally can get the buff on all consecrates it's so bad
[5:48:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: This definitely needs fixed
[5:48:27] Tyrou: @raldrik yeah sanguine is gonna screw any pallies with their 4 piece cause the constant moving

[5:50:15] CloudPants8081: KEKW
[5:51:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: @bloodyreapr It builds up stacks from judgments then when it gets to 10, the next consecration you drop is empowered (unless that 10 stack buff rolls off)
[5:51:22] REDSUNDERGROUND: what t imer was raid testing?

[5:53:26] DunzoCD: well you double killed trash before 2nd boss too right?
[5:53:59] Pilha390: the trash you think close to the frist door was the second place of the dawn
[5:54:20] Mecabeast: If if trash before 2nd boss is cou ting twice could be it

[5:59:35] Zirist: That Conscecrate needs to be glued to your feet to be viable as is
[6:00:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Instead of having the consecration become empowered, it could just empower the player for the duration of a consecration
[6:01:06] comp1: Is it raid testing too or only dungeons
[6:02:10] Gungre: I'm really surprised the DH rework hasn't been released yet
[6:02:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess the intent is to give you a little extra time before you have to drop the empowered consecration
[6:04:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it would work best for a Patchwerk kinda thing
[6:04:06] Zirist: The idea of all consecrates for 15 secs being empowered seems better than current

[7:38:02] Daniel_KB: @MrCheshireCat_ can you rephrase cause what you said is the same thing
[7:38:06] furiousduckling: If thats a dick, I think i need to go hospital
[7:38:08] oxie73: no
[7:38:17] oxie73: its about gaming pcs
[7:38:49] furiousduckling: Towelliee Tech Tips
[7:39:18] TexValhalla: we can hear discord towelliee if you aint aware
[7:39:31] oxie73: so i want to switch to a desk top. do i need to get the best stuff if i go through the origin
[7:39:43] onous_: @mrcheshirecat_ just stop typing... do everyone and yourself a favor and just stop..

[7:40:30] furiousduckling: @oxie73 Just bare in mind, it all depends on your requirements!
[7:40:32] Templexx: @oxie73 first rule is deciding your budget
[7:40:45] dynnesty: depends on what you want to play
[7:40:59] laeenaravenholdt: @oxie73 It really just depends on what type of games you want to play. Budget, your budget will determine that.

[7:41:04] oxie73: well i mean like blizard
[7:41:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I would use your budget as a starting point, something like a 4070 can play most stuff well
[7:41:16] oxie73: and going into shooters
[7:41:18] TexValhalla: it also depends on how much you want to spend, any pre built is going to be more expensive rather than doing it yourself
[7:41:38] oxie73: okay
[7:41:48] oxie73: thank you for your input
[7:41:52] nocturnal_2195: i still have my 2080
[7:42:00] CeruleanStar: i'm running starfield on my 2080ti easy /shrug
[7:42:01] nocturnal_2195: lol
[7:42:04] TheUnknowing: So i spent like 1k on my pc and it runs everything great but obviously the more you spend the better the pc will be and longer it will last.
[7:42:08] CeruleanStar: but it's time to upgrade the wife's 1080ti
[7:42:10] Nokterian: i always build my own pc's it is fun
[7:42:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: There for awhile, prebuilts were cheaper because they got the best deals on expensive video cards
[7:42:19] MackAttack1421: Prices have evened out due to more companies entering the build game
[7:42:23] furiousduckling: Its the Time/Experience aswell. If you haven't built many Pc's the time investment to learn and do it don't outweight paying the extra ¬£50-100 or whatever it is to pay for it
[7:42:28] MackAttack1421: Companies like Origin and ROG
[7:42:33] Lashroman: It would be nice if they made a second movie of WoW
[7:42:38] mavericks312: Also most casuals are buying prebuilts not building it themselves
[7:42:43] oxie73: one i looked at on there sight i went with aa intel 5 and 4060 i think

[7:42:48] SPMOkc73: the random availability of the parts made go premade for the 1st ever and its not really more expensive that way at all
[7:42:52] furiousduckling: @Lashroman A Netflix/amazon WoW show would be bis
[7:43:07] TexValhalla: no it would be nice if they made a remake movie of WoW or better yet a show tbh
[7:43:49] oxie73: i have a dino gaming notebook lol
[7:44:01] oxie73: i got it in 2006
[7:44:21] oxie73: or 2016 i ment lol asus
