[0:22:49] CrIKxS: Once a week
[0:22:53] RobertFalfa: its 3 day reset
[0:23:01] jorgenand: imo it should be  every time your faction wins.

[0:57:32] Jawmare: @SalvDali kronos have no gdkp, we still enjoy pugging so w/e
[0:57:37] exponentialgrow: fewer PuGs
[0:57:40] 龍王: every guild better have 5 runs going at once KEKW
[0:57:40] MikeKrond: it will be interesting to see how they want to stop gdkps and how ppl react, even as an experiment

[1:02:02] yoooofi: DNotLikeThis

[1:02:24] Kewzu: it won't be shown as clearly aka blizzard was happy. cause people dont see it igname
[1:02:30] dv12x: next meta will be $dkp
[1:02:32] Gumbot: there are ways to get around the system im sure but i think a lof pf people won't risk their account to do it
[1:02:33] Foxdonuts: if they end up banning/disabling gold trading for loot they could just swap to using another currency, black lotus, arcane crystals, peaceblooms etc etc
[1:02:37] Kewzu: it will just look better for them if it's not advertised ingame
[1:02:39] Len1366: yea i think a lot of people won't be willing to risk account for that
[1:02:42] Jawmare: whoever snitch gets 50% of the gold
[1:02:43] Chillstep_00: @SalvDali A lot of people won't do GDKP just because of the "fear" of getting banned. Just like buying gold from botters vs. token.
[1:02:45] steakmcc: Loot based on KPIs!
[1:02:45] Nightbot: any good loot drop today guys? Peepocomfy
[1:02:58] Kewzu: I think it's more about looking good rather then doing good, aka clearing out the chat from the advertisement
[1:03:01] Ranzorx: @SalvDali what are the odds GDKP every comes back after this to SoD? 0

[1:03:50] Niksen_99: There could also be some crazy GDKP where you buy loot on SOD but pay on Wrath or ERA
[1:03:54] Chillstep_00: @SalvDali All they have to do is ban a few gdkps here and there and the "fear" of getting banned will make alot of people stop.
[1:03:56] Kewzu: Yea, im fairly sure it sabout clearing out trade/world chat so the casuals won't see the gdkps and there for they dont exist for the normies
[1:04:04] Kewzu: and then people will be happier
[1:04:09] cg3051: If they say that anyone in gdkp is banned, all it takes is one loser with streamlabs to record and everyone gets banned
[1:04:20] SeraphimV2: make gdkps perma bannable
[1:04:26] SeraphimV2: people wont risk it
[1:04:34] floptimustv: personal loot goes completely against the second sentence in the post.
[1:04:34] netherwind_jon: They’d probably target the organizers cause they’re easier to detect (receiving a bunch of trades for gold / trading everyone their cut)
[1:04:43] summelons: just ban the big gdkp hosters on ea server
[1:04:47] Chernobyl26: @SeraphimV2 omg if they permaban gdkpers and not gold buyers/sellers that would be the funniest shit ever

[1:07:38] panjack13: a lot of Sod players do like to min max though
[1:07:52] Slavesz: the fact that they actually slowed down the lockouts for 2 weeks of P2, because oh no casuals will miss a reset makes it incredibly clear KEKW
[1:08:11] brooch_fan: there are try hards in SOD like orlando just because it's the new wow streamer meta

[1:15:34] llnikon: there were GDKPs from the very start of classic what are yall talking about

[1:15:50] abruptdecayO_O: bro dont try to rewrite history 2019 classic, gdkps were not meta
[1:15:52] abruptdecayO_O: period
[1:16:06] abruptdecayO_O: at the very end, naxx gdkps were starting to happen

[1:16:21] llnikon: 90% of runs are MS>OS
[1:16:40] nubbinttv: Idk, i think the "don't tell me how to have fun with the game" argument holds for SoD. Especially when its a social and raid structure mostly organized outside the game.
[1:16:48] Foxdonuts: its interesting how this change essentially means they find it easier to ban gdkp rather than to curb gold selling/buying
[1:17:06] Ranzorx: lets try reducing how some people have fun - its for the spirit of discovery!
[1:17:10] Oracle_WoW: tbf its a response to a lot of feedback. they didnt just come up with this out of the blue

[1:18:26] llnikon: I dont see them changing GDKP rules on old servers. Maybe a fresh server without it, but whats the point of playing a 4 year old server with tons of gold if your gold is worthless

[1:19:05] Gumbot: it seems like this is more a way to get at RMT rather than GDKP, its hard to argue against the merit of GDKP as RMT is its only drawback

[1:19:22] MEA_99: I really just have not picked up on this Dad Gamer vibe SoD notion. maybe im just giga naiive but im not seeing it
[1:19:41] llnikon: I think the big difference is SoD is still very new, people havent farmed for years of gold

[1:20:46] gikei: removing this wont do anything to bots or rmt. GDKP has existed even since original wrath and tbc. if they want to affect bots or rmt, ban the bots. Even without gdkp the prices still will rise all the same and dadgames will stillwhine
[1:20:47] RobertFalfa: in wrath they removed all quirks. Like fieryy, garg haste snapshot and bearr weaving. Arguing they created frictions for the general player

[1:23:21] ViciousRI: GDKP will just happen in discord now behind the scenes... my gdkp group keeps out ledger in a private discord channel only myself and the leader can see, and they draw from my balance there instead of trading in game

[1:24:37] LoRswat: How exactly would you solve it?
[1:24:58] AndersonKT24: because blizzard isn't honest frequently enough to be believed
[1:24:58] Slavesz: because they're afraid to say "we ran out of ideas against RMT" KEKW
[1:24:59] Ranzorx: because gdkp does not equal pug in every case
[1:25:14] Ranzorx: plenty of people do gdkp with the same people every week on discord
[1:25:43] Phuiston: How is that different from people wanting to do raids alone with NPCs like in final fantasy and soon in retail. I think its important to keep guilds a thing.
[1:26:30] Ranzorx: honestly the 10 man raid dungeons and pvp focused content has me considering tuning out of SoD at least until max level phase
[1:26:30] XXOM: either way im glad they banned gdkps

[1:26:42] Milkasserton: We live in a society!
[1:26:52] Wesselch: I don't think they do hurt the traditional guild/social structure thing because most gdkps have much higher barriers to entry than dad guilds
[1:26:58] panjack13: it feels like they are banning how botted gold enters the economy

[1:27:05] yuhkz: i dunno im not a dad gamer and i still think gdkps are dumb
[1:27:05] gikei: So make a pug guild, use egdkp, donate gold to guildbank for points, use points for gear. Redeem gold for points. Is that then acceptable? this removes nothing

[1:28:02] Ishkandir: plus if you have to "pug" you dont have to completely swap loot systems

[1:28:29] grillparty1992: dont you think that SoD being as popular as it is, may be a major factor why bots that have been banned once on Era arent coming back? @SalvDali
[1:28:36] gikei: true, its as much guild and social structure as weekly SR run
[1:28:40] Fallacy_o7: how often do you get in discord with your gdkp players? @SalvDali outside of raid, when do you talk to them
[1:28:48] grillparty1992: @Len1366 no because if you suck at the game youll get deducted.

[1:31:50] jlegretta: most of these players are way too lazy to farm gold and do gdkps the way they're supposed to work, so without swiping they'd go back to joining a guild for raids/loot

[1:34:34] AyyyPapi1: not true. bots are there because of the need for gold for consumes and gdkps
[1:35:10] Kewzu: There was a good reason for banwave tho, a old security dude that streams said that a big rason tehy don't ban often is cause that gives the botcreator a easier way to test new methods since they get banned quickly
[1:35:20] yoooofi: juicccy
[1:35:38] Kewzu: if you get banned instantly, you can test new methods with quick itterations

[1:36:10] Cantbreakme: @Kewzu this
[1:36:29] yuhkz: arent those two terms interchangeable
[1:36:31] Slavesz: @Kewzu that plus if you secretly can detect botters without their knowledge, you can catch much more of them than if you inform them every 5 days that their methods are detectable
[1:36:50] AndersonKT24: not "mostly" but firstly
[1:36:51] Kewzu: @Slavesz Yea, thats how it was explaiend by former blizzard employee
[1:37:02] SardToken: wait what is gold bid raids?
[1:37:28] javizem9: while I agree with that from blizzard, the GDKP I do are better than my guild and dare I say more fun at times
[1:37:30] jlegretta: that's because there's no incentive for geared/good players to join regular pugs, they get nothing from it
[1:37:31] TURBOBOOSTER3000: @SardToken gbid is personal gain, gdkps is split maong the raid

[1:49:37] slupo: if players are in an instance and they trade gold for an item. that's it. like you said you could probably do the trade later but it would be more incovenient
[1:49:46] GT_Memster: They'll probably disable gold trading in dungeons, and soul-bound items as soon as the instance is left.  That is an easy first step.  The outside detection systems ... you have to compete with trading, AH etc and how that can all blend into a grey space

[4:38:40] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[4:38:56] overpaide: u should play hardcore
[4:39:13] Kapers_: I honestly only pug SOD every raid, not in a guild, it's not so bad
[4:39:18] Niksen_99: When i play i feel like i need to have something to do.. Not waste time. I cant just do world pvp for hours for example
[4:39:57] Midiosa: lol a lot of groups still struggle on the last two bosses in BFD
[4:40:15] skaboom17: bfd is harder than any raid in vanilla
[4:40:55] Kapers_: @skaboom17 you're hardcore memeing right
[4:40:58] simonromlie: A big reason why I want better gear is so I can farm more efficiently
[4:41:00] Niksen_99: U did alot of comfy farming when u got full bis
[4:41:11] overpaide: it sounds like you’d like hardcore from everything you’re saying tbh
[4:41:19] itsurewantme: only nerds farm
[4:41:21] WalterWhite__69: is this Northrend ?
[4:41:25] kenxxys: i was there!
[4:41:26] Kapers_: @skaboom17 o you're the guy from earlier LUL
[4:41:32] hypno7iq: hardcore for sad emo people
[4:41:32] Nightbot: Dali is not interested in playing hardcore now or in the future. He does not enjoy leveling or playing the game extremely cautiously. Yes, it's better to stream HC right now. No, Dali does not care.
[4:41:45] Kapers_: @SalvDali please don't listen to him saying BFD is hard LUL, please don't
[4:41:49] skaboom17: @Kapers_ it was intended to get the exact reaction you provided. trolls win again
[4:42:04] Flugame88: lol bfd definitely not harder then vanilla naxx / aq40 without buffs
[4:42:08] exponentialgrow: he likes to play risky and frisky
[4:42:16] kenxxys: @skaboom17 not even a troll though, id argue early kelris was as hard as any early raid bosses
[4:42:23] overpaide: hc is minmaxing…
[4:42:23] Nightbot: Dali is not interested in playing hardcore now or in the future. He does not enjoy leveling or playing the game extremely cautiously. Yes, it's better to stream HC right now. No, Dali does not care.
[4:42:56] overpaide: ohh ok
[4:42:58] Beaverbrod: @kenxxys it was "hard" on first 2 resets when ppl had no bis runes/no preraid bis
[4:43:02] overpaide: i get it
[4:43:40] kenxxys: @Beaverbrod glad u agree with me

[4:55:38] kenxxys: not at all
[4:55:41] P45HKO: Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one.
