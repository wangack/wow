[0:22:57] Molvonos: Towelliee will likely play D2 when it suits him, rather than shelf it completely like BG3, which didn't suite his playstyle.  However, I'm merely speculating.
[0:27:15] farmcheeze: fun fact, towellie used to play a game called team fortress classic, he used to go by SonGokuu. He did a radio show every thursday night when we did league play. So yes, pretty legendary @llNoTToXiCll

[1:03:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: They did just launch the official Classic Hardcore servers, yeah. They have some good changes
[1:03:51] twisteryz: @Lostdogal im 30 and in all that time it happend 1 time
[1:04:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Things like it's really hard to flag for PvP, limited leash ranges, faster quest mob respawn times, and permadeath
[1:04:24] twisteryz: but ofc i dont live in the us
[1:04:52] mustbepog: what does HC include? like can you pvp and raid. is it perma death?
[1:04:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: So no dragons being kited into major cities (a little bit of a letdown), but overall it's a much better hardcore experience
[1:05:21] CeruleanStar: i feel like we have been here before? :D
[1:05:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: You can flag for PvP but they fixed the issues with quest mobs and such flagging you

[2:24:48] zeiours: Just CPR azeorth....
[2:24:54] ninedraft317: i think she is a titan of chaos
[2:24:56] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: "heal her wounds"
[2:25:01] TombStoneMercenary: Bounty the quicker picker upper
[2:25:14] oradros: will see if the sword disapear
[2:25:22] Molvonos: What sword?
[2:25:22] Ribbwich: @Molvonos ¿Qué espada?
[2:25:24] Mecabeast: If azeroth is going to wake up means magni will return
[2:25:29] NobodybetterPat: CHAMPIONNNN
[2:25:39] S1appadabass: THE WOONS
[2:25:39] CrunkyBrewster: CHAAAMPPOIIN
[2:25:44] Taddict: hey chat, my first time playing hardcore and i wanna ask: do you want to be ahead of level on every zone? and milk xp on all small zones?
[2:25:46] valianya: Enerald Dream is a reflection of the world prior to the Sundering, the pangaea continent of Kalimdor.  Going there would be a massive continent.
[2:25:54] CrunkyBrewster: Er HWoons
[2:25:58] abracka_: "champyon we dun fucked up feeding the planet azerite"
[2:26:10] Molvonos: @Ribbwich Nani no ken?
[2:26:12] TombStoneMercenary: Oh no the Grapes
[2:26:17] Connectus: @Taddict milk as much as you can, the vanilla world is deadly as hell
[2:26:21] Connectus: Fart against the wind and you'll die
[2:26:23] Dumboodaking: What if when azeroth awakens we're able to pilot her like a mech and get a vehicle only mech expansion?
[2:26:30] Nokterian: naguuraDrunk
[2:26:33] snake_like: give me more class fantasy stuff like legion and the story backdrop doesn't matter much to me
[2:26:34] Taddict: i see ty
[2:26:34] Ribbwich: @Molvonos kaun see talavaar?
[2:26:35] Lausten: For the love of all that is holy.. Save the wine..
[2:26:39] jsullivanj: Nice
[2:26:39] Connectus: The stronger you go into a new zone the better
[2:26:54] NobodybetterPat: farm the defias for a green
[2:26:54] rosina_scarlett: about to have our second 60
[2:27:20] bad_fish_too: Milking green zones is the strat
[2:27:20] rosina_scarlett: Yeah. a second mage is about to hit 60 xD
[2:27:22] FutileDiploma: @towelliee did you get to the point to craft another wayfinder
[2:27:35] Connectus: Mages are OP
[2:27:38] mavericks312: Fitting that the best class reached 60 first
[2:28:22] Ribbwich: @Towelliee wowhead Defias Thugs can only drop Shadowgems
[2:28:23] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:28:30] limburgse: there is a queue now @ Stitches
[2:28:33] KeidooTV: free to play
[2:28:36] Connectus: Yeah, I'm waiting for F2P
[2:28:36] chamack4040: Do you think blizzard will ever make a world of Warcraft 2?
[2:28:37] KeidooTV: ?
[2:28:41] skdmaster: Highest queue I had over the weekend was like 45
[2:29:02] Connectus: @chamack4040 why would they though, there's no need for it
[2:29:13] KeidooTV: @Connectus eu i had 1h
[2:29:17] TombStoneMercenary: Would rather see a new warcraft RTS and let them bake the next expansion for a while
[2:29:17] JBarlak: @chamack4040 why? Just updates. Sorry too muc( story there
[2:29:25] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  there is still random dcs and buıgs here and there but servers seems more stable then last week imo
[2:29:29] Rottencoarse: for wayfinder
[2:29:30] valianya: Also, look at the existing landmasses, Where's the Equatorial tropic zone?  Farthest south zones, STV, Krasarang Wilds, Feralas.  All tropic jungle zones are far south.  That means everything we know on Azeroth is only in Northern Hemisphere
[2:29:30] Molvonos: People learned from Sony's attempt at Everquest 2.
[2:29:34] Lausten: We are on WoW 10, why do people keep talking about TBC? LUL
[2:29:35] Molvonos: And how absolutely stupid it was.
[2:29:39] Kelticlore: there are those situations where to sustain you must evolve
[2:29:41] chamack4040: True true that makes sense, didn’t think of it that way
[2:30:01] Ribbwich: @Towelliee I dont think these guys drop green armor or weapons, but, they are over valued in xp
[2:30:06] abracka_: @Molvonos i still have PTSD of the original everquest map
[2:30:07] oradros: spawn rate doesnt help
[2:30:16] Connectus: @Molvonos or FF XIV 1.0 literally being FF XI but modern graphics. It was horrible... Yoshida had to come in and fix that horrible mess and made it into what it is now
[2:30:40] Molvonos: @abracka_ lol.  What, you don't want to go back to The Overthere and get run down by Skorpocs or Dragoons?
[2:30:48] Zettabyte: Unlimited bag space would surly be a evolution of WoW, Towel Kappa
[2:30:49] nox503: mehdiRIP murlocs spawn so fast its easy to get surrounded and die
[2:30:57] Connectus: Well, it was worse than FF XI actually, FF XI is still fun
[2:31:00] abracka_: @Molvonos towStop towIt
[2:31:26] Dalsonson: Now, hear me out Towelliee, but do you honestly think Destiny 2 is stricly an FPS? Cause to me that blends an MMO and FPS pretty well
[2:31:26] Connectus: The graphics are better though in retail WoW
[2:31:29] Molvonos: @abracka_ I cant tell you how many people I've killed, intentionally or otherwise, as my bard.  Selos'ing over the Gash and 'lagging' ahead of them out of range.
[2:31:39] MisterYeeticus: Its World of Dungeons and Dragons
[2:31:41] KeidooTV: i prefer the the graphics wow has now
[2:31:41] radiorahem: People who think Graphics make a game are the ones that buy store mounts
[2:31:43] Connectus: Unreal Engine isn't going to make a huge difference, maybe some lighting
[2:31:44] bad_fish_too: I lost two characters at 13 and 15 to shit spawning right away.
[2:31:48] xmushroomfart: @towelliee I want remnant 2 graphics with class wow
[2:31:49] NobodybetterPat: i dont get the people who want wow on ue5 tbh. wow is how it is for a reason
[2:31:51] Sicknessqt: WoW art style is amazing
[2:32:10] TombStoneMercenary: plus you can run this on a potato
[2:32:13] kernel_panic11: 100% agree
[2:32:13] Avegrado: how would you feel about an mmo that abandoned leveling and gave you your kit through class and gear loadout?
[2:32:17] Gr8MooglyGoogly: @queban_305 same
[2:32:17] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:32:20] Connectus: WoW's art style is awesome, it has a very particular look you can't do with "realistic" graphics
[2:32:24] NobodybetterPat: yep
[2:32:27] Ribbwich: @Towelliee careful, they might be a monster
[2:32:34] bad_fish_too: @Gr8MooglyGoogly Annoying af.
[2:32:41] abracka_: @Molvonos i can't even fault you, i was a necromancer and just blasted everything with ease
[2:32:47] kernel_panic11: The fact that wow official HC is the most exciting MMO release right now says a lot about the state of the genre
[2:32:48] Timothious: would like to see what a wow that has the original EQ play rules
[2:32:50] Zythron2: not hard to keep cartoon looking good, like borderlands and cell shading, will always look good
[2:32:52] Avegrado: true, but i feel most of them are instance based
[2:32:56] Connectus: Level progression is more fun imo than just purely gear progression
[2:33:07] xziyn: Isn't WoW's original engine a modified version of Warcraft3's?

[2:33:24] Avegrado: the only example i can think of with a persistant world is albion but i feel they didnt do the systems justice
[2:33:27] valianya: VR mmo rpg
[2:33:34] Lausten: @xziyn The alpha was
[2:33:42] Connectus: Yup, gearing will just replace leveling
[2:33:45] xmushroomfart: @towelliee so u don’t think unreal 5 classic wow would be successful?
[2:33:45] Avegrado: true, but i feel it might make itemization more interesting
[2:33:46] kamuriz: 2 60s now }}
[2:33:51] chamack4040: @towelliee are you planning in the future to play ashes of creation?
[2:33:55] Gr8MooglyGoogly: @queban_305 Just have to use it as a learning experience I guess to try not to get into a situation like that lol
[2:34:02] Lausten: @Lausten Or like in house testing version..
[2:34:07] Ribbwich: @Mecabeast yeah that system also makes a lot of weird story alterations too, it's not just the binary system that's the problem, it's the other associated headaches of it
[2:34:11] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee any truth to the rumor that RDF is coming to wrath classic finally?
[2:34:13] MourvinMad: yeah RPGs are always going to have some cost to power pipeline
[2:34:13] Avegrado: lowkey hope the genre stays the same anyway, just want some niche tweaks
[2:34:13] Connectus: @xmushroomfart it wouldn't change the look much MingLee. It's not like Unreal Engine magically makes it look super realistic with the same assets
[2:34:19] Connectus: That's what people need to understand the most
[2:34:21] cripplious: you cant pubg in wow
[2:34:21] EKS90_: destiny had a leveling experiance, but with removal of the red war campaign and stuff in the mainstory it just... removed a lot of the game imo.
[2:34:24] BLagle22: zoomers all about the instant gratification
[2:34:25] Empyrialist: GW/GW2 tried to do so much to reduce the gear grind, but I'm not sure how successful it was in comparison to other MMOs. Certainly it has a huge base that feels that it was successful though.
[2:34:34] Connectus: They could go for a realistic artstyle with WoW right now without Unreal Engine. It's just that it wouldn't look like WarCraft
[2:34:36] warrenny: I wish wow was a shooter Kappa
[2:34:44] Molvonos: Itemization becomes less interesting when your skills/kit are required to play it, it means you're minmaxing the absolute shit out of your gear (like Diablo-style end game), which doesnt really fit the MMO style too well beyond a few rare exceptions.
[2:34:51] bad_fish_too: @Gr8MooglyGoogly I rolled a priest this time. Slow as hell leveling, but good survivability.
[2:34:53] valianya: MMORPG dating sim, lol
[2:34:54] magemaster225: do you think blizzard could create a genshin type game
[2:34:56] Connectus: @warrenny Agreed, shoot lasers out of my sword and shield Kappa
[2:34:58] kamuriz: engine
[2:34:59] rosina_scarlett: I would love to see SWTOR get upgraded graphics
[2:35:13] kernel_panic11: I think classic wow is the best MMO of all time. I like the adventure of leveling. I’m not a huge fan of retail wow. Just feels like a rush to max level and then min maxing stats to push keys/arenas
[2:35:15] aimassistallen: i think wow could benefit from a fresh start lol
[2:35:15] Ribbwich: I wish gameplay was a bit more dynamic
[2:35:17] NoorOnline: I want a wow 2 with souls like combat
[2:35:22] nox503: I am still curious what the titan mmo was like before they scraped it for overwatch
[2:35:24] PvtHudson093: i aint giving up almost 20 years of achievements
[2:35:26] cripplious: @Connectus you mean legend of zelda
[2:35:27] Ribbwich: @rosina_scarlett SWTOR can't update it's AH
[2:35:30] Alienfromger: optimized netcode for battlegrounds without lag
[2:35:34] loscidal: Did you ever play Star Wars Galaxies?
[2:35:36] devoted_bee: An MMO designed from the ground up with hardcore in mind and "rogue-like" elements could be interesting
[2:35:36] darkbull36: Fresh start new players
[2:35:41] Sicknessqt: @Noorishad  what LUL LUL
[2:35:44] EKS90_: releasing wow 2 just for a " new engine " will not really do much in the end.
[2:35:46] Molvonos: @kernel_panic11 That's all Classic was too.  You got to end game to 'start playing'.
[2:35:47] Connectus: Exactly
[2:35:55] Empyrialist: Man I just played through KotFE for the the first time, and those cinematics were pretty great.
[2:36:02] Connectus: It gives me a headache when people say "Unreal Engine will make the game look better"
[2:36:03] Ribbwich: SWTOR can't make it so my hair shows under a hood like..
[2:36:03] rosina_scarlett: have MMO be playing in VR
[2:36:07] rosina_scarlett: LUL
[2:36:10] Molvonos: They have one of those, Rosina.
[2:36:13] Lausten: We are on WoW 10, why do people keep talking about WoW 2? (TBC) LUL
[2:36:18] Molvonos: I'm in the alpha for it actually, lol

[2:36:28] rosina_scarlett: @Molvonos :O

[2:36:43] FalconKline: VR is a niche market and won't take over every game
[2:36:48] KShellZx: bring back garrisons!
[2:36:50] Ribbwich: @rosina_scarlett SWTOR can't even allow me to post an auction for more then a billion credits
[2:36:53] rosina_scarlett: let me go kill Lichking in VR though
[2:36:57] rosina_scarlett: @Ribbwich xD
[2:36:58] Connectus: The way WoW feels, is simply perfect
[2:37:06] unowncreature: They need to improve their story imo
[2:37:08] kernel_panic11: @molvonos I strongly disagree. I enjoyed classic endgame, but the leveling experience was half the fun as well
[2:37:11] Avegrado: what i honestly want is a light horror  action game set in a dungeons and dragons lore accurate high fantasy world.  Build a wolrd that emphasizes how terrifying the implications of a high fantasy world can be
[2:37:12] rosina_scarlett: @Ribbwich you got a billion credits? i got 350k xD
[2:37:12] Nokterian: and its almost 20 years old
[2:37:13] 8Lusk: to make wow look better they would need to revamp all models and textures and fx etc
[2:37:14] HoboFighter2: Keeps people coming back every big xpac and patch
[2:37:16] Nokterian: rooOld
[2:37:20] Alienfromger: they did overwatch 2 they could also do wow2
[2:37:23] kamuriz: its mostly copy pastad
[2:37:29] Rudric_Ice: Wow best game it is known
[2:37:35] KShellZx: i actually really enjoyed wildstar
[2:37:35] KeidooTV: i miss wild star
[2:37:39] CeruleanStar: madseason dropped a video not too long ago about how the magic has been lost on MMO's lately
[2:37:42] knifeparrty: I still play Ultima Online
[2:37:43] Ribbwich: @rosina_scarlett The inflation is so bad now, man. It's sooo bad, the AH being insanely out of date doesn't help.
[2:37:45] Sicknessqt: @Alienfromger but whats the point?
[2:38:03] rosina_scarlett: @Ribbwich ah
[2:38:07] Molvonos: @kernel_panic11 Eh, agree to disagree.  I've been playing WoW since closed beta, leveling was 'an experience', not half of it though, and certainly nothing really memorable unless you were 'casual'.
[2:38:10] Zythron2: WoW isnt as popular anymore as you think it is
[2:38:12] rosina_scarlett: @Ribbwich I'm only 51 currently
[2:38:27] botscast: do u think next expac will beat SL sales given that its 20y anni, 10th expac etc maybe more hype?
[2:38:28] Zythron2: is it a good game, absolutely, but people are moving on
[2:38:30] Molvonos: @rosina_scarlett Look up Zenith MMO on Steam
[2:38:37] 8Lusk: i hate how aoc handles flying mounts
[2:38:43] mavericks312: @zythron2 sales an sub rention would disagree with you
[2:38:44] rosina_scarlett: @Molvonos OH I have that wishlisted
[2:38:52] numbthepatient: You feel dwarf is better than human for pally or no go human??
[2:38:56] Ribbwich: @Towelliee I wan to combine STO and SWTOR
[2:39:11] Lausten: Glad I only ever played WoW and will only ever play WoW..
[2:39:13] loscidal: Nothing changes until it does! When WoW came out nothing out there was like it.  Nothing changes until someone comes up with something new that changes  it all.
[2:39:20] astanyx1: allegedly
[2:39:21] Empyrialist: Speaking of player-based economies, an EVE style economy in a fantasy MMO would be cool.
[2:39:24] Zythron2: @mavericks312 it's because the same poeple have 400 accounts, its definately scewed
[2:39:32] Connectus: I think the problem with other MMORPGs vs WoW is that Blizzard just nailed the gameplay in such a way that no other dev can make it play like that. It's just so smooth, never had any other game that felt as good and responsive as WoW

[2:39:56] Ribbwich: allegedly in the legal "it says this on a court report" sense.
[2:40:00] Rudric_Ice: @lausten  exactly new gamers don't really play this game u guys are the target audience
[2:40:04] roadkey15: what add on are you using for  questing?
[2:40:15] KShellZx: sir, why are you yelling
[2:40:21] DunzoCD: KEKW
[2:40:21] CrunkyBrewster: WutFace MURLOCS
[2:40:24] rosina_scarlett: KEKW
[2:40:25] Clay2K_: @Towelliee is it an addon that reads the quests or is it just the in-game audio?
[2:40:27] CrunkyBrewster: HELP!
[2:40:27] mavericks312: @rudric_ice you mean gamers who can’t focus on anything for more then 15 minutes
[2:40:30] Ribbwich: LOL let him cook!
[2:40:31] unowncreature: probably questie
[2:40:31] robbo1010: sir this is wendys

[2:40:44] botscast: the murlocs!
[2:40:45] TheLoneRanger2016: are they using AI voices @Towelliee
[2:40:48] Nokterian: LUL
[2:40:51] Connectus: WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE! MORE TROOPS!!!! AAAHH!!!!! Kappa
[2:40:51] EKS90_: @Clay2K_ Voiceover addon for classic wow, it only works there and is AI driven to make it voiceacted.
[2:40:58] Connectus: @TheLoneRanger2016 yep
[2:40:58] MedicineMan: he's yelling because the quest designer wrote the text in caps.
[2:40:58] Ribbwich: *grabs adventurer* THE MINES OH MY GOD
[2:40:58] Timothious: ok couldn't use that add on lol
[2:41:02] CrunkyBrewster: I love that voice over addon. the Dwarves and Gnomes crack me up the most
[2:41:12] Connectus: @Ribbwich MingLee
[2:41:17] firehawk73: That "Fatality" sound might be coming from the "Bug Sack" addon...you might want to disable it @Towelliee
[2:41:26] Connectus: Imagine the world being conquered by murlocs Kappa
[2:41:29] Lausten: Getting boosted KEKW
[2:41:34] Connectus: Oh wait, there's already a timeline where that happened Kappa
[2:41:43] DunzoCD: please send bag
[2:41:54] NobodybetterPat: this is what we call a big brain move
[2:41:54] Ribbwich: @Connectus that dude is doing whippets inbetween handing out quests ngl
[2:42:02] CeruleanStar: i might make a dps war i dunno
[2:42:16] CeruleanStar: stack green agi gear and win
[2:42:21] Molvonos: It'll save your ass, no doubt
[2:42:23] Spykex02: Wait the hc server is already out?
[2:42:24] Ribbwich: @Towelliee Sell the Linen
[2:42:29] limburgse: @Towelliee, which server are you on? :)
[2:42:31] Ribbwich: @Towelliee one peice at a time
[2:42:32] Connectus: @CeruleanStar warrior is fun, decided to make one after my priest died
[2:42:39] Rottencoarse: dont forget the quest inside the inn @Towelliee
[2:42:48] Timothious: theres 2 HC servers right?
[2:42:49] Nokterian: i always mute bug sack
[2:43:00] Rudric_Ice: @mavericks312  u mean gamers who have to do a bit of stuff to play the actual game i.e endgame when most of the games nowadays u can just join and play
[2:43:10] Nokterian: DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT FOR  LISTENING TO OUR LORD AND SAVIOR C'THUN?
[2:43:12] Nokterian: KEKW
[2:43:12] Connectus: YOU NO TAKE CANDLE!
[2:43:19] Ribbwich: You bring him 5 candles and he will give you 15 candles, he is a Westfallian Prince
[2:43:40] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  stitches realm on EU has like 3-4k queue during prime time
[2:43:45] Deekan33: EU had ques
[2:43:46] Lintgamer: Waaay to late imo
[2:43:54] KeidooTV: theres no need for more servers 2 was fine
[2:43:55] astanyx1: Classic+ woulld be hype
[2:43:59] Connectus: EU still has queues
[2:44:01] Spykex02: Yeah it def died down I didn’t even hear about this launch
[2:44:03] valianya: Its also in the middle of huge game releases
[2:44:04] Connectus: Was in queue for 15 min
[2:44:07] limburgse: EU stlll has queues
[2:44:18] cripplious: @Towelliee has your gear let you down contact Defias Brotherhood you might have a case
[2:44:20] limburgse: im in queue now :P for like 30 minutes

[2:46:38] Syllvn: I am still playing BG3, if only HC was closer to Christmas
[2:46:42] Lausten: It is new though, and we are far into the season, most casual guilds have cleared and are on break, of course the hardcore hype will draw some extra veiwers..
[2:46:49] haseorogue2: i died to a power outage last night
[2:46:49] rosina_scarlett: you have to go to SW to get mining if you do

[2:47:05] geokouts: mining gives stam buff, skining crit

[2:47:07] Avegrado: engineering is great for early aoe
[2:47:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: herbalism is solid in hardcore

[2:48:51] herzlustafir: it is what it is its easier to go thru it if you dont fight it and get some good flasks to go with it. we could use it further along the road.
[2:49:00] geokouts: Goldshire has  LW, skinner, tailor, BS and fishing
[2:49:11] Rottencoarse: wrong way btw :D

[2:50:33] Ribbwich: LUL
[2:50:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoW has solid viewership
[2:50:45] KeidooTV: @CeruleanStar diablo 4 is the quickest game blizz as ever killed lol
[2:50:45] limburgse: careful, you will find lvl 9 rogues in those fields
[2:50:47] Rottencoarse: haters? :D

[2:51:53] shortyforthewin: will you play more destiny  that got interesting with better gear for u soon i dunno never played it myself not that far as you
[2:52:04] Connectus: @robinhejlol they did, you can't ressurect which means ankh doesn't work and no soulstone. Paladins can't bubble hearth anymore in hc
[2:52:12] neverbornlucky: Towelliee question would you try a Pickle Milkshake . Its a thing at disneyworld epcot food and wine this year lol
[2:52:15] Timothious: seen a whole group die watching another HC stream
[2:52:33] Ribbwich: @neverbornlucky yeah dude
[2:52:44] Fugazi811: the hardcore death videos are fun already
[2:52:54] Herzenliegen: @neverbornlucky Did you try it?
[2:52:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Not sure why they didn't do drops or anything for Arena World Championships, could have gotten more viewers
[2:52:54] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:52:55] Ribbwich: mayo is basically milk, and ranch is basically mayo and ranch is basically pickles
[2:53:06] PvtHudson093: looking forward to the paladin stuff on the traders post this week
[2:53:14] Barbarossa85: Is paladin the best class for HC classic?
[2:53:21] DunzoCD: whats the speedrun time gonna be on ICC? LUL
[2:53:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they should be pimping Diablo 4 for all its worth
[2:53:41] Vesidian: I'd love to see Diablo player numbers since S1 dropped.
[2:53:41] neverbornlucky: its just funny watching people try it
[2:53:44] Ribbwich: @DunzoCD they should do it live for AGDQ
[2:53:48] xrandomdoodx: drops should be a standard practice with every new content release, its dumb not to  these days lol
[2:53:52] EpicWookiee: So Classic saved WoW? Which is funny because they tried to tell everyone that we didn't want it
[2:54:11] KeidooTV: 30mins Q in stitches /
[2:54:15] bad_fish_too: LUL
[2:54:21] Ribbwich: oof
[2:54:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: This is just awful, 2K viewers
[2:54:27] neverbornlucky: just wait for season 2 of diablo4 Towelliee Vampires
[2:54:31] Ribbwich: common blizzard L
[2:54:31] Clay2K_: only 2k watchign diablo. yikers
[2:54:35] valianya: Poor season tho
[2:54:38] Arch0ntas777: Path of exile has more...
[2:54:41] Alienfromger: d4 deadge :(
[2:54:46] DunzoCD: the internet adopted the D4 bad meme
[2:54:57] KeidooTV: @neverbornlucky just wait for another let down thats what you mean
[2:55:18] KombatWombat07: they dont create a game for twitch viewership, but damn I hope they try to make the game better for those who want to actually play it
[2:55:18] essadis: i enjoy d4 for what it is. when i feel like playing i play it
[2:55:22] Ribbwich: @DunzoCD yeah sounds like the internet interfacing with a Blizz game.
[2:55:29] NineSeven8: I think MMOs and ARPGs are always have a short life span on twitch anyway.
[2:55:33] bad_fish_too: Diablo is gonna be dead till they add more endgame stuff to do. Chain running nightmare dungeons is not it.
[2:55:34] neverbornlucky: Towelliee can't wait for 1 minute Vampire random respawn
[2:55:41] itjustfeelsright: POE has topped out at like 200k players based on steam charts, diablo has more players just more non streamers
[2:55:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Season 2 of Diablo 4 could really be hot, if Blizzard does it right
[2:56:01] SonOfMinerva: What else is everyone playing right now to hold them over until Starfield? I cant get anything to hold my attention lol
[2:56:01] Rjmar: What addon is doing the reading?
[2:56:03] Ribbwich: the comparison between views on twitch and games being good is a troubling situation
[2:56:08] AnimalCrackers_19: POE is not visually appealing too many particals on screen I lose track of what going on
[2:56:10] Clay2K_: @Towelliee is that an addon to read the quest text?
[2:56:13] Fugazi811: @Rjmar voice over
[2:56:26] NineSeven8: ppl on twitch like to see PvP drama, top games are always PvP games
[2:56:27] Arendo26: i just learned something new... didnt know to bring new ranks of spells to my bars lol
[2:56:37] radiorahem: What’s the name of the commentator add on?
[2:56:43] NobodybetterPat: drops bring people.
[2:56:48] PvtHudson093: Being honest D4 was bad to watch, I was bored watching it. Props to you playing it but it wasnt for me.
[2:56:58] Ribbwich: @Arendo26 yeah, rank dropping is super important
[2:57:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Drops fuel the hype, which brings in more players and gets players more active
[2:57:13] xrandomdoodx: drops are literally free advertisement hack lol
[2:57:17] rosina_scarlett: I hate this old icebeard quest in Dun morogh
[2:57:23] SonOfMinerva: LUL
[2:57:26] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  blizz doesnt gets it from the drops prespective imo
[2:57:28] Ribbwich: especially for healing
[2:57:29] radiorahem: People love free shit idk why it’s so hard for them to understand
[2:57:39] rosina_scarlett: was me  during MoP beta
[2:57:53] Ribbwich: @Towelliee I don't remember when I started watching you, I know my stat page is wrong
[2:57:56] bubbles1489: Thats how i started watching you. from the drops. So I prime sub with you too
[2:58:02] Zettabyte: Streamers should have their own drops, imagine a Towelliee drop towPog
[2:58:05] Phantomstrk: sounds like blizz was like "we don't see how the metrics benefit us, and we don't care that it benefits you, sooo..not really caring about drops" lol
[2:58:22] Ribbwich: I know I was watching your channel when Legion was announced
[2:58:23] Vesidian: 100
[2:58:28] Arch0ntas777: classic paladin seals animations are the best @Towelliee
[2:58:29] rosina_scarlett: MoP beta is when I first started watching @Towelliee
[2:58:34] geokouts: mining on your left
[2:58:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pretty much every time WoW does drops, I see new people, new to Twitch, asking about how they work
[2:58:41] itjustfeelsright: cant you ask a guard where the trainers are?
[2:58:54] Ribbwich: @rosina_scarlett yeah had to be close to that at least
[2:59:07] mianerten: what server are you on?
[2:59:14] Syllvn: Almost certainly
[2:59:25] Rjmar: 100% pay because more work on twitch side
[2:59:28] haseorogue2: i did hear that the process for drops was really hard to go through
[2:59:29] Arendo26: which serveer did you choose?
[2:59:30] Rottencoarse: dont forget the mining pick and BS hammer @Towelliee

[2:59:53] geokouts: hammer too
[2:59:57] Mecabeast: You can buy one on ah but prob better to make your own
[3:00:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some smaller games do a ton of drops, it can't be that expensive
[3:00:06] OGGrimReaperr: You need the BS hammer
[3:00:08] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  you need BS hammer as well for engi

[3:04:40] Ribbwich: pvp
[3:04:53] Yagr6: i feel like people dont want wow 2 bc they will lose all their achievements and mogs of 20 years

[3:06:27] Yagr6: @AlphasaurusRexx yea i feel yea, retail has so many problem that a new game would fix
[3:06:38] captivate7: I did

[3:09:38] magemaster225: if they nuke the srath sverers it would make me mad
[3:09:39] Yagr6: waste of time and resources?
[3:09:40] Cody_Cayde: didnt we lose talent trees
[3:09:41] happyspot: I just wonder if they'll keep wotlk era servers
[3:10:04] Ribbwich: @ididntdoitfr haha Linus having lunch of Jeff Bezos is so chad
[3:10:08] unowncreature: They should release it with the dungeons as difficult as they were at cata launch.
[3:10:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: I still think they should relabel it "Classic Progression" and just going through all the expansions
[3:10:20] botscast: they might keep few wotlk servers up just because its wotlk
[3:10:33] AlphasaurusRexx: imo they should stop working on classic and use those resources to make retail better. class reworks need to start rolling out imo.
[3:10:43] ColdSnacks_: !death
[3:10:46] herzlustafir: if they put all the energy on more content retail it would be richer.. instead of classic, they shoudn´t look back so much we are going forward i mean.. why linger in the past?
[3:10:58] MrKryto: @AlphasaurusRexx true
[3:11:03] NobodybetterPat: they called everyones bluff lol
[3:11:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: TBC Classic was good and Wrath is still ramping up for ICC
[3:11:33] neftario105: is Towelliee going to bilzcon and stream it?
[3:11:33] Cody_Cayde: i guess i just dont see the need for cata.  azeroth landscape changed, not talent trees etc. if you want cata story line go see chromie.
[3:11:34] astanyx1: Why cant all classics excist ion the same world?
[3:11:35] mr_fuminica1122: when are you gonna buy shoulders irl?
[3:11:51] mavericks312: You haven’t played DF if you think retail doesn’t have content
[3:11:52] cripplious: @herzlustafir they started classic to bring back those who were playing private servers
[3:12:07] Wcvechten: now that dungeonfinder is coming classic I'd probably play it again lmao
[3:12:08] haseorogue2: the arena cheating with wotlk classic is nuts
[3:12:09] AlphasaurusRexx: i 100% skip any sort of classic media from content creators. shit is hella boring to watch
[3:12:16] NobodybetterPat: whatever brings in viewers
[3:12:18] ColdSnacks_: Did he die or just start?
[3:12:35] Ribbwich: @Towelliee if someone offered to tailor make you a suit of armor, what would it look like and would you wear it on stream?
[3:12:44] essadis: their heart says vanilla goat. their common sense says take the money
[3:12:46] Cody_Cayde: i want wotlk plus
[3:12:56] herzlustafir: @cripplious the amount of players doing that is that high?
[3:13:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: We are on Day 1 of the official hardcore servers for this channel
[3:13:25] cripplious: @herzlustafir I read it was a couple million
[3:13:29] neftario105: I was always working didn't have time to play wow back in the day I have time to play it when Draenor came out and I playing it non stop now Im a classic player and start playing retail but is not the same
[3:13:44] cripplious: armor is so heavy and hot to wear
[3:13:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Destiny 2 has a lot of great story and it looks awesome
[3:14:16] happyspot: I had like a 5 minute queue on pillager that's it
[3:14:18] Wcvechten: EU has a queu on stitches earlier
[3:14:19] essadis: most was 4 min. very smooth
[3:14:29] FerociouzMonk: eu was so full you couldnt even que to be in the que
[3:14:38] gfield2k: what server you on @Towelliee ?
[3:14:50] SoapGuy: there were a bunch of people on, i hink they are just prepaired this time
[3:14:51] Niksen_99: Yeah they added like 10 layers on each server
[3:14:51] unowncreature: I'm just waiting for Dragon flying in old zones now. Been doing nothing but Kalimdor cup until they take it away.
[3:14:52] essadis: someone got in and said "No queueu? deadgame!" lol
[3:14:54] AlphasaurusRexx: @wEiRdO_dUdE If they smooth out the new player experience the game would be insanely better. I love the concept of D2 but after coming back from a hiatus so much has changed with the subclasses
[3:14:58] Valcrone: Valcrone subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 10 month streak!

[3:15:41] ididntdoitfr: There are a lot of games I'd try out if I could get faster internet where I am. 32 hour download time for Destiny 2 rn
[3:15:45] herzlustafir: if u want to stay in classic pls do but dont give us 20 versions of it? classic is enough... we have already played thru that if you was here from the start and actually is a old school wow player.. been there done that... you even got them traveling in time in retail with that bullshit..

[3:45:27] Cairfaig: You need big bags to go to Westfall too
[3:45:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like how this addon shows the ranking of mobs in the tool tip thing, like how deadly they are
[3:45:29] nfernal_majesty: Good luck today man !! lego

[3:49:09] Eviltuna13: Why not use crusader on mobs first for extra holy damage?

[3:56:13] Crowargus: ppl will find something lol
[3:56:27] Nerendis: There have been SOOO many posts of, "where can i appeal"
[3:56:29] Trawkey: 99% of the ppl complaining will never reach 60 on hardcore anyways
[3:56:44] Eviltuna13: Another add on i  would suggest for new players is Vendor price
[3:57:00] RequiemBlitz: Warrior solo is hard regardless
[3:57:02] haseorogue2: yeah the good thing now though is you can group for it
[3:57:07] Sarcastic_Sara: Yeah I died to my power blinking last night but luckily I was only level 6 lol
[3:57:24] essadis: lvl 11 night elves dying to trying to tame a bear because they get swiped on their feet then the bear kills them lol
[3:57:30] haseorogue2: same for me but i was 28
[3:57:36] Nerendis: Honestly the solo self found is why I never tried HC. Maybe I should play the servers.
[3:57:40] Connectus: Could be worse
[3:57:49] Connectus: Dying because u used bloodrage as a warrior when you barely have HP left Kappa
[3:58:03] RequiemBlitz: I only group for two quests. My lv 10 warlock quest and the Dark Shore Mech. I still soloed Princess and Hogger

[4:21:39] Timothious: that hunter would probably like them
[4:21:43] LearnedSomething: find a dwarf hunter and make his day??
[4:22:06] MykeCA: @Gaddrael So make the new game even more bloated?

[4:24:24] weber510: @MykeCA The people calling for WoW 2 are the ones that LOVE classic and wish for a new game that progresses like Classic didn't.
[4:24:45] MykeCA: @weber510 that's why there's Classic servers?

[4:25:28] MykeCA: to be fair, he coudln't have known you had mining
[4:25:57] ChiefRatchet: What if they are making a new expansion where Gammon becomes warchief?
[4:26:06] Timothious: he could have waited to see
[4:26:17] Gaddrael: Remember to go holy first for that 70% heal pushback chance lol
[4:26:43] MykeCA: @weber510 And new content could be added to Classic+. There's already a working frame work. Zero reason to ditch that frame work for a new one that wouldn't be proven to be better than the current one. It's just not a financially responsible move.
[4:27:00] kickassassins: Maybe Towelliee should be war chief

[4:29:16] essadis: the problem with new MMOs is that there will always be a "first  love" to combat
[4:29:19] NineSeven8: I believe RIOT MMO is going to be a long living game with a huge comunity
[4:29:23] avarose8910: Awww this is so sad, asterisk sniff asterisk
[4:29:33] Metket: riot fanboi detected
[4:29:36] Timothious: lol they didn't do the actually cry

[4:30:23] Syllvn: I thinik Riots will end up more like Genshin
[4:30:43] NineSeven8: The thing is I would start playing RIOTs MMO but not WoW at this point, WoW feels to big of a game to pick up
[4:30:53] Murlocz: What actually makes WoW special for me is the combat tbh
[4:31:20] BoogieDuck: My turn for the hurricane
[4:31:47] sakucee: Need SWG Remaster

[4:31:59] slippykoi: I'm just praying for bdo style combat
[4:32:12] Syllvn: I think they will want to lean into the characters they have already, rather than custom characters which will turn a lot of MMO folks away
[4:32:22] neftario105: @Towelliee is there will be a MMO thats going to be more popular than wow?

[4:33:47] Wcvechten: we return to the shadowlands to bring the covenants to Azeroth!
[4:33:47] Murlocz: Retail now is in a better position than Legion was? Damn
[4:33:48] Alsparq: @Towelliee has any other game made a bigger impact on the industry than wow in your opinion?
[4:34:03] Syllvn: No other MMO will surpass WoW because there are simply too many games out there now.
[4:34:09] Metket: they can still f up something like jailer KEKW
[4:34:10] MykeCA: @brickskwuadd Warlock is one of the most survival classes
[4:34:24] brickskwuadd: legion was the best expansion for me.. so fun
[4:34:24] einself111: Better position but way less players

[4:34:30] YeahImJordan: People forget that the casual player is what keeps WoW running, not the hardcore player
[4:34:30] TheGiant99: There is just no reason to play wow most of the time.
[4:34:31] MykeCA: @Metket Shadowlands itself was just a big fuck up
[4:34:44] NineSeven8: Well but on the other end is Microsoft now, it's like Disney and Star Wars, for WoW fans hope not

[4:34:57] MykeCA: @YeahImJordan and what's your definition of casual?
[4:35:00] CriticalPhil: OMFG my hunter just died doing Murkdeep quest in darkshore
[4:35:03] Murlocz: @towelliee Ive heard someone that its always one bad expansion followed by a good one
[4:35:15] ChiefRatchet: To me regardless of content, the problem with retail is the whole mythic
[4:35:27] MykeCA: @Metket Story has been better, so I don't see the story being fucked up again
[4:35:28] Mecabeast: Game is set up now where casuals can feel like they beat the game and can stop playing till the next patch
[4:35:39] YeahImJordan: @YeahImJordan couple times a week, doesnt have a hardcore raiding guild or really plays them outside of lfr, that type
[4:35:45] Exxcar: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP

[4:36:45] TheGiant99: Retail just seems boring right now with not much reason to play
[4:36:47] devoted_bee: barbWOAH
[4:36:57] PadidinJones: its a tarp
[4:37:01] ChiefRatchet: I'll never forget when WoW first came out, how badly people wanted to compete to get certain armors or weapons, thats all lost in retail. Judgment set is a great example
[4:37:05] Metket: oh sheet i just realized towelliee soon titles LUL what does he know this time
[4:37:16] MykeCA: @Murlocz Good with issues != bad. Shadowlands, was bad. SLands was the only real true bad expansion. WoD was half way good until it wasn't.
[4:37:25] destrophic: I haven't touched the New expansion yet LUL
[4:37:42] valianya: Its healthier for the game to not try to force players to constantly keep playing
[4:37:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm sure they do want to dial it back
[4:38:13] MykeCA: Look at all that skinning profit
[4:38:28] Exxcar: @Towelliee Semiglutide working for you? Thinking about it
[4:38:31] Murlocz: @mykeca shadowlands made me quit WoW 4ever lmao, maybe cuz i was so hyped and the frustration was huge
[4:38:37] ChiefRatchet: right the cadence is set towards quarterly earnings reports etc.
[4:38:56] einself111: the remaining playerbase
[4:39:02] xmedpakx: very true
[4:39:09] CeruleanStar: i wouldn't go so far as to call them genius' -- the fan base has been bitching about this for years and it took blizz 3 xpacs to figure it out lol
[4:39:41] CeruleanStar: lol yeah that's fir
[4:39:44] CeruleanStar: *fair
[4:39:44] MykeCA: @CeruleanStar at least blizz figured it out. Other MMOS died cause they couldn't figure it out.
[4:39:54] destrophic: @CeruleanStar yeah truuue and now Im itching to come back LUL
[4:40:16] CeruleanStar: work/life balance is real for everything people do - even mmo's
[4:40:17] MykeCA: my raid group has been done H.Sark for the last month LUL
[4:40:37] Metket: season 1 was good, and season 2 aug happened LUL
[4:40:48] Wcvechten: to casuals 10s are probably hard

[4:42:08] Thoreya: only thing i have with the gearing system is that it makes not so good players overgeard for keys that they shud not be doing
[4:42:12] Thoreya: bc its whatever

[5:12:39] vimie: NW is a box game tho. Having people playing was already a win. Different for LA & F2P
[5:12:49] Nebulizer87: the best part is the fresh start will be flooded with bots all over again
[5:12:56] RhadigarTV: Wait. Fresh start servers again in New World?
[5:12:57] Nebulizer87: LA is better but its still shit lol

[5:14:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah most players want to be on the mega server
[5:14:59] Nuclearthyme: they havent done any mergers in a while. i think theyre holding off cause the first major expansion is coming in like a month
[5:15:14] sakucee: Oh no, D2 loadouts are down, well luckily i had my buster suspend nade + malfeasance build on which works for anything basically.
[5:15:15] Nebulizer87: i won't ever understand how you make a newer mmo and don't just  shard it
[5:15:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: OPR is region-wide, but that's it right now. They are working on making arena and expeditions work region-wide, too
[5:15:17] Metket: paid one?
[5:15:26] DunzoCD: yeah they are raising item level cap

[5:15:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: In New World, the current season ends in about 35 days. No word on the expansion date yet
[5:16:05] Nuclearthyme: no its just season 3
[5:16:24] RhadigarTV: @Towelliee They haven't announced anything. Season 2 hasn't even ended yet.

[7:25:45] HaloS23: @Towelliee Maybe a stupid question but, does origin PCs come with extra software loaded like a computer you buy from stores?
[7:25:54] Molvonos: I did, lol
[7:26:17] Awarain: i look at it and realize it's not being used and get sad.
[7:26:18] flookguy: It’s not twitter it’s X. Lol
[7:26:26] Molvonos: Yea, I can do it, as long as I know what you're doing.  And it shows up in the same area as your new Featured Clips, so
[7:26:29] Molvonos: It's still Twitter.
[7:26:32] HaloS23: cool!
[7:26:43] Molvonos: If I can type in Twitter.com and it still comes up, it's Twitter.
[7:26:44] tehrobtar: god that's been me... i've been wanting to get into baldur's gate.. but like.. i got that hc itch rofl
[7:26:55] flookguy: The only origin software preloaded is the one to control your performance

[7:27:50] Phoxzy: @Noshpan Yeah greapfruit, ginger, pomegranate, turmeric, green tea, etc. They all increase the effectiveness of the medication, grapefruit can intensify medicines by double.
[7:28:04] Molvonos: https://i.imgur.com/zgv8uB2.jpg

[7:30:08] MrWaka27: I did my own, I only had issues when building it.
[7:30:53] IlionDK: tune
[7:31:26] Molvonos: I'd say, if the cost is compariable, I'd rather not build my rig, for reasons stated.  I built this one, but I didn't have any issues and at the time, my job wasn't reliant on it.
[7:32:05] toobaked1987: Towelliee you leveling like a boss bro! ez 60
[7:32:17] Phoxzy: Im consider buying that new Corsair desk that showed off at Gamescom
[7:32:53] mc_spanky_: Building a PC is easier then ever with all the resources available to us. Origin isn’t that great at all
