[0:23:36] infernion: I always said dh destro should never lose to RLS
[0:23:37] holyskyler: I think it comes down to comp choices in critical moments and maybe talent choices
[0:23:37] unclegrove: Lontar did great guys, stop hate
[0:23:39] infernion: Ye watched
[0:23:44] mrjaiem: all who say if it was mehh today echo will win go play another game

[0:23:54] Bassist12: mehh is way more mechanical
[0:23:55] remmixx: @Whaazz  why was Chan doing way less dmg that Merce ? honest question, no troll
[0:23:56] infernion: The only game you won in the great finals was cuz Merce was playing howl of terror over coil? Wonder if that was a mistake wtf
[0:23:58] yaaggaaa: whaazz would dragging Limps in the open and slowing him not work?
[0:24:02] infernion: Ye outlaw does nothing until damp
[0:24:02] aitosoosi: no one haye
[0:24:09] unluckythen: dh is doubling ur damage

[0:24:47] ownagekitty: I missed echo playing ?
[0:24:51] ownagekitty: noooo
[0:24:52] bobthegoblin_: Lontar did 30% more healing almost every game
[0:24:55] Cokeboii: @bobthegoblin_ Merce did it, so why can he ?
[0:24:57] wardelswijk: feels like you just got outpved by the DH / destro
[0:25:03] bobthegoblin_: @Cokeboii Whazz explained it 10 times
[0:25:07] mokeysoe: @ownagekitty you can rewatch it on youtube
[0:25:10] Elannar: Whazz, love you bro. Unfortunate in the finals. You're still the best.
[0:25:27] voygard: yeaits always like that
[0:25:28] ownagekitty: trying to find it
[0:25:31] Balthizaar: It's unfortunate because they see the only variable that changed and they assume that's it
[0:25:34] truhan89: do u think rmd is bad or u guys could be much better on it?
[0:25:40] mumleon_: its the solo shuffle, made people more toxic in arena LUL
[0:25:41] infernion: They should really fix so details doesn't show earthen wall damage on 1 team if they're gonna show details on broadcast KEKW
[0:25:43] Atte0825: who bring the idea to play dh in last game?
[0:25:45] Gingtko: Gingtko subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 4 month streak! whaazzPoggers  wp today, insane series
[0:25:46] ChuckBorrisSVK: Its the usual wow mentality to blame healer first :D
[0:25:46] ownagekitty: who won eu?
[0:25:47] AstralScare: Lontar was insane yep
[0:25:50] mrjaiem: lontar saved the games many many time he did insane job sorry for chan he is a very very good players but its was lock diff !!!
[0:25:59] TheRatPresident: the majority of people who watch WoW pvp have no clue what they are talking about, so they jump to the easiest conclusions they can find, such as "they lost becaue no mehh"
[0:25:59] runnnnnit: your threw caue you didnt go frost dk
[0:26:13] askamar1234: @Whaazz did Lontar dispel immolate compare to other shamman?
[0:26:14] venyoxlol: mythic plus in awc kekw; by the way what did you think of the last game / the mirror? ggs
[0:26:17] kalynwow: @mrjaiem supportaire de lontar
[0:26:17] unluckythen: eu is going crazy when echo isnt dominating
[0:26:22] unluckythen: its so funny to watch the chat 😂
[0:26:23] goldenpharmy: maybe the onlny bad move of lontar was, when he ran swtich pillar and ran to the port and tb from the lock :S
[0:26:26] bobthegoblin_: @TheRatPresident actually this, when Supa was trash talking Lontar entire chat was following what he said
[0:26:27] Esotraz: Whaazz dh would have pumped more
[0:26:36] goldenpharmy: much love at lontar
[0:26:40] mrjaiem: @kalynwow pas du tout je suis supporter de hayne
[0:27:00] infernion: I swear Merce must've picked wrong spec this game lol
[0:27:06] Ceribi: lontar played amazing. mercedesa gap is what decided it
[0:27:19] AstralScare: Merce played insane in the series though
[0:27:20] bobthegoblin_: there was no lock gap
[0:27:34] art_CH: How come merce was always doing 30-40% more dmg?
[0:27:41] infernion: @AstralScare They both played good ye
[0:28:20] infernion: Did he kick after cast LOL
[0:28:26] bobthegoblin_: @art_CH DH immolate dispel and details bugged tracking
[0:28:33] yaaggaaa: @whaazz why didnt u pick mugumbala for better ports from chanimal, wouldn’t Limps do less dmg then?
[0:28:37] dankgamer97: Why did you guys always go RMD after winning vs fuston as RLS  in semi finals ? Was so confused PepoThink
[0:28:43] Chanx: he had kick at the end of my cast
[0:28:44] slickdaddyg69: merce didnt do any noticible pls dont compare him to chan chan > merce
[0:28:44] Chanx: so he was spamming
[0:28:46] art_CH: @bobthegoblin_ I see make sense if true
[0:29:10] Barradoso: does limps streams?
[0:29:15] venyoxlol: sub makes sense tho because chan got stopped on fear cast when you stun shaman
[0:29:15] infernion: Swear assa destro shits on this?
[0:29:25] Sillken: this Le Pomp team is a Korean team right? like 3/4 Korean and 1 russian
[0:29:29] aitosoosi: hahaaha
[0:29:34] dusttiy: maybe they win cuz they have shadowmourne equipped Kappa
[0:29:34] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[0:29:35] art_CH: @Whaazz  Yes someone else answered it, thanks.

[0:30:08] Esotraz: @chanx darthchan better winrate than raiku dh?
[0:30:13] sirius_sx: You should Play dh instead of raiku

[0:32:00] Esotraz: Fuseton is also rather new to healer main no?
[0:32:01] Raikubest: If i played same talents as limps we would of won last game im 90% sure but we would just lose to dh war next game
[0:32:02] Ceribi: l1mps is the best warrior but he has played nonstop dh and is insane
[0:32:03] voygard: nha, rn dh does + dmg, u cant outdmg it

[0:33:10] lmaoerss: remove shadowy duel and its fine
[0:33:13] infernion: The problem with sub rogue is no one good plays it. If a demon hunter main would attempt sub rogue, it'd be over for everyone. Rogue players just can't make rogue work, but a demon hunter main would roll everyone on sub (cuz it's crazy OP)
[0:33:18] venyoxlol: yup
[0:33:24] Blumee9: Supatease is the biggest sub hater
[0:33:26] Esotraz: Id be Happy if rogue was unplayable

[0:33:44] Dexlol123: need to play sub howton style
[0:33:45] TheRatPresident: supa focuses much more on speaking fast than saying something that makes sense - he knows the audience wont be able to tell the difference
[0:33:45] mysticalmoun: sorry but disagree
[0:33:46] ownagekitty: it's annoying me
[0:33:59] bobthegoblin_: Raiku shadow priest wouldve sent them
[0:34:02] asdkl2312k3o: @Raikubest dont u lose dmg if u play 2x immolate and dispel?
[0:34:05] ganaken_: @Whaazz gargle with warm water with salt 3 times you will feel fine

[0:34:27] pleebiceps: @Whaazz Hows the team moral after the L ?
[0:34:29] xHeythemops: @Raikubest yeah bro immolation aura build too op more dispells of immolates on yourself so lock does less dmg. it might be better than reverse magic
[0:34:31] Atte0825: before games, do you pick comps blindly or can you check broadcast ?
[0:34:33] Raikubest: @asdkl2312k3o nah not rly i play this build the most tbh

[0:35:32] brokolichen: stergeCheers
[0:35:36] Ceribi: then they play dh war next game and roll yall tbh
[0:35:37] ownagekitty: I feel sorry for lontar he did great, but maybe a lot wanting meh back

[0:45:10] GaryNec: JUST PRESS W ON DH AND WIN

[0:45:48] bobthegoblin_: @Martem98 no. ppl want the game to be fresh
[0:45:52] calloomi: just play dh lmao
[0:45:54] naughtynurse123: they fucked with the game to much , we are so deep down this new retail style of pvp that we cant ever go back to say wod or mop days where game made sense
[0:45:54] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Whaazz

[0:46:12] asdkl2312k3o: u didnt lose to mana though
[0:46:20] Bonquieshaa: mop classic wouold be fun for a little bit until everyone gets farmed by meta
[0:46:22] bartek8003: yoo, ggs on the cup broski. nice dh dmg, everyone cries about rog btw
[0:46:23] Raikubest: Rogue mage is weird because idk if holypriest would work but ur like lacking dmg
[0:46:26] yaaggaaa: retail is fine, the game is evolving and that make much more sense
[0:46:27] ownagekitty: Did I hear earlier they will nerf sub rogue dmg again?
[0:46:37] TheVezir: @Martem98 yep 1000%
[0:46:38] Ceribi: what was the difference in the rls games in the lower bracket compared to the finals were they playing immo dispell in the lower bracket games @Whaazz
[0:46:47] linuswarlock: bro echo raiku thumbs down tweet gets me every time idk why KEKW
[0:46:48] surprizeyatwo: Meh would have done the missing dmg for rm Kappa
[0:46:52] Martem98: @bobthegoblin_  i think ppl prefere good gameplay to fresh gameplay
[0:46:58] lmaoerss: they hate on DH harder
[0:47:05] 00ZZEE: Rogues are the ADC of wow, no matter how strong they are they are gonna underplay it
[0:47:16] voygard: and MS
[0:47:18] voygard: KEKW
[0:47:18] asdkl2312k3o: no dh in na though
[0:47:18] victorpayne: removing DH from the game would be a smart move for the future of wow's pvp!
[0:47:19] bobthegoblin_: @Martem98 WOTLK will show u thats not true, it needs to be good and fresh
[0:47:19] Esotraz: Dh blind is 3 sec
[0:47:20] yaaggaaa: why not play feral?
[0:47:25] bartek8003: ayo im low rated player, yet still I see dh as an abomination, best rog ever has been but better
[0:47:27] Raikubest: and they stilll dont kill? @howtobasicmd and i talked to kubzy, he said if u face destro warlock u cant win (thats why they played WW dh into RLD last week and not RMD)
[0:47:29] KrisuMusic: DH has a lot in their toolkit. If it only had damage, it would be boring. Its a crazy spec now
[0:47:32] vengiitv: What about DH Def comolll
[0:47:35] Axl_Rose94: @Esotraz isnt dh stun like 3 secs too?
[0:47:40] Ackisen: @yaaggaaa prob one of the worst specs ingame rn
[0:47:41] ownagekitty: Feral has bad survivability.
[0:47:54] ngage44: if you are low rating and you hate Rogue over DH/Warr you are stupid af
[0:47:59] camgirlxo: LUL
[0:48:00] holyskyler: the thing is that fuseton can only improve as it’s an alt
[0:48:00] Martem98: @bobthegoblin_ ok, but mop pvp was a lot better and closer to the systems we have today compared to wrath pvp
[0:48:02] KrisuMusic: dh def is very solid, immunity, dodge, glimpse immuine, darkness
[0:48:05] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz is NA trolling not plaing DH?
[0:48:07] Ceribi: infy said it a while ago dh destro best comp
[0:48:14] IIyena: just need to fix blur 80% omnidirectional dodge and reduce some magic dmg reduction. Class should be a bit squishier to force it to kite more. which in return makes it create less pressure.
[0:48:15] bobthegoblin_: @Martem98 ofc but an old expac will never suceed again
[0:48:17] FunkOGtv: Im voting for Whaazz to be a commentator for the games now :D

[0:52:43] infernion: Lowkey curious if double dh rsham would beat dh destro rsham for free
[0:52:50] asdkl2312k3o: why not dh/outlaw? @Whaazz
[0:52:57] Deathmarkedx: i swear double DH might actually be a cracked comp

[1:01:49] johnnyathans: @raikubest What is the reason?
[1:02:01] whittyxo: thoughts on cross region this year? :o
[1:02:01] Raikubest: The reason is for the ppl who live on the west coast its obviously unfair xD
[1:02:13] calloomi: why cant they change server between matches
[1:02:15] johnnyathans: So they handicap everyone
[1:02:16] EFFSIN: lol
[1:02:17] heroo24: the blizzard i know, the reason would be the west coast location is cheaper LUL
[1:02:28] Bonquieshaa: yes
[1:02:29] Raikubest: It's logic tho right
[1:02:30] gm0re: Did Prev and Brain not qualify this season? or didnt they play?
[1:02:31] Ceribi: apparantley exzistence only landed 3 kicks in all the games against move. the ping is insane

[1:02:40] whittyxo: @gm0re brain retired
[1:02:47] Bonquieshaa: best ping you get on east coast is like 20-50ms
[1:02:52] Bonquieshaa: west coast you can play 5ping
[1:02:56] luigicnh: I live in brazil and play with 130 ping. That is really unfair lol
[1:03:05] Raikubest: East coast (middle) u get like 50-60 to West coast and u get 70-80 to Europe, West coast to west coast like 15 ping, west coast to europe like 180
[1:03:12] Raikubest: and europe to west coast the same
[1:03:16] Ceribi: if prev brain and drake still played na wouldnt beas  competitive as it is now. they would just slam everyone
[1:03:23] alegpetrovich: but u move to NA whaaz

[1:03:36] Raikubest: like this
[1:03:44] deathmodeWOW: Why is there no lan?
[1:03:45] Raikubest: but if u live on the east coast u obviously have the biggest chance to win
[1:03:47] whittyxo: broooo lans now with all these teams would be so much fun
[1:03:49] luigicnh: Yeah, you are right. Blizzard does not even have servers in south america, did you know? We play in a server located in Chicago (!).
[1:03:52] halbinder: they should play with home and away matches like in football ucl lol. one game on na server, next game on eu
