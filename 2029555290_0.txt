[3:00:02] zachl_: @jambo_the_nerd it converts all damage that arent chaos to chaos then buffs ur chaos dam
[3:00:07] zachl_: like any means neccesary or smth
[3:01:02] zachl_: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388114/any-means-necessary
[3:01:13] buzzkill00: the hunt and elysian decree have not been whitelisted for havoc's mastery as of now
[3:01:34] zeph_6: any means nescessary doesnt buff chaos dmg iirc, it only buffs the dms that is converted to chaos dmg
[3:01:39] zeph_6: the chaos dmg you naturally do is not buffed by it
[3:01:42] zachl_: o
[3:01:45] zachl_: real
[3:01:49] jambo_the_nerd: oh ok @zachl_ i was wondering if the 10.2.5 conversion to chaos damage for both spells would be a sort of buff
[3:01:49] zeph_6: pretty sure yeah
[3:01:51] buzzkill00: @zeph_6 you are correct sir
[3:01:59] KaladinHS: need more gorgers
[3:02:15] buzzkill00: @jambo_the_nerd nope so far nothing changes it's just visual
[3:02:48] buzzkill00: green rocket instead of blue rocket
[3:02:51] jambo_the_nerd: i dont even play dh i was curious lol, similarly rogue's echoing reprimand is being changed to physical damage
[3:02:53] KaladinHS: thriple gorger
[3:02:56] KaladinHS: thats a wipe
[3:02:56] zeph_6: i liked the blue rocket more!!!!
[3:03:01] zeph_6: i hate that vomit green on the new hunt
[3:03:17] zachl_: i think they missed with all the cov ability animations tbh
[3:03:19] buzzkill00: green rocket goes kinda hard dude
[3:03:28] zachl_: like every change sucks
[3:03:37] zeph_6: i was hoping we would be able to choose but bluepost says its coming in the future
[3:03:37] KaladinHS: this def gonna wipe
[3:03:39] buzzkill00: I disagree I love the new hunt
[3:03:40] zeph_6: night fae hunt goes omega hard
[3:03:44] zachl_: i dont even play paladin rn and im mad they removed the bell sound from toll
[3:03:57] jenkinsdonuttv: One time I got stuck in this room pulling trash because I closed the door behind me by accident monkaS
[3:04:00] buzzkill00: and the faeline stomp for monks is also pretty dope
[3:04:07] buzzkill00: the new one that is
[3:04:11] KaladinHS: is the tank doing 900ik?
[3:04:20] zachl_: the only one i think is okay is convoke
[3:04:24] zachl_: the rest of the changes are beans
[3:04:28] jambo_the_nerd: are they changing it in 10.2.5 or its already changed? @zachl_ ive been playing paladin since bfa and i never really remember the spell sounds lol
[3:04:30] zeph_6: i'm okay with the new elysian decree
[3:04:34] zeph_6: its mainly hunt one i dont like
[3:04:34] jenkinsdonuttv: I like the champion's spear animation
[3:04:44] oevrit: stomp looks sick
[3:04:49] juno_sha: All the new changes are better than before Pog
[3:04:54] zeph_6: @jambo_the_nerd next weekly reset
[3:04:54] buzzkill00: @jambo_the_nerd it's changing next reset not yet
[3:04:55] NeverRetail: Hey chat, dumb question, but whats the ability he does after fracture.
[3:05:07] juno_sha: Spirit Bomb
[3:05:16] mk__9: the new monk faeline looks cool
[3:05:16] zachl_: next reset but still
[3:05:18] Owaristreams: no calcified spikes?
[3:05:18] zachl_: divine toll
[3:05:19] jambo_the_nerd: ok thanks, im gonna have to listen to it today and then try to remember the sound next week when i hear the new sound lol
[3:05:21] zachl_: legendary sound
[3:05:28] zachl_: its gonna be so sad when its gone
[3:05:32] juno_sha: Paladins are dumb, so who cares PepeLa
[3:05:34] CrackedOrb: get meat fury'd
[3:05:35] zachl_: like idk divine toll bell is soooo iconic
[3:05:37] jenkinsdonuttv: Gokuhavoc does spirit bomb
[3:05:45] FrostmagicED: I hope
[3:05:47] mk__9: paladins are shamans at home baseg
[3:05:50] FrostmagicED: they add glyphs for old animations
[3:05:51] oevrit: any wa for toll bell
[3:05:54] buzzkill00: divine toll suited paladins from the get go it didnt need changes at all
[3:05:54] juno_sha: Shamans are dumb too
[3:06:01] juno_sha: Delete them so I can be happy
[3:06:07] zeph_6: divine toll change is criminal
[3:06:21] MierkaBlue: @zeph_6 agreed
[3:06:22] zeph_6: but fuck paladins ezz
[3:06:23] zachl_: adaptive swarm change is criminal too
[3:06:24] zachl_: omg
[3:06:24] mk__9: juno u should just play the good kinda shaman
[3:06:27] zachl_: worst shit ever
[3:06:27] mk__9: then u will be happy
[3:06:35] juno_sha: No melee shaman Madge

[6:27:27] norkibit: @Aggroboy and how do they compare in terms of difficulty? prot pala and vdh
[6:27:29] keyboard94: Just Elle
[6:27:35] ZevisAu: I havent been able to see many streamers play it.
[6:27:39] maacfroza_: how do you change the abilites being tracked by omni cd? right now i have yours thats in the custom 1 and 2

[6:27:56] Ale2104: Dorki, how to pronounce LiuLiou? Lil' Lil'? Lil' Liúo?
[6:28:11] yyllaaa: liu liu o

[6:29:53] chiefwakka: The camera in DHT is tough with the trees
[6:29:54] greathasher: At this point
[6:29:58] Aggroboy: VDH isn't getting nerfed at this point, the meta is kinda set

[6:37:25] pandamclootin: @greathasher i see! i played last season, and remember i pressed it quite often!
[6:37:33] WolfSuzume: infernal strike in only movement u should never use it for dmg as any other global u do help u do more dmg and live

[6:47:18] Sinneerrzz: Do you always run 2 x BSL on boomy now?
[6:47:38] juno_sha: What if you healer sucks
[6:47:40] ToxicTomek: If this is my first time playing VDH do you have the same tankyness like prot pala?
[6:47:44] juno_sha: and you stay below 90
[6:47:48] ToxicTomek: can I have bigdick to just walk into giant packs?
[6:47:50] Sinneerrzz: What about your phial for M+ as boomy?
[6:47:53] EroyJ: Hey man is the WA for cc available for public?
[6:48:24] EroyJ: the aoe stops
[6:48:48] Aggroboy: VDH is just far tankier than ProtPal
[6:48:49] omerm98: how much uptime do you normally get on immo aura and spikes? i cant seem to get more then like 50/60% even with 1 point into ftd
[6:48:52] lorexssen: Ayo @dorki , is there a way to make colors in your season 3 plater profile more bright?
[6:49:06] Sinneerrzz: For the 2 x BSL setup, would you sacrific your bracers (489) for crafted as lower stat piece?
[6:49:09] ToxicTomek: @Aggroboy I tried fresh out of ah gear on a key 7 sometimes my hp just goes 100-0
[6:49:19] ToxicTomek: I guess its tankier just need more focus on spell combos?
[6:49:37] juno_sha: toes?
[6:49:39] Sinneerrzz: Thanks
[6:49:45] Triplehelixqt: hi dorki. is healer streaming?
[6:49:54] Aggroboy: i mean you gotta do some basic gearing, e.g. fly around for whelplings, craft some stuff, do the dreamzone quests
[6:49:56] Chmielu35: Can u show EB route?
[6:50:12] omerm98: are toxic boots inting in veng spec? my 1st crafts went into havoc st/aoe and i dunno wether to use normal crit/haste boots or toxic in tank spec
[6:50:25] bschs1: the healers streams?
[6:50:28] yyllaaa: whats the の at middle for
[6:50:34] ederhammett: @dorki you suck but i like you
[6:50:37] rockosmodernwaifu: rockosmodernwaifu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! council might be one of the worst designed fights of all time.
[6:50:39] Berriesqt: Hi Dorki. quick Q for u: how do you guys measure how much an aug evoker is contributing towards your dps in a key? Ive seen recounts where u see a seperate section that shows the aug dps in an odd way. but how do you exactly measure it?
[6:50:41] ToxicTomek: @Aggroboy After my main got 20 renown etc all my alts are just 11s/17s keys spam nothing else KEKW
[6:50:55] leifjw: i mean if you are havoc you probs want 2x bsl anyways
[6:51:04] LazyL1on: @dorki do you do skip to sol now?
[6:51:09] bschs1: @dorki does the healer streams?
[6:51:15] ToxicTomek: @bschs1 Nope
[6:51:20] bschs1: :(
[6:51:24] LifeofSlayer77: :(
[6:51:31] yyllaaa: do you also wear the same sunglasses when u game
[6:51:48] Aggroboy: @ToxicTomek yeah i got all portals on main and stopped after a long streak of bad vaults, now gearing an alt
[6:52:10] ToxicTomek: @Aggroboy 5 weeks in a row im getting rawdogged by vaults
[6:52:17] ToxicTomek: in 5 weeks my main got +1 ilvl
[6:52:19] ToxicTomek: 485 now
[6:52:54] ederhammett: mage melted abomb
[6:53:19] NattyPally: would you say bdk or monk is worse
[6:53:21] juno_sha: BOP
[6:53:29] Aggroboy: brew is worse
[6:53:49] ToxicTomek: Brew/Guardian is probably worst tanks atm
[6:53:53] NattyPally: @Aggroboy :(
[6:54:00] Aggroboy: at least with BDK you can screw the team and press W
[6:54:05] HarveyPls: wtfwtfwtf
[6:54:07] ToxicTomek: KEKW
[6:54:17] Aggroboy: and leggo, don't forget the buffed leggo
[6:54:21] ToxicTomek: BDK solo boss 80% hp easy job
[6:54:21] bynryan18: at least us brews are drunk 24/7
[6:54:29] jambo_the_nerd: the only tank not in the top 40 of io is a bdk btw
[6:54:44] jambo_the_nerd: kind of interesting to see not just prot paladin and vdh
[6:54:49] ToxicTomek: Cause bdk cant do really 27ish+
[6:55:00] jambo_the_nerd: like 2 brews, 3-4 bears and i think 2 warriors
[6:55:00] ToxicTomek: But under that BDK slaps anything not VDH/Pala
[6:55:25] ToxicTomek: But how many people in the chat does 27/28s anyway honestly
[6:55:39] gretriku: all of us how dare you
[6:55:40] jambo_the_nerd: idk, im doing them now but im prot paladin
[6:55:42] tmevil_: all of us :)
[6:55:49] Aggroboy: BDK so you can enjoy the sick leggo
[6:55:58] warlord1515: @ToxicTomek this is not true
[6:56:05] warlord1515: i did 27 eb on my bdk today
[6:56:05] K4lsdern: go protpal with leggo
[6:56:06] K4lsdern: trust
[6:56:09] jambo_the_nerd: wait i thought no one here was doing 27s because you guys are all doing 33-25s?
[6:56:09] chrono_za: doesnt lego stun you LUL
[6:56:10] warlord1515: no leggo
[6:56:12] jambo_the_nerd: 335*
[6:56:15] jambo_the_nerd: 35* fuck
[6:56:38] Metapong: hooooly that darkness
[6:56:40] ToxicTomek: @warlord1515 Wazodk said it on stream that BDK caps on 27/28 ish
[6:56:40] Sohen: the gap for BDK isn't really survivability (i mean it kinda is compared to meta tanks) but their lack of utility for m+
[6:56:44] ToxicTomek: cause after that BDK gets oneshotted perma
[6:56:55] Sohen: also its literally impossible to recover from dying as a bdk in high keys
[6:56:59] Sohen: where other tanks don't have that problem
[6:57:07] ToxicTomek: Like you got sick healing but you cant heal 100-0 back Sadge
[6:57:17] jambo_the_nerd: i wonder where s3 SL bdk would rank in the current season
[6:57:34] jambo_the_nerd: and then also s2 DF bear
[6:57:37] Sohen: i feel like the reason tank meta is the way it is this season isn't really anything other than utility
[6:57:42] Sohen: there is so much shit to kick in these dungeons
[6:57:55] ToxicTomek: +
[6:57:56] Sohen: silence sigil and bell and avenger shield just too much value in these keys
[6:58:00] warlord1515: @ToxicTomek thats probably true for now but theres alot of season left just have to find what works
[6:58:23] ToxicTomek: Well the solution is to play Pala/DH and you good Sadge
[6:58:24] warlord1515: but watching dh this shit is insane
[6:58:32] Sohen: DH actually makes keys 10x easier
[6:58:43] Sohen: also the class does insane damage and its super easy to live on
[6:58:45] Aggroboy: yeah VDH makes PUG keys so much easier
[6:58:49] chrono_za: look at vdh dmg LMAO
[6:58:57] ToxicTomek: VDH probably make any key easier
[6:59:01] ToxicTomek: The control of mobs is just insane
[6:59:02] jambo_the_nerd: that would actually be such a cool video series to watch each season, some m+ big brains get together and just speculate "with the current season, what would be meta specs from all previous seasons of m+ vs the current meta"
[6:59:10] Volun_: TANK?
[6:59:22] notSean1992: @Sohen yeah certain pulls on VDH with sigil of silence, misery etc is just so easy compared to trying it on almost any other tank
[6:59:40] Aggroboy: add an Oppressive Roar on top of it... VDH just owns
[7:00:06] Sohen: I found once you hit 25's as a bdk and the one shot bolts and casts start coming in that it just gimps your group super hard
[7:00:15] Sohen: especially in dungeons with elites that cast like black rook and waycrest
[7:00:23] Sohen: cause you literally can't do shit about those as a bdk
[7:00:39] Aggroboy: yeah but at that point, brew also gets deleted
[7:00:52] jambo_the_nerd: except brew is a top 40 tank
[7:01:09] deanw0w69: TANK?
[7:01:11] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Madge
[7:01:15] Lycanus4: TANK? 󠀀
[7:01:20] Sohen: there is some insane brewmasters out there like equinox but for the most part the spec just dies lol
[7:01:22] ShyneKnight: bro?
[7:01:22] ederhammett: DH SKIN
[7:01:25] notSean1992: I think once you go above 25 you generally want to have a group anyway
[7:01:31] chrono_za: donki my tank Despairge
[7:01:41] Aggroboy: even Equinox's HP is a constant 100-0 yo-yo
[7:01:55] twuistx: why dont you go double cheath
[7:01:58] jambo_the_nerd: @Aggroboy constant yo-yo isnt dying though
[7:02:18] Aggroboy: oh yeah he died too
[7:02:21] greathasher: They probably need the dmg at this level twuistx
[7:02:21] jambo_the_nerd: @notSean1992 im no voice pugging all 26s now working on more 27s
[7:02:25] Celestial990: bdk needs redesign Sadge
[7:02:49] WolfSuzume: bdk is made for raid and not dungeons Shruge
[7:02:56] jambo_the_nerd: bdk needs gavel + s3 SL tier set
[7:02:59] jambo_the_nerd: seemed ok back then
[7:03:01] Celestial990: ive been bdk main forever and ditched it for vdh this season
[7:03:10] notSean1992: @jambo_the_nerd you're  afar better player than me then lmao
[7:03:12] Sohen: @twuistx vdh cheat death is insanely bad
[7:03:20] DexterBlackX: @twuistx if you dont play soulcrush you are abit squishy on some st targets but i think EB is def feed the demon dungeon
[7:03:21] Sohen: laughably bad
[7:03:26] jambo_the_nerd: @notSean1992 nah i just have time and watch streamers lol
[7:03:42] omerm98: swap fire mage to frost and ez game gg
[7:03:43] greathasher: Nerf runs it it can't be that bad
[7:04:00] TadinGG: @Celestial990 True
[7:04:01] WolfSuzume: just pull gnarroot xdd
[7:04:02] Celestial990: @jambo_the_nerd it was strong but also stupid gameplay
[7:04:05] DexterBlackX: @Sohen who said that?
[7:04:07] Cosmonuts: Where's yoda
[7:04:09] Sohen: me
[7:04:36] jambo_the_nerd: @Celestial990 i didnt play it, wasnt it kyrian cov and just press heart strike to keep up dancing rune weapon or something?
[7:04:41] WolfSuzume: @dorki are u guys not pulling the pull at 2nd boss like everybody else?
[7:04:51] WolfSuzume: into 2nd boss*
[7:04:52] Razzeu: monkaS cheat build
[7:04:56] omerm98: howcome youre playing retreat?
[7:05:04] notSean1992: is it magic or physical killing him?
[7:05:11] Sohen: its lasher poison stacks
[7:05:11] WolfSuzume: @omerm98 it gets rid of slows
[7:05:12] tmevil_: @omerm98 remove flower debuff
[7:05:15] notSean1992: @omerm98 retreat clears stacks from flower
[7:05:21] omerm98: bruhhhhhhhhhhhh
[7:05:33] omerm98: all the eb runs ive run and not known that
[7:05:34] Aggroboy: cheat SeemsGood
[7:05:34] omerm98: i cba
[7:05:38] Celestial990: @jambo_the_nerd pretty much, you just ignored all rules of not capping resources and the basics of the spec
[7:05:40] Sohen: no stacking frality SADGE
[7:05:41] omerm98: ty all lmfao
[7:06:18] ToxicTomek: Now cause I watched you stream I can be 3500 rio VDH in 1 week easy job
[7:06:31] notSean1992: @omerm98 just take monk or paly healer instead for tigers lust/freedom
[7:07:02] Celestial990: some mathemagician needs to figure out if 100% spikes uptime or soulcrush is better against pulls like everbloom with bunch of mobs meleeing you constantly
[7:07:05] Erueruu: monka spikes
[7:07:12] donkeyu: how is your spike so long?
[7:07:25] DexterBlackX: he is playing extended spike

[7:08:58] notSean1992: @Celestial990 its an interesting one, because in aoe you're not gonna have as high stacks of soulcrush since spirit stacks slower than SC
[7:10:55] Team_Spanky: asianbunnyx is doing some things on that stream son
[7:10:57] augustmourns: I think on avg you get 3-4 stacks of frailty in AOE, so that's 2-3 over baseiline, which is 8-12% DR. spikes is worth that on armor alone, ignoring calcified uptime + parry
[7:11:32] ShyneKnight: @Team_Spanky bro?
[7:11:57] Srkillzalot: someone just tell me what build to run lol

[7:20:29] ghantous: does soulmonger help ST?
[7:20:40] augustmourns: yeah with soulcrush you basically have a defensive cd every time you can pool fury, with LR you have to do some calcified shenanigans with a cooldown like Fel Dev
[7:20:41] metastep: does mage stream?

[7:34:40] elandura: that evoker is paper for every slam :D
[7:35:00] healful1: I don’t understand why you would take a fire mage over a hunter when hunter does more dmg at the moment both are glass canons
[7:35:19] Srkillzalot: Mages are much more tankier than hunters by a long shot
[7:35:23] quicksscope8: @healful1 mage is in no way glass canon
[7:35:24] xGuiha: @healful1 mage is literally immortal
[7:35:27] Srkillzalot: they also have remove curse
[7:35:27] zachl_: hunter is all pad and mages are not glass cannons
[7:35:28] deanw0w69: lmao, if you think hunter is even close to mage
[7:35:29] YarrahPio: mages are not glass cannons
[7:35:29] deanw0w69: HAHAHA
[7:35:31] zachl_: mage cannot die
[7:35:32] elandura: also, mages help party more.
[7:35:58] deanw0w69: Mage has 100x the utility, same dmg, prio dmg out of their ass and int buff
[7:35:58] gellyy: @healful1 true and hunters have pets so they literally have more damage dealers in the party
[7:36:05] Kaitnyl: @syrikk Goodguygreg or something
[7:36:08] Rappppyyy: @healful1 mage is unkillable lmao
[7:36:12] IAttackYou: mage's aoe damage is 100% prio damage
[7:36:23] IAttackYou: and it does comparable to paddiest of classes
[7:36:26] cocopowdong: true hunter pet can also help to tank
[7:36:40] IAttackYou: damage and no survivability

[7:36:48] planooooooooooooooooooooo: uhhh frost trap, maybe???? Joel
[7:36:49] MBG_95: The issue is pugs mages are god awful at defensive usage, even up to 25+
[7:36:49] kouzis: WHAT Y
[7:36:50] vellocets: poor hunters? what about ELEMENTAL SHAMAN
[7:36:53] vellocets: WHAT ABOUT US MAN
[7:37:04] IAttackYou: can live with worst defensives
[7:37:05] weezyjw: 5+ minute fortified boss kekw
[7:37:05] notSean1992: I've made a survival hunter alt, the its fun but god does it feel useless for any mechanics/stops/etc

[7:37:14] donkeyu: agreed!
[7:37:16] Ventorpoe: @zachl_ why every time i see you type you saying dumb shit
[7:37:17] healful1: look you give hunter there actual defensive pet and you increase there health pool and gives them a defensive to make them less of a glass canon only thing your really bringing mage for is in my
[7:37:18] healful1: but
[7:37:20] healful1: int
[7:37:22] MBG_95: Not really, alter is literally the only weird one
[7:37:26] IAttackYou: vendor

[7:38:05] deanw0w69: wtf is hard about alter exactly? you press it when 100% before mechanic comes and press it again when low, very hard cd
[7:38:06] zachl_: @Ventorpoe mages are immortal and hunters are all pad MAJORW
[7:38:07] tisiwonz: Dont forget mage has better prio dmg has mass barrier which is usful for a lot
[7:38:10] Tofterid: what else you need but 2 good boys
[7:38:15] donkeyu: lots of deffensives and along with manage proc/skb and time warps

[7:39:59] quicksscope8: @healful1 db, blast wave
[7:40:35] Adzie: bringing mass barrier for the group is pretty much the biggest pro for mage to be honest
[7:41:10] healful1: binding shot was huge and can be if used right
[7:41:11] thedoofbert: @Adzie i would say the huge prio dmg is the main reason
[7:41:19] healful1: so db ain’t that big imo

[7:43:31] jpctheman_: 4 stinger 20 lasher
[7:43:33] Adzie: @thedoofbert yeah idd, I just think the big thing that sets them apart from other good dps is bringing a really nice group wide defensive. can’t get the hunter to mass turtle me on soul rend can we :D

[11:47:08] Todfishh: Hello @dorki or anyone else who can answer Ive got a question abt m+ and raid. What would you say is more scripted out of m+ and raid and what has more variables out of the two assuming everyone is playing almost perfect asking to settle a debate with high copium individual
[11:47:16] stagpul: lookUp
[11:47:28] floodoec: @Todfishh m+ more variation imo
[11:47:32] Melbort: lookUp Happy for you or sorry that happened
[11:47:40] deanw0w69: both are scripted….
[11:47:41] flockheart: lookUp Happy for you or sorry that happened
[11:47:45] deanw0w69: this is pve
[11:47:46] OGLexagon: raid is def more scripted and consistent
[11:47:47] MattCGs: raid is literally a scripted dance
[11:47:56] plinplinpl0n: also, raid fights are literally scripted
[11:48:02] MattCGs: m+ varies from comp to comp unless you have a team thats consistent w every kick assigned
[11:48:25] jovpsy: well he asks if every1 is playing perfect
[11:48:30] pipiy: is this meta comp?
[11:48:34] flockheart: dorkiClap huge bleed dispel
[11:48:40] jovpsy: id still say raid is mega more scripted than m+
[11:48:48] litixio: m+ is random as fuck some times, raid is never anything different
[11:49:10] MattCGs: WCM has mobs that randomly move so theres that

[11:50:03] dadgamer_o7: does scripted necessarily mean easier though? isn't the goal of most games played at a high level to make games as scripted and predictable as possible
