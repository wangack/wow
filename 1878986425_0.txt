[0:30:52] nobbynobes: monks are a lot tankier, should give them a try
[0:31:00] Vanguarded: Your survivability comes from your procs and isntant heals
[0:31:15] Vanguarded: You cna choose to use your maelstrom for instnat chain or lightning bolt or insteat healing surge
[0:31:40] Vanguarded: Earthbind for the second go on you
[0:32:12] Vanguarded: You should get 4 casts
[0:32:16] Vanguarded: TYhere should also be a pvp talent
[0:32:20] Vanguarded: For healing surge echoing
[0:32:25] Vanguarded: unless it got removed

[0:33:08] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:33:34] Vanguarded: Earthbind is normally for the second go on you. You dont earthbind the first time someone jumps on you because they will normally use some minor cd like warrior leap or priest fade to leave the area. Its a decently long cd. So you use it on the second go where they are more liekly to stand in it for longer since they have fewer escap[es second time round if that makes sense

[5:51:29] ATGCTA: bid on it just to dom them
[5:51:39] drizz1er: its agi
[5:51:41] drizz1er: lol

[5:55:47] taasty__: yes it is bis for fury
[5:56:26] EliBourne: good mage boots
[5:56:28] diarog: They can be used for T9
[5:56:32] AedrictTV: there's an agi hit arp ring from 10 man that's pretty good
[5:56:32] StoneyNugs: they normally go for about 4k each
[5:56:35] StoneyNugs: sometimes 5k
[5:56:51] diarog: But you need marks to buy the t9 gear with the trophies
[5:56:57] plebfarmer: Really good chest for PvE
[5:56:57] EliBourne: lol
[5:57:06] EliBourne: didnt see mail DOH
[5:57:14] diarog: Emblem of triumph
[5:57:17] Freakyzoid84: yea definately :)
[5:57:22] taasty__: T9 chestpiece is better it have armorpen this one isnt that good for you
[5:57:43] diarog: If you want 245 itemlevel tier 9 you need emblems + trophy
[5:57:52] plebfarmer: But still decnt till he gets the main one:)
[5:57:54] StoneyNugs: with the currency also
[5:57:56] AedrictTV: yea
[5:58:03] AedrictTV: you get any piece with trophies
[5:58:10] dave2390: trophy plus emblems gets you whatever piece given you have enough emblems
[5:58:13] StoneyNugs: you also need emblems of triumph and the trphoey
[5:58:13] Emmanuelxt12: swiftyNom swiftyNom swiftyNom
[5:58:14] morrebus: Yeah, you can pick what piece you want to buy with the trophy. 75 for Head, Chest, Legs and 45 for Shoulders & Gloves.
[5:58:17] AedrictTV: pieces cost one trophy and either 45 or 75 emblems depending on slot
[5:58:17] raddycan: trophy + emblems = set piece
[5:58:26] taasty__: trophy get any piece in 245item lvl, for chest/leg/head you need 75emblem + throphi and 45emble+trophie for shoulders and hand
[5:58:39] Freakyzoid84: now you can pickup the gold in the mail :P
[5:58:46] StoneyNugs: you have 28
[5:58:46] AedrictTV: nope
[5:58:48] diarog: You only have 28 though
[5:58:49] niko2timezz: need badges too
[5:58:51] StoneyNugs: emblems of triumph
[5:59:00] morrebus: No, trophys drop from bosses. Emblems you get 25 each 25man raid and 20 pieces from 10 man heroic clear.
[5:59:02] raddycan: trophy of the crusade boss drop
[5:59:03] StoneyNugs: i dont think you can get a piece
[5:59:03] AedrictTV: you have emblem of triumph, trophies are an item you get from the raid
[5:59:13] StoneyNugs: only two sockets
[5:59:27] EliBourne: look under currency
[5:59:36] diarog: daily heroic!
[5:59:38] StoneyNugs: is the pot looking juicy?
[5:59:40] diarog: gives you lots of trophies
[5:59:45] AedrictTV: you can also do the daily heroic for emblems, you can get 5 per day
[5:59:51] morrebus: Question. Are you only going to PvP or are you actually heading into PvE aswell?
[5:59:59] StoneyNugs: did you see that ring that went for 3m on EU on a GDKP?
[6:00:39] EliBourne: pally gear ?
[6:01:27] StoneyNugs: what ring did you pass on?
[6:01:28] khaled78448: ***
[6:01:49] raddycan: EU gdkps are crazy
[6:01:58] AedrictTV: if you get 2 piece dps tier battle stance will give 6% more arp, so that would likely help a lot
[6:02:03] AedrictTV: for pvp
[6:02:27] StoneyNugs: tier
[6:02:28] AedrictTV: thats the tier token
[6:02:31] dave2390: thats the trophy for Tier
[6:02:31] StoneyNugs: bid it to 4k
[6:02:33] raddycan: trophy + emblems = set piece
[6:02:36] Freakyzoid84: tier pieces with a token
[6:02:43] StoneyNugs: they normally go for 4-5k
[6:02:44] bigricchh: Tier you noob
[6:02:47] StoneyNugs: they have a ton
[6:02:52] taasty__: Throphy+Triumph emble = T9 in 245item lvl
[6:02:53] morrebus: Trophy = Tier (Alongside with Emblems, 45 for Shoulders & Gloves, 75 Emblems for Head, Chest, Legs).

[6:05:47] Nobeas: :)
[6:05:52] EliBourne: 2*5.5=11
[6:05:54] StoneyNugs: you aint using them anytime soon
[6:05:58] yacer_123: you dont need 4 bro
[6:05:59] AedrictTV: now you'll need a bunch of triumph emblems to get your tier though
[6:06:04] kragnos0: so much gold O.O
[6:06:04] raddycan: you need emblems too
[6:06:06] SSD511_: what happened to your gold I just take my dog for a walk LUL
[6:06:08] 11keithi: uh.. emiruWOW emiruWOW
[6:06:15] AedrictTV: 4 set
[6:06:20] dave2390: now you just need emblems of triumph
[6:06:21] yacer_123: yes
[6:06:25] StoneyNugs: no join a 10man next
[6:06:30] morrebus: Pay in mind you need 240 emblems, considering you buy all 4 pieces (2 of the cheapst ones included)
[6:06:39] StoneyNugs: you aint getting 2 set today
[6:06:39] bigricchh: You get emblems during raid
[6:06:40] khintara: you need like 240 emblems for 4 set
[6:06:41] taasty__: T9chest have arpen
[6:06:45] raddycan: trophy + emblems = tier set piece
[6:06:48] Freakyzoid84: yea.. Do 10 man :)
[6:06:49] bigricchh: Use those and the trophy.
[6:06:54] yacer_123: you need to save for the trincket
[6:07:12] khaled78448: you have to do VOA 25
[6:07:15] engineerunitz: Darkgormaster subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months!

[6:07:16] StreamElements: Darkgormaster just subscribed for 16 months in a row PogChamp
[6:07:17] StoneyNugs: no
[6:07:20] StoneyNugs: you over payed
[6:07:22] StoneyNugs: you good
[6:07:23] EliBourne: thats 60 emblems each
[6:07:36] StoneyNugs: dont buy anymore
[6:07:49] khaled78448: 4
[6:07:51] moziakk: you have your own arcade machines? cool
[6:07:53] EliBourne: stop buying @swifty
[6:07:56] Elldwin: @Swifty you didn't overpay, they're paying 5k ea too
[6:07:59] Ryzah: You have enough and as if it matters what he paid when he has 150k gold lmao
[6:08:08] bigricchh: Swifty. You need emblems and the trophy to buy tier. Quit listening to the plebs. You get emblems from raids.
[6:08:19] StoneyNugs: the pot is looking juicy
[6:08:26] EliBourne: swifty didnt overpay he just bought a few too many
[6:08:39] StoneyNugs: @bigricchh not enought to buy a piece of tier tho LUL
[6:08:57] morrebus: Brother, let me explain! Trophys, together with Emblems combine into set pieces. x1 Trophy + 45 Emblems = Gloves or Shoulders. x1 Trophy + 75 Emblems = Head or Legs or Chest. You are looking into 5,33 weeks of full 25 clears + full 10 man clears to get your 4 set.
[6:09:04] khintara: 28 out of 240
[6:09:07] brightvenom_nossen: d
[6:09:12] bigricchh: You need ~60 emblems with trophy per piece.
[6:09:21] Freakyzoid84: 4 set is 5% increased critical strike chance on Slam and HS abilities
[6:09:25] EliBourne: 28/60
[6:09:35] brightvenom_nossen: !followage
[6:09:46] morrebus: Now you don't have to buy them anymore although!
[6:10:25] bigricchh: Just do random raids, then you have tier for ICC.
[6:10:25] Freakyzoid84: 10 Man! 10 Man!
[6:10:43] StoneyNugs: i would bid about 700g
[6:10:45] StoneyNugs: bid 700g
[6:10:53] EliBourne: crusader orb is about 300g
[6:11:04] StoneyNugs: bid 800
[6:11:10] StoneyNugs: 250 each on bene
[6:11:12] StoneyNugs: maybe cheaper
[6:11:19] StoneyNugs: so many gdkps heres
[6:11:27] EliBourne: ive paid for 4 months subs selling gems
[6:11:32] Freakyzoid84: Emblems
[6:11:39] Freakyzoid84: Deaths Verdict?
[6:11:42] bigricchh: You do 10 man for emblems bro.
[6:11:47] AedrictTV: once you finish up in here you should go check out the tier vendors outside of the raid entrance to see what you think is worth taking once you have enough emblems for them. Protection helmet and legs give block value and hit, dps shoulders and chest give armorpen and crit @Swifty
[6:11:52] morrebus: No , trinket is horrendous from 10 man. Don't bother, but you still have a ring with Armor pen, you also have a waist with armor pen.
[6:12:08] letsplayletsgo: Did I just stumble into the stock market?
[6:12:29] AedrictTV: yea
[6:12:33] StoneyNugs: you got 4.4k coming back
[6:12:45] Freakyzoid84: well the 10 man trinket is probs better than what ya got :D
[6:12:55] AedrictTV: thats a good alternative but you'll probably want 2 piece dps for pvp no? or do you mainly just do defensive stance
[6:13:02] bigricchh: BTW guys this is the one streamer that's been around forever who still reads chat. He is the reason I got a Naga more than a decade ago. Love this guy do glad he is still going.

[7:12:15] snowman56: Arcades are also destinations too. People don't just drive by one and say lets stop in. People google arcades near me, and maps it from there.
[7:12:23] AedrictTV: armorpen is really good for pvp, almost necessary for warrior. some classes have so much physical damage reduction the value of attack power just diminishes a lot
[7:12:24] Ekzekutisto: ask yourself why itÂ´s 1/3 of the price
[7:12:30] snowman56: So location becomes slightly less relevant.
[7:12:30] chet__0: No one is making money on arcades bro

[7:35:14] AedrictTV: Im sick of arms getting overshadowed by fury in classic honestly. I was really looking forward to arms in wrath while we were in burning crusade but so far it's just been outperformed by fury by a lot and they refuse to buff arms because its better in pvp than fury

[7:35:36] Sabotajze: Hi Swify

[7:36:07] wagyu_88: think he is talking pve
[7:36:08] Absolute_96: yup shadowlands
[7:36:08] AedrictTV: fury has a mortal strike atm
[7:36:14] AedrictTV: its a proc on auto attacks though
[7:36:33] AedrictTV: we use either rogue wound poison or hunter aimed shots in raid
[7:36:55] AedrictTV: its not reliable for sure
[7:36:59] AedrictTV: never said it was good lol
[7:37:32] AedrictTV: pvp arms is absolutely really good
[7:37:54] AedrictTV: I just wish it could keep up with fury in pve to a degree where it would be minor enough to not care
[7:38:18] wagyu_88: I just really hate how WoW has no turned into ROBOT pvp scripted help.
[7:38:18] SpidercowSD: @SwiftyOn Live? Oh yes People are Scipting 100% heard Shamens are on a instant kick on certain casts
[7:38:55] AedrictTV: wrath classic fury has a rng proc mortal strike that is 25% stacking twice
[7:38:56] Ayyur: wasup swifty how are you doing
[7:38:57] AedrictTV: up to 50%
[7:39:18] AedrictTV: its not very reliable at all, its like 90% uptime if you're constantly on your target
[7:39:21] Sabotajze: Does Blizzard detect/ ban scripters ?
[7:39:47] AedrictTV: ms being 100% uptime as long as you're on your target is just better definitely

[7:41:45] AedrictTV: its the stacking debuff from rampage
[7:42:06] wagyu_88: What is blizzards obsession with making roigues OP all the time in every game
