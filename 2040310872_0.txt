[0:04:15] jng476: Is there an encounter you go into just thinking "Ahhh shit"
[0:04:22] hobit0213: you have really great takes on many things :)
[0:04:23] s_dawg1: I had like 7 or 8 attempts at a throne of tides this week and every time people just failed at the boss mechanics
[0:05:22] hobit0213: 3rd boss on TOTT is really bad this week
[0:05:37] hobit0213: with afflicted and the dispel overlaps
[0:06:19] scilencedh: bursting has to go at least and they need to change how afflicted works. feels really bad to be the only one in the group that can handle aff

[0:38:05] Vitaraptor: What are bis trinkets for disc in m+ in yur opinion?
[0:40:09] ren0m: If you play one spec and decide to try out another, do you have to get new gear? Or is it fine in lower keys.
[0:40:33] nixar1: do you think twilight equilibrium is really worth to take? how much it really boosts your damage/healing
[0:40:34] Vitaraptor: Thanks
[0:41:35] ren0m: Secondary stats are the "problem"
[0:41:36] ren0m: Ye that
[0:42:25] ren0m: I guess iLvl is the most important "stat". Or so I've heard.
[0:42:29] lazylad02: Hello jb TwitchConHYPE
[0:42:55] ren0m: But I'm not sure why that's the case
[0:43:15] sw0ngs: @ren0m primary stat
[0:43:52] Ninjian: @ren0m comes with more stam and primary stat
[0:44:03] ren0m: So if I have X item that is +8 iLvl, but it loses 400 of my secondary stat, is it worth swapping?
[0:44:30] sirk122: Unstable Arcanocrystal lol
[0:45:19] sw0ngs: @ren0m you wont be losing secondary stats, since you will just get it in something that isn't prio
[0:45:51] AlsoZen: are you saying that, for example, a Primary Stat trinket with Seconaries was fixed? Or A secondary stat trinket with a primary proc
[0:46:02] ren0m: Ah ok, so iLvl is the most important "stat" because of primary stats. Secondaries are not that important.

[1:32:17] Galois_rg: what about nature's vigil
[1:32:21] kelly_mac06: @asphyxiiaTV i hate fort but like what i dont like about afflicted is that so few classes can help with it
[1:33:01] Antibrew: I hate that even classes that can help with it dont help with it...

[1:33:25] devilhawk83: chrysLUL
[1:33:27] Antibrew: but how you gonna zug if you spend a global helping your healer keep up
[1:33:29] asphyxiiaTV: @kelly_mac06 well true, very very few but i mean fucc fort right
[1:33:38] kelly_mac06: @kelly_mac06 fuck fort FOR EVER
[1:33:43] ren0m: That reminds me. What's the situation with no healer keys this season? Is it still a thing?
[1:33:43] kelly_mac06: OMG HOW WAS THE GAME
[1:33:44] Whitewolf1441: YO HOW ABOUT THOSE CHIEFS
[1:33:46] CMTerp: f the chiefs
[1:33:49] ren0m: We're all from EU, we don't know about that
[1:33:51] kelly_mac06: FUCK THE CHIEFS im so sad
[1:33:52] asphyxiiaTV: YO HOW BOUT THOSE CHIEFS
[1:33:55] kelly_mac06: i wanted the bills to win

[1:34:15] YdenTV: Lions
[1:34:15] shaevizla: what sport is it
[1:34:19] kelly_mac06: i was so happy for the Lions
[1:34:21] Blackgoose25: bucs and lions
[1:34:28] ren0m: @shaevizla eggball
[1:34:33] kelly_mac06: it's been forever since they have done well, i would love to see them in the superbowl
[1:34:41] shaevizla: LUL
[1:35:18] ren0m: I understand nothing.
[1:35:56] kelly_mac06: LOL you sound like me when im watching the saints. When they start losing i turn it off
[1:36:06] ren0m: Can you explain that in "soccer" terms?
[1:36:28] devilhawk83: I am hoping Deebo Samuels is going to be available for the 49ers as Detroit is going to be a tough matchup for San Francisco
[1:37:07] Antibrew: dont worry Lions will find a way to turn into the same old lions next week
[1:37:14] JukeboxHey: ad
[1:38:17] Whitewolf1441: lol
[1:38:25] kelly_mac06: @Antibrew SHUSH! lmao
[1:38:44] devilhawk83: Lions are a solid team that are well coached and Jared Goff is playing very well so I got a feeling it is going to be a close game
[1:38:50] tabxzer: eating cock :O
[1:40:03] YdenTV: This is the healer eating a swirly in rise on 28 when you're about to time it.
[1:40:15] Antibrew: I want the lions to win
[1:40:31] Antibrew: but unfortunately when you have been a fan for 30 years it is hard to get hopes up
[1:41:22] Ninjian: @Antibrew just be happy they've done this well, no need to be all dark and gloomy over the next game. enjoy the deep playoff run and have fun with it!
[1:42:13] kelly_mac06: @Ninjian i love how well the lions have done. i expect nothing bc im a saints fan - i have VERY low expectations because of that lol
[1:42:45] kelly_mac06: yea the Saints miss Dan Campbell A LOT
[1:42:49] Antibrew: the problem I see for the lions going forward though is their 2ndary is dog water
[1:42:49] kelly_mac06: but im super happy for the Lions
[1:42:55] kelly_mac06: next week is gonna be tough as hell
[1:42:59] Antibrew: their offense is playing very well
[1:43:02] Antibrew: which im happy about
[1:43:08] kelly_mac06: yea it is not great
[1:43:12] kelly_mac06: but they have gotten this far
[1:43:23] kelly_mac06: the niners are gonna be HARD to beat
[1:43:26] Antibrew: ya
[1:43:31] kelly_mac06: very hard
[1:43:39] kelly_mac06: but im hoping for a good showing
[1:43:45] Antibrew: they need to get after Purdy and I think they will do well
[1:43:53] Antibrew: need another 2 sack game outa Hutch
[1:44:03] kelly_mac06: oh for sure
[1:44:05] vanillasky7788: are u playing on EU still
[1:44:29] Antibrew: people already labeling him dirty though..
[1:44:30] kelly_mac06: yea it's a great story
[1:44:45] kelly_mac06: meh ppl that don't like good football @Antibrew
[1:44:50] devilhawk83: probably but currently Deebo is being listed as 50-50 for the Lions-49ers game so if Deebo is out, that is one less threat the Lions got to face @kelly_mac06
[1:45:00] Antibrew: they dont like seeing hip drop tackles on their QB
[1:45:15] Antibrew: or their QB even being touched for that matter
[1:45:25] kelly_mac06: @devilhawk83 oh i didn't know he was questionable! that's great for the lions
[1:45:41] kelly_mac06: @Antibrew it's so fucking stupid. i blame tom brady lol
[1:46:11] devilhawk83: It is a shoulder injury so it will be closely monitored
[1:46:39] kelly_mac06: @devilhawk83 ugh, that's a shame. hopefully he doesn't push himself to play and really fuck it up
[1:46:50] anaya909: that's our motto in cleveland WutFace
[1:47:00] SparrowONE: Bledsoe got injured back in the day - that gave Brady the chance. Just saying :D
[1:47:35] kelly_mac06: LOL pls no
[1:47:49] Pinslate: didnt it also bring dak
[1:47:52] SparrowONE: My point is that you at times need bad things to happen for something great to take place.
[1:47:54] SparrowONE: hehe
[1:47:56] Antibrew: isnt that what happened to Alex Smith with Mahomes?
[1:48:05] kelly_mac06: i talk a lot of shit but i remember how bad it was for Carr when he was on the texans back in the day. That poor fucker got sacked so many times there is no way he's normal now
[1:48:13] Antibrew: got ya
[1:48:23] Antibrew: I thought Smith got hurt
[1:48:51] WQKPtheDON: didn’t Alex smith get hurt in San fran and that let kaepernick in
[1:49:37] kelly_mac06: yea it's awful. those poor guys were wrecked
[1:50:14] kelly_mac06: i remember watching Curtis Martin run, then finding out the poor bastard had no cartilage left in his knees
[1:50:14] Antibrew: wait he was in Washington when his leg got broke
[1:50:19] kelly_mac06: they just tear their bodies apart
[1:50:20] Antibrew: 2018 just found it
[1:50:35] kelly_mac06: @Antibrew yes when he got the catastrophic leg injury he was a Reskin
[1:50:42] Antibrew: almost had to have it amputated
[1:51:24] kelly_mac06: yea the post surgical infections almost killed that whole leg
[1:51:27] kelly_mac06: was really sad to see

[1:54:45] maneatingpotato1: Variety stream it up man!
[1:54:46] JhindredX: Sup JB, saw your tweet about no affixes. I agree! mind elaborating on what you would like from M+ going forward?

[1:54:53] WytherOK: it's great

[1:55:59] JhindredX: agreed @nebulizer87
[1:56:20] Nebulizer87: i would prefer D2 style with one positive affix with one of these shitty ones

[1:56:53] somethineuw: GULP

[1:57:44] somethineuw: blizzard probably thinks healers aren't suffering enough
[1:57:59] Purgatus_: Well JB you see, some weeks you need to dispel mobs in the dungeon that will reduce your haste to 50% otherwise
[1:58:02] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[1:58:07] somethineuw: builds character KEKW
[1:58:08] JhindredX: I actually hate Tyrannical. I don’t want to fight a raid boss unless I’m in raid.
[1:58:11] cahillross: Affixes should be completely optional for extra rewards or something like gold or higher loot chance. So you do it if you really need it, otherwise just push for the fun without the hassle
[1:58:48] FuruF: Second boss of Fall is just so much more fun this week.
[1:59:32] JhindredX: true
[1:59:39] drumminbacon: @furuf oh heck yeah. hunting an afflicted that spawned way opposite me behind the max ranged warlock gets me bricked up
[2:00:10] Tiny_Tinee: All affixes or would you keep Fort/Tyra?
[2:00:29] JhindredX: all affixes imo
[2:00:39] Antibrew: I like the idea of Fort/Tyr personally
[2:00:41] SparrowONE: They should make a Season of Affixes in Classic and see how they'd like it.
[2:00:53] Antibrew: but yeah all the other stuff could GTFO personally
[2:01:21] JhindredX: lol @sparrowone
[2:01:24] drumminbacon: i did so many dungeons in cataclysm farming whatever the marks were called back then
[2:01:41] Caz1_: ya they only look forward to the last affixes being gone lmao
[2:01:44] somethineuw: my chance of kms is higher on afflicted weeks as a healer :)
[2:01:53] cahillross: Give Buff affixes, say no to curse affixes. Encrypted was the best affix ever
[2:02:10] Purgatus_: the opening line of the site everyone uses to see the current affixes is 'what garbage affixes do i have to deal with this week?'
[2:02:11] ottomr1990: if they need things to spice up dungeons then I’d like to see them do something similar to the random torghast affixes where you got like 2 positive and 2 negative
[2:02:16] Pandho: for me +14-17 keys feel dead, because there is no real better reward, but you have to deal with 1 extra dumb affix
[2:02:21] Miltrath: Make affixes selectable when starting keys for bonus loot but none required
[2:02:23] Scuzzle__: truuuuue
[2:02:26] kelly_mac06: it was fun and different in legion
[2:02:32] Brisklet: but where do they get the idea that palyers like that? It's been years since people say it's garbage
[2:02:37] kelly_mac06: but it's been 4 expacs now
[2:02:43] kelly_mac06: they haven't really iterated on them
[2:02:55] JhindredX: it was only supposed to be in Legion @kelly_mac06
[2:02:55] kelly_mac06: and most if not all are just not "fun" to deal with
[2:03:02] kelly_mac06: @MattKnoes ya
[2:03:10] WytherOK: Necrotic! LuL
[2:03:17] JhindredX: it was well received, but now it’s like… meh
[2:03:20] cahillross: Skittish r.i.p
[2:03:21] Nebulizer87: legion was only fun cuz we didn't have target cap
[2:03:24] JukeboxHey: Bolstering bosses
[2:03:25] JukeboxHey: KEKW
[2:03:28] kelly_mac06: oh no no what i meant was the idea was fun and different in legion - not the actual affixes @jdotb
[2:03:32] JukeboxHey: And ragin
[2:03:33] JukeboxHey: holy
[2:03:39] JhindredX: true @nebulizer87
[2:03:43] drumminbacon: it’s funny that they are so married to affixes when even they have clearly noticed that the only “good” affixes are essentially not doing anything
[2:03:53] JhindredX: and no GCD
[2:04:16] JhindredX: it was just more content
[2:04:21] JhindredX: which is what they need
[2:04:30] cahillross: Yeah teeming also increased mob count required iirc
[2:04:39] maenkins: KR teaming KEKW
[2:04:41] kelly_mac06: Teeming In Seat of the Triumvirate was fucking AWFUL
[2:04:41] YdenTV: Remember the Lantern guys in maw?
[2:04:52] Hemenia: I can't actually believe we played that shit and loved it. Remember OVERFLOWING?
[2:04:55] tastefulsidebob: when you had to go in the pillars and kill the mini bosses so they weren’t at the last boss I hated that shit
[2:04:56] kelly_mac06: @cahillross yup
[2:05:01] Nebulizer87: they honestly have such a bad track record of making affixes
[2:05:08] kelly_mac06: @Nebulizer87 yup 󠀀
[2:05:16] JhindredX: make dungeons be dungeons again, mage tower every season, m+ have better achievement rewards, maybe a new iteration of Torghast but fun.
[2:05:26] drall743: they should just  weekly buff specs that arent getting invited to keys up to +20. wuld be fun
[2:05:28] JhindredX: none of it required, just content for fun
[2:05:45] calidorei: What's the most OP trinket ever in this game? All expansions. I'm thinking Draught of Souls.
[2:06:04] kelly_mac06: @calidorei Arcanocrystal
[2:06:10] JhindredX: arcanocrystal
[2:06:20] noewon: YEP expand over. delete affix plx
[2:06:21] JhindredX: from Withered Jim
[2:06:25] kelly_mac06: the one from Withered Jim- ppl kept that fucking thing forEVER
[2:06:35] drumminbacon: Deathbringer’s Will or Arcanocrystal
[2:06:38] lucashowmuchpain: honestly removeing affixes as a trial for season 4 might be good
[2:07:08] kelly_mac06: @lucashowmuchpain right?
[2:07:11] Morphzero: Mythic + with followers!!!
[2:07:25] JhindredX: oh god followers? no way lol
[2:07:26] kelly_mac06: @jdotb so if they remove affixes they just keep scaling right or no
[2:07:28] Nokram: i also would like a fleshed out reward system. high score is not enough motivation for me to push high keys
[2:08:00] Scuzzle__: i like the change, that u can get max gear out of m+ right now
[2:08:05] Ninjian: @Nokram more transmog or mount custom stuff like Delves is getting would be good
[2:08:32] kelly_mac06: man that would be fun ad
[2:08:34] Sokchoy: when dragon slaying
[2:08:36] kelly_mac06: *af
[2:08:37] drumminbacon: @nokram i think at that point then high keys just aren’t for you? It would be miserable to make rewards go higher for the general player
[2:08:40] kelly_mac06: i think that would be great
[2:08:44] kelly_mac06: see how high you can push
[2:08:51] kelly_mac06: before the scaling just kills you
[2:09:02] branphd: OMEGALUL
[2:09:03] Hemenia: WHAT IS THIS
[2:09:06] drumminbacon: @nokram unless you mean cosmetic. then i agree
[2:09:09] Nokram: @drumminbacon i mean, there are gladiator mounts aswell
[2:09:19] somethineuw: afflicted in the bedroom
[2:09:37] Sokchoy: "in theory"
[2:09:48] kelly_mac06: @Nokram yea i think- for me- it's rough that the rewards cap out at like 2500. There should be more
[2:09:50] Morphzero: I come for the pew pew, stay for the toxicity!
[2:10:14] JukeboxHey: First bosses PogChamp
[2:10:28] drumminbacon: dude some of the coolest things i’ve ever seen in dungeons is when the MDI teams would pull the whole second boss room in Underrot
[2:10:55] JhindredX: do you think the trash currently do too much in M+ or do you like all the abilities and mechanics? @jdotb
[2:11:02] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:11:18] teqlamage: If raiding was fun people would dloit after prog
[2:11:59] drumminbacon: *cough* throne of the tides *cough cough*
[2:12:05] JhindredX: lol
[2:12:05] WytherOK: I wish they would stop trying to make every pack lethal
[2:12:22] WytherOK: with awful casts and non-stop interrupts
[2:12:22] JhindredX: yeah Veng makes things obsolete lol
[2:13:08] Nebulizer87: well mythic raiding lockouts are so dated, they should allow you to raid mythic with friends and just personal loot lockout aka FFXIV
[2:13:18] JhindredX: what’s your go-to song for a key right now if you could choose?
[2:13:45] drumminbacon: I like the mythic plus is essentially speed running. speed running is typically breaking the game in the most efficient way. But every time we figure out how to break the game blizzard, blizzard patches it
[2:14:23] kelly_mac06: there is a raid lead discord that has a bunch of good info on m Fyrakk
[2:14:37] kelly_mac06: since there seem to be a dearth of written guildes
[2:14:47] kelly_mac06: a lot ppl are getting the info there
[2:15:53] Nebulizer87: started prog on fryakk and already miss tindral
[2:16:14] kelly_mac06: @Nebulizer87 LOL fyrakk is no joke
[2:16:15] JhindredX: lol damn. best of luck @nebulizer87
[2:16:42] Jaylight__: bold move to reclear tindral
[2:17:13] kelly_mac06: wait yall are gonna reclear tindie?
[2:17:15] kelly_mac06: yikes
[2:18:10] Nebulizer87: i think they are holding out cuz we still have HoF slots, but id rather they just make adjustments to Fry now there are some very annoying design decisions in that fight
[2:19:50] YdenTV: AD 12 MEGA CHADS sounds like a group we should join...
[2:20:41] drumminbacon: I’ve thought this for a while and never said anything. Are you vibing to DanceXL from Apple Music? Or is this a massive coincidence?
[2:27:04] Sokchoy: is this last key before raid
[2:27:25] mikeybro93: gamer
[2:27:30] caradea_: some young man reflexes there
[2:29:42] drumminbacon: I’m (slowly) learning Havoc and i fel rushed off the bridge before the horde/alliance boss here and somehow instinctively saved my own life with glide. I have since tried recreating it on random edges here and there and can’t do it again
[2:38:55] verenofromhr: @drumminbacon ya i have done that before. nearly shit my pants
[2:41:34] emilliah: alter LuL

[2:42:41] johnswordttv: @Sheepamig  a weak aura for sure
[2:42:51] devilhawk83: This boss on Tyrannical is so intense
[2:43:06] Tfos: timer was superb tho !
[2:43:47] Morphzero: one day you'll be able to type "try again" because keys won't downgrade.  Blizz will fix it soon
[2:43:58] FauniB: sheesh what a depleto
[2:44:06] Tfos: so fucked u rarely gonna see last boss which is hardest
[2:44:12] maneatingpotato1: @Sheepamig https://wago.io/cursorcombo

[3:02:18] or3g: @Maplewindz granted ive only healed a 23, but being dwarf/having leaf helps

[5:43:47] Mafre1: If you get spell bop then you just keep walking towards the boss during instants/penance
[5:43:56] Mafre1: Should keep you within boss range
[5:43:59] flawlesslykun: tell your homie evoker to rescue on that EZ
[5:44:13] Mafre1: They just cant cast smite then which makes it bad with shadowfiend I guess

[5:58:40] TSmarine: Disc usually gets spellward there, and they go towards the right
[5:58:46] TSmarine: so they orbs dont go towards raid
[5:58:47] jdotb: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Agmnq6M12w8TjLb9#fight=154&view=replay
[5:59:14] TSmarine: if they go to left, they lead the orbs ahead of raid a little - making a stray orb occassionally
[5:59:19] Swizzy06: yea
[5:59:38] Swizzy06: most are getting spellwarding at dreamrend 2
