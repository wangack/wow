[8:01:30] Schnudelie: i thought lofi means now that there is no much distortion in the song, so you dont get distracted by the song.. Or did i misunderstand you guys huh
[8:01:53] nikeanklecuts: nah
[8:01:54] Bobbymoons: Fidelity is the quality of faithfulness or loyalty. Its original meaning regarded duty in a broader sense than the related concept of fealty. Both derive from the Latin word fidēlis, meaning "faithful or loyal"
[8:02:24] Schnudelie: Too much braining for my brain
[8:02:35] Bobbymoons: so to go against the grain is that right?
