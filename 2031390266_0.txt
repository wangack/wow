[0:48:35] Zenlyn: U get guarenteed rewards for doing world quests, there's a chance u lose mmr if u queue shuffle if u go 3-3. Meaning world content is more rewarding than pvp

[1:47:57] SaintHearth: Go frost if you want people to be upset they can never touch you
[1:48:04] hulkdieselx: is wish there was a warrior build that wasnt bleed focused. not a huge fan of the bleeds
[1:48:11] byagiza: wow! thanks for the explanation! @venruki
[1:48:28] Ronn_Deezy: for newer players i struggled on frost the most cause if you get kicked you cant block, once i got better at fake casting it became so much easier
[1:48:29] OMGWhatsHisFace: are you looking at magnusz' talents? he's been using arms in m+ recentyl
[1:48:39] OMGWhatsHisFace: aah ok
[1:49:34] Salastro: wait. No ignore pain anymore? what?
[1:49:41] gelatokush: arcane is hardest of the 3 spec for me idk i just cant graps arcane but i do okay on fire and frost
[1:49:45] dryangore: why do you think arcane is easiest for defense? just chronoshift? every lower cd def is on arcane school so if you get kicked all you really have is your one block
[1:50:01] Salastro: the specces you just checked did not play with it
[1:50:06] happyheals: you have a choice for that or healing from bleeds methinks
[1:50:23] SaintHearth: @dryangore you answered your own question my guy
[1:50:28] Ronn_Deezy: Blizzard is really really droping the bag by not letting you play sod while in shuff q on same account
[1:50:36] Zeniticon: its the boots
[1:50:43] Zeniticon: fast footwork
[1:50:50] OMGWhatsHisFace: the healing from bleeds node in the right side tree is pretty huge. you can drop warbreaker.

[1:51:26] ferahgok: does it interact with the execute buffing MS talent? is that why?
[1:51:27] OMGWhatsHisFace: also, on the right tree, the last node on the left is droppable. the red/white skull. Fatality
[1:52:03] OMGWhatsHisFace: from talent trees ive seen

[1:54:47] Lleo00: i like bitter too
[1:54:50] Lleo00: nice heal and cleanse
[1:54:55] zachgamegodx: they either play the 200% dmg threshold on fear with 5% auto attack speed or they play wrecking throw
[1:54:58] gelatokush: i feel like bitter immuntity is just one more butt defensively and tahst feels good to me

[2:13:41] Sindorii: i mean untill rogue is fixed with their perfect toolkit its a wrap for AWC and comps
[2:14:01] Xclosetnerd: all these players quit because the prize pool is/has been pitiful. even winning it all you could make more working at McDonald‚Äôs. imagine dedicating you‚Äôre life to competing, coming in 2nd and being poor
[2:14:34] wisptroll: ^
[2:15:23] Metaphors: statue diff

[2:16:21] LeetSauce_TV: @venruki Can we see the teams competing this awc?
[2:16:30] gelatokush: the ones that still compete is for exposure and not for prize tahst for sure
[2:16:34] ItsBees: This war was talking crap about the heals in our match and how we weren't healing the top dps, then he couldn't even kill a DH on his own when the other healer dc'd LUL
[2:16:42] Cuhrismuh: That‚Äôs a fair point.. I‚Äôve found a lot of streamers from playing AWC lol
[2:16:48] Metaphors: lets call it what it is. WoW esports is community softball.
[2:17:44] happyheals: that kind of stuff could change with new ownership
[2:17:50] Sosatko: Man the new dk set looks insane

[2:24:37] Raubski: whatre shuffle queues like this season compared to last?
[2:25:54] krisdahaka: KEKW
[2:26:30] Yoruus: @venruki Consider playing Safeguard when you know your teammate is gonna get trained.
[2:26:33] Ahbadah: still best in lobby
[2:26:43] Sokkee: DK needs an hardnerf on interrrupts for cater
[2:26:59] LeetSauce_TV: Yeah, the hurricane build is just so good in shuffles tbh.
[2:27:01] Jrexlol: DHs need more nerf LUL
[2:27:03] happyheals: Beyblade Ven
[2:27:03] Ronn_Deezy: do teacups normally spin
[2:27:13] nikthevoker: YUP
[2:27:18] zachgamegodx: smexxin is great player but he does weird builds on all his guys that most of us cant pull off..like the crit haste evoker
[2:27:19] nikthevoker: thats how i push LUL
[2:27:39] davErosEe: solo shuffle is like raiding against players, all about dmg output
[2:28:42] Yoruus: So true but "Safeguard" has flat dmg reduction on it, really good in my opinion.
[2:31:36] theboltyy: \m/
[2:34:12] yesterday_potato: he said number 1 but its looking like number 2
[2:34:24] QuonDot: rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy

[2:42:11] ItsBees: Ven have you seen all the Kit Kat flavors Japan has? It's nuts
[2:42:16] NozakGaming: Ven, do you think healer imbalance (mainly resto druid outlier) is one of the major contributing factors to the lack of healers willing to que shuffle?
[2:42:17] xSavageALx: Are you a fan of priest in arenas?
[2:42:21] Axtin: chips are so weird like u dont feel lousy until the moment u finish the bag
[2:42:37] happyheals: I tried a frosted donut kit kat and it was gross

[2:43:37] woossaahh: best snack for me is mango, strawberry, peach, xanthan gum, vanilla or strawberry protein powder, greek yogurt, ice blended up into a protein ice cream. so good, filling and low calories
[2:43:38] happyheals: I got into them when they were on the Little Nicky Soundtrack
[2:43:57] Axtin: i like those with just cheese
[2:44:03] NozakGaming: @Hizuru1 got 1800 on disc and havent logged on it since lol. If i see a resto druid is almost and guaranteed loss to me unless one dps is going 0-6.

[2:48:10] Plan: that sounds very unfun, like not a fun thing to introduce at all
[2:48:10] Shezzmou: healers are so strong already
[2:48:16] GoblinRekka: if you play healer you gotta love to heal
[2:48:24] happyheals: people need to play healers more and get better at them
[2:48:31] GoblinRekka: sounds like they have the wow problem of not knowing how to make healing fun
[2:48:32] SteLawBro: Constant healing or is it like out of combat?
[2:48:35] QuonDot: try 1v1 a moira....lol
[2:48:54] happyheals: I like Ana in HOTS
[2:49:12] Hizuru1: Overwatch support> wow healers.

[2:49:39] Biscuitboyusa: healing in OW is super chill honestly
[2:49:44] justaguy34921: is there any world where healing bots, like in the new patch for pve, is a good idea? for pvp?
[2:49:47] yowler_: they could try a similar thing in wow -- make healers do very meaningful dam and lower overall dam for other roles a bit to make killing things / staying alive a full team thing
[2:49:51] happyheals: wow healing was fun when kittyweaving was the real deal
[2:49:51] modsbruto: any ideas from overwatch we could apply in wow to make healing funnier ?
[2:49:53] happyheals: bfa
[2:50:12] yowler_: yep exactly
[2:50:15] blightclub: Ana is goated
[2:50:15] bransby09: Lucio is meh

[2:52:17] modsbruto: cant figure why
[2:52:52] happyheals: it was the venthyr execute
[2:52:59] nightmxz: Man if you used conditional macros back then you could have only used it when it would get cd shortened lmao
[2:53:09] Axtin: i remember farming reaping resets off demo imps
[2:53:22] Axtin: then they nerfed it

[2:54:54] Chaskw: What does the new pvp enchant look like? havent seen it anywhere
[2:54:55] mrxilio: agree
[2:54:56] happyheals: I mean marks
[2:54:56] OMGWhatsHisFace: nooo way
[2:55:00] GoblinRekka: trash
[2:55:17] deafnflaccid: cant get the elite set unless they bring back s1 for xmog next patch
[2:55:18] mrxilio: wish you could get gold for them lol
[2:55:22] happyheals: you can go to old expac pvp areas andc buy the old sets
[2:55:22] ziloclol: cant get it
[2:55:22] Axtin: we should be able to sell marks of honor on the auction house
[2:55:40] Axtin: ya tru
[2:55:41] woossaahh: @venruki can i drop a imgur link with a recipe for someone in chat?
[2:55:43] QuonDot: Ven would be RICH
[2:55:53] mrxilio: @Axtin agreed. or at least have "pouches of gold" to purchase with them
[2:55:54] CmxtheWW: If you download better wardrobe you can see all the old elite sets
[2:55:55] venruki: !permit woossaahh
[2:55:55] StreamElements: @woossaahh, you will not get timed out for the next 60 seconds.
[2:55:55] Moobot: @venruki @woossaahh will not get timed out for the next 3m (@venruki)
[2:56:00] woossaahh: @jontepman https://imgur.com/a/8bsYyI2
[2:56:21] QuonDot: @venruki how do you feel about PVP getting taken out of vault in next xpac?
[2:56:42] mrxilio: @QuonDot wait what?
[2:56:45] Chadww: Didn't they just say you get more conquest
[2:56:46] xilyx2: there is no vault next xpac at all is there?
[2:56:47] mmarkers: they said more conq
[2:56:49] nightmxz: They said they're going to increase conquest amounts every week
[2:56:52] Reiumi_: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:56:53] GoblinRekka: im all for it with a suitable replacement like no conquest cap right away
[2:56:54] happyheals: you can get all the shadowlands sets at the old vendor
[2:56:55] QuonDot: I think they said conquest buffs for winning / playing games
[2:57:00] ledpredatorx: do warrs slap?
[2:57:01] CmxtheWW: vault is dumb, it takes away rng aspect in pvp. so that‚Äôs a W
[2:57:05] asloff: taking rng out of gearing is a W imo, even if it slows the gearing progression
[2:57:07] zachgamegodx: i walked my dog and im still inq, vens hack worked
[2:57:07] Hizuru1: @QuonDot even less people will play first few months of season KEKW
[2:57:08] OMGWhatsHisFace: @CmxtheWW exactly
[2:57:08] zachgamegodx: thanks ven
[2:57:12] Anarkus: Been a bit since I've popped in on a stream. Do you still play WW?
[2:57:16] danieljjohnsonn: is there any patch notes for next week?
[2:57:18] QuonDot: @Hizuru1 you like the vault?
[2:57:21] mkass_f_1: prove it
[2:57:22] ryanlane_: Can you briefly explain war rotation
[2:57:40] ledpredatorx: another bs???
[2:57:41] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy woossaahh WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:57:42] asloff: you rocking the 4 set?
[2:57:44] ledpredatorx: nice
[2:57:49] ryanlane_: Do you ever press slam
[2:57:51] Hizuru1: @QuonDot dont like how they made everything unrewarding and just weekly pity, why play early with currency and progression throttle when you can just play last month without it
[2:57:56] asloff: @ryanlane_ no
[2:58:01] Axtin: arms rotation seems impossible to mess up
[2:58:14] gelatokush: lol
[2:58:15] CmxtheWW: theres no such thing as arms rotation
[2:58:32] TheEyeVII: theyre taking it out cuz right now if you pve/pvp you get punished by vault in both activities, they could've done the double vaults from bfa too
[2:58:34] Magottx: Weekend coffee Pog
[2:58:39] gelatokush: 2 buttons
[2:58:41] skez_live: it is spammy though, wasnt my favorite
[2:58:41] zachgamegodx: @Axtin you tihnk that, but it's actually pretty complex i swear
[2:58:46] marvin1995xo: doesnt flow
[2:58:49] QuonDot: @Hizuru1 I just dont like maxing a vault out 3 weeks straight and not getting any good gear. Wish there was something gave u guaranteed better gear. rather then RNG
[2:58:49] m1scl1ck: Im a fury warrior but wanna try arms. fury is super spammy..
[2:58:49] ledpredatorx: yeah
[2:58:51] gelatokush: overpower ms overpower ms
[2:58:53] kashmoney31: 100% agree on war
[2:58:59] theboltyy: I may try a warrior
[2:59:01] danieljjohnsonn: i think Warrior is perfectly tuned right now tbh
[2:59:02] modsbruto: you're a 100% right, mr.ruki
[2:59:06] Datguyjay: warriors are actually fine big agree
[2:59:12] CmxtheWW: yeah ofc they are broken asf every patch
[2:59:14] Lleo00: its got a good toolkit
[2:59:16] modsbruto: besides we look cool af
[2:59:18] hollow1zed: except slam which is useless
[2:59:18] Lleo00: simple but effective
[2:59:19] modsbruto: manliest class ever
[2:59:21] backstreetalright: I think fury is more advanced
[2:59:22] isseswagger: top 3 most played spec isnt it
[2:59:22] gelatokush: war is not broken tf
[2:59:23] Magottx: No you get rewarded for stacking overpower to line up with smash and hurricane stuff I love it
[2:59:23] danieljjohnsonn: DH/Monk and ALL pet classes need fixingü§£
[2:59:25] GoblinRekka: im no good at them so obviously they suck
[2:59:27] Azzulon: @gelatokush you just dont know what you talking about
[2:59:28] Hizuru1: @QuonDot unsub and play last month of season when you can bul all gear with conquest by playing how long you want
[2:59:32] Vimosa: in pvp they are good, but designed around the legendary in pve
[2:59:40] zachgamegodx: the thing is, warrior's end up doing the same dmg no matter how they play it, but the ones who are doing good ability prio will have more single target dmg and mortals trike and less pad dmg
[2:59:43] mrshowtyme: War feels good with any stat build as well.
[2:59:47] shugguls: warrior is about the 4th best melee
[2:59:48] CmxtheWW: they are the worst spec in PvE rn
[2:59:52] GoblinRekka: need you that big legendary axe
[3:00:03] QuonDot: @Hizuru1 LUL
[3:00:08] zachgamegodx: rings..
[3:00:09] Notty21: ive seen some warriros recently running no sharpen build is that real or a meme?
[3:00:10] theboltyy: Isn't there a rogue warrior with sod or something
[3:00:12] ledpredatorx: trinket!
[3:00:13] ShaHugs: jewelry slot
[3:00:14] Axtin: craft a ring
[3:00:15] asloff: second haste ring
[3:00:17] Anarkus: Hey Ven, been a bit since I've popped in a stream. Play monk at all
[3:00:18] backstreetalright: more epics!
[3:00:18] dmason828: ya'll ever gottena  triple dps SS lobby? currently in one
[3:00:22] Anarkus: ?
[3:00:23] ledpredatorx: trinket gives most value right
[3:00:28] modsbruto: craft ring or maybe STR trinket, mr.ruki
[3:00:29] gelatokush: no sharpen for sweaty 3s into rmp
[3:00:32] asloff: yeah bleed ticks for execute procs
[3:00:35] gelatokush: but i dont change it
[3:00:45] ledpredatorx: hahahah freeedom
[3:00:50] Plan: Madge take that queue
[3:00:50] ledpredatorx: mastery has to be bis
[3:01:10] Hizuru1: @QuonDot and quite sure next season there are not even new sets so why even play now KEKW
[3:01:31] modsbruto: 20-30%ish haste
[3:01:31] seraph_wow: Vonruki Pog
[3:01:32] Magottx: Haste to 30 then mastery
[3:01:34] modsbruto: then all mast
[3:01:34] Azzulon: 30
[3:01:34] Madjeckyl: Magnusz said if you're fast, go full haste vers.
[3:01:38] dropbombsss: 30/30 is pog
[3:01:43] happyheals: Strength; Versatility; Haste=Mastery; Critical Strike
[3:01:51] YoMamaSoFine69: the #1 eu arms goes 80%mastery
[3:02:00] backstreetalright: I personally like more haste to depreciate my keyboard faster
[3:02:07] YoMamaSoFine69: like gear wise 80% of his gear is mastery/vers
[3:02:08] that_man_ski: 30/30 sounds good actually
[3:02:10] theboltyy: I actually will do a reg warrior lol a rogue seems chep
[3:02:17] gelatokush: same i dont liek low hast i liek 30/30
[3:02:19] ledpredatorx: mastery is just more damage %
[3:02:21] ledpredatorx: right
[3:02:23] ShaHugs: magnus has 36% haste/30% mast outside of pvp
[3:02:28] YoMamaSoFine69: @CamilliWoWWZ but eu is > na
[3:02:30] skez_live: I have an extra set of keycaps i need to use so I like haste
[3:02:35] modsbruto: you cool arelady in haste
[3:02:37] modsbruto: go mast
[3:02:38] ledpredatorx: maybe 5% less vers
[3:02:47] Yoruus: @venruki It's personal preference. I think Mastery is better then haste cause you'r uptime will be less and less the higher rank you go. So you hit Hard, butt less often.
[3:02:47] wyldeshock: msg potato and call him an ape for me
[3:02:52] modsbruto: pros are doing exactly that, mr.ruki
[3:03:02] RubberFeral: Do you have playlist to your music? please ;)
[3:03:07] ShaHugs: haste/mast rings op
[3:03:07] gelatokush: i dont recoment 30% vers for war unless u play with a r1 healer
[3:03:15] Madjeckyl: More haste = more procs
[3:03:17] ledpredatorx: global cooldown of mashing abilities
[3:03:19] happyheals: faster attacks, faster cds and more rage
[3:03:20] YoMamaSoFine69: more apm
[3:03:20] Madjeckyl: More procs = more damage
[3:03:30] asloff: rend ticks can proc execute
[3:03:34] skez_live: Most people craft Signet of Titanic insight with haste, mastery
[3:03:37] asloff: execute>all
[3:03:45] happyheals: bleed procs can give rage
[3:03:51] happyheals: if you spec it
[3:04:09] Plan: <-
[3:04:15] asloff: how often are you pressing rend?
[3:04:19] ledpredatorx: a ring the likes of which No one has done before
[3:04:33] Tridos_: 15k gold I got you
[3:04:38] TheEyeVII: no AH mount?
[3:04:40] asloff: gucci
[3:04:56] Tridos_: I kid I cant even recraft it
[3:04:56] Cdenzy: you still need a spark for that right
[3:05:06] zachgamegodx: babooshka's "christmas" bonus on tip is 500g
[3:05:10] asloff: @Cdenzy yes
[3:05:11] zachgamegodx: and that's a happy new year too
[3:05:20] happyheals: yeah a spark and the item ffrom the conq vendor
[3:05:21] GoblinRekka: only guildies can recraft or personal
[3:05:27] GoblinRekka: on the work board
[3:05:32] zachgamegodx: ven, just make a new ring it's like the same price and u can public order it
[3:05:38] Cdenzy: oh ok I completely made new ones so thought i was dumb
[3:05:46] Chadww: My rogue can but he's on Illidan
[3:05:55] gelatokush: rings are so cheap to make people usually just craft a new one and put it public
[3:05:58] ShaHugs: 3-5k
[3:05:58] mrshowtyme: 5k
[3:06:04] ilareem_7u: 1 raiders from ilareem_7u have joined! 
[3:06:05] happyheals: I gave like 5k for the ring recrafts
[3:06:14] MaybeRespect: Anything. They just press button.
[3:06:14] LeHellman: Im EU, otherwise I do it
[3:06:16] MaybeRespect: Lol
[3:06:16] zachgamegodx: if ui tip 5k on a recraft instead of making a new one then you deserve to be scammed
[3:06:19] GoblinRekka: 5k is crazy
[3:06:28] asloff: i tip 1k, everytime

[3:11:54] ledpredatorx: MorphinTime CurseLit BOP CurseLit BOP CurseLit MorphinTime
[3:12:02] Duecesz: @omtatsat its pvp ilvl is still the same

[3:12:23] omtatsat: Thanks
[3:12:33] Duecesz: @asloff no
[3:12:39] happyheals: enchants matter

[3:13:35] asloff: @OMGWhatsHisFace in pvp combat* it wont shoot up in ilvl in the raid
[3:14:09] OMGWhatsHisFace: so there's like no point in even spending conq on rings
[3:14:31] ledpredatorx: lol
