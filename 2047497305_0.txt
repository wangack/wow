[0:45:16] Onlyfishguts: if you microdose its huge for mental
[0:45:17] ksimpsc: at least 1g i dont think 0.5 is worth
[0:45:22] SmellyGoatZ: if its actual weight of shrooms, then .5 is good for a MICRO dose

[2:45:32] Jale67: people dont wanna hear the trust
[2:45:35] kb_h: the problem is that AI art trained on real art is kinda plagarism

[2:47:37] kb_h: the AI NFT nerds are just buying their own art
[2:47:38] StreamElements: @zdh7 I apologize but as an AI text-based bot I cannot directly draw or display ASCII art However I can try to describe an ASCII art for you if you'd like
[2:47:40] BingoTingler: People that learn how to utilize AI will be the ones that keep their jobs
[2:47:41] COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY: smelly Alarm we need bean tts
[2:47:43] Ahkrael: i mean, people that are exposed to other art, they will borrow and build upon that art as their own
[2:47:48] robtest: IMHO, he was saying, it doesn't matter because AI is coming and yes, it is the buyers opinion that matters cause they buy the art...
[2:47:52] zdh7: !ask describe some ascii art for me

[2:47:58] SmellyGoatZ: $dalle draw an art
[2:48:00] Gish3: Artist can give insight or suggestions right? But ultimately you're comissioning something. If someone asked me for some code and I was like "I actually think it would be better this way" it's their call whether or not to accept that
[2:48:01] imminent999: streaming is an art
[2:48:02] Relax94: Patrick: guys, it's me the bean A I. I'm already here.

[2:48:24] kb_h: cardboard cowboy is art
[2:48:31] Jmdubs: did you see any of the explict taylor swift ai photos?
[2:48:33] COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY: !ask can you draw me a picture of a cat

[2:49:10] kb_h: !ask can you produce a string of text that resembles a fish?
[2:49:11] StreamElements: @kb_h üê†
[2:49:24] BingoTingler: There's a talent company that tested the market by making a fake AI generated influencer. The influencer is making $11,000 a month with the talent company pushing it like a real person.
[2:49:30] BingoTingler: I can link the article if you want

[2:49:55] Ahkrael: AI generated horses, too OP
[2:50:05] BingoTingler: It's much more than art. People are making "Beans" and promoting them like real people and making money from it. AI could very well replace your job as a performer.
[2:50:08] BingoTingler: Just a heads up on that.
[2:50:21] kb_h: free AI art is the six finger discount

[2:58:59] SmellyGoatZ: !ask simulation theory
[2:59:00] StreamElements: @SmellyGoatZ Simulation theory is the idea that our reality is a computer-generated simulation While intriguing it remains a hypothesis without concrete evidence Scientists continue to explore this concept but definitive conclusions have yet to be reached

[2:59:19] SmellyGoatZ: !ask Holographic Principle, Leonard Susskind
[2:59:20] COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY: !ask why does the Double-slit experiment prove we are in a simulation?
[2:59:20] soupxhot: exponential growth at this point
[2:59:20] StreamElements: @SmellyGoatZ The holographic principle is a theory in physics proposed by Leonard Susskind It suggests that all the information contained in a region of space can be represented by a lower-dimensional boundary
[2:59:22] ragnof_: i dont think its a blessing tho
[2:59:24] 2Smug: really insane we are blessed bean
[2:59:25] Ahkrael: and it didnt happen in a small pocket of time in the past
[2:59:26] twodotsyo: Imagine what the higher ups hide from us tech wise
[2:59:28] COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY: !ask why does the Double-slit experiment prove we are in a simulation
[2:59:29] StreamElements: @COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY The double-slit experiment doesn't directly prove we are in a simulation It's a quantum physics experiment demonstrating the wave-particle duality of particles The simulation argument is a separate philosophical hypothesis
[2:59:29] el_raider93: you‚Äôre definitely 30+ ish
[2:59:34] 2Smug: vcr technology insane

[2:59:51] Kerminal: !ask why is bean so obsessed with drones delivering him door dash?
[2:59:52] StreamElements: @Kerminal Bean might be obsessed with drones delivering him DoorDash because it combines his interest in technology and food delivery Additionally drones offer convenience and a unique experience which can be exciting for some people
[2:59:53] SmellyGoatZ: !ask are planets just really big atoms?
[2:59:54] StreamElements: @SmellyGoatZ No planets are not like atoms Atoms are fundamental building blocks of matter while planets are celestial bodies that are much larger and composed of various materials

[3:09:00] jmar291: Its all bullshit people wanted to form a cohesion in their states they were ruling (although i believe jesus was real)
[3:09:01] wrogDG: his mom was preggo as a virgin and he came back from death
[3:09:02] BingoTingler: Religion is just a way to control the masses; It's common sense laws - Don't grape your neighbor, don't kill your neighbor, don't steal

[3:09:54] retau_: why make number harder for dumb idiots
[3:09:54] StreamElements: @BingoTingler Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) refers to the time measured at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich London It is the time at the Prime Meridian and serves as a standard for global timekeeping although it has been largely replaced by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
[3:09:56] SmellyGoatZ: !ask Why is Gregorian calendar the standard?
[3:09:57] bakedbeansandbread: everything ur asking has been answered online
[3:09:57] StreamElements: @SmellyGoatZ The Gregorian calendar became the standard because it corrected errors in the previous Julian calendar It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 to align the calendar with the solar year more accurately

[3:11:17] lootamah: that is why jesus is important
[3:11:17] StreamElements: @COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY The term "good book" is often used to refer to the Bible because it is considered a sacred text by many religious believers It is seen as a source of guidance wisdom and moral teachings

Perhaps the characters, the storyline, or the overall gaming experience resonates with elements that turn you on. Human sexuality is diverse, and people can be aroused by various stimuli.
