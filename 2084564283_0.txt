[4:02:18] BawlmainCS2: Alot of Danish people are in the wrong belief that we have statutory minimum wage in Denmark. It's a scam and a joke between Unions
[4:02:32] realZORRO: dont know what @treflip420 agenda is, he just tried to exaggerate our wage levels in Sweden.
[4:02:37] xep14: And one question bcs here in Spain we are having may problems. Is the life good between Catolicism and Muslims ? Here is hard af
[4:02:43] MrWiemann: @lurker416 are you danish? if you are, i hope you know there is NOT a minimum wage dictated by LAW. If you are infact danish and do not know this, id suggest you reada beore you talk
[4:02:56] bassiemon123: !gamble 1
[4:02:56] treflip420: @BawlmainCS2 You're right, not by law. My mistake, but you could still get a job in mcdonalds and be obliged to get minimum wage, which is 136 DKK in Denmark due to them being a part of a workingunion, and if they're not paid that they are obliged to get it by LAW due to the agreement between the employer and the workingunion

[4:03:14] lurker416: Ok, I checked in out in danish (which I can read) both in danish and Norway there is actually no min. wage by law
[4:03:15] playertorbmain: i wish bulgaria wasnt on the other side of the world from the united states cuz i'd pay it a visit
[4:03:23] shubic: I think it's wrong that there's even a "minimum" considering you're trading your time for it

[4:04:18] StreamElements: Check out and subscribe to my YouTube channel! -> https://www.youtube.com/psheor
[4:04:29] lurker416: apparently both in DK and Norway the minimum pay is negotiated by workers unions, and it's done between workers union and trade union. Seems like the govt. is out of the picture
[4:05:15] Leadstar1212: @PsheroTV permit me to submit a link please
[4:05:23] SneakingPeacock: You usually get paid more in the big city
[4:05:28] Mista_Salt: Fresh shave looking clean brother.
[4:05:33] elboksen: @lurker416 basicly the company has a deal with the union which makes them have to follow their wage guidelines or the employee can "sue" etc, in very basic level this is whats minimum wage is about
[4:05:38] Timpietim: Shruge
[4:05:39] rainmannxz: sounds like someone taking advantage of someone else LUL
[4:05:46] Speyto: The average wage is higher in Stockholm than other parts of the country for the same job, by 10-15% for example

[4:06:32] Leadstar1212: I am east coast Bulgaria
[4:06:34] insomniaa24: @neoqube Hello from Ternopil :D
[4:06:43] lurker416: @elboksen yeah I saw that, just kinda surprising there is no law mandating it. cause I think the lowest wages in DK are quite high compared to say other western countries
[4:06:45] neoqube: @insomniaa24 Hi :)
[4:06:59] ChrisarN: Norway have  high wages, but everything cost ALOT in Norway aswell.
[4:07:16] Leadstar1212: @PsheroTV try shumen number 10

[4:07:34] Kyos_wow: @PsheroTV What do you recommend to visit in Bulgaria?
[4:07:34] elboksen: @lurker416 true but thats most of scandinavia. I mean if u work below "minimum wage" its ur own fault. most companies will pay u above it, in my experience atleast
[4:07:45] HeinMuck: ITS THE DARN EURO KKona

[4:08:28] Leadstar1212: @PsheroTV  I actually cannot economically explain this but isn't connect with infrastructure and business competition?
[4:08:34] Rageneration: because for a store to run in sofia is more expensive to run in another city
[4:08:37] insomniaa24: You include rent in a price of rice dah?
[4:08:44] Stinkfoots: its always way more expensive to rent or buy a place to live
[4:08:49] lurker416: I thought that chatter actually copy pasted a paragraph from a law, what a clown to copy stuff off someones wishful blog lol @BawlmainCS2
[4:08:55] Stinkfoots: in the big citys
[4:08:57] AnguishTM: Busy city / capital = chance of ppl buying it will be higher, so u can fluctuate the prices that way.
[4:09:08] BawlmainCS2: @lurker416 Denmark cannot make a law on minimum wage - it's on EU regulation level and there is NO minimum wage regulation as of 2024.

[4:10:44] lurker416: which in itself is clowning, i mean it sounded good what he posted but if it's not real then it's no good @BawlmainCS2
[4:11:11] moneynight2000: sweet blizz put a lot of effort in this endgame in sod

[4:11:20] elboksen: @lurker416 well its "real" to whatever companies have a deal with that specific unions. we have many unions for diffrent work areas and they all have diffrent numbers
[4:11:28] HeinMuck: YES IT IS, MY PROFESSOR IS CALLED Tsvetan Tsvetanov and he si Bulgarian

[4:11:50] Cocka03: it's a trap !
[4:11:55] lurker416: this is true, but they do have to negotiate and set it in contract @elboksen they can't just imply its the law
[4:12:21] miroslavisikiyski: that too.. there are thousands of people named the same name and surname
[4:12:24] HeinMuck: Can you sum up bulgarian lore of the past 100 years
[4:12:26] moneynight2000: poor gnome
[4:12:27] BawlmainCS2: @elboksen yup - and no employer is obliged to be part of said unions
[4:12:32] elboksen: @lurker416 yy ofc, hence the "deal the companies have with that specific union" :D
[4:12:32] treflip420: @lurker416 Yeah I didnt read properly on it, by law there is no minimum wage. But by law you are obliged to get the minimum wage if your employer has an agreement with a workers union, which about 75% of the private sector is covered by.

[4:12:57] fabx0c: the selling price of a random company is the same everywhere, its just the local distributors increasing the prices within the legal limit for profit
[4:13:18] HeinMuck: fair
[4:13:21] KamoChameleon: Do you think there is a difference in pvp talent between the factions? Like do you think there are more PVErs on Alliance for example and more PVPers on Horde?
[4:13:25] lurker416: @treflip420 good thing we sorted that out tho. could be that many ppl think there is some minimum they just have to be paid, with no basis
[4:14:05] markclent: Does a lvl 39 have the same power of a lvl 40?
[4:14:13] RyanMcGoose: as long as you arent losing your "full price" customers you dont lose anything to access a lesser market
[4:14:13] elboksen: @BawlmainCS2 true, but 3F will just do a lockdown on companies etc, saw it so many times in my work areas, fucking mafia methods
[4:14:18] Leadstar1212: @PsheroTV I was thinking wouldn't salaries insntatly increase in small towns if infrastructure such as trains gets improved and  you can easily go from Dobrich, Razgrad and Shumen to work  in Varna with the  new Siemens trains that go to  200km/h

[4:16:19] BawlmainCS2: @Leadstar1212 It's an interesting point - but I think not. Infrastructure, super markets etc. in small towns will increase housing prices but most people aren't working in the same town (especially in the suburbs).
[4:16:41] LoKuhMuhTive: @uldaman700 Cata wasnt the best but lets be honest RBG for the first time was really cool
