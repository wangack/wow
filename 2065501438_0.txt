[0:03:32] TheLosmy: What do you think about SoD vs wotlk?? I'm not a fan of vanilla classic because of the "slower" pvp, but with SoD it feels slightly faster but not as fast as wotlk

[0:10:07] canaryofc: you think mind spike/plague buffs will match nerf to death dmg in pve?
[0:10:10] Landon_MDL: what do you think about feral burst
[0:10:14] Hyrionz: @Marcus2234 wsd getting nerf and 2 other buttons +10% more, so idk why ppl say its nerf
[0:10:20] cheframsaylol: when will be the nerf active?
[0:10:29] canaryofc: tuesday @cheframsaylol
[0:10:49] 7idus: its like 20dps nerf tops

[0:12:49] Hyrionz: @Ronstopppable its not in game
[0:12:51] Marcus2234: not up yet
[0:12:55] Ronstopppable: oh really?
[0:13:17] guni1980: But werent they buffing other dots?
[0:13:23] Ronstopppable: 40% base and 30% scaling nerf seemed pretty harsh that was a bigger nerf then starsurge
[0:13:44] Goldfit123: void felt pretty ok
[0:13:45] Ronstopppable: void didnt need buffed lol
[0:14:07] ahyepz: their reasoning behind the nerf was that there is no counter. kind of the same with void plague lmao
[0:14:21] Glitchmoo: Are you not running twisted faith in raids?
[0:14:27] Skipiz852: @ahyepz u can remove void
[0:14:28] vrsswow: How much swd is gona get nerfed ?
[0:14:33] Rogodal04: @ahyepz void atleast can be dispelled
[0:14:40] Hyrionz: @vrsswow just read on wowhead
[0:14:43] Marcus2234: they shouldve made it 25% and 5% more
[0:14:46] ahyepz: @Skipiz852 thats why i said kind of
[0:14:52] sterikacid: yeah void plague is a disease so can be removed
[0:14:58] vrsswow: @Hyrionz my country is banned on wowhead
[0:15:00] Unhip_: !restedxp

[0:15:02] vrsswow: thats why i asking
[0:15:05] Marcus2234: wait hunter stays like this√ü
[0:15:13] Hyrionz: @vrsswow  Shadow Word: Death base damage before modifiers decreased by 40% and spellpower coefficient adusted to 42.9% (was 64.3%).
[0:15:23] Hyrionz: @vrsswow  Mind Spike damage increased by 10%.  Void Plague damage increased by 10%.
[0:15:45] Iceshare: is mind spike worth using in pvp and while questing?
[0:15:47] Skipiz852: we will def go down in pve dps
[0:15:54] isheria: guess the nerf had to come LUL
[0:16:14] sterikacid: I kinda think it's ok that SWD is a bit OP, it's inherently risky to use because of the chance for it to backfire...
[0:16:18] xou333: that addon for dots is weakauras?
[0:16:19] ahyepz: the nerf wont hit that hard in pve. its around 5% nerf to overall
[0:16:32] Hyrionz: @xou333 yes i think
[0:16:53] Waterwalk: spell coeff not that big, anyways since casters don't have that much sp anyways ,the direct dmg allrighty,but dp gonna scale really well now
[0:16:56] DeathToad007: cany beieve theyare buffin void plauge lol gonna tick for 200
[0:16:57] Mystiggo: I was expecting more of a 25% nerf and 20% more to mind spike. Straight up pve nerf feels pretty bad when mages and locks are already far ahead
[0:16:58] Waterwalk: VP*
[0:17:10] Skipiz852: @ahyepz how is it 5% its like top 3 ability used and nerfed by almost half
[0:17:18] Skipiz852: well top 3 damage ability
[0:17:22] Lillbrampa: Is this on US?
[0:17:26] SippinSimpSyrup: @Waterwalk the gear that drops in gnomer has the same spell power as mc gear...
[0:17:29] Hyrionz: @Lillbrampa yes
[0:17:43] ahyepz: mind spike and void plague is at same damage percentage if u look at logs. its the pve nerds who made the calculations on priest disc
[0:17:50] Skipiz852: @Mystiggo yea thinking same

[0:19:58] Mystiggo: and obviously their aoe is outrageous
[0:19:59] guni1980: But now layering is bugged, so often groups are on different layers
[0:20:15] Hyrionz: @guni1980 yeah just have to relog like 20times to be on same Kappa

[0:20:51] SippinSimpSyrup: @Mystiggo lets just say thats true, spriest is a pvp god, so what if mage is better then spriest in pve? one class is good at one thing and the other is good at the other thing. why does one class have to be good at everything?
[0:20:53] Skipiz852: just hope we dont become the worst caster to bring to gnomer, we do have the healing  with vampiric that we bring I guess

[0:21:40] Mystiggo: @SippinSimpSyrup don't need to "say" anything is true, you can look at the numbers
[0:21:58] SippinSimpSyrup: @Mystiggo didnt address what i said at all, its an L
[0:22:05] xou333: that phone verification on discord though...
[0:22:10] Kreynz: thoughts on the priest changes?
[0:22:13] Hyrionz: @bomzzwtf he sayd its totally fine
[0:22:32] Iceshare: @Hydramist Which addon shows dispelable buffs in a highlight on target frames?
[0:22:43] bomzzwtf: I feel like they priests will drop in pve
[0:23:04] Kreynz: it doesn't matter if spriest is bottom dps you will still want 1 in pve
[0:23:08] Mystiggo: @SippinSimpSyrup Yes I stopped reading after you ignored facts and statistics FeelsOkayMan
[0:23:15] Gallowxyz: @Iceshare Its ClassicAuraDurations, the highlight is a custom edit though
[0:23:20] ephixa_fan: good evening
[0:23:37] SippinSimpSyrup: @Mystiggo quite the opposite, i conceded them, glad you have a 2 year olds reading comprehension
[0:23:37] Iceshare: @Mystiggo thanks
[0:23:55] Mystiggo: Spike buff is going to be about 10 dps. death nerf is ~ 40 dps we lost
[0:24:24] Hyrionz: @Mystiggo so you want to say sp its not op right now or what ?)))

[0:26:54] hemsho: Void Plague gonna tick for 300dmg brother
[0:26:55] bassiemon123: HeyGuys
[0:27:21] Lawzvnr: does anyone know why he got omega over every nameplate, and why he hides everyone names, replace by class/party? Got no sound can't hear him
[0:27:28] Kreynz: feel like they should nerf void plague, but then make each stack of mind spike buff its dmg back up
[0:27:32] Kaldakwow: Tehy nerfed the coeffecient for VP didn't they?
[0:27:34] Kreynz: so u can't just 36 yard void plague people
[0:27:47] mrbirman: hey hydra whats that Shadow Word death caller on the targets
[0:27:57] kmi_00_: As far as I understand blizzard does not allow addons for targetting. With exception of party, arena, targettarget etc. which are already possible with macros so thats ok. Restet xp does mob targeting by name by creating macros on the fly for each mob, but thats only possible out of combat.
[0:28:02] Synaltys: Is the priest's nerves verry bad?
[0:28:03] bassiemon123: Im surprised warrior are not part of the new hotfixes

[0:28:23] mrbirman: is that like a weakaura that notifies you to cast SWD ?
[0:28:27] Ronstopppable: Was SWD hitting harder then Starsurge? Was wondering why it got nerfed harder then starsurge, SWD has drawbacks like half damage taken and less range, seems weird
[0:28:41] Ronstopppable: also twice the CD
[0:28:47] Lawzvnr: @kmi_00_ thx, sounds weird
[0:28:50] Kreynz: swd didn't get nerfed as hard as starsurge
[0:28:59] wurkos: instant cast spell shouldn't do that much dmg
[0:29:06] Ronstopppable: It didnt?
[0:29:10] Kreynz: starsurge went from 100% sp scaling to 40% or something, swd went from 60% to 40%
[0:29:16] Kreynz: something like that anyway
[0:29:19] mrbirman: Like on top of the enemies I se SWD icon, like reminding you to cast SWD
[0:29:21] z1toxx: Who is the lock? I need lock pvp build ;(
[0:29:24] mrbirman: whats thaaat BuddhaBar
[0:29:31] Ronstopppable: SWD aalso got a 40% base nerf as well
[0:29:31] fitzgeraldn: hows the death change looking?
[0:30:06] breadwilton: amateur hour
[0:30:12] Kaldakwow: Void plague also got a spell power coefficient nerf
[0:30:21] Kreynz: the coefficient nerf barely does anything
[0:30:24] Kreynz: went from 120% to 100%
[0:30:25] Kreynz: yes
[0:30:37] wurkos: changes are gonna be live next week rngiht ?
[0:30:39] bassiemon123: I saw the YouTube short, that was 1 juicy crit jeeez
[0:30:42] DanUK_47: Im guessing alot of the very good employees at BLizz have left by now tbh
[0:30:57] Fepersz: which pvp items you need?
[0:31:17] LesGoTV: buffing void plague makes twisted faith build a worse option which limits the playstyle, kinda shit
[0:31:39] Kreynz: i feel like twisted fate should be balanced to be the better single target option
[0:31:42] misstherese: hello
[0:31:47] Kreynz: then you take void plague if you can multi dot with it like on the 2nd last boss
[0:31:58] Sinostra: Hello
[0:32:28] mrbirman: Hydra buddy can you please tell me whats that addon/aura that reminds you to cast SWD when target has low health?
[0:32:41] DanUK_47: Why doesnt BLizz ask for feedback on this before making changes
[0:32:45] wurkos: how much dmg you do with mind spike ?
[0:32:56] Sinostra: i'm good, thanks ! how about you ?
[0:33:02] LesGoTV: @Kreynz it is right now, but with the 10% VP buff, vp will be better for both pve and pvp

[0:39:32] Landon_MDL: yeah
[0:39:37] Landon_MDL: because they main paladins
[0:39:52] eggsmasher: funny since atleast 2 of them main melee hunters :
[0:39:59] Landon_MDL: thats why they are not nerfing hunters
[0:40:03] Landon_MDL: because they will buff pala
[0:40:07] eggsmasher: but hey buff paladins all they want lets go
[0:40:10] guni1980: What¬¥s with the stange party names? Are you neutralizing them for stream?
[0:40:13] Landon_MDL: and 2 weeks after they will go like " we nerfed hunter"
[0:40:28] Landon_MDL: so pala if ever get a nerf he will be nerfed after a month or so
[0:40:31] Landon_MDL: but i doupt it

[0:40:35] Knewxy: what day? xD
[0:40:38] eggsmasher: paladin dont need a nerf tho
[0:40:52] hughjasses: they should add a slow onto mind spike because of its frost aspect
[0:40:52] kimuratrap4life: Yes the SWD nerf is correct but do you think the buffs on spike adn plague will be enough to keep uss relevant on the dps meters? Do we scale enough?

[0:59:28] solstixeK1: truer
[0:59:45] solstixeK1: locks got alot of slow dmg as runes
[0:59:59] solstixeK1: except bolt

[1:01:15] solstixeK1: current lock is so unforgiving comapred to other classes
[1:01:50] solstixeK1: dmg wise locks arent underpowered
[1:02:02] FIREMAGZZ: yea locks do good damage
[1:02:03] solstixeK1: but everything else kinda is, since our p2 heal is just so bad comapred to p1

[1:03:04] FIREMAGZZ: shadow word pain hits as hard as 2 or 3 lock dots
[1:03:09] solstixeK1: locks in pvp is just pve rotation hoping no one targets you

[1:08:41] HunterEZ: The way real madrid got their little ballsacks tickled by him just doing a little tease... how furious they were after him signing PSG again
[1:08:48] HunterEZ: What if he did something similar again
[1:09:20] bassiemon123: Hmm been looking for some open world pvp. Stv is bit to mutch of a shitshow, think ill roam badlands a bit.
[1:09:29] Kreynz: they would need to reduce any cc longer than 10 sec (sheep etc.) for arena to be playable (for 2v2/3v3)
[1:09:43] 64hooks: hell yeah bro que'd into your game
[1:09:45] 64hooks: lets go
[1:09:49] Quaerox: it's so weird to play arena in sod because there is no focus frame
[1:09:50] solstixeK1: I long for UA and pandemic with our kit for 50, locks gonna pop
[1:10:13] TheN811: @Hydramist would be amazing

[1:35:09] g_1_t: the lumber is for WSG rep right?
[1:35:11] perseay797: What's the cost and how much rep?
[1:35:19] Kaekias: what would be good classes to play together with a shadow? wouldn't even know how to decide what to level
[1:35:19] g_1_t: oh nm

[1:35:29] donfinito420: Bro u can do 1 ashen a week
[1:35:33] donfinito420: for 1 k
[1:35:34] 64hooks: yeah they should remove the ashenvale cap maybe to do it
[1:35:56] Kreynz: theres also no reason to have exalted AB til 60 but it's still an easy thing to do
[1:35:59] Devii7: did you spend oyur lumber?
[1:36:05] Kreynz: but yer i agree you should be able to turn in for WSG rep as well
[1:36:13] Devii7: sweet
[1:36:24] 64hooks: its just belt right? for rep this phase
[1:36:26] perseay797: Wth how much coins did all that lumber cost? @Hydramist
[1:36:52] Kreynz: yep all you really need is honoured, I don't think the move speed boots stack with the enchant? I might be wrong tho
[1:37:00] 64hooks: yeah i wonder if they will nerf it

[2:00:25] NeVolent: no love for affliction D:
[2:00:48] NeVolent: affl u use ur dots on one person and u are 30% mana :P
[2:00:53] NeVolent: u cant even rot the enemy team
[2:01:07] Mystiggo: good
[2:01:10] varatupaj: lvl 25 void plague does more dmg than 34 corruption :D

[2:01:51] Mystiggo: real and true, sorry to say
[2:01:53] NeVolent: atm priest is far better than affl
[2:01:58] NeVolent: any version of it
[2:02:14] NeVolent: 2 dots that hit harder than 4 lock dots
[2:02:15] gratzitko: well there dots do more then 2x the dmg
[2:02:19] gratzitko: ontop of them having burst
[2:02:28] NeVolent: even rogues dealy poison hits harder haha
[2:02:34] NeVolent: 100+ dmg i think
[2:02:47] gratzitko: yea its sad
[2:02:49] NeVolent: and u got agony hitting for 30 :p
[2:02:59] gratzitko: doubt theyll do anything cuz no 1 complains about it
[2:03:02] Mystiggo: yes, rune spells hit harder than regular spells. that's why destruction is so good at pve. all of their dmg comes from runes
[2:03:05] NeVolent: and if ur drain life gets resisted GG WP haha
[2:03:19] gratzitko: haunt needs to increase dot dmg by like 60% lol
[2:03:22] optik_rec0rds: yeah we only have master channeler thats it
[2:03:22] NeVolent: we are not talkin for pve
[2:03:29] NeVolent: ofc destro is good pve

[2:05:07] gratzitko: u cant sit there n casst a chaos bolt
[2:05:11] NeVolent: @gratzitko i dont like giving 1 spell all the power of the class
[2:05:34] gratzitko: yea
[2:05:36] NeVolent: i would prefer a rune that changes agony and corr buffing them, or siphon life maybe less mana and tick every second
[2:05:43] gratzitko: but how do we get blizz attention?
[2:05:48] NeVolent: you cant hehe
[2:05:51] gratzitko: ;(
[2:05:57] gratzitko: need snutz
[2:06:00] gratzitko: but hes been playing so casually
[2:06:06] NeVolent: how many times i died to mobs or lost a fight cause of drain life resist xD
[2:06:21] NeVolent: cd needs to go, 100% more mana is enough of draw back i think
[2:06:28] gratzitko: im fine with them having a chance to resist drain, but we need dot dmg buffs massivly
[2:06:31] NeVolent: ur filler as warlock is life tap hehe
[2:06:54] gratzitko: ya lock will be good next phaser
[2:06:58] gratzitko: affliction soul link with UA
[2:07:09] gratzitko: but im sure dot dmgwill still be low
[2:07:14] NeVolent: probably yea
[2:07:18] optik_rec0rds: fearbot
[2:07:20] optik_rec0rds: without damage prob
[2:07:40] NeVolent: ye less dmg but u ll have new dot
[2:07:49] NeVolent: so maaaaybe good? dunno
[2:07:56] optik_rec0rds: ua will be strong as its a rune
[2:08:03] gratzitko: only good if they make UA do 3x asmuch dmg as corruption
[2:08:05] optik_rec0rds: all rune dots are like 10 times better than OG dots
[2:08:07] NeVolent: well shadowflame is a rune also :P whats ur point
[2:08:12] gratzitko: otherwise itll still be laughable
[2:08:14] NeVolent: hits for 50
[2:08:17] Kaekias: was looking up tierlists for classes in SoD p2, and they put shadow in d-tier HUH
[2:08:21] gratzitko: shadowflame is pointlesslol wuts thepoint?
