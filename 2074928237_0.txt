[2:17:14] krome2dadome: As part of that, the 50% deduction for business meals was increased to 100% through the end of 2022. But the deduction was temporary, intended to boost the restaurant industry during COVID, and the rules have gone back to a 50% deduction for most business meals.

[3:48:39] devascienos: see Palmour praise of Sterge?
[3:48:56] Anhak: yea mop one of the best feeling xpacs /periods
[3:49:11] devascienos: and mop was linear and could build the story
[3:49:17] Talxo: I'd play MoP again
[3:49:57] Anhak: yea mop had a story but gameplay balance everything just hit perfect
[3:49:59] Drathimos: i quit mop early cause i couldnt even get immersed. it didnt feel like "warcraft"
[3:50:03] Talxo: To this day I still have fond memories of timeless isle
[3:50:05] fxcksteve: mop PvP was soooo fun
[3:50:12] rtcinema: Timeless isle BIS
[3:50:12] bigfathead: MoP was a fresh reboot of the story and had heaps of promise for the future
[3:50:20] dimitridq: the rares and timeless isle and the million little things you could get
[3:50:36] Anhak: the legendary gems/cloaks were a good borrowed power
[3:50:51] rtcinema: The free for all pvp item on timeless isle was a lot of fun
[3:50:53] fxcksteve: I’d do about anything to play mop feral again
[3:51:00] rtcinema: and I miss being able to do things like that without warmode
[3:51:09] Mazerrise: Talkin about "free epic Island"
[3:51:13] bapsspe: hunter was good
[3:51:27] Drathimos: despite all the praise mop got, it was the first expac where a "noticeable" drop of sub players happened
[3:51:31] artsskeit: mop farming.  was amongst my people
[3:51:31] dimitridq: the tiller farm too
[3:51:31] NoChillPrims: dungeons were fun too
[3:51:35] Anhak: mop PVP everything was op the last 2 seasons and just felt so good
[3:51:44] fxcksteve: unholy was super solid in mop if I recall
[3:52:06] Anhak: ppl cringed at the pandas but as ppl played mop i think they enjoyed the story
[3:52:26] theodeth: Need to go back to no story
[3:52:30] Anhak: ALSO ppl froget mop also had an almost gates of AQ even with the war in the barrens and shit
[3:52:37] rtcinema: MOP wasn't trying to make you think you were a god
[3:52:44] Anhak: ^
[3:52:45] Talxo: I like the story of warcraft, not queercraft we have today, world of feelscraft is the biggest L

[3:52:48] rtcinema: Just another adventurer

[3:53:18] michaelss_: feeling like a traveler helping small towns out
[3:53:21] michaelss_: feels good to
[3:53:54] artsskeit: punting some moles
[3:54:11] Talxo: kill 6 wolves in northshire
[3:54:20] beautymustdie1: I just played MoP fresh, it's pretty cool
[3:54:27] cjdtv: love nagrand
[3:54:27] michaelss_: being lvl 5 dwarf in the yeti cavern as a 10 yr old kid
[3:54:28] rtcinema: People are gonna think I'm trolling, but I really liked jailbreak back in the day
[3:54:30] vuldronx: killing the civilians in DK starting zone
[3:54:30] michaelss_: was all time
[3:54:31] theodeth: The one where you turn huuge
[3:54:31] michaelss_: memory
[3:54:37] Anhak: YEA YEA hemet shit i love
[3:54:39] devascienos: kill 30 things each
[3:54:40] rtcinema: It's a chore nowadays, but it was epic back then
[3:54:53] cjdtv: all the nesingwary quests are such nostalgia all the way back to vanilla stv world pvp and dodging shit for agro
[3:55:23] Holtan3111: Does anyone know how i get guaranteed only versa on my crafted Engineering head ?
[3:55:30] devascienos: whirlwind axe quest is up there
[3:55:35] theodeth: Wow goblin starting zone is pretty good
[3:55:57] devascienos: but that’s because the reward was so rewarding to get
[3:55:59] rtcinema: Oh yeah, getting my level 40 mage wand back in vanilla was big too
[3:56:18] rtcinema: I remember trying to solo it for an hour until another mage showed up and we got it done

[4:07:44] Anhak: next AWC at the sphere PauseChamp
[4:08:11] MedtnerFangirl: I prefaced it with strange since I am the only avowed (Revendreth pun) Shadowlands shill
[4:08:26] Anhak: i could see DOTA TI or League worlds doing it just to say they can
[4:08:43] artsskeit: favourite.. most recent expansion?
[4:08:56] johnnythunderbunny: story loses charm when the game is cheeks
[4:09:06] Drathimos: i enjoyed shadowlands. i think people give it too much flack when it was only 9.1 that sucked. that whole korthia patched lasted way too long. BUT 9.0 and 9.2 were generally well received altho ppl forget that.
[4:09:24] Anhak: GoT tv show only has 5 seasons :)
[4:10:14] Devcomz: There was a lot of things I did not like about Shadowlands Lore I felt like it took away from Lore back in WC3 etc and disrespected it
[4:10:32] Devcomz: and early WoW
[4:10:41] Drathimos: shadowlands introduced so many themes and concepts but didnt have enough content to portray those themes so it felt "lacking". there's only so much content they can fit inside of an expac
[4:11:01] Anhak: I didnt buy shadowlands cause i was so frustrated at the companys design choices etc etc and then to have the other stuff ontop i just sat shadowlands out
[4:11:14] Drathimos: each shadowlands realm had enough story that could've been an entire expac
[4:11:24] Landrysdad: left a lot to be desired imo
[4:11:46] Anhak: the covenant stuff litterally because it was tied to player power is why i didnt play that was the final straw
[4:11:51] Drathimos: they should've pitched shadowlands as the start of something new rather than the end of something we knew and then people would've been more forgiving i think
[4:11:52] Devcomz: @Anhak Outside of a few pvp elite mogs I really liked I dont think you missed much. I did like S1 and S2 duelest enchants but alot didnt
[4:12:01] eepshays: they should of just made the primus the bad guy instead
[4:12:29] artsskeit: did you get 4k gold from vendoring all of that
[4:12:32] Devcomz: I am actually excited for War within Lore since it picks up from Legion
[4:12:41] Anhak: they also fucked that tier so hard..
[4:12:47] Landrysdad: for me, I’m a big lore guy, and I was hoping to get “resolution” on some of the old guys and it just didn’t go that way
[4:12:58] Anhak: andy was suppose to be the end boss and shit then randomly had 3 more bosses and the jailer thing
[4:13:20] Anhak: halondrus litterally being the hardest midway boss of all time
[4:13:24] TheBackstabi: I still can't forgive how hard the concept of the Jailor fucked with plotlines of the 3 RTS games
[4:13:43] MedtnerFangirl: I think it would have made sense to introduce him near the end in order to help set up the cosmic struggle in the upcoming trilogy while also having time to establish the parallels with Sargeras
[4:13:45] TheBackstabi: It essentially was turned into forces working for the Jailor vs forces working for the Jailor
[4:13:53] Anhak: @TheBackstabi *waves magical wand* there are no RTS games
[4:13:55] Landrysdad: I really like what they did with grommash for instance
[4:13:55] bapsspe: Honestly the maw killed shadowlands for me and i dont even know what happened in the story
[4:14:26] Drathimos: @Landrysdad the grommash cutscene was the best part of shadowlands

[4:15:23] Drathimos: sorry not grom, meant garrosh
[4:15:33] Landrysdad: garrosh*
[4:15:47] Anhak: Garry was such a good bad guy
[4:15:49] MedtnerFangirl: I wouldn’t have changed the Zereth Mortis patch but it could have worked to have him be introduced there, yeah
[4:15:55] BalancePK_: what up mes what's some good comes for dh?
[4:16:01] Jangoman: Too many "meaningful" choices
[4:16:16] Landrysdad: The way they handled Arthas was god awful
[4:16:21] BalancePK_: comps*
[4:16:32] Anhak: to go back to mop man they made u feel like garry was the bad guy
[4:16:37] Drathimos: garrosh is what made mop story epic and he still kept his epic "death metal" vibe badassery in shadowlands. its what people say that's lacking in DF story
[4:17:01] Jangoman: Garrosh did nothing wrong
[4:17:06] Anhak: yea sometimes doing whats expected and shit is good

[4:17:39] Drathimos: metzen/samwise were "death metal" dudes and that's the roots of warcraft. thats what made people engaged to the warcraft story
[4:17:40] Landrysdad: Garrosh was good because he stayed true to his character with no hidden or alternate motive

[4:19:59] Drathimos: the cool thing about the garrosh cutscene in shadowlands was that it as one single person who volunteered to make it. its why it seemed to scuffed but thats ok because the execution as epic regardless
[4:20:10] artsskeit: @Anhak that dude aint making it through this decade
[4:20:18] Drathimos: was*, my w key is oof
[4:20:38] Anhak: @artsskeit COPIUM he will finish a book
[4:20:53] nickysteph: bs
[4:20:58] artsskeit: a book? yep
[4:21:00] Drathimos: it was a little bit rough on the edges type of jank but it was still ok
[4:21:03] artsskeit: got? nope
[4:21:03] Landrysdad: Well the problem there is by nature that’s not who sylvanas was, so the version of her that woke up would be remorseful
[4:21:06] accessdenn: we need strong orc leaders back
[4:21:19] Anhak: yea he will write some random ass book no one wants KEKW
[4:21:42] Anhak: you know what was slyvanas breaking that mask cause of arthas
[4:21:51] artsskeit: that face is perfect for that sentiment
[4:21:58] Landrysdad: I think it would have been better if through out the her “old” ranger general self comes out at times
[4:22:31] Landrysdad: and impacted decision, because it’s was clear that she’s was always in there
[4:22:44] Drathimos: they brought arthas back for no real reason. it didnt give arthas fans any satisfaction. they did my boy arthas dirty
[4:23:14] Anhak: @Drathimos Illidan>Arthas
[4:23:30] Drathimos: no way, arthas beat illidans ass in wc3
[4:23:47] Anhak: Illidan is alive arthas isnt
[4:23:48] Anhak: EZ
[4:24:08] Landrysdad: to build her there should have been more internal struggle with the ranger general
[4:24:13] Anhak: Kermit: FEEL THE HATRED OF TEN THOUSAND YEARS!
[4:24:28] Landrysdad: They should have visually done it differently with Arthas
[4:24:37] artsskeit: this is all a dream in mishas head as she and rexxar lie down by the coast in desolace
[4:24:58] Anhak: HUH 4 k gold?
[4:24:59] Landrysdad: instead of a whisp it should have been the child version of him that you follow to his heart in wrath
[4:25:08] Drathimos: metzen might redeem arthas in world soul saga when go back to northrend. arthas's "child" soul is still there
[4:25:13] Landrysdad: leave him on a “positive” note
[4:25:31] wowsuomi: This zone looks cool
[4:25:40] Drathimos: not redeem but give him a better "exit" story
[4:26:00] Drathimos: metzens prized character is arthas, i doubt he'll leave it as is
[4:26:33] Anhak: @Drathimos SMOrc what about "green jesus"
[4:26:42] Drathimos: a couple months ago bellular said that he heard rumors that danuser is gone and they'll be retconning a few things out of shadowlands. month later we find out danuser is gone.
[4:26:56] Anhak: I love thrall i find the green jesus/thrall haters funny
[4:26:56] Landrysdad: the uther story line is hot ass as well as
[4:27:08] Mazerrise: Honestly would be great to see arthas redeemed but down the line choose evil yet again. Can't escape his actual fate of being evil

[4:36:27] MedtnerFangirl: not individual sets of architects for each force; First Ones would collectively be a “singular” seventh force

[4:37:29] Jangoman: basically hitch hikers guide the the galaxy
[4:37:37] Drathimos: we dont know if there's an first one for each cosmic force but we do know they're a pantheon above the level of titans
[4:37:39] sunileif: its the titans that are evil
[4:37:42] MedtnerFangirl: yeah, though whether or not they are actually entities remains to be seen
[4:38:14] sunileif: dwarves and humans used to be slaves to the titans til the old gods gave them flesh and therefore free will

[4:39:04] argalanmg: yep i’m in
[4:39:06] sunileif: all hail xalatah!

[4:39:14] sunileif: death to jaina and thrall!
[4:39:14] MedtnerFangirl: but given that our realm in-game is at the confluence of the six forces, and given Azeroth is looking more and more not to be a titan…
[4:39:15] Vtal: Hello discussing lore??
[4:39:33] Drathimos: elune is the front face of the moon while xalatath is the other dark side of the moon.
[4:39:33] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[4:39:55] sunileif: elune is evil
[4:40:11] sunileif: night elves descended from squirells
[4:40:21] sunileif: those poor squirells
[4:40:59] Drathimos: i think xalatath is evil yeah. she's the balancing "counterpart" to elunes benevolence
[4:41:11] Vtal: Will the jailer have smth to do with the titans?
[4:41:22] sunileif: nah they def going with a evil is relative story
[4:41:30] Drathimos: @Vtal no, sargeras will make a return tho
[4:41:37] sunileif: xalatah isnt evil shes fighting the evil titans

[4:42:36] zozoqc: hey @notmes , do you know whats the name of the addon that shows what spell you press in chonologic order? :)
[4:42:37] sunileif: n'zoth too
[4:42:43] Drathimos: @sunileif titans arent evil, they're only acting in "self preservation"
[4:42:55] Drathimos: but yes they are going with morally shades of gray instead of black and white
[4:43:00] sunileif: @Drathimos and we are in the way
[4:43:08] sunileif: expendable
[4:43:14] sunileif: cannon fodder
[4:43:18] Drathimos: titans are going to get algalon'd by the first ones
[4:43:30] Vtal: Whats the jailer power lvl vs titans?
[4:43:32] Drathimos: they have overstayed their welcome
[4:43:34] sunileif: w/e the word for exceptable loses in war is
[4:43:37] devascienos: keepers of the lights space ship to new world after azeroth arc happens
[4:43:47] MedtnerFangirl: I want them to bring the devourers from SL back somehow because they were a neat concept
[4:43:53] sunileif: titans are evil maaan
[4:43:53] Vtal: Since they are from different planes of existence
[4:43:59] Drathimos: @Vtal jailer was described as titan++ but probably because he was empowered by all the anima
[4:44:03] devascienos: want the jailor a titan?
[4:44:06] devascienos: wasnt*
[4:44:16] Drathimos: no he wasnt, hes an eternal one

[4:44:42] Drathimos: titans are a pantheon of the cosmic force of order jailer is part of the pantheon of the cosmic force of death
[4:44:47] MedtnerFangirl: Jailer was part of the Pantheon of Death so the equivalent of a Titan, but yeah empowered by anima
[4:44:49] sunileif: obey your tentacle void lords!
[4:45:00] Vtal: See that narrative is so weird, why would they be bots
[4:45:28] Drathimos: they're not really "bots", its the "afterlife". the body is not important. is the soul thats important. the body is just a vessel in the afterlife much like how death knights are vessels for an external soul
[4:45:31] sunileif: its an analogy for them being corparate stooges
[4:45:51] Vtal: Idk how they come up with that haha
[4:46:16] Owlcopwn: a new BIGGEST bad guy!
[4:46:32] sunileif: they tried a dbz and failed
[4:46:43] Drathimos: i dont think danuser diverged that much away from the already established internal lore roadmap that metzen had laid out for him in advance

[4:47:26] sunileif: ya but its a much better story if the titans were evil all along
[4:47:37] sunileif: and we've been duped by their ruse
[4:47:49] MedtnerFangirl: I think it is more interesting to link the First Ones to Azeroth and not necessarily treat them as something removed from our planet
[4:48:05] MedtnerFangirl: plane*
[4:48:05] Owlcopwn: no where
[4:48:07] Drathimos: im not sure about first ones, but there were hints for a jailer type figure
[4:48:07] Owlcopwn: just shadowlands
[4:48:14] Drathimos: going back to Wotlk
[4:48:28] Vtal: Ok hear me out, so they (jailer/arbiters) tried to "embody" anima in a material world like the Gods (Titans) do in Azeroth
[4:48:59] Drathimos: there's a quest where arthas fights off wraith type minions. why would ghosts go against arthas if he was the ruler of death?
[4:49:08] Drathimos: by arthas i mean lich king
[4:49:48] Drathimos: the wraith was trying to kill the scourge to send them back to shadowlands while the lich king held them off
[4:49:57] devascienos: arthas reanimated the dead and they dont like it
[4:50:08] Jangoman: sounds like a good time to me
[4:50:14] sunileif: kinda answered youre own question there
[4:50:29] sunileif: they wanted to go  back to their afterlife
[4:50:50] Drathimos: @sunileif who were commanding these wraiths though? we see the same type of wraiths in revendreth/maw
[4:51:02] sunileif: sylv was turned and still had some free will
[4:51:41] Vtal: There must be a shadowlands of shadowlands am I rite
[4:51:42] argalanmg: mes whipping out the occam’s razor logic
[4:51:44] sunileif: and not all the dead in shadowlands go along with what their told
[4:51:50] Owlcopwn: Really love that important lore points are in books and not anywhere in game
[4:52:23] Jangoman: She had no escape
[4:52:29] Drathimos: sylvanas book is really important to figuring out the motives of the jailer
[4:52:42] Drathimos: without the book, his character is hard to understand
[4:53:05] Vtal: @drathimos enlighten us pls
[4:53:17] sunileif: ya she got out
[4:53:56] Drathimos: @Vtal its hard to explain it all in this chat xD
[4:54:04] sunileif: it sounds liek yure looking way to hard into making the jailer a thing O,o
[4:54:14] Owlcopwn: maiev
[4:54:15] Vtal: If Jailer won what would happen?
[4:54:15] Jangoman: turned his ass into an icecube
[4:54:19] Owlcopwn: or however you spell it
[4:54:19] Drathimos: but tldr zovaal is a buddhist and he wants to get rid of the cycle of life & death.
[4:54:33] Vtal: Rewriting reality could be cool
[4:54:59] Drathimos: @Vtal he wanted to "mind control" everything so that he could create the biggest army of all to fight off against the first ones
[4:55:14] sunileif: nah bring back medivh i need another karazhan with a reverse castle in it
[4:55:18] Jangoman: He just didn't want to really do his job and follow the rules
[4:55:19] Drathimos: yes theres no free will because the first ones are the ones that write "fate"
[4:55:35] Drathimos: and thats what zovaal was trying to convey to sylvanas in the novel
[4:55:38] Jangoman: Hell Yeah kara is the only mega dungeon that was good
[4:55:47] Vtal: So we would exchange nothing
[4:55:57] Jangoman: Fuck Doti and Mechagon
[4:56:08] Vtal: He might know theres no fate for us, maybe
[4:56:09] sunileif: @Jangoman cause its a mini castlevania castle

[4:57:52] Vtal: Shadowlands and the Jailer is too much for wow imo its like the ultimate macro universe event
[4:57:58] Jangoman: I think he had a crush of Azeroth and just wanted to free her
[4:58:09] Drathimos: the world soul saga is basically the event of ragnarok. ragnarok is a norse mythological apocalypse that kills even the gods. this means that the titans are going to die hence "the last titan". ragnarok is part of the first ones design as a way to create "change". change is chaos according to the titans and they dont like that since they're beings of order
[4:58:14] Jangoman: He wanted to make some little angry titan babies
[4:58:16] MedtnerFangirl: I am so gay for Xal’atath omg
[4:58:32] MedtnerFangirl: I want to be harbinger…ed?
[4:58:50] Owlcopwn: well the dragons magic isnt titan based anymore
[4:58:52] Vtal: @drathimos oh nicely said
[4:58:56] Drathimos: azeroth is a dragon
[4:58:58] sunileif: a sentient weapon

[4:59:44] CKBandit: i mean the third expansion is called the last titan, they've indicated that they're going to kill them off
[5:00:04] Owlcopwn: @CKBandit not necessarily, the last tian could be the last tian waking up,
[5:00:05] Drathimos: azeroth is the twin serpents/dragons of creation as  depicted by the dual color scheme of azerite
[5:00:07] Vtal: Or the last to be born

[5:00:46] Owlcopwn: it could mean either tbh
[5:00:47] al_capow: azeroth is a fake landscape built by sand by kiljeadin. We never killed him, it was all just a dream and we are dream dust
[5:01:05] Drathimos: azeroth could have a visage though but who knows what that would be
[5:01:13] Drathimos: maybe something similar to taurens?
[5:01:14] MedtnerFangirl: Sargeras is the last titan but he’s too busy making fun of Illidan for crying about Malfurion and Tyrade kissing

[5:03:52] Vtal: @drathimos so maybe jailer would literally have a chance of rewriting fate and possibly saving us mortals from sageras shattering?
[5:03:55] Drathimos: surtr is a fire demon who has a giant sword. he stabs that sword into the planet to bathe the world in flames. guess what  we have stabbed in the planet currently?
[5:04:42] Drathimos: @Vtal jailer wanted to put fate into our own hands because the first ones want to "algalon" us
[5:05:12] Owlcopwn: lmao
[5:05:25] Owlcopwn: go figure, the 2 minutes hes gone it pops
[5:05:28] Drathimos: but i think the jailers story is done for now... shadowland plotlines will pick up again after world soul saga ends
[5:05:48] healhut: every time it pops when he goes afk lol
[5:06:10] Owlcopwn: the mes special
[5:06:20] Vtal: @drathimos ok so you think Jailer could be "good"? Im assuming
[5:06:54] Drathimos: hmm. its hard to say. its more of a perspective thing than a good/bad thing
[5:07:06] Drathimos: @sunileif According to Chris Metzen, Sargeras and his Burning Legion were based on the demon Surtur and his fiery legions from Muspelheim, a villain from Marvel Comics' Thor, specifically Walter Simonson's run on The Mighty Thor.[74] Surtur and his counterpart Surtr from Norse mythology are both depicted as giants of flame wielding an enormous sword, who lead massive armies of demons with the ultimate goal of setting the world or the universe aflame.

[5:08:29] Vtal: @drathimos I understand. The community sees zovaal as a bad guy mostly right?
[5:08:58] Drathimos: @Vtal yes
[5:09:42] Vtal: Ofc they do and maybe he is, the maw was def not good for anybody haha
[5:09:50] Drathimos: so sargeras is trying to do an apocalyptic reset, not to end life but rather to "restart" the cycle. titans have held the reigns for too long so they must pass the torch.
[5:10:25] Drathimos: its like when government become too old/senile/corrupt and wont pass the power to the younger generation so therefore you need a fiery revolution to reset the government
[5:10:37] Mazerrise: Sargeras wuz right
[5:11:19] johnnythunderbunny: i love factor
[5:11:26] johnnythunderbunny: i wish i could use your code to reactivate. i tried
[5:11:44] Vtal: Would be cool imo if they break Azeroth in retail cuz we shall have it forever in classic
[5:12:07] devascienos: jailer watched sargeras fail to stop azeroth "his forseen danger" and saw us be corrupted by azerite to stop the titans and was collecting souls to stop us collecting it
[5:12:14] MedtnerFangirl: there was a Factor box in the lobby today and I admit to having thought of cdew first, lol
[5:12:22] Drathimos: waking azeroth up essentially removes the veils between the realms so this allows the void to usher into azeroth hence the "midnight" expac
[5:13:03] Drathimos: xalatath, azshara, iridikron are all trying to wake her up

[5:15:37] Drathimos: broxigar was the only mortal to even hit sargeras

[5:17:18] al_capow: mes factor eating cam soon??
[5:17:44] Vtal: Btw how come we had 0 about Tyrion on SL
[5:18:49] Vtal: Tirion*
[5:19:09] Drathimos: i think tirions soul was obliterated from the fel so there was no soul to go to shadowlands
[5:19:22] Drathimos: fel consumes the soul
[5:20:07] Devcomz: They disrespected Tirion ngl I loved Legion but that part of the story was really bad
[5:20:07] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[5:20:11] Devcomz: Not a fan of it
[5:20:16] chipncheese: killed by a mid tier boss
[5:20:19] chipncheese: DansGame
[5:20:22] Drathimos: LUL
[5:20:31] Drathimos: legion felt like they killed so many people randomly
[5:20:35] chipncheese: ya but varian's death
[5:20:37] chipncheese: was fucking epic
[5:20:40] Drathimos: varian, tirion, voljin
[5:20:43] chipncheese: its probably one of the vbest cineamtics in theg ame
[5:21:09] chipncheese: voljin got butchered
[5:21:14] chipncheese: to my warlocks pet
[5:21:22] CKBandit: they killed off voljin because he was boring. i dont even think the evil sylvanas plot was planned yet. seemed like it was supposed to be her redemption
[5:21:24] Vtal: They killed too many wtf
[5:21:28] Drathimos: yeah but it did feel a bit "forced"
[5:21:29] Devcomz: Varian went down fighting though out of all of the deaths in the beginning I feel they kind of (big Kind of) did his at least right and respectfully he went down fighting
[5:21:58] chipncheese: i mean they got flanked when sthe horde had to fall back
[5:21:58] Devcomz: Voljin was they most disrespected though
[5:22:03] Devcomz: with Tirion
[5:22:08] Vtal: They should retcon Those deaths
[5:22:10] chipncheese: varian sacrifieced himself to save the bulk of the alliance leadership
[5:22:29] Drathimos: voljin is coming back anyways
[5:22:43] Drathimos: he became a loa in shadowlands
[5:22:46] Drathimos: so he is rebirthing
[5:23:21] CKBandit: i think the most glaring cut for time is nathanos. surely he was supposed to show up in shadowlands
[5:23:39] Vtal: Tirion should comeback and descend in Azeroth like Tyrael or Gandalf
[5:23:41] Drathimos: he merged with rezen as he was dying
[5:24:42] CKBandit: i actually liked nathanos, few characters left with personality
[5:25:03] chipncheese: fel destroys the soul
[5:25:18] Drathimos: they're dead dead i think
[5:25:27] chipncheese: there was nothing left, they both were obliterated by the fel
[5:25:50] Vtal: There must be a way
[5:26:21] chipncheese: they need to kill of malfurion, he's just naturally too strong of a character
[5:26:41] chipncheese: b/c they nerf him
[5:26:54] chipncheese: so like in the war of the ancients
[5:27:00] devascienos: watched his mrs become girl boss
[5:27:10] chipncheese: he literally goes toe to toe and ends up turning ht tide VS whats his face

[5:27:24] chipncheese: b/c he's too strong
[5:27:24] Vtal: I didnt play after wotlk into SL, what Tirion do after wotlk?
[5:27:24] vaighnthemage: Who malf?
[5:27:39] chipncheese: he is stornger then whats his face
[5:27:42] vaighnthemage: He's a sleepy dude
[5:27:57] CKBandit: they made a big show of bringing back ysera, saying we needed her, but i dont remember her even doing anything
[5:27:58] chipncheese: he's as strong or stronger
[5:28:05] chipncheese: then archimonde
[5:28:13] nerfurface: @chipncheese cenarius?
[5:28:21] chipncheese: malfurion
[5:28:25] vaighnthemage: He's stronger than illidan!
[5:28:45] chipncheese: during war of the ancients, he goes toe to toe with archimonde, and archimonde has to fall back because malfuion was starting to win
[5:28:50] chipncheese: after tyrande gets kidnapped
[5:29:02] chipncheese: and he ewas SUEPR young
[5:29:02] Vtal: Cenarius is Biden
[5:29:06] chipncheese: still a student back then
[5:29:22] chipncheese: now 10,000 years later, he's literally a demigod

[5:29:48] chipncheese: and they have to keep making lame excuses on why he's sidelined
[5:30:36] chipncheese: like in BFA, he could have destroyed nathanos army on his own, they jsut have to weaken him for plot reasons
[5:30:37] Vtal: Bro I havent seen you play since I joined lmao
[5:30:40] vaighnthemage: He's like having Tom Brady on the bench
[5:30:41] chipncheese: in the darkshore battle
[5:30:58] vaighnthemage: True
[5:31:17] chipncheese: i mean he still has those big wins regardless, its just dumb to bench him
[5:32:05] chipncheese: its like having tom brady after he had 4 superbowl wins already
[5:32:09] chipncheese: and benching him
[5:32:19] Vtal: So currently theres no lich king anymore
[5:32:33] chipncheese: he's still 4x superbowl champion, still can contribute big time, they are just benching him for no reason
[5:33:13] Vtal: But we want one
[5:33:15] vaighnthemage: Goat
[5:33:20] Vtal: Dont we
[5:33:36] vaighnthemage: I think mes should be the lich king
