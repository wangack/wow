[4:46:22] fat_european0: Thundering would've been fine if it didn't buff mobs by 5% HP. It didn't even feel like a buff even if you min/maxed it
[4:46:23] rpgonlyforme: it was better

[4:48:08] Whitewolf1441: 14 hours???????
[4:48:10] fat_european0: They should just make encrypted a permanent seasonal. You could put it in any dungeon and it would automatically be 5x better
