[1:10:55] ParzivalsTv: @PurgeFIN i know same here :D

[1:14:51] dee_lish: @hateab that is as bad as it gets, because your body keeps a ledger of nights it doesnt get REM sleep. If you dont stop doing this, one day your body will take REM sleep ( dream sleep ) while you are awake.
[1:14:53] warbringer159: difference between good FC and good at using all the jump exploits kek

[1:44:52] mob_figgaz213: tbc is lame
[1:44:53] Eunit: I actually quit before all the blizz drama, I got scared they were gonna introduce the WoW token and ruin any grinding I did, straight up
[1:44:56] lain_jpeg: HES STILL GRINDING IT LETS GO
[1:45:08] 1herjar: I'm on firemaw EU and the server is bumping
[1:45:08] dozed: who doesnt get bored in bc raiding lul
[1:45:27] PooperTrooper90s: lbh no one quit/cared about the blizzard drama. they quit due to boredom
[1:45:45] Englesyn: i think the blizzard thing that happend this summer was just a final straw for alot. a big thing was lack of content in retail i think
[1:45:51] Eunit: i wasnt bored, the data mining token scared me lol
[1:45:52] H0tangel99: no way many people definitely quit because of the drama
[1:45:58] bringthecocowow: hey swifty ive been a fan for many years and ive been searching for a song in one of your videos for years now, its warrior vs ret paladin from cata (yoggy) all i know is that the song is from ephixia please could i get the name ;D
[1:46:01] centinex420: for me its I find the game harder to enjoy without the old friends I used to play with
[1:46:07] Smugglyx: If you enjoy PvP then the game never really gets boring. But if you only PvE then its only a matter of time
[1:46:16] Xablanque: FFXIV is n my sling a killing right now and New world was released
[1:46:16] xplicit_tm: agree 100% @PooperTrooper90s
[1:46:23] Eunit: I also didnt want to give 15 a month to that company for reasons well beyond the scandal
[1:46:37] Englesyn: yeah FFXIV helped
[1:46:50] 1herjar: there's tons of stuff to do in bc outside of raiding and pvp, people just like saying the game is dead for the drama of it.. some are saying the same about SOM
[1:47:00] Englesyn: currently playing it lol as i watch
[1:47:00] bringthecocowow: hey swifty ive been a fan for many years and ive been searching for a song in one of your videos for years now, its warrior vs ret paladin from cata (yoggy) all i know is that the song is from ephixia please could i get the name ;D
[1:47:03] H0tangel99: yeah i think the drama was just a catalyst
[1:47:13] Eunit: new world is honestly, awful
[1:47:16] HalloweenMoonCrab: Chat what‚Äôs been your favorite movie/tv you‚Äôve seen this year? Needing some recs
[1:47:30] SpikeMisery: Blizzard just doesn't seem to care about its user base anymore.
[1:47:58] Smugglyx: Well, I must admit. We don't get enough for a Sub Game
[1:47:59] Eunit: @SpikeMisery  nope, retail is so laughably easy...the PC stuff turned me off too like /spit etc
[1:47:59] GiyumTell: there is no blizzard anyymore so
[1:48:01] Englesyn: it uses the Guild War s modle
[1:48:08] 1herjar: @spikemisery preach brother
[1:48:17] slanza613: need some windfury on weapon
[1:48:21] Fressk: its pretty much activision not blizzzard
[1:48:34] centinex420: they don't care about the user base because their store mounts and pets make them a killing for way way less time invested
[1:48:39] Rel2021: GW2 came out in 2012
[1:48:40] Fressk: the same activision that screwed over the Modwern warfare developers
[1:48:43] Rel2021: GW been out a loong time tho
[1:48:43] Eunit: are BGs in classic all connected?
[1:48:51] Englesyn: yeaahh
[1:48:52] BringerPC: hi swifty

[1:49:29] GiyumTell: lets see what dreamhaven will bring us :D
[1:49:34] Eunit: like all cross realm? or are their still battle groups??
[1:49:34] ask_peter: It's easy to find people who criticize, but I think retail also offers a lot of good. It will never be so that everyone is satisfied, but if I compare Shadowlands with the two expansions before, then a lot of grinding has fallen away, alts can be brought super fast to a good niveau and a lot of things that are good about WoW like to remain unmentioned.
[1:49:40] Xablanque: Blizzard trying to tap into nostalgia and it obviously wasn‚Äôt the right move
[1:50:00] BringerPC: What are you gonna do after reaching rank 1?
[1:50:06] Eunit: idk man they sold a lottttt
[1:50:09] Rygaros: @Rel2021 1 year after wow came out
[1:50:12] CloakVisionBulgaria: do u still play ur warrior swifty
[1:50:27] Smugglyx: I do think its a good move because if they are paying attention there was a lot they could learn from it
[1:50:27] Eunit: wow classic was huge for Blizzard
[1:50:29] 1herjar: @xablanque you think you do but you don't LUL
[1:51:25] SpikeMisery: Classic was one of the few things they've done right.
[1:51:32] Eunit: swifty is sooo casually good at WoW BGs reading all of these and owning people at the same time lmao
[1:51:43] 1herjar: do you guys think wotlk will be as big as classic ?
[1:51:51] Eunit: you may have too many hours at this point dude
[1:51:51] thirstyaxis: there is nothing to do in retail lol if you don't want to do arenas or mythic +, that's all there is
[1:51:59] Fatpiggg: Most ppl i knew who played wow back in the day got jumped back into classic‚Ä¶. Only for a month or two though lol

[5:19:29] fara_owo: we didnt mean to q into u
[5:19:42] tamilveeran: why the heck are they tryin to Tea bag???
[5:20:07] Rbglol: so you farm a level 10 on level 1s at a graveyard

[5:20:21] pwnstarqt: lol
[5:20:33] lukipoos: 10 guys need to grp vs other random solo players cos they just bad
[5:20:50] Englesyn: hes a Marshal already?
[5:20:57] tamilveeran: Just 10 more days to rank 14 swifty
[5:21:00] cloudb0ys: they don't pick who they go against @lukipoos
[5:21:21] pwnstarqt: no models this evening @swifty

[5:21:33] pwnstarqt: modelo*
[5:21:36] igneous1091: You can solo que to r14 in SOM?
[5:21:38] psfadingtoblack: I think stream sniping is funny to a certain point. like killing a streamer once or twice in a bg/world pvp is fine but just repeatedly doing it over and over again is just childish
[5:21:41] lukipoos: they need to gro as 10 vs any1. cos they cant win without the grp
[5:22:11] tamilveeran: @lukipoos  and you point is??
[5:22:12] fara_owo: ofc you can its all time in classic
[5:22:21] fara_owo: just play more than the others

[5:22:40] igneous1091: I remember in original launch there were organized groups, and they cycled people though. If you solo que'd you wouldnt get enough RP in the week to break past like r12
[5:22:41] lukipoos: reading comprehensions skills m8
[5:22:44] pwnstarqt: You ever play a Sicilian defense as black @Swifty
[5:23:05] tamilveeran: @lukipoos you seem dumb , if that makes it easy to win, why wouldnt you do that
[5:23:29] tamilveeran: @lukipoos  seems like gaming is hard for you to comprehend
[5:23:44] pwnstarqt: Bobby Fischer made it famous playing it against a Queen's Gambit opening
[5:23:46] lukipoos: of course it makes it easier to read. hence why i said they do it
[5:24:13] lukipoos: ive seen this like 3 times and u still ask me what i mean

[5:25:51] H0tangel99: swifty your grinding is very inspiring
[5:25:54] Dinglebop_lol: DONT CASPER FARM I BELIEVE IN YOU
[5:27:12] pwnstarqt: @lukipoos agreed almost as bad as  multi boxing
[5:27:14] Muntrasjonsraaden: @lukipoos They don't group as 10 vs solo players. They have no control over who they are matched up against. They are just following the meta and doing premades like most other players. Most games they are matched against other premades.
[5:27:36] Sathfire: learn to read yikes @lukipoos
[5:27:58] H0tangel99: lmao
[5:28:05] Sathfire: lol nice
[5:28:22] sothis666: the irony
[5:28:24] pwnstarqt: I thought you were talking about open world grouping I retract
[5:28:26] megachubbzz: @lukipoos only way to prove your right is to go get rank 14
[5:28:30] lukipoos: they deliberately queue as 10 knowing full well most games will be against solo queue players and yet u say they don't do it on purpose
[5:28:54] lukipoos: and this sath dude know idea what ur on about. i havent been rude to any1 . chill

It's not like you're playing a class where knowing your position is going to sway the result like a druid with the flag etc. If anything the stream snipers tunnel visioning you would put the their team at a disadvantage... unless you know that was the correct play regardless and you're not actually being stream sniped..
[8:16:01] Gizimoo86: only works in tbc

[8:17:53] Gizimoo86: Yeah it makes harder to see hp need to swap targets more from distance
[8:17:58] Giller91_: wait was it really 60y in vanilla? why did they do 20y in classic then
[8:18:04] k1rux_: true, console command dont even work so addon cant
[8:18:21] Aysentaro: its coz of phase 2
[8:18:30] smiith_tv: it was 30 yard at classic era
[8:18:30] Aysentaro: when in world pvp everyone was using that spy tool
[8:18:34] Aysentaro: so they changed it
[8:18:38] Neonbonkers: @bralf doesnt work
[8:19:04] Gizimoo86: For clutter and you could see flag carrier nameplate trough walls
[8:19:05] au_chilli: Is this just for lvl 60 swifty, because on my lvl 25, I can see them across the map
[8:19:17] smiith_tv: I wanted to change it to 40 because I was a hunter but I couldn't
[8:19:21] bax_88: That doesnt make sense all  casters stay 30 yards in raids, 36 yards with talents lol

[8:20:23] rookie286: blizz locked nameplates at 20 yds on purpose, nothing can change that

[8:20:57] zod_32: @swifty move unit frames more to the center?
[8:21:11] Gizimoo86: i keep my target frame low middle of the screen close to my skill bar
[8:21:19] zod_32: view distance changes nothing for enemy players FYI
[8:21:26] The_Captain_UK: @Swifty Move your target frames to be more central on your screen? :D
[8:21:28] ohyeahboyy: Get a drone
[8:21:29] zod_32: its just to see terrain n shiz

[8:22:32] Gizimoo86: HC will loose players when people start to die in raids
[8:22:35] The_Captain_UK: YES! ;)
[8:22:37] Aruze2014: what is classic HC?
[8:22:40] back2r00ts: HC never dies LUL
[8:22:45] Malkir1: @Swifty I was your flag carrier this game :D wadup :P
[8:22:55] toto_bamze: are u still playing shadowlands? and why
[8:22:58] demproblems: @axen10 that's what people say about everything, lol
[8:22:58] Carapuce1234: which spec 31./0/20 or 30/0/21 ? :)
[8:23:02] The_Captain_UK: It's not dying, Jokerd had 14k viewers yesterday for MC raid! :D
[8:23:27] zakare232: hardcore
[8:23:35] TenThousandJawsWillDrop: heroic NotLikeThis
[8:23:35] The_Captain_UK: @Swifty ARE YOU UP TO THE CHALLENGE?? :D
[8:23:38] Shattermare: Hardcore
[8:23:42] Giller91_: but it's only cause ppl wanna see them die on their HC chars, once that happens nobody is gonna watch that
[8:23:51] Giller91_: it's a fad
[8:23:52] The_Captain_UK: That's what they're shooting for! ;)
[8:23:59] au_chilli: Maybe check - Interface options, then names, then select always show nameplates, maybe you have it to show only in combat
[8:24:02] back2r00ts: cause they always slow these days
[8:24:09] demproblems: It doesn't make any sense for them NOT TO make a hardcore server
[8:24:12] PatchesMcPatch: If anything is popular enough blizzard will do it.  Remember how much animosity and vitriol towards world buffs?  they changed those
[8:24:13] The_Captain_UK: The HC community are pushing for Hardcore servers in the future :)
[8:24:15] Aruze2014: no
[8:24:16] dead_floppy: a hardcore RP server would make sense to me
[8:24:16] AwesomeTwitchDude: Swifty do you have time for a bicep flex
[8:24:18] Pfuffiii: @pfuffiqt is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[8:24:19] golderiiii: yes

[8:24:26] Noonyoo: yes 100%
[8:24:27] FlreFrostY: nope
[8:24:28] headhunter451: they would have to make it PvP not PVE
[8:24:29] flaskeman_: yes!!
[8:24:30] The_Captain_UK: The PRESTIGE!!! :D
[8:24:31] Scans_: cope
[8:24:33] Aysentaro: with the griefing going around it wouldnt work
[8:24:34] M0kkori: on that server.. will be only rogues
[8:24:35] TimmyGamingCZ: 24h stream or what countdoun?
[8:24:36] babblarn86: i play it right now and ive died 13 times
[8:24:37] lukipoos: i think ppl will
[8:24:37] Gizimoo86: No ranking pvp in is hc enough for me LuL
[8:24:38] zakare232: like diablo
[8:24:39] Nathramas: no
[8:24:41] back2r00ts: its so much adrenalin LUL
[8:24:42] Aysentaro: what if someone drops an infernal on me
[8:24:42] demproblems: I think a lot of people would play it
[8:24:43] lukipoos: hardcore is fun
[8:24:45] rgpozzo: as a yeet obviously
[8:24:50] m0nsqe: 1 would try once and stop after dying
[8:24:50] unbrokenzi: it would be cool for a change
[8:24:51] The_Captain_UK: It would make all the content SOOO EXCITING
[8:24:53] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[8:24:56] demproblems: It makes the game more enjoyable
[8:24:56] Noonyoo: pvp server like that would be crazy
[8:24:57] au_chilli: @swifty Maybe check - Interface options, then names, then select always show nameplates, maybe you have it to show only in combat
[8:24:58] DiplomaticoBipolar: but if u die in open world or in dungeons aswell?
[8:25:02] zakare232: and PVP is off course
[8:25:06] Gizimoo86: one disconnect or bug and you loose character
[8:25:06] k1m1Live: watching someone play HC and playing it yourself are completely different. 0% chance I would play that myself.
[8:25:09] The_Captain_UK: Imagine Streams & Raids where people are DELETED when they DIE!!
[8:25:09] smiith_tv: the only way to survive is to group questing from level 1 xD
[8:25:13] Fabified_: if it had 300% xp yes :D
[8:25:13] refusetosleep: swifty, will you still play wow in 20 years?
[8:25:16] luperdi_89: what's your spec? you are mainly using a shield?
[8:25:19] DiplomaticoBipolar: does pvp counts on your perma death?
[8:25:21] dudatron: the HC server would be empty I think in a bout a month :D
[8:25:23] demproblems: Imagine EXTREME Hardcore, if you die in BG you get your char deleted
[8:25:23] ohyeahboyy: Or maybe if you had like 3 lives would be cool
[8:25:24] Neonbonkers: pvp or pve lol @Swifty
[8:25:31] The_Captain_UK: Hardcore WSG would be HILAAARIOUS! xD
[8:25:51] M0kkori: rogues and people playing in group... hardcore will just mean the most "cancer" people, killing greys to avoid future high lvl
[8:25:52] zakare232: LUL GG
