[0:12:31] Gizimoo86: basically you want aim for bracket 12 to get R12
[0:13:15] robert_sigi: In Vanilla the toughest thing was (aswell) to keep your Rank 13/14; you had to play 15-18hrs a day for two wee\ks to keep it ...
[0:13:31] Flakkattack: I'm hoping to go from rank 7 to 10, but I have no idea if 400-500k will be enough for that

[0:17:55] saints17137: since your getting rank 14 on shaman will this open you up to playing other classes and doing rank 14
[0:18:04] Dirtysecret1O1: is it right that warriors dont have a "setup" to burst a player down in pvp, like a druid has to setup his cd's and then burst down during a stun
[0:18:07] TheRabbitWizard: zfgHey
[0:18:12] silent_storm_45: i dont believe it :D

[1:03:20] Gizimoo86: twitch makes huge diffence in game population, example Tarkov did some streams + loot drops and there is currently 60k server queue to even play the game
[1:03:56] VanishSHRoguE: so I did some researching and from the looks of it in p1, you can hit up to 400 more spell power total, but theres a hybrid build where you'll hit potentially 300 but have 10% more spell crit alone :D

[1:05:38] VanishSHRoguE: no, just abdicating of pieces will flat out spell power, but you're getting crit with them and less spell power. ALot of the gear though needs int as well though. But you do have PVP SET as well

[1:41:25] exequtegg: there's no double decay....
[1:41:25] danzos: if people stack  by brackets everyone gets the same % of progress
[1:41:27] exequtegg: its the opposite
[1:42:00] excorp: been waiting for classic+, but idk if it'll ever come
[1:42:06] kankerbad1337: will you play LOST ARK ?

[1:42:27] hennyMG: I have only ever played retail but you make me want to play classic looks way more fun
[1:42:33] exequtegg: decay is 10% now instead of 20% as it used to be, which is why the rank grind is cuti n half.. who ever said double decay is compeltely wrong
[1:42:39] SonicAtomic: @Swifty have you seen Elden Ring ?
[1:42:42] AltairWoW: rhub: that's what im playing right now, will quit when wotlk classic comes out tho
[1:42:44] Chosey: @rbubbaray thx

[1:44:09] thelegend7: if he cant outfarm him he doesn't deserve it üï∂Ô∏è
[1:44:13] CBAUnite: @Swifty the irony is the dude is r12 right now and has been given a br1 spot but out of spite refusing to stack
[1:44:28] AltairWoW: i can see both sides of that argument, why should one guy change how he plays to help some guy he doesnt know?
[1:44:54] koolkanake3: 1m honor a week yikes

[2:01:25] zanthixx: get yourself a tidal charm
[2:01:33] rbubbaray: stomp is a stun ?
[2:01:50] Gizimoo86: you can trinket out of war stomp if fast
[2:02:03] nightst314: @Swifty afaik warstomp cast can be interupted and that locks out all your nature spells too
[2:02:08] koolkanake3: use goblin mortar its even better than tidal charm
[2:02:11] Aviator777: what shield do you have?
[2:02:14] RastislavConka: why would you even play classic
[2:02:17] 3lfidan: Tidal is reeeeeally good to have if you can get it for sure
[2:02:23] RastislavConka: when TBC is out
[2:02:44] koolkanake3: goblin mortar does 800 damage on a crit and stuns aoe for 3 sec and is instant cast in classic

[2:04:02] koolkanake3: you would be better off with shorter grounding totem cd talent instead of 15 % str and grace of air totem
[2:04:07] hoyber566: Not sure in classic
[2:04:09] 3lfidan: You only need to drop WF on engage to get them started and again if you get a chance mid fight
[2:04:19] EpicscoreEu: better of going two hand enchance then

[2:16:44] kryppwax: he have 2 weeks
[2:16:44] IdolizeAU: Swifty you really need to go up a bracket. In your current bracket you can't rank past 11
[2:16:49] kryppwax: he got covid remember
[2:16:50] koolkanake3: ts worse
[2:16:52] MRuTV: level 5 rank 14
[2:16:53] koolkanake3: its *
[2:16:54] boltyboytv: im ranking in av now as i level to save weeks
[2:16:59] Sowiloo: maybe it's easy to win as solo, there aren't premades at bracket 59
[2:17:01] back2r00ts: no premades LUL
[2:17:03] imvecks: whats the general ppol size of your server?
[2:17:07] YoungVisionNate: You rank slower at lower lvls I thought
[2:17:08] koolkanake3: if you are lower lv you get less honor per kill and bg
[2:17:10] pumperinos: just lower brackets
[2:17:10] MRuTV: im trolling brah
[2:17:12] botl0gic: mc run after rank 14??

[2:18:12] ryanjtilda: swift doing a subathon? Going to sleep on stream? lol
[2:18:15] Chosey: yeah pvp at launch kind of ruined the raiding scene
[2:18:17] avenomxx: @maruniis you can probably be around standing 50-100 to hit rank 11
[2:18:20] lurifax_exe: @Swifty Are you resto???
[2:18:31] VanishSHRoguE: pvp gear won't make you god mode you're having 5-8 pieces of value just saying :P so you'll want to pve as well for full optimal build
[2:18:32] Gizimoo86: Its possible people get bored after R11-R14 and servers start loosing players, no point of even raiding next phases?
[2:18:34] curi322: ele
[2:18:44] maruniis: @avenomxx alright thank you :)
[2:19:16] sonartwitchtv: No, alot of people are doing too much pvp and not helping
[2:19:24] sonartwitchtv: whoa
[2:19:24] GoGetItKo: 60% :(
[2:19:26] Chosey: other guilds have cleared it though lol
[2:19:26] Justiino: no one wants to farm MC like it's AQ. They should've made no changes
[2:19:29] boltyboytv: i agree
[2:19:34] Knullzey: Payo did it today lol
[2:19:35] koolkanake3: its also not worth  because gear is bad
[2:19:38] Gizimoo86: Raids arent for casuals i think
[2:19:42] robertw288: is it working back into world of Warcraft ?
[2:19:58] LukeyBTV: imagine having to put in effort
[2:19:58] Chosey: the gear isnt bad?
[2:20:02] LukeyBTV: and not just getting free loot

[2:20:27] koolkanake3: you will not win roll for those items
[2:20:29] VanishSHRoguE: @Swifty alot of classes running pvp for weapon + sets but offpieces will be raid guaranteed
[2:20:31] koolkanake3: @Xuez

[2:23:17] 21scourge: Imagine a car renting service ( an app for your phone) where you buy NFT that makes it possible for you to unlock the closest car to you

[2:23:59] koolkanake3: how much is pepe the frog NFT ?
[2:24:02] Gizimoo86: nftconneeeeect!!!
[2:24:02] Theleafyo: Just set up couple shell companies, trade NFT between them for a bump each time and some sucker think its going up for real and buys it out.
[2:24:10] boltyboytv: buying an NFT and then screen shotting it to use as your profile picture LUL
[2:24:27] 5antino: @knullzey people have sold art for centuries to money launder. the blockchain is what makes it unique to be able to secure your piece of data

[2:26:11] koolkanake3: @Chosey with your advice it would be 0
[2:26:11] collin_bo_ballin: @nemTulRavasz exactly. and NFT also show proof of ownership, proof of authentication, and prevent theft
[2:26:31] Chosey: @koolkanake3 look up the % of people that have gotten scammed, its A LOT

[2:27:12] Dissuxx: That's not how you should get into crypto. I just have an automatic crypto buy every week.

[2:27:41] 5antino: yeah diversifying the portfolio is best, some NYSE and some crypto and some houses
[2:27:51] ironforge_1337: ya gotta choose between 1) day trading 2) swing trading 3) longterm investing
[2:27:54] Chosey: @bigd2017 you sound like the bots I see on every crypto vid
[2:27:55] justice_bw: Vanguard retirement fund chads report in
[2:27:55] Gizimoo86: you can do bank transfer?
[2:27:56] boltyboytv: just by bitcoin and wait 10 years and youll be rich
[2:27:56] deftlyx: Gotta link your checking account
[2:27:57] vycvyper92: Dollar Cost Averaging
[2:28:16] ironforge_1337: @Justice_sc reporting
[2:28:23] Dissuxx: Don't use robinhood. For crypto you just use coinbase as a newbie
[2:28:23] Chosey: a lot of people get scammed
[2:28:26] ironforge_1337: @Swifty what service are you talking about?
[2:28:27] avenomxx: robin hood was the worst app to use
[2:28:33] koolkanake3: @boltyboytv until it fails randomly one day
[2:28:36] bigd2017: They use Plaid to do that I think. They don't have access. They only use it to see your balance
[2:28:39] ironforge_1337: i use Kraken dot com
[2:28:40] ephin_the_mage: ask the guys outside the bank while in orgrimmar tho
[2:28:42] gentaro_: linking is one thing but giving the username and password is something else, i wouldn't do it either
[2:28:43] fullmetal_gamer_: yeah don't use robinhood at all
[2:28:44] jasonbriggs: i do that have a second acc for my direct debits
[2:28:47] 6Foot3Inches: Have you ever had a dream that that you um you had you'd you would you could you'd do you wi you wants you you could do so you you'd do you could you you want you want him to do you so much you could do anything?
[2:28:49] FADEDGruzhyy: @collintaylor2295 issues are not with NFT itself, it's with exchanges where they are traded.. a lot of stolen work being solde is the issue
[2:28:49] EccoTwitch: I use Robinhood
[2:28:50] nick1ups: they cant transfer money out of your account
[2:28:53] GodKingMuninn: @collintaylor2295 And with an NFT you don't actually own the said image, nor do you own the copyright; you have acess to it but you still cannot utilize it as you want. Its the same principle as those websites that let you name a star... Hint: You buy nothing and just wasted money

[2:28:59] bigd2017: No. Coinbase Pro.  Much cheaper fees
[2:29:02] it_is_what_lt_is: i thought we quit robinhood after gme drama
[2:29:04] nick1ups: i use robinhood
[2:29:04] 5antino: @Swifty Coinbase Pro is better and less transaction fee
[2:29:09] nick1ups: no problems
[2:29:11] gaypen97: Do NOT use robinhood, its a sketchy company. For crypto you should use binance. Robinhood sells your buy/sell orders to marketmakers ( big hedge funds ) and they also freeze ppls funds @Swifty
[2:29:19] tizzonmyjits: <3'
[2:29:31] Gizimoo86: Binance is pretty good
[2:29:33] nawnawnaw: ez dodge
[2:29:38] avenomxx: Coinbase Pro or Binance is good to use
[2:29:45] ironforge_1337: robinhood halted trading because regular people were making money and rich people were losing money
[2:29:54] FADEDGruzhyy: binance doesn't have the best reputation as well, have read some stories on reddit about them withholding your funds
[2:29:55] gaypen97: they removed the buy button for gamestop
[2:29:57] jjcthedroid: gamestop
[2:30:01] iks89_: LuvPeekL
[2:30:07] Osculatus: gamestop
[2:30:18] fullmetal_gamer_: it wasn't a bug
[2:30:21] jjcthedroid: it wasnt a bug
[2:30:21] Chosey: shady
[2:30:21] JudasPwntJesus: yea binaries is safe, they just got hacked for 300 mil.....
[2:30:22] HatredTakesOn: They froze it
[2:30:23] Justiino: they refused to allow people to sell GME Stock
[2:30:25] ironforge_1337: it wasn't a bug.... it was deliverate ;)
[2:30:27] Osculatus: a "bug"
[2:30:27] Justiino: because they couldn't meet demand
[2:30:29] fullmetal_gamer_: they purposely did it
[2:30:31] Prayforheals: Yeah not a bug lol
[2:30:32] k1m1Live: it was intentional, not a bug
[2:30:33] MAPEone: Active choice - not a bug
[2:30:34] ccnn24: wasn't a bug

[2:30:36] StreamElements: carrytoonz just subscribed for 5 months in a row PogChamp
[2:30:37] elsuave08: lol
[2:30:37] gaypen97: it was not a bug, they saved hegde funds ( and themselves ) from getting liquidated @Swifty

[2:30:42] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:30:42] DrazonTV: not a bug
[2:30:42] collin_bo_ballin: no it was gamestop. robinhooh made it to where you couldnt buy it because of how much people were buying gamestop
[2:30:44] ironforge_1337: don't be naive and gullible lol
[2:30:44] ccnn24: was intended
[2:30:46] Dissuxx: Binance isn't so good in the US I've heard. Coinbase is just newbie friendly. I buy 50 euros of bitcoin automatically every week. Don't have to do anything.
[2:30:48] Gizimoo86: bug greyScam
[2:30:50] it_is_what_lt_is: they made it so you could only buy 1-5 shares, you could always sell it
[2:30:51] gaypen97: "bug" Kappa
[2:30:51] Gizadragon: SURE a bug
[2:30:52] DrazonTV: the market was frozen because they crashed it
[2:30:54] Chosey: let the gullible keep getting scammed
[2:31:04] bigd2017: Swifty. You could make some money creating your own NFT

[2:31:37] Gizimoo86: omg not blizzard
[2:31:37] FADEDGruzhyy: a lot of people are jumping on NFT
[2:31:47] collin_bo_ballin: @fullmetal_gamer_ swifty and peanut are gods!
[2:31:53] ironforge_1337: keep investing simple: roth ira and/or 401k + buy and own your own home
[2:31:56] Sowiloo: every company is like that
[2:31:59] Sowiloo: riot games too
[2:32:09] Chosey: "a lot of people"
[2:32:09] JudasPwntJesus: eminem just spent millions on a nft
[2:32:24] gaypen97: @Dissuxx coinbase is just as sketch as robinhood, they also removed the buy button for LRC ( loopring ) because they "ran out" of crypto aka they never had it and had to set market huge market orders. Also takes them several days to move your funds sometimes... No idea how binance is for americans but for EU its rly good.
[2:32:31] collin_bo_ballin: @JudasPwntJesus nah just $400,000
[2:32:44] ironforge_1337: passive, simple, low risk investments = sleep very well at night and make money off compound interest over decades
[2:32:48] bigd2017: Don't miss out on the opportunity of your lifetime. Crypto. NFT's. DeFi. You will kick yourself later
[2:32:54] collin_bo_ballin: Swifty have you ever bought a skin in a game?
[2:32:58] hochelagaa: dont feed blizz ideas
[2:33:02] exomaths: Dont give them ideas lol
[2:33:04] FADEDGruzhyy: there are virtual worlds actually that have been sold for a lot of money
[2:33:05] nightst314: own all capital cities and kick out the trade chat spammers @Swifty
[2:33:08] collin_bo_ballin: omg swifty that is the metaverse! that is decentraland!
[2:33:08] avenomxx: @gaypen97 yeah they messed up on shibu listing, 1 zero too much
[2:33:08] 5antino: you wouldn't own it.. it's like land.. the landlord it says it's their but the government actually owns it
[2:33:08] Dissuxx: @gaypen97 Sure, but it's great for DCAing. For trading I use binance (I live in the EU so I get access to all the altcoins)
[2:33:09] 21scourge: i mean metaverse is coming, virtual real estate
[2:33:18] bigd2017: Some games are already doing that. Buying property. Owning things in game to do what u want with
[2:33:19] collin_bo_ballin: that is basically an NFT!
[2:33:21] botl0gic: You should just buy blizzard activision Pog
[2:33:23] DrazonTV: yeah thats called housing which quite normal in mmorpgs these days, only wow doesnt have it
[2:33:26] Osculatus: a million dollars Kappa
[2:33:28] Chosey: @Wakitibudota and who does the benefit?
[2:33:34] Chosey: that*
[2:33:35] Gizimoo86: yeah i keep most of the crypto on hardware wallet (usb stick)
[2:33:36] Fatal3295: I would totally buy the bar in goldshire on Moonglade
[2:33:36] gaypen97: @Dissuxx that makes sense then. I see what you mean :)
[2:33:44] Dumpsterr: isn't NFT that everybody can own the same house you just own a digital deed claiming you have the house but there's infinite digital deeds
[2:33:46] exomaths: We will all do duels outside swiftys house
[2:33:49] ephin_the_mage: like lineage2
[2:33:51] ironforge_1337: @Fatal3295 lmao
[2:33:53] nick1ups: thats what NFTs are for so you can own unique digital things
[2:33:56] collin_bo_ballin: Swifty you literally just decribed an NFT.
[2:34:03] FADEDGruzhyy: @Fatal3295 imagine all the rent you could bring in :D
[2:34:06] Dissuxx: @gaypen97 I just have an automated buy every week for 50 euros :)
[2:34:14] ephin_the_mage: clan halls yes
[2:34:17] Chosey: "guys I own virtual land but still live in my mother's basement"
[2:34:23] 5antino: it would be traded through blockchain to make it secure
[2:34:26] nightst314: @Swifty buy the ashbringer NFT
[2:34:30] leosabh: second life work like that
[2:34:31] collin_bo_ballin: many NFT are going to parts of games. not just pieces of artwork
[2:34:38] truvidienn: Aren;t NFT's like "play to earn"?
[2:34:39] gaypen97: I hope gaming NFTs get big but at the moment all the NFT games arent even close to AAA games we play today, concept is cool but its not there yet gameplay wise.
[2:34:45] fullmetal_gamer_: Well you wouldn't own it cause it'll still belong to the IP which belongs to the company
[2:34:46] FADEDGruzhyy: there will be a game on Cardano blockchain where you build your tavern and it actually has an value if im not mistaken?
[2:34:49] SonicAtomic: NFTs should be illegal - they're not legit at all
[2:34:52] Dissuxx: NFTs can make you a lot of money, but it's also scammer friendly
[2:35:01] etainebless: having an npc in the game like some streamers would be a dope nft @Swifty
[2:35:06] ironforge_1337: sometimes boomers are simply behind the times but i think they're right about NFT's.....  i just don't think they're good investments at all
[2:35:12] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:35:27] Venom77: that's what Ultima online was
[2:35:31] collin_bo_ballin: @SonicAtomic they are as legit as skins you buy in a video game. they are the same concept
[2:35:42] gaypen97: @ironforge_1337 the tech behind NFT is really interesting, NFTs arent just pictures as people think

[2:35:44] SonicAtomic: UbitSoft got mocked heavily for turning to NFTs by the internet - consumer's are lashing out at companies
[2:35:49] Dissuxx: I could make an NFT, sell it to myself for 10k, then put it up for 25% of the price and some guy thinks he's getting a bargain and I have 2.5k profit
[2:36:01] fullmetal_gamer_: No not the same cause you don't use the skins as an investment
[2:36:02] ephin_the_mage: !gamble 6
[2:36:02] StreamElements: ephin_the_mage lost 6 points in roulette and now has 7 points! FeelsBadMan

[2:36:17] SonicAtomic: @collintaylor2295 until the game/company goes belly up - it's not legit, it's not real
[2:36:26] Gizimoo86: fushdoraaah that player went flying
[2:36:42] ephin_the_mage: bet on black
[2:37:15] exomaths: What is it?
[2:37:16] Venom77: a mistake
[2:37:19] rapidanwow: a stupid mistake
[2:37:39] ChiefFirestarter: I thought it was like a goof
[2:37:50] Gizimoo86: greyScam
[2:37:59] gaypen97: The only way you can beat the casino is counting cards in blackjack but that only works with 1-2 decks otherwise its still too random, casinos also counter that by cutting the deck. I used to read alot about gambling aswell until I noticed its literally impossible to beat them long term LUL
[2:38:06] Venom77: rigged
[2:38:11] mrsmiggles69: LUL

[2:41:24] SonicAtomic: Swifty will have a special place in heaven lol
[2:41:24] WOOPsWOOP: SeemsGood
[2:41:27] Aftermath285: You gave away the prizes and they gave away your job
[2:41:28] 5antino: did you get in trouble?
[2:41:52] deftlyx: professional bullshitter
[2:41:58] Trcischmutzi: you can play game with guy from squid game :D

[2:42:07] koolkanake3: no they can gamble on stuff other than slots
[2:42:14] gaypen97: yeah and they also use like 8 decks nowdays and cutting the deck literally impossible
[2:42:16] koolkanake3: horse racing gamblers are a real thing
[2:42:38] leosabh: poker is a competition, you win because you make other lost
[2:42:43] saksa93: clapped
[2:42:48] Chosey: they casinos make a lot of money for a reason lol
[2:42:51] Rastolor: like mr incredible as an insurance salesman... told the little old lady how to get her claim approved
[2:42:53] vayhlen: @Swifty  was the name of the arcade THE FUN MACHINE?
[2:43:01] diablohunter_5: D:
[2:43:32] Venom77: have you seen 21
[2:43:39] koolkanake3: the host the game though so kind of paying for that really
[2:43:55] 5antino: it's all % chances statistics and knowing to take advantage of them
[2:44:01] Chosey: @Venom77 blackjack?
[2:44:16] exomaths: There is a video by mark rober which explains how these machines are engineered with scams in mind
[2:44:21] gaypen97: gambling problem is no joke, its so easy to get sucked in
[2:44:29] Chosey: gambling is a hell of an addiction
[2:44:30] Venom77: the movie with the blackisted guy
[2:44:34] n0niprobably: i lost 800g today deathrolling with my raidleader
[2:44:36] Lord_Juicifer: raid frames running off the screen XD
[2:44:45] koolkanake3: winning is like 10% as good of a feeling as losing it all is bad though
[2:44:48] deftlyx: instant gratification is a huge part of addiction
[2:45:04] tmnyik: Love you man keep up the good vibe ‚ù§Ô∏è

[2:45:13] Venom77: RNG is real
[2:45:16] Chosey: losing hurts too much for me to gamble lol
[2:45:24] gaypen97: one positive thing about deathrolling is that you arent playing VS the house, its player vs player but that dosent mean you cant lose all your gold
[2:45:26] exomaths: I am luck that I never feel addicted to such "random" winnings
[2:45:34] Chosey: oof
[2:45:42] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:45:51] n0niprobably: Sure, but its still a currency. And it takes time to make 800g @maruniis   So essentially you are just wasting time spent making it.
[2:45:55] ToastLamoan: When I would go to the casino I'd spend like 20 bucks tops and just slowly play nickel slots as they bring me free beer lol
[2:46:02] Chosey: see addicts would go right back the next paycheck thinking they can win it back
[2:46:06] iPFFfood: KappaHD did peanut lose any?
[2:46:06] gaypen97: been there, done that
[2:46:10] n0niprobably: +

[2:46:22] Fatal3295: Vegas wasnt built on winners
[2:46:26] metricfinn: sounds brutal
[2:46:30] FADEDGruzhyy: I used to play slots @ my previous workplace. During one month I made huge gains, never have won that much ever since. and it was 2 years ago
[2:46:38] ToastLamoan: @koolkanake3 hell ya brother
[2:46:39] Chosey: @Fatal3295 exactly
[2:46:47] RoydRage: I basically go in with the understanding that I'm going to lose the money and I'm doing this for fun.
[2:46:57] deftlyx: 3$
[2:47:17] koolkanake3: *opens coin section of wallet*
[2:47:29] ToastLamoan: Swifty got thrown out of Puerto Rico by Al Pacino for counting cards at the casino lol
[2:47:29] koolkanake3: anyone got change for a quarter?
[2:47:43] Cariffo: doesnt that work just like "ill only have 1 beer today?" and then woosh you teleport to morning wasted
[2:47:43] pixelweisheitberlin: when i went to atlantic city the least bet i was able to do on slots was like 3-5$
[2:47:54] lurifax_exe: @Swifty Show us you'r talents <3
[2:48:01] pixelweisheitberlin: and if you play something like bj etc.. you lose 50$ within a few minutes
[2:48:02] gaypen97: I deposited $300 into slots once, made a 5k gain after 3 hours and lost it all back 3 hours later. Never gambled since, felt so bad for like a month.
[2:48:09] n0niprobably: 10 bucks? i thought it would be higher tbh
[2:48:14] hello_karma_: @swifty did you see the clip of Trainwrecks winning $6 million on a slot game the other day?
[2:48:30] metashi12: @swifty how much honor do you have already?

[3:58:14] Fluffyxstuff: nah just have it be like if you hit 300k you go up a rank
[3:58:15] smokingwins: you know you dont have to right? you know this is super bad for your health right? you know you can do it a little slower?

[8:27:12] Sowiloo: the classic rank grind is just time consuming, doesn't require too much skill tbh
[8:27:33] Kyusinx: If retail is casual then why does Reddit peeps call it "Systemlands?"

[8:28:11] djkrae: catchup only if you have an 80 renown alradyt
[8:28:13] jimmypepper26: retail/classic/tbc can all be casual or sweaty
[8:28:14] captaintsubassa: @KaNcr we getting to legendaries now?
[8:28:21] crippe77: now you buy renown 40 for 500gold
[8:28:23] Onehiitter: nothing about wow is casual. Miss any time you are behind.
[8:28:50] Sowiloo: @Kyusinx it can be, like swifty says the min max is insane in retail the dungeons or be high rank
[8:29:01] KJTLX: r14 grind requires you to win almost all of the time or you'll never get enough honor. tired of all these "no skill" excuses by rank 6's
[8:29:08] Sowiloo: same for League for example, super casual friendly game but reaching challenger is difficult
[8:29:20] ezy993: If the timer runs out and your not Rank 14, would you carry the grind on till you are?
[8:29:32] crippe77: on alts you can buy renown 40 but you need al lvl60 with renown 80 first
[8:29:32] braydonsch: cute couple
[8:29:35] KaNcr: yes but you need to have a max Carr on renown at 80

[12:26:18] alyllyrattv: Tienen que quemar el juego entero y crear uno nuevo xd
[12:26:21] 1SRCaptN: WAOW man! swifty!! i watched you when i was 12 haha! im 28 now, hows stuff?
[12:26:23] frriiedd: nothing tbh
[12:26:29] frriiedd: i enjoy it
[12:26:46] 1SRCaptN: and the most crazy thing is you dont look a day older!
[12:26:52] frriiedd: i dont really find anything like tedious it all feels easy to level new characters and stuff
[12:26:58] frriiedd: jus do some m+ and raids ez<3
[12:27:15] OtherguyTTV: which spec you leveled with?
[12:27:21] frriiedd: what u think swifty?>
[12:27:25] ivarmeh: it should never have become retail.. They should have kept on keeping it like classic with new content they changed something that worked for the sake of change. Not for the better..
[12:28:09] frriiedd: the game feels alot better in retail tho
[12:28:19] frriiedd: and each class is super customizable
[12:28:20] frriiedd: LOL
[12:28:26] ivarmeh: maby
[12:28:38] frriiedd: and all games evolve brothers <3
[12:28:41] saedfjert: u missed rook d7
[12:28:42] ivarmeh: but wow is no longer fun for bad players like me
[12:28:43] frriiedd: the proof is all around u
[12:29:16] frriiedd: it is man i  have a buddy who solely run m+2-6
[12:29:20] frriiedd: like low mythics
[12:29:30] ivarmeh: its no longer enough to put in the hours
[12:29:34] 1SRCaptN: Are you still gaming normal world of warcraft? hows your warrior?
[12:29:39] ivarmeh: i used to lie kthat ^^
[12:29:43] frriiedd: super easy super chill but you still get the same feel for doing ur rotatioin and stuff
[12:30:00] frriiedd: i just do 15's
[12:30:06] frriiedd: and heroic version of newest raid
[12:30:09] frriiedd: not mythic
[12:30:10] frriiedd: but still

[12:31:14] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[12:31:29] Rastolor: if you could do everything up to level 60 without it being too low level for you in retail that would make it a better experience... old content doesn't mean anything because you out level it too quickly
[12:31:42] frriiedd: its not erased you have the mogs
[12:31:45] frriiedd: and the achievements
[12:32:10] colevs: @frriiedd All the gear progression is basically reset every patch though
[12:32:15] frriiedd: but yeah i get that
[12:32:30] ivarmeh: yeah but there should be something that sticks
[12:32:30] frriiedd: right yeah
[12:32:33] authorJeMac: Doubling up the rooks was prolly better
[12:32:34] frriiedd: but its like,,,
[12:32:42] ivarmeh: liek in classic you get that one piece i BRD and you grind for it
[12:32:43] authorJeMac: This works tho
[12:32:45] frriiedd: why would u want to be in the best gear
[12:32:47] frriiedd: forever
[12:32:53] athenonx: John Carlsen is it? :p
[12:32:56] ivarmeh: and it lasts you the whole expo
[12:33:17] authorJeMac: Just premove all teh way to Queen
[12:33:23] frriiedd: doesnt that seem like a menial chore that the game forces onto u
[12:33:24] Kyusinx: What timezone does WoW calander go off of?
[12:33:26] frriiedd: like if u want bis
[12:33:30] ivarmeh: but i gives you a reason to go back to get that i thing and it gives you a sense of what you did made sense
[12:33:34] frriiedd: way more time
[12:33:43] frriiedd: than jus learning a boss fight joining a guild and raiding 6 hours a week
[12:33:45] frriiedd: after work
[12:33:49] Kyusinx: Says event ends at 6am - But both local and server time for me is past 6am
[12:33:51] frriiedd: and doing a couple m+ on the weekend lol
[12:33:55] ivarmeh: it just sux to suddely be irrelevant if you diodnt play for 2-3 weaks

[12:37:04] authorJeMac: EverQuest kept you playing just by being hard
[12:37:08] Araghast: all thescandals aside, i think the fuckups in game turn me away the strongest. the bots, the boosts in TBC and the ruined season of mastery.

[12:37:49] frriiedd: i believe that..ww monks??
[12:37:51] Dalsonson: ACTUALLY True
[12:38:23] Araghast: i like that everybody has to level through - on average- 2 months of leveling. the levels fell earned... but the boost ruined that

[12:40:00] frriiedd: retail isnt about having "1 main" like you can easily maintain 2-3 characters at a decent ilvl (245ish) so like your used to playing different specs and classes
[12:40:03] Enmael00: YES>... i remember going glad stance in ashran with ancient artifact

[15:15:04] Seoken1: Lol @Swifty . I used to run a bracket stacking discord, and I would require screenshots like 12 hrs before reset for the top 3 brackets each week. Literally we would have 20+ people all onboard, and we'd still have "accidental" bracket breakers, every single week LUL

[17:39:27] Cmgaming7: if there was a boost on tbc there probably will be one in wrath
[17:39:32] bussiefacee: What did you do for this new year Swifty
[17:39:33] unknownworldstv: @wizjay1990 u get xp by handing in 3 marks of honor after a win
[17:39:35] guss2084: its 50% ranking since it took about 12 weeks to get r14 in vanilla
[17:39:45] ReaperKick89: Is Sasha awake this early too?
[17:39:45] Knullzey: People thought TBC was going to bring a lot of people back......
[17:39:48] Seoken1: I remember in classic some people would farm the haryps in AV for xp LUL
[17:39:56] dubsfxqt: why dont play rog or warr?
[17:39:57] lenestusss: Do you think that blizzard will get rid of factions? No more alliance or horde? @swifty
[17:40:03] Anavolia: if they allow boost i will play wotlk
[17:40:09] loodacris88: Glad to finally catch a stream! Wish you all the best this new year Swifty!
[17:40:15] lichloay: You get 4k exp for marks turn in still
[17:40:32] warriorlord8: taking a food break
[17:40:36] Kapill89: @Lidyalue i think when wrath classic comes out they will give a free boost to anyone who plays, kinda like they did for TBC
[17:40:41] exomaths: I think we will get wotlk in 1.5 year. Arent we due for a new retail expac in this year 2022?
[17:40:43] SirHexalon: you can still make faction merge for raid content

[17:40:50] Crayonmuncher03: blizzard talked about getting rid of it because it places a barrier on alot of players in this day of age and alot of gameplay is both factions working together
[17:40:57] CardinalTX: Blizzard also said they wouldnt do classic............
[17:40:59] GlennyPojken: how you streamed for almost 18 hours!? :O
[17:40:59] dudatron: to be fair, they said a lot of things over the years then changed their mind :D
[17:41:01] guss2084: Rumor is 'factions' not mattering in future xpac
[17:41:04] Zarunax: Warcraft was Orcs vs Humans at the start. Removing the factions would remove the spirit of WoW
[17:41:07] SirHexalon: I mean retail really is more a game lobby than a world/rpg
[17:41:09] Devismo: so many dots LUL
[17:41:15] JonVonZombie: @dubsfxqt he plays what he likes
[17:41:15] voltwey: hey swift, you went to the gym today?
[17:41:27] savioccs: dude, druids are so annoying
[17:41:29] Aidler: but cross faction play will be much more prominent and accessible in the future
[17:41:31] ReaperKick89: Legion could've been factionless but nooooo arrrow woman walked away
[17:41:32] warriorlord8: blizzard said they wouldnt do classic and they did it
[17:41:40] CardinalTX: Blizzard said.........copium
[17:41:41] warriorlord8: blizzard said they wouldnt do level boosts and they did it
[17:41:47] rouji: Do you think it's easier to grind honor as dps or healer?
[17:41:48] exomaths: How many hours of grinding you think is left?
[17:41:50] dubsfxqt: @jonvonzombie ik but shamy look like low
[17:41:54] guss2084: did it not once but twice lol
[17:41:55] warriorlord8: blizzard said they'll make the game better and they didnt

[17:42:27] Anavolia: it is only fair we already done all the work 12 years ago lol
[17:42:28] notoriousami: is it worth leveling a new char in classic or is classic dead
[17:42:35] silverbulletdevil: How come you lost brackets :(
[17:43:23] guss2084: @notoriousami Do it in SOM. 40% xp boost for quests.  Toon will drop to classic when SOM is over.   No one is on Classic servers
[17:43:25] Aidler: well tbt Blizz introduced countless quality of life changes with 9.1.5... it's on the right course but still a long way to go
[17:43:27] Crayonmuncher03: think SOM is alot more ally populated
[17:43:31] OGforze: blizzard is that president you wouldn't vote, but there is no better one...
[17:43:33] Blitzylive: its also holiday season
[17:43:33] ReckageTV: Is this classic
[17:43:49] guss2084: @reckagetv Season of Mastery
[17:43:56] ReaperKick89: Because swifty doesn't talk to anyone under rank 10 :P
[17:44:15] bk9302478321594307: ofc allies are in bigger numbers, hence the instant join in battlegrounds :)
