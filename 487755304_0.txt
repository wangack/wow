[6:59:17] Arwaria: dilly has good commentary but he gets carried away with the banter

[7:00:29] Beli_Mar: @TeleiosTV I get that. But 5 hours of being the bigger man gets ruined if he spends the entire finale set sinking just as low as Dilly.

[7:29:36] nayrb75: order won
[7:29:55] tysonjamez: streaming clearly doesnt understand that one team only had one chance and every other team had two @Dderserei, nothing against his accolades however
[7:30:38] tysonjamez: @Xzuen sperging out how? this is the first time ive ever witnessed a double elim bracket with no winners advantage
[7:30:40] fenidia: everyone had 2 chances
[7:30:50] tysonjamez: wrong

[7:32:29] Dderserei: They had the final bracket reset for a little while a couple of years ago but the players didn't like it, from memory. If the players prefer it this way, then I don't think there's an issue

[7:35:27] Streamingfm: Having a game advantage doesn’t work with the necessity for counter picks, and nobody enjoyed having to play two finals series

[7:37:48] Streamingfm: Yes every tournament is like this
[7:38:28] wetleafx: oh okay. i came late. i didnt know if it was like yesterday lol
[7:38:34] Streamingfm: Sorry meant second pick, if the meta is defined enough it’d be a default team for the winner bracket team no matter what
[7:38:45] Streamingfm: Part of the wow tourney thrill is the first blind pick
[7:39:22] tysonjamez: giving a team one game advantage just means the first game they 'play' is the blind though right?
[7:39:23] Moobot: Today's casters are Sid "Supatease" Compston, Joe "Joefernandes" Fernandes, and Dillon "Dilly" Montero.
[7:39:31] Streamingfm: since you get that second pick advantage in the final game on a tied series
