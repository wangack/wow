[3:33:17] Aaradin: lol its normal just trying to help us not die
[3:33:32] Aaradin: group seems pretty solid
[3:34:22] Fatest_Fat_Tony: but its not like they need to redistribute the mobile $$$ to wow, or any other game when they already make a profit
[3:35:32] Neys7: flawed thinking, why not reinvest in other new mobile games that are less prone to risk and that you can pump out with less budget and getting bigger ROIs, I think that's the main concern that should be discussed
[3:35:36] Exxcar: @Fatest_Fat_Tony Its more "Hey Archlight rumble can help cover the basic costs of WoW, so more money can be put  into development"
[3:36:08] mooncaster2034: here goes the real single tartget test
[3:36:15] Fatest_Fat_Tony: @Exxcar but why do that when wow already is a profitable game? its not like its losing $$$
[3:37:03] Exxcar: If putting more money into it would allow for say safer faster development, which in turn is MORE profit
[3:37:22] Exxcar: Remember, to corporations its not about just making a profit, its about MAXIMIZING profit
[3:37:55] Fatest_Fat_Tony: @Exxcar weve had that BS with faster devolopment eg faster xpacs since WOD, didnt we?
[3:38:12] Neys7: wasn't it wrath?
[3:38:12] WoW_StandalonE: lol
[3:38:14] Exxcar: We had faster development with same/fewer developers
[3:39:09] WoW_StandalonE: every game has to be profitable by itself, there is no handouts from other games
[3:39:25] Fatest_Fat_Tony: to me i doesnt show, it seems the same 2+ years per xpac
[3:39:50] theDirtyon3: I see we have a bunch of business expert in here this am
[3:40:10] Aaradin: lol i got hit like 2 times from the tank being on other sides
[3:40:10] manmower: big dps loss if the circles on ground hit you
[3:40:15] Aaradin: but on normal you can take like 2 hits lol
[3:40:15] Fatest_Fat_Tony: @theDirtyon3 no one was claiming that. so its only in ur imagination
[3:40:18] Aaradin: on heroic its basically a one shot
[3:40:38] Aaradin: or it use to be anyway
[3:41:08] Aaradin: they have gutted most of the raid tho

[5:50:39] 2wentyx4our: Like you’re never behind
[5:50:50] 91Niki: @Taz_85 Blueberry Acai flavor

[5:53:37] Stonefather: It's completed already you can walk outside and turn it in.
[5:53:39] the_general01: @insanity2195 :( sadge
[5:54:25] TacticalWee: what do sky shards do?
[5:54:43] Mr_Pennywise_: @insanity2195 i am the same i did try it and my heart did not like it :(
[5:54:48] OrganicJKW: 3 shards = 1 skill point.

[5:57:45] OrganicJKW: 1 skill point comes from things like completing a group dungeon, completing a public dungeon, main storyline quests, etc. But "shards" have to be combined.
[5:57:58] nocturnal_2195: @mr_pennywise_ wow that sucks
[5:58:07] SuperSteve43: ESO baller here...just sell everything non gear and decon all gear. Just sayin. Itll help inventory issues immensely.

[5:58:31] SuperSteve43: have fun though homie.
[5:59:03] meaniehead17: Chat, for someone who is looking to try out eso, what is an easy class to play while starting out?
[5:59:11] SuperSteve43: Templ;ar
[5:59:15] SuperSteve43: Templar
[5:59:26] Slitze: yeah because ppl wanted something cooler than a card game. hopefully it just means next year we get something way cool
[5:59:27] SuperSteve43: yup yup
[5:59:30] rymerre: card game as a whole system is kinda shit
[5:59:34] manmower: is there a rogue?
[5:59:45] Angryfist40: Templars are easy mode
[5:59:45] SuperSteve43: yup, its called a nightblade

[6:06:11] the_stinkywizard: been looking into ESO, im coming from new world and trying to find something new to play since new worlds pretty dead just wondering if its worth playing
[6:06:12] manmower: thought there was a mage with a pet earlier
[6:06:21] SuperSteve43: That Addon you using for numbers/popups is very customizable. Itll take some time to set up the way you like but it is doable.
[6:06:27] belfastcl: @manmower sorcerers have pets too
[6:06:40] manmower: this combat looks similar to new world
[6:07:06] TmT_eh: ESO offers a lot more than new world imo
[6:07:12] SuperSteve43: @manmower I said the same thing when I first saw New World. Never played NW though.
[6:07:17] belfastcl: turn in your quest up the ramp
[6:07:38] SuperSteve43: DPS is king baby. in this game at least.
[6:08:00] Razor514: ice staff

[6:08:05] SuperSteve43: ^
[6:08:07] Maelstromboli: Ice staff
[6:08:09] OrganicJKW: ESO's housing and crafting are some of the very best in the genre. Plus, they put out content 4x/year.
[6:08:11] the_stinkywizard: lmao
[6:08:29] the_stinkywizard: thank guys i think i may start playing soon then
[6:08:29] manmower: how's the ESO guild functionality?
[6:08:39] Maelstromboli: Can block using magicka with ice staff
[6:08:42] SuperSteve43: In waht terms @manmower
[6:08:57] SuperSteve43: A lot of organization is on discord usually.
[6:09:35] TmT_eh: @manmower you can join multiple guilds in eso
[6:09:54] Sylphy_TV: Ima dip out for the night, take care ya'll towLove towHAMUP
[6:10:00] Maelstromboli: Yeah 50

[6:11:50] SuperSteve43: yup, Decon at all major crafting tables. Then sell all of your other items. Again, helps with inventory issue and you level your so called "profession.

[6:15:14] belfastcl: ice staff has some cool aoes that slow enemies, etc
[6:15:18] SuperSteve43: you drop dots usually...the best one is called wall of elements.
[6:15:20] Waltwhite23: what are the addon names for the quest list and the group frame?
[6:15:57] SuperSteve43: It definitely is different.
[6:15:59] brilargaming: Gold river is stepping down. That’s sad
[6:16:11] SuperSteve43: like anything more you play the better and more comfortable you get.
[6:16:11] Rottencoarse: @brilar1967  yup :(
[6:16:25] Llamatude: @brilar1967 who is gold river?
[6:16:26] OrganicJKW: Easiest thing to do is fill your skill bar with skills you want to level, swap to ice staff bar when you turn in a quest and that xp goes toward that bar/gear equipped.
[6:16:39] SuperSteve43: BTW, you got a lot of XP on that last dungeon because you completed the quest in it.
[6:17:20] nocturnal_2195: @llamatude the game director  of lost ark

[6:18:06] SuperSteve43: ^
[6:18:17] Rottencoarse: destrution staff?
[6:18:21] Rottencoarse: *destruction
[6:18:26] nocturnal_2195: @llamatude I think do to health issues
[6:18:42] belfastcl: ice, light, and fire staff share a skill line, called destro staff
[6:18:58] SuperSteve43: Destruction Staff means Ice Staff, Fires Staff, Lighting Staff. All 3. FYI
[6:19:00] Slitze: yeah ice staffs are in the same category as destruction
[6:19:03] Llamatude: @insanity2195 i would think game director has a TON of stress and can lead to health issues
[6:19:23] SuperSteve43: Like anything.
[6:19:26] SuperSteve43: @Llamatude
[6:20:12] SuperSteve43: This is a "delve'. Overland dungeon. always has one crystal in them.
