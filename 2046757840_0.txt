[0:40:53] forshard: ????
[0:40:54] DontDv8: what if it was a glad mount in the trading post?
[0:41:01] taylors09: @Swishinn trolling
[0:41:07] FamLeeGaming: @DontDv8 again who cares lol
[0:41:50] brezkovtv: what do you care what mount you ride, the mount doesn't help your arena game in general
[0:41:53] Nezzy243: hell no
[0:42:00] joe_g_433: just play the game and stop worrying about who has what.
[0:42:09] realdreadx: that would kill pvp and there would be no more wow tourneys bc everyone wants to be a glad
[0:42:16] Guelag: 90% of chat rn with mop challenge modes bought it LUL
[0:42:19] DontDv8: glad mount selection like the vicious saddles
[0:42:19] disquared: !drops
[0:42:20] Nezzy243: its an achiev that was earned at that period of time
[0:42:24] infiergo: Only collecters cry about that
[0:42:25] forshard: @dreadworldx ???? 󠀀
[0:42:28] thorgasm69420: yeah like the saddles, one per season
[0:42:29] infiergo: Kekw
[0:42:31] FamLeeGaming: @dreadworldx thats not why I PvP
[0:42:32] realdreadx: in the trading post
[0:42:35] Solastro: @dreadworldx if shadowlands didnt manage to kill pvp, nothing will
[0:42:35] infiergo: No way
[0:42:39] Nezzy243: it wouldnt kill pvp but it wouldnt be good
[0:42:39] realdreadx: being able to choose ur glad would be sick
[0:42:42] FamLeeGaming: People dont PvP for mounts.
[0:42:44] michxxlh: give them all my glad mounts ngl idc
[0:42:45] alabamahammer02: agree
[0:42:48] infiergo: Why would it kill pvp
[0:42:49] thorgasm69420: just trying to entice more players
[0:42:54] alabamahammer02: WoW is no longer the "flex" game it used to be.
[0:42:54] TommyTribal: being able to get any glad mount might motivate some people to play more so they can get the ones they desire specifically
[0:42:56] infiergo: Pvp would be more alive
[0:42:56] taylors09: @Solastro bfa
[0:43:06] tamilveeran: hey
[0:43:12] infiergo: Imagine ppl q for old sets
[0:43:12] reavethederp: it is kinda a cool thing i think, to have some mounts no longer obtainable
[0:43:16] alabamahammer02: Transmog essentially ruined "flex"
[0:43:20] VonShank: the only reason i pvp is to get the mogs and stuff so if you would let me just buy them from the trading post i would stop pvping
[0:43:24] michxxlh: make it like the pvp mount when u get gald u get a token and buy the mount
[0:43:32] realdreadx: @VonShank exactly
[0:43:34] forshard: bring back welfaire epics and Nathria/Season 1 gear. Nothing makes PvP feel fresh like a ton of pve'rs jumping in to get "free" gear
[0:43:42] alabamahammer02: Why gatekeep mounts at all?
[0:43:43] Swishinn: whats the point in limited time rewards then
[0:43:45] alabamahammer02: nobody cares
[0:43:49] Nezzy243: @VonShank thats not what were saying tho, youd have to wait years to see this seasons on the trading post
[0:44:01] clicket: @alabamahammer02 people obviously care, that's why it's such a hot topic right now
[0:44:01] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:44:04] Nezzy243: talking about old unobtainable things rn
[0:44:20] joe_g_433: @nezzy243 exactly. it’s been 10 years.
[0:44:27] forshard: @clicket tbh its a hot topic because wow news is otherwise dead until war within beta. Its a slow news cycle currently.
[0:44:34] Nezzy243: @joe_g_433 exactly what?
[0:44:34] infiergo: Enabling old set, mounts nothing wrong bringing them back in trading post is shittiest idea
[0:44:43] Solastro: also people are engagement farming with weird takes
[0:44:49] Swishinn: the only reason i pushed glad at all was because i thought the mounts were sick
[0:44:58] nerdyorc_: hey dew how you dewing
[0:44:59] magixss: @alabamahammer02 why not, just because I didn't put enough time in to earn something, why should I be rewarded for it?
[0:45:02] Swishinn: id never q if i knew i could just wait for the trading post lol
[0:45:04] realdreadx: @Swishinn what if they gave them to everyone? would u care if a pver got it for free?
[0:45:09] VonShank: half of the wow player base is casual collectors if you negate that you lose that whole section of your player base but then again they may be catering towards the zoomers because we are all getting too old
[0:45:18] clicket: @Swishinn yeah I'm in this boat too
[0:45:22] FamLeeGaming: @Swishinn then youre not a pvper youre a mount collector...
[0:45:24] Solastro: @Swishinn if it takes 10 years for them to appear on the trading post you still wouldnt queu and just wait?
[0:45:27] forshard: @Swishinn if you saw a sick dragonriding mount would you look at the trading post with a glad nether drake from 2007 and think "you know what ill just wait 10 years to get it in the post"
[0:45:32] Nezzy243: @VonShank or you open up those casual collectors that want it that bad to not be casual
[0:45:32] brizz3: tbh who sees that lion mount and goes oooo thats the aotc wod mount how lucky..aotc mounts are free for anyone who tries at that time anyway. glad mounts are a different story
[0:45:35] taylors09: damn bro clean on the destro
[0:45:55] realdreadx: would def impact awc tourneys/pvp in general
[0:45:57] Swishinn: @FamLeeGaming i am a pvper. just didnt care for 3s rating until i had to just to get the mount
[0:46:34] Swishinn: there needs to be some kind of "prestige" or "magic" about some items in the game
[0:47:11] FamLeeGaming: @Swishinn I agree 100% but lets be honest. That prestige feeling has been lost for years. And its not coming back anytime soon.
[0:47:26] forshard: Cutting Edge and AotC and Glad mounts are still exclusive. At least for another (checks notes) 11 years. Even if they give 2013 mounts away via trading post
[0:47:56] grainger123: i dont see it being a bad idea if u get glad u can choose a mount from another season. It just shouldn't be from any of the seasons pre change where they let 2400 rated 100 wins get glad mounts
[0:47:59] dawsonator171: like the war bear recolor?
[0:47:59] Solastro: the dumbest thing is they havent confirmed anything about that mount or how it's obtained... they've never said its going on trading post, its just datamined shit
[0:48:18] wrogDG: do u have the magic cock tho
[0:48:19] Solastro: do you know how much weird datamined stuff has never appeared in the game when it goes live
[0:48:31] Swishinn: @FamLeeGaming i disagree. when i see someone using a hard to earn title, a hard to earn mount, or even a transmog set, you know that mf grinded for it and earned it
[0:48:42] miserybro: magic rooster op
[0:48:46] DontDv8: i hope the tcg mounts dont go on trading post tbh
[0:48:48] The_Gofishy: just collecting mmr

[0:48:49] Swishinn: if everyone can get everything, then nothing has value or prestige anymore.
[0:48:54] dawsonator171: chuck has a magic cock irl. as we speak he probably has another one underway he doesn't yet know about.
[0:48:54] juicymeld: was so happy to get the weather machine. and the imp in a ball from trade post

[0:49:16] joe_g_433: there is supposed to be a Pandaria time “running” thing in a new patch. probably has to do with that.
[0:49:36] Carcer69: only collecting ws around here
[0:49:55] Solastro: AOTC mounts are only prestigious for the first 2 weeks of a patch, after that they're novelty
[0:49:56] brezkovtv: this thing with the mounts is the smallest problem
[0:49:57] DontDv8: @symbolism369 only the untradable ones i thought
[0:50:04] forshard: Mounts havent been legendarily special since like what.. Legion? After a certain patch blizzard just started shotgun adding new mounts. Shadowlands/DFlight added so many mounts

[4:18:06] FlynnFluff: but spell steal give clear casting which gives more damage so it’s sort of part of the rotation no?
[4:18:11] Laythos: they cant oom
[4:18:15] Laythos: i swear
[4:18:15] zachgamegodx: they’ll always end up broken if they don’t break down the foundations, like when they lowered outlaws dmg in PvP going into DF they were dormant for a bit then once they got dmg buffed were back to where we were in sl
[4:18:15] Swishinn: doesnt do anything
[4:18:18] knappster15: you can't oom
[4:18:24] Swishinn: arcane surge drains all your mana but gives you insane regen
[4:18:25] Thunder4o: most annoying things is to get purged on primordial wave just between NS Healing wave
[4:18:30] Swishinn: and you have evo
[4:18:30] knappster15: even if you oom, arcane surge resets you
[4:18:31] MaybeRespect: Surge gives you all mana back

[4:18:33] FoxiekittenWoW: @dinoman78 they are not broadcasted before the weekend, but people are allowed to stream them if they want
[4:18:33] MaybeRespect: And evo
[4:18:34] FlynnFluff: makes them hit hard and move while cast
[4:18:38] iggy_pls: but you get it back like instantly
[4:18:41] SeeJayX: that clone on your NS was sadge
[4:18:48] voygard: dont they have cranked mana regen when they borst?
[4:18:49] whitewallss: they can oom however mana regen is insane
[4:18:54] Axl_Rose94: @MaybeRespect arcane dont play evo in pvp

[5:02:17] Dirkdigglier: Sounds like devoker needs a dmg buff

[5:12:14] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:12:50] buffevoker: @FoxiekittenWoW True and when you have mehh who i think was the best healer its just dominance
[5:13:36] stljay73: @FoxiekittenWoW that is because rougue and mage are always meta
[5:13:46] Endri_ttv: Mehh is the best aggro healer
[5:13:49] theodeth: ggs
[5:13:49] FoxiekittenWoW: @buffevoker haha yea i also think mehh is the best, its unfortunately he is taking a break :S
[5:13:50] Axl_Rose94: that was close
[5:13:54] alexanderekermark: gg
[5:14:11] FoxiekittenWoW: @stljay73 hmm maybe, but they won a whole season only playing lock/boomie
[5:14:11] sup_champ: you popped off that game
[5:14:16] Mortifiedwow: @cdewx pika is killing the poison totem
[5:14:33] Nemiha21: they were triple-dotting this time
[5:14:42] stljay73: @FoxiekittenWoW in BFA? when
[5:15:00] FoxiekittenWoW: @stljay73 in DF
[5:15:17] Endri_ttv: @FoxiekittenWoW The reason why they are so good is because they are best friends IRL aswel, they can say whatever to eachother ingame and they will keep it ingame, while IRL they are best friends
[5:15:24] Cybernytez: Trillr > pika and its not even close dewTrill
[5:15:43] Endri_ttv: @FoxiekittenWoW So its like if they get mad at something, they speak openly up about it while keeping private life on the side
[5:15:54] buffevoker: Im glad this season there is a EU-NA cross tourney
[5:16:21] bignoooodle: theres a lan?
[5:16:28] FoxiekittenWoW: not lan
[5:16:50] FoxiekittenWoW: but there is two cross region tournaments between every second cup
[5:17:04] Cybernytez: What, online? I hate these 200 latency cross tourneys... they need LANs again
[5:17:44] bignoooodle: i miss blizzcon ..

[5:17:47] buffevoker: The Mid-Season Clash is a new Cross-Region event in 2024. It will take place after AWC Cup 2 and takes place in Dragonflight Season 3. The event will take place over a single weekend, and will not contribute AWC Points toward the AWC Dragonflight Grand Finals in Season 4.
[5:18:03] gelatokush: yes i agree they need to send liquid to eu to Lan
[5:18:10] buffevoker: Its kinda nice to still see EU vs NA teams
[5:18:22] stljay73: they need to bring back the solo shuffle tournament
[5:18:56] Cybernytez: Nah fk these 200 latency games, they tell naffin
[5:19:08] kala112: state of PvP looks horrible
[5:19:22] snarky03: frenzy
[5:19:38] FoxiekittenWoW: @Cybernytez they do since it equal for all, if you lose a game the next one is played in your region

[5:21:00] Kanooog: Awesome content btw.
[5:21:08] Cybernytez: @foxiekittenwow lol it doesnt matter every game is fake with this latency so its just every single game is bs
[5:21:14] dooshken: spellsteal seems better on other specs cause it at least makes them oom
[5:21:19] Yliche: does rogue or mage carry that team harder if they're insane?
[5:21:20] difunto86: sup dew
[5:21:38] zachgamegodx: mage has 0.8s globals
[5:21:38] gelatokush: the fact that arcane use spell steal as part of builder in dps rotation is sick
[5:21:47] foxtko: foxtko subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[5:21:51] Riddrik: you can hear the rogue/mage depression in their voices
[5:21:56] zachgamegodx: it’s not as good as blasting @gelatokush noov
[5:21:57] Hardstyler4: Whats the APM tracker? @cdewx
[5:22:00] tommymage: no
[5:22:02] FoxiekittenWoW: @Cybernytez there is several eu players compteting in the na awc this season, so all those games are also fake? How are they fake, you get equal amount of games on each region
[5:22:02] tommymage: like 1 sec
[5:22:05] theronpaul: god that sounds fun @zachgamegodx
[5:22:06] tommymage: with all the haste
[5:22:44] gelatokush: @zachgamegodx tell that to the guy spellstealing every 4 sec XD
[5:22:45] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:22:55] FoxiekittenWoW: @Cybernytez sure lan would be better, but calling them fake is just silly.
[5:23:04] Cybernytez: @foxiekittenwow  you dont get it^^
[5:23:23] Semis394: is that a AWC team?
[5:23:34] FoxiekittenWoW: @Cybernytez i guess not
[5:23:47] zachgamegodx: @gelatokush if he was going for max pve dmg he’d use the mana on missles or blast
[5:23:51] jtrxa: the problem is the infinite spam
[5:23:52] Swishinn: kidney shot exists tho
[5:23:54] PeptoAbysmal: arcane spellsteal is obnoxious af
[5:23:56] Hardstyler4: Purge?
[5:24:12] dooshken: they just need to make spellsteal for Arcane like it is for other specs
[5:25:04] Cybernytez: @foxiekittenwow but u definetly land on my ignore now for my correct statement that these games are fake and callin me silly fot this literal fact, i def dont need sillyness in my life
[5:25:06] gelatokush: @zachgamegodx im not gonan argue i dont play arcane from my understanding they resolve more on spell steal when targeted on the move to help proc cl earcastings

[5:26:06] zachgamegodx: it does, but it’s like you could spend mana on blast, do 100k dmg while generating the proc or spell steal. one is more raw dmg the other is most often better bc it’s instant and you’re taking off a buff from the enemy
[5:26:14] spujetti: wait spellsteall gives them missile procs too? that shit is so borken
[5:26:32] FoxiekittenWoW: @Cybernytez the only thing i was calling silly was your take on cross region games not you personally, but i guess the snowflake is strong in this one
[5:27:59] lfkappachupa: !macro
[5:28:02] lfkappachupa: !macros
[5:28:02] zachgamegodx: its a bad mechanic regardless, but mana being arcanes major resource isn’t going anywhere due to the spec fantasy so they’d need to put a cd on steal
[5:28:03] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1

[5:28:47] zachgamegodx: or they could make it not generate clear casting for arcane while still costing mana, making it a clear trade off but they could still spell steal infinitely
[5:29:16] spujetti: i think it would make more sense to just make it cost mana. since spellsteal is obv designed to be pressed
[5:29:33] spujetti: like in pve arcane presses arcane explosion to fish for missle procs instead
[5:29:50] zachgamegodx: cost no mana?
[5:29:57] gelatokush: put a cd on it like dh purge sort of
[5:30:12] spujetti: nah make it cost the same as fire/frost
[5:30:23] spujetti: that way your punished for spamming it but you can still do it to fish for procs
[5:31:18] zachgamegodx: there’s ways around that
