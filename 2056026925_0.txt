[0:10:09] Galois_rg: "hero talents" are just talents with the word hero, idk why they are doing this branding thing
[0:10:17] Celestial990: HOLY content
[0:10:20] Nitruos: priest one is fukin lit
[0:10:49] Nitruos: you can only take the 2 aligned with yours

[0:11:43] theredbellpepper: shadowlands
[0:11:46] zamow1994: but treants are not it idk
[0:11:48] hivplus__: like 9 years ago maybe
[0:11:54] Nitruos: the regrowth talent on here is nuts
[0:12:00] Nitruos: spoilers
[0:12:28] theredbellpepper: even better is that trees can grief hard when used at the wrong time
[0:12:42] Nitruos: lmfao
[0:12:46] TwicksTV: man now we have to fuckin convince moonkins to take taunt trees
[0:12:49] TwicksTV: goddamnit man
[0:12:52] Pyrrha_GG: yeah, but the moonkin terrorists werent going to use it to help the tank anyway
[0:12:54] Nitruos: they have to pick them up
[0:12:56] Nitruos: which they wont
[0:12:56] dknamey: more reason to hate boomies Pog
[0:13:15] Nitruos: near the target implies they need to be picked up
[0:13:53] Nitruos: you get all points in this tree right?
[0:13:59] Nitruos: at max lvl
[0:14:04] theredbellpepper: yes, but not if you pick the other hero tree
[0:14:06] guynormally: you get every single hero talent, so you will automatically take Protective Growth
[0:14:27] guynormally: within the tree yeah
[0:14:38] Nitruos: ya the choice nodes are the choices

[0:17:46] theredbellpepper: this seems cool, except isn't 5 seconds crazy low?
[0:17:53] Nitruos: yeah the numbers are super wip though
[0:18:18] Greannan: You get a buffer of 5 sec to use your CDs. Seems undertuned, but cool ability
[0:18:37] theredbellpepper: 5 second for the 1 min cds seems fine, but they should probably increase it for the longer cds.
[0:18:45] Nitruos: yeah on the lower cds its good
[0:18:57] Nitruos: u think this is boring the mage one seemed giga boring
[0:19:02] Nitruos: but the priest one is giga giga wokege
[0:19:23] leubinator: dark ranger is even more basic
[0:19:26] PurpleKami: I thought priest sounded giga snooze
[0:19:45] Nitruos: hots dots
[0:19:56] katpoopy: priest sounded like: we have AST at home
[0:20:04] Nitruos: hopefully one is better at healing
[0:20:06] Nitruos: and the other is damage
[0:20:09] Nitruos: something like that would be ideal

[0:24:34] Nitruos: you can point feathers at ppl who cares
[0:24:51] zachl_: @yumytv just read druid and im really fuckin mad theyre pushing this treant playstyle
[0:24:54] zachl_: its so cringe.
[0:25:00] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd . o O ( donki )
[0:25:07] Nitruos: its only 1 of the 2 choices
[0:25:08] zachl_: ok listening
[0:25:13] dimsy__: COPIUM
[0:25:15] astrinovska: kalieynPrayge
[0:25:36] zachl_: but treants are just too overtuned
[0:25:36] tvilk: "choose"
[0:25:38] dimsy__: Copeless
[0:25:39] zamow1994: you wont be able to choose in this game
[0:25:40] tvilk: you play the ones thats better
[0:25:41] zachl_: now theyre gonna be even more important
[0:25:42] Appl3man: until you're forced to play the treant one for the 8% dr
[0:25:43] zachl_: tvilk knows
[0:25:43] zamow1994: one is meta
[0:25:44] reppap: Sadeg . o O ( hiii )
[0:25:48] tvilk: theres no choice ever
[0:25:52] Harthad: trueee
[0:25:53] jonpelf: cool, i can choose to play treants or i can choose to not heal
[0:25:58] dimsy__: Sadeg hiii
[0:25:59] zachl_: yeah i see what ur saying but from what i look at this you have treants or gg
[0:25:59] theredbellpepper: healing isn't always as simple as pure throughput COPIUM
[0:26:09] zachl_: am i wrong @tvilk
[0:26:20] Nitruos: it'll probably get tuned a bit
[0:26:23] reppap: treants own
[0:26:35] Nitruos: yeah here it comes
[0:26:39] zachl_: @reppap yeah 40% of my healing breakdown ???
[0:26:43] popularviber: xdd
[0:26:43] tvilk: @zachl_ not entirely. like if treent style has shit tuning you dont play it but yeah basically you'll always play whichever is better on paper doesnt matter how it feels
[0:26:45] nalegi07: I know buddy that is in the priest discord, this works like twisted fate
[0:26:48] nalegi07: from League
[0:26:54] Greannan: Blessing of summer but random
[0:26:55] Drohgoh: nah its not random. it just means if u get the healing one, u give mana.
[0:27:05] miyo2322: isn't this just putting a system onto another system, only tha this time it'll be impossible to balance?
[0:27:12] Nitruos: the healing one gives mana and the phys/magic one gives haste
[0:27:14] Oracle_WoW: read the capstone
[0:27:14] theredbellpepper: it's going to be like ruby whelp shell probably. You have to trigger it the right way
[0:27:14] Greannan: No way thats how it works
[0:27:15] zachl_: @miyo2322 yes.
[0:27:18] blaylock2: its blizzard it will work flawlessly.
[0:27:30] Pyrrha_GG: haste for DPS/tanks, mana for healers?
[0:27:31] Greannan: Read the next one too
[0:27:36] miyo2322: @zachl_ I was hoping I missed something LUL
[0:27:37] aimbim: Probably Based on the role
[0:27:37] popularviber: @miyo2322 the current talent system is already impossible to balance OMEGALUL
[0:27:39] Timbobaloo: I read it as it depends on who you cast it on
[0:27:47] Chaseton: Read the next choice talent, they don't rotate. They're random
[0:27:50] zachl_: HOLY clairvoyance
[0:27:52] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd . o O ( drohgoh )
[0:27:52] zachl_: wtf
[0:27:52] Nitruos: lmao
[0:27:53] dimsy__: is this outlaw rogue HUHH
[0:27:56] Nitruos: get ur textbooks out
[0:27:59] Nitruos: we're researching wtf this means
[0:28:02] Greannan: Random and it can give you the same twice in a row
[0:28:05] Celestial990: Prayge lord jesus help me understand english
[0:28:14] Pyrrha_GG: i think it will be role/spec based
[0:28:16] Nitruos: so if you pi a magic user then a healer
[0:28:16] Pyrrha_GG: of the target
[0:28:17] Chewbaccaw: Exam this friday guys please study
[0:28:18] noblausk: I like your funny words magic church man
[0:28:19] wanik90: i think its who you cast it on
[0:28:24] nalegi07: ITS NOT RANDOM
[0:28:30] Greannan: I still have no idea how it works
[0:28:30] gwenmh: it‚Äôs not random it works like twisted fate w in league
[0:28:30] Nitruos: i think based on the person picked it gives you magic/phys dmg or if a healer mana
[0:28:31] theredbellpepper: it probably depends on target/circumstances
[0:28:34] Nitruos: and if on a tank dr
[0:28:35] Nitruos: idk
[0:28:40] Bjornsen95: WHY DO YOU THINK ITS RANDOM
[0:28:49] Nitruos: bc it says it gives one of 3 things
[0:28:50] tvilk: theres no shot they make it fully rng
[0:28:59] Oracle_WoW: i read it as you cast which version of premonition that you want
[0:29:00] zefztra: IQD spell?
[0:29:07] gwenmh: you press the button and it cycles through the buffs in order one per second
[0:29:08] nalegi07: twisted fate cards in League
[0:29:09] tvilk: we're missing context but no shot its full rng
[0:29:10] Nitruos: you PI a warrior it does physical and haste
[0:29:10] theredbellpepper: "gives you advantage against your fate" -> if the target is dying, gives healing, otherwise gives damage idk
[0:29:10] Bjornsen95: U cast on a non healer, its haste
[0:29:15] Bjornsen95: you cast on a healer its mana
[0:29:18] Greannan: Theres no way they prunned Disc literally not a year ago
[0:29:18] jeroome___: just seems like its based on the target
[0:29:21] Oracle_WoW: aand each of the 3 can proc either haste or mana
[0:29:21] Greannan: and give them 5 more spells
[0:29:22] SCMSV: This is either: 1) Random 2) 5 Different buttons lmao 3) Automatically changes based on target cast
[0:29:25] nalegi07: RAGEY
[0:29:41] Aboknes: lol
[0:29:41] PurpleKami: Chat making assumptions
[0:29:44] SurfSalsa: D:
[0:29:45] popularviber: wouldn't it just give the appropriate buff to them? Otherwise the phys/magic buff would do nothing if it does the wrong one
[0:29:47] Chewbaccaw: D:
[0:29:47] Nitruos: the last talent choice makes it even more clown fiesta
[0:29:49] stormshadowx5: It probably is IQD
[0:29:50] Nitruos: read the capstone
[0:29:52] noblausk: my uncle works for blizz that's how i know
[0:29:52] pseudobudo: D:
[0:29:54] Bjornsen95: Oh we def not know, we just chatting
[0:30:05] Oracle_WoW: well yeah, everyone is assuming. thats kinda the point
[0:30:06] durcu: it sounded not random from a lilttle of the taliesin interview i saw
[0:30:12] Kryt96: maybe the 2 are in addition to the first 3
[0:30:12] aimbim: Choice node on the top maybe?
[0:30:12] Camelbak21: Probably ROLE dependent
[0:30:16] Chewbaccaw: whats jak think about this, he posted a wowhead article saying holy priest should be given attonment
[0:30:20] Timbobaloo: 1 tank 2 caster 3 melee versatile is random proc is how I took it
[0:30:23] tvilk: I refuse to believe its RNG, there's no way they are that stupid
[0:30:24] popularviber: non healer?
[0:30:29] Greannan: Maybe it has a chance to give the second one, but always give the first one
[0:30:31] Pyrrha_GG: 5 buff cycle pog
[0:30:38] blaylock2: @tvilk hold my beer
[0:30:45] Greannan: You get insight and CAN trigger haste maybe ?
[0:30:46] theredbellpepper: insight for arcane mage YEP
[0:30:47] zachl_: WAIT
[0:30:51] zachl_: is it spec dependant?
[0:30:52] Kryt96: i read it like you get 1 of the first 3 with a chance for the other 2.
[0:30:53] Nitruos: arcane mage luls
[0:30:55] zachl_: isnt this holy and disc
[0:30:57] totalecl1pse_: for resto druid are we running toxic pants w/ decay patch or verdant tether with lariat?
[0:30:58] ChefXu: Taliesin interviewed the developer for this tree
[0:30:59] Nitruos: capstone even more of a fukin fiesta
[0:30:59] friendshapedsd: There's an interview video with the devs by Taliesin that probably answers all of this
[0:31:08] Chaseton: It's either gotta be random or based on the spec you cast it on
[0:31:12] dimsy__: KEKW
[0:31:12] Camelbak21: AUG PRIEST
[0:31:14] Nitruos: all 5 baby
[0:31:19] Camelbak21: DELETE
[0:31:19] dimsy__: delete aug priest Prayge
[0:31:21] zachl_: cant wait to main priest in the war within
[0:31:23] zachl_: so pog
[0:31:23] MikeyA1256: low chance to be a god
[0:31:25] Nitruos: aug priest baby
[0:31:25] Bjornsen95: Outlaw priest Pog
[0:31:26] Greannan: Tank : Heal taken + chance to get haste Heal : Spell dmg + chance at mana DPS : Either damage + chance at haste ?
[0:31:27] tvilk: will priest become the new outlaw rogue?
[0:31:28] zefztra: high roll spell to win!
[0:31:30] Greannan: Maybe ?
[0:31:33] Chewbaccaw: delete church man
[0:31:34] zolal3: support priest xdd
[0:31:36] Chewbaccaw: send them to hell
[0:31:37] theredbellpepper: Huge RNG Pog
[0:31:41] Celestial990: Fuck the scalies, aug church man is in LOGIN
[0:31:43] nalegi07: proc button to press
[0:31:44] PurpleKami: I fucking hate when they say low chance instead of a number or percentage
[0:31:48] Nitruos: remember every premonition is cast on you and the target as well, so you will always be getting this
[0:31:51] Nitruos: with the double pi talent
[0:31:52] zachl_: @PurpleKami so true
[0:31:53] Narien: I think Clairvoyance just modifies your next cast of Premonition
[0:31:58] tvilk: will priest become the new outlaw rogue? @yumytv
[0:31:59] zachl_: ^
[0:31:59] dimsy__: this is trash YEP
[0:32:12] The_Potatochip: so replacing 2 min pi with rng 1 min buff that can give mana to your warrior at worst?
[0:32:13] durcu: check taliesin interview at 10:03
[0:32:17] durcu: dev explaisn it
[0:32:22] Nitruos: ^
[0:32:34] Pyrrha_GG: maybe it gives you some way to choose which one, but doesnt seem like we know for sure
[0:32:35] Camelbak21: At the bottom of the post I think
[0:32:35] blaylock2: guess im going to have to check the interview then
[0:32:39] zachl_: im curious to hear this dev explain how tf this gonna work
[0:32:41] Nitruos: priest one is wild though
[0:32:46] zachl_: i swear this is too confusing
[0:32:51] Chewbaccaw: bro if i looked up any wow content on youtube my algo gets fucked
[0:32:59] Vyndrodis: did you catch that the one and only real Nony is streaming?
[0:33:05] tvilk: if you need an interview to explain how a spell works, you did a bad fucking job designing it
[0:33:14] Nitruos: lmfao
[0:33:14] Celestial990: HUH
[0:33:16] Pyrrha_GG: so its blessing of seasons
[0:33:22] Aboknes: HUHBibi

[0:33:36] Celestial990: It cycles every second??
[0:33:39] Chewbaccaw: this guy plays league
[0:33:39] menzlo: It's spinning like Mario party

[0:33:47] dimsy__: WTF
[0:33:47] Bjornsen95: so you press it and it cycles fast, then you press again to get what you want

[0:34:17] blaylock2: if it's one, then the other then the other one will do the other, but not before the other gets done doing what the other one once did .   see?  its clear now
[0:34:18] Greannan: Like the spell you see on your bar rotates every spell you cast
[0:34:18] Chewbaccaw: play it slower @yumytv
[0:34:20] Nitruos: every spell just has a chance to change it
[0:34:20] zachl_: this is already dogshit
[0:34:23] tvilk: @yumytv its like that trinket from Neltharus, Spoils KEKW
[0:34:23] Chewbaccaw: 0.75 speed
[0:34:24] Chewbaccaw: please
[0:34:27] Nitruos: LOOL
[0:34:27] Chewbaccaw: PLAY IT SLOWER
[0:34:27] dimsy__: WTF  Û†ÄÄ
[0:34:29] menzlo: Dude
[0:34:29] Nitruos: slower
[0:34:29] QQGamers: track all the things
[0:34:29] jakethesnake117: its ust cycle through the three and u recast it to pick @yumytv
[0:34:31] guynormally: it's like the first time chatter said a few minutes ago. It's like twisted fate W in league. You press the spell once, and then if you press it again within 1s you get the first option, 2s the second option, 3s the third and so on
[0:34:34] Pyrrha_GG: need a transcript kekw
[0:34:34] MrFreezy16: So like picking TF card in league I think, not quite blessing of seasons
[0:34:37] Chewbaccaw: IN SLOW MO THIS TIME
[0:34:37] Celestial990: WTF i gotta go back for a PHD to understand this
[0:34:38] Nitruos: A spell
[0:34:39] SCMSV: KEKW
[0:34:39] maddy02_: isnt that THAT MAKES NO SENSE NO
[0:34:39] jeroome___: A SPELL
[0:34:42] jeroome___: NOT THE SPELL
[0:34:42] menzlo: It starts spinning
[0:34:43] zachl_: AHHAHAHHAHAH
[0:34:45] Chewbaccaw: CLOSE CAPTIONS ON
[0:34:45] Pyrrha_GG: Subtitles
[0:34:45] Nitruos: any spell
[0:34:46] Kryt96: might have to press it 2 times
[0:34:50] Nitruos: it just randomly swaps
[0:34:52] ohfoeshow: yes u press it twice
[0:34:53] Nitruos: the pi
[0:34:54] MikeyA1256: sounds like 2 presses
[0:34:54] t4pekid: dude is this math class what the fuck
[0:34:58] PurpleKami: His statement is literally oxymoronic
[0:34:58] majestictaco0: When you cast Premonition, it starts cycling
[0:35:05] tvilk: @zachl_ yo we switching off priest then? xdd
[0:35:06] imjebb: wtf did i just come in here too
[0:35:06] ohfoeshow: once to activate the randomness..then second to choose ur buff
[0:35:07] xBladesong: You cast the spell > start the rotation > cast it again to lock in your choice
[0:35:12] blaylock2: like lance armstrong ?
[0:35:13] zachl_: it randomly swaps like spoils @yumytv you dont have to premonition to get a new buff
[0:35:15] hmmsicle: @yumytv we‚Äôre ready for keys
[0:35:16] uniqueusername7: when you first cast it it starts the ball rolling, then you have the rotating choice.  its twisted fates 3 coloured cards from LoL
[0:35:16] zachl_: your spells will reset it
[0:35:20] guynormally: hopefully this isn't on the gcd
[0:35:22] MierkaBlue: Every second? for real?
[0:35:23] Solaster: first cast is random. then it starts switching which spell every second. whichever is active when you press next is the one you get
[0:35:26] dimsy__: xddDespair
[0:35:27] Nitruos: you press it to activate the swaps
[0:35:30] ohfoeshow: ie worst case scenario u press once..wait 2 seconds later..press again
[0:35:31] gwenmh: it‚Äôs off gcd
[0:35:31] MikeyA1256: click once to start the cycle. then again to choose
[0:35:31] Nitruos: you press other spells
[0:35:35] Nitruos: until u get the one u want
[0:35:37] Nitruos: then you use it
[0:35:38] imjebb: oh support priest Aware
[0:35:39] popularviber: you cast it once, it cycles, cast it again when it lands on wat you want
[0:35:39] Kryt96: So first press it starts at random like 3, 1, 2 and you can recast to choose what you want
[0:35:42] The_Potatochip: so you cast and then have to wait like 3 sec for haste xdd
[0:35:43] maddy02_: WIDEHUHH
[0:35:43] MasterKEX: yea like TF from league
[0:35:45] zachl_: @tvilk im so tired of druid bro. im swapping off so fuckin fast once i get cozy title io
[0:35:45] treavorthenusance: burn it quickly
[0:35:47] MikeyA1256: slot machine
[0:35:50] helloitskyle: it sounds like it rotates through them in a set order
[0:35:51] commandpostkyle: they made summer worse somehow
[0:35:51] ConchubarOD: that still does not seem fun
[0:35:53] t4pekid: im quitting wow
[0:35:55] tvilk: @zachl_ xdd
[0:35:55] maddy02_: ?????????????????????????????????
[0:35:55] Chewbaccaw: GAMBA IN MY WARCRAFT BatChest
[0:35:56] zachl_: i cant wait to play listerlean. @tvilk
[0:36:01] MierkaBlue: that just seems really unfun?
[0:36:02] zachl_: i fuckin hate druid
[0:36:04] Nitruos: i thin its an improvement on blessings
[0:36:06] cucumbertoessniffa: yumy go here and click on the "pick a card" button https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/twisted-fate/
[0:36:06] zolal3: Madgi where is my haste???
[0:36:06] tvilk: @zachl_ wtf is listerlean
[0:36:10] Nitruos: bc you can at least swap it
[0:36:15] Tarithal: @zachl_ is boon in the tree
[0:36:17] zachl_: @tvilk the priest i got famous on Gladge
[0:36:18] PurpleKami: lmfao the silence
[0:36:22] theredbellpepper: in theory it's much better than seasons because you can pick, but I can just imagine infinite misclicks
[0:36:24] zachl_: @Tarithal No Madge
[0:36:25] Nitruos: growl is processing
[0:36:25] uniqueusername7: people will just make macros that only cast the one you actually want and then you will just hammer it and the rotation will never matter.  then they will remove it after macros solve it already
[0:36:27] maddy02_: i dont get it
[0:36:29] tvilk: @zachl_ youre famous? WIDEHUHH
[0:36:29] alison_hell: just wait for the wowhead guide that explains it, like the rest of us do Kappa
[0:36:30] uniqueusername7: !remind me 12 months
[0:36:32] ohfoeshow: ok now lets doom
[0:36:39] Solaster: growl's brain stunlocked :)
[0:36:45] MierkaBlue: @theredbellpepper if it is every second it sounds soo bloody reactive that.. I dunno
[0:36:50] zachl_: @tvilk i used to be : ( washed now but lean in s4 SL was doin world firsts and somehow got io with ambition
[0:36:51] 1111111111112233: @tvilk bro everyone knows zachi get with the times
[0:36:53] yourfavoritegorf: highJAM
[0:36:54] Chewbaccaw: growl install league and play twisted fate to understand this mechanic
[0:36:54] zachl_: now im just a washed healer
[0:36:55] imjebb: hes cooking something HEAINTCOOKINGSHIT
[0:36:58] Bjornsen95: Pete is cooking, hold on now
[0:36:59] blaylock2: this is how aneurisms happen
[0:37:02] treavorthenusance: aug should be crucified for the sins it's brought upon the game
[0:37:02] yourfavoritegorf: Yo
[0:37:05] nalegi07: KEKL
[0:37:08] maddy02_: ICANT
[0:37:10] Anubitzs: WutFace
[0:37:12] Nitruos: you press it, it starts cycling
[0:37:13] zolal3: xddPeat
[0:37:14] cucumbertoessniffa: yumy go here https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/twisted-fate/ and click the pick a card button
[0:37:17] gwenmh: Lol

[0:37:19] cucumbertoessniffa: oh
[0:37:21] cucumbertoessniffa: you were muted hehe
[0:37:28] Nitruos: its better than blessing
[0:37:30] Nitruos: they allow control
[0:37:35] Nitruos: but you will have to spam some spells to move it
[0:37:37] t4pekid: i loved how we always said wow is too cpmplicated and needs to get simplified, now im sitting here doing math tasks for my priest spec
[0:37:41] theredbellpepper: wowhead article is out @yumytv
[0:37:41] uniqueusername7: exciting combination of randomness is gonna be a new meme
[0:37:41] ohfoeshow: seems to avoid button bloat
[0:37:43] jeroome___: so picking the 2 additional buffs are trolling
[0:37:46] ohfoeshow: seems fine to me
[0:37:46] Chewbaccaw: who let Pare cook
[0:37:48] jeroome___: if you miss
[0:37:49] MikeyA1256: dont miss the right one lol
[0:37:56] gwenmh: also twin moons will always give you the magic dmg buff
[0:38:00] treavorthenusance: the number one thing we hate in wow is randomness when it comes to output wtf kinda hearthstone shit is this
[0:38:07] Kryt96: its a bit annoying having to wait for it, just give us 4 more buttons xd
[0:38:07] tvilk: @yumytv okay so if I need to cast the phys dmg one, but I get bad rng, I could wait several seconds before I get to cast the one I need to cast.. Meaning I'm inting the group cus the warrior already popped cds
[0:38:14] Nitruos: KEK
[0:38:15] 1111111111112233: yeah as someone said literaly twisted fate W from league but its fucking trash and annoying in wow
[0:38:17] dknamey: xdd
[0:38:21] ohfoeshow: if u miss u wasted 2 seconds to wait to see the buff again
[0:38:21] blaylock2: it should say meh just push me
[0:38:21] imjebb: yikers
[0:38:27] Nitruos: its fae guardians, i have to understand it but my fukin dps dont care
[0:38:35] tvilk: 3 minutes xdd
[0:38:40] Nitruos: yeah
[0:38:47] ConchubarOD: it could be 5 secons @yumytv if you have the other 2 options talented?
[0:38:48] nalegi07: or just get assigned that buff so prep for it
[0:38:51] Nitruos: get the !comment ready
[0:38:51] uniqueusername7: "healer couldnt cast a heal because he was waiting for his PI to rotate"
[0:38:52] Nitruos: for it
[0:38:55] Chewbaccaw: tooltips have been shit since the launch of wow
[0:38:55] zachl_: this is just a worse fae
[0:38:56] majestictaco0: nah this shit burnt
[0:38:58] ChefXu: good luck trying to sync with a dps  CDs lol
[0:38:59] Nitruos: if it cycles EVERY spell its really fine
[0:39:00] Lottinius: druid talents seem boring
[0:39:02] MierkaBlue: I mean these new talents kinda... seems like something gimmicky that would have been better for S4 :P
[0:39:04] Nitruos: you max press 2 spells
[0:39:06] kondelol: xdd
[0:39:09] zachl_: theyre so close to cooking but its just the worst fuckin design ever
[0:39:10] PurpleKami: Reminds me of Astro in ff14
[0:39:12] ChefXu: "sorry bad proc have to wait 15 secs"
[0:39:12] MrFreezy16: Wouldn't the mana one be nuts for raid? 5% mana to a healer every 50-60 seconds?
[0:39:16] tvilk: imagine you get Solace > insight > solace > insight > solace > and THEN you get glory
[0:39:17] Celestial990: yumytvFine kitchen pov
[0:39:20] tvilk: and you warrior is dead now
[0:39:24] gwenmh: I main ast in FFXIV this ain‚Äôt that hard
[0:39:27] Nitruos: they said it was cyclical cycling right
[0:39:30] Nitruos: like its ordered
[0:39:30] theredbellpepper: @MrFreezy16 half the healers don't even care about mana anyway
[0:39:33] Chewbaccaw: bro ff14 as a game is not hard
[0:39:36] imjebb: let him cook HEAINTCOOKINGSHIT
[0:39:37] jeroome___: rotates in order
[0:39:37] zachl_: @tvilk solace insight solace insight solace insight solace insight then u get glory
[0:39:42] ConchubarOD: @tvilk he at least said the order is fixed, just the place in the order you start is random
[0:39:43] commandpostkyle: randomness does not seem good
[0:39:44] The_Potatochip: only the first is random
[0:39:45] Chewbaccaw: im not gonna let you cook!
[0:39:49] Kryt96: i dont see the point of having 10% magic and another for physical, just put them on the same spell.
[0:39:56] smuggamer1337: NOTED
[0:40:00] Drohgoh: the expel harm absorb is op
[0:40:02] zachl_: kryt makes a goo point
[0:40:03] Drohgoh: and nobody uses it
[0:40:04] uniqueusername7: @yumytv it would be saved if it was the other way around, you select the buff first then cast it later.  but then youve just got warrior CDs from classic which they removed because it was dumb
[0:40:04] zachl_: why isnt it just
[0:40:08] zachl_: 20% damage and 1 spell
[0:40:10] zachl_: instead of
[0:40:13] zachl_: 20% of each magic
[0:40:15] zachl_: and 2
[0:40:18] uniqueusername7: its 10%
[0:40:29] Nitruos: its so complicated for a new player
[0:40:33] Nitruos: imagine explaining this to a new player
[0:40:34] tvilk: @tvilk @ConchubarOD yeah okay thats better, but since there's 5 of them you could end up having to wait 5 seconds to get the one you want thats a slow af reaction time if you want to time it with other CDs
[0:40:34] zachl_: u get the point @uniqueusername7
[0:40:45] uniqueusername7: no Madge
[0:40:48] ConchubarOD: @tvilk yup, exactly
[0:40:49] Gojoro9: Sir, can you please tell me your thoughts on holy paladin in m+?
[0:40:50] whiskeyhide: Yo
[0:40:52] Nitruos: bc fucking divine image is broken
[0:40:54] tvilk: @zachl_ Nerdge its actually 10%
[0:40:55] Nitruos: and requires 0 thinking
[0:41:03] Lenietwitch: it got used in previous seasons i think
[0:41:12] zachl_: @tvilk ackshually Nerdge
[0:41:20] Wiseved: s1 we played divine word
[0:41:23] t4pekid: anyways did you see the miz and mitch security camera scuffle? SNIFFA
[0:41:24] 1111111111112233: @Gojoro9 its essential in a 5 paladin comp
[0:41:27] Nitruos: the spell effects on the divine word sanctuary are cool too
[0:41:34] Nitruos: the dmg buff is cool
[0:41:37] tvilk: @1111111111112233 not if you play double prot
[0:41:41] Nitruos: just requires thought and not as much throughput sadge

[0:50:59] GooseComics: cool ty for that
[0:51:05] tvilk: I've been so demotivated to play m+ lately PoroSad
[0:51:11] Thowarr: Nox's stream: https://www.twitch.tv/noxivv
[0:51:24] zachl_: @tvilk im so motivated bro i can + 1 every key this week and just not push the rest of the season
[0:51:31] zachl_: thank the lord
[0:51:35] daevyfan: offer him more
[0:51:36] TheYeetusLord: I'm liking the new vuhdo layout!
[0:51:38] imjebb: Sadge
[0:51:40] tvilk: @zachl_ sounds like you're not playing pugs xdd
[0:51:59] Bjornsen95: Wait, you have like no crit
[0:52:00] zachl_: @tvilk i actually have been pugging a few keys but i do for 90% of the time play with a team ye
[0:52:23] tvilk: @zachl_ i have pugged all this season on both healer and tank and i'm miserable
[0:52:54] zachl_: no one wants healers this season cause healers marry tanks and dont play with other people
[0:52:57] Thowarr: @tvilk I've pugged on two toons as dps; same
[0:53:07] akeelian: ayayaxdd vs xddPeat
[0:53:26] manlyhandles: big key LETS GO peat
[0:53:27] zachl_: i mean yeah u gotta do it i just never remember it being this bad
[0:53:31] tvilk: @Thowarr bro I wish I was playing DPS.. except I don't. Pugging DPS you spend 30 min to start a key and then deplete in 5min
[0:53:32] Galois_rg: @zachl_ this is my experience too
[0:53:43] imjebb: i need my tank peepoCute
[0:53:54] zachl_: galois ur owning this season right
[0:53:54] Thowarr: @tvilk you were in my DHT this morning, weren't you :P
[0:54:17] 1111111111112233: @tvilk you can always do your own key  to speed it up
[0:54:21] Galois_rg: I'm almost 3700 by pugging alone
[0:54:22] akeelian: o7
[0:54:24] Galois_rg: I can't find a fucking group
[0:54:25] tvilk: @Thowarr i havent played last 5 days cus im fucking demotivated
[0:54:26] IAttackYou: I think all of the non tank chars kinda leech on to tanks
[0:54:32] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd
[0:54:32] zachl_: @Galois_rg ????
[0:54:34] zachl_: are u eu
[0:54:34] tvilk: @1111111111112233 nah no one joins dps keys
[0:54:37] Galois_rg: NA
[0:54:45] zachl_: 3700, from pugging?
[0:54:50] Galois_rg: ye
[0:55:02] zachl_: im like 3580 Cryge with a team Cryge
[0:55:07] Hyvest: yo gamers
[0:55:09] Thowarr: @tvilk Same; I think I spent 20 mins last night trying to get into a key, and just said F it.
[0:55:12] zachl_: bro there are no NA pugs
[0:55:13] tvilk: im 3200 pugging @zachl_
[0:55:15] zachl_: how tf do u find them
[0:55:19] Galois_rg: every group already has a healer and only use me for homework keys
[0:55:22] Lottinius: aaa
[0:55:22] Daamian94: i just hit 3300 pugging as prot pally today EZ
[0:55:23] Hyvest: Seems like you didn't get cancelled for being a meat enjoyer?
[0:55:36] zachl_: @Galois_rg YEP
[0:55:40] t4pekid: need that raider io of the 3700 pug
[0:55:46] tvilk: @Thowarr yeah thats why i switched away from DPS this season.. But I just don't like playing tank and healer. But I'd rather hate playing the game than not at all
[0:55:46] 1111111111112233: @tvilk i beg to differ i put my 26 AD key instantly got a premade today the tank got eaten by rezzan on the first cast and everyone left without saying a word but they did join a dps key
[0:55:51] Galois_rg: look at Qdl, that's me
[0:55:52] t4pekid: links or impossible
[0:56:00] tvilk: @1111111111112233 xdd
[0:56:23] Thowarr: @tvilk 3210 and 3192; Hit the same wall with both toons and I basically accepted where I am
[0:56:26] Galois_rg: https://raider.io/characters/us/area-52/Qdl pretty sure this is gonna get me timed out
[0:56:37] Galois_rg: oh links are allowed, nice
[0:56:41] zachl_: nah links allowed
[0:56:46] zachl_: also how tf are u pugging 30 brh
[0:56:47] Blloood: rip key
[0:56:52] zachl_: i never see a key like that in lfg
[0:56:56] maddy02_: @zachl_ i did pug that
[0:57:00] imjebb: no 7 min yalnu this week widepeepoHappy
[0:57:07] zachl_: maddy ur good and eu Madge hush
[0:57:09] t4pekid: @Galois_rg  EZ Clap
[0:57:13] Thowarr: @tvilk For me, I'm old (45+ club), and I don't have the mental space to deal with tanking. Haven't healed in 20 years, not about to start :P
[0:57:13] maddy02_: wtf
[0:57:14] theredbellpepper: @Galois_rg rio description checks out
[0:57:15] tvilk: @Thowarr understandable, but is that cus of you or are you stuck with uncordinated pugs
[0:57:19] zolal3: @Galois_rg you pug with discord or what
[0:57:32] Galois_rg: yeah, I still use discord
[0:57:36] Galois_rg: a couple of my top keys are no comms though
[0:57:53] zachl_: we all know u can pug a 30 brh maddy Madge us NA healer bois cant even find a 30 brh in q anywhere
[0:57:54] zachl_: gg
[0:57:56] tvilk: @Galois_rg prove it, change the raiderio description to "zach is L"
[0:58:04] zachl_: Madge
[0:58:06] Zlywiarz: I appreciate catman not doing mdi so that he can costream while he gambles instead
[0:58:18] Galois_rg: lol, I am not going to bend over backwards to prove things to twitch chat
[0:58:32] tvilk: MadgeBackhand
[0:58:34] Marenjok: afternoon gamer
[0:58:36] 1111111111112233: @Galois_rg bend over Gayge
[0:58:38] Thowarr: @tvilk I'll take some of the blame, I'm sure there's things I'm messing up, but it's also the nature of most pugs. The DHT I mentioned after first bear, the bear tucked into the corner on the right? It was pulled twice. First time we wiped. Tank tried to do it safer, nope
[0:58:43] Galois_rg: you can see me listed in LFG right now looking for a group
[0:59:02] tvilk: @Thowarr ohhh yeah, had that happen in a 24 last week too.. i tilt
[0:59:21] Ï¥àÏΩúÎ¶øÎãàÌÇ§: is this a wa for the mob spells being cast?
[0:59:53] tvilk: WIDEDUCKASS zack what is this? HUHH
[1:00:23] Galois_rg: the bear does stream, he isn't right now though
[1:00:27] ChilledPenguinn: holy Deadge
[1:00:34] MicHawkh: Deadge
[1:00:39] Kinali: :33 Arrive
[1:00:42] tvilk: is dorki doing mdi ?
[1:00:43] Galois_rg: "it's still okay" COPIUM
[1:00:52] Daamian94: @tvilk practicing atm
[1:00:56] Thowarr: the bear is back in purgatory MDI practice hell
[1:00:57] Daamian94: time trials
[1:01:23] Lottinius: i got tyrstone from the vault for my shitterdruid FeelsOkayMan
[1:01:46] leubinator: @yumytv would you rather have very gameplay impacting hero talents that change how u play or do u like generic ones that just buff existing playstyles more
[1:01:48] Daamian94: how they are suppose to react to that jump?
[1:01:50] Daamian94: its 1 shot
[1:01:52] t4pekid: shouldve brought r druid
[1:01:55] Kinali: RIP
[1:02:00] tigglers: no shot they made pi worse
[1:02:19] tigglers: wait maybe not
[1:02:22] TzHyperNova: just wondering you using yu'lon whisper?
[1:02:34] Hyvest: also fuck all the healer support stuff
[1:02:36] Hyvest: or pet stuff
[1:02:49] TzHyperNova: I feel like it's a fun talent
[1:02:51] imjebb: HOLY BASED
[1:02:54] yumytv: !bars
[1:02:54] Nightbot: The colored enemy cast bars on right come from this weakaura: https://wago.io/kT4e-_NDA
[1:02:57] imjebb: no zen pulse gamer
[1:02:57] leubinator: i would rather have generic ones that don't feel bad to change between with balance changes
[1:03:00] Galois_rg: zen pulse is giga for healing on big fort trash packs though
[1:03:17] maddy02_: zen puilse does so much dmg for me tho
[1:03:18] Galois_rg: play zen pulse
[1:03:22] Galois_rg: it does giga healing
[1:03:24] Galois_rg: on big pulls
[1:03:28] TzHyperNova: revival
[1:03:38] maddy02_: @Galois_rg healing? does damage you mean
[1:03:44] imjebb: @Galois_rg but. but... peatSpin
[1:03:50] Thowarr: 321GO
[1:04:14] wildheittv: Junkrat never wasting meta again with growl lol
[1:04:25] tvilk: !sck growl can u please enable this sick wa
[1:04:25] Nightbot: DO NOT USE THIS WEAKAURA https://wago.io/PTAc84Jp-
[1:04:37] hivplus__: Deadge
[1:04:42] Hyvest: what was your title again yesterday? xdd
[1:04:56] Galois_rg: fort brew at the start of that pull every time, just as insurance
[1:06:01] So_0bvious: what happened to the 30
[1:06:18] zeta_cs2: @yumytv wouldnt it be better for you to stay out of the fights and have higher chances of living? or do the 80k dps matter that much?
[1:06:22] manlyhandles: EZ
[1:06:23] Thowarr: @So_0bvious "Well you see, what had happened was..."
[1:06:29] So_0bvious: lol
[1:06:31] t4pekid: xdd
[1:06:46] Kinali: They are just THAT good EZdodge
[1:06:48] maddy02_: @So_0bvious SO BASICALLY they misplayed some mechanics in the dungeon and that killed the players in the group which depleted the timed event they had to absolve to get in game rating
[1:07:21] Hyvest: yapping
[1:07:30] theredbellpepper: @zeta_cs2 mistweaver damage = healing
[1:07:41] So_0bvious: @zeta_cs2 afaik mw gets easy aoe healing off of aoe dmg
[1:07:45] maddy02_: @zeta_cs2 OMEGALUL
[1:07:49] zeta_cs2: @theredbellpepper ah ok, then nvm
[1:08:30] battleskaar: mw seems so easy on all trash
[1:09:02] maddy02_: @battleskaar it doesnt seem like it, it is!
[1:09:07] Galois_rg: mw is omega payphone on trash, kinda difficult on certain tyran boss fights though
[1:09:17] Marenjok: the jammers volume kinda low
[1:09:33] zolal3: @Galois_rg single boss aoe heal you mean?
[1:12:03] azabejusz: is the jadefire stomp like faeline stomp used to be? I mained MW for years but quit a year ago :)
[1:12:28] ottomr1990: it is faeline just with a non-SL animation
[1:12:28] tvilk: catJAM
[1:12:28] Nightbot: catJAM
[1:12:29] vexvextv: dude is expel harm a hack
[1:12:44] azabejusz: @ottomr1990 Thank you!
[1:12:59] Galois_rg: it delays, yeah
[1:13:09] Marenjok: catJAM
[1:13:09] Nightbot: catJAM
[1:13:13] vellocets: it heals for a lot
[1:13:14] Galois_rg: on big enough pulls, it'll heal squish for like half his health or more
[1:13:16] vellocets: when a lot of dudes are nearby
[1:13:16] Athierian: does it?
[1:13:20] theredbellpepper: there was quite a bit of dooming about expel harm / healing elixir, turned out pretty well imo
[1:13:21] Athierian: maybe i should use it morel ol
[1:13:24] imjebb: its like half or quarter second after use
[1:13:26] fox5523: Is the mini cocoon from using TF tea with expel harm any good?
[1:13:26] Athierian: feel like it does fuck al
[1:13:35] snarky03: Zen is kinda not consistant
[1:13:44] Galois_rg: @fox5523 it's giga if you need to live oneshots
[1:13:57] Thowarr: Death Recap: u ded
[1:14:07] fox5523: @Galois_rg that's dope
[1:14:13] t4pekid: ????
[1:14:15] simplepathwow: Deadge
[1:14:23] t4pekid: Terrorist
[1:14:25] discomancer1: growl's "about yumytv" section is finally correct again. He's playing high m+ player with a brave bear
[1:14:27] Thowarr: @yumytv u know what you said to that dryad
[1:14:56] imjebb: @discomancer1 but not HIS brave bear peepoSad
[1:15:05] theredbellpepper: you call the creatures in the dungeon "trash" and expect them to just let you be?
[1:15:19] discomancer1: @discomancer1 true
[1:15:29] Galois_rg: yo is there some vday hack? yoda's group is in SFK before their WCM key right now
[1:16:16] imjebb: when you get a fat zen pulse it feels cracked
[1:18:05] TzHyperNova: with chi-ji you can walk in the roots frelly
[1:18:12] TzHyperNova: freely*
[1:18:52] Galois_rg: dude is addicted to sck, pressing it on single target
[1:19:07] Galois_rg: lol
[1:20:02] Hyvest: whenever I see Sheilun's I question lay on hands' existence
[1:20:15] Notey__: @Galois_rg you might as well if you have the energy, you can still cast while channel
[1:20:20] theredbellpepper: you have to cast it and it's on the gcd
[1:20:20] Hyvest: MONKA
[1:20:29] MierkaBlue: how did you live that?
[1:20:47] autumnbugle: frame perfect roll
[1:20:57] Galois_rg: @Galois_rg might as well do 10% of the dmg you could be doing to the boss, yeah makes sense
[1:21:12] MierkaBlue: yeah that was some server tick -tech right there
[1:21:46] xdiede1010: yummy if all i do is pug as restro druid, now that im starting to do 25s should keep the cat kick or just try and take stay alive talents
[1:21:52] Hyvest: @theredbellpepper It's still 40 seconds on 5 targets vs. 7 minutes on one
[1:22:08] dimsy__: pog
[1:22:57] theredbellpepper: @theredbellpepper well it doesn't ALWAYS heal fully at least

[1:26:12] JarRulez: Did you switch off vuhdo? Or just change the look a bit?
[1:26:30] ConchubarOD: its still vuhdo
[1:26:40] JarRulez: ty
[1:27:17] battleskaar: thisll be spicy with all melee
[1:27:21] flockheart: hiii growl and chat
[1:27:33] Hyvest: yo flock
[1:28:11] JarRulez: Got it, i thought you mentioned trying Cell the other day so i was curious.
[1:29:17] imjebb: 15 second cooldown on a button that just healed half your health. mw is sick
[1:30:21] artstyl333: !vuhdo
[1:30:21] Nightbot: I use Vuhdo for frames, you can find my exports here: https://linktr.ee/yumytv (warning: vuhdo sucks if you aren't good with addons)
[1:30:21] Galois_rg: how long was that boss?
[1:30:50] Galois_rg: yeah that's real fast
[1:31:00] kaan2k420x: is shadow priest any good in keys
[1:31:08] or3g: yes
[1:31:29] or3g: lots of viable specs rn, its nice.
[1:31:39] yungbooma: monkaW
[1:31:42] surtakscythe: what do the P and M on your screen with numbers stand for?
[1:31:46] BigTrout3: monkaW
[1:31:51] autumnbugle: like toast?
[1:31:51] imjebb: uh oh peepoRun
[1:31:54] yungbooma: burnt toast?
[1:31:56] MasterKEX: monkaW
[1:32:13] Chewbaccaw: monkaW
[1:32:15] PepikStep: Yeah dude, makes total sense. Not burning but burn smell
[1:32:18] Thowarr: Pete def havin' a stroke
[1:32:32] Galois_rg: yo there is some kind of vday hack, yoda took some kind of buff into that WCM 31
[1:32:35] imjebb: sounds bout right
[1:32:36] lanta404: chiefs???
[1:32:39] Chewbaccaw: you ever participate in grillin' season? @yumytv
[1:32:41] Marenjok: idk about kc but in springfield its 60 lmao
[1:32:54] kaan2k420x: I m new to the game kinda get a hold on to shadow but is evoker any easier what do you guys reccomend
[1:32:55] Chewbaccaw: wtf
[1:32:58] IAmSolari: grilled salmon and potatoes?
[1:33:23] IAmSolari: yeah you can get a vers buff from the valentines day event or something
[1:33:24] commandpostkyle: Sus
[1:33:29] Galois_rg: ok yeah the buff is gone now, but it was there before they died
[1:33:30] flockheart: KEKW
[1:33:33] skix0: auh
[1:33:34] flockheart: where's the feet
[1:33:54] dknamey: world buff Pog
[1:33:57] burne114: chat have we looked at new hero talents that were just announced?
[1:34:10] BigTrout3: @kaan2k420x devastation is very simple and competitive. augmentation is easy to do but hard really excell with having to track other players' cooldowns
[1:34:10] or3g: @kaan2k420x it will take as much time to learn evoker as it has to get where you are on spriest. just play what you like and as you get better youll learn what you have to do to make your spec work at a higher level, what kind of hurdles you have to jump through etc
[1:34:31] nyshindysheen: new hero?
[1:34:33] BigTrout3: also, play what you want. you'll have more fun jpcL
[1:34:58] uniqueusername7: if you optimize the fun out of the game you will just quit and it wont matter
[1:35:00] BigTrout3: this is the way
[1:35:12] kaan2k420x: kk thanks bro
[1:35:17] flockheart: what if the spec i picked doesnt get invited
[1:35:29] oMSQo: Why is no one doing +32?
[1:35:31] or3g: push your own keys, find a group of friends etc
[1:35:39] Scarooo34: @oMSQo bunch of noobs
[1:36:16] bkl_zirial: Greetings, how do you let the GCD show on your WA? Haven't found a way to do so.
[1:36:57] popularviber: @bkl_zirial if you're talking about the bars in the middle those are action bars, but with weakauras it's under the trigger -> cooldown -> extra options
[1:37:12] surtakscythe: or maybe all the spells on the wa are off gcd
[1:37:17] BigTrout3: @bkl_zirial under extra options of a "Spell > Cooldown" check "Show Global Cooldown"
[1:37:25] bkl_zirial: @popularviber Ah, thanks. I'll try that.
[1:37:27] BigTrout3: under triggers
[1:38:08] BigTrout3: I've gotten so sick of making WAs for cooldowns, I've decided to just use action bars
[1:39:22] bkl_zirial: And yes, I meant the Icons in the middle of the screen. I assumed they are a WA. I made myself one as well but just couldn't get them to show the GCD as in the one from Growl ^.^

[1:46:20] Galois_rg: the pulls blizz intended, 1 mob at a time
[1:46:24] Ryok: yo i'm confused how raid vault slots work... do you have to kill the boss you want loot of that week or is a permanent unlock once you killed it once? like can i just kill up to smolderon and get fyrakk stuff if i killed him before?
[1:46:29] BigTrout3: xdd
[1:46:36] flockheart: yes
[1:46:36] snarky03: @ghantous You get into combat before placing statue

[2:57:46] ShadowDuelist21: panda GIGACHAD
[2:58:09] tvilk: i thought all the big gamers were playing on 1080p for better frames
[2:58:26] DreadfuryDK: Oh god oh no Growl's gonna be targeted by the P3 one LMAOOOOO
[2:59:14] DreadfuryDK: He was not, in fact, targeted by the P3 one. Saved
[2:59:36] n0s0upbr0: these guys are absolutely BLASTING
[2:59:37] n0s0upbr0: this key
[3:00:00] tvilk: accidentally hit CTRL S ICANT
[3:00:00] n0s0upbr0: this is disgusting
[3:00:11] DreadfuryDK: @n0s0upbr0 This is a subtle reference to the fact that any key that has Noobadin in it automatically blasts 500% harder than any key that does not have Noobadin in it.
[3:00:18] DreadfuryDK: Sometimes even harder.
[3:00:23] n0s0upbr0: noobadin diff ?
[3:00:24] noldan216: I was wondering if the sound cutting was a doordash-fingers problem
[3:00:29] Aimboater: 29 fort bosses are like 27 tyran, childs play bros
[3:00:35] n0s0upbr0: I‚Äôm fucking so bricked up watching this key
[3:00:41] n0s0upbr0: like drake bricked uo
[3:00:42] n0s0upbr0: up
[3:00:49] lapendinha: yo is the end of PI in next exp with those hero talents?
[3:00:49] SiIentShade: i wonder if we'll ever see the immersive SCK WA in play again
[3:01:14] tvilk: @lapendinha they are literally buffing pi
[3:01:16] DreadfuryDK: @Aimboater Except when you have Noobadin in your group. When you have Noobadin in your group 29 Fort bosses are like 19 Tyran bosses (and the 19 Tyran bosses are like a 21 or something)
[3:01:19] Ryok: hmm... raiderio dead for anyone else? D:
[3:01:47] KDaily: I have bursting PTSD
[3:01:54] KDaily: seeing that pull gets me anxious
[3:02:02] n0s0upbr0: @dreadfurydk noobadin might be the goat
[3:02:08] BigTrout3: SpinningCatKick
[3:02:12] n0s0upbr0: i mean these guys are are not making any mistakes
[3:02:15] n0s0upbr0: this is disgusting
[3:02:19] n0s0upbr0: NO
[3:02:30] tvilk: built different
[3:02:31] Harthad: jynxed it
[3:02:34] tvilk: @Ryok not for me
[3:02:41] DreadfuryDK: You wouldn't have had bursting PTSD if Noobadin was in your group, because the only bursting going on is Noobadin's empowered Consecrate doing about as much damage to each mob as a 10-stack of Bursting.
[3:03:02] Ryok: @tvilk weird... it tries to load the page for a good minute for me and then gives me an error saying the page isn't safe
[3:03:06] n0s0upbr0: dreadfudy do u have a line of@communication with this noobadin freak tank
[3:03:12] n0s0upbr0: tel him soup is bricked upppp
[3:03:20] DreadfuryDK: @n0s0upbr0 He's literally in my guild LMAO
[3:03:26] MierkaBlue: gettingjiggywithit
[3:03:28] n0s0upbr0: lmfao
[3:03:30] tvilk: @Ryok a specific one or main page?
[3:03:33] ShadowDuelist21: gettingjiggywithit
[3:03:40] n0s0upbr0: what‚Äôs ur in game name I know some peeps in that guild
[3:04:01] Ryok: @tvilk a specific one... through the ingame addon link D: maybe i'll try the main page
[3:04:03] PrincessPuffyPants: @Ryok The EU version seems to be down.. Me 2
[3:04:11] DreadfuryDK: @n0s0upbr0 Dreadtendies LOL
[3:04:22] n0s0upbr0: hmm
[3:04:24] n0s0upbr0: dk?
[3:04:29] Ryok: @tvilk weirdly enough the main page instantly loaded D:
[3:04:30] DreadfuryDK: Used to be. Priest now.
[3:04:32] tvilk: @Ryok oh i dont think you should post the ingame link into the search bar, you just open raider.io and then CTRL V on the page anywhere and it will figure it out itself
[3:04:33] n0s0upbr0: wait ur name says dk
[3:04:48] Kernirino: god i hate the new faeline visual
[3:04:48] n0s0upbr0: alright this is scary
[3:04:56] n0s0upbr0: the new fae line visual is absolute garbage
[3:05:04] Ryok: @tvilk i see... thanks ^^
[3:05:13] ConchubarOD: @n0s0upbr0 gib glyphs for old visuals
[3:05:54] ssj_lenin: damn maybe its time to switch to night elf
[3:06:05] n0s0upbr0: nightelf is cracked
[3:06:07] tvilk: @ssj_lenin shadowmeld is goated this season
[3:06:20] n0s0upbr0: why Billy sitting on images
[3:06:26] n0s0upbr0: making prodigy be a prodigy
[3:06:41] tvilk: @n0s0upbr0 saving it for the eruption
[3:06:59] n0s0upbr0: which one is that he‚Äôs had it up for both soaks
[3:07:12] tvilk: he wants to save it in case he's the one targeted
[3:07:17] JackOfAllApocalypses: that's a big ass bird
[3:07:19] n0s0upbr0: he got invis
[3:07:20] n0s0upbr0: he‚Äôs safe
[3:07:28] tvilk: i dont know man
[3:07:37] n0s0upbr0: me either
[3:07:47] tvilk: maybe he forgor, he clearly didnt need it anyway
[3:08:02] KDaily: can you change the appearance of the vuhdo overshield bar?
[3:08:04] tvilk: 31 atal Prayge
[3:08:07] ssj_lenin: quick 2 chest the 29 lmfao
[3:08:10] n0s0upbr0: YUP
[3:08:11] n0s0upbr0: I SAID IT
[3:08:14] offbrandgrill: someone in here called it x)
[3:08:16] n0s0upbr0: 31 ADDDDD
[3:08:19] ShadowDuelist21: 31 atal Prayge
[3:08:23] SurfSalsa: Pog
[3:08:25] n0s0upbr0: SOUP KNOWS ALL BROTHER
[3:08:27] n0s0upbr0: INSIDER SOUP
[3:08:31] bazefacee: I have a 31 rise I'm pretty sure it's bricked
[3:08:32] DreadfuryDK: Noobadin doesn't have to switch to Night Elf. This is partially because he physically cannot, switch to Night Elf, but even if he COULD the mobs would simply target him with certain abilities, realize their mistake, and profusely apologize to Noobadin and harmlessly cancel their casts without retargeting.
[3:08:35] bazefacee: and not timeable
[3:08:45] tvilk: @DreadfuryDK ESSAYING
[3:09:04] n0s0upbr0: 31 ATAL NO DEATH RUN ?
[3:09:12] n0s0upbr0: PRODIGY LOBS U HE DOESNT GET LOBBED
[3:09:13] misterworldhide: 31 atal no out of combat run
[3:09:14] tvilk: growl can u turn up the music for stream only
[3:09:21] n0s0upbr0: PRODIGY LOBS U
[3:09:23] tvilk: also I heard you almost play "A lot" by 21 savage there
[3:09:23] KDaily: can you show overall damage?
[3:09:27] n0s0upbr0: HE DONT GET LOBBED
[3:09:28] tvilk: zach isnt here you can play 21
[3:09:44] t4pekid: i think you need to play some 21 for that key
[3:09:46] aelysqt: i thought it was me i heard it too lol
[3:09:54] tvilk: you know me growl i know music
[3:10:08] KDaily: where rageheart?
[3:10:53] t4pekid: or you might throw on some circo loco from drake and 21 for this key
[3:10:56] DreadfuryDK: Noobadin doesn't need a Rageheart though, for there is zero rage in his heart. Though I do believe he has one, since that was our first drop.
[3:11:00] tvilk: play 21 before zach comes home from school ayayaxdd
[3:11:02] tvilk: xdd
[3:12:20] KDaily: paladin confessor
[3:12:20] tvilk: xdd wtf
[3:12:39] tvilk: xdd who kicks the dispel then?
[3:13:03] DreadfuryDK: 32 EB? Easy homework key LOL
[3:13:05] imjebb: big luck
[3:13:05] kitty0chi: you can do it
[3:13:15] Lumimyrsky: 32 EB? D:
[3:13:18] nilIie: thats like a 5 eb sesh HOLY
[3:13:32] t4pekid: 32 EB for Vod Commentary
[3:13:38] lapissuu: 32 EB Despairge
[3:13:42] remtried: can you show nats damage break down quick?
[3:13:52] tvilk: growl on HC how do I know which pack of mobs I split pull with mind soothe and which I can't?
[3:14:00] misterworldhide: gotta send the 32 EB to beat yoda to world first 32
[3:14:09] Lumimyrsky: You should probably get something to drink and eat, you're gonna sit there for a while.
[3:14:11] Omyslash0: 40% haste??? jeeeeeewilikers
[3:14:31] DreadfuryDK: You have Noobadin in your group. His very presence makes the mobs so intimidated that they reduce their HP and damage output to the far more reasonable levels of a 28 Everbloom.
[3:14:36] tvilk: There was a pack in Wetlands around a campfire, 4 mobs, and I was able to pull only 2 of them using mind soothe on the 2 others
[3:14:41] tisiwonz: what is the weakaura that does a exclimation point and does a WHIZZIng noise when targeted cant seem to find again @yumytv
[3:14:42] chalupascript: o7 growl
[3:14:43] tvilk: maybe coincidence

[3:15:28] tvilk: idk could just be coincidence that it happened for me cus i also never heard of it before
[3:15:50] marcofellipe69: gods know gods
[3:15:54] DreadfuryDK: Noobadin has no favorite dungeons, for he loves all his children equally.
[3:15:58] tvilk: but then again usually all mobs standing around a campfire gets pulled if u pull 1, no?
[3:15:59] tisiwonz: !civcheck
[3:15:59] Nightbot: tisiwonz is 94% civilian.
[3:16:05] imjebb: you ever play any metal gear?
[3:16:05] tisiwonz: oof

[3:23:42] tvilk: @naieisawful theres been like 3 weeks of m+ hell in a row, i imagine a lot of people have kinda stopped playing
[3:23:46] zachl_: i am sherd Gladge i got a 95 on my exam for business analytics EZ
[3:23:54] zachl_: i forgot sherd was an emote
[3:24:08] tvilk: @zachl_ Nerdge BUZINEZ
[3:24:15] naieisawful: @tvilk last week was of (apart from tyrannical shannenigans) and this week seems ok
[3:24:21] shred403: What happened with the other 5%
[3:24:28] Gojoro9: hmm, your SUF and details link on your UI youtube video dont work. Says i cant access the justpastit website?
[3:24:29] shred403: Lol jk good work dude
[3:24:45] zachl_: @shred403 professor wont let me see until monday : /
[3:24:57] tvilk: @naieisawful last week was the easy week of the 3 hell weeks
[3:25:25] naieisawful: ye i mean, im a ranged dps so i dont suffer with the ghosts much
[3:25:37] tvilk: nah this week is easy
[3:25:44] Gojoro9: Sir, do you have your details, SUF, and omnicd profiles anywhere? The links on the youtube video dont work
[3:25:58] naieisawful: but its been awfully slow, like i barely managed to get 1 group together since reset
[3:26:02] tvilk: but seeing as people might be demotivated to play since we just had omega hell, it makes sense to see a drop in players last couple of weeks
[3:26:23] tvilk: also nearing end of season people kinda just stop pushing
[3:26:36] naieisawful: i def need some m+ frends, but my class isnt much of a M+ class
[3:26:49] tvilk: dont we all
[3:27:01] DanteDemonZ: @naieisawful my class is M+ class but everyone asks me to play the meta spec and not my spec :c

[3:28:30] n0s0upbr0: yazma is a pussy
[3:28:32] Thestolenname11: Why does he have 2 damage done trackers? lol
[3:28:50] tvilk: @naieisawful i would but im so depressed now i dont wanna play the game anymore im thinking of calling it quits on pushing io
[3:28:53] ottomr1990: sometimes you just switch one and forget
[3:29:04] naieisawful: @tvilk ooh cmon its fun
[3:29:06] n0s0upbr0: @tvilk that‚Äôs what I did it‚Äôs depressing
[3:29:19] Shadostealer: @naieisawful i mean any class tbh can do high keys tbh
[3:29:40] Zitrux: @yumytv Could you set overall damage on one details window? :)
[3:29:48] marcofellipe69: EZ win
[3:29:50] marcofellipe69: on god
[3:30:00] naieisawful: @Shadostealer can do yes, but get invites, not really
[3:30:02] marcofellipe69: if I had this key I'd say play safe
[3:30:09] Gojoro9: Sir, do you have your details, SUF, and omnicd profiles anywhere? The links on the youtube video dont work
[3:30:26] tvilk: @naieisawful its fun yes, but its not fun to spend 20min of hell with a group of dps who don't know how to kick or use stuns in a +25
[3:30:37] zachl_: wait to ask after the key if u ask 3 times an no reply @Gojoro9
[3:30:53] Gojoro9: ok my bad
[3:30:53] Shadostealer: unironically people 100 io lower then me think i will be the reason a key depleates
[3:31:01] tvilk: ye he a little busy rn

[3:34:52] Meridian_Ent: yeah its dogshit
[3:34:58] BigTrout3: @tvilk true. I can't understand why players want to hardcast spells
[3:35:02] n0s0upbr0: been dog shit all season people were just sweating it so hard
[3:35:07] imjebb: vulpera buff* xdd
[3:35:28] Meridian_Ent: whenevner i play wow again im being a prot pally main soup
[3:35:30] Chewbaccaw: @n0s0upbr0 read automaticjaks wowhead holy priest retrospective article
[3:35:30] tvilk: @BigTrout3 I have a hard issue playing casually on caster dps cus at that point shit dies too fast, but if you're playing melee its fun cus you're just chaining shit while moving
[3:35:35] Meridian_Ent: giving up on the brewmaster dream. its just trolling
[3:35:52] n0s0upbr0: do it bro prot paladin is getting season 1 tier set next season which is totally meta
[3:35:53] zachl_: @BigTrout3 because people did nothing but heal all the way up until bfa and oldhead healers are like "why do i have to do damage" or "why am i dead"
[3:35:59] Chewbaccaw: https://www.wowhead.com/news/a-look-back-at-holy-priest-in-dragonflight-and-war-within-wishlist-editorial-337541

[3:36:44] BigTrout3: @tvilk so true. so frustrating missing a tag cause you couldn't instant cast a spell
[3:36:45] n0s0upbr0: @meridian_ent I‚Äôm maining holy priest next season i got mine to 3400 been learning

[3:38:36] Meridian_Ent: just make it fun bro thats all that matters in m+

[3:39:11] zachl_: @Meridian_Ent encrypted was the best affix this game will ever see and its not even close
[3:39:20] natethenoob1234: @Meridian_Ent 100%

[3:40:22] noewon: HEALERS GoodTake
[3:40:25] tvilk: @zachl_ huh? Awakened did the portal thing, encrypted just had extra mob with buffs
[3:40:33] Antillarea: healers are NonVerbal
[3:40:36] n0s0upbr0: no that was shrouded wasn‚Äôt it
[3:40:37] zachl_: @zachl_ do you even remember what wo did
[3:40:40] sagamariia: encrypted was fun beacuse you werent really punished for 'failing'
[3:40:54] tvilk: @zachl_ Wo did the CDR I think
[3:41:07] Zitrux: WTF? Did that mage just change build from fire to arcane for last boss?
[3:41:10] zachl_: it literally did exactly what awakended did, then gave u 2 other options of buffs, then was 2x as frequent or 3 as awakened
[3:41:11] n0s0upbr0: encrypted was not the dreadlords was it ?
[3:41:12] natethenoob1234: ur did cdr and wo did invis and movement speed
[3:41:21] zachl_: @tvilk yeah wo was invis
[3:41:23] ottomr1990: no the joke is wo was the mass invis that let you skip whatever you wanted in the dungeon. aka awakened

[3:43:04] n0s0upbr0: @meridian_ent is better than all of you probably
[3:43:04] zachl_: i cant speak for pugs but for high end m+ this game will never witness something as great as encrypted
[3:43:07] n0s0upbr0: so show some respect

[3:54:09] BigTrout3: what the fuck is a quarter note Shruge
[3:54:18] ArufiedTV: do we get the new talent trees in the pre xpac patch?

[3:54:24] marcofellipe69: sounds like u need google Shruge
[3:54:26] ArufiedTV: the .7 patch?
[3:54:40] Mynester: SCATTER
[3:54:47] tvilk: @ArufiedTV probably, but we dont have any points to spend
[3:55:01] tvilk: or rather it will be on the prepatch
[3:55:09] tvilk: so like 2-4 weeks before release
[3:55:22] imjebb: HOLY fat io for prodigy if this is timed
[3:55:23] natethenoob1234: we gotta get alpha news first kekw
[3:55:24] ArufiedTV: @tvilk pre-patch, that was I meant. I totally blanked on what it was called haha
[3:55:58] harmless52: billy says no, it must be true
[3:55:59] n0s0upbr0: brother u just no deathed it on 29
[3:56:01] n0s0upbr0: u got this
[3:56:03] nightbreeze93: ANY BELIEVERS
[3:56:07] zamow1994: billy knows
[3:56:10] tvilk: @ArufiedTV historically they introduce these kinds of things in the prepatch so you have a few weeks to learn your "new" setup and shit, but in terms of talents you can see them but not get them cus you get points when you level up and you can't

[4:07:41] hobit0213: is that a wa or a plater mod that warns you when you have been targeted by a spiteful shade?
[4:07:42] thaylondc: @Haneget you need mouseover macro
[4:07:49] nightbreeze93: well prodigy would be only monk to time it
[4:07:52] marcofellipe69: 1 tapped
[4:08:12] nvpal: F
[4:08:22] BigTrout3: @hobit0213 likely both. plater has a mod to highlight the nameplate of the shade targeting you
[4:08:53] Zitrux: Does everyone need to have that dispel WA?
[4:08:57] kitty0chi: i believe
[4:09:32] hobit0213: i have the plater mod but not sure how you get the sound notification. quite handy to know if you're targeted
[4:10:36] kitty0chi: nice
[4:10:42] Vangi: repair AINTNOWAY
