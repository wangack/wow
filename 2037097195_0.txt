[0:20:11] Eonx: queued dpm up to 3k mmr last week and didn't lose to any warpal at that rating
[0:20:13] Tacooenn: cata just as pve dependent as wrath ?
[0:20:24] Eonx: then queued yesterday and scubad down to 2750
[0:20:31] Eonx: losing almost all warpal
[0:20:31] Aspmann: Cata beta should start relatively soon according to the blizzard road map right?
[0:20:33] Eonx: kekw
[0:21:08] Bucket_AU: Cata was the xpac I played the most. I don't understand the hype for it? Has the nostalgia not worn off yet?
[0:21:37] Xoq_twitch: Beautiful the "1"
[0:21:37] Rivahlol: i’d say warpala is favored for sure yea
[0:21:37] Pinkusfloyd: resto druid will be better in cata?
[0:21:39] Xoq_twitch: <3
[0:21:42] Rivahlol: but it’s winable
[0:21:49] Aspmann: @Bucket_AU There is pretty much no hype for it. You see enough people dunking on it
[0:22:05] Kalaspinglan: did you get the bauble yesterday?
[0:22:18] Kalaspinglan: sadge :(
[0:22:19] Eonx: DPM is the ultimate 'everything is winnable' comp which makes it fun, just typically odds are not in your favor
[0:22:32] Kalaspinglan: prebuy for 1mill?!
[0:22:34] Bucket_AU: It was my first xpac queueing arena and it was the most fun time I've had playing the game but I can't say I'm excited to do it again
[0:22:35] Eonx: although disc + dk feels rough this season as it's hard to actually oom a priest
[0:22:46] obahtwerk: hi pojke, could I ask you how is ret pala during cata and pandaria? in pvp
[0:22:46] auntstone: resto Druid is gonna be troll spec in cata
[0:22:50] BakkaTV: you're gonna miss wrath right..
[0:23:37] Rivahlol: i’m gonna make a mage again???
[0:23:43] BakkaTV: LSD2 w chan and me on healer ? :)
[0:23:45] NurfMe206: What is ur native language
[0:23:46] Pinkusfloyd: resto shaman will be good
[0:23:50] Bucket_AU: Cata 3s is a lot more fun than wrath 3s from my memory. Other than triple dps. Is that right?
[0:23:51] auntstone: pojke #1 mage you didn’t know?
[0:24:33] Rivahlol: rivahResist
[0:24:35] Pinkusfloyd: maybe you can play feral in cata :D
[0:24:48] nfs65: will cata release with 4.3.4 patch notes?

[0:25:05] professor_of_math_harvard: wow why did you get perma banned :/
[0:25:09] Eonx: if i remember right Cata 2s were pretty damp if you weren't playing double dps
[0:25:20] Eonx: hopefully 3s is more active
[0:25:28] Bucket_AU: feral disc 2s in cata is op
[0:25:34] kaptenapa: the first two raid tiers are banger aswell in cata
[0:26:21] NurfMe206: Do you prefer the old school method of rank 1 (singular top team in the bracket/region) or the current method
[0:26:29] DrMcIngo: isnt there even legit triple dps comps for 3s
[0:26:33] onduqeee: What the heck, is Acc sharing prohibited for all purposes? Or just boosting?
[0:26:36] Pinkusfloyd: 8sec skull bash interupt and feral can cyclone in feral form its so op
[0:26:52] Eonx: skull bash gives increased mana cost as well
[0:26:56] Eonx: just press on CD who cares
[0:27:01] Eonx: oom the healer
[0:27:05] ravine77: I played the highest fire hpala in eu in s11 and you could never lose.. either win or draw :x
[0:27:08] NurfMe206: yeah i remember tichondrious bracket was the hardest one
[0:27:19] NurfMe206: "bg9"
[0:27:21] auntstone: @eonx you can’t oom healer when he dies in 1 min
[0:27:26] rayzerpls: i think they should put damp in cata 2s for sure
[0:27:36] Lzmage: is clone in cat form cata?
[0:27:38] Eonx: @auntstone min5HEAD
[0:28:05] auntstone: did they put dump in wrath?

[2:41:07] notmorbos: theres always ways, you can just pay someone outside of Russia in crypto or smth and have him buy it on your account
[2:41:08] kuvve: the west and its fetish for sanctions of any kind is just ridiculous and sick really
[2:41:15] notmorbos: but ofc it will kill a big part of the russian playerbase
[2:42:03] tiotum: @kuvve Huh? Its sick that russia is getting sanctioned for invading and starting a war?
[2:42:04] tiotum: like what
[2:42:07] Purvy: @kuvve I mean, its hardly unjustified this time with Russia invading another country now is it :D Can't expect to do things and have no consequences
[2:42:25] kuvve: going by that logic, we should all sanction america all the time...
[2:42:33] kuvve: and innocent americans aswell
[2:42:52] notmorbos: also "the west" is interesting, just see how china treats countries who deal with taiwan
[2:42:56] ktp_blue: as with any conflict in the world, conflating the citizens with the government who is perpetrating...
[2:43:03] notmorbos: this is not exclusive to any region or faction worldwide
[2:43:16] Unfeatured: politics in chat Pog

[2:46:23] shucoco: Btw i just realized you played with pretty much all the big warriors in the game. Rasel, torsten, pvelrd, shinta. Only missin qwneer Kappa
[2:46:26] Purvy: @Zevx I think its due to sanctions that America places on USA/EU based companies to do business with Russia
[2:46:31] kuvve: its probably just desperation, the west and EU have noticed that the sanctions arent working so theyre just grasping for straws now
[2:46:42] shizophrenla: @Cdenzy what was the max raiting back then ?
[2:46:44] Bloodx: 1445 resi, 3200, 20%
[2:46:47] ktp_blue: i wonder if they are still trying to find a partner in china. losing that market was surely a huge loss...and now losing russia seems like a big deal
[2:46:52] kuvve: theyre probably gonna sanction air from Russia soon

[6:12:27] Adindan01: i played back in furious and i think the extra sp and dmg feels better now
[6:12:49] Soumi: I mean he isnt wrong soumiSmile
[6:12:53] devzyx: WIN HERE POJKE
[6:12:59] breakyax: big true
[6:13:05] Soumi: what can warriors do without hpala
[6:13:11] Soumi: nothing soumiSmile
[6:13:18] Azmoddan: @Soumi feet up is max FeelsOkayMan
[6:13:29] breakyax: if sm was so good why arent there a bunch of wd/wdp LUL
[6:14:09] Soumi: ye but they are broken because of paladins enabling them
[6:14:21] breakyax: warr disc priest
[6:14:24] Soumi: put a disc or druid there and war in wheelchair or disc/druid dead on opener
[6:14:35] deebizness_: warriors are broken in the right hands....but the average warrior is meh
[6:14:47] Makcie321: ahh yeah i reckon soumi is right warr is pretty bad
[6:14:55] Makcie321: im sure only the best of the best can make it work
[6:15:01] Soumi: war isnt bad
[6:15:08] Soumi: war would be bad without hpala
[6:15:15] breakyax: ye they should make spell reflect global
[6:15:20] breakyax: or atleast add shockwave to arms
[6:15:44] Cdx71: pojke just casually buying 18k mount KEKW
[6:15:44] Moobot: playlist !socialmedias !photosynthesis !covenant !legendaries !conduits !stats !discord !macros !ui !specs !restodruid !awc !armory
[6:15:52] Makcie321: warr and pala best classes
[6:15:55] Cdx71: i remember how 18k was a fuck ton back in the dya
[6:16:00] Exessive23: mortal strike should apply -50% spell power as overpower into cast
[6:16:06] Exessive23: and -50% healing ofc
[6:16:16] Soumi: @Makcie321 together ye
[6:16:17] Makcie321: almost like if u group up with tier 1 class as another tier 1 class your comp is good
[6:16:19] breakyax: mortal should just silence
[6:16:24] Soumi: well pala is best even if war doesnt exist
[6:16:25] breakyax: for 6 sec
[6:16:31] Soumi: but war needs pala
[6:17:14] mathematician3: @Soumi if you delete warrior, what is something that can beat LSD?
[6:17:28] Soumi: lsp would be best comp overall
[6:17:45] mathematician3: Yes but in a matchup LSD > LSP ?
[6:17:50] Makcie321: rather face endless amount of lsp
[6:17:52] Soumi: not sure in s8
[6:17:53] Makcie321: than any warr
[6:17:56] Soumi: s8 lsp prolly wins lsd
[6:18:09] breakyax: s8 almost all wizards beat lsd
[6:18:20] breakyax: mls, scleave, shatter
[6:18:24] breakyax: all can beat it
[6:18:44] Soumi: too bursty damage with cts/dfo
[6:18:48] Soumi: druid has no mitigation
[6:19:51] breakyax: ye u just globalize whatever isnt fully hotted

[6:35:33] mathematician3: cata waiting room
[6:35:37] NoManele: @rnger HC killed it actually
[6:36:42] mathematician3: Splitting the playerbase to 4 different versions of classic didn't help
[6:37:01] NoManele: @mathematician3 true
[6:37:16] Apocalypsyss: Sure, but Pojke is right, Wrath is over-rated.
[6:37:42] Ripleyxz: @mathematician3 actually thats true
[6:37:55] NoManele: @Apocalypsyss isn't it the only expansion still played on private servers tho?
