[2:29:18] Steppenwolf28: I ain't never said no to trisag ngl
[2:29:29] MelfinaStarwind: we did the courthouse thing
[2:29:32] JohnnyGreyHS: What about eloping?
[2:29:33] Overpathos: How many subs for a marriage? LuvSign
[2:29:37] JohnnysHappyHideout: @JohnnyGreyHS GIGACHAD viewer
[2:29:37] IVEBEENSHOT: got married in 2018, can cofiirm 20k
[2:29:38] Gristenn: My wedding was 150 ppl and only got 3k
[2:29:43] Vilivus: I'm glad I didn't have a big wedding, but it was still a hit to the wallet to feed people
[2:29:47] Steppenwolf28: Pretty = powerful change my mind
[2:29:56] Argonon_02: Why didn t take trisagon?
[2:29:58] JohnnyGreyHS: @JohnnysHappyHideout I've been a part of a lot of Cobalt's Twitch history. It's a long one
[2:29:59] Gristenn: cost 3k
[2:30:06] shirtless96: I got a life insurance pay out right after I got engaged so I didn't really have to worry about money for it
[2:30:06] Steppenwolf28: Advice: Think positive :) My brain: "Negative negative negative negative"
[2:30:10] JohnnyGreyHS: Always been happy to be part of Cobalt's community
[2:30:14] mrbreaddaddy: 120 people we were around 16-17k?
[2:30:14] sad_potato_cat: but why didnt you take trisagon? Kappa
[2:30:20] Gawri10: i took all the money we had and bought an apartment instead of paying for a wedding that noone needs
[2:30:21] Kitkitten_: @JohnnyGreyHS  cobaltHug
[2:30:25] Argonon_02: Oh i didnt know that low dmg
[2:30:40] Steppenwolf28: Yes :)

[2:30:42] GAlexPR: My whole wedding was about 1k. Pog
[2:30:44] Kings_Ex: you think bible is better than guppys head?
[2:30:45] The_Dapper_Chap: 33% I think
[2:30:51] Kings_Ex: i guess faster kills
[2:30:57] shirtless96: I think each tick does less but it doesn't lower the stat maybe?
[2:31:03] Overpathos: I played less tboi flash and this tboi than having watched you play it, ironic OMEGALUL
[2:31:20] JohnnysHappyHideout: @JohnnyGreyHS I think I started watching him while it was still Justin TV, but I didn't always keep up, got busy with school and stuff.
[2:31:21] blucynder: Wow cannot believe he didn't take trisagion, no confidence in his own abilities
[2:31:37] notsketched: trisag doesnt have a stat multiplier anymore i dont think
[2:31:37] sad_potato_cat: I think tris actually lowers damage by 66% no? I thought it only hits for 33%
[2:31:51] Overpathos: Nah i don't care, i always love lurking or actively participate in your channel man bleedPurple
[2:31:52] notsketched: the trisag beams just do 33% of your damage, they dont touch the stat
[2:31:53] JohnnyGreyHS: With only Trisagion, Isaac with base stats will deal about 18 damage per second on an unmoving, gaper-sized enemy. 1.32 shot speed will reduce DPS to about 14.
[2:31:53] uwuphoria: i watch more of you in one month and i have hours on steam for this game KEKW
[2:31:57] JohnnysHappyHideout: @JohnnyGreyHS And I am a certified lurker.

[2:32:06] uwuphoria: and i have like 300 hours on steam KEKW
[2:32:33] JohnnyGreyHS: @JohnnysHappyHideout Dang son. Well, we've come full circle with Twitch back to what was Justin TV days don't you think?
[2:32:34] shirtless96: Looked it up, each tick of dmg does 33% of your dmg but it doesn't lower the stat
[2:32:42] maranon: cobaltHi cobaltHi
[2:32:43] andrehunter1: @sad_potato_cat "Blasts deal 33% of the regular tear damage, but can hit the same enemy multiple times." From the wiki
[2:33:09] JohnnyGreyHS: I didn't realize that Trisagion was a 66% damage down @CobaltStreak
[2:33:17] JohnnysHappyHideout: @JohnnyGreyHS Somewhat, yeah, I can agree with that.
[2:33:21] Overpathos: "i'm going to work son" "what's your work dad" "throwing tears at weird fleshy abominations son" LUL
[2:33:21] Kitkitten_: @maranon  cobaltHi
[2:33:24] omegamango_: OH HI COBURT

[2:33:35] JohnnyGreyHS: Effects      Tears are replaced with piercing white blasts of light.         Blasts deal 33% of the regular tear damage, but can hit the same enemy multiple times.
