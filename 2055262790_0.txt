[1:10:27] PurpleKami: bro Im so sick of tindral one shotting the raid cause of your least performant 3 or 4 peeps
[1:10:36] staranemone: @maaskyy hehehehee
[1:10:46] Syzmical: blaze lines + QoL on gripping spirits

[1:10:48] Yagr6: @PurpleKami welcome to wow raiding
[1:11:02] Sover31gn: They were probably waiting for people with capped gear to get stuck
[1:11:07] gregl__: jailer ryg
[1:11:19] MissingLobe: sup chads
[1:11:43] staranemone: max where‚Äôs the puppers?!
[1:11:56] rtee1__: but u had less gear
[1:12:01] MissingLobe: they're the couches
[1:12:02] Dagomarus: gear doesnt solve intended one shot mechanics
[1:12:07] staranemone: hmm
[1:12:13] heffdogga: @staranemone pretty sure three are in the cam
[1:13:01] PurpleKami: @PurpleKami I've gotten CE since Nzoth, this is the worst it's been imo

[1:14:14] kelly_mac06: they datamined + health nerf confirmed by NA
[1:14:19] lapeiris1234: It says unnanounced
[1:14:20] JonBarackSnow: the post mentioned datamining earlier
[1:14:22] kindunos_: maybe
[1:14:23] Lindorn_: just after i think
[1:14:28] JGussey: @Maximum Do you think they will ever get rid of gear Durability? Guild Wars 2 got rid of it and it was such a nice QoL
[1:14:30] staranemone: what wha im lost!!!
[1:14:40] shareandcare: if the spirits have less health now, do they transfer less health to amirdrassil?
[1:15:26] khebul: you have 1:49 to beat the second dream rend. Quite possible, assuming you have the damage to break the sield afterwards
[1:15:34] Swyvle: @JGussey nah cause it's a really good gold sink
[1:15:52] Byggareebob: move everything off the shield move everything of the colossus lust in p2 and and kill before third apoc or right after is our plan

[1:16:57] JayBlaaaze: hotfixes
[1:17:14] Jjmn12: @Byggareebob shield is a flat value not based on his hp no?
[1:17:30] kindunos_: i mean a WA would just handle that mechanic for you if it was that way
[1:17:32] minimi12001: fyrakk nerfs are bigger than this
[1:17:35] kindunos_: wouldnt change gaemplay at all
[1:17:36] minimi12001: they just posted new nerfs
[1:17:44] MissingLobe: looks like there's a few more
[1:17:46] nelis4224: Bluepost is up, 1 corrupted seed got removed
[1:17:51] WyspaTheInsane: Its just annoying.
[1:17:52] kindunos_: you would still dispel off cd
[1:17:53] rhamilt4: pressing dispel is the most anti fun button
[1:17:57] sheckles: healers are known whiners though who cares
[1:17:58] chikeninja: wake ben up now, i want to see his poe stream Madge

[1:18:59] Bryyo: you‚Äôd be surprised how many healers missed that dispell in heroic pugs
[1:19:08] Yagr6: THANK GOD
[1:19:14] fleks27: surprised they didnt break his legs and made it 1 corrupted seed each instead of 2
[1:19:19] fleks27: wait they did
[1:19:21] fleks27: NVM
[1:19:33] Kingstarkz6: mythic splits
[1:19:34] Candysocks: boy i sure do like having to weave dispells into my healing ramp
[1:19:36] minimi12001: huge change
[1:19:38] ogbuckwheats: wayyyyyyyy to long for this to come out
[1:20:03] nemziac: what hall of fame
[1:20:11] minimi12001: especially now that its combined, not alliance or horde
[1:20:14] x_Scy: fleks27 this means if you're bad (like i am), we end with 4 corrupted seeds instead of 8, right?
[1:20:25] Milano___: AQ bug fix LUL
[1:20:27] treesdesu: @fleks27 meow

[1:21:49] Fun_Mo: Why is there a temple of ahnqiraj change KEKW
[1:21:54] nemziac: w/ so much going on its just hard to keep a global free on prog
[1:21:55] Yagr6: is this live today or next reset?
[1:21:57] Roper26: wowhead just posted another fyrakk nerf in addition to this lol
[1:22:07] Byggareebob: any second you remove in p3 makes the boss easier. insta wipes happen at any moment in p3
[1:22:28] TCSTRNG: link for this website
[1:22:29] fleks27: seed nerf is the kneebreaker, bless for that
[1:22:29] minimi12001: ooo for %hp shield
[1:22:38] LuciFeariUm: @Roper26 its not in addition to this, wowhead is just making a second nerf post saying that they also nerfed seeds
[1:22:49] Dolas08: shield is 7% max hp of boss
[1:22:50] moash_: it is smaller, like 10m hp lower
[1:22:51] x_Scy: fleks27 so, you're going to sell fyrakk now? xdd
[1:22:56] Shammedic: @Maximum shield is 7.2% of his health
[1:22:57] khebul: shield is 10 mil smaller in intermission
[1:23:05] fleks27: idk i hope i dont raid
[1:23:19] Infiinii: 53%
[1:23:20] cardclasher1: 70
[1:23:23] owlietm: 53 iirc
[1:23:23] nelis4224: 53
[1:23:37] x_Scy: does that mean no more grip required?
[1:23:42] minimi12001: oh bc they have less hp to siphon to the heart
[1:23:49] LuciFeariUm: for sure to offest the heal from the adds
[1:23:49] katokal: Mark!
[1:23:50] Thdlock: its not since their hp is not the amount they give
[1:23:54] jonpelf: motw not required anymore?
[1:24:12] minimi12001: so not like larry got it
[1:24:15] fleks27: psure 60 instead of 53 just removes 1 grip/rescue
[1:24:16] ryan4: fleks when are you posting another banger tweet
[1:24:24] fleks27: add hp shouldnt matter
[1:25:06] fleks27: we arrived at the backbreaker
[1:25:10] the_bhagwan: OMEGALUL
[1:25:11] aves_tv: if you kill before 4th roar dont you just double drop on 1st
[1:25:19] the_bhagwan: have ur best players solo it
[1:25:20] Hugosuave: do we still lust at the p3?
[1:25:22] aves_tv: n play less seeds all p3
[1:25:23] Teeemosh: doublle pop first green seeds
[1:25:28] jeeesp: Bl p2 after intermission boss dead in p3
[1:25:28] fleks27: now that its less seeds the best part is you do not have to trust melees with handling seeds
[1:25:30] fleks27: insane nerf
[1:25:33] fleks27: xdding
[1:25:33] treesdesu: But my angy seedlings. Sadge
[1:25:37] bug_legacy: the seed change is the biggest nerf
[1:25:37] Byggareebob: @aves_tv yes
[1:25:47] HakiThunderFox: will you stop dps for 30seconds in p1 now?
[1:25:49] the_bhagwan: ya 4 best players
[1:25:49] charef: Flamebound and Shadowbound are no longer private auras.
[1:26:01] Hugosuave: still lust in p3? @Maximum
[1:26:13] Madmaori: t swift nerf when???????
[1:26:21] LuciFeariUm: that was from 1 feb
[1:26:21] shaayynee: that change already happened tho
[1:26:22] minimi12001: that is the same as the hotfix last week, they havent changed cages yet
[1:26:22] Plaza_: thats intermission not cages
[1:26:30] Artheeri: @Madmaori already nerfed into the ground
[1:26:34] Keppie__: Flamebound and shadowbound is intermission
[1:26:42] minimi12001: cages still priv
[1:26:48] LionButLeon: @Madmaori the boss is legit free?
[1:26:55] LuciFeariUm: cages still private
[1:27:06] blacklight_____: cages are still private @Maximum
[1:27:07] LuciFeariUm: just scroll down to amir nerfs from 1 feb
[1:27:10] miketrouts: @Artheeri correct. But the dad guilds progging on it still wipe 400 times xD
[1:27:16] Keppie__: @Maximum Its not cages still private
[1:27:36] the_bhagwan: HARD
[1:27:49] the_bhagwan: just become a symbiote
[1:27:55] Sylvival: that would have been nice if it was like the star augur weakaura :P
[1:28:09] Patrikhg: easier then pre nerfed tindy seeds?
[1:28:32] Lindorn_: ya still dunks you
[1:28:38] Auphius: Yeah you'd probably die lol
[1:28:39] Pilke97: Hey Max whats day today i cant read title
[1:28:58] LuciFeariUm: @Maximum its not cages nerfed just intermission auras. scroll down on blue post
[1:29:02] minimi12001: yea one chatter just cant read
[1:29:08] Lindorn_: LUL
[1:29:10] LuciFeariUm: one guyd
[1:29:22] RSTight: lotta assuming there
[1:29:23] ShaggySummers: I knew that Kappa
[1:29:26] Swyvle: WAYTOODANK
[1:29:27] khebul: I think anything that is private aura cannot have more than 3 people coordinating a mechanic. Anything more is hard to yolo
[1:29:29] PsyKzz: What if they made the partnership move promiment - so you already know who your partner is? Does that just remove the mechanic?
[1:30:48] fleks27: roger predicted this during ptr talks and he is still proud of it
[1:30:51] fleks27: its fucking insane
[1:31:08] fleks27: (i never typed this=
[1:31:29] minimi12001: fleks gkicked for leaking 2 months after race
[1:31:33] Fun_Mo: classic flek leak
[1:31:36] CrerisRs: SLG also had a mechanic that didnt exist in its dungeon journal, so
[1:32:23] SamMFJackson: should make u alternate shadow then fire then shadow ect
[1:32:51] Swyvle: i think he means after you pick up the first one
[1:33:23] Archerone: this is a mega based take
[1:33:30] Treebuckett: Totally agree. Pre assigning the whole raid with 10 of each debuff is pointless
[1:33:32] Madmaori: any ideas on when tswift nerfs will come in? FallCry
[1:33:33] LionButLeon: yeppers
[1:33:34] not_vry: instigating ***
[1:33:37] SamMFJackson: i just ment if they wanted to make it slightly harder make players alternate
[1:33:52] SamMFJackson: not the cringe assignment private aura thing
[1:33:53] moistweaverr: its a bad phase
[1:33:55] moistweaverr: lol
[1:33:56] zuyaaaaaa: it's a story phase
[1:33:59] LionButLeon: OMEGALUL
[1:33:59] logicaltty: KEKW
[1:33:59] moistweaverr: as a healer its a very bad phase
[1:34:01] Gamerhcp: KEKW
[1:34:02] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[1:34:03] miraagex: xdd
[1:34:03] hivplus__: OMEGALUL
[1:34:04] fleks27: sark p2 ü§ù fyrakk p2 when it comes to sucking ass
[1:34:05] Scarrboros: KEKW
[1:34:06] reymargera: KEKW
[1:34:08] voidlock42: KEKW
[1:34:09] Faraday5001: donki
[1:34:09] Brotholomew13: lmao
[1:34:09] Fun_Mo: leave him banned
[1:34:12] Lenzoface: KEKW
[1:34:13] Scoops__: watduheck
[1:34:14] leubinator: donki HAH
[1:34:18] LionButLeon: @fleks27 baseg
[1:34:27] moistweaverr: true
[1:34:30] katokal: @fleks27 Can't wait for fated handshake
[1:34:32] x_Scy: what was sark p2 again
[1:34:35] asd123qwerty1: donki HAH
[1:34:40] Monsuno: that's got big "The Wifi goes off at 9 pm" energy
[1:34:42] Swyvle: Sark p2 is terrible
[1:34:46] Scarrboros: horseboy is a charming individual
[1:34:47] minimi12001: sark p2 was just half of p3 for some reason
[1:35:01] Patrikhg: sylv p2 WutFace
[1:35:06] atamdev: the king of bad p2's though is still sylv
[1:35:07] fleks27: sark p2 is just 3 dungeonpulls and two sets of bombs
[1:35:17] NewTechGuy: NewTechGuy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! ayyy
[1:35:17] x_Scy: oh right, the add shit
[1:35:20] Treebuckett: Max do you know if priest buff on the adds in fyrrak p2 works like druid buff?
[1:35:22] asd123qwerty1: @maximum you can kinda play tindral p1 like sark p1, that made p1 tindral easier for our guild
[1:35:24] shareandcare: do you feel like melees were stronger than average this tier and had easier mechanics than usually? So the best of both worlds?
[1:35:24] Whitewolf1441: yeah i remember scripe talking about how that was bad design for multiple healers to get a mechanic
[1:35:33] miraagex: Fyrakk funny
[1:35:35] Korupcija_: visually ye
[1:35:36] bug_legacy: the problem is that devs focus too much on flavor and not enough on gameplay
[1:35:38] bubblebazook: fyrak p3 feels so good
[1:35:39] zuyaaaaaa: sark p3 was great
[1:35:43] LionButLeon: EPIC BatChest
[1:35:53] noewon: Binoculars that mog is fire
[1:35:58] Rendlaws: sark also being a 7min boss owns
[1:36:00] puneet911: sark p3 was Bedge
[1:36:01] mrduckytom: where is "dead" as an answer for the poll?
[1:36:02] Swyvle: i like the aesthetic of fyrakk encounter more more
[1:36:11] Themselves: every boss after sire had a really shit phase lmao
[1:36:12] BlazinHurricane: Fyrak was a big dragon and sark was a small dragon. Big dragon more epic.
[1:36:16] voidlock42: Fyrakk just bigger GIGACHAD
[1:36:26] Mr_Mittons: @mrduckytom monkaW
[1:36:28] fleks27: sark was too much pissvibe dmg wise, but first tier with crests def made them underestimate what people can do outputwise
[1:36:36] not_vry: ***
[1:36:38] EFFSIN: when will u wear a hat agin
[1:36:58] Themselves: every boss after sire had a really shit phase lmao. wonder when we'll have boss with banger phases whole fight
[1:37:00] x_Scy: @fleks27 i wish crafted items were still max ilvl Sadge
[1:37:05] RurryDiff: new fyrakk nerfs, less seeds in p3 idk if you saw already
[1:37:56] Xanctius: About the same pull count as LFR
[1:38:06] Isarees: 250 pulls here we just got to p3
[1:38:10] TSmarine: This makes p2 a LOT more consistent
[1:38:13] MacSquizzy: MacSquizzy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[1:38:14] MorandoTv: my fyrakk prog is on tindrall still lmaooo
[1:38:15] kindunos_: p2 was majority of our prog
[1:38:16] Yoitsnova: most of prog is weakaura progression and p1 lol
[1:38:17] Taytor: 100 pulls, in i1 rn
[1:38:17] Psyquest: we did 80 pulls just getting to first intermission
[1:38:21] BurtikShaun: recorded kills 116, that cant be right
[1:38:29] Yoitsnova: was*
[1:38:35] Keppie__: So many p1 wipes
[1:38:42] Gryphuk: we had like 150-200 p1 pulls KEKW only ~50 pulls after that for all of intermission and p2
[1:38:43] x_Scy: BurtikShaun he literally just said it's not up2date
[1:38:46] wpprrz: @Isarees so 100 pulls to go
[1:38:52] fleks27: i wonder what wouldve been tighter, fyrakk p3 or unnerfed raz p3
[1:39:03] TheunGaming: Blaze is a pain point, and p2 being consistent is a pain point (we're ~450 wipes in, just missed HoF by 4% last night)
[1:39:49] fleks27: yes
[1:39:50] Patrikhg: @TheunGaming its the no shaman diff Sadge
[1:39:56] fleks27: pre 4% vs pre christmas raz nerf
[1:40:28] bubblebazook: true unnerfed raz you dont even get out of first intermission
[1:40:31] wpprrz: no
[1:40:33] xmonk7: Raz could have been just as epic if they didn't nerf
[1:40:56] fleks27: i think boss with 4% more is hella cooked but i also think raz dmg is also giga cooked
[1:40:57] itsgamz: Boss heals after 5th roar, no?
[1:41:19] Eleemz: Raz p3 not being a dps check felt kinda bad, the room closing in on you is a cool enrage mechanic
[1:41:26] Oracle_WoW: wasnt the phase itself much easier to execute? raz that is
[1:41:39] theDirtyon3: i love tight shit
[1:42:15] fleks27: so by logic
[1:42:21] fleks27: iridikron p3 will end everyone
[1:42:26] Bret36: Hey max, I just got back from LA Wtf is going on with the weather... Is it still raining?

[1:47:57] ShowDUH: There's a post for 10.2.6 saying its in march and you get Season 4 PTR right as it will be out
[1:48:02] smolderdaddyuwu: 04/09/24 will be Alpha. Easy. @Maximum
[1:48:53] reggiepowa: its some low level content prob
[1:48:54] dknamey: basically peopel without dragonslight
[1:48:56] GrafePZL: You dont need to have dragonflight
[1:48:56] nightst314: leveling content?
[1:48:57] Xanctius: No level requirement?
[1:48:57] Oracle_WoW: not if you didnt buy DF though right?
[1:49:00] yrp01: Pre 60 content
[1:49:00] Gamerhcp: you dont need DF
[1:49:01] TheBroCrow: probs accessible to low level players
[1:49:01] miketrouts: hardcore retail
[1:49:02] SavageFromSpace: I think they mean it's gonna be in classic and retail
[1:49:03] Scoops__: HmMmmMm
[1:49:04] fel__666: i think they just trying to get classic ppl in
[1:49:05] Milanesa_De_Pollo: A retail would require the expansion
[1:49:05] smolderdaddyuwu: no matter your IQ you can do it
[1:49:06] fleks27: prolly means you do not have to be max level or have df
[1:49:07] lleguerre: Maybe it's not dragonflight related
[1:49:08] LeoricDidNothingWrong: probably dont need dragonflight for it
[1:49:10] SavageFromSpace: or that I guess ye
[1:49:11] voltare213: maximumToken maximumToken maximumTokenÔøºÔøº maximumToken
[1:49:13] daiger5o: No need to have df

[1:49:31] Whitewolf1441: cant wait
[1:49:39] Squats3: they need to expand this to be a norm. fuck ptr
[1:49:46] xxpurplehazen: this is reddit level fuckery of in-jokes
[1:49:46] Korupcija_: probably a new reputation to grind DIESOFCRINGE
[1:49:54] Zarroe: hidden huh PepeLaugh
[1:49:55] ShowDUH: its just gonna be loaded already
[1:49:56] SavageFromSpace: large encrypted patch
[1:50:07] Squats3: hide story
[1:50:09] babaqboy: mini raid possible?
[1:50:18] Xanctius: Will be great as an EU player watching everything get spoiled on US a day before :)
[1:50:28] reggiepowa: imagine not testing m+, that would be a shtishow
[1:50:30] Pilke97: two boss raid pls
[1:50:32] ColdIceCreamMan: they also mean totally encrypted without being able to datamine
[1:50:46] Guffels: no way they can hide every single dungeon change for M+. just too much content
[1:50:53] Thasin22: so its just a big casual patch
[1:50:59] RockIV: undercover raidleading today?
[1:51:05] zannuss: Been a long time since I've done that
[1:51:06] KaisenSiru: Pog
[1:51:11] Milanesa_De_Pollo: confirmed new class in 10.2.6? PogU
[1:51:13] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Pog
[1:51:15] ColdIceCreamMan: yea, so you US gamers can spoil us everything an wowhead will be flooded with guides the time we get to play
[1:51:16] Yagr6: zero raid testing ever on any boss sure
[1:51:16] Korupcija_: they should only test combat stuff
[1:51:17] Madgeneto: i expect nothing but im already disappointed
[1:51:17] Squats3: @Guffels they would just have to encrypt it. the issue is that there is so much more surrounding it that they just dont do it
[1:51:19] flabstv: imagine it's a new raid
[1:51:25] MONNlBLAST: They couldnt datamine much for sod phase 1
[1:51:27] syst3mctl: Destiny 2 did that with new exotics: log in one day and you got ish to do
[1:51:28] Fuzziew: Na because people will bitch about the community not getting a chance to test it
[1:51:33] GrimmshadoXI: I think you would adjust easily and just enjoy it even more after a bit
[1:51:33] Midnight_Ahri: Pogu Augment is gonna be deleted in 10.2.6
[1:51:38] savagefoxx: yeehaw
[1:51:43] thunder993: Datamining can build hype too, not sure about this
[1:51:44] bayazijr: that sounds like a nightmare
[1:51:44] TheBroCrow: @ColdIceCreamMan sorry you were born on the worse continent USA o7
[1:51:59] Guffels: @Guffels i just dont trust that something like a mob health change wouldnt miss the encryption. not like the entire game is encrypted so it has to be selective
[1:52:04] zenkodac: also imagine doing all the math for a new class tuning in less then a day that would be insane for the poor analysts
[1:52:13] Ruinx81: SoD did it well
[1:52:16] GrafePZL: Risky in that it might be buggy monkaHmm
[1:52:16] Yagr6: zero raid testing would make watching splits more interesting for a day or 2
[1:52:32] smolderdaddyuwu: #HollyHype
[1:52:44] Xanctius: Do we think it will be globally launched to reduce spoilers for different regions?
[1:53:25] smolderdaddyuwu: @Xanctius the patch or the new expansion?
[1:53:32] ShowDUH: Just like you'll have a fuckload of viewer tomorrow wanting to hear your opinion on the Released Hero Talent
[1:53:34] just_ie: So basically 10.2.5 AND 10.2.6 dont have any class reworks when DK warlock warrior and shamans exist
[1:53:35] lordex1919: it says globally
[1:53:37] Squats3: @Xanctius they cant do it. the server team in blizzard is located only in cali and they manage both locations.
[1:53:39] fleks27: im putting my money on no fucking shot
[1:53:39] Xanctius: @smolderdaddyuwu the patch ofcourse
[1:53:41] Whitewolf1441: they dont care about eu

[1:53:44] treesdesu: YEP
[1:53:50] zenkodac: if they dont mention it i would assume it means its the same as it always was
[1:53:52] lordex1919: 1st paragraph
[1:53:54] Squats3: it doesnt it was a "what if"
[1:53:54] Drax_1224: thats SOD
[1:53:55] JoiNatas: maybe ctrl F can find it
[1:53:56] Kynaz01: 2nd line
[1:53:57] dicksosa: it's 100% going to be released one region first
[1:54:00] Zarroe: get rekt eu i guess xddShrug
[1:54:01] LionButLeon: OMEGALUL

[1:54:31] MeisterChiefX: yeah this is incredibly silly and probably wont amount to anything good
[1:54:32] smolderdaddyuwu: @Xanctius xD
[1:54:35] Alarius_: maybe have blizz HQ be in EU and you'd get it first, ez pz
[1:54:36] MONNlBLAST: They released season of discovery globally for no spoilers its notn lile they dont have the tech
[1:54:38] treesdesu: Doggo stretch too
[1:54:38] Yagr6: so they have the tech to do global release on raids too but choose not to bc of sleep
[1:54:43] treesdesu: VeryPog
[1:54:44] Madgeneto: 2x
[1:54:46] SavageFromSpace: @Trodenskjold ive been enjoying Sod a lot tbh

[2:17:48] ubba90: you could be a hot tub streamer
[2:17:50] infraxtion: Max will transition to ASMR
[2:17:51] smolderdaddyuwu: @Maximum long as you stream it so I can follow you bro. I'll follow you homie

[2:19:49] or3g: @sharp710 this sounds like decent content
[2:19:49] psylic: psylic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[2:19:53] ciggyman: getting icerink io
[2:19:53] Tgloss22: eating like a pro but says he forgets to eat all the time lol
[2:20:03] MightyBone_Yumuros: adhd kicks hard
[2:20:15] fnugge: any take on the Fyrakk nerfs yet?
[2:20:18] tow996: main perk of being a RL in ur guild is that u dont have to play the  game NOTED
[2:20:18] spivet: do you think you would still RWF raid if you had do all the prep and alts and stuff involved?
[2:20:39] mrduckytom: @Tgloss22 tbf pro's eat all the time so they also forget they're eating all the time :p
[2:21:01] lleguerre: Do you see yourself being part of MDI again one day ?
[2:21:03] razzzz6: hahaha

[2:21:23] ciggyman: hahaha
[2:21:26] lukec1996: HUH
[2:21:27] celimas: isn't that torghast? Did you push to the max depth?
[2:21:31] razzzz6: i cant get my pugs to learn the mechanics of a dungeon that has been in rotation for 3 months lol
[2:21:33] Gam3rMik3: there should be a dungeon sandbox where players can play as bosses
[2:21:35] JonBarackSnow: and if you die to often the tarragrue should appear
[2:21:58] tow996: its like replaying single player game for like 30 times before u move to the next DLC Aware
[2:22:12] Zoulis: DH can get really tiring after some point
[2:22:26] surfon: send vengeance keys its super fun
[2:22:27] nairb1: whatcha pushin bud
[2:22:33] heat31: Full ADHD Hyperfixation. I get it
[2:22:47] Newchie1: idk how people push keys all season
[2:22:48] breekicheeki9: getting back into an adult hockey league myself, feels fantastic! good on you max
[2:22:51] lukec1996: hyperfixation > burnout
[2:22:59] lukec1996: the vicious cycle
[2:23:04] PunchClockVillain: M+ sucks. Got it.
[2:23:13] whoknowsdude_: tbh wow is only engaging for like 8 weeks
[2:23:26] Clush___: @Maximum ive been novoice pugging to 3500 since s1 and have only added 2 people to my friendslist, us normies dont simply just get a group to play with :)
[2:23:29] spivet: would it stay engaging long enough through all the prep and what not?
[2:24:17] Yagr6: what if blizzard set the comp teams could play ? off meta stuff
[2:24:21] ciggyman: stream with a delay Kappa
[2:24:33] BiBaButzeBenne: if you are such a great problem solver, why not solve things like world hunger. I feel like you are not really committed to the task Kappa
[2:24:41] nephuhlim: react content while practicing ez
[2:24:46] SkirsdagTv: @Clush___ Bro, really? I am always making friends with people i do M+ with
[2:24:47] honeyyyyyy: if they use jdotb's suggestion of stopping dungeon infinite scaling and instead decreasing timer it will end TGP and essentially make MDI style of pushing the only style of pushing
[2:24:50] Tsrif: also the odds of beating Echo who have so much experience together are slim even with all the hours
[2:24:51] Wheva: With Microsoft laying off most of esports people do you think this is the last year of AWC/MDI
[2:24:55] poroyou: moneys just like.. uh.. societal construct or whatever.. man
[2:24:59] Ironwelder: dude, just voted for you.
[2:24:59] conchelobe: Just stream the practice and split income with team. You guys would make bank
[2:25:09] Clush___: @Clush___ @SkirsdagTv literally never happens ever
[2:25:18] Taytor: They'll just contract it out to 3rd party producers
[2:25:27] Milanesa_De_Pollo: yes GIGACHAD put that money towards the game GIGACHAD
[2:25:39] MightyBone_Yumuros: halo esport flopped they kicked out ppl there too
[2:25:48] theDirtyon3: Microsoft has their own esports people too im sure
[2:25:49] PunchClockVillain: What if Saudi Arabia buys MDI? Kappa
[2:25:53] MightyBone_Yumuros: so i think they don't wanna invest into esports
[2:26:07] JengoGG: they could sell cosmetics to help raise the prize pool but... oh wait they did that and scummed the pot xD
[2:26:17] MightyBone_Yumuros: not another Saudi Esports @PunchClockVillain - i hate esports gets used to greenwash countries
[2:26:25] poroyou: some of the layoffs can be attributed to redundancies, MS may already have their own teams
[2:26:36] theDirtyon3: ^
[2:26:36] zannuss: Layoffs
[2:26:37] Yagr6: just and echo cash cow
[2:26:43] tow996: tournaments are suppouse to advertise the game, but wow is so complex that its anti-advertisment KEKW
[2:26:55] Javi11844: Javi11844 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! maximumYeehaw
[2:26:57] nephuhlim: Really, you dont think they gain new players from these events?
[2:27:00] yaboiamsung: waking shores is the best dragonflight zone
[2:27:04] Squats3: @Maximum new pres was in charge of cod esports at one time, right? how'd that turn out?
[2:27:07] Squats3: rip
[2:27:22] conchelobe: @nephuhlim might not be enough to counteract the cost
[2:27:23] grimzero617: Why wouldn't they want to monetize the mdi and awc? It's on a tourney realm. Do sponsors not want in?
[2:27:24] JengoGG: @nephuhlim new player has no idea whats even going on unlike professional league of legends
[2:27:28] anmusallam: microsoft better not cancel AWC
[2:27:32] honeyyyyyy: but do you think they'd lose money in the long run through player-base attrition but cutting MDI/TGP/RWF style events
[2:27:52] tehKrazeee: Frankly, Blizz doesn't know how to monetize public events like this. Overwatch league was a huge fail
[2:27:56] surfon: they can just monetize it better? acquire the ads/commercials
[2:28:04] fdb33: Heres my cook max, MDI gets a new sponsor. Its Onlyfans. All the competitors get accounts. Now they have an income stream to make up for not streaming. Plus Blizz gets in the black. Perfect Synergy
[2:28:08] VRVento: just because microsoft doesn't have a tournament doesn't mean private ones dont pop up
[2:28:16] BiBaButzeBenne: maybe they actually see a grwoth in subscriptions around MDI, because old players reactivating accounts after watching. same with RWF, which definetely also brings players back to try out raids
[2:28:17] MightyBone_Yumuros: kinda curious with Phil commenting on SC II at blizzcon seems like he cares for some esport
[2:28:27] Kawjiryu: awc might be more unwatchable for non wow pvpers lol
[2:28:34] Max0704: You can't watch mdi if you don't know much about m+, and you CANNOT really watch awc if you know nothing about pvp
[2:28:41] kanndle: lol and dota arent exactly easy to watch for people who dont undertsand mobas either
[2:28:42] Zoulis: RWF gigabrings people back. I'm literally here only cause last race was so insane
[2:28:44] PunchClockVillain: I can't even get people I play WoW with to watch MDI
[2:28:45] Whitewolf1441: i resubbed cus of the race
[2:28:49] anmusallam: i dont think they are the same
[2:28:54] StanRaenslen: in person messages pog
[2:29:00] Archerone: MDI is the reason I came back in late legion 100%. RTWF got me back into BFA S4.
[2:29:01] anmusallam: dungeons are forgettable nowadays imo
[2:29:04] Scoops__: the race is normally enough to get me back into the game for a couple of months
[2:29:04] MightyBone_Yumuros: @Max0704 same goes for League of Legends if you don't know the game its hard to follow
[2:29:05] Ryalz: i think the race is different because you can log in and do pretty much the same, MDI dungeons are not even close to the avg experience
[2:29:07] Dasptic: i started playing wow again after watching method kill jaina
[2:29:08] Squats3: wow esports being only on youtube is a really good start
[2:29:12] Squats3: not bieng
[2:29:16] Squats3: being.. fuck i give up
[2:29:20] Ryalz: I know raid's hard but you could be there if you wanted
[2:29:29] Wheva: RWF doesnt really cost them that much, its a community event, all the need is devs to support the game balance.
[2:29:32] RaiNeRpm: My first mdi got me really interested in playing more m+. It was hella confusing forsure but also intriguing
[2:29:34] sellathuru: @Maximum Hey max, hey all jsut arrived, but MDI definitely make people play dungeons more. When you have the MDI, you can see in pug people starting to try to do pulls like them kind of. Not joking, And even if you dont understand all the CCs and everything, you see the giga numbers. people love giga numbers
[2:29:34] lukec1996: Squats3 you tried
[2:29:39] Squats3: i tried
[2:29:49] Qtpants92: Did max already talk about the new ftrak nerfs?
[2:29:50] Squats3: someone is doing overtime
[2:29:53] Qtpants92: Fyrak
[2:30:00] PunchClockVillain: Yeah Liquid and Echo pay for RWF Kappa
[2:30:04] fdb33: Heres my cook max, MDI gets a new sponsor. Its Onlyfans. All the competitors get accounts. Now they have an income stream to make up for not streaming. Plus Blizz gets in the black. Perfect Synergy Û†ÄÄ
[2:30:04] wowtrucker: @ryalz mythic raiding is far from the average persons wow experience.
[2:30:08] itsthelichqueen: Max flying in Dragon Isles OP content! Hi, how are you?  spaced46Wigglynoodle
[2:30:09] iiSmithy: esports is a huge joke in most games tbf
[2:30:20] Chkndh: They could just give us tourney realm access for community run tourneys and it costs them almost nothing
[2:30:24] Squats3: we can fly anywhere and hes still here. must be a good zone
[2:30:26] Lenzoface: it produces interest, marketing, joy, attention to the game etc
[2:30:29] Lenzoface: and a comp scene
[2:30:31] StanRaenslen: they may not bring in extra people - but they might retain more people - with MDI/AWC
[2:30:32] Doimos89: It's also tough for the players because if they don't win they don't get money for their effort
[2:30:39] tow996: mdi is just boring to watch, tgp is way better tbh
[2:30:41] abelknow: They sell toys to fund the tournaments
[2:30:46] Yagr6: fighting games have the best esports and structure
[2:30:49] anmusallam: wargames exist
[2:30:50] Ryalz: @wowtrucker what im sayin is , if you go and watch liquid do tindral you can go in the raid and it's closer to what you than MDI to a normal m+ dungeon
[2:30:53] Science_bfd: dungeon dojo just got announced right
[2:30:55] Max0704: I've looked at the terms, they are very very easy to hit
[2:31:23] Yagr6: have bans
[2:31:28] Squats3: @Maximum OTK got blizzard to have a GM port them out of bounds for their event. bliz absolutely will help you do stuff
[2:31:43] MightyBone_Yumuros: do it LUL
[2:31:44] Drenwow: @Maximum So if the RWF costs them nothing and makes them good money, with this new "asset revision" wouldnt they want to make more raids within an expansion?
[2:31:46] DupliciD: That's a legit good idea
[2:31:59] Ryalz: it's admitting the game's not that balanced
[2:32:03] VRVento: survival KEKW
[2:32:05] shootbuckets101: Hello
[2:32:08] Haarmless: balance team in shambles
[2:32:08] shootbuckets101: How are you doing?
[2:32:11] treesdesu: YEP
[2:32:11] iAruban: was that survival hunter or saomething?
[2:32:12] Yagr6: play ele sham + 10
[2:32:14] shadownerf: were they not more interested in listening to stuff because it came from you though?
[2:32:14] shootbuckets101: Hope you are doing good.
[2:32:27] PunchClockVillain: Windwalker down horrendous.
[2:32:32] StarShopping95: @Maximum Yo off-topic question, did you ever try that purple pillow Jak recommended? If so, would you recommend it?
[2:32:38] VRVento: @PunchClockVillain huh?
[2:32:46] Helios_a: You pick MM hunter? -1
[2:32:48] Helios_a: xd
[2:32:52] Kawjiryu: @Drenwow RWF also doesnt make them any money
[2:32:53] wowtrucker: @ryalz nah. M+ is easier than mythic tindral. You can be half brain dead and time a 20. If you're half brain dead you aren't killing over half the raid on mythic
[2:32:54] BensonOCE: so what happened with it?
[2:32:57] Biscuitpaw: so why didn't you do that comp?
[2:33:03] nakanoviking: !ui
[2:33:09] inf8989: otk tourneys
[2:33:09] Max0704: They have run community tournaments, they are good
[2:33:10] OhYesBryce: ok but you're max and we're not
[2:33:13] Squats3: atrocity ui
[2:33:15] szakal_TV: @Maximum check Scarizard tweet
[2:33:22] nephuhlim: Total cost of this mdi is probably around 300k counting the prize pool. No shot they dont recoup a good percentage of that from streams and new/returning players.
[2:33:22] Max0704: There are public terms you can look at
[2:33:22] imdonexd: @wowtrucker cap af ghost gaming is on fyrak
[2:33:24] mrduckytom: inclusive all WOMEN how is that inclusive?
[2:33:26] jaydoeshair: isn‚Äôt the 1v1 invitational by community?
[2:33:28] beels189: @maximum can it be inclusive if it's all women Kappa
[2:33:32] guynormally: all the hardcore classic tourneys were done by the community
[2:33:33] smolderdaddyuwu: where the all men tourneys?
[2:33:37] Ryalz: @wowtrucker you're misunderstanding my argument, im saying that a viewer watching raid and then them doing it is closer for raids than MDI, not how hard they are
[2:33:38] VRVento: blizzard will take all the PR it can get whilst also spending very little capital
[2:33:41] ultideath: @OhYesBryce we are all max
[2:33:43] duke1014: i think a major point with mdi/tgp is that the outside perspective of the game sees these tournaments and wont be able to easily play the same game like this, compared to something like LCS, where you just go into a game immediately
[2:33:43] shadownerf: just can‚Äôt imagine them being very receiving of such ideas from random joes rather than big names
[2:33:43] theDirtyon3: @mrduckytom bro stop lol
[2:33:48] Dogyy666: if u have girl in team u have 3 extra points
[2:33:54] Yagr6: @beels189 sure bc i can say im this or that
[2:33:55] lleguerre: The founder of mandatory 'french stremer) does some tournaments on wow and sometimes they give him a special server for that
[2:34:00] mrduckytom: @theDirtyon3 what i say is true....
[2:34:01] zannuss: For now they do
[2:34:03] nephuhlim: 260k
[2:34:04] kelly_mac06: @imdonexd didn't they implode tho lol
[2:34:07] BiBaButzeBenne: 10 bucks
[2:34:09] cryptisk: 260k
[2:34:12] aescend_: 5 billion
[2:34:23] Ryalz: @wowtrucker like you seeing an MDI run will never happen in game, but you watching a raid is closer to what you experience in game, as an argument why raid's more enticing to watch
[2:34:28] business_man_alex: They say generally your costs are 3x your prize pool
[2:34:29] wowtrucker: @ryalz easier to get into a dungeon than a raid though
[2:34:37] LudoB99: @smolderdaddyuwu It's called the RWF LUL
[2:34:38] ruediruempel: 260k
[2:34:42] imdonexd: @kelly_mac06 blas0n is unbreakable he will rebuild
[2:34:50] theDirtyon3: @mrduckytom no
[2:35:03] Ryalz: @wowtrucker for sure, but I dont think you'll ever get close to the shit they do in MDIs
[2:35:12] Taytor: before I got turbo they play 5 minutes between each round
[2:35:17] business_man_alex: They do the minimum
[2:35:24] roguerhino: between rounds for sure
[2:35:26] VRVento: they still get money for the ads if you have turbo and a sub
[2:35:29] exz_96: ublock origin baby
[2:35:29] smolderdaddyuwu: no ads on YT for AWC
[2:35:31] Taytor: Round for MDI* to be clear.
[2:35:32] tow996: just get arab prince like dota 2 and host 1 milion dollar tournaments every month + 15 million dollars one at the end of season KEKW
[2:35:33] mrduckytom: @theDirtyon3 nothing inclusive when only one group is allowed it's exclusive elitisme....
[2:35:47] roguerhino: yes
[2:35:49] Ryalz: yea
[2:35:50] Taytor: Yeah after they played their full set

[2:35:57] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[2:36:05] business_man_alex: @mrduckytom shhhhh quiet down kiddo
[2:36:17] wowtrucker: @ryalz I mean I think they're comparable. You can do both. But I think the thing is that raiding is funner for a lot of people than doing the same dungeon over and over for 6 months
[2:36:29] con_artist__: i got hit pretty much after every round for 6-8 ads
[2:36:31] shadownerf: @wowtrucker idk, I get into raid every week pretty easy but get several hours of declines from lfg m+ per night
[2:36:33] mrduckytom: @theDirtyon3 ok ii'll make an inclusvie all men tounrnament, lets see how many people will call it inclusive... as it's the exact same thing
[2:36:45] Ganryu22: 15-20K

[2:37:12] SandStorm273: ad break
[2:37:13] imdonexd: @theDirtyon3 dog stop letting the worms in ur brain talk
[2:37:16] SandStorm273: ironically
[2:37:21] explic_cit: its usually 22-25k
[2:37:23] GLYFEnation: Just check Sullygnome for the correct stats
[2:37:24] Ryalz: after first day they'll drop hard since it's seeing the same thing after that lol
[2:37:24] Taytor: 21st was the 1st day. 14th was the patch day
[2:37:26] smolderdaddyuwu: 14th sounds right
[2:37:26] Taytor: IIRC
[2:37:37] itsthelichqueen: Nov, 21st
[2:37:39] itsthelichqueen: :)
[2:37:43] OG_Kawngi: @theDirtyon3 @mrduckytom you may have brain damage
[2:37:50] Taytor: I am wrong then
[2:37:57] BiBaButzeBenne: assuming the "growth in subscribers" as the return of investment: 1million is like 70k "subscriber months" which would be 12k people who sub for half a year for example @Maximum this sounds realistic for RWF, but not for MDI or arena
[2:37:59] jjwallababy: @JWallace bro my last name is wallace and my first name starts with a J. Are we the same person???
[2:38:00] mrduckytom: @theDirtyon3 so explain me the difference between all women and all men other than the gender....if you can't just be quiet
[2:38:00] wowtrucker: Nov 14th was race opening
[2:38:10] wowtrucker: Thanksgiving was the 23rd
[2:38:20] ruediruempel: 14 was split day KEKW

[2:38:46] lukec1996: Modge
[2:38:48] Ruinx81: Good guy mods
[2:38:51] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: mods really fuckin up not scamming with ads
[2:38:58] Taytor: PETTHEMODS
[2:38:59] Mister__Mango: Damn, time to start streaming what the heck
[2:39:01] daiger5o: So i subbed for nothing?
[2:39:02] Koodiijr: 22k an hour LMAO
[2:39:08] Koodiijr: err 16 hours
[2:39:15] GrimFandango: 22k/hr or total?
[2:39:18] BobyDK1: Isnt in the earnings page?
[2:39:20] conchelobe: They will not make a alot in 6 hours at half that then
[2:39:20] reggiepowa: 22k an hour EZ
[2:39:21] business_man_alex: And that gets split in the raid
[2:39:21] sellathuru: @Mister__Mango You need to get 40k viewers though xD
[2:39:25] Ryalz: @Mister__Mango the hard part is getting to those  viewership numbers lol
[2:39:26] Koodiijr: takes me 4 months to make that
[2:39:27] GrimFandango: and that's $10 a day to Driney
[2:39:29] BobyDK1: oh its usually a different colour
[2:39:31] Ruinx81: $22k?
[2:39:35] theDirtyon3: Max making that Bezos money
[2:39:37] mrduckytom: @theDirtyon3 relating to society or social relations: both would fall under that description... so i rest my case silver knighting isn't it people
[2:39:44] business_man_alex: It's two separate bars usually on the main screen
[2:39:53] Mister__Mango: @Ryalz If I believe hard enough, I will make it
[2:39:58] business_man_alex: At least for the three cents I made when I streamed
[2:40:15] nephuhlim: does blizzard play twitch ads or do they sell placements though?
[2:40:17] business_man_alex: Yeah about 5 an hour is fair
[2:40:19] Ganryu22: roudn is probably 30-40 min
[2:40:20] roguerhino: yea roughly depending on key
[2:40:26] Mister__Mango: Maybe the awc doesnt cost them that much money xdd
[2:40:27] GrimFandango: @nephuhlim oh this is a good point
[2:40:29] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: but viewership for mdi kinda low
[2:40:30] Ganryu22: most dungeons are cleaned in less than 15 minutes
[2:40:35] ruediruempel: only 500‚Ç¨/h LUL
[2:40:49] business_man_alex: Because they talk about it for 15 mins before and after
[2:40:51] guynormally: Warcraft channel probably has a better ad deal w/ twitch than most streamers, too
[2:41:02] ToxicLG: Like $2k for blizzard for an mdi day
[2:41:04] VRVento: do they have sponsors at all
[2:41:05] ToxicLG: Bit less
[2:41:07] roguerhino: @Maximum nephuhlim has a good point because im pretty sure they run placement adds not twitch adds
[2:41:20] business_man_alex: Damn that's nothing
[2:41:24] business_man_alex: Lmao
[2:41:27] spivet: have you ever talked behind the scenes with the wow esports folks about why they don't have their own sponsors? just don't care too much about the money?
[2:41:33] ToxicLG: Then there's also paying casters
[2:41:41] jjwallababy: @nephuhlim your UI is goated garf
[2:41:41] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: they also stream on youtube still tho right?
[2:41:45] SandStorm273: $42
[2:41:46] BensonOCE: at least a billy KEKW
[2:41:46] Clarius: 420 dollars
[2:41:48] kurleth: they also stream on YT and the official site while running ads on those
[2:41:48] monkeytimeee: @Maximum also not counting the amount of viewers you take away from MDI watching mdi :)
[2:41:48] Zhirak: they have sponsors too
[2:41:50] BobyDK1: Imagine if they run 22 mins of ads like i do LUL
[2:41:50] Doimos89: 50k from returning players
[2:41:50] smolderdaddyuwu: 2k? that 134 returning players..
[2:41:55] VRVento: its a write off on the logs for sure
[2:42:00] lukec1996: they make 75k/hr from returning playeres subs and buying draggonflight
[2:42:01] cabita31: how much do you think they pay the casters?
[2:42:03] lukec1996: source: trust me bro
[2:42:16] MitssORLY: @smolderdaddyuwu or 134 bots account that get banned a month later
[2:42:17] rhsiuol: @Maximum You gonna play last epoch when it officially launches?
[2:42:22] ruediruempel: blizzard makes like 1/10 from the ads but they get other benefits as well
[2:42:44] NC_Jake: yes
[2:42:46] shawkeem: i would assume so
[2:42:47] stefb0b: ofc
[2:42:48] introduction09: yes
[2:42:49] Fuzziew: Why wouldn't you be able to?
[2:42:50] joekandy: oh for sure
[2:42:50] doccpotato: ask again
[2:42:50] nephuhlim: its gotta be 100%
[2:42:51] conchelobe: I imagine you can
[2:42:52] business_man_alex: Yes as advertising my ap team told me about this once
[2:42:52] shawkeem: its probably a demand gen thing
[2:42:53] Mister__Mango: Hmmmm, does blizzard do tax evasion?
[2:42:54] FatPanda97: Definitely a business expense
[2:42:54] realryzuh: @Maximum 100% a tax write off
[2:42:59] ToxicLG: Accountants in chat monkaW
[2:43:01] mrduckytom: well it's a commercial expense yes
[2:43:02] shawkeem: trying to garner interest in the game
[2:43:03] Eltved3: probably
[2:43:08] logicaltty: can y'all do my taxes for me
[2:43:14] ncg20: You think a company like that wouldn't have accountants that would make that happen?
[2:43:15] celimas: that's not quite how that works
[2:43:17] CorrosiveLotion: i have done accounting for serveral big companies event money is always tax written off
[2:43:21] celimas: like sure, you get some percentage back by writing it off
[2:43:27] celimas: but you'd still rather just lose less money in the first place
[2:43:30] oneifbyland: @logicaltty sure. DM me your SSN and paperwork
[2:43:30] weezie_61: Those Poddy C ads on youtube be killin me the for real.  It is like every 30 seconds.
[2:43:30] conchelobe: They're gunenteed doing things the smartest way. They pay people to make sure of that lol
[2:43:34] Painbows: sponsored by baja blast BatChest
[2:43:40] SkirsdagTv: Demon Hunter Baja Blast for the 2025 MDI Championship
[2:43:41] fdb33: all the mobs r tacos and the bosses r chalupa supremes its fucking perfect
[2:43:42] monkeytimeee: It would be better
[2:43:45] business_man_alex: @celimas what this guy said. It's offset by let's say 30%
[2:43:48] szakal_TV: I just want Dratnos to read taco bell's adds
[2:43:49] mrduckytom: if it's sponsosrred it's no longer reductable as a promotional costs
[2:43:55] Orange_SM: if they take a loss on the mid they can write if off in there taxes
[2:44:02] ruediruempel: Taco bell for an esport event as sponsor? LUL
[2:44:03] NC_Jake: Paperwork, who really wants to do all that paperwork.
[2:44:04] reggiepowa: 5Head
[2:44:08] Orange_SM: mdi
[2:44:10] smolderdaddyuwu: he made that up bro
[2:44:13] stefb0b: just get sponsors to sponsor some shit
[2:44:13] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: It's income if you sell the sponsorship
[2:44:13] roguerhino: but if blizz does what riot does with esports they would gain such a higher rate of return
[2:44:14] Virridian: He's an idiot though
[2:44:15] VRVento: check his chat history he has also said some cringe asss shit kEKW
[2:44:15] xenshea: max how big are those fyrakk nerfs
[2:44:19] Lego17: isnt the prize winnings taxed as a 1099 so doesn‚Äôt that make it wages from blizzards side??
[2:44:20] BreezyWinter: you mean blizzard doesn't want what happened with league worlds where i heard mercedes, coke, mastercard at least 300k times over the duration
[2:44:20] wowtrucker: Talk about a sinking ship. Lcs is a dumpster fire
[2:44:21] mrduckytom: @smolderdaddyuwu wanna bet?
[2:44:25] oneifbyland: did Sooki ever get to meet Jake from Statefarm?? Pog
[2:44:27] Virelo: @xenshea 10% kekw
[2:44:36] Ganryu22: Makes sense, imagine getting tax write off while getting free money
[2:44:41] Warptime: if it's sponsored than u cant raise the deductible on the roth IRA for the sake of the valuation
[2:44:42] smolderdaddyuwu: black friday ez
[2:44:47] The_Mail_Man__: RWF sponsored by taco bell and mountain dew Pog
[2:44:48] BobyDK1: Ads rates in decemember was so pog LUL
[2:45:00] ToxicLG: I wonder how many people that watch mdi in the blizzard channel are from EU rather than NA too
[2:45:22] grimsarn8: how much oveerall
[2:45:29] senexis: i make 8k a year
[2:45:30] miniath_: you can account for that by multiplying that by the ratio of ad rates i'd guess
[2:45:32] business_man_alex: I wonder if you could equate a recession to ad rates. Got me thinking
[2:45:37] stefb0b: eu wins, ofc theres alot
[2:45:50] karkarnarnar: they probably still get EU adds
[2:45:50] oneifbyland: EU low-value BIG TRU
[2:46:02] vellic4: EU are more competitive
[2:46:09] SkirsdagTv: is it not kinda nice that you guys get to run the event that you guys currated and not have to have any blizz oversight
[2:46:15] monkeytimeee: EU cares about higher key play more than NA - NA has more 18-20 players than 25+
[2:46:35] Plexxen92: EU diff
[2:46:43] sethron: this music goes hard
[2:46:43] battlenetq: stop flyings arounds and do some 30=
[2:46:44] tow996: firstGarf
[2:46:47] szakal_TV: maybe EU is more competetive but it's NA with egir tier list
[2:46:48] conchelobe: Fire him
[2:46:53] business_man_alex: Max how are ad rates right now out of curiosity?
[2:46:55] xanahar: yo, you knew about wizk insta killing link? what you think about it
[2:47:03] infinite_ten: how is the Apple Vision Pro?
[2:47:05] rexyG: i liked this week's video a lot
[2:47:07] abelknow: Go tmog run with chat
[2:47:07] smolderdaddyuwu: e girls? where??
[2:47:11] Taytor: I wish I was on an egirl tierlist
[2:47:11] Whitewolf1441: egirl tierlist?
[2:47:23] guynormally: @Rizzalicious_ not good, jan/feb is bad for advertising. so is summer
[2:47:31] reggiepowa: it wouldnt be a bad idea if not for couple of crazy people
[2:47:35] Whitewolf1441: its dehumanizing
[2:47:38] splashz0r: common grom W on his tierlist BASED
[2:47:42] Taytor: I mean most people on the list gave permission.
[2:47:42] maccrazor: max will you raid lead the next tier from the Apple visions?  all 20 povs in widescreen for you to swipe through.  technology
[2:47:45] Taytor: People just got mad on their behalf
[2:47:50] ToxicLG: Can we do a boss tier list but its based on how fuckable each end boss is?
[2:47:51] sethron: Noodle will rise again, I have faith
[2:48:11] therealjuhbone: will anyone beat the BFA AD time ?
[2:48:42] mrduckytom: @smolderdaddyuwu i could go on, if you want to organise an e-sports tournament you should actually make a C-corp so your taxrates on sales during the event go down to 13,125% as a us companny... maybe talk less out of your rear end for attention some people actually know this kinda stuff ;)
[2:48:44] kelly_mac06: @therealjuhbone what was it? can't remember now
[2:48:45] nephuhlim: noodle knew what he was cookin up LOL
[2:48:45] vuntervunter: Unrelated but HPriest community very turbulent right now
[2:48:54] Taytor: Yeah I can see that. idk I guess I know noodle a bit better so I know it came from a fun place for him. But I can see the knock on yeah
[2:49:00] Mei_tricks: MySpace top 8 was the most toxic shit ever
[2:49:00] Whitewolf1441: @vuntervunter what happened
[2:49:02] BigbadKevin: have you ever done a team liquid team tier list @Maximum
[2:49:15] therealjuhbone: @therealjuhbone i think it was 9:50
[2:49:21] vuntervunter: @Whitewolf1441 Response to Jak's retrospective
[2:49:27] AbyssAmun: @therealjuhbone There's was a 4th affix back in BFA, it change things too ^^'
[2:49:45] therealjuhbone: @therealjuhbone awakened
[2:49:48] custom025: He never hid what he looked like
[2:49:50] Warptime: @smolderdaddyuwu cool story business boy, you wearing your suit right now?
[2:50:01] Haarmless: nah
[2:50:03] Reluctors: not doxxing imo
[2:50:03] guynormally: technically, yes
[2:50:09] flow_mein: nah
[2:50:16] reggiepowa: I dont think it is
[2:50:17] Swiftar: illegal no
[2:50:23] Guffels: if its not easily identifiable, how can it be a dox?
[2:50:23] business_man_alex: I wouldn't think so
[2:50:27] Crucaider: Your face is not a protected piece of information
[2:50:28] The_Mail_Man__: they did do that but that wasnt the breaking point
[2:50:31] leyya_: liquid raiding today
[2:50:36] oneifbyland: not doxxing if it was just a DM. could be extortion if a threat/demand was made with it
[2:50:40] BigTrout3: we're lawyers, the answer is no
[2:50:44] Mister__Mango: i wouldve been slightly inconvienced by it
[2:50:47] Haarmless: idk where the line is
[2:50:52] Nekrans: I feel like just a face isn't doxxing, but it's close
[2:50:53] oneifbyland: oh tweeting
[2:50:55] s_thetic_steve: whats your address? beat them to it
[2:50:58] custom025: Releasing things that arent public info is doxing
[2:50:58] sorliee: There is a billion people named max smith ur good
[2:51:02] BigTrout3: beats me
[2:51:03] custom025: Ie phone number
[2:51:03] Jjmn12: you got a fake ass name anyway
[2:51:03] guynormally: Not all doxxing is illegal. Doxxing is just revealing any personally identifying information about someone.
[2:51:08] Grimm303: google says "While it may not be wise to give out someone's address, it is not illegal to do so."
[2:51:10] Nekrans: Definition for Dox: search for and publish private or identifying information about (a particular individual) on the internet, typically with malicious intent.
[2:51:12] smolderdaddyuwu: doxxing refers to physical location I believe
[2:51:14] nephuhlim: its america you can sue anyone for anything
[2:51:16] business_man_alex: Max you do such a great job of talking about sensitive issues without getting the chat charged just wanted to say props
[2:51:17] RyanC: hardcore bm. if his face was technically out there
[2:51:22] logicaltty: i don't think doxxing is even illegal unless you like hack someone to get the information
[2:51:26] mikedawg5000: mikedawg5000 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:51:29] Dengara: publicly exposing someone's real name, address, job, or other identifying info without a victim's consent.
[2:51:33] Crucaider: Doxxing in and of itself isn't illegal, it's the actions taken by people after that
[2:51:41] suclarberg: just joined what happened?
[2:51:52] GodKingMuninn: Cam we get some Azure span flying, go back to the beta days of mindless flying
[2:51:55] forshard: 1guy
[2:51:56] Crucaider: It's super fucked
[2:51:57] SkirsdagTv: That is factually incorrect
[2:51:58] iGDISH: ‚Äúrestricted personal information‚Äù of certain individuals publicly available if it was done with an intent to threaten, intimidate or in an act of violence -some website
[2:51:59] RyanC: morally yeah
[2:52:02] RyanC: oh yeah
[2:52:04] Mister__Mango: It is morally wrong indeed
[2:52:05] FatPanda97: If it's in the public domain, and aquired through good faith measure it likely wouldn't be considered illegal
[2:52:10] BigTrout3: YEP v fucked
[2:52:22] talync_: depends on jurisdiction, but it is definitely illegal in some places
[2:52:42] i_cassius: i_cassius subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:52:48] prugar: I like how people still prove that a good portion of gamers are still socially idiots in 2024 and forever
[2:52:50] nephuhlim: grom is foul LOL
[2:52:53] guynormally: let's ask JB to give us a 3 hour lecture on it
[2:53:15] theDirtyon3: YEP
[2:53:20] roguerhino: they eat that shit up
[2:53:21] Reluctors: he always takes it 1 or 2 steps too far
[2:53:21] IsThatGuyOK: JB is the Goat. Let's do it.
[2:53:23] Diazanite: oh i can assure u theres no 'probably' there LMFAO
[2:53:26] Fizzbot125: There were some really really nasty clips from Grom
[2:53:27] abelknow: Grom ate my children
[2:53:33] Mister__Mango: nice episode on the PoddyC this week, I love pressing ascendance as a ele shaman connoiseur myself
[2:53:37] drewsky96: bit of a come to jesus moment

[2:55:45] Krappyboi: Yeah it could just be one spec each for these
[2:55:46] Serup_: one from each
[2:55:47] DasAutoChat: they gave us half druid before so
[2:55:50] Sekrai: only one tree each
[2:55:56] thegreatdestroyer27607: 1 shared
[2:56:11] sorliee: ICANT
[2:56:12] Keionys_: The pally ones gotta get nuked into the sun. That one sounds like hot street trash.
[2:56:14] Osterberg501: Can't wait to see priest, gonna be s tier, or absolutely horrible.
[2:56:17] sorliee: Max showing up early ICANT
[2:56:39] Nickystr1x: i feel like seeing 2 for the same class is important to show how they can create diversity/balance them
[2:56:44] Benjg7: no more support hero talent trees
[2:56:45] jondbr: @maximum I‚Äôm late did you already give your Bieber take
[2:56:48] KaisenSiru: Theme Pog
[2:56:48] Benjg7: please
[2:56:49] d4_damager_: warlocks is going to be a rushed piece of shit as usual
[2:56:52] mrduckytom: @sorliee and staying on starting soon for 2 hours
[2:56:52] Karkesis: the evoker tree was sauce upon sauce I can‚Äôt wait
[2:56:54] treesdesu: YEP Û†ÄÄ
[2:56:56] fleks27: if mage hero talents dont turn me into jaina and i can freeze an entire city im gonna be mad
[2:57:11] Dengara: I just want to see shaman so I can know if I need to give up on Ele or not finally
[2:57:11] itsthelichqueen: I know I'm VERY late on the subject but on your first stream of RTW, you had an average of 41 606 viewers with a peak of 79 325! spaced46Gasp (info from community management tools)
[2:57:14] delirious152007: I'm praying "Pack Leader" for BM is cool
[2:57:14] Crucaider: Numbers mean fuckall this early in dev
[2:57:22] Krappyboi: The paladin one was kinda whatever lorewise or thematically too
[2:57:36] Karkesis: @fleks27 I‚Äôm tryna call down a swarm of meteors like Khadgar did to that one bridge
[2:57:36] Clush___: lightsmith
[2:57:37] Faraday5001: lightsmith
[2:57:38] drewsky96: thought mountain thane was boring af
[2:57:38] Drax_1224: the warrior one was wack
[2:57:40] Benjg7: the pally one is dogshit
[2:57:48] Swiftar: 1st amendment paladin
[2:57:48] Sekrai: Lightsmith did sound ass
[2:57:48] Haarmless: if you guys thought the game was already unbalanced just wait till there are even more trees and tuning nobs
[2:57:48] Clush___: cringesmith
[2:57:50] antipheonixna: lightsmith KEKW
[2:58:03] DasAutoChat: maybe it is broken Pog
[2:58:07] pokirane: anyone else hear audio crackling or am i Dentge
[2:58:10] abelknow: Do they craft light gear?
[2:58:13] Clush___: @Maximum imagine if lightsmith is just the most powerful and we all hav eto run around picking up shit in keys
[2:58:22] itsthelichqueen: @pokirane nah, I don't.
[2:58:37] smolderdaddyuwu: the rain will slow it down bud
[2:58:44] Yagr6: nice i ordered a kraken
[2:58:46] treesdesu: I have the right to bear The Light KKona o7
[2:59:05] Alarius_: the premium high quality copper
[2:59:15] roguerhino: @smolderdaddyuwu rain has been slowin down. plus orders have been goin fine
[2:59:26] splashz0r: @Haarmless i dont think the game is unbalanced
[2:59:35] RSTight: It really is
[2:59:39] Jack_the_Dipper: Unless you did something with your current cables, XLR are pretty strong
[2:59:45] ibjorgi: as long as the hero talents are fun, that's all that matters, the numbers can be fixed
[2:59:45] RSTight: better than MOST patches for sure
[2:59:52] GodKingMuninn: Tuning isn't a problem but there are specs with serious design flaws that are being neglected
[2:59:55] Datguyjay: people were mad at dh at start of the patch is all
[3:00:03] Diazanite: its not balanced if my spec isnt the top dps by a mile Madge
[3:00:05] Malorash: Malorash subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:00:08] pokirane: haven't really seen but are all hero talents passive?
[3:00:08] delirious152007: Balanced until the untested 10.2.6 ;)
[3:00:24] slappadabas5: how does tuning relate to utility?...like ele tuned well, but still ignored for high level content
[3:00:30] wandering_chacos: dh is nutty and it feels bad to do anything else because your group looses too much.
[3:00:38] Oracle_WoW: prot war with silence sigil would be fine
[3:00:41] NotReallyAdrian: healing tuning is big stink imo
[3:00:41] Benjg7: compare vdh with two sigils to prot needing to take shockwave as a capstone
[3:00:46] RyanC: were those pink crocs? respect. @maximum
[3:00:46] Benjg7: it‚Äôs not equal
[3:00:48] Haarmless: @splashz0r I think it's a good spot but with more talent trees I think that it will take even more time and manpower to balance everything. It seems like things are just getting a bit crazy
[3:00:50] Dengara: In your opinion, what is a ranged spec to play that's similar in playstyle to Ele?
[3:00:57] Eleemz: This season also has a very large amount of pulls where aoe stops and silence is insane because lots of mobs dont get a lockout when they get kicked
[3:00:59] vuntervunter: Again unrelated, but does the US do a Married at First Sight tv show like Australia?
[3:01:21] GodKingMuninn: Yes theres a few of those
[3:01:34] NotReallyAdrian: warriors need jesus when it comes to m+ utility KEKW
[3:01:47] Auphius: also, defensiveness is less important in 90% of other seasons
[3:01:48] smolderdaddyuwu: @vuntervunter yeah probably.
[3:01:50] Krappyboi: Warriors do need god
[3:02:05] Apeirophobic: or survive one shots
[3:02:06] vuntervunter: Cause it's freaking wild down here
[3:02:19] s_thetic_steve: MDI comps are interesting
[3:02:19] asd123qwerty1: @maximum did u open vault?
[3:02:25] homievegetable: true tho after the MDI all you'll see is people not taking anything else than whats seen there
[3:02:26] oresties: Does blizzard think we're so far gone that an in game "date simulator" toy is added to the game?!
[3:02:29] honeyyyyyy: or ret
[3:02:34] tylxrwow: It's nto damage
[3:02:38] tylxrwow: its damage profiles
[3:02:44] tylxrwow: priority damage
[3:02:48] business_man_alex: Which is literally just having verse be your best spec
[3:02:49] crazyrusdogy: vers stacking classes dont benefit as much from augs
[3:02:57] BigBadAzz1: Yo @Maximum
[3:03:27] business_man_alex: Get verse out of the game. It's lazy design
[3:03:34] xwukongx3: what‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs opinion on prot warriors?
[3:03:41] Camelbak21: Would be better if DPS is what limited you, and not what you could live to a certain degree
[3:03:41] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite
[3:03:57] Durenas: stats double dip naturally so you gain power faster than the scaling can keep up with
[3:04:00] Sajtox: except everbloom
[3:04:18] seen7037: yea health needs to scale faster
[3:04:19] Petarglio: they need to stop designing m+ bosses to have random bs one-shots like flame shock and shadow bolt
[3:04:25] Crucaider: Everyone gets 1 shot at a certain key level
[3:04:28] BigBadAzz1: Throne of the Tides
[3:04:31] business_man_alex: As an enhance player please
[3:04:42] crimsonwarcraft: the highest tyrannical waycrests are a good example, mages on the tree boss lol
[3:04:55] smolderdaddyuwu: 35 Junkyard??
[3:05:04] business_man_alex: Raid we are actually tanky m+ just hits different
[3:05:29] Haarmless: do you think they should have m+ damage scale at like half the rate of hp scaling?

[3:06:47] kadashy1: and those people wont do those higher keys often even
[3:07:10] Durenas: frankly, the keys are easy right now, right up until they're not.

[3:07:45] erkz007: remove tyran
[3:08:02] xxx_dagron_xxx: I feel like Challenge Modes were more fun than high M+
[3:08:04] BigBadAzz1: Remove Bursting bruh
[3:08:08] Slapsstick: what if they made tyran only increase boss damage and not hp by that amount
[3:08:40] 324bee21: Challenge modes were better because they capped gear it was mroe about execution
[3:08:47] menzlo: What was elles idea??
[3:08:54] BigBadAzz1: Mythic keystones should be our gateway to raiding\
[3:08:57] pokirane: maxJAM jazz baby
[3:08:59] sorliee: Chatting
[3:09:10] Ruinx81: What would challenge modes compare to these days? A 20?
[3:09:10] gwaimag: Don't know if this question is asked a lot but do you think windwalker is getting some sort of rework before this expansion?
[3:09:17] nightst314: @324bee21 speedruns in CM are also really stressful, especially when 1 GCD can cost you a new record
[3:09:17] Durenas: they should make myth grade gear available from raid vault
[3:09:19] Eleemz: So effectively changing it from 8% hp/8% dmg to something like 8%hp/6%dmg or something
[3:09:30] eyeztea: having to play veng/prot for kicks is annoying af in m+
[3:09:39] Haarmless: true
[3:09:49] MBG_95: so like Health scales at 10% but damage scales at 8%?
[3:09:52] business_man_alex: That's a good idea as long as we also get rid of tyran fuck fighting a boss for five minutes
[3:09:55] Haarmless: getting 1 shot isn't fun but mobs having more hp still kinda fun
[3:09:56] nightst314: how is that a new idea?
[3:10:13] BensonOCE: that will always be hit eventually though with infinite scaling. it just changes where the bottleneck is
[3:10:16] dango0n: I wish they would bring back challenge modes with unique armor sets.
[3:10:21] 324bee21: but isn't that why challenge modes were fun, you knew they were doable it was about doing them faster and faster
[3:10:32] antipheonixna: max when will u craft up a hypothetical m+ rework with the boys
[3:10:32] delirious152007: How about someone bricks your key cuz they got upset at a wipe and leaves randomly.....
[3:10:47] guynormally: @BensonOCE not necessarily. if done right the bottleneck will be timer, not one shots
[3:10:53] Haarmless: @BensonOCE yeah but the bottleneck should always be the timer, not that nobody can survive a mechanic
[3:11:07] jondbr: next pod you guys should just write theoretical patch notes for a rework
[3:11:11] sorliee: pink panther ahh song
[3:11:14] realGameTheory: Bedge
[3:11:25] Durenas: i think the scaling needs to be a curve
[3:11:28] realGameTheory: Wokege
[3:11:32] d4_damager_: i just think affixes are the biggest problem by far. It sucks to just not be able to progress for 1 or 2 weeks because of shitty affixes
[3:11:36] Wildfire_Gaming: Chatting
[3:11:42] Drenwow: Chatting
[3:11:51] dango0n: @Maximum what spec do you think is most down bad and in need of a rework?
[3:12:03] Haarmless: @d4_damager_ I think they're fine but they need to be tuned a bit more
[3:12:03] DasAutoChat: affixes are pretty easy now adays
[3:12:05] DasAutoChat: tbh
[3:12:07] DasAutoChat: LUL
[3:12:07] Ruinx81: Bursting is anti m+
[3:12:07] nightst314: @Maximum no Incorp is the worst, data shows it
[3:12:11] Blargman2833: Yes still bad tho
[3:12:17] abelknow: Teeming skidish
[3:12:18] whoknowsdude_: why don't they have like 14 dungeons a season?
[3:12:26] Tainted0ne_Tv: There is just nothing fun about affixes
[3:12:30] AnesthesiaFC: are affixes for keys up to devs or does the community get some voice in MDI?
[3:12:30] Camelbak21: They add depression every week
[3:12:35] Bigoze: best day ever!
[3:12:38] 324bee21: Bursting, Bolstering, they make the pulls unfun
[3:12:38] business_man_alex: Affixes should on positives
[3:12:42] DasAutoChat: i think i would be fucking boring LUL
[3:12:45] business_man_alex: Only*
[3:12:46] tylxrwow: seasonals only pls
[3:12:46] Keionys_: If they have to keep nerfing them to the point where they are not noticable what's the point of even having them at all?
[3:12:48] Krappyboi: The affixes should reward you for doing them correctly I think to make them fun
[3:12:57] GrimFandango: Affixes don't change anything about dungeon routing, except if they do then they're horrible to play with / around. So they just shouldn't exist.
[3:13:04] oneifbyland: yea but bolstered Spotters in Siege of Boralus were fun as hell
[3:13:06] tiyanigean: apparently unpopular opinion: I like it that at some point enemy npc numbers are the limit, rather than the timer being too short. I dont like timers *shrug
[3:13:07] dango0n: I dont like affixes that make me stop my dps rotation to dispel or cc a thing and then try to pick my rotation back up
[3:13:11] delirious152007: I miss seasonals
[3:13:16] mantooth11: I don't get the argument that no affixes would be boring. I never see afflicted and think it makes a dungeon more interesting.
[3:13:18] Xanctius: What if affixes rotated more often?
[3:13:19] JonBarackSnow: on EU the affixes are the same on tuesday FeelsBadMan
[3:13:21] Wiikz: problem is some of the affixes, and the affix combos imo
[3:13:27] antipheonixna: thundering, nuff said
[3:13:31] 324bee21: weeks and to a lesser extent certain dungeons should not be so much easier or harder than others that it becomes noticeable
[3:13:38] gwaimag: max is blizzard planning on making ww monk shine with a juicy rework or is it doomed?
[3:13:46] SpeedyMcD: do we know how many bosses will be in first raid of new xpac?
[3:13:46] GrimFandango: BatChest I love Incorporeal!!!
[3:13:47] Alarius_: im big gaming with zero affixes
[3:13:48] dageer__: do you think the game is dying in some way?
[3:13:49] Oracle_WoW: that shit would get old pretty fast
[3:13:52] Haarmless: yep
[3:13:53] skeeld: hard agree
[3:13:57] AnesthesiaFC: no affixes would cause burnout a lot faster for sure
[3:13:57] business_man_alex: Agree
[3:13:58] smolderdaddyuwu: really no affixes? wow.. that'd old af real god damn fast
[3:13:59] GrimFandango: @dageer__ lmao, what
[3:14:04] Varae__: All of my friends quit the week with shit affixes and don't come back
[3:14:05] Jonesing23: what if, start affixes at 20?
[3:14:05] Tainted0ne_Tv: I play less m+ because of affixes
[3:14:06] Artheeri: i think seasonals can do so much on that front, they just need to be good 4Head
[3:14:08] GLYFEnation: Why are gamers always "cooking" things.
[3:14:09] Perry_TP: Afflicted and Incorp gives people a free week off so players don't burn out :)
[3:14:10] d4_damager_: i would like affixes if they were tailored to the specific dungeons, not just randomly added whether it makes the experience good or not
[3:14:11] fallb4me: I think seasonal affixes would be ok if there were no other affixes
[3:14:12] Camelbak21: That's literally the case now, cya in 2 weeks when affixes are better. Oopsie, John never came back
[3:14:13] Reluctors: i think affixes can be good, but the current ones are meh
[3:14:14] atamdev: if anything i will sit out weeks because of affixes
[3:14:16] sethron: fine, affixes only above +20 then
[3:14:17] Alarius_: they keep making dungeons with way too many mechanics to handle... with zero affixes that is fine.
[3:14:19] oneifbyland: that would be like doing Mythic raid reclears but it drops no loot DansGame
[3:14:19] business_man_alex: Just make encrypted again
[3:14:24] dageer__: @GrimFandango i said something wrong?
[3:14:26] Oracle_WoW: especially if they remove fort and tyran. that would be awful
[3:14:29] antipheonixna: less mechanics, bigger pulls, enivironmental interactables, a positive affix included with negatives
[3:14:29] gandalf_wow: @Maximum have you guys started Fyrakk sales?
[3:14:29] fallb4me: reaping was fun
[3:14:31] eduu9310: just a seasonal affix and call it
[3:14:34] splashz0r: @atamdev sounds like a you problem tbh
[3:14:34] shawkeem: what about only season affix?
[3:14:39] bramwow: we had bangers affixes in SL
[3:14:46] abelknow: I think spam mythic raid would be sick instead of mplus
[3:14:48] business_man_alex: Dungeons should scale harder and only have positive affixes
[3:14:49] celimas: have you met wow players? Of course they'd be upset
[3:14:53] Icecoldeskilzz: yoo max when do u think season 3 is gonna end
[3:14:54] Wheva: Fort and Tyran should stay but instead of doing health they should only do damage and keystone level should still be capped
[3:14:57] business_man_alex: 1
[3:14:59] d4_damager_: the affixes need to be tailored to the dungeons, not just put in whether they make sense or not
[3:15:04] DasAutoChat: bring back Wo drifter FeelsBadMan
[3:15:06] atamdev: @atamdev then not playing because there are no affixes would be a you problem too
[3:15:07] Reluctors: also shouldnt be weeks where its just DONT LOG IN weeks lol
[3:15:08] Artheeri: see how chat immediatly recalls seasonals over regular affixes when it comes to that? I think they're very popular if they work and were discarded too easily
[3:15:11] DasAutoChat: wanna be speedy
[3:15:16] business_man_alex: Encrypted was goated
[3:15:18] Jonesing23: bobsamdi affix was dope
[3:15:25] 324bee21: whay if some affixes ere only for ranged or melee?   some are now but really extreme
[3:15:39] Faraday5001: BFA mythic plus was only good in season 4
[3:15:43] eduu9310: bfa last season was SSS tier
[3:15:49] jondbr: @maximum cook a positive affix for us
[3:15:52] RiskelShadowwalker: My take is remove eberything exept t<ranical and fortified + Seasonal affixes (good Sesonals) in weekly rotation
[3:15:57] nightst314: TD? Siege? KR? what are you talking about?
[3:16:15] Krappyboi: The inverted affix idea is fun but you'd have to rethink quite a few things
[3:16:18] Oracle_WoW: @324bee21 that sounds awful. ranged comps just wont play certain weeks
[3:16:20] dango0n: I liked s1 of SL prideful
[3:16:23] Ruinx81: Encrypted was good
[3:16:25] oneifbyland: @RiskelShadowwalker my take is i think some of your keys are broken
[3:16:26] DasAutoChat: people having like 100% haste also made that patch very fun
[3:16:27] Phatori: Legion had the best M+ for 1 reason only. Could create armor sets and swap armor. Was so nice popping on your speed set, then tyrannical boss set, or big AOE set for trash
[3:16:27] DasAutoChat: LUL
[3:16:30] OG_Kawngi: give me shrouded again so I can play with a ton of haste ok
[3:16:31] Ebonhawke7: affixes that just wipe the whole group when you mess them up suck
[3:16:36] business_man_alex: Prideful was awesome
[3:16:45] GrimFandango: They need to be more willing to removing things mid-seasson if their experiments don't work @Maximum
[3:16:45] chauroon: what if seasonals changed weekly like tyran/fort @Maximum
[3:16:45] abelknow: Pride was worst ever
[3:16:48] Wildfire_Gaming: infested xdd
[3:16:52] dango0n: I loved prideful so much
[3:16:58] mantooth11: @RiskelShadowwalker This would be the best. Rotating seasonals would make every week different.
[3:17:14] DasAutoChat: i never played infested LUL
[3:17:15] business_man_alex: I'd rather have banger seasonals 50% of the time then no fun and big affixes
[3:17:19] d4_damager_: i liked junkyard buff robots a lot, i think that was a cool dungeon mechanic
[3:17:24] Perry_TP: beguiling void majority weeks were something for sure
[3:17:33] Alaziara: season 4 was so good
[3:17:36] Krappyboi: I was a pleb and I +2ed a +8 key and stopped playing the rest of season 1 bfa
[3:17:38] antipheonixna: almost like ppl want a positive affix to make their runs more fun each week...
[3:17:41] smolderdaddyuwu: @Maximum do you think at some point they release the last 4 expansions on M+?  like all the dungeons.
[3:17:46] dango0n: I think mages should get kiss affixes and every other spec should get curse affixes
[3:17:54] RiskelShadowwalker: @mantooth11 yeah that would be so good
[3:18:09] jerseyfive: nothing comes close to thundering
[3:18:11] eduu9310: encrypted can be recycled so ez
[3:18:11] Icecoldeskilzz: @Maximum  yo when do u think season 3 is gonna end?
[3:18:12] bramwow: shrouded
[3:18:13] Alaziara: Why don't they just reskin the good ones and bring those back?
[3:18:13] bramwow: was nice
[3:18:14] Vaiilz: Encrypted giga goated
[3:18:15] equinox_flare: THEY SHOULD BRING BACK PRIDEFUL
[3:18:18] Ironshax: omg Encryspted again would make me coom
[3:18:20] Sajtox: thundering was goated
[3:18:24] Haarmless: even thundering was fun
[3:18:25] DasAutoChat: bring uhr and wo back Pog
[3:18:30] business_man_alex: Just make it a vote
[3:18:31] Stubblelad: What if it was just one banger seasonal like affix each week
[3:18:34] AnesthesiaFC: @Sajtox HUH
[3:18:38] d0mezg4mer: ok so we have two, what else?
[3:18:42] Haarmless: @Rizzalicious_ this guy is cooking ^
[3:18:45] Phatori: Just brign back gear swapping.
[3:18:53] SkirsdagTv: Thundering would have been so much better if the damage boost was way more noticble a
[3:18:58] Xanctius: I see a seasonal affix tier list coming up
[3:19:00] antipheonixna: how are u not just describing adding a positive affix
[3:19:02] RiskelShadowwalker: @Maximum Thats what im saying remove all afixes exept tyrnanical and fort. then rotate good sesonals weekly
[3:19:05] business_man_alex: Season 4 is your time to experiment. Throw two seasonal at the wall and see what happens
[3:19:15] business_man_alex: And split them out
[3:19:18] eduu9310: thundering was atrocious
[3:19:25] 324bee21: pride was so good excpt one accidentially pull sucked
[3:19:26] OG_Kawngi: thundering was a stinker
[3:19:32] Krappyboi: speaking of bfa, when's that bfa raid boss tier list coming? @Maximum
[3:19:48] d0mezg4mer: dont think we see seasonals return as long as dungeons are rotating
[3:19:54] Krappyboi: You didn't
[3:19:57] Blloood: Thundering and all X mechanic every 30 sec just makes the mechanic so monotonous and boring.
[3:19:59] Krappyboi: It'll be great
[3:19:59] punkyeti: faithfather when?
[3:20:00] Clevelandmk: is ilvl going to go up in s4? or are we staying at this for the next 12 months
[3:20:00] zeitgeiz: punishment was bad, it sucked at lower levels, it hit you no matter where you were in the dungeon, pugs were horrible
[3:20:02] smolderdaddyuwu: bfa wasnt long ago.. dont say that :(
[3:20:05] delirious152007: when's BFS timewalking coming? >.>
[3:20:09] LazyL1on: @maximum what do you think about an idea to not lower keystone lvl on deplete but instead each keystone has a cooldown on being able to start a dungeon?
[3:20:24] gandalf_wow: but they had a seasonal that was kiss curse in Shadowlands
[3:20:25] d0mezg4mer: agreed just swap between awakened and encrytped we all happy
[3:20:31] jondbr: Orgozoa S tier
[3:20:41] d4_damager_: affixes should be dungeon specific and dungeons rotated more often
[3:20:57] logicaltty: @gandalf_wow all four of them were!
[3:21:18] Saeshal: It would be cool to have 1 positive seasonal affix, like prideful in sl
[3:21:21] jondbr: just rotate in all the seasonals weekly
[3:21:22] Reluctors: @LazyL1on good cook
[3:21:37] Warptime: 25 Warcrest Manor huggge key
[3:21:38] Nekrans: I think Seasonals are an awesome way so separate seasons. In 5 years I'm not gonna remember which dungeons were in rotation DF S2 vs S3
[3:22:02] Thad95: The CD is 30 minutes. ez
[3:22:05] YugeCrit: Seems like a big W
[3:22:07] Stubblelad: What if it was just one banger seasonal like affix each week
[3:22:16] buzwiteyer: could be like ports where it resets after you time another key
[3:22:19] Blloood: thats a horrible idea, forcing players to not play the game is not smart...
[3:22:20] Nearlyinsane: man just explained how to turn wow into a mobile gotcha game
[3:22:26] Ilidas: people would still reroll their keys into the same one so they can spam it. also if your key gets bricked and you don't get invites you are screwed
[3:22:27] blindearth: except when toxic people just deplete a key to cuck the other 4 on CD
[3:22:42] TheBroCrow: nice and quiet Bedge
[3:22:45] Gravixx: let me push affixes specifically damnit
[3:22:52] goblingher: people always say it is going to be MDI but regular people do not have the time to do that degen and today they dont have time for homework keys
[3:23:04] 324bee21: if dungeon 1 and dungeon 8 are 50% different in difficulty that is a huge problem it should be fixed quicker
[3:23:11] Gravixx: for each dungeon let me get different ratings for every affix but make it one big affix instead of 3
[3:23:21] Auphius: would you lockout the person's keystone, or the dungeon instance itself?
[3:23:23] business_man_alex: Man now I want seasonals back
[3:23:24] YugeCrit: its the opposite, your not penalizing people for playing the game
[3:23:33] Blloood: all ur doing is adding an arbritary 30 min break
[3:23:40] SkirsdagTv: I mean, if me and my buds want to sit there and try a 28 BRH for 13 hours straight why cant we?
[3:23:43] Punathebear: Even if you just made the key redoable for a certain length of time after your first attempt. Like if you brick your first attempt, you still have like 3 hours before it depletes so you could reform the group try a new group or take a breather and come back LOL
[3:23:45] business_man_alex: What if you just make a huge seasonal and remove the other affixes
[3:23:46] Blloood: and so many people might just go play another game and not come back in those 30 min
[3:24:00] Sajtox: everbloom is like infinitely harder than atal or brh
[3:24:03] klondike_wow: bonemaw Aware
[3:24:04] dubbyatt: fuck bonemaw
[3:24:05] Durenas: nobody likes it when the devs make a dungeon harder
[3:24:24] „Åø„Çá„Åõ„Å§: B OMEGALUL NEMAW
[3:24:25] OldFlorrysGhost: making dungeons hard at the start makes people quit
[3:24:28] d4_damager_: @Blloood yeah but its better than 4 clowns showing up to some poor guys key and depleting it on first pull then leaving and now the guy has to spend 4 hours pushing the key back up
[3:25:10] 324bee21: but do you want to see players trying to run 2-3 certain keys and just rerolling the other 5 constantly trying to get those 3
[3:25:17] turnipstampede: Bonemaw should be the new seasonal affix, i will not elaborate
[3:25:45] Zarroe: @turnipstampede KEKW
[3:25:51] d4_damager_: @324bee21 just remove reolling and you have to finish the key or something, theres a 1000 ways to fix that problem
[3:26:07] Saeshal: What if they changed the score system and instead of deplete, u lost score instead. Like a pvp ranked system.
[3:26:12] specialsauce_vr: If 1 and 3 are comparable and 3 and 5 are comparable then 1 and 5 are comparable. Thats not possible to be different
[3:26:19] 324bee21: @d4_damager_ true but now that they have given us rerolling I am not sure how taking it away would work
[3:26:25] Zarroe: but hes not gonna baseg
[3:26:25] Sajtox: yes
[3:26:26] treesdesu: EleGiggle
[3:26:26] IMakeMinimumWage: Who knows
[3:26:28] OldFlorrysGhost: every mob is bonemaw
[3:26:28] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[3:26:30] Plexxen92: he will not elaborate
[3:26:31] SkirsdagTv: bonemaw becomes the butcher from d4
[3:26:35] Krappyboi: KEKW
[3:26:35] Haarmless: I named my puppy "bonemaw"
[3:26:38] DasAutoChat: everyboss have an extra bonemaw
[3:26:39] Durenas: bonemaw shows up and throws bones at people
[3:26:39] phyra: BONESTORM
[3:26:39] DasAutoChat: LUL
[3:26:39] LuciFeariUm: bonemaw just HAPPENS
[3:26:41] sethron: oops all bonemaws
[3:26:41] LuciFeariUm: randomly
[3:26:41] Pa1ntank: he just shows up and gives the big suck
[3:26:42] enigmasvea: let him cook xdd
[3:26:42] „Åø„Çá„Åõ„Å§: you get teleported to the bonewmaw boss room randomly and fight the whole thing
[3:26:42] YugeCrit: Bonemaw gang
[3:26:42] infraxtion: he already said he would not elaborate
[3:26:42] celimas: you are bonemaw
[3:26:42] Zarroe: bonemaw everywhere HOLY
[3:26:44] sorliee: There is only one mob and its bonemaw
[3:26:44] Thad95: Butcher affix - Shows up and starts hookin shit
[3:26:45] Sajtox: replace afflicted with bonemaw
[3:26:46] goblingher: Bonemaw should be like Butcher in d4 and just randomly appear and brick your key
[3:26:46] d4_damager_: @d4_damager_ it just has to make sense in the system changes
[3:26:49] RiskelShadowwalker: @Maximum Remove everything exept Tyranical and Fort, rotate weekly, add all the good sesonals make them rotate weekly as well
[3:26:49] szakal_TV: shadownlads s4 affix but its bonemaw instead of demon guy
[3:26:49] panser_nes: its boning time
[3:26:51] Im_Mathiosky: bonemama?
[3:26:53] Lennyakalenny: baseg
[3:26:54] LuciFeariUm: fighting deios and bonemaw fucking whips it out
[3:26:54] logicaltty: it's like shrouded but instead of dreadlords it's bonemaw
[3:26:56] enigmasvea: cook garf
[3:26:58] gwaimag: max is windwalker doomed as well for the war within WHAT DO YOU KNOW
[3:26:58] Mister__Mango: Replace a random dungoen boss with bonemaw
[3:27:00] Wiikz: would be sick ngl
[3:27:02] smolderdaddyuwu: bonedaddy?
[3:27:06] Blloood: There is only one solution, 5 people can que up to a key that is just the dungeon. If you fail the key u lose points if you win you gain points.
[3:27:06] brambledraws: Your teeth are bones, so every mouth is a bonemaw
[3:27:08] Blloood: ez pezy
[3:27:08] TDPandorum: gard
[3:27:08] drall743: the floor is bonemaw
[3:27:17] ghwosttoast: its bonemaw but instead of bonemaw its bonemaw
[3:27:21] oneifbyland: it's actually just a 20-min Bonemaw fight LUL
[3:27:36] d4_damager_: the lich king affix should follow you through the dungeon like in halls of reflection
[3:27:39] Thad95: Losing Points?! PauseChamp
[3:27:40] „Åø„Çá„Åõ„Å§: losing rio monkaW
[3:27:52] tanks66611: we are all bonemaw
[3:27:54] delirious152007: I think there should be a M0 queue
[3:27:55] talync_: that would make keys waaay more toxic
[3:27:57] Saeshal: Losing rio would be so good for the game
[3:27:57] Thad95: Can I token to get more points?
[3:28:00] Durenas: halls of reflection was the GOAT
[3:28:07] goblingher: Holy the temper tantrums people would unleash if they lost rio KEKW
[3:28:08] myst1c1: Elo system is shit always has been shit, don't introduce into this game.
[3:28:08] XadanarGaming: they should introduce solo q for m+ sounds like it would work out alright. probably not timing +25s unless there is a MMR system.
[3:28:13] Plexxen92: rotate halls of reflection into m+ with all RP included
[3:28:15] scars_____: prideful Aware
[3:28:15] Harbringerau: @Maximum what about a penalty for someone leaving a key that can still be timed?
[3:28:20] Haarmless: rotating seasonals is waytoodank
[3:28:23] abelknow: What if we got teragru powers with monsters killed
[3:28:24] Suggoll: what about rotating the dungeon set weekly
[3:28:24] Artheeri: i think keeping tyran isn't the best idea either
[3:28:32] oneifbyland: @Suggoll xdd
[3:28:32] nightst314: people will dodge weeks more often than ever
[3:28:35] Thad95: Fated Keys - Each month is a old seasonal affix
[3:28:36] SuckaFoo: i miss prideful so much
[3:28:37] callmegort: delete spiteful
[3:28:51] Krappyboi: Two rotating seasonals idea from dr. atnos is probably bis
[3:28:52] 324bee21: Rotating seasonals would still create "push weeks," but maybe even more pushy weeks and more weeks people just stopped playing during
[3:29:05] Blloood: and when you que up you can pick 3 specs to priorituse and 3 specs to unprioritise. So the que tries to get you with the classes you prioritise and not with the ones you dont want.
[3:29:15] Durenas: I hope 10.2.6 brings timewalking vanilla naxx.
[3:29:19] GrimFandango: You don't like 8 minute bosses?
[3:29:28] rhsiuol: 8 minute boss fights PepeLaugh
[3:29:32] Zarroe: and then ur cds are back up and you blast again WICKED
[3:29:36] antipheonixna: i mean if u reduce mechanic bloat and let ppl pull bigger, i think u could have a weekly positive affix or seasonal and players would be fine
[3:29:37] XadanarGaming: @Maximum how do we still not have alt catchup system for crests/flightstones? how are we not getting wyrm/aspect from +20s. still have that valor issue of spamming low keys just for crests now instead of loot piece
[3:29:43] LuciFeariUm: i should not get 2 3 minute infernal casts in a dungeon pull
[3:29:48] celimas: alright, solution. Turn boss into bonemaw after 3 minutes. Then you fight bonemaw for 3 minutes. Then it turns back into boss.
[3:29:52] rhsiuol: halls of infusion last boss
[3:30:00] nightst314: no
[3:30:19] nightst314: halls of infusion is bad because gear does not improve the runback
[3:30:30] codethename: Walk into Yalnu room, 6 minutes left okayge feeling good. Wait we're depleting
[3:30:31] LuciFeariUm: @XadanarGaming you trade crests down
[3:30:34] goblingher: Tyr bosses at 25+ feels super boring already
[3:30:34] specialsauce_vr: Teeming is a better fortified than fortified
[3:30:37] DasAutoChat: they can do if you have people doing 0 dmg FeelsBadMan
[3:30:50] Benzoat: Greater rift affix: After 100% mobs you tp to a random 5 man boss for x amount of doungens
[3:30:55] scars_____: maybe add extra mechanics to bosses instead?
[3:30:56] yawgmothsupp: Some blend of capping damage scaling from enemies and letting hp scaling do the timer pressure could be fun
[3:31:08] darkshaid: how about an enrage on bosses of like 5 min? then DPS actaully matters
[3:31:11] menzlo: Do fortified and then half fortified half tyran
[3:31:18] business_man_alex: Tyran is just boring because your WA already tells you when to personal so you just sit there smacking a classic era Raid boss
[3:31:19] MightyBone_Yumuros: really hope they rethink dungeon bosses
[3:31:21] Blloood: Fortified bosses should have HC dungeons mechanics, Tyranical bosses should have Mythic dungeon mechanics (yes they have different mechanics) Tyranical should have the bosses give a bit of score so you can skip more in the dungeon
[3:31:22] d4_damager_: problem with tyrannical and fortified is it makes the enemies unbalancable  because one week they do nothing and the next they destroy you
[3:31:28] Lowpaxd: give every dungeon its own rotating affixes so every key feels fresh every week ratirlBusiness
[3:31:29] „Åø„Çá„Åõ„Å§: @yawgmothsupp i thought this as well
[3:31:33] business_man_alex: My guild flames me Brescia I don't do tyran keys
[3:31:35] Blloood: Add a "talent tree" to m+ where you can pick shroud or lust or whatever
[3:31:36] skeeld: why not just cap the hp increase on bosses?
[3:31:37] Blloood: ez fix
[3:31:38] tanks66611: do you think at a point that higher key need to stop add hp or dps (feel like 25+ are  like 4x as hard as a 20 key )
[3:31:46] treesdesu: NOTED three minutes is all we need
[3:31:54] „Åø„Çá„Åõ„Å§: i think you should race the timer on high keys, not race survivability
[3:31:55] lurthemir: @Maximum Add back seasonals that are available at +21 keys and higher that rotate every 2 weeks, so it's present on both a fort and tyran week, then allow the player to swap out that season for the +14 affix if they want to. This way it affects people primarily in playing for rating, as opposed to gear/low keys.
[3:32:05] goblingher: @Lowpaxd that would be so interesting ngl
[3:32:11] lurthemir: seasonal*
[3:32:13] shawkeem: but all that defeats the purpose for scaling key level, right?
[3:32:13] business_man_alex: Whoa here's a cook. What if they rotate two seasonals instead of tyran and fortified?
[3:32:14] theDirtyon3: @Maximum Max your old your fingers probably start hurting after clicking your buttons for a few minutes
[3:32:22] skeeld: the survival checks are the fun part of higher m+
[3:32:24] skeeld: and that keeps those
[3:32:30] Nekrans: Maybe reduce the timer to compensate for the health time?
[3:32:32] neithoe: Just remove Health scale from the tyr affix and keep dmg.
[3:32:36] LazyL1on: make shields do dmg equal to it‚Äôs size to boss‚Äôs health after it breaks
[3:32:40] Haarmless: make tyrannical weeks spawn bonemaw during boss fights
[3:32:40] Whitewolf1441: lmao
[3:32:41] scars_____: Aware
[3:32:41] business_man_alex: Lol
[3:32:43] theDirtyon3: LUL
[3:32:46] Alarius_: HAH
[3:32:48] xamderdle: huh
[3:32:48] Benjg7: gottem
[3:32:48] GrimFandango: HAH
[3:32:50] celimas: max did you see the picture of lebron's toes?
[3:32:50] LuciFeariUm: HAH
[3:32:51] taxiidk: HAH
[3:32:54] Tsinis: some people want the opposite they want the dungeon determined by timer and damage not  survival
[3:32:55] menzlo: That's when you say ask your mom
[3:32:59] gandalf_wow: what you guys going to do in season 4?
[3:33:08] abelknow: What if the key goes higher and it gets easier
[3:33:25] gandalf_wow: speed raid clear competition?
[3:33:25] business_man_alex: Max what's your wishlist for s4 things they can try to cook on
[3:33:28] treesdesu: NOTED fuck around and find out
[3:33:30] cloudberrylive: best guess of when s4 is
[3:33:34] neithoe: Have you killed mythic fyrakk yet. as dps
[3:33:35] Clevelandmk: we need to see the comback of frostcythe build for frost dk
[3:33:36] gwaimag: max do you think windwalker is getting a rework for next expansion?
[3:33:39] mo736: wasn't on wow for last fated season, was there a rwf?
[3:33:54] Blloood: @Maximum write down every m+ system take and rank them.
[3:34:00] YugeCrit: untested patch kinda Pog
[3:34:01] Durenas: it's gotta be something to do with the brotherhood of the bracelet
[3:34:04] business_man_alex: No rtwf on fated patch
[3:34:08] Krappyboi: I'm guessing 4-5 weeks after 10.2.6 launch
[3:34:09] surfazing_: no shot 10.2.6 is anything else then hardcore for retail
[3:34:14] banana2pwn: what do you think will make it better than the previous fated s4? i will be disappointed if its a straight copy and paste
[3:34:16] Stubblelad: How about nix affixes but have like 4 weekly dungeon rotations, def wont get boring doing new dungeons each week
[3:34:19] Nekrans: Wait is boned auto modded?
[3:34:27] Lowpaxd: @maximum give every dungeon its own rotating affixes so every key feels fresh every week ratirlBusiness
[3:34:30] business_man_alex: We're still progging tindrisil so we're hoping for a may patch
[3:34:38] OldFlorrysGhost: no raid affixes
[3:34:41] skeeld: do some crazy shit
[3:34:43] skeeld: make it nutty
[3:34:43] oneifbyland: @surfazing_ that's a weird hill to die on
[3:34:46] Cynleth: so season 3 ends around april or may?
[3:34:47] WowGrandma78: thats a long wait for season 4 but im sure your right
[3:34:47] Yagr6: fated firelands with current tuning

[3:35:30] delirious152007: S4 "Boss Rush Mode" ?
[3:35:34] abelknow: Yessss better mythic lockout
[3:35:36] smolderdaddyuwu: max wants to sell more mythic
[3:35:45] theDirtyon3: I want every raid brought up to modern standards with new gear Kappa
[3:35:46] tanks66611: i got a odd ideal what if each dung it more random like some pull will have 1 more add and other less

[3:54:55] TDPandorum: Watch TDH do now just out of spite XD
[3:54:56] 4nn4n45: imagine firedup stirring the controller
[3:54:57] grimzero617: @maximum  Team Liquid les mis when?  THD is Javert, yeah?
[3:54:59] celimas: even in classic, pvp would be hell
[3:54:59] oneifbyland: yea but the story of how that player got into your raid in the ffirst place would be priceless
[3:54:59] CommonJD: What if they're playing scrollwheel bear tho?
[3:55:00] kellarXO: I've seen people raid BFD with steam deck
[3:55:00] mo736: assuming classic wow keeps going, at what point would you think liquid seriously participates in the rwf? MoP onwards?
[3:55:01] TDPandorum: THD*
[3:55:02] OG_Kawngi: Zaelia could heal with a controller
[3:55:04] zaackes: killing boss with controller can be something for a charity race haha
[3:55:04] zylverb0x: that's a completely different thing tho. playing controller on your couch would be casual no matter what
[3:55:08] Squats3: i used it for my 9 year old son to make it easier to play classic

[3:55:20] wuyubohehe: I can play mc using my phone
[3:55:22] rhaggs4: What if it was firedup on the controller
[3:55:23] Alaziara: what about that mage that does dances and rp's his abilities?
[3:55:23] celimas: yeah, rofl, imagine THD shows up to the next raid and is like "guys, I'm only gonna use the numpad for this tier"
[3:55:28] Klayjamin: Need an undercover where you run into a controller player
[3:55:32] nickelvc: @Squats3 your son is an friggin gamer
[3:55:36] Slapsstick: growl did a SL coaching of a hpal playing on controller in a NW, honestly its much more intuitive than I expected. Definitely not optimal tho, especially in raid
[3:55:41] iTsGRANT: I am currently 3.2k io & 4/9 M on a ps4 controller, no compatibility mods. There are too many targeting issues to be on WF level content.
[3:55:45] dolgare: I mean classic is simple enough you could probably play it on a NES controller
[3:55:52] abelknow: Can Max do a bankai

[3:56:16] Aethel12: but what would he do instead
[3:56:22] stumie: average artifact power grinder enjoyer mentality
[3:56:23] iridae: THD is such an archetype
[3:56:23] teddyg55: THD still has artifact power to farm
[3:56:25] theDirtyon3: @Maximum yo you see that chick in Arkansas that got stuck in the Top Golf netting?
[3:56:31] Krappyboi: I mean he is the islands goblin so it all makes sense

[3:58:08] Virridian: salute
[3:58:12] FieldMedic_Feywyn: You should though.
[3:58:14] Klayjamin: Undercover would be dope
[3:58:15] Plexxen92: from an ergonomic perspective, a controller is better. Combined with more buttons and some footpedals, it could actually be deadly
[3:58:20] pagog0: yessss undercover raid
[3:58:21] Klayjamin: salute
[3:58:22] AndyBoyLIVE: do an undercover with a controller

[3:58:44] Shimorta: have you made predictions for what you think 10.2.6 is gonna be? just the yolo ?
[3:58:47] psyphen443: I am fully quadriplegic from a spinal cord injury. Able to play at a reasonable level (20s and first few mythic bosses), but only way I can play is with xbox adaptive controller and mouse. Very happy to be able to play, but interface a little buggy using controller and mouse
[3:58:48] Virridian: Your body will tell you unfortunately oldage
[3:59:20] TDPandorum: Next season, IM hard cooking on builds in terms of talents and gear.
[3:59:28] whiskeyhide: its gonna be open sea pirate battles
[3:59:29] abelknow: You should bang roids
[3:59:32] Krappyboi: timerunning is 10.2.7

[4:00:41] mershme: Challenge mode deadmines
[4:00:45] Squats3: Hardcore was mostly a streamer thing. shit died as soon as the streamers stopped playing
[4:00:46] Slapsstick: no M+ and no mythic raiding o7
[4:00:47] zylverb0x: maybe the last season is going to be free because df is over.
[4:00:50] breadwilton: hardcore in general is boring af

[4:00:57] Xanctius: takes 2 minutes to swipe
[4:00:58] Krappyboi: hardcore retail just sounds bad
[4:01:21] Squats3: @Maximum kungen cleared all of the raid content in hardcore i believe. must all be easy
[4:01:25] scars_____: hardcore didnt die
[4:01:26] celimas: that's like objectively false?
[4:01:26] breadwilton: hc retail would be so lazy

[4:01:39] celimas: I have a friend that still raids in hardcore every week
[4:01:45] xxx_dagron_xxx: It's just not a large enough community.  Folks follow the newer stuff like SOD, new retail content, etc.

[4:02:30] KaisenSiru: Classic PepeLaugh
[4:02:41] holdenwook: classic is sort of a confused space right now, with wotlk, hardcore and sod all competing for player time
[4:02:42] Arvakr: Are u going to play Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the demo just came out
[4:02:43] Doimos89: Yea because there's no content in classic so they are on twitter, retail people are playing the game
[4:02:53] abelknow: It's fun to watch them crash and burn
[4:02:55] oneifbyland: classic will go up later this week until ppl hit 40 by Saturday and then afk till season 4
