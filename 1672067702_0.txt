[5:21:06] ghosted_waffle: its DEF
[5:21:07] TotalTunt: ad-blu?
[5:21:12] macleod29: Diesel exhaust fluid
[5:21:14] GamingWithWood: diesel exhaust fluid
[5:21:17] jazontdi: ya def maybe
[5:21:18] Dimeric: It is to break the diesel particles
[5:21:19] macleod29: It’s for your dpf and def filter
[5:21:21] ghosted_waffle: its to control the emissions
[5:21:28] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[5:21:28] Tordrek_: its because diesel is dirty
[5:21:29] jazontdi: newer diesel engines use that now
[5:21:30] georgx77: DEF worst thing ever i deleted it off mine but some states you cant
[5:21:31] macleod29: Makes it so your exhaust burns clean and dosent harm the environment
[5:21:42] ghosted_waffle: DONT POUR IT IN YOUR TANK! lol it will ruin your engine
[5:21:58] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[5:21:58] GamingWithWood: it  cools a ceramic unit that super heats exhaust and burns it off and no black smoke
[5:22:05] ghosted_waffle: only put it in the DEF tank
[5:22:08] jazontdi: DEF system is hard on new diesel motor but its for cleaner exhaust
[5:22:24] jazontdi: if you dont have emmissions its not bad idea to remove or delete
[5:22:41] Symbianto: @Swifty what are u using for the fart on the screen
[5:22:58] StreamElements: Swifty is Partnered with Corsair! Click here to see all their cool stuff! https://cor.sr/Swifty

[5:23:54] xsilentsnowmanx: Def fluid isnt that great i would personally look into deleteing it
[5:24:19] Tordrek_: its good for the environment..
[5:24:23] issayata: Removing emission equipment
[5:24:53] issayata: Who cares about standards! It's much healthier for longevity of the vehicle
[5:24:56] georgx77: yours being new, you need to wait since it would void your warranty
[5:24:58] SgtShiv: could lead to loss of truck or paying to reinstall
[5:25:02] jazontdi: ya its just an extra straw for the engine to breathe through its ok but its more maintenance down the long road
[5:25:07] jts9377: i have a 2018 ram 2500 cummins fully deleted and its amazing
[5:25:22] macleod29: It means you delete the dpf filter and exhaust basically you take out the dpf exhaust and put in a different exhaust. Everyone deletes there diesel trucks because the dpf and def systems are junk and fail all the time costing 1000’s in repairing them
[5:25:30] issayata: Where I live there are no inspections or issues with being deleted. It's nice.
[5:25:32] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Forgiven - Original Mix by Orician -> https://prtzl.io/jDHWaKOokY42yZu1
