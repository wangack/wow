[0:43:26] kodtheog: Sweating ur ass off for 2 chest then getting nothing but anima
[0:43:27] Lunar_fangz: yupp 30 min runs dor some anima most of the time
[0:43:34] Lunar_fangz: for*
[0:43:44] kodtheog: Its bad
[0:44:02] kodtheog: its so bad that I basically just do 10 keys then call it for the week
[0:44:09] kodtheog: for vault right now
[0:44:12] deerp_tv: They should of kept bonus rolls if destroying the loot system lol
[0:44:12] xachilles420: @kaeod where i can check Patch nozes
[0:44:16] MrGattz: wow you still do 10? i stopped at 4
[0:44:19] kodtheog: wowhead if they happen
[0:44:22] MrGattz: fuck running 10 keys for nothing
[0:44:25] kodtheog: yeah
[0:44:27] kodtheog: I should
[0:44:37] herblex: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[0:44:44] kodtheog: Im thinking of quitting keys altogether lmao just do 1 big key a week
[0:44:46] Lunar_fangz: im poretty sure ion was interviewed and acknowledged it was an issue at least
[0:44:50] kodtheog: So boring
[0:45:07] kodtheog: Its horribly unrewarding
[0:45:09] deerp_tv: sure would hope he acknowledged it fuck man
[0:45:13] Lunar_fangz: it was on wowhead i just cant remember his response
[0:45:23] deerp_tv: give me valor point system for M+ to buy gear like PVP gear
[0:45:27] kodtheog: if im not gonna get loot give me 250 anima for a 3 chested key
[0:45:37] kodtheog: @deerp_tv yess bro that would be awesome
[0:45:50] letrickyxd: Right? Even if I don't get loot from M+, let M+ be the stackable way to farm anima
[0:45:52] kodtheog: Use valor points to upgrade our m+ gear or buy gear
[0:45:56] Lunar_fangz: or the loot forgiveness like the legion legendaries. yeh they have alot of options
[0:46:16] kodtheog: lets hope we see some changes today
[0:46:22] kodtheog: we can only hope boys
[0:46:22] letrickyxd: Anima is also just a pain in the ass, 25k for colour swap cove gear and 10k+ for sanctum upgrades
[0:46:33] kodtheog: Right
[0:46:41] kodtheog: I only upgraded command table full
[0:46:44] deerp_tv: like give the PVE players something here! literally went from forcing PVP players to play PVE in BFA and now PVE players forced to PVP for gear makes 0 sense lol and @kaeod right would be dope if they incorporated that
[0:46:45] kodtheog: Its the most rewarding
[0:46:51] kodtheog: By far
[0:46:55] letrickyxd: I want the travel to max on my alts, so i get the portal to Oribos
[0:46:58] Thoreya: idt ive done a sanctum upgrade in a month
[0:47:00] Thoreya: lmao
[0:47:07] kodtheog: same
[0:47:11] kodtheog: I got 10k anima
[0:47:13] MrGattz: the worst part is this is the easiest change in the world for blizzard. take the pvp vender, hit copy, paste it somewhere near by, change the dudes name, and change the currency from honor/conquest to valor from wotlk. add token drops to bosses.
[0:47:20] xachilles420: cant find Patch notes
[0:47:21] Thoreya: shit is irrelevant to me pretty much
[0:47:23] kodtheog: Then upgraded command table fin full
[0:47:27] Towelliee: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1351491338391449600 Morning all on in 5 minutes retweet like fam it up for raggy
[0:47:37] kodtheog: ‚ù§Ô∏è morning towe
[0:47:38] deerp_tv: EXACTLYYY @MrGattz
[0:47:47] Enzze: love u bro
[0:47:51] kodtheog: love u brodie
[0:48:06] Thoreya: blizz just isnt big fans of mythic plus
[0:48:10] Thoreya: thats my honest opinion
[0:48:11] Enzze: @kaeod no I love u
[0:48:14] kodtheog: They arent
[0:48:14] Thoreya: but we'll nerver know
[0:48:15] letrickyxd: Yeah, I love M+ in Legion and BFA, and I would surely like it in SL too, but it feels just so shitty about the systems on it that I don't
[0:48:20] kodtheog: Its evident they arent
[0:48:36] kodtheog: pvp got a lot of love but m+ has no vendor
[0:48:40] kodtheog: Makes no sense
[0:48:49] Thoreya: raid and pvp have been a staple since 04 and i think its hard for them to think of m+ the same as the other 2
[0:48:54] deerp_tv: I mean clearly @Thoreya they fucking destroyed it this expac..besides not being rewarding with the loot system...its not even fun anymore
[0:49:03] MrGattz: they cant not be fans of it they have an entire esports division for it
[0:49:06] letrickyxd: I think they might've justg not realised about M+ being really good BECAUSE of TFing. Now that's gone, and they just only took stuff away from it
[0:49:13] letrickyxd: Hopefully they leearnt their lesson with that
[0:49:15] kodtheog: Just make it so we can upgrade our levels of m+ gear by getting points
[0:49:17] Thoreya: the esports divison for m+
[0:49:20] kodtheog: its not hard
[0:49:21] Thoreya: is dying pretty quick
[0:49:43] deerp_tv: I mean how much do they care about their e sports when one of the best tanks in the world is opting out of MDI after this cup because he makes more playing PoE lol
[0:50:02] kodtheog: Cuz m+ is boring and the loot is trash also the io system is dreadful
[0:50:25] MrGattz: @Thoreya yeah.. well thats what happens when you dont take care of something.
[0:50:26] mario32: !soon

[0:50:45] kodtheog: i love love this xpac but i cant stand how bad of a place m+ feels compared to raid loot/pvp gear
[0:51:18] deerp_tv: yea this expac would be GOAT status if it wasnt for the M+ and gearing system
[0:51:31] matugm: They're not trying to make a perfect game, they just want you to keep playing for as long as possible so you pay for your sub. When they see subs drops they will do something about PVE loot.
[0:51:37] kodtheog: ^
[0:51:44] kodtheog: Thats how it always goes

[1:17:35] nixxy_7: and since blizzard is activision now... activision only cares about is Money and how to make more money... so activision will take 99% everytim
[1:17:54] pereadin: I would only hope that esports orgs would take over their average monthly income if they did but I doubt that would ever happen.
[1:18:03] pereadin: average monthly streaming income*
[1:18:30] kiksa4401: im pretty sure they wew pulling more viewers on twitch than youtube atm
[1:19:00] pereadin: I think it will. He ONLY plays games to compete. If he sees no value from a strict competitive aspect that might open up the eyes for other people.
[1:19:01] nixxy_7: @Towelliee i am already seeing the future... BLizzard adds the DMCA rule to streaming wow to get 30-50% cut from what streamers make.... i can already see the nightmares in the future..

[1:57:29] swampt1l: Momma said she‚Äôs the devil
[1:57:30] sotsil_: @Towelliee Thats my issue with my guild too. PPL show up no tacts no extra effort not even Maw rep and expect to be told everything and they wants bosses to die.Thats how players quit.
[1:57:30] Slafer383: @Towelliee my dh tank is 190, what you think the max key i can do now? playing pretty well
[1:57:36] StateFarm206: The gear that comes out for raid is trash lol
[1:57:48] aikopooh: shadowlands was beside raids it was so alt friendly but know its like gatto do stuff with renown stuff
[1:57:50] pereadin: I was honestly expecting Legion revamped with the changes we expected they learned from.
[1:57:54] StateFarm206: you can hit 2100 in RBGS and get better gear then mythic raiders xd
[1:57:55] DeanoTV: Feels like every1 is burning out on wow :/
[1:58:04] aikopooh: was friendly to alts btw
[1:58:13] Wildsmasher: gear to slow

[1:58:14] Hank_ish: for shaman why do we get spritwalkers grace at 44 but the talent Graceful Spirit at 40???
[1:58:16] StateFarm206: they need to make mythic ilvl 15s higher
[1:58:18] Wildsmasher: i hate pvp
[1:58:25] storm99413: friendly to alt but not with gear drop tho
[1:58:40] Manabucho: im just hoping for that valor vendor :/
[1:58:42] DeanoTV: done 6 m0 dungeons on my alt on got 1 piece of gear FailFish
[1:58:53] swampt1l: 210 is pretty trash @statefarm__206
[1:58:54] Pojotmc: m+ feels significantly worse this expansion, and it was one of the main reasons i play
[1:59:02] blightanker: SD NEEDS NERF @Towelliee
[1:59:08] Sollice: Morning everyone
[1:59:11] swampt1l: The boss that is bad is the 2nd one
[1:59:15] kowaikoro: m+ end of dungeon loot is capped at 210 KEKW
[1:59:18] swampt1l: Other then that it‚Äôs an easy key
[1:59:19] Thoreya: they can do it rn before the cup
[1:59:20] Lofire303: I mean wasn't the conversation with Preach the other day directly reguarding to the timegate of gear to help make sure the dev team has time for next major patch?
[1:59:22] NateEpicsaurus: Im sad that BM is bottom spec in pve.. but its a fun class
[1:59:31] sphynx_rayne: I can't get in to M+ :( I can't get gear it's like WTF
[1:59:31] NateEpicsaurus: bm hunter
[1:59:37] sussyrev: typical for the wow community: Begs for lesser gear drops and more meaningful gear---> Bitches about not getting gear
[1:59:43] whamtv: It‚Äôs literally been the exact opposite for like the last 2 xpacs. PVPers have had to PVE to stay relevant, especially in BfA when there were no vendors @towelliee
[1:59:46] itsyeboar: What is the 'OP shit'?
[1:59:47] goatjohnson: what is the wa for the mission table?
[1:59:49] StateFarm206: @SwapT1_ yeah for how hard some 15s are and getting 210 is aweful
[1:59:56] MaX_DutchyW: Why is always 1 Classspec Good like why cant all the specs be good
[2:00:10] swampt1l: Wow players complain about everything @revanite20
[2:00:29] tarot_with_tricia: Today is my birthday and I'm older than Toweliee
[2:00:30] Aervyper: @Towelliee i am ilvl 205 atm. I am pretty proud of that. I'm on my own little mountain top..... The idea of getting to 215 -220 is so bat crazy daunting for my mind that i'm happy ontop of my little hill
[2:00:31] sussyrev: true swap
[2:00:40] diasterrr: @DeanoTV mate i did 15 dungeons and 10 of it was Necrotic Wake ( that has 3 bis item for warrior weapon/ring/head ) i only got the ring and that i didnt drop myself , i got it from trade !!
[2:00:40] TStitches: Blizz logic "Boomies OP better nerf Rog's"
[2:00:42] Lichcult: it's almost like this is an MMO...
[2:00:42] swampt1l: @statefarm__206 yeah it‚Äôs terrible man
[2:00:48] Ertra: @miss_beautiful_mama happy birthday!
[2:00:49] Lichcult: it takes time haha
[2:01:03] tarot_with_tricia: @miss_beautiful_mama thank you!
[2:01:09] sphynx_rayne: I don't hate shadowlands. But It's meh right now with gear and stuff. I'm not hating on the games. it's just not 110% for me
[2:01:19] kodtheog: @towelliee but how come they were so quick to fix rogues and not other broken shit
[2:01:34] AvarexTV: Nothing wrong with slower gearing imo
[2:01:36] Thoreya: oh please PVE fuckin memes pvp players all the time lmao
[2:01:43] Lichcult: pvp has got the shaft for years though
[2:01:44] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee we are also a year into covid, people are burnt out from working from home and constant stress.
[2:01:45] diasterrr: true
[2:01:46] StateFarm206: You should not have to force people to pvp if you dont wanna do it
[2:01:50] Pallananana: PVP not being in the shitter for 1 god damn expansion KEKW
[2:01:59] sotsil_: @slow yes No gear on 20 bosses isnt the way
[2:01:59] Thoreya: pve players try to belittle pvp players and shit
[2:02:00] Aervyper: @Towelliee i am ilvl 205 atm. I am pretty proud of that. I'm on my own little mountain top..... The idea of getting to 215 -220 is so bat crazy daunting for my mind that i'm happy ontop of my little hill
[2:02:00] MaX_DutchyW: PVP kinda braindead tho LUL
[2:02:13] outset_: @Max_Dutchy how so?
[2:02:14] MainlyHigh: i mean if ran keys with people with that pvp gear and tbh my 217 ilvl shaman out dps them in almost every key i run
[2:02:26] CADZtv: @Lichcult pve is also the dominate factor for the game
[2:02:32] Amarlian: there is a balance between slow gearing and content feeling rewarding
[2:02:32] whamtv: An add popped up when your responded to my chat post SADGE @towelliee :(
[2:02:38] mobbo: Vers sucks for some people
[2:02:41] KingsandClubs: Getting 1 loot per heroic clear shouldn‚Äôt be happening at least 2 should be a minimum
[2:02:46] StateFarm206: then the pvpers try and do keys or raid and they are like 220 and cant do dps cause they are ass in pve lol
[2:02:49] Slafer383: For me, I dont like the idea ilvl I am grinding will be de-valued when next patch hit.
[2:02:51] sphynx_rayne: I know what I want in the game. But i know blizzard don't know me XD so I get what i get in the game. If i don't like it i don't login
[2:03:11] StateFarm206: @KingsandClubs try getting 0 loot for 2 weeks out of heroic
[2:03:13] rhodeini: hey bro
[2:03:15] swampt1l: He will pump then wings fall off and hit like a noddle LUL
[2:03:17] kodtheog: @whamtv he said just cuz pvp is good doesn‚Äôt mean pve needs to get no love considering 90% of blizzard playerbase does pve

[2:03:25] Lichcult: @JAYMURCS that's because pvp got destroyed ...of course it's the dominant factor after several expansions killed that part of the game
[2:03:33] KingsandClubs: @statefarm__206 actually 0 loot or loot that you already have?
[2:03:40] CADZtv: @Lichcult no your not understanding my point
[2:03:45] StateFarm206: @KingsandClubs my mage went 2 weeks without geting an item
[2:03:48] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee do you think that they slowed down progression too much? They might have overcompensated because they thought people would be playing a lot more due to covid
[2:03:55] CADZtv: @Lichcult PVE has always been the reason WHY people play MMO
[2:04:01] KingsandClubs: @statefarm__206 with a full clear?
[2:04:05] swampt1l: @statefarm__206 yeah bro I did 7 bosses on normal and got nothing
[2:04:17] CADZtv: @Lichcult name me one successful pvp mmo
[2:04:22] Cypfer: @SwapT1_ 20 in HC 1 item
[2:04:22] Lichcult: @JAYMURCS your point is not correct though, and that is not completely true. in vanilla/tbc it was not one sided. pvp was just as healthy as pve.
[2:04:23] Annkay: They did say they were looking into it.
[2:04:27] StateFarm206: @KingsandClubs 18 bosses since my guild cant kill the last boss lol
[2:04:33] CADZtv: @Lichcult my point is correct
[2:04:35] sphynx_rayne: @Towelliee do you think if gearing was like BFA people would be happy?
[2:04:35] itsyeboar: I dont think they should increase teh drop chance in dungeons (since they are farmable). Raid drops are on the lower side IMO.
[2:04:38] DeanoTV: They should add a valor vendor and bonus rolls
[2:04:49] swampt1l: @cypfer it sucks man
[2:04:59] KingsandClubs: I think it‚Äôs impossible to do a full clear and only get anima but i might be wrong
[2:05:00] Lichcult: @JAYMURCS nice ego lol
[2:05:13] Thoreya: cant wait for a month to people bitch about getting too much loot and filling up bags
[2:05:17] Lichcult: @JAYMURCS i can tell ur a new player
[2:05:18] Thoreya: like bfa
[2:05:18] swampt1l: Lost my mind couple days ago
[2:05:21] Thoreya: and itll be a clown show again
[2:05:23] CADZtv: @Lichcult i mean bro i can say yo have an ego to

[2:05:30] Fades1209: gear being slow is fine, the problem is that other ways to get gear are better and faster.
[2:05:33] itsyeboar: @Thoreya ++
[2:05:33] Shakespade: which interview are you refering? i wanna read :)
[2:05:38] CADZtv: @Lichcult i mean ive been play for 12 years
[2:05:45] CADZtv: @Lichcult nice assumption
[2:05:53] swampt1l: @thoreya 2 pieces of gear per dungeon is fucking garbo
[2:05:55] sphynx_rayne: We got other 4 years of shadowlands. So I'm not going crazy right now just playing
[2:06:02] CADZtv: @Lichcult and ive also played other mmos for 122 years
[2:06:04] Lichcult: @JAYMURCS been playing blind apparently
[2:06:08] Ardailec: It might have worked if PvP vendors didn't exist.
[2:06:11] deerp_tv: !missiontable
[2:06:14] CADZtv: @Lichcult pve has always been the dominate population
[2:06:18] Thoreya: @SwapT1_ just keep it consistent

[2:06:26] deerp_tv: what's his mission table addon?

[2:06:53] Thoreya: they literally changed the looting for shadowlands bc people complained in bfa the whole time
[2:06:54] Thoreya: ??????
[2:06:56] RocketMan23: @deerp_tv Venture Table
[2:06:59] StateFarm206: you can pvp for 1 day on a fresh 60 and get full 197 gear
[2:07:05] TheS1mple: I think it's great
[2:07:06] deerp_tv: @RocketMan23 thanks
[2:07:17] sphynx_rayne: Blizzard fans bitch??? :O i'm shocked!
[2:07:19] swampt1l: They just need to change to 3 pieces again @thoreya
[2:07:19] RocketMan23: @deerp_tv its not on curse you just have to google it to get the download
[2:07:26] azzurrin: People wanted to go back to the way classic loot dropped, and now they're complaining, LMAO
[2:07:34] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee I would argue that people are playing more. That also presents the idea that people would be even less happy if they were playing a regular amount
[2:07:35] CritcobainTV: I wanna stay up and watch you but fuck me I'm ready to pass out
[2:07:38] SorionTheGinger: @azzurrin who wanted that?
[2:07:38] deerp_tv: okay thanks
[2:07:39] kodemonkee: @statefarm__206 random bgs or rated arena/bgs?
[2:07:47] swampt1l: DansGame dude @critcobain
[2:07:55] StateFarm206: @kodemonkee you just do random bgs and upgrade the honor gear
[2:07:59] CritcobainTV: @SwapT1_ Wut..?
[2:08:00] CADZtv: @Lichcult btw you do realise in vanila and tbc wow is still so brand new right KEKW
[2:08:09] CADZtv: was*

[2:08:27] swampt1l: Just giving you shit LOL get some sleep bro @critcobain
[2:08:29] CritcobainTV: @SwapT1_ i should've but a comma, I didn't mean butt fuck, i mean but, fuck me im tired basically
[2:08:32] CritcobainTV: LUL
[2:08:45] Artivicii: dat priest KEKW
[2:08:50] CritcobainTV: I spent 4 hours doing mythic 0 carries for gold.... it took 4 hours to clear 8 cause my 188 ret pally was top damage FeelsBadMan

[2:11:25] Affiiance: It has gotten a lot more people back into PvP tbh, our guild is actually having fun with it now
[2:11:30] sphynx_rayne: I love PVP but i don't have friends to do 2s and 3s lol
[2:11:34] biirrd: A token / point system for m+ like in pvp, is the best way forward. Like pvp, if you "unlock" m+10 ex. you can buy/upgrade 207 gear, and so on. Best way.
[2:11:45] swampt1l: As THD said people will miss Titanforging Kappa
[2:11:50] StateFarm206: People didn't like valor because they actually had to play the game KEKW
[2:12:06] damigeINC: I miss being able to reforge stats =/
[2:12:08] Rottencoarse: explosive
[2:12:09] Rottencoarse: again

[2:12:52] diklikeatunacan: Xilly means submissive in Portugese
[2:12:54] diasterrr: @sphynx_rayne same , its alot harder to do it alone with other players
[2:13:01] 3v3r35t_: Maybe a way to upgrade m+ gear like pvp gear? Based on your m+ lvl/rating?!
[2:13:03] jake_lampy: It‚Äôs 7 there? It‚Äôs reset at 9?
[2:13:07] ChoboToss: @Towelliee the only bad part of Throne of Thunder was it started that horrid "Thunderforged" item trend that carried all the way through BFA

[2:13:30] Thoreya: definitely aint m+ by blizz standards
[2:13:34] klaymiester: smile, you're on the front page
[2:13:35] DarthLemon: i came to wow to escape pvp
[2:13:37] Thoreya: apparently
[2:13:45] sphynx_rayne: @diasterrr PVP is so much fun. But it better with one or two friends XD
[2:13:45] StateFarm206: @itsyeboar no lol because pvp is a small fraction of this game
[2:13:47] Captn_Coco: Same as society irl.
[2:13:55] jake_lampy: Honestly love PvP
[2:13:56] Artivicii: @3V3R357 raiderio is 3rd party tho, would like to see blizz implement their own rating system for m+ for sure tho
[2:13:58] Pallananana: WoW battle pet gearing system when? BabyRage
[2:13:59] Lichcult: vanilla it is arguable that it was as important as pve
[2:14:07] itsyeboar: No, but its still in the game right? Like I disagree that it should be the main way.
[2:14:08] itsyeboar: Correct
[2:14:09] Lunar_fangz: the player base isnt equal tho so priority shouldnt be imo
[2:14:19] itsyeboar: It should be balanced out.
[2:14:20] lukee_ar: correct.
[2:14:22] jake_lampy: Top rank pvp is easily top pve
[2:14:24] lukee_ar: i respect that
[2:14:26] Rottencoarse: healer died
[2:14:27] Rottencoarse: lol
[2:14:34] sphynx_rayne: I think there should be both pvp and pve
[2:14:35] kowaikoro: is my man actually running 0 vers?
[2:14:36] theoriginalzinng: holy priest problems
[2:14:37] Artivicii: you people? DansGame
[2:14:37] itsyeboar: But, don't think it should be the other way around either
[2:14:40] PToastman: Lol
[2:14:41] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee I feel like if pvp is giving this much gear, mythics should drop up to 213 and 1 more piece of loot for timign and untiming
[2:14:43] StateFarm206: i seen some high rated PVPers suck in raids KEKW
[2:14:46] CritcobainTV: and it would even out
[2:14:48] whamtv: I just hate pve, so having to do it to gear in PvP sucks. As long as I can gear without having to PVE, I‚Äôm happy
[2:14:50] PToastman: Maybe he‚Äôs angel spec
[2:14:53] Jsibs: Its the fact that pvp gear has always been harder to get and pvers say getover it. now its on the other hand and pvers are bitchign
[2:14:57] PToastman: Kappa
[2:15:03] Affiiance: Its like Ion said, if you want to be fully geared out you should play ALL aspects of the game
[2:15:11] ChoboToss: Priest is just getting Spirit of Red value
[2:15:13] Syllvn: Honestly, I wish TF was still in, just with 'brackets' so LFR isn't proccing mythic gear but some RNG in there so they up the loot drops.
[2:15:16] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee They're all calculated deaths for the healing in angel form for no mana cost Kappa
[2:15:18] Thunderbrew: It's WoW. People complain no matter what
[2:15:44] itsyeboar: @Affiiance It does make it challenging. Not sure if I agree. But do not disagree either. Think I'm in the middle there.
[2:15:47] ijuki: I think everyone is forgetting the explosive
[2:15:51] Thoreya: maybe we'll see better players over the course of shadowlands bc people have to pvp
[2:15:54] StateFarm206: They need to fix mythic plus loot because it feels aweful to do more then 4 a week
[2:15:55] Thoreya: wud be nice

[2:16:16] Artivicii: @statefarm__206 ive done like 40 this week KEKW
[2:16:27] StateFarm206: @Artivicii and got 1 item KEKW xd
[2:16:34] MILESkg21: ^^ KEKW
[2:16:38] diasterrr: @sphynx_rayne it is fun , and it is respectable , but the thing is when you dont have anyone to play with you reach to the point that you kinda wanna give up on doing so because you progress so bad and slow that you start hating it, obviously there is a point behind playing arenas you dont just do it without caring about rating , thats not fun , its alot more fun when you care about rating , caus you literally learn and get better because of caring about it
[2:16:41] Artivicii: 2 KEKW
[2:16:49] Pallananana: Wall of text D:
[2:16:51] Artivicii: literally 2 KEKWait
[2:16:52] StateFarm206: @Artivicii Ruff lol
[2:16:53] dreamwalker213: @thoreya being forced to pvp doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean people are gonna get better at the game. A lot of pvpers suck in raid and vice versa
[2:17:01] Protosynx: word wall WutFace
[2:17:10] Pallananana: And it's not even copy pasta D:
[2:17:13] Thoreya: @bmackin213 theyll prob know how to interrupt
[2:17:24] Thoreya: which ill take lol
[2:17:32] kowaikoro: just wait for 9.3 when all the issues are solved Kappa
[2:17:33] Affiiance: I mean I think a lot of players are enjoying Shadowlands
[2:17:41] itsyeboar: @Towelliee How do you feel about the drop chances of dungeons though?
[2:17:48] dreamwalker213: @thoreya lmao fair statement
[2:17:49] nixxy_7: dont type 1000 million words in a text some people didnt got they`re cofee yet its to morning to read that all... be simple and concise to the point
[2:18:00] MILESkg21: playing Slands while waiting for Lost Ark and Ashes
[2:18:08] sphynx_rayne: @diasterrr I just hate that we have to do 2s and 3s but i get it. I'm trying to just enjoy playing lol
[2:18:09] Affiiance: If they put the PvP gearing system in M+ all is fixed right?
[2:18:13] kazzthekeeper: the argument isnt nerf PVP loot its buff PVE loot
[2:18:15] PadidinJones: Mistakes were made!
[2:18:21] Sandisy: makes you wonder when he'll be replaced. the guys ideas never work out LUL
[2:18:23] whamtv: I honestly don‚Äôt want them to make PVE have to PVP to gear, cause that‚Äôs what it has been for us. I just want them to keep it all separate.
[2:18:26] NplusK: Plus, Vers is on every pvp piece. So it‚Äôs basically just an ilvl stick
[2:18:37] Thoreya: wait so do we want m+ to have a btter system than pvp now
[2:18:39] Thoreya: or equal
[2:18:41] diasterrr: @sphynx_rayne you mean for gearing up ?
[2:18:43] DeanoTV: They should add a valor vendor and bonus rolls.
[2:18:46] StateFarm206: Make mythic 15s loot better is all i want and for loot to drop more in raids
[2:18:51] SyrothTV: @Towelliee you think the next raid tier will end the pvp season? that way pve has a chance to gear past pvp?
[2:18:54] PadidinJones: Or not! or not...
[2:18:55] OnePlayerPete: People need to remember that Blizzard are in the business of making money, therefore they're going to make sure you're subbed for as long as possible.
[2:18:56] Thoreya: bc there shud be no reason why m+ shud have a better gearing system than arena lmao
[2:19:10] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[2:19:14] StateFarm206: like why do a mythic raid when you can pvp and get better loot KEKW
[2:19:16] Affiiance: Obviously a valor vendor instead of conq... and M+ gear instead of PvP gear LUL
[2:19:32] DeanoTV: @Affiiance noone is saying get rid of pvp things
[2:19:40] sphynx_rayne: @diasterrr Yea. I love pvp and i don't mind doing 2s and 3 s but It's hard to fine people that want to have fun doing it and not go toxic assholes
[2:19:41] DeanoTV: we just want more for pve
[2:19:45] Affiiance: @DeanoTV i know
[2:20:09] Artivicii: Give m+ a chance to titanforged 4Head
[2:20:17] kowaikoro: exquisite ams
[2:20:21] SyrothTV: what if it's intended to filp flop betweent pve and pvp for highest item lvl now?
[2:20:22] Artivicii: +30 ilvl 4Head
[2:20:39] StateFarm206: @Artivicii got to have loot that drops 1st KEKW
[2:20:49] diasterrr: @sphynx_rayne bg is also an option ( and its the better option ) but yea true i agree with that , it is good that gearing up with pvp is an option again , but its bad that there isnt any alternative for it for other players that dont want to do it , i feel pve players they are honestly right, they dont like to do it ! so they shouldnt have to be , i mean idk whats wrong with blizzard....
[2:20:56] Artivicii: Easy just run the correct dungeons
[2:20:59] TwentyAUT: i am a blood dk in full pvp 220+ equipment, i dont see why i should run myth+ in pvp i know what i get, and those are my main stats. the system is weird but thats how it goes.
[2:21:00] MILESkg21: OMEGALUL
[2:21:14] pereadin: I cd'd itt too

[2:21:20] nixxy_7: classic dps noobs :(
[2:21:31] Artivicii: Yeah it‚Äôs 3rd add for me too
[2:21:34] PToastman: Priest died. Sky is blue
[2:21:35] Affiiance: Im still an advocate for rewarding playing all aspects of the game. Im mainly a M= and Raider, but PvP has been enjoyable this expansion
[2:21:43] Universe__: Explosive went off
[2:21:44] garkhyt: DPS when they see boss < 30% just tunnel :D
[2:21:53] nixxy_7: now DPS be like: why should i dps that add, the other guy should dps ... and so on .. lool
[2:21:53] SuperCracker: They need a mythic+ vendor give me points every time I complete a m+ dungeon based on what level key it is and if it was completed on time or not. Then let me spend those points on whatever piece of gear I want from a vendor. Pretty simple fix in my opinion. It really sucks when I‚Äôm 10keys in and haven‚Äôt seen a single piece of gear
[2:21:54] damigeINC: You run 10 M10's and get maybe 1 or 2 item upgrades and 350 anima - running m+'s is getting depressing (as someone who enjoys m+ the most)
[2:21:58] pereadin: I cd'd tthe 3rd justt didn'tt have anyone else helping me PepeHands
[2:22:15] dreamwalker213: @mystar_twenty most classes don‚Äôt want vers mainstat so what are they supposed to do?

[2:22:39] SyrothTV: @SuperCracker like badges?
[2:22:46] Artivicii: @supercracker with weekly and daily m+ quest
[2:22:49] TwentyAUT: @bmackin213 cause icyveins tell you so? idk, overall dmg is constant and great
[2:22:52] Affiiance: Brute forcing on Tyrannical is rough, these fights last too damn long
[2:23:15] sphynx_rayne: @diasterrr I mean I get it when people don't want to play pvp. i just feel like both side pve and pvp should have same when it come to gear. There nothing wrong with having two part to your game
[2:23:18] StateFarm206: Question for the chat what is a quick way for alts to catch up on renown ?

[2:24:33] SyrothTV: @statefarm__206 ahh so either you have a calling quest that will give renown or you can get a rando one from lfr or heroics
[2:24:58] Affiiance: In low keys maybe @critcobain

[2:39:39] Affiiance: 3rd boss is the only kinda annoying one I think its rough on healers
[2:40:05] mobbo: Manastorms are only hard if you accidentally kill one of them too early

[2:42:03] bostonwinsx: 200??? when does that start

[2:42:17] Gingerprimer: @Affiiance correct
[2:42:28] kroknows101: Didn't Blizzard say they're going to nerf TW loot after Ulduar to bring it more in line with current raid loot? Remember reading it somewhere, but not for sure?
[2:42:29] Naturalbeef: They reduced the TW Raid loot correct?
[2:42:33] mobbo: It‚Äôs back for Hakkar
[2:42:34] Epidoral: How long till reset ?
[2:42:35] on_sale_menswear: you usually lust first pack and then you have it for hakar again if you do the correct route
[2:42:38] Liebkraft: i think the idea is to have it ready again at the 1st boss
[2:42:38] mobbo: Usually
[2:42:51] feelswyzman: that was close xD
[2:42:56] bertooso: Usually back with route unless dps super good for your key level

[2:49:26] svicaa: Whats the best race for monk @Towelliee ?
[2:49:40] DeadagainFFS: I don't think anyone actually likes hakkar fight lol
[2:49:54] Artivicii: Hakkar with spiteful lust is easy tho
[2:50:08] MrKray2: @towelliee do you think in later patches they will bring more dungeons? Like maybe a Maw dungeon?
[2:50:26] Zeke__64: Eu gets cucked like every week since 15 years Sadge

[2:57:27] razma_: your deeps is kind a low too
[2:57:35] Tigerklaue: this is without lust and prideful would been a ez kill if people switched on explosive
[2:57:40] CritcobainTV: yeah, damage definitely is low

[2:58:56] jeneraljelly: Good attitude to have man.. so many streamers are ragers now a days
[2:59:01] sphynx_rayne: Last min. LFG for WB is pain in the ass XD
[2:59:10] kodtheog: ^ i agree way too streamers are ragers
[2:59:14] kodtheog: and its annoying
[2:59:19] thebakeriscomingforu: I think that there is a tuning issue. Healers and DPS with the same gear levels seem to be able to do higher content then tanks. The abilities just shred tanks right now.
[2:59:21] Skorkin: The adds spawn every 20% ish and sometimes you get unlucky and have 0 time to dps adds while he blood berriers them.
[2:59:24] gorilla_quantistico: i tend to rage just when i have very limited time irl
[2:59:40] Gaphill: too many people in general take games too seriously
[2:59:51] brain_wash: Not just streamers, have you seen Any chat channel on Any server... WoW rage is real my dude
[2:59:53] kodtheog: i just feel like being toxic in a key does nothing for your group but make people wanna just quit easier
[2:59:56] kodtheog: so i never understand it
[2:59:57] thebakeriscomingforu: Its why it is a "kiting" meta right now. All the tanks are running
[3:00:06] CritcobainTV: I tend to get pissed off when people waste my time and then complain about other people when they're the ones fucking up

[3:00:52] DeadagainFFS: Well i mean, thats how Legion keys were as a whole. The whole kiting meta isnt nessecarily bad its just different from what bfa was
[3:01:17] kodtheog: that ring is so good for dungeons
[3:01:18] crich85: I‚Äôve timed a 13 DOS this week but still have no clue the mechanics on this fight
[3:01:37] thebakeriscomingforu: Some tanks are built to kite, others not so much
[3:01:52] thiccsushi: @hagmania How'd you like it?
[3:02:02] CritcobainTV: @crich85 phase 1 soak beams, line up the rupture so it stops his doom cast, phase 2 disarm bombs and tank bleed mechanic. make sure you stun her with the purple ring to stop her rocket chicken barrage
[3:02:13] Artivicii: @crich85 KEKW
[3:02:30] Artivicii: Kite is a huge loss of dps
[3:02:36] diasterrr: @crich85 just read it on wowhead , there are guides for every dungeon
[3:02:37] northcub: im tryingt o get to 5
[3:02:38] Artivicii: Unless u need to
[3:02:49] CritcobainTV: my buddy got his DH to max and got it to like 185 ilvl and timed a 12 with just grabbing aggro and kiting LUL
[3:02:49] zaraine1: dont understand the ruptures as well tbh
[3:02:55] hagmania: i loved the raid. so many mechanics that were fun to work with

[3:07:14] tlolod: hurts my rotation bruh
[3:07:16] Slicerv: the warlock really needs to learn to hit the explosive with corruption

[3:08:39] P4RT1CLEM4N: I find this to be one of the harder dungeons because you can't ignore most boss mechanics and get by..
[3:08:39] sinlesssinner: its a pug bro, you cant expect much :)
[3:08:40] pereadin: we do
[3:08:40] gorilla_quantistico: prob they have defensives not keybinded KEKW

[3:09:08] sinlesssinner: just wait for the broker bitch, that debuff gonna wreck ya faces! @Towelliee
[3:09:16] Gerr_x: yeah but on normal and heroic you can ignore it
[3:09:22] zaraine1: everyone lusted this fight nobody knows mechanics LUL
[3:09:24] gorilla_quantistico: yep you should know that from m0s
[3:09:27] SyrothTV: that style of mechanic has been in a couple different dungeons since like wod right?
[3:09:29] thebakeriscomingforu: you assume people are doing normal and heroic first
[3:09:32] RocketMan23: but if you never pay attention to that mechanic in normal/heroic they dont know what to do in mythic
[3:09:41] MeedLTU: i never knew it gives a damage buff .. i probably did 10ish dos runs

[3:34:06] Thadune: Why would I want to run any M+ right now when the gear is so inferior right now giving the difficulty level.
[3:34:08] SabakuBlood: @quakezilla69 trying to get into a mythic as any class is retarded
[3:34:09] smilylol_: next time @Towelliee take your cov teleporter to the flight path closest to oribos, it saves so much time to fly from there
[3:34:11] TomReforged: Stuck at Renown 18 this week. Tried running mythic 0, raids but nothing dropped. is there a cap?
[3:34:11] BigCarlM: i bought 3 BOEs so far to keep up
[3:34:14] Dasbeerbootsocool: @Towelliee picking tank as monk or pally, any suggestions :) ?
[3:34:18] SSD511_: I just quit M+ and doing rbgs to get gear even I hate doing pvp
[3:34:30] Sollice: @TomReforged Your not stuck at Reknown 18
[3:34:37] George2001k: @towelliee what is the problem with gear atm?
[3:34:42] gorilla_quantistico: i have time go get only one 226 so there is not much choice lol
[3:34:46] Vigi9413: illidan boe's are mad expensive though
[3:34:46] Quakezilla69: @SabakuBlood yeah dude, is been very annoying
[3:34:50] Sollice: You can get to 24 as of right this second. World Boss, dungeons etc give reknown
[3:34:50] zaraine1: also getting same shit in the vault is just depressing
[3:34:52] SabakuBlood: @TomReforged You have to do the quests???? LOL
[3:35:08] Sollice: NIght Fae Niya gets 2nd potency
[3:35:08] razma_: the vault system is fine i would like a global conquest system wqhere you can get conquest point in any content you want to do and the ilvl of the gear scale wqith the content you did (like pvp raiting)
[3:35:09] Quakezilla69: @SabakuBlood people only want, hunter/mage/boomy, it seems
[3:35:10] TheSteve: literally cant even lose mmr from Rated BGs. take your raid group, fill in every low slot with 220s, 226s. pve droprates are shit
[3:35:13] xLink_tv: @TomReforged did a new char and got all the way up, get hcs/lfr, make sure to do the campaign quests too
[3:35:13] SabakuBlood: @quakezilla69 Its demoralizing and I just stop playing after awhile
[3:35:14] Vigi9413: is renown 24 max until reset?
[3:35:18] Sollice: So I am assuming MM hunter DPS should go farther up
[3:35:19] zigzugg: @Towelliee what about a currency to buy a 2nd item in the vault? like every 3rd week or something
[3:35:20] Affiiance: That one actually is bad, they are stunned half the time they are doing less damage
[3:35:20] NILLme: raidbots is your best friend if you cant decide what to pick
[3:35:31] pokerigo: Did they finish de other side?
[3:35:33] D3m0nHunt3r666: Celestial is a life savior lol
[3:35:36] Sollice: Yeah 24 is it for the next hour or so
[3:35:38] StateFarm206: Ive gone from 0 to 14 in the last 2 hours lol
[3:35:39] kowaikoro: 2 renown an week pepelaugh
[3:35:42] Mecabeast: I think all your play for the week going into the vault feels bad as far as gear progression wise. I'd like to see the weekly system removed and get rid of m+ loot and use a valor point like system with key rankings to mirror pvp.
[3:35:43] mrrazputin: 27 is next week
[3:35:44] Ryok: only 2 renown a week
[3:35:47] storm99413: ruffle is a pet
[3:35:48] propoopimus: ruffle is a pet
[3:35:48] thebakeriscomingforu: ruffle is a battle pet
[3:35:49] shimwood: Ruffle has ridges PogChamp
[3:35:49] Cypfer: 2 per week
[3:35:49] Sincline387: ruffle is a pet I think
[3:35:51] Lincoln_WoW: ruddle is a pet
[3:35:56] Affiiance: Not a fan of the this Time Gating
[3:35:56] TheSteve: ruffle is a pet
[3:35:57] Gerr_x: RIP
[3:36:01] thiccsushi: wait what
[3:36:03] temp3st98: KEKW
[3:36:04] intitterus: 3 for 7 2 for 9
[3:36:05] SlackerSlack017: lol
[3:36:06] Sollice: Look at 26
[3:36:07] PidiaP: Cap is renown 2 per week
[3:36:07] kowaikoro: campaign is done KEKW
[3:36:09] zaraine1: no campaign
[3:36:10] TheCliffyShow: Cause you touch yourself at night.
[3:36:11] SabakuBlood: To draw it out
[3:36:12] D3m0nHunt3r666: you tell them towelliee xd
[3:36:13] NeoJon82: No Quests for Campaign
[3:36:13] Armdel: gotta drag it out as much as possible
[3:36:14] akia03: or they added a new quest no campaign
[3:36:14] sakura_2020: but you need to lvl companions up FeelsBadMan
[3:36:14] abbosss: because we would get the 3rd renown level from campaign quests
[3:36:17] RocketMan23: cuz the 3rd renown came from the campaign
[3:36:17] George2001k: @towelliee click on the next renown level to see it
[3:36:23] SSD511_: For alts
[3:36:25] NILLme: thats stupid
[3:36:29] SabakuBlood: Hahaha game is going to the dumps again LULW
[3:36:31] DarthLemon: would people pet battle if it got a vault slot
[3:36:33] RocketMan23: lol
[3:36:34] Vigi9413: @sollice but I don't think its best for MM to go the other potency path
[3:36:34] abbosss: KEKW
[3:36:36] Thadune: @towelliee Because small indie company needs more money from you... so they timegate it all.
[3:36:36] Cypfer: 3rd renown for not getting loot
[3:36:38] razma_: add a quest or something
[3:36:42] abbosss: blizzard not being stingy KEKW
[3:36:42] razma_: not complicated
[3:36:43] bitman_gaming: Why not torhgast
[3:36:46] Vadagar1: World Boss gonna be in Ravendreth after reset?
[3:36:47] Arktos99: yeah screw time gating, I want to farm 100000 anima to unlock everything Kappa
[3:36:48] MILESkg21: already time gated brunout FeelsBadMan
[3:36:49] Sincline387: give me stuff faster so I can complain when were done lol
[3:36:50] kaaotick: just put it on the world boss
[3:36:51] D3m0nHunt3r666: Imagine timegating after the content is over ruyuLUL
[3:36:57] Sollice: ? The next potency path leads to the final DPS poision thing
[3:36:57] necralia: they gonna milk that renow for weeks
[3:36:59] Dasbeerbootsocool: kindly suggestion for picking tank as monk or pally?
[3:37:04] Antdavs24: heroic gear token would be nice lol
[3:37:09] nat0li: @Towelliee hey Towelliee anywhere we can get your personal wow UI setup ?
[3:37:14] Bounty4321: @Towelliee If you go by +3 Renown per week moving forward you end up at 49 and the 50th level is by itself so... probably really likely it's only +2 Renown a week now :(
[3:37:18] propoopimus: do a normal
[3:37:19] propoopimus: got time
[3:37:21] MILESkg21: !ui
[3:37:21] Moobot: We have a new, updated Towelliee SL UI! | wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK. Check !Discord's pinned messages in the #cesspool channel for further installation details. Dont forget to make backups!
[3:37:25] razma_: the vault system is fine i would like a global conquest system wqhere you can get conquest point in any content you want to do and the ilvl of the gear scale wqith the content you did (like pvp raiting)
[3:37:31] Vigi9413: isn't Burrs best for Niya?
[3:37:35] buzzerktv: did so many PF this week for my dks conduit still no luck
[3:37:37] VBTIGER89: Come mark don't be stingy
[3:37:39] nat0li: thanks mate
[3:37:45] MILESkg21: no prob :)
[3:37:45] Skaboy_TV: There's still time for a normal plaguefall!
[3:38:00] pereadin: Fixing PvE gearing is tthe only way to save their game though
[3:38:08] D3m0nHunt3r666: how hard is to revert changes LUL
[3:38:08] Gerr_x: make raider-io an in-game stat instead of using an addon and duplicate that score across to a PvE vendor
[3:38:09] pereadin: Chalk it up to "attempting a new system"
[3:38:10] Antdavs24: tweak gear drop % just a little bit please
[3:38:10] Bounty4321: They could at least just revert the change to raid loot? The "Fix" lol
[3:38:11] Affiiance: The longer they let things sit and dont change things the madder people will be
[3:38:11] SSD511_: Pve VS pvp
[3:38:14] Lincoln_WoW: i think its going to be valor + bonus rolls
[3:38:16] jonnydepth72: They should just add a token system like pvp had
[3:38:16] Lincoln_WoW: or something
[3:38:18] Bokktosh: it is not very cash money at all
[3:38:19] kodemonkee: too many systems on top of systems, shitty gearing, too much time gating...
[3:38:22] mobbo: Item upgrades KEKW
[3:38:24] zaraine1: im fkin dreaming plagufall and still no fkin trinket
[3:38:30] Vigi9413: I don't think they'll give bonus rolls
[3:38:31] Dashamidon: what they need to is not require you to have a 2200 pvp rating to get your weapon
[3:38:33] BreastFriends: I'd love valor
[3:38:34] mrrazputin: No gear from Raids and M+ easy fix remove PVP vendors trololol :D
[3:38:34] luckfore: why are they waiting for patches to roll out the changes? hotfix them in asap
[3:38:36] Wubaghowski: It is shitty the next mythic week I on march 23rd tho @Towelliee
[3:38:38] KinggKebab: They definitely need to match +15 key loot drops being at least heroic raid ilvl
[3:38:40] pereadin: I'd be happy with a valor system as well
[3:38:40] smilylol_: lol I forgot about valor
[3:38:43] aftrglw: I just came back for SL, how much gear did they take away? What was it like before?
[3:38:44] Thadune: @towelliee Whats loot? never heard of her
[3:38:46] kowaikoro: thats aight
[3:38:47] NILLme: give me valor vendor and no bullshit RNG rotations like the corruption vendor
[3:38:56] Gapz: @Towelliee whats the difference between valor and conquest?
[3:38:58] Vigi9413: id rather valor
[3:39:00] pereadin: @Towelliee what would the max ilevel in those vendors be?
[3:39:02] esceti95: hey towl what did ya get from weekly chests ?
[3:39:05] Vigi9413: fuck residuum
[3:39:06] Mecabeast: use valor point to upgrade my gear too
[3:39:10] thebakeriscomingforu: My guess is that it will be Valor. Since it adds the ability to get more loot, but doesn't change things to much
[3:39:12] AutumnReds: thing is people are already quitting, so they really should be a bit faster with w.e they decide
[3:39:15] Mecabeast: m0*
[3:39:15] chaostheory8907: @esceti95 Not reset yet
[3:39:18] Skaboy_TV: Residiuum would require us to actually get gear to drop.
[3:39:26] Daggerstry: Just found out me using Kleia as a BM hunter is worst Kyrian covenant..... RIP
[3:39:32] Sollice: @Vigi9413 I dont think so because poison is a dot on an interupt plus the 2nd potency
[3:39:37] Thoreya: but if the patch isnt coming out till like may whats the problem
[3:39:39] Thoreya: its 4 months awya
[3:39:41] esceti95: @chaostheory8907 ah cool guess im just in time
[3:39:49] GlakusWoW: casuals malding this expansion LUL
[3:39:50] Vigi9413: they could also bump up WQ gear ilvl
[3:39:50] Dashamidon: @Towelliee yes agree but allow it just for gear
[3:39:51] Affiiance: They always give catchup gear for that
[3:39:57] Vigi9413: 181 is d9gshit
[3:40:00] Dashamidon: gold even*
[3:40:01] mojusk: should a lfr piece be upgradeable up to mythic?
[3:40:02] Lincoln_WoW: there is a massive hard wall at 185 item level until about 200 tbh
[3:40:06] cahoots82: The average player doesn't need to be mythic raid geared though
[3:40:07] OldManMitch: I'm a casual player and there is a hard cap around 200 that makes it tough to progress.
[3:40:07] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:40:21] D3m0nHunt3r666: 197 @Towelliee
[3:40:22] D3m0nHunt3r666: Kappa
[3:40:23] OnePlayerPete: @Lincoln_WoW Campaign gear?
[3:40:24] Thoreya: 197
[3:40:26] Zendero89: just like the honor gear
[3:40:26] gorilla_quantistico: 197 will be max
[3:40:31] PaPaBeaRCA: They should be upgrading the ilvl only for the people doing the higher content/difficult content
[3:40:33] SorionTheGinger: @Towelliee has always been restricted? corruption would like a word LUL
[3:40:34] Jlohh: Just get good, hit 2400 in pvp and get full 226 equipped 4Head
[3:40:35] AlyzziaTV: Whats the most annoying to me is how i could get decent gear on my alts pretty easily in the past but now it is so much work
[3:40:42] mojusk: some players dont step foot into an instance though
[3:40:58] nyypsycho: It‚Äôs 197. The renown gear
[3:40:59] Thoreya: idk i think were getting a lil carried away
[3:40:59] dcorey416: I just hate busting ass in raid and only getting anima
[3:41:00] Vigi9413: was Valor just from completing pve content?
[3:41:03] WoW_StandalonE: ppl, there is always AH, just buy gear 4Head
[3:41:03] Thoreya: imo
[3:41:05] propoopimus: damn 700 anima how you get so much
[3:41:05] SlackerSlack017: i just want my alt QOL changes :(
[3:41:07] Lincoln_WoW: campaign gear requires anima tho which is already hard to come by
[3:41:09] souplordtv: @Vigi9413 yeah
[3:41:10] cahoots82: There's nothing to catchup to now though? This is the first tier
[3:41:13] Ardailec: FeelsBadMan No Ketchup. Only mustard.
[3:41:16] dcorey416: deff not worth it
[3:41:17] EarlofCockwood: @Towelliee you will watch the Biden inauguration tomorrow?
[3:41:18] Aervyper: @Towelliee but WQ 184..... if your done story your entire armor is 197.... so WQ are useless for everything but wpn, and jewelery and trinkets..... For the majority of people that are 205 we are stuck there literally STUCK
[3:41:21] tumey23: Idk i kinda like it. you dont get the loot if you dont do the content
[3:41:21] Sollice: BBQ sauce
[3:41:25] pk99: we demand ketchup
[3:41:25] shimwood: No ketchup, like God intended LuL
[3:41:27] decix5: That's not really true? The vault makes you BIS faster than any other expansion
[3:41:29] kodemonkee: that's why I unsubbed, am waiting how next patch will be
[3:41:29] Amarlian: the campaign gear is nice, it just uses up anime to upgrade
[3:41:31] gorilla_quantistico: and they sold the exp as being very alt friendly
[3:41:33] Antdavs24: campaign gear is really useless too unless on an alt really
[3:41:33] nyypsycho: Can‚Äôt get into mythic dungeons much less a raid as a 186 I level rogue. Lol
[3:41:48] aftrglw: I got my alt from like 150-180+ over a week or so, but it'll be much grindier getting him to 200+ it seems
[3:41:50] propoopimus: but you arent stuck at 205, go raid heroic, go do keys
[3:41:55] thebakeriscomingforu: also just bad luck from loot drops and choices are impacting people to
[3:42:03] litagood: @nyypsycho farm your conquest through low cr rbg's
[3:42:03] mansblake: whats your favorite tank right now? @Towelliee
[3:42:05] OnePlayerPete: @nyypsycho Make your own groups?
[3:42:09] TomReforged: Facts
[3:42:10] MILESkg21: what about the people who cant raid
[3:42:14] northcub: I wish you would stream all day, so relaxing to listen to while I play along side
[3:42:14] DarthLemon: !ui

[3:42:16] Dashamidon: @Towelliee its like ive said blizzard is getting more disconnected with the vast majority of there player base, because they keep raising the bar
[3:42:17] JediNeo99999: keys are very unrewarding outside teh vault
[3:42:20] Tensei_c: stuck @ ilvl 206 bc i don't do m+ and raiding drops nothing
[3:42:22] jure__: mythics are pretty shit for gearing
[3:42:23] Vigi9413: go raid heroic LUL do you know what Heroic pugs want?
[3:42:23] Daggerstry: 208 iLvL and you still get denied to keys as low as +2s
[3:42:23] mo197: why did you switch from panda to Tauren?
[3:42:26] jeeslouise: Maybe they dont deserve it then
[3:42:26] Affiiance: If they dont do the content should they get the gear though? Whats the point then
[3:42:27] bicchiaki: some ppl gotta work 40+ hours a week bro lol
[3:42:29] Thoreya: so get rid of ilvl so everyone can be the same
[3:42:29] cahoots82: M+ is terrible for gearing atm.
[3:42:32] esceti95: yeah the only reason im raiding now is due national lockdown once im back to normal life its gonna be casual andy for me LUL
[3:42:33] litagood: and do your weekly pvp quests
[3:42:34] parlangua89: what are you hoping to get out of the vault this week?
[3:42:35] Thoreya: idg this whiny argument man
[3:42:39] Thoreya: i dont like it
[3:42:44] Wheeellz: What on earth do you need gear for if you dont have time to play the game
[3:42:51] valkonice: "succesful"
[3:42:53] VictorAvalanche: what mission table addon is that?
[3:42:54] Bounty4321: @Towelliee I feel like they're letting a potentially great expansion die because of this whole loot issue and being so quiet about everything, really sucks.
[3:42:54] nyypsycho: I rerolled my DK. I‚Äôm trash at pvp. Lol
[3:42:54] Thoreya: it has shown no effect on blizzs numbers so far i think were getting a lil carried away
[3:42:56] sinlesssinner: valor badges are coming in 9.1, trust
[3:42:58] Vigi9413: the reason casuals can't gear is cause heroic pugs want already AOTC for fresh raids
[3:42:58] Sandisy: done 10 keys this week, 7 in time. had no usable piece of loot drop, just 2 for slots that have better. it is not fun
[3:42:59] Antdavs24: @Vigi9413 lol seriously, people think it's that easy
[3:43:02] gorilla_quantistico: tf back HYPERS
[3:43:09] TomReforged: Because we have friends we want to play with @Wheeellz
[3:43:11] CrucifyMTG: would the game survive minus all the casual players
[3:43:15] EarlofCockwood: :D did someone ever red the follower combat log?
[3:43:17] Aervyper: So... i'm 205 on my main..... i gotta learn Mythic + 2-7 then farm mythic 5-8 over and over and over until i get my ilvl to do it all over from 8-12 then AGIN from 12-15 to be what......
[3:43:19] ijuki: What‚Äôs the ilvl from firelands tw?
[3:43:22] propoopimus: well, that is the reason they are 205 casual, has nothign to do with work or being selfish. you get what you put into the game
[3:43:24] TomReforged: we just cant sit down for 4 to 5 hours and do everything
[3:43:25] CADZtv: i think catch up for previous ilvl gear somewhat is fine but never the current teir
[3:43:26] MILESkg21: the people asking for AOTC are the ones wanting boosted
[3:43:31] gorilla_quantistico: shadowforging KEKW
[3:43:34] Karbonn: I actually have zero motivation to do mythic + anymore. I've been RNG'd so bad, no items from 21 runs in a row. :(
[3:43:41] kaddyyz: @Towelliee what addon u use for the mission table?
[3:43:42] Dashamidon: @Daggerstry i know and that is why blizzard keeps get more disconnected
[3:43:44] kowaikoro: KEKW 0%
[3:43:46] NplusK: 470 gear just from running a Vision last patch was ez gear
[3:43:46] Xerevil: now it's like...you want an upgrade??go PvP lol
[3:44:00] snoo_32: i think a large portion of the wow community is more emotional than logical. It can be hard for them to do challenge content.
[3:44:02] Affiiance: I think the power gap between players who play all the time and those who dont is in a good spot

[3:44:32] yunggluten: @Karbonn I got 1 trinket from 13 mythics this week. it was a downgrade. So no loot for me

[3:59:01] Twizlathan: I am Rival but conduits at conquest vendor only sell at 213? Why is this?
[3:59:02] litagood: @Towelliee does not help to do the callings when you spend more than twice the amont of gold for one hour of raid, and half of it goes to one hour of wipe's results in a repair bill of a similar amount. yes i know its a bit late.

[4:00:08] Wildside1177: @kaddyyz Easy don;t do any on your alt.
[4:00:09] thebakeriscomingforu: My guess is that Blizzcon will reveal the pve fix and showcase 9.1 patch
[4:00:10] bobby031784: been stuck at 200 IL for a mounth
[4:00:10] zigzugg: i'm at sundancer if you wanna hit it before reset
[4:00:12] noteworthynerd: I am casual and I do feel alienated. I've not been able to find a consistent M+ group and LFR gear is bad :(
[4:00:16] Subtlesnipes: you dont think shadowlands is cadual friendly?
[4:00:24] TheFabilolz: @shrenko lirikH
[4:00:25] Simple_Hero: I need the gold or anima to be better for raids. I can't believe how little is given and its like "Thanks for work this hard in Heroic, here is 50g/35 anima"
[4:00:27] I_DoctorSatan_I: yeap, getting bored with my BM Hunter, thanks to Blizzard, we're now ranked 24th (dead last) for M+ and Raid content. FailFish FailFish
[4:00:29] thebakeriscomingforu: alt friendly til 60
[4:00:33] letrickyxd: @runnersgaming it's too hard to get loot
[4:00:35] kaddyyz: @Wildside1177 its mandatory if u want legendary and legendary is usually a significant part of the gameplay
[4:00:36] teqnikirl: requiring 10 M+s to max out the vault, is too much.
[4:00:41] Raanoren: im casual and quit playing already
[4:00:44] FR4NCO: why did it go from alt friendly to not being?
[4:00:45] souplordtv: SL could be alt friends with PVE vendors and ash catchup
[4:00:56] Cypfer: that's the definition of casual
[4:00:57] Vigi9413: @towelliee on a scale of 1-10 how pissed will you be if they give Sylvanas a redemption arc?
[4:00:57] Affiiance: Yeah the Anima Drought really hitting my alts hard LUL
[4:00:58] Rimstar: what is the pink circle? looks really useful as my mouse always goes missing

[4:01:32] kowaikoro: the maw FeelsBadMan\
[4:01:37] NILLme: 9.1
[4:01:38] litagood: if the game is going to get more alt friendly they need to increase the amount of loot dropping from the diffrent sources of pve content.

[4:01:39] I_DoctorSatan_I: BM Hunters make up 0.2% for +10 keys, 1.6% for +20 keys whereas MM Hunters make up for the rest 15.4% popularity for the Hunter class
[4:01:40] Cypfer: they gotta be before the next tier for easier upgrade so you can do the new raid properly
[4:01:40] zaraine1: torghast is bad as well... maw sucks, raid is good dungeons are good but loot is bad
[4:01:40] FR4NCO: @Towelliee what changed to make it not alt friendly now?
[4:01:43] Novirtue_: The ember court for me is the most fun thing of going venthyr
[4:01:46] jaythaog: We can open vault at 10 right?
[4:01:50] YNGThugnificent: @Towelliee if u start an alt and just do BGs along with content, ur ilvl 184 from honor vendor at 60.. not so bad from that standpoint!

[4:31:34] I_DoctorSatan_I: Hell's Kitchen Season 18/19
[4:31:37] xch4se: Designated Survivor is so crazy tho
[4:31:38] OnceAMoose: William Zabka was approached so many times to portray the character in other movies, like a Rocky film, but turned everything down, until Cobra Kai.
[4:31:39] MILESkg21: final season of cards was shit
[4:31:40] Antdavs24: house of cards was great

[4:32:46] warrenny: @xluckydawgx Need to watch that and the boys
[4:32:46] Sollice: The only problem with Wandavision is so short, I tried to spend so much time looking for easter eggs
[4:32:48] chrispape: they were just saying this will be the last season of Peaky Blinders :(
[4:32:48] Cypfer: I want my Umbrella academy s3
[4:32:49] KiLLERJA0: wandavision is slow right now
[4:32:51] reinhardtdog: I got all hooked on The Expanse.. I didn't really need a new series to watch.
[4:32:53] banishtyrion: binged Suits through the holidays :P
[4:32:53] vintersorgSA: Yeah, I dont care much for it. I'll keep watching but it's not amazing.
[4:32:53] MILESkg21: so close to being done with my MCU playthrough then catch up with wana
[4:32:56] Czyszn: wait they cancelled altered carbon!?!??!?!?!
[4:32:56] Kriven: @Sollice so many actors that are slimballs but make for good watching. 2 and half men while a sitcom was funny with sheen and terrible without him lol
[4:32:57] KiLLERJA0: im sure it will pick up
[4:33:01] Sh4nti: Wandavision was too slow imo especially for 9 episodes total
[4:33:02] MILESkg21: wanda*
[4:33:02] vintersorgSA: like, the mystery ISNT a mystery
[4:33:02] onous_: ü§£ The last season of House of Cards was shit because Kevin Spacy was a creep.
[4:33:05] XpoZe: I think she is coolest MCU character though. She needs a more bad ass show/role @Towelliee
[4:33:05] Sollice: @Kriven Very true
[4:33:07] StraightErro: It's a slow start for sure
[4:33:09] kodtheog: @Czyszn did they really/
[4:33:11] JmacTV: Anyone watch the joke of a movie WW 1984?
[4:33:12] Thadune: @Towelliee thing in WandaVision is that its a TV show. People are acting like its a movie
[4:33:14] parlangua89: first episodes in a show like wanda will pick up usually and they tend to be slow as shit
[4:33:15] Tiburon502: thanks
[4:33:16] onous_: Wandavision is good.
[4:33:17] Kneckt: schitts creek is hilarious
[4:33:17] branTVx: @towelliee you ever watch sons of anarchy?
[4:33:18] Antdavs24: wandavision is doing weekly episode release?
[4:33:19] Czyszn: im asking lmao
[4:33:25] soldi_26: Thats how game of thrones was for me few episodes is when it got good
[4:33:27] vintersorgSA: Mandalorian was amazing right out the gates tho
[4:33:28] kodtheog: i dont remember hearing them cancelling it
[4:33:29] MILESkg21: Antdavs24 just like Mando
[4:33:29] KingGoris: i think falcon and the wintersoldier is gonna hit the ground running
[4:33:29] MrKray2: @towelliee watch Luther! Gritty English crime drama with Idris Elba
[4:33:31] AudioJaq: It‚Äôs soo good
[4:33:40] Czyszn: yep looks like altered carbon was canceled
[4:33:44] Sollice: @Towelliee Yeah but think about Wandavision in the same exact way TV was during the episodes. 50s,60,70s didnt have a lot of drama. The later episodes will reflect TV as its more modern and will be more action packed
[4:33:44] kodtheog: wow
[4:33:45] Sh4nti: Like they've already spent like 25% of the season for the setup for Wandavision makes it kinda ResidentSleeper
[4:33:45] Czyszn: FUCK that show was amazing lmao
[4:33:47] Aeylid: yes they canceled altered carbon
[4:33:47] kodtheog: it did get cancelled
[4:33:47] bc_23_: It‚Äôs not supposed to an action show. Just a sitcom
[4:33:50] onous_: Im looking forward to 2022 and Mando coming back and seeing where it takes off.
[4:33:54] kodtheog: that show was such a dope concept
[4:33:54] Aeylid: im still in mourning
[4:33:57] Antdavs24: @MilesKG21 gotcha
[4:34:00] josh8555: heard they are making a new GoT show or a spinoff maybe
[4:34:04] thiccsushi: the boys is my fav show
[4:34:06] qtkushy: 100 is too teenagy
[4:34:07] kodtheog: the 100 first season is really bad but then it picks up
[4:34:08] xluckydawgx: NAH The 100 is shit
[4:34:09] JmacTV: Is The 100 wanna be lost?
[4:34:09] Czyszn: they are its a prequel @josh8555
[4:34:10] gidgeet: Maybe I am weird; but TV doesn't intrigue me like it used to.
[4:34:12] Cypfer: you gotta chew through the first 5 episodes
[4:34:13] GrimsterGG: the 100 is amazing
[4:34:13] HawtPepperTuna: Servers alive or is this PTR?
[4:34:14] MILESkg21: true LUL
[4:34:14] xluckydawgx: the first 3 seasons were great
[4:34:15] KingGoris: the 100 seemed like a show high school kids would like
[4:34:16] ManneehFresh: I gave up on CW shows after supernatural
[4:34:16] RocketTanks: The 100 is terrible. They killed off the one good character in it.
[4:34:18] herblex: 100 is really good
[4:34:19] cubfucious: @Towelliee The 100 gets much better after Season 1
[4:34:22] Roughneck124: Season 1 sucks or the 100

[4:55:04] hondoom: @Towelliee Also a lot of the people doing 20's right now are doing it on the toons they got Hall of Fame on, so that's forcing a lot of ppl to be on those toons. WW for example. Not that it's bad, just that it was what was prepped to do high keys
[4:55:04] Sollice: This is why I want to switch off MM hunter
[4:55:07] PaperBird: monk Pog

[4:56:47] JmacTV: Will make it better to watch imo
[4:56:47] hondoom: "Team compositions must contain 5 unique classes. Teams are not permitted to use 2 of the same class during any given dungeon run." Per the official rules :D

[4:57:20] I_DoctorSatan_I: so, they cant have a BDK and UDK?...even though one is Tank and other is DPS?
[4:57:23] Shrenko: MDI is pretty boring
[4:57:25] kowaikoro: sadge jb
[4:57:26] GoGetItKo: he's just trying to help mods :(
[4:57:38] Thatsafy: @I_DoctorSatan_I imagine having bdk KEKWlaugh

[4:57:48] D3m0nHunt3r666: MDI got boring especially last season
[4:57:49] thiccsushi: its really not worth 1600 bucks
[4:57:51] wellis40: wellis40 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 2 more months!
[4:57:55] Buckwink: it would be great for new faces
[4:57:55] DaltonIRL: MDI does overall seem like a giant waste of time
[4:57:58] Affiiance: The MDI is terrible to watch as an Esport tbh
[4:58:02] Shrenko: but Blizz is just a multii dollar company
[4:58:02] galinhoo: Good for a stack that qualify and just yolo it
[4:58:04] Poriand: who retired?
[4:58:05] Shok1597: so break the meta in pugs by starting your own groups and inviting the lesser taken classes
[4:58:08] Affiiance: AWC gonna beat MDI in viewers this expansion
[4:58:12] Wheeellz: its 8k for 5 ppl
[4:58:12] Sandisy: oh great, we'll get dungeon heroes trying mdi strats in +8 the week after, alts will suck LUL
[4:58:14] Aro725: blizzard has to make enough money to put more money in this. I mean they cant be that cheap right?
[4:58:14] peinen: Blizzard should be embarrassed
[4:58:15] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Thatsafy That was for example...id rather have VDH as tank anyway
[4:58:20] JmacTV: 220k a cup or something?
[4:58:22] JmacTV: 20*
[4:58:23] LeBraum_James: @Poriand lightee

[4:58:35] MILESkg21: !permit rakim88
[4:58:36] Moobot: @Rakim88 will not get timed out for the next 3m (@MilesKG21)
[4:58:40] imthabeast: Not to mention figure if out how do do mdi type pulls and practicing them must be fucking hell for 8 hours a day
[4:58:41] duncon: so many acronyms i can't keep up with what everyone is saying :D
[4:58:43] Rakim88: https://raider.io/mythic-dungeon-international/sl-season-1-time-trials/global-1 time so far
[4:58:43] Aro725: wasnt it the same in WOD when they sold all the pets and stuff to make the prize pools bigger and blizzard didnt put in a single penny LUL
[4:58:44] Froudini: 25-30k ish
[4:58:45] pera_red: what's the placing criteria for MDI?

[4:58:55] Kneckt: @WonderMog the only one
[4:58:56] Poriand: 30ish
[4:58:56] Sollice: I think moving esports to Youtube was dumb
[4:58:56] MILESkg21: no prob dude :)
[4:59:00] xvstormvx: @were there any nerfs this maintenance
[4:59:01] Altimia2k13: servers need to hurry up and open
[4:59:01] thiccsushi: going from twitch to youtube hurt them im pretty sure numbers wise
[4:59:01] x2sagat: and they blew it with sc2
[4:59:03] hondoom: The viewership went so down when it went to youtube unfortunately
[4:59:03] Affiiance: OWL is dead now
[4:59:06] Czyszn: OWL got canceled
[4:59:06] DaltonIRL: WoW in the MLG wrath days was prime fucking content @Towelliee
[4:59:06] LeBraum_James: OMEGALUL WL
[4:59:06] slaperl: its cause they dont invest into it very much
[4:59:07] Poriand: 30ish when cdew was playing
[4:59:09] WonderMog: HoTS was such a great game for esports and I miss how popular it was
[4:59:10] soysos91: yootooob
[4:59:10] MILESkg21: OWL is dead
[4:59:11] dynnesty: HoTS had potential
[4:59:13] I_DoctorSatan_I: Blizzard's mistake was going to YouTube for AWC and MDI
[4:59:19] Sh4nti: SAME
[4:59:19] Rottencoarse: @Sollice oh yeah that was dumb
[4:59:20] SeckSymbols: HoTS never had potential
[4:59:20] Velashen: Overwatch was artificially inflated. They pumped loads of money into it.
[4:59:21] Powered_: HOTS was fucking amazing
[4:59:22] hondoom: HoTS and Starcraft most potential and they just don't put money into it
[4:59:22] I_DoctorSatan_I: Twitch had MORE views
[4:59:22] Shrenko: even the game is dead
[4:59:25] xvstormvx: @Towelliee were there any nerfs this maintenance
[4:59:28] bec0o: overwatch is dead
[4:59:28] stjon13: I really hate that HOTS didn't take off
[4:59:30] manmower: Counterstrike dying as well
[4:59:31] TommyVercetii: i mean if they pumped money into a certain game for tourneys and shit, that game would blow up so fast because everyone would change to it
[4:59:33] Bassodia: HoTS was good Sadge
[4:59:35] Armdel: OW is dead until OW2 probably
[4:59:35] Rakim88: check that link for teams scroll up

[4:59:38] DaltonIRL: Blizz needs to stop trying to make every thing they do an esport
[4:59:39] cruzeal: overwatch isn't dead
[4:59:44] Poriand: overwatch 2 going to be dead
[4:59:45] x2sagat: blizz is so bad with esports just lookl back at dota 2
[4:59:46] Sollice: I still love HoTS. I play it every now and then to chill out
[4:59:46] Affiiance: LoL is the one Esport that is holding strong
[4:59:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: SC making a comeback Kappa
[4:59:52] reinhardtdog: Bunch of pro players retired too I think from OWL
[4:59:54] eternaldamante: csgo has been dead for awhile only reason its still out because of esports
[4:59:54] sphynx_rayne: OW dead? towBlind
[4:59:55] bec0o: CounterStrike will never die LUL
[4:59:57] Sollice: and I almost insta que in HoTS so its not dead
[4:59:58] WonderMog: oooh its the beta client
[5:00:00] reinhardtdog: Going to Valorant
[5:00:02] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS something is borkedd
[5:00:02] stjon13: I love the Bliz chars I hate LoL chars
[5:00:04] Kneckt: @WonderMog its not beta anymore
[5:00:07] NILLme: OW died because they tried to turn the game into esport LUL
[5:00:09] Shrenko: HOTS is a fun game
[5:00:11] Ser_Theobald: @manmower Counterstrike dying with around 1,000,000 concurrent players? lol
[5:00:14] azzurrin: MDI is what's hurting Mythic+
[5:00:14] PadidinJones: Its dead Jim!! jokes
[5:00:15] Marz311: I stopped caring about OWL when they switched to youtube.
[5:00:25] WonderMog: @Kneckt mine hasn't changed in like 4 years and i keep updating it
[5:00:27] azzurrin: Legion was so much fun
[5:00:30] NILLme: blizz is too greedy
[5:00:35] Kneckt: @WonderMog wierd. Updated it 2 days ago when they announced it
[5:00:35] ohaithurr: @Towelliee Riot is the same way, Riot won't let other non Riot tournaments happen without their approval
[5:00:36] MILESkg21: even with hackers CS will never die
[5:00:36] thiccsushi: Blizzard def wanted to keep the money
[5:00:38] PotbellyGoat: I am hyped for Galaxy Grape this afternoon!
[5:00:43] bec0o: they greedy
[5:00:56] hondoom: That's that Activision Pride
[5:00:57] bec0o: they cant fix their servers
[5:01:00] LeBraum_James: blizzard is communist when it comes to esports
[5:01:01] Czyszn: they dont realize the more money they give out the bigger they will get in terms of market
[5:01:02] DaydreamerAdam: Greed definitely plays a role with blizzard-activision
[5:01:02] Affiiance: They lost some of the best Esports Casters bc of how they do things
[5:01:03] IxProNoobxI: @ohaithurr yea but RIOT can do that, it doesn't hurt them at all. League is huge
[5:01:03] Shrenko: @Potbelly_Jenkins same!
[5:01:03] TommyVercetii: whats amazing is they dont seem to try and profit off of WF because they could make it a company event. instead they just let it go
[5:01:05] Czyszn: look at LoL or Dota
[5:01:06] reinhardtdog: Definitely how it feels : /
[5:01:09] Czyszn: they throw money at everything
[5:01:11] Masqerader: weren't they charging like millions for a OWL Franchise lol
[5:01:12] sharie: Riot does a good job
[5:01:15] Thadune: @Towelliee I think moving to YouTube was a terrible move still
[5:01:15] DaltonIRL: @Towelliee Blizzard esports seem like a failed attempt to gain a few extra dollars while other esports such as LoL seem like extensions of the game.
[5:01:18] Kazualll: How would Bobby rate the engagement in blizzard esports
[5:01:20] x2sagat: thats why dota 2 or csgo are so much bigger
[5:01:20] Czyszn: and they are watched but millions
[5:01:23] Affiiance: Riot does an amazing job with Esports
[5:01:24] MILESkg21: it was like 10 mil per team
[5:01:25] Wulfgrym: yep feels like they expect you to be grateful to be in blizzard
[5:01:27] thiccsushi: look at prize pools of LoL or dota compared to wow esports its insane
[5:01:31] duncon: so blizzard is a communist company? got it.
[5:01:31] slaperl: the most watched event wow has is RWF and blizz doesnt even support it
[5:01:33] kodtheog: @DaltonIRL thats a good take tbh
[5:01:34] gorilla_quantistico: the thing i dont like about mdi is that it restricts blizz dungeon design possibilities
[5:01:40] Sollice: Will be funny if LoL MMO has some sort of MDI kind of thing with dungeons and they pay shit tons and they make it huge
[5:01:40] IxProNoobxI: Riot is really why esports is where it's at today
[5:01:41] leshiltv: They treat their teams same as they do their employees‚Äîpoorly
[5:01:44] LeBraum_James: LUL
[5:01:44] Czyszn: YIKES
[5:01:45] epiczplz: meanwhile dota players compete for a mulit million doller prize pool
[5:01:47] knigghtmare: LOL
[5:01:47] Buckwink: lol thats dogshit
[5:01:48] sphynx_rayne: ewww
[5:01:51] MILESkg21: 5 and a team manager shit LUL
[5:01:53] letrickyxd: @gorilla_quantistico no it doesn't
[5:01:53] joaoludgero: !addons
[5:01:53] Moobot: We have a new, updated Towelliee SL UI! | wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK. Check !Discord's pinned messages in the #cesspool channel for further installation details. Dont forget to make backups!
[5:01:54] Aakku: if you win
[5:01:58] sphynx_rayne: thats a yikes for me dog
[5:02:00] PhoenixAuTv: no, sadly thats how it is with blizz
[5:02:00] Quojin: they suffer from Disney syndrome
[5:02:00] hondoom: It feels like Blizzard is too afraid to spend their millions to reinvest it to profit more, they just wanna keep their lemonade stand open instead of putting it in walmart
[5:02:01] Djaygam3s: even ESEA for CSS, CSGO, and other FPS games are bigger than blizzard esports
[5:02:02] bigbambooski: 8 grand for 60+ hours a week
[5:02:03] Kinghorn: its why people quit OWL, they can make more money streaming
[5:02:04] GoGetItKo: $8,000 /5 = $1,600. One stimulus check KEKW
[5:02:08] bigbambooski: yikes that is aweful
[5:02:10] Foglatch: It is all Bobby Kotick and Activision
[5:02:10] Buckwink: OTK should do it
[5:02:11] StateFarm206: New lfr wings lets go KEKW
[5:02:13] PapaGiggles: thats assuming you win lmao
[5:02:16] sterlingpls: @Towelliee Seems like a chicken and egg scenario where they don't care because viewership is low but don't have viewership because they don't care lol.
[5:02:16] i_m_reddy: it‚Äôs activision
[5:02:18] bec0o: OTK
[5:02:18] manmower: they have savvy leadership that shaves the pennies and nickels
[5:02:19] Big_Fudge52: OWL starts in April... It's not dead but its definitely not as popular as it was
[5:02:19] Andrewgp: Even with the CDL they were charging like 30 mill for a CDL team spot
[5:02:20] Kinghorn: new LFR? towPog
[5:02:21] FryeTV: OTK will do it.
[5:02:24] Timozuna: well it's nice for maybe amateurs to do but if you want to good the hours out not worth
[5:02:26] Masqerader: @Towelliee the RWF is a prime example of how to do it
[5:02:26] nheonkitty: but the credit for winning would indeed improve your viewership
[5:02:26] Bullentor: do it
[5:02:30] sharie: more like willing to Pay
[5:02:30] knigghtmare: I RATHER CARRY MYTHIC +10 for days
[5:02:30] WonderMog: Blizzard could easily kill the Competative scene, they just suck at it
[5:02:32] letrickyxd: @gorilla_quantistico if anything, the MDI will be largely more boring this time round, cause of forced small pulls and target capping
[5:02:32] TAULYD: Servers taking forever this morning
[5:02:33] D3m0nHunt3r666: @Towelliee just like toy funding ruyuLUL
[5:02:34] Aro725: you mean that blizzard WOULD pay. They have plenty to pay lol
[5:02:35] cRUSSIANthegame: E Sports is a bubble
[5:02:35] thiccsushi: Blizzard also scammed the esports community with the prize pool thing they did in BfA
[5:02:39] Timozuna: grind*
[5:02:39] Poriand: i think OTK will be dead org in a year. i dont think they know what they are doing
[5:02:39] MILESkg21: all they have to do is make it community ran
[5:02:40] bec0o: OTK doing that now
[5:02:44] EpicJune: Multi-Dollar company LUL
[5:02:47] NplusK: $10K total prize pool I think
[5:02:52] muradinnnn: AngelThump
[5:02:53] DaltonIRL: @Towelliee Just look what The international for Dota vs WoW LOL Valve raises millions and gives them to the players, creates a sense of community. Blizzard pockets it
[5:02:55] Czyszn: what division
[5:02:57] Rovek714: @towelliee it can be done. The sc2 scene stopped getting as much support but the community still runs some decent tourneys for the pros
[5:02:58] Doomlace: Wasn‚Äôt there a pet scandal prize issue with the last Blizcon tournament?
[5:02:59] thenirv10: wow, feral dps is actually half decent again?!
[5:03:02] PhoenixAuTv: @towelliee didnt they scam players with the item shop in game saying it was going to players or something and blizz took it all??
[5:03:02] LeBraum_James: they just hire crooks
[5:03:03] knigghtmare: don't understimate OTK
[5:03:07] Deadeagle509: So what is the maintenance today? I know they have one every tuesday but this one seems a bit more than a normal reset
[5:03:07] Rottencoarse: maybe OTK will do that in the future?
[5:03:09] Affiiance: They just need to hang up Esports and let the Community do it... Look at RWF
[5:03:09] Velashen: Bleeding money
[5:03:10] manmower: can't be an esport unless they dedicated more time to balancing things
[5:03:13] bigbambooski: yea its just to keep the numbers on the high end
[5:03:14] Sollice: OTK main face isn't even main streaming right now. He needs to be doing streaming and promoting on it more now then before since its new
[5:03:14] kumah_1: idk why blizzard is so weird when it comes to pvp
[5:03:14] Rottencoarse: AWC XD
[5:03:20] D3m0nHunt3r666: yup
[5:03:21] azzurrin: Hearthstone is in the shitter now
[5:03:22] SlackerSlack017: hearthstone? :(
[5:03:22] hondoom: @Towelliee 10k Prize Pool cap, 10k Sponsor Contribution cap for community tourneys
[5:03:23] Thoreya: AWC been with us for a while
[5:03:23] Andrewgp: they will never get rid of their e sports
[5:03:25] IxProNoobxI: HearthStone?
[5:03:29] x2sagat: cries in warcraft reforged
[5:03:31] Andrewgp: even if they lose money every time
[5:03:32] bec0o: they killed Hearstone
[5:03:33] Velashen: They tried to pump cash into it instead of building organically.
[5:03:34] SeckSymbols: Starcraft is a dead game
[5:03:34] alwayspounding: hearthstone???
[5:03:35] brokenhelix85: Starcraft is like 99% community driven though
[5:03:35] zombified_kitteh: Certain Amount per Tournament? Would the be a loop hole and just make multiple tournaments like a Tournament Weekend? ;)
[5:03:35] Affiiance: Blizz biggest Esport event is RWF... and Blizz has NOTHING to do with it
[5:03:36] Czyszn: OTK was a variety show with nothign to do with WoW -__- did not enjoy that stream as a WoW stream
[5:03:36] dannyis1337: they messed up when they went exclusively on youtube
[5:03:36] Tyrlisele: why is it still down
[5:03:36] Phunky_Phan: Phunky_Phan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! wassssup
[5:03:37] SeckSymbols: Dead Franchise
[5:03:37] WonderMog: HoTS was the best Moba I've ever played and I think if they would of kept at it for a couple years it could of been competative to league
[5:03:38] MILESkg21: HS is silent too
[5:03:38] NILLme: SC2 and SC1 is the only real blizz esport game, rest is "wannabe esport"
[5:03:39] Poriand: @Sollice 100% agree
[5:03:39] Kneckt: 10k KEKW
[5:03:42] Thadune: @Towelliee You know Gingi loses a shit load of money right now because he cant stream
[5:03:43] bec0o: Heartstone was going big then they killed it
[5:03:46] Kinghorn: because they are on youtube
[5:03:47] I_DoctorSatan_I: @knigghtmare huh? They got deleted 0-3 twice in a row in both upper and lower brackets LUL
[5:03:51] i_m_reddy: y is there a 10k cap? wtf
[5:03:53] PhoenixAuTv: @sollice no he doesn't he doesnt care for money
[5:03:54] Doomlace: The community bought a pet thinking it was contributing to the prize and Blizzard turned around a kept the money instead??
[5:03:54] Masqerader: lay off 800 employees, record profits, then give like 12k in prize money while crowd funding it with toys @Towelliee
[5:03:56] AyeitzDenny: LOL i cant believe maintenance is taking so long >.<
[5:04:00] blinca: half a million would be fine
[5:04:01] Twizted23faith: multi dollar company
[5:04:04] denflup: fking blizard man
[5:04:05] thenirv10: when did feral druids get good?
[5:04:07] hondoom: That's a "Community License" for tournaments, but there's a "custom License" which is the 10k MINIMUM so not sure what the difference is
[5:04:08] Kinghorn: I would watch HS tournies but I am not going to youtube to do it
[5:04:08] JmacTV: Blizz are small indie company, they can't afford big prizes
[5:04:11] Todmeister9000: is Blizzard stingy?
[5:04:13] Wulfgrym: fuck that
[5:04:14] denflup: why he cant stream¬°?
[5:04:14] bigbambooski: they would make so much more money if they did that
[5:04:17] ImSura: why cant he stream ?
[5:04:17] Greencaps07: they can stream they dont want to
[5:04:18] Czyszn: why cant he stream?
[5:04:20] Kneckt: KEKW
[5:04:20] IxProNoobxI: Now Riot adding TFT into the mix which is doing great as well
[5:04:20] manmower: you can't give millions of dollars to videogame players
[5:04:21] KiLLERJA0: @Towelliee doesnt even need to be that, high 100k would probably do it
[5:04:21] denflup: what happened to gingi?
[5:04:22] Yagr6: y cant he stream?
[5:04:23] maccaruso: Servers still not up? Extended maintenance inc!
[5:04:23] Raketenraucher: KEKW
[5:04:29] D3m0nHunt3r666: true LULW
[5:04:30] letrickyxd: @Aruar89 can't stream to give strats, that's why no MDI team streams
[5:04:30] Affiiance: Cant stream his strats
[5:04:32] Nevrbloom_: 8 grand thats it? OMEGALUL
[5:04:33] Junkai0203: @Towelliee , Look at how they burned the money from the toys for the "Prize Pool"
[5:04:37] Armdel: They don't stream because they don't wanna leak strats
[5:04:40] Odinslayer: don't think they doing it for the money though, the echo guys
[5:04:40] FryeTV: Its the prestige for him though. So respect to Gingi
[5:04:41] Czyszn: ooooo
[5:04:44] Sollice: @PhoenixAuTv It's not about money? He has the largest viewer base and the biggest platform to push the OTK brand and he isn't streaming on his main channel.
[5:04:45] Aro725: You remember GCDtv towel? if it wasnt for them AWC wouldve dies in WOD
[5:04:46] kodtheog: 8 grand? that seems like a slap to the face
[5:04:47] thedadbodx: Blizzard, just a little indy company...
[5:04:47] NashMarco: PepeHands plus he is playing 18hours a day practicing offstream
[5:04:48] D3m0nHunt3r666: 8k with or without taxes? Kappa
[5:04:49] sterlingpls: @Towelliee Gingi likely brings a lot of viewership/attention by winning MDI an investment in his brand.
[5:04:51] thiccsushi: yeah that toy scam was so stupid
[5:04:52] Tsrif: all of the ex Method EU people do it because they want to be the best in the world, the fact Blizz as a company basically shits on that work effort is sad @Towelliee
[5:04:55] bernuby: how do i get this new blizzard launcher?
[5:05:03] ToadyMcToadFace: :D
[5:05:12] manmower: if the prize pool was going to be millions they would have to slowly increase it over 10 years to get more competitors
[5:05:17] ohaithurr: @Gerk1n opt in beta in settings
[5:05:18] Czyszn: wait MDI lets you use addons? thats kinda dumb lol
[5:05:20] AutumnReds: man full maintenance today
[5:05:23] Poriand: @Sollice I think asmon didnt realize how much work OTK would be. i think he regrets it
[5:05:26] I_DoctorSatan_I: who cares about who's got the best strat, that has nothing to do with individual accountabiltiy.....
[5:05:26] Armdel: @Gerk1n should be rolling out to everyone in the next few weeks
[5:05:28] Onearmyof2: There's like 0 snapping in these dungeons it seems
[5:05:42] Andrewgp: if they dont want them to stream it, they should have a higher prize pool since they are losing money not streaming in general
[5:05:49] gorilla_quantistico: maybe theyre changing shit up thats why they late
[5:05:50] regicidall1: How do I get the new battle.net app?
[5:05:51] IxProNoobxI: yea mythic plus this expansion is really all about the tank and heals..so many bad tanks out there don't know how to handle kiting, they just wanna tank and spank like in previous expansions
[5:05:51] hondoom: In S4 MDI There was the strat in ML to aggro all the mechs and fight them on the boss - that was not known by every team competing, so super cool to see that develop from lack of streams. Sucks that they don't get the money tho :(
[5:05:51] SeckSymbols: I'm surprised Blizz hasn't done much class tuning or any tuning in general for a little while now
[5:05:53] TommyVercetii: they have no power
[5:05:56] x2sagat: they should look over to Valve thats how u do it
[5:06:05] FryeTV: @Poriand He's not really incharge of doing the behind the scenes work aspect of OTK
[5:06:06] Gerr_x: @Towelliee i think the problem is that they made those rules back before twitch was a big thing, and they haven't adjusted them to account for the amount of money popular streamers make
[5:06:09] Onearmyof2: @Secksymbols they did last week
[5:06:09] Sollice: @Poriand Yeah I think your right. Dude can take a break whenever he wants he is entitled to it. But now he has this other new thing he has to push and it's a huge commitment if he wasn't it to be successful
[5:06:09] Czyszn: @Secksymbols they just realeased a buff last week lol
[5:06:10] Boss__Wizard: @Gerk1n just enable the beta version in the launcher
[5:06:12] Bwelder87: shadowland dungeons are gonna be boring to watch too... No place for creativity with pulls
[5:06:13] manmower: doesnt dota have a big prize pool? isn't that based on a warcraft license?
[5:06:21] TommyVercetii: but @Towelliee what esport does well other than DoTa? almost all those games never have full spport
[5:06:24] TheJediMessiah: "Blizzard can AFFORD to do better in Esports!" - Towelliee 2021
[5:06:26] Czyszn: huge prize pool in the millions
[5:06:26] azzurrin: Reason why Blizz doesn't make huge MDI cash prize is because they'd actually have to balance the classes all the time like Riot does with LoL. And we know how long it takes for them to to that, lol
[5:06:27] Kromede: https://youtu.be/LdgzsF_O7oI?t=47 not save for stream but hilarious KEKW
[5:06:40] Klauzzer: but its small indie company?

[5:07:07] alwayspounding: riots*
[5:07:08] MILESkg21: small indie company Kappa
[5:07:08] Sollice: @FryeTV Thats not the point. Think of it this way. If they created a new NBA team and Lebron was the face of franchise and part owner. But then he did no promotion for it. It doesn't really work out well. Again he can take breaks but he is the main face
[5:07:09] Masqerader: I mean Counterstrike is pretty big, do what they do
[5:07:12] SelfishJuggler: Going DOTA 2 price money? That would really put the Blizzards Esport up alot!
[5:07:16] dracullatv: Bobby would have to sacrifice like 5 mils from his annual salary LUL

[5:07:35] kamahlls: J Allen butt wants to spend all the money on his twinks collection
[5:07:35] I_DoctorSatan_I: People are already doing MDI strats thanks to Drantanos MDT...MDI Teams will use 99.99% of MDT from Drantanos "strat".
[5:07:36] Jarlan23: they could but theyre cheap. they just fired their entire customer service department baically
[5:07:39] sharie: The E Sports Org Cloud 9 Spend 5 Million Dollars to get Perkz from G2

[5:08:06] hagmania: you have to treat esports like cable networks treat live sports - it's a loss leader

[5:08:43] Czyszn: boom
[5:08:43] Cru3: thats so sad
[5:08:45] Odinslayer: but for real how much you want them to put on MDI?
[5:08:45] malaano: budget meeting probably cost them more in salary than MDI budget
[5:08:48] Wildside1177: Ah the quarterly stock review is what drives them. Nothing else.
[5:08:48] Karbonn: Because Activision doesn't give a CRAP about anything but dollars.
[5:08:48] Czyszn: and CoD prints money
[5:08:51] largefromage: HOTS? koolHA koolHA koolHA
[5:08:51] papaherc: clip it and ship it LOL

[5:09:01] Bwelder87: imagine they annnounce a 1 million prize pool MDI
[5:09:01] OldManMitch: It's a marketing budget, not direct line ROI
[5:09:01] thiccsushi: riot loses money doing their esports but its exposure is huge
[5:09:02] pereadin: Please someone clip that whole thing
[5:09:07] Bwelder87: people would get crazy
[5:09:07] manmower: if they had some exciting casters they paid as well
[5:09:10] pereadin: Make command !budget xD
[5:09:10] Affiiance: Running it at a loss in the beginning can pay off in the long run
[5:09:11] thejakewilliams: this is also the same company that laid off hundreds of people before christmas so *shrug*
[5:09:16] Czyszn: BUT IT IS A RETURN TOWELIEE if it got big you knwo how many people will buy the game because its BIG and fun to watch
[5:09:20] Czyszn: and money involved
[5:09:20] hagmania: and what i mean by that - cable networks lose tremendous amounts on live sports to get more in return. spending on esports really would be longterm ROI
[5:09:20] thedadbodx: crazy to think how long they've been going and yet have tried to screw up so many times
[5:09:22] xvstormvx: @Towelliee those games have come and gone tho

Even tho I enjoy MDI, you can‚Äôt reward 5 people competing against difficult pve. As much as you can with 6v6 multiple bracket team based multiplayers. People just enjoy that far more than MDI, even if they don‚Äôt play the games. If attracts more viewers.

[7:08:06] Treason824: lol
[7:08:16] MrGattz: its not that people are dumb, its that they never did the raid before
[7:08:23] wolfieke: it's not bugged .....
[7:08:26] famousthomas: cleave damage
[7:08:31] TiredCarcass: it would be better if he had only one foot
[7:08:33] GoGetItKo: <-- --> which one is L again? KEKW
[7:08:33] wolfieke: u see it taking damage
[7:08:39] ThatsProto: It is that they are dumb - they aren‚Äôt listening to commands

[7:08:45] OG_Fear: in Timewalking
[7:08:50] Gebirges: there is way too much damage on the other foot
[7:08:53] Lantern214: @Towelliee He's not turning, b/c the team is doing split dps on both legs. The other foot is taking the same amount of dmg, no one can touch the other foot
[7:08:55] yunggluten: its not bugged lol
[7:08:56] hooliggan: @Towelliee check meters see whos hitting what
[7:09:02] Rakim88: might be just too much claeve, like alot of classes have cleave now just built into their kit
[7:09:04] valianya: I think his turning is either broken or there's not enough dps actually on the foot vs the ads
[7:09:04] nihilistic_bat: KEKW at least we all learned not to do this raid today
[7:09:04] Artivicii: yeah cleave is very sensitive here
[7:09:06] yunggluten: people are hitting both feet
[7:09:07] Beantot127: or.....everyone is trolling him....

[7:09:50] LOLdotCOM: it was always this scuffed, even in cata
[7:09:52] josh8555: same
[7:09:54] nihilistic_bat: F
[7:09:59] wolfieke: classes that can't stop cleave damage and stuff should not even be touching the boss , they can even go afk if they want but do not touch the boss if u can't do sdingle target damage
[7:10:00] Voodoochild77: Small indy company. Everything is working as intended
[7:10:01] Gebirges: is there a shadowpriest attacking the wrong foot?
[7:10:05] Halomateo: not bugged just cleave is too much, bladestorms, dh eye, etc
[7:10:06] knigghtmare: classic wow too hard to retail
[7:10:08] valianya: Shadow priest hitting wrong foot
[7:10:09] xTuHypeD: SP was target wrong foot lol

[7:15:38] Realjaywalker: the feet automatically even out their hp even if you only attack one
[7:15:44] PavelNaNetu: or do they?
[7:15:53] wolfieke: I think they do at least lol
[7:15:53] LOLdotCOM: the feet reset, they don't really take dmg
[7:15:55] Realjaywalker: theres even an achievment you can get for aonly attacking one
[7:16:00] Aervyper: @Towelliee and think about this...... The fight drops 200 ilvl items.... Wow blizz

[7:17:08] swampt1l: ? @bens_tatertots
[7:17:16] LOLdotCOM: you have to look at the % of each foot, one has to be lower percent than the other, as they reset to match hp

[7:17:52] Aervyper: only way to know for sure
[7:18:03] Meshindale: @Towelliee maybe they are cleaving the other foot and thats causing it not to turn? try single target only..no cleave
[7:18:23] Masqerader: lol its like Gruul, when 20 people is better than 25
[7:18:23] oradros: dot might fuck it up
[7:18:29] swampt1l: people are still gonna attack LUL
[7:18:30] TiredCarcass: this will work well :|
[7:18:35] MrGattz: dont even breath

[7:18:39] Urebaldd: I mean your consecration aoe's too
[7:18:44] blucifer1320: Lol
[7:18:51] OG_Fear: Don't consecrate either @Towelliee
[7:18:56] OG_Fear: ur technically cleaving both
[7:18:57] Ozzietree: could still see tons of animations going at the other foot.
[7:18:57] Forcekinn: inc bladestorm
[7:18:58] oldmandinkleberg: I saw a bunch of chain lightning
[7:18:59] OG_Fear: it is hitting both
[7:19:01] Urebaldd: It was though
[7:19:04] PavelNaNetu: the journal clearly states that dmging both legs equally will make him move in straight line
[7:19:06] oradros: doubt
[7:19:11] Gebirges: you hit both feet all the time though @Towelliee
[7:19:18] Artivicii: 1 hit is like 20+ on the other
[7:19:18] OG_Fear: I was legit watching ur consecrate hit both XD
[7:19:19] bens_tatertots: Modern wow classes not made for this boss lul
[7:19:25] oradros: but i would say dot may be the issue
[7:19:27] stormbear7: the left foot hp bar was going like 4/5k hp behind right foot
[7:19:28] Urebaldd: Man I dunno all the tw raids are completely screwed in SL
[7:19:30] Sweetzer81: how many attempts on this boss so far??
[7:19:36] Bleusempai: pulled this from gamepedia, @Towelliee Typically only a few players are assigned foot duty. Note: the longer phase 1 lasts, the more damage Rhyolith's phase 2 abilities will last,
[7:20:00] LOLdotCOM: the legs pulse every few seconds, and they reset to match hp, like spirit link kinda

[7:21:48] TheRavenGrave: i forgot the name of this boss
[7:22:05] angahax: he should already be turning
[7:22:08] ChoboToss: It's bugged bro, he's not supposed to be hard to turn at all.
[7:22:09] feelswyzman: lmao
[7:22:10] LOLdotCOM: you dont have enough dps to turn it
[7:22:26] azzurrin: bugged
[7:22:29] OG_Fear: hes turning now
[7:22:34] tlolod: this boss dont give a fk
[7:22:34] Bakuryuha96: Nah this shit is so bugged
[7:22:34] Eaderbug: yeah he is supposed to be real easy to turn
[7:22:41] piratechris: He is ignoring you
[7:22:43] Gebirges: Area52 was the problem KEKW
[7:22:44] feelswyzman: hahahahaha
[7:22:50] GoGetItKo: he said fuck mechanics, come at me
[7:22:52] Rakim88: LUL
[7:23:01] excessior: skip him
[7:23:12] Boosted7M: last time I tried to run it TW it was fucked during BfA
[7:23:15] ThatNavGuy: no surprise LUL
[7:23:15] Rakim88: boss is broken considering the amount of passive cleave ppl have now in shadowlands
[7:23:16] supremedringus: @Towelliee Maybe some lag registering the damage incorrectly, or at least super delayed? Maybe that why it turned on a delay?
[7:23:17] MrGattz: you mean to tell me that blizzard didnt test this raid before they brought it back for TW? i dont believe you Kappa
[7:23:17] flickerzz94: right Mechanics
[7:23:17] knigghtmare: can you skip the boss and go another one?
[7:23:18] ZabberzTV: alright dont do tw this time
[7:23:19] jbwow01: There is just too much passive cleave in the game today to manage a mechanic like that.
[7:23:23] oradros: he's option isnt he ?
[7:23:26] Brazzle42: is it only working when he is near the edge
[7:23:36] josh8555: so have 2 groups one on each leg and switch
[7:23:46] knigghtmare: trinkets are just aoe
[7:23:50] Thasin22: @Towelliee need your opinion, would you take a 220 stone legion trinket or 220 legs to replace 194 legs. legs are haste mastery
[7:23:56] LOLdotCOM: the turn factor is determined from how much % a leg is, from teh other, each time they pulse and reset hp to match
[7:24:03] Goosemantm: I don't remember him this hard to move during cata
[7:24:17] bfwnathan2: area 52 is up
[7:24:22] Novirtue_: It really isn't

[7:24:37] Rakim88: nice loot system blizz :)
[7:24:39] D3m0nHunt3r666: A52 got bombed for good @Towelliee it saved you time from the raid
[7:24:42] oradros: gatekeeper gonna decimate tank
[7:24:42] Artivicii: couldve got 5 bosses of heroic at least
[7:24:48] Buttscratchrr: pvp gear system is better
