[1:06:00] hammack52: more health and more mana
[1:06:01] kw3nk: sanc, i struggle with threat. It helps a bit
[1:06:03] Redn3ckHippie: Yooooooo what is that buff add on @towelliee

[1:06:16] sinlesssinner: @chat then, maybe u know. In 9.1, are they adding new layers to the regular Torghast wings?
[1:06:22] Seerated: Old BC it was BoSanc > BoK. I ran Sanc all the time unless maybe solo

[1:07:20] Borzlox: @LatencyDeath gotcha. i'm 59 now, dont have mucy gold bc i took a long break from classic, so most AH gear is out of my budget
[1:07:25] Seerated: Guess it depends aswell. Once you get enough spellpower BoK is probably better than the reflective dmg/threat of Sanc
[1:07:25] hammack52: with that fast speed you will be fine, righousnes is not based on the weapon damage

[2:11:13] downkoros: He is doing 500 G every hour
[2:11:28] NovaSun84: So I'll be insensitive a bit and ask... when we say "bot" do we also include Asian players who farm gold and don't speak english well?
[2:11:33] IZemekiSI: the whole idea of players can only ever be a bot if they are farming gets legit people who are loners banned
[2:11:37] captivate7: @TacoVendor93  ty ty
[2:11:38] downkoros: they just killing the game
[2:11:54] NovaSun84: I legit define bot differently, and I don't think most people do..
[2:12:04] Shongoshi: there is never too much gold

[2:12:05] oxidexd: never
[2:12:06] Th3Hammer: @Novasun00 Whats being Asian have anything to do with cheating? A cheater is a cheater.

[2:12:49] CardinalTX: Noy gonna lie. never worry about gold. When i have enough for what i want or need i spend it
[2:12:53] NovaSun84: Because a "bot" is a program using automated software to cheat the system.  My "asian farmer" is an actual human being farming gold.
[2:13:00] IZemekiSI: specially when 95% or better dont talk in game at all cause they are in discord
[2:13:12] Aidler: @grizlysword negative - they make another character or account - lol

[2:14:52] igor93: @Towelliee do you think Blizz will allow boosting BE and Dranei a little while after TBC is out?
[2:14:54] SonofHorus82: I also got gm checked one time too. I was like "beep boop no sir I am not a *static* bot beep."
[2:14:55] GonoFPS: dude I had some weird interactions with GMs
[2:15:02] Lesrek: They can, but you have issues with false positives
[2:15:11] GonoFPS: but they know about bots, they just gave up by now let sbe honest lol
[2:15:13] IZemekiSI: yea but that isnt how you detect that stuff
[2:15:13] dalaraz: i see randoms of the opposite fanction poke me when im fishing,if i respond im safe,otherwise they killing @Towelliee

[2:15:37] IZemekiSI: cause almost all bots are ran the same way with an overlay
[2:15:45] FerociouzMonk: back in Wrath i had a Gm whisper me and i thought he was another player so i told him to eat a dick and fuck off. 24 hours in the corner LUL
[2:15:50] MetallicusGaming: A bot most likely ain't gonna be in a guild and have a full conversation about just anything right so they could check that to start with
[2:16:01] warrenny: @ferociouzmonk Lmfao
[2:16:21] killerkure12345: did u announce that giveaway u told me on the phone yesterday
[2:16:33] Aidler: when a druid, and bots are 90% druids, runs around in a circle constantly it might be a bot
[2:16:39] GonoFPS: everybody looks like a bot in the middle of a 24 hour classic leveling

[2:17:21] DecayedmiNt: Banning bots won't do anything tho.
[2:17:26] Mecabeast: bots are the names that are random letters for name that make no sense
[2:17:32] sifer007: LULW
[2:17:33] Atruis_: Back in Cata a player asked if I was a bot cause I was farming leather.

[2:18:16] killerkure12345: average twitch chatter is legally mentally unfit so cant really be suprised
[2:18:22] IZemekiSI: and in most cases those bots dont even use the GUI
[2:18:36] IZemekiSI: so you typing in game to them means nothing to it lol
[2:18:37] Atruis_: Guarantee most the population of classic bought gold.
[2:18:37] Aidler: I also always report those duds and it's always druids
[2:18:49] IZemekiSI: lol
[2:18:57] vadergod1980: so their power boost tools on multiple servers and selling the account for cash/gold?
[2:19:06] IZemekiSI: yeah bots infalte and ruin the market

[2:19:23] MisterPooky: buy the mats and craft with them EZ gold
[2:19:26] silodin: Ask the runescape community if bots are fun :)
[2:19:36] Atruis_: Cheap is good for the buyer. bad for the seller/flipper
[2:19:45] killerkure12345: i have a pimple in my throat
[2:19:46] PacioliNB: We will see what the choke is.. bots make everything cheaper minus those 1-2 things they use to generate and control on the high end
[2:19:47] Descina: my friend bought gold, lost his account, blizz wouldn't give back, he had to buy a new account, he lost a lot of shit
[2:19:48] CritcobainTV: REMEMBER THE SUNWELL
[2:19:48] GonoFPS: you get bots on one hand and on the other you get people spamming for carries
[2:19:48] vadergod1980: he said she was cheap
[2:19:54] IZemekiSI: i mean realistically if you see a high level purp on the auction , its not a player selling it
[2:19:55] GonoFPS: it's a never ending battle in my opinion =)
[2:20:22] IZemekiSI: its a bot that got it for cheaper and is now setting th emarket for that item
[2:20:35] GonoFPS: whats funny is people buying spectral tiger mount and getting intant locked out

[2:56:59] PvtHudson093: isnt it cheaper to buy the mats for the epic mount than buying epic riding?
[2:57:09] Mitchendo64: does a prot paladin want a SP shield or a shield with Shield Block rating in TBC? @Towelliee
[2:57:15] mimsx: mimsx subscribed with Prime.

[2:58:11] AtomicHeartSon: Mount is like 500g, the quest is like 375g or something
[2:58:16] toobaked1987: @Towelliee are you going to be able to relax at all before the 1 week marathon?

[3:01:47] BadLebowski: I bought the boost and regret it.  I haven't played WoW in 10 years and have no idea what I am doing.
[3:01:51] AtomicHeartSon: the stats on the boosted gear is 35/40 ish
[3:01:55] Siraeyou: I didnt even know they went back on their initial statement of boosts getting the equivalant of 50s dungeon blues. The greens are the equivalent of like level 47 green gear
[3:02:03] Holysal: i was in a bg as a 51 and 2 shotted a 58 mage KEKW

[3:08:12] CritcobainTV: ZG isn't HARDER now, the main issue is that mages have the aoe cap now so we run oom way before the mobs die, which means that i have to pop 5 mana pots and have an 8 minute kill phase because i don't have the dagger that drops in mara to give mana back

[4:07:21] IZemekiSI: a mod folder in a mod folder in a mod folder will not work
[4:07:29] Avaricious_83: @matrixxcodes Probs passed out from having a needle put in him lol
[4:07:39] MrGattz: hes on his way home.
[4:08:20] itsChiliiii: wait i thoguht he had a lv60 druid also?
[4:08:29] MrGattz: he deleted his druid
[4:08:37] pronkk_: deked druid for name
[4:08:45] pronkk_: deleted*
[4:08:50] Ariea_Whisper: Sacrificed it for the greater good
[4:08:50] itsChiliiii: oh
[4:08:51] Motivess: lvl 60 is gone
[4:09:14] Motivess: 200 hours went poof
[4:09:22] 770Cash: that hurts lol
[4:09:26] 770Cash: but worth for the name
[4:09:40] Holysal: Im OCD. I have to put my characters in Numerical order ☹️
[4:09:45] Clicklesly: I mean, he's presumably getting it back at some point ^^
[4:09:52] Avaricious_83: He will restore it at some point with a new name I think
[4:09:59] Motivess: see that arrow next to create char? he can use it to restore it haha
[4:10:08] AtomicHeartSon: He's confirmed he has no clue how to restore druid and get a new name
[4:10:11] rhodeos_: he has to make a ticket to restore, the paladin having the same name bugged it out
[4:10:38] Ceven_Dust: ceven_dust subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[4:10:39] Sollice: You cant restore a character that you reused the name on right away. I think in retail its what 30 days? Not sure if it is the same in classic
[4:10:41] Shrenko: what is Towelliee doing?
[4:10:54] feherlofia123: whats up , hes been off screen for half an hour
[4:10:57] Runifyoucanz: @Holysal same but i have to put mine in most played to less played XD
[4:11:05] 91Niki: He's getting blood work done
[4:11:11] 91Niki: He should be back pretty soon
[4:11:21] Avaricious_83: Yeah I think you restore it and can't log in on that char until it has been given a new name
[4:11:38] Shrenko: ohhh thanks Niki SeemsGood
[4:11:38] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii

[4:12:03] 91Niki: Yeah I think there is 1 character per 30 days, that you can restore. and if the name is in use you just get asked to rename it
[4:12:15] 91Niki: At least on retail
[4:12:30] yrazu05: chair stream?
[4:12:40] pronkk_: retail is now 1 toon/item per week niki
[4:12:48] 91Niki: Oh okay
[4:12:53] 91Niki: Might be different for classic then
[4:12:59] 91Niki: 🤷
[4:13:02] pronkk_: likely is
[4:13:02] Motivess: wait, so you can basically name change for free?
[4:13:08] 91Niki: Yep :P
[4:13:13] Motivess: rip me
[4:13:16] Avaricious_83: yeah that's what i thought
[4:13:30] Avaricious_83: What do they charge? Like $20?
[4:13:32] Alexakosgg: 2X60 WARRIOR?
[4:13:33] 91Niki: I've done that on retail before
[4:13:46] Motivess: 15$
[4:13:53] Motivess: iirc
[4:13:55] IZemekiSI: yea that is nice to know lol
[4:13:56] Alexakosgg: charge what?
[4:13:58] JcSoldier90: where he go?
[4:14:02] Avaricious_83: Name change
[4:14:25] 91Niki: Just delete the toon you want renamed. Make a new toon with that same name, and then resurrect the toon you want renamed LUL
[4:14:35] 91Niki: Blizz don't snipe me monkaS
[4:14:39] pronkk_: @Motivess is 10 now
[4:14:47] Avaricious_83: Finally we can make some of our money back XD
[4:14:48] IZemekiSI: LUL
[4:14:51] Motivess: still to much haha
[4:15:21] Motivess: especially when you're changing one letter haha
[4:15:25] FutileDiploma: @towelliee who all in here dips? (Tobacco)
[4:15:26] 91Niki: Not sure if they did some changes so you can't do that trick anymore. It worked when I did it like 5 months ago
[4:15:38] Avaricious_83: Now our next plan is to find a way to get free server transfers!!

[4:16:14] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:16:27] IZemekiSI: had to do with coming back to the game
[4:16:48] Avaricious_83: It's all good, we got like 14 years until they release classic again, I am sure we can think of something!
[4:17:14] Motivess: lol, classic shadowlands
[4:17:20] Gotxiko: classic shadowlands let's gooo
[4:17:20] Avaricious_83: IKR
[4:17:33] blowmystick: im looking at the TBC expantion in battle.net store and i still dont know if i should play it, i never played classic vanilla so im thinking of boosting a hunter, any thoughts?
[4:17:36] pronkk_: im ready for corruption round 2!
[4:17:38] IZemekiSI: thing is i think they are slowly using classic to redo the game lol
[4:17:41] pronkk_: go go 8.3.5!
[4:17:59] IZemekiSI: and when classic hits retails content they will pull the plug on retail entirely
[4:18:01] Tekromancy: As long as you don't go MM lol
[4:18:02] Gotxiko: they'll most probably stop at wotlk
[4:18:02] im_clam: where is he lol
[4:18:14] pronkk_: but i want MoP
[4:18:19] pronkk_: they can stop at MoP
[4:18:20] Motivess: @izemekisi redo mistakes post wrath is what I was thinking they could do
[4:18:22] blowmystick: @Tekromancy ofc im gonna play MB if i play
[4:18:27] blowmystick: BM**
[4:18:28] 91Niki: Towelliee tweeted he was on his way home 17min ago
[4:18:33] spinachperson: I don't think there is a lot of demand for anything past wrath tbh
[4:18:34] xViewersunitedx: nobody wants MOP
[4:18:40] Avaricious_83: I think they will stop at Cata because that's when the world change the most
[4:18:40] xViewersunitedx: your just an anomaly
[4:18:47] IZemekiSI: @Motivess yep my thoughts entirely
[4:18:48] G0hard: At what level can you start tanking dungeons as prot paladin?
[4:18:50] xViewersunitedx: a glitch in the matrix
[4:18:51] survivewow: mop class design was poggers
[4:18:53] Gotxiko: just remember, LFG and quest markers on the map were introduced in late woltk, which iwll be at the start of the expansion, wait till those meltdowns
[4:19:00] mmzy_: What if they make wotlk better? No re naxx and azjol nerub raid instead?
[4:19:09] ybaer: @blowmystick hunter is a good choice if u only wanna do PVE hunter kinda bad in pvp
[4:19:10] Motivess: 16 @g0hard
[4:19:23] Tekromancy: They'll keep going as long as there's interest. And with nothing left to do at the end of an expansion, classic or not, people are gonna flock to the "new".
[4:19:27] G0hard: @Motivess  Is that when they get Righteous Fury?
[4:19:32] Motivess: yea
[4:19:34] IZemekiSI: i liked cata but a ton of people hated it and quit , cata also changed the whole raiding thing.
[4:19:36] blowmystick: @ybaer yea, PVE is what i do the most
[4:19:37] G0hard: Thanks
[4:19:53] Gotxiko: blizz just has to wipe out azeroth or reoriginate it for 10.0
[4:19:54] pronkk_: i like how people blame cata for the games decline
[4:19:56] roflpotamus: whered he go?
[4:20:03] JiberishUI: two 60 warriors!?!
[4:20:05] pronkk_: wasnt lfg added into the game in Wrath?

[4:20:05] Tekromancy: Until about 6 months into DS, I enjoyed Cata.
[4:20:07] IZemekiSI: i dont blame it for anything
[4:20:10] 91Niki: He's still there, don't you see him? Kappa
[4:20:11] Atruis_: The disconnect!
[4:20:11] Gotxiko: cata was fun
[4:20:25] Gotxiko: but it was the beginning of "modern wow"
[4:20:26] Avaricious_83: @blowmystick Might be better too boost a Lock or Pala because they boosted char doesn't have much gold and those classes both get a free mount and riding skill
[4:20:31] mmzy_: Queue 50 wait time
[4:20:51] ChalupaBatman25: cata as a whole was awesome, though i do unerstand people not liking that they changed azeroth so much
[4:20:54] Tekromancy: The boost comes with riding skill
[4:20:57] Motivess: LFG is good, don't at me, LFR is not
[4:21:03] J_Cory: lmao every time i enter this stream this dude is afk
[4:21:08] waltoosaa: did he go to bloodwork?
[4:21:13] blowmystick: @Avaricious_83 im pretty sure every class gets a mount and a riding skil
[4:21:14] Avaricious_83: @Tekromancy I mean mounts at 60
[4:21:29] Tekromancy: Yeah, he's on his way home now as of 20 min ago
[4:21:37] mmzy_: Same; everytime i come in, hes gone. Does he even stream?
[4:21:43] pronkk_: @Avaricious_83 you cnat boost a pally on horde
[4:21:45] IZemekiSI: the quality of the player base at end game hanged as well. was too easy to get to raid level. speciall after they added LFR
[4:22:01] Avaricious_83: True but you can have a Lock on horde
[4:22:17] J_Cory: @mmzy_ it blows my mind he has thousands of people watching a disconnected screen
[4:22:35] 770Cash: Its because the chat here is great
[4:22:37] Tekromancy: Mostly just talking lol
[4:23:22] irasin: @J_Cory got my eyes glued to the screen for this riveting content
[4:23:42] Jynt334: you know, have you been here a little bit ago y'all would realize he said he had to go do something

[4:28:00] foxhoundz1: so, will every classic realm be updated to TBC?
[4:28:24] Atruis_: they already were. They split it into TBC and Classic Era
[4:28:27] 91Niki: There he is ! :D
[4:28:31] Avaricious_83: @foxhoundz1 No, when you log a char it asks you to choose which you want your toon on

[4:28:34] Shongoshi: he's back !
[4:28:34] MetallicusGaming: wb
[4:28:35] Draven: @foxhoundz1 From what I can tell, you can choose a BC realm, or remain on the classic realm. Once you choose BC realm, you can't go back to a classic realm, I think?

[5:27:10] DarkSilver66: @SavageELC Not to 1-up, but My pally got 7/9 T3 and End of Dreams last night, lol
[5:27:11] SavageELC: yep looking forward to it
[5:27:12] GalcianBTH: id be happy with my wife even trying wow nvm streaming lol]
[5:27:16] Thunderbrew: When is Lula/Towelliee Co-Stream?
[5:27:31] SavageELC: thats cool @DarkSilver66
[5:27:32] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:27:33] GamerKillance: I wonder how popular TBC will be. Similar to classic launch or better/worse? Not to mention Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis and the ESO expansion comes out this month too
[5:27:36] DarkSilver66: All the Shaman/Druids didn't need their tokens anymore lol
[5:27:36] v_Lano: Are warriors good in tbc? Plan on mainly playing dps, but willing to try tanking
[5:27:41] Kaykerrs: @Thunderbrew howdy stranger
[5:27:43] ProxyXIV: haha I did this last night
[5:27:44] DelcoAF: I would give my left nut if my wife eeever played wow... she's more into bs reality tiv
[5:27:44] neverbornlucky: wait What Towelliee isn't level 70 already
[5:27:45] Wall_ass: Hard to filter through Boosting advertisers for groups FeelsBadMan
[5:27:50] Thunderbrew: Hey @kaykerrs How ya been?
[5:27:58] MasterNeff: Why did you choose to play on such a low pop realm? To avoid spergs?
[5:28:25] Mortis301: I just hit 30 on my blood elf paladin. Nto sure I'll be 58 by next tuesday when it goes live, but I have some hope. Wish we got a month instead of 2 weeks.
[5:28:25] youknowimboolin: It’s not low pop anymore sadge
[5:28:27] GalcianBTH: @GamerKillance I think TBC will go the opposite that classic did, starting out dissapointing from a player count standpoint but growing instead of shrinking over time.
[5:28:38] Paramourn: My ex wouldn't game with me. Claimed he didn't like my types of games, yet I owned a huge amount of the same games he did.
[5:28:54] tebbix: That is the fun!
[5:28:59] gidgeet: I just hit level 11 lol so don't feel bad LUL LUL
[5:29:05] GamerKillance: well other MMO's are also coming out in June. it's gonna be hard for TBC to keep all MMO players this month
[5:29:14] CallMeWallie: Are there a ton of people playing Warcraft TBC like there were in classics
[5:29:15] CallMeWallie: ?
[5:29:22] IZemekiSI: !tbc
[5:29:22] Moobot: @IZemekiSI Prepatch has officially launched! || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || TBC launch is on June 1st
[5:29:33] IZemekiSI: !wa
[5:29:34] Moobot: @IZemekiSI we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[5:29:37] Murlocz: @GamerKillance Its gonna be hard for the other MMOs to get players from TBC lmao
[5:29:40] ExleeTV: were you main tank back in the day?
[5:29:46] GalcianBTH: yea thats my thinking @GamerKillance  It will start slow but as the shine fades on those new games as it always does. TBC will start having its better content released and pick up steam.
[5:29:53] Dino_Munchy: could always solo boost in ZF with your paladin
[5:29:56] 91Niki: @Paramourn Guess there's a reason why he's an ex LUL
[5:30:04] Paramourn: @91Niki  One of the reasons, yes :P
[5:30:35] the_do0d: cant use daggers
[5:30:36] DarkSilver66: Paladin Daggers? Pepega?
[5:30:36] ExleeTV: @Paramourn Similar but diff situation. I'm a gamer but my gf is not. She hates it sadge
[5:30:41] Paramourn: He would brag about having a "gamer girlfriend" but never wanted to game with me lol
[5:30:42] goddard1990: pallys cant use daggerrrrrrs
[5:30:47] GamerKillance: All depends. WoW may be popular, but this is an old re-release. ESO expansion is new and New Genesis is a brand new game with cross platform. To say they're going to be worried about WoW is a bit of a stretch. specially since they aren't sub games like wow
[5:31:19] Paramourn: @ExleeTV  Well, not being a gamer isn't the end all for me, but he also didn't want to hike or anything else I enjoyed doing. Just wasn't any fun.
[5:31:25] 91Niki: @Paramourn Sounds like an ego issue LUL
[5:31:28] GalcianBTH: @GamerKillance I just mean in the sense that every MMO that is not WOW or FF tends to have a big opening followed by people going back to their normal MMO
[5:31:32] gidgeet: Not even close
[5:31:32] TheUnknowing: ESO is nice...but uhh doesnt compete lol
[5:31:33] NateChillyDog: They are worried about new world
[5:31:45] gidgeet: LMAO
[5:31:46] chrslp: Has anyone else not had a new PVP "DAILY" since prepatch launch?
[5:31:49] ImSoBizarre: i went to play eso a couple weeks ago and you have to pay just to be able to store reagents lmao
[5:31:51] mrblond5: The only problem i have with ESO is the combat the rest if like it a lot if not more  then wow
[5:31:52] ChimmyNeutron: @Chillybear56 who is? lol I'll tell you Blizz isn't
[5:31:54] gg_bois11: new world isnt gonna be anything
[5:31:59] GamerKillance: Hey PSO2 New Genesis is a good contender
[5:32:00] gg_bois11: its to diffrent from wow
[5:32:03] rocthenite: but i was told they are worried about ashes
[5:32:10] Thunderbrew: Blizzard needs to put out a better Retail product, then nothing to worry about.
[5:32:11] Bigmansmurf: eso pulling in over 15 million subs apparently. Its big competition
[5:32:11] MisterPooky: nah they worryed about Ashes
[5:32:11] kenzellbtw: new world will be trash
[5:32:12] GamingLasso: didnt protpalas not use spelldmg weap for highest threat?
[5:32:13] GalcianBTH: You know how it will go tho, new world is the shinny new toy, but once people realize its flaws people will go back to their comfort game. Think Wildstar
[5:32:13] NateChillyDog: @ChimmyNeutron New world has the money to push new world like other "wow killers" didnt
[5:32:16] dracullus: I wonder what Blizz has in store for 31st August, maybe Diablo II?
[5:32:19] Paramourn: ESO was fun, but the store shit is so expensive it was a turn off to the game
[5:32:24] TheUnknowing: ashes has nothing to show, they definitely arent worried @rocthenite
[5:32:27] MrTerkyMan: what about old world?
[5:32:29] Arystara: heard new world has a cash shop too
[5:32:31] Necrom93: @chrslp From what I've read, that means you have an eye of the storm daily (which you currently can't do).
[5:32:32] mceslex: Riot games is making an MMO
[5:32:33] ChimmyNeutron: @Chillybear56 Blizzard isn't worried about that game. i can assure you that
[5:32:47] NateChillyDog: @ChimmyNeutron okay, great debate
[5:32:49] GamerKillance: most MMO's have a cash shop
[5:32:56] CallMeWallie: Final fantasy Xiv is going strong though isn’t it?
[5:32:57] GalcianBTH: TBCs success may have more to do with how bad Retail is more so then any other MMO
[5:33:00] DelcoAF: @Chillybear56 lol
[5:33:01] Alienfromger: swords of legends looks interesting too
[5:33:08] ExMachineGamer: towelliee does a boosted char get any rep? or none? just wondering or does anyone here knows?
[5:33:29] GamerKillance: Retail sucking right now could either help or hinder TBC classic release
[5:33:32] dracullus: maybe 9.1.5 will have something cool like Deaths of Chromie
[5:33:43] GalcianBTH: can see it now Tier 5 released the day before it.
[5:33:49] rocthenite: tuesday
[5:33:49] jamarky23: Nah shadowlands is fuked and the next two big patches is gonna be shit i think
[5:33:56] No_Panda: @GalcianBTH true
[5:33:57] rocthenite: the tuesday before thanksgiving
[5:34:19] blackgeezus: 19th early access
[5:34:22] dracullus: @Towelliee you still surprised after all these years?
[5:34:23] GalcianBTH: That is why Ive been saying it will be a slow start for TBC
[5:34:24] magemaster225: raid wont be out till end of july though
[5:34:34] GamerKillance: Shadowlands isn't bad, but the issue is the severe lack of content
[5:34:34] ChimmyNeutron: @Chillybear56 LUL
[5:34:35] mrkenndy: asa  hunter ill actually raid lol (i want the bow and quiver lol)
[5:34:38] ProxyXIV: raidlogging kek
[5:34:40] GalcianBTH: but once 9.1s gloss fades more and more will dable in TBC
[5:34:43] warrenny: Tbh kinda done with 9.p fot bc
[5:35:01] CallMeWallie: Is now a good time to jump into retail to catch up before the next big raid drop?
[5:35:08] mceslex: so, is Sylvanas going to die in the story?
[5:35:08] Gizimoo86: bro i am smashing leves 45 shaman without boostin, trying tomorrow to hit 50
[5:35:14] A_Klimas: did they announce the patch date?
[5:35:19] bambitay22: OH  the nostalgia in this temple
[5:35:19] GamerKillance: no
[5:35:21] yaycolin: Did they officially announce release date for 9.1?
[5:35:25] IAmAntonyJ: @Gizimoo86 Gz mate. Keep it up.
[5:35:34] GalcianBTH: And TBC is far easier to get into and enjoy coming in late then Classic is.

[5:35:52] rhodeos_: do you like making fuck BESERKERRRR
[5:35:59] Th3Hammer: ahahaha shit
[5:36:08] dracullus: @yaycolin that always happens week-two before patch
[5:36:09] ChimmyNeutron: Seriously, the endless power grind actually kept you constantly logging in everyday
[5:36:14] Aravarth: "Did he just say 'Making fuck'?"
[5:36:15] Gizimoo86: @struxii thx yea i like it, its faster and way more quests overall
[5:36:16] Motivess: if you had endless content in retail then you wouldn't have as much time for BC
[5:36:16] warrenny: @galcianbth Tbh im hyped for tbc problem is im level 33 on the char i want to main
[5:36:26] Stangin2122: 15 bucks little man....
[5:36:28] GalcianBTH: one of classics issues was that its systems and its players had the attitude of if you were not here day one you should just quit and go back to retail.
[5:36:30] GamerKillance: ya TBC is much easier in terms of difficulty. we're going to have the classic crowd screaming from the roof than TBC is the hardest things and casuals won't kill bosses. lol
[5:36:45] IAmAntonyJ: @Gizimoo86 Yup. It's super fun. My Alliance shaman is now 53.
[5:36:50] ZagFan590: To me, 9.1 does really solve alot of its core issues. One being outside of M+ and Raid there's really no content. World content is pointless now that there is now AP tied to to WQs ect...
[5:37:00] GamerKillance: Gonna be a classic scenario where bosses get downed in 1 week
[5:37:01] Gizimoo86: @struxii wow nice lvl
[5:37:01] rhodeos_: best part of TBC is that the content is sequential. Meaning there should, in theory, always be some group running whichever content is relevant for you
[5:37:08] GalcianBTH: It would take alot to pull me to retail in the next 4 years.
[5:37:18] akia03: farm korthia

[5:37:45] GamerKillance: lolno
[5:37:54] Broomba: @towelliee -- are there many different flavors to Stroopwafels and if so what is your fav one?
[5:37:57] warrenny: @slothiest No covid fucked it up
[5:37:59] PvtHudson093: the usual sockets and conduits
[5:38:02] GamerKillance: Retail development isn't harmed by classic in the slightest
[5:38:04] GalcianBTH: @slothiest Naw, they would much rather everyone play retail. Far more money to be made.
[5:38:07] Aravarth: I mean, you COULD be a bald mountfarming Andy Kappa
[5:38:23] Aravarth: jk don't do that lul
[5:38:30] slothiest: I’m just being a conspiracy andy over here.
[5:38:31] Motivess: asmonStare

[5:38:59] CrusaderNero: I rather level every char 1-70 in classic bc than take part in retail max level content
[5:39:04] ScriptzSB: 58-60 left on the pala today HYPERS
[5:39:10] youknowimboolin: Man I really wanna have my pally 60 by BC but it’s just impossible for my schedule

[5:39:50] itsChiliiii: xp is xp
[5:40:08] Broomba: @diathi123 yummy! Might have try it
[5:40:09] MrTerkyMan: say what you will about BfA, soundtrack was killer (as usual)
[5:40:34] youknowimboolin: @motivess I’m low on gold :( otherwise I’d just buy infinite boosts
[5:40:35] SonofHorus82: @MrTerkyMan mos def. The Boralus song gets me jazzed up.
[5:40:47] ZagFan590: Not wrong.
[5:40:56] MrTerkyMan: I didn't hate BfA. My guild went on hiatus after Eternal Palace though cause a lot of folks just hated it
[5:40:56] penqun: Big true
[5:41:00] akia03: are islands soloable now already?
[5:41:04] MrTerkyMan: @SonofHorus82 100%. Love it
[5:41:06] F_L_A_K_E_: mechagon is one of the best zones in wow imo
[5:41:09] Maruika: i skipped 8.2 and the first month back was the worst
[5:41:14] CrusaderNero: yeah I dropped out early in 8.2, ruined rest of BfA
[5:41:16] ChalupaBatman25: legion was /chefs kiss
[5:41:18] ChimmyNeutron: 8.2 was a great patch
[5:41:19] L1ghthoof: @diathi123 cant solo que for them
[5:41:23] Kinghorn: I skipped 8.2 but had friends to help me catch up
[5:41:28] lianddre: I dno man, played since launch till the end. It was so horrible. Only gd patch was BoD
[5:41:43] youknowimboolin: I liked BFA a lot, I kinda miss the corruption system. Had a lot of fun blasting mythic 15s
[5:41:48] Priya_Plays: I can confirm: I skipped 8.2 in BFA and coming back took me AGES to catch up
[5:41:51] akia03: @L1ghthoof oh thought they were adding that ingame

[5:42:24] warrenny: @mecabeast Honestly saw essences and noped out plus azshara was shit
[5:42:24] PvtHudson093: Anyone know why MMOC changed the page colour?
[5:42:32] Bixster: i was great for players that wanted to play mainly their mains
[5:42:36] Priya_Plays: I was so useless for weeks. I'm not a bad healer but i was SO hamstrung just trying to play at the same level
[5:42:43] Gotxiko: holy dmg
[5:42:46] warrenny: Loved bod tho
[5:42:56] stallowned: i liked BFA but quit after mythic ashara. that fight was pretty rough
[5:43:06] Shiekrunner: I liked Bfa for what it was obviously there are always aspects i think could be better
[5:43:06] Oneeye2cu: Oneeye2cu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[5:43:17] Wildside1177: Yours is better
[5:43:17] BluesteelHD: your 1her def better id say
[5:43:18] Gizimoo86: yeah i bought 46 lvl 2 x 1h maces for my shaman only 40g
[5:43:18] Shiekrunner: *have been
[5:43:25] Mecabeast: yeah I stopped when 8.2 launched and came back halfway through 8.3
[5:43:29] Wildside1177: The proc is shite
[5:43:29] Kruzemissile: prob not worth it
[5:43:30] ZagFan590: For a casual, there was alot of content to do in BFA compared to SL.
[5:43:34] kingceejay90: Plus Sanctuary
[5:43:36] Envythisnoob: not worth
[5:43:46] Arystara: LUL
[5:43:47] kingceejay90: Increase holy dmg no?
[5:43:48] Motivess: healing has become more of a sustain game then hitting huge numbers, a huge turn off for me
[5:43:53] Motivess: in retail
[5:43:56] akia03: isnt it lowest roll wins
[5:44:01] Zettabyte: 1 roll to rule them all ;)
[5:44:01] Paramourn: golf rules
[5:44:02] SonofHorus82: Honestly, there isnt a single xpac where I'm like "This xpac sucks!" I like some of them a lot better than others (TBC, WotLK, MoP, Legion), but there isn't an xpac that I genuinely dislike.
[5:44:08] micahmckittrick: As a casual, I think SL has too much to do. I can't seem to keep up
[5:44:15] rxdderz_: i've not played SL since december, cant wait for TBC tho :D
[5:44:19] ChimmyNeutron: @SonofHorus82 I'm the same way for the most part as well
[5:44:39] Arystara: lol
[5:44:40] Kruzemissile: gold rules
[5:44:43] Kruzemissile: golf*
[5:44:49] ChimmyNeutron: It's hard replaying the SL content on alts imo. I've hated leveling alts
[5:44:53] Priya_Plays: I haven't played since I think around thanksgiving. Guild was full of try-hards and the game wasn't rewarding anymore
[5:45:05] dracullus: well it's still WoW after all
[5:45:06] Kruzemissile: WOD had good raids
[5:45:07] Arystara: I liked questing in wod
[5:45:13] Arystara: and the raids
[5:45:14] MasterNeff: The raids and zones were great.
[5:45:18] Wildside1177: Draenor was good. Just not ewnough of it.

[5:45:30] jamarky23: Tbh SL takes 1st place. its utter shit unreal how bad it is
[5:45:32] Kruzemissile: its time between content was freaking awful
[5:45:34] Furaian: The selfie cam wasn't filler content? Kappa
[5:45:35] SonofHorus82: SELFIE Cam patch is the best patch of all time.
[5:45:40] johnnboitoi: WOD had a ton of cut content too... :/
[5:45:42] Arystara: true @Wildside1177
[5:45:43] Aro725: I feel like the gave up on SL too
[5:45:44] MasterNeff: They gave up and went all in on legion
[5:45:45] Jermo11: SL is pretty bad
[5:45:48] harpdarp: WoD Classic they should finish the exp PogU
[5:45:52] micahmckittrick: haha forgot about that selfie cam
[5:45:53] warrenny: Wod was when i started normal raiding sooo yeah decent but didnt play much of it
[5:45:54] Broomba: WoD different have Desolace ;)
[5:45:54] dracullus: they gave up even before launch when they started cuting stuff
[5:46:02] miniomniculturistical: maybe they were working on legion
[5:46:05] Broomba: WoD didnt have Desolace ;)
[5:46:10] Kruzemissile: if those new employees didnt know the blizzard ways they somehow made amazing raids and they need to pay them more lol
[5:46:17] slothiest: I actually really like garrisons nowadays as just filler content. But they were rough back then for mats.
[5:46:20] DamnJester: i will forever dislike WoD cuz it was the end of 10man raiding :(
[5:46:26] Collected1: WoD still has the best expansion cinematic
[5:46:30] kokochris: Lol I remember when they said " dont worry we got this"
[5:46:31] ChalupaBatman25: first 3 months of wod was AMAZING but there was 0 post launch content excluding raids. that's why i can't defend wod imo almost doesn't qualify as an expansion to me tbh
[5:46:45] johnnboitoi: I really would mind seeing them expand on Classic. Like that raid portal in Stratholme
[5:46:52] jamarky23: Lets look past the drought and lack of endgame content outside of raids. WoD had a thousand times more soul than SL had
[5:47:00] johnnboitoi: wouldn't*
[5:47:05] Octavian360: @Towelliee Legion best expan since WotLK
[5:47:12] Motivess: @jamarky23 agree 100
[5:47:14] wafflerboss: also every WoD raid is 10x better than nathria
[5:47:17] Drixan: Stay hydrated friends.
[5:47:20] shimwood: RIP doggos
[5:47:21] MasterNeff: Was worth it. Legion was awesome imo
[5:47:23] ArcaneSyntax: man after grinding out 40k honor for the hwl weapons the gear is easy to farm
[5:47:28] warrenny: @jamarky23 So look past everythin* and claim soul is a thin* for games?
[5:47:36] ChalupaBatman25: they did expand on classic, its called tbc
[5:47:36] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:47:38] Broomba: WoD philosophy and system was either not planned out well or failed 1/2 into implementing it for whatever reason
[5:47:44] Motivess: wasn't it 100 million?
[5:47:47] dracullus: @Towelliee imo Legion supposed to launch before WoD, but Blizz switched them to promote movie.. that was delayed anyway, so WoD was underdeveloped and Legion overdeveloped
[5:47:48] BluesteelHD: idk id guess classic+classic tbc has more players than retail
[5:47:52] johnnboitoi: Well if not expanding on it, it'd be cool to at least learn what was originally planned.
[5:47:54] GamerKillance: Classic is fucking dead lel
[5:47:59] Shiekrunner: i would love to get a mop or cata doubt it will happen tho
[5:48:20] akia03: for me legion was the only xpac that got me to stop playing
[5:48:21] GamerKillance: Hey classic peeps what happened to classic lasting forever because it was a godsend? lol cmon where ya guys at
[5:48:23] jamarky23: @warrenny  Ofc Soul is a thing ingames its what makes a good rpg. I dont think you understand the context of the word then
[5:48:23] AtomicHeartSon: @johnnboitoi It's been confirmed the raid portal in Strath was originally meant to lead to Naxx, like how BRD lead to MC and UBRS lead to BWL
[5:48:40] eatclentrenh: @bluesteelhd not even close bud
[5:48:40] Motivess: I'd play cata, not a fan of MoP though
[5:48:51] johnnboitoi: @AtomicHeartSon oh word. That's pretty cool then
[5:48:57] Wildside1177: Violet Targan
[5:49:02] warrenny: @motivess Mop was great
[5:49:18] magemaster225: classic+ after wrath, lets gooo

[5:49:23] Shiekrunner: fresh servers Kreygasm
[5:49:25] Zaharial: i hope they stop at wrath and instead make + content
[5:49:26] dracullus: somehow I doubt
[5:49:27] Zippaya: lich king next?
[5:49:29] Motivess: MoP has some of the worst dungeons
[5:49:31] Shiekrunner: a level speedrun Kreygasm
[5:49:36] harpdarp: fresh classic> fresh TBC>fresh classic infinite
[5:49:40] SonofHorus82: I hope so. Then their communities will go with them too.
[5:49:45] Kruzemissile: do they plan on doing new classic servers?
[5:49:46] kingceejay90: What does a fresh server do?
[5:49:49] Shiekrunner: fresh servers are super fun
[5:49:49] Aravarth: lol they will never ever ever make Classic + after WotLK, people who think so are deluding themselves
[5:49:52] Miguel85NYC: think they will release expansions for classic? make it a alternate universe?
[5:49:56] GamerKillance: They openly said Classic+ is NOT GOING TO HAPPEN so stop harping on that
[5:49:59] eatclentrenh: @devilspire spine wasn't in mop
[5:50:00] Bixster: just like new D3 seasons
[5:50:01] FaceMcShooty: i mean to be honest. after wotlk is out what holds them to do the cycle all over again?
[5:50:03] DamnJester: yea but is it big deal for the people watching the stream
[5:50:03] youknowimboolin: Fresh servers means all our toons get reset to 1?
[5:50:04] MetallicusGaming: Miguel85NYC no lol
[5:50:05] ScriptzSB: most players from pservers dont like naxx tier they just like to replay all the other content
[5:50:08] Furaian: Fresh TBC server would be great

[5:50:23] Motivess: @gamerkillance they openly said classic wasn't gonna happen, now look at us
[5:50:32] ChalupaBatman25: @creativeceejay fresh servers are just brand new servers where everyone starts from scratch. like fresh economy there are no lvl 60's etc

[5:50:58] warrenny: Id try it tbh
[5:51:03] Gruntejoss: Been leveling to 60 in vanilla and 70 in tbc servers like 25 times
[5:51:03] GamerKillance: A re-release is different than creating new content. Classic+ isn't happening so get over it already.
[5:51:17] ChalupaBatman25: @strayfellow the journey is the reward till they sit in dungeons for the entire leveling experience lol yeah "journey"
[5:51:18] CrusaderNero: man I barely managed to get my pala to 60 during classic
[5:51:25] GamerKillance: tbc was the response to classic+ lel
[5:51:50] Shiekrunner: the initial launch experience is where it's at everyone starting at the same time and having a good time
[5:51:50] Motivess: okay bro, you work at blizz? @gamerkillance
[5:52:07] Shiekrunner: ^
[5:52:12] Priya_Plays: @GamerKillance Mmm blizz also said that classic would never happen rofl
[5:52:23] Shiekrunner: and for speed levelers its fun as well it's like a new race starts
[5:52:25] Freakzene: And on a fresh no one is able to get lvl boosted, for a little while
[5:52:37] generalmarcus35: they could have a thing where Chromie goes back in time and the Dreanei never come to Azeroth...  and we dont open the Dark Portal again. Classic +
[5:52:43] ChalupaBatman25: for me classic era wow was just getting to experience OG azeroth again. its a completely different game than current retail. BUT it was a waiting room for tbc cause that's when i started raiding
[5:52:47] acidhue0: When you had to read quest logs
[5:52:50] pixxelina: oh yeah
[5:52:53] GamerKillance: Do you? You guys are the ones who keep bringing up that nonsense saying it will happen when they said it won't. TBC is the response to that crap. By all means prove me wrong. Man ya'll are toxic af
[5:52:55] rickstar2: How’s it going towel?
[5:52:57] Aravarth: I just wish Blizzard did a much better job of version archiving their original code

[5:53:53] Kruzemissile: i think its just classic players in general not just private servers

[5:54:51] Aravarth: @Kyrrua I mean, that's why I like "official" servers, TOS are enforced and you don't have to put up with racist bullshit
[5:54:52] jamarky23: Yeah true
[5:54:52] Notsure770: Wasn't "Nostalrius" before Light's Hope?

[5:56:51] neverbornlucky: raid shadow legend channel more toxic then wow
[5:56:52] korver_: Imagine being an adult over the age of 18 and complaining about a boost LOL. Kids....most adults don't have/don't want to have the time to play a SUPER unimportant part of the game. Leveling is literally a joke. The whole point of the game that is there for you to enjoy is MAX LEVEL STUFF. So....if you have a job...and don't wanna legit WASTE your time. You boost. Simple as that.

[5:58:33] MasterNeff: Most private server classic players are just so socially inept and unaware.
[5:58:33] SonofHorus82: they still do that shit in their discords. Discord needs a better way to put an end to that.
[5:58:33] Seerated: When they have one place they can't act out, it'll get 10 times worse in the place they actually can without repercussions

[6:20:07] Shrenko: and a huge mistake probably too
[6:20:15] FranciscoTheMage: what about that dude sodapoppin. i went to front page for the first time in a long time and he popped up and he wasn't even playing this wow classic stuff
[6:20:16] BlackCl0ud: @L1ghthoof wtf where
[6:20:16] crawcook: It's a good game for talking streams like Asmon says :D
[6:20:21] Zettabyte: glad you didn't go variety @Towelliee :)
[6:20:23] SavageCheez: @CeradwynTheMage Changed his streamer name to BigMan Outdoors. Occasionally streams in the afternoon
[6:20:34] ZagFan590: Being a Variety streamer and a WoW streamer is tough.
[6:20:39] SmuttBudgie: You need Early access to stuff to hopefully break into varierty
[6:20:47] L1ghthoof: @BlackCl0ud just search his name on twitch
[6:20:52] RavenARPG: @Towelliee oh wow you thought to switch to variety during WoD, I watch you since forever basically so interesting to know for me
[6:21:16] ZagFan590: Because WoW requires a large time commitment if you raid and you would be forced to miss all the new hype variety games.

[6:24:17] Lazugo: Now mes just do community rbgs with us
[6:24:17] ChalupaBatman25: so mad twitch purges vods, when tbc prepatch launched wanted to go back and watch some classic launch vods as background noise as i leveled
[6:24:18] ofnaldreya: He's cracked
[6:24:19] mrkenndy: @Towelliee watched cohh a bit for biomutant and he even admited it needs more time
[6:24:21] Aravarth: I imagine it's feast or famine
[6:24:22] zgag: Like him or hate them. Athene is still around and is one of the originals.  Along with Boogie
[6:24:33] Mecabeast: looks like it was geared towards a younger audience but has a system that's too complicated
[6:24:33] dalaraz: he is so full of energy
[6:24:35] saypex_g: Weird question but SL or TBC (For casual playing) didn't play wow for a year now i want to back cuz  watching Towelliee lol
[6:24:39] faulen: it's like PoE stramers
[6:24:47] cahoots82: He's a beast, but he's also just clowning on people below his level most of the stream.
[6:24:50] FranciscoTheMage: did Quinn quit wow? he was very fun to watch
[6:24:57] Arystara: wow pvp psychic lol
[6:25:10] zgag: Quinn not a huge fan of SL

[6:28:58] Zettabyte: he needs to have the leveling experience, the integrity of WoW Kappa
[6:29:04] ZagFan590: I feel like Sloot is a bit burned out on WoW at the moment. Which is understandable.
[6:29:10] miriones: escort quests so fun..
[6:29:13] Mecabeast: all my watch time is towelliee asmon and max lol
[6:29:13] ZagFan590: Trying to get his variety time in before 9.1
[6:29:19] Eviltuna13: I don’t know what to boost. Right now I’m leveling a hunter
[6:29:25] nocturrno: dude i would wake up at like 4am or whatever during legion and watch those early ass streams lol
[6:29:50] harpdarp: Future is dead?
[6:30:02] Dawneskye: I watch like all of 4 wow streamers, lol

[6:31:09] jasperboy: WF star augur tho
[6:31:19] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee when do you use the rank 1 consacrate and when do you use the higher rank ?
[6:31:21] CritcobainTV: Little bit of weight off his shoulders. it must be nice to have a break in those terms @Towelliee
[6:31:30] Uther_The_Lightbringer: he is grinder  he will be fine
[6:31:35] LHaxorP: guild stuff sucks... only  playing your guy good

[6:49:01] andycoin99: What does RAM actually do?

[7:27:31] Eraste: and honestly, the gear is bad, but i tested a lot of the boosted classes on beta and it wasn't really bad at all, so you can muscle through it

[7:29:10] DonSombrero: how else are we going to be able to clear 15 year old content ?

[8:21:28] 32shades_ofdark: Introducing the streamer AARP plan lol
[8:21:33] IZemekiSI: but thats because AARP used to have a military only section and my ex wife got it under her dad
[8:21:40] Wildside1177: Most medical conditions have at least some factor of causation from genetic disposition.
[8:21:49] Seathasky: What about your vape @Towelliee
[8:21:53] Seathasky: wont that affect you?
[8:22:25] PotbellyGoat: Potbelly_Goat gifted a Tier 1 sub to Lasidor! They have given 26 Gift Subs in the channel!

[8:23:04] mrblond5: depends from your genes man my granpa  smoked from when he  was 14   he died on 103
[8:23:10] dillapuss: so wait did your fam move straight to cali or did they stop in miami first? miami local asking lol
[8:23:12] Atruis_: Even going outside is bad for you
[8:23:14] Seathasky: @Totemkatsu a lot of contraversy surrounding it tbh, no one really knows
[8:23:14] Lasidor: @Potbelly_Goat Thanks for the gift sub! Thats awesome!
[8:23:15] Baltickat: you need to kill the hydromancer that is close to the gong on the other side of the dng
[8:23:18] Totemkatsu: look into it, vaping isnt much better than cigarettes
[8:23:22] Baltickat: you dont need to do the event
[8:23:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah just skip the stairs
[8:23:41] SuperRyedog: weed cures your lungs Kappa
[8:23:53] Seathasky: @Totemkatsu i disagree
[8:23:53] Atruis_: Cigs have way more bad chems in it than vape in just the filter alone.
[8:24:04] Wildside1177: Hydromancer has the second tablet part. She is where you summon Gaz.
[8:24:23] lBruxno: let the man puff in peace lfmao
[8:24:27] Lasidor: Putting things in your lungs other than oxygen is "not good", live life how you wanna.
[8:24:31] TheCliffyShow: Towelliee isn't some dumb kid trying to look cool.
[8:24:35] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i was born in the bronx, not too far from jersey lol
[8:24:36] Seathasky: @Totemkatsu theres like 3 chemicals in vapes and god knows how many in cigs bro lol
[8:24:53] Atruis_: @Seathasky at least 500
[8:24:54] andycoin99: We’re all trying to quit smoking
[8:24:56] Dethmetalhed: thats some scarface shit right there
[8:24:59] Totemkatsu: @Seathasky you can disagree, but look at the higher amounts of nicotine peopel are getting from vapes. its not good for you
[8:25:03] Liamhys2017: I'm confused by classic (yeah big poggers I'm a retailer). I just cant get over the lack of QoL features like group finder (Although it is flawed) and quest markings and such.
[8:25:16] PotbellyGoat: @critcobain I as born in Patchogue Long Island
[8:25:17] dillapuss: lol Newark born here too
[8:25:18] BJofBorg: Ain't none of us getting out of here alive so.....
[8:25:23] VeranuTree: @Totemkatsu He's literally vaping 0 nicotine
[8:25:39] Totemkatsu: then whats the point of vaping
[8:25:44] Seathasky: @Totemkatsu i mean most people vape 3mg or less, i find that hard to believe
[8:25:46] Totemkatsu: if there's no nicotine
[8:25:49] No_Panda: @liamhys2017 get questie for quests
[8:25:50] Vowels_tv: @Towelliee yoo keep chating...how about an F u ALTUVE! i went to the first game houston was in bronx for my bday at beginning of may was so much fun. voice ggone after 2nd inning
[8:26:03] jerexify: @Totemkatsu It's not good for you. Breathing pure oxygen isn't good for you either. I can point you to studies showing vaping is 95% safer than cigarettes. Is it completely safe? Nope. Neither is walking out your front door. Chill out about it, and let people make their own decisions.
[8:26:11] MattGorin: @totemkatsu i agree, vapes can have more nicotine. But nicotine is not what damages your healthj, it just keeps you addicted. The other chemicals damage your health
[8:26:16] imhankey: what addon do you use for minimap?
[8:26:21] Seathasky: @jerexify ^
[8:26:34] Eraste: @Liamhys2017 Ya I feel ya. There's a lot of QoL I wish classic had. But for most of us (at least for me personally), messing around in classic is playing a game with heart and soul, which (imo) retail has none anymore

[8:27:02] No_Panda: it's elvui
[8:27:08] DreadMz: How's tanking in tbc with paladin?
[8:27:15] Totemkatsu: frogot twitch chat is filled with sjw's that defend bad habits my bad
[8:27:37] Eraste: well that escalated quickly danKEK
[8:27:46] w00droh: @Totemkatsu everyone has bad habbits and vices, let them have them
[8:27:46] Freakzene: LUL
[8:27:55] jerexify: @Totemkatsu Play the victim much? Fuck outta here.
[8:27:55] Liamhys2017: @Liamhys2017 I can understand that feeling a bit I guess. I definitly play retail for the End Game and that's pretty much it. it's the best MMO for raids and dungeons. That has enjoyable combat to me
[8:27:57] cbiskit89: towelliee is a grown ass man if he wants to vape and put in the research let him live his life @Totemkatsu
[8:28:01] MattGorin: @totemkatsu not defending, just stating facts. Its much better not to do it at all. Im a smoker and trying to quit
[8:28:24] TotalAustin: Where are you going after zf??
[8:28:25] PotbellyGoat: towPurple
[8:28:26] AtomicHeartSon: Smothing ANYTHING is bad for you. Smoke is bad for your lungs. If someone knows that and does it anyways, that's their choice.
[8:28:34] nolorand: im thankful for vaping. used to smoke cigs. ppl just dont understand

[8:28:44] Kaykerrs: You do you @totemkatsu. People can live their lives as they please.
[8:28:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: i have a bad habit of being on twitch all day while im at work
[8:28:49] w00droh: @wilky82 same and agreed
[8:28:55] Eraste: @Liamhys2017 Totally agree with you. I still play retail first, but it's nice taking some time to play classic and feel the love that went in to it. Retail is just kind of a revenue generating algorithm now days. It's a better game, technically, but ya
[8:28:55] Toasty_SW: vape helped me quit on day one.....
[8:29:03] Camtully: I'm smoking right now, am I in trouble? LUL
[8:29:07] Freakzene: The only good thing about smoking is, that it forces me to get up from my chair
[8:29:14] NinjaGlovz: Even MOP?
[8:29:22] UhhNadda: yeah the downranking is a bitch for someone new imo
[8:29:33] BamfHoss: downranking adds alot too
[8:29:33] Liamhys2017: @Eraste Have you ever played LOTRO?
[8:29:34] QQisLIVE: I only press Life Tap and Shadow Bolt
[8:29:45] BamfHoss: healers got the hard life
[8:29:48] Toasty_SW: lotro was fun
[8:30:18] Eraste: @Liamhys2017 I haven't, no. WoW has basically been the only mmo ive played. A bit of SWTOR back in the day and ESO when expansions drop, but thats about it. Also not a big fan of lotr so theres that, too
[8:30:31] mrblond5: maybe is this  spec i am playing LUL
[8:30:44] xkayne: Just tuned in. Are you just dungeon farming Towelliee?
[8:30:45] zack68: You are not taking much damage either. You get mana for damage healed

[8:31:04] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: 61 dungeon spellpowerweapon
[8:31:20] Liamhys2017: My problem with Lotro is the combat and the quests. The combat feels like its 2004, hella clunky. That's where WoW reigns supreme i think, it changed to be quick enough to be fun to smash and have good interactions....also lotro is the epitamy of run there collect come back, go back and kill and come back..like my god
[8:31:27] kingceejay90: Best 1h to get at 50 that’s not flurry axe (not spending 200g for it)
[8:31:33] kingceejay90: For paladin?
[8:31:36] kingceejay90: Chat help
[8:31:56] Chiraakitteh: Take off your pants for mana!!!!
[8:32:13] Liamhys2017: Part of the reason I can't get into classic is the fact that I hate auto-attacking xD and my god that's half of Classic
[8:32:18] Chiraakitteh: I believe that’s the traditional correction when you aren’t taking enough damage
[8:32:20] Seathasky: @Towelliee you using threat plates?
[8:32:36] Seathasky: word
[8:32:39] FatTown: do Paladins have the Gain mana after getrting healed from other players yet?

[8:51:59] jkitchin75: its 60k gold for a hc
[8:52:00] xkennenx: cutting edge is roughly 2.5 million
[8:52:01] CritcobainTV: they're talking about mythic, not heroic LUL
[8:52:02] GonoFPS: @chrisvilla009 aotc yeah, ce is like 4Mil
[8:52:02] paulcernik: its not astronomical for all, and you can save 100$ each patch and get your cutting edge each 2 years... p2w in my opinion
[8:52:03] kdread009: ooh mythic
[8:52:03] saacman2000: oh shit
[8:52:04] byrom88: 4.5mill 10/10 mythic
[8:52:05] CritcobainTV: fucking casuals
[8:52:06] ayyclay: he must mean aotc
[8:52:06] hrdstylem: yeh 70k is heroic lol
[8:52:09] Toasty_SW: no no
[8:52:10] kdread009: yeaa AOTC
[8:52:14] probablystonedtwitchuser: it was 5,5m for last 3 bosses
[8:52:15] Shrenko: imagine paying for HC kill LUL
[8:52:31] byrom88: 50k for heroic sire on eu

[8:52:36] nilachip: what is AOTC ?
[8:52:37] GonoFPS: now its like 1 000
[8:52:39] Toasty_SW: ...
[8:52:53] saacman2000: hey i buy it
[8:52:54] GonoFPS: aotc is ahead of the curve
[8:52:54] xkennenx: and the odds of the items being your actual good stats are kinda low
[8:52:55] IZemekiSI: still missing the skill
[8:52:59] ToxicBardMain: the amount you have to put in is also so astronomical its not even remotely worth it even for whales
[8:53:00] Macroversal_: then they need to do that again next content patch
[8:53:02] Shallo1988: if you have that much gold arnt you playing a lot and you should be good at the game to do it yourself.
[8:53:02] Seathasky: Towellie gets it
[8:53:03] Toasty_SW: same for the pvpers that get 2100 rating or higher
[8:53:03] wafflerboss: you are buying transmogs nothing wrong with cosmetics imo
[8:53:04] swordart_19: For transmogg
[8:53:08] Berexios123: those people show all the gearin heroic dungeons haha
[8:53:13] hammack52: im sorry but if you are buying a mythic boss kill, you really should just stop playing the game, cause your not really playing it already
[8:53:16] TwitchBasu: its pay to do better, or pay to skip stuff, save time I guess
[8:53:16] saacman2000: flex
[8:53:16] Mitchendo64: Blizzard should just sell gear bundles and conquest points on the store.
[8:53:32] probablystonedtwitchuser: i buy mythic raid boosts for my alts if im thinking about rerolling or want new geared char to boost keys with
[8:53:33] ChimmyNeutron: @clowncheng lol
[8:53:37] Toasty_SW: point is...  ppl are doing it and its more obvious than ever
[8:53:45] probablystonedtwitchuser: its usually 5-8 bis items
[8:53:47] skaya86: @clowncheng said one single person who doesnt play the game
[8:53:55] hammack52: no classic is just different its not better
[8:53:56] GonoFPS: guys you always could buy runs
[8:53:56] jkitchin75: @clowncheng ofc it is lol
[8:53:57] Seathasky: @clowncheng for raiding retail will always dominate over classic, everything else no
[8:54:05] GonoFPS: my guild use to sell carries in fireland
[8:54:05] Samoa92: @clowncheng Thats not true at all i hate classic
[8:54:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: no caverns of time port from shattrath at the start of tbc
[8:54:06] bmi86: @Towelliee also its a symbiotic existence. the raiders need the farmers to be able to get the concumeable and the gold. and the need the raiders for the gear and such
[8:54:08] Eraste: i mean, ive been devoted to retail for ever but 9.0 has really crushed my spirit and its hard to look forward to future content atm
[8:54:09] GonoFPS: it was AlwaYs a thing
[8:54:11] boraq: @Towelliee I do it because I got the golds, like what else do I do with my millions of gold?
[8:54:13] Macroversal_: @hammack52 Agree to disagree. What if I just want like a mount run or something but I don't raid? There are different ways to play this game.
[8:54:28] Toasty_SW: and   lets face it.... what do ppl do with all that gold they farm endlessly
[8:54:29] probablystonedtwitchuser: like what else i would do with all the money i get from boosting keys all day :D
[8:54:44] GonoFPS: win - win situation
[8:54:52] GonoFPS: if you really look at it it's aint bad tbh
[8:55:08] Toasty_SW: yeah but the game is ruined
[8:55:15] skaya86: @Toasty_SW sell it
[8:55:17] wafflerboss: "game is ruined" no lol
[8:55:18] skaya86: for money
[8:55:26] Toasty_SW: hard to find good players to run content  when everyone gets boosted and cant play
[8:55:33] Toasty_SW: pve/pve alike
[8:55:38] Sandman_88: cause no patches came out
[8:55:42] xmedpakx: maybe dont play then?
[8:55:46] TheGaoSora: will you keep hoping back and forth TBCC and retail once TBCC finishes it's content cycle?
[8:55:47] xideontv: you killed mythic sire, here take a conduit
[8:55:50] xkennenx: i mean its hard to find good p layers regardless if they pay or not
[8:55:51] crawcook: gearing is fun in classic,
[8:55:52] Toasty_SW: @skaya86  yeah and get banned?
[8:55:53] wafflerboss: no one is having problems with boosted characters you are just finding bad players @Toasty_SW
[8:55:55] Seathasky: classic andys dont understand retail and think raiding is lfr and that classic raiding is actually hard lol
[8:55:58] Seathasky: because most are casuals
[8:56:01] Kinghorn: you just need to get 20 scourgestones
[8:56:06] Kinghorn: then talk to sylvanas
[8:56:12] JonnyScotland: @Seathasky pretty much
[8:56:15] xmedpakx: i like classic and retail, i lik all wow, retail is bring atm for sure
[8:56:16] Wildside1177: At least 5 quests
[8:56:23] xmedpakx: boring**
[8:56:32] Seathasky: i like wow period
[8:56:32] Toasty_SW: dealing with carried players is the worst experience ever and you cant tell me otherwise
[8:56:34] xideontv: is sylvanas still a night elf in TBC?
[8:56:35] Seathasky: both have something to offer
[8:57:12] FerociouzMonk: raiding is hard in wotlk Kappa
[8:57:16] Avaricious_83: Can't you each get a different quest and then share with each other?
[8:57:19] CritcobainTV: LFR is harder than heroic KEKW
[8:57:20] swordart_19: LFR is harder Pog
[8:57:20] abracka_: LFR is harder than normal
[8:57:26] DelcoAF: just farm the farms
[8:57:30] Seathasky: classic andys use that to defend classic tho, i just find it funny
[8:57:31] Eraste: @FerociouzMonk hey, screw firefighter that mess was hard AF
[8:57:33] AtomicHeartSon: LFR is harder than normal because of the players
[8:57:33] PacioliNB: no one really thinks that its just trollin..
[8:57:34] skaya86: @Toasty_SW being banned for selling golds is part of the business
[8:57:37] paulcernik: nah, lfr is a pure joke imo
[8:57:38] goonda1: Jaina lfr
[8:57:41] Killerpoe: @xideontv she was never a night elf :P blood elf you mean but no she is dead
[8:57:43] rhodeos_: if LFR didnt have determination it would take longer than the race to world first
[8:57:50] wafflerboss: lfr sire is harder than most classic bosses tbh
[8:57:56] Eraste: @Killerpoe high elf *

[8:58:00] Toasty_SW: then ur part of the problem
[8:58:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: i remember people in lfr just getting themselves killed at the start just so they could afk it
[8:58:15] justdavesadly: I got gmod from my first lfr run
[8:58:23] Seathasky: nzoth lfr was a shitshow too from what i heard
[8:58:41] Shrenko: whats the point in raiding right now on retail?
[8:58:45] xmedpakx: there is no problem, dont play a game you dont enjoy perhaps?
[8:58:45] Lasidor: No LFR was worse than Durumu in MoP.  THat was RIDICULOUS
[8:58:48] GonoFPS: guys you always do LFR early in  week
[8:58:49] GonoFPS: pro tip
[8:58:55] GonoFPS: LUL
[8:59:09] XshadowturkeyX: ToS lLFR KJ oh god that also sucked
[8:59:19] GonoFPS: 'pro tip' talkin about LFR Kappa
[8:59:21] Toasty_SW: the problem is ur supporting a system that is not helping the game whatsoever    supporting gold sellers etc
[8:59:21] cbiskit89: gear alts that you think might be included next tier? @Shrenko
[8:59:30] Kinghorn: the spider quest is like 10k exp
[8:59:33] probablystonedtwitchuser: nzoth lfr D:
[8:59:42] Denarianx: @GonoFPS or in middle of the night. Because only the true nerds are online in middle of the night
[8:59:43] rusty_gryph0n: Did you bother with desolace?
[8:59:43] sphynx_rayne: I just get really high before doing LFR for the week. Nice calm and funny XD
[9:00:07] JonnyScotland: Lfr queue for sire was 1 hour for me the other day
[9:00:10] Seathasky: is there a point to lfr anymore?
[9:00:12] Lasidor: Durumu LFR would make people quit, I never saw more people suck ass at mechanics more than that one.
[9:00:16] JonnyScotland: Was doing it to try get the pet
[9:00:16] Toasty_SW: its existed yes....
[9:00:19] sphynx_rayne: It's in every game
[9:00:20] Macroversal_: the way people ragequit lfr reminds me of bgs. So much salt.
[9:00:23] Toasty_SW: but its like out of controll.
[9:00:30] SilkeySmooth: thats what wow is boosting every season while blizzard makes bank
[9:00:33] paulcernik: it's all about how much you facilitate that
[9:00:36] kingceejay90: Yeah they must’ve never played RuneScape
[9:00:38] GonoFPS: before you had to 'ask' for it
[9:00:40] sphynx_rayne: If there away for people to pay for peeople will pay for it
[9:00:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: social media is whats out of control
[9:01:04] Twigz_KC: I get FB ads for boosting now that I got back into tbc classic
[9:01:18] JerBoody: There was hella boosting and irl money for gear in Diablo 2
[9:01:19] JonnyScotland: People buying challenge mode boosts and garrosh was just as bad, I know as I used to talk to a gold seller
[9:01:26] Sizbo: dude i got an fking youtube ad for a boosting service on WoW
[9:01:26] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[9:01:30] sphynx_rayne: It is what it is. Some time I buy runs when i want to be lazy if i have the gold
[9:01:32] SilkeySmooth: thats why i dotn take wow seriously anymore
[9:01:41] TwitchBasu: Been playing RS sense 2006 and players do all kinds of boosts there as well, different than wow but you're 100% right @Towelliee
[9:01:44] flandre619: ff11 was more of botting issues. I remember the fishing bot exploit where you fished up broken hats and crafted them back to normal for massive gold creation
[9:01:45] darkhartie: Ruins the game though....

[9:01:57] widdleyscudstv: yo @Towelliee what professions you gonna run on your prot pally for tbc?
[9:02:00] GonoFPS: if you prefer to do content than farming
[9:02:07] ChimmyNeutron: @Toasty_SW It's prominent in both
[9:02:10] Toasty_SW: how do you think pl pay for the runs on classic tho?     ban em all for buying gold
[9:02:18] ImSoBizarre: yep
[9:02:20] JonnyScotland: I just hate the spam

[9:02:34] worksondev: someone buying a Mythic+ achivement doesn't make them a Mythic raider, and takes nothing away from your experience
[9:02:34] TwitchBasu: very true hahaha
[9:02:37] HyirGaming: Boosters and boostees should have no affect on your game experience lol

[9:03:07] NugRun1: also with logs, it is very easy to see who is carries in mythic

[9:03:32] Boksel47: problem is u can't find groups for normal dongoen runs now other then that idc about boosters
[9:03:39] Macroversal_: coxS
[9:03:39] Seathasky: its not logical
[9:03:40] Seathasky: lol
[9:03:44] PacioliNB: The made up people in my head
[9:03:45] GonoFPS: LUL
[9:03:45] theSalute: I have found groups for dungos
[9:03:46] timmietimtom: people just mad they cant do that
[9:03:46] JerBoody: Just like buying a super bowl ring doesn’t make you a super bowl champion.so who cares if someone buys one
[9:03:52] nilachip: destroying the wow econonmy
[9:03:53] swordart_19: @Boksel47 that is classic issue not boosting people issue :P
[9:03:54] alkazam_gg: the people who complain mostly don't even do the end game content anyway
[9:04:06] Templexx: remember when games were fun. lmao

[9:04:22] propwash80: @Towelliee how long would you say it would take to get to 60 in TBC classic?
[9:04:23] Killerpoe: my server on eu classic atleast i havent found a single normal dungeon group in ages
[9:04:24] theSalute: dang he almost 51 :D
[9:04:25] Toasty_SW: i care about my buisness yes    till the problems come to my buisness
[9:04:33] Cloudemon: I like boosting communities filling trade chat so I dont have to see the stupid political nonsense
[9:04:34] Mirkat98: ppl who say all this shit are ppl who dont mythic raid, the fun is in the killing of bosses with people, the gear and everything else is secondary, mythic raiders dont care about gear, its jsut the means to the end goal
[9:04:36] xideontv: are hinterlands trolls amani?
[9:05:03] Toasty_SW: mp mp ots mpt tje bppsters
[9:05:06] PacioliNB: I DO wish it was less advertised slammed in the game.. that might be a legit complaint because its like the whole chat channel
[9:05:09] Toasty_SW: no no its not the boosters
[9:05:10] CrusaderNero: it sucks leveling in classic/Bc and so few dungeon grps going
[9:05:14] sphynx_rayne: yea them guys don't bug me at all
[9:05:17] SilkeySmooth: thats because you buy wow tokens...lol
[9:05:19] Toasty_SW: its the ppl that get boosted is the problem
[9:05:24] Seathasky: @LordPixelTV yea i agree with that, people who dont mythic raid and are casual care about dumb things imo
[9:05:27] GonoFPS: LUL
[9:05:31] Macroversal_: I turned off trade-chat in MoP
[9:05:33] swordart_19: Reason why people do not want me ! everyone is boosted KEKW
[9:05:35] lithium364: it does suck for rated pvp as seen with blizz having to lower the rating for the mount to 1k
[9:05:44] GonoFPS: dude misses an interupt , ah you boosted!
[9:05:44] Toasty_SW: rated pvp is the worst
[9:05:48] HyirGaming: I wouldnt be surprised if people did that
[9:05:50] SirMouSe: I had a much larger issue with it back in the day where goldsellers were trying to scam people out of their accounts so they could sell their gold
[9:06:08] paulcernik: i just got to a point where I'm trying to find ppl to group with and LFG chat is spammed with WTS, easy solution, ignore those ppl, got to the points where my ignore list is full in 1 day
[9:06:21] sphynx_rayne: I don't have the Ilevel in get in to groups... I never thought of people boosted getting in over my me

[9:06:52] fruitvendorx: Boosting is how I make my gold /shrug, why pay for wow if I can carry for my sub lmao
[9:06:54] GonoFPS: if you never had a chinese gold scammer put your 4 toons naked because he sold your gears to a vendor you  have no point in talking about today's gold carries
[9:06:58] SilkeySmooth: you need a bank roll to play a 16 year old game..lol
[9:06:59] xideontv: pvp boost is more than coaching
[9:07:00] C_Diorrr: Its called coachign
[9:07:01] probablystonedtwitchuser: thats for pvp only
[9:07:01] Boksel47: retail boosters don't do any harm , but classic mate, i mean im lvling with quests and some dongeons  at this point u can't find peaple, every one in mara or zg
[9:07:01] Toasty_SW: pvp higher rating requires skill and knowledge..  you get ppl that got boosted and have no clue...
[9:07:04] Samoa92: @Towelliee when you do progression raid do you play meta classes or whatever you enjoy?
[9:07:04] Seathasky: boosting people is the only way i know how to make money these days tbh
[9:07:05] goonda1: paying for a good aprtner
[9:07:05] xideontv: if you didn't learn something, you wasted your gold

[9:07:12] PacioliNB: you couldnt just AFK and get it

[9:08:14] Affiiance: Some people are unable to be boosted to where they want to be rated

[9:09:00] Seathasky: tbf, some boosts end up being carrys
[9:09:10] Seathasky: but ive done a lot of boosts for good players
[9:09:14] paulcernik: "you're carry means someone else's uncarry"
[9:09:17] Oshmri: Can I get boosted gladiator if I'm ready bad?
[9:09:17] SilkeySmooth: your still buting tokens to pay for boosts so your paying to win eitherway

[9:10:39] Berexios123: trickle down effect
[9:10:40] lithium364: i never meet people who didnt buy tokens to pay for an boost honestly, none of my friends farm gold ingame
[9:10:41] JerBoody: @oshmri You can but it’s probably like 5 million gold at least
[9:10:43] sphynx_rayne: but why if you got the gold from blizz why does that matter?
[9:10:55] Toasty_SW: thing is....  someone payed for the token to get the gold you got for boosting them
[9:10:57] ErevVvoid: love the new background. very tbc megusta
[9:11:11] GonoFPS: @Oshmri expensive and will be in RBG
[9:11:17] HyirGaming: Im not sure why people care what other people spend their money on
[9:11:23] Macroversal_: free market bitches
[9:11:24] Richton867: I have most of the store mounts. From tokens I’ve bought on the AH with the gold I’ve made in game.
[9:11:30] sphynx_rayne: But why if someone had the money to buy one. why not buy it to get to where there wanting to go in the game
[9:11:32] paulcernik: @sphynx_rayne doesn't really matter, it's just pay to win in this exactly situation.

[9:12:24] Twigz_KC: @derElten yes
[9:12:25] abracka_: i hope the armory webpage we get for TBCC is just a replica of the original
[9:12:30] BleedoutGamingHD: I don't understand people nowadays caring this much about what people spend their money on. If i wanna spend it on toilet paper and heroin while buying gold ammo in world of tanks and eating a chalupa....im gonna fkn do it. Not that I do any of that but if i wanna i will.

[9:12:51] Macroversal_: people these days have opinions about evvvverything
[9:12:53] SirMouSe: People also buy your shit on AH with tokens they have bought .. its a moot point to say they bought tokens to get boosted
[9:12:56] CrusaderNero: the token is bad for the game overall
[9:12:57] jkitchin75: who care what folks do with there money its there money
[9:13:03] Toasty_SW: my point is that its fully pay to win
[9:13:11] CritcobainTV: it's so fucking far from pay to win
[9:13:19] Wildside1177: Must be a millenial - obsessed with being morally superior.
[9:13:20] Broomba: why is this an issue??? i dont know why people care
[9:13:23] fruitvendorx: It's only p2w if you suck at the game /shrug
[9:13:23] Pietervz: Hou
[9:13:26] Aquadriel: @Towelliee bitches talking as if the gold spent on classic boosts doesnt have any kind of real money involved LMAO
[9:13:29] FerociouzMonk: people are mad because they cant afford tokens or afford stuff in game
[9:13:31] Toasty_SW: you raid to get loot
[9:13:38] Toasty_SW: getting loot is winning
[9:13:41] SonofHorus82: who fucking cares how other people spend their fake, in-game currency?? Why does it matter so much to you?
[9:13:42] mozavich: pay to win is a bigger issue in classic imo
[9:13:49] CritcobainTV: the vast majority of the game doesn't do boosting anyway so i dont see why it matters
[9:13:51] T0MMYT: you play to win the game
[9:13:52] brootalbemo: You don't really win with WoW you just do a little better every time.
[9:13:53] Hybridwarhawk: What's the difference if you are selling raid slots to get gold vs grinding for gold doing dailies, selling, boe's etc?
[9:14:00] BleedoutGamingHD: getting gear dont mean youre winning if you cant clear content
[9:14:00] NugRun1: there are so many ways to verify peoples actual ability
[9:14:01] paulcernik: yah but just because you are not someone exploiting p2w, doesnt make the game p2w (you can still win without paying, but can do it with paying for sure given enough money)
[9:14:09] NugRun1: having a achievment doesn't mean anything anymore
[9:14:10] DorkManTV: pay to skip game content you pay to play
[9:14:14] DrakhanGaming: we will never be slaves!
[9:14:16] JonnyScotland: Before tokens boosts where bought with paypal on skype/teamspeak, I know this as I knew the main people who used to do it in EU
[9:14:17] BJofBorg: Define win in this game. For me winning is getting a rare mount drop as I don't hardcore raid or pvp. Everybody has a different definition of winning. And who cares how people spend their money. As he said, it has literal zero effect on you and your experince.
[9:14:25] Toasty_SW: if you cant clear content   you pay to clear it

[9:15:10] paulcernik: mmorpgs back in 2010 were either full p2w or sub wall, now apperently subscription wall doesnt matter
[9:15:10] Macroversal_: There's no winning in this game. It's a treadmill. You just keep going.

[9:16:16] hammack52: it was a joke
[9:16:16] Acidwalk: !ui
[9:16:17] RageerPLZ: everygame has problems, and a store to buy shit, play WoW people complain of grind/store/bots, play FFXIV you see complaints of bots/grind/store.
[9:16:21] JonnyScotland: The people I don't get are the ones asking for Wow to be f2p ,  That's the day p2w will actually come

[9:16:29] ArbyWan: They just BoP their bank accounts

[9:16:30] claas1211: game*
[9:16:30] Toasty_SW: eso has a store but its ONLY Cosmetic
[9:16:32] paulcernik: but why not go to a "f2p" game (not buying the game/update and no sub) and have the store? while the one you pay the game and monthly is getting a store too
[9:16:32] CritcobainTV: hahah
[9:16:35] d1stract10n: @Towelliee wildstar lol

[9:16:48] Toasty_SW: beeing Only cosmetic is fine
[9:16:51] DelcoAF: I disagree with increasing the monthly fee because the more passive players get a choice
[9:16:51] bigbellyobie: pay for convience is dum it ruins the game cosmetics is fine
[9:16:53] MrGattz: runescape IS a store.

[9:17:33] XshadowturkeyX: eso has stuff that benifits you its called a subscription
[9:17:34] CrusaderNero: then why the fuck do they create alot of leveling content? Cant we just get max level characters?
[9:17:34] Broomba: ESO has store of xp boosts, mounts, cosmetics, etc
[9:17:35] BigMucker: No matter the MMO, I will always be in favour of stores increasing inventory, bank/vault, guild bank/vault storage space
[9:17:36] deathrider606: they have exp scrolls
[9:17:36] Frask81: in ESO you can literally buy rare skill lines lol
[9:17:38] JerBoody: The fact that a WoW subscription is the same price for 17 years and there are fewer subscribers yet they’re making more profits tells you all you need to know
[9:17:40] we_are_whomp: osrs has a game time store
[9:17:41] Chiraakitteh: No eso has crafting boosts, xp, and food/drink

[9:18:02] Morpheusx25: @Toasty_SW good old craft bag
[9:18:02] Samoa92: They could get rid of the store and go sub based
[9:18:04] Toasty_SW: but also they cant buy currency
[9:18:04] DecayedmiNt: @paulcernik They have a store 2 years+ before it can even launch KEKW
[9:18:07] bigbellyobie: its the fact there trying to monetize the players and captilize before the game is even out
[9:18:12] swordart_19: LULW
[9:18:16] Cloudemon: The amount of entertainment you get from a game time wise is insanely good. Imagine getting upset about the transactions you dont even need to participate with.
[9:18:22] Chiraakitteh: And you can buy ability points for alts after you’ve found all of the shards in a zone

[9:18:55] Mitchendo64: why make class tier sets when you can make xmogs you can sell on the store @Towelliee
[9:18:56] IZemekiSI: nobody
[9:18:58] FerociouzMonk: remember the transmog helms they added
[9:19:01] at1c: Who that hell cares if there is MTX
[9:19:03] tyrel_jones: Since the dawn of time, we will always find something to bitch abouy @towelliee

[9:19:08] gwar234: I did like not having transmogs and having raid gear
[9:19:10] Toasty_SW: i remember back when wow didnt need a store cause the content was soo good they had TOns of members
[9:19:10] faulen: Soon we will be able to pay just not play the game anymore.
[9:19:14] bigbellyobie: o so you mean classic wow
[9:19:20] Avaricious_83: Need to level a Tailor to get in on that Netherweave Bag market, forgot about that!

[9:19:32] Olegamst: Store or sub cost, gotta be profitable somehow
[9:19:36] Macroversal_: I remember people complaining about Bear runs in ZA and 'welfare epics' the first time around

[9:19:41] swordart_19: @Kingdom_Knight stop making wow palyers to blame for new world how the fuck
[9:19:46] hammack52: people think that everything that can be put on your character should be obtainable in game, not realizing that if the company doesnt monitize it than it wouldnt be in the game at all, most likely
[9:19:55] DanZep90: you know what's funny, people being mad at store mounts cause "blizz only makes cool mounts for the store" but ignoring all the other HUNDREDS if not thousands of mounts you can get INGAME

[9:20:01] BJofBorg: Newsflash - That was 17 years ago and you can't turn back time. Too many people wearing rose colored glasses. Things change, you change, games change...It's the way it is.
[9:20:12] BigMucker: Most of the people who are getting angry at convenience items are people who never had to use dial up Internet!  Being able to turn on a PC instantly is convenience, having always-on Internet is convenience, enjoy convenience people, it's a good thing.

[10:37:59] Lumimyrsky: Meh, to me it's just annoying that it makes it a bit harder to find people for dungeons because people keep getting boosted. Besides that it doesn't really affect my gameplay
