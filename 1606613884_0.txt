[2:01:19] xenrage1: yoo which judgement u use most swifty?
[2:01:29] zwapy: anyone can give me advice for frost lvling? single target or stick to aoe? at lvl 50 atm

[2:02:28] TheyCallMeUncleBro: that type of talk is used on both horde and alliance. i have played both sides and no matter your faction they always "complain" about their own faction. i guess its just regular gamer talk.... like calling 12 year old kids g@y and talking about r@ping their mothers
[2:02:35] Spart4nm4n: and ganked
[2:02:49] EliBourne: @tonshi1 how did you get 50k for a loss ?
[2:02:57] thesocialotter: but that wasnt what u asked!
[2:02:58] whit3korean: what if you catch me being bad at the game?
[2:03:01] Doomsetus: you use green screen right? :D
[2:03:04] thesocialotter: you asked honor or exp!.
[2:03:10] tonshi1: @elibourne 50k exp for losing AV. it all depends how many towers you get down. only lost 1 out of 8 though
[2:03:15] buckeemaelstrom: what is the addon that is making the ashbringers on the side when he can use an ability ?
[2:03:24] Galdrena: he is not using a greenscreen @Doomsetus
[2:03:29] tonshi1: alliance owns AV
[2:03:37] travek541: @thesocialotter if you are below xp is way better than honor

[2:06:01] Stinketuna: Sounds like Florida Flicker and Flash is good in your area
[2:06:19] soled92: so no major dmg on the house and such?
[2:06:21] EliBourne: that would motivate alliance to take towers for sure
