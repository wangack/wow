[0:32:32] bl1nk_1298: @Guzu it also gives the devs a week to see if any runes or abilities are wayyyyy too strong like hunter explosive shot was
[0:32:32] mordiell: !ads
[0:32:33] StreamElements: Channel is running 3 minutes of ads per hour currently, it is the minimum required to remove the pre-rolls.
[0:32:33] gryphsx: delaying the raid is giga retarded
[0:32:36] TowerOfMourn: delay is dumb. now it means everyone loses the lockout
[0:32:38] Dont_Panic42: @Popcorn921 this is the only rational opinion
[0:32:39] twitchson09: full clear gnomer would take a long time tho
[0:32:39] shogun2255: SoD = discovery not sweat
[0:32:43] 1Emii1: Agree
[0:32:46] Cecross: 1 week is too much tbh. but it's gonna be fun entering the raid with no knowledge

[0:35:24] topmii: Hello guzuHehe guzuHehe guzuHehe guzuHehe
[0:35:37] Blufootgaming: @TowerOfMourn YEP
[0:35:42] draqcula: draqcula gifted a Tier 1 sub to LeeshDK! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[0:35:43] StreamElements: LeeshDK just subscribed PogChamp
[0:35:59] Kurama__95: They always delay every raid tier in retail for a week for that same reason
[0:36:05] Fwonks: if someone clears the raid before you do, all the bosses stay dead forever
[0:36:09] LeeshDK: @draqcula thank uuuu! widepeepoHappy
[0:36:10] SquirtLOL1337: just give me 2hand enhancer rune and i am happy
[0:36:22] Bowski86: looking forward to seeing people book time off work at 35+ years old to sit and no life a 20 year old game. Life goals
[0:36:25] cactusoyeux: Should be delayed for 2 or 3 weeks when you check playtime for an average player. It will takes time to level up to 40 for many
[0:36:28] Blufootgaming: what job om
[0:36:28] Mr_Moffert: J OMEGALUL B
[0:36:29] Beggebin: I dont think delaying the raid is that far off setting an arbitrary level cap. People hated the idea, but it has ended up being a great tool to force people to focus on the world and the leveling process
[0:36:29] draqcula: @LeeshDK  peepoPogo np !
[0:36:31] somadaz: The delay just makes the game better.
[0:36:32] JEM_GG: the race will be more fun to watch tho
[0:36:33] Cecross: yeah farming pre bis is gonna be the same
[0:36:35] pettition: Sweats gonna mald

[0:36:38] sickmode__: guzu please explain me how to warrior 2h in sod ol
[0:36:39] ÂÜÇÂáµ‰πÉÂè£: so people who enjoying lvling need to raid be delayed so they can to enjoy lvling? am i understand correctly? LUL
[0:36:49] JEM_GG: yes
[0:36:50] Mr_Moffert: i get money from the state to play wow all day, thats why i live in scandinavia strongg
[0:36:51] bl1nk_1298: its human nature to see what others are doing that you arent and have a bit of a bad feeling. Also, the "race" isnt interesting when its just "who had the most time on their hands"
[0:36:53] Kleipd: RWF while not having time off work? who the fuck wouldn't take time off ICANT
[0:36:54] Dracconfoo: not delay
[0:36:54] beary134: the race will be worse cause of preraid
[0:36:55] Blufootgaming: NOPERS
[0:36:56] Syloa: delaying it
[0:36:57] SheepADeep: @guzu its a problem if people are gonna expect you to be insanly geared te moment you get to max lvl.  Then a week can help people who dont have that much time playing during a normal week
[0:36:57] beary134: less wipes
[0:36:57] mordiell: i dont think its gonna change anything tbh

[0:37:48] HawaiianTshirt: Taking Feb 8th and 9th off so I can ball out
[0:37:50] saund: i love the delay cause it means you can get 2-3 alts ready first week
[0:37:58] Kleipd: they should not delay, the only people who care about being first, will make sure to focus only on that
[0:38:07] juga27: how are horde going to get to Gnomeregan? waiting for people to get to bfd is long enough at it is haha
[0:38:12] Kleipd: literally not relevant to casual andies fuh
[0:38:15] SpaceCowboy0811: Not gonna be a crazy world first when it's easy content for organized guilds

[0:38:30] mordiell: every expansion or new season we get more rwf, they just lose hype
[0:38:33] mjs010: @juga27 horde have a teleporter into gnomer
[0:38:35] ooTHExTUBEoo: there will be so many people at cap, everyone will want to keep up with the community

[0:38:45] fetza108: this comment
[0:38:53] Hroopek: Not delaying the raid doesn't mean you can't enjoy leveling. Just pick your pace and enjoy the game.
[0:38:58] draqcula: @juga27 I hope alliance cannot camp the teleporter with pets on aggressive monkaS
[0:39:06] TowerOfMourn: except they didn‚Äôt do it phase 1 KEKW

[0:41:19] Syzlak3: i dont want deleay and they should listen to me
[0:41:24] Hroopek: @Hroopek Probably those people want to prepare 5 characters before the raid opens and then just do splits which is more sweaty imo

[0:49:05] Jet_big: The game already looks the same as vanilla 60 balance tho KEKW
[0:49:08] Lorkahn: Guzu should they buff level 60 raid gear?

[0:50:01] jellosalad: its be insane op
[0:50:02] PushnPinkz: Hunter skill cap is just not very low thats why the dmg you see from them is so high.. In good gorups warriors/rogues are the real problem
[0:50:06] Mr_Moffert: PepeLaugh guzu got procced
[0:50:06] draqcula: hunter's are OP but this phase was annoying because of the constant meta slavery
[0:50:07] Ewriick: Fire mages are bad in MC, doesn't mean they are bad overall Shruge Can't use single raids as a benchmark
[0:50:07] Zahnstocherzimtstern: @JuggernautNukes downgraded to a average 22 KEKW
[0:50:10] Lorrot: so what You are saying is that warriors needs a nerf?

[0:50:10] Wyrmban: mimimi
[0:50:10] deathaddict1995: anyway, nerf BM, buff the rest, BM is booooooring
[0:50:10] OddM4nOut: also being too good in PVP didnt help hunters

[0:50:18] Germach: @Guzu Exactly - so i dont know why ppl cry :D on either side :D
[0:50:26] sickish: isn't it pronounced BESTial wrath
[0:50:26] chr47: Yeah hunter legit is a hard class to master (as far as classic wow goes)
[0:50:27] Popcorn921: Hunters main problem was pvp tho. If it was only ove not much would have happend
[0:50:27] Shakezulah22: they will remove most mobs that are bleed immune. you have rogues, ferals and wars with bleeds
[0:50:29] Serpentsting2: Just nerf shit
[0:50:31] Vertigo_GB: Just Nerf warrior to lowest
[0:50:35] Ewriick: @insaniacc_ bish peepoSmash
[0:50:36] buzz97: @Shakezulah22 so if u dont play deep wounds u arent doing bleed dmg
[0:50:37] Serpentsting2: dont buff shit
[0:50:37] mopchild: the stupid issues is that pets dont recieve the same 20% damage debuff from WSG if they just nerfed that barely anyone would complain!

[0:59:43] Weddzz: I think they should add that you can link your profession to other players, with all learned patterns etc :)
[0:59:46] rogueuruguayo: They nerf hunter becuase of pvp, not pve. Come on...
[0:59:48] llamasweater192837: i dont agree with over balancing at lvl 25
[0:59:50] mikeisher87: Isn't the main issue if you buff for pvp - it effects pve too much?
[0:59:51] shogun2255: ye, nerf hunters and buff warriors
[0:59:51] leka42: content too easy anyway
[0:59:57] llamasweater192837: its just gonna make the game complete shit
[0:59:58] Germach: @Guzu the Main thing about Hunter nerfs is, that they are SUPER inconsistent since you can have every week a new meta AND it SUCKS.
[0:59:59] mikeisher87: also the opposite
[1:00:00] icklemedcraf: Over buffing everything is also a rabbit hole
[1:00:01] cereal_675: yeah lets have ultra power creep instead - hmm...

[1:00:09] insaniacc_: Yeah, balancing doesnt work like that sadly. You cant have everything OP, because there will always one a bit stronger and so a meta will form
[1:00:13] jellosalad: we dont
[1:00:13] tsetse2fly: Buff Lone wolf

[1:00:21] Traitmark: catSmash
[1:00:23] aseoun: the problem with the hunter nerfs, was they gave them all these new abilities.  then nerfed them so hard you dont use them.  hunter is the same as it was 15 years ago
[1:00:23] bl1nk_1298: they should stop making balance changes because of PVP. Even on PVP servers, its such a comparatively small part of the game
[1:00:23] peetca: bro dont understand ele need high tier talents same as shadow priest to make it worek
[1:00:24] buzz97: @rizzler90 I'm seeing some top logs with chimera shot and/or aimed shot rn

[1:02:10] doomed_jackass: @Jalapinot Why take away something other people enjoy? Just let them have it. If you don't like it, don't play? Your take isn't good.
[1:02:10] clootz: m+ is always going to be the thing that keeps me on retail
[1:02:10] Curtsy: @mikeisher87 They have specific skill numbers for PvE and PvP, so no reason for it to not like this in sod, other games do it too

[1:03:31] MrCtrlAlt: @aseoun retail microtransaction pets and mounts and stuff makes a crazy amount of money
[1:03:31] Tiamattinen: It's a dagger that had one of the Old Gods' servants in it, and it was used to kill one of the Old Gods so it got a power boost, no?
[1:03:31] Denz0TV: If they bring any retail features to SoD it will be horrible

[1:20:11] Mellion: war of the ancients and the well of eternity
[1:20:11] Arthident: they should start on how the jailor made up his plan
[1:20:12] mordiell: arthas would be the end

[1:21:00] vaultec_: @Guzu GIGACHAD van cleef as main character, stormwind as the villains
[1:21:00] twitchforgotmyaccount: They should do just minor tweaks to integrate Jailer better into the lore

[1:21:04] safari3: We are all waiting to see the Jailor series of course

[1:24:08] Hroopek: Blizzard were always ahead in cinematics creation and had the most badass ones since the early days. The problem nowadays those new cinematics lack "badassness" and it's always "defeating an enemy with power of friendship"

[2:11:28] crematedBrain: iAsk guzu do you have spikes on shield?
[2:11:34] jawiti: @sicknope devastate rune gives dam to sunder
[2:11:36] ye1l: devastate is damage
[2:11:37] victorinox1609: homo priest Aware
[2:11:38] Denz0TV: @sicknope The damage from devastate still applies and it treats homonculi as max sunder stacks
[2:11:39] kaiten9: does not Homunculi prevent stacks of Sender?
[2:11:49] Mr_Moffert: CatGuitar
[2:11:53] typer___iban: consider using Hydra for trash :)
[2:11:54] vathx: yea they wont
[2:11:54] ooTHExTUBEoo: RatJam
[2:11:55] sicknope: ohh didnt know he had devastate rune boys, thanks!
[2:11:56] SanMuki: no they wont
[2:11:58] prodigy_wow: you can still stack them they just wont do anything
[2:11:59] Tras_1337: they stack
[2:12:02] Denz0TV: It treats it as 5 stacks
[2:12:02] twitchforgotmyaccount: Homunculi count as 5 Sunder stacks immediately afaik
[2:12:03] guld1337: you will do 0 dmg with humonculi
[2:12:05] LeBiz: homunculi counts as 5 sunder stacks damage wise
[2:12:05] dlish063: it does the damage of 5  stacks
[2:12:06] vathx: no they wont stack
[2:12:10] nadixlol: it counts as u have 5 stack
[2:12:10] GrandmMaster: @kaiten9 it was just said. Acts as u had max stack of sunder
[2:12:10] ooTHExTUBEoo: RatDance
[2:12:11] jrmartorino: @kaiten9 It is stronger than 5 stacks of sunder
[2:12:13] buzz97: the hummonculi debuff will make it so devastate acts as if there was 5 stacks
[2:12:14] typer___iban: homuncli will insta apply, and runes scale to lv25, homunculi IS better
[2:12:16] Highmen3: But homunculi counts as 5
[2:12:18] LeBiz: yes
[2:12:23] ye1l: yes
[2:12:24] GoochiiFX: homonculus + fairie fire is enough to get bosses to 0
[2:12:28] vathx: homunculi debuff falls off, sunder is better
[2:12:30] Kinghorn: we have told you 10 times yes it counts
[2:12:31] Highmen3: so its 5x6
[2:12:32] GrandpaReno: music is banging
[2:12:32] ye1l: homunculi it acts as if u have 5 stacks
[2:12:36] Highmen3: With homunculi
[2:12:38] Denz0TV: Yes homunculi will insta apply the equivalent of 5 sunder stacks
[2:12:43] ye1l: so u dont have to do 5 sunders with less damage
[2:12:45] SanMuki: so does it count tho?
[2:12:48] aVis29: which runes?
[2:12:49] ye1l: u max pump from start
[2:12:50] Hylaren: kinda
[2:12:53] Serpentsting2: "
[2:12:54] buzz97: IT WORKS
[2:12:55] ye1l: it does
[2:12:55] Kinghorn: yes
[2:12:56] LeBiz: Yup it will work with the rune damage
[2:12:58] Kinghorn: yes yes yes yes yes
[2:12:58] Denz0TV: Yep it works and does full damage
[2:12:59] Highmen3: Hey Guzu, it applies the 6% times 5 with homunculi
[2:13:03] Reiumi_: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:13:04] Blockaaattv: no you cannot apply  sunder if htey have their homunculi up
[2:13:05] vathx: 5 sunders is better, homoculi debuff falls off if the priest isnt on top of it
[2:13:05] crematedBrain: @Kinghorn but chat is also known to say sh*t without any prior knowledge omE

[2:57:55] grylz89: Top parses are all cheese strats

[4:53:11] StreamElements: Guzu splits his audio, so the music doesn't show up in VODs cause of DMCA. Youtube still goes through desktop audio though and shows up in VODs. Here's how to do it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD9sWOjITYU&ab_channel=nutty
