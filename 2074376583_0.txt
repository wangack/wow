[0:14:41] cantfindthebox: I eat and drink all the time as rogue
[0:14:42] Bourbons86: not even possible last I checked
[0:15:25] Bourbons86: didn't think about mage specific stuff didn't realize, but regular water I don't remember working
[0:15:44] cantfindthebox: has to be made in arena. mage food, lock health orbs etc

[0:18:20] Radmoon: oh nice
[0:18:31] Magottx: Ven I have fricken fractured knee cap! And torn cartillage floatin around. No wonder it’s been bugging me lol
[0:18:53] Symo85: @Magottx ouch! sorry dude
[0:19:36] Magottx: Na I’m Gucci I can get the cartillage removed and then just deal with the fracture pain so I’ll be good
[0:19:56] Magottx: In 20 years may be another question but whatevs
[0:20:04] lnlprime: Buenos Dias amigos!
[0:20:34] drfeltgood: @venruki do u have the XLR mini?
[0:20:40] Magottx: Nothing hurts as bad as playing vs DH lobbies all day
[0:20:59] dailyshuffle: @Magottx true
[0:22:20] vanlonja: @venruki No balancing for another week?
[0:22:23] FunnyName26: Yo Ven, just had a killer leg day. You make sure to have a killer stream!
[0:22:42] seaent: nothing til season 4
[0:22:44] Radmoon: ven what part of canada where you ?
[0:22:48] seaent: if were lucky
[0:22:49] Peachxp_: monday being today or in 1 week?
[0:22:56] eainzsp: i think the mdi or something is happening i dont think changes will come bc of that right?
[0:22:58] StromicusRex: dw guys they're probably gonna put some more sod balance changes out soon :)
[0:23:11] van_hendrix: flames or oilers @venruki
[0:23:20] Radmoon: alberta maybe i should move there :D
[0:23:24] van_hendrix: that answers that then
[0:23:25] FunnyName26: Don't changes typically come out between Tuesday-Thursday?
[0:23:26] Peachxp_: im pretty sick of seeing dh 90% of my arenas shuffles 2s or 3s KEKW
[0:23:28] Mhortai: I think changes come after AWC
[0:23:30] heymomimonttv: between mdi and awc again this weekend, no changes coming
[0:23:31] Mhortai: at this point
[0:23:39] nightmxz: @StromicusRex can't wait for fyrakk to get tuned Kreygasm
[0:23:51] Radmoon: better then iran dude almost getting killed here :D
[0:23:53] bluefintunatv: say whaddup to Justin T for me 😉
[0:24:13] Skillcap: wait what? DH nerfs coming? Pog
[0:24:15] FunnyName26: The mass lay offs may have something to do with the lack of changes dont you think? @venruki
[0:24:17] bluefintunatv: appreciate you 😂
[0:24:19] Peachxp_: on a lvl 60 pala atm i kinda miss slands lol kyrian auto stunning here LUL
[0:24:19] vanlonja: Why should they balance when the game is perfectly balanced already Kappa
[0:24:47] Skillcap: Thanos agrees KEKW
[0:24:50] hooqs: maybe they balance retail the same time they turn wotlk arenas back on
[0:25:07] bluefintunatv: blizzard had mass layoffs?
[0:25:12] FunnyName26: Hmmm good point. Maybe
[0:25:12] soddi: you expected frequent updates on your 13€/month live service game? hah xdd
[0:25:21] SteLawBro: Games balance seems fine to me. Ive been a DH main for 3 months now and the games never felt better. Think people need to practice more.
[0:25:21] Mhortai: @soddi not devs though
[0:25:24] Peachxp_: cant they just keept he ptr on the current patch so they can keep practing and the whole game doesnt have to suffer
[0:25:35] heymomimonttv: @SteLawBro i lol'd
[0:25:37] waitimdesyncd: Layoffs were in the support compartment mostly. You cannot open a ticket right now, and if you do it can get shut down with no response. Ive had a ticket for 2 months about some titles that have gone missing and they havent responded yet
[0:25:46] piffzorz: Games balance seems fine to me. Ive been a DH main for 3 months now and the games never felt better. Think people need to practice more.

[0:26:18] miridafeo: Morning all
[0:26:21] Bwrecker: Bwrecker subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! ya man np, thanks for all the content
[0:26:29] Synckery: as Tank
[0:26:31] RoovenEU: RoovenEU subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! yooo what's good
[0:26:31] dickman911: tanks
[0:26:36] five_moke: game seems fine… skill issue
[0:26:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: vengeance DH is the only tank I've seen in MDI
[0:26:48] Synckery: MDI are playing tank and 4 dps a lot of the time
[0:26:52] vanlonja: Making PvP suffer so they can better promote PvP trough AWC seems mental but ok.
[0:26:57] Radmoon: why do i feel like every year the pvp getting fucked
[0:26:58] triqshot14: owned
[0:27:00] Bwrecker: LOL
[0:27:00] hooqs: that war is pissexdc
[0:27:02] Radmoon: like nobody playing anymore
[0:27:03] Polyrhythmz: They all stack caster dps
[0:27:20] bic4884: poor soul
[0:28:13] Mhortai: @vanlonja Has nothing to do with promotion. Just has to do with not wanting to have players practice one thing and possible change things.
[0:28:30] WhereMaldo: thoughts on another week of no retail tuning and a month straight of sod class tuning? I’m kinda pissed :/
[0:28:45] Mhortai: Just easier to not have to deal with backlash from possbile bad changes during the esports events.
[0:29:05] piffzorz: mhortai got a solid head on those shoulders
[0:29:33] five_moke: ppl acting like blizz hasn’t made changes before comps before when they literally dropped the ret wave before a tournament
[0:29:50] Mhortai: @piffzorz I am also lucky to get a little insight into things because of people I know lol.
[0:30:15] Peachxp_: DH DESTRO Pog EVERY TEAM
[0:30:19] leeka: isnt the pve mdi next week though? So changes might be another week away
[0:30:24] Mhortai: @five_moke Ya this. Though maybe they learned from that, but overall the heal of the live game should trump esports UNLESS esports gets OMEGA big.
[0:30:35] Synckery: they might announce changes on friday FOR the following reset fingers crossed
[0:30:48] pugulus_prime: I will gladly jump on whatever is the next broken spec bandwagon
[0:30:55] Mhortai: @Synckery Ya this is the hope lol
[0:30:56] Peachxp_: DH only class that legit solo's me through pre using walls/BM KEKW
[0:30:59] EliteDamit: is it a proccy-p kind of day

[0:31:19] WhereMaldo: just seems like they’re killing the game by splitting the player base so hard between sod, classic, hardcore and retail.
[0:31:32] soddi: I don't think SOD pulls resources away from retail ... they just finish work on the next xpac. End of season is always slow (except legion, that was not normal)
[0:31:33] wisescience: is mana relevant in retail?
[0:31:39] five_moke: really just seems like we’re constantly having the same convo about pvp season after season patch after patch pvp not a priority to say the least
[0:31:39] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[0:31:45] Synckery: Proccy P on fire
[0:31:59] vanlonja: Next week patch notes: "All Illidans banished back to Outland" KEKW
[0:32:00] bic4884: @wisescience in soloq not really
[0:32:19] locked29: this patch
[0:32:21] Synckery: weve had more changes in DF that BFA and SL combined tbh
[0:32:25] Kadyan: something is amiss... did he SHAVE? 🤔
[0:32:27] RasmusAdrian22: @xaryuisweak stop swearing
[0:32:27] nightmxz: tbh I think the game was actually really good in the patch before they buffed rdruids in s2, I was really enjoying the game before the trees took over
[0:32:28] wisescience: @bic4884 gotcha, thx. haven’t seen oom happen much but I’m also not a normal retail watcher
[0:32:29] SweatyDaniels: every time i get into a lobby and see a DH i just instantly pee in my pants
[0:32:30] drfeltgood: @venruki your mic LOL....
[0:32:34] SweatyDaniels: i just accept it
[0:32:35] Peachxp_: Rets/ Aug then DH is kinda only 3 specs to ruin pvp this xpac right?
[0:32:44] drfeltgood: Super nice
[0:32:45] locked29: I think they layoffs really hurt the pvp scene for retail
[0:32:55] drfeltgood: yeah
[0:33:18] bic4884: @wisescience can only happen in 2s and 3s soloq has too high dampening for the most part
[0:33:35] five_moke: Games balance seems fine to me. Ive been a DH main for 3 months now and the games never felt better. Think people need to practice more.
[0:33:58] locked29: nothing wrong with there being 3 dhs in a lobby
[0:34:12] drfeltgood: @locked29 I'm hoping that MS will back fill the vacated spot with in house people.
[0:34:23] zeref_qq: KEKW
[0:34:32] zeref_qq: WORLD FIRST DH DEATH LIVE ON ARENA
[0:34:41] EliteDamit: ascendance proc CLUTCH
[0:34:46] EliteDamit: come on proccy p
[0:34:56] wisescience: lol now mana is relevant
[0:34:57] kusoneko: demon hunter still didnt die ICANT
[0:35:00] Merkflare: DH not good
[0:35:18] five_moke: he’s playing tank 😂
[0:35:20] EliteDamit: think the dps defensive usage just wasn’t great
[0:35:22] lundbergmackan: I swear rsham is to fucking tilting to play in solo shuffle
[0:35:25] Merkflare: should train the dh
[0:35:32] Synckery: the funny bit about DHS being so insane is that you often find one who is like 500 mmr skill level lower than the lobby he is in
[0:35:42] Synckery: so even tho theyre insane theyre trash and some how throw
[0:35:43] Synckery: LUL
[0:35:51] zerx_gg: hiii
[0:37:00] nikweberr: when retail new xpac?
[0:37:16] Merkflare: SEE
[0:37:24] zerx_gg: dh dead??????? buff pls
[0:37:32] five_moke: wow, dh needs buff. dying way to easy
[0:37:56] Synckery: ok maybe its a bit of an exaggeration Kappa
[0:37:59] Synckery: but you get the point
[0:38:30] kusoneko: shit upon that priest
[0:40:34] Menelolgains: Wat da hHell
[0:40:36] vanlonja: Pets in PvP are just tillting
[0:40:48] lev4o0: Ven, I would like to ask you why are there so many canadians who move to Russia recently? My youtube feed is full of canadians who decided to abandon their country and move to Russia. (thats not a mainstream knowledge ofc)
[0:41:09] nikweberr: fear doesnt do damage, duh
[0:41:10] MaximumnNeo: troll
[0:41:16] dickman911: earthen is really only part that is specifically frustrating for shm healer imo.  everything else is just usual heal frustrations that you get on any healer
[0:41:22] magnusz: just missed my shuff q
[0:41:25] magnusz: u reckon i try again 2moro
[0:41:27] MaximumnNeo: there was that 1 family on the news
[0:41:30] MaximumnNeo: and they desperately want to come back
[0:41:45] five_moke: because Russian women beautiful
[0:41:45] drfeltgood: @venruki I have that info on moving to Russia that u asked about....
[0:41:47] shugguls: @magnusz lol full day quing to get 1 game
[0:41:48] bm00re: They were promised they would be given a farm, then went there and had their passports and assets siezed.
[0:41:52] lev4o0: its like farmers and such people
[0:41:56] bm00re: Now they want Canadian government to get them back
[0:41:59] Synckery: Venruski Kappa
[0:42:03] magnusz: i mean yea i gotta try again tomorrow
[0:42:07] possibly_dave: they thought canada was too oppressive so they thought russia was a netter idea lol
[0:42:09] magnusz: after u miss a 2hr q bc u went to the bathroom
[0:42:13] magnusz: ur just smoked off shuff for the day
[0:42:48] magnusz: only thing i want to play now is in traffic
[0:42:50] magnusz: in game
[0:42:53] leeka: @magnusz they watch you, soon as you leave the room, the q pops
[0:42:56] five_moke: moving to Russia is about as smart as the soldier running across the boarder to North Korea 😂
[0:43:02] magnusz: it was on my dh
[0:43:04] fugginhiding: let's start the morning with some evil fistweaving maybe
[0:43:11] magnusz: u think i can get high enough mmr on a warrior to sit a 2hr q?
[0:43:13] magnusz: HAHAHAHAHA
[0:43:15] magnusz: good 1 bro
[0:43:20] Squantanimo: would love to see you crush some ele
[0:43:31] srslol: ven play fw arcane mage with me
[0:43:32] WhereMaldo: not me waiting for ven to get a pop to q my shuff. don’t need to be embarrassed on stream xD
[0:43:32] magnusz: yea
[0:43:38] stealthwalker99: retribuki to give mag a que pop
[0:43:44] kusoneko: whens the BM hunter coming out
[0:43:51] magnusz: i know bro i know im just making it work
[0:43:52] chronicfuels: why do ppl only complain about fistweaver when dragons can pull 150k dps as healer
[0:44:07] hamsti: because dragons damage doesn't heal
[0:44:10] hamsti: lmfao
[0:44:14] magnusz: ive been rly feeling like i improved in the last month on dh
[0:44:14] Magottx: Hi @magnusz  :)
[0:44:17] van_hendrix: dragon also doesnt do 40k dps WHILE healing
[0:44:21] magnusz: alhamdulilah
[0:44:34] magnusz: dont type to me bro ur a terrible person @Magottx thank u
[0:44:34] FrankFrank: should i get a certain lvl of pvp gear to start arenas with a new char? or just start and get gear from grinding arenas?

[0:44:43] Magottx: Haha how so big guy?
[0:44:45] chronicfuels: ty sir
[0:44:53] kusoneko: do i essence break before blade dance or after
[0:44:57] magnusz: complete stain of a person

[0:45:43] magnusz: i remember u vividly
[0:45:53] magnusz: u are the definition of garbage
[0:45:57] Magottx: Yea you banned me in smex steam for no reason 3 years after the fact
[0:46:19] magnusz: begging like a starving mutt for my attention any time u see me
[0:46:25] Magottx: When literally all I said was you look like a marshmallow flexing in the mirror lol
[0:46:31] kusoneko: drama Pog
[0:46:36] Mhortai: lol
[0:46:38] Magottx: You’re so mad still I’m sorry I hurt your ego so bad m8
[0:46:39] SweatyDaniels: KEKVibe

[0:47:08] SweatyDaniels: all i know is anyone who eats their oatmeal with raspberries is a psycho.. blueberry oatmeal all the way
[0:47:08] magnusz: imagine never knowing what its like to be successful in any aspect of ur life so u sit on the internet trying to judge/belittle others
[0:47:12] magnusz: brutality
[0:47:13] Dizzlx: this priest loves you
[0:47:14] zeref_qq: i came with the coffee but im ready for the tea :P
[0:47:17] shugguls: thats the type of lobbies i get on my war
[0:47:19] Magottx: Oh you don’t know who I am lol

[0:47:23] magnusz: hope u find happiness 1 day
[0:47:24] xNotMat: Same brother
[0:47:26] magnusz: keep grinding bro
[0:47:26] StromicusRex: there's no privacy anymore

[0:47:28] Jashling: I get political ads every hour its doomed
[0:47:31] Mhortai: @venruki I have changed my phone number because of that a few times lol
[0:47:32] MaximumnNeo: after getting dozens
[0:47:42] Peachxp_: like venruki spam or like loan irl shit?

[1:07:15] TrippThree: Nobody wants to heal solo bec when you get a 4-2 lobby, you might not get rating.

[1:09:35] srslol: all g
[1:09:46] pr1me1989: ven, what is the best comp for DH in 3s?
[1:10:08] xikaari: are we hoping for changes today or hoping for next week
[1:10:10] Arian331: do I still have to unlock Voidelfs first to make a VOidelf char
[1:10:14] rexxarhero4: @venruki cool, i just wondered because they dont have any form of anti heal like some others
[1:10:15] Arian331: cause I’ve never done that
[1:10:15] zachgamegodx: i got to 2200 as frost mage, but now i find healers are dispelling my frost bomb and it dont feel so good
[1:10:25] yippey_: Afternoon Ven
[1:10:31] zachgamegodx: this has been by far the hardest spec to play for me

[1:11:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Get the duck polymorph, it's pimp
[1:11:49] marvin1995xo: cause fistweaver are cancer

[1:12:10] EliteDamit: people also get very mad at me on Pres tbh. they don’t like that I have to do more than ‘just heal’ to win lol
[1:12:16] marvin1995xo: not fun to be a caster against 3 meles
[1:12:16] bitcoinonlyfans: Fistweaver makes healing fun again
[1:12:20] bjjamm: isn't the main thing for a fistweaver to just kinda stay close to him?
[1:12:23] Nateypww: how many pve fistweavers do you think there are???
[1:12:29] bjjamm: like if you stay far away you're not getting any healing?
[1:12:33] nightmxz: fw = melee range
[1:12:39] bitcoinonlyfans: you contribute way more to games
[1:12:45] nightmxz: Doesn't matter what you're playing, just play melee with a fw :)
[1:12:54] bitcoinonlyfans: @bjjamm 40 yard range
[1:13:19] bitcoinonlyfans: double DH& FW is god comp right now
[1:14:00] brakealot: @venruki you have some good music playing as always, and might I say you look like the hottest uncle in the wow scene
[1:14:17] brakealot: xdd
[1:14:25] cruelhabbitts: on a mage it is very fun
[1:14:37] Nateypww: this is a perfect 6-0 arcane lobby
[1:14:50] bjjamm: how would you play this on a frost mage? if I don't get focused I can play this pretty well, but once they start focusing me I kinda panic and don't know how to properly burst someone down
[1:15:00] bjjamm: which leads to me just running aorund like a chicken and not doing anything but die pretty much
[1:16:52] van_hendrix: @venruki one thing i started doing this season since they changed the backlash damage to % max hp instead of based off the damge you dealth is death other priest fears so i can save fade for stuff like hoj or what have you. just a preference thing but death always breaks priest fear now because of that change
[1:16:57] Salanzo: avg solo shuffle que wait time: 45mins
[1:16:59] Salanzo: =[
[1:17:31] van_hendrix: death another target but yeah then you just use fade xD

[1:18:56] EliteDamit: I think people really don’t realise how much more pressure is on a healer than a dps. we make a small mistake and it can cost the game instantly

[1:36:45] dawnovun: Lol
[1:36:45] Zrinn13: @dawnovun if thats the case than bushy25 would get banned
[1:36:51] Cariffo: he was just too good :(
[1:37:04] mudcx: best pally in game
[1:37:04] oredsson1: I think someone said it was Twitch ban bcs of view botting somehow and Wow ban bcs he was toxic ingame and got reported to many times I guess
[1:37:14] five_moke: yes. because the way the report system works is that if 5 ppl report you, you get insta banned. so when his followers seem him report they jump on the bandwagon
[1:37:24] tomjb91: Big dam judge was too powerfull
[1:37:41] arzak: mass reports = instant ban
[1:38:09] Laziltv: No that isnt always the case  or else streamers would be getting banned far to often
[1:38:10] satirically1: i think its 11+ now cuz people were auto removing people in rated bgs for a lil bit
[1:38:11] ekologiisk: we get to see 8 more hero talents tomorrow?
[1:38:16] dawnovun: Idk how many it is but it's been proven to work that way. A streamer had people report him to test it and it got him banned and he had to put in a ticket.
[1:38:23] dawnovun: It was Staysafe who tested it.
[1:38:30] five_moke: it was 5 but yeah maybe it’s more now
[1:38:34] Yimbus737: wtf
[1:38:37] anmusallam: DAMN IT VEN TAHT WAS ME THE DK
[1:38:37] heymomimonttv: i dont think it's 5 cuz i've had a whole solo lobby report an afk person between 2 rounds and they didnt get instabanned

[1:39:19] heymomimonttv: destro seems pretty similar to frost mage tbh
[1:39:26] mudcx: ven the type of guy to say demo lock is fun to fight

[1:44:53] mudcx: warrior is so bad
[1:45:08] Zrinn13: just play fistweaver instead
[1:45:28] Salanzo: i think he deterred and cancelled it in the same global
[1:45:31] brakealot: shadowmeld also worked like feign death kinda
[1:45:35] 2prac: So Legion strike does more dmg then felstorm @Salanzo in st
[1:45:35] brakealot: so it dropped combat in pvp
[1:45:42] mudcx: its always the answer ven
[1:45:43] bigpumperrz: arms is oke, fury could use a bit buff
[1:45:51] heymomimonttv: warrior is good its just not S tier like it used to be
[1:45:55] heymomimonttv: fury is rough tho
[1:45:57] zachgamegodx: there's a dk in top 10 in eu
[1:46:11] heymomimonttv: dk is good too, its just not god tier anymore
[1:46:14] mudcx: i have 1 comp
[1:46:18] mudcx: again
[1:46:19] tomjb91: Isnt there a blood dk at like 2500 i eu?
[1:46:27] tomjb91: Caled bloodzin or something
[1:46:29] mudcx: ret war fist zzz
[1:46:40] mudcx: give me kitty cleave
[1:46:42] heymomimonttv: arms warrior can play ret, it can play turbo, it can play thunder
[1:46:44] mudcx: tsg
[1:46:53] heymomimonttv: if you want kitty cleave then ask for feral to be buffed lol
[1:46:57] bigpumperrz: i see arms also play with sp
[1:46:59] zachgamegodx: dh warrior isnt a comp apparently
[1:47:10] mudcx: what dh wants to q with warrior
[1:47:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Turbo was usually fun to watch
[1:47:13] mudcx: bruh
[1:47:42] zachgamegodx: idk one thats friends with a warrior ? its a good commp
[1:47:45] heymomimonttv: i;ve been playing enh with ret pally and rdruid and it's been semi viable at 1800 mmr
[1:48:07] eainzsp: bm hunters are so dumb
[1:48:30] heymomimonttv: bm hunter is annoying cuz they can turtle and still do almost full dmg with all their pets out
[1:48:39] DegStaerian: yooo
[1:48:43] Peachxp_: fought a BM dev at 2350mmr last night guys just perma piss dmg the whole game didnt feel like they had " cooldowns"
[1:48:43] DegStaerian: when is AWC?
[1:49:05] DegStaerian: Pog
[1:49:11] heymomimonttv: dh warr is good, dh is good with almost everything rn. people just must not wanna play with mud i guess
[1:49:13] Hammer90x: after the armor nerfs, i'd be surprised if anyone takes a warrior over WW or Outlaw, they're just better versions of warrior xD
[1:49:17] mudcx: is dh war a good ladder comp idek ive never seen it
[1:49:27] vanncleff: Hi, where are you from?
[1:49:30] cyborg1141: What do you like to run with hpal the most?
[1:49:55] heymomimonttv: @Hammer90x warr is less squishy than ww so there's that at least
[1:50:13] zachgamegodx: theres 10 warriors in top 110 ppl on EU and only 4 rets
[1:50:35] tomjb91: Mop KFC was the fynnest shit ever on warrior. mega dam
[1:50:41] tomjb91: Funnest*
[1:51:14] Cerion17: hey ven, hey chat !
[1:52:06] zachgamegodx: @mudcx on EU there's just as many arms warriors in t100 as outlaw
[1:52:20] zachgamegodx: i think arms should get a nerf and fury sohuld get a buff
[1:52:34] mudcx: LOL
[1:52:37] heymomimonttv: i dont think arms should be nerfed but fury does need some love

[1:53:08] zachgamegodx: ye im trolling abit but the fact is their represented all over

[1:54:17] mvpala_tv: ven i played fury in ss yesterday and it felt kinda insane, if you live til 2nd spear it feels like instawin
[1:54:18] pisspuke: and you play some holy or disc please and thank you?
[1:54:19] zen_oni_shinobi: oh my gawsh
[1:54:21] mudcx: bye ven have a good stream buff warrior nerf dh
[1:54:25] MaximumnNeo: i literally looked at my laptop for work for 30 seconds and missed my Que

[1:54:48] McLarge: Buff Frost DK
[1:54:48] cyborg1141: Feral maybe some love
[1:54:54] wowsuomi: I liked the new avatar show
[1:54:55] vertmac: enhance
[1:54:58] Laziltv: can we get DK buffs???
[1:55:01] heymomimonttv: feral and enh could both use some love
[1:55:02] cyborg1141: Feel bad for the feral on the other team
[1:55:07] theodeth: agreed, buff rogues
[1:55:07] Hammer90x: @heymomimonttv True, but I think WW has a much better kit for surviving if played right. I think all arms really needs right now is a revert to that armour nerf or a fix on d stance
[1:55:09] loveandsupply: sub rogue needs a dps buff
[1:55:20] heymomimonttv: @Hammer90x i  can agree there
[1:55:27] migliqt: dont smile from this outlaw rogue
[1:55:34] migliqt: went 0-6 in my last shuff
[1:55:36] zachgamegodx: you see enhance shamans at an abnormal rate on that mage of yours
[1:55:48] loveandsupply: make sub rogue vanish 30 sec on refreshing cooldowns
[1:55:51] McLarge: Buff Augmentation, I need another partner to play with on my DH pepeLaugh
[1:55:53] cyborg1141: Maybe better set bonus big diff
[1:55:55] migliqt: he has 3.5k rounds
[1:56:02] heymomimonttv: @Hammer90x i think fist of fury is kinda broken for melee classes, cuz they have it up almost all the time
[1:56:15] ferahgok: yea I see Lopez all the time. dude's a gamer
[1:56:16] Salanzo: WTF how did yours pop but not mine sadge
[1:57:27] StromicusRex: streamer privs

[1:59:25] EliteDamit: this enhancement is pumpingbro
[1:59:35] Magottx: Let him dial
[1:59:42] McLarge: You get to play RMPala and RMS at least. Too bad it's into Turbo LUL
[1:59:53] heymomimonttv: @tomjb91 i think it's just trolling crusader saying "one shot judge" lol
[1:59:58] zerx_gg: xddwicked

[2:04:10] zerx_gg: rbgs xdd
[2:04:10] americanmoses18: cuz rbgs are outdated and boring @brakealot
[2:04:12] brakealot: I mean, nobody playes it is my guess
[2:04:23] americanmoses18: talk about the least looked at bracket
[2:04:49] brakealot: alright, I just used it 2 seasons to get my 1800 gear, then like 1-3 times a week I did a few of the bgs and just dominated silly
[2:04:53] McLarge: I'm noticing Ven call himself bad a lot today
[2:05:08] brakealot: boomie + the reset buff that nobody gets and the SL convoke was silly

[2:10:13] ion82: It was close
[2:11:01] McLarge: I think you're supposed to go 2-4 in this lobby with RMPala and RMS, but you won a round with the Enhance. So you can probably 3-3 this, maybe 4-2 if you manage to beat the Outlaw again
[2:13:57] ferahgok: man, shaman are so annoying to play against as a caster
[2:15:18] WardenDOTA: #unfixgrounding

[2:18:01] McLarge: Outlaw is supposed to 6-0 that,  but you managed to beat him with the Enhance one round. Hard earned win
[2:18:36] FateIRL: did you see the #1 outlaw in shuffle? its a random guy who never been glad
[2:19:08] williwhite94: SS is not 3s or normal arena so it makes sense
[2:19:16] rynosaurwow: @FateIRL Seems like a bot account. It's new
[2:19:21] Hark0n: MrDestructoid random guy
[2:19:31] ferahgok: @FateIRL Yea there's a lot of good gamers out there that just never take/took 3s seriously
[2:19:54] Primetimexxxx: @ferahgok I completely agree
[2:20:05] jporter_: is there any reason to try and get legend besides just the achievement?

[2:23:59] zulu_ww: hope liquid does but it’s either move/liquid
[2:24:04] WardenDOTA: 6-0 lobby for NA
[2:24:15] R1_Prototype: I think eu looses.
[2:24:21] SirBeaverTeeth: OMEGALUL
[2:24:22] infernion: Imo there's no way dh destro can lose to comps like boomkin rogue/sp rogue tho, but I feel like NA will just farm for some reason
[2:24:29] trikkSP: korean shaman stronger
[2:24:30] kusoneko: we all know you mean foxy when you say na shamans
[2:24:37] WardenDOTA: EU players havent played any comp other than rmp for the last 20 years you think they can adapt to a new meta? LMAO

[2:30:14] Magottx: rukiParty
[2:30:26] account4turbonoadz: his wow ban was 20 days which is surprising he hasn’t racked up longer bans
[2:30:26] miridafeo: No just 19 days now
[2:30:30] WardenDOTA: the mies was targeted by haters
[2:30:34] account4turbonoadz: maybe 2nd acc idk
[2:30:51] miridafeo: He's got to have more than 2 accounts
[2:31:43] Proffzx: if there was ever someone who deserved to be IP banned it’s him for sure lol
[2:32:18] wtfs_a_twitch: @Proffzx really? I mean hes toxic for sure but at least he isnt a cheater
[2:32:18] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[2:32:58] oredsson1: Yeah idk either, he dont deserved to be perma or IP banned bcs he likes to talk shiete
[2:33:03] Proffzx: guy threw his 3 rounds with me in solos because I icewalled him off and beat him round 1. guys lost his mind
[2:33:07] oredsson1: There is absolut worse cheaters and hackers out there
[2:34:40] Juliio29: I don’t think anyone should be banned for talking shit unless it’s telling others to off themselves
[2:35:15] Juliio29: this generation is already soft as it is we need crusaders to toughen some of y’all up lol
[2:35:26] wtfs_a_twitch: i certainly dont mind people catching a ban for toxicity, its just far from wow's biggest issue right now
[2:36:07] wtfs_a_twitch: toxicity is a big reason wow has very little new players
[2:36:14] zerx_gg: i feel like going gnome on my main mage
[2:36:22] Magottx: rukiHmm

[2:47:11] mrtx404: @venruki  Why is Holy Priest often played at the moment ?

[2:59:08] Dyazah: @venruki What weakaura do you have that highlights shaman totems?
[2:59:20] zachgamegodx: i feel like supas playing paladin cause h thinks itll be beest on paper but youd do infinitely better with himon druid/sham bc thats what he has most experience with
[2:59:24] zachgamegodx: just my 3 pennies
[3:00:21] Cocoapuffs1: no
[3:00:29] Salanzo: time for double DH

[3:01:05] justjoshingyo: Yup that happened to me with darkness macro
[3:01:08] zachgamegodx: did u use myslot?
[3:01:10] Ambersulfr: I heard about it on twitter, apparently if you had a certain setting to 0 you weren't server storing your macros.
[3:01:17] zachgamegodx: u might have used it for kazekage
[3:01:18] Ambersulfr: and everything forced overwrite to the server copy
[3:01:39] Dyazah: @venruki What weakaura do you have that highlights shaman totems?
[3:02:01] R1_Prototype: the macros section is weird. I find every once in a while I’ll change one and it will revert mid-combat
[3:02:04] Cocoapuffs1: holy prism is so bad with it not giving holy power anymore
[3:02:16] Cocoapuffs1: play lay on hands talent

[3:08:29] zachgamegodx: ven why are none of your mages void elf, you're so good with that racial
[3:08:37] Vigi9413: is meld that OP?

[3:12:22] Goblin_Seaman: which enchant illusion is that?
[3:12:36] Ambersulfr: it feels extremely isoalting
[3:12:46] Ambersulfr: I've started doing keys again to hang out with friends
[3:12:57] hogx: i think shuffle is very isloating...i'd rather play 2s / 3s and talk to my team
[3:13:20] Slayer_Eagleone: they probably will remove solo shuffle is what im hearing
[3:13:27] Ambersulfr: from where?
[3:13:29] Slayer_Eagleone: and 2s i hope
[3:13:38] Ambersulfr: sounds like something you made up tbh
[3:13:47] Slayer_Eagleone: they are going to be focusing on solo rated bgs
[3:13:54] ferahgok: @Slayer_Eagleone Lol 2s and Shuffle is all I play. THere's goes at least my sub if they do that
[3:14:27] Cocoapuffs1: they arent gonna remove shuffle lol
[3:15:05] Slayer_Eagleone: @ferahgok why not play regular 3s?
[3:15:09] Bourbons86: @ferahgok lol exact same here. I will do bg blitz though too once rated
[3:15:45] ferahgok: Despite its shortcomings shuffle was a large success and has thte largest participation
[3:16:12] grimmjowhd: someone actually thinks theyre just going to delete shuffle? xD
[3:16:27] nokster: @Slayer_Eagleone and where did you hear that ? KEKW
[3:16:29] ferahgok: @Slayer_Eagleone I don't feel like taking the time to network and try to coordinate times to play and push. I'd rather just log and que. maybe with a friend if they're on for 2s
[3:17:17] swolecolemole: they need to bring back big ascendance, windfury, doomwinds version of sham this new elemental and nature dmg thing is not fun
[3:17:19] Fury73: Fury73 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Who's ready for AWC Guantlet?!
[3:17:34] ferahgok: @Bourbons86 Yea I like BGs to just log on and blast for fun too. Probs won't worry about rating when rated blitz comes out personally. But I know some people will love it
[3:17:41] SweatyDaniels: Class Changes: Fistweaver Monk has been changed to Pissweaver. All spells and abilities will have the word Mist replaced with Piss.
[3:17:56] Cocoapuffs1: is he using his flash of light procs? its pretty big saving mana if he uses them a lot
[3:18:01] Cocoapuffs1: doesnt seem like he is
[3:18:09] shad3dspectr3: KEKW
[3:18:15] irmaodofox2: Its possible to play with only Honor/conquest gear?
[3:18:37] mordekhuul: @Cocoapuffs1 I thought infusion of light procs were best used on judgements to reduce dmg incoming?
[3:19:19] Cocoapuffs1: not bad to judge ig but if your goal is to save mana its definitely better to use on flash
[3:19:27] waelrick: LUL
[3:19:28] shad3dspectr3: LMFAO
[3:19:31] Cocoapuffs1: and trying to use up all your procs really important

[3:33:22] ferahgok: And conversely, if you aren't spamming clone, you die
[3:33:42] Aroty: Make them hard cast it again
[3:33:48] Cocoapuffs1: clone shouldnt benefit from haste as much on boomy
[3:33:54] nightmxz: allow predatory swiftness to cast cyclone again and also make it so they get +40% vers when they cyclone, leave in the feral frenzy too Kappa KappaHD Keepo MiniK
[3:33:55] Goblin_Seaman: I do miss when armor type made you squishy or tanky
[3:34:13] Aroty: Supa is biased AF
[3:34:28] Thenickradice: Ya, in feral's current state. You might as well rove the class if it lost clone feral frenzy without any buffs to compensate. Big buffs
[3:34:34] Thenickradice: Remove*

[3:35:56] Kikrino: HA rogue got fucked xD
[3:36:41] Nonversations: i always thought u were talking to yourself this whole time
[3:37:10] nightmxz: I wonder if they added cyclone back to predatory swiftness but removed all the bonuses from cycloning it would be better? Idk if it would even be op cuz it would still die
[3:37:18] Hark0n: casting CC like a caster is the reason i hate feral
[3:37:20] driftwood_tc: I miss the days when feral was mainly about pressure, dot and run.
[3:37:24] eainzsp: with a dh meta where they can just run you down and live forever you just are useless
[3:37:31] Goblin_Seaman: feral needs an overhaul at this point, bleeds just don't work in the current meta
[3:37:31] Hark0n: its mandatory too since you need FF to actually do damage

[4:38:22] Nickystr1x: who members dh manaburn meta
[4:38:29] xRinzzyx: Ven try to judge more when you have infusion procs and it will restore your mana, helps in the long damp games

[4:38:42] FunnyName26: Also I thought Canadians used Kilograms not pounds though

[4:39:01] buffnac: @camrencyber let’s you sheep dps free if it gets dispelled
[4:39:03] xRinzzyx: it restores some mana, and it absorbs damage from the person you judge (like 100k)
[4:40:12] Blitzylive: wait how pally die?
[4:40:19] Cocoapuffs1: its not that big
[4:40:22] tomjb91: Yes

[4:40:33] xRinzzyx: its a talent
[4:40:52] xRinzzyx: its better to flash in short games, but games that go to dampener, you need to judge more to keep your mana up
[4:41:08] pisspuke: ayooo
[4:41:12] zerx_gg: HUHH
[4:41:17] Blitzylive: wait is the shaman sterge or Vince?

[4:45:16] Kujo_XX: That MoP pathing code
[4:45:16] stonedmonkey: so your saying buff mage? agreed
[4:45:22] obviouslytai: im sure the coding is weird for that
[4:45:25] jondoe2239: probably because the scripting/pathing for monks was done more recently than warriors
[4:45:25] FateIRL: it works on mugambala between the stairs you zip up
[4:45:30] vanlonja: @venruki Is it just me or is the paladin the only healer that drops dead by default on almost every swap on him? LUL
[4:46:03] peeachy8: Further proof Blix hates warriors
[4:46:07] soddi: maybe someone "improved" the performance of pathfinding algo for that spell, and nobody wants to fix it

[4:46:53] Exitlifez: yeah not like a priest where u can easy recover at 30%
[4:46:55] obviouslytai: i get what ur sayin dawg i hate pally
[4:47:04] jondoe2239: imo dam reduction abilities arent as effective as they should be
[4:47:08] jondoe2239: aka damage is way too high
[4:47:12] kusoneko: they should make armor reduce magic damage too
[4:47:17] obviouslytai: u just said u had nothing which i disagree with but yes ur squish
[4:47:23] addiiez: Yes

[4:59:31] wackpoetic: Dude you know what sucks about instagram. You click on the Crumbl cookies of the week Post ONE TIME, and now everytime I refresh my FYP I see sometimes MULTIPLE POSTS of the fucking cookies. How's a man supposed to diet?
[4:59:32] xRinzzyx: Paly is unfortunately one of those healers that you really have to play around procs

[5:00:04] ShaggyMcShag: what are the meta comps in 3v3? i havent played since SL
[5:00:07] xRinzzyx: its counterproductive to your biggest throughput and tier which is centered around daybreak though
[5:00:09] heymomimonttv: @wackpoetic fr. crumbl cookies are ass tier anyways
[5:00:09] TheNutcracka: i feel even as rdruid i just cant go for drinks like in past expensions
[5:00:29] ginnjo_: The best advice for this is always: "Have you tried healing less?"

[5:02:11] heymomimonttv: @wackpoetic mycookiedealer ruined any type of 'fancy' cookie for me as they're the absolute best bang for your buck. i really love tollhouse cookies from the grocery store tho and baking them myself lmao
[5:02:22] ginnjo_: Damn that was nasty start. Almost ended it there.
[5:03:28] SweatyDaniels: jelly filling jelly filling
[5:03:47] wackpoetic: heymomimonttv pretty sure I've seen the ads for mycookiedealer too lmao I'm fucked. are they that good?

[5:15:27] figurines: 75% of people stop eating meat for juicy booty. not the health benefits
[5:15:31] daymann456: dude u glazed me like a krispy kreme earlier
[5:15:47] Jmacklol: im 7 years still sticking with it
[5:20:45] FelQueen: Actually there is a simple solution, we need to change the type of damage dealt by DH and make at least 50% of the damage dealt physical rather than magical, then there will be balance in the game and finally the Holy Paladin will survive TakeNRG
[5:20:55] absterge: how long are your games

[5:21:36] satirically1: it wouldnt be game changing but 3 star chest/leg enchants is like another 13k mana
[5:21:39] repsac1442: not when they know you have to.
[5:21:45] absterge: how long was that game
[5:21:58] Cocoapuffs1: try plea maybe in long games it gives almost a whole mana bar
[5:22:03] repsac1442: like 3 or 5 minutes
[5:22:41] absterge: are you flashing a lot
[5:22:46] ATHLTE: they just swap u on plea
[5:22:48] SteLawBro: Crusader wins every game at full mana
[5:22:55] absterge: try reclamation
[5:22:57] absterge: instead of barrier
[5:22:57] repsac1442: no he’s not spamming it
[5:22:59] absterge: that'll help

[5:23:16] ATHLTE: ah
[5:23:18] repsac1442: Carl is a god
[5:23:19] Cocoapuffs1: its decent mana still
[5:23:20] xRinzzyx: yeah its better than barrier
[5:23:25] ATHLTE: barrier feels horrible ngl lol
[5:23:38] xRinzzyx: its also passive mana management so you don't have to worry about it
[5:23:42] absterge: pally is basically... with the right comp u have infinite mana... spoilers: ur not playing the right comp LMFAO
[5:23:43] repsac1442: means you have to get Crusader strike
[5:23:57] ATHLTE: seems like infinite mana with splay lol LUL
[5:24:04] xRinzzyx: and with the wrong comp you have a negative mana bar xD
[5:24:13] absterge: basically double wizard or like destro/hpal + immortal dps
[5:24:23] absterge: ye @ATHLTE
[5:24:23] figurines: you really should play casters w/ hpal sadly

[5:27:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: whoa demon hunter puns
[5:27:38] shroomkinz: how do you feel ab being trained by a dh all game lol
[5:27:46] dryangore: doesn't disc do ok healing turbo?
[5:27:51] nightmxz: healing is fine until the game lasts 8mins and nothing dies :)
[5:27:56] Cocoapuffs1: plea is worth at least in some match ups. it gives so much mana and the healing decrease isnt that bad earlier on in game
[5:27:56] iLLwiLL_HS: chat do you have the one shot ele build
[5:27:57] McLarge: Replace Supasenshi with a DH and I bet you'll have more fun
[5:28:33] Juliio29: hpals get nuked by magic damage for some reason
[5:28:43] mufaasa_fr: Dh and fistweaver are a Plague for the game
[5:28:56] shroomkinz: I can relate
[5:29:02] shroomkinz: it’s awful xD
[5:29:11] Kleenextv: u get safeguarded too lol
[5:29:28] uncannysword: 100%, sham is unkillable and we learned it from AWC
[5:29:29] shroomkinz: really? I’m struggling against dh as rsham
[5:29:33] FlyFYI: yeah but look how much damage hes taking AppaK AppaK BagOfMemes
[5:29:40] shroomkinz: but I’m new to the class so maybe I’m not that good
[5:29:45] zHaKy7: Sham doesn't have bubble though
[5:29:54] smitesucks: against 1 dh sure but against dh+ret  just wall isnt enough on rshaman lol
[5:29:58] foxyllama: i think shamans die shamans just have better instant cast healing
[5:29:58] uncannysword: sham has a wall of CDs, it's crazy
[5:30:00] zHaKy7: Although wall is almost like a bubble on sham
[5:30:03] repsac1442: burrow
[5:30:07] repsac1442: almost the same thing
[5:30:08] strafekey: nah I play a bunch of healers and Hpala feels tough into melee cleaves and DHs
[5:30:09] foxyllama: they just heal through it better
[5:30:09] satirically1: i feel like hpala has too many defensives/utility so they all feel lack luster
[5:30:10] shortsandpants: I feel like were here with you sitting in your room watching your monitor
[5:30:32] galdinator: shaman just drops static field and sends them back to valdrakken Kappa
[5:30:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: freaking totems
[5:30:38] repsac1442: I don’t think pally by any means is bad
[5:30:40] cadillacseville: does ven play outlaw
[5:30:44] repsac1442: just in my opinion
[5:30:49] shroomkinz: hm gotta brush up on my rsham play against dh then lol I feel perma dead being trained all game
[5:31:30] uncannysword: @shroomkinz you can self peel them off
[5:31:50] zHaKy7: Honestly rsham is the easier healer to peel dh off
[5:31:55] shroomkinz: yeah I use basically all my cc and try to rotate it on them
[5:31:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP
[5:31:59] Jerbadino: @venruki whats that addon you have that shows the season buff and what it does like (DPS or CDR)?
[5:32:19] zHaKy7: Roots static knock and stun
[5:32:21] repsac1442: can’t leave on that gamw
[5:32:21] Myth_The_Wolf: Yo, any tips on who to learn Arcane Mage from?
[5:32:23] repsac1442: game
[5:32:35] shroomkinz: I’ve only been playing it a few days though so I know Im not playing optimally
[5:32:35] xRinzzyx: Ven, I was looking at your spec and I would also recommend picking up imbued infusions under the holy tree. It reduces shock CD by 2 seconds for every infusion proc you consume. It really helps w/ mana management because you can guarenteed shock again after using the infusion procs
[5:32:46] shroomkinz: just hard lol
[5:32:50] Myth_The_Wolf: Down to 3 classes left before I get all to 1800
[5:32:55] repsac1442: they don’t want jelly cursing the ladder

[5:36:09] raeza444: unlucky run it back
[5:36:12] xRinzzyx: definitely, you're playing really well. Sorry if I was overstepping, was just trying to think of suggestions for extending mana
[5:36:36] raeza444: healing is stressful lol
[5:36:40] raeza444: esp this patch

[5:58:56] wfwefwefwefwefwef: remember when ven got Marked for death removed from the game :)
[5:59:12] zachgamegodx: i like being a mage into this more than a lock, i feel like bm hasnt been as bad to face as i thought with all the cdr i get from time manipulation on RoF knock and nova since my frozen orb is coming up every 20-30s
[5:59:21] drfeltgood: @wfwefwefwefwefwef I remeber when he got Ret nerfed in to trash
[5:59:22] zachgamegodx: and ret and warrior are my easiestprey
[5:59:33] wfwefwefwefwefwef: lol
[5:59:59] TCVisMMN: everyone should play double DH in 3s until it gets nerfd
[6:00:09] wfwefwefwefwefwef: @TCVisMMN 100
[6:00:20] zachgamegodx: @TCVisMMN they are tho
[6:00:30] galdinator: yea its already happening LUL
[6:01:27] tomzartheravenlord: Warlocks seem to get a lot of hate from every melee comp
[6:02:53] drdoomkinx: bonds of fel hits 150k
[6:03:00] tomzartheravenlord: Fel Fissure is anti-heal, 25%
[6:03:03] drfeltgood: Bonds is nice agasint mel;ee
[6:03:06] tangell0s: bonds of fel feels super underwhelming
[6:03:13] zachgamegodx: so does incinerate and shadowburn
[6:03:14] zachgamegodx: KEKW
[6:03:39] tangell0s: feel like i'd rather soul rip, short port, etc into melee
[6:04:42] Shredmuffn: bonds of fel is a small snare vs melee or nether ward vs casters
[6:04:42] Moobot: Latest video "I Tried The Most Toxic Spec In PvP..." view it here: youtu.be/YSS9gvaAz9U
[6:05:31] zachgamegodx: thats fel fissure
[6:05:43] galdinator: nobody gonna comment on that insane round
[6:05:45] drfeltgood: Wonder if Sub will be back for season 4?
[6:05:53] strafekey: lol yeah that’s not bonds of fel
[6:05:54] tomzartheravenlord: Havoc bolt with fel fissure, pure excitement
[6:06:04] drfeltgood: damage isn't real good
[6:06:19] Devcomz: Its a Firm belief across the LFG community that Sub is bad and Assa is really bad
[6:06:19] Myth_The_Wolf: Ruki is locked in rn
[6:06:56] crymorre: unless they specifically buff sub rogue damage i doubt it will magically become good when people have even more hp next season
[6:07:15] zachgamegodx: if you want to do maxdmg on rogue, play assaa. if you wanna enable someone else to do with lock down onentire team on dr 120k dps, play sub. if you want a little of both, go outlaw
[6:07:20] zachgamegodx: there's no bad rogue spec
[6:07:24] drfeltgood: @crymorre Im hoping for a specific buff
[6:07:56] DegStaerian: The seducer
[6:07:59] Devcomz: @zachgamegodx Tell that to LFG
[6:08:01] zachgamegodx: you're not supposed to solo people as sub, you're basically an aug evoker, youre enabling someone else to do big dam

[6:08:05] maqmax12: arcane is more fun
[6:08:13] tomzartheravenlord: You can suc on my bus :P
[6:08:21] zachgamegodx: whenever sub can 100-0 ppl on every dance, the game is bad
[6:08:34] calaim: wtb arcane games so i can study how to do damage X_X
[6:08:55] Devcomz: If you want to LFG games without resistance I would go outlaw though
[6:08:59] cadillacseville: shark buff bte with subterfuge dance and vanish is super fun
[6:09:07] drfeltgood: @zachgamegodx see that's the issue ... I need to solo people in SS other wise my stuns get broken and I go 2-4
[6:09:24] nikthevoker: i hate everyone, how does SP get 2 stun/silences off in 4min game LUL
[6:09:26] shogun2022: whats a shark buff
[6:09:55] cadillacseville: 100% crit on between the eyes if you gear right
[6:10:00] drfeltgood: @shogun2022 its a roll the bones buff outlaw gets
[6:10:05] zachgamegodx: @drfeltgood sir, how the heck are ur stuns broken
[6:10:16] zachgamegodx: if you want lock down and dmg, play outlaw
[6:10:23] shogun2022: ahh roll the bones buff makes sense thanks
[6:10:31] drfeltgood: @zachgamegodx because the other dps spams the stun trget or aoe's
[6:10:52] zachgamegodx: so bc it doesn't always work in solo shuflfe it deserves a buff doctor?
[6:11:00] arcane_p: I swear ever since I started playing melee classes it’s so hard to play casters again I hate just getting trained and interrupted all game
[6:11:07] drfeltgood: @zachgamegodx yes, sorry I thought I was clear about that
[6:11:08] Devcomz: Also Rogue dont play Sub if they dont do damage it seems. Rogue players and even the Rogue streamers besides Nahj are saying Sub is bad now. Sub should probably get a redesign so its liked by everyone instead of not played
[6:11:12] Devcomz: or super op
[6:11:25] Devcomz: then played
[6:11:27] crymorre: @Devcomz correct take
[6:11:36] crymorre: sub design is putrid
[6:11:39] shogun2022: that reminded me of michael scott's chris rock impression
[6:11:44] zachgamegodx: @drfeltgood i think you probably just don't know your role well as a sub rogue if you think they need a buff, Whaazz is # 1 on ladder in EU on his Sub rogue
[6:11:51] drfeltgood: @shogun2022 noooope
[6:12:14] rvdsupremas: Playing dps allot. Tried some healing today. I got desimated. Wtffd 0-6  1-5  difrent healers. Dont have it anymofe. I made for dmg
[6:12:27] drfeltgood: @zachgamegodx if we are going to start holding HOF rogues as the litmus test everyone is fucked tbh.
[6:12:29] zachgamegodx: @Devcomz frankly, it's still super op
[6:12:35] ihymisery: whaaz is outlaw lil bro @zachgamegodx
[6:12:51] zachgamegodx: @ihymisery no, the rogue he's highest on is sub
[6:12:53] zachgamegodx: "lil bro"
[6:12:55] zachgamegodx: rofl
[6:13:04] drfeltgood: Chief
[6:13:08] shogun2022: scout
[6:13:11] Myth_The_Wolf: Fellas, do you know anyone who makes Arcane Mage guides for 10.2?
[6:13:14] drfeltgood: Pal
[6:13:14] ihymisery: pip squek
[6:13:16] ferahgok: Champ
[6:13:19] shogun2022: bud
[6:13:20] Devcomz: Not to the eyes of everyone else @zachgamegodx It was dropped like a hot potatoe by most. I haven't seen sub in my queues in shuffle 2s or 3s in a long time since the stam change and evis nerf
[6:13:32] drfeltgood: @Myth_The_Wolf aegis has a new arcane guide on youtube rn
[6:13:32] rvdsupremas: F awc! Why noooo class tuning!?¿
[6:13:50] subbyye: Buff sub !
[6:13:51] rvdsupremas: Feelsadman
[6:13:52] Myth_The_Wolf: @drfeltgood Thank you, I'm learning Mage next and I wanted to watch someone play it
[6:14:04] maqmax12: yeah arcane are gods
[6:14:15] calaim: ARCANE PLZ
[6:14:23] rvdsupremas: Play dh again haha
[6:14:25] wowsuomi: Same
[6:14:26] CatnipEvergreen: play ret :D
[6:14:29] Kymagez: cook
[6:14:31] Devcomz: Outlaw replaced sub for the vast majority of Rogues now all I see
[6:14:32] rvdsupremas: Dh solo and 2s
[6:14:34] Myth_The_Wolf: @venruki if I gift a sub will you play Arcane so I can watch?
[6:14:36] guccikikuchi: play aug
[6:14:37] subbyye: Some devoker would be sick
[6:14:46] drfeltgood: @Myth_The_Wolf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXTQZKogdp4
[6:14:50] zachgamegodx: LET THEM COOK
[6:14:52] CatnipEvergreen: Why do you have your water on low settings btw?  Just curious
[6:15:01] Myth_The_Wolf: @drfeltgood Thanks, I'd just pulled it up ♥
[6:15:03] gelatokush: same i log stare at the game for a few min, check friend list, lfg, proceed to log out :D
[6:15:11] drfeltgood: @Myth_The_Wolf np
[6:15:16] zachgamegodx: isnt it 5 subs
[6:15:20] wowsuomi: What u plan to cook
[6:15:25] Myth_The_Wolf: Myth_The_Wolf is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to venruki's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[6:15:25] Myth_The_Wolf: Myth_The_Wolf gifted a Tier 1 sub to sparserfer! 
[6:15:41] nightmxz: Is it time to bring back the wheel?
[6:15:59] Myth_The_Wolf: Thanks!
[6:16:04] Kymagez: @nightmxz only if he puts feral on it
[6:16:08] drfeltgood: @zachgamegodx Listen Chief , don't police the gifted sub request's.
[6:16:32] nightmxz: @Kymagez You really love his suffering don't you? KEKW
[6:16:37] maqmax12: and gr6 music
[6:16:38] Kymagez: :)
[6:16:40] ogbuckwheats: do you have a nice apron you can wear during the cooking strim? v important
[6:16:45] drfeltgood: @xaryuisweak Xar?
[6:16:47] Devcomz: Its a mindset really though if Rogues dont see they are doing damage that spec is dismissed always happens by the majority. It is something I observed for years
[6:17:01] Badasti: frying pan... a kitchen...
[6:17:15] shogun2022: noooo I just waited 30 mins in queue, looked down at my phone for 10 s and missed queue
[6:17:17] wackpoetic: DH :)
[6:17:37] dismantlle: arcane?
[6:17:47] shogun2022: solo shuffle queue times are insasne
[6:17:50] shogun2022: insane
[6:17:52] zachgamegodx: the wheel is so important when the changes are slow to come in
[6:17:52] Kymagez: @nightmxz triggered ven is best content ven, you get sooooo many sound effects BLELELE
[6:18:01] zachgamegodx: to keep the vibes as fresh as they can be
[6:18:26] wowsuomi: Need to buy game pass for them to save
[6:18:33] wackpoetic: The most enjoyable part of DH is that you could replace their talent tree with a game of Peggle and they would still do top dam
[6:18:39] Nemenon: WideBoris
[6:18:59] repsac1442: I love that my slot addon
[6:19:03] repsac1442: works like a charm
[6:19:20] ogbuckwheats: when it good its really good
[6:19:29] repsac1442: really?? I’ve never had an issue with it
[6:19:30] nightmxz: @Kymagez You want the rukiTrig  scream huh?
[6:19:32] Devcomz: Also @zachgamegodx I was not saying you were exactly wrong. I was just giving you my observations of what I seen from Check pvp and Drustvar data and Rogue players specific though on it. Whaaz is a different breed of Rogue though. The term "CC Bot" is now used for Sub I seen
[6:19:36] repsac1442: maybe cause I have less characters
[6:19:38] Tiebot87: @venruki please stop me before I regret it... hows WW monks in pvp atm ?
[6:19:53] repsac1442: they’re very good tie
[6:20:04] repsac1442: but everything has a counter
[6:20:10] zachgamegodx: @Devcomz all good man, dont worry about it at all
[6:20:37] Kymagez: @nightmxz i clicked in yesterday and he was spinning around in the back making crazy man sounds, i fkin died
[6:20:42] repsac1442: I do
[6:20:44] Myth_The_Wolf: Hell yea
[6:20:53] repsac1442: I told you I wanted to play mage you suggested frost
[6:20:59] repsac1442: but I wanna play arcane lol
[6:21:19] repsac1442: my arcane is full geared but I suck
[6:21:23] shogun2022: I dont play mage at all is arcane considered the most difficult to master?
[6:21:51] Kymagez: ven told me to play dh and now i get bullied
[6:21:51] repsac1442: I’m not blaming you all I’m saying is I wanna learn arcane bro.
[6:22:24] zachgamegodx: it did seem like you were blaming him
[6:22:48] cantfindthebox: frost dk is hard to play
[6:22:57] Badasti: this music is not it

[6:23:56] Myth_The_Wolf: Wow, there's so much going on, it's crazy
[6:24:10] repsac1442: just was trying to say arcane seems so cool when you’re good at it
[6:24:18] rainmannxz: @repsac1442 nah bro don't think you said it wrong, Ven is just neurotic like that a bit, its all good
[6:24:57] rainmannxz: a lot of people are projecting onto him daily and he's used to protecting himself LUL
[6:25:16] Myth_The_Wolf: Observer living with 1 HP is so tragic
[6:25:27] repsac1442: fair enough, haha I was just basically trying to say I’m excited to learn arcane from watching haha.
[6:25:54] rainmannxz: uuf that's a big task, good luck with that <3
[6:26:05] repsac1442: thanks man!
[6:26:08] Fixit_cat: 2 Fast 2 Fear-ious
[6:26:35] wackpoetic: Observer needs to be 1-shottable again
[6:26:36] Gleds: Observer is painful 🥺
[6:27:40] higanheim: absolutely miserable
[6:27:45] wackpoetic: just getting observed
[6:27:52] rembrandt89: warlocks are fun ! ResidentSleeper DansGame
[6:27:57] rvdsupremas: Jesus  fear fear fear
[6:28:00] pr0x365: Yo ven! how you doing today
[6:28:22] pr0x365: Doing well man! glad I caught your stream!
[6:28:22] Gleds: Observer CD is too short, and if its going to be that short, it should have less health
[6:28:25] maqmax12: just get fist monk:P
[6:28:26] wackpoetic: how it feels to fight a Warlock as a caster: 👁🔥💀
[6:28:40] Tiebot87: @venruki WW monks state in pvp? have u played venfuki? I wanna make a return, WW main
[6:28:41] raven1103: Ven do u know how to play ret ?
[6:28:55] setbackttv: i was playing 3s with him the other day. He's an amazing healer/shotcaller
[6:29:01] okayfood: Which mage spec is best for first time mage? @venruki
[6:29:03] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: make him chanage spec than
[6:29:04] Myth_The_Wolf: Does your priest friend stream?
[6:29:08] wackpoetic: but if it's a bad comp, doesn't that mean Bigvuqoffdam wants to play it even more?
[6:30:42] wowsuomi: Maybe his said its so bad noone can make it work
[6:31:01] rvdsupremas: Jesus shamans are so toxic
[6:31:29] rainmannxz: nah feral resto shaman is insane
[6:31:32] rainmannxz: nahhhhhhhh
[6:31:33] j_rd95: such an obnoxious 2s comp
[6:32:16] repsac1442: I think 2s is the worst bracket
[6:32:17] rvdsupremas: Big disadvance playing a caster in 2s.
[6:32:27] Myth_The_Wolf: Is RSham a hard counter to Arcane?
[6:32:29] repsac1442: people play dps healer just go play 3s
[6:32:39] repsac1442: I would say so.
[6:32:58] wowsuomi: But wanted test it with the best
[6:33:29] rainmannxz: into clone into static into laso into shear into clone into static into shear
[6:33:41] higanheim: frostbolt goes straight to grounding and kills it you'd think arcane blast would

[6:34:52] rainmannxz: You're not sounding like a baby at all why would you want to suffer
[6:34:59] tomzartheravenlord: Or have double DH with DH healing
[6:35:01] Myth_The_Wolf: No need for be Arcane or even mage, I feel like I learned a lot from that
[6:35:02] wackpoetic: Play Aug Fistweaver Madge
[6:35:07] xvpsp: bro your boomy starfall was fun no ?

[6:39:35] repsac1442: lol
[6:39:38] Gleds: Eles fun
[6:39:45] Myth_The_Wolf: Sorry Ven! I just got HPal to 1800 so I'm trying to learn Arcane now, is all
[6:39:55] Myth_The_Wolf: Do you reckon I should invest in Frost stonks if I'm doing 2s?
[6:40:04] boomkin_exploit: sad i missed it, did u yell "big damn" and then do less than 2% of their HP every 10 seconds?
[6:40:06] Peachxp_: 2s pog
[6:40:15] Peachxp_: surely first dh all day ? KEKW
[6:40:34] gelatokush: the highlight of my day was your smile. Venruki smile brightens my day... <insert copy pasta>...
[6:40:51] Myth_The_Wolf: Okay, I've never played Frost nor Fire before (Never mained Mage so I only ever played Arcane)
[6:40:59] famous1939: fire is my favorite rn
[6:41:17] Myth_The_Wolf: Might learn Frost for 2s if you think that'd be better
[6:41:27] Badasti: i prefer frost, i just wish it was better in this meta... I log on my destruction lock and do a shit ton more dam
[6:41:52] Myth_The_Wolf: I just wanna get 1800 rating and pick up the armor on my mage
[6:41:53] Fixit_cat: Lol
[6:42:06] gelatokush: i like frost played it abit yesturday im not very good but i enjoy it
[6:42:27] tomzartheravenlord: Nothing unusual, typical dh
[6:42:37] juicymeld: will they ever nerf dh. class is absurd
[6:42:50] gelatokush: i have 41% vers on my mage now its abit better
[6:42:55] tomzartheravenlord: @juicymeld Probably when Ion gets bored of it
[6:43:01] DanielNA51: that priest healed 6.9M and you you did 3,9 dmg
[6:43:06] raceyg: Is it just me or does this season feel longer
[6:43:08] Myth_The_Wolf: Okay, I'll try to learn Frost instead of Arcane, then
[6:43:14] Peachxp_: imagine the next pvp patch ntoes actually skip over DH, as if any other issue is remotely close KEKW
[6:43:15] justjoshingyo: @juicymeld people seem to forget it was nerfted FOUR 4x already ...lol
[6:43:29] Gleds: @juicymeld it's there to accommodate... problem is when people with half a brain play it.
[6:43:29] marvin1995xo: im now going to play the worse healer a hpal
[6:43:48] Myth_The_Wolf: Ah, I had asked for Arcane because it's the only Mage spec I'm familiar with
[6:44:02] juicymeld: @justjoshingyo we need a 5th
[6:44:09] ImJordanHi: Hey Ven do you have any other Ninja products? What can I buy along side my Creami
[6:44:09] repsac1442: @gleds that’s my problem
[6:44:11] Myth_The_Wolf: My only knowledge of Frost is "dispel frost bomb" and "interrupt or line Glacial Spike"
[6:44:21] raven1103: Do u ever divine storm on ret ?
[6:44:29] repsac1442: no
[6:44:38] gelatokush: no
[6:44:47] rembrandt89: killing with ray is always fun
[6:45:01] Deathandtaxes07: arcane mage badda bang bang!
[6:45:07] vazootwitch: @justjoshingyo 4 times nerfd and still like this? then they did a shitty job nerfing it
[6:45:23] gelatokush: ray is the best mage ability to be added in a while imo
[6:45:31] gelatokush: so satisfying to press
[6:45:36] DanielNA51: wreck the druid?
[6:45:42] xvpsp: What you gonna eat :O ?!
