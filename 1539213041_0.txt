[1:23:30] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: thats mage
[1:23:32] swampt1l: Gold
[1:23:33] OviTheGray: purple'ish are too close to lock and dh
[1:23:34] Thoreya: Think the dark green is fine LUL
[1:23:34] Gezber: mage light blue tho
[1:23:35] ItsGlime: sham/mage blue
[1:23:36] Anxxius: just black yea
[1:23:36] swampt1l: Platinum

[1:23:50] OviTheGray: black or silver
[1:23:51] masterlee05: rat grey LUL
[1:23:52] Daxter1988: Orange
[1:23:53] stahlpakt54: there is no red one or?
[1:23:54] Chiraakitteh: Time to start using textures lol
[1:23:57] Aidler: Teal already taken?
[1:23:59] rohdey: another Purple is prob what would be next
[1:24:00] stahlpakt54: orange is kinda for druid
[1:24:20] Rudric_Ice: could have just added gold as a color
[1:24:24] swampt1l: That looks like grey to me @saphirosa_dragonaspect
[1:24:26] Murderingz: grey is the dc color
[1:24:29] skrin001: orange
[1:24:29] wigglenobber: magenta
[1:24:32] Deadlegacy1337: gold
[1:24:35] Daxter1988: GOld
[1:24:36] jhajden: brown
[1:24:36] dutchie76: Rob why you leaking Wrath Classic Kappa
[1:24:40] wigglenobber: periwinkle
[1:24:42] UltraContent: still waiting for that 5¬∞ weight  +100kg+ option, evoker too skinyy
[1:24:44] zulkhanis: I think beige could work or another variation of white
[1:24:44] dutchie76: LUL
[1:25:01] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @zeuussss_ nearly the same shit. Couldn't tell it apart except for the offline text
[1:25:01] masterlee05: metal grey is kinda cool
[1:25:09] Anxxius: black
[1:25:17] Rudric_Ice: gold would have been perfect
[1:25:23] dutchie76: man this looks exactly like BFA dungeon
[1:25:29] Aidler: metallic colors‚Ä¶. hmmm
[1:25:43] swampt1l: That‚Äôs true,guess we really are running out of colors @saphirosa_dragonaspect
[1:25:45] wigglenobber: just start using different digital camos lol
[1:25:50] JarzzTv: looks like rfc
[1:25:55] mrbambusxd: man, shaman tree looks fucking amazing, i wish priest was like that, i love priest, but as it looks right now, it's just so bad. Disc lost silence and then shaman gained lightning lasso and gust of wind etc, priest has 0 utility. my god it looks bad. shaman tho, damn looks nice
[1:26:06] nvnto: @dutchie76 Uhm, which dungeon are you thinking of?
[1:26:33] dutchie76: @dutchie76 legion one too in highmountains, and temple?
[1:26:46] masterlee05: if i preorder dragonflight is there a chance to get into beta?
[1:26:52] mrvic0: this alpha?
[1:27:05] Rudric_Ice: @masterlee05  no
[1:27:05] scumlucki: woaahh cool mammoth
[1:27:06] swampt1l: No this is shadowlands
[1:27:07] delaine: I hope there's a magmatusk mount
[1:27:07] nvnto: no, but you need to have an active sub to be considered as far as i know
[1:27:11] masterlee05: :(
[1:27:11] kaizen_vt: Do you think that with this expansions release along with the release of wrath that WoW will be brought back into the spot light that it once was?
[1:27:46] Gezber: i mean... SL broke sales record
[1:27:51] masterlee05: yeah well wow is still the best mmo on the market
[1:27:58] dutchie76: dragonflight in november Kappa
[1:28:07] masterlee05: even ashes of creation cant compete with wow
[1:28:10] Rudric_Ice: wrath won't be bigger than classic I think
[1:28:21] Thoreya: Sodapoppin is a co-owner of OTK now. That‚Äôs crazy!
[1:28:23] masterlee05: oh there will be much biger
[1:28:26] Aidler: if there are no more distinctive colors left then maybe a color property like metallic or aquarell will do the trick
[1:28:27] dutchie76: treasure room
[1:29:11] UltraContent: what was that 50k crit
[1:29:12] masterlee05: wrath was the latest great expansion wow had! i prefer tbc but many people are voting for wotlk
[1:29:19] RuebeHD: @Towelliee how do you like the dungeon from 1 - 10?
[1:29:37] Rudric_Ice: show logs
[1:29:42] swampt1l: Wrong lol Legion was great @masterlee05
[1:29:54] Gezber: EZ
[1:30:00] SphinxyOCE: nice
[1:30:01] Mojohusk: Shammylicious!
[1:30:02] Rudric_Ice: Pog
[1:30:04] OviTheGray: goblin powa
[1:30:14] masterlee05: @zeuussss_ ofc Legion was super good and i enjoyed it so much playign as DH and the lore etc, but still wotlk was better
[1:30:19] Gezber: that's one boss
[1:30:20] Rudric_Ice: sham is back baby ?
[1:30:21] Maytan26: which alpha in your mind was the most polished on alpha release
[1:30:22] backstreetalright: The past is in the past there is only one patch to move forward
[1:30:23] UltraContent: lighting bolt max damage as ench make no sense tbh
[1:30:34] dutchie76: any bets on what the top 5 dps will be for Mythic+? LUL
[1:30:38] Shrapnel_Sponge: just lik mop, LB top damage
[1:30:44] Thoreya: Preach playing alpha rn LUL guess everyone can stop bitching

[1:34:29] mrbambusxd: that tree is horrible
[1:34:31] Hungry_Sultan: no just saying take both lol
[1:34:53] Manabucho: wait hot hands are that far down?
[1:34:59] dym_jt: But you are 70 already?
[1:35:21] Hungry_Sultan: im surprised they did not give venty ability was chain harvest not good?
[1:35:28] Brutalzen: @dym_jt Scaled to 70 in the Dungeon
[1:35:33] swampt1l: @mrbambusxd has it been datamined?
[1:35:50] dym_jt: @dym_jt ahh okay, yeah the character frame said 70 in the dungeon.

[1:37:16] Hungry_Sultan: really need to see the monk talents .....
[1:37:22] swampt1l: Do you main hunter? @mrbambusxd
[1:37:24] SphinxyOCE: my guess is that DH will be last
[1:37:26] swampt1l: Priest*
[1:38:05] mrbambusxd: yeah I main priest =)
[1:38:14] afirebugg: warlock will probably be last lol
[1:38:15] mrbambusxd: disc was looking really nice with the silence on DS
[1:38:16] Inthezonewow: DH being removed :)
[1:38:18] mrbambusxd: but they sadly removed it
[1:38:24] mogg_chill: how is ele ??
[1:38:33] swampt1l: Oh nice,I‚Äôm a hunter main lol,Since end of BFA @mrbambusxd
[1:38:37] mrbambusxd: searing nightmare is the worst designed spell tho :D
[1:38:38] BonesPog: This may be a dumb question but why is Warlocks best in slot weapon a Dagger @towelliee
[1:38:46] mrbambusxd: nice, i like hunter, looks really nice BM for DF

[1:40:01] GameFreekTV: Do you like the talent revamp?
[1:40:11] Gezber: spending maelstorm makes it hit 5 targets
[1:40:16] Dahlvash2: the talent Hailsotrm makes it cleave
[1:40:29] berserker_strike: @GameFreekTV what kinda question is that? ofc we all do bro
[1:40:53] GameFreekTV: @berserker_strike sorry bruh, we dont all D-ride WoW all day. Havent looked into it in 3 years
[1:41:01] backstreetalright: @gamefreektv talent revamp is it

[1:41:22] Ghostopheles: there's a talent somewhere on the right side that makes it cleave to an addition target per maelstrom spent
[1:41:31] szble: Weirdge
[1:41:35] Gezber: hailstorm talent
[1:41:57] Feelmylight: consume stacks of maelstrom makes it happen
[1:42:17] Dahlvash2: spending maelstrom on chain lightning/lightning bolt makes the next frost shock cleave. so you tend tyo pool for it
[1:42:20] Gezber: lightning bolt or chain lightning instant casts
[1:42:28] Taroko: only LB and CL
[1:42:29] Scoodles91: even healing will consume it
[1:42:30] Ghostopheles: does frost shock consume it?
[1:42:33] Taroko: and heals aswell
[1:42:48] Rudric_Ice: @gamefreektv  KEKW bye
[1:43:37] Rudric_Ice: u using ascendance ?
[1:43:38] swampt1l: There‚Äôs gonna be so many builds in Dragonflight
[1:43:41] Taroko: yeah enhancement has a lot of buttons to press
[1:43:43] Alepouditsa: i like totems
[1:43:55] Taroko: ascendance is more of a pvp thing
[1:43:56] Ghostopheles: i havent really used it much on enhance
[1:44:06] dormeau_1992: Mehico :P
[1:44:08] Dahlvash2: the 3 min cd on ascendance is very meh in dungeons
[1:44:33] backstreetalright: Totems are like magical hardware that harnessed power from nature
[1:45:03] Bodify: Are there any changes to the macro system coming in Dragonflight? Like space for more macros etc.
[1:45:22] afirebugg: same time
[1:45:25] Scoodles91: there was
[1:45:27] Motivess: That was a skill in wrath
[1:45:30] Molvonos: Dropped four totems and then you could move four at the same time too
[1:45:31] Ionis22: i missthe totem bar
[1:45:40] Gezber: getting old :(
[1:45:50] Motivess: you could also use a skill to remove them and get mana bacl
[1:45:59] Molvonos: It's a classical andy thing, most of us wouldnt understand
[1:46:19] KaisenSiru: Wrath PepeLaugh
[1:46:22] venom366: wrong thing @Towelliee LUL
[1:46:22] Rudric_Ice: I think it is a PVP talent now maybe
[1:46:28] Hungry_Sultan: ROFLMAO
[1:46:35] Hungry_Sultan: bertybert epic
[1:47:03] Bain6969: Mrs Doubrfire reference? i am job?
[1:47:58] Wholoveswaffles: @bain6969 Haha yes has to be ü§£ü§£
[1:48:24] Wholoveswaffles: Love that film towVACBOSS
[1:48:24] MoLite_: GM Towelliee!! what gunnar are you wearing?
[1:48:30] Itchywitch806: Are Dracthyr going to be available to create before dragonflight drops like some of the allied races were?
[1:48:42] Bain6969: @Wholoveswaffles i miss Robin
[1:48:44] mrbambusxd: dragon tanks tho, would be fucking amazing
[1:48:52] GiraffeHydra_: I remember good ol 5 man DK runs of HFR, fun times
[1:48:58] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee 1 time a new class comes out without a tank spec....let it go! :D
[1:49:04] lestsunite: may be will get a cloth tank whne thay vring back Mop demo Lock
[1:49:27] Nebulizer87: yeah dk healers and dh healers where are they at
[1:49:31] Bain6969: we still need bard...forget them being a tank
[1:49:32] xnorthtv: It weould be called Prevention
[1:49:41] cptrogers123: Have you watched Westworld? @Towelliee
[1:49:42] ottavianni: dh ?
[1:49:47] ScurvyHyam: demon hunters move around a bunch...
[1:49:52] ScurvyHyam: And they are a tank
[1:49:54] Inthezonewow: @Towelliee Im looking at getting some gunnars using your discount code, only bad review ive seen is the engraving of gunnar on the lens. How do you get on with them?
[1:50:00] KaisenSiru: Evoker with dragon claw attacks!
[1:50:20] BoiAtomico: should've just made Survival hunter a tank, it's in the name
[1:50:29] Molvonos: @Bain6969 Bard aint ever gonna happen, not for WoW.  There's no real place for a pure support class.
[1:50:30] szble: they deserve more black dragon abilities for sure
[1:50:35] Bain6969: @KaisenSiru and dragons breath attacks
[1:50:38] Inthezonewow: oh, in that case it must not be an issue LUL
[1:50:43] croppeast: Dragons / Dragon Scale in general i supposed to incredible hard. So Could work very well :P
[1:51:14] Reckless_Monk: Warden would sound better for tank spec
[1:51:15] Inthezonewow: Was that the Mavericks you just picked up too? They look great
[1:51:42] Inthezonewow: They are just beautiful
[1:51:42] Moobot: No we don't have DF keys....yet....Check with Sloot or PandaTV. They have them for sure. Don't let them tell you otherwise. If and when we get key's Towelliee will let you know
[1:52:27] Eregbueye: whats the spell on your F keybind ?
[1:52:40] Thoreya: Preach playing alpha rn, guess everyone can stop bitching LUL
[1:52:55] MoLite_: I wish they would get more options for reading glasses
[1:53:46] Rudric_Ice: check resto Kappa
[1:53:47] swedint: @Thoreya yeah funny enough since he never whold play it again, kinda like every other streamer that moaned and !quit"
[1:53:49] wakeandbacon95: they should invite more people so we can get more testing done ;)
[1:53:55] Gezber: no
[1:53:59] lestsunite: no
[1:53:59] NEMERL: Yes KEKW
[1:54:01] Lioni1994: No
[1:54:02] Eregbueye: damn no
[1:54:09] agaze31: How long will the pre-patch last and when will it happen you reckon?
[1:54:18] thepaladinjournal: @swedint he said he would stop making content for it, not that he would stop playing altogether
[1:54:25] futomara01: @Towelliee  do specs with locked abilities in talents get 1-2 extra points to spend basicly?
[1:54:39] lestsunite: frpst shock
[1:54:39] Cyony: ancestral shift is kinda a no brainer, great defensive
[1:55:10] NEMERL: @Towelliee they should give us art of the Zappyboy in this spec
[1:55:15] swedint: @vorianloken both accually
[1:55:22] Gezber: @futomara01 you mean the talents that you get automatically for choosing the spec?
[1:55:49] kappaday23: Kappa
[1:55:51] futomara01: @gezber yeah it seems that they get the same points + 2 free talents
[1:56:04] falldrgn: You could say his time was over in a  flash?...
[1:56:08] Gezber: yes. you get those + 31 (at max level) to spend
[1:56:31] lestsunite: wut
[1:56:47] lestsunite: ur missing ur gurst of winds
[1:57:01] Gezber: @Towelliee there's a nature spell crit chance talent on the left
[1:57:21] Bortslay: hey @Towelliee does it feel like these talent trees promote a niche playstyle rather than every spec being able to do a bit of everything? For example, having one *big* ability over having 5 *medium* abilities?
[1:57:31] Gezber: that one
[1:57:49] lestsunite: but u want nature and frost shock
[1:58:15] szble: if anything its easier to get a "bad" build
[1:58:28] Gooseberries: Like 3 templates will be optimal depending on content and those will be shared
[1:58:39] Gezber: right*
[1:58:41] JoJo_EZmode: BBYodaS do any shaman melee abilities work with a 2h weapon?
[1:58:43] Cyony: @picklemick147 in terms of class talents, they are usually utility, or have a dps section you'd end up taking regardless, so thats a tossup. But the actuall spec talents seem to be promoting different damage profiles.
[1:58:47] Ryukotsu: "With power comes responsibility" :P
[1:58:59] Krelivane_: The homogeneous thing atm is that every spec feels like it's a choice between AoE and Single Target.
[1:59:01] Clicklesly: Just don't take any CC and utility, surely the other group members will handle that Kappa
[1:59:24] Cyony: if you want gust, i'd take frost shock->hex->nature crit
[1:59:43] stahlpakt54: you dont need the hex
[1:59:52] schloerp: hey chat! Who else wants the shaman to get a 4th specc? we got resto with water element, enhancer with air element and ele with fire element.... we NEED a tank specc with earth element <3
[1:59:59] Reckless_Monk: there just sooo much shit in the tree for shaman
[2:00:11] thymos_: @schloerp no, 3 is enough
[2:00:29] lestsunite: yes
[2:00:31] thymos_: nvm tank shaman is kinda interesting
[2:00:33] Ghostopheles: no
[2:00:51] lestsunite: shity totems
[2:00:56] schloerp: @Thymos_ oh yes it iiiiis :D
[2:01:02] Cyony: Who cares about totems, they don't do dps Kappa
[2:01:07] Bortslay: @Cyony  yeah fair, it just seems like every spec might have less abilities if you want to do, say, max DPS, you need more DPS enhancing talents, and less CC abilities.

[2:01:58] Niiol__: or thunderstorm
[2:02:02] Rudric_Ice: ngl it feels shaman tree got the most shit in it's talent tree
[2:02:59] Cyony: @picklemick147 not neccesarily true, for shaman, you get a TON of utility options without having to sacrifice dps in your class talent tree. If anything, shaman gets more buttons then before.
[2:03:25] Bortslay: @Cyony oh true, my only experience is with the new frost DK tree
[2:03:58] Bortslay: @Cyony looks like you can really cut some abilities out and boost howling blast and remorseless winter
[2:04:10] postman_quest: thats why we play them
[2:04:14] R2RHIN0: R2RHIN0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! Thanks for all the amazing Alpha content! Get to share my sub on my Birthday!!
[2:04:22] akia03: which cov skill did they get

[2:04:47] thymos_: FeelsBirthdayMan
[2:04:57] Raugdel: FeelsBirthdayMan Clap
[2:04:59] Tauren0309: Happy Birthday Bro
[2:05:02] Kolepto: Yo that backdrop art for that talent tree is fucking awesome
[2:05:09] R2RHIN0: Thanks Towelliee and everyone!
[2:05:58] lestsunite: told u u need frost shock :D
[2:06:00] Rudric_Ice: go full lava burst build Kappa
[2:06:24] dimberg: u reall want stuff on the left
[2:06:52] Cyony: @picklemick147 sure, there will be different experiences amongst different classes/specs but thats great. something for everyone.
[2:06:52] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[2:07:08] Agronair: I hate the storm ele placement on the tree
[2:07:28] KrychaStrimer: this is mostly pvp
[2:07:36] Cyony: yeah, storm ele placement is weird
[2:07:48] KrychaStrimer: the choice node you were hovering over
[2:08:12] Pexaan: wow players gonna be lost moving from 3 options per row to this LUL
[2:08:15] Agronair: Considering that the wording on storm ele talent says that it replaces fire ele, they should've made it a this or that talent
[2:08:23] Pexaan: super fun to theorycraft with though :D
[2:08:43] Cyony: I honestly wish that wasn't the case
[2:09:02] Cyony: i know that it's not going to happen
[2:09:03] ChuckyG0: does maelstrom weapon gives anything for elemental?
[2:09:16] Agronair: @ChuckyG0 no
[2:09:17] futomara01: day 1 visit icy-veins and never change talents again is my approach
[2:09:26] Agronair: Maelstrom weapon is specific to enhancement
[2:09:35] BoiAtomico: there'll be a meta build for specific content and everyone will run it (or similar) so no big chance in that
[2:09:39] Pexaan: yea even with how complex PoE talents are, people still do meta stuff and follow builds
[2:09:41] ChuckyG0: @Agronair so you cant even choose it as ele right?
[2:09:55] MakaiiART: the big thing with trees instead of 3 per row for me, is that you can still choose a good amount of fun stuff without getting super punished not going meta
[2:10:04] Rudric_Ice: I will make my own build it will probably be bad but it would be fun LUL
[2:10:15] thymos_: i want D4 to have similar talent tree

[2:15:46] Cranxjs: why does blizz want you to play dungeons at 70 without lvl 70 talents? kind of weird approach to testing
[2:15:55] polarbearchef: get that thundering paws, lol
[2:17:02] Cranxjs: must be because we do not understand the big picture :D
[2:17:23] OviTheGray: "no talents for you" :)
[2:17:28] polarbearchef: yeah, sounds like a build problem
[2:17:38] rhyswow: could be untertuned come live when you get 70 talents

[2:19:33] Agronair: One thing that really bothers me about the ele tree is that there is talent spot for fire ele and storm ele, and storm ele replaces fire ele. Just feels like a waste talent point.
[2:20:35] fokeriser: @Agronair it's an upgrade and it says replaces so you need to have fire
[2:21:05] thymos_: IonJam
[2:21:08] Agronair: Then why not make it a this/that talent
[2:21:29] Nicoz971: what is max level on dragonflight ?
[2:21:43] Agronair: plus the placement of the storm ele talent is weird, considering it's based around aoe/lightning, and it's on the fire/ST side of the tree

[3:09:35] Rabiahtaro132: Evoker is a cool healer, just needs more range
[3:09:40] SpyCrabbo: that's not on blizzard though, that's just tanks needing to learn about a new healer
[3:09:41] Molvonos: Thats why you start hitting rewind on the tanks and make sure they stay with the group towSip

[3:20:08] m4gnify: @Puppette, "all wow games since BFA" isn't that many
[3:20:10] Korupcija_: if you're EU, it releases 23:59 on a monday or 23:00 for UK
[3:20:41] looney199725: ye gotta love eu launch days staying up all night to get max lvl in like 6 hours

[3:20:48] kiwifruit56: oh so its ok for thatttt to be global release
[3:21:09] DaProfit: ah yeah forgot about the global release time differences

[3:23:20] Cranxjs: @keyastaron_ or just ranges deal with it ;D
[3:23:34] Trip1eThr3at: Any idea what next weeks tree might be? I have heard warrior or mage. Hopefully warrior since that's my main.

[3:24:07] looney199725: your evoker dps was sleeping
[3:24:18] almostdps: healer evokers pump though
[3:24:35] looney199725: so does dps evoker there doing 16-17k rn on alpha
[3:24:39] looney199725: you should be top always
[3:25:53] almostdps: he was doing blue and red
[3:25:54] looney199725: azure strike was jp build
[3:25:57] looney199725: he was doing alot of dmg
[3:26:06] atrexy_: yes the eoa
[3:26:07] atrexy_: aeo
[3:26:10] Molvonos: might have been testng talents
[3:26:13] Mayhem_George: Good day Towelliee, good day  everyone. When are the warrior talents coming for testing? I want to SEEE!!! :D
[3:26:14] Rabiahtaro132: Maybe he was trying a new build thst he made.
[3:26:18] Gezber: firestorm is missing
[3:26:21] selendees: red is  aoe healing blue is cleave st that my impression
[3:26:23] Naturalbeef: Could be gear
[3:26:24] pavepawns: i think he went duo spec which would make sense why his dmg is low if he didnt have enough in either path
[3:26:26] atrexy_: isn't he missing firestorm
[3:26:45] Murderingz: Hunter next!
[3:26:48] almostdps: oh, he didnt have his aoe?
[3:26:57] pavepawns: he did
[3:26:57] Thoreya: praying for mage talents today
[3:27:00] Murderingz: woooo

[3:27:44] MrFanatical: is this patch looking promising?
[3:28:05] Scoodles91: it makes sanse that "the worst" talants come out first, then the more polished ones
[3:28:17] Rudric_Ice: will you test D4 beta if you get it ?
[3:28:31] looney199725: ooo boi is it zoo build time?
[3:28:46] Rabiahtaro132: Aye, Papi
[3:28:50] Dante_theDarkRanger: can we test MM too?
[3:28:53] pavepawns: i assume ur doing m+ build
[3:29:00] geokouts: my main and fav is BM Hunter not much dmg BUT i can solo easily elites on 60 up to 800k health
[3:29:27] okcoolstory: Are u hunter prodigy
[3:29:32] looney199725: bm better get the MM meta treatment mm was meta all sl
[3:29:42] Rudric_Ice: only testing bm ?
[3:30:12] pavepawns: dont get fogged its useless cause ur mding tanks and not pet
[3:31:04] pavepawns: thats new
[3:31:10] Murderingz: yep
[3:31:22] SyWr: @pavepawns is an optional choice if you want to solo some content lets say dungeons
[3:31:45] DecayedmiNt: Did you guys see that BMW is adding a monthly subscription to get heated seats in their cars?
[3:32:06] Dante_theDarkRanger: and chimera shot there
[3:32:09] pavepawns: @SyWr i know but he is going for a dungeon build
[3:32:19] Rudric_Ice: @mint_fanatic  I thought that was a meme wtf
[3:32:20] Youredoneson666: Chimera shot was removed
[3:32:31] Keyastaron_: chimara shot is missing too @Towelliee ?
[3:32:32] looney199725: dont get barrage
[3:32:37] lestsunite: is there even a point playing huter now? considering the huge talent rebuild thay are doing?
[3:32:39] DecayedmiNt: @Rudric_Ice Sadly not.
[3:32:39] Jokervenom1978: They moved Scare Beast thank goodness
[3:32:39] pavepawns: u should go death chakram
[3:32:39] looney199725: ts been bugged forever it pulls the room
[3:32:42] Dante_theDarkRanger: @keyastaron_ yea I meant that
[3:32:47] looney199725: its bad it pulls all the key
[3:32:52] Keyastaron_: you cant
[3:32:52] tawil_at_umr: nah they are trying to see what idiots are ready to pay for @Rudric_Ice
[3:33:04] Keyastaron_: you gotta have 2 points then youll get the next node
[3:33:16] strchsr: @Towelliee Towelliee out here being Chaotic Neutral
[3:33:21] looney199725: could test serpant sting
[3:33:39] DecayedmiNt: @Rudric_Ice Only for British BMW owners currently tho. But the fact it's a thing....
[3:33:47] Nixis: Stampede is a must!
[3:34:04] looney199725: stampede hella fun button
[3:34:04] littlefox611: when i did mine for my hunt i got death chakram barrage stampede adn explo shot if i dont say bs
[3:34:10] Parsa_KHF: get rid off thick hide
[3:34:42] pavepawns: i cant wait for lvl 70 tho. cause as bm u can get everything at bottom row
[3:34:42] Bronthus: you guys know if he will try different speccs?
[3:34:47] TUROK__gg: THICC
[3:35:02] Rudric_Ice: @tawil_at_umr  if people can buy fart jars people will pay for heated seats KEKW
[3:35:14] pavepawns: dont take the trap
[3:35:22] Bronthus: Can't wait to play MM again. Finally looks good
[3:35:36] Killaabeez: yea maybe not taking the trap is good
[3:35:40] balddy321: @Towelliee dont take movement speed, take talents below intimidation
[3:35:42] pavepawns: if u ignore improved traps u can get more stuff bottom row
[3:36:23] pavepawns: remove 1 improved trap for chakram
[3:36:30] balddy321: You just want the crit to assist w/ Barb shot resets
[3:36:31] pavepawns: u get enough for full crit
[3:36:37] DraLeTn: pls show MM-Hunter talents :)
[3:36:37] Nixis: Traps are bs since Wotlk imho.
[3:36:42] looney199725: fook the chakram
[3:36:45] Keyastaron_: 2 % is kinda good ? or
[3:36:54] pavepawns: well max crit or barrage
[3:36:55] Kolepto: Chakrams was actually the LEAST liked covenant ability for hunters
[3:36:59] Bronthus: @DraLeTn  Google dragon flight talent tree calculator and click the wowhead page
[3:37:03] balddy321: you can probably take the improved trap points out
[3:37:13] balddy321: to the bottom left of intimidation
[3:37:18] pavepawns: take 1 point of improved trap for barrage
[3:37:18] balddy321: for the last crit one
[3:37:29] balddy321: you never want barrage
[3:37:37] pavepawns: he wants barrage
[3:37:38] balddy321: it's actually aweful
[3:37:42] Cranxjs: binding shackles counts for party member?
[3:37:47] pavepawns: i wouldnt pick it but he wants it
[3:37:56] tocu: I guess my blizz account is still cool as I seem to have gotten alpha within the last few days ( I have not signed up for it at all)
[3:38:09] strchsr: @Towelliee Did they fix Alpha Predator, I tried using it the other day and it wasn't giving a second charge of Kill Command
[3:38:12] reaprwolf: have you tested barrage on alpha?
[3:38:53] Molvonos: You should def test Barrage while on Alpha.  Stampede + Barrage down packs.
[3:38:54] pavepawns: u will never go left tree
[3:38:56] futomara01: stampede + dire beasts!! more pets
[3:39:09] pavepawns: left tree for bm is useless
[3:39:13] Nixis: Do they stack??
[3:39:14] pavepawns: until they buff dire beast
[3:39:25] looney199725: stomp seems like it will be meta since gingi legit had barb shot resets 24/7
[3:39:28] balddy321: you dont want many buttons.. B/c you'll just lose prio for Barb resets
[3:39:32] jaxiethedog: It‚Äôs going to be so hard to pug big keys when there‚Äôs such a large talent tee üòÇ
[3:40:02] balddy321: @jaxiethedog naa, it's going to be hard to Sim lol
[3:40:11] Thoreya: bm is so back for m+
[3:40:14] Thoreya: 8.3 vibes
[3:40:29] pavepawns: i thought u wanted barrage?
[3:40:35] looney199725: to soon to say without the last tuned numbers
[3:40:35] balddy321: Well, Beast cleave is kinda unfortunate atm. B/c if you want Killer Cleave or w/e you have to basically just spam the 2 back to back and nothing else. B/c we didn't get the longer duration of Cleave
[3:41:14] Sollice: pvp....lol
[3:42:04] pavepawns: no u got 1 too many points in upper tree
[3:42:11] pavepawns: so u could take barrage without

[3:43:43] headshot_hunter6: -- /cast [@focus,help][@pet,nodead,exists] Misdirection
[3:43:54] pavepawns: the issue is they gotta make dire beast useful to actually take the talents for it
[3:43:56] pavepawns: and its kinda sad
[3:43:59] balddy321: Naa
[3:44:03] balddy321: you want the imp damage
[3:44:05] balddy321: you just keep it
[3:44:21] Shrenko: they really need to make more talents usefull. there is too many talents no one will never take

[3:44:57] rappa003: You can make mega builds in DF that arent cookie cutter like they used ot be, which is awesome!
[3:45:36] looney199725: theres gonna be meta builds always is
[3:45:38] dalaraz: @rappa003 eeeh,yes and no
[3:45:40] pavepawns: the issue for bm isnt technically the talents themselves its the dire beast spell itself
[3:45:49] dalaraz: people will just use the meta after 1 week or 2
[3:45:57] pavepawns: it as a spell and effect does less then 10% of any other choice u have as a hunter
[3:45:57] balddy321: @Towelliee you have a link to your logs?
[3:46:02] StarbuckTech: i like having the trees back. More fun to make your own spec rather than use their old "simple" option
[3:46:07] balddy321: I gotta step away but i'm curious what the #'s look like
[3:46:07] Cranxjs: @dalaraz yeap :D and i am not feeling bad for it ;D
[3:46:10] OviTheGray: @dalaraz i wont :)
[3:46:13] Velashen: There will always be a meta
[3:46:23] DaProfit: wonder if rex got alpha for those one shots lol
[3:46:29] dalaraz: well both are fine :)
[3:46:33] rappa003: they're trying to remove min maxing which is a plus
[3:46:47] StarbuckTech: the whole point of having options is well to have options lol. Yes there will be some talents you do not use, but someone will play around with them
[3:46:56] Holysal: @rappa003 that will never happen
[3:47:06] balddy321: @rappa003 You can't remove min/maxing with giving everyone insane raid buffs and CD's
[3:47:07] looney199725: people will minmax gear and talents even if its 1% more dmg
[3:47:14] Skeezitz: you can never remove min max it will always be a thing lol
[3:47:14] Cranxjs: the only "options" here are to decide between single and multi target..
[3:47:14] feydrinpal: If u read the spell Alpha predator u can se it says requires survial spec thats why u dont get it in bm
[3:47:18] kyr_slowbro: The problem with borrowed power was that it went away quickly
[3:47:21] Velashen: Can‚Äôt change the players.
[3:47:33] Sniqi: Tier sets remain as seasonal borrowed power
[3:47:37] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Well tier sets are borrowed power, we will have that, seasonal affixes are borrowed power, we will have that
[3:47:45] DaProfit: I mean instead of going top to bottom they just need to add new specs aka new horizontal trees
[3:48:00] StarbuckTech: unlimited cosmic power... and tiny little living space
[3:48:09] robbo1010: morning
[3:48:16] looney199725: i wish survival never went melee lmao
[3:48:16] Velashen: @daprofit I wish
[3:48:24] feydrinpal: it does in the wowhead talents so idk
[3:48:27] Blasphehmy: Whens Live supposed to lose borrowed power? atleast another month I assume for prepatch with release date?
[3:48:42] looney199725: when pre patch hits i guess it turns off
[3:48:59] reaprwolf: u think BM will be good in pvp?
[3:49:05] Naturalbeef: If only we got Twilight Devastation
[3:49:09] j_bar111: The power is tied to gear
[3:49:12] j_bar111: not your character
[3:49:26] Cranxjs: what happens with the spells from shadowlands? like shapeshift? we just loose them? :D
[3:49:27] StarbuckTech: i was surprised people were saying to you to not take thick hides... you do dungeons and thick hides will increase your pets survivability @Towelliee
[3:49:30] warrenny: @naturalbeef Not gonna happen sadly
[3:49:31] Youredoneson666: @Blasphehmy if its actually coming in Dev, probable start of Nov? depending how long they wanna do it for.
[3:49:32] Strouss: i want monk 4 set as a talent
[3:49:33] Parsa_KHF: @looney199725 ranged dps sucks ass
[3:49:36] looney199725: yes we lose pod
[3:49:45] Youredoneson666: Dec*
[3:49:49] looney199725: thank god ppl will finally learn to use brain isntead of letting pod carry
[3:49:58] pavepawns: @reaprwolf bm will most likely be solid for pvp but season 1 of DF might be rough as season 1 of any pvp usually is heavily 1 shot focused
[3:50:03] Gargkill: @j_bar111 compared to azerite armor? compared to legendary weapon? compared to, every other borrowed power?
[3:50:04] rappa003: do you think legendary drops will become a thin again?
[3:50:07] Dankind64: i MISS td so much PepeHands
[3:50:12] soulshunter876: i dont think missives are needed in this expansion
[3:50:12] atamala: put it on a trinket or as a special effect on a ring
[3:50:13] pavepawns: which bm usually lacks as they are more value dmg
[3:50:14] littlefox611: TD on dk for the theme
[3:50:18] Peoplewhinetoomuch: We need warrior talents asap SMOrc
[3:50:24] j_bar111: @Gargkill its a lot less significant imo
[3:50:31] Scoodles91: give it to prot war, they will still be bad
[3:50:34] looney199725: td on bdk was broken since it scaled its proc with haste bdk had alot of haste
[3:50:50] StarbuckTech: was the eye always in the bottom right corner or is that new with DF?
[3:50:51] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Ye bur no one said we will not have obsidian devastation, or arcane devastation LOL
[3:50:53] calcutr0n: what does prot warrior need?
[3:50:55] Gargkill: @j_bar111 the magnitude was not a factor in the discussion
[3:50:58] Strouss: @Towelliee Do you think they will add a way to track mitigation, like absorbs, healing dmg ect. ?
[3:51:07] saltyohm: Break yourselves upon my body!  Feel the strength of the earth!
[3:51:10] looney199725: ye gushing was op also
[3:51:15] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Wrath music Kreygasm
[3:51:19] Redpandalol: @towelliee make it a Stam trinket with the td proc
[3:51:28] Odd3ty: What happened to chadbomb?
[3:51:34] StarbuckTech: legion classic... yes please
[3:51:35] DeanoTV: truee
[3:51:37] baaronthemonk: nah, mists
[3:51:40] jhajden: theres preach to your left
[3:51:40] precision79: no shot
[3:51:44] Bronthus: Mists easy
[3:52:00] jhajden: he just jumped down
[3:52:04] StarbuckTech: legion was by far the best expansion to level alts in
[3:52:06] Infebdo: hairgonejinn
[3:52:20] Oriion_: The dragon with hair plugs
[3:52:35] warrenny: @starbucktech Class halls made alts great
[3:52:36] mondo091: you might as well be playing retail at that point
[3:52:41] looney199725: oh boi towelliee bout to pull whole room and freak tank out
[3:53:05] SeckSymbols: Qui Gon Jinn
[3:53:05] gat_1000: are either of the chakrams fun to use ?
[3:53:12] calcutr0n: maybe qui gon jinn
[3:53:20] Araphas: @warrenny true, it made me play every class during legion
[3:53:22] looney199725: yes but its bad
[3:53:24] jhajden: its weird they dont have a built in damage meter
[3:53:24] sliproach: star wars reference @Towelliee
[3:53:26] looney199725: like rly bad
[3:53:27] Cranxjs: star wars Qui-Gon Jinn

[3:54:02] Rabiahtaro132: Fun>meta
[3:54:09] RamboStallone: jinn is some nerds reference Kappa
[3:54:17] Oriion_: That is why I have been playing Hunter since Vanilla
[3:54:32] StarbuckTech: huntard main as well
[3:54:48] looney199725: its alpha you can do what you want haha
[3:54:52] dragonkatz: LUL
[3:54:59] ThorH13: Morning @Towelliee Morning everyone
[3:55:16] SeckSymbols: Works for FF
[3:55:18] TenThousandJawsWillDrop: alpha gameplay jessarBongo
[3:55:19] RamboStallone: strimmer privilege, abusing power D:
[3:55:21] Kisswani: I think bots are stopping that from happening
[3:55:25] Strouss: i disagree, i like 2 professions are good. i dont like every profession idea.
[3:55:26] looney199725: wow isnt ff
[3:55:26] Sollice: All professions on every character will turn in to Garrison 2.0
[3:55:30] StarbuckTech: new world as well
[3:55:31] its_hekks: @Towelliee thing is, they dont either.... only like .01% of players do, they rest cant pass the content till its nerfed to the ground anyways
[3:55:32] looney199725: ff is more casual
[3:55:33] NBK_Sethus: let us have all classes on 1 character 5Head
[3:55:33] Sollice: and you will lose econmy and people wont interact
[3:55:35] mavericks312: learning every profession would kill the economy
[3:55:35] Blastojunior: Blastojunior subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Love the insight man! Very excited to get back into WoW
[3:55:41] raye_gaming22: i dont even have the luxury to pick a class or spec be glad you can
[3:55:43] Thoreya: ff andies dont stop huh
[3:55:45] Lostdogal: that's my view on sticking with Night Fae on my DH, I just liked zooming around toughest like sonic the hedgehog with no cooldown on the hunt. great times.
[3:55:47] RamboStallone: i pick the prettier spells
[3:55:50] delaine: I would LOVE having gathering professions on my main in addition to enchanting/alchemy
[3:55:53] SeckSymbols: @Thoreya I play both games but try again
[3:55:56] looney199725: people comparing the 2 games all the time is so annoying
[3:55:58] StarbuckTech: so you do not have to do the grind of leveling an alt
[3:56:03] looney199725: FF is made for more casual players of mmos
[3:56:05] Thoreya: @SeckSymbols point still stands lmao
[3:56:09] atamala: agreed
[3:56:18] SeckSymbols: @Thoreya It doesnt actually
[3:56:21] Kisswani: the AH would be flooded
[3:56:25] DizzyJVD: wouldn't that overload the server with materials?
[3:56:36] Thoreya: @SeckSymbols SeemsGood
[3:56:46] Bruhnders: Yoo, can you change the size of the xp bar to match the action bar?
[3:57:00] Shrenko: you should be able to take one gathering profession with 2 main professions that would be cool
[3:57:01] atamala: guild wars 2 has no problem with inflation of raw goods
[3:57:06] odysseus1: wish I could have had engi teleports on all my alts for SL, that'll be a consideration now
[3:57:08] SeckSymbols: Arent a lot of mats going to be soulbound anyways?
[3:57:08] Strouss: supply and demand all ways takes care of itself until it get ruined by gov or higher power.
[3:57:10] calcutr0n: thats actually pretty awesome
[3:57:13] OviTheGray: What if they give all secondary proffessions but only 1 main? :)
[3:57:14] Kisswani: @Shrenko I think that's more realistic
[3:57:21] Daarksyde: Having all professions on one character would be taking away from the experience and then people would just create ‚Äúbank‚Äù characters more than what they have already
[3:57:33] brothermanjenkins: wideArrive hey chat üëã
[3:57:36] atamala: @Strouss until supply price gouges :D
[3:57:36] Wolfenhoof: @OviTheGray i would take it
[3:57:37] warrenny: @ovithegray Thats worse then now
[3:57:40] tocu: what server is this so I can make a dps to help you in the future ?
[3:57:43] Thoreya: lol
[3:57:54] Thoreya: he seems to be enjoying it
[3:57:59] Rabiahtaro132: if gathering professions were secondary, we would use more materials due to having 2 crafting professions
[3:58:07] Varsader: @Daark11 FailFish
[3:58:08] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:58:09] Velashen: @daark11 I mean that isn‚Äôt exactly qol
[3:58:12] jetributions: man I wish I wasn't working or I'd join
[3:58:20] Strouss: @glubbietv that can only happen longer then a moment when the gov limits other options.....
[3:58:29] SlippieSlik: I think every toon should have ability to gather anything but can only specialize in one for additional pros then have their main single profession like jewel, black Smith, etc
[3:58:53] Kisswani: @SlippieSlik cool suggestion
[3:59:07] warrenny: @slippieslik That could work
[3:59:17] OviTheGray: push buttons, call zoo, dont die, job done :)
[3:59:18] brothermanjenkins: PogWow sleepyTime
[3:59:19] Varsader: @Towelliee make sure to have pet taunt ON people love it Kappa
[3:59:25] jetributions: roll face left to right on keyboard
[3:59:32] warrenny: How many dungeons are there atm? 2?
[3:59:38] jetributions: thats how you play hunter
[3:59:39] StarbuckTech: be cool if blizz added a stock damage meter lol
[3:59:40] Kisswani: yeah 2
[3:59:52] R0yalFluffy: Hey Towlliee just curious if in the default ui you can change the bar colour of the mobs if you have aggro.
[3:59:56] looney199725: told you haha
[3:59:57] OviTheGray: baraaaage :)
[4:00:00] Wolfenhoof: @jetsun_401 You're a DH player, i suppose
[4:00:08] skreng: barrage pull lmao

[4:01:25] Kisswani: danType hacking
[4:02:03] StarbuckTech: 30min till I look to my monitors to the right and start work lol. AHH the work from home life
[4:02:17] blossomcamm: @secksymbols i mean when it comes to crafting I don't really see anything wrong with you having every profession? maybe that's just me idk like every MMO out there you can do all crafting skills so idk? but I def think we should have all secondaries for sure at least
[4:02:36] ThorH13: Warcraft logs: we would like to hack your computer in the middle of your alpha dungoen. Allow? @Towelliee hits allow"" @Towelliee : why are trying to hack me in the middle of a dungeon???
[4:02:37] Ooshraxa: @StarbuckTech Clap love it! Gratz to you :D
[4:02:43] SaltiT: I know its alpha, but what class are seeming to be doing really well and are there any you feel are way behind?
[4:02:49] SeckSymbols: @blossomcamm I agree, I like the fact of having access to all profesions
[4:03:34] K0rzak0v: is is still about keeping up 3 stacks of frenzy ? rotation same as sl?
[4:03:44] reaprwolf: some big critties
[4:04:01] LawnSpeaker: @blossomcamm you do get all secondaries, not all gathering ones though

[4:07:01] Lundrai: He's most of the way done with Wrath's WAs
[4:07:01] CardinalTX: That man should get donations for all the work he puts into it
[4:07:22] Naturalbeef: I switched to Naowh's WA
[4:07:38] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee did you try blood tanking? If so, how was it compared to SL blood?
[4:08:23] jhajden: Naowhs is nice, but i prefer bigger icons
[4:08:24] SyWr: do you believe some addons should be banned?
[4:08:24] Strouss: i think Luxthos has it best for WA, 2nd Sloot.
[4:08:37] headshot_hunter6: the customizability lux is building into his next weak auras is fuycking amazing
[4:08:41] fluh_: you may not like lux's new ones then cuz he is making them more of a horizontal setup like naowhs now
[4:08:45] fluh_: lol
[4:09:11] Strouss: @flush no more horizontal then current.

[4:22:26] mikedmbxl: why u don't have 2 charges or barb schot?

[4:25:47] strchsr: @Towelliee Look at your DPS on the 3rd boss lmao
[4:25:52] looney199725: you cast fire breath at max always
[4:26:22] BleepBloopBloop: beastcleave EZ
[4:27:11] pavepawns: u should take a 2nd charge of barbed shot. makes the playstyle feel better
[4:27:13] BigHeroSixy: I hit the same number on the 1st boss with the mass cd build. Apparently quite a few talents are broken rn on hunter tho.
[4:27:19] looney199725: so chakram is prob the play over stampede sadge
[4:27:39] pavepawns: chakram will always be cause it increases ur dmg by 15%
[4:28:47] pavepawns: take 1 off qaplan (far right 3rd bottom row

[4:29:46] strchsr: @Towelliee I feel like it's not worth taking talent points currently that affect secondary stats since when you're scaled to 70, you have sub 10% of any thing like crit/haste/etc.
[4:29:58] EvoCyberNation: I was hoping for some crazy graphical overhauling with Dragonblight.
[4:30:17] pavepawns: i rly wish i had alpha i wanna test so many different builds D;
[4:30:23] Cabbageman007: Brilliant idea. How about a daily Vault option, but mounts and currency, valor?
[4:30:32] diaperman42069: @Towelliee do you know if some of the ranged abilities in the gen tree work on survival? like explosive shot etc
[4:30:59] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee do you think the expac will be pushed back at all?
[4:31:16] Aquadriel: some shadow work info would be nice sadge
[4:31:19] mavericks312: to make sure shit works for talents when there releasing
[4:31:21] BigHeroSixy: I think thats why. I didn't realize how many things werent working til you got your hands on it LUL
[4:31:28] Templexx: yea talent reworks is a big undertaking
[4:31:59] strchsr: @Towelliee "We want Shadow Priest to be less reliant on casting Mind Flay" but also half the talent points on the right side of the tree augment Mind Flay
[4:32:01] S_lepage16: @Towelliee what reworked class you have played has been the most fun yet?
[4:34:31] futomara01: disco in the AH?

[4:44:19] looney199725: eternity surge and charged bolt
[4:44:22] looney199725: both rly op
[4:44:30] looney199725: charged bolt was doing 60k+ crits
[4:44:30] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[4:44:37] Kriven: @Towelliee what no meat seltzer? LUL
[4:45:24] ZavhenGhorr: @Towelliee Has it ever been discussed for Worgen or even now Dracthyr, to have separate transmog for their human/ animal sides? so that you can have good-looking armor on the humans or visage that looks great but also have something different on the Worgen/Dragon side so they look equally good? Just some thoughts, as I really love worgen but hate dressing them lol

[4:46:35] strchsr: Bruh she was Russian, and she liked it, so idk
[4:46:40] looney199725: eternity surge + charged bolt is needed @Towelliee
[4:46:56] SirNikurasu: @Towelliee How does the Heal Evoker play? Is it reactive or not, etc.?
[4:47:02] OJWestTV: was it really that bad LUL
[4:47:05] strchsr: Apparently it's an actual "cocktail" called kalimotxo
[4:47:13] zimmguy: i like the word balogna
[4:48:01] Jomuse92: only big downside to prevoker is the range
[4:48:26] looney199725: you need eternity
[4:48:28] looney199725: for charged bolt
[4:48:36] looney199725: charged bolt does like 60k crits its rly strong
[4:48:45] Jomuse92: some encounters really cuck the prevoker and wipes happen because of that
[4:49:13] Nauti_: It's so healers don't have the super low cooldown interupt. Also its not locking anything so it's in the best place.
[4:49:18] looney199725: people just need to learn to play around the 25 yard range thats all
[4:49:34] looney199725: on st you only go to 1 stack eternity surge
[4:49:35] Jomuse92: ^
[4:49:38] looney199725: aoe full charge it
[4:49:53] strchsr: @Towelliee It hits more targets the longer you charge it
[4:50:05] looney199725: use the azure procs to make charge bolt slap
[4:50:10] Arch4ik: Do you think Evoker will be top tier for awhile after release? Similar to how DK and DH were
[4:50:23] looney199725: evoker is a weird one
[4:50:29] looney199725: it has alot of CC but squishy
[4:50:34] Rudric_Ice: @arch4ik  by the looks of it no
[4:50:42] looney199725: ye it slaps
[4:50:54] looney199725: that was jps build he was doing 16-17k overall
[4:50:55] strchsr: @Towelliee Someone was talking about Eternity Surge where it hits more targets the longer it's held I think
[4:50:57] looney199725: slapping aoe and st
[4:51:02] Jomuse92: oh man imagine rogue mage prevoker o.e
[4:51:05] NEMERL: 40%*
[4:51:29] Rudric_Ice: evoker only looks good in aoe to me
[4:51:38] Arch4ik: @Rudric_Ice How are the heals? I mained resto sham in mythic Nathria and really enjoyed that
[4:51:39] looney199725: evoker has strong st
[4:51:41] looney199725: atm on alpha
[4:51:42] looney199725: not just aoe
[4:51:50] Jomuse92: @Rudric_Ice charged blast fucks very hard
[4:51:52] looney199725: they just are super squishy
[4:52:23] looney199725: ye
[4:52:25] looney199725: thats how it is
[4:52:31] strchsr: @Towelliee Red for AoE, Blue for ST
[4:52:32] looney199725: pyre is prio for aoe
[4:52:35] Nauti_: You looked at eternity surge yesterday doing almost double Pyre damage per cast.
[4:52:37] Jomuse92: yeah in dungeons they do the red boi stuff
[4:52:39] Nauti_: You just don't spam it
[4:53:05] looney199725: you play hybrid build and your chilling on all parts of key
[4:53:17] quakegoogl: EnlightenD draRage EnlightenD PopCorn
[4:53:24] looney199725: firestorm is a awful spell
[4:53:25] theoriginalzinng: are they doing an ilvl squish in dragonflight or no?
[4:53:29] looney199725: because ppl run out of it 24/7
[4:53:30] Rudric_Ice: @arch4ik  I think for what I saw they are good but they needs to have more range on their abilities
[4:53:35] parad12e: good morning :)
[4:53:47] looney199725: @theoriginalzinng by end of DF tanks prob have 1M hp
[4:53:59] theoriginalzinng: so no then ok lol
[4:54:22] looney199725: they have almost 300K+ without any M0 gear on
[4:54:51] mrz_as: KEKW
[4:55:22] Kickapooh: do covenant abilities persist through dragonflight?
[4:55:55] Pallyofhell: they become talents i believe
[4:56:03] Ezekyler: right click on the buff
[4:57:18] 2xVOD: I really hope Dragon Riding is introduced to the old world zones. Flying will never feel the same.
[4:57:39] CompleteRascal: do you think you'll use UI addons in dragonflight, or is the new blizz UI pretty solid?
[4:57:44] ThorH13: Morning @Nauti_
[4:57:58] looney199725: tbh i can see why they cant  be tanks they would be to op
[4:58:23] looney199725: we dont need more tanks anymore
[4:58:34] looney199725: they struggle with balance as it is
[4:58:40] Rudric_Ice: will we not get any covenant abilities when we lvl in DF through SL ? Or will they be active
[4:58:58] looney199725: i guess we get tinker at some point it will be mail class also
[4:59:33] Siddydiddydo: dang thats a good talent in raids

[5:00:25] lokiemkcuf: WeSmart

[5:02:01] strchsr: @Towelliee I think the double Hover charge is after Source of Magic
[5:03:15] Molvonos: I'm gonna be launching Priests off cliffs with mine.
[5:03:16] Rudric_Ice: will they be OP on release like DK and DH was ? Kappa
[5:03:21] Molvonos: Because fuck Leap of Faith.
[5:04:21] Brodih_: damn thats cool
[5:04:31] Xeron_159: 5 min cd is just stupid
[5:04:31] kaybrink: Wicked
[5:04:31] DragonofWolves: Welp theres no need for flying mounts in cities i guess for Dracythr lmao
[5:04:46] Khalostaran: Fernando Alonso on Dracthyr jaja
[5:04:53] Rudric_Ice: does soar work in oribos ? try it out
[5:05:07] DragonofWolves: Xeron_159 You thinking maybe 3 min? I think that would work better tbh
[5:05:37] mavericks312: dreadfire and hymnal

[5:05:40] Xeron_159: @DragonofWolves neither...think about druid fly form
[5:05:45] Pallyofhell: i think glyph
[5:06:04] Molvonos: Hymn is kinda junk solo tho, I'd imagine Glyph is better
[5:06:10] 2xVOD: My Fire Mage was so upset. He went all of 9.0 and never once saw Soul Ignited.
[5:06:36] Xeron_159: @DragonofWolves u can't use it combat and can't stant still, so i don't see why they should put a cd on that skill, it has no combat porpouse
[5:07:00] DragonofWolves: Xeron_159 True, true, it essentially is a type of flight form
[5:07:02] orionnhawk: How do you like the new UI?
[5:07:10] Xeron_159: exactly
[5:07:20] rosina_scarlett: Whats the fated affix do?
[5:07:52] mavericks312: @2xVOD all my frost mage saw trinket wise was igniter was so heated
[5:07:56] strchsr: @Towelliee Imagine how strong that would be on classes that used the other Nathria trinkets
[5:08:03] Gargantix: what weapons do evokers use? and are they the same for dps and healer?
[5:08:04] Siddydiddydo: gonna have to turn on the vuhdo arrows to show you which direction people are from you
[5:08:12] ceranac23: mr gm getting half level per 1 island run kekw
[5:08:15] PapaBerg: have you gotten any keystones?
[5:08:17] Molvonos: Ehh, as a caster in M+, we ended up staying close to the melee/tanks/healers anyways due to mechanics.
[5:08:19] Pallyofhell: thats why evoker has tanky talents
[5:08:23] Molvonos: So it's not too much a change I feel.
[5:08:41] strchsr: @ceranac23 From 50-60?
[5:09:03] NEMERL: They should invite Rextoy to alpha
[5:09:05] rosina_scarlett: @ceranac23 60-61
[5:09:06] ceranac23: 60-61
[5:09:18] DragonofWolves: Yeah Towelliee do you think Soar just not have a CD? It technically is just a type of flight form
[5:09:33] jkitchin75: @NEMERL now that would be fun
[5:09:35] DragonofWolves: should just not have a CD*
[5:09:41] Aidler: the breaker of things
[5:10:03] Rudric_Ice: @dragonofwolves  this is a blizzard game and you can't have fun
[5:10:07] Xeron_159: i too much to my op
[5:10:26] blntmasta420: munchk4Hyper munchk4Hyper munchk4Hyper
[5:10:32] strike879: imo they should have a glide without cd
[5:10:36] akia03: would it work in pvp
[5:10:41] Xeron_159: soar have no utility in combat, so u use it just for flying, so put 1.5min cd on a druid flyform
[5:10:45] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee thats to much fun tho, no fun
[5:10:52] dutrockbridge: Soar in WSG LUL
[5:10:54] Xeron_159: and also...druid can ista cast it...drachtyr have to cast it
[5:11:15] Rudric_Ice: no lmao
[5:11:15] strchsr: If you can, I can't imagine you can carry the flag with it
[5:11:17] strike879: would be kinda wierd that a dractyr could die from fall dmg when they are on cd
[5:11:29] DragonofWolves: Who needs flag running when you can just fly it to the base lmao
[5:11:37] Xeron_159: there are no reason to on a cd, 5 min cd is just stupid
[5:12:05] strike879: the launch part should have a cd the gliding part not
[5:12:20] andre_scb: warlock talent tree.....when????
[5:12:31] Xeron_159: i'm starting to think that they want soar to be on 5 min cd so u have to use dragons mounts
[5:12:43] Rudric_Ice: WARRIOR TALENT tree today Poggers ?
[5:12:49] Xeron_159: that's the only reason i can imagine
[5:12:54] backstreetalright: Nice everyone is happy so we can all go play DF GlitchNRG
[5:13:00] Spikeel: Paladin talent tree? im scared xD
[5:13:21] pkmnmunchlax: will blizzard update cast animation and spell animation for all classes next expansion ? anyone know ?

[5:49:48] Coriollis: camera pan
[5:49:49] smashwow: Z axis at it's finest
[5:49:57] Russian_water_drinker: LOL. Report this
[5:50:03] Balkep: an earth dragon LUL
[5:50:17] smashwow: i bet mages fall through that with blink
[5:50:19] Tanker01: there will be so much bugs and DC's with this spell. remember the DH? I was disconnecting all the time after dashing through everything
[5:50:29] amricatt: The tailor professional equipment looks so sweet!
[5:50:29] looney199725: what do yall think the next class will be
[5:50:35] Ertra: yall are smashing this place
[5:50:53] looney199725: i assume they will make the next one another mail class
[5:51:17] Luxicake: @amricatt i can finally complete my edward scissorhand tmog with those scissors
[5:51:27] Nixis: @looney199725 rogue?
[5:51:28] GsussMilo: How's the new race?
[5:51:32] chillmodez: do they still have the target cap for dps in dragonflight?
[5:51:50] supernohva_xt: Does Mythic+ come out at launch for Dragonflight?
[5:51:58] looney199725: m+
[5:52:07] looney199725: will be capped like always
[5:52:17] looney199725: they cap m+ so you cant get to strong before raid
[5:52:34] Mikromanagement: you arent the only one
[5:52:43] BigHeroSixy: I think the charging can feel clunky at times
[5:52:45] Jollywhompus: Prob just years of smooth quick rotations now held back by a charge
[5:52:49] Tanker01: no one likes them :D
[5:52:55] Hood______: do you still have it set to hold and release? Maybe swap it to click and click to activate
[5:52:55] amricatt: @Luxicake Yes!
[5:52:56] looney199725: eh i kinda like them its something fresh for once
[5:52:59] lynixxis: They feel out of place in WoW's environment and they feel SLOWWWWWWW
[5:53:09] Mikromanagement: it feels like they miss both a visual and an actual empowered aspect for the ability
[5:53:12] BigJustin26: any news on Paladins or Mages yet?
[5:53:13] Lorilath: i think the empowered abilities need to feel bigger and better
[5:53:23] BigHeroSixy: @looney199725 This is my mindset. It can feel clunky but I want it expanded on cause it could be good yknow.
[5:53:35] Luxicake: o shit we gettin markers for this fight PogChamp
[5:53:45] Lorilath: like more grandiose animations and more impactful to your damage or healing
[5:53:47] smashwow: not really a fan of aiming and having a castbar
[5:53:47] looney199725: evoker is likely gonna be ground work for future classes now
[5:53:57] looney199725: i wouldnt be shocked to see another class come with charged ability
[5:53:57] Animemron: Damn i look forward to taming that mammoth XD
[5:54:12] BigHeroSixy: I was thinking theyd expand new abilities to other classes eventually if the charge skills perform well
[5:54:13] LoSuns: LoSuns subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 132 months, currently on a 132 month streak! towHAMUP
[5:54:33] quentinkil: nice mammoth
[5:54:39] Nixis: I think the class will be hyped the first months. After that most player will go back to there old class. The same was with the DK
[5:55:14] Anderus00: 132 Pog
[5:55:15] thenormalbeast: Which Hunter spec?
[5:55:24] 170617floppen: 170617floppen subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:55:29] looney199725: every new class is hype for awhile
[5:55:35] looney199725: but look at dh alot of ppl still main dh now
[5:55:57] Gr_z: that class colour is the same as monk no? wonder if itll be changed
[5:56:01] noxryl: @towelliee did you try the right side of the survival tree? and does tip of the spear work with mongoose bite?
[5:56:12] Luxicake: its a bit darker than monk @Gr_z
[5:56:17] Coriollis: dh was actualy disgrunted demo players from WoD
[5:56:20] Walshey: darker than monk
[5:56:24] Phiferwolf: Gosh I want to get into the alpha just to BUILD my evoke
[5:56:29] Coriollis: same thing will happen with arcane mages now going evoker xd
[5:56:37] Murderingz: @Phiferwolf same dude
[5:57:06] Phiferwolf: any experience with balance druids yet/
[5:57:16] CanadianFteev: @noxryl yes, but currently mongoose doesn't stack damage amp like it's supposed to do
[5:57:16] amricatt: That's it?  Slacker.
[5:57:19] alatryste: evoker is way overtuned
[5:57:21] Dratomae: I feel like evoker is balanced? They just need to buff other dps specs
[5:57:38] Dratomae: Like shadow doing the same dps as tank doesn't make sense
[5:58:04] noxryl: @canadianfteev omg that's fantastic news, well not mongoose fury not working...
[5:58:28] Cojoha: morning
[5:58:32] WestonTeli: no ones any tuned, peeps are wstill getting trees LUL

[6:26:39] cs_nano: is evoker's main cc a root? or do they have a stun, interrupt, etc?
[6:27:03] shortyforthewin: hey guys a question do you realy need too buy the shadowlands  too get too this new expansion
[6:27:07] Teknofear64: O SNAO, renovated Uldaman?
[6:27:13] Teknofear64: *SNAP
[6:27:38] mavericks312: ew court of stars
[6:27:56] polarursus33: I liked cos
[6:27:59] Adirtan: jade serpent is great, court is just rlly bad decision especially coz we have it when legion timewalking is active
[6:28:00] ijuki: That last dungeon in Legion... can't remember the name of it
[6:28:01] Teknofear64: whats map look like T?
[6:28:10] br3z: cos is like one of my all time favs
[6:28:11] Hazno: @shortyforthewin at the moment because Shadowlands is the current expansion, but traditionally the current expansion becomes enrolled into the subscription when pre-patch for the next expansion is released
[6:28:14] Durithane: CoS was great
[6:28:14] Fugazi811: loved it as well
[6:28:14] ttvlevelis: cort of stars was trash
[6:28:15] Charliex302: from what i understand there will always be 2 dungeons being recycled every season from now on
[6:28:16] Elff11: CoS was so quick its nice
[6:28:17] looney199725: people hate the keys they wiped the most in haha
[6:28:21] br3z: with all the race/class/prof things
[6:28:23] Charliex302: CoS was awesome
[6:28:24] polarursus33: seat of the triumverate
[6:28:24] Texas_Mizfit: will first aid guy still be in court of stars
[6:28:30] strike879: if those dungeons are not part of season 1 can you still do them on M+0 to valor upgrade the gear?
[6:28:33] OmgItsEdizzle: ugh please kill me.. legion WAY too soon
[6:28:37] yzino1992: I'd rather have CoS than Arcway
[6:28:41] Utmost777: I only hate the guess who mini game
[6:28:42] Megadisaster24: Maw Of Souls was way better
[6:28:43] suvati68: I like violet hold
[6:28:45] cookie_jayy: I love long dungeons
[6:28:46] Hazno: @shortyforthewin in other words, if you don't have Shadowlands right now and don't wanna pay for it, just wait and buy Dragonflight closer to release
[6:28:52] Aquadriel: arcway monkaS
[6:28:54] shortyforthewin: @Hazno ty for the answer
[6:28:56] OmgItsEdizzle: I want mythic plus DEADMINES
[6:28:58] ttvlevelis: i like arcway over CoS anyday
[6:29:10] mavericks312: yea id take arcway over CoS
[6:29:15] Texas_Mizfit: they will give us both for the set items
[6:29:21] Adirtan: CoS is great gameplay wise i agree, i just dont like that choice coz we literally have it when timewalking is up, they should have pick something different
[6:29:29] ijuki: The Seat of the Triumvirate Kappa
[6:29:32] Teknofear64: lets see map T
[6:29:39] youngsinatra_x: is shadow priest performing well so far in alpha?
[6:29:42] br3z: they arent doing legion time walking M+ again though
[6:29:48] strike879: with infinite dragon flight mythic deadmines could happen
[6:29:49] shortyforthewin: the grafic looks so much better or maybe i havent played for ages hehe
[6:30:04] Teknofear64: thanks
[6:30:16] polarursus33: wipes of the triumverate
[6:30:23] Adirtan: @shortyforthewin i play the game basically nonstop and i have to say sso far DF looks way more detailed and stuff, its awesome
[6:31:31] shortyforthewin: nice

[7:20:45] odawgxd: Bear looking dog now after the changes compared to before tho
[7:20:48] ShadeofIcarus: @fire_fawkes The funny thing is at least numerically Feral is actually pretty good assuming. The design space it exists in is problematic though
[7:21:02] Sacuri: i thought there are more Ui Changes ? like Hp bar etc or just not yet ? @Towelliee
[7:21:06] mavericks312: it could be a mega dungeon if they added a boss or 2

[7:25:14] Sleepylol93: I hope they add lots of UI options

[7:27:20] Zippaya: I'm drinking some great homemade beer, cheers
[7:27:26] cruzeal: would be cool
[7:27:27] mavericks312: @Rage667 does the EU sell redbull and monster?
[7:27:32] MatyNGU: is this the only dungeon that is out on the alpha atm?
[7:27:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tough raid bosses are fine, but yeah not insane ones
[7:27:43] freetherocktv: @itouchbuttons Its for the dragonflight raids so we have not scene the changes yet
[7:27:45] sliproach: @mavericks312 yeah
[7:27:51] Rage667: @mavericks312 yes it does
[7:27:56] love_eggplant: what content is releasing on alpha next week?
[7:27:59] MatyNGU: @mavericks312 yeah, i drink monster everyday almost xD
[7:28:00] love_eggplant: do u know yet
[7:28:05] mavericks312: @Rage667 same shit different name
[7:28:13] itouchbuttons: @itouchbuttons so they haven't changed core gameplay being the highest level to get to and unlocking the rest of the game to play
[7:28:35] iCarDog: just make every boss fight a banger
[7:28:42] dracullus: @Towelliee I would prefer 8 bosses every 5 months over 10 bosses for 7-8 months
[7:28:52] sliproach: @mavericks312 red bull monster relentless, rockstar you name it it's here
[7:28:55] freetherocktv: @itouchbuttons no need to troll have a good day bud
[7:28:56] Rage667: @mavericks312 Advanced has Aminoisoheptane which is considered to have the same effect as amphetamine
[7:29:01] Wcvechten: sometimes 9, sometimes 7, but stay around the 8
[7:29:17] itouchbuttons: @itouchbuttons not trolling actually curious what you think the gameplay changes would be?
[7:29:28] Enlargamus: honestly even those guys during the race were like "this is too much"...max seemed like that at the end at least
[7:29:30] ditaern: any plans for single boss encounters again?
[7:29:48] OviTheGray: Onyxia 3.0, 1 boss raid :)
[7:30:01] matching_towels: It‚Äôs a lot less work for them to have a ‚Äòraid buff‚Äô to help with increasing power, rather than multiple nerfs
[7:30:11] dracullus: maybe something we see already with 9.2
[7:30:17] Frenaris: so Towelliee, we got high hopes for this expansion?
[7:30:23] highlydegen: have you and preach talked at all about the last few days with the whole alpha "drama" or whatever
[7:30:36] mavericks312: @Rage667 yea its like legal adderall
[7:30:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: 3 boss raids can be alright, I think
[7:31:08] KorbinnVeraci: @Towelliee Did you enjoy Shadowlands overall?
[7:31:13] dracullus: no new scandal and we will be fine
[7:31:13] mavericks312: you mean the sylvanas fight wasnt fun for 15 minutes at a time lol
[7:31:15] aribellae: damnit Towelliee, my husband is gonna make me stop watching you again, I order everything you talk about >< Luxthos peach tea inc.
[7:31:17] Silverbrit: I just want content without waiting 9 months
[7:31:19] freetherocktv: @itouchbuttons if you are being condescending that is trolling bud and your reply's were not genuine curious they were to trigger me or someone else, try that in another channel please thanks.
[7:31:24] chipmunkings: that Dragonflight intro cinematic tower if it were a raid of a dragons' aspect nest would be POG
[7:31:40] whyabadi: It's not ethical design
[7:31:43] looney199725: tier is staying its gonna be like that forever
[7:31:48] Keglett: Halondrus was some of the best prog I've ever witnessed
[7:31:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was brutal to watch them wipe over and over, day after day
[7:31:54] looney199725: if they want 4set before they go in they will do same
[7:31:55] teeq_010: the Race needs to start on the same time aswell and not always NA starts first ... but thats just how i think about it
[7:32:08] Rage667: @mavericks312 definitely not something i would advertise
[7:32:09] matching_towels: Yes, tho it was good content LUL
[7:32:09] Densetsu_: How long was the Denathrius fight? Only played the HC version but I think that was a great fight and good length.
[7:32:14] mavericks312: @teeq_010 never gonna happen
[7:32:19] Kelticlore: towelliee whats your initial thoughts on dragonflight
[7:32:22] strike879: @Towelliee imo they should make a boss that is actually 2 bosses so its kinda a 20 min fight but you save and get loot at the 50% and at 0%
[7:32:38] teeq_010: @mavericks312 than dont do a race if theres different starting times

[7:45:02] Daan0605: @towelliee what‚Äôs under special and anvil?
[7:45:15] EthicalHermit: never happening
[7:45:19] Kriven: i dont like that
[7:45:19] Keyastaron_: are we really going to be paid 1 million - 2 million making a work order?
[7:45:21] Jelanipatron: WoWRunescape lol
[7:45:21] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: should make one character be all classes as well
[7:45:22] shagrath19: or at least able to have all gathering professions on the same char?
[7:45:23] Shrenko: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[7:45:24] SpyCrabbo: that sounds awful
[7:45:25] aribellae: they should at least open up gathering professions
[7:45:26] rosina_scarlett: I think 1 character should be able to do all professions and play every class
[7:45:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: i could see streamers being fed work orders to level professions quickly
[7:45:27] house573: would that kill economy though?
[7:45:31] log_in2: you can already do that just make alts KEKW
[7:45:32] CptSpock: that is FF14
[7:45:44] infinityarty: account wide gathering proffs
[7:45:45] OviTheGray: nah.. i like different alts with different proffessions :)
[7:45:45] willie_zenn: Wait he's playing Illidan Horde on launch? Fuck me.
[7:45:47] Fimbulforge: would be cool if you could dabble in other professions, like the garrison buildings in WoD
[7:45:48] rosina_scarlett: TBH. Mining, Skinning and Herbing should be seconday profeccion
[7:45:48] akia03: shame 1 prof is still locked to engi and 1 to alch
[7:45:51] Leggo_Saiyan: @hemzi84 economy already dead.
[7:45:52] Gezber: that fine
[7:45:56] shagrath19: @Towelliee that would be amazing
[7:45:57] zenkodac: that would be amazing
[7:46:02] SirMouSe: @hemzi84 not anymore than bots are already doing :P
[7:46:03] kappaday23: Keepo
[7:46:09] Zippaya: I dont think they doing that
[7:46:11] Holysal: @willie_zenn what does that matter?
[7:46:12] Shrenko: yesss
[7:46:13] keiawoah: never thought about professions being all on one character. hell, i'd rather have account wide reputations.
[7:46:13] Daan0605: @towelliee what‚Äôs under special and anvil?
[7:46:14] ArcaneMaki: I don't like secondary profession as global. I like the economy that comes with separation.
[7:46:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: That would help, effectively adding a second primary profession
[7:46:17] log_in2: man some things people ask for make me wanna run into a wall
[7:46:18] LordOfTheMallards: dreadnoughtusx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[7:46:25] billybaroo1: Why not just buy a token instead of leveling professions?
[7:46:32] Featherbow: or at least give us the gathering profession that compliments the professions we pick
[7:46:36] y0rtek: toss me an inv to that discord right quick MiniK
[7:46:40] Shrenko: fight harder Towelliee üò°

[7:46:43] strike879: or no gathering prof just get a little bit of material have gathering prof have all the perks get more mats
[7:46:47] NEMERL: Everyone should gather everything
[7:46:49] almostdps: all mats are worthless
[7:46:51] Kriven: I like that it requires you to work with other people
[7:47:03] ncatter: only one primary profession per account thats the money maker
[7:47:24] Leggo_Saiyan: Exactly.
[7:47:25] ArcaneMaki: I did not like that in New World.
[7:47:36] shagrath19: exactly
[7:47:38] mavericks312: @ncatter i disagree, herbing and mining can make 10x the amount of say tailoring or BS;ing
[7:47:38] rosina_scarlett: TRUE
[7:47:39] rival_xo: your mic is so gud
[7:47:40] Slitze: what if you F up that flower because you don't have the knowledge
[7:47:41] cruzeal: like tera or new world
[7:47:41] almostdps: because you destroy it with no skill
[7:47:42] Leggo_Saiyan: That‚Äôs a shit thing. You should be able to
[7:47:42] Zippaya: :D
[7:47:43] strchsr: @Towelliee Can't pick that flower, your hands are broken
[7:47:44] twogungaming: preach my brother
[7:47:45] Volatilestyle: how are they going to give any usefulness to professions under level 70
[7:47:46] kokochris: because my giant bear hands will mangle it.. and it wont be useful any more :(
[7:47:47] Tury4l: @Towelliee here's an idea. proffession slots are point based. so if you learn BS once then you can choose 2 things (armor / weaponsmithing) to max out. if you learn blacksmithing again or rather use that second point on BS again then you can learn all of it.
[7:47:47] shagrath19: that's what i liked in ESO that we could do all kinds of gathering
[7:47:47] sliproach: you no pick flower
[7:47:50] twogungaming: preach
[7:47:50] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[7:47:55] SirMouSe: Exactly and you would totally know what flower to pick because EVERYONE have the knowledge of course :D
[7:47:56] amricatt: I'm excited to see the changes in professions.  You're right though.  All gathering should be secondary.
[7:47:57] twogungaming: makes no sense
[7:47:59] ZangetsuVMG: You might destroy the flower be picking it not in a proper manner
[7:48:00] Featherbow: some RP justification could be that you don't have the knowledge to recognize what said flower is
[7:48:02] CptSpock: because you dont have the knowledge that the flower is useful
[7:48:06] Hyelander_: My lawn is all overgrown, because I haven't learned gardening.
[7:48:09] Leggo_Saiyan: Banana hands can‚Äôt pick a flower.
[7:48:11] Meakis: yeh dawg, just dig in yourbackyard, you'll find gold
[7:48:11] Kelticlore: @towelliee thoughts on patterns not learned from trainers be learned account wide
[7:48:13] PokerFaceMoose: skinning takes skill
[7:48:15] xd_pad: "I am the Maw Walker. I have slain ancient beings that wield incredible power. I cannot swing a pickaxe"
[7:48:23] nightwolf_87: @Towelliee but in business prospective, alchimist will not be happy since the flask will be way too cheap then due to over resource.
[7:48:24] insaneinthebrain3: LUL
[7:48:26] Wolfenhoof: @shagrath19 Or everquest 2, FF, basically in any decent mmorpg.
[7:48:27] awesometailz: You wouldn't be able to tell that flower was an herb without herbalism knowledge
[7:48:29] chipmunkings: it's more like "you can't harvest this mushroom because it could be poisonous" get maor knowledges LUL
[7:48:38] Eviltuna13: Common sense burn the witch cohhChaos
[7:48:39] Zippaya: only strenght
[7:48:39] Strykerz_x: what if your amount you receive is greatly reduced without learning the skill ?
[7:48:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: orc smash rock
[7:48:42] y0rtek: nah youll fuck the ore up if you dont know HOW to hit the rock
[7:48:43] ActuallyNico: They could make a quest out of it. Pick the flower, take it to an Herbalism NPC, that starts a quest chain to learn how to identify herbs
[7:48:44] DuransHybrid: they should just allow everyone to gather, but if you don't have proff you always get tier 1 results (the lowest quality)
[7:48:45] Volatilestyle: mining is forging too
[7:48:49] OviTheGray: without herbalism knowlege, some herbs might be poisonous :)
[7:48:49] Kittastrophe: i think back in the day it made better sense because limitations of looting, but sharing the same node now at this point makes it silly
[7:48:50] ijuki: I rather have someone who can hit the right rock than the wrong one Pepehand
[7:48:53] ncatter: @mavericks312 wasnt talking about gold, I ment if blizzard locked your entire account to only one main profession the would make the big money, was kinda ment as a joke :)
[7:48:59] Wcvechten: Mining would require proper technique to get the desired ore out with damaging it, ontop of identifying it realistically
[7:49:08] AnionCation: Foraging irl does take a lot of skill though - you have to know what is the correct plant to pick. Mining is hard to know how to get softer materials out without ruining the quality of the ore, etc.
[7:49:11] Kneckt: It makes sense with the order system for sure
[7:49:12] PokerFaceMoose: also azeroth has all these machines and stuff. why cant the gnomes have made an auto miner or auto skinner so i dont have to do physical labor
[7:49:20] Fluisterwoud: not every flower is a herb
[7:49:21] Zippaya: ppl alredy going with alts for that, why not do everything on main
[7:49:23] abracka_: they should just go nuclear like LA did with bots
[7:49:28] Leggo_Saiyan: To late. They already have alts for everything they need.
[7:49:29] Korupcija_: why, bots have mining and herbalism already lol
[7:49:31] Wolfenhoof: 50% of the mats are made by bots anyway
[7:49:34] d1stract10n: @Towelliee I will hate druids more if they just fly in and take every node 24/7
[7:49:35] Leggo_Saiyan: Bots aren‚Äôt going anywhere.
[7:49:35] Tury4l: mining need skills to mine out gems without damaging them etc
[7:49:36] Kneckt: Yeah
[7:49:38] strike879: but bots already all have mining/herbalism
[7:49:43] LeDerpski: consumables also
[7:49:45] shagrath19: yeah, region wide AH for those
[7:49:45] oizo99: y
[7:49:47] Kneckt: All herbs all consumables
[7:49:47] ijuki: POGGERS ?
[7:49:53] looney199725: its gonna be bad
[7:49:56] Kneckt: Phials potions too
[7:49:58] looney199725: herbs and all worthless already
[7:50:00] PokerFaceMoose: quite frankly, i think the biggest concern in azeroth is automation. the gnomes and goblins are going to replace us with automatons.
[7:50:16] Zippaya: its gona be cheap tho
[7:50:21] Leggo_Saiyan: Especially with flying off the bat. Bots will flood the market right at launch.
[7:50:28] Kriven: ohh our alternate helmets are FIRE https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1550495002673004545
[7:50:39] oakenzz: Waait what is this? Blacksmithing? looks isck
[7:50:50] looney199725: being cheap isnt good most ppl pick those up to make there gold
[7:50:53] mavericks312: bengals have some fire alt jerseys this year
[7:50:55] deadlykillah: towShappens
[7:50:58] premierman90: 100% agree
[7:51:02] Spotmonk: what if it was a secondary for everyone and you don't get as much as someone who has it as a primary?
[7:51:13] laeenaravenholdt: laeenaravenholdt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! Let's gooooooooo
[7:51:13] almostdps: Gathering is already going to be worthless with region wide, it would be even more worthless if everyone just had em
[7:51:13] Kelticlore: havent people been asking for gathering ptofessions be secondary professions
[7:51:16] Korupcija_: blizzard post!!!
[7:51:33] JellonaCub: How many professions have benefit in combat? JC got more secondary stats for ex?
[7:51:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: On my main, I have leatherworking and tailoring....which means I have to use an alt to farm skinning mats
[7:51:47] Tyrammus84: tyrammus84 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[7:51:51] almostdps: wintergrasp gross
[7:51:57] amricatt: It isn't how many people have the skills but how lazy are people?  Some people will just want to buy it regardless.
[7:51:58] Gezber: "battle"
[7:52:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Instancing is good, it needs it
[7:52:04] Thoreya: i hear towelliees drunk voice LUL
[7:52:11] gruntpunch: the battle that never ends
[7:52:14] Shrenko: heeeelll noo not reading all that
[7:52:14] DuransHybrid: i mean 100 players out of 20k would never be good
[7:52:16] SirMouSe: how you gonna have Wintergrasp on realms where there is 99.8% of 1 faction xD
[7:52:17] highlydegen: They changed it to be like warfronts
[7:52:17] Kneckt: towKawaii towKawaii towKawaii
[7:52:18] DuransHybrid: it's instanced
[7:52:19] infinityarty: its removed
[7:52:19] ozzerlol: tldr: instanced
[7:52:20] ozzythegreat: Its now a queue
[7:52:21] Farfic: instanced epic battleground
[7:52:23] Leggo_Saiyan: Give us back group finder!!!!
[7:52:27] dimofodi: My work finally blocked Twitch so I can't watch when I go to the office anymore? Life isn't worth living.
[7:52:28] Wolfenhoof: @almostdps no it won't be, it will be only be noticable on low pop servers. in general you get 1000 times more material as well as 1000 times more buyers. i just wonder how they will handle the auction-house lag
[7:52:31] Kneckt: towStop towIt
[7:52:33] Farfic: doesn't say
[7:52:39] highlydegen: its Warfronts basically now
[7:52:42] HighThereBud: @Thoreya lmaoo <3
[7:52:43] Exxcar: @dimofodi Use your phone!
[7:52:44] Fimbulforge: servers are so unbalanced it has to be region wide
[7:52:52] Kneckt: towRee towRee towRee towRee towRee
[7:52:57] mavericks312: why wintergrasp was fine the way it was
[7:53:03] almostdps: its gonna be retail version
[7:53:06] looney199725: haha they need to stop calling them classic cuz they change so much
[7:53:07] highlydegen: its just a big giant Warfront + Epic BG
[7:53:21] Shrenko: so basically retail version ?
[7:53:34] Leggo_Saiyan: Just give us group finder back at this point. Wtf.
[7:53:42] PapaJohnz23: so we can queue for bgs but its not okay to queue for dungeons ?
[7:53:43] Scraggersmeh: I mean it doesn't even work without it.
[7:53:45] Thoreya: but they wont do dungeon finder
[7:53:45] DuransHybrid: still has tenacity
[7:53:46] zoovthepally: Seems  lazy to me
[7:53:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep, and it's good
[7:53:47] Thoreya: lolololol
[7:53:48] Scraggersmeh: Gehennas has 0 alliance on it.
[7:53:49] Meakis: Not opposed to it
[7:53:49] highlydegen: but they dont want RDF, got it
[7:53:51] Scraggersmeh: So Horde would win always
[7:53:54] Pudgypantss: of course. How you going to have wintergrasp with 99% one faction server lmao
[7:54:04] Spotmonk: they're probably concerned there won't be enough people
[7:54:27] log_in2: they literally already have lfd
[7:54:27] Shrenko: dont read the comments
[7:54:27] Leggo_Saiyan: Give us LFD!!!!!!
[7:54:30] Beonit: lfd?
[7:54:34] mavericks312: they probably know horde is gonna over run the alliance
[7:54:35] Utmost777: so backwards
[7:54:38] Beonit: looking for dick?
[7:54:39] highlydegen: RDF will be back before Launch, mark my words
[7:54:44] DuransHybrid: if it's in the original state, 100 ppl out of 20k it's also really restrictive you'll never get in
[7:54:44] Brodih_: @Beonit looking for dungeon
[7:54:45] ozzythegreat: should be for leveling IMO
[7:54:47] Scoodles91: #nochanges...
[7:54:47] oakenzz: @Beonit Looking for dungeon
[7:54:52] Leggo_Saiyan: Wrath will die without lfd
[7:54:55] Kasvot_Vaxt: the just didnt want to port it cause theyre lazy and want to frame it as "for the community" i bet
[7:54:55] Beonit: lol ok

[7:55:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: once the boomer dads have to spend half their play time looking for a group each night we will get lfd
[7:55:06] cruzeal: straight outta ff14
[7:55:07] HighThereBud: New World kek
[7:55:09] CptSpock: RDF wont be in since they need more money
[7:55:12] Nachozdood: lol can you run with them?
[7:55:12] pavepawns: edward would be proud of our scissors
[7:55:13] amricatt: I love it.
[7:55:17] zoovthepally: So what is the point of wintergrasp then?
[7:55:21] Beonit: they needd a duty support like ff14
[7:55:24] Kasvot_Vaxt: i heckin love spamming /4
[7:55:25] Hyelander_: are you allowed to run around with the scissors?
[7:55:27] nesman27: the model posing with em looks like he used those things on his head lol

[7:55:55] sliproach: @Nachozdood should be a achive rfun 100 meters with sissore obtaining no injuries
[7:55:56] looney199725: when you start messing with stuff and changing its not classic
[7:56:04] Leggo_Saiyan: Classic team is clueless
[7:56:06] Kneckt: Still 30 mins til 10!
[7:56:07] Exxcar: Its only 9... the big posts usually come at 10 or later right?
[7:56:08] Kneckt: Could be more
[7:56:13] Kriven: i mean honestly i don't even caree about wotlk its all about alpha now
[7:56:23] Exikos: did you try shadow priest?
[7:56:30] Broomba: do you think they will make a season 2 of the Players @towelliee ?
[7:56:30] Kneckt: Lmao candys

[7:57:06] ijuki: @ogthumbless monkaS
[7:57:06] CptSpock: newsflash: they dont listen to the community

[7:57:17] Broomba: KEKW

[7:57:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: his solution is to just make more friends KEKW ok bro
[7:57:44] goofywizard: Damn RIP Asmon
[7:57:48] jkitchin75: @MadBarber44 towStop towIt towCopium
[7:57:50] baloo_the_bear_: We have to create the illusion of community in 2022 by having chat spam.

[7:57:55] Leggo_Saiyan: Streamer privilege
[7:57:57] looney199725: @MadBarber44 ??
[7:58:14] log_in2: @MadBarber44 you understand that there will be an lfg just not the one they had in wrath?
[7:58:18] ijuki: @HaxzorJimDuggan Friends? Is that something good? monkaS
[7:58:21] Ranualf: Wrath was epic.. vs classic, the green hand down beat most epic(naxx not so much)
[7:58:25] Floormat_tv: Asmon been preaching that since Vanilla was announced. Social experience thing
[7:58:29] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Redpandalol (warning)
[7:58:32] Leggo_Saiyan: @premierman90 the new lfg is crap.
[7:58:34] Exikos: i remeber when i had 10+ppl in my friend list and all of us had same game scesude after school, and had good players on that friend list, after lfd that went away
[7:58:35] Gezber: @Kasvot_Vaxt i dislike it for multiple reasons: the random queue (especially if region wide) and teleporting to dungeons, which kills the world. i'd rather just plan my group with guildies
[7:58:36] Zwarx32: good take
[7:58:48] Redpandalol: Oop
[7:58:53] Eredestra: CLASSIC SHADOWLANDS PogChampion!!!!

[7:59:09] Anpeo: sstvEmcel
[7:59:10] looney199725: its all old content thats easy asf for todays game
[7:59:12] Korupcija_: nobody wants classic past wrath
[7:59:20] gruntpunch: They should just allow you to jump between expansions on retail. Instanced expansions.
[7:59:20] Ranualf: remember load of classic dungeons were 15 man instances..
[7:59:21] Gezber: @Leggo_Saiyan it doesn't work if LFD is the default
[7:59:23] Meakis: The only content now is optimal Gold farm route for the gdkp runs

[7:59:39] Gezber: no
[7:59:44] log_in2: toxic
[7:59:45] Kasvot_Vaxt: @Gezber that's fair tbh I just wish they would add some kind of group finder like the bulletin board addon so I dont have to spam /4
[7:59:52] Korupcija_: @Scraggersmeh ye, doubt
[7:59:54] jkitchin75: @Korupcija_ who
[7:59:56] Adeppttt: cata = trash
[7:59:57] Thoreya: gimme bfa classic to do warfronts and farm ap
[8:00:04] Scraggersmeh: @Korupcija_ Doubt all you want buddy.
[8:00:22] Gezber: @Kasvot_Vaxt they do want to do that. they're working on the UI for a LFG tool (kinda like for mythics in current wow)
[8:00:27] Broomba: its business, but its over done
[8:00:38] Korupcija_: @Scraggersmeh just like lots of people wanted classic fresh :)
[8:00:40] Exikos: ijuki: lucky but it is a still thing what probablty happened a lot of ppl
[8:00:41] nothumbgamer_ttv: @Thoreya THD on alt account?
[8:00:42] Kasvot_Vaxt: @Gezber oh sick! im happy then tbh

[8:00:52] Thoreya: @ogthumbless LUL LUL
[8:00:56] RiptoreCA: We assuming the Sept 26th release is correct?

[8:02:17] RiptoreCA: Will Ulduar be out prior to DF is the question?
[8:02:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: That puts it roughly 3 months before the proposed Dragonflight launch, it's not the worst timing
[8:02:26] looney199725: people have mad delusions that old expacs were ever balanced
[8:02:26] Ranualf: after all these year, ppl still pay to play classic...
[8:02:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Qazh_ one of our main tanks literally logged out for about 15 minutes
[8:02:34] kile22: kile22 subscribed with Prime. 
[8:02:34] primesize: September 26th is the release date?
[8:02:34] Kasvot_Vaxt: Kappa
[8:02:35] Thoreya: bc and SL were like 2 months apart

[8:03:18] mavericks312: you will top meters as a prot pally
[8:03:19] ijuki: monkaS but they start at lvl 1 Pepehand
[8:03:24] Gezber: blood will have a spot too, but prot is best
[8:03:24] Odinslayer: wrath was the only expansion were all 3 specs of paladin were op
[8:03:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: In Wrath, Paladin tank is boss....and DK tanks are good and will likely be secondary tanks in raids
[8:03:28] RiptoreCA: Free level boost
[8:03:28] Shaele: dk was dps in wrath, it sucked as a tank tbh
[8:03:29] ijuki: I haven't even made a char on classic server at all
[8:03:38] RiptoreCA: Boost to 70 a paladin and roll into Wrath
[8:03:41] lynixxis: Vezzax
[8:03:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: i spent all of tbc seal twisting as ret, now im going to be a 1 button macro andy in wotlk

[8:04:22] Ranualf: indeed, heal you to death.. and pray you didnt get 2 hpala in pvp..
[8:04:22] RiptoreCA: Holy Pally is OP too right?
[8:04:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrath basically fixed the awful mana problems for prot paladins
[8:04:35] Leggo_Saiyan: Exactly. Trash.
[8:04:41] Ranualf: true, i even had a hpala!
[8:04:48] baloo_the_bear_: So much gatekeeping.......
[8:04:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Odinslayer current tbc servers move to wrath, the fresh servers are brand new starting from level 1 for people that choose that
[8:04:55] Jardon00: they should have just left regular groupfinder in, but no, people want that rose colored glasses shit
[8:05:04] almostdps: tanking for 500g and all unneeded blues
[8:05:05] wastedxtime93: Get higher gear score?
[8:05:07] ijuki: I wanted to dungeon level as tank... but RIP that idea
[8:05:09] kapparN: leveling in 2 days and spamming heroics/mythic 0 might be the progression system of dragonflights, right? there's no main mandatory campaign, no covenant/renown level, no twice torghasts a week ... just play the fckin game? wowzers @Towelliee
[8:05:14] Ranualf: yes Gscore was soo bad, and uber toxic for the game :/
[8:05:17] Spathotan: Bad group finder + classic andys = LOL

[8:05:35] illanxiety: hi chat, which healers are doing the best on alpha from what you have seen?
[8:05:37] the_general01: @wastedxtime513 if you cant get a group, you cant get a higher gearscore my guy
[8:05:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Once they get a few hundred forum posts from warrior and bear tanks that can't get runs, and people waiting hours and hours on paladin tanks, yeah LFD
[8:05:45] Scraggersmeh: Imagine thinking you need to giga optimise WRATH CONTENT. Literal residentsleeper raidlog content.
[8:05:47] Scraggersmeh: To do things.
[8:05:50] Ranualf: all these newb evoker-- LOL my frost dk beats you...
[8:05:53] Ashensakar: @Rocx7604 what kind of question is that? ofc there will be
[8:05:54] Kale_Nd: Gehenas eu will be a shitshow for the groups finder with 30k+ players
[8:05:58] RiptoreCA: Is the better experience, fresh Wrath server or just rolling with existing?
[8:06:01] Nevindaz: but who cares.. in wotlk you dont have to push m+ keys lol
[8:06:02] mavericks312: @futomara01 that solves nothing
[8:06:07] almostdps: do casuals play tbcc? will they play wotlkc?
[8:06:11] Tanderstruk: I remember it was the same thing back in the day when I was doing the 3 dgs on icecrow
[8:06:11] Kasvot_Vaxt: that hasnt been my experience in TBC

[8:09:00] highlydegen: have you guys hashed things out
[8:09:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Preach likes "fly with me" a lot
[8:09:03] ChaoticPriest: he likes healer a lot, but not so much deves @Towelliee
[8:09:06] Rayzodoom: 9/10 he said. 4/10 on the dps
[8:09:07] Meowrawrmoo: he liked the healing spec

[8:09:11] Kale_Nd: he hated the starting zone because of the high cd on soar
[8:09:16] dragothicx: he was saying Evoker felt really slow when you start one at the level they start at.. bad abilities
[8:09:27] MrKhanes: Gamesradar made a article about him
[8:09:39] Ranualf: evoker seems AOE based, but ST they will suffer vs ranged dps(esp in raid) due to their 20-25 yard range limitations... remember shamans had this and Ele sucked
[8:09:42] LearnedSomething: a healer expansion isn't a bad idea
[8:09:52] ThorH13: @ThorH13 It was Great every day i had a group of friend who would run heroics with each other because it needed to be done to help gear and when that came out they decided to do it with randoms because it was a convience time for them
[8:09:54] highlydegen: soar should be a 2.5 min racial
[8:09:57] DeanoTV: need to go to 2.5 CD
[8:10:00] Ranualf: healer expandsion- ROLL DRUID!
[8:10:06] PvtHudson093: Basically we of Preach's chat were taking the piss
[8:10:16] Exxcar: @Towelliee I think Soar should just be the Drakthy's running wild... just let it be a mount form
[8:10:24] pavepawns: just make it 2 min cd. its only useable outside anyways
[8:10:32] Breakthecause: Soar needs to be a 2 min cd
[8:10:38] Rayzodoom: 2 min makes sense
[8:10:39] Exxcar: @pavepawns Why does it even need a CD at all?
[8:10:52] ArcaneMaki: Yes exactly
[8:10:55] PvtHudson093: Mike made it from the Sword in Silithus to Gagetzan
[8:11:02] Exxcar: @Towelliee I mean everyone has access to their own Dragon Mounts?
[8:11:03] Ranualf: seen the draks in SW- Insta kill mechanin at the gate area-the guards say SHOW OFF-walk ilke a normal person-- KEK
[8:11:19] LearnedSomething: 3 minute evoker
[8:11:28] Texas_Mizfit: 4min in azeroth 1min in dragon isle for soar
[8:11:30] illanxiety: Can you guys give me your rating on Evoker on a scale from 1-10? 10 being best
[8:11:34] mohi7o: I think soar should be a "mount", in dragon isles its dragonriding, in normal world its an instant cast normal mount
[8:11:37] kappaday23: Keepo
[8:11:37] ArcaneMaki: 5 minutes is already pretty strong as it is so unique as a navigation tool compared to other classes.
[8:11:40] spiceyholo: just remember Blizz fucking nerfed Glide of Dh. was to good .. no fun is allowed remember that
[8:11:40] looney199725: evoker is ranged dh on crack
[8:11:43] Luxicake: am i hearing slurring? KEKW
[8:11:43] relios898: I think a reduction in the cd and then in the dracthyr starting zone there is no cooldown for it
[8:11:46] Kasvot_Vaxt: is mage on the alpha yet?
[8:11:47] Ranualf: the specs fill them out so you can "spec it out"
[8:11:51] ThorH13: @ThorH13 THEY SHOULD ADD GEAR LOCK OUT TO HEROICS FOR WRATH!!!!
[8:11:53] Gezber: feels like they use more than DH on release
[8:11:56] Exxcar: @Lmag0055 yes, 100%
[8:12:11] ijuki: @ThorH13 Me and my friends helped each other out in heroics to gear us all of our alts, easy and fast (and those emblems too) POGGERS
[8:12:12] Ranualf: also it is Alpha, so any thign can happen
[8:12:16] strike879: @towelliee they could also have an starting zone aura to remove cd kinda like what dk also have in their starting zone
[8:12:32] Nachozdood: easy fix Empower soar while in starting zone and then its back to shit CD while in the open world with the rest of us
[8:12:35] Texas_Mizfit: will evoker be available to play in prepatch
[8:12:40] LearnedSomething: I liked the life grip leap thing
[8:12:41] Ranualf: yea,m DKs had that didnt they Strike
[8:12:42] LearnedSomething: very troll
[8:12:46] RiptoreCA: I forget do they eventually do an OPEN beta for Wrath?
[8:12:57] ijuki: @Texas_Mizfit I believe so yes
[8:13:03] Luxicake: @Texas_Mizfit most likely
[8:13:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: @RiptoreCA they might do a stress test at some point
[8:13:14] ChaoticPriest: I think the DPS evoker is too much like a mage, so I'm personally interested and (probably) will only play the healer spec
[8:13:14] Ranualf: oh, no mount ?
[8:13:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Standing there waiting on a cooldown was awful, yeah
[8:13:31] RiptoreCA: Is the wrath play, Dungeon Spam or Questing?
[8:13:41] Ranualf: yea we know "flying mount suck ass, if you can fly".. just like a druid
[8:13:44] highlydegen: Evoker is just Shaman + Mage
