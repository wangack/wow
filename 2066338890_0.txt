[1:20:18] roarloree: I have a hydrogen powered car.
[1:20:22] realdevv: apple car play is simply a system in the car entertainment system so it connects to your phone and mirrors the actual phone into the car, same apps etc in the car big screen automatically

[1:24:51] Molkohr: dawg
[1:24:58] troxleer: dawg
[1:25:04] realdevv: I was impressed by the 3 pull AD, just 33% of the dungeon trash into each boss

[1:27:00] realdevv: I am one of those mages, i benched that alt indefinitely sticking to melee/tank
[1:27:21] realdevv: Too big dps disparity depending on combust uptime and cd usage
[1:27:38] troxleer: these guys deplete your key fast KEKW
[1:27:46] Frawtarius: I was literally just looking at another guy's "LF" group that he hasn't timed yet KEKW
[1:27:54] roarloree: This mid is not based on bust like it was

[1:30:23] roarloree: What
[1:30:38] realdevv: I'm a terrible person but i try every day to not bring others down just because i'm depressed, bringing happiness to others helps even the small things at work etc.
[1:30:42] Fumomage: lets get physical

[1:33:59] roarloree: You can do 35s with any comp
[1:34:01] bebincalicious: Sounds like Hopeful Susge
[1:34:02] realdevv: @MALBOROM Holy priest is way better healing output than disc, the strength of disc is mainly your dps contribution in higher keys.
[1:34:07] roarloree: 25s
[1:34:08] Molkohr: i've already experienced the echo bench, it's basically official
[1:34:18] MALBOROM: @realdevv And damage absorb no?

[1:39:03] DonVrake: arrange with liquid, call an internal pause
[1:39:09] dhezghia: it seemed like everyone hated sepulcher and that was super long @Scripe
[1:39:21] realdevv: They gotta stop making the first 70-80% of the raid a joke so its hard progress right away
[1:39:27] Fumomage: food buff
[1:39:58] astharoshe4: what was your favorite boss to beat this raid?

[2:22:03] xPegasus: oh, ok, good to know
[2:22:21] realdevv: Its basicly down to the fact that mobs live long enough for ignite to roll and have value

[2:55:42] DonVrake: raiding is kinda complicated
[2:55:57] Eatmeillidan: raid aug is not fun.
[2:56:01] Wreckazoid: raid is complicated. on m+ you are only responsible for buffing 2 dps 1 healer. tank is kinda meh
[2:56:06] kilzogaming: aug raiding has so much minmaxing to do
[2:56:12] gerbsuk: i think the biggest thing is you can really apply your dungeon knowledge to the group and felp out with mechanics
[2:56:19] gerbsuk: help*
[2:56:24] Thuretical: An Aug-focier
[2:56:49] DonVrake: and aug is omega paper so survival is another skill u will need to learn

[8:03:45] tvilk: Dawgs went right at the start, instead of left
[8:03:48] matelener3: wtf is that DK damage
[8:04:23] tvilk: Dawgs had 1 death on tree boss and 1 on witches, both early in the fight so its rough for damage
[8:04:42] tvilk: they ressed on tree
[8:05:01] tvilk: the death on witches happened during the 1st witch
[8:05:37] tvilk: super rough
[8:05:41] Mallaes: jerdRIP for Dawgs
[8:06:09] tvilk: I don't know who I want in the finals.. Last Hope vs Echo would be amazing to watch.. but I also want Echo vs Dawgs for redemption. But then again having Legendary the underdogs win over Echo would be hype as fuck
[8:06:57] tvilk: uhhh
[8:06:59] tvilk: i mean uhh
[8:07:01] Eliannoula: :D
[8:07:04] tvilk: umm

[8:10:33] SmokeyPumkin: ye
[8:11:00] dampen_harm: every stream i go in, ppl talk bad about echo i guess they are forgetting that they are so good that they dont even need BL in 30+ keys

[8:19:33] WillWonkaa: Could you move your cam to below "Last Hope´s" Healing done? So we can see key lvl and affix <3 @Scripe
[8:19:39] tvilk: he died trying to get the bats

[8:24:31] Sklirg: always blaming the healers smh
[8:24:43] Eliannoula: yeah, stuck in queue
[8:24:50] kiirpii: m+ finding when you press i and find group
[8:24:52] tvilk: Sitting 30min trying to find a group for a key and either never get invited or you make your own key and only 2 people sign up
[8:25:07] realdevv: Signing up to other peoples keys is the mistake if you cant get groups, just run your own keyes
[8:25:15] tvilk: told you he doesn't believe it
[8:25:17] svendrabbit: 2 real people is
[8:25:29] realdevv: I get like 20 signs for my own keys or more
[8:25:57] tvilk: I posted my 25 WM last week and had 4 DPS sign up, all of them below 3k rating
[8:26:03] svendrabbit: say i have a 25 key.. getting 2x hunters with only 3k io as the only signups can easiliy happen
[8:26:15] IAmSolari: he didn't invis what
[8:26:32] kalegeneral: I dont understand why he wasnt in prowl
[8:26:35] tvilk: his toxic pot took him out of stealth
[8:26:40] kalegeneral: and got into position
[8:26:44] kalegeneral: yes
[8:26:50] IAmSolari: either in stealth or pulling
[8:26:50] kalegeneral: He was yesterday
[8:26:53] tvilk: toxic pot
[8:26:54] realdevv: @tvilk Must be at degen hours, i ran my own 25 keys and get plenty of 3.4-3.6 people queueing
[8:26:56] tvilk: corrupting rage
[8:27:00] TheCloudkill: toxic health pot
[8:27:04] tvilk: @realdevv 8pm
[8:27:12] TheCloudkill: ticked out of meld
[8:27:19] tvilk: oh that pot
[8:27:40] TheCloudkill: he tried to meld right u can see it on the CDs
[8:28:10] TheCloudkill: toxic health pot ticked him out of meld insta so it didnt work
[8:28:36] tvilk: I swear to god I see so many people fail invis skips because of corrupting rage
[8:28:42] IAmSolari: Dorki is a pretty good tank no?
[8:28:56] tvilk: and then they blame me saying "invis skip wasn't even necessary"
[8:29:20] tvilk: oh dont even get me on that
[8:29:32] tvilk: I had a paladin say he didn't want us to invis a pack, because then he couldn't dps pot on the boss
[8:29:32] IAmSolari: Just wondering if you had an opinion that's all, if you don't it's all cool
[8:29:33] tvilk: on a 24
[8:29:41] Raison2: triple cloth dps meta ?
[8:29:50] IAmSolari: I just don't use corrupting rage pots anymore because of that ticking damage
[8:29:55] Sklirg: @Raison2 loot sharing

[8:32:30] tvilk: 20 seconds alone on deaths, more if you consider routing
[8:32:35] tvilk: but they can catch up
[8:32:38] tvilk: i believe
[8:32:59] tvilk: its all about sanguine management on the goblin room
[8:33:34] IAmSolari: is Andy in MDI this time?
[8:33:39] brandogzz: Are echo out?
[8:34:18] IAmSolari: @tvilk that room on sanguine made me stop tanking for a week
[8:34:24] Eliannoula: @brandogzz no

[8:35:03] LuiBMHunter: Can you full screen it?
[8:36:33] tvilk: we'll see we'll see
[8:38:05] IAmSolari: unless something insane happens on last boss plus divers
[8:38:11] tvilk: We saw Legendary fuck up the boss yesterday with the casts going through
[8:38:20] tvilk: we've seen it happen, could happen again
[8:38:27] tvilk: Last Hope just need to play safe tbh
[8:39:01] tvilk: nono what i mean is they need to not stress
[8:39:11] tvilk: just chill and play normal, dont worry and get io
[8:39:50] IAmSolari: KEKW
[8:40:05] tvilk: you know what i mean you goofball.. some people always like "come gogo quick if you dont pull I pull" sorta mentality
[8:41:08] Raison2: parsing the death KEKW
[8:41:19] IAmSolari: if you get the miniboss to RP range, does sanguine healing on it matter?
[8:41:52] tvilk: once the RP triggers, it triggers
[8:42:00] IAmSolari: ah okay

[8:47:27] Sklirg: Would be interesting if they had to pick a comp for the whole run, maybe even without knowing which dungeons get banned Hmm
