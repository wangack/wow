[1:01:58] Malinkadink: if its a 12th gen intel CPU you may need to disable e-cores in BIOS then COD will work
[1:02:10] Bgarrison1: Maybe just run it on your old PC
[1:02:26] Malinkadink: I have a 12700k i disabled my e cores so its only running 8 performance cores
[1:03:01] Malinkadink: you dont want games to run on e cores so you're not losing performance unless you do production workloads

[1:03:16] Englesyn: most games use 4 cores right?
[1:03:48] Malinkadink: its meant to run background tasks but you're relying on intel and microsoft to program things correctly easier to just not use the e cores lol

[1:08:18] bitlexx: @Englesyn Depends on how the game is developed. As a software developer I do not manage threading. If you need parallel processing, you just create another "Thread" that does things. For games you usually have a game loop (1 Thread) and other threads that does e.g. asset streaming or shader compilation

[1:13:12] bitlexx: @Bgarrison1 I guess so. I think because Win11 does only support a limited number of CPU's, there must be an instruction set, older CPU's do not have, which is used by Windows and which creates the problem.

[3:02:14] kredes_: <3
[3:02:14] freezerburrn: a number typically appearing on shields that sets the amount of damage absorbed when you block an attack. think is what it means swifty
[3:02:44] NafisahParveen: Block Value in general isnt good but was over powered in PVP so that is why it got capped

[3:05:50] greypilgrimz: I feel the classic servers are all dead
[3:06:08] mitchello85: MINT GRAPHICS, GOOD JOB:)
[3:06:09] Alkari0n: im hunt these block value pieces now LUL
[3:06:20] willanwonka: cleared aq40

[3:06:51] demzyes: naxx inc for som

[3:08:25] Zeekio_: scales
[3:08:28] stastnej: wrong
[3:08:28] mitchello85: easy farm
[3:08:46] Ernanz: cuando fue la ultima vez que fuiste a PR?
[3:09:10] NafisahParveen: You can farm rep from the mobs inside but up to revered I think been many years tho
[3:09:11] stastnej: honored is 40 block value ring
[3:09:41] stastnej: tanaris
[3:09:56] Zeekio_: CoT
[3:10:10] NafisahParveen: No its inside the cave
[3:10:11] Zeekio_: Caverns of time
[3:10:15] stastnej: outside
[3:10:19] NafisahParveen: just before the portal
[3:10:20] greypilgrimz: the quartermaster for cot?
[3:10:27] CatarangTWIN: Caverns of Time
[3:11:19] stastnej: its a Quest giver
[3:11:21] NafisahParveen: check atlas loot it tells you
[3:11:48] stastnej: Factions The scale of sands
[3:11:50] NafisahParveen: factions I think
[3:12:11] Bzrk_Ice: It’s an NPC quest giver, pretty sure you won’t have to buy it.
[3:12:28] NafisahParveen: FRIKEN AAAAAY

[3:13:17] BronxBomber__: yea, you just do the quest for that ring and then get rep in hyjal
[3:13:21] stastnej: This is the way
[3:14:00] sephw_: the shield yeah
[3:14:17] NafisahParveen: You can farm the mobs at the start then reset when the boss spawns. You will probably need a group though. You have 2 bosses at the start otherwise you will have to run all the way through Hyjal. The enemies spawn quite far away from the entrance so you can run out when the boss spawns
[3:14:20] Slokil_FR: isn't it for exhalted ? Or am I reading it wrong ?
[3:14:23] Slokil_FR: the ring that is
[3:14:26] NafisahParveen: The mobs will give rep

[3:17:19] mannyesposito: when does WOTLK go live in classic ?

[3:19:39] altxq93: dragonflight classic
[3:20:19] ZioniEu: whens wotlk actually coming out ? does anyone know
[3:20:51] Oorgnid: I hope that they do something similar to cross realm to help with faction balance for wotlk.  That would be nice IMO
[3:21:13] coastalhappiness: It will come out in September most likely
[3:21:26] ZioniEu: tyvm beth
[3:21:39] Oorgnid: Yeah, but, there are servers that are dominated by horde / alliance
[3:21:42] Alkari0n: i feel like classic is played more than retail now a days
[3:21:54] capt1n_bubblez1: get cross realm outta here bro bad enough we have cross realm bg's THIS IS CLASSIC
[3:22:00] coastalhappiness: They are making fresh servers oorgnid
[3:22:02] greypilgrimz: @Alkari0n what is retail? =P
[3:22:06] KJMcKay7: Human racial is the big issue, every streamer is concerned
[3:22:32] coastalhappiness: Shadow priest is ganna be so much fun in wrath
[3:22:36] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[3:22:46] Steelers067: yooo Swifty wat up
[3:22:52] suhdude90: i wish they would nerf human racial tbh
[3:22:56] Oorgnid: @bethshebax Yeah, i saw that's one way to try and "help" with it.  But, gotta do something else, otherwise it's going to just be the same result.  Benediction was like 90% alliance before I quit TBC classic, dunno if it still is.

[3:23:45] coastalhappiness: I wanna see swifty try shadow priest in wrath
[3:24:00] Zeekio_: nightbane
[3:24:02] Zeekio_: chest
[3:24:11] Thomusus: SWIFTY VS the TROLLS we already know who'll win this fight
[3:24:17] Thomusus: :D Aka Zul Aman :)
[3:24:18] KJMcKay7: Asmongold doesn’t think they’ll do a cata classic. They have other ideas after Wotlk
[3:24:40] coastalhappiness: They will do cata I guarantee it
[3:24:40] greypilgrimz: Asmongold does not know
[3:24:44] drummond777: didnt they already say they were

[3:25:32] chin184: do we get classic plus you think?
[3:25:34] fefefen: NEVER go past wrath
[3:25:35] KJMcKay7: They might just add new content to the existing class world. Nobody wants cata
[3:25:36] kirbz09: just the pvp
[3:25:37] redvirusbg: wotlk forever. man
[3:25:37] mrblond5: ill stay in WOTLK
[3:25:38] darhez: I hope they keep all classic expansions tho
[3:25:39] yourstalker183: i enjoyed cata, was fun and great pvp
[3:25:39] imoxyr6: Nope
[3:25:42] Thomusus: I want them to stop and do the greatest retail
[3:25:43] KJMcKay7: Classic world*
[3:25:44] greypilgrimz: I want to stop after Mop
[3:25:50] dustysubaru: everyones opinion will change after two years of woltk
[3:25:50] suhdude90: we will all be 62 and have crippling arthritis by the time cata comes out anyways
[3:25:53] Pufendorf99: want Cata as well, it needs a second chanche
[3:25:57] kimjongcouille: they will do cata because money money
[3:25:59] RemoQT: Cata with wotlk talents would be cool
[3:26:01] chin184: swifty do you think wotlk or classix plus?
[3:26:07] Thomusus: I say stop and focus on Retail :D
[3:26:07] imoxyr6: Wrath 2 kekw
[3:26:09] naruumskie: wrath will be fun until icc when all melees get deathbringers will and shadowmourne
[3:26:10] yarmoli: TBH classic should have stayed classic
[3:26:11] Ruxthas: Without gdkp maybe
[3:26:12] greypilgrimz: easy money
[3:26:13] drummond777: yeah im cool with all expansions stopping at mop
[3:26:20] will_i_am901: @RemoQT true
[3:26:25] KJMcKay7: Stop haha
[3:26:27] fefefen: mop kappa
[3:26:29] fefefen: no please
[3:26:33] greypilgrimz: MOP
[3:26:36] Zeekio_: mop
[3:26:37] Zeekio_: lol
[3:26:39] suhdude90: panda and then legion
[3:26:40] dustysubaru: mop
[3:26:44] Slokil_FR: I always wondered how you guys get some much gold. I remember playing classic (60) and struggling to get 100g +
[3:26:50] dustysubaru: then wod
[3:26:52] dustysubaru: then legion
[3:27:02] mrblond5: WOD
[3:27:03] Ruxthas: Mopaclysm
[3:27:09] Alkari0n: what if they end up adding new things to the wrath , like new bosses and stuff, kinda like a new game xD , thatd be cool
[3:27:11] suhdude90: mop pvp was the best, watching reckful during mop was the best thing ever :(
[3:27:14] Meriadock_CR: MoP, WoD, and legion haha
[3:27:15] Oorgnid: WoD wa sgross.  That whole garrison thing.  no thxc
[3:27:17] kimjongcouille: legion was really good to me
[3:27:20] drummond777: pls no wod
[3:27:22] greypilgrimz: I quit playing on WOD
[3:27:22] yarmoli: peanut knew that wher is he at
[3:27:25] fefefen: cata classic skip mop straight to wod classic
[3:27:26] mrblond5: after WOLK  i would play only legion
[3:27:30] imoxyr6: Blizzard buy spellbreak devs to help developing wow
[3:27:33] TrickDunn: Even though blizz nerfed' warrior's ability to convert Windfuries into Heroic Strikes-- you can still convert Sword Procs into Heroic Strikes or even Cleaves, which is pretty legit for 2h Slam PvE Arms.  If ya catch a sword it's something to keep in mind to avoid rage capping! GL on Jinrohk if your goin for it!
[3:27:37] fefefen: history can be fixed
[3:27:37] cupraak: WOD was great for pvp just pvp
[3:27:39] mrblond5: WOTLK*
[3:27:43] fefefen: pandaria doesnt need to exist
[3:27:46] Sando_tK: Yeah ... we can skip the broken macro u share in cata
[3:27:53] NafisahParveen: I like cata tbh. Nothin liek Wrath but The biggest issue was the talent change, the linear zones and story, complete removal of old classic zones and the jeapody of prio expansions. We started doing 120k Crits in ICC at level 85 in blues. The power gap from WoTLK to Cata was FAR too high despite the Cata content being somewhat fun and challenging
[3:27:55] KJMcKay7: Y’all have been settling for less man
[3:27:58] Ruxthas: yeah Wod was my stop too since then iam on an wotlk Privateserver
[3:27:59] Thomusus: Yeah, I think this also means you watched BLACK SAILS right?

[3:29:58] imoxyr6: I missed warcraft 2 naval battle
[3:30:03] greypilgrimz: Would you play WoW in VR?
[3:30:15] bitlexx: @Steelers067 Freudian slip? :)
[3:30:25] Alkari0n: i would get dizzy xD
[3:30:26] Oorgnid: He has before.  I rmemeber watching you pvp outside of SW with your vr set
[3:30:30] rei__03: vr is just not it
[3:30:35] mrblond5: idk the only expansion i stopped  playing was  shadowlands  the rest of them after wotlk were ok ... i really enjoyed legion

[3:49:04] TrickDunn: LPT: you should always macro "/startattack" to your slam macro-- to ensure you always white hit before you slam when engaging initially

[3:49:19] TrickDunn: yea when you're rage capped, back to back slams can be nutty!
[3:49:35] TrickDunn: 0.5 second cast via talents is legit, it's the way for PvE
[3:49:44] Sando_tK: CoolStoryBob
[3:50:13] TrickDunn: 33/28/0 with 3 points in fury is really fun in PvE tbh, LOTSA slammin
[3:50:26] TrickDunn: i do swap to 2x 1.4 weapon speed swords for execute phase though, spammin it
[3:50:38] TrickDunn: oh it has no place in pvp tbh
[3:51:06] JokiGhostCrew: How much worse is NE Warrior compared to Human Warrior when looking at racials?
[3:51:09] widepeeposad__: I think u slam in cata pvp

[3:53:59] Alkari0n: i used rend alot as an arm warrior in wrath , specially against rouges
[3:54:19] baraktus: how long u staying today swifty
[3:54:53] Lifestream7: I dont do Kara anymore way too long
[3:54:55] TrickDunn: couple niche things about arms pve in TBC: You can convert sword procs into Cleaves or Heroic Strikes. You can also cast Sweeping Strikes at the very end of a Slam cast, and your Slam will be included in the Sweeping Strikes (nice to ensure you get full value of SS when using a 2H)

[3:55:45] ZeroKelviin: That was some insane damage you were pumping
[3:56:54] Lifestream7: The only reason  i would ever do Kara would be a GDKP for gold but not worth the amount of time those take unless im super bored with nothing to do
[3:57:46] vanaria1018: in the grass by the steps you can mount early .. for future running

[4:16:01] mbb91: working with your hands and all
[4:16:13] BeardedAnarchist: I'm renovating my moms house atm and If I dont know how to do soemthing I just watch youtube and subcontract anything thats not possible to do myself.

[4:21:00] Oorgnid: @iamhugepapi I mean, if you can gain a lot of viewers and 1k subs, you could
[4:21:03] Oorgnid: Easier said than done
[4:21:13] Lifestream7: @iamhugepapi No audience = no income and you will start with  0 viewers unless you are known from a different platform like youtube or something
[4:21:45] Oorgnid: Problem people don't understand is followers don't mean anything, it's the viewer count.
[4:21:50] mbb91: I would stream casually don't try and go full time from the start
[4:21:50] makeo: still skating swifty?
[4:22:16] Oorgnid: You could have 1000 followers, if no one is watching, then it's kind of a wash

[4:23:22] Galdrena: and don't go in other streams promoting yourself. that will get you banned unless you have the streamers permission
[4:23:55] silent_storm_45: and if all 1000 are subscribers and not watching,its still a profit
[4:24:02] Oorgnid: @iamhugepapi That also depends on your viewers.  If those 100 viewers are subbing/gifting/donating, then yeah
