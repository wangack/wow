[8:35:28] copycatish: wait what
[8:35:30] julialasu: eh?
[8:35:40] Minxy_Ann: @msgmag how is this wrong??? every person is free to do and choose as they want
[8:35:45] Lindberq: love how touching this talk went <3
[8:35:48] MistahClaun: @msgmag it is not. living for the sake of what your family or anyone thinks will only cause pain
[8:36:19] Lindberq: much love to ya tho!
[8:36:25] Lindberq: keep it going!
[8:36:44] Sofiiezz: how is it wrong
[8:36:48] Eradicationyo: don't make assumptions about what we want for her lol
[8:36:50] julialasu: wait wtf what
[8:36:53] Sofiiezz: pls tell me
[8:36:53] copycatish: the way she WANTS to go is not the wrong way
[8:36:56] vvndrei: is that melan spanito?
[8:36:59] MistahClaun: @msgmag wrong way. mwahuaha. some people just think they know "the right" way
[8:37:01] yellowhaddock1: you have to be your own person and what makes you happy even if it means family friends disagree with them
[8:37:02] Annagoeslive: @msgmag there is no wrong way
[8:37:28] Minxy_Ann: @msgmag BRO meet me out back we about to throw some hands, and trust me you wont win this
[8:37:36] Annagoeslive: what is the right way? its different for each one of us @msgmag
[8:37:47] Eradicationyo: more people should live the life that they want. there's enough fake people already
[8:37:51] Berrasw3: dont think he himself knows what he is talking about
[8:38:01] copycatish: trying to make others feel bad about their choices when they're not hurting anyone is not the way bro. How about u live your life and we all live our lives
[8:38:10] MistahClaun: thing is living for the sake of others is a socially construct aspiration, if you need approval that much to hinder our own life and decisions, it will always hurt
[8:38:16] Sofiiezz: @msgmag no but pls I wanna hear why youy think that :) like pls tell me
[8:38:18] julialasu: Living the life she wants is not wrong and  live your life as you want like dont get in pepole buissnes
[8:38:19] Lindberq: well there are wrong ways but i dont see a wrong way in her way to happiness
[8:38:23] MistahClaun: and it is a social disease, not "a choice"
[8:38:31] riphenrik: Have you made any changes recently? i dont get it (just came back). do they not approve of streaming? who tf cares. i followed to path of my parents whishes. work in an office 10hrs (somtimes more) every day. money is good, but my head is not

[8:44:14] asdasdasdasdasdasdasdads: imagine having a daughter
[8:44:23] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[8:44:27] Rkdoom: Feels like a healthy view, I wouldnt do it either but I could not care less if others make spicy content, good for them
[8:44:36] Zimmac: xD
[8:45:05] demonzhunter: i might do it haha if someone would pay for it
[8:45:06] demonzhunter: lool
[8:45:14] demonzhunter: sadly
[8:45:23] StreamElements: My current playlist is: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5yfpG2DjHPthKZwAbD8tYE
[8:45:53] Nooke_eu: i'm here for the music, not spicy content. deal with it!
[8:46:05] Minxy_Ann: There is only a couple things I will call people out on with their decisions but those decisions would be them doing something super bad to end up in prison, otherwise let people do what they want, no reason to bash them or call them out on it...simple mind ur business and others mind them
[8:46:52] riphenrik: Did u expect your parents to reacts good to it? dont have anything against you, but imagine have a daughter that came to you with these "news". its soley for money, and you just sat the bar. no offense
[8:46:53] StreamElements: Get Exclusive NordVPN deal here ➼ https://nordvpn.com/snowmixy It’s risk-free with Nord’s 30-day money-back guarantee!
[8:47:13] Stricken79: I think there are a lot of people here in their 20s, you may even be in your 30s, but you don't know anything yet. That's what I see talking to alot of my younger friends. I've been through all the shit they are going through and seen it before but they need to make that mistake as they are old enough to argue with someone. You'll know when you get older about your life and on one can convince you when you are young to not make the mistakes you need to
[8:48:42] Minxy_Ann: @riphenrik If that is what she wants to do then that is her decision...that is the same thing as a kid of yours coming out as gay/lesbian or something, and as a parent you would still want to love and support your kid you may not see things the same way as them but u will still respect ur kid because its ur kid at the end of the day
[8:49:19] TheFernandeez: 100%
[8:49:20] Zimmac: its the same with politics people are ending long friendships depending on what you are voting for.
[8:49:23] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[8:49:28] riphenrik: @Minxy_Ann With all due respect, but are u srly comparing comming out with making spicy content?
[8:49:30] Rkdoom: There is still a fair bit of stigma around spicy content in general, I think you have to partially expect people to not be on board with someone close to do that, unfortunately
[8:50:05] Minxy_Ann: @riphenrik because you are talking about a kid coming out about something that some people consider serious, it is the same thing of just respecting what your kids want to do with their lives
[8:50:13] demonzhunter: the sad thing is that someones view on spicy content is most likely a reflection of their own self esteem
[8:50:23] StreamElements: My current playlist is: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5yfpG2DjHPthKZwAbD8tYE
[8:50:29] demonzhunter: obviously its more complex than that but you get the point
[8:50:50] ettaj90: as a dude id do it without second tthought but i think its all on personal opinions
[8:50:54] Eradicationyo: i'd be worried if it didnt bother you at all
[8:51:00] Rkdoom: yes ofcourse that wasnt my point ^^
[8:51:42] ShyMew: if your values do not align with a streamer, dont watch them. No need to announce departure imo
[8:52:25] riphenrik: @Minxy_Ann  I think we have two really different opinions, and i am standing on my point that u cant compare. Sexual preference and selling pictures of your body is two entierly different things.
[8:52:33] demonzhunter: yeah
[8:52:37] Eradicationyo: that's awful
[8:52:40] demonzhunter: silly thing to do
[8:53:07] Minxy_Ann: @riphenrik its not about respecting the act that they are doing its about just respecting the person and not what they do...its just simple but u think what u want bud and just drop it
[8:53:22] Eradicationyo: makes me wonder what he tried to achieve then, a shock effect so that you'd stop or something? idno
[8:53:52] demonzhunter: whatever it is its definitely their issue
[8:53:55] Nooke_eu: @Eradicationyo nothing to achieve, men are simple.
[8:53:58] demonzhunter: you can only do so much to help sometimes
[8:54:20] ogkushen: @Snowmixy Is your friend a social person? (Maybe this friend need to think of whats best for him)
[8:54:23] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[8:54:29] riphenrik: @Minxy_Ann Hey haha, u @ me?
[8:54:38] Eradicationyo: you take that back nooke, im not simple im an idiot LUL
[8:55:09] asdasdasdasdasdasdasdads: people end marriages for the silliest reasons nowadays. relationships are not that meaningful
[8:55:23] StreamElements: My current playlist is: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5yfpG2DjHPthKZwAbD8tYE
[8:55:37] Elias_New17: he just wanted to let you know, because you were friends he just didnt want to ghost you
[8:55:47] Eradicationyo: more that it's easier to go and find someone / something else then it is to try and "fix" whatever is wrong in the relationship or marriage
[8:55:58] klxlxlx: you know what mixy
[8:56:03] epicpockettroll: a lot get married only to divorce, evil minds are everywhere
[8:56:05] buxenus_: @asdasdasdasdasdasdasdads yepp, people give up instantly and don't want to work on their relationship nowdays. I speak from experience
[8:56:06] klxlxlx: im gonne be your friend
[8:56:09] klxlxlx: dont worry
[8:56:15] ShyMew: if you dont like a streamer, dont watch
[8:56:21] ogkushen: Yes like a influencer, he need to protect his brand then, if he can't be connected with creator that work with that kind content

[8:57:24] demonzhunter: yeah
[8:57:25] Eradicationyo: well.. he gave up on the relationship by talking to others
[8:57:32] demonzhunter: thats fair enough
[8:57:38] snusdosan7: So much to work on when somebody is cheating xD
[8:57:39] demonzhunter: probably for the best
[8:57:46] miserabilis: do you wish to be in a relationship?
[8:58:11] Eradicationyo: no man that is serious about their relationship or marriage would ever pull something like that

[8:59:23] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[8:59:36] demonzhunter: views on stuff like that do change tho
[8:59:38] Nooke_eu: you haven't met me yet - probably the reason you are not wishing for a relationship
[8:59:39] demonzhunter: as you get older

[9:00:38] mutryzqt: leav it for 5 mion and its of talk and now its tinder
[9:00:40] miserabilis: there is a lot of perks with being in a relationship, but there definitely are drawbacks and tradeoffs. for instance, less gaming in a relationship
[9:00:43] Berrasw3: ppl seem to think that twitch is tinder KEKW

[9:02:02] Nooke_eu: still searching for the swipe button
[9:02:06] miserabilis: what do you see as the #1 / #2 perks of being in a relationship?
