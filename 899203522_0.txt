[1:34:07] WhiteKnight74648: think its because it gives you 20 styigia
[1:34:50] Antdavs24: no it makes sense, its a PR move as well as a competitive move

[1:35:16] Fluaxx: It is boring.
[1:35:18] pavepawns: also i dunno how others would feel but i personally find raid leading Castle nathria more stressful then the BFA raids
[1:35:19] t0mtom: i know it might be strange to ask someone who plays everyday, but is it worth coming back to wow?
[1:35:44] Todmeister9000: Towelliee, are you gonna play with Sloot?

[1:44:55] alextheory_: i feel it always as been the case
[1:45:10] DallTV_: he did a vid on hes yt
[1:45:14] Crowzcut: i was watching quin stream last night people are nuts there
[1:45:14] TheUnknowing: cause the game isn't in the greatest state and the stress of raiding at that level is too much @fum_in
[1:45:53] Jarlan23: loots been fine for me. ppl forget that theyd still have titanforging if we didnt have current loot system
[1:46:09] Vigi9413: simple solution is don't be in a top 100 guild
[1:46:18] Vigi9413: and enjoy your time
[1:46:55] TheUnknowing: That actually isn't true @Jarlan23 they went a bit too far with cutting down the loot this expac tbh
[1:47:08] TompsonX: 3 250 anima quests in EU in Maldraxxus!
[1:47:18] Jarlan23: its only 1 less item per m+
[1:47:19] falldrgn: looking at sloots twitter announcement. I feel like the community as a whole is happy for him

[1:48:22] alextheory_: on his youtube video he said he doesnt want to
[1:48:24] Vigi9413: Echo is strong who could he knock
[1:48:45] surrendermonkee: he doesnt want to...it was a more social Mythic guild he was into with older guys that had the family etc....
[1:48:46] Vigi9413: Preach to Shade confirmed Kappa
[1:48:59] Armdel: He dropped a video last night on youtube where he talks about the whole thing

[2:03:13] Vigi9413: @lazugo i can get behind that
[2:03:16] Antdavs24: how about the fact that theyre working from home still lol
[2:03:22] Riggoz1: We dont make enough money - Bobby
[2:03:37] Korupcija_: you're underestimating loot box addiction!
[2:03:44] WoW_StandalonE: stop that working from home card
[2:03:54] WoW_StandalonE: its is not valid anymore
[2:04:05] Velashen: They haven't looked "strong" in the lineup for a while. Several IPs have gathered dust for a long time.
[2:04:07] naughtillus: Idk, I feel like if they say that the pandemic is affecting their timeline that would be more understandable than just radio silence...
[2:04:18] Vigi9413: do you think if they postponed the release longer they could've fixed some stuff?
[2:04:19] alextheory_: why not? everyone know anyway! Look at new world! They switch to WFH and they aknowledge it
[2:04:19] WoW_StandalonE: if u cant manage working from home by now, u are a dead business
[2:04:33] akia03: isnt there a quest version of that backpack
[2:05:24] Antdavs24: theres a massive thing working from home and being productive from home lol
[2:05:27] Megadisaster24: @Mallaes Both, as in What is in the Covenant will be the same come 9.2, Raids are also feeling kinda like WoD, where a lot of people aren't even trying to clear it. The only difference is that SL has M+, which WoD didn;t have, although Challenge Dungeons were there, they are nothing compared to M+
[2:05:31] falldrgn: I feel bad because while I have been working from home.. alot of my co workers have not been able too
[2:05:37] WhiteKnight74648: I still dont understand how the MC bug in arena is still a thing
[2:06:30] Thoreya: i also do think tho the players exaggerate the fuck bout everything
[2:06:31] Thoreya: lol
[2:06:40] Antdavs24: @Thoreya also true LUL
[2:06:43] Semppro: Hi, have you done lfr

[2:06:59] Zivs: They are slow on balance changes even without WFH tho?
[2:07:05] Zivs: always has been
[2:07:13] Gerr_x: fury has got like a 20% buff since launch, and is still basically last
[2:07:18] Gerr_x: out side of dungeon cleave
[2:07:25] Riggoz1: I agree, some specs are still so low that 7 weeks into the game they are already so far behind
[2:07:41] Quillix84: poor asmongold
[2:07:45] hildobagins: um BM hunter.....
[2:07:57] PadidinJones: Im annoyed because I want to level a warrior but its like the worst DPS class atm
[2:08:05] Masqerader: they also aoe capped and shit still falls over from massive pulls lol
[2:08:07] stjon13: fury has good cleave in M+
[2:08:13] Masqerader: halls
[2:08:32] KingsandClubs: In heroic i was top dps on inerva and sunking with fury and i mainly top charts in M+
[2:08:49] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: bm hunter was broken because of azerite more or less
[2:08:52] MOLAR305: I leveled my warrior and am just playing him for fun, I'm no bahjeera, but I'm also not trying to mythic raid with it

[2:09:06] yunggluten: its 17 to 28% behind depending on fight
[2:09:07] indiana__cones: BM isn't scaling well right now
[2:09:11] S_CoR: can we delete survival hunter? it's basically the same
[2:09:11] akia03: 15-20% about thar between bm and mm
[2:09:14] maroram1: let MM shine for once
[2:09:17] WoW_StandalonE: BM is afk spec so it should be behind MM
[2:09:19] Thoriakk: I would really like to be play my DK in Frost BIT I have to play UH for meta
[2:09:19] teydam_2020: my partner has always stay Mm and is happy now lol
[2:09:25] magemaster225: surv crying in a corner
[2:09:31] Kinghorn: whats a surv
[2:09:39] Kinghorn: cobaltSmug
[2:09:41] akia03: mm is already dropping fast
[2:09:44] PadidinJones: When will survival have their moment??
[2:09:54] jasperboy: MM was better in Legion
[2:09:59] flyingmachin3: give bm a patch to catch up with more stats
[2:10:00] ayrennasky: I'm BM, have nothing against MM but they really need to nerf those rapid fire one shot things, it's a curse in pvp
[2:10:01] Kinghorn: I am the captain now
[2:10:02] idenkaz_: i think blizz gave up on survival.
[2:10:08] MOLAR305: survival is the new ferlul
[2:10:14] Masqerader: marksman was so much fun in WOD before the Legion patch
[2:10:16] Gerr_x: survival is pvp viable
[2:10:17] falldrgn: They had their moments.. in WOTLK after the Arp nerf
[2:10:23] indiana__cones: could be worse, could be frost mage
[2:10:30] miroc228: i am capped on soul ash what do i do
[2:10:31] HankHedjman: survival had there moment in Karazhan. That was it. That long ago.
[2:10:32] Korupcija_: MoP survival hunter Kreygasm
[2:10:40] MOLAR305: WoD MM was soooo much fun
[2:10:41] LordKain73: the only hunter spec that takes skill to play is survival.
[2:10:47] Kinghorn: cobaltHMM
[2:10:48] Crowzcut: lol haha
[2:10:58] Valdur359: @Towelliee what lego do you use for prot pvp?
[2:10:59] Kinghorn: or just stop doing torghast
[2:11:01] miroc228: i already have my bis
[2:11:04] yunggluten: MM is def better than SV in arena right now
[2:11:09] dcorey416: how much soul ash for max ilvl leggo?
[2:11:18] rebound_ttv: 5150
[2:11:20] Sollice: 3250 is fresh i believe
[2:11:27] Sollice: Oh its 5150?
[2:11:32] dcorey416: thnx
[2:11:39] s4boi: the issue with survival is that it doesnt have cap on AoE and two leggos are boosting that AoE further. They can do ST buffs, which surv needs, but guess blizz is lazy so they buffs surv by the few drops
[2:11:40] Crowzcut: upgrade
[2:11:40] rebound_ttv: for max rank? Rank 4? yeah.
[2:11:44] Wulfgrym: yeah its funny

[2:17:51] Guillin: Esports players normally use the tournament realms so surely a separate client without the changes would be possible for them
[2:17:53] holst23: Just use a older version on the tournament servers? like they do in league of legends?
[2:18:07] Thoreya: xaryu was on the front page of twitch last night and got like 35k viewers fucking crazy
[2:19:06] PokerFaceMoose: overwatch league would play on servers that had old patches on them to make it fair for them
[2:19:33] ayrennasky: first is competition, then is blizzcon... I'm already not subscribing after this 10d I still have, more than sure about it
[2:20:18] skruffie_: Like sc2 would make a change but it wouldnt affect the tournaments until the following week. Could work.
[2:20:18] Sincline387: worlds first is different, it's like 2 weeks tops....the tourneys though last forever
[2:20:19] aikopooh: yep yep they lost me already lolz
[2:20:24] Amarlian: They could even change it to a policy to not nerf the tanks being used but buff the ones that aren't
[2:20:27] raldrik: Being the best in competitions is about being able to adapt to changes.

[2:22:17] jasperboy: I miss SOO
[2:22:36] shagbark_: I liked the Oden fight
[2:22:36] thebakeriscomingforu: raid tiers are not really a thing anymore. Tier gear is gone. So its all just raids now
[2:22:43] MOLAR305: ony?
[2:22:46] mrpresbaby: I liked that raid
[2:22:51] NVbrutal: should just change it to if 150 guilds total kill 10/10 they make raid cross realm for Mythic
[2:22:52] Masqerader: malygos/sarth?
[2:22:57] Masqerader: ony
[2:23:00] Zettabyte: towOny
[2:23:03] falldrgn: It was a raid.. but not a raid tier, I think it was an extra raid like Ruby Sanctum..
[2:23:12] Dylan19_93: just indoor world bosses :P
[2:23:14] Shotcue21: if its a 10m+ its a raid there for a WF reachable content
[2:23:16] Pacostrano: Oni was a world boss :P
[2:23:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: by that logic WoD wasn't an expansion Kappa

[2:24:50] StahliZero: I wanna play female draenei and male tauren :D and with same ppl
[2:24:51] Masqerader: Mary Poppins style
[2:24:52] Anathdra: crucible was only for 8-10 weeks, not really comparable. thats why it opened early for crossrealm
[2:24:55] akia03: what are you upgrading now after the 2 t3 sanctum upgrades?
[2:25:04] NVbrutal: will be 150 guilds down the raid in a week or so, think like 80 are 10/10 and like 145 are atleast 9/10 should just open it up already lol
[2:25:24] othraerir: 15 ally at 9/10, 10 cleared mythic
[2:25:25] Wulfgrym: water is a liquid, WRONG!!!
[2:25:29] propoopimus: nah, but it's fine to disagree lol
[2:25:35] Gerr_x: it would be called a .5 tier, like AQ was considered 2.5 for example. still counts as a tier, just... smaller
[2:25:40] Sollice: They may have to change 100/100 to 50/50. Even a 50/50 STILL wouldnt be unlocked yet though
[2:25:54] Masqerader: Towelliee making that kid leaks tears about tiers
[2:25:57] Crowzcut: lol
[2:26:02] propoopimus: ill determine when i want to stop talking ty
[2:26:03] thebakeriscomingforu: Again: Tiers of raiding aligned with Tier sets. When tier sets went away so did the idea of raid tiers. people still use the term though..
[2:26:09] Kinghorn: alliance*
[2:26:12] Crowzcut: im crying i cant play wow
[2:26:18] thebakeriscomingforu: raids are just raids

[2:28:21] thebakeriscomingforu: nah, people would just unsub
[2:28:23] WhiteKnight74648: It should be that way in pvp too Kappa
[2:28:24] Masqerader: Blizzard gonna add determination in mythic for alliance

[2:28:44] NVbrutal: that wouldnt change anything people would just xfer to alliance then lol
[2:28:50] Thoreya: ion hinted at possibly doing cross faction stuff in a recent interview for forbes i think"?
[2:28:50] Amarlian: FYI it's Guldan today for the nightfae @Towelliee
[2:28:54] Thoreya: some website
[2:28:56] Clicklesly: I feel like they can't do that mid-expansion though ^^
[2:28:57] Masqerader: no on is around on vault day
[2:29:03] Masqerader: that will be my sign
[2:29:06] eternaldamante: why not a free for all bg?
[2:29:10] MOLAR305: I find it stupid that we can't chat with alliance since we can talk to their leaders
[2:29:12] PokerFaceMoose: i mean horde can do mercenary mode, so they already pvp together
[2:29:18] idholypoo: idholypoo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 3 month streak! thanks for the continued great content. keep it up
[2:29:27] Masqerader: Ion is also anti spock, he is illogical
[2:29:33] Antdavs24: its ok in 10 years we'll finally be able to play AoC and alliance wont even matter Kappa
[2:29:48] idenkaz_: crossfaction content needs to happen sooner or later.

[2:30:22] ice_cream_dog: Kappa
[2:30:24] MrClaudeSeaburn: @Towelliee sorry who are you talking about
[2:30:28] MOLAR305: he has to weigh making money(prolonging subs) and being a designer
[2:30:31] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: no crossfaction is bullshit now
[2:30:54] Antdavs24: @Antdavs24 towLewd
[2:30:58] Gerr_x: why is now different from when the game is dying? what is the downside to cross faction raiding?
[2:31:17] BestoftheWurst: FOR THE HORDE!
[2:31:26] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: some ppl have problems. I dont care about it. I want alliance to be more populated thats all
[2:31:30] Sollice: I really think if they are talking about going cosmic with next xpac, thats when everyone should be merged. We are going to outerspace we should all be fighting together to kill that cosmic thing
[2:31:30] Maydie6066: if i joined a raid with ally i would crash that raid and leave lol
[2:31:32] idenkaz_: well i dont see anything good in alliiance dying and im horde. it would hurt the game more than people think.
[2:31:48] MOLAR305: cross faction raiding after closing hall of fame lol
[2:31:49] byrdeen45: Already cross faction in pvp where you can use Q with other faction
[2:31:49] sarcilav: like people on KJ swapping to Goblin, would be the norm
[2:31:59] warrenny: M+ would be nelf only
[2:32:03] Jindo_ZG: A lot of friends who started playing for the first time have insane faction pride for some reason even though they hardly know any of the lore if at all
[2:32:10] PadidinJones: The only cross faction ive seen that was good was the legion scenario on the broken shore.
[2:32:20] TheUnknowing: it would just give people the option to play whatever they want, alot of people only play horde for raiding
[2:32:32] Gerr_x: cross faction would basically allow people to play alliance if they wanted to
[2:32:39] PadidinJones: Those baggies turned out great yo!
[2:32:41] Gerr_x: right now you are forced to play horde if you want any high end pve content
[2:32:43] idenkaz_: crossfaction pvp lmao. we need crossfaction pve where the actual playerbase resides.
[2:32:44] Masqerader: Faction Pride, that thing people only acknowledged at Blizzcon when Metzen yelled "where my horde at"
[2:32:49] PadidinJones: Ewww ember court
[2:32:54] average_j4y: @Towelliee cross faction and picking which faction you want to play
[2:32:57] Sollice: I cant wait until Illidan comes back nexy xpac and they release DH to all races like they did with DK
[2:32:57] MOLAR305: I unlocked ember court, but haven't even finished finished starter quest
[2:33:14] akia03: doing mission table upgrade now @Towelliee
[2:33:18] Pacostrano: the transmog are too expensive
[2:33:19] Drmmrtnt: @Towelliee I have done the intro questline for the court but have not returned since lol
[2:33:20] TheUnknowing: ima be a tauren dh @Sollice Kappa
[2:33:26] KingsandClubs: Ni you wont be the only one haven’t touched that shit
[2:33:27] Sollice: lol
[2:33:31] StahliZero: @Sollice imagine mechagnome DH
[2:33:39] Sollice: Could you imagine a raid full of Tauren DH fel rushing everywhere
[2:33:43] Just_Wargus: Still haven't even touched ember court
[2:33:46] Redpandalol: @towelliee it’s probably going to be like dazaralor. You keep your faction but when you zone you switch to whatever the raid leader is.
[2:33:50] manmower: horde has strongest covenants, makes it unbalanced
[2:33:50] Gerr_x: its nothing to do with mythic raiding imo, just look at raw numbers
[2:33:51] Masqerader: they need to make Anima it scale with key level like echoes did in BFA
[2:33:57] average_j4y: I want to play a Horde Dwarf Druid. Make it happen
[2:34:07] Sollice: @manmower WHat?
[2:34:11] Nehcrom: Yeah me too I have as many max lvl horde as ally :P
[2:34:16] Uutef: I don't believe that
[2:34:23] MOLAR305: undead pally pls
[2:34:26] StahliZero: why did you transfer from ally Towellie? Was it worth it?
[2:34:32] Korupcija_: then look in group finder on alliance and horde and say the same
[2:34:36] Nehcrom: Undead pally would be awesome!
[2:34:40] porowozek: what about rogue tarens?
[2:34:56] ThreeBeeps: they will create one major enemy that the horde and alliance have to "team up" to defeat. kind of like AQ but moreso

[2:35:22] TheUnknowing: I mean its not like people arent playing alliance, it just when it comes to high end end game content no one plays alliance
[2:35:31] MOLAR305: if I'm a human pally and I get turned into an undead, why can't I be a pally if I can be a priest

[4:20:06] toobaked1987: GME just hired Amazon executive to take over ecommerce
[4:20:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Towelliee did you see that 300 gamestop parody animation
[4:20:08] KingSlayerYotam: prob not but he should have
[4:20:17] EnragedSushi: yeah you should DEF not be holding onto that stock lol

[4:20:22] jiffynuts: Hold the door
[4:20:22] Thoreya: bezos resigned yesterday
[4:20:30] TawdBall: time to buy some puts on gme. I think WSB is getting bored and on to other things
[4:21:00] Kayfes: some of you all have no idea what you're doing in the stock market and I love that cause I just dump shares on the noobs
[4:21:05] Sollice: Ehh Bezos is moving to a consulting role so he can focus on Blue Origin and other iniatives. If you think he is still not in control your nuts lol
[4:21:15] Mecabeast: we have 3mos till next quarter so I suspect a handful will spike up in 2 mos

[4:21:46] Sollice: Who would even buy GME at 420 though? I mean who kind of tard would think its going to be worth more than that for much longer?
[4:21:46] Roffasauras: He's doing a Bills Gate
[4:21:55] Galloglas_Kilt: He's still gonna be in charge, just not as CEO lol
[4:21:57] Kayfes: he made it finally
[4:22:02] HankHedjman: he's moving up the chain. he's going to become executive chairman, the CEO reports to him now.
[4:22:06] Armdel: wanted some more free time to spend those billions
[4:22:08] sturgeon_general: whats best leggo for brewmaster?
[4:22:11] EnragedSushi: Not how that works lol
[4:22:14] HankHedjman: and he's focusing on Amazon Spece INC
[4:22:20] Lego17: hes moving to board of directors
[4:22:23] KingSlayerYotam: bezos is the amazon board chairman, just not ceo anymore
[4:23:01] ChaoticPriest: Remoria...
[4:23:11] Galloglas_Kilt: @KingSlayerYotam exactly, he's still in charge, just not CEO anymore. More free time, just as much control
[4:23:22] EnragedSushi: Remornia *
[4:23:33] MuttonChopins: I'm just glad Mike made a new company
[4:23:42] Sollice: I would sooner bet on Bezos not running out for money for the next 30000 years before I bet on Gamestop making a comeback as a physical retailer
[4:23:56] Lego17: he only had a salary of 200K when CEO his wealth comes from his stock shares
[4:24:23] macrophages: how do I get on the board for Amazon
[4:24:25] Mecabeast: games moving to digitally owned is killing gamestop
[4:24:44] Sollice: @Lego17 Thats how they all make their money. Thats why their net worth in a matter of a day can shift billions because of the stock market
[4:25:11] Galloglas_Kilt: GME should take the money they made these last couple weeks and invest in adapting to the new market. Maybe some kind of app on game consoles to download games either through purchase or rent
[4:25:19] Sollice: Unless your Kotick and you make 47 million a year tanking good games and developers
[4:25:46] mavericks312: gamestop is still dead
[4:25:49] KingSlayerYotam: no

[4:25:58] Velashen: Everyone knows its a goner

[4:26:28] Oheson: Hard to believe GameStop lasted this long.
[4:26:28] raldrik: Might speed it up since the majority owners could have cashed out during this
[4:26:39] HankHedjman: the only shinning light is this publicity might give it enough to get investors to help develop an online platform.
[4:26:46] HankHedjman: that's where they're trying to go.

[4:43:46] iwipemyownazz: amen
[4:44:28] CaptainJoeyNY: Like the Lucid Knightmare? That was meaningful
[4:44:54] belaham: you go 4 weeks with no loot and you finally get one and it has bad stats on it LUL
[4:45:09] SteveSD: should just make loot like it was in TBC
[4:45:12] Mecabeast: I got a neck and ring drop last night traded ring cause wasn't an upgrade. only 1 boss doesn't have upgrades for me
[4:45:18] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: only loot source being the great vault sucks
[4:45:25] iwipemyownazz: Loot aside, im more bummed when i hear things like "slow dps" on end game raid content like sire.
[4:45:31] Xcerts: really? pog, guess ill keep grinding maybe in another 3 weeks ill get an upgrade
[4:45:38] Totemk0: meaningful is when a pve person gets 2100 pvp raiting :D and gets that nice transmog set

[4:45:54] pbnj_kills: I like getting two loot drops in 7 boss kills then having to trade both cause I don’t need them. But never getting loot for the slots I need
[4:45:57] Dyriks: I wish my friend would wait for me on reset day to do all the stuff :(
[4:46:16] SteveSD: I mean its basically impossible to pull threat off a tank
[4:46:23] Dyriks: here I am doing all the stuff alone LUL
[4:46:30] Affiiance: Yeah bosses not getting eaasier with more gear sucks
[4:46:30] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @SteveSD very wrong
[4:46:49] belaham: nice socketed ring
[4:46:56] SteveSD: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect not really you never have to wait for tank to get threat
[4:47:25] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @SteveSD as i said u are wrong. Seen so many tanks lose threat after they pulled solo. U are wrong
[4:47:51] SteveSD: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect maybe they are new and literary just auto attacked
[4:47:53] Masqerader: dude events in a row i got bracers... i have legendary bracers
[4:47:54] Skelatore12: cloak off shriek
[4:47:58] Masqerader: i de'd that shit already LOL
[4:48:05] Sollice: nope
[4:48:25] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @SteveSD just admit it that u are wrong wth. Some tanks are able to lose thzreat..and sometimes not even new tanks
[4:48:32] krompiurusha: yo is pally the best class? @Towelliee
[4:48:40] SteveSD: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect its never happened to me in any raid or dungeon so
[4:48:43] 91Niki: I got that neck 2 weeks in a row on my monk OMEGALUL
[4:48:44] Kromede: 29 POGGERS
[4:48:48] Sollice: That Use though seems dumb
[4:48:50] akia03: gotten that neck 5 times now
[4:48:51] Demanisraar: hard to get good neck nowadays LUL
[4:48:54] Sollice: Has anyone used that?
[4:48:54] D3m0nHunt3r666: little haste though
[4:48:54] Ogumel: Feels so good to get a new neck.
[4:48:57] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @SteveSD guess u are not pugging LUL
[4:48:59] TheCliffyShow: Well now, I gotta tell em.
[4:49:11] Masqerader: @Towelliee so ya my cache was shit lol
[4:49:15] iwipemyownazz: the only 2 items i need are trinkets
[4:49:28] SteveSD: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect i pugged ahead of the curve, threat meters dont exist lol
[4:49:44] paintman550: you dont get renown catch up at 28, 30 is max right now
[4:49:45] iwipemyownazz: Sire is 99% mechanics 1% dps
[4:49:49] Sollice: Did you already collect souls
[4:49:49] Mecabeast: so when you gonna boost sloot on illidan lol
[4:49:51] Affiiance: The renown catchup feels so slow
[4:49:56] iwipemyownazz: from a dps perspective
[4:50:07] Masqerader: ya but see
[4:50:07] SnakeDoc919: I'm convinced that neck and cowled batwing cloak are the only items that exist in the vault.
[4:50:12] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @SteveSD yea i was talking about M+ and yes u can easily lose threat as a tank. I always see it as a healer. I even get heal aggro in some pugs so dont tell me u cant lose thread
[4:50:14] Masqerader: I have the 235 legendary bracers lol
[4:50:17] TheCliffyShow: Feels pretty fast to me.
[4:50:25] cevyr1: feels fine to me
[4:50:28] MoodyVanessa: feels fast i got to 28 in 9 days

[4:50:34] TazzTheGrimreapper: the catch-up mechanic is easy peasy
[4:50:35] xluckydawgx: Its not slow, its inconsistent
[4:50:41] Thoreya: Ya the renown catch up is fast af
[4:50:45] Demanisraar: I got 15 renown in 2 days now
[4:50:52] magemaster225: big true

[4:51:01] Thoreya: Spam LFR and campaign
[4:51:01] Clicklesly: Wasn't for me really, took me about 2 weeks
[4:51:03] xire78: one of my alts is up to 19 after 3 days of being 60
[4:51:03] xluckydawgx: Its great but it is inconsistent
[4:51:04] NVbrutal: yea im renown 11 with only 4 hours played at 60
[4:51:14] Affiiance: I have a few alts and its slow on some and fast on some
[4:51:15] Kromede: even ketchup is rng
[4:51:16] Bluelocks: there is no alt friendly with the amount of loot raids and m+ are dropping lel
[4:51:22] Affiiance: But I have a lot to do in the game
[4:51:22] cazhually: don't even have an alt
[4:51:30] Clicklesly: And i couldn't finish campaign cause it was renown locked ^^
[4:51:36] magemaster225: you have to be doing the campaign quest. I think a lot of alt people dont do it
[4:51:38] xluckydawgx: True, I dont do LFR
[4:51:38] maggges: I’m turned off from alts because of torghast
[4:51:39] Affiiance: Yeah I havent been doing LFR

[4:51:54] cevyr1: i finally got hiugh enough ilvl to do lfr
[4:52:00] Masqerader: it only took me like 2-3 days to get to renown 20ish

[4:55:51] largefromage: koolHOLD
[4:55:52] Forlagon: I think its double-edged in that way. if you don't make it competetive then whats the point. but if it's too competetive people will throw in the towel

[4:57:53] akia03: casuals pay for this game
[4:57:58] piratechris: We pay the bills so yeah they actually should
[4:58:07] kodtheog: thats now 10 dungeons straight without loot in 12 key and up
[4:58:10] kodtheog: this is getting to be a joke
[4:58:28] Affiiance: I wish they would go back to making WQs fast and Easy. It seems like a small thing, but I used to do my WQs every day
[4:58:34] CaptainJoeyNY: just add nice loot drops to torghast and the casuals will stay
[4:58:37] bennythejet_ne: I’ve never played wow more and have never been rewarded so little
[4:58:49] Templexx: the sally and billys have the quietest voices too
[4:58:50] kodtheog: @bennythejet_nh i cannot agree with this more
[4:58:50] Lloyder47: i'm that billy
[4:58:54] swoopydk: thats me
[4:58:59] Bleusempai: literally me
[4:59:00] Rictamar: TRUTH
[4:59:04] jure__: @kaeod yea, its brutal. Like I havent gotten a weapon in my vault since launch. Im dying over here.
[4:59:04] Xerevil: @kaeod yeah it sucks,i've had 15 runs and no loot
[4:59:05] Mecabeast: I want my kill rare mob wqs back

[4:59:28] MuttonChopins: LFR Andy LUL
[4:59:30] Bleusempai: ayo! BM Hunter
[4:59:35] Sandisy: the people that play all day just roll alts if they finish gearing a toon. so who really cares if they can do it semi-quickly?
[4:59:36] bennythejet_ne: @lloyder47 Yup, sucks, might stop after hitting ksm, no other motivation and I dont want to pay for an arena carry
[4:59:40] Dyriks: I am not ashamed for being a super casual, this game helped me become an anti social piece of shit, which I am ashamed of being.
[4:59:52] CritcobainTV: WutFace
[4:59:59] Xerevil: anyone know the addon he uses for the call to arms( satchel)
[5:00:05] CritcobainTV: You gotta start worrying when you become a billy bob
[5:00:07] Fortvila: Honestly think they miss understood and thought retail players wanted the same kind of gearing as vanilla players.
[5:00:11] largefromage: i'm fine with being a billy but i want my damn sally
[5:00:16] largefromage: ffs
[5:00:18] Lloyder47: @bennythejet_nh i feel that. I just level characters now because i don't want to do arena
[5:00:25] TheCliffyShow: @critcobain What if it's Billy Bob Thornton?
[5:00:30] CritcobainTV: he sucks too
[5:00:34] Templexx: bunch of MDI teams didnt play and the brackets had no shows lol
[5:00:41] Affiiance: I mean having to put that much time into MDI seems demoralizing
[5:00:47] Clicklesly: MDI? You mean the NElf tournament?
[5:00:51] TheCliffyShow: @critcobain Whoa!
[5:00:53] laarrryy: I’ve kinda fallen out of love with wow... any tips to try and get back into it..?
[5:01:00] CritcobainTV: @Clicklesly lmfao
[5:01:01] Thoreya: AWC works so well for esports bc u dont have to put in like 70 hour weeks lol
[5:01:03] Kromede: yes
[5:01:04] Thoreya: MDI is a different story
[5:01:08] Sollice: @Clicklesly Dont think its NE anymore. DIdn;t they fix it where you cant invis prideful
[5:01:10] kodtheog: @laarrryy wait til this xpac is fixed first then come back
[5:01:11] bennythejet_ne: @lloyder47 Yeah man I get it, sucks
[5:01:13] pilhass10: KEKW
[5:01:15] cevyr1: I forgot it MDI was even happening with them being on youtube
[5:01:18] Mecabeast: something about only 4 teams did the SD time submissions
[5:01:28] Affiiance: Dude the Actual MDI Tourney in China was almost all no shows
[5:01:28] Forlagon: @laarrryy play different games untill you get interested again
[5:01:42] ZeethianDragon: Pve isn't reallyfun rn LUL
[5:01:46] HwmTheWigl: Didnt thye also only give the MDI teams like 5 keys to train on, instead of hte private server they usually get?
[5:02:01] Rictamar: because PvP is the best way to get PvE gear....thanks Blizz
[5:02:12] AstridLory: @laarrryy Join a friendly community
[5:02:23] CaptainJoeyNY: Also, didnt they cuck the conquesat cap?
[5:02:23] Thoreya: pvp gearing has nothing to do with mdi parcticpation lol
[5:02:34] Thoreya: its the fact that they have to play tourney realms 70 hours aweek
[5:02:37] CritcobainTV: LMFAO the next one

[5:03:59] pilhass10: echo is streaming now beacuse they didn't win KEKW
[5:04:09] Mecabeast: I think keys would be better if key affix were random per key and not have a predetermined affix order

[5:04:29] Templexx: no1 wants to watch it. no audience no reward. its so boring imo
[5:04:49] toobaked1987: Blizzard is such a cheap ass company whenever it comes to competing in their game. They give what .0001% of profits to them.
[5:04:50] Thoreya: i never really thought MDI was fun to watch honestly
[5:04:59] Thoreya: the concept of the whole thing isnt really interesting
[5:05:00] CritcobainTV: Fuck doing that for 2 grand for 2 weeks of work. i could work my regular job and make 700 a week and get a workout at he same time
[5:05:01] Thoreya: imo
[5:05:01] MuttonChopins: MDI was fun to watch in Legion but was boring to watch in BFA
[5:05:04] kodtheog: @Mecabeast what would be really cool is if as soon as you insert a key it gives you a random affix at the start so you have to adapt and do diff starts every single dungeon / up the loot pool
[5:05:15] akia03: last time it had like 10k viewers
[5:05:42] Bleusempai: i'm such a casual, i had to google LFR yesterday LUL
[5:05:48] piratechris: Doesn't LFR lock you for the week or can you just hit it again and again?

[5:06:16] Mecabeast: @kaeod I do like the sound of that but need more affix that are cancer to ranged to balance things out
[5:06:21] IxProNoobxI: Sire in LFR isn't as big of a shit show as I thought, they really dumb down that fight
[5:06:23] cowee12356995: Twitch mobile keeps playing the audio of ads over your stream for me guzuDank so I hear you and ads
[5:06:31] Thoreya: awc did well this weekend
[5:06:41] Thoreya: byut yea
[5:06:43] Thoreya: u right
[5:06:45] VictorAvalanche: how much are people making in POE?
[5:06:46] Affiiance: AWC is fun to watch
[5:07:04] Thoreya: fuckin xaryu was on front page last night and had 35k viewers lol
[5:07:05] kodtheog: awc is lit but yeah the whole youtube only is holding back exposure cuz twitch is still bigger then youtube in regards to gaming
[5:07:06] deedeemegadoodooo: AWC is way more entertaining then MDI
[5:07:17] HwmTheWigl: Do you think people are actually interested in PvP streams? Or are they just watching becuase they have to PvP to be competitive in gear?
[5:07:18] pilhass10: AWC>MDI
[5:07:31] kodtheog: i think pvp is awesome this xpac
[5:07:36] Thoreya: @HwmTheWigl i just think the interest to pvp is real
[5:07:38] kodtheog: and very rewarding
[5:07:45] Thoreya: pvp has been fun af this expnansion
[5:07:48] Thoreya: compared to BFA
[5:07:54] Mecabeast: I wish we could get some com audio from teams during both mdi and awc
[5:08:14] kodtheog: i mean your right
[5:08:15] kodtheog: 100%
[5:08:19] CaptainJoeyNY: PVP is the best way to get gear
[5:08:23] Wildside1177: You are exactly right.
[5:08:25] iunbearable: this xpac seems its built around pvp not pve this time.
[5:08:28] pilhass10: true
[5:08:30] kodtheog: cuz 90% of wow players are more pve players then pvp
[5:08:30] razma_: still shadowland is great so far blizz will adress the gearing next patch and everything will be perfect
[5:08:34] kodtheog: its a good statement
[5:08:35] spizzoo: but it is only good for a few classes
[5:08:47] spizzoo: imo
[5:08:47] SteveSD: seems like it, thats how you boost ilvl
[5:08:52] iunbearable: I said it "Seems"
[5:08:54] laarrryy: They need to fix the one item dropping from mythic dungs
[5:08:55] thebakeriscomingforu: WoW has PvP but isn't a PVP game. Never has been
[5:09:00] Rictamar: add badges and a PvE vendor and its fixed
[5:09:06] reinhardtdog: That would have been last expansion
[5:09:09] Rictamar: increase mythic+ and raid loot...voila
[5:09:10] Affiiance: They just need to make them equal in gearing 1800 CR,M 15s and Heroic Raiding should all give 220 ilvl Gear
[5:09:11] Thoreya: id love to the know the % of the playerbase that is participating in pvp rn
[5:09:12] ursinealli: If they were gonna do that, that needed to be in BFA lol
[5:09:16] TazzTheGrimreapper: pvp has always been a 2nd notion for this game
[5:09:24] HwmTheWigl: I mean... You get almost 1k anima for PvP quests, and only 250 for PvE content (garuntee'd)
[5:09:27] CritcobainTV: PvE team needs to get their shit together

[5:09:35] Hoodicon: I havent tried pvp
[5:09:41] kodtheog: why is it taking this fucking long to fix pve loot
[5:09:45] kodtheog: this genuinely a meme now
[5:09:46] Lloyder47: pvp should be rewarding but pve should also be rewarding
[5:09:50] Wildside1177: 2 pieces of gear from a heroic raid boss if there are 20 people in the raid. EFF OFF Blizzard.
[5:09:54] Thoreya: its such an easy fix to lol
[5:10:00] kodtheog: it cant be a hard fix
[5:10:01] Thoreya: idk why they just dont fucking do it already
[5:10:03] Affiiance: They should be equal in gearing 1800 CR,M 15s and Heroic Raiding should all give 220 ilvl Gear
[5:10:04] craigb_: let loot be loot ... helps when there is loot rooThink
[5:10:05] xXTHEJESTXx: I could see them saying lets give pvp some love this expansion
[5:10:08] Dark_lite7: what's taking them so long to fix it though? busy with other things?
[5:10:15] D3m0nHunt3r666: its funny that when the announcement came , pvp was nowhere to be found LUL. now the expansions hangs on it ruyuLUL
[5:10:28] Lundorf: i quit mythic raiding cos its not worth proggin to get 35 anima
[5:10:32] KronasKG: IOt nmeeds to be reset each tier
[5:10:32] Affiiance: Just like Conquest, theres a weekly cap and it resets each season
[5:10:34] kodtheog: @D3m0nHunt3r666 so true
[5:10:45] Thoreya: just make a new currency like conquest and do the same shit
[5:10:49] Thoreya: idk
[5:10:52] Thoreya: it cant be that hard lol
[5:11:03] brewbrewbear: PVE Season wipes though
[5:11:04] Holyman22: @ PVPs system is perfect this go around they just need to find the same for PVE
[5:11:08] Kushinaa: no
[5:11:20] Thoreya: i just think they dont wanna admit that it was a mistake it
[5:11:22] Thoreya: yet*
[5:11:30] Kushinaa: it reset and gave you gold at the end on a teir
[5:11:33] Lloyder47: Wrath had different token types for each teir
[5:11:38] bi9pants: Makes me wonder if they planned vers to be such a usful stat for PvE, that feels like it's the reason PvP gear is so strong. They need a dedicated PvP stat to avoid the cross over gearing problem at th moment
[5:11:45] kodtheog: why not make it easy just us a system that when you dont get loot in a key > gives us some point to towards upgrading our vault loot from keys
[5:11:46] 3663Sharad: WotLK system where a good start, but good a little bit to much with all the badges at the end
[5:12:00] Fl3tchTTV: i feel like if you have some kind of point system to purchase a determined piece of gear at 213 per week or a 226 every other week that would be fine, still taking like 10 weeks to get top ilvl and not even guaranteeing BiS
[5:12:09] kodtheog: thats a great fix
[5:12:12] kodtheog: i like that idea lmao
[5:12:15] CritcobainTV: They just need to bring Magni back and let him HEAL THE WOONS
[5:12:15] brewbrewbear: pretty sure the ilevel was always either 1 tier back or just under raid quality. It was a fail safe for "I just cant get bracers to drop" situations
[5:12:17] Rictamar: they will never do that
[5:12:20] Sincline387: "something stupid" that'd work really well actually
[5:12:23] Wildside1177: I'm listening.
[5:12:25] Thoreya: ppl wud be geared af quick
[5:12:28] Hitmanblood: how about the vault doesn't have the same slot as your legendary, doesn't have the same slot that you got the week before
[5:12:30] Koperniiik: Still no weapon for my arms warr :)
[5:12:30] Thoreya: i wouldnt mind tho
[5:12:30] Hitmanblood: good fix
[5:12:31] IxProNoobxI: I think they should allow you to pick 1 raid item and 1 dungeon item and or pvp item

[5:12:35] kodtheog: people are already geared asf
[5:12:36] 無職提督: tbf, thats kinda cheap shot
[5:12:38] kodtheog: cuz of pvp carries/pvp
[5:12:40] Todmeister9000: this sucks, still makes you play just for weekly rewards
[5:12:41] kodtheog: lmao
[5:12:41] Hoodicon: instead they release a $40 mount
[5:12:47] furansowah: I dont know... it feels a bit weird in an MMO if most of the gear you get is from vendors and not drops :(
[5:12:47] mrniceguy817: I mean how many piece of pvp gear are ppl able to get every week or is there even a limit?
[5:12:48] Rictamar: just make the vault drop loot for your lowest slots...
[5:12:52] Sandisy: let people unlock more than 3 slots. say you love m+, just let them unlock 6-9 slots by doing more than 10 per week

[5:13:18] CritcobainTV: I'm 220 ilvl and i'm still not exalted with venahri KEKW
[5:13:20] BigCarlM: ignoring the maw for the win
[5:13:22] KingSlayerYotam: please no fuck the maw
[5:13:24] shimwood: So much red LuL
[5:13:24] Kushinaa: still would ignore
[5:13:24] CaptainJoeyNY: whats valor again?
[5:13:28] Affiiance: The Daily Calling is dumb af right now
[5:13:30] Thoreya: i havent done the maw since decemember lol
[5:13:33] Thoreya: cud care less bout the maw
[5:13:41] kodtheog: id take ap over this current system
[5:13:41] bmi86: i just think the are to late at this point.. the damage is doen to the player base
[5:13:43] D3m0nHunt3r666: Towelliee for Wow dev
[5:13:46] s4boi: I liked Valor and valor vendors.
[5:14:05] Forlagon: i mean thats what a lot of the playerbase wanted
[5:14:07] s4boi: It gave a bit of meaning to otherwise meaningless content
[5:14:12] Forlagon: to not be forced into chores
[5:14:13] cronymahoney: maw is just a big LUL
[5:14:14] Wildside1177: Right now I check world quests for alt-geer. Do my calling on my main. And log out. Eff the maw, eff Torghast.
[5:14:16] s4boi: unlike 35 anima xD
[5:14:37] Thoreya: WoW is gonna have a real content problem going forward tho in terms of how they shud design the everyday grind
[5:14:42] Thoreya: for like 10.0 and forward
[5:14:47] Kromede: deep trouble
[5:15:11] Galloglas_Kilt: I love the Maw and the WQ's, don't understand what everyone complains about
[5:15:24] MWilco77: Sludge is easier in LFR than Shriek since Sludge is a tank controlled fight.

[5:16:13] thebakeriscomingforu: no new systems? its Blizz, they'll add something. Even if its to already existing systems
[5:16:16] Mecabeast: shriek is better when you have a blood dk pull a 4 trash mobs into shriek
[5:16:21] thebakeriscomingforu: Renown to 80
[5:16:21] Affiiance: Has anyone tried Denathrius LFR?
[5:16:25] kodtheog: other games are doing fine and updating lots of shit during covid
[5:16:39] thebakeriscomingforu: More legos, new areas, dungeons, and raids
[5:17:01] loutre_malgache: You onlyu get Renown from the last boss of each wings
[5:17:41] Clicklesly: Do you think there'll be higher lego ranks too? Otherwise they'll just get outclassed by like 275 items at some point ^^
[5:17:46] GoKu1g: the WQ loot will always be LFR level tho
[5:18:13] givmeafrekinname: lol they lusted
[5:18:35] kodtheog: i just think even the new areas arent even that big and they are getting boring now
[5:18:35] Dark_lite7: Do you think they have been working on things to show at Blizzcon online?
[5:18:45] kodtheog: @Dark_lite7 god i hope so
[5:19:02] Hoodicon: expansions are massive compared to a game like SWTOR
[5:19:17] craigb_: be happy it's a pillar and not the wall in LFR <_<
[5:19:43] Wildside1177: That skin is awesome.
[5:19:49] FruckAwesome: they usually stomp the pillars..
[5:20:06] craigb_: ^^^
[5:20:13] Todmeister9000: KEKW
[5:20:14] shimwood: LuL
[5:20:15] Kuttting: close one LUL
[5:20:18] largefromage: LUL
[5:20:22] xluckydawgx: AHAHAHA
[5:20:23] Dark_lite7: @kaeod a part of me expects them to show very little and for everyone to be very salty about it LUL
[5:20:24] CritcobainTV: lul
[5:20:27] D3m0nHunt3r666: LUL
[5:20:31] 無職提督: thats a really close one
[5:20:34] craigb_: rooKek not jinx seen it happen enough
[5:20:36] kodtheog: @Dark_lite7 im already expecting that
[5:20:46] D3m0nHunt3r666: Calculated Towelliee, he hit it with his pinky ruyuLUL
[5:22:00] quiZZ_TV: <3 lirikH
[5:22:11] Hasselqt: hey! i just started playing bommie. but mainly for pvp. would you recommend haste or mastery. ill mainly do 3s and rbg on it
[5:22:13] quiZZ_TV: ye me too :)
[5:22:26] xire78: That show was not bad
[5:22:40] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i watched it, it's pretty good all the way thru
[5:22:43] esceti95: shooter is good the acting is a bit meh sometimes but overall 7/10
[5:22:56] CritcobainTV: yes
[5:22:56] shimwood: Last thing I saw him in was Cruel Intentions LuL
[5:22:59] loutre_malgache: You only get Renown from the last boss of the Wing @Towelliee
[5:22:59] kodtheog: yeah they are
[5:23:03] xire78: yes same person
[5:23:03] CritcobainTV: it's the same thing, just in a series instead of a movie
[5:23:09] Lego17: same person
[5:23:09] lunchbox8669: supposed to be the same character
[5:23:12] esceti95: yeah mark is the producer of shooter#
[5:23:18] Ganlaorn: @loutre_malgache That is not true
[5:23:37] Ganlaorn: I got 3 on my alt last night from 2 wings as well. :)
[5:23:41] hbombs: 15 person raid. 4 melee. is it better to have a MM hunter doing 5k dps or warrior doing 3.5k and battle shout
[5:23:48] akia03: did you finish night fae campaign
[5:23:51] jason_shade: i liked shooter(the show) but felt like it was a guilty pleasure show
[5:23:59] jason_shade: like i knew it wasn't "good" per se
[5:24:02] Clicklesly: That's kinda the issue, renown is so random you don't really know what's best for your char to do ^^
[5:24:14] jason_shade: but i was entertained
[5:24:18] MWilco77: I got no renown and 1 piece to gear from all of the LFR wings last night on an alt
[5:25:01] Clay2K_: lol rip again
[5:25:09] KKrugzz: @Towelliee you might not get anymore renown for the week. I've heard that if you complete the 2 cov weekly quests before getting within 2 of max, you will stay below the max
[5:25:52] Kushinaa: whao bro you dont like the epps
[5:26:11] razma_: it caps you to last week cap (so you need to wait until 28) before turning your weekly

[5:54:27] jason_shade: crowdfund it but actually put some effort into it
[5:54:36] jason_shade: like valve does
[5:54:46] smashwow: blizz just needs to invest in the MDI. they could run adds put that rev into the tourny pool or caster wages or production etc. there's a lot of options they could do. they just don't.
[5:55:39] Kushinaa: what would you get in gamne for it?
[5:56:24] smashwow: or you know instead of pocketing the money from toy sells that should have went to the prize pool. put it in the prize pool.
[5:56:44] Yagr6: 2021 everyone a mlg pro gamer... thanks icy veins
[5:57:31] Affiiance: Dude people are serious af in all ranks of PvP right now

[5:58:48] jason_shade: there are exceptions, but if you aren't playing a chosen class right now you're having a bad time
[5:59:12] jason_shade: that's why all these mains that play other classes are just playing like hpal, war, mage, etc now
[5:59:20] Yagr6: I genuinely like rbgs I wish blizzard would do something with it
[5:59:21] smashwow: 100%, i just hope blizz wakes up and does the right thing with it.

[6:00:11] RunningOutOfRAM: @Towelliee what % is doing MDI level shit or Arena above 2.5 ?
[6:00:12] smashwow: esports creates foot traffic for the actual game. it's just advertising
[6:00:16] Shomagenpogen: id only be hype because of the money
[6:00:22] Gyhlen: isn't that what sponsors are for?
[6:00:22] Shomagenpogen: not because of the game itself
[6:00:25] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: RBG tournament would be more fun to watch compared to AWG
[6:00:25] Velashen: Blizzard has always done it wrong.. pumping loads of money into it to artificially grow it. Look at Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm.
[6:00:27] AcidAbyss: its marketing i think they think its a profit item
[6:00:31] CockneyRat: normally you see that boost in other areas of the game
[6:00:38] Thadune: @Towelliee No one?

[6:00:51] ichitos: What’s the prize pool in overwatch?

[6:00:56] azzurrin: WoW eSports are just boring to watch and hard to follow if you're not a WoW player
[6:00:57] Todmeister9000: state farm
[6:00:57] Hitmanblood: how much does it even cost blizzard
[6:01:00] Naturalbeef: This is the disconnect. I get a sense they are thinking of a return on the MDI investment
[6:01:08] 3663Sharad: No one? T-Mobile and others are Blizzcon only
[6:01:15] CritcobainTV: FUCK
[6:01:17] CritcobainTV: leave group
