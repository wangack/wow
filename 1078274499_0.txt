[0:15:29] Aquadriel: also do you mean start as in... start 9.1? or start shadowlands lol
[0:15:37] ElDrakenMan: 9.1 yeah
[0:15:41] banshay3: If we get to kill Sylvanas, I want to finish Jaina too

[0:16:25] I_DoctorSatan_I: By the way, you're only killing 1/2 of Sylvanas anyway, Val'kyr has the other part of her soul that keeps her alive. Kill the Val'kyr that has her soul in a "vessel" (lantern actually) then you kill Sylvanas...for good.
[0:16:30] Aquadriel: you should be able to fly this week then, again.. assuming renown catch up works and lets you get to 44 @drakenPWN
[0:16:35] DragonofWolves: blizz already said we weren't going to actually kill her.
[0:16:42] abracka_: @I_DoctorSatan_I sounds like Voldemort
[0:16:45] I_DoctorSatan_I: i know....
[0:17:10] I_DoctorSatan_I: im just pointing out the fact ppl dont understand why she doesn't die xD

[0:18:11] abracka_: @I_DoctorSatan_I 9.2 Harry Potter & Gang join the game and we hunt down her horcruxes
[0:18:14] I_DoctorSatan_I: "reeeeeeeeee, she's killed millions and Blizzard isn't killing her off yet, but we dont kill her in 9.1...whyyyyyyyyyy!".....well, duh, need to go after Val'kyr in Ice Crown that retains the OTHER part of her soul.
[0:19:01] banshay3: @Apileew bfa?

[0:23:09] KillaPr0: yes kickass villain
[0:23:27] I_DoctorSatan_I: The story writing is so bad right now...how they going to let Anduin yoink the Winter Queen's Sigil like that...lol without ANY type of interaction. FailFish
[0:25:23] Aquadriel: at this point, story is the last thing i care about the game LUL been like that since bfa they changed WoD story
[0:25:49] DragonofWolves: Well technically they can't DO anything to Anduin because he's being controlled
[0:26:15] Aquadriel: interesting plots like azshara and nzoth were thrown in the bin, each in 1 patch, just to further funnel sylvana's story 🤷
[0:27:00] Kedemel: I don't see them ever being able to write themselves into a good story from this mess without a huge climax to this story and something of a reset. But that's just my opinion.
[0:27:07] I_DoctorSatan_I: "Oh hi Mark, I'm just gunna take this Sigil real quick (Anduin takes sigil)....ahh, well, it's been a fun party guys, but I gotta go...(chucks the deuces as Anduin enters the portal). "Ok then....well, we lost another Sigil...DRINKS ARE ON ME!!" (everyone in Ardenweald gets shit faced).
[0:27:31] PadidinJones: Rejoice for @Towelliee has RETUUUUUUUUUURNED!
[0:27:31] DragonofWolves: but everyone's opinion on the story is theirs. imo I'm enjoying it.

[0:27:34] abracka_: i wonder if we'll see any interactions with arthas
[0:27:41] Thoreya: aside from the obvious slyvanas plot armor i dont even think the story is THAT bad rn
[0:28:51] abracka_: @Thoreya agree, it's nowhere like GoT S8 bad thankfully. i think we're all just confused as shit to where this is going and grasping at straws is making us spin stories that sound awful
[0:29:31] mortiswow: This intro is so cool actually
[0:29:37] thexxxfonzy: @abracablacka I hope so
[0:29:50] I_DoctorSatan_I: @abracablacka Watch Uther's eyes as he looks at Anduin as they both pass each other in Bastion when Anduin meets the Archon. Uther covers his "scar" where Arthas stabbed him. Uther saw Arthas in Anduin b/c he knew something wasn't right about Anduin.
[0:30:02] Thoreya: i think thats why i like the story now as opposed to like legion and bfa bc we have no idea whats gonna happen next
[0:30:09] Thoreya: i think thats cool
[0:30:15] Aquadriel: i enjoy more the small stories you find around the world while questing. But the main plot i find unpleasant. Specially when the feed it to you on a 6 month basis lmao.
[0:30:42] PotbellyGoat: towHAMUP good morning
[0:31:01] Kedemel: It's not as bad as GOT S8. LUL That's a low fuckin' bar.
[0:31:19] Thoreya: i erased got season 8 from my memory..it never happened
[0:31:44] I_DoctorSatan_I: this story line is worst than Mortal Kombat: Annihilation 4Head LUL
[0:32:39] nocturnal_2195: Good morning everyone and towelliee
[0:32:42] I_DoctorSatan_I: I think everyone agrees the intro to 9.1 when Anduin just casually walks in and takes the Sigil with zero effort is just pretty bad story writing
[0:33:06] Aquadriel: anything anduin is pretty boring to me, tbh LUL
[0:33:32] I_DoctorSatan_I: like who does that...ALL the forces in Ardenweald and the Winter Queen just leaves the Sigil unguarded by meer pesants to watch over it as Anduin just bowls them over
[0:33:44] drcoleworld: towHi

[0:55:13] Gapz: @Towelliee Well, if anduin survives all that mind control should make anduin go crazy
[0:55:15] SinicalDev: Yeah I guess it ushers in a new era for the alliance, similar to the horde their main leader might be gone. Feeds into possible dissolving of the factions

[1:17:01] Lincoln_WoW: method got out the credit card this tier for sure
[1:17:11] SilkeySmooth: the wow community has a short memory about what method did
[1:17:22] Aquadriel: method 5th from a guild that literally was build from scratch after the -not to be named- issues, is IMPRESSIVE
[1:17:22] ravensky93: @Towelliee do we know how many hours until the raid comes out?
[1:17:25] I_DoctorSatan_I: You need Rank 6 to buy the pattern Research Report: Adaptive Alloys to upgrade gear from Rank 4 (220) to Rank 5 (226) 4000 Research. Then you need to purchase Research Report: First Alloys for 8000 Research to upgrade from Rank 5 (226) to Rank 6 (233). @Towelliee
[1:17:31] Boccardo316: Do you think New World and AOC can compete now with FF being also popular like wow?

[1:17:43] Simmo_rs: What are you playing this raid? @Towelliee
[1:17:46] falldrgn: @SilkeySmooth I don't think thats the case. It's more how are they going to respond to what happend.
[1:17:50] konmenos: Pieces to win
[1:18:05] GlakusWoW: FSY are pumpers too
[1:18:08] PadidinJones: Sup @Towelliee hows it hanging?

[1:18:25] Armdel: just copy strats from VoD EZ
[1:18:28] NeihanaNZ: I'd love to see FSY nolife it for a tier
[1:18:32] Deggon: what time does raid open up? actually excited to watch this raid
[1:18:34] falldrgn: @jnrburga Several top guilds are doing that.
[1:18:34] wolvepg: Ya the only reasoning i would think he would say that is to show people how silly it sounds when they say they make the game for the 1%
[1:18:38] ThaOriginalGamester: i want the chinese to come out of nowhere and take first LUL
[1:18:39] akia03: and china tos and rules are different aswel so tey can do allot more that eu and na cant @Towelliee

[1:21:26] nyypsycho: The CHinese are ruthless bro
[1:21:31] manmower: work in 12 hours shifts, could make up the time by throwing numbers at the problem
[1:21:32] luksior0301: When is the raid coming out?

[1:39:44] HopeThePriest: Idk most people i know playing TBC are not playing retail so Id disagree
[1:39:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: mostly because of my friends
[1:39:54] xsp00n: plus, i feel like tbc is already in a Raid-Log kind of mode, unless you pvp
[1:40:02] Aquadriel: even with the weird timing.. TBC hype is 'gone' cause now is just log in to do 1 hour of raiding and come back next week.
[1:40:04] securesteve83: What time does Limit start their raid at? @towelliee
[1:40:06] elunesdruid: Yeah because TBC is boring and not everyone was playing it... Glad 9.1 was not taking longer
[1:40:10] Shugaze: tbc rn is raid logging or mote farming
[1:40:24] cthraxxi: when NA servers getting reset ?
[1:40:26] Sincline387: leveling takes much less time in BC so it's already down to raidlogging, thus it looks less "popular"

[1:46:59] shungilungi: Do you think we will get a cinematic at the end of the raid? Or mythic only??
[1:47:08] imdonexd: flying doesnt feel as satisfying with the relevant content being in the maw since u wont be able to fly there

[2:11:44] Donny_TBC: Which video is this
[2:11:49] vixxkixx: lets start betting, Limit or Echo? who wins this tier?

[2:11:58] EllisTheMenace1: @diathi123 nerf what?
[2:12:01] gregl__: @diathi123 since when does blizzard care about community backlash

[2:12:35] lithium364: a prophetz
[2:12:39] JStevenson: woah....big prediction
[2:12:40] vixxkixx: my money is on Limit also, but i think Method will do better than we think
[2:12:44] Barkerisonfire: @dimofodi Mythictrap
[2:12:47] Crinoxo: *second race
[2:12:48] Caibo1: @dimofodi mythic trap
[2:12:48] Llamatude: Thats a bold move cotton, lets see if it works out for them!
[2:12:49] jkitchin75: bold move cotton
[2:12:51] iseenoobpeoplee: if they remove the reset advantage limit will not win
[2:12:53] Armdel: i find it more likely that half of Echo quits the game or go casual
[2:12:53] nick1295: Maybe not to Method, but that would be rough for them
[2:12:56] xRykku: Isnt this Echo's 2nd?
[2:12:57] skoxxinator: i agree
[2:13:02] Robodope: year of the spear survival hunter top dps on WF kill
[2:13:03] dimofodi: Thank you @Caibo1 and @BarkerIsOnFire !
[2:13:04] LunarBrigade: @vixxkixx thing is, if Limit wins again, Echo will scream “we’re a new guild, we’re so good”
[2:13:15] vixxkixx: :D
[2:13:16] DwarfWarrior25: im saying method 2nd
[2:13:16] Hargy_: do you know a way i could get a limit invite?
[2:13:17] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[2:13:24] DragonofWolves: echo formed after the method drama towelliee you realize that
[2:13:26] OhNoNotAgain: My money is on Shade taking WF
[2:13:28] LunarBrigade: Funny thing is, Echo is 90% old method
[2:13:34] luckfore: so method would have to kick all their new members? Lol
[2:13:34] DehCantao: I think he meant echo's players lost as method 2 tiers back
[2:13:43] CajunCrusader: Where do you have BDG in your predictions @Towelliee?
[2:13:43] EllisTheMenace1: @LunarBrigade everyone knows that
[2:13:56] bue8: when is the patch out in NA ?
[2:14:00] Paulyepsi: We can bet on anything in Australia hahaha
[2:14:01] Charionne: when does raid come out?
[2:14:01] Catspaw66: The wf race is Limits to lose and Echo's to win.
[2:14:08] JonnyScotland: @luckfore they would if they are better than them, that's the way guilds like that work, the best get in the team, it's not about being nice
[2:14:15] SinicalDev: Wonder if multi-team guilds will become more common as the scene consolidates. If Limit Team A or B win it doesn't matter, still a Limit W
[2:14:19] Llamatude: Cotton McKnight : I'm being told that ECHO does not have enough players and will be forfeiting the championship match. Pepper Brooks : It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.
[2:14:23] vixxkixx: it's gonna be super interesting for sure
[2:14:23] Moobot: TBC has officially launched! || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch!
[2:14:26] dimofodi: @Towelliee what would be the point of going back to Method, they lost as Method, then Echo, then Echo again, so they go back to Method?
[2:14:31] tripl3heart: Method will suprise i think
[2:14:32] LunarBrigade: @ellisthemenace1 I previously stated that Echo will cry saying they’re a new guild again if Limit wins. Like they did last race.
[2:14:47] Vanderlong: did NA realm went down or not yet?
[2:14:51] MrSmurfy: Did the raid get released in US?
[2:14:53] IamFlizzey: Hey guys, when is resett on NA?
[2:14:55] bagaragan1: Any one know when raid will be open?
[2:14:55] Llamatude: not yet @Vanderlong
[2:15:04] DragonofWolves: well whichever guild wins RWF you know people are going to bitch about the time difference
[2:15:08] Llamatude: after reset
[2:15:09] ElPolloBatman: maybe they'll just settle for doing molten core instead?
[2:15:09] Vanderlong: @Llamatude ty
[2:15:10] gundamzeros01: NA down in 1 hour i think
[2:15:13] soth_klf: Do you think China could be worlds first if they would have the same Reset as NA/EU?

[2:16:11] antori_92: your welcome
[2:16:14] Scoodles91: but then again you have two teams to learn and clear the strats?
[2:16:16] bue8: they will account sharing ?

[2:16:18] kaze171: MonkaW 41
[2:16:21] Alepouditsa: that sad
[2:16:21] Armdel: many*
[2:16:22] LunarBrigade: @shac20 shame everyone copied it, though smart to do so.
[2:16:23] I_DoctorSatan_I: Can't wait for RWF teams to hide their streams so they aren't giving away their LEFT MOUSE CLICKING and WASD strats ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:16:24] MrGattz: @bue8 oh ofc
[2:16:27] Yngvezs: well the swedish betting sites have bets for RWF
[2:16:29] tdpark_: 24/7 nonstop, that sounds insane
[2:16:30] luckfore: gina
[2:16:30] stealthx23: so dumb this race needs rules
[2:16:33] Thoreya: the problem is progressing on bosses tho
[2:16:34] RocketMan23: ya but now you are splitting up your experience and practice on each pull
[2:16:36] Panadol324: After all, Echo is officially a separate guild, but in real life it is a separate unofficial wing. Method: P
[2:16:37] Hargy_: sounds loose
[2:16:43] KingDiguez: china has alot of good players
[2:16:46] JonnyScotland: I bought 8 gear tokens for my druid and got 7 pairs of shoulders, not kidding
[2:16:50] vixxkixx: China numba huan fo sho
[2:16:52] knoxis10: that's essentially 2 separate teams though no, it's not like they're learning the fight 24/7
[2:16:52] Zoludar: but then you got 40 people with limited gear on them unless they are doing 2 mythic squads and putting the higher geared into 1 team after 1st week?
[2:16:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna need more sleeping pods
[2:16:59] dehash1: when is the raid going live in na?
[2:17:02] DehCantao: China was already known to have long sessions, imagine what they will do with a 40 men roster
[2:17:08] Thoreya: like theyre gonna split progress on slyvanas with 2 teams
[2:17:08] NotDillyTV: Kind of feel like with 40 they might be spreading gear out too much
[2:17:12] Thoreya: idk thats viable
[2:17:16] daniel85mg: yah, people memes about china.... but there is a lot of passionate players
[2:17:21] akia03: soon it will be 1 us 1 eu and 1 china team going for rwf
[2:17:27] Kisswani: Avatar
[2:17:29] hawee11: Yay
[2:17:35] Kisswani: Alpha yeah i think
[2:17:36] DragonofWolves: @jonnyscotland that'd be my luck too knowing my luck
[2:17:38] diabolik45: if echo did lose why would going back to method benefit them?
[2:17:50] Armdel: new rwf is to be grinding 24/7 inside and outside of raid
[2:17:53] jrossino: God damn mongorian take my shitty world first!!
[2:18:06] Oldduketree007: My guild killed blackhand 20mins befor reset befor hellfire started xD
[2:18:06] AdamGCurtis: ETA on raid drop?
[2:18:08] akia03: @diabolik45 more money
[2:18:08] xsp00n: I feel like Method would just absorb the best of Echo
[2:18:10] gardianclown: They can’t account share so second group would be gimped on loot
[2:18:15] bue8: how much ilvl will give m+10 ?
[2:18:15] ElDrakenMan: there gonna have 100% uptime where as limit and them gonna have at leasst 6 hours of downtime
[2:18:15] imdonexd: those guys are psychos pulling that many times with the environment they raid in
[2:18:16] George2001k: I hated Kil’Jaeden as a warlock… no immunity so no invite!
[2:18:36] Dynamorh: when it come to the Chinese you cant fault their work ethic. they will go till they drop
[2:18:37] Zwaae: wouldnt they have to account share to do that?

[2:35:06] Kisswani: I mean , isn't t logical that you can't fly between zones ?
[2:35:08] xsp00n: But i mean, the zones clearly show that you cant fly between them, like if you just look at it you can put 2 and 2 together
[2:35:10] NelsonGamingShow: die like we deserve
[2:35:10] noway137: idk

[2:51:34] Recording_on_the_grass: lol
[2:51:35] murrayman01: pally
[2:51:36] greemteam: whats point of tier list if they cant rank them accurately
[2:51:38] moiksen: eu works fine for me
[2:51:38] bgriff87: Pally Kapa
[2:51:39] Panadol324: Hunter pet is an S !! :D
[2:51:39] fyfaentv: Do you think retail wow ever will do a full reset like FF?
[2:51:40] Lincoln_WoW: druid doesn't bring a debuff/buff
[2:51:41] murrayman01: i reckon they'll scale silly this tier
[2:51:41] artiBEAST: Pally Kappa
[2:51:42] Lincoln_WoW: so they can't be S
[2:51:43] bgriff87: Kappa
[2:51:46] TheCliffyShow: Bee Tanks?! There's a bee race?!
[2:51:47] giantbuckethead: Maybe Paladin?

[2:52:17] Moobot: @Broomba NA Btag | Towelliee#1402
[2:52:21] Amazanmartyn: is eu down
[2:52:23] artiBEAST: Blood DK big amz Veng -> Debuff Monk -> Debuff Warrior -> Buff
[2:52:35] IianaDRK: it sounds like every tank is great but not a single 1 brings "everything" so none can be considered S
[2:52:36] Broomba: @Amazanmartyn no eu isnt down, i am on eu now
[2:52:40] Sollice: I actually think its amazing that all tanks are not so far from eachother. That means the majority of people ( mythic raiding withstanding ) can really play whatever they want and be effective which is awesome
[2:52:43] Alepouditsa: @moiksen i was lvling on silvermoon to move there coz my is full of hordes, i ges i will not be doing it
[2:52:51] bgriff87: I need to level my Spriest
[2:53:00] stumpycheese10816: @Sollice that's the biggest W honestly
[2:53:05] brianlawl: @sollice so true. its nice as a casual

[2:53:12] byrdeen45: Really hopeing tinker cl;ass will be in next xpac
[2:53:14] Lincoln_WoW: tank balance is super close right now. maybe the closest its ever been
[2:53:20] KPable: wait fire mage is a C+?
[2:53:28] Sollice: I dont play tank but it certainly makes it easy for your guild to have players who want to tank being able to tank the character they want to
[2:53:30] LosingFaith: sucks i love wow so much but the sub and the content right now just doesnt feel worth the money
[2:53:34] greemteam: fire mage got nuked from orbit
[2:53:48] Alvari: will we see the raid's end cinematic today?
[2:53:56] brianlawl: good no more fire mage top lemme play arcane

[3:14:31] Belirs: whats a final fantasy ?
[3:14:33] Crowzcut: lol ff14
[3:14:35] Oldduketree007: dying*
[3:14:36] sleeper_8: and then the hate comes roaring back
[3:14:36] bgriff87: danRain tfw you're enjoying wow
[3:14:46] kokochris: @bgriff87 same man, danRain
[3:14:49] kurewax9: Do you like final fantasy compared to wow?
[3:14:50] robgodd671: servers down?
[3:14:57] mavericks312: imagine thinking WoW is dying
[3:15:10] belaham: people just love to complain tbh
[3:15:11] Malkyr: honestly I hope we see a bunch of the super negative people leave after all this is said and done. The game will be better for it
[3:15:12] Funderik: they would soon cry if wow was to shut down lol
[3:15:14] Shrenko: imagine actually enjoying WoW 4Head
[3:15:21] kokochris: here is a wild idea. You can like more than one game !

[3:16:12] Crowzcut: i feel for annie the money from ff14 his gone
[3:16:26] Todmeister9000: there are a lot of tourists in wow too :)
[3:16:31] Eraste: id try FF14 but Ive never played any FF ever so I'd probably just be too lost
[3:16:33] Funderik: i've noticed too, that the ones tying ff14 tolerate the same problems wow has because it's a new experience lol
[3:16:33] Oldduketree007: you gonna buy 230 gear for you pala? ;P
[3:16:33] Honvar: Only for streamers @sthanopala
[3:16:38] herpderpdoublederp: did you speak about Asmongold being called an idiot? and that whole saga
[3:16:49] Erthelmi: Lula is doing the world first caster?
[3:16:49] Kinghorn: ???
[3:16:51] Dragonkiller1974: how do you feel about new world i was in the alpha and i liked the game combat is a lil clunky but still good
[3:16:52] Malkyr: She has made a fortune riding this wave
[3:16:54] Crowzcut: they paying her to play it
[3:16:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: she got like 10000 subs in a week the money is still there LUL
[3:17:01] zooyep: i mean.. i think there's a lot riding on this patch now that there's a second option (kinda) though
[3:17:03] wasd123wasd456: ALSO LOOKS LIKE SHIT
[3:17:03] sleeper_8: I used to play FF its the perfect filler between patches considering the FF endgame is only the savage fights
[3:17:13] Deggon: Poor Crowfall, launch day during the ff14/WoW 9.1 raid day
[3:17:13] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[3:17:23] Hazno: WoW isn't going anywhere for a long time
[3:17:27] Dark_Kornax: Dark_Kornax subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[3:17:28] Shrenko: Crowfall is dead
[3:17:29] kokochris: Thats good man, she should do what she feels is right for her community.
[3:17:31] volkreig: FF14 feels so chill compared to WoW, though I much prefer the endgame to wow
[3:17:39] nitefalltv: how are you online?
[3:17:39] MrGattz: crowfall was dead 8 years ago lol
[3:17:39] Shrenko: the game is a shitshow
[3:17:44] thekrispwns: crowfalls combat fells soo bad
[3:17:46] TheBenShee: she needs to milk it as long as possible. she knows that her stream wilkl die down to u nder 500 asap again.
[3:17:47] Sollice: @Erthelmi She is. She is part of the casting team for Limit on RWF
[3:17:50] thekrispwns: and it runes like ass
[3:17:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: thats a bigoof
[3:17:54] Malkyr: Yeah I play WoW, FF14, and ESO. All have their own things to enjoy
[3:17:56] ArchmageSora: WOW had produced some of the best content producers on Twitch. Period. HahaCat
[3:18:02] Moose_Ka: Moose_Ka subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 15 months poggggggg
[3:18:03] ArchmageSora: *has
[3:18:08] Kdropk: After saying I would never play FF14 after being a wow veteran I can say it is much much better than expected
[3:18:13] Dark_Kornax: are you on EU?
[3:18:13] bgriff87: Definitely will attract the Warhammer Online fans
[3:18:25] Deggon: oh and also the launch of the 2 new tlp's in lotro as well
[3:18:25] RunningOutOfRAM: I just dinged 60 FeelsBadMan
[3:18:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: ffxiv just look pretty amazing on a ps5
[3:18:36] Sollice: @Codename_Astro Ehhh I dont know about that
[3:18:37] Hazno: there's no doubt FF14 is a good game, it wouldn't be as popular as it is if it wasn't
[3:18:37] luckfore: i tried and didnt like the combat/graphics
[3:18:40] nitefalltv: How are you still on the servers?
[3:18:46] Hazno: @nitefalltv EU
[3:18:46] RiPTide: The big draw for me is I preferred the difficulty of OG Heroic WoW dungeons, hate the go-go elitist Mythic+ dungeon mentality. FFXIV doesn't force that on you to progress.
[3:18:49] ArliePlays: @nitefalltv he's on EU rn
[3:18:56] Scraggersmeh: FF14's leveling is an absolute snoozefest with how slow the early combat is. I can't put myself through it.
[3:18:56] nitefalltv: @Hazno Thanks :D
[3:19:00] mpaul: until he shits all over that one too
[3:19:00] NILLme: EU login servers are dead atm..
[3:19:09] snipsfan: yes 100%
[3:19:09] RunningOutOfRAM: Is all EU DOWN /
[3:19:17] jkitchin75: @RunningOutOfRAM no
[3:19:20] Funderik: honey moon period, soon enough he will find grinds, systems and things he don't like.
[3:19:22] ArliePlays: im still on EU just fine :3
[3:19:33] Shrenko: Sword of Legends on friday @Towelliee
[3:19:33] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee DO NOT RELOAD or RELOG Auth servers are down :)
[3:19:34] NILLme: @ArliePlays close game and try to log back :D
[3:19:35] DeanoTV: I have a lvl 70 on FF and i just can't bring myself to quest on it again too boring imo
[3:19:40] giantbuckethead: @Towelliee Asmon himself said he wanted to start maybe playing different games after his break earlier this year.
[3:19:40] Sollice: At the end of the year you could have three big MMOs. FF14 Endwalkers, MAYBE a 9.2 WoW and New World if its good
[3:19:47] bgriff87: WoW is my main and I tour FF14, ESO and SWTOR.
[3:19:48] I_DoctorSatan_I: D2R will bring in some viewers for long-term Diablo players / fans.
[3:19:48] RunningOutOfRAM: @RunningOutOfRAM FellsBadMan
[3:19:50] JonnyScotland: competition is good for wow players
[3:19:53] Malkyr: Exactly. No one should only play one game, you get too invested and minor things rub you the wrong way that wouldnt even be noticed by most
[3:19:54] TheCliffyShow: I played a little Final Fantasy XIV when I got it for free from Twitch Prime. I thought it was alright. Might go back and play some more now that you can play for free till 60. I wasn't fond of the graphics though. I like the more colorful look.
[3:19:56] robgodd671: @nitefalltv i live in EU And mine are all down lol
[3:20:01] Moose_Ka: mmos is a niche genre. it's good to go out and play more and support the ones you like
[3:20:03] comp1: he was on rust yesterday, running around stealing ppl horses
[3:20:06] Moose_Ka: help keep them going
[3:20:09] Xailen: Wildstar was my other MMO go to...
[3:20:11] Aidler: let‘s just hope he enjoys FF14 and not invades it
[3:20:12] Sollice: SWTOR could be interesting also with the tech improvements. Whatever those turn out to be
[3:20:21] Kensarafluffy: that is true :v
[3:20:26] Eraste: ESO is my only other mmo, and only really to just do the story stuff, solo

[3:20:33] chris_chirs: are servers up??
[3:20:35] Spacetortoise: Endwalker is going to be absolutely huge. Hoping it lights a fire under the WoW team
[3:20:39] Hazno: @ChristopheChillin EU
[3:20:40] Kisswani: The thing is , for someone to make the switch it has to include endgame . not just the leveling process
[3:20:41] Rottencoarse: @Sollice i'm trying swtor atm quests seems meh atm
[3:20:42] Eraste: SarionWoW as soon as servers are up
[3:20:48] chris_chirs: ohhh @Hazno ty
[3:20:50] Ibloodraven: SWTOR would be top tier if the engine wasn't so clunky imo
[3:20:56] kokochris: @Eraste same, my problem with ESO is the combat is too easy. Its hard to die doing the story content.
[3:20:59] Xsilentghost: Any chance servers come up early?
[3:21:00] TheCliffyShow: I played a little Final Fantasy XIV when I got it for free from Twitch Prime. I thought it was alright. Might go back and play some more now that you can play for free till 60. I wasn't fond of the graphics though. I like the more colorful look.
[3:21:03] Moose_Ka: swtor def has other problems
[3:21:04] DeanoTV: I have a level 70 on FF and i just can't bring myself to quest on it again too boring imo
[3:21:06] Qyame: Retail WoW is like the fat wife you come home too and still love after 15 years - Asmon 2021
[3:21:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: endwalker is gonna be the first time since 1.0 ff14 that I plan to be there day 1
[3:21:11] Shrenko: @Xsilentghost well ofc, there is allways a chance
[3:21:12] Moose_Ka: they barely add content to the game
[3:21:21] ItsToxicQT: same here I'll always play wow as my main MMO until they shut wow down @towelliee
[3:21:21] Moose_Ka: and SWTOR is my second favorite mmo rn
[3:21:26] Malkyr: WoW still has the best combat out of any MMO, which is why PvP is so popular
[3:21:27] chris_chirs: how is pally tank?
[3:21:30] Sollice: Reaper class from what we see from Endwalker looks fun
[3:21:32] Sam_Nash: lol
[3:21:34] Moose_Ka: Talking about swtor dude
[3:21:38] Naturalbeef: Sounds like the FF community wishes he leave. They don't want him to bring the same toxicity that he brought to the Wow community
[3:21:41] swordart_19: Haters in chat PepeHands
[3:21:46] Doublezoh: does anyone know if the maw intro quest experience ist still bugged?
[3:21:52] bgriff87: @Moose_Ka Im hyped for the next expansion with the combat changes
[3:21:54] Shrenko: outside raiding and m+ ? not so much
[3:21:57] ElDrakenMan: is LFR out for the new raid as well?
[3:21:59] swordart_19: GUys if you dont like move on , no idea why you follow wow and just talk trash

[3:23:19] Qyame: i mainly do ATT because i hate all other content LU´L
[3:23:21] Shrenko: I heard good things about Swords of Legends @Towelliee will you try it out this friday when it releases?
[3:23:21] ArchmageSora: The only thing the probably did 'casuals dirty' on this expansion was raid difficulty in old content, but the higher item level from gear in this patch will help tremendously.
[3:23:24] Hazno: @Dezlul in EU
[3:23:28] Sollice: I think the best thing for ANYONE who feels burned out on WoW is to play other games. Skip some WoW content for a while and when they come back there will be new things for them to do
[3:23:29] DragonofWolves: Well 9.1 does have content whether or not you like that content is up to you
[3:23:30] TheCliffyShow: I left the game for 7 years and played other MMOs like SWTOR and ESO. Came back with a new vigor.
[3:23:37] Nokterian: I don't hate WoW at all guess i'm burned out right now so playing FFXIV feel refreshing lots of nice people
[3:23:42] Dezlul: @hanzo thanks
[3:23:42] robgodd671: log out and abck in lol they all down
[3:23:44] thekrispwns: is solo not the 7 or is it just me ?
[3:23:45] tricky_the_bull: I couldn’t touch a lot in mythic castle but i do high mythic+ keys and hoping i can do mythic sanctum when my guild can do it
[3:23:46] I_DoctorSatan_I: BabyRage jUsT gIvE mE mYtHiC gEaR sInCe i dOnT rAiD BabyRage
[3:23:51] Moose_Ka: I just want towelliee to be aware I was talking abiut swtor cause they don't add content to that game. I don't play wow anymore
[3:23:53] Aidler: then maybe the problem is they put lots of stuff into the game many don‘t like to do. maybe
[3:23:58] Dezlul: Ashes of creation releases Saturday
[3:24:01] Shrenko: official launch yeah
[3:24:05] Kisswani: @Sollice it's why i'm loving 9.1 , took a break for like 6 months now it just feels sort of fresh again
[3:24:07] Teldrin89: @Towelliee do you think serv will be down for full duration or even extend?
[3:24:08] Sollice: @Dezlul An ALPHA releases
[3:24:20] chris_chirs: @Hazno out here helping dumb americans hehe
[3:24:21] cabalish: standart, deluxe and collectors edtions
[3:24:21] Gappopo: I love all the content in WoW. The type of issues I have come from their terrible class balancing acts and how drastically they nerf classes/specs. Having to regrind renown because blizzard wanted to nerf fire mages to the ground just feels bad.
[3:24:22] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee when is the swtor expac release? this year?
[3:24:24] Hazno: I get people got impatient waiting for 9.1, but seriously, just stop subbing and play other games while you wait, WoW doesn't have to be the only game you play! I know I enjoyed other games while waiting
[3:24:26] Nokterian: towOny towOny towOny
[3:24:29] cabalish: towOny towOny towOny
[3:24:29] xsp00n: New raid, M+ season, pvp season, new questing hub, story, FLYING, on top of 16 years of content..but blizz help, theres no content
[3:24:32] Vivelli: i think ppl are just tired of the status quo when it comes to content produced into WoW? idk ive taken a break because of that reason for sure, but i aint gonna hate on someone that likes it
[3:24:32] Moose_Ka: Sword of Legends already has like 4 raids planned I think
[3:24:34] ItsToxicQT: lol
[3:24:35] byniehs: FBPass KEKWDISCO

[3:26:07] chris_chirs: @bantuatha not NA
[3:26:14] Shrenko: yeah servers up they banned alot of people though so might not get in
[3:26:25] Ashekor: what is this bait D:
[3:26:29] chris_chirs: lol
[3:26:30] Sollice: Yeah. NA bans went out for a lot of people because they asked too many times if servers are up

[3:27:37] Jamertamer: I quit wow for few month and was rwnown 6 when I left, came back and got 38 this week. is it possible for me to get 44 today or will I have to wait another week
[3:27:37] Weenkadin: Went into Korthia at 135 on my DH. The scaling made it not terrible. But definitely had to be careful pulling.
[3:27:51] TheCliffyShow: I've been thinking about trying out FFXIV and Black Desert Online again.
[3:27:59] Moose_Ka: sword of Legends looks really good and is fun to play but runs kind of like ass
[3:28:08] Sollice: I was excited for Red Desert, but I guess its a single player thing now so ehh
[3:28:11] StonedScoob: im excited for New World
[3:28:15] Hazno: GW2 was a ton of fun

[3:41:56] lalelusa: EU's got problems with authentication apparently
[3:41:56] Nick_Vs_Games: well we dont know if she survives in the sense of her physical body continuing on... and her soul gets sent to the shadowlands and we continue to interact with her soul

[3:47:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: stab ysera with a red crystal and you good Kappa

[3:51:17] I_DoctorSatan_I: I bet they are waiting on the "top" guilds are ready to enter the raid. They don't care about the rest of us. Let's be real, we'll get to play when the RWF guilds are ready.
[3:51:29] swdpolyjk: is the raid out?
[3:51:32] Kisswani: @Towelliee https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RGKOz_4x1I this one he means
[3:51:33] duffluv22: Secret Mythic Sylvannas fight? like Garrosh?
[3:51:35] memnon94: I think after the riad, the Jailer will have no use for Sylvanas, since he has Anduin
[3:51:52] Jamertamer: the new wow vido
[3:51:54] Funderik: @I_DoctorSatan_I that's a cringe take
[3:52:00] Belirs: 📣 any rich players

[3:52:42] Kittsuera: 10 players donate 1mill and that would work
[3:52:51] sehxiedonuts: how much raids does wow get per expansion ?
[3:52:51] Calath: can we kill aduin instead of saving him?
[3:52:52] polocampbell: Are the servers back up??
[3:52:59] Archiee: we're going back to ICC... Anduin kills Bolvar and takes the throne becoming Arthas 2.0
[3:52:59] Blah206: LOL
[3:53:00] Eraste: blizzard stopped doing mythic phases.. and no, nzoth doesnt count
[3:53:00] Calath: anduin
[3:53:03] GermanBacon: towKing
[3:53:05] NuttyNatsu: the one with a kidnapping fetish
[3:53:06] filos0phia: Anduin is one of the only people with the power to go between realms
[3:53:06] zanches98: what do you think this next raid cinematic will be about?
[3:53:07] akia03: or he gets bored of andiun and returns him
[3:53:07] yeldnel: should have taken thrall
[3:53:08] Belirs: KEKW
[3:53:10] bgriff87: towKing WTF
[3:53:16] Panadol324: anduin will by boss in a dungeon not raid , he dont deserv to by in a raid :D :P
[3:53:17] mavericks312: hell jaina woukld have been a better choice
[3:53:18] Funderik: his connection to the light
[3:53:20] Austei: green jesus
[3:53:21] filos0phia: Anduin is one of like 3 people that can move between realms freely
[3:53:21] Kisswani: should have taken Talia Fordring
[3:53:21] Kevst0r: anduin being evil brakes morale
[3:53:22] Theduskflyer: Anduin, is the next Lich King. There must always be a kick king
[3:53:22] memnon94: He should have gone for Gamon..
[3:53:23] KnsWoW: yea isnt he supposed to be child of light
[3:53:24] Masqerader: Wrathion is gonna show up and be like "hey guys i heard about this cloak that will help us save anduin and our world"
[3:53:24] SilkeySmooth: Manduin needed chr developement
[3:53:26] I_DoctorSatan_I: MAGNI should of been chosen
[3:53:26] JesikaPlays: It's like...Anduin, really? I mean okay it's your choice, but....
[3:53:27] xhaven: it wasnt just pure power he needed
[3:53:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: its gonna be a shit show once that end trailer comes out
[3:53:29] mmrghost7: imagine if arthas shows UP
[3:53:32] filos0phia: he wants him so he can open the gateway to azeroth
[3:53:32] Belirs: even genn would have been more effective KEKW
[3:53:38] Bayne77: its the hair
[3:53:46] lilwaldo: @Towelliee Maybe because he's young and has a lot of room for improvements that he could over come?
[3:53:48] filos0phia: he is the only person who has the power to move between dimensions
[3:53:54] fabibi_10: mass res tho
[3:53:55] filos0phia: because of his pact with the Light
[3:53:56] Waspire: it comes full circle ..... arthas to become lich king dies goes to the maw... anduin goes to the maw. and comeback as another lich king.
[3:53:56] Masqerader: wouldn't he just steal our hearthstones?
[3:54:02] CuppyCakes: icc 2.0
[3:54:04] Masqerader: or talk to an innkeeper
[3:54:06] FrankTizzle: I think they chose Anduin because of the similarities to Arthas (boy prince, trying to be good); I know that the book lore doesn't matter but there have been a lot of allusions of Anduin being tempted to Void powers there @Towelliee
[3:54:09] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:54:10] Belirs: maybe the jailers plan is to steal the giant sword thats still stuck in azeroth KEKW @Towelliee
[3:54:13] porowozek: invasions 9.2 wow!
[3:54:13] Nokterian: A CUP OF TEA
[3:54:17] Nokterian: LUL
[3:54:18] strike879: @towelliee its not the power why he took anduin but the conection to light to infiltrate elysian hold
[3:54:22] lalelusa: well, the Light waged war upon Revendreth and won, so maybe it's just about revenge. Either that, or he's ntrying to lure Wrathion in
[3:54:22] akia03: jailor joins the light hehe
[3:54:27] Funderik: tbh andiun needed to look like a badass for once, instead of looking like he's about to cry in cinematics.
[3:54:32] dawnovun: @Towelliee did you know that the raid that's coming out today was initially called "Rectum of Domination" however it got renamed last minute?
[3:54:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: sargeras gonna show up to fight the jailer and be like i tried to stop this shit from happening
[3:54:40] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee I just hope they do more with the invasion than what they did with Nzoth....
[3:54:42] AstridLory: Lmao
[3:54:43] mmrghost7: jailor goes bananas
[3:54:49] kharnij83: he is going to go to sw and get the hearthstone experience greeting and just kill them all
[3:54:52] Eraste: "Jailor, something has spooked one of the brutasaurs, sending it in to a PANIC!"
[3:54:52] Nomad_Manny: Nomad_Manny subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! Good mornings Hammer Squad !
[3:54:54] Archiee: @Towelliee have I told you about our lord and savior The Light?
[3:54:55] catlinv: Jailer comes to Stormwind. Tyralion says "Wololo". Jailer joins Light
[3:54:57] filos0phia: The Light is the only power that can move freely between dimensions and Anduin is one of the few people with the power to open gateways
[3:54:58] kharnij83: expansion
[3:54:59] maalow: iy's the Arthas path, he too was mentally weak and a strong sense of justice
[3:55:00] Blah206: lol
[3:55:04] Recaud: I do wonder if the Light and the Shadowlands will be developed more.
[3:55:04] Belirs: everyone "having fun in shadowlands" :) meanwhile 🗡️ PrideWorld IM DYING
[3:55:05] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee Week 2 of the Patch 9.1 Mythic+ Affix Rotation is Raging, Volcanic, Tyrannical, Tormented
[3:55:06] Masqerader: Tough time traveling to Azeroth? DId he fly Delta? If so, I understand
[3:55:09] Kittsuera: plot twist Jailor is working for the light lands
[3:55:14] Lonely_piggy_: Where's Arthas at tho. Fuck Anduin LUL

[3:55:27] Belirs: tyrranical without pride monkaS
[3:55:27] Kisswani: did you test tormented ? @Towelliee
[3:55:33] Anathdra: jailer is just a collector and wants the big sword transmog from silithus
[3:55:36] Vivelli: nzoths visions of sw and org burning could have represtend the jailer, not nzoth himself
[3:55:38] gfield2k: Isn't there a daily quest up in the Throne Of Kill'jaeden area in TBC ?
[3:55:43] FortuneDd: Idk man either way it goes I’m HYPED that’s all I gotta say
[3:55:45] neverbornlucky: the maw portals are buttholes

[3:56:29] high_maintenance511: Does someone have a link to current event lore of WoW? I think I am not up to date on the current story?
[3:56:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: jailer shows up is a giant, pulls out sargeras sword then cleaves azeroth in half, meanwhile magni is calling you to heal the woons

[6:06:39] porowozek: Hymnal 233 is better
[6:06:45] EthicalHermit: I think it is going to be a good trinket, esp for how "easy" it is to get
[6:06:45] magemaster225: they dont know if the rppm is nerfed yet, thats what was really broken
[6:06:45] jason_shade: it's usable, but not better than mythic hymnal
[6:06:48] Belirs: i like it :)
[6:06:53] Sollice: I sometimes wonder if armor, trinkets whatever has some sort of random stat range that gets applied to it and the devs don't manually add the stats. How do you release a trinket that you nerf by 42%. How does that get out there
[6:07:10] majindarkfire: @Towelliee changeling has a 30% uptime and is pretty much the same trinket so prob a 20% proc nerf
[6:07:14] CritcobainTV: I need to watch the fate scribe fight that one looks confusing
[6:07:14] BlueBlurPrime: you ran into beams lol
[6:07:16] Belirs: LUL mythic pinapple btw
[6:07:26] magemaster225: yeah tome had a 65% uptime
[6:07:45] jason_shade: @Sollice i wonder the same, it's not like they released a lot of new trinkets lmao
[6:07:46] maccaruso: Oh, so it's the beam's fault?
[6:07:53] raptorstrick: That’s pretty helpful. Even a cartoon
[6:07:57] Belirs: @Sollice we had the ´tazavesh necklaces with 160 main stat proc on ptr for 2 months LUL

[6:43:40] JLFord78: Do you think we'll end up with the soul of Varian to help us break Anduin free?
[6:43:45] Beet4: After we come back from the shadowlands it's been like years and years in the real world and everything is changed
[6:43:48] pk99: I mean he aight I don't think he's that cool
[6:43:50] jerseyfive: he is also a lolcow
[6:43:53] timminsz: Jailer is such a boring villain though. Hes literally the embodiment of the mustache twirling big bad guy
[6:43:56] mavericks312: if they did it with guidance they can do it with the jailer
[6:43:59] ghazzgul: i think they say the jailer isn't the last boss in this exp
[6:43:59] Eraste: next expansion jailor opens a portal to a THIRD timeline of draenor Kappa
[6:44:00] kyshen3: Aren't people tired of the big bad cosmic threat, let's get back to the adventure.

[6:45:20] byniehs: yeah wtf is arfus
[6:45:24] xUrb4n: some guy was saying the jailer will turn sargaras sword into a one of his mourneblade things
[6:45:24] CCG_337: I expect Arthas will show in today's cs lol
[6:45:25] raptorstrick: He calls down the old gods
[6:45:25] magemaster225: anduin is now the green ranger and we have to save him from the jailer in 9.2
[6:45:26] fanousis: I think blizz said that the chapter Arthas is closed and it wont open cause he is just too powerful
[6:45:28] Sonatta: Uther redemption arc with Arthas
[6:45:30] Sam_Nash: big daddy uther will save us! they did him dirty!

[6:46:17] Sollice: Arthas/Uther still have a lot of potential. I don't think thats something people would tire of right now
[6:46:20] xvoidslayerx: Arthar redemption is a joke MingLee
[6:46:21] CCG_337: arthas: OK BRO
[6:46:26] al3xs_mx: Arthas story should be done! he should be only important to uther and nothing else
[6:46:32] k0ridian: EU
[6:46:32] MainlyHigh: wheres varian at?
[6:46:33] glyksi74: Void vs Light is the logicial content for 10.0

[6:48:59] Opscurum: @Towelliee what trinket were you just talking about?
[6:49:00] JonnyScotland: @MainlyHigh i think the way he died means he doesn't get to be in the afterlife afaik
[6:49:01] liegangames: now the powerful healing trinket from the new dungeon got nerfed
[6:49:04] Sollice: Varian is not in SL. He is suppose to be dead dead. But anything is possibloe I guess

[6:49:53] bcrums101: What do you have to do that you can't do normal mode?
[6:50:00] Brandishblade: I think showing what happens when a character die's in lore ruins everything
[6:50:05] Sollice: @bcrums101 It will run against his guild raid time
[6:50:07] bcrums101: You going right to Heroic?
[6:50:15] Thrixel: They just extended until 2 pm pdt in Battle.net description

[7:15:08] narrxs: can just jaina and thrall couple up, horde and alliance can mix /s
[7:15:28] CCG_337: I liked this quest haha
[7:15:30] Masqerader: Faction story died in Cata
[7:15:31] justpeacealways: BFA was enough faction shit for me
[7:15:33] bantuatha: I mean why Azroth still getting overrun by zombies?
[7:15:34] bgriff87: BFA tried to bring that back already
[7:15:35] Ezekyler: faction pride died in THeramore
[7:15:37] HAMMERRAZOR: you know whats awesome, if you go to lakeshire after level 60, the farm changes to the shadowlands events, its pretty cool
[7:15:42] Eraste: but BFA story was so good Kappa
[7:15:42] Agnarr84: Down the road, I’m sure we will see all removal of class restrictions and cross faction play
[7:15:52] justpeacealways: Fuck bfa zzzzzzz
[7:15:52] Hjolt: Lore wise it seems pointless and petty, to squabble like that in face of new threats
[7:15:54] justpeacealways: rerererererere
[7:15:55] A_Klimas: it always is lame because we always team up at the end anyway
[7:16:00] Recording_on_the_grass: lmao
[7:16:01] Masqerader: besides how often can you repeat the same narrative? We are hate each other and then a big baddie shows up and we hold hands
[7:16:05] Sam_Nash: danLUL danLUL danLUL danLUL danLUL
[7:16:07] Wcvechten: instead of fighting, could just focus on developing the stories within

[7:16:24] Proliphic: time gate
[7:16:27] Throdio: Most of the factio9n story in bfa was via the mission table, and they gave up on it after the second raid
[7:16:40] Ezekyler: Order Halls FeelsBadMan
[7:16:41] bantuatha: @Towelliee Azroth will surely awake and kill entire planet that we worked for 20+ years for NOTHING
[7:16:43] Agnarr84: Yea it will be a change of the game itself
[7:17:06] Hjolt: still, MoP opening missions for horde and alliance full Call of Duty style was epic. And none of you can prove otherwise LUL
[7:17:08] Masqerader: and the battle for azeroth made no sense.. go farm this substance to power our necks to save Azeroth while using the same shit to kill each other with
[7:17:08] vvibez247: race changes should not have been implemented
[7:17:08] stwitchie2: bam warmode then
[7:17:34] crawcook: I actually like how it is now, some parties like Anduin and Thrall try to build peace between factions, but at the same time you have smaller parties like Tyrande and Greymane who want to cause a war with some faction.
[7:17:42] filos0phia: are servers up yet fam?
[7:17:51] justpeacealways: Alot of people on original PVP servers complain about warmode and it blows my mind.

[7:20:37] divinedevilxd: @Towelliee what are your thoughts on faceing sylvanas do you think its to soon or are we finally going to kick her ass
[7:20:38] crawcook: I bet she goes rogue and just chooses Illidan route, will try to make her own plan to kill the jailor.
[7:20:39] Morpheusx25: @Syphin3 so like us for the past 2 xpacs lol
[7:20:54] Hjolt: dont you touch Anduin, i've literally watched him be a 8yo boy for like 6 years. guy's like a digital family
[7:20:56] Throdio: Slyvannas and Auduin are going to marry at the end of expansion, and thats how we get cross faction
[7:21:00] iheb_lock: what about kel'thuzad
[7:21:02] Nismonic: team thrall!
[7:21:04] dkapocalypse: she finds her old ranger half
[7:21:08] Epiclurker27893: plot twist, the Jailor sends Nathanos to shank sylvanas.
[7:21:13] HailToCarnage: what if the jailer only wanted to leave the maw to finally see moonguard goldshire
[7:21:15] Proliphic: idk though bro, every cut scene since the end of BFA has been playing up her role and her plan being exacted through all of this. I get the feeling she's playing the Jailer
[7:21:20] Galadeon: Jailer going to turn Sargeras' sword into a mournblade to take control of Azeroth.
[7:21:24] Ryenonn: She has to pay for Tedrassil!
[7:21:32] Masqerader: Maybe the Jailor does some shit to Nathanos or she confronts him over it and betrays the Jailor
[7:21:33] kappaday23: he knows Kappa
[7:21:33] abbosss: KEKW
[7:21:38] dareetv: plot twist, the mythic difficulty will have a secret encounter involving anduin XD

[7:21:56] stwitchie2: do u play Alt so u don't ruin content? or can't play main?
[7:22:03] dareetv: @Towelliee what version are you playing?
[7:22:06] bantuatha: BEN NO THIS IS A TRAP
[7:22:07] waterboy821: I think the ultimate is that Anduin is going to betray the jailer as the final plot of this xpac.
[7:22:23] crawcook: She isn't, she wouldn't look so surprised in all the cinematics if she did.
[7:22:25] xcyteme: Magni's popping up yelling "Chaampion..." and erverybody incl. Sylvanas beat the shit out of him
[7:22:27] Pablo1983: Azeroth awakens and rips the sword out of the planet to kill the jailer bringing on the new sundering

[7:22:49] Zivs: @Khaeil eu
[7:22:55] CCG_337: NATHANOS: Fly you fool!
[7:23:02] abbosss: the jailer is using her, and she's realizing it
[7:23:02] Aidler: I hope Nathanos delivers the deadblow to Sylvanas…
[7:23:03] raptorstrick: She will be on the run because of night elve lady
[7:23:04] jrossino: Anduin will become the new Lich believe
[7:23:04] zgag: For days like today this is why guilds should delay Tuesday raiding days for when a new raid is being released.
[7:23:05] warrenny: The battle made that obvious
[7:23:06] kharnij83: bwamsambi saves the day
[7:23:13] warrenny: Plus that post cine battle
[7:23:14] onous_: Anduin wakes up and this was all just a dream.
[7:23:14] Sincline387: Anduin is gonna tell the jailer to get fucked at the end of the expansion and release the voidlords on azeroth
[7:23:15] JLFord78: I think we get Varian's spirit to help us get Anduin back
[7:23:18] Masqerader: Maybe he kills her valkyrie
[7:23:19] struss27: Sylvanas will get wounded by jailer and we stop attacking her and never kill her.. she runs off and comes back with Garrosh and end jailer later
[7:23:23] Galadeon: Just look at Sire. Jailer did not give 2 fucks
[7:23:23] jrossino: We will go back to ICC and fight lich anduin
[7:23:25] warrenny: Post castle cibd
[7:23:32] kharnij83: varian doesn't have a spirit he died of fel
[7:23:33] KragnosWoW: Is the jailor really that strong?
[7:23:34] justpeacealways: I thought there was someone the jailer was working for though @Towelliee
[7:23:38] Eraste: good help is so hard to find, now days Kappa
[7:23:44] Epiclurker27893: I'll take your head just as I took his head. Wait, he didn't tell you did he? It seems the jailor is keeping secrets from you. - Tyrande
[7:23:46] Sollice: Jailer didnt need to care about Denathrius once he give him his sigil
[7:23:49] meroxzx: if you want something done right,,, you gotta do it yourself
[7:23:56] Wulfknightz: jailer keeps her around to have his "fun" with we know that is the only reason
[7:23:59] zacpuentes: plot twist the runecarver is the jailer
[7:24:00] A_Klimas: yeah honestly unless Sylvannas is playing some 4d chess here, its kinda lame she's getting played this hard by the jailer
[7:24:15] kharnij83: genn saves Sylvanas and they banshee work babies
[7:24:15] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[7:24:25] dareetv: denathrius made the dreadlords?
[7:24:35] dareetv: i missed something
[7:24:41] iheb_lock: well she can't do anything about it
[7:24:41] Sollice: @A_Klimas What hasn't gone according to the Jailers plan so far
[7:24:48] Belirs: with bfa we are at sylvanas playing 6d quantum chess with multi dimensional time travel
[7:24:51] Masqerader: Meanwhile in the void
[7:24:58] Hjolt: well sylvanas is just a very sore elf that wanted vengance after all. she's not that smart
[7:25:02] Winnie_theBro: ETA for servers back up?
[7:25:03] Sollice: Everything the jailer has wanted he got so far
[7:25:12] A_Klimas: @Sollice im talking about Sylv
[7:25:22] waterboy821: @winnethebro 5pm EST
[7:25:31] Kisswani: Sylvanas : " Pull the ripcord " reeee
[7:25:33] abbosss: so basically everyone at the start of shadowlands
[7:25:35] KragnosWoW: me too sylvanas me too..
[7:25:46] iheb_lock: but ion wants her to make a meaningful choice KEKW
[7:25:46] mmrghost7: sylvanas and jaina will marry arthas , they will live happily ever after
[7:25:48] petrel63: @Towelliee I loved tha Raid Shadow legends stream, but I think I'm hooked
[7:25:50] crawcook: Based on the cinematics I think we can clearly tell by now that she truly believed Sylvanas thought the Jailor could improve the system that in her eyes looks broken.
[7:25:51] Winnie_theBro: @waterboy821 BibleThump
[7:25:51] Hjolt: but then there would be jailer order. yep
[7:25:53] perssonsz: how many hours is left until the raid comes out ? :)
[7:25:57] Belirs: wait if the jailer wins we cant die anymore so we will finally get cutting edge POGGERS
[7:25:57] bantuatha: @Towelliee And now she is okay hanging out in the Maw with the Jailer?
[7:25:58] kharnij83: doesn't matter anyways the TVA will come at the end and reset everything and we get to go back to WOD.
[7:25:59] HailToCarnage: sylvanas hates the expansion so much, she became the villain of the expansion
[7:26:01] dedrenziboy: Jailer is gonna ditch Sylvanas as soon as he gets the sigil of the arbiter... After which she is sent to the 9.2 area, which is like the frostmourne soul vault thingy...
[7:26:19] Wildside1177: I don't think the Jailer's real plan has been exposed yet.
[7:26:20] Somakutala: Does the jailer even care about azeroth?
[7:26:22] Aidler: sylvanas hates death… then she is really helping the right guy… him being death
[7:26:23] TakeTheLeap_DJ: How do we fix it? Aliens
[7:26:31] A_Klimas: I still dont get why she teamed up anyway. she hates arthas but she should hate the jailer more by that logic
[7:26:31] crawcook: She might become the next Jailor?
[7:26:32] MacAckerman: @Wildside1177 Fcats
[7:26:39] crawcook: but in a nicer Maw?
[7:26:40] TheEndIsNear777: Fcats
[7:26:44] EyecuGaming: i think she kills the Jailer
[7:26:47] Dogmi_666: arthas comes to save sylvanas maybe O.o
[7:26:51] PToastman: defeat Sylvanas with the power of family
[7:26:52] A_Klimas: yeah maybe she wins
[7:26:58] iheb_lock: the end has to do with korthia
[7:27:04] Hjolt: but whats after that?
[7:27:07] KragnosWoW: and then what
[7:27:12] Belirs: no his true plan is stealing sagaras sword LUL
[7:27:14] Eraste: but like, y tho?
[7:27:15] Wcvechten: yeah but why kill it
[7:27:16] Wildside1177: I don't think that is true. I think there is more to it.
[7:27:16] CritcobainTV: jailer just wants to smash sylvanas t bh
[7:27:18] A_Klimas: then he just sits there haha
[7:27:27] struss27: After Jailer wins, Kungen spawns..
[7:27:29] Sam_Nash: danS danS danS danS danS danS danS
[7:27:29] bantuatha: @Towelliee Then where is the world soul? it is still asleep
[7:27:34] abbosss: isnt azeroth still recovering from getting shanked?
[7:27:37] mmrghost7: Nzoth will come and smack jailor down
[7:27:39] ToastLamoan: I want to know the exact tie in with the Jailer creating rune weapons and Lich King type slaves
[7:27:44] Sollice: Jailer wants Azeroth because he has found a way to absorb her power
[7:27:45] Wcvechten: can't wait to see another invasion zone like Uldum and Vale kek
[7:27:47] MacAckerman: I wonder if Turalyon will have anything to do with it
[7:27:47] KragnosWoW: so why didnt guldan go to shadowlands i dont understands
[7:27:48] Hjolt: if i know blizzard they will still feel the need to add more flavor than just destroying azeroth. @Towelliee
[7:27:49] Belirs: still sleeping with a giant sword in her back KEKW
[7:27:59] crawcook: The jailor basically wants the power of death to rule everywhere, in all realities.
[7:27:59] chefjayare: Turalyon is gonna be like "What the fuck is he"
[7:28:01] Epiclurker27893: The Jailor wants death to be in full control hence why he had the other orders infiltrated by the dreadlords.
[7:28:02] bgriff87: towCringe
[7:28:04] Sollice: Then once he does that he will be strong enough to fight all other cosmic forces and take on everyone
[7:28:07] Dozep: what time is the update

[7:28:49] Wcvechten: I'm game
[7:28:54] Sam_Nash: could the jailer kill sargeras theoretically?
[7:28:57] HailToCarnage: diablo shows up, and challenges the jailer to an arm wrestling contest for control of the maw
[7:28:57] Kisswani: I wouldn't mind a protos main
[7:28:59] Sonatta: we going to space bois!
[7:29:00] Aidler: the Titans wont like that…
[7:29:00] KragnosWoW: Azeroth gets destroyed, tencent buys out blizzard and riot mmo releases @Towelliee
[7:29:02] iheb_lock: and then illidan comes back after he willingly accepts to be sargeras's body and then punches the jailer in the face
[7:29:03] crawcook: Finally that marine tauren will make sense Kappa
[7:29:09] Hjolt: Draenai is arleady protoss enough
[7:29:11] Sincline387: Jailer kills us in the final encounter and we hear "Fire main cannon" in a russian accent.....
[7:29:17] arturiuss44: The Jailer is really guldan in cosplay. ;)

[8:45:19] lithium364: imagine they get hacked, and the servers are actually ruined for days
[8:45:29] Agnarr84: Maybe they are too optimistic on how long it would take?
[8:45:31] Coppermedusa357: blizz a bunch of bums figure it out totally unacceptable
[8:45:36] MacAckerman: They just dont care about the customers anymore

[8:45:47] SilkeySmooth: multi dollar engineering team
[8:45:51] A_Klimas: I can imagine in situations like this, content locks and branches are loose since not everyone is in the office. There isn't really any "core work hours" so more bugs are likely introduced.
[8:45:53] logic_fl: Dont they usually get ddosed around patch day fairly often?
[8:46:07] Cooky_28: I an slowly realizing that blizzard isn't carring anymore and they only cares about the money. :)
[8:46:12] Naturalbeef: Not a happy look there
[8:46:17] DragonofWolves: blizzard hacked? they mostly get DDoSed. I don't recall blizzard ever getting legit hacked

[8:47:34] medikadedmonk: 3 pm PDT now

[8:47:47] Archiee: i hope that's the case
[8:47:48] luckfore: theyre fixing the raid
[8:47:50] jason_shade: in CN when this happened it was because the bosses were fucked and they found it in QA on launch day
[8:47:54] Xailen: they might be fixing that performance issue that cropped up with 9.1 for some people
[8:47:55] luckfore: pushing tons of hotifixes to raid

[8:48:36] Eraste: the cash shop is broken Kappa
[8:48:43] Jherny: Torghast is so bad it broke the game
[8:48:50] zgag: This is why raiding guilds shouldn't schedule a raid on a new raid release
[8:48:56] dutchie76: when i bring up the map in korthia i get lag
[8:48:57] Krewger_: Is the whole team back in the office or still remote?

[8:49:06] perssonsz: i agree with that guy
[8:49:07] Raaktor: He said it, THANK YOU!
[8:49:11] perssonsz: borghast
[8:49:15] OhNoNotAgain: Quick send Magni to heal the server woooons
[8:49:17] Mackadeus: Anduin broke free of the Jailer and they're trying to put his leash back on
[8:49:18] Cooky_28: no offence, but I like torghast :)
[8:49:19] HeBeDead: i imagine the team is in house for a major patch deployment, but who knows
[8:49:20] DragonofWolves: well if something got bugged in the raid they could be hot fixing something. I know you remember when limit caused a boss to despawn for the entirety of US
[8:49:22] Ryenonn: The finally figuired out how to make rares spawn in Korthia and that was unexceptable :P
[8:49:28] Oneeye2cu: Afternoon Towelliee Hello stream
[8:49:28] Raaktor: I don't get why Torghast gets sooo much hate.
[8:49:29] craftyyydoggg: torgast is ass lol 😆
[8:49:34] Merex760: It could be something as obscure as a quest in some low level zone. That kind of shit is annoying as fuck to find
[8:49:36] Teldrin89: ok, but apart from PTR they for sure have a QA/DEV one and this like world boss crashing server seem to be something they would have found in testing
[8:49:38] SilkeySmooth: i bet its the vault
[8:49:41] xavier2119: torghast really isn't htat bad lmfao ya'
[8:49:41] Holysal: Damn great vault
[8:49:42] mavericks312: torgast is actually fun now
[8:49:44] BubbaChubbs420: all you guys saying Torghast is bad, have you tried a 5 star run? LuL
[8:49:48] Kisswani: Hunters are causing lag ... hunters disabled Kappa
[8:49:52] Mattsta: oh I forgot about the new world boss...does it go into rotation with the 9.0 world bosses or up every week?
[8:49:56] Timkoch02: I cant believe I took a half day, I should have figured I just wanted to watch the raid hype and see the end cinematic with all the hype
[8:49:58] Aidler: more like the Jailor demands too much rent for Torghast from Blizz…. naguuraSip
[8:50:16] OhNoNotAgain: @Timkoch02 Reasons why taking time off on a patch day is bold.
[8:50:20] purfessorplum: Is Tow meditating?
[8:50:20] MacAckerman: Im glad they never gave up pn Torghast and are actually trying to improve it unlike Warfronts and Islands
[8:50:26] xavier2119: @Timkoch02 i thought about doing that too. i would have just kept working though as soon as they kept pushing the servers back
[8:50:29] darkrowse21: i blame evil bert and elmo for extended maintence
[8:50:36] sile_n_ce: hi chat. is it us server?
[8:50:38] Aidler: @cannibaltrout no he sleeps
[8:50:44] Raaktor: Cause people wanna hate
[8:50:51] Timkoch02: @xavier2119 yea i should have done that
[8:51:03] purfessorplum: @Aidler lol gotta get it while you can waiting for these servers I guess
[8:51:05] Mattsta: @sile_n_ce he is on his EU acct atm
[8:51:06] mavericks312: wow community is just toxic ay this point
[8:51:09] shanedille: i think i got all the shoulders mogs already, its not offering me anymore lol
[8:51:11] Merex760: I like it a lot more. Can't wait for that sweet auto loot
[8:51:17] Dinermoe: i dont enjoy it but it doesnt feel liek a chore anymore
[8:51:18] Timkoch02: @OhNoNotAgain Well they did give me the option i just should have taken the option to leave early
[8:51:34] LukeTheGam3r: I wish blizz would bring back the mage tower
[8:51:34] dutchie76: sucks that we are being funneled into just the Maw and Korthia, and the other zones are eh now
[8:51:44] zein49: @Towelliee How long untill servers come up now?
[8:51:44] leatiebabe: @adonissteelflex i agree
[8:51:48] Malorne123: @Towelliee Do you think blizz intentionally releases incomplete system in order to complete them by the last patch of the expansion?
[8:51:51] purfessorplum: I'm out of the loop, do you actually earn things in boreghast now?
[8:51:52] Naturalbeef: 9.0 Torghast was the worst thing I’ve ever done in WoW. 9.1 Torghast is one of my favorite parts of the current content
[8:51:55] real_mangoat: getting rid of that eye is so good. I hate that bitch.

[8:52:25] ravensky93: Wow players are just spoiled kids nowadays
[8:52:27] zgag: @Towelliee Is there a reason why Blizzard doesn't start NA down time at around something like 2 -3 AM PT
[8:52:28] perssonsz: @Towelliee did you ever complete challenge mode in mists of pandaria ? if so what are your thoughts on it
[8:52:37] KingSpud91: Maintenance extended again.... 3PM(PDT)

[13:04:33] ProClicker: Phase 2 is a wild platform to platform fight
[13:05:26] Proliphic: it's a race, yeah. but it's looking like you just run counter clockwise and deal with adds as they come, deal with the tank buster and keep going
[13:05:31] DragonofWolves: RS_Iron_Jay no they havent, but its uo on wowhead if you want to spoil yourself
