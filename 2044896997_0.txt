[1:37:59] xiliketurtlex: two blue silk
[1:38:41] dimitridq: mes whats ur secondary dr addon
[1:38:59] sicmatesick09: my god blood ..
[1:39:04] wowsuomi: You in bdk shuffle q right now?
[1:39:10] ionlyplaymetas: do it for the content!
[1:39:23] wowsuomi: Yea
[1:40:01] americanmoses18: hellbloom one?
[1:40:17] americanmoses18: its 3 ilvls not that big
[1:40:36] dimitridq: 3 ilvl on weapon is a big deal
[1:40:40] wowsuomi: Does  the leggo have haste
[1:41:15] dimitridq: haste on bdk just lest you spam death strike so much
[1:41:20] dankgamer97: Mes, have we fallen this low.. playing blood in pvp ? monkaHmm
[1:41:23] ionlyplaymetas: without haste you have no runes, it feels really bad
[1:41:25] dankgamer97: jazggzOMEGAKEK
[1:41:43] dimitridq: plus there is an inherent dr on buffing your raw ap as tank its not like you are there to pump
[1:42:09] ionlyplaymetas: atleast in pve, you literally have no buttons to push and you just die in high content because runes are on CD. i imagine its the same in pve
[1:42:44] sunileif: go blood lord mes!
[1:43:09] anmusallam: Blood meta!
[1:43:25] xiliketurtlex: bloodzin has like 4000 haste
[1:43:30] ionlyplaymetas: sanguine enchant
[1:43:31] dimitridq: DR in the sense that you intrsically are tuned to do less damage as a tank, even if youre buffing your inherent ap, all youre really doing is going is maybe getting to the base damage of a mid dps
[1:43:38] ionlyplaymetas: on weapon is really important
[1:44:14] dankgamer97: HUH
[1:44:56] americanmoses18: weird ppl man
[1:44:56] xiliketurtlex: well ideally you want to blood boil as much to stack hemostasis buff
[1:45:04] xiliketurtlex: and it with death strike to deal big dmg
[1:45:45] xiliketurtlex: and you use murderous intent pvp talent
[1:45:49] kaoti_12: I dont understand the hate on blood dk they wouldn't be playing it If blizz stopped nerfing dks dps
[1:46:01] ppnova_: rune of sanguination too
[1:46:20] xiliketurtlex: murderous, llast dance and spell
[1:46:21] americanmoses18: dont get me wrong I hate tanks and mes for playing them but hey here we are gotta do wut u gotta do baby
[1:46:26] sunileif: the real reason armor was nerfed so tanks can pvp
[1:46:49] americanmoses18: yea tank pvp is the content all of wow players want
[1:46:52] dankgamer97: What's your armor btw in pvp btw ?
[1:47:00] sunileif: @americanmoses18 NODDERS
[1:47:05] dankgamer97: alot of btw there lol
[1:47:09] Xeliumimar: new meta over night lol
[1:47:25] xiliketurtlex: make sure to take hemostasis
[1:47:36] xiliketurtlex: thats the whole point of ds dmg
[1:47:48] americanmoses18: triill played bm so time for mes to bdl
[1:47:50] americanmoses18: bdk*
[1:48:20] sunileif: BoPA/gf1fDREKLfAcG9Z2HkF/BCJJBBSSLSIRiIhISikkAAAAAgkIJBRSTICAAQIJJJAAAA
[1:48:43] dimitridq: for the slow, not needed
[1:48:57] happyheals: just had a warrior sit in the beginning and die because I asked him to watch los
[1:49:19] happyheals: so a 3-3 instead of 4-2
[1:49:28] dimitridq: are you trying the bdk out?
[1:49:33] ionlyplaymetas: standing in your DnD is really important for bottom left blood talent tree (i forgot the name) thats why grip of the dead
[1:49:38] ppnova_: heart strike
[1:49:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[1:49:50] ppnova_: but you also just have a ton of dnd uptime as blood
[1:50:02] ionlyplaymetas: its your bone shield exploding
[1:50:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: DnD gives cleave up to 5 for blood
[1:50:17] ionlyplaymetas: check bottom left blood talent tree
[1:50:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: DnD also gives haste for theem
[1:50:42] ppnova_: yea shattering bone/unholy ground/sanguine ground
[1:50:44] dimitridq: isnt he getting the vers buff from dropping dnd
[1:51:06] dimitridq: i thought one of the talents gives like 6% vers
[1:51:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is an optional vers buff from consuming the proc
[1:51:10] dimitridq: or did they change that
[1:51:20] happyheals: it is that bloody stuff
[1:51:20] ppnova_: in the blood tree its just 6% dmg and healing
[1:51:28] ionlyplaymetas: verse buff of 8% for 6s when you get a free DnD proc
[1:51:58] sunileif: just need klink to heal you on his prot pal now
[1:52:27] sunileif: POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE  POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE  POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE  POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE POGGERWOBBLE
[1:52:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: A little haste for them is good, and they say from a PvE standpoint all the stats are close for blood
[1:53:11] dankgamer97: yolo
[1:53:26] anmusallam: How are you Mes
[1:53:37] IamWalnuts: cdew is playing against the blood dk team again right now
[1:53:37] dankgamer97: Might try bdk aswell, its fun to be a raidboss
[1:53:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Keeping those blood boils rolling, bone shield up, and save runic power for when you need heals... that's basically blood tanking

[1:55:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: dancing rune weapon is of course huge for them
[1:55:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: The blood 2 and 4 set are basically nice passives
[1:55:40] Xeliumimar: oof the bdk team just beat cdew lol
[1:55:52] ionlyplaymetas: blood DK
[1:56:04] DBMezzy: go bdk bro
[1:56:09] DBMezzy: show us
[1:56:09] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[1:56:25] DBMezzy: at least u pved
[1:56:33] sunileif: spam blood boil?
[1:56:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: vampiric blood can be useful but mostly it's DRW is the big button
[1:56:55] americanmoses18: dew blaming it on the drinking in q lols
[1:58:26] ionlyplaymetas: could always buy a verse/haste pvp ring, so you dont have to recraft and get more of both
[1:58:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: blood boil is free to use, has two charges, and it buffs death strike, so I always try to weave those in
[1:59:10] ionlyplaymetas: 8% verse buff from free DnD proc
[1:59:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah it can stack up some
[1:59:57] zhangbeihaiz: from the bone shield
[2:00:12] xiliketurtlex: boneshield
[2:00:24] ionlyplaymetas: bone shield ads 10% and DnD gives 5%
[2:00:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: with the talent, blood boil increases death strike damage and healing 8% up to 5 stacks, 40%
[2:01:08] xiliketurtlex: you want to keep blood boil to maintain hemostasis
[2:01:16] sunileif: all you need now is trill as combat and cdew fistweavin
[2:01:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: In general I never let it get that high in PvE, but like 2 or three stacks before each death strike is very nice
[2:01:19] xiliketurtlex: and with ds with it
[2:02:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: DRW is also a really big parry %, that might be important against melee
[2:02:47] jabzeffect: Ur team is drunk and soo cringe to watch 😅
[2:03:22] DBMezzy: @jabzeffect akroS
[2:03:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: When I saw blood run before in 3's, it didn't come close to healing as much as the healer, like it does in PvE
[2:03:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: That tells me there is a lot less uptime for death strikes, so that's going to be tricky
[2:04:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Timing is going to be huge for this
[2:04:48] DBMezzy: i tried, useless
[2:04:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Usually teams ignore the tank LUL
[2:04:58] DBMezzy: they playes fist bdk and something
[2:05:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: So yeah if they do ignore the tank then the peels with grips and death and decay snare are higher value
[2:05:54] saiyan333: not for a rank two lol
[2:06:34] DBMezzy: arms bdk mist on 2.4 couple weeks ago on eu
[2:06:52] DBMezzy: no idea
[2:07:05] DBMezzy: maybe + damage ?
[2:07:16] Dudewuut: ms value
[2:07:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: death's caress gives us bone shield at range now, very handy
[2:07:43] Szain3: DinoDance
[2:07:55] DBMezzy: i played double udk on that rofl
[2:07:57] DBMezzy: no chance
[2:08:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: 2 bone charges
[2:08:17] ionlyplaymetas: yea deaths caress is great to refresh stacks and not use 2 runes
[2:08:57] DBMezzy: they just sit on healer and gg
[2:09:34] xiliketurtlex: just try test without it
[2:09:49] xiliketurtlex: doest hurt to stack haste vers gem
[2:09:54] saiyan333: send me an order alt154 zamaki
[2:10:12] DBMezzy: that was time when wazz was on 2.5
[2:10:17] DBMezzy: those bdk were on 2.4

[2:12:07] avenueone: it can be linked servers
[2:12:16] avenueone: i could do frostmourne on jubei'thos
[2:12:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some things will be the same, using blood, it should bee fun
[2:12:29] ionlyplaymetas: oh no

[2:19:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: affliction things
[2:19:56] dimitridq: does anyone know if the cloth armor changes apply to warlock as a net gain or is it the same
[2:20:03] dimitridq: because locks feel like a menace
[2:21:00] shugguls: it worked out as the same
[2:21:16] dimitridq: kk
[2:22:25] shugguls: lock was already doing well but now they got more hp and there abilities scale off hp
[2:22:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the extra health made a number of specs more of a menace, like frost mage and boomkins
[2:27:41] xiliketurtlex: wonder if blood feast+spellwarden heals your team mate on magic dmg
[2:28:28] DBMezzy: @xiliketurtlex u already have the bdk ams that heals
[2:28:40] DBMezzy: looks more than enough dont u think
[2:28:59] DBMezzy: so much shit to test, blizz need to pay rofl
[2:29:07] xiliketurtlex: i know it heals you but does it actually heal team mate?
[2:29:20] xiliketurtlex: with ams on them?
[2:29:24] DBMezzy: i suppose yes
[2:29:36] ayewax: holy weakauras batman
[2:29:43] DBMezzy: 0 rounds rip mes
[2:31:59] dankgamer97: If only you were blood, would have been 6-0 EZ
[2:32:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: We're going to see 6-0 blood soon!
[2:33:04] dankgamer97: affli looks busted HUH
[2:33:53] dimitridq: solo is gonna be rough mes, people have a hard time playing with a tank on their side
[2:34:36] dimitridq: they should, also go healer every game as tank

[2:34:53] dimitridq: in my humble opinion
[2:35:02] michaelss_: just did a blood solo and went 5/1 at 2k mmr
[2:35:06] michaelss_: kinda fun honestly
[2:35:32] michaelss_: biggest death strike was 153k
[2:35:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: awesome
[2:35:54] dimitridq: no clue tbh, but i did a bm shuffle and it felt like we were doing muuuch better when tank was the focus
[2:35:57] dimitridq: i mean healer not tank
[2:36:03] michaelss_: sorry 190k normal hit
[2:36:05] michaelss_: DS
[2:36:11] dimitridq: something you will have to find out on your own
[2:36:39] dimitridq: also the logistics are probably different for bdk
[2:36:39] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[2:36:42] dimitridq: yeah
[2:36:49] sunileif: bm is beast mastery
[2:36:56] sunileif: brew master is brew
[2:37:08] dimitridq: bm is bad manners
[2:37:17] dimitridq: brew master is beast mastery
[2:37:28] sunileif: its true thats why you dont play beast mastery
[2:37:38] Healzbro: hey mes im trying to figure out how to make a weak aura that highlights the party frame when  someone gets dueled.
[2:37:41] Healzbro: can you help?
[2:37:42] dimitridq: lmao
[2:38:22] michaelss_: do you have a havoc WA mes?
[2:38:34] michaelss_: when a lock puts havoc up*^
[2:49:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not sure what the stat priority should be for blood, it could be that haste is very valuable
[2:51:00] sunileif: D;
[2:52:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: looks like top solo shuffle blood DK in NA is running about 32% haste, but the #2 guy only has 17% haste
[2:53:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: They all seem to have between 25-28% vers, and a bunch of mastery
[2:54:00] StreamElements: sous vide just donated $6.90 mesWeckso mesWeckso mesDad

[2:55:06] xiliketurtlex: true stat values
[2:55:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: So it looks like the question for blood is between haste and mastery, none of them are running crit at all
[2:55:34] dimitridq: well how did it go

[3:47:37] Cybernytez: the bdk literally just prevented the enemys to get to the firemage while the mage did unhealable dam

[3:50:48] dawsonator171: and 100k is still about 10% of an hp bar
[3:50:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Consumption is kind of an option
[3:51:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Consumption is kind of like a free death strike

[3:52:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: blood worms are alright, they do a little damage and some heal to them
[3:52:50] wowsuomi: Last time i heared blood worms was when u were leveling in wrath
[3:53:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would say blood worms are optional, not absolutely necessary
[3:53:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Consumption can be a saving thing if you are out of runic power
[3:53:50] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[3:54:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: They use purg in PvE
[3:54:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pretty much, there isn't much difference in any builds people make for blood
[3:55:46] happyheals: bloodworms
[3:55:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: They don't use foul bulwark either, but I think it is optional
[3:56:45] happyheals: you kinda have everyone on top of you the whole game already
[3:58:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah consumption has low damage, but it's free to use every 30 seconds
[3:58:32] dawsonator171: Heals you
[3:58:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't know if blood feast can heal a teammate
[3:58:50] dawsonator171: should we cook in 2s?
[3:59:20] dawsonator171: We aren't 2sin to win, we are talking about 2sing to test.
[4:01:04] dawsonator171: looks like 3% physical
[4:01:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: In theory if the blood shield never gets used up, that extra armor doesn't matter much
[4:01:59] shugguls: Bk arms rdruid should be solid
[4:02:21] shugguls: i play arms and need cope
[4:02:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: This build looks pretty good to me. Relish in blood is the only thing I might consider
[4:03:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: relish in blood is more runic power from the crimson scourge procs, when they are used
[4:03:10] jasonkbkt: 10m blood dk rbg
[4:03:47] wyldeshock: morning everybody
[4:03:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: crimson scourge has been a thorn in my side for years, RNG off auto attacks, so it is questionable value in important times but usually fires off a fair amount
[4:05:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: For PvE they say to keep a death and decay down all the time regardless of crimson scourge procs
[4:05:58] DontDv8: solo logic, 6-0 = 25cr, 1-5 = -58cr
[4:06:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: For PvP it's quite a bit harder with all the movement
[4:06:33] dawsonator171: you play grip of the dead for the big slow with it, so it's not horrible.
[4:07:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that grip of the dead is alright

[4:07:41] dawsonator171: I want to try soul reaper with this build
[4:07:54] dawsonator171: because of the 4 set.
[4:08:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: One of the finesse issues for me in blood is when to marrowrend, I tend to waste globals overcapping on bones
[4:09:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was wondering if anyone uses soul reaper in PvP
[4:09:09] dawsonator171: played a round where I got trained by a bm and warrior. all i pressed was marrowrend if felt like. shattering bones was 22% of my dam.
[4:10:10] dawsonator171: it procs ashen. so I'd play it ove zone cuz im selfish as hell.
[4:10:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah using both abom limb and soul reaper would give the tier set a little more value
[4:10:34] dawsonator171: wow I can't read.
[4:11:14] artsskeit: kill the spider
[4:11:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: If you can time that soul reaper right, it looks like big dam
[4:11:54] dawsonator171: I just deleted teh message. it made my brain hurt.
[4:12:04] dawsonator171: I have very few cells left.
[4:13:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was some kind of exploded message LUL
[4:14:14] artsskeit: im still voting for a spider on the keyboard

[4:22:25] LongSnapper99: So are blood DK super busted in PvP currently? I been seeing a few in solo shuffle recently.
[4:23:08] happyheals: My druid with a strong record in solo shuffle had some people doing shady things and afking certain rounds against other people. It caused me to go 2-4 one tiome and that was the only time I have lost. I am hard stuck at 1520 and am getting 1 point a win going 4-2
[4:23:25] happyheals: leavers and afkers out of spite in games
[4:24:00] happyheals: last 2 matches I went 4-2 and 4-2 and got +1 +1
[4:24:09] jasonkbkt: Damn that sucks
[4:24:35] happyheals: I have been winning so it is bullshit
[4:24:35] jasonkbkt: Those lower ratings are a nightmare
[4:24:37] walkenpvp: you playing rbgs or arena
[4:25:10] happyheals: I just need to do 2v2 and 3v3
[4:25:33] walkenpvp: oh just playing shuffle?
[4:25:35] happyheals: oh no, not you. I mean on my druid in general lol
[4:25:46] walkenpvp: whats your mmr boss
[4:26:03] walkenpvp: nice 2k is sweet
[4:26:10] DontDv8: low rating solo healing is like 80% 3-3 i swear
[4:26:22] vibesham: 2k mmr is too crowded i imagine
[4:26:24] jasonkbkt: Last pop was a tease
[4:26:34] walkenpvp: goodluck boss
[4:26:40] Szain3: DinoDance
[4:26:55] happyheals: I went 6-0 5-1 all the way to 1400, then I had 1 game where 2 people argued and afk lost the games with each other
[4:27:24] dawsonator171: I'm surprised I don't get more AFKers or leavers. tons of trash talking about me playing blood every lobby.
[4:27:25] happyheals: was 2-2 and then one dude just afked the last 2 on my team so I went 2-4
[4:27:49] happyheals: since that I have just sat at rating even though I am winning every time
[4:28:04] dawsonator171: I'
[4:28:09] dawsonator171: at game start
[4:28:16] vibesham: @happyheals And that's the reason why one shouldn't care about ss at all :S
[4:28:26] dawsonator171: why blood, are you special, do you have a life, is there something wrong with you etc.

[4:28:51] vibesham: with enough games you'll get there eventually
[4:29:02] vibesham: it's just frustrating yeah
[4:29:05] happyheals: my 2's is a little under 2k and I think it was like 2.1k mmr
[4:29:17] dawsonator171: we are at 1700 mmr. not having the most success, but I haven't played blood in the least bit since probably WoD.
[4:29:52] happyheals: people were nice to me on my blood dk, they talked trash to the other dps
[4:30:30] Malte_L: he didnt take dmg when you asm
[4:30:45] vibesham: doesnt show absorb on raid frames either i think

[4:44:52] Makiaveli88: damge prevented?
[4:44:58] xiliketurtlex: right click on top of detail
[4:45:14] rembrandt89: or maybe it’s damage prevented
[4:45:34] Makiaveli88: top of healing absorbved
[4:45:39] rembrandt89: 2nd to rig hhr column
[4:45:44] rembrandt89: right **
[4:46:18] Machina89: maybe overhealing
[4:46:38] dankgamer97: just realized ppl watching will prob wanna try blood now, will shuffle be infested with blood dks now ? jazggzK
[4:46:46] Machina89: it did 23k
[4:46:50] Machina89: in overhealing it showed
[4:46:55] Machina89: way bottom
[4:47:22] Machina89: you talkin about blood feast right
[4:47:36] Machina89: it did in overhealing
[4:47:39] Machina89: its separate from ams
[4:47:52] Machina89: weird i saw it when you clicked it
[4:47:55] xiliketurtlex: click it make it bigger
[4:48:03] Machina89: very bottom
[4:48:43] Siechtum: hi hi bisscuHI
[4:50:02] dawsonator171: fyrakk weapon is averaging about 6% of my dam in each game, but I'm also lining up the on use.
[4:50:20] dawsonator171: I also only have like 9% haste. which is shit.
[4:50:28] stockbridge10: gl
[4:50:40] nooahww: its clawing any good atm?
[4:50:47] nooahww: what do u think?
[4:51:23] latenightsuckmeright: is this sod or HC classic?
[4:51:37] Disemble: @stockbridge10 are u from stockbridge lol
[4:52:57] dawsonator171: no. that is fixed now it seems.
[4:53:11] Pheanixx68: you plan on playing Cata classic at all Mes?
[4:53:13] dawsonator171: it did last week, but not with the changes this week.
[4:53:44] dawsonator171: yeah. biggest hit so far is 138k crit.
[4:54:06] dawsonator171: but I think I was rather sauced when I pulled that off.
[4:54:32] dawsonator171: Average I'm hitting for big hit is about 60k-70k
[4:55:34] Pwnyo808: idk what a good way to not tilt is man
[4:55:34] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[4:55:44] asdkl2312k3o: ye I think blood can be good
[4:55:49] asdkl2312k3o: if u got leggy axe too
[4:55:56] simszszy: PogChamp
[4:55:56] Pwnyo808: i tilt so fucking hard queueing SS sometimes.  Haven't played BM in ages, decided to queue it immediately go 0-6
[4:55:57] Pwnyo808: lol
[4:56:23] dawsonator171: thoughts on Mike Ibarra leaving?
[4:56:31] Pwnyo808: i could've come back pretty well but one round the DK runs across the map and dies before healer is out of sap
[4:56:36] Pwnyo808: and then another round mage does the same thing
[4:56:40] dawsonator171: Ybarra*
[4:56:43] Pwnyo808: so i go 3-3 instead of 5-1 /cry
[4:57:41] xiliketurtlex: blood feast does heal alot against wizard
[4:57:45] xiliketurtlex: mine did 200k
[4:57:49] avenueone: canned by microsoft
[4:57:58] asdkl2312k3o: ye I think so too
[4:58:02] asdkl2312k3o: he played the game even
[4:58:05] dawsonator171: My thought is that his position expired.
[4:58:11] Seventhedeadly: 100% accurate
[4:58:20] Seventhedeadly: I would totally agree with that
[4:59:29] Seventhedeadly: I don't think so.. because he worked for MS before hand and then came to Blizzard.. and then the merger took place and then, his position was eliminated.
[4:59:50] theodeth: most people don't know what a golden parachute is, nice to know you do
[4:59:51] Pwnyo808: MS is buying activision for the hardware (servers) more so than the actual games i think
[4:59:57] Pwnyo808: idk if Ybarra had anything to do with that
[5:01:00] chrisshockerx: Is blood spec the way for pvp on retail right now for dks?
[5:01:03] StarShopping95: YEP
[5:01:07] theodeth: yes, the whole point of a merge is to realize synergizes (aka layofffs)
[5:01:17] Pwnyo808: when a takeover happens there's duplicates of almost every possition, so theyr'e going to get rid of it
[5:01:32] Seventhedeadly: Plus Im sure having to pay bobby that  400 mil didn't help either
[5:01:42] asdkl2312k3o: if they paid lower I think they wouldnt get it
[5:02:05] Pwnyo808: nah you can't shit on the guy for that
[5:02:07] theodeth: we don't know who was laid off
[5:02:12] happyheals: pretty sure I just got a win trading lobby
[5:02:23] Seventhedeadly: But, it wasn't just Bliz either.. I mean the whole gaming industry as a whole, is doing layoffs.
[5:02:24] Pwnyo808: how do we know he actually didn't leave for a very good reason
[5:02:24] dawsonator171: When Parker took over Clarcor and our facility, the position of our president had a time duration during the merger. Once the merger was successful his position no longer had necessity and was therefore eliminated. I believe this was the same situation.
[5:02:44] Pwnyo808: @dawsonator171 that's what i'm saying
[5:02:54] happyheals: 1 dps on my team literally did nothing all 6 rounds
[5:03:04] asdkl2312k3o: this infiltration shit is 2head take, how do u expect one person to rise to president of a company
[5:03:06] dawsonator171: Mes for Blizzard President. no Cap.
[5:03:07] asdkl2312k3o: KEKW
[5:03:10] Pwnyo808: i doubt he was supposed to be there for a long time, if a company like microsoft buys activision, why wouldn't they use their leadership teal to run iti
[5:03:15] asdkl2312k3o: if anything he didnt want to work for MS again
[5:03:34] Pwnyo808: you just need the guy to hold the sword when people get cut, then the position expires so the bigger company doesn't get the big blame
[5:03:51] happyheals: not Bobby's Yacht
[5:04:51] wyldeshock: who are you talking about and what was his position
[5:04:58] dawsonator171: Missionary
[5:05:00] happyheals: multi dollar
[5:05:05] theodeth: we're all hybrid now
[5:05:08] Pwnyo808: companies not wanting people to work from home is literally because having that many people working remote is a huge liability factor
[5:05:13] theodeth: - amazon
[5:05:13] happyheals: Small indie company
[5:05:26] asdkl2312k3o: the merger wasnt 100%
[5:05:30] dawsonator171: Seemed like a straight forward kind of guy, keep them on their back and do business face to face.
[5:05:34] asdkl2312k3o: it could have been blocked easily and almost was
[5:06:01] GLYFEnation: Ya'll talking about whos gonna be the new president?
[5:06:08] Pwnyo808: it's honestly a miracle that wow still exists at all
[5:06:17] GLYFEnation: Of blizard yes...
[5:06:19] GLYFEnation: lol
[5:06:21] dawsonator171: Metzen overthrew Ybarra
[5:06:24] GLYFEnation: blizzard*
[5:06:34] GLYFEnation: Yes.
[5:06:40] Yukimes: ill be come president of blizzard and nerf chillstreak
[5:06:40] asdkl2312k3o: tbh I dont think anything changes for now. Does the president even have an effect on the game?
[5:06:48] happyheals: It has a lot of potential Revenue that has yet to be fully engaged
[5:07:07] Seventhedeadly: I was really worried about Metzen and Holly's status.
[5:07:14] GLYFEnation: Mike Ybarra's shoes will be hard to fill.
[5:07:22] Siechtum: hoping for the best
[5:07:24] GLYFEnation: They g otta have someone
[5:07:26] Yukimes: does he have big feet?
[5:07:28] asdkl2312k3o: @notmes I think those under him now has bigger say
[5:07:29] dawsonator171: People need someone to call Daddy.
[5:07:32] asdkl2312k3o: might not be bad at all
[5:07:39] saiyan333: I'm more concerned about Adhams position
[5:07:51] saiyan333: dude was there from the start
[5:07:53] happyheals: World of Warcraft Classic on XBOX
[5:07:56] Seventhedeadly: I thought Adham got let go?
[5:08:08] Pwnyo808: yeah retail has a shelf life because of it's cost
[5:08:10] happyheals: start the game from the beginning and play it all the way through
[5:08:12] GLYFEnation: I think the bigger question is do we still need 2 wow directors? Ion Hazzikostas or Metzen? Does one get fired
[5:08:13] Pwnyo808: but idk if classic can exist without it
[5:08:17] saiyan333: ybarra and adham in a single day
[5:08:26] asdkl2312k3o: @notmes retail earns them a lot of money from the store though

[5:09:14] dawsonator171: guys. Mes is currently under an NDA and cannot announce that he is the new Blizzard President.
[5:09:44] asdkl2312k3o: ye but they also lost a lot of devs after the scandal
[5:09:47] Pwnyo808: @notmes i think Ybarra's price-cost model didn't work very well, and that's part of the reason he's not there
[5:09:48] dawsonator171: And if he tells you no, it's because of the NDA.
[5:09:50] asdkl2312k3o: and had trouble hiring
[5:09:56] happyheals: If we get an animated series or invest in offshoot games that use the storyline.
[5:10:14] happyheals: HOTS on XBOX
[5:10:19] asdkl2312k3o: nah but at the time
[5:10:20] happyheals: OW on XBOX
[5:10:21] saiyan333: I thought they brought that other studio over to work on the Surv game?
[5:10:21] dawsonator171: Riot also had a big layoff too, it's kind of hitting the industry hard atm.
[5:10:29] Pwnyo808: @notmes a ton are HR, because microsoft has HR, why would activision keep HR
[5:10:30] GLYFEnation: Microsoft is a safe bet tho naw? They own ESO also.
[5:11:00] asdkl2312k3o: ye but thats mostly on the companies, not the market. They dont provide good games to their customers
[5:11:09] dawsonator171: You always keep a local HR for each place Pwnyo, and it needs to be able to support the facility.
[5:11:20] happyheals: Microsoft gained player access which is key
[5:11:36] GLYFEnation: debatable.
[5:11:49] Seventhedeadly: Maybe they wanted to just rip the bandaid quickly
[5:11:52] Yoskexz: peepoRiot why wont this blood q pop peepoRiot
[5:11:54] asdkl2312k3o: but most roles were CS, marketing etc which they probably want to fill themselves
[5:11:57] Pwnyo808: @notmes they're going to use activision to drive people to their other products
[5:12:16] dawsonator171: Why won't my blood queue pop, I am at pleb ratings.
[5:12:46] Pwnyo808: @notmes they're making a huge acquisition in a down market, they're going to be able to cripple competition at some point because of the resources they acquired
[5:12:51] Yoskexz: @dawsonator171 i knew u were about it monkaHmm
[5:12:55] Pwnyo808: it's a good move by them, they just have to weather the storm
[5:12:58] saiyan333: I've learned first had that mergers and acquisitions are never in the smaller guys benefit....
[5:13:34] happyheals: they buy at a high price then claim losses that can carry forward 7 years
[5:13:46] Pwnyo808: Right, but microsoft doesn't care at all, it's about assets and people.  They have a bigger playerbase now, which is going to help them (microsoft)
[5:13:58] dawsonator171: @Yoskexz trying to get mes some legendary data points, not that it's immediately useful, or useful at all.
[5:14:07] Pwnyo808: i doubt their end game is to keep the games on the activision suite the same
[5:14:28] Yoskexz: do u play death chain?
[5:14:45] GLYFEnation: How many artery employees got axed tho?
[5:14:53] happyheals: knowing the stock market is basically in a depression but being artificially kept afloat. Buying something like that may have been a good choice for them
[5:15:05] dawsonator171: I think you would play death chain and gorefiend's with a big 1 shot MM hunter.
[5:15:10] Yoskexz: death chain is just transfer dmg right or isit 20% bonus dmg
[5:15:10] asdkl2312k3o: They also laid of 100 employees from survival game where it was developed for 6 years and no demo
[5:15:10] dawsonator171: JS Yoske
[5:15:26] asdkl2312k3o: and I mean blizz showed bad leadership with the engine decisions in that case too
[5:15:38] asdkl2312k3o: so they prolly want to stop the bleeding in some parts too
[5:15:38] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:15:43] saiyan333: Typically when the buyer doesn't have the ability to write off loses to make their money back is when you start seeing major changes.
[5:15:56] happyheals: the worst move Blizz made was changing my Boo Alexstrasza's look
[5:16:01] happyheals: It just aint right
[5:16:05] dawsonator171: 20% of all damage taken to also be received by others in the chain @Yoskexz
[5:16:46] Chillinar: bdk meta?
[5:16:46] xiliketurtlex: most healing done against lock and mage with blood feast is like 400k
[5:16:59] Pwnyo808: @Yoskexz i think you shit on me in an RBG last night, EOTs?
[5:17:24] dawsonator171: so if you're trickshots and explo shotting with the one shot build it could be complete chaos. Could also be really really good with the BM stomp one shot build.
[5:17:47] Yoskexz: @Pwnyo808 possibly i spam yolos alot for cq
[5:18:37] Pwnyo808: @Yoskexz yeah it was EOTs, i was playing MM and god damn i couldn't do anything
[5:18:38] Pwnyo808: lol
[5:19:02] Yoskexz: WTF
[5:20:25] Pwnyo808: @Yoskexz what do you think is best for SS?  is BM just the only good hunter spec?
[5:21:22] Yoskexz: @Pwnyo808 bm > sv > mm for ss
[5:22:19] Pwnyo808: @Yoskexz yeah SV felt like cancer to play tho.  but i think i jsut cheesed MM opener so i climbed fast
[5:23:31] olihob: is blood actually good?
[5:24:27] adventxcloud: we're on smolderon, lemme know if you want in for fyrakk
[5:25:13] Yoskexz: i feel like aug kinda slaps
[5:25:23] dawsonator171: I think you should take a shot at fyrakk on warr so we can play the comp with double leggo.

[5:28:24] Talason: why did they nerf mes's armor
[5:28:36] Thedruidtyler: ngl if i was in a tank lobby id instant leave its just makes the game so much worse
[5:28:56] dawsonator171: because mes is a bully and also refuses to play feral @Talason
[5:29:00] Talason: supa made a video complaining about blood dk
[5:29:05] Yoskexz: seems like u wud get value everytime u use it on the blind

[5:29:50] Yoskexz: @kickboxer32xd i wonder why LUL
[5:30:15] dawsonator171: mes did you see advent's message?
[5:30:46] Talason: mag was raging on stream about it
[5:30:51] dawsonator171: mes, I think if you got the legendary on warrior we could run this comp for fun after AWC season.
[5:30:52] Talason: for like an hour straight
[5:31:14] Talason: abour war being bad
[5:31:20] Talason: about*

[5:33:56] dawsonator171: could just delete affliction and solve that problem there.
[5:34:56] Malte_L: Ret also needs ms Keepo just give everyone a ms. just make healing worse baseline 4Head
[5:35:08] Yukimes: season 4 of every xpac should be silly season  give us corruption vendors
[5:35:15] asdkl2312k3o: nah they just need another school of magic they can use that does decent dmg while ur locked
[5:36:33] heho1231: is blood dk gross in pvp ?

[5:37:23] Yoskexz: im more shocked at the aug popping off
[5:38:19] Yoskexz: can u check aug breakdown
[5:38:51] vuldronx: think now would be a perfect time to unnerf AMS and death strike with the armor nerfs and necrotic wound nerfs
[5:38:59] heho1231: i was playing it in m+ and was surprised how much single target dam it does
[5:39:16] dawsonator171: rune weapon resets are insane.
[5:40:06] Mythh_93: @yukimes streaming blood dk Aug resto when HeyGuys

[5:40:50] Yukimes: ye boi!
[5:41:30] dawsonator171: I'm not entirely surprised by blood being good, because their dam in PVE is high. I wonder about brewmaster because they are also high damage tanks.
[5:41:35] xiliketurtlex: its normally eon into upheavel then eruption
[5:41:45] xiliketurtlex: sometimes upheavel crits big
[5:42:34] Yoskexz: is blood cdew approved or do u have to hit him with the " oh no im blood this game "

[6:36:54] Pwnyo808: lol
[6:37:41] figurines: Why people say that? SS is like the most popular pvp mode ever. It's full of flaws and issues. yet still dominates play metrics. I hope they keep improving it
[6:38:32] Pwnyo808: some nights it feels better and gives more satisfaction to not queue Ss and just sit the rating thatn to queue and tank

[6:40:06] 123boom: hi i just started watching will i have neough time to get the drop before you close the stream today ?
[6:40:08] magic_pat: i think they are full leaning into pvp being aids to get into
[6:40:40] ItsGraavi: @magic_pat Need to run it to the ground so they can build it back up without any old pvp players left to complain Kappa
[6:40:55] thunderxmvp: I get it, the invetion of SS has made me almost stop playing the game, healer main so SS is so toxic for me and finding partners for 3s is harder and the ladder more deflated because everyone is in shuffle
[6:41:36] magic_pat: id pref if SS was just 1 match and done
[6:42:26] sunileif: solo q should hav eno rewards other than conquest
[6:42:54] ItsGraavi: The biggest problem with solo shuffle are the q times. Bad games wouldnt feel as bad if you didnt need to wait 30 minutes for them.
[6:43:05] Pwnyo808: solos would be fine, but they need to make a system like hearthstone
[6:43:17] Pwnyo808: where if you hit a certain rating, you can't drop back down to encourage people to play
[6:43:18] sunileif: and ig vault items. it should only be for catch up gear essentially
[6:43:19] Pwnyo808: rather than sit
[6:43:23] Wondernoobx: I think shuffle needs full rewards, including recolor of glad mount
[6:43:50] sunileif: fuck that solo q is a blight on pvp
[6:44:04] acidtrip1312: hello good sir, do you think phdk is in a good state or cupid would be better atm?
[6:44:16] magic_pat: its never going back i think
[6:44:35] magic_pat: solo is more accessible for the avg joe, most ppl in previous xpacs sat in lfg for like 8 hrs
[6:44:37] ItsGraavi: Solo q is a can of worms that you cant close once its been opened
[6:45:28] Pwnyo808: @magic_pat that's true
[6:45:49] sunileif: @magic_pat you hold players to a low bar they will never be good. you are part of the problem lfr is prolly your favourite way to raid
[6:46:49] sunileif: then they try normal and its 'too hard. why cant i just zug zug w"
[6:47:08] Wondernoobx: most people will never be good period. That's just a fact. They deserve to have fun too
[6:47:31] Dudewuut: @sunileif super tox for a mod ngl
[6:47:57] ItsGraavi: Yeah but there needs to be rewards for getting good as well
[6:48:01] Wondernoobx: arena was dead af before SS. I had an hour queues at 1800 mmr in season 4 of shadowlands
[6:48:13] sunileif: toxic? im saying players in general are better than you think?
[6:48:16] thepartyzone: just started grind dh ele on na feels absolutely insane

[6:48:38] fwankey: lol 󠀀
[6:48:54] magic_pat: what does being good have to do with anything lol

[10:05:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shadow priest could go well with blood DK
[10:05:52] Begasaur: Still playing blood i see
[10:06:04] NaraliHS: Theres a bugged interaction where Death Chain on Ult Sac Hpal kills them instantly but they dont play ult sac anymore these days
[10:06:19] NaraliHS: It just feeds infinite damage on itself with sac dam
[10:06:20] nikthevoker: i liked boomy just for the cc/on demand dam, bnut could prolly just get run over while trying to set it up LUL
[10:06:27] Blaze150000: pvp talents strang/decomp/ dancing runeweapon ?
[10:06:37] zachgamegodx: did u look at the vod io linked mes
[10:06:45] nikthevoker: what is death chains

[10:07:50] IamWalnuts: whats the mmr gotten to for blood now
[10:08:02] Bronloch: do you have talent copy paste commands?
[10:08:04] NaraliHS: Realistically you only swap out Spellwarden some games for walking dead/taunt/strang
[10:08:15] zachgamegodx: isnt set just ashen decay which is 5% dmg reduction 10% dmg amp
[10:08:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: necrotic aura seems alright for a caster partner
[10:08:35] nikthevoker: what was the interaction for fire breath and deathchains?
[10:08:43] Blaze150000: murderous
[10:09:26] tommysalameee: more people playing blood then frost ☠️☠️☠️
[10:09:31] zachgamegodx: ah ye would love to link us omething sooner but they're private peoples
[10:09:49] WagwanBombaClatBomba: Blizzard fakt up the tuning so bad that the tank spec does more dmg then the dmg spec jazggzLaugh
[10:09:55] tommysalameee: how would you fix frost??
[10:09:56] zachgamegodx: he's still a great guy to look at on armory
[10:10:03] zachgamegodx: wagwan faced it the other day right @WagwanBombaClatBomba
[10:10:03] NaraliHS: @nikthevoker Not heard of an interaction between those spells, its just good burst
[10:10:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: To me it's crazy to see a tank with competitive damage, that basically never happens
[10:10:12] zachgamegodx: while he was boosting lontar and evo
[10:10:15] NaraliHS: But ult sac on death chain is bugged
[10:10:24] stockbridge10: gl
[10:10:28] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @zachgamegodx jazggzOMEGAKEK

[10:10:42] DinGuu_: frost
[10:11:01] nikthevoker: no i thought someone said there was bugged interacton, but i cant remember 5min ago
[10:11:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: They nerfed the hell out of guardian druid when it was doing enough damage to cause problems LUL
[10:11:31] Blaze150000: can u link your specc plz ?
[10:11:32] NaraliHS: @nikthevoker The only bugged interaction I know about is pala sac
[10:11:38] sunileif: but your are the chosen one pagan lord mes
[10:11:41] zachgamegodx: @WagwanBombaClatBomba what tank comp did u face i forget
[10:11:43] zachgamegodx: was it blood?
[10:11:56] WagwanBombaClatBomba: blood arms fist

[10:12:16] zachgamegodx: hahaha
[10:12:19] zachgamegodx: did they win?
[10:12:20] WagwanBombaClatBomba: blood top single target dmg by miles
[10:12:31] WagwanBombaClatBomba: ye i cant do shit
[10:12:33] zachgamegodx: oh bc of the epts
[10:12:45] zachgamegodx: 1v9 waga
[10:12:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think blood and vengeance are probably the two tanks with the best chances, vengeance has been doing top tank dam
[10:12:53] zachgamegodx: cant do more
[10:12:55] zachgamegodx: nothing important
[10:13:04] WagwanBombaClatBomba: go next
[10:13:08] WagwanBombaClatBomba: jazggzOMEGAKEK
[10:13:42] Blaze150000: what wepon enchant u play ?
[10:13:43] zachgamegodx: i need to find the copy pasta where he says "1v9 is faking unreal, go next, i cant do more"
[10:13:48] OlimaruTV: I like tank specs but I heard and read a lot that people don't like that in pvp. Is that still a thing?
[10:13:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Next season when guardian gets the good season 2 tier set, maybe it can come back
[10:13:53] wyldeshock: I never play mage but imma lvl and gear one. which spec should I play? don’t like frost
[10:14:01] Blaze150000: sanguination ?
[10:14:27] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @zachgamegodx think u type !drainerx in his twitch
[10:14:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: @OlimaruTV Oh yeah, tanks are generally despised in PvP LUL
[10:15:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember the AWC when a lot of Brewmasters showed up, viewers loved it and players hated it
[10:15:33] sunileif: @OlimaruTV cept when runnign the flag

[10:17:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the smart teams are going to CC during dancing rune weapon, so that PvP talent for it is going to help
[10:17:51] Blaze150000: u play empowered runeweapon ?
[10:19:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't know what other strategies people are going to come up with to fight blood, it could just be a lot of kiting
[10:20:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Disarm is brutal for us, since we can't use death strike during it, that might be something
[10:21:05] timmah25: change the shatter bone into casters too?
[10:21:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: The one IBF talent does give a damage reduction with it, not sure how needed that is tho
[10:21:33] timmah25: does it proc tho from them
[10:21:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Thee lichbourne talent, that's what I wass thinking of
[10:21:48] NaraliHS: I'm surprised you dont play gorefiend its a huge cd but an extra kick is nice
[10:21:55] waitimdesyncd: gorefiend maybe for a little extra grip in long games where you might get it twice
[10:22:18] omkar3108: PogChamp

[10:38:03] SoraSkyforge: i jsut die
[10:38:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: boomy DH is a tough comp to wrangle
[10:40:30] waitimdesyncd: the shufflebot

[10:40:51] sunileif: 2bdk rdu would beat all

[10:44:34] Chillinar: can't wait to see bdk in awc next week
[10:44:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: I agree there is something broken with this spec
[10:44:38] Blaze150000: wanna try bdk for fun with affli lock, should i go with necro aura for him?
[10:44:57] Rhilly23: Rhilly23 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! 37 long amazing  months love ya buddy
[10:44:57] StreamElements: Rhilly23 just subscribed for 37 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[10:45:01] sunileif: by that logic rogues would be nerfed more
[10:45:03] Xeliumimar: so is BDK free glad right now LOL
[10:45:11] mayfire15: yall going to actually try it?
[10:45:11] papagoog: if they dont out right remove tanks i feel like they should do a partial rework to the way they work specifically in arena
[10:45:32] nikthevoker: if you want to try it ini 3s im down LUL
[10:45:43] waitimdesyncd: @Xeliumimar  not quite, bm hunter still exists LUL
[10:45:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure in 3's with coordination it will work better
[10:46:12] Rhilly23: does it do damage
[10:46:19] ryanblue98: cdwe said he mentioned blood a few times and you ignored him all day Kappa  as if you hated the idea
[10:46:26] Rhilly23: or just their for utility
[10:47:03] Thingyy: Thingyy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! hey
[10:47:03] StreamElements: Thingyy just subscribed for 26 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[10:47:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's really neat to watch someone learn a new spec and do well with it
[10:47:36] mayfire15: well you are a main dk
[10:47:41] Xeliumimar: is it like unholy though
[10:47:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Well, the basics of being a DK are the same with blood, yes
[10:47:56] mayfire15: def helps
[10:47:56] NaraliHS: The thing is blood DK is just scuffed unholy/frost with more deathgrip and durability but less dam
[10:48:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's less ghouls and that DRW cooldown is something else
[10:48:22] NaraliHS: So you dont need so much practice I feel like
[10:48:28] Zilesky: Mes how are WW monks ? I feel like your the best at explaining the why
[10:49:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah tombstone can be one of the highest blood damage abilitiers
[10:49:15] mayfire15: you think blood wants to play with melee?
[10:49:38] Rhilly23: what comp do you do with blood
[10:49:47] Xeliumimar: maybe blood dk demo lock x is good
[10:49:52] Blaze150000: wait can u explain me tombstone what it does
[10:49:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah tombstone consumes bone charges, and each bone consumed reduces the DRW cooldown
[10:50:01] starskedc: Ew
[10:50:11] Rhilly23: ok cool
[10:50:31] biofreaks: BM Hunter / Blood
[10:50:31] manyforless: gonna be so bad for the game if u end up playing a tank comp in awc
[10:50:36] Blaze150000: ahh tombestone after DRW
[10:50:39] starskedc: The game feels so cut and dry
[10:50:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dancing Rune Weapon is such a huge cooldown for blood damage, maximizing that is awesome
[10:50:55] SoraSkyforge: ANOTHER 0-6 LETS GO
[10:50:57] SoraSkyforge: AHJHAHAAHA
[10:50:59] SoraSkyforge: FROM 2.6 TO 2.1
[10:51:00] SuperSunBros64: If hes playing tank in AWC hes not telling us here right now lol
[10:51:00] SoraSkyforge: NICEEEEEE
[10:51:10] mayfire15: lol so many people have played tank in awc. i dont see why it would be so bad this time
[10:51:26] panjack13: what would a tank comp look like?
[10:51:42] panjack13: if people in chat know
[10:51:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood could definitely be used in some counter comps, I think
[10:52:07] panjack13: interesting
[10:52:22] panjack13: I haven’t played my tank in PvP since the changes, might have to see how it feels
[10:52:23] Xeliumimar: RMP doesnt stand a chance into blood dk lol
[10:52:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: I need to see how blood does into RMP, for sure
[10:52:52] panjack13: my experience against blood DK in rbg has been that they are immortal
[10:53:12] papagoog: i feel like blood is actualy gonna die into rmp
[10:53:42] panjack13: excited to watch aww
[10:53:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: RMP could give blood very little uptime, and that makes it harder to death strike for heals
[10:54:29] papagoog: like its just gonna die in a stun or sum
[10:54:38] papagoog: blood takes a shiat ton of borst
[10:55:07] Blaze150000: is the walking dead pvp talent useless when playing with clenching grasp ?
[10:55:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: And like blood shield is for physical damage, a fire or arcane mage might be able to melt it outside of AMS and AMZ, stuff like that
[10:55:26] Yankee_ZuIu: Blood TSG with intervene + disarm , fear + storm bolt = hard to kill 🙂
[10:56:00] shoes_off_first: i remember cata when vengeance was still around and blood dk's were absolute menaces
[10:56:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood is basically built like a vampire, almost all of its healing requires being on target for death strikes
[10:58:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: blood has a lot of utility to make it hard to kite, but I don't know how it holds up against AWC people
[10:58:53] sixthycent: blood dk
[10:59:46] sixthycent: practicing for awc?
[11:01:39] sunileif: woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
[11:01:52] sunileif: i believe in you
[11:02:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: rank 1 EZ
[11:03:39] Blaze150000: whats better if playing wieth aff lock ? Death chains or necro aura ?
[11:04:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm still wondering if that root beam from the boomkin actually shut down any of our abilities LUL
[11:05:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: ooooooh arcane mage

[11:14:31] lolifighteruww: i wanna come back to the game but struggling between choosing a class, what are some solid picks if i like sub rouge playstyle or is sub rogue good atm?
[11:14:59] biofreaks: @lolifighteruww All Rogue specs are very good right now.
[11:15:05] mayfire15: yes rogue is good
[11:15:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Currently many of the sub rogues are playing outlaw, but I think it's still viable for the most part
[11:16:21] mayfire15: sub is def still good.
[11:17:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Arcane guy wants to PvE, I'm sure he hates spending GCDs on mobility
[11:18:02] lolifighteruww: @biofreaks ty lets go <3
[11:18:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's awesome to see
[11:18:30] sunileif: torture more rogues

[11:18:46] americanmoses18: my god i sleep and wake up to mes going for rank 1 blood and ALMOST being therr lol
[11:19:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah this is kind of like old old school frost DK, just ruining mobility for others

[11:21:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Zug guy is making warrior look really good
[11:22:50] americanmoses18: LOL
[11:23:00] americanmoses18: mes 6-0 into top bdk man

[11:23:16] mayfire15: what mmr?
[11:23:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: It does make sense, if you can pin a few people together and the warrior just cleaves them down
[11:23:18] worstboomkinna: 6-0 as blood is wild

[11:28:42] americanmoses18: go for 2400 first bdk
[11:28:44] avenueone: are we gonna see blood in awc
[11:29:13] mayfire15: it was damp as fuck tho
[11:29:21] happyheals: you felt invincible
[11:29:38] happyheals: even the mage could see you
[11:29:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are nuanced abilities like vampiric blood that can take awhile to fully learn when and how to use the interaction
[11:29:45] americanmoses18: the fact mes in one night went to 2300+ bdk man
[11:29:48] SoraSkyforge: Nerfed in DF ssn1 --> Checks, Nerfed in DF ssn2 --> Checks, Nerfed in DF ssn3 --> Checks
[11:30:22] mayfire15: would more haste be good for damage?
[11:30:40] jo4sho85: would adding abit of stam make death strike hit harder?
[11:30:46] NaraliHS: I've won rounds from playing purgatory before
[11:31:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Only red thirst gives it CD reduction yeah
[11:31:35] Gashter: No l
[11:31:43] NaraliHS: You've mostly just been using vamp blood for bigger shells right
[11:31:46] jo4sho85: more stam bigger sheilds for ally
[11:31:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: The PvE guys run 1 point in red thirst, like that
[11:32:14] NaraliHS: Got it
[11:32:34] ShaHugs: goddamn how are you still awake
[11:33:30] NaraliHS: Sometimes it feels like they take magic damage while UI  shows they have shell
[11:33:48] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[11:35:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: They say in a class guide that you can snapshot anitmagic shell during vampiric blood for 30% more on it
[11:35:22] BrewCral: mes playing blood? that shit is evil
[11:35:57] screwztko: what rating?
[11:36:05] americanmoses18: hes not just playing it hes now rank 1 number 1 bdk @brewcral
[11:36:11] worstboomkinna: @screwztko #1
[11:36:17] BrewCral: LUL pure evil
[11:36:34] SuperSunBros64: it probably is because some comps will be hard countered unwinnable messes into deep damp
[11:36:37] SuperSunBros64: lol
[11:36:48] sharpdressedman15: did u get some scummy blood dk games in last night?
[11:36:50] americanmoses18: cmon mes go for 2400
[11:37:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it definitely can be useful in the right situation
[11:38:41] trickentender: hows the pvpv scene rn @notmes
[11:39:18] sharpdressedman15: do you think they could balance tanks in pvp in a way that people wouldnt hate?
[11:39:33] happyheals: doubt it
[11:39:34] garythos: is blood dk good in pvp ?
[11:39:46] happyheals: someone always complains about something
[11:39:54] garythos: whats your cr now ?
[11:40:15] happyheals: he is like  2.3k something
[11:40:37] garythos: so blood dk is really vaiable :D
[11:40:40] americanmoses18: 2346*
[11:40:53] garythos: ez r1 then
[11:40:58] SuperSunBros64: blood prob just wins if you play with rdruid into any other DK comp lol, PHDk, TSG, TWD what do they do, rdruid just heals third
[11:41:05] sunileif: 2600 at least
[11:41:13] sunileif: go vulpera for this too
[11:41:17] SoraSkyforge: mes im literally so angry, this is so annoying
[11:41:19] sunileif: really rub it in
[11:41:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm still wondering about the blood feast talent, that might be good for PvP
[11:41:23] SoraSkyforge: i feel like this doesnt happen to other classes
[11:41:26] sunileif: get all the salt in that wound
[11:42:01] sunileif: and some vinegar
[11:42:05] sharpdressedman15: prot pally and war have been good lots of times
[11:42:23] sharpdressedman15: african turtle cleave
[11:42:29] sunileif: LET ME LIVE VICARIOUSLY THRU YOU!
[11:42:33] SoraSkyforge: the reddit post i made
[11:42:37] SoraSkyforge: i whispered it to you here
[11:42:42] SoraSkyforge: its frustrating
[11:42:53] SoraSkyforge: i might jusdt be complete utter garbage
[11:43:43] jo4sho85: i bet bm bldk would be stupid if the bm could stay up
[11:43:44] mayfire15: what comp you play?
[11:43:50] sharpdressedman15: just play blood thats all
[11:43:54] sharpdressedman15: LUL
[11:44:04] americanmoses18: welp got my 1800 glad i did that early on
[11:44:15] americanmoses18: MES Q UP ALREADY LETS GO
[11:44:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's similar to sub rogue or a boomy spamming out clones, controlling the match
[11:44:34] timmah25: do guardian druid next
[11:44:36] NaraliHS: Blood is still miles worse than unholy but it feels good being tanky and tilting people with grips
[11:44:36] sunileif: again isnt that how rogues play? when would it get 'fixedi
[11:44:36] alltimer1986: blood dk is allot of fun lol
[11:44:45] sunileif: err why
[11:45:06] happyheals: better than healing and winning everyshuffle q and not gaining any rating
[11:45:16] sunileif: thought combat was immortal rn
[11:45:22] sunileif: outlaw'
[11:45:38] americanmoses18: man just said combat rogue LOL old man
[11:46:08] sunileif: so repeatedly stunned/gouge/blind/etc is ok but gripped alot aint
[11:46:08] happyheals: hemmorahge
[11:46:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: I still say combat sometimes too LUL
[11:46:13] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[11:46:43] sunileif: @americanmoses18 i often call things by the previous name
[11:46:49] happyheals: Rogues need to go back to their roots. Play with no off hand
[11:47:17] sunileif: still call a guioldie from 12 years ago by his previous charactres name
[11:47:53] traav_p: is blood the move??
[11:48:03] mayfire15: only reason rogue doesnt get nerfed more imo is it has such a high skill cap
[11:48:13] nikthevoker: need 3rd alt dk
[11:48:17] americanmoses18: damn you ancient ancient @sunileif
[11:48:33] timmah25: you got like 600 points first lobby

[11:50:00] alfredwexler: boring comp question: what devoker 3v3 comps are you seeing do well at the moment?
[11:50:01] stockbridge10: waiting on queue, fun

[11:50:27] biofreaks: Did you guys ques into a Blood DK last night?
[11:50:27] americanmoses18: im 12 how would that be possible @sunileif

[11:51:23] mayfire15: they were trolling last night tho lol
[11:51:40] happyheals: Magnusz has a 93% winrate in 2's I think
[11:51:51] americanmoses18: all mag does is 2s doe
[11:51:56] traav_p: i know DK was nerfed but doesnt feel that terrible honestly. maybe im too shit to notice xD
[11:52:06] Xeliumimar: new meta over night
[11:52:09] happyheals: just impressive %
[11:52:12] Darnias: can you please hover over the blinking items in bags
[11:52:23] happyheals: counter's rogue
[11:52:41] Darnias: you missed 2
[11:52:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: unholy with a lot of vers was looking promising, I think
[11:53:11] magnusz: @happyheals i got lucky
[11:53:38] magnusz: 2v2 makes more sense than 3v3 does in recent seasons
[11:53:51] magnusz: doesnt feel like m+
[11:53:51] happyheals: yeah right, I take a gander at your skills from time to time
[11:54:24] happyheals: just need to bring corruption back
[11:54:26] FeedzTitan: wtb corruptions
[11:54:37] FeedzTitan: ^ this guy gets it
[11:55:02] magnusz: yea i just dont like dealing w/ revolving rogue
[11:55:31] magnusz: its kinda depressing to play war bc it directly competes w/ rogue for spots
[11:55:36] magnusz: u either play rogue/caster or double caster
[11:55:36] FeedzTitan: RMP only comp that has never had a bad season.
[11:55:37] magnusz: no in between
[11:55:51] sunileif: just make flare radius twice the size
[11:56:00] magnusz: why would u bring a warrior when every other mortal strike class is better
[11:56:14] magnusz: o i meant melee
[11:56:23] magnusz: i forget hunters even a class
[11:56:26] sharpdressedman15: i want mortal wounds on lava burst
[11:56:27] sharpdressedman15: fuck it
[11:56:31] magnusz: hasnt been good in competitive play since bush was in office
[11:56:37] FeedzTitan: Warriors dont have diversity in playstyle - because it was designed by an ape for apes - but you get big brain arcane mages doing 150k dps in their gos
[11:57:06] magnusz: didnt tony/kasu win an awc in SL as jungle
[11:57:10] magnusz: or am i trippin
[11:58:45] magnusz: just cant keep up w/ the mobility arms race
[11:58:49] mayfire15: jungle used to actually be good into rm right?
[11:58:56] magnusz: https://i.imgur.com/khSASKZ.png
[11:59:04] magnusz: this was a fun awc season to watch
[11:59:27] magnusz: yea
[11:59:36] eXil1337: ye they did @magnusz
[12:00:22] rekroyal: what comps are there for dev evoker
