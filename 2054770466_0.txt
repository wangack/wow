[2:07:25] bleeppblorpp: @madsgtr34 if it's an alt and your main has flightstones, the keystone NPC by the portal sells random 441 items
[2:07:33] bleeppblorpp: account bound so you can send to alts
[2:07:42] K3ndo: @MarcoAbateIT Well. Do you have another character that has 1k or more score? Then you can buy equip from a vendor (with flightstones) that starts with 441.
[2:08:00] MarcoAbateIT: @K3ndo nop, this is my main char
[2:08:06] madsgtr34: @bleeppblorpp Ahh okay, didnt know! Yea it my alt
[2:08:11] goeythejoey: @MarcoAbateIT theres a discord community called 'wow made easy' that helps lower geared or skilled players clear keystones and raids
[2:08:54] MBG_95: Doing world quests can get you 437 gear, doing all events in emerald dream gives 441+ gear
[2:08:57] IAmLiebee: @goeythejoey Isnt it NA only?
[2:09:01] K3ndo: @MarcoAbateIT Then you can search for a community as madsgtr34 said or search for a guild maybe.
[2:09:08] MBG_95: Once you are 440+ you easily do your own +2 key
[2:09:51] goeythejoey: @IAmLiebee its it, the EU verison is called 'no pressure' i think
[2:09:53] K3ndo: @MBG_95 You can easily go +10 with 440. :D
[2:09:54] Ren26: isnt 25 below your usual
[2:10:08] Kuroz: warm up key hmmMeeting
[2:10:37] MBG_95: @k3ndo I said to run your own +2 key, ofc you can do higher but way easier to push your own
[2:10:48] goeythejoey: thats what the WME or NP after kesytone listings is, they sometimes have passwords on them to confirm its someone from the community and not some random toxic player
[2:11:02] K3ndo: @MBG_95 Yeah true. Especially when high geared people need crests. :D

[3:35:51] Elembry_us: @ellde22 It's uncommon to see a resto druid with skull bash bc of how far down on the tree it's located. We lose out on good talents. I do my best with typhoon and incap roar.
[3:35:59] Projectsolo: without coordinated kicks, this boss is at the same lvl as first boss in Brackenhide
[3:36:15] Andersonmps: Hi Carol! How are you? We emo today?
[3:36:30] LinkTTV_: @projectsolo I would say it's worse
[3:36:52] bielich132: @Projectsolo brackenhide isnt that hard. is only 1 caster that needed to be kicked. the heal could be purged easily
[3:37:09] bielich132: 2nd boss EB has much more casts

[4:04:29] Projectsolo: seemingly on single shadowbolt too, so maybe avoidance is gucci
[4:05:01] CactusJak__: avoidance works on shadowbolt for last boss

[4:07:31] Projectsolo: @Alassianss On not-even-close it says zephyr is DR on shadowbolt and shadowbolt volley, which insiuates that it's an AOE cast
[4:07:38] Projectsolo: scamaz I guess
