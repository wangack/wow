[0:22:00] NeeK_23: stockade spam with sleeping bag i think
[0:22:04] thunduz: there is only one thing to discuss today and that is how amazing that Deadpool 3 trailer was
[0:22:10] thunduz: also good morning
[0:22:33] thunduz: completelyagree
[0:22:46] illidari_Neeko: I’ve started playing SoD, I’m only level 10 troll hunter but I’m loving the grind so far! 💪🏼
[0:22:52] thunduz: I geeked out harder than I expected to at pyro returning
[0:22:57] NeeK_23: I watched the Marvels, and it was ok, not as bad as I heard it was
[0:23:05] MediumRareOG: classic is a vibe
[0:23:13] thunduz: sure is
[0:23:26] thunduz: truth
[0:23:30] Suze_o_0: wait, this is confusing, 2 Neeks both purple XD

[0:26:02] physalis4: less pages. lov eit
[0:26:02] Larkaro: oooooooooooo I like it
[0:26:07] ImperfectDark: ooh that's quite fancy
[0:26:16] BBMezzy: I think I hope it has a version that doesn't take up the whole screen
[0:26:18] MediumRareOG: they need to stop dividing abilities between general, class and spec
[0:26:22] SlithTheSivak: will make it much easier for my RP mage to cast straight from my spellbook
[0:26:23] DeadSeriousTV: Clean, also hey HeyGuys
[0:26:23] fetza108: @sydney_79 i love retail that is more solo friendy but in sod i love to be in party and communicate, grinde together.
[0:26:28] thunduz: everything looks so small
[0:26:31] NeeK_23: I hope it can be a one page option too. I dont like how talents now is so big
[0:26:48] Akela3: feels like it could be a little denser so it takes up less space
[0:27:10] volkreig: what realm you play SoD on?
[0:27:14] MediumRareOG: Just list all your active abilities in alphabetical order. that's all they need to do
[0:27:15] thunduz: I like the design of it but not the wording or icons inside the book
[0:27:40] thunduz: 100%
[0:27:43] MediumRareOG: there's too much blank space in the new spellbook imho
[0:28:00] Sydney_79: @fetza_twitch I´m a little shy so most oft time i´m doing things alone ^^
[0:28:22] Sydney_79: @fetza_twitch of the time

[0:29:19] MediumRareOG: AGM is the trinket from the STV arena
[0:30:12] nonchfriend: so Xera a prime naaru forged in the cosmos capable of destroying cities , thinks the burning legion is not the real threat but the void is and she foresaw that illidan will be the champion of the lights army and will lead great battles against the void , his warglaives shimmered in yellow in a vision , illidan realized these were his own features , uncaring for even the darkest entities , flying in the battle field decimating the void ranks

[0:34:24] SlithTheSivak: i love chats about real estate...
[0:35:17] SlithTheSivak: those r things ud need to negotiate
[0:35:24] thunduz: yeah I believe you put that in the sale statement
[0:35:49] MediumRareOG: don't people arrange contracts in a chain so they all exchange on the same day?
[0:35:59] SlithTheSivak: post closing stay clauses can affect sellability, u can always ask them for 30 days post sale...or make a contingent offer that is dependent on the sale of ur own home.
[0:36:01] Suze_o_0: buying houses is stupid!
[0:37:03] SlithTheSivak: having a good real estate agent in ur corner who can answer all ur questions would be super useful...in the US u dont pay them unless u close
[0:37:05] Wildsmasher: just have to give up the computer room
[0:37:11] Wildsmasher: EZ
[0:37:14] thunduz: on the sale details put in "House of famous youtuber"
[0:37:30] MediumRareOG: normal practice is to buy a place conditional on the sale of your current house.Your buyer might do the same so it forms a chain
[0:37:30] Wildsmasher: put your computer in living room?
[0:37:51] karanloss: Just because you get a bigger house and their own rooms does not mean the kids stop sleeping in your bedroom
[0:37:57] Annathebanana1986: just buy a summer house and have that as your work place
[0:38:01] Wildsmasher: i understand lol
[0:38:19] Wildsmasher: get a shed lol
[0:38:22] Suze_o_0: make a HE shed LOL
[0:38:29] thunduz: in the words of the great Diablo Dev, "Doesn't she have a phone?"
[0:38:34] Annathebanana1986: covert the attic?
[0:39:23] Wildsmasher: underground bunker in the garden to stream from
[0:39:31] Suze_o_0: yea, you need at least 2bdrm now
[0:40:00] Suze_o_0: raising twins we HAD to have a 2 bedroom when we looked
[0:40:05] Annathebanana1986: put a caravan on the driveway ;p
[0:40:06] Suze_o_0: oh yea LMAO sorry not awake yet
[0:40:23] MediumRareOG: time to move to yorkshire LULW
[0:40:38] Wildsmasher: what about renting out a small office for the time being while looking for new house for work
[0:41:00] thunduz: ask the parents to have your old bedroom back if in the same house. that way also build in daycare with the grandparents
[0:41:04] Wildsmasher: lol that bad wiw
[0:41:07] Wildsmasher: wow

[0:42:14] Wildsmasher: he lives with his GF at your mum and dads?
[0:42:19] SlithTheSivak: u should live with ur parents...
[0:42:21] Annathebanana1986: will they house swap with you/
[0:42:23] MediumRareOG: have an office at your parents' place?
[0:42:32] Wildsmasher: are they saving up ?
[0:42:37] thunduz: sorry bro, need your living space to work. yeet
[0:42:38] Wildsmasher: i moved out when i was 17
[0:42:51] SlithTheSivak: can you hire your own remote office spacec?

[0:43:13] Wildsmasher: gachiGASM
[0:43:16] SlithTheSivak: treehouse!
[0:43:48] MediumRareOG: buying conditional to sale of this house seems to be the path forward
[0:43:49] lyreilla: Dawww, is she bumming?

[0:44:17] thunduz: It's time to stream FF14 mrgmSell mrgmThis mrgmThis mrgmThis mrgmThis get that bank

[0:44:54] JakeSezz: That’s not very mrgmSell of you mrgmHehe
[0:45:14] JakeSezz: I reckon Dan is more punk rock than we ever gave him credit for saltyb27Cheers
[0:46:05] thunduz: @JakeSezz as the great band RBF once said mrgmSell mrgmJAM
[0:46:20] JakeSezz: you’re not selling out to make more money. you’re sticking to the grind and passion and not going with everyone else to make bank
[0:46:26] JakeSezz: @thunduz mrgmHehe mrgmHehe
[0:46:36] Annathebanana1986: but while renting its hard to have extra money to put away :(
[0:47:10] thunduz: being punk is extremely stupid lol that's why it's punk. you do what you want
[0:47:26] JakeSezz: And that is punk rock: being fucking stupid, as you stay broke.
[0:47:26] Annathebanana1986: average is around 1300 a month for a 2 bed
[0:47:56] zantos2020: I bought my second house for 160k and sold it 5 years later for 240k, and used that money as a down payment on my dream home
[0:48:05] Demeternoth: Kap is trying to move in Brighton, he has a 3bed 2 bath apartment on the market and they're trying to sell 1bed 1bath places NEXT DOOR to him at the same price. And for a price you'd get at least 4 beds in the midlands XD
[0:48:24] SlithTheSivak: its sad im not a sod fan, but im here for u Dan!
[0:48:28] Iwony: yeah I am not much of a fan of SoD ^^
[0:48:59] thunduz: I'm just here for the chats so I don't care much for what you play.
[0:48:59] MediumRareOG: maybe it's just a saturated market?

[0:51:26] SlithTheSivak: the housing market in seattle went a bit nuts during covid so we're at 3x value since purchase...gonna move to cali soon it looks like
[0:51:28] volkreig: dw im only 29 lol
[0:52:12] Suze_o_0: twitch must be mess up, its keeps telling emt o share teh anniverisary again!
[0:52:19] SlithTheSivak: property taxes are equivalent, theres an income tax that WA doesnt have but its not that bad
[0:52:27] thunduz: seems to be that way
[0:52:50] thunduz: tneAloha tneAloha tneAloha
[0:52:53] BBMezzy: It doesn't help that 10.2.6 won't be on PTR
[0:53:20] thunduz: mrgmHehe
[0:53:26] Suze_o_0: moms lucky, here in MI she qualifies for Homesteading and only pays taxes on a certain amount of the property taxes. HOWEVER we have summer and winter taxes because we are on the lakes
[0:54:37] Mazerbeam: Because they are homesteading?
[0:54:37] Elrathir: Cheer100 Hi
[0:54:38] Demeternoth: I think we'd call a homestead a 'small holding' like a small farm I guess??
[0:54:42] SlithTheSivak: homesteads are like self sufficient land areas...u need the land to live
[0:54:59] Suze_o_0: The exemption may offer ongoing reductions in property taxes depending on state laws.
[0:55:03] Suze_o_0: noooooooooooooo
[0:55:04] apollymae: because we own our own home
[0:55:22] Annathebanana1986: im confused too
[0:55:22] physalis4: It's apparently a few things
[0:55:32] Althalan: hey mrgm! hey i wondered did you ever talk to pyromancer again? i come from ff14 community and most of us dislike him, he is so angry and triggered all the time, even treats his viewers like a prick
[0:55:53] SlithTheSivak: o this is like old west homesteading
[0:55:56] MediumRareOG: "homesteading" is how America spread west. people were given free land (eg 40 acres) as long as they worked the land for 10 years, they'd own it
[0:56:08] physalis4: I guess it protects my wife from getting kicked from our home if I die
[0:56:33] JakeSezz: @althalan That’s because he’s a prick saltyb27Cheers jakese1LUL

[0:57:09] SlithTheSivak: modern homesteading is like, people pickling a lot of stuff and really efficient gardens
[0:57:10] physalis4: It was God's will we took that land
[0:57:13] JakeSezz: And that is my opinion, not that of MrGM or his chat lmao
[0:57:20] Suze_o_0: we also have an enhanced life estate deed. for me and my sister, NEITHER of us can sell the house etc only if we both agree
[0:57:20] Jelky55: you ll have your own farm in Mists classic with Tillers <3
[0:57:21] Jelky55: hi btw
[0:58:21] SlithTheSivak: shit like that is why you have to hire a lawyer to sell houses in NY, convoluted ownership titles that are spread between like 10 generations
[0:58:25] Elrathir: hah, yeah I finally finished Tillers rep too on my monk, after having left it just barely unfinished since mists
[0:58:43] MediumRareOG: In the US there are a TON of programs to help you buy farmland, even like 5-10 acres and you can get that much land for like $50k
[0:58:54] Annathebanana1986: how come your cousin got it?
[0:59:17] physalis4: "favorite cousin"
[0:59:35] Annathebanana1986: ahhh, no will then :(
[0:59:42] MediumRareOG: typically in situations like this, one child will buy out the others based on current market value
[0:59:42] SlithTheSivak: 0% down, 3% interest rate USDA loans in the US. Just have to move to a rural property
[1:00:00] Annathebanana1986: ahh okies
[1:00:15] physalis4: My wife's grandmother died, and selling the house was super messy. Aunts/Uncles fought over stuff
[1:00:31] Demeternoth: because they're made of wood!
[1:00:39] ImperfectDark: i feel like US houses are made of wood
[1:00:47] SlithTheSivak: im on a housing site right now, where do you think a cheap area of the country is?
[1:00:47] apollymae: depends on where you buy
[1:00:49] Demeternoth: @ImperfectDark jinx
[1:00:52] MediumRareOG: Because American houses are made of balsa wood that blow over in a stiff breeze
[1:01:04] BBMezzy: I'd assume it's to do with them having more space. Just the ground alone makes Dutch homes crazy expensive
[1:01:10] ImperfectDark: @Demeternoth LUL
[1:01:24] Demeternoth: You get a lot more house for your money for sure - same in Australia. Much more spacious home
[1:01:27] Demeternoth: homes*

[1:01:58] havoom01: start to dig and hope to find oil
[1:02:22] SlithTheSivak: buying land that has the potential for building is worth it, if u do a land assessment and find out its a wetlands or has a shallow water table then u have a lot of useless land...
[1:02:28] NeeK_23: @Demeternoth but you have to survive the drop bears
[1:02:35] MediumRareOG: A farmer in Australila cashed in on Sydney's western expansion in the 1970s and 1980s to the tune of over $1 billion
[1:03:19] Demeternoth: @NeeK_23 honestly, for those houses, totally worth it.
[1:03:48] apollymae: depends. right now where i am they are building a lot of houses but no one is buying them
[1:04:55] NeeK_23: speaking of houses, looks like Taliesin is having a bad day
[1:04:59] SlithTheSivak: 300k is $378,525.00, which is a decent 2 bedroom house in most regions of the US in a suburb.
[1:05:12] NeeK_23: latest tweet
[1:05:21] Elrathir: lol yeah I just saw that tweet
[1:05:28] JakeSezz: I just saw the same 😬😂 @neek_23
[1:05:45] physalis4: pipe burst
[1:05:46] SlithTheSivak: water leak
[1:05:48] NeeK_23: burst pip i guess
[1:05:59] Demeternoth: oooofff
[1:06:20] physalis4: we had our shower leak to the 1st floor, and our whole HVAC die the first year we were in our house
[1:06:22] Elrathir: that's an oof, but at least they got a funny tweet out of it
[1:06:26] thunduz: damn that sucks!
[1:06:27] Demeternoth: the damage that can happen from water leaks is not fun to correct and is also why I have some plaster board missing in my kitchen
[1:06:30] NeeK_23: nice high ceilings though

[1:12:33] Layliah79: was fake labeling
[1:12:38] Akela3: i would indeed be annoyed
[1:12:42] Layliah79: cause of what PReach said
[1:12:47] WoWRoach: People are going to be annoyed anyway.
[1:12:57] BBMezzy: People will be dissapointed no matter what, the teasing was too much and has set expectations too high.. it'll be their own fault
[1:12:59] NeeK_23: its Mage tower 2, the Pirate Dragon Tower
[1:13:10] Layliah79: he said in one of his recent videos that Blizzard will start faking labeling stuff to keep people thrown off when datamining.
[1:13:11] JakeSezz: @wowroach saltyb27Cheers

[2:05:05] Sydney_79: runes are a bit harder to get than p1
[2:05:22] MediumRareOG: Legion, BFA and SL have achievements where you have to defeat all the pet masters with all mechanical, all undead, all elemental, etc. it adds up

[2:30:16] bojackhorseman2004: they used to have "mandetory farms" which would last more than 1 month, since they dont have that they need to add content in the middle patches

[3:22:47] Sleepyjoegaming: I think you you’re doing great on twitch if people want to make the effort to dive deeper they will find twitch
[3:23:05] Jack_the_Dipper: doesn't matter, people will kknown
[3:23:26] WoWRoach: I mean, I'm watching your stream after finding you on youtube first.
[3:23:29] Jack_the_Dipper: Give it a trry
[3:23:34] Jack_the_Dipper: cant  hurt
[3:23:42] ImperfectDark: these shorts are on youtube so if people want to find a twitch channel or check socials, surely they'd check out mrgm's profile
[3:23:54] Jack_the_Dipper: Give it 2 weeks,  put in thetext  of  whaat you are saying and  you will see  a boost
[3:23:57] Sleepyjoegaming: @wowroach is that because you dove deeper or knew he was a twitch streamer aswell?
[3:24:13] Jack_the_Dipper: People dont care if  its from Twitch or youtueb, they waant to see you live
[3:24:19] WoWRoach: Dove deeper.  Liked the videos, wanted to see more
[3:24:55] Jack_the_Dipper: @MrGM I found you through Saamadan and Manthieus and  I watch  a lot of  wow onn  youtueb but never seen  you

[3:26:26] Layliah79: lol
[3:26:37] Dunkurk: I'd agree the shorts dont make sense to drive to twitch if they havnt come from it, that's likly to just make people go "Oh i like this style of vid ill check twitch" then they come and its a slower pace chiller vibe than a 1 min short
[3:26:38] Layliah79: 24?!! god i'm old

[3:51:10] Zuldak: How ID works in the US is that every state is responsible to issue a state ID. However the federal government has instituted a minimal security threshold state issued licenses need to meet. State level IDs like driver licenses are not valid at airports unless they meet federal qualifications. I have to use my passport at airpoirts not my drivers license
[3:51:19] Demeternoth: Well. you say that. but sugarmomma over here is working on things
[3:51:41] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies 🧡 https://www.patreon.com/MrGM

[3:52:01] Dunkurk: There is a lot of americans that dont have a passport
[3:52:04] Zuldak: most americans dont have a passport.
[3:52:15] MediumRareOG: currently it takes 2-3 months to get a passport
[3:52:17] lyreilla: Or the documents to get a passport lol
[3:52:30] thereal_stmarie: mostly because they can't afford to travel outside the country
[3:52:33] Dunkurk: You can fly UK domestic with a driving license
[3:52:46] Zuldak: @WoWRoach depends on your state. Im in Oregon and ours don't meet the requirements. They are issuing new ones that do but i still have an older license
[3:52:47] Dunkurk: I flew to Orkney with my license
[3:52:48] Lausten: Dont want a southerner in to the north I guess Kappa
[3:52:56] Demeternoth: Yup funnily enough I know someone who knows someone ;-p
[3:53:03] neverbornlucky: I just can't stand people who do not like to be prepared if you have the time. I got  mad at my dad cause he doesn't want to have things ready
[3:53:06] bomayaa: I have never heard of using a driving licence at an airport
[3:53:11] Demeternoth: XD
[3:53:27] Demeternoth: Anyway must sort dinner! no hellofresh here for me XD Take care everyone!
[3:53:42] Zuldak: It wasnt that long ago that flying from london to hongkong would have been considered a domestic flight
[3:53:44] Lausten: @bomayaa You can do that in Denmark as well as long as you're not leaving the country
[3:54:53] Dunkurk: In theory you can fly to gibrlatar with a Driving licnese
[3:55:15] neverbornlucky: MrGm I learned about the worse food in England  Jelly Ells
[3:55:17] MediumRareOG: that's like Reunion Island or whatever it's called. French territory off the coast of Canada. Technically the EU touches Canada
[3:55:22] chelfx: @elkhuntsman he is in UK
[3:55:47] bomayaa: it's not northern mate, it's essex
[3:56:01] bomayaa: south coast
[3:56:08] chelfx: Did you know Canada shares a border with Denmark
[3:56:14] bomayaa: essex is northern? :)
[3:56:18] Dunkurk: Im sure reunion is africa
[3:56:26] MediumRareOG: No, you're right. I was completely wrong. It's called Saint-Pierre and Miquelon
[3:57:14] Lausten: Whats the point of those boxes? Rep?
[3:57:14] MediumRareOG: That French island had a booming business in alcohol sales during Prohibition
[3:57:38] chelfx: The king is coming to Canada
[3:57:41] neverbornlucky: I'm just lucky that texas allows you to renew drivers without taking test again if it is before 2 year length date after expiring
[3:58:35] neverbornlucky: Chat I learned as well watching jolly on youtube that Brits like Mash and pie

[3:59:28] S3N71: @neverbornlucky We prefer the term pie and mash
[3:59:31] chelfx: Pie in the UK is always different than US
[3:59:34] neverbornlucky: they don't flavor it when cooking with salts or seasoning
[4:00:14] chelfx: US don't really have savoury pie
[4:00:16] Midgens_: apple pie
[4:00:19] neverbornlucky: peacan pie
[4:00:20] bomayaa: a film
[4:00:20] Midgens_: cherry pie
[4:00:21] Dunkurk: Fruit pies are american
[4:00:30] Midgens_: and the crusts are a little different
[4:00:41] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:00:42] Dunkurk: You cant for example get a good steak pie in the US
[4:00:50] bomayaa: @neverbornlucky yes they are :/
[4:00:51] MediumRareOG: "pie" in the US means 1) pizza 2) sweet pies like pecan and pumpkin and 3) savoury pies. Savoury pies aren't that common though, other than chicken pot pie

[4:07:03] Zuldak: One thing visiting oriental grocers is to be careful about the word 'seasoned'. It could me spiced, it could mean aged. The 'seasoned' squid was not what i expected
[4:07:04] MediumRareOG: apple and cinammon is suhc a fire combo
