[1:33:51] steeldeal615: Good morning!
[1:33:52] Mayorbeeohyayy: I apologize I have been away for the past 2 days did they have a winner for the race to world first yet or is it still going on
[1:34:09] raldrik: I think releasing the raids at the same time makes the RWF quite boring. Basically added 2 days of extra splits and made it so that only the teams know when the real hype should start
[1:34:13] EggsotiX: @JohnnyFragz nah, thats over
[1:34:14] danimoto10: so what will be the ideal key level this week for the chest?
[1:34:27] Armdel: @Mayorbeeohyayy race hast started, but not guild has started mythic yes
[1:34:49] Armdel: yet*
[1:35:03] AzoreanLegend: couldnt care about the first race at all this time
[1:35:04] Mayorbeeohyayy: @armdel ty for the info
[1:35:04] Artemisthemp: The Jailer was the best
[1:35:07] Aquadriel: Could be because people are actually playing the game cause theres a shit ton to do.
[1:35:10] Sylphy_TV: what story
[1:35:11] Thoreya: i think its also bc people arent touching mythic yet
[1:35:19] espenenenen: is there any chance theyre not done with the race before christmas eve?
[1:35:22] azell117: has mythic always dropped with normal/heroic?
[1:35:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: i really dont start watching until the final boss
[1:35:28] raldrik: better then the jailer... the bar is real low
[1:35:29] Thoreya: they had like 300k viewers yesterday. not bad for not starting mythic
[1:35:38] CajunCrusader: Christmas Cookie Bakeoff has a better story than the jailor.
[1:35:43] Armdel: wow isn't really attracting alot of new players
[1:36:18] EggsotiX: @Armdel it actually is. People are getting sick of the same fps games  tbh
[1:36:24] Thoreya: watching heroic splits isnt exciting
[1:36:51] Thoreya: or normal splits like liquid lol
[1:37:07] Artemisthemp: Kaelthas and Vashh was better
[1:37:12] TheBradest: @eggsotix Where did you come up with that information?
[1:37:19] Sollice: Morning
[1:37:23] Thoreya: yes

[1:37:28] raldrik: yeah
[1:37:29] Thoreya: yep
[1:37:33] Thoreya: liquid did 18 normal splits
[1:37:35] slaughteredpig: @eggsotix not really. People are getting sick of the same mmorpgs
[1:37:37] Thoreya: echo went to heroic
[1:37:39] Eggz1004: both cleared normal
[1:37:47] PhillyDilly18: I’m not totally sure what a split is for the races
[1:37:48] PokerFaceMoose: @Sollice towByah towByah good morning
[1:37:51] Sylphy_TV: Best race: Firelands with Hogger
[1:38:07] jarilrpg: well it doesnt matter for trading anymore which you do first
[1:38:10] raldrik: none is past 6/8 heroic right
[1:38:16] Effin_Steffin: Echo build diff they don’t fuck around or giggle. Straight Sweaty.
[1:38:40] Scorpiris_Junoh: What is a "split"?
[1:38:43] Thoreya: @raldrik echo is 7.8 heroic
[1:38:45] Thoreya: 7/8
[1:38:51] Thoreya: killed the seventh boss like an hour ago
[1:38:55] RobNXS: Maybe just trying to get as much tier as possible. Does Normal tier stack with heroic?
[1:39:04] rochem: 18normal and we're going to 12 heroic splits according to max yesterday but I went to bed before they started doing heroic
[1:39:08] Attackroot: @Scorpiris_Junoh like 4-5 guild people and rest pugs to trade loot
[1:39:09] cyrex172: BIDETS ARE BOTH HYGENIC AND REFRESHING
[1:39:36] alextheory_: how was progression for your guild?

[2:35:24] Castaway1: !drops
[2:35:28] ElroenFlyrow: @Towelliee I dont know why ppl say its a battlepass. Visually, it might look like 1, but every game I see that has battle pass, they cost REAL money and the rewards are fixated as you lvl it up, here we are getting currency to buy skins that we CHOOSE, all freely...
[2:35:46] Kinghorn: I fucking love the WQs not being every day
[2:35:50] hisfrankness: RWF?
[2:35:56] Artemisthemp: I'm happy with current module

[2:35:58] Sauby02: @towelliee did you already talk about the tailoring bans?
[2:36:14] Aegllor: @Flyrowi but it still costs 15 a month to play the game. so technically, its not free.
[2:36:22] Kinghorn: that is for making the harpoon
[2:36:25] beezly33: To summon Fisherman Tunnak
[2:36:26] Nimz83: Iskaar
[2:36:29] Dragonkiller1974: that is for the harpoon
[2:36:30] Nimz83: Fisherman spawn
[2:36:32] RocketvanPersie: @Flyrowi people are just turned off from that style of earning stuff in game cuz of all the other games that do it, imo battle passes or whatever you wanna call em are a good thing for games, and this is no different
[2:36:32] Nimz83: Idk
[2:36:37] Broomba: can u see disturbed dirt with WM off @towelliee or does it work in WM on?
[2:36:37] Wolfehammer: people are not happy unless they are complaining

[2:39:45] Aegllor: @Flyrowi i haven't even played for 18 years. but my point is most battlepasses in other games do capitalize on FOMO. do this stuff and get this skin you can only get from this specific battlepass.

[5:23:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Apparently some people figured out how to get those cooldowns to reset too soon, and they made a bunch of cloth when they shouldn't have been able to
[5:23:30] WaxDabMan: how can they punish me?? i just did what the game allowed??

[5:24:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: With issues like that, there's not much that you can do. You can plead your case in the forums, maybe
[5:25:20] WaxDabMan: That makes absolutely NO SENSE, its THEIR MISTAKE
[5:25:43] calamitygg: @waxdabman you’re a clown mate
[5:25:43] WaxDabMan: For real, how do they feel THAT is the answer to people playing their game the way they made it??
[5:25:49] Holysal: its in the ToS and its their game. they can do that
[5:25:49] pezjb: any news on the tailoring ban wave??
[5:25:49] Maldre: how much did you make
[5:25:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is possible to open a ticket after getting banned to ask for a review, I think
[5:25:55] tr4ncetv: lol, if you abused the hell out of it then that's on you
[5:26:04] shiftfazed: why only a 10

[5:26:42] tr4ncetv: hundreds!
[5:26:52] WaxDabMan: A whole week ban ON RELEASE WEEK?!
[5:26:52] Vitalitea_: type it louder
[5:26:53] pezjb: the ingame UI doesn't explain at all about the CD. there was no awareness whatsoever.

[5:27:15] KoRnyRocks: whos banned?
[5:27:16] ZeusDNA: Man, the bank left their door unlocked so I robbed it and got arrested. It was their mistake! Blasphemy
[5:27:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: One of the PvP guys I watch got banned wrongly for RMT (a number of streamers did), and you can try a ticket but it took weeks before he got it fixed
[5:27:24] WaxDabMan: I really want to lawyer up but they have infinite pockets, that is so wrong of them, its criminal
[5:27:24] shiftfazed: did limit quit already?

[5:28:14] Holysal: @wEiRdO_dUdE dude is crying bc he exploited the tailoring cd and is now banned for 7 days
[5:28:19] WaxDabMan: 7 days sry
[5:28:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Fjb in this case a number of tailors got banned because of a possible cooldown exploit, there's a post on WoWhead about it
[5:28:30] tr4ncetv: yeah its easy, we didnt exploit
[5:28:32] KoRnyRocks: even you exploited the game, the ban is fine no matter what. you took advantage of an error in the game
[5:28:34] WaxDabMan: for somehting I didnt do wrong, you cant punish others for your mistakes right? wtf
[5:28:38] danimoto10: yo guys, any reason to still do the rares?
[5:28:41] pezjb: most people did not knowingly exploit anything. they were just using the ingame system.
[5:28:50] DraulTheVikingFox: i love this dungeon
[5:28:52] WaxDabMan: How do i even know its an exploit, thats so dumb to say

[5:30:35] TialePetit: @WaxDabMan then put that energy that you have here into a ticket to them explaining. spending it here isn't going to do you any help.
[5:30:41] Thezoh: think of how great ignorance would be as a defense in court. Im sorry your honor i had no idea i coudlnt evade taxes.
[5:30:43] WaxDabMan: That is dumb, you guys are acting like i cheated on a test. I played the game for hours, followed what thew game allowed as i was playing. i dont exploit for gold ill just buy wow tokens, im not poor

[5:31:39] slimskeezy13: most wow players have never done a single thing wrong in their lives
[5:31:39] triari_lol_wow: make a ticket and explain to blizz, talking about it here isn't doing anything
[5:31:41] ZeusDNA: @WaxDabMan You could stop complaining in here and go call Blizzard then bud lol Nothing we're going to do to help you.
[5:31:42] KoRnyRocks: @WaxDabMan spend your energy on a ticket. the more you cr here, the more it convince me that you knew you exploited
[5:31:44] WaxDabMan: People take time off work to play the game, and they do this with no communication
[5:31:44] slimskeezy13: or at least they think so
[5:31:49] Calphurnious: Why you even bringing wow tokens into this LUL
[5:31:49] DaBestGAround: They can't prove that you did something unintentionally, hence why you can contest the suspension

[5:31:50] upinurguts: just curious, but did you KNOW that you were getting the CD faster than you should have? I mean did you report that it was happening? Honestly you cant believe you did NOTHING wrong

[5:32:22] Tyr7: more like they need better Quality testing, banning people for their mistake is not fair
[5:32:24] Arbszy: Takes all things in moderation, even WoW.
[5:32:29] KoRnyRocks: @WaxDabMan no matter if an error is in a game, the moment people exploit that, you violate the TOS.
[5:32:49] Decapp: my man got 30 days take the 7 lol
[5:32:56] Unciatim: Doing it once.. Blizz will give you the benefit of the doubt.. doing it 50 times... they know you knew it was a bug and exploited it
[5:32:57] tr4ncetv: need to upgrade my ring, 346 holding me back a lil
[5:33:03] xALcaPWNedx: on the bright side, you came to the right channel to get your wow fix
[5:33:06] exaltedholyman: When they rolled out the hot fix the other night and broke the game was fun
[5:33:09] KoRnyRocks: @WaxDabMan i got banned for exploiting a part of the game i didnt know was an exploit. You live you learn, thats why there is TOS
[5:33:12] homewrecker101: lol its a break for a week get over ir
[5:33:33] Frenaris: @WaxDabMan you calling us all dumb? TF is wrong with you
[5:33:36] friendlyfalcon: To be fair, it wasn't even profitable, I'm willing to bet someone who caught a 7 days was just unable to read the tooltip, 30 days though, they for sure knew.
[5:33:37] DiaboliKarl: what was being exploited? I missed it
[5:33:43] friendlyfalcon: Unable as in unwilling.
[5:33:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: I need to find a rare that drops up to a 385 ring, too. Two in Obsidian Citadel drop up to 369 rings
[5:33:45] KoRnyRocks: its like, if something in life is too good to be true.. its probably not okay
[5:33:50] trione288: @DiaboliKarl cloth shit
[5:34:01] friendlyfalcon: @DiaboliKarl Tailoring exploit bans, trophy exploit bans are probably coming.
[5:34:02] Artemisthemp: 16 m to feast
[5:34:03] gold9871: gg
[5:34:05] trione288: Azure cloth
[5:34:07] trione288: @Towelliee
[5:34:10] DiaboliKarl: oh i don't f with tailoring
[5:34:14] triari_lol_wow: Azure and Chromo bolts

[5:34:17] g0n_z3n: Cooldown exploit i believe
[5:34:22] friendlyfalcon: There were tailoring CDs that were reset if you kept relogging, chrono cloth and the other one.
[5:34:28] Artemisthemp: Arcane and Chronocloth CD reset, so people could craft a lot instead of only once
[5:34:33] DiaboliKarl: I just farm herbs and ore and sell it
[5:34:33] WaxDabMan: Its not an exploit to hit your cooldowns everytime they come up, it makes no sense
[5:34:33] CardinalTX: Devs be watchin, they hatin, blizz devs tryin to catch me crafting dirty, tryin catch me crafting dirty, tryin catch me crafting dirty
[5:34:35] Tyr7: a lot of us used garrison for disenchanting and getting crystals, for that they just removed that option yesterday, luckily no ban
[5:34:38] DiaboliKarl: don't have time for crafting
[5:34:47] Lostdogal: Another crafting trap lol, thats why I dont do it man.
[5:34:52] KoRnyRocks: every single exploit should get someone banned no matter what. you can NEVER ever contest doing it on purpose or not knowing.
[5:34:55] MILESkg21: it is an exploit if they are supposed to be like 24 hours
[5:34:55] KoRnyRocks: take the ban
[5:35:06] trione288: this dungeon hurts in mythic plus peepoSad
[5:35:09] xALcaPWNedx: lol at this point, follow up on your blizzard GM ticket
[5:35:16] ChonkzillaTV: these sha are annoying
[5:35:19] xALcaPWNedx: twitch chat is just going to push your buttons
[5:35:20] friendlyfalcon: @Tyr7 Because that was more their mistake. The tailoring one had text that clearly showed it was meant to be a long cooldown.
[5:35:31] KoRnyRocks: @WaxDabMan the cooldown was shorter than normal. and it got exploited
[5:35:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember how much of a pain that Titansteel cooldown was, but it was designed to keep the game from being flooded with it
[5:35:45] pezjb: they just overturned the ban!!!

[5:37:07] hickey7979: I got away with it back in classic there was a bug allowing you to craft as many titansteel as you had stats for if you clicked craft all. I explained myself they undid my crafting back to 1 bar ezpz. I didnt go ahead and list my bag full of bars bc I realized that shouldnt have happened and thats why I didnt get banned
[5:37:14] DiaboliKarl: tanking has always been my go to (off tank in MC back in the day) but now I'm too casual to be able to guide the group so I do dps or heals

[5:38:01] friendlyfalcon: @KoRnyRocks Cobalt Assembly was a decent place to do it, to 1shot the elite dragons there.
[5:38:04] GingerGambit: I honestly think warriors are a little overhyped
[5:38:05] tr4ncetv: where do go for tank ring? anyone?
[5:38:05] KoRnyRocks: @friendlyfalcon yes hence and exploit. you know its 24 hours
[5:38:23] 0savitar0: i thought the the suppose bolt exploit was just how the new system worked because i specced into reduce cd, but appealed and they just unbanned

[5:38:39] blazyturtle: back from lulas stream i learned a lot about dragons, weird amount of forced breeding in blizz dragon lore
[5:38:51] friendlyfalcon: @KoRnyRocks I do think the 7 day bans shouldn't have happened, because they didn't clearly profit so it's a big ???, but the 30 day ones were probably very deserved.
[5:38:51] DiaboliKarl: how is vengeance dh? I am main havoc right now
