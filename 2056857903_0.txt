[1:29:23] dublincaterlin: i will say warrior dps with the Consumed By Rage rune is insaenly fun, you would love it @SalvDali
[1:29:24] Shakaars: why is it only your stream i cant watch, stream stops like every 5 sec for me-.-
[1:29:35] Ranzorx: im lowkey worried about false bans for gdkps in era
[1:29:43] netherwind_jon: I swear we hear this exact spiel at least twice a stream lol
[1:29:46] gryphsx: @dublincaterlin too bad they needed consumed. by rage into the ground
[1:29:47] Atherions: In SoD every raid is like a fully warrior stacked raid in ERA
[1:29:50] gryphsx: nerfed
[1:29:57] dublincaterlin: when did they do that???
[1:30:00] Kapers_: I think if you don't enjoy PVP SoD really isn't for you, feels like that if half of the content.
[1:30:16] gryphsx: @dublincaterlin it‚Äôs only 10% extra dam now not 20%
[1:30:28] Ranzorx: the problem is its an automated ban and good luck appealing
[1:30:32] Nesqu3: I get kind of paniced how sweeping balance changes they make. They're just swinging a hammer at balance and letting the players get stomped in pvp.
[1:30:48] Ranzorx: its hard enough to get a real human to look at your support ticket
[1:31:22] jlegretta: who minmaxes sod, literal one button content
[1:31:24] Midiosa: @Kapers_ PvP was in no way needed for P1 unless you wanted the gear just like in classic.  Even doing the Ashenvale event, I rarely had to kill a player during it
[1:31:40] plc_lol: @jlegretta the same ppl who minmax nochanges, the 2 button content
[1:32:04] simonromlie: @jlegretta Its more buttons to press in SoD than Era lets be real, both are fun still
[1:32:04] Ranzorx: @Nesqu3 yeah its the retail experience and it sucks
[1:32:11] corndogdaddi: gdkps are ass look at eras economy its so bad LUL
[1:32:17] Kapers_: @Midiosa Not saying it's needed, jjust saying that's a big part of their content, look at STV for phase2, they are putting a lot of time into it... It's a faction agnostic free for all
[1:32:18] leomnzzz: I understand your point but it's exactly the same as Classic Era just with the modifications to WorldPVP and runes and some quality of life improvements, but I really understand your point of view, my question was more about whether we would possibly have an exceptional player playing with us.
[1:32:22] netherwind_jon: There will prob be more opportunities for people to be sweaty once cap is 60 and raids are out
[1:32:43] HumungaaDungaa: i cant wait for SOD Hardcore servers
[1:32:47] Ranzorx: appealing to casuals to the point of punishing hardcore players
[1:33:09] Hackwork: @Ranzorx Elaborate?
[1:33:21] soulybaby: Hahaha
[1:33:36] daggerslife: I enjoy sod and i am by no means a sweatlord, but GOD FORBID you think about something that puts you ahead of anyone .
[1:33:48] dublincaterlin: if you hate world pvp you would hate running into a druid in SoD
[1:33:50] Ranzorx: @daggerslife this
[1:33:52] dublincaterlin: literal demos
[1:33:54] dublincaterlin: demons*
[1:34:07] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[1:34:16] Hackwork: the wpvp part can suck my did. I rolled on a pvp server with my friends and I got to 23 before bailing to a pve server to play alone
[1:34:25] Midiosa: @Kapers_ you were saying if you don't enjoy PvP, then SOD isn't for you.  I hate PvP and am enjoying it just fine because it's not a required thing.  Even wo doing the STV event, you'll still have the raid to do
[1:34:27] HumungaaDungaa: what do you mean, dont u remember ranking early on in classic where if you were horde u had to hunt alliance to extinction?
[1:34:27] gryphsx: hol up you don‚Äôt wanna get relentlessly camped in stv? Kappa
[1:34:29] HumungaaDungaa: that shit was fun
[1:34:38] Ranzorx: it is nothing like era other than being in the same zones
[1:34:50] Ranzorx: its closer to low level wrath than anything vanilla
[1:34:56] Liidocaine: I had fun leveling a little in SOD but I didnt finish it out, I adhd'd over to other games. the runes were fun at low levels tho
[1:35:09] Kapers_: @Midiosa Right... a 1 hour raid every 3 days...
[1:35:22] dublincaterlin: you can opt out of stv pvp
[1:35:24] ArtyomTrityak: In my opinion, leveling is overrated. Killing mobs and doing some quests, it is not super exiting gameplay. I prefer end-game, and SOD focus on leveling experience is imo meh
[1:35:29] Kapers_: @Midiosa then you braid your ass hairs the rest of the time?
[1:35:36] TheBoyChowder: I think the idea of SoD is fun, but I think the level cap for each phase is super stupid
[1:35:41] Ranzorx: same @ArtyomTrityak
[1:35:49] corndogdaddi: @TheBoyChowder level cap is one of the best parts
[1:36:11] Midiosa: @Kapers_ the raids in era take less than that and can only be done once a week.  what's your point?  SOD people have tons of alts and do the raid multiple times, just like people do for raids in era
[1:36:11] Ranzorx: im going to burn myself out on these 10 man dungeons and not get to see the actual raids KEKW
[1:36:14] fudleh: new cap today
[1:36:17] fudleh: we 40 now!
[1:36:23] ArtyomTrityak: and then you do 30 min raid that will make things irrelevant in 2 months once new phase drops
[1:36:31] gryphsx: I might level to 60 once it‚Äôs 50% bonus xp all the way up
[1:36:39] fudleh: pog!
[1:36:40] peonprime: pvpers are the biggest cry babies.
[1:36:47] Roomkaasje: i could already farm winterfall ekos today for 2 hours straight without getting pvpd
[1:36:49] Albrick: SoD brought a lot of my Vanilla Guild back together into the game. Lots of Dad-players by now who appreciate the slow pace :D
[1:36:50] Roomkaasje: so seems hopefull
[1:36:50] Ranzorx: yeah they are going the route of "make everything from previous phases irrelevant in the next phase"
[1:36:57] fudleh: they added a exp buff for low levels to help alts and such
[1:36:58] Liidocaine: I hate leveling.... plus wasnt able to get on a server where my friends are since kekw day job. so it lost its luster quickly
[1:37:06] TheBoyChowder: @Ranzorx exactly
[1:37:17] fudleh: Im loving goofy craft.  but you gota embrace the goof to have fun
[1:37:41] deskjob_: payoAc
[1:37:42] fudleh: its just retail in our world that we know and love
[1:37:44] fudleh: lets be real
[1:37:48] ArtyomTrityak: I feel like SOD streamers / video recorders hype is overrated and is just for farming views and pushing fake hype
[1:38:17] rioisk: SoD is the "it" content though
[1:38:39] 3Riven: sod is dad gamer chill now but will get sweaty when 40 mans are out
[1:38:40] Midiosa: I like the fact that you play a different version of wow than I do these days.  I wouldn't want to play retail/SOD all day and then come watch you play it too lol
[1:38:41] fudleh: SOD nerf hitting era monka?!?!
[1:38:42] Eribo7: What ya farming them for?
[1:38:43] fudleh: jk
[1:38:43] ekiprkl: like they would bother. they're too busy making SoD worse
[1:38:45] hazzqt: how about a qol change to add more arcane crystals Dentge
[1:39:06] rioisk: they should just add a merchant that sells arcane crystals for copper
[1:39:07] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[1:39:14] lintyjoo: dragonflight obviously
[1:39:18] Ranzorx: I was hoping all these characters ive leveled would eventually carry over to Era lol. understandable but now I kinda want to play less and just level more warrs on era
[1:39:32] PopcornRDY: they moved all the crystals to SoD :D
[1:39:37] mrcrujones: SoD is feeling really bloated like retail, feels bad
[1:39:38] slupo: slupo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 17 month streak! 
[1:39:53] ArtyomTrityak: even SOD streamers stopped streaming SOD because there is nothing to do and it is boring. They just record videos of "what must you do to prepare for next phase"
[1:39:56] fudleh: just wait till we take your herbs
[1:40:54] ekiprkl: hopefully they let them transfer the chars to retail where they belong
[1:40:58] Ranzorx: its not shocking but it happened with SoM so w/e
[1:41:05] panjack13: My hot take is that retail class design is better than SOD rn
[1:41:14] fudleh: yea its just retail but in classic world.
[1:41:17] R_GraM_: level gated content not ideal
[1:41:18] Uki88: tribalism is one of the dumbest shit that humans still cling to
[1:41:21] sprite_drinker10: @Ranzorx wait so SoD toons wont be able to xfer to era once SoD is done with?
[1:41:28] R_GraM_: I‚Äôm trying to hit max level and end game stuff asap
[1:41:28] panjack13: SOD feels like midway between classic and retail
[1:41:32] knobiking: I played SoD because it's the closest thing to F R E S H that we will get in a while. I leveled almost all classes, tried the runes and had fun. Around midway through phase 1 my motivation was gone because it does not feel like vanilla.
[1:41:40] Ranzorx: @sprite_drinker10 yeah they will be stuck on some shitty sod era or something lol
[1:41:48] fudleh: every phase is like an expansion pack rather then new tier
[1:41:59] fudleh: bc of level cap going up
[1:42:23] jlegretta: my videogame version is the best one and if you disagree you're inferior as a human being
[1:42:23] Hackwork: @Uki88 My side of tribalism is best
[1:42:31] Uki88: @Hackwork KEKW
[1:42:53] ArtyomTrityak: @knobiking @knobiking 100% I leveled 1 character to 25 and then it felt like 1000% different game
[1:43:23] fudleh: the main apeal of sod to me is progression
[1:43:32] fudleh: its all new content.  find new strats
[1:43:55] swedishviking345: im gonna game SoD when the first 40-man raid releases
[1:44:01] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[1:44:33] jlegretta: now because you slacked on pilla leveling, the sod level cap caught up on you and you'll get "is this sod?" questions all over again
[1:44:37] Ranzorx: I should have leveled more era toons last year when it was like 3k to boost to 60
[1:44:52] ArtyomTrityak: how much gold do you have
[1:44:53] tennismxer: Where do I find guilds that don't run gdkp.. seems like that's the only option I have
[1:44:58] ekiprkl: how many demonic runes does hilla have by now? my paladin is up to 118 but I actually do raid on him
[1:45:05] fudleh: she will save you 600 jump runs from now with that rune
[1:45:10] skaboom17: 10 man raids on 3 day lockouts make me want to quit sod
[1:45:16] HumungaaDungaa: 10 man raids are shit
[1:45:17] Ranzorx: if they go 10 man every raid im out lol
[1:45:19] ArtyomTrityak: 10-man raids feels not epic at all, not classic at all
[1:45:34] brooch_fan: is your raid getting the omen buff?
[1:45:35] skaboom17: cant wait to run my glorified UBRS every 3 days!
[1:45:41] Kapers_: Kara BIS raid ever
[1:45:41] HumungaaDungaa: 10 man = dungeon
[1:45:45] TheBoyChowder: 10 man is the worst lol
[1:45:59] ekiprkl: 10man raiding is awful. 20 and 40 is the best
[1:46:05] Ranzorx: 20/40 bis
[1:46:29] fudleh: the cool thing about 40 man is. it feels like an actual army
[1:46:34] Ranzorx: 20 for zg type raids
[1:46:35] ArtyomTrityak: 20 is /2 from 40 so easier to have raid guild
[1:46:37] leomnzzz: but it is unfeasible to have 40 or even 25 players in a raid
[1:46:55] R_GraM_: more competition with 40min
[1:46:58] HumungaaDungaa: vanilla class synergy - warrior
[1:46:59] R_GraM_: man
[1:47:01] HumungaaDungaa: KEKW
[1:47:42] Motelguy: salvdaHP
[1:47:42] dublincaterlin: really hoping for 20 -> 10 and 40 -> 20 man raids at SoD eng game
[1:47:53] Motelguy: 60man raids Prayge
[1:47:58] fudleh: yea reducing raid size does make it easier to fill out run with your best gamers
[1:48:05] HumungaaDungaa: are you gonna try SOD when its level 60 cap?
[1:48:07] Kapers_: 10 man makes it nice and ez to hop on and find a pug in 5 minutes
[1:48:32] fudleh: HAHAHAHA
[1:48:39] gryphsx: 40 mans are just so epic
[1:48:52] gryphsx: especially if the run is full of gamers
[1:49:01] Motelguy: Crazy to think for every minute in a 40 man raid, its 40 minutes of man hour being utilized
[1:49:12] ArtyomTrityak: what's your thoughts about rogue vs warrior vs mage in non-speed running naxx?
[1:49:14] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[1:49:28] fr3inst3in: 30 zugzugs charging in and dying to aoe is truly epic
[1:49:47] fudleh: they could legit just turn MC into like a 25 man with our current power level ramp up we would clear it fine
[1:50:17] ArtyomTrityak: if people not unboon whole raid but only on some bosses mages rogues seem to have an edge over warriors
[1:50:48] R_GraM_: false
[1:51:16] ArtyomTrityak: esp for bosses+trash
[1:51:39] yoooofi: POGGERS
[1:51:44] Motelguy: Stream rng EZ Clap
[1:51:45] fudleh: they do exist!
[1:51:47] Ranzorx: they are buffing power of items too not just runes
[1:51:48] AlbySmithers: POGGIES
[1:51:48] gryphsx: EZ Clap
[1:51:50] TheDanishLurker: POGGERS
[1:52:12] Drpopcorn: @fudleh i actually kind of hope they just keep everything as 10 mans - been super nice to casually run shit with the homies
[1:52:21] ArtyomTrityak: blizz watching stream and buffing arcane crystals
[1:52:44] Ranzorx: @Drpopcorn that would be the death of sod for me lol

[1:57:23] Ranzorx: this is how ive had permanent dmf on sod with its 2 week cycles lol
[1:57:23] ArazosEU: do you expect the roster to be the same for all 3 runs?
[1:57:31] racerkill: how many in the guild plays sod?
[1:57:46] fudleh: i assume its just few raid loggers that do their 2 raids a month  KEK

[2:12:16] ArazosEU: whats better, goblin or gnomish rocket boots?
[2:12:16] Motelguy: !alt
[2:12:19] Motelguy: !alts
[2:12:19] Nightbot: Dalvsali and Pilla are Dali's newest alts on Classic Era. The plan is to ultimately use the warrior as a GDKP alt. The Paladin solely exists to healbot the warrior, no plans to raid on it.
[2:12:44] R_GraM_: I tank 20 mans stay dps for 40 mans
[2:12:54] R_GraM_: sometimes tank a Mc
[2:13:16] Motelguy: Is paladin tanking a meme even if the player is really good?
[2:13:31] Midiosa: I tanked AQ GDKPs on Skeram back in classic.  Such a cushy job
[2:13:33] ArazosEU: so goblin is better, but if they break sometimes, its not worth enchanting them then?
[2:14:05] knobiking: paladin is good enough to tank dungeons and pugs, but not more
