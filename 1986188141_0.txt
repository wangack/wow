[1:37:48] shinigamidyo: The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.

I used to farm enough gold to buy tokens and pay for my monthly subscriptions....for me and my ex boyfriend. I paid for our expansions that way too. In retail it is too expensive to buy a token on the auction house with goldnow. It was fun while it lasted.

His positioning, his squirrel brain, just isn't cut out to be a tank. However, this can't all be blamed on him, as it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts and you just want to lay down and cry.

[2:38:13] ditchdigger456: Cdank  is an actual agent, I swear to God. I've seen him not only get himself killed but also many others in groups and raids. His positioning, his squirrel brain, just isn't cut out to be a tank. However, this can't all be blamed on him, as it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts and you just want to lay down and cry.

[3:52:17] n0dders_: The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains a difference or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviation to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position that it wasn't, it now is.

[5:40:31] Shylupe: it's so weird...I heard you guys talking about Zin'rokh and it reminded me that I hadn't transmogged mine on my DK since the new expac dropped. It's gone. poof, mysteriously vanished.  I didn't farm it though, so it isn't a devastating loss: I got it by accident when farming something else in archeology. I didn't even know what it was until my guildie flipped out over the acquisition when it showed up in guild chat. It still sucks though. It was pretty.
