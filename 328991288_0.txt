[2:50:09] Shidious: Why does Blizzard allow tournament players access to gear vendors but force players on the live game to suffer through unfair games caused by gear discrepancies? Real players are forced to grind gear in order to compete in arena, yet the tournament players have access to normalized gear for fairness.
