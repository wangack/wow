[1:47:06] LSBreed: the chest/helm/head all have 2ndary stats which would be better come SL anyway.
[1:47:10] Drakenking: I had fun with it
[1:47:13] MetallicusGaming: FLManPlays they'll be disabled in SL zones
[1:47:16] Killaabeez: @FLManPlays ofc

[1:47:27] xDreddx: maybe when it drops
[1:47:29] BrowneePoints: @Towelliee The consensus is that it's pretty, but there's not much there
[1:47:32] IronPhalanX: the next anthem
[1:47:36] kbeltz85: The looter genre is getting stale. Too saturated of a market
[1:47:40] Drakenking: @sharie the combat really builds as you level the skills are a big part of unlocking actual combat functions
[1:47:40] griffdog125: ots just very bright

[1:48:20] theoneeleven: yea looter shooter almost as saturated as battle royales right now
[1:48:26] MetallicusGaming: Nesicc as a casual yes somewhere around that
[1:48:36] BearOfLight: I mean, Godfall's story isn't anything special - but the gameplay feels super good imo. I'm enjoying it a lot
[1:48:40] studoge66: How about Destiny how have you liked that expac @Towelliee
[1:48:52] falldrgn: people do this crap with every game. Avengers.. Destiny.. etc.. They clear it in an hour then bitch that theres nothing to do.

[2:05:32] Ulby42: @towelliee I was on wowhead and saw most posts from who I assume are top rated players at their respected classes and a majority say kyrian is the strongest covenant. Do you think this will stay true or is more tuning coming?

[2:21:10] soundpraenk: @Zettabyte yeah, leveling is pretty slow, that's true, even combat, but when you reach max level and do end game content, oh oh, i had problems to react to some mechanics, so many buttons to press too, was really confusing
[2:21:12] jbeastb: I'm sorry... I tried FF14 it was a SNOOZE FEST and the combat is zzzzzzzzzzz
[2:21:14] northcub: I can see a PS5 in the background but you are playing WoW/

[2:21:26] PToastman: I enjoyed shadowbringers plenty but it wasn’t really revolutionary lol

[2:21:29] SensationalBanana: bUt FfXiV ReQuIrEs 190 IQ!!
[2:21:31] MagicMooseMoo: The the mainstory quest in FF can be a little bit of a trek
[2:21:34] BearOfLight: I mean it had a LOT of story, but it was such a GREAT story.
[2:21:34] soundpraenk: @Zettabyte was definitely harder for me than wow end game content
[2:21:35] BerserkerkerBoy: @Towelliee why horde though?
[2:21:37] Chrysophylax_I: @Towelliee thanks for the Gfuel recommend. Peach Rings is soooo good
[2:21:38] Asuo_: It became a single player game. Which is not what you go into that game for at that point

[2:22:07] Karn1987: @Towelliee what modle mic is that

[2:30:14] Drakenking: LUL
[2:30:23] Masqerader: Oddly I don't feel the hype and know its happening, that isn't to say I am disappointed in the game or think its gonna be bad, just not excited as I normally get for a release

[2:39:34] HagermanHour: demons is mostly easier
[2:39:37] ShadoodHD: demon's souls a remake from the original from what i read
[2:39:39] Zettabyte: @Towelliee Demon Souls should be a great drinking game, a shot every time you die Kappa

[2:39:45] Toon11: lol
[2:39:48] swordwindgaming: I don't know about PS5 DS, but original DS is one of the easier games.
[2:39:50] Dyriks: wait you can do that in godfall?
[2:39:50] Xailen: its easier but a more clunky
[2:39:52] Tazzyy: digital deluxe helps
[2:40:01] FattBeard: Towelliee should be doing sloots bet but against Quinn.

[2:40:29] unstoppablelv: Whats the best Mage spec nowdays?

[2:41:55] GeoMachinaX: also i think warzone merged CW and MW together if im not mistaken, so warzone is still its own thing

[3:55:56] Sonatta: @Gorestack for now... but they're working on scanning live streams too so why bother
[3:55:56] GnomeLickerGames: i heard they working on putting out a way for them to do it live
[3:56:05] SeckSymbols: I dont know what Facebook gaming does because why the hell would I watch a stream on Facebook
[3:56:07] CIPher38652: Prime music is an individual license. Not a Group listen license.
[3:56:18] icemanj99: DMCA is old in antiquated anyway. It hasn't been adapted for the 21st century
[3:56:26] SeckSymbols: I know some people do but...barf
[3:56:30] Dcarter: dont have to watch they posted their ongoings
[3:56:33] Dcarter: i dont but i saw what theyve done
[3:56:37] EpicJune: dang, they going hard
[3:56:41] Arcahan: I hope the music industry collapses nothing of value would be lost
[3:56:44] Chrysophylax_I: Whats with the 50 minute Brawl que?
[3:56:49] Sh4nti: Facebook bought music licensing so you can stream with music playing
[3:56:56] Mecabeast: what about the live games on Thursdays that are on prime video
[3:57:13] leshiltv: Hasan watches the news on stream all the time

[3:57:22] mrniceguy817: Dansgaming said live dmca bots will be very soon
[3:57:25] Gorestack: that's some next level CCCP secret police shit
[3:57:27] NerdyTeK: the vods are stored in a cache even when you delete it they can still be found . devin nash already showed this
[3:57:31] MILESkg21: Hasan also gets permission to do so :)
[3:57:42] CIPher38652: Will Nintendo go back on their shit about takedowns?
[3:57:44] kaylis_hayasei: did they just get lazy or something? didnt they just mute the copyrighted parts of a stream?
[3:57:46] Meshindale: 3-strikes and you're IN
[3:57:52] SeckSymbols: @MilesKG21 Permission to do what?
[3:57:56] EpicJune: heard Sum had 3
[3:57:57] Lightian: 3 strikes and you have to generate enough income to be not out? @Towelliee
[3:57:59] Reckless_Monk: @Towelliee this dude Geekan is working on a platform to help you guys.
[3:57:59] TheCliffyShow: Three strikes and you're out unless you make Twitch a lot of money.
[3:58:00] NerdyTeK: i mean it happened to all of us twitch dont really del it
[3:58:08] Reckless_Monk: @Towelliee He tweeted that hes working on it
[3:58:09] NerdyTeK: they are temp stored
[3:58:09] RagingPunk: hopefuly they make games with a streamer mode in the future
[3:58:14] Sh4nti: He got a dmca too
[3:58:17] CIPher38652: Waiting for Alinity DMCA
[3:58:17] Sh4nti: A warning
[3:58:21] CIPher38652: Kappa
[3:58:26] Sonatta: DMCA is not stupid, it's there to keep billion dollar companies like Pepsi from using some indie band's music in their next ad campaign without paying for it
[3:58:31] Ekvision: for ingame sound?
[3:58:34] Antdavs24: like the in game acoustics?!?! jesus thats absurd
[3:58:44] UltimaWeap: so does that confirm some wow sound effects are actually outsourced? ;)
[3:58:45] Angelraven13: Senjin village drums.
[3:58:46] HeathenCellist: @CIPHER38652 No strike limit for Alinity Kappa
[3:58:47] Sh4nti: Yeah it was "wind howling sound" or something
[3:58:55] SeckSymbols: DMCA is stupid, there is no other way to put it
[3:59:04] NerdyTeK: the way people are getting hit even if they del it is because they are not fully deleted idk y
[3:59:04] MILESkg21: TheScubaSteve693 the news streams
[3:59:06] Dyriks: WutFace
[3:59:12] Reckless_Monk: @Towelliee A coder who was showing how Twitch keeps clips and deleted vods
[3:59:14] Antdavs24: breathing DMCA Kappa
[3:59:14] CIPher38652: So blizzard is breaking DMCA? :O
[3:59:14] rimo82: theres a difference between a streamer having background music than pepsi doing some mass marketing @Sonatta
[3:59:17] nksttv: l

[3:59:26] cataJJ: dotn dmca me bro
[3:59:29] StoicTaurus: I have seen VoD muted, for "Police syrene" in Persona5
[3:59:30] NerdyTeK: yes that swhat i was trying to say
[3:59:34] Murlock07: lol
[3:59:37] Dcarter: our characters arent wiped btw
[3:59:42] silitung: I am gonna copyright footsteps next
[3:59:46] Sonatta: @Soaxs8383 under the law a streamer using music without permission is no different than pepsi
[3:59:48] SeckSymbols: Destiny servers are still down :(
[3:59:51] captain_steve_rogers: When will DMCA get DMCA. That will be the end of this
[3:59:52] maccaruso: Maccaruso subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Boom, looking forward to Shadowlands marathon!
[3:59:52] Moobot: @MACCARUSO with the 16 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[3:59:59] eyemyor: Ape beats his chest, DMCA from Harambe.
[4:00:01] MizixTV: DMCA is a necessary evil to protect the music industry... without DMCA people could stream music and Artists and Record labels would lose out on money. That would be like me creating a channel and just streaming Towelliee's content and profiting of it...
[4:00:01] CozzyFlannel: technically tho streamers arent even allowed to use the copyrighted content live. Its just if you delete the vod they cant review footage later. But if they catch you live they can still take you down
[4:00:02] thrillersan: dcwMonka dcwMonka dcwMonka dcwMonka
[4:00:03] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @BaldNed (warning)
[4:00:06] CIPher38652: I think if it wasnt so draconic it would be better. Have a Review process.
[4:00:08] melkizgud: Is retail even good anymore..?
[4:00:14] LolitaAldea: @Towelliee wow sound are licensed too. Ive heard some wow sounds in films multiple times
[4:00:16] SeckSymbols: Retail better than Classic
[4:00:16] Stofflix: When is the Launch test starting ?
[4:00:17] its_pepito: i dont think dmca's inherent idea is dumb, but i think the lengths of which DMCA took their actions are very extreme, THAT is dumb
[4:00:18] TiwazFo5: they're who spawn the rares
[4:00:26] jason_tacey: They need to rework the whole DMCA..times have changed
[4:00:31] SeckSymbols: DMCA needs to change, period.
[4:00:39] NerdyTeK: dmca is an outdated bs to stop napster
[4:00:42] BearOfLight: From Walt Disney himself
[4:00:44] MILESkg21: time to rewrite the DMCA laws
[4:00:50] egraves7: 1998 was a whole different world, needs to be redone from the ground upp
[4:00:53] wickedmgg: yes for sure
[4:00:56] FergusCreative: Why not require the name and artist in your stream? Streamer plays good song, tons of people go out and buy/stream said song
[4:00:58] Dyriks: copyright free sound pack inc LUL
[4:01:00] eyemyor: It needs to be updated with the times
[4:01:03] wickedmgg: was done in early 90'2 i think
[4:01:04] HeBeDead: twitch will probably have to pay for some implementation on the backend of things
[4:01:04] raldrik: need a way to do it legally in 2020
[4:01:06] MrGrimms: @Dcarter but aren't you copying your character to a beta server? So not advantage?
[4:01:11] CozzyFlannel: does twitch have a dedicated music section?
[4:01:17] TheCliffyShow: Music distribution and techology changes a lot over 20 years.
[4:01:20] NerdyTeK: artist dont even like dmcas its the label . the artist love when we play their shit
[4:01:22] totallypayingattention: amazon being cheap about it
[4:01:22] Daggerstry: They need to make it to where in game soundtracks don't count. Like, Miles Morales uses so much popular music
[4:01:24] instant_savage: @Towelliee what covenant u going on ur brew?
[4:01:30] rimo82: there was a blue post saying that character above 50 will just be "unavailable for the duration of the test"
[4:01:32] its_pepito: @HeBeDead that ultimately is going to be the end result and probably will cost streamers revenue to help subsidize that licensing fee
[4:01:33] Csmstr: doesn't really need to change...... artists want their money man. streamers are now making 10s to 100s of thousands of dollars a month now. labels want their cut
[4:01:38] leshiltv: If I were a music artist, I would put out a blanket statement that streamers can use my music...it would benefit them.
[4:01:41] Gorestack: they're basically saying "less work for us, fuck it"

[4:01:47] Jay_Vee_NL: ofc they dont care about u streamers lmao
[4:01:56] FergusCreative: Its fucking amazon. Bezos can surrender his 50million bonus for a year to pay record companies for 5 years
[4:01:57] Jay_Vee_NL: they just care about the money that comes in
[4:01:58] NerdyTeK: hot take ... fire emmett shear
[4:01:59] HeBeDead: @its_pepito i think which is a fair compromise to some degree
[4:02:02] SeckSymbols: Honestly, Facebook Gamings DMCA policies seem so simplistic and something that twitch streamers already did for the most part
[4:02:09] AlluAA: hah gud timing for add
[4:02:09] temp3st98: AAAADD
[4:02:10] arlovski: 1/9 ads
[4:02:14] HeBeDead: to overhaul the whole system is probably unreasonable
[4:02:15] Jay_Vee_NL: nice got a shadowlands ad
[4:02:16] bonnzo79: lol add
[4:02:16] koorisin: haha forced AD right as towlliee is hammering twitch
[4:02:19] Daggerstry: 1/10 adds
[4:02:28] koorisin: 2/8 wtf
[4:02:33] Drakenking: You gotta find good DMCA free music for the dance off
[4:02:35] FireKazzak: ads WutFace
[4:02:36] thrillersan: Something that was described to me was that another reason DMCA's are so relevant was because the song is technically not getting a point towards how many times its being listened to. For like a songs rating doesn't go up proportional to the views hearing the song, and just getting the one listen
[4:02:37] Rollies: scooter omega
[4:02:37] Sonatta: doesn't make sense for Twitch to spend money developing DMCA tools and paying people to review cases... they'd rather keep hiring more community managers and such who don't do anything all day
[4:02:37] koorisin: twitch nazis in chat
[4:02:38] MagickGravity: FIIIREEE
[4:02:38] MILESkg21: no more viking dubstep :(
[4:02:40] paradoxTheDJ: No MORE SCOOTER!?!? Noooooooo'
[4:02:44] ormy86: no more Miracle :-(
[4:02:46] its_pepito: @HeBeDead knowing the greedy ass record labels though it will come with some massive red tape and will probably be very unreasonable
[4:02:54] fistofnature: AD LUL
[4:03:10] HeBeDead: yeah, there's a lot of incentive to lobby i'd imagine to keep the current system in palce

[4:03:27] CIPher38652: Tons of Ads.. can you get DMCa'd for ads that play music?
[4:03:35] koorisin: @thrillersan that sounds like conjecture at best
[4:03:37] SeckSymbols: Not if they are Twitch ads
[4:03:44] SeckSymbols: They arent actually in your stream
[4:03:45] CIPher38652: Not fiar
[4:03:50] CIPher38652: Fire*
[4:03:51] NerdyTeK: i promise tha artists aint throwing these dmcas out its the suits
[4:03:56] TheFuriyon: Got the Accursed Keepsake Pog
[4:03:58] HeBeDead: the thing is, its either get ads, or pay $20 a month to watch ad free on this platform
[4:04:09] Drakenking: @Towelliee Twitch should implement AMazon Music like they do with watch parties
[4:04:16] CIPher38652: Wait.. I don't pay for amazon prime already?
[4:04:19] Drakenking: AKA you can run a song but only prime viewers can listen to it or something like that
[4:04:25] Bammbino: F
[4:04:31] Pathoren: They're so out of touch. They think Napster is gonna make a comeback
[4:04:34] paradoxTheDJ: but you can add some DMCA corney friendly song.
[4:04:41] instant_savage: @Towelliee what covenant u going on your brewmaster, have u chose one uet
[4:04:43] thrillersan: @koorisin that's just one persons thought process as to how some dmcas work. wasn't mine
[4:04:50] readyvic: Haven't watched since delay how is shadowlands looking
[4:04:51] NerdyTeK: we can watch pretty much any video even movies on here... but music hell no
[4:04:52] MILESkg21: people will get perma banned and then switch plats LUL
[4:04:52] Steve401: so false lol

[4:04:58] HeBeDead: god damn, 10 ads tho lol
[4:05:00] Ekvision: or on music withouth dmca rights like some mozart and shit
[4:05:05] jason_tacey: I blame Napster/Limewire
[4:05:05] EpicJune: streamers might end up hiring people to do custom music
[4:05:09] IianaDRK: "dont play music and turn off game music"
[4:05:09] NerdyTeK: that vod del isnt 100% safe
[4:05:11] Drakenking: @NerdyTeK thats different, and you cant watch a lot of videos now
[4:05:15] Steve401: its very simple ? yet you have no music lol
[4:05:16] westelan_: get papas bag yet?
[4:05:19] its_pepito: @Towelliee I think a reasonable change to the DMCA laws would be to have Twitch (or whatever platform) pay a general use licensing fee for music and then that license fee would be subsidized by the streamers.
[4:05:19] Brodih_: at least be able to play ingame music... I understand playing your own music is sketch
[4:05:21] Sonatta: people didn't listen back during the great VoD/clips purge LUL
[4:05:23] FireKazzak: 10 ads PogChamp
[4:05:24] Drakenking: the difference in a watch party is that everyone has a license to view said movie @NerdyTeK
[4:05:29] TiwazFo5: so we can play music, but we just can't keep the vods?
[4:05:33] Obitualist: Is the launch test in a few hours? I'm trying to sync my lunch break with it.
[4:05:37] echoloch: i can streamers paying for custom music like they already do for layouts etc
[4:05:38] CIPher38652: MUSIC? You mean @akamikeb ?
[4:05:39] givmeafrekinname: People will still get false DMCA claims even if they made their owm music.
[4:05:43] Euny13: why not set up Amazon music into twitch?
[4:05:45] leshiltv: You can still get banned for deleted vods?
[4:05:46] Backaddict: towBeer
[4:05:56] NerdyTeK: @Drakenking then do it with music its not like the company is worth a billion or anything
[4:06:08] Sincline387: @FourtyD technically no, but no one's been busted live for it yet....at some point that might not be safe
[4:06:08] Drakenking: Amazon is now actually paying live performance fees which is how DJs and stuff are still playing
[4:06:12] Dcarter: yeah i gotta turn nba 2k21 music off
[4:06:13] callmestray: "Use code DONT-DMCA-ME-BRO for $50 off your first year." lol
[4:06:16] Andredergiant: what do you think about the music app by twitch?
[4:06:19] NerdyTeK: @callmestray lol
[4:06:22] Meshindale: is this your 50th for P30? @Towelliee

[4:06:32] FireKazzak: can u get DMCA'd if u play music from Monstercat ?
[4:06:53] geokouts: any luck for Stream Raiders?
[4:06:58] Clicklesly: I'm just surprised there's really so much music played on Twitch, i remember early on i liked finding streamers that didn't play any so i could play my own stuff in the background ^^
[4:06:59] MILESkg21: just mute game audio 4Head great answer
[4:07:01] NerdyTeK: then they wont make shit for money . cause look at drake travis scott logic all them
[4:07:02] Sonatta: you pay for a license to use Monstercat music @FireKazzak
[4:07:07] MizixTV: @Towelliee Agreed.... when developers decide to create a game and put something in the game, THEY should be responsible.... not the streamer
[4:07:11] Bereghost: Coming from a youtube content creator that does this for a living, it's just been my daily routine to MUTE all music with games..has been this way since 2011 for me..
[4:07:17] Zomgboy: Hows the food prep going for shadowlands @Towelliee ?

[4:12:40] Snatchinupyokids: I've heard of some people paying like $2000+ for only like 50 songs
[4:12:43] totallypayingattention: be worth it for amazon to pay it
[4:12:44] Zantex0: you would end up having to have a broadcast license but you don't have iheartradios pricing deal
[4:12:47] echoloch: monkaS
[4:13:00] captain_steve_rogers: its a few thousand a year its a broadcaster's license
[4:13:12] Lorewyn: not to mention i would bet theres a duration on how long you could play their music for @Towelliee
[4:13:17] MILESkg21: healing as shadow monkaS
[4:13:34] HeBeDead: shadow seems pretty good now
[4:13:53] fyre97_: im loving destro warlock
[4:13:59] MizixTV: @Xilice its just like a bar having to pay per person to show a UFC PPV.... you get charged a certain amount of money person that will be viewing the content.... in a bar case its based on capacity of the based on legal limitations.... when it comes to a streamer the number of viewers would be infinite...
[4:14:16] its_pepito: i'm leveling an enhancement shaman and it feels a lot like a faceroll
[4:14:16] Moobot: towW HEY CHAT! Do you have a funny clip of towelliee? Subs AND non subs can now post clips in the clips section of discord! We strongly encourage everyone to get involved to post funny clips of towelliee for future intros and events! towShappens

[4:14:27] SeckSymbols: Shadow is my main spec for SL, I randomized EVERY spec in the randomizer and got shadow priest. Same class I stated BFA with
[4:14:38] CIPher38652: Multiboxers that use illegal programs are the only ones that will be getting hit
[4:14:43] MILESkg21: get yeeted LUL
[4:14:47] Fugazi811: Can't resist pulling eh?
[4:15:02] Ekvision: dot dot dot
[4:15:07] banishtyrion: dont forget to clear the next room before going to the boss :P
[4:15:28] Waspire: its being toned down
[4:15:39] captain_steve_rogers: plus the ones that spam trade chat
[4:15:41] Sincline387: multiboxing is not against the rules, using input software is.
[4:15:54] CaptainTVBot: backaddict just purchased a Towelliee Flag Bearer for $5.00! Thank you for supporting the channel!
[4:15:59] HeBeDead: but the only way to really multibox is with input software no?
[4:16:00] HeathenCellist: How do people actually afford multiboxing? Shit aint cheap
[4:16:02] druidfann: is it worth gearing up for next expa?
[4:16:03] bullymikko: Botting is huge problem atm
[4:16:03] Xilice: @MizixTV at the same time programs on TV can make it work, so i dont believe it's impossible, though quite possibly not worth it at all atleast for small streams
[4:16:03] MILESkg21: yeah its not 20 druids just farming anymore LUL
[4:16:04] Sincline387: you basically can't use software to give commands to multiple accounts
[4:16:10] PopeJonas: Found some guy on twitch that was multiboxing 45 characters. He payed for all of them with gold and still had a truckload of gold left.
[4:16:19] TheCliffyShow: I saw a huge group of Boomkins like a week ago in Darkshore spamming starfall. It was obivously automated.
[4:16:24] CIPher38652: Its supposed to be 1 keypress = 1 action
[4:16:25] AJPro: You can alt-tab like crazy if you want
[4:16:27] LazyDynamics: one possible way would be a paid music service by twitch for streamers themselves, as in they get the licenses from the labels for twitch only
[4:16:28] HeathenCellist: @Kingsperg That's a metric shit ton of gold
[4:16:31] NerdyTeK: druid mb is nuts
[4:16:51] Hanndul: 16th WutFace
[4:16:54] Shrenko: @TheCliffyShow a week ago yeah, before they implemented the rules
[4:16:57] instant_savage: that was for terrien abuse tho
[4:16:59] Attackroot: towWipe_SG
[4:17:05] captain_steve_rogers: There is alot of multi-boxing on retail, especially Alliance. RUIN is built on it
[4:17:13] CIPher38652: A lot of the kids playing classic I thought were people that got banned from live servers

[4:17:26] HeBeDead: is it because multiboxing adversely affects the ingame economy?
[4:17:27] FergusCreative: clipping and jumping
[4:17:30] instant_savage: i have no clue
[4:17:31] TheCliffyShow: @Shrenko I think it was after they announced the rule.
[4:17:31] sklingel: wall climbing
[4:17:33] Sincline387: getting to places you can't get to normally to gain an advantage
[4:17:35] Antdavs24: when you hate on high elevation
[4:17:36] CrerisRs: you walljump out of bounds and shit, clip through, glitch into walls etc
[4:17:38] Cixah: going thru walls and mining from underneat etc
[4:17:43] Amarlian: wall climbing to get a peak at the next expansion
[4:17:43] echoloch: the future of mmos is probably botting honestly
[4:17:44] bob2305: jumping up to spots in pvp where they shouldn't be
[4:17:44] EpicJune: beating that terrains ass
[4:17:44] HeathenCellist: Basically exploits
[4:17:46] splic3r0: @Towelliee What if Pandora had an option where you pay lets just say a high number , like $200 a month to have access to liscense mucis for streaming. Would you pay it do it that way?
[4:17:48] bob2305: mostly pvp
[4:17:48] instant_savage: u cant parkour in wow lol
[4:17:51] Sincline387: PVP or avoiding trash
[4:17:52] Clicklesly: WSG probably?
[4:17:55] reeiven: bugging bosses, and PVP
[4:17:56] Morpheusx25: so they wanted the (high) ground
[4:18:00] Punchenbag: WSG flag carrier
[4:18:00] sprhealz: @towelliee was having trouble with my rotation on shadow do you just have to cast devouring plague every time it’s up?
[4:18:03] MILESkg21: Exploiting a 16 year old bug LUL
[4:18:09] CrerisRs: arent entire guilds glitching through walls near BWL entrance to dispel peoples world buffs?
[4:18:10] Warcraft_Whims: They obviously tried to get to GM Island
[4:18:10] CIPher38652: Pvp Mechanics. Stealing Mining Nodes

[4:18:36] Sincline387: don't be normal classic players, just send me your stuff before they ban you
[4:18:36] Jay_Vee_NL: people cry way too much
[4:18:37] dv_domino: classic players are normal?
[4:18:43] Reckless_Monk: "We want a challenge.. but we also want easy loot"
[4:18:44] Gioozey: why can't you just be normal... "REEEEEE" I love that movie XD
[4:18:45] TheCliffyShow: If they were normal they would be playing retail and not a 16 year old version of the game.
[4:18:52] CrerisRs: its ironic seeing the more casual game being a lot more hypercompetitive and so riddled with cheaters tho
[4:18:52] veetz21: cause they want that nostalgia kappa
[4:18:56] Antdavs24: lol they should have just stayed on private servers at this rate KEKW
[4:18:58] vera_yuna: @Towelliee Sounds like ur just mad
[4:18:58] CIPher38652: That's what I always felt about private serves. Just a bunch of Banned people pretending to play wow
[4:18:59] MizixTV: @Towelliee Oh snap! My Horde Slouchie from the new BlizzGear items just got here!
[4:19:01] NerdyTeK: thats y they want no changes .. so they can use all the old cheats
[4:19:01] RageFit: private servers were more normal than blizzard classic its kinda sad
[4:19:03] YungDizzY: Retail: Why can u just be normal??
[4:19:04] HeBeDead: some men want to watch the world burn
[4:19:05] HeathenCellist: Classic is honestly fun as hell. Its a challenge, but it is strangely relaxing
[4:19:08] bob2305: you mean actually play the game? WutFace
[4:19:12] YungDizzY: Classic: REEEEEEE
[4:19:30] totallypayingattention: a lot less people on private servers
[4:19:36] WonkaWash: for me the action is the juice
[4:19:37] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[4:19:46] Got2bekidding: healers be healing
[4:19:57] CIPher38652: DONATION ITEMS ON private servers.. of course
[4:20:07] HeathenCellist: I mean the point of classic was for people who didn't want change
[4:20:36] NerdyTeK: cuz the game is boring ass hell and they cant fly so they wall skip lol
[4:21:06] Bammbino: @Towelliee How do you see the grind in Shadowlands? Are we getting weekly caps or endless farming of AP?
[4:21:07] HeathenCellist: Back when hacking was a fancy term for finding the one spot where the terrain didn't connnect, jumping 50 times, then somehow getting under the map for 5 minutes
[4:21:13] HeathenCellist: Uber haxor man
[4:21:13] its_pepito: @HeathenCellist it was nostalgia for me, not change
[4:21:30] 2Kobe8: Shadow priest so fun
[4:21:40] bodli1125: for thath i just played on fun private server with full custom content and level 255
[4:21:42] elderikp: If people need to cheat to feel good, dont we have a problem at that point?
[4:21:44] TheUnknowing: corruption is very common within private servers, that and cash grabs.
[4:22:18] zulkhanis: D:
[4:22:31] toobaked1987: Are you on Stormrage? I wanna join high times
[4:22:36] HeathenCellist: @its_pepito Its a weird combination of nostalgia and spite for me lol. I played classic when I was like 8 and basically stupid to the point where I couldn't find my way back to quest givers because I had like zero short term memory. Now I play classic because its fun and to prove I can do it LUL
[4:23:04] BrutalBlueberry: I just wanna play Torghast
[4:23:13] sinlesssinner: what s the ilvl of the quest items at the beginning of the leveling experience? @Towelliee
[4:23:15] SGammer2142: Is this going to be a good expansion for casual players, Towelliee? your opinion
[4:23:18] keiko813: O_O
[4:23:20] Muffinpants4: @Towelliee do we know how long it takes to hig revered with the factions? for flasks and feast patterns?
[4:23:26] HeBeDead: lick it Kreygasm
[4:23:31] Xilice: @Towelliee why would you actually go for 9 xD!
[4:23:34] aliceuwu_x: 9 Kreygasm
[4:23:35] HeathenCellist: @Towelliee Dont tell me what to lick, Towel
[4:23:37] MILESkg21: cuz you can only pick 1 in the end LUL
[4:23:39] smashwow: licky and sticky
[4:23:42] Gragnar: I'll be fine with 6
[4:23:43] PvtHudson093: fuck doing 9 i hate pvp
[4:23:46] Dyriks: why have 1 main, when you can have 10 Kappa
[4:23:46] Zettabyte: Nine! Nine! Nine!
[4:23:49] CIPher38652: NEIN
[4:23:53] Thirdheaven: why do 1 useless mythic+ dungeon when you can do 10
[4:23:57] sinlesssinner: like my 100 ilvl scourge event gear is replaceble asap, yea?
[4:23:58] smashwow: yeah a 9 for 1 isn't that good
[4:23:59] totallypayingattention: ill be fine with 1 or 2
[4:24:01] hooch12: !follow
[4:24:02] kramer_1996: ill be fine with my 6 from raid and M+ lol
[4:24:04] IianaDRK: i dont think incentives are a bad thing
[4:24:06] EthicalHermit: im in my 30's, that doesnt work on me anymore
[4:24:08] grizzlyhorn: 9 is an upside down 6 and if you put 6 and 9 together its the sex number Kreygasm 9
[4:24:14] elderikp: Do a full HC clear and 5 M+ is probably enough
[4:24:17] BigLoe: !ui
[4:24:17] Moobot: We have a new, updated Towelliee UI! Grab it now HERE: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK. Dont forget to make backups!
[4:24:27] HeBeDead: Pogchamp I'm average!
[4:24:40] NerdyTeK: good
[4:24:41] MILESkg21: CASUALS UNITE HYPERS
[4:24:56] LekeroleN: ...so far
[4:24:57] MrGrimms: HAS
[4:24:58] LekeroleN: Kappa
[4:24:58] Morpheusx25: after the dumpster fire that is BFA, they have to make SLs good lol
[4:24:58] elderikp: It's about time to they made choices for the average player
[4:24:59] Dcarter: dcwMhm
[4:25:03] Spartyy_: i think the new leveling is saving the game a little bit tbh. Its so nice to be able to play more characters and not have to put DAYS to do it
[4:25:10] MILESkg21: if they dont add ISLANDS then we good Kappa
[4:25:10] SGammer2142: your getting me stoked dude, looking forward to it. I have the whole week off for launch! :)
[4:25:15] MOXP: hmmmmm
[4:25:15] 無職提督: poor shammy
[4:25:24] RudeMood: I mean, to be fair, it should never be about the one percent. They can work with the one percent any time for high end content, the rest of the game needs to be playable before that.
[4:25:26] BrowneePoints: @Towelliee Broken as in over 50% of all classes wanting to go Kyrian cuz of Pelagos?
[4:25:26] jdhavok93: @towelliee what about people that work everyday and don't get to play for a living less drops makes it harder for them?
[4:25:30] smashwow: or you're a monk and it hasn't worked since alpha @Towelliee
[4:25:35] Daveybutter: Nothing will ever top Wrath for me.
[4:25:42] HeBeDead: how does towelliee have THREE 1000+ sub gifters, that's WILD
[4:25:44] Cyntech89: Do as much as your RL tells you :p
[4:25:48] Ldysansa: You know whats GREAT is wr can level any place we want.
[4:25:57] geokouts: so basically for casual players it will be VERY intersting
[4:26:00] LazyDynamics: do you really think that 1%ers have to farm more then in BFA? the island farm was really nuts
[4:26:03] elderikp: you can farm 6 sockets
[4:26:08] Got2bekidding: except for lvling. you've got to go this-a-way > > > >
[4:26:10] QutipzTV: static
[4:26:11] BearOfLight: static
[4:26:15] cabalish: consistent
[4:26:32] xxOgre22xx: that right, better pick scryer so you don't partake in the poisoned victory party soup
[4:26:36] sinlesssinner: how about missions table style system? is it in SL at the end game?
[4:26:45] RhadigarTV: Good morning @Towelliee and chat! Hammers Up for the launch test today!
[4:26:50] SGammer2142: thank goodness
[4:26:54] Getitonthelow: streamline
[4:27:08] sinlesssinner: and WQs, is their ilvl rewards worth, or they done after the first few months of the expac?
[4:27:14] MILESkg21: your sack is full KEKW
[4:27:16] Madnezz123: weekly chest still gives mythic gear right?
[4:27:26] JackBlaque: so, did we settle on Torgue as the abbreviation for Torghast?
[4:27:27] LekeroleN: towDynt
[4:27:27] Moobot: Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE MAW HAMMER shirt is LIVE! Only around for 14 Days! https://www.dbh.la/mawhammer
[4:27:30] Getitonthelow: so there's no point in doing M+?
[4:27:36] cabalish: ahhh love
[4:27:46] MOXP: @sinlesssinner imo they scale same as in bfa
[4:27:51] BrutalBlueberry: Buy a token LUL
[4:28:08] Getitonthelow: will there be any gear set bonuses
[4:28:13] Lulaboo: uh
[4:28:16] kewlguy777: 5 higherish i think
[4:28:17] magemaster225: heroic level but titanforging and corruptin
[4:28:19] elderikp: M+ is fine :) you can get nice gear from it
[4:28:19] sinlesssinner: @schilder kk i see
[4:28:21] Lulaboo: None of the characters are higher than 7
[4:28:22] Dcarter: no M+ to get the achievement and for the vault
[4:28:23] Madnezz123: but completing a 15 will reward a mythic piece on the weekly chest
[4:28:23] Aervyper: add to that the whole NO titanforging
[4:28:24] Xilice: @Towelliee only higher in this patch normally equal
[4:28:26] Dcarter: do*
[4:28:33] kramer_1996: ^
[4:28:38] MILESkg21: probably not at 7 LUL

[4:50:20] Drakenking: Yes do it at 11 am on a friday when everyone is still at work
[4:50:21] CrimsonNurse: No way you get 30k
[4:50:22] imjorman: that seems small to me
[4:50:25] Jm3llow: if it's Open Beta... yeah..
[4:50:27] Drakenking: Not 6 pm on a friday
[4:50:27] jason_tacey: maybe
[4:50:27] W4stex: launch will be horrendous, we already know that 😁
[4:50:30] tsktsk: imagine if they developed a Beta Launch Pet/Mount for those who participate in this test? the turn out would be very huge
[4:50:32] Srbi96: Put it on the ptr realms and you'll see 20k
[4:50:39] TheFabilolz: @MilesKG21 Who the fuck am i suppose to know who the fuck is Dave Chapelle as a french dude ?....
[4:50:43] givmeafrekinname: maybe 500 max
[4:50:43] TheFuriyon: @Zarvren16 2 years ago, shit was still down for hours
[4:50:44] XshadowturkeyX: illidan area52 hyjal, stormrage, proudmoore and made a couple more are gonnae die on launch
[4:50:45] cineris_3: might get to 1k
[4:50:46] Teknofear64: what's the incentive?
[4:51:05] Zarvren88: @TheFuriyon I gave up after about 5-6 hours
[4:51:09] DanH190: guys is there a mod that shows when your dots expire?

[4:51:14] Tyrandian: What time is the test?
[4:51:16] MILESkg21: @TheFabilolz https://youtu.be/FclScfPoKes here :)
[4:51:20] MizixTV: @Teknofear64 the incentive is to have a good launch on November 23rd....
[4:51:27] parlangua89: I really do hope blizzard proves all these fucking haters wrong. I’m so sick with the negativity of blizzard and blah blah blah.
[4:51:29] CrimsonNurse: You would get so many more if you invited those that have not been on beta yet... come on blizzard this is not hard to understand
[4:51:38] smashwow: if a cert server shits the bed. good luck launch day.
[4:51:41] Zomgboy: icecrown is already laggy when 100ths of ppl wait at byojarm or w/e its called
[4:51:51] Apheelia: If they want a launch test let US all in!
[4:51:55] TheFuriyon: @TheFuriyon I stuck through it and didn't go to sleep till I hit 120 14 hours after launch, 9 hours roughly after Draenor restabilized
[4:51:58] Snurp90: @Towelliee which dps was most fun for you in your lvling runs?
[4:52:01] gagepw: @PlebDan youre going to want weak auras, decent amount of set up but its really worth it to learn
[4:52:02] MILESkg21: it was WOD AND MOP that were the shit shows
[4:52:06] smashwow: @Zomgboy that's at each rare not just for bag boy
[4:52:10] yoshikimoko: how long till the test?
[4:52:17] keeindordel: 4 mins
[4:52:24] M_i_x_e_r: dont u remember the looting of the poision in the inn at the start of bfa
[4:52:29] parlangua89: Bfa was fine it just got ddosded to shit
[4:52:30] CrumbySmash: considering the amount of resources I think that is quite reasonable
[4:52:32] Zomgboy: yeah true garfrost and the guy that fears were awful too
[4:52:33] M_i_x_e_r: i member
[4:52:34] ElDrakenMan: BFA launch was pretty good too
[4:52:34] KillaPr0: always going to be problems
[4:52:36] keeindordel: @Towelliee u doing warmode?
[4:52:41] Putcride: Wod launch was interesting
[4:52:46] jasperboy: OMW
[4:52:50] givmeafrekinname: 50
[4:52:53] nocturnal_2195: not enough
[4:52:54] Clicklesly: They should've done this on the original launch date though Kappa
[4:52:54] itsNODDERS: whats happening right now? is he on the pts?
[4:52:55] MILESkg21: its so blurry LUL
[4:52:56] tezrelli: 50 maybe
[4:52:56] Mostdangspy: @Towelliee they cant be as bad as EQ launching new servers. The last one people couldn't play for 8 to 10 hours, they just kept going down
[4:52:57] TheFuriyon: 50-75 I reckon
[4:52:58] Zomgboy: am I drunk?
[4:53:06] Zomgboy: or do i have to set my graphics
[4:53:13] CrimsonNurse: Like maybe 40
[4:53:18] Tyrandian: Let's forget WoD's. XD
[4:53:18] MattJ063: why be on right now, the even dont start for another 2 hours
[4:53:19] CasketFreshx: type /who

[4:53:30] Thugbabyjeesus: why dont blizzard re do wow in unreal engine 4!! i dont get it and fix the servers KAPOW Kreygasm CarlSmile
[4:53:31] swervity82: what is this for?
[4:53:32] Rugmanimus: stays the same in Org whether WM on or off
[4:53:32] paulson14: ya area 52 is going to explode
[4:53:35] MILESkg21: WM doesnt change in cities LUL
[4:53:41] Horuseternal69: do /who ogri that'll give you 50 results as a minimum xD
[4:53:41] dynamicbb: what do you think is the best tank combo for raiding first tier of SL
[4:53:44] TheCliffyShow: Looks like Orgrimmar turned into Orgymmar.
[4:53:47] smegarol: @Towelliee look, ten days isn't that long in our times. I'm talking about the release of Shadowland
[4:53:47] Aidler: the worst start I remember was MOP
[4:53:48] imjorman: I got the chapelle show opening song in my head
[4:53:55] imjorman: well "song" anyway
[4:53:59] M_i_x_e_r: @Towelliee do you remember that loads of ppl couldnt loot the poison in the inn at the start of bfa
[4:54:00] parlangua89: Mop was the worse launch ever
[4:54:01] Drogdorf: KEKW
[4:54:03] Shrenko: CouldYouNot
[4:54:08] givmeafrekinname: @Mostdangspy I don't think you're familiar with WOD's launch then LUL
[4:54:09] Zomgboy: towel sing a song for us KEKW
[4:54:10] Arcahan: yyjPains
[4:54:17] MILESkg21: WOD launch would like to have a word Kappa
[4:54:21] Dreamcakee: shut the fuck up towllie thats was bad joke :D
[4:54:27] Lupusdeus: 2
[4:54:32] cabalish: 2 hours
[4:54:33] rofustv: Why are my characters on torghast realm not deleted?
[4:54:33] imjorman: Is that 11;00 PST?
[4:54:34] Horuseternal69: OGrimmer
[4:54:39] parlangua89: I don’t remember wod being bad?
[4:54:39] ShinoaKurisu: yea 2 hrs
[4:54:48] Njels95: All my cgars are stil there on Thorgast as well

[4:55:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: my job over here cutting into my ps5 time Kappa
[4:55:08] mmrghost7: tbh i dont wanna do it , less spoiling more fun on launch day
[4:55:09] Zomgboy: This reminds me of the time when ppl rushed to MOTHER to check out corruption vendor
[4:55:11] bullymikko: Do you need to download anything to participate?
[4:55:11] hgizaira: Dance
[4:55:12] kaylis_hayasei: if they wanted a real stress test they shouldve given everyone access today
[4:55:12] Thoreya: illidan is gonna be so borked on launch day smh
[4:55:14] CrimsonNurse: Will you even get through Bastion in 2 hours?
[4:55:27] Mostdangspy: @jmg1988 I am not. this will be my first new league launch. Part of the reason that made EQ launch so bad is it wasn't even a new expansion. they were just launching a classic sever
[4:55:33] ormy86: hey towelliee do you use a cloudlifter?
[4:55:45] toobaked1987: @Towelliee you are about to have all the overtime you need buddy
[4:55:47] MILESkg21: monkaS
[4:55:53] icenametv: kazzak eu pog

[4:56:19] jimmix12: is that the test now ?
[4:56:22] godcomplex33: This Xpac is so hype
[4:56:28] smegarol: @Towelliee Start with the paladin. And then you will continue with other?
[4:56:34] Aidler: hmm aparently Method now has a new 27 player raid team...
[4:56:34] toobaked1987: We will be right here waiting to enter server for 6 hours with you
[4:56:36] MILESkg21: probably down til 11
[4:56:37] jasperboy: F
[4:56:53] godcomplex33: Invite Towel! :P
[4:56:57] givmeafrekinname: @Mostdangspy doesn't matter if it's a brand new game or it's 100th expansion, a bad launch is a bad launch in the end LUL
[4:56:59] mmrghost7: like anduin is gone khadgar doesnt even give a fk

[5:39:01] givmeafrekinname: Wouldn't Malfurion know that then? He's acting like it's still her.
[5:39:10] swordwindgaming: They should rename Tyrande into Captain Moonwell because shes just a superhero now.

[5:39:25] cpain__: Anybody watch the new episode of The Mandalorian? So good
[5:39:35] SmarfTV: A running theme with WoW is that absolute power of any kind ultimately is bad for the people of Azeroth. We saw this when the light tried to posses Illidan and he rejected it
[5:39:40] xxOgre22xx: tip one back for ursoc
[5:39:50] captain_steve_rogers: Night Warrior is the Night Elf Super Sayian mode

[5:44:56] Mr_Bradford_Gaming: Nooo, bald is beautiful.
[5:45:01] Mcaffee: Preach with hair is wrong on so many levels
[5:45:02] MetallicusGaming: Basically they plant hairs from the back of your head onto your (bald spot) coz those roots are thicker on the back

[5:50:55] Lasidor: We all know that in actual launch day we’re all going to fight the login screen boss and rage at our computers lol
[5:51:07] AngryAussie365: @Towelliee in about 3 hrs and 45 mins mate, for next bag boss

[5:52:03] syphergod89: asmon has 80k plus playing demon souls last night.
[5:52:03] Lasidor: @metallicusgaming totes get it. But without the numbers it’s not really testing much. The servers will as usual be stressed to the max and struggle. We all hope it won’t but we know better after 15 years lol
[5:52:05] Denarianx: classic was 1.1M
[5:52:16] burlykomododragon: ^
[5:52:21] Ewol66: really. SL will be higher then.

[5:52:24] biscuitness: How much COD have you played?
[5:52:25] Desetra: when asmon is on nowadays it's already close to 200k
[5:52:29] TheFabilolz: I'm playing Retail now because i'm stuck on a dumb swedish server on Classic for 3 months...
[5:52:37] MetallicusGaming: Lasidor I know

[5:53:31] Ewol66: but I haven't played since WoD
[5:53:32] Weelad_x: @syphergod89 xqc wont stream wow
[5:53:34] TheFabilolz: @Ewol66 I'd rather wait 3 months and play Retail than playing on Gehennas EU :)
[5:53:46] maple_butters: @Towelliee im in and only 50 can log in
[5:53:57] DeuceDempsey: yea shroud still raids classic off stream
[5:53:58] syphergod89: wasnt he doing project 30
[5:54:07] Weelad_x: he streamed it once like for an hour
[5:54:18] Weelad_x: its just not the right content for his stream
[5:54:26] syphergod89: yeah true
[5:54:28] Ewol66: the LOS pull is him getting his practice in for SL
[5:55:00] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee can't wait to see you again on the Torghast server again

[5:56:06] Lasidor: @waldron27 no more crazy than me wanting to be Fury lol
[5:56:13] Ewol66: They kept delaying Duke Nukem and look how that turned out.
[5:56:16] Waldron27: lmao true dat.
[5:56:21] reagadin: yes but wow streamers have a much more loyal audience. if you stream with 3k today you will stream with 3k(probably more) on launch. Big variety streamers might stream with 20k but they bring viewers with them they dont pull from other streams
[5:56:24] ZabberzTV: more Time for wow then
[5:56:26] Waldron27: hes my herb and alchemy alt :P
[5:56:44] jamtlandswe: when is the launch test?
[5:56:45] biscuitness: they're a rare game that's debuting on tons of platforms simultaneously. Aren't more than a handful of those right now.
[5:56:51] TheCliffyShow: I used to solo this fight as a rogue at 70.
[5:56:52] turfjitsu: 5v5 pvp boss lol
[5:56:56] TheCliffyShow: Well, this dungeon.
[5:57:04] Weelad_x: @reagadin yeah but also anyone going into the wow section will click biggest streams which will be asmon/soda and variety streamers
[5:57:19] syphergod89: member when soda just streamed wow. i member

[5:59:15] wreckedgum: @TheFabilolz (Y) Look forward to it ! TOwellie should give you a bump
[5:59:17] reagadin: i dont think wow will ever get any additional loyal viewers because of launch viewership. wow is a very strange game for twitch. i get what you are saying but those additional viewers are not here to stay
[5:59:19] Gnerdyy: he speaks the true true.
[5:59:28] hgizaira: but those are not wow viewers anyway
[5:59:28] minipc: guild drama or what happned @MetallicusGaming
[5:59:34] biscuitness: Do you think the variety streamers can do handoffs to the channel regulars?
[5:59:45] raldrik: I hope Lux doesnt get burried watching everyone on the top of the list use his WA
[5:59:46] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee even though you do give aways just watching you is good enough for me
[6:00:01] TheCliffyShow: I don't get shit for WoW streams. So, I'm definitely screwed on launch.
[6:00:05] Savith: Yeah what is the "recommended" channels based off of, anyway
[6:00:11] Vigi9413: generous people? yeah right
[6:00:20] MetallicusGaming: minipc he just wanted to play with friends like Dcarter and Terry

[6:02:18] syphergod89: 7 ads :(
[6:02:21] SageRuskiy: @towelliee also a solid case that it’s harder to grow a WoW stream because WoW is naturally very boring to watch. So the full emphasis is on the streamers personality rather than the game
[6:02:21] Savith: No thanks CoD ad
[6:02:22] biscuitness: Small batch artisanal microphone.
[6:02:30] TheCliffyShow: Kael'thas is such a drama queen. And we have to help him in Shadowlands. Oh boy!

[6:22:40] splic3r0: @Towelliee So is the stress test supposed t ojust be org ? or will you be moving out to the quest zones?
[6:22:49] Vivelli: rip i have some food showing up at my place the same time this test is occuring
[6:23:00] Lincoln_WoW: a lot of the padlords are going venthyr right off the bat
[6:23:02] Secondbreakfasttt: my layer so damn packed
[6:23:03] MrGattz: you know, why did they not put this on the PTR where everyone can access it? if its suppose to be a launch test and only people with beta can access it then i cant imagine its going to be a very accurate simulation.
[6:23:19] Faithinlight: Pepehands from 5% to 4% and now 3% awetosDeadInside
[6:23:29] hgizaira: @MrGattz kills the hype a bit I guess
[6:23:38] schlongconnery39: @Towelliee When does DCarter get yo your place?
[6:23:40] Amarlian: @MrGattz it wouldn't surprise me if they do that sometime next week TBH

[6:23:54] MrGattz: they only got 10 days
[6:23:58] TClear: @Amarlian Exactly what I was thinking
[6:24:03] HanslMims: th luanch test open to all?
[6:24:09] pistachiomatt1: how can this even come close to mimicking the launch. so many more poeple will be logging in on launch day. players that havent even played the game in years prob
[6:24:10] chubby_ch4ser: No
[6:24:28] HanslMims: just to people with beta?
[6:24:40] turfjitsu: be a good boss @Towelliee
[6:24:42] turfjitsu: make them work
[6:24:44] sharpiejoust: thanksgiving is cancelled bro
[6:24:47] zgag: Blizzard should've sent out invites to this beta launch test. Like they did with Classic.
[6:24:48] MrTrevinoo: why doesnt Carter bring his whole family to the stream instead?
[6:24:51] Faithinlight: YEP
[6:24:55] schlongconnery39: We get the sleep cam with the puppers?
[6:24:58] griffdog125: only server i have aval is torgast

[6:25:02] TheCliffyShow: Choosing family over WoW? What's wrong with them.
[6:25:02] MrGattz: @schlongconnery39 yes
[6:25:03] hotchrisbfries: No Beta Club :(
[6:25:03] comraddoge: This probably just testing the beginning experience rather than server, cause the server will crash no matter what they do
[6:25:04] hgizaira: @pistachiomatt1 there are many servers and reals on live, this is just 1 realm. it's pretty close to actuall thing number wise
[6:25:12] CrusaderNero: yeah dont get why they dont just open up
[6:25:19] Aro725: wtf
[6:25:27] zgag: Blizzard been pretty stubborn with this beta
[6:25:29] Dankind64: @Towelliee what are we supposed to do during this test?
[6:25:31] FatChase: That's a weirdchamp if I ever saw
[6:25:42] pistachiomatt1: @Aria_Av idk i think there will be millions playing day 1. just imagine how many people who might have not played since like legion log on to play
[6:25:43] Kromede: yeah we have multi layers
[6:25:45] Clicklesly: It starts in 15 mins?
[6:25:48] Teldrin89: it's like 1/10 on alliance xd

[6:26:25] MrGattz: i mean yeah. when you have 15 million people trying to connect to one location its not gonna work properly
[6:26:27] swordart_19: still shitty servers KEKW
[6:26:30] Ewol66: the faction imbalance is real?
[6:26:33] Vigi9413: servers will be fine until everyone sits on quest givers with long bois
[6:26:35] monute316: pretty sure its a few layers i see nothing on your scrren on mine
[6:26:37] Danetje112: do /who
[6:26:38] griffdog125: there's differ layers cuz i'm here in org and prob about 200 people also but not your layer

[6:27:12] MrTrevinoo: all the poor questgivers are going to be flooded with clicks and pile ups

[6:27:16] Aro725: i cant wait lmao. If its not phased the server will light on fire
[6:27:19] hgizaira: warmode will be massacre on launch

[6:27:21] Vigi9413: rip Illidan and Stormrage
