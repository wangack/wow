[1:03:17] ubba90: @MaybeRespect its cool to have that experience in that time. but ive seen people say "multiple glad exp" in lfr and then it was like wrath cata and mop.
[1:03:43] honsou2: @ubba90 if they could play when the game was better in mop they can play now when the game is simpler and just zugzug

[1:05:02] MaybeRespect: @ubba90 I understand maybe claiming it from like TBC.
[1:05:57] tooziqx: @honsou2 the game is more complex now. I donâ€™t think youâ€™ve played in mop or cata. there was a lot of zugzug during that time. especially triple dps comps

[8:41:08] itz_killjoy: afflic having only 1 school to cast in makes them garbage, you need to be a juke god to play it
[8:41:09] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[8:41:24] Pontacos: fragile because of rogue having less defensive than other specs or does affliction play into that too?
[8:42:09] Pontacos: @itz_killjoy thatâ€™s fair - seems so odd they are even losing soul rot as nature. the curses adding dots is nice in terms of getting dmg out though
