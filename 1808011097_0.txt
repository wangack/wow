[1:12:39] crackelfat: @adgoez the only reason this game is harder is because he is playing on the HARD difficulty.  Souls games don't give you an easier option and this game is more parkour ala uncharted than any souls game.  Not really much alike at all IMO

[4:24:27] Zarke___: Whats the point of hardcore?
[4:24:29] kimohunt: if you decide to play as a group of 2-3, then you can only play when everyone of that group are online. you gotta online and go offline on the same time as a group. and if 1 people in the group die, the rest of the group members are consider dead as well.

[4:29:11] BigBjornYerthor: yeah its pretty much confirmed
[4:29:18] freefiremafia: Blizzard is just afraid that by the time the official servers are released, the hype train will pass.
[4:29:29] Brodewy_: Yeah it‚Äôs just a rumor NOTHING has been confirmed lmao who said thay
[4:29:33] EasyPeasley: @vaganminasian this is the big thing
[4:29:36] essehbee: Yesterday on WoWhead, we had datamined Hardcore strings
[4:29:38] Martinhso1: OK. It is not officially announced t hen :D
[4:29:38] tragikomik: but aslo c'mon now, do you think blizz is not going to try and capitalize to this huge influx os players? they will try, and most likely ruin whole thing in the process like usually, just my 2 cents

[4:30:11] Captainclappy: Who deals the most Damage in wow ?

[4:30:32] Ausden: Stole summits stream title
[4:30:35] lordsloths: @Captainclappy thanos
[4:30:36] freefiremafia: I don't understand where the hype really comes from. We are essentially talking about two servers. One in Europe, one in the USA.
[4:30:47] chicke___: @purplestone90 ?
[4:30:47] Magnoon73: @purplestone90 it's self imposed HC
[4:30:49] Tr1pleAYYY: did u get jedi survivor on steam?
[4:30:53] Keanuu: is shroud playing solo?

[4:31:51] ens0mniac: All these chatters commenting on the stream title  toonyPepega
[4:31:51] redmondooo: Do you think grouping should be added? Currently the duo/trio mode is kinda meh.
[4:31:54] Rezort_: where do you see his lvl with this ui
[4:31:54] Martinhso1: IF they do make official servers, I hope they follow some of the same ruleset as the addon. The leveling experience has been so much fun.
[4:31:58] Tr1pleAYYY: did u get jedi survivor on steam
[4:32:03] solidfrequency: my fav streamer

[4:32:44] tragikomik: isn't Ska playing wrath HC?
[4:32:45] zmilo20: what servers have HC ?
[4:32:54] freefiremafia: Hopefully Blizzard won't "fix" the addon. We know how they can correct brilliant ideas. Look what they ended up doing with vanilla.
[4:32:59] NoCamHd: is he playing HC on wrath servers or ?
[4:33:01] Tr1pleAYYY: did u get jedi survivor on steam?

[4:49:45] Guiza4: KEKW
[4:49:49] eastcoastcanuck: People have been griefing players by kiting higher level mobs to lower level people and getting them to get tagged. Dead. Darkshore is bad for it. Streamsnipe terror!

[5:00:20] deadvesu: Yeah but everyone can do that , thats no fun
[5:00:21] Liquidator_lol: dungeons can get rly sketchy with bad pulls
[5:00:21] yung_gab_: i have done that before
[5:00:21] drksstar: See you were doing the BORING AF way. Just quest you fight all types and levels of mobs
[5:00:26] Treir44: @TheOfficialGameChannel thats against hardcore rules

[5:00:50] shiningbr8ght: this is the mini version of Valorant
[5:00:51] TheOfficialGameChannel: gotcha i was unaware of the rules for HC. that's intense
[5:00:58] WeNeedCommss: @shroud you gonna return to new world any time soon?
[5:01:04] eastcoastcanuck: you can group with 2 or 3 people but lots of rules for it. Like you cant even be on without the others being on. Have to meet at level 1 and it cant change ever. Crzy stuff
[5:01:13] randyblackson: you have the Prototype font?
[5:01:13] Martinhso1: @TheWarox Acheivements is a good shout. They encourage you to take risks and let you show it off too.
[5:01:17] NileNirvana: is this wow classic?
[5:01:18] baudet94: mace and shield
[5:01:18] TheWarox: that'll be cool
[5:01:35] htsunday: and even if you do dungeons, they let you do deadmines at like 26 lol. like it's just 200 hours of killing things 6 levels below you
[5:01:35] KrriK: yep

[5:02:53] WeNeedCommss: 80s jesus
[5:02:56] yung_gab_: maybe on a classic+server with shaman reworked talents and skills you could tank better and maybe they would give you the firemaw tank trincket
[5:03:09] d0ntPhaZe: so is this just 1 life or what are the other rules?
[5:03:11] Locky987: Someone did warlock tanking ZG in classic

[5:11:27] deneking: what does HC stand for?
[5:11:27] Strikezilla01: There is a blue shield in Stratholme which also does damage to attacking mobs. It's not as nice as the Green Tower but it's a poorman's version.

[5:14:57] xaydrian: hows it feel being born in 94
[5:14:58] rato_de_esgoto88: official hc servers
[5:15:04] flannard: Are you close to anchorage @stmcvallin
[5:15:10] Nef414: That‚Äôs how it was, if your horde then your all horde. If your ally then your all ally.
[5:15:17] stmcvallin: no. Michigan
[5:15:19] matching_towels: And pvp battlegrounds
[5:15:25] seanders: there are some private servers that are kinda like that
[5:15:36] SordMasta: i think the official HC should allow like 1 rez per month or so. because what if you die because of a d/c or glitch or fall through world, etc?
[5:15:37] j_bar111: !hc
[5:15:43] flwerBx: this stream be so chill

[5:15:58] ltl_wackman: sordmasta if you die to glitches or griefing i thought its just appealable man

[5:16:27] daniel_tror: Which questing addon is that? Questie?
[5:16:28] TheWraith89: @SordMasta There are appeal rules at the moment. You can grief DCs, people making you die of some sort, etc.
[5:16:33] matching_towels: @sordmasta then you‚Äôd need ppl that managed to not die to be distinguished. Could be done via a special title if you‚Äôve never died
[5:16:33] SordMasta: u guys really think bliz will spend money to have people watch your video appeals? :S
[5:16:35] coffee_press: Our gear is awful.. good chance it‚Äôs better right
[5:16:47] Strikezilla01: Yeah but purples like Krol Blade or Destiny are good at 60.
[5:16:49] Liquidator_lol: its huge, hard to get good gear on hc
[5:16:50] Fugeki: Maybe adding a quest that a guild needs to do with a month cd would be cool to have a res on a character
[5:16:51] theakama: yeah nightblade specifically is meh
[5:16:57] Jimbagg: yeah if it's not an upgeade or you can't use it, it's eh
[5:17:00] SMORC30: tumtumDance tumtumDance
[5:17:02] buzz97: jokerd looted flurry axe from a mob  1 level higher than the requirement
[5:17:08] iXaviik: @SordMasta If you die, you die
[5:17:08] Martinhso1: It kinda depends on the specific item. Like Staff of Jordan is lvl 44
[5:17:10] cjshred: What should I roll hardcore chat?

[5:19:05] Django_7: @shroud whats the addon you use for your chat font
[5:19:07] Muligoon: Wouldn't mind seeing a standalone roguelike mode that is shorter but more challenging
[5:19:08] WeLoveKickDotCom: solo deadmines EZ
[5:19:10] 7ote69: why do you have to buy wow from a subscription
[5:19:17] Vemptastic: in Classic HC, the game is the leveling, not so much the endgame. It's about the journey as someone else said.
[5:19:17] Protomateria: bean LULW
[5:19:20] G1bz: @shroud I like logging on casually gaming for a few hours a night, feels like i will have something to play for a  long time
[5:19:21] Alucard_KOD: can you track play hours per character that would be stick to try to be the longest living character
[5:19:21] Nuttballl: deaths after 60 should just reset you to zero rep progression, reset all quests, and green untradable gear
[5:19:21] sticksaredrifting: KEKW BEAN
[5:19:23] Martinhso1: Its great when the game is great. Terrible when the game is terrible.

[5:19:36] WeLoveKickDotCom: monkaS contents
[5:19:37] TheRealJSlizzy: every upgrade on the way to 60 means so much more than dungeon loot at 60
[5:19:38] Alucard_KOD: can you track play hours per character that would be stick to try to be the longest living character.
[5:19:45] crowgoes: I think it needs to be faster for you average player to do hardcore

[5:20:16] Oties: Once you hit 60... do you still need to wipe your character if you die?
[5:20:19] Yamjoy: certain amounts of nodes on map and if more people farm means more nodes spawn quicker to fulfill the requirement
[5:20:19] Protomateria: @shroud do you not have the addon that lets you know when a HC character on your server dies?
[5:20:24] the_seventh_trumpet: what level is shroud
[5:20:24] CyonDru: @imcoduh it‚Äôs in the title

[5:20:44] Greyweed: @shroud If it's faster, the thrill suffers from it. Part of what makex hc engaging is the fact that it's tedious/difficult to level up I think
[5:20:45] kotti01: yes
[5:20:46] ImCoduh: @Cyonwl oop- i didnt even notice the title lol

[5:21:01] voxy_doxy: Sup shroud
[5:21:03] crowgoes: like some guy who plays 10 hours a week investing 100+ hours to die and start over doesn't really make sense
[5:21:03] Ryo_39: @Protomateria he probably has notifications off for all the low levels
[5:21:04] Oties: wow... and people are raiding aq40 while doing HC.. that's insane
[5:21:06] Civtac: if i die at 60 i would just transfer the character and play normal classic era
[5:21:10] matching_towels: I wish your level was always visible on screen for us

[5:32:00] 2melancholy: Pillagers are dangerous because they shoot through the buildings
[5:32:04] crowgoes: the harvesters in westfall are no joke
[5:32:05] Martinhso1: You go westfall as a lvl 13 and then you get ambushed by a dust devil. Good times
[5:32:05] Strikezilla01: I know the alliance leveling by memory alone. Switching to horde for Hero on Classic was certainly a challenge. Especially since I never leveled a druid before. Double trouble.
[5:32:07] Protomateria: @alienzit its called RestedXP but its costs money
