[0:25:32] BroxigarZ: @felplague Blizzard stopped making games for gamers a long time ago. They make games (like this mobile trash ripoff) for shareholders. I don’t like when shareholders dictate our genre of entertainment and if AGS didn’t exist I’d mark Blizzard as the worst triple a studio still active today.
[0:26:06] FelPlague: @BroxigarZ wait are you one of those "mobile games are not real games" people?
[0:26:19] Lintgamer: Someone is in a bad mood this morning @BroxigarZ
[0:26:25] bigcountry555: you dont speak for me im looking forward to this game and 10.0

[0:26:52] YMonsterszn: !dk
[0:27:21] BroxigarZ: I’m not saying all mobile games are no, but if your game is banned in a ton of places around the world…then you have to take a realistic look at what kind of evil trash it is and who it’s actually made for.
[0:27:51] FelPlague: @BroxigarZ I do also gotta ask, what about diablo 4, about overwatch 2, about diablo 2 remastered, about dragonflight are "Games fro the shareholders and not for the actual gamers"

[0:29:22] Lintgamer: Wait is it really banned in some countries? @FelPlague
[0:29:33] bigcountry555: games banned in other countries are banned because their gov control peoples lives
[0:29:40] akia03: yep belgium and nl cant pre register
[0:29:57] FelPlague: @Lintgamer which, pokemon or warcraft rubmle? Warcraft rumble is banned in some places because it has "random item lootboxes" which some countries have outlawed
[0:30:02] BroxigarZ: We know nothing about Diablo 4s monetization yet, Overwatch is still laced with loot boxes and we don’t know the box cost of the real OW2 PvE content, Diablo 2 Remastered and Classic WoW were community outcry’s due to blizzard shareholder takedowns of private servers (anti consumer) and don’t get me started on dragon flight
[0:30:15] Lintgamer: Wait I live in Belgium. What game ant I pre register? @akia03
[0:30:47] harris243124: God will punish all one day for wasting our lives playing world of Warcraft
[0:31:27] FelPlague: @BroxigarZ we literally know exactly how diablo 4 monetization will work. you buy it once and then you own it forever, same as d1/2/3. overwatch 2 will likely cost max 60$, likely less. and oh look blizz does not make games for gamers, and when they do they only do so cause they have to. Also taking down private servers is not anti-consumer, its against the law my dude
[0:31:29] Lintgamer: I wonder if Warcraft Rumble will be banned in Belgium due to the lootboxes?
[0:31:50] bigcountry555: i guess we will just have to fight said god in the next expac raid
[0:32:03] BroxigarZ: @lintgamer it is
[0:32:15] akia03: @Lintgamer i couldnt pre register pn belgium or dutch phones
[0:32:17] Lintgamer: @BroxigarZ link?
[0:32:21] BroxigarZ: @felplague you are talking out of your butt
[0:32:34] CodyDaBrodie: Ayyy chat. Just started playing 9.2, what’s a good iLvl to start doing 15’s efficiently?
[0:32:49] Lintgamer: @Lintgamer I pre registered yesterday in belgium?
[0:32:59] FelPlague: @BroxigarZ lol I AM talking out of my butt? dude you just said blizzard shutting down illegal servers is "anti-consumer"
[0:33:06] gelimarr: pre registered in Belgium too

[0:33:55] Lintgamer: Clash Royal has also boxes that you can buy with money and that game is not banned in Belgium so why would this game be banned>
[0:34:30] harris243124: Is this soundtrack on Toweliees YouTube?
[0:34:47] FelPlague: @harris243124 pretty sure this is just official wowm usic
[0:35:15] harris243124: I know but like all the songs mashed did he create it? Or is it on his youtube
[0:35:37] Lintgamer: Think its a playlist on youtube
[0:35:40] BroxigarZ: @felplague you don’t know anything about law if you think private servers are illegal.
[0:36:15] FelPlague: @BroxigarZ chicag62LOL chicag62LOL chicag62LOL
[0:36:29] Necrothunder: @BroxigarZ they are strictly against blizzards EULA, therefore illegal
[0:36:51] FelPlague: @Necrothunder not even the EULA ,they are against copyright law, which blizzard MUST enforce or risk losing their copyright
[0:37:21] FelPlague: nevermind the fact blizzard has sued multiple private servers in the past in court and succeeded.
[0:37:29] Necrothunder: @FelPlague that too
[0:37:31] Its_Immanis: guys, stop letting facts get in the way of a truly epic "for-profit company making profits is bad, mmmkay?" rant
[0:37:38] willy_billy_silly: will he ever get another intro or make one because I miss that WoW
[0:37:41] willy_billy_silly: one
[0:38:49] BroxigarZ: No what blizzard has done is sent cease and desist orders, and private server owners choose not to get into expensive legal battles with a multibillion dollar company over IP theft if they are or are not monetizing it.

[0:45:52] Sphinx2k: but with warcraft IP
[0:46:00] FelPlague: in this day and age, there is literally no original game concepts, everything is a copy of something else
[0:46:00] tweakeds: blizzard's skill is taking other games and doing them better. sry not sry
[0:46:15] BroxigarZ: Looked at Blizzard vs Reeves and maybe you should read it…he emulated direct client code and was backdooring while accepting profits for doing so. That’s quite a bit different than some other private servers out there that simply get cease and desist letters.
[0:46:23] FelPlague: i still remember ff14 fans seeing the dragonflight cinematic and claiming wow stole "The Sundering" from ff14 which happened in 2014
[0:46:48] Sphinx2k: they had all the cash store upgrades for the demo...
[0:46:49] parallax1983: @broxigarz  are you really still on this subject?
[0:47:03] Innersane: Well I been enjoying that Lost Ark lately

[0:47:35] StoicTaurus: Blizzard at it's best was when evolving proven ideas.. since ever wow tried new things failture rate went up.
[0:47:36] FelPlague: @BroxigarZ speaking it was a girl not a guy, i already know you didnt fully read it.

[0:51:48] FelPlague: its a tug of war style game that is super common and popular in starcraft/warcraft custom game modes

[1:09:45] Eregbueye: The artstyle

[1:17:55] MBG_95: sandworm relics not being account wide currency is stupid

[1:24:08] Frank4LuLz: you get a commadatio token, and it unlocks the quatermaster, like MOP
[1:24:13] Im_a_sad_man: Because that saves time LUL
[1:24:20] icedoutxrobmahhoe: heyyo
[1:24:56] kyshen3: 9.2 has casualized the game enough though i mean ...they continue to do that that means less replayability the game has also.
[1:25:20] annokev: First toon to exalted unlocks it for all toons, sounds good
[1:25:20] Zachoowi: heyo Uwu xD
[1:25:25] reklesnes: yea id enjoy that alot more the grind would feel way more worth it and making it alot more alt friendly
[1:25:46] Jarlan23: whats the point of exalted i thought you only needed revered
[1:25:50] Melonbrew: I am doing it on two characters, Warrior and hunter
[1:25:51] Otton_03: So never Kappa
[1:25:53] Jarlan23: for the lego
[1:26:00] KumaEnjoyer: the 50k augment rune
[1:26:01] Jarlan23: oh yea
[1:26:03] kyshen3: Maybe something like if you reach exalted you can get a 100% increased rep buff for your alts?
[1:26:06] KumaEnjoyer: saves so much money
[1:26:16] Jarlan23: i got an army of alts doing mission tables for runes
[1:26:29] FatalSmite: It’s huge for m+ too
[1:26:39] saberix: just remove the runes
[1:26:41] board4life65: and your using it in season 4 too
[1:26:56] infinitrus: yeah rep needs to be account wide i am not farming all the rep on all my alts its painful
[1:27:54] funKShun: Asmongold shared your video on stream yesterday
[1:28:03] saberix: the mobile game looks so fucking awful :C resources should go to other things
[1:28:07] Cheatztvz: what is happening gear wise in 9.2.5 that makes u able to get free 272 ilvl gear
[1:28:24] CameronParadox: I’m not hyped tbh

[1:29:43] funKShun: You have to be delusional to think wow will come to phones LUL
[1:29:49] casualfury: LUL
[1:29:50] Zachoowi: Polish a turd, its still a turd
[1:29:58] Frank4LuLz: as a old boomer, i actually like it, i can wait for a moba or a mmo on my phone, its coming
[1:30:00] casualfury: true
[1:30:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: The mobile market is pretty big, it's smart to get into it with something from the WoW universe
[1:30:12] Tauren0309: Will you stream the Testing?
[1:30:14] klocky: I think it looks kinda cool to be fair
[1:30:17] pereadin: Wassup wassup
[1:30:20] WoW_StandalonE: its childish
[1:30:23] infinitrus: look if u think its shit its not for u. i think alot of people will like it
[1:30:25] casualfury: Its a quick cash grab game
[1:30:25] Frank4LuLz: they dont like the cartoonie ness about it i bet
[1:30:35] funKShun: I liked the chars
[1:30:37] pereadin: LOL YEAH DUDE
[1:30:38] Yagr6: it seems tailored to kids imo
[1:30:38] nephttv_: whats a sleep schedule @Towelliee
[1:30:41] CameronParadox: GearsPop was fun I loved it and it failed.
[1:30:42] pereadin: Messed up bad
[1:30:45] squidbubblez: dude im so gonna play it haha everyone mad fuck that im a gamer
[1:30:47] MBG_95: 2 big questions. are you a fan of Warcraft and do you play any mobile games currently
[1:30:57] casualfury: they are gonna sell gems LUL
[1:30:57] plankdemi: it looks good for a mobile game
[1:31:01] Frank4LuLz: they all sound like parrots, saying the same stuff all over
[1:31:02] chrslp: The target audience of mobile games is generally kids and adults on the toilet imo
[1:31:09] plankdemi: key word is mobile
[1:31:12] pereadin: yeah take your time
[1:31:15] pereadin: i'm just chillin'
[1:31:32] FranticAlba: It looks like what you'd expect from a mobile game, I think people were expecting too much
[1:31:36] infinitrus: i was hopeing for a raid shadowlegends wow style
[1:31:48] kyshen3: So that's where TOm Chilton has been??? Seems like a waste of his talents....
[1:31:57] infinitrus: but i think this tower deffence game will be fun
[1:31:58] casualfury: It doesn't matter it looks pretty they are gonna play it
[1:32:00] Jibbs280: their just mad they made a moibile game
[1:32:02] funKShun: people like to spew shit LUL
[1:32:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's not my kind of game, but it looked alright to me
[1:32:08] MBG_95: it legit could be a way for people to get into WoW too
[1:32:11] icedoutxrobmahhoe: any new games ya looking forward to?
[1:32:16] Yagr6: if its tailored to kids then why would they make it to begin with? we are in our 30s most of us
[1:32:23] GolferTV: shit is shit is a valid answer
[1:32:23] kyshen3: Like i finally saw Tom Chilton i forgot he wasn't even there!
[1:32:24] xsp00n: It's Shit becuase midnight chat is dumb af
[1:32:27] Vaedrun: I just like the game for what it is. Gonna love playing it while in the train off to work.
[1:32:29] DrakeDuude: i didn't like how zoomed in it is. id like it more zoomed out
[1:32:30] board4life65: wish we can play the game or see more gameplay
[1:32:34] kyshen3: GOD BLESS
[1:32:39] Eregbueye: Sometimes people just can't describe why they feel a certain they, it doesn't discard the feeling tho
[1:32:45] Im_a_sad_man: Hopefully it wont end up like hearthstone mercenaries LUL
[1:32:47] funKShun: zoom thing is valid
[1:32:54] chrslp: @JagrZero Because its just a plain fact that the main downloaders of games on app stores are 18 and younger
[1:32:56] mikejames01: I wont call it bad till I try it out
[1:33:04] chrslp: Kids have more free time
[1:33:07] reklesnes: i cant comment on it as i dont play phone games im phones its strictly for porn and work calls
[1:33:09] annokev: I wont play it personally but I am hoping it does really well. More eyes on the Warcraft franchise is good for WoW. Might get some spill over to WoW.
[1:33:10] WayneG947: He is wired to think its shit because its modern Blizzard, just Blizz haters. I just like being meh about everyrhing, a lot less stressful
[1:33:12] MBG_95: was this a combination of blizzard + King or was it just Blizz?
[1:33:23] casualfury: They are gonna ask real money for the heroes thats why its a quick cash grab game if you want examples just look at every freemium game
[1:33:34] The_Mail_Man__: knolls trolls and kobolds is a bar
[1:33:34] kyshen3: You're not forced to play the game ... like we have diablo immortal coming if you want mature.
[1:33:36] Zettabyte: Hogger raid KEKW
[1:33:41] Frank4LuLz: Blizz gave us a Game Boy, be happy zoomers

[1:33:43] Jibbs280: it is a bit odd its tailored to kids but its based off a 15 year old game where a kid wouldnt know a single charecter
[1:33:48] Innersane: ROFL Towelliee
[1:33:52] kyshen3: All im saying is... im ready to see Dragonflight alpha.
[1:33:55] funKShun: we all know that
[1:34:03] casualfury: LUL
[1:34:07] Zachoowi: Oh so because everyone does it, makes it fine?
[1:34:10] Innersane: The game is shit because shittyshitshit IMAO
[1:34:11] mikejames01: I Am 51 and love wow lore and will try it before I say its crap or good
[1:34:14] funKShun: thanks cpt. obvious LUL
[1:34:16] D3m0nHunt3r666: My only complain its that instead of just focusing on Warcraft they could have made it for all the franchises like HoTS. Because the "races" seem a bit off
[1:34:21] WayneG947: there are alternative ways to earn the money to buy the heroes
[1:34:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Free to play model games always have microtransactions
[1:34:31] chrslp: I wouldnt say its tailored just for kids. They have a balance of old wow nostalgia and appealing to the largest audience in app stores (kids)
[1:34:35] casualfury: no issue man game is great my bad
[1:34:40] EVILBombermann: Some times I feel people don't know what a cash grab game is xD
[1:34:48] Zettabyte: Store mounts Kappa
[1:34:50] dyslexican1: So long as those things are cosmetic, who cares. Wow currently isnt "pay to win" dispite what people say
[1:35:14] Khalostaran: hi
[1:35:25] WoW_StandalonE: @Towelliee but you are talking to WOW community right now, not to the mobile game community, that's why people don't like it here
[1:35:34] funKShun: I can pay people to carry me in arena, so I would argue about pay2 win LUL
[1:35:36] CameronParadox: Making gold playing the game but at what cost
[1:35:50] Vladeimir: no "surprise mechanic"?
[1:35:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Loot boxes, gacha, those are the cash grab
[1:36:10] plankdemi: wow players wanted wow pet battle app and since they didnt get it they are mad
[1:36:17] WayneG947: @cameronparadox *in Guldan voice* Everythinnngggg
[1:36:38] chrslp: LOL
[1:36:43] chrslp: almost bad
[1:36:44] Zachoowi: Will there be lootboxes? Or packs with random cards? same thing
[1:36:46] Jibbs280: nah u make more than enough gold and dust in hearthstone
[1:36:53] EVILBombermann: gachas are cash traps
[1:36:57] hothandzztcg: its a game about wow to play when u cannot play wow . wow sounds nice to me
[1:37:12] Im_a_sad_man: Hearthstone already has a gacha mode which died on release mercenaries LUL
[1:37:31] CameronParadox: It’s shit people are still gonna play it and it’s gonna be successful
[1:37:47] Frank4LuLz: nooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[1:37:52] Frank4LuLz: dont do it
[1:38:08] chrslp: If we're being completely honest I dont think the game looks bad but the announcement was a bit cringe. They were trying way to much to appeal to a younger audience when the main audience watching was current wow players
[1:38:09] CameronParadox: Ppl just bitch but in the end blizz wins
[1:38:17] Vaedrun: It's that time again my EU friends... Opening the weekly vault..

[1:38:44] mikejames01: yet the same peeps said hearthstone would die fast JOKES on them lol
[1:38:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Best of luck with the vault, EU!!
[1:38:49] MBG_95: isn't Clash royale still popular?
[1:38:58] FranticAlba: Mobile gaming is the future as much as people don't want to admit it, most people just have phones whereas console and PC gaming specifically need an additional purchase for hardware.
[1:38:59] idenkaz_: they had fun so who cares

[1:40:00] xsp00n: mobile gaming is PART of the future, but its not the future
[1:40:07] funKShun: let the boomers pay for our PC content, why be mad
[1:40:19] mikejames01: this game will do well and not die
[1:40:22] Balcones: dont tell me youre not gonna play it while you take a dump XD
[1:40:25] masterlee05: oh diablo immortal will gonna be so good
[1:40:35] Frank4LuLz: shit...i might buy a better phone now to game at work now
[1:40:40] CameronParadox: I’m excited
[1:40:40] Melonbrew: I am looking forward to Diablo Immortal. First mobile game I think I might spend alot of time on
[1:40:41] Jarwerewolf: lol
[1:40:50] hothandzztcg: mobile gamers arent like normal gamers they dont even consider it gaming when they the ones falling for those dumb ass deals that say 1 time only but are up every day lol
[1:40:50] CameronParadox: Because it’s still a Diablo game
[1:40:52] mikejames01: Lot of wow players out of touch
[1:40:58] Krazed59: Immortal is going to be on PC too now
[1:41:08] WayneG947: @funkshun Exactly, let them go broke buying pixels and we will play the good games that are made with their money
[1:41:09] masterlee05: its not about that but we expected a better quality game for the mobile.. like order and chaos type of game
[1:41:11] The_Mail_Man__: doin a key now tow?
[1:41:12] Rudric_Ice: i think immortal will print more $$ than arclight what do you think ?
[1:41:17] CameronParadox: Yes I forgot @krazed59
[1:41:22] xsp00n: @Towelliee people want what the cant have, and then they get it and they dont want it
[1:41:25] swordart2022: @mikejames01 should nto call people on social media /not in game wow players xD
[1:41:25] CrusaderNero: eh well its fine to think games today are shite  compared to how it was. Are you supposed to be forced to like mobile games? LUL
[1:41:28] Zachoowi: But im cosy in my house :(
[1:41:36] Frank4LuLz: some wow players need to get girlfriends and leave the caves and attics
[1:41:43] SnoWeazel: Would love to see the game as a minigame inside wow
[1:41:54] swordart2022: @SnoWeazel ++++++++ would be cool
[1:41:56] FranticAlba: Since Arclight is a game within the warcraft universe itself, imagine if we could play Arclight within WoW by going into a tavern and our WoW character is playing it.
[1:41:59] reklesnes: is mobile gaming realy gaming tho or is it just wiggling your thuumbs
[1:42:01] A_Klimas: yeah that art looked kinda temp
[1:42:08] A_Klimas: polish happens in passes
[1:42:13] swordart2022: @SirScottyP that would be big Pog and Hearthstone too
[1:42:21] FranticAlba: Yea hearthstone too
[1:42:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoWhead is saying noplans for PC for it
[1:42:40] MBG_95: hearthstone worked cause it is landscape too
[1:42:48] mikejames01: I wanted a Pokémon wow phone game lol
[1:42:56] chrslp: It would look weird on PC. Its not played horizontally so thered be so much dead space
[1:43:07] masterlee05: @Frank4LuLz i met my wife 7 years ago in wow LUL since then we bought a house, we have 7 cats and 1 dog! we are still playing the game so what are you talking about LUL
[1:43:08] A_Klimas: we had to mark specific things in OW to only show on pc vs switch/xbone
[1:43:12] chrslp: I think they 100% made hearthstone with the idea of a future mobile release
[1:43:18] Jarlan23: 4k on my server
[1:43:19] WayneG947: @mikejames01 That project was cancelled unfortunately
[1:43:22] A_Klimas: because pc's got more juice
[1:43:30] Frank4LuLz: Pokeman Wow game might get wow nerds girlfriends, get them out of the houses (caves and Attic)
[1:43:43] chrslp: Hearthstone was ready for mobile really at release. All drag and drop mechanics
[1:43:52] FranticAlba: The game looked fine imo
[1:43:52] jaysteea: it is like clash royale it is gonna print money the way clash did it and if it has kind of competetive scene it is going to be even more money
[1:43:56] CrusaderNero: im leveling a warlock in classic bc and im happy. dont need more LUL
[1:44:23] Zettabyte: World to World's First, @Towelliee? ;D
[1:44:25] CrusaderNero: my son will for SURE play the wow mobile game LUL
[1:44:29] Krazed59: Mobile to PC seems like an easier fix than the other way around.  But I don't understand why you would limit your market on mobile only if you can pull PC adaptation off.
[1:44:35] chrslp: I just dont like games on my phone because my goddamn $1000 iPhone turns into an oven after like 10 minutes
[1:44:38] SnoWeazel: @swordart2022, i know right!! And to be able to play hearthstone inside the ins would be next level
[1:44:44] jaysteea: so i guuess we can see the echo vs liquid finals
[1:44:53] CameronParadox: I’m excited for Diablo immortal
[1:44:55] masterlee05: i play mobile games like cod mobile, wild rift etc so i assumed that blizzard will make something on par with those games and graphics... anyway it is what it is
[1:45:14] Otton_03: There was no limit of games per day or anything ?
[1:45:24] A_Klimas: people also forget its a mobile game, its meant to look good on a small screen. readability is super important since the screen space is so limited
[1:45:31] CrusaderNero: @masterlee05 Blizzard art style has never really been "realistic" though

[2:39:07] Yagr6: i have faith in them for launch , the only bad one i remember was wod
[2:39:07] swordart2022: They should buff COsmic flux from m+ , give it from callings too.
[2:39:50] iammrknowitall: Yeah Dragonflight is gonna be 2023 and not expecting Overwatch 2 pve release until 23 either

[2:41:51] swordart2022: @Jarlan23 WutFace do not think so
[2:42:00] pavepawns: so question in regards to Arclight. since you tried it out already. is there anything that you personally thought was missing or might need a bit of work?
[2:42:12] fred_birkhoff: im calling it right now, i don't think they'll release cataclysm again too
[2:42:21] Metket: if they make same mistakes like 35 servers at launch it will die pretty fast soon
[2:42:26] Amalgamut: Not disputing Classic’s appeal, but it’s not like nerds are sitting at home marking their calendars for wrath like they would an expansion.
[2:43:35] swordart2022: @Amalgamut just because you dont do it does nto mean others do same.
[2:44:44] pavepawns: @Amalgamut there sadly are ppl that are doing that
[2:44:53] pavepawns: and i know one
[2:47:23] Amalgamut: @pavepawns What part didn’t you understand about me not disputing it? I’m just saying the hype for an expansion over the dud that was Shadowlands is probably higher than the nostalgia for Classic. Blizzard needs to slam us this year and I think they will.
[2:48:56] swordart2022: If there will be mount i hope not in Retail/ put it on store for 25.
[2:49:03] swordart2022: Classic mount cost like 60 ....
[2:49:04] Frank4LuLz: pEOPLE DONT WANT bLIZZ TO PROFIT?
[2:49:12] pavepawns: no i meant the calendar shit
[2:49:45] Gizimoo86: i wonder what they do with current TBC servers for Wotlk, do they keep current setup or merge them i mean most of them dead or 90 % unbalanced
[2:50:04] Amalgamut: I’m all for it. BC digital deluxe thing with mounts was awesome. Wish they would do physical editions though like the did for OG Classic release

[3:25:56] swordart2022: @theHereticDK Different people do different things and have different responsibilities.
[3:26:02] SpenceSir: are there any hints on release date window?
[3:26:10] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad

[3:26:33] SpenceSir: @swordart2022 cool
[3:26:43] swordart2022: SO Dragonflight is apparently larget than NOrthrend so when i look at map it will be HUGE.
[3:26:55] Coriollis: I'll try to take a guess about wc3 reforged, it was outsourced to the best of my knowledge so the code is from another company which holds the rights for it  aaand mobile looks better
[3:27:03] Sylphy_TV: refor...funded towCry
[3:27:04] NotTakenJack: !yt
[3:27:04] Metket: @Towelliee would you wear vigilant guardian shield on your prot pala? since its not giving stats i'm debating using it.

[3:27:12] Fylerian: whats your vape mod sir?
[3:27:17] theheretic_: @Towelliee i understand, however it's the same ocmpany and it's really bad leaving behind such a iconic game in that state
[3:27:36] Frank4LuLz: THA ONE GUY THAT IS IN THE BASEMENT AT iRVINE, HE WORKS REFORGE
[3:27:47] SpenceSir: Towelliee I want you to know the "Socal killer" has been on my mind since yesterday. Thank you for the emotional damage
[3:27:56] D3m0nHunt3r666: there is an article about what happened
[3:28:02] swordart2022: Idk people should play it before talking much about it :P
[3:28:14] ThePawPaw: its because they believe one time in blizzard and they failed so...yeah
[3:28:18] MetaKuron: I mean people did spend their money on it
[3:28:20] theheretic_: @Towelliee it is, im happy for a fun warcraft mobile game, it's just sad the wc3 situation
[3:28:41] D3m0nHunt3r666: towF towF towF
[3:28:44] swordart2022: Seen Soda play some custom games looked good and played fine idk what everyone else talks about .
[3:28:55] Coriollis: like Starcraft Broodwar was remastered by Blizzard team and it shows, WC3 Reforged was outsourced to a Malaysian team I think , Lemon - something and it shows
[3:29:12] SpenceSir: Hey the more games that come out is good imo, i'll check it out and if I like it I'll play it. simples
[3:29:25] swordart2022: true
[3:29:59] dldrzoidberg: android ios developers codders etc
[3:30:12] dldrzoidberg: different experience
[3:30:26] ashwing_: Ive read a looot of negativity towards this mobile announcement without even touching the game...
[3:30:54] swordart2022: @ashwing_ should avoid such people then
[3:31:20] theheretic_: @Towelliee I understand and agree with your point. I just think it's important to talk about wc3 every now and then

[3:31:39] Coriollis: if candy crush can print don't worry this will print too
[3:31:42] whteverthefk: !yt
[3:31:53] Mcsuiy: tbh, everyone will try it. regardless if they admit it or not :D
[3:32:03] dldrzoidberg: dragonflight is for wow people. this is for other type of peopke
[3:32:07] swordart2022: +
[3:32:16] SpenceSir: isn't candy crush carrying the CoD losses? I read that somewhere
[3:32:19] MetaKuron: I won't! (from Belgium...)
[3:32:26] Balkep: people are simply struggling to grasp the new reality of gaming
[3:32:32] Hawke_89: I wonder if they have plans to let us play it through WoW itself
[3:32:35] dldrzoidberg: i will try if they have a reward like a mount pet
[3:32:40] Hawke_89: that would be kind of cool
[3:33:07] Sylphy_TV: Tom: look at all this content your getting, and you want more?! Towelliee: yes. LUL
[3:33:27] Sylphy_TV: More!
[3:33:34] theheretic_: @Towelliee true, i wish the best for blizzard, been here for about 20 years
[3:33:39] swordart2022: SAY IT LIKE A GIGACHAD in chat
[3:33:43] pereadin: ohhh who was it
[3:33:53] Sylphy_TV: nice
[3:33:53] Molehj: KEKW
[3:34:28] v3xZERO: what are the addons for the healthbars and unit frames?
[3:34:51] NBK_Sethus: mobile dev is different but simpler
[3:34:53] swordart2022: plater and unitframes elvui i think
[3:35:19] Balkep: they are different, but mostly for things like controls, UI, battery concerns, length of play sessions, etc - engines are very multiplatform nowadays
[3:35:25] dldrzoidberg: blizz is a gaming company. mobile gaming is a thing, they wanna have a slice of it
[3:35:32] Hawke_89: Did you feel that the accouncement video and the whole Blooper-ish/goofy style was Microsoft influence and direction? or its tottally blizzard ? coz that seemed off @Towelliee
[3:36:03] mikejames01: Microsoft has no say in any of this till next year
[3:36:03] Coriollis: @Zethuz uhh you'd be surprised with compability through android versions and OS specific mobile platforms xD
[3:36:05] RealMelorandor: They shouldn't just leave Warcraft Reforged out to dry.
[3:36:11] ashwing_: Microsoft LUL
[3:36:34] Colt_Engineer: yes
[3:36:38] BalamberV: y
[3:36:38] sgtalash: no
[3:36:40] swordart2022: Yes
[3:36:42] mySire: yes
[3:36:43] maalow: Yes
[3:36:45] D3m0nHunt3r666: yew
[3:36:47] Coriollis: no I dont think so
[3:36:47] KaisenSiru: Yes.
[3:36:59] Mcsuiy: yes
[3:36:59] KaisenSiru: You can. Did it a few weeks ago.
[3:37:00] D3m0nHunt3r666: but can't upgrade it
[3:37:05] mikejames01: AND Microsoft lets them do what they want they even said they wont interfere in the game stuff
[3:37:06] theheretic_: I'm talking about priorities, not making the mobile team work on WC3, I'm talking about not going into new project while they leave other games dying (WC3, Hots, Starcraft 2)
[3:37:09] Coriollis: 262 but cant up
[3:37:30] thenekkid: blizzard has always been goofy
[3:37:34] MetaKuron: There was no singing :(
[3:37:36] Balkep: the video is aimed at specific audience, hence the style
[3:37:38] MrGattz: you cant turn cypher gear into tier if thats what you got from a random chest or something. i didnt see
[3:37:46] Coriollis: the last HS cinematic was realy good, but the trailer was so cringe that I liked in the end xD
[3:37:49] KaisenSiru: Yeah the presentation was good. The viewers are the cringe ones.
[3:37:53] Chaosruler: This is blizz's style tho, all of their games have the cartoony style
[3:37:58] RealMelorandor: I get that Warcraft Reforged isn't making anymore money, it really isn't right to the fans that were hyped for it and put money out to buy it. I
[3:37:59] maalow: it's loot from antros
[3:37:59] BalamberV: you can make tier with it
[3:38:00] MrGattz: oh then it should be fine to upgrade
[3:38:09] Molehj: WoW was critised for being too cartoony when it released..
[3:38:26] bonkyouded: if it drops from the raid boss you can turn it into tier
[3:38:31] RealMelorandor: Warcraft 3 was pretty cartoony as was Warcraft 2 and 1 fucking idiots
[3:38:39] Amalgamut: You guys musta missed the Overwatch trailer back in 2015 then if you think Arclight is goofy
[3:38:41] theheretic_: @realMelorandor exactly, and its a classic blizzard game, i feel they just spat on the old school players.
[3:38:43] Colt_Engineer: I hate being right all the time
[3:38:48] ZEEnitrofx: they are Targeting HearthStone crowd not HARDcore Retail players
[3:39:00] D3m0nHunt3r666: @thehereticdk unlike WC3 , Hots and SC2 will not receive any more updates. WC3 is currently non-existent
[3:39:35] theheretic_: @D3m0nHunt3r666 true..
[3:39:41] swordart2022: disagree
[3:39:49] swordart2022: Game is for everyone who has phone 4Head does not take rocket science,
[3:39:53] RealMelorandor: @Colt_Engineer Same
[3:39:53] Molehj: Towel was pleased with that maneuver
[3:40:03] swordart2022: Game is for kids etc
[3:40:03] Coriollis: I'm curious how raids will look
[3:40:05] Zettabyte: towOny
[3:40:13] primej_24: i wonder how customizable the ui is gonna be for next expac
[3:40:14] mikejames01: Hearthstone is a different lore set

[3:40:41] RealMelorandor: I mean Hearthstone is targeted towards WoW crowd too in that case which isn't bad thing
[3:40:48] swordart2022: Game can bring new people to Blizz for all other games so .
[3:40:51] MetaKuron: Is it very PVP focused?
[3:41:04] D3m0nHunt3r666: probably 2 vs 1

[3:46:39] Angratar: this is really low damage on this boss)
[3:46:40] Coriollis: yeah but HS and OW lost their creative public face and it shows where WoW despite issues over the years had more stable public face so people can relate more and has better engagement
[3:46:47] maalow: start of the week LFRs are a breeze
[3:46:55] maalow: end of the week is a nightmare

[3:47:15] StraightErro: If WoW Mobile has guilds, will there be a race to world first? To see who can drop a grand or more into the game the fastest to beat the timed content?
[3:47:50] swordart2022: @Zelrise no
[3:47:52] MrGattz: its not wow
[3:47:56] MrGattz: its warcraft
[3:48:09] Molehj: @MrGattz thank you, that was killing me LUL

[3:52:19] swordart2022: PEOPLE just assume it mindlessly KEKW
[3:52:30] Colt_Engineer: LAHEEEE
[3:52:31] shanks_blank: but it says there will be purchases with random items ?
[3:52:42] BalamberV: @Towelliee , do you have any information of Diablo/Starcraft in WoW graphics in future? If they would bring such an opportunity which one would be the best? Diablo/Starcraft or WoW
[3:52:44] Gargantix: people seem to think "random rewards" means loot boxes.
[3:52:53] swordart2022: @shanks_blank where ?
[3:53:01] cinamonjackz: Can you not pre register on the apple app store? It only lets me do it on the google store @Towelliee
[3:53:05] swordart2022: @BalamberV I think there is piixel version for starcraft
[3:53:09] shanks_blank: @swordart2022 on the google play page
[3:53:18] ScurvyHyam: So just portrait mode?

[3:57:14] Gargantix: whay difficulty is this raid on?
[3:57:18] Clockwerk_Industries: got a venthyr enh shammy
[3:57:25] bukka_hot: but too much expansions and cards to try and catch up for pvp as f2p
[3:57:25] swordart2022: @Colt_Engineer SUSSY
[3:57:41] not_pr0: tbh mercanaries was mostly the pve and noone plays it
[3:57:45] not_pr0: bgs are pvp
[3:57:45] Belasard: i think a mayor factor on mobile for pve is the option to pause the game, when you need to. you will never be able to pause for some longer periods against humans
[3:57:50] not_pr0: and helped a lot
[3:58:17] Coriollis: @not_pr0 you need more features for that and a public face that can engage the playerbase
[3:58:17] Clockwerk_Industries: yeah im tryin to figure out this whole gear upgrade system, ill have to read some more on wowhead
[3:58:19] bukka_hot: @not_pr0  I tried it for a bit but it seem there no gold / cards rewards so imo no reason to play it
[3:58:36] not_pr0: yeah mercs was garbage tbh
[3:59:06] Clockwerk_Industries: talking about wow, the cosmic flux you just mentioned

[4:00:40] Coriollis: if all works well I can see something like amiibo
[4:00:49] Clockwerk_Industries: basically just started with the maldraxxus dailies, I think theres a dude in oribos ready to send me to ZM also. just trying to figure out the best route to boost my ilvl right now
[4:00:50] Amalgamut: I reckon if Arclight has legs and when BlizzCon happens next year, those minis will be the hot item at the con!
[4:01:13] cinamonjackz: the mini's look like the old mega bloks! wish they never discontinued those even though they werent a big seller!

[4:03:42] tetrahydridodinitrogen: towelliee secret 40k fan confirmed

[4:06:03] Bigmann109: that druid name though
[4:06:27] Amalgamut: All they need to do is hook up with Cute But Deadly with the minis for those blind packs that they sell on the store and at BlizzCon eventually etc.

[4:11:04] Amalgamut: It’s a game within a game. Blizz loves the meta
[4:11:31] cinamonjackz: I mean obviously @swordart2022, but why did they choose him over bigger heroes of the ally like Uther/ Varian/ etc.

[4:51:35] Jarlan23: this is what the reddit post says. Blizzard implemented a bugfix today for Vengeance: Fixed a bug that allowed Demonic (Talent) to extend Metamorphosis to excessive duration. This hotfix accidentally broke havoc, as of right now the first eyebeam after using meta will instead reduce the duration of the active meta, and eyebeam casts after the first one will not extend meta duration either.
[4:51:57] ThatGuyFayde: @Towelliee you using survival of the fittest for the 33 sec bark?

[5:58:38] eloburglar: Probably not bcuz of the dots
[5:58:56] ToastedTwinki: @swordart2022 listen. @towelliee has been in this game longer then you’ve been alive

[6:02:26] ikoopa: Is there a reason my commercial was in korean lol
[6:02:35] MOLAR305: my biggest gripe with M+ is that pugging will drive you to drink if you dont have a guild to run with
[6:03:04] swordart2022: "Really looking forward to showing you guys what we had the opportunity to check out with the game devs and art crew this past week. Be sure to check out  @BajheeraWoW  during his gaming stream and we'll take a look more into  @WarcraftRumble . 😻"
[6:03:23] swordart2022: from warcraftjen all i know
[6:04:24] CanHasGaming: I pugged to over 2700 last season and the real only gripe is just how long between dungeons most of the time
[6:05:18] PsykosysGG: towelliee you gonna do some sort of event for immortal?
[6:05:20] MOLAR305: @CanHasGaming were you a healer or tank or dps?

[6:08:24] hawee11: @towelliee is the mobile game, a credit card swiping game?
[6:08:46] Sylphy_TV: yaiks dawg
[6:08:49] swordart2022: @hawee11 do not think it will take cash
[6:08:55] funKShun: do it LUL

[6:09:10] neorang3r: if world of warcraft was VR, will @Towelliee live in it?
[6:09:11] Wcvechten: getting demonetized in 1 video challenge that way
[6:09:27] funKShun: ppl are so clueless
[6:09:28] Yagr6: nah what he means is instead of puting time and resource into arclite make warcraft 4

[6:09:38] Colt_Engineer: do you feel like WoW players have always have had this negative outlook or is there like a defining moment when the community changed?
[6:09:50] CanHasGaming: 82 I think?
[6:09:56] RuggedRender: I mean... I wouldnt mind a fun warcraft rts on my phone.. obviously pc would be better
[6:10:00] swordart2022: @Colt_Engineer you should not assume everyone negative even plays WoW in first place.
[6:10:02] Samurai3434: 84
[6:10:03] Milanesa_De_Pollo: pretty sure what they meant was the they wanted Blizzard to put the time and resources into Warcraft 4 instead of the mobile game.
[6:10:05] 無職提督: and dont forget the failure of Warcraft re"fund"
[6:10:06] Rexialiton: ppl needs to show some respect for other ppl. not just about this but in general
[6:10:14] swordart2022: @Colt_Engineer log in to wow ask people in game for opinion if you care.
[6:10:26] MisterD1rty: I think it was a great video and you did a good job @towelliee. Haters just gonna hate.
[6:10:42] Horseweave: @rexialiton I'm gonna have to disagree. Respect should be earned, not given.
[6:11:10] Malarick: Gotta give it a shot
[6:11:21] Erathizzle: why didn't they do mobile pet battles?
[6:11:24] Orion280: i recognize it's not made for me so i dont care might try it waiting for a doctor's appointment
[6:11:29] Colt_Engineer: my thought about the game is, ok cool a mobile game, I don't like mobile games but I don't care either to be outraged
[6:11:40] Ahram: do you still mythic raid?
[6:11:49] swordart2022: Reminds me back in my days playing custom tower defens in warcraft 3
[6:11:55] swordart2022: so i am big into it
[6:12:06] PsykosysGG: was there autoplay?

[6:12:18] Niksen_99: Feel like people complain just because its blizzard LUL If it was any other company
[6:12:20] Horseweave: @towelliee You gonna throw a M+ event for 9.2.5 for Cross Faction Party?
[6:12:35] Sylphy_TV: The * I'm boycotting WoW this expansion sucks* but buys it anyways commenters LUL

[6:13:23] Wcvechten: now you can do cross faction dance offs 😎
[6:13:29] aumixp: This cross-faction thing in wow.. Is it working in lfg or is it only through your battle.net?
[6:13:38] YardRage: historic covers both good and bad LUL
[6:13:42] MBG_95: yes in LFG
[6:13:44] xaeblue: oh its historic
[6:13:44] Samurai3434: need a slime
[6:13:46] AllHailSilence: did cross faction release?
[6:13:54] pakamov: Im hoping for xfaction guilds
[6:13:55] swordart2022: will get more people to play with is always W
[6:14:05] sLogOG: i think i saw a screenshot about the cross-faction thing, it's not working in lfr groups
[6:14:12] sLogOG: mrgm tweeted from ptr, no ?
[6:14:30] swordart2022: same
[6:14:33] MBG_95: season 1 was so long :D
[6:14:42] Horseweave: My guess is going to be Late June/ Early July
[6:14:52] Yagr6: just cut season 4 short
[6:15:01] Yagr6: fake season anyways
[6:15:21] xaeblue: the barrier to entry is ridiculous rn even with zm so they might consider it
[6:16:00] Horseweave: Do you not understand the upsurge of how many people will play in Season 4?
[6:16:00] MBG_95: what barrier to entry?
[6:16:25] Yagr6: oh you know leveling , renown, conduits , legendaries
[6:16:30] Horseweave: It wouldn't surprise me if we had multiple server crashes...
[6:16:32] Yagr6: gear
[6:16:48] Thoreya: leveling a barrier to entry, thats a new one
[6:17:13] swordart2022: @JagrZero called playing the game 4Head
[6:17:18] KaisenSiru: Definitely
[6:17:20] swordart2022: ooze is Pog
[6:17:23] Horseweave: That not a barrier. That's just you being lazy.
[6:17:32] Yagr6: @Thoreya they have a boost leveling is a chore for some
[6:17:43] MBG_95: renown is so quick, do the ZM campaign and you are half way there. conduits you can get everything to 226 because of that so ez, legendaries are cheaper than ever?
[6:18:03] KaisenSiru: Sadge
[6:18:15] swordart2022: rogue is so bad
[6:18:16] sLogOG: if you count leveling as a barrier, why do you even play an mmorpg game? go play a fighting game like street fighter or something lol
[6:18:26] swordart2022: Druid is Pepega strash /swipe spam just boring
[6:18:29] swordart2022: 1 button :/
[6:18:35] cabalish: philosophy change then
[6:18:36] maraz909: Trash and taunt
[6:18:37] Horseweave: Renown is a JOKE to get to max now. What?
[6:18:39] AllHailSilence: think all classes need a new spec or something
[6:18:43] swordart2022: Swipe should work differently.
[6:18:47] Yagr6: rebalance them
[6:18:49] TheSteve: @Towelliee bring back Lazer Bear
[6:18:51] RuggedRender: missin the scratch butt up against a tree skill
[6:18:54] RiskyBusines_ez: They're even buffing renown catch up to 60 from 40 lmao
[6:18:59] Highparkk_: yeah swipe should be buffed or reworked
[6:19:00] Rexialiton: @Horseweave I agree. I didn't mean, that respect should be "given". But to say that something is blah, blah, blah when watching the first 10min of it is just sad. ppl are becoming more and more like "we want this and only this. if we dont get this, all other "solution" is the worst shit ever". why so much hate. why not just try to believe in something. in this case Blizzard. if ppl hate Blizzard so much, why waste energy to constantly yell and shout at them to call them the worst u possibly can.
[6:19:05] MBG_95: make Maul a useful button again :D
[6:19:06] MrGharr: like buff mangle
[6:19:09] Lazugo: Steve go back to bed
[6:19:11] Highparkk_: mangle is useless too
[6:19:15] TheSteve: nou
[6:19:20] WundertueteGER: buff mangle and swipe by 1000%
[6:19:25] Sonkei: Make that shit cost rage again lmao
[6:19:33] Lazugo: And help to help towelliee
[6:19:36] swordart2022: YO MAUL OMEGALUL
[6:19:37] Spathotan: @Towelliee Make bear the DPS spec and Cat a tank similar to Vengenance DH? Or a dodge tank ala old school FF11 Ninja
[6:19:43] Highparkk_: i think mangle should be base aoe
[6:19:50] swordart2022: Maul exist so OMEGALUL with tthat
[6:19:51] MBG_95: pretty sure mangle is still better during Incarn on < 3 targets
[6:20:00] Kaiem: mangle and maul could be buffed, they are so weak
[6:20:02] Highparkk_: yeah maul is trash too
[6:20:03] WundertueteGER: maul OMEGALUL
[6:20:05] MarquisLek: maul sucks
[6:20:06] Sebell777: I dont have maul binded
[6:20:09] de_boinked: may the 4th be with you @towelliee , currently enjoying the uncharted gfuel from your code. Def amazing
[6:20:13] countrycount: i literally have not bound maul on my druid xD
[6:20:16] cruzeal: no one uses maul KEKW
[6:20:22] MarquisLek: i don't even have maul on my keybind
[6:20:27] Highparkk_: scratch replace maul Pog
[6:20:30] danksly: same
[6:20:32] aircy: maul has always been a rage dump but since the brought in ironfur  we dont need maul now
[6:20:33] 1Loremaster: its a good rage dump
[6:20:34] Eldartau: Moonfire is a joke on gaurdians
[6:20:36] MBG_95: it is just bad
[6:20:37] swordart2022: it does literally nothign rather iron fur spam
[6:20:39] skaya86: I think it's okay if they plain reduce aoe damage and increment single target, as far as aoe threat remains the same
[6:20:41] Waiden01: If I return to WoW in 9.2.5, am I forded to do Maw and Thorgast or I no longer have to? I really hated those places. Thanks
[6:20:45] Eldartau: How does that make sense at all
[6:20:46] valianya: Reduce the requirements to use the others, less rage less cooldown
[6:20:52] countrycount: for optimal gameplay probably not, but like...i never use it so i was like...one less button on my bars xD
[6:20:52] MarquisLek: any rage spent on maul is better spent on ironfur
[6:20:53] WundertueteGER: i dont use maul either i rather use ironfur
[6:21:04] swordart2022: moonfire is for range pulls
[6:21:31] MBG_95: Moonfire is your best ST button which is a joke
[6:21:33] Eldartau: I liked Lacerate and Pulverize for single target dps and threat. Building stacks and consuming for a bonus to threat or damage instead of just thrashing
[6:21:41] TigerRoll_Dev: Hey Towelliee, just getting back into the game. Was at 3k  in S1. If you were to pick between Paladin or Druid for all 9.2.5 content and DF, which would you pick and why?
[6:21:45] skaya86: Twilight devastation lol
[6:21:59] Horseweave: @rexialiton Why the hate to Blizzard? Simple: People just want to hate simply to hate. Not to say Blizzard isn't a good company, but like people, they CAN change.
[6:22:09] countrycount: new druid talent in dragonflight: Twilight Devastion XD
[6:22:10] chukudu: toilet devastation LUL
[6:22:15] skaya86: Yea it was every tank's main source of damage
[6:22:29] Highparkk_: unless you were in tol dagor and it went thru the wall and pulled the whole dungeon
[6:22:35] bloodword: 1 proc and become top dps
[6:22:37] cbapriest: corruption were lowkey awesome
[6:22:43] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee New talent system, twilight devastation is there LOL

[6:22:54] SK1NFATHER: Could implement some Territorial spells in keeping with the bear philosophy. They could definitely jazz up the spellbook a bit
[6:22:58] Hybriso: twilight depression when it didn't proc lol
[6:23:00] Wcvechten: acquisition was terrible though, even with the vendor
[6:23:07] valianya: I liked using pulverize when it gave extra damage resistance
[6:23:08] liberategeorge: tank-only heroic pugs with twilight dev was fun
[6:23:13] RiskyBusines_ez: stacking Echoing Void in raid was also awesome
[6:23:15] Shirey36: until the end
[6:23:19] Shirey36: then everyone stacked vers
[6:23:21] Shirey36: or mastery
[6:23:24] Highparkk_: yeah
[6:23:36] falldrgn: but it it was also feast or famine.. you either had the right rolls or you didnt
[6:23:37] liberategeorge: yeah organised groups could do mythic. heroic pugs could yolo
[6:23:45] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee 20 DK's were doing Nyalotha ye
[6:23:53] yo_JRod: Can you still get that fel bear skin?
[6:23:54] danksly: did like 2 bosses in 30 tank run no one knew mechanics at all
[6:23:57] RiskyBusines_ez: free rank1 parses in those 30 tank runs ;D
[6:24:05] raye_gaming22: corruption was ncie for every one who was not benched in prog
[6:24:12] falldrgn: Scripes all mage pug was hillarious
[6:24:14] ShintzTTV: Hello there, what resources do you suggest for new players who have not played since SSC 25m ... ? :D
[6:24:15] sLogOG: echo's full mage nyalotha was super fun too lol
[6:24:19] flame_eh: i personally thought the massive mage runs were hilarious with all that corruption
[6:24:39] valianya: Yes fel bear is from return of the mage tower
[6:24:55] donin: I thought the visions were dope
[6:24:59] StarPriestessShika: i think 40 priest onyxia is still my favorite memory of weird wow raid comps
[6:25:04] Shirey36: u have incarn u cant die!
[6:25:12] yo_JRod: Thanks @valianya
[6:25:21] ChimpanQ: corruption was fun
[6:25:23] ChimpanQ: very fun imo
[6:25:48] Horseweave: God, Corruptions were fun.
[6:25:58] Shirey36: remember havoc and the little tenticles they would spawn in pvp that would wreck shit
[6:26:10] Buckwink: only people who say corruption wasnt fun didnt play 8.3.5
[6:26:36] Horseweave: If they implement something similar in 10.0, I'm ALL IN IT!
[6:26:36] SK1NFATHER: I only remember Twilight Dev and Gushing Wounds
[6:27:00] MrGharr: can't wait for 10.0 to play multiple characters easily
[6:27:03] pereadin: 14 streets for gloves
[6:27:08] countrycount: it was also really fun to just stack haste corruptions and go mega fast permanetly xD
[6:27:16] Orion280: i miss sending baby frost dragons with frost DK icecap build with haste/mastery/crit corruption and just slamming
[6:27:28] findobin: I quit bfa early on but the most fun i had was dueling as a shaman sitting in ghost wolfand having all azerite traits in healing you in ghost wolf, so nobody could kill you LUL
[6:27:30] ZabberzTV: man i remember i had a protwarr using rally on a big pull and doing 30 million dmg in one pull
[6:27:42] Rexialiton: @Horseweave I just don't get the "hate simply to hate" kinda thing. We all can change for the better. I just believe that it goes hand in hand with believing in someone or something. No matter what it is
[6:27:45] ZabberzTV: man twilight deva
[6:27:47] pereadin: ohhhhh just remembered season finale of moon knight is today
[6:27:51] rohdey: can confirm, BFA was my first xpac and loved it despite the flaws
[6:27:56] Thoreya: 8.2 was legitimately the most fun i had in wow in a long time
[6:27:58] Buckwink: bfa was lowkey kina good
[6:28:01] MrGharr: 9.2 is really returner friendly.
[6:28:02] Thoreya: i played 8.2 an unhealthy amount
[6:28:12] Snookiful: I left in 8.1 and came back to shadowlands :D haha
[6:28:20] croppeast: @Towelliee Getting around to leveling a Monk for gold farming. Got any tips for speed lvling?
[6:28:25] amarranth: I loved warfront idea. so much potential....
[6:28:26] countrycount: and still people want items from old raids to be relevant througout the whole expansion
[6:28:33] Connectus: I didn't like the borrowed power at all in BFA and currently in Shadowlands, but that's just personal preference. Legion was still fun though
[6:29:24] unsuspectinghippo: What class is your main right now?
[6:29:29] Connectus: Yeah but the system worked better
[6:29:32] Connectus: It felt more rewarding imo
[6:29:42] Orion280: jebaited

[6:29:49] MrGharr: legion borrowed power made me quit for a while.
[6:29:51] RiskyBusines_ez: The group finder is bugged about Tazavesh
[6:29:53] findobin: but legion had illidan
[6:29:55] Orion280: had this happen way too many times trying to get the codex
[6:30:01] Highparkk_: legion leggo system was so funny, getting leggos out of chests in the open world lol
[6:30:02] bigman1987: what stats do i need to focus on my beast mastery hunter pls
[6:30:23] king_julian_96: just timed a theater 18
[6:30:27] MrGharr: legion lego was a frusttrating mess.
[6:30:32] Connectus: can't wait for the new talent system, that'll be fun to mess around with
[6:30:34] RiskyBusines_ez: it always show Streets initially even if you have a Gambit key, so you need to manually change it to Gambit and pref. note it - few people notice it
[6:30:48] pereadin: BRUH it was listed as a streets KEKW
[6:31:00] Shirey36: is is a coincidence bfa was the xpac with the most played tanks? i think not tanks loved corruption
[6:31:14] RiskyBusines_ez: @Towelliee look my last msg
[6:31:15] Highparkk_: @bigman1987 crit/haste I believe @bigman1987
[6:31:22] baaronthemonk: Morning towelliee
[6:31:24] MrGharr: I think thats a WA/addon that sets the groupfinder to streets auto.
[6:31:27] kimmo_gaming: How do you know what do they call streets in their village LOL
[6:31:46] danksly: on the + side pirate dragon
[6:32:03] Horseweave: @rexialiton It's basically instant gratification. If anybody can just follow along with the crowd, they will, even if they are in the wrong. No one like to be responsible anymore, so they will take the *easy way*out.
[6:32:03] bigman1987: thank you highparkk
[6:33:42] danksly: hope theres weird side quests in dragonflight where people turn out to be dragons
[6:33:50] Horseweave: Yeah... Guardian Druid is INSANE
[6:33:50] danksly: love it when people turn out to be dragons
[6:34:16] kappaday23: Kappa
[6:34:43] danksly: jaina a dreadlord u say? nope dragon
[6:34:44] RiskyBusines_ez: think you missed some count at the start xD
[6:35:22] net_mi: DHs man
[6:35:46] Rexialiton: @Horseweave Exactly. I'm just so tired of the ppl who just says shit without even thinking.
[6:36:14] RiskyBusines_ez: at the end? so you walk all the way back to the murlocs after last boss?
[6:36:31] dreamwalker213: @riskybusines_ez portal to the front
[6:37:06] RiskyBusines_ez: but why not just kill murlocs early? its fortified anyway, so do big pull with bl
[6:37:24] swordart2022: @RiskyBusines_ez bloodlust on start sooner you use sooner you can use again.
[6:37:39] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Well, it has a nordic guy boss, it has a shore part, a woman as a last boss, its Maw of Souls for sure LOL
[6:37:41] Thoriakk: Hey @Towelliee will you give a try to the Destroyer in Lost Ark when it will be out in May ?

[6:37:57] barenvonghoul: may the 4th be with you @Towelliee
[6:38:02] RiskyBusines_ez: i've never even seen people get murlocs after last boss XD always just did big pulls early
[6:38:07] Deadcells: Good morning!
[6:38:11] RiskyBusines_ez: so this is news to me
[6:38:26] ThatGuyFayde: imagine spending all that time doing trash and your team wipes on the boss, easier to do trash afetrwards

[6:38:47] gzus81: you also get better lust timings going boss first
[6:38:52] Hank_Chinaski: Hey Towelliee, when is the Draginflight Alpha starting?
[6:38:57] RiskyBusines_ez: @ThatGuyFayde so you cant wipe on boss if you do it early? hmm
[6:39:30] ThatGuyFayde: @RiskyBusines_ez thats the point, saves time if your team cant clear the boss lol
[6:39:53] RiskyBusines_ez: @ThatGuyFayde maybe thats the pug strat where you have no faith in the random people i guess
[6:39:55] big808: this mans just doesn't get it lol
[6:40:24] ThatGuyFayde: @RiskyBusines_ez most of M= is pug run so its very relevant
[6:40:25] StarPriestessShika: i mean doing the murlocs last is literally the mdi strat base
[6:40:27] vadder_fister: dh= sigma male
[6:40:27] RiskyBusines_ez: i mean i've run tons of Gambits with pugs obv - its the fastest key to do, ez weeklies - just never seen it  this way, but thats fine
[6:40:30] ThatGuyFayde: m+**

[6:40:58] Grinch2129: this gon be spicy

[6:41:32] YardRage: YardRage subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 1 month streak! mornin'
[6:41:49] RiskyBusines_ez: @NekoNaedri they do murlocs first in mdi
[6:42:13] Grinch2129: 12sec cd, yes
[6:42:15] Lyvemannen: 12 sec
[6:42:24] vignola99: @xXSiebzehnXx 13$ is pretty cheap, and the sub fee is the best thing about the game tbh, keeps the bots away (i know they're still here but much less than a F2P game ), and its consistent revenue for the devs, sub games are always the best in quality imo
[6:42:25] big808: prolly doesn't have it on his bars
[6:42:41] unsuspectinghippo: My favorite Towelliee moment is when he accidentally hit his dalaran hearthstone during the legion raid boss (don’t remember which boss) lol
