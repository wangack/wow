[0:30:47] Bret36: Buff rsham 🙏🏻
[0:30:47] SpeedyMcD: if a healer isnt number 1 every healer is bad. this is how wow works
[0:30:51] Harleybane: to be fair @yumytv most non meta classes have a handful of high people beacuse they are replacing one of the other meta in a group. now take groups without a single meta class in them and you get way different io
[0:30:56] xDeceit: Hpal's live like MW's do, but have a lot of externals and good 5 man utility
[0:31:16] marcosell: to get easy title i just gotta play on us I guess, fkin eu players too good
[0:31:21] zachl_: 28s and some 29s
[0:31:22] dimsy__: ye and some 29's
[0:31:32] Lottinius: cutoff in china is 1io Aware
[0:31:36] uniqueusername7: @yumytv no memerino, you know how in mobas a char is op with a 55% winrate because its having that much influence and its only 20% of the team.  apply the same logic to "spec isnt that bad it can do 29s"
[0:31:53] uniqueusername7: even a dogshit spec can do 29s by getting carried
[0:31:56] Freddyfx36: a spec doesnt have to suck to be overshadowed
[0:32:02] simplepathwow: YEP
[0:32:05] Bret36: You're getting one guy'd
[0:32:06] formation2252: Why would Pally get buffed?
[0:32:08] simplepathwow: lets not talk about raid tho
[0:32:08] Hemenia: dude i said exactly that on reddit and got called an idiot
[0:32:11] MicHawkh: eu > na m+
[0:32:14] formation2252: I mean they need a buff but why>
[0:32:15] Harleybane: @uniqueusername7 ^ this, 4x meta and 1 non meta and you get somewhat high
[0:32:21] IAttackYou: dude just wait until healer discord hears about this
[0:32:22] tazmaniatico: Do you wanna chill in a EB + 27?
[0:32:25] Lottinius: its catshit SeemsGood
[0:32:26] uniqueusername7: not saying paly is bad, just saying the argument that it can do 29s is useless
[0:32:34] carlos_the_7th: name a healer spec that can't do all 30's
[0:32:36] IAttackYou: where is nickgaming
[0:32:39] zachl_: its bad but are u really like healing these mechs or are u organizing cds to barely scrape by
[0:32:40] IAttackYou: @nickgaming11
[0:32:43] IAttackYou: where you at
[0:32:46] zachl_: hpal is not healing any of these mechs

[0:33:12] Freddyfx36: maybe ret and u go mw
[0:33:18] Harleybane: @yumytv bro i shit you not, i got a whisper after a key i did on my Rshaman and he said "im suprised we even timed it since youre a Resto shaman" LUL
[0:33:58] maenkins: sounds like an ele shaman
[0:33:59] maenkins: LUL

[0:34:12] SpeedyMcD: whats the problem with preservation?
[0:34:16] Larocca_88: people always talk about how good some spec's utility is when the throughput starts to look good, warlock was completely ignored in m+ for like all of BFA then suddenly end of SL people were raving about how good healthstones and gates were once destro was doing infinite damage
[0:34:19] simplepathwow: big ring for raid

[0:34:29] simplepathwow: Deadge tokens
[0:34:36] qtceef: pres is insane
[0:34:38] qtceef: meta inc
[0:34:45] Freddyfx36: i dont like their 4set
[0:34:47] Nitruos: its so good 0 in title range
[0:34:48] flem_wow: tiny lizard arms and ranged in narnia
[0:34:48] streyeker: @yumytv  that ring is semi bis for raid - hpal main
[0:34:56] Nitruos: 30 yards is not fun
[0:35:00] Lothland: feels like shit to heal (better when they switched back orb), range sucks on more fights and all their healing is CD (short but still) related
[0:35:14] cucumbertoessniffa: yeah the 30 yard stuff takes me out of it
[0:35:16] flem_wow: like s1
[0:35:29] uniqueusername7: even when evoker was op in season 1 the playerbase was so bonobo that it was useless in lower keys
[0:35:31] sangcti: rsham rise up
[0:35:34] Bret36: Like how mw is this season, so op people will play it
[0:35:37] Lothland: feels like you have to gamble people's health so you get full value from your bigger things (like Sbloom)
[0:35:44] TerraTuned: @yumytv would evoker just be always aug / non-aug spec and if aug is good, why play other 2?
[0:35:46] uniqueusername7: if in doubt invite priest to pug because its the most braindead healer every time
[0:35:53] yctnm: pres is fun af to play
[0:36:19] Freddyfx36: aug is not meta?
[0:36:21] Nitruos: its still in a lot of top keys
[0:36:24] throwmasterlol: vault vid?
[0:36:24] Harleybane: @yctnm until ppl are 31 yards away from you
[0:36:26] Lottinius: aug is just comfy to have tho,
[0:36:29] cucumbertoessniffa: literally in the top 3 timed lol
[0:36:47] maenkins: 0 healer ICANT
[0:36:49] symbolicben: i think u can play aug but i think thats comfort pick
[0:36:50] uniqueusername7: still literally the most popular dps
[0:36:54] uniqueusername7: "a fair amount"
[0:36:55] uniqueusername7: nice cope
[0:37:05] Lottinius: Oldge2 RAGEY
[0:37:11] yctnm: Harleybane yeah but thats a problem with teammates and communication, not the spec
[0:37:21] simplepathwow: disc needs the aug i think
[0:37:24] Nitruos: thaners group  is playing it
[0:37:29] yourfavoritegorf: it is meta, but not THE meta
[0:37:30] cucumbertoessniffa: the top 2 keys had no healer?
[0:37:31] symbolicben: @maenkins the healer goes priest for first boss in atal then swaps back
[0:37:34] cucumbertoessniffa: am i  dumb?
[0:37:40] cucumbertoessniffa: oh
[0:37:42] symbolicben: just because rezan doesnt do anything
[0:37:43] cucumbertoessniffa: that makes sense
[0:37:46] Freddyfx36: i mean if its in most games +32 its meta
[0:37:49] waelrick: aug most popular dps? mage exists LUL
[0:38:17] Valanya11: 32 AD no healer? OMEGALUL
[0:38:31] TerraTuned: @yumytv what i was trying to say with that is that either aug is good enough to be picked, or the other 2 specs of evoker have to be super good and aug bad
[0:38:39] Lottinius: legendary effect
[0:38:50] zachl_: pugs hate aug
[0:38:52] Tofterid: music realy low
[0:39:05] Nitruos: i think thats only true for dev
[0:39:08] YANYOoo: pugs love aug
[0:39:13] Nitruos: if pres is good u dont care if aug is bis as well
[0:39:33] cucumbertoessniffa: mages arent people
[0:39:39] simplepathwow: mages Susge
[0:39:51] Lottinius: 0.2shaman DESPAIR
[0:39:57] unodapally: When is the pirate patch coming??
[0:40:12] uniqueusername7: they should change the filters to be highest key minus 3, highest key minus 6 etc etc
[0:40:13] Freddyfx36: it's over for shamans
[0:40:26] streyeker: switch it to last season lol
[0:40:30] Imch1ngy: are people having issue with the weakaura addon?
[0:40:31] 407c: they said mid march for pirate
[0:40:34] reppap: i would not have expected moonkins being this prevalent
[0:40:41] reppap: at the start of the season
[0:40:42] Nitruos: theres no plans this week
[0:40:42] symbolicben: i feel like mage, druid, priest, aug, ret, and warlock to extent are like all the best dps.
[0:40:42] Nico_vdM: For me it seems that aug and spriest are swopping places in comps
[0:40:51] Lottinius: good meta
[0:40:55] streyeker: huh
[0:41:47] Nitruos: i swear i have 1 character thats vaults are just so bad all season
[0:41:53] boatdong: how much haste are you going for on rdruid?
[0:42:03] Voyburke: why is pres so bad this season?
[0:42:17] feen33: @Voyburke it was horrible s2 as well
[0:42:21] MicHawkh: Dogwater sadge
[0:42:29] K4lsdern: yo

[0:42:55] cucumbertoessniffa: does your back hurt from carrying dorki in keys?
[0:42:56] JackOfAllApocalypses: speaking as an old man, that's how you know you're old
[0:43:19] unodapally: I think cutoff will be 3650
[0:43:34] zachl_: @unodapally i agree, 50-60 is cutoff and 70 is safe
[0:48:01] Niroggo: wideVIBE

[0:48:08] minothecat: Enjoy the taco
[0:48:09] 407c: did you say found a taco?

[0:52:24] luigiisama: word I went to an anjunadeep show last summer, was solid
[0:52:39] adleydarling: i hope its like a ffxiv ultimate raid or something
[0:52:49] Nitruos: they specifically said no raids are coming out p sure
[0:53:07] dorki: ff raids are crazy
[0:53:22] Harleybane: pirate patch is gonna be a Alternative reality dungeon where deadmines and freehold has merged together
[0:53:30] Nitruos: dont say that ur gonna trigger me
[0:53:30] dorki: wow players hate that
[0:53:37] Nitruos: im a 90s non resetting class in raid rn
[0:53:43] Nitruos: its the most frustrating shit in the universe
[0:53:44] 407c: i wish i had FF friends to raid there
[0:53:58] Vyndrodis: FF raiding is genuinely damn fun to pop in for a season, get your stuff, come back later
[0:54:00] Valanya11: dude on tindral
[0:54:04] Hemenia: only good part about fyrakkk prog
[0:54:06] Valanya11: warrior cds dont reset
[0:54:08] Hemenia: and tindral actually ye
[0:54:11] IAttackYou: have you got farmed harder by anything more than elden ring bosses
[0:54:11] Valanya11: so if you wipe as I pop
[0:54:15] Valanya11: its not up next pull
[0:54:26] Nitruos: wait for my stasis guys
[0:54:34] Nitruos: need 45s on branch
[0:54:45] Nitruos: my ashes trinket debuff doesnt reset btw
[0:54:45] dorki: yea but raids dont feel alive if its just a boss fight simulator
[0:55:02] Hemenia: @dorki you don't feel alive
[0:55:03] IAttackYou: trueee
[0:55:18] PsychoxDH: log on 14
[0:55:20] dorki: imagine molten core where u just spawn in front of bosses
[0:55:21] Nitruos: nothing makes me feel alive like afking in front of bosses
[0:55:26] PsychoxDH: come learn with twicks
[0:55:39] t4pekid: where Elden SNIFFA
[0:55:42] Harleybane: 31 pulls smolderon then we went to tindral and had 441 KEKW
[0:55:50] tigglers: ga?
[0:55:54] shadoomoon: It's the same thing in a M+.  You're on the last boss, you wipe and spawn at the beginning of the dungeon.  Blizzard needs to fix this shit to ALWAYS spawn at the last boss killed.
[0:56:02] K4lsdern: xdd
[0:56:04] simplepathwow: Susge
[0:56:07] Nitruos: LUL

[0:56:32] K4lsdern: PauseChamp
[0:56:36] itsparvati: it takes a certain mind set to raid prog
[0:56:41] Shrimp37: it's like they know it's a problem because they put the speed buff in this raid but why not just put checkpoints like fyrakk or tindral
[0:56:46] Nitruos: season4 fun is gonna make us all ff14 gamers
[0:56:46] IAttackYou: you have elden ring and when you finished, dlc would come out

[0:57:04] Larocca_88: xdd
[0:57:09] Nitruos: thats some cope
[0:57:15] Vyndrodis: Difference between a good healer in 14 raiding and a bad healer in 14 healing is a huge gap honestly

[2:35:56] tvilk: no you only lose souls
[2:36:02] Vestaliss: They just come from cave exploring usually
[2:36:04] dknamey: farm them in caves
[2:36:09] somancy: You probably got higher level smithing stones
[2:36:10] nerefwow: you've got the stones
[2:36:12] nerefwow: but not the runes
[2:36:15] somancy: since you were in a higher level area

[2:37:34] Basic_3: Do you have a bow?
[2:37:34] JoshuaNLG: was just wondering if it was changed and the screenshots are wrong, or if the import went wrong somewhere
[2:37:43] tvilk: @JoshuaNLG What resolution are you playing on?
[2:37:49] JoshuaNLG: 1080x1090
[2:37:50] scrubbybubbles42: lil bro

[2:39:48] BigTrout3: if you praise a message, the author gets healing flask charges
[2:39:49] JoshuaNLG: Never healed before in WoW past leveling dungeons, so just wanted to get my UI properly setup for it all so i enjoy it
[2:40:10] knersh_: every named cave has a boss encounter
[2:40:18] tvilk: yeah but growl aren't you playing on 1440p?
[2:40:21] JoshuaNLG: Ah ok :) Good to know, thank you! just wanted to make sure the import didn't go screwy

[2:44:39] knersh_: it's supposed to be one of the first bosses after tutorial
[2:45:11] tvilk: I remember I got against him after defeating Tree Sentinel, Margit and 2nd boss and was like "wtf is this"
[2:45:13] twish117: i mean a ot of the mini bosses are like that. cave ones at elast
[2:45:37] knersh_: there are like 3+ bosses in limgrave and the south island

[2:46:01] baseboned: "directions are for casuals"

[2:46:51] BigTrout3: monkaW
[2:46:53] knersh_: exploring XD
[2:47:09] nivereno: I think the game is sort of intended for dark souls veterans and gamers to push through the challenge, but they've sprinkled in a bit of go around do easy stuff get stronger to make it more open
[2:47:11] Zynneh: Try exploring. But. Hole.
[2:47:13] GratefulRedd: get shiny

[2:48:41] Anathenma: There is no inventory weight, only equipped items
[2:48:42] knersh_: no weight limit or inevtory limit

[4:31:46] tvilk: growl what made you choose samurai btw, hwat was the appeal to you
[4:31:50] m_dep: how have you been liking your first souls like?
[4:32:04] IAttackYou: cus he is a weeb
[4:32:04] tvilk: weeb
[4:32:06] Kantalop3: actual weeb
[4:32:07] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd
[4:32:07] lord_rimheart: WEEBSDETECTED
[4:32:07] tvilk: got it
[4:32:08] Tellas: He's defintiely a weeb
[4:32:12] thepleasuremachine: it's ok growl
[4:32:29] m_dep: makes sense
[4:32:51] lord_rimheart: didn't start wretch = overleveled xdd
[4:33:03] tvilk: Have you seen the Dorkis? The bears? xdd
[4:33:15] m_dep: would be cool to see you play ds sometime in the future if you're less happy with open world
[4:33:19] m_dep: combat is obviously just as good
[4:33:52] tvilk: @m_dep i definitely prefer DS over Elden Ring. The open world kinda ruins it for me
[4:34:11] knersh_: that is a spirit spring
[4:34:22] knersh_: you can land in it safely
[4:34:30] ssj_lenin: on the horse
[4:34:33] m_dep: @tvilk yeah I always love new fromsoft content, but I've replayed ER the least since the overworld feels taxing compared to the goats like BB, DS3, etc.
[4:34:39] knersh_: torrent
[4:35:14] tvilk: @m_dep I just feel aimless in ER. In DS it's always 1 way forward, sometimes 2. But generally if you're in doubt just hold W
[4:35:16] vellocets: lmfao
[4:35:17] nivereno: KEKW
[4:35:18] dknamey: xdd

[4:35:27] knersh_: missed you have double jump XD
[4:35:28] TheUncleJohn: bamboozled
[4:35:31] nightbreeze93: i thought the biggest problem with ER open world was possibility of overleveling Sadge
[4:35:36] nightbreeze93: exploring is fun
[4:35:37] GratefulRedd: @tvilk If you could get ashes of war/weapon arts in DS then maybe. Also I like being able to parry every boss in ER
[4:35:39] vellocets: coulda double jumped
[4:36:08] knersh_: you are falling short of the edge XD
[4:36:16] BigTrout3: i was wondering if you're ever told Torrent could double jump
[4:36:19] Exobroke: hey growl, how do u enjoy elden ring? :)
[4:36:32] tvilk: @GratefulRedd Ashes? Weapon arts? What are you talking about? Me oonga boonga big axe R1 xdd
[4:36:50] Hyposeidon: Hey growl
[4:37:15] GratefulRedd: @tvilk hahaha cries in Dex

[4:37:33] BigTrout3: uuh invisible wall
[4:37:38] BigTrout3: ?
[4:37:50] lord_rimheart: the camera going up when you jump really helps there xdd
[4:38:02] knersh_: no that jump is possible
[4:38:22] dorki: go in there
[4:38:23] dorki: evergaol
[4:38:28] nightbreeze93: first gaol Pog
[4:38:33] dorki: o get ur money first
[4:38:39] IAttackYou: go back Growl
[4:38:41] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd
[4:39:38] tvilk: watching this makes me want to replay ds3 but i know i'll quit of boredom before that 3-man boss xdd
[4:39:58] IAttackYou: CLAP
[4:40:05] Mindris_: Monka
[4:40:09] tvilk: abyss watchers was the name, i forgor
[4:40:14] Mythsarion: Oh boy, lets go
[4:40:22] thepleasuremachine: SCARED
[4:40:23] Kantalop3: despairge
[4:40:26] Mythsarion: ur in jail :D
[4:40:33] BigTrout3: o7
[4:40:37] nightbreeze93: tvilk did you play sekiro
[4:40:43] IAttackYou: his weapon is really good
[4:40:43] ssj_lenin: o7
[4:40:47] skarg__: o7
[4:40:49] zachl_: @chrono_za
[4:40:56] dknamey: this weapon is sick if you can kill it
[4:40:59] tvilk: @nightbreeze93 Little bit, but I didn't like the gameplay of Parry'ing and Stagger bar
[4:41:04] IAttackYou: he can def kill it
[4:41:14] dorki: o shit i didnt realize this is abyss watcher
[4:41:31] ssj_lenin: hes kinda more like a boreal outrider knight
[4:41:38] nightbreeze93: @tvilk ah too bad, i thought it was good change from usual ds stuff
[4:41:41] tvilk: @nightbreeze93 I only got to kill the lady with the threads and needles in the village on fire, and then I got past the big snake in the mountain pass thats about it
[4:41:49] IAttackYou: xddPeat
[4:41:53] IAttackYou: growl is getting fuckedup
[4:42:04] Larocca_88: EZ boss next try
[4:42:10] knersh_: get you runes before you enter again
[4:42:10] skarg__: garf 1
[4:42:14] tvilk: @nightbreeze93 yeah i understand why people liked it, but it just didn't fit my playstyle at all. I like taking it slow, watching movement and getting 1 hit in and then go back to being a turtle.. Can't do that in sekiro
[4:42:15] IAttackYou: imagine no Uppies on the weapon
[4:42:19] IAttackYou: you hit it for 100 damage instead
[4:42:19] vellocets: i missed him killing the tree sentinel
[4:42:21] vellocets: how did that go
[4:42:21] IAttackYou: xddPeat
[4:42:57] nightbreeze93: @tvilk yeah it's a lot faster but that's why it's so different, the parry stagger stuff is a bit strange at first but i grew to like it. dark souls roll gameplay is weird at first too
[4:43:14] Larocca_88: Pog
[4:43:17] IAttackYou: holyFUCKINGshit he is dong it
[4:43:26] tvilk: @nightbreeze93 yeah 100%, but I just like turtle meta
[4:44:08] skarg__: garf 2
[4:44:10] IAttackYou: dude, a fucking gold fish beat this game
[4:44:11] nightbreeze93: there's always armored core
[4:44:13] IAttackYou: you got it
[4:44:22] Vestaliss: btw your weapon does bloodloss too
[4:44:37] tvilk: Same thing for me in Monster Hunter. I like staying back and watching the Monsters do their thing until I can learn when and where I can get a few good hits in and then hang back again with my big ass sword
[4:45:03] thepleasuremachine: growl going in
[4:45:14] nightbreeze93: @tvilk gotcha
[4:45:22] IAttackYou: @tvilk i like to learn with my face
[4:45:29] skarg__: garf 3
[4:45:34] grigocell: are there any predictions for wow season 4 healer meta at the moment
[4:45:38] SpeedyMcD: its cool man you got a couple hundred more bosses left in game lol
[4:45:46] IAttackYou: @grigocell your favorite one
[4:45:49] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd
[4:45:52] tvilk: @IAttackYou Oh yeah? You want to get to know me maybe? Shygers
[4:45:56] xGuiha: @yumytv dont you have inside info
[4:46:03] Hyposeidon: did they release s4 dungeons?
[4:46:13] IAttackYou: cantaISee
[4:46:14] thepleasuremachine: hpal bout to be back on top baybee Schemege
[4:46:20] IAttackYou: maybe
[4:46:29] tvilk: @Hyposeidon Don't need to. It's either 8 DF dungeons minus Mega dungeon, or 10 dungeons including the Mega dungeon
