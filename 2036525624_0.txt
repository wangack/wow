[0:16:29] connernumse: heart rate and losing weight has nothing to do with each other?
[0:16:30] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: got losing wieght the best solutin is either treadmill or a running thingy

[0:17:11] connernumse: heavy weight training is the best for losing weight

[0:17:27] Indomitablez: Do you have the lingering cough? Mine will not go away.
[0:17:35] Grabakh: its still a cal deficit :)
[0:17:41] biglake_11: powerlifting wont make you lose weight lol been there done that
[0:17:44] Larrysix: actualy u want to do both, start heavy weights than do cardio
[0:18:01] connernumse: true
[0:18:02] Pr0fan1ty: A well rounded work out regime with lifting/cardio/dieting is the way to loose weight
[0:18:03] ghouliett: the rare bug in southern barrens has a great xp turn in
[0:18:12] biglake_11: if you wanna lose weight in the gym, you should be doing like 3 sets of 8-12
[0:18:17] ghouliett: but has a crazy res timer
[0:18:21] youwiththefeds: I think just eating less and lots of cardio is definitely best
[0:18:27] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: Cross Trainer or Treadmill os the loss weigh i thin
[0:18:37] benbreezi: the best way to lose weight is actually to play wow and only pvp so yeah..
[0:18:46] connernumse: weight training does burn alot, heart rate has nothing to do with it...
[0:18:47] BAnsMaxTV: yo
[0:18:47] Nightbot: yo
[0:18:53] Larrysix: just dont eat
[0:18:54] the_snarf: let's queue it my guy
[0:18:54] drvichyssoise: if you eat lets say 1k cal's a day and do nothing. do you still lose weight?

[3:52:26] eezobtw: what if they cleared gold each phase lmao
[3:52:29] KonQel: i mean there are way mroe efficient ways of farming gold than farming quests
[3:52:29] Hunhm: EU

[3:52:38] crazychris2108: no hes a EU andy
[3:53:01] jschroe3: i think he means that gold at lvl 25 isnt going to matter too much when it gets super inflated at lvl 40
[3:53:21] jschroe3: like 25s now have thousands, lvl40s are going to have tens of thousands
[3:53:23] supersuhmz: that guys a smarticle

[3:55:27] Emph1: u only need 215 to use them I think
[3:55:33] theNizzmo: probably intentional since no one plays gnome
[3:55:56] miciahclay: 250 for tauren
[3:56:03] KonQel: blizz just blatantly nerfed horde with giving droods WF, ruining ashenvale herb farming and make every fcking rune in ally zones
[3:56:04] theNizzmo: Taurens now are the only ones at 25 that can pick Goldthorn
[3:56:14] Indomitablez: @SONII Staysafe has been farming herbs on his tauren for 3-4 weeks to sell right away for consumes p2
[3:56:16] XaleEroomTV: It'll explain
[3:56:18] theNizzmo: just stock pile for next phase and sell early

[3:58:16] buzz97: longer than p1 for sure
[3:58:19] bubblesthebelfwarrior: ez 2 and a half months inc
[3:58:20] jschroe3: 10
[3:58:20] djOrris: I mean it has to be 3 months if its 4 phases in one year
[3:58:20] KonQel: atleast there will be more content in each phase naturally
[3:58:21] peacant: good cause ima be in japan for the first two weeks lol
[3:58:22] jschroe3: yea
[3:58:22] yokelono: they gotta milk the subs bro
[3:58:27] oakleafresin: 8
[3:58:52] Boundbyfire: yeap
[3:58:54] KonQel: fckyes
[3:58:54] pottyswagfilms: true
[3:58:55] KnoxxGaming: 100% agree
[3:58:56] limburgse: jup
[3:58:56] Tdoh__: facts
[3:58:56] Hunhm: not long enough, still not seen honed~ on rogue :<
[3:58:57] TobyNova: yeh deffo
[3:59:00] Cubanito06: people were recruting for icc 25  in LFG SOD
[3:59:01] Tdoh__: ive met a bunch of new players in sod as well
[3:59:01] johnnyyttv: for sure
[3:59:01] jiggsawpuzzlemanes: Has content too
[3:59:07] Thetoast08: retail players are slaves to the game
[3:59:08] TobyNova: wowisback
[3:59:09] orphesis: 100%
[3:59:11] peacant: tbh, i think retail has a lot of hype too
[3:59:15] zdravimdruzstvo: yeah, coz its not so timeconsuming to get 25 and you can play with friends
[3:59:23] Indomitablez: I think p1 is just a little longer because they are using it as a test to fix bugs for p2. So p2 might actually only be the same timewise as p1 and they push p3 out in 8-10 weeks
[3:59:32] KonQel: well they probably see the down in playercount aswell with draggin it out too long
[3:59:33] Cubanito06: i feel bad for them
[3:59:47] Cubanito06: naw
[3:59:48] peacant: like 3 xpacs, so much content to do, the game is actually pretty visually appealing too
[3:59:51] KnoxxGaming: the retail players
[3:59:52] KnoxxGaming: xD
[4:00:10] KonQel: ye that is true the subs will still be active
[4:00:12] Cubanito06: the players playing retail are playing atari and we here with our state of the art classic XD
[4:00:26] KonQel: its just a casino
[4:00:26] rightonkeww: p1 had holidays in them that extended it, but leveling 25-40 is gonna take alot longer than 1-25 for the fact of questing areas/density. Then take into account the casual player base which they are targetting
[4:00:28] floppa1g: its not the same game anymore
[4:00:28] chefbubbles24: I just started playing SOD and really enjoy it. I normally only play retail
[4:00:29] Tingels: what is the number of retail player you speak of?
[4:00:29] TobyNova: Yeh it will be like when TBC came out and there was so much lag at the portal haha
[4:00:36] rightonkeww: p2 will be as long or longer than p1
[4:00:43] Cubanito06: you are playing a cell phone game on your computer..thats retail
[4:00:44] Indomitablez: They just cant fuck up SoD. Im afraid they will add things in that make it feel like retail and it will lose the "classic" player
[4:00:46] TheSward: retail sucks, imo
[4:00:46] fonziing: Retail wow looks goofy to me
[4:01:07] peacant: retail is so bursty right now, but the apm on almost all classes is so high, And with solo q and rnaked 3s both pretty popular its a lot of fun. Farmin in SoD while in SS q
[4:01:14] djOrris: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0NCMuLZWD4 I loved watching this theory where the events in retail are happening in SOD and they might be connected soniiSaiyan
[4:01:15] Harenzo: retail you can play for 2 hours, do a ton of content, not say anything to anyone, not leave your spot just port in and do content, collect and leave
[4:01:25] oakleafresin: WTF he read my comment
[4:01:36] BlazyFM: bigbrain
[4:01:38] KonQel: Idk i hope they understand they have a split playerbase and that wont probably change, i think they will keep SoD for us old farts
[4:01:44] KonQel: Might be copium idk
[4:01:51] birdi1337: got 29 quests prep for next phase I think I’m going to turn them in for gold
[4:01:54] Cubanito06: so whats your next season you think >_>
[4:01:57] BlazyFM: nah that was predicted in start of BFA
[4:01:59] birdi1337: 20
[4:02:02] BlazyFM: good call
[4:02:11] hunigsbase: how much is sod playerbase down right now
[4:02:13] chilemangx: if they make SOD a tie into to have to play retail ill be iffed haha
[4:02:14] Cubanito06: can we get CC this guys voice sucks
[4:02:22] chilemangx: ill be miffed*
[4:02:32] KonQel: HUH
[4:02:42] DJ_VS: no way blizzard is smart enough to do this.
[4:02:44] KnoxxGaming: Aint never been whispered idk.
[4:03:14] Cubanito06: so we are playing in a time machine is what hes arguing @SONII
[4:03:14] TheSward: why the hell would they connect retail and classic, two different player bases
[4:03:17] KnoxxGaming: I feel like people stretch so far on stuff like this.
[4:03:27] BlazyFM: the battle within says it all the titel :D
[4:03:35] KonQel: Had a talk with a bud that thought that aswell, that they would somehow merge retail/sod/classic someway
[4:03:49] TheSward: @KonQel lol that makes no sense
[4:04:12] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[4:04:17] KonQel: @TheSward Well it makes sense in the way to have one team doing everything, how it would work idk and i dont believe it but he had some good points
[4:04:19] djOrris: djOrris is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to SONII's community! They've gifted a total of 15 in the channel! 
[4:04:20] djOrris: djOrris gifted a Tier 1 sub to ankafa!

[4:04:57] TheSward: @KonQel two completely different player bases. retail players dont want to play classic, and classic players dont want to play retail. that move would alienate the ENTIRE playerbase

[4:11:07] lethargicm00se: I mean there's nothing in the chapel at all

[4:39:29] photek_tn: How do you play your class in reverse????
[4:39:44] Runekdabest: I was in ''parse'' run with a hunter who had 1.7 average logs over 7 runs
[4:39:46] b_argy: Ive never looked at logs can you explain logs for healers? He said they are excluded, why is that? O.o
[4:39:52] Cubanito06: BUT THEN THE PREMADES WANT TO SEE YOUR PARSES TOO
[4:40:06] spike82q: kk hear me out...... i didnt know my rotation, and just hit 25 and was invited to a bfd , and they logged it,
[4:40:06] Runekdabest: His logs were 1.7 KEKW
[4:40:07] Indomitablez: They shouldnt get rid of premade vs pug but they should have it if you are in a group you have a very high chance to get another premade but you still have like a 5% chance to get a pug
[4:40:30] wednesdayb: had a mage in my guild parse 0, its a wild world out there
[4:40:32] conradical93: my healer logs are ok but they can def get wonky
[4:40:32] luzid7: if your team are good and don't get muchdmg you have grey logs as a heal^^
[4:40:33] ziiakk_: ConcernDoge
[4:40:35] buzz97: @b_argy the less dmg ppl take the worse your log will be, good groups take little damage
[4:40:36] JEpic77: healing logs are skewed because of the raid taking dmg. if your raid does well and takes minimal dmg, your logs will suck
[4:40:39] Runekdabest: To parse as healer u just need shit group KEKW
[4:40:40] lethargicm00se: Easiest way to solve the premade problem is make an inventive buff to rep and honor for solo queing.
[4:40:44] TobyNova: LUL
[4:40:51] buzz97: @b_argy since there is no dmg to heal
[4:41:05] Cubanito06: just sent you an email about your cars extended warranty hommie @SONII

[4:51:55] Honeypaw: PopNemo
[4:51:59] Indomitablez: GDKP would be fine for me people didnt buy gold and inflat the cost so those who dont buy gold cant afford anything
[4:51:59] authoraborealis: ya if it werent for gold buying with rmt GDKP would be perfect
[4:52:02] karrots96: GDKP's are fine. It's Gold buying that is not.
[4:52:07] Cubanito06: ^^
[4:52:14] KonQel: Well damn boys time run some GDKP's, brb
[4:52:16] Cubanito06: but you cannot seperate them now
[4:52:17] TheSward: this is what big gdkps wants you to believe
[4:52:29] shiftbbg: happened rto me on staff in guild run
[4:52:31] authoraborealis: ive been in guilds where we've done that to random pugs, true
[4:52:32] Cubanito06: they are valid but flawed
[4:52:49] CptCrabapple: This guy for sure works in political PR
[4:52:52] Runekdabest: GDKPs are fine just would be actually good if gold buying wasn't a thing
[4:53:19] KonQel: They are good yep
[4:53:35] rawlexdota: I do raids with randoms on my priest rolling ms>os  everything is fine
[4:53:36] Chipnizzle: Something cozy about the way this is written
[4:53:40] KonQel: That right there is what i say aswell, ppl dont like it because they dont like to farm gold
[4:53:45] TobyNova: I bet China is just another world
[4:53:48] KonQel: its*
[4:53:58] Nightbot: GHOST is having a buy one get one 50% off sale on ALL protein powder, use code "SONII" for an additional 20% off!!! ghostlifestyle.com // uk.ghostlifestyle.com
[4:54:17] 冂凵乃口: gdkp is best sistem for pugs true
[4:54:17] KonQel: People farming gold is so fcking rich, but people dont do it and wont buy gold themselfs so they cry instead - but i actually agree
[4:54:17] spike82q: If gdkp's was using gold Only actually obtained thorugh non botted applications,  GDKP's would be perfect,  but as of right now it incentivizes gold laundering
[4:54:23] HarryJPotter94: tldr?
[4:54:27] TheSward: gdkps arent the problem, its gold buying that ruins it
[4:54:34] Cubanito06: except it doesnt when people are robbing the bank to fund their cut
[4:54:37] drvichyssoise: @spike82q RT
[4:54:39] iPlayCuzFun: if u're broke, run gdkp
[4:54:42] Brockly1203: but if you do gdkps you wont be broke @SONII
[4:54:49] TobyNova: Can you explain the lore behind GDKP?
[4:54:50] drvichyssoise: @SONII can you link this
[4:54:51] Runekdabest: GDKP is fine gold buying is what's make it bad
[4:54:51] luzid7: it only works if everyone doing it
[4:54:58] iPlayCuzFun: jk tho, i just love the /roll
[4:55:00] TobyNova: Was there dragon's?
[4:55:05] mrhood71: i run them when im geared to get gold
[4:55:09] znowwwy: the only problem with GDKP's is the RMT part
[4:55:10] KonQel: You can always start a GDKP and dont roll on shit and earn gold, winkwink
[4:55:27] iPlayCuzFun: gdkp ruines the economy, it becomes useless to farm gold since buyin gold is sooo much more efficient
[4:55:29] CadaveriTV: i think GDKP systems IF and ONLY IF gold buying was not a thing or way more heavily enforced, but its rampant
[4:55:33] Harenzo: lol what a take
[4:55:33] TobyNova: wink
[4:56:02] Indomitablez: Yeah people did it
[4:56:04] Indomitablez: I did it
[4:56:43] ChuDy1457: wait guys.. what exactly is it? like personal loot system or ?
[4:56:45] kegness: Pay to play the game then pay to not play the ga me
[4:57:03] XaleEroomTV: Simple time is money
[4:57:04] Harenzo: buying wow gametime cards was one of the only ways some european countries could play wow as they weren't support by blizzard with card payment
[4:57:06] KonQel: i dont think it was at the time tho
[4:57:11] KonQel: back in the day
[4:57:16] buzz97: Same
[4:57:28] Runekdabest: Bro I literally bought game time cards for gold from the Chinese whole wotlk and cata wdym
[4:57:28] Cubanito06: so you dont like playing the game
[4:57:29] ims0mewhere: saving time
[4:57:36] KonQel: Yeah ofc it is, but when i work 8-10h a day i dont rly have time for the boring shit
[4:57:37] TobyNova: yupppp
[4:57:40] Cubanito06: i dont like working but i have to do it
[4:57:42] sweetleaf_: Sure but then why play?
[4:57:48] iPlayCuzFun: but it ruins it for eeeeeveeeryone else that dont wanna spend real money to play a agame..
[4:57:55] ims0mewhere: imagine vanilla consumes without buying gold way too much farming
[4:58:03] rawlexdota: Well its like, if theres a pill u can get that can get u fit equal to working out to 6 months , what do u chose
[4:58:06] doleod: Sonii is getting converted.  We’re gonna come in tomorrow his horde flag will be replaced by the Chinese flag.
[4:58:11] TobyNova: it is a part of the game though
[4:58:21] karrots96: @sweetleaf_ like mentioned in the post, they value enhancing their skill and improving technique in the game. Not wasting time "farming"
[4:58:22] drvichyssoise: @SONII Can you link this please
[4:58:27] KonQel: now i've had more time and actually have farmed alot of gold myself, i've only bought 200ish
[4:58:29] authoraborealis: too bad
[4:58:31] TobyNova: @doleod lmao
[4:58:33] hunthutchy: too bad
[4:58:34] shiftbbg: me
[4:58:38] lebrun_james_: power of the credit card
[4:58:43] iPlayCuzFun: so now we all gotta spend 50 bucks a month to buy gold...
[4:58:44] Thetoast08: ppl with no jobs saying too bad
[4:58:47] chalupacabras: It comes down to bot RMT causing something that costs 1g a stack, to be 10g+ a stack.
[4:59:02] spike82q: his intro music will now be the CCP   theme
[4:59:05] Cubanito06: sonii i dont have time to go to the gym so if i could just wake up and have abs and skip that monotonous "routine" and just have it that'd be great
[4:59:07] azzy_dog: lol
[4:59:08] Runekdabest: haha this is true y
[4:59:17] buzz97: @iplaycuzfun its botting that is making stuff expensive for everyone because of inflation, gold buying is only shifting around who has it
[4:59:34] iPlayCuzFun: did u see a flask if supreme power is like 750g on era servers...
[4:59:40] Indomitablez: What if blizzard released different servers, one with phases that moved slower than the other allowing casual players to be 'behind' on content compared to the other server giving them time to get the gear from the content before moving on... could be a completely stupid take
[4:59:52] iPlayCuzFun: @buzz97 if no one bought gold trust me there wouldnt be any bots
[4:59:57] Cubanito06: wtf
[5:00:01] KonQel: LUL
[5:00:26] TobyNova: @Indomitablez Could do, didn't they do this when TBC came out and people could stay on Vanilla? or something liek that
[5:00:35] buzz97: @iplaycuzfun I dont doubt that, still would want botting gone and not gold buying, I hate farming gold
[5:00:47] buzz97: Though I havent bought any yet in sod
[5:00:53] azzy_dog: WHAAAT?
[5:01:02] KonQel: kinda dystopian
[5:01:04] KonQel: LUL
[5:01:05] bubblesthebelfwarrior: if u bid 90 u should pay that for the next one
[5:01:06] TobyNova: wow
[5:01:10] bubblesthebelfwarrior: thats norm
[5:01:25] StandardOut: That seems logical but also.. no
[5:01:36] TobyNova: That is wild
[5:01:37] KonQel: Imagine being in that situation
[5:01:38] KonQel: hahahah

[5:02:04] bubblesthebelfwarrior: its common cause of things like teir tokens
[5:02:06] znowwwy: don't be a rib man and buy gold then ?
[5:02:09] djOrris: @sonii are the vods enabled I need to see your reaction again when watching that wow vid 😂😂😂
[5:02:09] KonQel: That should be your alt channels name
[5:02:11] bubblesthebelfwarrior: saves time from biding back up
[5:02:13] luzid7: no one is talking about they destroy the economy combinded with botts
[5:02:17] miciahclay: A lot of them do that, if there is two of the same, second goes at the pass price or starts at second highest bid at least
[5:02:24] wsnow_x: if they didnt, people would just bid others up so they make more gold in the gdkp
[5:02:28] TobyNova: Sonii can you read in 0.5 please?
[5:02:30] Ashlikesnows: LUL gold buyers
[5:02:32] sweetleaf_: I just think GDKP enjoyers and gold buyers see having a high gold value in game as winning. Just shallow gamers imo.

[5:03:27] Indomitablez: @nike_rise nah, they just dont have the servers anymore because blizzard couldnt come to an agreement on the server lease renewal
[5:03:27] wsnow_x: @nike_rise no, there servers were just shut down. they all play on the tiawan servers now
