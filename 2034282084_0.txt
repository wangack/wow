[0:20:16] animeintrovibes: you going to play fire in the awc? Kappa
[0:20:16] Holyxyz1: i run out of healing and pala presses 1 button to top people
[0:20:51] Holyxyz1: ye could be
[0:21:36] animeintrovibes: ive been practicing my arcane rotation a lot too, pretty fun when you can get it down better
[0:21:36] otacmilan57: Raiku did u use your emerald blossom dreamstone for infuzing gear ? if u did can u please show us what it looks like
[0:21:53] neskox: what healer do you think will dominate in cata?

[0:22:56] otacmilan57: u get that for 2.4k :D
[0:23:07] otacmilan57: for special effect on your armor
[0:23:10] buzuzuk1: what other melee can work with arcane besides rogue?
[0:23:16] madstepz: it gives the elite armor look for non elite set
[0:23:53] neskox: i saw a dk wearing a 483 gs ring in arena that somehow had much more stamina/offstats than his other 489 pvp ring. i really dont get it

[0:28:29] Skyle_win: yo what do you say about MLD with frost destro? seems almost better than frost demo... but i feel like its unplayable into ele teams, where i feel like as a mage you even want to go arcane... but thoughts?
[0:28:29] n0tDef1ned: ele?
[0:28:40] animeintrovibes: ele boomy is scary
[0:29:02] buzuzuk1: Is arms bad?

[0:30:11] elnordx: like 2 days ago
[0:30:16] kevinsorbo1337: were there any class changes?
[0:30:21] Joke_Fistweaver: imagine if frost mage got 20% ms on their chill effects again, would that fix the spec?
[0:30:23] Holyxyz1: @Tjaktv thats why the Kappa
[0:30:30] Tjaktv: @Holyxyz1 ik

[0:31:11] redapple333: priest need some love
[0:31:12] elnordx: what mage nerf
[0:31:17] elnordx: frost or arcane?
[0:31:18] Tjaktv: did they say anything about conqest boxes tomorrow or not
[0:31:24] Holyxyz1: priest needs jesus not some love
[0:31:33] Holyxyz1: @Tjaktv nope
[0:31:41] Tjaktv: priest is fine guys stop the kap
[0:31:41] animeintrovibes: what a bs change tbh
[0:31:45] Tjaktv: I see
[0:32:00] elnordx: actually not a really small one
[0:32:05] elnordx: its a mid nerf imo
[0:32:33] hollow1zed: tbh i understand the change, imagine if you didnt play sl and mage and lock randomly have one nature school spell
[0:33:36] Mimou_: how are they making class changes and not touch sp? do they think sp is fine or?>
[0:33:56] Skyle_win: hm yeah MLD felt pretty hopeless vs really good dh dk restodruid teams...
[0:33:56] Tjaktv: @Holyxyz1 if you plpayed sinister season you would be grateful for how priest is rn
[0:34:01] O6JIOM: so for pvp this patch is useless?
[0:34:18] oWcsgo: Do you still believe they will do some tunings like a little nerf for resto druid+SP buffs etc, or first after AWC?
[0:34:49] O6JIOM: Raiku do u know when wwill be infinity conquest time?
[0:34:52] tanguero: KonCha KonCha
[0:35:06] oWcsgo: Would have made such more sense to do it now 2 weeks till AWC time ti adapt instead of only 1 week.
[0:35:08] trixbunneh565: Raiku has Meh quit?
[0:35:08] Emiliiooz: maybe buff hpala Kappa
[0:35:14] RabbitCollector: enhance needs buffing
[0:35:15] tanguero: shadow priest Kappa
[0:35:26] ZeromakerLive: which spec is better for solo shuffle? like easier for a noob mage?
[0:35:42] kishoengi: )
[0:35:51] Skyle_win: what comp would you play if you can pick between rdruid/hpal; lock, mage, dh
[0:35:52] heymomimonttv: enh needs a rework in general. even ele could use some updating
[0:36:16] itsbelaruskyy: frost spec actualy?
[0:36:17] Skyle_win: ye thought so too ... ty
[0:36:39] animeintrovibes: what do you think about the tier sets that people are voting for for s4
[0:36:40] Skyle_win: frost is easier to play as mage for sure
[0:36:56] sapbender: thoughts about ultrabulls performance yday?
[0:37:14] buzuzuk1: What healer would you prefer for arcane/armsx ? Druid or pala?
[0:37:15] itsbelaruskyy: Is it relevant to play Frost solo?
[0:37:18] n0tDef1ned: @raikubest what are the things you consider when making a good comp, is it cc, survibability, dmg output, healing, synergy and if so what's the thought process
[0:37:39] animeintrovibes: yeah ik makes me sad

[0:37:56] animeintrovibes: l;ol
[0:38:53] Skyle_win: yeah s1 glacial oneshot stuff
[0:38:57] itsbelaruskyy: Is it possible to get a high rating in frost speck?
[0:39:10] Skyle_win: would you say sp lock rdruid is better than mld? i dont think so...
[0:39:18] elnordx: i missed deep freezee
[0:39:19] n0tDef1ned: mortal strike means what exactly? Healing off dps or? or like passive healing?
[0:39:31] ExoliaTV: ExoliaTV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:40:00] heymomimonttv: @n0tDef1ned it decreases healing done on the target
[0:40:13] tommymage: healing reduction debuff built into rotation @n0tDef1ned
[0:40:18] Sammie98: demo
[0:40:31] animeintrovibes: it would be really dope if for pvp you could just choose what tier set you wanted or like mix and match 2 pieces
[0:40:38] elnordx: so dont play two of those together elly/mage/boomy/sp
[0:40:44] astrry: all melee except for ret

[0:42:55] raqsyo: how is outlaw right now can i come back again ? ^^
[0:43:07] heymomimonttv: @raqsyo outlaw is great in pve and pvp
[0:43:07] tommymage: valid
[0:43:28] raqsyo: @heymomimonttv oi ty buddy :)
[0:43:58] n0tDef1ned: why do you think it's op? just cc rogue brings and dmg consistent or?

[0:44:22] heymomimonttv: sub is easier to play than outlaw, less buttons
[0:44:39] heymomimonttv: sub still extremely strong but outlaw just rips
[0:44:48] Nextrkw: the sub nerf was big too
[0:44:53] Nextrkw: cus before u were so close to living on dogshit goes
[0:44:55] iliketurkle: How Do i quit this game my life is in ruins

[0:45:46] tichoka: i just inted 3x sub shuffle 2-4, its c tier :)
[0:45:55] asdqwfsfgdxgdfh: duel should be removed from sub

[0:46:07] conman_tv: that head is fugly
[0:46:08] Blumee9: Did sub get nerfed again?
[0:46:21] napen: unless is whazz sub suckx haha
[0:46:33] animeintrovibes: i might try outlaw out, i love playing tanky classes
[0:46:37] itsbelaruskyy: For a mage who is the best to play ranking with in 2x2
[0:46:42] tichoka: Ppl say  remove duel because every rogue between 1.5-2.4 abuse duel
[0:46:50] tichoka: they just force trinket then fullcd in duel
[0:47:43] Blumee9: in 3s yes, but what about solo shuffle without duel
[0:48:01] animeintrovibes: sub just has so many outs
[0:48:28] Blumee9: I agree, but duel is what makes it even playable in solo cause people cant play with it imo
[0:48:36] elnordx: OH
[0:48:43] elnordx: finallly queue
[0:48:43] starving8: Raiku vs the Bull..
[0:48:49] quinnm27: i think the main people complaining about anything rog havent played a rogue and had a decent opponent play against u and make it hard

[0:56:11] Izostarx: maybe you get 3 wins cos lontar goes 6-0
[0:56:30] OptiTV_: maybe he's involuntarily letting lontar win after lontar helped him get glad last season?
[0:56:41] nokster: i dont think he's wintrading, met him a few times and hes just bad.
[0:56:54] ExoliaTV: @OptiTV_ casssAya casssAya
[0:57:04] animeintrovibes: playing vs mm hunter is so unfun
[0:57:44] OptiTV_: I just hate how Lontar can do this every day with his viewers lontarFLEX
[0:57:45] tichoka: I like how r1 streamers have zero things to say how others should improve so they dont troll their next game, instead they just say "u are bad, uninstall"
[0:58:32] Daicy: @tichoka who asked?
[0:58:35] Saphya_: @tichoka its not worth to tell ppl what to do after u lose with them ever bro, next round they play into you theyll do it and you lose another round
[0:58:46] animeintrovibes: nice
[0:58:56] blastoidzzz: yea its not their job to improve them tbh
[0:59:30] Saphya_: i mean it is nice to tell ppl what they do wrong, but they usually take that as an insult anyway xd

[1:09:20] AvocadoTS: I am kinda new to mage and i have tried all 3 specs. Honestly arcane seems like the weakest one. Am I wrong and its just me being bad? Or is this true, and people play arcane cuz its fun?
[1:09:53] Skyle_win: do you have any tips on how to play dh  (as destro dh rdruid)? sit on dd casters a lot and swap healers?
[1:10:44] Skyle_win: arcane is good, it s just awkward to play some lobbies (you get no dmg for the longest time but then you can oneshot) @ avocado
