[0:30:22] Gaming_Mama56: Good day Tali ! Hope your plumbing and ceiling issues are resolved.
[0:30:28] lonesomecowboy: did you get the real mario to come
[0:30:31] XedL: Awww - happy birthday Ani!
[0:30:32] caradosailanthus: Which Mario showed up?
[0:30:36] i_identify_as_a_mistake: is the light coming from the ceiling or the bald spot? ^_^
[0:30:36] lumaday: Was this the one with Super Marios Bros invites?
[0:30:36] Rico_Azzarash: 5yers sub with you smile xD
[0:30:41] RileyDoodles_: Happy Birthday Ani! :D
[0:30:44] Rico_Azzarash: Yes yes xD
[0:31:10] Rico_Azzarash: Woah!!!
[0:31:16] aerissune: Good job!
[0:31:26] Nimsh: tneKragwa
[0:31:39] netonkent: Is there any news haha
[0:32:24] Rico_Azzarash: So... you mean... if there will be any klind of higlights from Tali we need to put his distorted widened baldspot on the background? XDDD
[0:32:36] Sch1ey: And from the same voices
[0:32:46] lonesomecowboy: and ironically its the same dude complaining on both sides just a few years apart
[0:32:57] netonkent: Ff14 came to Xbox and loads of people can't even log in including me
[0:33:01] SinicalDev: Time is a cycle
[0:33:02] ver_flashbang: Theun and dorki saying there are too many defensives to cycle through is wild but I kinda get it.
[0:33:03] dwolf010: becouse they old now
[0:33:05] lumaday: There is so much content to discuss around WoW going into TWW
[0:33:17] XedL: Seems to be cyclical - they were complaining things were too easy in Wrath...
[0:33:28] schlakt: imo the game feels better than ever
[0:33:33] Gaming_Mama56: Wows too easy!! It's too complicated..blah blah
[0:33:38] link4lif3: The last time we had a real purge was legion going into BFA, most abilities we've lost over BFA and Shadowlands are in some sort of talent form, so I feel like this is the first time in a few years we're getting new (besides reworks)
[0:34:10] SquiggySquonk: It’s too difficultly easy.
[0:34:17] lonesomecowboy: wasn't a huge part of the classic andy argument that theyve dumbed the game down too much?
[0:34:35] ghuuny: ghuuny subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[0:34:36] link4lif3: There was similar discourse iirc about MoP abilities
[0:34:37] Vaephera: I feel like optimising your rotation is as complicated as its ever been, although it is spec dependent. Getting 80-90% out of it is probably a bit easier than in the past, though
[0:34:47] ver_flashbang: The ceiling has become higher but the floor also lower over the last few years.
[0:34:56] Sch1ey: Remember when retail players were going to be able to handle classic in 2019
[0:35:03] Sch1ey: Weren't
[0:35:03] Gaming_Mama56: He doesn't even play
[0:35:18] Atomicpanda: we're getting older
[0:35:32] bettys_dungeon_adventures: i think those loud voices are just never happy and they fit their narrative to suit whatever new thing or change they dont like they want to harp on
[0:35:49] Sch1ey: I love that asmons community is praising last epoch and poe for its complexity while hating wow for it
[0:36:10] link4lif3: we're not using wow to escape our school lives, now we need it to escape Real Real life
[0:36:16] XedL: That's a mighty fine vessel
[0:36:17] bladestitch: Stopped playing for a couple a years while I was studying at university.
[0:36:24] ver_flashbang: The whole discussion revolves largely around mythic+ which I think is fair to say has evolved to be way more complicated compared to what Legion M+ was.
[0:36:27] Gaming_Mama56: Us older players  just hate relearning systems every patch
[0:36:30] aerissune: <3
[0:36:36] Atomicpanda: i feel like every single system in the game is overcomplicated. but i'm also now over 50, so i don't know if it's the game or me.
[0:36:40] Rico_Azzarash: AHhhh!!!! Now I can rest in piece!!!
[0:36:49] sirhc_knil: Hi Tali - what are the plans for today?
[0:36:54] ver_flashbang: Like Legion trash pack mechanics in m+ vs current is night and day
[0:37:06] grimblymcgoo: @Gaming_Mama56 not so much
[0:37:11] link4lif3: Dont forget we're getting evergreen systems, so we may not have to relearn from here on possibly
[0:37:18] Travnar: Rotation and returning players getting completely lost on what to do IMO
[0:37:40] RosieSeren: I find it much harder going back to older content, I feel most 'systems' in game that are current you can jump into quite quickly
[0:37:48] LordFaunty: I'd love a simpler Arcane spec
[0:37:52] lumaday: The dependency on Addons is real
[0:37:55] bettys_dungeon_adventures: there are specs you can play that have like 5 buttons (demon hunter for example)
[0:38:14] hitchmeister59: He actually talks about how easy WoW is.
[0:38:16] AtomJar: Its crazy all this talk is coming from hero talents considering there passives mostly
[0:38:17] einomar: If you simplify the rotations you have to make it more action based to make it engaging.  Which I'm not sure wow players in general want.
[0:38:20] JD_Rieku: Addons are fine but needing 100X WAS to do mythic raid is a joke
[0:38:25] nocterequiem: i mean for high end gameplay you need addons nowadays
[0:38:29] knightjudicator: i love addons but they ARE too required for higher content
[0:38:30] AssumptionPrime: oh, I find the currencies and progression and story order confusing, but rotations and stuff feel fine (recently returning player)
[0:38:30] schlakt: if wow is reset, he Will just find something new to complain about
[0:38:30] diyreality: But there is nothing new as old player? Mechanics are just a remix, rotations doesnt matter unless you do mraiding/+25s week 2
[0:38:32] aerissune: I'd never find anything without coordinates 😆
[0:38:35] michaelmm: I'd not want to give up addons, but at the same time I think they should not be a required as they are currently.
[0:38:38] ver_flashbang: There are some really disgusting weak auras like one that screams at you to throw up a defensive due to getting targeted from 2 mobs with something not interruptible.
[0:38:39] Rico_Azzarash: NO! I need those addons, so everyone will die when they see the size of my HP bar!!!!!!
[0:38:45] hitchmeister59: But to be fair he doesn't play when he logs in, he just gets carried by his army of fans.
[0:38:48] SinicalDev: Asmon doesn't exactly have much conviction in his views, he flip flops constantly
[0:38:49] Gaming_Mama56: Most of the add-ons should by now be baked in the base game.
[0:38:53] lonesomecowboy: the war on addons feels like such a 1 dimensional take like yeah theres some spaceship weakauras that are weird but like i have very few addons and do just fine in the kind of content i like to do lol
[0:38:57] RosieSeren: I've stopped using addons, with the new UI and bag options, I don't think you need them, but if you have ones that make it fun for you then whats the big deal
[0:38:58] targus92dd: Addon is a joke in arena tho, best ui wins
[0:39:00] gryffiest: any tips for a beginner disc priest?
[0:39:05] chryseis: I've never understood why people care about the way other people choose to play the game
[0:39:11] Vaephera: They tried with private auras, then people figured out they could get around it by having macros to hit to trigger the WAs, rather than it being automatic
[0:39:15] grimblymcgoo: Asmon has never put effort into retail. He gets carried through the content week one then bitches that its lame and theres nothing to do.
[0:39:30] Rico_Azzarash: @gryffiest find a guild that will allow you to stay DC priest no matter what
[0:39:34] KyleS07: Order of operations for a rotation matters. to optimize dps you have to do it in the right order at the right time. some of the if thens are complicated and hard to manage. ff14 combat is easier and in some ways better.
[0:39:50] bottis96: agree
[0:40:03] ver_flashbang: That's true a well, "look at how cluttered drjay or dorkis UI is" yeah but do you do 30+ keys?
[0:40:08] caradosailanthus: I dislike the healer UI non populating npcs
[0:40:18] bogatykrzysiu: world first race should be on tournament realm, with buffs to bosses just for them
[0:40:19] caradosailanthus: It's just choosing gamestyle winners
[0:40:22] Gaming_Mama56: Agreed  KyleS07
[0:40:27] targus92dd: You should never based things of world first. They are 0,1% of wow
[0:40:32] bogatykrzysiu: balancing raids just for 0.0001% of players is kinda dumb
[0:40:48] bladestitch: I follow a youtuber that started playing wow from scratch. He had a ton of fun just running around and figur thing out himself.
[0:40:52] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel i hope you did it in incognito and not logged in... otherwise rip your algo
[0:41:01] kaijoe_: Reset WoW is gonna be the new buzz phrase for the next couple months, isn't it?
[0:41:03] ver_flashbang: Because he takes his perspective from 0,1% players lol.
[0:41:04] diyreality: Only relatively new players think you need all of the add-ons all of the time. You only need like 1-2 add-ons for raiding
[0:41:08] lumaday: @bladestitch j1mmy video?
[0:41:10] XedL: #noaddons is the new #nochanges
[0:41:12] nocterequiem: removing add ons will never happen
[0:41:12] KyleS07: I’m only against dps and boss helper addons.
[0:41:16] heatforge: If you don't want addons don't use them?
[0:41:22] AssumptionPrime: I think saying those things only affect world first groups overlooks the other half of Dan's video: how much world first strats and methods trickle down to even PUG groups
[0:41:39] bogatykrzysiu: but yu are expected to use them
[0:41:41] knightjudicator: @heatforge you can get kicked for not having them.....
[0:41:45] bogatykrzysiu: by other people
[0:41:49] Gaming_Mama56: Raids should be tuned to heroic raiders atmost
[0:41:51] targus92dd: @kaijoe_ i dont get the reset thing, we have seasons
[0:42:02] knightjudicator: @AssumptionPrime this
[0:42:12] wanik90: it’s frustrating how many people will just uncritically regurgitate asmon’s opinions when they probably hadn’t even had those thoughts themselves before.
[0:42:13] nocterequiem: theres been an arms race in mythic raiding for a long time yea, i.e. private auras
[0:42:23] XedL: It can filter into other areas of gameplay - the auction traders having something as powerful as TSM gives an enormous leg up on the standard AH even after changes
[0:42:25] magemaster225: I dont think the fights in season of discovery require weakauras and they seem to be making those players happy
[0:42:30] heatforge: @knightjudicator wild to hear. I have a guild I run with so I don't get the full picture I suppose.
[0:42:46] Merex760: I think if a game has to be balanced around the assumption people are using certain addons, those addons are too powerful
[0:42:46] kaijoe_: @targus92dd Exactly. Resetting is never ever gonna happen. And it's just lazy criticism
[0:42:49] AssumptionPrime: fair enough, misunderstood what you were saying there
[0:42:57] RehRehh: is streaming harder than a real job?
[0:43:16] ver_flashbang: They use those addons mostly for consistency sake as well (raiding 12+ hours a day is tiring lol) not because they absolutely need them.
[0:43:17] Trebled_Mind: yay! you’re live! love starting my mornings this way.
[0:43:40] RehRehh: but but hassan says so it must be true
[0:43:51] Gaming_Mama56: It is a real job if you make money
[0:44:21] cabeshpash: what kind of mental health problems?
[0:44:30] Kneckt: @plopsmurf stop it LUL
[0:44:31] kaijoe_: lol @ putting "mental health" in quotes
[0:44:35] grimblymcgoo: @plopsmurf Im sure youve been heard of before this very moment...
[0:44:40] knightjudicator: @plopsmurf having to put on a performance of yourself for X hours a day is hard period
[0:44:43] bogatykrzysiu: xd
[0:44:44] lil_doreo: oof
[0:44:47] Gh0stBadger: a miner?
[0:44:48] Merex760: @plopsmurf Now that's about as ignorant as saying steaming is harder than a normal job lol
[0:44:48] bogatykrzysiu: hot take
[0:44:51] Gh0stBadger: coal miner?
[0:44:54] bottis96: My son wanted to play wow i'm having him play SOD first before Retail to learn the game better
[0:44:54] Trebled_Mind: tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini
[0:44:54] netonkent: I lift stones all day and I would choose that than having Hassan stress, though I'd like his money haha
[0:44:56] Reminii91: is it the streaming is hard hot topic, today Tali?
[0:44:58] WoWPoko: lmaooo
[0:45:01] Trebled_Mind: tneTrundleMaldini
[0:45:04] SinicalDev: Nobody is immune from mental health issues
[0:45:07] ver_flashbang: @plopsmurf how can you get baited this easily.
[0:45:09] RosieSeren: even the nicest jobs can see have their stresses, also streamers have lives outside of their job as well, like all people do
[0:45:12] RehRehh: I think streaming is easy bc anybody can boot up a live stream. But i think its harder to actually make a living out of it
[0:45:13] Ulatempa86: You normaly don't have to be as good at your job with a normal job, if you want to make a living.
[0:45:14] Metket: KEKG
[0:45:20] Kneckt: I work a shitty 9x5 at a social media platform and I'd rather do this than all the shit u have to keep up with @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:45:21] SinicalDev: @SinicalDev Even the jailer
[0:45:21] Deatheran: god i LOVE that people clipped like 1/2 a sentence from one streamer and it spawned this huge hate debate. streaming a real job just like any other job.
[0:45:21] bladestitch: Mental health is so important and I have an intense dislike to anyone that minimize it...
[0:45:26] knightjudicator: @bottis96 that seems very backwards tbh
[0:45:35] lonesomecowboy: yeah I mean Hasan didn't even really say it was harder he just said that the social battery requirements are kind of insane compared to other jobs which i believe
[0:45:39] vlaovich88: tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini
[0:45:39] einomar: Plopsmurf is a professional troller
[0:45:45] Gh0stBadger: lol what a dumbass
[0:45:51] iamdrewonline: i have mental isssues i watch this show:)
[0:45:56] Bitfrost9: i would've loved to be able to block people from my old retail job.
[0:46:04] Trebled_Mind: Even if he was a professional streamer. He has no business invalidating other streamer experiences.
[0:46:07] hyzenthlays: saw this guy asking stupid questions in chat the last few streams
[0:46:08] KyleS07: Content creation has its own challenges. many still need to have meetings and planning boards and agents/managers. it’s like a normal job.
[0:46:08] bigoldmeatpie: man that person really teed up the ban perfectly. that was beautiful
[0:46:09] XedL: Great demonstration there of part of the streaming job :D
[0:46:13] Softex: saying streaming isnt difficult, while being the reason it can be difficult
[0:46:13] RosieSeren: imagine being able to block people in customer service
[0:46:18] reggiepowa: when is real life blocking like in that black mirror episode going to become a thing
[0:46:20] Arlaeya: if people come into your house and take a shit on the floor.... yeah, kick them out
[0:46:22] bittebatt: I love you guys! <3 I am here to spread the love, one good comment at a time. To balance out the shitters! <3
[0:46:22] Deatheran: i wish LSF never existed man
[0:46:25] bogatykrzysiu: some people just need to realize that you need to cut off toxic people from your life, no matter who they are to them
[0:46:31] ver_flashbang: It's not even about content creation, being self-employed is always stressful
[0:46:31] knightjudicator: @lonesomecowboy it's like the same level as acting/performing
[0:46:33] Rico_Azzarash: Block me! So I will be only able to text messages with gift-sub-mourze-code xDDDD
[0:46:38] sirhc_knil: What are your plans for today? WQ? M+?
[0:46:39] Reminii91: oh you'd love asmon stream this morning... 2h45mn of arguing with chat
[0:46:39] WoWPoko: As a streamer, you also have the right to refuse service
[0:46:41] RehRehh: you should shadow ban them so that they thik they are typing  but nobody can see their comments bahhaha
[0:46:47] SancerTheDeathKnight: Kragwa
[0:46:51] netonkent: I lift stones all day and I would choose that than having Hassan stress, though I'd like his money haha
[0:47:05] chryseis: Every job has its difficulties
[0:47:15] RehRehh: I think its "harder" to make money out of streaming
[0:47:26] vlaovich88: It is difficult to be successful. It is difficult to play a character all the time. I couldn't do it personally
[0:47:28] Gaming_Mama56: It's like being a live stage actor on live tv
[0:47:32] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel people in this argument will probably also say coding or research scientist is not a "real" job compared to a blue collar job
[0:47:35] XedL: I don't think I could do it - having a game open, camera on and an open mic to the _internet_ would have me in a cold sweat immediately
[0:47:37] KyleS07: I’d love to be a content creator, but I’m not sure I could do it. I know people who stream irl and they get just as stressed as I do.
[0:47:47] Kneckt: i couldn't ever enjoy games if i streamed
[0:47:52] Gaming_Mama56: Lol
[0:47:54] RosieSeren: also I find the 'money doesn't buy happiness' a bit patronising, its true but at least you don't have to worry about bills, food and somewhere to live
[0:48:03] Trebled_Mind: as a musician I 100% agree.
[0:48:05] bottis96: Retail kinda forces you along to fast he wanted to play the original areas with people
[0:48:12] XedL: Improv busking?
[0:48:17] Chrizkit: Hello! Yes it's a business
[0:48:21] Deatheran: @RosieSeren money does not buy "happyness" but i damn well does buy peace of mind
[0:48:22] Arlaeya: busking with 200 other buskers on the same corner playing at different volumes fighting for an audience
[0:48:26] aeson_of_raid_sock: aeson_of_raid_sock subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 33 months! here’s some coin in your hat professional busker
[0:48:31] Gaming_Mama56: Good analogy
[0:48:32] aerissune: Must buy food
[0:48:42] gryffiest: random q - will chromie time increase to 70 at prepatch or official release of TWW?
[0:48:47] Reminii91: busking?
[0:48:54] KyleS07: @kneckt I thought that about working on/with computers, but I found I still really enjoy it now that I do it professionally.
[0:49:02] netonkent: Hassans streams are just him getting attacked the whole time
[0:49:04] knightjudicator: street performing
[0:49:09] ver_flashbang: PETAAAAAH
[0:49:16] Softex: "busking" just makes me think of rusk...
[0:49:16] Gaming_Mama56: "Toss a coin to your streamer"
[0:49:17] knightjudicator: @Reminii91 street performing
[0:49:19] MichaelXIII: MichaelXIII subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 59 months! 
[0:49:24] RosieSeren: I'm currently struggling to make ends meet but when things improve I can't wait to gift you some subs
[0:49:25] Rico_Azzarash: lmao what? REALLY? XDD
[0:49:45] gabhion: Hi Taliesin, may I ask what is your thoughts on blizzard's move (long ago) from a dps rotation to a build-spend rotation combat style (such as the introduction of Holy power / Insanity)?
[0:49:46] saarkhastick: @Reminii91 Street corner performing with a hat out for people to drop money in. In short anyway, that's what it is.
[0:49:47] ver_flashbang: You have insane chat participation for 300-400 ppl.
[0:49:52] diyreality: thank you sir, we are awesome , our day is complete
[0:49:58] Gaming_Mama56: We love both of you too
[0:50:29] Reminii91: oh, never heard of this term before.
[0:50:30] Metket: @TaliesinAndEvitel are we gonna hear something about 10.2.6 this week?
[0:50:35] bogatykrzysiu: streaming is stressful job bcs you can "lose" it in seconds, just by getting cancelled or platform getting shut down
[0:50:39] RehRehh: 10 MORE MONTHS
[0:50:47] RehRehh: 10 MORE MONTHS DUDE
[0:50:54] bogatykrzysiu: like when the microsoft platform got shut down
[0:51:14] XedL: Quick, pivot to Helldivers!
[0:51:17] ver_flashbang: All self-employed jobs are stressful in the first place until you "really made it"
[0:51:37] Kortinas: Iv been trying to stream, its been interesting with just two people. I am unsure how you are able to keep up with all of us. I wish I could do more to support you (besides amazon prime)
[0:51:38] KatieRet_: America is criminal
[0:51:42] XedL: Oh man, the things you could do with the Media Literacy side of that XD
[0:51:50] bladestitch: Freelance artist seems like a though job since so many abuse new artists for freebies.
[0:52:05] Reminii91: hell yea, have you been spreading "managed democracy" recently, Tali?
[0:52:24] Xzibitdude: @taliesinandevitel Wanted to ask you, what do you think about Wow's real big bad? The one that'd make even void scream - Ouroboros?
[0:52:28] Chrizkit: it's like any other start-up business such as food trucks..it takes time to build it up
[0:52:49] XedL: Helldivers has sent the 97 Starship Troopers movie up the charts
[0:52:52] Reminii91: just watch the short intro to Hell Divers 2, tali
[0:52:53] RehRehh: How about your vigilante life? Is saving Hells Kitchen harder than a real job? Especially wearing a red spandex suit must be hot in there while you jump around
[0:52:54] AssumptionPrime: Managed Democracy is Helldivers stuff
[0:52:57] knightjudicator: does the availability of the NHS make self-employment in the UK slightly easier? it's hell here in the US trying to get affordable pricing via self-employment
[0:53:00] Chrizkit: yes
[0:53:25] kaijoe_: Oh it's total satire
[0:53:26] Softex: "spreading democracy" as in shooting^^
[0:53:29] Saiyori: this is why tyranids are the best
[0:53:29] XedL: Yeeeeeeeep!
[0:53:30] Deatheran: i got a good laugh at the discource of "get the woke out of my helldivers" do people not get its parody?
[0:53:32] revan4686: it’s sick
[0:53:35] cosmopanda13: people have been arguing over starship troopers for the whole week now
[0:53:36] AssumptionPrime: yeah, it's absurd that people can misinterpret Helldivers, but they totally do
[0:53:36] Vaephera: There's a few people that don't get that it's satire but you have to try very hard with helldivers
[0:53:37] Kortinas: Ooof
[0:53:39] Nulgar: Democracy is from Helldivers , think Starship Troopers
[0:53:47] mxfelwinter: that's because they were first exposed to it when they were 10 years old, tali
[0:53:51] ver_flashbang: 40k: "what if we took the 3rd reich and turn it to 11" lol
[0:53:59] einomar: Oh yeah the empire of man is ultra fascist
[0:54:04] Saiyori: yeah....theres those at my lgs
[0:54:11] Atomicpanda: like the people who really love the empire in star wars.
[0:54:15] lil_doreo: i think it's a little better bcus openly based on Startship Trooper, but i probably don't read the fash- takes
[0:54:16] Bitfrost9: i think it's hard for many people to separate satire from reality because of how satirical real politics can be.
[0:54:23] sirhc_knil: What are your plans for stream today? Your WOW-To-do-list?
[0:54:26] RehRehh: mizkifMarch
[0:54:56] AvrithSATX: The Empire is clearly evil... but in a fun kind of way.
[0:54:57] hitchmeister59: The Starship Troopers movie.
[0:55:08] RehRehh: Have they added Guild Halls yet?
[0:55:08] Metket: @TaliesinAndEvitel are we gonna hear something about 10.2.6 this week? 󠀀
[0:55:12] bittebatt: I just think of Brad Pitt saying "Nazi" in Inglorious Bastards :D
[0:55:14] KatieRet_: i have a 22 rise if you're interested!
[0:56:07] Gaming_Mama56: When I was in sixth grade I donned us kids how bad the empire inSW was when a student got kicked out for two weeks for wearing an imperial officers cap
[0:56:22] RehRehh: Player housing next patch?
[0:56:27] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel totally the you look into the empire the worse they come off. but they look cool
[0:56:33] Nulgar: People who played WH as kids had rich parents
[0:56:33] AssumptionPrime: Oh, you think we'll hear about it. Would you... BET on that?
[0:56:37] Sharktribe: Hearthstone anniversary, at least on the Hearthstone app's reckoning, starts tomorrow. So probably 10.6 should be happening after
[0:56:45] Saiyori: TYRANIDS FOR LIFE
[0:56:45] KyleS07: Orks are objectively good
[0:56:55] Saiyori: I do love orks
[0:56:59] Metket: "pirates"
[0:57:03] Gaming_Mama56: The school thought it was an SS cap
[0:57:11] mxfelwinter: i will say, the first time i watched starship troopers (i was 11 years old), i didnt noticed it was satire, and i didnt liked it how fascist it was (before i even knew what was fascism), then i watched it as an adult and noticed it was satires and liked it
[0:57:19] netonkent: Kinder like the wow cosmic forces
[0:57:26] Deatheran: i'm 1000% a zerg / tyranid boy i want to be a bug and om nom nom the universe
[0:57:40] dragondognein: in Star Wars the Empire is based on America and the Rebels are Viet Kong
[0:57:51] ver_flashbang: @Deatheran With serral as your commander LuL
[0:57:56] diyreality: the real question is , will we get bunny ears in the trading post
[0:57:57] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel the fact blizz did not add a Rune in SOD to make a warriors actually able to dps from range using a gun, is sadge.
[0:58:02] Trebled_Mind: the bet was Evi was in whether we’ll see the Hearthstone Tavern in game
[0:58:10] Trebled_Mind: with*
[0:58:15] cosmopanda13: does it keeping secret working for people hype wise because it definitely doesn't for me
[0:58:15] reggiepowa: 8 weeks from 10.2.5 launch should be march 12th
[0:58:20] xd_pad: do you think we will get an expansion meta like Veilstrider in Shadowlands?
[0:58:21] FelPlague: I want a Star Wars style Bounty Hunter Warrior Rune.
[0:58:22] bladestitch: What about the conquistadors?
[0:58:23] Metket: if you look at roadmap heathstone is in 10.2.5 colunm so my bet is after that event Kappa
[0:58:26] bigoldmeatpie: my guess is 2nd week of march for 10.2.6 and 3rd week for alpha
[0:58:26] Garysteel1984: I'm around if you're needing a tank for some M+ tneTayto
[0:58:27] aeson_of_raid_sock: I liked Denise richards
[0:58:41] Reminii91: same, i was just kid enjoying space troopers shooting bugs. those references went over my head
[0:58:47] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel i have a vague memory of a starship troopers cartoon when i was a kid. but i dont remember one thing about it.
[0:58:49] Saiyori: Veisltrider was so hard to get but it's such a cool title
[0:59:20] Zaelsus: Yeah there was
[0:59:21] Theorof: Tali what was the name of the dragon riding addon that you were recommending a couple months ago?
[0:59:26] Sharktribe: @Deatheran maybe EXO squad or something?
[0:59:27] Atomicpanda: i think there were toys?
[0:59:28] magemaster225: there was a bad reboot/beast wars style cg one
[0:59:29] Zaelsus: Rico's Roughnecks or something along the lines of it
[0:59:40] DarthTaz0: There was a Robocop cartoon. And toys
[0:59:45] Nulgar: So, there's no PTR, but could there be a preview ahead of the patch?
[0:59:45] Garysteel1984: I preferred Super Troopers movie SeemsGood
[0:59:49] mxfelwinter: there was a starship troopers cgi cartoon, but they removed the fascism
[0:59:56] Dazzaw17: i remember an animated show called ricos roughnecks
[1:00:04] Softex: the quest timeline is too complicated e.e
[1:00:06] lumaday: So many versions for ppl to choose from now
[1:00:14] ver_flashbang: With classic getting "continued" now it doesn't make sense to change retail anyways.
[1:00:18] Aelissia: Only thing I want is better quest structure/clarity for new players/returners
[1:00:18] TankenFunk: WoW has a little too much going on at the moment, but that is also cause I do not want to invest as much time as I did before, so I play super casually. Not the game's fault
[1:00:29] iamdrewonline: details and DBM are not hard to learn
[1:00:29] QQGamers: even to new players?
[1:00:33] Metket: pvp is %100 unfriendly
[1:00:34] Lacee666: more like a bit bloated with all the modifiers, buffs that can affect your abilities
[1:00:38] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel i think anything above 2500 m+ is like top 20 to 10% of players your a gamer sir
[1:00:54] cabeshpash: @Softex yup the questing needs work, renown locking story quests is really annoying to me
[1:01:05] xd_pad: Superbloom is for new players
[1:01:13] ver_flashbang: What's funny is that Asmongold is a super huge PoE fan, which is crazy complicated and deep.
[1:01:18] Wretcluse: I don't think a +2 is too complicated for a new player.
[1:01:33] knightjudicator: i've made a point to only play overworld, lfr, and heroic dungeons this expac. most classes don't feel too complicated, even if i wish some had less buttons
[1:01:37] hitchmeister59: What about the "Raid Ready Boost?"
[1:01:38] Xzibitdude: What do you think about Ouroboros?
[1:01:54] lumaday: Tali did you watch the J1mmy youtube video about playing WoW as a new player?
[1:01:55] RileyDoodles_: @Wretcluse idk +2 can be too complicated for some old players :')
[1:01:58] iamdrewonline: youi have 70 levels to learn your class
[1:02:00] bottis96: do you think if they forced proximity voice chat to communicate  it would just be to toxic. seems like lack of communication makes it hard
[1:02:11] ver_flashbang: It's paced too fast but not complicated.
[1:02:24] iamdrewonline: agree
[1:02:30] RileyDoodles_: i think forced voice chat might be better, more accountability than text
[1:02:31] BaneOfTheFallenKing: as far as the new char exp goes, I wouldn't say it's hard, I do think it's overwhelming
[1:02:35] Bitfrost9: i think it's also that old leveling system felt more of an investment with how long it was.
[1:02:36] link4lif3: I liked his video style but i feel like he didnt put in enough hours to get a sense of the game
[1:03:03] lumaday: I thought about the curator bit a lot as he was going through retail
[1:03:28] gryffiest: do you think (or know) if chromie time will be changed to 70 at prepatch or at official launch of the War Within?
[1:03:32] RileyDoodles_: hard agree, it feels like a reward
[1:04:08] Merex760: Yeah dropping people into BFA or a newer expansion is weird. I get that it's more "modern" but they aren't made for new players
[1:04:09] Nulgar: @cabeshpash tbh it's unlocked naturally during the patch, but made worse because some grinded it in the first days, but long-term it should be nerfed - but rather in a soft way, like catchups, e.g. Unlocking Word of a Worthy Ally for everyone
[1:04:17] knightjudicator: i'm so excited for Exile's Reach to make sense with DF being leveling
[1:04:24] lumaday: Exiles reach probably really nice for for returning players
[1:04:41] caradosailanthus: Can't you just choose not to do Exile's Reach?
[1:04:54] ver_flashbang: I think exiles reach is almost too fast for new players.
[1:04:57] caradosailanthus: Oh my
[1:05:03] KyleS07: yeah the old starting zones are infinitely better. the stories are better too.
[1:05:22] Metket: force ppl to do shadowlands Despair
[1:05:27] RileyDoodles_: its such a shame, having the race specific starting zone is so important
[1:05:28] Dazzaw17: i always found runes confusing on DKs, never got on with that class at all
[1:05:29] Merex760: Rather than doing Exile's Reach, I wish they would've just updated Elwynn, etc.
[1:05:31] zebercetanayurt: yuppp
[1:05:33] sScottyKarate: Its the hand holding that game companies think we all need.
[1:05:35] Nulgar: Weren't the old starters unlocked again? Or was that just Chromie Time?
[1:05:52] diyreality: this reminds me of shadowlands launch, i waited 50minutes to log on, i went to bastion as first zone, there was maybe 3-4 people on launch day, sometimes shards be making the game sad
[1:05:57] KyleS07: if you’re new you can’t access the old starting zones.
[1:05:57] Reminii91: do you think they should create more versions of exile reach? perhaps diff scenario, locale, etc?
[1:06:02] Atomicpanda: i think it's too complicated for old players
[1:06:19] Wretcluse: you're right you do.
[1:06:19] zebercetanayurt: correct
[1:06:36] Saevash: Saevash subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Exiles reach is a mix bag... it's a great way to reach lvl 10 but it removes the wonder of exploring the world from the get go
[1:06:39] caradosailanthus: I've only had one account for 19 years, so also never start an account during the Exile's Reach era
[1:06:48] XedL: Opening your bags after a year or two away? Ooooof
[1:06:51] Merex760: Do you think ability bloat with the new talent trees is an issue @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:06:58] Dazzaw17: I have a friend who played classic, tried retail, saw all the quests in valdrakken and went straight back to classic
[1:07:11] Atomicpanda: that's what i mean. the systems are just so much
[1:07:12] McScooterson: Even on my alts the !'s are overwhelming
[1:07:22] aerissune: That is true, I have two middle schoolers who started and had to exiles reach.  The pop up comments helped them, but the story and world is not as robust.
[1:07:24] ver_flashbang: @Merex760 This is really class dependent
[1:07:30] CeasiusPls: I've tried to recruit some friends to play it for the first time. I personally feel there's no hook to get them to buy the game. They all stop playing at level 20
[1:07:31] Deatheran: brewmaster is the only spec that should be talking about button bloat
[1:07:34] Softex: and you cant even do certain story quests for context, because of the rep gate
[1:07:36] Wretcluse: rather than info pop-ups all over the UI... I would love to see some sort of clever beginners quest line.
[1:07:48] Durwen: I am so preparing the bottle of booze
[1:07:57] xd_pad: Most of the players I have had to explain the work order system to have been returning players
[1:08:00] hectorian01: 100% cosmetic
[1:08:04] Fibnkak: hey where is that guy that told me hello diver 2 online play wasn’t going to become toxic ?
[1:08:05] knightjudicator: THANK YOU TALI THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BE HORIZONTAL
[1:08:09] lumaday: I'm not thilled for more talents
[1:08:26] Bitfrost9: agreed on hero talents. i felt the same way too when they were announced.
[1:08:49] CeasiusPls: The original 'The war within is already dead' video Kappa
[1:09:09] KyleS07: 100% agree! hero talents should be cosmetic. I want to feel/look like a Templar. I don’t want more abilities.
[1:09:19] AtomJar: I mean i like the idea of my class changing every xpac in some way a new abilty or something. Would hate the idea of classes staying the same for multiple xpacs
[1:09:24] mxfelwinter: hero talent should be able to expand your choice of "class fantasy" first, than just stuff like "add 15% crit damage to x"
[1:09:33] Nulgar: It's weird that this only blew up so late, it's definitely because some  big streamer talked about it
[1:09:35] cabeshpash: I wouldn't mind new abilities if they were passives, or replaced existing abilities
[1:09:42] hectorian01: this should've been class skins but oh well here we are
[1:09:43] andr4ws: I honestly like the gameplay influence. There has to be some gameplay upgrade when going 10 more levels, adding another talent row doesn't really work well
[1:09:46] bladestitch: Aren't all streamers doomers at on point or other?
[1:10:10] Metket: LUL
[1:10:10] bladestitch: lol
[1:10:13] CrossroadsDealer: lol
[1:10:14] SciasWolf: Boom!
[1:10:15] witchhobbit: sairaLUL
[1:10:16] CeasiusPls: I've tried to recruit some friends to play it for the first time. I personally feel there's no hook to get them to buy the game. They all stop playing at level 20
[1:10:16] HeyheyReirei: they should turn hero talents into a small 4-talent thing. the frostbite mage tree has that cosmetic flavor but it’s still too much.
[1:10:17] Zaelsus: Tali is a Prophetic Doomer LUL
[1:10:18] ArkyteCurse: There's also some definition as well. "Not what you want them to be" and "terrible altogether" are two different things, but a lot of people conflate them
[1:10:20] QQGamers: thatst the same thing asmon says lmao
[1:10:24] Softex: correct and handsome
[1:10:25] Reminii91: lol clipped
[1:10:26] Aelissia: I agree actually... cosmetic would be nice. There's already a ton of talents to pick from, no mooore
[1:10:35] NotIeni: I feel like im the only one who is kinda happy with the talents, tho id love class skins too
[1:10:36] Fibnkak: wait how did this go from alpha to omg the sky is falling. I’ve been gone a month
[1:10:40] ghuuny: hero talents are again systems on top of systems....
[1:10:41] schlakt: Asmon stans are going to clip that
[1:10:41] hectorian01: do you think they will give up/ postpone them???
[1:11:01] Nulgar: I'd like if you were right on positive things more, e.g. Covenant Allied Races....
[1:11:07] FelPlague: felplaHere felplaHere felplaHere felplaHere felplaHere felplaHere felplaHere
[1:11:09] CrossroadsDealer: hero talents should be cosmetic flavors to enhance your characters fun. the design so far will just be another single best choice that you get dragged for not following.
[1:11:23] Dazzaw17: good, im all out of binds on my shaman now
[1:11:27] saarkhastick: I want to go Pack Leader and I want that to mean that I can do more with my pets, have more interaction with my pets and have more talents that utilize my pets. I don't want to just "look like" a Pack Leader, whatever that would look like. Note: I'm a permanoob, casual playing BM For Life hunter lol
[1:11:29] hectorian01: @Nulgar same?! I hate the new allied race... is so boring
[1:11:37] ver_flashbang: Many specs feel "complete" already with enough going on, hero talents adding another layer to that might be too much.
[1:11:42] Sch1ey: They do it to a few but its like adding am effect to ice block
[1:11:44] Metket: @TaliesinAndEvitel so we watched your oracle priest interview, did you like that?
[1:11:45] Sch1ey: Or feather
[1:11:47] cabeshpash: that sounds cool to me, they should do cosmetics in addition to that
[1:11:47] Fibnkak: oh good so only buff what ever is meta for ele shaman at the moment.
[1:11:53] hitchmeister59: You have to remember that Asmon is a character. He says whatever gets engagement. That includes hate.
[1:12:04] dwolf010: I do want class altering stuff in a new expansion but also want class skins. and i think blizzard want as well and results in this. dont think they have enough artist to make so many class skins at the same time.
[1:12:07] doraymeyoh: another system for the team to spend all their time fixing all expansion instead of creating fun content for players to enjoy
[1:12:51] hectorian01: yes but when you think long term this talents will be a pain in the ass, too much of them
[1:12:52] Metket: @doraymeyoh shadowlands LUL
[1:12:54] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel I would actually be so Happy if Blizz just caved, hired a bunch of really cool artists, and just made these hero skins, even if only "slightly" like "oh hey lets make all your spells shadowy when in this form!"
[1:13:02] Nulgar: Hero talents can exist, but separate from visuals
[1:13:05] AtomJar: @doraymeyoh class designers are not the same people that make other contemt
[1:13:20] Sharktribe: It's still pre-alpha, so i expect there will be a lot of improvements on the previewed system
[1:13:53] dwolf010: I do want class altering stuff in a new expansion but also want class skins. and i think blizzard want that as well and it results in this. dont think they have enough artist to make so many class skins at the same time.
[1:13:56] Vaephera: If they cut hero talents they'd still have to go do regular talents instead
[1:14:12] crumbler81: not where I work, they are constantly adding useless managers LUL
[1:14:21] hectorian01: lets be positive, they responded well to feedback this expansion
[1:14:47] QQGamers: hopefully theyll be able to keep iterating quickly
[1:14:57] schlakt: any hopes for the new Oracle hero talent?
[1:15:22] TankenFunk: Hero Talents are still in design phase, so now is the perfect time to change them with minimal "damage"
[1:15:31] Metket: we would be shadow priests anyway thanks to x'alatath Kappa
[1:15:31] ver_flashbang: I hope max does a series on each hero talent tree with class representatives like he did for DF talents in alpha, that was a ton of valuable feedback.
[1:15:33] Dazzaw17: i hope they take dark rangers off and redesign that. thematically its just too tied to a race
[1:15:35] lumaday: like artifact appearances?
[1:15:39] BakedWeeb: sorry i was tabbed out and occupied but i just wanted to agree on the different jobs thing. level designer vs enviornment artist. The guy who scales the hill isnt the same guy who models it etc
[1:15:42] boubotte: I think it's a really good sign for the future of the game that they're willing to try things and take risks, while also being very sensible to player feedback
[1:15:44] BaneOfTheFallenKing: I don't think they'll be as bad as people think they are. I'm guessing it's a lot of SL ptsd
[1:15:46] Sharktribe: People like Asmon who are doing a chicken little thing for outrage-clicks are willfully mis-acknowledging that Blizz gave us their previews FOR the feedback SO they can change it...
[1:15:49] Trebled_Mind: Could they decide to make it cosmetic if reception is bad enough?
[1:16:03] MikeyGy: VOID PALADIN yes pls
[1:16:08] magemaster225: so a battle pass
[1:16:11] AtomJar: Again tho, i do want changes to my class. Playing the same way for 4 years doesnt sound great.
[1:16:14] TankenFunk: Getting to max level and then doing quests/grinds to unlock new versions (purely cosmetic) of your spells sounds like a lot of fun yeah
[1:16:23] Softex: "Aesthetics Power"
[1:16:33] DaveyBones: I just don't understand how they don't understand what we want. Why wouldn't they give us cosmetic changes? "Oh its because other PVP players wont recognize the abilites"... SO WHAT, THEY'LL LEARN
[1:16:36] vlaovich88: Give Abilities customization similar to dragons. Earn new colors and such. Would be fun
[1:16:50] XedL: Changes your Penance to Pennants
[1:17:04] CrossroadsDealer: yes exactly
[1:17:05] bladestitch: Would you rather have something like azerite armor or that they didn't try to do new things or at least try less often?
[1:17:15] Metket: people will love it x 1000
[1:17:17] xd_pad: give me Ashbringer made of white light when I cast Avenging Wrath
[1:17:17] lumaday: I would grind so many classes on something like that
[1:17:17] BakedWeeb: As a warlock I still use green fire when I play destro lmao. I wish we got more stuff like that even if it wasnt a skill based thing. Maybe side quest kinda stuff like heritage, the demon collecting etc
[1:17:20] ver_flashbang: Do I have to grind aestethic power with worldquests again? LuL
[1:17:22] Sharktribe: Like the dragonriding customization- ive never felt more motivated to do all kinds of content
[1:17:26] SciasWolf: Don't tie it to equipment, just have something like Alternate Advancement from EverQuest.
[1:17:36] AssumptionPrime: random tangential question: if Shadow Hunter were to be a Hero Talent tree or Class Skin, what class would it be for? I know it has "hunter" in it, but always struck me as vaguely shaman-y, maybe priest-y
[1:17:36] CrossroadsDealer: let me be a full fire Druid. all forms fire over the course of the expansion.
[1:17:38] NotIeni: Azerite power style achievments pleeees
[1:17:45] Atomicpanda: they'd make it too complicated to level
[1:17:50] BakedWeeb: a aesthetic grind would also make the system evergreen in future expansions
[1:17:54] ver_flashbang: "no one" :D
[1:17:58] Garysteel1984: people complain (full stop)
[1:18:01] XedL: You'd earn a small amount of Rhinestones as a currency from all activities ;)
[1:18:09] Zaelsus: What about linking unlocks to ability/combo usage? So you're passively unlocking it as the expansion goes on
[1:18:18] andr4ws: It will be the same as with most content... Rewards power: chore... Rewards cosmetics: only a small portion does it (Blizzard sees low interest)
[1:18:33] BakedWeeb: duality of man. wow is both too complicated and too easy LUL
[1:18:41] mxfelwinter: world first racers hates splits more than anybody, because they HAVE to do it
[1:18:46] dwolf010: would just remove the class altering stuff each expansion or do both class skins and a different type of talents? i like having class altering stuff each expac
[1:19:28] reggiepowa: at least it's easy to switch between them unlike covenants
[1:19:29] Ladryn: im more upset we have to level 1-80 on new characters again
[1:19:53] reggiepowa: I didn't mind covenants tbh when swapping between them became easy
[1:19:54] andr4ws: @Ladryn wdym? It's always been like that
[1:19:59] link4lif3: Demon hunter?
[1:20:09] xd_pad: I got flamed as a night fae shaman in shadowlands before it was cool. I was just RPing
[1:20:24] KatieRet_: because this feels like the opportunity to do class skins, theyre using all the themes people love
[1:20:25] Nulgar: @daveybones disagree with your thought that they don't know what "we" want, aa vague as that is, but yeah, fuck PvP. If it matters just disable the display of class skins on enemy players, while those players still see their changed visuals
[1:20:29] schlakt: WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR VOICE
[1:20:34] KyleS07: there will be a cookie cutter.
[1:20:55] ButterStains: I don’t understand why class skins weren’t introduced long ago
[1:20:57] KyleS07: builds are already cookie cutter. adding another layer is kinda lame.
[1:20:59] ButterStains: it makes so much sense
[1:21:02] AtomJar: I dont know if thats true tho, people wouldnt play "bad" classes if that was true
[1:21:22] ver_flashbang: min-maxing is fun if you do it to a suitable degree for yourself
[1:21:42] CrossroadsDealer: pvp is my favorite part of wow. love rated battlegrounds so much. I still would like everyone to have new spell looks and colors and aesthetics. would make pvp more complicated and fun.
[1:21:42] Dazzaw17: poe people follow maxroll guides lol
[1:21:46] andr4ws: You could say the same about talents nowadays also tho Tali. Enha shammies for example, they want to play Storm build, but they have to play Elementalist because much better
[1:21:52] Sch1ey: Poe is impossible to understand without spreading sheeting. Once you learn how resistance work its insane
[1:21:52] Sharktribe: I think my main issue with this new hero talent thing is that in the first two weeks i'll have it maxxed out, pick my two optional nodes and never open that interface on that character again : \
[1:22:01] TankenFunk: I never played PoE so I will always be better Kappa
[1:22:20] dwolf010: I honestly think blizzard thinks the only problem with covenants was that you could not freely swap (it was the biggest one but not the only one)
[1:22:23] Nulgar: Tbh 90percent of those that do, only look up builds instead of crafting their own, and that's on them alone
[1:22:32] dotonbori: Im a bit dissapointed there are 2 elf type Hunter 'hero talent' builds
[1:22:57] ButterStains: the dark ranger class fantasy is so longstanding in the community, I think it is an example/outlier where more people would pick it regardless of performance
[1:23:05] magemaster225: Arleosroblem with the hero talents is that theres no sign that they will be fluid, they act like tier sets but we are stuck with it for the whole xpac instead of a season
[1:23:07] Atomicpanda: by adding those names they sadly rule out ever making those things.
[1:23:15] Dazzaw17: @ButterStains two?
[1:23:18] AtomJar: Well tbf they may come with more cosmetic changes then we know.
[1:23:26] Metket: declined weekly no leaver because of class fantasy Sadge
[1:23:35] andr4ws: Yeah that's fair. :)
[1:23:35] mxfelwinter: because nothing say class fantasy like 15% more crit chance with X spell you already had
[1:23:43] Dazzaw17: @Dazzaw17 chat move, replied to wrong person
[1:23:55] ver_flashbang: If dark ranger or frostfire suck early on numbers wise the community will freak out xd
[1:24:05] crossmission: !gamble all
[1:24:14] dotonbori: @Dazzaw17 Sentinal is the Surv/MM one, can't it be something like 'Sniper' or 'Tracker'
[1:24:18] TaogWoW: I'm thinking about maining DK just to be a Rider of the Apocalypse Unholy/ San'Layn Blood DK
[1:24:20] CrossroadsDealer: fire Druid asthetics please. I got cat and boomkin now. I need fire tank form and fire standard form to complete
[1:24:21] StoicTaurus: I might be minority .. but I would cut at least 3 middle rows from normal talents first - then go into secondary tree
[1:24:21] grimblymcgoo: The freely swapping was a thing the community wanted AFTER they realized that blizz wasnt going to make sure all covenants were equal
[1:24:30] Dazzaw17: @dotonbori two? i get dark ranger, whats the other?
[1:24:36] neverbornlucky: I thought Taliesin was going to stream last epoch like everyone else
[1:24:37] ButterStains: @dotonbori which two are elf? agreed on dark ranger, do you see sentinel as an elf class?
[1:24:42] cosmopanda13: me too but it's mostly to deal with the different affixes
[1:24:52] Sharktribe: Another big issue i see with hero talents - there's a whole subclass for warriors using colossus, but colossus ITSELF is an optional talent in those trees, so one could feasibly just not have a build that the hero talents affect...
[1:25:02] caradosailanthus: I'm fairly happy with current talent trees.  I can mostly make playstyle adjustments from the Meta and still be viable in Heroic raid and M+ 18s
[1:25:09] dotonbori: @ButterStains Yeah I do, I picture Tyrande using her Owl
[1:25:11] Dazzaw17: @dotonbori ohhh i dint think of that
[1:25:31] KyleS07: absolutely makes sense.
[1:25:43] dwolf010: do you think we get an other preview on new hero talents? they wanted to show all of them before alpha but we are currently at like 10 shown and the alpha is really close accoring to the roadmap
[1:25:49] dotonbori: And I'd rather see something that embraced the Dwarf hunter from the OG cinematic or something to do with being a rifleman
[1:25:51] dwolf010: i mean this week
[1:25:57] ver_flashbang: Same for frostfire, you need comet/meteor
[1:26:01] AssumptionPrime: one of the reasons I never even tried SL was none of the covenants appealed to me from a thematic/fantasy standpoint. Worried that a lot of the Hero talents will feel the same. My marksman hunter's not an elf or undead, so I don't really like Dark Ranger, and I'm not a night elf, so Sentinel feels off, and I use lone wolf, so I don't care about Pack Master. So I'm left not caring about any of the Hero Talent fantasies
[1:26:08] ButterStains: @dotonbori fair, makes sense. In some ways, these should all be more race agnostic, which would free up class skins/concepts for later on
[1:26:24] neverbornlucky: Taliesin I heard that Steve was whispering in your ears
[1:26:25] Dazzaw17: @dotonbori if pack leader isnt rexxar im out
[1:26:48] mr_kinky: I remember being really sad when I got force to be necrolord shaman... All I wanted to be was night fae :(
[1:26:59] Sharktribe: @AssumptionPrime One good thing to consider: "sentinel" is a word that means a thing well outside of the specific WC3 nightelf context, so you could go with that
[1:26:59] dotonbori: @Dazzaw17 Aye that'll have to be, but I guess Hunters are so versitile that it's pigeon holing so many 'fantasies' into 3 small sub spaces
[1:27:08] Nulgar: Eh, the DF talents lock you into a lot of 'choices' just to reach some deep node.
[1:27:28] mxfelwinter: the only thing i am hopeful about hero talents...is that blademaster isnt one of them, so there still hope they may become a class in the future, tali xD
[1:27:36] Metket: i didn't like zaralek caverns type of map as well
[1:27:40] SpeciousArgument: even though each spec has access to two hero talent specs, thematically it seems like one is obvious choice and the other is "off-spec"
[1:27:45] ver_flashbang: @TaliesinAndEvitel How do you think hero talents will evolve into midnight and the last titan?
[1:28:13] XedL: Last day for the Prime Parrot Pet if that's your jam (shout out the MrGM tweet!)
[1:28:16] reggiepowa: that's true
[1:28:25] Dazzaw17: @TaliesinAndEvitel as a mainly outdoor player who cant raid anymore, im praying delves are good. its my most anticipated part of war within
[1:28:40] DarthTaz0: I'm in the minority here but I was really looking forward to trying Oracle. I even started leveling a priest to try it. But then I also enjoy Augmentation Evoker
[1:28:51] dwolf010: did you see Max's reaction to your " i dont like it, its shit" it the interview his reaction was golden lol
[1:28:52] Nontus135: how much change do people actually even want?
[1:29:19] Metket: LUL not my shaman
[1:29:27] Atomicpanda: be like turning a hunter spec into a melee spec
[1:29:27] TankenFunk: Balance druids on the other hand Kappa
[1:29:32] knightjudicator: i'd love support enhance as an OPTION, but i'd rather get a 4th spec
[1:29:41] sScottyKarate: happened to me and my combat rogue
[1:29:42] dergNwolf: I don't want other classes to suffer from having a support spec, like how devastation suffers phillieSad
[1:29:42] ver_flashbang: @dwolf010 it it on his yt or stream?
[1:29:48] Dazzaw17: or you cant go to a survival hunter and say its a melee spec now, wait....
[1:29:52] caradosailanthus: Just ask a feral main about that point Tali =P
[1:29:55] schlakt: well Said!
[1:30:02] VeronicaRotal: I am really afraid they're just gonna yeet Support. Far as I'm concerned Aug should go HARDER. Make zero damage itself. Buff even more. Full-on Group-only Spec.
[1:30:07] SpeciousArgument: I'd let blizzard turn my affliction spec into healing and demonology into a tank spec :D
[1:30:09] thayes523: Having been playing this game since the beginning I have hated every time that I have had to make changes to my warrior.
[1:30:21] Metket: except evokers nobody cares them
[1:30:32] BaneOfTheFallenKing: I mean, but you can be subject to a bit of change, right? Like in Legion, they completely changed surv hunter, demonlock...
[1:30:33] dwolf010: @ver_flashbang i watched it live on stream, but its probaly on his youtuibe aswell he uploaded the oracle stuff
[1:30:38] BaneOfTheFallenKing: they can get those right some times as well
[1:30:46] xd_pad: aug should have been a tank
[1:30:51] Atomicpanda: support should never been added
[1:30:57] dergNwolf: aug is still killing devastation and it suuuucks
[1:31:02] ButterStains: any chance they rethink a lot of these hero classes prior to war within? and veer more towards class skins? or do you think they are really locked in for the most part
[1:31:20] xd_pad: @dergNwolf I still play devastation. Super fun and it doesnt hurt my hand with 50 buttons
[1:31:21] lonesomecowboy: I kinda agree I think they should pull the plug on aug and make it a tank spec lol
[1:31:30] Wenlocke: Wenlocke subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! You need your entire game structure to be retrofitted or designed from scratch to add an entirely new role
[1:31:32] Sch1ey: I think the 1 support spec is the bigger problem not the group size
[1:31:59] Deatheran: honnestly if they made a bunch of the healers have a "support" spec so long as its balanced like current aug it would be fine. current aug is prety much not needed
[1:32:19] ver_flashbang: Aug. is also crazy hard on the support side when compared to ff14 brd/dnc/rdm
[1:32:21] DarthTaz0: you can't say the problem is there's only 1 support spec and also don't put support in my other classes
[1:32:28] mxfelwinter: a single very specific flavor of support
[1:32:39] neverbornlucky: Taliesin so wow SOD is becoming Retail ?
[1:32:41] Softex: should have been a tank spec
[1:32:47] link4lif3: Yeah they have 3 xpacs, multiple patches that they could have given each class one or two for this saga
[1:32:50] cosmopanda13: but aug is not a staple for M+ comps right now sometimes they run it and sometimes they don't isn't that a good spot to be?
[1:32:54] Metket: they go with 4 dps 1 tank in mdi anyway Kappa
[1:33:24] Wretcluse: because the spec is so unique if they released it at launch the other 2 specs would be much less represented imho.
[1:33:25] ver_flashbang: Augmentation is like 20% personal dps 80% group buff, ff14 supports are the other way around
[1:33:30] allisonjane78: what they did by introducing it late and kinda kept on the dl was ballsy and I respect that they tried it
[1:33:33] Ultapak12: Good day Tali!!
[1:33:37] cosmopanda13: that's not what I said :P
[1:33:40] Noznatation: Isn't that the same thing for all dmg specs?
[1:33:44] Nulgar: Or like in Vanilla, where there was one tank
[1:33:54] Nerraw3: I can't stand that 1/2 my guild wants to base our M+ runs off something they saw in the MDI.  There's a reason I'm not a CE/MDI/World First player...
[1:34:00] Sharktribe: I want a new DH spec. I want an aerial ranged guy. Maybe suppresses their demon form and flies/vaults around. Like, fel barrage and stuff.
[1:34:24] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel my hot take is all healers should get a "support" style hero talents, that would solve the issue. only problem then is making it so its not the defacto bis spec
[1:34:41] lonesomecowboy: yeah but aug still makes keys quite a bit easier like they just dont do the most damage which means they won't be in MDI
[1:34:50] VeronicaRotal: Isn't it really hard to be bad at Aug tho?
[1:34:53] reggiepowa: details has a guess with that shadowed bar
[1:34:53] cosmopanda13: I think the concensus is that it makes keys smoother but you lose dps
[1:35:07] greaterlock: ebon might and prescience uptime is a decent indicator
[1:35:14] cosmopanda13: but I do agree not being able to tell the numbers sucks
[1:35:21] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you mean you aren't looking forward to wow SOD being in retail ?
[1:36:06] JarJar_Brinkz: Whats the current story in the new phase?
[1:36:06] neverbornlucky: but Taliesin aren't hero specs just wow SOD specs?
[1:36:08] ver_flashbang: But retail bad REEEE
[1:36:11] DrGreatScott: Slightly unrelated, but how much of my soul do I have to sell to convince Blizz to make the Dreamtalon (Cat-raptors) a feral option? Heck even a talent option to use to use those travel forms for combat with a speed debuff could work. Feels like a waste given dragonriding being the mainstate of travel. Also curious why druids flight forms don't have dynamic flying yet. Any word on that?
[1:36:14] Triskelian: Then maybe you need to play SoD :D
[1:36:21] urbenjames: urbenjames subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! Wait, what xletha in sod?
[1:36:35] dergNwolf: @DrGreatScott when we are getting saberon form back phillieSad
[1:36:37] Nulgar: I just don't get why the combat log can't attribute the Aug contribution to the Aug - they increase Mainstat and Vers, that's a calculate contribution to individual spells
[1:36:40] dergNwolf: I want my saberon feral druid
[1:36:54] Nulgar: *calculable
[1:37:02] Rico_Azzarash: YES! WATER SHAMAN PLEASE!!!!
[1:37:03] alextheblight: true
[1:37:09] JarJar_Brinkz: It feels more fun to have actual different spells personally
[1:37:13] mxfelwinter: it is a way to retroactively make her active during the classic era storywise much better than they did with the jailer
[1:37:16] DrGreatScott: It always bothered me that Trolls learned from Gonk to be druids. A raptor Loa and we don't have that XD
[1:37:18] VeronicaRotal: 19 years plus pocket change and druids have no aquatic turtle form it is abominable
[1:37:19] Vecna00: Vecna00 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! 29 months!?!?
[1:37:24] MikeyGy: but Tali, the PVPers wont recognize the new siluetts Kappa
[1:37:34] AssumptionPrime: SoD speacs are a mix of classic specs and some abilities from later xpacs. There's a couple of new role outliers (lock tanks and such) but for the most part it's slightly modernized versions of classic gameplay
[1:37:35] ffileaf: I want my nelf priest to be a priestess of elune BibleThump
[1:37:39] elbardo_ts: hello o/ what are we talking about?
[1:38:01] DrGreatScott: @dergNwolf Agreed! Or them as a full race would be great!
[1:38:13] BaneOfTheFallenKing: demonlock as well
[1:38:20] Triskelian: @elbardo_ts Hero talents/SoD and SoD leading into TWW
[1:38:24] Nulgar: @elbardo_ts tali is being a doomer tneTali
[1:38:25] alextheblight: should have been able to dualwield
[1:38:26] Dazzaw17: i was a survival main, im still salty now
[1:38:46] elbardo_ts: @Nulgar so another day in the office? tneEvi
[1:39:06] Nulgar: @elbardo_ts yup.
[1:39:08] Triskelian: @elbardo_ts Pretty much :D
[1:39:21] ver_flashbang: early legion survival was so resource flooded it played very weird
[1:39:22] gabhion: The problem with survival is nothing to do with the spec itself, but that a melee heavy dps choice game changed a ranged spec into a melee one.
[1:39:36] bladestitch: Didn't play legion but from what everyone keeps saying about it's like it was perfect, no faults.
[1:39:36] alextheblight: with bow animations
[1:39:51] Rico_Azzarash: Orc-brows-hero-talents when? XDDD
[1:39:52] JarJar_Brinkz: I want to be a real pirate P)
[1:40:17] link4lif3: mechanic monkey
[1:40:18] jskillz777: its still semi ranged
[1:40:22] Sharktribe: Survival as melee is amazing. Variety is the spice of life. Hunting with a melee weapon is a thing- see spears and mammoths, etc
[1:40:30] elbardo_ts: most survival abilities are ranged, they could do a talent that change raptor strike into a range attack
[1:40:34] SpeciousArgument: they could add 4th spec to existing classes. druid shows it can be done
[1:40:46] Reminii91: still remember that DK tank in a pug who had a child's tandrem and wouldn't keep going until I switch to Holy becuz he still believed the trend that disp priest is not a good healer.... for a leveling pug dungeon. This was when they nerfed dk tank a bit and he couldn't understand why he was moresquishy
[1:40:47] elbardo_ts: and carve too
[1:40:50] bladestitch: Could survival be made tank?
[1:41:17] schlakt: is that the shadowflame skin or the regular one you got there?
[1:41:19] Dazzaw17: i miss explosive shot weaving. loved the playstyle
[1:41:21] Nulgar: @speciousargument that was splitting two roles of one spec into two
[1:41:22] DrGreatScott: It's fun as hell! But it... misses the mark ;P
[1:41:43] Durwen: I've done BM and MM, and I wouldn't touch Survival if my life depended on it
[1:41:49] GoldSmog: Survival was pretty good in m+ SL
[1:41:50] Deatheran: i just wish i could have dual wielded axes... i wanted to RP as rexar so bad. but i think the spec was designed around the legion legendary spear @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:41:51] Durwen: I hate it fundamentally
[1:41:53] ver_flashbang: They take mop/wod survival away but put it into SoD now just for melee hunter to be dominant there as well hahahahaha
[1:41:56] elbardo_ts: i like survival more than MM to be honest
[1:42:03] elbardo_ts: i miss legion MM
[1:42:11] ButterStains: MM is goat tier
[1:42:23] Sharktribe: 4th specit up
[1:42:23] Zaelsus: Yeah,one thing I wished for was a hand axe throwing hunter
[1:42:30] neverbornlucky: Taliesin can Hunters finally be tank with their pet ?
[1:42:35] bladestitch: Make it like classic, ranged but if I want I can run in an pummel people.
[1:42:36] elbardo_ts: i hate MM's precise shots
[1:42:37] alextheblight: I was genuinely surprised when I learned surv can't use two 1 handers
[1:42:40] mantooth11: survial is the most fun hunter spec, but 99% of hunters just want bm
[1:42:51] TankenFunk: I personally think they should merge the two DH specs into one and then give druid another spec Kappa
[1:42:51] AssumptionPrime: It's wild the gulf between retail and SoD. Melee hunter is THE hunter spec in SoD right now. Seeing a hunter actually use ranged is a novelty. I mean, them being different is a given, but it's just interesting to see.
[1:42:59] DrGreatScott: Rexxar mocks the players for not being able to dual wield proper and use their abilities
[1:43:14] Sorin__: what would we call the shaman tank spec?
[1:43:25] Honorbound94: @TaliesinAndEvitel Nice haircut!
[1:43:27] QQGamers: maybe the hero talents will lead to new specs? that would be nice
[1:43:27] ver_flashbang: @AssumptionPrime Yeah but only because it tops the meters, the playstyle is stupid even for sod.
[1:43:31] alextheblight: @Sorin__ enhancement Kappa
[1:44:08] elbardo_ts: archon is the other holy hero talent, right?
[1:44:19] QQGamers: true
[1:44:19] elbardo_ts: and voidweaver is the other disc one, right?
[1:44:29] TankenFunk: @elbardo_ts correct
[1:44:29] Deatheran: wouldent oracle have just been normal healing spec with a new PI button tho @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:44:40] TankenFunk: @elbardo_ts probably correct Kappa
[1:44:43] DrGreatScott: It's def a double edge sword. Add a new specc and potentially water-down the abilities across the board or revamp a specc entire.
[1:44:48] Nulgar: Yeah Surv and Feral/Guardian need dual-wielding - but first there needs to be change so that you only need one 1h item to equip two items, like several Artifacts
[1:45:01] saarkhastick: Are we being forced to spec into the hero talents or can you just ignore them?
[1:45:29] Deatheran: @saarkhastick not speccing them would be like not using the last 10 points in your talent trees
[1:45:33] Metket: @saarkhastick 70-80 additional talents
[1:45:41] schlakt: why does it take so long for confirmstion? what are they doing?
[1:45:51] bladestitch: Do you think the players should have an input for when they do new ideas long before it is presented? Probably can't because of legal stuff though.
[1:45:57] TankenFunk: @saarkhastick Would be hard to ignore them completely, but many specs change very little, or will only change one ability, the rest are passives
[1:46:18] diyreality: sounds like something an addon would have sorted
[1:46:30] neverbornlucky: Taliesin admit it you rather play priest hero  buy donald trump cologne so you can smell like a dick too
[1:46:53] ver_flashbang: Ah so it really was FF14 astrologian, throw card buffs but forget to heal.
[1:47:08] urbenjames: I want that add-on XD
[1:47:29] Deatheran: it would have been WAY better if it just gave you a few different buttons instead of having to time pick the right buff
[1:48:13] mxfelwinter: it's like saying Ninja is just WoW's Rogues...they are nowhere close
[1:48:24] ver_flashbang: My joke got lost somewhere :s
[1:48:47] diyreality: @ver_flashbang mine too, serious talk is serious talk
[1:49:09] ver_flashbang: i meant attention wise that ppl forget to heal :D
[1:49:13] Sch1ey: I think the cycle could be cool but as a dps spell rather then buff
[1:49:14] elbardo_ts: there's still another option for both holy and disc that we have no idea about
[1:49:57] Deatheran: man who knew back when the desinged PI it would be such a problem later on.
[1:50:02] KatieRet_: but what if it's shit
[1:50:27] ShadowDragon14855: Morning all
[1:50:39] SpeciousArgument: @Sorin__ Astral shaman
[1:50:44] schlakt: frost fire mage really is the first one im excited for
[1:51:01] TankenFunk: Woohoo! Best part of the stream!!
[1:51:03] TankenFunk: :D
[1:51:03] Rico_Azzarash: Еру куфыщт шы Сщаауу
[1:51:08] Rico_Azzarash: The reason is coffee
[1:51:12] cabeshpash: tali taking a poo?
[1:51:14] Arlaeya: hurray the brb!
[1:51:16] neverbornlucky: Taliesin wants to smell like Donald Trump
[1:51:19] funviking99: FallCry
[1:51:20] Gaming_Mama56: Jaina throwing Tali as kiss as he leaves the room to poo
[1:51:21] diyreality: the chonky boii
[1:51:21] casualviewerxqt: whats going on
[1:51:39] cabeshpash: @neverbornlucky u know what trump smells like lol?
[1:51:48] RileyDoodles_: tneNzothEye tneNzothEye
[1:52:26] neverbornlucky: cabeshpash , donald trump is selling a new cologne so now we all can find out
[1:52:35] cabeshpash: gross lol
[1:52:51] cabeshpash: grifters gonna grift I guess

[1:54:55] thunduz: wow there’s a screen I haven’t seen in a while
[1:56:09] Warbeast78: the old ian bits were pretty good
[1:56:09] diyreality: the game ideas are wild
[1:56:12] elbardo_ts: you should add a penny photo to that screen
[1:56:24] thunduz: how’s today going fam?
[1:56:44] neverbornlucky: Taliesin we said that You can smell like  Donald Trump now cause you can buy donald trump cologne

[1:57:50] cabeshpash: bio??
[1:57:55] Honorbound94: @gyalogkakukk05 No problem!
[1:58:04] Rico_Azzarash: What I nean is coffee is a diuretic
[1:58:05] ver_flashbang: Thank god he isn't smoking :D
[1:58:08] Rico_Azzarash: *mean xD
[1:58:10] cabeshpash: lol TIL
[1:58:14] neverbornlucky: Taliesin we were teasing that now you can smell like a dick by buying donald trump cologne
[1:58:15] bladestitch: What would be your reaction if Tol Dagor was added to a future M+ rotation?
[1:58:17] Nevom_: Any news on the pirate patch yet?
[1:58:17] seanstrachan: You know about the new Exploring Azeroth book?
[1:58:21] Honorbound94: @TaliesinAndEvitel I want you to give a detailed breakdown of how to play Disc and not lose your mind lol
[1:58:41] Warbeast78: but does it turn my face orange
[1:58:41] cabeshpash: tali cologne?
[1:58:43] logicaltty: When is your cologne coming out?
[1:58:50] Gaming_Mama56: First heard Bio break in raid
[1:58:50] Softex: if you want to smell like him, you can just poop your pants
[1:58:53] RileyDoodles_: Lionel Richie cologne
[1:59:06] diyreality: maybe we all get a pirate patch in the mail on april 1st
[1:59:08] bettys_dungeon_adventures: i think trump cologne would smell like jean nate and mysogeny
[1:59:16] doomer_dan_: fuck tol dagor
[1:59:16] diyreality: pirate eye patch*
[1:59:28] dwolf010: I think we get news about season 4 before 10.2.6
[1:59:30] urbenjames: Give me Maw of souls in M+ cowards
[1:59:42] RileyDoodles_: its the marks and spencer fragrance for old people
[1:59:46] elbardo_ts: what shadowlands dungeon would you like to see added to tww m+ pool?
[1:59:57] diyreality: wait wait s4 is soon?
[2:00:18] Vaephera: @elbardo_ts Mists but it's just the maze section 4 times
[2:00:18] Thoreya: alpha april?
[2:00:22] bigoldmeatpie: timerunning tho
[2:00:32] bettys_dungeon_adventures: did we ever find out what the pirate patch was about
[2:00:33] Boflex8: I'm thinking the 10.2.6 patch is going to be a "casino" like place  for players
[2:00:38] Deatheran: Wait what dungeon rotation ? I've missed that
[2:00:57] cabeshpash: :(
[2:01:06] netonkent: Ap
[2:01:13] cabeshpash: I wish they would keep some of the legacy dungeons
[2:01:15] Carsias: oh is that confirmed already?
[2:01:17] chryseis: I'm curious as to why they would pick Pandaria specifically
[2:01:24] cabeshpash: it gets boring doing they same 8 over and over
[2:01:28] KatieRet_: I didn't even play season 1 or 2 and I'm not excited for it
[2:01:30] ver_flashbang: Brackenhide, yuck
[2:01:31] TaogWoW: what are the new open world rewards in S4?
[2:01:33] netonkent: Any news on housing yet ? Haha
[2:01:39] cabeshpash: @ver_flashbang ya this is the worst one
[2:01:40] Saevash: i'd love to run the DF dungeons on m+ for the portals :D
[2:01:46] cabeshpash: I'm gonna miss everbloom
[2:01:52] Metket: it should be all df dungeons
[2:01:53] chryseis: I did love it, so no complaints from me!
[2:02:01] AtomJar: Start of anduin stuff too
[2:02:06] cabeshpash: wrath is the best chrome time
[2:02:06] link4lif3: i THINK THE QUESTS JUST FLOW REALLY WELL, YOURE NEVER CONFUSED ON WHERE TO GO
[2:02:10] link4lif3: woah c aps
[2:02:21] Milanesa_De_Pollo: WoD chromie time is probably popular because of speed
[2:02:23] neverbornlucky: Taliesin, diablo players want managament to tweet emotes of pirates like muffin did
[2:02:31] Dazzaw17: i always do legion for the class hall and the mount on new characters
[2:02:45] RileyDoodles_: it also gives you some good anduin lore before the WW
[2:02:49] bigoldmeatpie: i use mists because the quests are more concentrated in the quest hubs. it feels like the most efficient
[2:02:53] chryseis: Fingers crossed for Wrathion quests back then
[2:03:16] Metket: heartstone event on 10.2.5 column so 10.2.6 must be later then that
[2:03:17] bladestitch: I would love an event with small stories that plays through things that were not covered ingame.
[2:03:18] astralumi: we did it!
[2:03:21] cabeshpash: @Dazzaw17 I wish they would've kept class halls in the new expansions, it's a really cool concept
[2:03:28] JNYB: What are the odds we get our own boats
[2:03:31] QQGamers: we only have ourselves to blame
[2:03:34] QQGamers: lol
[2:03:35] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel what if timerunning is a new guided player experience to give them a run through time to let them experience all the major story elements leading up to "now" to fix that issue of new people trying to get the story without the awfulness that is the leveling experience story delivery.
[2:03:36] Pannekaker: Oh I won't forget this
[2:04:04] ButterStains: would be nice to tie in order halls to hero classes somehow, I miss that
[2:04:08] ver_flashbang: @FelPlague No way that'd be in a "small" patch though
[2:04:22] Durwen: yay
[2:04:30] cabeshpash: lol
[2:04:40] Carsias: what is path of the curator
[2:04:41] Dazzaw17: @cabeshpash yeah, i love them. I wish class halls were somehow a seperate thing, not locked in an expansion.
[2:04:47] ButterStains: it’s wild how few new players have actually played through the lore
[2:04:53] ButterStains: no wonder they’re confused
[2:04:54] Nulgar: Pirate Tuskarr?
[2:05:00] Zaelsus: But what if Tali, bear with me on this... Pirate Tuskarr!?
[2:05:13] astralumi: Tali is a pro at explaining path of the curator by now
[2:05:14] diyreality: I do think we need a goblin/gnome, a 2 seater flying mount and something like a sped up story with funny comments. Like here Deathwing burned a lot of sand, cause he prolly hated sand
[2:05:14] Zaelsus: @Nulgar I like the way you think LUL
[2:05:46] link4lif3: its a leveling guide - the guide + story
[2:05:48] ButterStains: I wish path of the curator went through the whole story, all expacs, with leveling scaled
[2:05:50] funviking99: why we don’t have that? FallCry
[2:05:59] beaconstar313: So, will minor quests not be there? Only the curated ones?
[2:05:59] ButterStains: I don’t think it matters if it takes time, that is part of the appeal
[2:06:14] Zaelsus: The follower dungeon system does fit in well with the path of the curator idea
[2:06:14] cabeshpash: @ButterStains 100% I don't like how you only choose one expansion now
[2:06:24] xd_pad: Do I get invincible when I kill the lich king?
[2:06:36] Metket: killed the lich king go back to classic now and you logoff
[2:06:36] netonkent: I think if no playable tuskar before 11.0 then it will be an last titan thing with the return to northern
[2:06:52] cabeshpash: lol true
[2:07:04] protomanex14: is path of the curator a real thing?
[2:07:07] ver_flashbang: You get like 1/3 done and kicked out
[2:07:23] ButterStains: @cabeshpash it should force you to do the whole thing the first time for new players
[2:07:27] protomanex14: shame it would be great
[2:07:30] Dazzaw17: My mage is 50 and still in Bastion
[2:07:40] link4lif3: I wish heirlooms didnt mess with XP and just scaled
[2:07:45] 블루치즈맨: would it be milestone-based xp? otherwise you could hit 60 before or after killing Arthas
[2:07:47] ButterStains: I know that’s controversial for people who just want to jump in, but you miss so much of the lore
[2:08:09] ButterStains: no, we’re talking about the WHOLE story taking time, having a curated journey through ALL expacs for new players
[2:08:17] xd_pad: give players cool transmog sets for completing a curated path
[2:08:19] bigoldmeatpie: @l1nk4l1f3 heirlooms haven't increased exp gains in a couple expansions
[2:08:20] ButterStains: yes
[2:08:25] caradosailanthus: WoW no longer needs levels
[2:08:38] link4lif3: they mess with rested XP aand all my alts have been logged out in inns for years
[2:08:43] cabeshpash: they would have to cherry pick story elements to make that work probably
[2:08:43] Nulgar: Nope, fuck the FFXIV method
[2:08:53] neverbornlucky: Taliesin , last epoch has had s many server isues and badlaunch that makes blizzard loo ike a saint but people still putting down diablo4 and raving good praise for last epoch
[2:09:04] ButterStains: I think people just miss lore and characters coming in and out, etc. It’s no wonder people are confused - they haven’t played through so much of the story.
[2:09:05] ver_flashbang: FF14 will also run into the problem in the near future that it's just "too much" for some new players, you kind of need a condensed experience.
[2:09:34] protomanex14: e poch
[2:10:01] Atomicpanda: blizz barely finished expansion anyway
[2:10:06] cabeshpash: diablo 3 had a really rough launch, and it still was super popular
[2:10:09] netonkent: I wish I could play any expansion even at max level but still integrated with the rest of the world
[2:10:17] protomanex14: @neverbornlucky last epoch is good though
[2:10:29] MakkitoTV: MakkitoTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[2:10:34] doomer_dan_: i mean the same happened with Helldivers 2. The first couple weeks, trying to get in was a nightmare. But i didn't mind because its actually a great game
[2:10:36] Nulgar: Many will pretend these issues never happened to shit on Blizz
[2:10:37] Trebled_Mind: Baldur’s Gate 3 is winning so many awards all the way through the new year that I’m convinced Larian will need a legitimate trophy room 😂
[2:10:42] Warbeast78: ive enjoyed last epoch as well.  Im an offline mode lover so its been great
[2:10:51] ver_flashbang: server issues are just temporary anyways
[2:10:52] NotIeni: Last Epoch costs half of DIV and is made by a company 100x smaller tho, so idk about "saints" really lol
[2:11:01] crumbler81: please don't talk about BG3...already have 900 hours in and I'm not ready for another play through LUL
[2:11:19] MikeyGy: Have you heard Larians acceptance speaches on dice awards? good stuff
[2:11:48] cabeshpash: both divinity games are great
[2:11:50] 안티가: 안티가 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[2:11:52] SilverkissTwitch: Last Epoch is an amazing game for hardcore ARPG players, but for people who are just tangentially interested in the genre I can see how it wouldn't look like that amazing
[2:12:06] neverbornlucky: Taliesin just wants a excuse for naked statue man on him
[2:12:12] 안티가: <3
[2:12:27] ver_flashbang: larian studios and fromsoftware are really good in just evolving what they're great at, we need more of that
[2:12:39] SilverkissTwitch: Oh yeah my comment was for chat not for you specifically Tali :p
[2:13:05] mxfelwinter: my only big problem with BG3...are just my problems with 5e DnD ruleset and design
[2:13:27] protomanex14: i wish we still had old Bioware NotLikeThis
[2:13:36] xd_pad: Make True Strike Great Again
[2:13:41] Swoophy: yo wdup fellas

[2:15:21] neverbornlucky: Taliesin have you watched solo leveling yhet ?
[2:15:46] Atomicpanda: anime
[2:15:51] neverbornlucky: its the newest and greatest anime
[2:16:00] Honorbound94: @TaliesinAndEvitel DUDE you need to watch Undead Unluck on Hulu!
[2:16:03] SpeciousArgument: Love BG3. I hope they'll make a DnD game like it, but not set in or around the Sword Coast at some point
[2:16:03] ver_flashbang: The "power fantasy"
[2:16:07] Softex: deliciouls in dungeons
[2:16:11] Trebled_Mind: delicious in dungeon
[2:16:11] kaijoe_: Tali, you'd love Frieren, I think.
[2:16:12] Softex: *delicious
[2:16:13] Atomicpanda: delicious in dungeon. that one is fun
[2:16:14] Gaming_Mama56: delicious in dungeon
[2:16:18] neverbornlucky: Taliesin google grinning  statue memes of manga
[2:16:20] thunduz: ok what kind of chats have I missed today? Did you talk about the live action avatar?
[2:16:21] Gaming_Mama56: We love that show
[2:16:24] Davykuro: A very good anime and manga
[2:16:24] cosmopanda13: you might enjoy frieren
[2:16:28] cabeshpash: the castlevania show on Netflix is so good
[2:16:31] Travnar: Give me my damn Warcraft anime/ala Arcane
[2:16:33] mxfelwinter: i think it was called calabozos y tragones in spanish
[2:16:41] bladestitch: Did you see the Dungeon & Dragons movie?
[2:16:42] Nulgar: Solo Levelling, that's Self-Found, right? Single-player WoW
[2:16:48] Sharktribe: It's WONDERFUL
[2:16:55] thunduz: I knew the answer but I had to ask lol
[2:16:58] KatieRet_: it's great! but im thinking id probably rather just be watching the original
[2:17:00] Redmanpig: heard you mention True Detective on the podcast
[2:17:02] Atomicpanda: it's terrible
[2:17:03] vlaovich88: Did you see Exon is sueing their shareholders because they are pushing for making the company more clean and exon is claiming the shareholders are abusing being a shareholder.
[2:17:07] sScottyKarate: it isnt
[2:17:08] Gaming_Mama56: Some classice just don't need remakes
[2:17:14] DarthTaz0: I watched the first episode and it was accurate to my memory of the first couple episodes of the cartoon.
[2:17:31] diyreality: @vlaovich88 theonion?
[2:17:32] thunduz: very very valid
[2:17:40] DarthTaz0: seeing the Fire Nation burn monks alive in live action hits different though
[2:17:42] ArkyteCurse: As someone who didn't watch the cartoon, the Netflix show has now made me want to watch the cartoon because I want to know what happens next
[2:17:42] allisonjane78: I was skeptical af about the live action avatar but honestly it was really good. I binged the entire thing start to finish lol
[2:17:42] MrScotticus: Based on everything I've seen, it's awful. Totally ignores what made the original good to try to be edgy and mature
[2:17:45] vlaovich88: @diyreality I wish
[2:18:05] bladestitch: The One Piece is a great adaptation.
[2:18:17] honka_s69: honka_s69 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:18:21] Trebled_Mind: I’m not gonna watch the live action ATLA. I just feel that animated shows should just stay the way they are. The magic of the original show is magical for a reason.
[2:18:33] gefuffel: i could never watch one piece though... tooo many episodes lol
[2:18:34] ver_flashbang: """ I could just watch one piece""" LuL
[2:18:37] neverbornlucky: Taliesin the last airbinder netflix makes british people look tame when occupying other places to take over
[2:18:41] ver_flashbang: see ya in 10 years
[2:18:57] cosmopanda13: some people just don't enjoy animation unfortunately
[2:19:03] Atomicpanda: didn't work for cowboy bebop
[2:19:04] Gaming_Mama56: make a live action of a manga no one heard of
[2:19:07] bladestitch: Watching the anime one piece is a big undertaking with over 1000 episodes. XD
[2:19:11] Davykuro: live adaptation cannot be superior to the original when we talking Japanese manga creation
[2:19:14] AssumptionPrime: I'm just so tired of companies taking a really good animated show and trying to live-action it. I genuinely believe it can never be better than the original animated work, and just feels pointless and crass
[2:19:17] Nulgar: I mean, it's easy to improve upon One Piece
[2:19:44] kiewies: When they got to the Grand Line is when I fell off of One Piece
[2:19:49] DrGreatScott: Slightly unrelated (but exec bs) I'm just sad that Warner is holding the carrot over our heads with the Coyote Vs. Acme film. Tax write off to the IRS for 30 mil, but won't sell it to other companies for less than 75 mil. No one gets it and we all lose
[2:20:00] Travnar: Game of Thrones might be the show that comes to mind most when I think of something that clearly needed more seasons.
[2:20:04] CrossroadsDealer: loves season 4!!!!
[2:20:05] neverbornlucky: Taliesin , Solo Leveling is basically a dungeon raiding anime with a necro killing everything . Its great
[2:20:06] TheDeekins: Season 3 is great, highly recommended
[2:20:07] Mazerbeam: Season 4 was fantastic!
[2:20:14] CrossroadsDealer: so great. amazing acting
[2:20:15] TinySp00k: 4>1 danHmm
[2:20:16] bomayaa: don't spoil seaon 4 please!
[2:20:19] GoldSmog: When Covid hit, I watched every single One Piece episode. It was wonderful
[2:20:25] cabeshpash: season 1 is still my fav
[2:20:31] ButterStains: @drgreatscott I don’t understand how those schemes aren’t just tax fraud, it’s wild
[2:20:31] doomer_dan_: I wish Lost had 1000 episodes
[2:20:32] aeson_of_raid_sock: there’s some good true crime shows on max
[2:20:32] Zaelsus: There's plans to redo the One Piece anime, mainly updating the old animations and removing most of the filler so it's more streamlined
[2:20:39] kiewies: Season 3 is set in the region I'm from
[2:20:51] thunduz: I have heard great things but haven't checked it out yet
[2:21:00] thunduz: still need to watch blue eye samurai
[2:21:05] magemaster225: s3 is p good, doesnt finish very strong though, but leagues better than s2
[2:21:06] gryffiest: my thing is ATLA is already perfect imo so why create something that is a shadow of it
[2:21:07] Thoreya: season 1 is my fav by far
[2:21:08] mxfelwinter: breaking bad and better call saul are the shows that when it ended, i felt the same depression that it ended as i get in many story based single player games
[2:21:10] wanik90: when season one didn’t turn into a cosmic horror story I was genuinely disappointed lol
[2:21:13] cabeshpash: yeah I agree with that
[2:21:23] kiewies: You MUST watch Blue Eyed Samurai Thunduz!!!
[2:21:29] CrossroadsDealer: woody’s actions with the young woman are terrible. and not terrible in the suppose to be terrible way
[2:21:40] twootten: what show is this? i just joined
[2:21:45] cabeshpash: @CrossroadsDealer I think he was supposed to be scummy character tho
[2:21:51] LordFaunty: @twootten true detective
[2:21:54] Trebled_Mind: There’s definitely some episodes of IT Crowd that didn’t age well too.
[2:22:07] DrGreatScott: @ButterStains When you control the system, you make the rules I guess. But honestly, if it becomes a write off like that, there should be a policy where they have to sell it for the write off value. And even if it gets written off it should be available to buy thereafter
[2:22:19] crumbler81: what changed? hasn't violence towards women always been bad?
[2:22:20] nila: nila subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[2:22:22] CrossroadsDealer: @cabeshpash I agree, but those scenes are played for male enjoyment not to be scuzzy.
[2:22:33] cabeshpash: yeah that's fair lol
[2:22:49] ButterStains: have you seen the theories that true detective is set in the lovecraft universe?
[2:23:35] TinySp00k: It made me want to move to Alaska tho
[2:23:47] cabeshpash: @ButterStains check out lovecraft country if you like lovecraftian stuff
[2:24:04] twootten: ending was :chefs kiss:
[2:24:21] cabeshpash: yup
[2:24:23] Honorbound94: Yeah it was
[2:24:24] Trebled_Mind: yes
[2:24:25] Deatheran: ye
[2:24:25] Nimsh: yeah
[2:24:26] CeasiusPls: Yeah..
[2:24:31] Mazerbeam: Read Lovecraft Country*
[2:24:36] doomer_dan_: oh it's not a maybe, he's for sure out
[2:24:37] Sharktribe: Lovecraft country is sort of hit and mixed, some episodes not as strong as others
[2:24:40] bettys_dungeon_adventures: lovecraft country was great
[2:24:42] magemaster225: do you watch fargo, the newest season is very good
[2:24:42] Sharktribe: *miss derp
[2:24:46] netonkent: That sounds like a dunser take Tali 😝💙
[2:24:51] kiewies: I served Mahershala Ali tea when he came to film in my region for season 3 of True Detective and that is my claim to fame.
[2:25:01] plopptart: this week in wow is up
[2:25:11] TheDeekins: nah I disagree, Lovecraft Country is better than any season of True Detective, and I LOVE True Detective
[2:25:13] cabeshpash: I like game of thrones until the end
[2:25:14] thunduz: oh! thoughts of Pedro being Mr. Fantastic?!
[2:25:24] ffileaf: Do you  have any upcoming lore speculation/predictions videos coming soon? PopCorn
[2:25:28] KyleS07: Lovecraft is based on a book. I’d recommend reading the book.
[2:25:37] neverbornlucky: Taliesin nooo google solo leveling laughing statue meme pic
[2:25:42] KyleS07: sorry Lovecraft Country.
[2:25:44] aeson_of_raid_sock: lovecraft country is awesome because it features black heroes when lovecraft was a horrible racist
[2:26:09] Sharktribe: @aeson_of_raid_sock Indeed
[2:26:13] diyreality: bunny ears?
[2:26:19] Nulgar: single-player WoW
[2:26:22] Syzmical: its ironman mode from osrs
[2:26:23] Sharktribe: Self-found mode: AKA any single player RPG
[2:26:31] KyleS07: Better than Lovecraft Country is The Ballad of Black Tom.
[2:26:43] cabeshpash: @aeson_of_raid_sock this pissed off so many white people lol
[2:26:44] iamdrewonline: you can group
[2:26:50] Atomicpanda: single player no group? sounds like me. jinx
[2:26:51] saarkhastick: Wait you can group in WoW?
[2:26:59] TheDeekins: they were gonna call it Taliesin Mode but they didn't want to pay the royalties
[2:27:00] cabeshpash: self found sounds so tedious to me
[2:27:01] Merex760: grouping seems fine, probably no trading
[2:27:01] thunduz: no idea what this is or how it works
[2:27:22] Nimsh: hope we get to see some lock trees
[2:27:24] Kainiee: the promo is amazon prime
[2:27:31] uglukz: legion stuff?
[2:27:32] Merex760: green stuff Pog
[2:27:34] funviking99: green again?

[2:27:36] Syzmical: it is parade day coming, saint pattys day
[2:27:37] saarkhastick: Happy St Paddy's Day
[2:27:39] Honorbound94: @TaliesinAndEvitel I'm sorry what is Gravity? I think you meant Mavity
[2:27:39] Nulgar: aw yiss, more Fel stuff
[2:27:44] saarkhastick: Green Is Good
[2:27:45] Trebled_Mind: pvp mavity
[2:27:48] diyreality: might be new prime drop since the parrot ends tomorrow
[2:27:48] mxfelwinter: ironic enough the racist fear in lovecraft stories end up very easily adaptable as fear of racists
[2:27:50] Sharktribe: ST. Patrick's day: The Irish holiday Americans care about way more than Irish people do
[2:27:55] Deatheran: 8 new hero talent trees is going to be big
[2:27:56] Atomicpanda: green, for lack of a better word, is good
[2:28:05] funviking99: LUL
[2:28:08] Syzmical: im getting so stupid drunk this pattys day
[2:28:11] cosmopanda13: thank god for hero talents to have something to talk about
[2:28:11] ButterStains: what is our expected timeline for .2.6?
[2:28:16] dright424: Eight hero talents is a good amount to show at once
[2:28:25] IanSabrewolfe: Calling a Leprechaun Transmog set reward now.
[2:28:26] Merex760: what month would be blue colors...may?
[2:28:29] Atomicpanda: there's a reference?
[2:28:39] caradosailanthus: Completely ignoring St. Joseph's Day
[2:28:50] bladestitch: Nothing interesting will appear until you post a video with predictions that will be wrong by the time you post it.
[2:28:50] Atomicpanda: lol
[2:28:56] uglukz: ohhhhhh
[2:29:06] michaelmm: They have announced dates without mentioning them in the week in wow before!
[2:29:07] Syzmical: bobby kotiks fav line
[2:29:08] Deatheran: saying "blues news" makes it sound like blues clues LUL
[2:29:21] saarkhastick: 3/17
[2:29:29] shaymster: I want a leprechaun mog
[2:29:32] chryseis: Bartending at a Canadian Irish pub on st Patrick's day, pray for me lmao
[2:29:48] Nimsh: 17th is  a sunday
[2:29:55] saarkhastick: In America it just means that everyone gets wasted and acts stupid at parades
[2:29:58] ButterStains: do we have a date for season 4?
[2:29:58] thunduz: they do
[2:30:04] thunduz: especially chicago lol
[2:30:06] cabeshpash: it's just an excuse to get wasted here lol
[2:30:07] Kainiee: right after hearthstone event
[2:30:13] bettys_dungeon_adventures: we love celebrating fake holidays LUL
[2:30:18] Syzmical: @TaliesinAndEvitel why are people like Bobby exempt from the typical pushback from the harassments and threats hes made
[2:30:21] saarkhastick: And they drink shit light beer colored green
[2:30:21] cabeshpash: everyone claims to be Irish on said Patricks day lol
[2:30:27] Atomicpanda: any excuse to drink and be gross
[2:30:29] caradosailanthus: Americans make everything into a reason to drink
[2:30:30] aeson_of_raid_sock: I hate st. Patrick’s day. amateurs everywhere
[2:30:30] DrGreatScott: Americans use any holiday as an excuse to drink
[2:30:30] Arlaeya: I live in NYC.... we stay inside. all tourists puking green beer into the streets
[2:30:35] chryseis: Canadian beer is strong af
[2:30:35] IanSabrewolfe: St Patricks in the US is pretty bad.  Especially those crazy Bostonians.
[2:30:37] doomer_dan_: it is cringe. it's so weird that we go so hard for Cinco de Mayo and St. Patricks day in the US
[2:30:45] thunduz: we like celebrations
[2:30:46] bigcowboyg: that's not why the beers weak.
[2:30:48] caradosailanthus: Like Americans "celebrating" Cinco De MAyo
[2:30:48] LordKurgen: what’s the worst that can happen in a Canadian bar? they forget to say thank you?
[2:30:54] ButterStains: one day a year? please, we have one commercial holiday a month where we get shitty drunk
[2:30:54] sScottyKarate: how dare people enjoy themselves
[2:30:59] kiewies: Real Irish people have disowned American Irish
[2:31:08] saarkhastick: Not Guinness it's usually like Coors Light
[2:31:10] Popicus: 8 More Hero talent trees coming tomorrow
[2:31:10] Softex: how do you get guinness to be green
[2:31:12] bladestitch: Want to be able to crawl back home from my outings with drinks.
[2:31:16] aeson_of_raid_sock: weak beer for big strong manly men
[2:31:19] saarkhastick: Don't fuck with Guinness
[2:31:20] hitchmeister59: IN March everyone is Irish for an excuse to drink. In May they all turn Mexican.
[2:31:23] cabeshpash: lol
[2:31:25] Atomicpanda: the beer isn't weak. we're just too strong. (i'm kidding. it's cringe)
[2:31:29] Deatheran: cringe is your brand
[2:31:37] aeson_of_raid_sock: the Guinness store tour is fantastic
[2:31:41] IanSabrewolfe: Weak beer is purely about government regs and profit.
[2:31:43] doomer_dan_: @sScottyKarate to be fair, it's not really about people enjoying themselves. alot of the cringe comes from appropriating another culture's holiday as an excuse to binge drink
[2:31:56] Metket: @TaliesinAndEvitel check calender
[2:31:57] kiewies: Just like in June everyone is black for Juneteenth @hitchmeister59 lmao
[2:32:02] twootten: lol@free in the US
[2:32:08] twootten: only corporations are free here
[2:32:14] saarkhastick: There are some really strong beers in the US 8 - 12 or so percent
[2:32:17] twootten: dont you know, corporations are the people here
[2:32:24] caradosailanthus: Oklahoma restricts alcohol content in beer to 3.8%
[2:32:24] cabeshpash: I don't think it's true, a lot of people are watching their calories / don't wanna get super drunk, so they drink watered down beer basically lol
[2:32:24] Merex760: the only "free" part of the US is the ability to buy a gun lmao
[2:32:27] clemdawwwg: clemdawwwg subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! Nothing clever to say today other than all my love! Thanks for the content. You two are the best!
[2:32:33] cabeshpash: there are plenty of strong beers here
[2:32:35] D0LLARST0RE: Freedom to die. So true xD
[2:32:38] IanSabrewolfe: There are, they are all "craft" beers, though.
[2:32:46] twootten: yeah there's tons of strong beer here... people just know us for the shitty stuff like budweiser
[2:32:50] aeson_of_raid_sock: a man isn’t truly free unless he dies from a very preventable illness
[2:32:51] saarkhastick: No, just not as popular
[2:32:54] DrGreatScott: Commercialism tells us we don't need basic necessities~
[2:32:55] caradosailanthus: Just teatotalers and people enforcing their values on others
[2:32:55] Atomicpanda: why sell beer when you can sell water
[2:33:07] Merex760: I mean we have plenty of strong beer. Just not the mass produced stuff
[2:33:07] saarkhastick: Gotta drink low cal low carb beer to be cool. That a freakin IPAs
[2:33:09] xd_pad: people like light beer because they like drinking 10 of them
[2:33:10] twootten: but in a lot of the US, there was abv limits because of the crazy christians who were in charge
[2:33:12] Nulgar: @caradosailanthus what a weak bloodline
[2:33:16] Theorof: Various places have legal limitations on alcohol content.
[2:33:19] bigcowboyg: the staple beers have better commericals
[2:33:19] ButterStains: the tax scales with the alcohol content
[2:33:22] aeson_of_raid_sock: agreed
[2:33:23] Bassel0pe: voodoo ranger all day
[2:33:24] Verlock7: Craft beers ride the fine line of becoming calssified as hard alcohol
[2:33:27] arcaneviolet: Some states have stupid liquor laws. Stores aren't able to sell higher level beers chilled so some companies don't ship to those states.
[2:33:30] crumbler81: -$16K per year for healthcare feelsbadman KKona
[2:33:30] ButterStains: so 10% is taxed twice as much as a 5%
[2:33:34] KeyouiX: i don't drink cheap beer for the taste
[2:33:34] Bassel0pe: not all day but y'know
[2:33:40] twootten: lots of good beer in charlotte
[2:33:42] aeson_of_raid_sock: we have amazing craft beers here
[2:33:50] netonkent: Cools is more  watery than water
[2:33:53] KeyouiX: Asheville is good for beer in NC
[2:33:56] saarkhastick: Wegmans is so awesome
[2:34:03] xd_pad: cant play beer pong with an imperial stout
[2:34:05] kiewies: Asheville is such a cesspool
[2:34:06] twootten: there's a food hall thing in charlotte that has a bar by this brewery Fonta Flora. you should check it out, very very good
[2:34:09] clemdawwwg: North Carolina has a lot of good breweries too. Especially in western NC like Asheville area.
[2:34:09] arcaneviolet: In Oklahoma you can buy a corkscrew at the same place you buy wine. I know they're changing laws though.
[2:34:14] Nerraw3: @thunduz Thanks for the gifted sub! You're amazing!
[2:34:15] ButterStains: Asheville has a ton of craft breweries, well worth the visit
[2:34:15] arcaneviolet: Cabt*
[2:34:21] arcaneviolet: Omigod. Can't*
[2:34:22] Theorof: Craft beers are really the best option.
[2:34:25] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel ready to drink i guess
[2:34:26] saarkhastick: Bible belt states. They want people to be sad
[2:34:32] anaplia: no weirder than our hot food tax
[2:34:34] cabeshpash: @saarkhastick sad and dumb lol
[2:34:46] mctrouts: a lot a weird laws came from our prohibition time.
[2:34:50] caradosailanthus: The US was founding by people looking to be free to enforce their own ideals on others.  That's true American freedom
[2:34:50] clemdawwwg: A good basement temp beer is always a treat, too!
[2:34:51] KyleS07: prohibition hit the US hard.
[2:34:52] IanSabrewolfe: Post Prohibition, there were regs set on ABV and how things were taxed based on it.  Setting the ABV relatively low lets the big companies save money and pay less in taxes.
[2:34:55] hitchmeister59: National brands conform to the most restrictive laws for wider distribution.
[2:35:07] Deatheran: some states apparently banned selling beer on sundays.. what???
[2:35:13] Atomicpanda: we won't even let our citizens on food assistance buy hot food.
[2:35:18] Theorof: They put the no chilled beers to stop drink driving
[2:35:21] saarkhastick: Free to elect shitty representatives
[2:35:23] DrGreatScott: Land of Free Labor
[2:35:23] cabeshpash: the beast thing that came out of prohibition are speak ez style bars, and moonshine LUL
[2:35:24] ArkyteCurse: A big part is the Liquor Store lobby in my state. They pend tons of money lobbying our government to prevent grocery stores from selling cold beer because it will hurt their profits. F*ck the consumer
[2:35:26] Reminii91: "Freedom and Democracy? join the Hell Divers today and bring "freedom" to the bugs and the auto-bots and spread managed democracy in the galaxy!"
[2:35:29] twootten: @Deatheran in my state you cant buy till after 12:30... because church on sundays
[2:35:33] bigcowboyg: the land of the free. The home of the ones who benefit
[2:35:33] Merex760: contradiction? What's that KKona
[2:35:37] scorm93: @TaliesinAndEvitel believe me, many of us see the irony too.
[2:35:39] stonespetty: It's the land of the free for the rich only.
[2:35:42] TheDeekins: the Free part only applies to businesses and corporations
[2:35:43] kiewies: I have to drive to the next town over to buy alcohol on a Sunday.
[2:35:45] Nulgar: it's always the stupid (and more or less christofascist) decisions of the past that stay around to keep America at the bottom
[2:35:46] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel I don't get it ether I usually drink my beer at room tempature
[2:35:53] doomer_dan_: free for me but not for thee
[2:35:58] IanSabrewolfe: Free... if you are a MegaCorp or RichAF.
[2:36:01] Bassel0pe: its all corpo bs at this point
[2:36:08] saarkhastick: In my state they can't sell beer in liquor stors
[2:36:12] caradosailanthus: 21 for cigarettes in most places now too
[2:36:14] cabeshpash: lol
[2:36:15] clemdawwwg: It IS insane. Can vote. Can marry. Can go to war. BUT DON'T YOU HAVE A BEER!
[2:36:23] CrossroadsDealer: 18 to die in war, 21 to drink a beer
[2:36:25] cabeshpash: tbf British had slaves too
[2:36:28] arcaneviolet: Some beer companies require their beer he constantly chilled. So they won't sell to stores in certain states.
[2:36:38] DrGreatScott: I mean, we don't tax churches but some of them make bank and don't give back to the community they supposedly serve. Not all do this I'm sure, but there are plenty examples
[2:36:48] lonesomecowboy: oh sorry mods
[2:36:51] filthy_gaming2024: @TaliesinAndEvitel is the weekly reset up yet?
[2:36:51] ArkyteCurse: 21 law is to line police department pockets  especially in college towns. They hand out "underage drinking" tickets like candy
[2:36:51] ButterStains: it used to be 18, states were forced into 21+ to receive federal funding for infrastructure
[2:36:56] SadSleepyGirlGaming: can't smoke until 21 either!
[2:37:02] KeyouiX: sounds like the placard was made drunk
[2:37:14] beaconstar313: I wonder what country most slave holders descended from? Cough.
[2:37:21] Rico_Azzarash: Ahahaha xD
[2:37:21] clemdawwwg: Hahaha sounds like a deal.
[2:37:22] thunduz: YAY!!!
[2:37:24] kiewies: We're not allowed to sell liquor in grocery stores, so most alcohol you'll find in our groceries is beer and wine and hard seltzees
[2:37:26] hyzenthlays: wont you watch it with us lol
[2:37:27] DrGreatScott: LETS GO!
[2:37:28] cabeshpash: if you wanna make a lot of money, and not get taxed start a religion LUL
[2:37:33] Sockfire: Excellent
