[0:52:28] Sleepypan: ur math seems a little off @silva53 KEKW
[0:52:34] oSeeks: thats kinda how games work there are just the best class and in competition you gotta use the best
[0:52:41] naphelas: i think we are going to see really big junkyard keys
[0:52:42] datadietz: I'm grinding out Draenor pathfinder while I watch this
[0:52:43] pisceslonewolf: @Lonely_TTV Aha. Well prob useful in world content but really silly for a competitive m+
[0:52:46] dzwen: @nezz231 intense fighting and there's a nasty delay beetween the casters
[0:52:50] PrinceLuTen: it was donuts
[0:52:53] baseboned: people malding about man dungeons only having 5 people in them, geez the wow community is whinny
[0:52:58] RastaDino: @silva53 thats always going to be the case. Theres always going to be a best tank, healer, and dps
[0:53:04] zyuranger: These casters other than Nagurra need to learn broadcasting etiquette
[0:53:09] Prophet001: who is donuts and disbaer

[0:53:11] tcheetoz: Chat, did ambition just timed the 30?
[0:53:13] pisceslonewolf: @baseboned no
[0:53:15] moderatygos: there is a small delay for the casters with natural latency so the interrupts are not intentional
[0:53:17] blackmaija: ah casual 3 chesting a +26 :D
[0:53:20] datadietz: @baseboned nobody hates wow like wow players
[0:53:22] MBG_95: Oldge timer is suppperr good compared to the other runs

[0:53:35] ArnesMeyer: ambition already in mechagon yard
[0:53:48] oSeeks: ikr i play mm and im doing the same damage close to surv but they just have a better tool kit
[0:53:50] pisceslonewolf: @baseboned For good reason.
[0:54:03] CozyWoW: Can Ambition make up for that?
[0:54:10] baseboned: lmao, good reason, sure buddy
[0:54:10] datadietz: no good reason to mald about a game.

[0:58:08] Sleepypan: lol
[0:58:15] elsaho: Why ambition on 26 did they do something else before ?

[2:07:41] kraiser1624: I think the hpal choice is for damage via shock bots, like when holy priest is healing, or has to heal rigorously, like on gunker, hpal can keep doing damage via melee/crusader strike and still heal, than priest, which has to cast heals/flash heals/words to heal, and may not be able to dish out as much globals on damage to proc shockbots
[2:07:52] Wildfury16: @iPsyop Clearly not on 34

[2:13:02] czamp: @blackmaija the small icon on their health bars
[2:13:06] hitzocrunk: @blackmaija The icon for each buff is different, they are all running haste cos it scales with the shock bots
[2:13:35] lirly__: Dorki eats 34s for breakfast
[2:13:47] blackmaija: yeah i was mostly thinking that going for vers if stuff starts to oneshot, since damage has not seem to be a problem so far

[2:15:16] Swgam12: Huh JPC is playing necro outlaw
[2:15:18] die_sumpfranze22: they are running a lot of verse on gear, because TR has no avoidance. verse from affix is just inefficient, because it only gives half the stats than the other options
[2:15:26] catboysanji: OLDGE LETS GO
[2:15:31] popCatter: blood dk is a 4th dps, 2nd healer and also cant die
[2:15:36] RaegnKinthyr: also I think avoidance not on tourney realm factors in too
[2:15:43] MorteDeAngelis: @Ontarin92 Only tank that can run Gavel and Gavel is dumb damage

[2:49:35] CrerisRs: @Sleepypan ye but not because they couldnt time higher, just cant get the keys. Kinda important to point that out
[2:49:48] CrerisRs: @Holysal aggregation does not mean averaging
[2:50:10] Holysal: @CrerisRs oops then
[2:50:15] enclavearmour: Once both Tidemistresses have been defeated, or if the boss is brought to 45% health, phase four begins. The raid should aim to defeat both Tidemistresses before triggering phase four, as otherwise they will need to damage them to finish them off which is damage you’d rather have on the boss.
[2:50:26] blackmaija: aggregation can just mean a sum

[3:19:18] Sleepypan: @Sleepypan i dont know I question my mental status
[3:19:20] ConcernedGaming: @Extrema_DK It means how many key levels the dungeon will increase when you complete it. So if you Three Chest. Your Key goes from a +15 to a +18
[3:19:29] scilla3497: @Extrema_DK If you finish with a lot of time left your keystone goes up an extra level or two. Used to be you got more loot as well (which is where the chest name came from)
[3:19:30] RaccoonJS: @Lonely_TTV -.-

[3:35:26] moderatygos: @l3lack_Dragon i pugged a lot of 20s last season with a non-meta spec and my pugs were generally non-meta comps so
[3:35:31] SerMitten: Oh, haven't played seriously since 9.1 I think, good for them
[3:35:37] scilla3497: @LGhost Elle did pally for two of his junkyards

[3:36:38] Norfall: @l3lack_Dragon BM is also often seen as a noob spec. It's not because the spec itself is terrible, but it caters to bad players, sadly. this is not memeing on you, btw.
[3:36:49] RecoilOce_: LUL i was joking and he knows how rude mods

[3:37:14] Sleepypan: i did 3k last season as bm just chilling so that was what all 20s?
[3:37:16] gamergirl4182: @ask_peter 2 teams got eliminated

[3:37:54] Toorps_: @l3lack_Dragon I play a DH, i know how you feel. People writing "Lock/SV" behind a +15 key is actually so dumb

[3:40:52] ask_peter: @Thdlock u cannot limit chat by *** > 100. that means only those we are watching can chat and they are playing a tournament right now.
[3:40:59] Norfall: @l3lack_Dragon keep in mind then, that seeing as you've been hardcore maining a specific class/spec combo, your views are highly biased. i don't know what RIO you're sitting at or have been previously.

[3:42:43] Norfall: @Sleepypan another point in time is pretty irrelevant. BM was super good at the tail end of BFA. it sort of needs to be current content to use as an argument.

[3:44:54] Norfall: @Sleepypan BM was a top 5% spec in the end of BFA, not sure how that is not considered meta. BM wasn't great in legion, i agree. yea people making a fuss about spec below 25 is pointless.
[3:44:56] endobleedz: they lost yesterday
[3:45:01] Sleepypan: @endobleedz im pretty sure even ferals can do 20+ literally any class/spec can. the people in chat arent doing 30+

[3:46:05] Sleepypan: @Norfall i was specifically talking abouit Legion wasnt saying anything about BFA i know they were meta end end of BFA. Maybe i worded things wrong haha :P
[3:46:13] Partomen: Dratnos is such a math god. He is not only in the present, but has already mathematically calculated every single theoretical possibility this entire competition. It is no longer known as a gigachad, it is now a gigadratnos

[3:47:55] aavegotchi1221: @Gritalian i hate them too :P
[3:48:02] raikoneN_: if you dont need the 3 stacks, skip the mob for consistancy for sure, just to get a higher succes rate and a better chance on going to the next key or ?
[3:48:07] Grrmondays3or: Is it possible to see gear talents and souldbinds of ehat they are running  somewhere ?

[3:56:51] endobleedz: not as broken as bdk
[3:56:58] Drekthul_: @purrzoned Agreed 1000%
[3:57:13] ARROOCE: @purrzoned wtf is that logic OMEGALUL
[3:57:16] Darkduprey: @purrzoned Except in most teams the other dps class are also pure dps classes so what's your point?
[3:57:20] Killerinstinct45: you could say the same thing for rogue.....
[3:57:27] defiaux: Is there a way to see overall dps for previous runs?
[3:57:44] endobleedz: demo will do just about the same amount of dps lol
[3:57:44] EyeofNewt_: @ARROOCE what do you mean it has one job and if it cant do that its useless
[3:57:46] jundarer: hybrid tax hasn't existed since tbc and is not even an argument

[3:58:14] ARROOCE: @EyeofNewt_ I cant tell if youre trolling or not
[3:58:22] Slaen: @purrzoned So by your logic, druids and monsk should be nerfed to the ground and kept there?
[3:58:28] Darkduprey: Besides hybrid classes are not a thing in WoW, once you chose a DPS spec you are a pure dps so yeah, whatever
[3:58:46] pcort: @purrzoned they are tho Kappa
[3:58:54] endobleedz: @JustSlaen  druids are lol
[3:59:09] Drekthul_: @purrzoned Don't even try explaining that pure dps classes should excel at, you know, dpsing...
[3:59:13] Loop7: @Darkduprey So WW monks /ferals/ rets cant heal them self - then makign them hybrids? LOL ok
[3:59:21] Slaen: @endobleedz Was just about to say that KEKW
[3:59:23] Darkduprey: @purrzoned Lmaooo yeah sure it has nothing to do with how your statement was totally wrong in the first place, it's because "people are quick to hate"
[3:59:24] moderatygos: guys keep it civil
[3:59:27] Killerinstinct45: hunters, rogue & mages are pure dps & locks still destroy them all. your point makes no sense 😕

[4:00:39] SwaggWaggon: @jundarer kennyp8MinkMonk
[4:00:48] Darkduprey: @Loop7 That's just classes gimmicks not "hybrid classes", with actual hybrids classes you could take two hybrids healers and they would keep the group alive, which is perfectly impossible to do

[4:03:15] Kanine: 35 yard jesus
[4:03:19] spectrashock: @rokemon because there's still more time in the day, having the tiebreaker is still relevant if they can catch up the one point
[4:03:19] GUY_IN_CHAT_xdd: no frozen peaches in this chat sadge

[4:03:29] SwaggWaggon: @EternalWulf yes

[4:04:07] Drekthul_: @JustSlaen Yes Kappa

[4:04:17] worthtv: @JustSlaen Echo wont win TGP

[4:04:43] reggiepowa: @JustSlaen they didnt win previous tgp and they werent even close so I dont think they are favorites
[4:04:44] Slaen: @Drekthul_ Another trophy to the shelf b)
[4:04:44] ModeraYsera: @ahv__ They have around 1hr 24mins
[4:04:49] Doomgoroth: @EternalWulf because it is first about key levels and only then about time

[4:05:01] spectrashock: @Drekthul_ if ambition gets another point they're ahead sure, but if disbear gets 32 streets and ambition can't get another point,t hen they win on tiebreaker

[4:05:16] wuggi_tv: 30?
[4:05:27] ModeraYsera: @NETRAV3R EU is next weekend
[4:05:41] EternalWulf: @EternalWulf But both have 182 aggregate key levels? Or is it like left-to-right in terms of highest key level per dungeon?
[4:05:45] NETRAV3R: ok
[4:05:56] IronXen: who are the casters right now?
[4:06:00] Ignite_CLO: @worthtv they only lost because they had two NA players on the team Kappa
[4:06:03] rokemon: @Drekthul_ yeah like i said that would assume ambition isn't capable of doing anything in an hour 15 minutes and donuts can
[4:06:04] moderatygos: meeix and tettles
[4:06:06] cassiahh: @worthtv  they didnt play full team. It was with jpc and onezy
[4:06:07] Drekthul_: @bwps_ Yeah, that's what I meant. However, both teams will have enough time to try and push another key, i.e. Ambition going for Upper and Disbear going for Lower
[4:06:22] Clairfoyance: extra week practise for EU, typical LUL
[4:06:29] Sebleh: @omniscientautoma Meeixles NODDERS
[4:06:33] worthtv: @cassiahh There's no full team this year either. Fragnance is out, merees isn't coaching and is plaiying instead, your point?

[4:07:31] Raukier: so two teams get eliminated today?
[4:07:40] Slaen: I already completed Kara many years ago :)
[4:07:41] Drekthul_: @rokemon Both of them can push more, for sure, I personally think Ambition has the upper hand just because of how much time is left. Disbear can go for 29 Lower and 32 Streets (kinda possible with time they had on 31), and Ambition can do Upper + something else, idk. They're close, it's pretty cool how close they are
[4:07:42] moderatygos: correct
[4:07:51] moderatygos: top 2 advance to the finals
[4:07:51] ChipJiggins: @Raukier yep

Should he succeed in anchoring the structure to the myriad of worlds held by the Legion, the Dark Titan's army will overrun Azeroth and leave little more than a smoldering husk.
[4:19:24] Remireee: we killed malchezzar in "technically" twisting nether which means he's dead dead
