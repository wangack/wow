[0:44:10] the_tavern_dwarf: hey @anniefuchsia What is you're opinion fore the 1 year subscription for wow ??
[0:44:12] BG_Paku: it is a server vs server competition
[0:44:15] Taylor131313: COCKBedge ?
[0:44:19] Kungfujo23: I think each time has their own servers. 4 teams 4 servers first to achieve the objectives.

[0:44:53] Morgonbladet: You can mount it as ground mount in wotlk tho
[0:44:54] NoName6834: people will buy expansion and 1 years sub then quit after a month LUL
[0:44:57] Taylor131313: I think most people won't buy it for the wotlk mount LUL
[0:44:58] Chryterion: The discount should have been more
[0:45:11] Lorrdzik: yea I know that I will play classic or DF
[0:45:14] PanicRush: Sadge

[0:45:20] the_tavern_dwarf: thats what i tought but he mound looks nice

[0:45:32] Valaeriia: Defo not a whale, and I fell for the gigachad murloc trap monkaSTEER
[0:45:33] Taylor131313: I really don't like paying wow sub that much in advance, if a patch is awful like 9.1 I will probably unsub and don't want to feel like I wasted money
[0:45:44] PanicRush: @Valaeriia D: they got you
[0:46:05] Valaeriia: @Valaeriia They did, save yourself fren!
[0:46:19] WTFHali: i wish that the ppl that pay monthly got incentives like the pre subbers :/

[0:46:23] indestructible: hi annie
[0:46:34] Krozzyfix: then it would be too cheap tho
[0:46:39] PanicRush: @Valaeriia i am safe EZ i mean, i dont have dragonflight yet so i am certainly not buying something 3 times more expensive LUL
[0:46:40] Taylor131313: it's still 100+ though
[0:46:40] Krozzyfix: you pay for commitment
[0:46:54] PixlOni: YEP just sell your organs
[0:47:04] Krozzyfix: yeah its essentually just a cheaper wow sub
[0:47:05] Mickur: And I just got the 6-month one...
[0:47:07] Krozzyfix: bad business
[0:47:21] Krozzyfix: bliz
[0:47:23] grotevlieger: monthly payment thats non-declinable

[0:47:39] Makkan780: msot people won't actually play all of those months
[0:47:43] NoName6834: $155.88 peepoWTF
[0:47:43] Sne4ky79: Is that a new switch controller on the shelf annie? Pog
[0:47:50] LoremasterMarthan: To me, the value of a 1 year sub feels entirely dependant on how confident you are in the product to say you will consume the product enough in the next year to get your money's worth.
[0:47:50] Taylor131313: it's not bad business for blizzard, so many people will quit shortly after the new expansion releases but still have an active sub because of this
[0:48:22] Aegis_2566: If they decide to buy it
[0:48:22] Koppakamarin: YEP I do this for FFXIV
[0:48:27] PixlOni: monkaHmm sometimes I get some shady vibes from Blizzard ....
[0:48:28] NoName6834: peepoGiggle
[0:48:33] Valaeriia: I paid for the 1 year - they changed my account to a trial version KEKW True story
[0:48:43] Sne4ky79: yeah true
[0:48:58] SirHallowed: They must not have faith in df
[0:48:58] Aegis_2566: The fact that you dont even get a discount for owning some of the products makes it very weird
[0:49:00] NoName6834: $155.88
[0:49:06] Kungfujo23: That is a steep price.
[0:49:10] Koppakamarin: It's expensive to be poor NODDERS
[0:49:12] lukeng89: ouchs thats a lot
[0:49:16] Taylor131313: I have it, but I don't want to feel like I have paid for something I might not like in 6 months
