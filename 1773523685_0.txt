[6:14:27] meady: I love being op on my ret lol
[6:14:40] justjoshingyo: hunters kill any class spec race with 3 globals. 1 aimed shot with free 80k arcane shots  rapid fire and kill shot
[6:14:41] Airwaive: @Pallyofhell is that what the wishing tree told you
[6:14:51] justjoshingyo: thats not nerfted...
