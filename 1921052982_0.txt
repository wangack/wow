[1:00:13] TheItalianStallion321: lol no problem buddy!
[1:00:13] Molvonos: @TheItalianStallion321 Yea, they're only really shifting it.  The whole 'Reverse Execute thing was good to a point, but the dropoff if you goof your rotation was too big, I guess.  So they're streamlining the damage. Should be interesting to see where it goes.
[1:00:37] Thdlock: sometimes u just wake up at 6 am catch a lost ark insane cgi trailer to start off the day
[1:00:40] Thdlock: its always a great time
[1:00:45] TheItalianStallion321: @Molvonos very much so. giving a 5% dmg buff may not really change much but we will see
[1:00:45] Thdlock: EZ
[1:01:15] RoboMaximillion: waste of time
[1:01:33] Molvonos: @TheItalianStallion321 The leggo proc is pretty unique compared to the procs of the weapons.  For Deva, yea, I can understand that since it's not a raw dps proc, but for Pre and Augvokers, it's a matter of utility.
[1:01:45] ForgottenTime: I was gonna say I saw you in maxs streams last night when I passed out and your here now too lol
[1:02:03] TheItalianStallion321: @Molvonos i never really looked into it. does it proc enough though?

[1:54:42] TheItalianStallion321: then there was antorus?
[1:54:49] dracullus: @Towelliee I have theory they may use Nighthold as raid for S4
[1:55:00] luckfore: yea only last raids give aotc mounts
[1:55:04] mavericks312: unless its a ruby sanctum type raid where its not a major raid
[1:55:06] manmower: fated raid
[1:55:06] valianya: End,  Moose, Birb, Robocar
[1:55:21] oticai: is fyrakk really gonna be the last boss of the entire expansion? seems unlikely, is iridikron gonna carry over to next expac then?
[1:55:24] Molvonos: Antorus didnt give a mount.  It gave a pet
[1:55:26] FatChase: I reckon they'll do another S4 shadowlands where they do fated raids
[1:55:42] Shalamyne: no, but they could just want to reward people to do the raid
[1:55:52] TheItalianStallion321: @Molvonos gothca
[1:55:55] TheItalianStallion321: or gotcha
[1:55:56] xziyn: @Molvonos It gave a mount
[1:56:01] dracullus: they would just say it in interview
[1:56:03] Molvonos: Nope
[1:56:05] xziyn: There was
[1:56:09] dracullus: there was, some bird
[1:56:14] luckfore: yes a pink bird aotc reward
[1:56:15] Artiiz: the purple rukhmar mount
[1:56:24] valianya: Legion gave Moose from drop item quest
[1:56:25] TheItalianStallion321: and i swore gul'dan dropped a mount as well
[1:56:25] xziyn: Yeah purple bird
[1:56:28] dracullus: always last raid has AotC mount that goes away with prepatch
[1:56:31] TheItalianStallion321: unless it was just mythic gul'dan
[1:56:35] Artiiz: @valianya no that was wod
[1:56:40] manmower: those must be for the revamped scarab lord
[1:56:45] mavericks312: 10.2 said we ehard you like collecting
[1:56:54] luckfore: @TheItalianStallion321 not for aotc just a regular drop
[1:57:28] DunzoCD: DK sets lookin good
[1:57:29] TheItalianStallion321: @luckfore ok
[1:57:47] Shalamyne: I mean Blizzard also aren't really giving a straight answer to if this is the final raid of the xpac, usually they have been pretty clear right?
[1:57:53] mikejensenn24: Shaman mythic set look good with the red wolfs
[1:58:03] cipusanx: am i the only one that does not like the glows or other vfx on the gear?

[1:59:02] PvtHudson093: Shaman set is up on wowhead
[1:59:16] RagingPunk: i hope they revamp things in next xp
[1:59:35] dracullus: but this time it will be likely full 5 month season
[1:59:57] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos no urzul was the mythic drop not aotc aotc was the arcane bird
[2:00:20] botscast: people need to do the math, there isnt enough time to do another raid+fated season till next expac which will prolly be around the anniversary

[2:00:37] Ribastur0075: so no more X.3 patches?
[2:00:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: It takes a ton of work to create another raid
[2:01:03] mavericks312: @Ribastur0075 yes but 10.3 will most likely be a dinar season
[2:01:46] justagamingfiend: Fated raids and Timewalking emerald nightmare are my guess

[2:02:45] dracullus: you think we will get roadmap on Blizzcon or later?
[2:03:20] RoboMaximillion: sheesh
[2:03:38] oticai: if this is last raid, blizzcon will reveal next expansion rather than next patch?
[2:03:44] mavericks312: damn we getting mythic gear in LFR thats not bad
[2:04:06] mavericks312: @oticai 100% blizzcon is next xpac announcement
[2:04:10] Rudric_Ice: @oticai there is no next patch
[2:04:54] Shalamyne: @oticai you don't know that, its all speculation if this is the last patch
[2:05:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP crafted gear
[2:05:07] DunzoCD: thats fine you didnt need to craft full top end mythic, a few ilvls below for tailored stats is still nice
[2:05:08] CDubTheRIPper: patch notes? cohzPC
[2:05:14] TheItalianStallion321: YES ALT FRIENDLY

[2:06:10] manmower: ilevel 500+ in 10.3 raid?
[2:06:17] mavericks312: 10.2 doesnt seem like a terrible gearing patch so far either
[2:06:21] Thoreya: @smokedbaconx LUL
[2:06:23] TheItalianStallion321: @smokedbaconx fantastic take. good job
[2:06:27] xkayne: hes not wrong

[2:06:43] TheItalianStallion321: @xkayne awesome input. good job.
[2:06:46] Thoreya: @xkayne LUL
[2:06:56] Molvonos: And yes, fundamentally, you're both wrong, since it's an opinion.
[2:06:58] DunzoCD: @xkayne troll
[2:07:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: The sparks are starting early in 10.2, but you only get another every two weeks

[2:07:13] Shalamyne: @mavericks312 Yeah but too be fair, blizzard has changed up so much shit this xpac, they can start giving aotc a reward like how mythic+ has one every season

[2:08:35] ShrenTheOrc: wood finish on everything lol
[2:08:46] JanCameraman: towHAMUP
[2:08:55] Thoreya: those are cool
[2:08:57] Molvonos: @Shalamyne What exactly would you consider a 'end boss' of an expansion involving dragons and elements?
[2:08:58] mavericks312: @Shalamyne idk who you think would be the final boss cause iridikron is going into atleast 11.0
[2:09:03] xziyn: DF has been insane with outdoors gear tbh
[2:09:08] LearnedSomething: I like the hearthmaul design
[2:09:28] mavericks312: @xziyn DF has just been a good xpac in general
[2:10:03] mavericks312: mythic has the shadowflame feel to it
[2:10:32] Bugszy: Bugszy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[2:11:00] xziyn: Yeah, only the story felt a bit mid, the rest has been great
[2:11:08] StormshoutS: Are you going pally or Warrior next raid tier?
[2:11:11] oticai: @mavericks312 i agree with shalamayne, fyrakk as the final boss of the expac seems weak compared to iridikron, random sadistic fire dragon is last boss
[2:11:26] DunzoCD: love these mogs, we had alot of this style from ardeweald but it was all blue, ive been wanting other colors
[2:11:37] Thoreya: weapons/mounts look hella nice this patch
[2:11:38] ShrenTheOrc: is the sxe legendary a red fire version of broxigars axe?
[2:11:40] Molvonos: @oticai You do realize that's because Iridikron's actually made to be intelligent and will be revisited as a big boss in the next expansion?
[2:11:41] mavericks312: @oticai what exactly does a final boss feel like?
[2:11:42] Thoreya: art team stepping up
[2:11:47] ShrenTheOrc: axe
[2:11:55] Bugszy: those fist weapons look sick
[2:11:58] Shalamyne: @Shalamyne Iridikron is there unless they decide to make him a next xpac villian, It justs my opinion just this patch feels like a middle piece to setup the endgame of the story for the xpac
[2:11:59] Jarlan23: maybe i have bad taste but i really like the warrior tier
[2:12:05] Jarlan23: i like  more plain looking armor always have
[2:12:07] Skars111: man im so excited for this season? so much cool stuff? or is it just me?
[2:12:10] zorantt: What was the one before the guns? I thought that was the glaives
[2:12:16] DunzoCD: blood DK GIGACHAD
[2:12:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: A lot of boomkins out there
[2:12:39] mavericks312: @Shalamyne there is going to be story in 10.3, just not a new raid
[2:12:42] oticai: @mavericks312 they feel like jailer, nzoth, argus, archimonde, heavy hitters basically
[2:12:43] xziyn: @Shalamyne Tbf, the whole expansion feels like a transition story-wise
[2:12:44] StormshoutS: Are you going Pally or Warrior next raid tier? Have you decided yet?
[2:13:07] StormshoutS: Nice!
[2:13:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess that unholy DK's will be in the raids again, with aug evoker buffing them they seem so strong

[2:13:39] mavericks312: @oticai i disagree its a nice change of pace to have a psycho crackhead death lover as a final boss
[2:13:46] xziyn: Hope they sheathe properly
[2:14:00] itsSammwiseG: which tanks do you think will be good for m+?
[2:14:02] lumaday: Yeah i was kinda disappointed when i saw in wowhead

[2:14:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Thrash is great for mythic+, true
[2:15:01] Artiiz: do you have link to the new sets?
[2:15:06] Artiiz: the tier bonuses
[2:15:08] magenof: havent played in 5 years, whats the most fun tank to play these days chat?
[2:15:09] Douchecakes: we lose dps but get more "tanky"
[2:15:29] PvtHudson093: return of the monk if you dont have one for mythic prog
[2:15:42] Shalamyne: @mavericks312 Yeah, i mean i expect that, its just everything is on speculation. there is no source that says directly from Blizzard that this is the final raid/major patch. If it is, then ok cool. I personal just don't see it.
[2:15:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah WoWhead has the new tier set bonuses pinned in one of the things
[2:15:53] ScurvyHyam: Thats an amazing sword
[2:15:54] Savvasthekiler: hey man, how's it going?

[2:16:37] SFGranis: I got it on retail today, its so fucking annoying
[2:16:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not a fan of bear's tier set relying on rage of the sleeper, but some people love it
[2:16:52] EtherealFidelity: had a addon causing it for me so i deleted em and was fine, not this bad of lag though
[2:16:59] Jarlan23: you try the challenge mode races on live? some of em are hard af
[2:17:06] Savvasthekiler: you planning on playing Starfield today?

[2:26:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: With FFXIV you do want to keep in mind that the starting stuff is old, and the expansions update things later on
[2:26:10] CertainVII: Still playing Wayfinder? @Towelliee

[2:32:19] herzlustafir: hello good ppl
[2:32:27] CyphexEU: Any news on UI improvements in 10.2?
[2:32:29] wastedxtime93: @imrevod if you're in the Dragon Isles I would do it just for the story alone, but if you're leveling from scratch go thru chromie time and let everything scale to you. That way at 58 you can go straight to DI.

[2:35:28] imrevod: yeah, you can die for something stupid even in higher leve, because most of those deaths are user fault
[2:35:34] imrevod: level*
[2:35:48] Tokesito: i think they fixed tht
[2:36:01] manmower: just res and try again, no big deal
[2:36:25] wastedxtime93: I've just never been a fan of one life things, BRs, HC runs, Gears 1 and 2 shotty elims. Search and Destroy was okay with friends back in like 2007/2009.

[2:37:53] thomssone: its different because its a job for the other one
[2:37:58] imrevod: yeah but imagine a casual player, not like a streamer and die at level 60, thats so much
[2:37:59] wastedxtime93: I can't even play PTR cause imma already do it again on at least one alt, but dying and losing everything, nah, I'm good lmao
[2:38:12] Verdell263: Got a Mage to 30, died, and uninstalled Classic lol
[2:38:34] imrevod: KEKW
[2:38:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure it takes the average player weeks and weeks and months to level up high
[2:38:36] Tokesito: I feel like if u not making an income outta hc classic like only a portion of streamers and other content creators, you are just wasting ur time
[2:38:42] imrevod: but is true
[2:38:46] imrevod: its "your" job
[2:38:47] imrevod: you know
[2:38:59] gassygatinho: Wish they take some time to develop universal training grounds where you can take all the raid buffs bloodlust and power infusion
[2:39:17] gassygatinho: A properly test
[2:39:18] Merkkinz: it takes forever too bc it's so packed
[2:39:29] Roaringkittylol: Could make HC pop off harder by reducing the leveling time.
[2:39:38] wastedxtime93: I would gladly take compensation for repeated deaths lmao.

[2:52:55] mavericks312: @Wulfgrym for me its a good story but it may not even be the best MS story
[2:53:00] abracka_: good mornin towHAMUP
[2:53:03] Wulfgrym: @mavericks312 definitely a top 3.
[2:53:04] shardrum: towLove
[2:53:12] whyyoudolikethat: :p
[2:53:21] whyyoudolikethat: just look at gear xd
[2:53:32] whyyoudolikethat: trinkets etc
[2:53:43] wastedxtime93: Never played a druid before but def gotta level one now.
[2:53:45] mavericks312: @Wulfgrym for me maybe like 5 or 6 early halo and gears stories still top it imo
[2:53:48] tbakm: I heard Xavius is coming back =D
[2:53:57] Thoreya: They need to add m+
[2:54:07] Wulfgrym: @mavericks312 yeah i know theres are some really good ones out there, but i haven't played them all, so i don't want to say the best ever for everyone, but i felt it was really good. Overall  the quest stories in the game are so well done.
[2:54:12] wastedxtime93: Anything after Halo 3 was meh
[2:54:13] mavericks312: @Wulfgrym also oblivion and skyrim
[2:54:45] mavericks312: @Wulfgrym its a solid game for sure
[2:54:59] Wulfgrym: @mavericks312 yeah i really didn't play much halo and or mass effect much so i can't speak to those

[2:55:10] whyyoudolikethat: towelliee you saw plate armor yet ? if so its nice or ? ^^
[2:55:14] mavericks312: @wastedxtime93 but halo 1-3 is goated same as gears 1-3
[2:55:33] zeeAbe: What we doink over here
[2:55:41] Wulfgrym: @mavericks312 my pick for game of the year was baldur's gate 3, now I feel personally Starfield is the game of the year
[2:56:20] wastedxtime93: @mavericks312 Facts. That was like the pinnacle of gaming imo. Hell, I even enjoyed CoD 4 and MW 2 and their stories back then.
[2:56:21] mavericks312: @Wulfgrym thats cool its still between zelda and bg3 for me until we see SM2
[2:56:34] Wulfgrym: @mavericks312 ill just say its a top 10 story. because gears and halo stories are definitely good ones.
[2:57:05] mavericks312: @wastedxtime93 yea it was also the time of DmC 1 and 2, the early ratchet and clank and jak games as well
[2:57:15] Wulfgrym: @mavericks312 i didn't play zelda but so many solid games right now, i won't be surprised if bg3 still wins it though.
[2:57:16] Bugszy: they are posting about you talking about them lol

[2:57:48] PvtHudson093: better than Fatality
[2:57:53] wastedxtime93: I don't think BG3 will win simply for the turn based. Not sure what could top it's mass positive reviews though. Loving Starfield but at the same it's also generated a lot of hate.

[2:57:56] Melonbrew: Lets have an underwater expansion.
[2:57:58] mavericks312: @Wulfgrym ye aits just hard to call starfield a top 10 all time story when we have amazing stories on sony side and hell just the zelda franchise alone
[2:57:59] zorantt: I thought everyone was waiting for the Dragon Isles expansion? :P
[2:58:00] Verdell263: Ybarra says no Kappa
[2:58:41] wastedxtime93: @mavericks312 my mom was the one that got me into the DmC series, haha. I started on the 2nd one I believe, where you play as a female? Dante was like the most badass character I had ever seen at that time lmao.
[2:58:48] Wulfgrym: @mavericks312 yeah i can only speak for me. i don't expect anyone to feel the same, because I haven't played alot of those games myself, so i can't speak to them. why i say for me only im sure there are equally amazing games
[2:58:49] mavericks312: @wastedxtime93 so the rumored goty picks are bg3,zleda,spider man 2, starfield and FF 16. i got zelda or bg3 taking it easily
[2:59:08] mavericks312: @wulf oh 100%

[2:59:33] mavericks312: @wastedxtime93 its crazy cause ppl actually hated 2 with a passion but i thought it was a good game
[2:59:50] wastedxtime93: Out of those, I'd say Spiderman 2 takes it home. That game is looking really damn good, and the web swinging is just so fluid. Combine that with Venoms powers and it's going to be pretty damn good.
[2:59:57] Wulfgrym: @mavericks312 although the more i think about it. if i look at bg3 as a whole. It probably is still my top pick. the game is so damn good.
[2:59:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Freakin' beacon
[3:00:06] fluh_: make a darksiders 4 prayge
[3:00:21] mavericks312: @wastedxtime93 i would love Sm2 to win goty but ppl forget how much sway nintendo has with voters

[3:01:23] wastedxtime93: Unpopular opinion cause tanks be moving too much, but I miss my wild spirits haha
[3:01:41] whyyoudolikethat: lol i just read the bm hunter 4 set its gonna op as F i think xd
[3:01:47] Wulfgrym: beacon talk too soon LUL
[3:02:02] mavericks312: @wastedxtime93 your also forgetting that kraven is in the game as well and we may actually be able to play as venom
[3:02:19] wastedxtime93: Forget beacon, I'm still farming Sark on like 8 toons a week for that dumb manuscript. Very happy SF Fyrakk is an AoTC thing.

[3:04:00] mavericks312: that DH rework could be huge for tanks
[3:04:04] indigooo: Most of the best raid finder sets are the best

[3:09:04] wastedxtime93: Nothing special, just an AoTC raider myself. Only got Mythic appearances cause of DotI. I was happy with gearing this season tho.
[3:09:05] dracullus: @Nebulizer87 mostly because stupid decision that rares award loot only 1 or 2 a week

[3:09:44] Rudric_Ice: gonna come back to wow after 7 months bcuz of the warrior legendary so im looking foward
[3:09:53] mavericks312: 10.1 is easily the best gearing patch and it aint even close
[3:10:03] Zucchey: I geared to 441 in 3 weeks felt amazing
[3:10:10] Bullypoppin: The only thing I wish they would've done for the current patch or 10.2 is to make the crest account wide I'm sitting on way too much of them on my main compared to my alts
[3:10:14] wastedxtime93: That comment said I was happy with the gearing? lol
[3:10:15] PvtHudson093: Im finally done, i hit 446 ilvl, got M+ portals and Aotc.

[3:10:36] wastedxtime93: @tbakm don't try to justify the game not being able to handle 40 people in one area.
[3:10:43] mavericks312: the gearing nerf isnt even that big of a nerf either
[3:10:46] Verdell263: Yes, BoA crests pls
[3:10:58] dracullus: btw, I was catching up alts to 415 and noticed Zaralek world boss awarded 415 loot EVERY time, is it a bug?
