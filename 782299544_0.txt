[0:06:37] JohnoDaGiant: @Kimdah_ honestly if it wasnt so difficult to make it work for every single country probably yeah
[0:06:48] ReinholdtRanger: Honestly only way to get out of it, is if Twitch and Spotify could integrate and people with an spotify account could hear the music being played on stream...
[0:07:12] Kimdah_: Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music etc.
[0:07:14] ReinholdtRanger: So every viewer connected would count as a "play"
[0:07:16] ReinholdtRanger: yeah
[0:07:19] TastyBama: What time is it where he streams? Lol I didn't expect to see this notification pop up
[0:07:32] ReinholdtRanger: !soon

[0:09:22] Kimdah_: And in my country you even have to pay a special tax on any device that can download/save downloaded (illegal) content
[0:09:47] SubQ: heh
[0:09:49] Kimdah_: Literally translated it's called 'home copy tax'
[0:10:23] specialmass: when will the pre event start, i am bored
[0:10:28] Kimdah_: If you buy a new iPhone for example, you don't just pay the price of the device, and 21% tax, but also the home copy tax.

[2:07:23] RuneMeisterKris: Do Hogger again
[2:07:40] OG_Dacs: Vanhilla leveling was designed this way to slow progression giving devs time to work on other zones and stay ahead of the population.
[2:07:43] Raweo: Hey dude! got a quick question, do you by any chance know anyone i could reach out to, to get a value estimate of a WoW collectible ?
[2:07:44] Zestusuka: pet battles is insane leveling as well

[2:41:57] jeremykh1986: Basically most alliance players especially good alliance players. Either quit playing. Or rerolled horde.
[2:42:07] jeremykh1986: So Alliance side has died out way harder than horde side on most servers.

[2:46:31] Aquadriel: it was KEKW
[2:46:33] RuneMeisterKris: So the CW episodes are all out of order in the timeline
[2:46:33] purfessorplum: bad but still entertaining
[2:46:34] Kromede: u can watch downwards 9 -> 1, doesn't makes sense but u can
[2:46:35] Ezekyler: Jesus fuck Anakin's mom, is what i remember for Phantom Menace

[2:47:12] purfessorplum: there's lots of movies that you could catagorize as bad, but they are still plenty entertaining. I mean hello starship troopers, under siege, and so on.
[2:47:19] cabalish: good morning mr legoman
[2:47:19] BrowneePoints: @Broomba Rogue One says hello
[2:47:20] KaisenSiru: How they developed Maul in Clone Wars was very well done to expand on him, who wasn't meant to be much originally
[2:47:24] postrealitybiased: To quote RLM " You didnt notice, but your brain did"
[2:47:25] chirsen: @Towelliee hey man, what do you think when will blizz give the release date free?

[2:47:34] Dragonsland7: Star Trek is superior, change my mind...
[2:47:34] NBK_Sethus: episode 3 was great
[2:47:40] TheMcNutt: @shadowseph is just trying to incite some nerd rage
[2:47:41] araco2021: where are you leveling
[2:47:46] BrowneePoints: Real Talk: Attack of the Clones is Worse than Phantom Menace but it has more action sequences so people think it's better

[2:50:46] Selkat: After cataclysm when the original zones were remade, a lot were designed for without mounts. Those zones were significantly more xp/hr during BFA. I would assume those zones are still the best Vanilla zones.

[3:03:44] TheExecutionerGaming: Pog Mog
[3:03:48] yushashun: Random Q, the 1h that drops from the headless horsemen is a pretty low drop chance right?
[3:03:53] DecayedmiNt: They increase the cap when they do that
[3:03:55] KingSlayerYotam: just get another account
[3:03:56] KingSlayerYotam: ez
[3:04:03] Aquadriel: dude like 40 of the 10 are useless characters LUL
[3:04:09] toyhutt: They get a set date for Shadowlands yet T?
[3:04:10] Thunderbrew: Deleting a character feels much easier now that leveling is faster
[3:04:10] Aquadriel: of the 50*
[3:04:13] chillmodez: usually when they have new races/class they increase the toon cap
[3:04:18] ImWildrager: I think it is 0,4 % chance for horseman
[3:04:34] tulifau_: those fish def need Nugenix, that low T lmao! @Towelliee
[3:04:35] Reklusion: Fun fact: when they bring out new races/classes they increase the maximum characters per account & realm :)
[3:04:39] TheExecutionerGaming: are we 9.0 now?
[3:04:42] jmn115: that transmog slaps for real
[3:04:42] Patawick: What classes are even left/
[3:04:42] OldManChickenLegs: I’m sure it’s part of his stream character but the store items do go towards helping blizzard with in game stuff
[3:04:43] okanata: @Towelliee what class u want
[3:04:43] laeenaravenholdt: laeenaravenholdt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 30 months. Hot damn
[3:04:44] LyraNyrnis: we might get new specs instead in 10.0
[3:04:44] Moobot: @LAEENARAVENHOLDT with the 30 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[3:04:47] BrowneePoints: I think the game desperately needs a 3rd Mail class
[3:04:48] thedonmegatv: what class though?
[3:04:49] Aquadriel: 10.0 sounds like a perfect expansion for either new class or race (or both)
[3:04:49] okanata: a bard?
[3:04:50] yushashun: Not the mount, meant the sword
[3:04:53] BJofBorg: Battles ready :D
[3:04:59] LilyMinajXO: @Towelliee i like the new leveling in WoW currently, buti still feel like it slows down too much 30 on, and the combat to me doesnt make up for it enough to keep me wanting to power through
[3:04:59] 2MakeMe: they cant even balance classes right now, how are they gonna balance another one

[3:05:14] nicedevill: Resto Demon Hunter
[3:05:14] riggurmortis: Battle's rdy on stream raiders
[3:05:18] Aquadriel: maybe class and race for 10.0, after all on 5.0 we got both a race and a class (MoP) @Towelliee
[3:05:24] Lothawia: True LUL
[3:05:24] lotho_: Tinkerer / Silencer class?
[3:05:27] NILLme: they should redesign the current speccs instead of making more
[3:05:27] TheGaoSora: I just hope for non race related classes... let everyone be any class
[3:05:37] GISP: o/
[3:05:40] Grognakaroo: start reducing specs per class... reduce them all to 2, take demonology and unholy and put them into the Necromancer class... ez... more classes same amount of specs, $90 expansion price no other content just spec rework... ez
[3:05:46] bagyrra: imagine gnome druid xD
[3:05:48] Oriqqs: I mean if the can't balance now why does it matter if they add another
[3:05:57] AgentWhiskeyy: What addons do you find as needed?
[3:05:59] Aquadriel: they should ignore all the crap we want
[3:06:01] yunitoYuniro: Waiting for a 3rd faction
[3:06:03] Aervyper: what class is there even left like what could you make
[3:06:06] Neruan: they could not balance classes in bs eigther that sill didnt deter from dk lol
[3:06:13] Necrom93: Still waiting on a necromancer class :)
[3:06:14] OldManChickenLegs: I’d like to go back to old spec with the points system had more variety but there will always be a meta
[3:06:15] LilyMinajXO: personally i feel like all they need to do is stop frontloading power into the expansions and focus on putting those new buttons into the actual classes and specs

[3:06:20] Thunderbrew: @Oriqqs Most players aren't worried about balance, they just like to play stuff they like to play
[3:06:25] NILLme: id like to see them turn UH DKs into a ranged necromancer spec
[3:06:33] FiberZ_: Wow with 1000 classes would be cool
[3:06:34] VintersRise: Streamraiders battle, please?
[3:06:35] valianya: Bard class
[3:06:46] LilyMinajXO: @Towelliee pretty much agree, thats what i was just saying haha
[3:06:46] mab_music_ttrpg: GIVING DH A ERD SPEC xd
[3:06:50] Bernardo994: i think we should get a new spec for each class
[3:06:54] mab_music_ttrpg: third *
[3:06:54] Casual_Oppa: oh the invasions are up?
[3:07:05] zurdo85XIX: Wo what is the current guesstimate for a SL release date?
[3:07:07] Oriqqs: @Thunderbrew me as well, I was just saying balance will probably never be a thing so I'm all for new classes
[3:07:08] Grognakaroo: just get rid of r/popping from unholy and ill be happy
[3:07:15] Syllvn: Giving more specs to classes would just further dilute them, just make a new class at that point

[3:07:33] Brews_Leee: so is it impossible to farm old raids now with the squish?
[3:07:47] LilyMinajXO: i think they need more combo centric combat as well as a redesign for resources, esp with how mana works in the game
[3:07:57] TheGaoSora: mhm
[3:07:57] Thunderbrew: @Oriqqs There probably isn't a game developer in gaming history that has balance classes. People complain to just complain. I'm sure Blizzard is doing their best.
[3:07:58] Meistarinn96: @Brews_Leee some yes, but most are still soloable
[3:08:03] soopaGreg: it was not complicated and it was good

[3:09:10] Aquadriel: no
[3:09:15] LyraNyrnis: if they add more SL zones it'll be amazing
[3:09:19] LilyMinajXO: @Towelliee i think they are afraid of cutting down on borrowed power because of time investment, but at same time, i feel like alot more people would play A LOT more if you could play more alts easier
[3:09:28] DecayedmiNt: Today would've been launch in US
[3:09:31] Neruan: if it had the same buggs yers it would
[3:09:41] OldManChickenLegs: What level do you get flying with prepatch now
[3:09:44] Funderik: maybe with all the daily tweets from people still crying about something that won't change lol
[3:09:45] LilyMinajXO: especially now that leveling is so quick
[3:09:53] Bernardo994: they need to layoff systems
[3:09:56] CipansR_Ayaya: any wow news today ?
[3:09:58] dylannno1: @GISP jsut google vulpera
[3:09:59] Dolphinwithfeet: When are we thinking they will release ? Mid November ?
[3:10:05] Aervyper: @Towelliee so in shadowlands there is no titanforged or like gear. if your drop is 110 it can't be better right?
[3:10:14] GISP: vulpera?
[3:10:14] LilyMinajXO: i personally think its gonna be a December release lol
[3:10:15] Thunderbrew: Dec 8th is the best guess.
[3:10:25] Dolphinwithfeet: Dec is so far :(
[3:10:41] Aquadriel: but you can also buy socket makers

[3:10:48] GISP: Oh... @dylannno1 0o
[3:10:49] gammacyn: since wotlk?
[3:10:54] Glorithan: With no release date yet, do you still believe it will be launched this year? @Towelliee
[3:10:54] LilyMinajXO: November is the big new game month and it seems like systems are so FUKT that they need more time to fix it
[3:10:56] soysos91: I think we're all hoping it all comes together well now.

[3:11:39] hookkz: i have a feeling that blizz is gonna delay even more which im not even complaining about @Towelliee
[3:11:44] purfessorplum: @Bernardo994 Nope, they gonna rename the game to World of Systems. People have such short attention spans these days and no imagination they need system upon system to keep them engaged.
[3:11:55] kingaces1: What’s the speed chromie time to lvl in?
[3:12:03] Bixster: what playing the game? madness
[3:12:12] Grognakaroo: no, im a heroic raider... but mythic is BiS... i should be able to get mythic BiS as a heroic raider... we should have a system for heroic gear to upgrade to mythic so that i can compete in pvp against mythic raiders... /s /s /s (for those that need the /s)

[3:13:39] Nionamot: I had a ton of fun in PvP at the end of Legion.
[3:13:53] Scojan: WoW would be 100% better imo if they would do more with Mythic Dungeons such as Pos/Negative affixs @Towelliee
[3:13:54] FresheFefe: all this borrowed power stuff is nice for like two expansions. but after a while they should go back and invest more into class gameplay instead of the systems...sry for english

[3:16:27] CatOf9Lives: Night Fae DK LUL
[3:16:40] purfessorplum: Is Holy Pal getting a true viable ranged option? I would like to give holy a try this expac, but sounds like holy is being tuned to a melee only healer?
[3:16:45] Bixster: cant wait for all the guys in trade chat asking "where the shadowlands quest starts" because the didnt get the memo
[3:16:45] mavis316: Do you think it’ll get pushed to early next year? How close is the beta to feeling launchable?
[3:16:56] Warphunter: recently got back into my pally what covenant is looking good for the 3 specs?
[3:16:57] MOLAR305: warrior tank kyrian, pally tank kyrian, dh kyrian
[3:17:10] zealspur: Legion introduced one of the best replayable content of m+dungeon. and end of expansion i spent trying to figure mage challenge for every spec.

[3:17:35] Motivess: @Chipmunkaroo I dont have the mage tower appearances and I think that would be a horrid idea
[3:17:40] Erielle04: @S1appadabass if only
[3:17:43] nocturnal_2195: @isweatpants prot does
[3:17:50] hookkz: yea

[3:17:57] LilyMinajXO: nice, thats one of the things i like about pally in 14
[3:17:58] ribose1982: Hey Towelliee, I am really enjoying playing elemental shamen at the moment. Only discovered as leveling every class. Are they still going to be bad in SL. Im not cutting edge but i raid mythic.
[3:18:17] LilyMinajXO: to be fair though all tanks in 14 have a ranged ability that causes threat for easy pulling
[3:18:19] Grognakaroo: @Motivess i agree with you, im talking nonsense
[3:18:34] xApplemaNx: @beautifulrain you know affl locks are like one of the top ranged dps
[3:18:36] griffdog125: @ribose1982 enh
[3:18:38] CloudKoopa: @ribose1982 Ele isn't 'bad' at the moment - perfectly viable.

[3:19:06] Motivess: I hope they allow to earn them again in a different way, or new appearances @Chipmunkaroo
[3:19:15] amricatt: I am having fun with my spriest. Enhancement shaman, I didn't like so I'm testing elemental.
[3:19:16] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Depending on what they do with warriors until the launch, for now they are crap even though im maining one for SL Kappa
[3:19:17] Motivess: At least mage tower ones
[3:19:19] TheMcNutt: My plan is pally tank first then my Sp
[3:19:23] mojusk: you should do the keeshan a-team questline
[3:19:25] sellen97: How do you get eligable for queing classic dungeons now?
[3:19:26] Wranger246: @Towelliee and @chat whats the best way to track group and raid cds?
[3:19:30] Klatrymadon: I think the whirling dragon punch cooldown was broken for almost all of BfA
[3:19:31] bobbyinhd: @xApplemanx yeah but I am just so tired of it lo

[3:20:37] at1c: Warriors feels off
[3:20:44] sellen97: @hookkz But what exp do you pick? Cata?
[3:20:45] Stonefather: Why play warriors when you can play warriors with magic, aka Paladins and Death Knights
[3:20:49] LilyMinajXO: @Towelliee whats your favorite tank to play in raiding?
[3:20:51] whoisqnx: there is one already, blood dk @Sadotatsu
[3:20:53] at1c: like something is missing

[3:21:04] hookkz: @sellen97 i think towelliee did pick cata yea
[3:21:13] DecayedmiNt: They got destroyed the talent synergy too

[3:21:23] subversv: i like arms
[3:21:32] Grognakaroo: @Sadotatsu thats called DK.... corrupted paladin is just a DK
[3:21:34] LilyMinajXO: @insanity2195 oh thats awesome reminds me of the shield toss in Divinity then

[3:22:42] Neronis: I have to say, I am having a lot of fun with Unholy DK right now.
[3:22:49] LilyMinajXO: i love monk so far, it just feels like an actual unique tank mechanic than im used to
[3:23:06] bagrain: what timeline is he questing in?
[3:23:07] LilyMinajXO: the way stagger works and spreads out the dmg you take as a DoT is pretty interesting to me
[3:23:12] belaham: Hows your hands after all those lego pieces?

[3:29:35] Walsey710: fury is bad, bring back legion :(
[3:29:38] thebakeriscomingforu: prot is 'OK' but not great
[3:29:52] Therman75: whats best guess on release u think?
[3:29:54] gotdatpiff420: warrior by design is in a good place the only thing it needs is number tuning
[3:29:54] NILLme: dance boss got a lot of changes last week
[3:30:07] Neruan: they changes whole abilitys since last raidtest
[3:30:15] CaptainAlkohol: they have a lot of frost mage data for sure Kappa
[3:30:24] TheGaoSora: they're gonna burn themselves hard ><;;
[3:30:25] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Warrior dps is a bit slow at the start of every expansion, we are used to that, but the synergy right now between tallents is a bit off and they need a bit of love
[3:30:33] Stonefather: Honestly you won't know what class is good until the day before Shadowlands release.
[3:30:38] AudioJaq: You think decent likelihood we get a new date this week?
[3:30:38] thebakeriscomingforu: prot pally is great
[3:30:42] a23pk: morning @Towelliee hows it going?
[3:30:47] thebakeriscomingforu: prot warrior is OK
[3:30:49] TheGaoSora: VENGENCE
[3:31:07] marvelous19: is shadowlands gonna release tomorrow?
[3:31:13] CaptainAlkohol: people are already simming shit
[3:31:24] CaptainAlkohol: but tuning isnt done
[3:31:32] CaptainAlkohol: nobody need to play the game for simming though
[3:31:46] Stonefather: Day before might be slightly extreme, but until Blizzard says balancing is done there really isn't a reason to throw a class/spec in the bin
[3:31:50] s_t_o_r_m__: @marvelous19 no
[3:32:02] Rane_Tehp: gooooooooooooood morning everyone :D
[3:32:03] Kelticlore: @marvelous19 there
[3:32:09] CaptainAlkohol: bliz is doing balancing every heroic week of patches
[3:32:12] Stonefather: Well unless the fundemental class design is the problem
[3:32:15] Django_7: are there still 2k gold reward emisseries in pre patch?
[3:32:16] danksly: F :)
[3:32:18] oradros: i was able to do redridge twice on my pally
[3:32:18] Kisswani: it was needed at the time
[3:32:18] Aquadriel: it did for the better
[3:32:19] Karbonn: Warriors historically have been more gear dependent and usually end up scaling up their dps with higher item level gear better than other classes. Unless that's changed.
[3:32:25] Stonefather: If it's just numbers it could literally be changed at any time.
[3:32:25] othraerir: and removed a few mobs :(
[3:32:44] inx___: how many chars did you already level up since pre-patch?
[3:32:45] Kelticlore: @marvelous19 they haven't done prepatch event

[3:39:51] Antdavs24: basically
[3:39:52] Arocian: 2 months is to long

[3:40:21] Novirtue_: how funny would it be "dealyed to Friday" KEKW
[3:40:22] GriffGoodman: they should just drop the event already
[3:40:27] BeatTheDevilOut: for the love of god just don't be bad
[3:40:27] jmadoree: too long or having good content ? imo prioritize good content over having it early
[3:40:33] jasperboy: We all know that weeks and months leading up to an expansion launch is fucking LONG
[3:40:37] WoW_StandalonE: @Towelliee please use Enchanted Fey Dragon store mount with the transmog, its the only way FeelsGoodMan
[3:40:40] glixxster: They have to release to make 2020 financial end of year.
[3:40:40] OlStubbs: I feel like december 8th is a good bet with raid coming out the week after christmas or first week of jan
[3:40:40] Thunderbrew: 1st week of January seems good. Nothing going on holiday wise then.
[3:40:45] NILLme: Rambo PogChamp

[3:41:35] crawcook: I see Blizzard making a 1-2 months delay, a few weeks feels like it wouldn't help them.
[3:41:38] Aquadriel: nice
[3:41:41] Stormin27: The group that John J Keeshan has "Bravo Company" is a bunch of badasses @Towelliee

[3:42:44] marvelous19: Junary is too long
[3:42:47] BoezIRL: yeah you shouldn't fight them

[4:18:14] SirMaldo: who catches you though? is there a computer that DMCA uses or do people scan your videos?
[4:18:18] DragonofWolves: towelliee have you listened to some of the ardenwield tracks? they are a pretty good listen

[4:19:12] idenkaz_: @SirMaldo and it happens in realtime too. scary shit
[4:19:13] swordwindgaming: About the FFXIV thing, I'm reading that streams were muted because the soundtracks are available commercially so thats an automatic copyright strike.
[4:19:17] VarkanosGaming: nov 10th
[4:19:24] Solid0Liquid: @Towelliee microsoft actually modded a real fridge to look like an xbox
[4:19:27] Horuseternal69: 10th niov

[4:20:55] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 820 units were placed on the battlefield.
[4:20:57] Tzarvahl: twitch would have to have a system that tracked how long you played dmca music on stream, and that take away money made from your check for the month during that time
[4:21:01] swordart_19: KEKW
[4:21:06] Kisswani: POGGERS
[4:21:07] Tzarvahl: and then~
[4:21:10] Wolok: so then 12/31 LUL
[4:21:15] nielefs: not next year?
[4:21:15] swordwindgaming: @kisswani I'm reading here that boss music is specifically getting the strikes, and opening cinematic music is grounds for strikes as well.
[4:21:28] chatchadd: the copyright laws are so redic...if you pick up a guitar and play a copyrighted song yourself, you still get de-monitized
[4:21:29] Thoreya: bellular thinks late november
[4:21:37] SAY10z: i always wanted to play wow, but combat style is just completely turns me off, and i have no idea how to find any purpose everytime i start the game :/
[4:21:42] Alienfromger: november would be dumb bcause 2 new consoles
[4:21:44] Khyber_GT: let it keep cooking
[4:21:46] duffluv22: My next hype is for the PS5. I'll wait for WoW
[4:21:47] Aeylid: slootClown
[4:21:48] Tyrandian: What's the link for Stream Raiders? I'm on my phone.
[4:21:55] Kisswani: @swordwindgaming again that's strange . like can't you get the Shadowbringers roll and play it in your FC house or sth ?
[4:21:55] daniel85mg: is Draenor good for a quick level up ofr ally races?
[4:21:58] MrBubzTV: it worries me that the expansion date was postponed, with a no definitive date, so close to what the original release date was.
[4:21:59] Shieldzy: Like a Nick Mercs controller... Scufffed
[4:21:59] s_t_o_r_m__: Atleast I can level some alts on wow in a decent timeline
[4:22:01] Lolwilltv: i really don't understand why people can't wait for a better version of what we are currently playing, like do ya really want this buggy expa to come out in 3 weeks?
[4:22:02] papaPathos: raiding can always be delayed to next year.
[4:22:03] Thunderbrew: January.
[4:22:09] Kreakur: @Towelliee is the battle ready?
[4:22:10] Corver: I'm cool with it if it goes to January
[4:22:13] Affiiance: Just delay the Raid opening until January
[4:22:13] manmower: time to hire some temp workers to finish SL
[4:22:22] Grunton: raids can always be delayed
[4:22:23] Aeylid: jeez like a 9 week prepatch it would be so yikes
[4:22:23] MrGattz: @Towelliee legit when you get a second and you know lula is awake have her check discord
[4:22:23] Thoreya: theyre not pushing it to january NotLikeThis SeemsGood
[4:22:28] Freddye: 2 week in Jan, calling it.
[4:22:29] Kreakur: @Towelliee thx a lot! =)
[4:22:31] Thoreya: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:22:32] dregusx: could they not release it and then delay raid?
[4:22:32] vintersorgSA: I've heard from people in my guild the state of SL is almost laughable right now.
[4:22:32] idenkaz_: January wouldnt be that bad tbh.
[4:22:34] Zevtherev: @manmower probably be more innovative if they do that
[4:22:36] MrBubzTV: like, i'm happy that it was delayed because it wasn't ready - and I'd rather a finished product - but it still does worry me lol.
[4:22:41] sbrice87: the second half of prepatch maybe late Nov, making ahadowlands mid December. which means raiding January
[4:22:55] CaptainTVBot: towelliee just selected a battle and the action begins in 30 minutes! Head to https://www.streamraiders.com/t/towelliee now to place your units and help earn a victory!
[4:22:56] skullripper11: Pog, i killed a siege tower :P
[4:22:57] swordwindgaming: @Kisswani I think basically any music that is on an ost soundtrack you can buy is inviting copyright strikes. Thats what it sounds like from these posts.
[4:22:57] Dark_lite7: If they delay the raid, they'd have to cap renown, right?
[4:22:58] Aeylid: they should just like....not care about that at this point lol
[4:22:58] ShiftsEU: Last Tuesday of December is fine.. not smart to go to NYE parties now anyway, might as well level and gear up :D
[4:23:00] papaPathos: @sbrice87 sounds about right in my book.
[4:23:05] Tzarvahl: they'd just put a cap on it i think
[4:23:06] Lolwilltv: 5 weeks damn
[4:23:22] manmower: should focus on the classes and bugs
[4:23:27] sbrice87: @angiergaming right
[4:23:35] Mecabeast: I'm still guessing either a dec 8 or dec 15 with a raid release on jan 5
[4:23:35] NonGloriaFero: Is it completely improbable they don’t release until January?
[4:23:36] Aeylid: im think when we see the the first event of prepatch we are 4 weeks out
[4:23:36] Zevtherev: What ilvl is second half of prepatch drop from bosses?
[4:23:36] vintersorgSA: SL is so fucked lol
[4:23:36] Thunderbrew: Just put out a top product. Put it out in January. I'm good
[4:23:36] idenkaz_: no way
[4:23:37] MOLAR305: unless they rework soulbinds so nothing of value comes from renown to 0-10
[4:23:37] GrazzloTV: Im hoping for end of november
[4:23:39] xUrb4n: 3rd is election day
[4:23:50] 3rdbestboomy: the people saying relese assap andpush the raid are the same ones that will complain when the race is over in a week
[4:23:50] mr_valgar: 24/11 if they whant raid in 2020 or they will delay more -2021
[4:23:50] LoseAlotLuke: no way they do election day
[4:23:50] Khyber_GT: it's not going to release at thanksgiving
[4:23:51] Ziephier: I would think at least 4 weeks of invasion
[4:23:51] swordart_19: I think there is a lot of people subbed who do not care much and these who do so much are not playing
[4:23:57] Aeylid: Dec 1 - Dec 8
[4:24:00] GrazzloTV: Yeah it's hard with the holidays
[4:24:00] swordart_19: about release
[4:24:00] northsidegamer212: @Towelliee Election day too ha
[4:24:01] Aeylid: and delay raid release
[4:24:01] Dhomeli: Classic released around Thanksgiving, but yeah... seems too short of a notice
[4:24:02] Ululani: Just got here, so you think they will let us know 3 weeks out?
[4:24:03] MemeRobber: there no good way to release the xpac now in a reasonable time because blizzard is fucking stupid
[4:24:04] Aeylid: and god speed boys
[4:24:06] Corver: week after Thanksgiving or in January.
[4:24:09] KyruNL: Nothing in 2020 makes sense tbh
[4:24:09] robertjordan83: jan is making more and more sense
[4:24:09] Tzarvahl: i'd be hyped about dec 1st release date lol
[4:24:15] DragonofWolves: they won't do election day, they ain't that stupid
[4:24:16] Forezera: I believe raid will open only in january
[4:24:16] RealZedz: OMEGALUL us thanksgiving
[4:24:22] propoopimus: Dec 29th release
[4:24:22] rye_dale: barely any release dates make sense for the rest of the year, with thanksgiving, christmas and new years
[4:24:24] Thoreya: its gonna launch Nov 24. on my birthday obviously :)
[4:24:26] manmower: there is no way for them to release at the end of the year without impacting someone's Holiday plans, it doesn't matter much at this point
[4:24:26] Dhomeli: Mythic week of Christmas LUL
[4:24:38] LoseAlotLuke: they can take as long as they damn want, ive got cyberpunk and ps5 shit to contend with @Towelliee
[4:24:39] Vitalsigns64: I would prefer a January release date. I'd like to enjoy AC:Valhalla and Cyberpunk a little bit ;)
[4:24:42] CozzyFlannel: @Towelliee I got an ad yesterday for Shadowlands 2020
[4:24:45] s_t_o_r_m__: 29th sounds about right
[4:24:48] Ululani: 29th of Nov?
[4:24:53] Sincline387: your making a lot of assumptions
[4:24:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[4:24:56] rye_dale: Dec
[4:24:56] KyruNL: imagine SL release on ur bday towelliee :O

[4:25:00] Gizadragon: make new year at this point
[4:25:00] Alienfromger: 29th december then
[4:25:04] MemeRobber: 2 month delay for the same unfinished dogshit content LUL
[4:25:04] Madnezz123: so they say its 2020 LUL
[4:25:04] SirMaldo: they can release the pre-patch quest lines in a shorter time and have it only 1-2 weeks
[4:25:04] funKShun: 29 of Dec sounds dunb
[4:25:05] Reclaimer07: @Towelliee excuse my ignorance, havent checked anything about it lately, but, is there any clear or semi clear ideea when SL launches ? <3
[4:25:05] Thoreya: realistically dec 8 with raids pushed till january
[4:25:06] Lolwilltv: is gonna be around december watch
[4:25:06] amricatt: @Ululani December
[4:25:12] Theevun: All the wow nerds dissapearing from their new years plans lol
[4:25:12] PineappleBoB06: That would be perfect for me I already have time off that week
[4:25:12] Aeylid: My brain say the 8th, my heart says the 8th...but my right testicles is like "Dec 29"
[4:25:14] tulifau_: either that or blizz tells their employees no holidays for you peasants lol
[4:25:15] Sincline387: like "only 3 weeks of scourge invasion" they could stretch that out as long as they want
[4:25:17] CriticalPhil: i dont give a shit at this point lol
[4:25:20] Horuseternal69: 29th december is the best date worldwide skips all holidays/elections random shit going on in the world
[4:25:21] Aeylid: and sometimes that testicle KNOWS
[4:25:22] mizerylol: You're assuming Blizz / Activision cares about their employees though KEKW
[4:25:23] Queuestrong: No one will be allowed to visit friends & family on Thanksgiving in the US - plenty of time to play games.
[4:25:24] ceranac23: ready LUL
[4:25:25] vintersorgSA: @Reclaimer1989 how will he know??? lol and he's literally talking about it now haha
[4:25:26] Burntlettuce: Just do it January. you know how hard it will be to take time off at the end of December

[4:26:35] Zevtherev: @matrix_17 Kappa
[4:26:37] TheBilbojj: BC was also their first expasion so delays was kinda expected
[4:26:38] gammacyn: so blizz has a thing about not overlapping raid events for holidays, so its either the last week of november or the first week of january
[4:26:44] nocturnal_2195: @towelliee In your opinion do you think complexity limit will have any real compitition for world first for the first raid of shadowlands

[4:29:13] eyemyor: Cant completely rule them out post-first tier, though I wont say they have much of a chance even after that.
[4:29:13] Sincline387: GO COWBO.....ooops method
[4:29:13] Affiiance: I love how the Echo guys just jumped ship and are basically getting off free while Sco takes all the heat
[4:29:14] DerekChats: imagine being a method fanboi in 2020
[4:29:16] xTikos: method can probably be top 10 kill the first tier
[4:29:21] PhillyDilly18: who throws a shoe, honestly
[4:29:22] BJofBorg: Thanks for the KPOPfan @bmac6996
[4:29:22] bingo_banggo: You have to be neutral to the faction before starting the ring of blood questline. Try this one first -https://www.wowhead.com/quest=9917/do-my-eyes-deceive-me
[4:29:23] eyemyor: Echo will be up there in contention.
[4:29:23] Colly_UK: either way i think it will be interesting to see how or if they rebuild
[4:29:24] cruzeal: yeah who needs healers fuck em
[4:29:26] muertomans: i dont get how people are signing with method after everything that happened...
[4:29:27] cazzkyy: you dont have horsemen mount?
[4:29:32] MetallicusGaming: Jersmagi they alrdy have a full team arldy
[4:29:34] MemeRobber: method LOOOOOOOOOOL
[4:29:37] Bonedit: is Echo the new Method?
[4:29:39] UglyMoo4510: hello everyone
[4:29:42] manmower: it'll take years
[4:29:43] Zevtherev: Wait people actually heal that fight? KEKW
[4:29:48] Grunton: methods will just be a name nothing more
[4:29:49] Pacostrano: remove healing
[4:29:49] Horuseternal69: if method some how manage to find 25 people who are seriously on par with what they had before by the second tier i'll personally donate 50 subs to this chan. they had 700+ applicants and only 7 were actually considered bringing to the guild
[4:29:51] UglyMoo4510: how is eveyone doing today
[4:29:55] Thoreya: is sco can do it ill be heavily surprised
[4:29:58] Affiiance: Echo is just as bad as Method IMO, its the same people
[4:29:59] de_thrash: remove healer
[4:29:59] 107GOATY: is server not down in 7 mins?
[4:30:00] Ertra: lol you're still queueing as healer
[4:30:11] jers_gaming: @MetallicusGaming, really, i didnt know that i dont follow method that closely so i didnt know that
[4:30:13] funKShun: me :)
[4:30:15] nielefs: i dont think echo have a good chance tho
[4:30:18] ribose1982: everyone can play that well if given the chance
[4:30:19] Technogre: I'm right here Kappa
[4:30:22] TheRiwen: TheRiwen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[4:30:22] Moobot: @THERIWEN with the 28 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[4:30:23] s_t_o_r_m__: It's going take alot of time for sure
[4:30:31] Auru: i mean if anyone can do it its going to be the guy who did it once already
[4:30:36] Snabido: It will take 10.0 too
[4:30:41] MetallicusGaming: Jersmagi yh they releasing the roster with the new ppl in first week of November
[4:30:41] eyemyor: Echo is Method minus those that got caught up in the politics of the bullshit
[4:30:43] Horuseternal69: probably at least a year before they see a competitve team
[4:30:44] othraerir: kungen is back too, wants to get top 20
[4:30:44] xTikos: i kinda disagree.. theres plenty of people the same skill level, but the difference is most people have full time jobs currently and raid more casually
[4:30:48] Sincline387: maybe top 20 by end of expac
[4:30:56] WeE_wOo_WhEn: but red bull gives you wings...
[4:31:07] mmrghost7: TSM TSM TSM
[4:31:11] Affiiance: Echo is just the people on Method that didnt get completely roasted by the court of public opinion
[4:31:13] lel3owski: nah, most people are trash, lol
[4:31:17] sir_vanillin: prepare towHAMUP
[4:31:18] eyemyor: Should be really interesting to see how Nihilum does
[4:31:26] Horuseternal69: ^
[4:31:28] Sincline387: but where else will people get 20 minute breaks after every pull
[4:31:29] Tzarvahl: even if method were able to get same caliber of players, i doubt sponsors would touch em. too much outrage
[4:31:30] Colly_UK: over something like 10 years as well lol
[4:31:32] Zerafuse: Who are you rooting for world first?
[4:31:34] Kisswani: parses =\= execution
[4:31:36] Horuseternal69: im hoping nihilum does really well
[4:31:38] redtemplar88: oof we got some method fanbois here lol.
[4:31:39] Thoreya: sco said they have lke a full roster
[4:31:39] medanmarko: @Tikos_5 Raid Casually, Same skill level as Method. Pick one.
[4:31:50] xTikos: yeah yeah, very true. im thinking more top 10, not beating limit/echo
[4:31:54] xXSiebzehnXx: I'd leave my job if they could pay me the same ;)
[4:31:55] jers_gaming: @MetallicusGaming Alright i will have to check it it, even though i dont see them being worlds first for this upcoming xpac, but if they are i wish them the best of luck
[4:32:02] Crowzcut: you never they may got 16 players ready
[4:32:02] pjahj: Is nothing going to happen to scripe for admitting to buying gold?
[4:32:03] nielefs: Method and echo have no chance to win this raid
[4:32:05] eyemyor: I would love to see Nihilum do very well, just to see the smile on Kungen's face. He's a good guy.
[4:32:09] eyemyor: He deserves it
[4:32:15] Horuseternal69: indeed
[4:32:18] Antdavs24: prettu sure their recruitment page says WF competitive by end of the expac LUL
[4:32:26] kaya4tw: is there any updates or expected announcements on SL release?
[4:32:29] Bonedit: Its because they have real jobs that they cant match parses
[4:32:30] xTikos: maybe OTK will get world first one day
[4:32:33] SubQ: especially under the same name
[4:32:34] MetallicusGaming: kayatheDH nope
[4:32:34] PorAmor: Damn you mean they dont pay their raiders?
[4:32:35] Horuseternal69: @pjahj i was hoping for a perma ban, anyone else caught doing that shit would get one so why not him!
[4:32:40] jers_gaming: Echo has a very very good chance especially when 90 percent is previous worlds first raiders
[4:32:41] Grunton: world first is cool but you dont get anything from it unless your a streamer
[4:32:41] Thoreya: yeah sco wants to compete for world first in shadowlands
[4:32:44] dforward: Are you using the tmog wings to trigger people?
[4:32:49] Mecabeast: id quit my job to be paid to world first raid XD
[4:32:52] Colly_UK: yeah i think OTK will come out of left field for W1 KEKW
[4:33:05] RealZedz: Is echo just the players that left and made their own guild or is that the rebranded method

[5:59:25] Papacalypto: Yea, the 3090 is expensive when it's not that even that much more powerful than a 3080. They only think it has is a bunch of extra vid mem that you won't even use most of the time.

[6:00:07] Mecabeast: @wallermd I'm pretty similar but im still waiting for things to drop price because my motherboard is lacking room

[6:17:37] rslamer: i would drop the ball imediatly if he was chassing me
[6:17:43] watpuppy: DB's are usually the fastest players on the field, too, so they can keep up with receivers. Very impressive a WR was able to catch him

[6:18:31] DecayedmiNt: It's like Rudolph Ingram, He's 7 years old and ran the 100m in 13 seconds. just 4 seconds slower than Usain Bolt.
[6:18:34] foxies_havocing: yo, he shouldn't be runnin in school zone :D
[6:18:39] saimonest: im glad that i dont have mcdonalds near me i would be out of money
