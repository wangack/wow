[1:36:55] Genghjs: Enhancement goes strong still
[1:36:55] tacodoc: Shaman was probably at maximum fun back when stormstrike stacked and you could get a pi and chain lightning for 25k
[1:36:58] grylz89: Overload chain lightning with fire nova....they will be legit AF on trash
[1:36:58] ritter184: Did your searing totem lightning totem itself to death?
[1:36:59] typer___iban: idk sham tank still seems cracked

[1:39:14] menexus20: Do you think overload could interact with chain heals as well? Could be OP
[1:39:15] hutchie24: i raid on 4 cahrs a reset and not seen the staff drop once.,..
[1:39:21] nikoftz2227: omE
[1:39:26] saund: staff is so overrated, when you can have a -5 spellpower option but gain 7 stamina amd 100 armour, so much more beneficial imo
[1:39:30] typer___iban: @RageTry same, warrior alt i don't play got sword in first 2 runs tho lol
[1:39:30] throssome: mmm lemon danish
[1:39:34] Kopawow: guzu u could buy cloth belt from ah

[1:40:09] menexus20: Super high hopes for shaman healer as well. - Do you think overload could interact with chain heals as well? Could be OP
[1:40:15] m1cke90: Remember the battle of Lund in 1676? Thats right you guys didn't blast then
[1:40:27] nikoftz2227: uuh

[1:40:47] duke_duck: Had my first staff drop after 32 Kelris kills across two chars drop yesterday, unfortunately lost it
[1:40:56] Ragi_Fz: @saldemius -7 spell power, less int, less spirit
[1:40:59] ritter184: Idk if they stack
[1:41:05] menexus20: @Guzu also shaman tank given they will wear mail? Could overtake other classes (Warlock etc..)
[1:41:10] EnyoHC: oiling ur weapon helps guzuSmug SALAMIhand
[1:41:13] JoYneX: Remember 1088, when contemporary England was conquered by a Danish king?
[1:41:15] Galfond9: @duke_duck Feels like they increased the drop rate, we had like 8 drops in the last 3 days
[1:41:20] denforslund: dw rockbier is more mana, cuz it scales so big with shamanistic rage
[1:41:22] Ragi_Fz: Dagger of the willing sacrifice is unique, so you can't stack them
[1:41:23] Moo360: ive never seen the staff or the kitty mace - done every single reset including that first one
[1:41:25] etou1: Does weapon oil stack?
[1:41:27] b1azzuris: i got the staff first time i saw it on my rdruid

[1:42:33] nikoftz2227: but Guzu did you know there is no uber in kansas omE
[1:42:38] Tropicocity: every caster should want the staff regardless of spec, even if its not bis for your spec in the raid, the moment phase 2 comes out you'll want that 26 sp
[1:42:43] nikoftz2227: AINTNOWAY
[1:42:54] EnyoHC: Austria too i think

[1:42:56] Kleipd: i understood somehting other than artistic and thought i could relate
[1:42:57] LabyrinthMW: Banmark?
[1:42:57] JoYneX: as far as I know, there is still a Danish law, valid till this day, that states if a Swede is to cross over  walking on ice, you can defend yourself with a stick.
[1:42:57] big_bang_impact: @Tropicocity nope lol
[1:43:01] azshare_: ... how did it get banned lol

[1:43:35] zdh7: should help with kicking since your not helping with dps
[1:43:43] GrovesyM: They should ban Deliveroo too, pretty sure 80% of those people aren't in the country legally.
[1:43:44] EnyoHC: @GrimWizard They had issues here in Austria cuz of their taxing so it was banned a while back

The one advantage that a Silverback might have is the enormous strength of its muscles. While grizzlies are immensely strong, gorillas, chimps, and monkeys have much greater muscle strength than other animals of a similar size. Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
