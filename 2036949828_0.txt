[6:09:53] ashuraasura: you can use frostbolt to pull extra mobs from the side
[6:10:05] Pandalawlz: I'm here for the full send on living bomb ae
[6:10:07] Pandalawlz: but they fuck
[6:10:09] Pandalawlz: lol
[6:10:15] ashuraasura: heal buff first

[6:10:48] twix_h: living flames on caster , pack on him , packpedal
[6:10:50] SubaruWRXSTI87: pop regen, living bomb 2 mobs, then living flame, nova than arcane
[6:10:51] ashuraasura: nova freezes them

[6:11:22] twix_h: living flame maybe ? :D
[6:11:31] JohnnyJargon: one living flame with regen you woulda lived
[6:11:32] Pandalawlz: In SOD they hit soooo much harder it makes it rough. You almost haaaaave to living flame for the heal
[6:11:45] ashuraasura: then get a different rune on it
[6:11:47] wyldhayden: pin it to win it, give them the hammer all ball no peen
[6:12:01] Pandalawlz: I did it on era but in SOD they hit harder
[6:12:19] tsukasavivi: You need blink and blizzard
[6:12:24] twix_h: you need wait 20+ for blizzard without Sod spells .
[6:12:33] Pandalawlz: Regen>Living flame a further mob> run around and AE
[6:12:42] xyth_alispera: Regen living flame on the caster gnoll then arcane explosion to keep your health topped off
[6:12:48] Pandalawlz: You can cast some living bombs if you want but 12 sec is so long for these non-elite mobs
[6:13:00] dardysing: Living bomb to pull mobs > regen > Living flame
[6:13:00] Pandalawlz: There arent casters in these groups
[6:13:00] xyth_alispera: Living bomb to pull mobs not frost bolt lol
[6:13:05] Pandalawlz: but I would avoid flaming casters
[6:13:25] Pandalawlz: You basically want the melee to run through the living flame as much as possible. The mobs take extra dmg if they run back trhough the fire.

[6:14:04] dardysing: or only do 2 first
[6:14:06] Pandalawlz: Regen before pull
[6:14:10] Pandalawlz: so you get beacon
[6:14:27] JohnnyJargon: the hyper spawn crabs are perfect for learning
[6:14:39] Pandalawlz: and then just cast ilke 2 living bombs to pull and then living flam eand run around and you'll just live forever
[6:14:43] Pandalawlz: The herbalist isnt ranged
[6:14:47] Pandalawlz: they dont cast and they all melee
[6:14:55] dardysing: Or even try the rotation on 1
[6:15:02] Pandalawlz: All ove the gnolls from these camps south are all melee
[6:15:04] dardysing: regen!!!!
[6:15:05] JohnnyJargon: quick regen
[6:15:06] Pandalawlz: you can quick regen yourself
[6:15:11] Pandalawlz: You had it
[6:15:16] Pandalawlz: but you just have to stop moving rq to get regen
[6:15:43] ashuraasura: regen can proc buff while moving tho
[6:16:02] Pandalawlz: Regen before combat > Living bomb 1 and 2 > Flame whichever is slightly further from you and run through the mobs

[6:28:19] Pandalawlz: So one thing to keep in mind about living flame is that it doesnt pull when you cast it
[6:28:30] Pandalawlz: Meaning. Living flame will not aggro a mob until it does dmg to it
[6:28:38] Pandalawlz: so the trail leading up to the mob doesnt pull it immediately
[6:28:40] Pandalawlz: Correct
[6:28:53] Pandalawlz: so you can precast it but you lose a small amount of dmg and heals beacuse of it
[6:28:58] JohnnyJargon: unless it resists, then it insta pulls lol
[6:29:18] Pandalawlz: There are 2 pats in that camp
[6:29:24] Pandalawlz: and then theres 2 more sets of full gnoll camps

[6:53:02] Pandalawlz: I feel like it aint even worth the exp at that point lol
[6:53:24] Pandalawlz: I dont remember exactly where they are at but there are a few sets of hypersawn crabs along the westfall murloc coast
[6:53:45] Pandalawlz: When your living flame target dies, so does your living flame dmg and healing. So thats probably the biggest thing from this point forward
[6:53:55] Pandalawlz: I am one of them yes
[6:54:07] Pandalawlz: Did a 6minute long pull to get to 60 in HC :D
[6:54:32] Pandalawlz: Think of it like penanace
[6:54:40] Pandalawlz: but you get a buff that also lets you heal after that with your dmg spells
[6:54:47] gonepdx: u just hit it once then you get 30 secs of healing
[6:54:49] Pandalawlz: There is a 3 tick heal
[6:55:01] Pandalawlz: but you mainly want it for beacon because your "arcane" spells heal you
[6:55:18] Pandalawlz: and living flame is "spellfire" dmg or whatever so its considered fire and arcance
