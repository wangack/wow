[0:24:36] Buckwink: only dungeon trinkets?
[0:24:37] theoriginalzinng: do we know how much valor we are getting per m+?
[0:24:38] Alaquane: -1 leech from one of the healer trinkets
[0:24:55] Buckwink: thank fucking god
[0:25:05] MrGattz: slowly but surely we are getting there lol
[0:25:10] hectabit: yeah that 1500 max valor at a time was stupid
[0:25:25] hoyhoy007: FML
[0:25:35] theoriginalzinng: yeah i could have seen hitting cap you can hold and still trying to get a piece you need to drop so you can start upgrading it
[0:25:40] DehCantao: it makes even more sense with valor, because you want to keep it until you get a good item
[0:25:44] SilkeySmooth: you can use valor to upgrade pvp gear?
[0:25:50] RunningOutOfRAM: @Towelliee In Patch 9.0.5, Covenant Callings will reward players with Valor Points when you turn in the quest! If you want to get a head start for your Valor Point acquisition, make sure to save your Covenant Callings starting today!
[0:25:54] MrGattz: @SilkeySmooth no ofc not lol
[0:26:05] MrGattz: you have a pvp vender and upgrade system for pvp stuff
[0:26:11] theoriginalzinng: @SilkeySmooth no, gop do pvp things to upgrade pvp gears
[0:26:21] SilkeySmooth: so m) and above?
[0:26:22] CritcobainTV: towPog
[0:26:26] SilkeySmooth: m)
[0:26:48] theoriginalzinng: i get a feeling that the reward from these quests probably wont change
[0:26:50] PadidinJones: Hey @Towelliee !!
[0:27:03] othraerir: it's only 35 valor anyway, or 50 if it's the epic calling

[0:27:37] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee the DoS strength trinket got nerfed
[0:27:38] Broomba: The gear for valor is from normal, heroic or mythic instance runs?
[0:27:43] theoriginalzinng: if its like 35 or some shit i might still rage out
[0:27:46] SageRuskiy: Good Morning Friends
[0:27:47] Armdel: looked like basically every dungeon trinket and raid trinket got buffed
[0:27:49] SageRuskiy: slootHi
[0:28:04] SilkeySmooth: so now the casual m+ players that were doing m+4's can upgrade to 226 with ease no need for high keys?
[0:28:06] theoriginalzinng: lemme go do 800 +m to upgrade one 2h weapon lol
[0:28:16] Kaykerrs: Good morning everyone
[0:28:17] theoriginalzinng: no they cant silkey
[0:28:18] MrGattz: so whats the reason for buffing all the trinkets?
[0:28:26] Average_Stali: we only use the barghast leash to try and kill dps for fun in raids
[0:28:31] LoremasterMarthan: They probably hate that pvp trinket is BiS for most dps lol
[0:28:32] theoriginalzinng: read the stuff man, its a lot more than that for requirements
[0:28:40] FoulBundy: o great lol
[0:28:46] DrakeDuude: mages got stronger
[0:28:55] theoriginalzinng: its like saying some noob who only does epic bgs can upgrade their weapons to 233
[0:29:10] othraerir: they seem around 10%
[0:29:19] SageRuskiy: So what your saying is theres no font of power situation, blizzard will be sure to listen for 9.1 slootKEK

[0:37:12] mazzu7000: 1% of china speak english
[0:37:20] SageRuskiy: @Towelliee Did you see they removed the 5000 cap on valor?
[0:37:21] Recording_on_the_grass: thats nothing
[0:37:22] Zansteh: slootFat
[0:37:29] Broomba: China firewall for internet is strict on what Chinese people sees and access
[0:37:33] Valient491: wait there's no cap on valor?
[0:37:33] magemaster225: I only could find an icy veins post that says 15
[0:37:37] Average_Stali: it will take like a month to upgrade a piece from what my GM was saying
[0:37:38] magemaster225: 135*
[0:37:45] othraerir: do you think 10 valor per key level is fair?
[0:38:01] SageRuskiy: There was a wowhead article that stated they removed the 5000 valor cap
[0:38:01] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[0:38:07] SageRuskiy: so you are limited per week, but not total
[0:38:10] ReGdYN: I think China was blocking Twitch, so you couldn't use that addon manager. But nwo that's under Overwolf it should be better. But they still don't support chinese language so it's difficult for the chinese people...
[0:38:10] CardinalTX: Give me valor in heroic dungeons because fuck mythics
[0:38:19] SageRuskiy: Heroic dungeons KEKW

[0:38:46] theoriginalzinng: @Tacoma64 you cant even get gear that you can start upgrading in heroic, be less casual
[0:38:50] SilkeySmooth: ksm boost craze inc
[0:38:50] CritcobainTV: KEKW heroic dungeons
[0:38:55] Wildside1177: Very few casual players will see any benefit. Very few of us have KSM.
[0:38:55] Recording_on_the_grass: haha
[0:38:56] Sandisy: boosting services are going to be busy busy KEKW
[0:39:01] tungexd: @Towelliee is necrolord go to for prot instead of kyrian>?
[0:39:15] akia03: is m0 gear upgradeable?
[0:39:20] jerexify: @Towelliee Wait, you still have the "Support the Court" quest. So you DON'T have to finish all those before setting up your covenant sanctum and all that?
[0:39:20] theoriginalzinng: @Wildside1177 casuals can upgrade their m0 gear to 200 for no achievement
[0:39:26] bertooso: Is it to soon to ask for account-wide Valor? LUL
[0:39:31] leexs2: KSM?
[0:39:37] Valient491: keystone mastery

[0:40:02] Average_Stali: yes it will, but its really easy
[0:40:04] theoriginalzinng: you all really need to read the notes on valor, there is 3 levels of unlocking further upgrades
[0:40:05] Recording_on_the_grass: boosters having partys rn
[0:40:07] Balzofsteels: will you be able to upgrade your alt if you have ksm on main ? or you need it on every char
[0:40:18] SageRuskiy: I believe the KSM is account wide
[0:40:20] CritcobainTV: Warrior OP POGGERS
[0:40:21] Valient491: one per account
[0:40:22] Wildside1177: @Wildside1177 200 gear is useless.
[0:40:24] Broomba: Valor gear for upgrades normal heroic or mythic instances?
[0:40:25] CanadianHellMoose: KSM is account wide
[0:40:26] SilkeySmooth: lfg will be 90% boosters now..lol
[0:40:28] ohnot___her: @Balzofsteels its account wide
[0:40:34] SageRuskiy: Imagine having to do all 15s on your Venthyr priest pvp alt KEKW
[0:40:37] Balzofsteels: kk ty
[0:40:53] Balzofsteels: main is 225 since 2month i hope i dont have to farm it again on alt XD
[0:41:03] Alaquane: 20% shield wall for every class, seems nice
[0:41:16] SageRuskiy: If you have gear from vault over 220 ilevel valor does nothing for your main
[0:41:24] SageRuskiy: if you are kitted out
[0:41:28] BeezyLo: @Towelliee have you heard that you have to redo 15's to get the unlock for ksm upgrades
[0:41:34] theoriginalzinng: @Wildside1177 not for casuals lol, some of them dont even have their covenant gear upgraded lol
[0:41:39] Balzofsteels: yeah i know its bad for main but my alts are all around 200 ilvl
[0:41:48] Average_Stali: warrior powers are kinda like that in torghast...theres a lot of dud powers
[0:42:03] Buckwink: Man I wish Hunters would start going necro, its my fave cov
[0:42:15] SageRuskiy: @Average_Stali and thens theres VDH powers, i did my layer 8 runs in 150 ilevel KEKW
[0:42:18] DallTV_: haii
[0:42:20] banagth: do you play clasic
[0:42:23] mmrghost7: BOOOOOM WUDUP
[0:42:37] CardinalTX: @Tacoma64 You are correct. I am apparently to casual for the current design of the game ive been playing for 15 years. 100% understand that
[0:42:40] honeychonker: good for soaking on SLG
[0:42:42] Wildside1177: @theoriginalzinng I am referring to the opeople stuck in the 205 hole. They have no way to upgrade gear without doing M+ griond and they are not interested.
[0:42:43] SilkeySmooth: can you buy valor gear with the valor points froma vendor like they did in bfa?
[0:42:55] SageRuskiy: No @SilkeySmooth
[0:43:03] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee maybe they should rethink the penalty for switching covenants too
[0:43:04] SageRuskiy: Its purely to upgrade dungeon drops
[0:43:11] Average_Stali: @sage_ruskiy im tempted to do my layer 8 on my DH...hes like ilvl 210 anyways...warrior struggles in twisted corridors
[0:43:36] lieutenantdan416: do you enjoy to dance
[0:43:36] SageRuskiy: @Average_Stali If you get immo aura extended on damage early on, its over. Just pop in the conduit that makes each tick tick harder
[0:43:43] SilkeySmooth: @sage_ruskiy so then whats the point of putting valor in callings if some one doesnt run m+?
[0:43:53] Alaquane: I do soaks with that Plague Deviser Marileth's Ultimate Form, immune to CC and gain 2% hp per second.  I'm just a derp survival hunter though :)
[0:43:58] theoriginalzinng: try being stuck in the 215 hole, its even worse lol
[0:43:58] Average_Stali: @sage_ruskiy ill keep that in mind, might try tomorrow
[0:44:13] SageRuskiy: I mean you could run a 2, loot your shit item and slowly upgrade to 220 @SilkeySmooth Unless you mean you NEVER do m+
[0:44:15] Orcmondo: my man!
[0:44:22] SageRuskiy: In which case no reason @SilkeySmooth
[0:44:29] Mallaes: As long it's not the week of June 8th that when 9.1 is getting released, cause I want to play the new R&C game :^)
[0:44:33] SilkeySmooth: @sage_ruskiy i never do m+
[0:44:42] SageRuskiy: Then its a dud currency

[0:45:15] SageRuskiy: @SilkeySmooth Its added for people who do a little bit of M+, to supplement where the valor comes from
[0:45:49] MuttonChopins: public alpha for what?
[0:45:53] Wcvechten: Why not in the week of June 8th?
[0:45:56] theoriginalzinng: if you dont do any m+ then you dont really need gear anyhow

[1:40:29] xrandomdoodx: The devs tried to make the game too much like classic wow, and learned the wrong lessons from classic's success.
[1:40:30] rhkka: wow lore is really good

[1:40:35] Dirtroit: Aren’t WoW expansions kinda like Poe updates? Really heavy for the main pages for a month or so and then drops off
[1:40:38] Demanisraar: I have noticed I play waaaaaay less then before.. I see no need to grind out anima and shit.. I just do m+ and farm rares
[1:40:39] xrandomdoodx: The extreme lack of loot turned a lot of casuals off of shadowlands
[1:40:40] zmr44: is it tho ?
[1:40:42] Sollice: I didnt think it before, but I think being locked in to one covenent is really not great. Swear allegience to one to get the spells, but let me do all of the callings and quests in the others. That would be tons of content

[1:42:07] Demanisraar: Hope they keep it

[1:44:11] Lincoln_WoW: yes
[1:44:15] belaham: anima grind sucks cause it doesn't help player power. AP was much better

[1:44:23] ohnot___her: Lol the same people saying they wanted it gone are the same people saying they miss it now. See this is why Blizz cant win with WoW players
[1:44:24] Lincoln_WoW: in hindsight legion was such a good expansion
[1:44:28] Mathhbm: anima sucks
[1:44:28] bertooso: Sad
[1:44:30] Sollice: AP for Neck gave you a goal to continue to work towards. AP in Legion helped you progress your weapon. Neither were bad
[1:44:43] raldrik: I think the random stuff like titan and war forging were fun. It was exciting to get that awesome piece of loot.
[1:44:46] Demanisraar: Start of Legion was ass though
[1:44:49] Wcvechten: legion's start was a bit eh, but they fixed it real gud
[1:44:49] Lincoln_WoW: classic legion when
[1:44:51] pilhass10: legion was pretty nice the start of it tho..
[1:44:54] Kelluthus: I miss titan forging, gave me a reason to keep repeating raid over and over in hopes of that upgrade.

[1:45:08] Putcride: legion style ap I loved but bfa style was meh only corruption was more fun
[1:45:26] akia03: increase the power of your cov ability
[1:45:29] Sollice: Anima is frankly useless. Aside from upgrading your covenent armor which only goes to 197. Is there anything that anima is useful for? All of your sanctum upgrades, do you actually NEED any of them?

[1:51:42] Mathhbm: true
[1:51:43] Sollice: I love it lol @Towelliee I got 4 legos on that normal raid yesterday
[1:51:47] Xithamas: glyphs KEKW
[1:51:57] NILLme: epics with unique bonuses
[1:51:59] Kelluthus: 100% disagree, would be a pain running raid with only one chance of getting your legendary weekly.
[1:52:05] honeychonker: they should have been called something else, like runecarved, and a different colour
[1:52:06] reyvin40: plus you can buy random ones from your covenant
[1:52:06] bertooso: Imagine it with the drop rates
[1:52:11] SlackerSlack017: mop leggo best so far?
[1:52:17] chrispape: pfft.. soooo much work went into getting a Thunderfury back in Vanilla.. I dont think it should be THAT hard though
[1:52:21] bertooso: People would have long been gone probably
[1:52:27] Kinghorn: if it isnt 100% then you have the poor bastard who goes 2 months without their BiS dropping
[1:52:29] RodneyIsPro: i think its funny tere are like 20 powers for each class and only 1 is used
[1:52:31] 3663Sharad: Its becaue you can  raid with your group. Peebs that complain are LFR / PUG guys
[1:52:45] smashwow: not having certain leggos would have made classes/spec unplayable.
[1:52:47] kodtheog: its to help the casuals keep playing
[1:52:47] Kelluthus: At least with dungeons you could run them over and over. So it was good getting 100% on raid.
[1:52:51] RodneyIsPro: maybe 2
[1:52:52] Demanisraar: Better to have them all drop then to grind for months like I di in LEgion
[1:53:03] Lincoln_WoW: my biggest issue with legendary item is that torghast is boring

[1:53:13] bertooso: No people like alts
[1:53:16] Demanisraar: I quit legion because people where not letting me in M+ groups because I had no lego LUL
[1:53:22] Layercake: Dam...legos upgrades are bad...thorgast boring...the maw is bad, CN is meh, the progression systems sucks, m+ gear sucks. Wait wasn't Shadowlands were supposed to be a improvement  LUL
[1:53:30] Wcvechten: 24 hour island stream again pog

[1:54:10] Wulfgrym: @critcobain shinne has one spot left
[1:54:12] Aidler: from islands we get at least some mounts
[1:54:15] Allvarez: wait did the valor cap get removed?
[1:54:23] NILLme: torghast atm is a wasted content

[1:56:00] williamthewedeish: that nose reminds me of james from cowchop
[1:56:01] Xirmak: Going to be funny when people cap valor and then realize they dont have KSM to upgrade their gear anyways
[1:56:06] Demanisraar: This guy Jebaited
[1:56:15] williamthewedeish: and why did i only get 5 min ban
[1:56:41] Aidler: omg I just got this ugly mission table mount...
[1:56:46] williamthewedeish: but u kinda look like a pedo tho jk
[1:56:46] AustinRysk: Is there a list anywhere that’s every m+ skill that can be soothed or tranq shotted? Uhhh
[1:57:00] elchaposkjelbo: its about 100 they said in patch notes earlier
[1:57:04] Demanisraar: Someone asking for a permaban KEKW
[1:57:15] williamthewedeish: its a joke bro
[1:57:32] Demanisraar: try harder, they are not funny
[1:57:36] PrxSick: theres like 25 carries in there
[1:57:37] bertooso: Hope servers survive reset Kappa
[1:57:39] Xirmak: @NiLLx_ no M+ is a weak terribly designed addition to dungeons that end up diluting and making every dungeon the same dungeon
[1:57:45] williamthewedeish: k
[1:57:47] williamthewedeish: monke

[1:58:52] NILLme: wish i had upgrades from valor upgrades... all i need is the IQD trinket
[1:58:53] FatChase: Does Valor drop from raids or is it callings and dungeons?
[1:59:00] a_scoootz: what covenant did you go on War? @Towelliee
[1:59:20] Broomba: devoOOPS devoWELP
[1:59:31] Aedarax: i'll give it a week KEKW
[1:59:32] JerBoody: It will create the same situation as we have in pvp where people by the achievement but then just grind easy dungeons to upgrade to full ,not fun
[1:59:33] 無職提督: wow, thats kinda greedy
[1:59:33] KnsWoW: should be like that.. we're too far into xpac
[1:59:33] Konnartist: nah

[1:59:53] Polvs: at what point u can stop doing torghast and the maw?
[1:59:53] Kromede: i can counter that Broomba slootK slootB
[1:59:53] zmr44: i think the second part is valid
[1:59:53] OceanManCarter: That would be amazing if they did that
[1:59:55] NILLme: previous gear upgrade is 100% happening after the masses notice it LUL
[2:00:00] Rictamar: already unsubbed, I aint coming back until 9.1
[2:00:02] bertooso: True
[2:00:04] Zettabyte: @Towelliee you called?
[2:00:15] Kromede: pepeMeltdown
[2:00:20] TheRiwen: I maybe come back to 9.3
[2:00:25] NILLme: and i wouldnt be surprised if 15s will let us upgrade up to 226
[2:00:27] Demanisraar: true
[2:00:41] Demanisraar: up till 216 would be good
[2:00:45] cruzeal: that would be more casual friendly for sure
[2:01:07] raptorstrick: Totally agree
[2:01:24] ForTheSchmitt: Thank you
[2:01:26] akia03: even just 213 without ach would be nice

[2:04:06] AstridLory: Omg why they do that in lfr
[2:04:10] TheRiwen: so 218 is bad then
[2:04:18] SSD511_: We need a 233 wep
[2:04:21] kappaday23: Keepo
[2:04:37] SSD511_: Not paying 20m in rbg
[2:04:42] wetttnine: =(
[2:04:43] Kael88: I bet boosting communities are having a blast rn
[2:04:44] Demanisraar: Casuals should be able to get like 213/216 items at the highest
[2:04:45] deadawake_: I'm as casual as they come... sad days out here
[2:04:48] NILLme: good luck timing all 15s with 210-213 gear
[2:04:49] smashwow: the 220 cap is silly on ksm especially if there's not a 226 option for M+ but pvp has 226 and 233 weapon...
[2:04:59] byrdeen45: im 213 its not bad
[2:05:07] Wildside1177: The way it is right now I am not doing any of that shit.  Rather prepare for TBC.

[2:05:38] williamthewedeish: Prepare for tbc LUL
[2:05:49] Zaharial: i should get a 233 for pushing into the 18-20 range though, it should scale past 15, everything else has rewards for those who want to push
[2:05:51] Synk_live: I'm torn on whether to resub for 9.0.5 or wait until 9.1... or level in classic for TBC prep
[2:06:08] kappaday23: Kappa
[2:06:20] devildriver1919: cause nobody does m+ really, wanna get the gear, actually try to push
[2:06:22] smashwow: the fact the M+ community doesn't have the same system pvpers have is very frustrating.
[2:06:28] xrandomdoodx: if it gave 233 weps you'd see a lot more people doing it though lol
[2:06:47] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: D:

[2:55:19] ScriptzSB: you can play casually and get 60 quicker than 1 month
[2:55:34] SpencerHD: Thought they said you couldn't boost a bloodelf pally?
[2:55:44] itsthefuzzz: Tbc was defiantly the best expansion of all time in any mmo. However I think in today’s world, wrath will do better. The quality of life changes and ease of things drastically reduces the “farming” aspect of the game, and let’s players play more of the content!
[2:55:55] SilkeySmooth: nppst to 58 level to 60 then collect marks of honor for lvl 70 pvp gear

[2:58:35] DecayedmiNt: That's why Paragon started the first iteration of alt splits, they used it for Heroic Lich King attempts
[2:58:35] BRUTALIT0PS: I am fine with LFG as a system of looking for groups as long as it is not like an instant join and tp to the dungeon

[3:16:11] Chiphazzord: im doing 14 and 15's but i need ksm to make it worth having valor
[3:16:16] dimofodi: You leveled your Command Table higher
[3:16:21] BIueDream: they lvl so slow its sad
[3:16:25] dimofodi: You see the crown up top, says 25
[3:16:27] williamthewedeish: no feels like that for me too
[3:16:27] ZeethianDragon: that 48 mission is fkn OP
[3:16:31] nihilistic_bat: kyrian is so slow

[3:16:41] Justarandomman: venthyr is same

[3:17:36] Kratosirving1987: I kind of lost interest in the mission table super fast this time. I mean when it was braindead the past few times it was fine, but now I have to use more brain power than I wish
[3:17:38] Aidler: oh only gear from m+ can be upgraded. hmm so the system is not for me and I will stay at my 200 ilvl
[3:17:43] reborune22: ya i just log on to raid now
[3:17:48] Justarandomman: my campaign one right now is level 48 elite, and my highest follower is 35 lmao
[3:17:56] dimofodi: You just did one now! You're at 25 of 30 I think it is haha
[3:18:12] strike879: just send me on doomed runs the purple exp is guaranteed

[3:20:06] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[3:20:21] toxicedge: what mission table addon do you use?
[3:20:39] TheCliffyShow: Remember to not turn in your callings until tomorrow since they give Valor.
[3:20:59] Vadagar1: Venture plan makes the mission table 5x better
[3:21:15] PacioliNB: anyone got any idea on predicted down time for Tuesday?
[3:21:41] TheCliffyShow: Well, that's what Wowhead said.
[3:21:43] BlueBlurPrime: wowhead did post
[3:21:44] stuffe92: what can u buy from valor?
[3:21:51] Redreka: wowhead did tho lol
[3:21:55] Spaede: yea they did, 50 per in the pic they did
[3:21:59] reborune22: wowhead said callings give valor lol
[3:22:02] E5Mz: yep, it is on wowhead
[3:22:20] E5Mz: yes, but you can save them to get the valor tomorrow
[3:22:21] dimofodi: They posted an article but I'm willing to bet they don't know for certainty they will give valor early.
[3:22:22] reborune22: no they dont give them at all today
[3:22:29] reborune22: the question is do the ones today give valor tomorrow
[3:22:30] dimofodi: Or give ones from before patch give valor rather.
[3:22:44] GiraffeHydra_: wowhead did say that
[3:22:49] Redreka: what hurts by saving them tho?
[3:22:57] chrslp: Hit 40 on Azuresong last night FeelsBadMan
[3:23:00] foxies_havocing: tomo-row!
[3:23:01] nospmiSca: no hurting in saving then?
[3:23:01] tronbadgames: @Towelliee callings will be like the vault, everything until tomorrow - will not give valor.
[3:23:03] chrslp: FeelsGoodMan LUL **
[3:23:07] tebbix: the amount of valor points on callings will be worth it?
[3:23:11] PokerFaceMoose: i love snarky Towelliee
[3:23:15] Xerevil: just holding on to them MEANING NOT TURNING IT IN FOR THE BOXES
[3:23:31] reborune22: tomorROW lol
[3:23:34] BlueBlurPrime: boxes wont, the calling might
[3:23:35] Xerevil: turn in after reset
[3:24:05] EarlofCockwood: @Towelliee what do you think about the valorpoints comeback?
[3:24:06] Xerevil: nah,you should be able to get 2 yeah
[3:24:20] dimofodi: If you have 3, the oldest one will expire at reset before you can turn it in.
[3:24:21] TheCliffyShow: Towelliee's in fuck it mode.
[3:25:29] BlueBlurPrime: no, they just suggest to turn in souls and 1k anima at end of week

[3:25:47] reborune22: well if your chances depreciate the closer you get to max renown, then yes in theory it would hurt , but it would be minimal
[3:25:54] stuffe92: Will Rio score reset tomorrow??
[3:26:17] InFall: How mych valor does M+ give?
[3:26:36] TheCliffyShow: They don't reset for .5 patches.
[3:26:38] miktzo: June WutFace
[3:26:38] sdpercussion: your time would be better spent doing more dungeons than callings. because remember, you have to actually get all new gear to actually upgrade it with valor
[3:27:19] HaloS23: @Towelliee can valor be used for anything other than gear upgrades?
[3:27:47] TheCliffyShow: Which means you still got plenty of time for that KSM and AotC.
[3:27:59] TheCliffyShow: And Cutting Edge for you leet folk.
[3:28:20] meikev3: is Towellie some kind of pro player or how comes that he has so many viewers? (im new to wow)

[3:28:56] sdpercussion: @meikev3 he's popular because of his onlyfans leaked pics
[3:29:06] PacioliNB: as in if you got keystone master already your alts going to be ballin
[3:29:47] JPS15: if you have KSM on one character will it apply to all characters or just the 1
[3:29:53] BRUTALIT0PS: I know I am not going to be bothered doing it
[3:30:10] sdpercussion: KSM is not a character achievment
[3:30:11] miktzo: bizz after that token $$
[3:30:12] sdpercussion: its account
[3:30:16] BlueBlurPrime: I am a casual and I want to do atleast 10s in time on my on skill, got 5s done just need to work on 10s
[3:30:17] Zawyer: as an average player who loves the mount for keystone master, its cerstainly an incentive to complete it :P
[3:30:21] Wildside1177: If I could do 15s I wouldn't need this upgrade system.
[3:30:21] Aidler: I‘m certainly not. I hate M+
[3:30:23] reborune22: for a game that wants to be casual so bad, its wierd to put a cieling that high on a catchup mechanic
[3:30:27] SymphonyOnIce: whats ksm?
[3:30:29] Spaede: they probably read the chat during MDI and assumed everyone were experts LUL LUL LUL
[3:30:43] sdpercussion: you can get 15's done a few toons and KSM. you don't need them all done on the same toon
[3:31:01] MicNoobs: KSM = Keystone Master @trianglebananas
[3:31:08] Hwilly2o: sorry im horde
[3:31:11] Chiphazzord: i can
[3:31:16] Hwilly2o: i mean alliance

[3:33:30] BraerHZ: and no weekly caps
[3:33:32] Zawyer: I dont see the problem with that. For a low geared player, it would take SOOO many weeks to fully upgrade all gear to 220
[3:33:36] smashwow: @Towelliee should M+ have a 226 or 233 option tied to 18s or 20s
[3:33:37] PacioliNB: It will get there as the numbers continue to fade
[3:33:46] sdpercussion: wtf do you need 220 gear for if you aren't doing 15's or higher?
[3:33:48] dimensionalone: lol im looking for a carry
[3:33:50] Finarato: I don't really get it man, just give people gear. I don't care if you're 226 or not it doesn't make you suddenly capable of doing 20+
[3:33:52] Alegnowar: watch out that Elitist Redditors and Wow forums users are coming for u

[3:34:17] sdpercussion: ya
[3:34:20] kashmara: I'm at 195 and I don't m+/raid, so I'll likely stay at this level until 9.1

[3:43:37] chrispape: thought it was less health for tank/heal specs

[3:44:39] Kromede: did somebody say TBC? https://www.darklegacycomics.com/764 KEKW

[3:48:58] Spankmetank: it was the torghast quest to saave the npc you picked up
[3:49:01] jontejo: the revenous anima orb gives everyone 250 anima if you're in a group, but if you use it on the trader in a solo run it gives you 400 anima instead to still make it worth buying in a solo run

[3:56:11] Leoric86: @Finarato Its not a regional problem, its the place you go or food problem. There are plenty of places with spring rolls that are not soggy, you just need to find them obviously.

[4:27:08] Putcride: Did you try reaper of souls?
[4:27:11] 91Niki: I've never played any other Diablo than D3. So I am excited for D2, cuz people say it's great
[4:27:22] MuttonChopins: most likely, it is made by the Crash Bandicoot and Tony Hawk 1 + 2 remake devs

[4:27:47] xluckydawgx: D2 is really just great
[4:27:48] Malarick: i may be looking through a rose colored plate helm but D2 was amazing.
[4:27:50] TheCliffyShow: Only Diablo I've played is 3.
[4:28:04] 91Niki: Yeah same
[4:28:15] Hwilly2o: EQOA?

[4:28:19] 91Niki: I was like "wait is this D4? it looks worse than D3" LUL
[4:28:24] 91Niki: I am excited for the story tho!
[4:28:29] MuttonChopins: D2 devs look more hype about working on the remake imo
[4:28:49] mavericks312: what up towel
[4:29:12] Shrenko: its not D2 devs thats working on the remake, its a different company/studio
[4:29:18] j_bar111: with all the remakes and classic and remasters
[4:29:22] j_bar111: its crazy

[4:30:11] Scubaskot: @Towelliee there are so many remakes bc the gaming culture is stuck, like all culture.
[4:30:11] PokerFaceMoose: demo shout
[4:30:47] GamerKillance: Until we get VR MMORPG's are more or less a dying breed. Not where the money is now
[4:30:53] chukudu: chukudu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! <3 you T-man
[4:30:55] 91Niki: Honestly remaking an old game with better graphics, if the game was good, i actually find that cool.
[4:31:09] neverbornlucky: wow VR will kill WOW
[4:31:15] j_bar111: Dont forget fleshcraft Towelliee
[4:31:16] Scubaskot: @Towelliee im was not refeering to MMOs in perticular but all the genre
[4:31:18] Finarato: I applaud star wars for trying and making a great game but it was a single player game hidden in a decent MMO.
[4:31:21] chrslp: MMOs already peaked imo. Theyre all on damage control to keep players in
[4:31:41] 91Niki: I wish someone would make a great remake of Jazz Jackrabbit. Like a legit good remake
[4:31:42] MuttonChopins: I dont think VR games arent gonna become mainstream until probably a decade imo
[4:32:00] TheGaoSora: Idk, you need to do a VR mmo REALLY good for it to be successful.. not to mention your avatar becomes meaningless once you go full 1st person
[4:32:02] therealhotwheels: Because new RPGs are not even comparable to the OG ones. There are catering to people who don't want to read, spend a lot of time in it, or make decisions.
[4:32:04] reborune22: theres alot of good ones coming out
[4:32:29] chrslp: Arma BR was best Kappa
[4:32:29] MuttonChopins: Apex Legends is pretty cool with that
[4:32:32] Scubaskot: @Towelliee theres no  improvement in the gaming culture in the past 20 years, VR gaming had a chance but it sucks
[4:33:01] mavericks312: AR
[4:33:01] TheGaoSora: AR?
[4:33:02] Deekan33: AR
[4:33:03] PokerFaceMoose: augmented reality
[4:33:04] j_bar111: augmented
[4:33:04] ItzBeardMan: augomented reality
[4:33:10] TheGaoSora: XR?
[4:33:22] GamerKillance: We don't have the tech to make cheap VR or AR stiff yet
[4:33:37] 91Niki: Technology just isn't there yet to make those things good yet. At least not in an affordable manner
[4:33:42] MuttonChopins: So like in the movie Ready Player One?
[4:33:46] mavericks312: VR was always gonna be just a phase nothing crazy
[4:34:19] FinalState2: just need more HP
[4:34:20] Aidler: a few days ago it was predicted that Apple will release AR contact lenses in the 30s ... so in around 10 years
[4:34:41] therealhotwheels: Screw the guys that hit you and make you fly. I can't even tell you how many times they threw me off the edge!!
[4:34:55] Scubaskot: @Towelliee the only improvment in the last 20 years of gaming culture is the graphics, thats it. nothing revolutionary, unlike it was btw 1980-2000
[4:35:04] 91Niki: Yeah sorry, I am not putting any apple products in my eyes.

[4:38:35] j_bar111: @TacoVendor93 something like that, not a healer but like buffs and slows that kind of thing
[4:38:35] GamerKillance: I mean look at what Genshin Impact did. We need more stuff like that tbh
[4:39:08] mavericks312: so anime botw?
[4:39:12] MuttonChopins: what did Genshin Impact do?
[4:39:22] TheGaoSora: Yeah torgahst is so not anime..
[4:39:28] mavericks312: genshin is just like everyother gatcha game
[4:39:39] RocketMan23: ya but thats a game entirely designed as a rogue lite vs a system in a much larger game
[4:39:45] Gruffian: A debuff support class would be cool.

[4:41:54] Zarinna2015: How does it work in groups, with the anima cells? Do people not see each others anima cells?

[5:41:02] Smeerzak: I would play TBC if they added a WoW token :)
[5:41:02] SittingCoach: i am not following, why wow token?
[5:41:04] N3llee: Towel is 100% on point here
[5:41:06] ForklyftTV: Most raiders in Classic buy gold because its there only option due to bots
[5:41:10] Xailen: They would never hire more people to fight bots LUL
[5:41:11] JoeyBagadonuts: tokens are in retail and the botting is crazy there too
[5:41:17] headshotb1lly: we bomers want quick gold, cant avoid it
[5:41:18] khronick1904: I'm fine with WoW tokens if it kills the botting

[5:41:28] okEllen: POGGERS
[5:41:29] SageRuskiy: botting on retail is really non comparative compared to classic
[5:41:31] Redbearded16: Classic Andy’s will get passed at botters but hate the idea of the wow token. Unfortunately Big T is 100% right
[5:41:40] alfa_202: reddit: /r/burningcrusade
[5:41:58] Ultratide_: Botting on retail is insane dont even try to say its not lol
[5:42:10] Treir44: how does a token prevent botting
[5:42:17] SittingCoach: some1 care to explain how wow tokens gonna fix it? i am not following =(
[5:42:28] Plague_GG: you can sell it for gold @treir44
[5:42:33] junkrat_sky: towHorde
[5:42:36] Typh166: agree redbeard to be honest classic andy's prob the biggest reason I dont get into classic as much.
[5:42:49] Treir44: @plague_seraph but gold sellers still sell gold way cheaper than tokens on retail and its still huge
[5:42:57] Lasercookiee: I dont understand how wow tokens will stop botting?
[5:43:09] Alegnowar: i bet u have one too in ur mail towel Kappa

[5:43:11] N3llee: it looks and reads legit ... if its fake its a damn good one
[5:43:22] myguyhood: "all blizzard employees" seems fake af lol
[5:43:24] Redbearded16: The token Is a deterrent not a flat fix. With another way to get gold other than buying from gold sellers it reduces the demand from gold sellers since you get spend 20 bucks in the store
[5:43:25] SonofHorus82: I've seen these GIANT packs of mage bots farming areas in EPL and Badlands. I have seen botting in retail, but not to the extent that people are doing it in classic.\
[5:43:37] SilkeySmooth: knowing blizzard at the end of the month
[5:43:40] shimwood: Spooder WutFace
[5:44:15] Dukkoti: i think that they should take all the mounts from the pasts dungeon and raid with the same drop rate and put them into torghast as well as the BFA island stuff. that will get more peeps into torgrast for sure
[5:44:25] Ultratide_: Botting is just as bad in retail... make a druid and goto moonglade
[5:44:27] myguyhood: i mean call of duty has the worst cheating community and blizzard so nothing about it, so im not expecting anything for WoW either
[5:44:32] Treir44: fuckin jagex does so much better with botting on runescape than blizzard
[5:44:36] SonofHorus82: @Towelliee I know what you mean and I agree with you. I was more replying to the people that are saying "botting happens in retail too."
[5:44:40] N3llee: I hate the idea of a token in classic or TBC but its the only thing that will keep botting in check
[5:44:45] SilkeySmooth: @Towelliee you have botting in retail with the token so i dont think a token in tb will deture botting
[5:44:50] cwagrant: Have you seen the moonkin bot farms?
[5:45:00] Treir44: @Towelliee they still buy gold from gold sellers on retail
[5:45:03] Lasercookiee: ah I see
[5:45:06] Ultratide_: Lol botting is still huge in retail towellie
[5:45:06] MuttonChopins: CoD and WoW are made by different companies @b0yyy
[5:45:08] Treir44: idk why you act like people dont because of token
[5:45:10] N3llee: @SilkeySmooth it will.. it may not stop  it 100% it weill lessen its impact
[5:45:15] N3llee: Just as it did in retail
[5:45:22] mlftw: you are so wrong, Retail got loads of botters wth :D @Towelliee
[5:45:26] BigJohnnyLove: who actually thinks the token stops botting? and why?
[5:45:31] SageRuskiy: They also banned multiboxing software, do not forget that!
[5:45:32] N3llee: When the token was first relist
[5:45:35] ForklyftTV: @Towelliee ive raided all of classic ALOT of raiders buy gold already, the token just changes where it comes from and gets rid of bots
[5:45:42] TheRiwen: 1000
[5:45:44] Ultratide_: absolutely incorrect take, make a druid and goto moonglade right now @Towelliee
[5:45:44] VenutianSpring: go look west of theatre of pain 100% youll find bots
[5:45:51] mayhemguy: hey @Towelliee
[5:45:58] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee did you not see asmongold showing the ridiculous amount of botters farming shit in BFA zones? lol
[5:46:06] Xailen: I know where to find some bots in retail lol
[5:46:08] SilkeySmooth: @N3llee it mite make botting worse everyone with extra money to buy mats off the ah
[5:46:08] Treir44: but botters dont have to be there

[5:46:38] Kromede: farming Tahonta, seeing a lot
[5:46:44] Ultratide_: Just goto moonglade rn if you think botting is not real in retail @Towelliee
[5:46:47] TiredCarcass: classic by a mile
[5:46:48] dernybaggins: Bananas to bacons
[5:46:51] N3llee: @SilkeySmooth nope.. because the price of the token is controlled by blizz/player and its not longer worth it for botting companies
[5:46:55] Masqerader: i only see botters up by where the world boss is in bastion and I drag a bunch of elites to them and get them killed
[5:46:59] rambo1156: true
[5:47:03] SageRuskiy: @Gruffian why? Wouldnt that let them get ganked?
[5:47:05] Treir44: @N3llee ur wrong people buy gold all the time
[5:47:06] idenkaz_: if you have the actual numbers yeah facts. but
[5:47:12] N3llee: Sure they do
[5:47:12] BigHatCheetah: Its just as bad but okay
[5:47:14] Gruffian: Botters farm that field by Theater of Pain all the time
[5:47:16] N3llee: Not denying that
[5:47:18] Treir44: @N3llee its way cheaper than a token
[5:47:21] raldrik: it is destroying the price of herbs
[5:47:23] dimofodi: You can just put the bot on follow :D
[5:47:24] raldrik: and skinning
[5:47:26] Gruffian: @sage_ruskiy Less people play WM on, so less people to report them.
[5:47:26] SilkeySmooth: @N3llee just buy wow gold on retail
[5:47:28] RunningOutOfRAM: @Towelliee bots in retail are bad since they bring prices down and hurt blizzard pockets :D
[5:47:33] N3llee: Bottom line is wow token reduced botting 100% in retail
[5:47:39] SilkeySmooth: never
[5:47:41] N3llee: I did not stop it
[5:47:45] MuttonChopins: since asmongold streamed LULW
[5:47:47] N3llee: but it had a very large impact
[5:47:57] VictorAvalanche: botters do not effect blizz pockets.
[5:48:04] N3llee: in the profitability for people trying to IRL profit from botting
[5:48:07] Masqerader: more bots in diablo 3 than in WOW retrail
[5:48:11] Masqerader: retail
[5:48:15] Intrilo: No botters?, just go to moonglade and you will see nonstop druids running after the same script LULW
[5:48:22] Ultratide_: @Intrilo he wont LUL
[5:48:24] idenkaz_: laughs in Eu draenor.
[5:48:28] myguyhood: retail is not fine lol
[5:48:35] BigJohnnyLove: using blizzard forum posts as evidence for a measure of botting KEKW
[5:48:36] SilkeySmooth: the token needs to sell for more
[5:48:38] Treir44: moonglade does have l;like 50 druids on every server
[5:49:00] tylerm1031: Classic is just fine how it is my man
[5:49:10] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[5:49:18] CritcobainTV: can't tell if trolling
[5:49:30] TheGaoSora: @SilkeySmooth True
[5:49:32] N3llee: No matter how you want to slice it.. the WoW token had a significant impact on the amount of bots in retail. It did not stop it 100% but it saw and continues to see a significant reduction.
[5:49:49] tylerm1031: lol it’s just how it was originally. That’s why is classic
[5:49:50] uberhart: classic is awful because of bots and minmax
[5:49:54] mlftw: you are so wrong here, there are so many clips of botters on retail @Towelliee
[5:50:03] N3llee: omg people
[5:50:06] tylerm1031: If you don’t like it play retail
[5:50:09] Jared948: wow tokens will cause a massive inflation
[5:50:09] N3llee: you will never get rid of bots 100%
[5:50:10] okEllen: MrDestructoid No bot issue.
[5:50:11] warrenny: The way to stop botting in bc is notrekease bc 😂
[5:50:14] CritcobainTV: Yeah. Nothing crazy, but some
[5:50:14] Intrilo: Botting in retail is exactly the same as in Classic, it's just that the Retail wow world is so much bigger you don't see them as often as you do in Classic. Problem is just as big in both games. @Towelliee NotLikeThis
[5:50:21] MOLAR305: why did China classic get token? because they wanted to alleviate the botting
[5:50:23] Wulfgrym: One or two suspicious things
[5:50:23] Treir44: bot scripts are a lot better in 2021\
[5:50:24] N3llee: its about managing it
[5:50:39] SonofHorus82: @Towelliee I've not seen any yet, but I'm still in the damn Barrens.
[5:50:39] CritcobainTV: LUL
[5:50:42] KingSlayerYotam: i miss isboxer days
[5:50:45] Masqerader: that is just a druid mating ritual, pay no attention to that
[5:50:47] Xailen: best way to stop botting is to remove click to move. lol
[5:50:51] hoodvoker: @Intrilo that's not the same impact though
[5:51:01] AlexIncorporated: Just get Todd Howard to email then asking for an apology
[5:51:03] Treir44: @Xailen bots dont use click to move anymore
[5:51:20] Treir44: u clearly have no idea how scripts work
[5:51:24] Xailen: only a botter would know that Kappa
[5:51:27] N3llee: yea people who think the wow token did nothing in terms of disrupting botting is completely uneducated on the matter
[5:51:45] TheRiwen: china has a lot of bots

[6:20:04] Bourdainism: what was the quarter drop this time?
[6:20:05] SilkeySmooth: everybody getting 2 legendaries would bring tons of people back
[6:20:09] khronick1904: I love retail, just disappointing seeing what they did to the game when they see what actually works. stop dumbing down the game for the minority
[6:20:11] jacooners: wod here we come
[6:20:11] Gorestack: I know what will save Shadowlands, more systems
[6:20:18] lieutenantdan416: dont sell yourself short towelie :)
[6:20:36] magemaster225: theyll take the wrong lessons from it, like they'll say the reason for the dropoff is lack of titanforging and corruption
[6:20:40] desmo7: Wait sf is not doing good??
[6:21:01] Bourdainism: @Towelliee What was the dropoff this quarter?

[6:21:23] TheGaoSora: oh my
[6:21:34] desmo7: Shadowlands is not doing good? I thought ppl loved it (I don’t play wow)
[6:21:42] aloken1312: theres a lot to do now too but its just not fun enough
[6:21:54] VictorAvalanche: i kinda hate to say this but Islands > Torghast =/
[6:22:02] jamarky23: That was the honeymoon phase
[6:22:07] Holysal: world first raiders seems to love it
[6:22:07] Reinkaos999: I miss legion
[6:22:18] TheUnknowing: shadowlands sounded great, but it just missed the mark
[6:22:18] Bourdainism: Classic is still going good :D
[6:22:18] Wulfgrym: boils down to no good
[6:22:20] jamarky23: @Reinkaos999  Word brother!
[6:22:25] Laelas_sm: it really is a matter of "you think u do but you dont"
[6:22:35] SilkeySmooth: the missed on torghast with no xmogs or lots of achievements
[6:22:40] Madnezz123: do you think more people will play m+ with 9.0.5?
[6:22:42] theoriginalzinng: i was stoked about torghast and now its worse than visions
[6:22:42] lieutenantdan416: everyone ever hates having to do torghast every week
[6:22:46] battlejoe: so are you bored of shadowlands
[6:22:56] khronick1904: blizzard needs to bring back everything people love about classic and move forward from there. bring back old talents
[6:22:56] Wulfgrym: classic
[6:22:57] Typh166: Yup
[6:22:58] the_sleepy1: it is very lackluster and a snooze feast if you play for more than 2 hours a day
[6:22:59] Typh166: for sure
[6:23:13] jamarky23: Our future is the past. In tbc and D2 remaster we trust!
[6:23:22] TheGaoSora: that'll explain the drop rates...
[6:23:31] feherlofia123: shadowlands had a good launch , i loved the zones all that jazz... but 4 months in it falls short
[6:23:41] metavahn231: they are trying to get people to hate classic by making retail with bad loot
[6:23:47] VictorAvalanche: PopCopy
[6:23:47] mctwist__: I got bored with SL real fast because of how little loot dropped.  I went three weeks without a single piece
[6:23:52] the_sleepy1: you said it best months ago..  They took the Slot machines out of the casino
[6:23:55] lieutenantdan416: joining this expansion later then release it is impossible to catch up its driving me nuts
[6:23:56] jacooners: honestly though its the dumb systems they have like grinding torghast for legos is annoying its not fun at all and neither is getting zero loot for m+
[6:23:57] Gorestack: rewards are not the problem, lack of content outside of dungeons and raids is
[6:23:58] abbosss: D:
[6:23:58] Guillin: Problem is Blizzard saw how well Classic has gone and thought that would work with the modern style. That an reinventing the wheel every expansion doesn’t help
[6:24:03] Naturalbeef: To be fair, we all thought we wanted less loot
[6:24:04] MuttonChopins: Lets give them Anima instead - John Hight LULW
[6:24:05] SssnakePliskin: spell control.... for the children
[6:24:14] Madnezz123: theres a reason wow moved on from classic. Why should they go back
[6:24:15] TiredCarcass: no way
[6:24:16] aloken1312: Blizzard almost nailed it and then suddenly at the last moment the nail slipped off and they hit their own thumb
[6:24:17] TheGaoSora: And lets reward pvp more, for some reason! that'll make the majority happy
[6:24:20] JHaPlays: JHaPlays subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! towPurple
[6:24:27] Aidler: I was never too excited about SL. the first trailer was bonkers though
[6:24:28] theoriginalzinng: everybody wants lots of loot
[6:24:29] VictorAvalanche: No we did not want less loot, we wanted Warforge/titanforge gone
[6:24:30] lekkahdh: No the fuck we didn't
[6:24:32] Shrenko: actually some people did
[6:24:35] metavahn231: only the minority didnt want warforge

[6:25:01] aloken1312: blizzard is punishing us for wanting stuff like a bad parent
[6:25:12] Aidler: I never wanted less loot. hell I liked WF and TF

[6:25:38] the_sleepy1: Without the casual players wow retail is dead
[6:25:39] Madnezz123: shadowlands loot system killed m+
[6:25:47] metavahn231: this system is just bad, why did they make M+ have worse drops rates and low ilvl
[6:25:49] grizzlyhorn: im closer to quitting 9.0 than i was to quitting 8.3
[6:25:49] illi333: ya and where is asmongold now
[6:25:51] Madnezz123: where is he now? LUL
[6:25:52] Thaildras: They said it'll make loot more interesting but forgot to make loot interesting, the trinkets are naff, the weapons are bland (barely a proc in sight and no tier sets that act as a soft nerf to content.
[6:25:52] VictorAvalanche: haha
[6:25:59] Shrenko: he dipped long ago
[6:26:00] TheUnknowing: Yeah well you shouldn't listen to asmon for any advice lol

[6:26:33] abbosss: asmon literally gets carried in every type of content there is, idk why anyone would listen to someone like that
[6:26:34] Aidler: I always said. listen to the bad players because they are the majority and pay the bills
[6:26:44] TheGaoSora: after he "did" LUL
[6:26:54] TheGaoSora: he was carried hard most likely LUL
[6:27:01] metavahn231: im sorry but id rather grind azerite than have a useless system like anima
[6:27:02] MuttonChopins: I like asmongold more in his alt stream than main stream
[6:27:02] khronick1904: asmon is cringe and gets carried for everything

[6:29:59] SonofHorus82: is that an alliance player? That's an alliance mount.

[6:30:21] jacooners: does anyone look forward to the maw or torghast every week?
[6:30:32] doomester: @Towelliee they cant just hit arthas button without backing it up with a story

[7:08:12] Sandisy: needs to be tuned around someone that has a job and maybe a wife and such. tune for hardcore = failed game
[7:08:58] SonofHorus82: yeah no way am I playing a game for that long that I dont have already have an invested interest in. I've been playing Warcraft since Orcs vs Humans so I was already ready built for WoW. Same kind of thing with SWTOR and LOTRO.

[7:10:30] Aedarax: isnt ashes also sub based?
[7:10:42] Ambersulfr: OK I'm not paying that much money for alpha/beta access if it's going to take me 6 months to even get established... I only play 2 hours a night.
[7:10:45] Ambersulfr: ;-;
[7:10:55] siszle: he did make bags and sent them out today
