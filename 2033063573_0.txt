[3:05:55] Zenlyn: u could argue for things like hpala and hpriest and fw a faster meta is more beneficial for them. U could prob make an arguement to buff primary stat again
[3:06:02] Zenlyn: its like choosing which healers aer good that way i guess
[3:06:06] coldgrayrain: i feel like every game i heal i have a chance to die in any cc i get put in
[3:06:25] dawsonator171: I think more dam would actually be able to punish these glass cannon healer rdruids.
[3:08:07] Zenlyn: I guess it just depends what kind of pvp you want. Buffing hp just makes set up comps worse, atleast if ur not buffing dmg that way right?
[3:08:29] omkar3108: PogChamp
[3:08:48] Drathimos: we've had so much tuning and it hasnt changed the fact that rdruids have been op ever since they got treants
[3:09:09] chancywilson: a treant is a healing totem
[3:09:15] Briggsy22: nerf treants but give them more treants
[3:09:21] Briggsy22: i wanna see them look like a demo lock
[3:09:38] Zenlyn: I actually believe that mana should be normalized and every healer should be kinda the same in terms of mana output. but thats a whole diff discussion
[3:10:37] Zenlyn: Yeah
[3:11:04] Zenlyn: My weird idea would be to change dampening to mana increase, because healing in dampening is SO boring, im mostly talking 2s and shuffle here though
[3:11:29] Zenlyn: its so anti fun to deal with damp, i think dealing with it that way wouldnt affect pve
[3:12:17] jBeastwood: What if they increased dam by 2% and healing by 1% instead of damp? Or something like that?
[3:12:22] Zenlyn: but when im saying all this, this is in the mind of a avg player, not just top 0.1% and the most feedback i get is "After 2-3 mins it feels like all my fun is taken away from me because of dampening "
[3:13:46] thefax_: every comp should just be an rmp comp 3 goes its over
[3:13:49] Zenlyn: Yeah, i wonder what the avg DF s3 game length is, i dont think its above 2 min tho
[3:13:51] Zenlyn: ye i meant in 2s and shuffle
[3:13:54] Zenlyn: 3's is fine a bit i think
[3:14:52] Allomaternal: what changes do you think sub rogue could use?
[3:15:41] Zenlyn: -50% damage while in duel, that'd fix alot of issues with sub i think
[3:15:56] Zenlyn: for the masses i mean
[3:15:58] Allomaternal: yeah i dont want anything to be overnerfed because i do feel bad when someones favorite spec gets gutted
[3:16:03] Allomaternal: i main assa myself
[3:16:34] Allomaternal: do you feel removing the vanish cdr could help? even shadowy duel
[3:16:40] samalycs: shammy tool kit be bussing tho
[3:16:46] samalycs: if used properly
[3:17:05] Allomaternal: yeah those seasons when sub is a cc bot basically only
[3:17:17] dawsonator171: I
[3:17:24] dawsonator171: am going to get you a 5 why ladder
[3:17:29] dawsonator171: I expect it filled out.
[3:18:00] Drathimos: tier sets create too much chaos for pvp balancing. they should just give us pvp tier set that stays the same season to season.
[3:18:31] Allomaternal: its just that they have so many ways to force a trinket and then being able to dip out with double vanish
[3:19:28] FameQT: make a decision between smokebomb and duel would be a good starting point
[3:19:38] Allomaternal: cheap shot on cd maybe?
[3:20:01] dawsonator171: Honestly, if they required energy pooling like in previous expacs.
[3:20:58] Szain3: DinoDance
[3:21:24] dawsonator171: In the current iteration of rogue, there's a ton of energy cost reduction in dance. So the sky is the limit to how much they can fit in a short window. If you would remove some of the stealth energy reduction talents, and potentially push them to requiring haste in order to get the max in a shadow dance. That to me is a reasonable change.
[3:21:35] samalycs: how do you feel ab rsham ?
[3:22:07] dawsonator171: you'd cut the damage potentially by limiting the amount of finishers they could fit in, or they would have to haste stack to get it in there.
[3:22:37] Moobot: Please be sure to ask permission before posting links in chat! (@Zenlyn)
[3:22:42] Zenlyn: o oops
[3:23:48] Zenlyn: U'd either need full redesign or do weird shit like buff rupture by a fk ton or bff backstab etc
[3:23:56] taeho77: Do you know if arms warriors want to get 4pc still at lower ilvl, or is it better to go 2pc and have higher pvp ilvl (from conq sets)?
[3:24:06] chancywilson: im okay with there being some high skill cap classes
[3:24:08] atoker: they'd have to buff back stab by a lot then
[3:24:18] eMBeaR64oz: madden gameplay again
[3:24:28] Pwnyo808: The fact that sub can 100-0 in the stun chain is insane.  If you ever trinket against sub you just die.  So you almost don't even have a trinket cuz it's a huge game of chicken
[3:24:32] dawsonator171: I think that's a massive gaslight honestly, because you need to get down to the base data. You're missing on many factors including saturation at that level.
[3:24:35] jBeastwood: yeah why not have high skill curve classes for those who choose to pursue it
[3:24:36] chancywilson: and low skill cap they should just be upfront. Like rank the class 1-3 stars of difficulty
[3:24:43] atoker: dance mulitpliers could get hit too, and a nerf to blades
[3:24:47] Zenlyn: I dont agree @Pwnyo808
[3:24:50] dawsonator171: That post is complete horse shit, because you're missing too much.
[3:24:55] samalycs: what do you think ab the skill cap on Rsham
[3:24:56] Pwnyo808: But that's only the best of the best rogues.  The stuns and cc is what make it feel oppressive
[3:25:06] Pwnyo808: @zenlyn how so?
[3:25:52] Zenlyn: because it's not a 1v1 game, its not as simple as ur putting it i think. he cant just 100-0 you every stun dr, there's a huge amount of factors
[3:25:52] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:25:59] atoker: I used to wreck rogue mage in 2s, but now rogues can solo my dh and warrior easily
[3:26:16] smccart: @Zenlyn duel/smokebomb>
[3:26:18] smccart: ?
[3:26:19] Pwnyo808: @zenlyn that's fair.  But if someone trinkets you die in duel
[3:26:35] dawsonator171: league has the problem of many micro bugs with champions, which makes maining them super important. Look at Riven pre-wall jump where players that were good at wall jumps could dive fights and slide out.
[3:26:36] whspe: take out physical immune cloak lol
[3:26:45] atoker: blur and parry would have to work from behind
[3:26:53] Pwnyo808: Honestly. If rogues defensive were weaker it'd be fine.  Counter pressure could help
[3:27:36] Exxtinctiion: Exxtinctiion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[3:27:36] StreamElements: Exxtinctiion just subscribed for 6 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[3:27:40] Zenlyn: Riot just tries to balance every champ to be AROUND 50% winrate as best as possible. but i dont think blizz does the same with the data they have
[3:27:45] Zenlyn: they just wing it with the community feedback
[3:27:46] Zenlyn: which is bad i think
[3:27:54] taeho77: @notmes - do you know if arms wars still want 4pc, even at cost of 470ilvl vs getting 489 pvp ilvl?
[3:28:04] dawsonator171: riot doesn't balance every champ, they design a meta.
[3:28:31] taeho77: rip ad
[3:28:48] Zenlyn: irelia?
[3:28:51] atoker: leblanc?
[3:28:52] furtif_69: aphelios?
[3:29:05] KlausNeda: zed
[3:30:03] Drathimos: playing rogue is miserable in shuffles. your teammates rush out of the gate and never let you sap. they constantly put things on stun dr. they never assist your go's, etc
[3:30:05] dawsonator171: you're really looking to limit the maximum of what they can do, because it's absurd.
[3:30:17] Pwnyo808: I feel like if you made rogue less tanky it wouldn't really fuck up low rating.  People aren't really that clean with defensive lower.
[3:30:29] dawsonator171: the sap doesn't matter in shuffle, only the stun DRs do.
[3:30:47] chancywilson: i feel like rogues use alt of def offensively
[3:30:56] kzloxxx: Rogues = hero class.
[3:30:57] chancywilson: like cloak for a kill or evas to avoid stun
[3:31:02] dawsonator171: sap only matters in constructed because you're coordinating multiple go options on opener.
[3:31:07] serratedlove: remove shadowy duel and make sub pick between vanish cdr or 2 vanishes
[3:31:08] Zenlyn: wouldnt do anything i think
[3:31:15] kzloxxx: They generate combo points by using cheap shot, it's insane
[3:31:23] Zenlyn: they would still pick both
[3:31:32] Likerra: @amaiyumebaka Shadowy duel is actually so unfun it's insane
[3:31:42] Zenlyn: look at old thiefs bargain
[3:31:44] Zenlyn: it was -30% hp right
[3:31:50] whspe: you cant hit rogues to begin with
[3:31:50] Zenlyn: and they were immortal?
[3:31:53] whspe: why do they care about health
[3:32:05] sean_spelled_like_seen: i just want duel gone
[3:32:06] atoker: I think they should let us stack a relentless trinket or adapt trinket with the medallion, but people think that's a bad idea
[3:32:07] Zenlyn: in legion, it made vanish 30 sec cd
[3:32:07] jBeastwood: Duel and bomb should be a choice node
[3:32:13] Zenlyn: it was either 20 or 30%
[3:32:15] eMBeaR64oz: have it cost the entire energy bar
[3:32:16] sean_spelled_like_seen: i don't really care abt anything else
[3:32:26] Zenlyn: Yeah, dont you remember in legion
[3:32:30] Zenlyn: rogues having 30 sec vanish?
[3:32:34] smccart: cdr, double vanish, cloak immunity
[3:33:02] taeho77: anyone know how to get the 489 ilvl trait in the tier set pieces?
[3:33:06] Pwnyo808: @notmes what if the more combo points rogue used the more damage they took?  Like a damage modifier based on that.
[3:33:24] jBeastwood: you can't run thieves + duel + bomb + cloak immunity
[3:33:31] serratedlove: make cheap shot a 5 sec cd
[3:33:56] Zenlyn: Maybe u could buff cheapshots duration but make it either cost something or not spammable
[3:34:20] smccart: does blizzard even care is the other question imo
[3:34:22] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[3:35:04] ChumpSeason: i'd settle for them taking gouge away from sub
[3:35:18] Zenlyn: My partner rat says just gut cdr, put dmg reduction on duel. tldr just make them killable because he thinks nerfing their damage and offensive utility more does pretty much nothing if they are immortal
[3:35:50] IamWalnuts: blizzard could just removed the cdr from rogue, remove double step. make dance sub only and reduce gouge to 2 seconds then tuned their damage
[3:35:56] Pwnyo808: @zenlyn completely agree.  The fact that they just don't take damage is the problem
[3:36:00] IamWalnuts: also yeah remove duel
[3:36:02] Zenlyn: atleast in thug we use duel in a completely different manner
[3:36:07] Zenlyn: we use it to extend CC
[3:36:10] ChumpSeason: @Zenlyn i hate cdr in general. got way out of hand last couple of xpacs
[3:36:13] atoker: in rbgs you play duel bomb and cloak talents
[3:36:25] jBeastwood: assa rogues die
[3:36:28] Allomaternal: make them think about it is the right wording LOL
[3:36:31] jBeastwood: less cdr, no double vanish
[3:36:54] Allomaternal: @jBeastwood yeah as assa, im always targeted in shuffle lol
[3:36:54] kzloxxx: removing cheap shop would be awesome already
[3:36:59] kzloxxx: cheap shot*
[3:37:07] whspe: it feels so bad when a rogue opens with cheapshot into cloak
[3:37:10] whspe: and you have o counter play lol
[3:37:19] Pwnyo808: It would be like hunter being able to do damage out of turtle and be able to turtle again later
[3:37:32] Zenlyn: u think if we just kept rogues utility / damage as is but they were killable it'd be ok
[3:37:35] Zenlyn: YEAH
[3:37:36] Zenlyn: like wrath
[3:37:42] dawsonator171: I miss the days that if a rogue wanted to commit to triple cheap in a dance, they don't really do much damage.
[3:37:45] atoker: prep resets all cds in classic
[3:37:52] Zenlyn: so we agree cdr is a huge factor in its problem
[3:37:55] BigBrain_B: Whats the addon that shows names?
[3:38:02] IamWalnuts: on top of double vanish + subterfuge
[3:38:02] Kendakilla: what’s your opener in arenas? like ur usual rotation
[3:38:08] smccart: increase their global time Kappa
[3:38:24] KlausNeda: As a competition player, does Blizzard ever ask you for this kind of feedback?
[3:38:45] serratedlove: blades as a 1 min cd with full cp every global is too much
[3:38:47] Zenlyn: Actually maybe ye, u could prob fix a lot of stuff just by making energy classes have normal GCD's. cos people forget that energy classes are locked at 1.0 gcd
[3:39:04] SpeedyMcD: when blizz "reworks" classes now they want them to be extremely strong so people play them. it just the trend now they do with classes
[3:39:05] dawsonator171: finding a way to force them off of mastery, and into something like haste. Would be a great way to look at increasing sustained but lowering burst because of energy limitations in dance.
[3:39:13] KlausNeda: Correct, but if they don't have people understanding the depths of the game, maybe they should listen to people that do
[3:39:53] Pwnyo808: The fact that you can't trinket duel, and it works as an off dr cc is insane to me.
[3:39:53] michaelss_: you are the most level headed though, you advocate nerfs when you have one of the best rogues on your team
[3:39:54] AxiomDK: Blizzard could send a survey out to every 2.4+ player once a season but they dont
[3:40:01] dawsonator171: I feel like that energy is not a considered resource on rogue goes at all. They don't seem to be pooling it.
[3:40:01] samalycs: theres 101 ways to nerf rouge, just up to blizz at this point
[3:40:02] Zenlyn: Have u seen u dot gg (cant link or i get sent) and they try to use ladder and game data to make tier lists etc, its kind afun
[3:40:17] dawsonator171: !permit zenlyn
[3:40:17] StreamElements: @zenlyn, you will not get timed out for the next 60 seconds.
[3:40:17] Moobot: @dawsonator171 @Zenlyn will not get timed out for the next 3m (@dawsonator171)
[3:40:38] coldgrayrain: they make more money off of pet battles thaan pvp
[3:40:42] Zenlyn: https://u.gg/wow/tier-list/dps-rankings/pvp this one hahah
[3:40:53] IamWalnuts: they dont want to put any effort into a major redesign of a class when it effects maybe 2% of the population and thats probably high
[3:41:02] IamWalnuts: it just pulls resources away from other stuff
[3:41:13] dawsonator171: I thought realz was a priest
[3:41:33] dawsonator171: I also blame Hoodrych for everything. Kappa
[3:41:41] Zenlyn: Its the league website that now went to wow
[3:41:48] Pwnyo808: You don't get to a position like that and have bias involved
[3:41:59] Zenlyn: its taking data from games played and ladder etc
[3:42:21] dawsonator171: looks like it's considering saturation using blizzards API.
[3:42:58] dawsonator171: trying to dodge UH nerfs again mes.
[3:43:05] Zenlyn: i only knew they started doing wow cos liquid is sponsored by them now
[3:43:31] dawsonator171: it's got frost dk above outlaw
[3:43:33] samalycs: can u link that site in here
[3:43:34] IamWalnuts: am i missing the where its pulling these players from?
[3:43:49] Pwnyo808: How is the average rating so high
[3:43:50] danieltsmoke: I am dropping them 100 average rating, ha
[3:44:14] IamWalnuts: oh its above 2.1
[3:44:17] AxiomDK: Bigdam makes up 80% of all enhancement shamans
[3:44:20] IamWalnuts: i didnt see that
[3:44:23] IamWalnuts: on the page
[3:44:30] dawsonator171: I mean, between Zev and Axtin how many ferals do they have up there?
[3:44:38] smccart: it says feral is A tier but i never ever see them
[3:44:43] Zenlyn: But this also brings up another question, because this might seem funny but this is RAW data and i wonder if blizz look at similiar data and make assessments around it
[3:44:54] SpeedyMcD: when are they going to tune things again?
[3:45:27] JekylllMrHYDE: 2 raiders from JekylllMrHYDE have joined! 
[3:45:53] Zenlyn: not sure if u can do that
[3:45:54] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[3:45:57] JekylllMrHYDE: i know its not much but hope your haveing a good stream
[3:46:09] Pwnyo808: Buff mm
[3:46:57] AxiomDK: Should i only be playing necro bargain + no strang into Rdruids?
[3:47:23] Ojibeh: is it a weak arua that shows the names above players?
[3:47:34] IamWalnuts: have you gotten a legendary yet mes?
[3:48:06] AxiomDK: I hope i get mine this week
[3:48:11] IamWalnuts: its been confirmed you cant get it through vault right?
[3:49:02] Pwnyo808: @notmes if im.top 400 bm and mm where do you think that puts me %wise for each? (Solo shuffle)
[3:49:32] Pwnyo808: 1800 mm, 2100 bm
[3:49:33] serratedlove: @Pwnyo808 look yourself up on seramate and it says what % you are next to your rating
[3:49:48] Pwnyo808: I just started mm.last night
[3:49:57] Likerra: 2k cr as Pres in solo shuffle is like top 80 right now
[3:50:04] AxiomDK: It says there are 3678 BM Hunters above 1k rating on the ladder so you'll have to do the math
[3:51:09] Szain3: DinoDance
[3:51:10] Pwnyo808: Oh shit
[3:51:31] Pwnyo808: Wow it's only 8%, I figured it'd be way better than that
[3:51:37] Pwnyo808: Interesting
[3:51:45] Pwnyo808: Ya
[3:52:10] Pwnyo808: Oh idk, if it's all ss people or just ladder people
[3:53:00] shugguls: yep i got 3 war, 2 ww and 2 dks this season
[3:53:00] indithedog: do u hope they continue in an alt friendly direction
[3:53:02] Zenlyn: I think ppl who make so many chars (me included i have 16 priests) are ruining the ladder dont u think
[3:53:16] Zenlyn: i climb to x rating, then sit, then that mmr that i've siphoned out of the pool never sees the light of day again
[3:53:33] Kendakilla: when is your latest update unholy  guide from ?
[3:54:00] shugguls: @Zenlyn its a plan that works well though :)
[3:54:33] fatdckgary: mes i will literally pay you if you make a breakdown over fever build and talents to use on different comps etc
[3:55:30] indithedog: one was 4/6
[3:55:31] ohsomagical_: @Zenlyn  yes ur disgusting
[3:55:51] Degenr8t: what week do they remove conq cap
[3:56:08] AxiomDK: Get to a certain point and cant even play the game anymore
[3:56:21] AxiomDK: Sat in an hour and 30 min queue this morning
[3:56:40] Zenlyn: butu  cant stop people from making chars at the same time HAHA
[3:57:12] danieltsmoke: @notmes your accent is interesting. Aussie and american?
[3:57:15] serratedlove: tell that to Bigdam :^)
[3:57:26] Zenlyn: we need uhh whats it called
[3:57:28] Zenlyn: decay
[3:57:29] Zenlyn: yea
[3:57:33] ohsomagical_: ban everyone who has multiple priests
[3:57:42] healhut: rating decay should 100% be a thing imo
[3:58:14] amSLC: When you say high rating do you mean top 5%, top .5%?
[3:58:18] Zenlyn: what would u consider aggressive though, i think league has it good, every game u play gives u 1 week to play up to 3-4 weeks or u get like -50
[3:58:42] Zenlyn: in wow it'd have to be like 3 days or -100
[3:58:44] Zenlyn: HAHAH
[3:58:48] Pwnyo808: I'd queue way more but I'm scared of queueing hunter into melee lobbies
[3:58:57] redsalem: redsalem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Yooo
[3:58:57] StreamElements: redsalem just subscribed for 13 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[3:59:02] Pwnyo808: And just losing all my points
[3:59:41] Zenlyn: Yeah, if u were 2380 u cant decay more, but if ur below that u decay to the duelist minimum
[3:59:42] Zenlyn: that'd be good i think
[4:00:23] AxiomDK: How many spots are usually available for R1 Shuffle for DKs?
[4:00:32] AxiomDK: like 6, 7, 8?
[4:00:39] Pwnyo808: When I stopped queueing bm I was top 200, but I just can't bring myself to keep queueing it because of the chance of a shotty lobby.  I'd wait 40 minutes to go 2-4 and lose 30 points
[4:01:04] Zenlyn: Oh yeah
[4:01:06] Zenlyn: its rlly annoying
[4:01:15] Zenlyn: at the end of last season my new chars were 1950 mmr?
[4:01:25] shugguls: problem will be that ppl just play end of season too
[4:01:51] shugguls: so inflation based on vaults claimed?
[4:02:00] Zenlyn: Oh random vent, My chars that i played last season dont get completely reset and now they are chilling at 2400 mmr in full greens. I cannot play any char i played last season
[4:02:24] Zenlyn: another random vent, seasons shud be completely reset, not just -1k
[4:02:26] rickygglol: zenlyn i had the same thing, cant play the game after taking a break cus im rusty as hell
[4:02:32] krome2dadome: ily zenlyn
[4:02:44] Zenlyn: hi @krome2dadome
[4:03:05] krome2dadome: hi :)
[4:03:11] The_Queen_of_Ruin: Kromie. 👀 Zenlyn 👀
[4:03:40] Brenanners: as a healer or dps?
[4:03:45] shugguls: failed
[4:03:45] krome2dadome: queen :eyes:
[4:03:48] gkdlswm5: it feels like a success
[4:03:52] Drathimos: i would say success otherwise it wouldnt be popular
[4:03:53] Zenlyn: Hot take, i think the only way wow pvp survives the next 5-10 years is they focus on solo queue. there's too many reasons why people arent playing pvp. and partners should NOT be one of the biggest reason
[4:03:56] Alacay: solo is a huge success for healers. You can get so many games in to practice
[4:03:57] cixelp: I queued into a 2200 shuffle lobby last night on my priest with 0 rating and who didn't have enough sparks for precog. Not a fun lobby
[4:03:57] krome2dadome: failure imo
[4:04:00] rickygglol: big success. but i think could be even better if they figured out how to shorten queue times
[4:04:00] JanDeGrote1: Made it more accessible and that was the goal no
[4:04:01] Briggsy22: briggs 👀
[4:04:02] Brenanners: as a whole it failed to meet the mark of what people expected it to be
[4:04:05] Degenr8t: i can never find partners which has usually discouraged me from the game in the past when i come back to pvp, now i can actually play so i enjoy it
[4:04:06] redsalem: I mean I hate waiting but I hate lfg more so...
[4:04:09] ChumpSeason: pretty miserable experience as a healer, yet thats the only thing with a low wait time
[4:04:15] gkdlswm5: what if they get AI healers to reduce q times
[4:04:19] Pwnyo808: @notmes I love ss, but it feels so bad that I'm playing Russian roulette queueing as hunter.  I could lose 50 or gain 50 purely based on lobby.  It's why I don't queue bm anymore
[4:04:30] gkdlswm5: they can create r1 tier healers
[4:05:04] Zenlyn: noo but the whole landscape of gaming has changed, i have seen and heard too many people say they cant play because no partners // sit in lfg for little to nothing
[4:05:07] krome2dadome: @pwnyo808 that’s every class besides rogue
[4:05:12] Brenanners: pugs were always nearly impossible to find even b4 solo shuffle
[4:05:16] Zenlyn: s1 of SL was cos of pvers needing pvp
[4:05:18] Zenlyn: HUGE factor
[4:05:20] Drathimos: covid lockdown influx
[4:05:24] shugguls: S1 u got better pve gear in pvp
[4:05:42] Pwnyo808: @krome2dadome fair, it just feels scary as hunter.  I can queue a night and tank 300 points.  It'll take me days to get it all back
[4:05:50] Zenlyn: I guess i cant disagree, i just the whole solo queue experience should be nurtured
[4:05:58] Zenlyn: i just think *

[4:06:23] Pwnyo808: Or dk...which is all the ladder is atm
[4:06:45] rickygglol: yeah the rewards being separate in vault would be a good change
[4:06:48] rickygglol: feels bad going pve or pvp
[4:06:54] wardelswijk: but the upgrade system made pvers do pvp no?
[4:06:59] sean_spelled_like_seen: i hated having to expend honor for upgrades
[4:07:07] serratedlove: @rickygglol pvp being removed from vault next expac
[4:07:09] sean_spelled_like_seen: that was actually the worst
[4:07:29] wardelswijk: @amaiyumebaka ye thats a good thing
[4:07:30] Drathimos: shadowlands pvp gear gave you really good pve ilvl even in its final season. now the pvp gear gives you really crappy pve ilvls and the clunky crest system doesnt help
[4:07:37] wardelswijk: right now pver have to choose between pve / pvp gear
[4:07:43] Zenlyn: They have made so many improvements with pve gear though, its gna be so rare that pvp gear is gna boost participation
[4:07:46] deanoxs: i mean when you can get gear easy, i see no point having pvp gear in the vault
[4:08:07] the_audacity_x: @wardelswijk is that gonna be worse when they remove pvp from vault?
[4:08:22] Zenlyn: This raid tier u mean?
[4:08:57] Barradoso: @notmes i came back to WoW After dropping It in mop, shuffle were the only way i manager to find decent people, lfg Is literally useless
[4:09:06] IamWalnuts: the crab boss on mythic
[4:09:08] redsalem: I would be piping right now but I took a bit of a break and just don't feel like gearing. I'm old or lazy or both but by the time I take the time to gear I'm out of playtime and repeat
[4:09:09] IamWalnuts: was insane
[4:09:10] shugguls: there was no point in healers as every mechanic one shot u , lol
[4:09:45] rtcinema: It's interesting that M+/Mythic raiders can do any content in the game with no detriment, but PVPers have a worse time doing open world content or trying to raid with their PVP gear
[4:10:13] krome2dadome: @rtcinema 2nd class citizens
[4:10:19] rtcinema: I have 35% vers in my pve gear at 485 IL. Prolly could do BGs or arena just fine
[4:10:31] boltozor: testing testing
[4:10:43] redsalem: You can do normal dungeons in greens. You can't do pvp in greens.
[4:10:45] SpeedyMcD: what class do you hope gets reworked next
[4:10:45] the_audacity_x: once they remove vault for pvp will catalyst be the only way to get pvp tier gear?
[4:10:46] krome2dadome: fuck sub rogues
[4:10:51] Drathimos: they're still making game design choices revolve around world first raids. just look at how you cant even get the past two legendary drops until the first WF gets its mythic clear.
[4:10:51] Barradoso: Best wow content right now has to be M+, great ranking system and Easy ti find ppl
[4:10:52] boltozor: oh there it is, video took ages to load
[4:11:03] krome2dadome: fuck sub rogues
[4:11:23] sean_spelled_like_seen: M+ is always strong because it's a big draw for the game too, tbf
[4:11:32] wardelswijk: remove cheapshot from shadowdance
[4:11:33] wardelswijk: ez clap
[4:11:42] sean_spelled_like_seen: PvP barrier of entry includes, but is not restricted to: skill gap, gear, and toxicity
[4:11:46] krome2dadome: fuck sub rogues
[4:11:58] sean_spelled_like_seen: lotta whiney people in SS who talk smack all game
[4:13:11] Degenr8t: tusks of mannoroth dont exist im convinced

[4:14:38] krome2dadome: :)
[4:14:41] shugguls: hope so, looking forward to arms buff (3%)
[4:14:48] SolTeevo: wait theres blue posts on nerfs/buffs?
[4:15:08] SolTeevo: oh fair
[4:17:00] SolTeevo: i mean.. arguably i think dh gets another nerf lmfao
[4:17:07] shugguls: arms is last in pve damage so i predict a 3% just like ww got :)
[4:17:09] SolTeevo: i dont wanna see it happen.. but i feel it coming
[4:17:38] krome2dadome: loving that arms is so bad in pve rn
[4:17:49] SolTeevo: @krome2dadome is it?
[4:17:59] shugguls: soooo bad
[4:18:41] SolTeevo: yeah actually havnt seen many, if any arms warrs in 20s or higher
[4:18:46] malakaidh: forsurely destro gets somewhat of a nerf ya?
[4:18:58] SolTeevo: demo def deserves a bit of a nerf

[4:29:20] sean_spelled_like_seen: dev is repulsive, but if you just monitor dragon rage i feel like you can mitigate their pressure pretty effectively
[4:29:59] sean_spelled_like_seen: i hate seeing dh/dk on the ladder, but that's probably because i've been playing mostly arcane mage for main

[9:22:46] Solushun: cant be worse than season 1
[9:22:50] Solushun: adn season 1 i played with an ele
[9:22:57] goatedsp: all melee specs need to lose one mobility chargs (DH fel rush only 1 charge, warrior charge only 1 , only 1 monk roll etc) and all damage needs to be reduced overall
[9:23:43] Solushun: i dont mind the melee althought ret/DH seems rough based on small sample size lol
[9:24:18] reedthesham: @RankOnePDF not all melee
[9:24:27] foshiXD: I havent pvped since early december, is the legggo a good stat stick? and does the gap closer work in rated?
[9:24:29] goatedsp: ret isnt even melee anymore, literally their entire kit is ranged now. its LITERALLY a 0 IQ Class. and dh has 2 fel rush charges, felblade, and vengeful retreat. its pathetic
[9:24:38] reedthesham: Make enhance great again
[9:24:59] lzd_nsfl: pls never make enh good again
[9:25:02] lzd_nsfl: still ptsd from mop

[9:25:39] reedthesham: though this season's been harder to play with the baby
[9:25:41] foshiXD: i disagree @RankOnePDF ran into so many rets around 2.1 that sucked, never sanc/sac, never reset and just get hit. Its definitely lower skill cap but a good ret is so valuable
[9:25:47] reedthesham: factz mike
[9:26:16] Solushun: @reedthesham @Briggsy22 -1 alt part 2.0
[9:26:18] nikthevoker: fuck rogues
[9:27:27] goatedsp: devs play favorites, cloak of shadows 2 minute cooldown...why? vanish ....less than 2 minutes... why? its just favoritism when other specs have less defensives with longer cooldowns
[9:27:41] indithedog: is there ever a balanced version of rogue isnt it only broken or weak
[9:27:44] Solushun: Vintage and Morelli on Mes stream again OhMyDog
[9:27:52] Solushun: this really does feel like shadowlands
[9:28:11] reedthesham: Sol, I need you to carry me in 3s on one ofyour 14 druids

[9:29:49] nikthevoker: my DK is 67
[9:29:53] reedthesham: just a tweak
[9:30:05] reedthesham: mass % of rogues aren't great tbh
[9:30:26] stoffext: @notmes What exp do you feel dk where at their best?
[9:30:35] despised1: When is the best time to play solo?  Seems on NA in evening is all bots and impossible to play lol
[9:30:55] reedthesham: I hope they readjust the amount of defensives they have compared to my enhance :P
[9:31:02] reedthesham: took 14 years to get burrow
[9:31:03] nslime22: isnt ur teammate a rogue main?
[9:31:21] nikthevoker: ya its insane
[9:31:21] goatedsp: even if the game was perfectly balanced rogue would still be the best class due to the fact that they can exit combat and reset whenever they want, they play around their cooldowns and theres nothing you can do to stop it
[9:31:48] eMBeaR64oz: imagine if sham was bis right now

Any pro tips to get rid of this habbit and learn to use my keybinds instead? (Played since vanilla)  Do you have any good keybinds for targeting to share?
[10:49:15] Lilmizqt: i don't think he liked your present very much
