[1:45:06] Lostdogal: yeah, my wife got both and was fine really. My dad got covid and was almost a goner so I'll be getting the vaccine the second it's offered no matter what.
[1:45:07] CMOBB: It is supposed to be free.
[1:45:24] BetsyAndCo: it's free all over the world
[1:45:24] 無職提督: it might be free but u gotta wait ur turn
[1:45:40] SumZeroGG: catJAM
[1:45:49] 無職提督: as the production rate its not looking good
[1:45:50] CMOBB: if I am not mistaken a bill was passed making the vaccine free, but you know they will charge for other things.
[1:45:59] SumZeroGG: Silverhand Silverhand Silverhand
[1:46:18] Eriewst: People have been sharing links for signups and causing a CF
[1:46:24] Deathchampt: surly its free in the us?
[1:46:41] Lazugo: Yeah most of times is the "i know a guy " type of stuff
[1:46:49] swordwindgaming: Its free in the US but high risk people and front liners go first
[1:46:49] CMOBB: Dr. office will charge you for the visit and the time for the staff.
[1:46:50] BetsyAndCo: it is because there as shots left at the end of the day, they have to be used up in 4 hours. So people being offered if they are at the clinics
[1:46:52] nihilistic_bat: the one free thing in healthcare we get
[1:46:54] Eriewst: 2nd
[1:46:55] Deathchampt: 10 weeks uk
[1:46:58] 無職提督: 2nd one

[1:47:02] Sollice: DNA*
[1:47:03] CMOBB: Take one and 28 days later for second.
[1:47:06] TheBeastofCaerBannog: i've heard 2nd one is worse
[1:47:10] Sollice: It depends on the shot but its normally 23-28 days
[1:47:17] MOLAR305: 3 weeks here in florida
[1:47:20] Sollice: No
[1:47:31] Slitze: don't know if it was the person giving it or the shot.. but definitely felt the 2nd pinch
[1:47:31] swordwindgaming: They have 5G in it
[1:47:38] NoMashMe: vaccine 420
