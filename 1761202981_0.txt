[0:20:49] EliBourne: its gonna affect PVP for sure\
[0:20:50] Galdrena: someone gifted me Diablo 4! can't wait!
[0:20:54] The_Mpower: what if they're changing it to make everyone to swtich to diablo
[0:21:00] Jayison78: paladin nerf too or no ?
[0:21:30] Galdrena: @vanillasky7788 because you were saying a bunch of stuff that people usually say when they are drinking lol
[0:22:46] Jayison78: m flower biz lol
[0:22:51] EliBourne: way too much CC in arenas
[0:23:06] Xaviwan078: big up for frost dk and ret paladin next patch very happy
[0:23:17] EliBourne: doesnt affect fury lol
[0:23:19] The_Mpower: im holy pala right now and i feel that i can't heal like it was in old wow, just 1 cc and you can't heal
[0:23:26] Rastafaris: dracthyr meta
[0:23:28] PapaBeks: I'm reserving my judgement, but i think i agree with the direction they are going. This isn't "the end all" this is testing imo. We always complain. We want changes, we get them, half of us hate them half love them, we all end up playing. it will be fine
[0:23:54] xidion32: Yeah until you get trained by 2 melees and you can't stun them long enough to stop them
[0:24:04] EliBourne: wouldnt it be simplier to buff healers ?
[0:24:34] PapaBeks: the R1's are a differnt breed, they aren't like us normies, it wont effect us normies like it does the R1's. if anything it might make the normies more competitve
[0:24:36] PapaBeks: watch
[0:24:37] Jayison78: needs find new games 😂
[0:24:40] PapaBeks: you heard it here first
[0:24:49] EliBourne: 10.1
[0:24:51] xidion32: 10.1
[0:24:54] The_Mpower: summer?
[0:24:56] EliBourne: april
[0:24:57] PapaBeks: 10.1
[0:25:11] EliBourne: no no no
[0:25:19] EliBourne: march 21st is 1.0.7
[0:25:22] xidion32: Disc priest went from a tier to s+++
[0:25:25] EliBourne: 10.0.7
[0:25:27] xidion32: S tier*
[0:25:33] Jayison78: It' s so badly
[0:25:37] The_Mpower: 10.07 is march 21
[0:25:42] EliBourne: these are for 10.1 that comes out in april
[0:26:47] PapaBeks: correct, that will effect the classes who depend on crit more obviously but it should slow down the burst and give healers a chance to save the day more often
[0:26:55] PapaBeks: which is fine, let's play the game
[0:27:02] PapaBeks: my guess is they get rid of Orc racial
[0:27:18] xidion32: I think these changes were directed at making solo shuffle more appealing for healers
[0:27:18] PapaBeks: all racials and gear that lowers durations on stuns ect are gonna go
[0:27:28] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:27:46] PapaBeks: they are going away on crafted gear
[0:27:56] PapaBeks: any crafted with those effects are gone
[0:28:17] PapaBeks: your 2 set for your conquest trinkets is gone too

However, it won't be like Diablo 2 where the entire world was open PvP, instead it will be an optional experience that takes place in special PvP zones, called Fields of Hatred."

[0:42:25] CptShooter: Why waste time on pvp in a game that isn't for it. Diablo should only be for mindless demon killing and chillout. If they get this part right, then they can move on to the hard part like pvp. Lost Ark did it almost right.

[2:04:40] JonnyScotland: You have to pay for that rested guide addon don't you?

[2:14:44] killswitch1508: Hey @swifty  we love you since 2009.
[2:14:46] SpidercowSD: @swifty watched some videos on the changes. Is it really a change? They just moved the trinket effect to all skills?

[2:14:53] hydewayne: Dead soon
[2:14:56] TrippThree: Gutted Rogue

[2:17:22] folly1: Woohoo this is great news cc drives me nuts
[2:17:31] Djinx_o: I'm gonna miss being CC'd by a rogue a whole game
[2:17:50] blastboys123: its more meaningful because u cant just spam it?
[2:18:10] TravisThee: When I saw the changes as a resto druid main I was like "YESSS I GET TO PLAY THE GAME!"
[2:18:22] folly1: I was taken out of a solo shuffle cuz they cc’d me all the time
[2:18:32] TheEndIsNear777: it's more meaningful because you'd have to choose when to use the CC instead of just using it on Cooldown i guess like rogue strat of kidney every 20 seconds
[2:18:32] skindredz: everone exept Venruki is overreacting I feel
[2:18:48] moonglazzer: thats why so many rogues in classic now
[2:18:53] blastboys123: blind into sapping out of combat is busted

[2:19:34] brayley16: I am an RBG'er and it changes the way we assualt bases with rogues
[2:19:36] PaEu: gotta see how it feels before you can call it bad i guess
[2:19:36] kelorik_: rip wow pvp final nail in the coffin
[2:19:46] folly1: This dude is whack cc is huge in the game
[2:19:46] PaEu: anyways retail pvp hasnt been good since cata imo
[2:19:51] stephens0197: -3 sec??? That means storm bolt only going to last 3 sec???
[2:19:55] hydewayne: How is it great
[2:20:03] brayley16: so now the only way a rogue can steal bases if they get trinket for some reason if they arent smart and a boomy clones off of a blind
[2:20:05] stephens0197: 1 sec*
[2:20:06] Seanio7: If the cc was already not that strong what was their reason for reducing it further?
[2:20:10] Kazanta: Why is he complaining about cc being less meaningful when he also says it’s not used at the moment
[2:20:11] Djinx_o: Maybe more will play healer now, so shorter solo ques hopefully ^^
[2:20:28] kelorik_: now we got cross faction guilds and dungeon, the whole ally vs horde doesnt even exist anymore
[2:20:28] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:20:34] TheEndIsNear777: to deal with 2 melee's training you hard they need to bring back casting while moving
[2:20:41] TheEndIsNear777: while still having cc
[2:20:47] TheEndIsNear777: and being cc'd
[2:20:55] TheSimplyChris: Last night I got 3 solo shuffles in a row with no healer and 2 prot paladins
[2:21:02] Xulinder: I have a Hpala Rdruid & DPriest all geared for arenas and its so tough
[2:21:03] blastboys123: the whle ally vs horde thing has been redudant considering they team up every expansion anyways
[2:21:07] Djinx_o: <3 <3
[2:21:09] TrippThree: Pikaboo does say that in the video.. These changes might be letting more hearts come back.
[2:21:17] TrippThree: Healers*
[2:21:19] fragge1337: rip frost DK lol
[2:21:28] stephens0197: Spending 20-30 mins in que an average is insane, so let's hope
[2:21:31] hydewayne: No everyone will play healer because of that
[2:21:33] TheEndIsNear777: i main frost dk BibleThump
[2:21:47] t00thnnailzgaming: the reduction to cc is max 3 sec. most are 2 second reductions. lol they only nerfed 1 warrior stun, they forgot we have more than 1
[2:21:52] stone162: These guys are specifically talking arena. These changes help battlegrounds immensely
[2:22:08] Humicrobe: these guys are crying for nothing
[2:22:15] stephens0197: @t00thnnailzgaming which warrior stun?
[2:22:16] Humicrobe: they make no sense
[2:22:36] TheSimplyChris: What I don't like is sitting and watching my character for most of the match instead of playing it
[2:22:37] TrippThree: You can’t with these changes
[2:22:39] Humicrobe: 25% less crit dmg
[2:22:40] TravisThee: They're acting like CC is gone lol
[2:22:43] stephens0197: I feel like all warrior stuns are so short as is
[2:22:43] TrippThree: Or Warr Pally
[2:22:44] Humicrobe: and no 15% trinket
[2:22:47] Humicrobe: reduct
[2:22:51] Kazanta: Power Word barrier Kappa
[2:23:00] TrippThree: Warr pally and warr Dk will run the game
[2:23:00] TravisThee: like ffs it's a fraction of a second
[2:23:01] TheEndIsNear777: heal while moving/casting while moving so they can heal and run from enemy
[2:23:02] Poffiin: !followage
[2:23:11] Humicrobe: the cc durations are the same without 15% cc reduction
[2:23:17] brayley16: he is only complainging cause he is a rogue main and he cant blind sap out of combat
[2:23:19] Djinx_o: Warrior DKs stun, spear and  CC are reduced too?
[2:23:19] Humicrobe: these guys arguments make 0 sense
[2:23:20] neugassh: its not flat x sec nerfs because they removed the cc reduction as well
[2:23:22] brayley16: THATS THE ONLY REASON
[2:23:23] t00thnnailzgaming: stormbolt stun went from 4 sec to 3 second stun
[2:23:24] TravisThee: They even said the blind sap is a test.
[2:23:27] Kaldriik: going for glad retail this season ? <3
[2:23:35] Kaldriik: be fun content
[2:23:35] DigitalAnthrax: idk id take the input from a multi rank 1 then randoms lol
[2:23:38] TrippThree: Hahahaha why be a rogue when you can be a warrior!!!!
[2:23:43] folly1: I’m still gonna play rogue
[2:23:55] brayley16: YES
[2:23:58] t00thnnailzgaming: warriors have shockwave, shield charge, heroic leap and storm bolt
[2:24:00] Humicrobe: the complaints dont make sense
[2:24:06] brayley16: rmp is the biggest nerf
[2:24:09] Humicrobe: precog is built in now for casted cc its a buff
[2:24:13] TrippThree: Yes
[2:24:14] TrippThree: Blond
[2:24:15] JonnyScotland: imagine a rogue complaining, after all the years of BS
[2:24:16] PaEu: lets be real, this is world of warcraft. rogue is still gonna be OP
[2:24:19] TrippThree: Blind by 3 sec
[2:24:34] Humicrobe: 'sooo much shorter'
[2:24:38] Humicrobe: omg
[2:24:39] Humicrobe: divas
[2:24:40] brayley16: the only reason i would complain about the cc nerfs is cause i do RBG's mostly and now rogues cant solo take a base unless they literally just kill the base sitter
[2:24:46] Humicrobe: its 6 sec
[2:24:46] Gish3: Oh no, I can't get chained CC'd anymore? Anyways.
[2:24:51] Humicrobe: 2 secs off
[2:24:53] blastboys123: its still an interuppt
[2:24:57] Seanio7: Im sorry but thats just silly xD
[2:24:59] brayley16: or take a boomy with them to a base
[2:24:59] Humicrobe: poly is 6 sec
[2:25:02] TrippThree: It got cut down by 3 sec
[2:25:13] Humicrobe: they are so salty its crazy
[2:25:22] TrippThree: Poly got taken down by 2sec
[2:25:26] Humicrobe: no more 15% cc reduct
[2:25:42] Humicrobe: the game is being balanced baseline now which is good
[2:25:52] Humicrobe: 'cc doesnt feel meaningfull'
[2:25:56] JimPusher: who is they?
[2:25:59] Humicrobe: is he smoking lmao
[2:26:11] brayley16: KEEP THE CURRENT CC AND GIVE ME 30 SECOND TRINKET
[2:26:16] brayley16: XD
[2:26:22] Humicrobe: its better for healers that why?
[2:26:25] Humicrobe: cdew heals
[2:26:27] TheSimplyChris: NO ONE was saying that! Everyone was saying how bad CC was. Look at the forums for 3 seconds and you could see people complain about how much CC was in the game

[2:33:44] Toga_troubles: I like the idea of shortening the CCs
[2:33:46] TrippThree: Listen a little bit more, he talks about the influx of healers probably!

[2:35:27] Verkithos: I think it will be a good change. It should give healers some breathing room to actually heal instead of being CCed for days.
