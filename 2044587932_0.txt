[1:01:14] Mungtime: false allegations are fucking gross
[1:01:15] basedlamarck: @turkturkelton it is allegedly, he was found civilly liable, which is just preponderance of the evidence, not criminally liable, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. even if he was found criminally liable, you can still think the jury got the decision wrong

[3:43:52] boopbopbamski: 123
[3:43:52] Korben_dallas5: Warlock is ADHD repellent
[3:43:54] numblezzz: i wonder how the average warlock would do on a basic algebra exam
[3:43:57] 冂凵乃口: then spriest is the hardest because you press buttons and do 0 damage KEKL
[3:44:07] Lunights: @冂凵乃口 Sadge
[3:44:10] re5onxnce: basically tesla if you play lock
[3:44:32] moneyfornothing69: why is he so fat? i thought cali had good healthcare

[3:44:43] tylive52: yup i did and i am
[3:44:45] Playermodd: sod phase 1 took too long
[3:44:49] MyOpiate: so many retail andys
[3:44:55] cjadude: yeaahrs
[3:44:59] EverstillTV: Even bran new players to WoW joined SoD
[3:45:30] numblezzz: if sod adds arena, im never going back to retail
[3:45:34] boopbopbamski: yes
[3:45:35] wookinit: yea
[3:45:36] flawless_jv: i think so
[3:45:36] nesbb: yes
[3:45:37] iknowido: blizzard tricked everyone again lol

[3:45:39] bone555: KEKW KEKW
[3:45:44] anoobistuu11: hell no
[3:45:45] boopbopbamski: this is pretty much the pre patch for the real game P2 gonna be BIG
[3:45:47] Spanos_: less alts at 40
[3:45:48] wookinit: p2 sod made kargoz come back
[3:45:49] wookieenthal: bots sure do love sod
[3:45:51] Playermodd: people have like 10 alts in sod
[3:46:04] OrganikCum: i think this is the calm before the storm, p2 is going to be insanely good
[3:46:10] iknowido: so many had doubts
[3:46:14] graduenz: same 1000 players creating alts
[3:46:24] memil141: shhow osss dog bro!!!!
[3:46:24] Playermodd: sod hc sure lasted a long time lol
[3:46:38] memil141: we want dog king
[3:46:40] boopbopbamski: yes

[3:46:50] memil141: yes
[3:46:51] luzid7: hell nah
[3:46:53] captcrane: yes
[3:46:53] biki2112: not after this
[3:46:53] boopbopbamski: give it a few years but I want it
[3:46:54] memil141: yeee
[3:46:58] Playermodd: nah classic is jover
[3:46:58] iknowido: claasic crowd seems more sensitive
[3:46:58] Piorum_: vanilla, no changes, buuuuut wow token hopefully
[3:47:00] numblezzz: the problem with dragonflight is over saturation of rewards. there is no rpg progression that feels good, just empty goals with shitty transmog and toy rewards
[3:47:01] Lionkingler1: early next year
[3:47:03] Harles_: absolutely not
[3:47:03] HrdScp: pre pandaria classic
[3:47:06] luzid7: then they should do a better sod till its not seasonal
[3:47:07] EverstillTV: After cata
[3:47:09] MyOpiate: classic + classic hc fresh
[3:47:12] tendollafatha: they should do discovery no level caps
[3:47:12] DibsieRS: classic fresh servers added to era
[3:47:15] memil141: show os dog!
[3:47:17] bone555: Peggers Peggers
[3:47:18] memil141: waaaa!
[3:47:21] iknowido: can we finally get a gdkp server
[3:47:22] sirdreadeye: sstvDog <3 <3
[3:47:23] huisaatana: its gonna be sod tbc next tbh
[3:47:23] LastHour: what a princess
[3:47:26] MarcoFlee: finish sod, classic fresh, then spend that time developing classic+ content. rinse and repeat
[3:47:31] memil141: beuti!
[3:47:52] Playermodd: sod is a good idea, but phase 2 sould have started like last week
[3:48:00] zenity360: sod 100 percent killed off wrath, people love easy content.
[3:48:08] craboskai: people don't want cata KEKL
[3:48:09] N_Tys: ICC is fun
[3:48:10] LastHour: am I a dud for still playing wrath and raid logging? haha
[3:48:11] Piorum_: yes
[3:48:13] memil141: yeeeeeee
[3:48:14] scyllynn: no
[3:48:15] Maruika: yeah i think they should have
[3:48:16] plumpus81: of course
[3:48:16] swaee: no it would be too easy
[3:48:17] Mawshaw: No
[3:48:20] iknowido: yeah because people are so bad
[3:48:22] OptimusBanana420: no
[3:48:22] biki2112: it wouldnt matter
[3:48:23] Playermodd: wqotlk isnt classic
[3:48:24] memil141: yye
[3:48:27] Spanos_: just Heroic LK was annoying
[3:48:27] cloudstrife543: yes
[3:48:30] iknowido: lots still havent cleared heroic
[3:48:33] CatformTV: they should have added ruby  sanctum with icc
[3:48:33] memil141: fucck yeha
[3:48:34] numblezzz: definitely not. adding the challenge extended icc popularity if anything
[3:48:36] hart_mk1: i never got to play wrath as a teen so i'm kind of sad it's falling off
[3:48:37] Bronloch: ITS THE ECONOMY STUPID
[3:48:37] chatgpttwitchbot: @StaysafeTV  No i had fun progressing it and my guild finally killed it last night
[3:48:38] cloudstrife543: i didint plya tbc or wotlk
[3:48:49] kaiju_kin: I remember when it dropped you said it would pop for 10 years
[3:48:53] Tomoglaziat: pvp is going strong
[3:48:56] LastHour: I kinda like it but maybe its because of my guildies
[3:49:00] Piorum_: people don't clear the bosses, they feel behind or get burnt out on prog, they quit. People who want challenging encounters are playing retail
[3:49:05] graduenz: 50% of that chart is jokerd atls
[3:49:07] memil141: i like pvp
[3:49:10] Nightbot: NEW SOD VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPVzazEyxw
[3:49:11] iknowido: lots of one shot mechanics like retail mythic raiding lol
[3:49:21] Playermodd: people now understand classic is the best version of wow
[3:49:30] kaiju_kin: jeesh
[3:49:34] LastHour: always was!
[3:49:39] smurfberriess: i really enjoy your videos on YouTube @staysafetv
[3:49:40] luzid7: the leveling buff is stupid
[3:49:42] memil141: 30!
[3:49:48] Maruika: not many play classic to prog a few bosses for 100 attempts
[3:49:50] memil141: true!!!!
[3:49:56] boopbopbamski: -WOTLK +sod phase 2 PREP
[3:50:02] dontbecold: Targeted ad Pog
[3:50:11] MyOpiate: everyone has WoW fatigue
[3:50:24] Maruika: wotlk peak to valley is wild
[3:50:28] MonzonWasTaken: how tf was launch so low
[3:50:36] crumbler81: Cata will save wow!
[3:50:40] Dakix: whos video is this?
[3:50:40] CatformTV: @adarislive cause no one raided?
[3:50:43] LastHour: quiet you devil woman
[3:50:43] daveisdavis: @StaysafeTV  is cassic fina dead
[3:50:46] MonzonWasTaken: ahhh hehe
[3:50:57] MonzonWasTaken: noobs
[3:51:07] Genghjs: Hard n long
[3:51:23] Playermodd: what if private servers were the answer all along
[3:51:26] InDecline: many playerz dont care about cata so why push wotlk icc
[3:51:37] daveisdavis: oopiipppppppppppipippopoooooooooooooooooki,oooooooooooooikoip9890k888;i8k.po,,k ,,p;pppkoooooooo.ip
[3:51:38] Thoreya: classic mop will be
[3:51:39] Thoreya: idk bout cata
[3:51:41] kaiju_kin: it will mostly flop
[3:51:42] Playermodd: cata isnt classic and its doa
[3:51:44] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Who asked for Classic Cata KEKL
[3:51:44] Thoreya: @daveisdavis huh
[3:51:45] numblezzz: classic cata will be successful but just less than wotlk
[3:51:49] memil141: i love cata
[3:51:50] Maruika: cata raids are harder, its going to kill it big time
[3:51:50] bigdiesel900: cata is DOA
[3:51:50] Dethkar_tv: fuck cata classic
[3:51:53] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @daveisdavis true
[3:51:54] Dethkar_tv: unless i wanna pvp
[3:51:54] HrdScp: I think cata is too new for classic players and too old for retail players
[3:51:55] Wingsofjanitor: we used to think WOTLK era was a given but I don't believe that anymore either
[3:51:56] Thoreya: i think theyre doing cata for MOP
[3:51:58] numblezzz: you also said sod was gonna be a flop
[3:51:59] Thoreya: imo
[3:52:03] Fullheala: cata is shit
[3:52:05] Phorty__: I have 0 intention on even trying cata classic
[3:52:06] CriticalSwede: I would prefer if they started all over again
[3:52:10] Thoreya: bc MOP will be a banger
[3:52:12] pipxsqueak: wow ended after icc
[3:52:12] N_Tys: whats a failure though? I think it'll have more than classic era numbers
[3:52:14] CatformTV: wow HC will save wow
[3:52:14] coeursiy: classic WoD Pog
[3:52:17] luzid7: i don't know many people that wanna play it but they all say they just play it a little bit
[3:52:19] phiAnthony91: im still on pagle its dead dead
[3:52:20] Pwinzor: cata raids got way more difficult and gdkp's aren't gonna be happening at the same rate as wrath
[3:52:21] LastHour: cata will flop, there will be a spike during launch as usual but once leveling is done it will drop like no other
[3:52:22] wookieenthal: FirstTimeChadder
[3:52:25] swaee: yyes
[3:52:31] Valencia_Pete: i don't think i'll even entertain the idea of playing cata
[3:52:36] swaee: 3 times week
[3:52:39] Maruika: p1 cata is bis
[3:52:50] Playermodd: the future of classic is provate servers
[3:52:52] iknowido: how many bosses in ruby ? 2?
[3:52:53] Phorty__: classic +
[3:52:56] boopbopbamski: SOD is the PTR for classic+
[3:53:00] cognacbear: its mop
[3:53:03] boopbopbamski: its all just testing for the future
[3:53:05] Doctakay: SOD will end with classic+
[3:53:06] Piorum_: We need to go back to Naxx (25 man)
[3:53:10] iknowido: people will play it all
[3:53:11] LastHour: @iknowido just one
[3:53:20] hersh__69: @boopbopbamski COPIUM
[3:53:25] madgarlicjr: HYPERCATJAM HYPERCLAP
[3:53:30] bone555: KEKW KEKW
[3:53:31] CatformTV: hope not
[3:53:32] boopbopbamski: they could just keep making new seasons trying new things keep the good remove the bad each season
[3:53:34] numblezzz: i think having several versions of wow that overtake eachother every couple months is good
[3:53:34] MrWafer29: i know
[3:53:34] thabryman: def wont turn out like retail :)
[3:53:34] luzid7: yeah i don't know why its seasonal but we will see
[3:53:39] kittenm1ttens: NODDERS
[3:53:39] willgohs1234: Whats the best 1vs1 class atm ?
[3:53:40] biki2112: its a seasonal server tho
[3:53:42] MonzonWasTaken: tbc sod
[3:53:43] longsfellow1200: that would be sick
[3:53:45] hart_mk1: i like the idea of going the same route as jagex did with OSRS
[3:53:45] Mertauh: I want tbc systems and raids with vanilla world
[3:53:47] truffle_shuffler: I stiped playing at the end of retail wrath before cata prepatch. im looking forward to playing it this time around.
[3:53:47] DuoX: burning crusade sod , can't wait
[3:53:52] MonzonWasTaken: TBC POGGERS
[3:53:53] madgarlicjr: let me transfer my era character Prayge
[3:53:55] Valencia_Pete: i want ssf hc vanilla and classic plus and they'll have my sub forever
[3:53:56] Doctakay: They said the characters will go to a classic era server thats just as cool
[3:54:00] Mauraderss: hey bruther, did I miss news recap?
[3:54:01] daughtylock: Warlock rogue hybrid would be INSANE!
[3:54:17] Playermodd: sod is the reason why microsoft didnt fire the whole wow team
[3:54:28] numblezzz: sod will spike, cata will spike, sod will spike, war within wille spike, etc etc. we are getting lots of shit
[3:54:32] kingdulli: when worgen
[3:54:40] numblezzz: play what you like, just be happy we arent getting 13 month droughts
[3:54:42] kingdulli: bring in new races for sod
[3:54:43] LastHour: transmog and token makes it bad
[3:54:47] kaiju_kin: @Playermodd maybe not whole but that is actually funny to think about
[3:54:58] StaysafeTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2_De-McyzU 󠀀
[3:55:06] MarcoFlee: I hope that recruit some of the world designers from retail and develop some of their own in classic. one of the things retail really nails
[3:55:35] bone555: zzz
[3:55:40] StaysafeTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2_De-McyzU
[3:55:40] totezmcgoatz_: imagine someone playing nostalrius hearing about the current state of vanilla wow
[3:55:40] StaysafeTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2_De-McyzU 󠀀
[3:56:06] MonzonWasTaken: copy paste
[3:56:14] numblezzz: if using old art style, not very hard
[3:56:16] heylowdub: lol
[3:56:16] nesbb: copy paste gm island ez clap
[3:56:21] Pwinzor: zone design takes way less time then other aspects of the game especially with modern tools and hardware
[3:56:22] CayneOTS: about a week max
[3:56:25] iknowido: 3 days
[3:56:25] HrdScp: putting content on there is the hard part
[3:56:26] craboskai: not hard at all KEKL
[3:56:27] Tossel: Hi @StaysafeTV how are you buddy
[3:56:29] schizoKino: procedural generation hardcore WoW Pog
[3:56:30] heylowdub: if only it were that easy
[3:56:33] TyrDraco: give us Dalaran 2.0
[3:56:36] cloudstrife543: ez
[3:56:42] Synmachus: Very easy for an actual game dev. The Classic team don't have that
[3:56:43] Piorum_: its the wc3 engine terrain
[3:56:46] asleepnotwoke: it would need to be on its own client
[3:56:47] CygnusC: there's private servers that have all of that
[3:56:50] asleepnotwoke: not the classic client
[3:56:50] Mertauh: gotta make the evasion spots YEP
[3:56:52] iMattbat: the palworld devs could do it
[3:56:52] numblezzz: there vanilla model terraining is pretty simple. you can see youtube videos of people using it
[3:56:55] MarcoFlee: to just make something? really easy. but it's pretty hard to make something memorable
[3:56:58] schizoKino: you select a tool and thats it pretty much
[3:57:02] LastHour: the world would be the easier part, I feel like the actual content would be the harder part
[3:57:04] HuskerFball: turtle wow can do it quick im sure they can do it so much faster
[3:57:06] schizoKino: like a brush in photsohop
[3:57:13] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Epoch > Turtle
[3:57:15] Playermodd: priavte servers are the future
[3:57:18] CayneOTS: people use to do it on private servers thats how easy it is
[3:57:21] craboskai: 🐢
[3:57:29] ohioliving: turtle wow is the classic + server
[3:57:39] wookieenthal: time is money friend
[3:57:46] lightkekerino: turtle wow is the wokest pos server you will play
[3:57:52] luzid7: and they are making new dungeons /raids and don't substitute them
[3:57:56] numblezzz: i think the sod devs will copy turtle wow model. just give em time
[3:57:58] XarcTV: i dont like playing on 400+ ping tho
[3:58:11] garbobean: theres a new dungeon too i think
[3:58:13] kaiju_kin: new zones at 60 in sod?
[3:58:13] craboskai: its not hard, blizzard just does nothing KEKL
[3:58:18] MarcoFlee: are the zones any good though? it's pretty easy to just spin up new zones by pasting pre-existing models in random places
[3:58:18] Playermodd: why doesnt blizzard host private servers and charge a fee;
[3:58:19] StaysafeTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2_De-McyzU
[3:58:20] Plathyy: food on counter

[3:58:37] numblezzz: @Playermodd ive been saying this a long time. garry's mod style server hosting
[3:58:47] shungilungi: did u hear the ben shapiro rap
[3:58:47] Plathyy: hope spices are ok, i cant taste or smell anything
[3:59:15] Playermodd: @Playermodd yeah it doesnt make sense why they dont and allow devs to make cool stuff off their ip and charge a fee for hosting

[5:04:15] TurboBased: true
[5:04:16] Rasc237: i'm an alcoholic stoner too but i wouldn't have kids because something bad would happen to them because i'm dumb
[5:04:16] Mauraderss: @staysafetv what did Michael do to merit such allegations from the media?
[5:04:22] AceOfFlame: Michael Jackson was basically abused as a child that was never able to leave his childhood
[5:04:32] numblezzz: michael jackson got medically castrated by his father to make him a "castrati" singer
[5:04:36] TurboBased: this is why it was so easy for them to sell the lie
[5:04:37] Cryptonian_Knight: true
[5:04:40] TheMrBoston: if he didnt make thriller, there would be no polarized argument for the population to make
[5:04:44] terlet_terwilliger: Michael Jackson was so rich at one point in time he could have no friends because everyone was trying to steal from him, so he spent a lot of time with kids
[5:04:44] TheMrBoston: he would just be michael the pedophile lol
[5:04:46] AceOfFlame: being a celebrity fucked his entire mental growth with his life
[5:04:49] Rasc237: 2nd is true

[5:05:22] hart_mk1: @TheMrBoston ur a retard
[5:05:28] Bronloch: disagree valid question
[5:05:29] JustinOne: he turned white so his dad would not beat the shit out of him ..
[5:05:33] mrwasdead: it's like saying you should smoke cigarettes because you haven't seen someone die from them

[5:06:27] Metaphix: what about inviting their friends to your house
[5:06:28] Veldigodt: thats WEIRD
[5:06:32] TheMrBoston: The point i am making is that people argue he was not a pedophile; there would be no argument in his defense if he was not famous
[5:06:32] Veldigodt: you dont trust your kids then
[5:06:33] hart_mk1: oh you don't think trump is gay? so you'd kiss him?
[5:06:35] DankWizard420: arent they already homeschooled? KEKW
[5:06:35] purpledrank210: same here, wife and I said NOPE
[5:06:40] hcdini: you seriously dont know who you are sending your children to
[5:06:41] EffinsTV: @StaysafeTV It seems that his father may have put him through a process of chemical castration or something along those lines while he was a kid, so he can keep his voice, high pitch tone.
[5:06:41] PabloTheFlapmaster: my parents also didnt let me do that when i was a kid and i didnt understand it at the time
[5:06:45] numblezzz: my best friends are kids i met in elementary school - they slept over at my place 100 times, came to our beach house

[5:20:53] Genghjs: Socially stunted in the modern world is a good thing
[5:20:53] Mertauh: It is possible to socially stunt your kids through homeschooling but just like the school itself all you have to do is choose to socialize them

[5:21:18] Mauraderss: they also come from higher income families..

[5:22:09] Arcsilin: legit FUCK TAHT
[5:22:16] Vehicle_King: The overall contributing factor(s) is parental involvement and teacher to student ration.

[5:22:27] fanofthebengals: there are some schools near me that focus more on trade skills in highschool which i find awesome
[5:22:27] anfractuous17: they'll be a product of their parents so if the parents to a larger degree so if the parents are fucked they will be too

[5:23:02] kingpincognito: My Mother homeschooled my 3 kids and they had social groups of like 30 other homeschool kids they did stuff with 3 days a week.
[5:23:14] Link9286: what if they get bullied at homeschool
[5:23:16] hart_mk1: the "weird' homeschooled kid probably had weird parents... normal parents probably would produce a normal homeschooled kid
[5:23:17] TurboBased: Pepega you cant have meetups with other kids outside of school
[5:23:19] madgarlicjr: space camp
[5:23:20] cyonara74: wow friends
[5:23:21] daddical: most home schooling programs heavily promote social gatherings of all kinds for the students in the modern day. its on the parents to make sure they give their kids the opportunities to socialize.
[5:23:25] Doribob1: how will the kids learn to rizz the opposite sex?
[5:23:27] numblezzz: i played soccer with home schooled kids. they were autistic af

[5:23:37] OptimusBanana420: VIBE 󠀀
[5:23:41] vectorsgames: so are the outcomes based on family circumstance or the actual home schooling, the real question

[5:24:02] dazantaz: give us your best moonwalk matt
[5:24:05] Mawshaw: @StaysafeTV I think people have just perpetuated the "homeschool kid weird" trope from movies and TV shows so far that they think it's a fact at this point
[5:24:06] CrixVibez: @hart_mk1 Nah. Peer pressure and the such comes from schooling
[5:24:10] donkeebrainz: who doesnt care about us
[5:24:13] CrixVibez: IE friends from school

[5:25:36] beeyank: just joined what state are you moving to
[5:25:44] madgarlicjr: 100 per kid?
[5:25:50] Vehicle_King: @vectorsgames family, having direct access to a teacher that isnt overburdened with 30 other kids per class are the major reasons. homeschool or not. Those kids do better.
[5:25:53] Wingsofjanitor: bespoke, artisinal private schooling POG
[5:25:58] harvenius: that sounds a lot like a ... school

[5:26:02] Metaphix: it takes a village FeelsStrongMan
[5:26:04] Link9286: have you ever seen the move "The Village" - reminds me of people opting out of society and bulding their own
[5:26:07] weebpulper: we are considering this as well
[5:26:07] Ashrilexx: I'm being honest, whats the point of not just using school at that point? how can you trust random parents more than teachers?
[5:26:11] Lionkingler1: how do you make sure the other parents arent retards and actually teach your kids something?
[5:26:21] hart_mk1: what if the other parents are the "they/them" "theybies" parents? @StaysafeTV
[5:26:25] numblezzz: i think thats a decent alternative to public school
[5:26:26] BlueTheShaman: normies never interact with homeschool kids bc they just get Cs and go through public school doing 0 non school funded extra curriculars so they dont know whats out there
[5:26:27] wookieenthal: so its a sleepover minus the sleep
[5:26:29] Bronloch: Homeschooling is not even about the teacher is about all the other retarded criminial kids that never get expelled! LUL

[5:27:32] edvleespet: aren't you concerned about the education quality other parents can provide?
[5:27:37] mrwasdead: parents would actually pull their kid out of private school just to go to my high school
[5:27:38] Arcsilin: i know many kids the went to private school ost of them arnt fuck ups LOL
[5:27:39] fanofthebengals: @Dusta_Rhymes same

[5:28:30] beeyank: what state are you moving to
[5:28:34] iamharmor: everyone i know that did homeschool did not go to college
[5:28:37] yuckil: do u have a curriculum planned
[5:28:38] edvleespet: oh yeah for sure, good point
[5:28:39] Metaphix: 7th graders reading at 2nd grade level LULW
[5:28:40] yuckil: yet
[5:28:46] beeyank: oh i thought you were looking out of state
[5:28:51] madgarlicjr: all it takes is one shitty as student to take all of the teachers energy
[5:28:53] Mungtime: public education is a joke
[5:28:55] Dusta_Rhymes: more like WashingDUMB ha ha!
[5:29:03] LordOfDread: u ever go to levensworth
[5:29:04] Utmost777: That is awesome you found a coop in your area. My sister loves hers with her kids homeschool
[5:29:17] madgarlicjr: people are in denial ?
[5:29:20] fanofthebengals: exactly it's strange
[5:29:22] Arcsilin: people cant handle the truth
[5:29:23] anoobistuu11: All the kids I knew who were homeschooled are Peepee poopoo heads now.
[5:29:23] Vehicle_King: I cant believe underfunded schools, underpaid and overworked teachers cant provide 1-on-1 time to teach each child. shocking
[5:29:25] Krtex: Typicall public school brainwash. forsenKek
[5:29:28] jaynkumz: I wish i went to private school and had rich parents that could buy my scores and wait for my trust fund
[5:29:28] hart_mk1: "no! ur kids should be dumb like me and our kids!"
[5:29:31] BlueTheShaman: tribalism. they went to public school and turned out "fine" so thats the way
[5:29:33] Metaphix: @LordOfDread the military prison?
[5:29:34] Bronloch: @Empiricol RIGHT like who would put such a grating annoying sound in their song over n over n over LUL
[5:29:43] BadGrahmmer: Public stigma operation against homeschool for the interest of the state for the last 40 years.
[5:29:45] LordOfDread: i mean how many ppl in the country go to public school vs home school
[5:29:47] Greedygoose: @jaynkumz what private school do you buy your scores at? rofl...
[5:29:48] CaptainWylde: No offense but a dude who has player an abnormal amount of video games for 17 years or so, cant really be a source of legitimacy in terms of social interaction. And on the issue of homeschooling that is such an absolute tiny sample size that the percentages are going to be completely convoluted. People that have the option to homeschool are people that have an economical advantage, most people dont have the income or resources to be stay at home parents/teachers
[5:29:50] lightkekerino: they are indoctrinated by the system
[5:29:51] TurboBased: or theyre not even parents
[5:29:55] kingpincognito: Nah! They take it personal because they went to public school and think you're calling them dumb.
[5:30:06] Dusta_Rhymes: nice essay @CaptainWylde
[5:30:09] Lionkingler1: average teacher is a better teacher than your average parent
[5:30:14] madgarlicjr: lol
[5:30:17] The_OG_Sushi: Question coming from an Australian! What do you think the most important thing a child should be taught at school?
[5:30:19] Doribob1: i dont understand arguing with another parent on what they choose to do with their child
[5:30:20] harvenius: frankly i 100% agree with parents being more invovled with their childrens education. Your children fail or succeed as a team
[5:30:24] madgarlicjr: invest in tts
[5:30:34] CaptainWylde: @dusta_rhymes i typed something sorry

[5:31:44] CaptainWylde: People dont have these resources dude
[5:31:45] Varanite: can't affluent parents make sure their children are in above average schools though?
[5:31:45] TurboBased: I also think most people dont realize how much better homeschooling has gotten. Its huge now
[5:31:45] donkeebrainz: we're in for a rough few decades
[5:31:50] numblezzz: home schooling is obviously superior education, the crux is just the social thing. we covered that tho
[5:31:59] CaptainWylde: Your acting like its black and white
[5:32:00] Humansoup: Oh Lord
[5:32:01] madgarlicjr: to many woman trying to get a free ride by having kids and then expect society to raise them.

[5:32:15] iamharmor: YOU WERE THINKING IT!
[5:32:15] Plathyy: what
[5:32:15] cyonara74: dont have children if you cant properly care for them
[5:32:16] Pimplejewce: i wonder if there is any information on co-parenting vs single unit parenting
[5:32:17] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I think you said that so you probably said that Madge
[5:32:18] Krtex: Thats a ban LUL
[5:32:19] TurboBased: HUH
[5:32:19] iamharmor: kidding
[5:32:19] Lionkingler1: @Greedygoose no idea how bad teach in the US are. Over here they all have master degrees in their field. So most certainly no single parent knows more than all those teacher combined
[5:32:21] donkeebrainz: chat is so retarded tonight
[5:32:21] Humansoup: lil p ?
[5:32:22] donkeebrainz: KEKW
[5:32:22] spike82q: that cause the government  incentivizes  the women to leave the man and  live on assistance,  if the government did not incentivite it, their would be alot less 1 parent house hold in AMerica
[5:32:27] Mungtime: I think people are really upset they arent afforded the same privileges in life
[5:32:33] Mungtime: get over it

[5:32:36] Doribob1: someone missed out they day they were giving out listening skill
[5:32:40] edvleespet: wasn't ment as pushback, i agree on the home schooling compared to public education. i was just questioning the education quality of other parents compared to your own.
[5:32:41] kingpincognito: Poor people are always going to be less educated. Fact of life.
[5:32:42] LordOfDread: the stats are probably pretty skewed
[5:32:44] hart_mk1: @StaysafeTV check his messages, he wrote an essay
[5:32:53] Vehicle_King: US needs to invest more in teachers. Theres a reason so many are leaving and taking other jobs
[5:32:55] GunTheRedneck: Chatters are retarded, you dont even need to be affluent to homeschool, im FAR from that and i am
[5:33:02] Greedygoose: @Lionkingler1 i got most of my education outside of the us. if you are making ur comment from outside of the us then it's irrelevant to the conversation
[5:33:10] mcbutttz: based on my life experience I could make a documentary on homeschooling and it'd have its negatives but in the end it worked. my parents are amazing
[5:33:13] Doribob1: how are you today @StaysafeTV

[5:34:43] anoobistuu11: You might get a better education homeschooled but the dumb public school kids will still give you wedgies and swirlies.
[5:34:45] Plathyy: @Dusta_Rhymes hey, doing great peepoHappy
[5:34:47] Pimplejewce: seems to me there is no way a teacher can actually do a good job unless they have the ability to seriously discipline the children. imagine being stunlocked by a single poorly behaved child. Fuck that job
[5:34:50] Mungtime: its common knowledge public education fucking sucks
[5:34:54] Greedygoose: @Lionkingler1 u can doubt all you want. american education system is shit and has gotten even worse the las 20 yrs
[5:34:56] calybroon: I dont doubt what u say, though the sample size for home schooled vs common schooled will be terribly unbalanced
[5:35:04] AceOfFlame: They can get bullied very easily as well that can greatly affect their education and wanting to learn as well
[5:35:12] 14forever: just graduated public highschool can confirm theres a bunch of weird fucks in the public school system that will totally change the course of you as a person.
[5:35:12] Varanite: what if you adjust outcomes for affluence?  you already said earlier that homeschooled kids come from more affluent families on average
[5:35:13] Bronloch: its a talking point of the left to shame religious schools that has been carried over to fear monger home schooling so public schools dont lose funding or vouchers get approved. @StaysafeTV
