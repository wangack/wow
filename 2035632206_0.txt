[0:59:45] Willco93: Hey Dorki, my M+ team and I have just started getting into 26-27 keys and the lack of a shot caller is bricking our keys. I'm the tank on vdh and am the most experienced player in the team. Any advice for reliably shot calling keys as a tank?
[0:59:47] Cruzerthebruzer: nerf boomkin or what
[0:59:50] marcofellipe69: not tiny brain called force of habit tink

[1:00:31] mk__9: OK
[1:00:32] zachl_: @Willco93 call ur sigils first and get a setup like dorkis to efficiently call kicks and stops with little brain power
[1:01:10] Celestial990: Yea steps to shotcalling is ideally be playing an easy spec or one you're comfy with, then make sure your UI is good for seeing kicks/stops

[1:03:48] burne114: wtf this boomy getting gapped by the tank and a healer???
[1:04:09] Willco93: I've been multiclassing tank for years but never had a team and now I do the burden of being the leader has kind of just fallen on me
[1:04:17] Celestial990: @Willco93 are you missing stuff because of brain overload or just b/c you didnt know you had to call a stop? depends on lot of stuff. its good to check vods of high keys to see how other groups are handling stops for pulls too
[1:04:20] marcofellipe69: GIGACHAD
[1:04:34] thelazyson: IAnyone have a link to the stops rotation WA?
[1:05:16] himynameispando: yooo
[1:05:35] Willco93: I think it's more if I'm getting rammed by a pack I tend to miss stuff cos I'm focusing more on me but then we just wipe cos nobody's hitting stops cos I didn't call
[1:05:41] mk__9: one more question about the cc weakaura and im out FailFish

[1:06:46] zachl_: @Willco93 the best thing as a vdh to start is be vocal about your sigils and thats a good starting point
[1:07:00] zachl_: you can build on more responsibility as you get more comfy with talking
[1:07:21] FrostmagicED: zach
[1:07:23] FrostmagicED: i did it
[1:07:34] Willco93: Yeah I definitely do that it's more just co-ordinating the other ppls stops. Thank you very much for the advice tho
[1:07:42] biglobez: when theres adds spawning like 2nd boss in BRH do you starfall? or cntnue to surge
[1:08:00] zachl_: @FrostmagicED MAJORW

[1:08:42] Willco93: I think I also need to push the zephyr/obsi scales/externals/personals onto the healer more cos I've been doing that too
[1:08:42] thelazyson: wilco can you drop the name of that WA for stops please
[1:08:43] K4lsdern: NonVerbal

[1:19:13] jenkinsdonuttv: My personal hot take: I think dungeons should be 6-man anyways, with a support, 3 dps, a tank. and a healer, with more support specs. Way too much balancing involved tho, so probably better to turn augvoker into wardvoker (tank)

[1:42:16] KaladinHS: which video
[1:42:18] K4lsdern: It is crazy Growl making the defense that Nerf saying ”Yo, don’t overlap my stuns“ and ”I hate playing with this healer“ or asking ”which global did you just press“ is not barking but JPC and Ellesmere saying ”You didn‘t call it“ is barking. Nerf called them out for their mistake, they called him out on his, and then he turned into a 5 year old with a tantrum. Nerf was the toxic one in this interaction not the rest of the people. Even if Nerf got tilted from being called out on being nonverbal

[1:46:30] BallenitaSploosh: at least we still got peat Gladge
[1:46:31] whiskeyhide: cause growl actually was talking about what its like having a team and not just being nonverbal LFG andys
[1:46:33] SL_Nerf_Herder: he tired to argue for the other side so people got mad
[1:46:40] Aandromega: Growl sticking up for the tanks so they invite him
[1:46:41] dadbod_007: Why do people not like Growl but like Tettles? blows my mind because Tettles is a blizz spy

Nerf called them out for their mistake, they called him out on his, and then he turned into a 5 year old with a tantrum. Nerf was the toxic one in this interaction not the rest of the people. Even if Nerf got tilted from being called out on being nonverbal

If Nerf was having such a tough time with the barking then he needs to be adult about it, either leave the team or share the growing frustration. Also, the fact that Growl feels he needs to come on and "explain" doesn't show loyalty, it shows this behavior is standard for this Nerf dude.
