[1:15:05] ScumBagIT: if i wanted to start playing wow in 2022 what version should i play
[1:15:30] ArukuGaming: @ScumBagIT What do you mean? Like retail or classic?
[1:15:34] sensenrogue: idk, for me its like red flag
[1:15:41] ScumBagIT: yeah
[1:15:45] NonExistanthuman: its a bit too late for classic TBC so you would have to level up for wotlk
[1:15:46] llockjaw: üçì
[1:15:56] NonExistanthuman: @sensenrogue 100%
[1:16:10] ArukuGaming: @ScumBagIT GL getting started in classic but retail everyone is getting ready for next expansion
[1:16:26] TY_Dunston: wow is super run right no
[1:16:28] jared70: why people pay so much its a over rated market @sensenrogue
[1:16:28] TY_Dunston: n

[1:18:13] ArukuGaming: @ScumBagIT What I would do
[1:18:22] sensenrogue: @jared70 I have no clue, it may be good from investment point, but it is insane how much people willing to pay for just a box to live in...
[1:18:42] ScumBagIT: is this classic or retail
[1:18:44] drmabusee: wait what the priest was dead or no?
[1:18:57] Galdrena: retail @ScumBagIT
[1:19:06] MonkikoBytes: @ScumBagIT If you've never played WoW, retail would be the way to go as Classic is more for people who want nostalgia.

[1:23:00] MonkikoBytes: @ScumBagIT I recommend leveling up your character yourself so you learn the class little by little especially if you are new or haven't played in a very long time
[1:23:10] MonkikoBytes: Retail doesn't take that long to level
[1:23:14] EliBourne: Thoughts on disarm on fury

[1:25:44] ArukuGaming: @ScumBagIT Well if mage is hard, DK wouldnt be much easier lol. Hunters are really good
[1:26:04] NonExistanthuman: swifty always wins
[1:26:21] KodiakJedi: Cant wait for the new UI and being able to save builds

[1:26:36] Dissuxx: What's the dark iron racial again?
[1:26:41] ScumBagIT: @ArukuGaming it might not be hard i just need to learn the rotations maybe. it like there are so many ways to play each role i still dont know what is best for me
[1:27:17] drtifuzko: yoooo my maaaan swifty
[1:27:36] ArukuGaming: @ScumBagIT As with all classes. Right now would be good to learn a class and be ready for next expansion. If youre fresh onto retail you might get enough time for some mythics
[1:28:33] ScumBagIT: @ArukuGaming what class would u suggest for someone that wants to do damage but isnt a glass cannon
[1:29:12] ArukuGaming: @ScumBagIT Hunter was a good choice. Otherwise, Shammy is also great

[2:34:24] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: @PLUGGlNG Yes it is, I have one of the highest ranked advisors in the USA the CPI has been manipulated its not how they use to report it back in the day inflation today is higher than ever.
[2:34:26] zulkarneynnnn: aldi is HILFE

[2:36:08] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: 20 years ago, your pops could work a normal job and buy a home. Today Pops and Grandma can both work and barely afford gas and food.
[2:36:09] PLUGGlNG: @Random_Uneducated_Viewer we are sitting at 8.6% yearly inflation, which is no where near as bad as it could be
[2:36:16] Capnrein: I couldnt compete with doordash and grubhub anymore
[2:36:24] PLUGGlNG: but that's what happens when you 2x balance sheets in 2 years
[2:36:24] SkydePvP: grubhub
[2:36:30] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: @PLUGGlNG No we are sitting way higher
[2:36:41] Fusienx: swifty for real I'm so intrigued. u were talking about the new exp and then said "we are soon getting" then u stopped :(
[2:36:44] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: ya thats the problem plugging doesnt understand CPI numbers
[2:36:52] KodiakJedi: Tampa had the highest inflation in the country last month...over 11%
[2:36:58] Roundonedog: @PLUGGlNG that is the worst inflation rate in 40 years.. what are you talking about?
[2:37:05] SheezyOG: 8.6? no chance
[2:37:07] JakesterSolo: Iv'e heard in Florida you dont pay taxes is that right?
[2:37:12] PLUGGlNG: @Random_Uneducated_Viewer so the fed is lying? gachiGASM
[2:37:13] Capnrein: the stock markets crashing
[2:37:19] LosDuervo: I've noticed a lot of the places where I am that had $0 delivery fee through uber eats recently switched to $4-$5 delivery fee.
[2:37:22] frontierxm: inflation- gas prices.
[2:37:27] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: @Roundonedog Correct that false CPI reading is the highest in 40 and its not accurate.
[2:37:47] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: they changed how they report CPI so that they can basically low ball it. They did this years ago real inflation is more than double 8 percent
[2:37:53] Capnrein: if you have a lot of money its probably a good time to buy crypto and stocks
[2:37:56] PLUGGlNG: @Roundonedog yeah it's the worst in 40 years... he said its the worst in history.. which is false
[2:38:08] cowsgoomooo: yes the Fed is lying if you look it up or talk to any economic professional they say inflation is realistically in double digits on inflation

[2:40:24] Capnrein: all the crypto tanked
[2:40:27] PLUGGlNG: @Random_Uneducated_Viewer obviously debt and spending is going to be at the worst ever... but you were stating INFLATION rates. and inflation rates are literally not at the 'worst ever'. fed balance sheets doubled in 2 years of course its bad
[2:40:40] PLUGGlNG: @Swifty bitcoin tanked from $70k to $20k
[2:40:42] PLUGGlNG: not 40k lol
[2:40:46] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: @PLUGGlNG What year had worse inflation.
[2:40:50] KodiakJedi: @CrazyS_1337 once you onlock Unity at Revered...it unlocks for all toons
[2:41:21] Roundonedog: If you buy BTC at $18k that is a generational opportunity for colossal GAINZ
[2:41:23] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: @PLUGGlNG My 93 year old great grandma lived thru the worst times. She even said never in history has the dollar been so inflated as it is now.
[2:41:28] cowsgoomooo: its the worst inflation recorded since 50s
[2:41:41] CrazyS_1337: @KodiakJedi does Revered comes after respectfull ?

[3:12:00] JakesterSolo: yea i feel you there, the classic community can be a lil elitist but im very excited for wrath to be honest ill no life it as much as pobbile
[3:12:04] JakesterSolo: possible*
[3:12:10] sheerheartattackyk: i will have to go healer instead for at least have an oportunity
[3:12:14] turaw_kemor: start with the cheap pvp gear from rep vendors

[3:13:06] Cerbzz: How do you queue alliance as a horde character?
[3:13:10] JakesterSolo: if you want bg wins that is
[3:13:14] galadriel77: prot warrior most fun pvp spec in wotlk indeed
[3:13:24] mauroxadi: horde has all the russians in EU and these dudes either suck or solo the BG
[3:13:28] seabass40: its by the orbis pvp vendor

[3:14:42] mauroxadi: @Swifty  has there ever been a period where you got bored of WoW and stopped playing?
[3:15:04] magictankz: Swiftly you are the main tank lol
[3:15:16] bigfurn: Hey Swifty, The battle test you use, Is that just the in game one or do you have an addon for it?
[3:15:23] sheerheartattackyk: btw im playing elemental, thats probably the issue
[3:15:25] delirious555: @mauroxadi Probably, that's when he does IRL. LUL
[3:15:25] pantherbagz: I want to see some Swifty & Mercader 2's
[3:16:14] yourstalker183: you have a sword or a mace for retri swifty?
[3:16:27] JakesterSolo: Athene returning to wow for classic wrath and teaming up with @Swifty  would be legendary
[3:16:39] kennymcorn: havent play for like 2-3 years is it worth to come back
[3:17:18] delirious555: Wotlk fresh servers is worth. Not sure about retail
[3:17:20] mauroxadi: lol
[3:17:49] yourstalker183: oh i see you have it transmog to a sword nice idea
[3:18:34] chimerablaque: yeah it would take a full month to catch up

[3:19:16] SoulboundxTV: thats just how mmorpgs are, character progression.
[3:19:42] kennymcorn: so its kinda worth cous i have nothing to do in the life i dont know what for game i  want to play
[3:19:49] mauroxadi: will wotlk even have the same feel as it used to? I think that since eveyone knows what to do and everyone is hardcore elitist nowadays and tryhards, it wont be as nostalgia makes you think it will
[3:20:19] chimerablaque: its never gonna be 2008 again, but it will be fun
[3:20:35] SoulboundxTV: @mauroxadi just play on a smaller server, maybe rp-pvp server. They usually have a smaller tight-knitted community.
[3:20:47] solsaver12: I agree @chimerablaque
[3:20:55] kennymcorn: i have lvl 50 charter
[3:21:00] seabass40: i only got up to level 40 on classic
[3:21:04] seabass40: cause the queue times was so nuts
[3:21:13] valtermp2: how many achievs points you have ?
[3:21:17] delirious555: Wotlk was WoW in it's best state. It should be really fun. I've been playing a lot on Warmane.
[3:21:24] solsaver12: yeah som is for a year
[3:21:27] rapt00r4: 16/17 november or something like that
[3:21:51] SoulboundxTV: it was too early for som

[3:22:24] hera1621: what expansion did you have most fun
[3:22:37] SoulboundxTV: prot warrior still have a spot in 3s. Its meta in 3v3 private servers
[3:22:37] sheerheartattackyk: glaive on my realm went for 130k
[3:22:43] mauroxadi: I'd like to play DK on WotLK to experience the OG dk. Never played DK

[3:24:06] mauroxadi: @sheerheartattackyk Yes. it took me a while to realise that blood was the new tank
[3:24:08] seabass40: dk with the legendary was a prob

[3:24:46] sheerheartattackyk: frost was going to be the first dw tank but they changed that, double dk blood in arenas was frustrating
[3:25:05] delirious555: I heard unholy dk had no counters in pvp. Prot can beat unholy dk?

[3:27:55] Brastias: pvp in wrath was stupidly broken especially at the beginning
