[0:44:58] Laaash: @Jakori depending, the wolf in burning steppes is bis because of it's attackspeed/dmg and before that the rare tiger (brokentooth iirc) is the 2nd best for same reason. so they are more of a minmax option. Wolves are bis in wrath duo to ap buff but classic you want owl/bat or either mentioned above
