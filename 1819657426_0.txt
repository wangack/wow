[5:20:33] 91Niki: @Shrenko Yes change to world tier 1!
[5:20:41] Baladore: @Shrenko SeemsGood insanely easier
[5:20:58] 91Niki: @Shrenko and if you see low level people in the area, ask them kindly to leave. Some people don't know they HAVE to be level 20
[5:22:30] Shrenko: @91Niki yeah I will definetly tell them to lvl 20 first. But the spawn in 30minutes will be the last one I think, but changing to Tier 1 should definetly be enough time to get her down
[5:23:02] Baladore: @Shrenko Good luck!
