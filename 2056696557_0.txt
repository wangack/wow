[0:53:29] Taylor131313: would be funny for a streamer, hat on top of headset on top of bandana on top of wig KEKL
[0:53:31] Aegis_2566: Do you know why pirates wore eye patches?
[0:53:36] DigADino: and a coin hanging from under your bandana
[0:53:43] Collnaris: OMEGALUL
[0:53:48] RhonaDext: Love the outfit and looks. Great work!
[0:53:55] Criss_xc: the color too
[0:54:03] Collnaris: you get those fake dreads LUL
[0:54:09] mahirejderha: hi
[0:54:10] tauruzzilverz: @AnnieFuchsia is your Ubisoft launcher working?
[0:54:13] Aegis_2566: To prepare the hidden eye when going into lower decks which were alot darker, so they'd just switch the eye
[0:54:17] Sne4ky79: @tuamoh not an actual berry
[0:54:20] loppish91: did you see this how much it cost twitch to host streams https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1755350976746447211
[0:54:22] Criss_xc: like it was made for you xd
[0:54:25] mahirejderha: you look beautiful
[0:54:27] Geoffku: you gonna get the boots and sword too?
[0:54:31] tuamoh: @Sne4ky79 Ok thanks :)
[0:54:32] Domahkin: A few more cosplays and you'll be able to launch a 2025 calendar
[0:54:37] Criss_xc: server are lunched i guess
[0:54:38] thatdogbitme: @Aegis_2566 that makes sense, we did something like that in the army
[0:54:51] Taylor131313: it's cheaper because it's hosted on amazon probably
[0:55:00] arrenaz: You are my favorite stream, no only fans shit you are a real one top G
[0:55:04] Morgonbladet: 200%, you can always buy compute power in advance for discount
[0:55:06] Wardrick7: yes that calculator is very inaccurate but streaming services are still very expensive
[0:55:12] Sne4ky79: @tuamoh probably a mix of berries
[0:55:25] Morgonbladet: like book up servers for x years
[0:55:25] AnnieFuchsia: https://twitter.com/stale2000/status/1755441845038190709
[0:55:31] Aegis_2566: Pirates wore eye patches to prepare the hidden eye for seeing better in the dark, for example going lower deck @AnnieFuchsia
[0:55:34] C9_dead: HypeDisguise anniesPet
[0:55:37] 0ddskar: bru, your outfit is awesome
[0:55:40] tuamoh: @Sne4ky79 Yeah I was trying to taste test it but I couldn't figure out which berry it is supposed to be LUL
[0:56:00] tuamoh: But yeah a mix sounds correct
[0:56:13] Morgonbladet: This is why Twitch are moving the heavy lifting to NVIDIA gpus in streamers PCs LUL it’s so smart
[0:56:16] Aegis_2566: Yea, lower deck were alot darker on ships back in the days
[0:56:28] Collnaris: one eye was for looking at night
[0:56:31] Morgonbladet: Cloud is always someone else’s computer
[0:56:40] Wardrick7: also big companies always get deals
[0:56:41] Geoffku: smalding KEKLEO
[0:56:43] Taylor131313: smalding to dress KEKLEO
[0:56:44] tuamoh: I heard Ubi is also considering a AC4: Black Flag remake... which is kinda weird because they should be focusing fully on Skull & Bones tbh.
[0:56:46] Turbopumper: yeah and you wouldn't want to bring a torch into a room full of black powder barrels LUL
[0:56:54] Buescheric: Wait, where is Annie and why has a pirate "entered" her room?

[0:57:32] Sne4ky79: looks great
[0:57:32] Morgonbladet: They might still do in terms of free credits but that pay full price with those credits
[0:57:35] bambooooh: it's wild to see you as a brunette again after so long :D

[0:58:08] tuamoh: To this day, Booty Bay definitely doesn't make me think of treasure first LUL
[0:58:09] epic_smee: I think its very likely that Amazon will drop Twitch and rent out their framework, like they already do with kick
[0:58:21] Turbopumper: no way LUL
[0:58:24] Aegis_2566: To fonish the pirate cosplay you should buy a rolls royce olympus concorde engine, would match perfectly
[0:58:29] Geoffku: ...
[0:58:29] Collnaris: wat KEKW
[0:58:30] b0vril: Since Disney is getting rid of Jack Sparrow entirely, I wouldn't spend to much money on a Jack Sparrow hat.

[1:18:35] PaleDegen: more colors but you gotta have a monitor that supports it
[1:18:37] cynicalrapture: HDR- High dynamic range
[1:18:38] heavyharmonies: dynamic range, extended gamut between whites and blacks.
[1:18:38] wotca_: @RhonaDext This guy is right, it's not rsolution
[1:18:39] BattleHulk87: HDR = High dynamic range it adds better brightness etc
[1:18:40] Aegis_2566: No updated gpu drivers
[1:18:41] darthcookiejar: Hight Dynamic Range   its only if your monitor has it
