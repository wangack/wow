[0:46:59] swampt1l: First time leveling would be campaign and then alts would be dungeons?
[0:47:02] MorteaWolf17: Prot pally life for ever
[0:47:02] Kinghorn: smash that revenge button
[0:47:33] TheUnknowing: I'm assuming they will do what they did with shadowlands and have a twist of fate type scenario @zeuussss_
[0:48:08] swampt1l: That is too true,I wouldn’t mind that @theunknowing
[0:48:12] Kinghorn: leveling is gonna be linear like shadowlands right, zone to zone to zone

[0:50:55] zsombee19: And how is dk-s doing in Dragonflight?
[0:51:08] swampt1l: Are there tier sets in DF too?
[0:51:10] Skars111: so since this is Final phase of alpha does that mean BETA next week?

[0:58:00] Cooboomy: I dont understand the reason for nerfing it.
[0:58:41] Silverwards: it's already on a 5min cooldown that starts after you land. it's never gonna replace any other form of flying
[0:59:56] xeeeoN: I don't like that Cleanse Toxins is a talent now. I play Ret and use that spell so often but I think i can't take that talent because others are more important

[1:03:00] swampt1l: Did you see blizzard is thinking of giving hunters an ability that makes LoS non existent?
[1:03:30] cajunw33dh3ad: You think they will still nerf it even though all of the feedbacks on it be nerfed
[1:04:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it was MM that has an ability that shoots through walls and pillars, it's silly to me

[1:04:57] swampt1l: It’s covenant ability Resonating strike for hunters @weirdo_dude
[1:05:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Part of outplaying ranged damage is to use line of sight....they shouldn't make things go through walls
[1:06:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Things like that remind me of multistike....it might be kind of fun at times, but it's just silly
[1:07:53] swampt1l: Healers gonna shit themselves LUL

[1:21:43] Samurai3434: what are your thoughts on the new Prot Pally tree?
[1:22:37] king_julian_96: sup towelliee you never goign to believ what happend to me today i thought i would never get the alpha checked my launcher and boom what was there dragonflight alpah that's right i got the alpha towelliee
[1:22:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: THey could do another stat squish, things are going up fast, but I think they said there is no plan for it in Dragonflight
[1:22:59] calvofurioso: @wEiRdO_dUdE its almost doubled from start of shadowlands to s4 x.x
[1:23:29] DarkviperTV: 1/3 of the damage now
[1:23:37] swampt1l: As long as they don’t legion item levels LUL
[1:23:58] Aero__TV: additional 63 aswell :(
[1:24:05] Aero__TV: instead of 1k
[1:24:38] Woodland_Critter: It bothers me its not fastest to slowest or vice versa
[1:24:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: 640% is still freakishly fast
[1:25:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it would matter how much time it can even spend at top speed
[1:25:26] Kaernunnos: the order on screen is weird though, medium-fast-slow instead of slow -medium-fast
[1:25:31] Skars111: the reasoning is the main thing people saying stuff imo just doesnt make sense
[1:25:42] BitsyOD: I still think they should revert it i feel like blizz's argument of getting to pet battles and transmog hunting is a very weak argument
[1:25:47] calvofurioso: my question is, was the nerf needed for some kind of technical limitations or just fun detected
[1:25:55] redfernn: seems you just get from A to B in half the time.
[1:26:04] Woodland_Critter: @Kaernunnos Ye, that was the point I was trying to make.
[1:26:05] Shatraugh: in sports  the winner always has the middle spot on the thing
[1:26:18] DarkviperTV: @calvofurioso Fun detected 100%
[1:26:28] Shifty_CZ: well 10 sec on this distance
[1:26:39] Shaele: he moves faster? And so what?
[1:27:09] king_julian_96: sup towelliee you never going to believe what happend to me today i thought i would never get the alpha checked my launcher and boom what was there dragonflight alpha that's right i got the alpha towelliee
[1:27:09] Aero__TV: dark iron can mule teleport faster anyway :)
[1:27:22] Shaele: not sure how this could be exploited in any meaningful way besides showing off to friends
[1:27:28] Redshaman999: its true
[1:27:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: In prepatch there will be a ton of evokers flying around, but I think with the launch it's not going to be too insane
[1:27:48] Shifty_CZ: ye eu got bunch of random invites
[1:27:55] Woodland_Critter: How many are online right now @Towelliee ?
[1:28:25] D3m0nHunt3r666: how many dungeons have been tested so far?

[1:31:24] devilzragee: @devilzragee oh nice.
[1:31:43] devilzragee: how the heck do you set up the ability bar to where it shows everything like that? (new af to wow here)
[1:32:01] devilzragee: and how it shows the party members lfie
[1:32:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah there shouldn't be any loss of aggro
[1:32:09] king_julian_96: just got 2 bosses left of my heroic fated rading SLG nad sire and once there doen iam jumping in to play alpha bois
[1:32:11] Woodland_Critter: @devilzragee This is the new alpha UI.
[1:32:32] devilzragee: @Woodland_Critter ohhhh nice. thats gonna be nice then. thought it was something already in current ui.
[1:32:37] devilzragee: combined backpack looks nice too
[1:33:00] Aero__TV: with new expansion you can edit lots of stuff with out addons @devilzragee
[1:33:12] Alaquane: I could never use any backpack except the murloc ones
[1:33:35] devilzragee: @Aero__TV so its available to everyone whose already bought dragonflight or only once release?
[1:33:45] deadman385: Are those new default nameplates
[1:33:54] Stiffy84: is fury super OP or something?
[1:34:11] Woodland_Critter: @devilzragee It will come with pre-patch, but the UI is still not finalized.
[1:34:14] Aero__TV: probbly in prepatch if not after release but my vote prepatch @devilzragee
[1:34:17] MKBragg: Are warriors that broken right now?
[1:34:20] Torse9: Torse9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 99 months! 
[1:34:28] Thoreya: arms is fine :)
[1:34:42] devilzragee: ahh gotcha ty @Aero__TV @Woodland_Critter
[1:34:44] TheUnknowing: yeah warrior is super broken
[1:34:52] Artful_Dodger: Yeah, prepatch usually has the new stuff.
[1:34:52] devilzragee: are dk's good? (idk about meta and im a dk)
[1:34:54] Woodland_Critter: I want to see a 5 man Warrior group. For science.
[1:34:58] datmikez: do you know why they are busted ?
[1:34:58] Aero__TV: SMOrc correctly balanced
[1:35:01] Voidred: i mean if they are fine that just means every other character isnt and is gonna get buffs

[1:35:06] devilzragee: also will i lose all my current gear and skill levels and currency on reset with dragonflight?
[1:35:11] ChillinMoose: Working as intended
[1:35:29] D3m0nHunt3r666: warrios busted early expansion , thats not meant to happen Kappa
[1:35:33] Sathfire: fan of the new WoW UI?
[1:36:13] Aero__TV: @devilzragee you will replace gear with new expansion gear currencies saved, you will pick skills in new talent trees
[1:36:30] mayubaem93: mayubaem93 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:36:39] Sathfire: true, i love it
[1:36:43] TheUnknowing: the new ui stuff is nice, but i dont see myself switching from what I already use
[1:36:43] xeeeoN: @Towelliee do you know if we get the new UI and talents in a pre patch before the new addon?
[1:36:53] devilzragee: @Aero__TV so it would be pointless for me to level up my current skills then? since im just going to lose them and all.
[1:37:05] TheUnknowing: it will be in prepatch @xeeeoN
[1:37:21] xeeeoN: ok thanks
[1:37:43] devilzragee: do you feel like the new ui makes it easier for people who are new or trying to learn different classes? since theyd be able to see everything visually in front of them instead of cycling bars?
[1:37:49] paddystar11: Will we ever find out what the big bad was the jailer wanted to "save us" from? LOL
[1:38:05] bricko89: @paddystar11 Probably at the end of dragonflight
[1:38:05] xeeeoN: ok that's nice. I want to make my new UI ready for DF ^^
[1:38:35] Stiffy84: gbus....
[1:38:55] paddystar11: @bricko89 ya hope so, feels bad enough that the whole story of shadowlands was basically 1 cliffhanger, even though i personally likes the "side stories"
[1:39:00] lithium364: soar change buyable in the store?
[1:39:00] Thoreya: to not have bad pr

[1:39:28] Onvious: @paddystar11 blizz probably already forgot that plot point :P
[1:39:32] Artiiz: Have they been hotfixing pallys any?
[1:39:32] Aero__TV: @devilzragee its your choice, now season 4 released still lots of stuff you can do if you want, or you can wait for prepatch and start there
[1:39:36] D3m0nHunt3r666: to please everyone, if you hear too much complain then its not a good change :p
[1:39:54] Artful_Dodger: There isn't enough difference between the nerf and pre nerf speed.
[1:40:03] devilzragee: @Aero__TV gotcha. ill probably save my 10k gold and wait.

[1:44:01] devilzragee: cuz as a new player i can confidently say i dont like it
[1:44:01] gooseboy429: its a whole new world
[1:44:08] soulbr0: what are your favorite mechanics added in new expansion?
[1:44:17] Sathfire: im loving it too @Doublezoh
[1:44:19] TheUnknowing: ive never skipped an expansion and probably never will, no matter how bad the game is I typically still play lol
[1:44:22] Dadghar: like all the people that left for FF14 they will be back for DF
[1:44:35] Sathfire: lmao exactly, not skipping at all
[1:44:37] Cerantoman: I skipped cata

[1:45:10] Necoc: @Towelliee I skipped from BC to Legion
[1:45:12] Citrosis: i will say tho that im excited for wrath
[1:45:24] deadman385: I’m not an alcoholic I only drink every other day
[1:45:39] devilzragee: i only played the whole story and 90% of the content. i skipped it. COPIUM
[1:45:50] Alaquane: I did not buy panda or wod, prepurchased Legion and played a tiny bit of wod in Legion prepatch
[1:45:54] xarlo12: New player here, Shadowlands felt like a second job, I hope dragonflight won't feel like that
[1:46:07] devilzragee: this^^^^
[1:46:11] BillBob605: If you paid Blizzard for the XPac then you didnt skip it PERIOD
[1:46:14] ms_enyo: mmos are a job lol
[1:46:16] lithium364: im skipping this patch tho, my guild is not coming back
[1:46:23] xarlo12: LUL
[1:46:26] SOLOM4LE: Only playing WoW for the first week of an expansion that lasts like 2 years in my eyes is skipping
[1:46:29] Yazmic: I havent had a max level since MOP so i think i skipped a couple of days
[1:46:37] bricko89: SL is the most alt friendly xpac in history
[1:46:49] Cerantoman: Atm sl is nice. You can easy alt now and its realy fun
[1:46:50] bricko89: wow historyu
[1:46:51] Scoodles91: maybe khortia, but other then that barely anything
[1:46:54] Cr1Xus23: How is Prot feeling? I play a Prot as well, but didn't get the Alpha
[1:46:58] soulbr0: what level was your necklace in bfa @Towelliee
[1:47:00] Exoduc: Korthia shivers
[1:47:29] Beerens0601: i hate what they did to warlock incinerate not walk cast and remodel the chaos bolt.. mop locks where the best
[1:47:40] blinca: i miss legion concordance levels tbh
[1:47:45] UntraceableBG: They are not
[1:47:49] devilzragee: i havent noticed that on retail
[1:47:53] jkitchin75: no
[1:48:00] zysmos: It's not like that currently no
[1:48:01] romann921: Theyer all radioactive now
[1:48:05] zysmos: great addition
[1:48:36] devilzragee: how do you qualify for wow alphas?
[1:48:55] zysmos: I wish they'd just display more things on the map tho
[1:49:09] PorosTv: ı got alpha today
[1:49:16] Sathfire: have u tried Evoker? I heard it was "clunky"
[1:49:16] romann921: Can i put you down as a reference tho?
[1:49:22] gooseboy429: im not that lucky
[1:49:26] lithium364: lies ion loves me i will get alpha Kappa
[1:49:38] romann921: :(
[1:49:42] School_Toilets: The alpha we got today is until august 8 so it's an alpha weekend
[1:49:53] PapaJohnz23: PapaJohnz23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[1:49:54] Artful_Dodger: Nice try though.  :D
[1:50:07] devilzragee: when does df release?
[1:50:08] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[1:50:11] devilzragee: isnt it like december?
[1:50:37] StupendousHam: do you think these public tests ruin the "magic" of the release
[1:50:56] devilzragee: @StupendousHam if you care that much just dont watch.
[1:50:59] devilzragee: 5head
[1:51:45] MOXP: so rather next year
[1:51:54] devilzragee: so november or 2023
[1:52:02] soulbr0: @Towelliee what are your favorite features of the new expansion\
[1:52:18] vallinae: and how did that go last expansion lol
[1:52:29] StupendousHam: @devilzragee why so aggressive.  I didn't ask you
[1:52:29] Aero__TV: :D
[1:52:45] Artful_Dodger: This alpha looks more complete than previous ones.
[1:52:47] Skobble: How do you like what you have seen so far? @Towelliee
[1:52:48] devilzragee: @StupendousHam just saying man. wasnt aggressive
[1:53:20] dracullus: I wonder if we get date on Gamescom if they are really determined to release it in 2022
[1:53:21] Coriollis: most polished alpha ever
[1:53:29] Kaernunnos: the lack of all specs is the only real thing keeping it in alpha status
[1:53:32] akia03: also no systems that need balancing
[1:53:56] swampt1l: Goodnight hammer squad towF
[1:54:03] dracullus: looks like they assumed long alpha water down hype a little
[1:54:17] Coriollis: u forgot the drachtyr appearence , I still consider it a abug Kappa
[1:54:47] paddystar11: Hey towelliee, i didnt really catch that one: How do you change talents btw (restzone?)? Is there a talent-manager in "vanilla"?
[1:54:57] ImSnckPck: I thought expacs were being developed 2 expacs in advance?
[1:54:58] Aero__TV: @Coriollis OMEGALUL
[1:55:15] Kaernunnos: i mean that alpha generally means missing systems, beta is bug fixing. lack of specs is technically missing systems
[1:55:32] lithium364: hes forgetting about pvp BabyRage
[1:55:36] calvofurioso: having no borrowed power bullshit to add to balance out probably helps too
[1:56:17] xotankkk: but how borring would be the talent trees if we didnt have borroed power till now lol
[1:56:21] vallinae: @o_illusionz bare minimum tho given how much i pay to play the game
[1:56:27] calvofurioso: yeah but its baseline for the specs, no extra questlines and scenarios to unlock
[1:56:31] 1sammee: godamn u looked geared hehe
[1:56:47] calvofurioso: so refurbished borrowed powrers and focusing on other stuff
[1:57:04] Silverwards: but where's Twilight Devastation?! Madge
[1:57:20] Alaquane: no infinite stars? :(
[1:57:28] romann921: no new spells :(
[1:57:30] Gadgari: Hi towelliee. Have wunder about stagger. let say i get hit by 100k and my parry dodge take 50% off it is it that stagger take the rest of the 50% and use it as a dot over sec a or do i have it wrong
[1:57:30] soth_klf: eye of tyr not good enough for Prot Pally?
[1:57:32] IchabodCrain: the difference though, is you only have to get the systems into place. after that it's just balancing
[1:57:51] Aero__TV: you didnt get any of last points in class tree is it not enough talent points or not worth?
[1:57:52] Skars111: its class power now?
[1:57:56] zysmos: they don't have to timegate acquisition tho
[1:57:57] Nearacle__: given back power?
[1:58:07] Nearacle__: returned power
[1:58:10] Dwaggle: Probably just with a brand new talent tree
[1:58:13] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: prob gonna go further down
[1:58:16] xotankkk: expand the tree like POE lol
[1:58:37] IchabodCrain: sounds like a question for ion
[1:58:40] zysmos: i'd say they'd add more choice
[1:58:42] soth_klf: yea they need to expand the tree the more levels we get again
[1:58:52] Aro725: I hope they add divine toll conduit. It feels so bad without it on alpha
[1:59:08] soth_klf: nice
[1:59:10] netneon: Maybe pvp Gear has extra skillls on the items itselfs
[1:59:10] almostdps: poe style, only select hp nodes and then get all offensive stuff off gear.
[1:59:13] Exoduc: Nice
[1:59:17] MOXP: 69? nice
[1:59:21] Aero__TV: where is my spell supression Kappa
[1:59:24] deadman385: 69
[1:59:24] Alepouditsa: and the will give a map skill tree to? danPanic
[1:59:26] Kaernunnos: go true full poe, no more individual classes, everything is just a massive tree you choose a starting point on
[1:59:33] Aro725: Thats the name. Ringing clarity.
[1:59:34] soth_klf: @Aero__TV nerfed LUL
[1:59:39] StupendousHam: im all for Poe tree lol
[1:59:43] Finiin: they need to do something like ESO
[1:59:47] killuminativi: yo man, did they update retpal tree?
[1:59:52] Grizzlymaller: So how's the New Trees going @Towelliee
[1:59:57] Aro725: Yep, that would be so sweet.
[2:00:03] almostdps: @Kaernunnos and then blizz can say that your choices are wrong because you made a necro summoner and nerf it
[2:00:11] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: does divine toll generate hp or did they not implement that yet?
[2:00:25] Epixil: hey towelliee any look at the engineering prof yet?
[2:00:28] lithium364: shaman tree is great
[2:01:00] Kaernunnos: @Kaernunnos pretty sure they did that a few years ago for a warlock spec... unless my memory is failing me
[2:01:01] Aro725: I feel like i have wayyyy less buttons than i do in SL
[2:01:01] Trifeca: shaman tree is the best
[2:01:02] Aero__TV: im just gonna import from others :)
[2:01:47] almostdps: borrowed power is gear, because gear isnt permanent 4Head

[2:03:02] Kaernunnos: borrowed power has been there for a LONG time, in tier sets. Legion just made it front and center and put community focus on it
[2:03:03] soth_klf: Convergence of Fates is the only Borrowed Power i want
[2:03:03] Skars111: the thing that was bad about it was most of the borrowed power you had to grind for DF you dont have to grind for your borrowed power @Towelliee
[2:03:12] Triist0ne: wake of ashes Kreygasm
[2:03:35] Alaquane: hitting what, 115? 116 in bfa hurt

[2:26:50] Dagomarus: 9.1 zone maybe
[2:26:55] Lambyyx: there is a theory that's where the new night eld world tree is going to be planted
[2:27:22] Cakeabsorber: I wonder how long the nightelves will be homeless for KEKW
[2:27:35] ashwing_: Wouldnt that tree take decades to grow?
[2:27:36] JerBoody: @savagecheez It’s really good imo…love Moscow mules but don’t love the hangover I get from all the sugar in ginger beer so
[2:27:43] Dagomarus: makes senses, its just big enough to fit a world tree in that area
[2:27:45] Wolfenhoof: A new capital for the nelves in an expansion zone i find rather unlikely though.
[2:27:54] xotankkk: merithra will be the next green dragonflight
[2:27:56] BoezIRL: bronze magic
[2:27:59] calvofurioso: maybe they just plant it

[2:29:21] Aero__TV: thrall also can beam to tree Kappa
[2:29:46] SavageCheez: Have you tried Lux's Peach Tea?
[2:29:47] Arendiel_: Teldrassil also grown this way by the druids, they doesn't even needed the dragons help
[2:29:53] Sathfire: why not blood elf pally?
[2:29:54] Dagomarus: i would be disapointed if there wasnt a quest where its called "Nozdormu, Ive come to bargain" as a reference to doctor strange
[2:30:03] Daddyknut: Camp Towelliee next
[2:30:12] xotankkk: there will be a garden
[2:30:14] Artiiz: That would be so dope

[2:30:31] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[2:30:36] xotankkk: isnt there gardening gear on the alpha?
[2:30:40] Leruxia: The Arcanocrystal is still relevant if you still need to do the new Mage Tower stuff.
[2:31:01] Noshpan: I suspect the event of the seed being planted & the tree growing will be done in some upcoming novel.
[2:31:12] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)

[2:33:08] Odd3ty: What is the advance?

[2:33:25] Alaquane: new drink sponsor?
[2:33:53] Artiiz: Do you think it will be faster to fly by dragonriding of flight path?
[2:34:01] Alaquane: that's neat
[2:34:04] TomCat: good morning
[2:34:40] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee Are the creators in the special discord pushing blizzard to revert the flight speed nerf to Drak?

[2:51:42] Artiiz: I agree, these rewards they give now are complete garbage
[2:51:46] BlewGamingGroup: theyre only useful to not have to change out gear while leveling . since they took the xp boost off em ... then suck
[2:51:54] xotankkk: they lost a lot of theire power you can actually feel it while lvling
[2:52:00] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee Are the creators in the special discord pushing to have the flight speed nerf reverted?
[2:52:57] mojusk: i just got alpha wtf
[2:53:00] TomCat: choline and inositol - pretty solid for focus
[2:53:15] BlewGamingGroup: all they have on them is slower use of your rested . but if your serious about leveling . youre not going to sit around long enough to let the rested get to 150%
[2:53:40] mojusk: any other new player mentors got it?

[2:58:55] Leruxia: World First Race, Castle Nathria Pt. 2!
[2:59:02] chambiann: @Jimstur think it was warrior
[2:59:05] kimmo_gaming: RWF revisited it should be called LOL
[2:59:38] Jimstur: @cptainbian seems a bit underwhelming for a weeks worth of testing

[4:31:09] Fibnkak: or the day after the blizzcon that isn't happening
[4:31:09] konoko8: so during the time when 90% of blizzard employees are not there and something big goes down like a huge bug it wont be fixed for weeks?
[4:31:21] fistofnature: Busy farming headless horseman insted of new expansion LUL
[4:31:37] Literae: We dont do Thanksgiving in the EU Kappa
[4:31:40] SpoofAvatar: no turkey /cry
[4:32:02] SpoofAvatar: 28th would be best :P
[4:32:05] Literae: Eat at your desk Kappa
[4:32:16] SpoofAvatar: nov 28th*
[4:32:24] ExpectDragons: how much notice will they give us?
[4:32:34] manmower: that's when you get called on your work phone
[4:32:56] Fibnkak: 20 devs making double time and a half for holiday work
[4:32:58] ExpectDragons: I've worked Christmas before, someone has too when other have kids to look after
[4:33:17] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Next expansion World of Gobblecraft, Turkey Crusade
[4:33:28] manmower: dragonriding race nerfs
[4:33:28] ShadoodHD: sounds like a jinx >.>
[4:33:48] konoko8: Do you think it's actually doable for a november release though??
[4:34:18] andre_scb: do you think game is at least half ready?
[4:36:27] ExpectDragons: have the pvp talents changed much?
[4:36:35] BlewGamingGroup: they will
[4:36:39] Coriollis: u know thwy will :)
[4:36:39] skymercii: its the internet
[4:36:41] skymercii: they will
[4:36:50] manmower: those looked like normal warrior numbers
[4:37:11] aid280: thats far too much fun
[4:38:05] Kheonik: @Towelliee choice between having more defensiveness or more damage pretty much, cd reduction to guardian or divine toll
[4:38:07] Skyxiemeister: beta will be beta ^^
[4:40:07] Coriollis: we hear u Kappa

[4:40:41] Armdel: "thanks for the feedback, however.."
[4:41:15] Wolfenhoof: "We hear you." (We give a fuck, but we hear you Kappa )
[4:41:15] Coriollis: "that beeing said "
[4:41:33] sshadeh: same as shadow priests having trait that gives them slight absorb shield from vampiric touch overhealing, as one of the talents that lead to the really strong ones
[4:41:34] sshadeh: LUL
[4:41:36] Fibnkak: Wait can a warrior shatter a Pally bubble?
[4:41:39] andre_scb: same as warlocks...1 mistake and we are OP
[4:41:40] sshadeh: its so shit, and takes several points
[4:41:40] manmower: fine line with paladins
[4:41:53] TheKitsuneAdventures: World of Paladincraft: Rise of the Light
[4:42:09] manmower: with shields and heals, can easily have paladins soloing mythic bosses
[4:42:32] Gooseberries: The curse is playing shadow priest
[4:43:11] sshadeh: they have been listening to feedback surprisingly much
[4:43:22] sshadeh: its good that they release only few at a time
[4:43:33] sshadeh: so people can focus
[4:43:44] tr0kgaming: Does divine toll give ringing clarity ?
[4:43:51] hookkz: im glad about the work they put in talents
[4:43:59] manmower: i hope they balance the talents so we can go crazy
[4:44:00] geros2013: good morning. Dont you feel you pidgeonholed in the middle lane on the prot tree. For GotAK and its modifiers?
[4:44:09] sshadeh: KEKW
[4:44:16] alextheblight: LUL
[4:44:20] andre_scb: Warlock tree will be last...i bet its so broken
[4:44:21] Coriollis: fun police working overtime
[4:44:40] Tyrsfal: I watched a comparison vid from the nerf to what it was before, it does look slower. Admittedly it's alot faster than flying now... just seems a shame
[4:45:23] Molvonos: At the beginning of the expac, I can see tanks going more defensive for survival as raids and M+'s are learned, and then swapping to more offensive options
[4:45:29] Coriollis: its a 5 min cd, every other race has an imbalance racial exceptgnomes, but who cares about gnomes
[4:45:33] geros2013: I feel its a bit low on the tree, but maybe thats just me
[4:45:34] sshadeh: different builds for different content

[4:45:42] sshadeh: its nice they promised several loadouts for talents
[4:46:41] Literae: I loved the glow near hidden demons on the shield Kreygasm
[4:46:41] alextheblight: it was pretty good
[4:47:38] LeGoogs: He does.
[4:47:54] Nionamot: WW monks praying that Strike of the windlord will be on thier talent tree
[4:48:00] manmower: im sure everyone will stop complaining about it now
[4:48:08] ExpectDragons: why do we have to choose between cleanse & rebuke?
[4:48:48] almostdps: Soar is the most OP racial ability in the game, if they make it a class ability instead maybe it wont matter.
[4:48:49] ashwing_: big drama over dumb shit
[4:49:12] Skars111: idk theres heaps of people arguing the change on forums too
[4:49:16] StoicTaurus: But it's just soar .. not entire Dragonriding
[4:49:26] Coriollis: u gotta admit thou faster = fun :)
[4:49:34] manmower: just put that on a CD on par with Zandalari, is that like 15min?
[4:49:39] CraftyClaw: @almostdps It basically is a class ability since dracthyr cannot be any other class
[4:49:40] Literae: People arguing about all these stupid problems, but all I want is Kul Tiran Paladins LUL
[4:49:50] sitmeee: LUL
[4:49:50] andre_scb: why nerf FUN?
[4:50:00] Larc9783: Look at me. I'm the developer now
[4:50:13] BlewGamingGroup: its just blizzard doing blizzard things
[4:50:14] Gravity16: good morning @Towelliee  & Chat - most fun low level pvp levelling alt?
[4:50:21] Ziddrax: just increase the other mounts speed and keep the draktyr speed
[4:50:34] Literae: "Can it be used in combat?" "No" "Then why does it matter" Soar Arguement Case Closed DatSheffy
[4:50:38] manmower: Blizz saw the video, they said they're gonna slow it down further
[4:50:41] MammothGB: I saw someone suggest, what if the original soar speed was actually what you unlock at max level dragon riding and the "nerf" is what you start with
[4:50:44] geros2013: My tinfoil theory on that nerf is that they know when Dracthyr will be other classes starting at lvl 10, so they did it for that but could not say it.
[4:50:48] fbirobertmueller805: I wouldn’t listen to “content creatures haha 😂
[4:51:03] andre_scb: blizzard nerfing things so they can bring back and be the good guys ...lmao
[4:51:06] Coriollis: I'm sure players play the game for locomotion mechanics
[4:51:18] almostdps: no cooldown but it only goes epic mount speed now
[4:51:32] yaashs: i bet like 80% of anyone complaining about the dractyr flying nerf, wont even play an evoker
[4:51:34] WymGaming: the video Max posted showed almost a 30sec difference on the same tunnel route with soar
[4:51:34] sitmeee: Maybe they need to cry more. LUL
[4:51:40] manmower: just make it only work where dragonriding is enabled
[4:52:01] almostdps: @manmower people would bitch way more about that
[4:52:05] Literae: I think it should have no CD on Dragon Isles, only have a CD on other continents
[4:52:13] Literae: Also DH should have Soar too Kappa
[4:52:14] Pursuit01: it's the concept tho
[4:52:21] yaashs: Well its a good thing that this is the biggest complaint so far though, thats a good sign in my book :D
[4:52:37] Wolfenhoof: @Literae Tauren should have it too !
[4:52:37] Youredoneson666: But Drak will be the new farming race. I think they'll beat out druids just because of the passives
[4:52:43] Rabiahtaro132: "Kyle they nursed my alpha warriors rhat were perfectly balanced, Kyle!"
[4:53:02] manmower: we need to see the world content still
[4:53:02] yaashs: haha good
[4:53:03] Coriollis: listen when dragonflying is better atm and will get ALOT better through the expansion and soar will be still nerfed that will be a slap
[4:53:04] Literae: @Literae Give them back landstrider from Vanilla Alpha (or whatever it was called)
[4:53:06] sitmeee: Just like the lock nerf they postponed till season 4 and after the nerf still locks are doing great. Like it rained in the  aoe RoF spam but thats it
[4:53:06] Kurpto: Let everyone do dragon riding everywhere and go fast af. ex fix.
[4:53:07] Ziddrax: for now Kappa
[4:53:13] liftedinxinfinity: not really the talents are a mess
[4:53:15] smol_gunner: well coz DF has no content or systems to complain about if we are honest @Towelliee
[4:53:22] andre_scb: what if they fix it? what can we complain about? Kappa
[4:53:27] ExpectDragons: I started in BFA so i've had to 'bad' expansions lol so looking forward to playing a good one
[4:53:36] Getitonthelow: It’s evoker even that good?
[4:53:40] yaashs: Talents are in development, the SYSTEM of talents is a good system
[4:53:43] liftedinxinfinity: not ''mages ''
[4:53:44] Literae: I just want Holy Paladin to be released FeelsBadMan
[4:54:03] sitmeee: Facts!
[4:54:18] drbonesawmd: #meaningfulchoice
[4:54:29] Inzidious: agreed
[4:54:33] Manjoe81: can't wait for DH! I hope they do a big overhaul.
[4:54:43] manmower: cooking has talents
[4:54:44] liftedinxinfinity: the whole 3 specs for mages is a total mess, and u got all the streamers agreeing that play it
[4:54:44] sitmeee: People are just gonna copy builds off wowhead and such instead of thinking for themsleves.
[4:54:45] ShadoodHD: ah yes the meta -- i mean "meaningful" -- choice
[4:54:45] Rabiahtaro132: You can't please everyone.
[4:54:49] madziim: thats really good
[4:54:55] asmodai4823: there will be cookie cutter for sure
[4:55:14] andre_scb: people will still use the best whatever build X pro uses
[4:55:21] manmower: no cooking talents yet =/
[4:55:21] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[4:55:24] sitmeee: I'm so excited for the new talent tree
[4:55:38] almostdps: There will literally be a cookie cutter no matter what, they could put 5000000 talents on the tree and people would be like "this one set of choices is .00001% better"
[4:55:39] Inzidious: nohing wroong with copying builds
[4:55:45] StoicTaurus: There should be at least talent in Cooking tree called "Cookie cutter"
[4:56:04] sitmeee: Pancake cutter
[4:56:08] Larc9783: 3D printed
[4:56:11] ShadoodHD: ... meta? towTinfoil
[4:56:13] manmower: lack of meaningful choice
[4:56:15] Rabiahtaro132: I'm going to make my own builds and compare it with other builds to see the differance.
[4:56:23] Pursuit01: I dont even cut my cookies
[4:56:28] almostdps: its just aoe or st basically, maybe a m+ build to mix it
[4:56:29] tr0kgaming: Like templates or something like that
[4:56:51] UntraceableBG: Why would you even cut your cookie?
[4:56:54] geros2013: If they manage fight variety well you are correct
[4:56:55] akia03: isnt that only really a few specs that can do that
[4:56:58] Ziddrax: knowing blizzard they might not allow you to change talents while in raid/dgs
[4:57:05] spicymangobaby: why make the trees top down. make then a circle and start from the middle?
[4:57:20] jojoman12: i like cookie
[4:57:25] yaashs: MMMM cookie
[4:57:29] manmower: sounds like a bakery
[4:57:34] almostdps: @Ziddrax didnt they already confirm you can change builds anywhere as long as you are out of combat and not in m+?
[4:57:35] sitmeee: I think it will depend on playstyle and guild exp
[4:57:37] Wolfenhoof: @Ziddrax Thats most likely the case imo.
[4:57:47] Yagr6: im going in blind yolo
[4:57:53] SpoofAvatar: Oatmeal choc chip please
[4:57:55] Gooseberries: How about Template Terror?
[4:58:10] Molvonos: Yea, cookie cutter just doesnt 'cut it' anymore.  They overused the term - like boomer
[4:58:10] Ziddrax: @almostdps i'm not sure, i didnt see
[4:58:16] sitmeee: Im just going to close my eyes and pick talents. its called the blind build
[4:58:22] Snabido: Not even Searing Totem back before? PepeHands
[4:58:27] Literae: bring back that 2min duration with 4 totems LUL
[4:58:31] Wolfenhoof: If they let players change the templates inside raids i think Gooseberries has the right new term with template terror.
[4:58:54] Tankape: yoo @Towelliee have you seen war talents? prot looks dope
[4:58:58] mozavich: i think when people use "cookie cutter" today, they; are referring to builds that aren't unique to the player using it. everyone's using it because it's THE way you have to spec for X, Y, Z bosses.
[4:59:00] andre_scb: doesnt blizzard has a default build for people?
[4:59:06] spicymangobaby: top down talents are old school imo
[4:59:21] almostdps: @andre_scb they said they might include one, but i dont think its in yet
[4:59:21] akia03: can you change loadouts mid dungeon?
[4:59:28] manmower: will you need to use a tome to change spec in raid?
[4:59:35] sitmeee: I dont know what you have against cookies @Towelliee LUL
[4:59:41] Gooseberries: We heard you liked weak auras for every fight now here are templates for every fight - WoWhead
[4:59:42] Inzidious: cannt waiit
[4:59:45] fosko777: do loadouts change the bars?
[4:59:55] Snabido: Now imagine M+, based of on different affix weeks
[5:00:11] thunderhawq: thunderhawq subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Keep it up Dude!
[5:00:13] andre_scb: if they add a default build for aoe/solo would be awsome for new players
[5:00:41] spicymangobaby: @andre_scb the game should link you to wow head
[5:00:43] sitmeee: LUL
[5:00:43] ChaosKunai: LUL
[5:00:47] yaashs: Fury warrior is the best talent tree IMO, so many choises
[5:00:55] alextheblight: LUL
[5:01:01] andre_scb: @andre_scb or that
[5:01:01] Molvonos: Clipped for posterity]
[5:01:07] Molvonos: towSip
[5:01:15] thiccsushi: KEKW
[5:01:24] itsEllySaurus: i know for sure. ill just look up the overall best build. that might not be min maxed AT all. but then never change unless i have to
[5:01:38] Armdel: there's like 10 people on the alpha be happy they queues for dungeons at all
[5:01:44] thunderhawq: I this the customizable blizz UI?
[5:01:55] Koraszdormu: "Bro, your deeps is too big dick.  Can you try sucking a little?"
[5:02:00] Snabido: Perhaps there will be a viable consecration build for a certain fight 😏
[5:02:16] Wolfenhoof: I will boycott this nonsense and just don't spent my points Kappa
[5:02:17] ExpectDragons: saw a video earlier of a private server recreating 2003 Vanilla alpha, be interesting if Blizzard ever released that for Classic content
[5:02:38] ZeroNpcTV: what colour is evoker class bar?
[5:02:42] sshadeh: @itsyacatgirl you are gonna have multiple loadouts, so you can find "best" overall build for raids, m+ etc

[5:03:56] Snabido: Give melee some random weaklings to punch while its in the air
[5:04:01] sshadeh: mage is light blue
[5:04:06] sshadeh: dragon is turqoise
[5:04:19] sshadeh: kinda similar to monk
[5:04:55] solas35: Uldum ??
[5:05:00] Tankape: yeah kinda dark to be turquoise but i guess thats it
[5:05:19] mqhunter: dark monk

[5:13:11] TheRiwen: So no holy powers in DF
[5:13:22] sshadeh: that would be nice
[5:13:28] yaashs: warlock will be interesting
[5:13:44] Quecklain: avengers shield not generating holy power will be fine for easy content since you'll get a larger shield, but once you hit harder content this absorb shield will be useless for single target
[5:13:58] Tankape: I legit havent played paladin for so long because of holy power. I just dislike it so much
[5:14:30] ZeroNpcTV: hopefully ww monk is okay
