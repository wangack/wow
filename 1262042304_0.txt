[2:38:26] tobiassven: You miss shadowmeld, Swifty. Shadowmelding on the bridge - the element of surprise when the enemy knocks on the door
[2:38:40] Enmael00: sytems LUL more like time sink garbage
[2:38:40] NoshTimue: Book of Many Things
[2:38:53] aazzox: does it not get boring to play the same battleground over and over?
[2:39:02] Kohvos: torghast talent system kinda has more options than your own class and that doesnt make any sense
[2:39:25] NoshTimue: i heard theyre stopping Shards of Domination
[2:39:35] og_herni: Gridning R14 isnt about having fun
[2:39:48] marchie17: Is this your last week swifty?
[2:39:56] Gustafadon: Isnt the Torghast system pretty much a time-soak? I dont really think that it benefits the game.
[2:39:58] Enmael00: shard of domination... a literal borrowed power lasting in just 1 tier patch... talk about pathetic
[2:40:09] Charlemagne_66: all the time sinks and systems in retail is what turns me away from it every time
[2:40:12] madmax84: going for R14 on a Night Elf warrior after R14 on Shammy? xD
[2:40:17] exthun_: @NoshTimue yea tierset bonuses instead
[2:40:18] petit_lascar: It's interesting that Blizzard chose a Dun Morogh looking like zone for the biggest BG in WoW
[2:40:24] Foxhound67: u ganna get sulfurus?
[2:40:30] Charlemagne_66: once you get to the last week swifty i think your motivation will go up a ton
[2:40:41] NoshTimue: @Galdhan it gives you soul ash so you can craft a Legendary then you have to gather more to upgrade it
[2:40:58] Enmael00: last week is the HOME STRETCH
[2:41:04] Levictuz: Swifty is a warrior God, what is this shaman poop? Come on swifty, bring back the best warrior in WoW <3
[2:41:22] Charlemagne_66: last week swifty only gets 4 hours of sleep a night to make sure he gets it

[2:42:04] Gustafadon: @NoshTimue Yeah, that's what I mean. Instead of just letting you use legos from the start, like in Legion. There's really no point of having to farm soul ash for your lego, other than "earning" the power.
[2:42:05] oldratgod: Swifty's just at the virtual gym, gotta make up those hours to get what you want. Slow and steady!
[2:42:05] nobody_knows_best: sadly no drop :(
[2:42:17] Tatordots: is new molten core alot harder?
[2:42:29] nicecarcass: I have someone close to me that did rank 14 on a box in vanilla from 2019; just go in and blow up the entire av raid and alliance instantly die
[2:42:30] petit_lascar: That's a nice song
[2:42:35] muzzbug2016: when you hit rank 14 - what will you do after that
[2:42:35] BradTheBabeSlayer: havent seen much of season of mastery gameplay is rag really difficult?

[2:43:50] Astoriel_Erethas: anyone know... are the soloque in retail already here? if not, does anyone know, when they will be here?^^
[2:43:55] Kohvos: distracting dagger from DM-W and muggers belt = +11 daggers, overkill tho to use both
[2:44:02] crodash92: did you guys like Dont Look Up?
[2:44:04] ADawgarian: @Knettertje nice, was thinking of buying an aeropress myself
[2:44:13] petit_lascar: !song

[2:44:24] petit_lascar: What song is this?
[2:44:27] Charlemagne_66: how many meals a day are you eating
[2:44:27] yamifaki: and exactly how oblivious the world is today :D
[2:44:32] nargathronic: One pro with the grind 14 grind is that there is minimal risk of getting covid :)
[2:44:56] CissiStarfish: I loved the movie Dont look up. Funniest movie in years
[2:44:59] bigboumbaby: During my grinding, I sometimes play with my eyes closed, I was so tired and my character didn't move due to fatigue even if there were enemies and I woke up with a start
[2:45:00] ADawgarian: some people think Don't Look up is a satire, but it's actually very realistic
[2:45:07] adjective96: song: Inova - Isolation
[2:45:17] AerithsChaos: i JUST TESTED POSITIVE YESTERDAY.
[2:45:20] Charlemagne_66: but there is huge risk of losing your mind

[2:50:54] ADawgarian: !pretzel
[2:50:57] blombomm: sounds like a really long sleep :d
[2:51:24] psircyen: There’s math done about 15 it’s impossible iirc or nearly impossible if the title even existed
[2:51:40] Enmael00: when they are turtling solution is to summon ice lord
[2:51:42] k3rv1nc: If there was a rank 15 to get a legendary weapon to your pick. Would you do an extra 2-3 weeks?

[2:52:13] thanekrio: wasnt it only in the beta
[2:52:16] Manseh: This music is crazy lol

[3:12:18] fookiebooky: why nature resist over resilence?
[3:12:19] Crimson__Clover: next they will make priests play with priests and mages play with mages and kick rogues out of arenas : DDD

[3:13:14] oldcauliflower: Retail is wonderful as far as cost of life upgrades. Classic is nostalgia based.
[3:13:15] krazybaz: Blizz went really down hill when they merge with activision
[3:13:17] xiIian_: hello swifty, i hope you're having a great day
[3:13:21] khaledx_tv: Hey Swifty is SOM easier to rank than normal Classic ?

[3:15:04] frozenpizza2209: wotlk will have more players than tbc
[3:15:16] oldcauliflower: Are you a prot pally? Neor could switch between specs at a whim. He could have switched between specs and once he did his shields would auto out of CDs.
[3:15:21] Twiello: no
[3:15:22] petraiol: yep
[3:15:24] Nufreos: hobe why wouldnt wotlk be big?
[3:15:25] Dante3731: WotLK has great PvP, definetly gonna be more players than tbc
[3:15:30] magicbeeff: Wotlk = everything 🤩

[3:17:36] oldcauliflower: There are stories in my head of Older stages of Tiff and Augustus.

[3:18:19] dhalism_: Horde turtled this game there was like 10 waiting in horde base to stop our rush lol
[3:18:21] XCT_x: @dhalism_ horde isnt turtling this game lol
[3:18:40] 1socket_eth_thresher: 10 is not a turtle
[3:18:51] Boolegan: how many honour needed to reach 14?
[3:18:52] oldcauliflower: What makes a game is the people who play it. Not its creators.
[3:18:58] XCT_x: @dhalism_ alliance are backcapping lol. so we sent D

[3:19:44] litu9k: @Swifty How do you feel?:)
[3:19:49] oldcauliflower: SHadowbane in my mindwas the best game ever made. Now though it is WoW.
[3:19:49] fabfizz: @oldcauliflower very true, but saying "creators" is very broad, considering the game is run and owned by businessmen, not gamers
[3:20:10] zacharyzorbas: This is the grind of all grinds
[3:20:23] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[3:20:34] dhalism_: @XCT_x Horde literally had 10 waiting at frostwolf keep to stop our rush, they turtled big time
[3:20:38] Boolegan: how many days till hit rank 14?
[3:20:53] oldcauliflower: Fab, that is true. The game is fueled and run by its player base. Swift to have complete control is to be on a private server. I hope you don't do that as it is against ToS.
[3:20:57] Manseh: You got this John
[3:21:02] 1socket_eth_thresher: Is swifty the most likeable streamer of all time. How does he do that?

[3:43:56] ccnn24: yo how does that war go from farming 90k honor to 1m+, crazy
[3:44:02] nasargielcreep: thats why you need to focus on weeks   bg or av week play chilling 5 6 hours only bgs but in AV  burn that

[3:48:30] Zilz1: JUAN V JUAN
[3:48:30] ccnn24: 1v1 will kill all other arenas
[3:48:33] 1socket_eth_thresher: elden ring > lost ark
[3:48:36] ForresterZ: Cause the game isn't balanced towards 1v1
[3:48:42] Araxxia: because most people done pvp maybe ?
[3:48:45] 08bit: 1v1 rogues?
[3:48:45] newkingcody: 1v1 is a nightmare to balance
[3:48:46] 1socket_eth_thresher: yeah 1v1 is too rock paper scissors
[3:48:47] fabfizz: teags don't make Swifty quit wow :'(

[3:49:07] 1socket_eth_thresher: elden ringggggg yes
[3:49:07] Enmael00: A moment of silence for those who quit at Rank 13... Honestly i don't know which is crazier.... Quitting when you are 1 rank to go for rank 14 or continuing this crazy honor grind
[3:49:08] EastCoastPride: rogues would be even more dominant in pvp lol
[3:49:09] MxkeD: just make class specific titles/ladders?
[3:49:10] oldcauliflower: Swifty????
[3:49:10] nasargielcreep: guardian druid vs prot paladin    one hour fight haha
[3:49:10] frozenpizza2209: rogue/mage/druid in classic 1v1
[3:49:19] Turomori: Moving on from WoW is hard. I moved to ff about a year ago but whenever i see a streamer playing retail i get like this homesick feeling in my chest. I love ff but i grew up with wow so it still hurts that i left
[3:49:22] krazybaz: a new game like Dark Soul
[3:49:24] NoshTimue: Duels count as 1v1s
[3:49:28] 1socket_eth_thresher: it's like dark souls meets skyrim
[3:49:36] Knups: its open world dark souls
[3:49:39] djkrae: alright gotta go teagan bye Kappa
[3:49:43] benstiner69her: why cant they just make 1vs1 but only Qs classes togeather
[3:49:47] oldcauliflower: Swifty, I have nothing but respect for you.
[3:49:57] Araxxia: @Swifty  There is a new MMO coming out for VR 17th of this month :D
[3:49:57] nasargielcreep: dark souls 4 open world but with pvp fixed mechanics
[3:50:05] Araxxia: 27th i mean
[3:50:06] fabfizz: @benstiner69her because I wanna splatter mages as a warrior

[3:50:23] Herbsmkr: I fail to understand why rank 14 is a thing. You just sit in BGs, does not prove skill or anything. Is it just for the better gear?
[3:50:31] 1socket_eth_thresher: Teagan is an awesome wow player I got to play with on the AV discord
[3:50:38] oldcauliflower: Another Swifty woman!
[3:50:41] 1socket_eth_thresher: who should totally play elden ring
[3:50:41] Turomori: @Araxxia a VR mmo? this sounds wacky, whats the name?
[3:50:50] fabfizz: @mrkanev its also a sign of commitment and dedication
[3:51:05] Rastolor: Teagans the big bad Druid

[3:51:19] Enmael00: LIES>. augmented virtual reality is the future
[3:51:39] Araxxia: @Turomori  Its called Zenith last city o believe

[3:52:17] nasargielcreep: you can pvp during boss fight  on elden ring   inside the boss room  thats is amazing  the boss can attack each other teams

[3:52:30] 1socket_eth_thresher: comes out feb 22 I think
[3:52:32] thatcheese: if you show gear and spec I will gift/sub

[3:53:25] oldcauliflower: Thatchees makes me think of my woman the Spanish Teacher who I love on my big tv.
[3:53:39] fabfizz: League mmo will be massive, but it probably tie in with the release of season 2 of arcane
[3:53:51] fabfizz: @zilz1 elden ring
[3:54:22] 1socket_eth_thresher: Lost Ark is like diablo 3 to me
[3:54:41] oldcauliflower: She isn't English, but Spanish that most agregious? Nope, she is very contageous to me.
[3:54:45] Herbsmkr: @fabfizz well, I could understand that but if its not fun and it is in no way a showcase of skill, it kinda makes zero sense to me :D
[3:54:56] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Smooth by Afilion -> https://prtzl.io/2AH7LODZgwEDkwck

[3:55:06] oldcauliflower: Catches me on fire, so I can then stand or sit beside it and warm myself
[3:55:17] 1socket_eth_thresher: they're  avoiding pay to win for the west
[3:55:22] fabfizz: @mrkanev yeah it's not really, but very very few people have done it, so it's pretty cool
[3:55:22] anticensor_: I dont like how asian games look not appealing to me

[3:56:22] anticensor_: Ashes of creation is to pay to play its gonna go badly
[3:56:30] 1socket_eth_thresher: they need an AV style of play in new world
[3:56:43] moppis_world: @Forrester_Z Sure

[3:57:44] 1socket_eth_thresher: I'm optimistic about ashes of creation but there are theories it's never coming out
[3:57:47] krazybaz: no pay to play is that you have to buy the game

[3:58:13] xoof: that's still pay to play though
[3:58:35] 7thSaga: i see Xaryu playing New World alot and hes pretty good he earns gold by dueling alot LUL classic josh
[3:58:37] oldcauliflower: I have hurt this game in my lobbying. I apologize to all of you.
[3:58:37] PrioryOrion: Hello sir. :)
[3:58:37] ForresterZ: Rather pay a sub than have a ingame store filled with pay to win features
[3:58:44] fabfizz: @mrkanev from what I remember, yes
[3:58:45] Araxxia: Swtor is subscription if you want but can play for free also
[3:58:47] AerithsChaos: That makes it pay to win
[3:58:50] xoof: even if it's a 1 off expense, it's still pay to play. Unless you pay (once) , you don't get to play
[3:59:02] oldcauliflower: It was simply my desire to overcome my handicap.
[3:59:02] anticensor_: battlepass based on accomplishments is future of MMO monetization
[3:59:05] 1socket_eth_thresher: RIFT was the closest to being as good as WoW
[3:59:11] dresden2121: Ff14 and wow do fine as pay to play
[3:59:15] 1socket_eth_thresher: I miss RIFT
[3:59:20] oldcauliflower: My handicap I realize is myself. I apologize.
[3:59:20] krazybaz: like SWTOR
[3:59:20] CrusaderNero: like ESO does
[3:59:28] Tommy3k: when a mmo goes f2p, it usually dies. unless its carried only by cosmetics or quality of life features. but that usually is detrimental to the cosmetic items found in the game, and features are made tedious to make people buy the QoL features.
[3:59:28] AerithsChaos: Sounds like p2w to me

[4:00:05] fabfizz: @xoof i don't think that's what pay to play means, the standard is to buy and game and play it. pay to play is you need to keep paying to keep playing
[4:00:13] 1socket_eth_thresher: cross server premades gonna be tried. A new discord
[4:00:19] paygator: take out note pad ✏️
[4:00:34] DovahChicken: Yooooo swifty!  how is it going?
[4:00:53] 7thSaga: guzuNotes
[4:01:01] xoof: @fabfizz I disagree. It's either Free to play (like league of legends) or Pay to Play. Different types of P2P but still P2P
[4:01:07] 1socket_eth_thresher: When's Teagan coming back
[4:01:09] oldcauliflower: Pay to play is a monthly sub. Pay to win is the fact that you pay for greater advantage over someone who can't afford to pay to win.
[4:01:15] dresden2121: F2p normally  has hidden costs to progress
[4:01:29] DovahChicken: i have not tushed pvp so far, is it worth trying? @Swifty  im playing swiftyALLIANCE
[4:01:36] Teagens: @tals_stapler I quit WoW for the time being. Not going back anytime soon. I need some time to rest and recover.

[4:04:19] dresden2121: Flying mounts killed wow anyway
[4:04:32] fabfizz: @xoof agree to disagree then. Since games existed you've had to buy them, that's just the standard. Pw

[4:08:16] goldensteen: more then that on a daily /weekly basis is draining
[4:08:17] fabfizz: @goldensteen i don't think you can tell people what they can and can't do
[4:08:41] yamifaki: @fabfizz unless you da government
[4:08:42] xebrios: Lost ark is also not a new MMO its been out for a long time and already figured out/meta established. New world was fun because it was new.

[4:10:14] Enmael00: 150 is the minimum to unlock bracket 14 right?
[4:10:32] dhalism_: If thats the case you need to do a pool party to increase the pool size
[4:10:49] goldensteen: @teagens do you know how much honor is bracket 10 atm ?
[4:10:56] fabfizz: @goldensteen you said "you should relax a bit" that's not an opinion, an opinion would be "I think you should"
[4:11:15] 1socket_eth_thresher: the original one with Tylee was pretty cool besides the toxic people
[4:11:19] oldcauliflower: I used to love to play WoW the way I love to play wow and the way I play wow isn't how others play wow. I play wow the way I have fun! I found my own niche in WoW.

[4:14:48] 1socket_eth_thresher: didn't have to play all day, just when games were going. Got to know the schedule.
[4:14:50] oldcauliflower: Yall taught me a good lesson. Refresh my screen!

[4:15:14] goldensteen: then 2nd time only 38k .. its much harder when more people ranking
[4:15:30] 1socket_eth_thresher: pugging rank 14 is the only way to go!
[4:15:38] sawyermcgraw27: True gamer
[4:15:39] oldcauliflower: I would play all day long and never get anything I wanted. Almost as if I was black balled

[4:18:46] fabfizz: alliance playing like babies? nooo LUL Kappa
[4:18:47] Enmael00: Nope.. you can't get rank 14  in 1 go... maximum RP you can get on classic at rank 13 is 33%... since its doubled in SOM so its 66% at bracket 14
[4:18:52] oldcauliflower: My fun isn't in accumulating gear for gears sake. I write back stories for all of my characters. But I started writing a love story between Tiff and Augustus and then I thought, why not make a Neorionsbelt guy and call him Neor just for drama.
[4:19:08] 1socket_eth_thresher: Yeah we should class and put them in their place

[4:20:03] baentam68: thats what alliance did for 2 years straight
[4:20:12] baentam68: we were so happy to get some lts horde always won

[4:23:07] benlione: is her microphone on the other side of the room
[4:23:14] Crimson__Clover: the solution is pretty simple for that make winning a game give 100.000 points per game and make rank 14 billion points... that will make getting individual honor kills worthless to grind....
[4:23:27] Teagens: @benlione He has me on speaker phone on his mobile
[4:23:30] oldcauliflower: I was thinking about TeaGun is actually a cool name. I love Tea and being a Gun is cool too lol

[6:06:19] 00bluesector: for me it was mostly because of the raid frame that was too big

[6:08:05] nubs_games: The cheap printers also take the smallest, most expensive cartridges which is even worse!
[6:08:16] EvoCyberNation: HP is helping people fix their printer heads now. The printer heads were going bad too fast. :)
[6:08:31] drac84: more so with ink cartridges, yea. New printers come with low capacity cartridges tho

[6:10:16] EvoCyberNation: Companies keep using covid as an excuse to raise prices  :(  Some companies, I understand.
[6:10:17] TheLemonFizz: I don’t get how ranks work. And will you drop rank?
[6:10:39] 00bluesector: HP also offers  subscription for ink. The printer will automatically send out a request to HP and they will ship you ink
[6:10:46] THUNDERTIGERDK: 50 for a printer is normal price these days
[6:10:49] RafikiOnBass: i worked in the trucking industry, nobody wants to work in it anymore, they dont pay enough + covid mandates

[6:19:16] HealEarth: @swifty When you reach Rank 14, does it lock you into that rank if you stop pvping for a while?
