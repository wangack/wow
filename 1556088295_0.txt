[0:47:11] nvnto: Think people are just looking for experience/rio for 18+. Dont think it's related to ilvl.
[0:47:13] 91Niki: @Pozzeno Just start playing, take it at your own pace and have fun! Not much else to say honestly

[0:49:32] Masqerader: I can't wait till tomorrow, grim rail with sanguine and grievous will be fun
[0:50:15] 91Niki: @Pozzeno You can wait until pre patch if you want. Whether you choose to boost or level from start. It isn't a must to jump in now. If you start now you have longer to gear a bit before DF to help with the leveling process. Boosted toons gear is pretty crappy

[0:51:16] spookychefkarolina: Idk it didn’t go very well for red bulls and four lokos lol
[0:51:27] 91Niki: @Pozzeno I believe pre patch usually happens 3-4 weeks before exp drop. So depending on how many hours you have to play each day, that's the time you have to level to max if you don't boost.

[0:54:15] Molvonos: @Molvonos You'd think so, but if you're not able to bring  some kind of utlity (lust/shroud/etc), you get overlooked.  Been that way all expac -  I still get KSM/AOTC, but shit's annoying

[1:31:31] Sadisticmedic: some people wipe then they bail on the tank. My first dungeon tanking
[1:32:04] looney199725: in bfa we used do 5 man tanks for m+

[3:03:20] GoblinSniper55: i use steelseries
[3:03:23] StarbuckTech: you are rough on mice

[3:03:34] RolexKT: Only time I owned a corsair it broke within 8 months, all my razer products lasted years
[3:03:40] Mister_Ript: And the only thing that broke on the first mouse was the mouse-wheel-click stopped working.  And, that was my cleanse button lol
[3:03:43] Nebulizer87: had a string of bad luck with Logitech Headsets, and Razer Nagas I go through like crazy
[3:03:46] DiiscoViking: they all china made

[3:03:59] Kakotan2143: None of mine break and i use them for hours every day for work and gaming so i thought they were a good brand, Now Razer has broken for me lol
[3:04:24] Demanisraar: Trinity

[3:06:32] sqknarf: ive had my razer keyboard for about 6 years or so, works like a charm still buttons fading but not that important, ive had two mice in that same span of time
[3:06:38] A_Klimas: that's why i always use bestbuy protection plan for peripherals cause they just give you a new one
[3:06:41] Kakotan2143: @A_Cold_0ne maybe the newer stuff is not made as good, with all of them not just Naga but other types
