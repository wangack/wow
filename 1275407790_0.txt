[0:28:08] Phantomstrk: Then i will go out on a limb and guess 9.2, with it launching either last tuesday in Feb or first tuesday in march.   Definately not 10.0, because that expac won't be before june next year at earliest

[1:34:49] KingSlayerYotam: @KingSlayerYotam I imagine r io doesnt track every char, but someone who tries to do mythic + will update his score, so even if it doesn't track everyone its a really low % of the overall population
[1:34:52] Thoreya: people seething that 9.2 is gonna be good LUL LUL

[1:37:13] gidgeet: lol
[1:37:14] Selzyr: @mikejames01 promises, I believe when I see it, the game needs quite a lot before its even considered "good" anymore, they need to put back the RPG onto the mmorpg of WoW, they need to improve even more on costumization in general, and fix the darn story/lore and stop creating soap operas that crap on old "decent" written lore.
[1:37:14] luckfore: KEKW
[1:37:14] Zip13: It’s so odd how they don’t have the next week’s events start right when the old stuff from last week is gone.

[3:04:38] johniiv: Working in mobile games myself I think that having WoW mobile would be contradictory from Diablo Immortal since it would be both MMO on mobile. What I'm sure they working on is a Warcraft Hero collector game like Strike Force or Summoners War type. That would be very popular
[3:04:43] Alepouditsa: @LosDuervo yep ppl say the new's  will be about immortal

[3:19:29] Brannax: @cakeabsorber Honestly, I think the Princess Principal game is that. Theres a tonne of anime mobile games that have weird gameplay systems.
[3:19:33] raiwist: can't exactly have a computer in the bathroom
[3:19:33] joe_g_433: I don’t want to sound like a doomed but the Wow mobile prospect is kind of tainted to me, due to the content drought in main game. Selfishly I just want 9.2 already lol.

[3:38:46] swordart_19: towHi
[3:39:04] grandmatb: Personally... if 10.0 DROPPED LFR (legit just use party finder if youre casual and want to raid) and decrease the ilvl jump between tiers so the last raid isnt irrelevant next patch. instant success. wrong?
[3:39:18] grandmatb: if one of the two jsut do the ilvl thing
[3:39:24] Deathtracker: @Towelliee  when are we going to get the BLIZZ NEWS ?
[3:39:25] FreshieFresh: I am so behind in retail and everything I need to do to catch up is a huge turn off...guess I am waiting for the next xpac

[3:40:08] feelu_: same
[3:40:15] tomcruise210: is vengeance dh not good in 9.2?
[3:40:33] swordart_19: @freshiefresh you are behind 18 year almost since game released
[3:40:38] tomcruise210: lol
[3:40:39] grandmatb: @towelliee Personally... if 10.0 DROPPED LFR (legit just use party finder if youre casual and want to raid) and decrease the ilvl jump between tiers so the last raid isnt irrelevant next patch. instant success. wrong?
[3:40:43] Draco_wolfstein: what about a bear tank
[3:40:45] duffluv22: test
[3:40:47] xrandomdoodx: @towelliiee did you decide to come back to mythic prog raiding for 9.2?
[3:40:48] jaacobjames: vengeance does not die in 9.2 its wild
[3:40:51] bartholimu: RareParrot
[3:40:53] jerexify: Good morning @towelliee ! Spending my 34th watching the best streamer on Twitch!

[3:41:09] its_bean92: @grandmatb LFR was literally made for casuals to raid, removing it would not help them
[3:41:10] tomcruise210: lfr can be fun tho lol
[3:41:25] azzurrin: lfr should be story mode
[3:41:26] Korupcija_: I don't like how raids are queuable, it's more epic going there

[3:41:42] FreshieFresh: @swordart_19 what?  I stopped in 9.0.  Only one legendary and didn't raid at all.  Better to just wait for the xpac even if I want to play.  I'll just keep to classic for now.
[3:41:45] toxsinqt: get rid of one difficulty that serves no purpose
[3:41:46] swordart_19: @itsbeantv I am casual and I don't do lfr.beimg bad doesn't= lfr.

[3:42:16] swordart_19: @freshiefresh so you don't play wow at all
[3:42:17] officialviz: Tear you up Kre
[3:42:17] balanira: then just delete normal and rename heroic/mythic into normal/heroic
[3:42:18] my_feethurt: We just started clearing for % if you want in
[3:42:35] audderd: That’s why I don’t do lfr anymore LUL
[3:42:36] swordart_19: @freshiefresh You show up on release boucm repeats every release.
[3:42:40] Alegnowar: also lfr gear is virtually useless, like open world stuff is better than that, sound so pointless to even have loot there
[3:42:43] Deathtracker: I would be fine with normal being the new LFR
[3:42:49] FreshieFresh: @swordart_19 I play TBC classic and that's just to level alts I want for wotlk
[3:42:49] Sogybritches: tear me up should be taco Bell's new slogan
[3:42:56] tomcruise210: man i miss blood dps like in wrath
[3:43:10] swordart_19: @freshiefresh not single mmorpg is neither will be for people like you.
[3:43:18] FreshieFresh: @swordart_19 pretty much.  Been that way since BFA.  Legion was the last time I played all the time.
[3:43:22] eustacebags: Is it confirmed that there’s some sort of news today? Like a press conference or what?
[3:43:35] swordart_19: @freshiefresh so you don't even play current tbc KEKW yo weirdo

[3:44:03] FreshieFresh: @swordart_19 my dude lol...why you gatekeeping mmorpgs?  They can be for anyone.  PogO af dude
[3:44:08] grandmatb: 4 difficulites makes ilvl jumps too much imo. and dropping LFR making people que for Normal through premades jsut makes sense. lessen the ilvl jump between difficulties and tiers so raids dont become irrelevant next patch @Towelliee
[3:44:13] inj0shwetrust: if you feel like doing keys on your dk I can come help dps some 15s
[3:44:23] Alegnowar: dk whit shit gear is unplayable
[3:44:30] joe_g_433: You going to stream that sanctum run?
[3:44:31] motorboatingpro: I feel like its far easier to stack a M+ group for initial gearing.
[3:44:31] balanira: the self healing part is so satisfying
[3:44:33] tomcruise210: @FreshieFresh how is he gatekeeping??? he asked a question
[3:44:36] swordart_19: @freshiefresh go play mobile games seems like something for you or anything without progression weirdo
[3:44:45] KnsWoW: are you streaming it?
[3:44:55] JStevenson: isnt there decent gear from the new zone thats boa for catch up?
[3:45:00] Heero_Effect: DPS DK is fun 🤩
[3:45:19] grandmatb: @Baleroc1 youre kidding right? so why have lfr and normal if its the same gear?
[3:45:23] realnzall: @Towelliee Define shit gear? Every time I hear someone use that term, they're saying that everything below mythic gear is shit gear
[3:45:26] FreshieFresh: @swordart_19 oof...my dude.  You need to stop thinking you're some elite gamer and everyone has to play like you.  That's really weird.
[3:45:29] Djulio: which day do you think the announcement will hit?
[3:45:34] grandmatb: @Baleroc1 people can just que normal in premades... its the same thing
[3:45:38] CAPT_Crack: @heero_effect and bad :(
[3:45:52] Maydie6066: towCringe 184
[3:45:52] grandmatb: @Baleroc1 im sorry.. im never a dick to someones opinion... but thats just wrong lol.
[3:46:01] DiiscoViking: lol im 150 soooo low
[3:46:05] Eggz1004: 195 is heroic dungeon ilvl isnt it? @Towelliee
[3:46:13] swordart_19: @freshiefresh you need to play non progression games bye clown
[3:46:21] Korupcija_: I remember when people got KSM with 180 ilvl at start of shadowlands, insane
[3:46:23] Maydie6066: @Eggz1004 200 is the AH ilvl lol
[3:46:30] Heero_Effect: @capt_crack truth….it needs work!
[3:46:30] EthicalHermit: 150 isnt even playing the game
[3:46:30] lightsflux: its hard to keep more than like 3 or 4 toons geared or at least for me
[3:46:40] grandmatb: @Baleroc1 so you want the harder normal difficulty to drop same gear as the easier lfr difficulty?
[3:46:40] TakeThatBack: I boosted then bought the 200 crafted gear im at 210
[3:46:42] balanira: heirloom gear scale to 150 LUL
[3:46:43] DiiscoViking: hit 60 couple weeks ago, very casual
[3:46:45] FreshieFresh: @swordart_19 so mad cause he met a casual gamer lol
[3:46:56] NickLeonhearth: i got a hunter to 180 for 10k from the AH

[3:47:10] thenormalbeast: No Warrior prot?
[3:47:12] Gingerprimer: Yeah esp with the reduction of loot drops in m+ from 3 to 2
[3:47:16] swordart_19: @wrighty_93 I am one saying facts if you have issues with progression play games without it.
[3:47:23] tomcruise210: prot warrior KEKW

[3:51:08] ardimwow: really removing a difficulty would really benefit itemization
[3:51:15] kuiper_ow: @Towelliee are you working on blanchy mount?
[3:51:16] WATWOOD: thats true
[3:51:17] Yagr6: it would free up some time as well for blizzard to not worry about lfr
[3:51:22] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: they legit should just make normal queueable like LFR 3 difficulties instead of 4
[3:51:22] MaleFrom73: what about the determination stacks?
[3:51:28] tomcruise210: tauren are such chads
[3:51:34] cahoots82: determination
[3:51:34] Maydie6066: honestly LFR is only "hard" because like 90% of people go in with a "eh its LFR time to AFK"
[3:51:35] spiked16: only the health i think
[3:51:45] shabobado: Keep determination or no?
[3:51:53] luckfore: so basically it becomes lfr
[3:51:58] atmfees: it depends on the fights....tarrigrue lfr does not need to exist, while sylvannis lfr is too hard for lots of (bad) players i've seen
[3:52:00] valianya: no added lfr pug difficulty
[3:52:06] PlayGamesMore: LFR denathrius vs Normal Denathrius
[3:52:06] MexicanMisker: @Towelliee only problem is that LFR-playing forums casuals will throw a temper tantrum or fit if u remove LFR
[3:52:06] Jarlan23: lfr players are basically there to see the story only and thats it. they kinda dont pay attention to fights or anything
[3:52:07] ardimwow: pug raid leading altimor was definitely easier on normal than on LFR lol
[3:52:17] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: only good part about keeping LFR is the armor set tints but tbh that could be moved to some valor stuff or some outdoor content tbh
[3:52:24] AlphasaurusRexx: if you queue for it, then you get determination stacks. if you premade, then no determination stacks. easy coding for blizzard
[3:52:24] IianaDRK: the game needs to just have LFR for story > heroic > mythic. the game doesnt need normal mode anymore
[3:52:26] Jokervenom1978: WAY different
[3:52:27] Collected1: Jarlan23 : disagree. i LFR because i want to raid but can't commit to a raiding guild etc.
[3:52:35] Snabido: 1 difficulty that caters to every1? Easy 30 min clear of a new raid Kappa
[3:52:38] EthicalHermit: LFR is more difficult because it has a min iLvl to join, so people join with that. Normal isn't queable, so people always take the highest iLvl
[3:52:44] Hesh3: !YT
[3:52:44] Alegnowar: every time somemene bring up lfr ppl have to act so toxic for no reason
[3:52:45] grandmatb: @Collected1 so you que for a premade normal... same thing
[3:52:45] Moobot: @Hesh3 Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Ranking EVERY World Of Warcraft Expansion - WoW Tier List youtu.be/CLrPHWHnfEw
[3:52:49] WATWOOD: get rid of lfr and keep raiding hard. Normies just stay out of it
[3:53:01] Sharxkin: all bosses in lfr should be tank n spank no mechanics
[3:53:16] Korupcija_: hahah so true
[3:53:19] lalelusa: can't you just teleoprt over there from where Venari is? Once you've got the upgrade on your main, you'Ve got it on all you alts
[3:53:23] Jokervenom1978: As a person whose guild starts out on normal its very different for me.
[3:53:26] TakeThatBack: so do the SWTOR
[3:53:26] IianaDRK: agreed
[3:53:29] Jarlan23: if anything they should get rid of heroic. keep lfr as it is, make normal slightly harder, and then theres mythic
[3:53:30] Tripzdh: TRUE
[3:53:30] kokochris: 100%
[3:53:33] officialviz: I agree, story heroic mythic
[3:53:36] ArericCirera: i like calling it story mode

[4:16:50] mavericks312: ion is legit a good dude just doing his job
[4:16:50] kevvlish_: probably 5, yup
[4:16:50] Alegnowar: ion hasn'r t logged in his shaman for 5 months, must be hiding in a cave
[4:17:02] Brodih_: you can only pitty these people because they must have a sad life
[4:17:03] TheHardcorian: It's because Ion shrunk Janias taatas
[4:17:09] Heero_Effect: Ion is fine
[4:17:10] QMGSaint: Acting like Ion slapped their mom

[4:17:34] TheCliffyShow: Their class was nerfed so now they have a seething hatred for Ion.
[4:17:41] 91Niki: Only reason why people hate Ion is because he's been on all those interviews with Lore and others. He's become the face of the game. So if you think the game is shit, who will you hate? Obviously the "face" of the game @Towelliee
[4:17:50] tomcruise210: maybe he goes back to being raid lead

[4:18:09] Danestasia: I would love that

[4:18:13] havenbirch: Man I'd love to have Tom Chilton back

[4:44:40] smashwow: etc etc
[4:44:44] Milanesa_De_Pollo: how many characters is Towelliee farming Nalak with?
[4:44:45] Nevik69: A different version of wow specifically for xbox can work just not cross platform
[4:44:49] osatox: if they make it to console, they can just have a network option to play with cross-platform if opting in for it, can't use the "nobody invites me because of controller"
[4:44:53] tomcruise210: KEKW
[4:44:55] theDirtyon3: ESO didnt allow add on on the console version of the game for years and they were pretty much considered second class citizens lol
[4:45:01] mikejames01: ESO is not wow ..wow has more stuff
[4:45:01] Yagr6: wow 2 designed for controller PogChamp
[4:45:04] CrunkyBrewster: 12 actually, if you count Weapon Swapping Kappa
[4:45:07] Ferocani: controller is not an issue, xbox supports mouse and keyboard
[4:45:08] Snabido: vs wow's 50+ depending on macros
[4:45:09] cannibalcanyon: LMAO
[4:45:12] claud_strife12: they could just sell special keyboards for wow on xbox with xbox brand
[4:45:13] TheCliffyShow: Also, a console version of ESO was in the works since the beginning. It just got delayed.
[4:45:16] swordart_19: amount of buttons does not matter seen people doing arenas in high rating with controller
[4:45:20] CullenPrime: FF XIV has as many buttons as WoW does
[4:45:21] CrunkyBrewster: NOPE
[4:45:24] piratechris: No way
[4:45:24] FreshieFresh: absolutely not
[4:45:24] dozilla: Xbox allows Mouse and Keyboard = done
[4:45:25] clammyhandzz: bethesda is really good with mods and addons and they own them too
[4:45:25] tomcruise210: nah i want it on steamdeck
[4:45:26] Fray24_: hell nah lol
[4:45:27] emarol_dk: Noooo
[4:45:33] chavodk: no one will play wow on console or mobile
[4:45:33] Capo367: Its not about switching, its about opening to a different group of gamers
[4:45:34] TheManlyWay: isn't FFXIV in console?
[4:45:35] claud_strife12: just made it so you need to plug in keyboard and mouse
[4:45:35] CullenPrime: I would play WoW on console so I must be crazy
[4:45:37] mavericks312: @dozilla but no addons
[4:45:39] MetalJoshP: wow has to much components for console
[4:45:41] z01z: they just need to allow keyboard and mouse on console,
[4:45:43] piratechris: I can play on my 70 inch tv with nvidia shield and keyboard and mouse. I'm good thx
[4:45:44] austin_114: I'd stay on pc
[4:45:44] subversv: i dont like console gaming in general
[4:45:49] claud_strife12: just made it so you need to plug in keyboard and mouse easy
[4:45:50] SilkeySmooth: microsoft doesnt care about 17 year old wow...lol
[4:45:56] tomcruise210: @TheManlyWay was designed for consoles
[4:45:58] mikejames01: I would not invite a console player to my raid or mythic plus
[4:45:58] Alegnowar: @Towelliee u said earlier Tom Chilton is gonna rejoin the wow team soon, did he still workead at blizz in the last few years? other projects maybe?
[4:45:59] luckfore: nah wow is 64bit only now :D
[4:46:04] swordart_19: does not have to
[4:46:08] swordart_19: mac exist
[4:46:08] smokingcactus: People already play wow with controllers
[4:46:09] TheCliffyShow: I'm a console kid at heart, but I wouldn't play WoW on a console.
[4:46:21] theDirtyon3: ITS NOT ABOUT K&B its about ADD ONS CHAT
[4:46:22] dabears5192: @SilkeySmooth sure, a game that brings in billions of dollars per year, microsoft doesn't care sadge
[4:46:27] akaari5486: what blizz news you're talking a bout
[4:46:30] claud_strife12: wait tom chilton is still at blizzard?
[4:46:30] mavericks312: tell a raiding guild you use a controller and see how fast you dont  get invited
[4:46:30] IianaDRK: i hope not. tom was an awful director
[4:46:33] CullenPrime: Here's the thing though it could still be on PC and you can draw in new customers for the console version
[4:46:33] smokingcactus: who plays with addons?
[4:46:34] dozilla: @mavericks312 No reason MS can't pre-approve popular addons? I don't know, seems like it can happen
[4:46:36] ventu105: Love you all
[4:46:39] joe_g_433: What is this great obsession with wow on console. I don’t get it. You can get a gaming pc for the price of a PS5 that would run wow just fine.
[4:46:39] Technonono: With Microsoft in charge you are going to need a computer every year to play wow
[4:46:39] tomcruise210: us wow players and our damn addons
[4:46:42] Ferocani: I would play wow on a console, I would use it to farm and try to get the mounts
[4:46:45] 00joseph: Damn I feel sad the dream is crushed for the Xbox for wow
[4:46:46] Snabido: These nalak spawns tho
[4:46:49] garydeanneal3: If ffxiv and eso don’t suck. Why would wow suck on console.
[4:46:59] osatox: @mavericks312 there are ppl who play with gamepads/controllers who can outdps/outheal/survive better than KB/M players, so not a valid argument
[4:46:59] Havoc_S1: All they have to do with console is make mnk only
[4:47:01] TheManlyWay: @TheManlyWay but it works, that my point, with proper work and optimization I think WoW can be played on console (not saying I will but there's a market for it for sure)
[4:47:02] Ferocani: then jump to PC if I am going to raid/pvp
[4:47:06] RhadigarTV: Morning @Towelliee and chat
[4:47:06] duffluv22: What are your thoughts on WoW with Unreal Engine? Not good?
[4:47:15] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee Threads of fate should work with chromie time so you can level 1-60 in Old zones and not only 1-50
[4:47:21] Fray24_: I can already see console players complaining they can't raid at a high level because guilds won't want players without access to the same tools
[4:47:25] inj0shwetrust: Dude comp stomp as a WW monk is the of the most fun things ive ever done
[4:47:25] swordart_19: i would get controller for it :P
[4:47:27] cahoots82: They think it will bring in more people.
[4:47:27] codedizle: xiv was built for console tho that game is just different you cant compare the two games imo the experience is completely different
[4:47:28] tomcruise210: @garydeanneal3 wow has always been a pc game, elder scrolls and FF are console games
[4:47:29] claud_strife12: it will be good for the game . the console market is massive
[4:47:31] cipusanx: same with swtor
[4:47:34] Trawkey: i wouldnt even play wow on a pc right now
[4:47:34] theDirtyon3: WoW will never in unreal engine either
[4:47:34] Alegnowar: i've heard console peeps would love to play wow on console
[4:47:35] Archiee: some people just want to watch the world burn
[4:47:36] claud_strife12: it will be good for the game . the console market is massive you dont get it
[4:47:43] CrunkyBrewster: its like ppl who want to see Doom played a Toaster
[4:47:45] TheCliffyShow: Sounds like a horrible idea that would lose a lot of money.
[4:47:46] SilkeySmooth: microsoft wants blizzards mobile games thats why they bought blizzard
[4:47:46] theDirtyon3: its has its own game engine
[4:47:47] NinjaGlovz: Lol console
[4:47:48] Short_Film: WoW in VR PogChamp
[4:47:52] Ferocani: Wow needs more players. period
[4:47:52] theDirtyon3: HAHAHA
[4:47:57] idenkaz_: what
[4:47:59] mikejames01: ESO started on PC before console
[4:48:02] Duffadin: I would only ever Farm herbs and Ore laid in bed on a console version
[4:48:02] ventu105: lol
[4:48:06] tomcruise210: its easy for eso to do it cuz all their games were made for consoles
[4:48:09] tomcruise210: same with FF
[4:48:10] Alegnowar: only double LUL
[4:48:15] garydeanneal3: @tomcruise210 how is ffxiv a console game. And eso started on PC

[4:48:17] thetorque162: thetorque162 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:48:17] stylos09: was there a source that says wow might be on console? whats up with this conversation
[4:48:18] warrior_nick23: Ehhh it would be nice to see it on a console because it would be good for the game due to more people checking it out
[4:48:24] mavericks312: WoW was not made for consoles stop it
[4:48:29] Avaciin: this conversation is pointless
[4:48:33] griffdog125: ya'll need to go troll somewhere else.
[4:48:35] cahoots82: Stahp it.
[4:48:35] handlebarswow: people would ONLY play if the subscription was part of gamepass, and even then... ehhh
[4:48:44] TheManlyWay: in the end you can add a keyboard and mouse to a console right? and with the GPU shortage is a good option
[4:48:52] ironforge_1337: is Microsoft gonna make World of Starcraft?
[4:48:55] officialviz: Have a drink towelliee
[4:48:58] CullenPrime: Here's the thing though @Towelliee it could still be on PC and you can draw in new customers for the console version
[4:49:08] Snabido: Just give them a trial only version of wow, maybe that'll entice them to come to PC 😏
[4:49:09] ElakPato: Huge banwave on TBC Arena players XD
[4:49:13] garydeanneal3: I mean ffxiv has a lot of buttons and it works fine on console.
[4:49:14] souleymaster: Lol WoW coming to XBOX game pass
[4:49:16] claud_strife12: just force people to plug in mouse and keyboard onto xbox . make the xbox a pc
[4:49:17] tomcruise210: @garydeanneal3 FFXIV was made for console wym its a known fact lol
[4:49:21] officialviz: Nono I redeemed drink water
[4:49:22] QMGSaint: I honestly think having FFXIV on console holds it back.
[4:49:24] grapyz: A B Y X RT LT is not enough buttons to play wow
[4:49:25] Douchecakes: Make it it's own server
[4:49:28] grandmatb: good for u!
[4:49:30] QMGSaint: I don't want the same for WoW
[4:49:31] vadder_fister: why tho
[4:49:32] codedizle: unless WoW completely changed as a game more similar to ffxiv as in raids and stuff console version would be shit
[4:49:32] TheNightrider: good for you man
[4:49:33] Nyytro84: ff14 works fine on console
[4:49:38] Spoopyfoop: or maybe they can implement these addon's into the console version?
[4:49:39] IianaDRK: u stopped drinking? my dude thats awesome
[4:49:39] TheCliffyShow: @ironforge_1337 I was dead set on Titan being World of Starcraft until it was revealed Overwatch came from the left overs of Titan.
[4:49:41] cannibalcanyon: not only would it be a shitty experience but you’d be paying for online services and a wow sub..
[4:49:41] Havoc_S1: All they have to do is make it mouse and keyboard only no controllers.
[4:49:43] DiiscoViking: GJ drinking is overrated
[4:49:45] cptrogers123: Man i craving soda so bad...
[4:49:49] theDirtyon3: omg these takes in chat today wtf is this shit? KEKW
[4:49:51] tallee1: Also good luck with addons like dbm and ui ones on console
[4:49:54] Ferocani: Xbox its almost ready a PC, it supports mouse and keyboard, just need to support addons and thats it
[4:50:03] killawatts75: Drinking sucks smoke a bowl
[4:50:04] mikejames01: stops USE ff14 that is different FF 14 has no adds ons
[4:50:04] CullenPrime: But even if it couldn't work they could always do WoW 2 and design it for console.
[4:50:07] mytherel: I live in Wisconsin, not drinking means only a couple
[4:50:13] claud_strife12: xbox supports mouse and keyboard
[4:50:14] BitsyOD: Method to get wow on console could be to allow mouse and keyboard support some of xbox games already have mouse and keyboard support
[4:50:17] Templexx: yea that tolerence reset
[4:50:25] garydeanneal3: @tomcruise210 real reborn was not made for console. Original ffxiv vs current ffxiv is a different games and it still works
[4:50:34] codedizle: @cullenprime that would be the only way imo to do it now would be a complete redesign
[4:50:43] oTeeZe: thats good, let the liver heal! breaks are nice
[4:50:50] Dinosew: I could go for a Modelo Chelada
[4:50:51] Qelvue: I drink like once a year

[4:51:25] killawatts75: Wow console let’s take away more resources from the WoW dev team to now put on Xbox only
[4:51:26] inj0shwetrust: I know more xbox players on mouse n keyboard than controller now a days
[4:51:31] kfire2kenbob: Microsoft just buys overwolf instead
[4:51:32] handlebarswow: @mikejames01 yes it does, don't lie to yourself lol.. but it's not to WoW level
[4:51:38] TheCliffyShow: It's an example of people asking for something without really thinking it through.
[4:51:40] tomcruise210: @garydeanneal3 doesnt mean wow will lol

[5:44:38] raiwist: is it an mmo? PogChamp
[5:44:50] xxcujozxx: quik saying played it/playable > ashes of creation coming in 2077
[5:44:50] Velashen: I'd like a real announcement with a date. Not an announcement that they are working on something. We already knew that lol
[5:44:53] tebbix: that's cute, give me more WoW
[5:44:54] Vivelli: its got the bones to be greenlit which is a good sign
[5:44:56] Ferrolune: it's minecraft KEKW

[5:45:08] jaina8675309: new mount
[5:45:09] Imprexive: i like how mike left xbox and is coming back to xbox
[5:45:10] CrunkyBrewster: We had the alpha for Everquest Next called Landmark
[5:45:10] theDirtyon3: @Towelliee exit bnet and youll see the new store mount
[5:45:11] Dinermoe: maybe they dont have one yet
[5:45:13] ventu105: a survival game cool
[5:45:16] osatox: EQNext also was relying a bit on Landmark for player created content to do most of the art/dev work tho
[5:45:20] TheCliffyShow: At least, they got some mileage out of that Everquest Building game thing.
[5:45:21] kokochris: They are in end POC most likely
[5:45:23] dutchie76: thing is is it 2d or 3d
[5:45:25] raiwist: maybe it's a hunger games type of thing?
[5:45:29] ventu105: I want to be and orc on that survival game
[5:45:36] Xanafriel: @dabears5192 still no where near being a release or intended to be released game
[5:45:39] theDirtyon3: yeah its pretty dope
[5:45:39] dracullus: nice, I feared it will be like cat
[5:45:40] reggiepowa: cat is the best
[5:45:41] Donswag3: similar to Luminous starseeker
[5:45:41] trivotix: ratJAM
[5:45:41] dutchie76: spectral tiger lol
[5:45:42] Whiskey_Corin: All resources now being funneled into this. WoW in maintenance mode. It's over. It's all over
[5:45:42] Neostigma: Check your bnet launcher for gifts
[5:45:43] KingSlayerYotam: for us 6 months subs we get it a day or 2 later as a"gift"
[5:45:46] michaelmm: Playable internally but not willing to share recorded game footage = cannot keep it running for more than 5 mins without it crashing out!
[5:45:46] temp3st98: any new exp hints tho?
[5:45:46] lalelusa: it has wings T.T so ugly
[5:45:47] akia03: bliz new a game called a new world :)
[5:45:47] swordart_19: Tiger waiting room
[5:45:50] Hitokiri83: you will takes a couple hours @Towelliee
[5:45:50] Pannekaker: Ah damn, I hate mounts that sprout wings from nowhere Sadge
[5:45:51] Carrion90: Are you paid to go back to Wow?
[5:45:52] TheCliffyShow: It looks cool. But I wish it was red or orange.
[5:45:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: the 6 month offer usually takes a bit to pop up
[5:45:55] geokouts: tomorrow it will show for us the EU users
[5:45:56] raiwist: contact support?
[5:45:59] tomcruise210: im getting it
[5:46:06] valianya: where's the link to the announcement?
[5:46:07] dutchie76: yep
[5:46:09] DecayedmiNt: It takes a bit for 6o months to have it gifted
[5:46:10] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: meh
[5:46:11] Funderik: that's going to be a hint towards next expansion, like the vulpra thingy they added, they said directly it's linked to SL and we saw them as mobs.
[5:46:12] dutchie76: its big right now
[5:46:12] Xanafriel: All they're doing really is saying we are working on a new IP and need staff. Nothing about the game making it to be released
[5:46:13] HoppsiDejsi: it takes a day or to for the to send all of the them
[5:46:15] zilzihan: They usually roll it out in waves, took a few days last time to get it
[5:46:18] kokochris: If you contact support; they will give it to you asap. happened to me once. @Towelliee
[5:46:19] mandilozano: was there an announcement?
[5:46:23] Akermay: You already have previous mount from 6 month sub? Maybe only for new 6 month subs. I.E, pay for your next six and you'll get it?
[5:46:25] akia03: a bit late on that genre tho
[5:46:27] ralecgos: Maybe they need to focus on fixing their current genres first ?? lol
[5:46:27] pacificmc1: So basically they are making Rust 2.0
[5:46:28] Short_Film: Are survival games like Battle Royales?
[5:46:29] MasterNewt: Blizzard again doing a game from a genre that's been popular 5 years ago.
[5:46:34] coldhandsbeatz: they really should get into single player RPG
[5:46:34] Mazikeen69666: after the mage tower debachel im not coming bak to wow
[5:46:38] kokochris: @Akermay nah its right away
[5:46:38] Rudric_Ice: This is Blizzard's RUST
[5:46:47] Phantomstrk: the piece of that to view is "For PC and CONSOLE"
[5:46:50] Donswag3: @coldhandsbeatz Agreed, huge market for lore development, etc. for single player RPG
[5:46:50] Alegnowar: maybe it's like a better rust
[5:46:55] TheCliffyShow: Maybe you can poop like in ARK.
[5:46:57] Funderik: no it wasn't lol
[5:46:57] andrewexiled: your gonna see more of this tactic. Companies across the industry are struggling for staff
[5:46:58] dpbdagger: valhiem?!?!
[5:46:58] BTB00M: Hopefully its a Rust competitor
[5:46:58] Dinermoe: ye about that..
[5:46:59] Imprexive: I think its blizzards valheim
[5:47:01] ZakuzaGB: sounds likley to be PVP
[5:47:02] JaseLeland: a long time ago it was
[5:47:03] Havoc_S1: So like ark
[5:47:04] Akermay: @kokochris Ahh ok thanks for clearing it up
[5:47:20] Heero_Effect: Blizzards new world lol
[5:47:26] dutchie76: Valheim is good
[5:47:32] piratechris: Is two-manning a tormentor normal?
[5:47:37] kokochris: @Akermay no worries. it happend to me once. support fixed it asap
[5:47:39] swordart_19: WHERE IS MY TIGGER

[5:47:45] Shiekrunner: where is all the news coming from jsust woke up
[5:47:46] HoppsiDejsi: It takes a day or 2
[5:47:47] osatox: the 6-month sub gift thing will roll out usually within a few days
[5:47:48] Hitokiri83: @Towelliee it takes a couple hours sometimes
[5:47:48] EdgyMemeBear: If it's like Conan Exiles or Valheim I'll play it a ton LUL
[5:47:48] naznarens: it would be so nice to get a Destiny-esque Starcraft MMORPG
[5:47:48] swordart_19: I didnt get it yet
[5:47:49] ZyntosAran: i hope the survival game was not all the news
[5:47:50] Crypticedge: i am and i havent gotten it
[5:47:50] osatox: so just wait
[5:47:51] noah16hallmark: i also am 6month sub and didnt get mine
[5:47:52] Heero_Effect: Valheim is pretty fun. I have not played it in awhile but I enjoyed it
[5:47:52] bumpstock75: NOT LET
[5:47:54] MoistyBlizz: I am 6 month sub and it was not given to me
[5:47:56] swervity82: gifts take a few hours to recieve
[5:47:58] Alexkayzz: Next tweet: "We're excited to present you a few of the heroes for our new unnanounced game, which you can buy as an NFT!"
[5:48:00] byrdeen45: im a 6 month sub and i havent gotten it yet
[5:48:00] Phantomstrk: but it's not just PC only....so you can see the microsoft influence as they also say it'll be on console
[5:48:00] DecayedmiNt: Not yet
[5:48:00] aribellae: it takes a couple days, but it said 6 month sub on the first page you looked at
[5:48:01] 24sevn: need to announce something so more people apply, probably getting less applications after 2021 drama
[5:48:02] JaseLeland: I hope it's similar to valheim, but just more content
[5:48:04] michaelmm: They always take 2-3 days to show up after an annoucement.
[5:48:04] MoChuLu: towelliee, kind of off topic. you hear about some tbcc streamers getting banned by blizz?
[5:48:07] Shiekrunner: its advertised in europe as a 6month thing
[5:48:10] Korupcija_: why was cat not a 6 month :(
[5:48:12] dyslexican1: yeah remember the tree mount was spaced out and people got that over likea week
[5:48:12] Rabousha: SeemsGood
[5:48:13] xxcujozxx: sometimes its same day instant;y, sometimes it takes a day
[5:48:15] ashwing_: nope not yet
[5:48:19] dutchie76: now you guys will get Player Housing LUL
[5:48:21] Alegnowar: 0% chance anyone expected that
[5:48:21] Collected1: yeah that came out of no where
[5:48:22] 3663Sharad: So in Blizzard terms: we see this game in 5 years LUL
[5:48:24] mandilozano: was there an announcement? or just speculation?
[5:48:24] Elbathazar: i got the 6month sub back in September will  i qualify?

[5:48:52] Rudric_Ice: wish we had a video teaser or something
[5:48:59] jeffnsteff2019: IGN thinks wow is going XBOX
[5:49:03] Riggoz1: they cant even update their own games on a schedule and created a  new game seems weird
[5:49:10] shadowgrove88: think we get eny wow updates today
[5:49:10] TheCliffyShow: I'm looking at the big picture for the survival game. The character looks like a woman, and there's this fancy looking mirror on the ruins. That's gotta be noteworthy.
[5:49:11] laito_: did they announce something?
[5:49:14] Collected1: i'd say a preview at summer gamefest
[5:49:19] Dinermoe: towellie is typing monkaS
[5:49:25] lalelusa: BlizzOnline presented by Microsoft Teams^^
[5:49:28] andrewexiled: @24sevn its more an industry problem. EA just announced 3 unnamed star wars games for the same reason, for recruiting purposes.
[5:49:41] SirBiggimus: With Microsoft though, it also adds E3 reveals into the mix
[5:49:49] GregDinsmore: maybe it's just palia

[6:57:26] michaelmm: The paladin effect is bugged. it's currently firing every 3s instead of being a chance based on block %.

[6:59:52] Drogdorf: motes POGGERS
[6:59:56] therealknart: They did say on a twitter post that the release date had a 2 in it
[7:00:01] dracullus: February 10th reveal and 22nd launch, that's my guess
[7:00:02] andrewexiled: just announce one of the mobile games already. Hoping for galaxy of heroes/marvel strike force type game.
[7:00:03] scareu_: The new in-game store mount is up on wowhead, its a tigermount
[7:00:11] pacificmc1: @therealknart no they didnt
[7:00:12] N3llee: Max said something to the effect the 9.2 date was "obvious" if you really looked at the schedule.
[7:00:13] Neostigma: They are probably waiting for Square Enix to announce their Patch 6.1 date so that they can fight.
[7:00:19] pacificmc1: @therealknart also 2022
[7:00:22] ZyntosAran: lost ark is to big to mess with

[7:02:44] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee new T&E video about afrasiabi and sylvanas
[7:02:49] scareu_: you can see the mount now, a blue  waterinfused tiger
[7:02:57] d1stract10n: china is a huge market so yeah they will do one every new year
[7:03:02] luckfore: we saw it 2 hours ago LUL
[7:03:12] QuigsTV: @scareu_ this isnt like any water youve seen before tho
[7:03:15] Big_Joyce: When they did sub for 1 year for free D3 copy was marketing at its best
[7:03:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, millions of players in China....they should get a mount
[7:03:24] Fiivee_: new lunar new year mount :)
[7:03:40] Alegnowar: that new tiger mount is bis
[7:03:47] d1stract10n: @Towelliee i just did the 6month sub for the murloc back pack now i gotta do another
[7:03:58] lithium364: wonder how long they wanna stall the last diablo 4 class reveal
[7:04:10] andrewexiled: who cares. I think people are turning a story mistake into some grand conspiracy. Even if it was afrasiabi.
[7:04:13] Draco_wolfstein: lets go mount
[7:04:24] ArcaneSyntax: yo he shouts you out @Towelliee
[7:04:26] JimKappa420: question is if this is another scam mount like vulpin on rat or imperial quest 1st thay add this to store but after that re-color ib game for free
[7:04:28] luckfore: everyone that has a 6 month sub gets it as a gift anyways @d1stract10n
[7:04:32] Alegnowar: i don't belive that story about afasiabi, it seems just to redeem danuser and a bad story
[7:04:48] tomcruise210: dwarves as shaman are so cool, shouldnt have made draenei shamans. or draenei at all really
[7:04:50] lithium364: yeah who cares the guy was probably drunk at work and made an story mistake
[7:04:53] theDirtyon3: lmao
[7:04:55] Hinderhoof: are there any mounts that are like an Ooze.  that you ride in, not on?  i think that may be neat.  or it would look stupid.  i would have to see it.
[7:05:09] d1stract10n: @luckfore is it in our mai;?
[7:05:13] N3llee: I dont know if I agree with this Alex theory. I'm like 99% sure when Metzen left several devs said Metzen left them with enough story to take WoW into another decade of xpacs.
[7:05:16] d1stract10n: mail
[7:05:29] Alegnowar: can't belive a guy on a Billion $ ip can just do whatever he wants whit it, that must have been a group decision

[7:05:42] CCG_337: the only thing that will show if danuser is any good, is 10.o lol
[7:05:52] mavericks312: we live in a time we're ppl like to ignore the truth
[7:05:53] luckfore: @d1stract10n no in bnet under "view gifts" but it can take 24 hours to arrive

[7:07:02] Niksen_99: As a fresh 60 would you say go do campaigns first ?
[7:07:03] mikejames01: thats not how it works lol
[7:07:06] theDirtyon3: Some people will just think what they want .. head canon is real.
[7:07:07] JaseLeland: apparently someone who was at blizzard 2 years ago heard about this survival game, it's been in dev for awhile
[7:07:08] Moudi: towStop towIt
[7:07:12] N3llee: I dont know if I agree with this Alex theory. I'm like 99% sure when Metzen left several devs said Metzen left them with enough story to take WoW into another decade of xpacs.
[7:07:13] d1stract10n: @luckfore ok I'll check tomorrow thanks
[7:07:18] CCG_337: again, we will see 10.0 is any good? Because the new write will be on this wow team.
[7:07:21] andrewexiled: like what do they mean sabotaged sylvanas? did he just have a bad idea? hate the character? or are they framing as some hates women type thing?
[7:07:33] moa285: Anyway, the Jailer's story looks like a decision that was made within minutes.
[7:07:54] MrWeedoz: andrewexiled ppl are furiously looking for reasons to blame why they didn't like the way wow went to
[7:08:00] theDirtyon3: yeah chat is rough right now lol
[7:08:03] Sinergy_57: There is a difference in having the story laid out and actually written also though
[7:08:07] reinhardtdog: towStop towIt
[7:08:13] EclipserEU: this (ass)umptions are too much lmao
[7:08:13] RealSolaroid: The Jailer is basically Thanos to be fair
[7:08:14] A_Klimas: sometimes bad writing is just bad writing
[7:08:19] N3llee: clip it
[7:08:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[7:08:22] CCG_337: you gotta respect metzem lo, he has no part on this shitshow lol
[7:08:24] Rowwek: tweet from someone who worked at blizzard about the new game "I knew about it before I left two years ago, and it’s in a decent state if they’re announcing this much detail. Other than that I cannot say, as I am under NDA both due to my past employment and my relationship to a current employee."
[7:08:24] Shrenko: the story is pretty bad in SL tbh though LUL
[7:08:26] NoTimeToDieTV: its true, the jailer is just trash
[7:08:28] N3llee: new sub sound
[7:08:29] ralecgos: What do you think they will do with Sylvanas though? Redemption or Justice?
[7:08:33] Wreckagetv: Blizz made shadowlands in one night
[7:08:36] Velashen: Story is bad this is true.
[7:08:39] tekdubya: The jailer was created during the end credit scene of a marvel movie
[7:08:42] imnotdruish: imnotdruish subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 65 months, currently on a 65 month streak! 
[7:08:43] LorienV: after legion the writing was shit let's be honest.
[7:08:46] andrewexiled: now its bring back metzen type stuff. Like people weren't screeching about story in blizz games for years while he was still there.
[7:08:49] mavericks312: respect metzan for what?
[7:08:49] Shrenko: even Sloot didnt like it
[7:08:55] lobawow: @N3llee yes i remember that
[7:08:57] jeffnsteff2019: towStop towIt towStop towIt towStop towIt towIt
[7:09:27] N3llee: seems like everyone just wants to see the end ... hopefully everyone can move on
[7:09:34] OrangeSmurfette: THANK YOU
[7:09:34] TacticalWee: @imnotdruish towHi
[7:09:35] IianaDRK: killing sylvanas is so boring tho
[7:09:37] lalelusa: she's already dead inside and out
[7:09:37] Alegnowar: i mean we all know afrasiabi did some really bad stuff at blizz, but putting the balme on him who worked on this game for so many years whit also some great stories, feels like is a cheap "putting the blame on the bad guy"
[7:09:37] thenormalbeast: Genocide
[7:09:38] TheHardcorian: I'm on the copium train fuck it, gonna be here for 10.0. They have impressed me before with wow.
[7:09:41] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @pacificmc1
[7:09:41] d1stract10n: Sylvanis shouldn't die she was controlled
[7:09:43] Fray24_: Redeem redeem redeem
[7:09:43] BlindFaithFuel: Yo T, have you been able to get into Book of Boba Fett yet, or not feeling it?
[7:09:44] ralecgos: I don't want her to just DIE and that's it but come on man she literally GENOCIDED them
[7:09:45] NoTimeToDieTV: she commited genocide
[7:09:48] tekdubya: i still feel cheated we didnt get a whole expansion of Nzoth
[7:09:48] Pannekaker: I think I'm the only person who plays WoW for the gameplay and don't really care about the story, seems like all the Redditors suddenly started to care a lot about the story these past few years...
[7:09:52] mkringston: i am a raider so i couldnt give 2 fucks about the story
[7:09:53] TheUnknowing: I mainly wanted sylvanas to die because her story has just felt drawn out too long, but i dont care either way
[7:09:53] NoTimeToDieTV: thats a good reason for people to want her dead
[7:09:55] mavericks312: if ppl thought sylvanas was gonna die there crazy
[7:09:55] d1stract10n: she was under his control
[7:10:00] OrangeSmurfette: the Sylvanas hate is so old now
[7:10:01] Vendralos: she does deserve to die honestly
[7:10:11] MrClaudeSeaburn: I just hope 10.0 will be different
[7:10:12] Jigawatts42: not on board the redemption arc
[7:10:15] Sneekzx: @vintersfall Great show, 4 episodes in so far and I've been enjoying it!
[7:10:23] N3llee: by Metzen
[7:10:24] CCG_337: she will marry thanathos,  and retire to the mountains. end on the story lol,  telemundo finale.
[7:10:27] idenkaz_: Sylvanas is still alive because she sells merch KEKW
[7:10:27] ZabberzTV: nah man gotta keep her alive so we can make new body pillows with her new model for the hardcore sylvanas fans
[7:10:31] ralecgos: Slyvanas literally Hitler'd the Nelves though
[7:10:39] AssassinKhal: doesnt her book come out in march? her story will end in 9.2 for sure
[7:10:41] abracka_: so all the shit we were talking a few months ago is now null and void?
[7:10:43] mavericks312: 10.0 return of the windrunners
[7:10:50] Vendralos: @ralecgos she sure did
[7:11:05] N3llee: IF the stories are true we are still dealing with stories that Metzen wrote.
[7:11:07] fletch8: Night elfs Suck
[7:11:12] d1stract10n: Slyvanas was under his control her emotions were even taken from her
[7:11:13] abracka_: ahhhh i see
[7:11:15] realnzall: Are dirty puns related to the new mount allowed in here? @Towelliee ?
[7:11:23] Vendralos: @fletch8 That's beside the point though

[7:11:48] N3llee: youtube team needs this
[7:11:50] NoTimeToDieTV: He could have killed sylvanas at the end of Sanctum
[7:11:50] Tecni: Didn't Steve say that he liked the ending of GoT?

[7:12:26] ThatsProto: im not a big doomer, and i understand what you're saying - but at the end of the day, the story is shit

[7:12:37] OrangeSmurfette: FACTS
[7:12:39] smygel: its soo much hype from disgruntled blizz employees about how this survival game is looking. thats soo promising
[7:12:41] racketpunch: thats too much thinking
[7:12:51] ralecgos: It's not always about hating it. It's just distrust at this point
[7:13:01] fcsgamer: PTR build inc? Legggo
[7:13:02] NoTimeToDieTV: ^^^\
[7:13:08] jerexify: I don't like Sylvanas, but that's also not my whole identity within WoW. I also don't like Greymane, so there's that...
[7:13:09] cappei: Yeah, a trash one
[7:13:10] Vendralos: Are you suggesting there's no good reason to dislike WoW at the moment?
[7:13:10] bukka_hot: just a story 4Head

[7:13:22] Gruffian: I dont hate Sylvanas I just hate that the story wont end with her in a satisfying way
[7:13:27] Jigawatts42: Im just ready for them to move on from this character and remove her
[7:13:30] N3llee: people love a good bad guy
[7:13:45] Sinergy_57: Pandaria bad cus panda Madge
[7:13:47] rilsolo: because the systems stop people from playing the game LUL
[7:13:54] Pannekaker: @Towelliee Almost seems like a lot of people use it as an excuse to shit on WoW/Blizz, like an excuse is needed
[7:13:55] kevvlish_: whats wrong with just enjoying the game? and if you don't enjoy it - why just not play it? you don't need to talk shit all the time
[7:13:56] CullenPrime: Look at it this way. If the story is bad it can only get better in the next story.
[7:13:58] PokerFaceMoose: what I don't like about wows story is that they've been using so many of the same major players for decades, let's move on. new interesting people.
[7:14:01] N3llee: @Gruffian satisficing way is subjective.
[7:14:01] Heero_Effect: I don’t mind the story…I just need the game to explain it better and help me be a part of it
[7:14:04] TakeThatBack: wtf china...remade the ending of fight club where authorities win...
[7:14:11] moa285: If Bellular didn't make videos, I wouldn't even understand most of the story in the game. Plus, the cinematic at the beginning of Shadowlands didn't even play when Ysera was reborn. RIP
[7:14:15] futomara01: theyre prolly already world building 11.0
[7:14:16] havenbirch: If 10.0 story is better, we got evidence of why BFA and SL story  werent good
[7:14:18] vDrYuukey: i mean the jailer is in the game since wc3
[7:14:18] Jigawatts42: FFXIV has spoiled me story-wise
[7:14:21] TheUnknowing: they have probably had this story lined out even before like legion or some shit
[7:14:23] MOLAR305: remember the hate of the panda race?
[7:14:25] jeffnsteff2019: thats like magna fans being hateful towards animes ruinning story or like movies ruinnning book stories
[7:14:26] Vendralos: The Jailer didn't get anywhere near enough character development though.
[7:14:27] cinnamints: @N3llee I'm aware of this. It's irrelevant. I'm talking about attributing work to the people actually making the call at the time.

[7:14:31] NoTimeToDieTV: The story went from being tolerable up until BFA era, as a result of that people focused more on gameplay. Now that the story is no longer tolerable there is more focus to fix it.
[7:14:32] kroode7: the jailer concept art was way cooler than what we have now
[7:14:40] Dynelol: !yt

[7:14:50] chosen2choose: asmongold thinks we lost one big story patch because of all blizz negative stuff and corona
[7:14:50] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Arthas claimed to be serving the Jailor in Warcraft 3 Campaign Kappa
[7:14:53] xHukk: @Jigawatts42 to bad the game isn't good to go with it.  :\
[7:14:55] N3wl34f: Yep
[7:14:56] moa285: He was in the game the whole time. xenoCopium
[7:15:06] OhNoNotAgain: i love lamp

[7:15:19] OrangeSmurfette: I'm a Sylvana's simp no shame, drag me chat (^_^) dont kill my girl!!
[7:15:21] DrakeDuude: You know after BFA's ending cinematic after Nyalotha, they are going to go all out on this one
[7:15:22] osatox: can't please everyone
[7:15:23] emp_Megabus: I hope it's worse than the N'Zoth one LUL
[7:15:26] xHukk: RIOT on Their MMO:  Not everyone is going to love our MMO..  And that is okay..
[7:15:27] jeffnsteff2019: never dive into rabbit hole i enjoy game for what is
[7:15:31] Pannekaker: @xHukk Yeah, shame, I'd rather have a good game with bad story than otherwise
[7:15:32] d1stract10n: sylvanas has a statue she wont die
[7:15:33] ThatsProto: no doubt there are always unreasonable people, but there are definitely better and worse endings
[7:15:35] Zapp_Brannigan86: Wait, you're saying people hate for no reason on the internet?
[7:15:36] N3wl34f: Jalier turns out to be danuser, scooby doo style
[7:15:38] jeffnsteff2019: like a fine blue cheese and red wine
[7:15:38] cbiskit89: perfect ending: a bunch of master chiefs teabagging the jailor
[7:15:40] codedizle: @xhukk ffxiv not good? LUL
[7:15:41] Infinitepeeep: @Towelliee bought the new store mount yet
[7:15:41] ThatsProto: and i hope they end it on the better side of the spectrum
[7:15:42] LorienV: I hope he wins, we need a darn reset.
[7:15:42] Gruffian: Jailer was a fantastic bad guy that was executed in the game horribly. He has been overshadowed by the first tier raid boss.
[7:15:44] Milanesa_De_Pollo: probably lost a drust raid
[7:15:49] Yagr6: you can see at the top of oribos a missing patch zone portal slot
[7:15:49] luckfore: in a normal expac cycle we would be waiting for .3 now
[7:15:50] Jigawatts42: @Jigawatts42 that is definitely arguable, its vastly superior story is not though
[7:15:53] futomara01: ION SAID IT
[7:16:08] ralecgos: I hope one day Blizz does more short raids again
[7:16:08] shaxxtv: we are gonna kill the jailer who transfer some power to northrend into galakrond, thats were dragons comes into the game!
[7:16:08] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[7:16:10] Danestasia: @Towelliee What about the 8.3 end cinematic
[7:16:11] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  a perfect game for WoW is that you CANT go on to the next expac if you didnt kill the last raid boss
[7:16:13] cipusanx: the question is @Towelliee , can they make the jailer cinematic worst than the n'zoth one?
[7:16:14] Xsilentghost: He dies and we still lose bro
[7:16:16] abracka_: gul'dan type shit
[7:16:18] shaxxtv: or something happens with light vs void
[7:16:19] Short_Film: I'm fine with more Jailer, less Sylvanas
[7:16:20] Drax_1224: I wish they would just admit it tbh. kinda seems like they think we are stupid.
[7:16:20] Alegnowar: he can retire like thanos, since he's his scuffed clone
[7:16:20] bonkyouded: i would force it upon them
[7:16:25] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Let the Jailor win FeelsBadMan kill WoW
[7:16:26] chosen2choose: tbh il be fine with jailer in 2 expansions
[7:16:26] shabobado: And truthfully the only way you could change the story like that mid expansion is to truncate it
[7:16:28] xHukk: Assuming that they think at all.  :D
[7:16:32] jeffnsteff2019: jailer is laziest villan i seen i wow history
[7:16:36] LorienV: LUL
[7:16:39] Havoc_S1: New Star Wars games announced
[7:16:40] moa285: Azeroth in her omnipotence killed Jailer and we never heard from him again. EZ
[7:16:41] gali5656: why does bolvar refer to us as maw walkers? literally got quests from him in vanilla
[7:16:42] MaleFrom73: we die but he dies from warlock dots
[7:16:43] mavericks312: as long as the jailer is around so is sylvanas
[7:16:45] Skars111: thoughts on next expac story? or to early to tell?
[7:16:47] MrWeedoz: then get decapitated
[7:16:49] justagamingfiend: Sylvanas is going to take over the Maw
[7:16:49] N3wl34f: Didnt Ion say when ppl were fired that it was a chance to look at things for a new perspective?
[7:16:55] ralecgos: The undead are my favorite enemy type in WoW. I reallllly hope we get a new Scourge of some kind in the future
[7:17:04] abracka_: who gets to decapitate him
[7:17:16] RealSolaroid: I'm a lil' tilted that they just done dusted Denathrius in one patch though. Denathrius was a genuinely cool character.
[7:17:24] LorienV: They have fucking Arthas in this expac and did nothing with him.
[7:17:27] Hedrins: all i want is magni to pop in for a second and shout CHAMPION during the cinematic and i am good for 10.0 LUL
[7:17:31] bumpstock75: the story doesn't matter ..... just keep give us reskin mounts
[7:17:33] moa285: Next expansion: Azeroth strikes back EZ
[7:17:35] chosen2choose: that is why we need him for one more expansion
[7:17:36] moa285: LULW
[7:17:42] N3wl34f: @LorienV be glas LUL
[7:17:45] N3wl34f: glad
[7:17:47] rilsolo: built him up like they did the legion or something ResidentSleeper
[7:17:59] N3llee: i think the ret conning could have been done better and then the Jailor would have made an epic bad guy
[7:17:59] MrWeedoz: what was this jailer about? I thought sylvanas was the baddie in SL
[7:18:00] Skullbash0r: too much nipples, not enough villain, that is the jailer in a nutshell
[7:18:00] MOLAR305: excuse me Sirs, do you have time to speak about our savior Sargeras?
[7:18:03] Ferrolune: The jailer; the villain that split the community. I would argue he already is a winner
[7:18:03] LorienV: @n3wl34f true
[7:18:14] RageQTT: I actually found Sire Denathrius more interesting than the jailer
[7:18:20] Tairox: you saw blizz news?
[7:18:21] abracka_: wink once if you know what the ending is already
[7:18:21] NoTimeToDieTV: true
[7:18:22] RiptoreCA: ^^ true
[7:18:23] dudeimunknown: Hey tow whats rift farming and what to do with it?
[7:18:29] jeffnsteff2019: i agree i think he should slip through portal azeroth with his army since all hyoe of his army being mirrored to the legion army
[7:18:30] xHukk: We are going to wake up.  IT WAS ALL A DREAM!!! hahaha  @Towelliee
[7:18:32] Gruffian: It would be nice if they stopped living in the lore and just forged ahead with some new material.
[7:18:42] dHinTrO: Sire was an amazing boss fight
[7:18:49] Nasilvera: just wonder if azeroth will get a cata type make over
[7:18:49] Cafe0le: rift farming is what open world content should be
[7:19:09] Jigawatts42: @Towelliee what kind of cross faction system or end of the faction divide do you think we will see?
[7:19:13] schalde1982: no chance in helle next xpac launches in 2022?
[7:19:17] N3wl34f: Gameplay is good, systems are bad?
[7:19:18] chosen2choose: blizzard closed a lot of story ends in last 2 expansions
[7:19:19] ThatsProto: i think the lore is important. I like it
[7:19:28] chosen2choose: we got black empire in one patch, not whole expansions
[7:19:30] Kisswani: Some of the angriest motherfuckers on twitter are the story peeps

[7:33:03] Nokterian: hmm survival games are not my cup of tea
[7:33:05] Heero_Effect: Liquid as heavily SC
[7:33:12] Aidler: and boy they are liquid now
[7:33:23] Short_Film: Hope they revive the starcraft shooter
[7:33:28] shaxxtv: is it online or just a text we get?
[7:33:31] athalon: i just wanted 9.2 date Sadge
[7:33:41] spiked16: more like the past 2-3 weeks telling us no 10.0 announcment
[7:33:42] Short_Film: a man can hope!
[7:33:50] DecayedmiNt: 1998, but Nazgul started it in 2001
[7:33:55] RageQTT: Have we ever even gotten a announcement for the next exp before the last patch
[7:33:55] Scoodles91: never say never :D
[7:33:58] FiftykBolt: Any chance its like for 9.1 where we get the date 2 weeks before release?
[7:34:06] andrewexiled: starcraft ghost is the original and ultimate cope
[7:34:06] moa285: LULW
[7:34:06] Korupcija_: did that guy just retire?
[7:34:07] lithium364: was hoping for an announcement for the 10.0 reveal stream in march
[7:34:12] athalon: we just got jammed
[7:34:42] valianya: What if Microsoft makes a DOOM style Starcraft shooter?
[7:34:43] Thoreya: good riddance
[7:35:03] spiked16: @Towelliee when do you think they will announce 9.2 date if they dont do it this week ??
[7:35:09] Short_Film: J Allen Brack always reminded me of the villian in Kindergarten Cop
[7:35:14] kokochris: ya but could you see them any other way danNice
[7:35:39] andrewexiled: didn't the employees like JAB?. I know his position was untenable as he was effectively  way afrasiabis and others boss.
[7:35:48] Dinosew: So should they stop having Metzen play Thrall?
[7:36:00] Nasilvera: world of starcraft is still a dream
[7:36:00] Infinitepeeep: HOTS LUL
[7:36:08] KShellZx: Heroes of the Storm still has so much potential
[7:36:15] Layercake: Starcraft is a very powerfull IP to be in this state....HOTS not so much
[7:36:18] sorgesh: HOTS is free
[7:36:18] mavericks312: we have a better shot at a new guitar hero then HoTs lol
[7:36:22] GRVPHX: isnt hots free tho to play?
[7:36:23] andrewexiled: They put tons of resources and effort into HotS, it just didnt connect with people.
[7:36:25] xHukk: HotS is a bad version of League though.  :\
[7:36:32] xHukk: And league is free also.
[7:36:33] balanira: hots is just not good vs league and dota the only good part about it is fan service between blizzard games
[7:36:37] swordart_19: @xHukk totally different game
[7:36:41] athalon: take hots off the ventilator already
[7:36:48] swordart_19: @balanira totally different game
[7:36:58] drogobars: dota 2 is free too, but makes a lot of money out of battle pass
[7:36:59] uonhu: Swift Spectral Tiger with the Purchase of a 6-Month Sub in China WOW
[7:37:04] KShellZx: Wasn't the whole appeal of HOTS as being the "easier to learn/play"MOBA
[7:37:14] Alegnowar: hots came out way too late, dota and LoL where already giants
[7:37:16] lithium364: yeah the heroes got so dull after they had to balance them for esport
[7:37:18] Layercake: HahaThink Same thing that happen in OW2
[7:37:21] swordart_19: @KShellZx it is closer to arena game
[7:37:21] mavericks312: blizzard was to busy trying to make it an MLG game
[7:37:33] valianya: Heroes of the 'Soft across all franchises Microsoft owns
[7:37:34] xHukk: basically. hah
[7:37:37] Draco_wolfstein: it had alot of potental
[7:37:37] Alan_Holtzman: hi towellie HeyGuys
[7:37:40] kokochris: yup pretty much
[7:37:42] 91Niki: Oh yeah that game was 1000% aimed for esports to make money
[7:37:56] athalon: they missed the ball on the tee spun around and ran off
[7:38:00] balanira: league is the easy to leran/casual moba dota is hard to learn/complex moba idk if there is room for 1 more niche
[7:38:10] Syllvn: HOTS was my favourite Moba :(
[7:38:13] Rakim88: blizzard has mismanage alot of games cause of esports dream they kept chasing
[7:38:13] Layercake: ''Cmon boys and girls lets to the COD mines'' LUL
[7:38:22] SmygandeFizen: @Towelliee What new's are coming soon?
[7:38:26] Gingerprimer: None of Leauge or Dora 2 is "easy" to learn
[7:38:29] chromedomegames: just like MDI and mythic + tuning
[7:38:33] A_Klimas: HotS was also a fuckup from the beginning, they saw the original DotA mod, ignored it, and let Riot do it
[7:38:40] Alan_Holtzman: because money
[7:38:51] Velashen: The game was a lot more fun in beta and early times. They pushed it into esports and sucked all the life out of it
[7:38:52] A_Klimas: then later was like oh shit we shoulda done it
[7:39:04] swordart_19: MDI is like watching boring FOrmula
[7:39:06] Ferrolune: still no new news?
[7:39:08] Gingerprimer: @cephy70 tbf MDI is the only reason we even got Cathreal nerfs back in legion
[7:39:22] Ferrolune: I was here for that though :p
[7:39:23] Rakim88: HoTS started bad, it got fixed n got really good before the overwatch patch WutFace all went down hill from there.
[7:39:25] valianya: What's the Great Push?
[7:39:26] Heero_Effect: I think HOTS could be good. But didn’t you have to pay for heroes?
[7:39:31] Aravarth: Liquid character?
[7:39:34] Drax_1224: I would like to see the MDI with a great push format. so speedrunning lower keys but not head to head
[7:39:34] Mckhero: i really hope this was the big news ...
[7:39:37] SaDos: its just that the great push is more relatable.. we are all trying to push keys not speedrun a mediocre +18
[7:39:38] Aravarth: Oh, in a guild with Liquid / Limit
[7:39:41] grandmatb: whenever u say liquid i leak moist fluids
[7:39:48] rolando415: @Heero_Effect na
[7:39:50] chromedomegames: Good! down with MDI!!
[7:39:56] IianaDRK: hots 2.0 ruined it
[7:39:58] Gravity16: @towelliee are you in liquid really?
[7:40:00] schalde1982: Its a good game
[7:40:08] Smurflord: HOTS2 with Microsoft and Bethesda IPs included
[7:40:10] Rakim88: @Heero_Effect all be bought with gold, grind was crazy tho.
[7:40:18] Captain_Aegis: HOTS could be a great game again without a whole lot of effort I think.
[7:40:25] Wardem0n: Wonder if it’s gonna be like ark survival game or like the fallout survival game
[7:40:27] Gingerprimer: @Gravity16 the Guild LImit merged with LIquid and are now called Liquid
[7:40:39] KPable: he is online lol
[7:40:40] bartholimu: POG
[7:40:43] Kyphitz: he is on
[7:40:47] Gingerprimer: @nilone4 totaly new IP not wow related
[7:40:49] OoN01SEoO: WOW IS SOOO BIG IM HAVING TROUBLE LEARNIGN THIS
[7:40:51] PoopdeckClaxton: @Towelliee thdlock3....
[7:40:52] athalon: i set aside $100 from my paycheck to pay myself for playing wow in the evening
[7:40:53] Gravity16: @gingerprimer I knew that didn’t know towelliee was in limit, I’m a casual Andy viewer lol
[7:40:57] balanira: thd doing comp stomp
[7:40:58] Kyphitz: very bottom
[7:41:04] Gravity16: That’s awesome, you’re the man
[7:41:07] KShellZx: Microsoft should make a Super Smash Bros-esque game. They have so many options now
[7:41:13] Gingerprimer: @Gravity16 yeah np
[7:41:13] bartholimu: KEKWlaugh
[7:41:15] andrewexiled: nah too late. even when they really pushed it hard it never took off. HotS 2.0 was hyped a lot and was even well recieved. People just didn't play.
[7:41:15] Aidler: clippy as hero in HotS
[7:41:19] Drax_1224: its a bucket character to hedge loot luck
[7:41:20] Korupcija_: are they farming renown or honor
[7:41:23] Aravarth: So yeah, I think the idea behind HotS was kinda neat (in the sense of it being a MOBA combining the IPs of WoW, SC, and Diablo). But the difficulty with it is that it's competing for people's time that are all ready interested in those separate IPs — also while competing against other MOBAs.
[7:41:25] gvandaly: new mount in store
[7:41:43] mavericks312: you don't wanna mess with that smash bros monster
[7:41:44] codedizle: all stars LUL
[7:41:45] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee it wasnt that bad
[7:41:51] ditaern: and the nickolodeon thing
[7:41:52] Short_Film: Didnt Nickelodeon do one too?
[7:42:00] Aravarth: While the learning curve for HotS is a lot lighter than DotA or League, it just doesn't have the competitive ceiling of DotA or League — simply BECAUSE DotA and League are complicated.
[7:42:00] athalon: smash has just been around too long imo
[7:42:01] NickLeonhearth: but the game was good
[7:42:01] KShellZx: True, that All Stars game crashed and burned quick lol
[7:42:04] cbiskit89: people who buy playstation or xbox are probably already invested in an existing fighting game
[7:42:04] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[7:42:06] itsnative: WB has a smash like fighter coming out
[7:42:09] ditaern: and now Warner Brothers is trying it too
[7:42:11] JaseLeland: nickeldeon cheaped out and had no voices
[7:42:12] Rakim88: nickelodeon tried it now, its meh
[7:42:13] Whiskey_Corin: Valhalla was too good
[7:42:16] rilsolo: long awaited question who wins in a 1v1 thrall or master chief Kappa
[7:42:19] brendon_pao: brawlhalla
[7:42:26] Whiskey_Corin: ^
[7:42:29] gvandaly: have you seen the new mount in store?
[7:42:33] andrewexiled: @nilone4 they had a fighting game. although it was 30 years ago
[7:42:35] Aravarth: Like, nobody wants to watch the Worlds of pick-up football, they want to watch the Super Bowl. That's why League > HotS.
[7:42:42] mavericks312: if your not mortal Kombat or dbz you don't try and mess with smash
[7:42:42] ditaern: Fable made by Blizzard?
[7:43:02] Nokterian: They didn't gave Dota a chance and Valve picked dota up and so it became Dota 2
[7:43:10] Scaryrobots: fable is being made by playground games
[7:43:10] shimwood: Add Azeroth to Flight Sim PogChamp
[7:43:10] Nokterian: Blizzard missed that boat big
[7:43:28] Layercake: The Forza devs are making the new Fable ... Playground Games
[7:43:44] shinta__: that's a cool transmog shield
[7:43:46] Anbean: Anbean subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 94 months! 
[7:43:48] Nokterian: True
[7:44:01] IianaDRK: OWL KEKW
[7:44:05] Nokterian: Starcraft was huge in South korea and still is i think
[7:44:08] Gingerprimer: Yeah they failed both SC2/OWL/HOTS
[7:44:10] brendon_pao: lol
[7:44:11] Velashen: Starcraft esport was created organically by the community. Not the blizz team
[7:44:12] Rakim88: https://clips.twitch.tv/FantasticAnnoyingPenguinBudBlast-RrOwP54f1oDTr6_a dj wheat on OWL today LUL
[7:44:24] swordart_19: YouTube >Twitch

[7:44:28] Mecabeast: @shinta_ dark shore horde mog
[7:44:41] c0mmander_starscream: For starters they need to get rid of the frat house behavior within Blizzard
[7:44:44] Gingerprimer: @Nokterian SC1 is big in korea but that is mostly despite blizzard not because of it
[7:44:44] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Towelliee Reacts to More 10.0 Leaks!! youtu.be/RFsjHUzTCEY
[7:44:45] swordart_19: If wow section was on youtube i watch youtube only
[7:44:47] RageQTT: Isn't their relationship with twitch kinda fucked or am I wrong?
[7:44:53] SaDos: i mean SC2 carried the esports team simply because that game is so fucking better than any other rts
[7:45:16] JaseLeland: doesn't matter, microsoft's relationship is fine
[7:45:16] Rakim88: just more money YEP
[7:45:36] Heero_Effect: Unless you are dr disrespect
[7:45:41] Nokterian: OWL is pretty dead right?
[7:45:45] Aervyper: what are you talking about survival game?
[7:45:57] Holysal: @Nokterian yeah
[7:45:59] Mecabeast: i hope blizz takes  good points from ark rust valhiem etc
[7:46:06] Korupcija_: This used to be a 5 mounts per day stream
[7:46:07] JaseLeland: seems people in the know are very excited about this survival game
[7:46:12] c0mmander_starscream: I thought he was still banned?
[7:46:18] grandmatb: which warbringer mount? @Towelliee
[7:46:21] A_Klimas: that project is in good hands
[7:46:22] Heero_Effect: @sados  yeah man first 2 SC2 games I was hardcore into esports and playing
[7:46:31] A_Klimas: a few wildstar artists on it
[7:46:32] tsali_: I need to find a guild to raid with. I haven't have a genuine pve guild since legion
[7:46:45] Champzilla4Ever: hes prolly doing better on YT at this point
[7:46:51] Alegnowar: we don't know what kind of "survival" this game is gonna be
[7:46:53] RageQTT: I really hope their survival game leans more in the direction of valheim
[7:46:59] JaseLeland: we don't know if it's rust/ark or valheim
[7:47:01] gvandaly: Wen Lo, the River’s Edge Mount in stone now
[7:47:11] SaDos: @Heero_Effect no matter who managed the sc2 esports they would succed because of the quality of the game
[7:47:11] Lotarion_: Lotarion_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[7:47:11] MrWeedoz: WoW survival, you can finally play a peon!
