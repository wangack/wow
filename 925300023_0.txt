[1:14:42] dreioo: Barrens is great for watching a whole series season
[1:14:43] Nico_vdM: I thought it was a typo when I saw 4, usually they want 10. But no 4 was hard on its own
[1:14:58] Darkb4ne_: Westfall is nowhere near as big
[1:15:00] alicattz: what lvl can you pvp like warsong gulch?
[1:15:01] Shugaze: that's why barren chat was such a thing back then
[1:15:04] NewWorldReign: Classic Westfall is the best version

[1:15:08] northcub: why are you playing Classic while servers are still up?
[1:15:13] Vorog1: I leveled my warrior in classic in 6 days 17 hours played. Not too bad
[1:15:23] JJsChaos: How much faster is the leveling?
[1:15:23] Kinghorn: horde also dont have to deal with pillagers
[1:15:28] MidwatchOP: Westfall is no joke, barrens is still harder.

[2:20:53] crashoverride_gaming: Azersong is the realm you are on ?
[2:21:00] bypized: @Towelliee I'd think the same, but what makes me look at Classic like they care more is because of their quarterly earnings from last year, it was still really big
[2:21:01] KingSlayerYotam: SMOrc Clap
[2:21:02] ninjacca: Boomkin or Bear?
[2:21:02] OphieBee: Server Shutdown in 15 minutes PepeHands
[2:21:11] Communist_Smurf: @Towelliee so not a technical reason, just for nostalgia?
[2:21:17] Frank4LuLz: waiting for my blood elf prot pally
[2:21:27] tomato26: @HaloS23 @jerexify thanks anyway guys you rock! I also play on the worst SA server, Drakkari, its the lowest pop one SadEmoji Kappa
[2:21:27] crashoverride_gaming: Cool
[2:21:38] TheRiwen: w
[2:21:40] DatSheppy: Horde racials are insane that's why
[2:21:48] Teus_ic: TeusIC subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[2:21:57] TheRiwen: remove racials
[2:21:58] Communist_Smurf: right, but you are leveling a tuaren right now not a BE
[2:22:11] VictorAvalanche: because there is no BE till pre patch

[2:22:30] skodenztv: Towelliee why is your cam broke
[2:22:37] ninjacca: Are you playing boomkin to level?
[2:22:39] jerexify: !cam
[2:22:39] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[2:23:00] Kinghorn: EZ Clap
[2:23:07] Communist_Smurf: OMG HE CANT?!?!?!!? god you guys are dense....
[2:23:10] Frank4LuLz: honor
[2:23:16] yoloswaglols: dont you have a 60 warrior?
[2:23:18] fistofnature: i always took them LULW never knew we rolled for them
[2:23:24] stiiiiles: @Communist_Smurf you said a stupid comment and got roasted for it, hold the L
[2:23:33] Benzinni: Thanks for the invite Towelliee!
[2:23:51] Mecabeast: did you watch staysafes podcast with joker and kevin jordan regarding tbc?
[2:24:12] gidgeet: So I can join the guild and just be a casual?
[2:24:26] TranKilloLN: Hey Towellie, I've already got a 38 Warrior and 34 Mage on Azuresong, any chance for guild invites?
[2:24:27] Communist_Smurf: runs on same hardware unfortunately
[2:24:32] shungilungi: Hope your skin rash is getting better !
[2:24:44] Marmoh: Gotta patch all the bugs
[2:25:04] robertjordan83: @Towelliee jordan is just old and bitter about them changing his baby
[2:25:05] spanij: which server in us @Towelliee
[2:25:20] shungilungi: TLDR- Kevin doesn’t want any changes
[2:25:29] Frank4LuLz: hates pallies
[2:25:32] robertjordan83: not at all
[2:25:32] Saggyface03: I CANT WAIT FOR BELF PALADIN!!!!
[2:25:33] rambaldi00: TLDR Kevin Jordan is #nochanges and the seal ichange alone has made him angry!
[2:25:35] lanara233: Hazel was also on WowHead. It's good to see other streamers picking up the slack in OTK's absence.
[2:25:36] shungilungi: Kevin didn’t even want alliance to have shamans
[2:25:37] robertjordan83: hates the seal of blood change
[2:25:50] Etherdon: Prot pally leveling isnt too bad in TBC either. Round up everything and let them die on your shield spike.
[2:25:53] belfastcl: kevin don't want changed motivated by polls, he didn't say he was against all of them
[2:26:38] shungilungi: He said back in the day, blessing of kings out scaled blood lust on almost every fight because the fights were 5-8 mins back then. 10% buff > 45 second lust. He mathed stuff out too it was cool
[2:26:39] robertjordan83: @Towelliee he hates player feedback
[2:26:40] Redreka: whats wrong with polls?
[2:27:01] metavahn231: nobody wants a bad experience for the sake of being authentic for the purist
[2:27:02] robertjordan83: basically wants designers to develop games in a player free silo
[2:27:04] ch1rpz: I hated listening to that guy
[2:27:06] Mecabeast: he was afraid there were no devs doing math as the reason for changes
[2:27:11] ShadoodHD: player feedback unga bunga
[2:27:17] belfastcl: he did say he was against democratic game design
[2:27:21] MrIAmTrundle: MrIAmTrundle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! good luck today
[2:27:24] ch1rpz: I sat through it and it was clear he’s a bitter fuck
[2:27:25] UnholySouly: i dont care for kevin's feedback. he's part of the old game dev industry where they dont give two shit about anyone of critics their games
[2:27:39] yoloswaglols: gimme my 2006 pc back
[2:27:41] gidgeet: <------- Came at the end of BC
[2:27:45] lanara233: He supports the idea of having a vision and designing in line with that vision.
[2:27:45] datyty: Anyone know who Maximilus is? And what did he do
[2:27:50] Armdel: I started in vanilla, but didn't hit max level until BC
[2:27:51] belfastcl: @UnholySouly they managed to make some pretty decent games
[2:28:06] jjhill06: hey in the video for the 9.1 was that arthos that took over auduin
[2:28:10] rindelas: epi tome
[2:28:15] LasersLB: lol
[2:28:39] metavahn231: whos this keven guy i like laughing at whiney youtubers LUL
[2:28:39] stiiiiles: LMFAO
[2:28:43] SonofHorus82: who are we talking about and why is he talking shit about TBC?
[2:28:46] skulldrag03: Pop a mammoth mount KAPA
[2:28:47] ch1rpz: Yeah bro look at how many people are playing the game he thinks sucks
[2:28:50] swordwindgaming: Seal of Blood being faction exclusive was part of the problem which led to this population rockslide towards Horde
[2:29:11] BaxGamin: is there room in the guild for a hunter?
[2:29:24] elchaposkjelbo: classic gameplay is so slow, even runescape is faster
[2:29:40] corrosivecamden: @jjhill06 no it wasnt arthas it was the jailer although he used the same runes on his sword as frostmourne essentially making him lich king 2.0
[2:29:49] MuttonChopins: I think that surprised everyone
[2:29:59] dpbdagger: I really wish we had an option for fresh tbc servers
[2:30:04] Alaquane: I remember killing myself so much with seal of blood
[2:30:10] Holysal: it was orc racials is more of the issue
[2:30:11] coldhandsbeatz: When do you expect prepatch?
[2:30:20] MuttonChopins: Dont private severs do that either way
[2:30:23] Eternaalll: unless it's one some janky pserver
[2:30:26] KingSlayerYotam: kevin jordan talked mad shit on blizz on StaySafe podcast yesterday
[2:30:27] jjhill06: ok ty much
[2:30:29] Sarran_: yeah everyone will go horde for the pvp racials anyway
[2:31:04] kartheraxOCE: anyone who plays tbc over shadowlands is crazy
[2:31:04] MuttonChopins: I'm just going belf pally because belf look better in gear
[2:31:15] Creative_Pigeon: its Classic in it's most MIN/MAX form. Everyone knows exactly what the best piece of gear is, exactly how to do everyquest.
[2:31:19] karmadance999: is the shut down a pre patch for TBC?
[2:31:24] xXSiebzehnXx: but they're not a blood elf so they can fuck off LUL
[2:31:29] SonofHorus82: I know that madseason talked about the boost a bit in a video and he's not pleased. I could give a shit I think it's a great idea.
[2:31:31] coldhandsbeatz: How faster did levelling get in TBC?
[2:31:39] lekkahdh: you gonna play tank ??
[2:31:43] SomeoneStoleMyUsername: @creative_pigeon arena gonna be the most competitive shit
[2:31:43] shimwood: It'sa a long escort
[2:31:45] Brezitrex: All the way to ratchet
[2:31:48] Knocx: why u no bear form
[2:31:51] metavahn231: i dont like belf animations, too much twirling
[2:32:01] kartheraxOCE: half the reason why classic was so big was because bfa kinda sucked. there isnt that excuse anymore
[2:32:06] JubJubWantRubRubs: not gonna play your other vanilla characters in BC classic Towelliee?
[2:32:10] karmadance999: @Towelliee is this a normal shut down or pre TBC patch?
[2:32:16] D3m0nHunt3r666: 20 min escort lol
[2:32:23] SomeoneStoleMyUsername: When is pre patch tbc
[2:32:24] UnholySouly: Vanilla was all about the leveling experience. TBC is NOT about the leveling experience. People need to take off their rose-tinted goggles and get over the level boost already.
[2:32:30] UnholySouly: Y'all had your chance
[2:32:31] MuttonChopins: People just dont see that boost will make people used boosting less
[2:32:37] Pinzen03: Pre-patch is far off. This is just a regular shutdown.
[2:32:49] MrAxeffect: shadowlands is good but we are to the boring part
[2:32:54] Klauzzer: i am
[2:32:56] Creative_Pigeon: @SomeoneStoleMyUsername yep. all the strats are going to be nuts
[2:32:56] kartheraxOCE: pve loots shit yeh
[2:32:58] TheFabilolz: I'm not happy with Shadowlands, that's why i quited that shit :)
[2:33:02] Frank4LuLz: true...preah it
[2:33:08] Bombayshow: hulk meme content LUL
[2:33:09] KingSlayerYotam: If your a casual pve-r you prob stopped playing already

[2:33:16] Wildside1177: My guilod will be struggling to raid in 4 months
[2:33:17] PhantomX_Destiny: What's so great about pvp in shadowlands? (havent played it yet)
[2:33:18] kartheraxOCE: 9.05 tho should fix alot of pve loot issues
[2:33:19] warrenny: Casual ish working on hc and keymaster enjoying sl
[2:33:20] jjhill06: well i don't pvp but i like the shadowlands so far
[2:33:24] JubJubWantRubRubs: is PvP in wow retail arenas only still and normal battlegrounds being pointless?
[2:33:25] Aervyper: @Towelliee PREACH said 9.1 in August and if he's right OMFG depression TBC might be all that can save wow subs

[2:33:30] northcub: what I thought patch was in March?
[2:33:30] Armdel: to some degree i am happy. cuz it gives me some time to catch up on other games
[2:33:45] coldhandsbeatz: @phantomx_destiny the pvp vendors and gearing system is very good. Feels great to play and gear up
[2:33:47] Armdel: 9.0.5 is in march
[2:33:51] Pinzen03: BC beta will be "soon" according to Blizzard.
[2:33:56] SonofHorus82: as a casual player, I'm already well over Shadowlands. The Maw is the worst zone in the history of the game, I'm well over Choresghast, I dont give a shit about grinding anima every week for renown. It's seriously just bad.
[2:33:57] Jattell: might be an unpopular opinion but i like the downtime between patches to work on alts and stuff
[2:33:59] Eternaalll: @Towelliee what quest tracker are you using?
[2:34:01] Khalio23: am i a casual if i only raided normal and a bit HC? if so then yes dident enjoy SL
[2:34:15] Eternaalll: sweet,ty
[2:34:16] Oriqqs: @SonofHorus82 same
[2:34:19] DatacenterDude: Questie is the shiz
[2:34:20] northcub: Good Luck on Loots bois
[2:34:22] TombStoneMercenary: I dont know if it was due to covid restrictions but SL feels very bare bones...
[2:34:25] kartheraxOCE: Shadowlands in itself is fking awesome. just the pve loot system is pretty meh
[2:34:26] phantomex2006: what server?
[2:34:33] OhnoezUK: What are some of the things you're most looking forward to in TBC??
[2:34:34] flandre619: they really wanted to release the game before cyberpunk, shouldnt have released the xpack until after xmas imo
[2:34:41] BaxGamin: can i get a invite to the guild please baxgamin
[2:34:50] Khalio23: @TombStoneMercenary I feel the same way dude, feels very empty
[2:34:54] yoloswaglols: same
[2:34:55] Knocx: same
[2:35:00] darejewb: What nameplates is he using?
[2:35:02] Enitzu: same
[2:35:10] Rasulki: I'd rather watch this than retail LUL
[2:35:13] Armdel: excited to get some more stygia later?
[2:35:15] PhantomX_Destiny: @alexfdez17 okay thanks sounds better than BFA
[2:35:18] Redreka: same actually
[2:35:20] rambaldi00: hardcore casual. 5 toons 190-200ilvl. 5 maxed covenants. almost all outdoor mounts farmed....i'm just now starting to get bored.
[2:35:22] Eternaalll: @shetty425 i think it's the elvui ones
[2:35:23] Boliath: @Towelliee when do you think tbc beta will be out?
[2:35:23] LSBreed: @towelliee if retail is getting new content in 4 months does that push back bc or do you think it pushes it up?
[2:35:24] Alaquane: time to finish shadowbringers?
[2:35:26] Sincline387: the rate of reward drops once you hit 60, so it can feel blah
[2:35:27] Crowzcut: classic his the same
[2:35:27] jasperboy: Im hyped to play some classic and level my new hunter, but I CBA since char boost is coming
[2:35:28] Redreka: i look forward to vault thats about it lol
[2:35:30] nhcoohrh: you don't mythic+
[2:35:32] Enitzu: classic > SL. TBC is making me want to play wow again.
[2:35:38] spanij: @Towelliee WHICH SERVER IN US DUDE?
[2:35:40] shimwood: All the way to Ratchet
[2:35:41] swordwindgaming: Real talk, I only resubbed to keep farming Tomb of Sargeras for mythic cosmetics.
[2:35:42] abracka_: all the way back
[2:35:43] Zarinna2015: Yeah so far SL is a pretty fail Xpac
[2:35:44] Sarran_: is that a first for you? I feel like you have always been up to do something on retail
[2:35:45] Eternaalll: all the way to racthet i think
[2:35:45] PumpkinTME: Many people playing hunter in Classic? is Troll still best?
[2:35:49] Enitzu: all the way to ratchet
[2:35:51] stabbity13: yeah you got to escorte
[2:35:57] MILESkg21: all da way

[2:36:13] stabbity13: strollin'
[2:36:16] jerexify: @spanij No need to yell, man. There's a command literally in the stream title, and he's said it about 467 times. It's Azuresong NA, Horde.
[2:36:17] Enitzu: ill be rolling a hunter or lock on azuremyst tonight
[2:36:21] Enitzu: azuresong rather
[2:36:32] SomeoneStoleMyUsername: You think bis and that everyone knows what to do to get there has ruined the experience?
[2:36:33] Jlohh: Feels so good to be maxed gear 227ilv and not having the need to play unless I queue 3s or whatever
[2:36:34] shimwood: Free XP at least LuL
[2:36:36] Eternaalll: bruh the chicken escort...
[2:36:38] duncon: and @Towelliee takes back all he just said :D
[2:36:41] I_DoctorSatan_I: I used to be "gung ho" completing 10 M+10/11/12 keys for 220-223 loot for my 217 Hunter. Now, I'm really just completing 4 duns for two pieces of 220 or 223 gear. Alts, pretty much the same gettting either 213-216 gear. Just getting burnt out of SL at this point.

[2:37:11] spanij: TY @jerexify
[2:37:21] Crowzcut: 18 lvl 60s now
[2:37:26] azzurrin: Gearing is a double edged sword. On one end when there is too much RNG like WF TF, corruption and what not people complain. But on the other end when there's BiS and minimal RNG and much faster to get your BiS it gets boring and people end up quitting. So it's a catch 22.
[2:37:31] Marmoh: I love how belfs in classic are just dyed night elves
[2:37:35] DigitalChill: wait 10 mins they will be back up
[2:37:37] Wulfgrym: that shit is stupid

[2:38:22] Benzinni: Lux was pissed
[2:38:41] SpreedyTV: kas ??

[3:37:17] Anefz: dying to trash pulls >
[3:37:26] WhiteKnight74648: I gave up on alts this expansion. I spent more time looking for groups and getting rejected on them then actually playing them.
[3:37:26] zaraine1: one thing that helped me for 15s is the addon that tells you what classes are in a group
[3:37:37] dk_shrug: getting rejected from +12s as a 215 boomie cause "need fire mage /PI priest combo" LUL

[3:39:03] Daggerstry: DH? He wants a skull. For reasons

[3:41:37] PokerFaceMoose: might as well get hunters to tank
[3:41:45] Ragtop89: :O
[3:42:10] mrfear420: they should put SSC as a raid in timewalking , that would be fun ...
[3:42:28] SonofHorus82: so since this is TW and gear is scaled, would it be a good idea to use the Legion artifacts and Heart of Azeroth?
[3:42:30] Nottinghams: prenerf SSC
[3:42:30] Marmoh: @mrfear420 I really want sunwell!

[3:46:44] kekwnano: been farming glaives on 2 chars since WoD not one glaive
[3:46:47] SonofHorus82: @UniquePerson08 check LFG. It isnt queue-able, but groups should be up.
[3:46:53] Theduskflyer: I got fucking glaives BACK TO BACK weeks, on my fucking Druid
[3:46:54] luckyfooo: i dont know how many runs it took me but i got 3 main hand before finally getting the OH lol
[3:47:02] Highhvoltage21: ghost?

[3:52:10] Haximaxi: you can get the transmog for them if you own the original glaives from TBC
[3:52:15] Haximaxi: if you clear TW BT
[3:52:36] Daggerstry: See, with the ability to transmog legendary items now, I don't need to do timewalking BT lol
[3:52:57] Fptlol: you do if you want to mog the glaives

[3:56:48] mo197: duh
[3:56:50] NILLme: LUL Sure

[3:57:56] Kinghorn: of course
[3:58:02] MaX_DutchyW: its a newworld vs an old world
[3:58:15] sorrin143: when a old game better than a new launch title :D
[3:58:20] mrfear420: i would dodge tbc , ive already been there , i dont see the point in going back. but thats just me
[3:58:23] NILLme: that will be a huge "fk you" from blizz if they release TBC when New World is getting released
[3:58:28] Wulfgrym: pretty sad when the only game that can beat retail wow is a classic version of wow
[3:58:39] Pathwriter: We have to wait for New World release date announcement before we can find out when BC drops live.
[3:58:44] raldrik: love it, new world is a brand new game but people are more hyped to play a rerelease of a 14 year old game
[3:59:06] VictorAvalanche: we know what we getting in that 14 yr old game though
[3:59:06] paulson14: true
[3:59:17] Grock: @Towelliee are u more hyped for tbc than u were for classic
[3:59:18] DocsMistake: that is because classic wow is a better game than current wow lol
[3:59:23] NILLme: think tbc will be even more hyped
[3:59:37] rambaldi00: wait til Wrath

[3:59:51] Zivs: They only had that because of 10 year anniversary
[3:59:56] Zivs: it's not an usual thing
[3:59:56] Marmoh: That was a one time thing for the 10th anniverasary
[4:00:08] NILLme: riot mmo is years away
[4:00:15] paulson14: I am quitting retail after i hit lvl 40 in my cov
[4:00:16] Creative_Pigeon: ghostcrawler was looking for people on twitter the other day
[4:00:19] Imtheguy15: a wow killer has finally been made..... classic wow
[4:00:22] Murlocz: @Towelliee Ive been seeing the news on New World, and they have already made a lot of changes requested by players. Im really optimistic about it
[4:00:26] Zivs: Yeah that thing is many MANY years away
[4:00:29] MoodyVanessa: might have to be the 20th anniversary then Keepo
[4:00:35] DocsMistake: idk I still play Final Fantasy 14, I enjoy it and 8 man raiding is a decent change of pace from the larger scale of WoW
[4:00:47] Wulfgrym: all gaming companies are crying in their cereal because all blizzard has to do to compete is keep dishing out classics till wrath
[4:00:55] MuttonChopins: TBC if it comes out on June
[4:00:56] luckfore: same, im taking a break once renown 40 and will come back for 9.1
[4:00:58] laughing_octopus: ill quit after i get ksm
[4:01:03] NILLme: 9.0.5 is like Season 1.5 ... so thats like 3-4 months extra
[4:01:08] Marmoh: I've been playing WoW since 2008, a Riot MMO can easily take that spot if it's like any of their other games
[4:01:12] fistofnature: Renown tmog LULW
[4:01:15] Protosynx: Did ony eat the camera?
[4:01:17] Holysal: i got ksm and quit until next patch
[4:01:18] thecynicalshuffler: @Towelliee it will be funny if they make classic TBC listed as a seperate game just so they can have the top 2 mmo's... lol
[4:01:19] northcub: casual here - this is the best expo in 6 years
[4:01:20] BLSRougeKing: theyll keep the subs with people prepping for tbc tho
[4:01:23] S1appadabass: when tbc and diablo 2 come out, thats all i need
[4:01:30] thecynicalshuffler: top 3
[4:01:31] zaraine1: after ksm switching covenant and done with it
[4:01:33] amasis: i havent logged into retail wow in a couple of weeks.
[4:01:33] kaffeemon: yeah this long with only 1 raid is really boring
[4:01:38] griffdog125: back to the draenor
[4:01:50] roninnkush420: I'm playing escape from tarkov. kinda bored with wow
[4:01:53] kekwnano: so WoD 2.0?
[4:01:55] SonofHorus82: yeah how did that work out with WoD?
[4:01:56] TheUnknowing: then id probably stop playing lol
[4:01:58] DocsMistake: lol wow doing a story based expansion, Shadowlands aint it chief
[4:01:58] MuttonChopins: I don't think so, COVID hit while SL was in development
[4:01:59] SlayerLightStorm: @Protosynx Nope. Towelliee's got a skin condition that requires him to be shirtless for a medication he's got to take.
[4:02:00] Nottinghams: people have alot more time on their hands, plowing through content . hard to keep schedules i guess
[4:02:03] borgking82: @Towelliee only thing keeping me playing atm getting the key stone mount
[4:02:04] FresheFefe: what if bfa is better then shadowlands
[4:02:07] Just_Jaybles: wow 2 when we go to azeroth massive time jump etc
[4:02:08] raldrik: well if it lasts 2 years I would rather watch a tv show than "play" a game without content
[4:02:14] deckardblade: wod came out in november too and didnt last two full years, so def possible
[4:02:18] Wulfgrym: shadowlands is the result of blizzard getting their wires crossed and mis-reading the popularity of classic and trying to wedge it back into retail
[4:02:19] warrenny: would they do that tho
[4:02:21] luckfore: will 9.0.5. bring anything for people that dont do m+ ?
[4:02:30] RobNXS: Is that story going to increase my ilvl? If not I don’t want it

[4:03:22] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee I haven't even BEGUN to get the beginning stages of KSM.
[4:03:25] NILLme: i remember this being a hard boss back in the day
[4:03:28] kaffeemon: like if they released SL with like 3 different raids to progress through like other expansion did, it would be way more fun
[4:03:41] Mallaes: 👻
[4:04:05] NILLme: why dont you play the Black Temple ingame music? its great

[4:07:04] Needlse: Needlse subscribed with Prime. 
[4:07:11] NILLme: meaningful loot in retail and with season gear resets? What? LUL this is not classic where an item can last you till the end of the expansion
[4:07:16] Marmoh: I think timewalking raids are a huge success for that
[4:07:22] Zivs: Buffing raid loot back up again is a good step, and they did this relatively quickly. Normally i'd expect them to not budge until 9.2
[4:07:23] flebbooo: Are u talking about bringing back valor upgrades on raid gear?
[4:07:27] luckfore: they listened to much to the asmongolds and preaches
[4:07:30] Aeacus: tanking raid for my guild and not had a single drop in 4 weeks
[4:07:34] duhworks: is this TW
[4:07:37] mrbizhop545: Asmon and Rich were soooo big on make loot feel special during BFA and now neither one of them really play after they were the ones leading the charge
[4:07:56] N3llee: I want meaningful loot
[4:08:06] BMO: BMO subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! 
[4:08:07] cordawg: Thats because the design of the game doesnt support meaningful loot like classic. So the game is either a loot piñata, or its like classic.
[4:08:09] lieutenantdan416: it doesnt feel special either I cant put my finger on why though
[4:08:12] Crazdmadman: they took "make loot mean something' to be "less loot", whne people really meant "better loot"
[4:08:12] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:08:18] allthesnipez: thats why i quit retail and went to classic
[4:08:19] zaraine1: all they had to not change m+...
[4:08:19] N3llee: me getting a shit load 194ilvls from the table isnt meaningful
[4:08:23] brimtank: like actually feeling the difference when you throw on a piece that is 5 ilevels higher as opposed to feeling about the same, yeah i feel the same
[4:08:27] Marmoh: @mrbizhop545 I don't think Asmon or Rich have a significant influence on the development of WoW
[4:08:33] Trellian: *needs more Hand of Adal* titles btw
[4:08:51] abracka_: @Marmoh indirectly they do
[4:09:02] lieutenantdan416: lol ya
[4:09:03] fewyn: "about damn time"
[4:09:05] Durithane: yep
[4:09:09] Xailen: meaningful loot means the item needs to have a unique stat mix thats really good or special gimmick thats useful. we just get less loot overall
[4:09:21] Ragtop89: Truth
[4:09:21] sluggo5869: sluggo5869 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 12 month streak! 
[4:09:22] t_800_i: lmao
[4:09:23] MuttonChopins: "thank god I'm getting 35 anima"
[4:09:25] Carryout: FINALLY
[4:09:38] luckfore: they just need to revert it to legion/bfa and call it a day
[4:09:42] TweakT: but then when there's too much loot people get the wrong secondary stats and they're back to depression
[4:09:48] Clicklesly: It's not like M+ gear is good even, only the vault makes it a decent upgrade
[4:09:51] Naturalbeef: Blizzards mistake was listening to the mythic raiders
[4:09:53] AyeitzDenny: lol i wonder why blizzard thinks we want fken anima
[4:09:58] artlaur1: give me back tier pieces.
[4:10:00] fistofnature: The sword from Kings rest was very unique
[4:10:04] brimtank: the only time something feels meaningful right now is like getting that awesome anima power that makes you feel good for a few floors
[4:10:10] MuttonChopins: it would be nice if they make different sets for M+ and Raid, and just turn off the set bonuses when your not doing M+ or Raiding
[4:10:11] zaraine1: i was okay with removing titanforging and warforging but the loot drops are too low
[4:10:14] Jigy_LB: @towelliee Do you think Blizzard will ever move away from the idea of BiS gear coining from multiple forms of content.
[4:10:16] NILLme: i dont mind gear being difficult to get but let us upgrade it slowly up to max ilvl..
[4:10:22] AyeitzDenny: killed sire h 3 weeks in a row with only anima
[4:10:34] lieutenantdan416: im not a classic andy by any means but you really feel the impact there
[4:10:40] northcub: elitists being gear gated is finally allowing us casuals to compete in this game
[4:10:43] cordawg: Just bring back more sockets and reforging. and enchanting every piece of gear.
[4:10:58] N3llee: meaningful to me is something I immediately equip because its an upgrade and its stat'd well
[4:11:01] Zivs: that's not that weird i'd say, even for bfa/legion loot lvls @AyeitzDenny
[4:11:02] bobby031784: what is highest IL leggo?
[4:11:08] diln: you can invite other players into TW raids again?
[4:11:08] Zivs: 235 ^
[4:11:13] SlayerLightStorm: @N3llee Exactly.
[4:11:14] kekwnano: bring back coins for raids like wtf blizz
[4:11:20] bobby031784: ty
[4:11:37] PojaLive: I like how it is now, I still have drops I want to get. In BfA I had so much heroic level gear thrown at me I would be completely geared out after three weeks of a new raid.
[4:11:37] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[4:11:52] MuttonChopins: wasnt reforging random or something like that
[4:11:57] griffdog125: you don't even get anything special for professions anymore. no special gem, no procing on flasks and potions etc..
[4:12:05] FresheFefe: reforging was so nice
[4:12:05] N3llee: reforging isnt the answer
[4:12:08] Ragtop89: when was reforging introduced?
[4:12:09] N3llee: no it wasnt
[4:12:11] kekwnano: #BONUSROLLS
[4:12:28] infektyd: totally not random, allowed you to relocation a % of secondaries to what you wanted, so gear that wasnt BiS stats you could put some of the stats to what you needed
[4:12:28] Mauraderss: Reforming was a pain in the dick because you NEEDED a third party add on to do it properly
[4:12:29] NILLme: reforging in D3 is great, you can replace a specific stat with a different one
[4:12:30] N3llee: it sucked getting an upgrade and then delaying equiping it because you had to reforge it
[4:12:36] Mauraderss: Reforging
[4:12:41] HokageSilkie: Was introduced in cata i believe
[4:12:48] N3llee: Disagree 100% regorging was terrible
[4:13:05] N3llee: not being able to immediately equip gear was a bad feeling.
[4:13:08] luckfore: world bosses still dont drop loot
[4:13:08] Trellian: would res gear and res fights make it more meaningful?
[4:13:09] GamerKillance: Subs must of dropped big time if they made that change before 9.1
[4:13:10] Squanty: @N3llee as compared to getting loot to drop that you dont wear regardless cause it lacks the stats you need?
[4:13:18] lekkahdh: why do people hate reforging?????
[4:13:19] toobaked1987: @Towelliee. As much as gearing sucks. They have systems in the game that their community wants no part in. How the hell do you turn all of this around?
[4:13:23] infektyd: i liked it because if you had a piece of loot, could put some stats to what you wanted/needed till you got your BiS piece
[4:13:24] TheUnknowing: I feel like meaningful loot has been a thing of the past for a long time now, i think in the current state 'meaningful loot' may be tier or something like that
[4:13:24] zaraine1: even Legion was bad in the begining
[4:13:32] Nolaire1: They just want to make the feel game different, they fear keeping it the same always willd rive people away
[4:13:32] Soproatlol: but how do you know?
[4:13:34] Cloak780: WHY IS YOUR CAM OFF
[4:13:34] sneak_e_dog: @Towelliee when is the last time you think they got it right?
[4:13:40] artesi95: wtf that is the worst comment i have ever seem. bohoo delay to equip an item for 3 minutes..what a stupid opinion
[4:13:40] N3llee: @N3llee Thats a separate issue. Those two items are not one in the same
[4:13:44] MuttonChopins: They try too much in trying to reinvent the wheel when the wheel was already fixed
[4:13:45] TweakT: cause they don't have game designers like Kevin Jordan designing the game anymore
[4:13:47] cineris_3: cant think of an expansion that was done right from the beginning lol
[4:13:54] Dwarriortwo: @Towelliee They dont got mfs that care about the game no more
[4:13:55] cordawg: Blizzard over thinks everything.
[4:14:01] lieutenantdan416: what was 8.2
[4:14:01] Moobot: Don't forget that every month you get a free Twitch Sub with Amazon Prime! towSellout Step 1 - twitch.amazon.com/prime Step 2 - Hit Subscribe on my channel page and HIT THIS BUTTON BABY i.imgur.com/XCoETwY.png towPog
[4:14:05] Dwarriortwo: BFA was not bad at all
[4:14:07] lithium364: i despised the 8.3 content
[4:14:07] cordawg: Just make BC with more
[4:14:09] Affiiance: I loved BFD
[4:14:09] mrbizhop545: AP farming ang terrible if you wanted to witch specs or play alts
[4:14:10] Mauraderss: Was also a pain because if you got a piece of loot, you usually had to reforge all of your gear and move gems around if you min max. Was low key awful
[4:14:11] tebbix: MOP is my favorite but for nostalgia
[4:14:16] Durithane: yes raids were good in BFA
[4:14:16] cordawg: BFA ROFL sucks
[4:14:17] PhillyRhino: Do you think expansions start off rough now b.c they rush to get the expansion launched?
[4:14:18] Xailen: Its like people wanted a tasty cherry, but Blizz gave us a tiny red balloon saying its the same thing.
[4:14:20] mrzombiebull: What about wrath?
[4:14:26] NILLme: i had fun with the corruption system when they added the vendor, that was the best part of BFA
[4:14:28] idenkaz_: Stormwall blockade my fav boss of all time.
[4:14:30] luckfore: The timegating in Legion was terrible
[4:14:33] kekwnano: Twilight Dev
[4:14:35] N3llee: legion was a shit show
[4:14:37] Khandak: 8.3 was horrible in everyway possible imo
[4:14:37] MuttonChopins: Blizzard's philosophy is, trying to get people to stay as long as possible
[4:14:38] Squanty: @contentstarvedgamer thats mainly due to hit rating and expertise tho, things that no longer exist
[4:14:41] Bernardo994: I think the play is they dont need to get it right the first time anymnore
[4:14:43] Meta_meme: Nighthold by far was my favorite raid to date
[4:14:43] warrenny: Nzoth sucked too
[4:14:50] lieutenantdan416: it sucks cuz all my friends quit at the start of all these bad launches lol
[4:15:03] Zivs: Twilight Devistation LUL

[4:15:06] SonofHorus82: jesus I think the last time I was in Black Temple was to finish Green Fire.
[4:15:07] NILLme: felt good playing with 100% haste
[4:15:09] ThisTHC: I mean it was insane as dps as well lol
[4:15:14] warrenny: @meta_meme Antorus was great too
[4:15:14] Gruffian: 8.3 was fantastic for tanks
[4:15:21] OphieBee: I enjoyed 8.3 as enhance Shaman, stacking haste corruptions was a fun time
[4:15:23] Khandak: Yeah I get it
[4:15:26] wazon_7: is this private server or timewalking black temple?
[4:15:40] ThisTHC: yeah its a private server
[4:15:46] lekkahdh: this boss is hard

[4:16:21] wazon_7: MEMW
[4:16:31] kekwnano: 30 tanks in nyalotha was super fun
[4:16:33] Amishcow: our mages would compete to see who could kill themselves the fastest
[4:16:55] Marmoh: Reliquary of Souls is one of the best designed raid fights in the game
[4:16:55] Mauraderss: Why they ever ditched ; defence cap, dodge and parry, armour pen. Enough stats for everyone to juggle, removes the need for gimmicky armour
[4:16:57] lekkahdh: I miss bfa to, just fucking hated tol dagor... but ohwell we have fucking sanguine depths now lol
[4:17:10] tekfury: oom
[4:17:21] Allvarez: 3

[4:17:52] sinlesssinner: bres?
[4:18:03] Urebaldd: I always thought this boss looked really cool for back then
[4:18:23] Trellian: just wait for anger :)
[4:18:56] lekkahdh: this one schreden the living shit out of me first time in BT LOL
[4:19:03] xSivart: this boss was cheezable with certain ankhs/librams/etc it was great
[4:19:05] lekkahdh: scared,
[4:19:07] chums: How’re dranei shaman in tbc?
[4:19:27] xSivart: @CHUMS Shammy and Priest top heals

[4:19:55] BlueBeast33: Shaman in general are good, especially as the expansion progresses
[4:20:14] sinlesssinner: that was this phase
[4:20:20] sinlesssinner: u did it, now its just burn
[4:20:25] sinlesssinner: deaden it was
[4:20:32] Trellian: too bad it was mustly untankable by anything but a warrior due to spellreflect needed on Deaden
[4:20:52] sinlesssinner: @Trellian you interrupted it? lol
[4:20:59] soysos91: rogue evasion tank go
[4:21:05] sinlesssinner: @Trellian didnt need to have spell reflect
[4:21:15] SonofHorus82: @contentstarvedgamer I dont think they opened until Wrath since they weren't needed before then.
[4:21:23] we_are_whomp: its proxy based
[4:21:27] ch3fboss_: what happend to the camera?
[4:21:34] Trellian: i cant remember it being interuptable
[4:21:46] Molvonos: Somehow a 'Shadow Mend' pulled the boss initially
[4:21:51] sinlesssinner: you had to break the shield to be able to interrupt it, that was the challenge @Trellian

[4:23:44] Trellian: anger fase is actually pretty good for a pally tank (rage burn)
[4:24:13] SonofHorus82: I wish there was a vanilla classic TW that put the old style dungeons into retail. Could you imagine the Retail Ricks running a full on Sunken Temple?
[4:24:28] 91Niki: @Towelliee that peach rings is soooo guuud Kreygasm

[5:56:41] CrunkyBrewster: btw this is a weird question but why is there a rader_io addon for Classic? I saw it today and couldn't find info on why it exists
[5:56:53] BeerWithDogs: Cheer100
[5:56:57] TheUnknowing: Yeah a lot of people are bitching and moaning about there being no fresh servers but people will get over it.
[5:57:03] mutelibmb: anyone from Twisting Nether? is game dead?
[5:57:05] Dalsonson: Probably for raid progress @crunkutv

[5:57:35] CrunkyBrewster: @Dalsonson i thought that at first as well but i checked the raider site and there's nothing on classic raiding
[5:57:38] IIIIIIIIIIIXIIIIIIIIIIII: Last question and I'll piss off, is there a certain classic server that you guys recommend?
[5:57:55] metchato: why do people care so much for fresh though? economy will also be broken on fresh servers
[5:58:06] 1nc1nerated: dont go to stalagg
[5:58:10] 1nc1nerated: its deader than dirt
[5:58:24] dubber913: rip stalagg. xferd from there
[5:58:31] PvtHudson093: whats it taste like?

[5:59:06] Sonatta: what the servers are like today won't reflect BC release anyway
[5:59:09] J0rki: whats your classic main?
[5:59:24] roflpotamus: @Towelliee do you expect a large difference in faction pop for tbc? or pretty even like right now
[5:59:25] NinjaGlovz: So glad i kept all my toons on Fairlena and Earhtfury
[5:59:28] D3m0nHunt3r666: you tranferred your warr?
[5:59:30] J0rki: aaah ok
[5:59:31] Ragtop89: Im using Kangs Decapitator on my shaman with crusader, shit SLAPS
[5:59:42] xluckydawgx: @Towelliee How do we join Hammer Squad?
[5:59:42] mikkawz: how is earthfury pop @NinjaGlovz
[5:59:50] xluckydawgx: Non main raiding
[6:00:30] valvoline_: so much consume farming
[6:00:45] Everbliss: It sounds like you are looking forward to TBC. I kinda didn't expect you to care much
[6:01:14] YungDizzY: he said he would quit retail for TBC at one time

[6:01:57] mr_tateo: I was going to level a druid, but after hearing about the optional boost, I'm leaning towards being lazy :)
[6:02:13] Drekorve: @Towelliee What server are you on?
[6:02:16] bypized: Hey @Towelliee I'm wasn't even a Classic player, but your hype for TBC and my boredom in SL have convinced me to start Classic, just applied for the TBC Guild :)
[6:02:17] wreckshoptv: should let him die :P
[6:02:19] D3m0nHunt3r666: Run
[6:02:26] Sonatta: what is even going on LUL

[6:03:43] Murlock07: agrred
[6:03:49] milorgpvp: @Towelliee did they say anything at blizzcon about the account "restriction"? Aka you cant play live while u sit in queue to get in to your tbc classic server
[6:03:51] Murlock07: agreed
[6:03:57] legolas21: !TBC

[6:03:59] Meshindale: hi Tow i just tuned in, did you complte bc raid?
[6:04:02] J0rki: well if u count Classic wows leveling process, Classic has more content.
[6:04:25] dimofodi: That's how it was at launch of BC too wasn't it?
[6:04:37] Aidler: BC = Classic but better
[6:04:50] TheUnknowing: just gotta get people who are willing to tank but play other specs as well i guess lol
[6:04:59] Shamwise: so no release date yet?

[6:05:37] dimofodi: To be fair, we were asking for dual spec in BC originally too.
[6:05:40] Wulfgrym: oh it came out in wrath, nah
[6:05:42] Zivs: Duo spec is a good change but it's not BC
[6:05:46] flebbooo: they should probably just lower cost of respec
[6:05:47] Wulfgrym: let it come out with wrath classic
[6:05:52] Xannah08: if your gonna have boosted toons, id say anything goes
[6:05:54] flebbooo: if anything
[6:05:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: dual spec had a gold cost to unlock though, so make it decently expensive to take a chunk of gold out
[6:06:00] uawildcat04: @Towelliee Rogue or Feral DPS for PvE in TBC?
[6:06:02] Holysal: its on private servers so thats why they want it
[6:06:06] Malarick: didn't dual spec start end of TBC?
[6:06:09] Wulfgrym: why not add heirlooms if you going to start grabbing from other expansions
[6:06:10] Ludebro: they should cap gold cost before dual spec imo
[6:06:35] luckfore: towKing for azeroth
[6:06:42] alamonav: @Towelliee what made you choose a existing server vs fresh 1-70
[6:06:45] Kyrrua: Arena/bg spec in tbc would be nice cuz it affects nothing of the outside world, dual spec would
[6:06:46] alamonav: an*
[6:06:58] mulletrocker11358: END OR MID OF WRATH
[6:06:59] Aedarax: @alamonav there is no fresh
[6:07:01] aeon0987: 2.1
[6:07:09] Weeaboo__Chad: Are you going to play your Pagle warrior in TBC?
[6:07:14] flavio__m: hi guys
[6:07:21] Vanhoek: @alamonav there wont be fresh servers all existing classic servers get changed to progression servers come TBC prepatch

[6:07:22] alamonav: oh shit, thought they said they will have all lvl 1-70 servers
[6:07:24] xluckydawgx: It was 2.1
[6:07:47] alamonav: damn.. that sucks
[6:08:00] metchato: druids should be fine in tbc for tank and healer
[6:08:01] Vanhoek: @contentstarvedgamer bear druid was very viable in TBC
[6:08:04] Plague_GG: 2.1 is bc no?
[6:08:05] alamonav: @vanhoek @Aedarax thank you, i didnt know that
[6:08:24] aeon0987: @Towelliee Did you noticed that in some UI elements Shaman show up like a paladin color? I see it in Gchat with elvui....it's funny
[6:08:32] Ragtop89: Bear tanks in BC were godlike KEKW
[6:08:47] Alabastermatt: I’m sooooo happy there’s a one time boost so I can play the class I want in bc
[6:08:52] Ragtop89: I remember never wanting to run ramparts early on unless we had a bear tank
[6:08:52] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:08:52] Alabastermatt: Without the classic levelling slog
[6:08:53] TheUnknowing: I plan to main druid tank in TBC, maybe warrior if there are too many bears lol
[6:08:54] Haximaxi: yeah we had a bear MT
[6:08:55] branTVx: rogue tank 100% dodge on illidan for the memes @Towelliee
[6:09:00] Haximaxi: just not for illidan
[6:09:39] Kyrrua: I feel like tanks and war competition gonna be too high, so im prepping my mage :)
[6:09:43] Meshindale: in classic/BC does it matter what race goes with what class?/ is the racial bonus op?
[6:09:52] Plague_GG: how did rogues keep aggro on illidan? Was misdirect a thing back then?
[6:10:01] hansvann: Best healer for TBC? Holy priest or Shaman?
[6:10:06] Kyrrua: thx god I got 2 lvl 60 war/mage in classic already
[6:10:09] BlackMarmalade: you get enrage at some level but no i dont think you get stuff from behing hit
[6:10:12] cashflow0_: mr sir which class / spec u recommend for a total newbie how want to get into tbc?
[6:10:22] gemini903: didnt they say they was offering lvl 58 boosts
[6:10:35] Alabastermatt: Anything u want cyborg
[6:10:41] Kyrrua: blizzard "offering" ? LUL
[6:10:49] Xannah08: yes
[6:10:52] Alabastermatt: @gemini903 1 time paid boost per account
[6:10:53] ezpiron_tv: it does in TBC not sure about classic tho
[6:10:54] Ordicos: some
[6:10:59] stickyf1ngaz: can you boost if you don’t have a 60 char?
[6:11:03] NOHITJEROME: towelliee tbc prep helllll yeah
[6:11:17] NOHITJEROME: ooo these quests are scary
[6:11:24] Alabastermatt: @shaole well it’s more for people coming solely to tbc so ye lol
[6:11:43] Foogalicious: @shaole, you wil once pre-patch hits
[6:11:47] NOHITJEROME: feral gonna be so good for tanking tbc
[6:11:52] stickyf1ngaz: Nice nice
[6:12:02] Bazsidiver: male or female belf?
[6:12:05] Ragtop89: im probably gonna boost a druid
[6:12:06] IIIIIIIIIIIXIIIIIIIIIIII: I mained WW monk and loved it when I played WoW, what spec/class should I play in TBC?
[6:12:24] Meshindale: in classic/BC does it matter what race goes with what class?/ is the racial bonus op?
[6:12:28] Alabastermatt: God I can’t wait to get full BT set on my warlock, I’m ready to the max
[6:12:35] fartonthebox: Why doesn't he have cam on no more?
[6:12:35] Kyrrua: oh yeah dunno if it was you or another podcast but someone saying rushing phases like they did in vanillaa would be too harmful for bc pve/pvp
[6:12:49] Foogalicious: @Towelliee they are at the top of those towers

[6:13:23] zskeech: why no cam just lately?
[6:13:25] Alabastermatt: The lock wings when u Jump tho dudeee
[6:13:29] Kyrrua: you would barely have the time to do attunements or be full gear for a pvp season if they go too fast with phases :(
[6:13:31] Zivs: !cam @profuzal_
[6:13:31] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days

[6:14:02] Thewunk: Yeah it’s wild lol
[6:14:02] Ordicos: nope nor talk to people nor loot boxes
[6:14:08] shockvalew: what server is he doing horde on?
[6:14:13] IIIIIIIIIIIXIIIIIIIIIIII: Is Feral a good option in TBC?
[6:14:20] shockvalew: feral is good in tbc.
[6:14:23] xluckydawgx: FUCK plainstrider kidneys, ive needed 1 for like an hour
[6:14:24] mavericks312: blood elf pallies were op back in bc
[6:14:32] PsychoWarren: @Alabastermatt In TBC the wing was didnt work like that
[6:14:35] milorgpvp: @Towelliee did they say anything at blizzcon about allowing you to play live+classic at the same time on the same account? kinda annoying you cant play retail while ur in queue to play classic
[6:14:42] NOHITJEROME: LUL
[6:14:45] Zivs: @shockvalew Azure something, idk the NA names
[6:14:49] alamonav: did they give any estimate of when tbc would come out?

[6:15:16] xluckydawgx: I got 4 hooves back to back lmao
[6:15:34] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee prob security purposes
[6:15:36] MuttonChopins: probably account link
[6:15:39] kazaxu: where is Towel cam?
[6:15:42] Creative_Pigeon: its the same account
[6:15:43] Wildside1177: Shared files I bet.
[6:15:44] Ragtop89: probably to prevent account sharing?
[6:15:46] Keyastaron_: !cam
[6:15:46] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[6:15:51] Xannah08: because youd be less likely to have multiple accounts
[6:15:51] Keyastaron_: @kazaxu
[6:15:53] Zivs: Prevent Acc share would make sense
[6:16:01] DarkForce_TV: Login servers r the same
[6:16:02] PsychoWarren: Back then the wing was auto it was change later on
[6:16:03] kazaxu: thanks
[6:16:03] rolando415: yea account share
[6:16:05] Holy_Z: they use same files too i thought
[6:16:08] milorgpvp: @Towelliee yeah i legit reactivated my old account just so i could sit 3h in queue on my old account while i was raiding on my main one during the start
[6:16:08] Seerated: B-net probably stopping that. It's similar to you being able to open your main account twice
[6:16:14] Dalsonson: I thought it would be because it’s being paid with the same sub
[6:16:15] Garrujak: Well short of waiting in queues, there really isn't a way to "play" both games at once
[6:16:15] allthesnipez: ikm going hunter for tbc and man i keep running out of ammo lol
[6:16:24] RawrCute: it's just the same servers for the login.
[6:16:29] Garrujak: So I guess their logic is the only people using that would be acc sharers
[6:16:35] Ithylz: Didn't Blizz say it was to prevent people sitting in the queue instead of others while playing retail or was it only when Classic launched maybe?

[6:17:47] Ithylz: I'm not saying it's wrong tbh but I remember they said it at some point. Pretty sure it was at launch though
[6:18:08] milorgpvp: @Towelliee if thats the case i would think they could make some sort of system where you could play retail while you're in the queue, and when you get in its gonna give you a pop up: log out character and put me at the classic character selection screen or keep playing retail
[6:18:21] Wildside1177: abandon and get it again
[6:18:34] Zivs: LUL
[6:18:40] azuriens: what do you think the server que's will look like at TBC launch? @Towelliee
[6:19:00] RawrCute: If you log into classic with the same license as your retail then it will log you out from one or the other cuz of the same login. Pretty sure you can launch classic on a seperate lisence under same blizzard account while playing retail on another
[6:19:05] Foogalicious: longest escort ever

[6:19:54] johnnypeppx: DID I HEAR CORONA?

[6:20:07] Holy_Z: i feel bad for corona beer
[6:20:11] ExiaFTW: RICK ROSS 305 UP IN THIS B
[6:20:21] Holy_Z: everytime someone says corona they are gonna think about covid now
[6:20:26] johnnypeppx: corona beer is light beer i would not even consider corona as a beer
[6:20:33] korianti: Can't wait for tax season to be over for the tax ads to be done
[6:20:40] Shallo1988: snoop got that soda stream commercial
[6:20:45] chrslp: Roobet is no different than the CSGO loot box sites
[6:20:54] MuttonChopins: Corona beer really sucks
[6:21:27] MrMoerte: just Maul
[6:21:29] milorgpvp: doesnt bearform give you increased threat generation?
[6:21:34] MrMoerte: Maul is 1000% of the bear's threat
[6:21:36] Taz_85: That staged stream thing Snoop did for that game was pretty damn funny. The island survival game, whatever it was called
[6:21:37] griffdog125: man all the time grinding and only lvl 18.... the good old days lol
[6:21:50] roflpotamus: they didnt plan on ppl tanking as bear Kappa

[6:25:05] NOHITJEROME: they want people to raid and be in the endgame probably
[6:25:17] ezpiron_tv: thats because people dont play tbc for the leveling.. they play it for the endgame content
[6:25:36] chrslp: TBC was that perfect mix for sweaty players and casual players imo
[6:25:40] J0rki: TRUE!
[6:25:45] Holysal: private servers start at 1 is prob why
[6:25:47] MuttonChopins: leveling was fun to do
[6:25:53] Nico_vdM: i think the first road block would be that named dude in belf starting area
[6:25:59] sikboy_69: !TBC
[6:25:59] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now!

[6:26:22] kazaxu: blade edge

[6:26:23] aeon0987: Nagrand was it for me
[6:26:24] 0VAK0: i like it
[6:26:29] kershh: blades edge is the worst
[6:26:31] Thewunk: Nagrand!!!
[6:26:33] Garrujak: It's not that Zangarmarsh was bad, it's just than Nagrand is an alpha A1 zone
[6:26:39] Garrujak: easily top 5 in all of wow
[6:26:39] chrslp: @kershh Fuck blades edge LUL
[6:26:42] Wildside1177: Zangar is great. Tight. close together quests.
[6:26:43] rolando415: Nagrand still my favorite zone
[6:26:44] cashflow0_: at which level u can start do dungs?
[6:26:45] ezpiron_tv: @Aakku its for the people that dont want to play vanilla and want to play only tbc.. so they can catch up as the vanilla people are transfering level 60's over
[6:26:45] cynical_effect12: Loved the Nagrand quest with Hem
[6:26:46] Vanhoek: TBC was a nice level experience at least you didnt have to eat and mana every 5 secs like you have to in classic

[6:26:50] KnsWoW: Yea elemental platau
[6:26:51] milorgpvp: duuuuuuuuude, sporeggar <3

[6:28:19] MourvinMad: i might be down for that since I'm planning to do a lot of arena content end game
[6:28:21] Aakku: @ezpiron_tv my point is more it shouldn't be limited, because honestly i don't have time to level in classic and do what i do in retail.
[6:28:22] Meshindale: hi @Towelliee does it matter which race i choose for certain classesi n bc? is the racial op?
[6:28:24] Jynt334: i will gladly be a farmer of the hammers

[6:31:45] J0rki: You Retail babies #nochanges
[6:31:50] mavericks312: kara and TK were my favorites
[6:31:53] Sonatta: i love that the classic andys are freaking out over the level boost... claiming not doing vanilla ruins the BC experience LUL
[6:31:58] Nico_vdM: "we took months to kil eredar twins" "you want some fries with that?"
[6:31:59] Keyastaron_: its complete?
[6:32:04] chrslp: Black Temple is fun but long as shit
[6:32:06] TheOGMed: TK was #2 IMO
[6:32:16] Keyastaron_: damn
[6:32:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: Jebaited
[6:32:24] TheZlare: Should have shared the quest lol
[6:32:35] roflpotamus: probably was the questie addon
[6:32:57] chrslp: Honestly I'm really looking forward to Isle of Quel'danas. I enjoyed the whole zone raid included
[6:32:58] etter00: towCry
[6:33:09] PokerFaceMoose: escort quests were so buggy on classic
[6:33:28] Maksa_89: tbc getting fresh servers? :D
[6:33:40] TheUnknowing: No @Maksa_89
[6:33:40] TheZlare: Nope
[6:33:48] chrslp: Classic servers converting and fresh classic servers
[6:33:51] Maksa_89: lol why? economy will be a big problem
[6:34:17] TheUnknowing: Blizz doesn't want to, thats the only reason. @Maksa_89
[6:34:19] Sonatta: because no one wants to relevel 1-58 to get to BC, no one wants to grind gold for flying, we want to play BC
[6:34:19] Enitzu: @Maksa_89 been saying that since before launch but blizz dont listen
[6:34:26] chrslp: Economy is always a problem in WoW LUL
[6:34:39] Xannah08: they wont announce fresh tbc servers til its time to launch them, getting those sub dollars now
[6:34:40] YungLordus: what's your take on transmog in TBC?
[6:34:44] chrslp: Shit got worse when they let people buy and sell gametime for gold LUL
[6:34:49] allthesnipez: they should take little bit away like some peeps got 100k lol
[6:35:11] chrslp: People wanna get straight into that Outland nostalgia
[6:35:14] Xannah08: 100K? lol, i have over 600k on Pagle
[6:35:25] Shallo1988: is there an xp squish when bc comes

[6:35:35] secondarych: leveling is so stupid in wow i just want insta max lvl LUL
[6:35:36] Enitzu: not a massive one tho
[6:35:37] Wulfgrym: level a warrior and see if you want to love lvling
[6:35:40] Sonatta: Outlands = BC... if I want to level in Azeroth that's what Blood Elves and Draenei are for
[6:35:42] TheUnknowing: Most people arent going to care about fresh vs non fresh tbh, its a minority like always
[6:35:52] Roughneck124: Do you think the leveling will be a little easier than classic. What I mean is, not take as long to get to 60 as it did in classic.
[6:36:16] Sonatta: @Roughneck124 there will be a vanilla XP nerf
[6:36:24] Enitzu: leveling will be easier. less elite quests/mobs and lower xp needed.
[6:36:27] Roughneck124: Good!
[6:36:32] Sonatta: @Biby07 vanilla is not BC content
[6:36:36] chrslp: Theyd rather have dead fresh classic servers LUL
