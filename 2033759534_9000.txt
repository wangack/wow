[8:13:02] scarlboro: true
[8:13:10] peterpandam: Play some warrior sham 2s
[8:13:39] scarlboro: as much wrath is raid-loggy it is still a really really good game. you just only get to play for like 2 hours a week per char
[8:14:19] LessQQMorePewPews: @scarlboro u guys killed halion so fast 😔
[8:14:25] Dungbeatle_DB: you should use R on Alistar when he uses R
[8:14:46] scarlboro: we were trolling for like 20 wipes
[8:14:50] scarlboro: was starting to lose it
[8:14:59] LessQQMorePewPews: Still your killtime is good
[8:15:01] Dungbeatle_DB: wrong target for R
[8:15:14] NotASkiller: Ali when he ults
[8:15:24] Graycen: hey babe
[8:15:26] brothafeesh: people dying to the cutters is peak classic gameplay
[8:15:28] Dungbeatle_DB: Especially when he R

[8:15:58] scarlboro: @LessQQMorePewPews you can definitely go down to 4 healers comfortably i reckon. we ran 5 but i think 4 is enough
[8:16:22] LessQQMorePewPews: @scarlboro idk we spent like 45mins 5healing the first night and tonight was our 2nd go
[8:16:32] LessQQMorePewPews: tanks kept dying

[8:17:30] scarlboro: having your rets dispel seeds + bubble sac'ing cutter movement helps
[8:17:31] hrokk: "I'm troll judge, troll jury, and execu... troll!"
[8:17:52] LessQQMorePewPews: @scarlboro yeah just feels like people were overfocused on adds and dropping boss damage
[8:18:44] scarlboro: adds kind of need to be an after thought pushing into p2. just rando cleave doing the bulk of it
[8:18:52] NotASkiller: Not using the Titanic active LUL
[8:18:55] theJOATx: DO IT
