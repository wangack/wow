[0:13:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the estimate today is 4 hours of maintenance
[0:14:12] wulfgang71: why is there long downtime today if trading post only comes out tomorrow?
[0:15:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not sure exactly what they are doing with these long maintenances, I just have to guess they are working on server capacity and tech
[0:15:50] wulfgang71: well last week it was 10.0.5
[0:16:18] wulfgang71: maybe there will be no maitenance tomorrow then
[0:16:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Maybe they are moving some server stuff or adding to them or upgrading things, I have no idea
[0:18:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoWhead doesn't give any details, they just say 4 hours
[0:19:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: With the trading post, there is the possibility they are testing to make sure it's ready to go live and it works right

[3:22:58] Klax99: i guess the drops are gonna be available when the servers come up?
[3:22:59] sweetgoals: You'd think they'd have failover enabled so that you don't even know they're doing maintance on the servers...
[3:23:03] looney199725: no shot ppl still didnt claim them
[3:23:07] Respls: do i have to do anything specific for Towellie to get credit for the raid install and play through?
[3:23:10] ErokXP: ErokGG subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! \o/
[3:23:12] tebbix: yeah that's gotta be user issue
[3:23:19] looney199725: thats rough

[3:23:28] sweetgoals: after 20 years they still have to bring the servers down to do maintance? seems kinda dumb at this stage with technology

[3:24:00] looney199725: at this point its safe to assume every drop will be a tcg item
[3:24:03] Yagr6: rain falling on my head
[3:24:12] CaptainJoeyNY: Are all versions of WoW down till 11PST? Even classic and Wrath?
[3:24:15] looney199725: on a pillar
[3:24:19] spiked16: @Towelliee is that the only drop or is there going to be another one after that ??
[3:24:23] looney199725: uu == have rdps stand on a pillar
[3:24:29] salkazza: On a fence pillar
[3:24:52] denflup: no old gods in DF btw Kappa
[3:24:57] Sollice: @sweetgoals Across any IT space. When severs get updates or push patches there is downtime. Normally Databases have to build to affect change and if you want it to go smoothly and more quickly you have to have users not on the system
[3:24:58] lithium364: spectral tiger please i wanna see people mald out

[3:55:36] gritbarontv: no
[3:55:36] cerealkillas22: Well blizzard has cultivated a positive relationship with addons and player created content ever since Warcraft 3
[3:55:41] Sazuret: Yes, thats how Echo won KEKW (Kidding)
[3:55:41] DuhCasual: the game apparently has rules against it
[3:55:43] RayenDark: If the addon was only cosmeic, 100% yes they are world first

[3:58:14] duffluv22: Wait!!! How is Towelliee playing??!!! Im calling the KGB
[3:58:15] Energyzer9301: The TOS against Addons has been there since the relaunch of the game im fairly sure, people knew that and its their own responsiblity at that point
[3:58:20] looney199725: how can there be blind runs in ff with todays culture tho surely most these guilds just watch guides

[4:03:15] Yagr6: if its not capped then echo and liquid would full gear in m+
[4:03:18] doomkry: i think if valor wasnt capped i would have upgraded all my items to max from valor like 2 weeks ago xd
[4:03:18] CptFruitBear: Id be happy if i could just find a decent community of WoW people to run stuff with lol. pugging M+ keys is aids.
[4:03:20] Thoreya: 4 months for uncapped valor lol
[4:03:29] abracka_: it's one of the reasons i stopped  spamming m+
[4:03:30] Crizzle777: I hate the gating, it's such a mobile game feel

[4:03:39] Thoreya: @Yagr6 who cares tho lol
[4:03:44] RayenDark: I want valor uncapped for my alt, pointless for my main at this point in the tier
[4:03:44] ripperofbong420: the cap on the currency from the hardest content in the game is the weirdest shit ever

[4:03:51] Kuronokee: lool
[4:03:52] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Will 10.0.5 and 10.0.7 be as long as 10.0 as in same amount of weeks?
[4:04:01] Thoreya: if only they understood s4 was very well liked
[4:04:04] Thoreya: bc of that stuff
[4:04:06] coldarmorTBG: I think that if they allow pvp gear to be upgraded using honor which isnt really "uncapped" they should do the valor the same way..
[4:04:07] kamikazis: towOof towLets towGo
[4:04:12] itachiiie: Valor cap is going to be pointless soon
[4:04:13] Crizzle777: I think if they ungated gear their sub numbers would fall
[4:04:13] Aalee: servers back up or is this pty?
[4:04:14] tatertotpauls: Sucks for idiots like me that used it early on to upgrade somethign from level 1 and now don't have any available other than weekly increase
[4:04:16] Aalee: ptr*
[4:04:20] CaptainJoeyNY: I just wish  Heroic Raids were easier to pug.
[4:04:21] Greybeard_ttv: once we get uncapped valor we'll bitch because we don't have anything to spend valor on lmao
[4:04:24] Sh0cko: i think the second 10 guilds have cleared m ras it shoulda uncapped valor and released the catalyst
[4:04:25] Yagr6: @Thoreya blizzard
[4:04:27] Sollice: They understand...They just have to tease out the expansion for 2 years so they aren't going to give you everything you want right away
[4:04:39] jamtlandswe: is it this week trading post realeas?
[4:04:46] celic298: 3 hours fir reset ?

[4:10:24] Barret: so much higher participation on m+
[4:10:33] LoremasterMarthan: Raids by design will always have a "correct" answer, and then after that it is turned into Tmog farming
[4:10:35] GodKingMuninn: @Savage798 I get those and the signet 24/7
[4:10:40] Rudric_Ice: give us a new kinda content like a mix of m+ and raids
[4:10:42] fatal_flaww: M+ gets stale after a week of spamming it

[4:23:10] Yagr6: well the arguement is content is harder to get gear when 16s are a joke
[4:23:14] LoremasterMarthan: Crafted gear is not the same as embellished gear
[4:23:17] CeruleanStar: trinkets would be meh but
[4:23:20] The_Marijuana_NA: do you have to resubscribe with a EU account? lol
[4:23:22] wuhuzuhu: all 418 = no life
[4:23:23] eakiller: but you want tier pieces
[4:23:24] bioreducto: @ripperofbong420 not all gear crafted gear has embellishments

[4:23:48] ripperofbong420: oh i see that makes sense
[4:24:04] thebakeriscomingforu: Crafted gear can't be catalyst changed into tier
[4:24:07] theDirtyon3: yeah man people dont do their research LUL
[4:24:08] dimofodi: Do the food buff and potion one count against the 2 embellishment limit? I heard at least 1 doesn't.

[4:24:20] Sh0cko: a heroic raider in my guild didn't know you could craft gear w/o embellishments.
[4:24:27] ripperofbong420: they just cost too much gold for me so i havnt used them
[4:24:27] snake_like: you can get two pieces of 385 gear from sparks of life and storms which can be catalyzed into tier. that plus crafted gear is good casual gear
[4:24:28] DrkPhoenix6913: food one doesnt count, i know that
[4:24:28] Jewishraver: @duffluv22 bring back swapping stats out on gear
[4:24:30] AlphasaurusRexx: @dimofodi the food one does not. dont know about the potion one
[4:24:32] Yagr6: if ur not 410 are you even trying at this point?
[4:24:39] The_Marijuana_NA: do you need to resubscribe with a eu sub? or does the na one eu wide too?
[4:24:41] LoremasterMarthan: Food and potion ones don't count I believe
[4:24:41] ripperofbong420: i need my gold for repair
[4:24:41] Sh0cko: potion does
[4:24:51] rangedude123: Id be okay with M+ giving only cosmetic rewards and going back to raid being where gear comes from
[4:24:56] theDirtyon3: the real hack is the potion of ultimate power
[4:25:02] Rudric_Ice: we need this dungo in m+ rotation
[4:25:07] looney199725: i mean i dont think ppl understand
[4:25:08] dimofodi: I'm still not 410, I can't control what does and doesn't drop from vault for me and I can't run 500000 keys each week.
[4:25:09] CEK_kingdom: im trying so hard and just got to 410 lol
[4:25:10] HonestPhilosophy: Im 400 with no mythics at all im happy
[4:25:12] thebakeriscomingforu: Some crafted gear counts as a embellishment, but not all crafted gear has that.
[4:25:13] duffluv22: @jewishraver aww man. Refoging was soooo good
[4:25:20] looney199725: isnt like 90% the playerbase not doing 15-16s
[4:25:33] The_Marijuana_NA: im doing 19s at 409
[4:25:35] duffluv22: Reforging
[4:25:36] Uglyfoot: And sometimes pugging is just awful...
[4:25:43] snake_like: running dozens of 16's, the gold cost in materials, the gold cost in getting a crafter to make it at 418. it's a good alternative, but not easy
[4:25:43] CeruleanStar: if orbs/chaos were boa my rogue would be lit

[4:29:37] Fortvila: would love some classic ones tho
[4:29:38] PvtHudson093: because BFA timewalking is coming out in DF

[4:34:15] Foretoldlegends: Towelliee. Do you think that esports WoW players get to much of an advantage playing on the beta/ptr to learn the fights for when the races for world first occur? I feel nobody should get that advantage, especially if esports players and streamers can possibly get picked before a casual player.
[4:34:19] BobLongMVP: Going to be a cooler summer. Gardens will suffer

[4:35:00] Tripl3dot: gotta make sure the dungeons that have been in the game for 6 years are still working
[4:35:01] LoremasterMarthan: Introducing monetary gain and sponsorship to the race immediately takes the fun/enjoyment portion out of the main conversation and becomes secondary
[4:35:13] Shrenko: @supersloppysloth its not ptr tho

[4:36:31] Foretoldlegends: @biirrd Yeah but Blizzard won't hire that many GM's to monitor the stuff. It's why people say to be hush hush about exploits and don't put it on Youtube or else it'll get patched.
[4:36:33] looney199725: welp yano its not echo and limits fault there so much better
[4:36:34] SicDogg: @Towelliee new cam ? looks clear
[4:36:49] BobLongMVP: Race is meaningless now without China imo
[4:36:50] crimsonchins121: @shoops lol read the pinned message my guy
[4:36:50] LoremasterMarthan: The only variable to it ends up being money/time of which neither makes it particularly a better viewing experience
[4:37:03] Heero_Effect: towBlue towFire2
[4:37:04] dimofodi: I wouldn't say clearer, more illumintated. Lights are up a bit today. :)
[4:37:08] looney199725: why is the race meaningless without china?
[4:37:15] WoW_StandalonE: Oh remember this boss on mythic +
[4:37:32] akia03: chinese guiulds on na now
[4:37:40] GodKingMuninn: If they started at the same time I think they'd slaughter Echo
[4:37:42] Sollice: Were any Chineese guilds close though with this Race to EU/NA?

[4:38:15] looney199725: @boblongmvp they lose in mdi to echo alot tho
[4:38:15] Moobot:  Guess what? NA Servers are DOWN. DOWN BAD. Towelliee is on EU OR PTR SERVER. NA SERVERS WILL BE UP LATER. towCopium
[4:38:18] Yagr6: china guild in RWF now called VPN
[4:38:25] akia03: @Sollice 3 or 4 in top 10
[4:38:26] doomkry: man i remember watch alpha progress on KJ mythic, was kinda insane
[4:38:34] Sollice: @Sollice Yes but how many days after
[4:38:40] iseka11: do you believe if there was latam server would be latam guilds running for world first?
[4:38:41] looney199725: i mean we see china in mdi all time also before they left
[4:38:46] looney199725: they do good but echo still wins
[4:38:53] Snabido: Tomb of Sargeras was an experience LUL
[4:38:55] LoremasterMarthan: Also not for nothing I suppose, "drama" is a big selling point for viewership in these races i feel, and when it has become this methodical, the chances of anything interesting like that happening ends up being low. Thats why the most talked about portion of the race was just the very end actual kill because of "nerf drama"
[4:38:58] dtGhostie: Servers aren't back up already are they?
[4:39:08] LoremasterMarthan: Otherwise nobody even knew or cared what was happening for the other 7 bosses
[4:39:17] looney199725: i mean china would prob take a 2nd or 3rd spot
[4:39:19] g0n_z3n: Read the pinned message
[4:39:19] chefwonder28: wasn't it during the seplucher race that liquid paid out $47,000 in gold to people giving them gear cause they were offering 2-5 mil gold per piece?
[4:39:22] looney199725: but to assume they would be 1 is a lot
[4:39:23] falldrgn: @dtGhostie See pinned post at the top of the screen
[4:39:24] Sollice: Yeah I think there was @Towelliee Which is why them starting at the same time may not really matter?
[4:39:29] Foretoldlegends: @dtGhostie 2 pm EST it says. I think the maintenance could last longer.
[4:39:44] dtGhostie: @dtGhostie Missed that, sorry!
[4:39:54] iseka11: as a latam player, playing with 180ms is kinda impossible to be among the top players
[4:40:02] biirrd: echo 12/23 and kinda 12/29
[4:40:04] Sollice: The splits KILLED this race. Not players fault but thats what did it

[4:40:08] biirrd: china =)
[4:40:19] LX2_EXE: That's a real race
[4:40:20] Yagr6: blizzard caused that
[4:40:22] thebakeriscomingforu: The echo & liquid portion wasn't fun to watch
[4:40:28] Maxoru0: good morning towelliee and chat. wowgraMurkyHappy
[4:40:28] Skizzurp: yea the entire race was get to a boss and wait for blizz to nerf it
[4:40:30] looney199725: i think at this point the big boost in views will be when someone crazy comes along and just wipes floor with echo and limit IF that ever happens
[4:40:42] thebakeriscomingforu: The other participants were more fun to watch.
[4:41:08] csd_fustian: yep
[4:41:10] NotEnoughMana: WutFace
[4:41:11] raldrik: gearing is such a big part of the race but also makes the so damn boring
[4:41:12] Sollice: @Towelliee Its another movement bug
[4:41:13] theSalute: small indie company xd
[4:41:14] snake_like: H A C K S
[4:41:16] LearnedSomething: yeah  that's new
[4:41:16] LoremasterMarthan: I wonder if in the future they should do something in the realm of "force capping" effective item level during the first week of Mythic or something. Force a cap in farming gear to turn at least some of it to an attempted skill difference
[4:41:17] Yagr6: the matrix glitch
[4:41:17] csd_fustian: ive been seeing that this whole week on platforms
[4:41:20] Subbed_No_Ban: Elevator boss
[4:41:23] Sollice: The game still has issues with quick movement
[4:41:27] chefwonder28: @Towelliee got the twitch streamer glitch goin :)
[4:41:31] looney199725: well here is a fun take if they can launch a patch globally same time why cant we do raid tiers global launch same also
[4:41:31] coffeetimeeeee: If the raid could have been released a week earlier the race would have been much better. They wanted to tie everything up before the holiidays
[4:41:36] Skizzurp: it wasnt just raz tho even with kurog and dathea they had to be nerfed to be killable
[4:41:39] Foretoldlegends: I'm surprised some third guild didn't try to sneak in and steal it.
[4:41:43] looney199725: why is it the trading post can go live for na and eu on 1st but a raid cant?
[4:41:45] snake_like: it's how the wardens keep the demon hunters in jail. movement DC's

[4:41:52] Yagr6: i think they shouldnt stream the gearing process, only turn stream on when you pull 1st mythic boss
[4:41:56] doomkry: i mean the 50% nerf to shield on raz is kinda idiotic
[4:41:58] geokouts: the elevators sure are bugged
[4:42:06] Ovoprince: servers are up alrdY?
[4:42:14] looney199725: at this point they need to make global raid launch and reset its the fairest way
[4:42:17] doomkry: that the shield was even that high so its a stupid way to wall the boss
[4:42:18] NotEnoughMana: blizzard is kinda itchy with people gaining alot of money with the race
[4:42:19] CobblyWobbly: @Yagr6 Yes, splits are boring
[4:42:24] csd_fustian: looks like a few are
[4:42:27] falldrgn: thye were a lso trying to avoid another Sepulcher debacle
[4:42:31] LX2_EXE: Not sure why they thought that was ok
[4:42:33] mozavich: @Ovoprince no
[4:42:34] thebakeriscomingforu: @Ovoprince Nah, its EU
[4:42:35] Heero_Effect: Blizzard just wanted to go on Christmas break
[4:42:50] DallTV_: fun na whing on have 1 day advatage
[4:42:55] Skizzurp: the funniest part was when liquid sent all 19 players to 1 side during intermission and still couldnt kill it
[4:42:56] Fortvila: honestly just make the bosses easier, so they stomp it. better for the avg player and less splits
[4:43:01] Yagr6: stop streaming splits
[4:43:04] papaherc: race is boring, same thing everytime, same people
[4:43:09] Aquadriel: guilds should just organize themselves to make it more fair or this will keep happening.

[4:43:34] looney199725: welp now tier is back ul see more splits than ever
[4:43:41] LearnedSomething: I don't mind them doing the splits, but who thought it was content
[4:43:41] dimofodi: The question is, what do they do during the split time?
[4:43:42] Skizzurp: and race started and then no teams even went into mythic for 3 days kekw
[4:43:44] james_bah: just dont watch
[4:43:46] AlphasaurusRexx: i dont even start watching until they start doing mythic
[4:43:48] JaeDee: If loot was better I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd need that
[4:43:48] snarkydonald: caster therapy sessions.
[4:43:48] dimofodi: Like what do they cast?
[4:43:51] snarkydonald: lol.
[4:43:52] ZeusDNA: I usually would catch the boss kills or progress. This race, I missed almost every boss kill because most of the time was splits or M+.
[4:43:52] LoremasterMarthan: They need to take a hard stance on their opinion with supporting the race - for how much they keep saying it is community driven and decided etc. etc. etc., they keep their hand in the pot to make sure it finishes when they want. Dont half ass your involvment
[4:43:52] Alliewh33lz: Alliewh33lz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[4:43:52] doomkry: imagine having qa teams to properly test tuning
[4:43:56] cmitchell042092: I hated this boss on mythic+
[4:43:56] flewid: watching 3 days of splits, just to 1 shot the first 6 bosses
[4:43:58] Yagr6: but they lose money if they stop streaming splits right
[4:43:59] Lulaboo: Having to fill as a caster for 10 hours is ROUGH
[4:44:03] snake_like: commentators like dratnos are WELL compensated
[4:44:16] looney199725: im sure its not fun doing 14 splits for the ppl involved in the race but its what they need do to win
[4:44:20] Ceekayn_: mythic should be released at a later time than normal/heroic
[4:44:29] doomkry: dratnos and tettles as casters are GOATED
[4:44:41] DallTV_: heya Lulaboo =)
[4:44:47] LoremasterMarthan: Yea I think all releasing at the same time was recieved as an overall failure/annoyance
[4:44:51] looney199725: dratnos and tettles can talk nonsense for hours ye
[4:45:00] Merex760: Will they ever get rid of splits? Would the only way to make every difficulty a shared lockout again?
[4:45:02] DallTV_: so fun to see preach alex ? :P
[4:45:03] LX2_EXE: Lol omg, Opie and Anthony
[4:45:05] Yagr6: shannon and skip oh wait nvrm
[4:45:05] Lulaboo: @dalldk hello!
[4:45:13] Skizzurp: they have sorta set themselves up as a package for sure
[4:45:17] lithium364: theyre basically the power couple of wow
[4:45:19] ZeusDNA: Yeah I was curious how the all difficulty release at once would look. Overall, liked the prior version better
[4:45:25] Sollice: SKYYYYHHHHPPPPP
[4:45:27] falsenx: LUL

[4:45:57] Heero_Effect: HolidaySanta
[4:46:01] looney199725: blizz could fix this issue with the race if they just put the effort into global reset day and global launches same time
[4:46:09] mozavich: @Sollice lol i'd watch that

[4:50:54] LearnedSomething: we had a good system
[4:50:55] doomkry: then you get dungeons like ruby
[4:50:56] looney199725: the class buffs and nerfs also every week is a nice touch
[4:50:59] LearnedSomething: they had to go and fuck with the system :)
[4:51:09] csd_fustian: yeah they slap
[4:51:10] Skizzurp: i will say with them limiting the amount of days tho when it was up it was super active on ptr
[4:51:12] SeckSymbols: And what system was that?
[4:51:22] GodKingMuninn: Its almost as if you don't see value in a class you can give it a few extra % here so people can be like 'it don't do much but it got big dam'
[4:51:22] id_invaded__: Timewalking is so braindead you just hold W to bosses and pull everything same with levelling dungeons
[4:51:25] falldrgn: sigh.. the one bad part of Raid Shadow legends.. increasing Star rank
[4:51:28] looney199725: ye the class tuning has been gd this time they are trying more than normal
[4:51:31] EdgeOfTwilight: if a meta get established then they can make changes to over preforming and under preforming specs and classes
[4:51:36] akia03: shame class devs are silent still
[4:51:40] smashwow: idk enhance begs to differ
[4:51:47] smashwow: here's your 10%
[4:51:52] looney199725: shaman just got buffed
[4:51:52] smashwow: why we don't know

[4:51:55] id_invaded__: paladin dev feedback ? 0 KEKW
[4:51:56] looney199725: have u not seen how broken rshaman is?
[4:52:07] LoremasterMarthan: Class tuning has been great except for Mage who have 2 of there specs just get "here is a 5% buff to everything, good luck" LUL
[4:52:10] looney199725: rshamans doing 70-80k overall in AA
[4:52:14] Dox023: At least WoW downtime isn‚Äôt like ffxiv downtime. ffxiv downtime is an entire 24hr period. Although ffxiv patch notes are like a damn encyclopedia vs wow being way less notes.
[4:52:16] looney199725: all acid rain baby

[4:55:02] Skizzurp: maybe
[4:55:06] LX2_EXE: Keto and Atkins are not the same
[4:55:07] csd_fustian: yes keto is atkins-esque
[4:55:09] ripperofbong420: that is why i tried so hard to be a good disp priest but im actually fucking at it and picked up evoker. ez healer dmg lol
[4:55:12] Crizzle777: Trying to lose that last 15-20lbs is the hardest though
[4:55:14] JPBMDC: atkins and keto are similar
[4:55:15] Molvonos: Keto is like a more refined version of Atkins without needing the namebrand.
[4:55:20] looney199725: qualifiers are the 1st
[4:55:20] tumb_tack: Atkins was the precursor to keto
[4:55:22] akia03: isnt atkins just eat steak
[4:55:26] looney199725: so prob starts 15th onwarfs
[4:55:30] warrenny: Mdi drops?
[4:55:35] just_kirk_: much excite for mdi
[4:55:43] Yagr6: oh yea mayb mdi drops
[4:55:51] Crizzle777: keto is stricter than atikins I eat like 10-20carbs a day
[4:55:55] ArcaneMaki: Balanced diet is the key.
[4:55:56] looney199725: no tmoz

[5:57:23] Foretoldlegends: Honestly looking at Bear tanks as of late, people are putting them bottom tier. I think better scaling on armor gain in bear form, a general movement speed buff, and maybe better CD on Survival Instincts And other defensive spells Guardian Druids have could make them a lot better.
[5:57:23] mutant21: I accidentally vendored that whelp trinket and missed out on the recovery window to get it back from Blizz

[6:02:09] Squid1030: this dungeon is at the bottom of the cleftal horizon.

[6:02:18] wmadsen: Spiteful and Quaking, I'm taking the week off from tanking
[6:02:20] blake2895: As a monk spiteful is  cake
[6:02:21] Skizzurp: there are only 8 weeks in rotation
[6:02:24] CptFruitBear: quaking...time to make M+ groups with only range dps lol
[6:02:24] smashwow: grievous
[6:02:25] cerealkillas22: Just delete Explosive and idc
[6:02:25] warrenny: Spitefuls buffed by fort?
[6:02:26] Chiphazzord: now its tyranical spite ful
[6:02:26] Brayy47: aye at least we dont have inspiring amirite
[6:02:28] JqydeeR6: Not a terrible week but I just want some new stuff :P
[6:02:31] Dcarter: I fucking hate quaking
[6:02:33] ripperofbong420: yea ive been farming the whetstone but i cant raid. my brain is too smooth to tank a raid sadly @looney199725 LUL. i should lfr more. ill keep that in mind
[6:02:34] GingerGambit: spiteful and grievous was fun.....
[6:02:45] amaceika: The rotation is literally an Intern throwing darts at a dart board. lol
[6:02:48] Thoreya: quaking as a caster = miserable
[6:02:52] warrenny: @dcarter Cos your caster
[6:02:57] kevdeckie: I know grievous was like that.  But they're not going to have grievous again for a while (thank god)
[6:02:58] Skizzurp: na grievous bursting was fun
[6:02:58] looney199725: @ripperofbong420 if u can tank m+ u can tank a raid it takes less iq to tank raids
[6:02:58] Dcarter: Yeah I know
[6:02:58] LoremasterMarthan: Quaking makes me cry Mage tears
[6:03:06] myfans4141: whats this, wow.hheh
[6:03:09] mmrghost7: spites are super easy as Bdk just put DnD down they never move

[6:03:20] cerealkillas22: I dont mind quaking that much as Demonology
[6:03:35] Chiphazzord: eww quaking
[6:03:44] wmadsen: I can't get a pug group to leave the spitefuls alone, no matter what.   They DPS away on them and waste huge time.
[6:03:47] GrandGuy95: i mean mine as well get the drops you know that you can get to upgrade lol
[6:03:47] Thoreya: @baja6133 quaking
[6:03:51] CptFruitBear: Ive never done quaking it doesnt seem like it would be that bad for casters
[6:03:51] LoremasterMarthan: Quaking makes me want to play Fire Mage just to have a chance of getting casts off lol
[6:03:54] ripperofbong420: yea i need to get over it honestly. its more a personal problem
[6:03:54] neverbornlucky: if I do keys and get up in key lvl does that mean I'm still casual? I've always been casual playing wow
[6:03:55] mmrghost7: next week is deadly
[6:04:02] DecayedmiNt: @jenoneill1218 Overall it'd be suboptimal play to not weave in dps when healing isnt required. Part of what seperates good players from the lower spectrum.
[6:04:02] itskobyf: mines bursting volcanic
[6:04:03] LX2_EXE: Sounds like my bathroom on taco night
[6:04:08] jenoneill1218: I haven't healed in a long time, but I like to focus on healing and keeping my group alive, especially in a new xpac? I'm not against dpsing but that's really not my role. I guess I need to revisit the healing roll as of late, lol Thanks for the feedback! :)
[6:04:16] PvtHudson093: quaking on jade 1st boss or tree boss

[7:13:27] MrBeefquake: streamer priv hahaha
[7:13:29] dimofodi: guildie did a full aotc with funnel for 750k last night
[7:13:34] Masqerader: that's an overkill price imo
[7:13:40] Skizzurp: in wow tokens thats kinda a lot of cash
[7:13:41] ashwing_: 300k for Brood and Raza hc on EU
[7:13:43] Shrenko: @JMac8582 the bow is a very rare drop though might not drop
[7:13:44] sotsil_: what do you mean funnel since its group loot? you cant armour stack xD\
[7:13:44] The_Marijuana_NA: do you have to buy another sub if you go to eu instead or no?
[7:13:50] dimofodi: mal'ganis
[7:13:51] inj0shwetrust: Id never pay for aotc lol
[7:13:58] mi3f: essentially that is paying for brood and ras, since the first 6 bosses are puggable
[7:14:22] heltvild: @SotSilia not armor stack but they only invite like one of every armor type so at least you get all stuff that drops
[7:14:24] theDirtyon3: imperative KEKW
[7:14:29] dimofodi: everyone should just undercut the hell out of them
[7:14:55] theDirtyon3: @dimofodi have fun getting blacklisted then lol
[7:14:58] inj0shwetrust: Youd think though via laws of supply and demand.... Higher pop servers with good players it might be cheaper
[7:15:07] Sauby02: 3rd party gold would make it about ~$130
[7:15:13] heltvild: at that point just buy raz and brood and pug the first 6
[7:15:20] Masqerader: if u want a smooth quick run, i guess 2.5m is alright
[7:15:23] Gorad_: liquid is 2million for 8/8hc and 20mil for 8/8 mythic
[7:15:31] Skizzurp: with those guilds tho u paying for the speed of it too they gonna 1 shot it all u can prob get a cheaper run but who knows how many times they gonna wipe on bosses
