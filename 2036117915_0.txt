[0:27:51] jazzbanjo: Hi chat peeps
[0:27:56] jazzbanjo: @QueenofShebasCat Heya
[0:28:50] Emerald_Lord: Oh fun fact, you know the latest expansion? Dragonflight? apparently the original villain for the release was ACTUALLY meant to be raffarm, the villain from the hearthstone spin off.
[0:28:56] dizzydanturtle: You ever think they'll give the graphics another pass
[0:29:14] jazzbanjo: Yeah but why would you want to play a 15yo version of a game with a much more recent and better-looking version?
[0:29:42] DevZaren: It's called"  A ball in the sky !"
[0:29:42] QueenofShebasCat: The moon? falcoreGern
[0:29:59] jazzbanjo: thatsnomoon.gif
[0:30:08] Emerald_Lord: Because in the hearthstone expansion based on dragons, Raffam was able to resurrect galakron, the original giga dragon that made the dragon aspects to a degree. And he just...killed the horde and alliance and just flew off.
[0:30:12] dizzydanturtle: We will steal the moooooooon
[0:31:39] raggo2017: Warcraft bk in the day was amazing
[0:31:50] Emerald_Lord: Man what taco bell does to a mf.
[0:31:54] dizzydanturtle: Don't stab the planet, excuse me what
[0:32:26] jazzbanjo: @dizzydanturtle There's an excellent trailer you should watch
[0:32:52] jazzbanjo: doin' a lurk for a bit
[0:33:06] QueenofShebasCat: It's a little loud, not by a lot though!
[0:33:17] RubyDarling0502: seems fine to me, maybe a touch loud
[0:35:45] dizzydanturtle: Dragon = super muscley / Dragon man = atrophied
[0:36:05] k46sleepwalker: wait is this the dragonflight expansion? you get to go back to old barrens/mulgore?
[0:37:03] Bluboosh: Bluboosh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Wow

[0:43:34] RubyDarling0502: not true, there is a black spot with steam coming off it on shipwreck bay
[0:43:44] Bluboosh: I hear there are invisible rocks left as scars near sea dogs tavern
[0:45:18] Emerald_Lord: I remember the first character I ever made was a human Arms warrior...god that was basic but i had such fun
[0:46:44] Bluboosh: I re-installed Everquest1 the other day, still has my characters from 1999, such an unforgiving game
[0:46:57] Emerald_Lord: "the sirens chest ah yes a legendary tres- wait where did you get that canon?"

[0:58:07] Bluboosh: The very end of that video was amazing, it blew me away, amazing
[0:58:25] OG_Raziel: @ekatt330 There was a game called Legacy of Wizard that I always wanted to try again. I could never finish it as a kid.

[0:59:24] Idasy99: Waaaaaaitttttt

[1:00:31] Lord_Lethris: at this point - I genuinely think even Rare are trolling with cosmetics at this point (remember the grass emote)
[1:00:35] EKATT330: @og_raziel never played that one...I'll take a look at my local trade shop if it's good
[1:01:06] Idasy99: imma report you to rare, you're not supposed to stream the insider build
[1:01:11] SC4RLETSP1DERMAN: They should be more effort into a thing they are giving to us for FREE
[1:01:53] TactfulHonk: The speaking trumpet can't be anything other than a troll though. Gotta love it.
[1:02:34] QueenofShebasCat: They must be joking! It has to be!
[1:03:04] QueenofShebasCat: There is a part of me that is like... is it not a joke? It is Rare after all!
[1:03:11] OG_Raziel: @ekatt330 It was hard, but so good. I am pretty sure if you die you start over from the start with nothing.
[1:03:23] TactfulHonk: And yes, I think that is Argus to answer your musing

[4:35:29] DrPepple: 'Cozy game'. Doesn't it have little animals with AK-47s?
[4:35:56] Selinski: That's why I can't play mobile games aswell, it's somehow accepted in mobile games for the developers to beg for money, and you have to wait weeks for everything, unless you pay for it to complete faster
[4:36:11] DrPepple: Some really are close yeah!

[4:43:53] Selinski: Oh 5? Okay 👍
[4:44:37] swoop2000: Really good more open maps so play how you want to
[4:46:37] Selinski: The ghost warrior series of elite sniper, was the only ones places in modern times right?
[4:47:50] swoop2000: No cars sadly but the maps are big multiple objectives that you can do in any order but bigger maps longer sniping
[4:47:55] Selinski: Most of them are in the times around the second world war
