[1:13:49] Towle1: both
[1:13:54] Shrenko: what I liked with p1 is that they didnt show us any loot from BFD. Why did they show us loot from Gnomeregan this time around?
[1:14:04] DarkRhowen: Brotherhood was closer to the Manga.  But I watched both
[1:14:06] Towle1: it wasnt good
[1:14:09] mavericks312: death note live action wasn‚Äôt bad
[1:14:09] invisibleboomer: jarilirpg there was a live action sailor moon series

[1:14:34] Freeks417: Did the Jeff Gordon card sell yet?
[1:14:35] Amarlian: FMA is the original before the author finished the Manga so they creatively made stuff up. Brotherhood is after they finished the Manga series so it follows it closer, apparently. I like both @Towelliee
[1:14:59] invisibleboomer: Towelliee sir the only anime you should be watching now is SOLO LEVELING

[2:20:51] CeruleanStar: i think S2 ddidn't start fast enough for me so i fell off early
[2:21:00] raldrik: its because its just the same as season 2 now. You are strong but the season content is over after the first 2 hours. They havent figured out how to extend the season content
[2:21:05] CeruleanStar: disagree - i think i was lvl 20 and felt bad :(

[4:06:35] 07biby: since the 80s cars are basically computers
[4:07:55] penandsword49: it screws up your trading post every time you enter the raid. gotta leave to get it to reset, but if it counts, it counts.

[4:32:04] Molvonos: Chewy bacon has a place in BLTs and burgers
[4:32:04] Shrenko: did you see Zizaran new video about it?
[4:32:05] aimassistallen: me and a few buddies plan to dung grind... idk if thats  the most efficient way
[4:32:10] Molvonos: By itself, crispy bacon is best
[4:32:12] 91Niki: I am hoping to be done with D4 before Last Epoch comes out. I am level 90 and just need to finish the last season chapter. Almost there
[4:32:27] 91Niki: @Molvonos Agreed
[4:32:29] Nokterian: The full release will have tons of content and reworked starting area etc
[4:32:36] TheGamingDead: Yeah soft bacon is the best more flavor.
[4:32:36] Jango_: @91Niki  Barb?
[4:32:44] CH4UNCY: bacon on a sammy has to be crunchy otherwise, what are you doing with your life?
[4:32:50] JangoMigo: wasssupp lmao @Jango_ ive never met another hahaha and bacon should be crisp
[4:32:50] 91Niki: @Jango_ stormclaw druid until I get the helm, then lightning storm build

[4:33:35] Jango_: $30 i believe
[4:33:41] 91Niki: @Jango_ Its a really nice speed farm build. But not great on bosses
[4:33:44] Coldfire989: Primalist and Druid shapeshifs
[4:33:48] Shrenko: @Towelliee Zizaran's new video about why we should play Last Epoch is really good!
[4:33:52] Jango_: you will get your moneys worth from that game
[4:33:54] Sicknessqt: Ya they are not changing price
[4:34:05] im_capy: is it going to reset anything at full release if we start now?
[4:34:09] 07biby: i remember when betas were free... Kappa
[4:34:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: there is an ulitimate edition with some more transmog
[4:34:11] Jango_: @91Niki Yeah, i almost went druid but went barb when I saw the charge hota build

[5:40:43] ambiotic: I think so tbh, i could see a london superbowl. they want to move a team over there
[5:41:02] Vile_: Lmao, the sheer amount of people who'd lose their fucking minds over a Superbowl NOT in the US is near-innumerable.
[5:41:03] Heero_Effect: @verdell263 yeah I was gonna say I bet there‚Äôs a list already for at least 5 years out
[5:41:10] Wulfgrym: not the superbowl though
[5:41:21] Vile_: @ambiotic Absolutely not, they'd alienate the majority of the fanbase.
[5:41:37] Wcvechten: Yeah
[5:41:39] 3663Sharad: yes
[5:41:39] Molvonos: Yep
[5:41:41] Wulfgrym: im in canada and i can't see a superbowl ever outside of the US

[5:41:54] Ovium56: Yeah supposed to just be easier to get it all
[5:41:57] Vile_: I wish they'd implement that in DF.
[5:41:59] 91Niki: I think they limited tier sets? Unless they changed that
[5:42:04] Shrenko: except the tier tokens
[5:42:04] Wulfgrym: give london the Pro Bowl KEKW

[5:43:15] Wulfgrym: I can't see it happening outside of the US, even a team in Canada i would have a hard time imagining it
[5:43:20] Atem___: Toronto is the most likely out of US expansion/Super Bowl
[5:43:22] Verdell263: Only issue is the time of day in EU. You'd need to play that game at 10pm EU time

[6:49:48] Shrenko: herbs and ores
[6:49:52] pbnj_kills: your map seems super zoomed
[6:50:23] silasrumpkin: try the cave
[6:50:27] closetn00b: the only way i beat the bots is to gather in caves
[6:50:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Emerald Dream is not bad
[6:50:51] 91Niki: KEKW

[6:52:50] BetsyAndCo: Trainer?
[6:52:56] Alaquane: @jetributions he insta bought it and used it
[6:52:56] closetn00b: ones that have effects on them
[6:52:57] BlueBlurPrime: the elemental herbs and lush
[6:53:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: You just have to keep hitting all the herbs until 50, more or less

[6:56:30] realnzall: @Towelliee Have you heard about the Fyrakk loot bug yet? if you get kicked during Fyrakk, you get loot locked and count for the size of the loot pool, but can't actually roll on the loot, and people are literally organizing groups to exploit this
[6:56:44] heinekings: just extra herbs
[6:56:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Start gathering the runners quick, it will still pick it
[6:56:53] heinekings: you can click and move and grab more

[6:57:28] Alaquane: final step of relic weapon is now available
[6:57:36] Alaquane: waiting for dawntrail this summer
[6:57:56] Nokterian: KEKW
[6:58:05] ConductiFlax: The latest patch gave a short story, an prologue if you will to Dawntrail.
[6:58:22] Kelticlore: a new Moogle event just started in FF14 so those who want to farm it for the rewards are doing that
[6:58:33] Palludenx: WoW is BIS
[6:58:35] Moobot:  Interested in Towelliee's cards for sale on Ebay from his sports card rip streams? Check out his ebay store to see available cards and bid today! https://www.ebay.com/usr/tankrips
[6:58:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoW's roadmap for this year is lit, yeah
[6:58:42] Nokterian: i tried to play GW2 and i keep playing comfy WoW
[6:59:02] trivotix: Then the streamers that talked mad shit about the people playing wow and then ended up coming back to play wow themselves.
[6:59:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Last Epoch looks like a solid game
[6:59:58] Durithane: No
[7:00:01] Submarine_Mike: nope
[7:00:52] Huntauren: i played it, didnt like it tbh
[7:01:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: They say Last Epoch is a good middleground for ARPG's, it has some complexity but not too much
[7:01:42] TheGiant99: I like Last Epoch but it's just another arpg with a different skin.....
[7:02:05] trivotix: I was beyond excited for D4 and womp. =^(
[7:02:23] Aflictionn: whats the addon that shows it being interactasble above the object
[7:03:17] PurplePyrex: @Aflictionn huh?
[7:03:28] Kelticlore: personlay Id love to see WOW allow us to have every profession on 1 toon
[7:03:30] LeDerpski: @Aflictionn its in the settings
[7:03:33] drewetling: my pal dan
[7:03:35] jarilrpg: @Aflictionn turn on your interact key
[7:03:42] TheGiant99: No I get it. The end game of Last Epoch is just like maps on poe to me but just a tad different is what I mean
[7:03:52] Aflictionn: oh thats what it is, thanks
[7:03:52] Heero_Effect: @kelticlore would be nice
[7:04:13] TamaskaVT: Heya Towelliee thanks for the Blizzard Collection Trade :)
[7:04:28] zelours: Does phase 2 release in hour this time next week?
[7:04:38] 91Niki: That's what makes them ARPGs ;)
[7:04:44] 91Niki: Hence the genre
[7:05:04] Heero_Effect: new world still kicking ?
[7:05:04] reggiepowa: wow is best
[7:05:06] SpilledMelk: FFXI is pretty different
[7:05:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: New World is waiting on big stuff later this year, but it has a core of dedicated players
[7:06:07] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee The new Murloc toy unleashes a murloc army at a random rate. Just notced that KEKW
[7:06:10] t_train_va: Visual MUD's
[7:06:19] 3663Sharad: if you are in combat
[7:06:24] TheGiant99: I'm gonna play the shit out of last epoch.
[7:06:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Amazon is committed to it
[7:06:58] SpilledMelk: FFXI came out 2 years before WoW
[7:07:07] TheGiant99: @91niki I agree I guess to me all the talk of LE being the savior of the genre is crazy
[7:07:18] zelours: @towelliee with phase 2 next week is it just a transition like when a xpac comes out or will the servers go down?
[7:07:36] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 People are always on that copium train when it comes to new games of an old genre. Same with MMOs and being the new wow
[7:07:50] 91Niki: or wow killer rather
[7:08:14] runehako: 16 hours

[7:08:42] Heero_Effect: every new game is the savior lol
[7:08:50] tr4ncetv: Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari after 2024 season
[7:08:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: POE keeps its spot as the most hardcore, I think
[7:09:04] Vendralos: If the wheel aint broke...

[7:09:19] SpilledMelk: Everyone said Grim Dawn was great, but it feels so sluggish to me. They finally added dodge though, so that helps
[7:09:25] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 I personally see Last Epoch as something else to play. POE is too complex and causes anxiety for me. Too many systems to keep track of. Waiting for POE2 to come out. Last Epoch will be a good middle ground, not as simple as D4 and not as complex as POE1
[7:10:11] TheGiant99: I agree @91niki 100%.....I play all the arpgs fir the most part
[7:10:13] 91Niki: @SpilledMelk Grim Dawn is another game I really wanna play. But it's a backup game, and 2023 and 2024 is just packed with games

[7:10:47] TheGiant99: Yea I can't do POE anymore
[7:10:50] 91Niki: Yeah POE1 straight up pushes my brain into burnout. Too much thinking
[7:10:53] SpilledMelk: It's fun 91Niki. Worth playing, but feels pretty slow at the start
[7:11:08] Vendralos: Season 4 itemization rework might be good for Diablo 4
[7:11:15] 91Niki: @SpilledMelk Yeah i tried it for a bit, but then something else came around, so never picked it back up
[7:11:42] Vendralos: Bosses need to cost less of the summoning mats in D4 in my opinion
[7:11:54] TamaskaVT: I agree 100 percent about the lack of endgame content. I was thinking that it'd be cool if the seasons all were tied together telling one big story. Then after 4 seasons get 1 raid which is tied to the story.
[7:11:54] SpilledMelk: Definitely worth playing
[7:12:29] SpilledMelk: This Diablo season was not that great
[7:12:50] 91Niki: Season 1 of D4 felt like a filler season, so does season 3. Even the store barely has anything good in it. It screams filler
[7:13:08] Vendralos: @91Niki Odd team seems to be dropping the ball lol
[7:13:32] SpilledMelk: Yeah Vendralos, agreed
[7:13:34] TheGiant99: @91niki I get that same feeling. I like playing but I think your right

[7:14:27] 91Niki: @Vendralos I'm thinking it has something to do with prioritizations, and perhaps internal stuff going on, like layoffs or some other stuff. Season 1 felt forced, getting a quick season out. S3 feels like a filler, while they work on exp and s4
[7:14:41] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 Yeah I am having fun too. But it feels like a filler
[7:14:42] Vendralos: @Vendralos Could be
[7:14:44] Heero_Effect: I like the controller for d4 saves on carpal tunnel
[7:15:18] 91Niki: @Vendralos Then again, D3 and POE first seasons was also pretty meh. So I am not judging honestly
[7:15:55] Vendralos: @Vendralos I'm sticking with D4 for a while. I think they'll eventually make the game pretty good. I don't needlessly shit on the game like everyone else.

[7:16:53] reggiepowa: did you get those new store cosmetics
[7:16:56] Heero_Effect: I think D4 also needs tier sets‚Ä¶.something to chase and build
[7:17:01] TheGiant99: You think you want WASD but then you realize you didn't lol
[7:17:25] ambiotic: it ruined d3

[7:17:29] Vendralos: because people shit on them in D3
[7:17:41] heinekings: I loved sets in D2
[7:17:42] ambiotic: it just became one tier set was good and it rotated seasons
[7:18:04] Heero_Effect: yeah D3 tier set hunting was fun for me
[7:18:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Save the herbs for the weekly turnin quest yeah
[7:18:07] 91Niki: I am hoping they will do tier sets for d4, but make it better and learn from the mistakes in d3
[7:18:19] limeyjohn6: limeyjohn6 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Yeah!
[7:18:25] ambiotic: if they make 2 sets then that would be cool
[7:18:31] Alaquane: limegr1Hype
[7:18:44] Vendralos: @91Niki There's some 2, 3 and 4 piece sets in D3 that are not class specific that are pretty cool.
[7:19:02] 91Niki: @ambiotic Yeah probably a better idea. Too many uniques and stuff like that in play that makes 4p or more difficult
[7:19:39] Vendralos: yes
[7:19:40] Heero_Effect: what gives me hope is people forget d3 was rough at first
[7:19:57] im_n0t_jezus: yeah it has
[7:20:00] 91Niki: @Vendralos I mean more mistakes of what Ambio mentioned. With certain tier sets being best and rotating each season. It makes it feel stale very quick
[7:20:10] happyheals: d3 real money ah was awesome
[7:20:17] Heero_Effect: that‚Äôs also true haha
[7:20:19] 91Niki: Not the same devs
[7:20:34] Frosted2319: thats my problem it should have been done when it came out
[7:20:36] 91Niki: Just look at COD and Battlefield. Same deal. Not the same devs
[7:20:45] ambiotic: I still do not understand what they think seasons are, because they are just so thin. They cant think its enough
[7:20:56] happyheals: We think we do, but we don't
[7:21:15] 91Niki: Just not how game development works
[7:21:27] 91Niki: Even more so when you throw a team together that might not have worked together before
[7:21:29] happyheals: D4 is Kirby
[7:21:35] GodTheMechanic: Like if WOW 2 came out with no dungeon finder and agi cloth
[7:21:40] Heero_Effect: maybe d4 needed more time in the oven?
[7:21:48] 91Niki: or even worked on ARPGs before
[7:22:02] ambiotic: This season hard sucked tho. But maybe its because itemization rework is taking so long.

[7:22:48] cs_nano: Not to mention - Diablo Immortal's "success".. that they also could have learned from, to add more content to D4
[7:22:49] Heero_Effect: yeah CoD today ain‚Äôt the CoD I loved on the Xbox 360 lol
[7:22:56] 91Niki: But I agree, it would be nice if they could learn from past games mistakes
[7:23:04] Huntauren: how do i unfreeze an item in the trading post?!
[7:23:19] CDubTheRIPper: KEKW
[7:23:22] 91Niki: @cs_nano Now Diablo Immortal was in fact made by a whole other studio. Blizzard just published it
[7:23:30] runehako: use an analogy

[7:23:43] runehako: are we talking kiwi to egg?
[7:24:16] RoboMaximillion: lol
