[3:09:04] mokabear: only 1 needed pearl in main raid today
[3:09:23] mokabear: did randall get it?
[3:09:50] vmttmv: hydra would've had to get super lucky to get pearl on randle given the kind of randies he pugs with =D
[3:10:25] mokabear: i mean, just swap in next main raid and I'll do hunter

[3:13:26] crokette_: Never seen the staff on all my chars
[3:13:28] motod0x: that would be cool
[3:13:48] motod0x: drop % wouldnt be accurate obviously tho because of small sample size, but would be a cool feature regardless
[3:13:55] motod0x: unless you sync it yeah
[3:15:47] superbart2la: why not epic boots?
[3:19:28] Skipiz852: but the marks only stay there for 24 hours no ?
[3:20:19] mokabear: I want you to know that 200 badges would be 66.6 wins
[3:20:51] mokabear: Time this match
[3:21:25] mokabear: 11 hours isn't actually too bad
[3:21:30] mokabear: Just gotta win 'em all
