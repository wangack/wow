[1:04:46] xlKit: 3
[1:04:48] Mauar: @flycosis theres something in ddr5 compared to 4 that makes higher cas in ddr5 similar to the lower cas in ddr4
[1:04:50] taegoLake: @Mauar check with Asus of much Density this mobo can run DDR5 7200mhz, with 32gb or 64gb ? because currently i can't say, and if you buy 64gb or more, you might have compatibility issues and result running these modules at a lower speed

[1:08:54] Xandorai: the passive perks seem really underwhelming, I'm almost convinced they are just placebo
[1:08:58] Krowely_: They initially wanted to add stats, but now they dont want to since "it's toxic to compare yourself with other players in the lobby"
[1:09:00] christiandart: british empire colorized
[1:09:00] DizzyGunner: they might not add that back, stats can make people toxic
[1:09:14] AcousticID: Maybe the person who does terrible should know they're not good.
[1:09:24] Falxy: @starcommando3 people keep saying that, but I didn't see toxicity from the stats in VT2 once and I played 150 hours
[1:09:25] Krowely_: @DizzyGunner you do realise how dumb that sounds?
[1:09:26] Yxothil: I want more "endless horde" missions :( it got so rare after release
[1:09:30] wummzy: @Mauar think about it like this 3200mhz cl14 is very fast ram so if your ram is 6600 cas28 would be the latency equivalent
[1:09:30] huerans: people too soft for stats now wow
[1:09:36] PorthunaxGaming: Why wouldn't stats just be personal then? If toxic, no need to show other players

[1:11:11] Mauar: @flycosis do you think 6000 c30 ram would perform worse than 7200 c34 ?
[1:11:15] Falxy: @starcommando3 agreed, it was a really cool part of the game and added to the satisfaction after completing a level

[1:11:39] Xandorai: What is the benefit of doing the higher difficulty versions of a mission?
[1:11:41] ShaxArc: @Mauar 0 difference whatsoever 5 fps max
[1:11:49] xNutrients: they could make this game so big by adding other planets with more missions
[1:11:50] Yxothil: You have a thunder hammer in your team
[1:11:51] Falxy: @Xandorai More money and xp
[1:11:53] k4qu: its not about verbal communication, but players selfishly chasing the highscore one the post game screen, playing anti team, just to kill shit before everyone else

[1:12:11] Krowely_: "melee boss"? they just switch to a gun if you all run from it
[1:12:12] ShaxArc: @Mauar and that only sometimes so its not worth gettinf the more expensive 7200
[1:12:14] Xandorai: @Falxy XP and Money both become useless pretty quick though

[1:30:52] Kiwifruit: Ah, does Shrood have the good staff now?
[1:30:59] notfakejay: bolter > plasma
[1:31:01] miguelito420: swap to G to vent
[1:31:02] Gendaif: he can reload to vent
[1:31:03] GABEofNEWCASTLE: @Kiwifruit he's using the best
[1:31:12] kirbies: lightning staff is the best 4+ difficulty
[1:31:16] Xandorai: you can send a ball of void through a horde, its fun
[1:31:25] Wallach: its like a space marine commander plasma pistol
[1:31:34] doobiefreshong: @GABEofNEWCASTLE nah it seems better than what hes using now
[1:31:42] Lionergerand: Yeah voidstaff is for narrow coridor aoe, its not that good vs elites
[1:31:49] hellasketchy_og: this staff is like fire staff in vermintide?
[1:31:55] ChineseDan: Damn it was full released on GP on the 30th...
[1:31:58] Xandorai: oops
[1:31:58] aradim: KEKW
[1:32:01] hellasketchy_og: seems it is
[1:32:03] Mikael_Guintiermo: The chaos!
[1:32:10] ozaare: KEKW
[1:32:13] GABEofNEWCASTLE: someone doesn[t pay attention to the explosion when it colides with terrain
[1:32:16] Gunman_90: BOOM
[1:32:30] GABEofNEWCASTLE: good for clearing out a ton of things. not just narrow areas\
[1:32:43] Kiwifruit: @stiernackenog No, there is a staff that is a flammenwerfer version, but it's not great, the Bolt staff (the one he is using) or the lightning are better
[1:32:52] ThePleasantDoctor: Hey did you see that csgo float has been compromised you go to the webpage and it will max out your cpu, still working it out but looks like it has one of the adverts using your cpu to farm crypto.
[1:33:18] hellasketchy_og: @Kiwifruit was referring to the "overheat" meter
[1:33:24] Phir0s: buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz
[1:33:28] thegrapeapez: Veterans could use Grenade Launchers, and Smaller More portable flamers than a Zealots
[1:33:36] Lionergerand: The explosion is small even when fully charged, its better to use its punch through and shoot through hordes instead of shooting the ground
[1:33:38] Mikael_Guintiermo: This is more like the standard fireball staff. Bolt staff has rapid fire and sniper bolt
[1:33:44] doobiefreshong: yea staggering is huge
[1:33:44] Nikushaa: lightning is the best staff in the game, still not super good tho
[1:33:52] HipOpotamus: Habitually pinging elite enemies is a huge help for everyone, anything strong
[1:33:53] jabawalke_: your mind flay can deal with elites as easily
[1:33:55] aradim: except axe
[1:33:55] kyjul: OMEGALUL

[1:34:18] kyjul: I heard him yell out "Look mom, I'm on TV!" afterwards. LUL
[1:34:20] GABEofNEWCASTLE: there is a great perk for staffs that works well with voidstrike. each weakspot hit quells 3.5% peril.
[1:34:22] Jay_Overdosed: cringe
[1:34:32] Yxothil: Thank god you can mute people ingame

[1:52:21] sonic_bionic: no shrud i went to bang them then when they came over wanting i said no and they got mad
[1:52:23] aradim: Otto thinks he's playing an MMO KEKW
[1:52:24] Blueberrypiie: no thats just shield ogryns gameplay

[1:52:45] Farmeryohn: shield has a secondary, you take no damage from front but cant move
[1:52:46] tranquilseason: I play mid setting havent crashed more then twice today
[1:52:47] IAmPennChan: i dont think he crashed i think he was just holding shield LUL
[1:52:47] JTMonee: shroudH
[1:52:50] Nikushaa: that's just shield ogryns, they have a shield down ability
[1:52:51] Pan_Flute: Ive never had a lobby where anyone crashes kinda weird
[1:52:52] doobiefreshong: @tugginzz based on the gameplay ive seen not really. new classes and darker more gory style
[1:53:20] Yxothil: Otto is aggroing and blocking the enemies with shield. I don't like that playstyle. -1 player on the team for damage
[1:53:41] Gendaif: 2 grim spawn points in this area
[1:53:47] austrianzombie: how many tank classes are in this game ?
[1:53:51] Blueberrypiie: 1
[1:53:53] jdb2727: sucks this isnt crossplay

[1:54:20] tugginzz: @doobiefreshong ill quickly check it out, thanks
[1:54:20] Silly_: does anyone know when crossplay between steam and gamepass is being added?
[1:54:25] RSilveiraa: is this game online or only co-op?
[1:54:26] NeekoThunderleg: @austrianzombie Zealot and ogryn are the tank classes. Zealot when built correctly has more dmg reduction then ogryn.
[1:54:28] Gendaif: 1 grim spawn in the very next room
[1:54:41] jaybee909: does Shroud not know about Warp Charge stacks?
[1:54:47] Nikushaa: vet is a tank vs ranged and zealot works as a tank too, but their primary use is still damage
[1:54:50] bruggggggggggg: inquisition uses prisoners to fight a nurgle infection in the morbian cluster
[1:54:52] austrianzombie: @austrianzombie thanks man
[1:54:53] Mikael_Guintiermo: All we know for crossplay is that they hope to bring it soon

[1:55:21] Plebeian11: Chaos LUL
[1:55:29] DrInuendo: have you tried the lightning staff yet?
[1:55:29] doobiefreshong: ogryn is only really useful in higher difficulty if you spec into heavy attack stuff with mitigation
[1:55:34] NeekoThunderleg: to be fair every role can fill every role aswell. A 4man squad of ogryns can do just as well as a 4 man squad of each role.
[1:55:38] ChineseDan: @bruggggggggggg @Blueberrypiie tyty

[1:56:46] greetnate: oof
[1:57:04] DaksBack: is this game's optimization better than the beta?
[1:57:04] stupid_blessed: how did you fix crashing issue?
[1:57:07] Rionat133: gauntlet is the true chad ogrynn gameplay
[1:57:12] Dandalf_Korwin: That staff is awesome

[1:57:49] Trounzey: Game is just not that hard. Any composition can work even at T5. 4 Zealots will do it a lot faster than everyone else, but any group can do it, just takes more time.

[1:58:26] Blueberrypiie: @Trounzey then just pub 5s

[1:59:00] Mikael_Guintiermo: Game is mainly tough without good Special enemy management
[1:59:19] Mikael_Guintiermo: Also without fundamentals. A lot dont even dodge or push
[1:59:19] Thepothero: This game is too fun ive lost so much time playin this
[1:59:23] Nikushaa: @Trounzey u sure about that? pretty sure you really need someone to clear ranged enemies
[1:59:28] muppetmusician: guns become it when you get 3 perks on them
[1:59:39] Trounzey: @Blueberrypiie No. Unfortunately sometimes the teamwork isn't optimal and that can result in failure. That is correct.

[2:01:10] Mikael_Guintiermo: Funny, I heard flamethrower was nerfed recently
[2:01:27] acehilm_berst: @Mikael_Guintiermo its still really good

[2:02:16] doobiefreshong: how are u crashing so much i have worse specs and havent crashed
[2:02:17] Zurith1030: Might be a server issue, since every day feels worse on the crashes.

[2:03:01] Godwinzx: I haven't crashed at all today
[2:03:02] hylsha: is the sabre psyker only?
[2:03:02] Richroach489: @glasseru because game devs dont care about a complete game anymore from Indie titles to triple A studios
[2:03:12] Blueberrypiie: @Funderik ogryn?
[2:03:12] flatfootsy: @Funderik thats literally warhammer lore what do you mean for no reason LUL
[2:03:16] KodyackGaming: There are some crashes related to woker threads; you can try changing that setting if you're crashing regularly
[2:03:20] stupid_blessed: Crashes apparently have something to do with the Worker Threads setting
[2:03:21] oP_Pie: is there a way to skip prologue?
[2:03:22] hate_xyz: memory leak?
[2:03:26] Ramui7: super memory leak
[2:03:36] Richroach489: @wutru communication of files from RAM to CPU

[2:05:09] koleguy27: is this like zombies ive never played
[2:05:15] KodyackGaming: @KodyackGaming it depends on your system. I've found dropping it by 1 to make things stable in the past, but since full release I've been able to actually increase it by 1 to the maximum and be stable.
[2:05:16] doobiefreshong: i wish they showed a stat screen at the end. This ogryn needs to know how useless he is
[2:05:23] Zurith1030: I'm only level 12 or 13 right now, but is there any real endgame content?
[2:05:32] Richroach489: @Mikael_Guintiermo with a release like this, it would die at $60

[2:07:54] Yakabenko: These enemies are servants of chaos.
[2:08:00] KodyackGaming: @SmokeShow716 I think its worth it personally, but a lot of people will say it's undercooked. It depends fully on if the game appeals to you, as such. If you love L4D, its probably fine.
[2:08:01] Divin3g: is it possible toplay this game only as 2, not a 4 squad?

[2:35:48] nitro_city: @ericswatching exactly
[2:35:50] darkstar421: i believe deluge is the word you ar e looking for
[2:35:52] Yakabenko: You need to come out with me and have a few drinks round some establishments. See the sights and meet some local women. lo.
[2:35:53] namenoonechose: Can this be ran just doing 2 people and not 4?
[2:35:54] dertexd: @Erohw666  I haven't seen one of his valorant streams in a while, that's why I ask, is that a stupid question for you?

[2:36:22] lockxv: @lockxv not what i meant
[2:36:36] Phe0nexius: Is this game like Vermintide?
[2:36:38] koleguy27: minecraft is really starting to look a lot different these days
[2:36:45] bojantottiz: @DayXP Definitely actual state
[2:36:46] Graham2010v2: The spawns are static but have multiple loactions
[2:36:54] bojantottiz: @iamSKOEDIR Yes
[2:36:56] Shred_Alaska: this new runescape patch looks pretty dope
[2:36:58] mydestiny114: is this games combat seem clunky to anyone
[2:37:08] Sketched_sc: @iamSKOEDIR Similar yeah, same dev's.
[2:37:08] BD0NK: @iamSKOEDIR same developers
[2:37:10] ControlWarrior: whats end game looks like besides do random missions
[2:37:13] geniue_ak: NotLikeThis
[2:37:15] TrickModeX: you have to beat the level with the book
[2:37:16] Veeenas: monkaS roar
[2:37:16] Under_Growth: The scripture contract, they only count once you extract with them
[2:37:18] Grim_Dark: @iamSKOEDIR Same devs so yes very similar
[2:37:23] Yakabenko: The combat is rather quite good once you are in the game.
[2:37:24] Godwinzx: you or a teamate has to escape with the scripture for it to count for your weekly
[2:37:31] Gnupper: @5timesbannednewacc its warhammer 40k darktide
[2:37:35] mydestiny114: apex legens ducks
[2:37:46] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[2:38:00] mydestiny114: nobody plays apex for fun they just camp an play toruny style no agressive players
[2:38:00] SidFou: @5timesbannednewacc  UHMM
[2:38:03] nimbo2592: This game is PvE or against actual players?
[2:38:04] Phe0nexius: I don't know anything about the lore of 40k... but is vermintide even connected???
[2:38:05] xcentrickone: Is that Eddie Hall ?
[2:38:09] ericcartman1: catJam
[2:38:10] SpankTank_aGoGo: Warhamburger 40K Calories
[2:38:12] koleguy27: dunethBald
[2:38:22] KalecGenesis: KalecGenesis subscribed with Prime. 
[2:38:24] Yakabenko: Just shourd being very reactionary with his movements.
[2:38:26] LonelyVulpes: @shroud the biggest struggle will be convincing one of the randos to carry out the 3rd scripture once you find it
[2:38:27] Veeenas: HUH
[2:38:34] Graham2010v2: Scriptures have a slight whisper to them when you're near it, its kinda hard to hear sometimes.
[2:38:56] ericswatching: I don't understand. Does he have unlimited ammo? or is that just the class or the weapon? seems OP. I play an ogryn and they suck ass
[2:38:57] Grim_Dark: Damn coomers, always cooming
[2:39:03] SidFou: PepegaAim
[2:39:06] bruggggggggggg: warhammer fantasy and 40k are no longer connected but i think in 2nd or 3rd edition 40k and 4th or 5th edition fantasy, fantasy was a planet in the 40k universe but it was retconned before end times
[2:39:10] mydestiny114: this game look not challengins
[2:39:10] SpankTank_aGoGo: @Graham2010v2 do the grimmys do the same thing?
[2:39:11] NateAlan: i have no ide owhats going on
[2:39:16] Yakabenko: You really don't need this kind of intensity for difficulty 3 on this game lol
[2:39:17] Veeenas: MONKA
[2:39:22] Shred_Alaska: COD zombies bro
[2:39:24] mydestiny114: looks lik easy game
[2:39:27] Aquaphile: PepeLaugh I didn't know the staff had pierce so I was aiming it at the floor
[2:40:03] jax027: What difficulty is this?
[2:40:08] bruggggggggggg: 3
[2:40:15] ericswatching: @mydestiny114 he has unlimited ranged attacks. makes it look easy
[2:40:33] Yakabenko: This makes it look hard.
[2:40:36] Yakabenko: lol
[2:40:36] twitch__noah_: is this a ad
[2:40:38] asmodai_666: i wonder if we will ever fight a chaos space marine in this game
[2:40:40] mydestiny114: @ericswatching ok, but the combat looks clunk too
[2:40:42] koleguy27: should i het this or darkwing
[2:40:46] TheRagingUnicorn: @twitch__noah_ no
[2:40:47] snippy_the_snip: One day I will be shroud sub
[2:40:51] magicvariable74: Slow mode
[2:40:55] TheSwinehawg: this looks sick
[2:41:00] ericswatching: @mydestiny114 try playing it without unlimited ranged attacks. it's horrible
[2:41:06] ExtraterrestrialWizard: game is fun?
[2:41:07] Veeenas: Bruh
[2:41:07] Yakabenko: Thats just me though. Shroud is a far better gamer tha I.
[2:41:15] twitch__noah_: @TheRagingUnicorn thanks
[2:41:16] Noluew: ADS <3
[2:41:16] heavypunisher: !headset
[2:41:16] bruggggggggggg: @ericswatching he has unlimited ammo on cooldown, also ogryn only has 2 viable ranged weapons, grenade glove and heavy stubber
[2:41:17] StreamElements: @heavypunisher, He uses the Logitech Pro X Wireless Lightspeed Gaming Headset, shroud Edition | https://load.gg/Logitech-Shroud (he uses default settings)
[2:41:26] nimbo2592: What ad?
[2:41:27] Veeenas: PepegaAim ADS
[2:41:29] ericswatching: he's not even reloading. it just ranged constantly. how is that possible.
[2:41:47] Graham2010v2: hes basically using spells @ericswatching
[2:41:49] mydestiny114: ever since i played elden ring, other game mechanics all seem clunky
[2:41:50] oP_Pie: games crashed 3 times in 1 run so far
[2:41:53] LonelyVulpes: @ericswatching psyker staves =w=
[2:41:55] SMORC30: <3 beanDance <3
[2:41:56] oP_Pie: any fix?
[2:41:58] vzci: ppL TeaTime
[2:42:01] x3mSlayer: Yo Shrood, how do you feel about switching between melee and ranged often?
[2:42:01] SMORC30: VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo
[2:42:03] Yoshi_hiro: @ericswatching it overheats and he has to quell
[2:42:07] SMORC30: beanSusto PixelBob beanSusto
[2:42:07] bruggggggggggg: it runs off of perils, if it hits 100% he instantly downs
[2:42:11] batdeer1: Yo
[2:42:14] ericswatching: @bruggggggggggg ogryn are garbage. their weapons are trash. you basically just swipe constantly with your melee. or spend half your time reloading
[2:42:28] ashurastar: @oP_Pie lower ur working trents by 2 of ur current settings
[2:42:29] Nikushaa: @bruggggggggggg grenade gauntlet is good

[2:42:53] bruggggggggggg: @nikushaa i love the nade gauntlet
[2:43:04] captcore: !whatevenisthisgame
[2:43:08] Yakabenko: Ogryn are very good. they have plenty of hp to soak up any damage that seeps past their toughness.
[2:43:09] nimbo2592: This is Killing Floor game in Spaceship
[2:43:11] fleshhy: @ericswatching Look at the percentage bar in the middle of his screen. If he really overheated all the way his head would explode and his teammates would have to revive him
[2:43:13] away66: @oP_Pie Drivers update fixed it for me.
[2:43:15] Nikushaa: @bruggggggggggg haven't played ogryn yet but all the ogryns on damnation are using it
[2:43:17] Yakabenko: #
[2:43:18] Sketched_sc: @bruggggggggggg Ogryn is great. The shield is a huge help against mass ranged on higher difficulty, the grenade gauntlet is very good, and the Mk II cleaver with good perks is a mowing machine that makes you almost immortal
[2:43:37] mydestiny114: and all other games bosses seem dum and not complicated, i crave the smart boss games like ghost of tsuk, and elden ring
[2:43:40] Sketched_sc: Mk III*
[2:43:49] bruggggggggggg: ive been using the shovel since its mobility buff but ill need to use the cleaver and try it out tomorrow
[2:44:09] DoubleCrost: SURELY Clueless
[2:44:09] m1gzm: psyker is so bad early on. but once you get staves they're sooooooooo good
[2:44:16] Yxothil: Bridge to other side, then under healing station - is a book spot
[2:44:20] bruggggggggggg: @ericswatching so you want the tankiest class to be a dps as well?
[2:44:29] Yxothil: That one ^^
[2:44:39] Yakabenko: I use whatever I find entertaining.
[2:44:39] Veeenas: HUH
[2:44:45] EdgeLordofGourd: I hate being in a fireteam with ogryn, always blocking my shots. it's a nightmare to have two of them in there
[2:44:49] lawhurt: so does he like this staff more than the other staff
[2:44:51] ashurastar: @oP_Pie if u afk too much and got kick and crash after .best to restart steam .
[2:44:55] drunktechchaser: yup

[2:45:29] Erohw666: difficulty?
[2:45:42] Yakabenko: I have the skill to overcome any shortcomings the weapons may impose. Do you?
[2:46:03] fleshhy: I'm glad they fixed toughness, before pubs were struggling like crazy to beat even difficulty 3
[2:46:11] Yakabenko: Yes. I'm that good.
[2:46:12] LonelyVulpes: @Erohw666 2 or 3 I think
[2:46:23] koonyk2: yes
[2:46:44] Veeenas: Pog
[2:46:44] StalkmaN: I guess that's a problem, shouldn't work like that
[2:46:47] FatStacksFrank: How is this game compared to Vermintide 2 in terms of content? I know it's fun since I played the beta.
[2:46:48] Yxothil: @LonelyVulpes Doesn't he need all 3 books from 3 missions? Would be cool though
[2:46:55] shepsie89: @Yakabenko WeirdChamp
[2:46:56] SteampoweredCid: @Yakabenko we are all tools

[2:47:02] SteampoweredCid: of the machine god
[2:47:10] SteampoweredCid: praise the omnissiah
[2:47:18] LonelyVulpes: @Yxothil his contract is to simply "pick up X number of books" and the game counts books successfully extracted with even if it isn't all 3
[2:47:24] Yakabenko: Simply the best, better than all the rest.
[2:47:30] koleguy27: @yakabenko being an alcoholic is not real confidence
[2:47:37] Yakabenko: Better than you,
[2:47:39] great_gibford: @EdgeLordofGourd cope and seethe small man

[3:06:18] frwdsbckwrds: kill zee scavs
[3:06:18] KilaBeee: i run my games on a toaster
[3:06:20] LilSnoozy96: if you want fps, then you're going to lose quality, Thats just how it is with mid tier hardware. So yes it would be difficult haha
[3:06:21] Born_ChiLLa: @ArcevFPS yepp
[3:06:22] major_o: who's asmongold?
[3:06:22] ThatHomieNano: so is it like set missions or are they random maps and objectives each time
[3:06:22] Kikkadoom: @GI3BO Left for dead style
[3:06:22] Roonab: @GI3BO L4D 40k

[3:06:42] Kikkadoom: @GI3BO Np
[3:06:45] iZadee: @blinkttv_ no its $60
[3:06:45] Under_Growth: @GodTierGameDev After covid and the current economy, it probably is sadly.
[3:06:47] numbnuts55: Fuck it we’ll never know if u do anyway
[3:06:48] flashnickgg: RainbowPls
[3:06:52] bigdawgraider: its $40 on steam and free on Xbox gamepass
[3:06:52] Yxothil: "Traitoria" LUL
[3:06:53] Blazing_Gamez: If you dont have a 2000 or 3000 card, I wouldn't buy this game
[3:07:06] RFTPS3: i play this game fine on a 1060
[3:07:07] StrungFX: I have a 1080ti and it runs fine
[3:07:10] Kikkadoom: @datboyraider sadly not out on consoles yet thouigh
[3:07:14] major_o: my 1080ti runs it easy
[3:07:17] euthanasia_soon_haha: 1070 plays fine

[3:07:31] TheRagingUnicorn: Erohw666 chill
[3:07:36] ItsErmac: runs fine on 4090
[3:07:39] aocAorus: 1080TI is underrated..
[3:07:39] Yxothil: Scriptures in this map are nice to find
[3:07:43] RFTPS3: i also have a i5 2500k and it runs fine
[3:07:47] Yakabenko: Unreal engine 5. Whatever happened to John Carmack. he was pretty much competing with a full unreal dev team all by himself for a good while there lol
[3:07:50] hypnos_xd: !duo
[3:07:50] Fossabot: @hypnos_xd, He's playing with its_WiKeD https://multi.raredrop.co/tshroud/tits_WiKeD
[3:07:51] StrungFX: 8700k running 6 working threads running fine
[3:07:56] EdgeLordofGourd: yes my GPU stays around base temp but it really gets my i7 pretty hot
[3:08:06] Shadowbounty: HUH

[3:08:13] mortalmorto: KEKW
[3:08:14] natevill95: Omg airwrecka_96 is so hot
[3:08:18] hate_xyz: DogChamp
[3:08:19] Chazzoid: @EdgeLordofGourd i7 7700k? what gpu
[3:08:21] GI3BO: @GodTierGameDev it pretty much already is. The average joe can't afford to be dumping 1k (which is a low tier PC nowadays) just to play games for like 8 hours a week
[3:08:35] JeebieBeebies: Ok, Shrood wacky at the this game since last time I saw...
[3:08:35] vishimtar33: my 8090 ti gets 50+ fps at 1080p in this game

[3:08:49] mcdaines: I knew that was the sound!!
[3:08:52] ludex19: LUL
[3:08:55] CorvusANR: movement in this game isn't apex but it's still kinda interesting
[3:09:02] Sketched_sc: @Yakabenko I have (a print of) a John Blanche painting on my wall. Not GW stuff, his own independant work.
[3:09:07] Ejmin123: what is the 4 clicks sound ?
[3:09:17] Grim_Dark: LUL
[3:09:17] y0m0ma: flamer
[3:09:24] koleguy27: runs fine on my rtx 5100
[3:09:28] Failcube: About to fire up the game for the first time since closed beta - how is it?
[3:09:29] aocAorus: 5600x and 1080TI and your absolutely fine on midrange level
[3:09:30] BeefBriskets: @shroud it's supposed to be the sound of a pilot light lighting I think?
[3:09:31] y0m0ma: llike an old oven :)
[3:09:45] GI3BO: @GodTierGameDev it's become absurd, i paid £920 for my 6900 XT from the shop, it's mind boggling
[3:09:48] EdgeLordofGourd: not worth buying a 40xx right now, 30xx series plays most games on Max just fine unless you're super set on 4k
[3:09:48] BR0TH0RITY: Is this game fun? Just got here and I’ve been intrigued by what little I’ve seen so far. Worth the purchase price?
[3:09:49] jaxderas: nice
[3:09:49] y0m0ma: FOR THE EMPEROR
[3:09:53] Born_ChiLLa: wonder how much fps shroud is getting
[3:09:55] Yxothil: Scriptures maybe now, high left or low right
[3:10:11] Grim_Dark: Sounds like my nans old fireplace igniter
[3:10:16] ItsErmac: this game seems violent
[3:10:19] euthanasia_soon_haha: $40 is better than free because you don't play with the awful f2p people tbh
[3:10:34] StreamElements: @Osamasaid12, He uses the Logitech Pro X Wireless Lightspeed Gaming Headset, shroud Edition | https://load.gg/Logitech-Shroud (he uses default settings)
[3:10:37] aocAorus: @BR0TH0RITY if this is your first Warhammer game for sure
[3:10:42] DayXP: nah no violence, they only sleep
[3:10:53] RCascade1996: if i were to get into collecting WH id just be painting them
[3:10:59] AretasTv: I ordered my airbrush for my warhammer 40k introduction

[3:11:06] AretasTv: @shroud
[3:11:07] GI3BO: @GodTierGameDev I'm fortunate enough that I've made money from playing Warzone at a high level so I funded my GPU upgrade and other bits with that money, other's aren't so lucky

[3:11:43] captiankrunk: Idk if flamer is the best name
[3:11:45] Ramui7: gold doesnt share?

[3:12:50] mestophalies: Chat try turing off subtitles
[3:12:57] manicck: whats difficulty is our boy on?
[3:12:59] xRethe: Ragers are meant to be ranged down, there are few melee weapons in the game that stagger them
[3:13:02] bengalbroys: f
[3:13:02] Grim_Dark: "You're not a daemon, you're a very naughty boy, now fackoff"

[3:13:33] PsY_CrO: bro, I run this game on a 1070 and rarely ever get crashs
[3:13:34] artfuldodger1: thought that was my pc

[3:13:36] raynor_90: turn off Ray Tracing @shroud

[3:13:58] Ramui7: gtx cards are running better
[3:13:59] handoekk: turn off dlss and reflex @shroud
[3:14:01] Deadzior: Not a driver update, if it crashes you can turn off raytracing and dlss by editing the CFG file
[3:14:07] RelentlessBugle: It used to crash for me at the end of every mission when my team was about to leave on the dropship and i got nothing 😡

[3:14:38] EdgeLordofGourd: @deadzior they fixed that with yesterday patch
[3:14:43] mortalmorto: restart buff lasts for 1 minute
[3:14:49] LionsCrest: I know sometimes when you use your abilities, there's a chance that you might crash
[3:14:49] Grim_Dark: Mine rarely crashes too, AMD 4800H & Nvidia 2060 RTX laptop, runs fine most the time for me, strange he's having so many issues

[3:17:41] Yakabenko: I am a bit steaming though. lol
[3:17:46] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[3:17:48] Deadzior: @EdgeLordofGourd The thread includes a few tweaks you can make besides that, btw don't call it fixed, when it was simply disabled xD
[3:17:54] Yakabenko: A typical Scottish bloke.
[3:18:06] Ramui7: is this sponsored
[3:18:13] TheRagingUnicorn: @Ramui7 no
[3:18:14] HALCYON9NR: @Ramui7 no this is patrick!

[3:18:37] SasKQuach: SasKQuach subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! less than three
[3:18:47] BadSmellsTV: dead they did a hotfix since it was disabled and nvidia released a new driver so a lot of people had their RTX fixed yesterday
[3:18:51] EdgeLordofGourd: this chat is awfully manageable for 12k people
[3:19:02] Yxothil: LUL
[3:19:06] Roonab: best part about people running ahead is watching them die
[3:19:07] Yakabenko: Shroud is a wee dynamo.
[3:19:18] EdgeLordofGourd: if this were a CSGO stream with this many viewers it would be spammed to death
[3:19:19] Yakabenko: Aye, let them die!
[3:19:30] Yakabenko: The wee buggers.
[3:19:41] Yakabenko: Cheeky buggers.
[3:19:46] Yakabenko: lol
[3:19:56] Roonab: what a wazzok
[3:20:00] Yakabenko: I'll still revive them.
[3:20:09] DayXP: tru cause there's nothing to watch in csgo, here you got all the shiny visuals
[3:20:14] koleguy27: @yakabenko this is your stream
[3:20:15] npc3211: that sword looks cool
[3:20:16] Zamachi: Speaking of enemies, are there any Chaos lesser/greater daemons, or are you just facing these chaos cultists(altho they seem more like zombies)
[3:20:33] kurib: the elite special in this game is scary af
[3:20:34] Deadzior: @Zamachi There's a daemon host :D
[3:20:41] EdgeLordofGourd: I love watching CSGO man, I'm addicted to that game going on 20 years
[3:20:43] Yxothil: Search up there everywhere
[3:20:45] 2piecenuggs: SMOrc ?

[3:21:02] xreoze: Is this game only on pc and if not does it even run good on console
[3:21:03] Yakabenko: @koleguy27 Nah. I'm just drunk. I get all chatty when I'm drunk lol
[3:21:11] Roonab: @hmtuff nurgle

[3:21:29] kaboos101: hopefully no one gets whipped into the abyss by its tail :O
[3:21:41] EdgeLordofGourd: I don't think it's out on console yet, I dno haven't turned in my series x in months
[3:21:42] Yakabenko: I'm not a nasty drunk though. :)
[3:21:54] Mog_Knight: you can brain burst at 95% and you'll be fine and you can quell to 95% and use it again without killing yourself
[3:21:57] strorrm: the abilities dont look like they do dmg lol
[3:22:04] Yakabenko: So don't you worry your wee cotton socks.
[3:22:05] frwdsbckwrds: @EdgeLordofGourd throw it away
[3:22:18] Shadowbounty: modCheck
[3:22:20] Born_ChiLLa: I saw a 100% couple times but he didn't blow up?
[3:22:20] CommanderTrip: is this game fun as a solo?
[3:22:32] nasirum: dodgeeee
[3:22:33] cannabiscuresall: Yea for a spell caster your spells kinda lack ooomf
[3:22:44] xreoze: Series x better than PS5
[3:22:49] Under_Growth: @CommanderTrip You can't really play solo right now, you will matchmake into 3 other players
[3:22:51] regularlyunderperforming: @mediterranean_7 only die if you start it above 97%  not if you reach 100
[3:22:58] EdgeLordofGourd: lol, nah man imma play it eventually, prolly for starfield.  I love being lazy laying in bed rather than up at my desk
[3:22:59] norththree: Is darktide worth getting or does it feel repetitive?
[3:23:04] HouseOfPaincake: @hmtuff modCheck
[3:23:09] Born_ChiLLa: @regularlyunderperforming ok thank you
[3:23:11] Yakabenko: Mind you I did get a bottle smashed across my face not long ago. Broke my nose lol. I did forgive the bloke who did it. I don't hold grudges.
[3:23:15] Pandishi: Hey Shroud you get your Twitch Drops skins? it seems like even a month later the vast majority of players are having issues claiming them in-game.
[3:23:15] Rewdawakening: @norththree Give it a couple of months
[3:23:20] CommanderTrip: @CommanderTrip yea, so what I mean is it still fun with randoms? i normally hate that kind of stuff
[3:23:24] BrotherHas: How much better is this than new world scale 1-10
[3:23:28] euthanasia_soon_haha: @mediterranean_7 you get a grace period that varies by weapon/ability, you can start brain burst at 95 and not blow up
[3:23:39] xreoze: @houseofpaincake Problem?
[3:23:40] ErronDonDon: Is this better than Vermintide2?
[3:23:41] EdgeLordofGourd: @norththree it is rather repetitive but they usually put out loads of content for their games
[3:23:42] Evilreapers: @SoleHAS not the same game for comparison
[3:23:43] paracosm501st: Make sure to check that back area for scriptures
[3:23:57] Scitalis__: @SoleHAS 6.9
[3:23:57] Evilreapers: @ErronDonDon ranged focused
[3:23:58] HALCYON9NR: @SoleHAS i rate it hamburger out of tacos
[3:23:58] paracosm501st: Back in the circle area
[3:23:58] Yakabenko: My nose is a bit squint now lol
[3:23:59] Makaveligz: @SoleHAS is not even the same genre
[3:23:59] sthingz: Playing solo is still fun but you need to know the warhammer 40k lore. Otherwise, if you are just playing the game for the FPS aspect of it, then playing co-op is way more fun
[3:24:03] 0_0bvious: @norththree maybe wanna get the xbox game pass if your unsure
[3:24:08] MajorGamerGeek: I don’t understand why this game is bugged and not others
[3:24:15] JBobbby: has warhammer always been like this gamepay? I've never heard this game ever
[3:24:16] 006ickness: @shroud you're not watching twitch you are twitch
[3:24:17] HALCYON9NR: @SoleHAS my rating is not relevant like your comparison
[3:24:25] rocketsnail22: !drops
[3:24:32] DayXP: i'm curious. which game is not bugged?
[3:24:33] rocketsnail22: !drop
[3:24:36] sthingz: @JBobbby nope. the have some godawful games out there. The latest one are pretty neat
[3:24:44] Pandishi: They privated the FAQ page about it after their recent Tweet promoting it, it's their atomaDotcloud site is wonky or something, they broke it a day after they put it up
[3:24:55] EdgeLordofGourd: @majorgamergeek because it's in it's first week, what game these days doesn't come out a broken shell of a game
[3:24:56] arked9: @JBobbby Nah There are a lot of warhammer games. Lot of bad and good
[3:25:06] lukica777: Is it shrud or shrod?
[3:25:07] Pandishi: @JBobbby it's a Tabletop game, then was mostly RTS titles.
[3:25:08] thesaxnumber: @JBobbby Kinda. Vermintide and Space Hulk almost have the same mechanics...
[3:25:16] Yxothil: Zealots are you tanks
[3:25:24] Yakabenko: @arked9 This is one of the better ones.
[3:25:26] IAmPennChan: ehhh kind of
[3:25:27] tea_punk: @JBobbby Some of the best ones were RTS, the first 40k was as fun as Starcraft or Red Alert
[3:25:27] androidalien: gamesworkshop sell the ip to anyone that wants to make a game
[3:25:30] CommanderTrip: @EdgeLordofGourd it sucks that that is the norm :(
[3:25:31] Logan_Grim: Zealot stun grenades soo good for high diff missions
[3:25:37] JBobbby: any warhammer game.wortg buying? I hear alot about warhammer this and that.
[3:25:44] arked9: @Yakabenko big true
[3:25:52] Ya_Boi_Jelly: @JBobbby dawn of war 2 >
[3:25:53] JBobbby: game worth buying*
[3:26:08] DomaNuub: Do you hoard materials or is it instanced loot?
[3:26:09] tea_punk: Yeah the first and second Dawn of War, 3 fell off
[3:26:12] Yakabenko: @arked9 You know it my dude :)
[3:26:12] stinkIoI: this game feels like its still in beta
[3:26:18] kurib: if you enjoy what you are seeing, over and over again, its pretty fun
[3:26:24] thesaxnumber: @JBobbby The Dawn of War series is pretty neat
[3:26:24] Pandishi: @JBobbby Warhammer and not 40K? the total war games are pretty decent if you like that, but this fps there's only Vermintide for warhammer
[3:26:27] kurib: then it is worth
[3:26:28] MrStrothmann: no game releases complete anymore
[3:26:31] EdgeLordofGourd: @commandertrip yea I'm 35, I remember when dlc was actual expansion packs adding at least 50 percent more content and games were in beta for a couple years to have an actual polished complete product
[3:26:37] SlippnGriff: what's your crouch bound to?
[3:26:38] Yakabenko: @corndogRx Well then theres room for improvement.
[3:26:41] nyareal: mats are split with team at end
[3:26:43] CptNoMercy: materials are shared
[3:26:43] Evilreapers: @JBobbby its 40usd i'd say its a decent buy compare to a lot of games out atm as a multiplayer service
[3:26:44] Logan_Grim: @DomaNuub Everyone gets the materials looted in the mission
[3:26:46] Sketched_sc: @JBobbby Depends on what sort of games you enjoy, this and vermintide 2 are great, the 1st 2 total war warhammer games are great too if you like stratagy games.
[3:26:47] Roonab: the plasteel and diamantine are shared
[3:26:50] irishrovergaming: @DomaNuub you buy access to gear in an armoury and can equip between missions
[3:26:51] TrickModeX: Upgrade materials are not individual
[3:26:55] arked9: @corndogRx Bruh beta had some seriouse memes LUL check out some clips over the past month
[3:26:56] koleguy27: should. i buy darkwing or this
[3:27:02] Deadzior: @nyareal It's not split, everyone gets the same value after the pickup.
[3:27:06] dunkin_m: How come nobody ever plays the tank class
[3:27:19] Yakabenko: These are one of the golden child developers for warhammer tbh.
[3:27:23] EdgeLordofGourd: bruh no, don't encourage more ogryn they're obnoxious
[3:27:31] abaraba_: you just passed a med station
[3:27:35] Sketched_sc: @JBobbby Dawn of War 1 and 2 were good too, but are dead now.
[3:27:46] kaboos101: i find its good to do the grim missions to learn all the scripture spots they spawn in the same place but the grims glow

[3:28:04] muppetmusician: dawn of war 2 elite mod multiplayer is super fun though and still well alive
[3:28:06] Pandishi: The ammo, grenades, health and ammo packs are all first come, but it's neat that the Crafting mats you find are all shared so it prevents loot goblins!
[3:28:11] EdgeLordofGourd: constantly in the way blocking shots, if you get in a team with two of them you might as well just melee the entire match
[3:28:17] xreoze: LOL this game ain’t even on PS5 once again Microsoft W🤫
[3:28:30] Yakabenko: Ogryn are the bestest in the universe, ever and ever.
[3:28:35] xreoze: aint*
[3:28:38] Sketched_sc: @dunkin_m Just need to give a little tought to your positioning

[3:29:45] EdgeLordofGourd: ight, imma lurk for the drops I got UFC fights to watch
[3:29:45] dunkin_m: Ahhh k. I'm guessing most ogryn players just rush forward without thinking

[3:30:19] Yakabenko: Ogryn pick me up in their strong arms and carry me through all the chaos baddies.
[3:30:26] Deadzior: blocks health regen until you visit a medicae station, or get killed.
[3:30:30] Sketched_sc: @xNutrients Shoving them works better, but still feels a bit janky
[3:30:31] Shadowbounty: @Yakabenko PotFriend do this IRL
[3:30:35] Rayeloy: @JBobbby no idea what you just said
[3:30:35] EdgeLordofGourd: @hyotamelol it's corrupted, you can get it back from healing station but it's gone til then
