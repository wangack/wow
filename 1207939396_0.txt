[1:14:56] Zakali: @Towelliee  Its not really the horde hogger. Horde hogger is the cave near ogrimmar with the Fire Blade warlock. :P Thats where many ironman people will die...
[1:15:02] Zakali: Its the prequest for chasm
[1:15:26] Sollice: better to shut it down for a few days and fix the backend or whatever they need than to constantly let these things come up and basically break the game.
[1:15:47] parad12e: daddyJump
[1:15:55] Day_Walker78: thay are enabling wealth transfers today again in New World
[1:15:59] Sollice: that is until they announce that and players go bat shit crazy
[1:16:22] CrusaderNero: it might be that a few days wont be enough
[1:17:02] parad12e: for what game ?
[1:17:03] CrusaderNero: sadly, no MMORPG comes close to wow. Maybe FF14 right now, but wow is still up there
[1:17:35] maldgoat: is this a non pvp server?
[1:17:38] rodomenr: Love you man, it is hot wherever u are?

[1:19:31] PadidinJones: Looking for group is messed up
[1:19:54] easy_wheezy: humanoid mobs always harder
[1:20:13] PadidinJones: I mean you can list yourself but for some reason you appear as lvl 1
[1:20:14] Herzenliegen: When you have to go down into the crypt that's when it gets fun. Those mobs group up
[1:20:26] FleuryGG: the crypt in this area is a, no pun intended, death trap, be careful
[1:20:37] Kromede: strafe away
[1:20:48] Herzenliegen: @fleurygg right!
[1:21:05] parad12e: are you doing this all solo or you got a group ?

[1:23:24] easy_wheezy: so what happens if you die? character gets deleted? or is there a debuff or something?
[1:23:27] NewWorldReign: buy a upgraded computer, not the companies problem if you crash during a run

[1:23:58] LawnSpeaker: I don't have good enough internet to play any online hardcore mode
[1:24:11] KelvoranGaming: You can disable the debuff at the NPC, but you can never take up the Soul of Iron again on that character @Towelliee
[1:24:14] easy_wheezy: so undead for canibalism and water breathing?/
[1:24:15] Sollice: what does your computer have to do with a DC lol
[1:24:33] LawnSpeaker: @MyriaK you mean the proim minista?

[1:24:40] isakdhik: I must have died over 100 times leveling my warrior to 60 in classic. how you are going to do this without dying is beyond me
[1:24:43] Xender21: undead priest have devouring plague still?
[1:25:09] Ortinoth: @Impreg Generally with warrior you got to farm yellow and green mobs, nothing higher

[1:26:18] Tharia: STV was my graveyard lol... damn panthers
[1:26:45] Xender21: rank 1 frostbolt kite
[1:26:46] shale93: I dont care about classic at all anymore but the ironman gets me interested just to see If I can do it, tho its less challenging if there is exp boost
[1:27:17] timmythegamertv: Is Towel meant to have BS up? LUL
[1:27:38] Ortinoth: i remember from my classic days aggroing a mob then running half accross the map to break that aggro
[1:27:46] yulelogged: I already died 2 times on my rogue haha
[1:28:13] Herzenliegen: @verizon_engineer The mobs still hit hard so death is still easy to come by even with XP boost
[1:28:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: true, gotta be a bit of a rogue in Classic, being warrior
[1:28:34] chinfu303: gordo more like chado

[1:36:00] CaptNeemo: You think its gunna be race for Ungoro again?
[1:36:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Could be
[1:36:03] KelvoranGaming: Yeah I've got more than a few friends who haven't touched some starting zones. I don't think I ever really levelled in Teldrassil during Classic. Everyone was talking about how Elwynn was the place to be and how Night Elves had to do the Menethil run, hard no from me.
[1:36:13] Corparative: they really shouldve made joining the scarlet crusade an option in wow
[1:36:19] o__mj__o: @Towelliee what was ur class and race in vanilla wow?

[1:37:07] Shrenko: @NewWorldReign it started last night....
[1:37:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: loll
[1:37:29] KelvoranGaming: You know, it's probably good that they didn't put Iron Man NPCs in every starting zone. Can you imagine how many salty players there would be if they started Iron Man, then went on the Menethil run? XD
[1:37:38] king_julian_96: towelliee would you be happy with another world revamp in 10.0
[1:37:39] Tharia: LUL
[1:37:41] CaptNeemo: I was thinking about skinning the big raptors, but maybe thats old

[1:38:29] Powahfull: @kelvorangaming  if you did before getting the buff then you can never get the buff they coded it so u can't cheese ironman
[1:38:34] Silver_Lion: what a mad lad
[1:38:35] LawnSpeaker: @king_julian_96 the world is like the one thing they don't need to revamp
[1:38:36] soundzGOOD: monkaS every pull bigger than 1 mob
[1:38:37] Xender21: 2 mobs every time canibalism is up
[1:39:08] mateolaa: time for towel to buy some black air forces
[1:39:30] CaptNeemo: No pocket healer from chat either? :P
[1:39:37] sifer007: i want mop classic :(
[1:39:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm hoping the new zones are pretty big, they looked good to me

[1:41:20] sifer007: KEKW
[1:41:27] soundzGOOD: its like unlocking covenant sactums
[1:41:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it sounds like a gating, but it's mysterious
[1:41:37] dracullus: but it should be completely account wide
[1:41:39] TopLegend123: wow Hardcore? bfdMos bfdMos
[1:41:41] Tharia: do professions give xp in classic? don't remember
[1:41:43] Ezekyler: timegating language KEKW

[1:43:56] Gingerprimer: If it is around the Size of Nazjatar I am happy I think that was the perfect size for a patch zone
[1:43:58] Rizec: the feed back was soo overwhelmingly negativ they would realy go against everything they said if they do dom slots agains
[1:43:59] KelvoranGaming: Speaking of raid changes, as I said earlier, loving the changes they're making to MC. I think Magmadar is going to be a challenge for folks.
[1:43:59] soundzGOOD: im definetly in need of some domination Kreygasm  keep your resistance anduin small boy Kreygasm
[1:44:25] Silver_Lion: @soundzGOOD WTFF

[2:02:21] Kyrrua: im no hardcore advocate just asking if u were doing the challenge
[2:02:40] Gingerprimer: Playing games for fun what is this heresy
[2:02:53] Kyrrua: I think its too much and waste of time imo (unless streamer or jobless)
[2:02:54] NewWorldReign: imagine being a hardcore char in a a raid dungeon "HEAL! I DONT WANT TO START AGAIN"
[2:02:56] Snowd3n: but ur life is playing video games
[2:03:09] king_julian_96: I mean I died and I’m still leveling

[2:04:36] easy_wheezy: if you want to kill rag you need to dungeon farm for gear and thats when you die
[2:05:16] Kyrrua: race for ragnaros hardcore seems like pain
[2:05:31] Remsa: where did you get that buff ?
[2:05:55] infantry10th: i dont have it for some reason?
[2:06:20] Kyrrua: I think theres a hardcore race for this
[2:06:27] GOROTHIA: ppl are gonna die while farming gear
[2:06:32] Day_Walker78: need to talk to a npc to get the buff
[2:06:43] KelvoranGaming: Yep, more adds and more mechanics on some of them.
[2:06:53] clearscreen: shaz is different too
[2:07:08] KelvoranGaming: Shazzrah for example when he blinks will spawn an Image of Shazzrah that spams Arcane Explosion for the rest of the fight.
[2:07:22] RagingPunk: some green 2handers are going for a few silver which is nice
[2:07:50] KelvoranGaming: I'm really interested to see how BWL will change.
[2:07:54] Alepouditsa: isn't crafting items beter?
[2:08:15] KelvoranGaming: Like, I wonder how they're going to change the Vael fight.
[2:08:18] Alepouditsa: ohh
[2:08:35] KelvoranGaming: Or Razorgore... ffs that'll be a nightmare.
[2:09:05] snoopdoge__: why is everyone making a new char
[2:09:06] king_julian_96: Will dungeon bosses be harder to
[2:09:19] KelvoranGaming: I don't think they've changed dungeon bosses.

[2:38:17] Dolco: Does the leveling feel faster with 40% increase to quest turn-ins?
[2:38:47] Sarocus: @dolco That's just for elites, afaik
[2:39:01] PaHaW: Can anyone give the addon settings weakaurus towelliee?
[2:39:25] Criticalsnap: i quit at 45, so repetitive doing the same thing over and over

[2:39:33] Sarocus: I still have good hopes for New World. They just need time to get it in shape
[2:39:35] Zakali: Its super repetative.
[2:39:38] AdaahL: did you play lost ark_

[2:41:06] obbi87: @Towelliee Seen the rumor that lost ark will release January 11th ?
[2:41:08] soth_klf: I really like Lost Ark, played it for the first time during the Beta and it was really amazing
[2:41:35] ragectl: that is true too
[2:42:36] BlewGamingGroup: theres so much content already in lost ark
[2:42:41] DonSmash: lost ark looks like shit
[2:42:45] captiv8: its literally like diablo
[2:42:52] Sarocus: But but..isometric!
[2:42:53] Gingerprimer: And also Lost Ark has like 3 years worth of content
[2:42:57] DonSmash: just another diablo with other skins
[2:42:59] soth_klf: the levling is quite repetitive too which is a downside in the early levels
[2:43:17] Criticalsnap: I feel like most people got tired of it around level 30 tho @Herzenliegen

[2:48:13] Criticalsnap: yes
[2:48:14] Silver_Lion: yes
[2:48:16] CurlyFriass: yea if you make room
[2:48:28] ragectl: as long as you dont take damage you can
[2:48:28] KelvoranGaming: You can, but the moment you get hit, the bandage gets interrupted.
[2:48:34] ragectl: dont move dont take damage
[2:48:53] infantry10th: yes
[2:49:19] KelvoranGaming: Leeeeroooooy

[2:50:49] ragectl: gg
[2:51:38] ragectl: might be ElvUI bug
[2:52:11] infantry10th: yeah maybe
[2:52:51] Criticalsnap: the murlocs there aren't really that bad
[2:52:53] ragectl: murlocghcruruhlrlgrgrglrlggg
[2:53:00] Criticalsnap: compared to elwynn
[2:53:02] ragectl: that funny noise they make
[2:53:22] Flippyyz: was just watching Formal wreck in Infinite
[2:53:41] Eutopia: Halo Infinite is really bad, 3 lane call of duty maps. With uninspiring mechanics. If it was good people would watch
[2:53:43] WoW_StandalonE: CSGO
[2:54:14] killswiitch: killswiitch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 57 months! 
[2:54:24] Eutopia: But this Halo is extremely closed in, no sandbox style maps like the OGs. IE Halo 3
[2:54:27] killswiitch: I loved halo
[2:55:02] stressley89: still like Halo over CoD and BF
[2:55:24] ragectl: BF is kinda good but the new game is a bit buggy
[2:55:26] WoW_StandalonE: BF is more casual and fun imo
[2:55:48] DuploThief: i have quit all shooters too much stress for me
[2:55:53] ragectl: sniping feels more valuable in BF games because of the bigger maps and bullet drop on snipers
[2:56:02] Triknives: Hazard Mode is great.
[2:56:10] funKShun: that's why there was TDM infantry only in past BF's not anymore

[2:56:29] ragectl: the little man chopper needs a nerf limit the number of flares it can fire
[2:56:33] faeldan: Assist XP needs to go away too
[2:56:40] Eutopia: It just doesnt feel like halo, it feels like CoD. And I would just go play that then

[2:57:43] fewyn: fewyn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months, currently on a 25 month streak! towHAMUP
[2:57:45] ragectl: Halo is more like Destiny but with less to do
[2:57:56] ragectl: it's a very floaty feeling game
[2:58:07] Flippyyz: considering Destiny is made by Bungie, the original halo creators...
[2:58:23] pereadin: pereadin subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 51 months! 51 yearssssss! Good to see you back on WoW bro!
[2:58:42] Syllvn: It's an arena shooter at heart, build off things like Quake and such
[2:59:02] Eutopia: Fair enough, I just think viewership and steam numbers reflect it not being very good. Especially for it just launching
[2:59:09] pereadin: Is this SoM?
[2:59:39] Moobot: Type with English letters please PaHaW
[3:00:00] Syllvn: @Eutopia Dont forget it's on Gamepass, Steam isn't the sole place for the game, or even the main place
[3:00:36] pereadin: Halo is older than me im p sure KEKW
[3:00:37] Flippyyz: Halo 1 was like 2004ish
[3:00:45] fewyn: i remember playing halo in a friends basement in high school back in 2002/2003
[3:00:50] pereadin: @EkohPlaysGames nevermind then lmao
[3:01:01] pereadin: was 11 years off on thatt one
[3:01:02] TheUnknowing: halo 1 was 2001
[3:01:29] TheUnknowing: November 15th, 2001.
[3:01:34] flyingmachin3: make sure to get your coarse thread
[3:01:44] Syllvn: Halo peaked at 250k players on Steam in the last 24 hours. putting it at #4 played on Steam
[3:01:45] juga27: hey man hows it going? :)
[3:01:51] Eutopia: @Eutopia True, I still think twitch is pretty accurate with overall player numbers. Which could be taken out of context. But for halo launching and barely topping 100k viewers. I think thats saying something
[3:02:16] schneid4: nades are brutal

[3:02:42] Ortinoth: @Eutopia viewers maybe but not neccesarry players as those numbers often do not represent one another
[3:02:48] Syllvn: Twitch does not equal success of a game, look at FFXIV pre the boom
[3:02:58] Flippyyz: i love how the nades are timed off the first time they bounce
[3:03:23] mistakebythelake90: meh, halo was one of the first games to have the recharge shield, true boomer games are like cs 1.6 and other twitch games
[3:03:30] funKShun: never played HALO until yesterday, played for 2 hours and got bored, and I've played Unreal Tournament and Quake 1 when I was a kid, but Halo feels so slow ...
[3:03:41] Oakengrove: Is this his second character?
[3:03:50] MaxedLuck_: kinda let down they didnt add like a single significant thing to the new halo br. like cmon. new weapons? attachments? grenades? vehicles? anything?? talk about minimal investment
[3:04:01] funKShun: And the guns are kinda bad imo, they do not feel impactful
[3:04:11] Lux_Savage: Wait are there seasonal characters on WoW now? This looks fun
[3:04:43] MaxedLuck_: @Lux_savage ye its mostly the same thing, little bit more xp from quests, and some added difficulty mods in raids
[3:04:48] Thunderbrew: @Lux_savage What is a seasonal character?
[3:04:54] stressley89: 8k on swtor most of time on steam
[3:04:56] rosina_scarlett: SWTOR has 3745 in game on steam
[3:05:03] Azathul: HC mode like you die you delete the character?
[3:05:03] rosina_scarlett: right now
[3:05:07] rosina_scarlett: @Azathul yes
[3:05:38] MaxedLuck_: @masumi_scarlett its also 6am american time and a weekday, think he meant most of the time as in usual gaming hours
[3:05:41] dashzombie: tomorrow i think
[3:05:45] Oakengrove: Has he died yet?
[3:05:47] rosina_scarlett: Tera on steam rn has 334 people in game
[3:05:55] Azathul: imagine if they made a full PvP hardcore mode server.....
[3:05:59] rosina_scarlett: @ReaperRaey yeah
[3:06:28] anythingl0lz: Ive heard that wow has some very different things coming in 10.0 :^) @Towelliee
[3:06:43] rosina_scarlett: Yeah it has 3745 right now
[3:07:12] rosina_scarlett: SWTOR is amazing
[3:07:23] Flippyyz: i feel like the LOTR MMO is underrated as well
[3:07:29] rosina_scarlett: Tera is also amazing. they just reuse content to much and it gets boring af
[3:07:47] sibuhan: hello towelliee   are you back to new word ?
[3:08:17] fewyn: i kind of wish i stuck with star wars and actually raided
[3:08:25] Xenial70: if I wasn't playing d2R, i would be playing starwars
[3:08:34] juga27: i didnt really like new world tbh

[3:19:59] amricatt: Yeah, they are a different breed.  My husband is a diesal mechanic and has to deal with them.
[3:20:14] Jakmuiz: truck drivers feel pressured since their logs are electronic and every minute is tracked by law.

[3:20:45] disarmin: THE POLE ASKED FOR IT
[3:20:45] adrian_fell: i'll never forget my driving instructor telling us that everyone in the room will crash at least once in their life
[3:20:47] templarofboingo: The Nevada police are now in the chat 👀
[3:20:47] Sarocus: @Jakmuiz Tachographs aren't used in the U.S, though. It's an Eu thing
[3:21:02] YetiGamingTV: Isn’t that technically a crash?
[3:21:09] LSBreed: We were on a family vacation once, and a truck driver pushed us into an emergency stopping lane going down the side of a mountain.
[3:21:40] dashzombie: O.o

[3:22:33] templarofboingo: The pole was a real stand up guy
[3:22:35] eaglerydr: later he sued you for reckless driving
[3:22:42] YetiGamingTV: Who was at fault? @towelliee
[3:22:45] BlewGamingGroup: gave em 5 bucks for the chipped paint and called it a day
[3:22:56] sori88: @Towelliee warrior HC mode? They made a HC mode for WoW (like Diablo 2)?

[3:38:46] Oviedange: provides more content. @srcakz  lol. How many times does the world need to wipe to Bobby before defeating that boss? :p
[3:38:48] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Solarwuf (warning)
[3:38:48] Oakengrove: You get so much renown now!
[3:38:52] pereadin: i actually just got done healing a 21 NW
[3:38:55] mezza77: What’s going on at blizzard has nothing to do with my enjoyment in playing WoW so I continue to play it
[3:39:06] pereadin: @mezza77 thats what im sayin
[3:39:16] srcakz: I'm looking forward to lost ark and wow mastery is cool because of ironman now
[3:39:26] Bugszy: @mezza77 agree bro
[3:39:28] Demanisraar: @mezza77 true

[3:39:49] m0rith: m0rith subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[3:39:56] tyrel_jones: The Mills were always my favorite part of Tirisfal Glades @towelliee
[3:39:59] pereadin: I feel for the victims, ya.  But it won't affect whether or not I play.
[3:40:08] Tighron: 2%
[3:40:09] Gingerprimer: Most ppl also have no idea this is even happening
[3:40:10] Demanisraar: very low
[3:40:12] FlZZlX: less than that
[3:40:14] Etsku: why would i cancel a game for what goes on in the company ... do you think all the food companies that you buy food from arent doing bullshit
[3:40:15] KaisenSiru: Who?
[3:40:16] OldManPetersen: Thats the owner of Tencent right
[3:40:17] Heracy: my view is there is a lot of good people that work there that aren't involved in this stuff and are just as upset
[3:40:22] Gingerprimer: maybe 20% at best
[3:40:22] burning2bright: I got my own things to care about. cant be bothered with thinking about others shiet :)
[3:40:23] PokerFaceMoose: addiction is more powerful than other things.
[3:40:24] Bahamut145: way less then 50/50
[3:40:25] Wcvechten: most people just log on and play to escape all that shit in the world afterall
[3:40:27] Juzzieee: @fourteenfour that's what i did, I just resubbed after 4 months because there was nothing to do
[3:40:29] xXSiebzehnXx: Not even
[3:40:30] GiraffeHydra_: I'd be amazed if 50% knew
[3:40:32] Gragnar: for a lot of people, WoW is their escape
[3:40:35] Azathul: We wouldnt have shit to do if everyone stopped using products when companies had drama
[3:40:37] brokenjester: i dont like whats happening there, i just dont see how quitting changes any of that stuff.  them losing my sub money is really going to make a difference?
[3:40:38] tyrel_jones: Like 5-10% care i bet
[3:40:40] pereadin: agreed!
[3:40:41] Spaede: The people that quit because of Kotick are probably extremely small. You can see them all posting on Reddit daily about it lol
[3:40:42] GODZILR1: got too many of my own problems to worry about that shit
[3:40:44] ohnot___her: Can you blame them for that tho?
[3:40:49] pereadin: 9.2 looks promising too
[3:40:58] Oakengrove: Any idea how long we got before 9.2? Recently came back and trying to get KSM BloodTrail
[3:40:59] srcakz: facts, always vocal minority are the loudest.
[3:41:01] LordKain73: I feel sorry for the victims...so let's make them homeless by cutting off their source of income.
[3:41:04] DigitalChill: its like running around in new world saying 'bezos this and bezos that'
[3:41:09] pereadin: @Oakengrove Feb 2022
[3:41:11] Kyrioz: ive played wow since beta, the game and people have gotten me through some serious dark times, the shit going on is sad and should be dealt with but i enjoy the game
[3:41:30] Gingerprimer: @Spaede like most ppl have not a single idea that this is even happening
[3:41:35] Oakengrove: @pereadin Cheers!
[3:41:45] conul: @Gingerprimer whats happening? just came on
[3:41:45] srcakz: yep, if you work retail it's the same thing. people always feeling underappreciated but you can always just quit
[3:41:46] geraldar8: @LordKain73 Exactly, you nail it...  That's why I still play it.
[3:41:58] Herzenliegen: 6-7 believe
[3:41:59] Functionalidiot: yes
[3:42:09] amricatt: As a woman, I can honestly say that unfortunately there is harrassment and not equality in pay, etc. everywhere. If everyone boycotted all the companies, there would be nothing.
[3:42:16] luckfore: its good to be aware of whats happening but people stay should enjoy the game they pay for
[3:42:16] Functionalidiot: its at the end in that one room
[3:42:29] amricatt: I'm glad it came to light so Blizzard could do better.
[3:42:47] Gingerprimer: @conul Booby knew about/hushed down the Sexual assault/horrsament stuff
[3:42:53] srcakz: agreed amricatt jobs have been like this since forever. people just don't care if the service is good
[3:43:03] ggkhs: When I was playing WoW most of the people wouldn't even read the patch notes or realize a patch is out so I doubt they are caught up on this topic.
[3:43:12] Kyrioz: @Towelliee i found WoW after TFC took a shit so lol
[3:43:14] Buttscratchrr: their nothing else to play really
[3:43:14] Herzenliegen: I take a break every expansion
[3:43:20] srcakz: but since wow isn't so hot rn people just piling on top
[3:43:25] PvtHudson093: yup
[3:43:29] conul: so nothing happened out of the walkout?
[3:43:39] srcakz: it's the only MMORPG
[3:43:44] Amiriel: wow at top? uff
[3:43:45] Spaede: The woke police… making sure NO ONE is doing the thing they recently quit doing
[3:43:48] ArcaneSyntax: its especially bad in gaming companies, like none of them are free from sin. Riot, ubisoft and now Activision.
[3:43:52] Gingerprimer: Yesterdays there was one
[3:43:54] pereadin: Its just so hard to find people to play with nowadays
[3:43:55] Functionalidiot: there is a walkout planned for today
[3:44:07] TanteTrude: apparently the whole board of execs has to go for that to happen
[3:44:07] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:44:07] Oakengrove: You think Ion should step down as lead designer?
[3:44:08] conul: there was also yesterday ?
[3:44:10] Functionalidiot: 100 ppl started yesterday afternoon
[3:44:15] luckfore: i dont think boby is going anywhere
[3:44:16] Juzzieee: WoW is the only MMO that is a worldwide MMO, other MMOs exist but only have specific reigons
[3:44:18] Oviedange: Walkout was yesterday, demanding bobby sets down.
[3:44:23] Oviedange: steps*
[3:44:23] crashoverride_gaming: I’d love to play any damn game today….but no, I get to put up a shit ton of Christmas lights outside towCry
[3:44:33] PvtHudson093: God dammit Bobby
[3:44:35] ZyntosAran: @Juzzieee what?
[3:44:39] Azathul: no corporation is innocent of some kind of shady shit
[3:44:39] srcakz: people should just let the courts and the people wronged at Activision handle their business, no need to be so vocal if you're not involved directly
[3:44:40] conul: no one playing low level zones 1 day after launch >????
[3:44:46] ZyntosAran: @Juzzieee ff14 is also available everywhere
[3:44:47] Juzzieee: @noon33ver other MMOs exist, but usually only have EU or NA servers
[3:44:47] Gingerprimer: And also the rest of activison is still going strong with big succes with cod and moblie games
[3:44:57] pereadin: @Towelliee what stipulates the hardcore restrictions you gave yourself?
[3:45:12] conul: yea the crypt is not fun if you die
[3:45:13] BlewGamingGroup: all them up and coming bots
[3:45:16] Juzzieee: @noon33ver not everywhere, not yet anyway
[3:45:28] Azathul: "Can anyone come help me"...... "Fuck you bro im not dying"
[3:45:29] pereadin: "/join world"
[3:45:33] Buttscratchrr: towLewd I think I might play wow again to play this! hardcore mode brings some life to the game!
[3:45:46] Juzzieee: @noon33ver there is still a week until FF is considered a woldwide MMO
[3:45:48] Chiraakitteh: Being in a group would generally be safer
[3:45:49] Hjolt: hello world?
[3:46:21] Hjolt: can take a few hours though Kappa
[3:46:22] ZyntosAran: @Juzzieee what happens in a week?
[3:46:34] Juzzieee: @noon33ver endwaker expansion releases with OCE servers
[3:46:36] pereadin: Whats the hardcore mode about Towel?
[3:46:38] Azathul: i would do retail shaman hardcore
[3:46:41] Chiraakitteh: It’s the race of the health bars!
[3:46:54] PadidinJones: @Towelliee just stay in the forrest and kill boars!
[3:47:01] ZyntosAran: @Juzzieee endwalker was delayed to dezember
[3:47:14] Buttscratchrr: why did you pick warrior jw ?
[3:47:18] Juzzieee: @noon33ver okay then until December its still a reigonal MMO and my point about WoW is right
[3:47:26] fearlessfungi: With HC mode it makes sense that people would go the the barrens. It's a ton safer
[3:47:34] pereadin: Warrior defo hardest challenge

[3:47:37] pereadin: Warrior and Rogue
[3:47:43] ArcaneSyntax: those boars in the forrest are dangerous, thats how esfand is no longer with us.
[3:47:45] kessolover: im doing rouge HC its really fun but scary
[3:47:47] Tighron: warriors are the meat and potatoes of classic still ^^
[3:47:54] mojusk: wheres the "live to win" track?
[3:47:58] Hjolt: rogue can literally stealth through some quests
[3:48:05] fusionred1991: see some dude with nothin on slaying ppl for no reason then your like shit
[3:48:20] pereadin: true but they're very squishhy
[3:48:24] Amarlian: it's why I stick with druid
[3:48:27] Azathul: Rogue has some good disengage, especially once you get vanish
[3:48:47] Buttscratchrr: I main rogue but Probably gonna play druid for this!
[3:48:53] Hjolt: Ashenvale crypts rogue ambushes ptsd
[3:49:04] crashoverride_gaming: Or “I’ll play warlock and you play priest all the way to 60!” I just find that pretty much cheating
[3:49:06] ZyntosAran: @Juzzieee does wow have japanese servers?
[3:49:32] srcakz: hunter was my favorite
[3:49:37] Azathul: i just hate the shapeshifting costing mana
[3:49:53] Amarlian: And you have a decent way to pull range
[3:49:57] PokerFaceMoose: I liked leveling shaman. lightning bolt, shock, afk melee swings.
[3:50:00] wolfmankm: wolfmankm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[3:50:04] Juzzieee: @noon33ver no idea, i heard they do but its so bad that nobody ever plays on it. I've had plenty of JP players on OCE servers say OCE is way better than JP
[3:50:24] mojusk: monkaW
[3:51:04] ZyntosAran: @Juzzieee as far as I can see there are none, so not global
[3:51:10] LawnSpeaker: it's the right hand tree, in resto, right?
[3:51:18] Gizimoo86: 30 % less mana cost when changing forms
[3:53:17] Dwaverson: yo anyone know why my addons wont show up for classic?
[3:53:19] LawnSpeaker: oh, yeah, it's in balance on the left >.<
[3:53:28] TheHoboWithAShotgun: this classic?
[3:53:29] Herzenliegen: This place sucks
[3:53:32] Dwaverson: yeah
[3:53:36] Buttscratchrr: I haven't played wow in about a year but I'm hype for this and don't know why
[3:53:46] LawnSpeaker: Yeah, I was thinking of furor
[3:53:49] absoluteragez: what are the penalties for hc mode
[3:54:17] absoluteragez: bet
[3:54:30] Azathul: What will drop the ironman buff other than dying?
[3:54:33] crashoverride_gaming: @towelliee so is there like “a lot of people” doing this hardcore?? I am just curious to know like number wise
[3:55:10] peiman92: U get a mark aswell right?
[3:55:22] enux337: this might be hard
[3:55:24] EffitAhl: the make the radius smaller?
[3:55:29] DeCoyThatGuy: where is towelliee's range weapon for split pulls
[3:55:32] enux337: id get a bow
[3:55:33] Zakali: Time to get that 10 silver and buy a bow?
[3:55:35] Functionalidiot: and in the case that your interwebz go down in the middle of a fight and get d/c and come back dead...
[3:55:40] Zakali: or throwing weapons
[3:55:49] enux337: ^
[3:56:06] zgarbunia_official: nice to see you playing hc @Towelliee  god luck bro <3
[3:56:10] superxfire: do you still get debuff if you have soul stone on you?  for hc mode
[3:56:19] mojusk: does pvp death count?
[3:56:21] Functionalidiot: both sides if I rem right lead to the end room
[3:56:35] augi112: below you

[3:56:46] Nosed2: Is this worth playing again? :D
[3:56:48] enux337: i think one is in the room with the named mob

[3:59:33] mojusk: beware of any murlocs
[3:59:46] Calphurnious: I'm new to this. Is heroic mode a personal goal or is this a mode Blizzard implemented as a feature?
[4:00:11] Thewunk: What's up @Towelliee
[4:00:14] crashoverride_gaming: Blizzard implemented a buff
[4:00:31] king_julian_96: Want me to help towelliee my lock is level 15

[4:01:05] Sinful_Secrets: are you going to lvl in silverpine forest where the  son of arugals are?

[4:01:45] FleuryGG: this is stressful af
[4:01:52] mojusk: told ya, murlocs are bad news
[4:01:54] DeCoyThatGuy: murloc's have the worst agro range in the game. you can inadvertantly pull more than you will realize
[4:01:57] izarakk: I'm new to the game, I feel like I'm levelling really slow cause I'm not too sure what I'm doing. How long does it usually take to get to around level 10?
[4:02:03] Sinful_Secrets: murloc casters are terrible
[4:02:11] chintzypop: So game over if you die?
[4:02:18] PvtHudson093: murlocs will fuck you up

[4:04:40] DarthLemon: is this classic?
[4:04:42] theJUDGEtr: @buttscratchrr what was the answer to that? I thought you couldn’t?
[4:04:49] FrankTizzle: I mean you can only change so many other aspects of classic
[4:04:55] Armdel: @wthisgoingonanymore2 atleast this time its a "real" ironman, and not some self imposed thing
[4:05:18] wthisgoingonanymore2: @armdel I just meant classic leveling in general lol

[4:10:53] Zinaroth: @Zinaroth Paid quest helper addon that tells you exactly what to do to get to 60 the fastest. All the R2R streamers are partners and use/advertise it. LUL
[4:11:01] barely_casual_: That's a weird looking dwarf

[4:12:34] enux337: or you can get disconected
[4:12:49] Sneekzx: Wait, if you die the buff is gone?
[4:12:56] barely_casual_: there is a difference between Hardmode and Ironman
[4:13:01] Buckwink: mine was high too yesterday
[4:13:10] Zinaroth: @Towelliee People are confusing your HC challenge with the Road to Ragnaros event which has very specific rules.
[4:13:13] Oakengrove: @Towelliee the only crossbow vendor is down in undercity War Quarters
[4:13:15] nuudelz: im at 52 and im always under 20 in wow makes no sense
[4:13:22] FleuryGG: You're not gonna die. HOPIUM
[4:13:23] Sarocus: If you die, you get a debuff instead
[4:13:25] Gragnar: @Towelliee first time I went to UC as an orc warrior 17 years ago, the lift doors kept closing right in front of me as I got close to them. Made me think I couldn't get in UC as an orc...
[4:13:26] ExiaFTW: Morning from the 305

[4:19:58] nuudelz: to further prove it i duped even more LUL
[4:20:27] GravityRelapse: how long the season last?
[4:20:31] Rottencoarse: had to go afk are we talking about NW?
[4:20:41] Doc_Steelhammer: i waould have made Classic free to play
[4:20:42] SmokedHog: these are the OG towel streams
[4:20:44] xhaven: yea that doesn't sound like any real proof

[4:20:57] Kromede: days since last exploit: 0
[4:20:59] tiranz__: @GravityRelapse I think its like 1 year
[4:20:59] pereadin: Just found out I passed my real estate exam FeelsGoodMan
[4:21:18] Kromede: pereadin Clap
[4:21:18] crashoverride_gaming: You see the new world commercial?! I laughed so hard
[4:21:20] mojusk: @pereadin EZ Clap
[4:21:28] Secondbreakfasttt: They did not even fix it, just disable the future lol
[4:21:48] DrWraithjr: Amazon couldn't be handling this worse. Duping completely destroyed D2 and now we are going to see it destroy New World
[4:21:50] SmokedHog: didn't they fix the god mode by removing windowed mode
[4:21:53] Juzzieee: It's a good game handed to a bad dev team
[4:21:58] Juzzieee: they had no experience with MMOs
[4:22:06] FoxyLauxy: game is so good, and such a dumpster fire at the same time lol
[4:22:20] PokerFaceMoose: what kills me is that I had so much fun but I could have had so much more fun if the game wasn't so broken
[4:22:26] SmokedHog: instead of fixing the god mode glitch they just remove windowed mode
[4:22:35] xhaven: all mmos go through problems especially at the start
[4:22:38] BTiZZY_: @juzzieee handed? didn’t they develop the game?
[4:23:11] mojusk: they did something right for sure
[4:23:25] Juzzieee: @BTiZZY_ yeah but i dont think the developers who are fixing the game is the same that did all the theroycrafting on the game
[4:23:29] nuudelz: in games where theres an economy if theres duping gold then its over
[4:23:33] FoxyLauxy: I mean, I still WANT to play, and i'm hyped for the future of it.  I just want them to find their footing lol
[4:23:34] CritcobainTV: Duping literally ruins the game
[4:23:40] thuggnaztygaming: !addons
[4:23:41] CritcobainTV: can make it unplayable
[4:23:41] Polysemes: duping has killed so many games, wildstar had it, that dumb bless online port did, etc
[4:23:44] Eutopia: in an mmo its inexcusable
[4:23:50] DrWraithjr: If you can dupe the entire game becomes pointless.
[4:23:58] Zinaroth: I didn't get New World at launch because D2R came out but I would be up for playing it now if it wasn't for the economy already being fucked. If they do fresh servers I would pay and play.
[4:24:20] MonarchTeaV: d2
[4:24:20] SmokedHog: Wolcen
[4:24:21] flebbooo: GTA

[4:24:25] CritcobainTV: Runescape had a lot of issues with it
[4:24:27] theSalute: d2
[4:24:27] burning2bright: well the PVP bugg with windowed mode and becoming immortal and holdin bases in wars sucked.
[4:24:28] nuudelz: wolcen, d2, runescape
[4:24:32] Demanisraar: 'GTA V
[4:24:35] godpwer: porn
[4:24:36] Dunitz: in a forum post they said they banned over 2000 players who were abusing the dupe issues.
[4:24:37] PrimalRain: duping was bad in wow in vanilla too
[4:24:42] SmokedHog: client side games experience duping
[4:24:44] Polysemes: wildstar died due to it, bless online same, d2 late in its life
[4:24:48] Royin2k3: everquest
[4:24:49] PvtHudson093: PSO 1 and 2
[4:24:49] pereadin: Runescape literally had to remove items and banned thousands of accounts
[4:24:53] theSalute: lmao when I was a kid playing d2, I had to worry about disappearing items cause they were dupes xXD
[4:24:56] Oakengrove: Does the wowtoken count LUL
[4:25:01] 1088mike: lol this music is making me want to play wow again 😂
[4:25:06] theSalute: so yuou had to perm your items, so they dont poof hahaha
[4:25:16] nuudelz: d2 you had items go poof all the time
[4:25:22] SmokedHog: there will only be more issues with new world- the majority of the coding is client side
[4:25:43] mojusk: monkaS
[4:26:16] FoxyLauxy: are there any unofficial hardcore character servers for SoM?
[4:26:54] SmokedHog: RP
[4:26:55] Kresnyx: I think they really should have done pvp servers
[4:27:01] itsChiliiii: totally makes sense
[4:27:02] Kresnyx: Kind of sucks that wasnt in
[4:27:03] xTomHolmes: Makes a whole lot of sense
[4:27:07] Zakali: They did PvP servers?
[4:27:13] Its_Me_MG: totally makes sense to me.
[4:27:15] Zakali: Nobody just playes on those.
[4:27:16] touchofpinkfizz: That does make sense
[4:27:21] heavenlylol: Are these appart server list or is it a new client?
[4:27:24] CritcobainTV: I feel that man. If i don't get the name Critcobain it just feels wrong @Towelliee
[4:27:35] Brodih_: do pvp harcore servers even exist ? i would not make sense
[4:27:39] GODZILR1: Name = reputation, can get a lot of things for you
[4:27:43] Amarlian: Is there a Handy notes addon for nodes for this?
[4:27:46] mojusk: taking nodes notes
[4:28:04] itsChiliiii: Bertybert is the farmer
[4:28:39] flebbooo: KEKW
[4:28:47] Zinaroth: @Qhaz_ In WoW or in general? In general hardcore PvP in MMORPG refers to games where either PvP is always on everywhere or where people can loot your stuff or both.
[4:28:49] KillaPr0: hatchet and hammer for me
[4:29:08] Zenrick12: Is there a command for the rules and such for this?
[4:29:21] KillaPr0: though i am leveling my sword and board
[4:29:27] After43ver: gMorning Mr Towel, hope your doing well and enjoying SOM
[4:29:33] Brodih_: i meant Hardcore as no deaths allowed, in SoM @Zinaroth
[4:29:38] crashoverride_gaming: @towelliee did you go mining and what else???
[4:29:59] Sarocus: You can mine a node more than once. You're in classic :)
[4:30:11] crashoverride_gaming: Gotcha
[4:30:23] elwingk: ofc bs and mining, when his gear breaks, he just crafts a new piece
[4:30:23] Zinaroth: @Qhaz_ Yeah I reckoned that's what you meant just saying semantically hardcore covers more than just character death. But no I don't think there's a hardcore PvP community in that sense. Would be brutal. LUL
[4:30:27] CritcobainTV: yea
[4:30:50] After43ver: Rag must DIE!
[4:31:00] zylverb0x: Yeah and more nodes for herbalism and mining
[4:31:06] luckfore: i wonder if they were planning to release the 9.2 ptr this week
[4:31:11] xhaven: what do you use to install addons for classic again chat?
[4:31:31] wthisgoingonanymore2: little too late? idk what is som
[4:31:37] AlexTheSlav: classic, fresh start ?
[4:31:43] neky96: How can anyone do this? Like waste 2 days for 3 levels killing trash. How are you not getting bored
[4:31:54] AlexTheSlav: oh im in the WotLK waiting room bigtime xD
[4:31:57] donny_bee: so funny to hear that sentence spoken
[4:32:00] PvtHudson093: i need wrath classic
[4:32:10] wthisgoingonanymore2: people are going going get crazy bored of WotLK too lmao watch give it 2 weeks
[4:32:13] razerface: wotlk <3
[4:32:14] denflup: did you enjoy TBC?
[4:32:21] lookItsJB: lookItsJB subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[4:32:23] AlexTheSlav: @wthisgoingonanymore2 neeeveeeeer xD
[4:32:35] Akantorwar: what changed?
[4:32:36] After43ver: I like having both
[4:32:39] AlexTheSlav: but you cant use /spit
[4:32:40] Shadowkaster: whats different?
[4:32:42] lucaniusTV: Can u play tbc in SOM
[4:32:47] KralYoshii: Whats the difference in the 2
[4:32:47] crashoverride_gaming: But so once you hit 60….you can raid and hold the buff? Like I am a little confused on instances and raids. Like DTA
[4:32:48] mojusk: #nochanges bandwagon ruined it
[4:32:48] Amarlian: just one QoL that i wish were in it was dual spec. I know that's wrath but still
[4:33:02] Juzzieee: @lucaniusTV nah SoM is on the classic client
[4:33:03] After43ver: was a blast to play the orig classic
[4:33:03] Moobot: Check out all of the new changes for WoW Classic Season of Mastery at Wowhead! https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/season-of-mastery-som-overview-wow-classic
[4:33:04] nuudelz: if they make the naxx patch in wotlk as long as kara was itll die
[4:33:17] lucaniusTV: @juzzieee Ah ok
[4:33:39] wthisgoingonanymore2: yeah... nax 25 man is going to be a reality shock for some people on how boring that game was at first
[4:33:45] Demanisraar: Just want to play old school good paladin
[4:33:46] enux337: nah i wanna farm badges
[4:33:49] Demanisraar: in wrath
[4:33:56] After43ver: and ... Death Knights! YES
[4:33:57] dewking93: is season of mastery going to just be classic wow or will it keep going into bc
[4:34:00] PvtHudson093: cata took a bunch of stuff out of retail wow
[4:34:03] mojusk: just the right amount of casualization imo
[4:34:05] Zinaroth: My problem is that eventhough Wrath became too much retail its also the first iteration of WoW where my Feral doesnt suck
[4:34:07] nuudelz: you say you want to farm badges until your done in a week
[4:34:08] zgarbunia_official: when wotlk comes guys
[4:34:08] lucaniusTV: Did they say wen wotlk   Comes out
[4:34:09] freetherocktv: @Towelliee wrathgate questline was epic
[4:34:10] Buttscratchrr: I had the most fun in Wrath for PVE and PVP
[4:34:11] AlexTheSlav: i dunno, but the dungeons are just fun in WotLK, the raids are fun, the emblem system is fun, DK, Wintergrasp :)
[4:34:14] Juzzieee: Wrath but without group finder
[4:34:15] donny_bee: @Zinaroth true
[4:34:22] cahoots82: gimme back dat wotlk unholy dk!
[4:34:22] Silver_Lion: Halls of Reflection monkaS
[4:34:24] mojusk: grp finder was realm restricted
[4:34:31] Oakengrove: I liked wotlk class design. I also hope they never make the LFG cross realm in classic.
[4:34:35] MoonwalkingAngel: group finder at launch
[4:34:42] AlexTheSlav: Ulduar was a pain
[4:34:43] After43ver: no GroupFinder hurt TBC
[4:34:49] wthisgoingonanymore2: uld was the only hard raid! LMAO
[4:34:49] Tyrsfal: I think they should learn from this and apply modifications too if possible. HP Values/these sorts of things
[4:34:59] Siraeyou: It would be cool to watch people do alone in the darkness and 25 HC LK again
[4:34:59] enux337: frost dk tanking /blood dps
[4:34:59] Malkyr: I dislike Wintergrasp still to this day personally and I loved Vanilla/BC pvp lol.
[4:35:09] Buckwink: ill be honest I hated Wrath
[4:35:16] freetherocktv: ulduar is like the best looking raid
[4:35:17] zylverb0x: Ulduar favorite raid all time
[4:35:27] donny_bee: just really not at all interested in blizzard games anymore
[4:35:31] denflup: are you sure wotlk will happen?
[4:35:43] Oakengrove: Group Finder wasn't cross realm at first in WotLK. Hope they keep it that way.
[4:35:45] Zinaroth: If your argument is that Ulduar was good because it was hard then ICC is even better that took a long time for people to clear.
[4:35:49] Yeeshhh: @Aruar89 why wouldn't it
[4:35:49] zylverb0x: Ulduar was most fun I’ve had in my wow career. Well that and BT
[4:35:57] crashoverride_gaming: I can’t do ulduar…I just can’t towCry towCringe
[4:36:02] Buttscratchrr: WOLTK classic will happen for sure! thats when they were at their peak
[4:36:09] nuudelz: ulduar was cut way too short in live launch
[4:36:29] ExiaFTW: I pray they do not add a dungeon finder in wotlk
[4:36:32] ExiaFTW: by popular demand
[4:37:55] crashoverride_gaming: “No lights in the darkness” I think that’s why parts of my hair went grey 😂
[4:38:00] sifer007: ad lfg toll to classic
[4:38:02] nuudelz: if they do a 3.0 launch frost dks were still tank spec
[4:38:16] Zenrick12: its a QOL thing for the easier stuff there are still dungeons you need to have a better group for and gear for.

[4:38:25] xXSiebzehnXx: @crashoverride_gaming that and knock knock knock on wood
[4:38:30] Day_Walker78: frost dk tank was the best loved it
[4:38:54] enux337: going frost tank/ blood dk dps lol
[4:38:55] Zinaroth: To be fair without dungeon finder I wouldn't be able to play with others. I simply do not have the time or surplus to socially engage and cultivate relationships in a video game.
[4:39:02] MoonwalkingAngel: everybody wil start bitching again how dk is not a real class if ya play dk
[4:39:16] Oakengrove: @Towelliee You think dungeon finder should be cross realm though?
[4:39:37] xXSiebzehnXx: @zinaroth mostly same. I hate the feeling of inconveniencing others. It’s hard to get over
[4:39:44] xXSiebzehnXx: And I’m actually pretty good haha
[4:39:45] Juzzieee: I did dungeons in TBC and Classic fine without making friends
[4:39:50] enux337: ret pallies are gonna slap
[4:40:07] tigzie: dual spec would of been amazing addition
[4:40:12] king_waltzy: unironically found groups faster in lfg channel than i did group finder
[4:40:17] Valestrus: werent you included in the no changed crowd?
[4:40:18] Silver_Lion: agreed
[4:40:25] easy_wheezy: as long as the core remained the same, adding QoL changes is fine
[4:40:27] Royin2k3: just thinking about a LFR Molten Core, oh man
[4:40:37] PurplePyrex: anyone farming deadmines yet or no?
[4:40:37] Cyxxplz: Theres a road on the westside of te hill
[4:40:38] xXSiebzehnXx: @rempyr I ran over 1k dungeons in TBC and rarely talked to anyone
[4:40:41] xTomHolmes: Some 25-man hardmodes were actually hard at their respective seasons, like actually hard hard.
[4:40:44] Endeavourz: What exactly is the season of mastery? @Towelliee
[4:40:50] Zinaroth: @xXSiebzehnXx For me it's just job and two kids. I spend maybe 2-3 hours ingame each day. When am I supposed to find time to build a community? Also I need to play when I am able to play I cant just sit around to wait an hour. I have a life now, dungeon finder is a must for me.
[4:40:58] mojusk: @Rempyr not as antisocial when its not crossrealm
[4:41:03] DeCoyThatGuy: instead of the right side to go to SM, take the road, left, after the summon stone
[4:41:12] Cypfer: OOFduar
[4:41:13] nuudelz: yea you could name the guilds on your server that did 0 light
[4:41:25] gregl__: yet they will clear hardmode is less than 5 hours after ulduar release...
[4:41:35] gregl__: comparing it to retail nowadays its not hard
[4:41:38] gregl__: for its time it was hard sure
[4:41:44] Buttscratchrr: What realm are you on ?
[4:41:51] MoonwalkingAngel: if thay add lfg in classic and tbc ppl wil level more alts
[4:41:52] Hjolt: Dying to gravity, the biggest nemesis
[4:41:52] lolbigtrool: left the mining node agen :P
[4:42:01] Holysal: @Buttscratchrr Obsidian Edge
[4:42:04] Rottencoarse: @Buttscratchrr check the title -.-
[4:42:06] illusionnz: @Buttscratchrr in title
[4:42:10] Day_Walker78: @Buttscratchrr says on the titel
[4:42:20] lookItsJB: So they released another classic?
[4:42:26] Buttscratchrr: shit on phone didn't see at first my bad
[4:42:32] xTomHolmes: Don't think they need to tune the hardmodes much harder than they were, because with the gear you have at the time, they are already a nightmare
[4:42:37] mytherel: the first night uld opened up, we spent like 4 hours working XT
[4:42:45] GravityRelapse: @towelliee how long is the season?
[4:43:05] Juzzieee: DKs will be slightly nerfed on release, thats a given i think
[4:43:06] DeCoyThatGuy: that is probably why ppl dont want to start out in TB, cause they can die to elevator boss easier
[4:43:15] easy_wheezy: make naxx harder
[4:43:19] National89: maybe no dungeon finder
[4:43:31] Juzzieee: Dungeon finder will 100% be in the game as its a core feature of wrath
[4:43:34] KythosMeltdown: hope we can port SoM characters to TBC/Wrath
[4:43:36] nuudelz: they made it "harder" on pservers its still a joke
[4:43:46] ZeusDNA: ZeusDNA subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! towHAMUP
[4:44:15] Royin2k3: wait please dont tell me that pre wotlk naxx was "easy"?  yeah ok..
[4:44:15] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:44:21] nuudelz: so around activision time
[4:44:32] PvtHudson093: the 1% still had ulduar hard modes
[4:44:33] xTomHolmes: And that's all positive to the game and the player base, might I add
[4:44:49] KaisenSiru: A new generation of Wrath babies LUL
[4:44:53] Juzzieee: It was also Advertising
[4:45:00] Juzzieee: before Wrath i had never heard of WoW
[4:45:07] MisterSpoooky: What phase is tbc classic in right now
[4:45:25] DeansPlay: What means HC mode?
[4:45:27] Aravarth: GC came in right around or before Sunwell, yeah
[4:45:34] funKShun: nice tree models KEKW
[4:45:42] funKShun: 144p
[4:45:53] MoonwalkingAngel: lfg makes it eazyer to level cap cause questing can be a hard grind
[4:46:02] Hjolt: everyday player became better tho with each passing year.  then it took a wrong turn
[4:46:05] Royin2k3: yeah back then my guild never even got to KJ at sunwell.  that place was crazy.
[4:46:08] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Rempyr (warning)
[4:46:10] Aravarth: Honestly, that's right about the same time you saw the player base just explode to its peak. It made it more accessible.
[4:46:13] xTomHolmes: I thought most people were doing SWP at the time, but apparently they weren't
[4:46:19] Magalampe: What does "warrior HC mode " mean @Towelliee
[4:46:34] Oakengrove: Kinda funny how easy classic is compared to retail. Puts that post into perspective LUL
[4:46:50] AlexTheSlav: when do you expect WotLK ?
[4:46:56] Juzzieee: HC is Hardcore mode, it means if you die you need to restart your character
[4:47:07] jasperboy: We met the wall at m'uru
[4:47:20] xTomHolmes: Hated the M'uru fight, loved the Muramasa
[4:47:26] ExiaFTW: Do you expect an actual Classic+ ?
[4:47:32] riley_poker: @Juzzieee DID THEY ADD THIS IN THE NEW PATCH?
[4:47:36] riley_poker: *caps
[4:47:49] Sinful_Secrets: silverpine =son of arugal
[4:47:49] Wcvechten: inb4 son of arugal death
[4:47:51] Juzzieee: @riley_poker no its a community thing, SoM has no hardcore requirement
[4:47:54] lawles_walrus: I think we will hear a Roth announcement in may or June with a PTR in august or September
[4:47:59] Hjolt: Oddly enough i miss one thing about old WoW. The launchers
[4:48:01] rmelzer1986: Silverpine is fine, just be aware of your surroundings.
[4:48:23] lawles_walrus: wrath
[4:48:45] Hjolt: that frosty launcher for WoTLK was hella nice.

[4:48:55] sphjk: Its really more faster get exp?
[4:49:02] Endeavourz: @Hjolt Launchers being what? The login screen or was there a splash screen? I can't really remember
[4:49:19] Hjolt: na, you had launchers before game started. these days it's battle net
[4:49:22] Sneekzx: @chat what is that 2nd buff thatt towelliee has?
[4:49:23] Hjolt: to start up WoW
[4:49:24] Juzzieee: @Endeavourz you had a launcher for each game, now you have a blizz launcher for every game
[4:49:34] sphjk: Nice, thanks Toweelliee :)
[4:49:37] Biotechz: it's a considerable buff, but still takes a while to level
[4:49:39] Endeavourz: Yea now I'm rememberign the wrath one. It's been so long lmao
[4:49:41] AlexTheSlav: god i love to level in this game, its so chill, best part of the game...laid back, a bit of gathering for a crafting city break
[4:50:02] Juzzieee: this music BibleThump
[4:50:26] Yetik: D:
[4:50:41] nuudelz: it was a most peoples first go
[4:50:41] t0csik: what is your top 3 exp ??
[4:50:44] Wcvechten: I like how invincible plays in the background as you say that
[4:50:46] Endeavourz: When did the launchers go away? Was it WoD?
[4:50:58] TolgaDraws: I always enjoyed Wrath because it felt like a nice balance between classic and modern, while having a fun story and zones
[4:51:07] thechadiator: what is the addon called for his action bars?
[4:51:12] Rosalique_TTV: Everyone hates my fave expansion lol. Pandaria is my personal fave
[4:51:12] OkayButch: ice crown was just for the dance parties after killing lych king
[4:51:19] AlexTheSlav: thats what she said
[4:51:31] yourbillisdeau: is this some event or challenge going on?
[4:51:36] Juzzieee: @Endeavourz wikia says the first open beta was in 2013
[4:51:37] Gingerprimer: @Endeavourz pretty sure if you are talking about the game specific launcher it went away in WOD I think
[4:51:42] blacksheep806: Wotlk was when I started wow and icc was my first raid ever + I still think grizzly hills is the most gorgeous zone ever
[4:52:01] blacksheep806: so I wanna just the nostalgy tbh
[4:52:22] LegoCoin: What are they doing with the servers after seasons?
[4:52:39] Yetik: question marks Kreygasm
[4:52:50] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @mojusk (warning)
[4:52:50] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @mojusk (warning)
[4:52:54] Endeavourz: @Gingerprimer Yea, cause I remember it for Panda, but nothing else, so that make sense. I also started using the bnet launcher asap @Juzzieee
[4:53:00] w00lie75: Elvui?
[4:53:10] mojusk: ?? gachiHYPER ??
[4:53:22] Day_Walker78: @LegoCoin it will come more seasons efter this one i think
[4:53:28] howlingstorms: #
[4:53:34] Crowzcut: my his wrath and wod and shadowlands
[4:53:41] Day_Walker78: WoD was crap exp
[4:53:42] king_waltzy: i liked cata raiding/pvp
[4:53:50] DrWraithjr: Legion was the best. Great story
[4:53:50] PrimalRain: cata was better for me than SL so far
[4:53:55] Demanisraar: I liked cata tbh
[4:53:57] xendros78: what didn't you like about cata
[4:54:00] Rosalique_TTV: WoD made me quit WoW all together
[4:54:03] denflup: dude SL wasnt that bad first 3 months, the next 4 months literally killed it
[4:54:12] denflup: but first 3 months was fine imo
[4:54:14] Biotechz: first tier of raiding in Cata was out too long before Firelands
[4:54:21] surrendermonkee: What? did you even play WoTLK?
[4:54:40] Day_Walker78: WoD made me stop playing i came back in legion
[4:54:43] Juzzieee: I quit playing during MoP
[4:54:43] Aphrodisia2881: eww pandaria, i couldnt
[4:54:45] howlingstorms: @towelliee u going to raiding in this version or just get to 60
[4:54:46] belfastcl: people don't remember the first part of wotlk, which was pretty bad even pvp wise
[4:54:56] mmrghost7: how does classic re re launch going ?
[4:55:01] RiptoreCA: Wildstar the greatest game that never made it... sadge
[4:55:05] CritcobainTV: Until SL
[4:55:06] CritcobainTV: Pog
[4:55:07] Monkkey: wow its hard to find people who admit to playing wildstar lmao
[4:55:09] stjon13: Pandaria raiding was goat
[4:55:16] nuudelz: who didnt stop at one point in SoO
[4:55:19] Gingerprimer: I started playing in Legion and that was great has only been downhill since tho #sadage
[4:55:26] KaisenSiru: No expansion has ever made me stop playing. Each one i have enjoyed and flourished in. Never going to end.
[4:55:26] cahoots82: I don't think SL was great by any means, and probably deserves to be down at the bottom but the xpac did have some issues outside of Blizz's control that affected things - still though, it did not live up to any hype
[4:55:36] Monkkey: favorite expansion towelliee?
[4:55:38] RiptoreCA: WIldstar was ridiculously amazing @Monkkey
[4:55:38] CritcobainTV: The first few months at the start of SL was fun
[4:55:44] CritcobainTV: like 2-3 months i enjoyed SL
[4:55:45] Monkkey: was it legion?
[4:55:48] SpratsTV: biggest thing i remember from cata was rogues getting those stupid daggers and constantly being top dps
[4:55:49] Duekov: You're still not playing retail...you back to the original :v
[4:55:50] Bezroth: darkleveldelta subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! 
[4:55:55] D4r1uZ: Wildstar was actually really good indeed, sad they had to "Put it down"
[4:55:57] xendros78: I enjoyed the leveling process through the zones in draenor, the rest was meh, same with mists
[4:56:05] bierarnoo: Tbc- wrath and Pandaria. Best one for me.
[4:56:14] alirezakm80: !addons
[4:56:23] CritcobainTV: Kreygasm
[4:56:24] Aravarth: I mean, ppl were down on WoD a lot, but the storylines were absolute tits, and I really enjoyed the Garrison and Shipyard features
[4:56:40] luckfore: boby is still there :P
[4:56:52] mmrghost7: no expansion will ever be as good as legion sadge
[4:57:00] denflup: that 7 months its the problem
[4:57:16] yl_muldoon: hellfire citadel lasted a year i think and siege of orgrimmar even longer than that
[4:57:26] AlexTheSlav: time to go home

[4:57:28] Aravarth: Honestly, I think that's prolly why they released WoW SOM. All of Classic is nothing more than subscription retention when retail shits the bed.
[4:57:33] AlexTheSlav: have a great stream mitz7
[4:57:49] hera1621: tbf pandamic didnt help
[4:58:00] xendros78: it doesn't help blizz that everything they do for 9.2 will be considered a riff on endwalker
[4:58:00] king_waltzy: 9.2 has to be the worst looking patch sense... well, 9.1 i guess
[4:58:11] Falcoonik: I was very defensive for WoW at first, but now I'm really happy that they have their asses kicked - I hope it won't end them tho, but motivate them
[4:58:31] king_waltzy: 9.0 was a decent start which is a shame, shadowlands had potential

[4:58:45] stjon13: they really missed the mark w/ the Jailer...
[4:58:51] Zakali: yea 9.0 just without ripcord would have been a daecent start.
[4:58:51] Eutopia: Developers have been working games from home since 2013 and earlier. The pandemic excuse is just that an excuse
[4:59:00] Zakali: But Jailer is the most boring bad guy, thats true.
[4:59:10] KythosMeltdown: @stjon13 they've just missed the mark on developing the warcraft universe.
[4:59:24] MezzanineZ: they also shoot themselves in the foot with decisions, like they have legion timewalking m+, but only for a very limited time, thats free content for people to do
[4:59:43] Kromede: what story!?
[4:59:44] Zakali: im excited on whats coming
[4:59:47] Gingerprimer: Jailer is great problem is lack of content/sytems are bad
[4:59:50] Zakali: I just think they made him super boring
[4:59:50] Yetik: i like that theyre is still mystery around him
[4:59:51] KythosMeltdown: @Towelliee then why is the jailer doing what he's doing??
[4:59:53] FireEmblemLord: zovaal is cool
[4:59:55] PrimalRain: they barely built him up
[5:00:00] FireEmblemLord: his armor is badass
[5:00:00] thunderioum: shadowlands story OMEGALUL
[5:00:03] Crowzcut: i feel jailer going be nice guy at the end
[5:00:05] RiptoreCA: 1260 xp per quest wow that's aweome.
[5:00:09] Gingerprimer: @KythosMeltdown that is what we are learning in the story
[5:00:12] Malkyr: The setting of Shadowlands is awesome, the story is good but Im sick of the named characters in WoW
[5:00:12] damien_: Jailer doesnt even seem like a bad guy, why is what hes doing bad
[5:00:14] KaisenSiru: I too am invested in the story as well!
[5:00:15] mrrazputin: So Towelliee when will you tell us about 10.0 ? :D
[5:00:20] Layliah79: Great xpac for collectors. They put in so many mounts!
[5:00:21] The_Farting_Spaniard: Fascinating story? WoW retail? please lol
[5:00:27] JoelGusto: Has anything changed on wow classic? Because I've seen many people coming back to it lately
[5:00:29] Spykex02: Copium
[5:00:32] squid_boii: COPIUM
[5:00:36] RiptoreCA: LUL
[5:00:37] lawles_walrus: I agree with you the story is good I think the way they told it could have been better
[5:00:40] Malkyr: Both Anduin and Sylvanas I could forget about happily at this point
[5:00:40] KythosMeltdown: @Gingerprimer a year of 'learning' and we still don't know the jailers motivations?
[5:00:40] DrWraithjr: LUL
[5:00:42] stjon13: I mean they tried to tie him into the backstory and it's really sloppy
[5:00:43] Todmeister9000: when will you tell us about the mobile game?
[5:00:46] Falcoonik: I would really love the twist that Jailer ends up being the good guy tho and we could know him in later expacs as an ally kicking ass of Winter Queen etc... but it won't happen :(
[5:00:48] Thoreya: gz
[5:00:50] KaisenSiru: YEP so true
[5:00:51] Nauticca: How's the Razer Gunnars going? Thinking about getting a pair for the holidays
[5:00:59] xendros78: people would flip their shit if sylvanas was the first companion in their swtor style companion system LUL
[5:01:03] eakiller: we will support you if you get banned <3
[5:01:21] thunderioum: they should have the story be like "we defeat jailer but he goes back to being the leader of the maw and we execute sylvanas for the genocide and her soul end up in the maw and get tortured for eternity for her betrayal " then again im not a lore writer in blizz what do i know ! danouser is
[5:01:22] Rowini30: is hardcore a legit game mode now? or just something you promise to do
[5:01:30] Gingerprimer: @KythosMeltdown the reason it has been a year is because we have had 2 real patches for the duration of SL we have learned stuff problem is content is slow
[5:01:36] RiptoreCA: https://clips.twitch.tv/FamousCogentMochaKlappa-l7t3joSJo-IUa2MB
[5:01:41] Gingerprimer: @Rowini30 you get a buff
[5:01:44] RiptoreCA: LUL
[5:01:49] Rowini30: oh cool
[5:01:56] mmo_kenna_: Played the new Halo?? Spoiler... it's really good

[5:02:27] TheItalianStallion321: outside either trade goods or general goods
[5:02:28] Zakali: Trade Goods
[5:02:29] KythosMeltdown: @Gingerprimer how does that make any sense? nothing that happens in the story is going to make it worth killing the game for an entire year
[5:02:51] DaxxTMI: DaxxTMI subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[5:02:58] woolheadtv: what addon is the top exp stats bar?
[5:03:04] Gingerprimer: @MarcRages not sure since I do not play classic atm but
[5:03:19] Amarlian: !wa
[5:03:34] Amarlian: @woolheadtv It's a weak Aura
[5:03:40] Amarlian: I forget which one
[5:03:51] Gingerprimer: @KythosMeltdown the story is not  proggressing since story in wow comes with content patches so if we are not getting content patches we are not getting any progression of the story
[5:03:52] Moobot: Check out all of the new changes for WoW Classic Season of Mastery at Wowhead! https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/season-of-mastery-som-overview-wow-classic

[5:05:48] Cardeia: @Amarlian its a WA from luxthos iirc.
[5:06:16] khaos_gg: What is hardcore mode?
[5:06:48] mmo_kenna_: Are there any Seasonal rewards that you carry through?
[5:07:06] KythosMeltdown: @mmo_kenna_ theres no extra rewards other than bonus xp
[5:07:08] Rexialiton: @khaos_gg if you die delete your character
[5:08:19] mmo_kenna_: If it had Season specific rewards I might've been interested
[5:08:40] thechadiator: @Towelliee do you have a list of addons anywhere?
[5:08:44] KythosMeltdown: i wish getting the rewards in classic would give u the transmog in retail
[5:08:53] KythosMeltdown: id grind r14 happily if that were the case lol
[5:09:15] KaisenSiru: monkaW
[5:09:20] thechadiator: @Towelliee nice, thanks!
[5:09:34] DigitalZonez: so does classic have season servers or somthing?
[5:10:02] lucaniusTV: How do u download ur ui from tbc
[5:10:31] Jahknowme: Definitely should add their own HC servers for this stuff would be cool
[5:10:32] Aravarth: @MarcRages Yes
[5:10:36] Silver_Lion: what server is it
[5:10:38] DigitalZonez: i dont have it installed is there anything diffrent with the servers or is it just a reset?
[5:10:47] Amarlian: 130 odm
[5:10:53] Gregadeaux: I think the other PVE server is larger
[5:10:55] Amarlian: 130 isn't that bad
[5:10:56] KythosMeltdown: @MarcRages Holly Longdale from EQ produced that game to have Seasons like every 9-12 months that go until that games 'prime' expansions
[5:10:59] FireEmblemLord: im here too (alliance
[5:11:03] Aravarth: I think the NA East PvE server is the other "big" server, but there's no queue either
[5:11:03] Herzenliegen: soda is on nightfall
[5:11:07] Coldfire989: Soda is PvP and Asmon is PvE
[5:11:11] Rexialiton: Isn't Soda on Jom whatever server
[5:11:15] SSJ_Vegetaa: are we finally done with shit new world
[5:11:21] TheItalianStallion321: Shadowstrike is larger it has a full capacity, your server is high
[5:11:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: it was pretty packed on east
[5:11:28] Gregadeaux: Yeah everyone was going east coast. Only reason the HC community went west coast was because they wanted a low pop server
[5:11:38] Herzenliegen: east coast is full
[5:11:47] Herzenliegen: nohardmode
[5:11:52] Rexialiton: He said that he wants to dps MC
[5:11:57] KythosMeltdown: thanked my lucky stars when asmon didnt roll on my server XD
[5:11:57] Aervyper: @Towelliee what's everyone freaking out about old Bobby for?
[5:12:01] YardRage: well you gotta admit asmon's followers can be uhhh a handful
[5:12:03] Eutopia: Jom Gabber is biggest server in general i think
[5:12:44] Tastyporkchop: whats happenin dude
[5:12:44] tiekfu: its not the sttreamers they dont like.
[5:12:45] clamthenerd: Is there an HC guild on horde? I saw a lot of hte HC players on alliance
[5:13:01] Aravarth: lmao no @Baleroc1 that's like people getting mad at streamers in general because they make a living
[5:13:03] Padarius: Forever and always
[5:13:05] Aravarth: cry more
[5:13:29] KythosMeltdown: @Towelliee org
[5:13:34] KythosMeltdown: crossbow is under
[5:13:35] flyingbufanda: Darnassus I think
[5:13:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: org

[5:15:54] DigitalZonez: ohh so its 40$ increased xp but even more if your grouped.
[5:15:59] DigitalZonez: 40%
[5:16:11] mikemartin206: Wow is falling off. They need new players

[5:16:31] theSalute: ahhhh
[5:16:32] KythosMeltdown: @Towelliee in EQ they used to send out in game polls to decide when to move on. Could see that happening in WoW
[5:16:37] cahoots82: @mikemartin206 So a business that is failing should just start giving it's product away for free? Excellent idea!
[5:16:49] TheRealPabloSanchez: haha thats me
[5:16:49] futomara01: correct
[5:16:52] mikemartin206: @daikanatv Actually I’ve had a sub for 12 years now

[5:19:39] Tharia: yeah I was contemplating boosting but not sure
[5:19:39] SteveSD: anything wow should be free, if it aint its a scammaz
[5:19:40] shale93: for some people those 6 hours are more valuable than 60$
[5:19:41] Nalakitteh: Yeah I don't boost anymore I noticed when I do I lose interest quicker

[5:19:55] SwollenClam: Rocket philosophy is amazing
[5:19:56] NBK_Sethus: wut LUL

[5:20:01] Nalakitteh: Boosting is no fun for me
[5:20:02] Tharia: I did boost a rogue though because f that leveling ugh
[5:20:06] FleuryGG: "you no good scoundrel" well he wasn't wrong Sadge
[5:20:07] veryhairyheyyall: FAX
[5:20:07] tiekfu: ive leveled so many times in wow over the years i cant stomach it anymore
[5:20:22] Herzenliegen: I would never pay a 60 boost for retail. It's way to easy to level now
[5:20:34] stjon13: ya you can't mess with Azeroth
[5:20:37] Biotechz: just imagine if they didn't do the level squish
[5:20:41] Tharia: same @tiektheorc  I leveled all classes for that achievement... can't do it now
[5:20:41] nuudelz: theres too many side quests
[5:20:46] FireEmblemLord: ill just get the 40 bc pass cuss I dont feel like lvling my character on bc servers
[5:20:48] Nalakitteh: I boosted a priest once never really played her after to easy I guess
[5:21:00] SteveSD: id come back to wow if they removed cash shop. so im never coming back lmao
[5:21:08] Rexialiton: @40yearoldwowplayer True

[5:21:19] LordKain73: @40yearoldwowplayer you're trying too hard.  stop.
[5:21:23] SwollenClam: ^
[5:21:27] Nalakitteh: Lol
[5:21:27] Aravarth: Plus, the storyline in SWTOR is awesome
[5:21:33] kokochris: FF14 MSQ is really long
[5:21:42] Malkyr: @Reckless_Monk 100% honest do HW then boost if you still are feeling it. It took me 5 years to slog though the MSQ, it really drags in places. I snap bought a boost when I changed servers, worth every penny
[5:21:43] Attackroot: its very enjoyable.
[5:21:44] Nalakitteh: Yes  story in Store is fun
[5:21:53] MrKhanes: @40yearoldwowplayer Whats so wrong with ppl enjoying diffrent games? Or enjoy multiple mmos? I do.
[5:21:57] Nalakitteh: Swtor*
[5:21:59] shale93: @40yearoldwowplayer nobody cares

[5:22:05] nuudelz: more mmo than rpg
[5:22:06] MrMordrag: im new
[5:22:18] dewking93: after endwalkler will ff go away finally?
[5:22:34] Aravarth: if you're a male jedi knight and you don't sex Laura Bailey's voice character Kira Carsen, you're wrong
[5:22:35] Reckless_Monk: @Malkyr I heard HW it gets better. Im kinda speeding throgh ARRs crap. Evertyhting esle looks cool

[5:22:47] MrKhanes: @dewking93 No it will not, its the final chapter of the current story.
[5:22:52] SindrinX2: SWTOR was Bioware story writing at its best. Shame most of the writers scattered to the wind after that.
[5:22:55] Skylin3r: Sup Iron Man
[5:22:59] Tharia: classic @mrmordrag then select SoM realm
[5:23:05] blueheisen: i bet ppl who say ff is trash never got past level 30

[5:24:38] shinta__: what's that face in the castbar
[5:24:39] Reckless_Monk: Cant wait to see HW. ARR was rough
[5:24:46] tuberculosislung: what exactly is HC mode? you can't die?
[5:25:01] NotDillyTV: Good morning everybody!
[5:25:11] Herzenliegen: Wow Org is dead atm. I'm use to seeing tons of ppl on top of the AH
[5:25:12] Skylin3r: FF has the best crafting system
[5:25:14] Biorrwolf: I mean, WoW is no Star Citizen
[5:25:21] blacksheep806: that casting bar xD
[5:25:25] blacksheep806: wth lol
[5:25:26] dewking93: i have tryed every other mmo and i keep comparing it to wow and never can stick to it like wow
[5:25:35] theSalute: KKona
[5:25:49] fewyn: crafting in FF is fun
[5:25:52] stjon13: I want to like FF just don't like bunnygirl eastern flavor
[5:25:58] Skylin3r: let just say it's not just click a button
[5:26:00] thecynicalshuffler: cant wait to see FFxiv's servers catch fire for endwalker. saw an article where several of the biggest vtubers got approval from their agency to stream FF. think of asmongold x 10...  lol @Towelliee
[5:26:06] fewyn: way more engaging than in wow or any other mmo
[5:26:12] Duekov: LOL I'm doing culinary right now :v it's fun
[5:26:21] Nalakitteh: I say to each their own some like ffxiv better some like wow.. doesn't make one better then the other.
[5:26:23] LemonDrizzleCakes: How bad is retail? its hard to gauge how bad it is because people are very toxic online in general
[5:26:33] TiredCarcass: not to busy today in the under city
[5:26:37] kokochris: @Nalakitteh exactly
[5:26:38] Skylin3r: though it's current version is super easy
[5:26:40] TheItalianStallion321: FF crafting is almost an entirely different part of the game.
[5:26:47] jezaknight93: jezaknight93 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[5:26:53] Aravarth: Yeah, 65 to mine tin and smelt tin/bronze
[5:27:03] ReIIek: @thecynicalshuffler yeah its why they delayed two weeks, theyre expecting extremely large numbers.  I wish them luck but yeah prob gonna be rough.
[5:27:13] Zinaroth: Only needing one character is the most enticing part about FFXIV for me. The aesthetics not so much, the combat not at all. Also the world building is pretty terrible. I don't feel immersed at all.
[5:27:24] Biorrwolf: @dewking93 it's the WoW curse, and nothing can ever be as enjoyable until you stop comparing. Each mmo is so unique in its own way, that expecting WoW can only be a hindrance
[5:27:25] portend: EverQuest crafting was very anxiety inducing. Upon the final combine if your skill wasn't high enough you could lose all the components if it failed.
[5:27:25] barely_casual_: I wish they'd just balance classes just a bit in classic to allow playability similar to current retail roles.
[5:27:26] Nalakitteh: @Zinaroth agree
[5:27:30] LemonDrizzleCakes: How bad is retail? its hard to gauge how bad it is because people are very toxic online in general
[5:27:38] Zakali: Yeah, always stones first
[5:27:39] rmelzer1986: I wonder what this expansion's version of Raubahn EX will be, haha.
[5:27:45] Zakali: as they become redundant quick
[5:27:46] SScloud: Why is everyone starting over on classic wow
[5:27:54] Biorrwolf: @lemondrizzlecakes it's not as fulfilling imo
[5:28:01] Aravarth: sharpening stones > grinding stones > actual blacskmithing
[5:28:03] Biorrwolf: @sscloud Season of Mastery
[5:28:22] barely_casual_: @SScloud  they removed world buffs and increase difficulty of bosses... some are playing "Hardcore" verison as well
[5:28:32] LemonDrizzleCakes: @Biorrwolf Is it as bad as people say? Comparing it to the other mainstream mmos?
[5:28:34] SScloud: Ahhhhh
[5:28:36] NotDillyTV: @lemondrizzlecakes it’s a way better experience for alts right now, than it has been in SL so it’s “better” imo
[5:28:38] Biorrwolf: Basically, harder Classic
[5:28:39] SScloud: Thank you !
[5:28:51] Nalakitteh: I can't wait for Lost Ark
[5:28:53] jezaknight93: you enjoying wow again @Towelliee
[5:28:54] shootdarn: does it matter what realm you do the hc mode on?
[5:28:55] Kromede: yeah but in wow you can walk on water!
[5:28:59] veryhairyheyyall: Lost ark was fun and different!
[5:29:14] barely_casual_: @shootdarn  most folks are focusing it on Mastery servers
[5:29:25] shootdarn: @pourmeadouble thank you :) was considering doing it
[5:29:29] NotDillyTV: @lemondrizzlecakes I do!
[5:29:46] GT_JamesATL: Is this a new character?
[5:29:55] veryhairyheyyall: I got into the bata for sure
[5:30:08] barely_casual_: @shootdarn I haven't looked into it too much but there may be a website (similar to Ironman on retail) that you sign in/up for and track your toons
[5:30:12] Nalakitteh: LUL used to that fast crafting
[5:30:16] luckfore: it looks cool but i hate click games
[5:30:43] Nalakitteh: I hope it comes out in January
[5:30:43] SicDogg: theres a HC mode on WoW now ??
[5:30:45] NotDillyTV: @lemondrizzlecakes I will admit I haven’t tried FF or Lost Ark because I’m still working on Mythic progression. New world wasn’t for me
[5:30:52] Aravarth: Just vendor them
[5:30:55] Aravarth: or give them to ppl in your guild
[5:30:57] king_julian_96: just vendor
[5:30:59] Thovarisk: Classic?
[5:31:03] barely_casual_: @SicDogg yes. community driven
[5:31:05] Terdnugget: vendor em for sure
[5:31:06] Reckless_Monk: Sadge
[5:31:21] Aravarth: Kappa
[5:31:22] Nalakitteh: I agree with that I can't see it coming out in March
[5:31:40] NotDillyTV: @lemondrizzlecakes I guess it depends what parts of wow you did enjoy or still do enjoy when it comes to retail
[5:31:42] azzurrin: I've always prefered controllers for AARPGS
[5:31:49] azzurrin: feels better to me
[5:31:50] MoonwalkingAngel: they should release wildstar 2 but for casuals no 40 man raids etc
[5:31:52] cikez: New World "Content" Kappa
[5:31:54] veryhairyheyyall: The WASD would be a huge move lol oh man..
[5:31:58] dewking93: the art style and clicking keep me from playing ff
[5:32:01] Nalakitteh: New world KEKW
[5:32:05] Pamito: Pamito subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 88 months! 
[5:32:21] Biorrwolf: @lemondrizzlecakes In my opinion, it's become a "wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle" situation. It's very new player friendly, which can be nice for a lot, but it is also lacking in a lot of areas for long time players. It's biggest downfall is how old content becomes irrelevant so quickly. Anything outside of the main xpac doesn't matter much. FFXIV for example helps to maintain old content relevance
[5:32:23] Brutalny: storage is an issue, only 7 people on my server so can't sell anything
[5:32:27] Biorrwolf: @lemondrizzlecakes WoW just has such a unique style that you can't find anywhere else. I'd recommend Classic before Retail. I personally play on Private Servers because I don't want to support Blizz financially at the moment
[5:32:30] Eternaalll: apparently there's new dupes right after they re-enabled the gold LUL
[5:32:42] Nalakitteh: Yeah ban the duper,  hopefully
[5:32:43] Zakali: @Towelliee Throwing weapons?
[5:32:52] Brutalny: end game crafting in new world doesn't work either
[5:32:53] NotDillyTV: @lemondrizzlecakes I enjoy the raid. Some fun bosses and I’ve had a lot of fun playing Arena with my friends. No stress and no toxicity dillyb5Spriest
[5:33:01] skeLEXtor: Because of the lack of WASD in lost ark, im thinking of using a controller.
[5:33:11] Attackroot: and general fixes to the clunkiness of the combat.
[5:33:19] bloodgulch_survivor: 14 silver damn bro, leave some for the rest of us
[5:33:39] kokochris: I used controller for ESO , it was fine
[5:33:39] mmo_kenna_: bro controller was legit
[5:33:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: i play ff14 with controller feels good but takes some adjusting
[5:34:03] azzurrin: It needs evergreen content like that
[5:34:05] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @LemonDrizzleCakes

[5:35:22] andycoin99: that soundfs great
[5:35:25] raldrik: dieing from falling to lose HC mode would suck
[5:35:28] HaloS23: @Towelliee Do you think Azeroth will be "remade" kind of thing or if she wakes up we move to another planet and itll be like WoW 2.0?

[5:36:09] jacethejouster: Shouldnt they change the name from New world to Old world since its not new anymore?
[5:36:10] iblighters: The only problem with that is the classes change so much in wow that some old content becomes weird
[5:36:23] TiredCarcass: its broke, its unplayable as is
[5:36:30] nuudelz: this guy needs help
[5:36:31] belfastcl: only streamers can explain the amount of hype that game had

[5:36:57] PhillyDilly18: Streamers are my go to source for news and input on any game. They take the bulk of the news and make it digestible for the common player.
[5:37:00] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  GOTTEM
[5:37:01] veryhairyheyyall: towRekt towRekt
[5:37:08] MrKhanes: Damn a lot of trolls today in chat!
[5:37:09] Aravarth: Flexing that HAMMER towRekt
[5:37:14] CaptainJoeyNY: Are people coming in here and talking shit? Do they not know who the fuck Toweliee is?
[5:37:16] Eternaalll: ye he malding LUL
[5:37:19] Silver_Lion: Madge
[5:37:19] DigitalZonez: streamers are the sole reason i bought new world
[5:37:21] 無職提督: so the guy is mad about Tow is right?
[5:37:24] theSalute: mad cuz bad! :O
[5:37:25] Seraedos: So, totally out of the loop. What is Season of Mastery?
[5:37:25] 無職提督: okay
[5:37:29] Siraeyou: Streamers were a stupidly strong marketing angle for New World
[5:37:36] Padarius: The biggest sin to the human being..."admitting they are wrong"
[5:37:36] Spaede: The hype was completely streamers lol. Even to the point where it was fake and overhyped for a crappy game
[5:37:44] sphynx_rayne: What did I come back too lol
[5:37:46] DigitalZonez: i dont regret it though even though i dont play it because i did enjoy it for a minute
[5:37:48] KythosMeltdown: its also that the MMO community is just hungry for new game always, and will hype the shittiest games for a month regardless of streamers
[5:37:51] SebasDaMann: New World will be a good game in a year or so... they have a lot of work to do
[5:37:52] jacethejouster: Streamers influence games so much tho thats common sense. Whats wrong with him. If it wasnt for you, asmon and esfand I doubt this new classic wow era would have as many people as it has.
[5:37:58] veryhairyheyyall: Madge towHAMUP
[5:37:58] CaptainJoeyNY: Well, in new worlds defense, BFNew world was fucking awesome. We didnt know how broken shit was
[5:38:05] Skylin3r: Streamers suck at games Kappa
[5:38:06] Natrilia: Any rewards for doing Ironman or just bragging rights?
[5:38:11] nuudelz: theres no game after hitting 60 and capping skills
[5:38:14] Spaede: Fake probably to strong
[5:38:19] Spaede: More like over enthusiastic
[5:38:23] Silver_Lion: okay :)
[5:38:27] Kromede: best game ever
[5:38:30] Demanisraar: So it's a shitshow LUL

[5:38:35] 無職提督: yea, i was grind for 200 crafting, but they just close the AH again, so maybe later
[5:38:40] Rottencoarse: @Skylin3r  damn sky calling out streamers :D
[5:38:44] Eternaalll: my server is down to like 150 people LUL
[5:38:46] bloodgulch_survivor: Not only did streamers move the needle, but it was smart and the right thing to do. Things are changing, this is the new gaming environment. It's irrelevant if you like it' or not.
[5:38:49] Skylin3r: what about BF2042?
[5:38:52] DigitalZonez: new world is a shit show but it has potential
[5:38:57] primordialskill: let's be real towelliee will play any MMO but so will I
[5:39:02] HaggisLaddie: barely even a game atm lol
[5:39:04] reyvin40: not enough fantasy for me in New World.  I like a lot of different race choices in my game
[5:39:21] thetrombonestorm: new world HAD potential now it's released and it needs a makeover already
[5:39:22] Balkep: 27? nice, I just hit 25
[5:39:24] Padarius: @reyvin40 same here
[5:39:25] Skylin3r: hit 50 yesterday, it's fun, just annoying servers
[5:39:26] abbosss: watch the reason they can't fix duping being because it's an issue with the base code KEKW
[5:39:30] talic420: they been finding and doing all they can find and fix issues they fucked up when in 2019 let go 85% of the staff working on the game
[5:39:33] dewking93: what version of addons do i download for som?
[5:39:35] alibynx: @reyvin40 ya I agree
[5:39:45] DigitalZonez: all i can say is vanguard is pretty dope and i wasnt going to buy it but my dad did and now im happy he did
[5:39:46] Skylin3r: yeah halo is fun stuff
[5:39:47] FireEmblemLord: i want the samurai one
[5:39:53] Aravarth: I mean, here's the thing. People don't like streamers because they don't like to believe people *they interact with* have more influence than they do on game development.
[5:39:56] mmo_kenna_: Halo infinite is so good
[5:40:00] Aravarth: It's just sour grapes.
[5:40:06] Balkep: @Skylin3r some stuff that was causing lag got disabled for now, so hoping less rubberbanding now, it was quite annoying
[5:40:14] HaloS23: @Towelliee Halo just feels good to play again. Played a bit last night and was amazed on how good it felt!!!
[5:40:27] Padarius: I just do what zygor tells me, i'm officially a robot
[5:40:29] theSalute: dude I love silverpine ^^
[5:40:32] Skylin3r: lol i was one of them proc nades users, so much XP from those
[5:40:39] Skylin3r: prox*
[5:40:40] Aravarth: It's the same reason people got bent out of shape when Twitch's streamer payments were released. They got bent out of shape that people whom they interact with are millionaires.
[5:40:54] Skylin3r: got it to T1 emblem
[5:40:57] Aravarth: Just sour grapes.
[5:40:59] theSalute: silverpine reminds me of when Sylvannas was called a bitch
[5:41:00] theSalute: lul
[5:41:07] Eternaalll: as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death Kappa
[5:41:15] brianlawl: ok aravarth enough insight plz lmao. you don't know everything
[5:41:16] caulk2big69: sadge
[5:41:16] cikez: LUL
[5:41:23] Hallwack: vanguard must be the worst cod in a long time
[5:41:24] Thoreya: everyone out and about
[5:41:28] SlowMoJoe_TV: how close has he come to dying?
[5:41:28] tiekfu: well it is the smallest pve server
[5:41:29] Eternaalll: I saw like 3-4 people pass u the whole 5hours LUL
[5:41:29] DegenerateHaven: actually empty tho wtf
[5:41:30] Buttscratchrr: This hardcore mode gave me a spark for wow this is kewl as hell!
[5:41:31] tiekfu: lol
[5:41:33] talrios: everyone stayed up all night lol
[5:41:35] TheItalianStallion321: anyone selling boosts yet in Season of Mastery? kekw, just kidding
[5:41:36] theSalute: empty org so sadge
[5:41:40] primordialskill: when did server open for HC classic
[5:41:43] abbosss: @aravarth a lot of people have an unhealthy parasocial relationship with streamers because they think they can "relate" so when their bubble is popped, you can imagine KEKW
[5:41:44] DigitalZonez: atleast your not me playing retail WoW
[5:42:00] Brutalny: what did you think was happening when streamers just play a game for a week and drop it, they getting a bag
[5:42:11] T0MMYT: KEKW
[5:42:11] Aravarth: @abbosss Oh, for sure. Asmon has even gone on lengths talking about how parasocial relationships are unhealthy.
[5:42:16] Radiag: @Brutalny variety streamers?
[5:42:20] theSalute: shadowlands may have taken your soul tho
[5:42:20] thetrombonestorm: if you get paid at work the feelings you have about work are genuine
[5:42:28] Gregadeaux: Just checked Server Pops. Shadowstrike (PvE east) and Jom are Full. Obsidian and Barman are High
[5:42:33] Brutalny: the last year almost all streamers radiag
[5:42:53] Mr_F00L: what is HC mode? :)
[5:42:54] Skylin3r: yeah new world is special, just them bugs PepeWhy
[5:42:57] Radiag: and other people cant try out games for a week and move on? They gotta stick with it for months to be genuine?
[5:42:57] Eternaalll: Kids these days Kappa
[5:43:07] Eternaalll: the one behind
[5:43:09] zgarbunia_official: left end of road
[5:43:09] nevets_i: Towel do you think we will get another wow expansion?
[5:43:11] Biotechz: @Mr_F00L if he dies while leveling he restarts
[5:43:17] Eternaalll: middle tent at the end
[5:43:19] Brutalny: it is good, everybody got to make a living
[5:43:20] talrios: weapon skill? all the way back
[5:43:20] caulk2big69: I miss the days when WoW wasn't dead
[5:43:26] KythosMeltdown: people also dont really realize how hard streaming is lmao
[5:43:26] Eternaalll: yep
[5:43:40] Eternaalll: Poggers
[5:43:44] Mr_F00L: @Biotechz only as lvling? or also max lvl?
[5:43:44] racketpunch: What’s the plan in SoM if you die?
[5:43:46] Aravarth: @Towelliee I mean, it's the same reason I get bent out of shape when others say "Oh, you academics don't know what you're talking about". Like no, I literally have a PhD. It's my job to know what I'm talking about. That's why I trust streamers' opinions. They're the equivalent experts in games.
[5:43:56] thetrombonestorm: @eternaalll mvp
[5:44:03] theSalute: yeeehaw ! :D
[5:44:05] Eternaalll: so xp is boosted but gold rates still the same right? Sadge
[5:44:18] zgarbunia_official: at the gate of orgrimar
[5:44:24] Rexialiton: I've played wow for 15 years and the only break i've ever taken was in Legion because i should move apartment and i didnt have time. 1.5years later i returned to wow. Always loved the game in its good and bad times
[5:44:24] KythosMeltdown: @Eternaalll they nerfed mount costs
[5:44:26] theSalute: @Eternaalll omg true, so you will blow thgrough levels and pay for skills but not make more gold D:
[5:44:28] Yetik: God i wish i could use bows as a warrior in retail LUL
[5:44:33] Eternaalll: @KythosMeltdown oh SHIT
[5:44:33] Biotechz: @Mr_F00L just leveling a believe
[5:44:34] The_Farting_Spaniard: ammo guy in the front of orgrimmar
[5:44:35] TheRavenGrave: Real gamers don't talk crap about games and they don't talk crap about gamers.
[5:44:35] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:44:38] Carahail: Go to the bower
[5:44:38] Eternaalll: ok time to ressub Kappa
[5:44:45] Seraedos: So Season of Mastery is just Classic with faster leveling and tougher dungeon/raid bosses? And what's the Soul of Iron
[5:44:51] Mr_F00L: @Biotechz aight ch8eers
[5:44:55] Mr_F00L: cheers
[5:45:01] Eternaalll: @KythosMeltdown how much is it now?
[5:45:05] Padarius: i'm just happy to live in a time where we get some a nice variety of games
[5:45:13] KythosMeltdown: @Eternaalll think about 50% less
[5:45:25] Brutalny: i think that it should be labeled though, and I don't think that is happening across the board
[5:45:37] kokochris: It's people trying to chase the streamer gaming cycle; thats insane.
[5:45:53] geraldtgnome: @Towelliee , spinal surgery all done, 2 new disks in my neck and scaffolding up my spine, 6 weeks in a collar so plenty of time for hammer squad
[5:46:00] Reckless_Monk: YEP
[5:46:01] SoFloMjaytee: They don’t know understand the  promotional/business side from a company’s perspective
[5:46:09] PvtHudson093: back in my day you got 1 game for your birthday and if it was crap you had to wait till Xmas for another one
[5:46:30] DegenerateHaven: blizzard sleeping on that forever now
[5:46:33] The_Farting_Spaniard: you passed the ammo guy
[5:46:51] TheRealPabloSanchez: did they add group finder to SOM? some hardcore wowheads hate that but im a big fan
[5:46:53] zgarbunia_official: left
[5:46:58] Ndurppa: yes
[5:46:58] Hallwack: they got the money, but cant fix their game kekW

[5:47:09] Thovarisk: awww man i miss this orgrimar
[5:47:14] Eternaalll: i thought you'd know every npc in the game by now Kappa
[5:47:16] TheRealPabloSanchez: @kokochris awesome!
[5:47:22] CCG_337: I just come here from time to time, to see people talking shit about ffxiv and look the game is doing great. mostly opinions are from. people not paying the game.
[5:47:24] cikez: To be fair, AGS does have a shitton of Dev jobs posted... So they are trying
[5:47:40] KythosMeltdown: The problem with New World is Agile development
[5:47:44] Th3IceCr3amMan: the problem has to do with greedy suits wanting the game to be out
[5:47:45] Brutalny: new world is totally toast atm, it is a single player game for most servers
[5:47:45] Gregadeaux: Didn't you know towellie? Fixing bugs just means paying the bugs to go away
[5:47:47] TheRavenGrave: Now all new world has to do is add raiding to there game and they might be set
[5:47:52] TheRealPabloSanchez: @CasualCarvalho I think ffxiv is great but that art style is not for me
[5:47:56] KythosMeltdown: Amazons MO is to design their way out of problems as they arise
[5:48:01] Mooonwarden: where/how do i turn on HC mode
[5:48:03] KythosMeltdown: and that dont work for a game
[5:48:07] Hallwack: @Towelliee aye man, played 450h of new world so cant complain too much i guess, i got way over my moneys worth already!
[5:48:19] Eternaalll: u going prot ?
[5:48:34] Brutalny: im still playing new world, all you can do is hope for the best.  I think amazon will give them 6 months then abandon
[5:48:41] geraldtgnome: @Towelliee , spinal surgery all done, 2 new disks in my neck and scaffolding up my spine, 6 weeks in a collar so plenty of time for hammer squad
[5:48:44] Eternaalll: HC mode only counts for raids right?

[5:52:54] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[5:52:57] Brutalny: it is crazy now, all cities abandoned on my server no chat.  I saw one dude and he had all max gear the entire map is purple
[5:52:58] SoFloMjaytee: It’s hilarious!!!!!!

[5:53:03] Dabl0: hey I'm also doing the HC challenge on Obsidian edge is there a harcore guild or we just going for it?

[5:53:21] Amarlian: Allegedly there is a shareholder letter that is asking Kotick to Resign. but it doesn't say how big the group is now
[5:53:26] TheRealPabloSanchez: kek
[5:53:28] SoFloMjaytee: It’s so true!!!
[5:53:37] Eternaalll: @Towelliee i think u can google the NW horse meme LUL. 10/10 worth it
[5:53:39] Balkep: typical gaming subreddit
[5:53:49] FergusCreative: I think the worst part is the amount of delays it had and still had shit wrong
[5:53:54] shootdarn: @Towelliee been watching you for almost 10 years man, thanks  for all the memories. always a good day watching your stream!

[6:00:38] SteveSD: voidbent is cheap a f to get
[6:00:39] Eternaalll: void ore on my server is like 20k LUL
[6:00:43] TheGamerME: froma developers slant. it's not easy to  make your own game engine and to make a game with it on top of it. theres a reasonw hy  game engines like unreal are so popular.  there all built and the developer just has to make the game and not worry about  the game engine
[6:00:46] Eternaalll: cause there;s like sub 100 players..
[6:01:08] kironash_: the survivor title is a fake so?
[6:01:13] maccaruso: Ironman run as a warrior.  You got some balls.
[6:01:16] Eternaalll: 535
[6:01:17] 無職提督: no, they nerf it
[6:01:30] minirine_: the 520 faction gear is not nearly as strong as voidbent now that they semi fixed resillient
[6:01:31] Eternaalll: they fixed resilient perk.
[6:01:42] bloodymoco: we got  WW everfall reekwater brightwood restless shore ebonscale reach
[6:01:45] 無職提督: but still dense for a fresh 60
[6:01:51] Hallwack: "nerfed" dont you mean fixed?
[6:01:59] TheTieThatBinds: lets hope they move from Crytek to UE5 in the future...

[6:02:32] Eternaalll: lumberyard.
[6:02:38] TheGamerME: it's a moddfied crytek
[6:02:45] Eternaalll: it was one of the cryengine itterations.
[6:02:52] Eternaalll: but they customized it a bit.
[6:02:55] Kon_Soul: correct
[6:03:24] Eternaalll: from what i heard lumberyard is good,but their coding is bad and poor netcode.
[6:03:48] TheGamerME: well they open sourced it fully now. lumberyard is called o3de now and it was by the lunix foundation
[6:03:49] Eternaalll: Anthem LUL

[6:04:45] Eternaalll: Kappa
[6:04:51] EclipserEU: the only iron man type of gameplay game :(
[6:04:56] Rudric_Ice: did they make the mount drop rate to 100% bcuz of the allegations against kotick Kappa
[6:05:07] FranciscoTheMage: is it still possible to log into anthem though?

[6:07:15] Eternaalll: they won't be in that mode. I think if shit goes really sideways they will just pull the plug and focus on LA LUL
[6:07:27] Mason1161: @zombietaint ty
[6:08:00] CaptainJoeyNY: its a head that drops that starts a quest
[6:08:04] Brutalny: they were smart to disable gold transfers and auction house, it made the gold sellers move on
[6:08:09] TheNothingness: nothing like exploits to ruin a game
[6:08:12] TheItalianStallion321: thats a drop quest item Towelliee. kinda annoying to get
[6:08:12] SexWhen: are u even 200 fishing in nw ?
[6:08:14] Clicklesly: But surely the dupers will stop when they get that sever punishment of 24 hr suspension Kappa
[6:08:27] TheGamerME: it was  very ballsey of square to shut down  ARR after putting all the money into the gam. but it worked ot in the long run
[6:08:30] Eternaalll: and them removing 98% of dupped gold is pure pr talk,even with all telemetry i somehow doubt it,cause they aren't even able to fix basic shit,how would they be able to pull off somehting of that scale LUL
[6:08:32] FranciscoTheMage: i still feel like the poison pill was the panic at release. they should have not release SO MANY new servers. they hated the bad PR the queues gave them
[6:08:45] 3663Sharad: IMO New World is "fine" for the casuals
[6:08:51] The_Noob_Police: i havent been excited for  game of lost ark cause most games lately have been hot garbo
[6:08:51] Eternaalll: 100%
[6:08:53] coffeetimeeeee: Yes
[6:08:57] SexWhen: many quit including me till merger happens, my server has 20--200 ppl
[6:08:57] 無職提督: yea
[6:08:58] FranciscoTheMage: what new dupes
[6:09:01] Brutalny: yea, everything is .01 on auction house I think they are going to shut it down
[6:09:06] 3663Sharad: EU seems fine ?
[6:09:11] Buttscratchrr: That was a huge.... turn off no AH for almost 2 days
[6:09:12] officialviz: officialviz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 28 months dad.
[6:09:18] SexWhen: this duping is delaying mergers :<
[6:09:23] 3663Sharad: Oh the last days i see
[6:09:27] Mason1161: I’ve heard you can even dupe from the storage boxes. Doesn’t have to be trade
[6:09:34] Eternaalll: i mainly play the Markets so, this shit is a red flag for me.
[6:09:46] CaptainJoeyNY: good luck with the iron man Towel
[6:09:49] Eternaalll: wanted to reach my 200k gold goal Sadge
[6:09:54] Brutalny: it is not even worth it to dupe, no benefit really except losing your game
[6:09:55] TheTieThatBinds: no RFC?! aren't you about RFC's level?
[6:09:57] Brodih_: what does that buff give you ?
[6:10:05] officialviz: I havent shown my resub in like 7 months because of work, nice to be able to catch the stream again.
[6:10:15] FranciscoTheMage: @Brutalny exactly but i think gold sellers are the problem
[6:10:20] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @DoctorBoom (warning)
[6:10:22] Diminted: lol
[6:10:36] FranciscoTheMage: why dont they do like WOW and monitor huge intakes of gold and ban the people buying gold too
[6:10:39] Watershots: @Towelliee New world's fix for the furnishing dupe was to disable trading, dropping, selling of furnishing items. If you happen to craft a bunch of furnishing items and get encumbered your just fucked lol
[6:10:40] Kali_shiv: Why is toweliee relvling again in classic?
[6:10:42] Hallwack: ´staysafe is

[6:11:47] dogo_person: you cant see bags...
[6:11:47] Eternaalll: i want to play this,but the servers seem so dead LUL
[6:11:50] TwitchPlusMe: that's messed up lol
[6:11:52] FranciscoTheMage: did they disable decorate? cause i couldn't put a trophy in my houe
[6:11:59] Tharia: being encumbered is so annoying
[6:12:01] TheTieThatBinds: did they fix the encumbered bug where you could run around while encumbered?
[6:12:06] belfastcl: feels bad for the devs
[6:12:08] Brodih_: You need to avoid any quest thats in a cave also
[6:12:12] Brutalny: i still see the pumpkins and stuff on peoples houses
[6:12:22] Eternaalll: stutter steppin LUL
[6:12:35] TheTieThatBinds: it was fantastic for ore farming
[6:12:38] theSalute: it was so funny
