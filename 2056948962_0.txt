I have a knack for being able to eat paper with ease.Once I made an embarrassing drawing so I ripped the paper up and ate it piece by piece. I then went on to test my wits against a piece of cardboard. Before you could look, it was gone. My ability to eat boxes surpasses my ability to eat box. I'm sure that I'd easily be able to eat the happy meal box with little effort.
