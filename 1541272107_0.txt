[0:42:24] dwolters_the_zombieman: @mrgattz hi been a while since I saw you how are you doing buddy
[0:42:43] strchsr: I don't think Asmon is worried about money when he is millionaire and still spends like $6 a day on fast food and basically nothing else
[0:42:44] Q_TheDreamer: @MrGattz he will never "need" money again, what are you on lmao
[0:43:25] MrGattz: @dwolters_the_zombieman doing great! working a lot lately. dont really get to hang with the stream as much as i used to unfortunately but im still behind the scenes! how are you?
[0:43:43] Glorpylol: 43 mins? did he afk???
[0:43:56] Q_TheDreamer: Towellie intros are usually this long if not longer
[0:44:01] strchsr: I do hope he's doing alright though, and that he'd use some of that money for upkeep on his house; I remember back in February it was really cold in Texas and his house basically had no heating so he was just using electric blankets?
[0:44:03] dwolters_the_zombieman: @mrgattz I'm good
[0:44:56] sshadeh: YEP
[0:45:02] Glorpylol: so i guess click his stream at an hour mark to see content?

[0:46:18] Glorpylol: well i dont join at start times tbh
[0:46:19] Thoreya: lol wtf
[0:46:20] MrGattz: @q9kyu for sure. but then why do hollywood millionaires and famous sports ball players keep doing their thing if they are already richer than 80% of the world? its not cause they need the money lol asmon just has the advantage of not needing to consistently work daily
[0:47:30] Glorpylol: i just seen a person i like to watch was live a clicked and that was it lol
[0:47:42] strchsr: @MrGattz I just wish Asmon would take better care of himself and get his house fixed up; he has the money for it, there's no need to not have proper heating/cooling, in my opinion, if money isn't a factor
[0:47:54] dwolters_the_zombieman: even rich people go broke because they don't spend their money wisely

[1:10:32] andrejhmm: @Towelliee Dk seems super weird to me now that you can take talents that were before exclusive to specs. It's hard to theory craft when you don't know how things synergize because they never did before. What's your Blood Dk take on that?
[1:10:50] SirVoro: @Towelliee have you done intermittent fasting before? I think I am gonna start that up today.

[1:19:39] TacDuc: @TacDuc I know, I main BDK, but just that if it dealt the healing from Death Strike in shadow damage, then it would break a lot of encounters

[1:48:50] zuna1904: feral is literally the same as shadowlands
[1:48:54] zuna1904: right now
[1:48:56] Jarwerewolf: haha
[1:49:01] ModestAce: warlock
[1:49:15] Strouss: not sure why but the last time i really lioked boomkin was Mount Hyjal raid.

[1:49:16] Carlenzo: hassent feral been the same shit since forever LUL
[1:49:25] strchsr: @Towelliee Man, imagine if we get that funny crystal talent back for mage like we had in WoD
[1:49:53] Blvdman: missing passives etc
[1:49:56] zuna1904: feral has just shifted dmg from bleeds to bites. but still the same since dunno cata ?:D
[1:50:08] DAN_I_E_L_: That is basically my major issue with the talents. I hoped we would get some big changes to specs, but no... It's basically the same again.
[1:50:32] zuna1904: ignored by blizzard for years. Mage sucks for 1week... "Oh we are so sorry heres your 500% dmg buffs"
[1:50:41] sshadeh: borrowed power is usually passives mostly too
[1:50:43] Blvdman: I think we were hoping we would get current + some more
[1:50:44] DecayedmiNt: Baer make Moonfire go brrrrrrrrr
[1:50:58] sshadeh: and on some classes you can take a lot of talents at the same time, which you couldnt have befor
[1:51:03] Scandeless: world of evokers KEKW
[1:51:15] strchsr: @Towelliee If only they were good lol
[1:51:23] mayonaes: It is easier to create passives that change the dynamic or functionality of existing spells
[1:51:30] Finiin: Mage fire/frost always does well. I want Arcane mage to be good
[1:51:31] mayonaes: Than adding brand new spells
[1:51:44] htomek: Arcane mage is whack, they need to remove it and add lightning mage
[1:51:47] strike879: i just hope my main still feel as my main and not as a reroll
[1:51:50] sshadeh: too bad shadowpriest has some shitty passives that block the good talents at the bottom
[1:51:50] Shenri: Hey @Towelliee how you enjoying Alpha so far?
[1:51:53] strchsr: @Towelliee Yeah uh Yogg-Saron is bugged, it says every 50 Shadowy Apparitions, but it's every 50 Mind Blast/Devouring Plague casts
[1:52:01] zuna1904: shadow is messy
[1:52:03] fokeriser: @htomek you do know that mages exclusively use arcane magic right
[1:52:05] scumlucki: Arcane mage is literallyjust arcane missles its kinda lame
[1:52:13] fokeriser: and fire/frost is simply conversion of arcane
[1:52:16] rival_xo: wonder if we get class halls again pog
[1:52:19] mavericks312: @Finiin i need that wrath arcane to make a comeback
[1:52:24] Scandeless: Kappa
[1:52:26] mayonaes: I would be down for changing arcane mage to lightning
[1:52:32] hakaeltn: hey man, do you use any vitamin supplements
[1:52:35] htomek: @fokeriser Never really looked so deeply into it but thats interesting I guess
[1:52:39] mayonaes: Then ele shaman will be mad
[1:52:50] sshadeh: @mayonaes that would be too similar to ele
[1:52:51] abracka_: does anyone in chat know if crusader is worth it for mage tower still?
[1:52:54] htomek: If they convert fire and frost from arcane energy then why not lightning?>

[1:53:06] Shenri: awesome mate
[1:53:12] sshadeh: @htomek elementalist already has a lot of lightning and blind spells

[1:53:44] Finiin: if they make arcane good i'd be back to mage as my main
[1:53:51] Gaius_Yae_Baelsar: Are there new class abilities with the new talent trees or is it all passive effects?
[1:54:22] abracka_: spriest is the new edging class
[1:54:35] sshadeh: other dps have like 1-3 decent damage points to get into strong talents in the end, shadow priest has 5 shitty ones to get one good talent
[1:54:45] Jarwerewolf: hahaha
[1:54:57] sshadeh: like some of them are just tiny bit of passive defence
[1:55:05] strchsr: @Towelliee And C'Thun is just the tentacle legendary from SL, N'Zoth is a weaker version of the Echoing Void corruption and Y'Shaarj is like, IQD the talent

[1:55:27] htomek: I've been lvling sub rogue and my dps has been so bad. Any tips? Only lvl 26 rn so maybe it gets better at 60?
[1:55:30] zuna1904: would have been the perfect time to split shadow and give priest a 4th spec with Void. but no. lets suffer more
[1:55:39] szble: is there anyone on alliance
[1:55:41] MaleFrom73: @nelo_vergilo Search for "Dragonflight Talent Calculator" on wow head. You will find all the released talents there
[1:55:52] Kisswani: all 5 alpha testers are logged in
[1:55:55] abracka_: @htomek don't worry or focus about your dps at lv 26
[1:56:01] Finiin: @Towelliee I started a bear tank yesterday on retail. I never tanked before any tips for a new tank?
[1:56:04] luckfore: horde is dead bruh
[1:56:07] Korupcija_: I'm surprised they didn't expand cross faction stuff for 10.0
[1:56:14] htomek: @abracka_ I ran a dungeon and did less dps than my tank LMAO
[1:56:21] Reckless_Monk: dwarfz are dumb looking
[1:56:23] thymos_: @Finiin always blame the DPS when things go wrong
[1:56:37] luckfore: all the cool kids switched to ally
[1:56:38] szble: yeah no idea why we have no cross faction dungeon finder
[1:56:39] shalfey4: I still don't get it why Evoker class is "ADVANCED"
[1:56:42] Gaius_Yae_Baelsar: @MaleFrom73 Thank you!!
[1:56:48] Finiin: @Thymos_  Thats a good tip lol
[1:56:55] zMalloc: Like Pandas I think the Dragon race looks so bad. So I doubt I'll ever play them
[1:56:55] htomek: I'm debating switching to alliance cause of DID and void elves honestly
[1:56:59] thymos_: KEKW
[1:57:03] abracka_: @htomek you might find more success with playing outlaw for now truthfully
[1:57:12] htomek: Evoker has a tank spec?
[1:57:20] zarenadt: @htomek no
[1:57:21] Exoduc: I like being a Felbear, tanking is just a sideeffect
[1:57:22] jetributions: no
[1:57:22] strike879: if faction change was free allot more would go alliance ppl went horde for more ppl / power now when thats less they cba to pay again to go back
[1:57:27] szble: idk preservation seems tough
[1:57:31] sshadeh: it shouldnt need that crappy "advanced" typing thing, like DK didnt need either
[1:57:39] Strouss: i wasnt that way i until i did bear and Monk with 4 set. this expac.  Allways healed in the past.
[1:57:41] Cafe0le: the healer spec is much more complex than the dps one
[1:57:45] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[1:57:48] Thoreya: we goin back to islands boys
[1:57:52] Strouss: Now i cant get enough tanking.
[1:57:58] scumlucki: evoker tank when?
[1:58:01] Cakeabsorber: Healer service modCheck
[1:58:12] zarenadt: I kinda miss island expeditions LUL
[1:58:26] htomek: @abracka_ word. I'll give it a try but I just don't care for the whole pirate aesthetic it has going
[1:58:29] mavericks312: on live why would you go alliance lol
[1:58:38] Rabidkittens: how does cross faction guilds work?
[1:58:40] scumlucki: now all we need is cross region gameplay
[1:58:40] strchsr: @Towelliee Island Expeditions are unironically a good way to make gold
[1:58:43] Djfarmville: @zarenadt Being able to mass group everything and use the zerite beam, FeelsBadMan
[1:59:10] zarenadt: @Djfarmville the pvp version was fun too
[1:59:16] shalfey4: I'm still waiting when blizzard it going to revive legacy expansions. right now they're quite irrelevant expect tmog runs and ez questing
[1:59:31] htomek: or just make alliance not suck
[1:59:33] ijuki: 10 man mythic would be nice ... but won't happen
[1:59:47] kokochris: that it all next 10000 players are gnomes
[2:00:01] letdownlarry: I just love alliance cities way more
[2:00:02] Strouss: I hope for cross faction guilds.
[2:00:06] botscast: what do u mean they cant force it? they forced 90% of playerbase to play horde till now :D
[2:00:11] DAN_I_E_L_: I thought communities would replace guilds long term. But they seem to just have abandoned communities.
[2:00:28] Djfarmville: razorfin set
[2:00:28] luckfore: hope next build adds more of the new ui stuff
[2:00:29] Inthezonewow: Yeah they're almost rarer because less are doing islands
[2:00:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: The transmogs from island expeditions sell for crazy amounts
[2:00:34] strchsr: @Towelliee The Duskhaven Top Hat, I got and sold for 400k
[2:00:34] MacroWaver: I made 400k off the stinkrot smasher
[2:00:35] stealthx23: easy make one racial broken in alliance that world first faction change cause of it
[2:01:16] stealthx23: then everyone will change
[2:01:25] stealthx23: meta shiz
[2:01:27] strike879: the problem is the rankings blizz is on one side we dont bother with world first race but on the other they limit stuff by not allowing xrealm mythic untill HoF is full

[2:04:02] SirVoro: They full nerfed that right?
[2:04:07] shalfey4: btw did they changed a size of quest log?
[2:04:46] Keyastaron_: IMO i think we should have UNLIMITED quests
[2:04:46] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[2:05:00] stealthx23: should of kept it for population lol
[2:05:10] Inthezonewow: Do you think they will open up other classes for Dracthyr? @Towelliee
[2:05:19] LearnedSomething: it doesn't have to be completely overpowered tho
[2:05:26] Diamondead1: its still crazy horde has all dps racials, meanwhile alliance has most utility ones
[2:05:29] LearnedSomething: all it has to do is give you a tiny edge in the mythic raid
[2:05:54] UltraContent: more honor SMOrc
[2:06:05] Peqdevil: snowball effect
[2:06:17] stealthx23: it will be Domino effect...meta guys will move so will there friends

[2:22:13] Blas0n: Good morning @towelliee
[2:22:17] Kisswani: @kokochris if we had the trust system in wow there will be a million youtube videos about how " Blizzard is killing the social aspect of the game "
[2:22:30] abracka_: LOL
[2:22:42] strchsr: That guy needs to seek medical attention
[2:22:44] ElDrakenMan: @towelliee what are your thoughts on the current state of New World? Will you be returning?
[2:22:52] Badziee: true
[2:22:55] maccaruso: I do take care of my body.  It's wonderfully round.

[2:23:01] abracka_: you booze you lose, drink yoohoo
[2:23:02] geokouts: Say NO to Drugs!
[2:23:03] br3z: i only do cope
[2:23:07] kokochris: @kisswani probably, I think it's pretty cool tho.  you want to drop in quick and run it
[2:23:07] br3z: towCopium
[2:23:19] tikerrtv: this self healing seems really underwhelming
[2:23:37] ahies28: Drugs are bad ...mmk
[2:23:44] kokochris: towHAMUP
[2:23:53] Tybow0811: Are there no addons for all of alpha or just for the first couple of phases?
[2:23:55] Kisswani: @kokochris and a way for solo players to experience dungeons and maybe parts of raids
[2:23:56] Blas0n: Am I High chat or does those Buttons actually look more detailed?
[2:24:07] asmodai4823: DK healing scales with damage taken
[2:24:08] Blas0n: Did they improve the art of the buttons?
[2:24:13] Strouss: Deathstrike is what you "live" for on a DK lol
[2:24:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: We can see the self-healing in the logs after, it's not as constant as bear, but bigger chunks and absorbs
[2:24:24] kokochris: @kisswani for sure.  right now of you want to pug a raid, it's pretty hard to find a group
[2:24:48] headshot_hunter6: will be interesting to see whether pallys keep ashen hallow or divine toll
[2:25:06] Edorasthegamer: @Binx0811 beta will allow addons but not alpha
[2:25:10] nagkinn: anyone know what talent tress will come out next?
[2:25:10] zgag: Speaking of movie trailers. Got to admit that Black Adam looks pretty good.  Seems the Rock was made for that role

[2:25:20] Strouss: booo ashen hollow, yay DT  @headshot_hunter6

[2:30:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: dead in the water... because you can't swim in it Kappa
[2:30:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: They keep doing updates for New World, but it's stil kind of scuffed
[2:30:07] Alienfromger: maintanance mode
[2:30:10] fokeriser: free to play=server shutting down within 2 years KKEW
[2:30:13] fokeriser: KEKW
[2:30:24] thymos_: the MMO cycle
[2:30:26] king_julian_96: so you will not be playing season 4  of SL in just under 2 weeks towelliee
[2:30:31] abracka_: NW is hovering around 12k average players. not looking great, numbers keep dropping every month more and more
[2:30:34] maccaruso: SWTOR has been free-to-play for over six years
[2:30:37] EclipserEU: they did server merge recently
[2:30:44] zarenadt: 'established' = on life support LUL LUL LUL
[2:30:45] berserker_strike: When is next build is coming out mr streamer ? :.D @Towelliee
[2:30:55] fokeriser: @maccaruso if they have 1 guy running it Kappa
[2:30:58] Strouss: i wont go back till they atleast have a whole new continent to explore.
[2:30:59] MimikTheMonk: A big relaunch/expansion event is the only way theyll revive a playerbase
[2:31:00] manmower: the PVE started out too barebones in NW to keep players
[2:31:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: I want that greatsword in New World, but like the crafting is still such a pain in ass
[2:31:03] xhaven: @fokeriser nope thats not true anymore ESO, SWTOR, and more all went f2p and did well
[2:31:03] LearnedSomething: they still haven't put swimming in
[2:31:10] thymos_: just make single player RPGs fuck MMOs :)
[2:31:11] Kisswani: do you expect any new MMO to have vanillia wow amounts of content ? @Towelliee
[2:31:14] LearnedSomething: you literally walk along the bottom of every lake and river
[2:31:26] Note: What is that background music ?
[2:31:32] DoubleNova: they might be dead in the water tbh
[2:31:37] king_julian_96: so you will not be playing season 4 of SL in just under 2 weeks towelliee
[2:31:41] Note: !Spotify
[2:31:44] Alienfromger: amazon focus more on lost ark
[2:31:48] sLogOG: what content did vanilla wow had? @Kisswani
[2:31:50] manmower: whoever came up with the idea of pvp focus doomed it
[2:31:52] Crisis88: They released the game in a horrible spot just because nothing else was near the release. Now it's dying slowly because it wasn't great.
[2:31:55] fokeriser: copyThis
[2:32:08] Korupcija_: it sold minimum 1M copies
[2:32:15] Kisswani: @sLogOG just the leveling alone , the amount of zones , dungeons , raids eventually
[2:32:15] Finansdepartementet: rip wildstar
[2:32:17] belfastcl: amazon was pouring half a billion a year on the ags division, would be interesting to know how much went into nw
[2:32:23] LearnedSomething: it showed a lot of promise
[2:32:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: New World can be fixed, there's a lot of good stuff, but things like their server merges have routinely been a big hassle
[2:32:26] LearnedSomething: and then it fell flat :(
[2:32:29] thymos_: wildstar OMEGALUL
[2:32:32] raye_gaming22: and both gmaes got  butchered by amazon lol
[2:32:35] WSeveryn: not enough pve, and to big of a pain to get dungeon keys
[2:32:43] sLogOG: every new mmorpg has that then @Kisswani
[2:32:45] thymos_: "pro" wow players were so hyped
[2:32:48] Crisis88: MMO market just kind of held by WoW, FF14 and GW2
[2:32:51] relbain1: @Towelliee How are the tanks feeling in early alpha
[2:32:52] kyagi1002: What do you think about the blood dk Tank in dragonflight?
[2:33:02] mrwilsoncw: towBeer
[2:33:05] Jiraiya110: lost ark is sort of big
[2:33:17] king_julian_96: so you will not be playing season 4 of SL in just under 2 weeks towelliee cause i checked we got season 4 in 10 days
[2:33:20] manmower: new MMO needs to launch with a lot of content
[2:33:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: GW2 and ESO have gotten way better over the years, yeah
[2:33:21] raye_gaming22: LA has 100k players and 100k bots roaming in a 50/50 take

[2:33:49] TheItalianStallion321: since i wont be getting alpha or beta DF, i just started playing SWTOR and im am loving it. i joined a guild with 15+ people online every day @Towelliee

[2:35:24] sshadeh: Kappa
[2:35:25] Jiraiya110: it shows interest in the game but not sub counts
[2:35:36] Kasra25: watchable doesn't mean playable, I watch overwatch but I an not touching that game...

[2:36:22] Pannekaker: @Towelliee I love when people use Google search metrics to "determine" the number of WoW players, like older players probably don't Google WoW a lot, we know which sites to go to and such
[2:36:26] EliteKibbles: how do we get to play dragonflight !!!
[2:36:28] Holysal: the big WoW subs in the past really wrapped ppls minds on how a mmo is successful
[2:36:33] v2_Rootz: yeah people are really dumb with the concurrent vs unique concept
[2:36:39] LiftsAndLoot: What’s the deal with tanks in dragonflight so far, who’s looking fun/good?

[2:37:09] EliteKibbles: XD only so many people get to play it before its release?
[2:37:14] thymos_: how many of them are real life criminals monkaS
[2:37:28] sshadeh: blood DK with currently available 60 lvl talent points is pretty similar to current one
[2:37:38] avat707: do you get the full talent points at 70 now?
[2:37:48] Valient491: I want alpha so badly. I want to test out my classes
[2:37:51] luckfore: @vallier933 atm only a handful yet, with Beta next month alot more will be invited

[2:37:54] sshadeh: @avat707 they still playing with 60 lvl talents
[2:38:01] king_julian_96: so you will not be playing season 4 of SL in just under 2 weeks towelliee when season 4 goes live iam just curious if you will or keep playing alpha cause we got 10 days till season 4 towelliee
[2:38:02] avat707: stupid
[2:38:17] copterskates: same but different
[2:38:20] thymos_: KEKW
[2:38:20] Valient491: When I preordered dragonflight my heart paused for half a second when I saw the launcher change icons to dragonflight thinking I got access lol
[2:38:30] king_julian_96: imagine this dungeon mythic plus
[2:38:33] luckfore: the portraits etc will be updated next build
[2:38:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the UI does look better, and I can't wait to be able to edit and move all the stuff
[2:38:36] PurplePenguinGamer: werent we supposed to get new unit frames?
[2:38:36] LiftsAndLoot: Is warrior looking any good in dragonflight
[2:38:40] shalfey4: can you move those spell bars?
[2:38:41] Electafuzz: @poraxiss Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:38:53] The_PatientZero: can you move the buffs and debuffs?

[2:39:37] Valient491: yeah ass
[2:39:45] frekiundgeri: thx
[2:39:52] raye_gaming22: the autoattacked lol
[2:39:53] Imprison3d: @Towelliee how old are you?
[2:40:08] mrelgaato: 40 + lvl
[2:40:23] Rayao: what about bonestorm healing ?
[2:40:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Let's see those heals
[2:40:55] sshadeh: its great that they added that
[2:40:59] sshadeh: blood DK needs more dmg YEP
[2:41:06] Araphas: has that talent existed before in any way?
[2:41:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Damn, that healer is a pumper
[2:41:24] nyx_helios: disc priest gone
[2:41:34] sshadeh: mistweaver dragon
[2:41:37] Valient491: idk the rogues talents but that seems like a very single target focussed build structure
[2:41:47] sshadeh: its new yeah i think
[2:41:52] ryanc1124: def new
[2:41:53] Strouss: when i did raid numbers comparing DK to Bear, DK had higher heals and accepted more heals from the healer but mitigated less.  Bear imo is better.  But DK has higher dps.
[2:41:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shattered bones was an azerite trait or something
[2:42:34] sshadeh: bonestorm is great healing on AoE
[2:42:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: The heal from bonestorm is surprising
[2:42:52] sshadeh: you can get 15% of your max health healed every second for 10 seconds, with 100 runic power
[2:43:04] sshadeh: if you have at least 5 enemies near you the entire duration
[2:44:00] king_julian_96: imagine the new uldaman on mythic plus though
[2:44:05] Strouss: if your hunter was on the ball and MD every pull to you he can have higher uptime.  normally tanks have higher dps cause of the pulling and uptime.
[2:44:11] king_julian_96: you would have to pumup to time a 15
[2:44:42] Strouss: <3 the big pulls lol
[2:44:47] sshadeh: the vampiric blood AoE talent + boneshields shattering
[2:44:49] sshadeh: :D
[2:44:56] sshadeh: and red thrist reducing VB cooldown
[2:45:02] jetributions: i need 6 more points for huntmaster build
[2:45:06] zgag: Islands   PogChamp PogChamp
[2:45:08] Strouss: Vampiric Blood is my fav for DK.
[2:45:24] sshadeh: i think dancing rune weapon is better for raiding
[2:45:30] Malorash: Malorash subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:45:35] sshadeh: bonestorm and vampiric blood for M+
[2:46:03] strchsr: Red Thirst #1
[2:46:08] sshadeh: bonestorm isnt used cause it competes with purgatory
[2:46:13] sshadeh: but you can get them both now at 70
[2:46:24] strchsr: Bonestorm is good for low keys
[2:46:27] sshadeh: if you want
[2:46:42] luckfore: yuuuuge KKona
[2:46:51] sshadeh: haha

[2:46:57] procyon_mfc: it does
[2:47:00] sshadeh: i almost dont want alpha just because of that
[2:47:02] sshadeh: LUL
[2:47:06] procyon_mfc: and I came back after taking a break for a year
[2:47:11] shalfey4: but that's good. seems that DF gonna be promissing
[2:47:15] luckfore: SL so boring now lol
[2:47:24] jetributions: i went to play outlaw on live and was like where is my shadowstep
[2:47:27] Scoodles91: w45+ per tree
[2:47:30] br3z: 90% of the time there isnt really a choice anyway with current talents
[2:47:31] zgag: Towelliee going to curse it. Once Blizzard gets word that the new talents are fun it will be nerfed to the ground.
[2:47:39] zgag: p
[2:47:48] king_julian_96: speakign of talents do you think we will get the paladin trees next alpha build towelliee
[2:47:50] MarshallOnline: i think SL feels pointless altogether rn
[2:47:51] Manabucho: you only get 31 points no?
[2:48:00] smashwow: yeah but how many of those were taken out of the spell book that you would get by leveling up normally?
[2:48:05] Strouss: Yeah it looks hands down the best
[2:48:05] WSeveryn: @towelliee talent change is one of the reasons I came back to wow after a year break
[2:48:07] SpidercowSD: @Towelliee Any news on the other class updates coming to alpha? Seems weird to be this far in and no other classes updated
[2:48:09] BlewGamingGroup: and all they had to do was steal it from poe
[2:48:11] htomek: nostalgia is for suckers
[2:48:11] Korupcija_: and it's not even done yet
[2:48:12] smashwow: the fair comparison is choice nodes
[2:48:26] Gurrtug: I like the retail ones cuz they are simple
[2:48:31] Youredoneson666: PoE is dogshit
[2:48:32] zgag: POE light
[2:48:33] BenOSC: It's nothing like POE lol
[2:48:39] MarshallOnline: that talent tree is like 1/50th of PoEs lmao
[2:48:39] mrelgaato: Wait for D4 talent tree)
[2:48:40] manmower: poe doesn't even have talents
[2:48:40] schmooplesthesecond: kek
[2:48:41] Fugazi811: he heard someone else say that
[2:48:45] Manabucho: if it was from poe we would have a ton more choices
[2:48:45] OviTheGray: and who did poe steal it from?
[2:48:46] Ximora_and_Capy: LUL poe literally created out of Blizzards shadow
[2:48:47] v2_Rootz: @Youredoneson666 Kappa
[2:48:49] NickLeonhearth: And POE stole from Final Fantasy 10
[2:48:50] Putcride: if anything poe stole from diablo
[2:48:50] Rohen86: "Steal it From POE" new band name!
[2:48:51] king_julian_96: speaking of talents do you think we will get the paladin trees next alpha build towelliee
[2:48:53] zakare232: POE FeelsGoodMan
[2:48:55] mrsuflakis: 1325
[2:48:56] mavericks312: poe is hot dog water
[2:48:59] Eviltuna13: Was going through all the holy priest talents on alpha and live and i can get 90% of the talents on live in DF cohhJam
[2:49:03] Ramzilla92: can all classes take the same points? no? ok its not from PoE xD
[2:49:04] headninja1ncharge: PoE has those classic FF talents
[2:49:05] asmodai4823: POEs was from ffX
[2:49:10] v2_Rootz: nah 10
[2:49:11] Nazz_1138: 10, sphere grid
[2:49:11] NickLeonhearth: nah 10
[2:49:12] headninja1ncharge: FFX
[2:49:12] Shaeli: PoE's tree is shared between all the "classes" tho...
[2:49:13] DrWraithjr: 10 had the massive number of nodes
[2:49:13] Fullmetal491: 10
[2:49:15] shalfey4: But still people are gonna stick to 1-2 patterns of talents imo
[2:49:16] asmodai4823: yes 10
[2:49:18] raye_gaming22: 10 lol 12 i dogo
[2:49:18] Youredoneson666: WoW had talent nodes before PoE was even a game. Chat please
[2:49:20] sshadeh: PoE passive tree is only passives, zero actives
[2:49:20] SpidercowSD: 10
[2:49:22] raye_gaming22: is*
[2:49:22] Aquadriel: poe wouldnt exist without blizzard :)
[2:49:27] PUBGesus1392: which NFL team do you root for again Mr. T?
[2:49:29] sshadeh: the active customization comes from gear
[2:49:32] Nazz_1138: but 10 was just blitz ball
[2:49:40] strchsr: Private tour is solo
[2:49:45] DoubleNova: no 10 was linear no choices
[2:49:51] sshadeh: @Aquadriel they made the diablo 3 that blizzard should have
[2:49:59] DoubleNova: and didnt wow have talent tree on launch?
[2:50:00] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[2:50:04] WSeveryn: @towelliee I hated when they made the talents, so seeing the new talents makes me happy
[2:50:09] headninja1ncharge: You poor thing
[2:50:13] secretidentity64: Towellieee haven't watched your streams in forever thanks for still playing always makes me feel double nostalgic from the old wow days watching you :D!!  hows dragonflight so far!? first time looking at it

[2:51:11] PUBGesus1392: I am buying the volleyball from cast away and bringing it wherever I watch the Jets this year so I can scream WILSON
[2:51:14] BossBeardMan: I believe the last time I watched You T was when you had the Gynecomastia surgery.

[2:53:35] fokeriser: monkaS azerite monkaS
[2:53:36] mizerboy: what nfl do you cheer for @Towelliee
[2:53:40] LearnedSomething: death's advance?
[2:53:42] llNoTToXiCll: it was going up slightly fast but not that fast
[2:54:01] avat707: scaled
[2:54:10] ModestAce: so there are talents you only get after completing a mission?
[2:54:15] strchsr: @Towelliee They are scaled up
[2:54:15] manmower: questing would be faster
[2:54:15] Strouss: They scale i think
[2:54:25] pavepawns: ye
[2:54:27] Korupcija_: chat will increased dmg for BFA happen at lvl 61?
[2:54:29] Valient491: yes
[2:54:44] LearnedSomething: I haven't done an island in over a year I wouldn't know
[2:54:58] LearnedSomething: are they still good for anything?
[2:54:59] nortom2: did they open up the dragon flight zonees again?
[2:55:05] Faerlynn: level 61-62 mobs, weird, would expect it to be 50 level
[2:55:08] Akermay: Is Torghast going to scale, or be a cake walk once 70?
[2:55:20] ChumbaWumba6943: blizz dont give a damn about legacy stuff now
[2:55:21] Siddydiddydo: legion raids are so difficult
[2:55:43] BenOSC: I clear Antorus mythic just fine solo? I thought it was fixed?
[2:55:45] iamspacemanspiff: Since BFA is still going to be the leveling zone not sure it will happen there
[2:55:46] xlbuddha: !tfa
[2:55:46] Moobot: @xlbuddha Tanks For Alpha is a non-profit org to help fill the void for lack of an Evoker Tank spec in Dragonflight. Helping men and women of WoW get faster queues. Our emotional support Bears will help ease the pain of queues for players around the world.
[2:55:47] Horuseternal69: @Sideric really? I'm soloing everything but antorus every week for the mounts no issues
[2:55:55] luckfore: mythic legion raids are still difficult, bellular tried it on a level 67 dracthyr and had a hard time
[2:56:38] zenFX_: legion mythic is a cakewalk apart from  2 bosses
[2:56:45] Theduskflyer: WoD dungeons are even 3-4 hits for bosses
[2:56:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: The EXP bar is going up, but it doesn't seem crazy
[2:56:53] OviTheGray: ion lied... he said averything will be the same after level scaling
[2:57:04] luckfore: hope at level 70 we can 2 shot legion bosses
[2:57:20] Shredmuffn: especially the weird stuff going on in Ny'alotha
[2:57:22] Youredoneson666: ya i think MrGM did it at 60 and he was flying through exp
[2:57:25] symboliic24: seems like you have gotten almost a bar already
[2:57:38] zenFX_: @luckfore you will be able to. every every two expansions raids get turned to legacy
[2:57:43] IDargas: Eonar need a nerf on mythic
[2:57:47] Exoduc: I just want to farm gmod ez, 70 pls
[2:58:15] luckfore: @zenFX_ but its already 2 expansions now and its still hard ^^
[2:58:33] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: would be cool if they made it so you could Q like in FF for old raids, and just plow thru it with ppl
[2:58:36] Rayao: they used to keep legacy dmg at 2 full expansions back
[2:58:43] zenFX_: @luckfore After every two expansions not on the second
[2:58:55] luckfore: @zenFX_ gotcha
[2:59:00] zenFX_: so dragonflight legion will be a cakewalk like WoD raids
[2:59:02] strchsr: I think most of it comes from finishing it
[2:59:04] Youredoneson666: you do, but won't be much
[2:59:06] Strouss: should be exp at the end
[2:59:29] pavepawns: they just spawned
[2:59:36] zenFX_: Dont know how  you can even say legion mythic is hard when you can solo bfa dungeons and some raids
[2:59:37] strchsr: They don't show up until like 5+ minutes in
[2:59:40] formation2252: you do on live.
[2:59:45] pavepawns: its cause ur on normal
[2:59:47] zenFX_: even shadowlands dungeons can be soloed
[2:59:49] luckfore: legion almost 6 years ago.. wtf
[2:59:59] Fimbulforge: yeah they always show up late on normal
[3:00:18] DudeJoeyAwesome: legion kept me sane during my first year in san diego.
[3:00:19] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: I miss legion ngl
[3:00:22] LearnedSomething: I remember being hyped about this feature
[3:00:25] copterskates: gigaweird
[3:00:28] LearnedSomething: they said the AI would have personalities
[3:00:36] rival_xo: no no no, island expeditions again?
[3:00:38] LearnedSomething: and then it was just the one guy auto jumping
[3:00:38] luckfore: the gamescom reveal was 7 years ago yea
[3:00:43] DecayedmiNt: Cata 12 years ago
[3:00:46] Siddydiddydo: I wish they did mroe with islands
[3:00:49] ohnot___her: I remember legion launch it was yesterday, I woke up mad early to level
[3:00:50] Siddydiddydo: It had so much potential
[3:00:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: I always liked the islands, the AI is a cool concept
[3:00:56] ChumbaWumba6943: the mogs from islands never sell in my experience
[3:00:56] strchsr: @Towelliee Especially on RP servers
[3:00:58] Machinecoach: I love islands
[3:00:59] ohnot___her: I watched you start on the EU serves with your Shaman
[3:01:02] zgag: The water walking mounts were the thing to have to start Legion
[3:01:03] adampanerabread: @Towelliee exp caps at level 68, but your best bet for 66-68 is to party sync with a level 60 and they smash islands in a few min while you get about 700-1k exp per kill.
[3:01:05] LearnedSomething: true
[3:01:16] Shenri: @shytam made me LOL
[3:01:16] Araphas: sold plate legs for 18k
[3:01:34] genjosanso: hey guys i just logged to mr @Towelliee  is he playing retail today?
[3:01:34] zarenadt: I wish they would have used the island tech somewhere i the open world, the AI is cool.
[3:01:52] Aquadriel: Islands was a great feature, but people hated it cause they thought they had to endlessly grind azerite there.. which is false. Only top players 'needed' to do that.

[3:01:57] ohnot___her: @genjosanso Im gonna say no
[3:02:04] mountenman: @towelliee that is just proof that islands were a total and complete failure. The fact that they are just money farms is so far from their intended design.
[3:02:19] BubbaChubbs420: would it not be easier to quest on the new dragon island?
[3:02:51] apb89: Some good music ngl
[3:03:06] Affiiance: Affiiance subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 64 months!

[3:03:43] Wcvechten: is tuesday the day we get waking shores this week?
[3:03:46] Zorthul_: what about the mage tower? is still scaling down to 50?
[3:03:50] TheCliffyShow: I had more fun with Islands when I could run off from my team, and solo stuff. Allowed for more exploration.
[3:04:05] Shrenko: that was not even 1% lol
[3:04:09] Snabido: Toy POGGERS
[3:04:12] Sarocus: Next Bellular video: There is no place to level! Has blizz gone TOO far!?

[3:05:35] Aquadriel: Araphas enemy team really fucked things up cause put you on a "timer" so you felt pressure and could not explore and do achievements or what not at your own pace.
[3:05:56] TheVigiliance: "Did blizzard lie about the level cap?!"
[3:05:57] SpidercowSD: @Towelliee   New She-Hulk Trailer looks much better than the first and Wakanda Forever is going to be poggers!

[3:07:22] SunjammerIV: it's star wars, people who like star wars watch those trailers, not the same for eso
[3:07:26] OviTheGray: @weirdfeel u think?
[3:07:27] TheVigiliance: Wish they would do something like the gorehowl smashing a taxi again
[3:07:29] Nachozdood: right thats what im saying if the tailer is good im gonna show my friends and they might show their friends
[3:07:32] SamULJackson: i use the swotor trailers to get my star wars fix since star wars died with disney LUL
[3:07:35] soge131: We don't need to see an expansion trailer, we're playing it anyways peepoHappy

[3:07:54] Kisswani: Starcraft II legacy of the void shits on both these trailers , the game isn't exactly booming
[3:07:57] Mahrquz: @SunjammerIV Well people look at ESO because they know that the trailers are good. I do that, but don't play the game

[3:09:08] Manabucho: i dont get the aoe build of BDK seems like you want both furthest right and furthest left...
[3:09:10] Kisswani: you can only hope to contain it
[3:09:11] SonofHorus82: imagine saying something as fucking stupid as "WoW is ded!" while watching someone play new xpac Alpha...
[3:09:11] geokouts: Shiny Disco Bear!
[3:09:11] zenFX_: @Mahrquz having to make a trailer so good just for people to want to watch just mean the game will be more of a disappointment then you originally thought it would be
[3:09:17] BeezyLo: disco never sleeps and now sico bear will roar

[3:09:40] Syprus1: @OviTheGray lol right on
[3:10:13] Nachozdood: @OviTheGray i like how they basically made another old school stampede for BM
[3:10:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: owl weaving would be more damage
[3:10:36] Strouss: when i get new healers i just heal inbetween pulls sadge
[3:10:39] Gezber: or just dps in cat form while off tanking? probably a pipe dream
[3:10:52] Gezber: right
[3:11:13] Kisswani: Maul Sadge
[3:11:17] OviTheGray: @Nachozdood yeah.. when a bm calls the animals.. it calls ALL the animals :)
[3:11:18] SpeciousArgument: I hope warlocks get a baseline or class tree interrupt ^^
[3:11:21] Nachozdood: why dont they rework Maul?
[3:11:49] SuperHaxx: they have made maul alot better but mangle should still be first ability
[3:11:51] Squats3: Do you even use maul?
[3:11:52] Nachozdood: its like old heroic strike isnt it?
[3:12:00] gold9871: maul is a rage dump only thing
[3:12:13] LeDerpski: They could make it a passive where when you get hit you have a chance to maul for "free damage"
[3:12:22] Siddydiddydo: if maul was just a free ability, off gcd and proc only it wouldnt be bad
[3:12:34] madbombz_fth: sorry for my langauge but maul can piss right off
[3:12:51] Squats3: Which would probably be good if rage generation worked the same as it did back in like... wotlk/cata time
[3:12:57] SuperHaxx: no maul does not work like old heroic strike
[3:13:00] Nachozdood: next thing they need is Lightning paws for bears XD
[3:13:12] Squats3: @SuperHaxx not quite but close enough
[3:13:16] Literae: We are bears, why don’t we have a bite?
[3:13:28] Strouss: Maul can now be talented to 50% dmg reduction every 20 sec now.... that is good no? not sure what the dmg is tho.
[3:13:32] SuperHaxx: heroic strike replaced your auto attack maul hits whenenver you use it how is that close enouigh?
[3:13:34] SuperHaxx: LUL
[3:13:47] asmodai4823: thats just making bear more brain dead
[3:13:55] asmodai4823: bear is braindead enough
[3:14:05] Strouss: Bottom lol
[3:14:09] Nachozdood: @Literae bears dont tend to bite unless its a killing blow they use paws more :P only reason i could see why they have no bite
[3:14:11] Strouss: below all the trinkets
[3:14:16] Kisswani: too small to calculate FeelsBadMan
[3:14:27] Literae: Aye merge Maul and pulverise
[3:14:30] puddypounce: rounding error
[3:14:38] SuperHaxx: with the maul talents you can now get on single target Maul will be top dmg
[3:14:50] tornbraclet: i dont even have maul on my bars on my druid lol
[3:14:52] SamULJackson: when was the last time they changed maul? or has it even ever been changed?
[3:15:02] a_bu: maul replaced with bear hug
[3:15:02] Siddydiddydo: it does feel bad to spend the rage on it
[3:15:05] laito_: there's like one Class design  dev for all classes
[3:15:11] Literae: The only Maul to exist is Darth Maul Kappa
[3:15:12] Siddydiddydo: Wasn't Maul okay back in MoP or something?
[3:15:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Maul is single target, that's the only real issue
[3:15:15] Orczeus: Heal the wounds!
[3:15:19] FatChase: Blizzard, stop trying to make maul happen. It's not gonna happen. KEKW
[3:15:27] Strouss: yeha its lkast row
[3:15:31] Zettabyte: Towel is mauling again ;D
[3:15:38] puddypounce: ursoc's fury as well
[3:15:43] ninetysix: @Towelliee is rafaam in the alpha yet ?
[3:15:44] SamULJackson: someone at blizzard loves that ability way too much
[3:15:55] puddypounce: gives maul an absorb shield
[3:16:08] lestsunite: feels good in rai
[3:16:11] kylinsky: maybe if maul didn't cost so much rage, it could be a filler
[3:16:20] gali5656: bring back classic warrior whirlwind
[3:16:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is nice that this Ursoc's Fury gets the absorb shield from maul, too

[3:16:28] SuperHaxx: maul hits stupidly hard if you have it stacked up with the mangle and if it crits but yes maul costs too much

[3:31:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: They could add a WoW token to Classic Wrath to make GDKP's legit, but there would be more spazzing out
[3:31:11] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee any ideas about what's going to be in next weeks build?
[3:31:28] BiopticPsyrus: How is Alpha looking so far? What I've seen DF looking tasty
[3:31:39] Bandit_IXII: Do we have a rough estimate or any educated guesses for release?
[3:31:39] bgod2500: GDKP's literally made classic swipe to win which is almost exactly the opposite of what people wanted classic originally for

[4:13:33] Cuebic_: @Exxcar why?
[4:13:43] pig604_: treat it as if its violet hold
[4:13:59] Exxcar: Agreed... @Towelliee didn't they say they wanted dungeons to be on the shorter side going forward? Aside from Mega Dungeons
[4:14:11] Shuttlelol: they should cut it in half and only do one half
[4:14:19] Exxcar: @Cuebic_ Because I don't want a M+ with a 45 min+ timer
[4:14:46] strchsr: @Towelliee If you're still doing more I can hop back on in a bit, just got out of the shower and ordered some UberEats because I realized I haven't eaten in a day and a half lol -- thanks prescription medication
[4:14:54] king_waltzy: well if they arent including all dungeons with m+ initially its prob a good thing. its okay to have longer dungeons but m+ encourages them to be short
[4:15:01] mrkenndy: depends on how aspect of turtle works im guessing?
[4:15:01] TheCliffyShow: I only did Maw of Souls once, and thought it was really cool. The cramped corridors might not be good for some mythic+ affixes, though. Or course, I did vote for Grimrail Depot.

[4:20:37] Exoduc: When i went through guardian talent tree it looked like convoke is more arcane dmg focused bear, than tanky. Thoughts?
[4:20:37] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[4:20:37] Lindenir: @OrgusDC yea
[4:20:45] DecayedmiNt: @OrgusDC Yes, but it's bugged on Alpha and requires you to get it via covenant
[4:20:48] OrgusDC: @Lindenir That is so stupid
[4:20:48] llNoTToXiCll: i think Evoker should be a little bit bigger for being humanoid dragons not too big just like a little bit bigger

[4:22:57] TheCliffyShow: I wanna see Warrior trees. Mostly Arms.
[4:22:58] SethLan: morning fellas
[4:23:01] strchsr: @Towelliee I'd imagine the ones that would be last are DH, Warlock and Monk since there's less datamined about them vs Mage/Warrior/Paladin
[4:23:21] SpyCrabbo: i just want legion arcane mage back
[4:23:22] spiceyholo: well at least it's confirmed 2 new classes and 1 dung :D

[4:24:24] theBatwolf: I hate most of the covenant abilities and now they are going to be permanent.
[4:24:36] avat707: @spiceyholo where is that info at?

[4:24:44] JrocThaGreat: i WOULD LOVE HIM ASA MOUNT THO LOL
[4:24:49] JrocThaGreat: Sorry about the caps
[4:24:53] OrgusDC: If they give classes the covenant abilities it should be a choice that all classes can use. but 1 at a time.
[4:24:58] llNoTToXiCll: this would be a cool mount
[4:25:02] strchsr: @theBatwolf Convoke the Spirits was peak class fantasy, no way they could not keep it
[4:25:11] king_waltzy: @FilthyRichRyan they havent but a lot of abilities/passives were datamined
