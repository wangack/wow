[6:08:13] Reedy177: at the end
[6:08:34] mushy_perples: I think you want shiv to be active for any nature damage as much as possible.
[6:08:45] mushy_perples: because shiv increases your nature damage on the target
[6:08:47] Reedy177: so having shiv too late your bleeds are going to start running out too
[6:09:40] jjooosephh: yup run like forest gump

[6:12:53] mushy_perples: envenom won't do much without poisons lol
[6:13:02] mushy_perples: deadly and crippling
[6:13:04] Reedy177: deadly cripple
[6:13:37] mushy_perples: is his first shiv debuff still active for the sepsis?
[6:13:47] mushy_perples: you for sure want shiv to be active for sepsis
[6:14:01] jjooosephh: rogue is basically having poison on ur blades never forget the poison
[6:14:07] mushy_perples: it's nature damage so shiv increases it
[6:14:09] jjooosephh: in wow
[6:14:24] Reedy177: its already late enough in the macro
[6:14:36] mushy_perples: you just want the debuff active and I think it lasts for like 8 seconds or so
[6:14:43] Reedy177: for sepsis that is
[6:14:49] vindixon: You dont need to add Shiv
[6:14:58] vindixon: Its in late enough
[6:15:01] mushy_perples: I thought he had the shiv after the sepsis
[6:15:26] jjooosephh: bleeds is ur poison thats why no gouge
[6:15:27] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[6:15:27] Reedy177: no shiv adds the debuff you wont need it a second time
[6:15:38] Reedy177: no because theyre stunned
[6:15:42] mushy_perples: yeah you want shiv debuff up for sepsis cuz sepsis is all nature damage
[6:15:42] vindixon: Only last 5 seconds
[6:15:52] iunbearable: no shiv LUL
[6:15:53] Mask3d1: It only lasts 8s
[6:15:58] Reedy177: shiv is next to sepsis in the macro already
[6:16:17] jimmystruggs: isnt 10 seconds too low
[6:16:19] jjooosephh: shiver ü•∂
[6:16:26] jimmystruggs: thats too many spells for gcd no?
[6:16:40] mushy_perples: it's just an issue if shiv debuff falls off before the sepsis hits
[6:16:44] Reedy177: its a sequence not gcd
[6:16:47] mushy_perples: I couldn't see
[6:16:59] Mask3d1: Debuff on tartet
[6:17:00] Reedy177: he has shiv right after sepsis itll buff it still

[6:29:04] Mask3d1: You don't use it as a Sin Rogue.
[6:29:07] mushy_perples: it's for subtlety mostly man
[6:29:16] VanishSHRoguE: @Swifty ur dmg is poison based not physical dmg based
[6:29:19] Reedy177: no you dont need shadow dance as assa
[6:29:19] Mask3d1: Shadowdance is Subtlety.
[6:29:21] VanishSHRoguE: poison and bleed*
[6:29:35] Reedy177: thistle tea is better for assa if you wanted to run down to the bottom
[6:29:46] rattlehed: Cut to the chase causes envelop to extend slice and dice
[6:29:56] Mask3d1: @Swifty Stop.  Change to Subtlety if you want to talk about this.
[6:29:58] mushy_perples: yeah but your stealth abilities do no damage as assassination
[6:30:23] Mask3d1: You're comparing apples to oranges bro.
[6:30:25] Reedy177: you dont run snd for the macro at all though

[6:30:43] Reedy177: then go sub
[6:30:45] HeIlraiser_: we lol
[6:30:53] Reedy177: if you want to run ambush and stuff go sub

[6:31:29] Mask3d1: Different SPECS
[6:31:33] Reedy177: no lol assa is bleeds and poison
[6:31:38] warcraftbuddies: Swifty talents dont mean nothing in general, its for your purpose, if you wanna do BGs solo then its good for you, if you wanna push hardcore maybe not, and so forth.
[6:31:41] mushy_perples: it's cheesy xD but you'll do no damage in shadow dance and you're sacrificing a lot of damage I think.
[6:31:48] newkingcody: its 1 min

[6:32:22] Mask3d1: Think outside the box, see what happens.
[6:32:42] Mask3d1: ......
[6:32:46] HeIlraiser_: get a dev on the phone im sure you have the number lol
[6:32:49] VanishSHRoguE: it was never worth it
[6:32:50] fozzyman: LUL
[6:32:53] mushy_perples: yeah it's for sub because they can reduce the cool down of it spending combo points.
[6:32:54] Mask3d1: How about you listen to your community?  :P
[6:33:08] badkarma2030: :)
[6:33:09] mrcow53: @VanishSHRoguE cause sub lacks dmg outside burtsts like assass or ol
[6:33:27] Raxica: does subs get second dance, so then its 8 secs between uses?
