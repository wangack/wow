[0:48:56] thegreyghost32: Ohh I love death rolls lol
[0:48:57] Drazimo: It'll still create a pyramid with those at the top with loads of the servers gold.
[0:49:02] Pixiepantss: BOTSSS

[0:49:19] markja629: continue?
[0:49:29] nemzky: people just need to stop fucking buying gold, thats literally the only reason they exist in SoD
[0:49:29] smithers0351: @Drazimo that's unavoidable, but at least it's not with RMT
[0:49:39] SirHeiska: Issue mostly that banning GDKP seems like Blizzard gave up with bots
[0:49:48] trez_: will not*
[0:49:49] Ceodewd: Guzu Do you remember when you basically trained a ton of bots for BRD?! Remember? Because we do :P
[0:50:00] flowerpew: it's streamers fault fricc
[0:50:03] gio57qke: how different is bot problem on the locked servers?
[0:50:06] SippinSimpSyrup: True
[0:50:08] neruk887: yea swing the mighty ban hammer on them
[0:50:11] SippinSimpSyrup: Perma ban all gold buyers
[0:50:13] flowerpew: streamers are the real problem fricc
[0:50:15] trez_: guzu wants to ban soda
[0:50:15] Vertigo_GB: as soon as it becomes unprofitable they will dissapear
[0:50:15] Drazimo: @smithers0351 True, but to say that it'd be fine is a bit ignorant as people don't actually know and are throwing around statements they've heard. It'll still make it harder for new people not in the pyramid.
[0:50:15] neruk887: instant perma buyers
[0:50:17] Mortin18: Easiest way is to make anti cheat more invasive @Guzu
[0:50:24] Tekgnicality: RMT is good business for blizzard. banning gdkp is simply pandering to wow dads. nothing to do with "whats best for the game"
[0:50:26] trez_: SURE

[0:50:51] nemzky: its so frustrating that even content creators like nixxion dont understand why "why cant a multibillion dollar company cant stop botting" is such a stupid fucking question
[0:50:55] twitchforgotmyaccount: Those bastards. I bet they're only doing this to make the game better!
[0:50:56] trez_: monkaLaugh
[0:50:57] kosmolson: Blizzard could have sent a message to the community by banning Sodapoppin when he got busted. They gave him a slap on the wrist
[0:50:58] jazzifist: kinda sadge warriors are gonna get titans grip tho, what is ur take on it guzu?
[0:51:02] Mico027: Pendering to wow dads? if anything wow dads are more likely to be the gold buyer OMEGALUL
[0:51:04] myst_u: Random idea: You could make up an other currency then gold so you could do some WoW gdkp stuff. In the passt we had DKP systems with guilds... or is this a bad idea?

[0:53:14] Djinx_o: They could just trade "Forum Gold" For GDKP like how some people traded in Diablo 2, then they dont trade any ingame currency
[0:53:16] SirHeiska: @guzu But also making gold more useless isnt that great idea
[0:53:17] buschxz: ofc you can try to cheese it, but not many ppl will risk their accound to do it
[0:53:20] Horfent: The only reason i know of the peacebloom dkp stuff is because of abarny
[0:53:22] Kissifrotz: Just ban all wow players already
[0:53:22] Drazimo: Gold Buyer was in Vanilla, it's just got worse.
[0:53:23] dietaryadvice: people getting banned for trading gold between wotlk and SoD, its fully chaos with this system

[0:53:34] trez_: i buy gold to support hardworking farmers
[0:53:40] Blufootgaming: i buy gold becuase i hate other players and want to see them suffer Evilge

[0:53:47] Kazay1998: @trez_ BASEDCIGAR
[0:53:53] xz6969: I made 1k in phase 1 from gdkps, i got no idea what im gonna do with the gold tho lol

[0:57:22] Colddaylight: Smoked something green i guess
[0:57:23] teddyrosso: This is the 6th runthrough of classic. The minmaxing and prep for each phase of the game is crazy, because everyone knows what is needed for the next phase of the game. It also makes it super easy to flip the AH making need materials way more expensive than they used to be. To make people stop buying gold they have to up the respawn on nodes, as well as increase the droprate on some resources

[0:59:42] kryhuan: and guilds hold you hostage or you lose rank/prio, noting new there :)
[0:59:42] nemzky: really digging deep for those benefits of GDKP huh
[0:59:45] canidius: only works for raids that clear easily
[0:59:45] teddyrosso: @nemzky players feel demotivated to farm mats because the spawnrate is too low and is filled with bots. With more respawns, the price will drop and the players will be able to compete on the farms
[0:59:46] draiopy: well some people would leave if thier loot comes from boss 1!
[0:59:51] Beunhaase: You Can't do that @Guzu Since everyone is flaming that you will be a IRANIAN SCAMMER and YOINK the loot
[0:59:53] sircrumpler: @trez_ mans been held hostage making wow guides for years SAJ
[1:00:01] SippinSimpSyrup: This is why you dont pug and join a guild……

[1:00:09] Djinx_o: You can't fix people, so we need to fix the game I guess LUL
[1:00:25] Blufootgaming: @SippinSimpSyrup as someone who gdkps, guild runs are better. i just wish my guilds stopped dying Sadge
[1:00:25] foolsendit: you guys must be blinking when he does, ive seen him blink 3 times since someone mentioned it lmao
[1:00:30] SippinSimpSyrup: People pretending that there is no solution to people leaving pugs is wild, join a guild…
[1:00:35] Astralix_WoW: or go to greg 2 greg and get some juciy irani cash
[1:00:35] foolsendit: like 5 or 6 blinks now
[1:00:37] Stabbe: I have raided on 11 chars hte last 3 weeks and done every reset and not a single person has ever left a raid in SoD for me.
[1:00:37] gromp_vendor: Bro i cant stop looking at this guys nose, those holes are MASSIVE WTF
[1:00:46] Mortin18: @foolsendit Its edited too lol
[1:00:53] Mico027: Solution: make last boss drop lots of gold for all raid
[1:01:00] nemzky: Yea except gdkps at that point become "buyers only" so its a moot point
[1:01:01] sircrumpler: Right like I like raids! I keep going even when I have full bis for the tier cuz I like to
[1:01:04] flowerpew: @SippinSimpSyrup I have 3 jobs, 6 wives, 12 children I don't have time to join a guild and raid 20 minutes every 3 days Madge
[1:01:18] Blufootgaming: exactly yeah
[1:01:21] maddhatterr: modern gaming: needing incentives to do game content KEKW holy fuck we are doomed

[1:01:52] gio57qke: people raid until bis gear, then pvp
[1:01:52] sircrumpler: I think people like that are playing WoW for the completely wrong ways to be honest
[1:01:53] Bewts: Nothing will stop RMT unless everything is BoP personal loot.
[1:01:53] Ceodewd: It was a demon raid tho
[1:01:56] Kurama__95: Loot acquired, !vanish
[1:01:57] Mico027: thats why raiding with a guild is bis
[1:01:59] kri_kurilala: Just masterloot everything and roll it out at the end?^^
[1:02:01] mccan2110: happend yesterday in bfd
[1:02:06] Kissifrotz: I do it all the time
[1:02:10] neruk887: you mean ppl dont raid directly after they got shadowmourne ? monsters!!!!
[1:02:24] geennaamnl1: Same happend to me yesterday in DM runs ( non gdkp ) rogue won cloak and chest he could do 1 more . We reset dungeon he just goes afk and never comes back LUL
[1:02:24] Blufootgaming: yeah but then you make more gold
[1:02:28] specialkidmiles: they all buy gold OMEGALUL
[1:02:29] havnelone: But atleast they know how to play mostly
[1:02:30] Blufootgaming: thats the point
[1:02:30] Beunhaase: But that means you get Quicker gold so you get Gear just as fast...
[1:02:34] Trexbo_: iAsk Maybe it's a controversial take, but I feel like Blizzard should have a better reporting system to report toxic players like that. Sort of like in League of Legends, if you leave a game and get reported you're likely to get banned right?
[1:02:36] nemzky: what if they made GDKPs based off of a fake currency like a point system, this "dungeon killing point" system would be awarded based on people doing well and helping the guild outside of the raid, and spent on items like gold! What a great idea YEP
[1:02:46] mlady_telegramz97: @trexbo_ TRUE
[1:02:51] Zecxx: @kri_kurilala only partly resolves the issue, if ppl need a single item they still leave if it doesnt drop
[1:03:01] gio57qke: ye should be, but some just want the money
[1:03:01] Trexbo_: Yeah the reporting system is os bad
[1:03:02] SirHeiska: @guzu If your Ruby sanctum raid would been GDKP, you would have cleared it in 30mins.
[1:03:07] Trexbo_: It's like "Bad name" or "cheating"
[1:03:09] sircrumpler: @trexbo_ they'd have to hire more people KEKL
[1:03:11] Ceodewd: Ban someone for leaving a raid? No way, that would be overkill
[1:03:12] flowerpew: @Trexbo_ every dad gamer would be up in arms, what if their grandma crawls up on the roof and they can't stay for 15 mins Madge
[1:03:17] callexy95: think bigger problem is gold buyers in the gdkp, u cant rly outbid gold buyers
[1:03:19] draiopy: @Trexbo_ but banning people on free to play game vs paid game not the same ....

[1:06:01] nemzky: What a dumb take, "there always has to be a gear/monitary reward" is why people started playing classic over retail
[1:06:01] OlympicUSA: it’s my participation trophy and I need it now
[1:06:03] MeleePiper: for none gold buyer, gdkp = 0% of character progression
[1:06:07] Grissu_: negatives are bigger than positives. I hate gdkp, I would rather raiding with epgp
[1:06:10] sad0____: GDKP is fine, the problem is RMT
[1:06:10] kri_kurilala: it's fun. If you're not having fun without loot you shouldnt play the game at all^^
[1:06:10] SippinSimpSyrup: THEN DONT RAID
[1:06:12] Horfent: Find a good raid guild, have fun with them, get loot at some point!
[1:06:13] Mico027: soft skinned wow player who cant handle not getting something all the time Classic
[1:06:17] Smasher16323: if the lockout is 3 days, then GDKP doesn't matter too much
[1:06:17] Avviato: if so, why do not you keep on raiding WOTLK?
[1:06:17] RushedFuq: i miss the times when ppl were happy for other when something dope dropped nowadays its haters only
[1:06:19] Notroland: SR sucks when shit people SR doesn’t drop they leave.
[1:06:20] TrueNosus: i like raiding with my guildies they are fun to be in VC with
[1:06:24] LeeshDK: What if you got a small gold drop every time you didn't roll or didn't win a roll?
[1:06:27] trez_: fun Misery
[1:06:28] Blufootgaming: @nemzky ??? gdkps are more popular here than ever in retail om
[1:06:28] Qiima1: i did 16 lock outs whit no gear drops on my feral on bfd that wasnt funny
[1:06:28] eddiieo: WHAT
[1:06:29] MeowgicTheCathering: NOWAYING fun
[1:06:30] alextheblight: FUN????
[1:06:30] Drazimo: Rewards feel better when you've been waiting.
[1:06:30] CeX360: WHAT
[1:06:30] Typonaa: NOWAY
[1:06:31] zebrakissen: om fun
[1:06:32] AlphaOmegaOW: 200-400 try's on the same boss, without getting any shit is the real fun !
[1:06:32] ondying93: WHAT
[1:06:32] SippinSimpSyrup: Lmaooo no
[1:06:34] Kurama__95: D:
[1:06:34] Floh_XD: @guzu the worst thing of gdkp is the leader cut
[1:06:34] VinnyPezz: rewards = fun though
[1:06:34] ondying93: WOWOWOWOWO
[1:06:35] flow1sm: NOWAYING
[1:06:35] Nicrot: DansGame
[1:06:36] Horfent: Hot takes
[1:06:36] Blademp: Nonono, that cant be the solution
[1:06:36] ondying93: NOWAY
[1:06:36] 3Brick_: NOWAY WHAT IS FUN?
[1:06:37] eddiieo: NOWAY
[1:06:37] neruk887: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT NOOOOOOOOOO WAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY
[1:06:37] smithers0351: NOWAY
[1:06:37] dietaryadvice: weirdPaper too far guzu
[1:06:39] nTOico_: which item is fun?
[1:06:39] prodigy_wow: @SippinSimpSyrup exactly what the video is saying, they dont raid once the gear isnt there or impossible to get
[1:06:40] arobba: i like playing the game with my friends
[1:06:40] smithers0351: NOWAYING
[1:06:40] iTsUndrew: imagine always getting loot
[1:06:42] Lolann: Have fun, lol
[1:06:46] SippinSimpSyrup: Yeah crazy take right?
[1:06:49] smithers0351: yapping
[1:06:49] specialkidmiles: that's just sick Guzu
[1:06:52] DrMaggz: What is this filthy casual take!? DansGame
[1:06:56] smithers0351: fricc this guy
[1:06:56] geennaamnl1: I need to get the best gear possible or otherwise you refuse to take me again to ur bfd raid :(
[1:06:58] MeowgicTheCathering: theres a good video about how gaming has changed that relates to this
[1:07:03] AlternateProject: Or maybe take a break and do something else, don't spam the dungeon for 100 times
[1:07:04] neuroxin: this man sounds like he is reading a prepared statement while gold sellers hold him at gun point off camera
[1:07:04] genosse_moomin: Titanforging coming in P3 Pog
[1:07:11] Blufootgaming: @MeowgicTheCathering the folding ideas one?
[1:07:12] neruk887: I need to be the very best, like no one ever was!!!!!
[1:07:12] VinnyPezz: But what if they remove gold and turn it into LOOTTokens.
[1:07:15] flumiscent: i only have fun when hunters get nerfed
[1:07:16] VinnyPezz: hmm
[1:07:18] Sckarr1337: if you ain't buying gold, your gold is meaningless   LOL
[1:07:25] nemzky: @Blufootgaming maybe i worded it weird I mean in retail its expected to ALWAYS get a reward. Every aspect of the game you do for rewards, classic thats not the case. You do things just because its fun
[1:07:26] SirHeiska: Maybe have GDKP server
[1:07:30] mccan2110: 2 x GDKP servers , 1 x PvE server kek
[1:07:31] Grissu_: if there was no way to buy gold then yes, gdkp would be good
[1:07:33] Djinx_o: If it's Forum Gold it's transferable too, for all who have an account on the forum
[1:07:39] Mr_Moffert: ive been doing it with the same grp all phase
[1:07:39] smithers0351: yapping
[1:07:43] mlady_telegramz97: yapping
[1:07:43] Drazimo: It's a 'I want it now' mentality.
[1:07:47] CamGG__: irl lockout om
[1:07:51] specialkidmiles: Cryge
[1:07:55] Critties92: Just get xd
[1:07:56] Bewts: Remove everything because I'm too worried about what other people are doing
[1:07:56] mordiell: JUST
[1:07:59] mordiell: JUST
[1:08:00] smithers0351: this idiot
[1:08:01] Numline123: frens Saj
[1:08:01] Valestrus: stupid question perhaps: why is he wearing a fireman helmet ?
[1:08:03] Horfent: calling a week for lockout godamn it man
[1:08:03] Beunhaase: PUG = JUST GET SAME PEOPLE ICANT
[1:08:03] mordiell: streamer take
[1:08:03] groyped: ive pugged every bfd on 3 characters each reset its fine
[1:08:04] NutriaFury: and you can call that a guild.....
[1:08:04] Delxenyo: Problem about non GDKP stuff is that you cant sell on G2G afterwards
[1:08:05] Mr_Moffert: @mordiell its not that hard
[1:08:06] Kmarticus: I think it encourages people to make friends and join a guild with people who have a similar time schedule
[1:08:08] Nicrot: 4Head just
[1:08:08] nemzky: @Blufootgaming At least thats how it was in classic when it launched KEKW
[1:08:08] Blufootgaming: "just get your audience to play whenever youre on"
[1:08:08] SirHeiska: Just get wife and kids
[1:08:08] Jellooze: its a i want a guild but i dont want to guild
[1:08:08] Boneyards_666: like mordiell YEP
[1:08:09] mccan2110: that never works
[1:08:09] Trexbo_: Sadge I dont have friends
[1:08:10] StreamElements: Subscribe to the new Youtube for MORE Content!: https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2 !
[1:08:10] Destruckt: Just do it :)
[1:08:12] mlady_telegramz97: streamer take
[1:08:12] Unimatrix010: 4HEad and also just get a gf while youre at it
[1:08:14] Djinx_o: Only half the people can that day
[1:08:17] 1337kunedo: GDKP are bad. Simple as that
[1:08:19] Jalapinot: Just communicate with your guild, YEP
[1:08:20] LeeshDK: 3 day lockout is maddening. Wish it was 2 set reset days per week :0
[1:08:21] jayrarmensouaf: Bots are wow cancer and GDKP is cancer for the wow economy
[1:08:22] Stabbe: Get a freakin guild guys xD Solves all the gearing problem
[1:08:23] sircrumpler: I never found a problem with this, I'm social and would build large friend lists on my sever
[1:08:24] draiopy: @Valestrus because tis topic is gonna start alot of fight and fire throwing!!
[1:08:24] zebrakissen: talkin is a foreign concept to wow players
[1:08:25] Blufootgaming: YEP
[1:08:25] Trexbo_: Although this is why I like Quota YEP
[1:08:30] piperboi: YEP
[1:08:32] Unimatrix010: maybe Hmm
[1:08:32] mlady_telegramz97: YEP
[1:08:33] mccan2110: i neever seen same player altho i raid every reset same hour
[1:08:35] heartheater3: i dont get how people are struggling to get gear and ifnd groups to the point they need to gdkp
[1:08:35] Beunhaase: NOPE
[1:08:35] specialkidmiles: ALOO HeadShot794 peepoHug
[1:08:37] driftrockz: yes
[1:08:37] kosmolson: no
[1:08:38] Jalapinot: People say "just" for communicating with their guild/friends? What?
[1:08:39] arobba: yep
[1:08:39] CamGG__: nah as a casual I was able to pug any day I logged on with guild.
[1:08:40] bassiemon123: The dude really loved his gdkp. He made a shit ton of gold. Just being a karen rn
[1:08:41] mlady_telegramz97: NO?
[1:08:42] callexy95: i am with 9 other friends
[1:08:42] SirHeiska: No.
[1:08:42] Trexbo_: Quota allows you to form groups YEP
[1:08:42] HeadShot794: HUGGIES @specialkidmiles CHEER
[1:08:44] Valestrus: @draiopy haha love it!
[1:08:44] canidius: no
[1:08:45] Kleinholz1988: just see the good that you only need 10 people for that raid .. and not 20 like for ZG an aq20
[1:08:45] sircrumpler: Like you can find 15-20 ppl who you can whisper even if you're not in the same guild to befriend
[1:08:45] Blufootgaming: no?
[1:08:46] Mr_Moffert: i think its reasoable take, ive been doing every BFD with the same core 6 people
[1:08:47] Mico027: Yep, but guild too small for all my alts
[1:08:47] neruk887: -
[1:08:47] pwnage4me4free: for me its like that
[1:08:48] driftrockz: thats how it works
[1:08:49] teddyrosso: 11 guild runs each reset
[1:08:49] VinnyPezz: Lads social interraction seems scary but making friends is done via this exact thing. Just ask anyone and see how it goes.
[1:08:50] nodnarB_: @heartheater3 u dont understand how they lose rolls? its rng
[1:08:54] canidius: people aren’t loyal to any raid
[1:08:54] Raph115: yeah thats how my guild does it
[1:08:55] gio57qke: it works until people are bis gear and stop playing
[1:08:56] 3Brick_: @Guzu No i have never done guild raids only guild runs i have done is with you
[1:08:56] nemzky: Yes, my guild has a collaboration between multiple raids and we run 3-4 runs every reset @Guzu
[1:08:57] mordiell: raids turn to drama and people leave
[1:09:02] Delxenyo: Let me come into every raid with 500 euros that I spent just to get the trinket that a guy that farms gold for months and attends raids LOL
[1:09:02] TrueNosus: id call my guildies friends
[1:09:03] stompiwompie: Depends on how big your guild is
[1:09:05] 3Brick_: @Guzu No i have never done guild raids only guild runs i have done is with you 󠀀
[1:09:08] SirHeiska: We dont even talk outside of raids
[1:09:09] MeowgicTheCathering: @Blufootgaming by dagger, its this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wySogtfJ7B4
[1:09:09] sircrumpler: Ok it might not be the same 10, but you can get a malleable list of people
[1:09:10] arobba: i play with my friends
[1:09:11] bassiemon123: Amen
[1:09:12] specialkidmiles: guzuDespair socializing
[1:09:14] ralphmouse85: Eww social interactions
[1:09:16] XezNinety: Yeah lol, people are just angry so aren't approaching the subject logically. There is more pros than cons in banning GDKP
[1:09:18] 77_Spectre_77: thats life
[1:09:19] VinnyPezz: WoW has been drama since 2004
[1:09:19] Valestrus: hi @mordiell :D
[1:09:22] Mr_Moffert: if people start drama, dont invite that guy again
[1:09:23] Jalapinot: Very true
[1:09:23] flowerpew: guzu's halion attempt people left every pull ICANT
[1:09:25] Boneyards_666: whos billy
[1:09:26] Ari0n0s: awaree Talking to people
[1:09:27] bassiemon123: If there is no drama its not a mmorpg
[1:09:27] alextheblight: billy is always causing drama
[1:09:27] Trexbo_: And Billy bought gold om
[1:09:27] specialkidmiles: Madge Billy
[1:09:28] twitchforgotmyaccount: Fucking Kevin
[1:09:29] Boneyards_666: why is he so rich
[1:09:30] sircrumpler: Kevin's just a bitch
[1:09:31] mordiell: @Valestrus oh hello widepeepoHappy
[1:09:31] piperboi: Well i did both qouta raids and Pugs both good but 2 raids were full demon 1 raid didnt even kill jorgus LUL
[1:09:32] breenlol: kevin is always pissed
[1:09:32] Yvernaa: Dramaaaaaa
[1:09:32] geennaamnl1: Bruh what ur saying , I never got pissed about loot
[1:09:34] Yvernaa: Best content
[1:09:34] Burritosalad: kevin always gets pissed :(
[1:09:34] maddhatterr: drama over pixels KEKW
[1:09:37] twitchforgotmyaccount: I've had it with these Billy apologists
[1:09:40] Jellooze: @1337kunedo i dont think its that simple, there are good things about GDKP but the overall consensus is that is bad for the game
[1:09:40] Trexbo_: So Kevin is pissed because he is ethical
[1:09:42] Vertigo_GB: Thats probably why retail tried personal loot
[1:09:43] Cobington: loot > guild > server that's how it works
[1:09:43] Horfent: if raids turn into drama all the time find a proper guild not just join the first cesspool guild you find in chat
[1:09:44] ma_de__: For real gold is worth nothing in this game :D So how is there progress after a gdkp. Ppl buying thousands of gold
[1:09:45] Ticklezao: and "girls" in guild NODDERS
[1:09:46] 3Brick_: @Guzu No i have never done guild raids only guild runs i have done is with you when you are bringing me in to blue ball me on the staff
[1:09:49] sircrumpler: You're so right tho and I'm not a streamer @guzu
[1:09:50] shlyq1: remove loot ingame, all problems solved
[1:09:52] trez_: YEP
[1:09:53] Avviato: no loot drama in gdkp. want item bid more. can't bid go farm
[1:09:54] regularpers: kinda
[1:09:54] skario: yeah
[1:09:55] piperboi: YEP
[1:09:55] nemzky: the fact that so many people say "no ive never been in a guild" just highlights how awful the social state of SoD is right now
[1:09:55] VinnyPezz: it wouldnt be drama if loot in classic was personal loot. but that would ruin the classic experience.
[1:09:56] msmester1: nah
[1:09:56] Shtouf: No
[1:09:56] schmandlunge420: yes
[1:09:57] SirHeiska: Odly yes
[1:09:57] Salond_AUT: ez....so many random raids
[1:09:57] geennaamnl1: Why are you saying I get pissed about loot ? Im sadge
[1:09:57] spardel_: NO is eazy
[1:09:57] Jalapinot: No, thats not hard
[1:09:58] Mico027: Its not hard, people are fuckin lazy
[1:09:59] bassiemon123: I got 3 characters bis, Just by pugs. No its ez
[1:09:59] Trexbo_: Tbf it kinda is YEP
[1:10:01] sircrumpler: You can make friends guys!!!!
[1:10:01] driftrockz: no its super easy
[1:10:01] specialkidmiles: no gfs allowed YEP
[1:10:05] Mr_Moffert: but i work 3jobs have 8wives etc
[1:10:08] Joxtirol: i just do pug it easy
[1:10:11] 3Brick_: I am a solo player i dont have friends who play WoW Classic
[1:10:15] Shtouf: You just need to talk with other pple
[1:10:15] tropengold_: no but needs good coordination
[1:10:16] Blufootgaming: @MeowgicTheCathering saving for later. if you wanna see a similar concept but just about wow try this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKP1I7IocYU
[1:10:18] mlady_telegramz97: just pug it Hmmge
[1:10:19] Baharack: always hard to swap raid days with 3 day lockout. ppl are doing other things than wow
[1:10:22] Destruckt: use discord bots to make signups, whoever signs up gets to go that reset
[1:10:27] shifti_CH: i still haven't seen bfd from the inside
[1:10:28] Arcsilin: so many ppl playing pugs are easy
[1:10:29] kisaness: Not realy. You have to commit but beside that it's pretty easy to find a core group.
[1:10:30] CamGG__: you dont have to raid in the first hour of the first day. every lockout you have 3 days to find a time that works for the group.
[1:10:32] prodigy_wow: It depends on the class, but chasing after the BFD staff is a waste of time
[1:10:32] driftrockz: just find a decent guild its not that hard
[1:10:32] Vertigo_GB: Thats why I prefer smaller raids. anything more than 25 is not fun for me personally
[1:10:34] Bewts: WoW community thinking they're going to defeat RMT without making everything BoP ICANT
[1:10:36] msmester1: Become a streamer NOTED
[1:10:36] Qiima1: thtas exactly how we did it on p1 started with pug grp and started raiding together we was 6 players and we pug last 4
[1:10:40] StreamElements: Sub to the IRL channel NOW! Madge https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2
[1:10:43] spardel_: started playing in sod. dont know any1. and ive been doing BFD with the same 8 people. @Guzu
[1:10:43] VinnyPezz: @Guzu what would u think of this: Raids give personal loot so GDKP's are not needed anymore?
[1:10:44] geennaamnl1: Guzu I want you to apologies now to me , you are spreading lies . Me kevin has never been mad about loot , take those words back @Guzu
[1:10:45] kri_kurilala: GDKP also locks out new players who don't have gold. How are you supposed to gear up if you're like 10 weeks late to the p1 raid
[1:10:47] xz6969: make your own SR groups and don't invite anyone that needs what u need xd
[1:10:47] poopooindiaper: Good afternoon @Guzu & chat. Was feeling tired a few hours back so i took a nap and i'm no longer tired.
[1:10:48] Djinx_o: I play with a group of 10 friends, but we usually have to pug 6-7 players cause we can't find time
[1:10:49] Boneyards_666: yep
[1:10:49] ma_de__: 20g from gdkp is worth nothing when ppl buy 1000
[1:10:50] Kmarticus: I think its a problem Blizzard created. Over the years giving players more and more incentive to play alone, and now people don't want to be a part of a guild or community. I personally also feel it makes individuals more selfish about loot.
[1:10:51] Trexbo_: It was giga hard in the first weeks when people were still struggling with mechanics and consums YEP
[1:10:52] Valestrus: @Guzu  - i use DKP in my raids
[1:10:54] Valestrus: DKP is good
[1:10:55] SippinSimpSyrup: This is a social game, im sorry it doesnt work for solo players, but raiding wanst designed for solo players, its that simple
[1:10:56] mlady_telegramz97: Yes
[1:10:57] Boneyards_666: thats why i stopped playing them XDD
[1:10:58] arobba: his take only works if you're solo, i like seeing my friends and guildies get gear even if i get nothing
[1:11:00] mordiell: and thats the problem , exactly
[1:11:01] trez_: Nerdge  second life is a different game
[1:11:03] callexy95: FUCK PERSONAL LOOT
[1:11:05] mordiell: people dont want to spend that time
[1:11:06] SirHeiska: Time isnt the issue. Other people are.
[1:11:07] Jalapinot: MMOs have a lot of people. Find some to be friendly with. Game is easy
[1:11:09] msmester1: NO PERSONAL LOOT
[1:11:12] Dinomight3: personal loot sucks
[1:11:17] VinnyPezz: Whats the issue with personal loot?
[1:11:17] KyoouN: If you have a big issue with it you can do a SR run. While it can still go bad (why would the random reserve something that you don't need anymore) but it's still better than MS>OS
[1:11:21] mordiell: i agree
[1:11:23] ERNST54: dont make it like retail
[1:11:24] Drazimo: I want it now!
[1:11:25] branz_bs: in my expirience GDKP is best loot sistem, i all thru years and gdkp feels the best..and ive never bought gold...althou it would be better if ppl didnt buy gold
[1:11:30] buschxz: back to mobile games than
[1:11:30] smithers0351: just dont play SADGE
[1:11:30] SippinSimpSyrup: Personal loot would be the death knell of classic
[1:11:32] Valestrus: good attendance should = loot to some extent imo
[1:11:34] sircrumpler: SO TRUE
[1:11:34] MeowgicTheCathering: @MeowgicTheCathering oh i think ive come across that vid too, will watch it later Okayge
[1:11:37] Blufootgaming: @VinnyPezz angry boomers blame anything they dont like for ruining the game
[1:11:39] 3Brick_: @Guzu i am a solo player and have been for a long time and it is pain to find groups sometimes as a DPS mage, this is why i rerolled healer in Wrath since noone wants me even if i do good or not
[1:11:40] mlady_telegramz97: people just care about themselves and getting everything for themselves
[1:11:41] Trexbo_: YEP They want LFR
[1:11:43] mlady_telegramz97: EXACTLY
[1:11:44] Smasher16323: RAID FINDER LETS GO
[1:11:45] msmester1: play an another game then om
[1:11:45] mccan2110: there is no rpg in wow ^^
[1:11:46] Joxtirol: i dont get it why people dont like personal loot
[1:11:46] smithers0351: if you don't like the RPG play retail
[1:11:46] Shtouf: There is retail for that kind of gaming
[1:11:49] Dinomight3: then they can play retail
[1:11:51] pwnage4me4free: nah i like the rpg element
[1:11:54] Trexbo_: YEP They want LFR but HATE LFR BECAUSE IT'S RETAIL OM
[1:11:55] nemzky: Kappa
[1:11:55] VinnyPezz: No i just really wanna know why people wont want personal loot i dont fully understand it
[1:11:58] Valestrus: DKP > GDKP
[1:12:00] MeowgicTheCathering: wow is a lobby game now Aware
[1:12:01] o_0shak0_o: Buggest lootdrama: naaaah Warrior taking all the leather Gear!
[1:12:02] Beggebin: They dont even wanna raid. They just wanna GAMBA on the gear drops and get that dopamine
[1:12:03] flowerpew: @Trexbo_ real ICANT
[1:12:04] MonsieurTog: Make them stop Guzu Madge
[1:12:04] Jalapinot: Retail is over there for people who hate RPGs 👉
[1:12:09] Destruckt: its all about whos got the biggiest dong nowaday's most rp is gone
[1:12:10] Grissu_: then should be an option for personal loot choosen by group leader
[1:12:15] sircrumpler: I don't either
[1:12:16] dietaryadvice: D:
[1:12:18] Beunhaase: Feelsweird to punish GDKP's because of gold buyers... Just ban the gold buyers / seller ICANT
[1:12:21] KillTouch: Its only way casuals can keep up with streamers that get everything handed to them .
[1:12:23] mordiell: thats the core problem, people dont want to spend time to play an mmo as they should, but they wanna still play it
[1:12:23] spardel_: DET ER SÅ NEMT
[1:12:26] VinnyPezz: Yeah they should atleast make the option to make it a personal loot instance?
[1:12:29] mordiell: thats why all these things happen
[1:12:29] Yvernaa: SR is fine but most players in those runs are so bad guzuY
[1:12:30] Horfent: because there is rpg in classic wow
[1:12:30] genosse_moomin: Peacebloom DKP >>> all
[1:12:30] VinnyPezz: that'd fix alot no?
[1:12:31] Cobington: the game is no longer about rpg its all just numbers and parsing. its a solved game so nobody wants to bother pretending to reinvent the wheel.
[1:12:32] Trexbo_: Honestly, getting back into WoW has made me HATE WoW players so much om
[1:12:32] nemzky: I play retail for the instant gratification for content, and classic for the social and true MMO experience
[1:12:36] Joxtirol: sr raids is best one
[1:12:42] VinnyPezz: Trexbo_ yeah no shit.. :P
[1:12:48] SpaceCowboy0811: GDKP was good 10 years ago.
[1:12:53] flowerpew: Trexbo_ me too? Cryge
[1:12:57] flumiscent: so, if wow is so time consuming, we can just ban 7 child dads with 2 works who are crying about everything in the game, and just have some nice time there
[1:13:10] StreamElements: FULL game playthroughs of variety games and entire vods can be found here! https://www.youtube.com/@guzuvods196
[1:13:12] branz_bs: but u can get gold now thru AH and wow token
[1:13:19] Trexbo_: @flowerpew Depends if you talk shit about Denmark Stare
[1:13:20] ratistic: You are not really making "progress" in gdkp, you just spread the value if your loot over all un the raids, like any dkp
[1:13:21] msmester1: this video has no point once you know it we talked about this exact thing soooo much arleady....
[1:13:22] flowerpew: DOYOUHAVEGAMESONYOURPHONE LiveReaction
[1:13:23] VinnyPezz: Instead of excluding people who dont have that time give them options
[1:13:26] sircrumpler: Him describing it as parasitic is super important tbh
[1:13:26] VinnyPezz: give everyone options
[1:13:28] Dinomight3: @flumiscent bad take
[1:13:29] flowerpew: @flowerpew peepoDenmark

[1:13:36] mlady_telegramz97: EXACT
[1:13:41] Typonaa: NODDERS
[1:13:48] Blufootgaming: gdkp would still thrive if rmt didnt exist, pots are smaller but demand is smaller
[1:13:49] VinnyPezz: its honest work
[1:13:51] VinnyPezz: it aint much
[1:13:51] piperboi: what has this dude been smoking?
[1:13:54] FueledGames: yes def a parasitic relationship
[1:13:57] KillTouch: @Guzu only way casuals can keep up with streamers is to do gdkps, but we have to agree booster buyers are mainly buying gold  at the prices they are too.
[1:13:58] Trexbo_: @flowerpew JK I actually think a lot of people in here are what I WANTED from WoW players, it's just the average WoW player is so dissappointing yapping
[1:14:04] nzcorona: goddamn are ppl still arguing about this
[1:14:08] somadaz: $$$
[1:14:08] trez_: i just love mc monkaLaugh

[1:14:12] Mr_Moffert: aaaa I LOVE MC
[1:14:13] MeowgicTheCathering: prefox monkaLaugh
[1:14:13] VinnyPezz: Trexbo_ are you against personal loot ?
[1:14:15] love_and_kitties: trying to join a gdkp  is also  like  trying to  do taxes
[1:14:16] Tekgnicality: WoW game design is outdated, especially how we earn gold. i dont want to pick peacebloom in order to buy consumes for raid.
[1:14:16] SippinSimpSyrup: So much cope from gdkpers
[1:14:19] Jalapinot: KEKW 💨
[1:14:22] nemzky: I watched one of Ahmpys streams a few weeks ago and a warlock bought EVERY item, for him and his rogue friend for hundreds of gold per item. And people think tahts healthy for the game?
[1:14:22] mlady_telegramz97: aaaa MOLTEN CORE IS GOOD
[1:14:27] SirHeiska: O think he means the system does not require bought gold. Its just beneficial.
[1:14:32] shifti_CH: ban streamers
[1:14:34] maffin1214: when someone buys gold it doesnt increase the total gold ammount on a server, its because bots are farming for gold, no? wouldnt it just fix the issue to ban bots?
[1:14:38] Trexbo_: @VinnyPezz Shruge Not really
[1:14:39] sircrumpler: I know this is crazy, but I do wonder what would happen if they made ONE server that allowed RMT.the stories of item prices in cash value would be insane
[1:14:41] branz_bs: i do gdkps always and im always poor cuz i gamba :(
[1:14:43] batu_x96: I watched one of Ahmpys streams a few weeks ago and a warlock bought EVERY item, for him and his rogue friend for hundreds of gold per item. And people think tahts healthy for the game?

[1:15:09] agorohunter: kapp
[1:15:12] VinnyPezz: Trexbo_ hmm im not against it either, Infact i believe it would fix most of the gdkp problems. but alot of people say they dont want it but dont give any explanation on why they dont want it.
[1:15:13] PaddiV: @Guzu would the problem not be solved if Blizzard would solve the economy problem? like.. if there would be vendor who would sell flasks for 1G each.
[1:15:14] zebrakissen: 350k thoridal YEP
[1:15:14] Blufootgaming: ITS ALMOST LIKE THATS HOW IT WORKS
[1:15:15] kri_kurilala: thats called money laundering
[1:15:16] maffin1214: when someone buys gold it doesnt increase the total gold ammount on a server, its because bots are farming for gold, no? wouldnt it just fix the issue to ban bots?
[1:15:20] Yvernaa: quantWeird

[1:15:22] batu_x96: i have only 70k in wotlk :/
[1:15:22] Burritosalad: Sure
[1:15:23] Baharack: it engages well equipped chars to participate in raids
[1:15:23] Cobington: viewers bought gold -> gift to you, goldbuying by proxy
[1:15:23] Hycubis: You were basically getting the bought gold second hand
[1:15:25] johahs95: The problem with simons take is that he doesnt understand that a large portion of the pot hes earned through GDKPs are from  gold buyers.
[1:15:27] SirHeiska: Yeah.. you are still basically washing dirty gold
[1:15:28] KazTheGiantslayer: KazTheGiantslayer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Oh wow, 2 years huh? I don't know what to write now. At least i can thank you for the last 2 years they have been amazing and helped me out alot. Keep up the amazing work Guzu, never change :)
[1:15:28] StreamElements: KazTheGiantslayer just subscribed for 24 months in a row PogChamp
[1:15:29] Jellooze: streamers shouldnt compare their gameplay with "normal" players.
[1:15:29] Altijdmiss: Maybe you got gold ingame from people that buy gold YEP
[1:15:29] tamirerez1: they took you because u are a streamer
[1:15:30] Kazay1998: those sunwells were insane
[1:15:32] Trexbo_: The problem is, you dont NEED to buy gold with GDKP because the others in the GDKP probably HAVE bought gold, so you're essentially getting it through proxy
[1:15:32] Mico027: Dirty gold
[1:15:33] Trexbo_: YEP
[1:15:35] Karpaa: comon how mutch was from viewer trades from buying
[1:15:38] Altijdmiss: streamer bennies
[1:15:41] batu_x96: they took you because u are a streamer
[1:15:45] trez_: got that much gold through the trade window xD
[1:15:50] Rolzar: morning Guzu and chat!
[1:15:51] nemzky: Yea now tell me how its possible to gear a new character in a situation where people are dropping hundreds of thousands of gold for items? LULW @Guzu
[1:15:54] SippinSimpSyrup: 99% pf every gdkp has gold buyers in them
[1:15:55] theonlyxice: I wonder how the big spenders got all their gold though?
[1:15:55] mlady_telegramz97: aww widepeepoHappy
[1:15:56] trez_: COPIUM
[1:15:56] Ticklezao: COPIUM

[1:15:58] MeowgicTheCathering: SURE
[1:15:58] sircrumpler: Strimmer
[1:16:00] Boneyards_666: streamer bennies
[1:16:14] Trexbo_: @VinnyPezz Yeah I agree, I think it would fix some issues, but I'm sure people have counter arguments that I'm just not aware of YEP
[1:16:14] mlady_telegramz97: @branz_bs oh yeah about that.. PepeLaugh
[1:16:18] XezNinety: Damn Guzu the Influencer!
[1:16:19] macradarkstar: Streamers bring bought gold to gdkps. NODDERS
[1:16:21] Seoken1: streamer brain is like hungry hungry hippo, eat it all
[1:16:22] Delxenyo: GDKPs emporwered bots, people bought gold for consumables and enchants back then, it was 1-2k gold per month, but nowdays people buy gold for items which has came to the 100k ranges, GDKP gave more power to bots and period. Classic raiding died when GDKPs became a thing and every competitive aspect went out of the window.
[1:16:23] sircrumpler: You bring immediate replacement candidates when ppl quit LULW
[1:16:30] Trexbo_: FeelsStrongMan Guzu changed for the better
[1:16:32] VinnyPezz: technically its not dirty gold cus its gold made from ways the game intended it by a creation that isnt allowed called a bot. so no the gold isn't dirty. the bots farming it are LUL
[1:16:36] SpaceCowboy0811: Too many Dads trying to get ahead with gold buying since they can't play as much anymore
[1:16:38] Kmarticus: If someone buys gold and then immediately spends it all in a GDKP and that gold gets distributed to 24 other people, does that not make it harder for Blizzard to punish gold buyers without punishing others?
[1:16:40] StreamElements: Cool IRL Posts and Pictures HERE! https://www.instagram.com/guzuTV
[1:16:41] neruk887: @Delxenyo true
[1:16:43] Mico027: The solution is not that hard to figure out, they just need to add a gold incentive at the end of a raid
[1:16:44] msmester1: 1000 g Pearl om
[1:16:48] somadaz: The Fire hat makes it super easy to take this guy seriously lol

[1:17:07] maffin1214: when someone buys gold it doesnt increase the total gold ammount on a server, its because bots are farming for gold, no? wouldnt it just fix the issue to ban bots? @guzu
[1:17:08] Trexbo_: Hmm It's almost like....
[1:17:12] CamGG__: depends on the buyers

[1:17:12] MeowgicTheCathering: FirstTimeChatter

[1:17:23] Blufootgaming: ive been running like 3-4 runs a week and still cant afford a trinket om
[1:17:23] Trexbo_: Hmm Maybe because gold buying inflates prices?
[1:17:24] banishedbakery: there are a lot 5k mmin bids raids for example
[1:17:25] daqful: it absolutely is the norm
[1:17:27] Tekgnicality: bots buy subs
[1:17:28] twitchforgotmyaccount: Just make crime illegal 4Head
[1:17:31] Vertigo_GB: No one can stop bots ...
[1:17:33] neuroxin: you can't "just ban the bots" that is so simplistic and ignorant
[1:17:38] VinnyPezz: Blizzard can stop bots.
[1:17:39] somadaz: Probably best to perma ban bots and buyers.
[1:17:40] nemzky: 4HEad Just ban them
[1:17:40] shifti_CH: i farm mats to sell in ah to buy gdkp.. why shouldn't i just buy a bot now?
[1:17:41] VinnyPezz: they just dont care enough
[1:17:43] macradarkstar: Why ban the bots when we can sell wow tokens on the AH tho?
[1:17:45] banishedbakery: not in bfd
[1:17:46] sircrumpler: 4HEad Just ban them
[1:17:49] gio57qke: shoulnd't the locked servers have lesser problems with bots?

[1:17:57] Beunhaase: 5g
[1:18:00] branz_bs: 5/10k atm
[1:18:03] notzaux: I mean usually the price of one item is the about the layout of a gdkp, which resembles usually what you get from an sr or guild raid
[1:18:04] branz_bs: normal or HC item
[1:18:05] Joxtirol: 5 g 20g epic
[1:18:08] SirHeiska: Second biggest reason is AH. We should ban it too. ;)
[1:18:09] Joxtirol: blue

[1:18:38] Delxenyo: Thats cheap
[1:18:39] Dildozer68: heyy
[1:18:42] mcboonee: 95%+ that gold is brought lol. it took me until BFA until i had the amount of gold taht these CLASSIC players are paying
[1:18:46] StrydemHS: @Guzu items go for over 300k in wrath....
[1:18:47] branz_bs: @branz_bs yea and no1 wanted it
[1:18:49] Jalapinot: @StrydemHS I got Shadowmourne for free from my guild. 10k sound expensive to me

[1:19:07] Trexbo_: It's just like... "LEGITIMATE" GDKP was never the intended way of playing Shruge

[1:19:45] dietaryadvice: PauseChamp
[1:19:48] VinnyPezz: all blizzard has to do is give the player OPTIONS... make the player decide how they want their loot in an instance.
[1:19:50] nemzky: DKP inc LULW

[1:20:24] studawg1234: This is just DKP
[1:20:26] ERNST54: ingame dkp
[1:20:26] Mico027: All you need is gold incentive at the end of the raid. thats it
[1:20:26] Regnory: What an solution OMEGALUL
[1:20:27] somadaz: takes the fun out of it honestly
[1:20:28] callexy95: so how does this stop gold buyers in raid?
[1:20:29] FueledGames: selling emblem boost runs (whoever has most emblems gets item EZ)
[1:20:30] Trexbo_: @Blufootgaming Also speedrunning is such a mute point IMO it doesn't really hurt anyone?
[1:20:30] HeadShot794: What's DKP ?
[1:20:32] neuroxin: it's like universal DKP
[1:20:34] its_me_: RMT to have others not bid
[1:20:34] Zecxx: selling emblem boost runs 100g for all the emblems
[1:20:36] DanyR: 9 min video with zero original thoughts
[1:20:37] Ticklezao: dragon kill points
[1:20:39] itouchbuttons: This wouldnt work cause everyone in the first raid will have the same amount of emblems?
[1:20:42] HeadShot794: oh
[1:20:44] sircrumpler: Token system like this doesn't fit into vanilla tho it feels more like TBC and beyond
[1:20:44] mertnl12: dude just IT THE NORMAL WAY GET FRIENDS AND A GUILD AND RAID LOL
[1:20:46] Mendziaa: zoomers do not know what DKP means FeelsWeirdMan
[1:20:46] SupremeLebowsk1: Make individual loot for everyone in the raid/dungeon. Tradeable to other party members within the instance. Ez fix.
[1:20:47] buschxz: just get a decent guild, problem solved
[1:20:48] LeeshDK: you would still need gold for the emblems
[1:20:49] myst_u: this is what I meant haha
[1:20:50] NismoTwinCam: DEP LUL
[1:20:52] myst_u: earlyer
[1:20:53] neuroxin: i'm sure Blizzard has already explored this idea and realized its flaws
[1:20:58] Blufootgaming: @Trexbo_ they didnt balance raids around having every possible world buff, they were implemented as just a fun thing every now and then, not turning into a mechanical requirement for admittance to a raid group
[1:21:00] VinnyPezz: the solution to this problem is giving us options to choose how we want our loot man.. its not that fricking hard.
[1:21:04] hondiche2: switching the gold with emblems just shows how bad the system really is..
[1:21:05] sircrumpler: This would work on wrath, not vanilla
[1:21:08] ayygord: Peacebloom system is better
[1:21:11] trez_: YEP
[1:21:11] Kmarticus: I don't think there is such a thing as a "legitimate" gdkp player because you can almost guarantee that at least 1 person in a raid is going to be a gold buyer. There's no reason people can't just do HR/SR raids or simple MS>OS. People just want an easy way to make gold off others
[1:21:13] Delxenyo: That system throws out GDKP leaders selling gold LOL
[1:21:15] mccan2110: yes
[1:21:16] sircrumpler: They really do
[1:21:17] Beunhaase: This new systems sounds good af
[1:21:19] branz_bs: je just wanted video longer than 8 mins so he can pump ads KEKL
[1:21:20] mertnl12: GET FRIENDS GET A GUILD AND GET LOOT, JEEZ XD
[1:21:21] shifti_CH: yes because fucking gearscore i can't get into a raid
[1:21:21] fist1cuffs: Wipe the servers, problem solved.
[1:21:23] HeadShot794: Some people want extra motivation to raid Shruge
[1:21:24] mordiell: dont we kinda have these with different currencies you loot from raid bosses and are able to buy item after/
[1:21:25] christiangodwarrior97: i wonder if he poops in a bucket and will have the genius idea of a toilet soon
[1:21:26] Arcsilin: its just based out of addiction
[1:21:27] Stabbe: The reward is Pumpin!
[1:21:28] kaizerlight: crazy how much people are willing to do instead of just joining a guild
[1:21:31] PaddiV: i still don't get it why Gold have 2 be such a high value... make Gold less "attraktiv"
[1:21:34] tamirerez1: i agree i like raiding
[1:21:35] FueledGames: yeah just do rolls and ms>os
[1:21:37] Counter_99: fuck no purple pixel is the reward
[1:21:37] Boneyards_666: agree with mordiell
[1:21:37] Hycubis: server wide dkp
[1:21:39] studawg1234: So how would you auction the gear? People will always just bid on their bis
[1:21:40] sircrumpler: The mindset of og vanilla where you go and do the raid and the gear is the satisfaction is gone
[1:21:48] nzcorona: if only everyone wasnt so fucking obsessed with loot lol. i stopped caring halfway through wrath and actually started having fun in the game again. so many players dont even enjoy the game they just feel like they need loot
[1:21:49] SippinSimpSyrup: Its stupid and sucks the fun out of the game to always be rewarded
[1:21:49] Trexbo_: @Blufootgaming Yeah I agree WB abuse sucks to avoid mechanics, and I get what you're saying, but world buffs are still an intended mechanic in the game, GDKP is NOT.
[1:21:49] mccan2110: @Guzu try to do a "normal" raid on classic era ( no streamer bennies)
[1:21:50] Colddaylight: Maybe wait till he's done with explaining his system?
[1:21:50] Zecxx: gl finding carries
[1:21:51] jimzan1: This is just like badge of justice in Wotlk
[1:21:51] rogueuruguayo: no, for dkp you need a guild Guzu...
[1:21:52] Suaq_Lord: i play the game for upgrading my eqiument so yeah
[1:21:52] Boneyards_666: yeah but its the same thing
[1:21:52] puntbabies: whats the difference of this and any other loot style
[1:21:53] ashuraasura: it would be different if its implemented by BLIZZARD instead of an addon tracking
[1:21:53] LeeshDK: also bosses not dropping loot would feel so boring
[1:21:53] its_me_: "trade me 200gold so i wont bid"
[1:21:54] mordiell: oh
[1:21:54] Jellooze: @Guzu  it would have been fun to see you play on a "dad" character, max 2 hours a day and no bennies/streamer favors
[1:21:56] TommoHawkk: optional, think its a solid idea, good for pugs
[1:21:56] CamGG__: id rather just play the game and maybe I get loot maybe I dont.
[1:21:56] ERNST54: just a ingame version
[1:21:58] Blufootgaming: @Trexbo_ me running a gdkp hurts no one, but whiners want to enforce their own preferred method on others who dont want to run sr pugs. thats the point
[1:21:59] positive_ions: Tier tokens in Phase 2 will help
[1:22:00] KillTouch: @Guzu make an account without anyone knowing the account and just play the game as a casual standing.
[1:22:01] graycatbirds: WTS EMBLEMS $2USD PER CLEAN TRADES PST
[1:22:01] SpruceMoose129: THe emblem system is dumb. First boss kill. EVERYONE has 1 emblem. We ALL bid 1. Everyone ties and we have to roll as normal lololol
[1:22:02] Boneyards_666: you get token from boss and trade for the item
[1:22:03] KyoouN: maybe in 40 man raids with 7 day lockout and like 0 chance to get stuff. but in sod with 3 day reset and 10 man, it doesn't matter lmao
[1:22:05] Qurco: When they didint ban Soda for gold buying that was green light from Blizzard to gold buyers well done blizz KEKW
[1:22:07] Stabbe: DKP Is still something I personally enjoy even if its dated af
[1:22:11] regularpers: how about getting a token of some kinda from the raid taht you can trade for items ?
[1:22:14] specialkidmiles: pogg Guzu undercover
[1:22:17] prodigy_wow: if you do BFD in a pug, i have a less than 1% chance to get the staff, so therefore its a massive waste of time and you shouldnt bother if you respect your time
[1:22:18] luzid7: its so funny that everyon knows gdkp but no one knows dkp anymore xDD
[1:22:18] TMMOOF: are people just lazy?
[1:22:23] mccan2110: @Guzu you won't get a grp going
[1:22:23] Ticklezao: depends on your luck Shruge
[1:22:23] nemzky: Itssuper easy to just pug people
[1:22:24] branz_bs: @guzu offstream on stream i got u bby
[1:22:26] Trexbo_: @Blufootgaming It does hurt us because GDKP incentivises Gold buying which ruins the game
[1:22:28] puntbabies: thats just your preference
[1:22:28] spardel_: YEA THER WILL BE NO PROBLEM
[1:22:28] Mendziaa: 4Head
[1:22:31] madpickl3: it worked before , why would it not work now -_-
[1:22:34] mlady_telegramz97: 4Head
[1:22:35] MeleePiper: lmao most of the ppl just doing non gdkp raid normally
[1:22:41] toooth: 4HEad
[1:22:41] mccan2110: jut gdkps
[1:22:42] 3Brick_: @Guzu the problem is i will tell you is not all guilds want you
[1:22:45] KillTouch: you been streaming to much you dont see the outside playstyle, boosting is the same as gdkp imo
[1:22:45] CasualCooky: Gold buyers arn’t going to like emblems as they buy gold because their time is limited and the no lifers that play for hours will have way more emblems
[1:22:52] macradarkstar: Just /roll for your loot like a good boy ffs
[1:22:55] ratistic: "normal" raiding isnt less rewards... Its just more sporadic
[1:22:59] Boneyards_666: Saddies
[1:22:59] Jellooze: pugs work just fine, its that once in a while shitshow pugs that kinda breaks you LUL
[1:22:59] ma_de__: who really benefit from gdkp are goldbuyers and sellers
[1:23:03] skrakampf: i literally only guild raid, cba with all the pug nonsense
[1:23:05] Horfent: straight up screws over new players
[1:23:07] redboyftw: Yea but when you sign up for the raid and they don't take you because someone else signed up with higher GS?
[1:23:08] Regnory: YEP
[1:23:08] Blufootgaming: @Trexbo_ was dkp intended? should normal dkp have been banned from the start? They never said they intended for it. Thats a very bad argument
[1:23:08] Boneyards_666: YEP
[1:23:08] kaizerlight: yep

[1:23:15] specialkidmiles: PepeLaugh
[1:23:16] Smasher16323: they're talking about level boosting?
[1:23:16] Boneyards_666: parshe carried yesterday
[1:23:17] Tigrex90: LETSGO
[1:23:18] Horfent: your raids are demonic
[1:23:18] Regnory: Boosted Andy @Guzu om
[1:23:20] thecaiyan: YEP
[1:23:21] 3verythingatonce: the biggest boss fight is filling the roster
[1:23:22] sickish: 5 man BFD boost raid. I watched it.
[1:23:22] SippinSimpSyrup: Just join a fucking guild its that simple, if too dont want to raid because you MAY not always get something, then just dont fucking raid when you dont want too….
[1:23:25] twitchforgotmyaccount: AngelThump ANGEL RAID
[1:23:27] daqful: i bet no one has ever seen this guy farming gold for his gdkp 4Head
[1:23:28] RushedFuq: cant wait for fully bis chars to troll por randoms by looting everything in a raid just bc they can
[1:23:28] branz_bs: I HAVE A FEW CLIPS
[1:23:30] VinnyPezz: that was an honest mad " HAVE YOU SEEN MY RAIDS" moment
[1:23:30] trez_: guzler pugs TrollDespair
[1:23:30] ozak0s: @Guzu This game is for 30+ year olds with children and jobs etc. Sometimes it's hard to commit to 1-2 specific hours or nights of the week to raid with a guild
[1:23:38] Qurco: Imagine paying +20g per level in wc? 99% gold buyers so should we ban boosting too?
[1:23:42] Yngvarrior: Too many gatekeepers for common mortals btw
[1:23:42] LeeshDK: @RushedFuq THIS
[1:23:51] neuroxin: yeah Guzu's raids definitely never spend 3 hours on Halion
[1:23:53] shreddingog: Every item is a Guzu item raids
[1:24:02] branz_bs: too many casuals
[1:24:02] ma_de__: Just pug it then
[1:24:02] Jalapinot: Then play something else
[1:24:03] sircrumpler: So then pug with a roll system or SR???
[1:24:06] SirHeiska: @guzu Its shocking but your raids are still farr above normal
[1:24:06] notzaux: I mean you just 5 manned bfd no wbuffs, most people not gunna swing that
[1:24:07] kaizerlight: @Qurco yeah
[1:24:08] mordiell: @ozak0s but no, thats the thing, the game ISNT for people like that. It's for kids that have time to play it
[1:24:11] nemzky: then play retail, like seriously if thats how you need to play youll have more fun
[1:24:12] SippinSimpSyrup: @qurco so you think they should ban any kind of boosting? Not just level boosting.
[1:24:13] daqful: then play something else 4Head very simpler
[1:24:13] VinnyPezz: ozak0s thing is without those 30+ year olds wow would be dead.
[1:24:15] VinnyPezz: sadly
[1:24:17] plaguefart: Why are people so obsessed with playing the game as badly as we did in 2004?
[1:24:18] Ticklezao: tik tok brains need tik tok games NODDERS
[1:24:19] mordiell: its just that kids dont want to play it
[1:24:19] 3Brick_: @Guzu the only problem i have as a solo player is that i need to quit going DPS and go Healer or Tank for people to like me or want me in their guild/raid or groups. I dont have friends who play classic or to play with in general i run around org and duel people outside this is why i pvp
[1:24:20] branz_bs: WTF SHOCKING?
[1:24:24] nickylas: do sr runs instead then, tbh if u dont have time you shouldnt expect to be full bis and best at it?
[1:24:27] msmester1: if you dont have time then dont play migh be biased but it is waht it is go do lfr on retail or idk
[1:24:27] mlady_telegramz97: just play something else 4HEad
[1:24:27] Blufootgaming: @Trexbo_ SR runs encourage people to leave when their item doesnt drop. Guild loot incentivizes people to scam others and leave people high and dry. there are bad actors in every system, i wish we didnt have RMT. but if we ban a system for having bad actors, we would have 0 systems
[1:24:30] branz_bs: u got best RL in the game ofc they gonna be good
[1:24:32] alextheblight: Second Life stream when?
[1:24:33] trez_: eh mmos are for boomers
[1:24:34] sircrumpler: "oh no one guy rng won all the gear I wanted" ok and gdkp someone and buy you out?
[1:24:35] mordiell: and we want to relive the fun we had playing it as kids and teenagers
[1:24:35] Stabbe: @ozak0s thats why if you have a guild you set 1 day a week to do the raid and for the other resets you sort yourself out if you have the time
[1:24:47] shifti_CH: implement LFR in classic? KEKW
[1:24:49] Lappi_Koski: personal loot NODDERS
[1:24:49] amruta_ray: no time for mmos but spend 6 hours on phone
[1:24:49] mccan2110: as it should be :D
[1:24:52] Vertigo_GB: instant gratification generations :D
[1:24:54] MeowgicTheCathering: gaming is just different now Aware
[1:24:55] CamGG__: getting a good guild solves a LOT of problems
[1:24:56] MeowgicTheCathering: Oldge
[1:24:56] Jellooze: maxing out one character is possible even for someone that dosnt play a lot, especially in SOD
[1:24:58] VinnyPezz: shifti_CH dont you dare say that again KEKW
[1:25:05] poopooindiaper: Good afternoon @Guzu . Just had a quick one
[1:25:08] RushedFuq: @Guzu so if ppl are full geared and didnt need those new dkp emblems they can just join a random raid and buys out everything bc emblems will not be worth anything next phase?
[1:25:08] MeowgicTheCathering: Jamgie
[1:25:14] Ticklezao: this guy is scaring me
[1:25:15] Papfar: so he wants blizzard to make a new ingame system for loot, Guzu ?? thats makes no seens
[1:25:16] mccan2110: @shifti_CH for 1 raid
[1:25:22] mccan2110: :D
[1:25:25] MeowgicTheCathering: Stare Talk
[1:25:29] shifti_CH: i deman lfr in classic monkaHide
[1:25:31] Trexbo_: @Blufootgaming My point is, if a style was never intended and has toxic side effects, then you shouldn't cry when Blizzard takes actions to remove them Shruge
[1:25:33] Ticklezao: @MeowgicTheCathering guzomE
[1:25:33] Mico027: You dont even need the token shit, just give gold at end of raid
[1:25:35] MeowgicTheCathering: Saved he blinked
[1:25:39] MeowgicTheCathering: hooooly
[1:25:40] StreamElements: Sub to the IRL channel NOW! Madge https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2
[1:25:40] Zecxx: wtf would the moderate reward be? sounds like the opposite of a gold sink
[1:25:41] theonlyxice: Does anyone know if this guy blinks ever?
[1:25:45] VinnyPezz: shifti_CH ... Pepega
[1:25:46] toooth: Cheesed
[1:25:52] layziep: This guy is so frickin wholesome
[1:25:52] shifti_CH: guzuGiggle
[1:25:54] SippinSimpSyrup: Waaaaa waaaaa waaaaa i need loot every raid, if i dont get loot ill make a stinky poo
[1:25:57] layziep: I love him
[1:25:57] marmaducus: hes not blinking
[1:25:57] sircrumpler: I dislike that the positive focus of gdkp is it incentives people to play even with full gear. Do people really not just keep doing raids cuz it's fun when they have full bis?
[1:25:58] DanyR: I hope you are having fun Starege
[1:25:59] TommoHawkk: Sr raids can suck as everyone needs something, this system will bring in people that dont need items just to cash in embelems to npc
[1:26:01] chasingshadowsz: ok fireman bill
[1:26:02] Ticklezao: NPCing  he showed a human reaction pogg
[1:26:03] neuroxin: I'm pretty sure the gold sellers are just holding him ransom and this is the ransom video
[1:26:05] mordiell: @marmaducus he is
[1:26:05] foy314: this is already in tbc and wrath is Dungeon tokens from each boss ?
[1:26:07] AlternateProject: oh poor guy, no gdkp
[1:26:09] cmn1997: Do raid without? god man wtf hahah
[1:26:11] SupremeLebowsk1: Why not just do individual loot? Everyone gets a piece of gear that can be traded within the instance. Works fine in other games.
[1:26:11] Jalapinot: Knew it, he is big time biased
[1:26:12] branz_bs: he scares the shit out of me
[1:26:13] rodel_media: wrath does the emblems already.
[1:26:18] kzenjo: he's adorable but i hate gdkp lol
[1:26:18] ERNST54: he is chill
[1:26:18] ClyroTV: iAsk If you want to raid in an organised manner then join a guild or a pug discord that does SR/MS>OS runs - you will already have the discords set up for SoD when GDKP is disallowed
[1:26:20] sickish: he has the best rogue content
[1:26:21] regularpers: the problem with thjose kind of videos is that he puts too much of his experience in his arguments and disregard the rest
[1:26:23] Scif64: salting
[1:26:24] trez_: Susge
[1:26:28] mcboonee: i hate his hat
[1:26:34] toooth: peepoTalk
[1:26:34] sircrumpler: @clyrotv YEP
[1:26:37] kzenjo: @mcboonee LOL
[1:26:39] skrakampf: level headed well presented argument, even if you disagree he makes some good points
[1:26:43] 3Brick_: @Guzu the only problem i have as a solo player is that i need to quit going DPS and go Healer or Tank for people to like me or want me in their guild/raid or groups. I dont have friends who play classic or to play with in general. In other words i am not desired as a mage player
[1:26:51] fredputterman: @jalapinot he literally said 40 times he does them
[1:26:53] layziep: Absolutely
[1:26:54] Blufootgaming: @Trexbo_ theres so many other toxic interactions that don't get punished, and people who never gdkp demonize and otherize anyone who prefers it. This sets a horrendous precedent for the next thing reddit demonizes Shrugeg
[1:26:56] TheGreattDane: Nerf hunters is all i heard
[1:26:57] DanyR: Notifications: (4807) peepoBOOM
[1:26:59] efracozz: How is not good for the game when it increaes raid attendance
[1:27:08] sircrumpler: My main issue is a system like this does not fit in vanilla imo
[1:27:10] Jazminite: @Guzu iAsk Did you watch the Asmon video on GDKP?
[1:27:16] arobba: its insane how much he looks like a young preach
[1:27:21] TMMOOF: it wont lol
[1:27:21] trez_: Deadge
[1:27:22] Stabbe: Then we let it die
[1:27:23] sircrumpler: I agree
[1:27:23] dietaryadvice: D:
[1:27:23] i__mak__i: The reason people like gdkp so much is that if an item drops that they want they can just throw gold at it, i would imagine that most people dont want to raid week after week just so they can lose their item on a /roll. You can argue that just join a guild and play the game that way but then the loot is in the hands of the loot council of the guild which in some cases they wont want to give loot to a new guy that just joined the guild
[1:27:24] nemzky: for sure
[1:27:24] plaguefart: so many of the points against GKP are 'but this (goldbuyers) is the state of the game', but then have no interest in the fact that playing the game the 'proper way' isn't the state of the game either.

[1:27:50] avantistellarossa: Playing game "normally" is for gdkp users GDKP raids. This is something that people enjoy. U are saying play with a guild but there are people out there that can not fit  the timeframes. You say then, go pug, but PuGs are gambles by itself. I mean thats the point of MMO actually, to find a community that suits you, and you do you. There are ppl that play game just to collect gear for transmogs. There are ppl playing pokemon games inside of zhe game.
[1:27:50] Trexbo_: @Blufootgaming IMO I think Blizzard should take action against other toxic elements too ok so we can agree on that, granted Reddit may not be the BEST forum for player feedback, but then again Idk what forum would be lol
[1:27:50] branz_bs: i didnt do a single GDKP in son adn im having fun, and i do GDKPS in wotlk all the time..i dont think its gonna die

[1:28:14] flumiscent: if wow dies we all will know who killed it (azamous ofc)
[1:28:14] shreddingog: seems a bit shortsighted but I didnt hear his whole pitch. Was stop someone from raiding for 3 weeks with green parses stacking up emblems to buy a purple weapon over the one who did the heavy carrying?

[3:01:25] ChairmanofGaming: Lucky rockets, they give a 25 yard buff for your raid. +250 hp stackable for 30 minutes.
[3:01:26] MlLKYBLAST: Guzu what did you get ME for Valentine's Day? :)
[3:01:27] Emil129c: but very easy to grief

[3:01:37] StreamElements: guzu said CBA 2430 times!
[3:01:37] Ranzinz: Ranzinz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! i know im wrong from have bought gold (dad with almost no time to play), but getting suspended for 14 days while i see streamer like sodapopin having no harm is quite the slap in the face
[3:01:37] StreamElements: Ranzinz just subscribed for 2 months in a row PogChamp
[3:01:39] mordiell: i dont see valentines day as like actual thing
[3:01:46] mordiell: we dont really celebrate it here

[3:01:56] draqcula: @mordiell BASED
[3:01:57] xelm_: @mordiell it’s okay to be cheap. I’m cheap too.
[3:01:59] Foodlebar: guzus presence is her present
[3:01:59] Nunadaaa: @mordiell most of the world doesnt, its just another American holiday to get you to buy shit
[3:02:00] Lissard: I got caught Madge

[3:02:35] specialkidmiles: @mordiell this is a trap Guzu don't fall for it
[3:02:36] xelm_: true

[3:02:42] ChairmanofGaming: Lucky rockets give a 30 minute +250 HP stackable buff to all allied characters in 25 yards. I think they will be super useful in GNomer.

[3:03:41] specialkidmiles: @guzu you are 100% going to get grieved on this quest also
[3:03:44] reteeh: @ChrisLeboucher kidding
[3:03:45] fridxa: she will give you something and you will feel bad

[3:03:53] ChrisLeboucher: reteeh who knows
[3:03:53] fetza108: I shit on the gifts too. I love my family and domt need gifts. I buy what i need.
[3:03:56] Knocktoff: im fine with valentines day but it feels crappy when you go to stores and its being pushed to you at every corner, feels too commercialized
[3:03:56] Foodlebar: you got her that surstromming @Guzu what is more romantic than that
[3:03:58] mcboonee: buy savix some edible undies
[3:03:58] ScootSmith: I can see it now, guzu tells mordiell he thought they would just play some wow together, and her response will be "its fine"
[3:03:58] specialkidmiles: guzuL
[3:04:03] nomnok: noone forces you to be romantic. I agree with Guzu but that doesnt mean you cant do something nice anyway. I guess just do what feals right?
[3:04:06] SimoAzzo: the trap is if you think about it you are doubting her attitude and you don't know her so you're wrong, if you don't think about it you are wrong because you're not thinking about her
[3:04:06] DamDamPew: @tw1ZTER LUL
[3:04:06] mordiell: as someone that prefers quality time over material stuff, i never really cared that much about holidays and gifts tbh
[3:04:07] Poketschike: how to get prepped for p2? dont get preppt its called season of DISCOVERY
[3:04:07] toshko321: okay… Guzu… will you marry me?
[3:04:08] shreddingog: Do it 2-3 weeks ahead of the special day so they dont get insulted when the day comes and they get nothing
[3:04:09] Nunadaaa: @ioHelios but yea I dont really believe in having a specific date. Cause it also generates expectations and when not met (even tho you dont know what the others expectations are) people get dissapointed
[3:04:09] Enlok: YES Pog
[3:04:10] Blufootgaming: who names their kid Muglash

[3:04:32] Kazay1998: @Nunadaaa I agree with that so much
[3:04:33] Nunadaaa: @ioHelios I prefer something real a lot more, something cause someone WANTED to do something for their significant other. But thats just me

[4:29:28] imraduin: I love mead, my friend makes a batch each year. He makes it from honey base but I guess that's the thing...
[4:29:30] Bensiano: i had a rough day :/
[4:29:35] xelm_: guzu u should show us at some point id be interested in your meed content
[4:29:38] Mr_Cobblepot: it popped
[4:29:39] dre__222: why is the TB pond clear of bodies on your server?
[4:29:44] Esten80: @Guzu what lvl will u be at launch?
[4:29:47] LuminescentLlama: @LuminescentLlama wololo, uses a shield that negates your spell
[4:29:50] hanttapuliukko: I'm wondering if you can ferment mead, or produce it, with champagne method to make it a bit dryer and bubbly. Just gotta find a proper storage and a "champagne stand" or whatever it's called
[4:29:55] Mr_Cobblepot: yes it did
[4:29:57] mlady_telegramz97: om om
[4:29:59] Djinx_o: I fish using the sound, Can't fish with anyone else there fishing xD
[4:29:59] StreamElements: FULL game playthroughs of variety games and entire vods can be found here! https://www.youtube.com/@guzuvods196
[4:30:11] Mr_Cobblepot: just blame us
[4:30:15] PyhaTonttu: you have to use the right yeast that can live in high enough alcohol concentrations. I guess the problem with mead is that the yeast doesn't get enough nutrients, which means it won't necessarily ferment in its full potential.  Have done mead few times.
[4:30:17] Janniwow: stop reading chat now Smadge
