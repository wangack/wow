[1:42:35] BingoTingler: Surely drinking alcohol, taking synthetic mushrooms, kratom, dabs and overeating will solve his mental problems. Exercising, eating healthy and limiting his drug intake would never work.

[1:44:48] SmellyGoatZ: !ask can fungal spores survive in outter space
[1:44:50] StreamElements: @SmellyGoatZ Fungal spores have the potential to survive in outer space due to their ability to withstand harsh conditions like extreme temperatures and radiation However further research is needed to fully understand their survivability in a vacuum environment
[1:45:01] bignickyg123: he took 5 grams?
[1:45:02] trabyss: @BingoTingler haha 5g, i dont think he took even 1/3rd of that
