[1:17:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: finally hit 1100 last night and finished punika, now I just need a full set of gear to drop from chaos today
[1:17:37] Pvt_Cornflower: Hones *
[1:19:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: luckily they changed the event vendor to not have an ilvl requirement so i can at least buy out all the high level stuff before weekly reset
[1:19:23] GrimMSickles: finally hit 1370 today
[1:19:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: was in the notes
[1:19:59] MrSapient: yes it was part of it.. but it isntr working either
[1:20:05] pimpmy: SeemsGood
[1:20:08] MrSapient: the ilvl is still on the items
[1:20:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: well shit
[1:20:16] Sir_Frosty1: how about the people that got randomly banned for 3days, can they buy out before reset?
[1:20:18] ilo0ney: Only works for engravings

[1:20:59] TuRDz__: he watched a lot of videos about the release of the raid early
[1:21:04] skipflex: honestly pissed me off
[1:21:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: when i left luterra yesterday at the port i didn't see any bots stuck
[1:21:19] nextlvlninja: They banned so many people who  have 500+ hrs just playing the game
[1:21:24] Moobot: largecheesenips, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[1:21:25] PotatoWin: same haxor
[1:21:25] Pvt_Cornflower: Yeah man boy cries about the 1350-1370 deadzone
[1:21:38] TuRDz__: they banned ppl for RMT lol with 500hrs
[1:21:43] ilo0ney: They just need to add all the venders that the Korean version has
[1:22:02] Grizzlybooey: its mainly about argos being out to fast, and not having the mats to reach 1370, f2p
[1:22:08] chiefiskeith: I'm having too much fun playing the game to worry about what other people think
[1:22:21] Tahj____: He said the game has the risk of damaging it's own image and playerbase very quick in it's current state
[1:22:29] ProButcher: Gmorning folks
[1:22:31] ProButcher: :D
[1:22:31] MrSapient: @ilo0ney i was reading we have 50% less venders for honing then KR
[1:22:33] TuRDz__: towlie you try out the soulfist at all? shit is DOPE af lol
[1:22:41] Pvt_Cornflower: Too many people are putting emphasis on ilvl and ignoring the equally important horizontal progression
[1:22:49] JrocThaGreat: dead zone
[1:22:51] ArbyWan: Got to t2 last night, can't wait to see all the honing fails on the way to t3 lol
[1:22:57] ilo0ney: @mrsapient yeah we missing a lot of venders
[1:23:07] JrocThaGreat: EXACTLY!
[1:23:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: my focus is catching up on other games anyway, lost ark is gonna be here for awhile no reason to rush
[1:23:21] DaddyyyTim: im about to hit 1340 i have clsoe to 300 hours D:
[1:23:24] darkdestroz: @Towelliee did u get anythin good in vault?
[1:23:25] ProButcher: @ArbyWan Yo me too! Grats on T2!
[1:23:40] Sir_Frosty1: yeah, only money i spent on the game was $15 to get bronze founder pack for a headstart. now i get a ban for playing +500 hrs. kinda messed up tbh
[1:23:45] phavens: Accepting materials from his viewers doesn't prevent him from empathizing with people who aren't swiping or taking donations.
[1:23:47] TuRDz__: in fairness, asmond was saying - he was handed stuff so he has no right to be mad or say much about it. basically he shared videos of stoopzz
[1:23:55] ilo0ney: Once you get to 1350 upgrades are rough
[1:23:59] Tahj____: That's true
[1:24:01] ProButcher: Finished Yorn and spike up from 600 to 940, which is a little wild to me
[1:24:25] Tahj____: I think people would be pissed about the GS requirement no matter when it came out
[1:24:35] TuRDz__: asmond was defending people who arent whaling, was saying they pushed it too early
[1:24:42] JungleCreep1: You are not the avarage player.  Most people dont have 10 hours to pay this game
[1:24:47] MrSapient: Wep repair
[1:25:04] ArbyWan: @ProButcher Cheers man, yeah the jump is kinda.. Crazy lol
[1:25:05] wobblevibes: people been playing through new content for a month now and are upset after that month they have some free time
[1:25:30] PokerFaceMoose: it is hard to balance catching the west up with KR and releasing in a way so as many people as possible can enjoy the new content.

[1:26:16] panalofps: build?
[1:26:33] TuRDz__: asmond wasnt doing anything wrong tho.... just informing ppl whats going on
[1:26:38] JrocThaGreat: Naw shroud is to grounded for that shit, has to much money, so he has no reason to chase. Still dont why Asmon bothered
[1:26:40] MrJebs0: i actually don't mind being where i'm at (1345). I just log in every day or every other day and do some shit
[1:26:40] ProButcher: @teamnoypi You on PC or mobile?
[1:26:49] TuRDz__: asmond just trying to inform ppl whats going on
[1:27:12] panalofps: @teamnoypi i meant game
[1:27:15] JrocThaGreat: @TuRDz__ it could have came from someone that actually knows, he is just hearinga bout it. There are 3 dozen other videos about from other more informaed people
[1:27:47] ProButcher: Actually Towelliee that encapsulates it perferctly
[1:27:52] ProButcher: I'
[1:27:56] TuRDz__: thats why he was sharing stoopzz video
[1:28:01] TuRDz__: he openly said that
[1:28:04] tehrobtar: echo just ogt the crab down - caught up with liquid now
[1:28:13] Darthyrevan: Lets go EU!
[1:28:15] ProButcher: I didn't really recognize that I've been feeling 'behind' this entire time... But that's not at all how it should be approached
[1:28:42] Keytamei: falling behind what ?? lol
[1:28:43] Collected1: no idea how echo survived that
[1:29:19] TuRDz__: stoopz has more EXP than anyone and has said over and over- play the game at YOUR pace and dont worry about rushing
[1:29:27] TuRDz__: everyone rushing are wasting money
[1:29:30] tehrobtar: right? was definitely a wall boss for sure
[1:29:35] J_Rich94: ppl just need to realize they are not going to be able to keep up with twitch streamers in MMO's you guys have so muhc more playing time than non streamers
[1:29:36] Collected1: glad they got it before reset. going into the reset with that many pulls and no kill must sting.
[1:29:38] tehrobtar: i think they were at like, 74% yesterday for andy?
[1:29:49] JrocThaGreat: Stoopz has alot, not more than anybody, lol
[1:29:49] Cyrix12: I'm at around 400 ilvl still KEKW I can only play 2-3 times a week for a couple of hours due to work
[1:29:51] Corpseking: does anyone know if timers were actually fixed?
[1:29:54] fakevaltteri: Liquid got Anduin to 64 I think
[1:30:08] fakevaltteri: But they weren't really pushing, just fine tuning strats
[1:30:19] OvenMonkeyGaming: because you have them already
[1:30:28] quicktrip2k: I think Asmon's video is crap. The same grind he experienced that he's bitching about was there between the other tiers too. He just didn't experience that grind since his followers were giving him shit constantly. Now that they can't he had a grind it seems.
[1:30:28] OvenMonkeyGaming: it wont show unless its an upgrade
[1:30:28] TuRDz__: same with SaintOne too, hes said the same thing - Saintone has like what 20k hours or some shit
[1:30:32] TuRDz__: he said pace yourselves
[1:30:47] TuRDz__: SaintOne is very informative
[1:30:52] 91Niki: YEAR OF THE SPEAR (ditto)
[1:31:24] JrocThaGreat: @TuRDz__ mmhmmm, we got it

[1:52:02] KonaWolfeee: @peajayz yikes lol I never had an issue gearing until the end of t2. it's rng year

[1:52:58] zlane: i know it takes a long time, but what happens when you get to 60? anything special?
[1:52:59] KonaWolfeee: chat if he's on Una and I'm on Regulus . am I able to send him gold through the mail or nah?
[1:53:14] panchojack11: @peajayz you can do islands aswell
[1:53:17] cikez: 1000 to 1100 is killing me with these 70% fails

[1:54:18] cikez: Yeah same. I have failed multiple 90%..... Beginning to think their percentage code is f'ed lol
[1:54:20] Dred_Scythe: Quick question to chat, if you want to use an Una's extra daily item, does it have to be used before you finish your three dailys?
[1:54:31] 1_tofu: @Dred_Scythe nope
[1:54:33] panchojack11: @peajayz you can make alts as well
[1:54:37] KonaWolfeee: @dred_scythe nope
[1:54:55] pjhqt: ugh i hate the idea of required alts
[1:55:08] OvenMonkeyGaming: should be in the one i linked
[1:55:11] KonaWolfeee: @towelliee do you know if we are on same region but different server if I can send you gold?
[1:55:13] pjhqt: why cant you just spamm abyss dungeons or raids and get hella mats
[1:55:15] cikez: The honing percentage shit will make a lot of people quit unfortunately
