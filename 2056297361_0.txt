[2:04:52] msqtwar: I got honed and ritual dagger for single minded, I feel like it does more than fathomblade, but fathomblade feels cool lol
[2:05:00] Winttyrr: i ran the raid earlier today, and kelris dropped his dagger for the first time ALL FUCKING PHASE, and some dog shit mage took it

[2:07:01] tinkerinohao: How will war perform in pvp in p2. MS is huge
[2:07:03] creaturesfan72: @Winttyrr i mean yeah but it's also a caster wep
[2:07:21] skjaldmo_o: I am pretty sure if you save them as highlight they should never delete them
[2:07:28] Winttyrr: @creaturesfan72 yeah i get that, but the mage in question was pulling less than tank dps
[2:07:29] skjaldmo_o: but saving them also on youtube is a good idea
[2:07:31] Barokoshama: Sonii, can you play THAT song, or is the vibe not there right now.

[3:10:38] thundercawp: seems like it shouldve been a bfd mount
[3:10:42] firemondave: brother what is that addon that turns you into an undead? I need undead shaman in my life…!
[3:10:44] itselijer: you'd ride it huh? dirty girl

[3:11:41] thundercawp: bobka bought heaps of stacks of crests for 58 silver each
[3:12:10] Rapapep: @bronchoped1 unless you plan on playing 2h fury or arms you could be using it for a long time.

[3:25:46] scolh: warrior will farm and there will be threads asking for nerfs
[3:25:48] st0neh: I suspect every phase warriors are gonna be complaining at the start then by the end shitting on everything. It's the warrior way.
[3:25:50] jewelerdiaz: at the end of the day its still classic with some extra buttns lols
[3:25:50] Dimpleshift: I mean warriors are insane, how can you give them more insane stuff without widening the gap? honest question.
[3:25:51] hoagie117: im just excited cuz i like SoD but we are the least fun class lol
[3:25:52] rick_dolton: im ok lol
[3:25:56] babyjay1313: Im curious to see wher arms is gonna take me\

[3:26:25] XamusTV: @SONII what addon changes you apperance and can you be banned for it?
[3:26:25] RedChaosTV: when they give use bezerking throw, were we rain down axes on a area like 100 of them ill might be pretty sweet
[3:26:39] st0neh: @Dimpleshift Exactly, warrior is always right on the edge of being busted with one minor change
[3:26:57] scolh: yeah warrior lacking in that regard for sure
[3:26:59] reefo: only performance matters
[3:27:03] sneaky937: pretty funny how they said they dont want wars to be op but they keep giving them runes KEKW
[3:27:03] slobberjaws: sod is ascension

[3:27:26] chilemangx: I think most players will be happy if warriors on top of DMG meters
[3:27:31] chilemangx: most warrior players
[3:27:41] Sn00ters: it's lame that warr got zero dynamic changing runes so far
[3:27:50] hoagie117: i hate this slam playstyle, top dps may not be worth it
[3:27:53] sungyy: Was hoping for more creative runes etc. - not necessarily wanting more dmg
[3:27:53] scolh: warriors got the least amount of buttons
[3:27:58] scolh: by far
[3:27:59] sneaky937: even as someone who has a warrior main i dont want to see 4+ browns in raid
[3:28:00] frontlinr: @SONII what spec are you leveling as to 40?
[3:28:07] DonAwaAwa: if a class can go from wet noodle to god, it makes gear dopamine that much better
[3:28:09] Rapapep: I dont think gnomer is going to be that demanding you would have to class stack to clear it. Unless they really fuck up and overtune it.
[3:28:10] RedChaosTV: when will warriors get to heal
[3:28:20] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[3:28:21] Dimpleshift: @SONII I will
