[0:23:00] kholerww: yo, late to the party, what emb are we testin
[0:23:12] Sokchoy: lunch recomendations?
[0:23:18] CaffeinatedFennec: Watch PoV vods helped me learn a lot. Then mimic their rotations, until you learn why it works.
[0:23:19] bobikrumov: Its a bit hard for me to play higher keys since the class I am healing with its not from the meta and ppl are not giving me chance so the only way is to do my key
[0:24:22] xGuiha: what embelishes are you trying out?
[0:24:56] kholerww: ah party chest
[0:25:15] nash25pl: whats being tested ?
[0:25:19] Sokchoy: you should spec crit over vers way more bang for buck
[0:25:43] Bronloch: they need your heals to break 30
[0:25:56] xGuiha: might scale with vers

[0:27:15] Bronloch: i would do it LUL 487 is huge
[0:28:13] Sokchoy: you're losing about 2% throughput from your crit/vers balance being too vers heavy
[0:28:15] honeyyyyyy: You ever take time off wow?
[0:28:39] Bronloch: 1 piece of gear thats a little off spec aint the end of the world LUL
[0:28:45] Bronloch: 487 is huge tho

[3:14:09] bonjourdaisy: i refuse to play treeform druid - thoughts?
[3:14:28] Pannitra: Pannitra subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:14:46] tvilk: Tree is better if you want more Healing, Convoke is better if you need more damage
[3:14:49] tvilk: its really that simple
[3:15:03] uncl_iro: uncl_iro subscribed with Prime. 
[3:15:33] tvilk: yeah but you also gain extra value from convoke in Everbloom because of the dmg amp on bosses

[3:20:07] bonjourdaisy: lol
[3:20:59] whitewolfstarcraft: Jb question in your opinon is it better yo have a 24 inc monitor or larger is better ?
[3:21:17] Thatsafy: @whitewolfstarcraft preference and how far you sit from monitor
[3:21:36] Rypick: @whitewolfstarcraft also depends on if your playing FPS or other games
[3:22:01] tvilk: When it comes to games like WoW size doesn't matter and it's all preference. If you want higher FPS in games you go for smaller sizes. And in competitive FPS smaller is better too
[3:22:37] sylvija_96: I just got a ultrawide and diablo is destroying me XD
[3:22:39] tvilk: you're good with your words

[3:23:35] Thatsafy: @testosteronald yeh uw for wow is rly nice, can just push all needless stuff to the sides and have middle free for actual stuff that matters LUL
[3:23:38] tvilk: I have 2x 27" too, but I don't like it. I think it's too big for me
[3:23:59] testosteronald: @Thatsafy yep cant go back
[3:24:20] tvilk: DinoDance
[3:24:42] tvilk: No sorry, but smaller monitors generally have lower resolution
[3:25:06] tvilk: There's 24" 1440p monitors for sure
[3:25:12] whitewolfstarcraft: Am going to get a 4090 soon any recommendation ?
