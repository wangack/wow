[3:46:46] tvilk: that will help you in the future
[3:47:26] Dissperia: you dont really want to play aug and ret together
[3:47:43] MuffinCompiler: @Scripe can you share the WA with the 2 1 ... merciless assault countdown sir
[3:47:45] tvilk: yeah but maybe not you specifically but as a group
[3:47:50] Durbesa: @hatralqt While thats true, if u checked details all of em are due to uninterrupted casts or juggernauts to melee
[3:48:00] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Scripe and enter code: ECHO
[3:48:14] Durbesa: Still not my best key really

[3:48:42] tvilk: do the pastebin upload thing
[3:49:14] Scripe: https://api.paste.ee/p/FaIeJ
[3:49:17] tvilk: ty
[3:50:35] tvilk: thats why you dont dodge storming, you soak them
[3:50:45] tvilk: harder for casters ofc but melee should soak
[3:50:59] mohaso21: i was soaking as much as i can
[3:51:10] tvilk: ye tank definitely need to soak
[3:51:21] mohaso21: but at the same time
[3:51:37] mohaso21: having my party not insta thinking with me and stacking
[3:51:39] mohaso21: does not help
[3:52:18] tvilk: that pull 8 is an aids pull..
[3:52:21] tvilk: so much running
[3:52:40] tvilk: oh sorry no pull 9
[3:52:42] tvilk: the 3 people
[3:53:22] tvilk: pull 14 requires coordination on cc tbh

[3:55:21] Dissperia: you dont really want to play aug and ret together 󠀀
[3:55:42] tvilk: aug is 3min cd ret is 2min afaik
[3:55:56] Justflux: I am 1 min cd as ret
[3:55:59] tvilk: then im wrong
[3:56:04] MuffinCompiler: ye aug 2min
[3:56:04] Justflux: but I also agree
[3:56:10] Justflux: ret doesnt seem too good with aug
[3:56:11] Dissperia: ret helps stabalise the group and does more dam than bringing an aug, so if you run an aug you wanna run 2 squishy dps like mage/boomie
[3:56:37] MuffinCompiler: @Scripe can you share the WA with the 2 1 ... merciless assault countdown sir
[3:56:50] tvilk: its meeres WA from a while ago that he changed
[3:56:58] tvilk: he used it for axe throwers in season 2
[3:57:02] MuffinCompiler: oh gotcha
[3:57:26] tvilk: im pretty sure the CD is 9.x seconds

[4:41:52] MuffinCompiler: worth
[4:42:21] tvilk: 20 mil? Sure
[4:43:09] tvilk: later?
[4:43:17] tvilk: so you just stand afk for 10 seconds or what?
[4:43:24] tvilk: thats a waste
[4:43:25] mohaso21: no
[4:43:28] mohaso21: you should not
[4:43:35] tvilk: you're just saying to wait for padding dps meters
[4:43:49] MuffinCompiler: or just drums instead of waiting 1min
[4:43:55] MuffinCompiler: or what
[4:44:03] mohaso21: i coulda drummed but nah
[4:44:20] mercurialllll: If ur only having 1 boss atmpt, anf u can delay for lust start, he id saying to wait for lust
[4:44:22] mohaso21: where did you  lust for youself that you didnt have it?
[4:44:47] mohaso21: fair ye
[4:45:07] mohaso21: XD
[4:45:13] tvilk: im not saying the first lust was bad
[4:45:24] mohaso21: ye keep pulling scenario out of your head its fine
[4:45:25] mohaso21: KEKW
[4:45:26] tvilk: im saying there's no reason to stand afk 1min just looking at boss to make sure you have lust off cd
[4:45:49] tvilk: im arguing against you wanting to stand afk and wait for lust cd
[4:46:06] mohaso21: i mean i coulda  used drums but i just didn't do it
[4:46:10] MuffinCompiler: Chatting
[4:46:22] tvilk: the part where you want to waste 1min just standing afk
[4:46:31] tvilk: you can kill the boss in that time
[4:46:33] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[4:46:35] tvilk: just kill the boss
[4:46:58] tvilk: so you want to wait afk because you expect to wipe or what?
[4:46:59] Cazlul: its to mitigate the danger of wiping lmao
[4:47:04] mohaso21: its not a waste for one reason, ffirst phase is very safe and 2nd reason this is last boss in the dungeon and we all know that he doesn't take that long time
[4:47:11] mohaso21: so waiting was gonna be fine
[4:47:38] tvilk: so you wait to decrease chance to wipe and potentially not time the key
[4:47:38] MuffinCompiler: YEP you have only one try anyways, so just wait for lust
[4:47:40] Cazlul: and wipe = brick
[4:47:53] Cazlul: might as well wait to make sure you dont wipe
[4:47:57] mohaso21: regardless if you wait or not if you wipe in both cases key is gone
[4:47:58] MuffinCompiler: @tvilk that was not a danger
[4:47:59] mohaso21: so why not wait?
[4:48:39] tvilk: just kill boss
[4:49:07] MuffinCompiler: Echo tvilk when
[4:49:32] mohaso21: KEKW
[4:49:37] mohaso21: i love this conversationj
[4:49:40] tvilk: you can do more damage in that 1 minute span of waiting than you can do in that extra 10s of lust
[4:49:42] Eliannoula: nah, and thats why he' stuck at 'low keys'
[4:49:43] tvilk: just kill
[4:49:52] MuffinCompiler: KEKW
[4:49:54] Justflux: who sabotage the ret
[4:50:01] tvilk: why are you planning for failure
[4:50:07] topazz12: mr dripstick, how aws my pala
[4:50:13] Cazlul: hes trolllinngggg
