[3:09:52] WilleySlippery: theres nothing fun in it
[3:09:53] LesbianGnomes: If there's no grouping, I bet you people will let themselves die to each other so they can basically AFK the event.
[3:09:53] djukares: i play resto druid, and there is no dual spec yet, so im screwed that way
[3:10:02] 0mark0v: SOLO-PLAYER take

[3:21:15] psokys: its a team game Kappa
[3:21:19] miriapodzemos: @Locofanta are you new to the game?
[3:21:22] ama__deus: If it encourages group play, that wouldn't be too bad, but it probably just encourages zergs in groups of 5
[3:21:22] gn0x: its about efficient farming rather than pvp
[3:21:23] kultaporkkana: atleast bgs are solo now

[3:21:34] Peoplewhinetoomuch: FFA game mode .. but oh no wait nvm
[3:21:36] ama__deus: Ashenvale was PVE LUL
[3:21:38] Istunlocklocalpensioners: hmm
[3:21:39] th4les: it was meant to be a FFA event
[3:21:41] sawier9133: they didnt nerf grouping enough it seems
[3:21:42] aquexen: so how are healers suppose to get coins?
[3:21:46] elothon: @kultaporkkana what do you mean with solo?
[3:21:49] Istunlocklocalpensioners: yeah they need to sort this out, I think the debuff idea you hadisgood
[3:21:49] kromjsi: how do people enjoy this event as MELEE?????
[3:21:50] TheAlkemist: IS THISTLE TEA STILL LEGAL?
[3:21:55] shadofa: you havent seen 2 5 man groups grouping yet. now thats cancer

[3:22:36] Istunlocklocalpensioners: at least as a rogue you can chill in stealth while the chaos ensues
[3:22:39] Livrah: lame event
[3:22:45] HeinMuck: jimmy jimmy neutron
[3:22:45] Istunlocklocalpensioners: at 40 you will probably oneshot most of them anyway
[3:22:47] kultaporkkana: its classic no 1 plays solo they are bad so they need 10 people to 1v10
[3:22:50] ama__deus: @butterzugzug shitty if you're the 1, but at least it's not completely zerging LUL
[3:22:50] kromjsi: melee for this event is just boring as FUKC

[3:23:08] TheAlkemist: so ccringe
[3:23:14] SAMO0RA1: should be free for all solo
[3:23:17] wprogress: should be solo only
[3:23:17] Lamarin: blizzard will listen COPIUM
[3:23:18] unlucky_clown: i mean, if you farmed warsong rep. you get new neck/ring/bracer/weapon at lvl 38 - big boost
[3:23:18] PinkSonicFan: change no blood coins for group
[3:23:19] sebastian_x69: revert all rewards, and undo groups
[3:23:22] gn0x: not like rogues searching for easy targets in stealth
[3:23:25] kultaporkkana: atleasst bgs are made solo frendly now
[3:23:25] sawier9133: they said groups will get some kind of handicap is that not the case?
[3:23:26] kromjsi: i was leveling my rogue im gonna level my hunter no way im gonna play this as cancer melee hell noooooo :(
[3:23:42] layziep: heroBlanket

[3:23:56] Murveldonk: just ban all groupers for a week!
[3:23:56] thistleex: STVietnam
[3:23:58] ama__deus: In a raid, not in a party
[3:23:59] sk3pnad: Why even call it a Free For All event?
[3:24:02] th4les: YOU CANT RAIN ????? Pog
[3:24:06] layziep: So I can't really hear rn at work but.. I am looking.
[3:24:11] layziep: esfandStare
[3:24:13] ultimatefeelgood: people are always going to group up for these pvp things... no idea why blizzard thought otherwise
[3:24:16] miriapodzemos: @th4les yes rain cant him
[3:24:20] Locofanta: they said it would be a punsichment on big groups/raid
[3:24:21] kult1010: my hero doing pve during pvp event FailFish

[3:24:41] steffenomg: Whats the duration of the event?
[3:24:41] Thymiantim: no other zone to quest? this looks pretty scuffed
[3:24:43] sawier9133: 90% dmg and healing received reduction when in group
[3:24:47] inflict_54: need party
[3:24:47] gn0x: also its like they made the best questing area in that range unplayable
[3:24:56] urudliv: sod is lame
[3:25:00] sebastian_x69: AGREE
[3:25:01] Lucons1: he is disappointed
[3:25:01] ama__deus: That would be interesting
[3:25:07] kultaporkkana: true
[3:25:11] lostmyaccount123: wouldnt it just be an easy fix if they made it so people in groups didnt get blood?
[3:25:16] chesterbrock: this is modern world of warcraft
[3:25:20] Deverser: they really thought less rewards was gonna deter people from grouping
[3:25:21] alkahestone: They're partying with each other overpower class
[3:25:23] kromjsi: no wonder there arent any QUUEEUES for SoD Phase 2 with this BULLSHIFT :)  :) :)
[3:25:25] Locofanta: party of 5 stealth, one shot everbody...

[3:26:37] pirateex: Does that even give you  AB rep tho ?
[3:26:39] kromjsi: its just awful to look at melees playing this event LMAO
[3:26:55] th1lio: reminds me of the helltides in Diablo4
[3:26:58] Yakku_: so, do zou lose blood when killed or not, ccos sometimes i do sometimes i do not
[3:26:59] ama__deus: You can turn the coins into AB rep
[3:27:09] ama__deus: @Yakku_ you do, but not ALL your blood

[3:27:13] ear_shot: where is combat potency rune
[3:27:19] PinkSonicFan: he farmed 1500 copper 1 event he got all 3 epics
[3:27:31] Yakku_: @ama__deus  do we know how much? like half or sumthin?
[3:27:32] ama__deus: @PinkSonicFan they fixed that shit exploit nonsense
[3:27:34] alkahestone: Is it a failed party that only OP classes do?
[3:27:39] ama__deus: @Yakku_ not sure
[3:27:41] kromjsi: @miriapodzemos What is good then? Mage?
[3:27:43] Erixx: games would last heat to long when they were equal.
[3:28:08] IvanDolovic: Hey blizzard said that it won't be the best to run around in groups because they will probably be penalized? is there such a thing for the event or doesn't it matter?
[3:28:10] rudeeboi: Krappa
[3:28:14] Lucons1: yikers

[3:29:40] SAMO0RA1: the F in Blizzard stands for fun
[3:29:40] ama__deus: I get that they want to encourage groups, but there would have been a better way to do this. Then again, 5v5s sound dope in STV
[3:29:43] PinkSonicFan: why did u not rush 40 get shuriken toss and spam graveyard and save 1 week of farming

[3:30:23] Chank0ff: They can go after
[3:30:24] kromjsi: Should i level my hunter from 25 instead of my rogue from lvl 30?
[3:30:25] weahhc: After
[3:30:27] shadofa: u keep the stacks
[3:30:28] kromjsi: rogue look boring af now
