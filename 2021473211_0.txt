[1:37:05] chrisrev: anyone in chat know what the best Sod server is for playing horde?
[1:37:11] Purgatan: Yeah, I have really enjoyed DF
[1:37:39] ambiotic: I did not like crafting at the start of the xpac so its not in my top 3.
[1:38:00] smashwow: yeah but you've said since the beginning because it doesn't have an AP grind it wouldn't be that high for you
[1:38:07] PotbellyGoat: I had so many characters in BfA and Legion

[1:38:30] Colt_Engineer: I thought the artifact weapons system was great, I was highly disappointed when it would only stay with us 1 xpac
[1:38:43] Slitze: bfa was the last descent expansion
[1:38:49] ambiotic: Essences, Corruption, Azerite Gear and the neck was the grind
[1:38:52] theDirtyon3: Man legion and BfA were the best times of WoW IMO
[1:39:00] im_capy: grinding to fly in bfa was a little rough, just cause of the zone
[1:39:07] metavahn231: and then it was gone forever
[1:39:07] smashwow: corruption was the only one that wasn't attached to AP though.
[1:39:13] ambiotic: And mechagon dailies
[1:39:15] Ordicos: think everyone loved that tier
[1:39:17] blooodraine: now i have the legoooo on my warrior i realy cant understand why the evokers dont have a catch up thing for the new raid for there legoo.. @Towelliee

[1:39:25] theDirtyon3: Kreygasm
[1:39:29] metavahn231: lego
[1:39:38] Slitze: last 2 expansion were meh after the first month
[1:39:43] Purgatan: Top three for me would be Wrath, Legion, and Warlords
[1:39:53] metavahn231: forums raging about geting worst lego
[1:40:01] Mmmarcoman: Expansions are kinda much like music in a way: Younger people enjoy way more past eras like '80s than older people enjoy something from last 10-20 years :)
[1:40:09] im_capy: I felt like I owned my own Island I was doing those so much
[1:40:10] smashwow: nah that leggo shit was the worst thing that could have happened to the game pre 7.1 when they fixed that
[1:40:11] Colt_Engineer: I don’t want to hear it, you had streamer luck with your Lego’s
[1:40:13] theDirtyon3: first month of Dragonflight was the best tho
[1:40:18] ashwing_: Legion until 7.2 was questionable at best. The only saving grace were the Order Halls
[1:40:29] snake_like: getting pre-buff sephuz moon2PAIN
[1:40:53] smashwow: M+ also saved that xpac honestly

[1:41:51] MattyjTV: i wouldnt say its the worst of all time
[1:41:54] ambiotic: You could only get 3 leggos at the start and if you got the wrong drop you were fucked for months

[2:04:38] ambiotic: Fall is prob the easiest key this eason
[2:04:51] smashwow: well you can partially blame the community for the healer thing. when everyone yelling it's a healer affix yeah i wouldn't want to play healer either
[2:04:53] Colt_Engineer: I’ll take all that over the damage the mobs put out
[2:04:55] theDirtyon3: yeah i think they missed with the mega dungeon this expac

[2:05:37] lithium364: bring unnerfed seat back kekw
[2:05:37] rockhell12: I hate Chromie so much
[2:05:40] Colt_Engineer: @smashwow I used to argue for days with people about explosives being a healer affix.
[2:05:59] ambiotic: People don't really do bait things well anymore
[2:06:12] DanRock90: you use the frontal to kill mob
[2:06:16] theDirtyon3: LUL
[2:06:23] smashwow: @Colt_Engineer every affix is a group affix. whomever has the best toolkit is first up after that it's everyone to pitch in period

[2:07:49] Eshel: “oh - and we’ll put a lot of shit on the ground so the little bitch just disappears” lol
[2:07:50] ambiotic: What is funny is the most dangerous thing to pugs in Fall/Rise is the shield phase on iridikon, people get hit by those spikes every single pug
[2:07:51] Nerendis: Launch morchie was 10x easier with 2 people dead. Such a bad design.
[2:08:03] SamuraiWillZ916: and this is why SoD is popular and took 50% of the wow community away from retail lol
[2:08:05] LeXieSterling: I hope they get it straight before we all end up in nursing homes

[2:10:51] Zolshy89: I mean it was also the easiest
[2:10:52] ambiotic: Because you need to stand still to not take damage when getting dispelled. It says this absolutely nowhere in the dungeon journal
[2:11:09] ambiotic: Mechagon was the best, then Kara
[2:11:18] ambiotic: Junkyard was the best
[2:11:20] ambiotic: give me the buffs
[2:11:32] smashwow: tbf JY played itself with bots

[4:23:49] Kneckt: towKek
[4:24:02] Starclassics: Blizz "fresh" beats the other options out there like new world or lost ark - that sparkle and fade out quick
[4:24:02] TheEyeVII: at the very least it's a good quarterly report sub-boost and gimmick to present to investors, even tho their actual sub value most likely is server-maintenance
[4:24:06] force_FMD: we fresh again
[4:24:07] Nokterian: KEKW

[4:25:41] wybielacz: duo found!
[4:25:41] im_capy: agreed
[4:26:01] CousinAvi86: I think the worst part of it is you can't use quest reward items and can only run a dungeon once...
[4:26:06] im_capy: itll give you something to do when bored at most imo
[4:26:18] Civiius: SSF will be interesting until a guild full clears
[4:26:19] zodd_amhai: it just dropped rip
[4:26:25] Hyelander_: Classic Catas gonna be the biggest flop
[4:26:33] AzedaNA: I mean how do you beat SoD? I just haven't been able to think of any other crazy ideas that could come after
[4:26:36] Rudric_Ice: I think SSF will only be popular with streamers and not the general playerbase
[4:26:59] sprert: but SSF also means no streamer-handouts
[4:27:30] Coresmoke420: @sprert no hand outs but they always find ways to benefit from it
[4:28:10] Aidler: crazy I know but I never, in the past 10+ years, run out of things to do in retail
[4:28:11] Nerendis: @sprert lol, sure
[4:28:16] im_capy: SSF gonna have more bots than players kek
[4:28:25] Jose_619: Jose_619 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 77 months! 
[4:28:41] Nerendis: Why would you bot ssf? omegalul
[4:28:44] im_capy: sell accounts
[4:28:53] Civiius: Can trade at max level
[4:29:03] Coresmoke420: no trades no quest loot just drop n vendor items
[4:29:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah the self found stops at 60
[4:29:17] Coresmoke420: 1 run per instance
[4:29:43] Nerendis: Remember when reddit said that bots wouldn't make it to 60 in hardcore. That shit was funny.
[4:29:55] AzedaNA: If you believe the Classic subreddit only bots play WoW Classic and all of them buy their gold
[4:31:15] geokouts: other side
[4:31:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: sell a 60 self found hard core character and log them out in a elite zone so they die once they log in
