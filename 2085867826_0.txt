[5:07:03] zachl_: @yumytv why u think they both play flourish in here?
[5:07:04] zero_rawrxd: did they mess up the broadcast and show a random pug key instead
[5:07:12] baseboned: VE is cracked
[5:07:25] marcofellipe69: nah
[5:07:26] AvalenaTV: castercurse is real
[5:07:28] marcofellipe69: cd timings

[5:07:32] zachl_: vi
[5:07:34] zachl_: i mean
[5:07:42] zachl_: if u had to pick im def not taking flourish in here
[5:07:54] marcofellipe69: they used all their lead to even out
[5:08:00] marcofellipe69: now it falls on pure dps
[5:08:02] d1_____________: how many more series left?
[5:08:02] zachl_: or hear me out drop that node entirely for uh
[5:08:04] zachl_: smth cool
[5:08:06] Italicuss: what are you munching on over there
[5:08:12] Vods: Thats why you are not in the MDI @zachl_ Okayge
[5:08:15] IAmSolari: I feel disgusting when I have to heal tanks in pugs
[5:08:26] marcofellipe69: I think eclipse
[5:08:27] zachl_: @Vods i dont think i wanna be either OMEGALUL
[5:08:27] Ajatus: wouldnt flourish technically be a damage button with vigil?
[5:08:29] marcofellipe69: has better pure dps
[5:08:36] marcofellipe69: it's straight forward from here for the most part
[5:08:38] aiv_: <3
[5:08:38] jenkinsdonuttv: Shadowpriest funnel probably?
[5:08:39] zachl_: @Ajatus *technically* yes
[5:08:40] Larocca_88: <3
[5:08:41] tvilk: <3
[5:08:41] Fatroids: as you're currently playing it, would you recommend Elden Ring to someone that hasn't played a game like that since original DS?
[5:08:41] JulesMcSwaggerak: <3
[5:08:42] Ralem_: <3
[5:08:50] fat_european0: mage wants 3 or less for intensifying flames
[5:08:56] Briar_L: Anything that is not 4 is good for mage
[5:08:57] Denz_9: you don’t want 4
[5:09:00] Ajatus: @zachl_ technically damage is more damage than not taking it
[5:09:01] zachl_: but they dont have the same cd any longer @Ajatus so its annoying to play around + flourish is VERY weak atm, you and ur flourish are week
[5:09:09] fat_european0: it does help the ST, but it's not massive
[5:09:17] zachl_: they both used to be 1.5m and it was rlly good to pair with flourish but
[5:09:22] zachl_: now its kinda stinkee
[5:09:22] Not_aFox: is it Bussin @yumytv
[5:09:28] Cruzerthebruzer: perplexed has 10% more count
[5:09:29] MBG_95: thats a big dps dif
[5:09:37] tvilk: yummytv
[5:09:39] jenkinsdonuttv: Perplexed bout to be Eclipsed
[5:09:40] kiri4869: maybe flourish for big dragon pull
[5:09:41] Briar_L: I know prerework it was about 1% funnel per target
[5:09:47] baseboned: what about bat tech
[5:09:53] Ajatus: just macro it into vigil and dont care about pressing without vigil
[5:09:57] voldeekay: Eclipse has the live keys experience you can tell from those pulls
[5:09:59] zachl_: @kiri4869 i can see that
[5:09:59] MBG_95: rocket boot was instead of a dmg pot tho right?
[5:10:06] zachl_: flourish a good cd for more than one dragon
[5:10:09] Cruzerthebruzer: ya it costs you your pot
[5:10:09] IAmSolari: @yumytv ask JB how the rocket boot tech compares to the bats in BRH
[5:10:20] baseboned: wait how did eccilse catch up? or less count?
[5:10:35] tvilk: leeches are 1% each
[5:10:47] tvilk: and there's 6 leeches
[5:10:48] tvilk: in that area
[5:10:56] marcofellipe69: eclipse
[5:10:59] throwmasterlol: they did more then 6 im sure
[5:11:00] marcofellipe69: has a 75% chance
[5:11:01] marcofellipe69: to win
[5:11:02] tvilk: if you skip drakes you take all leeches
[5:11:03] marcofellipe69: with dps
[5:11:09] tvilk: if you dont skip drakes you leave behind 4 leeches
[5:11:09] marcofellipe69: experience can beat dps
[5:11:18] marcofellipe69: but this aint it
[5:11:20] Emm_Zee: They fear sigiled the chunks

[5:46:02] Cantwingrr: what's weird is, I agree and most people do, DF was a lot better than Slands but I played Slands way more and am not really interested in playing atm even though the dragon stuff is cool af
[5:46:04] Emm_Zee: The only reason this patch is even close to good is that last season was literally the rock bottom ICANT

[5:46:39] Gujacha: I would argue that s2 was way worse
[5:46:41] baseboned: the thing is you dont remember the times SL was dead because you just remember when you WERE playing, not the breaks, there were definitely long dead times in SL too
[5:46:46] yujik46: @mistrblocker yep it was
[5:46:46] Melancholy_Mode: s2 was giga bad
[5:46:47] Arkanheal: @zachl_ I deffo disagree
[5:46:48] fat_european0: @yujik46 True. This is the worst xpac for m+ so far
[5:46:48] tvilk: @zachl_, now youre cooked
[5:46:48] gloomygl: Season 1 was GOATed
[5:46:51] riiirn: season 2 before aug was good
