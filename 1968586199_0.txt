[5:37:24] cendaiii: NO WAY they're doing 144m DPS tho, can yall stop saying its DMG done this fight and dmg done in the whole dungeon. Left is just a DMG done overall and right is that number x10, its wrong.
[5:37:25] CaptainBattlaxe: @thedrikster Right?! It's crazy how good they are. I can not believe the #routes they take.

[7:14:42] nerazuri93: GG just sweating sending this team lol. All other teams are just sending random teams and they playing with this team who pushs the highest keys every week.

[7:17:30] x_Scy: nerazuri93 team ambition was most likely attending blizzcon anyway, they all play for the GG raid team, they are not tryharding, they just play like they usually do
