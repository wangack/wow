[1:32:51] raselsuggy: cant see sts either
[1:32:59] raselsuggy: or am i blind
[1:33:08] vbx93: and the taste wa is also poorly, i just realized it turns grey when he used the proc instead of it vanishing
[1:33:10] notmorbos: it only lights up briefly when it procs
[1:33:29] sifjhdnbfgb: @vbx93 of course it does when it’s on cd
[1:33:44] vbx93: look it stays there even though he used op and the proc is gone
[1:33:59] vbx93: it shoul just vanish no?
[1:34:03] sifjhdnbfgb: @vbx93 yes because it’s on cd
[1:34:14] vbx93: true im stupid
[1:34:16] shozgodx: shinta built diff
[1:34:26] NurfMe206: did flash glyph make that big a diff, or u guys just frmaing em now

[1:35:20] NoManele: Shinta talking nice things about you :D
[1:35:21] vbx93: just copy one of them
[1:35:25] Eonx: if you can't see a phat taunka then a WA isn't going to save you
[1:35:27] vbx93: and change the names in trigger n stuff
[1:35:29] Eonx: Chan's thought process
[1:35:40] NurfMe206: DBW one costs extra. but u can duplicate the one for WFS and change to the proc name of DBW
[1:35:40] Moobot: www.Twitter.com/Minpojke_ & https://www.instagram.com/jonandersson92/ and https://discord.gg/STTWtwwDet
[1:35:50] Zeberdy: just duplicate one of the other trinkets and change it to the ID of tonka
[1:35:58] raselsuggy: but u cant see sts proc atm
[1:35:58] notmorbos: still nice to see the duration
[1:36:00] blastoidzzz: I literally just started using weakauras as well its easy to setup though
[1:36:08] Turaxyy: Ey Minpojke :) can you not go above 3268 for my mental sanity ? tyvm :)
[1:36:13] vbx93: just duplicate anbother trinket
[1:36:18] ixffyy: is Shinta best warr whitch you play in 2s ?
[1:36:20] vbx93: and change trigger names
[1:36:36] notmorbos: the WA chan uses only lights ups for like 3s when the trinket procs and doesnt show duration
[1:36:43] notmorbos: i think this is supposed to be in the middle of your screen
[1:36:54] vbx93: above the frame ofc
[1:37:04] notmorbos: adding DBW is annoying because its like 5 different IDs and then you might want nhc too
[1:37:09] Aytuo_: check grp
[1:37:40] Turaxyy: idk
[1:37:50] raselsuggy: turaxxy is low

[3:43:00] Deicidiumx: Imagine getting arthritis
[3:43:14] solairewow: @Deicidiumx You use that in arena's?
[3:43:17] Deicidiumx: of course

[3:44:52] Deicidiumx: I hold them like a sir
[3:45:00] solairewow: I can see why its more comfortable than spamming keys. Since a key can sometimes not interact due to much usage. But its not getting banned? Kinda interesting blizzard doesnt care

[3:46:09] Deicidiumx: But i'm still expending energy to pull my finger muscle donw

[3:50:04] mrbigpizza: i actually think the percentage is higher in mid rating than high rated 3k+ games and therefor get less attention since its not recorded gameplay and also the enemy lacks the confidence and experience to call it out properly
[3:50:05] burningtruths: @solairewow ok, thx

[3:51:29] PancakesDota: @Minpojke Yeah the cheating sucks, do you think that arena would be better with no addons? Especially not seeing CDs
[3:51:32] AnnxxR: @Disection no its not, ure more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome
[3:52:23] potatoinname: @annxxr - get a better keyboard, adjust position and dont hanmer buttons?
[3:52:28] AnnxxR: its the same as people who spam play piano etc
[3:52:37] Apendix23: cosmetic addons are good but information ones would be better to not exist
[3:52:39] dsaucemaster: thats because we are old
[3:52:40] Apendix23: just lowers the skill cap
[3:52:44] Turaxyy: I think the game would have been bad without gladius / gladdy

[3:54:31] Xeriyo: ye u can with macros solaire
[3:54:37] Deicidiumx: and you should have to solve a chess puzzle every 5 globals

[4:35:33] xarlivenow: it is
[4:35:37] gaalmonkey: also that yes, I know ppl who quit pvp cause they couldn't be bothered to raid for bis trinkets
[4:35:38] MarthozTv: was the same in tbc tho no?
[4:35:40] xarlivenow: ppl dont wanna pve to pvp
[4:35:47] RealOrangePaint: the moment you take a break you need to buy gold to catch up

[4:36:55] gaalmonkey: Do you think an actual pvp tournament real like blackrock on warmane would work if blizzard did one?
[4:37:00] gaalmonkey: realm*
