[2:40:04] DekarianOSU: @bonerboost make ur assumptions man i choose to wait and see, based on their words nothing you are saying is confirmed
[2:40:04] tomo123: they can make mobs evade back
[2:40:04] fazrawdes10: just add leash protection
[2:40:06] opuhol: This is big grief potential
[2:40:06] actbig9: the guard kiting desperately needs to be fixed, the fact they aggro onto people if their initial target vanishes
[2:40:07] f3elsok: yeah but the 60 has to make it to 60 first
[2:40:09] bagelbiites: Griefers can die too though so its more risky, might stop some
[2:40:10] PogChamp_Enthusiast: you will also be lvl 40 at that point
[2:40:10] daLuhz: now were going to end up with griefers who are actually good at the game Aware
[2:40:11] 39billy: maybe theyll change leash distance
[2:40:12] GarbageM4n: If they don’t figure it out, nobody will enjoy the experience.
[2:40:12] Higgs22: They will make it so mobs can't be kited long distance on HC servers.
[2:40:12] mejstroo: @ThirteenJhm13 what a come back. 40 year old virgin
[2:40:12] BrutalTrue: for softcore is fine to kill 2-3times, but to snipe on hardcore is kinda nah it is too much grief.
