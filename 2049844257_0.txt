[2:35:34] farenbal: Sadge getting ganked 2v1
[2:35:34] Syron1x: fear, run out his drain before you put your drain on

[2:38:00] gdkpgold: feared as wl ICANT
[2:38:10] watanuki_: what , noone can kill you when they are in melee range
[2:38:28] chr47: Feral cat runes for next phase are terrible, bear got a buff  at least
[2:38:38] painkillab: Cryng
[2:38:47] Blayde_24: how do you think shaman will be with 2H potential?

[2:38:48] AllOfKingsPotato: retail gladiator
[2:38:55] hapjaa: ICANT
[2:38:55] znau_: its like they grow in trees
[2:38:56] toter_s: why would they put an alliance rune in the barrens..
[2:38:59] chr47: Yeah
[2:39:03] Arisnadia: tiger fury?
[2:39:03] PapyOG: KEKBye
[2:39:04] AllSublime: Feral druid runes are greaet
[2:39:06] MrPancakxs: feral runes are insane next phase
[2:39:09] Arisnadia: lmao feral druids are gona be op
[2:39:13] AllSublime: Feral is gonna crank lol
[2:39:14] trmonx: and regen and berserk maybe
[2:39:17] chr47: ferals have lots of energy what's the point?
[2:39:22] exteps: its just gonna be belt and bracer runes for p2 right?
[2:39:24] chr47: it lasts 6 seconds
[2:39:26] frederikjonj: Gym when ICANT @jokerdtv
[2:39:29] Tactics_lol: Pummel too
[2:39:31] Arisnadia: plus the rune that gives claw % to reset tiger fury?
[2:39:31] AllSublime: No shred next phase
[2:39:31] trmonx: and its off gcd
[2:39:32] Phumy: Ferals geht a 3min CD on an Item that is insane
[2:39:34] BasimGGs_: @toter_s could say the same about them putting a horde rune in the cave of redridge
[2:39:36] Slyxen: @toter_s because it is not an "alliance" rune. runes are not faction based
[2:39:38] ertra123: @chr47 stop tying you just get lower and lower iq every message lol
[2:39:38] Shelbro: @JokerdTV do you think powershift is worth it in p2 ?
[2:39:41] drgeemo: what layer is this?
[2:39:45] AllSublime: Mangle is gonna hit harder than shred lol
[2:39:53] drgeemo: I never see any horde
[2:39:59] chr47: shred is not 40 energy
[2:40:04] PumpkinTME: I’m looking forward to to shockadin pally
[2:40:05] MrPancakxs: mangle will hit harder then shred
[2:40:07] AllSublime: It's 300% weapon damage, and it will get the 20% buff from talent
[2:40:10] lonzo_22: 60 energy
[2:40:13] Slyxen: shred is 60
[2:40:20] Egis4: talents
[2:40:20] tollw00t: shred is 42 with talents
[2:40:23] AllSublime: So 360% weapon damage compared to 225%
[2:40:31] Syron1x: mangle is more dmg/energy than shred
[2:40:37] Egis4: savage fury
[2:40:41] easterr__: fights to short for shred
[2:40:45] easterr__: mangle is bis
[2:40:49] chr47: without clearcasting mangle is better
[2:40:51] AllSublime: Savage fury
[2:40:55] easterr__: less energy and more casts
[2:40:57] Egis4: savage fury increases mangle damage
[2:41:02] AllSublime: Increases claw damage by 20%, mangle is effected by things that effect claw
[2:41:16] micronetic_one: SMOrc  GET HIM BOYS
[2:41:17] MrPancakxs: its an average of 140 more dmg per shred cast compared to mangle
[2:41:19] AllOfKingsPotato: Deadge
[2:41:20] gdkpgold: loosing to real gamer xdd
[2:41:21] AllSublime: So mangle will get 20% damage increase and only cost 35 energy
[2:41:27] nerunehru: cat sims pretty good right now, the only issue is that its about a 100 personal dps loss to run leader of the pack
[2:41:38] MrPancakxs: shred is only worth using currently on clear casting procs
[2:41:53] Shelbro: @nerunehru so we still furor in p2 ?
[2:41:57] PapyOG: need lube in da barrens
[2:42:01] mongolstwitch: Is there any info how much XP you get on BFD? or they havent info that yet.
[2:42:04] DeadnessTV: mangle benefits more from tigers fury flat dmg too right?
[2:42:08] Spoxah: Deadge
[2:42:12] bassiemon123: So not sure how 2h shaman going to work next phase. 30% attack speed from rune, 30% from passive talent. Then u can add troll racial and crowdpumler for another 50% + then helm giving u 20% aswel. Not sure how that will work out.
[2:42:26] AllSublime: It's just swapping one filler for another, so I don't think Blizzard will care
[2:42:31] Streamlabs: Get 20% OFF + Free International Shipping @Manscaped with promo code "JOKERDTV" at https://manscaped.com/jokerdtv
[2:42:33] chr47: currently yes, but with rune it is 15% flat
[2:42:39] MrPancakxs: tigers fury gives 15% more dmg and 60 energy on the new rune
[2:42:50] AllOfKingsPotato: MmmHmm
[2:43:01] luckylosta1: whats the evis/envenom for cat?
[2:43:10] chr47: they gave cat a bunch of energy saving runes for a spec that has more than enough energy already, just kinda stupid design imo
[2:43:17] Arisnadia: 60 energy every 30 sec is incredible uptime
[2:43:21] Cypfer: pew pew combo
[2:43:25] Noduckras: Will there be 2 new rune slots at 40
[2:43:30] Brain_Freezed: ferocious bite @luckylosta1
[2:43:35] nicohd1tv1: !addon

[2:43:39] Streamlabs: https://clips.twitch.tv/PreciousSuspiciousPandaTBTacoRight-BfGfRmSZ93JtrDYH
[2:43:39] MrPancakxs: feral is powershifting currently if you want to parse
[2:43:40] Syron1x: powershifting makes feral enjoyable ngl
[2:43:40] gdkpgold: rogue dps gonna suffer next phase, immune to bleed and poison
[2:43:43] AllSublime: Probably no power shifting, raid is gonna force you to take LotP lol
[2:43:47] Cypfer: and helm is p3-4
[2:43:54] DealGame: realy?
[2:43:54] Keidouh: boots and cats
[2:43:54] AllSublime: Or your warriors all rage
[2:43:57] varkshot: What is this version of the game where the screen is grey all the time? What is the purpose of intermittent periods with colour??
[2:44:03] Egis4: deep feral xddBedge
[2:44:05] chr47: you 100% will powershift
[2:44:08] Can_I_Get_a_lirikH: how will you level in P2?
[2:44:11] AllSublime: Power shift will be better for you probably, but LotP is gonna be great for raid
[2:44:13] Shelbro: powershift is nice but i'd rather go full feral if it works
[2:44:16] DealGame: Helm is data mined but is onl P3?
[2:44:19] Diamsofer: powershifting > 3 % crit
[2:44:26] MrPancakxs: power shift will definitely still be meta next phase, a wolfhead trophy thats applyable to all helms was datamined
[2:44:29] Brain_Freezed: Everybody thinks warrior is gonna be insane pumper next phase, and then they realise most bosses are immune to bleed KEKW
[2:44:30] diadel__: what do u think is best dps for the raid? deep feral or powershifting?
[2:44:32] Vanilla_Punch: Is it worth doing the raid at launch? @JokerdTV
[2:44:38] Shelbro: @MrPancakxs lol
[2:44:39] DealGame: Than helm is more likely changing a lot
[2:44:44] gdkpgold: did you see what they did to dungeon items
[2:44:45] haringvisser: en-fors -> fors-en
[2:44:46] PumpkinTME: frost or arcane mage next phase?
[2:44:49] AllSublime: @MrPancakxs I didn't see that when I went through the items
[2:44:49] lonzo_22: full feral more fun
[2:45:00] WhoHazCake: WHAT
[2:45:02] MrPancakxs: @AllSublime Its on wowhead
[2:45:05] Tafson: Your job is to give buffs to the brown bois
[2:45:21] chr47: bears take lotp, no cats gonna run that shit
[2:45:33] AllSublime: @MrPancakxs Link?
[2:45:43] MrPancakxs: Can i post a link to wowhead?
[2:45:48] magentas: kewk
[2:45:51] AllSublime: You can DM me
[2:45:52] Brain_Freezed: brown boys are probably gonna suck next phase because of mechanical bosses @Tafson
[2:45:58] MrPancakxs: gotcha
[2:46:04] thegummibearmassacre: GDKPs DOCBOZO
[2:46:06] Tafson: @Brain_Freezed KEKW instant class slam go BRRR
[2:46:07] 21up21: how are you dual wielding staff and dagger
[2:46:10] Tafson: *cast
[2:46:19] nemlol: Well in some of the top speed runs they use 2 ferals ... if bear was actually good it could fill 1 of the spots
[2:46:22] watchmeaim: if best dps they take
[2:46:24] Pogsible: 9 melees and a priest
[2:46:25] nerunehru: its almost 100 personal dps loss to have leader of the pack according to sims. its going to be toxic to get feral to run it in pugs
[2:46:33] Brain_Freezed: yeah, you are right as well, but still no deep wounds will reduce their dps a lot @Tafson
[2:46:47] bassiemon123: Might
[2:46:48] AllSublime: Blessing of Might
[2:46:49] shadowcaelic: might
[2:46:57] exteps: hope shamans get increased imbue time like pals with their blessings
[2:46:59] dkramo: and better wf..
[2:47:10] 21up21: alliance ratchet pov :D
[2:47:14] 冂凵乃口: 2 feralse boome anr resto rgud KEKW
[2:47:17] Tafson: @Brain_Freezed The major variable is Rage generation based on damage. not Deep wounds. Deep wounds is very high in damage right now because warriors are often rage starved.
[2:47:20] bassiemon123: Next phase shaman
[2:47:22] exteps: itll be shaman if talented
[2:47:39] Paradofix: shamans can also twist
[2:47:44] Brain_Freezed: People on mage discord thought of going 2 mages 1 for winter's chill and one for imp scorch debuffs, and playing frostfire bolt so it double dips @JokerdTV
[2:47:45] saund: you're talkikng strictly for minmax and parses right?
[2:47:46] 21up21: wtf. where is the horde on this server
[2:47:48] painkillab: shaman will have totem too
[2:48:02] Brain_Freezed: @Brain_Freezed yea we will see what happends
[2:48:07] andros299: WF IS LV40 ON SHAM
[2:48:08] vesand: twohand or dual wield as warrior
[2:48:16] 21up21: living flame horde disappoint
[2:48:23] thegummibearmassacre: GDKPs RIPBOZO
[2:48:23] bassiemon123: The new shaman totem is garbage, unless its like party wide.
[2:48:24] Tafson: The trick is we wait until Father Aluheaundo shows us how to play our class., then we take top DPS spot
[2:48:38] vesand: how tall are you
[2:48:41] gdkpgold: catS  briing back the cats

[2:49:32] h00dr0b1n: @Kiewicz92 shortking
[2:49:38] saund: with how they tried to include everyone to be viable, 20 man would be way better yeah, cause then shadowpriests would be accepted in BFD phase
[2:49:39] magentas: KEKInsane sun on cat
[2:49:41] ShingaTV: is impossible in 10 y
[2:49:45] boopbopbamski: i am the 10

[2:49:52] painkillab: JOKERD THERE IS AN ANGEL BEHIND YOU
[2:49:54] Peilo241: its not even necessary since the raids are easy

[2:50:02] magentas: ICANT
[2:50:04] h00dr0b1n: sub 180 = short king for sure
[2:50:08] YzieGG: but u can fil the raid faster if u dont need all
[2:50:13] nerunehru: do you think pyroblast rune is good or is crit % not high enough in classic
[2:50:14] vk_jp: youre right but 1 : not all class are necessary, 2 : its easier to get a 10 man going
[2:50:23] magentas: @JokerdTV what is that glowing creature behind u
[2:50:28] chr47: 10 man is so lame, it's just a dungeon basically
[2:50:31] ShingaTV: meele meta NotLikeThis
[2:50:41] xSagale: I find 25 man perfect size
[2:50:44] boomstick093: 10 man is fun as hell
[2:50:51] 0xm0_hk: sod for casual YEP
[2:50:51] dkramo: Each hit has a 20% chance of granting the attacker 1 extra attack with (122 *) extra melee attack power.
[2:50:55] Tafson: its a casual phase
[2:50:57] muztho: anyone wanna do gnomeregan gdkp ?
[2:51:00] a_wesker1: boomer lfr raiding KEKG
[2:51:04] saund: with how they are banning GDKP and trying promote guild playing, would they want 20 man?
[2:51:08] ShingaTV: let gnome fuck us hard the first lockouts D: wont be balanced anyway i guess^^
[2:51:15] Tafson: SoD is the participation trophy of WoW. Its for all the casual players to feel like they arent sucking.
[2:51:19] neejla: very casual but everyone tryhards, whats the point
[2:51:24] thegummibearmassacre: GDKPs RIPBOZO  󠀀
[2:51:30] Teazir27: 10 mans is cool for loots
[2:51:41] ShingaTV: ^^
[2:51:46] vk_jp: id argue that kelris is atleast as hard (or easy, phrase how you want) as what any boss in vanilla
[2:51:48] GavriilArchAngel: hentai
[2:51:49] bluebloo__: did you see gdkp organisers quitting the game KEKL
[2:51:51] drgeemo: Sergeant Giga kek
[2:51:52] Teazir27: Fck 40 mans for Gear
[2:51:56] Tafson: TRUEING
[2:51:58] saund: yeah no guild officer wants to make 5 signups and deal with people not showing up
[2:51:59] thegummibearmassacre: @bluebloo__ KEKG
[2:52:01] saund: its so annoying
[2:52:04] Fissed: gdkp is bad for the game
[2:52:10] SilaarFR: my guild is thriving, i don't know what you're talking about
[2:52:19] xExerion: 10 mans are so piss easy it literally doesnt matter if u cant fit an ideal comp anyway. but there will always be meta cucks i guess.
[2:52:21] Tafson: I dont raid with my guild because I can insta-find a pug any day, and not worry about clc
[2:52:29] boomstick093: Mage boost is bad for the game. Calling gdkp bad is monka
[2:52:30] gdkpgold: cause its ms os most people want sr at this point
[2:52:40] xSagale: TBC did good with badges. Even though you didn't need much gear you still had an incentive to join
[2:52:40] Peilo241: our guild is running like 8 raid groups
[2:52:42] teriboi: any thoughts on holy palas?
[2:52:48] saund: yeah the effort guild masters put in wont be appreciated by most people cause its unecessary atm
[2:52:50] thegummibearmassacre: GDKPs DOCBOZO
[2:52:54] milkiiya: 10men everyone wins, only guild master headaches. vice versa
[2:52:54] painkillab: very hard
[2:52:56] realviewer1235: gdkp buyers Ridicule
[2:53:00] Dutch_Freddy: at this stage the best loot system is 1x SR +1.
[2:53:02] sykey7: they dont want to have such big raids at low level
[2:53:03] basedguy123_: cleek
[2:53:05] xExerion: kleeks
[2:53:07] Atruis_: cleek
[2:53:10] hapjaa: this priest is such a bozo ICANT
[2:53:11] 0xm0_hk: KEKFlute
[2:53:13] batu_x96: 1x SR MS>OS
[2:53:16] gdkpgold: banned
[2:53:20] GavriilArchAngel: hentai guild
[2:53:22] Tafson: @Dutch_Freddy The best loot system is make the raid yourself, pug it, and dont invite anybody who wears your gear type.
[2:53:22] chr47: with 10 man, you just never want to bring certain specs
[2:53:29] Fissed: gdkp is p2w, you leave p2w and people will p2w, same with mage boosting

[2:54:07] michael_greece: do we know the exp from bfd?
[2:54:09] nelsonshorty: no
[2:54:10] DeadnessTV: do a bfd on launch to get xp
[2:54:12] xSagale: if they do a full version of WOW2 then a lvl up raid will make sense and 10 man makes more sense aswell
[2:54:13] Spanos_: even 15 would have been ok
[2:54:15] lofvet: I think they call it level up raid because when level 60 is released, these raids will be available to level in
[2:54:16] gdkpgold: @Fissed having 2 accounts pay 2 win but no one cares
[2:54:17] SilaarFR: 10 man is perfectly fine, guilds (if managed like normal humans) works just fine
[2:54:22] johnnyhopkinwead1: 20 man is nice
[2:54:26] Rabbe_GG: 20 or 25 is cool but 40 idk
[2:54:29] painkillab: New 60 raids
[2:54:32] cookieforu: 10 man is kinda ass for speedrunning, the comp is so limited
[2:54:36] Darksparkh: blizzard plans ICANT
[2:54:37] johnnyhopkinwead1: should just do 10 and 20 mans
[2:54:42] Vibe__E: 8 man is best
[2:54:42] zacke10: Why hating on 10-man? For my small guild its amazing
[2:54:51] johnnyhopkinwead1: nah fuck 40 man
[2:54:53] Charlemagne_66: It's gonna be wo weird going from 10m to 40 man
[2:54:54] milkiiya: i like 10... i get all the items even not logging in all the time... KWEK
[2:54:54] gdkpgold: Ban restedxdd its p2w
[2:54:54] D3KHAR: 5 man molten core is best xddPls
[2:54:59] johnnyhopkinwead1: FUCK 40 MAN
[2:55:04] Hyper_Dan: hire an HR manager for finding guildmates, hire a logistics manager maintaining guild inventory, consumes etc. and hire a raid manager that organises the raids and the losts then maybe a personal assistant so you can focus playing the game EZ
[2:55:05] Tafson: If there is no new end-raid like 70% of the player base is gonna quit after KZ Crypts
[2:55:07] caveman_ju: SM 40 man
[2:55:08] Egis4: they could still do 20man for lv50 bracket
[2:55:09] metalism: I think they're trying to please both sides
[2:55:23] pharsche: imagine 60 man raid
[2:55:27] boomstick093: We never want 40 man
[2:55:28] sykey7: because its at lvl 25 , 40.  lol
[2:55:29] dazdota: Dw we will be able to 20 man 40 man's with the powercreep we are getting.
[2:55:29] AllOfKingsPotato: there 30 man playing in total
[2:55:30] kushkitty99: nobody said era raids will be endgame here
[2:55:30] zacke10: Fuck 40-man alltogether
[2:55:32] nelsonshorty: bro this is not the last phase before 40man
[2:55:34] Dreamlights: 10 man nax Pog
[2:55:34] grimnrsix: holy shit quinXD
[2:55:36] batu_x96: fuck 40 man dude
[2:55:37] Metz47: 20 or 25 is the perfect size kek
[2:55:38] hapjaa: quinXD
[2:55:41] kalsizzle2: 40man is amazing sorry not sorry
[2:55:42] Atruis_: 25 man would be fine
[2:55:51] berriivr: 25 man MC would be sick
[2:55:51] kalleballe105: Flexible raid Pog
[2:55:53] MrBulkzilla: What do you think about Flex raiding instead of 10/25/40 @JokerdTV ?
[2:56:00] batu_x96: u like 5 hour raid?
[2:56:03] dazdota: They said they want to focus on new content is why they are not changing 40 mans
[2:56:04] metalism: I guess designing a new 40 man raid (kara crypts) might be a bit hectic/hard
[2:56:04] easterr__: yeah gonna be annoying af going from 10 to 40. most people are guildless atm and just pug.
[2:56:05] zacke10: These are "Level up raids" so thats why they are doing 10-man
[2:56:06] pilgrimm3n: 30 man inc
[2:56:06] AaQby: StonksDown
[2:56:15] easterr__: even 10 to 25 is a jump as well
[2:56:15] totholio: @Strawberriivr why sick it got the flu?
[2:56:18] batu_x96: i like 31 man
[2:56:18] boomstick093: 40 man is stupid. It kills the game
[2:56:24] Charlemagne_66: My guild would have to recruit 20 more people
[2:56:28] drgeemo: yapping

[2:56:53] Dreamlights: real voice KEKW
[2:56:53] IllusoryResponse: YEP
[2:56:53] Fissed: thing is, gdkp and mage boosting both give buyers something to buy gold for, so long as people buy gold the more botters there is, the more botters there is the more "normal" gamers suffer cos economy is fucked
[2:56:57] Slyxen: you sound just like another streamer i watch
[2:57:01] realviewer1235: 🌳 day
[2:57:02] painkillab: jokrdChad
[2:57:08] farenbal: So they are crying about loot and you are crying about them KEKW
[2:57:10] ownsoft: theres nothing funnier than trying to gather 40 boomers for 6 hours, you are right
[2:57:10] milkiiya: i agree the bfd loot is very very easy
[2:57:11] zacke10: WoW players have always been whining about loot. It is not like this is something new LUL
[2:57:13] magentas: HUHA soft
[2:57:13] Zeldrain: @Slyxen payo?
[2:57:14] Denz0TV: All of those casual boomer soy boys need to get beat up. Ruining the game
[2:57:14] Tafson: @JokerdTV Thats also another reason you dont need a guild. Loot is plentiful
[2:57:17] YzieGG: they come from retail and miss the epics for login ICANT
[2:57:19] Charlemagne_66: And same number of items dropping

[2:57:46] Atruis_: 7 day lockout for the first 2 weeks of p2
[2:57:50] gxniusx: fors'd
[2:57:54] Tafson: 60 man Pog
[2:57:56] BigJohnnyLove: ok
[2:58:01] Slyxen: @Zeldrain no
[2:58:01] Nerddcore: nothing better than not getting any gear for a while and then you finally get it, best feeling ever
[2:58:05] Tafson: 80 man raid 3 day lockout Pog Prayge
[2:58:06] trailerandy: yap
[2:58:06] kalleballe105: I think they are making the game more pug friendly
[2:58:11] dazdota: LOL low iq take I have raided every lockout on my leather chars and only have one set piece on each. Its just RNG. I was bis week 2 OF WRATH phase 1
[2:58:11] Cypfer: make it reset every day in p2
[2:58:15] EldarionDK: They have to buff 40man raids if everyone is doing 4 times the dmg too. so doing 25 or 30man for normal 40mans might make sense
[2:58:16] chr47: 3 day lockout + 10 man is terrible for guilds
[2:58:19] Fabzerxff: xdd
[2:58:21] painkillab: Way tol ez
[2:58:22] muztho: yap
[2:58:30] real_spin: @JokerdTV maybe they will add 2 raids in p3 one being 20/25 man raid and other being 10man
[2:58:33] nelsonshorty: BRO ITS PHASE 2 WTF
[2:58:39] realviewer1235: YEP
[2:58:43] Charlemagne_66: They should get rid of the shit items no one will use but decrease loot dropping to 1 item per boss
[2:58:47] Torsoto: yap king
[2:58:52] milkiiya: everyone on sod wears the same and looks the same now
[2:58:52] Frap26: just roll 100 everytime ez
[2:58:55] Hyper_Dan: UltraMad no changes UltraMad also I want loot
[2:58:59] Tafson: This whole version of the game is meant to cater to people who were not able to achieve what they wanted out of the game in every prior version. They want everybody to feel like they're "BiS"
[2:59:07] Kew1n89: yappi yappi yap
[2:59:08] kaod92: I think that's ok though, whi actually WANTS to log in 1 time a week
[2:59:19] Fabzerxff: yapgod
[2:59:22] saund: your bed is on fire!!!! @JokerdTV
[2:59:23] bobertoh: yap does it ever end?
[2:59:25] SilaarFR: If 3 days lockout with 10-man raid is a problem for your guild, then the problem is your guild
[2:59:26] Kew1n89: #Yapgod
[2:59:28] ShingaTV: half will be removed anyway feels like
[2:59:32] drgeemo: Dude stop the yap

[2:59:48] gxniusx: wowhobbs PogT
[2:59:54] AsusCom: @JokerdTV they updating items even from from SM so I thin kthey will upgrade items from this raids too
[2:59:56] real_spin: I used that back in 2019 KEKW
[2:59:59] alessandro_el_aspersor: that thing need 50 stam and 20 def and its good
[3:00:00] anzeb: wow hobbs, blast from the past
[3:00:00] gxniusx: That is just DE stuff
[3:00:09] Tafson: True if they're updating SM, they will update the endgame raids too
[3:00:10] thegummibearmassacre: modCheck
[3:00:14] Tafson: It will be ridiculous not to
[3:00:14] Dutch_Freddy: all epics they can change, we have no clue about the last level 60 items yet cause they are still drawing them
[3:00:18] Counter_99: bro its phase 2
[3:00:19] ShingaTV: atleast in low lvl whats understandable
[3:00:23] Tschabrak: 10 man ist just for levle up dungeons i guess @JokerdTV
[3:00:24] cocococomango: @JokerdTV its almost like devs can have a different opinion :O
[3:00:27] dazdota: They are not pro "40 man". They said they just dont have time to change 40 MANS becuase they want to focus on making new content.
[3:00:27] ShingaTV: if they go on 50 atleast for 20 and at 60 on 40 its fine
[3:00:27] 冂凵乃口: vendorstrike will be melle hunter meta weapon PogT
[3:00:28] Vecth: did you really want to be doing a 40 man raid at level 25?
[3:00:35] thegummibearmassacre: GDKPs SkeletonBOZO
[3:00:39] Fabzerxff: yap ResidentSleeper
[3:00:43] Torsoto: GDKPs SkeletonBOZO
[3:00:46] YzieGG: they can just release ZG at 60 or  a new 20 men raid
[3:00:47] chapochapo3: 40 man raid for bfd doesnt make sense - imagine forming a group post 25
[3:00:58] My_keI: will hunters be forced to play MM for TSA to get a raid spot if not in a guild? @JokerdTV 󠀀
[3:01:03] Torsoto: 20-25 at 50 would be nice
[3:01:08] Fissed: you are still better going with a guild cos you will go in with the same people, if 1 person gets your helm, then thats 1 less person you are competing against. If you pug, you might alwways go with someone who needs that helm
[3:01:09] CoolTV: @JokerdTV 20man would have been amazing
[3:01:11] Dutch_Freddy: maybe they make a 'new' weapon called Moltenmourn! Kappa
[3:01:14] Atruis_: 25 man kara crypss raid possibly?
[3:01:15] Tafson: We have a roster for GDKP's still going to run in Phase 2. If you have 10 people who arent rats, you can still do it.
[3:01:21] dazdota: SOD is a beta TEST for future Classic + if u dont realise that yet ICANT
[3:01:22] D3KHAR: 25 man SM
[3:01:24] bjornicek: Whats gona be better ret or feral?
[3:01:28] EmfxGaming: At least they're using leveling as an opportunity to gauge raid engagement numbers as we progress through
[3:01:32] boomstick093: I love 10 man, cause i like playing more then 1 char. Its so fun right now the way the made it :) Makes its easier for me to enjoy the game, since there is the normal work days aswell
[3:01:34] easterr__: there is no shot they do 40 mans at 60. esp with 40 cap being 10
[3:01:38] Hyper_Dan: widePogT1 1 man raiding widePogT2
[3:01:40] anzeb: you gotta understand that there  are some size limitations to dungeons
[3:01:41] brakkas: Gnomeregan 10man and one-boss raid (like Onyxia) 20 man would be nice
[3:01:42] YzieGG: I think they make it 10 men for later so u can 5 men it
[3:01:43] zacke10: Imagine 20 man in Gnomereagan. Its way to small
[3:01:46] AllSublime: They will not do 25 man
[3:01:46] ShingaTV: @bjornicek the one you press your buttons better D:
[3:01:47] Czompi__: Makie it 20man, then next phase nerd it to 10man so you can use it as a level up raid
[3:01:47] anzeb: lets says imagine 20 or 25 people in gnomer
[3:01:48] kushkitty99: nobidy said classic raids will be end game
[3:01:49] anzeb: its too smal
[3:01:50] Fenriz25: they can also increase the amount of loot like in SOM
[3:01:55] anzeb: or 25 in SM KEKW
[3:01:56] easterr__: people will still be guildless puggers. they don’t want guys scrambling to get a guild
[3:02:01] 0xm0_hk: 100man raid PogT
[3:02:03] Torsoto: 25 in SM would be bad
[3:02:07] bjornicek: @shingatv idk what  to choise  and I dont want have 2 char hh
[3:02:11] AllSublime: 10/20/40 are the possible raid sizes. It maps too well
[3:02:16] xsekox666x: Ofc less. Karazahn Was perfect @jokerdtv
[3:02:19] Dsniper11A: 20-25 is best imo
[3:02:19] boomstick093: To be fair. Do we really want sod to be like classic once more ? We allrdy did that al ot off times. Is getting borring. If you wanna do that content. Go classic servers and have fun :)
[3:02:22] milkiiya: instead of 20 or 40.. blizzard go 5 next
[3:02:27] Avian141: i mean what if we get so strong we can just do the 40 man raid with only 20man? @JokerdTV
[3:02:28] Dutch_Freddy: the way we are guessing for what can still come in future content means we can expect anything still from Blizzard in SoD  ^^
[3:02:33] Vecth: They should just make all of classic flex raiding
[3:02:37] ShingaTV: @bjornicek y its hard :D lot of cool new stuff to play
[3:02:38] Laitho_90: they should make 1 80 man raid
[3:03:05] fiskensfriend: @JokerdTV MC split runs with guild?
[3:03:10] Suinchi: Retail Andys hate 40 man "aww my item drop but i didnt get it....40 man should drop more loot"
[3:03:18] bjornicek: @shingatv on ret I like cause 2h its so good
[3:03:19] fiskensfriend: @JokerdTV 20 mains 20 alts split runs?
[3:03:20] guntersen: mara stream today ?
[3:03:31] Dutch_Freddy: Trial of the Grand Crusade was super poor loot system
[3:03:49] Wullull: sod is wotlk with a vanilla skin

[3:04:13] Spanos_: ICC has the worst tier system
[3:04:14] Teazir27: @suinchi classic raid is for loot you dont play it for thé mechanics
