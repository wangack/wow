[3:34:50] EliBourne: Ill be running around as prot lol
[3:34:53] Wastingmoney: pala/dk bis

[3:35:03] Rabc83: he needs to know :P
[3:35:16] jovin7: haha dont take it down <3
[3:35:27] Scope92: Full ap prot?
[3:35:40] ugubugu_: that was legendary
[3:35:43] EliBourne: Fury was really bad in the beginning
[3:35:43] NodikaTheDrood: I dont think they would
[3:35:53] Astrosparkle: That build likely won't be possible early on. Melee tend to be medicore until the ICC tier.
[3:35:57] Nosfemon: swifty we need new swiftys videos from classic era with insane edits with pendulum soundtrack :D
[3:36:02] soeholttt: Hello, how are you
[3:36:12] fantastiq25: damm
[3:36:22] EliBourne: Defensive stance all the time
[3:36:28] Wastingmoney: does it penetrate armor?
[3:36:44] Sochill_theill: sunwell
[3:36:49] Sepsis11: Sepsis11 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 23 month streak! Yo Swifty!
[3:36:50] StreamElements: Sepsis11 just subscribed for 31 months in a row PogChamp
[3:36:54] NodikaTheDrood: did they have ARP gems I forget
[3:36:55] ScoTty2HottY1337: @Galdrena I am not talking bad, as an artist (which is similar to a performer), talking about a personal life experience is constructive criticism. That does not violate Twitch TOS. I've read "defamation" clauses."
[3:37:05] kyorra1994: so in the nex expansion no gear can be upgraded right?????
[3:37:10] CubanCoffee__: my hunter had 104% arp it was a good time.
[3:37:26] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:37:28] Astrosparkle: The early Wrath seasons will be much different then when it was current content. DK's for example were busted the first few seasons but we likely play on the talent and balance patch that was in ICC similar to classic and TBC.
[3:37:38] ScoTty2HottY1337: I should be able to speak about my own experiences freely here.
[3:37:40] soeholttt: I know one guy used to wear full t6 gear with bulwark and main and main glavie and he owned lvl 80 as a 79 swifty.
[3:37:55] Wastingmoney: @Astrosparkle already confirmed we play 3.3.5
[3:38:00] nayden69: pretty sure 100% is cap @CubanCoffee__
[3:38:05] ElliotOffen: i killed a mage with frost armor up from 100%HP in one global earlier today with WF/sword spec crit using catas edge, was bizarre lol
[3:38:06] jelly_button_lint: you made him look so bad Infront of his friend.
[3:38:07] CubanCoffee__: 104% was all the way into icc, took a while.
[3:38:14] EliBourne: There is no freedom of speech here
[3:38:34] palac105: The nostalgia must be overwhelming, theorycrafting ARP while also being a member of AARP
[3:38:39] CubanCoffee__: @nayden69 104. something was the cap. nearly 100% sure
[3:38:39] Wastingmoney: ofc, armor cant go negative, so you only can penetrate 100% ofc
[3:38:44] Nosfemon: swifty we need new swiftys videos from classic era with insane edits with pendulum soundtrack :D
