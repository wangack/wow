[3:01:09] seriousface32: Can't he just be expecting the embrace and tries to pre knock it? I meen I've seen some crazy plays before but I guess Jaime is one of the best for a reason?
[3:01:09] dusttiy: HAHAAHAHA
[3:01:09] hollingx: the verdant embrace healed in the 2nd clip so it doesn't matter lol

[3:01:21] kebablover55555: i dont believe that spells on gcd( incl thunderstorm) are worth cheating. Only good cheats are to use spells of gcd
[3:01:21] iamreallyafan: guys have you seen the kids playing fortnite?????
[3:01:22] Tugaiam: I don't know if he's innocent or not, but it's always much easier to accuse, or follow a negative trend.
[3:01:24] tavdad: LULW
[3:01:28] ebrithil357: If I were accused i would stream my pov
[3:01:29] Stolpebar: @absterge Relaaaaaaaaxx my guy!
[3:01:30] Nazrins: @Vilaye +1
[3:01:30] dooshken: Surely that's the case Kappa
[3:01:33] crawnpocktail: nah the worst thing he could do would be to stream if he's cheating
[3:01:33] infernion: @Jaime Thoughts on your own ex teammates saying you cheat, and your current teammate Luuxia reporting you to Blizzard 100x last season + saying on stream constantly you're the biggest cheater?
[3:01:34] yindraga: OFC he is cheating if not he would stream and had nothing to hide. Simple
[3:01:34] GnarstyTV: @absterge youre too handsome to be this sassy King
[3:01:37] Ephixza: Jaime is legit and he does not cheat, i remember he told baba i dont do mistakes.

[3:02:15] healmeshammy: lol
[3:02:17] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz when you showed the jaime POV why is the keypress of the lava, shock etc showing on bars, but pressing knock is only showing  tGCD ?
[3:02:17] boblord: that is the least suspicious clip
[3:02:18] notMyk: everyone does this? Kappa
[3:02:18] keeeptryin: 3 instances now

[3:04:44] Xottv: Jaime, is a dedicated Elemental main, who invests a considerable time in his gameplay. With Elemental's rotation being at the easiest it has ever been, it requires minimal cognitive effort from him.  So of course he finds himself with ample opportunity to delve into finer intricacies and nuances of his gameplay.

[3:05:16] Schnitzelmaker007: Lmaooo
[3:05:18] Jkrx: the leap was obvious but the timing is insane considering he was already jumping around before leaping monkaW
[3:05:19] adrianly051: @dusttiy HAHAHA
[3:05:20] WagwanBombaClatBomba: BOYZ
[3:05:20] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz obviously if he cheated he wouldnt call it that fast
[3:05:20] wogxwog: Maybe Jamie IS Thrall and the elements guide him!
[3:05:21] SaltyBites: I legit dont get how is perfectly guessing where a link will be and killing it frame 1 is ok but this is not?
[3:05:21] karijes4: This happens few times per game
[3:05:22] Izostarx: kinda rng tho
[3:05:22] notMyk: LOOKS LEGIT GUYS
[3:05:23] lyricx211: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiGgpiSsqL0
[3:05:23] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz when you showed the jaime POV why is the keypress of the lava, shock etc showing on bars, but pressing knock is only showing in tGCD ?
[3:05:23] H3ggaa1: to many "crazy clips"
[3:05:24] dusttiy: @adrianly051 HAHAHAHAHAHAH
[3:05:24] kotlinktt: ahahahahah

[3:05:27] Raekthechef: I missed what happened this clip cuz ad Sadge
[3:05:27] ebrithil357: he doesnt knock on the jump, its the second he presses charge
[3:05:28] Vilaye: i mean tbh its a pre incap with opression roar on him. its an obvious swap
[3:05:32] kotlinktt: xddddddddddddddddddddd
[3:05:32] Mipsenx: someone make yoing sub sound
[3:05:35] iiEnvy: replay it, i had an ad @Whaazz
[3:05:37] kotlinktt: holy fk
[3:05:38] pmakewow: JAIME 1 - BEST MECHANICAL PLAYER WORLD
[3:05:38] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz HE CALLED IT
[3:05:45] Agrero7: true @Vilaye
[3:05:45] grris: just insane how he plays for 12 years and one day wakes up and has insane mechanics
[3:05:47] bossjeezy: what is he saying during the knock?
[3:05:49] Cybernytez: WE ALL WANNA KNOW
[3:05:50] karijes4: @Vilaye Timing those knocks 0.0001 over and over is impossible.
[3:05:53] infernion: @Vilaye Explain 99% kickrate for 8 months
[3:05:55] Agrero7: but its a obvious swap
[3:05:55] Ephixza: but if you play ele for such a long time, its normal to do these kind of stuff.
[3:05:56] bigdamslam: he just needs to stream with a camera on his keyboard and mouse
[3:05:57] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz if he was cheating he wouldnt call it so fast
[3:05:58] jaime: check cord
[3:05:58] bigdamslam: easy
[3:06:00] bokioz: can you google and try to see which wow bots there is on the market
[3:06:01] hahohihu: i mean, that is expected from a really good player
[3:06:01] lyricx211: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiGgpiSsqL0
[3:06:02] eEpzi: jaime needs to start streaming or nobody will believe him
[3:06:06] eEpzi: ever
[3:06:06] tfisher8: wizk got lucky af (i mean that with love) getting that totem. every other game the totem healed, like it was intensely done and lucky.
[3:06:07] ardalolthe: okay whaazz about the knocks, but what about kicks?
[3:06:07] sampicaute: The timing is the problem
[3:06:09] WagwanBombaClatBomba: TO MANY ACCIDENTS BOYZ MrDestructoid
[3:06:11] drutrop: honstly i Think hes just an insane knocker, and know the value, so hes always thinking forward
[3:06:11] Schnitzelmaker007: @whaazz check dc
[3:06:12] Krozzyfix: @infernion good ping?
[3:06:13] linuswarlock: @Vilaye people shoudnt miss kicks obviously KEKW
[3:06:13] kotlinktt: @jaime bro how you puch that feral xdd
[3:06:19] Runek27: If you use your brain you can do that, and actually think about what is going on
[3:06:20] absterge: how come all of this started happening after 12 years of playing arena? only in Dragonflight? maybe this is just lots of practice!! you don’t become the goat without practice! (or bots)
[3:06:21] kelqoo: either stream and prove everyone wrong or just take the heat like a man
[3:06:25] jimhasnotekkers: @absterge even if that does exist it’s probably people misunderstanding the catharsis ground interaction for the most part. They’ve not fixed that yet.
[3:06:26] swaf44: the kicks are the only sus thing imo ) rest is memes
[3:06:29] Vilaye: im not defending him. if this happens 1000x times then its fishy, but the last 3 clips i saw are not too bad
[3:06:33] sinisthere: xD
[3:06:34] tebz: i've played w jaime for 7+ years and i can say with certainty he is not cheating
[3:06:34] Vilaye: and dunno about the kicks either
[3:06:36] Joke_Fistweaver: he has pre oppressive roar on the druid
[3:06:41] Sibble7: Yeah i mean the kicks are even more sus than the knocks.  you are telling me he ALWAYS succesfully kicks
[3:06:41] Vilaye: dont spam me with hate messages guys relax HAHAHA
[3:06:44] Joke_Fistweaver: seems like they wanna go him right?
[3:06:46] SaltyBites: how many zeros?
[3:06:48] WagwanBombaClatBomba: OFCOURSE WE HAVE EXPLONATOINS
[3:06:48] revejeger: who is knocking
[3:06:50] WagwanBombaClatBomba: jazggzOMEGAKEK
[3:06:52] Schnitzelmaker007: @absterge jaime went to hit the time chamber like goku did
[3:06:55] ayyyrod: sterge day drinking; but i got him to @ me wettttt ty to the goat rsham
[3:06:56] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz he called it too in coms
[3:06:57] bartek8003: hes just from the future so he knows whats gonna happen before it happen for us
[3:06:57] dizze1988: but he dont say hes ready or something. only some sec after
[3:07:03] iiEnvy: i dont even klnow what happened lol
[3:07:05] yoogyrdru: 2k
[3:07:07] Frkntv: i mean the feral fake jumps the wildcharge but jaime knocks 0.1 on the ability
[3:07:08] infernion: Funniest thing is he almost sounds surprised he knocked the leap
[3:07:10] Frkntv: like
[3:07:10] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[3:07:13] yoogyrdru: 2k is this awc finnals
[3:07:16] SaltyBites: not crazier than guessing where a link will be and killing frame 1
[3:07:18] slapzzdruid: hahahah
[3:07:21] WagwanBombaClatBomba: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[3:07:24] iRarityz: notice how he says it after he does it
[3:07:24] tfisher8: i mean the feral could of got rop'd with how far he was
[3:07:25] keeeptryin: oh hell nah 💀
[3:07:26] djdeath1213: this poor feral LUL
[3:07:27] shredder1111: he's bullying these cats more than allinity ever did
[3:07:28] hahohihu: Should we report every death on blind as well?
[3:07:28] iRarityz: its never planned
[3:07:29] Esotraz: that 1 is not as fast tho
[3:07:29] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz he knocked before too
[3:07:30] kotlinktt: xdddd
[3:07:31] Sibble7: Can we check his targeting?
[3:07:32] azulboom: nah bro this ones not even that crazy
[3:07:33] Fynlol: poor cats bro KEKW
[3:07:36] WagwanBombaClatBomba: THIS FERAL GETTING BULLIED
[3:07:36] Sibble7: He is changing target mid air?
[3:07:37] biamak: that one is slow
[3:07:37] aremyys: totally viable beeing a good player like he is
[3:07:38] voygard: looks like a mario game from 2010 KEKW
[3:07:38] Runek27: He is in the air for 1 second already
[3:07:39] sampicaute: this one seems legit idk
[3:07:39] WagwanBombaClatBomba: POOR GUY
[3:07:39] Ixxmre: he says after he did ot
[3:07:40] infernion: Look how fast the knock happens after the concussive debuff on the healer
[3:07:40] sistahfistah1: this one isnt instant
[3:07:41] azulboom: its omega slolw
[3:07:41] slexulol: this one is okay
[3:07:42] Schnitzelmaker007: That one is pretty normal
[3:07:49] bokioz: if he is cheating why is he not winning tournaments
[3:07:50] Raekthechef: @dadudadu I mean probably just code it to press it when X class presses X button
[3:07:51] tortops: i so obvius thats a script or something...insta tringger
[3:07:52] Froffsy: jaime plays wow all day for like 10 years ofc ur gna knock some shit and make some random plays sometimes
[3:07:52] dizze1988: just wierd hes only saying hes doing it after 1-2 sec after. And not hes ready
[3:07:53] OptiTV_: real question about jamie gameplay is.. would he 1v1 cervantes?
[3:07:54] WagwanBombaClatBomba: HAHAHAHAHAAHAHA
[3:07:56] Blumee9: If he cheats, should he not auto knock EVERY leap?
[3:07:57] Melbylive: hahahaha
[3:07:57] Flypsz: 100% cheating lol
[3:08:02] absterge: *gets linked 30 diff clips of insta knocks* … “Alright guys listen, this may look sus but it’s easy to do this”
[3:08:05] iamreallyafan: guys… he’s just looking for the «jumps because then its when dmg is commming
[3:08:08] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Whaazz and enter code: ECHO

[3:08:27] dooshken: @absterge Surely
[3:08:28] Pinaclonada: why does he say he knocked after it happens and doesnt say that hes gonna knock tho
[3:08:28] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @absterge it was accident bro Kappa
[3:08:28] grris: COPE
[3:08:28] absterge: oh yes okay
[3:08:29] ardalolthe: @Whaazz what about the time raiku complained he gets kicked 10% 30% 50% 75% 99%
[3:08:30] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz open the video from his POV you got in discord and tell me why keypresses on dmg abilities are shown on action bars but knock key presses on knocks are only in tGCD
[3:08:30] absterge: HAHAHAHA
[3:08:31] Aalty: while doing perfect dps rotation
[3:08:32] buttermytoastt: bruh I can’t watch a fucking clip without an ad popping up

[3:08:46] Nazrins: i wouldnt say this is perfect dps rotation this game..
[3:08:47] Esotraz: HEARSAY
[3:08:48] kotlinktt: NO another video feral was in range already
[3:08:50] kelqoo: if he always max ranges then how come the dragon knocks he is on top of the dragons
[3:08:50] keeeptryin: i fucking love whazz KEKW
[3:08:51] muneplays: its kinda the same when you spam kick behind a pillar when youre hoping for a shimmer poly coming in
[3:09:01] Nazrins: we have seen better..
[3:09:03] wogxwog: @absterge coach me the ways of Rshaman please 🙏
[3:09:04] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz open the video from his POV you got in discord and tell me why keypresses on dmg abilities are shown on action bars but knock key presses on knocks are only in tGCD
[3:09:05] sampicaute: What about the 99% Kick rate ?
[3:09:07] xesatahuh: why are ppl talking about kicks when we are watching knocks
[3:09:08] jaime: thats really fucked up nasse..
[3:09:09] Schnitzelmaker007: Whazz come on man, be real

[3:09:38] WEAKNESS1988: kingslayer, oathbreaker, the man without honor
[3:09:39] TheSpyrono: Jaime doesn't cheat everyone is just jealous
[3:09:43] absterge: honesty this just proves wow is a dogshit game because jaime (the god) with 100% kick rates and insta knocks still can’t make top 8 in AWC :(
[3:09:44] ebrithil357: yeah he just needs to be proactive about clearing his name
