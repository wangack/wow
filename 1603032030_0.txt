[0:46:52] Smith6612: You know what I can't stop thinking about when it comes to Blizzard games? The use of magic where magic doesn't seem fit. Like Mercy in Overwatch saying, she casts a spell upon people as she heals them... with a medic gun.
[0:47:30] billyasznee: Hi Jake, in wich county are you atm?
[0:47:33] grouptherapyyy: are u speaking to water frequently?

[0:49:14] grouptherapyyy: well my b I struggled in long distance b4 was just tryna see how its done..
[0:49:23] Smith6612: Ah. I used to get all sorts of lag on BattleNet games around the time WoW Classic and Overwatch dropped.
[0:49:30] jcards: is this worth doing if you don't have good gear
[0:49:31] Smith6612: But I think Blizzard was dealing with DoS attacks too.
[0:49:56] Smith6612: I'd just play the game but watch the packet loss and desync icons flash
[0:51:05] asez: playing WoW Kappa

[3:21:13] xaekovx: wrath balanced so well
[3:21:21] schut4ever: shaman is quite low on the chars in all aspects
[3:21:27] Smith6612: Needs some Kool-Aid
[3:22:01] xaekovx: heroism carries that class
[3:22:07] xaekovx: it's disgusting
[3:22:28] xaekovx: no one should have a move like heroism
[3:22:34] laincyborg: what game is this i wanna get into wow but i want to know which one i should get
[3:22:45] laincyborg: waw*
[3:22:47] xaekovx: it's wrath classic

[3:26:19] xaekovx: not many abilities man
[3:26:24] xaekovx: that's why wrath is good
[3:26:30] xaekovx: retail has too many abilities
[3:26:36] xaekovx: can't even die if you try
[3:26:39] laincyborg: what are those things in the hud?
[3:26:47] schut4ever: Wotlk runs on any laptop, so its a good game for on the road imo
[3:26:52] xaekovx: he has a lot of add-ons going on
[3:26:58] laincyborg: ohh i see
[3:27:35] xaekovx: wrath lags on my laptop it's the same laptop I played on back then I broke too many computers
[3:27:58] xaekovx: laptops just don't have the video card for a 2004 game man
[3:28:20] xMika1: yea normal office laptops dont but gaming ones do
[3:28:21] schut4ever: I managed to run it on a pc setup as a server and stream it aswell
[3:28:40] xaekovx: I was thinking about an external video card for my laptop
[3:28:43] schut4ever: so I could play it on any device that supported streaming games
[3:28:44] xaekovx: is that possible
[3:29:06] xMika1: @xaekovx never heard about that
[3:29:12] xMika1: MrDestructoid
[3:29:16] xaekovx: I think you can HDMI a vid card
[3:29:21] MainlyHigh: you not like shockwave?
[3:29:34] xaekovx: external hard drives exist
[3:29:41] xaekovx: why wouldn't a video card
[3:29:50] xMika1: yea but never ehard of external graphic cards
[3:30:18] xaekovx: so how do you pump you laptop up if you can't just plug it jn
[3:30:47] xMika1: @watsup WAKE UP DinkDonk

[3:31:21] ZonicS28: !Plan
[3:31:21] StreamElements: https://clips.twitch.tv/PlumpPoorNewtFeelsBadMan-DV2WtDMz4-p6Ky6x
[3:31:27] Smith6612: If you're gaming on onboard video, memory speed does matter BTW.
[3:31:36] Smith6612: Make sure your member is matched, so it can run in dual channel. Faster the better.
[3:31:41] xMika1: @Smith6612 jnbL
[3:31:45] Smith6612: The rest of it comes to cooling/power delivery.
[3:31:48] xMika1: 500 word essay incoming

[3:32:39] donat_jo: @xmika1 hey jnbL
[3:32:40] xaekovx: I think you're right about the cooling on the laptop
[3:32:46] xMika1: @donat_jo jnbL
[3:32:52] Smith6612: Most laptops have pretty poor cooling FWIW
[3:32:58] xMika1: ^
[3:33:22] xMika1: my gaming laptop i use for travel is always at 95 degrees C
[3:33:22] Timzuku: HeyGuys
[3:33:30] Smith6612: Any MacBook made prior to the M1, most "everyday" laptops. Gaming laptops are usually reasonable, but modern AMD systems tend to fare better than modern Intel systems there.
[3:34:01] watsupyouguys: @xMika1 Stare

[3:35:05] laincyborg: how many bosses are there
[3:35:07] Smith6612: Eh if you're gonna game on an onboard GPU, AMDs tend to fare better than Intels. AMD's usually suck for video work compared to Intel, though.
[3:35:10] xMika1: whos @watsup then
[3:35:15] xMika1: Hmmm

[3:43:18] Smith6612: Only Blizzard games I've played are the Starcraft series and Overwatch
[3:43:20] schut4ever: Botanica is mindnumblingy boring tho
[3:43:38] donat_jo: Is lvl80 possible in this one stream? Or lvl78 at least?
[3:44:18] laincyborg: can you beat this game?
[3:44:18] Smith6612: I didn't get into WoW mostly because, at the time, I didn't like paying subscriptions to play online (WoW), and preferred a more tight knit community formed by clans running their own servers.
[3:44:19] StarwalkerZah: i had this weird experience last night watching asian boss talking to koreans, Korean language is sick
[3:44:37] StarwalkerZah: i couldnt get over how much i like the korean language now
[3:44:56] Smith6612: The Korean language is pretty easy to learn. Very modern.
[3:45:22] schut4ever: Getting all achievements is sort like beating the game
