[0:58:29] limp0h: xD
[0:59:16] PremiuM15: is the delivery free bcs of happy ending or how does that payment work
[0:59:18] deftmode: If some guy/girl is really cool with the delivery, does something standout, it's a 10% tip, even in europe for me.
[0:59:18] MonzonWasTaken: food delivery is a bunch of grey so its hard to say what exactly youre paying for
[0:59:34] MonzonWasTaken: but at restaurants youre paying for the food, you tip for the service
[0:59:52] limp0h: @MonzonWasTaken not in eu
[1:00:14] SKNARFN: lmgd yells at the wait staff
[1:00:32] MonzonWasTaken: how much do the servers get paid in eu
[1:00:39] MonzonWasTaken: cause in most states in us its $2
[1:00:45] deftmode: Yeah why is that the standard tho? Do it a bit different and make it a positive thing for them :)
[1:00:49] gdkpgold: there are especially during stv event hyperspawn
[1:00:53] limp0h: @MonzonWasTaken in swe, its $13/h - minimum
[1:01:03] deftmode: It's always so little to you buying, and a lot to them - just saying.
[1:01:42] MonzonWasTaken: well in cali its $15 and youre still expected to tip
[1:01:47] MonzonWasTaken: so no excuse KEKW
[1:03:07] MonzonWasTaken: you can its just frowned upon
[1:03:15] watanuki_: ahahah

[1:14:40] the__Zoso: gat damn!
[1:14:47] PremiuM15: hourly perma lmgd1Vanish
[1:15:00] MonzonWasTaken: i never said ALL the waiters MUST get paid lol wtf
[1:15:01] gdkpgold: actually u will have 1k viewers cause jokerd playing diablo4 now
[1:15:09] MonzonWasTaken: some waiters dont deserve a tip forsure
[1:15:39] PremiuM15: a streamer got banned for showing how easy it is to viewers
[1:15:47] PremiuM15: to viewbot
[1:16:12] SKNARFN: not true
[1:16:22] gdkpgold: DO Something
[1:16:27] MonzonWasTaken: yea thats not true
[1:16:49] SKNARFN: standard is 15%
[1:16:53] MonzonWasTaken: usually 15%-20
[1:17:09] MonzonWasTaken: yes but its not automatically added
[1:17:41] Sadly92: They split the tips and get paid way less than minimum wage
[1:17:53] gdkpgold: Clowneg  In germany we take our calculator with us to also figure out the tax
[1:17:59] MonzonWasTaken: its kind of like commission
[1:18:00] SKNARFN: nicer restuarants will charge gratuity which is basically tip automatically on bill
[1:18:13] gdkpgold: yes
[1:18:19] MonzonWasTaken: yea but mcds doesnt provide service just food
[1:18:19] SKNARFN: you don’t tip at mcdonalds bozo
[1:18:47] MonzonWasTaken: depends where you kive
[1:18:55] MonzonWasTaken: in la i was making 6 figures
[1:19:00] gdkpgold: I would tip lmgd good cause before he spits on my burger
[1:19:06] MonzonWasTaken: in kentucky i was making 40k when i first started
[1:19:20] MonzonWasTaken: ya
[1:19:21] SKNARFN: $2.13 hr + your tips unless the state forces minimum wage salary on waiting positions
[1:19:47] iNSANEono: box droprate from chests is like from mobs now
[1:19:49] iNSANEono: not 50%
[1:20:07] SKNARFN: a lot of servers are making above national average with less that 40 hours per week.
[1:20:14] gdkpgold: the trolls in the western ruins have usually 2 spawn points
[1:20:49] gdkpgold: *2chests
[1:20:57] SKNARFN: don’t blame us. england was doing it first and we started doing it.
[1:21:33] MonzonWasTaken: but the taxi isnt free is it?
[1:21:47] Sadly92: I doordash and tips are 50% of my income
[1:22:20] MonzonWasTaken: with food delivery you pay for the food, you tip for the person delivering the food, their car, gas, etc
[1:22:37] MonzonWasTaken: and being on time with your shit
[1:22:45] MonzonWasTaken: or faster than normal
[1:23:22] MonzonWasTaken: with the taxi the service IS the product youre already paying for
[1:24:16] iNSANEono: at this point its not even a tip anymore 4Head u just pay owner and delivery guy seperate, but you can legally not pay the delivery guy LULW
[1:25:07] MonzonWasTaken: i didnt hear anything you said btw cause of ads KEKW
[1:25:17] iNSANEono: LULW
[1:25:18] MonzonWasTaken: hmm maybe i should tip with twitch prime
[1:25:32] gdkpgold: pay them less so they have an incentive to deliver faster next time xdd
[1:26:18] dalewotlk: @MonzonWasTaken in Serbia delivery guy isn't even allowed to take a tip ( i wanted to tip him 1 euro) and he said we are not allowed to take it
[1:26:52] teriko_: isnt tip culture just a way to avoid taxes
[1:27:51] MonzonWasTaken: its really all the companies fault, we can probably all agree on that
[1:27:54] Occidi: no one paying a tip on delivery driver in europe, its expected that the company pays the driver a correct salary, its not on the customer to worry about that, if they are not paid enough then they'll strike and not work etc
[1:27:59] MonzonWasTaken: they charge too much for the service
[1:29:31] MonzonWasTaken: yeah from what i can gather eu and us operate completely differently, in us they dont pay drivers a salary
[1:29:37] iNSANEono: dodge bullet
[1:29:38] MonzonWasTaken: their income is mostly from tips
[1:30:06] MonzonWasTaken: no everyone drives
[1:30:10] MonzonWasTaken: we dont taxi
[1:30:11] PremiuM15: everyone tips eachother lmgd1Poor
[1:30:14] Occidi: @MonzonWasTaken by salary i just mean whatever ways they are paid, they are not literally paid by hours or w/e
[1:30:18] gdkpgold: buy doing gdkps irl
[1:30:36] iNSANEono: stop talking
[1:30:47] MonzonWasTaken: bro no one is tipping the taxi man KEKW
[1:30:50] teriko_: :)
[1:31:12] MonzonWasTaken: yes but that shit is like $20 + and almost all of it goes to driver anyways
[1:31:21] MonzonWasTaken: so they are good
[1:31:31] gdkpgold: 0
[1:31:48] gdkpgold: scemm app kek
[1:31:58] iNSANEono: m8
[1:32:02] iNSANEono: chestfarm doesnt work for boxes
[1:32:09] iNSANEono: its same droprate as from mobs now
[1:32:41] iNSANEono: watched xn farm boxes for 2h earlier, got 4 from mobs and 2 from chests
[1:33:17] iNSANEono: ye but not wow
[1:33:38] gdkpgold: theres guarenteed chests near thunderbluff if you just need friendly
[1:33:43] PremiuM15: i watch poki you and breckie hill
[1:34:14] iNSANEono: forsen movies & keyboards
[1:34:26] gdkpgold: for low lvl u can kill dwarves that drop key for a guarenteed chest
[1:34:45] gdkpgold: its very common
[1:35:43] bodkinz_: they added new stuff to rep that vendor?
[1:36:42] PremiuM15: rog tanking PrideToucan
[1:37:41] gdkpgold: every tank rogue is better than payo tanking on warrior
[1:37:47] PremiuM15: guess beeing world first player might help but not sure how it feels for u
[1:38:40] JoeBangles_: KEKW
[1:38:45] gdkpgold: kek
[1:39:19] iNSANEono: rly fun game

[1:49:49] Slythix_: idk why u wouldnt
[1:49:51] WillowJane: like they dont tip when in US? or dont tip while in EU?
[1:49:55] tepsx: depends on th country.
[1:49:57] xodo1313: do whatever the hell you want with your own money
[1:49:59] itsquetzy: I wish US did the same
[1:50:00] salk76: :icantmalta:
[1:50:02] TonyTwoTokes: Gotta do it if in the USA, but over in eu obviously who cares power to them

[1:50:10] sigilfish: @WillowJane i wouldnt tip in NA
[1:50:10] helpdogsonmyleg: Unfortunately the restaurants dont pay waiters minimum wage in US, so much of the income is tip based
[1:50:12] Slythix_: @Lmgd1 why dont ppl in EU tip? genuinely curious
[1:50:12] salk76: I'm mad bro
[1:50:16] ryedog_97: nah just sucks your EU workers
[1:50:17] simplerick96: tipping makes me mad
[1:50:19] WillowJane: if theyre in the EU no, cuz they actually get paid a livable wage
[1:50:24] helpdogsonmyleg: EU has living wage low income
[1:50:27] WillowJane: if theyre not tipping in NA, then its kinda scummy but its not their fault
[1:50:42] JFigg33: that is the case
[1:50:44] Snaketrap: NA cash tips dodge taxes
[1:50:50] MonzonWasTaken: i told you that broodah
[1:50:51] Stradh_: still restaurants are scumbags on low pay
[1:50:57] Slythix_: @Lmgd1 waiters can be paid $3/hr at the lowest i think in America
[1:51:01] Slythix_: its so trash
[1:51:02] itsquetzy: waiters get paid $4.5 per hour, minimum wage is $8
[1:51:03] Mattysaiyan: Sure but why is that the customers problem
[1:51:11] JFigg33: I made 4$ an hour before tips for a jobh I had in collge minimum wage was 8$
[1:51:12] WillowJane: federal minimum wage is about $7.25... but server minimum wage can vary by state but is usually $2-3 DIESOFCRINGEbutinHD
[1:51:17] MawblesPDX: My wifes dad came to visit from Sweden and he was damn near offended when a restraunt asked for a tip when he paid lol

[1:51:40] Snaketrap: pepeLaugh
[1:51:44] Slythix_: tip culture is still out of control outside of waiting tho
[1:51:47] SmokeyZugs: We don't mind if Europeans don't tip in EU establishments, we also don't tip when we are in EU
[1:51:50] Slythix_: like tipping for just regular things nowadays

[5:12:37] g0dzilla: yes

It has been confirmed that all sorts of kills can trigger her to spawn, including the previously mentioned Naga or even PvP kills. However, it does seem as if they have to be around your level, so aim for mobs that are at least level 32. Some users have also reported that reloading the game or clearing your cache folder might help if you are struggling to get her to show up.
