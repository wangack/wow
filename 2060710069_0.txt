[2:22:46] Nightbot: Method Class Guides, Amirdrassil Boss Guides and Mythic+ Dungeon Guides are now available --> https://link.method.gg/sco-guides
[2:22:50] Masqerader: yes, it was a great week for pushing
[2:22:57] Masqerader: as long as your healer don't dc :P
[2:23:49] Xronik07: Sco what year did you start playing wow?
[2:24:35] Boromlr: You started during your uni days? I thought you said you did it then
[2:24:52] Xronik07: omg so long ago
[2:25:53] Masqerader: I have yet to see the mount thing drop for me in here, everyone else in my group has seen it, me... nope
[2:26:11] Xronik07: Which expansion have you played the least?
[2:26:37] Boromlr: I see you got m+ timer weak aura, I got it recently too, it is very nice
[2:26:44] Boromlr: Oh that is from details
[2:26:46] Boromlr: my bad
[2:27:31] Masqerader: it is details
[2:27:37] Masqerader: SL?
[2:27:43] Boromlr: Since you retired
[2:27:48] Boromlr: I would say this exp
[2:27:53] rdzeniuu: DF is honestly pretty damn good exp
[2:27:54] Boromlr: !retired
[2:27:58] Nightbot: Retiring as a tank from the raid team. I remain just as committed to pushing Method towards our 13th WF, but I will be doing that from outside of the raid! Thanks for the continued support, tweet here: https://twitter.com/Methodsco/status/1596209821879267328 & full video talking about it: https://youtu.be/0pQ5V4hF6LM
[2:28:27] khalid_ce92: i give this expansion 3/10
[2:28:34] khalid_ce92: i said before 2/10
[2:28:38] Xronik07: DF>SL
[2:28:43] khalid_ce92: i give it 3/10
[2:28:44] rdzeniuu: Lore is the worst aspect of DF
[2:28:52] Xronik07: BFA>SL
[2:29:04] Masqerader: compared to SL it's miles ahead
[2:29:20] Boromlr: My favourite expac was Legion but I don't know much about Lore
[2:29:43] Masqerader: Shadowlands was a shit sandwich the whole way through, Lore/Systems
[2:29:48] Boromlr: you get 250 from each seed
[2:29:51] Masqerader: seeds + bloom
[2:29:56] recede_: Legion for me will take alot of beating
[2:30:04] Xronik07: @Boromlr legion lore was perfect bro
[2:30:20] khalid_ce92: legion is best also on M+ system
[2:30:20] Boromlr: @Xronik07 It could be true, I just dont know any lore, or not much :D
[2:30:33] Masqerader: for me expansions its goes  Legion, MOP, DF and the rest
[2:30:35] Boromlr: Legendary RNG was not much fun at start.
[2:30:35] Masqerader: yes
[2:31:00] Masqerader: Ya, if u got the long legendary since u were capped at like 4? you had to reroll your char basically which was dumb
[2:31:02] recede_: artifact weapons was good
[2:31:05] Masqerader: *wrong
[2:31:20] Boromlr: the legendary feeling when you got the one you wanted was pretty pog
[2:31:22] Masqerader: mission tables
[2:31:26] Masqerader: wait that was WOD
[2:31:28] khalid_ce92: M+ ilvl gear was same as mythic raid
[2:31:36] khalid_ce92: was so good for M+ players to enjoy
[2:31:50] Xronik07: yep the legion was a huge step towards success
[2:32:10] Masqerader: I remember when they had the 12 hr legion missions to progress your story/class hall etc
[2:32:12] Masqerader: like wtf
[2:32:21] recede_: legion had mission tables
[2:32:24] Boromlr: Mission tables for heroic loot was nice though, no?
[2:32:43] Boromlr: Controversial but I loved the Garrison of WOD
[2:32:45] Masqerader: it was in the beginning, especially for class hall
[2:33:04] rdzeniuu: and major class changes
[2:33:45] Masqerader: some of the missions were way to long on that table, not as bad as shipyard though ...24hr missions 96% chance to be successful,  and it fails
[2:34:29] Masqerader: 1 week left of getting no love rocket
[2:34:33] Boromlr: The APower grind on Legion for that 1% of stats was not much fun, needing like 500 thrillion AP for next point on artefact
[2:34:35] Xronik07: @Boromlr location design and music were so great for me on WoD
[2:34:42] recede_: was BFA the first RWF that got broadcast?
[2:35:01] rdzeniuu: I was there for Uldir
[2:35:11] recede_: yeah same was awesome to watch
[2:35:25] Masqerader: loved BFA, especially drustvar
[2:36:21] Masqerader: Legion also brought us WQ/emissary which were fun, same with BFA, then they brought out "world quest 2.0" in SL and that stuff sucked
[2:36:51] ViljoBenzo: What kind of defensive would you add to hunters? I feel like they are by far the weakest class in m+ content
[2:36:54] Boromlr: It was weird, I was there for each RWF you got live, I would often log out for hours and tune in the exact pull you got it, felt like a good luck charm haha
[2:37:40] recede_: BM hunters have insane mobility though tbh and still able to maintain dps
[2:38:10] Xronik07: Blizzard has kept location design and music at a very high level for 20 years
[2:38:32] Boromlr: Content is not always the best but raids are usually VERY solid.
[2:38:46] Boromlr: They always look aesthetically pleasing.
[2:39:12] ViljoBenzo: the cd on that one is a bit long for the effect? Wdyt
[2:39:20] Boromlr: I main MM hunter and I do feel like it could be better with an extra or stronger heal, or Exhill cd reduced.
[2:39:32] Boromlr: Or bring back the feign death damage reduction ability.
[2:39:34] Boromlr: There is.
[2:40:08] Boromlr: When you feign death you used to take 3 6 9 12% less damage for a short period. That was with SL or BFA
[2:40:28] Masqerader: saw the legendary drop in a heroic kill this week, but not for my paladin =(
[2:40:42] recede_: if anything they need to remove them forced quest that pop up with u travel to old zones lol
[2:42:39] Nightbot: Method Class Guides, Amirdrassil Boss Guides and Mythic+ Dungeon Guides are now available --> https://link.method.gg/sco-guides
[2:43:28] Boromlr: When you doing another viewer run?
[2:43:36] Boromlr: If you are
[2:44:33] Boromlr: I will keep an eye out for it.
[2:46:10] Boromlr: Alas, no.
[2:46:35] Boromlr: HBO ROme
[2:46:45] Boromlr: HBO Rome has a proper historian
[2:46:52] Boromlr: As consultant
[2:46:54] ChopperYami: Why in Denmark currently ?
[2:47:11] Boromlr: My professor is the historical consultant for the latest big Roman show
[2:47:18] ChopperYami: ^^
[2:47:22] Boromlr: Domina
[2:47:30] Boromlr: It is into the second series.
[2:47:44] Boromlr: Yeah the wife of the first emperor, Augustus
[2:48:07] Boromlr: I have not seen it yet, but I have plans to order it.
[2:48:16] Boromlr: A second series usually means its popular.
[2:48:22] Boromlr: HBO Rome was special
[2:48:36] Boromlr: It had an amazing cast.
[2:48:39] Boromlr: Is it?
[2:48:45] Boromlr: Must be!
[2:49:05] Boromlr: s3 it must be then, I have not talked to her, the consultant, in a while
[2:49:13] Boromlr: Take care @Sco
[2:49:14] Xronik07: All the best
