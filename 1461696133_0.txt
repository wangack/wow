[0:04:10] reduxo: I think the expansion looks cool, but the dragon race is way over sexualized for it to look like a game

[0:16:07] Dirtnose: think for HS its team 5, and so on
[0:16:41] NEMERL: 2-3 monthis its too early
[0:16:44] Collected1: i recommend watching the wrath announcement with headphones. the audio track is incredible.

[0:18:40] Kisswani: watching the cinematic a second time felt better than watching it on the reveal . now that the confusion is gone you can start focusing on some of the incredible details

[0:19:19] WayneG947: @Kisswani True, I was like "what am i watching right now?" the first time haha
[0:19:33] Thoreya: im still buzzing from yesterday
[0:19:40] Thoreya: what a rush
[0:19:40] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[0:19:59] Kisswani: yeah it was incredible . can't wait to hear more about endgame
[0:20:04] LilleM00: it's just my guess. And i think that this "new" listening Blizzard will want to get player response asap
[0:20:08] TacDuc: The earlier they get the beta out the more people can test it, even if it is an unfinished mess players can help fix stuff
[0:20:58] MarquisLek: i'm still hoping that in 10.1 or something we will get more dragons then the big 5 like netherwing, storm drakes and stone drakes etc.
[0:21:00] Thoreya: if i dont get into alpha i riot :)
[0:21:04] MarquisLek: also talent revamp = shaman tank
[0:21:30] LilleM00: Shaman tank would be so dope
[0:21:30] NEMERL: @lillem00 Our voice not only this 1% of content creators, thats why they should take it slowly
[0:21:44] Thoreya: i think every healer can get a kick now
[0:21:47] Thoreya: which is interesting
[0:21:51] Carahail: not gonna lie,I almost died when I saw the talent revamp. I got that excited
[0:21:54] saltyohm: pom pyro mage plz and ty
[0:21:58] swordart2022: @marquislek what you mean like different style of dragon or what?Sylverian Dreamer and shaman tank is not a thing
[0:22:23] h_u_r_k_: i want to be a feral druid healer
[0:22:32] LilleM00: I can't see any benefits of taking it slowly?
[0:22:33] NEMERL: thye blowup my mind with this all changes
[0:22:54] swordart2022: Some takes here can spot who doesn't even play wow right now
[0:23:13] swordart2022: @h_u_r_k_ so play rearo with feral affinity
[0:23:20] im_capy: Wondering if the new flight mode will become a thing after 10.0 across all of Azeroth. New world tree in place of sword, Dragon isle saved....and all of azeroth is "updated" to allow the new flying.
[0:23:23] swordart2022: *resto
[0:23:36] grumpnamedjosh: I think it‚Äôs completely fair to give the game hype. Nobody is going like every single aspect of the game (like the race/class for me personally). Not having a dark, world ending boss story and going back to a grounded, probably more relating story is something I‚Äôm more than happy with.
[0:23:42] Coriollis: @Mr_Capy_ what sword
[0:23:53] grumpnamedjosh: What sword Kappa
[0:23:58] cappei: yeah, are you high? what sword, bro
[0:24:13] swordart2022: I got one KappaPride
[0:24:15] Fawcheddar: no sword here
[0:24:19] h_u_r_k_: sword is for the next xpac
[0:24:23] Deaconz_Gaming: Sargarus
[0:24:26] CritcobainTV: Just daggers for me
[0:24:33] xX_SiXXiS_Xx: I‚Äôm sure there going to be people that love every part@of the expac. There are still some diehard fans
[0:24:37] swordart2022: @critcobain KEKW
[0:24:42] NEMERL: to work out every detail they need time, new talents, new class/race, new zone, new story, professions
[0:24:49] Coriollis: I', excited for everything except for the drakthyr transformed shaped, they need to Sonic that stuff
[0:24:50] reduxo: just coom to dragons and forget about the sword already
[0:25:04] cabalish: @Mr_Capy_ not directly, first dragon riding only in the new dragonflight areas, with 'maybe' plans for later implementation for whole azeroth
[0:25:07] Collected1: my tin foil hat theory, they've held back some features for the May live stream
[0:25:14] Collected1: to get eyes on the mobile game
[0:25:29] xX_SiXXiS_Xx: I personally dislike the@look of the dragon ppl race, and hate that it‚Äôs basically another elf when they already limited us with demon hunters
[0:25:58] grumpypizzaguy: is the stream over or starting soon?
[0:26:05] h_u_r_k_: wow will come to consoles too
[0:26:07] h_u_r_k_: bet
[0:26:11] DigitalChill: starting soon
[0:26:13] rebuk: @grumpypizzaguy `Starting. It takes like 30 minutes to start
[0:26:18] im_capy: @cabalish thats what I was hinting at. I think 10.0 will be all dragon isle, then itll open up Azeroth to "new" features so to speak
[0:26:24] cabalish: !thoon @grumpypizzaguy
[0:26:24] Moobot: @grumpypizzaguy thit thusually thakes ~45 mins thafter thoing thive thoo thart. thits theen 26:31 thince thee thent thive. thab thome thnacks thor tho thoo thomething, the thream thill thart THOON‚Ñ¢
[0:26:26] Dirtnose: WoW on N64 incoming
[0:26:39] cabalish: @Mr_Capy_ yes
[0:26:44] h_u_r_k_: full controller support
[0:26:50] grumpnamedjosh: Wonder if they will go back to the older drop rate for quest items if this expansion is more focused on exploration and questing just to make the questing last longer.
[0:27:08] Coriollis: I mean I was expecting BWL dragons and drakes not gonna lie
[0:27:19] swordart2022: @faithlessday Don't min max skip everything then
[0:27:33] Deaconz_Gaming: Who is the bad guy in the expansion?
[0:27:36] swordart2022: @faithlessday I lvled days from 50 to 60
[0:27:51] tonyr23: @faithlessday  God I hope not
[0:27:52] xX_SiXXiS_Xx: Wait is there going to be a black dragon flight or just the ugly colours?
[0:27:53] h_u_r_k_: if Galakrond is in this, imagine the size he will be.
[0:27:57] Coriollis: I wonder if Samwise gave his green light on the drakthyr transformations
[0:28:04] cabalish: @deaconz_gaming we do not know of yet
[0:28:07] NEMERL: @faithlessday bad idea
[0:28:50] cabalish: @xX_SiXXiS_Xx black is in, yes
[0:28:55] NEMERL: @deaconz_gaming the whole expansion story will lead us to this knowlege
[0:29:02] rebuk: @deaconz_gaming A leak that got everything right so far said the big bad is murozond which would fit nicely. It would mean our Nozdormu finally goes evil
[0:29:35] h_u_r_k_: i'd rather see Galakrond

[0:30:31] grumpnamedjosh: @fairplay2021 it‚Äôs not really min max though if you have to get 5 of something and they all drop off a single pack of mobs.  Questing just goes way to fast now and a expansion based off questing will feel like way to short of a expansion. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unrealistic to think they‚Äôd want to slow it down a bit.
[0:30:37] Dirtnose: and theyre blaming password sharers LUL
[0:30:44] Radtvlol: @Collected1 what happened?
[0:30:54] swordart2022: @faithlessday nonsense
[0:31:27] swordart2022: @faithlessday there is classic for it.
[0:31:42] Collected1: RADtvlol : they reported a drop in subs for the first time
[0:31:56] NEMERL: Why slow it down, this game is about end game not farming mobs for q
[0:32:08] Collected1: plus Elon tweeted about them which never helps
[0:32:23] swordart2022: @nemerl speak for yourself and 8f you min max your choice
[0:32:31] DragonofWolves: I stopped taking Elon seriously lol
[0:32:32] swordart2022: @collected1 KEKW
[0:32:47] bob2305: Elon slowly becoming Lex Luthor

[0:39:28] grumpnamedjosh: What sword, don‚Äôt you mean DUCKS finally.
[0:40:05] DragonofWolves: oh and FYI, the Dracthyr dance is a sort of hardstyle shuffle dance.

[0:40:32] NEMERL: @DragonofWolves pre-orders in middle of this year i guess
[0:40:36] MrFuzzynuts420: wait is stream ending or starting?
[0:40:41] madmike_99: they didn't even start alpha, what does that mean? Release in late 2023?
[0:40:42] cabalish: the ducks will finally fly to silithus in pre-patch 11.0 and lift the sword and heal all da whoonz
[0:40:46] swordart2022: Starting
[0:41:24] DigitalChill: @cabalish that would be epic

[0:41:36] Tokies: Yo, good job on yesterday's announcement show it was good.
[0:41:38] cabalish: @madmike_99 alpha in june maybe, release tba
[0:41:49] Collected1: TIMES CHANGE SMOrc
[0:41:52] grumpnamedjosh: We still need to hear about some type of ‚Äúportal pass‚Äù for WotLK first before we get a DF preorder
[0:41:53] Tokies: Yo Chat
[0:42:04] DragonofWolves: I at first thought the Dracthyr dance was like two stepping but when I saw someone put shuffle music to it on twitter, I'm like well that makes a lot more sense now
[0:42:09] Tokies: @faithlessday like a season pass?
[0:42:19] Kneckt: @faithlessday why the hell would we need to know about that first lol 2 different games
[0:42:34] Tokies: @faithlessday It's not that hard to make gold token in retail though.
[0:42:46] AinaTan3: the new dragon race feels like some furry fetish, ngl
[0:42:53] madmike_99: AngelThump

[0:45:04] DragonofWolves: Well I mean you don't have to be a furry to like dragons lol. Besides the next year of the dragon is in 2024
[0:45:14] propwash80: is the stream starting or ending?
[0:45:14] Vivelli: @Tai_Silverward true
[0:45:24] kyoone07: yo bpys, when will the crossfaction stuff come out?
[0:45:25] Radtvlol: @propwash80 starting
[0:45:33] Fatalis83: @Vivelli .... *renames guild*
[0:45:36] bob_the_demon: No preorder is probably a legal (in some locals) cya since they probably can't put a release timeframe on it
[0:45:37] propwash80: cool ty @rad
[0:45:42] Vivelli: haha
[0:45:46] Kisswani: ok enough twitter for today , I saw some people going off about the sundering and I searched for why , oh dear god
[0:45:47] psyracks: I thought people hated pre-orders? Blizz doesn't offer one and everyone is like "Where's the pre-order?"
[0:45:51] Collected1: bob_the_demon : that's never stopped them before
[0:46:04] AinaTan3: It's not about liking dragons or animals, it's about how they are drawn. Looks like some deviant art furry art

[0:46:53] Kisswani: @propwash80 we dont talk about that anymore Kappa
[0:46:55] Radtvlol: @kyoone07 9.2.5 i think

[0:47:05] Collected1: propwash80 : Lilian Voss
[0:47:10] Malitor: scourge = bruno
[0:47:15] bob_the_demon: @Collected1 iirc any earlier oreorders came with at least some sort of release timeframe
[0:47:17] Goji_o7: @fairplay2021 stop wanking to bronies
[0:47:17] rebuk: @propwash80 The scourge are running rampant. The strongest among them are fighting for control according to Bolvar/Darion dialogue after the Sylvanas trial
[0:47:26] swordart2022: @kyoone07 second part of year I think
[0:47:36] Kneckt: All pre orders usually say on or before X.X.XXXX
[0:47:39] Collected1: bob_the_demon : sure but they could do the same now, ie, On or Before March 31st 2023
[0:47:44] kyoone07: thanks chat <3
[0:47:56] swordart2022: @tonedead96 need translation for that
[0:48:04] Kisswani: yeah they literally could have said before 31st dec 2023 and we're good
[0:48:05] Radtvlol: I doubt they know if they can get DF out by spring 2023
[0:48:25] bob_the_demon: @Collected1 Maybe they don't feel comfortable enough to even say that rn
[0:48:28] Kneckt: itl come out sooner than expected

[0:48:33] DragonofWolves: And honestly I think the Dracthyr (holy shit spelling that is going to take some getting used to) are designed like that one boss from Cata
[0:48:54] Radtvlol: @Kneckt why would they rush it?
[0:48:54] rebuk: @Kneckt The leak that got everything right so far said Q1 2023. I'm inclined to continue believing it xD
[0:49:18] Shalamyne: @DragonofWolves Maloriak?

[0:50:33] Kneckt: @bingo5555 Microsoft has no hand in current development
[0:50:36] Rayzodoom: no way after seeing yesterday
[0:50:37] swordart2022: @frank4lulz good morning KappaPride
[0:50:42] mavericks312: @bingo5555 that wouldnt effect anything really
[0:50:44] Silverwards: lmao for a Nov release we needed Alpha yesterday. that's not enough time
[0:50:49] rebuk: @Cappaie I'm mainly supporting the one that the red shirt guy was going on about. That said I figured/hoped for November but you're right. Between then and early 2023
[0:50:51] harris243124: What should I have for breakfast chat
[0:51:00] Kneckt: @tai_silverward not necessarily
[0:51:03] Frank4LuLz: @fairplay2021  good morning sexy
[0:51:07] Coriollis: evan if the MS deal goes completly through u will not see stuff changin till 2024 earliest
[0:51:15] MrFuzzynuts420: @harris243124 pizza. it's the breakfast of champions
[0:51:16] grumpnamedjosh: Maybe the release date won‚Äôt be until after the merge, and the expansion will launch on game pass or something. Who knows with Activ/Blizzard.
[0:51:17] Carahail: @harris243124 bacon an Gefuel
[0:51:26] cappei: Yeah, I don't believe in 2022 either. Just saying that another one who was 100% correct on his leaks stated that. Still think early 2023
[0:51:35] mavericks312: @bingo5555 oh sor sure the overlord days are done
[0:51:42] mcloveinu716: beer @harris243124  lol
[0:51:53] DragonofWolves: Shalamyne https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Maloriak YES!
[0:52:11] DragonofWolves: I think hes what inspired the design tbh
[0:52:11] Nerendis: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[0:52:16] rebuk: @Cappaie Did that leak also state who the main villain was? Haven't seen that leak
[0:52:19] mavericks312: ima say mid february release
[0:52:30] NEMERL: New expansion need atleast one more year of dev
[0:52:34] MTCason: It cannot be 2023 ... that would mean nearly a year with no content.  This is THE last update for Shadowlands.
[0:52:47] KingSlayerYotam: Did towelliee covered the hazelnut interview?
[0:52:50] Dirtnose: @MTCason we do get season 4 though, which would indicate a longer wait
[0:52:52] Rayzodoom: I'm hoping more interviews soon
[0:52:55] Kneckt: November-Dec 22 screenshot this for when I‚Äôm right
[0:52:56] swordart2022: @mtcason clueless LUL
[0:52:57] Coriollis: @rebuk Murazond but they could change that
[0:52:57] mavericks312: @MTCason were getting a season 4
[0:53:03] NEMERL: @MTCason we have 9.2.5
[0:53:11] Ikaros1209: @MTCason yes thats what i think too
[0:53:15] DragonofWolves: MTCason We've had longer content droughts plus we have 9.2.5
[0:53:21] MTCason: And?  That does not last a year.
[0:53:22] cappei: @rebuk No, and it wasn't written in 1 entire post. It was a guy on mmo-champion leaking over a few days, but it was before the 4chan one, so that makes me thing the 4chan guy might just be piggybacking off the mmo-champion leaks
[0:53:23] mcloveinu716: 2023 nov
[0:53:37] mavericks312: the main baddie is 1 of 3, murozond galarond or chromatus
[0:53:39] Kneckt: Idk why ppl don‚Äôt think they can shorten shit however they want lol. They don‚Äôt have to stick to any length of season etc
[0:53:42] swordart2022: @mtcason you don't play wow KEKW
[0:53:50] Ikaros1209: season 4 i in my opinion pure garbage
[0:53:52] grumpnamedjosh: I think 2-3 months after WotLK Classic is when it will release. They wont release them to close together.
[0:53:56] MTCason: @fairplay2021 I do
[0:54:13] rebuk: @Cappaie Ah ok makes sense
[0:54:21] mavericks312: wrath classic is august id guess and 10.0 is january february
[0:54:21] stallowned: good morning peeps towHAMUP
[0:54:34] MTCason: The one responsible for leaking Dragonflight says November 2022
[0:54:44] swordart2022: @mtcason If you think cross faction 3 raids of gear new season ijuat as current is no content no clue why you play even
[0:54:59] NEMERL: @MTCason maby beta Nov 22
[0:55:00] TigasLIVE: The leaker said woltk in september 2022 and 10.0 on nov 2022
[0:55:14] MTCason: @fairplay2021 What I SAID was that cannot be the only content for a year
[0:55:18] Ikaros1209: @MTCason right and he was very confident when he said that
[0:55:23] DragonofWolves: I doubt it'll be this year, unless Blizz crunches and rushes it, and they need nor to
[0:55:31] cappei: Yeah, Nov 2022 sounds fucking nuts. But considering he was right about everything else? Who knows
[0:55:31] mavericks312: @MTCason were not gonna have alpha till jun/july no way release is novemeber
[0:55:49] Collected1: it could be this year if they're going with a smaller set of features and plan to drop other features into subsequent dot patches
[0:55:55] Collected1: that may explain why the features list feels short
[0:55:57] hikaritd: Ive been telling to people that 2022 is the DF release but Im constantly getting booo-d LUL  However we got nothing from the live show, it was boring, so it means its in super alpha
[0:56:00] Armdel: Oh Hazelnuttygames just uploaded an interview with Ion
[0:56:02] TigasLIVE: They will release on the holydays believe me, they want that christmas money KEKW
[0:56:03] swordart2022: @mtcason what are you on about last patch is live just two months,9.2.5 easily for year
[0:56:16] Coriollis: the xpack date is 2-3 weeks after current pvp season ends , always been like that
[0:56:21] Ikaros1209: it  has to be this year. sl was so low content with cut conent....i dont know how they will justify a 2023 release
[0:56:26] swordart2022: @mtcason or when bored quit normal things
[0:56:30] Shalamyne: Since they don't have a huge player power system this xpac, i wouldn't doubt seeing a Nov release
[0:56:48] cruzeal: sup towHAMUP
[0:56:50] MTCason: @mavericks312 We have no idea what their timetable is.  Not saying it is going to be X, Y, or Z ... only that they cannot send off Shadowlands a year before the new expac.
[0:57:32] mcloveinu716: LK in 2022 in nov and mid summer new epx
[0:57:33] Collected1: perhaps rather than having big bang expansions with a peak in subs they're trying to spread the subs out by spreading features out. so like housing 10.1 etc. (complete speculation probably totally wrong)
[0:57:34] DragonofWolves: That being said though they still have things they'll talk about at a later date so Dragonflight might have more features that are TBD.
[0:57:37] mavericks312: @MTCason again were getting a season 4 with mythic+ raiding
[0:57:38] im_capy: Itll be end of year most likely, wrath will market the company for the 6 months leading up to it imo
[0:57:39] swordart2022: @mtcason you never played end of expact KEKW
[0:57:53] boopbopbamski: did streamer go afk or is this still the intro?
[0:58:03] mavericks312: most end of xpac droughts are close to a year so yea they can
[0:58:06] jerexify: Intro.
[0:58:07] devoted_bee: Someone forgot to bring a Towel
[0:58:10] Alienfromger: 1hr intro new record? LUL
[0:58:10] hikaritd: Wrath coming 2022 summer -> 3 months and they hype dies -> DF 2022 Nov/Dec. Easy
[0:58:13] Dirtnose: !intro
[0:58:14] cappei: Jesus christ

[0:58:29] cruzeal: ok dude lol
[0:58:29] grumpnamedjosh: If people push for a rework of the how the dragon looks they will most likely delay whatever date they originally had set. Just depends on what the majority feedback they get in alpha
[0:58:29] TSquadSully: WAYTOODANK

[1:06:56] BoezIRL: you can see azerite in the water
[1:06:57] Rayzodoom: dragons left because the land lost power. can't live with the power out if you are a dragon I guess
[1:06:58] lmtheboogie: He felt a tingling in his rectum
[1:07:00] JWoody82: Dragons told him to look for their coming at first light on the fifth day, to the east
[1:07:01] Bernardo994: i think thats y they are made they just know what to do
[1:07:02] cabalish: blizz working on more account-wide stuff

[1:07:17] XimBaa: you can see the sea glowing
[1:07:19] grumpnamedjosh: I thought he woke up when he felt the energy come back to the island, which is why all the plant life are waking up also in the cinematic
[1:07:21] im_capy: Sl was all a dream, he woke up from it for us
[1:07:22] giggachadwar: Check the colours in the water in the cinematic as he wake up
[1:07:24] duffluv22: @towelliee did you see the Hazel interview with Ion?
[1:07:25] CipansR_Ayaya: I think 10k years is enough to light a beacon
[1:07:25] Rayzodoom: theory is azerite, the sea glowing
[1:07:26] buckyiiv: The real question is how do we enjoy shadowlands having now seen what we have cmoing next
[1:07:26] honkblarg: it was the sundering
[1:07:29] Templexx: i dont even hate that like why its hidden
[1:07:31] honkblarg: that made them hide the isles
[1:07:37] Coriollis: if they explain it in a book agane and not in game I'm gonna flip
[1:07:39] Malitor: Hazelnuttygames has a good interview with Ion
[1:07:40] MayroVision: Is there a new Max level?
[1:07:41] IianaDRK: the dragon isles are where the titans gave the aspects their powers at the end of the dawn of the aspects book iirc
[1:07:42] Warcsman: Sup dudes :)
[1:07:49] DragonofWolves: Towelliee, well did the jailer not draw power from Azerite in ICC during the raid? He could have felt that surge of energy?
[1:07:50] Velashen: he woke up realizing the dream he had about a tinkerer fixing things wasn‚Äôt true so he had to get busy.
[1:07:51] Nazz_1138: i think this is like Mists, where they tell the main story without letting us know
[1:07:53] Sniper_Penguin: He felt a disturbance in the force
[1:07:53] tubbipack: the sword probably
[1:07:55] narkos2310: Ye lvl 70

[1:07:58] Nazz_1138: i'm guessing we learn that in the first few
[1:07:59] Kelbzter: @mayrovision 70
[1:08:01] j_wel: They wanted to come home
[1:08:02] IianaDRK: didnt they said azeroths awakening?
[1:08:02] kaybrink: jailer
[1:08:03] FrankTizzle: Infinite
[1:08:03] Collected1: yeah probably
[1:08:07] Fenixzzz: wrathion
[1:08:07] shrektard69: What is your guess for   10.0 release @towelliee
[1:08:07] xmirrxrs: its something we have learned about yet
[1:08:10] MayroVision: @kelbzter thanks
[1:08:10] griffdog125: it's MAGNEEE
[1:08:10] Collected1: the dragons said they're back to save azeroth
[1:08:11] Armdel: don't they say its because Azeroth is healing
[1:08:12] vaironixx: Nah i think they were waking up cause the dragons were back looking for the dragon isles again, thats why they were woken up again to show the way
[1:08:13] Clotic_: The sword Kappa
[1:08:13] Bernardo994: we have been bussy
[1:08:13] noosphear: A giant sword in the side of the planet?
[1:08:14] im_capy: Maybe death of zovaal
[1:08:14] kokochris: timed based ?  like he was supposed to wake up then
[1:08:14] Xanigh: i mean, they said that now the elemental energy is flowing again
[1:08:16] Rohen86: I believe it is Azeroth waking up and releasing energy
[1:08:16] Nazz_1138: I think its the elemental dragons " proto dragons" waking up
[1:08:16] xmirrxrs: Probably has to do wihth Sword
[1:08:18] PipTown: they said azeroth is healing, the isle lost its connection to the elements during the sundering
[1:08:19] mayhemguy: he had morning stone
[1:08:19] KaptnG: The land was rumbling, that woke him up
[1:08:20] Templexx: just bad weather coming
[1:08:20] bob2305: they said they needed to protect azeroth
[1:08:20] Sylphy_TV: Can we have a Stoney Tony emote?
[1:08:22] MrGharr: What sword?
[1:08:22] fearlessfungi: I bet it's Chromatus or the sword
[1:08:24] killercondon: Giant dragon dude
[1:08:24] Shongoshi: maybe sargeras sword, the cinematic doesnt have to be after shadowlands
[1:08:24] joeltso: the sword in silithus
[1:08:25] FallenxGabe: Death of jailer maybe
[1:08:25] Molehj: He could feel it in his STONES
[1:08:26] mcloveinu716: DEATHWING 2 ??
[1:08:28] Alexkayzz: @Towelliee  Dan User explained in the deep dive
[1:08:28] lmtheboogie: The failure of shadowlands triggered him to wake up
[1:08:28] HaloS23: @Towelliee Either the azerite in the water or the earthquakes I'd say
[1:08:29] Leystra: Guesss the real question is why the land woke up. Maybe the world soul has something to do with it?
[1:08:30] Aidler: question is: what else can you hide on this world?
[1:08:30] NEMERL: THE COSMOS DEVIDED WILL NOT SURVIVE
[1:08:31] cabalish: hdr on
[1:08:34] KaptnG: Prob the shit from Zovaal?
[1:08:35] UltraKSlaya: good mornin
[1:08:35] flushjay: HeyGuys
[1:08:36] BrotherBeezy: He proably just really had to pee and figured that he should just get up at this point.
[1:08:41] MrBailik: it likely has something to do with balance. balance in the forces wakes up the isles
[1:08:41] Templexx: wooonnnnnnss
[1:08:49] luckfore: in 9.2.5 we will remove sword and plant new world tree and azeroth will heal again EZ
[1:08:50] mavericks312: healing..meanwhile she has a space sword in her
[1:08:51] CritcobainTV: Tauren sounds KEKW
[1:08:52] TheKitsuneAdventures: from what we know  there old enemies also  waken up as well so  maybe  an  anicnet  enemy is  coming  back
[1:08:55] MayroVision: I just wanna roll rogue and ambush and wrecccck noobs
[1:08:56] reinhardtdog: I just figured the events of Shadowlands somehow triggered it.
[1:08:58] PvtHudson093: maybe 9.2.5 has a story telling us why the dragon isles is waking up
[1:08:59] vaironixx: yeah there is rumors of the sword will be pulled out or turned into a new world tree
[1:09:03] Cal_Kat: didnt they sacrafice all their power at some point?
[1:09:05] MrGharr: The ocean was bright blue in the cinematic, maybe it's connected.
[1:09:06] Kneckt: Ion hzel interview pog
[1:09:07] Coriollis: maybe he just lookedd towards the place where he come to the sea from, because u see him going there to the temple/place/beacon afterwards to check on it , so it might be something withe water xd (sry paragraph)
[1:09:08] strixzius: Maybe because of the jailer is dead
[1:09:09] JWoody82: Ysera beat us to the shadowlands
[1:09:09] eaglerydr: Azeroth psychic powers felt the threat and Stonebro being elemental felt the threat
[1:09:10] Psyphin808: maybe the big sword was removed before the xpac and the lands started to heal
[1:09:10] veroggo99: He felt the Elemental Energy come back
[1:09:11] BravocadoBrad: cause story telling has been ass lately lol
[1:09:11] Short_Film: Where have all the dragons been? And didnt they lose powers in Cata? "Age of mortals"
[1:09:12] Kneckt: hazel
[1:09:12] grumpnamedjosh: I‚Äôll tell you what didn‚Äôt cause him to wake up, the giant fucking sword in the ground
[1:09:17] xsveninatorx: that weighted blanket of Plot Armor was too comfy
[1:09:19] lithium364: @Towelliee new hazelnutty Ion interview
[1:09:23] fearlessfungi: I mean, it's gotta be more existential than the Shadowlands *or* Deathwing, right? lmao
[1:09:23] conv3rge_: life alert
[1:09:23] xsveninatorx: had to snooze
[1:09:23] KaptnG: True
[1:09:24] andrewmb01: no flight paths in dragonflight?
[1:09:29] Clucky2988: cause of the sword in silithus
[1:09:30] Rayzodoom: I think I'm an interview they said the first quest zone will explain why it woke up and such
[1:09:31] MrGharr: Where is the hazel interview?
[1:09:31] MammothGB: Alex must have been near in order to swoop in and save stonebro so quick
[1:09:32] KingSlayerYotam: @Towelliee Did you see the hazal Ion interview?
[1:09:35] MiddlePhaze: @Towelliee cuz of what the jailer just did, it woke up azeroth and that island
[1:09:37] Rayzodoom: in*
[1:09:38] vaironixx: pretty sure its implied the guy sitting on the throne was tyr as well
[1:09:39] SpudPT: azeroth is healing with a stabbed sword in silithus..lool
[1:09:40] FallenxGabe: What‚Äôs gonna happen to us when Azeroth is born are we screwed?
[1:09:40] DVaderCY: You will learn it when the expansion should be out
[1:09:42] kokochris: this story is going to set the tone for the next expansions.  I'm hoping we get all new NPC's to drive that new era of WoW.
[1:09:44] FergusCreative: they said Azeroths beginning to awaken and heal, so the primordial energy the dragon isles lost during the sundering begins to return . aspect said when that happens then send the beacon
[1:09:52] pereadin: They were made by Tyr
[1:09:53] im_capy: its the "the great cycle" so it just has to take this course I think
[1:09:53] paxonym: maybe the stone guy was having a windows update and he wasnt able to start up in time to have the dragons fight in the maw...
[1:09:54] s_t_o_r_m__: LUL
[1:10:00] mavericks312: all i know is we better get duck mounts

[1:10:04] DarkWingXP: someone hit the life alert button
[1:10:04] giggachadwar: CHAMPIONNNNNNNNNNNNN

[1:10:42] Collected1: not until a dot patch
[1:10:46] emznev: i dont mind that tbh
[1:10:49] kokochris: for now I think its fine
[1:10:49] veroggo99: i cant wait to here more of the lore im hungrey for it :D
[1:10:50] Kelbzter: Need a Stonebro backstory just saying
[1:10:51] byrdeen45: let them get mad
[1:10:52] Coriollis: if its a success proly will implement for the rest after
[1:10:52] KaisenSiru: They want to expand the dragon riding outside the isles too at some point
[1:10:54] WayneG947: U don't pay my sub!!
[1:10:57] lithium364: they said in another interview theyre testing the new flying in dragon isles to add it later to the rest of the world
[1:10:57] FallenxGabe: Then what‚Äôs the point
[1:10:57] landsharkx_x: they why would they add the dragon flying system? it woul;d be a waste
[1:10:58] FrankTizzle: Otherwise everyone would ignore dragonriding
[1:10:58] Armdel: itll be like normal flying and we'll unlock it in 10.1
[1:10:59] mavericks312: honestly im ok with not using my mounts in the dragon iles
[1:10:59] Tzarrus: Maybe make dragon flying the new system that all flying becomes based on?
[1:11:00] fartonthebox: I got a 15 DOS this week
[1:11:01] Kneckt: @Towelliee https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKKjtXL6j8 hazel interview
[1:11:02] Crazdmadman: I dont want to play a minigame to fly
[1:11:04] killercondon: I wanna ride my special dragon outside the zone
[1:11:05] kokochris: same
[1:11:10] MammothGB: Stonebro is your first soulbind Kappa
[1:11:11] im_capy: have fun riding on that slow ass mount as people zoom past you to get the rare killed faster
[1:11:11] Endin: it will get old real fast when trying to grind your dailies
[1:11:11] Sniper_Penguin: WoW: How To Train Your Dragon
[1:11:13] bob_the_demon: It will change much like they changed mounts in the maw
[1:11:14] cappei: If dragonriding is as good as the mount flying in Gw2, trust me you won't want to use your normal flying mounts anyway LUL
[1:11:15] Khandak: Isn't dragon riding just waay faster? think they said it somewhere
[1:11:17] Endin: you just want to autofly
[1:11:30] CipansR_Ayaya: well they are
[1:11:32] dranet11: gw2 guys are fuming
[1:11:33] Aquadriel: pepelaugh
[1:11:36] sheikah0723: They're frustrated that their MMO is dying
[1:11:42] Kisswani: you should check some XIV people with the sundering KEKW
[1:11:44] noosphear: Blizzard blatantly copying things and doing it well is why we have WoW.
[1:11:45] DeanoTV: GW KEKW
[1:11:50] pereadin: Until we have a raid boss that requires us to ride them KEKW
[1:11:51] cappei: Gw2 mount system is fantastic. Good, copy the fucking good stuff. Who cares?
[1:11:51] SensationalBanana: GW2 fans are... special.
[1:11:51] ic3k0ld: Bliz is know to copy others ideas
[1:11:52] AinaTan3: guild wars invented dragon riding??? KEKW
[1:11:54] Coriollis: they'll get over it in a week
[1:11:56] MammothGB: yeah because GW never copied anything from wow KEKW
[1:11:59] SensationalBanana: They're downright hostile to WoW
[1:12:00] Aquadriel: what is guild wars gonna do, lose one of their remaining 3 players? OMEGALUL @Towelliee
[1:12:01] grumpnamedjosh: There will be a talent system for flying so if assuming they only want people to use that system
[1:12:03] Ogumel: Yeah, FFXIV folks showing their rears with the whole sundering bit
[1:12:05] NickLeonhearth: what is a guild wars 2 Kappa
[1:12:06] dranet11: gw2 has been irrelevant for 8 years
[1:12:06] abracka_: it‚Äôs a good system, why wouldn‚Äôt they want to replicate it in wow
[1:12:07] kokochris: If it works well. why wouldn't you take aspects from it !?
[1:12:08] MrGharr: Stonebro is called "Watcher Koranos" Danuser said so
[1:12:09] Dirtnose: they copied my game, REEEEE
[1:12:09] Velashen: It is going to make riding the older mounts feel so antiquated and crappy.
[1:12:09] mcloveinu716: COD SAME WAY
[1:12:10] mavericks312: blizzard been stealing ideas and doing them better for years
[1:12:12] Kneckt: Happy 420 towelliee :)
[1:12:13] Kelbzter: Like dark soul style games
[1:12:17] im_capy: cause GW was inspired by WOW and they feel entitled
[1:12:19] uzury: systems are meant to be copied
[1:12:29] shrektard69: Lmfao
[1:12:34] Mitune: GW2 has beetle racing be happy with that
[1:12:36] PipTown: they fail to see gw2 has taken inspiration from so many wow systems and designs too like legit dhuums room is a copy pase of lich king with a recolour XD
[1:12:37] enux337: end of dragons LUL  dragonflight
[1:12:38] Vexxsis: @Towelliee nah they copied dragon riding from Eragon
[1:12:42] MOLAR305: hitler's bday also
[1:12:42] TeejayOCE: 420 boiiis
[1:12:46] PipTown: its how the world works XD
[1:12:46] Alienfromger: there are gw2 people? Kappa
[1:12:47] geokouts: you mean 20/4 :P
[1:12:47] Studflex: Are you getting high today towelliee?
[1:12:49] mavericks312: but blizz perfects them
[1:12:52] im_capy: Yoshi P literally says that
[1:12:54] FallenxGabe: But wow players are also mad at wow clones so ..
[1:12:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: There have been "WoW clones" for years and years
[1:13:03] mcloveinu716: ALL GAME COPY AND PAST
[1:13:13] Alepouditsa: @geokouts ohh so i am not the only one thing what are the talking about danKEK
[1:13:17] KaisenSiru: Like Spider-Man Pog
[1:13:19] Collected1: lol called it yesterday, mini game
[1:13:20] Layercake: Every single MMO have beeing copying wow since 2004...looks like some people live in a bubble
[1:13:20] FallenxGabe: Every game has those guys
[1:13:22] Eviltuna13: You made a MMO how dare you steal that from ultima online rooMadslam
[1:13:35] lithium364: some chats yesterday were so frekaing toxic
[1:13:37] Vexxsis: your just a degenerate for crying about a game copying another
[1:13:38] Mitune: I so hope there is actual racing
[1:13:46] Molehj: Dragon farts = NOS
[1:13:48] Collected1: i want to hit 88 mph and time travel
[1:13:50] RagingPunk: sounds more fun then just reg flying
[1:13:50] Velashen: Blizzard copied EQ so it is what it is.
[1:13:51] Coriollis: chemtrails confirmed D:
[1:13:55] iitsmadness: so druid flight forms are just disabled? LUL
[1:14:01] duffluv22: FF staff said they played WoW to get better. So why not the reverse???
[1:14:04] mavericks312: when we saw how custimizable the mount was we should have known our mounts werent coming
[1:14:06] bob_the_demon: Seems like adding complexity to something to call it "gameplay"
[1:14:08] Velashen: Regular flying is so bad.
[1:14:13] Collected1: red for me
[1:14:16] Aidler: the dragon flying could pose a problem for people with motion sickness. they still have to think about that
[1:14:19] Stonefather: Strange, they didn't show the DK version where we murder the dragon and raise it Keepo
[1:14:20] Coriollis: red is the best
[1:14:26] SensationalBanana: I wanna go to sleep and sleep until it comes out, thanks.
[1:14:29] Galadeon: Gotta go fast!
[1:14:30] QuigsTV: @towelliee are we gonna find out if Azeroths flat KEKW
[1:14:33] Kraaze21: @Towelliee dragon isles is gonna be a great expac for just getting baked and flying around while doing dailies
[1:14:34] szble: cant wait to ride a dragon as a dragon
[1:14:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Changing dragon armor is cool
[1:14:39] BigJoeChestnut: shake n bake
[1:14:47] Tzarrus: I did like being able to customize your mounts ...that's something they should push for all mounts.  It would definitely set them apart from other games.
[1:14:49] Nostoroth: i dont mind
[1:14:51] Collected1: i think until you hit 70
[1:14:54] raphounzel: like convenant
[1:14:55] audderd: Anyone know why the final fantasy peeps are angry?
[1:15:00] Nostoroth: ign
[1:15:00] Kneckt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKKjtXL6j8
[1:15:01] emznev: hazel
[1:15:01] Leystra: gw2 mounts but also masteries I guess tied to the dragon
[1:15:07] Xaviwan078: i will stay on retail i love the donjon finder
[1:15:24] Galadeon: Grind dragon mount power
[1:15:27] Molitero: hazelnutty did one about crafting
[1:15:28] Vexxsis: @audderd only a hand full are
[1:15:34] Aquadriel: new leakon mmochamp PogChamp
[1:15:40] feherlofia123: expansion wont come uuntil spring 2023
[1:15:53] faulen: Do you think there will be flight paths?
[1:16:00] audderd: @vexxsis ok good I don‚Äôt like beef lol
[1:16:01] Spathotan: @audderd Because the attention has  been taken away from their game and they dont want all the refuges to go back to WoW. FF14 is a great game but the community is on the low toxic as shit
[1:16:02] Galadeon: Oh for sure Q1 2023
[1:16:10] Alepouditsa: renow?
[1:16:14] dimofodi: I don't want this to be implemented all over the game, I like being able to mindlessly fly somewhere.
[1:16:15] mavericks312: becaue you already have a flying mount to start
[1:16:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's all unlocked through the quests, I think
[1:16:24] CipansR_Ayaya: leakege
[1:16:27] Greybeard_ttv: It eventually becomes flying im sure once you train enough
[1:16:30] Mitune: Next expansion already announced
[1:16:32] FallenxGabe: It will be slow at the beginning
[1:16:34] TigasLIVE: https://i.imgur.com/AROZrfh.png This is the real leaker btw @Towelliee
[1:16:35] raphounzel: no new profession tho
[1:16:35] Armdel: we don't know if the november release leak is real yet
[1:16:38] MVRD: 11.0 leaked! PogU Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[1:16:39] Coriollis: next xpack already
[1:16:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Will they timegate actual dragon riding and flying? Maybe
[1:16:50] dimofodi: They said they were looking at future implementation to the rest of the game.
[1:16:51] DragonofWolves: Spathotan It's never been toxic for me, but thats just from what I've seen
[1:17:10] TacDuc: 2021?
[1:17:19] PidiaP: Blink twice if it was Josh who leaked towHesaidit
[1:17:30] vaironixx: he was right on all the other stuff is all im saying
[1:17:32] raye_gaming22: they dont need to test shit
[1:17:36] raye_gaming22: exacly
[1:17:36] Collected1: yeah i wonder if systems are coming in dot patches
[1:17:38] Vexxsis: some good stuff , but im still gonna wait for sure till i actually get excited for it
[1:17:39] lithium364: depends, do we know when the video from yesterday was recorded? maybe the video was done 3 month ago?
[1:17:42] Spathotan: @DragonofWolves Me either but ive seen/read enough to know its no better or worse than the WoW community. Toxic players are everywhere
[1:17:49] Mitune: Do you think they will adjust the Dracthyr models? @Towelliee
[1:17:49] cappei: This guy leaked all the features and leaked a lot of pictures of the expac before the reveal, so yeah. Nov 2022? We will see
[1:17:50] mavericks312: the dragon riding system alone is gonna need some time
[1:17:53] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:17:55] WickedSorrow: The average time between announcement and realse is 391 days. 391 days from Yesterday is May 15th of 2023
[1:17:55] Relic7: Won't they get to a point where everyone loves the new game physics of the Dragon Isles so mucch it will make the rest of Azeroth feel dated?
[1:17:59] dimofodi: If it comes in November that means S3 and S4 in 9.2 are super short and are not the "normal season length" that they said they would be running when announcing S4.
[1:18:00] MrGharr: it seems earlier in development than shadowlands was at announcement :S
[1:18:08] feherlofia123: talents is dope
[1:18:08] Aquadriel: i already reserved Dragundeez and Gargalon names on my server, ready for the exp @Towelliee
[1:18:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: There's still a lot of stuff in Dragonflight to test, many of us expect more systems to be revealed
[1:18:17] mcloveinu716: 2022 LK 2023 new exp
[1:18:17] duffluv22: Im excited for the tree system.
[1:18:22] CipansR_Ayaya: Pog ?
[1:18:24] The_Metal_Man: wrath covers 2022Q4 so I doubt it comes before than, more likely 2023Q1-Q2
[1:18:24] Mitune: timegated versus enjoyable progression lets hope its the latter
[1:18:31] pixxelina: DO IT
[1:18:31] Malnar1123: No they said ‚Äúfrom the beginning‚Äù. The upgrading is what happens overtime at level 70.
[1:18:34] bob2305: Account wide rep please
[1:18:35] raldrik: there is no try only do
[1:18:36] Dirtnose: account wide rep pls
[1:18:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: think they said you have to finish the zone to unlock it, so kinda like ff14 but you don't need to find random currents that we know of
[1:18:39] WoW_StandalonE: 4Head
[1:18:45] mwrath666: Dragonriding probably will be necessary for some sort of new features will be implemented on this Isle, that's why it cannot be used outside of the expansion content
[1:18:51] Sylphy_TV: JUst code it 4Head
[1:19:03] Velashen: Really just depends if it is true that they started the expansion as soon as SL came out.
[1:19:18] mavericks312: which is smart
[1:19:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Centaurs!
[1:19:31] faulen: I want to play as a tuskarr
[1:19:36] Mitune: Dragon riding in terms of the momentum and gliding will probably be a thing going forward into new expansions
[1:19:41] emznev: i amalready playing 10.3 :)
[1:19:42] Kaluma_: Kaluma_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[1:19:47] cappei: The Evokers can do dragon riding with their winged form supposedly
[1:19:51] Armdel: hire more people and code it faster WeSmart
[1:19:52] BlueBeast33: I need an elaboration on what they mean by more in-depth open world content
[1:19:54] Eviltuna13: Otter mounts sacPAT
[1:19:54] feherlofia123: so is dragonriding a gliding feature or just flying with barrel rolls
[1:20:02] Dirtnose: I wonder if they'll up Chromie Time to level 60 or if we will have to do shadowlands 50-60 on every character
[1:20:18] NecroTarkan: Do you feel that there is enough on the box features with this release announcement? Or do you think this felt a little flat. In my opinion I felt they needed more expac features. Maybe its just me.
[1:20:18] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!

[1:20:36] jeflag: where player housing tho
[1:20:44] mavericks312: S-lands could replace BFA as the default leveling zones now
[1:20:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: duck mount or we riot
[1:20:45] Kelbzter: BOP
[1:21:08] joe_theviking: @Towelliee what is the mission table addon you're using?

[1:21:26] Fugazi811: Ion looks good
[1:21:29] Radtvlol: "pretty good" KEKW
[1:21:30] GT_JamesATL: There should definitely be player housing by now
[1:21:38] cevyr1: Player housing is the most tired and boring request from the community
[1:21:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Hazel is cool, I like her
[1:21:44] JWoody82: canadian borrowed
[1:21:45] MrGharr: Ion looked really bad in shadowlands video
[1:21:46] CritcobainTV: Ybarra power? monkaS
[1:21:46] mavericks312: they had to shoot that release video when ion was on a binger looks way different here
[1:21:46] flebbooo: IonJam
[1:21:52] Mitune: other monitors @bingo5555
[1:21:53] Vexxsis: @bingo5555 several screens id imagine
[1:21:53] Collected1: wow ion moves around a lot
[1:22:10] CritcobainTV: IonJAM
[1:22:11] Short_Film: glad Ion got some sleep and a massage. looks much better here. I was worried
[1:22:14] souul_e: ion has one monitor and multiple mirrors around it
[1:22:14] CritcobainTV: IonJam **
[1:22:15] creazyTV: What about the sword? Kappa
[1:22:20] PidiaP: Don‚Äôt roast Hazel‚Äôs Canadian accent
[1:22:22] emznev: Ion does  NOT  have a shit mic for once XD
[1:22:24] zeitgeiz: Didn‚Äôt realize she got an interview. That‚Äôs cool
[1:22:26] its_legendaric: @creazyTV what sword?
[1:22:27] Vexxsis: i just really hope the new talent system works well
[1:22:51] rank1casual: I am most excited about the talent tree rework. I cant stand the current model of talents
[1:23:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: New talents are great
[1:23:11] Vexxsis: @rank1casual same , its boring af
[1:23:15] MrGharr: I'm really hyped for the new talents, i want interrupt on my healers
[1:23:23] SilkeySmooth: 2hd enhancement ion
[1:23:27] haveachub: @rank1casual ive been wanting a version of old talents for so long, since Pandaland i hate current trees
[1:23:43] theszoti: does ion got different colored eyes or am i blind ?
[1:23:50] its_legendaric: yo chat, is now a good time to start with WoW? or should i wait till 10.0?
[1:24:12] cappei: I'd wait for pre patch
[1:24:15] MrGharr: @letssascha better than 9.0, or 9.1
[1:24:15] mavericks312: @letssascha now is a great time to play
[1:24:17] Mitune: now is ok, but prepatch is prob best
[1:24:18] creazyTV: @creazyTV the one in Solitus, noone talks about
[1:24:23] rank1casual: same man, I find it so underwhelming picking new talents. I havent played the game seriously since panda land. Come back once a year to check it out and end up leaving again.
[1:24:25] Alepouditsa: @theszoti well he is of an age maby he have "glasses" and used contacts
[1:24:29] DrakeDuude: i do like it
[1:24:33] Zerksyera: Id say 10.0 , everyone has tier sets. And double lego.
[1:24:34] rank1casual: Very excited at the prospects of hte new xpac

[1:33:28] WayneG947: If I resub is there a way to level my alts that doesn't involve doing the SL story?
[1:33:30] FrankTizzle: They want people to have multiple alts, more play time
[1:33:31] MrGharr: gathering professions should be secondary profs
[1:33:32] FranciscoTheMage: give us 3 at least
[1:33:44] FranciscoTheMage: 2 is gather craft
[1:33:49] Coriollis: imagine how many helms gonna brick :D

[1:34:51] Collected1: get crafting RWF guilds
[1:34:54] cappei: BoP mats from high level content to be used in professions sounds good to me
[1:34:55] TacDuc: The best idea is for getting a mat for the gear from raids, IMO
[1:35:02] emznev: already sounds better than shadowlands kekw XD
[1:35:04] IianaDRK: yeh they did this in tbc. some of the bis items were crafted with drops from the raids. i love that idea
[1:35:08] c0mmander_starscream: Fire Ion
[1:35:10] luckfore: sounds good makes sense
[1:35:12] Orirholim: maybe each profession can choose to make one 291 (ie 9.2 now)
[1:35:17] iamspacemanspiff: iamspacemanspiff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:35:22] FallenxGabe: If I don‚Äôt do raids can I still make the good gear?
[1:35:22] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[1:35:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah crafting was usually shitty in terms of ilvl.....this is a fantastic change
[1:35:27] MrFuzzynuts420: what if i just want to buy my full crafted mythic raid gear and never set foot in raid?! :(
[1:35:29] ItsBorland: BIS mats from dungeon/raid drops sounds GOOD

[1:35:41] flebbooo: yeah this sounds great
[1:35:41] DomDos: it always sounds good....
[1:35:51] WhenMopsAttack: having unique professions adds flavour to each of your classes
[1:35:53] Coriollis: especialy with orders from AH sounds realy interesting , depends on aquisition/execution
[1:35:54] Layercake: farming nethrs and orbs
[1:35:54] PvtHudson093: dirges kicking chimrocks wings
[1:35:57] ZHSpar1an: Pog Raid trash farming recipes
[1:35:58] CipansR_Ayaya: da wae
[1:36:01] cappei: Yeah, the reward when you don't pick gear
[1:36:02] nellko69: why cant they make crafted mythic gear hard to craft in order to make it relevant
[1:36:03] Layercake: *nethers
[1:36:03] ghettolobst3r: Crusader enchantment in OG wow
[1:36:03] Yagr6: M+ 20 recipies
[1:36:07] Collected1: i dont like it because it locks out the best items to only a small percentage of players
[1:36:11] Frank4LuLz: like blood spirit from MOP
[1:36:11] Endin: god knows we dont get gear we need out of the vault LUL
[1:36:15] grumpnamedjosh: Dark iron rep horrors
[1:36:19] FallenxGabe: Casual players will rage
[1:36:20] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee why dont these guys ever appear on your streams...
[1:36:22] ViP3R1988: so you have to grind now to get your pieces
[1:36:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, getting high level mats from the vault as an option is good
[1:36:43] SilkeySmooth: no point to craft if im locked out of it
[1:36:51] breadwilton: great question!
[1:36:54] FrankTizzle: Good
[1:36:55] KaisenSiru: Good.
[1:36:56] thomaspxo: oh
[1:36:57] Rohen86: I'd love if they just made the Creation Catalyst and put that into the Profession system
[1:36:58] haveachub: good
[1:37:00] hikaritd: Good
[1:37:01] IianaDRK: bring back legendary questlines
[1:37:01] WhenMopsAttack: fantastic
[1:37:02] Dyasis: nice

[1:37:15] EscapePlan01: that's good
[1:37:18] raye_gaming22: good
[1:37:20] Coriollis: but is good like lowering barrier to entry into a raid, if they find a good balance grind wise, they might evan dip into the boosting raid market
[1:37:35] Sneakzx: Good
[1:37:37] Orirholim: @CMDR_Abstratus seems like shadowlands was the catalyst to leading to a better wow tbh
[1:37:38] BlueBeast33: Build a lot of those bonuses into talents, yep
[1:37:38] haveachub: not everyone needs a legendary thats like necessary for your class to even function correctly on a high level
[1:37:38] DeanoTV: Sooo if theres no covenant/class hall, no AP, no legendaries..is it just dungeons/raids?
[1:37:39] WhenMopsAttack: i'm so excited for talent point systems again
[1:37:42] Alepouditsa: @fallenxgabe as a casual player i don't realy care for to much ilvl as long as i can kill mosters on a desend time i don't mind. what i mind is having nothing to farm tords
[1:37:44] mrz_as: Clap
[1:37:50] ThePawPaw: legos effect into the Talent Tree
[1:37:52] IianaDRK: Clap
[1:37:54] duffluv22: Too many useless legos
[1:38:01] DomDos: they just understood that without leg its easier to balance the classes.
[1:38:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Talents are better than legendaries, I agree with that
[1:38:10] SilkeySmooth: just keep tier sets to pve
[1:38:10] tigzie: I LOVE that the focus is on classes and not external systems.
[1:38:10] Mitune: Hope they release talent calculators soonish just to let us mess with even if they arent set in stone
[1:38:11] DeanoTV: Soo if theres no covenant/class hall, no AP, no legendaries..is it just dungeons/raids ?
[1:38:16] thiccsushi: YEP

[1:38:21] BlueBeast33: Sounds like they're building them into the talents
[1:38:22] onous_: As of now
[1:38:23] reformedalex12345: i think there will be Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[1:38:24] Nokterian: clearly
[1:38:24] dirtylurker69: yes for now
[1:38:24] MrFuzzynuts420: i like the new-old version of WoW they're going to. you think they finally learned to listen to the players?
[1:38:25] Lexxania: sounds like that
[1:38:26] mrz_as: YEP
[1:38:26] Yagr6: thank god
[1:38:26] Armdel: maybe something from a last boss of a raid ye
[1:38:27] FranciscoTheMage: yea
[1:38:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think some legendaries might drop....but yeah in general no need for those
[1:38:28] belfastcl: their function is replaced by talents, is what he hinted at
[1:38:29] bob_the_demon: He said it
[1:38:29] flebbooo: seems so
[1:38:29] Ortinoth: for now no legendaries
[1:38:30] danimoto10: hmm I dont know how i feel about it
[1:38:31] TacDuc: It could be like MoP or BfA lego
[1:38:32] Sneakzx: Yeah
[1:38:32] FallenxGabe: Feels like they stripping everything to basic level but will they have something in place?
[1:38:35] dracullus: no legiondaries/torghast legos
[1:38:35] Bahamut145: Not in mass no
[1:38:35] FrankTizzle: They might do a one off like BFA cape leggo @Towelliee but not like Legion/SL
[1:38:35] enux337: classic style
[1:38:36] Valhallelujah: back to wrath legendaries
[1:38:36] FranciscoTheMage: he just said no leggos
[1:38:36] IianaDRK: there might be special ones, but not like legion or shadowlands
[1:38:37] xmirrxrs: Yea until next expac
[1:38:39] TheZander: I¬¥d guess akin to MoP?
[1:38:39] FranciscoTheMage: its in the past
[1:38:45] Mecabeast: I think more like a 1 or 2 legos for the expan like old school system for legos
[1:38:46] onous_: No legos off the rip.
[1:38:47] Dyasis: correct
[1:38:48] mavericks312: leggos arent candy anymore
[1:38:49] IianaDRK: yes it sounds that way
[1:38:50] lilwaldo: I think there will be, but it will be very very RNG like it was in TBC or Vanilla.
[1:38:50] luckfore: hope we get a legendary questline again
[1:38:51] SensationalBanana: Thank God...
[1:38:51] FrankTizzle: I miss Maw of Souls grind FeelsBadMan
[1:38:53] KingSlayerYotam: tbh lego acquisition sucks in SL, just expensive gear
[1:38:56] kiroslays: Letssss gooooooo
[1:38:56] spanij: thanks god
[1:38:56] reformedalex12345: i hope we get some tbc like leggos good only for some classess Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[1:38:57] derry10: it might be like the legendary cloak you got in MOP
[1:38:58] Rayzodoom: Legos will be Legos again
[1:39:00] thiccsushi: I'd assume the last boss of the final patch will have a legendary wep or something like sylvanas
[1:39:01] pixxelina: probably just a couple of pieces that drop from bosses?
[1:39:03] Slytha_KEKW: what abound legendaries with extra skill points?
[1:39:04] IianaDRK: maybe legendary will mean something again
[1:39:07] Rayzodoom: and the stuff they have been will be in the talents
[1:39:08] Jaebom_1HP: go back to the burning crusade and wotlk
[1:39:08] hikaritd: not gonna have 500k/lego piece so I will be able to play alts again...
[1:39:09] DeanoTV: So what are we gonna do outside of dungeons/raids/pvp .. ?
[1:39:10] bob_the_demon: If legendary it would only be a one-off item
[1:39:12] Lexxania: i dont think it will be a everyone gets a leggo this time it will be like there are a few special leggos that could drop
[1:39:16] MrGharr: quest legos are cool
[1:39:21] IianaDRK: the mop legendary questlines were was great
[1:39:21] Nokterian: BfA did a good legendary as well with the cloak @Towelliee
[1:39:25] luckfore: yea i like that
[1:39:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: A legendary questling could be cool, sure
[1:39:30] WhenMopsAttack: with the reintroduction of talent point systems, they dont want to over complicate things by having all these systems interact with each other
[1:39:32] TacDuc: Yup, MoP, WoD and BfA(ish)
[1:39:34] spanij: quest legos r so cool
[1:39:34] feherlofia123: am i just weird , i like having no leggos and only baseline gear
[1:39:35] Elindalyne: those systems made me quit mop and wod... there was no good catch up mechanics
[1:39:37] MrGharr: even BFA lego cape was ok
[1:39:39] Armdel: ye i liked MoP's way of doing it
[1:39:40] mayhemguy: i like the old school lego weapons
[1:39:43] Coriollis: 1 lego that is not defying your class/spec is good
[1:39:46] FrankTizzle: @Towelliee Legion Leggos ONLY FELT GOOD WHEN YOU GOT YOUR BIS AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T; SL leggos aren't fun because everyone has them
[1:39:46] nelorixx: yea they were good but not alt friendly peepoSad
[1:39:47] DeanoTV: So what are we gonna do outside of dungeons/raids/pvp ? @Towelliee
[1:39:48] spanij: MOP rocks
[1:39:50] Spathotan: Id rather no more legendaries
[1:39:51] Tizbit: Mop did it well
[1:39:52] FranciscoTheMage: not for dragonflight. he said. no leggo at all @Towelliee
[1:39:52] bob_the_demon: So you want the ring from WoD
[1:39:56] Frank4LuLz: TO MANY LEGOS TBH
[1:39:56] Gillrad: Ion said that legendaries are just borrowed power that can be consolidated into talent trees, which is great that they're learning that
[1:39:58] SensationalBanana: MoP's legendary was amazing.
[1:39:58] danimoto10: thats crazy
[1:39:58] MrFuzzynuts420: yup
[1:40:00] Yagr6: enhance better have a 2hander skill in the tree
[1:40:02] FallenxGabe: They will probably add a leggo later in expac for weakest performing class
[1:40:02] reggiepowa: covenant powers looked cooler than talent tree tbh
[1:40:02] tebbix: legendaries doesn't feel legendary anymore
[1:40:03] Deex93: the staff from cata was awesome
[1:40:03] Jollywhompus: I don't mind legendaries, but when a legendary creates a whole new socket system with 30+ options and each patch the one you maxed out gets nerfed. Thats the problem
[1:40:05] onous_: It seems like they're trying to go back to an easier way to balance IMO.
[1:40:05] Alegnowar: that's good, becouse they can build upon it in the future
[1:40:06] Deex93: and the daggers
[1:40:06] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii

[1:40:16] phantumtheory: teracgosa staff was a gr8 quest line
[1:40:16] Alienn07: just dont delte 90% of game each patch pls
[1:40:19] dimofodi: The good news is we won't need to ask them to pull the ripcord on Talent Trees. @Towelliee
[1:40:20] Mitune: @JagrZero and tank stuff lol
[1:40:21] Rayzodoom: and your gonna have to choose haha
[1:40:21] Galadeon: Yeah, the MOP cloak was a good system.
[1:40:22] mrz_as: monkaS
[1:40:23] flebbooo: Meaningful choice monkaS
[1:40:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that's the point, you can't choose them all.....you pick your loadout for what you want to do
[1:40:25] thomaspxo: I liked having two talent trees.one built into class one built into gear. glad it went back but I was fine with it.
[1:40:26] Ortinoth: it could be since they are going back to the 'roots' i think its a good idea not to keep doing borrowed power
[1:40:27] Coriollis: here we go PepeLaugh
[1:40:29] PokerFaceMoose: right now it is evergreen mechanic but if everyone hates it does it become this xpacs system
[1:40:31] abracka_: hope prot paladin keeps divine toll
[1:40:34] raye_gaming22: like i said i have seen 3 lego effrects on the druid tree
[1:40:34] FranciscoTheMage: EVOKERS

[1:40:40] Velashen: Just look at SL systems.. there you can find problems lol
[1:40:41] FranciscoTheMage: not INVOKERS
[1:40:46] Armdel: there was footage of them gliding like demon hunters can
[1:40:48] propwash80: @Towelliee i love the talent tree stuff, i used to run w/ a ret/holy pally in grps and ret/prot when i ran solo, look forward to that
[1:40:50] FallenxGabe: Legendaries built into skill tree
[1:40:55] WhenMopsAttack: my dragon is going to have colourful streamers and a bell
[1:40:55] Jollywhompus: Biggest issue I have is spending hours and literal hundred of thousands on gold to see that work need to be replaced the next patch
[1:40:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think Divine Toll is probably staying, with Convoke and similar ones
[1:40:55] hikaritd: DH PLAYERS IN SHAMBLES LUL
[1:40:58] Aidler: @towelliee the danger is. that is of course a single point of failure if they don‚Äôt do it right
[1:41:07] TompsonX: i want the Twilight Devestation talent tree LUL
[1:41:11] Dirtnose: LUL
[1:41:11] tydrennistv: Too be honest this is blizzard giving the players what they want. Old trees, crazy systems, or borrowed power if players don‚Äôt like then it‚Äôs the player base fault because they asked for years

[1:46:27] TheEmperor30k: why does it have to be in just the xpac? put a house area in the cities
[1:46:27] FallenxGabe: It‚Äôs true but you have to start at least
[1:46:27] athedusgrimwilde: They could release the expansions in reverse for housing, starting with dragon expansion
[1:46:28] Rayzodoom: it's really sad that a company as big as blizzard can't find the resources for housing but every other mmo can. lame excuse
[1:46:28] Lexxania: alright time to move out!

[1:46:36] Colly_UK: housing has to be at faction capitals...
[1:46:36] mavericks312: there is no lawyer talk from ion this interview its kinda refreshing
[1:46:38] SensationalBanana: I don't think housing will happen until a big old world revamp, tbf.
[1:46:38] Oriqqs: why does it have to be expansion themed to be introduced in an expansion?
[1:46:38] jerexify: Racially themed, or class themed, not expansion themed.
[1:46:38] lowlifepuppet1: ufly
[1:46:39] Alepouditsa: i will still keep hopping for player houseing danCry
[1:46:40] wolvenhunt: yes u order movers, let's go

[1:47:06] FallenxGabe: The longer they put it off the longer it‚Äôs gonna take
[1:47:07] KaisenSiru: A very delicate feature that must be done right
[1:47:08] ObsidianHealer: if they want to do player housing, they need to play a bit of FF14 and check those out.
[1:47:10] belfastcl: props to mmos who have managed to get housing in
[1:47:10] Cal_Kat: Needs to be like an inn in main city you "zone" into and takes you to your personal house that you can then just change as customizations come out
[1:47:13] OGSceneBoy: Player housing is a huge feature, ALOT of work goes into incorporating it, I think alot of people who want it don't really know that. Û†ÄÄ
[1:47:13] Dirtnose: Best way would be what Ion said, just do it slowly over multiple expansions. Add more as time goes on and fill it out
[1:47:18] CipansR_Ayaya: there is garrision
[1:47:20] Ghost5392: @cmonseriously WoW also has way more content than eso though.

[1:54:55] Yagr6: u will miss out on some trinkets when they swap out some dungeons
[1:55:01] ventu105: @Towelliee I give you my Prime ty for the Info about WoW
[1:55:01] Coriollis: depends how many patches we will get
[1:55:04] danimoto10: he said that he realese the game with all the 8
[1:55:06] thiccsushi: Season 3 maybe they add 4 more new ones? Like legion adding 2 each patch?
[1:55:08] mavericks312: he did say were getting 8 new dungeons at launch
[1:55:08] IianaDRK: u need to keep in mind the meta achievement. 16 dungeons on both affixes is 32 dungeons
[1:55:09] Ortinoth: i doubt we get 16 new dungeions maybe 8
[1:55:10] SilkeySmooth: i would assume they would just recycle the 8
[1:55:14] danimoto10: but only 4 of them are m+ in S1
[1:55:16] MrGharr: 8 dungeon is ok for 1 season, but we need way more over 2 years
[1:55:17] Orirholim: 4 new + 4 old each season maybe?
[1:55:19] waterdust619: 2 mega dungeons would give 4 more
[1:55:20] Bernardo994: your always a ten to me
[1:55:22] mavericks312: were getting 8 dungeons at launch
[1:55:24] IianaDRK: a rotation of 8 id be happy with
[1:55:26] Layercake: We will get 8 at release
[1:55:29] FallenxGabe: That‚Äôs wishful thinking we gonna have 8 for sure 4 at the beginning and 4 later
[1:55:29] PvtHudson093: S3 take 2 from s1 and 2 from s2
[1:55:33] S1appadabass: what if a bis item is not in the rotation for an entire season?
[1:55:36] Jamertamer: COPIUM 16
[1:55:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: 16 dungeons sounds sweet
[1:55:42] playmoretv: that would be a mistake. People complaint that there is no variety, and they will keep restricting to have 8 mythics per patch and 4 old ones ...
[1:55:45] TompsonX: We get 8, it's just M+ is 4 + 4 old ones
[1:55:46] yaashs: Im not so sure about the MoP dungeons though, they are kinda outdated
[1:55:47] KaptnG: Tier sets each raid again?
[1:55:47] MrGharr: 16 dungeons, i'd be fine with
[1:55:52] Coriollis: I hope they DO NOT make a megadungeon because it will get split and get skipped most of time , look at tazevesh
[1:55:52] Mitune: Did you see they are doing an updated Uldaman for the prepatch ? @Towelliee
[1:55:55] QuigsTV: @towelliee Idk how I feel about the dungeon thing personally. I‚Äôd like for 8 dungeons with 2 or 4 from previous expacs on a rotation.
[1:55:59] Sandisy: @S1appadabass, then it is no longer bis
[1:56:00] huh_pickle: can someone link that interview video?
[1:56:02] faulen: everyone is learning
[1:56:02] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee when we think back to vanilla. how many dungeons were at release. there were a whole bunch
[1:56:03] ewoksmoonwalks: season 3 would most likely be the first 4 dragonflight dungeons then 4 old dungeons that werent in the first 2 seasons
[1:56:05] ZHSpar1an: 16 dungueons in m+ is gonna be painful for casuals
[1:56:07] mavericks312: were getting 8 new dungeons at launch M+ is only 4 each season
[1:56:14] faulen: Everyone learns at the same time
[1:56:14] Negima_a: only thing im worried about in 4 season 1 and 4 season 2 then what if your bis is season 2 dungeon pool you are just fucked for season 1
[1:56:17] danimoto10: maybe we need to push that all the 8 dungeons will be avilable in m+ during s1 with 4 old dungeons
[1:56:17] WhenMopsAttack: maybe the goal was always to convert older dungeons into m+ this is just a good time to do it
[1:56:18] Orirholim: @Coriollis they probably wont ever make mega dungeons again
[1:56:18] Elindalyne: loot gets boring with the current system
[1:56:19] nibarry: Its not overwhelming its just boring AF doing the same 8 dungeons all xpac
[1:56:19] thorined: People who didnt play the old dungeons have to learn the old dungeons too
[1:56:19] Dewars: release 8 new ones and keep adding 2 new + 2 old each patch
[1:56:21] MarquisLek: its equal footing for the new guys in the season
[1:56:23] waterdust619: Good system if they use older dungeons from MOP, WOD, Cata, WoTLK,...
[1:56:24] S1appadabass: @Sandisy LUL True
[1:56:24] raye_gaming22: not overwelming but borring grding plauegefall for 2 years
[1:56:25] Thoreya: it should be like 6 man
[1:56:25] Truthseeker96: 4 new dungeons weekly that you have to learn
[1:56:27] Thoreya: 4 is too low
[1:56:29] thiccsushi: @huh_pickle check her youtube hazelnuttygames
[1:56:30] BrotherBeezy: Not sure I want to know the mechanics for every dungon and raid in the game
[1:56:30] Skydivenaked: I would like to see more dungeons being tied to the raid or have like the same theme as the raid, i loved the ICC dungeons tbh
[1:56:31] IianaDRK: its boring imo. in the older expansions we just flat out got new dungeons during the patches. whereas since m+ we just have the launch dungeons for 2 years
[1:56:34] FallenxGabe: Wait to see what‚Äôs in beta then we‚Äôll now what‚Äôs going on
[1:56:43] Eziak: I don‚Äôt think overwhelming is the right argument, I think the better argument is that it gets boring and this will spice it up
[1:56:44] danimoto10: yes exactly
[1:56:46] Alexkayzz: Yeah that sounds better
[1:56:47] DeanoTV: @Towelliee u think casuals wont be happy with no new systems? just dungeons/raids/pvp ?
[1:56:47] FallenxGabe: *know
[1:56:48] huh_pickle: @thiccsushi thank you
[1:56:51] Dogjah: they didn't mention anything about making old content relevant
[1:56:52] dright424: I think the goal is too make it so its a new set of learning every season
[1:56:53] AMDFusion: @Thoreya its 8 dungeon, 4 new + 4 old
[1:56:55] Sprowa: if old dungeons aren't from legion/bfa/shadowlands I think it's fine
[1:56:56] TheNoidd: M+ Ragefire Chasm
[1:56:56] Coriollis: @Orirholim concept is cool for a small 10 man raid but brand new is alot of resources for small interest
[1:56:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wailing Caverns mythic+!!
[1:56:57] mavericks312: god please no BRD
[1:56:59] ewoksmoonwalks: screw it lets go all 8 all seasons plus all the old dungeons have a 50 dungeon mythic + pool
[1:56:59] yaashs: Stratholme!!
[1:56:59] Tizbit: It‚Äôs so you learn them together tho lol I think you missed the point maybe
[1:56:59] Dirtnose: Who voted for Grimrail LUL
[1:57:01] Sabrius_: PLEASE not grimrail depot lol
[1:57:02] SK1NFATHER: These talents might help with M+ burnout a lot. Even if it's with the same dungeons for a while.
[1:57:04] JansonLives: It's gonna suck when one of the new dungeons has a piece of loot that is BIS for you and its not in the rotation.
[1:57:04] onous_: Classic M+ Dungeons
[1:57:05] andrewmb01: yes you have to learn 4 new dungeons but EVERYONE has to
[1:57:05] FranciscoTheMage: GOD NO
[1:57:06] FranciscoTheMage: pls
[1:57:07] raye_gaming22: grinding PF every tier for trinekt is madness
[1:57:11] edeasknight: M+ wailing caverns
[1:57:12] Goatsguffle: Grimrail with sanguine.....
[1:57:12] Thoreya: @AMDFusion should be more than 4 new dungeons. like 6
[1:57:14] Coldlight1: most of the re-made oldschool dungeons were a lot of fun
[1:57:15] OneMagicPickle: I think mixing it up is be great fun tho
[1:57:16] Fugazi811: no vote because people just troll Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[1:57:18] cruzeal: don't vote grimrail towRage
[1:57:19] ObsidianHealer: M+ RFC KEKW
[1:57:26] Balkep: Iron Docks extended edition Kappa
[1:57:26] Korobeez: The old dungeons content will add some spice for sure
[1:57:27] Dirtnose: Gonna be fucking awful in M+, Iron Docks has more potential though
[1:57:28] onous_: RFC M+
[1:57:29] Ogumel: I'm so glad Grimrail won.
[1:57:29] lithium364: Halls of Origination pepelaugh 65 min timer pepelaugh
[1:57:29] 91Niki: WHO ARE WE?!
[1:57:30] Sore1: he talked about grinding out the same loot too across an entire expac
[1:57:30] uawildcat04: @Towelliee it just seems like there is nothinig to look forward too. Just the same ol same ol
[1:57:30] jerexify: @Dirtnose Me, unfortunately. I didn't do hardly any WoD dungeons, and people told me to vote for that one.
[1:57:31] pereadin: Everything sounds very promising thiugh
[1:57:32] SilkeySmooth: m+ brd
[1:57:32] IianaDRK: they could be taking a page from ff14s book where they keep old dungeons relevant at max level. if we get vanilla + any expansion dungeon as potential m+ then thatd be awesome
[1:57:32] MammothGB: Karazhan will be back Kappa
[1:57:33] MetalManGG: Blackfathom Deeps would be cool
[1:57:34] QuigsTV: Siege of Boralus is back LUL
[1:57:35] Bennodkk: Grimrail was legit best wod dungeon no joke
[1:57:36] fistofnature: M+ deadmines? POGGERS
[1:57:38] HokmanTV: We get what we deserve on votes
[1:57:38] im_n0t_jezus: im fine with no leggos
[1:57:42] raye_gaming22: i voeted for everbloom and mines
[1:57:43] maalow: +30 RFC at MDI KEKW
[1:57:43] Dewars: why cant be there a cloak or something?
[1:57:46] tebbix: oh no siege of boralus
[1:57:47] onous_: Stockade M+
[1:57:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: M+ RFC would be like a 10 minute 3 chest LUL
[1:57:52] Nokterian: @Towelliee the new dragonflight will be faster than the current flying speed of the mounts we have now
[1:57:57] Rastailian: has there been any talk about more race/class combos? (like nelf paladins)
[1:58:01] ZetYokai: yeah casuals will quit fast
[1:58:01] Collected1: the suggestion that housing would limit resources for other stuff is a strange concept to me for a company as big as blizzard
[1:58:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: For the casuals, they just want to keep up...it looks like they will have an easier time keeping up
[1:58:04] devilhawk83: I am fine with Iron Docks, but Grimrail is going to be a instant skip
[1:58:05] TommyGachi: I'm casual and the systems are why I quit
[1:58:06] Radtvlol: no systems and no borrowed power is a good thing.
[1:58:07] Poiuykk66: Would challenge modes ever be a thing again like mop ? They need to add some cool transmog stuff for M+ like what you could of got in mop @towelliee
[1:58:07] FrankTizzle: true
[1:58:09] pereadin: M+ Maraudon inc? KEKW
[1:58:09] Velashen: Na lol
[1:58:10] SK1NFATHER: That's fine. It's just WoW then.
[1:58:10] HaloS23: @Towelliee I'm a casual. I'm Happy!
[1:58:13] metallicv12: i do like the revamps and everything but i feel like theres gonna be no content endgame @Towelliee
[1:58:16] Bennodkk: can we stop caring about casual players? they should be happy they have smth to play
[1:58:17] invisiblematter: there are kinda new systems tho
[1:58:18] FrankTizzle: There are a bunch of people now saying they miss BFA @Towelliee
[1:58:18] Korobeez: Love the direction
[1:58:20] Pvt_Cornflower: I am SO happy they didn‚Äôt point to a new system
[1:58:24] PipTown: i think the opposite.... having it simpler is better for casuals instead of needing 40 hrs a week to farm power for all the extra systems
[1:58:28] Dewars: borrowed power is not the only way to make progression exciting
[1:58:29] R0NGG: there is borrowed power tho.. tier sets.. why ppl saying there is none??
[1:58:30] barshorckle: borrowed power/systems aren't inherently bad. It's always the implementation
[1:58:31] KingSpud91: Honestly the WoW community complains more than any other community in gaming.
[1:58:31] JumpTroopC5: I am casual and I am happy except for no housing or garrison system but I can live with it
[1:58:31] Korobeez: Base systems is huge
[1:58:34] Kindosar: Casual is a really broad term, I consider myself casual, but its because I don't raid.  -- Someone I consider casual wouldn't be upset by a lack of system, at least on average...
[1:58:34] 91Niki: What do you mean no new systems? There is the whole dragon flight thing. I mean I get there isn't really a power related new thing. But eh, I am okay with it . Me <-- casual
[1:58:35] Specsifier: those people aren't real KEKW
[1:58:40] ZHSpar1an: 10 dungeuons in entires expansion are fine
[1:58:40] kiro2k: I really loved Artifact weapons, that was a good system
[1:58:41] bypized: @Towelliee when was borrowed power first introduced? We havent had a break since?
[1:58:42] reformedalex12345: well they did sustain people in tbc wotlk etc and there was no borrow power there LUL
[1:58:43] Dogjah: Collected1- I agree 100%
[1:58:43] Arocian: If they give more dungeons and raids
[1:58:45] Vedros_: It sounds like the zones itself will have lots to explore
[1:58:45] Rayzodoom: but let's not doing housing lmao
[1:58:46] raye_gaming22: they will add patch powers he said that
[1:58:48] Mamorse: wait i am catching up right now, no burrowed power or systems?
[1:58:49] FallenxGabe: If this expansion doesn‚Äôt have casual content it‚Äôs gonna be disastrous for the game
[1:58:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Casuals aren't going to have to farm legendaries or grind the shit out of power
[1:58:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: give me things to do but dont make me log on every day to gather power
[1:58:52] greenmanalpha: im casual af and im hella excited for power being in the talents
[1:58:54] coldhandsbeatz: No systems/borrowed power should mean way more outdoor content, new and regular content expanded
[1:58:55] cruzeal: rip essences
[1:58:56] Rayzodoom: literally the easiest thing to give people stuff to do
[1:58:56] raye_gaming22: yea
[1:58:59] Vezri96: shards of domination KEKW
[1:59:00] Sephiroht: Sephiroht subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 121 months, currently on a 121 month streak! towHAMUP
[1:59:10] onybear: Your never going to make everyone happy‚Ä¶you can give some one a million dollars and they would complain it was t a billion
[1:59:11] Truthseeker96: So wait how are ppl gonna run Mythic dungeons from old expansions that didnt have Mythic? There wasn't any groups forming for world tour for legion timewalking last week? so how are new players gonna learn these old dungeons for M+ difficulty?
[1:59:15] MarquisLek: those are the good ones
[1:59:17] denflup: leggos 10.3 then?
[1:59:18] Mecabeast: like azerite
[1:59:19] Arocian: They should bump up dungeon and raid content, even if spread over the entire expansion, released in phases
[1:59:24] Velashen: Zone systems will still be around
[1:59:27] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee what did preach have to say.. heard anything? did he like it?
[1:59:27] Clicklesly: Technically you can look at each tier as borrowed power too ^^
[1:59:27] Dewars: essences though
[1:59:30] BlueBeast33: what sword?
[1:59:33] flebbooo: What sword? LUL
[1:59:34] bukka_hot: sword ??
[1:59:34] waterdust619: What sword???
[1:59:35] Pvt_Cornflower: Good riddance
[1:59:35] Mitune: What sword?
[1:59:36] FallenxGabe: It‚Äôs gonna be in talent trees
[1:59:37] humm1ng: what sword?
[1:59:41] Kindosar: @truthseeker96 by doing them
[1:59:41] Coriollis: u know Ion also said Shadowlands will be fun , so take it with a grain of salt xD
[1:59:44] Bennodkk: i'm happy no leggos for dragonflight
[1:59:47] WhenMopsAttack: we'll be rep farming for the dragon flights
[1:59:48] NEMERL: @towelliee they should focus more on tune and balance the classes instead od balance borrowed powers
[1:59:48] Jollywhompus: Oh that massive sword they left in the crater?
[1:59:52] Ghost5392: @truthseeker96 By doing them like everybody else lol
[1:59:53] TiredCarcass: sword is a tourist atraction
[1:59:58] MarquisLek: like SoD rune
[1:59:59] KingSpud91: Give me a boss fight where I can use my dragon mount!
[1:59:59] reformedalex12345: well they did sustain people in tbc wotlk etc and there was no borrow power there LUL Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[2:00:00] Orirholim: @truthseeker96 ingame dungeon guide, youtube, wowhead guides, plenty of places to learn a dungeon
[2:00:04] cryft: no more zone specific powers please
[2:00:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is some kind of thing with dragon empowered pieces, they said limited to 2
[2:00:11] Jollywhompus: @Towelliee are you dissapointed that you can't pick multiple class specific talent trees
[2:00:19] Pvt_Cornflower: Illusion of choice matters
[2:00:20] Pey0: Does the 4 + 4 make getting new max level gear out of a dungeon ot possible if it's not part of season 1?
[2:00:22] AinaTan3: yo dawg I heard you like talents trees LUL
[2:00:22] tydrennistv: I‚Äôm curious how the talent trees will work. People like that wow isn‚Äôt super button heavy now
[2:00:25] pereadin: Talent trees will make or break the expansion
[2:00:25] onous_: The return of FrostBlood tanks .
[2:00:27] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee why are we only seeing the DRUID tree so far
[2:00:28] cappei: Good. We needed a focus on baseline class design/talents. Classes have felt dull as shit for the last few expacs
[2:00:33] bypized: @Towelliee the talent trees its probably what will delay the game the most because of testing
[2:00:43] waterdust619: Because fewer systems it will be easier to ballance
[2:00:44] Coriollis: looking forward to see their alpha build thats for sure
[2:00:44] racketpunch: Bring back warrior glad spec
[2:00:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tier set acquisition is likely the hardest part
[2:00:47] tebbix: I hope the tier sets look as great in game as the concept art
[2:00:55] FallenxGabe: They better work on balancing or it‚Äôs gonna be a shitshow
[2:00:56] ItsBorland: warrior glad spec
[2:00:58] Truthseeker96: @Kindosar yeah good advice lemme go form group for mythic shado-pan monastery and see how many will actually q
[2:00:59] SK1NFATHER: I hope there's no cookie-cutter builds. I want those nodes in the trees to do something viable and cool
[2:01:01] motorboatingpro: do you think we'll see heart of azeroth powers? i kind of miss neckbeam
[2:01:03] 91Niki: @Towelliee people with the dragon slayer title arriving at the dragon isles https://i.redd.it/yak6fox49ou81.jpg LUL
[2:01:05] thiccsushi: My only gripe is having to use a talent point for interrupts and decurse. That should just be baseline
[2:01:08] faulen: The hexagon shaped one also let you change the ability.
[2:01:08] SeedySandwich: @Towelliee What do you think about having a farm back? like in MOP?
[2:01:10] TheodredCaelzara: i like ions idea to put the work in progress talents before alpha for testing
[2:01:14] HaloS23: @Towelliee Clarify: its 60 points between the 2 trees or 60 per?
[2:01:18] FranciscoTheMage: how many POINTS do we get.. how much do they COST @Towelliee
[2:01:19] ElDrakenMan: @Towelliee do you have any plans to go back to alliance or are you liking Horde?
[2:01:20] Radtvlol: @91Niki OMEGALUL
[2:01:29] Truthseeker96: @Kindosar shado-pan monastery doesnt even have mythic difficulty yet
[2:01:32] pereadin: The talent trees are setup with a baseline class general tree and then the spec specific trees.
[2:01:34] MOLAR305: I'm digging the lack of borrowed power
[2:01:35] metallicv12: i feel like theres not gonna enough content at 70 tbh but i do like the revamps @Towelliee
[2:01:38] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee yo, i just started doin more tanking on my pally, what potency conduits do you use?
[2:01:40] Kindosar: @truthseeker96 by doing them... when the m+ are live. you learn new dungeons when theyr'e released the same way.
[2:01:46] brewsuadeshoes: Defender of a Shattered World
[2:01:50] thatguynamedjans: I know this quest doesnt take too long anyways, but you know you can open those fissures from your flying mount while in midair? then you dont have to fight anything lol
[2:01:53] QueueUp: @thiccsushi Not really bad because you get enough points for it to not matter? It also should allow healers to have interrupts
[2:01:55] PawgersHC: do you think a third spec for envoker will come late in the expansion for black dragonflight?
[2:01:55] Armdel: yeah and Dragonslayer also happens to be my favorite title üò∂
[2:01:56] Poiuykk66: People saying there‚Äôs not gonna be enough content .. what do you guys want in the game?üòÇ
[2:01:59] Kindosar: @truthseeker96 no need for running a normal mythic to learn when you can run a mythic +2 which is the same thing
[2:01:59] tydrennistv: I wonder if there will be all passive options
[2:02:05] FrankTizzle: Yea
[2:02:06] FranciscoTheMage: I LIKE the fact they are ditching REP friendly honored revered ETC @Towelliee THANK GOD. time to ditch all that
[2:02:10] ninacomesinpeace: I'm glad there is no borrowed powers or legendaries
[2:02:14] Orirholim: @metallicv12 meh, there's stuff they probably haven't announced yet that they left out of the deep dive
[2:02:16] mrrazputin: i realy dont like that new race... im afraid it will be DK and DH again super broken
[2:02:16] FallenxGabe: It‚Äôs capped
[2:02:17] FrankTizzle: I bet you will have the same number of active buttons now
[2:02:17] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: are you worried that the talents are just a re-skin, and not new talents? @Towelliee
[2:02:19] ItsBorland: I really love the dragon theme. dragons are as fantasy as it gets
[2:02:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah there are choices with the talents, can't have them all
[2:02:25] mavericks312: i wouldnt be suprised if say mages had to choose between time warp and icy veins
[2:02:27] Ortinoth: there i think is going to be several different 'builds' to have
[2:02:27] WhenMopsAttack: one side of the tree is your base class abilities and the other is spec spacific
[2:02:28] Ghost5392: @truthseeker96 But you could form it for a base m+2 and you'd get tons of apps if the content was out. It is the same way with Legion timewalking. People don't generally like to waste time in m0s because 2s are barely harder and reward more.
[2:02:32] Dinokaze: The question is will I get to go back to galactic guardian and be a laser bear again
[2:02:45] tydrennistv: Do you think will get the talent trees in pre patch?
[2:02:45] metavahn231: whoa they copied classic
[2:02:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: The icons looked similar
[2:02:50] lithium364: dark simulacrum in PVE again MonkaS
[2:02:52] tebbix: hopefully they do a cool pre-patch event too
[2:02:55] Hestert: i wonder when the next deep dive will be to announce the deluxe edition
[2:02:55] 91Niki: @Towelliee this one is great too. The game devs on the sword https://i.imgur.com/Ev5d7VN.png LUL
[2:02:58] Mitune: If they listen to feedback about things turning super cookie cutter then I think things will go well @Towelliee
[2:02:58] Orirholim: @Ghost5392 hell, just do Mythic 0 , plenty of people run those too for a chance at specific gear they are targeting
[2:02:59] joeyshades101: Thank god we have a chance to have Convoke one of the coolest abilities
[2:03:07] theloppylobster: conduits=new talents
[2:03:09] tdpark_: are they going to redesign any class/spec?
[2:03:09] WhenMopsAttack: @elixirfield1 MOP is when they changed it to what it is now
[2:03:10] TommyGachi: I hope they blend the specs together a bit more
[2:03:13] Anbean: any info on when they aim to release the expantion? i assume late 2023
[2:03:13] JediNeo99999: Pally better get divine toll
[2:03:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah we have to really dig in to see what they all do
[2:03:16] Gingerprimer: They can also just be reused assets
[2:03:17] Ginbarlo: how u feel about the ui
[2:03:19] Amarlian: @tebbix They did confirm a prepatch event I think it was 2 weeks prior
[2:03:21] Ortinoth: @elixirfield1 they didn't copy classic at all - talent trees where changed in mop
[2:03:23] Alexkayzz: I hope new talents have new icons, one thing I don't like in wow is the reusing of icons a lot
[2:03:40] Elindalyne: i just hope the specs feel ok without talents... If you can super fuck up your build and feel awful it's going to turn off a lot of more casual players
[2:03:44] 91Niki: KEKW
[2:03:48] its_legendaric: what sword?
[2:03:49] FrankTizzle: no way
[2:03:50] bypized: @Towelliee wrath classic is confirmed coming this year, then theyll also have to fit in 9.2.5, which they wont clash? Will? then alpha, then beta, then the prepatch will hit, then the expansion, we only have 8 months left in the year lmao and you think thats all gonna happen??
[2:03:51] MILESkg21: KEKW
[2:03:52] QuigsTV: @towelliee paladins better get Devine toll.
[2:03:52] FergusCreative: How has no one asked in an interview yet
[2:03:53] denflup: what sword
[2:03:55] FrankTizzle: that's going to be there until Sargeras returns
[2:03:55] joe_g_433: When do you think we see alpha?
[2:03:55] WhenMopsAttack: it's got a purpose still, you'll know
[2:03:57] TiredCarcass: a tourist atraction
[2:03:58] Mitune: Never acknowledge that it was even
[2:03:58] ForklyftTV: What Sword?
[2:03:59] MammothGB: Let Magni pull it out by himself
[2:04:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol sword gone wut
[2:04:00] Arocian: The great mystery, what happened to the giant sword
[2:04:01] Orirholim: @Anbean Q1 2023, no way it's late 2023
[2:04:01] CipansR_Ayaya: what sword what you talking about ?
[2:04:03] KingSlayerYotam: the bid bad of 13.0 took the sword
[2:04:03] mctwist__: The Goblins stole it!
[2:04:03] amax_plays: they are focusing the talent system to be like hybrid specs in wotlk
[2:04:04] FrankTizzle: It's going to be Sargeras that will remove the sword
[2:04:05] Aelissia: azeroth absorbs it
[2:04:05] TommyGachi: sword? what sword?
[2:04:06] BlueBeast33: Don't even know what sword you're talking about
[2:04:07] 91Niki: @Towelliee MATE! Do you know what happens if you remove a knife from a stabbing wound???? monkaS
[2:04:08] Rayzodoom: what sword?
[2:04:09] pavepawns: What sword? theres no sword
[2:04:10] SilkeySmooth: do a silithis sit in...lol
[2:04:11] dimofodi: Remove it and when you talk to him, he just says "what sword? there was no sword here"
[2:04:12] Kindosar: make it a mystery lol
[2:04:14] ForklyftTV: Theres a Sword?
[2:04:15] Lexxania: you can go back in time in that location and not see it lol
[2:04:15] CritcobainTV: Imagine they just remove it and then al the "What sword" memes make sense @Towelliee  KEKW
[2:04:15] Yagr6: ashen?
[2:04:17] faulen: I better get grabby hands.
[2:04:20] ItsBorland: @Anbean early 2023 imo
[2:04:20] TacDuc: The dragons planted a new world tree at the sword, and now it's growing there and healing the world
[2:04:20] grumpnamedjosh: what sword Kappa
[2:04:20] FallenxGabe: It will be removed when she wakes up
[2:04:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: The DK's want to keep slappy hands
[2:04:24] Eziak: I assume it will be removed by the dragons this expac. They said they‚Äôre ‚Äúhealing Azeroth‚Äù.
[2:04:29] FranciscoTheMage: but it doesnt make sense.. the sword is holding in the wound. you cant yank things out of wounds without almost killing someone.. thats what it is..
[2:04:30] Eziak: We better get divine toll
[2:04:31] Choopa73: Shamans's don't have a best one
[2:04:33] PvtHudson093: DT goes B O N G
[2:04:33] Clicklesly: But what about Blessing of Season? Kappa
[2:04:35] Dinokaze: @Towelliee The convoke examples was a choice, I'm betting each spec is going to get to choose their covenant ability going forward in the form of a talent, but can only choose one
[2:04:37] thiccsushi: DK's 100% will get slappy hands that shit is iconic
[2:04:41] SilkeySmooth: chain harvest for enhancement shaman please
[2:04:42] raldrik: Dragon Isles feels like a setup expansion for a bigger revamp for the 20th in 2024
[2:04:44] Xeral187: @Towelliee i havent played since castle nath. is it worth coming back now or should i wait till new exp?
[2:04:45] ObsidianHealer: Its just back to the way it was before the sword was there KEKW some Bronze dragon shenanigans
[2:04:45] Pwncakee: Ashen hallow gonna be 100% holy pal talent
[2:04:46] bypized: @Towelliee wrath classic is confirmed coming this year, then theyll also have to fit in 9.2.5, which they wont clash? Will? then alpha, then beta, then the prepatch will hit, then the expansion, we only have 8 months left in the year lmao and you think thats all gonna happen??
[2:04:46] SyRr82: @Towelliee whats gonna happen with all the old mounts, nobody's gonna use them?
[2:04:47] 91Niki: Removing a knife from a stab wound is when shit hits the fan monkaS you can't JUST remove the sword
[2:04:48] Bware2: or ashen hollow?
[2:04:49] viresinnumeris: iconic
[2:04:49] raye_gaming22: ashen lol
[2:04:57] pereadin: As long as they rebuff holy Paladin damage to make up for the removal of ashen I‚Äôll be happy.
[2:04:59] WhenMopsAttack: they'll take some abilities from the "borrowed" power systems into the talen tree's eventually over time
[2:05:04] AveragePvp: I want dks to keep the necro talent because they will cry real tears if they don‚Äôt get it
[2:05:09] pereadin: I wanna see legion h pal damage scaling return
[2:05:13] Mitune: I think we may see some enhancment shaman rework if they do anything that allows for offtanking or 2h, but thats me on COPIUM
[2:05:14] Lunarr0: i just want frost dk to be good
[2:05:14] MammothGB: I really want to keep elysian decree (or maybe a fel version) for DH
[2:05:14] macanudo17: Slappy. Hands.
[2:05:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: @91Niki magni has to be ready to heal the woons
[2:05:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Divine toll is badass for paladin healers
[2:05:24] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee will Wrath classic release same as EXPAC or before EXPAC
[2:05:29] FallenxGabe: It‚Äôs great for everything
[2:05:30] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY

[2:05:51] bypized: Sorry
[2:05:51] Drugovitch: i think the hunt fits the demon hunter more
[2:05:53] Eziak: The hunt is better
[2:05:54] Senthius09: i think dh will keep the hunt
[2:05:55] raye_gaming22: it dont fitt the theme is arcane
[2:06:00] FallenxGabe: Any chance for wrath+
[2:06:02] WhenMopsAttack: wrath has a date for 2022
[2:06:04] Aquadriel: wrath OMEGALUL
[2:06:05] Alexkayzz: Wait isn't the exapnsion tomorrow?
[2:06:05] Domini1001: @Towelliee  if rogues keep sepsis i will be gald tbf :)
[2:06:08] thiccsushi: Wrath classic will carry the numbers until launch in 2023
[2:06:11] tydrennistv: Keep havoc a 4 buttons spec!
[2:06:14] mavericks312: ppl gotta get the thoughts that 10.0 is dropping before january
[2:06:16] rbgdev: Hunt is better
[2:06:16] SyRr82: @Towelliee whats gonna happen with all the old mounts, nobody's gonna use them indragonflight?
[2:06:16] MILESkg21: why cant Magni just yeet himself into the sun already KEKW
[2:06:17] bypized: @Towelliee wrath classic is confirmed coming this year, then theyll also have to fit in 9.2.5, which they wont clash? Will? then alpha, then beta, then the prepatch will hit, then the expansion, we only have 8 months left in the year. So we are really behind arent we?
[2:06:18] luckfore: wasnt quite a wotlk ++ lol
[2:06:18] pavepawns: i rly want a rough sketch for each classes talents
[2:06:22] rbgdev: I want to keep the hunt
[2:06:23] Shearkahn: Wrath Novemeberish?
[2:06:23] Rastailian: @91niki @haxzorjimduggan Magni keeping that First Aid skill alive
[2:06:24] FranciscoTheMage: I LIKE the fact they are ditching REP friendly honored revered ETC @Towelliee THANK GOD. time to ditch all that
[2:06:27] Rayzodoom: maybe... doesn't seem like they have done they need to test in the alpha
[2:06:27] Lunarr0: blizz needs to save my frost dk its just not a good class lol
[2:06:29] joe_g_433: Beta this summer?
[2:06:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrath will make them a ton of money for Christmas with the boosts
[2:06:31] BlueBeast33: Where were all the cool new changes for Wrath btw?
[2:06:32] 91Niki: @Rastailian OMEGALUL I SNORTED
[2:06:33] its_legendaric: do you think 10.0 will release this year or next year?
[2:06:37] MayroVision: Wait‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
[2:06:37] LeroyEngels: true
[2:06:43] psycho_scythe: When can we expect wrath classic you think? @towelliee
[2:06:44] bypized: Feels very vanilla in a good way
[2:06:46] MayroVision: I thought Towellie was a dwarf?
[2:06:47] feherlofia123: is there an indepth thing about the heal evoker spec
[2:06:51] LeroyEngels: @letssascha next
[2:06:53] KingSlayerYotam: Yea id love less systems overall
[2:06:53] nouwandhi: whats the addon that shows the str and crit on top left?
[2:07:07] Thoreya: i hope the talent system is in depth enough
[2:07:09] 91Niki: We're all gonna have to relearn First Aid for when they remove that sword KEKW
[2:07:09] Dirtnose: Definitely feels like a clean slate, similar to how Legion brought in a bunch of big changes
[2:07:11] QuigsTV: They should take the best covenant abilities and put them into a tree. So if a different covenant is for st and the other covenant is for aoe than add those 2 abilities
[2:07:11] MammothGB: got to squeeze another 10 years out of this system
[2:07:12] LeroyEngels: im so hyped for the talent tree's
[2:07:14] thiccsushi: @nouwandhi It's a weakaura
[2:07:16] dutchie76: wow no leggos
[2:07:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: The tier sets are always great
[2:07:17] h_u_r_k_: @MayroVision he switched like a year ago or 2
[2:07:19] SmallzzIV: do you like the level cap increase? or do you think it will lead down the same road?
[2:07:24] bypized: @Towelliee I like the feeling that is more vanilla, but my concern is the fact that is the same writer of the two previous expacs....
[2:07:25] MILESkg21: https://twitter.com/jdotb/status/1516756626031759360 LMAO KEKW
[2:07:28] Radtvlol: Im still a little concerned about the quality stuff
[2:07:32] Ghost5392: I'm worried it might be too bare-bones for me but I guess we'll see.
[2:07:33] BfAleTitan: @QuigsTV Convoke was on that druid tree
[2:07:34] pavepawns: i rly like the petition stuff
[2:07:35] Yagr6: im a modern wow player and all ive known is modern talents... the trees ill be exciting
[2:07:36] Ortinoth: seeking out crafters was great
[2:07:37] Sprowa: looks a lot like new world
[2:07:39] reggiepowa: it seems a bit lacking to me, gonna have to see how big those talent trees are
[2:07:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: @91Niki magni's voice going to be booming from all the banks where our hearts of azeroth are, "champion where are you????"
[2:07:43] Frank4LuLz: MOPO
[2:07:47] Frank4LuLz: MOP
[2:07:48] MayroVision: @h_u_r_k_ sooo no one plays ally anymore?
[2:07:56] 91Niki: @HaxzorJimDuggan LUL
[2:08:01] Orirholim: @SmallzzIV i think they did the level increase because it would have taken too much time to mess with shadowlands scaling
[2:08:01] lordmyer: KEKW Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[2:08:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: To craft a mything raid level item, it can't be too easy
[2:08:03] MammothGB: @JagrZero it's daunting but so much more fun to have the level of customisation of trees
[2:08:03] dracullus: in last 4 expansion they wanted to preserve clean state, now they think it's better to clean up house every 3-4 expacs and build up like in older times
[2:08:04] skaya86: Raid recpies plssss
[2:08:11] FallenxGabe: Alliance is a dead faction
[2:08:14] Mecabeast: Def for recipes
[2:08:15] Betrys: @Towelliee it kinda feels like they got the profession inspiration from ff14
[2:08:16] mmrghost7: the question is THE gear from proff , will they be compatible with mythic raid gear
[2:08:21] GngrWoW: @nouwandhi EssentialStats WA
[2:08:23] 91Niki: I still really really hope that they will put in a system that you keep the progression on professions, even if you swap profession @Towelliee
[2:08:27] MILESkg21: CAHMPION HEAL HER WOOOOONNNZ SwiftRage
[2:08:30] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee remember in vanilla having to find a tailor for mooncloth cooldowns..
[2:08:32] Thoreya: i hope the talent system is in depth enough
[2:08:37] CritcobainTV: I have 20 Plaguefall lol
[2:08:38] FranciscoTheMage: its like that on steroids maybe
[2:08:40] pereadin: I‚Äôm here bro
[2:08:41] MayroVision: How‚Äôs a faction dead lol? What happened to the ally?
[2:08:43] faulen: how was jailer LFR?
[2:08:46] pereadin: Game is loading up
[2:08:46] byrdeen45: let them get upset hell they will get upset over about anything right now
[2:08:47] Eziak: I think heroic is a decent place for recipes that are mythic item level crafted
[2:08:48] tydrennistv: More -
[2:08:50] Beriggeek: I need necro and gambit lol
[2:08:52] Ghost5392: @MayroVision Way less people than horde. Once cross faction raiding comes out that may change a bit if players aren't restricted from grouping together.
[2:08:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: i wonder if jewelcrafters will spec into a specific gem color
[2:08:58] xhaven: @fallenxgabe if alliance is a dead fdaction why are there still many alliance on all servers and some ally only servers as well?
[2:09:02] QuigsTV: And add the recipes to a vendor to spend coins from vault to obtain them besides the raid @towelliee
[2:09:02] TommyGachi: you know there's going to be people just botting and completing all the work orders in the new system
[2:09:02] hey_im_hy: they could just make recipe ranks like they are now and would just reduce mats the higher rank you had from higher content
[2:09:06] FallenxGabe: Every one moved to horde
[2:09:08] Pvt_Cornflower: Hard agree. Crafting felt meaningful when you had to engage with all of the content. It gave more meaningful purpose to trash in dungeons and raids.
[2:09:16] MagiiCarps: Do you think dragonflight is a perfect time to get back into the game, talking like fresh account
[2:09:17] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee can we please have 3 professions.. so i can gather myself
[2:09:19] Khade_Tyrson: I think we need to have is gathering be secondary and 2 main proffs.
[2:09:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Profession talents could be very interesting
[2:09:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: like i can cut the hell out of a red gem
[2:09:23] Lunarr0: do u think they will make frost dk good again lol
[2:09:23] tydrennistv: Gold shire in on moon guard going to be lit with scales!
[2:09:23] Nessebr: @Towelliee i wish they exapnded number of professions. they are celarly taking some crafting stuff from new world, wis hthey would let people have gathering and crafting professions
[2:09:31] Mitune: maybe trinkets vs gems vs socketing items @xhaven
[2:09:31] faulen: @Towelliee how was Jailer LFR?
[2:09:34] Nikit0sBarb0s: Last i've played alt was legion, I wish for accountwide progression
[2:09:38] 91Niki: That's a little too hardcore. Wildstar can tell us how that went
[2:09:42] MayroVision: @ghost5392 damn‚Ä¶ does each realm have a stat that shows Ally/Horde?
[2:09:48] mavericks312: i can see JC's choosing between rings,necks, or trinket crafting
[2:09:50] MILESkg21: DEDSTAR AngelThump
[2:09:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: They said at one point they fixed the item level of trinkets in ZM, but they still suck
[2:09:59] Jollywhompus: I just want profressions to make it wayyyy harder to max out. I don't want to max out a profession early but 99% of gear is worse than M0
[2:10:05] itmesabotage: have we heard anything about everything - rep msq quests - being account wide @towelliee ?
[2:10:08] Mecabeast: I'm wondering how vault rewards will be with the change in m+ dungeon pool

[2:10:28] nomfa96: Hi Towellie, big eu fan here.  Which tank do you like to play the most? :-)  Thanks for an entertaining stream
[2:10:28] FallenxGabe: @xhaven I play in eu servers there‚Äôs only 2 main alliance servers rest are horde
[2:10:31] ardilla808: i thought the work order was cool idea
[2:10:41] Mitune: Inscription is kinda bordering on pointless imo
[2:10:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Work orders makes it easier to be a fulltime crafter...I can be banging out hammers at 4 AM like I love
[2:10:47] tydrennistv: Im a little sad we didn‚Äôt get pre order
[2:10:56] Ghost5392: @MayroVision There are some websites that offer some form of pseudo tracking but nothing official. Easiest way to see how dead ally is is just looking at the HUGE gap in the hall of fame list between horde/ally.
[2:10:58] Nikit0sBarb0s: How about mergeing gathering\crafting together?

[2:11:20] szble: was the maintenance delayed?
[2:11:23] flebbooo: I'm glad they atleas trying to do something fresh with professions, cause that was one of those features i kinda expected they wouldn't care for much going forward
[2:11:24] Jollywhompus: @Towelliee what should the absolute top prof gear item be from an ilvl perspective? Raid finder, normal, heroic?
[2:11:31] MayroVision: @ghost5392 thanks dude. Dead servers = no fun

[2:11:43] nephttv_: prot pally was def goated

[2:11:51] luckfore: unforge
[2:12:02] Tokies: god tier, when you took that break I felt sorry for you. You'd been waiting for god tier pally for like 4 years
[2:12:03] MILESkg21: Mistweaver and Resto SHAMPOO
[2:12:13] LehBiscuit: LUL
[2:12:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Class buffs are still kind of dorked up I think....I would like to see them fix that
[2:12:18] elanoira: hahaha
[2:12:20] lilwaldo: Oh yea, talk dirty to me Kreygasm
[2:12:34] ZujuZapp: are you going to try the new ui customization options at all? or stick with what you know

[2:12:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: I can kind of understand having each class bring a buff, but it's just not right at this point
[2:12:58] Lunarr0: cant wait for dks to be god teir kek
[2:13:02] nephttv_: mostly just want to check the flying out if possible
[2:13:08] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee how can i get in on the alpha
[2:13:09] Mecabeast: I feel the balancing of the new talent system will be a mess initially.
[2:13:13] lilwaldo: @Towelliee  You think new race/class will be available before the expansion comes out like they did with DK's?
[2:13:22] werkoutaden: When crafting was like in WotLK and Cata where some mats were so sought after and players would grind for those pieces.  It was an entire circle of gettting the mats, finding the person to craft it and getting more pieces to help you get better gear that you knew others were trying to get made a good experience.
[2:13:24] lithium364: yeah only thing missing is all the dungeons specific
[2:13:32] FranciscoTheMage: I LIKE the fact they are ditching REP friendly honored revered ETC @Towelliee THANK GOD. time to ditch all that
[2:13:33] Amarlian: They announced that it will be @lilwaldo
[2:13:38] CritcobainTV: I hope i get in alpha
[2:13:39] Scoodles91: pray
[2:13:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: They said we will get the dragons in pre-patch to level
[2:13:41] Jewishraver: @lilwaldo yeah they said that on prepatch the new class and race will be playable
[2:13:42] tydrennistv: When do you think will get pre order?
[2:13:46] CritcobainTV: that'd be dope
[2:13:48] lilwaldo: Sick
[2:13:49] rbayduden: i will be the first one in alpha, just saying
[2:13:50] candwee13: @Towelliee are you allowed to stream alpha? i cant remember
[2:13:51] Koperniiik: Ian said they will release all talent trees before alpha so they can change anything ppl dont like
[2:13:53] FrankTizzle: beta optin is meaningless; done it every single time, never got it
[2:13:54] PanoramicPanda: did you see hazelnuttygames Ion interview? Ion mentioned 8 dungeons launch with 4 in Mythic S1 and 4 others in Mythc S2
[2:13:57] andrewmb01: there only doing this because they have no choice
[2:13:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it should be lit
[2:14:00] Poiuykk66: What about dungeon sets? Like beastmaster etc with a quest line to upgrade them like you once could @towelliee
[2:14:02] pereadin: i signed up for the beta as soon as the website went up lol
[2:14:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: i got in shadowlands beta in the first wave, hoping for a repeat
[2:14:05] FallenxGabe: Alpha early 2023 maybe?
[2:14:05] pavepawns: Beat up uldaman again
[2:14:07] Mitune: Looking forward to new Uldaman
[2:14:13] berkelium90: guys did towel quit lost ark???
[2:14:19] darssia_: only 2 weeks though which kind of sucks.
[2:14:22] DeanoTV: its 2 weeks before release right?
[2:14:26] ZujuZapp: where did they say we play evoker in prepatch?
[2:14:27] Squeak_Official: Does anyone believe that they would open up the Dracthyr to other class choices? I foresee an abundance of this new class/race combo and possibly not enough spaces for them all in the group content
[2:14:31] faulen: I love prepatch events
[2:14:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: uldaman m+ makes me shiver
[2:14:40] MegaMange: its not 100% but if you are a top like 100-150 ce raider you usually get the beta
[2:14:42] im_n0t_jezus: i wanna see the OG dungoes get a M+ intro
[2:14:47] c0mmander_starscream: I hope BLizz finally does something with giving us Account wide addons to manage alts
[2:14:48] feherlofia123: @squeak_official not right away
[2:14:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would prefer 4 weeks prepatch so people have plenty of time to level their dragons
[2:14:54] Tokies: i hope they let us play the old uldam though. i hate when they pull dungeons
[2:14:58] pavepawns: @HaxzorJimDuggan why?
[2:15:06] Bulldawgx: Sorry just got here. Have they said when you will be able to preorder it??
[2:15:11] Valhallelujah: I liked the part in the cinematic where all the dragons fly in. its foreshadowing to all of us flying away on all the dragons we slay for dragon mounts when the xpacks over. whole xpack is to farm drake mounts lol
[2:15:17] nephttv_: kinda excited to see if legion stuff comes back in the talent tree @Towelliee Should be fun
[2:15:37] feherlofia123: @squeak_official thing is evoker has  breath based and wing based abilities that no other race could play evoker
[2:15:42] DwarfWarrior25: DRAGONS
[2:15:47] CptTeempo: The Age of AYAYA
[2:15:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I am so relieved that it's really dragons.....it's freaking cool
[2:15:51] MOLAR305: @Towelliee with our ability to link our accounts to twitch now active, do you see beta keys as drops for this expansion?
[2:15:54] CptTeempo: cutedogA3 cutedogA4 GuitarTime Lai Lai
[2:15:55] Alepouditsa: what the name of that mount again
[2:15:55] ellasky: so when do we think 10.0 will come out?
[2:15:56] Mitune: Think the expansion will end with the age of mortals agian Kappa
[2:15:58] Orirholim: @Squeak_Official maybe in 11.0, i doubt they'll do that while dragonflight is the new expansion
[2:16:04] Bernardo994: i miss the old days of hybird builds
[2:16:21] Squeak_Official: @feherlofia123 I understand evoked being Dracthyr only, but I think Dracthyr should have more class choices IE Warrior / Mage / Priest
[2:16:29] joe_g_433: Over all I‚Äôm impressed with the announcement. They told more than I thought they would. I‚Äôm hyped
[2:16:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot-Holy could be disgusting lol
[2:16:33] Squeak_Official: Evoker*
[2:16:36] marshmallow110: i really hope beast mastery can get the legion dire beast back was alot of fun to play
[2:16:50] feherlofia123: @squeak_official right my bad. but i agree
[2:16:51] KingSlayerYotam: tanks might be broken with dps talents
[2:16:52] DuploThief: i would like some speed set back for mount and transmog farming @Towelliee
[2:17:00] pavepawns: depends on how broken it is
[2:17:01] Poiuykk66: Hunters shoulder be able to use their pets or certain pets as their mounts.
[2:17:05] Poiuykk66: Should
[2:17:06] pereadin: They tried doing that and fixed it
[2:17:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot itself was fucking up arena in Shadowlands....with more Holy it would be totally broken
[2:17:09] Bernardo994: that would be cool though
[2:17:12] pereadin: Remember 1 tank 4 dps in first mdI?
[2:17:15] Bernardo994: tank is healing all the way
[2:17:22] FallenxGabe: 10.0 late next year?
[2:17:23] MammothGB: If people want to do it, let them because it'll free up healers for other groups LUL
[2:17:24] pavepawns: i mean theres already pala tanks doing 20+ with no healers currently
[2:17:25] haveachub: shouldnt, because then you make healers obsolete in a possible meta
[2:17:27] Bernardo994: if ur pallly
[2:17:29] Orirholim: can't you wog spam right now in shadowlands tho?
[2:17:32] MOLAR305: @Towelliee with our ability to link our accounts to twitch now active, do you see beta keys as drops for this expansion?
[2:17:33] Orirholim: as prot i mean
[2:17:34] Squeak_Official: No worries, just thinking there might be too many Dracthyr evokers running around lol
[2:17:34] Bernardo994: Shaman tank ijnc
[2:17:35] Tokies: sham tank
[2:17:40] YENqtx: Wotlk Enhance shaman tank
[2:17:44] Chiphazzord: people been doing that since bfa with 0 healer
[2:17:45] tino49: that would be broken but so cool to see
[2:17:46] calvinandhobbes811: I feel like the idea of being able to be more hybrid is fun. But people will optimize the shit out of it and people will feel forced not to be hybrid
[2:17:49] rei__03: can't see that happenign for high end content
[2:17:52] maalow: depends on the class tree
[2:17:53] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[2:17:56] matx83: Does the tree allow that though? If you look at druid one it has two boxes one generic druid and one restro doesn't it?
[2:17:57] Oblunsky: that sounds like swtor
[2:17:58] IianaDRK: 123
[2:17:59] Mattsta: It would be weird to keep the idea of specs and then allow stuff to go too far beyond what their spec does
[2:17:59] pavepawns: since there is already pala tanks doing 20+ keys i dont think there is gonna be a massive issue regarding that
[2:18:05] nephttv_: @Towelliee If you need help after with keys lemme know
[2:18:08] dalaraz: they dont want to go in sale
[2:18:14] dalaraz: keys going to sale
[2:18:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Beta keys would really rock if they can do it
[2:18:30] Ghost5392: @Squeak_Official There will be a ton of them but it will be no different than DH or DK or Monk.
[2:18:31] FallenxGabe: It‚Äôs not hard other games had that
[2:18:34] Shaele: half of that team is already fired so no problem now KEKW
[2:18:37] MOLAR305: with the purchase of ABK lets hope they fix that
[2:18:40] raymond3195: maybe frost dk tank again with the talents
[2:18:41] Elijahss: they don't do keys anymore these days
[2:18:48] kets70: yup strong legal team its why blizzard has avoided all controversy all this time
[2:18:52] nephttv_: yeah im down, not doing much this morning
[2:18:52] Orirholim: chat, any news on when pre ordering would happen? i know there's maintenance on the bnet shop today
[2:18:56] MOLAR305: @Elijahss They did for SL
[2:18:57] calvinandhobbes811: @towelliee I feel like people will optimize the fun out of the new talent tree. And people will feel forced to limit how hybrid they go in the pursuit of max dps
[2:18:57] cappei: @ketsui07 YEP
[2:18:58] kets70: except that one thing
[2:19:07] pereadin: @Neph__98 we get you in after, just hit us up when we needed a lust sadge
[2:19:11] Orirholim: bummer
[2:19:16] duffluv22: Towelliee still has WoD keys....lol
[2:19:24] nephttv_: @pereadin im still waking up so probs for the best lmao
[2:19:27] ThiCCboiyG: ThiCCboiyG subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Brick SQUAD!
[2:19:30] Mattsta: SL pre-order was like halfway between announce and launch wasn't it?
[2:19:33] mavericks312: if there waiting on resets we still have the CN reset to morrow
[2:19:40] FallenxGabe: It‚Äôs wired that there‚Äôs no pre orders
[2:19:47] Bacanu34: mby after 24 wen the sale ends
[2:19:48] lawles_walrus: i wonder if they will wait till the end of the month for people to get paid?
[2:19:49] nephttv_: Hes had a rough morning mna
[2:19:52] 91Niki: blink if you need help
[2:19:53] Niietz: What tank class do you think would be the most fun/easier in m+ to play for someone that has never tanked (but played other classes)?
[2:19:54] luckfore: pre order with 9.2.5 release for allied race
[2:19:56] Ghost5392: @calvinandhobbes811 Well yea but that is because a lot of people have fun playing that way. If it wasn't the case then cookie-cutter builds wouldn't be so prevalent.
[2:19:58] CivvieBeard: earnings call monday
[2:19:59] Ms_shelley84: I don't think he is...maybe give him an energy drink?
[2:20:00] LeXieSterling: When do you think we will be able to buy the new expansion?
[2:20:05] Consensus_: Consensus_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:20:06] CivvieBeard: probably find release window then
[2:20:24] cabalish: time for a coffee
[2:20:27] szeeman62: @towelliee do you still have a discount code for origin?
[2:20:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Niietz For tanking the easiest to learn is bear, but Paladin is more fun
[2:20:33] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[2:20:45] werkoutaden: WotLK Classic release before Dragonflight..possible?
[2:21:08] KennyPowers5: @towelliee do you think the new default base UI will be good enough to get people to switch from addons/ElvUI back to default.
[2:21:15] ILikeKillTheZombies: have you seen a paladins dev makin an edit for drakthyr dragon form?
[2:21:16] FallenxGabe: Yes wrath is this year
[2:21:37] Ortinoth: i doubt people will switch to default updated ui from elvui
[2:21:43] Ortinoth: i know i won't be
[2:21:48] fbirobertmueller805: @towelliee you smoking that bomb?
[2:21:53] jure__: what they've shown of the new UI was veeeery early in development
[2:21:55] Ortinoth: elvui is to customizable
[2:22:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: they're one step closer to removing add-ons to support mobile
[2:22:07] Mistery836: I will try the new UI before I decide if I want to change it LUL
[2:22:15] nephttv_: rogues auto super fast so its easy @Towelliee
[2:22:19] FallenxGabe: It was a nightmare to set up my ui I hope it doesn‚Äôt brake it
[2:22:20] Aidler: But I‚Äòm sure it will require some work from the elvui people to adopt to 10.0
[2:22:25] mavericks312: addons arent going anywhere stop it
[2:22:56] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: getting nervous?
[2:23:19] Shamwise: Draggin deez?
[2:23:27] mavericks312: dead game though
[2:23:27] Thoreya: everyone is gonna be an evoker
[2:23:29] Thoreya: literally everyone
[2:23:36] astral_kingdom: What about GW2 expansion? :p
[2:23:37] darssia_: i hope they fix the proto drake camera it's so busted
[2:23:45] cappei: I'll be riding my Legion Glad mounts. Dragon on dragon action LUL
[2:23:47] Ilibrit: Already got my blazing drake, don't need anything else
[2:23:50] Stormrazer78: @towelliee You Hyped for 10.0
[2:24:00] ILikeKillTheZombies: @Thoreya the same has been said about vulperas :P
[2:24:01] MammothGB: my favourite is the ulduar protodrake so might stick with that
[2:24:05] Sylphy_TV: pepeMeltdown 1% drop
[2:24:20] Thoreya: its a breath of fresh air
[2:24:21] Sniper_Penguin: jokes on yall.. i can already turn into a dragon with dragonwrath
[2:24:28] werkoutaden: All tanks will walk though the cities as THE GODS they are in Dragonflight.
[2:24:54] Ortinoth: i still think the dractyr should have been able to tank
[2:25:14] ILikeKillTheZombies: drakthyr should have additional body type
[2:25:34] ILikeKillTheZombies: dev from another game even did his own version of it :D
[2:26:22] andrewmb01: I would love to raid log without boring content like torgast being required
[2:26:32] h_u_r_k_: they would have to re-do the armor for a bigger version right?
[2:26:43] FranciscoTheMage: i enjoyed torghast.
[2:26:44] ILikeKillTheZombies: they dont wear armor :P
[2:26:45] Yagr6: gear is the power
[2:26:46] FranciscoTheMage: why did people hate it
[2:26:47] andrewmb01: play more alts
[2:26:47] Ortinoth: a calmed down back to the roots of wow is what is making me come back
[2:27:00] mavericks312: fisrt grind is to get the duck mount
[2:27:00] lannimite: Destro üò£
[2:27:07] Ortinoth: i really hate the borrowed power
[2:27:10] MammothGB: I'm just looking forward to it being a lot more alt friendly, I can't bring myself to grind 1 character only
[2:27:10] reggiepowa: thats kinda me
[2:27:10] dutchie76: a lot of people
[2:27:11] Hebi2Cold: How does the lock have both green and red rain of fire?
[2:27:14] andrewmb01: @FranciscoTheMage I heard torgast got better but on release it was horrible
[2:27:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: They always complain LUL
[2:27:19] pavepawns: can never please everyone
[2:27:21] DeanoTV: Remember wod?
[2:27:31] dutchie76: maybe a more Alt friendly expansion
[2:27:31] ILikeKillTheZombies: i want shitton of cosmetics
[2:27:34] onous_: Idk drakthyr feels like a worgen reskin.
[2:27:35] mavericks312: but if they overload it with power they would complain on the otherside
[2:27:36] Bernardo994: im tired of power i loose over and over
[2:27:37] StarbuckTech: i am happy for talent trees again. I always like tweaking a talent build back in the old days
[2:27:39] ventu105: a dragon race lol
[2:27:39] Niprub: wait people WANTED a new system for blizz to mess up?
[2:27:43] pzp666: @Towelliee your UI is trash how can you even see anything..
[2:27:44] Jango_: its there, its the talent trees.  Which appear to be our talents that we have now comined with soulbinds in a tree
[2:27:50] soopaGreg: Same words and hopes every pre-exp ... lol
[2:27:51] joe_g_433: God. They will never win with everyone.
[2:27:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: I plan on having about 5 different loadouts, yeah
[2:27:56] MleveK: Exactly give me my power through Gear. Not 20 systems
[2:27:57] eldercandle: its gonna be nice to use your actual class talents as power again though
[2:28:06] ventu105: dragon race like in neverwinter mmo lol
[2:28:13] hostilehoboATL: they need to supplement with newerdungeo, quest and raid content then
[2:28:20] brucezhu: The amazing part of no overloaded system is it's much easier to play alts
[2:28:21] Ortinoth: no as long as they make it alt friendly
[2:28:22] fbirobertmueller805: I heard the same about BFA and Shadowlands lol
[2:28:22] coldhandsbeatz: Im totally ok with the power system being solely the new talents. Despite that, you would think that we the amount of work that they wont spend now on new systems we would get more content, outdoor content and such. Lets wait and ser
[2:28:24] Alepouditsa: or ppl will start asking what is your talent tree and then let you join a dungion danEvil
[2:28:27] Ortinoth: *now
[2:28:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some of the hardcore PvP might have a dozen different loadouts, they're going to love that
[2:28:35] Rastailian: has anyone ask if evoker artifact weapons are being added (class hall, too)
[2:28:38] assman_ny: There's T man.  Morning all

[2:29:12] ventu105: I don't like thorgast @towelliee I hate it
[2:29:13] Wickerman87: No new tower though
[2:29:15] akia03: so your screwed without alts
[2:29:16] yaashs: At this point alts just need to level up right? all the power is in the talents anyway now
[2:29:20] Tyredex: It just means they can focus more on raids and patches, which means less content drought.
[2:29:21] andrewmb01: well if you can only spec your blacksmithing into helmits and you want more blacksmithing I guess you go on an alt and do chests
[2:29:38] Anbean: @Towelliee im actually more interested in a story..i mean, what comes next after all this?
[2:29:39] Sylphy_TV: cohhNotes Accessability Got it!

[2:30:13] ZealotryTV: @lannimite not me
[2:30:14] andrewmb01: borrowed power threw forced content has been historically not received well by a big population of wow
[2:30:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not going to main the new dragon, but I'm going to play it and level it up
[2:30:21] akia03: @h_u_r_k_ me 1 play i char
[2:30:24] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee do you turn down ion interviews or dev intervies. why we never see them here? they gotta know you have questions
[2:30:25] MammothGB: Galakron and/or Chromatus must turn up at some point
[2:30:28] andrewmb01: especially the borrowed power that you cant change
[2:30:31] MammothGB: galakrond*
[2:30:37] h_u_r_k_: @akia03 sounds boring lol
[2:30:43] cabalish: @Sylphy_TV cohhNotes  add Account-Wide
[2:30:48] Jango_: Galakrond final boss, bet
[2:30:58] Wickerman87: U think there will be a read thread from shadowlands, like Yser being resurrected?

[2:31:15] andrewmb01: If they said your dragon riding had a special ability and you can only choose one dragon people would rage.
[2:31:33] HaloS23: @Towelliee "Azeroth is waking up" Is this our last Expan on Azeroth??
[2:31:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Evoker is similar to Ele Shaman, but with some neat mobility stuff
[2:31:49] Aidler: the cosmic powers can come in along the way. we had that with BFA too in the beginning
[2:31:50] DragonofWolves: Well shit my corsair mouse is going..
[2:31:58] h_u_r_k_: somethings coming
[2:32:03] Naturalbeef: Imagine Ragnaros coming back

[2:32:34] PvtHudson093: Who knows what will happen in the 9.3.5 story, maybe some Azeroth stuff in that]
[2:32:35] BigBusiness: What does the team 2 thing mean?
[2:32:35] GamingwithWilson: I think they are starting to head into the realm of the old gods
[2:32:36] Koperniiik: Shes healing with sword in her :)
[2:32:43] h_u_r_k_: sword got retcon'd its now 2 daggers you play with
[2:32:47] PvtHudson093: I meant 9.2.5
[2:32:50] Ellyasveil: what sword? Kappa
[2:33:18] cabalish: @BigBusiness wow 2 team is developing dragonflight
[2:33:22] Exodeo_: what is there to be mad about though?
[2:33:22] Nokterian: Sword? Kappa
[2:33:26] ILikeKillTheZombies: i dont think many people are mad at least from what i read, its 1 post on mmochampion
[2:33:27] Goatsguffle: I enjoy this game so I am excited
[2:33:27] Aidler: azeroth is already awake but she is a slacker
[2:33:30] Rudric_Ice: dracthyr needs a masculine form
[2:33:31] ILikeKillTheZombies: and i read forum plus mmochampion
[2:33:32] SensationalBanana: People are dumb.
[2:33:33] st3ts0n98: i called this xpac back in MoP. the second they introduced Wrathion i knew twe would have an Xpac about trying to get the dragons their titanic powers back
[2:33:36] szble: everything is hate these days Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[2:33:36] Xprodyge: the only thing im disappointed in is the dragon models
[2:33:43] joe_g_433: Those people will never be hppy
[2:33:45] Grizly922: same
[2:33:46] ILikeKillTheZombies: The only thing people are have heated discussion is new race and class
[2:33:59] DryR: it looks good and i actually want to play the new class, but i don't really like the race and that it's race locked
[2:33:59] Jango_: fan of borrowed power lmao
[2:33:59] pavepawns: im a fan of borrowed power but i dont like when it goes overboard
[2:34:08] faulen: that shit was fun af
[2:34:08] tb3763: I think most people assume Blizzard will fuck it up somehow someway
[2:34:10] Goatsguffle: that was BADAS
[2:34:11] Jango_: you guys are high, im out
[2:34:13] Vatali_Tia: i hated the daily grind
[2:34:15] AinaTan3: I didnt like when I lost the artifact weapon
[2:34:18] BlueBeast33: Problem is everything after artifact weapons weren't nearly as good
[2:34:21] jhm89: then once the expansion is over everybody remembers it fondly lol
[2:34:24] Sylphy_TV: Artifact Fishing pole POGGERS
[2:34:26] Vatali_Tia: i hated feeling like if i missed a single day in game i was behind
[2:34:27] Happykillmores: hey @Towelliee I hit lvl cap when shadowlands came out then stopped playing. As a returning player what is the best thing to start doing to get into raiding mythic dungeons?
[2:34:28] PanoramicPanda: borrowed power, fun. 3 xpacs in a row? not fun.
[2:34:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Artifact weapons were badass, but they took a lot of work to max out
[2:34:31] Kruggalugg: farm your ap or else!
[2:34:31] h_u_r_k_: @Jango_ iam
[2:34:33] andrewmb01: I wouldn't say all the systems where good
[2:34:39] SirBiggimus: Artifact weapons were the best iteration of borrowed power
[2:34:40] pavepawns: @Jango_ didnt know you hate tier sets :/
[2:34:40] MammothGB: @buxton1919 I think people are just used to not being heard, so far it seems like they've listened
[2:34:43] Yoitsnova: legion was perfect with legendary vendor from the jump
[2:34:51] andrewmb01: azorite traits where an epic fail
[2:34:52] ILikeKillTheZombies: I think people will base their opinion in the beta or alpha to see how it all plays out.
[2:34:53] MaleFrom73: I switch mains every two weeks, so borrowed power is as for me
[2:34:57] coldhandsbeatz: We hated giving them up, not having it. Thats the bad thing about it being borrowed
[2:35:17] Crunchroll0630: I am digging the BFA soundtrack
[2:35:36] andrewmb01: thats my thing why do they spend so much time on these systems that people may or may not even want....  spend the time on another raid or 2
[2:35:37] Tokies: true
[2:35:37] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[2:36:07] Tokies: would have saved them tons of money to. I think a lot of WOW players are cheaper dates then blizzard thinks they are.
[2:36:17] croppeast: is it just me or do we get kinda distorted sound?
[2:36:33] mk__9: i dont mind borrowed powers. i mind the time gating blizzard introduces to them. and also they are usualy not alt friendly.
[2:36:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: The sounds is good on my end
[2:36:58] dalaraz: distorted souns is lag almost all of the times
[2:37:00] andrewmb01: if you play wow to just pvp or just do professions I think your insane...  So less systems more raids/dungeons I think is a much better strategy
[2:37:00] ZetYokai: i just wonder why they felt the need to add all those external systems, so much waste dev time, do they not trust themselves to make a good interesting game without it?
[2:37:03] croppeast: Hmm could be the low latency setting, think i read smth about that. So gonna change that
[2:37:11] Chronine: @croppeast if you distort just reload anbd it fixes it
[2:37:18] Drumac_: It would also be nice to not have the Item lvl cap increase per new major patch/raid
[2:37:27] andrewmb01: @ZetYokai they want people logging in
[2:37:47] andrewmb01: @ZetYokai adding those systems made sure you logged in or you where not as strong as you needed to be
[2:38:05] tblizzzy: i just got to the point where i have to choose a covenant is it prefrece or are there spesific one that would be good for fury warrior
[2:39:01] Scoodles91: kyrian is for all dps specs
[2:39:06] Scoodles91: for warr
[2:39:09] werkoutaden: It would be nice if the dungeon system would players choose like a fast run or lengthy run, but then people mostly want to get the loot and get out.  But if there were like additonal mats or a dungeon tier set for finishing longer dungeons would be fun.
[2:39:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: @tblizzzy Icy Veins and WoWhead have guides about choosing a covenant
[2:39:31] croppeast: @Towelliee & Chat sins i just got back onto wow i got some Qs if u dont mind. Is there a known issue that causes mini stutter / freezes for the game?
[2:39:37] ZetYokai: @The_Andrewmb but in the end it just made people quit, myself included, i like to multi spec and it was just impossible to be optimal at all
[2:39:39] ILikeKillTheZombies: i bet dragonriding will be like skyscale collection in GW2
[2:39:41] pavepawns: dragonriding is available at the beginning but it takes time to increase air time and speed
[2:39:42] tblizzzy: thanks @croppeast
[2:40:09] andrewmb01: dragon riding time gating is not going to stop you from doing a heroic raid if you don't do torgast
[2:40:09] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:40:16] pavepawns: probably
[2:40:21] saiphyy: @towelliee hey just upgraded to a 3080 ti and wanted to ask your recommendation for a monitor?
[2:40:25] propwash80: @ILikeKillTheZombies i agree, when i saw it i thought of GW2
[2:40:28] akia03: do we have to use the build a dragon or can we use our own mounts
[2:40:29] dalaraz: i believe there will be something like talent points locked behind weekly quests
[2:40:35] andrewmb01: @ZetYokai hind sight is always 20/20
[2:40:48] Samurai3434: Raging no less
[2:40:50] pavepawns: i rly hate explosive week though
[2:40:53] pavepawns: its so boring
[2:41:25] andrewmb01: its easy to say these systems worked and these systems hurt the game and what do we do next expansion... But like Ian said they have to scramble to fix something that they spent a lot of time on and there shooting themselves in the foot
[2:41:34] werkoutaden: This should of been the exp to gen the Dragoon Lancer char like FF1V
[2:42:01] LeGoogs: Its a 20 you shouldnt have to
[2:42:14] croppeast: Hmm i rly have to check if theres some performance guide for WoW now, cuz getting 60fps on a 3080 seems very wrong
[2:42:35] saiphyy: @towelliee hey just upgraded to a 3080 ti and wanted to ask your recommendation for a monitor?
[2:42:44] tyranade_: Tyranade_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 51 months! 
[2:42:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: That one half-giant race in Dragonflight are the dragon-killers kind of like that dragoon, I think
[2:42:59] Sollice: Check graphic settings. Advanced tab and make sure fps limit isn‚Äôt on
[2:43:18] Sollice: You should be getting more than 60
[2:43:37] croppeast: @Sollice Chcked it, it dosent go bellow 60, but can get up to 80 in empty areas
[2:43:50] Nickbick17: Nickbick17 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[2:43:58] Ms_shelley84: bless you
[2:43:58] croppeast: just seems to stay around 60, might try some Nvidia control settings
[2:43:59] Nokterian: bless you
[2:44:02] CptTeempo: Bless you Towelliee cohhBless
[2:44:03] Bernardo994: god blesses you my son
[2:44:07] dalaraz: @croppeast sounds like wow using some onboard card
[2:44:13] TheRandomLootDrop: That oled alienware monitor looks amazing!
[2:44:15] arturiuss44: @croppeast So I bought a new PC at xmas and it has a 3080 TI and I have wow maxed and I get almost 200 fps so not sure what may be happening to yours.
[2:44:19] werkoutaden: @weirdo_dude yeah use dragoon chars that use polearms and swooped down and fought like guards
[2:44:30] ZetYokai: i pray and hope they make alts easier next expac, they always says they are making it easier, but never do
[2:44:31] assman_ny: MSI is pretty good, its been good to me.
[2:44:45] Sollice: That Alienware monitor is what I want also
[2:45:08] Tweetpog: So you mention wrath plus? That's gonna blow the lid off... what news!? @Towelliee
[2:45:09] Collected1: croppeast : make sure your monitor refresh rate is set above 60. and if you're using a monitor that doesn't go above 60, get a new one.
[2:45:10] Landru82: do you think the addon will be released this year?
[2:45:14] duffluv22: Hope they invite class specific experts...per say, first
[2:45:43] Shadraak: i'm thinking about getting a LG 27GP850-B as it's <400 thee was the 299 one at gamestop i thnk it was an MSI one but i'm told this lg would be better for my 3070ti
[2:45:58] croppeast: @arturiuss44 Yeah even with running it in 1440p, this seems low. @Collected1 Will do, should be locked to 144 but gonna recheck
[2:45:59] Collected1: Yeah what happened to this wrath news.
[2:46:23] werkoutaden: A lancer class that used polearms in Dragonflight..that would be sick
[2:46:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrath this year!
[2:46:27] Tweetpog: You said you had some insider info about wrath, that was HUGE, where is it
[2:46:29] luckfore: not quite wotlk ++ tho
[2:46:48] croppeast: @Collected1 Well found one thing in the resampling Quality tab, for some reason it was set on a AMD setting while i have a Nvidia card
[2:46:51] roeddogg: not having LFG is GREAT
[2:46:52] nephttv_: 1 spear should be enough here
[2:46:56] faulen: They should have jsut limited to a server
[2:46:56] croppeast: got 60 more fps just by that
[2:46:58] reggiepowa: i mean nobody uses lfg in retail, why would it be in classic
[2:47:01] ArcaneSyntax: yeah my interest in wrath classic dropped to nothing without dungeon finder
[2:47:07] Collected1: croppeast : ahh nice
[2:47:19] druidhex: I played in wrath the lfg came out way late in expac
[2:47:24] Rudric_Ice: only thing i didn't like about the expansion is the race its looks bad
[2:47:26] Chronine: @reggiepowa badges in wrath
[2:47:29] ILikeKillTheZombies: i was dissapointed about no LFG and how drakthyr look or being available only for 2 races, everything else i love about the expansion.
[2:47:30] Rudric_Ice: it*
[2:47:44] reggiepowa: @Chronine they can have them from quests or bosses
[2:47:49] Relic7: Anyone else not a fan of Survival? I'm a Hunter main and I Just can't click with it
[2:47:52] Relic7: Feels so RNG heavy with bombs
[2:47:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: link achievement for heroic dungeon invite
[2:48:49] croppeast: @Collected1 Probably some settings that is messing with eachother as i normaly tweak settings pretty hard. Guess ill just test and see if i can find the guilty party
[2:48:53] kiffar: I'm pretty hyped for the  profession revamp
[2:49:29] Sollice: Crop did you have an amd card and upgraded to a 3080
[2:49:38] werkoutaden: @Relic7 Surv hunter should be all traps and not using a polearm for melee
[2:50:01] KingSlayerYotam: Id much prefer world content over m+/ raid relater content
[2:50:02] Chronine: yes but the quest was a dungeon, which people would use lfg for. now you have to manually form a group which takes longer to complete.
[2:50:23] Samurai3434: What professions are you going to pick for your main?
[2:50:55] ArcaneSyntax: apparently the new race can do the base level of dragon riding everywhere without a mount
[2:50:55] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[2:51:19] croppeast: @Sollice havnt had a AMD card sins their 1080 black edition..so 10 years, and it was on another rig. So wierd it was set to that
[2:51:19] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[2:51:31] Cafe0le: @Relic7 survival hunter is perfectly fine the way it is now, so fun in arenas
[2:51:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: i imagine the work order system is gonna have to have some kind of limit to how many you can fill per day, to prevent bots from just taking all of them instantly
[2:52:28] ThePawPaw: i want to see JC and Alchemy ofc Inscription
[2:52:30] Collected1: the switch from "we believe players should see our zones from the ground" to "here's a flying mount to explore our new zones" is amusing
[2:52:32] ILikeKillTheZombies: I want blacksmith transmog
[2:52:41] Scoodles91: bombs are back, maybe? ?
[2:52:42] Drumac_: I can see the mounts being requested to be crafted a lot
[2:52:46] Rudric_Ice: so the new professions are like New world ?
[2:52:54] Alllprimer: LUL
[2:53:01] assman_ny: Lol same old man problem
[2:53:22] ExtreemeCheese: I LOVE the GW2 crafting. Hoping they take crafting towards that model
[2:53:32] kiffar: Any chance there are going to be other big things coming to the xpac they haven't announced yet?
[2:53:35] ILikeKillTheZombies: I made money in WOTLK jewelcrafting
[2:53:35] Collected1: i've heard "we're going to make crafting good again" before and it failed to deliver
[2:53:44] DannyG757: a new gold sink mount could be cool
[2:53:58] TastyyBeverage: De be Dragons
[2:54:09] S1appadabass: i want a toothless dragon
[2:54:14] DragonofWolves: Um completely off topic but question for chat, anyone used a Logitech G502 mouse?
[2:54:14] Bernardo994: i leather work and always max it out and make my own armour.  to fill out tickets to make gold would is very welcomed
[2:54:17] lannimite: Work order stuff sounds cool
[2:54:18] DragonofWolves: use*
[2:54:34] Tambandia: So no shaman tank, but i got hopium for 11.0
[2:54:37] Sledgecore: crafting quests in Legion
[2:54:45] Drumac_: i wonder if that will be with fishing also?
[2:54:47] Texas_Mizfit: i want to see reroll token useable to reroll the vault
[2:54:48] tekfury: it was good in legion
[2:55:02] Coldlight1: Legion was so good, my fury war felt so strong.
[2:55:03] Velashen: They said SL would be better. Eh they tried with the legendary components.
[2:55:23] Tokies: It sounds like you don't enjoy the AH interaction. What you like about crafting is the human to human part of it. So, what you are looking for is crafting like a cart guy who sells those spicy hotdogs with avocado and all kinda stuff on the street in cali. Not like the AH which is like a store shop online without really dealing with humans.
[2:55:38] dracullatv: Ion said that profession gear gonna be same power as mythic raiding gear
[2:55:41] kiffar: yeah like FFXIV. FFXIV does professions right. Glad to see WoW taking some inspiration from that
[2:55:55] ZealotryTV: @Velashen SL was good. the amount it took to skill up was the main issue
[2:56:05] Elindalyne: wow subreddit is raging about how dracthyr look
[2:56:08] ILikeKillTheZombies: They might get bored of that direction and try something else expansion after dragons
[2:56:19] Dirtnose: @Elindalyne wow subreddit is always raging LUL
[2:56:24] Rohen86: THANK YOU
[2:56:28] Velashen: Real progression with crafting this expansion. Housing 11.0 I think would be awesome.
[2:56:31] Anbean: @Towelliee didn't they do same thing with covenants? they told everybody that this is what we get and thats it. flopped time after
[2:56:35] Ryanmyman2234: How hard is it for a new player to get in to WoW right now?
[2:56:43] Elindalyne: its very easy
[2:56:51] hey_im_hy: wow reddit always cares more about cosmetics than the actual game
[2:56:52] thecyclone0: I love everything talked about so far
[2:56:53] S1appadabass: cant please everyone
[2:56:55] Ryanmyman2234: Or when dragon flight was to come out?
[2:56:56] bigoldmeatpie: they want to bitch. that's it
[2:56:57] Rohen86: The WoW subreddit is the wrost!
[2:56:57] Collected1: i wanted dark rangers
[2:57:00] c0mmander_starscream: Reddit wants WoW 2.0
[2:57:03] Bernardo994: it could be the greatest expansion ever but there will always be ppl who bitch
[2:57:06] Bernardo994: all the time
[2:57:07] ChimmyNeutron: ChimmyNeutron subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Dragons are fun
[2:57:12] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Xsilentghost (warning)
[2:57:16] TarnishedBeaver: As a person that doesn't play WoW I was super impressed by the whole deep dive thing why is complaining such a meta thing to do online LUL
[2:57:17] Zettabyte: Reddit being like hypocrites Kappa
[2:57:22] crazy1god: towHAMUP
[2:57:23] shupering: people with too much free time complaining about anything to just fill up some of their time
[2:57:25] TacDuc: Some are bad, but there are a lot of people that also like it
[2:57:26] cruzeal: looking at wow reddit is kinda monka
[2:57:29] Tokies: A part of me doesn't look forward to the new AH changes. I do about 8% of my medium servers AH biz. I have every profession 3x. Generally speaking when they do profession changes they don't talk to people who actually do the day to day profession stuff. It's target at raiders. Who don't really like it anyways. They don't farm up the mats put all the old pieces and do the work of it.
[2:57:34] thecyclone0: wow subreddit is full of people that dont even play wow and just like to complain about things
[2:57:38] kiffar: NGL when they said time for the next chapter of World of Warcraft, I half expected a fat 2 to appear and shock the hell outta everyone LUL
[2:57:38] Collected1: pink
[2:57:42] SkrrtPoE: Still sad it wasnt Tuskar race lol
[2:57:44] Dirtnose: green
[2:57:45] CritcobainTV: pink is paldin lol
[2:57:49] Kneckt: TEAL
[2:57:52] Kneckt: POG
[2:57:52] Otnerap: take out the daily grinded and even though i am a casule player or was.. by by LFR hate it not for me. however cant pug anymore so follow the masses
[2:57:55] CritcobainTV: its a darker monk
[2:57:58] Collected1: ooooh green
[2:57:59] faulen: Green again wtf
[2:58:02] Velashen: Pretty close to monk but okay.
[2:58:03] lannimite: People are complaining that the changes took too long. Like do you not want them at all now?
[2:58:05] Colly_UK: hmmmmmmm
[2:58:06] Tokies: @SkrrtPoE truth it was a real miss that they weren't a race or something
[2:58:07] zulway_: kinda uggo
[2:58:07] Iamcody4life: i like it
[2:58:08] Dirtnose: Looks good I think
[2:58:08] cabalish: monker green
[2:58:09] Bernardo994: dark green
[2:58:09] mavericks312: so forest green
[2:58:10] OceanManCarter: I like that!
[2:58:12] SpyCrabbo: yeah i've been going down a rabbit hole of threads complaining about how the new race looks and what a journey it's been
[2:58:12] Bernardo994: cool
[2:58:13] st3ts0n98: not bad
[2:58:13] CritcobainTV: hunter is forest green
[2:58:14] Ragingfirebush: bruh im color blind and thats legit the exact same as monk for me
[2:58:15] swordart2022: Looks nice fits
[2:58:17] Dyasis: I would have done a shade of blue
[2:58:17] hey_im_hy: should have been in the red
[2:58:19] CritcobainTV: or is that monk? idk
[2:58:20] Toskens: Just make it black instead
[2:58:22] CritcobainTV: err evoker
[2:58:23] hey_im_hy: lighter red
[2:58:30] wowbigs: Red?
[2:58:33] ILikeKillTheZombies: @SpyCrabbo wow, people have different opinions on that, how strange?
[2:58:34] Toskens: Priest is white so why not use black as well
[2:58:35] OvenMonkeyGaming: pot pots Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[2:58:38] ThePawPaw: Turquoise color looklike?
[2:58:38] technopithecus: Hunter color = olive... maybe sage?
[2:58:39] Taelse_: Hidden spirit
[2:58:44] dianthusnemo: hidden spirit
[2:58:46] CritcobainTV: this hunter is killing us KEKW
[2:58:55] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee so let me get this straight dracthyr can glide like DH's?
[2:59:05] lannimite: Hidden spirit
[2:59:08] ILikeKillTheZombies: I find it weird when there are like 2 posts on reddit besides the new race threads and make it like "whole reddit" is complaining about new expansion. :P
[2:59:11] SkrrtPoE: I want a tinkerer class too, bombs mini turrets explosive satchels
[2:59:22] Taelse_: glide+flap
[2:59:23] swordart2022: @spycrabbo When you look into shit shit looks back into you
[2:59:27] S1appadabass: They probably will boost off the ground
[2:59:27] Collected1: gliding with momentum i guess
[2:59:29] pereadin: their devs verbatem said "dracthyr can fly in combat"
[2:59:31] ZealotryTV: i just want to know how much the base classes are going to change with talent revamp
[2:59:41] Rohen86: Gliding ++ just means you can watch Book of Bobba Fett while gliding
[2:59:45] SynnZero: Cant we please for the love of god replace the default bag!!!!
[2:59:53] MILESkg21: ^^
[2:59:58] CptTeempo: KEKW
[3:00:00] PawgersHC: if I was returning now.. what would be the first thing I need to do
[3:00:05] Dirtnose: @SynnZero chances are with the UI revamp it will happen, if you mean the UI of it
[3:00:16] Collected1: i hope the new UI is a toggle
[3:00:18] swordart2022: @grittz6690 story quests then what ever you want
[3:00:20] Collected1: i like my old style UI
[3:00:26] SynnZero: not the ui but replace it with a 32 slot bag
[3:00:34] SkrrtPoE: whats the 9-5?
[3:00:34] Tambandia: I think the charged abilities might be weird to balance, hopefully they add these new ability changes to some of the other classes too.
[3:00:40] faulen: How are you going to handle 9to5 when you hit max level?
[3:00:41] Naturalbeef: Kid soccer practice today
[3:00:41] Zavier420: Toweldrago
[3:00:52] Tokies: 800 sandworn relics still no account bound
[3:00:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: i think we should be able to change our "visage" from to any of the other races
[3:00:54] werkoutaden: Evokers and Havoc players flexing the air time in the dps charts
[3:01:00] Ortinoth: he can only play like 17 hours on the 9 to 5 challenge
[3:01:00] TDTPrem: TDTPrem subscribed with Prime. 
[3:01:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: form
[3:01:26] Phobion: @Towelliee do you think they will adjust Drac'thyr's look?
[3:01:35] Collected1: https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1516801837529137158
[3:01:47] xhaven: I like thier looks
[3:01:50] SynnZero: I think it could be polished
[3:01:51] Phobion: Sadge :(
[3:01:51] ILikeKillTheZombies: paladins art director dev made new version of drakthyr
[3:01:53] mavericks312: just bulk there upper half up alittle
[3:01:55] just_laxus: i like their human form but i dont really like their dragon form
[3:01:56] swordart2022: I like it
[3:01:58] ILikeKillTheZombies: People want an option
[3:02:01] Bernardo994: all i do now is look at things for the expansion im hooked again
[3:02:01] yaashs: but the TRANSMOG
[3:02:04] Zerfell: they could add in a body mass slider
[3:02:05] ILikeKillTheZombies: not replacement
[3:02:09] pavepawns: i think they should give multiple choices. so skinny, beefy, in between
[3:02:15] Kneckt: way too big
[3:02:16] Mcsuiy: is there a male and female version?
[3:02:18] ILikeKillTheZombies: theres better one, made by paladins art dev
[3:02:19] Velashen: It looks like a scaly chicken. I don‚Äôt care for it at all.
[3:02:20] faulen: beefy boy does not look like a caster
[3:02:22] Alepouditsa: if it looks more mashiler the will ask for melee
[3:02:22] Drumac_: Well it's not a close combat class its ranged so why buff
[3:02:23] SensationalBanana: I don't get why people want brodude all the time... But giving options for body bulk is a good middle ground.
[3:02:24] honkblarg: give us a slider
[3:02:25] dianthusnemo: that looks like a dranai with wings
[3:02:26] mavericks312: the dracthyr def didnt miss leg day thats for sure
[3:02:28] xCentorius: Too big, looks more like a dreadlord ripoff xd
[3:02:30] honkblarg: to make them skinny or beefer
[3:02:30] Ortinoth: evoker is kinda tealish green color
[3:02:30] Phobion: would be nice if you could adjust @Towelliee
[3:02:31] lannimite: It does look like some EQ shit
[3:02:31] Yoitsnova: they're a ranged caster why would they be bulky
[3:02:32] Tokies: Yeah but maybe they have different forms? Like what they wanted to do with the kul
[3:02:32] SensationalBanana: People just want to be edgy
[3:02:33] Dyasis: don't like that at all
[3:02:35] TacDuc: Or atleast a choice between the humanoid race, and if you want to be bulky or not
[3:02:35] SynnZero: That thing looks like a tank
[3:02:36] luckfore: now thats what id play
[3:02:36] roflpotamus: I think male definitely needs to be a bit bulkier
[3:02:36] Ortinoth: according to the blue post
[3:02:39] dagdandris: Towelliee weight shaming the chad dragon
[3:02:40] FleuryGG: pandas can be mages, they are thicc bois too
[3:02:40] CushyPop: just make the neck shorter
[3:02:44] Aidler: bigger head‚Ä¶ slightly
[3:02:46] just_laxus: looks like an npc version of an dracthyr
[3:02:50] Thoreya: Class color for evoker is a real
[3:02:55] Thoreya: Teal**
[3:02:55] Phobion: LUL
[3:02:57] faulen: tuskarr beefy boy plz
[3:02:58] Tambandia: It's more an issue with overall character customization. It feels limited compared to other games.
[3:02:59] SensationalBanana: Bigger head, shorter legs would be my changes.
[3:03:02] CrusaderNero: fat gnome KEKW
[3:03:02] TompsonX: This is an opportunity for body type for sure
[3:03:06] Aceman120: yeah bro fat orcs!
[3:03:10] Drumac_: it would be nice to make cheracters more slim or phat
[3:03:11] BoezIRL: yeah they are caster so it wouldn't make a lot of sense to be beefy and muscolar
[3:03:14] orionnhawk: Skinny Kul Tiran! .. they are already in game ;(
[3:03:18] SensationalBanana: A thicc boi dragon would be amazing
[3:03:23] ILikeKillTheZombies: @BoezIRL you have tauren priests
[3:03:56] just_laxus: more like a human physique then a blood elf
[3:03:57] ILikeKillTheZombies: can i get permission for one link, theres a better one art done for adjusting their look :D
[3:04:06] Mallaes: HUGE!
[3:04:06] Aidler: a obese dragon‚Ä¶ that should be interesting
[3:04:08] OnePlayerPete: Nah, just less Jar Jar Binks
[3:04:08] S1appadabass: @Towelliee I just wanna know how they will Transmog
[3:04:10] Phobion: in the end this would have been Neltharion's army LUL
[3:04:16] SynnZero: Can we get another azeroths wooons quest :)
[3:04:27] unowncreature: I want my fat goblin :(
[3:04:36] cruzeal: piss easy affixes
[3:04:46] BoezIRL: @BoezIRL I konw but they can be warriors too, draktir are made to be only evokers
[3:04:47] raldrik: 100k burst ez
[3:04:50] Jewishraver: this is an easy week to push keys
[3:05:24] mavericks312: yea he said we have 8 dungeons at launch
[3:05:37] Reznr: Ya they already said they were available just not M+
[3:05:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah ion said 8 at launch
[3:05:50] NotWookiee: as someone who cares about M+ more than any other content, i dont like the idea at all.
[3:05:59] ohnot___her: I disagree I think the 8 dungeons should be in the 1st season. We want new content not 4 dungeons and 4 old in the 1st season
[3:06:00] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[3:06:13] NotWookiee: i would prefer all the dungeons in the M+ rotatioon and rotate timewalking like how legion was last week
[3:06:17] Scoodles91: im ok with the idea to add old dungeons to the M+ seasons, but the part that only half of the current will be available is kinda dumb
[3:06:22] Ortinoth: 8 dungeons for new dungeons - then 4 old dugeons for m+ i think is how i understood that
[3:06:22] Rohen86: What old dungeon is at the top of your list for the M+ treatment?
[3:06:25] mavericks312: @OHNOTHER so you wanna be burnt out of the dungeons by 10.1
[3:06:39] Atem___: Morning @Towelliee Hammers up! towHAMUP
[3:06:46] the_bad_goat: 54 monts
[3:06:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: i hate repeating dungeons in the next raid tier, im all for their current plan
[3:07:14] Kneckt: i hate plaguefall
[3:07:18] EppatTV: necrotic wake is fine for me tbh
[3:07:26] mavericks312: plaguefall can diaf lol
[3:07:28] Jewishraver: i despise PF cause no matter how many times i do this run i cant get my fucking weapon feelsbadman
[3:07:31] the_bad_goat: the_bad_goat subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 54 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hope you're having a great day!
[3:07:36] S1appadabass: Plaguefall towOof
[3:07:36] j_hooligan: Can I raise my hand for both?
[3:07:40] ohnot___her: @mavericks312 I havent gotten burnt out from the dungeons in SL and Ive played since the start. M+ makes it different to me
[3:07:42] EppatTV: plaguefall Madge
[3:07:42] PvtHudson093: If it didnt drop my BIS trinket i wouldnt go there at all
[3:07:47] darssia_: plaguefall is fine, the first boss is just terrible for wheelchair classes.
[3:07:54] mavericks312: and sanguine depths as well
[3:08:07] Naturalbeef: I want a maximum amount of M+ dungeons. I'd be happy with all of the Dragonflight dungeons plus all of the other 130 dungeons in the game with a M+ mode
[3:08:36] TompsonX: I hate Plaguefall, I like Necrotic Wake
[3:08:47] Ortinoth: hopefully they will keep the crafting ability of tier gear in 10.0
[3:08:59] swervo61: There will be 8 and then probs a new mega dragon dungeon
[3:09:04] faulen: 8 is the perfect amount
[3:09:04] swordart2022: Same 8 is not enough
[3:09:12] ZetYokai: there is gonna be another excuse they will come up with
[3:09:13] Amarlian: we should get a couple of mega dungeons that will split @Towelliee
[3:09:18] Ortinoth: well with less systems we could see a faster alpha and beta testing period? @Towelliee  or what you think
[3:09:24] mavericks312: well if were getting 8 at launch i can see them adding atleast 4 more in future tiers
[3:09:25] swordart2022: no
[3:09:25] Collected1: multi dollar company
[3:09:33] MILESkg21: short like VH KEKW
[3:09:36] tradingcardempire: I think them limited themselves to 8 dungeons is a bad idea...make the rewards seasonal but why 8 why not 7 or 9
[3:09:40] Velashen: Might be a way they are cutting back to get back on track timeline wise.
[3:09:41] EppatTV: 40min m+ dungeons sucks a lot
[3:09:47] FostBros: man i wish they would through trials in like ff14 that would be super cool to see
[3:09:50] haveachub: i miss like 30 min dungeons
[3:09:54] Kultak: 30min max, imo
[3:10:03] j_hooligan: We need some dungeons that are sub 20 mins
[3:10:03] ryanwcar: They're also developing the expansion for an additional year... there should be more
[3:10:04] OceanManCarter: 30 min is the way
[3:10:11] Samurai3434: YOu can turn evil the big slime if I'm not mistaken

[3:10:18] EppatTV: just have 30 min dungeons with 3/4 bosses
[3:10:19] swordart2022: if you whine about how long does dungeon I take why you do it KEKW
[3:10:23] Collected1: i like my dungeons to last like i last in bed, 5 minutes if i pull carefully
[3:10:25] EppatTV: 5 bosses are too much
[3:10:28] ohnot___her: What do you mean miss? we get that in other side haveachub
[3:10:36] swervo61: I honestly think they stick to 8 dungeons because of the change to how you get KSM
[3:10:41] Thadune: @Towelliee I'm curious to see how it works with gear. If the dungeon you want isnt on the M+ rotation.. so you gotta wait a week or two until it is?
[3:10:44] roflpotamus: Would make m+ more fun and bearable to me
[3:11:12] breadwilton: Yes! shorter dungeons would be great!!

[3:13:09] swordart2022: @xcenntric3k tweet at Devs for it.
[3:13:16] Faebaeuwu: @Xcenntric3k They said that you could choose form and it's not bound to combat. So you can stay in whichever you prefer
[3:13:35] carpentz0r: Where are you gonna make up all the percent
[3:13:47] Aidler: no maintenance in EU

[3:15:38] Goatsguffle: Yeah I had a group blaming me the tank for not getting explosives, interupting every cast and they pulled more to me that I couldn't handle and blamed me haha
[3:15:47] Sollice: If I go to the shop and find out you can‚Äôt pre order I‚Äôll ban you
[3:15:51] emznev: @DeanoTV NotLikeThis
[3:15:58] Velashen: Ban that guy lol
[3:15:58] Sollice: So‚Ä¶..
[3:16:13] emznev: a ban for that kekw
[3:16:23] tydrennistv: I‚Äôm excited as a Hunter I don‚Äôt need to feel pressured to have farm a covenant or some stupid borrowed power system for another spec on

[3:17:11] emznev: free XD
[3:17:12] Collected1: Towelliee : how about my tin foil theory, they're saving stuff for the May stream to get eyes on the mobile game
[3:17:19] TacDuc: @abracka_ The five aspects?
[3:17:21] duffluv22: Think they are just being cautious with everything and not rush it, like in the past.
[3:17:24] Sollice: @emznev just a pet peeve of fine. You should see it on downtimes
[3:17:25] bawheid: any say on release date? even which year it drops would be a start
[3:17:35] ElDrakenMan: i want to be subject to impulse buy. Who knows what I will do in a few weeks if I have time to think about it
[3:17:42] ManneehFresh: will they drop another raid before the expansion

[3:34:04] AlexBeardo: I hate ickor :(
[3:34:07] theDirtyon3: @Raioktv hes perfect for it imo. NOt wraithion wouldnt be but hes been in hiding A LONG time already hes much older and wiser

[3:35:38] shuey23: @flyingboots theres 226 gear for anima in the new zone. finishing the campaign and some treasures/ rares will get you 240 easily then you're almost good to go
[3:35:41] Exxcar: I'm genuielly excited right now @Towelliee

[3:35:52] Flyingboots: @shuey23 Gotcha thanks
[3:35:52] Velashen: It‚Äôs fine lol. Looks between monk and hunter teal.
[3:35:57] kaijoe_: The negativity is just so exhausting
[3:35:59] Elindalyne: more people are invested in hating on the game than playing... its how the internet works
[3:36:05] duman_2020: @FrankTheTank1988 I do, but for some reason it says that I don't.. this is why I asked the question.

[3:36:32] FrankTheTank1988: @duman_2020 thats odd NotLikeThis
[3:36:59] st3ts0n98: i would have thought they would have gone for a silver/grey-ish color for evoker to match the "prismatic" of the spells, but the blue-green looks good too
[3:37:03] JFeezy__: I like towelliee's ui. Gonna try and copy pasta some ideas out of it.
[3:37:21] WayneG947: the healing sounds like my kinda gig, burst healing in those 'oh shit' moments
[3:38:02] Collected1: i used to love fire fighting healing

[3:39:58] st3ts0n98: ngl though i was hoping for shadow hunter as a class since vol'jin is being rebirthed as a loa. having a range/melee hybrid that does shadow damage and calls upon loas to do damage sounds fun

[3:42:30] DallTV_: yeha could be
[3:42:35] nephttv_: this hunter is so sad lol
[3:42:41] dimofodi: No pre-order because they're trying to avoid what happened with SL when they had to delay launch and offered refunds etc.
[3:42:53] CrunkyBrewster: that was my thought as well.
[3:42:54] Dimeric: Does that mean, that we will get a new raid before next expansion ?
[3:42:58] PvtHudson093: Pre-order at Gamescon
[3:43:05] Exxcar: @Dimeric No
[3:43:11] duffluv22: Ill be playing COD this winter
[3:43:31] Dimeric: So we will get a new content draught now then ?
[3:43:35] Amarlian: I think an alpha that just had the talent trees and a New UI in would probably be a benefit to them @Towelliee
[3:44:02] Exxcar: @Dimeric No, they've already announced Season 4
[3:44:04] Skylin3r: sup towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:44:19] Convectus: lol true

[3:44:27] Praetour: Because it was delayed they removed the limits
[3:44:29] Eraste: kinda wish i had refunded KEKW
[3:44:31] StezyRIP: u guys know they dropped WOTLK this year to negate the no content
[3:44:32] Exxcar: @Towelliee yes you can at least in EU
[3:44:36] swordart2022: You can for 14 days in EU
[3:44:38] Bernardo994: yea either pre-order or dont
[3:44:41] dimofodi: It would straight cancel your whole pre-order and then you could order again later if you wanted.
[3:44:51] StezyRIP: theyre doing great things, it is gonna be 2023 for dragonflight
[3:44:59] StezyRIP: q3
[3:45:01] swordart2022: You can't spend time 8f you have with it.
[3:45:02] iMaccaPro: its probably legal reasons, i'm pretty sure there is a law in germany that doesnt allow pre orders of games that dont have a firm release date
[3:45:04] theDirtyon3: yea
[3:45:05] dimofodi: You would have yea.,
[3:45:05] raye_gaming22: you can refund cuz i did that with BC classic

[3:46:55] HaloS23: @HaxzorJimDuggan That sounds right!
[3:46:59] syrikk: people just have to complain about something TBH. Blizz could literally do everything they ask for and they'll just find something else to whine about
[3:47:16] LspN: @Towelliee what covenant for prot paladin?

[3:48:33] Bernardo994: they all do
[3:48:33] Dinosew: @Towelliee are you sad the new race won't have tank?
[3:48:39] jason_shade: wow is a copy of other mmo's which copied other games, which copied other games which copied board games which used language which others have used on and on and on
[3:48:39] y0rtek: the entire history of everything is ppl copying shit and improving on it
[3:48:41] TheKitsuneAdventures: look at marvel and dc they copy  each other lol
[3:48:43] Shearkahn: @Towelliee  I mean i can show you a Maewing on Ark that flies the exact same way

[3:48:44] RoboMaximillion: 14 literally copied overwatch lol
[3:48:48] Ander1345: I'd be more worried if games didn't borrow ideas, yeah
[3:48:50] CptTeempo: WoW copied Dark Sun Shattered Lands by making bug races

[3:49:08] shuey23: bro i swear nobody hates wow more than the wow comunity...
[3:49:08] Ander1345: I am so hyped for the pvp changes I need them now
[3:49:09] 3dRes: If its worse, or the same, then be ashamed
[3:49:12] Velashen: GW2 Mount system is the absolute best. They should use it!
[3:49:14] Xetherot: the nature of mmorpgs is that all of them copy each other.
[3:49:15] Bernardo994: its all an attempts to make the game better

[3:50:09] Kpxt: @Towelliee don't know if you've know but Hazelnuttygaming did an interview with Ion and it cleared up a lot of stuff from housing to Legos to their plans with borrowed power after dragonflight
[3:50:11] shuey23: BASED
[3:50:18] Velashen: It is going to feel soooo bad riding the other mounts after dragon riding. I don't think the community realizes yet how awful it will feel.
[3:50:18] theDirtyon3: i will never give reddit users credit

[3:51:59] Velashen: Hopefully they have already been working on housing for years. Maybe 11.0
[3:52:05] cruzeal: wasn't that garrisons tho
[3:52:06] aumixp: @towelliee The most important question havent been asked yet.. New mount achievements when?
[3:52:18] stallowned: if its close to wildstar housing ill Kreygasm that was so fun
[3:52:29] Maydie6066: @Towelliee i never understood the  demand for housing. I personally liked the Garrison's from WoD, but i feel like if everyone had housing, major cities would just be obsolete
[3:52:32] OlStubbs: Has towelliee seen the hazel interview?
[3:52:35] GrailNite: 11.0 house flippers of Azeroth
[3:52:41] NiXProdigy: i also think for housing i don't know if that can be like the only big feature of an expansion, still has to have other stuff which makes it harder to do
[3:52:48] Velashen: Garrisons were not even close to what housing can be. People should not even make that comparison.
[3:52:50] Ander1345: I don't think they will ever do housing
[3:52:52] CritcobainTV: mom, hot pockets!
[3:52:54] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[3:52:55] st3ts0n98: GW2 guild halls are amazing.

[3:53:18] Kpxt: @olstubbs he has. I asked the same question lol
[3:53:19] assman_ny: EQ had decent guild halls
[3:53:27] Just_Jaybles: what about housing like in SWTOR
[3:53:31] theDirtyon3: LUL
[3:53:34] Just_Jaybles: entirely optional
[3:53:37] RuggedRender: archeage had the best housing imo
[3:53:51] Velashen: ESO came later yeah.
[3:53:51] Dirtnose: SWG had best housing, not even close
[3:54:01] Bernardo994: lol could you imagine having limited housing like FF14
[3:54:01] itjustfeelsright: SWG housing > all
[3:54:02] luckfore: preach said this morning that he talked with some devs and they said the engine doesnt support it

[3:54:14] theDirtyon3: ESO has to dedicate servers themselves just for housing
[3:54:24] Bernardo994: wiow would blow up with toxic stuff
[3:54:25] School_Toilets: swtor housing came later
[3:54:29] faulen: wow mobile game. HOUSING (farmville style)
[3:54:40] tomcruise210: farmville was the shit  Û†ÄÄ
[3:54:40] Eraste: id play that
[3:54:51] krayaal: WOD had some kind of housing i guess
[3:54:56] theDirtyon3: what if the WoW mobile game is JUST housing KEKW
[3:54:56] Velashen: I'm down haha
[3:55:01] st3ts0n98: they would have to add craft patterns for housing decorations to alot of old dungeons and raids IE: northrend having vrykul themed decor
[3:55:10] Bernardo994: @krayaal yea it did
[3:55:16] Ander1345: I think wow mobile will just be a very robust adventure table type game
[3:55:23] lannimite: These first pulls are spicy

[4:10:50] LonelyGoose_: I can't wait to be the derpiest dragon possible
[4:10:53] Velashen: Yeah I doubt it is going to make shaman tanks and whatnot. Not totally transformative.
[4:10:53] EpicBananners: it looks like they took the conduit stuff and put it into a tree

[4:11:29] unholyorc: i hope i dont have to deal with a dps not putting a point into interrupt to get one more point into convoke or something
[4:11:31] Eraste: i think it could be a cool way to start adding new abilities back in without bloating rotations (assuming you'd only be able to pick X number of talents, anyway)
[4:11:40] Darkalex175: is hybrid going to be a thing? it wasn't clear
[4:11:43] BlockishTiger: Did you see the interview Hazel did with Ian? Good info in there that wasn‚Äôt in announcement.

[5:10:11] MILESkg21: MAKE WRATH SOCAIL AGAIN FeelsGoodMan

[5:13:05] Aidler: wow yesterday topped at 514k on twitch during the announcement
[5:13:13] dreamwalker213: So does wrath like last forever until it dies or what
[5:13:25] Damuffin14: id def be in for classic cata or mop
[5:13:37] gelimarr: classic legion
[5:13:41] faulen: WotLK directly into Shadowlands!
[5:13:47] MILESkg21: MOP would be fun but Cata can eat my balls KEKW
[5:13:53] KragnosWoW: i only care for up to cata classic since i started in mop
[5:14:04] Aidler: didn‚Äôt follow the yt numbers but together should be around 700k
[5:14:08] gelimarr: Cata is the only expac I skipped
[5:14:22] chinfu303: ngl i would love to play mop again but thats just nostalgia talking
[5:14:24] MILESkg21: LEGION
[5:14:33] gelimarr: MoP or Legion
[5:14:38] KingKreeft: Draenor Kappa
[5:14:38] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee In one of the interviews it says that main characters for Dragonflight are Khadgar, Tyrande and Wrathion, told ya the Dadgar will be back LOL
[5:14:39] Ganohh: i am not prepared
[5:14:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like the community votes, in game if possible....if most people don't want dungeon finder then don't add...but if most people do, put it in
[5:14:43] Xsidious: MoP
[5:14:52] emznev: BFA better than legion :)
[5:14:58] vaironixx: whats your favorite again?
[5:14:59] TazzTheGrimreapper: the only thing i liked about MoP was the scenerie
[5:15:07] conv3rge_: Throne of Thunder was soo good
[5:15:09] gelimarr: I loved raiding in MoP
[5:15:19] KragnosWoW: I feel like people say "fuck cata" but if they dropped a deathwing cinematic on us in 4 years and said cata classic is coming those same people would be hyped\
[5:15:21] Nokterian: Legion i did all classes @Towelliee
[5:15:23] Damuffin14: mop had better pvp
[5:15:28] FroggySense: Legion is when i really got back into WoW
[5:15:37] ghostprototype_ii: Legion was my prime WoW experience
[5:15:42] TobeyT85: mop pvp was great

[5:16:17] morp1onz: Evoker class color reveal, darker green than the monk green
[5:16:20] Xsidious: Towelliee you think they will add mounts you earn in classic to retail?
[5:16:21] swordart2022: @duhworks hell yeah afk for gear YEP
[5:16:39] dreamwalker213: @xsidious no chance
[5:16:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: The WoD-style stuff makes sense....it makes PvP more about skill than gear

[5:18:27] rilsolo: @sunnydains yea
[5:18:41] gelimarr: they redo the core system of WoW
[5:18:48] Bernardo994: ouch
[5:18:51] Novaht: Funny thing is, is that the dragon named rathian came from the game monster Hunter world lol
[5:18:52] Bernardo994: 10 years
[5:18:53] Arocian: lot of good updates coming
[5:18:54] nintendyoh: @Towelliee I'm sure you've answered this, but thoughts on dungeon finder not being it WoTLK classic?
[5:18:59] rilsolo: pvp gear will be at like 300 ilvl but in pve it will be 250 and can upgrade it to w/e mythic is or something
[5:19:20] nintendyoh: @Towelliee I fkin hope so. I loved it, don't use it for LFR just dungeons.
[5:19:33] swordart2022: COPIUM
[5:19:36] N3llee: Yea I'm shocked about that as well. I thought no Dungeon Finder would be a good thing for classic community.
[5:19:36] Clawanorder: Wont miss it
[5:19:37] gelimarr: I like LFG
[5:19:39] TheUnknowing: one of the reasons I was looking forward to wrath was dungeon finder xD
[5:19:43] MILESkg21: so many people complained that LFG ruined the social aspect but now they cant play without it KEKW
[5:19:48] N3llee: Helps keep that community feel
[5:19:55] N3llee: that Classic has
[5:19:59] ILikeKillTheZombies: i want wrath but with some additional content, not BIG changes like that
[5:20:05] sprert: "pull the LFG-ripcord!!"
[5:20:10] raldrik: LFR gets me twitchy after last night. 8 stacks on jailer
[5:20:16] rilsolo: the community feel atm is get boosted through dungeons to lvl KEKW
[5:20:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Spamming trade chat to try to find groups was horrible, J. Allen Brack was right about that
[5:20:26] swordart2022: Classic games classic rules.
[5:20:32] Voramir: I remember OT for my guild in icc and unfortunately never got sindragosa down, it would feel good to finally get passed that
[5:20:32] ArcaneSyntax: the community feel of looking for a wailing caverns group for 2 hours
[5:20:35] 3DMikeGG: ahh yes the classic feel of sitting in a city for an hour looking for a tank. by the time you fill someone has to leave
[5:20:42] N3llee: @rilsolo that has nothing to do with dungeon lfr.
[5:20:42] nintendyoh: Almost all of my friends no longer play so LFG is important for my fun.
[5:20:47] XshadowturkeyX: well tbh dungeon finder didnt come out until icc patch so most of wrath didnt have it Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[5:20:55] rymerre: no one wants the 'community feel'. everyone wants LFG even in classic
[5:20:57] Amarlian: The #1 thing that killed comminity in Wow for me was... Getting older and having less time to play @Towelliee . And more people need to realize this about themselves too.
[5:20:59] 770Cash: lfg is the best tool for leveling
[5:21:07] N3llee: @XshadowturkeyX that was my understanding as well
[5:21:21] ArcaneSyntax: they should have put lfg in bc classic and season of mastery
[5:21:31] gelimarr: Unholy DK = top dps??
[5:21:46] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Yeah thats all cool, but Khadgar is back in Dragonflight
[5:21:51] mugziloc: Merry 420
[5:21:57] rilsolo: @rilsolo has alot to do with it, no one does heroics on tbc anymore and majority of the normal dungeons are just SP and SLab boosts
[5:21:57] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || DRAGONFLIGHT CINEMATIC IS HERE BABY! My reaction to the NEW EXPANSION youtu.be/SGg9jNPuuuI
[5:22:03] albaconator: i remember cata heroics at launch and people complaining they were way too hard lol
[5:22:07] gelimarr: sad seeing hunters so low on dps
[5:22:10] N3llee: I dont get the up roar from the community honestly
[5:22:10] swordart2022: I dont think majority i am pretty sure most content in wow is done via premade group at max level .
[5:22:11] mugwurt: @Towelliee the voice of reason
[5:22:14] nintendyoh: @ArcaneSyntax I agree, it would of lasted so much longer and people who complain about communities is such a small amount. If they love wow they are in a guild they enjoy with a good community.
[5:22:27] N3llee: Since I played Classic and still play TBC now its not something I understand
[5:22:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, Wrath was built for casuals and to make things easier, love it or hate it
[5:23:11] swordart2022: Well i expected it there
[5:23:15] swordart2022: Was surpsied as well
[5:23:16] XshadowturkeyX: i think they should have dungeon finder up to lvl 68 and dont add it to wrath content until they add icc . help stop all the boosters and give people option to lvl in dueons after a few months in
[5:23:20] nintendyoh: Should be on launch.
[5:23:39] Faeldric: LFG is opt-in, if you don't like it, don't use it
[5:23:47] Amarlian: Split the servers, some with LFG some without?
[5:23:50] vadder_fister: true bro im so trash and anti social without lfg i will never see the inside of the dungeons
[5:23:54] chinfu303: i used to think league was toxic then i played wow classic
[5:24:17] nintendyoh: @chinfu303 lol, true.
[5:24:23] mugwurt: @Towelliee EXACTLY
[5:24:31] thepaladinjournal: exactly
[5:24:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: If a guy has 2 hours a day to play, and his guild buddies aren't on...should he spend an hour in trade chat trying to find a group?
[5:24:47] KragnosWoW: people still leave groups in premades so i dont get the logic behind removing group finder because people leave groups
[5:24:47] thepaladinjournal: LFG made life so much easier as a casual player
[5:25:11] vaironixx: @chinfu303 rocket league? :P
[5:25:11] diivil92: thats why i stopped in TBC classic i spammed hour upon hours for a tank and got nothing.
[5:25:31] chinfu303: @vaironixx league of legends
[5:25:45] vaironixx: I know, was a joke cause RL is toxic asf too
[5:26:14] chinfu303: @vaironixx lol true my friends play rl so i hear all about it
[5:26:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: The dungeon finder offering better rewards for tanking also helped to get more people playing tanks
[5:26:26] nintendyoh: It was such a pain getting heroic groups together in TBC...
[5:26:50] Faeldric: mythic was the answer to everyone hating LFG
[5:26:51] TazzTheGrimreapper: and that stupid hunter using Barrage, that hasnt been a good talent since cata
[5:26:55] swordart2022: Simple if people want qol = Shadowlands,Dragonflight.
[5:27:06] KragnosWoW: Yeah wow classic toxicity is worse than league of legends i agree
[5:27:06] thepaladinjournal: instead of removing LFG they should be adding it to the game on day 1
[5:27:07] SkyIexs: !yt
[5:27:08] Moobot: @SkylexsTTV Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || DRAGONFLIGHT CINEMATIC IS HERE BABY! My reaction to the NEW EXPANSION youtu.be/SGg9jNPuuuI
[5:27:10] D3m0nHunt3r666: always listening the wrong peeps regarding LFG :p
[5:27:18] postman_quest: I was on classic last night waiting around for three hours to find a group for a heroic
[5:27:38] swordart2022: @Quest_over same sub try Shadowlnads :P
[5:27:55] Layercake: People are using lgf addons on classic....why remove the feature ?  it's a change for the sake of change
[5:28:04] swordart2022: I think blizzard thinks like taht and taht is why they split it/removed LFD
[5:28:21] mugwurt: I might be wrong, but my money is on Blizz devs listening to certain streamers with large guilds on high pop servers, who have no idea what frustration finding groups is for normal players
[5:28:25] vexxalex121: is that FLR?
[5:28:28] vexxalex121: lfr*
[5:28:40] MILESkg21: true
[5:28:54] N3llee: @Layercake the lfg addons dont auto que to find people across multiple servers
[5:28:55] nintendyoh: What's true? Sorry
[5:28:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: It does depend a lot on the server
[5:29:03] 3DMikeGG: totally brought that up to my guild last night
[5:29:08] Noshpan: @mugwurt I love that you said that
[5:29:20] tekfury: yea streamer arn't real people
[5:29:40] swordart2022: @mugwurt that is some tinfoil nonsense LUL
[5:29:42] MILESkg21: SEPAI Notice Us AYAYA Clap
[5:29:42] 770Cash: tthey dont play the same game at all
[5:29:43] postman_quest: @fairplay2021 Stopped playing Shadowlands about two months ago because I done everything and was sick to death of doing mythic dungeons
[5:29:43] 3DMikeGG: "hey chat, i need to run heroic XXX" instantly a full group
[5:30:01] swordart2022: @Quest_over enjoy doing same in classic once a day with spaming lfg for hours.
[5:30:09] wrhashwizard: you have just under 2k.....
[5:30:10] wrhashwizard: lol
[5:30:13] nintendyoh: Finding a group, or just a group that can finish a heroic in TBC without wiping 10 times was a struggle.
[5:30:17] Molehj: preach!
[5:30:24] Amarlian: @merau_ You missed added the "I claim xxx drop too"
[5:30:25] MILESkg21: wtf u mean not real people
[5:30:37] Damuffin14: are they removing the teleport to the instance as well?
[5:30:42] mugwurt: @fairplay2021 no it isn't, the streamers have been very open in both their disdain for LFD and their conversations with Blizz devs and the influence they have
[5:30:50] Layercake: HahaThink ''Just make a group bro''
[5:30:53] thepaladinjournal: hey man, i was hpal during TBC, finding groups for heroics was rough, i was at the bottom of the totem pole
[5:30:58] swordart2022: @mugwurt sure dude
[5:31:25] mugwurt: @fairplay2021 I mean, i suppose they could be lying...
[5:31:48] MILESkg21: heals just afk cuz lfr KEKW
[5:31:55] swordart2022: @mugwurt well they are paid for lying so
[5:32:00] 3DMikeGG: why would a streamer lie? theyre my friends arent they
[5:32:06] nintendyoh: @fairplay2021 You're totally right, mugwurt, Blizzard listened to the 1% on LFD and shocked the other 99% when they said no LFD in classic WoTLK.
[5:32:10] mugwurt: Ion even mentioned the "community council" in the announce video
[5:32:15] swordart2022: @merau_ to get views EZ
[5:32:17] KragnosWoW: learning how to heal bro thats why theyre in LFR lmao
[5:32:32] GamerKillance: So far im not hopeful of DragonFlight. I don't like what theyre telling us so far. Hopefully they listen in Beta this time
[5:32:43] Amarlian: I have used LFR to learn a new class/spec to heal @KragnosWoW
[5:33:21] Blackmamba_S: @gamerkillance what do you mean?
[5:33:40] GamerKillance: Starters i hate the one new race only has 1 class
[5:34:03] GamerKillance: And i dislike the day 1 flying restrictions
[5:34:03] Blackmamba_S: why?
[5:34:04] MILESkg21: broken much
[5:34:12] nintendyoh: @BlackMamba_S Probably in reference to time gating things or something like the  conduit energy that was literally there to take time to change conduits.
[5:34:25] miboj95: @GamerKillance What restrictions?
[5:34:27] KragnosWoW: ive stuck to dps for that sole reason. ive always wanted to learn holy paladin but learning something new in wow is rough
[5:34:36] GamerKillance: Restrictions is something we hate.Shadowlands showed that with covs
[5:34:46] nintendyoh: @GamerKillance Can't fly in the new zones, like every expansion. Until later anyhow.
[5:34:50] unholyorc: 9.0 release ashen was broken now its REALLY good on some fights
[5:34:59] GamerKillance: And day 1 flying you can be knocked out of the air and looks gated fromtheir examples
[5:35:32] GamerKillance: We'll know that in beta. I won't cry wolf until then
[5:35:49] nintendyoh: That's what @GamerKillance is talking about. There will be CLEAR things that need to be tuned/changed and the community points it out while being ignored by Blizzard.

[5:36:06] cRUSSIANthegame: ive literally never seen anyone use that talent
[5:36:08] kilgarntv: i am dissapointed there will only be 4 of the new dungeons in the S1 rotation
[5:36:27] nintendyoh: @cRUSSIANthegame Let him play his way lol, he's just having fun.
[5:36:27] ONNIT: ONNIT subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[5:36:53] KragnosWoW: He is just making sure he doesnt miss the boss
[5:36:54] FranciscoTheMage: OMG if i hear that phrase one more time
[5:36:54] TazzTheGrimreapper: barrage is the absalute worst talent ever, it makes me cringe when i see a stupid hunter using that
[5:37:12] FranciscoTheMage: "just living my best life"
[5:37:12] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[5:37:15] cRUSSIANthegame: its not that serious Tazz
[5:37:41] KragnosWoW: @FranciscoTheMage why does it bother u so much KEKW
[5:38:15] FranciscoTheMage: overused
[5:38:19] abracka_: ‚Äúlook at me, i am the captain‚Äù
[5:38:22] TazzTheGrimreapper: @cRUSSIANthegame you loose damn near 2-3k dps if not more by using that talent...and it has not been useful since cata and still wasnt good then
[5:38:27] Pink_Cassie: They are not sadly lol
[5:38:52] nintendyoh: @cRUSSIANthegame Absolute* lose*
[5:38:52] KragnosWoW: Vulpera blood dk is the ultimate fit for someone with napolean complex
[5:39:10] cRUSSIANthegame: I main MM Hunter lol so ty for mansplaining it to me
[5:39:20] cRUSSIANthegame: Just saying, its not that deep. Just never seen anyone actually spec Barrage
[5:39:33] KragnosWoW: KEKW perfect then Kappa
[5:39:48] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee not sure if i missed your take on the cinematic.. out of all the expansion cinematics would you say this one was the worst best or middle.. i think the BFA cinematic was the best
[5:39:50] Faeldric: barrage is a fun button to push
[5:39:53] TazzTheGrimreapper: @cRUSSIANthegame i main a BM
[5:39:55] gurkalicious: Hunters in legion with barrage, pulling half the instances
[5:40:05] KragnosWoW: yeah i loved using barrage in torghast
[5:40:12] KragnosWoW: misdirect and barrage
[5:40:12] GamerKillance: Mop and BFA best by far
[5:40:17] KragnosWoW: EZ Clap
[5:40:30] Valyxx: it was C Tier
[5:40:30] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:40:33] Kneckt: top 2  for me
[5:41:00] y0rtek: I disagree, I don't thin it was bad. It reminded me a lot of the vanilla cinematic, something new, a sense of wonder. Every other cinematic has always been the big bad of the expansion.
[5:41:14] FranciscoTheMage: i mean of course the cinematic looked great. i just mean.. that BFA cinematic was just man AWESOme
[5:41:20] Archiee: don't forget to loot trash too, they have a chance to drop rep as well
[5:41:24] GamerKillance: mop didnt have a big bad
[5:41:26] D3m0nHunt3r666: anything good comes from exalted?
[5:41:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I think there is some kind of rep drop in the raid, too
[5:41:58] daegoh: It felt very uninspired.
[5:42:03] Short_Film: this one didnt set up story well
[5:42:04] PoppaMetal: the climb was seconds man lol
[5:42:10] Short_Film: looked amazing tho
[5:42:19] Velashen: It was kind of a misdirection from people expecting dragons at first.
[5:42:20] vaironixx: Stony tony was the best part of that cinematic towellie, stop hating :P
[5:42:20] sprert: there was no conflict or villain in taht cinematic... taht's was missing
[5:42:23] FranciscoTheMage: true that
[5:42:31] smashwow: the one time they take the time to tell the story Kappa
[5:42:40] GamerKillance: Void?
[5:42:41] KragnosWoW: If there is a book ill def read it
[5:42:44] KragnosWoW: dragons are dope af
[5:42:53] smashwow: the dude just over slept LUL
[5:42:56] devilhawk83: @Towelliee how likely do you think we will be facing a Old God in Dragonflight?
[5:42:57] Ryathael: IMO, BECAUSE DF doesnt seem to have a big bad, I feel like its gonna be setup for the next expansion after it storywise.
[5:43:03] FranciscoTheMage: lol his alarm broke
[5:43:08] Broomba: @towelliee did you read or listen to the wow novel ??
[5:43:08] peinen: good ol stevie danuser
[5:43:14] ILikeKillTheZombies: How did Alex got there
[5:43:14] zgag: Pretty much the Blizzard staple. Wait to introduce the cool stuff later and to only have/see it for a short time
[5:43:14] miboj95: I think it was something like the primal energy of the island has recharged and that's waht made them wake up
[5:43:15] pavepawns: @Towelliee its the primordials that woke the titans
[5:43:19] Velladyn: They said the world is healing, my guess is that the sword in Silithis is going to be removed by the aspects
[5:43:21] pavepawns: the watchers*
[5:43:24] rymerre: they kinda said it in the cinematic: they were waiting for the world to heal...we healed her woooons
[5:43:28] JeffsStolenBike: JeffsStolenBike subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[5:43:31] KragnosWoW: who is steve danuser and why does every one make a meme of him
[5:43:32] GamerKillance: Cause remember the guldan raid @Towelliee with a soothsayer showing the void attacking azeroth
[5:43:34] Molehj: Someone tickled his stones
[5:43:37] KragnosWoW: did he do something bad back in the day?
[5:43:40] BattleKnoedel: BattleKnoedel subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[5:43:44] YardRage: heal the woooonz
[5:43:50] pavepawns: The thing that wakes up the watchers are the Primordials
[5:43:53] pavepawns: aka 1st raid
[5:44:00] rymerre: cuz we are all 'stuck' in the shadowlands...but the dragons arent
[5:44:06] TacDuc: Could be, as the water did look like Azerite when they woke up
[5:44:07] givmeafrekinname: I assumed they woke up duing the fight with the Jailer in Azeroth's core.
[5:44:15] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee i think at the end of the next expac we will be stuck on the dragon isles bc itll be closed at the end of the raid OR AZEROTH is the final boss pof the expac
[5:44:21] PokerFaceMoose: the video literally said "Now" so im pretty sure it's happening now?
[5:44:24] FranciscoTheMage: oh that make sense.. while we were in SL it happened
[5:44:32] PoppaMetal: Stone oversleeping is believable. my 18yo still needs his mommy to wake him for school
[5:44:35] Kneckt: @Towelliee i just noticed bolvar has similar eyes to the stone boys
[5:44:41] MILESkg21: it started 10k years and then it was NOW
[5:44:51] rymerre: but those plants were blooming at the same time
[5:45:03] KragnosWoW: the sword woke him up
[5:45:06] TazzTheGrimreapper: should have woke up when Azaroth got impaled with the sword
[5:45:18] Molehj: "AHH! After ten thousand years, I'M FREE"
[5:45:21] givmeafrekinname: the world was probably going crazy during the fight with the jailer and that's what woke them up
[5:45:22] FranciscoTheMage: IKR @TazzTheGrimreapper
[5:45:31] pavepawns: Towelliee it says why the watchers woke up on the Dragonflight page
[5:45:41] pavepawns: its the primordial elemental protodrakes
[5:45:45] Watershots: LuckFore is gone now :(
[5:45:55] Naturalbeef: Ragnaros is back again
[5:46:01] FranciscoTheMage: so primordials eat other dragons?
[5:46:04] MILESkg21: Raggy 3.0 monkaS
[5:46:28] CorneliusDaDestroyer: She said everything we needed to know in the beginning
[5:46:49] MILESkg21: 4k HPS KEKW
[5:46:59] stallowned: so much dmg going out
[5:46:59] vaironixx: @Towelliee it says you will feel our return so im assuming the dragons returning woke up the stone boys so they could find dragon isles again
[5:47:09] Truthseeker96: LUL
[5:47:18] DiiscoViking: hey disc is a nerfed class, so sry
[5:47:23] pavepawns: @FranciscoTheMage primordials are the 1st elementals that started evolving into dragons.  so basically dragons made of elements
[5:47:27] Aggravius: im sure they tried their best
[5:47:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: If you can't blame the tank, then the healers get it.....the DPS were probably standing in junk tho lol
[5:47:43] Bashmort: yooo
[5:47:44] Kneckt: @Towelliee Bolvar has smiliar eyes to the stoneboys
[5:47:47] DiiscoViking: 243 ilvl, not the greatest
[5:47:51] Aurestrasz92: @vaironixx More like life and arcane energies were returning to the Isles, so that woke up the Watchers and in turn brought the dragons back
[5:47:54] Oasishydra: I just learned that ion played in my guild at some point lmao
[5:47:58] rymerre: they woke up cuz the world was healing
[5:48:03] rymerre: they went to sleep during the sundering
[5:48:06] Silver_Lion: Shroud ? Pog
[5:48:10] frogmoore11: Where are the isles on the map?
[5:48:13] uk_wildcats22: any guess for release date for dragonflight
[5:48:16] Kneckt: yes
[5:48:17] Naturalbeef: You would think Thrall would be center stage for the elemental being active
[5:48:20] xaezoria: when approximately do you think dragonflight comes out?
[5:48:20] vaironixx: The dragons returned to the isles, but couldnt see them until it was opened for them
[5:48:28] Kneckt: whatever the blue shit was
[5:48:29] Kneckt: for sure
[5:48:35] ijuki: He got stoned Kappa
[5:48:36] vaironixx: The dragons returning woke the stone guy i feel like and woke them up
[5:48:40] vexxalex121: obv is alarm went off
[5:48:40] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee The alarm clock LOL
[5:48:42] Naturalbeef: It's the Elementals
[5:48:44] Hitokiri83: the sword or the jailers attack on her
[5:48:46] CorneliusDaDestroyer: The aspects returning made them wake up
[5:48:46] pavepawns: The primordials
[5:48:46] Bashmort: probaly sense soemthing bad
[5:48:48] vaironixx: Thats why alex was there so quick
[5:48:48] Rastailian: isn't this the third time land was hidden in mists? pandering, timeless isle, dragon isle?
[5:48:48] xraynibba: wasnt it a volcano
[5:48:52] Kneckt: true the elementals maybe
[5:48:55] Aurestrasz92: Life and elemental energy returning to the Isles as a whole, kickstarting the Titan machinery most likely @Towelliee
[5:48:56] toobaked1987: Azeroth is better, so the watchers woke up
[5:49:01] vaironixx: to catch stoneboy, cause they were already there
[5:49:06] vaironixx: waiting for the beacon to be lit
[5:49:06] Samurai3434: It was the Wooonz
[5:49:10] givmeafrekinname: @vaironixx not even the dragons could find the isles so that theory can't work
[5:49:19] ijuki: @Samurai3434 monkaS
[5:49:22] Sielu11628: The azerite in the water has to be a large hint
[5:49:23] Velarn435: It sure wasn't the giant sword impaling the planet.
[5:49:25] ochiero_amarru: he woke up bc enough elemental energy returned to the land and he was the only one to wake from that
[5:49:30] pavepawns: just go to the frontpage
[5:49:35] toobaked1987: Maybe the sword was removed, waking up the watchers
[5:49:37] miboj95: They said in the reveal that the dragons left because the isles ran out of elemental energy, now after 10.000 years the energy is recharged which made them wake up
[5:49:37] vaironixx: IMO they knew where the isles were, just couldnt see them until the beacon was lit
[5:49:38] Skullbash0r: it was the pain about the bad shadowlands story that woke the watcher up
[5:49:47] rilsolo: yea it was the elemental energy think they said that some where yesterday in the deep dive
[5:49:50] TacDuc: They couldn't find the place before the beacon was active. And the stone boys woke up when something that actually looked like azerite at the bottom of the ocean began glowing
[5:50:07] givmeafrekinname: @vaironixx they literally say in the cinematic that the isles are hidden even from dragons.
[5:50:07] N3llee: who is removing the sword?
[5:50:14] CorneliusDaDestroyer: Think about it, how did Alextraza and the dragons got there so quick, they were looking for it, thus activating the watcher
[5:50:15] rymerre: so who removed a sword that large?
[5:50:20] Aurestrasz92: Either way, whatcha think of the Dracthyr evokers? :P
[5:50:26] Truthseeker96: @king_rhino88 this makes alot of sense
[5:50:39] ijuki: @Aurestrasz92 I am going rawr Kappa
[5:50:41] Naturalbeef: Steve said the dragons sense the Isles and the Beacon
[5:50:46] sprert: we probably will know what the rumbling was with patch 10.2.5
[5:50:49] givmeafrekinname: they got there quick cause of magic LUL
[5:50:52] vaironixx: jsut cause its hidden in mist doesnt mean they dont know where it is, they just cant see it cause of that
[5:50:58] FranciscoTheMage: someone said in some post that map of Azeroth as we know it is only like HALF the PLANET @Towelliee
[5:51:03] Kneckt: at the start i think they say when they need it to be found the watcher will awaken
[5:51:05] GamingwithWilson: Alextraza even said, that the watchers would know to activate the beacon because they would feel the dragons looking for it
[5:51:07] vaironixx: it was hidden from everyone, which they planned
[5:51:34] givmeafrekinname: @vaironixx hidden from everyone, including themselves. as stated in the cinematic
[5:51:48] vaironixx: @GamingwithWilson exaclly, they knew where it was, but they couldnt see it, cause hidden
[5:51:54] vaironixx: thats why they arrived so fast
[5:52:07] vaironixx: it doesnt mean they dont know where it is, just cause its hidden
[5:52:13] Aurestrasz92: @CorneliusDaDestroyer If you watch the cinematic again, when the Watcher wakes up you can see the storm hiding the Isles disappearing slowly. That most likely alerted the dragons that it was waking back up and it was time to head home, and they flew back with all due haste. Alexstrasza being an Aspect, and stronger than most dragons, would probably be exceptionally faster than the rest lol
[5:52:13] cart101512: Hi
[5:52:13] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || DRAGONFLIGHT CINEMATIC IS HERE BABY! My reaction to the NEW EXPANSION youtu.be/SGg9jNPuuuI
[5:52:15] vaironixx: it just means no one can see it
[5:52:23] D3m0nHunt3r666: Healers these days damn
[5:52:24] CorneliusDaDestroyer: @vaironixx Agreed
[5:52:25] FranciscoTheMage: YSERA hanging out in SL's or coming back? now her death.. and that fight. that wasnt even a expansion cinematic and that was EPIC
[5:52:53] Valyxx: I got MOP vibes from the cinematic
[5:52:57] vaironixx: yeah there has to be a reason they all showed up so fast after the beacon was lit
[5:53:02] vaironixx: they werent teleported there
[5:53:14] PrillaGorilla: Alex was finally able to use her hearthstone. That‚Äôs how she got there so fast.
[5:53:14] vaironixx: They actived the watchers by returning to the area
[5:53:27] xaezoria: when approximately do you think dragonflight comes out?
[5:53:37] FranciscoTheMage: a while
[5:53:54] FranciscoTheMage: early next year?
[5:54:01] Aurestrasz92: I mean... most dragons can fly across the Great Sea in a day or so, and with the Isles reportedly being in the center (since it was the center of the continent before the Sundering), it would take days to reach there by flight
[5:54:14] xaezoria: ugh so long, i just want shadowlands to be over with tbh
[5:54:18] Oasishydra: great question for a pre patch
[5:54:25] vaironixx: hidden doesnt mean they dont know where it is, but as far as them looking for it, and wanting to return to it, im not sure about that
[5:54:29] rymerre: maybe they werent looking at all...they just saw it open up and went home
[5:54:30] Aurestrasz92: it wouldn't*
[5:54:31] Silver_Lion: tow the new red shirt guy Kappa

[5:54:38] TheUnknowing: im assuming azeroth healing is why they went looking, idk though
[5:54:42] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Enough is enough, is our time to shine moment Kappa
[5:54:45] CorneliusDaDestroyer: Yeah true, that we dont know yet, why did they go back now after all this time
[5:54:46] GamingwithWilson: They are the protectors of Azeroth, at this time Azeroth is no longer is peril. Sooo their quest is complete for now, so they are returning to their motherland
[5:54:46] lbsam4793: Wrathion was looking they said
[5:54:46] Miklagard: What I wonder is how they gonna pull that big sword out fifiThink
[5:54:51] vaironixx: no they were looking, or else they couldnt have showed up so fast @rymere1983 thats what we just said
[5:54:51] Theduskflyer: The jailer dying
[5:54:55] Naturalbeef: The Elementals becoming active
[5:55:13] Vch001: Nordomu forgot to set the the timer on the stove and Ysera's cookies are burning.
[5:55:15] FranciscoTheMage: is this normal or LFR?
[5:55:18] cRUSSIANthegame: BARRAGE
[5:55:19] vaironixx: its speculated the next expansion will be a return to elemental stuff
[5:55:25] GrailNite: I think Azeroth cried out to them
[5:55:26] Sielu11628: That chinese gamer who predicted last 3 expansions did say that 10.0 would be dragons and 11.0 would be elementals
[5:55:38] vaironixx: @Sielu11628 yeah thats what i was talking aboutr
[5:55:46] Jarwerewolf: green dragon of  lost  wake  up
[5:56:03] Valyxx: The cinematic would have been amazing if Galakrond showed up .

[5:56:24] vaironixx: we dont know the big bad right now, doesnt mean there wont be one
[5:56:29] Sielu11628: The whole point was to NOT show a big bad
[5:56:35] Sielu11628: MoP vibes
[5:57:01] ashwing_: but they just said in the trailer that they will be the protectors again LUL
[5:57:04] vaironixx: yeah that makes sense
[5:57:10] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee No, it says in the cinematic that they need to protect it now
[5:57:16] Velladyn: I think they are returning to get their powers back
[5:57:19] Miklagard: I still wonder how they got there so fast to save stone bro, did the beacon teleport them there? fifiThink
[5:57:21] MeisterPetze: i would also heal if i have a huge sword in my fuckin back
[5:57:22] rymerre: 'finally healing' was taking place during bfa
[5:57:26] vaironixx: they hid it cause of sunder aka azeroth getting messed up
[5:57:27] MILESkg21: AFK KEKW
[5:57:27] Krasis: Wasn't there a part about how them returning would attract others too
[5:57:28] Nazz_1138: I think those elemental dragons are waking, woken up by the sword, then that triggers the wake up
[5:57:28] smashwow: finally healing, don't mind the big ass sword
[5:57:32] Aurestrasz92: @vaironixx galk? as in galakrond? cuz he's dead dead, and has been for THOUSANDS of years lol. Unless we get some overly zealous necromancer that wants him rezzed for whatever reason
[5:57:35] vaironixx: so now that its getting healed, they are back
[5:57:36] ijuki: They were aimlessly flying around Kappa
[5:57:38] xraynibba: they are returning because of the awakening of azeroth
[5:57:38] duhworks: looking for the islands
[5:57:41] AjjtheDK: maybe regain Aspect-like power from the source of dragonic power itself?
[5:57:42] CorneliusDaDestroyer: Ysera was there :P
[5:57:42] daegoh: remember the essences
[5:57:43] FranciscoTheMage: ok so since we talking dragons... in CATA we beat the crazy ass Black dragon. They all sat there and gave up their powers .. thats what i dont understand. how they got their powers back. and where the heck is Chromie
[5:57:49] vaironixx: @Aurestrasz92 never heard of time magic or necromancy dude?
[5:57:50] st3ts0n98: They are returning to regain their titanic powers they lost in cataclysm. since the dragon isles is where they were given their powers, Wrathion and the aspects believe that is where they need to go to get them back
[5:57:52] PokerFaceMoose: most dragonflights haven't done anything for awhile?
[5:57:54] smashwow: yeah they gave us Heart of Azeroth upgrades @Towelliee
[5:57:56] ijuki: But ... we get ducks Kappa
[5:58:03] vaironixx: go back in time and bring galk back? raise galk as a undead dragon?
[5:58:05] daegoh: The dragons literally gave us the essences
[5:58:07] Pink_Cassie: @FranciscoTheMage See I was thinking the same damned thing!
[5:58:07] Miklagard: Didn't dragons loose all their power/immortality at some point?
[5:58:11] KyleEverett: @Towelliee The Dragon Isles are awakening for other reasons. That's the water changing color at the start. They have to go back to take care of unfinished business. Such as the primalists that are the first raid
[5:58:11] toobaked1987: Have 10,000 years past since we have been in the Shadowlands?
[5:58:14] ijuki: Ysera died PepeHands
[5:58:15] rymerre: they were mostly in the background
[5:58:24] ILikeKillTheZombies: damn the ff xiv community and gw2 have a field they with "wow copied us"
[5:58:30] FranciscoTheMage: YSERA :-(
[5:58:30] ILikeKillTheZombies: field day*
[5:58:33] Aurestrasz92: @vaironixx I legit just mentioned necromancy.... And the only beings with any control over time magic are the bronze flight, and I highly doubt they'll want him back lol
[5:58:34] rymerre: as 'aspects' they lost almost all of their titan powers
[5:58:44] Aurestrasz92: Unless you bring in the Infinite flight
[5:58:45] CorneliusDaDestroyer: Ysera died yes but she still helped a little in the Shadowlands
[5:58:54] vaironixx: @Aurestrasz92 no bronze is not, nighthold had a boss that could use time magic
[5:59:13] vaironixx: just cause bronze has time magic, doesnt make them the only ones with it
[5:59:17] KyleEverett: No, their powers were curtailed.
[5:59:24] rymerre: they were killable before cata
[5:59:27] KyleEverett: Nozdormu lost a bunch of his time power he said
[5:59:29] pavepawns: most of their powers and immortality
[5:59:36] Aurestrasz92: Very, very sparse uses of time magic. She could only rewind her time. She can't go back thousands upon thousands of years to bring Galakrond back
[5:59:37] rymerre: their titan power are straight up gone
[5:59:39] ijuki: I have never died in WoW ... I am immortal... as I died on the first mob in vanilla PepeHands
[5:59:43] Sielu11628: Brozne/Infinite Dragonflight wil have a role from interviews, too (which makes sense). Interested to see Norzdormu turn into Morozond
[5:59:44] vaironixx: and doesnt mean other people cant use a bronze dragon for their own good
[5:59:57] TacDuc: I think they mostly just lost their immortality as they said "this is now the time of mortals" as they now are mortals
[5:59:57] vaironixx: or corrupt a bronze dragon to use time magic
[5:59:58] Krasis: They had a nap, now they good
[6:00:10] Valyxx: Think we get a new Lordaeron??
[6:00:12] dutchie76: got my 4 set finally!
[6:00:13] Frank4LuLz: 12 YEARS IN DRAGON YEARS IS LIKE 12 WEEKS
[6:00:20] rymerre: i dont think recoving from the dragon soul is like recovering from a cold
[6:00:23] FranciscoTheMage: what are the new offshoot evil dragons.. theres INfinite and what are the ones Nefarion was working on . twilight or something?
[6:00:32] vaironixx: but yeah raising him as an undead is possible too
[6:00:33] Krasis: The time of mortals is over
[6:00:37] ochiero_amarru: a dwan of a new era begins
[6:00:44] ochiero_amarru: *dawn
[6:00:49] conv3rge_: The time of man has come to an end.
[6:00:49] at1c: sooo how did dragons their powers back?
[6:00:58] vaironixx: i really think galkarond will be a big baddy, or some version of him
[6:01:01] Krasis: What if there is no big bad?  Just multiple smaller ones.
[6:01:05] Crypticedge: BUT whjat about the sword!!?!?!
[6:01:05] ijuki: Sparkly dragonflighr
[6:01:07] ijuki: flight*
[6:01:13] ILikeKillTheZombies: there was a leak on 4chan before game released with was accurate listing some baddies
[6:01:16] Naturalbeef: Has to be Chromatus right?
[6:01:17] ijuki: @Crypticedge What about it? Kappa
[6:01:17] Taz_85: Some evil centaur dude was behind it all the whole time?
[6:01:21] CorneliusDaDestroyer: Its prob gonna be like MoP where we only get the badies later
[6:01:22] daegoh: We dont know yet. It could be an over exagerated villian. We know nothing.
[6:01:26] KyleEverett: Nozdormu's fall to the void is something I'll be shocked doesn't happen in DF.
[6:01:34] Sielu11628: In an interview, they confirmed that there wouldn't be a big bad from start (like MoP) with, instead, smaller tribes like Sha/Mogu building up
[6:01:36] mavericks312: murozond has to make an appearance i would say
[6:01:36] vaironixx: its possible we plant a new world tree where the sword is, thats been speculated based on leaks of 9.2.5
[6:01:51] Rexialiton: "they have lost their titan-given power, which they sacrificed in order to empower the Dragon Soul. They however remain extremely powerful, ancient and wise beings."
[6:01:52] swordart2022: GIGACHAD tank taking it all ffor himself
[6:01:53] ijuki: Magni is behind it all, trust me
[6:01:59] Schloshed: Dude is trolling you
[6:02:29] Sielu11628: Definitely interested in how they bridge the story to SL with 9.2.5 and pre-patch
[6:02:31] zgag: I remember when DK's were released the battlegrounds were full of them.  I expect the same thing with the Evokers
[6:02:43] chrslp: Todays my doggos 5th birthday FeelsGoodMan
[6:02:57] vaironixx: dks were extremely overpowered on launch
[6:03:01] abracka_: diamond king is a pawn
[6:03:10] TacDuc: I had another tank almost dying to the Prototype pantheon, because they wanted to tank them all, and every time I taunted one they taunted back
[6:03:11] FranciscoTheMage: i been saying we need a raid fight where we FIGHT MAGNI for some reason.. we dont have to kill him. just subdue him. @Towelliee
[6:03:21] mavericks312: as long as we see the nozdormu heel turn
[6:03:23] Miklagard: Also maybe the loose of immortality is already redconned fifiThink
[6:03:23] ijuki: @chrslp Happy birthday to chrslp's doggo
[6:03:31] Rexialiton: So that sounds like they still have some given power of some sort i guess
[6:03:37] vaironixx: I do like the idea that azeroth itself is the big baddie of all of wow
[6:03:46] FranciscoTheMage: @Miklagard yes i think it got retconned. we all imagined it
[6:03:47] vaironixx: and thats why everyone wants it or wants it gone
[6:03:50] zgag: Evokers are called a "Hero class"  I forsee the same kind of OP that Dk's also were upon release.
[6:03:54] Sielu11628: "Venture into the ancient prison of the Primal Incarnates before their malevolent power can be unleashed against the Dragon Aspects."
[6:03:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: I want to see Chromatus
[6:04:09] KyleEverett: @zgag DH weren't that OP until 7.1
[6:04:09] Frank4LuLz: EPIC hogger
[6:04:15] vaironixx: Chromatus is HUGE, it would be like deathwing
[6:04:16] Rexialiton: no i'd say
[6:04:19] vaironixx: or even bigger
[6:04:25] vaironixx: so is galk
[6:04:30] chrslp: https://imgur.com/a/uL9VjDd
[6:04:31] CorneliusDaDestroyer: Dont know about Galac cause his bones is sitting in Northrend
[6:04:40] ijuki: Not epic hogger, LEGENDARY hogger
[6:04:49] Aurestrasz92: I would like to see Chromatus, actually
[6:04:50] vaironixx: There was a map change in northrend that removed galks bones i heard
[6:04:53] ijuki: @chrslp Woof
[6:04:57] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee In the interviews they said baddies are still to be revealed as we didnt actually know in MOP who was the big baddie at the end
[6:04:58] vaironixx: idk how to true that is
[6:05:09] Aurestrasz92: He'd be a nastier baddy than Galakrond imo
[6:05:25] CorneliusDaDestroyer: Yeah Chromatus would be cool to see
[6:05:32] pavepawns: we are probly gonna see galakrond in like 10.1-2 area
[6:05:33] vaironixx: A resurrection of galk could very well happen
[6:05:38] MILESkg21: Chromatus Kreygasm
[6:05:43] Naturalbeef: Chromatus was supposed to be in Dragon Soul but they replaced him with the shadow dragon boss for technical reasons
[6:05:50] Frank4LuLz: Ice King
[6:05:50] Shearkahn: Chromatus -  It was later defeated by the united powers of the Dragon Aspects and once more rendered inanimate (neither dead, nor undead, nor alive), and its indestructible body was stored in an arcane prison.
[6:05:58] vaironixx: maybe chromatus being the raid before galk
[6:06:31] vaironixx: galakrond eats dragons, thats how big he is
[6:06:32] FranciscoTheMage: lol those twilight maniacs been trying to rez since vanilla. its about time they got some succes fgsSpoopy
[6:06:53] Kinghorn: this world is a prison! Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[6:07:00] swordart2022: You are making stuff up caht KEKW
[6:07:06] im_n0t_jezus: probably a mini raid
[6:07:24] vaironixx: @fairplay2021 whats made up
[6:07:24] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[6:07:27] Aurestrasz92: Not really, because Chromatus was made AFTER the dragons left the Dragon Isles I think
[6:07:33] Miklagard: @fairplay2021 so does danuser KEKW
[6:07:34] xraynibba: wasnt that retconned since most of them are out now
[6:07:44] D3m0nHunt3r666: XD
[6:07:44] zgag: Imo, the ducks should have been the next hero class.  That would have made everything legit
[6:07:48] Short_Film: there is enrage in LFR?
[6:07:49] Kinghorn: impressive Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ Û†ÄÄ
[6:07:50] raldrik: thats the first I have seen that
[6:07:50] vaironixx: i wanna see how big galk is since he eats dragons
[6:07:54] swordart2022: Kick dead weight EZ
[6:07:58] CorneliusDaDestroyer: @Aurestrasz92 Agreed
[6:08:01] trivotix: Was tha a Rocky moment?
[6:08:01] Shearkahn: @Towelliee Doesnt say where - His body was indestructible, and concerned that some other dark power might try to revive Chromatus after its defeat, the dragons attempted in vain to destroy the corpse. Some powerful spell, probably woven into the dark marriage of magic and technology that had animated him in the first place protected the body from all their efforts to obliterate it. The Aspects decided to create an arcane prison similar to the ones Malygos created during the Nexus War, but bigger
[6:08:05] MILESkg21: how can people be this bad KEKW
[6:08:05] Nokterian: towRee
[6:08:13] trivotix: Nope, that was a wipe lol
[6:08:18] FranciscoTheMage: where they trolling us with the whole ducks thing.. like did they really say... we been working on webbed feet forever...
[6:08:18] D3m0nHunt3r666: I just press buttons :d
[6:08:19] chrslp: Does anyone know why there are hundreds of Chinese players on the US Sunwell PTR?
[6:08:24] Short_Film: it is 4/20, maybe everyone is high
[6:08:34] Liinxy: HeyGuys @Towelliee
[6:08:46] Evilbreed83: @Towelliee do you know what you're going to change your channel currency to yet since the expansion reveal?
[6:08:47] swordart2022: @vaironixx whole chrommatus thing would same level of stupity as Jailer out of nowhere
[6:08:48] Rexialiton: i loooooove all this dragon stuff
[6:08:55] MILESkg21: should be seperate
[6:08:56] Teknofear64: yeah worst LFR for me in a while
[6:08:59] mavericks312: or end bosses in different tiersa
[6:09:04] vaironixx: @fairplay2021 and yet jailer happened, so whats your point bud/.
[6:09:07] vaironixx: ?*
[6:09:18] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee They are too big of the baddies to put them in the same raid, but different ones, yes please
[6:09:24] N3wl34f: !yt

[6:09:32] HaloS23: @Towelliee I would hope they do Galakrond justice. That big of a lore character!!!
[6:09:33] CorneliusDaDestroyer: What if Wrathion becomes the next big bad??? :(
[6:09:43] abracka_: I swear to god if nzoth is the final boss ill rage
[6:09:52] MasonlThelNumbers: Curious to see how the Titans end up working into all of this, excited to see them again none the less
[6:09:52] Shearkahn: Galakrond was killed by the Aspects before their powers....cant be that badass
[6:09:53] swordart2022: @vaironixx well if there is same no story to him then that will be joke
[6:09:58] Oasishydra: I juste ate the best chocolate bar ever
[6:09:58] mavericks312: alah sindragosa
[6:10:07] FranciscoTheMage: why have i never heard of chromatus
[6:10:10] vaironixx: galk eats dragons, he has to be huge
[6:10:14] FranciscoTheMage: where people getting this info
[6:10:14] MILESkg21: maybe N'Zoth actually killed us monkaS
[6:10:19] rymerre: how can galakrond come back? the lich king couldnt even bring him back
[6:10:20] TacDuc: N'Zoth is probably in Wrathions dagger
[6:10:20] Taz_85: I think three twilight/undead dragon things might be a bit much. Remember, there was Ultraxion, too. He was supposed to be Deathwing's ultimate creation
[6:10:24] Rexialiton: its not the last we have seen to n'zoth
[6:10:27] Faeldric: final bosses will be Onyxia and Nefarion
[6:10:31] DiiscoViking: how am i healing mor than a holy pally

[6:10:56] swordart2022: IT scales less dead weigth less hp
[6:10:57] vaironixx: protos arent as big as dragons?
[6:11:10] FranciscoTheMage: channel points = dragonscales ?
[6:11:14] vaironixx: they look same size in wow?
[6:11:18] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Oh i think we didnt see the last of the Yogg, he must be around too LOL
[6:11:23] Shearkahn: @vaironixx Unfortunately no  However you are right that he was huge because he would grow every time he ate
[6:11:33] vaironixx: hmm thats fair
[6:11:33] Teknofear64: next time i will

[6:11:54] Morpheusx25: @vaironixx bigger far bigger
[6:12:03] swordart2022: @vaironixx bigger in image i have seen
[6:12:08] Morpheusx25: oh shit your right your first
[6:12:13] vaironixx: Yeah, but they could make him smaller somehow, leave it to blizz to change stuff
[6:12:23] Shearkahn: @vaironixx Probably bigger.   The aspects grew over time too.
[6:12:23] vaironixx: its their own lore, they do what they want
[6:12:35] swordart2022: he is dead dead :P
[6:12:36] FranciscoTheMage: OH Man.. speaking of Deathwing.. the CATA cinematic ranks high also.. seeing our world destroyed and them fitting armor on DW
[6:12:39] Rexialiton: did deathwing die die?
[6:12:40] darssia_: pls no
[6:12:42] Oasishydra: 100%
[6:12:46] swordart2022: 0 way
[6:12:47] astral_kingdom: or show up at the end of shadowlands
[6:12:48] Taz_85: Echo of Deathwing, possibly
[6:12:48] zgag: PI should be removed and something else takes it place.  Or it should be self cast only
[6:12:50] duhworks: every time you say ashen i want to say yea yea
[6:12:51] Silver_Lion: HE KNOWS
[6:12:54] Shearkahn: Ony was dead but that didnt stop Nefarian from  ressing her
[6:13:03] Faeldric: deathwing will happen through bronze dragon flight
[6:13:08] Taz_85: N'zoth's puppet, yep
[6:13:10] rymerre: if they can pull some bs to bring galakrond back then its possible
[6:13:11] mavericks312: isnt one of the new dungeons named after nelfarion
[6:13:12] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Oh i am sure Wrathion will be in search of his father somewhere and wake him up
[6:13:16] Velarn435: Malygos?
[6:13:22] RaysFTW: Warcraft has an endless amount of characters, why do they constantly bring dead ones back?
[6:13:26] FranciscoTheMage: is it nefarion or nelfarion?
[6:13:26] zgag: PI alone can make certain classes unbalanced compared to others
[6:13:29] vaironixx: infinite dragonflight will play some sort of role with infinite timeways for sure id assume
[6:13:42] Miklagard: maybe they corrupt ebenhorn fifiThink
[6:13:46] FranciscoTheMage: OMG i gotta go see if NOBLE is back on board with WOW. what did he think of it all
[6:13:49] mcgillacutty916: Bring back Ysera
[6:14:02] Taz_85: I wish that'd happen. It'd be amazing
[6:14:02] Shearkahn: Deathwing was the Earthwarden so he felt the eart which was corrupted by YoggSarron Think Saronita.
[6:14:09] Taz_85: Nyalotha needs to be a bigger deal
[6:14:10] darssia_: thats what i've been saying! nyalotha end game zone.
[6:14:35] Shearkahn: So it would be Yogg not NZoth
[6:14:47] zgag: Towelliee 2nd on dps meters and 4th on healing
[6:14:52] Miklagard: I could see it be a complete expansion, where every zone becomes more and more crazy fifiThink

[6:54:46] FrostyySnapps: im new to WoW since SL and theres so much of the story I dont know incuding this. Is there a video that explains everything or is there just so much, id have to find multiple vids to connect it all?
[6:54:48] Khlaro: Why did Anduin punch Wrathrion again?

[6:54:53] Arocian: yeah
[6:54:55] gimmlay: look into the sundering
[6:54:55] shmasherd: I literally know nothing. still.
[6:54:59] NOHITJEROME: maybe there isn't much info about the dragon isles LUL
[6:55:03] faulen: that was prior to the expansion
[6:55:05] abracka_: @Khlaro_ exposition
[6:55:06] Feeos: dragon isles because written?
[6:55:07] smashwow: spin up the nobble video
[6:55:08] just_laxus: they dont really have that much lore
[6:55:09] smashwow: let's go
[6:55:14] jmalmin: I am sure we will lear the story of the Dragon isles on the dragon isles :)
[6:55:19] at1c: there is not a whole lot about the dragon isle
[6:55:22] roflpotamus: kinda exactly like Pandaria
[6:55:25] Feeos: or in a book
[6:55:28] xraynibba: the lord of the isles is just that it was their first home
[6:55:29] Kelticlore: I dont think theres to much knowledge on the Drgaon Isles itself
[6:55:36] JumpTroopC5: Ty for the link
[6:55:36] Kisswani: KEKW https://twitter.com/MorisDreadvale/status/1516848619856568323
[6:55:38] barengunztv: What you think about no LFD honestly i think lowbies and low pop servers need it.  It was meaningful progression for dads and kids.
[6:55:48] Snabido: @Khlaro_ He helped Garrosh escape after MoP, WoD was created which lead to Gul'dan escaping to our Azeroth. He summons the Legion, Broken Shore prepatch happens, varian dies. My guess
[6:55:50] TacDuc: The Dragon Isles have been mentioned a few times, like the black scale you bring to Wrathion during BfA, the one you give the scale mentions that wrathion is looking for the isles
[6:55:54] Naturalbeef: The beginning was The Sundering
[6:56:09] juic3b0x12: Their gonna empower them to be true aspects i thing its been 430yrs since the last moon thing
[6:56:15] FenwickTT: I'm fine with them creating something new to mess up.
[6:56:25] ulisseesw: Isles where closed for thousands of years, Azerite in the water probably woke up the island and the protectors, stone dude used the beam to call the dragons back
[6:56:37] TheKitsuneAdventures: @Towelliee from what i can tell the dragon  isles  was sentto  sleep because alot of it   power  was gone but now it  over flowing  with energy and its  awaken the lands
[6:56:40] at1c: We know that was original planned zone for vanilla
[6:56:43] MILESkg21: FeelsGoodMan
[6:56:48] propwash80: is he done streaming?
[6:57:05] TacDuc: @propwash80 He wanted to watch the cinematic
[6:57:09] FranciscoTheMage: OHHHHH
[6:57:16] FranciscoTheMage: the sundering called them from the isles
[6:57:24] NOHITJEROME: stone guy is perfect for memes
[6:57:34] NOHITJEROME: he's also the new mascot of 4/20
[6:57:44] Kneckt: u will feel us return, land will start growing, then light the beacon
[6:57:45] Kelticlore: it just seems that when the SUndering was happeneing the Dragon isles became hidden
[6:57:48] lordmyer: What was the sundering from 10k years ago?
[6:57:51] Snabido: Stonechad conveys great emotions through facial
[6:57:55] duhworks: the dragons
[6:57:56] Naturalbeef: Yes
[6:57:57] TacDuc: Azerite I think
[6:57:57] Sadisticmedic: Yeah
[6:57:58] Miklagard: Couldn't they have stand somwhere a little bit protected though so that not just one survives? fifiThink
[6:57:58] rilsolo: the energy coming back
[6:57:58] xraynibba: so now that azeroth is waking back up they felt the awakening
[6:57:59] Densetsu_: The watchers sleepin for 10k years, not much watching 4head
[6:58:00] TacDuc: Look at the water
[6:58:01] pavepawns: primordials=elemental protodrakes
[6:58:02] CorneliusDaDestroyer: The dragons
[6:58:02] Kneckt: yeh the dragons being around
[6:58:03] Snabido: There's something in the water
[6:58:04] Kneckt: searching for it
[6:58:04] Bacanu34: dragons
[6:58:04] Densetsu_: 4Head
[6:58:05] madbombz_fth: Jailer pumping azeroth?
[6:58:06] at1c: WE dont know what caused it
[6:58:06] OathXP: Ok so maybe they have their power back, "you will feel our return in the waking of the land"
[6:58:09] faulen: do we know what triggered it?
[6:58:10] Carahail: I think something will happen in 2.5 that will lead to it

[6:58:11] FranciscoTheMage: i think we dont know what woke them up
[6:58:12] jmalmin: I think the jailer attacking the Azaroth did the trick.
[6:58:14] R0NGG: jailer fart
[6:58:15] Punk611: azeroth
[6:58:15] Pippinn: can we talk about the fact blizz doesn't want are money for dragonflight yet

[6:58:19] TacDuc: Try looking at the water when he wakes up
[6:58:20] Aurestrasz92: @lordmyer The original Well of Eternity during the War of the Ancients exploding was the Sundering
[6:58:23] cellarrr: The jailer, it's all part of his master plan
[6:58:23] LeideGaming: It was Magni
[6:58:26] rilsolo: ye
[6:58:27] Kneckt: yea
[6:58:27] roflpotamus: WHo are the primordials? (new raid)
[6:58:30] duhworks: they said the land will wake when we are near

[6:58:31] Naturalbeef: Yes
[6:58:31] madbombz_fth: yup

[6:58:34] Carahail: the green was the Legion
[6:58:34] Incredible_Sausage: Koranos?
[6:58:35] faulen: that was hiding the isle
[6:58:36] Punk611: it later says her awakening caused it right?
[6:58:38] Kelticlore: I think so yea

[6:59:17] Feeos: shrouded isle cohhD
[6:59:28] mayonaes: The land is finally healing
[6:59:30] Punk611: yeah azeroth waking caused it
[6:59:31] lordmyer: the sword being stabbed woke up the land 100%
[6:59:34] ulisseesw: You can see Azerite in the water if you keep watching the cinematic
[6:59:35] TacDuc: If you look at the water when he wakes up, it begins shining blue and greenish
[6:59:37] Kneckt: maybe that  big jailer beam caused something
[6:59:40] rymerre: the dragon isles have been alone to evolve on its own for 10k years
[6:59:42] lordmyer: the world being stabbed*
[6:59:43] TheTrojanFart: I‚Äôm at level 58 and I‚Äôm so done leveling rn
[6:59:47] therodd: it was the stabbening
[6:59:48] Kelticlore: isnt there supposed to be 1 more Old God some where that hasnt been faced
[6:59:51] Miklagard: But they were there very fast fifiThink

[7:00:07] CorneliusDaDestroyer: Yes :)
[7:00:08] Snabido: Maybe the sword got pulled out and started bleeding azerite toward the isles, who knows
[7:00:10] rilsolo: dont think it was her but the land waking up
[7:00:11] mayonaes: Can anyone in chat let me know if the books are worth it?
[7:00:12] Naturalbeef: That will be the 10.0 storyline. Why it came alive
[7:00:12] NOHITJEROME: there's a new sylvanas book maybe it'll explain something
[7:00:17] Kelticlore: wouldnt the orignal aspects know where dragn isles were
[7:00:17] xXSiebzehnXx: Have a good rest of your day man
