[1:42:05] Shayuki: But Maw is actually not that bad, I mean you usually just need to spend some 30min in there and then you are forced out
[1:42:05] PrimalRain: there was just shit everywhere in suramar.
[1:42:15] CDubTheRIPper: it was better with flying

[2:36:12] swampt1l: what covenant did you go Blood dk?
[2:36:23] Arhaar: kyrian or ventyhr for m+
[2:36:30] Arhaar: on prot
[2:37:00] Beave_86: do you know what the highest key you need to do for the vault is?
[2:37:04] D4rkArsenal: did he answer the cov on blood dk
[2:37:07] grizzlyg1708: the first vid i watched of towelliee was him playing a warsong gulch as prot and capping all 3 flags on a TGN youtube channel, feels like yesterday BibleThump Have a good Weekend!
[2:37:11] Karsus79: Guys, anyone know where can i find the IL charts of the mythic keys ?
[2:37:14] Johnnyboytoyy: Buying a save for 8/10 to get the higher ilevels before clearing the rest, I have a feeling its going to be hard
[2:37:31] karamelis: @Towelliee what character will u focus on for raiding u think?
[2:37:51] karamelis: or is the guild pushing hard for mythic content this time around so u will split inbetween whatever needed?
[2:38:00] Dragali: @Beave_86 You need to complete 10 M+ for the Third Chest. but it scales. Say you do 10 M+ but only 1 High Key. The First Chest Awards the Highest Ilvl reward the others are a median between the difficulties
[2:38:27] Kneckt: i get that
[2:38:30] PadidinJones: Going nude on stream @Towelliee
[2:38:49] Artivicii: i like lirik style
[2:38:51] Artivicii: raiding
[2:39:03] Shayuki: So every week you want to do 10 PvP, 10 raid bosses and 10 M+
[2:39:22] pavepawns: the good ol way of raidin
[2:39:28] pavepawns: Naaaaakeeedddd

[2:39:53] Dragali: Only if you want the most options Shayuki. Most will do less. and have 4 Options to pick from. ^^ Already better than one chest with Random Item :D
[2:39:56] Kman3107: I bet there will be nude feet!
[2:40:23] karamelis: we will hit that goal today brother

[2:40:46] Artivicii: 4Head
[2:40:53] Shayuki: @Dragali Yeah the PvP won't be necessary since that will be PvP gear(unless you're into PvP) but having options for m+ and raid gear is really strong so I'd always do it
[2:41:06] kalamari__: is there anything we can do with doublicate conduits?
[2:41:16] karamelis: @Towelliee planning to clear full mythic but not going for top guilds i suppose?
[2:41:20] quakegoogl: catleeCORN

[2:43:08] Dragali: @Shayuki Yeah. Depends on the Time you need 10M+ and Raiding takes some time. Im Happy with 2 Chests each. But i think the first week you don't really care about stats and take the item from your highest key. Will be i think the biggest upgrade no matter the stats

[3:40:43] MyJoyStick: What a terrible first boss in the raid. Pug destroyer.
[3:41:01] Streamcrush: It's the kind of boss that most people are going to hate until they can dps race it down

[3:55:40] kazaxu: wrath naxx xD
[3:55:40] thirtysilver: N'zoth was
[3:55:50] Shayuki: And Castle Nathria is really cool in itself, too. I mean the whole Revendreth zone is essentially the castle and its surroundings

[3:57:23] Vanhoek: I hope if they do .. do raids per cov that they do a Trail of crusade style of raid for maldraxxas
[3:57:27] Lanthor: with mini-raids one per zone would be achievable
[3:57:37] jure__: id say we have a bigger chance of having a mythic only dungeon than raid
[3:57:41] whoisqnx: naxx out agane PogChamp
[3:57:43] Shayuki: For a 2-3 boss raid, Bastion makes most sense to me
[3:57:52] pavepawns: i would find it cool to fight a surviving first one as last boss
[3:57:55] Kalistraza: @Towelliee sylvanas boss?
[3:58:05] PracTlKaL: a Ruby Sanctum LUL
[3:58:07] Todmeister9000: maybe Sylvanas will be the last boss towQueen
[3:58:11] thirtysilver: @Towelliee In the Maw you cannot ride your mounts. Maw, sounds like Ma, which is a nickname for Mom/Mother. She also doesn't let you ride your bike in the house. coincidence? I think not.

[6:25:22] dandingo86: 8 years
[6:25:43] Armdel: just seems to be QoL and cosmetic stuff
[6:25:44] msmester1: 3,5k anima for cosmetic fels so bad when a mount is 5k

[6:38:40] theoriginalzinng: i used lots of shift and ctrl modifiers
[6:38:43] CoastalMike: And the naga trinity has easy detachable side panels. I swap mine to the standard two side buttons for FPS games

[6:40:25] Throfur: This is the last part, just killing a dude
[6:40:50] Dionaut: I miss my naga man. Switched from razor to logitech to try them out... But damn i miss it. The naga is way lighter and the buttons feel better.

[7:42:36] griffdog125: lol opps
[7:42:39] Kromede: use bandages
[7:42:51] catlinv: front right
[7:43:00] Charocalypse: why did the healer have a solo portal
[7:43:02] saint__: @Towelliee Do you think leveling as a DH tank is the way to go?
[7:43:11] StrengthCoachJoe: Morning Towelliee, how was your weekend brother?
[7:43:15] Motivess: oh, there is a timer? never took that long b4
[7:43:27] ClarticusTv: what is the difficulty?
[7:43:27] Clicklesly: Assuming people actually went to assigned portals is pretty optimistic ^^
[7:43:33] xghostyyx: de other day - when we started
[7:43:34] catlinv: @saint__ I can tell u it's rly fun
[7:43:53] griffdog125: lol inside hes furious
[7:43:58] Kromede: mystique ClarticusTv
[7:44:10] Kromede: MiniK
[7:44:12] TheCloudbreaker: This a +10? Lol
[7:44:15] saint__: @catlinv Have the nerfed their damage yet, or is it still as powerful from during the launch/marathon?
[7:44:22] ClarticusTv: ive never done mythic dungeons before any tips?
[7:44:23] BearOfLight: @saint__ for DH, yeah Tank is clearly better rn. If doing Threads of Fate, Tank or Heal specs will definitely get you there faster. If doing story campaign to level, you'll get there no matter what you do.
[7:44:33] Perseus_IRL: make sure you check out @Towelliee you can watch SpaceX Starship SN8 launch tomorrow during maintainance...
[7:44:36] nokkopede: @TheCloudbreaker no just m0 :D
[7:44:36] catlinv: @saint__ No nerf yet
[7:44:46] squirtsreturn: Is that a bourbon county?
[7:44:48] griffdog125: would be fine if palli wasn't eating all mechanics
[7:44:56] catlinv: I still have top dps on most add pulls
[7:45:01] Kromede: ConcernDoge you say
[7:45:03] TheCloudbreaker: I was just making a joke cuz he has people eating mechanics
[7:45:04] saint__: @BearOfLight Why does tank or heal specs get through Threads of Fate faster?
[7:45:05] Vivelli: does doing dps speed up the portals showing up?
[7:45:13] omezy23: I’m sick af guys hopefully it’s not covid
[7:45:16] saint__: @catlinv Thanks for the info.
[7:45:23] HoFChaos: the pally needs to be using Holy Shock and Word of Glory
[7:45:23] omezy23: BrainSlug
[7:45:24] Gamborg: Theres been so many fights where you dont have to dps at the "avoidance" stage. But people tunnelvision those numbers xD
[7:45:27] feherlofia123: @clarticustv consider m0 the same heroics before mythic was implemented.
[7:45:37] ClarticusTv: kick?
[7:45:45] bobby031784: the mele attack can be prevented with spell reflect as a warrior
[7:45:47] FischBowlGaming: This is painful to watch.
[7:45:52] Effin_Steffin: Duck Dodge Dip Dive & Dodge
[7:45:58] griffdog125: can't kick its a m0
[7:45:59] jure__: its the last boss, kicking now is ...

[7:46:51] BearOfLight: @saint__ Purely because dungeons are the fastest way to level in Threads. Pick up your "Help the Cov" quests, run the dungeons, that'll leave them all around 90%, do a little more and turn in. So Tank/Heals just means better queues
