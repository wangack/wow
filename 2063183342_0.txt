[4:30:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: It could be a B-tier overall, I'm not the most impartial since I watch Mes do great things with unholy pretty often
[4:30:58] atoker: honestly it's the set bonus being mediocre and the lack of vers from set pieces that makes it vulnerable in my opionion

[4:41:22] atoker: your dh should be competitive enough for tourneys ... you're always topping meters
[4:41:42] BalancePK_: FeelsStrongMan
[4:43:51] gone_wickedtv: hey mes waht is the top 3 combs for dh is stuck atm 2.1 hard to push :/
[4:44:19] Landrysdad: Dh/destro/Hpal feels crazy strong
[4:44:24] gone_wickedtv: me ww and me warri olso at 2.1 :/ mmr 2.3
[4:44:55] gone_wickedtv: @landrysdad thx for the info
[4:45:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Destro is way better than it was at the start of Dragonflight, I remember those guys were on life support back then
[4:45:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrong tier set, ouch
[4:45:49] eMBeaR64oz: woulda been nice if there was a pvp and pve tier set vote or something
[4:46:01] eMBeaR64oz: or f it, just give em all
[4:46:05] eMBeaR64oz: and have ppl chose
[4:46:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those fire portals are so freakish when like three are up
[4:46:37] Landrysdad: I wish Hpal was this tier again
[4:46:37] atoker: @eMBeaR64oz access to all the tier sets would be pretty rad
[4:46:58] eMBeaR64oz: then could mix and match some 2 sets to make some crazy combos
[4:47:04] eMBeaR64oz: would be fun, like corruption ish
[4:47:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: That looks about right, for a current tier list
[4:48:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would probably put ret on the same tier as unholy
[4:48:46] waitimdesyncd: Yo mes did you see the rogue kick macro?
[4:49:33] H3llscreamQQ: That kinda mean good balance by devs ... almost

[4:51:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the devs do try to balance things, and it's a tough job overall

[4:52:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't know how DH did dodge nerfs for PvP, but pretty much all the specs are playable, especially on the PvE side of things
[4:52:26] Landrysdad: I might be crazy, but swear dh is the best melee in game
[4:52:44] Landrysdad: might also be just an Hpal thing
[4:53:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: MDI is this weekend and most of the teams are going to have the same or similar meta comps, but in the game overall people can play what they like
[4:54:05] MentaldeadTV: @Landrysdad What a shocker
[4:57:32] waitimdesyncd: That rogue macro video is giving me a lot of ideas to combine Metamorphis with kicks, retreat etc. Even vengeful with meta

[5:05:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: What really gets me in SOD balance is that warlock tank does more damage than a bunch of the DPS specs LUL
