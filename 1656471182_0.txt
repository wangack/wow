[1:08:48] robtest: it seems to vary from bracket to bracket... in the 70s bracket in WotLK for instance... horde is just lazy and typically loses because they don't take Balinda...
[1:08:52] Lonertx: +1
[1:08:55] vycvyper92: say the word "premade" once.
[1:09:04] septiv: my cough

[1:10:30] CovahRedro: More good players went horde, which means horde geared up fast so have better gear. and item level is 1% more power and there is like 30 item level difference.

[2:23:14] Ospreybravo18: @dokruteny So there's TECHNICALLY ways that you can get cars in under the 25 year mark.  There are people who have R34 GTR's but they can't drive them on the road.  From a big car nerd to you, I promise you that the majority of people only import cars after 25 years.
[2:23:17] zargon2876: World servers are down??

[2:27:07] magegamegg: wheres ur spritbloom
[2:27:26] dokruteny: @Ospreybravo18 ye thats like the downside of it but, in US you can swap any engine you want.. here in EU if we change only the exhaust tip and got busted by police they can take our cars and then we must register the whole car from stock etc etc, its very hard there.. but some people like me, (i removed DPF) if i will be catch one day it will be funny to see their reaction, everything illegal on my engine right now but works very well and its healthy
[2:27:27] Lsneakyness: bullying that rogue how dare you!

[2:30:40] Ospreybravo18: @dokruteny But yeah we have a lot of things we can do with cars here.  It's just really hard to import cars and have them be road legal.  That's why most people just wait the full 25 as then you essentially just find a reputable importer and go from there.

[2:33:25] Clern: monks in the beginning of mop were awful
[2:33:31] dokruteny: @Ospreybravo18 ye i hope you can drive the car one day irl, but in my opinion its better to take diesel version. might sound stup!d because its a Coupe sporty car, everyone will take gasoline engine but the reality is, all TSI (gasoline) have oil leaking or oil consuption problems and its so easy to break the engine by normal safe driving, people have replaced whole engine in shorter than 60k miles which is very sad
