[7:45:18] imxilz: imxilz subscribed with Prime. 
[7:45:23] PBRbiter: @Touristos3 you can play it without any addons, they just help. and they updated the default UI and it's a lot more customizable.
[7:45:28] Nemereth: you ll be fine but you will add them for sure later, just improves your overall experience and is all customizable @Touristos3
[7:45:30] OverlordBert: @Touristos3 Only problem is you will find high content hard without knowing what to do
[7:45:32] MickyFresc: @Touristos3 a lot of world first raiders even use mostly default UI, like Gingi for example
[7:45:47] thenewguy176: those lightning effects are neat
[7:45:57] solstice1407: Top dam shroudboi
[7:45:57] MVPStabby: @Touristos3 yeah its all easier with addons. and tbh you put yourself at a disadvantage without, unless your playing casually then it doesnt matter.
[7:46:10] hate_xyz: monkaW
[7:46:14] ronnando27: h
[7:46:15] Nemereth: good thing about addons is you add them in literally less than 5 seconds same for uninstalling, only /Reload in game and done
[7:46:16] MickyFresc: @OverlordBert I think it's mitigated now since a lot of abilities show what you need to do better? I heard that for dragonflight it's better
[7:46:34] MVPStabby: yeah addons in wow are super quick and easy tbh
[7:46:34] ronnando27: how many bosses does vault have?
[7:46:36] Astor4k: I use to play with a bunch of QoL non raid addons but with the new UI I don't use any of them. I still use raid based ones of course
