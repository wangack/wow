[1:44:47] hirengames: sometimes i see a triple number, is that like 3 hits at one time
[1:45:39] saftkalle: @hirengames the white numbers are his autohits, since he is dualwielding they can hit at the same time. The yellow numbers are his skillattacks

[2:48:24] xurelto: its just like the plastic bag system, doesn't work if you charge people 5 cents for a bag. instead we should be rewarding people who do follow rules. Give everyone $1000 for testing negative and you'll see people isolating like they are a neckbeard
