[0:27:09] hogslasher: @cdewx what player do you have going against the most? or even class?
[0:27:09] knappster15: @privategravy agree
[0:27:11] zachgamegodx: pres gonna be amazing next week right
[0:27:15] knappster15: So excited for pres next week man
[0:27:32] shredder1111: did u see patch notes? why are they buffing pres mana costs by 10%
[0:27:39] exizt_01: what are the changes? does anyone have the link
[0:28:11] killerdrizzle: I just want that rdru guide so I can get a better understanding on how much mastery I need on rdru, and vers, and what i can craft haste/mastery on my pieces
[0:28:23] knappster15: Patch notes says it's getting buffed from 10%>20%. There's nothing in pvp section saying its reduced?
[0:28:24] shredder1111: the notes say Grace Period now increases your healing by 10/20% on targets with your Reversion (was 5/10%). so they didnt change the text but on the ptr its 15
[0:28:45] zachgamegodx: the official notes released today it’s gonna be 20% additionally there will be a new bonus on the talent under energy loop that decreases the cost of maby heals by 20%
[0:28:59] zachgamegodx: so mana should be same or better
[0:29:04] wackpoetic: where dem notes
[0:29:12] shredder1111: tbh i think the ptr probably more accurate than the notes
[0:29:13] zachgamegodx: many
[0:29:23] shogun2022: whats your opinion on Precognition mechanic
[0:29:23] wackpoetic: wait if there's a new talent under energy loop does that mean you lose the reversion duration?
[0:29:27] zachgamegodx: what are you talking about you have it rn
[0:29:35] zachgamegodx: it’s required for stasis
[0:29:35] shredder1111: Timeless Magic now also affects Temporal Anomaly, and reduces the mana cost of Reversion, Temporal Anomaly, Echo, and Time Dilation by 10/20% (was just duration at 15/30%).
[0:29:57] truhan89: notes are wrong ye
[0:30:06] wackpoetic: I swear it's so scuffed that the only notes they had for Pres were the mana & Essence Burst on Reversion casts
[0:30:20] wackpoetic: Crit gonna be OP on Pres now for Reversion duration
[0:30:21] brewtank: @cdewx catch me with ravager next patch, BLADES OF LIGHT!
[0:30:24] zephylias1901: Make Rshaman great again
[0:30:31] Rodneysaurus_: Can someone link notes, I don't see them anywhere
[0:30:43] zachgamegodx: no nerfs to duration
[0:30:43] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:30:49] zachgamegodx: pure addition Chuck
[0:30:54] zachgamegodx: it’s getting added
[0:31:07] knappster15: its 30% duration and now 20% mana reduction will be added
[0:31:28] knappster15: Patch notes wording is scuffed then
[0:31:41] wackpoetic: that doesn't feel that good, those aren't your high mana cost spells were they?
[0:31:53] knappster15: I feel like we reapply reversion a lot as it is tho
[0:31:57] shredder1111: often the guys writing the notes are lagging behind the actual people changing things on ptr
[0:32:11] wackpoetic: Always feels like you go OOM casting Living Flame
[0:32:17] killerdrizzle: 14s
[0:32:25] saploi69: How's the Smourne?
[0:32:28] exizt_01: anyone have the link to the notes

[0:32:30] exizt_01: or can dm it to me
[0:32:53] shredder1111: @exizt_01 wowhead 5 hours ago
[0:32:59] truhan89: its sad that they nerfed the healing buff
[0:33:03] killerdrizzle: my reversion duration is 15.6
[0:33:29] wackpoetic: Essence Burst may now trigger from casts of Reversion. Mana cost of most spells increased by 10%. Grace Period now increases your healing by 10/20% on targets with your Reversion (was 5/10%). Timeless Magic now also affects Temporal Anomaly, and reduces the mana cost of Reversion, Temporal Anomaly, Echo, and Time Dilation by 10/20% (was just duration at 15/30%).
[0:33:52] zachgamegodx: pres is good on mana rn I thought?
[0:33:53] truhan89: notes ofc
[0:33:57] knappster15: PTR might be scuffed tho
[0:33:59] wackpoetic: https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24052633/dragonflight-seeds-of-renewal-content-update-notes#item10
[0:34:45] wackpoetic: My 0 haste full crit Prevoker always has Reversions up LuL
[0:34:47] killerdrizzle: but youre also proccing essence bursts off reversion now
[0:34:51] boocraft1992: where do you see these patch changes? i dont see anything on mmo-champ
[0:35:03] wackpoetic: boocraft1992 I literally just posted it
[0:35:06] felgazer: SOD looks empty compared to Retail...
[0:35:10] Alvendo: so after holy priest useless in m+ now the evoker get started useless Kappa
[0:35:11] Cybernytez: is gearing in cata easy guys?
[0:35:14] killerdrizzle: yeah thats what im thinking. depending on how often it bursts off reversion. but as often as you use it, you should get value from it
[0:35:16] casskai: we ret gaming?
[0:35:16] truhan89: i think makes logit that notes are wrong over ptr sadly
[0:35:20] truhan89: logic*
[0:35:56] danclona023: how do u even heal in retail man? just feels so unrewarding
[0:35:56] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:36:42] Fros365: @Cybernytez According to Ven, only in season 1, PVP gear is good, otherwise you have to raid to get the best gear
[0:37:22] zachgamegodx: maybe you can play spheres now
[0:37:28] zachgamegodx: gold spheres on dragon
[0:37:51] wackpoetic: zachgamegodx Temporal Anomaly? Costs too much mana imo
[0:38:02] waffleberryx: ive had smourne break so many traps on me
[0:38:06] zachgamegodx: anamoly
[0:38:09] waffleberryx: when they cleave off my partner
[0:38:17] zachgamegodx: @wackpoetic yeah but they nerfed the cost
[0:38:27] knappster15: no way temp anomaly is good in arena
[0:38:42] killerdrizzle: and cost like 11-12% of your mana
[0:38:47] stluxy: chat, what's fastest wat to firelands as ally in retail?

[0:41:48] wackpoetic: zachgamegodx temporal anomaly can definitely be fun with CDR and Flow State to get all your empowers spells back, but idk if it's good enough for how many points it costs

[2:57:00] jasuvex: agree*
[2:57:10] itz_killjoy: dh nerfs  have put them below wars in terms of damage, and they already have 0 utility so no, ww is not better either at all, dk is close but they dont provice the utility or damage a war does
[2:57:18] jasuvex: stop coping
[2:57:46] knappster15: what dh is doing less dps than war LUL sounds like a skill issue

[3:11:09] chinchin23: whens thi sseason end
[3:11:11] ChilledsDogTreats: problem is when your hardest hitting ability only does like 2/3s of an Ele blast, kinda hard to kill with
[3:11:31] FoxiekittenWoW: @mikey0105 its bis for most melees, but its not by much prob only 1-3% better than the verdant one
[3:11:53] mikey0105: @FoxiekittenWoW thanks for the info
[3:12:46] FoxiekittenWoW: @mikey0105 but its only becaues its higher ilvl, the effect of the weapon is essentially useless in arena and you should never use it.

[7:15:56] armin_ed: See I think its funny though that  rogue mage can do all that cc and what not, but DK/Dh can do random cc and win still
[7:15:57] aod0311x: you and mes go back and forth so much, its kind of funny how much shit yo give each other

[7:26:40] Zerolol123: as they were before golden guardians and before gosu crew
[7:26:53] spagolie: @Pontacos world quests, but its just not worth the time buy a token
[7:27:17] spagolie: theres usually a lot of wqs with 500+ gold, and the flying ones that give a 500g bag
[7:27:55] Pontacos: You're probably right
[7:28:10] Pontacos: I mined and gathered herbs for 45 mines and got 2k gold lol

[7:41:59] HolyXct: I love how kidney is 5 second stun and blind is 4 second lol

[7:51:49] Hammer90x: rather, why do they choose not to

[7:53:05] lykaionxd17: rogue class identity is being op
[7:53:08] fatuglystupidbald: sub rogue has been disgusting for like 4 years consecutively right?
[7:53:09] SirBeaverTeeth: has there been an expansion where sub aren't crazy good?
[7:53:37] Hammer90x: the issue with their tools is it's not hard to use.... there's not a large skill cap in spamming cheap shot
[7:53:49] Qyzme: i guess, this game need only 1 DR category called CC - after 3 cc's done, you are immune to ANY CC for 30sec. downscale dmg a bit. and its actualy fun to play ^^
[7:53:51] paladin_playsxd: happy new year cdew
[7:53:51] tichoka: remove shadow dance so rogues can spam their 10k backstab
[7:53:53] Pontacos: Rogues have never not been good
[7:54:07] fatuglystupidbald: s12 mop was the last time they were bad LMFAO
[7:54:08] Koeyyyy: @Qyzme i wouldnt be against that lol
[7:54:17] DoubleFreakTV: But we cant nerf cc more, its allready just like playing a BG kinda
[7:54:26] glaidsz: thats why mop was best expac
[7:54:31] svantelorenzo: glad mount showoff plzz ❤️
[7:54:47] tom2012euloljkeu: seaosn 2 mop was good tho
[7:54:58] DoubleFreakTV: Remove gauge tho, if you cant sap the blind, then you shouldnt have a lifeline
[7:55:01] DoubleFreakTV: atleast for sub
[7:55:02] Yoskexz: cloak and dagger FeelsStrongMan
[7:55:23] jmyxl: There were 2 weeks in BFA S4 when conflict and strife were broken were rogues were bad KEKW
[7:55:29] Ophinis: best glad mount till date?
[7:55:31] svantelorenzo: your favoriter and the worse?
[7:55:32] fatuglystupidbald: rogue is just poorly designed. i don’t think its possible go balance something damage wise when thejr tool kit is that insane
[7:55:40] paladin_playsxd: I think verdant gladiator mount is the best of this expansions glad mounts so far
[7:55:42] tom2012euloljkeu: @Yoskexz what was that again i rememebr the name and it being op
[7:56:03] Backrub: how would you order the xpacs in terms of enjoy-ability for u
[7:56:06] HolyXct: My favourite glad mount is SL season 1! And least favourite are all the BFA glad mounts
[7:56:27] fatuglystupidbald: @tom2012euloljkeu each ambush in shadow dance would act like a shadow step
[7:56:27] tichoka: But rage trades uptime dmg for burst dam, u wont see sub pumping 110k dps nonstop like DH DK :)
[7:56:59] tom2012euloljkeu: @fatuglystupidbald oh shit ye i remember
[7:57:39] paladin_playsxd: @DruidFlames I do like the SL glad mounts, the cosmic glad mount is my favorite of those
[7:57:39] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[7:57:43] Protties: it’s cool that sub can win on its own - but the prob is that they cant be punished for doing whatever they want
[7:57:51] fatuglystupidbald: anyone remember the ranged rogue spec that was op for like a month in the start of mop?
[7:58:08] tichoka: @fatuglystupidbald It was Shuriken toss talent :)
[7:58:09] fatuglystupidbald: shuriken toss deadly throw out dpsing melee rogue
[7:58:22] HolyXct: @paladin_playsxd ye cosmic is my second favourite. I almost got it too :/ was 37/50 wins but sadly didn't have the time to finish the push. So only got season 1
[7:59:29] tom2012euloljkeu: @fatuglystupidbald ye rekcful and conrad used to play double shurikan rogue, bis content

[8:04:51] Hammer90x: don't say it too loud, blizz would do it
[8:04:51] Stepbrogue: I think a 10 sec kidney would be balanced
[8:05:01] razer39: They need to give sub rog red buff and also killing spree because they do so low dmg
[8:05:02] Mcaveryst: Remember old tyrannical subterfuge where they could teleport CS when they danced
[8:05:10] xkhyrozx: that's a deep dark fantasy
[8:05:18] Sheepyou: i would be happy with aoe kidney stun
[8:05:21] fatuglystupidbald: bring back 35% ms while you’re at it as well
[8:05:24] inordinator: bring back mace stun
[8:05:33] Explicitx: i also feel like duel should be a bit longer, some times i dont have enough time to finish my business
[8:05:40] Solushun: i think you should get 2 stacks of kidney shot, and if you stun someone while someone else is already in the kidney, it gives you back 1 charge and increases your damage by 200% for 8 seconds. :)
[8:05:49] Sheepyou: make shadow duel 10 seconds
[8:06:12] fatuglystupidbald: deadly throw kick too
[8:06:19] fatuglystupidbald: and burst of speed

[8:06:48] PeptoAbysmal: good wine is the cheap wine
[8:06:56] HolyXct: What was the rogue self heal ability called? The one that you could spend combo points on without a cd and it would give you a HoT
