[0:49:42] krutogaming: hopefully
[0:49:49] Morgonbladet: @krutogaming This is what I saved for Pog
[0:49:54] Collnaris: YES
[0:50:00] Collnaris: GIVE ME MAGE TOWER FORMS
[0:50:09] Taylor131313: I'm sad for anyone who plays feral in general
[0:50:10] TheresNoneLeft: same with the demon warglaives
[0:50:11] AlfredK: They should add the mage tower back with the old rewards AND new rewards
[0:50:12] Wardrick7: i am so sad for anyone playing feral
[0:50:12] Saint_Valravn: I suffered through feral mage tower thinking I'd get the appearance lol
[0:50:14] Collnaris: or how about played on NA at the time zzzzzzzzzzzz
[0:50:16] krutogaming: @Morgonbladet yeee click yourt link
[0:50:18] Lorrdzik: just put them back to MT so you still need to earn them
[0:50:19] TheresNoneLeft: those fire glaives are the nicest
[0:50:20] Aegis_2566: Something Blizzard can do is, lets say you play multiple chars and get glad on 2, you get a special quest for a new npc that sells them for saddles
[0:50:30] TheresNoneLeft: demon hunter
[0:50:31] Saint_Valravn: dh
[0:50:32] Aegis_2566: The glad mounts
[0:50:36] gunzpewpew: I am waiting every single blue post for MT to come back so I can get my rogue dagger. I was travelling at the time and working abroad
[0:50:49] Bloodmatch: I want polar bear anniesThump
[0:50:57] Mikkikiki16: Hello Annie.
[0:51:00] Collnaris: thoughts on challenge mode sets, if they could come back as recolors?
[0:51:01] seamuscg: They could do like league where the original version of the mounts/skin have a special effect to show it was the OG
[0:51:02] TheresNoneLeft: @Saint_Valravn i commend you name color!
[0:51:08] Alastor7783: another 50 wins at 2400 rating and you get saddle
[0:51:11] Alastor7783: seems reasonable
[0:51:13] Annies_Bot: For stream highlights, cosplays and vlogs, check out Annie's youtube! anniesHype youtube.com/anniefuchsia anniesHi
[0:51:24] Collnaris: yes
[0:51:28] TheresNoneLeft: yes!
[0:51:39] Kepi_w: Glad mounts should be for glad players only ye, if i see people at 1.6 running around with glad mounts im not rly playing the game anymore
[0:51:45] Saint_Valravn: @TheresNoneLeft SeemsGood same
[0:51:49] jokuTM: Sadge
[0:51:57] Alastor7783: @Kepi_w ok, bye peepoBye
[0:51:59] Collnaris: i just want my unattainable stuff from NA on EU too PepeHands
[0:51:59] bozzzna: after 3+ expansions unobtainalbe stuff should be available
[0:52:02] Wardrick7: then they most likely would make it a separate mount with glow and fix none of those issues
[0:52:04] Mikkikiki16: Can you play Palworld?
[0:52:06] Taylor131313: lunaPeek
[0:52:06] Hasan_Lurker: lunaPeek
[0:52:07] Geoffku: that luna LULW
[0:52:08] Ata5ll: Agreed, I would be sad if suddenly everyone runs around with challenge mode gear from back in the day EVEN when I still want mage tower stuff
[0:52:16] Taylor131313: Luna so cute
[0:52:17] Viuh: i don't pvp -> cannot get glad mounts, but have accepted that fact.
[0:52:21] Taylor131313: probably time for cat walk
[0:52:22] Andy76swe: I think one of your fans is having an episode ;p
[0:52:26] Collnaris: throw them a particle effect
[0:52:31] gunzpewpew: I wish they made it so you can transmog legendaries if you got them during it's active patch
[0:52:40] Taylor131313: I wouldn't, I only wear slutmogs
[0:52:50] Azureynn: slutmogs is bis
[0:52:54] Collnaris: i would love to get the druid challenge set tbh
[0:52:56] Viuh: DxCat
[0:53:03] ClutchMedic: i would probably quit if challenge mode gear came back to the public haha
[0:53:13] seamuscg: FirstTimeChatter
[0:53:15] Collnaris: ye that was me Kappa
[0:53:16] Artiiz: I wanna get the MoP challenge mode druid set
[0:53:22] Alastor7783: @ClutchMedic why ?
[0:53:23] Taylor131313: CLASSIC
[0:53:24] TheresNoneLeft: oof
[0:53:27] krutogaming: can you still do that ?
[0:53:29] Geoffku: is it time to check him again? PepeLaugh
[0:53:33] Taylor131313: how do you buy an account with current glad?
[0:53:34] Collnaris: a druid that's a swiper? monkaW
[0:53:35] cptdrage: that u can get the mount but not the achieve would solve it
[0:53:39] Lorrdzik: then good he would quit LUL
[0:53:40] TheresNoneLeft: agreed!
[0:53:45] Collnaris: yes bring it back
[0:53:49] Artiiz: yeah thats a bit yikes saying that
[0:53:58] Ata5ll: @Collnaris They did make slight variations of that :p they nothing close to the appeal but well :p
[0:54:07] ScrewOnTheLoose: Agreed! Some people (myself included) just started to play WoW and have missed A LOT.
[0:54:23] NoName6834: anniesExplainingHow
[0:54:24] Taylor131313: Crungo that's shady
[0:54:30] skibbatv: back in the day, there was no mount journal to learn mounts even, even easier to take
[0:54:31] Aegis_2566: I complimented some dk the other day for having the CM set, he said he would love to have my t3 but too expensive
[0:54:33] LuckyStrikerBE: people do that :/
[0:54:42] Geoffku: you know this pretty well somehow Kapp
[0:54:44] Collnaris: you can do all that, but i can't have NA stuff on EU Crungo
[0:54:48] cptdrage: when u merge acc u get mounts combined
[0:54:50] bozzzna: good to know, too bad I'm never getting glad pepeDeflate
[0:54:50] Ata5ll: That's kind of the point, you were there and got epic shiat, too bad you weren't that's what makes those things so epic
[0:54:54] ClutchMedic: @Alastor7783 Well, i got every class challenge mode done, and back then that was a journey, its nice to see people be like oh man cmode gear nice, plus being one of very few accounts with every cmode also feels good
[0:54:55] bennet_r: why does it matter?
[0:55:04] Marovia: because they get money from the new account
[0:55:35] Taylor131313: weren't glad mounts character wide until a couple years ago or something
[0:55:40] Taylor131313: or am I thinking of something else
[0:55:45] skibbatv: @Taylor131313 yes
[0:55:46] TheresNoneLeft: character bound VS account bound?
[0:55:54] Artiiz: @Alastor7783 That's like saying you don't want the game to evolve
[0:56:04] Azureynn: is luna hungy or just looking for attention? rar
[0:56:09] Collnaris: region bound Moodge
[0:56:10] TheresNoneLeft: ah i see.
[0:56:10] Alastor7783: 4 sooon
[0:56:11] ClutchMedic: @Artiiz Not even remotely accurate on that statement
[0:56:11] Alastor7783: war-bound
[0:56:16] Azureynn: xdd
[0:56:25] xXRenMikaelsonXx: She's nice and plump.
[0:56:28] Artiiz: @Artiiz Of course it is, you want legacy things to be locked to the past and not being obtainable anymore
[0:56:31] Marovia: they should be just gifts, we got the tech now
[0:56:41] rafmarimon: where is your accent from?
[0:56:52] Swiggyswoo_: Just bring back recolors for things like challenge mode and keep the original colors unobtainable
[0:56:53] TheresNoneLeft: i miss my fuzz butts, oddly enough im just realising my cats name was anny! XD
[0:57:02] Collnaris: @Swiggyswoo_ exactly
[0:57:02] rafmarimon: 🇸🇪 🇸🇪
[0:57:10] Aegis_2566: @anniefuchsia the other day i saw a dk with the cm set, saying that I'd love to have it, he said the same about my t3 peepoOkay
[0:57:10] EnGronAnka: how come your english is so good if you are from Sweden?
[0:57:13] Ata5ll: Can't make everyone happy, that's what ruins games, not being authentic
[0:57:15] TheresNoneLeft: had two cats izzy and anny
[0:57:18] Artiiz: @Swiggyswoo_ They already have that with ur class order hall set in Legion but it doesn't look nearly as good
[0:57:20] Alastor7783: but make the new recolors unobtainable to ppl who have the originals !
[0:57:26] ClutchMedic: I think fortnite had a pretty good way of doing it, when they brought back exclusive skins, the OG owners got an extra variant
[0:57:35] Collnaris: and it's trash version
[0:57:36] Taylor131313: the ikea version
[0:57:38] Marovia: we can get mounts directly into our collection as gifts, like when blizz give us mounts
[0:57:39] heavyharmonies: Annie = KKool
[0:57:42] Artiiz: It should still look good
[0:57:43] Ata5ll: @Alastor7783 lol
[0:57:49] TheresNoneLeft: 100% agree there!
[0:57:50] whizakaz: hello whizW
[0:57:53] Aegis_2566: Don't keep anything unobtainable
[0:57:56] Taylor131313: whizW
[0:58:02] Collnaris: yep
[0:58:02] ClutchMedic: @Alastor7783 with this logic, nobody should get the OG sets rofl

[0:58:16] Alastor7783: @ClutchMedic that's your logic, homie :)
[0:58:16] NoName6834: when are you going back to finish them? anniesCopium
[0:58:32] ClutchMedic: @Alastor7783 its quite literally the opposite
[0:58:36] Azureynn: akshuallyyy
[0:58:36] Collnaris: aktually Nerdge
[0:58:38] Taylor131313: xddnerd 👆
[0:58:39] Ata5ll: nah, make a Wlock CM without Fel glow ;D
[0:58:40] NoName6834: EARTHQUAKE
[0:58:42] bYTEfROG: actually Annie, I prefer the new version
[0:58:46] Artiiz: @Alastor7783 You're literally saying the opposite though so why are you mad at that lmfao
[0:58:52] bennet_r: I like the new version more too
[0:58:53] Celc1us: need some work on your nerd voice anniesP
[0:59:05] Swiggyswoo_: Would look better poggSpin
[0:59:05] Ata5ll: Purple would be cool
[0:59:10] TheresNoneLeft: i LOVE red outfits! they work perfect with my SL s3 ksm mount
[0:59:36] Marovia: at least they can get a new bear from the emerald dream, imagine if they actually continue supporting artifact skins
[0:59:44] gunzpewpew: I think that they should reintroduce previously exclusive items but make it really challanging, even more challanging the the original means of getting them
[0:59:45] Collnaris: i just want another chance at the challenge mode sets
[0:59:51] Jamertamer: 10yrs
[0:59:52] Ata5ll: Here's an idea, give a unique weapon just for 1 expansion
[0:59:53] Artiiz: Aware dont google
[0:59:54] Taylor131313: 10 years ago xddDespair

[1:00:01] Celc1us: whats wrong with leather brown and steel gray? DansGame
[1:00:05] skibbatv: 2012 was 12 years ago
[1:00:06] Aegis_2566: Over 10 years ago
[1:00:11] Collnaris: back when mop came out, i wasn't as dedicated to WoW as i am now LUL
[1:00:14] Alastor7783: @AnnieFuchsia if they make CM recolors, they should make them unobtainable for people who have the old ones - it's only fair NODDERS
[1:00:17] TheresNoneLeft: i have a bunch of color schemes for my characters, usually the main are blue, green and red, and i guess yollow.
[1:00:18] Collnaris: i was in middle of Uni
[1:00:22] Geoffku: @skibbatv Aware
[1:00:24] kashynia: hellooo everyone! :D
[1:00:32] gunzpewpew: It doesnt even have to do ANYTHING to do with the original method in my opinion. Could be long grindy achievements or stuff
[1:00:34] skibbatv: @kashynia Heyge hey there
[1:00:35] Collnaris: OMEGALUL
[1:00:40] Collnaris: why would they do that LUL
[1:00:43] TheresNoneLeft: lol -> yollow <-
[1:00:46] Ata5ll: Thanks god she disagrees on that lol
[1:00:46] Artiiz: The difficulty for MT nowadays is like 1000x times harder than it used to be in Legion though no?
[1:00:46] PneumaWHU: I don't see why they need to remove things in the first place
[1:00:48] Annies_Bot: Go to https://sdqk.me/2b2vYFS0/IOrh6nbp and use code GSQANNIFJANFBFL to get free breakfast for life with HelloFresh! One breakfast item per box while subscription is active. anniesHype
[1:01:03] Aegis_2566: Nah it's not harder
[1:01:10] Taylor131313: not that much harder, but you could outgear it in legion while you really can't now
[1:01:17] Swiggyswoo_: Nah if it's challenge mode tmog make it related in some way, so top 1% m+ score or something
[1:01:20] Aegis_2566: The tank challenge got nerfed for many specs
[1:01:20] Artiiz: Yeah you used to be able to just outgear everything
[1:01:23] Swiggyswoo_: or top 5% if that's too much pepeLaugh
[1:01:32] Artiiz: And you had legendaries that helped in some challenges
[1:01:36] ClutchMedic: @PneumaWHU it drives interest, the time crunch to get things done increases time spent ingame to make those goals attainable
[1:01:39] Collnaris: ye tank challenge mode isn't as hard anymore
[1:01:44] TheresNoneLeft: O.O
[1:01:51] skibbatv: that was amazing content
[1:01:54] Alastor7783: I wasn't here, but that sounds 100% like something you'd do LULW
[1:01:56] Mirkooo: peepoHey Annie and chat rar
[1:01:57] Lorrdzik: I couldnt do healer one but I did try to do it too late
[1:02:07] Geoffku: MEOWDY @Mirkooo

[1:02:12] Mirkooo: @Wardrick7 @Geoffku MEOWDY

[1:02:42] skibbatv: anniesDude
[1:02:43] Alastor7783: anniesDude
[1:02:43] PneumaWHU: @ClutchMedic But not removing keeps interest. How many people would still run Tempest Keep if Ashes stopped dropping after TBC?
[1:02:48] Collnaris: @Artiiz yep, i feel that with druid forms
[1:02:53] Celc1us: just simple peasants
[1:02:58] Aegis_2566: I'm still proud that i got the tank challenge when it was nearly impossible, later it got tuned and nerfed 4x for blood dk
[1:03:14] skibbatv: @Aegis_2566 play a real class peepoSmile
[1:03:20] Morgonbladet: Because you got the lego needed
[1:03:23] Lorrdzik: I think as a healr you still needed to be decent to beat MT
[1:03:28] Collnaris: OMEGALUL
[1:03:29] Taylor131313: anniesDude
[1:03:30] Lorrdzik: or Im just that bad as healr LUL
[1:03:31] Ata5ll: We have hello fresh here but clicking the link only seems to have me able to select in the US as soon I click go to Belgium its RIP ;D
[1:03:33] Taylor131313: KEKW
[1:03:34] Mirkooo: xdd
[1:03:36] Morgonbladet: That slow ring was useless except for doing tower
[1:03:38] bYTEfROG: anniesDude just loot it
[1:03:40] Azureynn: anniesDude angy
[1:03:42] Artiiz: I remember you used to be able to just nuke warlock affli challenge with the ring that slowed by 60%
[1:03:43] Ms7Mido: anniesDude
[1:03:48] Taylor131313: @Morgonbladet incorrect, was very good for keys
[1:03:49] skibbatv: @Morgonbladet corruption slow I remember LULW
[1:03:56] LuckyStrikerBE: Is there a fellow belgian here ^^
[1:03:59] ClutchMedic: @PneumaWHU well the difference is thats farmable content, how many people would run tempest keep if ashes was 100% drop rate ? it was limited time bc it was guarenteed
[1:04:01] Ata5ll: Not your fault mrs Annie
[1:04:02] Ms7Mido: anniesDude doesnt want it
[1:04:04] Lorrdzik: anniesDude
[1:04:05] Taylor131313: INSANECAT and over and over

[1:04:21] Geoffku: she just cursed herself PepeLaugh
[1:04:24] Marovia: member when you did a wowhead show

[1:05:55] ClutchMedic: @PneumaWHU i mean in all fairness, i have not gotten any of the mage tower weapon appearances, and whilst i wanted them i am content with the fact that i slacked and missed out forever

[1:09:57] Mirkooo: Your pizza taste is controversial
[1:10:00] kashynia: not worth being controversial
[1:10:01] Taylor131313: Annie only has very strong opinions about forsen
[1:10:03] Wardrick7: you are controversial by saying swedish food is good
[1:10:04] deathbybubbles49: @Artiiz true
[1:10:04] Nexusshade: @AnnieFuchsia you're swedish ofc you don't have strong opinions xD
[1:10:05] Collnaris: fence sitter fuchsia Kappa
[1:10:15] Ata5ll: The thing with Asmon is that he's bold, and right.. cos people are bold lol
[1:10:19] Marovia: do we need to remind yout he cow incident
[1:10:19] Taylor131313: oh right, she has very controversial opinion about pizza
[1:10:26] ScrewOnTheLoose: Don't you dare have an opinion that is a little different from the mainstream! It will start a witch hunt with pitchforks and torches.
[1:10:28] Collnaris: you have strong opinions on collection
[1:10:34] Celc1us: uncultured swine rarely have opinions anyway anniesP
[1:10:47] Max_Winters_: you have strong opinions on meatballs

[1:10:51] Geoffku: TIL i'm swedish Sverige
[1:10:51] kashynia: I just keep my opinions to myself :P
[1:11:03] Ata5ll: The only opinion I heard from Swe-people is immigration in the last year
[1:11:04] Marovia: would you ever consider doing a DBM voice pack?
[1:11:08] Swiggyswoo_: Me too I never voice my opinions
[1:11:13] TheresNoneLeft: im extremely Danish, and have super strong oppinions
[1:11:15] ScrewOnTheLoose: Us Swedes are quite anti social, compared to the US it's almost ridicilous.
[1:11:20] Swiggyswoo_: Kappa
[1:11:21] Taylor131313: I remember when Salbre wanted to do one years ago xdd

[1:12:22] Celc1us: unless its twitch, ill say all kinds of shit on here KEKW
[1:12:27] Mahavilo: NA LUL
[1:12:30] jacksplatt: Swedes are NPCs in their own life?
[1:12:31] Taylor131313: Mirko is that true
[1:12:31] Mirkooo: Germans are very direct yes LUL
[1:12:39] Atomblade: yes
[1:12:46] Taylor131313: americans take all the space because they're fat too
[1:12:46] backstreetalright: everything in life has limits and deserves balance
[1:12:48] Alastor7783: they take all the space cuz they're fat
[1:12:48] Mirkooo: @Taylor131313 You see some people running around with cowboy hats so yes
[1:12:49] Alastor7783: LULW
[1:12:51] Azureynn: there are very few things i like about US culture as a swede but how they are socially is something i've always envied
[1:12:53] Saint_Valravn: my swedish friend said swedish kids are very annoying and then they grow up to be timid to make up for that
[1:12:55] Ata5ll: I don't think Germans and Americans are relatable lol
[1:12:56] Taylor131313: Forsen
[1:12:59] Hasan_Lurker: Forsen
[1:13:00] Wardrick7: Forsen
[1:13:03] Malkyr: The only Swedish streamers I watch are you and Ela
[1:13:04] Geoffku: Forsen
[1:13:07] Aegis_2566: We are direct and also have proper weapon laws peepoOkay
[1:13:08] Collnaris: where i live in midwest, a lot of the people where i live keep to ourselves LUL
[1:13:10] Sprinklerz: Kesha is not very outgoing tbh
[1:13:12] bun419: Im American and also nonconfrontational
[1:13:15] zakazuuluu: hmmm mizkif
[1:13:19] geraltofdothan: ...when I was in Sweden... people didn't realize I was American, until I crossed the street with the walking sign still red.
[1:13:19] Elembry_us: I watch a Dutch streamer. She's pretty quiet.
[1:13:21] Taylor131313: forsen is relatable because he's an antisocial hobo like most of twitch chat
[1:13:22] Mirkooo: @Aegis_2566 true
[1:13:26] Aegis_2566: Kesha is swedish xqc
[1:13:29] Wardrick7: Asmongold is very outgoing Kapp
[1:13:43] Ata5ll: Yeah, it's sad how divided Europe is but with all the languages (past generations hardly talk English)
[1:13:52] Ginji_____: @Wardrick7 asmongold goes out to wendys
[1:13:56] jacksplatt: Its weird, I don't follow any American Streamers. I follows Swedes and Germans and other Euro peoples
[1:13:58] Mirkooo: For sure
[1:13:58] Taylor131313: ALWAYS GO BIG DICK
[1:14:00] Nightbot: @zombienerfkid -> <ᴍᴇssᴀɢᴇ ᴅᴏɴɢᴇʀᴇᴅ> [Purge] [warning]
[1:14:00] geraltofdothan: He's an extrovert in his communucation.
[1:14:03] Wardrick7: YEP he is
[1:14:10] ScrewOnTheLoose: I try to stay as anonymous as possible due to Sweden being Sweden. Looking odd (like I do) and acting differently (like I do), Swedes are going to talk and point fingers...
[1:14:16] jokuTM: FirstTimeChatter
[1:14:19] Marovia: Asmon right opinion wrong way of communicating
[1:14:19] ScrewOnTheLoose: And it's a small country we live in.
[1:14:23] Taylor131313: FirstTimeChadder Crungo
[1:14:25] twitch4home007: he also doesn’t care at all
[1:14:33] Collnaris: linking own twitch channel DIESOFCRINGE
[1:14:45] Azureynn: so true
[1:14:46] elactix2gg: Didnt know u have lazy eye :P LUL
[1:14:46] geraltofdothan: Very reserved was my experience.
[1:14:47] ScrewOnTheLoose: Perhaps it's a fear of mine, lol.
[1:14:56] Aegis_2566: KeshaEUW is the swedish version of xqc, but with on alot of cocaine

[1:15:04] zakazuuluu: you just learned that you are not alone on this planet a bit more ;p
[1:15:04] Ata5ll: That's sad, imo Sweden is the only one who can stick out
[1:15:06] NoName6834: asmon definitely cares
[1:15:06] Geoffku: huh
[1:15:10] Wardrick7: what
[1:15:10] twitch4home007: huh
[1:15:12] backstreetalright: most introverts have tricks to blend in and most of the times they camoflage in
[1:15:12] geraltofdothan: Great coffee shops though, least when I visited Stockholm.
[1:15:12] Taylor131313: now that's a FirstTimeChatter
[1:15:12] Mirkooo: wat
[1:15:13] Azureynn: FirstTimeChatter
[1:15:13] Ginji_____: nice
[1:15:21] icyplums: @elactix2gg odd comment dude
[1:15:23] Mahavilo: world would be so much better like 80's where ppl got raised by ''keep things to your own and dont talk if u know shit'' LUL
[1:15:23] Collnaris: that's a cringe comment LULE
[1:15:23] Ginji_____: KEKW
[1:15:27] Akvahenrik: Swedes are generally javlan danBrows danClueless
[1:15:31] Artiiz: what does that even mean lol
[1:15:40] Ata5ll: Sweden is the best imo
[1:15:41] Taylor131313: yeah sure KEKW
[1:15:42] Saint_Valravn: GOOD
[1:15:43] Celc1us: in the US yes
[1:15:44] Taylor131313: that'll never happen
[1:15:45] Ata5ll: they have Scania!
[1:15:46] F_Word_In_Distress: hello Annie ane chat anniesH2
[1:15:47] Collnaris: that was in florida
[1:15:49] Milsanii: @ScrewOnTheLoose I kinda disagaree all the times I've been to sweden have been amazing and I look ODD for sweden (gothstyle), no one looks weird at me or calls my names like here where I live lol
[1:15:55] ChrismatiQ: Swedes stick to themselves and invents among the greatest things in the world Pog
[1:15:55] RalphMullin: I think that was Florida only
[1:15:58] Mirkooo: ICANT
[1:15:58] twitch4home007: its because they don’t want kids knowing about lgbt or issues
[1:15:59] Elembry_us: Please let that be true
[1:15:59] ScrewOnTheLoose: I find that positive, honestly.
[1:16:00] Collnaris: that was florida law
[1:16:01] Marovia: do you cat knows Sweedish or English????
[1:16:02] LatroTLI: go to the libary
[1:16:06] Sasco1st: lol
[1:16:06] Celc1us: smol minded bongoheads
[1:16:09] geraltofdothan: That was one thing that I noticed is that most Eastern Europeans do keep to themselves, as compared to Americans (like myself) and Canadians.
[1:16:10] clanmonroe: play sports?
[1:16:11] Aegis_2566: https://youtube.com/shorts/VRY_WHFf66A?si=_HBkQywCuAnS8EkM peepoOkay
[1:16:12] Saint_Valravn: the same thing every generation did before social media
[1:16:13] bozzzna: thats how social media is used by kids im sure
[1:16:14] Akvahenrik: Brah danGross
[1:16:16] kashynia: kids need lego
[1:16:20] RalphMullin: Social Media is the last place you should go for news
[1:16:20] Mikkikiki16: Finnish are also like Swedish people.
[1:16:20] Malkyr: Kids proabbly dont want to know
[1:16:24] NoName6834: still needs to pass the state senate
[1:16:31] know_your_onions: social media just messes with their head
[1:16:32] Azureynn: tbh, you need to focus on improving  parenting and fixing structural issues, not such strict laws and policies
[1:16:33] Marovia: Parent needs social media to parent their kids
[1:16:36] Centriuzz: And if they did, they should look somewhere else instead
[1:16:38] Atomblade: social media is mostly brainwash not good for kids
[1:16:39] twitch4home007: boomers on facebook?!
[1:16:40] Taylor131313: outside NoThanks friends NoThanks
[1:16:40] Mirkooo: Kids can go outside? NOWAYING
[1:16:41] geraltofdothan: @Mikkikiki16 I agree!  Lived in Tuusula for a while and visited Sweden often.
[1:16:41] Sasco1st: or read ...
[1:16:44] Malkyr: Play RPGs alone in their room
[1:16:45] itsdergie: kids going outside KEKW
[1:16:45] Elembry_us: Kids need to go be kids not sit on their phones.
[1:16:47] darthenergy: I stopped watching the news, and my mental has been better tbh
[1:16:48] craborac: meeting other people D:
[1:16:48] RyinoGames: im surprised we made past the 90's
[1:16:58] Sasco1st: crazy talk I know :)
[1:17:01] Celc1us: TV? HUH
[1:17:02] Marovia: Parent need the social media to keep their kids busy
[1:17:04] Ata5ll: If they need Social media then their life is ruined. Like all those kids on TikTok... ruined
[1:17:10] Collnaris: that was a florida law that was proposed
[1:17:11] jokuTM: Kids are totally fine with chatting. And even that needs some limits.
[1:17:12] Saint_Valravn: I mean they'd still have access to news sites even if they're very interested in news
[1:17:14] Bloodmatch: Tik tokkers need their fix
[1:17:15] Aegis_2566: I hope my 6 year old niece wont cancel me
[1:17:16] dasqoot: weirdPaper make them read the newspaper
[1:17:18] TiwazFo5: yes it is
[1:17:19] jacksplatt: im glad we don't have strong opinions
[1:17:21] ScrewOnTheLoose: @Milsanii I understand what you're saying, but it's not just my style/makeup, I have an inconvenient face and body that gets attention that I don't want. I feel like a walking freakshow.
[1:17:22] Celc1us: they look at boobs for sure
[1:17:23] twitch4home007: tiktok hot chip
[1:17:25] bjork542: Is annie your birthname? Haven’t heard a swede be called that
[1:17:29] Collnaris: or minecrafters
[1:17:30] TiwazFo5: social media is 100% being used to sway the minds of youth
[1:17:31] Taylor131313: @Celc1us YEP
[1:17:37] Marovia: do your cat knows sweedish or english??
[1:17:41] Akvahenrik: Or watching Annie rn Kappa
[1:17:41] geraltofdothan: Heck, I remember when Facebook required a university email and could only have friends at that university.
[1:17:43] Elembry_us: Annnnnd that's why we had kids eating tide pods
[1:17:52] RalphMullin: Honestly, Keep kids away from the internet all together. I'm tired of sites tiptoeing around because a kid might see something they shouldn't
[1:17:59] twitch4home007: but twitch is social media?!
[1:18:02] Celc1us: I watch hockey fights on TikTok thats about it KEKW
[1:18:06] geraltofdothan: ...but that was in 2004... oldage...
[1:18:07] Collnaris: people who get all their opinions from social media Pepega
[1:18:08] Morgonbladet: Asmon was talking about it
[1:18:20] NoName6834: did the fridge turn on?
[1:18:23] darthenergy: @twitch4home007 Look here you little shhhii
[1:18:25] icyplums: @twitch4home007 16 or under shouldn't be on Twitch anyway
[1:18:28] Ata5ll: Now days, all media is bad. War here war there, mocking here, bulllying there
[1:18:37] Geoffku: @NoName6834 was wondering if that were fridge noises LULW
[1:18:43] Milsanii: @ScrewOnTheLoose I get that but I'm also morbidly obese with red hair and goth style and piercings, when I go outside here where I live I get yelled at to cut myself and emo with every disease in the world added, if its not about me being fat in the firstplace :P
[1:18:44] ScrewOnTheLoose: @Ata5ll This!
[1:18:58] Atomblade: i use only X for news on twitch  or gaming stuff and thats it! rest is gooonnee
[1:19:01] geraltofdothan: I don't know if I'd consider the purpose of Twitch as social media... more like a gaming streaming platform... though it's grown from that into other platforms.
[1:19:10] icyplums: queue the copying asmond comments lul
[1:19:13] RalphMullin: @icyplums I agree with Asmon, keep kids away from real humans
[1:19:19] Ata5ll: LOL
[1:19:31] Collnaris: it was proposed
[1:19:37] Collnaris: not passed
[1:19:37] Taylor131313: florida man stuff CLASSIC
[1:19:44] Celc1us: Swamp Country?
[1:19:46] geraltofdothan: ...I'm 30 minutes from Florida...
[1:19:51] Atomblade: @AnnieFuchsia  when do you put the sword on the wall behind you?
[1:19:51] Elembry_us: Please let that go federal
[1:19:52] Lorcanlight: Some kids their only connection to friends and families is social media
[1:19:59] Geoffku: monkaS
[1:20:03] Marovia: true
[1:20:14] Collnaris: HUH
[1:20:24] icyplums: should be worldwide, kids under 16 do not need social media. it's so damaging. I know a kid who is 14 and she is being bullied in school and it happens outside of school on whatsapp etc, it's awful.
[1:20:25] Taylor131313: HUH
[1:20:34] Mahavilo: what a guy LUL
[1:20:36] Ata5ll: another one of those sick things in the media every so many days... disgusting
[1:20:40] toddz1518: Fyfan
[1:20:42] NoName6834: anniesYikes
[1:20:45] ScrewOnTheLoose: @Milsanii Yikes... I'm so sorry you have to go through that. I'm morbidly obese myself with a six-head and my fat distribution (spelling?) is... odd. But you definitely DO NOT deserve having to take that crap, you be you!
[1:20:50] Azureynn: it doesn't remotely address the issue, stricter policies rarely if ever work, you need to address underlying problems
[1:20:52] Taylor131313: HUHH
[1:20:53] Collnaris: MarioZelda007
[1:20:54] Mahavilo: there is sooooo many of those kind of men HOLY
[1:20:55] Malkyr: That isnt a social media thing though, that could happen in real life too
[1:21:07] Akvahenrik: America rofl
[1:21:12] RalphMullin: Although I agree that kids need to stay away from social media, there's no way this law is going to pass
[1:21:24] bYTEfROG: SKIBBAA
[1:21:25] spexor: @Malkyr red flag for you xd
[1:21:25] icyplums: a lot less likely in person
[1:21:26] ScrewOnTheLoose: IIRC, in Sweden the legal limit is 15 years old, if that hasn't changed? It's creepy as heck, honestly.
[1:21:26] Taylor131313: YEP the guy Collnaris timed out needs a sailorban
[1:21:27] Ata5ll: In public it's less.. cos it's not hidden!
[1:21:48] jayzororck: PridePog
[1:21:48] jokuTM: You do that IRL you get in trouble right away.
[1:21:50] Mirkooo: For sure
[1:21:51] icyplums: dude just put out a red flag for themselves lol
[1:21:57] Milsanii: @ScrewOnTheLoose that's what I'm trying to do and live be, however I can understand if you don't know worse Sweden can still be bad, but for me, everytime I'm in Sweden it's like a breath of relief for me, I'm really hoping to emigrate to Sweden in a few years even, it's my dream
[1:21:57] Mikkikiki16: Maybe some men may meet some girl and rape them.
[1:21:59] Malkyr: I more meant teachers and gym coaches and such. I hadnt thought of the catfishing side of it though
[1:22:04] Marovia: he also has easier reach, is not him walking to one, is him walking to hundreds
[1:22:04] Taylor131313: SKIBBAA
[1:22:17] Celc1us: you mean grooming, I listen a lot to P3 Dokumentär, theres so many cases like this that theyve covered its sad Sadge
[1:22:26] Collnaris: kids are very vulnerable on social media
[1:22:31] Geoffku: ye
[1:22:32] notohkae: !drops
[1:22:32] Saint_Valravn: Yup
[1:22:32] Nightbot: Get your latest WoW drop in this stream! Read more here: https://shorturl.at/bFOR5
[1:22:40] clanmonroe: agree
[1:22:41] bYTEfROG: teachers get caught easier, kids just tell their parents
[1:22:42] zakazuuluu: whats that sound? is the AC on in the room?
[1:22:54] Milsanii: same @AnnieFuchsia
[1:22:58] jokuTM: Online its so efficient for one creep to reach a ton of kids
[1:22:59] Celc1us: it may be the monster fridge zakazBooty
[1:22:59] RalphMullin: true
[1:23:01] Collnaris: online, people are anonymous
[1:23:02] darthenergy: I tried looking it up, and all im getting are articles on jefferey epstein and R Kelly
[1:23:03] SyrenLove441365: kids are way too vulnerable and sensitive for social media. does more harm to them than good.
[1:23:12] Ata5ll: This subject makes me depressed thinking about how effed the world is
[1:23:13] bYTEfROG: her pc is preparing for lift-off
[1:23:16] zakazuuluu: ahh, you should check the temps then ;p
[1:23:17] geraltofdothan: Creepy...
[1:23:18] Aegis_2566: Not fixed fan curve?
[1:23:22] twitch4home007: HEY GIRL *winks* @anniefuchsia
[1:23:26] Milsanii: I was groomed when I was 12-13 and SA'd 7 times because of this social media access so I'm very for age limiting it
[1:23:30] Saint_Valravn: Yeah they don't know what's what and can't even imagine something malicious
[1:23:32] dovilacus: Alot of them I don't think even want to meet the kids, they just want to groom them into sending CP which idk if it gets distributed or not, sometimes they blackmail the kids after
[1:23:41] Marovia: and specially if their parents think their kids need the social media to stay informed
[1:23:44] Collnaris: they can be tricked who they are talking to online, the person can pretend to be another child
[1:24:01] Mirkooo: What is SA'd?
[1:24:09] bYTEfROG: sexually assaulted
[1:24:09] Mikkikiki16: I only like women who are over 18.
[1:24:11] darthenergy: assaulted
[1:24:12] Mirkooo: Ah Sadge
[1:24:12] Collnaris: sexual assault
[1:24:15] Bloodmatch: Assault mirkoo
[1:24:18] ScrewOnTheLoose: @Milsanii I have my fingers crossed for you, that you will be able to live permanently in Sweden, if that's what you wish for. I have agoraphobia so I haven't been outside in bigger areas in like... a decade?
[1:24:19] twitch4home007: social media is where all the classroom bullying takes place now also @anniefuchsia
[1:24:21] Ata5ll: I remember when I was 14-15 how much girls had a boyfriend older then 20 whilst being the same age as me
[1:24:22] Jammup: I am 62 year old Gamer. Just enjoy watching Streams of Games I play for insight. I have never DM a Streamer ,  unless they asked me to due to the games we played.
[1:24:27] gunzpewpew: For all the bad things that come with social media I think we just have to accept that it is part of our lives and future ngl
[1:24:48] jacksplatt: wow, yeah, how could you age limit social media? Would Twitch Count as social media?
[1:24:55] Celc1us: bombarded with crap at such a young age
[1:24:56] twitch4home007: yup
[1:25:06] tehpii: ai thing will enable even more pedo behavior tho so world is going to shit
[1:25:08] PneumaWHU: to work with kids in the UK, you need to pass certain checks. on social media, there's nothing like that
[1:25:08] Collnaris: yep
[1:25:09] Wardrick7: yes, that was/is a problem
[1:25:12] Marovia: totally was a topic with fb friends
[1:25:14] icyplums: I know a 14 yo girl who is being bullied by her class mates on social media. the school say they can't do anything about it. it's awful.
[1:25:15] jacksplatt: i do yearly purge of my facebook friends
[1:25:18] Ata5ll: NEW SUBJECT: Pinapples!
[1:25:22] clanmonroe: agree
[1:25:32] Saint_Valravn: I'm kind of curious how they will check for it
[1:25:38] Mirkooo: Social media is a poison for kids, i'm glad i had atleast 12-13 years of normal childhood before everyone used it anniesSole
[1:25:40] Wardrick7: limiting social media for kids is good but how would you do it? age limitations dont really work for other things
[1:25:40] twitch4home007: my kids school had a social media policy and if you do that shit you get suspended
[1:26:00] Collnaris: the schools have more jurisdiction in schools, not outside of the property
[1:26:00] ScrewOnTheLoose: I think it would be good to limit social media for younger people. Because the amount of likes, comments, followers etc is almost like... your worth. That's scary.
[1:26:08] Taylor131313: I got social media at 19 BBoomer
[1:26:09] Celc1us: they cant force id checks thats for sure
[1:26:11] Azureynn: these issues appearing more frequently in the age of social media isn't caused by social media but we see the symtoms of larger societal issues through social media -   failing to address those will mean that stricter policies achieve nothing
[1:26:25] eternitycrystal: the parents should regulate the children's social media access. It's not societies job to fix this.
[1:26:30] haxez_org: to hard to put the genie back in the bottle. you wont be able to take it away from those who already have it. Unless strict ID verification takes place people will just fake their age
[1:26:30] clanmonroe: parents need to pay attention too
[1:26:36] rpl_1337: this happened to my daughter when she was 13. we turned it over to local police and they basically blew us off.
[1:26:38] Ata5ll: Well, it will only get worse.. We're getting older and will never be able to grasp the youth
[1:26:48] Marovia: also kids dont know a world WITHOUT social media, we do
[1:26:53] zakazuuluu: kids are way too much impressionable, if that gets cut, a lot of influencers will earn lot less money, because adds will not be that effective. Welcome capitalism ;p
[1:26:55] Malkyr: Yeah a lot of these issues predate social media was what I was thinking. But yeah it is a lot worse now and I didnt really think about how much worse it is now
[1:26:57] Ata5ll: @rpl_1337 wish that didn't sound familiar
[1:27:17] Akvahenrik: They want people to get more healthy and even socialise. Yet you can do so much sitting behind a screen
[1:27:18] ScrewOnTheLoose: This is why I have chosen to not have kids, among other reasons.
[1:27:18] rpl_1337: nasty pics form older men
[1:27:45] Collnaris: @ScrewOnTheLoose i was gonna say username too Kappa
[1:27:46] Ata5ll: Parents can't handle their kids crying fora toy
[1:27:46] Jammup: 16 Year old and below shouldnt have access to social media outlets imo. None would have it and it wouldnt be a thing until they get more to an adult age.
[1:27:57] bYTEfROG: even if there are underlying societal problems: social media certainly exacerbates them
[1:28:01] gunzpewpew: Having an age limit also helps parents and businesses to say no
[1:28:09] ScrewOnTheLoose: @Collnaris Yep, there is something behind that.
[1:28:09] Milsanii: @ScrewOnTheLoose same, one of the many reasons
[1:28:11] eternitycrystal: @Ata5ll then you shouldn't have kids?
[1:28:28] Ata5ll: I agree but now you
[1:28:30] Wardrick7: it helps, but for example age limits on games. no one cares about that and kids play whatever they want
[1:28:38] Celc1us: soon enough youll need a license to even have children
[1:29:04] Milsanii: @rpl_1337 I feel you, my case is still on a huge pile of CP cases even though I have a whole bible of proof, dude is still out there
[1:29:13] Marovia: is not like a 15 year old is a saint, we all here did illegal stuff at that age, even a beer!
[1:29:15] Matt07k: I also heard about different side of it. Few years back when FaceBook was a thing my grandpa had a picture with his granddaughter. Random people were writing mean comments and calling him names. And you could see their names, maybe fake but still fucked up.
[1:29:16] gunzpewpew: I hope chat never have kids
[1:29:21] Saint_Valravn: peer pressure especially among children is huge
[1:29:24] parwxd: @Wardrick7 i believe it still has some effect, a parent will be much less likely to buy like that for their kids
[1:29:26] Wardrick7: against the law also makes it a "cool" thing to do as a teenager
[1:29:31] Collnaris: some parents are strict on that
[1:29:33] Ata5ll: I firmly believe a kid learns more when you don't give everything it wants but that's just me
[1:29:41] icyplums: I was never allowed to play games over my age!
[1:29:47] Atomblade: @AnnieFuchsia  instagram has a family option to protect the kid XD i just checked it ..
[1:29:47] Celc1us: my parents never bought me games, had to save up all by myself SeemsGood
[1:29:50] NoName6834: D:
[1:29:52] Aegis_2566: My dad bought me gta 3 when i was 8 or 9 omE
[1:29:56] zakazuuluu: like 10 years ago this wasn't even a thing, parents are catching up but it's all quite sudden the whole digital era
[1:29:56] Taylor131313: at 13 WutFace
[1:29:58] Annies_Bot: Check out Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth here: https://bit.ly/infinitewealth_anniefuchsia Out today!
[1:30:00] Collnaris: ye same, until they got kicked out of school LUL
[1:30:01] rel_hunyad: i dont wanna be that guy , but sometimes the kids no matter what the parents do will still be against the parents and do whatever they want
[1:30:02] Wardrick7: my parents cared, but every of my friends did not care and played games i could not LUL
[1:30:09] eternitycrystal: yea the big chunk will be stopped trying it when there is a script age law
[1:30:18] Akvahenrik: Do children even play with each other anymore, or do they use their phone all day danStare
[1:30:21] Nox4rcana: In my opinion, rather than limiting, people should be taught how to use it. Because when you limit something it will become enticing, people become curious about limited things. And someone gets curious enough they will break that limitation since you can't watch someone 24/7
[1:30:26] Grillyo: ~60% of my class was party drinking between 13-14 lmao, to be fair the remaining 40% almost don't drink at all.
[1:31:01] Shannieann: All parents should have basic parental controls on their kids devises tbh. Have you seen the creepy stuff on youtube kids?
[1:31:04] renegadewolf: it takes a village to raise a child. unfortunately today parents are scared of all these social predators and tend to try and shield their child from everything. Good and bad.
[1:31:07] Aegis_2566: Peer pressure for many children
[1:31:17] ScrewOnTheLoose: A lot of times I WANT to put my phone away for a day or two, but I can't because of obligations to be available. Very stressful and frustrating.
[1:31:19] epicpockettroll: i guess the only thing is that my parents forbade me to do soccer at local club, afterwards im kinda happy they didnt, hearing about the alcolism and drugs go on in there
[1:31:28] CDiables: it is just like social smoking. if there are restrictions, we will limit the amount of kids with social media
[1:31:30] LadyKawa: LadyKawa subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:31:31] Annies_Bot: LadyKawa has subscribed for 3 months! Welcome DIAMOND! anniesL anniesPrime
[1:31:31] Annies_Bot: anniesPrime anniesPrime anniesPrime
[1:31:47] RalphMullin: Would WoW/Diablo be considered Social Media cuz of guilds and chats... If so, this is a win in my book, keep them kids away from my game
[1:31:52] LatroTLI: never bothered with social media, stuck to age ratings of games and movies, was definitely the right decision, I grew up not letting peoples opinions get to you and be happy just being yourself
[1:31:56] catstar88: HeyGuys
[1:32:00] Ata5ll: @Akvahenrik I knew someone and they had a kid of 8 years old and she played with other children... but she als okept nagging for a phone to check out tiktok, and once she got it she learned the most disgusting sexual things ever.. it's gross
[1:32:03] Wardrick7: i do agree with my parents limiting some games for me but i also think they were a bit too strict LUL overall i think parents should limit 18+ games like GTA for kids
[1:32:13] rel_hunyad: i was born in 2001 , i had my first phone ( without touch-screen) when i i reached the age of 14 and always got made fun of cause i dont have social media or things like but honestly didnt care , it hurt but i didnt care
[1:32:20] wesjer250: i never cared for laws as a kid
[1:32:29] Collnaris: the law does make it more serious. how they will enact that, idk
[1:32:44] ScrewOnTheLoose: Btw, Annie, I apprecaite you having this discussion - it's very important and I think you have a healthy mindset and thoughts.
[1:32:58] Azureynn: the problem with that is 1) politicans using these stricter policies as a end-all solution because addressing the structural issues takes a lot more work 2) ignoring the actual benefits of (social media) 3) the fact that it is incredibly difficult to regulate something like the internet and internet usage unless you go authoritarian like China
[1:33:00] Calvagh: NODDERS
[1:33:00] Nightbot: NODDERS
[1:33:03] twitch4home007: remember when you had to memorize your friends home phone numbers?
[1:33:04] Malkyr: Just becuase something isnt a perfect solution doesnt mean you shouldnt at least try solutions
[1:33:12] Ata5ll: I grew up with guys and their mother were like: If I say no, they do it behind my back. So when we were 12 they started smoking, and at 14 they were doing drugs
[1:33:17] kashynia: protect the younglings from the predators
[1:33:18] Collnaris: hopefully cut down at least
[1:33:33] Wardrick7: i dont think a law against social media will make it worse so why not try it
[1:33:36] ivans201403: hi
[1:33:45] Shannieann: social media really does need more oversight, it is one of the key sources of radicalisation.
[1:33:46] Collnaris: that's kinda shit
[1:33:49] Ata5ll: Yeah, crazy stuff
[1:33:55] CDiables: would hurt internet traffic so companies would prolly be against it
[1:33:56] twitch4home007: lol thats just not parenting at all
[1:34:00] gunzpewpew: When I was a kid, we had parental restrictions on the internet and social media and phones and stuff. There's no point of having access to this stuff before youre at least 13
[1:34:04] twitch4home007: nihilism
[1:34:15] harpdarp: Kids drink and do drugs - because it is forbidden and viewed as cool for kids
[1:34:18] Ata5ll: true dat
[1:34:29] twitch4home007: annie spitting some truth out on a lazy sat morning
[1:34:31] ivans201403: anniesYay1
[1:34:32] Nightbot: anniesYay1 anniesYay2 anniesYay3
[1:34:38] thewiszard69: kz, esti tigan?

[1:34:47] Filippoh94: anniesH_TK
[1:34:50] kzboy2: Are we not all??
[1:34:54] Cabie_: peer pressure and influence from other kids does exist too
[1:34:56] thewiszard69: <3
[1:34:58] twitch4home007: ehhhh
[1:34:59] Collnaris: the person who wants to break the rules, will always break the rules LUL
[1:35:02] Ata5ll: This conversation makes me feel such a dweep, I always listened to my mother lol
[1:35:05] Taylor131313: true
[1:35:15] know_your_onions: that argument applies to every law, no matter the law people still break it so why bother having laws LUL
[1:35:34] Shannieann: Parents also just need to be more involved too.
[1:35:42] Foyth: I... agree
[1:35:43] askriz1: the more hurdles, then people will buy things illegally, opening themselves to bad actors and low quality product
[1:35:44] rel_hunyad: @Ata5ll dont say that , i also followed every word my parents sayed and im happy i did that , now i dont smoke , dont drink and respect others and the law
[1:35:54] harpdarp: More government regulations = bigger mess - they do not care or are incompetent
[1:36:09] Shannieann: The amount of parents where they do hardly anything here in the uk outside of the bare minimum is horrible.
[1:36:17] Akvahenrik: Starting drinking at the age of 12 is just danUpset
[1:36:18] kashynia: somtimes they are too controlling
[1:36:29] Collnaris: ye that's so dumb
[1:36:31] MetalManGG: peepoHey Annie, chat
[1:36:39] Collnaris: i got in so much trouble for bad grades KEKW
[1:36:39] bYTEfROG: @MetalManGG anniesHEY
[1:36:40] Taylor131313: if I got a bad grade I'd be yelled at for the entire day LULE
[1:36:42] Wardrick7: yea i hate those parents
[1:36:43] Calvagh: its so dumb
[1:36:46] Shannieann: Yeah, here teachers have massive risk of being stabbed by pupils.
[1:36:58] Akvahenrik: Or paying for their kids to graduate
[1:37:02] Mahavilo: @Akvahenrik NA LIFE?
[1:37:04] Taylor131313: LONDON ?
[1:37:04] RalphMullin: Lock kids in their room til they are 18 and then we won't have to worry about anything
[1:37:08] Shannieann: yeah and if they defend themselves they get in trouble
[1:37:08] Titley07: Unfortunately you can't legislate for shitty parents
[1:37:25] Wardrick7: when i got bad grades i had to explain to my parents why and they never assumed it was teachers fault LUL
[1:37:25] Atomblade: sometimes teachers also really dumb
[1:37:31] Akvahenrik: @mahavilo in Denmark they start early
[1:37:34] Ata5ll: @rel_hunyad Well for me, I got bullied cos I looked up to those other guys and their friends found me weak cos I didn't wanna join the drugs etc etc etc... afterwards it's easy to say, I should've found myself better friends but at that time I guess they were the cool guys and I was the one getting bullied ;D
[1:37:43] MJ4S: !drop

[1:38:14] Collnaris: when i got bad grades, i'd be grounded, can't play games, can't hang out with friends. it sucked but helped me work harder
[1:38:16] Taylor131313: SKIBBAA
[1:38:16] Aegis_2566: Entitled parents and childs
[1:38:21] Ata5ll: Heeere kitty kitty kitty
[1:38:24] kashynia: dumb
[1:38:29] clanmonroe: it’s the “not my kid” approach
[1:38:29] Foyth: karens
[1:38:30] Shannieann: it's called being a friend rather than a parent
[1:38:33] Mirkooo: My parents always gave me money if i had an A or B Pog But most of the time i had a C xddDespair
[1:38:38] RalphMullin: Lock parents in their room til they are 60 and then we won't have to worry about anything
[1:38:38] rel_hunyad: my parents talked with the teacher only to give me extra work and stuff to do to better my grades
[1:38:39] kashynia: karen for sure
[1:38:45] Akvahenrik: Entitled Annie fs Kappa
[1:38:53] Collnaris: "my kid is not the issue" *karen engaged*
[1:38:57] theodosiosdeka: so this is something i have thought about and its important to understand that in the ages from 10-16 kids learn A LOT something that is really important to consider as a training situation and not a hey its a kid let it have fun
[1:39:01] JangoMigo: prwetty cattt
[1:39:02] ChunkeyNinja: ALOO @AnnieFuchsia seems I came into a serious topic
[1:39:03] Ata5ll: Sorry but I find it stupid that a name is being referred to a personality
[1:39:05] terence0_0: meow
[1:39:06] Wardrick7: even if the teacher is bad as a kid you need to learn to deal with it and not just get parents to yell at teachers LUL
[1:39:33] JangoMigo: the brain
[1:39:37] Jkfaked: Kids learn from age 0
[1:39:43] rel_hunyad: that can be taken so out of context 4Weird
[1:39:57] Mikkikiki16: If I would have children i would let them do what they want because they are going to do it anyways.
[1:39:58] Ata5ll: Tickle her nose haha
[1:40:03] theodosiosdeka: drug testing and giving teenagers lessons on performance and psychological analysis like after school u go have a pee test then u go and talk to a proffesional about whatever happend
[1:40:06] eternitycrystal: the discipline need to be learned at a very young age so the puberty goes a bit controlled.
[1:40:10] Collnaris: monkaW
[1:40:11] Taylor131313: weapons monkaW
[1:40:12] Mirkooo: Weapons monkaW

[1:41:21] Mirkooo: rar
[1:41:27] Collnaris: probably in jail, so he can have a cell to himself Kappa
[1:41:31] Delury94: my daugther got a tablet in first class ... from school they mean they need it ...
[1:41:38] Taylor131313: that's the path to becoming a psychopath, unironically
[1:41:39] JangoMigo: your cat is like simba rom lion king
[1:41:41] zakazuuluu: they give their young kids an ipad so the parents get 'free' time ;p
[1:41:46] Ata5ll: You know someone has a good hearth when they care about someone they haven't seen in ages ;D
[1:41:47] Shannieann: kids don't have natural empathy
[1:41:48] Lorcanlight: theres a reason why children social workers exist
[1:41:51] Shannieann: they need to be taught it
[1:41:56] c0mmander_starscream: Sociopath
[1:42:04] ScrewOnTheLoose: I'd be like "BOY BYE" and throw sticks after him. Even though it's wrong. Either way, have to go AFK for a wee bit. Take care you all!
[1:42:14] JangoMigo: i love your cat
[1:42:16] Duke_Concord: is that all of the wow collector editions on the shelf?
[1:42:28] ChunkeyNinja: Kids need to be socialised by like age 4 or something otherwise you know they're gonna be trouble when they're older
[1:42:34] Marovia: your cat speak sweedish?
[1:42:35] Collnaris: do you really need WoD tho.... Kappa
[1:42:48] Ata5ll: I think parents try to protect their kids from reality too much, life is hard and you don't teach your kids that with always giving them their way
[1:42:50] Taylor131313: Sassy
[1:42:53] Collnaris: BrainSlug

[2:50:08] ranger10700: do you use a usb hub?
[2:50:08] KennySpellbound: peepoGiggle
[2:50:09] RalphMullin: Ask Starforge for a PC :)
[2:50:14] Aegis_2566: What are temps saying
[2:50:14] Collnaris: because swedish PepeHands
[2:50:20] Aegis_2566: Any peak temperatures?
[2:50:21] Gtabsc: warlock pact
[2:50:27] Gtabsc: curses everywhere
[2:50:27] Ata5ll: Who could possible curse Annie
[2:50:27] Collnaris: cam hot?
[2:50:34] Gtabsc: in exchange for fire magic :P
[2:50:43] Collnaris: she also only uses 1 pc though
[2:50:46] Collnaris: for streaming and gaming
[2:50:48] Aegis_2566: Cpu temps
[2:50:53] Aegis_2566: You have a 14900k after all
[2:50:58] LuckyStrikerBE: maybe your mobo is dying ?
[2:51:04] ChrismatiQ: Did you change the camera to the other PC?
[2:51:17] Taylor131313: oh no, did you crash again?
[2:51:19] adm_ededwardramsbottom: anniesShy_HF
[2:51:27] Aegis_2566: The solution is to switch to Ryzen guzuNerd
[2:51:28] Ata5ll: Why are you referring to her PC if her cam fails... its either the cam or the drivers then
[2:51:33] Taylor131313: changed camera yet?
[2:51:34] Alastor7783: @Aegis_2566 +1
[2:51:42] Collnaris: maybe cam if it's only thing you haven't changed
[2:51:45] Aegis_2566: @Alastor7783 Imagine you can flex with this https://i.imgur.com/migJoRi.png
[2:51:46] LuckyStrikerBE: keep notes of what you change overtime you will find the faulty product
[2:51:46] Taylor131313: yeah defo try switching camera for tomorrow
[2:51:50] Jesilyn: or it's software issue like icue
[2:51:55] ehrw: usb controllers can also be overloaded. try splitting up "heavy" devices between controllers
[2:52:01] Alastor7783: Threadripper POGGERS
[2:52:07] Aegis_2566: Uhrf pogg
[2:52:07] Taylor131313: I think the camera is the most likely to be the issue
[2:52:08] ranger10700: do you use a usb hub by any chance?
[2:52:09] kashynia: process of elimation
[2:52:09] Jylliee: What headset?
[2:52:13] ChrismatiQ: cus if you move the camera to the other pc and the same thing happens with That pc, you know what the problem is¨'
[2:52:17] Ata5ll: could always check your system logs but not that you'll get much out of it
[2:52:23] Aegis_2566: Ehrw Nordschleife is coming to Forza pogg
[2:52:28] Aegis_2566: Finally
[2:52:28] ehrw: @Aegis_2566 :o
[2:52:31] Alastor7783: didn't you have another camera? try that one for a while Hmmge
[2:52:50] Collnaris: might be worth a try
[2:52:51] Aegis_2566: Cant you export/import? Hmmge
[2:52:55] Taylor131313: oh you don't have it yet
[2:52:59] Ata5ll: What camera are you using?
[2:53:03] ehrw: what's the mobo?
[2:53:07] Taylor131313: thought you already had it
[2:53:09] the_voidhunter: What would happen if Annie got a dragon whelp irl? FrankerZ
[2:53:16] Aegis_2566: A 790
[2:53:19] Aegis_2566: Z790
[2:53:19] ehrw: !originspecs
[2:53:19] Nightbot: NEW PC SPECS: https://i.imgur.com/3lhuhFB.jpeg
[2:53:35] Ata5ll: intel, real sadge :p
[2:53:45] wolfbore: if you have a pcie slot open you can put a usb pcie card in
[2:53:46] Ata5ll: What cam you use ANnie
[2:53:50] ehrw: wanna check the usb controller ports etc :D
[2:54:11] RalphMullin: I've seen this a number of times. A lot of people have had success by adding a separate USB PCIE Card to split up the amount of USB devices.
[2:54:12] Aegis_2566: Annie what about getting a Red V-Raptor XI 8K for your camera?
[2:54:14] kashynia: camera seperate from game sounds good
[2:54:17] WubstahWulf: is your pc loud?
[2:54:17] Taylor131313: is moving overlays over complicated?
[2:54:22] Aegis_2566: 50k Euros is not that expensive for a camera
[2:54:29] kashynia: can OBS export settings>
[2:54:35] TheresNoneLeft: missed a bit my PC pulled nice Blue screen on me :/
[2:54:42] Draindowns: !ui
[2:54:42] Nightbot: Annie sharing her UI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI-pBOqFkQE (String link: https://pastebin.com/mpj4XRhy)
[2:54:53] ranger10700: a problem with a lot of usb hubs is that they provide ports but they don't provide enough power for the ports. but if you have the same issues without the usb hub, might not be the issue
[2:54:59] Aegis_2566: Your stuff is saved in Streamelements isnt it?
[2:55:04] redwrym: i quit buying PC , my mac mini playes wow on 4k
[2:55:07] Aegis_2566: So you should be able to export and then import
[2:55:17] Morgonbladet: @Redwrym based
[2:55:22] kashynia: ouch to mac mini
[2:55:24] eielwind: what are you farming for?
[2:55:24] maiiisan18: seeing some m+ or raid would be sick
[2:55:25] KennySpellbound: Deadge
[2:55:26] RalphMullin: @ranger10700 She has a powered hub so probably not the issue
[2:55:30] Collnaris: monkaS got blasted by trash mob
[2:55:33] Ata5ll: I wouldn't do something so "work intensive" without knowing what the issue really is
[2:55:37] Taylor131313: 4k on 1 setting? xdd
[2:55:38] kashynia: my mac mini cant play twitch
[2:55:48] eielwind: oo ok
[2:56:04] Collnaris: i like mac n' cheese
[2:56:08] Morgonbladet: @Taylor131313 Apparently Mardyke is a mac gamer btw
[2:56:20] Ata5ll: @Collnaris rather Lasagne

[2:56:44] KennySpellbound: eeeh
[2:56:47] Morgonbladet: reconnect keyboard
[2:56:47] Aegis_2566: Maybe your control button is pressed
[2:56:47] kashynia: then can alt tab
[2:56:48] Fazilol: monkaWAT
[2:56:52] RalphMullin: probably the same usb issue
[2:56:57] Collnaris: maybe it's voice activated Kappa
[2:56:58] WubstahWulf: will you be playing the new ff14 expansion?
[2:57:00] adamgoon: does that mean an arrow key is stuck down?
[2:57:03] Collnaris: say "alt tab"
[2:57:04] Efendal: worst thing is when you cant right click your sound options thing in the taskbar
[2:57:15] Aegis_2566: Maybe the crash caused one of your buttons to be stuck
[2:57:33] RalphMullin: I always wanted to take a trip to germany
[2:57:41] Collnaris: @WubstahWulf she will yes! once she finishes endwalker xdd

[3:02:59] eielwind: they made those rares so confusing
[3:03:00] PneumaWHU: it resets when the zone is back up
[3:03:06] PneumaWHU: after being down the day before
[3:03:11] loppish91: im so confused
[3:03:13] loppish91: LUL
[3:03:19] Taylor131313: it got pulled and it's dying, tag it and see what happens
[3:03:48] PneumaWHU: the day karokta is not up, loot it resets the day after
[3:04:01] Aegis_2566: This script now says false for me /run print(C_QuestLog.IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(75334))
[3:04:05] loppish91: nah nothing
[3:04:15] Collnaris: can loot
[3:04:25] jurkns: biweekly is every 2 weeks @AnnieFuchsia
[3:04:26] PneumaWHU: basically
[3:04:37] Collnaris: dreamsurge done
[3:04:42] Taylor131313: no, biweekly is twice every week
[3:04:45] Taylor131313: wait no
[3:04:47] Mordotzz: u can check ATT addon annie, if there's a checkmark you are saved
[3:04:49] Aegis_2566: Didnt hear question
[3:04:52] krutogaming: rare that drop mounts have longer timer so you can only kill then ones a week form what i get
[3:04:53] Fazilol: Did you decide to go funeral garments today since it was wedding garments yday?
[3:04:59] Taylor131313: it still resets twice every week, the word is incorrect yeah
[3:05:21] PneumaWHU: the zones are on a rotation
[3:05:25] PneumaWHU: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRrnjYASgBC_8UD9PKE0AORnigDgQ9K2QJZTXQGifBxUH-YBfafxzVP4RKqtj1JTACbSjju367eSSod/pubhtml
[3:05:29] dunderman1: The zone is split up in 3-4 zones and every zone resets every 3 days
[3:05:34] Mordotzz: zones rotate ye, 1 zone is inactive at a time
[3:06:01] Taylor131313: why does blizzard need to complicate rare spawns too
[3:06:03] eielwind: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRrnjYASgBC_8UD9PKE0AORnigDgQ9K2QJZTXQGifBxUH-YBfafxzVP4RKqtj1JTACbSjju367eSSod/pubhtml
[3:06:04] dunderman1: @PneumaWHU ay my doc EZ
[3:06:08] eielwind: oops someone linked already
[3:06:15] Aegis_2566: "Zone 1 (Caldera) is always active - The other 4 zones follow a counterclockwise rotation for which zone is inactive for the day"
[3:06:21] PneumaWHU: so karokta zone is up for 3 days, can kill any time during that, goes down for a day, lockout resets when it comes up again
[3:06:28] loppish91: if she killed it yday
[3:06:30] iivan321: whats your fav class?
[3:06:35] loppish91: and got loot
[3:06:38] Mordotzz: @PneumaWHU ApuDrip
[3:06:39] Regroot_Gaming: Dieabetes be stairing at you
[3:06:39] dunderman1: To keep it simple check the WQ timers in the zone
[3:06:45] Aegis_2566: @dunderman1 No I made it :)
[3:07:04] dunderman1: when that areas WQs expires its down for 1 day then up the day after
[3:07:13] PneumaWHU: doc says zone 4 is inactive today
[3:07:17] dunderman1: and then its reseted

[3:08:14] PneumaWHU: not as far as i know
[3:08:23] KennySpellbound: KEKLEO
[3:08:26] Taylor131313: good question, why complicate it
[3:08:46] eielwind: i dont know why they cant just do a weekly or daily period
[3:08:56] TheresNoneLeft: blizz complicates everything, like the new garbage legendary axe, and the evoker legendary previously.
[3:09:30] dunderman1: @Taylor131313 to try new stuff, at least it was figured out fairly quick this time around
[3:09:35] skibbatv: There should be no daily or weekly reset mechanics. If the player wants to do ragnaros on mythic 50 times a day they should be able to. Why do we pay a subscription
[3:09:36] dunderman1: tho its still shit
[3:10:03] Collnaris: OMG Cohh got a pug BibleThump my heart https://x.com/CohhCarnage/status/1751261304726110465?s=20

[3:36:07] MrGameface808: @SapTheseCasters ehhh you rly dont have to. sure itll slightly help in beginning but the number next to ur implosion is enough to tell
[3:36:09] skibbatv: does she have to make all of these goggles? that's insane
[3:36:23] dunderman1: @skibbatv yea and from all xpacks aswell

[5:22:43] snaeks: Seems to require over 200 in classic skill yeah.
[5:22:46] otisgreen7: i think you just need to talk to the trainer to pick a spec
[5:22:47] drum2327: always thought gnome and goblin engineering was added in wrath

[5:23:13] Taylor131313: anniesFouge
[5:23:13] Alastor7783: yes
[5:23:16] Collnaris: the french way
[5:23:18] Jegawuffle: "Both of these words are nouns, and they share a common meaning. Ambiance is closer to the word’s origins in French, but ambience is more common in actual use and has been in English longer. "
[5:23:19] Alastor7783: and it's the only way I've heard it
[5:23:24] skibbatv: Frenchgehonhon ban french words

[5:24:03] snaeks: No, none in classic
[5:24:04] zymweth: @skibbatv oui
[5:24:10] Zatcro: To Switch you have to drop your Gob or gnome eng first
[5:24:23] Ata5ll: I guess you can put it like that but Ambiance usually indicates its a positive/fun thing rather then any :p
[5:24:28] snaeks: You need 200 skill in classic engineering to learn gnomish or goblin engi.
[5:24:31] skibbatv: @kazuukw I recommend a demon hunter, the double jump is OP inside instances. And download All The Things addon
[5:24:44] OJ_Hype: yep mage portals were a godsend starting off
[5:24:54] NovaGX4: druid instant flying

[5:26:00] Taylor131313: can you enable and disable ads freely?
[5:26:26] skibbatv: anniesSleeper snooze
[5:26:33] Morgonbladet: I can see upcoming ads and snooze with API, could do some better warnings

[5:26:36] Mongbat25: I saw the snooze say 2/3 a bit ago
