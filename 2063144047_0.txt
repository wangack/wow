[3:48:18] shaayynee: 3rd

[3:53:07] JD_Yadig: eren did nothing wrong
[3:53:11] NPBeharry: no one is randomly naming their character armin lil bro
[3:53:24] NPBeharry: ofc it’s anime reference
[3:53:33] dooshken: @NPBeharry you clearly dont play WoW cause people randomly name their characters all kinda of random shit
[3:53:37] NPBeharry: I don’t even watch anime and I get it
[3:53:42] Kanoonen: Cant he learn dh now? Still time before tournament?

[3:56:59] MaybeRespect: @reeuts Bro my stomach has been fucked up 3 weeks. ER doesn't know why  either
[3:57:05] NPBeharry: venruki made a tier list saying shaman is arguably the best healer right above rdruid for all around pvp, would you agree
[3:57:06] JD_Yadig: time to fistweave LUL
[3:57:19] NPBeharry: 3s, ss, tournament, etc
[3:57:33] kakichoco: why do you sound so sick... still not recovered?
[3:57:44] NPBeharry: yeah basically what he said
[3:57:50] dooshken: rdruid just doesnt have the mana
[3:57:52] JBugaboo: bro what do i do when im getting trained as a resto shaman
[3:58:02] JBugaboo: slt feels like the most dog ass 3 minute in the game
[3:58:13] NPBeharry: right on
[3:58:14] MaybeRespect: Sham utility into casters is nice though.
[3:58:17] MaybeRespect: No?
[3:58:42] Hemmis7: Wasnt the SP more of an issue vs that, rather than the sham?
[3:58:42] caus3_0: Rsham has a lot of utility too
[3:59:23] dooshken: shaman seems harder to play with no coms
[3:59:23] blightclub: I would be interested to see how SL C9 roster MLD would do in this tourney meta
[3:59:30] sicariojones: damn that dude invited you at the perfect time . what a g
[3:59:58] NPBeharry: is sod fun

[4:00:15] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[4:00:16] NPBeharry: everything else was b tier or lower
[4:00:18] blightclub: oh wild
[4:00:35] dooshken: @blightclub wealthyman was on a team for AWC
[4:00:43] ilikegoldfishes: dh lock looks good
[4:00:51] blightclub: @dooshken really I didn't see I guess
[4:00:54] sicariojones: I miss the dew mistweaver
[4:01:25] NPBeharry: yeah everyone playing dh atm
[4:01:41] MaybeRespect: DH is the melee version of lock. High dmg high survival
[4:01:49] Poetree1: Why dont you run DH and rogue
[4:02:03] NPBeharry: I think dh is strongest spec on its own but I think dhs die to rogues
[4:02:10] sicariojones: would DH boomy be any good?
[4:02:12] ilikegoldfishes: does anyone play dh boomy?
[4:02:20] Salty_Spitoonx: @cdewx what do you think blood outlaw rsham would do
[4:02:26] Salty_Spitoonx: for big dam[p
[4:02:26] Hemmis7: Dh rogue vs fistweaver sounds good, stun->eva+blur dead?
[4:02:32] sicariojones: that makes sense
[4:02:40] ADiDough: has sam ever played feral
[4:02:55] dooshken: wasn't wealthyman on power frogs?

[4:03:01] FoxiekittenWoW: Whaazz said that DH just seem alot of deadly than rogues. While rogues do bring more control and slow down the game, you have such a hard time killing anyone while with DH you might not have the same control but you have alot more dmg which they beleive is more important
[4:03:09] NPBeharry: I actually don’t like boomie is like s tier or anything either I think Sam is just completely cracked
[4:03:29] dooshken: boomie seemed really underwhelming in the games versus the move
[4:03:34] dooshken: In the first cup
[4:03:37] NPBeharry: yeah dhs just do infinite damage outside of burst too
[4:04:06] caus3_0: Rdruid would probably be best against fistweaver. Go bear, root and cyclone cleave
[4:04:08] sicariojones: sam just the Boomkin god
[4:04:11] MaybeRespect: Still wild they let DH run wild and nerf DK
[4:04:19] MaybeRespect: We need Mes in there
[4:04:20] Cocoapuffs1: dh having their ms cleave is also pretty crazy
[4:04:23] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @mayberespect is crazy
[4:04:35] NPBeharry: Sam on boomie is kind of like wizk on sp there really aren’t any other players on their level at their spec
[4:04:41] shugguls: dh has gotta get nurfed at some point, it’s so dominant atmo
[4:04:48] iggy_pls: iggy_pls subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 1 year my champ love your shit dawg
[4:05:03] wakener00: take DH's power and give it to RETRIBUTION PALADIN
[4:05:04] Yanzoh: i wish they would buff uh a bit, and totally rework frost to be better
[4:05:14] twin1123: nerf outlaw and buff assas!
[4:05:17] MaybeRespect: Although like, if we nerf DH and rogue, then what melee would be good.

[4:05:31] chimerablaque: have you guys played RLS
[4:05:32] wakener00: those bleeds are so fked
[4:05:34] Esotraz: remove shadow dance from class tree

[4:05:53] Swishinn: i swear we need the mes w dh/warr
[4:05:53] NPBeharry: have you guys been trying any sub rogue comps or nah
[4:05:59] JD_Yadig: preach @esotraz
[4:06:04] ilikegoldfishes: priest heals feel kinda weak imo
[4:06:23] caus3_0: What classes does mes play besides dk?
[4:06:26] MaybeRespect: @Icouldbegood 4?
[4:06:50] NPBeharry: Mes plays dk dh warr ret ele
[4:06:51] JD_Yadig: fury outlaw 🇺🇸
[4:06:57] Yoskexz: does cbrew know kung fu?
[4:07:05] Lionheartleo: try dh outlaw, ques slowed down. good time for practise
[4:07:21] kleanxx: Dh/Boom
[4:07:32] FoxiekittenWoW: you said you watched lontar earlier, did you see they met swapxy playing double shaman, and they both had earthshield up all game? @cdewx
[4:07:40] Blaze150000: Tsg feelt rly good
[4:07:40] caus3_0: Sam should be practicing lock just in case?
[4:08:52] tiltedteepee: when is EU tourney?
[4:09:38] MaybeRespect: You think we get patch b4 tourny?
[4:09:43] MaybeRespect: Or just S4
[4:09:49] dooshken: double shaman pretty gigachad

[4:11:50] jakeo92: aspect of lion stacks with hawk no?
[4:11:51] NPBeharry: top 4 na teams are all cracked
[4:11:56] Zerolol123: how can you say that when the move took 1 awc win and liquid took 1 awc win LUL
[4:12:05] waffleberryx: when i watch u guys u can just tell the amount of experiance u guys have together is o much more than otehr teams
[4:12:12] JBugaboo: because the move got eliminated in tourny 2 lmao
[4:12:15] dooshken: the boys have a lot of competition rn
[4:12:31] NPBeharry: I think liquid are better at adapting than other teams if I had to single something out
[4:12:33] Zerolol123: @JBugaboo they're still 2nd overall
[4:12:37] NPBeharry: a lot of reverse sweeps etc
[4:12:50] dooshken: the move adapted super hard in the first cup
[4:12:57] Icouldbegood: bring back brains team
[4:13:03] Icouldbegood: Kappa
[4:13:17] NPBeharry: I hated Kawhi for so long for dominating every tourney and now I miss them lol
[4:13:37] NPBeharry: I liked them more when they picked up prev tho
[4:13:52] Icouldbegood: they were farming hard
[4:14:12] dooshken: the competition is kinda boring when one team is so dominant like that
[4:14:33] Zerolol123: i still remember when kawhi first started going into qualifiers and facing the move every single qualifier for top 6 LUL
[4:14:41] NPBeharry: yeah I mean they def deserved all the wins they got I was just being a hater
[4:14:49] c9_ruined_ls: !awc
[4:14:56] NPBeharry: yeah that’s why eu is more interesting now that echo isn’t winning every tourney
[4:15:06] NPBeharry: eu was pretty boring last year
[4:15:20] dooshken: I actually pogged irl when Echo lost

[4:15:41] NPBeharry: same @dooshken I agree
[4:15:49] NPBeharry: Chan is one of my fav players too
[4:15:49] MaybeRespect: I feel bad for Lontar. He prob blames himself
[4:16:01] Zerolol123: usually EU is the most damp shit ever just to watch echo win ever since they successfully got their only competition banned from competing
[4:16:06] dooshken: yea Lontar took a lot of unnecessary hate from fanboys
[4:16:08] NPBeharry: lontar is insane he just got thrown into the fire
