[1:56:51] smashwow: @Broomba yeah the jarring experience that is the actual game is going to/ has been a massive turn off to a lot of non-raiders and honestly anyone not pushing top tier content. the only reason they play is for the competition not because of how amazing the game is.

[3:08:43] KaisenSiru: Voldemort!
[3:08:46] Tigerklaue: team rocket
[3:08:46] WorldScrewer: her Plot Armor is too strong
[3:08:47] GTmask: Just like a rogue
[3:08:48] Inishima: thats some bullshit right there...
[3:08:49] filos0phia: it's gonna feel so nice to kill her
[3:08:54] Garrujak: If Sylvanas is not dead/imprisoned after this patch, I'm done
[3:08:55] Draz3nx: what is wrong with tyrande killing that bitch sylvannes
[3:08:55] Kisswani: Tyrande said : " my life for hers " and i'm guessing elune didn't want Tyrande to die @Towelliee
[3:08:56] shimwood: Banshee Dust is her covenant ability
[3:08:57] sphynx_rayne: She is Reaper from OW XD
[3:08:58] wommy: alliance = racist inhabitants of azeroth who hate the horde ofc elune save sylvanas

[3:09:05] Strayer_J: thats what you would do if you had banshee dust lol
[3:09:06] happybooger: i feel that way about the fucking eagles saving the day in LotR
[3:09:09] Densetsu_: Why dont they come up with something to stop her from transforming to that smoke cohhFail
[3:09:09] kokochris: Its because there is a bigger plan; thats why her powers faded
[3:09:10] Muaytitus: the in game cut scene looks so bad i was astounded
[3:09:14] Alepouditsa: you have maintenes and you can't login?
[3:09:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: never underestimate the stupidity of reddit
[3:09:19] madmat93: nah u will defeat her in a raid and she will become your friend again
[3:09:21] othraerir: elune didn't want tyrande to kill her
[3:09:23] cookiemonstersex: Sylvanas is so overused. I hope she just dies, cause there's no ending for her that would be satisfying anymore
[3:09:24] FalconBroadcasting: I want her to sustain an injury in that cutscene, so we can rip it back open during the raid.
[3:09:25] Mitune: I just want to see her hurt at least once
[3:09:28] Stonefather: Or Elune saved Sylvanas danHmm
[3:09:30] Aquadriel: Elune knew ysera was there to defend her
[3:09:36] Krue_Sr: @Stonefather POG
[3:09:39] solsaver12: She did say, " This has to end".
[3:09:39] Darquesoul: or they saved Sylvanas for reasons...
[3:09:40] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee reddit is filled with night elf rpers who are very offended with Blizzard.
[3:09:45] stealthx23: bad storytelling
[3:09:46] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Stonefather ahh, true, that too
[3:09:47] Alienfromger: who whants sylvanas dead? D:
[3:09:52] Hexof: wat ysera would of been wrecked

[3:10:24] oraclespyro: @Towelliee what was the bug with the vault ?
[3:10:26] I_DoctorSatan_I: Maybe there's something Ysera and Elune see's to Sylvanas furture...that's why no one is going to "kill" her off....as of now.
[3:10:27] Draz3nx: I got 220 instead of 226

[3:11:50] CCG_337: that blizz writer has a very hard cruch on sylvanas character
[3:11:51] ic3k0ld: Sylvanas is not whole though right? Her soul is split, so it could make better sense later
[3:11:55] TheKitsuneAdventures: i think elune more pissed off at tyrandia for not protecting her sister

[3:17:18] ArcaneSyntax: wow that guy is full of shit lmao
[3:17:21] filos0phia: it's definitely not a lot of content but I'm not sure what people expected for a x.1 patch
[3:17:26] CritcobainTV: Wait a minute... Are you serious? Are you saying spending 2 hours trying to figure out how to summon one rare isn't the most fun you've ever had?!?
[3:17:38] wommy: bfa definitely > shadowlands
[3:17:38] Buckwink: i miss bfa
[3:17:40] Its_an_implication: lol true
[3:17:44] solsaver12: lol
[3:17:51] jrossino: Genuinely bfa was better
[3:17:53] hooliggan: I quit BFA, I'm enjoying SL more
[3:17:53] Aquadriel: @Towelliee from a casual point of view, BfA was more enjoyable at launch.
[3:17:56] jrossino: Corruptions were sick
[3:17:57] KinggKebab: Shadowlands still started off better than Legion and look how legion turned out
[3:17:58] Eastwicksavag3: this xpac was good .... just took to long for updates ppl get bored
[3:18:01] felblazes: BFA was hella pog compared to SL
[3:18:02] Bigmann109: BFA was fun
[3:18:04] I_DoctorSatan_I: I got the weekly done, Assault, both Torghast wings, and just have one more quest in Korinthia to do....17/20 Chits, gotta grind those last 3
[3:18:04] jrossino: Mounts better in bfa
[3:18:05] solsaver12: I pretty muc quit retail

[3:18:09] solsaver12: much*
[3:18:10] andy_4000: im liking the patch personally but thats me
[3:18:16] Buckwink: if you quit bfa then you dont have a valid opinion on bfa no offense
[3:18:17] Unciatim: SL.... the longest WoW expansion???
[3:18:18] smashwow: @ic3k0ld kinda my point. there's a few dailies, a new raid, a dungeon that is already irrelevant based on gear rewards, and what unlimited grinding or torg? oh boy, butter my biscuit.
[3:18:22] kokochris: @requis_l97 same bro
[3:18:29] Densetsu_: What about the new dungeon? Not open?
[3:18:29] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee in wow new=bad and old=good so its not surprising people like bfa now.
[3:18:29] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:18:29] mavericks312: meh only played bfa for 2 weeks ive played SL the whole release so far
[3:18:36] MizixTV: @KinggKebab yeah but Legion had Illidan hype the whole time
[3:18:42] ThaOriginalGamester: the most engaged i've ever been in WoW was in BFA 8.2 and 8.3
[3:18:44] Aquadriel: darkshore
[3:18:44] Funderik: non
[3:18:44] flebbooo: nothing
[3:18:46] wommy: broken shore?? thjat was good af
[3:18:48] KPable: nothing
[3:18:49] supremedapharaoh: Just waiting to get S2 Glad done
[3:18:49] emixy: This is the first .1 I play since like wrath
[3:18:50] Broomba: i think 9.1 content is left over content from either 9.0 or things scrapped before final release of 9
[3:18:50] nyypsycho: In wrath they added TOC
[3:18:53] mrniceguy817: 9.1 week one followed 9.0 week one same nothing to really do but catch up till week 2
[3:18:53] Aquadriel: Darkshore @Towelliee
[3:18:54] Kisswani: honestly for us returning players not being overwhemed with the new patch is a good thing
[3:18:56] flebbooo: i guese a little in darkshore yeah
[3:18:58] smashwow: yeah usually you get the hub in x.2 not a x.1
[3:19:00] Templexx: they probably combined 9.1/9.2 to make this?
[3:19:01] Cranghoul: new warfront Kappa

[3:19:09] Rottencoarse: nope
[3:19:10] ArcaneSyntax: @wommy broken shore was 7.2
[3:19:11] joshquigley19: @towelliee no
[3:19:11] Grizly922: DARKSHORE WAS 8.1
[3:19:11] ShrenTheOrc: its like mechagon
[3:19:12] Loudriot: I thought mechagon area came 8.1
[3:19:12] HotHotHeals: darkshore felt more like an event
[3:19:12] Funderik: nazj and mecha was 8.2
[3:19:12] felblazes: nope
[3:19:14] ArcaneMaki: Not a single people I know think SL is better than BFA. Not necessarily because of the gamepaly systems, but the whole lore/story is just poorly written.
[3:19:15] sphynx_rayne: @Kisswani this.
[3:19:17] HotHotHeals: you'd go once and never go back
[3:19:18] Aquadriel: warfront darkshore and the darshore quest thub @Towelliee
[3:19:19] epiczplz: azathioprine highlands
[3:19:20] MarquisLek: suramar
[3:19:21] smashwow: which is also lending to the theory we may not go past 9.2
[3:19:22] xCardboardbus: @Towelliee are the Torghast changes live or is that next week also?
[3:19:23] othraerir: heroic warfront?
[3:19:24] upinurguts: Servers still down huh?
[3:19:24] MizixTV: @yobroyobroyo they will probably stop after Wrath
[3:19:26] andy_4000: if your a hardcore player this week is gonna suck
[3:19:26] Shellstars: Island??
[3:19:26] Aquadriel: @Towelliee also incursion on 9.1 (invasion thingies)
[3:19:31] joshquigley19: @towelliee not as a war front
[3:19:32] ic3k0ld: @smashwow yeah, i just come back and play the story do the raid and go play other games until the new stuff... for now
[3:19:32] Buckwink: was SoB in 8.1?
[3:19:33] andy_4000: but if your not i think its fun
[3:19:34] ArcaneSyntax: darkshore wasnt a questing hub nothing to do there.
[3:19:36] mallicar: It feels more like this patch is taking the place of a .2 and we skipped .1
[3:19:37] Llamatude: what is blizzards plans for Greatvault if you already opened it.. are you just screwed
[3:19:44] KinggKebab: @MizixTV Very true. I just think people are being prisoners of the moment. Look at literally any other game that's come out the past year and a half during covid, Much less success than WoW even with WoW's success being questionable
[3:19:46] Tigerklaue: bfa 8.1 was just a raid...
[3:19:47] kokochris: what ever happened to the PVE warfront tech...
[3:19:47] Funderik: darkshore was just rare farming. not a hub
[3:19:49] ceranac23: Korthia is really good
[3:19:49] Buckwink: SoB and Kings Rest was 8.1 wasnt it?
[3:19:51] Araphas: darkshore was just World Quests right?
[3:19:53] Maylinn: We also waited longer for this .1 patch tho
[3:19:53] mallicar: As opposed to having a beefy .1
[3:20:00] Lundrai: I like SL more than BFA so far. BFA .0 and .1 patch was meh
[3:20:00] Mecabeast: we also got zandalari a few weeks after 8.1
[3:20:01] Aquadriel: Poondog no, that was at launch.
[3:20:05] ThaOriginalGamester: This is what development from home looks like, boys Keepo
[3:20:06] DragonofWolves: Watch people say next expansion SL was better than the previous. it happens every time
[3:20:08] filos0phia: I'm just so happy for assaults to be a thing again
[3:20:10] MistaHat: i mean, with how long it took, this is .2 because we probably wont get 9.3 @Towelliee
[3:20:14] H34T0N: LMAO that is exactly how I feel
[3:20:15] CritcobainTV: Wait a minute... Are you serious? Are you saying spending 2 hours trying to figure out how to summon one rare isn't the most fun you've ever had?!?
[3:20:19] nilachip: agree
[3:20:20] ichitos: I like the new pvp changes bursty meta
[3:20:24] magemaster225: If I could fly in korthia it would be fine, but running around feels terrible
[3:20:24] laughinbuddha: im just happy i can mount there
[3:20:25] ArcaneMaki: Visually it is not a beautiful zone (imo) as well. Boring to the eyes.
[3:20:30] RealBlankspace: RealBlankspace subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 78 months! Sending all the love man
[3:20:32] ShrenTheOrc: we did nothing but rare farm in mechagon
[3:20:34] jerexify: Guys, I'm famous on Twitter now. @Robx just followed me. lmao
[3:20:39] grapyz: I think its fine, I mean its the first week of the patch
[3:20:39] DaMotorBoater: timeless isles best
[3:20:40] kokochris: Naj landscape layout was ass
[3:20:43] Tigerklaue: mechagon was fun
[3:20:45] Alepouditsa: my mom was screaming at me coz i was catching pets and not doing quests with her LUL
[3:20:48] Araphas: Imagine if BFA didn't have the GCD changes
[3:20:48] cabalish: arent there dailys every day in korthia ?!!?
[3:20:51] DaBestGAround: Everything is time gated in Korthia. Even some of the rares are time gated
[3:20:52] nilachip: mecha was fine, naz bad
[3:20:54] IcefirePat: I decided to try WoW again after many months of not playing. I played for an hour, exited the game, never again.
[3:20:55] Aquadriel: 8.2 single handedly carried BfA and brought it from 'worst' expansion to a very good one.
[3:21:00] h_u_r_k_: naz sucked
[3:21:01] Lundrai: I dont mins the rare farming. mecha patch was the .2 patch
[3:21:01] ShrenTheOrc: mechagon wasnt this broken either lol
[3:21:03] aksel______: na looking at server list today again KEKW
[3:21:05] sbrice87: Some people already got the hand mount
[3:21:07] Mckhero: @Towelliee are mw's bad or something i dont see monks anymore
[3:21:07] BlueBeast33: Korthia just feels like a worse version of Mechagon & Nazjatar
[3:21:11] Unciatim: https://twitter.com/solanya_/status/1362889645827252230
[3:21:13] Allvarez: yeah 8.2 was when i came back to BFA
[3:21:15] Unciatim: LuL
[3:21:15] Aquadriel: @towelliee 8.2 single handedly carried BfA and brought it from 'worst' expansion to a very good one.
[3:21:17] filos0phia: I think korthia is very well designed level wise, idk about farming rares tho
[3:21:20] joshquigley19: @towelliee I haven’t been able to play for a few months and I still haven’t gotten the rare mounts form 9.0
[3:21:21] jerexify: @Towelliee I want my TD back... /cry
[3:21:22] vatoloco2355: Servers are down?
[3:21:25] pigzip: Also the waking safe rare was nuts
[3:21:29] slufftx: honestly it's just maw 2.0. I love wow. I've stayed through all the ups and downs, but korthia and the "new" torgahst. I think it's time for a break.
[3:21:29] othraerir: kill tormentors is one way, collect 200 chain links
[3:21:30] aksel______: random drop
[3:21:30] indigooo: "very good one"
[3:21:32] nyypsycho: Nah this is the vod from yesterday
[3:21:33] kowaikoro: tormenters has an drop chance
[3:21:35] theDirtyon3: IMagine being upset with new content in WoW... just admit you dont like WoW guys KEKw

[3:21:45] othraerir: ionjam
[3:21:45] emixy: Zzap
[3:21:45] cabalish: who was it ? IonJam
[3:21:46] ArcaneMaki: lol
[3:21:46] smashwow: LOL
[3:21:51] iblighters: idk man TD was fun for like a week and then I was over it

[3:22:07] Unciatim: Thought youd like that
[3:22:09] I_DoctorSatan_I: LUL LUL
[3:22:11] jerexify: TD was fucking amazing as a tank!
[3:22:13] captivate7: TD was so much fun lmao
[3:22:13] Masqerader: TD was amazing
[3:22:16] I_DoctorSatan_I: Chain of Ion
[3:22:17] xaragorn078: lul tou are not prepared! LUL
[3:22:20] Arcmourn: you think you do but you don't face
[3:22:24] Lundrai: TD broke the game
[3:22:27] ThaOriginalGamester: I loved corruptions and azerite gear... having different gear for different scenarios. having to sim and use training dummies to test builds
[3:22:27] Buckwink: I played dps and I got pissed seeing TD on the meters lol
[3:22:29] Aquadriel: corruption system was hell lots of fun. obtaining it, not so much.
[3:22:31] sbrice87: There are 4 different versions of the hand and one is from the new events in the maw. The tormented event thing I believe
[3:22:32] Todmeister9000: KEKW
[3:22:33] smashwow: boomies are not prepared Kappa
[3:22:33] Mostdangspy: @Towelliee is the wow community ever satisfied. Seems like there are complaints for everything
[3:22:39] felblazes: i need my TD back im going insane
[3:22:39] dinomiyte: did u see that hand mount!!!???? i need that shit
[3:22:43] ArcaneMaki: I think they just need to mix it up a little bit. Change Ion and Christie. Not that they are not appropriate for the role, but maybe WoW need a fresh vision.
[3:22:54] theDirtyon3: people are dumb KEKW
[3:23:03] kowaikoro: KEKW
[3:23:05] I_DoctorSatan_I: new TomCat's Tour update available FYI
[3:23:05] CritcobainTV: https://twitter.com/bigdumbgaming/status/1410238364972900353/photo/1
[3:23:06] Lundrai: corruptions in general broke the game lol
[3:23:10] Masqerader: There was nothing more fun than visions of perfection procing as a DH and your health boosted to 1.6 million and TD procs and hits mobs for like 1.2 million
[3:23:27] Felrane: I just dont bother with new patches for the first month
[3:23:32] Dark_quack: YOU LIKING 9.1 SO FAR?
[3:23:46] joshquigley19: @towelliee do you remember that rextroy video of him stacking tier 3 infinite stars and it was one shifting people in arena LUL miss those days sometimes
[3:23:49] theDirtyon3: this patch has actually gone pretty smooth

[3:24:09] othraerir: lag in ardenweald was horrendous
[3:24:10] grokshar: wait what servers are again offline??

[3:24:33] MizixTV: @grokshar maintainence...
[3:24:34] mavericks312: @smashwow thank covid for that
[3:24:39] TarMonA: i didnt raid nor keys

[3:24:42] grokshar: @MizixTV OMEGALUL
[3:24:43] TylordKY: why Is everyone online but you 🥺
[3:24:44] theDirtyon3: how do people not understand that?
[3:24:46] I_DoctorSatan_I: just blame COVID Kappa
[3:24:46] onous_: Covid didnt happen
[3:24:46] CritcobainTV: yeah it took 7 months because they were hanging out on bobbys fucking yachts 😡
[3:24:47] Felrane: Blizz must be set up super getto
[3:24:48] Kayver_: old warrior tanking was tough, only being able to hit 1, 2, or 4 things at a time
[3:24:48] Th3Hammer: @Towelliee I totally agree
[3:24:48] joshquigley19: @towelliee didn’t he solo a boss from nyalotha
[3:24:53] Dark_quack: damn you covid-19
[3:25:00] furansowah: Loved the corruption idea. Let us run crazy with builds while we wait for the new expansion. Like my full haste Destro Lock was insanely fun to play
[3:25:03] idenkaz_: covid effected alot of people on a personal level have some empathy for them
[3:25:06] andy_4000: we need to give them the benefit of the doubt
[3:25:10] Howells_tv: half of 9.2 is going to be pushed back 9.1 content
[3:25:15] Kayver_: and all pally tanks had to do is consecrate
[3:25:20] Buckwink: corruption vendors was amazing
[3:25:25] theDirtyon3: @re23333 dud stop with that you are just making shit up lol
[3:25:26] Lundrai: I'm not mad at the devs. they work their butts off. it's the management...
[3:25:29] Aquadriel: i loved corruption and how crazy could get with different builds and different classes @Towelliee
[3:25:33] Mitune: You can be annoyed with them not just being up front and saying it's not going to be the best but the best they can do right now
[3:25:38] Buckwink: i built full crit corruption on my hunter and I loved it
[3:25:41] CritcobainTV: Build a bear KEKW
[3:25:43] Tigerklaue: corruption was so much fun after we got the vendor
[3:25:48] Coppermedusa357: CORRUPTION WAS FUN ONCE THE VENDOR WAS ADDED
[3:25:51] ic3k0ld: if I can finsh everything with one build, I go with one build
[3:25:55] MizixTV: I quit BFA because of Corruption... lmao worst system ever implemented
[3:25:57] flebbooo: true, it was something unique. Yes it was busted but it was fun for the moment LUL
[3:25:57] Alepouditsa: @furansowah the pvpers are the cry babys on the corruption
[3:25:59] theDirtyon3: @re23333 its 15 years old people are bound to leave thats fucking live lol
[3:26:01] ArcaneMaki: I'm a game dev and everything got delayed. WFH to now be Hybrid took a long time to be functional (and notice I'm just saying functional and not efficient cause it is not still).
[3:26:03] Masqerader: and after doing visions, it was nice getting revenge on those fuckers in 5 mask and 1 shotting fucking Rexxar
[3:26:03] Aquadriel: re23333 hey nobody asked for your opinion, gtfo kid.
[3:26:04] j_giggles: Corruption was lit
[3:26:07] Donnicton: dumper KEKW
[3:26:08] grokshar: LOLW
[3:26:09] belfastcl: i feel like build variety is something wow could improve
[3:26:12] I_DoctorSatan_I: REKT
[3:26:14] grokshar: LITTY
[3:26:15] Wavekingg: @Towelliee How much renown can we this week?
[3:26:16] brian99000: 8.3 was actually fun asf and I miss it
[3:26:17] Buckwink: nah corruption was awesome
[3:26:18] Aquadriel: i loved corruption and how crazy could get with different builds and different classes @Towelliee
[3:26:22] Dixeerekt: I miss it a lot
[3:26:23] dhands: Corruption was lit once we had the vendor
[3:26:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: towRekt towRekt towRekt
[3:26:24] CritcobainTV: I thought corruption was fun if you got the right shit early on. having to farm it later for specifics was boring
[3:26:25] pereadin: corruption was fun af
[3:26:26] Mckhero: i started expansion 2 days ago seems alright so far lol
[3:26:26] Felrane: The way you got corruption gear sucked ass but the effects were fun.
[3:26:30] FergusCreative: Corruption was so broken but in a good way haha
[3:26:31] othraerir: 2 @Wavekingg pretty sur anyway
[3:26:34] Skaadooossh: yea it was so fun as even tanks were doing shit load of damage with TD's etc
[3:26:34] Dixeerekt: full expedient 3 gachiHYPER
[3:26:35] Howells_tv: corruption reception would of been much better if it was easier to target at the start
[3:26:36] snipsfan: corruption is like "not knowing what you till its gone" :(
[3:26:37] slick1729: i thought corruption was fun, i just didnt like the buggy aspect of it. Like Tol Dagor Twighlight D flying through walls
[3:26:39] Tigerklaue: corruption tank only raid with td
[3:26:42] oRiie: Only thing annoying about corruption was pvp, gushing wounds can f off
[3:26:44] grokshar: the problem with blizz is that they throw every system in the garbage after the xpac ends
[3:26:44] Wavekingg: @othraerir Oh ok ty!
[3:26:45] FergusCreative: We spent the last 14 years being the heros and not feeling it
[3:26:51] smashwow: effects were amazing. the system for gathering them. nah fam
[3:26:51] Aquadriel: but the rotation pepega
[3:26:53] xaiikii: 1.2 million healt with TD : D that was fun
[3:26:53] idenkaz_: corruption did nothing wrong!
[3:26:54] j_giggles: Absolutely loved corruption attack speed build
[3:26:56] FalconBroadcasting: Corruption was nice for players like you who frequently got opportunities for loot and rolled on all kinds of corrupt effects. Casual players rarely saw any, but needed it desperately.
[3:26:57] Alienfromger: but its not fun for the non op :(
[3:26:59] madmat93: corruption was pretty fun with a "random hyper dps" and it was satisfying
[3:27:05] Heatinup: Corruption was dope, the only downside is for high end competative due to the RNG but otherwise the system was so fun
[3:27:06] Buckwink: yeah once we got the vendor and stuff you could make crazy builds
[3:27:07] Aquadriel: people still salty about rotation vendor lmao @Towelliee
[3:27:10] Lundrai: I was kinda meh on corruption
[3:27:14] jridablo: but if you OP everyone need to he OP or they'll complain so if everyone OP it cancel it out lol
[3:27:18] nocturnal_2195: I mean if they could have gotten the patch out sooner they would have theres no way they just they where like hey let's delay this patch for 7 months and piss of the whole community
[3:27:20] andy_4000: wow players 9.1 comes out when 9.2 coming
[3:27:21] feodin: I think when people say they hate corruption, they mean the acquisition of it
[3:27:26] joshquigley19: Borrowed power @towelliee
[3:27:30] cookiemonstersex: Corruption was amazing. I can see why the 1% pvpers didn't like it thou
[3:27:31] chronoit: my only complaint about corruption was how dependent runs inside the visions were on TD for tanks. You basically couldn't do it without stacking TD
[3:27:33] theDirtyon3: 100% haste destro Kreygasm
[3:27:33] joshquigley19: LUL
[3:27:34] Masqerader: We had a fucking vendor for it LOL
[3:27:35] dozedr: unholy dk with full hastes was dope, my gcd was so fast i couldnt even press buttons fast enough
[3:27:36] Wcvechten: even WQ gave them
[3:27:38] idenkaz_: even world quest drops had corruption sometimes
[3:27:40] filos0phia: the vault had near guarenteed corruption at the end
[3:27:40] Buckwink: dude there was corruption gear from WQs what you mean lol
[3:27:40] jrossino: Td was so fun in mythics
[3:27:43] sphynx_rayne: Yes I played part time and i got it all the time
[3:27:46] filos0phia: it was like 90% chance to be corrupted

[3:27:46] rurounijosh: wasnt it completely rng though?
[3:27:47] pereadin: then you could farm corruption!
[3:27:48] MrTerkyMan: I played like 2 weeks of 9.3 and had 3 or 4 pieces
[3:27:48] cheersfordoobies: you got corruption with 80 corruption on it
[3:27:50] SeckSymbols: corruption was awesome, just not acquisition
[3:27:51] Felrane: garbage ilvl corruption
[3:27:53] cheersfordoobies: not useable
[3:27:54] kokochris: Corruption was ok,we all knew what it was for and it wouldn't stay.
[3:27:57] Putcride: I got alot of corruption even though i did less raiding and participating in bfa
[3:28:01] FalconBroadcasting: I'm sorry, rarely got enough rolls for the corruption you NEEDED. You could have ANY corruption, but face it, some corruptions were better than others.
[3:28:02] Mitteennss: i didnt like corruption because it made Mediocre plays do well in a raid if they just got good procs and or stacked a certain stat
[3:28:03] dhands: The worst thing about corruption was wearing a 430 item in Mythic raid because it had Infinite Stars 3 on it
[3:28:04] sphynx_rayne: I wasn't that op but I was getting there
[3:28:04] Deathlydeal: i think i logged in 1 time and got a corruption peice
[3:28:08] blade_killa: true LUL
[3:28:09] Bakuryuha96: @rurounijosh no they added a vendor
[3:28:09] kashmara: I'm casual AF, and I had corruption out the ass.
[3:28:11] westelan_: servers down? ouch
[3:28:14] CritcobainTV: the corruption RNG was poopshit early on though. it sucked to be excluded over other people at the start because they RNG'd the bis corruptio
[3:28:17] CritcobainTV: corruption
[3:28:17] Aquadriel: people still salty about rotation vendor lmao @Towelliee
[3:28:21] PvtHudson093: gated off picking specific corruptions but you still got corruption everywhere
[3:28:21] filos0phia: I never did mythic raids and got almost full 475 with vers corruptions
[3:28:24] Buckwink: man bfa was good as hell for what it was
[3:28:24] pereadin: Echoes of Nyalotha
[3:28:25] Mecabeast: people one shotting themselves on maut from td and stars

[3:28:32] Hammerpain: i had full corruption set for my DK and I'm a casual player. In a guild but not a lot of people in it so hard to go full raid and dungeon run
[3:28:36] titanknighttv: @Towelliee TD was the best thing that happened for tanks

[3:28:40] gfield2k: Good morning @Towelliee an chat. Just waking up, how long have servers been down ?
[3:28:46] xsp00n: I think at the end of BFA corruption was nice, but if they did corruption in lets say legion it wouldnt work
[3:28:47] rurounijosh: the grind was too much...
[3:28:52] idenkaz_: we did BfA dirty, fight me :-(
[3:28:53] dozedr: @Towelliee true, only downside was 0 inventory space cuz of all the corruption i was hoarding lmao
[3:28:58] Skaadooossh: yep
[3:29:00] montypythoon: @westelan_ it was legit announced as soon as they knew about the GV bug
[3:29:02] Masqerader: I feel all the people who hated corruption are the same players who bitch and moan and complain about everything in WOW
[3:29:06] sweetsamisue: HeyGuys

[3:29:15] MizixTV: @gfield2k just down for maintenance should be up soon
[3:29:15] xsp00n: they should put anima powers on gear in 9.3 in lieu of corruption
[3:29:15] nocturnal_2195: I actually played the most in 8.3 and as a tank I loved TD
[3:29:16] Lundrai: I like for things to make sense. Corruption made things not make sense where 30 ilvls wouldnt matter because rng lol corruption proc
[3:29:18] yobroyobroyo: Perfect for a full time streamer LUL
[3:29:22] Aquadriel: @Towelliee they had 2 options for vendor: 1) put all corruption since begining but make them SUPER EXPLENSIVE, so people would take weeks to obtain. 2) rotation.
[3:29:25] iblighters: Until it killed a pack and you healer wasn't ready on a bursting week
[3:29:27] Buckwink: AP farm is needed in current wow
[3:29:27] westelan_: did blizz say whats up with the offline servers? @towelliee
[3:29:29] Broomba: the grind in legion and bfa was awesome, sl grind sucks
[3:29:33] TarMonA: good time to update adddon KEKW
[3:29:34] epiczplz: are we even mmo players if we think the grind is to much?
[3:29:34] Alepouditsa: yea i love the to work to something then do raids
[3:29:42] idenkaz_: i think 8.2 was the best content patch in the history of WoW.
[3:29:43] ArcaneMaki: Just the story that was meh to me. Still can't believe we did not get rid of the giant Sargeras sword.
[3:29:46] tungexd: i remember getting my t3 twilight dev from heroic nzoth sword, i was hyped
[3:30:00] smashwow: raid logging wouldn't be a bad thing, if there were other games to play. FF is a decent gap fill, but honestly most of the wow players using FF as a gap fill won't stick with it.
[3:30:06] k0ridian: server down???
[3:30:07] I_DoctorSatan_I: man, I checked the AH on my server (Duskwood),Korthite Crystals are going for 22k a pop LUL
[3:30:08] 2naDlisch: The grind needs to be fun, though
[3:30:08] imagine6917: ap>
[3:30:11] iblighters: I don't mind a grind as long as it doesn't feel pointless
[3:30:13] Buckwink: we can all agree benthic gear was a mistake
[3:30:15] AceOfTheNorth: I like to grind but I also want the ability to take time off if I choose to.
[3:30:17] flebbooo: Yeah idk i really want to see more progress in my character, i had 220 ish ilvl around january and now i have been 225 for months LUL
[3:30:18] PvtHudson093: I liked my neck getting better as i collected AP
[3:30:24] ice_ross: rather have people complaining while logging in everyday than nobody playing tbh
[3:30:28] Bulletpunchs: keys?
[3:30:30] pereadin: hopefully the new M+ scoring system and upgrade update fixes that
[3:30:32] Tigerklaue: anima is pointless after you have the mounts
[3:30:38] sweetsamisue: Came back in 8.2 after having to take a break due to health reasons. I didn't mind it.
[3:30:45] iblighters: The sockets weere a mistake the gear was fine
[3:30:46] idenkaz_: cool for catch up tho
[3:30:46] grokshar: benthic was like slots LULW
[3:30:48] Kisswani: didn't the loud voices in the community ask for that tho ? to be able to get BiS an be done ?
[3:30:48] othraerir: didn't they nerf the values on the gems too?
[3:30:51] Felrane: I liked 8.2 of BFA but not the rest really
[3:30:51] Hargy_: we far off towelie?
[3:30:53] BlueBeast33: Part of the problem with the endless grinds is the world content in this game is dogshit
[3:30:59] KinggKebab: Might be unpopular, but I actually prefer logging on and having actual power to grind. This "everything is optional and doesn't affect your character" is pretty meh
[3:31:02] MizixTV: I loved AP and AP lol Islands were my top favorite part of BFA besides Vulperan lol
[3:31:03] idenkaz_: 100%
[3:31:08] montypythoon: @Kisswani not at all what ? lmao
[3:31:13] PvtHudson093: EP was a cool raid
[3:31:14] Stormin27: I just got a beer commercial FeelsGoodMan
[3:31:15] Mostdangspy: Is this a fix to the 9.1 patch?
[3:31:15] Buckwink: I would go to mechagon just to hang out sometimes, I loved it there
[3:31:16] ic3k0ld: @SollowJP why get rid of a sword hurting the planet when we can harvest the planet for power, makes sense right?!
[3:31:17] Eastwicksavag3: 8.2 was amazing
[3:31:27] filos0phia: @MizixTV Vulperans fuck yeah
[3:31:31] Stormin27: LUL
[3:31:33] filos0phia: bfa was the best
[3:31:33] mwchaos: fuckin blows
[3:31:36] flebbooo: oh yeah it was so awful LULW
[3:31:38] smashwow: @pereadin it'll help some but not as much as it could. i really think they keep missing the mark on M+ rewards.
[3:31:43] Kisswani: @zoltarek999 I remember ppl cheering for " let loot be loot " and the reduced loot amouint
[3:31:46] TinmanFPS: stuff they could have figured out with polls
[3:31:47] Kisswani: yeah exactly
[3:31:49] grapyz: For some one who started at the very end of bfa, I enjoy SL lmao. But maybe that's because I didn't experience anything else
[3:31:56] joshquigley19: @towelliee when you really look at it all bfa patches had their ups and down but still bfa>shadowlands
[3:32:01] Felrane: we wanted less random loot
[3:32:04] PvtHudson093: Even that was too late
[3:32:04] kowaikoro: everyone felt good week 1 when loot was actually dropping KEKW
[3:32:06] idenkaz_: they listened to the wrong people if i may say that
[3:32:13] montypythoon: @Kisswani people cheering for lack of loot? mustve been a troll post
[3:32:17] Butanogas: Shadowlands are focking amazing!!!
[3:32:18] Dookeyy: they give out to many purples, they need a fine balance between blues and purps
[3:32:18] ArcaneMaki: I miss Legion so much
[3:32:18] ic3k0ld: more loot and less choir-like grind is what we want
[3:32:39] kokochris: too much loot danLUL
[3:32:39] CritcobainTV: i said it Kappa
[3:32:42] iblighters: lol like 40+ pieces of gear in my bags at one point in BfA
[3:32:46] NinjaGlovz: KEKW KEKW KEKW
[3:32:46] MizixTV: @Towelliee We were saying we let loot be loot as in no Titanforging or Warforging lol we just wanted our piece to be what it was
[3:32:55] grokshar: blizz fixes problems that they created lol
[3:33:04] jridablo: you can tell they dont play their own game hahahaha
[3:33:12] MistaHat: I was smile :)
[3:33:17] ic3k0ld: @grokshar that is clearly by design
[3:33:19] buffkenobi: I've ran PF 30 times on my rogue and still no phial. Drop rates suck dick @Towelliee
[3:33:27] Killstuff: not to mention it diminishes the good feeling of getting loot if u get so much trash
[3:33:30] Chuuggrz: Mr_Moose101 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:33:30] Masqerader: What people were saying was "I am sick of seeing useless shit in my mythic + chest" Then we got the great vault and we got the same useless loot :P
[3:33:31] Murphybrown: the metrics showed fun levels too high, blizz said pump the brakes
[3:33:35] BakedWeeb: sup towelliee!
[3:33:37] Th3Hammer: Good points well said
[3:33:49] Felrane: blizz created problems being fixed with bandaids
[3:33:55] healmeshammy: boosted lol
[3:33:56] ArcaneMaki: Issues I see at the moment is the Story/Lore team seems so disconnected from Game Design/System team and both teams do not seem to connect well.
[3:33:57] idenkaz_: like locking an entire system to upgrade your gear behind KSM KEKW that was something man
[3:33:59] TarMonA: i think it full hour down time
[3:34:02] Broomba: true, thats part of the problem with SL
[3:34:03] MistaHat: TBC Small loot drops make sense because the game is slower, there are more bosses and it is easier so it isnt a slog to get them
[3:34:07] k0ridian: 17 years of bandaids looks like this..
[3:34:07] xsp00n: yeah cause it doesnt need to be good, cause retail can piggyback off subs from TBCC and eventually WoTLKC
[3:34:08] Moobot: Download RAID: Shadow Legends for free on mobile or PC and get a special new players reward https://clik.cc/rUFft If you want to support my channel, please, reach lvl 10. Thanks!
[3:34:11] mwchaos: the intro skip for alts though im so glad thats a thing, best part of 9.1 so far lol
[3:34:21] DragonofWolves: I honestly feel SL is more a fan service to the lore people. but that's about it
[3:34:22] Unciatim: People said.. Too much borrowed power loot systems.... Blizz- ok, you think so... Wait till you SL
[3:34:28] BakedWeeb: ye it should be deterministic if its gonna take that long
[3:34:28] montypythoon: @mwchaos bruh you dont even know yet :D chapters are accountwide Pog
[3:34:32] jrossino: The only saviour to this patch will be the raid imo
[3:34:36] Mitune: My conspiracy / hopeium is that the retail blizz team is split with the majority working on 10.0 since before SL launch
[3:34:39] Kisswani: which is why i loved titanforging , the occasional surprise upgrades
[3:34:40] H34T0N: I still had Sorrowbane until a month into the expansion Lol
[3:34:41] jrossino: The raid gear is real nice
[3:34:42] PoGelo: WOW... love rocket have new animation :O
[3:34:44] Panadol324: what addon shows all box's and other like that in the new zone ?
[3:34:49] stallowned: mornin towel and chat towHAMUP
[3:34:53] montypythoon: @mwchaos 9.1 looking like the alt patch
[3:34:58] joshquigley19: I think that if I run lfr for transmog in castle Nathria and go 10/10 for the week and get absolutely no loot for 2 weeks in a row, that sucks
[3:35:05] CritcobainTV: @stallowned towHAMUP
[3:35:06] kaze171: @Towelliee why are the covenant tabard appearances locked behind which covenant you chose now?
[3:35:11] Rottencoarse: 8 more months @Towelliee
[3:35:19] ArcaneMaki: But once again, raid is Torghast theme, so once again I feel like I saw it all already.
[3:35:25] othraerir: 100%
[3:35:28] Mecabeast: only a month h3at?
[3:35:33] Arcaedio: control it how?..
[3:35:35] ChimmyNeutron: It was definitely a product of them trying new things. 9.2 will be the last major patch of this expac then we will see what the future holds
[3:35:42] NinjaGlovz: True
[3:35:49] Felrane: The first phase of systems tend to be the best. Titanforging in Throne was good. After that went to shit
[3:35:52] Broomba: @oRiie - nope, its not spreadsheets and analytics they listened to the upper tier raiders and tried something that failed
[3:35:55] MrTerkyMan: IMO Gear like BC would be great. Multiple sockets, potentially with color bonuses, enchants on nearly every slot, and hell bring reforging back. I like feeling invested in my gear
[3:35:57] Unciatim: Yea... Blizz- we hear you but we just didnt' care for your opinion
[3:36:01] BakedWeeb: I've always preferred WoW's gameplay cause when wow is good... its good, but I raid in XIV and a mix of the justice/valor system and badges for savage bosses there means I know I will be geared after X lockouts. It takes a while, but you know when it will happen.
[3:36:06] JLmorten: too much work to control it. easier to remove completely
[3:36:06] mavericks312: this last short patch xpac we got the next xpac was a banger
[3:36:07] Mitune: titanforging with the ability to reforge stats again would have been nice
[3:36:10] MistaHat: I personally like the gearing in retail a lot right now, of course improvements can be made...cough badge vendors...but they just need to add more stuff to do outside of gearing stuff. and this is from me, a mythic raider. I do like collections but other aspects would be nice too
[3:36:11] Alienfromger: we hear you but fuck you LUL
[3:36:12] PhatnissEverdeen: He heard, didn’t listen
[3:36:17] Mathhbm: Thunderforge in MoP wasnt better?
[3:36:19] Buckwink: titanforging wasnt even bad, it gave you a reason to farm high keys
[3:36:26] Mathhbm: Didnt played Legion
[3:36:29] mrpresbaby: @McJezuss now's a great time to come back. lots of catch up stuff has been implemented including gear in Korthia
[3:36:40] grokshar: @Mathhbm legion was fun but rng fuckfest
[3:36:44] MistaHat: @Mathhbm man, you missed out on the best modern expac
[3:36:56] CritcobainTV: Legion classic when?!
[3:37:03] Rottencoarse: @mrpresbaby yeah korthia which has like 10 fps right?? -.-
[3:37:08] Eastwicksavag3: doesn't that defeat the purpose of tf?
[3:37:11] CritcobainTV: I'll be playing that shit if ti comes out 100%
[3:37:14] mrpresbaby: I think Mythic shouldn't get titanforging since it's already highest ilvl gear
[3:37:16] Aquadriel: @Towelliee should have manage TF like they manage valor upgrade on SL. "you beat Normal? ok now you can titanforge to this level" etc.
[3:37:19] icemanj99: imagine Bliz not listening to it's player base
[3:37:25] SrpskaLegija: Remember my Normal Font from Azshara with higher itemlevel then mythic xD
[3:37:32] montypythoon: @Rottencoarse how tf do you have 10fps in korthia lmao wat
[3:37:35] Mathhbm: @Mathhbm Really? Like a lot of friends say was bad, only Nighthold patch was good
[3:37:36] KragnosWoW: I wonder if they would skip WoD classic if it came to that point in blizzards lifetime
[3:37:37] Zr0_gg: It's nice having a BIS list without factoring in with slot machine rolls.

[3:37:45] Aquadriel: pepegaforged
[3:37:45] Wrongwaykid: Like original warforging before they added titanforging
[3:37:47] BakedWeeb: I loved legion man. I was really into late HW/Stormblood for XIV at the time and Legion legit made me rather play WoW
[3:37:47] flebbooo: i mean they had tunderforging for a while LUL
[3:37:47] Buckwink: shadowforged
[3:37:48] filos0phia: mawforged
[3:37:50] Technogre: Bansheforfed Kappa
[3:37:51] largon52: Those glasses are cool 😎
[3:37:55] rumply4skin4u: the worst decision they made was making the story time gated to 9 weeks. time gate gear time gate rep but let us finish the story cause I dont want little bits every week
[3:37:59] joshquigley19: @towelliee my other big complaint with shadowlands is I liked farming world quests but now they take forever and the rewards suck for the time spent.
[3:37:59] Aquadriel: @Towelliee should have manage TF like they manage valor upgrade on SL. "you beat Normal? ok now you can titanforge to this level" etc.
[3:37:59] the0_o: banshee touched
[3:38:01] k0ridian: @filos0phia i see Mawforged
[3:38:04] grokshar: COPIUMforged
[3:38:06] montypythoon: @the0_o +1
[3:38:07] ic3k0ld: I've heard a lot about another game recently that listens to their community really well and don't care if you take breaks fromtheir game
[3:38:09] Lestatis: deathtouched
[3:38:11] BakedWeeb: Like legion had mistakes too, but a lot can be forgiven cause it was new stuff and systems
[3:38:21] FalconBroadcasting: It sounds like shitforge. Like, how much more would the ilvl be? I like limiting forging towards the top of difficult content, but for lwer content, let that shit fly.
[3:38:24] Masqerader: Sylvanas forged and the corruption effect is sloots cables chain you in place
[3:38:24] BakedWeeb: BFA just learned all the wrong lessions from legion
[3:38:28] dinomiyte: do you have a certain clan in raid: shadow legends?
[3:38:31] Technogre: Jailbroken
[3:38:32] Eastwicksavag3: idk tf from a heroic to mythic gear yeah ...not lfr though
[3:38:39] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee eu is kind of bad as well on korthia it still has like 10 fps or w/e
[3:38:40] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:38:40] bolfrost: what's the current renown cap?
[3:38:41] filos0phia: and we don't have to jump thru hoops to fly either
[3:38:45] SpectralExa: A patch earlier? That assumes we get another patch lol
[3:38:45] Mathhbm: @MistaHat But compared with BfA and SL, Legion prob is way way better even for me that didnt played LUL
[3:38:45] PvtHudson093: 9.2 in Jan
[3:38:45] aikopooh: i dont like about wqs those that u need to climb or fly or jump hoops lolz
[3:38:49] filos0phia: to me, that's huge
[3:38:54] rumply4skin4u: your not flying for another 2 months so its not early
[3:38:57] ThaOriginalGamester: they had to give you something, they knew what this patch was gonna look like LUL
[3:38:57] gimmlay: eternalforged
[3:38:59] Broomba: @BakedWeeb bfa actually capitalized off the legion system and modified it to fit bfa system
[3:38:59] astranna: warforge to me is fine, 5-10 ilvl upgrades. after that its too much
[3:39:05] supremedapharaoh: 80 renown now I believe
[3:39:06] kokochris: or maw

[3:39:16] CCG_337: maybe 8.2 is final patch then next expansion
[3:39:16] Renzay83: LUL
[3:39:18] FergusCreative: What happens do you hit a wall?
[3:39:19] MizixTV: @rumply4skin4u we can fly week 3 or 4 of patch lol
[3:39:19] filos0phia: I'm definitely gonna try
[3:39:20] flebbooo: first thing
[3:39:22] Masqerader: I will test it for science
[3:39:23] Kisswani: @Eastwicksavag3 even then , what were the chances of an LFR player getting a mythic level TF . didn't see that as an issue tbh
[3:39:27] dinomiyte: lmao
[3:39:28] the0_o: Can you fly in the Maw?
[3:39:29] Poriand: flying is less exciting cuz we cant fly between zones
[3:39:30] r1ftzxd: not being able to fly between zones is lame
[3:39:36] hooliggan: They should just make portals between zones for flyting
[3:39:39] jeflag: challenge accepted
[3:39:42] Felrane: How far the zones are apart is crazy. I got a flying bug where i took a que mid port and took 15 mins to get back
[3:39:44] othraerir: just checking the math
[3:39:47] filos0phia: there's so many little islands off of the maldraxxus I want to check out
[3:39:49] Mathhbm: @hooliggan This!!!
[3:39:53] MistaHat: @Mathhbm bfa - 8.3 was really fun if you took a break. SL was fun...for about 5 months in if you were a raider or gear grinder which i am. now im just in tbc classic because the gearing makes sense and i enjoy the break with laid back raiding
[3:39:53] rumply4skin4u: @mizixtv they said finish the campaign quest. thats not for 9 weeks
[3:39:57] tebbix: True
[3:39:59] Sheepfu: I love how FFXIV handles flying.
[3:40:00] Kisswani: Flying is what makes me level alts
[3:40:01] MizixTV: @rumply4skin4u negative
[3:40:02] largon52: I have get on flight path to get back to orbitos?
[3:40:04] joshquigley19: @towelliee let’s try it next week LUL
[3:40:07] matrixr666: have u find a way to transfers soul ash to your alt ?
[3:40:11] MizixTV: @rumply4skin4u its week 3 or 4 of campaign
[3:40:17] BakedWeeb: @Broomba I think BFA had good ideas that did build off Legion, just the execution in game didnt work. Idk if it was due to budget cuts or lack of dev insight and tbh we will never know
[3:40:20] Aquadriel: @Towelliee its 2.0 because it takes 2 times more time complete.

[3:40:23] BlueBeast33: world quests got old after a couple months back in Legion
[3:40:25] LumLFM: How many people are doing world quests though. I know one guy out of ~50 doing it for anima.
[3:40:26] devildriver1919: when flying is out, ill need to lvl over 30+ chars
[3:40:28] CritcobainTV: Swoop there it is
[3:40:32] xsp00n: @towelliee no it wouldn't, they are all layered on top of each other, that's why it doesn't work. remember that falling through the world bug where we saw each zone
[3:40:37] TheKitsuneAdventures: what tank class should i level up
[3:40:40] Secondbreakfasttt: Has to be in torghast
[3:40:41] kraydom: Nah titan forge world quest rewards were epic.
[3:40:42] eMBeaR64oz: ya
[3:40:44] BakedWeeb: like I loved corruptions as a concept, but the way you got them was not idea
[3:40:45] akaasti: I am honestly ok with the content in this first week. Gives me time to get my other tanks caught up
[3:40:47] ThaOriginalGamester: i can only either world quest/story mode or do dungeons. I don't have time to do both anymore and it bums me out
[3:40:48] jamarky23: You seem way happier playing Classic and FF14 tbh
[3:40:51] Dropzone34: I need to find that and transfer ash to my monk
[3:40:51] matrixr666: never found it in torghast
[3:40:53] akia03: was suppose to be bonsemith guy in korthia
[3:40:53] Mitune: it's in torg isn't it?
[3:40:54] Broomba: @BakedWeeb i think bfa was great and really worked for what it was designed to do with the heart of azeroth similar to AP.
[3:41:00] Masqerader: I really hate how they make u pick up callings and just don't have the damn emissary tab like they did in Legion/BFA
[3:41:02] joshquigley19: @towelliee maybe if world quest rewards were more meaningful I’d do them more
[3:41:04] CritcobainTV: towOny
[3:41:10] BlueBeast33: Blizz has no idea how to make compelling world content
[3:41:14] CritcobainTV: She's so fuckin cute man
[3:41:17] icemanj99: Did they fix druid flight form not working once you unlock flying? Early PTR it wasn't working correctly
[3:41:18] matrixr666: completed a 9 , last vendor didnt have it on him
[3:41:19] CritcobainTV: i miss my pupper
[3:41:21] ScottyMcDavern: the vendor is near the great vault i think
[3:41:27] TheKitsuneAdventures: towOny towOny towOny towOny
[3:41:27] Aquadriel: @Towelliee imagine having a skip for new content but NOT for 6 month old content (maw intro) KEKW
[3:41:32] ArcaneMaki: OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[3:41:47] Doomedsaint: Will you get 2 or 3 renown this week doing everything?
[3:41:50] ciranidd: the maw intro is supposed to be a soft roadblock to bots LUL
[3:41:54] hooliggan: The banner on the launcher went away
[3:41:55] I_DoctorSatan_I: just being in Korthia and doing all the main quests, you'll have more than enough 1k to "replenish the Resevior" weekly.
[3:41:57] matrixr666: thank u , i will look when server are up

[3:42:03] DaBestGAround: @Doomedsaint 2 renown
[3:42:05] SteelEm: chat
[3:42:09] Buckwink: yeah I do too
[3:42:19] Endin: thought they fixed that?
[3:42:20] filos0phia: the remaking leggos is nonsense, I really hope they fix that
[3:42:26] cevyr1: I'm waiting until the covenant leggo since it is my new BIS
[3:42:32] Doomedsaint: @AssumingControlOfThisForm thanks
[3:42:32] Tabbzterr: I saw you were streaming WoW and came on here to figure out how you were online, but I see now lmfao
[3:42:36] YoHizen: @SteelEm you cant, have to earn it on each alt
[3:42:37] othraerir: i did the skip, it skips the maw
[3:42:50] ic3k0ld: wish we could "want" to create new stuff and not "have" to, you know
[3:42:51] Howells_tv: fuck the anima
[3:42:53] flebbooo: omg KEKW
[3:42:54] idenkaz_: KEKW
[3:42:56] KinggKebab: Btw, that skip, is the best skip they've ever implemented.
[3:42:58] Aquadriel: fuck it, i got all my anima already from the drought KEKW
[3:42:58] sometimes_yuki: its worth the skip haha
[3:42:58] Felrane: you can skip maw now i thought
[3:42:59] grokshar: KEKW
[3:42:59] CritcobainTV: @othraerir nah he means the lvl 50 one
[3:43:05] Buckwink: and the maw intro is the worst fucking one LULW
[3:43:09] stallowned: thats such a troll lol
[3:43:09] Mathhbm: they nerfed the maw intro btw, back give more than 1 level KEKW
[3:43:10] Dark_quack: @when do you think we will gte 9.2?
[3:43:11] Clicklesly: You also lose the lego item with the skip :/
[3:43:17] othraerir: i know what he meant
[3:43:18] nocturnal_2195: @towelliee don't worry that will come in 10.0
[3:43:22] Xailen: the skips not giving the rewards is baseline stupid
[3:43:22] Colt_Engineer: @towelliee you don't need to remake your leggos. upgrading them gives you a socket.
[3:43:22] Spotmonk: without the maw intro you wouldn't have enough storyline to hit 60
[3:43:25] CritcobainTV: Alright servers. Get yo asses up

[3:43:26] grokshar: and giving blizz money lol
[3:43:28] Felrane: wow is too old and getto
[3:43:28] Naturalbeef: The Maw intro is basically a free level though
[3:43:30] After43ver: sup Towelliee and chat o/
[3:43:33] I_DoctorSatan_I: because it's CHAINS OF ION 9.1 Kappa 4Head
[3:43:34] Renzay83: the maw intro is like 30 mins and you get a level out of it, its not so bad
[3:43:34] joshquigley19: The kyrian legendary at renown 48 is looking pretty good are you gonna use it?
[3:43:45] austin_114: Maw intro gets very tiring when you take multiple alts through it
[3:43:48] ciranidd: i was told, but havent tried, that if you get ported /summoned to oribos you can skip the maw intro, but how would you get a cov then?
[3:43:48] aikopooh: yesterday i pushed trough maw starting zone on my priest dh and it was painful...
[3:43:49] ArcaneSyntax: just make a rank 5, wont cost you anything extra.

[3:43:50] CritcobainTV: towRee making leggos
[3:43:52] filos0phia: they need to make it so upgrading a legendary that is applicable for a socket, gets the socket
[3:43:55] filos0phia: domination sockets aside
[3:43:56] devildriver1919: it will be better now that you can mount on your alts in the maw, if you didnt get the shadehound mounts
[3:43:59] EthicalHermit: thats why they removed the soul ash cap a month or two ago
[3:44:01] Colt_Engineer: @towelliee you don't need to remake your leggos. upgrading them gives you a socket.
[3:44:02] Mathhbm: @Renzay83 no more, maybe is a bug but is giving less than half a level rn
[3:44:02] After43ver: i want bonus ash weekend
[3:44:03] stabzmcgeee: lets be honost recraft our leggos for a socket slot is like the least degen thing we would do
[3:44:04] chronoit: They could fix it . they simply are too heavy as a company to do it
[3:44:04] kroknows101: What's with all the cosmetic shoulders from torghast and Korthia? Hope they come out with more items, they don't seem to match any other pieces, color wise.
[3:44:08] LumLFM: people are gonna have plenty of soul ash. people asking for the base piece back don't realize no one's using that slow anymore lol
[3:44:16] smashwow: wait... they can't give us a refund system? hold up...

[3:44:28] fusionred1991: Sup Towelliee
[3:44:30] Felrane: Its like blizz rather then fix Torgast to make it rewarding just make a worse system to force us back into it
[3:44:32] DaBestGAround: But will you get the shards immediately to use the sockets?
[3:44:42] XadanarGaming: @Towelliee they should just make a Lego DE where you get your soul ash and stuff back... because you still need to buy the wrists from a vendor
[3:44:43] aminus: Got 3/8 dungeon teleports, now I’m gonna be the summon bot NotLikeThis

[3:44:58] trsn: New Torghast is pretty fun
[3:44:58] mavericks312: the new torghast is actually cool
[3:45:00] LumLFM: new torghies was fun with friends
[3:45:03] Poriand: torghast still sucks as a rogue
[3:45:10] Spathotan: New torghast is 5000% better than the original
[3:45:12] Unciatim: Love me some Choregash
[3:45:15] Aquadriel: @Towelliee thorgast shouldve been like islands, shit ton of pets, mounts, toys and transmogs.
[3:45:16] AveragePvp: ive always liked torghast but i main ele lol
[3:45:19] CritcobainTV: @Poriand I've NEVER had trouble with torghast as a rogue
[3:45:22] iblighters: it is a pain but that auto loot power is a god send
[3:45:25] filos0phia: besides the affixes, what was added to torghast?
[3:45:28] Felrane: fair enought
[3:45:29] Poriand: @Critcobain spec?
[3:45:29] montypythoon: @AveragePvp stormkeeper every 15sec amirite
[3:45:38] rusherrusher: im item level 185, what should i do for fastest gear?
[3:45:39] CritcobainTV: @Poriand I've done it as all of them, outlaw probably easiest tho
[3:45:45] Dropzone34: I havent done torghast yet was stuck with the lag trying to do all the story missions
[3:45:47] stabzmcgeee: its too late for most peeps tho,,, they already have the bad taste in thier mouth so they will always hate the tower
[3:45:49] AveragePvp: @zoltarek999 gg insta lmao
[3:45:50] xrandomdoodx: losing points because you forget to break a few vases feels kinda meh too lol
[3:45:51] Thagrius: hunter ele shaman got 5 stars easily both times as 2 man
[3:45:52] Poriand: @Critcobain im sub. ilvl 209
[3:45:54] chronoit: Torghast is still the worst most boring ass content that I'm required to do
[3:45:55] Araphas: They could have at least added cosmetic rewards from the beginning
[3:45:56] Kisswani: true , I blame you as well Kappa
[3:45:57] Heatinup: the auto loot in torghast is the best thing ever
[3:46:02] montypythoon: @AveragePvp then stack nature dmg Kreygasm
[3:46:04] xsp00n: I feel like Shadowlands, although not the best xpac, is building to be one of the best .3 patches of all time
[3:46:09] brian99000: I think they should be more transparent with how the scoring works personally
[3:46:10] mavericks312: careful saying the community is wrong isnt the popular vote lol
[3:46:12] smashwow: idk i still hate it.
[3:46:12] grokshar: community never wrong COPIUM
[3:46:13] montypythoon: AUTOLOOT Kreygasm
[3:46:13] After43ver: blizz is always right they just yield lol
[3:46:16] brian99000: like maybe a percentage bar as you go
[3:46:16] mraxeman: The great vault is already bad in its rewards and now they are locking off so many slots with domination and a legendary that vault loot is going to feel even worse
[3:46:17] othraerir: first one i picked :) autoloot
[3:46:20] Unciatim: Oh.. you forgot to kill that rat... your score drops from 5 to 4 stars
[3:46:24] ijuki: How do you unlock the box?
[3:46:27] ChimmyNeutron: @shac20 It won't have a .3 patch. Just .2
[3:46:28] montypythoon: the blessing are fucking op too
[3:46:29] CritcobainTV: @Poriand It's still not that bad, you smash bosses as sub, trash just takes a bit longer. Get a diff main hand and just smash it as outlaw
[3:46:31] BlueBeast33: I mean they literally did nothing to Twisting Corridors so I don't really care about Torghast still
[3:46:33] Thagrius: you get the greys too?
[3:46:40] ic3k0ld: timers are the worst thing in games unless it makes sense for that part of the story and not overplayed
[3:46:40] Kisswani: Pog
[3:46:41] Aquadriel: @Towelliee thorgast shouldve been like islands, shit ton of pets, mounts, toys and transmogs.

[3:46:47] AveragePvp: LOL
[3:46:50] Medina007: They just give us something worse so we would be glad when they give us back the usual crap
[3:46:55] D3mitr1: rip
[3:47:07] MistaHat: @Aquadriel i mean, you still used it for AP
[3:47:09] XadanarGaming: @Towelliee we werent wrong blizzard just had a terrible implementation of the system because it was rushed out. I enjoyed torghast the very first time i ran it but after that it was repetitive and boring. You cant call it a rogue like and have none of the features of a rogue like except for it being repetitive
[3:47:12] CritcobainTV: Server hasn't reset yet
[3:47:14] Renzay83: think the vault is still down
