[0:28:03] Sushi_Yumm: hi kitten
[0:28:05] iTzKraynos: @JtPacks knew it was gonna be liek that
[0:28:06] Lincoln5269: Hey Pika
[0:28:14] venomz_xd: sub rogue main tips for 2v2
[0:28:14] itsHomicydal: means theyre taking the community aspect out of wow and just making the game single player with NPC shit
[0:28:14] ParrotParfait: pika is an npc.
[0:28:16] tub000: it sucks
[0:28:21] hemm__: it’s like the comp stomp of dungeons but they’re on your team
[0:28:23] zarakiirl: yes plz
[0:28:24] hunter31753: none of them do dmg the healers suck and just brain dead
[0:28:29] anmusallam: not a good idea
[0:28:34] Pwnyo808: I need some ai healers for ss fast queues, the dream
[0:28:51] JtPacks: @iTzKraynos my mate and i queued as tank/healer for fun and they dont even use dragon riding in the dragon riding dungeon, they run into trash packs and run AWAY from the tank
[0:29:09] Pwnyo808: Just for the clim at like 1600-1700 cap

[0:29:32] suspicious94: pika have you tried out out a /cast crimson vial /cast vanish macro?  one press does both and you never waste a vial before you instantly reset with cdr , so technically could double vial
[0:29:36] Nvellen: Nvellen subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 55 months, currently on a 55 month streak! 55 jesus christ almighty were old
[0:29:39] valandurrr: @JtPacks feels pretty realistic imo
[0:29:50] suspicious94: why not!?
[0:30:00] hunter31753: what’s worse is if your not 70 and you do the npc dungeon, you don’t get the big xp at the end of the dungeon
[0:30:07] Pwnyo808: Plus that naturally pushes people higher too which might trickle up
[0:30:09] Raf3939: song?
[0:30:10] Ryso33: depends on what they train but they could train their models n shit over time to make crazy healers
[0:30:11] suspicious94: so much energy now so less of an issue
[0:30:13] Ryso33: yea exactly

[0:57:21] QuanticShift: some hard base about to drop soon
[0:57:27] Latch223: i played classic BC with a twitch staff guy, they are SUPER bloated staff wise and waste money constantly
[0:57:29] ZzawadazZ: echoing didnt get buffed. They changed it from arcane to physical and gave it 43% buff to account for armor bc its physical now
[0:57:29] Slaughterlot: they make money its just greedy pigs always want more and more, never enough
[0:57:47] Xenic0501: Hit a new PR in the gym today Pika, benched 275 for 9 reps. I'm catching up to your 405 Bench max
[0:57:57] two32am: no way thats it
[0:57:58] valandurrr: @Slaughterlot it's this
[0:58:03] dawnovun: I doubt it - it's Amazon being selfish. Lol
[0:58:05] ognolove: yo pika you think you’ll play any ww monk today? fun watching you play that sheeeit!
[0:58:10] alextumay: amazon owns the servers and twitch. twitch pays amazon so they can pretend they dont make any money and not pay out creators
[0:58:16] verothius: people dont realize how expensive it is to run a business lol
[0:58:22] Pwnyo808: I ain't stressing about twitch news man
[0:58:29] deebizness_: cause its a monopoly for free
[0:58:31] alextumay: its extremely profitable they just pretend its not
[0:58:32] ralvich: @xenic0501 275x9 is pretty damn good nice dude
[0:58:33] teqkerz: ye maybe
[0:58:37] Rabaraux: back to xfire
[0:58:41] WarlordKasper: tax write off for amazon
[0:58:42] Pwnyo808: From a business perspective, during clvid they hired a ton of people, ofc those.jobs get cut at some point t
[0:58:42] deebizness_: 2 billion on twitch with a 1.5 trillion worth
[0:58:43] QuanticShift: catJAM
[0:59:02] DrewPBallz18: Whats good pika
[0:59:07] two32am: they get a % of every sub no?
[0:59:10] floofirl: What is the cost of Twitch to run versus Amazon though?
[0:59:26] DrewPBallz18: are you gonna run echoing with the 43% buff
[0:59:26] Pwnyo808: Twitch is planning to expand so they're hiring for where they expect to be.  They keep hitting growth marks and they hire more.
[0:59:41] Xenic0501: @ralvich Thank you! I wanted 10 but hit that wall didn't bother going for the 10th
[1:00:24] chickyhands: also, a lot of major businesses are going to make sure they show losses for tax purposes.
[1:00:29] Ilovemycatx0x0: hate kai talentless
[1:00:33] Lacutis: twitch revenue in 2022 was $2.8B
[1:00:34] krazybaz: @Pwnyo808 they just ley off 500 employes recently and they closed server in South Koreo so no i dont think so
[1:00:38] Bo96ma: PLay with chan 2s
[1:00:43] DrewPBallz18: DrewPBallz18 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:01:02] Kroski: They also makes insane amounts of money already (kai, xqc, etc) so no biggie for them
[1:01:03] dawnovun: "Is Twitch as a company profitable? According to a Fortune report, the company had been unprofitable since the last nine years. The San Francisco-based company also announced last year that it will exit South Korea's market in February 2024"
[1:01:09] vmills: we will follow you to a different platform if needed. well unless it’s TikTok because I’m too old for that shit lol
[1:01:15] vonos: pika, u should do 3s with an alt rogue for viewer games and see how it goes lmao
[1:01:22] DrewPBallz18: if i wanted to que up with u do i need to be on tycondrius
[1:01:23] Pwnyo808: Also twitch will likely not ever get shut down realistically.  Amazon needs to keep the platform so their competition doesn't sneak in.  Twitch will be fine as long as Amazon is investing in their prime video.  Contracts not getting renewed literally just mean they're restructuring deals.  I don't think it really matters
[1:01:24] Ryso33: heard theyre trying to offload more onto user pcs when possible to cut costs like encoding or something but idk much
[1:01:25] vonos: would be kinda funny
[1:01:28] ryooikitenkai: whats good big bro
[1:01:42] ryooikitenkai: we poured up? pikabooSauce
[1:01:47] chikenjoe_: hello
[1:01:57] lencho32a: Pika!!! Get them dubs
[1:02:04] dawnovun: in before "Gotta take a shit"
[1:02:08] malkmaan: why does it say all my servers are incompatible when trying to login?
[1:02:10] SoniicFusion: what happened to the furniture
[1:02:27] anmusallam: where would you switch
[1:02:27] bradenschuh1: youtube streamer lol
[1:02:27] dawnovun: Twitch should just convert to porn and call it "Twat"
[1:02:29] gooooofy_: how much time did the maintenance take in NA
[1:02:35] Pwnyo808: Un-profitable for a business isn't always a good indicator of that businesses health.  If a company grows 20% in any given year their workforce needs to grow by 30% so they can capitalize on the momentum.
[1:02:40] vonos: If twitch shutdown, it would kind of be good if you think about it. There would be another streaming service that you would make more I feel like.
[1:02:46] vonos: It's like vine when that shut down, tiktok rose
[1:02:47] Pwnyo808: So they'd be "unprofitable".
[1:02:51] withthedraco: whats your favorite 2h t mog? congrats on the house bro! its the move! @Pikabooirl looking for a good t mog for my pally i fucking love your daggers rn

[2:48:32] overrrlord12: YO DUDE MY GLADIUS IS DOING TEH SAME THING HAHA
[2:48:40] steebet: @matt_caste so does the default pet attack (on the pet action bar) work for all pets, or should we made /petattack macros to get the army to shoot the right thing?
[2:49:00] tigys: OG Gladius hasn't been updated in like a year
[2:49:16] overrrlord12: @steebet the default works but its annoying u have to spam it sometimes
[2:49:18] thericebags: can still 4-2 this if u play well
[2:49:20] eli_sundayx: Did we already do 3's?
[2:49:24] matt_caste: @steebet I pet attack macro basically half my stuff because nothing is reliable, might be over compensating but at least I know where I'm sending em
[2:50:12] steebet: @overrrlord12 @matt_caste i feel like sometimes i want to be casting Hand of Guldan on one target (e.g. totem) and send my pets to chase my kill target - if they're out of range or whatever
[2:50:22] steebet: so macroing everything feels weird to me
[2:50:30] steebet: macroing petattack to everything i mean
[2:50:40] matt_caste: @steebet yeah I have some on and some off for that reason
[2:50:50] eygton: not gonna lie I think I like retail PvP more then wotlk
[2:51:06] steebet: i guess it's just about finding a balance that works

[2:51:20] dotsandpot: use curses
[2:51:23] dotsandpot: in downtime
