[1:00:47] ytligbrud: Ziqo bro its monkatos to exchange gold for a gifted sub with the viewers right ?

[1:01:21] vxy_21: gear check
[1:01:29] SippinSimpSyrup: @J0n_B they also buffed those abilities instead of improving frost, which was a horrendous decision
[1:01:43] Vir0n: clearcasting for heals dankRiot
[1:01:46] Dustin_beaver: Arent they buffing mage heals and frostfire bolt?
[1:01:48] SippinSimpSyrup: they just want mages to heal
[1:01:51] Genghish: No one knows the song?
[1:02:02] arieuh: make it possible with clearcast too plox
[1:02:14] SippinSimpSyrup: yes, they are buffing mage healing and abilities that support dmg and healing, but are not improving frost, lame

[1:03:09] protegidinho: is mage the best class in sod?

[1:05:42] layziep: ziqoPls
[1:05:58] SippinSimpSyrup: thats why its frustrating them to see buff healing and do nothing with frost. been a trash spec the enitre time.
[1:06:04] luzid7: they should buff frostfire bolt and spellforst bolt way more and brainfreeze should procc for 40%
[1:06:07] QwQGolden: AlienPls

[1:06:53] shelobelia: xD
[1:06:55] gambleragain: I love that the changes don't affect mage top DPS in PVE, but rogues can eat shit
[1:07:00] layziep: BrillHilda bleedPurple
[1:07:06] SippinSimpSyrup: the rune choices they made for frost were just bad
[1:07:17] luzid7: frost is already rly strong but only in duels its trash for bgs sadly
[1:07:20] SMYYYLE: how would a 1v1 go vs a equally skilled SP?

[1:09:09] remmixx: The worst thing about frost is that all 3 runes on boots are giga good for frost and they need to be on different items ...
[1:09:10] TheVaroon: "Blizzard decided...." makes it sound like they care
[1:09:16] varatupaj: warrlock rune are the worst, just random proc crit dodgde shit and shadowflame that does 10 dmg
[1:09:29] arieuh: instant pyro?
[1:09:30] Bushido288: they care more about their 20 dollars dreadlord set than actual gameplay
[1:09:33] arieuh: ahh hot streak?
[1:09:33] hiro25000: @varatupaj Sadowflame is a a troll
[1:09:35] arieuh: ofc
[1:09:40] aSteamedTomato: @varatupaj they're not worse than hunter runes.
[1:09:48] hiro25000: 5% chance proc
[1:09:51] hiro25000: garbage
[1:10:05] aSteamedTomato: hunter has some VERY good runes
[1:10:06] aSteamedTomato: what I mean
[1:10:06] Genghish: Hunter got best runes confirmed
[1:10:13] aSteamedTomato: is that they put 0 thought into most of the runes
[1:10:22] aSteamedTomato: and the runes that ARE good are also thoughtless
[1:10:25] Elensar748: chest is bad too
[1:10:38] Elensar748: its lion every build
[1:10:40] aSteamedTomato: we're not complaining about whether or not runes are making us strong. we're complaining about the runes being extremely unfun for the most part.
[1:10:46] aSteamedTomato: and lion competing with important runes
[1:11:01] aSteamedTomato: it's just very poor design. They don't have a hunter player in their team, I'm like 99% sure
[1:11:29] calippoHEHEJO: lol, they dont have anyone playing the game at all in their team Kappa
[1:11:38] x_jdot: i guess they stil have 2 or 3 phases to get it right lol
[1:11:38] hiro25000: @aSteamedTomato Warlocks only had passives in phase 2
[1:11:44] xuukiii: they have ret player in the team and it's still shit so whatever KEKW
[1:12:10] aSteamedTomato: @hiro25000 we got actives that shoehorned us into a 1-button playstyle.
[1:12:13] x_jdot: helm and shoulder to me seem like they should be powerful runes
[1:12:16] aSteamedTomato: the glove runes are great
[1:12:20] yoshimitzu54: warrior runes are unfun
[1:12:21] kirk_hunts: I play hunter/mage as basically both my mains and I think they're both in weird places that I don't want them to be.
[1:12:29] arieuh: hunters rune are insane
[1:12:45] aSteamedTomato: now they buff ranged hunter in the worst possible way. It's going to be a menace in PvP
[1:12:47] joeychrist315: lol viper was so stupid to add
[1:12:53] joeychrist315: makes int irrelevant
[1:12:58] x_jdot: right, until they buff it
[1:13:06] anheroes: invigoration rune too
[1:13:08] aSteamedTomato: viper is completely broken
[1:13:14] ggbr0sky: beside in raid maybe if other one have lion?
[1:13:16] letsgetgoingyo: Master marksman is better for damage if you have a 2nd hunter providing Lion
[1:13:18] aSteamedTomato: and invalidates any mana-related rune
[1:13:19] juchaz: I wouldnt play hunter in sod without viper
[1:13:19] weyw0t: hunter is the king of dead runes
[1:13:24] celestius11: i never understood making trash talents / gear / skills in games
[1:13:25] joeychrist315: yea invigoration rune for mana too smh
[1:13:32] SippinSimpSyrup: frost is the worst pve spec in the game and also trash in pvp
[1:13:33] celestius11: but developers do it all the time
[1:13:34] DrMaggz: Viper would be fine if it didn't give all your mana back by looking at something
[1:13:38] layziep: ziqoJAM
[1:13:44] Fogged: living flame KEKW
[1:13:52] aSteamedTomato: @letsgetgoingyo by 10 dps, ye. Now a second hunter will be running marksman, though, so the melee BM will always be running lion, and the ranged hunter will always be running Lone Wolf
[1:13:57] shogun2022: I feel like I missed the  memo on SoD, why is everyone loving it so much
[1:14:08] TheVaroon: I think they went wayyyyy over the top with the amount of new stuff. It just closes the gap with retail by this point.
[1:14:20] anheroes: useless boot rune
[1:14:25] joeychrist315: invigoration run is mana regen
[1:14:27] johnnypoison69: @shogun2022 classic with more fleshed out classes and busted abilities, new pve/pvp content
[1:14:32] aSteamedTomato: no, BM is too strong
[1:14:33] aSteamedTomato: post-nerf
[1:14:37] throssome: @TheVaroon then don't play it
[1:14:39] aSteamedTomato: so Lone wolf isn't a thing for melee anymore
[1:14:49] shogun2022: seems almost gimicky I guess im cynical retail "andy"
[1:14:50] letsgetgoingyo: Lone wolf is not good, we play BM lion or BM master marksman (if 2nd hunt)
[1:15:00] TheVaroon: @throssome I don't
[1:15:09] johnnypoison69: @shogun2022 also the fact that there is a living, breathing world
[1:15:18] shogun2022: hmm now that is cool
[1:15:18] edror: what is the song?
[1:15:31] insanic_3: i feel like they got hte point of classic plus but missed the execution on it. Im waiting to see if 60 is better though
[1:15:34] throssome: @TheVaroon oh you just wanted to share your opinion on something you don't play. got it.
[1:15:38] JUMJUMnoMi: @aSteamedTomato MM is way better once I consistently beat my pet in dmg on all bosses it meant I doubled down on my crits value
[1:15:43] Drtydeeds: Lightmode ahhh
[1:15:48] targon_innos: light mode WutFace
[1:15:54] shogun2022: it burns
[1:15:55] supliikki: what is this flashbang
[1:16:14] SippinSimpSyrup: you can healin during channel?
[1:16:16] JUMJUMnoMi: but Lonewolf is not justified yet in my case I dont do enough dmg to cover the pet dmg loss on bosses 3-6 even tho Lonewolf on the 1st 2 bosses I focus way more the boss
[1:16:17] remmixx: heal while casting wtf
[1:16:21] aSteamedTomato: @JUMJUMnoMi sims are very accurate now (we've been trawling logs for weeks to compare), and sim says +10 dps from MM, because you get so much value from the extra stats from lion.
[1:16:28] Fogged: wtf
[1:16:29] Fogged: LMFAO
[1:16:29] 69katty: wait wtf happend
[1:16:30] sending123: i didnt
[1:16:30] myjedak: What a pog song
[1:16:33] sending123: wtf
[1:16:34] x_jdot: i didnt see
[1:16:34] skaran27x: do what
[1:16:34] Drtydeeds: show again
[1:16:36] Netphics: wtf just happened
[1:16:44] edror: what is the sooonnng??
[1:16:51] kirk_hunts: I'm not fully understanding what I'm seeing
[1:16:54] JUMJUMnoMi: the fight 3 to 6 are way to mobile for me to cover enough dmg, when my pet is consistently contributing while I the player has to run around mechanics
[1:16:57] TheVaroon: @throssome correct. I've played through phase 1 and it felt waste of time fun server.
[1:17:06] luzid7: lol
[1:17:07] sending123: hahahaha
[1:17:08] SippinSimpSyrup: bruuuuh
[1:17:08] teachzin: LUL

[1:17:22] Muffufu: good to know
[1:17:25] remmixx: ybe working as intended ?ma
[1:17:28] sending123: dont clip
[1:17:30] Vir0n: you can do it while channeling it says so on wowhead
[1:17:31] sending123: nothing happened
[1:17:34] DrMaggz: Can you charge it while channeling too?
[1:17:34] hiro25000: can you use it when you cast a fireball?
[1:17:34] Dalbo420: YOU CAN DO THAT?
[1:17:38] sending123: everything is fine
[1:17:41] aSteamedTomato: but ye, the BIGGEST evidence we have that they really don't understand what they're doing with hunters is that WE'RE PLAYING SPELLPOWER HUNTER NOW
[1:17:41] jeppekaha: @Ziqoftw If you use crono on party members that is in combat, you dont go in combat. And can drink right away :)
[1:17:43] biingb0ng: Whats going on?
[1:17:43] SippinSimpSyrup: @Ziqoftw try during fireball
[1:17:51] Fogged: @jeppekaha i thought they fixed this
[1:17:56] JUMJUMnoMi: @aSteamedTomato yes I really think MM is better and not enough people try it and focus on staying still with Sniper Training, I loose all my biggest dps on the fights I have to move
[1:18:00] Vetto_7: banger pepeJAMJAMJAM
[1:18:03] JUMJUMnoMi: move too much**

[1:18:49] teachzin: ignite ticking 900 LUL
[1:18:50] targon_innos: 1k ignite means u crit him for 5k
[1:18:51] SippinSimpSyrup: @Ziqoftw chrono only worksing with missiles, doesnt work with an actual cast like fireball or scorch
[1:18:53] jbakelimitless: definitely not bugged
[1:18:53] luzid7: just don't use other spells ^^
[1:18:54] shogun2022: I think both ticks hit for 900

[1:19:32] Muffufu: Wouldn't you be able to fire plast in Arcane Missiles too then, if the reasoning is instant?
[1:19:32] Vir0n: on wowhead it indicates that you can cast it while channeling
[1:19:34] dobutsuuu: can you show talents¿?

[1:20:15] trubius: Happy Birthday Ziqo!
[1:20:21] 69katty: did it maybe have something to do with the fact that your combust was 6x stacked prior to the duel?
[1:20:24] joeychrist315: nerf mage

[1:21:14] brakealot: name of this old banger please ?
[1:21:21] the_broxton: did ignite crit?
[1:21:25] x_jdot: it seemed like the pyro got mostly abaorbed so maybe it had something to do with that
[1:21:30] x_jdot: absorbed

[1:47:51] christiangodwarrior97: he meant to say ur gonna troll at stanley for 15 levels

[1:48:28] Shek_shas: what is sf ?
[1:48:30] RunicTitan: I have zero hype to play any form of Hardcore atm personally. Takes way too long to level for the risk to be worth it for me.
[1:48:35] gloneiric: right?? did u see bean freaking out over it lol
[1:48:43] vepsee: why does it matter if its a fresh server or not if its ssf
[1:48:47] the_broxton: its ironman from runescape
[1:48:52] Sleepylol93: The realms are so empty, dosent really matter if its SF or normal hc
[1:48:53] Ser_Khan: at 60 you lose the SF status right
[1:48:54] johnnypoison69: no trading, no AH, no mail

[1:49:21] Feuerbuechse: fire is allways Casino
[1:49:27] RunicTitan: @christiangodwarrior97 I've done that enough to the point where it is no longer fun though.
[1:49:35] Ser_Khan: oh its forever SSF then? I thought you could trade once you hit 60
[1:49:50] Sleepylol93: The realms are so empty, dosent really matter if its SF or normal hc NotLikeThis

[1:50:32] Vetto_7: KEKL
[1:50:35] robbiestacks: @sleepylol93 sf is a solo game style who cares about realm pop lol
[1:50:35] Fogged: the melee neck is so broken lol

[1:51:15] SippinSimpSyrup: yeah, caster neck from last phase
[1:51:15] Fogged: the thing is too
[1:51:19] Seoken1: For hunter the Gnomer neck is liteerally 1.7 DPS (total, not %) better than the pvp neck, I ran the sims earlier today
[1:51:23] TrebekTv: piston is piss
[1:51:23] Fogged: the melee neck has caster crit too
[1:51:24] SippinSimpSyrup: caster neck from p1
[1:51:25] Fogged: its almost better
[1:51:26] ArkoM8: KEKW
[1:51:30] Fogged: LMAO
[1:51:33] SippinSimpSyrup: LITERALLY, i was thinking that the other day
[1:51:37] Mcgeezax90: more like Mark of Fordring
[1:51:41] rollinsthechamp: Piston Pendant better imo
[1:51:51] SippinSimpSyrup: something from sm gy is comparable to gnomer gear???
[1:51:56] lasenh: u need spirit for out of combat regen set
[1:51:57] SippinSimpSyrup: so wack lol
[1:52:16] TrebekTv: the epic rings ok i guess right?
[1:52:23] kb_h: SoD power creep making classic items irrelevant even without an expansion, who could have predicted this?
[1:52:25] Tiebot87: @Ziqoftw is AWC today?
[1:52:28] TrebekTv: awh shit lol
[1:52:35] papismaekmyazz: NOBOOBA
[1:52:37] bluff1n: LUL
[1:52:40] certtifiedg: EVERYTHING
[1:52:44] ArkoM8: LUL
[1:52:48] OlleverTV: Yea the AP neck will prolly best best in slot in lvl 50 too
[1:52:49] NericoTV: melee ring is just wsg ring what do you mean
[1:52:53] Ser_Khan: I hate the powercreep in SoD, feels like we're playing TBC already
[1:53:05] wreckstormx: and casters still top dps LUL
[1:53:06] letsgetgoingyo: casters too stronk already, dont need OP gear
[1:53:07] SmashTheDude: casters have a good life via their scaling imo
[1:53:11] hystelios: @OlleverTV People said that about last phase they will most likely make better stuff
[1:53:21] bluff1n: melee devs ofc
[1:53:22] shaggy462: why the gnomer WB doesnt increase AP is a bit odd
[1:53:27] Fogged: 100% agreed, itemization is wack
[1:53:34] Sgravoboy: are we really complaining about caster items in this moment?
[1:53:39] F1shy3: until naxx
[1:53:41] N3x3z: naxx
[1:53:43] millinoid: until naxx or AQ40
[1:53:44] x_jdot: forever lmao

[1:53:45] Sgravoboy: in which there is absolute caster dominance in every aspect?
[1:53:47] juchaz: but we still get clapped by casters Sadge
[1:53:54] TrebekTv: depends if horde or alliance
[1:53:55] bluff1n: its insane
[1:53:58] snaildwn: qsr is pretty crazy lmao
[1:54:00] PizzzaDog: yea i remember still wanting that ring around phase 4
[1:54:04] TrebekTv: with kings and the bwl ring right
[1:54:05] chr47: How is gnomer ring comparable to qsr?
[1:54:11] Bamsemarta: happy bday :D
[1:54:23] conceitedxo: Meele neck > caster neck for mage
[1:54:34] prodigy_wow: the 40 gnomer ring is very close to Myrmidon's Signet, level 53 epic
[1:54:34] Gavells: Blood Moon rewards are such bs as well, all casters just gets rings, melee get weapons??
[1:54:41] wreckstormx: u have the same hp as my ret pal
[1:54:54] snaildwn: nah similar strength and stam, lose agi but gain 1% crit and 30 ap... qsr is much much better
[1:55:10] Shyne_420: !server

[1:57:04] hystelios: I got the other one KEKW i trolled
[1:57:22] CwoodAGG21: is your  name from austin powers? Numbertwo
[1:57:23] prodigy_wow: 1% crit on items is kinda scuffed, they should have done crit rating like in TBC perhaps

[2:06:35] Skyle_win: how hard would you say it is for current arcane mages to get glad? with deflation etc
[2:06:41] luzid7: they would balance the game then for 1v1
[2:06:47] kusoneko: need dueling area to reset cds between each duel
[2:06:49] Gadeesh: @shady2562 yessss!!
[2:06:52] Pepzsi: hell yeah
[2:06:59] hiro25000: They should do 1v1 lobby
[2:07:00] Pepzsi: spread the truth
[2:07:01] Clewur: they're neglecting everything retail pvp related
[2:07:07] cropdeq: should be a neutral zone so u can duel ally
[2:07:13] hiro25000: YES
[2:07:13] IgNaTiUs847: layers on classic are horizontal not vertical as retail
[2:07:15] letsgetgoingyo: They said they have to layer the whole world at a time
[2:07:19] Vir0n: add 1v1 arena
[2:07:23] shady2562: @gadeesh it will be again comedy of reactions because Pshero is too cold :)
[2:07:32] gia__: layers are shared across zones to avoid being layered when you walk from a zone to another
[2:07:32] trimaz__: waiting 10 min for prep as rogue ResidentSleeper
[2:07:40] stormyweatherr: spam duelling with cd resets is so fun, best part about pservers

[2:09:28] luzid7: yeah but the y would balance it for 1v1 then
[2:09:49] shady2562: @ziqoftw I hated to see you lose in the finals of this duel tournament against Snutz. It was so bad to watch against lock like no chances.
[2:09:54] snekkn1: a rated bracket where you duel strictly your own class would be cool x)
[2:10:00] SippinSimpSyrup: @luzid7 they should balance it any way...
[2:10:00] wackpoetic: Shame? you see he is play warlock

[2:11:04] letsgetgoingyo: like you launched the explo trap behind him
[2:11:06] hiro25000: impossible to get it off in this meta
[2:11:13] SippinSimpSyrup: idk why people dont play succ with chaos bolt
[2:11:13] prodigy_wow: need succubus if you play chaos
[2:11:21] SippinSimpSyrup: do locks not have succ yet?
[2:11:27] prodigy_wow: They do

[2:12:53] iMeRrcy: wyvern sting is stronger then serpent
[2:12:56] spacecowboyr: its more powerful it ticks way harder
[2:12:59] iMeRrcy: chim will refresh it
[2:12:59] Pinzly: did you swap some gear?
[2:12:59] kirk_hunts: YOu can only have 1 sting on
[2:13:00] spacecowboyr: so serpent won't remove it
[2:13:01] kirk_hunts: you want wyvern
[2:13:04] adardrae: working as intended
[2:13:07] flyingsquirreloo: you cant
[2:13:09] enigmasvea: its how classic works
[2:13:11] spacecowboyr: chimera won't refresh anymore
[2:13:17] kirk_hunts: wyvern smacks way harder
[2:13:17] Bromorin: Wyvern > serpent no?
[2:13:18] thamysticog: i think because a more powerful spell is already active 4Head
[2:13:24] lazeeqt94: cause wyvern is best
[2:13:36] Ryett: Whywould you want a ess powerful spell? Blizzard wants to know
[2:13:38] padierman: They both do damage, i guess thats kind of it
[2:13:39] iMeRrcy: theyre the same dot but wyvren is stronger
[2:13:39] TheVaroon: cause both are dots and one is stronger dot than the other
[2:13:40] kirk_hunts: BEcause wyvern is a poison and it's better than serpent
[2:13:40] enigmasvea: its like when you try to reshield ice barrier and it says "a more powerful spell is active"
[2:13:42] spacecowboyr: na it's been like that all of SoD
[2:13:50] kirk_hunts: yes
[2:13:51] lazeeqt94: yes

[2:14:12] hystelios: Oh shit NOTED
[2:14:20] Yolaa27: he donates some totems
[2:14:22] Hieho: can you wyvern -> scorpid -> serpent it?
[2:14:24] gia__: you can probably scorpid and then viper I guess
[2:14:29] TheVaroon: any spells with same damage type will always prio the stronger over the weaker
[2:14:30] Hieho: oh I guess he just did
[2:14:34] arcane0mage: when i was younggg the flavor is strong i missed os long now tn tn
[2:14:36] kirk_hunts: it's the same thing as like having a mage cast a higher rank arcane intelect on you and then you trying to cast a lower rank one on yourself.
[2:14:39] enigmasvea: its like when you try to refresh ice barrier and it says "a more powerful spell is active"
[2:14:41] spacecowboyr: @Hieho you could but thats a waste of globals tbh
[2:15:04] DigitalDagor: found you on youtube. You're video about the pug gnomer you made was fantastic. Esp the last minute pettiness.
[2:15:04] Hieho: @spacecowboyr yea was thinking the same, doesn't sound like it's worth it
[2:15:21] millinoid: anyone got the milkman pasta KEKZ
[2:15:54] TheVaroon: @Ziqoftw try wyvern > scorpid > serpent should work
[2:16:05] gia__: yea scorpid or viper
