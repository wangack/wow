[4:39:55] Zaisx: unless no healer comp and you aug + 3 DPS
[4:40:07] oneshotelitee: I have a feeling we wil be seeing some brand new shit like a double ret for example 😂
[4:40:07] Pariahqt: triple UH DK with leggo
[4:40:09] zwappes: boomie garbage ICANT does the same thing unholy does but has ST ICANT
[4:40:11] Neotahl: If we see aug group vs 3 dps we can see how worth it actually is live
[4:40:14] Triplehelixqt: sub is good for mdi key range
[4:40:18] Bu_Remie: prob outlaw rogue, havoc sh, fire mage, mw, and vdh.
[4:40:21] deanw0w69: @oneshotelitee i just tank shitlow keys for guildies, i prefer soulcrush and even no sb over cheat
[4:40:24] klapp_: Think we will see VDH tank and monk healer allot but what do I know
[4:40:28] deanw0w69: outlaw rogue in mdi ICANT

[4:40:52] Wikedlyrics: target cap spec in MDI this chat on some shit
[4:40:53] deanw0w69: @mrpersoninchat its 8 with talent RAGEY
[4:40:55] UnlimitedBytes: I would say VDH 100% (cause most dps except brew which no one plays sadge), Monk/Druid Heal (cause Druid is insane DMG and Monk big heals)
[4:40:59] mrpersoninchat: @deanw0w69 mb mb
[4:40:59] UnlimitedBytes: DPS not sure tho
[4:41:00] hdott52: yeah also 3 min classes are tough for MDI no?

[4:41:29] Geckoos: rogue + dh + mage + priest + vdh
[4:41:35] rtsablebaine: BegWan BegWan BegWan
[4:41:44] LsWRLD420: vdh dk retpal fmage and disc heals prolly mdi comp hah
[4:41:48] chickennuggetreloaded: Do you think if it was TGP Paladin would get more play in the high keys?
[4:41:51] flahhoz: probably still havoc/warlock/mage for dmg?
[4:42:02] yujik46: @Geckoos u forgot uh dk
[4:42:14] LsWRLD420: dk repaceable with rouge
[4:42:15] deanw0w69: question is, do we need all the control a vdh brings? i only saw the dmg of tank pala and vdh

[4:42:40] too_Paradox: firstGarf
[4:42:44] UnlimitedBytes: @Samurayny Hard to say Havoc is doing masisve dmg but ret too, shadow can be viable if you need PI target and prio, however unholy dk strong in massive pulls, fire mage for prio and big aoe too
[4:42:44] mrpersoninchat: if both druids bad then maybe vdh resto, mage disc UH

[5:58:18] LsWRLD420: this mythic?
[5:58:20] chukudu: why is Dorkibear is played as Feral or Boomkin and Porkihavoc is more often played as Vengeance ? Susge

[5:59:30] DutchGameLab: streamer is just better

[5:59:56] petipeter12: feral is hidden op
[6:00:15] SL_Nerf_Herder: everything
[6:00:17] yeyanow: I didn't like freehold either
[6:00:30] jenkinsdonuttv: Jokes aside there's quite a few buffs methinks
[6:00:47] jenkinsdonuttv: @yeyanow You're under arrest for BFA slander
[6:00:48] DutchGameLab: Naraaxus xdd
[6:00:48] Cruzerthebruzer: freehold is ok, the bosses are ass though, imagine if hpal wasn't meta on 2nd boss
[6:00:54] Cruzerthebruzer: that shit would be the worst m+ boss ever
[6:01:05] yeyanow: It's just the only key my group wanted to run.. so I ran it like 60 times
[6:01:09] jenkinsdonuttv: Freehold music catJAM
[6:01:11] Cruzerthebruzer: they should've kept sea spout kickable I think
[6:01:18] Cruzerthebruzer: that was kickable right
[6:01:19] SL_Nerf_Herder: barrel boss is the worst.
[6:01:43] prugar: sea sprout never was, pretty sure
[6:01:44] thatleighguy: Hey Dorki would you ever get on board with a version of m+ that uses the torghast tile set generation for week to week variation instead of affixes?
[6:01:53] voldeekay: barrel boss without freedom was annoying
[6:02:00] jenkinsdonuttv: Was kickable in BFA
[6:02:15] Daylia1961: Hi all

[6:02:19] Bigdamx: do u play lunar in st?
[6:02:26] thatleighguy: They did it for torghast though
[6:02:35] LsWRLD420: or the buff system just with harder mobs
[6:02:54] hydr0h: Is this mythic?
[6:03:03] LsWRLD420: yeah im pretty sure
[6:03:03] jenkinsdonuttv: @thatleighguy Would require more work for m+, but they could do it for sure methinks
[6:03:36] jenkinsdonuttv: @thatleighguy But it would have to be varied, but also somewhat consistent since it's power-related
[6:03:44] thatleighguy: @jenkinsdonuttv yeah man I think it's doable, would allow the dungeons to be designed as dungeons but then a "torghast" style version for m+
[6:03:52] juno_sha: 4% Looking

[6:21:37] Samy_igou: it said on roadmap: revisit DF dungs
[6:21:39] Samy_igou: thats why
[6:21:42] i_cassius: Didnt they say in the raodmap its a return to the DF dungs ?

[6:22:55] cheetoenail: Clueless
[6:22:56] Garzag_: boon was s1 trinket yea?
[6:23:03] zombiown: Tbh i rather have 12 dungeons per season but repeated , like mechagon every season , it's just better than most other dungeons
[6:23:10] angrykhoifish: who's that 2.5% feral ST buff going?
[6:23:19] dango0n: I never got grieftorch in s1
[6:23:22] cheetoenail: aug bleed dispell on bird boss in academy hooly
[6:23:44] vellocets: @cheetoenail you ran pres evoker in s1 anyway, and they have caut as well
[6:23:45] angrykhoifish: That's how much some of the feral discord people estimated for ST
[6:24:29] Ckraigfriend: are you doing a full reclear raid everyweek??
[6:24:30] dango0n: Now that I think about it. All of the dungeons that were ass this expansion were returning dungeons
[6:24:33] toastbam: okay what if, they brough every dungeon back
[6:24:39] Hoshma46: next dungeon set will be upper and lower of all 4 mega dungeons xdd
[6:24:49] yeyanow: 12 is alot to remember
[6:24:50] Valtin: bring back legion 13 dungeons lol
[6:25:02] deepcalm: i wish they would do some real old dungeons like from WOTLK. the beta/gamma versions of them in classic wrath were fun tbh
[6:25:13] cursekwt: d
[6:25:16] EmmaZen: Where are all the 27-28 keys AAAA
[6:25:23] cursekwt: why u don't bother with fyrak?
[6:25:24] juno_sha: Where are all the 27-28 keys AAAA
[6:25:30] Ckraigfriend: maybe with the PIRATE PATCH they will bring some new dung for m plus old one reworked
[6:26:06] i_cassius: @Ckraigfriend GARRR!!
[6:26:10] Hoshma46: corrupted seeds are psychotic
[6:26:13] juno_sha: Why did i get 80% of all the afflicted as blood DK Madge
[6:26:15] njokkio: Folks with experience with tournament realm, if I want crafted gear do I just have to boost the profession and craft It myself?
[6:26:32] Morayeden: More SBG old dungeons awaree
[6:26:35] Staymortal: wailing caverns m+
[6:26:43] AtriseOW: Dire maul M+ lets go
[6:26:44] Yuudachi_Poinu: Deadmines M+
[6:26:47] s_surrender: Do you want to play shadowlands dungeons?
[6:26:48] Morayeden: Get rid of these boomer dungeons
[6:26:51] AtriseOW: actually SFK i think would be epic
[6:26:54] nezo_pont: Deadmines on M30+ would slap
[6:26:58] zachl_: YES
[6:27:00] Staymortal: @Yuudachi_Poinu would have like 1 hour timer
[6:27:05] pl0de: Cmon... chill mists
[6:27:06] LordAnomandaris: Nope
[6:27:06] juno_sha: Theater of Pain Pog

[6:27:15] toastbam: leave
[6:27:15] flickflackoverduck69: halls of atonement was bis
[6:27:29] greatangelsanguinius: I have returned from the banned realm
[6:27:29] AtriseOW: Do i want to be reminded about phial farm in Plague
[6:27:43] i_cassius: @i_cassius xdd
[6:27:58] juno_sha: Don't start wars. post ascii dicks
[6:27:59] fruitcake893: dos but make it so that you run fast out of combat
[6:28:01] juno_sha: dicki
[6:28:02] Dcss97: was this the guy who made the weiner or something?
[6:28:08] Yuudachi_Poinu: Skyreach M+

[6:28:15] toastbam: gambit was bis

[6:28:21] TwicksTV: nice chill everbloom
[6:28:30] Dcss97: nice chill alt f4 :)
[6:28:34] TwicksTV: its the most fun one tho
[6:28:36] klondike_wow: nice chill bolster EB Aware
[6:28:39] TwicksTV: its called an everbloom session for a reason
[6:28:42] TwicksTV: bloom sesh
[6:28:52] jessebona: Do you think Everbloom is the hardest one now Rise has been nerfed?
[6:28:57] s_surrender: Whats about kyrian weapons/nf stuff etc in shadowlands dungeons now when we haven't got covenants
[6:29:05] greatangelsanguinius: rise is horrible
[6:29:30] rony166: die on 3th almost and break key on last in everbloom 😁
[6:29:43] AtriseOW: Remember all the fun times in mists
[6:29:51] njokkio: Squid-shaman in tott still scares the shit out of me
[6:30:00] Staymortal: zul'farrrak would be a fire m+
[6:30:00] Ckraigfriend: they should make a path to each boss easy so you can pull them 1st without trash to them
[6:30:07] i_cassius: @AtriseOW Maze fun
[6:30:08] nezo_pont: I think hardest mechanic in all of this rotation is to dodge the rock balls in blackrook xdd
[6:30:11] jessebona: As a tank my problem with Everbloom has always been trying to pull large enough to time it. Affixes like bolstering, bursting and sanguine just make it worse. Hate the place.
[6:30:11] greatangelsanguinius: mists maze early pugs was lit
[6:30:13] Yuudachi_Poinu: @njokkio I don't find him to bad as a prot pally.
[6:30:25] AtriseOW: @i_cassius Or locks who ailed portal skip kek
[6:30:35] dango0n: Anyone miss temple of the Jade serpent?
[6:30:35] deepcalm: i find squid boi in tott to be the easiest boss in there
[6:30:43] norkibit: Yalnu is easy though, no?
[6:30:49] bolash0116: you east coast or west bro?
[6:31:03] greatangelsanguinius: what’s this drops toy?
[6:31:03] eijisenpai: did you like venthyr boomy dorki ?
[6:31:07] sskkskks: everbloom has to be the best dungeon theyve ever made because there are so many mechanics in there that makes me want to kill myself yet somehow i still enjoy the place
[6:31:19] Xastin3: im honestly having less fun with game cause its getting impossible to find groups
[6:31:32] Aggroboy: gawd i hated cocaine bear
[6:31:35] Xastin3: cant gear alts and struggle push keys
[6:31:45] Samy_igou: as a tank; sanguine is the worst affix to deal with, the stacks you get from autos slows you so you can't move the packs easly
[6:31:48] secretgmr26: thanks for the toy!
[6:31:49] Samy_igou: in EB
[6:31:54] Xastin3: cause people only want 485
[6:32:01] greatangelsanguinius: everbloom is sick asf in lower keys for pumping meters but gets so hard at a certain point
[6:32:06] Patrikhg: gearing a dps is really bad solo
[6:32:10] goop: yo whats ur raid doing why are u here
[6:32:22] Patrikhg: tank and healer is free atleast
[6:32:26] Xastin3: gearing a dps is amazingly terrible.
[6:32:32] greatangelsanguinius: wow
[6:32:34] goop: WTF
[6:32:49] Aggroboy: goodp
[6:32:50] Xastin3: no one will invite you to group unless your 285 doesnt matter your rating
[6:32:56] Xastin3: 485*
[6:33:06] greatangelsanguinius: what do these buyers actually want from the raid? surely its not gear
[6:33:09] Aggroboy: DPS zero to KSH is aids
[6:33:17] Xastin3: and no one joins cause there no tank
[6:33:24] angrykhoifish: Lol which DPS is he doing? because Havoc is a lot easier than Warrior
[6:33:36] njokkio: I mean afflicted week as a non-dispel dps is impossible to pug
[6:33:39] Zaleratv: confirmed only streamers push keys
[6:33:40] Patrikhg: they just need solo queue for 20s and lower
[6:33:40] greatangelsanguinius: warrior is actually decent don’t listen to the hate
[6:33:47] Aggroboy: Tank is already pretty friendly this season
[6:33:51] Xastin3: healer already doesnt do anything in keys
[6:33:58] LordAnomandaris: Perhaps they can add some affixes for dps for once
[6:34:02] greatangelsanguinius: although my 477 havoc gaps my warrior
[6:34:07] LordAnomandaris: Every week feels like healer week
[6:34:10] angrykhoifish: I think the things they've done this expac with healers has actively made it worse and stupider.
[6:34:10] nezo_pont: Idk it takes like 20 mins to find a normal group, but it's like 5 mins to make my own
[6:34:14] Xastin3: honestly they need increase player HP across board and make healing and dps matter
[6:34:20] yeyanow: I'll heal
[6:34:23] cheetoenail: @Aggroboy much more tank busters than last season
[6:34:23] Xastin3: increasing player hp by large amount would fix it
[6:34:24] greatangelsanguinius: monk healing feels good
[6:34:33] Xastin3: so there way less 1shots
[6:34:35] greatangelsanguinius: disc feels like you can’t recover easy
[6:34:36] j0hnnnny_: @xastin3 Have you played healer this season?
[6:34:42] Phredi1: can you link the riding wa mate?
[6:34:43] Xastin3: i main healer
[6:34:43] jessebona: I don't blame any heals/tank for not wanting to do keys. Past a certain level it's just miserable and everything rides on you doing it right.
[6:34:46] Xastin3: i play rdruid
[6:34:48] DasAutoChat: make absorbs on mobs LUL
[6:34:49] Garzag_: no its a priest affix :)
[6:34:50] Morayeden: Thing from beyond corruption thing could be like a dps affix @dorki
[6:34:55] DasAutoChat: Keepo
[6:34:56] yctnm: enemies periodically regen health if you dont meet a dps check
[6:34:59] Xastin3: im trying to play ret pally cause of buffs as alt and its misserable
[6:34:59] daddyissalty: affix you can only target if you are a dps
[6:35:00] toastbam: they just need to remove the tank and the healer titles, and just make dungeons and raids all dps
[6:35:01] yctnm: then mortal strike is relevant
[6:35:02] brainrot_behavior: tank affix xdd
[6:35:05] Patrikhg: well we could have "explosive" orbs with more health that buffs the party when u kill them
[6:35:15] Aggroboy: dunno about healer shortage, i played multiple healer up to KSH this season and get tons of rejections
[6:35:17] njokkio: They tried making explosive a dps affix and everyone hated it
[6:35:18] Samy_igou: something like incorp where dps have to kill them instead of cc mmyb
[6:35:18] BlackSnake100: lol explosive was suppose to be one as well but always ended up being a healer affix
[6:35:19] LordAnomandaris: Don't kill a mob in time then the raid gets a haste debuff. Like afflicted but you damage instead of healing
[6:35:24] XaelXXI: They should add an affix that insta kills the entire party and send them to the shadow realm. Once there you have to fight in a gauntlet to the death. If you die in the gaunlet, your key is bricked.
[6:35:26] Ckraigfriend: explosive hhahaa
[6:35:29] m_dep: You coudl give the actual mobs a shield thats actually a THICC shield
[6:35:35] eijisenpai: dorki how did you feel about the seasonal affix removed wasnt it more fun to play with ?
[6:35:36] m_dep: so it incentivizes high dam not just target switching
[6:35:38] Morayeden: The giant corruption circle was kinda a dps affix too
[6:35:43] itsblaine: You make a mob spawn that if you dont KILL it within a certain time you get a damage reduction
[6:35:44] Hoshma46: time to edge? HUH
[6:35:46] Morayeden: It was personal responsibility
[6:35:56] deepcalm: an affix where dps gets an add that only they can see that they have to kill or CC before it reduces their primary stat by 100% for 30 seconds
[6:36:06] Xastin3: affix's need to be removed and they need just make bosses do regular fight mechanics interesting. make it so classes have to be efficient doing damage and make relevent non 1shot healing
[6:36:11] Nightbot: dorkiHey Join my Discord server! https://discord.gg/yHFTAZn
[6:36:11] Xastin3: with rot damage
[6:36:23] minetherr: MyAvatar
[6:36:25] Xastin3: incrase player stamina
[6:36:27] jessebona: @deepcalm Isn't that just the DH talent they all hated and Blizzard removed?
[6:36:40] daddyissalty: just make it so only dps can target the affix. what is dose doesn't matter right  now xD
[6:36:51] Morayeden: Necrotic was for sure a group afix
[6:37:03] Nightbot: dorkiCheer Subscribe to my YouTube channel! @ https://www.youtube.com/c/Dorki
[6:37:09] Xastin3: i mean it was team game but its misserable joining guilds in this game
[6:37:15] juno_sha: I can only run so fast
[6:37:19] nezo_pont: Except if u mess up I blame the mechanics or the healers
[6:37:24] Xastin3: its so hard find decent guild
[6:37:25] ffnd1: wanna tank my TOT 28?
[6:37:25] yipztv: tanking is pain if nobody is calling for you
[6:37:26] njokkio: "we don't want healer affixes" makes afflicted
[6:37:28] greatangelsanguinius: all affix should have counter play
[6:37:31] deepcalm: @jessebona i took a long break from retail i vaguely remember this
[6:37:35] Zaleratv: CRINGE I hadn’t thought about necrotic in a long time
[6:37:40] juno_sha: I like when tank died at 50 stacks and asked for 1 heal PepeLa
[6:37:43] eijisenpai: do you think they should bring back the seasonal affix or you are against it ?
[6:37:45] Morayeden: That was like the corruption negative effects for having too muich corruption
[6:37:55] Aggroboy: for weekly +20s, tank and healer is extremely chill this season, i have been failing upwards
[6:37:59] Morayeden: Just another bfa w
[6:38:06] Jad_Fang_Noxious: Dorki if you use a toy to change the model of the Evoker they will swim through the sky if they use soar (their racial flight thing)
[6:38:11] angrykhoifish: Yeah, I really like ellesmere's cook on affixes. One weekly affix, 1 seasonal affix, that's it. Instead of tyrannical, i think they should make a weekly version of shrouded but without the buffs. Basically random mobs are lieutenant mobs to change up routing and stuff instead of making bosses harder
[6:38:12] Xastin3: why not have more difficult boss's in M+ and just not have affixes. make player hp much higher and make healing attrition again
[6:38:12] Hoshma46: every affix is a healer affix
[6:38:23] Hoshma46: xdd
[6:38:24] yipztv: having to set up stops and everything before every pull is so mind taxing
[6:38:24] fizzis_: thats why i dont pug high keys, got no group
[6:38:34] yipztv: because each group is different
[6:38:46] daddyissalty: yeah, everyone expect you to tank how they are use to do it xD
[6:38:50] juno_sha: I like how echo just has a stable of raiders that are ready to jump in and have great chemistry to when they play together
[6:38:52] Zacy90: I don't mind tanking without a consistent group, but healing outside of my static is terrible
[6:38:53] njokkio: Tanking pugs is pretty exhausting imo
[6:39:01] Aggroboy: why does Growl keep having good vault luck
[6:39:01] Xastin3: like it so beans pugging on dps... so much that im kinda thinking about stopping till s4
[6:39:14] AyumuTheCub: !drops

[6:39:15] yeyanow: As a healer, can't confirm all affixes are healer affixes
[6:39:31] deepcalm: the gamma+ heroics in wotlk classic were fun because the instance was harder but they also gave you mechanics to do to make ur char stronger, so it felt fun to do, not just punishing
[6:39:47] greatangelsanguinius: if I don’t get this drops reward I’m going non verbal
[6:39:50] yipztv: tourny realm is up
[6:39:52] yipztv: arent u guys practicing
[6:39:54] Xastin3: as healer i refuse to do incorp thats dps affix. my tree is annoying to take cc
[6:40:15] yipztv: I think so
[6:40:16] Vermalech: what up you sexy cat
[6:40:20] jenkinsdonuttv: They should put affixes in raids. Tyran Fyrakk
[6:40:24] yipztv: avoidance
[6:40:38] goop: looking for tourney realm access
[6:40:41] goop: despairjj

[8:28:47] deanw0w69: wait so jr doenst play because he doesnt talk
[8:28:48] frznpro: but he is a great gammer
[8:28:54] menzlo: just macro that does audio weakaura calls
[8:28:54] Galois_rg: high keys are stupid political, I can't stand it
[8:28:58] deanw0w69: and he said fuck ill never talk fuck mdi
[8:29:01] deanw0w69: kinda baseg
[8:29:09] Chewbaccaw: @dorki do some vanilla world dragonriding sometime
[8:29:10] fat_european0: Ellesmere had a based take about that on titanforge podcast
[8:29:13] sweetmyassfish: wait does jr refuse to talk in general or like just on stream
[8:29:31] Messyah: jr might just not be able to talk
[8:29:37] frznpro: some people just pref to game and not com a lot
[8:29:40] cuck_norris__: I don’t think blizzard designs these keys to go beyond 25
[8:29:44] A_Trask: jr is a homie, we respect them
[8:29:45] Zaleratv: why doesn’t JR use like voiceover stuff I’ve seen another player use, it’s wild
[8:29:52] cuck_norris__: so it’s basically a cheese beyond that
[8:30:13] Messyah: Y'all are assuming jr isn't mute or something, like it might not be a choice
[8:30:16] fat_european0: long story short, he says it's too much and that they should tune it so keys are a lot more about throughput rather than crazy coordination, living 1shots etc.
[8:30:23] StupidAussieDrongo: when will keys need a 6th man? monkaHmm
[8:30:25] K4lsdern: NonVerbal
[8:30:32] bozzymodo: I mean he could just fucking talk lol
[8:30:32] crickyb24: Does he just have crippling social anxiety or some shit
[8:30:52] weezull: maybe he can't talk though who knows
[8:30:53] menzlo: don't they just need to buff mob hp
[8:30:58] cuck_norris__: maybe junk  doesn’t speak English
[8:31:09] Messyah: Yeah y'all are assuming he even has the ability to talk
[8:31:10] Sakajaweeya: head enchant?
[8:31:18] Jangoman: healers just need to do what the chess guy did and get an AI managed buttplug that when the group needs a CD it vibrates
[8:31:20] Cakerinotv: i still think healers are too strong, but they kinda have to be right now given the spiky dmg
[8:31:22] Messyah: jr a homie regardless
[8:31:33] WayfarerZwe: whats your team to mdi?
[8:31:40] pezinafm: <3
[8:31:41] cuck_norris__: low key junk bricked my key the other day

[8:58:54] professor_cullman: do you think DH has too much control in keys or would you rather see other tanks get more
[8:58:56] Cakerinotv: neither
[8:59:03] Toketems: I mean BM is okay imo
[8:59:07] z0ut_: What WA is that one that shows ur group keys?
[8:59:12] Xastin3: blizzard really needs rework class utility in warwithin
[8:59:13] Gorrygee: vdh payphone

[8:59:18] Ckraigfriend: what are your stats with potions

[9:03:20] weezull: what is the bug
[9:03:25] cheetoenail: what happened?
[9:03:26] Xastin3: unless they just do 20% more dmg

[9:05:31] the_rainmaker: holy priest and pally shift anywhere with the buffs?
[9:05:56] Nightbot: dorkiCheer Subscribe to my YouTube channel! @ https://www.youtube.com/c/Dorki
[9:06:17] Xastin3: holy probably fine just less damage
[9:06:25] Xastin3: pally seems like good dps
[9:06:34] zachl_: IT IS
[9:06:39] Xastin3: think holy more then disc?
[9:07:17] the_rainmaker: I’ll have to check class discords.  that’s where all the good verified information is at.
[9:07:31] TBouse: are disc and rdruid so popular because of their dps or because of their healing/surviving
[9:07:46] minkip831: even if holy does do more active damage than disc, it has to choose between healing and dps whereas disc does both all the time
[9:08:05] the_rainmaker: redruid is for a brez in most comps with prot pally
[9:08:05] Cakerinotv: idk i think most healers have the throughput but idk about hpal
[9:08:08] K4lsdern: ChurchMan
[9:08:10] DalikSkywing: Need infusion from church man
[9:08:23] DalikSkywing: ChurchMan
[9:08:39] Xastin3: rdruid brings vers buff and brez
[9:08:44] Xastin3: + good damage profiel
[9:09:29] the_rainmaker: hpal got 30% increase on cons which is always down and 25% on their shield which is their holy spender damage ability.  that seems like a good increase
[9:09:37] manlyhandles: ChurchMan
[9:10:11] HeffaBear: @the_rainmaker spoiler, it wasnt
[9:10:48] the_rainmaker: I’m just glad Ret pally buffs didn’t go in effect until bolstering was over
[9:11:49] the_rainmaker: @heffabear Sadge
[9:12:08] TBouse: now mw?
[9:12:11] Xastin3: disc is best at stopping 1shots
[9:13:01] the_rainmaker: a good redruid can pump the damage too; however, most pug rdruid damage I’ve seen is sus
[9:13:35] Cakerinotv: its very active dmg so

[10:37:49] frznpro: OH NO
[10:37:51] Morayeden: @razoj50 The margin to time keys and surviving mechanics get narrower and narrower with each key and you have to solve new problems that weren't an issue you for lower keys.

[10:39:42] KalanosVulpes: I highly suggest getting to 25 you don't even gotta do the raid. It's neat to do end game content though B^) and at 25 there is a xp to gold boost for quests. so you get more cash  instead.
[10:39:43] Morayeden: The great thing about keys is you just hop into the content when you have free time

[10:41:30] Morayeden: Breeders are f tier. Do not play
[10:41:32] razoj50: @Chunkstubbs ye its weird but a lot of players are so bad.  I hit fresh 25 on my rogue 3 weeks ago and top DPSd the raid. already got it geared which was fun
[10:41:34] Boossterr: I’m gunna breed half the planet like ghangis khan
[10:41:52] popularviber: HUH
[10:41:59] Chunkstubbs: @razoj50 yeah the content is chill af. just the community impedes the vibe

[10:43:28] razoj50: @KaladinHS my ban lifts feb 7 LOL
[10:43:32] Xastin3: bears used to pull big Sadge
[10:43:34] Chewbaccaw: id say wowhead has more of a reach, but i say twitch and wowhead because wowhead frequently showcases content creators
[10:43:47] dembro: True
[10:43:54] Morayeden: If you seek out outside resources for your game you're already in a small minority of players.
[10:44:03] dembro: I remember when Wowhead had all those Rextroy articles PauseChamp
[10:44:05] kotoro92: yumytvBench dorkiLook
[10:44:09] Dexzz: The difference between casuals  and regulars is casuals just play for a few months every new expansion the peace but in raw numbers they are much more than regulars

[11:54:05] shavrus: @dorki how much IO points to get you to change that tmog so i dont have to see it whenever you log DH? Corpa
[11:54:06] fabsnipo: what happened to Dorki's stream volume, is he going non-verbal
[11:54:06] dknamey: new flying spot HOLY
[11:54:08] pricebanana: Dorki looking handsome today
[11:54:17] kkw1: is unholy looking better than ret?

[11:54:56] nico_natsu: Do you think fury could have used some buffs too?
[11:54:59] Chimix1: @asuna_qt Surely
[11:55:01] nightSkyy: Did you try any unholy this patch?
[11:55:04] Xastin3: mage is giga locked
[11:55:08] Xastin3: unless arcane
[11:55:09] LsWRLD420: mage n priest never die
[11:55:12] meowphietm: Wasn't meeres doing 30s before the nerfs (although that's meeres)
[11:55:13] nightSkyy: ah right lol
[11:55:15] Naimiria: unholy x2 aug? PauseChamp
[11:55:26] 르으기르: lol how do you still not have the axe KEKW
[11:55:29] nightSkyy: FeelsBadMan
[11:55:44] Morayeden: Leggos are annoying, giga rare giga bis items
[11:55:55] TheShoeboxes: They nerfed rise
[11:55:58] TheShoeboxes: Isn't not required anymore
[11:56:00] stiknork: do u think we see any aug in MDI
[11:56:06] nightSkyy: Until it suddenly does
[11:56:21] suinetel: I dont think Stiknork. Cause MDI keys arent the absolute highest and dps matter in MDI?
[11:56:48] stiknork: ya im mostly curious if aug does actual good dmg if all pulls are perfectly coordinated around breath etc
[11:57:03] suinetel: Boss etc surviability isnt issue in MDI I think so Aug is DPS loss?
[11:57:43] 르으기르: Aug isn't a flat dps loss tho
[11:57:43] LsWRLD420: i wonder if dev could get in mdi tbh
[11:57:53] kesslive: chat we need 2 dps
[11:57:57] kesslive: big dam only
[11:58:02] KeyOnRestarting: At what point does blizz admit the drop rate on the axe is a problem we are on the .5 patch and they estimate 22% of people that have touched mythic have seen the axe and only 14% of people who have killed heroic fyrakk
[11:58:03] shauri_tv: this week will be kinda shit again for unholy, tanks will be pulling mobs even more out of defile -.- but yeah there are a few dungeons that suck for unholy
[11:58:04] Xastin3: firemage disc is locked.
[11:58:14] suinetel: I think the top guys were saying Aug is 5-12% dps loss at absolute highest level. But I am not sure.
[11:58:41] RurryDiff: YOU DONT KNOW THE PAIN OF EVOEKR LEGO
[11:58:48] RurryDiff: I FARMED THAT SUCKER EVERY WEEK
[11:58:51] talerx: who cares about evokers
[11:58:52] talerx: anyway
[11:58:54] MierkaBlue: yeah m,y team never saw it drop with 3 hunters, gg
[11:58:55] RurryDiff: AND GOT IT THE LAST WEEK
[11:58:58] Morayeden: I def know the pain
[11:59:14] Boossterr: I think the way you obtain the leggo and the questline is doing superblooms is terrible
[11:59:24] MierkaBlue: Evoker leggo we got last week of the we still cleared
[11:59:32] slashspitme: id say this lego is worse with that fucking superbloom farm
[11:59:34] stiknork: holy full ret key
[12:00:00] nico_natsu: Me playing all 3 plate 2H specs living in no leggo hell :’)
[12:00:01] suinetel: Who nerfed is DOTI Rise now? Seems like large nerfs.
[12:00:04] KeyOnRestarting: I'm curious if they'll bump the item levels of the leggos for season 4
[12:00:11] suinetel: How*
[12:00:14] shauri_tv: got 2 legos in one week, can't complain about the droprate *cough*
[12:00:35] Tofterid: why r you flying on a disk and not a dragon
[12:00:48] stiknork: all my friends are slowly losing their grip on reality each week they dont get legendary
[12:00:48] suinetel: Oh boy, the joy. My Rise score will go off the roof.
[12:00:52] Tofterid: just zoom around anywhere
[12:01:01] hlachezarov: had to do clean run 0 deaths to time 28 rise and now everyone and their mom is gonna time it thanks blizz
[12:01:13] KeyOnRestarting: @tofterid he is hinting to blizz to bring back tazevesh
[12:01:33] Ruinx81: Zero to hero Brew
[12:01:37] Tofterid: fuck tazavesh
[12:01:42] Xastin3: go do 31 rise
[12:01:43] Morayeden: @Tofterid HUH

[12:01:50] hlachezarov: ye but i was so happy that i dont have to do that dungeon ever again after 28 time :D

[12:02:23] Tofterid: but in m+
[12:02:25] Xastin3: bm hunter is deadge
[12:02:32] Tofterid: wew, no thanks
[12:02:37] Patrikhg: any dungeon u have big pulls they are really good
[12:02:46] c3rby_: They bring nothing to the group
[12:02:48] IXYl: BM doesnt bring much to group util
[12:02:57] nightSkyy: I dunno, I must be missing something because i hated the Tazevesh dungeons, but everyone I know and play with loves it
[12:02:59] hlachezarov: @Wiikz go away hater
[12:03:03] daevyfan: @dorki you allow gambit slander?
[12:03:08] edsee_xd: @Poplockz101 27ish
[12:03:16] Chewbaccaw: @dorki honest thoughts about survival hunter
[12:03:20] nautiigaming: @dorki what builds are you running high key with this week?
[12:03:21] Xastin3: cant babysit entire group of deadge classses
[12:03:33] edsee_xd: survival hunter is illegal
[12:03:38] talerx: survival do vers stack
[12:03:43] nightSkyy: But BM hunter is boring AF
[12:03:45] LaxxasGG: @dorki do u think disc's lack of surv will make it worse when people are pushing crazy high
[12:03:47] talerx: so techically could survive better
[12:03:48] joolian: ok but survival has a stick
[12:03:50] c3rby_: survival =l less damage than bm and puts yourself in melee with no melee defensives
[12:03:51] talerx: PepeLa

[12:03:54] Hyvest: peat

[12:09:20] 253templar: @Ark1G disc in pugs is icky man
[12:09:33] marcuuus1337: will unholy be considered in higher keys after buffs ?
[12:09:34] notartradies: does they fix bug with 1rst boss?
[12:09:34] Ark1G: yeah cause interrupts
[12:09:41] LsWRLD420: ya u get interupts with monk eaxy mobil heals
[12:09:47] nightSkyy: I s the TR realm up? Have you been practicing for MDI?
[12:09:48] Ark1G: your not getting title without a group KEKW
[12:09:50] Xastin3: pug disc priest are shadow priests in disquise
[12:09:59] Xastin3: they dont actually heal

[12:11:09] LaxxasGG: growl not streaming??
[12:11:18] stiknork: u can pug title for sure its just a lot of time
[12:11:20] tettles: Dorki, do you think the tank is more responsible for key timers being so short in a lot of dungeons this season more than DPS comps
[12:11:26] stiknork: not super impossible to pug tho
[12:11:38] LaxxasGG: @dorki can u tell growl to stream pls xd
[12:11:41] stiknork: prob took me like 4-5 hours a day
[12:11:41] pvppybreath: Bolstering and Sanguine should both be removed
[12:11:48] shmeat: @tettles when they inv an aug its their fault
[12:11:53] Poplockz101: Hi tettles
[12:12:05] 253templar: Tettles is about to get somethign nerfed again
[12:12:12] Xastin3: are dps timers short? i mean 30 death comps clearing
[12:12:21] tettles: idk if you watch lotus, but he's been playing Moonkin Mage Spriest and they're pretty far under their timer
[12:12:22] KeyOnRestarting: Praise be to tettles
[12:12:29] tettles: but i dont think their comp is particularly good
[12:12:34] biblicalsideboob: some of these dungeons have such low mob count
[12:12:56] nightbreeze93: everbloom prison Gladge
[12:13:06] 3MadOx: EB owns
[12:13:07] Xastin3: dorki loves everbloom
[12:13:09] tettles: well why do OL / Havoc do so much more damage than those specs but dont speed up the key a lot
[12:13:15] akeelian: xdd
[12:13:15] stiknork: what do u make of aug comps having faster timers on every dungeon tho
[12:13:19] stiknork: just not enough ppl playing no aug comps?

[12:15:45] aliveback: !plater
[12:15:53] tettles: might be something weird with mage damage (on the meters ofc they're still very good). Mage in some comps seems like it bot frags, then you put it with a moonkin and it starts doing actual damage
[12:15:58] shmeat: firstGarf
[12:16:06] th3notoriousJay: dafuq sanguine again!?
[12:16:24] BK3R_TV: hi bro i am a new player what you reccomend to play and what can i do at lvl 70 as just hit it the other day and lost, i know there is m + and raids what else. do i get gear ?and how do i do that
[12:16:31] LadGoldfish: @tettles Mage also does their damage by ST blasting a prio target, which while not reflecting on the meters speeds shit up
[12:16:33] 3MadOx: @tettles do you think mage benefits from people with less prio damage in the group. I feel like if you have 2 prio classes it can hurt their overall
[12:16:36] Xastin3: mage is giga pyro dmg
[12:16:37] cbbl: but outlaw also does big prio dmg
[12:16:42] stiknork: yea prio dmg is insane
[12:16:57] stiknork: our udk swapped to fire mage and does 20k less overall but keys go 10% faster
[12:17:13] Patrikhg: that fire mage can do both is very nice
[12:17:18] BK3R_TV: hi bro i am a new player what you reccomend to play and what can i do at lvl 70 as just hit it the other day and lost, i know there is m + and raids what else. do i get gear ?and how do i do that
[12:17:34] benhuve: ASK YOUTUBE
[12:17:35] discomancer1: ask again, that'll get his attention
[12:18:01] 르으기르: play survival hunter
[12:18:06] Xastin3: goood luck hearing no ilvl toons is rough
[12:18:17] Xastin3: gearing
[12:18:51] nightSkyy: Ethically gearing no ilvl toons
[12:18:52] Ale2104: holy cheetos.. retri actually pumps hard in aoe. wtf
[12:18:52] MightyGIGACHAD: vdh dmg balanced :)
[12:19:11] Xastin3: 480 or no nvite to anything
[12:19:26] sitonbench: @BK3R_TV if u just hit 70 go to emerald dream and get gear, then do m+
[12:19:26] Devosenpai: Is "sanguine ichor" streaming too? :D
[12:19:44] stiknork: something u can do on a new char is just fly around collecting green orbs in a dreamsurge zone then work order whelping dreaming crests for full 447 gear
[12:19:50] stiknork: prob takes like 2 hours for a full set or so
[12:20:00] stiknork: dunno if its most efficient but i like doin it
[12:20:07] pvppybreath: I did the 447 crafting thing and I don't think it was worth the time. Just do M+ imo.
[12:20:13] sitonbench: @stiknork that's a waste of time when u can get much better gear elsewhere in less time
[12:20:17] Xastin3: best suggest is make friend get them carry your till you have gear to do content
[12:20:33] Xastin3: cause pugging doesnt happen
[12:20:36] fancyboy1950: guys incorpeal spawn every 45sec?????
[12:20:40] fancyboy1950: or not
[12:20:45] Akyran: @stiknork i mean once you did lfr, heroic and normal raid for that week you can fill the rest of the slots with 447 and jump into m+ after
[12:20:47] nightSkyy: Or if you have disposable income, just buy tokens and buy heroic gear boosts
[12:20:49] Akyran: pretty nice to get decent stats
[12:20:59] stiknork: yea i think its a good way to get started but my friends thought it was boring
[12:21:04] stiknork: up to opinion i guess
[12:21:19] Xastin3: people dont invite below 480
[12:22:19] stiknork: theres also catchup gear for flightstones added today but not helpful if u dont have another character
[12:22:38] Xastin3: even that doesnt help its too low to mater
[12:22:55] stiknork: yea u just run ur own key until 480
[12:22:58] shiratto: game needs aspect crest catch up
[12:22:59] stiknork: cant get invited to anything
[12:23:26] Xastin3: i tried run my own key. tried gear ret pally. went from 398 to 470 and
[12:23:34] dumbrandomchatter: @stiknork where do you get that gear
[12:23:36] Xastin3: people dont que for keys if its your own
[12:23:43] Xastin3: and you cant join anyone key
[12:23:46] Xastin3: they never invite
[12:23:50] stiknork: @stiknork i think its off the person who drops ur keystone in val
[12:24:05] Orangel1ght: are the Pallas
[12:24:07] stiknork: i mean ur a pally if ur chaining 18s u can just play prot
[12:24:10] Xastin3: it was litterally misserable
[12:24:26] Orangel1ght: are the pallys axed up
[12:24:43] Xastin3: i just decided alt wasnt worth it went back 487 r druid
[12:25:15] Xastin3: very few people die que and wait for a tank had no idea what they were doing in dungeons and did turbo bad dmg and didnt know routes
[12:25:38] Xastin3: just overall unfun experience
[12:25:48] KeyOnRestarting: Fingers crossed they remove the crest cap soon
[12:25:56] shappening: what key level were you trying to do?
[12:26:02] Xastin3: 18-20
[12:26:09] stiknork: yea i cant play 18-20s without a tank
[12:26:12] L1ghtxyz: @KeyOnRestarting crest cap doesnt even matter tho?
[12:26:17] stiknork: i either just play tank spec on anything that can tank or wait for a friend to login
[12:26:18] shappening: just tank them instead for faster farming
[12:26:26] Xastin3: 18-20 should been comfortable farming spot
[12:26:31] KhetumTV: @KeyOnRestarting wdym crest cap ? u have enough at this point to upgrade everything to max and craft multiple no ?
[12:26:41] deepcalm: gd ret pallies going off
[12:26:55] L1ghtxyz: they should increase rat of acquiring crests if they want to encourage playing alts
[12:27:14] shappening: let me transfer crests from my main
[12:27:16] KhetumTV: crest rate would be nice tho indeed
[12:27:21] KhetumTV: and transfer
[12:27:31] Xastin3: its not alt issue its just community so biased they wont invite you to groups unlesss our 486 doing 15
[12:27:37] Naowh: Wtf u still live
[12:27:39] IceAddict_: should just make everything account bound, let me trade anything i want to any chars
[12:27:45] Xastin3: and no one wants wat on tank queue up
[12:28:00] shappening: @Xastin3 what score does your main have?
[12:28:07] Xastin3: 2900
[12:28:14] nerefwow: @Naowh Dorki doesn't need sleep
[12:29:29] neetisTV: why no cheese play :P ?
[12:29:31] L1ghtxyz: should be able to buy an item on main if you are aspect crest capped that increases all crest gains account wide by 50% or something
[12:30:11] shappening: @Xastin3 that's pretty low, doesn't help your alt too much but there are easy keys you will always be able to fill up fast like fall, wm, ad
[12:30:19] trin_jp: naowh just annoyed that dorki is still streaming because he takes all his viewers and subs
[12:30:24] neetisTV: i thought u can play 1st boss full time 100% dmg amp or is it fixed?
[12:30:39] Xastin3: i mean its mix 20-22s. i havent tried push any higher dont feel like watching pugs die 1 shots
[12:30:47] alexhall17: can you show talents when you get a chance?
[12:30:55] Xastin3: i dont have steady group
[12:30:56] Hyvest: SNIFFA
[12:31:01] L1ghtxyz: honestly, just make some friends
[12:31:07] L1ghtxyz: i have made so many friends by just pugging keys
[12:31:24] Xastin3: i had friends shadowlands scared them all away
[12:31:29] L1ghtxyz: and at some point u have like a group of 10+ people and a discord chat and u can always find people to play with
[12:31:41] Xastin3: been trhough 5 guilds in shadowlands mythic raiding... they all die cause they dont get ce
[12:31:44] dominopomino: Dorki's just waiting for naowh to go live so he can raid him back and go to bedge
[12:32:07] Xastin3: just gets tiring looking for new people
[12:32:28] DarrenSandstone: @Xastin3 u seem like the typical wow gamer who likes to complain where everyone else is the problem and u do everything perfect
[12:32:37] pvppybreath: this guy's face is fucked up
[12:32:42] L1ghtxyz: @Xastin3 yeah i get that
[12:32:51] Shreddermus: Survivla hunter s+ now
[12:32:55] razzaqzzz: razzaqzzz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[12:33:04] Xastin3: i mea ive been wow playr since 204
[12:33:04] deepcalm: @Xastin3 you know what they say... wherever you go... there you are
[12:33:07] Xastin3: 2004
[12:33:33] Xastin3: im not saying there isnt good people out there its just not fun finding them
[12:33:57] DarrenSandstone: @Xastin3 then u should be able to carry the dungeons more, take more responsibility for the key, I played WoW for a month or two and is 3100 only pugging
[12:34:16] Xastin3: i can push higher
[12:34:17] shappening: yeah 23s are free af and you are 3100
[12:34:26] Xastin3: im littlerally not trying to push
[12:34:28] pvppybreath: I've been playing my paladin tank alt for 8 days and I'm 2400 at 469 ilvl
[12:34:39] Xastin3: there no reason to push higher... im not going for title
[12:34:45] gandivh: Hi Dorki are you playing without  demon spike dmg reduction and inc duration_
[12:34:50] gandivh: ?*
[12:34:58] shappening: I mean you'll get much easier invites as ret this week
[12:35:10] Xastin3: if there was better gear above 20's i would push higher
[12:35:12] DarrenSandstone: @Xastin3 then I dont understand your rant? if u dont wanna push the part of finding group is not so important
[12:35:22] Xastin3: my rant is pug scene sux for alts
[12:35:31] pvppybreath: The reason to push higher keys is for fun and challenge
[12:35:32] Xastin3: i dont get why you think i want push higher on my main
[12:35:38] medivalsloth: @Xastin3 then push ur own key
[12:35:42] Xastin3: i tried
[12:35:44] Shreddermus: Ret paly brain kicking tthe same XD
[12:35:46] Xastin3: people dont queu for it
[12:35:47] Nightbot: dorkiHey Join my Discord server! https://discord.gg/yHFTAZn
[12:35:48] shappening: pugging is really good right now on alts, think you just a hater, no flame
[12:35:51] elliott7620: double ret oof
[12:35:53] Xastin3: you sit 30min waiting on tank
[12:36:05] medivalsloth: @Xastin3 then go find some community like no pressure or any streamers discord
[12:36:20] Nightbot: dorkiCheer Subscribe to my YouTube channel! @ https://www.youtube.com/c/Dorki
[12:36:36] Xastin3: and whena tank does queue up they pull 2 mobs at time
[12:36:43] Devosenpai: @Xastin3 Thats why started playing tank myself
[12:36:45] 르으기르: send friend requests after good runs, add people, network around
[12:36:50] Xastin3: and turn it into deplete cause they have no idea of route
[12:37:00] medivalsloth: well you can't expect tanks playing on sanguine, same healers on bursting, it's just normal thing that those classes usually don't play when week is hard for them
[12:37:02] Zawaken_: either play tank or healer yourself, easy keys
[12:37:04] 김루백: Hi
[12:37:12] deepcalm: part of the reason my main is a tank is that it's easier to find groups lol
[12:37:18] Xastin3: im healer main
[12:37:24] Xastin3: i was just trying have dps alt
[12:37:29] DarrenSandstone: @Xastin3 dont understand why you bother playing the game when everything is a problem and a whole chat is giving tips and u find problems with it all
[12:37:35] medivalsloth: @deepcalm ye, as tank it's ez xD if u cdh or prot pala then insta queue
[12:37:39] elliott7620: is double ret actually guna bea  thing?
[12:37:43] shappening: sanguine topping NotLikeThis
[12:37:45] benhuve: @DarrenSandstone +1
[12:37:57] Xastin3: lol the tips people are providing are solving problems i dont have
[12:38:09] Chewbaccaw: your problem is that you're a healer
[12:38:10] Xastin3: and saying alting right now in pugs is fun is crazy
[12:38:19] shappening: it is
[12:38:20] Chewbaccaw: we have the best doctors working on you, you will recover
[12:38:21] Xastin3: sitting in queue waiting for 1 tank queue up isnt fun
[12:38:23] Hekistylz: maybe the problem you have is yourself, at least that's what is looking like
[12:38:30] shappening: alts are 480 after a reset

[12:38:33] benhuve: sometimes it feels like your creating problems bruh that are non existing
[12:38:42] oswalb: pugging on main feels rly bad this season tho, keys up to ~24 are free and then u have like insanely terrible players in ur 25/26 keys and it's just soooo demoralising
[12:38:42] neetisTV: what is this pally dmg....
[12:38:53] Xastin3: i mean if my pally could find tanks to farm crests it be 480
[12:39:17] shappening: @oswalb sounds like I joined one of your higher keys, sorry bud LUL
[12:39:20] pvppybreath: just tank lmao
[12:39:20] Xastin3: i was able push 20 and entire heroic clear pugging it just was misserable
[12:39:33] pvppybreath: 20s are so low...
[12:39:36] Chewbaccaw: take a break bro
[12:39:47] Xastin3: if i wanted to tank id just play tank... its dps alt
[12:39:48] Chewbaccaw: play other video games
[12:40:02] pvppybreath: try Stardew Valley
[12:40:07] Chewbaccaw: HOLY GOOD GAME
[12:40:18] Xastin3: 20s are low
[12:40:19] deepcalm: pugging hard content in wow has always been a bad time. there's not really a solution, that's just the way it is
[12:40:23] Xastin3: but gearing stops at 20s
[12:40:32] Chewbaccaw: retired wow mpluser finds solace in video game farming date simulator
[12:40:37] nerefwow: xddPeat
[12:40:40] shmeat: this mf just YAPPP
[12:40:44] pvppybreath: doing stuff in WoW for gear alone is cringe
[12:40:53] oswalb: @deepcalm this is true to an extent but it's particularly bad at least to me this season
[12:41:02] Chewbaccaw: @pvppybreath you're just typing W's tonight huh?
[12:41:04] Xastin3: what do you do in wow farm mounts?
[12:41:09] Xastin3: fearing whole point of wow
[12:41:12] Xastin3: gearing
[12:41:21] Chipez: wow is outdated.
[12:41:21] julian_fmv: do u have a macro or weakaura to dismount your vendor passengers?
[12:41:22] pvppybreath: I push keys for score
[12:41:25] shappening: you are so narrow minded how do you even make it to the toilet bro
[12:41:26] Chewbaccaw: @Xastin3 crafting, map completion, rep grinding for cosmetics
[12:41:29] elliott7620: having 2 rets must be nice in high keys with all the utility
[12:41:31] Zawaken_: have fun? do keys for score?
[12:41:40] Xastin3: pushing a number is cringe
[12:41:43] Xastin3: it doesnt give anything
[12:41:44] MattCGs: @Chewbaccaw map completion is kinda funny lol
[12:41:52] pvppybreath: it provides a challenge
[12:41:54] Chewbaccaw: like doing the map achievement shit
[12:41:57] nightSkyy: Calling other people's fun "cringe" is cringe
[12:41:59] Chewbaccaw: make my brain go brr
[12:42:06] shappening: @nightskyy truuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue
[12:42:25] vellocets: what happens if they sac each other
[12:42:26] Chipez: Everyone has different dopamine needs
[12:42:29] vellocets: do they die
[12:42:29] oswalb: like idk i didnt play s2 but in s1 once u got past maybe 23 u had mostly blasters and (most) ppl had decent attitudes
[12:42:30] Chewbaccaw: yeah but if you're way of fun is stressing you out, then it is cringe that u keep doing that 'fun' thing
[12:42:30] pvppybreath: this game basically begins once you have BiS or near to it
[12:42:34] shmeat: i just chatgpt in goldshire and make millions of gold
[12:42:46] pvppybreath: because then you improve yourself, not your gear
[12:42:51] Xastin3: gearing characters is fun
[12:42:55] pvppybreath: it is
[12:43:01] shappening: yeah sounds like you are having a blast
[12:43:03] Chewbaccaw: like im playing an iron man survival hunter right now
[12:43:06] Chewbaccaw: because im a fucking freak
[12:43:07] Xastin3: my druid sitting in near bis and its got nothing todo
[12:43:12] Avelstoon: does the priest stream? =p
[12:43:13] pvppybreath: push score
[12:43:27] shmeat: ofc you hate the game you play druid HOLY
[12:43:28] L1ghtxyz: @Xastin3 clear mythic raid, push some score :)
[12:43:35] dominopomino: @shmeat based
[12:43:42] nightSkyy: @Avelstoon sometimes, but the real content is his killer Ted talks
[12:43:44] Chewbaccaw: shmeat W posting
[12:43:46] Xastin3: ive tried. got my post up for mythic raid group.
[12:43:52] Xastin3: still looking
[12:43:57] Chewbaccaw: has m+ ever been for the gear
[12:43:59] Xastin3: all want me xfer to dedge servers
[12:43:59] Avelstoon: @nightskyy 100%
[12:44:11] oswalb: @shmeat the ppl who really hate the game are aff players
[12:44:12] MattCGs: @Xastin3 whats character name?
[12:44:17] pvppybreath: some people play M+ for gear in early season because it's infinitely farmable
[12:44:18] Xastin3: xastii
[12:44:22] Xastin3: stormrage
[12:44:49] Chewbaccaw: stormrage player
[12:44:53] Chewbaccaw: thats just lite moonguard
[12:44:57] Xastin3: what?
[12:45:02] Chewbaccaw: u heard me
[12:45:04] Xastin3: its best alliance server
[12:45:04] deepcalm: i think too many ppl watch streamers "casually" doing +28 everblooms and think "i should be able to do that too" and then get frustrated at pugs when their +21 EB goes badly
[12:45:08] Banoffeh: was farming all week for gen blood on my disc and i just got it in vault, what a blessed day
[12:45:12] Chewbaccaw: thats what all alliance players say
[12:45:14] shmeat: hey i play on moon guard Madge
[12:45:22] suinetel: @Yumytv Ninjastream!?
[12:45:25] Xastin3: sorry i dont want to be tauren
[12:45:29] Chewbaccaw: BRO U GO ON ANY OTHER ALLY SERVER GOLDSHIRES DEAD
[12:45:29] dominopomino: @oswalb I guess the opposite must be true. If you still play the game while playing affliction you must really love the game to keep going
[12:45:36] deepcalm: that's like watching lebron james and then getting mad at the ppl at your gyms basketball court because they can't pass
[12:45:40] Chewbaccaw: but stormrage, goldshires popping off
[12:46:04] Xastin3: i mean there like 4 real servers

[12:46:31] Chewbaccaw: we will see double ret in mdi
[12:46:52] Zawaken_: I've been wanting to pick up affli @dominopomino, but I have started hating the game as well
[12:46:53] suinetel: Cannot be 2 same class in MDI?
[12:46:59] julian_fmv: Yo dorki, why lariat over infused with decay for boots??
[12:46:59] 253templar: @Avelstoon yes, you cant time any key higher then a +10 without 2 rest
[12:47:00] suinetel: or spec* at least?
[12:47:10] L1ghtxyz: @suinetel same class yes same spec no
[12:47:13] oswalb: @oswalb the amount of ppl u see in the lock discord playing it bc their rl gaslit them into it is kinda crazy

[12:47:44] elliott7620: we seeing any uh keys today?
[12:47:44] shavrus: @dorki maybe with ret pala becoming more and more used (currently) should you start tracking sac in case some people dont have 1 min sac?
[12:47:57] tyr303: @dwinchh piips or signet brand for vengens tank?
[12:47:58] Chewbaccaw: what the fuck is a resto shaman
[12:47:58] mieko29: DEADASS what is this comp

[12:48:04] Shreddermus: free
[12:48:23] Chewbaccaw: survival hunter truly slept on
[12:48:26] cravius13: you play hammer spin talent now for ret after buffs?
[12:48:47] oswalb: i dont think ive seen a sv player not fucking own me this entire season
[12:48:47] deepcalm: ret pally got buffed big paladins rise up we takin over

[12:53:51] Zawaken_: @Chewbaccaw yeah hpally feels awful
[12:53:55] SpeedyMcD: what make ret pally the most popular dps? is it just easy?
[12:53:58] witty95: @elliott7620 idk man but ver mastery is really not that nice to have, id sim it with 2minutes 5bosstargets?
[12:53:59] tyr303: why is it the new god comp? :D
[12:54:01] MBG_95: with Ashes being so good, have they ever tried Crusade? or is that still dogwater?

[12:55:28] Chewbaccaw: hpally cant be that bad to play
[12:55:47] moonflection: What are the disadvantages of playing bear druid right now they seem even with prot pal and veng dh
[12:55:50] Xastin3: hpal feels awful right now
[12:55:55] Zawaken_: Spenders don't do anything currently
[12:55:55] Chewbaccaw: i always feel like when i play that spec if I don't have giga gear my holy shock heals for shit
[12:56:11] donkeyu: is ret really good now?
[12:56:13] alexhall17: do you not find it necessary to run calcified spikes?
[12:56:15] Xastin3: holy power abilities just dont do anything
[12:56:30] nightSkyy: Wonder if Blizz will lean into the support class and make more of them, or just abandon ship and slowly tune Aug into a dps spec
[12:56:56] deepcalm: slowly tune aug into a drakkonid form tank spec
[12:57:05] Sunrise63: 1,8m jesus
[12:57:06] Chewbaccaw: nah with the new talent tree system I don't see another support spec coming next expac
[12:57:28] deepcalm: drakkonid form would be sick
[12:57:41] Zawaken_: Hpally is still my main even if terrible though
[12:57:45] nightSkyy: Imagine 2 expacs with only 1 support spec which is close to mandatory monka
[12:58:01] LightdarkGaming: dont have to imagine, its gonna happen
[12:58:01] Chewbaccaw: atleast its not 6 years of farming ap daily
[12:58:03] Chewbaccaw: :)
[12:58:07] nightSkyy: I support the drakkonid tank route if thats the case
[12:58:24] Xastin3: honestly didnt hate legion ap farming. it was something to do.
[12:58:34] Chewbaccaw: thats becuz legion it was a new thing
[12:58:35] Xastin3: and farming legendaries was kinda fun
[12:58:45] Xastin3: doing previous tier circuits
[12:58:48] Chewbaccaw: world quests were new as well
[12:59:06] nightSkyy: With the return of the black empire shenanigans, do you think we will get corruptions back? because that shit was fun AF
[12:59:10] deepcalm: legion farming was fun because you were powering up your sick ass weapon, not some lame necklace
[12:59:19] nightSkyy: Once you had a good way of getting them, anyway
[12:59:29] Xastin3: legion there was always something to work on
[13:00:17] witty95: https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/7vTFCuyWLLBAaMTidvVtAZ guess ill not take the leech weapon sadge
[13:00:20] suinetel: Jesus, my PuGs this morning have been braindead. I am starting to question my sanity
[13:00:21] Chewbaccaw: they should've abandoned ap in shadowlands
[13:00:34] mk__9: dorki still live GIGACHAD
[13:01:09] JamaBear: since when is this a tanking stream? Smadge
[13:01:19] mk__9: guys dorki is adjusting to Eu hours to prepare for his echo arc
[13:01:30] Zawaken_: @Xastin3 seeing bdks smack she shit out of mobs with twillight dev was fucking glorious
[13:01:33] whizzxl: hows shadow looking? back to meta ?
[13:01:35] PihlziNh0: thats the problem with ret, no prio damage at all
[13:01:48] Xastin3: twilight dev was so stupid
[13:01:49] mk__9: @PihlziNh0 YEP
[13:01:52] zeusolga20: oh ty for the toy i had a good nap while you doing m+
[13:01:56] Xastin3: talk about game ruining balance
[13:02:03] Zawaken_: it was so fun
[13:02:03] TheCrypticMind: @witty95 dont forget to sim as 4/4 mythic (not that I think it would matter)
[13:02:14] Xastin3: tank doing more 2x dps dmg
[13:02:18] mk__9: ret is the literal opposit of enha shaman
[13:02:19] Xastin3: while healing to full
[13:02:21] mk__9: in every way possible
[13:02:41] witty95: @TheCrypticMind how do i do that
[13:02:55] Xastin3: litterally was rediculous. i dont think they have put anything more broken in game then twilight dev
[13:03:10] TheCrypticMind: @TheCrypticMind should be an option on the item to fully upgrade it before you sim
[13:03:34] Zawaken_: corruptions in general, but damn seeing shit blow up from  stars or twillight dev made the game more fun
[13:03:41] witty95: @TheCrypticMind found it, simming it
[13:03:57] Avelstoon: this sanguine ichor guy is a great healer. hes pumping
[13:04:18] Xastin3: i mean by end that expansion your really were not playing classes you were walking shooting star or twilght dev
[13:04:25] Xastin3: it had least class flavor
[13:04:34] Xastin3: i actually didnt like that point of wow
[13:04:46] witty95: https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/jaRmgEVAsfVAiXhBetM4pA did actually make a difference
[13:05:15] TheCrypticMind: @witty95 nice!
[13:05:39] witty95: @TheCrypticMind appreciate it, question is if 3k more dps is worht it LUL

[13:07:17] gandivh: Hi Dorki are you playing without Demonspikes dmg reduction and period increase?
[13:07:37] BLACKFOOT_TN: Bro fuck this Legendary farm. Its worse than the damn Evoker lego shit.
[13:07:50] loggers234: what are dzy's talents look like?

[13:09:49] BLACKFOOT_TN: Ret meta now?
[13:09:56] BLACKFOOT_TN: @chat
[13:10:03] Xastin3: ret in top 5 dps
[13:10:07] Xastin3: not sure meta
[13:10:15] BLACKFOOT_TN: Eh close enough
[13:10:30] Shimorta: no prio damage gonna hurt this iteration of ret forever probably
[13:10:38] Xastin3: yeah
[13:10:47] TripleFX2K: dad
[13:10:54] Xastin3: ret very tank good utility. aoe pumper
[13:11:39] BLACKFOOT_TN: Wonder if the Lego and Augery will give rets the boost to be great
[13:12:14] Xastin3: nah they just need that be top5
[13:12:22] Xastin3: ret without legendary isnt class
[13:12:54] iscanor001: what do mean ret is insane he dosn't need lego to be top dps
[13:13:13] Xastin3: ret worse then firemage even with legendary
[13:13:26] Xastin3: its way worse then firemage without it
[13:13:52] BLACKFOOT_TN: I mean it could be worse. It could be Fury bad. My main...
[13:13:53] Shifter2k: So it seems like you are still better bringing other specs, even after the buffs ^^
[13:14:14] Shimorta: are they even top 5 dps? are they better than any of: fire mage, outlaw rogue, havoc dh, boomie, aug, demo lock?
[13:14:15] Xastin3: warrior doesnt have relevent spec currently
[13:14:19] Xastin3: its in bad place
[13:14:38] Xastin3: id put them around demo lock sprist
[13:14:49] Xastin3: maybe they can replce aug
[13:14:55] Sangomah: prot warriors are always "please  let there be some dungeons where my spell reflect is OP"
[13:15:05] qtceef: @Xastin3 ? fury is good what
[13:15:14] Xastin3: fury is good at what?
[13:15:20] Xastin3: they have no utility
[13:15:21] Shimorta: not a bad spot to be though for ret now tbh
[13:15:28] BLACKFOOT_TN: Arms is dogshit. And Fury has ok burst but quickly drops off in AOE. Fury needs a constant bleed that actually does something to help with burst gaps.
[13:16:37] BLACKFOOT_TN: Actually I take that back
[13:16:47] Xastin3: im big believer blizzard needs rebalance most classes utility. there some classes that have almost none. other theat have it all
[13:16:48] BLACKFOOT_TN: Fury just needs Jesus at this point.
[13:17:10] iscanor001: fury good on nothing that he dosn't bring good dps so who give shit about that class anymore
[13:17:12] Xastin3: fury to be relevent need to do20% more dmg all other specs to be relevent
[13:17:41] OldManHeph: Warrior and DK are in dire need of a rework
[13:17:48] Xastin3: agreed
[13:17:48] Myusen: @Xastin3 chatting
[13:17:54] Xastin3: dont agree?
[13:18:10] Xastin3: classes with no utility are not braught to dungeons
[13:18:13] BLACKFOOT_TN: What gets me is Blizzard has skipped over Fury on multiple class tuning this expansion. If anything they fucking nerfed it with the rally nerf lol.
[13:18:17] Shimorta: DK needs god, hope they're next rework for sure. their class tree is abysmal and UH tree is so badly designed lmfao
[13:18:59] EmElw: surely the minimal changes now means big changes in next expac
[13:19:08] Sangomah: @Xastin3 it depends on the dungeon set as well, so that changes widely. This season is prob the most utility based dungeon set we have had in a long while, if not ever?
[13:19:35] BLACKFOOT_TN: Fury isn't "Terrible" class tree wise. I've seen far worse. But seeing all Warrior specs just suck donkey dick for months is harsh.
[13:19:40] Xastin3: i feel like dungeon set pretty avg compared to prior expansions
[13:19:50] Xastin3: always needed stops and dispelss
[13:20:06] Harleybane: brewmaster should be by far the most needed rework, buttonbloat, impossible to balance stagger, mastery being shit against half of the dmg scources, haste being non excistent for us in terms of worth.
[13:20:06] Xastin3: biggest thing this season is mobs have no hp
[13:20:28] mk__9: @Shimorta i think the DK class tree is fine
[13:20:33] Xastin3: so burst classes look better then ever
[13:20:48] mk__9: maybe they can remove some junk nodes but there a lot of strong points in there
[13:21:00] Miaaoouuw: wft double retry no play retry, 5% up st all play retry ahahha
[13:21:08] Shimorta: @Shimorta you can't even take wraithwalk or AMZ without losing insane damage
[13:21:09] Miaaoouuw: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[13:21:50] Xastin3: you wanted to only be bumble kneels instead of wheelchair mode.... minus dmg
[13:23:29] rimedkarub: Guys, thorncaller claw 483 or 489 Crit/haste weap?
[13:23:45] Circlesz_: sim it
[13:23:54] rimedkarub: does sim work for tank?
[13:23:58] Circlesz_: yes
[13:24:05] rimedkarub: ty
[13:24:47] un4knblvble: @rimedkarub Crafted 489 weapon
[13:24:57] Samcaekz: works for dps, not for defensive though, defensive you need to feelycraft
[13:25:17] BLACKFOOT_TN: @rimedkarub sim it. The proc can be worth keeping over a 489
[13:25:28] Crane86: is this the ret meta we've been waiting for?
[13:25:55] sunnib01: what are u thought on raze as guardian dudu i like u use the ironfur build but dont know how much dmg loss it is
[13:25:57] sweetmyassfish: ive been saying
[13:25:59] sweetmyassfish: for months now
[13:26:02] sweetmyassfish: ret is meta
[13:26:04] Aggroboy: Ret with Leggo = meta?
[13:26:04] sweetmyassfish: nobody believed me
[13:26:19] Xastin3: cause it wasnt months ago
[13:26:23] ShaggySummers: Dorki is seeing ret
[13:26:31] Garzag_: all it took was 30% damage buff for people to play them xdd
[13:26:42] deepcalm: call it the Uther comp, the order of the Silver Hand returns
[13:26:54] Blloood: As a ret paladin player, I hate this new god comp...
[13:26:56] IXYl: At what key level does routing really start to matter?
[13:27:00] Aggroboy: meanwhile Ret players are still crying for more buffs and improvements
[13:27:15] sweetmyassfish: ret does need to be fixed
[13:27:18] Aggroboy: are paladins the biggest gaslighters?
[13:27:25] sweetmyassfish: no mages are
[13:27:31] BLACKFOOT_TN: Boomies
[13:27:40] Xastin3: ret treee honestly still feels bad. you still have completely swap talents to do single target dmg
[13:27:42] Blloood: We dont want to be meta...we wanna stick to our own corner and whine about buffs
[13:28:06] Aggroboy: Holy Paladins were complaining... even during Season 2!

[13:29:44] Aggroboy: pug rets don't use 80% of their kit
[13:29:55] sweetmyassfish: i guarantee u if u check my chat history 99% of it is bitching about/ hyping up ret
[13:29:57] Shimorta: need MW instead of disc for real gaming
[13:30:15] deepcalm: i mean it makes sense to buff paladins. didn't they name their order after Tyr, and tyr came back, so
[13:30:17] Shimorta: and drop aug for boomie for vers buff
[13:30:19] Xastin3: cant drop disc. pi too  big for firemage

[13:31:56] Xastin3: VDH, boomkin, firemage, ret, disc. you get vers, fort, int magic debuff, pally aura, thats god comp. all classes cant die except boomkin
