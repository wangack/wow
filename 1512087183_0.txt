[3:34:31] Don_Low: personal loot
[3:34:32] nolifeAlice: personal loot was most fair system

[3:36:48] Cybernytez: blizzard should just allow the guilds to decide themselves which lootsystem they want to use that way nobody can complain because u dont have to be in that guidl right
[3:36:56] Boroborgeran: forget prot i want to see arms dual
[3:37:04] Slayer_Eagleone: TWO RAGUS!!
[3:37:28] delirious555: I was just thinking if it was personal loot and no master loot allowed that should kill gdkp, right?

[3:40:46] delirious555: Those who want to go for world first kill should do it on a special server where master looting is allowed and then after they get achieve they go back to normal server and have to gear up with only personal loot. Just an idea. Maybe it's bad. I don't know.

[3:47:14] elitistdk: LUL
[3:47:19] Misfit980: If they do cata it‚Äôll be a with a lot of changes I think they might just restart with classic + or wotlk ++

[3:49:33] Anoffday: @brianlawl yeah its not my favorite, but ive had some fun with it
[3:49:43] Cybernytez: SL is definetly not balanced, alone the fact that Hpriest is omega broken rn proves it and almost everyone playing it xd

[4:02:03] norrlandssilver: swifty i never thought i see the day that you played rogue :D
[4:02:17] KodiakJedi: They should rename the oneshot macro the Swifty macro.
[4:02:25] BallinciagaTV: if they trinket they ded
[4:02:36] Parru030: What are you as class in human life?
[4:02:42] thedonmac: now your talkin
[4:02:50] jackpepsimba: as a noob who plays a rogue, I think rogues are just fine rn
[4:03:05] SmokyBoost: ok
[4:03:12] KodiakJedi: Sub is a lot more complicated
[4:03:14] Parru030: i am Rogue, and then i understand shaman life

[4:03:26] iHaste: rogues and mages will always be broken
[4:03:31] KodiakJedi: No...every game is Mage Rogue or RMP in PvP at the top
[4:03:52] Englesyn: to be fair... Shadowlands is very balanced compared to other expansions... at least games arnt 30min long

[4:04:24] Englesyn: i would rather get blown up than waste a 30min match im going to lose
[4:04:37] aviduser2: hi swift, u got beta?

[4:05:11] TheNaightFox: but arena wise u can see every class on top 30 right ? its not only rogues i mean most are rogues but other classes are up there as well
[4:05:11] rouji: A lot of classes can blow you up in 2 seconds, rogues just need minimal prep time

[4:33:20] TheEndIsNear777: you do have to do all this in order to have a chance in Pvp because conduits/legendaries are tied to pve
[4:33:22] KusoTrevor: @Swifty you also need to grind rep to get the second lego to 291
[4:33:26] ReconCrusade: i hate all these never ending grinds

[4:36:17] KusoTrevor: @Swifty you're telling the truth. Some folks like to deny it cause they're not actually new to SL.
[4:36:26] AP6969696969696969696969: but isnt it better to put time as a new player to learn?

[4:36:49] ReconCrusade: Im gonna be honest swofty, i think the only possible reason to justify playing wow anymore is to play with friends you know already
[4:36:49] KodiakJedi: It's 9 chapters now
[4:36:50] Cybernytez: it would get boring if we dont have nothing to do, so blizzard needs to provide things to do, people complain that it gets boring and at same time they dont wanan do anything that doenst work
[4:36:54] KodiakJedi: but you can do all 9 in a day
[4:36:59] Molandzer: For a new player it maybe is fun

[4:38:37] KodiakJedi: Thank god they backed him up kappa
[4:39:24] KusoTrevor: @spacemarine55 the new talent trees keep all the legos and covenant effects if you choose to use them it appears.. at least the super popular ones.

[8:06:45] Llloyden: they might make a small change though, that if you dont wint Wintergrasp you might be able to enter from a back door, this is to help the servers which are heavy dominated by a faction so all get to do VOA
[8:07:00] lucasgriffinduke: i had fun in winter grasp
[8:07:05] FV_Mar: lvling an ele sham rn, cant wait to go gear him, been playing rogue all tbc so kinda bored of it lol

[9:21:56] tangdill: I mean dragonflight is coming this year so i think they wanne make money with woltk before that
[9:22:17] Llloyden: wotlk will probably release around september, pre patch sometime in august, nothing confirmed but its likely, especially since they say that Dragonflight will release this year
[9:22:22] dmac614: I can‚Äôt get behind a game where choosing a server chooses weather you have a good time or not
[9:22:24] widepeeposad__: Pagle is nice and wholesome just sucks it doesn‚Äôt have much pvpers
