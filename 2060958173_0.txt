[2:31:29] artilectXLII: ...what if warriors got a rune where they are magic-immune whole enraged?
[2:31:31] don_kneee: yeah devs are kinda just lost tbh
[2:31:37] 8thwndrmusic: every other class is OP
[2:31:44] hajanatorator: bonebiter is only aliance?
[2:31:53] XPunchlineX: 5 sec and 30 min cd KEKW
[2:31:55] RedChaosTV: its in the blue post
[2:31:56] thimpaxd: 10 seconds? more like perma
[2:31:57] hajanatorator: what about whirlwind axe?
[2:31:58] itma1991: The damage is too high so we can't tank it to build rage and one shot
[2:32:02] heroxenophanes: Even 80% would be good
[2:32:03] asnowgoose: nah it would be perfectly balanced
[2:32:05] thimpaxd: Enrage, Flagelltation (Bloodrage + Zerk Rage)
[2:32:10] Cybershade07: Spell Reflect with spell damage reduc for a few sec after?
[2:32:12] itma1991: we need a immune to level the field
[2:32:21] pointmadness: The mind spike rune on shadow priest makes them so insane! Id love to see you run S priest
[2:32:28] makatoottv: i just wish our runes were fine

[2:32:50] 8thwndrmusic: Prot for gnomer
[2:32:55] notgekyo: !song
[2:33:02] thimpaxd: Spell Reflect - If a spell is successfully reflected you gain 75% magic dmg reduction for 5 sec
[2:33:03] Toobak: Spell reflect and grenades are so important for pvp warriors, could be cool to get a rune similar to that
[2:33:06] Noodli_: run a shield ? or 2 1h's?
[2:33:09] kolacap: They need leech off of deep wounds or on hit.
[2:33:11] 8thwndrmusic: gnomer way harder than BFD
[2:33:12] simonhebo: maybe something where the more magic damage you take the less damage you take
[2:33:18] XPunchlineX: @SONII can u name 3 abilitys or passives from all the expac that would be cool as a rune?
[2:33:37] artilectXLII: ...they can always make it so warriors take % less magic-damag instead of being straight up immune; then the while-enraged thing could work
[2:33:40] xnerdstomper: warrior feels so shit that im happy when i meet a warrior in pvp - he is even worse than retpally
[2:33:53] Retsofrex: no
[2:33:53] rebronze: heroic leap? haha
[2:33:55] XPunchlineX: ye but when ur 1 shot i wont heal as much

[2:34:11] dj_efx: mop had insane hp pools tho, so the % worked
[2:34:16] XPunchlineX: it healed when u drop to 30% hp
[2:34:17] dansto10: oh yeah 3% every sec
[2:34:17] Ashlikesnows: Second wind, would be as broken as titans grip.
[2:34:18] JordaoLuke: this is why i cant trust blizzard anymore, cant warrant playing sod when theres Wallcraft available
[2:34:19] exteps: nah it was 3% every 1 sec

[2:34:27] dansto10: so 6 sec kidney was like 20% heal
[2:34:27] canty55: Second wind wont do much when you die in 3 globals
[2:34:28] DanteDPJ: DinoDance TwitchConHYPE DinoDance TwitchConHYPE DinoDance TwitchConHYPE DinoDance TwitchConHYPE
[2:34:38] wowlegendaryo: second wind healed % of hp every sec when lower than 35%

[2:38:52] xfacedx: xfacedx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[2:38:54] sovngardener: @TobbishG basically you're dead at charge

[2:39:34] HarryJPotter94: warriors are too op ngl
[2:39:38] Trybadtv: hunters are the new warrioers
[2:39:45] DeusTechnica: Sonii you're 30 now, watch your sodium levels...

[2:40:02] iiriishman88: @8thwndrmusic thats what i replied to?
[2:40:04] JerrichoTB: Warriors need more surviveability, but also more dmg, to be able to keep up with ranged - who does more dmg already....
[2:40:09] orphesis: its bad when a ranged class does better melee damage than a melee class
[2:40:12] johhnydude: show your gears soni
[2:40:19] Aka_Gami: Shoulda rolled a NE female Druid

[2:40:56] joogie: yeah warrior with all that gear at 40 was terrible Kappa
[2:40:57] madmango131313: its always next phase
[2:40:57] nelms42: Excited for gnomer?
[2:40:58] simonhebo: if warriors are stuck at lvl40 they shouldn't feel terrible, just bad design
[2:40:59] iDevox: @SONII us mages felt like that phase 1
[2:41:02] Zyphy266: im enjoying my war alt
[2:41:05] vaknah: Their vision is definitely for warriors to be sword and board.
[2:41:09] asnowgoose: I was really hoping for a hybrid ranged melee warrior build...but blizzard "creativity" went into other classes
[2:41:09] rawlexdota: Look at the bright side, the end game is ours @SONII
[2:41:09] FinestGoldy: that'll be the consistent theme. Yea next phase is so our phase
[2:41:10] ObrezKnight: @papa_squat123 3min CD?!
[2:41:11] nowheretoday: Vibe check
[2:41:11] chilemangx: maybe at level 65 they might even buff victory rush
[2:41:12] Sweenes: why is warrior so bad @sonii

[2:41:43] heroxenophanes: only class I feel like I can win all the time against
[2:41:44] iDevox: @SONII new patch notes they're nerfing starsurge by 30%
[2:41:44] azzy_dog: bro fighting for his life in pvp and everyone is saying "warriors are fine
[2:41:45] ObrezKnight: AND you have a 3min CD on it?
[2:41:47] XerisGG: they just announced boomie nerfs.

[2:41:50] ObrezKnight: I had no idea
[2:41:52] Westcoastz: dont worry even if you have warbringer they have grasp :)
[2:41:54] VanillaPete_: Starsurge getting nerfed 30% and removing the glitch that was letting it double dip on it's spell power coefficient
[2:41:55] Sinnizter: @SONII starsurge nerf though
[2:42:04] 8thwndrmusic: thats like 2 sunfires
[2:42:10] Iodobol: they are forcing u into prot
[2:42:11] nelms42: Nothing health pools are too low to make any difference with 30% needs to be buffed to healing 100% of your health over 10sec @SONII
[2:42:12] papa_squat123: they nerfed starsurge by 30% and buffed starfire by 66% LMAO
[2:42:16] frewdin: Question guys, can I get honor /  rank from Stranglethorn event?, haven't got any honor on my warrior.
[2:42:17] BackPains: boomie gets instant 30% heal from wrathing
[2:42:18] Digga17: 30% OVER 10 SECONDS
[2:42:19] Supersikness: mutilate still wrecking. chain lighting still wrecking
[2:42:21] nancypantz: All they had to do was give titans grip
[2:42:23] Garygun1: Druid can just 30 second root us as warriors. cool bio break while im rooted
[2:42:24] Whitemamba236: that doesnt fix world pvp just the event
[2:42:26] nowheretoday: Didn't make
[2:42:29] JerrichoTB: @SONII I think we just gotta enjoy the Warrior as a class, like we've always done.
[2:42:38] BackPains: true
[2:42:39] XPunchlineX: true
[2:42:44] nelms42: We would but we would have 2 more GCDS to do soemthing @SONII
[2:42:45] angryhatter: warrior needs sprint, spell reflect, a ranged spear move, ams
[2:42:47] lovelovelotsoflove: Wsg items and bracer?
[2:42:48] Trybadtv: what about ignore pain, think that would help
[2:42:49] Ashlikesnows: No. Enraged regen should be 100% but drops quickly to 30% overtime
[2:42:52] ObrezKnight: @JerrichoTB shut it, positive andy
[2:43:04] Nahno: I figured this phase would be like this, just changed mains to rogue instead :D
[2:43:05] 8thwndrmusic: 50% rage cost reduction all around
[2:43:09] Ervill1: warriors will even out in wrath/cata Kappa
[2:43:09] hajanatorator: WSG bracer?
[2:43:14] Cybershade07: They added runes but the underlying issues with classic are still there
[2:43:25] angryhatter: season of burning crusade
[2:43:26] HarryJPotter94: gachiGASM
[2:43:33] heroxenophanes: Melee hunter > war
[2:43:46] lovelovelotsoflove: Should Just play priest for now before they are nerfed
[2:43:47] 113nik: its early dnt worry
[2:43:58] VanillaPete_: Warrior double throw spec, hunters just got pure melee spec, give warriors pure ranged
[2:43:59] XPunchlineX: some deflection for spells and meele dmg for a few sec would be nice , on a dunno 20 sec cd or something
[2:43:59] JerrichoTB: @ObrezKnight I think what I just wrote was pretty negative minded :P
[2:44:05] artsakh32: who was top dps in p1?
[2:44:09] Toobak: warrior just needs double hp, more tanky and harder to kill the better chance we have
[2:44:13] sovngardener: @SONII We cant kill any paladin, shaman, priest, mage, warlock, druid specc, but we can kill warriors and rogues if the rogues playing like a dumb fuck
[2:44:19] ins0mn: they should become a hunter like class. Range warrior spec
[2:44:19] ObrezKnight: @JerrichoTB Calm down negative andy!
[2:44:22] artilectXLII: ...it will be okay, just recall how many balance-updates phase 1 had
[2:44:27] hammersuit777: all warriors need is a swifty oneshot macro
[2:44:33] 113nik: they should fix you guys now

[2:44:57] 113nik: I cant see them not addressing it
[2:44:58] Retsofrex: warriors are broken in pve, its a trouble for them to mess with pvp side without making pve even crazier

[2:47:23] joogie: how many other classes depend on an entire other character in order to be viable LUL
[2:47:25] HarryJPotter94: fax
[2:47:32] Retsofrex: warriors have always been a dominant class tbh. and warriors have ALWAYS needed a healer to do good in pvp. EXCEPT for MoP in my opinion when second wind was most broken thing in game. but i do believe warrior needs a slight buff to make them better atm in pvp at least
[2:47:33] Aka_Gami: Rant over until the next STV bloodmoon

[2:49:41] Porkypine666: with 2h
[2:49:48] krill_175: in regular season, if first team to get the ball scores a TD it wins the game in OT, in playoffs now both teams get the ball regardless
[2:49:49] dumpringz: you’re gunna miss 3/4
[2:49:50] Retsofrex: Retsofrex subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! monthly prime my friend

[2:50:18] Dukesnukem609: first to score wins

[2:50:22] krill_175: if they both score then its sudden death
[2:50:23] brumstool: next score wins after that
[2:50:27] xJ3KYLL: @Dukesnukem609 not in the playoffs
[2:50:29] dumpringz: 2h fury or arms is the play. I just did arms
[2:50:32] Ypsirc17: @Mcmackle no its not lol
[2:50:33] itma1991: they changed it
[2:50:35] gandiisawse: @RazaDazza cant have this convo until pat finishes his career
[2:50:36] Dukesnukem609: what?
[2:50:39] Dukesnukem609: thats crazy

[2:50:46] RazaDazza: @sonii they battle to the death iirc
[2:50:51] orphesis: ive thought about trying 2h fury. have you?
[2:50:53] realrednalooz: @Dukesnukem609 no
[2:50:59] Shepp22: the refs make sure that doesn’t happen
[2:51:01] Dukesnukem609: okay sorry misinformation
[2:51:03] Skrimij_: it turns into bloodbowl
[2:51:09] Skrimij_: blood bowl
[2:51:14] BackPains: its like anchor man
[2:51:37] OzmoSlice: Boomies getting nerfed tm. Currently smoking that boomie pack
[2:51:39] pew2700: This was 100% the worst scripted lol.  Its all because of Swift/Kelce... theyve made millions off of it.  I called it when it went to OT, that Chiefs would go down and score for the win and they would immediately pan the camera to Swift in the booth, which they did lol.
[2:51:41] Digga17: No
[2:51:44] Digga17: you need prequest
[2:51:50] Kyzioh: u dont need prequest
[2:51:58] papa_squat123: u dont need it, just to spawn it
[2:51:58] Kyzioh: as long as someone has trinket and can reveal the dark rider u can tag it
[2:52:07] Skrimij_: nfl became the Taylor swift cam
[2:52:11] papa_squat123: and you can do it in a raid
[2:52:16] Digga17: since when?
[2:52:16] yarrpeter: D:
[2:52:23] krill_175: Taylor swift had 54 seconds of screen time in a game that lasted almost 5 hours, just something for people to whine about honestly
[2:52:28] Marcqel: Starsurge is getting a nerf!!! read wowhead
[2:52:28] Digga17: all guides say to get the prequest
[2:52:31] Cybershade07: T Swift made the NFL $100s of millions
[2:52:37] Marcqel: They are listening to you speak
[2:52:39] jallapant: @SONII is undead warrior better than orc and tauren in sod?
[2:52:40] ObrezKnight: @Marcqel it's not gona be enough
[2:52:41] Kyzioh: i did all of the dark riders yesterday without touching the prequest
[2:52:46] NawtyTyme: 7 of them
[2:52:50] papa_squat123: it did all of them w/o trinket and in a raid
[2:52:53] Ingame: what are you using to change character model?
[2:52:59] rebronze: I believe if someone else has the sigil, you can just get it
[2:53:02] 113nik: each clas has that quest
[2:53:08] NawtyTyme: @rebronze this is true
[2:53:10] Digga17: @Kyzioh thats huge bro
[2:53:11] exequtegg: what is this rune for?
[2:53:12] blazingDrop: @Ingame imorph, try and tell me if its bannable

[2:53:35] Kyzioh: @Digga17 yeah all the turn ins net you 13g at 40 too
[2:53:39] jallapant: @SONII is undead warrior better than orc and tauren in sod?
[2:53:40] bkxo__: precise timing

[2:54:13] sovngardener: i think ill try 2h fury with slam specc once i land a decent 2hander and see if its good
[2:54:15] ObrezKnight: precise timing is gonna drain rage
[2:54:15] jallapant: oh
[2:54:25] Porkypine666: there is no slam spec
[2:54:26] Kalanarr: Precise timing is strong for pvp
[2:54:28] XPunchlineX: im a orc , but that 25% stun resist seems to be a myth lel
[2:54:32] Cybershade07: Titans grip rune would be sweet
[2:54:34] NawtyTyme: its a solid hot patch for now
[2:54:40] Aka_Gami: Buffing max HP and making heals real again will in turn make MS more valuable
[2:54:47] NawtyTyme: they said more tuning is required
[2:55:01] nowheretoday: Done any AB yet?
[2:55:01] Kyzioh: wouldnt u MS and WW over a 15 rage slam any time of the day
[2:55:07] Kyzioh: precise timing seems kinda bad
[2:55:08] NawtyTyme: hunters with get it phase 3

[2:55:22] jschroe3: damn i need that one too
[2:55:41] moby_slick: dude this song
[2:55:41] 113nik: great song
[2:55:48] orphesis: have you thought about doing a 2h fury build?
[2:55:56] Kalanarr: slam hits harder than ww and costs way less rage than ms and ww, also its a 3 damage button to press if you arent rage starved
[2:56:05] Outplayrs: just hit revered with ab, what an ass grind
[2:56:05] iDevox: THIS SONG USED TO SLAP DUDE
[2:56:26] Kalanarr: 3rd*
[2:56:46] Connor_The_Pirate: did you see creed in that paramount super bowl ad?
[2:56:48] sovngardener: @Kalanarr problem is, it aint the tbc slam - u cant queue hs and cleave and get the extra procc from sword specc, and the timer is twice as much to land it, meaning losing a lot of autoattack dmg in the process

[3:04:23] kontage: The armour values in gnomer on bosses is fked

[3:14:25] mitchp333: it seems every phase for me will be leveling warrior to see if they’re any good, then immediately go to another class to actually have fun.
[3:14:26] nelms42: I know roflamo
[3:14:27] unfaazed: @syntackx and rogue tank, mage healer, warlock tank etc
[3:14:31] deean1: warriors are always fine.. the most fine in term of how gorgeous that class is

[3:20:53] Shepp22: cs into KS dead
[3:20:53] Valkyurios: @SONII idk if its considered good reasoning or not, but warriors might just suck in pvp because they excel in pve and devs prob dont want them being top in both
[3:20:58] ShaneiumTheCranium: My vote is Shaman, but hey
[3:21:02] VanillaPete_: Warrior will be just fine in PvE once we get our gnomer gear, pvp we just use charge/intercept to stun them for the better classes with us LUL
[3:21:03] bronchoped1: @kpaxlol no
[3:21:17] lilkreamys: fair
[3:21:18] Skyrian: any interest in trying hunter @SONII

[3:22:15] Ddocz: @rexxarhero4 I thought it was pretty cool

[3:24:21] Digga17: Its as good as it sounds
[3:24:24] Shepp22: I wonder if teams will consider not bringing a warrior to AB. if everything is going to be a one shot ranged fest then bring priests with bubble
[3:24:27] VanillaPete_: CRAZY mediocre
[3:24:28] nowheretoday: That's a 2h rune no?
[3:24:30] 113nik: instantly turns you into a s priest

[3:27:07] Ashlikesnows: they should of gave us spell reflect KEKW to deal with those cancer casters
[3:27:13] XPunchlineX: @moby_slick both got nerfed and due to high armor in gnome u dont generate that much rage to sit at 80
[3:27:27] xitera: ive tried to typw without watch LUL
[3:27:28] VanillaPete_: wrath marksmanship hunter with all armor pen gems KEKW

[3:29:51] popitforchrist: i need to see
[3:29:57] smokednz: how are warr tanks in gnomer?
[3:30:03] trey_15: im out of the loop of sod, is gnomer the phase 2 raid?
[3:30:11] XPunchlineX: yes
[3:30:13] VanillaPete_: didn't they buff devastate, so 1 button warrior got better?
[3:30:18] VanillaPete_: top parsing as warrior tank LUL
[3:30:18] danishdezzak: I also find it weird that warriors dont get any tanking help, we still feel like classic while shamans just use 1 ability and have aggro from everything, if thundering fury did just atleast uncap the amount of targets you could it, it would be somewhat good, but we have NO chance of tanking multiple mobs, so slowly we lose the ´tanking role as well... feels bad man
[3:30:25] alphatitan411: Hey @SONII is your guild recruiting?
[3:30:31] XPunchlineX: they nerfed deva as far as i know
[3:30:51] th4les: yeah KEKW

[3:31:08] ShaneiumTheCranium: Molten Blast is honestly wild.  Its the ability all tanks arguably need, but dont get it.
[3:31:11] bronchoped1: Tanking feels shit as you can't get enough rage due to massive armour on bosses
[3:31:11] nowheretoday: All planned
[3:31:16] scrunchy_: They will balance classes guys it's only been out 3 day
[3:31:19] papa_squat123: We have to wait 6+ months to be "good" again. GG Bliz
[3:31:20] danishdezzak: im not rerolling, ive always played warrior and i'd rather quit again than play something else, its just not my cup of tea
[3:31:21] Cybershade07: Balance in all things
[3:31:23] mitchp333: warriors have no proper role, they aren’t the best at anything anymore.
[3:31:33] Misazhi: @scrunchy_ LUL
[3:31:34] AboveAverageApe: Does warrior suck or something rn?
[3:31:40] XPunchlineX: yep
[3:31:46] Aka_Gami: Warriors in vanilla: We suck 1-59 so we deserve this.  Warriors in SOD: We sucked all the first phases so we deserve this

[3:41:33] Zecxx: I think its a reference to the pvp event where you get sheeped for a min until debuff falls off
[3:42:00] oleTut: fury pops off

[3:42:56] XPunchlineX: u dont have the attack power to 2h fury
[3:43:00] Porkypine666: arms is best intro spec to raid
[3:43:07] TrueBlueGlue: lol awesome
[3:43:08] Aka_Gami: i guess depends how much utility you get out of sweeping strikes for gnomer
[3:43:10] ShaneiumTheCranium: Maybe a dumb question but isnt there something to be said about being in a niche place?  Like, I assume Warrs are still mad strong in PVE raid scenarios but bad in PVP.  I feel like other classes dont excel in pve but are alright at pvp?
[3:43:10] nowheretoday: Pop deathwish and get one shot lol

[4:59:28] bronchoped1: @p_fet  lava burst requires flame shock. Which is a low range spell. Then you have to cast LB. Not even in the same realm as instant cast starsurge

[5:00:30] tygore106: i feel like shadow word death should do the same dmg to priest if he doesnt kill the target
[5:00:31] p_fet: @bronchoped1 it hits harder than any other spell stop kidding urself, ur next on the chopping block

[5:04:25] D3KHAR: OMEGALUL
[5:04:31] CorkeLoL: no hunters are lawl
[5:04:40] bronchoped1: @bball0928 of course. Warrior will still scale to the top. That's not the issue though
[5:05:00] bahsingha: do you have 3 healers?
[5:05:02] itsPerkii: remember to watch the feet of this boss. Watching hands can be confusing as to what way he is facing on the knockback
[5:05:05] bball0928: @bronchoped1 what’s the issue you’re referring to?
[5:05:10] XPunchlineX: more prio than rota
[5:05:13] Abr0dolflincl3r: feral si fun
[5:05:16] BrotherDanTV: @SONII Later bosses have more armour than lvl 60 bosses apparently reducing physical dmg by as much as 45%, supposedly should be getting looked into
[5:05:17] itsPerkii: oh shit
[5:05:19] bronchoped1: Nothing fun/new. No flashy shit like the rest

[6:23:36] BroccoliTom: leave sonii ALONE, leave him ALONE

[6:26:50] SjayGG: channeling ravager in ST is not worth it , right?
[6:26:50] Awezmoe: nag ranged need to figure out bombs
[6:26:50] Porkypine666: this fight is so hard without optimal class

[6:28:23] BrotherDanTV: Bombs explode tho don't be near them
[6:28:27] Donacheron: let ranged kill the bombs
[6:28:37] itsPerkii: the druid in the raid I was in earlier was one shotting the bombs with moonfire. They only have 150 health
[6:28:44] Donacheron: ranged should kill em no one else
[6:28:48] Donacheron: they explode
[6:28:56] kdayrit: whoever did a button cant press another button for 25 seconds
[6:29:05] Donacheron: 150hp no need to slow
[6:29:08] BrotherDanTV: If you have that many ranged in your grp and they can't do 159dmg to each bomb, it's hopeless bud
[6:29:09] kdayrit: someone new has to press the button to close the bomb door
[6:29:15] PippTheKid: is willy enh or ele?
[6:29:20] Donacheron: yep the button which spawns the boms

[6:33:40] ShaneiumTheCranium: I can do 77 in 2 minutes dude.  Its not difficult.
[6:34:25] vepsee: @iPlayCuzFun considering basic military PT for the US is like 45 pushups in 2 minutes minimum 100 should be fairly easy in 10
[6:34:31] nowheretoday: soniiOMG
[6:34:36] Porkypine666: ppl saying this isnt hard arent memeing lol
[6:34:39] Godof4play18: have to dispell each stack

[6:34:58] iPlayCuzFun: @vepsee i can do 45 in 2 min but i cant do 100 in 10 min, guess the endurance kills me
[6:34:59] Godof4play18: soppressotta is fire on pizza
[6:35:01] Porkypine666: fap works for moving through the frost
[6:35:06] Lukeker: dispell is too much mana, fights too long, just need proper fap usage
[6:35:06] vepsee: you fap right before the big cast ends and it'll last for 2 full casts
[6:35:07] Porkypine666: not for clearing stacks
[6:35:08] WcWillow: individual and can cast on others
[6:35:20] wolfaloned: put shado pri on that phase to dispell only
[6:35:20] PackTV_: MrDestructoid
[6:35:22] wolfaloned: he can get mana back
[6:35:23] wolfaloned: ez
[6:35:34] wolfaloned: dont use healers to dispell

[6:44:47] MeerTwT: he got 10stacks frozen and instadead
[6:44:50] iheartmywife: @SONII the boss's smash does more damage for each slow stack on the raid
[6:44:51] bronchoped1: No bomb should ever touch middle
[6:45:01] iheartmywife: if people fap right before he drops charges its a huge help

[6:55:59] jimbonni: SP
[6:56:01] inspect4: Our shadow did 250 on this boss
[6:56:02] ayaooazz: doing the mechanics is more important on this fight tho
[6:56:05] nowheretoday: Thought he was gonna do better ngl
[6:56:07] journeygaming3: Thoughts on Gnomer? Seems hard for a 40 raid
[6:56:14] Pietruth: aoe or single target?
[6:56:20] Brutelite: The way you guys do P2 nwo with frost you need the nature resist prot pots in P3
[6:56:24] Brutelite: but they share a CD
[6:56:24] Porkypine666: still learning the fight, dont judge them ><
[6:56:28] ratheonn: honestly on single target shadow priest should be much higher
[6:56:43] jimbonni: but we had a lock so not sure
[6:56:47] Shepp22: no mindflay
[6:56:48] nowheretoday: Does he even runes lol

[6:57:12] brownfiesta: LOL 40 faps
[6:57:20] LankyHanky: or we can get better gear and try later
[6:57:21] Fierceee: 40, lmao. Like 25g
[6:57:22] Brutelite: Why are you using FAPs now that you assign a person to a pillar and no bombs get through?
[6:57:26] RyanRulz: probably not trying to do death to help heals
[6:57:33] jimbonni: meybey go 2H furry bru
[6:57:43] jimbonni: its singel boss fight so
[6:57:44] rUpsuuu: show again sp detail, let us discuss

[6:57:52] inspect4: Check healing done
[6:57:57] Iol69: 60s each rough
[6:58:01] jupitor24: does the shadow priest have mind spike?
[6:58:02] Hardstylez78: So is arms viable?
[6:58:10] jimbonni: it is bro
[6:58:11] RyanRulz: @jupitor24 yes
[6:58:16] jimbonni: all bosses have cleavee
[6:58:25] jimbonni: only last boss is singel mostly
[6:58:26] EmpurityTV: maybe put the spriest into melee grp for VE
[6:58:38] Slesky: @SONII Bosses have massive amounts of Armor, Physical DPS have a tough time. Each boss has 4k base armor. Casters should be blasting though
[6:58:41] logic__: progression raiding baby
[6:58:50] Porkypine666: guarantee this fight gets giga nerfed soon
[6:59:11] vepsee: 250-300

[6:59:20] Pietruth: KEKW dps isnt ur prob
[6:59:23] keknrekt: 200+
[6:59:28] WcWillow: ours was less than that
[6:59:30] tylersquareee: NOT ENOUGH CASTERS
[6:59:31] bakedkayke: 150 dps KEKW
[6:59:32] dflo: just getting comfortable with mechanics
[6:59:35] Huxi_Mont: dmg is whack cause people aren't comfortable on the fight
[6:59:35] lequani: s priest specially low
[6:59:36] Jon_GamesTV: I just watch Savix group and your DPS is better over all
[6:59:36] Iol69: i just watched payos raid and they were doing like 150-250
[6:59:38] keknrekt: no one does 300 and mechanics
[6:59:39] inspect4: 300 on this boss is like 100 parse
[6:59:41] Donacheron: 200plus casters
[6:59:46] Donacheron: meele less
[6:59:59] Donacheron: true
[7:00:00] Donacheron: it isnt
[7:00:09] re5onxnce: need more mechanics
[7:00:09] Porkypine666: @MeerTwT not for casuals, which is their target audience in SOD

[7:01:13] Porkypine666: 2h fury does not sim better than arms

[7:07:36] jeff0154567: don’t stand in the fire !!!!!!

[7:17:21] kissg00dbye: understandable
[7:17:24] 777zs: switch out of ms

[7:17:37] Pietruth: KEKW dps isnt ur prob
[7:17:39] Porkypine666: wrong
[7:17:44] xitera: Is this 5th atempt?
[7:17:46] MrHoffo: @SONII how many tries so far? just curious <3
[7:17:49] MeerTwT: can u show healing as well soni pleae
[7:17:51] Porkypine666: #1 warrior is arms
[7:17:53] LeCrainke: hey sonii , how much hp does your tank have ? just wondering if im goood for gnomer
[7:17:54] MeerTwT: I wanna check something
[7:18:06] MeerTwT: yep
[7:18:07] stympler: dont forget repairs
[7:18:11] 777zs: @Porkypine666 correct but cruelty impale and axe spec would be better
[7:18:12] MeerTwT: his dropping embrace aswell
[7:18:21] MeerTwT: his heal should be almost more then healers
[7:18:28] bilass_: ohhh the red gear, so sad to see
[7:18:29] nowheretoday: Mind blast>swd>mind spike>swp
[7:18:29] MeerTwT: if his uptime on embrace will be higher
[7:18:37] Porkypine666: @777zs factually wrong
[7:18:52] MeerTwT: yes
[7:19:01] MeerTwT: its smal
[7:19:05] Porkypine666: you get enough gear from quests to stack crit before you even get in raid
[7:19:26] bronchoped1: Its not dps that's the issue. It's bomb management
[7:19:28] damarlybo: @SONII  can you show healing done for a sec?
[7:20:07] MeerTwT: shadow weaving is better from what I saw and if u have 90+ uptime on embrace u pass healers on metters aswell
[7:20:15] MeerTwT: 90%
[7:20:45] insanity_233: im so hyped shadow is gonna be nuts at 60
[7:21:03] inspect4: We ran 2 sps 1 holy and holy was 3rd
[7:21:03] Porkypine666: if sonii had STV mace, 2h fury would be okay but w/o it the difference is marginal
