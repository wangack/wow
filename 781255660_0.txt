[1:04:20] Aphro_Samurai: " /cast [@layer] starfall "
[1:04:28] NewWorldReign: What was Headless Horseman like when he was first put in WoW? @Towelliee

[1:05:00] Puns_Blazing: starfall now always casts around you, and "sticks" to you
[1:05:00] sylverdrake_: starfall now casts on you
[1:05:05] wopplefrag: there's 0 reason to have a starfall macro now
[1:05:14] NewWorldReign: several times
[1:05:17] king_julian_96: Hey Towelliee how long do you think we have till the prepatch event
[1:05:17] Puns_Blazing: yeah, people wipe when everyone is a dps spec
[1:05:19] xerberuzxz: yes
[1:05:23] Bel_Daeva: I wiped - Tanking on my Druid, and everyone else was level 10.
[1:05:24] wopplefrag: besides a cancel SL starfall macro but you dont need to worry bout that
[1:05:24] RogueBear: the problem with boomie is that with enough targets its more dps to cap out your AP and spam starfire if you have enough targets stacked during lunar. once you have starfall up its not worth pressing again till the buff is gone
[1:05:25] merrycrest: yeah healer was a dps
[1:05:26] geokouts: once or twice but was years ago
[1:05:27] Colt_Engineer: that shit urks me
[1:05:27] honeychonker: trouble is people queueing as tank and heals
[1:05:29] vonblue: yep especially when u don't get a healer
[1:05:29] NewWorldReign: only good thing abut dying here is your just at the door lo
[1:05:30] Clicklesly: I did once in 3rd phase with some weird group ^^

[1:12:24] Menion01: Scourge event is 2 weeks. I doubt they would announce the new launch date that close.

[1:31:41] Norbi33: dreanor was the best.. just ppl are salty because someone made a meme its bad because the garrison
[1:31:41] Biming: I started playing WoW once prepatch started and damn I have been enjoying, and I do agree WoD has been the smoothest leveling experience so far.
[1:31:41] BlindFaithFuel: Blizz wanted to make people rethink their thoughts of it yeah
[1:31:42] Jeddek_: The questing/leveling experience in WoD was fine. It was the rest of the expac that blew major dick
[1:31:49] th30dor: Thats because its best exp. Nerf that, and make cataclysm best exp, and then cataclysm is new bff
[1:31:57] PadidinJones: Making Dreanor great again
[1:31:58] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Well if back then Draenor had some decent systems and not being in your garrison all day it would have been great
[1:32:00] rivera9: GULDAN DID NOTHING WRONG
[1:32:01] M3rlOH: outland the goat

[1:33:10] Norbi33: i feel like love rocket are the hardest..
[1:33:11] th30dor: @BigD530 didnt play it, but my understanding is that what content was there was good, but it was very little. Essentially nothing to do
[1:33:14] Frankenclyde: whos the love rocket drop from
[1:33:14] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee did you get time walking first try?
[1:33:16] Eshel: Let’s be honest ... Draenor wasn’t bad play-wise .... the story turned it into a shit show
[1:33:18] Villie: How many characters do you plan to have for the love rocket? 50 per day?
[1:33:18] KingSlayerYotam: @Towelliee are you questing or just do bonus objective?
[1:33:47] WoW_StandalonE: 50-60 will take the same time as 1-50

[1:40:44] Fhirn: oculus best dungeon ever Kappa

[1:42:50] Clicklesly: That's can still be DMCAd though? Cause the songs are over 100, but the performance is probably new
[1:42:54] BrowneePoints: @Crazdmadman nope. Classical can't be dmca'd
[1:42:57] Eshel: Public domain is your friend :)
[1:43:18] Bugszy: dude i was watching one streasmer and she is like oh really i need to delete them all lol
[1:43:23] xmedpakx: can you play WoW music?
[1:43:26] BrowneePoints: It's your big burst CD
[1:43:34] Crazdmadman: @BrowneePoints the music is public domain, the performance isnt
[1:43:44] Germcb2005: single - wrath, lunar - aoe
[1:43:44] Villie: It’s just a cooldown
[1:43:48] xmedpakx: wrath and lunar
[1:43:49] honeychonker: Starfall only hits things you're in combat with
[1:43:50] meady: imagine being born with a gift to sing and then dmca someone for spreading your voice LUL
[1:43:54] parallellevel: starfall only hit mobs that are in combat
[1:44:26] BrowneePoints: @Crazdmadman the performance cannot be dmca'd unless the arrangement is significantly altered from the original score. Source: I'm a freaking Orchestral Clarinetist
[1:44:44] meady: wtf LUL
[1:44:52] Zettabyte: that's fucked up
[1:44:59] Bugszy: can he really - that makes no sense
[1:45:00] snorrow92: if he is under a label and the label got the rights?
[1:45:02] Clicklesly: The Dragonforce guy was DMCAs for his own music and apparently the company still owes him money for the rights ^^
[1:45:06] MetalManGG: seen a couple of twitch musicians getting DMCA'd for playing their own tracks
[1:45:06] Stradivarii: Probably because the label owns it?
[1:45:09] MarquisLek: dmca = guilty until proven innocent
[1:45:30] ReverendBey: That has happened to AKAMikeB.
[1:45:34] DropKickLippy: imagine not being able to listen to yourself
[1:45:35] Seresin: @Towelliee build up to 90 AP, pop CD, then 3x uber Starsurges, then fill with buffed wrath
[1:45:39] Venkxx: the problem is, the artists themselves don't file the dmca claims, some random lawyers do
[1:45:45] meady: I'm feeling rough this morning I drank a litre of bombay saphire gin last night urgh
[1:45:48] BrowneePoints: @Towelliee Remember John Fogerty got sued for sounding like himself(the lead singer for CCR) after he went solo
[1:45:52] MarquisLek: because the algorithims prefer overfitting to underfitting

[1:45:55] Noshpan: I've seen it happen to Danny Barronowsky
[1:45:56] Stradivarii: Didnt taylor Swifts old label retain the full rights to her earlier stuff?
[1:45:58] RogueBear: theres a lot of dumb musicians and bands out there that dont realize they gave away the rights to their music when they signed their contract
[1:46:01] Bel_Daeva: A lot of the DMCA being automatic though - The artist then has to file a counterclaim to fight it.
[1:46:07] WhoSaidObeya: Think Monstercat got DMCA? Kappa
[1:46:07] Sadisticmedic: Mike Sinoda of Linkin Park was almost DMCA
[1:46:17] Folkja: in Germany the GEMA can get the right to represent you without you agreeing to it explicitly. It's a default that the artist has to opt out of.
[1:46:18] Tripnbunz: under record labels you dont own your music the label does talk to panda he better informed
[1:46:24] NewWorldReign: so even if you listen to a song from a dead singer, thats still a DMCA?
[1:46:26] Eshel: I mean .... all this shit is the reason Prince changed his name to a symbol ........
[1:46:37] BigD530: Lvl 11 with fullHeirloom set?
[1:46:40] Clicklesly: Probably still learning the char and all

[1:46:50] Ez_a_szomoru: !time-lost
[1:46:51] MarquisLek: people die, copyrights don't
[1:46:53] snorrow92: @NewWorldReign of course, the rights are still owned to someone like a music label
[1:46:55] DropKickLippy: no Michael Jackson rip
[1:47:02] Seresin: either the label or the estate could
[1:47:06] Villie: Most artist don’t own Thier music LUL
[1:47:11] shrektard69: lol
[1:47:14] ReverendBey: If an artist is registered with the RIAA it is the RIAA that issues the DMCA.
[1:47:18] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Well Mozzart and Bethoven died and you dont get DMCA for their music Kappa
[1:47:20] LPCSparc: a lot of these bs © / DMCA 'tools' are automated; so I could believe someone getting DMCAd for their own work
[1:47:21] Nessman6: anyone have issue with timewalk levelling? I picked wrath for my do ( levelled through wrath back in the day on this character but I don't have any of the achievements for completing the story through the zones) anyway I go to the point of interest quest mark on my map and there isn't anything there. no quests

[1:47:41] firefly_on: enough with the dmca already zzzz
[1:47:43] NewWorldReign: Who say I listen to Michael Jackson?

[2:44:51] sainnt757: IT's funny that all the potential revenue that could have earned from Spotify and people discovering new tracks from streamers is going to deteriorate. Than they are going to be like "what happened"..

[2:45:47] th30dor: it's a management failure. They could have prioritised building those tools. Instead they prioritized channel points. Goes to show

[5:42:57] SRDraven: Best spec for leveling DK?
[5:43:17] MrGattz: feral is fun but its not worth it. its very difficult to play and the dps output for the amount of work input isnt worth it to someone who doesnt enjoy the class

[5:50:34] TordsGaming: so what's faster for leveling ? questing or dungeon spam. Did 16 hours on my DK from 15 to 50 spamming dungeons as tank. :)
[5:50:38] RuneMeisterKris: @royhandlesit Same. He said he was in college and just really liked the distraction
[5:50:39] datcreepa: I mean he would know about the shadowlands
[5:50:40] Drogdorf: he is a shit wizard
[5:50:45] tulwinn: It makes sense, we were being idiots and fighting each other

[5:51:25] jiffynuts: He’s trying to move Dalaran back but needs a pickmeupper
[5:51:29] vylh: it was something about him going to Kara tho
[5:51:41] Xehanort1986: @Towelliee 8.2 Wrathion went to Karazhan to read some books, yet he doesnt encounter Khadgar :o
[5:51:43] PadidinJones: Seriously, Medivh even called him the Guardian
[5:51:46] vylh: Reading books takes a while when youre a shit wizard
[5:51:48] cedemusic: knowledge (of where khadgar is) is power
[5:51:48] TrowGundam: It is mentioned by Wrathion when he talks about the elixier or whatever he got from Kara to fight off the old god corruption

[6:18:41] PhrykeFinn: They've been nerfing the shit out of the soulbinds
[6:18:52] Menion01: I think SL would be fine if Soulbinds were per spec. That would make off-specs viable again.
