[2:12:41] oshiyi999: frost nova blink away flamestrike blizzard
[2:12:52] DakuiOG: living bomb will make the nova break and they will hit you while casting
[2:12:52] oshiyi999: nova will break but it lets u do ur DoT!!!
[2:13:00] oshiyi999: and blizzard slow keeps them in flamestrike

[7:51:30] dragoon_wow: i really wish they would revert the pvp trinket.  allowing ppl to trinket everything heavily favors certain classes.  its necessary for arena, but vanilla style wpvp and BGs isnt arena.
[7:52:11] Elijahss: keking
[7:52:13] Str4nge_DejaVu: No, it was only Fear, Sleep & Charm
[7:52:14] dragoon_wow: @DesiHeat no, vanilla has unique trinkets for each class.
[7:52:35] dragoon_wow: @DesiHeat its not fine, desi.  the trinket changes hurts hunters for example and buffs warlocks.  its too unfair of a change
[7:52:48] Renfuryy: the first trinket we had is what hes talking about
[7:52:51] jimbology: standard vanilla trinkets are class based, and break different things
[7:52:53] Zefior: this is not vanilla
[7:52:55] Arthident: apeJam

[7:53:05] Renfuryy: it didnt work on everything yes
[7:53:05] Fossabot: apeJam
[7:53:15] dragoon_wow: @DesiHeat ok so.. if u can trinket out of a freezing trap, it really really hurts the hunter.  if u trinket a fear, the lock can recast fear. it doesnt decimate the lock
[7:53:29] Ezzx: class based = every class can trinket different things, its not one trinket for every cc like wotlk is
[7:53:55] Renfuryy: look at what I linked you
[7:53:57] glutenrich69: some trinkets only cleared slow and root and some did stun etc
[7:54:35] Renfuryy: being stuck in 30 second polys and 30 second saps sucked
[7:54:41] siggysudzz: Sounds like a skill issue
[7:54:47] Elijahss: This is SoD so I prefer the change
[7:54:55] Zefior: people get 2 shots by some classes what they are describing is the last thing sod needs
