[5:18:18] Auphyr: desi vibe lidsy0Bingus
[5:18:27] Elijahss: I put a bunch of extra work into getting plate(extra armor), extra stam, retricutioner enchant to absorb 9 dmg per hit and defense for this fight.  3 items I only wear for tanking him, bc he just hits hard af.
[5:20:12] Lanepin: Heals are lackin hard

[5:21:15] ill3stdrew: i need a beer
[5:21:20] nickas31: roll a priest?
[5:21:21] Lanepin: Whats this with mage healers lol
[5:21:40] ballerdeluxe: mage healer is about doing your rotation well, not wasting mana on extra beaons, getting off casts
[5:21:41] Pyroheet: maybe becuase we doing more dps?
[5:21:49] thejawnny: mage heals are good
[5:21:55] cosmin284: NODDERS
[5:21:59] Renfuryy: gremlinNODDERS mage are half heal half dps, they wont ever come near a priest
[5:22:07] ballerdeluxe: also batching is huge on mage healer
[5:22:12] lucaalfb: the priest can solo heal this boss :D take out all bombs its no dmg race
[5:22:14] nickas31: yeah a mage healer should never main heal
[5:22:31] Elijahss: You guys are progging imo
[5:22:32] ataii: rogue top dps MONKA
[5:22:50] nickas31: commanding shout?
[5:22:55] nickas31: whats rallying?
[5:22:56] Lanepin: Is the meta going in mage healers only?
[5:23:17] nickas31: yall have shadow priest?
[5:23:34] thejawnny: dps looks kinda low tbh
[5:23:50] Renfuryy: checking logs, Phyr did 48% of my healing (and hes doing it the right way)
[5:23:54] Renfuryy: on that fight
[5:24:16] DesiHeat: monkeChat

[5:24:26] Elijahss: Stick some HoTs on the tank for sure
[5:24:34] Pyroheet: @Renfuryy but the different we are doing way more dmg the phase wont last much
[5:24:36] Lanepin: Zeromonkebiz

[5:28:15] DesiHeat: fuegoYay
[5:29:07] Elijahss: yeah, melee has to be rly careful around him.  Even I try as the OT bc I don't want to take any extra dmg.  Never stand in front of him and care is need when he isnt being tanked in  place.
[5:29:51] Lanepin: Whats going wrong with this?
