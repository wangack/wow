[0:11:02] aliceimpala: inksy looking futch
[0:11:07] BoogiePonderosa: "you got a permit for that mount?..."
[0:11:41] Zhenedra: Did you say wigcraft or witchcraft :-P

[0:13:39] LouOfc: Are there any benefits from doing the digs in a group?
[0:13:42] Ujai321: ahhhhh, tldr. good times.
[0:14:03] Kurama__95: People say doing SL mission tables for pet charms is still good gold, but I hate how long it takes to sell pets on the AH LUL
[0:14:04] Kaseyfullofjoy: Ugg. Sadly it's possible basically via hours in zereth mortis
[0:14:12] Perkolate: woah who would afk those...
[0:14:26] winniepixx: oh i dont even know what these digs are, where to do them and what they are for...i must have been sleeping under a rock NotLikeThis

[0:14:48] goplacidly56: hazelWave
[0:15:00] Ujai321: there will probably be something to buy eventually
[0:15:30] Lunarphor: freed from the halls of origination
[0:15:37] Ujai321: i cannot believe they named it "the big dig"
[0:16:11] winniepixx: ahhhh nice one, thanks Hazel <3
[0:16:33] Ujai321: it SOUNDED right up their alley, but they renamed the love rocket, for example
[0:16:34] Kretyn: @ujai321 to be fair, it makes more sense than ‚Äúsolo self found‚Äù or whatever weird name they‚Äôre giving it
[0:17:48] jgbrit: I thought it was solo self fund? üòï
[0:17:59] sence_00: its doent work on alts
[0:18:02] Ujai321: it sure is something you can do for 10 minutes
[0:18:04] eielwind: 731g isnt bad either :D
[0:18:04] sence_00: sadly
[0:18:06] Ujai321: you know. for science
[0:18:13] sence_00: oh no you just get gold and stuff instead
[0:18:27] Catebot: I did it on alts
[0:18:27] anker_jym: Hazel, do you have a Demon Hunter? How do you feel about them.
[0:18:30] sence_00: haha ya exactly! I made that mistake
[0:18:33] Ujai321: the price of science
[0:18:36] Catebot: but thats why I didnt wanna haha
[0:18:37] Kurama__95: I'm doing only on my main cuz of the rep, once I max it out then I'll leave an alt just for digs
[0:18:48] anker_jym: Sure!
[0:19:09] cashthb: what if the real the reward is not the mod/ount but the msterious fragments you made along the way?
[0:19:18] anker_jym: Thanks! I totally forgot about him lol
[0:19:19] Ujai321: he's may have the moves, but he doesnt have a shirt
[0:19:30] amaya21: how's the weather now hazel?
[0:19:41] averageteacup: I have night elf demon hunter with same hair color, named him Ronny :D
[0:19:58] ancester: I'm taking this time to do a missing / love critter achievment in draenor
[0:20:09] AjaxGamingTTV: It's already raining on the mainland/
[0:20:11] Ujai321: man, i just like how big themounts are as a dracthyr
[0:20:39] AjaxGamingTTV: The snow is turning to ice now
[0:20:42] Kurama__95: I'm yet to try out the new soar
[0:20:52] eielwind: i forgot Soar was dragonriding now and it caught me off guard earlier
[0:20:59] GreenArrowed: it's still snowing here. the sun was out early this morning now it's whiteout
[0:21:18] cashthb: but were they scary?
[0:21:45] IndigoCat: lol, poor puppy
[0:22:11] Hippwn: Is he much of a snow eater
[0:22:12] Ujai321: free sticks? in this economy??
[0:22:29] Ryok: in my 34 years alive i don't think i've ever built a snowman D:
[0:22:55] Ujai321: so how often do you have "Do you want to build a snowman" from Frozen in your head these days?
[0:23:09] Timetaco: @HazelNuttyGames Good morning! Question: I haven't played since DF launch, in your opinion, is the game in a good state for a player with limited time?
[0:23:24] sence_00: its just a Canadian compulsion
[0:23:30] Ryok: yeah as kid there was snow every winter the last 15 or so years it's been every 3-4 years or so, and most of the time it's not even enough for one
[0:23:45] GreenArrowed: i've managed to never see frozen
[0:23:50] LKatey75: we can't get to our backyard after the snow gets more than a foot
[0:23:58] BoogiePonderosa: i hate when the grass and dirt gets all rolled up along w/ the snow :D
[0:24:08] sence_00: have you done any outland cup? thats my go-to for in between digs
[0:24:15] Ujai321: it's a fine movie
[0:24:23] amaya21: let it go :P
[0:24:27] Hippwn: That into the unknown song from the 2nd movie is actually really cool
[0:24:32] mcxoney: whats your favorite disney movie?
[0:24:42] ancester: i have watched it so many times with my daughter that i know most of the lines of frozen 2
[0:24:52] Ujai321: oh right, you wanted to rewatch Coco
[0:25:33] Ujai321: did you watch it till the end?
[0:25:41] BoogiePonderosa: my daughter loved the first Frozen but by the time sequel was made she'd aged out of any interest
[0:25:52] LKatey75: oh! I'm so excited, I'm getting a new viola today!
[0:25:55] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[0:25:59] Ryok: lion king for me üëÄ coco is probably my favorite recent one... tbf i haven't seen many in recent years xD
[0:26:07] cashthb: maybe people cry 'cause they really dislike it
[0:26:20] LKatey75: replacing one I've had since high school that is a brick to play
[0:26:40] amaya21: anastasia
[0:26:51] Ujai321: i rewatched The Little Mermaid like 2 years ago, and ho boy, did i not remember how that movie ended
[0:26:59] BoogiePonderosa: VHS days-- back when the vault MEANT something!  LUL
[0:27:07] witchhobbit: one of my fav disney movies was the black cauldron lol
[0:27:18] witchhobbit: also sword and the stone
[0:27:24] mcxoney: i really liked aristocats
[0:27:31] LKatey75: I'm about 15 years out of practice, amazing how much muscle memory one can keep though
[0:27:32] Ujai321: that sounds like a very plausible dream
[0:27:43] cashthb: maybe you should do trumpet streams
[0:28:01] Ujai321: nah, trumpet streams... blow
[0:28:30] ancester: havent been able to fill tasks in a raid group
[0:28:31] sence_00: I showed my husband the Aristocats recently and he's been singing 'Scales and Arpeggios' non-stop since...its been months
[0:28:35] ancester: on that event
[0:29:06] witchhobbit: i just really enjoy the old disney movies because of the animation style was the most appealing to me
[0:29:12] Ujai321: have you tried using the interact key in real life yet
[0:29:49] Ujai321: nothing, really. it would just be nice to have an interact key in real life
[0:29:54] zlinda95: Helloo again!
[0:29:58] Catebot: Interact saved me when my herbs started running from me
[0:30:01] cashthb: they peak at the emperors new grove
[0:30:05] komolana: @Ujai321 sounds like me motivating myself to go to the shop lol
[0:30:07] witchhobbit: princess and the frog is one of the best princess ones
[0:31:10] Ujai321: oh, so you have slept really well today?
[0:31:19] cashthb: I could eat it
[0:31:48] Zuldak: corn cak
[0:31:48] Piktorr: Wait where is this event happening?
[0:31:50] Zuldak: cake*
[0:31:55] GreenArrowed: it's too fussy
[0:31:58] GreenArrowed: AP is fine
[0:32:15] BoogiePonderosa: found out last night if you click Greymane enough times, he'll say a quote from Pulp Fiction
[0:32:20] Perkolate: LUL
[0:32:20] ghostie1995: ohh I have to tell my partner this. he likes learning cool facts
[0:32:21] Ujai321: yep, that tracks
[0:33:06] Silverkitty: wow insane stream
[0:33:07] Ujai321: did you automate the Satisfactory bread?
[0:33:31] Ryok: speaking of disney... when i was 16 or so i was doing an unpaid intern ship through school in a grocery store and they had PS2s on sale, so the owner told me "if you do well i'll give you a PS2 as payment" i worked my butt off... he gave me a dvd of disneys anastasia D:
[0:34:14] Silverkitty: tbh what is this event your doing rn and should i also be doing it?
[0:34:19] eielwind: taht is certainly *not* a PS2
[0:34:20] CurrentsWoW: Sadge no ps2 :(
[0:34:27] Silverkitty: fashion is the MOST important thing to me
[0:34:27] Ujai321: i dont hink Anastasia is Disney?
[0:34:29] conksalot: I wasn't watching the stream yesterday... But I was the Worgen Druid you landed next in Gilneas yesterday! /wave
[0:34:38] keyboardturner: as far as i've seen there's been nothing that unlocks with higher rep?
[0:34:40] Ryok: @CurrentsWoW you can't imagine how pissed i was D:
[0:34:42] keyboardturner: and nothing is rep-lcoekd yet
[0:34:43] Silverkitty: that backpack is insane
[0:34:43] Shrenko: oh my god she looks amazing
[0:34:45] Rumple8eanskin: Glasses hide the flashlight eyes
[0:35:13] Shrenko: I couldnt relate to your title more... gotta collect it all üòî
[0:35:15] Silverkitty: how do i dig?
[0:35:16] Ryok: @Ujai321 oh it's not? well... animation movie from 20+ years ago... same stuff
[0:35:26] Ujai321: they are also, to be a pedant, really cool
[0:35:29] Catebot: there are two that you can get from digs that look great
[0:35:47] Silverkitty: tyty
[0:35:48] Zuldak: the wowhead guide said it doesnt rotate, its always here but that seems weird
[0:35:49] Shrenko: how do you keep your bags so clean?
[0:36:01] forebringer: man being in a shard with a group sucks get one task
[0:36:15] CurrentsWoW: wonder if this is them officially giving up on archeology as it once was
[0:36:21] Ryok: @Ujai321 googled it and back then it wasn't a disney movie... but it's now owned by disney so it is now xD
[0:36:31] Ujai321: @Shrenko vigilance and determination
[0:36:33] cashthb: why wouldn't they
[0:36:39] Silverkitty: "why would they not just stick a vendor here" youre sounding like a pvper now
[0:36:48] Zuldak: im reputation 2 with the archivists and i gotnothing
[0:36:55] Ryok: i've been digging this whole dig... and i've NOT gotten a single task D:
[0:37:01] Shrenko: I just race changed my dwarf to a gnome... I have lost it
[0:37:03] forebringer: Ive only gotten 3 green tomes when I normally get 8 mixed
[0:37:06] Silverkitty: the golden era
[0:37:14] CurrentsWoW: that's when HazelAfterDark comes back
[0:37:25] CurrentsWoW: 92% in 5 days
[0:37:44] Ujai321: that's not even 20% a day
[0:37:52] Zuldak: by the way, the big otters you see around the camp that spawn under 2 min left. You need to kill 20 of them for the achiev
[0:38:00] Zuldak: clued in
[0:38:15] witchhobbit: @Shrenko i disagree, youre winning
[0:38:19] Marovia: "if they do that to me" - Hazel who did that to herself
[0:38:24] Silverkitty: i made it just in time to get a hit on the dig boss and i got no cosmetics??? bugged or?
[0:38:28] secretmilkshake: they‚Äôre pretty neat
[0:38:39] winniepixx: how often can you do this on your character? once a week per character?
[0:38:47] Ujai321: can you check if you can just... let the bots kill the dungeon?
[0:38:51] keyboardturner: all my cosmetics i've gotten have been from tomes that you get from filling the bar
[0:38:53] Shrenko: @haleych thank you! my guild will hate me and probably kick me out of the next raid though
[0:38:57] Ujai321: just dot something every 2 minutes or something
[0:39:04] BoogiePonderosa: Col. Mustard, Prof. Plum...
[0:39:08] krooney22: krooney22 is continuing the Gift Sub they got from dvkJoe! 
[0:39:10] Marovia: isnt the Tank in the starting area?
[0:39:21] sence_00: its always the same NPCs I think. I was hoping you'd get the Horde tank sometimes...Brekka?
[0:39:28] manoomu: @Ujai321 they tested that and they won't continue without you
[0:39:29] Crimzon7: How do you do follower dungeons?
[0:39:30] Shrenko: they buffed :O
[0:39:38] keyboardturner: austin was hunter trainer in alliance side exile's reach
[0:39:44] witchhobbit: @Shrenko hazelCry  we gnomes will take over one day
[0:39:45] averageteacup: I'm doing Brakenhide dungeon with followers now .. amazing
[0:40:09] Bensiano: Hazel whats ur fav hair colour/ :P
[0:40:10] Ujai321: you know what i want? Details.
[0:40:17] Shrenko: @haleych cohh7
[0:40:17] Ujai321: oh nice, that worked
[0:40:34] mcxoney: it would be dope if they added johnny awesome to follower duengons
[0:40:35] Tr4umhaft: yes, they sometimes even snap to you if you get far enough away
[0:40:35] secretmilkshake: I healed a follower dungeon to see if the npcs would die LUL
[0:40:39] secretmilkshake: they can
[0:40:42] Bensiano: purple nice colour :P
[0:40:45] GreenArrowed: sometimes? a few i ran yesterday got messy. the tank pulled stuf i'm not used to getting pulled.
[0:40:56] conksalot: I love the follower dungeons.
[0:40:58] cupcakechaos013: hi hazel! hope you are doing well hazelLove
[0:41:07] Ujai321: aw, details doesnt work. probably better that way
[0:41:10] Perkolate: but like what if the NPCs did more dmg than me
[0:41:10] Marovia: it would be cool if next time the followers are according to the story, like getting Thrall or Anduin in a specific war within dungeon
[0:41:27] Ujai321: what is the extra button you have?
[0:41:43] sence_00: I would suggest queueing as DPS so you can speed things up
[0:41:59] Ujai321: oh cool
[0:42:55] komolana: can you do follower dungeons as a healer or are the npcs just annoyingly slow to damage if you're not a damager yourself?
[0:42:57] zlinda95: is this normal?
[0:43:11] Ujai321: OR we see Thrall just... backstabbing people
[0:43:22] etherealbeluga: Do you get a good amount of exp from follower dungeons or no?
[0:43:43] Zuldak: Anduin hacks. He is a priest but has a sword
[0:43:46] anker_jym: Imagine if you did a follower dungeon as a dps and were at the bottom of the damage meters lol
[0:43:51] Marovia: would be even more cool have like weird npcs like a Centaur or Ogre as followers but with normal classes of course
[0:44:07] Shrenko: You dont get the bonus exp at the end, which is a big part of your lvls while lvling up. But followers dungeons isnt made for lvling up!
[0:44:24] goplacidly56: These might be a good way for me to try healing again lol
[0:44:28] Ujai321: would you enjoy if you could level and kit out your followers?
[0:44:42] secretmilkshake: their dos didn‚Äôt seem too awful as a healer
[0:44:47] secretmilkshake: dps even
[0:45:09] sence_00: I kinda wish/hope you could use your Warband
[0:45:19] Zuldak: gear out 24 alts and run raids by yourself
[0:45:29] Marovia: @sence_00 this what im hoping
[0:45:35] jgbrit: There's something off about this dungeon Hazel... Oh that's it, there's no 'Vote to kick > Bruh sucks' "Bro wtf? Its a normal" "NOOB" etc
[0:45:51] Kretyn: But playing with real people (pugs) is a net negative‚Ä¶
[0:45:51] conksalot: I am 100% okay with this experience taking over the regular dungeon experience. It's been very poor for a very long time.
[0:45:52] Marovia: i mean they could use all that work they did for garrison followers you know
[0:46:02] Zuldak: followers should be alts :3
[0:46:09] Zuldak: like imagine if it was Anthus tanking
[0:46:10] Ryok: oh man... i'm definitely not gonna looking forward to doing this trash dungeon again in S4 D:
[0:46:39] Zuldak: Clever meat returns
[0:46:50] Silverkitty: are we pushing for r1 m+ this season?
[0:47:20] Perkolate: hey Hazel, what happened to Sharksy
[0:47:26] Zhenedra: Can you do the follower dungons for farming the rings for the tuskar mount ?
[0:47:29] Shrenko: do I need any rep for the Gnome heritage armor questline ?
[0:47:32] Ryok: oh speaking of portals... tuesday i somehow got my first portal this season yagaH friends invited me to a 20 AD which we easily timed
[0:47:42] anker_jym: Speaking of which, I just got the 400 mount achievement last night!!
[0:47:42] GamingRiggz: Hazel think your changing main for new expansion??
[0:47:47] furiforever: Hazel you inspired me yet again. I leveled a Resto Druid, got KSM and now pushing Shuffle, 50% towards my mount! As an evoker main i'm kinda mad resto druid pvp is so much easier!!
[0:48:07] pandoriic: wow that new 6 month mount is great
[0:48:10] Howdy_Werdy: @shrenko the non allied races usually need rep yes
[0:48:29] etherealbeluga: Same with my Worgen Druid! Forever character, lol
[0:48:47] aerohokie: oooh, are you working on the ohuna mount?
[0:49:36] Howdy_Werdy: @furiforever what‚Äôs shuffle
[0:49:52] witchhobbit: changing mains still feels pretty punishing to do but it seems like it won't feel like that as much eventually after war within hopefully
[0:50:11] Tr4umhaft: the constant jumping is so bizarre to see in bots
[0:50:12] witchhobbit: i felt how punishing it was in dragonflight still
[0:50:21] witchhobbit: yeah! definitely the reps
[0:50:21] winniepixx: how often can you do the dig on your character? once a week  or can i keep doing the dig every hour?
[0:50:24] furiforever: Gladius was cracking me up, was listing specs all wrong. Would spam chat with things like Priest/Beast Mastery as enemy spec
[0:50:35] Ryok: oh do you have the otter mount from trading in the dungeon rings? that should be easy to do now as well
[0:50:45] Shrenko: xD
[0:51:03] conksalot: The main Evoker has gotten really complicated. I like Augvoker, but the xmog situation is really bad and I hate abandoning reputation.
[0:51:13] conksalot: I understand completely going back to Priest.
[0:51:23] seamuscg: its not that easy when u dont get the ring drop FallCry
[0:52:36] Zuldak: Go tank on Skari, grab Flabby and spam normals.
[0:52:48] Zuldak: Flabby would delete this place in 5 min
[0:52:52] spookymisty4life: :) Hi everyone, I just got done reading Batman & Robin Adventures: Clayface's Slime Spree.
[0:53:00] Zuldak: go tank for quick normla queu
[0:53:09] Silverkitty: is there a reason to do follower dungeons? or just kinda for fun?
[0:53:10] Zuldak: not follower dungeon normal normal
[0:53:44] LouOfc: Im trying to get the bugbiter pet, but really struggling with finding the fossil
[0:53:58] Shrenko: no loot? :O
[0:54:16] Silverkitty: okay yeah that makes sense, im afraid to dps a lot of time times cause im afraid of all the attention i'll get for doing so much more damage than anyone else can really hope for
[0:54:29] Silverkitty: @Perkolate
[0:54:55] anker_jym: Maybe I have to try the system myself, but watching you do this dungeon with bots just feels...wrong. I'm sure it's fine for learning new roles, but why not just reintroduce the Proving Grounds for that?
[0:55:10] seamuscg: Seat of the Aspects I think
[0:55:11] witchhobbit: bel'ameth
[0:55:16] Kurama__95: Starts in Bel'ameth iirc
[0:55:24] alistairquinn: I got it in Belameth yeah
[0:55:25] Mkidm5: have you tried palword? it seems kind of like your type of game
[0:55:31] sence_00: the Amirdrassil stuff requires you to talk to Alex, I had to go to Amirdrassil (not-emerald dream version) to find it
[0:55:44] spookymisty4life: :) I started working on my first Horror themed story and the title of it is A Special Bond.
[0:55:45] Mkidm5: damn whati s that mount, howd u get it
[0:55:48] paingretzky: paingretzky subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! ah loving the hair
[0:55:48] Streamlabs: paingretzky just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:55:50] seamuscg: i had a quest at alexstrasza before i went to belameth
[0:55:54] Kurama__95: 5 minutes LUL
[0:55:56] manoomu: @saviorofazeroth it's also a way to experience the story as a solo player and a way to learn dungeon specific mechanics
[0:55:57] alistairquinn: It's very quick.
[0:56:27] anker_jym: @manoomu I guess that's true. I'm probably just biased because I'm very anti-AI
[0:56:27] eielwind: huh i couldnt find the epilogue quests anywhere
[0:56:39] Danoria: I kept getting interrupted so it took me about 30 minutes but that's with interruptions üòÜ
[0:56:40] seamuscg: @eielwind did u check alexstrasza?
[0:56:57] winniepixx: the appearances you get for the dig in thaldrassus...do they reset at any point?
[0:57:19] eielwind: @seamuscg yeah i thought so - i checked on both my new main and old one just in case it was a story progress thing but niope
[0:57:43] winniepixx: oh sorry, yeah i am not explaining it right. will there be any new appereances at any point?
[0:58:00] winniepixx: ahh i see
[0:58:07] Zhenedra: !addon

[0:58:28] lemonstagg: finally got the hearthstone from larodar
[0:58:31] Danoria: The dig quests are taking me more time, glitches and all
[0:59:22] conksalot: The dropped appearances and vendor appearances for Time Rifts are the same!
[0:59:44] necrowoof: can do it on an alt
[0:59:50] Kretyn: I was doing a follower dungeon as a healer, we went in to Algethar‚Äôs, and they couldn‚Äôt do any mechanic on the tree boss, so after almost 6 min we got the boss to 30% health with sooo many adds up. I think Blizz needs to help them a bit
[0:59:52] seamuscg: @eielwind are there certain prerequisites?
[0:59:54] Zuldak: its fine, part of the meta requires multiple weeks of the weekly quest
[1:00:03] Zuldak: its not like AA is giong anywhere
[1:00:05] Zuldak: no big rush
[1:00:08] eielwind: not sure
[1:01:08] dconnell81: Just belly flop on it, you won't die. LOL. What a great idea for a quest task
[1:01:50] Zuldak: its day 3 of AA being out and honestly not a lot else was added. Though you do still have the new night elf tree quest thing
[1:02:41] Zuldak: outland cup was fun except for the briars
[1:03:02] eielwind: im struggling hard on the reverse auchindoun
[1:03:18] alistairquinn: Outland lent itself nicely to dragonraces
[1:03:24] Zuldak: i miss pocopoc
[1:04:20] BoogiePonderosa: they see pocopoc rollin'...
[1:04:21] anker_jym: They see him rollin, they hatin
[1:04:23] jgbrit: I noticed the Tmog from the Outland cup was massively cheaper this time
[1:04:30] cashthb: btw doing the argent dailies feels better than I thought te√≥hey would be with dyn√≠mic flight
[1:04:39] seamuscg: yea the outland races had pretty cool scenery and i never played tbc
[1:04:39] spookymisty4life: :) When I was younger, I used to play Frogger on the PC.
[1:05:11] swooftie: do you wish sometimes they would add less stuff in patches to collect? or do you like a bunch of things to work towards. it can get overwhelming
[1:05:40] cashthb: grizzly hills
[1:07:40] FrostDBeers: glad they made the dig on the half hour
[1:07:44] Ryok: i wish we had more soloable dungeon/raid mounts to collect D: i'm down to 5 farms a week
[1:07:54] HagsWorth: that was quick!
[1:08:13] anker_jym: Seeing that groups are still this big makes me wanna do Time Rifts again
[1:08:18] HagsWorth: I swear it usually takes me 5 minutes to get the time Rudy boss down
[1:08:20] seamuscg: @Ryok nah im good
[1:08:24] HagsWorth: time rift
[1:08:52] Ryok: ye but i only got 4 characters at 70 so i usually finish them on wednesday xD
[1:09:28] Kaseyfullofjoy: I love the hound>3
[1:09:36] Kretyn: @ryok absolutely. i wish there were more soloable stuff in general
[1:09:39] dconnell81: Juggernaut
[1:09:40] 324bee21: Does anyone think the Random Manuscript is bugged, it isn't account wide... from the TBC dragon racing
[1:09:45] Danoria: Where is the big dig?
[1:10:11] Ryok: kings rest, freehold i do on all 4, jaina LFR i only do on 3, necrotic wake and mechagon i only do on my main so it's done with pretty fast
[1:10:14] NuttyNatsu: 0 I.t
[1:10:41] alistairquinn: The trinkets had such fun effects and I'm sad they got obsolete so quick!
[1:10:53] 324bee21: @Ryok is there any quick tips to Kings rest all that roleplay annoys me
[1:11:02] NuttyNatsu: Hello! that makes more sense than whatever my phone was trying to say by being dropped onto my keyboard
[1:11:23] diarrhea_lad: hello Hazel and friends
[1:11:29] Ryok: i also got the xavius leather shoulders recently so that farm is gone, i still farm tusks of manoroth on all my 3 alts because of the skip, and the jaraxxus card from nighthold on my main ^^'
[1:11:41] diarrhea_lad: I get to "work" from home today because of inclement weather
[1:11:55] bell1972: bell1972 watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[1:12:11] Danoria: I have a snow day, but ice also got covid for the first time
[1:12:17] Ryok: @324bee21 afaik there's sadly no skip D: gotta do the whole thing every time D:
[1:12:18] Danoria: Ive*
[1:12:27] anker_jym: Hazel, if Inksy became the next WoW villain, what would she do to make her a villain?
[1:12:39] dicemeister23: Hi Hazel good afternoon!
[1:12:53] diarrhea_lad: Tax evasion
[1:12:59] anker_jym: So Illidan lol
[1:13:21] BoogiePonderosa: "my coolness compels me towards evil!"
[1:13:51] diarrhea_lad: "I've traded my freedom for coolness before"
[1:14:34] zoek54: Wait you wearing a wig now right?
[1:14:41] dicemeister23: Why are you running Freehold?
[1:14:43] Kurama__95: They really went the extra mile to make the follower dungeons realistic. NPCs always pull when you try to skip packs and leave at completely random moments savixKEKW
[1:14:43] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[1:14:43] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:14:44] spookymisty4life: :) The characters in World Of Warcraft look super awesome.
[1:15:13] zoek54: @HazelNuttyGames hahhaha thank you for the command hahahhaa
[1:15:22] dicemeister23: MrGM was running Mythic Freehold earlier today and he received all of his missing tmog in one run, from every boss. Possibly bugged. I'm curious if this happens for you lol
[1:15:29] zoek54: It looks good tho :D
[1:15:46] tonibeeswax: the bug mount!
[1:16:02] Zuldak: its still annoying they lowered top speed outside of the dragon ises
[1:16:05] komolana: omg i forgot they turned on lizard flying everywhere!! it looks so weird outside the dragon isles
[1:16:12] BoogiePonderosa: for auld lang syne?
[1:16:15] dconnell81: Is dragon flying faster than regular flying? Dumb question I know
[1:16:23] komolana: @Zuldak wait they did ? :(
[1:16:29] Zuldak: @dconnell81 yeah like 6 times faster
[1:16:49] Ryok: @komolana yeah by a bit... but it's still WAY faster
[1:16:52] dconnell81: @Zuldak Thanks for the info. Noted.
[1:16:54] Zuldak: yeah dracthyr soaring is glorious
[1:16:57] zoek54: How many mounts you have atm?
[1:16:58] diarrhea_lad: does dragonflying unlock with regular flying, or at level 60?
[1:17:01] RTSLightning: I resubbed and bought a character boost and have had a blast healing raids. Thanks for being so positive and dragging me back into the game haha
[1:17:01] JakobLowrizzle: i've not been doing mog farming lately. waiting for war within when you can collect all types
[1:17:05] D4v1d7w17ch: Even with the reduced speed its still way better.
[1:17:05] mossman1979: Yeah didn't they make it slower than DI?
[1:17:11] BoogiePonderosa: "ring of booty?!"
[1:17:36] diarrhea_lad: It's like, 80% of dragonridging
[1:17:45] mossman1979: Yeah, I mean. Its still super fast.
[1:17:51] witchhobbit: i can't even notice the speed reduction
[1:17:51] Zuldak: the logic was: fun detected
[1:17:58] witchhobbit: it's really not bad
[1:18:02] Zuldak: oh i notice it
[1:18:07] mossman1979: So much RP here.
[1:18:17] Kretyn: I didn‚Äôt even notice the 15% speed reduction, it‚Äôs basically the same
[1:18:23] diarrhea_lad: I think it was actually you were flying too fast for the zones to load properly
[1:18:57] mossman1979: That damn pig
[1:19:01] anker_jym: I love these guys haha
[1:19:06] diarrhea_lad: I think this was my favorite dungeon from last season because of the music
[1:19:11] witchhobbit: part of it is that the older zones are smaller
[1:19:12] wolfcloudchaser80: It's just so much faster than old flying that a small reduction feels insignificant.
[1:19:28] witchhobbit: a lot of the older zones*
[1:19:45] Thaxorin: This was always my favourite
[1:19:51] Thaxorin: the greesed pig part
[1:20:29] dicemeister23: bug confirmed LOL
[1:20:36] dicemeister23: Ok if helm drops we know for sure
[1:20:41] cashthb: cromie got really "weird" in df
[1:20:44] dicemeister23: "for sure for sure"
[1:21:07] witchhobbit: shhhh no bug nothing is wrong
[1:21:23] witchhobbit: don't tell the teacher
[1:21:34] Zuldak: the Crinkle Krump
[1:21:37] big_brewer7: they made her much more childlike
[1:21:40] anker_jym: Yeah, she's kinda goofy now
[1:21:41] diarrhea_lad: "a pOrTaL! cLoSe iT!"
[1:21:44] Aleigha48: hahah that was perfect
[1:21:44] sarj313: hey Hazel ! Since they will allow us to gather all types or armor on 1 character and counts to transmog, is it worth farming now? it's not waste of time now going on multiple characters to same dungeon for each armor type?
[1:21:53] milkshark: haven't been able to catch a stream in awhile. you have hair again!
[1:21:56] sence_00: yah I duno that they handled the Murzorond story beat that well
[1:22:02] sence_00: Morchie is fun tho
[1:22:07] Aleigha48: !wig
[1:22:07] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:22:14] witchhobbit: LUL
[1:22:18] Zuldak: well you got the pants
[1:22:21] dicemeister23: Wow.. his luck was crazy then
[1:22:45] Zuldak: what will drop first, Sharkbait or ALL of the mog from the dungeon?
[1:22:58] sarj313: makes sense, ty for the answer
[1:23:04] averageteacup: Transmog farming next expansion, that's what i'm waiting for
[1:23:24] AstraElexion: Yah I had fallen into doing some trasnmog hunting since I've hardly played since MoP but I'm running out of storage space avalonSHUCKS
[1:23:31] wolfcloudchaser80: If you want trasmog now, it's worth farming now. It's not like they're going to take away what you earned once the expac hits.
[1:23:46] Zuldak: heck yes. I have Linken's Sword from vanilla that is in my Druid's bank. I saved it all this time. And once TWW hits, i can get that mog
[1:24:18] AstraElexion: and I was an item hoarder to begin with so my banks for my old mains were already full of stuff alanaWtf
[1:24:23] diarrhea_lad: I've been blasting som Solo Shuffle to get the Elite DK set this season. it's VERY good
[1:24:31] sarj313: @wolfcloudchaser80 i meant since you can user your time more efficient then instead of now and now use it to do other things to complete that wont be affected or changed in next xpac
[1:24:43] AstraElexion: what was that mod you were using to track what you had collected?
[1:25:01] amaya21: nice!!!

[1:25:47] manoomu: what stuff does pet score count if not only completion
[1:26:25] sence_00: i mean you always do KSM, KSH, AOTC right?
[1:26:37] k3lz0: Huh, I'm 110 on feats of strength
[1:26:45] sence_00: oh ya the PVP ones would be big
[1:26:52] wolfcloudchaser80: Dig starting soon if you want it!
[1:26:52] AstraElexion: and sorry if I missed it, what was that mod you were using in game to show what you were collected, or is that in the base UI and I missed it? avalonSHUCKS
[1:26:53] k3lz0: And for some reason I'm 1 on alts
[1:26:54] Kurama__95: 5 runs and no Stolen Breath of Ohn'ara savixCOOK

[1:27:22] AstraElexion: Awesome leighxNote
[1:27:29] sence_00: do you think Druid is the easiest PVP healer? I want the vicious mounts so much but the PVP version of mistweaver doesnt seem to vibe with me
[1:27:32] spookymisty4life: :) I have to get going now, talk to you all later.
[1:27:36] baroner25: Damn good mount collection. I know have more but gotta give you some big respect for getting that many
[1:27:43] k3lz0: All the things also put a checkmark
[1:27:56] MoMoTheEskimo: i'm just hopping in, what's everyone waiting for?
[1:27:59] sence_00: yeah I was wondering if Holy Priest would be better
[1:28:07] GreenArrowed: i like having a holy priest on my team
[1:28:19] AstraElexion: Diggy diggy hole jbardBonk
[1:28:45] baroner25: only bad thing with big dig is when there is a lot you don't get as much frags compare to when there is less people there
[1:28:57] baroner25: Also love the new wig
[1:29:00] GreenArrowed: i don't like playing resto sham in pvp, moving too much to plant AOE heals
[1:30:25] sence_00: handynotes has the NE mog but i think the bow is bugged
[1:30:32] Siks_: Did you fish your goggles in Gilneas already?

[1:35:39] Zuldak: i wish the trash was better gold. Like it should be something
[1:35:55] GreenArrowed: well now i'm going to go look
[1:35:55] secretmilkshake: hamburgers sound great

[1:51:09] SalvadoraWoW: Awe <3
[1:51:12] Uchiha_Cloaky: Illidan is crying in his coffin
[1:51:12] Finnasticks: THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER

[1:51:35] Ujai321: what does bring a tear to your eye
[1:51:35] dvkJoe: Meanwhile Illidan is still beating the sh*t out of Sargeras
[1:51:36] xaaia_no: who was the one with blue hair?
[1:51:40] bluecloud37: I'm sure they won't find another reason to keep him out of future stories :)
[1:51:41] Uchiha_Cloaky: First wow kiss
[1:51:45] Zuldak: i mean, he's a druid. druids have a vibe
[1:51:50] GreenArrowed: shandris

[1:52:18] zoek54: You forgot the flightpoint
[1:52:22] Elrathir: Malfurion is best in cinematics where he either says nothing, or buries orcs alive
[1:52:30] Uchiha_Cloaky: That was ew moment ngl KEKW
[1:52:40] Crimzon7: emerald dream is a short cut though
[1:52:41] xaaia_no: @GreenArrowed ahh thank you
[1:52:45] Flowiinka: wig command :D
[1:52:46] zoek54: Where does that boat go?
[1:53:01] Crimzon7: Portal to emerald dram > Portal back to ohnarian plains
[1:53:07] bluecloud37: LUL
[1:53:08] Zuldak: yeah and he keeps whining 'Tyrande!!!'
[1:53:09] GreenArrowed: in the quest line up to dark heart
[1:53:13] Frejski1: .. so says the SHADOW of Xavius
[1:53:16] GreenArrowed: he's like whiining for tyrande
[1:53:18] databob1: LOL
[1:53:26] FrostDBeers: agreed
[1:53:29] GreenArrowed: and she's screaming, MALFURION MY BELOVED
[1:53:29] mrsrockguru: Val'sharah, when your running around with Yersarh
[1:53:32] BoogiePonderosa: "Walfurion?"
[1:53:35] Zuldak: also hes imprisoned in darkheart thicket by a pushover boss
[1:53:42] databob1: is he the new Mario brother?
[1:53:43] wolfcloudchaser80: @NuttyNatsu Oh, this is just so handy!
[1:53:43] bluecloud37: she believed it was him >.> so he's a whiner
[1:54:00] golden_zangief: That Mount cute  though
[1:54:05] hPeaches: Hi Hazel! Have you seen the fur-endship fox mount?
[1:54:06] KDA_Saturn: as a plant gay, this mount does a lot for me
[1:54:10] Zuldak: stormwind mage tower portal room to here yeah
[1:54:27] Lunarphor: I have done that quest so many times. So many times.
[1:54:27] elliongrey: Is that rainbow trail, a shadow priest thing? I just saw Taliesin with an SP that had the same trail behind his character
[1:54:41] elliongrey: or perhaps, it's a priest thing
[1:54:44] MythicBlack520: year of the wood dragon for china right?
[1:54:54] golden_zangief: It's so pretty
[1:55:01] HazelNuttyGames: !rainbow
[1:55:02] Streamlabs: The toy causing rainbow trails is the Prismatic Bauble! It's available  from Legion's Mad Merchant vendor for 250,000 gold. https://www.wowhead.com/item=140309/prismatic-bauble
[1:55:08] NuttyNatsu: I don't play horde so I can't say where they have stuck the portal, guessing downstairs. Ally got a second floor in 10.2 and it's first portal is to here
[1:55:11] databob1: I saw one at a botanical garden in florida
[1:55:14] KDA_Saturn: Will you be trying Palworld?
[1:55:22] sence_00: Horde does not
[1:55:23] manoomu: no horde portal
[1:55:25] mrsrockguru: No they dont have one
[1:55:33] Triskelian: I think only Alliance has a portal to Bel'Ameth
[1:55:41] elliongrey: There is one in the cataclysm area. IIRC
[1:55:43] ojr03: where does this tree dragon mount come from?
[1:55:43] GreenArrowed: lol
[1:55:44] Crimzon7: Night elves get a new town and less than a day later players are ransacking the town stealing all their stuff
[1:55:47] elliongrey: That horde can use
[1:55:50] eielwind: i had no idea what palworld even was til about 2 hours ago and i saw it sold a million copies already or something
[1:55:50] lost_in_edmonton: horde get a port in mt hyjil to bel
[1:55:50] GreenArrowed: a lot of people were playing it this morning
[1:55:50] PeModyne: Perhaps TOO pretty O_O
[1:55:54] elliongrey: But ,it's one way
[1:56:06] tylerg2018: pokemon but guns
[1:56:07] Ujai321: i hear it's like survival pokemon, so very much pinpointed to your interests
[1:56:07] eielwind: its pokemon basically
[1:56:08] GreenArrowed: i have no idea what it is
[1:56:09] mrsrockguru: Tree mount, is from 6mth sub
[1:56:11] cashthb: the pokemon with guns one
[1:56:12] MythicBlack520: isnt it pokemon with guns
[1:56:17] Shrenko: mix of Pokemon, Valheim, Ark
[1:56:18] BoogiePonderosa: pokemon with guns and work camps
[1:56:23] paltanshoot: All i saw was ppl shooting and punching pokemon
[1:56:25] mrsrockguru: for china new year, as year of the dragon
[1:56:28] tylerg2018: its like Ark: Survival Evolved combined with pokemon
[1:56:34] anker_jym: I heard pokemon getting stoned lol
[1:56:40] manoomu: i saw a clip where someone was able to use their "pokeball" on a human to catch them
[1:56:50] wolfcloudchaser80: Wait, Ark too? Is there building in this new game?
[1:57:15] cashthb: @wolfcloudchaser80 yes
[1:57:20] sence_00: have you seen the Ally Portal room is bigger now?
[1:57:59] mrsrockguru: Oh nice, they finally opened up the stairs to above then
[1:58:01] MythicBlack520: have you already gotten the hoplet pet?
[1:58:07] vharakh_17: would the paladin class campaign quest be done?
[1:58:08] Ujai321: could celebrate that you are trying Palworld
[1:58:11] Nimiar: Cakeception!
[1:58:29] conksalot: Celebrate? You are number 1 for pets on your server.
[1:58:33] Ujai321: i just want you to have cake
[1:58:36] wolfcloudchaser80: Er, hmm. Might have to try introducing my partner to this new game. Especially if we can play co-op
[1:58:45] cashthb: how about a cheesecake? no one celebrates with chese cake
[1:58:47] jgbrit: I saw an almost invisible ghost in the ally mage tower recently, untargetable, never seen it before
[1:58:51] cashthb: or carrot cake
[1:59:10] cashthb: make a 3 layered cheese cake, where's the problem
[1:59:13] Crimzon7: 3 layered cheesecake
[1:59:21] mrsrockguru: It would be nice if they extend the new arch dig and explore stuff to the rest of the game for the old diggs
[1:59:26] Ujai321: i think one layer cake is perfectly enough. three layer cakes are just overkill. who is gonna eat the other two
[1:59:42] Triskelian: I think you should be able to hold it the other way, holding the off hand bottom side out looks weird
[1:59:55] wolfcloudchaser80: A 3 layered cheesecake is like a cluster bomb to the lactose intolerant
[2:00:13] sence_00: i think there are two NE versions
[2:00:23] Zuldak: the torch from the AA is upside down so your butt is on fire
[2:00:32] Zuldak: and its hilarious
[2:00:37] realmarkyb: Hi there :D digging the wig today
[2:00:51] Ujai321: so real talk, how much snow was it actually during the peak. i have heard from "A BLIZZARD!" to "snow in winter. the busses didnt even stop going".
[2:01:05] jgbrit: It this place just a lore tid bit atm?
[2:01:22] Rigelhoof: Did you get all the stuff from the Liberation of Gilneas?
[2:02:05] elliongrey: I've never been in to worgens. I just find it weird to be a wolf that carries swords/daggers/shields/etc
[2:02:06] WeirdBlueBox: Kitty!
[2:02:10] elliongrey: warewolf*
[2:02:11] Rigelhoof: There is a transmog piece of glasses that can be fished up in Gilneas waters.
[2:02:19] anker_jym: You did get it, it got put in your toy box after relogging. Just can't use it one other races. Look up peacebloom in your toy box and you'll find it
[2:02:27] cashthb: most off hands sheath weirdly anyway, I use those sepulcher pokemon thingies since their introduction
[2:02:32] random_redshirt: random_redshirt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months, currently on a 42 month streak! 
[2:02:33] Streamlabs: random_redshirt just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:02:36] Ujai321: 'Do you want to maim a snowman... do you want to steal his arms' - moose, probably
[2:03:00] vharakh_17: shuffle time?
[2:03:03] Triskelian: @Ujai321 That sounds very... disarming
[2:03:12] NuttyNatsu: @saviorofazeroth nice, puts me closer to 500 toys
[2:03:13] vharakh_17: peepoPls
[2:03:16] zaeldron: how your hair has grown!
[2:03:21] Lee57King: I like this wig, looks good on you
[2:03:27] elliongrey: You can get a shuffle in less than 23 minutes? I heard it takes like an hour lol
[2:03:29] Triskelian: !wig
[2:03:29] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[2:03:59] NuttyNatsu: make sure you have usable only unticked
[2:04:02] jgbrit: I'm working on the Porcupette pet atm, I've been doing it 4 times per day for a week now
[2:04:34] elliongrey: Oh right, healer queues
[2:04:40] cashthb: I can't wait till they release follower solo shuffle
[2:04:41] elliongrey: That's why it's fast lol
[2:05:00] eielwind: i like solo shuffle on my DH best but the instant disc priest queues is too good
[2:05:00] vharakh_17: looks like gladius is still broken
[2:05:02] vharakh_17: :/
[2:05:03] elliongrey: That's happening?
[2:05:16] LilyOfTremere: Does anyone know if there's anything special in the Gilneas quest if you do it on a Worgen? As in, special dialogue or some such :)
[2:06:05] vharakh_17: @cashthb follower solo shuffle seems like the new comp stomp lmao
[2:06:28] jgbrit: Do it Kira! LUL
[2:06:42] bluecloud37: added kitty challenge :3
[2:07:52] Caesas: Well clearly she's more important than the arena
[2:08:00] anker_jym: Kira's spying for the other team
[2:08:14] furiforever: i make it use a glowing marching border lol
[2:08:59] Rigelhoof: @LilyOfTremere I didn't notice any different dialog, but there is a worgen only hearth item at the end.
[2:09:53] jgbrit: If you loose just type "sorry, my cat played that match" LUL
[2:09:58] Zuldak: go go kira!
[2:10:20] Zuldak: they offered chicken
[2:10:30] Zuldak: chicken and milk
[2:10:38] LilyOfTremere: @Rigelhoof Oki, thanks :)
[2:11:13] Triskelian: The ele shaman was the one that was on your team  before :D
[2:13:03] jgbrit: You can out mana the resto
[2:13:29] roachmcgowan: Just realized that is in fact Not a giraffe print tie
[2:14:43] Ryok: well i like bel'ameth so far now that i explored it a bit but man... i'll forever miss darnassus D:
[2:15:22] ghostie1995: I mainly have gear for frost dk but queues are long. would the gear be fine if I went blood spec?
[2:16:39] Zuldak: palworld is pokemon with guns?
[2:16:49] Ryok: @ghostie1995 queues for what?
[2:17:41] Zuldak: there isnt anything to do there tho
[2:17:54] cashthb: it's not a real city until I have  a portal to it anyway
[2:17:55] Ryok: maybe they'll have it develop into that for the next expansion or so
[2:17:59] ghostie1995: @ryok solo shuffle
[2:18:00] Aseopp: I miss hanging out in Undercity. The vibes were great down there.
[2:18:13] Ryok: @cashthb there's a portal in SW portal room
[2:18:16] elliongrey: There isn't anything to do in Valdraken either? xD It's just a place to go to idle
[2:18:20] NuttyNatsu: Probably more will be added in war within
[2:18:32] Ryok: @ghostie1995 oh i don't even know if you can queue as tank... only healers have very fast queues
[2:18:51] manoomu: they have all this new underground tech with zaralek caverns and TWW. it would be cool to see them use it for a new undercity
[2:18:53] cashthb: @Ryok idc, there isn't one on my action bar
[2:19:01] cashthb: just mage things
[2:19:12] Ryok: @cashthb oh that's what you mean xD
[2:19:15] little_c2222: I'm standing in the big dig area with a lot of people around me and then suddenly they were all gone and it was just me. Then a few seconds later I'm a different group of people appear around me but less than before. Why does blizz do this. I'd rather be with more people.
[2:19:27] ghostie1995: ohh ok I‚Äôll just have to wait through the queues then thanks!
[2:19:46] kags158: kags158 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! A whole year of Hazel! Happy Friday everyone :)
[2:19:46] Streamlabs: kags158 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:20:02] Ryok: @little_c2222 too many people aren't good either... you won't get any tasks and there's a bigger chance to have a lot of afker's
[2:20:50] eielwind: easy 6-0 game
[2:21:09] eielwind: if you go 6-0 it should count for mount TWICE lol
[2:21:31] elliongrey: Could do the daily BG's/Brawl weekly quests for conquest
[2:21:37] NuttyNatsu: I'd never have the ilvl for solo shuffle, nor the skills. Fun to watch
[2:21:37] elliongrey: You catch up super quickly
[2:21:51] eielwind: hmmm it seems your audio isnt synced with your mouth
[2:21:55] eielwind: (for me anyway)
[2:22:19] Silverkitty: you bullying an rsham?
[2:23:02] NuttyNatsu: @eielwind refresh page or app. I've had that happen before, the audio slowly gets more and more out of sync. Both annoying and amusing
[2:23:40] Aleigha48: do you ever feel like solo shuffle is kind of just battle of the healers?
[2:23:41] Silverkitty: dig in 4 mins or?
[2:23:55] Ujai321: take a break. take a kitkat.
[2:24:03] dicemeister23: did you get dig mount yet? random drop
[2:24:18] anker_jym: Forgot we were on different timezones, thought it was only 11:30 for me and got sad lol
[2:24:23] Triskelian: Taliesin just got the dig mount today :D
[2:24:28] Ujai321: or - hear me out - you keep climbing until you are Glad
[2:24:33] SalvadoraWoW: @NuttyNatsu Glad to know I'm not the only one having that issue :)
[2:24:35] dicemeister23: do you think 5k fragments is weekly?
[2:24:35] RedShamrock11: RedShamrock11 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Yay :D Hi Hazel Happy Friday!
[2:24:35] Streamlabs: redshamrock11 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:24:43] vharakh_17: how much does RBGs get you? you can probably work towards doing 1 RBG per stream above 1000 rating and its probably worth a bunch of %
[2:25:01] Ujai321: eh, that ceiling is made of glass!
[2:25:11] Ujai321: i might be mixing my metaphores here
[2:25:24] eielwind: does flabby go for glad regularly?
[2:25:35] ghostie1995: yes ! exacty
[2:25:38] NuttyNatsu: @SalvadoraWoW I'm not at the moment but it has happened previously and with various streamers. Once didn't refresh just to see how bad it got.. 10 minute delay before I caved and refreshed
[2:25:39] eielwind: GASP
[2:25:40] eielwind: lol
[2:25:42] Uchiha_Cloaky: S1 glad mount was awsome
[2:25:46] elliongrey: I hate that most of the coolest dragon riding customizations were tied to stuff that applies to like 1% of the population
[2:26:08] ghostie1995: sometimes you gotta pretend you don‚Äôt care even though you do lol
[2:26:28] sk8rbunn: the mount is pretty nice looking
[2:26:38] Ujai321: how much percent did you make today? coming from 8, iirc
[2:27:13] Ujai321: whatcha wanna bet?
[2:27:48] sk8rbunn: its normally 5-6 solo
[2:27:49] eielwind: my raid team will gamble hundreds of thousands of gold at a time
[2:28:05] kags158: Whats the deal with these digs? Where is it/what is it?
[2:28:17] jgbrit: I wonder if there is a macro to quick show/hide the raid frame
[2:29:17] Ujai321: so, coming back to Palworld for a second: i just took a look at a stream, and there was a GIANT LLAMA SHEEP looking thing performing a TOP ROPE LEG DROP on something. oh, and it was wearing a sweater and a CROWN. so what do you say, are you intruiged?
[2:29:42] kags158: Thx!
[2:30:00] jeffdmk: did you watch the dog do the speedrun?
[2:30:12] Ujai321: no clue
[2:30:22] TheBiggerBeard: He's it really been so long that all your hair grew back! Holy crap. Looks nice
[2:30:23] Ujai321: oh yeah, there was a dog playing a game at AGDQ
[2:30:25] jeffdmk: you should look it up
[2:30:26] wolfcloudchaser80: $27 on Steam right now
[2:30:28] Ujai321: (which is happening now, btw)
[2:30:45] jgbrit: Inksy looks absolutely slick! Where are those amazing shades from?
[2:30:47] Zuldak: you could have a sub goal to play it
[2:30:51] Zuldak: that would fund the game
[2:30:54] Ryok: the dog run was amazing, very good boy, his name is peanutbutter
[2:30:56] anker_jym: What are the chances of a special guest appearance from Moose again?
[2:30:59] eielwind: am i small brained or what is AGDQ
[2:30:59] Danoria: Have you played A Little to the Left?
[2:31:05] Ujai321: let your partner talk you into it. who si to say, he might have more persuacive power than chat
[2:31:10] Danoria: Or the Storyteller?
[2:31:10] eielwind: OHH ok
[2:31:18] RedShamrock11: oooo looks like I need to go fish after work :P
[2:31:24] Aseopp: I agree about the xmog. Where is the clothing set from?
[2:31:25] Silverkitty: why wont eadweard give me instructions
[2:31:34] Silverkitty: what is this excavating ur doing while u wait?
[2:31:42] Ryok: it's the biggest speedrun event happening twice a year, usually raising between 2 and 3 milion $ each event
[2:31:54] Silverkitty: oh im all about books
[2:31:54] everjaz: the witto backpack ü•∫

[2:32:57] lighthalo11: omg i love the honeystick
[2:33:12] Aseopp: Honey stick and a pot, very cute :D
[2:33:34] Blatsphemare: arnt the vendor ones a different colour?
[2:33:48] Ryok: @lighthalo11 sadly very rare and very expensive D: on my server it's 470k
[2:34:05] jgbrit: Hazel, if you could have dinner with one of you characters, who would it be and what would you talk about LUL
[2:34:08] sence_00: i think its all recolours
[2:34:11] sk8rbunn: they do not, its 2 separate sets
[2:34:15] Ujai321: noverlap
[2:34:17] Bensiano: Is the new patch in wow any good?
[2:34:22] sk8rbunn: 243k frags to get everything
[2:34:24] eielwind: BARNACLUS
[2:34:37] Zuldak: ive done a lot of the digs and i stopped getting new mogs after getting them regularly. I dont know how many mogs can drop from the dig
[2:34:41] cashthb: why? SMOrc
[2:34:46] Ujai321: it's gotta be interesting to talk to a dragon, but then again, they have slept for 5 thousand years, so not a lot of stories to tell
[2:34:51] Aseopp: Yea, Barni would be a good time
[2:34:53] lighthalo11: @Ryok oh wow D: how do you get it? whats it drop from?
[2:34:56] RedShamrock11: Bring the whole Keg for Barnaclus haha
[2:35:14] Ujai321: the real answer is partyboy. what was his name? HazelBro?
[2:35:16] FrostDBeers: try saying big beer budget for barnaclus 3 times fast
[2:35:41] Silverkitty: ur a bird watching main holyyyyyyyyyyy
[2:35:47] Ujai321: "yo, i can brulee your creme without a torch!"
[2:35:53] Tematella: One of the (archivist's) starter quests called "Your First Find" is glitched for me (none of the fixes from wowhead worked either). Did you have an issue, is so, how did you get it to work?
[2:35:55] Ryok: @lighthalo11 in stormsong valley (bfa alliance zone) there's these bee events and something there drops it, not 100% sure on what, some elemental i think
[2:36:02] RedShamrock11: the big beer bear xD
[2:36:18] anker_jym: Big beer bear, isn't that just a Pandaren Monk?
[2:36:26] lighthalo11: ohhh i think ik what ur talking abt
[2:36:31] Tematella: thx
[2:36:41] Silverkitty: i just had the task on ur on and i literally failed it, no idea what i was supposed to do
[2:36:48] Silverkitty: clicked that extra action on everything i could
[2:37:22] elliongrey: LOL
[2:37:23] elliongrey: probably
[2:37:38] Zuldak: i hate to be sexist but you're not a guy so it would be much more acceptable
[2:37:50] elliongrey: ^ that's true
[2:37:52] wolfcloudchaser80: Well, there ARE monoculars which are somewhat more discreet.
[2:37:55] Triskelian: I think as long as it's SUPER OBVIOUS that you're looking INTO THE TREES and not windows, you'd be okay :D
[2:38:00] little_c2222: I got the task Zenata's study, could not figure out what to do. WutFace
[2:38:05] cashthb: people regularly walk around with cameras, binoculars are way less waird imo
[2:38:08] anker_jym: You must always bring binoculars to the beach because of big beer bears
[2:38:15] Silverkitty: i got nothing again????
[2:38:23] Zuldak: a man walking around a neighbothood looking at trees can look like they are looking at other things
[2:38:27] eielwind: i joined a raid and only got 3 tomes lol
[2:38:41] Aseopp: If you get really good at whistling the birbs will come to you
[2:38:42] sk8rbunn: Ive looted like 3 of those, they hang around, not sure why
[2:38:46] Zuldak: im waiting for ATT to update with the loot table
[2:39:10] sk8rbunn: once you have the excavator's set and the mount, no more drops, as far as I can tell
[2:39:35] Ujai321: i'm just chuckling to myself imagining you getting stopped by the police, and you tell them in your pan-bostonian accent "i've just been birdwatching!", and they go "ma'am, exactly."
[2:39:39] Silverkitty: show mount?
[2:39:51] Silverkitty: insane
[2:39:54] sk8rbunn: there is a hat, but it doesnt appear to drop from the books
[2:40:00] Zuldak: its a dirt chicken
[2:40:17] Elrathir: you dug that thing up? poor bird, who buried it
[2:40:28] solkana: Just got my chicken.
[2:40:32] Triskelian: You should be able to see if you got the transmog if you have Better Wardrobe switched on
[2:40:39] Aleigha48: I hate that the vendor is so far from the event
[2:41:00] Zuldak: No shade to dirt chickens. They can play with Ebonhorn the dirt dragon
[2:41:09] elliongrey: Do we think that they will continue to add dragon riding customizations to the dragons over the next few expansions? Or, do we think they're going to go back to making static mounts.
[2:41:16] Silverkitty: those backpacksss thooooo
[2:41:16] eielwind: i dont love this mount lol
[2:41:26] sk8rbunn: have fun farming 243k frags
[2:41:31] Silverkitty: OMG
[2:41:34] Silverkitty: look  how fancy that one is
[2:41:34] Triskelian: Nah, I agree, the mount is underwhelming
[2:41:54] Ujai321: "corporate wants to you find the difference between these two backpacks."
[2:42:12] Zuldak: it reminds me of the pilgrims hat from the pilgrims bounty holiday
[2:42:13] jeffdmk: why does this bother you so much?
[2:42:24] raygunnxx: that lantern staff :O
[2:42:24] witchhobbit: i wish the candle was a staff
[2:42:31] witchhobbit: but i like 2h maces a lot too
[2:42:37] anker_jym: I need to equip two on my fury warrior, so I can beat people to death with double candle sticks
[2:42:41] BreninUK: theyre so expensive
[2:42:45] BreninUK: >.<
[2:43:07] Aseopp: @Silverkitty does classy transmog increase pvp dps, or is that just a pve phenomenon
[2:43:19] sk8rbunn: im up to about 35k frags earned
[2:43:19] witchhobbit: i mean cosmetic weapons should just work like cosmetic armor
[2:43:20] jeffdmk: once a week seems like the plan
[2:43:22] Ujai321: what else are you gonna do, hu? (no actually)
[2:43:27] witchhobbit: so u can use it regardless of the type
[2:44:07] witchhobbit: the candle is perfect for pallys but yeah
[2:44:33] Ujai321: "by the light!" *smacks someone with a candle stand*
[2:44:36] Ujai321: yeah that is funny
[2:44:37] witchhobbit: i def think priests should be able to use it too hah
[2:44:49] Zuldak: like 45 weeks
[2:44:51] jshukster: 50 weeks
[2:44:55] sk8rbunn: 48.6 weeks
[2:45:05] elliongrey: If you macro the priest movement boost spell to target self, does that then act as a normal movement speed buff without having place a reticle?
[2:45:19] Ujai321: probably before WTT comes out, who is to say, i'm not doing the maths
[2:45:20] witchhobbit: approaching 2000 attempts on the glazer
[2:45:24] elliongrey: Amazing.
[2:45:42] elliongrey: I didn't know that, and I am so annoyed that I didn't start doing that earlier lol
[2:45:51] wolfcloudchaser80: Everyone else can take a slow walk off a short pier?
[2:45:57] Ujai321: "everybody else can walk. and slowly at that." - hazel
[2:46:12] elliongrey: xD
[2:46:12] jeffnsteff2019: man got brutual cold down here in Pennsylvania
[2:46:19] jgbrit: I absolutely adore this song
[2:46:39] Zuldak: so if you stopped the digs what would you be doing?
[2:47:04] eielwind: should level a worgen mage and knock out 2 birds with one stone :D
[2:47:06] eielwind: (can worgens be mage?)
[2:47:09] Zuldak: oh! you reminded me i need to finish the ED story on my night elf for the heritage recolor thing
[2:47:12] Triskelian: @jeffnsteff2019 It's actually warmer here today than it was earlier in the week
[2:47:29] dergNwolf: they are silly in a precious way"
[2:47:31] dergNwolf: *!
[2:47:37] witchhobbit: everyone can be a mage
[2:47:38] dergNwolf: embrace the silly snoot boy
[2:47:43] wolfcloudchaser80: That's the point! You'll be a scoopcaster!
[2:47:51] Ujai321: it's just very funny to me to imagine this situation in real life... there is a GNOME riding a GIANT DRAGON 2 feet from my face, and i'm just like "nope, i saw nothing"
[2:48:02] sk8rbunn: im seeing if I can hit 40k cheevo points before TWW
[2:48:06] Aseopp: The only class that suits worgen to me is rogue
[2:48:10] dergNwolf: that would be great yes
[2:48:13] Zuldak: just be a worgen druid and you will be in form and dont have to look at em
[2:48:16] manoomu: their dual wielding animations are nice
[2:48:17] sk8rbunn: 38995
[2:48:23] dergNwolf: a pirate worgen sounds like the PERFECT char to get the freehold mount to drop
[2:48:28] dergNwolf: gaySip
[2:48:36] Aseopp: @Zuldak <3
[2:48:39] eielwind: ugh 4 more outland golds to complete and im tired lol
[2:48:53] sk8rbunn: I spent half a mil gold on professions for points
[2:48:59] wolfcloudchaser80: So, funny story. I named my worgen rogue "Night Stone" in Welsh. Which is Nosmaen. And instantly, my partner says "NOSEMAN?!"  .... dangit.
[2:49:09] Aseopp: Is this channel safe for pirate jokes?
[2:49:19] anker_jym: I'll be annoying and suggest Worgen Disc Priest, plz don't ban me ;)
[2:49:36] dergNwolf: I wanna race the outland cup but I don't want to resub, I just *started* my break from WoW tippiHands wanted it to last a month at least!
[2:49:40] Zuldak: uhhh
[2:49:44] Ujai321: @wolfcloudchaser80 he does have a nose, right? so checks out
[2:50:01] Aseopp: LUL
[2:50:12] Zuldak: we dont use that D word in this chat (disc)
[2:50:30] jeffdmk: how would you feel about a sub goal to make you play disc?
[2:50:32] Zuldak: 1,000 sub goal
[2:50:35] Ujai321: a pirate walks into a bar, with a steering wheel in their crotch. barkeeper asks what's up with it. "arr, it's drivin' me nuts!"
[2:50:39] dergNwolf: a unique discipline priest only mount drop
[2:51:01] wolfcloudchaser80: @Ujai321 I assimilated it into his backstory. That was his name before being a wolf, too... and he was teased about it. Now he's a much more literal nose-man. And he sighs.
[2:51:05] Aseopp: @Ujai321 that is the exact joke that was on my mind
[2:51:07] witchhobbit: when is the last time you tried disc?
[2:51:14] Ujai321: SUBNAUTICA!
[2:51:17] GreenArrowed: oooo more wigs
[2:51:34] Zuldak: so that was...2019?
[2:51:37] NamiWhami: I‚Äôve actually always played holy, but really enjoy disc this tier for once. it‚Äôs been massively simplified
[2:51:58] Ryok: i'd also love to see you play subnautica chrisEyes
[2:52:00] Ujai321: more people than me want that
[2:52:13] jeffdmk: I would watch that
[2:52:18] Zuldak: yeah its been 5 years
[2:52:18] wolfcloudchaser80: I adore Subnautica
[2:52:39] Ujai321: and hey, it only took 20 years, but you did get a kind of goth wig, and i take that as a win, however undeservedly
[2:52:40] cashthb: I'd love to see you play jazzpunk
[2:52:41] eielwind: i vastly enjoy disc more in small groups than a raid
[2:52:48] witchhobbit: i haven't tried disc in end game but i'm starting to warm up to it
[2:52:57] jeffdmk: what do you have against subnautica?
[2:53:08] anker_jym: New sub goal: Hazel plays what she wants, when she wants lol
[2:53:44] Triskelian: But - and hear me out - poke bowl pizza
[2:53:48] witchhobbit: emotes!!!! yay
[2:53:59] Ujai321: also, SUBnautica? as a SUB goal? it writes itself
[2:54:10] Zuldak: you should re-release the jailer raid guide for april fools
[2:54:16] spookysnaxx: spookysnaxx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! Happy sub-aversary! Loving the wigs
[2:54:16] Streamlabs: spookysnaxx just subscribed with Tier 1!

[2:54:31] jgbrit: Do you think Zelyxia will still be on your intro screen for TWW? LUL
[2:54:42] wolfcloudchaser80: Subnautica would let you unleash  your ultimate pescatarian power.
[2:55:14] Zuldak: i liked the oribos walk around intro a lot
[2:55:28] Ujai321: moose with moose antlers
[2:55:35] Ujai321: you have like 50 slots open
