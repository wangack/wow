[4:15:30] Isolation_BH: im gonna stick with wrath
[4:15:31] applejuiceforall: DONT FORGET ABOUT CATA
[4:15:33] applejuiceforall: AND MISTS
[4:15:36] Lifestream7: classic, classic BC. SOM, Retail deeerrrp
[4:15:42] Kadly101: Do you think they will keep going down xpacs
[4:15:45] EliBourne: Click keybinds and mouse over targeting in 9.2 also
[4:15:49] Cybernytez: i will just play Retail and Wrath
[4:15:58] Isolation_BH: no
[4:16:02] Kadly101: People were asking a lot for MoP server
[4:16:08] itsJimmyJamal: no
[4:16:09] SilkeySmooth: ditch classic tbc its an arena log game now
[4:16:09] homewrecker101: NO
[4:16:09] nator030: I would love for them to do MOP
[4:16:10] quinraylo: i might play season of mastery but i been playing ffxiv mostly
[4:16:10] lugercro: no
[4:16:11] FamLeeGaming: Cata is trash
[4:16:11] Lifestream7: if you have a lot of free time im sure you can play em all
[4:16:15] JBrandTV: Nah, i don't think so
[4:16:15] BumFuz__: Is this classic?
[4:16:16] DudeMartin: i never played cata but most ppl i talk to say the game became bad after
[4:16:18] back2r00ts: no way tbc was already way smaller
[4:16:20] SgtOneill: cata when it started going down hill
[4:16:23] iFaTaLCeLL: @Swifty MoP and legion
[4:16:28] Iron1kg: a lot of people says WOTLK ruined wow, the rest say Cata did
[4:16:31] Cybernytez: skip cata and straight to MoP LUL
[4:16:32] DChuster: mop classic
[4:16:36] iVukan: straight to mop
[4:16:39] applejuiceforall: 100% I think, they are revamping the old world next expac I think so they will probably do cata because nostagia, also a lot of retail players started in cata nand mists and its nostalgia for them
[4:16:40] Lifestream7: they release BC phases so slow
[4:16:42] Thunder_God_Bane: Classic servers will obviously end with Wrath
[4:16:44] Iron1kg: MoP pvp was so good
[4:16:44] lugercro: wotlkclassic needs new continuation not cata
[4:16:46] osbaa: hope they will stop after wrath
[4:16:46] Kadly101: mop classic ye
[4:16:47] Kadly101: lol
[4:16:50] pgkelmer: What is season of mastery exactly
[4:16:52] Isolation_BH: mop is better then legion
[4:16:53] Tropho63: i think classic will move to wrath and SoM will move onto TBC and then wrath will go back to vanilla as a fresh
[4:17:01] Galdrena: !sominfo @pgkelmer

[4:17:04] EliBourne: MoP was good
[4:17:05] Isolation_BH: DK
[4:17:06] Thunder_God_Bane: Wrath will be the final classic server
[4:17:07] Iron1kg: demon hunters in classic
[4:17:48] Chronicxll: wait I never knew Swifty first name?
[4:17:59] SilkeySmooth: they will do a tbc fresh start before wrath classic
[4:17:59] Thunder_God_Bane: i will play a whole lot of Wrath
[4:18:07] x_baldy_x: Wrath will be 2023
[4:18:08] Lifestream7: @Swifty if you could only play 1 version of WoW, which one would it be??
[4:18:17] Garanoose: Lvl 28 Damn boy you grinding üòÇüòÇ
[4:18:21] Cybernytez: i think Warth will come out end of 22 or beginning of 23
[4:18:27] Isolation_BH: thats pretty awsome
[4:18:36] Isolation_BH: tbh yea
[4:18:40] watching_streams_man: ResidentSleeper
[4:18:43] EliBourne: Nooooo
[4:18:43] Iron1kg: mages would mald so hard
[4:18:46] shale93: I dont think so
[4:18:48] Isolation_BH: Cat
[4:18:50] Raddest: no cata
[4:18:50] SilkeySmooth: frost dk was sooooooo op im going to play one
[4:18:53] applejuiceforall: they would do cata probably first
[4:18:56] osbaa: please no
[4:18:57] Garanoose: Is it best to stack the marks of honour throughout levelling so that at near lvl 30 you can just spam the quest to get a few levels
[4:18:59] Blenfz: !redeem flex
[4:18:59] applejuiceforall: no way they skip cata
[4:18:59] StreamElements: @Blenfz, you successfully redeemed flex for 100 points. elementsOkay
[4:18:59] redcuttertv: cata is after wrath
[4:18:59] easy_wheezy: but leveling hardcore starting at 58 feels like cheating
[4:19:02] Rykor09: Some class reworks then as DK would be super op
[4:19:04] Herzenliegen: Cata then mop

[4:19:18] shale93: they are not going to re-work everything for these classes for SoM lol
[4:19:18] suricatawow: Vanilla > TBC >WOTLK >Cata >MoP
[4:19:32] Solquen: finally u play some good game
[4:19:37] Mr_s0apy: they should start fresh from classic
[4:19:51] Yantel_Gaming: They will stoped at WOTLK
[4:19:53] easy_wheezy: "different stage of wow" -> the moment it all went bad
[4:19:53] SilkeySmooth: the next som will be tbc som
[4:20:01] EliBourne: Wasn‚Äôt cata the first nerf ?
[4:20:08] Isolation_BH: TBC
[4:20:10] iFaTaLCeLL: @Swifty Is TBC getting SOM?
[4:20:20] NoodleKnight23: once flying mounts were introduced it sorta ruined the immersion for me
[4:20:30] Lifestream7: I wonder how many people still play Classic WoW vanilla
[4:20:59] Farrel70: Its sad to see the way wow has progessed these recent years. I have such fond memories of playing Tbc and Wrath back in the days. Now whenever i log on it feels like a totally different game :S
[4:21:02] iFaTaLCeLL: @Lifestream7 So many man
[4:21:05] Platonaki: Cata reshaped the world. I wasnt a fan of how it ripped everything apart
[4:21:32] surfshellybeach: Swiftyyyyyy hope you are having a ripper good day mate
[4:21:33] Lifestream7: @iFaTaLCeLL like the vanilla version, not BC classic?

[4:23:02] iFaTaLCeLL: @Lifestream7  Both are more populated than retail right now i think. But tbh i am not sure on BC because my realm is a populated GDKP one so its kinda biased

[5:27:43] ParzivalsTv: In Central Eu you need 20% of hosue ,flat savings to  have on your account for a bank to give you the next 80% for you to buy house or flat

[5:29:45] ArcByrd: I sell cars and credit karma is unfortunately garbage always off by 20-30 points bad or good

[5:29:48] Noxiex4Charity: yoo Swiftyy <3 how are you bro
[5:29:48] dinalia: Same here.
[5:29:56] rbubbaray: im like 710
[5:29:57] Aliussx: Is this hardcore mode ?
[5:30:01] andTHISiswhat: i think credit is unfair... but i understand it aswell
[5:30:06] AStrawHat: True
[5:30:09] rbubbaray: I use to be like 500 .lol
[5:30:10] Timminsman: 850 is a perfect credit score
[5:30:16] dinalia: I have a score over 800.
[5:30:17] AStrawHat: Big balls to go HC on pvp server
[5:30:20] Isolation_BH: lol
[5:30:23] worriedstif: its messed up takes 10 million years to get good credit but miss 1 payment and its gone
[5:30:36] andTHISiswhat: and put it all in ur name
[5:30:39] rbubbaray: and dont open to many accts
[5:30:39] spipe417: im 790 and have had a credit line for 6 years
[5:30:46] Jawz95: its really simple just pay all your bills on time and your good
[5:30:49] andTHISiswhat: xD not ur moms or dads name xD
[5:30:52] yunoeatsoup: you HAVE to have loans/cards to buiild credit
[5:30:53] dinalia: I deal with credit all day, every day for 20+ years.  lol
[5:30:55] akboii1: dont go over 30% on your credit cards
[5:31:09] Ghostp00: @die people are giving you tips. stop ignoring people telling you how to do it. you're just looking for attenntion from swifty
[5:31:09] yunoeatsoup: join the military
[5:31:11] Enmael00: don't be late on payments... hidden meaning "corporate excuse to auto bill payments"
[5:31:12] rbubbaray: vredit is easy if u have a income and dont over spend
[5:31:15] jonlovitzadmirer: get eth
[5:31:23] rbubbaray: credit*
[5:31:26] AStrawHat: Best credit card strat, be late by a day or two and pay all bills. Credit companies would rather have consistant late payers because they make more money on you and as such your rating bumps. You become an attractive mark.
[5:31:37] surfshellybeach: dam man in Australia it's way different to america by the sounds lol. if you have heaps of credit you ain;t getting a house
[5:31:44] AStrawHat: Usually you dont have to pay much if its a day or two late, if at all.
[5:31:59] dinalia: I remember when credit cards had fixed rates on them.  lol
[5:31:59] rbubbaray: I am using my cards now cause im noyt working but I just got hired, I need to keep my lights on
[5:32:11] yunoeatsoup: @tmostt thats absolutely not how credit works thats how your score goes down
[5:32:13] Ghostp00: "GOOD CREDIT" is literally a healthy amount of debt. No debt = no credit
[5:32:14] Switchess315: The very best thing to do is go to your local credit union and speak to a loan officer. They will tell you step by step what to do. Specifically for your specific case.
[5:32:24] ironforge_1337: @surfshellybeach "having credit" means that banks are willing to loan you a lot of money via credit
[5:32:31] andTHISiswhat: wife and i are starting to build our credit up... we got Ccards this week and we only gonna use for gas or emergency
[5:32:34] ironforge_1337: do you mean debt?
[5:32:37] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[5:32:50] spipe417: I buy everything with my credit card and then pay it all off at the end of the month. Get a decent amount of cash back too, 2%
[5:32:55] surfshellybeach: yeah soz man I meant if you have too much
[5:33:07] Ghostp00: ill bet you're able to write all of that stuff off too since it's 'for work'
[5:33:07] AStrawHat: @yunoeatsoup Thats what you are told but I promise thats not the case.
[5:33:07] surfshellybeach: they are pretty strict nowadays in my state with how much credit
[5:33:38] akboii1: im 22 with like a 40 month streak
[5:33:39] Ghostp00: after 7 years they close. eventually collectors will close those accounts
[5:34:04] rbubbaray: yeah .lol
[5:34:07] Ghostp00: collectors "BUY" your debt from creditors

[5:34:26] rbubbaray: yeah 7 yrs but it impacts the score
[5:34:43] Ghostp00: yes it absolutely impacts your score
[5:34:51] ironforge_1337: get a new bank
[5:34:51] akboii1: gyms make you go in
[5:34:53] akboii1: to cancel it
[5:34:56] Ghostp00: call your bank to stop payemnts on it
[5:35:01] akboii1: its so dumb
[5:35:06] rbubbaray: and they still get from thye estate if you sell , even if its a kin that died and isnt ur credit balance
[5:35:07] peroladan: lol bank wont help? what kind of bank is that LUL

[5:35:13] xichell: Planet Fitness lmao
[5:35:13] Drmiik: you still doing retail pvp content ? was so fun
[5:35:22] optrixtv: i would put subscriptions on credit cards cuz they can usually charge back payments easier
[5:35:25] spipe417: in the US, there is a service called *** and you can make disposable cards that you can refill or set monthly limits. Good for the cases like the gym
[5:35:34] Ghostp00: canceling credit hurts your credit score too
[5:35:35] Cybernytez: eh get a lawyer then
[5:35:54] rbubbaray: by law for estates they advertise in pappers so the CC companys sees it and claims
[5:36:02] Ghostp00: lol
[5:36:08] ghettotrampstamp: Siriusxm did that to me for a whole year. I called every month to cancel
[5:36:20] spipe417: is it LA Fitness, they are known to do this?
[5:36:20] zergling87: go through the prossess again and document everything. so when it does show up on your credit you can get it settled possibly sue if you feel that rought
[5:36:33] FreddiFish07: bro they're ripping you off call the FBI director
[5:36:36] Ghostp00: cant you just call your bank to stop payments @FatMatt1982
[5:36:43] ghettotrampstamp: I even got a new card and it followed to the new card
[5:36:55] Superminty: siriusxm is the worst to try to cancel, they are straight criminals
[5:36:57] Darkthrago: Hey @swifty how are you enjoying the Shaman ?
