[1:19:02] IianaDRK: yeh its 1am for that region
[1:19:31] SonofHorus82: it didn't. I want and killed him and no mount drop. the mount is the WQ reward and since the WQ didn't pop I didn't get it. I did it on another character that did have WQ unlocked in about 20 minutes. It goes a lot faster when you already know where it all is.

[1:44:01] Joneeeez: people want retail 10.0 stuffs more  for sure than old content like tbc/wotlk classic etc
[1:44:09] trivotix: The people I played with in TBC and Wrath is what made it so amazing for me. They all had kids and did this thing called life and left me to reclaim my virginity.
[1:44:15] isBadIRL: we all stopped because we sorta realized we did it all before, and were fine with not continuing.
[1:44:23] BirdzFlyinHi: @EZClapBruh chill lol, its not that serious
[1:44:34] cahoots82: Raiding mythic with viewers sound fucking terrible, tbh

[1:46:23] Sicknessqt: im missing that one too LUL
[1:46:26] IianaDRK: esfand left his guild and transfered servers. he just plays with other people now. stream guilds tend to fizzle out when the streamer stops playing

[1:48:35] KragnosWoW: the excuses for leaving were sus
[1:48:55] Anbean: well..you dont want to be arround those ppl in real life either
[1:48:55] luckfore: fuck em
[1:49:07] Balkep: @EZClapBruh got it, you have no idea what you're talking about - leveling takes about 15 hours max, then you do chaos dungeons and guardian raids every day, as well as daily and weekly tasks and abyssal dungeons - not knowing how gating this it and how 3 days don't matter at all shows you're full of shit :)
[1:49:40] sl_dom: @Towelliee you still have your spear from ToC on
[1:49:42] SonofHorus82: I really enjoyed playing with towelliee and the other guildies. fuck those twats.
[1:49:47] athedusgrimwilde: It's all about having fun with your friends, in my opinion.
[1:49:49] PokerFaceMoose: i was on the raid team, and they never even told me they were leaving until they were gone. guess i wasnt good enough for them lol
[1:49:51] TheseDaysLIVE: @Balkep You just made my argument for me. You are saying you can achieve everything in less than 72 hours. Making the 72 headstart even more powerfull
[1:49:54] Narmus_: I left NW after a month n half and max levelling and levellinglots of professions
[1:50:02] RarhMT: always two sides to every story
[1:50:07] trivotix: @Towelliee you have lance equipped

[1:51:31] Sacura_Shadow: XD
[1:51:31] alextheory_: are you gonna progress if raid shows up during lost ark marathon
[1:51:38] Hybridwarhawk: Saved
[1:51:40] TheseDaysLIVE: @Balkep My point is that people now feel pressured to buy the headstart to become socially accepted by other groups of players that also have achieved everything during the head start. Starting later will be devastating for people that look to join guilds
[1:51:47] mavericks312: the crazy game month ahead starts today
[1:52:08] antori_92: do we have a data for 9.2?
[1:52:12] ryanc1124: good morning y'all, dan quinn multi year extension. it is a good day
[1:52:20] BloodMage90: how hard would it be to get that weapon again if it went wrong?
[1:52:38] Gingerprimer: @BloodMage90 not that hard at all
[1:52:40] Balkep: @EZClapBruh it won't - you've shown you have no idea how progression works in LA, and how negligible 3 days are
[1:52:47] mavericks312: @NYYRyan24 that doesnt stop dak from running with 14 seconds left
[1:53:11] Rottencoarse: @NYYRyan24 yeah goold luck iwth another 8-8 season
[1:53:12] ryanc1124: @mavericks312 look at mike mccarthy not me
[1:53:41] ryanc1124: @Rottencoarse  ? 12-5 with him at defensive coordinator
[1:53:58] IianaDRK: theres guild recruitment channels on the discord
[1:54:09] gudzzo: i will just play slowly and only 1 character and not many alts to funnel my main nah thanks :)
[1:54:24] Brodih_: you can play the RU version in English if you want to try it now
[1:54:28] TheseDaysLIVE: Yep, and thats the point. Every ''serious'' player is now forced to pay to win KEKW
[1:54:35] Qargory: by that logic, new wow players would never make it into an established guild
[1:54:37] TheseDaysLIVE: aND THATS KINDA WACK IMO
[1:54:41] Eraste: im tempted to grab the small package to start early, game was super fun when i checked it out
[1:54:47] antphilosophy: what's the big deal?
[1:54:48] IianaDRK: dude head start isnt pay 2 win lol
[1:54:55] antphilosophy: it's $15
[1:54:56] TheMisterPenguin: What are your feelings on ESO? Saw the new expansion announced and haven't tried the game in many years. Wondering what your opinion is on the game in general.
[1:54:56] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  Lux was playing the RU client with an english mod for the last month i believe
[1:54:58] H0bbitK1ng: expecting a game to be both free and good is ridiculous imo
[1:54:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: force deez nuts
[1:55:00] Brodih_: when will you be baning p2w from chat ? lol
[1:55:00] Donswag3: morning Towelliee, got lucky as shit yesterday and got Invincible, the Abyss Worm and Marrowfang all in one day
[1:55:02] xirangeix: P2w yet 90% of PVP and super endgame PVE is equalized Kek
[1:55:05] Ambersulfr: It's a brand new game, there is no prize money, it's fine.
[1:55:05] luckfore: p2w andies KEKW
[1:55:06] CardinalTX: I payed early for NW.  Never again
[1:55:11] TheseDaysLIVE: Because serious players define themselves by being ahead. Making it so that they have to do it KEKW
[1:55:13] Screamnsteam: KEKW
[1:55:15] honkblarg: smilegate is in my house making me do it
[1:55:18] antori_92: what is the best covenent for pala tank?
[1:55:18] brozzy: You dont have to buy shit in thsi game with 2 alts and and hour of dailys a day STOP IT
[1:55:24] Ambersulfr: they have to pay the devs somehow

[1:55:42] TheUnknowing: @antori_92 kyrian for m+ venth for raid
[1:55:47] Balkep: @EZClapBruh you do realize that people who were playing on RU and KR servers will outperform newbies even if they start a week later, don't you? just because they know what to do
[1:55:56] antori_92: @TheUnknowing  thx
[1:56:03] szble: oh boy smilegate and epic seven LUL
[1:56:12] TheseDaysLIVE: @Balkep Yes, and those people will start over at fresh servers again
[1:56:41] Balkep: @EZClapBruh "serious" players do research and that's how they get ahead, not by getting the negligible 3 day headstart
[1:56:47] MadOwlNomad: Yo
[1:56:49] Gingerprimer: And also those first 3 days are the most likely to have server issues and other porblems
[1:57:04] IianaDRK: knowledge is power. so are alts
[1:57:06] TheseDaysLIVE: @Balkep Its highly naive to think any serious player would not get the headstart
[1:57:14] TheseDaysLIVE: And the devs know that
[1:57:18] TheseDaysLIVE: And exploit that
[1:57:20] TheseDaysLIVE: thats all
[1:57:22] brozzy: i mean....Saints spent over 5 figures lolw

[1:57:34] Keglett: When is moneysoft throwing a bag of cash at ncsoft so we can resurrect wildstar
[1:57:36] Balkep: @Towelliee exactly, the hardest raid in the game on KR servers was first cleared by f2p players, just because they were good
[1:57:46] pikaqvinashibaniqsait: I wish lost arc was a 50 euro game without an in game shop
[1:57:52] Mecabeast: they play even when its not fun simple
[1:57:57] IianaDRK: dude if u have problems with an mmo doing headstart then u have way too much free time to let ur mind wander
[1:57:57] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || NEW BLIZZARD GAME ANNOUNCED!! THE NEXT BIG FRANCHISE?? youtu.be/X28RheebZ3M
[1:58:02] TheseDaysLIVE: Exploit the fact that serious players find it highly important to be ahead
[1:58:04] IianaDRK: literally every new mmo has done head start
[1:58:04] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  oh oke ty for the info ^^
[1:58:24] Balkep: @EZClapBruh are you speaking for all serious players now? it's naive to think you can speak for everyone when you don't even know how the game works
[1:58:37] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  so he is OP XD
[1:58:54] swordart_19: You all act like there is any prize to win for being degen KEKW
[1:58:57] vitriol38: why lost ark is such a big deal?
[1:58:58] bioreducto: nerf inc lol
[1:59:14] TheseDaysLIVE: @Balkep Yes, im speaking for the mmo culture where fresh servers always end up being a race to BIS
[1:59:23] daddclassic: most likely ordering Gfuel today recommend a flavor for me
[1:59:32] Towelliee: https://lost-ark.maxroll.gg/category/build-guides#classes%3D%5Bwarrior%5D%26classes%3D%5Bpaladin%5D

[2:01:34] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee  DEV HOUR DEEZ NUTS
[2:01:52] Balkep: @EZClapBruh 302 is the starting gear you get after leveling, with T3 being available at launch the gear can go all the way up to 1400-ish - again you have no clue what you're talking about and should do research

[2:03:21] Zippaya: ppl dont kwno to enjoy
[2:03:31] Balkep: 3 days is just a way to reduce the server load while making a bit of cash on the most eager to start playing
[2:03:33] Ambersulfr: you have to make money somehow, otherwise they can't pay their employees
[2:03:36] alucard3zz: not to be pay to win
[2:03:39] mavericks312: ppl are stuck in the 90s model of gaming

[2:04:46] Balkep: @EZClapBruh you can literally buy a boost and buy gold to get carried in wow, what are you talking about?
[2:04:47] EvilStreak: why has everything become a race?? why not just enjoy your time with the game
[2:04:51] Hybridwarhawk: towTinfoil

[2:23:38] Thoreya: 2 classes would be insane lol
[2:23:39] Hazno: two classes for 10.0 would break the Internet
[2:23:42] Thoreya: nah fuck that
[2:23:47] Thoreya: striving for perfect balance is dumb
[2:23:50] Thoreya: give us more classes
[2:23:51] szble: that would be crazy
[2:23:56] Maydie6066: WoW 10.0: Removing classes

[2:23:59] jerexify: Give Hunters either a Healing or a Tanking spec! That would be neat.
[2:24:00] Kisswani: @Thoreya agreed
[2:24:01] Eraste: they cant add classes they gotta spend all their time balancing whatever weird systems they have in the game
[2:24:02] FergusCreative: Nope I think they are going to play it sage
[2:24:02] Gingerprimer: Game is atm kind of balanced ngl
[2:24:02] alextheory_: NEW CLASS IN 10.0 COPIUM

[2:24:09] Alittlegeeky: removing classes in 10.0 lmao
[2:24:11] Cafe0le: they need to redo the spec trees not add more classes
[2:24:15] szble: balance will never be perfec
[2:24:15] CGd0c: if there would be a next class, what would it be?
[2:24:27] Eraste: @hindenbergg 0% chance imo on getting a new class
[2:24:27] FergusCreative: no classes and just focus on great story and gameplay to win back subs
[2:24:32] Thoreya: if perfect balance is the reason were not getting more classes that is dumb as hell
[2:24:34] cahoots82: Balanced... look at rogues in raid compared to say... enhance shammy
[2:24:35] Thoreya: imo
[2:24:40] Yagr6: the raid buffs are not balanced LUL
[2:24:43] itsValrun: I would take Gladiator Stance coming back over any new class.

[2:25:49] trivotix: pay to click is amazing
[2:25:51] Thoreya: it was a 4chan leak, which BFA was also leaked at
[2:25:51] facerolljack: if they hire 50 more class developers i'm fine with a new class, but they are already spread thin when it comes to class designers so more classes will just make it worse

[2:53:10] IianaDRK: bards going to be my 2nd class to 50. its really fun and looks cool
[2:53:52] Balkep: both bards and paladins damage pales in comparison to what true dps classes can do, and you'll need much more gear and fine tuning for any noticeable dps output on a support class
[2:55:08] 3663Sharad: So if you play with at least another player a true dps with a support would be POGGERS?
[2:55:15] Katrikan: @Towelliee bards are mostly healers?

[4:22:31] happybooger: @Towelliee from a blue post "When it comes to Tanks in Solo Shuffle, Protection Paladins have a distinct advantage due to the potency of their off-healing.

[5:48:42] KingsterJake: Right on, just curious! Thank you. I was leaning towards Steam just wanted to know the difference. :P Guess there isn't one
[5:48:57] Murlocz: @Towelliee How hard is it to unlock flying on SL if i come back to play rn? I did all the zone quests
[5:49:09] Redhulk05: you can preorder on steam
[5:49:43] Murlocz: Really?? So no rep grind?
[5:49:43] lovemymage: yeah
[5:49:55] Murlocz: Kreygasm
[5:49:58] ProCaboose95: you need renown level 44
[5:49:59] Murlocz: So good man
[5:50:05] QuigsTV: i think you have to be a certain renown. Or did that get removed
[5:50:31] Murlocz: Way less massive than all previous ones
[5:50:33] otari123: double legendary is still a long grind ? or did they change that to ?
[5:50:34] Jattell: and people are still complaining, its insane

[5:50:42] ProCaboose95: 44
[5:51:07] Jattell: double leggo is 5 chapthers of the campaign
[5:51:09] QuigsTV: I honestly dont remember since i got it the week you could  get it

[5:52:48] LekeroleN: "So you want to fly?" Kappa
[5:52:56] Murlocz: @Towelliee Do you feel like grinding all keys +20 on your main or KSM is just fine
[5:53:01] dracullus: campain + few treasures I think
[5:53:37] QuigsTV: @towelliee every dungeon you time at +20 you get a portal to that dungeon
[5:53:47] Murlocz: Oh i tho there was a reward for all +20
[5:53:51] mojusk: he wants it on the shop next to the dragon bundle
[5:53:58] Korupcija_: it's not cool, it's a bad reward
[5:53:58] Murlocz: @QuigsTV ohh thats it
[5:53:59] Aidler: no-stone mastery
[5:54:03] YungshrimpXD: portals
[5:54:14] NVbrutal: the portals are kinda useless if you do alot of dungeons, they go on like a 8 hour cd
[5:54:21] QuigsTV: @Murlocz i going for all of them next season
[5:54:29] Newlander: @NVbrutal  Resets every key you complete tho.
[5:54:32] JediNeo99999: @NVbrutal  they reset when you finish the dungeon
[5:54:33] YungshrimpXD: @NVbrutal  they refresh after you finish a dungon
[5:54:41] Murlocz: Thats a not bad shortcut tbh
[5:54:55] YungshrimpXD: its very nice
[5:54:59] Murlocz: So you can heart out of a dungeon, get the portal and insta start next one?
[5:55:01] Murlocz: Wow
[5:55:11] Rygothx: Does the key have to be timed or just completed to get the portal?
[5:55:20] JediNeo99999: timed
[5:55:24] Murlocz: Yeah i agree, could be better for the effort
[5:55:24] Newlander: @rygothx Timed 20 or greater.
[5:55:27] YungshrimpXD: timed
[5:55:32] ejectdic: what raid
[5:55:34] QuigsTV: its a quality of life thing i guess
[5:55:52] Murlocz: It was probably done thinking about people that spam dungeons all day

[5:57:09] Plague_GG: doesnt the portal have a cooldown?
[5:57:23] Murlocz: @Towelliee What do you think about a title for top M+ players in every region? Like top 1000 players
[5:57:24] otari123: Thing is tho, if u are somewhat good at the game, and have a real group, its not that hard
[5:57:30] Newlander: @plague_seraph Resets when you finish a dungeon.
