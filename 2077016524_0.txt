[0:13:28] funviking99: oh no
[0:13:33] NeeK_23: SL music is one of the few highlights
[0:13:40] databob1: Self yeeting audio
[0:14:12] databob1: No I can't go back there I have too many parkingbtickets
[0:14:23] MachoCham: Shadows of the Land
[0:14:52] lyreilla: Nice!
[0:14:57] RosieSeren: I stopped playing early SL, and I really want to go back for mounts/transmog but its all so complicated xD
[0:15:21] 0liver_91: it is, farming rares in korthia is a pain since they die in seconds :p
[0:15:32] lyreilla: I haven't even touched Shadowlands yet, lol.
[0:15:34] MuuskeWoW: just all the covenant apecific things can be hard
[0:15:47] MrEvilRex: it works, I have a razer keyboard. The only issue is if you are using a mouse that also have magnets like the naga, then the 2 attract each other at the keyboard corner
[0:15:49] Dark3nRhal: yeah i had that. the hand rest is not that good. in time it will fall apart the material and pretty soon ")
[0:15:51] Elrathir: Shadowlands? WutFace
[0:16:02] MuuskeWoW: Anima farms incoming XD
[0:16:07] MachoCham: Is it a 100% Keyboard?
[0:16:13] MediumRareOG: covenant special features. welcome to arbitrary time gating
[0:16:16] MachoCham: I tried a 60% once. Never again
[0:16:17] databob1: I liked averting but the angel faction. They were lame
[0:16:32] MachoCham: Yeah numpad etc
[0:16:38] databob1: Yeah
[0:16:44] IAmScarlett__: kyrian
[0:16:49] 0liver_91: im 100% getting a corsair keyboard next time aswell, mine is from 2016 and still looks like new even after 10+ hours of WoW daily hehe
[0:17:11] databob1: Right they were named after the coffee machine
[0:17:15] MrEvilRex: after the leather peeled from the wrist rest. I removed all of it and it just became a fabric wrist rest
[0:17:32] databob1: Same thing
[0:17:35] MuuskeWoW: wow my corsair keybord the rgb broke within a year. next one will be steelseries
[0:17:38] Lausten: 60% is good for FPS games, but cant live without 100% keyboard..
[0:17:43] Layliah79: EZ
[0:17:45] lyreilla: HeyGuys

[0:18:52] Shocklate_: I start the new position at work next week. So I'm having some serious senioritis right now about my current work lol. Just cant be bothered to actually work hard this week KEKW
[0:19:35] MachoCham: MidManagmentitis is real

[0:21:01] MrEvilRex: @Shocklate_ ah nice, grats
[0:21:04] Layliah79: YES!
[0:21:19] TruVillainManny: I think they might be the missing link for content when not raiding
[0:21:22] Layliah79: that's fun that they are revamping ground speed too
[0:21:33] NeeK_23: fyi, Ember Court is daily now
[0:21:35] nash25pl: right first time for @MrGM to max the output of this shit storm what is called Shadowlands.   make your you max out anima conductor first and have all POI channaled for best passive anima and graceful offering gain
[0:21:39] Layliah79: SL was great for collection.
[0:22:08] nash25pl: near the flypath
[0:22:14] nash25pl: next to flypath
[0:22:18] Layliah79: at least they did buff grateful offerings toward the end of SL
[0:22:34] MachoCham: Reply saying "Yes I'm currently talking to 110 people"
[0:22:42] NeeK_23: there are cov reps in oune corner selling rep mounts if i remember
[0:23:03] nash25pl: that also mightbe it
[0:23:13] nash25pl: ATT is scuffed sometimes whene it comes to npcs in oribos

[0:25:01] TruVillainManny: Welcome back
[0:25:21] MrEvilRex: shared ownership
[0:25:55] nash25pl: shared ownership is the most scuffed system EVER !
[0:26:06] NateOliveiras: Good morning!
[0:26:11] ponzan: oh man no joke I actually miss SL
[0:26:25] TruVillainManny: House news it not over sharing. Good luck on that.
[0:26:38] Duffman1001: Low key miss Oribos xD
[0:26:55] NeeK_23: HUH
[0:27:02] ponzan: SL was a good expansion
[0:27:06] NeeK_23: oribos was not fun times
[0:27:10] nash25pl: paying twice for a house sounds scuffed
[0:27:20] Drixcie: I have never heard of that system, is it a UK thing?
[0:27:28] MrEvilRex: nice, 2 things to lookout for with the new builds @MrGM 1 is build quality, consult a builder friend if you have one. 2 check if the house is being sold as freehold or leasehold, some of the new build houses are leasehold
[0:27:52] databob1: When you get there tell them their k cups are too expensive
[0:28:01] MrEvilRex: @nash25pl unless u r buying 100% u r always paying more than the original price
[0:28:15] NateOliveiras: Whats with the short memory people missing shadowlands
[0:28:19] nash25pl: I live in a new build and its good
[0:28:25] RosieSeren: I think whatever method gets you on the ladder is up to you, I used a 5% deposit scheme and its worked out great, everyone is different :D
[0:28:58] nash25pl: move up south
[0:28:59] MachoCham: Can get a castle here
[0:29:05] Sleepyjoegaming: my man afternoon
[0:29:16] RosieSeren: why I left hampshire xD
[0:29:17] Robbill_: Thing is, schemes like shared ownership have to exist as house prices are astronomical. Me and Partner want to move to London and SO is the only way we can afford to buy. It sucks having to pay a rent and mortgage, but it still works out cheaper than renting
[0:29:24] MediumRareOG: there are some parking spots in london that sold for 200k
[0:29:31] nash25pl: @MrGM anima conductor !
[0:29:38] NeeK_23: I bought my 2 bed semi for ¬£100k up north about 6 years ago
[0:29:53] Robbill_: Indeed, which can be used as a deposit on whatever is next. Which can be a full mortgage
[0:30:10] MrEvilRex: I know what snagging is, I mean like get someone to check the plumbing and electricals are done correctly. Snagging is just for visible things, like cracks, bumps etc...
[0:30:13] RosieSeren: I think the one that is a bit dodgy is leasehold compared to freehold
[0:30:23] MrEvilRex: 6 years ago, now it's prolly 150k at least
[0:30:25] Xolido: Man im farming the gun from TBC kara from opera event Wolf boss - what lvl should a hunter be able to farm TBC kara ?
[0:30:28] Sleepyjoegaming: what we up to today
[0:30:28] Xolido: its a pain
[0:30:45] Robbill_: @RosieSeren building service charges can get you as well if it's an apartment. Some can be pricey af
[0:30:48] MediumRareOG: karazahn is level 30. so level 40+
[0:30:51] MachoCham: Issue is wages haven't risen inline with house prices
[0:30:59] NeeK_23: TBC Kara? youd want to be level 35 I'd expect
[0:31:01] nash25pl: @MrGM anima conductor i beg you dont repeat my mistakes <3
[0:31:19] funviking99: need a fruit
[0:31:57] MrEvilRex: I've been looking at places too, and I live in london. barely have enough to afford the 25%. Decided to continue living with parents and save up for a couple more years, sinse I'm single it's not too bigga deal
[0:31:58] nash25pl: anima conductor is the thing where you channel beam to make rewards happens on the map it also works passivly towards your overall graceful offering earnings
[0:32:13] NeeK_23: its it all covs showing on ATT?
[0:32:23] Xolido: @NeeK_23 ok cool thanks man - i have tried to get that gun for 6 years or so.. on one hunter never got it
[0:32:27] MediumRareOG: there's an annoying mount here that requires like 5 people to ring chimes
[0:32:31] MrEvilRex: I mean houses are out of the question lol, flats
[0:32:32] Sleepyjoegaming: @MrEvilRex great idea did the same thing now im living in my own home
[0:32:45] Robbill_: @MrEvilRex Make sure you're using a Lifetime ISA to save if you're a first time buyer. Extra 25% on top of your savings from the government (up to 1K a year)
[0:33:00] NeeK_23: @Xolido you'd find it easier to just level to max and blast though everything
[0:33:04] MachoCham: @MediumRareOG Can be solo'd - I solo'd it in SL. Should be even easier now with Dragonriding
[0:33:34] NateOliveiras: I think even with Dragonridgin you'll need help for that
[0:33:43] MachoCham: You could solo it before it's just on a timer to get them
[0:33:47] MrEvilRex: @Robbill_ I'm investing the money instead, 25% is great return but 1k is not a lot in the grand scheme of things
[0:33:55] nash25pl: @MrGM you can do it on normal flying i was able to solo it end of shadowlands but the trick is to know if all the bells are up first
[0:34:24] Sleepyjoegaming: aww mate celebrity haha
[0:34:33] Elrathir: Famous :D
[0:34:36] Sleepyjoegaming: bet he was like sign here
[0:34:37] NeeK_23: honestly I only have the super low drop chance SL mounts left and I struggle to find the will to go farm them. the necro one thats like sub 1% most of all
[0:34:37] Robbill_: @MrEvilRex Oh nice! Best of luck with the saving. It's a nightmare. Still years away yet.
[0:35:00] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:35:09] Xolido: @NeeK_23 No i want that gun ! gonna make multiple hunters so i can be done with it :D
[0:35:13] MrEvilRex: @Robbill_ ty ty best of luck to you too
[0:35:17] nash25pl: lots of it is covenant locked so there might be quest if you are in correct covenant
[0:36:03] nash25pl: venth it says on ATT
[0:36:07] NeeK_23: check spell book itl say
[0:36:15] MediumRareOG: right click your minimap icon on the bottom left and select "adventures"

[0:39:23] nash25pl: of the map
[0:39:35] KaisenSiru: I remember getting that mount on the second kill when it was current
[0:39:36] Big_Rum: cant you dragon ride?
[0:39:41] Big_Rum: wouldnt that be quicker
[0:39:51] Big_Rum: ah
[0:39:55] MrEvilRex: what is the "holy" graphic in the top left?
[0:40:02] nash25pl: yes
[0:40:14] BernasPt96: im back one more day ahhaha
[0:40:15] nash25pl: they do took me 3 seasons to drop it :joy
[0:40:21] BernasPt96: missed u yesterday tho
[0:40:23] KaisenSiru: Its a low chance drop from the chest after defeating them yeah
[0:40:30] Bware2: thought it was a hint on the next mrgm main
[0:40:33] MrEvilRex: coffee? or other bevs?
[0:40:38] BernasPt96: ahah u bet
[0:40:46] BernasPt96: its fine im just messing with you
[0:40:48] nash25pl: you did
[0:40:52] NeeK_23: looks like it
[0:41:03] nash25pl: next eta on bells is between 2-8h
[0:41:14] BernasPt96: im just wondering have u done all the expansions before what u are doing atm?
[0:41:34] BernasPt96: ohhh okok makes sense
[0:41:53] NeeK_23: sundancer needs an item from the AH
[0:41:58] BernasPt96: thats BFA?
[0:42:00] nash25pl: sun dancer requires kirian item crafted by kirian person
[0:42:01] MediumRareOG: 7k rajani rep to go. am i having fun? no, no i am not
[0:42:14] BernasPt96: ohhh i didnt play shadowlands
[0:42:35] BernasPt96: can i fly in shadowland?
[0:42:43] Harai_Ulfsark: you need to kill the birds for him to spawn
[0:42:48] KaisenSiru: If you have a lot of the time rift flake currency, you can buy Rajani rep tokens from one of the vendors
[0:42:58] MediumRareOG: iirc SL flying is still gated behind the campaign
[0:43:17] NateOliveiras: @BernasPt96 You'll need to get to renown fourty something and complete your covenant's campaign + some of Korthia campaign
[0:43:20] BernasPt96: when i return im thinking on doing something like what you are doing now
[0:43:35] MediumRareOG: @KaisenSiru yeah it's 2500 flakes for 250 rajani rep. i don't know who's buying that. that's like 2 dailies worth
[0:43:45] BernasPt96: @NateOliveiras are portuguese?
[0:43:48] MuuskeWoW: do you do it on 1 class or all classes?

[0:44:24] NateOliveiras: @BernasPt96 Brazilian :D
[0:44:40] BernasPt96: the things i like to do in wow is collecting stuff and m+
[0:44:50] RosieSeren: too many things
[0:44:55] BernasPt96: @NateOliveiras ahahah bem me pareceu pelo Oliveiras
[0:45:07] databob1: Not enough tenders
[0:45:17] BBMezzy: Just wish the mount wasn't 750 tendies
[0:45:21] RosieSeren: wondering if the tenders will be sold soon, just doesn't seem possible to get a lot each month
[0:45:36] Bware2: like the weapons. the recolours of the expensive "only available short time"
[0:45:41] NeeK_23: its a daily quest, takes a few weeks
[0:45:42] Harai_Ulfsark: you just click the scrolls, however its RNG which character you'll have on your WQ
[0:45:43] NateOliveiras: @BernasPt96 hahaha sim! :D
[0:46:11] Harai_Ulfsark: yes, and people use to realm hop to get another character too
[0:46:15] BernasPt96: im quiet in between buying the new epic bundle for the new War within or just buying 6 months of wow time
[0:46:19] Harai_Ulfsark: and warmode on/off
[0:46:46] KaisenSiru: @MediumRareOG Thats why I said if you have a lot, and have everything else and the extra is just sitting there, its something. Otherwise not worth it if you need to farm the currency
[0:46:48] BernasPt96: @NateOliveiras provavelmente tenho qe fazer as campanhas todas e as reps para poder desbloquear o flying nas expan√ßoes que nao joguei nao √©?
[0:47:09] BernasPt96: @MrGM btw im sryto be talking on my main language m8

[0:47:55] BernasPt96: my mother doesnt allow me to talk with strangers
[0:48:02] BernasPt96: so no Dm's for me
[0:48:16] Harai_Ulfsark: @BernasPt96 you just need to unlock flying on shadowlands atm, all the older expansions have flying unlocked nowadays
[0:48:19] Mystic_Bard: lol :P
[0:48:20] fremen14: hes lying btw @MrGM he just called all non portugues people the r word

[0:51:07] RosieSeren: told you SL was complicated! xD
[0:51:16] KaisenSiru: Pet petters... assemble!
[0:51:18] Tidesages: Tidesages subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! back with a prime sub lets get party
[0:51:33] BBMezzy: SL is a lot to catch up on if you didn't do the collecting during SL
[0:51:42] BernasPt96: a lot of people didnt liked it very much, i wonder why
[0:51:45] BernasPt96: SL
[0:52:12] BBMezzy: You can do mythic yea, I farmed mythic necrotic wake during DF for the mount
[0:52:17] NeeK_23: heroic 100%, M) i havent tried recently
[0:52:32] urizenlux: thorghast was fun * cough cough
[0:52:45] Bware2: you take that back
[0:52:52] Bware2: ;)
[0:53:08] BernasPt96: the last mount i farmed and got it was invencible
[0:53:14] ellenara35: Hello MrGM, new video on Delves rounding up all the info so far was a great refresher so thank you!
[0:53:14] BernasPt96: im still amazed until today
[0:53:55] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:54:01] NeeK_23: cant wait for the outrage when SL dungeons added to M+ rotation LuL
[0:54:52] NeeK_23: they see thumbnail, make assumption, nothing else will change their mind. ignore them
[0:55:10] Thoreya: people are just always madge
[0:55:26] BernasPt96: w8 didnt hunters had pets?
[0:55:26] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:55:47] KaisenSiru: Sadge
[0:55:51] NeeK_23: @BernasPt96 he plays MM
[0:56:06] BernasPt96: so no more pets on MM?
[0:56:45] Harai_Ulfsark: you probably need to nuke the last boss before he yeets you
[0:56:49] NeeK_23: last boss might be hard if you cant kill before he sends you down as that might reset the fight
[0:56:51] BernasPt96: and bigger than u almost
[0:57:48] Ookami7113: Ookami7113 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 35 month streak! back from holiday to find it's been 3 years \o/
[0:58:07] NateOliveiras: Ok if there is one thing I miss in Shadowlands are the Dungeons. Shadowlands season 1 was way more fun than DF season 1
[0:58:17] RosieSeren: I guess people are so used to clickbait they just assume everything is now and don't use their brains
[0:58:33] MrEvilRex: it's just a zone, the only zone to be upset about is the friend-zonb!
[0:58:35] BernasPt96: warrior fury still sucks?
[0:58:57] Thoreya: bc they just not that good
[0:58:58] ellenara35: do you still get support if a follower is using the twitch Turbo?
[0:59:12] Ookami7113: you think you want it but you don't LUL
[0:59:15] NeeK_23: players dont know what they want, but they know what they dont want
[0:59:40] BBMezzy: Yea but to be fair, there'd be a greater distance between s1 and s4 than half of dungeons in s2 and them returning in s4
[0:59:42] Unwashed: BFA dungeons still the best
[1:00:03] MrEvilRex: @MrGM do you have a standing desk? and if yes do you use it? Thinking about getting one but scared I won't use it standing up
[1:00:07] Thoreya: they should do the 8 df dungeons then a seperate playlist of like 4 dungeons that u can just do keys but get no gear from for shits and giggs
[1:00:09] Sn3kj: Personally i enjoyed them bringing back old dungeons in the m+ seasons as a one of flavour thing / end of expansion thing but im not sure i enjoy it every season
[1:00:39] Thoreya: for s4
[1:00:43] BBMezzy: I mean that with the current setup there was just 1 season before half of the dungeons returned
[1:00:56] BBMezzy: If they were all in s1 then there'd be 2 seasons before they returned
[1:00:59] Layliah79: S4 would be great if they allowed us to vote on all the available M+ dungeons and the top ones were added.
[1:00:59] NeeK_23: I dont know how we coped with  same dungeons for an entire expac. Probs why I did less m+ before DF
[1:00:59] Harai_Ulfsark: i dont think people would do any dungeons if it doesnt give gear tho
[1:01:29] Layliah79: I didn't think it went that bad lol I didn't mind Grimrail lol
[1:01:31] Harai_Ulfsark: grimrail Kappa
[1:01:33] Sn3kj: Its a shame it killed my vibe for playing but i suppose that comes with change! some people like it some people dont
[1:01:35] Jelky55: wdym it worked out great xD i loved s4 SL dungeons  also hi !
[1:01:37] Unwashed: They should rotate each week in s4
[1:01:40] NeeK_23: people voted for Grim Rail, democracy failed us
[1:01:45] xHukk: @Harai_Ulfsark Nope, would ruin the experience.
[1:01:46] Thoreya: imagine doing halls of infusion for 2 years lol
[1:01:58] Thoreya: nah
[1:02:01] amricatt: I hope so.
[1:02:14] Thoreya: think its endgame
[1:02:29] BernasPt96: im  in between buying the new epic bundle for the new War within or just buying 6 months of wow time, what do u guys say
[1:02:40] NateOliveiras: Ion said we can get gear up to m+ 15 and heroic raid
[1:02:47] NeeK_23: for alts I expect so, but for the first time I expect a DF experiene where you have to complete the story once before it unlocks
[1:02:48] Jelky55: buy both @BernasPt96  LUL
[1:03:06] BernasPt96: ahaha both is the best and most viable option right
[1:03:09] Harai_Ulfsark: you can get the goods from the epic bundle later, you may even get a discount
[1:03:09] BernasPt96: LUL
[1:03:24] Veniman: have u played ffxiv?]
[1:03:25] Thoreya: numbers make more sense
[1:03:28] Thoreya: bc of loot
[1:03:30] Thoreya: i\lvl
[1:03:32] Thoreya: ilvl**
[1:03:33] Unwashed: I think it's vault loot that's heroic tier. Doubt any drop loot will be even close to that.
[1:03:52] BernasPt96: @Harai_Ulfsark i was trying to delay buying WW until a sale comes up tbf
[1:03:53] NateOliveiras: Ohh yeah we don't know. Maybe an interface like Torghast where, before starting, you pick the level?
[1:04:00] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[1:04:31] Harai_Ulfsark: @BernasPt96 it will only go on sale after launch tbh
[1:04:35] Jeanssi: bet there can be like 1 normal raid level piece per week that you can upgrade to heroic
[1:04:50] KaisenSiru: Delves Pog
[1:05:00] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:05:06] Thoreya: if delves can be another m+, would be huge

[1:05:26] BernasPt96: @Harai_Ulfsark true fact
[1:05:34] Thoreya: and AI stuff is only gonna get better
[1:06:01] NateOliveiras: If they work out we'll probably have delves in Quel'thalas and Northrend in the other two expacs
[1:06:02] FrostBeered: do you still have your panda hunter?
[1:06:18] MrEvilRex: sorry I do not play Wow, what is a delve? the only delve I know is Microsoft Delve

[1:09:50] MrEvilRex: west wing of the mansion with her personal caterer
[1:10:34] MrEvilRex: lol how old is she?
[1:10:42] Harai_Ulfsark: i just saw one of its thumbnails using a custom private server goblin city saying that gadgetzan is being reworked or something KEKW

[1:13:29] MrEvilRex: oh I'll ask my brother what food they bought at that age. They bought some natural healthy food blah blah blah
[1:13:40] Jack_the_Dipper: Mate, she can even become blond in the next 16 years @MrGM
[1:13:43] Lausten: @FrostBeered Another weasles, hah know just where to put ya! Griffindor! LUL
[1:13:54] Jelky55: collect 5 orbs to empower the middle

[1:15:22] physalis4: Yo! Happy Thursday
[1:15:23] Jelky55: so you should get w/e ?
[1:15:28] Jelky55: oh ok
[1:15:41] physalis4: good good just working
[1:15:44] Lausten: Its not legacy, so so you will still be given loot as if you were 5 in there, which means its only 20% chance for you to get loot
[1:16:16] Jack_the_Dipper: yarrBongos
[1:17:37] physalis4: How is SL now legacy loot yet?
[1:17:39] Harai_Ulfsark: i just want my shift to be over so i can sleep :( halp
[1:18:17] NateOliveiras: Oh it's really messy. My least favorite
[1:18:23] Jeanssi: u can check if u have the tmog set
[1:18:29] Harai_Ulfsark: the night fae campaign goes everywhere and nowhere at the same time
[1:18:48] Harai_Ulfsark: venthyr and necrolords are so much better, even kyrian at least is concise
[1:18:53] Jeanssi: not this a bit lower
[1:18:54] NateOliveiras: That one is Korthia
[1:19:08] PrewtaEU: as a hunter you should've done it. it was the bis covenant at one point
[1:19:19] RosieSeren: I think there's two, one is for doing the story campaign and one for reachign renown level
[1:19:43] Harai_Ulfsark: there are a few like that, mine broke tho :(
[1:21:06] Harai_Ulfsark: i used cheugy mission reports
[1:21:14] Lausten: What ya looking for?
[1:21:18] BBMezzy: masterplan or tldr missions I think?
[1:21:39] FrostBeered: is it tldr missions
[1:21:51] Harai_Ulfsark: @FrostBeered no
[1:22:02] NateOliveiras: Its one from the campaign, another you buy from the quartermaster with anima (which is renown locked), another one from the Queen's Conservatory - The covenant unique activity and another one from the Court of Night reputation
[1:22:04] IntrpdMuppet: tldr missions for mission table
[1:22:22] Harai_Ulfsark: try cheugy mission report
[1:23:34] Jeanssi: this works /run ShowGarrisonLandingPage(111) make a macro of it
[1:24:00] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[1:24:03] Lausten: I think its basically done by any of the table addons, Venture Plan, War Plan, TLDR, etc
[1:24:26] thunduz: good morning to all
[1:24:37] Lausten: You swap LUL
[1:25:02] kimmo_gaming: achievement is called re re re renown
[1:25:10] RosieSeren: not sure if its the same thing but in oribos there was a vendor who sold like a reach 60 renown token if you've already unlocked one
[1:25:23] magemaster225: I know altohollic keeps track of renown levels
[1:25:50] physalis4: Buy your skips
[1:25:55] Lausten: You bought the 60 boost at the flightpath vendor?
[1:25:56] physalis4: by the fp
[1:26:22] Lausten: Last 20 is easy, do campaign
[1:26:23] MilkyChaos: you could slam torghast from level 9 then do a world boss i think?
[1:26:31] BernasPt96: zygor?
[1:26:37] NateOliveiras: No, the item only takes you to 60. I think if you run high levels of torghast it gives you a renown by the end (yeah I kno Im sorry)
[1:26:40] IntrpdMuppet: emissary quests
[1:26:41] Mystic_Bard: do WQ a dung a raid, generaly everything, some torgast
[1:26:42] IntrpdMuppet: world boss
[1:26:45] IntrpdMuppet: raid
[1:26:46] ImperfectDark: i remember getting lots of renown from Zereth Mortis campaign stuff
[1:26:50] Lausten: Its given by anything really, world bosses, torghast, basically anything
[1:26:56] physalis4: You get level skips off bosses and campaign quests
[1:26:58] Lausten: Weekly quests
[1:26:59] MrEvilRex: you pick a meme and start spaming it in chat, then you will be renowned as that one weird guy in chat!
[1:27:04] Mystic_Bard: yes yes you can
[1:27:05] ImperfectDark: yeah shadowlands WB are soloable
[1:28:20] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[1:29:01] Harai_Ulfsark: wormhole?
[1:29:05] Jeanssi: i used a lot of wormhole
[1:29:35] MrEvilRex: man I should be working but for the life of my I cba to solve this ticket!
[1:29:42] Jeanssi: so much content!

[1:30:06] maleeker: yeah i stopped with the 100% quest a long time ago it's soul crushing
[1:30:12] Harai_Ulfsark: what about the bull that you need to kill while being a necrolord with the dog pet to have a chance at dropping a mount :(
[1:30:16] MrEvilRex: it's a feature ticket, it's how we manage feature development
[1:30:36] physalis4: SL was a step up for completing content. When they removed the rip cord the amount of stuff to collect was multiplied
[1:31:00] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies üß° https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[1:31:07] physalis4: I focused on one covenant at a time
[1:31:26] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:31:28] Harai_Ulfsark: path of ascension sucks
[1:31:46] Jeanssi: yeah
[1:31:46] IntrpdMuppet: real easy now
[1:31:49] Lausten: One shots more or less
[1:31:55] NeeK_23: easier... but still annoying af for the full thing
[1:31:56] BBMezzy: I wish they would make the path of ascension completion account wide. I cba doing it on the 3 other armor types
[1:31:57] Padraigah: Yes, at max level you can breeze through it.
[1:32:04] Jeanssi: still need to do the quests to get all encounters
[1:32:07] NateOliveiras: Im farming anima for path of ascension because now its super easy and I want the black transmog
[1:32:25] KaisenSiru: I enjoyed doing Path of Ascension fully across all Cloth/Leather/Mail/Plate for the mogs when it was current
[1:32:34] BBMezzy: That depends.. not if the vendor doesn't show the other armor types
[1:32:47] physalis4: You can buy tokens to transfer anima
[1:32:50] Firelight76: Cant you buy your anima and send it to alts
[1:32:55] Mystic_Bard: you can transfer between covenants and chars with no penalty
[1:33:02] Firelight76: there's no loss to it i think
[1:33:07] Firelight76: and greetings Dan :)
[1:33:07] Padraigah: Near the flightmaster in Oribos there's a guy where you can buy a token to transfer anima to yourself on another covenant.
[1:33:16] Olmaph: 8 raiders from Olmaph have joined! 
[1:33:17] Lausten: @physalis4 But only if you have 1k, it should be 1:1 not 1k tokens
[1:33:33] KaisenSiru: And then I got all the mog from Maldraxxus Abom RNG and Unity. Felt very accomplished
[1:33:36] Jeanssi: time to collect souls from Maw...
[1:33:39] Harai_Ulfsark: oh god the soul farming
[1:33:42] KaisenSiru: for all armor types

[1:33:56] Mergaam: Whats the best way to start collecting in WoW? Any tips?
[1:33:57] LuiBMHunter: eek - shadowlands!
[1:34:01] NateOliveiras: A good way to farm anima is Raid Finder, a complete run gives you like 2k anima.
[1:34:15] physalis4: I remember doing this on my DK and vividly remember getting frustrated by the amount of roadblocks to complete all the covenant content. You can really tell Blizzard never intended to pull the rip cord
[1:34:34] Mystic_Bard: the worst was that we had to go back and accept the Q, can't count how many times I forgot to do it and did some of the WQ
[1:34:51] Padraigah: Actually you can get a ton of anima fast by looting chests and killing rares in Zerith Mortis.  That's where I got a ton of anima quickly to complete path of ascention.

[1:35:00] dreamwell_: Hello, luv! Happy day! Must say, I don't think I've ever seen someone use Zygor on stream.. I'm glad I'm not the only one who knows Zygor's worth! :P

[1:35:53] Jeanssi: ZM is great anima farm, I got 100% anima completion on all armor types+sources long before SL ended
[1:36:18] Padraigah: down near the soul change thing is where the vendors are located
[1:36:22] Harai_Ulfsark: there are a few vendors
[1:36:40] devilbride: steved7Hi deceDrachi steved7Twitchfam
[1:36:42] LuiBMHunter: you got to many things and it ran away
[1:37:36] LuiBMHunter: Time to farm the maw!
[1:37:42] ImperfectDark: need loads of anima too
[1:37:50] Jeanssi: didn't the callings give a lot of offerings if u had max rank anima conductor
[1:38:15] Tauren0309: Hi Dan and Chat
[1:38:17] LuiBMHunter: wonder if you can dragon ride in the maw
[1:38:28] XxGarthakxX: Anima was enough to farm already back them sheesh
[1:38:47] magemaster225: "what a stupid system why did they add that"-should be on the shadowlands box
[1:39:09] Katariatv: HeyGuys
[1:39:22] LuiBMHunter: just need four toons - one for each covenant
[1:39:31] KaisenSiru: Its rough when you need to go back. But when you play passively when it was current you just got it
[1:39:52] ImperfectDark: yeah some of the appearances seem locked to current covenant
[1:40:02] XxGarthakxX: REEEEEE
[1:40:07] KaisenSiru: I had like two toons per covenant to spread getting pieces around
[1:40:09] funviking99: shadowlands at its best
[1:40:10] BBMezzy: Different npcs
[1:40:17] kimmo_gaming: you got to love shadowlands LOL
[1:40:22] LuiBMHunter: engineer toy to get around easier?
[1:40:27] BBMezzy: mrgmHehe mrgmHehe  Shadowlands in a nutshell
[1:40:40] NeeK_23: I was all 4 covs on one alt in SL, each patch I swapped and got everything maxed out. I doubt I could find the mental fortitude to do that now
[1:40:41] dreamwell_: didn't they make it to where you can only work towards one covenant at a time? you can only use the covenant items when you're actively working for that covenant?
[1:40:50] KaisenSiru: So in that aspect for me, Shadowlands was a very fun experience and engaging to collect everything
[1:41:24] Tidesages: you can buy them in a multiple value but you can only  cosume them 1 by 1
[1:41:36] Harai_Ulfsark: we should just be able to pick our callings from oribos tbh, everyone has the same anyway
[1:41:59] BBMezzy: Or, just have them be emmisaries
[1:42:02] LuiBMHunter: can't do it from shift J?
[1:42:04] Tidesages: how did you open that Shadowlands UI
[1:42:14] Harai_Ulfsark: they were also kinda slow to add all the weekly quests to the adventure guide
[1:42:24] dright424: World Quests 2.0!

[1:42:41] NeeK_23: most of the UIs can be opened with macros
[1:42:42] physalis4: Just remember we had to have SL to get DF lol
[1:43:35] Tidesages: how many maw souls do you have
[1:43:37] NeeK_23: its weird that DF is only a little over 12months old and moving on already whilst we were in SL for a decade or at least it felt that way

[1:44:17] funviking99: doing the azuremyst and bloodmyst isles quests, what a chore they are
[1:44:21] Harai_Ulfsark: we also needed a covenant hearthstone, like cmon
[1:44:21] LuiBMHunter: no engineer toy?
[1:44:24] Thoreya: the maw...ptsd ohno
[1:44:25] NeeK_23: no souls? to the maw with you mrgmNotLikeThis
[1:44:45] LuiBMHunter: nearly all my alts went engineering during SL just for that toy
[1:44:55] physalis4: The crappy thing is all the xmog is locked behind armor type. I have all this stuff unlocked on my DK but not my Priest. Can‚Äôt wait for Delves
[1:45:16] BBMezzy: Very fitting
[1:45:34] Jeanssi: yeah
[1:45:41] physalis4: How excited are you for Korthia?
[1:45:42] LuiBMHunter: cant' remember - SL has been wiped from memory
[1:45:44] Harai_Ulfsark: i kinda liked the vibe they went with for shadowlands during prepatch and reveal trailers, the "negative" wow logo is genius and the distorted wow theme too
[1:45:59] NeeK_23: ok so I know everyone hates SL, but that moment when the sky shatters in the cinematic still gives me chills. In some alternative universe Shadowlands was a banging expansion
[1:46:10] funviking99: I love korthia
[1:46:22] dreamwell_: @NeeK_23 lol Agreed!
[1:46:23] physalis4: I forever compare the size of new zones to Korthia bc of you
[1:46:28] Thoreya: 1st season of shadowlands was fire..then went very quickly downhill
[1:46:40] physalis4: ‚Äúit‚Äôs about 2 Korthia‚Äôs big‚Äù
[1:46:59] LuiBMHunter: BFA lead upset at people - right I'm gonna make BFA great - here's SL!
[1:47:12] dwolf010: tomorrow is march tomorrow is pirate month
[1:47:36] Jack_the_Dipper: Quate of the day: When something is so shit, other shit becomes good shit
[1:47:55] BBMezzy: I don't have much good to say about SL but I do love those robo cat mounts from the Kyrian
[1:47:55] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[1:48:23] dreamwell_: What is it that made SL so bad for everyone? Genuine question as I only played the first two months before going on a long hiatus so I really didn't experience much
[1:48:34] NeeK_23: BFA always good
[1:48:36] Lausten: Store it in the tokens, use when needed
[1:48:44] funviking99: everything
[1:48:49] KaisenSiru: Not everyone. I enjoyed SL a lot
[1:49:17] Harai_Ulfsark: @dreamwell_ we spent 3 years on korthia, that was advertised as a "city of secrets" and it was not a city and had no secrets, it was just the maw 2.0
[1:49:26] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:52:29] funviking99: the zones were shit , small and cramped, Oribos was annoying to travel in, zones were separated, systems were shit, the lore got butchered, crown of domination got turned into burger king tiara, They touched Arthas‚Äôs story , need I say more?
[1:52:30] Tauren0309: mrgmHelloThere
[1:52:31] databob1: !emote kraken194CanaryPanic1
[1:53:29] Trobbels: !emote DinoDance
[1:54:05] funviking99: and big nipple guy
[1:54:09] physalis4: No matter how many times I passed through Oribos, I still had trouble finding the fp LUL
[1:54:32] v3sur: Yeah. Torghast is ez for souls. Doesn't take too long to do a run
[1:54:34] NeeK_23: probably not, doesnt take long to get souls outside
[1:54:35] RosieSeren: I just think shadowlands was a bad concept, just been a zone like argus, but doesn't work as a full expac
[1:54:42] Etaranel: Yes especially if you need Torghast achievements
[1:54:48] v3sur: Plus there are extra rewards from high-level torg from the vendors
[1:55:37] Harai_Ulfsark: i think 16 unlocks for all wings as long as you've done one before?
[1:55:52] physalis4: Makes me wonder if in 5 years we‚Äôll look back favorably on SL bc it lead to some new concepts. Improved renown system in DF for example
[1:56:06] bypized: Official revival of Wildstar is being worked on, completely reivented systems?
[1:56:11] funviking99: plus legendaries costing tons of gold  and the mandatory torghast, forgot about thay
[1:56:31] funviking99: yeah
[1:56:43] NeeK_23: flawless is score. speed and % is best
[1:56:58] Harai_Ulfsark: you kill the most you can, loot everything, break everything, get all anima powers you can, as fast as you can
[1:57:27] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah the minimap is weird like that
[1:57:35] LuiBMHunter: mean MrGM making us remember stuff about SL
[1:58:11] funviking99: it‚Äôs your brain protecting you from trauma LUL
[1:58:23] LuiBMHunter: only 15 floors to go!
[1:58:34] Lausten: NotLikeThis P NotLikeThis T NotLikeThis S NotLikeThis P NotLikeThis
[1:58:43] funviking99: yea the vendors
[1:58:53] Shirey12: God I hate this place.
[1:59:00] Harai_Ulfsark: i think i am done with the phantasma cosmetics at least
[1:59:02] Samiccus: I have to say Shadowlands probably goes down as the worst Music for an expansion
[1:59:09] physalis4: Yeah hold onto your phantasma. You can buy some cool stuff
[1:59:22] Harai_Ulfsark: i need the phantasma achievement :(
[1:59:22] funviking99: true
[1:59:32] NeeK_23: Revendreth Music slaps
[1:59:36] physalis4: Then there is the Adamantium Vaults
[1:59:44] databob1: t's such atrying to get all the transmog for the archivists it's such an awful grind
[1:59:49] Samiccus: zerith mortis wasnt bad i agree
[1:59:52] ImperfectDark: @NeeK_23 was literally about to say this. I loved it!
[2:00:16] Shirey12: The only thing good that came from Shadowlands was Castle Nathria. Other than that, a terrible expac.
[2:00:24] Jack_the_Dipper: Giving you a little up dat on McLaren. First Practice Norris on 2 and Piastri on 3
[2:00:34] KaisenSiru: Revendreth and Venthyr hall music is top notch
[2:00:36] Jack_the_Dipper: update*
[2:00:37] Samiccus: Overall I agree Revendreth & Sire Denathrius was the shinning gem from Shadowlands
[2:00:49] BBMezzy: Denathrius had what Zovaal didn't.. a personality
[2:00:57] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL Yeah today first practivce
[2:01:03] Jack_the_Dipper: practice*
[2:01:10] MachoCham: Context; top 4 ran softs rest ran Medium. Might want to temper the excitement
[2:01:14] Harai_Ulfsark: bwonsamdi was a downgrade from its BfA version tbh
[2:01:20] Jack_the_Dipper: Bahrain
[2:01:26] Harai_Ulfsark: his relation to the other loa and the winter queen is weird
[2:01:38] Jack_the_Dipper: @MachoCham ssst dont tell LUL
[2:01:43] Lausten: Bobsalami was great
[2:01:55] MachoCham: I was meant to be in at Alpine tomorrow but we've had to postpone
[2:02:06] Jack_the_Dipper: What keyboard you got?
[2:02:19] MachoCham: Are Razer sending Mods one?
[2:02:36] Jack_the_Dipper: oooh nice
[2:02:54] Shirey12: I can't wait to play Alpha man I need some content.
[2:02:57] Harai_Ulfsark: change the filter to "all"
[2:03:14] funviking99: some loot and mounts drop from last boss of the run
[2:03:23] Harai_Ulfsark: it is :(
[2:03:45] Shirey12: When are Alpha sign ups going live? Are they going to give us a window or just drop it on us the week of?
[2:03:48] Harai_Ulfsark: but there are a few weapons

[2:04:21] physalis4: Yeah there‚Äôs a Mawrat that drops. The red version is from the Gauntlet
[2:05:00] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:05:05] Shirey12: It's the Stonecore backround?
[2:05:16] MachoCham: The dataminer from Wowhead already posted it right?
[2:05:31] LuiBMHunter: no need to be paranoid - we aren't watching you *honest*

[2:06:31] Big_Rum: Dan have you lost weight? you look a bit smaller
[2:06:31] LuiBMHunter: Alpha is gonna launch on your moving day :)
[2:06:54] LuiBMHunter: blizzard are waiting for to set the date ...
[2:06:58] Lausten: God I've misssed hearing that buttons qoute
[2:07:02] Shirey12: I think P1 of Cata was good. I think it will be bad when Dragon Soul goes live... Raid Finder came out, Hunters got focus. I kind of draw the line of labling something "Classic" at Cata. But, I would have rather gotten MoP because the raids were good. Thone of Thunder was a BANGER.
[2:07:26] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:07:44] MachoCham: We didn't even get LFG so I'm not hopeful
[2:08:32] bomayaa: Hey, you know there's a portal toy you can buy using the currency from Torghast? How long would it take to get that if you were starting from scratch?
[2:08:44] KaisenSiru: Cata Pog
[2:08:50] bomayaa: yeah
[2:09:04] physalis4: LUL don‚Äôt die
[2:09:05] awesomeoohh: Do you like to focus on one expansion at a time when collecting? Or do a bit of everything every week
[2:09:16] bomayaa: I thought you can buy it with the things you pick up in here
[2:09:52] Wynem: i love doing torghast on my monk, instant touch of death that hits 3 mobs
[2:10:14] bomayaa: oh it costs 300 phantasmas whatever they were
[2:10:22] Shirey12: Do they think they will listen to lots of feedback regarding "Hero Talents" and also provide class skins with it?

[2:11:14] Shirey12: I would love Class Skins man, I want to feel like a Warlock like I did in Legion
[2:11:30] Lausten: Maybe an hour now
[2:11:44] Harai_Ulfsark: twisting corridors should go fast nowadays, since it doesnt scale anymore
[2:11:53] Harai_Ulfsark: it was already easier on SL s2
[2:11:55] Shirey12: I would pay an extra 20$ I don't care lol I want some cool animations and skins
[2:12:35] Harai_Ulfsark: remember eye of the jailer Kappa
[2:12:51] Shirey12: So for Warbands, Ion confirmed some backgrounds for Warbands, do you think we will have to pay for them when they drop them?
[2:13:07] NeeK_23: I wish class sets dropped in non statted BOE's like the priest Aberrus set appearance can be used by non priests if its a BOE, but since its got stats people charge hundreds of thousands of gold for them.
[2:13:14] physalis4: Omg‚Ä¶not being able to mount here was such an unnecessary handicap
[2:13:23] Shirey12: Yeah
[2:13:41] Lausten: @Shirey12 I dont think he confirmed it, I think he said that would be cool, maybe down the line but nothing planned for release
[2:13:57] MachoCham: The meta was to farm bear tartaer for faster run speed levelling in the Maw
[2:14:05] Shirey12: @Lausten True but he confirmed they want to do it
[2:14:15] Harai_Ulfsark: i was so glad that all my characters were worgen, and my main a druid
[2:14:17] MachoCham: The real spoiler was the launch was a bit crap so it didn't matter
[2:14:17] LuiBMHunter: ooh there's those easy ones in bastion near the fp ermmmm
[2:15:15] Shirey12: Anyways I gotta get back to work, have a good stream and good luck on 100% Dan!
[2:15:16] MachoCham: World building Kappa
[2:15:23] LuiBMHunter: I think covid had a lot do with the SL issues
[2:15:36] MachoCham: It's not just a SL issue
[2:15:40] MachoCham: *looks at crests*
[2:15:47] BBMezzy: How does covid equal unlearning design lessons of the past?
[2:15:56] MachoCham: As in they went in your bags to start with
[2:16:22] LuiBMHunter: bully!
[2:17:00] Lausten: It was cause in Legion we had the weapon absorbing the power while it was in our hands, but putting anima into the covenant pool is not "possible" from a RPG element.. Its odd how they stick to those things after removing so many other things like arrows, quievers, runes etc..
[2:18:22] Lausten: People who havent been able to afford DF yet Kappa
[2:18:52] LuiBMHunter: other players in my solo game - how dare they!
[2:19:12] Harai_Ulfsark: also i never understood soulbinds, why did we need them? how could kleia and pelagos remain bound to each other while also being bound to the player?
[2:19:17] PrewtaEU: More in an MMO. Fekk off!
[2:20:00] StreamElements: Everything We Know About Delves in The War Within - https://youtu.be/Pcj1cvibxdI
[2:20:04] ramzie0: cant you buy the renown item from the vendor in oribos?
[2:20:05] LuiBMHunter: did dungeon bosses give renown per boss or ? can't remember
[2:20:17] physalis4: Yeah you opened up a can of worms doing SL completion stuff
[2:20:20] Layliah79: I really loved the zones in SL. esp Revendreth <3
[2:20:25] meroxzx: whats teh addon for for renown brogress show?
[2:20:32] ramzie0: wait, what's the max renown?
[2:20:33] physalis4: At least you‚Äôll be busy till patch
[2:20:36] LuiBMHunter: world boss(s) ?
[2:21:01] Layliah79: they should boost anima drops in SL now that it's old content.
[2:21:16] LuiBMHunter: lol
[2:21:25] Wynem: be grateful you got one
[2:21:29] ramzie0: oh, for some reason I thought the item in oribos gave you max
[2:21:36] LuiBMHunter: hey it's a lot of studying!
[2:21:38] coversRbetter: last step takes 24h i think if not even more
[2:22:15] LuiBMHunter: hey at least it's not an in game hour ...
[2:22:16] Layliah79: so if u swap and fill out all 4 covenants on the hunter, then technically you can do all the grateful offering dailies on all 4 convents for max offerings.
[2:22:20] s7wede: Hey Dan, I really hope that they release some info about season 4 or 10.2.6 today. I'm honestly looking for a reason to login but can't because it's quite dry content wise atm
[2:22:27] Layliah79: just got back from meeting, if that was already discussed
[2:22:59] bwoods79: I couldn't have survived shadowlands without engineering and the portal device between zones
[2:23:14] Layliah79: YES!
[2:23:28] physalis4: I‚Äôm scared about 10.2.6. Hope it lives up to the hype with all the secrecy
[2:23:31] Layliah79: Zereth Mortis is best place to farm Anima.
[2:23:34] Mystic_Bard: @bwoods79 same !!
[2:23:43] LuiBMHunter: it won't
[2:23:43] BBMezzy: It's a shame that technology does not exist

[2:24:03] Layliah79: no way 10.2.6 would be player housing right? Dx
[2:24:11] physalis4: The community is hyping it up more than the devs at this point
[2:24:12] ramzie0: There was a post on reddit talking about how quiet the retail devs have been compared to SoD
[2:24:40] Jeanssi: Don't get your hopes up, they just gonna announce something like BfA timewalking lol

[2:26:07] bwoods79: a flying pirate ship
[2:26:11] Anethesia: Torghast TW 64 layers
[2:26:32] Layliah79: If it is pirate themed please give  us a mount version of the Timecap'n Hooktail boss.

[2:27:37] havoom01: before last boss
[2:27:37] NateOliveiras: Did you ever get to do the heroic solo plaguefall to get the secret mount?
[2:27:41] funviking99: just too expensive, 800 tenders for a set is a bit much
[2:27:41] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah i just remember one of the cats is inside the dungeon, almost by the end
[2:27:46] Layliah79: Did you ever complete your Torghast cube for powers?

[2:28:19] Harai_Ulfsark: i hate those mushrooms
[2:28:56] bwoods79: Great time to make the move to the US
[2:29:10] Layliah79: BFA timewalking when? KEKW
[2:29:28] Layliah79: that will NEVER happen in the US
[2:29:40] Wynem: health insurance and gun laws
[2:29:46] Layliah79: You could move to Canada
[2:30:05] LuiBMHunter: sun bathe in the morning go skiing in the afternoon
[2:30:05] Layliah79: close enough to visit the US anytime
[2:30:18] CrowMomocle: Canada is well cool
[2:30:25] CrowMomocle: It has a lovely feel to it
[2:30:38] bwoods79: They said in toronot due to the housing crisis they are doing a new thing called "hotbedding" where you rent out half your bed...so weird
[2:30:41] Layliah79: you have universal healthcare, but don't you pay a lot more in taxes to make up for it?
[2:30:44] LuiBMHunter: You could move in wiv luxthos :)
[2:30:47] CrowMomocle: They are very friendly
[2:30:53] CrowMomocle: such a contrast from the US
[2:31:26] Lausten: @Layliah79 Imagine not having insurrance cause you're fired from your job..
[2:31:36] Layliah79: gives peace of mind!
[2:31:38] bwoods79: Everything is covered if you can get it done without a long wait time. In the US it gets done same day if needed
[2:32:19] bwoods79: I know someone that passed away in australia because they had to wait
[2:32:19] RosieSeren: also prescriptions are either fixed price cheap or in wales or if you have a health condiiton (which I do) then its free
[2:32:21] Layliah79: I pay for insurance but not everything is covered, and you have deductibles etc so you almost feel like "is it worth going to the doctor"
[2:32:38] Zenison: Remember that healthcare costs are outrageously inflated in the US, so you actually end up paying way more than what the UK would get taxed for their healthcare
[2:32:44] lequani: gl on your application
[2:32:55] Harai_Ulfsark: around here even tourists are covered by our healthcare
[2:32:57] Big_Rum: tHE BEST EXAMPLE IS WHEN i HAD MY sON IT WAS 5K OUT OF POCKET.. yOU HAD eVIE FOR FREE
[2:33:09] Big_Rum: Caps
[2:33:16] bwoods79: If you are low income in the US your healthcare if free
[2:33:19] bwoods79: the tax payers pay for it
[2:33:20] CrowMomocle: prescriptions in US are extortionate
[2:33:27] Nirland1: ya not in canada health care, only place you can get privite health care and public health care is Alberta every where else is public health care and you wait.
[2:33:32] lequani: saw you applied for a position with echo
[2:33:33] MuuskeWoW: my csection wasent even close to 5k and fully covered
[2:34:19] Big_Rum: So you said MrsGM is a Ginger? Shee looks Bnlonde in all the pics i've seen. Does she color it?
[2:34:43] bwoods79: I think also private healthcare works in the UK as well because of population size... it just wouldn't work here, look at our national debt already
[2:34:53] physalis4: My heartburn meds were $70 with insurance, but if I download a free app I can use a coupon through that, not go through insurance, and pay $20. what does that tell you about the actual cost of the drug lol

[2:39:32] MachoCham: Oh it's natural
[2:39:49] MachoCham: That's because it's your first

[2:40:12] SlithTheSivak: My buddies grandma keeps giving his 1 year old mcdonalds fries
[2:40:18] MachoCham: Potty training is usually 18months + here

[2:40:52] RosieSeren: I'm childfree but I'm a bit judgy about the parents of those 3 year olds in hospital after being given a cinema style slushie, just seems obvious its a bad idea
[2:40:53] zantos2020: I saw a lady one time pour Sprite in a bottle and give it to her baby

[2:46:42] MachoCham: I'll give you ¬£30 for it
[2:46:43] MachoCham: EZ
[2:47:39] magemaster225: OLED
[2:48:13] MachoCham: That's what all the small ones say
[2:48:19] CrowMomocle: What size is yours?
[2:48:20] Niixten: 27"/32" 4k, oled, 240hz with freesync/gsync
[2:48:33] opheim1: When you have to start turning your head to see things on your screen.
[2:48:37] s7wede: Anything over 32 inches and you lose parts of the screen in your peripheral vision
[2:48:56] funviking99: I play on. a 17‚Äù laptop and it‚Äôs fine
[2:49:06] MachoCham: That's the kind of point of an ultrawide for work though I don't need the Peripherals
[2:49:08] ImperfectDark: is it guaranteed renown every time you do a dungeon?
[2:49:18] Forgiven78: I thought i would hate a bit monitor as well but i purchased a "SAMSUNG 49" Odyssey Neo G9" and LOVE it.
[2:49:44] ramzie0: @Forgiven78 how close do you sit to your monitor?
[2:49:49] Killakris: heyo
[2:49:51] LuiBMHunter: zereth mortis WB?
[2:49:52] Forgiven78: I will admit though playing WoW on it can be rough as your UI is spreadout everywhere.
[2:50:06] phopheter: that's the worst achievement
[2:50:14] Forgiven78: arms length @ramzie0
[2:50:15] Nirland1: 42" tv for main game and second computer is using an old 22" no clue what is is if its an oled or led all i know is its old
[2:50:39] CrowMomocle: @Forgiven78 Yeah I was using my housemates one and could never quite get my WoW UI right.
[2:50:48] CrowMomocle: So not going to get one of my own.
[2:50:49] Forgiven78: I can do work on 1/2 the monitor and keep Dan open on the other side of the monitor.

[2:51:59] Alymantara: Alymantara subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[2:52:05] Forgiven78: @CrowMomocle it's gorgeous when you shut your UI down and just take in the visuals but when your trying to raid or do dungeons you literally park your UI set up back like it's a smaller 1/2 size monitor.
[2:52:11] CrowMomocle: so tend to lurk on whatever Twitch streamers I live
[2:52:29] CrowMomocle: @Forgiven78 Oh yes, there is much I loved about it
[2:52:44] physalis4: My roommate in college played TBC on a big tv.

[3:03:17] Kubwa7: i mean...max ilvl at that point was still below 400, right?

[3:12:17] MogSnap: fun parent game.  is it poop or is it chocolate?
[3:12:22] BananaBaby29: Sup @aceplays_101

[3:13:29] bwoods79: I remember the story about the guy that setup 365 accounts to get a free drink everyday
[3:13:29] ratgefingah: when the kids are playing and it starts smelling like shit, the investigating begins. because toddlers will deny all allegations of having pooped
[3:13:54] MachoCham: Here is a fun thought for everyone here paid salary. Happy working for free day
[3:14:00] neverbornlucky: MrGm did the nursery smell better t then the whiny brats at Blizzard over hero talents release data

[3:16:57] death_cam_: i have a bad feeling the dk rider hero tree wont be mounted dk combat (even if its a reskin of the pally horse ability)
[3:17:06] physalis4: not sure why that sent twice
[3:17:06] Niixten: As a collector I couldn't care less about talents.
[3:17:12] Thoreya: i just HATE when content creators try to speak for casuals about this
[3:17:22] MogSnap: a war within the player base you say?
[3:17:32] Thoreya: like jak, he keeps saying its a problem for all players!
[3:17:36] physalis4: oh shit
[3:17:38] Thoreya: like nah u dont speak for me lol. hero talents are cool
[3:17:40] HooDGorE: I think the big issue is if a hero spec sucks nobody will really play it
[3:17:47] HooDGorE: even if the lore is cool

[3:18:32] FinkTV: what item level is your hunter?
[3:18:44] physalis4: WoW has pvp?
[3:18:49] neverbornlucky: Hunters get to look like Void Hunter now
[3:19:15] Iwony: not that I know of
[3:19:16] adampanerabread: kinda back on topic for the lfr vid. do you think people know that there's a catalyst in zereth mortis for those who didnt play shadowlands? lots of sepulcher groups I join have half the group asking for summons because they don't have the zone unlocked
[3:19:21] Thoreya: and i gotta be honest, whoever high end streamer saying that theyd enjoy class skins more are just lying. they would stop caring about a class skin after a week
[3:19:31] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:20:05] BananaBaby29: I feel hero talent could change some graphics of your spells even if only you can see it
[3:20:17] adampanerabread: i'll check it out and see if it works
[3:20:22] jdodge1305: the necklace
[3:20:24] ImperfectDark: yeah the necklace thing
[3:20:30] physalis4: The last boss of Taz will take you at least 20 min
[3:20:37] LuiBMHunter: doesn't being a hunter make everything ez mode ;)
[3:20:43] jdodge1305: @MrGM you need the necklace credentials for hard mode taz
[3:20:52] physalis4: it gets a 99% damage reduction buff
[3:20:56] Iwony: yes you can use DI Catalyst for old stuff too
[3:21:05] MachoCham: Played a bit last night on my Lock
[3:21:15] MachoCham: Was good times, until I realised I wanted it to be Eredar
[3:22:48] adampanerabread: @Iwony are you sure? i just brought an item from ZM to the DF catalyst and it wont let me convert it. unless ZM epics dont work for conversion?

[3:24:25] jdodge1305: yes
[3:24:30] Iwony: @adampanerabread I think only the bought ones from one of the vendors can be put into catalyst not the normal wq gear ... Ithink
[3:24:35] jdodge1305: wear it
[3:24:46] Iwony: already too long ago ^^
[3:25:41] chelfx: yes
[3:25:44] ImperfectDark: the glider yeah
[3:25:44] physalis4: yes
[3:25:57] adampanerabread: tazavesh gearglider

[3:26:46] mikael_jansson90: yeah pretty much
[3:27:03] michaelmm: The last boss takes 20 mins to solo on hard mode.
[3:27:11] jdodge1305: @MrGM I believe you have to use the necklace before you start
[3:27:27] EazzyBreezzy: when is the hearthstone mount event? hopefully i havent missed it?
[3:27:42] Jeanssi: so you can "dragon ride" with it later on

[3:36:30] michaelmm: Maybe a plan to integrate Hearthstone into wow that hit some kind of technical barrier they could not overcome?
[3:36:48] NateOliveiras: I read once in reddit that Tazavesh was the place we were going to be taken after the intro in the maw and it would be our main city. Oribos was supposed to be a travel hub only (speculation only)
[3:36:51] physalis4: It‚Äôs a shame this was never a player hub. It‚Äôs was so much cooler than Oribos
[3:37:16] neverbornlucky: MrGm I am here for that great new  pokemon  tcg digital card game
[3:37:26] chelfx: Yeah the inn is 80% new art

[3:40:40] michaelmm: You need to work out which NPC want it.
[3:41:04] bwoods79: have you done all the full clears of torghast levels?
[3:41:13] Jeanssi: u can kill them while carrying the thing
[3:42:07] michaelmm: There will be a npc that trades books.
[3:42:07] Jeanssi: yes it's there
[3:42:15] chelfx: it should give you a hint
[3:42:15] physalis4: just wait. it gets more annoying
[3:42:30] Jeanssi: it's the same thing x3 just different item
[3:43:00] LuiBMHunter: suuuure you did
[3:43:07] Jeanssi: that's seems like a skull for fossil collector eh
[3:43:07] michaelmm: Take it to the fossil trader
[3:43:09] overgrownpean: if you look at what the item is and who should want it, so the skull i think is fossil guy

[3:47:14] InfinityWasHere: how many bosses in this dungeon?
[3:47:57] chelfx: so this boss fight we show up to bar play bad music and they are trying to kick us out but we are killing them
[3:49:34] death_cam_: the bluepost on legacy loot says 11 lvls above the content to enable legacy loot
[3:49:35] Saggiv: /tickle on all the rats
[3:49:39] death_cam_: but were 10 lvls atm
[3:49:47] Saggiv: You can basicly use /target on most of them aswell, and use /tickle
[3:50:00] StreamElements: Everything We Know About Delves in The War Within - https://youtu.be/Pcj1cvibxdI
[3:50:14] Jeanssi: all of them are on the 1st area, they swap places too
[3:50:23] Jeanssi: or this 1st part of the dungeon
[3:50:48] Jeanssi: i mean this whole 1st part
[3:50:58] Saggiv: You dont need to be close to them tbh
[3:51:33] Saggiv: Maybe they fixed it.
[3:51:36] Saggiv: Mark it
[3:51:46] Jeanssi: do you have target shown on minimap
[3:52:16] MediumRareOG: so can SL mythic dungeons be soloed?

[3:55:30] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:56:11] Saggiv: Last boss will suck D:
[3:56:13] GrizzledGrim: The last boss takes forever solo
[3:56:15] overgrownpean: so'leah sucks
[3:56:36] NeeK_23: last boss takes 20mins solo since 99% damage reduction
[3:56:38] opheim1: has a shield that reduces damage
[3:56:41] overgrownpean: it literally took me about 20 minutes last time I done it on mythic
[3:56:41] GrizzledGrim: Because you dont have a party. She will have a reduce dmg by 99% shield the whole time
[3:57:05] NeeK_23: nope its mythic
[3:57:26] NeeK_23: one of the best M+ dungeons
[3:57:27] physalis4: The boss gets a 99% damage reduction buff
[3:57:37] chelfx: this is the 2nd part
[3:57:56] physalis4: that‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúoh wait it gets worse‚Äù LUL
[3:58:05] NeeK_23: I can run in and 2 man, should be easy
[3:58:11] GrizzledGrim: Has anyone gotten one of the random mounts from dawn of the infinite yet?
[3:58:21] Shrandamar: Pirate Dragon
[3:58:38] overgrownpean: I got marrowfang from it last week
[3:58:48] Saggiv: @GrizzledGrim I got the one from Tazavesh from Dawn.
[3:58:50] GrizzledGrim: nicee
[3:59:07] Saggiv: All dungeon/raid mounts
[3:59:10] overgrownpean: it seems like mythic zero has a better chance of dropping from my experience so far
[3:59:15] GrizzledGrim: O yeah! btw i got the mythic antorus mount the other day! was pretty excited
[3:59:22] Jeanssi: @Saggiv just dungeon mounts
[3:59:28] overgrownpean: only mythic and m+
[3:59:32] NeeK_23: heroic too
[3:59:46] overgrownpean: its listed on heroic but blizz has stated its wrong
[3:59:59] Katariatv: cant wait to watch some alpha content
[4:00:05] overgrownpean: no need to fix it obviously...
[4:00:09] GrizzledGrim: o man i ran that on heroic alot too lol
[4:00:12] NeeK_23: you have a source for that?
[4:00:14] BBMezzy: It's on heroic too, groups farmed heroic when heroic became available
[4:00:49] OrthiadNick: in antorus mythic I hit a wall with eonar when doing it solo :(
[4:00:52] neverbornlucky: I'm waiting shadowland classic beta
[4:01:31] GrizzledGrim: @OrthiadNick what class? i hate doing that
[4:01:43] OrthiadNick: warlock
[4:02:01] MediumRareOG: I'm getting sick of the dracthyr starting zone. Done is 16 times this week
[4:02:23] GrizzledGrim: @OrthiadNick ahh yeah you gotta be on the ball with a slower class like that
[4:02:37] ramzie0: @MediumRareOG Why are you doing it so much?
[4:02:40] MediumRareOG: I'm taking my "free" level 60 evoker on every realm I'm on before TWW comes out
[4:03:07] MachoCham: I mean I don't think that's the game's fault KEKW
[4:03:22] OrthiadNick: @GrizzledGrim yeah, when i try to interrupt the ship i have difficulties with keeping eonar alive and the other way around LUL
[4:03:35] Niixten: Wish I could make more evokers, 60 characters per account is not enough :(

[4:05:00] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:05:16] GrizzledGrim: heres the shield
[4:05:37] dandiddydan: you cant
[4:05:50] physalis4: Dang, now EA is laying ppl off
[4:05:50] BisonD: no you need 5 ppl to clear stars
[4:05:51] MediumRareOG: 2nd account FTW
[4:06:02] BisonD: i lied
[4:06:27] Trebled_Mind: Have you seen the new images of The Crow remake?
[4:06:33] NeeK_23: so dumb you cant solo quickly
[4:06:40] MachoCham: I have a sneaky suspicion that they might remove the mount token from the Dungeon in TWW
[4:06:46] GrizzledGrim: Cant top Brandon Lee
[4:07:10] NeeK_23: @MachoCham dont you hurt me like that
[4:07:40] NeeK_23: Im gonna have alts all parked out there running for that mount
[4:07:45] LouOfc: lol thats so easy now
[4:07:49] MediumRareOG: isn't path of ascension a mini game so being level 70 doesn't help?
[4:08:06] MachoCham: Can you show me the Timeless mount in your journal?
[4:08:11] uglukz: i just did it
[4:08:13] uglukz: super easy
[4:08:22] uglukz: took more time to set it up then doing the actual trials
[4:08:33] MediumRareOG: i don't know the answer. I tried path of ascension once, realized it was a mini game (I hate mini games) and never tried it again
[4:08:34] MachoCham: Timewalking one from any boss
[4:08:59] LuiBMHunter: time lost?
[4:08:59] Jeanssi: timereaver
[4:09:00] Trebled_Mind: timeless Corsair isn‚Äôt it?
[4:09:04] MachoCham: @NeeK_23 knows
[4:09:15] MediumRareOG: infinite timewaster
[4:09:24] NeeK_23: I got it after 2800 attempts
[4:09:31] uglukz: yeah  the last two upgrades take 24hr rsrch time
[4:09:49] Jeanssi: in SE wing here in kyrian
[4:09:57] Trebled_Mind: I don‚Äôt think it would be called a timeless anything since it changes to whatever mount you don‚Äôt have in your journal once you loot it right?
[4:10:03] MediumRareOG: @NeeK_23 infinite timereaver only took me 800 but i've done thousands of TW dungeons at this point so I was always going to get it
[4:10:08] Jeanssi: u need those castle nathria tokens for all covenants if u want all tmogs
[4:10:14] Trebled_Mind: oh
[4:10:54] MediumRareOG: i do miss the easy gold making from SL adventures. I probably made 4-5 million

[4:13:51] MachoCham: Gym time, if I don't make it back alive; it's been a pleasure
[4:14:39] Jeanssi: u can farm these in many places
[4:15:10] Katariatv: how much is zygor
[4:15:23] MachoCham: !zygor
[4:15:23] NeeK_23: I'm glad they backed off the multistage World Quests of SL. I just want to be quick and be filling bars over and over

[4:15:52] ramzie0: the 20% makes it $7.99 not sure if that's for the first month or for all months
[4:15:59] Hannaharmco: about ¬£ 9 a month
[4:16:00] chelfx: 9.99  USD without code 7$ wtih code
[4:16:14] MachoCham: $9.99/mo monthly or $99 yearly without discount
[4:16:19] NeeK_23: I liked BFA, they were either quick minigames, pet battles or kill a rare
[4:16:21] BernasPt96: oh its monthly pay_
[4:16:27] Katariatv: thanks
[4:17:01] NeeK_23: you can for classic but not endgame content
[4:17:10] NeeK_23: *retail endgame
[4:17:12] chelfx: so there is a trick dont tell zygor if your sub runs out just dont open the zygor manger and the addon keeps working you just cant update it
[4:17:35] MachoCham: Until Zygor tells you that you need to update using the manager
[4:17:43] MachoCham: Which it does after so long
[4:19:32] NateOliveiras: Yeah but I think everyone thinks its a bad idea to mix power with class fantasy
[4:20:04] BBMezzy: Retail communication has been abysmal
[4:20:16] chelfx: they have said they are redoing the priest one
[4:20:24] Raezanthir: I thought there was communication on revisiting Oracle at least
[4:20:44] BBMezzy: They put up feedback threads on these trees for just the US forums again
[4:20:49] michaelmm: It's probably already too late for them to change the overall concept of Hero talents.
[4:21:21] Banshee_cze: Banshee_cze subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[4:22:35] NateOliveiras: Your're gonna have quests to unlock the opponents as well
[4:22:48] HuntingElk: Good Morning   Hows it going?  What you doing today?
[4:23:10] Jeanssi: and farm those soul mirrors and stuff for every opponent you're gonna "capture"
[4:23:13] Chesscape: you expected a shadowlands system to be simple?
[4:23:16] uglukz: haha nope lots of back and forth from zone to zone to oribos etc
[4:23:34] uglukz: agree! revendreth with dragonriding is a lot of fun
[4:23:39] NeeK_23: Some things just cant work that way. For example having frostfire visuals on a mage who is a spellslinger wont work. For specs where the same ability is used then you could make it work for both, but thats not most hero trees
[4:23:46] Jeanssi: well all but 1
[4:23:47] HuntingElk: First time in SL
[4:23:53] Jeanssi: so pretty much every1
[4:23:59] NateOliveiras: They removed the need to use the soul mirrors to enter in the arena
[4:24:00] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[4:24:52] Jeanssi: u need mirrors to capture the opponents. entering the arena used to cost medallions of services, which was removed
[4:26:02] HuntingElk: Off topic....did you ever get the Chicken Mount??
[4:26:39] NeeK_23: this is probably the most annoying cov minigame. Necro is just lots of weekly quests, NightFae is an afk garden, and Ember court is quite fun imo
[4:26:45] uglukz: ya gotta lose your first one
[4:26:49] uglukz: if its for the quest
[4:27:04] overgrownpean: I am pretty sure if you have enough medallions of service, you can buy most of the crafting stuff from a vendor nearby
[4:27:06] Jeanssi: u can't continue the quest unless u lose
[4:27:12] uglukz: lol maybe mine was bugged
[4:27:15] NateOliveiras: because its a "lesson in humility" lol
[4:27:22] Jeanssi: or maybe it was changed
[4:27:25] uglukz: it like wants you to lose to the first boss to like teach you how to improve
[4:27:42] NeeK_23: you used to have to buy entry to fight each week. at least now you can go in over and over
[4:27:57] uglukz: yeah its gonna take a min
[4:28:04] NeeK_23: can you jump off
[4:28:07] overgrownpean: i think you can just jump off no?
[4:28:09] chelfx: take your gear off?
[4:28:11] uglukz: she has an aoe that will chunk you
[4:28:12] Saggiv: Jump off the arena?
[4:28:29] CrowMomocle: unequipt some stuff
[4:28:46] uglukz: smart
[4:29:29] overgrownpean: the feathers and pelts can be bought just fyi rather than killing all of these different creatures
[4:29:33] Jeanssi: now you're supposed to craft those footpads that help you survive the encounter
[4:29:34] NeeK_23: there's a secret achievement for one of the bosses, you have to get knocked off the edge and wave to him in mid air. idk if ATT tracks that
[4:29:36] uglukz: yeah got 2 sets from it and 2 mounts
[4:29:39] bomayaa: I feel I can vicariously do all this stuff through watching you as I could not be bothered with all this SL nonsense
[4:29:48] Layliah79: have a great evening!
