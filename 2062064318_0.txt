[1:43:11] radassbadass69: I managed to turn in the grime encrusted salvage even with the 1 minute kick out timer post pug
[1:43:14] VikingJackAU: @tsm_smaha scorch is main threat spamable ability and shadowbolt is a melee cleave that hits 3 or something, that's about all you use mostly
[1:43:21] exnihilo777: loot fuse
[1:43:21] brosephgaming94: How is warr dps this phase ?
[1:43:30] lizcat_: warlock tanking is fun
[1:43:36] radassbadass69: @brosephgaming94 kinda low as arms atm
[1:43:51] tsm_smaha: @VikingJackAU thanks fair enough
[1:43:57] brosephgaming94: @radassbadass69 aww rip. bet its alot better in pvp tho ?
[1:44:14] radassbadass69: @radassbadass69 wayy better pvp that last phase, you are now a credible threat to those around you
[1:44:29] aleck1776: Good
[1:44:37] AmyZe: @StaysafeTV what is that Demonic Embrace icon on your buffs?
[1:44:40] aleck1776: True KEKL
[1:44:48] VikingJackAU: @tsm_smaha the cleave is pretty damn weak though so it's rough trying to aoe tank, you gotta tab dot, great on single though
[1:44:52] iknowido: not many supply boxes drop
[1:44:53] photek_tn: Ive seen a lot of streamers actually having fun again in wow, in sod.
[1:44:53] boopbopbamski: what do you think of the raid so far ?
[1:45:01] exnihilo777: imagine having fun at work doing your job
[1:45:05] spicykurii: discords and chatting with people for group content is peak wow imo. Last bastion for people to enjoy things PepeHands
[1:45:07] cheetobbob: poor boomkin dps not top3 anymore..  they gut was brutal
[1:45:13] tsm_smaha: @VikingJackAU yeah like druid in wotlk, you gotta change target all the time
[1:46:02] scooby_dru: is gnomer fun? I stopped playing SoD a week after phase 1
[1:46:34] genjimainofc: HUH
[1:46:46] brosephgaming94: i liked murloc boss it felt like it had a real mechanic
[1:46:53] migas03: bfd too easy
[1:47:12] radassbadass69: gnomer bosses take long enough to kill that you actually get to play your class for a minute on fights
[1:47:18] spicykurii: the fact each boss has a mechanic you have to do or die makes it already 1000x more engaging. Crazy what one machnic does
[1:47:37] VikingJackAU: arena pog
[1:47:41] zuugoremorr: bfd = MC     gnomer = BWL. ?
[1:48:06] aleck1776: Hacks
[1:48:06] fukus0da: range maybe
[1:48:28] RanciusAdventures: so curious how SOD Molten Core will be. they are going to have to buff the crap out of it
[1:48:29] exnihilo777: rip buffs
[1:48:45] spicykurii: pumping holy shit top 5 dps
[1:49:27] fukus0da: the lightning hand is directly behind when he casts the knock so thats the safe spot always
[1:49:36] fukus0da: just for reference
[1:49:39] aleck1776: ENGI BOOTS GO
[1:49:46] cnxt1101: rip da buffz
[1:49:54] JoeBango: Miles is pissed
[1:50:16] tsm_smaha: Ahmpy was wiping hard y-day on that chicken dragon boss, kinda curious how these guys will do
[1:50:21] sweatlordkush: casual boomer raid
[1:50:26] wookieenthal: your group has the dps flow

[1:52:22] ikerislock: No SL, I like it
[1:52:33] satrivac: Concetration aura and hellfire no interrupt is amazing aoe threat
[1:52:34] ikerislock: Meta is BiS for Gnomer
[1:52:37] CrixVibez: Lock tank is bis right now
[1:53:01] ikerislock: Hellfire for aoe ya?
[1:53:05] rexysodamnsexy: do you shadowcleave rank up with shadowbolt?
[1:53:17] mysteriousm4n: mage dps Kreygasm
[1:53:24] satrivac: yeah just have healers pump on u and u delete with hellfire
[1:53:28] satrivac: but u need concetration aura
[1:53:32] scooby_dru: EZ Clap
[1:53:41] ikerislock: Kill them before they kill you. Ez
[1:53:58] ikerislock: Right for 100% pb res
[1:54:24] satrivac: @StaysafeTV why dont u want to use hellfire for trash ?
[1:54:47] Randomguy_360: intensity is a meme in raid
[1:54:54] IIDozerII: IIDozerII subscribed with Prime. 
[1:54:59] ikerislock: No it's not lol
[1:54:59] itska97: whats your meta build for tankin?
[1:55:04] Randomguy_360: yes it is
[1:55:07] Randomguy_360: its only useful on trash
[1:55:10] Randomguy_360: waste of points
[1:55:40] satrivac: i mean 10% range on destro spells
[1:55:41] mysteriousm4n: are you guys using the outsider strat?
[1:55:43] satrivac: is waste too
[1:55:46] satrivac: no point
[1:55:54] ikerislock: Exactly
[1:55:58] Randomguy_360: you dont get that talent either
[1:55:59] Rootwell_: emeleaBreadRAVE emeleaBreadRAVE emeleaBreadRAVE
[1:56:00] mysteriousm4n: don't tell the devs this strat staysafe monkaW
[1:56:01] Randomguy_360: in any of the meta builds atm
[1:56:26] satrivac: i will enjoy aoe tanking toping and not losing aggro even to mages with hellfire
[1:56:32] ikerislock: We talking for parsing or clear time?
[1:56:33] dirbagdan: 6 tanks damn
[1:56:39] Randomguy_360: thats fine i will enjoy doing more damage to bosses
[1:57:01] satrivac: to each there own
[1:57:07] mysteriousm4n: my raid did this strat yesterday, probably getting patched
[1:57:09] ikerislock: "Wasted" is subjective
[1:57:16] itska97: are you guys doing the elevator strat?
[1:57:20] itska97: if so lame af
[1:57:21] satrivac: exactly
[1:57:31] Randomguy_360: its kinda not tho
[1:57:40] Randomguy_360: the only thing that matters really is bosses
[1:57:44] danielorccc: where does he LOS
[1:57:46] danielorccc: show pls

[1:58:11] oldirtybrucie: you know why they call him big papi?
[1:58:11] siilver40: free loot
[1:58:15] Mawshaw: @StaysafeTV Idk how it was for you, but STV is a lag nightmare. Feels like a 2008 private server, not even worth doing at this point
[1:58:25] dirbagdan: @SepeIio BASEDCIGAR
[1:59:02] mysteriousm4n: the fact that everyone has to buff warlock pet now is so meme
[1:59:05] migas03: stv is a lagfest
[1:59:06] StoneyYeti: stv isfucked now for locks
[1:59:09] reefo: maybe as more ppl get there is more lag probably
[1:59:09] radassbadass69: its getting laggier because more of the playerbase is hitting 40 and participating
[1:59:10] Mawshaw: It's actually impossible right now
[1:59:11] johnnyhopkinwead1: im in stv right now and it is total garbage lmao literally unplayable
[1:59:12] theguyinthehoodie420: my nickname in highschool was big sloppy bc how i eat hot dogs
[1:59:15] ohioliving: xaryu said same thing
[1:59:24] mysteriousm4n: that sounds also like shit
[1:59:28] satrivac: stv is lagging for na i guess never had any lags on europe and im doing it every 3h
[1:59:30] Mawshaw: Feels like STV has 0 layers
[1:59:45] NameisAlan: tank being top 2 dps kekw
[1:59:46] dirbagdan: blizzard should ask Cisco for their best server and just put everyone on one LUL
[1:59:59] RueRunsIt: sup bro hope your days going well

[2:00:15] Hempwarrior420: so you can fully cheese that last boss then?
[2:00:20] exnihilo777: rare spawn up?
[2:00:25] mysteriousm4n: what happens when the serer management hamster eats the cord for that 1 server? @dirbagdan
[2:00:45] Mawshaw: He only gave us 2 salvage or something, idk if it drops more
[2:00:46] dirbagdan: @mysteriousm4n shhhhhhh don't give me logic.
[2:00:52] hurtenn: its the same rare spawn as in normal gnomer but he just drops 2 salvage things
[2:00:58] mysteriousm4n: ^
[2:00:59] Hempwarrior420: he only drops two salvage
[2:00:59] barbro75: how did last night go

[2:04:29] tsm_smaha: "youll be kiting with me" that sounded just a liiiil bit gay, any thoughts ?
[2:04:48] dirbagdan: @StoneyYeti yeah, but theres also lazy people like me that dontlike leveling alts as much and have been waiting for the boost from 1-25 :P

[5:43:30] wavecadet: WHATS WRONG WITH 1 SHOTTING PEOPLE :) (not biased)
[5:43:30] ToN1c: They probably have to rework the whole loot table anyways because now that all Specs are viable they want Tier sets.
[5:43:34] AxelFromAustralia: they need to increase stamina on all gear game wide by 300%
[5:43:38] Dillsmof: atleast warrs still suck in pvp

[6:09:18] IllusiOGnarly: fucer tarlson
[6:09:53] Zakuras: Tucker is officially labeled as a propagandist, not a journalist. So take it with a grain of salt.
[6:09:58] trebolz: no
[6:10:01] trebolz: it was not
[6:10:12] trebolz: more of a history lesson
[6:10:25] Rindu: yes highly informative
[6:10:26] Zakuras: @trebolz history revisionism "lesson"
[6:10:27] NutterCircus: The media wants everyone to know Tucker almost joined the CIA tooo.
[6:10:34] Humansoup: Very True
[6:10:36] iBanEvader: @Zakuras all journalists are propagandists
[6:10:46] trebolz: @Zakuras depends who you ask
[6:10:53] Humansoup: I liked it
[6:10:54] hathor488: His intention vs what he accomplished
[6:10:56] Chemicalnovah: you can talk about the kid who killed his dad to try and start a militia
[6:10:58] fpsKOLA: Tucky did the right thing, we wanted to hear what was on the mind of the imperialist warchief
[6:10:59] luzzaj: He had no interest in pushing the questions people have already asked in interviews he has had in the past

[6:11:26] HighWarlordofCHAZ: We got an honest look on what Putin thinks.
[6:11:32] kirby0021: history isn't history.... history is the story of the winner
[6:11:33] StueartTV: i mean Russia was the mongols lands not that long ago
[6:11:36] fpsKOLA: It was clearly one sided history/he has a weird obsession with the baltics/poland

[6:12:14] hathor488: You're assuming he believes the reasons he gave
[6:12:15] trebolz: everything is written down and there is no bias with history
[6:12:18] bazzzgg: if we take him on his word why do you think america has always excluded and shit on russia?

[6:12:38] dirbagdan: true
[6:12:56] dusty_goose: POG
[6:13:00] iBanEvader: you can't claim land because it historically has been yours, that's how netanyahu justifies his genocide in Palestine @StaysafeTV

[6:13:42] QuestFor420: tyty

[6:14:19] xenopol51: There is known history
[6:14:29] popoolist: Putin was denying Ukraine its national identity. They do have different languages and cultures. Ukrainians are different people from Russians.  Putin was rationalizing his imeprialism

[6:14:52] fpsKOLA: @iBanEvader the genocide of hamas is happening due to the oct 7th attacks, not because netanyahu believes gaza is apart of israel
[6:14:52] aoe_enjoyer: ottomans I mean
[6:14:54] NutterCircus: They were doing the same to eachother.
[6:14:54] cjadude: get conquered
[6:14:55] kekkyzoot: History is a motive for taking land but it has and always will depends on military power.

[6:15:13] HighWarlordofCHAZ: And now Americans are losing control of their nation because they fear being called "racist".
[6:15:17] diarrerik: every nation in teh world is a product of conquering. by defiition

[6:17:43] Zakuras: @crazyweely issue there is americans dont and cannot fathom the mentality eastern europeans have regarding it. They dont know what it felt like to be under russias terror rule.

[7:07:23] Rimasa: I went solo to STV being lvl 33 and for every kill i was getting 1 blood only, even killing lvl 40s
[7:07:31] Toolt: make stv arena 3v3 with coin rewards
[7:07:34] fuguelah: Yeah sucks you need 5 man group
[7:07:42] MajurDJ: i think it would be cool if they could create layers based on party size for the event. so everyone on your layer is in the same group size as you

[7:08:30] booddhi: Std's are scary
[7:08:38] korjillah: you think you do, but you dont

[7:08:45] Gryphaaa: He was at the turn for my last one
[7:08:52] Nutkingjr: where u can't camp one area
[7:08:55] selectawow: i wasnt able to watch ur stream at the time, what did you think of the putin interview?

[7:09:44] Rimasa: you know why as lvl 33 killing lvl 40s u get 1 coin only?
[7:09:51] dj_clerik: just make it the same rules as bgs: warlocks res with pet already summoned. self cast buffs are free

[7:12:11] ZackorTV: bring back the 5% buff :)
[7:12:11] deywa7: the mount
[7:12:12] korjillah: the mount?
[7:12:12] Steamro11r: lumber turn in for AB rep
[7:12:17] butterzugzug: when you groiup up with 4 other ppl. don't do that and you're not done within 4 times^^
[7:12:18] speedzombie: once they add the arathi basin reward (hopefully) people will do it more
[7:12:18] NutterCircus: P3 STV will be a dead zone.
[7:12:19] asleepnotwoke: SoD feeling half assed, they rushed this out lets be honest. Doing it all on the fly clearly.
[7:12:24] iBanEvader: it should give AB rep
[7:12:25] AlwaysTapLast: can you use bloodmoon mount outside of STV?
[7:12:26] Sowiloo: mount should be 70% PogU
[7:12:28] onlyhc2541: @TheHighsman  same works for drunkness :D
[7:12:34] MajurDJ: there are also people who already have the mount. so how "long term" is it really lol
[7:12:39] bazzzgg: @asleepnotwoke ?
[7:12:41] kalsizzle2: theres a daily for AB rep
[7:12:44] reefo: can we get AB rep from stv?
[7:12:50] iknowido: arathi rep is the slowest its bad lol
[7:12:52] dj_clerik: as someone who hates the event I’m really grateful the awards are so easy to get
[7:12:52] poggersshaman: wasnt there an item they removed
[7:12:54] asleepnotwoke: @bazzzgg way too many bugs what do you mean ?
[7:12:58] lethal_hamster: @StaysafeTV they should add AB rep and raid consumes for silver coins
[7:13:01] white_boi_speedy: That'd be a fun change though. Against Season of Baldgrend design
[7:13:04] kushakai: whats lumber
[7:13:05] Voidbonx: pepeD
[7:13:11] reefo: they bring it back on feb20 with class balance maybe
[7:13:17] bazzzgg: @asleepnotwoke like every online service game lol
[7:13:24] speedzombie: 100 for 1 silver
[7:13:31] wihahz: 100 would be good even
[7:13:34] zaebot3000: @StaysafeTV People will win trade for exalted then :/

[7:13:56] Gryphaaa: Made 255 pveing with a couple 36s lmao couldn't find a good group
[7:14:07] schyrro: Why is it too high?
[7:14:23] bazzzgg: whats it like soloing? is it a nightmare?
[7:14:34] johncrouton44: no
[7:14:38] uhNick: no
[7:14:40] blakeshow: its way too laggy for it to be only 75 rep
[7:14:43] Rimasa: a lot of people only get like a 100, they would not lose walking there and going bacl + 30 min for 75 rep
[7:14:45] zaebot3000: @StaysafeTV People will win trade for exalted then D:
[7:14:50] uhNick: 1k rep
[7:14:53] ChillGrindGaming: why not get the currency for when they add the lumber back?
[7:15:01] athalon: dont you get lik 300 if you win AB?
[7:15:04] WilleySlippery: I hate the grouping as a solo andy
[7:15:05] Gryphaaa: 21K rep
[7:15:14] Steamro11r: but if u win 2 AB in 1/2 hour why even goto STV
[7:15:22] uhNick: seasonal server!
[7:15:27] antimondez: sounds based
[7:15:31] Rimasa: u just cap it to revered and gg
[7:15:34] SaucyRMD: What about the event having a weekly quest that wards AB or WSG rep?
[7:15:39] Gryphaaa: 21,000 rep per copper. Take it or leave it
[7:15:45] dramaqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq: why dont you have your buff?
[7:15:49] dramaqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq: isnt armour good?
[7:15:51] kalsizzle2: do you use synergy or shadow and flame?
[7:15:55] suraxis: weekly reward like the turn in from ashenvale
[7:15:56] beckdev: How is there not a single Season 2 pvp warlock guide out yet?
[7:16:06] Apocco: How was Gnomer
[7:16:07] Trav_Where: has anyone tried a raid group? what happens?
[7:16:10] fuzeb0x_: yes
[7:16:10] AxelFromAustralia: YES
[7:16:11] Bawzhaft: As Alliance you get a Horde Pet like a small orc or smtg
[7:16:12] norfh: ofc
[7:16:12] zaebot3000: YES
[7:16:12] kushakai: yes
[7:16:13] LocoPollo1: yes
[7:16:24] AxelFromAustralia: RAPTOR IS BASED AND IN 60 phase you’ll be goated on the raptor
[7:16:25] fuzeb0x_: orcs look ridiculous on horses anyway
[7:16:27] MajurDJ: if you had the blood raptor you could mount after rezzing LOL
[7:16:28] NutterCircus: thats 100k blood
[7:16:29] Tizzlefix: You make money playing this game, no excuse
[7:16:35] Steamro11r: then u can mount while silenced at the event
[7:16:37] zaebot3000: @StaysafeTV Isnt the STV mounts shittier than the normal lvl 40 mounts?
[7:16:38] batmern_: farm deez nuts emoneyDeez
[7:16:39] speedzombie: @Nutkingjr holy math. its 10k
[7:16:39] kalsizzle2: why not tiger?
[7:16:49] Misterballe: 10k blood
[7:17:00] AxelFromAustralia: hey @staysafetv I think a good idea would be to sell a token that buffs your arathi rep gains for 3h, like 50% more rep
[7:17:04] gamewatcher024: Hi
[7:17:05] WilleySlippery: the raptor looks too much like a normal troll raptor
[7:17:24] Sowiloo: copying my idea
[7:17:26] Sowiloo: Madge
[7:17:27] Steamro11r: incentive
[7:17:29] butterzugzug: no
[7:17:29] Nutkingjr: true
[7:17:30] electric_f33l: NOWAY
[7:17:34] zaebot3000: 65%
[7:17:34] drheathc1: staysafe how are you already 2060 rep into AB? just gaming?
[7:17:34] kekkyzoot: 65%
[7:17:42] fuzeb0x_: make them 100% and then make the lvl 60 mounts fly Kapp
[7:17:42] Nutkingjr: @speedzombie wrong nut! hahha
[7:17:48] gambleragain: after lvling 6 characters to 60 in SSF HC, why am i finding it so boring to lvl my alt to 40
[7:17:53] Chris1108s: people would lose their shit locking 70% mounts behind PvP
[7:17:55] batmern_: make stv mounts fly dragonflight speed Kappa
[7:17:58] Gryphaaa: 55% so people can catch up and look at your mount
[7:18:04] Zoismoe: is the belt bis?
[7:18:10] beckdev: What specc is best in pvp atm?
[7:18:13] NutterCircus: I put in an extra zero hitting keys...
[7:18:56] Aeycka__: agreed
[7:18:57] Aeycka__: 70%
[7:19:01] Bearrdman: if you get the mount on sod servers you get it on classic cata servers Pog
[7:19:10] Sowiloo: feed the autism
[7:19:11] Zoismoe: is the AB belt bis?
[7:19:13] Zoismoe: for casters
[7:19:14] white_boi_speedy: That's what wcl is for
[7:19:16] radassbadass69: lets give them somethin to be autistic about
[7:19:35] saberful: what server you on brother ?
[7:19:37] batmern_: that stv 65% mount speed with the carrot on a stick gonna go hard
[7:19:47] saberful: tonytooDance
[7:19:53] verrack714: is this song from the matrix?
[7:19:58] Voidbonx: @saberful Pog
[7:20:05] aoe_enjoyer: how much sp do you have?
[7:20:20] aoe_enjoyer: nice
[7:20:37] theblackzzprodigy: Wheres this location on the map?
[7:20:56] Humansoup: I agree
[7:21:00] avoidedneXt: haha yeah thats so true
[7:21:04] normageqq: lack of pve grinds is annoying tbh
[7:21:07] avoidedneXt: OMG DUD 5% LETS GO
[7:21:09] Biddy_: can horde use the cat mount?
[7:21:12] Humansoup: Just a little somethin
[7:21:37] avoidedneXt: imagine being the peasant on 60% speed
[7:21:50] sykey7: did they remove lumber for silver to get ab rep?
[7:21:50] dj_clerik: the event gets me so tilted. I’m glad I don’t have to do it for more than 1 day
[7:21:55] avoidedneXt: no i was for reals
[7:21:56] Gealls: Would be nice if they fixed AB rep quest too
[7:21:56] Steamro11r: make it 100% and usable in STV only lol
[7:21:59] avoidedneXt: i play
[7:22:08] Voidbonx: spreadsheet warriors Prayge
[7:22:11] reefo: i love 5%
[7:22:14] ChillGrindGaming: 50% better
[7:22:18] mintcookie_vajankle: Not even 5%, closer to 1-2%
[7:22:19] aoe_enjoyer: you get the +5% mount to run a muthafucka down
[7:22:20] saberful: tonytooThinking
[7:22:37] Voidbonx: KEKL
[7:22:59] avoidedneXt: man i cheesed the event in one session the moment i got 40
[7:23:03] avoidedneXt: i didnt even play it properly
[7:23:04] NutterCircus: SS will farm something on the chance it "may" pay off.
[7:23:14] dj_clerik: spent like 36 hours grinding rep boxes KEKL
[7:23:43] saberful: hell yea
[7:23:50] Sowiloo: fr 4cap
[7:24:04] XarcTV: :)
[7:24:41] normageqq: you think the matchmaking changes have been good?
[7:24:43] Vicente_Prime: that druid is being a ppussy
[7:24:58] Sowiloo: Deadge
[7:25:02] avoidedneXt: its got that raid log vibes
[7:25:07] pitbullcgn87: Leveling Alts :D
[7:25:08] butterzugzug: every sweater will say that
[7:25:11] avoidedneXt: you're right
[7:25:11] reefo: p2 has less
[7:25:17] Voidbonx: it's just the dumb raid
[7:25:18] mikyki: i had high hopes for this phase too
[7:25:18] batmern_: its just leveling alts
[7:25:18] RodanQQ: there nothing to do now besides raid log
[7:25:19] Vicente_Prime: have you sold all the plants already? @StaysafeTV
[7:25:20] osopolar1977: deadge
[7:25:21] elithius01: They really need to add more rewards to STV
[7:25:24] WilleySlippery: it's ok to run out of shit
[7:25:25] reefo: we want lv60
[7:25:26] Riv_VK: 4 alts have the sleeping bag already for me LUL
[7:25:27] butterzugzug: p2 is good for the normal player
[7:25:29] jungelregla: Just tried to quest in shimmering flats, every single mob is taken by a mage bot, literally every single one,  like 30+ on my layer
[7:25:30] AlwaysTapLast: really only thing to do is farming the PVP reps
[7:25:34] batmern_: thats why they have self found in 2 weeks lol
[7:25:39] omarali118: Some of the people running the show for SoD have nothing but a horrible resume of adding bad things to retail
[7:25:41] radassbadass69: that's okay, everyone can accomplish their goals in game and still have a life
[7:25:44] AlwaysTapLast: they didnt do anything with the box rep
[7:25:48] abruptdecayO_O: im not even 40 yet
[7:25:49] avoidedneXt: they need rated bgs
[7:25:56] reefo: @AlwaysTapLast saw some sick lv60 epics wondering if their power will be strong when we get there, probably
[7:25:57] castond: false, we have 40 hrs of gold farming every week to purely fund raid consumes because everything is so expensive
[7:25:58] taliwoush: I dunno how pugs are gonna do last boss
[7:26:01] dj_clerik: the stv event has the same problem as 10 man bg premades imo. most people aren’t doing it to have epic pvp battles. they’re there for the gear
[7:26:02] Tizzlefix: I'm not even 40 yet lmaooo
[7:26:04] reefo: for exalted rep
[7:26:04] taliwoush: That shit is rough even with a guild
[7:26:04] sweatlordkush: play paladin
[7:26:05] omarali118: Time to learn to RP
[7:26:23] Vicente_Prime: cringe druid
[7:26:31] Schmitty88: 1 character andys dont play as frequent as you and others. 1 character andys dont havent played 8 hrs a day for the past week
[7:26:34] aoe_enjoyer: boomkins ICANT
[7:26:35] cjadude: get conquered tony
[7:26:38] sweatlordkush: LUL
[7:26:42] avoidedneXt: formerly tonytwotap, now tonyfourtap
[7:26:43] milkvodka: he thought he was that guy
[7:26:46] saberful: he needs to go feral now :/
[7:26:51] dj_clerik: look at me. I’m the boomer now
[7:26:52] Sowiloo: no more 1.2k crits KEKL
[7:26:54] sweatlordkush: tonytentap
[7:27:04] aoe_enjoyer: b OMEGALUL OMEGALUL m
[7:27:25] Plokoon100: yea you do
[7:27:30] Humansoup: Based
[7:27:39] WilleySlippery: i never ran out of things to do in p1
[7:27:57] Chris1108s: ur the canary in the mine
[7:28:00] NutterCircus: Some of this shit is mind numbing.
[7:28:14] Voidbonx: time to hop on palworld
[7:28:25] Khornester: hey yo
[7:28:26] reefo: i'm rank5, 6/6 gnomer, all runes unlocked, have nothing to do. starting over on rogue
[7:28:28] sweatlordkush: time to become a weeb furry and play palworld
[7:28:34] omarali118: What do you think of the people running SoD? @StaysafeTV
[7:28:34] Thatlaxbro: Ive already had people quit phase 2 cause they got burnt out on phase 1 and just dont wanna play SoD anymore
[7:28:39] aoe_enjoyer: the player base just wants to complain so their salivating at p2 getting boring KEKW
[7:28:40] muss101: then you can finaly play the game
[7:28:46] fluxxtee: That's why ssf drops soon
[7:28:47] NutterCircus: I would die laughing if Staysafe streamed palworld.
[7:28:52] taliwoush: Like why wouldnt they put in some cool cosmetic/gear tokens in Uldaman/RFD? Gives some stuff to do outside raid/pvp
[7:28:53] Itshighnoonwotlk: hey
[7:28:56] djbetrayer: yea i just need tidal charm then my druid is done with this phase p much
[7:29:01] reefo: i still like p2 tho
[7:29:07] nosefinger: i finished the game twice in phase 2 :/
[7:29:09] craboskai: p2 has no content KEKL
[7:29:11] osopolar1977: I thought it was gonna be more world bosses, not some simple raid
[7:29:12] dramaqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq: why arent u doing blood moon?
[7:29:18] reefo: yep
[7:29:19] casualfriendly: dontu think streamers are a bit doomsayers cause they (you) actually pump the game as a job so all u need is to pump the content all day every day so thats how streamers feel like theres nothing left to do? im only 32 i dont really see myself bored anytime soon. no offense on this ofc jsut curious
[7:29:20] abruptdecayO_O: they buffed dungeon gear no?
[7:29:25] HighWarlordofCHAZ: Stare PianoTime For content ?
[7:29:28] NutterCircus: BFD loot was too good.
[7:29:28] w3zb0: Dungeon spamming just gave me brain rot
[7:29:29] avoidedneXt: im coping for phase 3 to jam packed with shit
[7:29:30] zaebot3000: @StaysafeTV I feel like I have SOOOO much to do. I've got every single class lvl 25-40 except pally. I still need to lvl 6 more alts to 40
[7:29:32] mmickkuu: can we see your talents
[7:29:32] athalon: yea there isnt really a gear grind outside of raid
[7:29:39] adverick12: staysafe which talents do u recommend for tanking GNOMER
[7:29:47] HighWarlordofCHAZ: Not enough things to do. :/
[7:29:54] tacomuncher23: dungeon token gear vendor
[7:29:55] taliwoush: Literally no one is doing ulda or RFD, some content available for this phase levels, wish they gave something
[7:30:03] HighWarlordofCHAZ: Titanforging ?
[7:30:10] wtspotions: great idea
[7:30:10] dj_clerik: they should add more quality of life abilities, make them rare and put them in rfd, sm and ulda @staysafetv
[7:30:10] nosefinger: cant believe i quit university for this phase and im already out of things to do and want to go back to university 2 days after i quit :(
[7:30:12] taliwoush: Like a token in WoTLK gear/dual spec
[7:30:14] electric_f33l: KEKW
[7:30:16] wtspotions: would be sick
[7:30:17] NutterCircus: They could do so much with SoD.
[7:30:18] reefo: i would love that
[7:30:19] soix__: bruh no
[7:30:20] Voidbonx: that would be awesome
[7:30:24] indocl0ud: sorry no gathering proffessions allowed
[7:30:26] drunkyucko: We just need more risk/reward in this game. Everything gets stale without risk
[7:30:34] MykeyP: @StaysafeTV truuuu, give people more ways to just play 1 character, instead of having a lot of alts
[7:30:35] Biddy_: would rather dual spec
[7:30:38] avoidedneXt: you should make a video about your ideas for sod
[7:30:40] aoe_enjoyer: i want an STV page style quest where we put together a dictionary so we can understand the opposite faction and talk shit
[7:30:53] osopolar1977: drug test blizzard
[7:31:08] Humansoup: Yep
[7:31:24] tacomuncher23: solid idea
[7:31:42] mattbarz989: or the crafted items
[7:31:49] taliwoush: The world would feel more alive also
