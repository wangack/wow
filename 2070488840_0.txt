[0:38:53] TheRyanHawkins: 60k is like 1k a month
[0:39:12] CrucifyMTG: 1k a month is shit
[0:39:12] shadowz04322: !server
[0:39:12] Nightbot: SoD NA = CRUSADER STRIKE - SoD EU ( soon ) LIVING FLAME - HC NA = DEFIAS PILLAGER ( ONLYFANGS ) - HC EU: STITCHES HORDE - WOTLK: GEHENNAS HORDE & FIREMAW ALLIANCE - CLASSIC ERA: FIREMAW HORDE ( 9 ears mage )

[0:39:34] Zenlyn: did u get ur 7am gnomer done i had to sleep
[0:39:35] shadowz04322: crusader NA horde 100g = 12 eu avg so 2k gold would be 240 euro a night
[0:39:36] giagin420: nah 200 g is like £25 , 1000 = £100? 60k = 6k ??
[0:39:36] ogSaltdaddy: It feels like you're forgetting that this is a videogame
[0:39:36] LuxzGaming: 1k is like my rent here in dk
[0:39:39] stevierc: 100 gold is like £7
[0:39:45] valrash1981: That's why there are bot farms.
[0:39:55] TheRyanHawkins: You guys arent taking into consideration cleaning the gold to sell without getting banned
[0:39:56] valrash1981: RMT ruins games.

[0:40:39] TheRyanHawkins: Amexx it freaked me out too
[0:40:45] Xclosetnerd: gold farming is lucrative for those in 3rd world countries. not really worth for 1st world. it’s prob worth to run the website and that whole aspect
[0:40:50] TheRyanHawkins: I was like wtf its not daytime in sweden
[0:40:51] ogSaltdaddy: depends on where you live tho
[0:41:02] Ramsaybolton92: 1 kwd here 100 eypyt gnhe
[0:41:03] Zenlyn: bro i know some ppl who live in egypt who rmt and they said when they tip their delivery driver $5 it makes their month
[0:41:13] ogSaltdaddy: Egypt has cheap areas, but tourist areas bring the avg costs up, but if you go to the boonies its cheap af
[0:41:16] Zenlyn: cos its just SO much for them but he doesnt care about $5
[0:41:23] shadowz04322: it gets profitable when you scale it up, run a small farm by yourself, 10+ accounts farming nonstop..

[0:42:11] rogue_commet: dollar has 3 times the value in egypt
[0:42:15] felsteam: poor grandpa only has 10 subs a month for a living
[0:42:17] rogue_commet: so its 3 times cheaper
[0:42:18] LuxzGaming: Do you support liverpool then?
[0:42:19] valrash1981: 10 bots each making 1k a month, that would be big for 1 person most anywhere in the world (1k$ that is).
[0:42:22] shadowz04322: OMEGALUL
[0:42:23] LuxzGaming: piece of shittah

[0:45:09] Zenlyn: ahh my bad, i heard somewhere sweden has really high tax though
[0:45:09] shadowz04322: Heyge
[0:45:12] hisdud3ness: @ogSaltdaddy Denmark is 55% xD
[0:45:15] ogSaltdaddy: but ofc you have taxes for other than income too, as for food for example
[0:45:26] drozzzze: he likes to look at feet
[0:45:42] shadowz04322: big chopper Pog
[0:45:48] ogSaltdaddy: @hisdud3ness TIL. But still you have to factor in other taxes too. But I would still say that there is no _big_ difference between DK <-> SE <-> FI
[0:45:49] Beinet75: If you earn like 100k dollars a year in Norway, you pay like 35% rent I guess. Denmark is not 55%. I dont believe that.
[0:46:07] shrroom: just tax evade 4Head

[0:46:39] zlatanontibia: sweden is like 50 % after a certaiin treshold
[0:46:51] ogSaltdaddy: "Denmark's top statutory personal income tax rate is 55.9 percent, Norway's is 38.2 percent, and Sweden's is 52.3 percent."

[0:47:24] thunderxmvp: @ogSaltdaddy Thats straight up false, after the 2021 election, Norways top marginal rate is now 52%
[0:47:48] LuxzGaming: @ogSaltdaddy Yea but thats only if you earn a lot of money
[0:47:50] Beinet75: top tax, you can`t really compare it to that? What is the salary to get to 55%?
[0:47:54] COMMEdesRATS: duo stream with ps
[0:47:56] lunearis1: ofc

[0:49:19] ogSaltdaddy: @LuxzGaming Yes, that is kind of the discussion. BUT the statistic I sent takes into consideration: Individual taxes Corporate taxes Social security contributions Property tax Consumption taxes Other  Anyways realistically talking about taxes you cannot only look at income tax, or you only see half of the truth
[0:49:21] cripples42069: he is talking about the girls!!!

[0:50:56] LesGoTV: @Ziqoftw you think you could reach 99.5 + avg parsing on a mage if you try went tryhard on pve for a month?
[0:51:04] Beinet75: Swedish people pay in average 30% taxes, so not 55%... how can you pull out a number of 55%? just because some has to pay 55% because of some weird income in special cases, you can not just say that the tax is 55%. I am over it, i stop now.
[0:51:17] BlastBeatGo: mind contraol has DC'd since like 2009

[0:51:43] ogSaltdaddy: @trxcksuit Yes, Scorch gest 4% better crit chance than fireball, it costs less mana and 2 scorches dmg is quite literally avg of 1 fireball (while cast time for both is 3 sec). So you get more hot streak proccs etc

[0:53:38] felsteam: nice dead on arival KEKW
[0:53:40] BlastBeatGo: KEKW
[0:53:45] nailerak: but you can still control the funds the public pension cash gets invested in, right?
[0:53:48] ogSaltdaddy: @Ziqoftw The funny thing people don't understand (usually) is that there is taxation  even for the companies for paying you salary
[0:54:24] ogSaltdaddy: Or "usually" in Nordics, in Finland for example if I get 3K salary the actual cost for my work is 5-6k for employer, then I even pay tax for my salary so its double taxated
[0:54:28] hisdud3ness: YEP same here we have base pension too, then supplementary pension, you choose how much you contribute and employer also contributes towards this, usually monthly amount after you work for a while
[0:54:36] zak618: did an easy strat for this one last night
[0:55:15] ogSaltdaddy: Yee, but people who aren't in high enough positions (or aren't running their own company) don't know this usually
[0:55:17] zak618: split the dps into two groups, stand on opposite sides of the boss max melee. One healer on each side and they are the only ones who move back to bait static
[0:55:29] shykuar: its the same in italy they succ us
[0:55:29] Psxena: Pshero want to play on EU Living Flame soon..dont know what "soon" means, but at this time Living Flame is open for new Characters ;)
[0:55:48] Beinet75: because of employers tax yes
[0:55:51] ogSaltdaddy: @Ziqoftw the google thing even calculates consumption taxes, so most should be covered in it
[0:55:55] mrciannu: @Psxena soon can be soon or never KEKZ
[0:56:08] sadentv: salary - pension contribution (this does not include the employer’s contribution) - social contribution - taxes = net salary
[0:56:09] ogSaltdaddy: Yeah but even employers tax is a taxation :D
[0:56:14] hisdud3ness: @ogSaltdaddy gross and super gross salary I guess?
[0:56:38] rogue_commet: self employed means one thing, you are paying your own health insurance
[0:56:39] ogSaltdaddy: Dunno the term for it unfortunately, as english is not my primary language =D
[0:56:46] sadentv: pension contributions usually has two components (employers part + employee’s part)
[0:56:47] Korvynah: im on standby for the last boss ragequit
[0:56:49] rogue_commet: having your own company is not self employed
[0:56:50] hisdud3ness: I guess that's what we call it in Czech republic xD roughly translated
[0:56:50] Korvynah: o7
[0:56:52] Psxena: @mrciannu i hope soon :D
[0:56:58] Hozitojones: you have a company? :D
[0:56:58] spicycheetosfingers: in the uk at least the difference of ltd is you have more protection if you company fails (i.e. if ltd they cant take your house away)
[0:57:05] zak618: split the dps into two groups, stand on opposite sides of the boss max melee. One healer on each side and they are the only ones who move back to bait static 󠀀
[0:57:13] zak618: melee and ranged stand together
[0:57:18] Beinet75: what is taxes in us? to you us folks out there?
[0:57:21] shykuar: essaying
[0:57:29] mrciannu: @Psxena i made that command months ago, still didnt happen lol
[0:57:37] shadowz04322: you dont need to have 6 people outside, only 1 guy per group needs to soak, rest can be melee
[0:57:56] sadentv: @spicycheetosfingers most countries have this type of company “type”
[0:58:11] spicycheetosfingers: cool .. i wasnt sure :D
[0:58:40] Raigor2610: @Ziqoftw  where is bis list for pvp frost mage?
[0:58:46] ogSaltdaddy: @Ziqoftw If you get tired of sweden later I would suggest to check Latvia. Riga is an amazing city with low COL.
[0:58:46] sadentv: usually you need to have some minimum profit / company worth to be able to.
[0:59:20] zak618: there is a strat with zero downtime for dps
[1:00:07] shadowz04322: that does not matter bro
[1:00:28] shadowz04322: you dont need to be tightly stacked to soak a bounce, it has unlimited range + goes on next closest target
[1:01:04] zak618: you guys are making it 10x harder
[1:01:18] zak618: split the dps into two groups, stand on opposite sides of the boss max melee. One healer on each side and they are the only ones who move back to bait static
[1:01:23] halphasz: this is literally like Gurtogg in Black Temple
[1:01:40] Koshintu: oh bloodboil PepeLaugh
[1:01:54] welioos: when is the duel tournament?

[1:02:03] shakathedon: no he means all stand in melee
[1:02:03] zak618: no, the groups stand right next to the boss
[1:02:05] Duleriumm: yep KEKW
[1:02:09] shadowz04322: he means 9 people in melee and only 1 guy soaking
[1:02:09] DelverQ: @teleportsz 謝謝您的贈禮訂閱！
[1:02:09] zak618: and only the healers move out

[1:02:29] TheRyanHawkins: Time for you to heal Zigo
[1:02:31] ogSaltdaddy: @Ziqoftw why are you separating caster groups? We always do it so that we put 2 grps infront of each other on same side and that you its easier to see which grp is closer to boss
[1:02:33] vbx93: Chatting
[1:02:37] zak618: ranged and melee stack together, only heals move out
[1:02:46] petethemyth: is this a rerun vod of week 1 gnomer?

[1:02:49] Duleriumm: the pug last night looking better than the viewer raid HUH
[1:02:51] ogSaltdaddy: so we have 2 grps like you do, moving forward/ backward but we are on same side so we see distance easier
[1:03:05] Korvynah: Ziqo i think the wipes will go away if we get some gratitude in the chat for the content creator

[1:34:08] zak618: druid trying to tank the sheep took a million un-needed damage
[1:34:10] MarkyOchoa: huh? no. you just ignore the sheep period.

[1:34:50] Soul_Linked: :)
[1:35:01] jesusjammys: You just kite the others and sheep never hits anything 😂
[1:35:05] zak618: use mage armour instead of ice, should help a bit with mana
[1:35:17] broodjedollo: chicken does mad dmg with Cluck
[1:35:24] hiro25000: sheep will always try to join the other mobs. Dragon does a overheat every 25% dealing huge amount of damage on melee. You can have a offtank take drake and bring him 30yard away from other mobs every 25%
[1:35:25] broodjedollo: tank dragon and squirrel together, let offtank take chicken
[1:35:29] zak618: ezclap this time

[1:37:43] MarkyOchoa: druid back on sheep?
[1:37:47] Octagon3: is frost any good in pvp right now?
[1:37:48] hiro25000: leave that sheep alone
[1:37:54] jesusjammys: LOL the druid is on the sheep again
[1:37:56] Spwaffles: that druid needs to get off the sheep
[1:37:58] hiro25000: tell your druid to let the sheep live his life

[1:53:24] feistygoat37: also Ziqo, you clicked just for mana. you need to save your click for when bombs come
[1:53:41] nailerak: mana pot on CD, etc
[1:53:46] ogSaltdaddy: All classes can 1shot bombs, hunter with ranged is only ony that doesn't go oom and clears them fast

[2:05:25] kataxxx: saturday night pepeJAM
[2:05:29] ffslevi: PauseChamp
[2:05:36] pbj_time: rofl man
[2:05:36] feistygoat37: is the Druid taunting?
[2:05:51] COMMEdesRATS: Wokege
[2:05:52] Hawksworthers: Shitto hunterssss
[2:05:54] pbj_time: these tanks are inting
[2:06:05] kataxxx: KEKwAIT
[2:06:12] thebookeu: KEKW
[2:06:13] zak618: its a 5/6 angle, F
[2:06:16] danparsonss: on the fire phase we get the hunter pet to taunt boss at 60% for tank to drop stacks
[2:06:16] darthvaxis: this is karma, justice for hydra!
[2:06:31] sillenffs: MORE DOTS
[2:06:37] Doggoh_Xdarise: because they can
[2:06:44] nutclop: cursed raid
[2:07:01] Hawksworthers: 5/6 angle
[2:07:07] feistygoat37: tell druid not to taunt
[2:07:12] yaybump: Okay. mages blink and get buttons and ONLY focus bombs. Have 1 hunter ALSO clicking and bombs. Everyone else worry about boss mages and hunter DONT even target boss.
[2:07:21] sillenffs: can you go speech with tactics, my friend needs to hear
[2:07:23] ffslevi: KEKVibe
[2:07:29] yaybump: Tank run at furnace to midigate stacks. Should only need 1 tank
[2:07:38] feistygoat37: druid is taunting when the fire is going
[2:07:41] yaybump: Dont even need 2 tanks. I single tank it aas a wwwawrrior
[2:07:44] Nightbot: Bring balance to your setup - get the Harmony PC today! https://starforgepc.com/Ziqo
[2:07:44] pbj_time: so like during the first furance blast, the shaman tank didnt have enough threat, you got aggro of the boss, so the feral taunted when fire was going
[2:07:45] darthvaxis: hydra's group 1 shot this shit
[2:07:47] thebookeu: who was on traps?
[2:07:47] Kr0niskTv: you just need 1 tank
[2:07:48] feistygoat37: and pulls the agro towards the rest of the melee
[2:07:49] DJ_SmyleZ: having any fun in p2?
[2:07:51] vbx93: i need a Paint of that
[2:07:53] Kr0niskTv: wtf
[2:07:56] yaybump: I can single tank this as fight as warrior.
[2:07:57] feistygoat37: yep.
[2:08:10] pbj_time: this is painful to watch
[2:08:11] yaybump: Can run from furnace. Dont even need 2 tanks.
[2:08:18] ogSaltdaddy: ACtually I think rogue tank would be good for this fight
[2:08:23] theeasytitan: Sounds good bro

[2:08:27] WeAreALLhuman: hunter SSSsss
[2:08:28] feistygoat37: but that doesn't look good in the logs.
[2:08:30] V37CH: cant load in
[2:08:31] Krohnk: Tjo bre!
[2:08:32] sillenffs: why hunters on bombs??
[2:08:34] pbj_time: if you have ONE person 100% dedicated to killing bombs, doing ZERO dps you will clear
[2:08:42] danparsonss: we solo tank it with a shaman
[2:08:46] thebookeu: you can intervene away from breath if you are warrior
[2:08:48] millinoid: sham tank is omega bis for this entire dungeon tbh
[2:08:50] yaybump: Yes Kite boss. Its a single tank if you kite it
[2:08:56] millinoid: can kite boss then grounding and drop stacks
[2:08:56] danparsonss: but the hunter pet taunts to drop his stacks
[2:08:59] ogSaltdaddy: The shaman just did succesfully kite the breath once
[2:09:07] feistygoat37: lol
[2:09:14] DJ_SmyleZ: it’s fine. said just like a disappointed father
[2:09:19] stefanskijr: pshero should stop talkin smack to u cuh after he got clapped in the makg tourney
[2:09:26] yaybump: As soon as you see cast. start running. DPS needs to drop dps during furnace cast
[2:09:38] Zevioi: This is great lol
[2:09:44] pbj_time: really not sure why you have 4 healers
[2:10:30] thebookeu: its a experimental comp
[2:10:42] vegasdismay: yo @Ziqoftw whats good man
[2:10:47] ogSaltdaddy: Yeah 4 healers cripples the dps too much
[2:11:05] DJ_SmyleZ: isn’t the death run to gnomer super far? or did they make it closer for sod?
[2:11:21] ogSaltdaddy: yeah but rather have 1 mage go geren and AB with missiles and other stay fire
[2:11:28] ogSaltdaddy: regen*
[2:11:35] DaaamnTV: rule 1. dont be garbanzo
[2:11:37] ogSaltdaddy: and the fire one then gets spellpower too
[2:12:02] sillenffs: dps on boss makes it easyer though, the shitters do bombs and pumpers go boss :D
[2:12:12] ogSaltdaddy: by all metrics it makes sense
[2:12:25] vegasdismay: easyer? @sillenffs  oh naah
[2:12:58] sillenffs: @vegasdismay as in faster = less mana issues
[2:13:08] thebookeu: huge
[2:13:09] theeasytitan: ziqoGob
[2:13:14] feistygoat37: Ziqo is wasting his click when the bombs are not coming out.
[2:13:27] feistygoat37: I know he needs mana but that is part of the problem.
[2:13:39] ThePingDuck: because tanks fail. You should have the OT be on the other side of the melee so when they taunt early it don't hit melee.
[2:13:56] kreeezy: Dps is shittah
[2:14:20] DaaamnTV: thats what i call garbanzo hunters
[2:14:21] vegasdismay: no dps from hunters?
[2:14:39] mrbooshiama: what even is that hunters dmg LUL
[2:14:40] vegasdismay: I was talking about your spelling, but ye @sillenffs
[2:14:49] feistygoat37: is this a 5/6 week lockout for them?
[2:14:54] zak618: let stina pump
[2:15:00] mrbooshiama: omg u have 2 hunters under 100 dps
[2:15:02] zak618: him on bombs is bad
[2:15:12] feistygoat37: they were told to focus bombs.
[2:15:15] gravitymang: I gotta say this fight is definitely better with good dps. We did it on tuesday with not great DPS and we had a rough go at it. Got it done after like 6 attempts but it was tough.
[2:15:16] vbx93: well if hunter are supposed to click as melee, how would they do any dmg
[2:15:23] mrbooshiama: worst part over with the rest of the fight is breeze
[2:15:26] DaaamnTV: their dmg sucks but at least i hpope warrior sunders
[2:15:33] sillenffs: @vegasdismay lol thanks i appreciate it xD
[2:15:50] vbx93: this boss also has like a billion armor
[2:16:20] guldaneeee: zizoo is poping off sheesh
[2:16:44] Pilky02: the boss hp doesnt move lol
[2:17:18] Hawksworthers: Hold
[2:17:44] kataxxx: peepoDJ
[2:17:50] warriorbaby93: fresh trim!
[2:18:20] shakathedon: ddisease cleaning kekw
[2:18:23] Zevioi: There oom
[2:18:24] shakathedon: drop the totem boi
[2:18:29] danparsonss: tell him to drop the totem
[2:18:50] sillenffs: your problem is DPS not the bombs, put all the shitters on bombs and pumpers on boss to have faster phase changes
[2:19:03] big_dave_raves: Gnomer hard mode
[2:19:06] thebookeu: good try
[2:19:14] vbx93: mage/priest doing bombs hunter on boss
[2:19:21] thebookeu: why not have hunter on boss and druid with sunfire on bombs
[2:19:23] zak618: stina on boss, druid on boss
[2:19:24] joeychrist315: there an arcane mage dam/healer build that’s OP
[2:19:28] thebookeu: yes sunfire druid works
[2:19:30] zak618: druid on bombs*
[2:19:30] 13lackjesustv: need a shaman in the tank group for cleanse totem
[2:19:35] Doggoh_Xdarise: feral druid can do catform sunfire
[2:19:44] bannerwow: None of them are parsing tbh
[2:19:58] ogSaltdaddy: No
[2:20:02] gangletronic: Tank go DW -- use grounding totem phase 1 - use decoy totem phase 2 - use disease cleansing phase 3 --  use resist totems
[2:20:03] shadowz04322: 150 ish hp
[2:20:04] vbx93: hunter on boss make it easier 100%
[2:20:04] thebookeu: afaik sunfire druid can solo bomb duty with 30% move speed in cat form
[2:20:05] Zevioi: @bannerwow KEKZ
[2:20:17] 13lackjesustv: tell the shaman to drop cleanse totem
[2:20:18] ogSaltdaddy: Sccorch is best but its not good either
[2:20:19] shadowz04322: its 159 i think
[2:20:25] stefanskijr: its 156 health u donkeys
[2:20:27] wheelofdoom: maybe if u wann op him sure thing
[2:20:27] PPetition: bis is a druid just killing them imo
[2:20:32] sillenffs: lowest dps classes on bombs
[2:20:35] zak618: repair downstairs, chest is broken
[2:20:35] ogSaltdaddy: Shaman solotanked last time too tbh
[2:20:54] stefanskijr: and tell pshero to calm down or remind him of what u did in the makg
[2:20:55] ogSaltdaddy: If shaman just kites properly he never gets high stacks
[2:20:56] snittenokay: klat
[2:21:03] irishprodigy1: bro you got as pvp build yet
[2:21:04] wheelofdoom: ye druid should be go crazy Kappa Kappa

[2:21:22] Kirby_The_Pink: peepoPls
[2:21:31] thebookeu: KEKW
[2:21:36] gangletronic: Tank go DW -- use grounding totem phase 1 - use decoy totem phase 2 - use disease cleansing phase 3 -- use resist totems
[2:21:52] ogSaltdaddy: But I would deffo go regen and arcane blast, it is so mana efficient that you will litterally slap and heal a shitton
[2:22:01] leetsu1: love ur 80s taste
[2:22:03] apostolis131313: 3 day reset right?
[2:22:05] wheelofdoom: lets go back for the native moment. we need more activity rn :D
[2:22:21] thebookeu: 6/6 angle wanted
[2:22:33] mealtiime: i am starting to think that raids with PS are cursed
[2:22:45] thebookeu: priest should pop abolish on tank at start of p3
[2:22:52] ThePingDuck: is pally using fire aura?
[2:22:54] Hawksworthers: STV event and raids with Ps confirmed cursed
[2:22:55] revognaH: just tuned in any good loot ?
[2:23:01] lupper05: ziqoGob ziqoGob
[2:23:05] delirious555: Maria Magdalena Kreygasm
[2:23:15] zak618: one lance, one sunfire should kill
[2:23:15] foolsendit: i think there is sham totem for all phases right?
[2:23:23] shakathedon: youll need 3 lances (assuming none crit)
[2:23:24] wyldbylli: wuttup
[2:23:36] Kirby_The_Pink: wideVIBE

[2:23:45] ogSaltdaddy: @Ziqoftw 3x icelance is over 180 mana right? Scorch is 100 and 100% kills
[2:23:50] thebookeu: 3 set is: im not giving it to pshero
[2:23:54] thebookeu: what a set bonus
[2:23:55] Zevioi: KEKZ
[2:24:07] zak618: no mana gems, sadge
[2:24:14] flakzcs: beautiful music
[2:24:17] thebookeu: druid forgot to change to sunfire KEKW
[2:25:23] gangletronic: grounding totemmmmm
[2:25:35] Hawksworthers: Its an org portal angle
[2:25:38] vattenapa: what is dps dying to xd
[2:25:40] thebookeu: tanks should call swap or melee should move. boss has massive cleave
[2:25:40] big_dave_raves: have pet taunt on the fire breath it's way easier
[2:25:53] thebookeu: yes he cleaves
[2:25:57] ogSaltdaddy: even 2 icelance is 135 mana and takes 2 gcd so speed is slower than scorch no?
[2:26:01] thebookeu: tank swap needs to happen on same direction
[2:26:03] LittleTim_: finally some relatable content on twitch
[2:26:27] yaybump: HUNTER AND MAGES ON BOMBS
[2:26:39] thebookeu: @Ziqoftw tell tank to be taunt swaping it without turning the boss when boss turns around he cleaves the melee
[2:26:48] yaybump: YOU KITE BOSS AROUND DOOR
[2:26:55] battlenetq: i think this guy doesnt know what he is talking about
[2:26:56] yaybump: from 1 side to other
[2:27:01] big_dave_raves: pet taunt on breath it takes no damage no need for all thos
[2:27:17] Viccili: i feel guilty if you guys 5/6
[2:27:21] ashecatchdeeznutz: are your hunters BM Ziqo?

[2:29:16] faceroll52: Regen is good with this build tho
[2:29:22] faceroll52: just heal with AB and missiles
[2:29:23] MarkyOchoa: your healing is fine. mechanics are scuffed af
[2:29:27] ogSaltdaddy: Regen > chronostatic , you even get spellpower then so you rly blast dmg and it upps healing a lot too
[2:29:31] warriorbaby93: This is a tune!
[2:29:35] cypherdk94: tank boss breath in a circle around middle so people can parse and hit bombs same time

[2:31:59] DasAutoChat: FeelsBadMan
[2:32:04] zak618: ppc
[2:32:04] ogSaltdaddy: at least one of these priest is running max rank renew instead of rank 1 + letting pom do the work
[2:32:20] bannerwow: Tank dont know how to juggle aggro on the fire thing
[2:32:21] thebookeu: KEKW
[2:32:23] lateloll: idk how a priest doesnt play dispersion..
[2:32:24] Stars69: after the breath, threat resets
[2:32:27] 775anthonymike: mellee got to watch there aggro while kiting
[2:32:30] Stars69: doesn't i?
[2:32:31] faceroll52: Druid was still tanking, and died
[2:32:44] VersusGamesFL: threat does a soft reset when he breathes
[2:32:47] gangletronic: @Ziqoftw its not a threat reset. if tank runs too far he will swap
[2:32:50] yaybump: THREAT RESETS AND YOU CAN GET AGRO SO EASY WHEN YOU ATTACK DURING BREATH
[2:32:52] thebookeu: feigning on breath KEKW
[2:32:52] VandettaOfficial: yeah very soft
[2:32:57] Xereseu: OT should just taunt straight after breath ends its easy also good for stack resetting
[2:33:09] ObrezKnight: if shaman tank is ranging sprocket fire he aint pulling aggro
[2:33:10] 13lackjesustv: its not reset but the tank need to kite so he cant keep up aggro
[2:33:11] VandettaOfficial: yeah resetting stacks is most important
[2:33:25] 13lackjesustv: dps need to chill during flamethrower
[2:33:27] segdeg: any 1 knowe where kunge are
[2:33:37] Stars69: you can outrun the cast
[2:33:40] vattenapa: just taunt after flamethrower and taunt back when stacks are gone ez every time

[2:34:01] jaagob: ziqoAim
[2:34:07] thebookeu: not 5/6 andys until reset @Ziqoftw
[2:34:12] gangletronic: @Ziqoftw grounding totem eats the melee stack applications. shaman can reset his own stacks with it
[2:34:19] BlastBeatGo: yea idk done thos 1 tank on 4 chars 3 times
[2:34:25] BlastBeatGo: not sure
[2:34:31] VandettaOfficial: no way?!? totem resets fire stacks?
[2:34:35] BlastBeatGo: im a scuffed tank
[2:34:39] BlastBeatGo: ill be honest
[2:34:50] BlastBeatGo: cant say i dint goof a pull or 2
[2:34:53] shuyinko123: @Ziqoftw Il tank for u when get my shaman 40
[2:35:11] BlastBeatGo: ill take the hit
[2:35:12] gangletronic: -------- when he casts flamethrower. u drop grounding. by the time he picks boss up again grounding is off cooldown. u can eat 2 stakcs and your stacks will fall off
[2:35:19] gangletronic: just have to make sure grounding is in range when u kite
[2:35:26] Cecelia69: heyhey i cleared him 20 min ago the big change was as a feral i swapped to sunfire but i cleared every bomb with it Instant @ziqoftw
[2:35:30] BlastBeatGo: didnt even know it was your group figured alt code was fake ps
[2:35:33] BlastBeatGo: sorry boiz
[2:35:33] Xereseu: tanking is NOT hard...just run when breath is about to go off and have OT taunt AFTER breath ends only
[2:35:37] thebookeu: "i can tank him right now" proceeds to let it end 5/6 KEKW
[2:35:44] revognaH: did you turn in token for the chest ?
[2:36:01] ergobabyx: i'm so happy i didn't even start P2 of this garbanzo disappointment
[2:36:23] subbyye: full group of 99s and no finish?
[2:36:54] Stars69: i finally see pshero geared af at the start of a phase instead of at the end
[2:37:01] Zevioi: Its actually cheap now
