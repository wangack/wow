[4:06:54] WarmWetTight: worse than resto druid?
[4:06:55] Ssly: because i play holy pal
[4:07:00] AbyzzFails: i dont think so cause the priest was carry
[4:07:03] AbyzzFails: thats my opinion
[4:07:04] dicapz: no they’d be fine because priests can solo heal
[4:07:10] AbyzzFails: ^
[4:07:16] Wooshu: Paladin trash, Shamans better
[4:07:19] StarShopping95: You can literally kill anything with any spec
[4:07:41] gamelifedotcom: I believe they are better paired with a priest or such for extra buffs.  Right?
[4:07:48] StarShopping95: Like sure you can be more optimal but to say it's impossible is just not true
[4:07:54] AbyzzFails: yeah its not to the point its unplayable it would just make the raid potentially slightly harder

[6:05:41] JC0830: Sorry as usual 😂. Took off for a few team rounds of PUBG.
[6:05:41] AbyzzFails: Attack power bonus
[6:05:45] AbyzzFails: Might be why
[6:05:56] Dynamics831: grab the plate NODDERS
[6:05:58] AbyzzFails: The value in that is a lot
[6:06:00] d4ceric: why need to be better in pve
[6:06:05] d4ceric: pve is a joke can do it in greens
[6:06:14] d4ceric: raid is complete
[6:06:31] the_bhagwan: stamina is better against the casters
[6:06:37] swizurp: no reason for leather set unless you’re trying to sweat parses
[6:06:43] Dynamics831: the crit is nice, but yeah you will be squishy especially for blood moon
[6:06:51] minigenki: im going plate 100%
[6:06:56] AbyzzFails: I think it's the strength for damage
[6:07:04] AbyzzFails: Strength is a main stat right
[6:07:14] AbyzzFails: For DPS
[6:07:27] asddyo: try and see what feels best
[6:07:29] JC0830: Gn Desi!
[6:07:32] Arlhachedhel: As a rogue, I can tell which warriors are wearing leather, and ones that wear plate
[6:07:34] Renfuryy: do you have anything with 200 armor on it?
[6:07:34] AbyzzFails: Pvp in leather and armour pot
[6:07:46] Kushiize: armor pot lol
[6:07:47] d4ceric: no pvp bis list cause its situational
[6:07:51] Dynamics831: can i see how the plate looks?
[6:07:52] Renfuryy: can you remove an item to see the %
[6:08:10] Renfuryy: like to figure out how much 200 armor really is
[6:08:11] AbyzzFails: I mean armour is relative to you being hit by another melee not spells
[6:08:11] Ogunistt: the dmg reduction
[6:08:13] Renfuryy: in damage reduction
[6:08:16] Ogunistt: on your total armor
[6:08:18] AbyzzFails: Since most pvp is full of spells
[6:08:22] Renfuryy: so its 38.5%, if you lose 200 armor what will it be
[6:08:32] Kushiize: why not just take pve bis so u can get more gear
[6:08:40] Renfuryy: remove the shoulders yes
[6:09:00] AbyzzFails: I feel like Ren would know
[6:09:02] Renfuryy: okay so its 38.5 -> 36.1 if you take the leather
[6:09:05] swizurp: plates cooler, ez deciding factor
[6:09:19] AbyzzFails: Not really that much hahahha
[6:09:22] Arriv003: @Renfuryy is there some sort of mage gold farming scheme going on? I've seen at least 10 mages tonight with completely random letters for names
[6:09:22] AbyzzFails: Such a small difference
[6:09:38] AbyzzFails: Do you want to hit harder or live slightly longer
[6:09:45] Renfuryy: leather will probably be fine, 2% and its only against physical dmg
[6:09:45] AbyzzFails: And I mean slightly
[6:09:52] theman10n: heyyy desi, evening
[6:09:58] BooBooKittie: @DesiHeat LISTEN To me please
[6:10:01] theman10n: get the leather desi! trust in yourself
[6:10:19] Renfuryy: the 2 set for the plate is also kinda bad
[6:10:21] Renfuryy: for pvp
[6:10:26] AbyzzFails: I agree with ren
[6:10:35] BooBooKittie: You always play with a pocket healer. get the one with the most DPS
[6:10:35] Renfuryy: 7 def ThatsEnough
[6:10:35] Arriv003: BIG NUMBERS!
[6:10:36] AbyzzFails: Crit is good set bonus
[6:10:48] Fossabot: this play was TOO GOOD! 😂 #shorts → youtube.com/shorts/Uv3gQ_nYnLw
[6:10:54] the_bhagwan: i think warriors are much better as glass cannoncs
[6:11:01] AbyzzFails: ^
[6:11:02] lukkathebonder: but you can totally charge with plate armor
[6:11:09] swizurp: 1% hit with plate makes it all worth
[6:11:37] Renfuryy: ahh the hit with the 3 set is kinda good though
[6:11:51] asist0ne: Get the plate and buy 10 stacks of rank 1 elixirs.
[6:12:02] neeeeeo: Hi sweet Dasi
[6:12:13] AbyzzFails: Are you going to get the set bonus from it ?
[6:12:17] AbyzzFails: Does your bis give this
[6:12:26] Dynamics831: take the leather kermitNODDERS
[6:12:27] M1shox_: plate legs give hit
[6:12:28] AbyzzFails: If so go plate
[6:12:32] shandrenas: 2 pce leather is better then 3pce plate unfort for dps @DesiHeat
[6:13:09] M1shox_: boots and chest leather legs plate
[6:13:23] Renfuryy: every bis list is saying leather
[6:13:26] Dynamics831: it matches the gloves
[6:13:46] Kushiize: no tabard lol
[6:13:51] BooBooKittie: GRATZ
[6:13:54] the_bhagwan: love the green
[6:13:56] AbyzzFails: Yeah I'm sure there is a valid reason all bis lists go leather , probably cause your damage would suck without
[6:14:33] Kushiize: they want it on the same lock out as bfd
[6:14:35] Scaleless1776: after many hours of farming I got the tabard of the scarlet crusade! never going back lol
[6:14:53] highonexd: cg's scale, that's huge
[6:14:56] siggysudzz: Catsit
[6:16:11] theman10n: yeah slap ‘em desi!!
[6:16:24] theman10n: squish em

[6:18:30] Arriv003: @Renfuryy yo, what is up with all the mages who have names like "slkdjf"?
[6:18:31] Fossabot: https://twitter.com/desifuego/status/1757267915727044709?s=20 😡
[6:18:49] Renfuryy: @Arriv003 probably bots aoe farming for gold
[6:19:10] Scaleless1776: it added more badassness
[6:19:25] Arriv003: Transmog was actually decent. It was the redesign of the rune system that ppl were mad about
[6:20:19] BooBooKittie: your classic what @DesiHeat ?
[6:20:19] the_bhagwan: classic andys ICANT
[6:20:19] xeezotf: c razy woman

[6:20:21] Scaleless1776: I can look cool instead of a clown because of transmog
[6:20:34] BooBooKittie: no
[6:20:44] Catbreezy: transmog ruined the look of gear sets
[6:20:56] Arriv003: didn't you have to have had the item at one time to be able to transmog it?
[6:21:09] Arriv003: @Catbreezy some of the gear sets looked like trash though
[6:21:37] DesiHeat: wideMonkeArrive

[6:22:12] the_bhagwan: if i speak i will be in trouble
[6:22:32] the_bhagwan: that tabard is so sick
[6:23:02] the_bhagwan: @Arriv003 yeah, in cata u can solo molten core tho
[6:23:07] Dynamics831: those legs look awful ICANT
[6:23:16] Pyroheet: keking
[6:23:18] bastianCx: I went NE Female with purple hair just to match with WSG tabard. Kinda 5Head if u ask me
[6:23:23] Scaleless1776: why does the alliance wsg tabard look so bad
[6:23:26] the_bhagwan: Also desi, mounts/titles kinda became the "gear looks" in cata/wotlk
[6:23:33] the_bhagwan: tbc the shift kinda started i think
[6:23:34] Arriv003: @the_bhagwan I was doing solo BRD runs at lv63 and it was a lot of fun actually
