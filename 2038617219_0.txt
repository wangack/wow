[0:03:04] realdreadx: thats mog goes stupid dummy
[0:03:15] Malte_L: HeyGuys
[0:03:42] Grimey_George: hunter
[0:03:49] Explicitiz: @whaazz idk what that random 10% evic nerf is into comparison to add trinket bonus to 15%
[0:03:50] Malte_L: dragon
[0:03:59] Grimey_George: shaman
[0:04:16] rmdxcz: @Whaazz is meeh still alive ?
[0:04:22] bpressure: Whazz the Armor Buff/Nerf does it help or hinder rogue?
[0:05:30] Malte_L: yday evis hit 300k on a war with d stance fully geared. died 80-0 on duel. that why LUL
[0:05:38] ptr2x: I don't have exp on higher rating just 2.4 on rogue but i feel like sub damage is ultra stoppable unless you have decent teammates.
[0:05:41] alezxander1: Sub/outlaw for this awc?
[0:05:42] hiueeee: what's the most op part of outlaw do u think?
[0:05:44] dankgamer97: Whaazzler howdy PETPET peepoHappy
[0:06:08] WagwanBombaClatBomba: 10% evis nerf probly not alot but u combine that with the hp buff. might be a outlaw angle
[0:06:09] Talenshiv: Nice story bro
[0:06:09] Malte_L: yea idk
[0:06:10] Eddymvp_: @Malte_L You cannot hit 300k evis
[0:06:11] Explicitiz: Never ever u have green cloth gear
[0:06:11] Eddymvp_: lol
[0:06:16] Malte_L: 100%
[0:06:18] dailyshuffle: yea outlaw is maybe better on higer rating, you can control the game better as a sub imo, but i am not a rogue player
[0:06:22] realdreadx: just saw venruki get hit for a 300k ferocious bite from a feral
[0:06:26] TypicalEgoist: @whaazz I agree. sub is literally can’t die if sub didnt want you too.
[0:06:29] no_way_: ive 3 full geared sub rogues and never hit 300k
[0:06:44] JesusTbyte: I love you Whaazz but every patch Blizz nerf Rogue I enjoy it too much, that class vs someone who knows how to play it is way too opressive
[0:06:51] Eddymvp_: @dreadworldx That's different feral is giga broken and they buffed it aswell
[0:07:05] Eddymvp_: They should nerf feral dmg and give more survivability
[0:07:12] WagwanBombaClatBomba: ive seen 360k bite
[0:07:13] Explicitiz: 300k is nothing compared to 600k chaosbolt

[0:07:31] Lydiayang: I agree the burst on sub isn't that scary as long as you know  how to counter it with cooldowns, the constant cc and resetting is much more annoying
[0:07:42] zzxzzyx: ofc, when ppl with no hands play it
[0:07:48] dankgamer97: @dreadworldx Feral broken? broken bad maybe KEKW
[0:08:10] dailyshuffle: ofc whaazz ppl are clueless on lower rating LUL
[0:08:34] pantsupics: reseting cds is such a bad design
[0:08:45] nocapctg: rogue also is the highest skill cap class in this game
[0:08:51] nocapctg: u can't be an idiot and play it
[0:08:55] Eddymvp_: Tbh nerfing evis just retarded, they should rather nerf maybe blades or duel or secret tech going for evis is retarded
[0:08:55] no_way_: i think shadow duel makes sub rogue to look op if arena opens, and you make a one shoot go and they dont even know what happend it looks op
[0:08:58] khrylx_: yea but ww doesnt have 25 stuns tho
[0:09:01] knadam13: @nocapctg play arcane mage

[0:10:51] zzxzzyx: it's a debuff
[0:10:54] zzxzzyx: like poly
[0:10:57] maybethistimepls: snky is rly good at feral
[0:10:58] no_way_: its just bcause you need to know how to counter a sub if hes good. if you just use your skill randomw you die instantly. and that looks kinda more op then dying after 2 min agains an affliction lock...but i mean thats how sub rogue works. Kill in a 5 sec go
[0:11:02] bmanflex: its like ua
[0:11:15] Frostqttv: that shit is so troll i swear

[3:04:05] dankers7: @NoDSky game is close to being good*, they need to nerf the broken shit and they just refuse to do that, instead theyre buffing warlocks and mages for some reason lmao
[3:04:05] RonWilson: demo and outlaw should be unplayable cause they make the game unplayable for everyone else

[3:04:58] NoDSky: @RonWilson what u mean dude, alot of classes are boring, me my self I dont like chains of ice, I think it is obnoxious, also this grip 40 yards, but it is what it is.
[3:05:27] RonWilson: well yeah, I don't like a casting bm hunter that can stun me every 30 seconds for free, and coil me every 45 seconds while spamming fears
[3:05:29] Ameratzu: @Fakedtv dks and dhs will still hurt them bc their dmg is not completly physical
[3:05:36] RonWilson: also has a 20 second port with a freedom
[3:05:44] RonWilson: being tankier than most plate classes

[3:06:15] RonWilson: demo either needs to be nerfed into being a warlock again or to be nerfed to the ground
[3:06:17] Bruchteil: relax ronny
[3:06:20] scratchmyforhead: how are the rogue specs listed atm you think? so wich is best wich is worst
[3:06:33] NoDSky: warlocks aren't that tankier rn, if u do a proper stun go they flop, if u try to burst when they are free ofc they will port it is their only defensive
[3:06:38] WagwanBombaClatBomba: we got healthstones, now we win Kappa
[3:06:40] NoDSky: they will be very tanky on next reset
[3:06:48] WagwanBombaClatBomba: trenXD
[3:06:52] dankers7: @NoDSky they will be tuesday
[3:06:55] RonWilson: even if you stun demos they just dark pact or wall and live
[3:06:55] NoDSky: and I agree, they shouldnt, that is why I fear it becames too strong and gets to the ground
[3:07:04] RonWilson: and stun you
[3:07:05] RonWilson: KEKW
[3:07:12] dankers7: good, fuck warlocks
[3:07:27] RonWilson: literally have to cc the pet AND the lock to kill the lock

[3:07:28] NoDSky: u both gotta be bad melees
[3:07:47] dankers7: yeah im horrible 1400 player bro, show checkpvp
[3:07:48] NoDSky: to be complaining that much, slands was world of ret/war craft
[3:08:03] RonWilson: and demo was still aids to face
[3:08:06] NoDSky: and casters where there playing and not winning
[3:08:14] RonWilson: you're a bad wizard then
[3:08:15] NoDSky: only on s3
[3:08:18] NoDSky: 1 and 2
[3:08:20] NoDSky: it was dog
[3:08:25] NoDSky: had a one shot, that is it
[3:08:28] neiji37: Nobody played Demo in s1 hahah
[3:08:51] RonWilson: that's how it should be
[3:09:10] NoDSky: ladder on glad level is dominated by melee
[3:09:17] dankers7: who cares about glad
[3:09:29] neiji37: cant see any demolocks in top 50
[3:09:30] NoDSky: when u say ''warlock'' is eating me
[3:09:41] NoDSky: u might be thinking of CHAN who is a god, plays another game
[3:10:02] Antiquasar: who is patrick btw
[3:10:25] dankers7: @neiji37 idk about the other guy but im talking about after changes
[3:10:36] RonWilson: there's more warlock players queueing than most melee specs @NoDSky what are you on about lol
[3:10:38] Akiowns: is it the real lo0ny?
[3:10:48] Antiquasar: @Akiowns fuseton
[3:10:49] dankers7: especially if youre saying melees dominate the ladder lol
[3:11:05] NoDSky: at low level warlocks are op, at glad and above they fell a bit
[3:11:11] NoDSky: at top end, casters became good again
[3:11:11] Akiowns: fuseton resto shaman? @Antiquasar
[3:11:19] NoDSky: MOST of ppl play from 2100 to 2600
[3:11:23] Antiquasar: yup prettysure
[3:11:52] NobodyTouchesLegoat2: Rsham good into outlaw
[3:11:54] Rofyx: this warlock is look very troll would have won if he completed outland races
[3:12:01] RonWilson: @NoDSky you're literally wrong
[3:12:11] RonWilson: most players play at 1600-1900
[3:12:11] Moobot: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFHadK6prEPYQuCmR0tsug
[3:12:25] RonWilson: how are you getting 2100-2600? most players are glad?
[3:12:42] RonWilson: glad/duelist*
[3:12:42] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[3:12:45] RonWilson: makes no sense to me
[3:12:46] eacherro: Once the high PVP becomes only about DPS run to zero out the mana of the opponent healer, you know, the game is crap... The amount of cc everyone has is ridiculous
[3:12:52] scratchmyforhead: whats the best rogue spec at the moment???
[3:12:54] NoDSky: ok mb 2100 it too high, 1800-2600
[3:12:58] Antiquasar: @NoDSky theres more people 1600-1800 than total 1900+
[3:13:11] hongerlapp: @RonWilson @NoDSky most pvp players play random battlegrounds
[3:13:21] WagwanBombaClatBomba: mby focus dk and disarm him low
[3:13:25] WagwanBombaClatBomba: idk
[3:13:31] Barradoso: @hongerlapp most pvp players do M+
[3:13:31] dankers7: @hongerlapp most pvp players play league of legends KEKW
[3:13:36] RonWilson: LULW
[3:13:37] NoDSky: 1600 to 1800 I don't are pvpers, mb ppl that just get 1800 for Xmog
[3:13:40] hongerlapp: KEKW
[3:13:45] NoDSky: I don't think they are pvpers**
[3:13:52] RonWilson: that's a you issue
[3:13:59] hongerlapp: @dankers7 not fortnite?
[3:14:04] RonWilson: fact of the matter is that a small portion of the population even gets 2,1 and up
[3:14:09] RonWilson: and most people are way below that
[3:14:25] Bruchteil: who cares why so much malding ?
[3:14:35] NoDSky: I my self helped several friends to 1800 in 2s, they just PVE, but they want sets

[3:15:20] Antiquasar: thats a crazy statement
[3:15:29] RonWilson: I helped a lot of friends get their tabards this season, still doesn't change the fact that most players are under 1900
[3:15:32] NoDSky: where the game matters the most
[3:15:54] NoDSky: geting ur things, mounts, enchants blah blah
