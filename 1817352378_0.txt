[7:03:43] tatboy69: Which expansion is the most popular right now? Is retail beating wotlk and classic or its the other way around?
[7:04:18] thewetsprocket: retail
[7:04:20] UrsineTV: lots more hc
[7:04:26] Pallyofhell: the same ppl playing classic are playing retail
[7:04:33] Zanneth: between wotlk and the hardcore craze i think its keeping wow afloat
[7:04:36] Zanneth: also hai pally
[7:04:42] Pallyofhell: ello
[7:04:43] ezscaping: More content in retail rn. But classic brings more viewers
[7:04:44] latenightsuckmeright: way more play classic
[7:04:46] vanillasky7788: ofc Retail is way more full thatnclassic wotlk or normal one
[7:05:25] vanillasky7788: Retail is 3 times more populated than classic what ur guys talking about :D
[7:05:30] Pallyofhell: actually retail is bringing in more viewers with the world first going on right now
[7:06:46] Zanneth: i just cant get into it man, dragon flying was fun but the story... its just doesnt feel like wow anymore
[7:06:52] Drascho27: play chess
[7:07:16] tatboy69: how good is 1200 rating in chess?
[7:07:44] latenightsuckmeright: my favorite thing when a new patch comes out is lvl a brand new alt
[7:08:37] huntersolo: you didn't take his tower
[7:08:45] MyOpiate: HC chess?
[7:08:50] Macrel: why is boosting still a thing lol retail lvling easy xD

[7:10:27] SilkeySmooth: is boomkin form fat on the kultirian?
[7:10:29] Elwhappo: 1200‚Äì1400 Class D, category 4
[7:10:38] Pallyofhell: boosting is still a thing because classic andys still need to lvl and we know how lazy they can be
[7:10:42] gushydead: boosting is still big as some people don't have the time to level with work and stuff
[7:10:44] tatboy69: beat him with time LUL LUL

Shaman totems also only trigger a one second global cooldown as well as warlock curses with Amplify Curse .
