[0:38:51] Thoreya: @BlinkHeals its intentional, they didnt want to make them too complicated with the redone talent system
[0:39:00] Thoreya: which is understandable
[0:39:20] Gingerprimer: Yeah I think that choice is good even if some of them needs looking at

[0:44:32] Gingerprimer: Yeah and also they might think some specs already are good/interesting enough and do not need a super indepth set
[0:46:09] Gingerprimer: But also some them really needs 1 more look at them like Bear
[0:46:17] Molvonos: Tier sets are also generally boring at the beginning of an expansion.
[0:46:32] Molvonos: And get more interesting with each season. It's been like that forever.
[0:47:11] IamFlizzey: Hi guys, am i reading correct, that there ist M0 available ?
[0:47:17] Gingerprimer: Yes my issue is just that some classes have a good one but some are really bad/subpar IMO
[0:47:41] Jadesky1: It might be worth going back to compare the tier sets to historical ones. We’ve been getting borrowed power mechanics for so long yeah these seem boring.

[1:11:15] warrenny: The seasonal affix is just like storming right?
[1:11:18] Cezzan: Are m+ items upgradeable with valor in DF too? I havent checked on beta
[1:11:47] Aervyper: why shouldn't a mythic 18 give heroic raid look like for most people a mythic 18 dungeon is on the same scale as mythic raiding
[1:12:13] Thoreya: why do they feel the need to constantly push aside m+. accept the fact that some ppl prefer that to raiding LUL LUL

[1:15:51] Scoodles91: quacking on steroids
[1:15:52] Molvonos: MAN, I CANT WAIT FOR THUNDERING AND QUAKING
[1:15:57] Wcvechten: prideful
[1:15:58] mavericks312: it wouldnt be that bad if it also hit enemies
[1:16:01] Hypertitan: yay...another reason for me to yet again not do M+ haha
[1:16:01] Lazugo: prideful
[1:16:01] Blastmundr: Just gotta get that excess out of ya sometimes
[1:16:10] Fuzziew: Just makes melee stacking that much more cringe
[1:16:18] Wcvechten: I mean, if the things also work on enemies, it might be cool
[1:16:32] Gingerprimer: I think you also get a dps buff
[1:16:40] Menion01: Whelp, there went my plan to play melee
[1:16:43] Daarksyde: but it says "players"
[1:16:47] Molvonos: It specifies 'Allies'
[1:16:49] Wheeellz: the seasonal is supposed to have an upside too isnt it
[1:16:49] Funderik: i'm not willing to assume how it is, i want to see how it's played first.
[1:16:53] mavericks312: if it hits enemies its a cool affix
[1:16:54] Molvonos: Doesnt say anything about damaging enemies.
[1:17:05] cocus_the_red: imagine a mage blinking into a pack of mobs and stunning them it would be cool
[1:17:10] Robodope: it sounds like players gain stacks that blow up
[1:17:10] Wcvechten: It also says Excess energy, so maybe you can avoid it if you discharge all of its energy
[1:17:11] Cezzan: Sounds like quaking but it also stuns to me
[1:17:19] neverbornlucky: Towelliee which came first the dragon or the egg ?

[1:18:04] Gingerprimer: It also says excess energy maybe you can use the energy b4 it becomes to strong
[1:18:18] Funderik: i feel like there's stuff missing to it, it might be a kiss curse, like you are buffed while in storm and when it expires it stuns and hurts without w/e damage you didn't use

[1:18:52] Wcvechten: Probably best way is to see it in action, or have an actual explanation instead of a datamine
[1:19:13] mavericks312: we also dont know if this is how the affix is released at launch
[1:19:21] Hypertitan: give you like an extra action button or something??
[1:19:21] Lazugo: SOONtm
[1:19:21] Funderik: looks like classic wowhead clickbait half datamined info, it's gotta be a kiss curse.
[1:19:31] TotallyNotRaien: truly quaking 2: Electric boogaloo
[1:19:34] nimshot: Sounds like it'll spawn some zones on the ground that you can either avoid or "pick up" to empower yourself but if you have leftover when it ends, you get fucked
[1:19:36] Daarksyde: Quaking+
[1:19:44] warrenny: Quaking was overhated
[1:19:49] Zilberg: LUL Rip Melee

[1:20:51] neverbornlucky: you mean most people online aren't like me ?
[1:20:55] Korupcija_: I'm so sad spiteful is still in the game

[1:30:25] NerdyTeK: i put my feral in the emerald dream ... he aint never waking up
[1:30:26] TotallyNotRaien: feral was doing amazing damage
[1:30:27] MrsPyra: Feral hasnt been good since Legion, they took away artifacts and it became trash.
[1:30:27] dimofodi: Probably be more Feral if they weren't just a worse version of Balance?
[1:30:32] MisterBongwater: I mean how many spear hunters were there before s3
[1:30:40] Rottencoarse: https://twitter.com/Psybear_tv/status/1577938281748209666 @Towelliee  Psy's take on the feral changes
[1:30:40] MrsPyra: I played a feral in Legion and we were beast
[1:30:42] Robodope: they gave them the coolest mage tower skin and called it a day
[1:30:44] Hopsandgrain: Used to main feral back in the day but just went to Bear last few expacs.  sadge
[1:30:49] trevomancho: @Towelliee hoq ia ret pala and arms warrior as dps atm?
[1:31:03] NerdyTeK: legion bear/feral was fun af
[1:31:27] MrsPyra: @Robodope Thats when they was good too. They do have the best mage tower skins
[1:31:32] Robodope: they were trashing every other healer on most raid testing logs i saw
[1:31:35] Daarksyde: with all the passives, resto druids could shine
[1:31:43] Hardernerd: @Towelliee no guardian Sadge
[1:31:44] MisterBongwater: Rdruids don’t seem meta but pretty strong
[1:32:28] warrenny: Damage coefficients?
[1:33:21] Molvonos: Nah, you right
[1:33:22] GamingDad77: no you right
[1:33:28] MrsPyra: you're right
[1:33:29] miketrouts: down bad
[1:33:30] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  teleport is for yourself portal is for the group
[1:33:35] Instantpancakes: probably have to learn it from a portal trainer first, but yes
[1:33:37] thasthebear: feelsbadman
[1:33:39] luckfore: laser bear
[1:33:48] poleon17: aren't portals learned at the portal trainer at that city though usually
[1:33:54] TotallyNotRaien: this might be copium but the total radio silence points to redesign, why bother with tuning if youre gonna change it all
[1:33:55] raldrik: still have to get to the portal trainer, I think they made it 62 for alts that dont need to do the story
[1:33:56] Sarocus: it is usually like that, though. We get teleport early on
[1:33:57] Barret: that and the base druid class tree
[1:34:02] sliproach: We got one whole change week 3 of testing
[1:34:02] mavericks312: cause were the main character
[1:34:02] kiljoy102: @Towelliee have mages ever gotten a pass?: I dont remember any mage changes in these builds
[1:34:05] reggiepowa: isn't it similar for most classes, 1 build with some utility options?
[1:34:07] Sarocus: Don't question mages!
[1:34:12] Lostdogal: doesn't make much sense as you have to train it at the city
[1:34:14] TheZander: you have to be in valdrakken to learn it
[1:34:16] kjdocs: you have to get to valdrakken, before you can learn the spell
[1:34:22] Gragnar: its trained IN valdraken, so you need to go there yourself first
[1:34:29] luke238: you need to go to the portal trainer to get the portal in the first place
[1:34:34] MrsPyra: they just cant port you there , dosent mean you cant go
[1:34:44] mavericks312: there really trying to make arcane a thing with this xpac
[1:34:48] Lostdogal: unless they add it to any portal trainer
[1:34:51] ralecgos: Mages have to travel to the city and train the teleport and portal at the trainer at the city. So they don’t technically get to teleport there low level for free
[1:35:10] BMagicTX: @mavericks312  you are not a fan of arcane? i feel like it would be nice to have it
[1:35:13] ltrkar: ackshully
[1:35:17] kowaikokoro: BatChest year of the crane
[1:35:30] Robodope: rsk mana increase is probably the only thing of concern
[1:35:40] MisterBongwater: Punchy healey
[1:37:33] morgaino: Shadow in shambles
[1:37:43] Daarksyde: holy crap
[1:38:00] kiljoy102: @Towelliee shadow discord is pretty doomer
[1:38:04] mavericks312: @BMagicTX its not that im not a fan i just dont think they can recapture that wrath/cata arcane spec
[1:38:10] raldrik: on Max's stream last night they said this is so much ass and has no AOE

[1:43:03] andrejhmm: True. PVE is EZ. People need to get out of the min-max way of thinking. PVP on the other hand can have F tier specs.

[2:08:17] LifeJackett: As a casual player id really love to be able to queue for single bosses. Happy to keep it linear (cant queue for boss 3 until killed 2) but 1-2 hours play time per day, cant committ to a raid schedule makes it really difficult to clear an entire raid and also committ to a full clear
[2:08:17] Feilprodusert: you leveled all these to 70 ? :O
[2:08:24] Brodih_: Tyrhold realm name... I read it as Tryhard

[2:51:15] Megadisaster24: I knew there was going to be a hook somewhere

[2:51:26] Aquadriel: KEKWlaugh
[2:51:30] b1z49: so i only can play 3 days a week, i can do that in 2 years i think

[2:52:01] Sarocus: You get 3k rep from the weekly, right?
[2:52:01] Aquadriel: is it because is account wide? theres no other fucking reason for this garbage.
[2:52:03] Tehsunman: Fun detected
[2:52:07] TotallyNotRaien: how did they even come to the conclusion that it was a good change
[2:52:09] andrejhmm: That is my reaction to making PVP sets Class-specific instead of Armor Type specific.
[2:52:12] Megadisaster24: They better make that Alt Wide,
[2:52:14] luckfore: yikes fur ever
[2:52:16] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  you jinxed it sir :(
[2:52:23] Dinermoe: yo @Scarizard, hit the revert button KEKW
[2:52:23] Mozzeyy_: @towelliee how hard is it to get into tanking in retail? Been loving tanking in classic
[2:52:28] Purgatan: I like the battlepass vibe from the renown...looks cool...my only problem is sticking with one class for long enough to get it done...
[2:52:32] jaygutta504: maybe they have tabards
[2:52:36] Reckless_Monk: But.... we do.
[2:52:46] foxyvexx: what level do evokers start ?
[2:52:47] DavidBrutal123: are renows same as today ?
[2:52:47] hutzika: Why does it need to be a cap even tho
[2:52:53] soysos91: It'd be relative to how much rep you're rewarded
[2:52:55] Dreadfrost: just play human i guess? :))
[2:52:57] Jadesky1: That’s their answer to having more casual content lol
[2:53:01] Vowyrin: did you do BDK yet?

[2:53:15] NalinA: Veng DH
[2:53:15] harpdarp: how r palas broken?
[2:53:16] soysos91: If rep rewnown is increased and rep gain is increased it'd be relatively the same
[2:53:22] baleszt: how's prot rage gain after the nerfs?
[2:53:37] Dinermoe: i didnt feel a single mythic mechanic lol
[2:53:44] jaygutta504: is warrior still best tank
[2:53:59] barefoot_on_bricks: but renown is account wide isn't it?
[2:54:20] Mitune: mostly account wide
[2:54:24] bypized: @Towelliee are you going back to ELVUI when it launches?
[2:54:30] DasNeids: What are people using for party frames in beta? I have yet to find an addon that works =(
[2:54:42] KingSpud91: so warrior still op even after nerfs?
[2:54:51] baleszt: I just hope we don't get the SL treatment where our rage gain is shit outside of cooldowns.
[2:54:55] Sertrunku: @barefoot_on_bricks is the renown or the rewards that are account wide?
[2:55:20] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Mozzeyy_ (warning)
[2:55:23] barefoot_on_bricks: not sure @Sertrunku hence me asking lol
[2:55:25] NalinA: did they nerf arms rage gen too?
[2:55:31] Dinermoe: @NalinA yes
[2:55:35] jaygutta504: are they still the best tank
[2:55:39] NalinA: Sadge
[2:55:40] billybaroo1: Think Indy can beat Denver w/o Taylor?
[2:55:51] Sertrunku: @barefoot_on_bricks had the ideia that only the rewards are account wide, not the progess
[2:56:39] s7wede: @Towelliee While I agree that the increased renown cap is too high, I have no problem with a slightly higher cap than the original 1000 rep required per level. This is supposed to last at least the entirety of season 1 if I'm not mistaken
[2:56:59] barefoot_on_bricks: @Sertrunku ah okies.
[2:57:25] Proto_Paradigm: Anyone elses Retail WoW updating right now?

[2:58:32] TheeLazyDuck: omg they broke grand crusader
[2:58:39] morp1onz: How do you have your dragon riding action bar on your 3rd bar ?
[2:58:46] Scojan: None of it KEKW
[2:58:53] s7wede: It's all supposed to be account wide if I'm not mistaken
[2:59:05] Demanisraar: I did notice the Dragon flying glyphs where account wide, that is huuuuuge
[2:59:05] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[2:59:16] TotallyNotRaien: its account wide
[2:59:16] thebestwarlockk: if they moved the activities to be up in front maybe you can earn more rep from those ? so the nerf to rep might be to compensate for that ?
[2:59:17] Roaringkittylol: Its the same problem as retail if thats the case
[2:59:18] treenation4: @Towelliee if this stuff isn't account wide i really dont think ill play
[2:59:21] zhonkss: that sounds like what they would do
[2:59:21] b1z49: this is blizzard
[2:59:28] iforceftw: renown is not account wide?
[2:59:30] Alienfromger: you never know KEKW
[2:59:36] Scojan: I would be amazed if it was account wide
[2:59:39] EKS90_: unlocks shojld be not levels
[2:59:40] TotallyNotRaien: oh true, blizzard isnt a trusted source
[2:59:43] treenation4: lost ark has taught me how much fun account wide progression is. It respects your time much more
[2:59:46] EKS90_: as i heard it
[2:59:47] Demanisraar: My alts are rip then lol
[2:59:49] LilDeanix: They keep it a surprise until release kek
[2:59:54] b1z49: main 1 char or get fuk nerds haha
[2:59:55] GamingDad77: So far Mr.GM has found it to be account wide.
[2:59:56] bypized: Blizzard excuse will be that they want to keep the player engaged and have something to do every time they login to the game LUL @Towelliee
[2:59:56] UpSlash: my bet is NOT account wide. they want a big grind
[2:59:58] CasualFeel: blizzard has a hateboner against alts
[3:00:07] DasNeids: @Towelliee What party frames are you using for beta? Having a heck of a time finding one that works in Beta.
[3:00:13] nazvar: hate is a big word, but i do fkn hate them for not making it acc wide, thats just dumb af
[3:00:22] thebestwarlockk: didnt they say everything apart from player power in renown is account wide ?
[3:00:35] Demanisraar: quack-equack KEKW
[3:00:44] TheeLazyDuck: ayo towelliee did you play paladin today? grand crusader is broken instead of 20% chance it is 100%
[3:01:15] thebestwarlockk: ive heard/read that only the gear that you get from renown is not account wide, but everything else is
[3:01:27] EKS90_: they did say activities and stuff should be account wide. hopefully they stick to that.
[3:01:37] Animemron: BM monk! Lets gooo!
[3:01:50] Demanisraar: Pog

[3:03:26] Gingerprimer: Does the UI have an export function?
[3:03:27] thebestwarlockk: do you think that moving the renown activities more upfront is to compensate for the rep nerf
[3:03:34] soysos91: boom boom towelie
[3:03:53] Demanisraar: I like it
[3:03:53] DevilSpire: @Towelliee i really hope renown rep grinds will be account wide...

[3:26:16] textio545: but its 6th war in world so mby its answer hmm XD
[3:26:28] Tanker01: I'm really worried that they havent yet fixed the tank dmg or the dmg of all classes... tank do wayyy to much currently and some classes too. so they cannot really compare the difficulty of these dungeons :/
[3:26:39] dhrakari66: guys numbers arent tuned yet how are u comparing stuff
[3:26:57] ElDrakenMan: when is prepatch?
[3:27:02] Sutekiii: wait what is this? they remastered uldaman?

[3:29:36] ElDrakenMan: im not ready
[3:29:39] sperg0verlord: why are they dropping dragonlfight so close to WOTLK release ?
[3:29:43] llNoTToXiCll: @Towelliee  you can always ask ion

[3:36:16] ZealotryTV: they should make brez ret only
[3:36:28] ZealotryTV: prot has spell bop and holy has AM ret has nothing
[3:36:39] ArcaneMaki: I miss Mark of Ursoc that Guardian druid had :(
[3:36:48] Mecabeast: what if it was mad ea raid cd like brez?
[3:36:54] UltraContent: @Commander_Eggi  ok make sense but atleast can they do a blue post to announce the date of ends of season? that should be done atleast 1 month before the end
[3:37:03] HonestPhilosophy: Does evoker not use mana I havent seen the bar move?
[3:37:21] Almex: they do :)
[3:37:40] Daarksyde: Ret has huge holy power generation and can off heal like classic
[3:37:42] textio545: giving milion gold before live relese ret was be trash again XD
[3:37:51] Daarksyde: or pew pew
[3:37:55] Getitonthelow: So what’s meta dps looking like in the new xpac so far?
[3:38:00] soth_klf: we all know Ret is going to get the nerf hammer pretty soon anyway...
[3:38:11] UltraContent: @Commander_Eggi  like the end of the season is in 3 weeks and they won't announce it? come on is weird
[3:38:19] luckfore: wtf ToS gear is ilvl 159 LUL

[3:39:19] TheBroCrow: Towellie said feral and ret are meta, rerolling now
[3:39:23] EKS90_: @UltraContent I think they usually announce that 2-3 weeks before, and since prepatch is not 100% on the 25th of october, its around end of october/beginning of november, so we will hear more in roughly 1 week I believe.
[3:39:31] deathcrier: ret is the best clip it and ship it
[3:39:42] thisismysuit: its a broken talent in ret tree
[3:39:45] Daarksyde: look at this Ret dmg for single target... like wtf
[3:39:48] Korupcija_: so is this dungeon for pre patch?
[3:39:50] ZealotryTV: they havent even begun tuning ret really and everyone is like ret damage is so good KEKW
[3:39:56] ArcaneMaki: towNut3
[3:40:00] EKS90_: @pauvreconlol then why are u here?

[3:40:15] TheeLazyDuck: evoker tank is meta
[3:40:20] TheZander: ah yes the massive fury dps, you love to see it
[3:40:38] Getitonthelow: Let me guess ret is broken right now, and we’ll get nerfed right?
[3:40:40] remuladen_hitta_spaden: any dungeon? Pog
[3:40:44] alteration1545: keys work in any dungeon now? luxthoPog
[3:40:46] Kinetsu: @Towelliee Have you tried End of Dragons on guild wars 2?

[3:41:30] Sanctana827: thanks for the group @Towelliee
[3:41:31] textio545: ok but ret is now u see just divine storm but u didint see he need to track holy buff to up his divine storm dmg
[3:41:36] its____rooster: @Towelliee   looking at the buffs and nerfs to the classes where do you/chat feel prot warrior stands?
[3:41:39] alteration1545: @Getitonthelow if you're lucky, might just take ret out back..
[3:41:43] TheeLazyDuck: do you think they will enable m+ before next build or is it gonna be a build type deal
[3:41:59] Getitonthelow: I figured
[3:42:00] getflnked: @rdnkRooster s tier
[3:42:03] ZeroNpcTV: is this beta?
[3:42:10] 91Niki: Imagine having so much free time, that you follow a streamer just to shit on the game he plays @pauvreconlol . Couldn't be me. have a nice day towHi
[3:42:11] Yoinkioinki: Also no tuning pass boys and girls no point asking meta and stuff. Also meta is relative to your level of content. Don't worry you got this!
[3:42:20] TheeLazyDuck: @zeronpctv wrath classic
[3:42:27] Almex: You going for more? =) would like to test out envoker (if i can login to it now^^).. (was the boomie in this run)..
[3:42:29] ZeroNpcTV: @zeronpctv Nice
[3:42:36] EKS90_: @UltraContent Like you have to think of everything, its not only pvp that is having a short season, we have had 6 weeks of raiding and m+ so if a normal season is 5-6 months, and this being little over 2½ something? that kinda tracks with them saying " short season " as a new test feature.
[3:43:26] Getitonthelow: @towelliee so what’s your take on the new xpac so far compared to the others?
[3:43:39] szble: xqcDespair new world
[3:43:53] Prevention6: end of dragons was kinda meh compared to the first 2 GW2 expansions you didn't miss much imo
[3:43:57] EKS90_: I started playing gw2 again like 1 month ago, finally unlocked the griffon, gonna get into end of dragons later on ^^ taking my time doing stuff in order and just relaxing. its a good chill game.
[3:44:04] UltraContent: lol
[3:44:05] Brickneim: xroads

[3:44:59] Fawcheddar: friend D A inc

[3:45:13] EKS90_: @mavericks312 kept a steady 20k players this year, now up to over 40k
[3:45:13] Rottencoarse: ty for the party @Towelliee

[3:45:42] mavericks312: @Commander_Eggi oh nice
[3:45:44] AssaultF4: i love disc but hate them in m+
[3:46:02] dimofodi: how has paladin felt?
[3:46:05] EKS90_: @mavericks312 yeah new free expansion with fresh servers coming now in october.
[3:46:08] Dreadfrost: did you do dk allready?
[3:46:13] Dreadfrost: @Towelliee
[3:46:27] SimplyRed: LUL
[3:46:34] zeiours: @towelliee Are you going to be leveling a warrior tank in df?
[3:46:36] GamingDad77: It's "gloria" us
[3:46:43] EKS90_: @UltraContent if the leaks are correct prepatch will be 5 weeks similar to legion being 4 weeks, and having the "event" be 2 weeks roughly, so people can get used to talents, UI, level their evoker. etc etc
[3:46:53] Gingerprimer: @jooooker he levels all the tanks
[3:46:55] llNoTToXiCll: @Towelliee  sometimes i would get mad at other warrior tanks that couldnt keep  ignore pain buff up
[3:47:04] Dagomarus: But thats why i like tanks like brewmaster and blood dk, like if your not good at the rotation and timings your really bad, but if your good your pretty much unkillable
[3:47:11] llNoTToXiCll: its one of warriors best moves
[3:47:39] dhrakari66: do u have an enhacner too ?
[3:48:04] Khlaro: Open Beta yet or is it still invite only?
[3:48:05] Highparkk_: @Dagomarus blood dks have a rotation aside from death strike?
[3:48:15] 91Niki: @Khlaro_ There is never open beta for wow
[3:49:02] Dagomarus: @highparkk_ the ds is more about timing it, cant just spam it plus if you want good damage you need to rune manage
[3:49:03] Shamwise: towHAMUP towHAMUP Wuddup Towelliee
[3:49:37] 91Niki: Dreanor cohhM
[3:49:43] 91Niki: towSweat
[3:49:47] Khlaro: Oh yeah? Didn't Wod eventually give everyone beta? Only 2 betas I've been in was WoD and BFA. Guess somethings don't change for Blizzard
[3:50:07] Kuzzo99: the starter builds are so trash lol boomies starter build doesn't make you take Solar beam lool
[3:50:11] 91Niki: @Khlaro_ It's always flagged accounts / invites or beta keys
[3:50:14] ElDrakenMan: fresh start servers for new world Nov 2nd! woo
[3:50:29] Khlaro: Interesting.

[3:50:58] EKS90_: @drakenPWN yupp just came on twitter.
[3:51:06] 91Niki: @Khlaro_ The servers aren't meant for open betas. They are meant to test the content. Not the stability ;) Open beta would just overflow the servers and crash them.
[3:51:12] Baaltaza: Nice, thx guys
[3:51:17] TotallyNotRaien: RnT is the only choice there
[3:51:21] qinlae: R&T for moonfire damage

[3:53:34] Mecabeast: people also need to keep in mind what new people will see when playing for the first time they will have to level to get unlocks too
[3:53:43] llNoTToXiCll: @Kelticlore  if you want to try the talents of rogue or have a rogue main you can copy it to ptr and test talents atleast
[3:53:45] LSBreed: There has always been more than 1 build. leveling, raid, dungeon.
[3:53:54] Kelticlore: will wrath be the last classic
[3:53:56] flebbooo: PogChamp

[3:57:05] llNoTToXiCll: @Hardernerd  whoa thats really sick i didnt know this thanks for sharing
[3:57:54] raldrik: pew pew bear FTW
[3:58:01] Rohen86: Virgin Moonfire vs Chad Maul
[3:58:09] Dagomarus: Moonfire is definately a better m+ build
[3:58:30] ExanimisGG: i love maul....trolls in feral KEKW
[3:58:41] Rohen86: I bet if they made Maul hit 2 extra targets we could convert some minds
[3:58:45] sliproach: @Rohen86 you can take both if you skip defensive talents
[3:58:55] Dagomarus: I thought all w point needs were getting yeeted
[3:59:04] llNoTToXiCll: what is exactly wrong with maul
[3:59:17] TotallyNotRaien: @NoTToXiCLuL rn nothing, theyre just dumb
[3:59:17] Moobot: Details for DF Beta https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files/3974119
[3:59:18] Rohen86: @NoTToXiCLuL Maul ir perfect
[3:59:20] Rohen86: Maul is perfis*
[3:59:22] Gragnar: haven't seen many 3 points talents, surprised there still are any left...
[3:59:26] Kelticlore: towllie what if the rogues legendary daggers got upgraded to dragonflight status
[3:59:43] EKS90_: @Towelliee new world is kinda bad at using their own hype, people wanted fresh ,they announce fresh to launch november 2nd, inside a wow prepatch window and 2 weeks after expansion hype for NW
[3:59:50] thebakeriscomingforu: guardians also don't shift much
[3:59:51] DisparagingTurtle: id drop those two points tbh that sounds like a pvp talent
[3:59:53] Rohen86: I do believe there should be no 3 point nodes
[4:00:03] llNoTToXiCll: but its what bears do is maul stuff x D
[4:00:10] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee Will DF have like a Legendary system like they did with Shadowlands?
[4:00:12] sliproach: yes
[4:00:42] EKS90_: @NewWorldReign no
[4:00:56] Animemron: @NewWorldReign Nope, no leggos so far at least
[4:01:06] Rohen86: The 2 piece should just make Maul cleave
[4:01:14] sliproach: only convoke
[4:01:24] llNoTToXiCll: bookmkin tank
[4:01:25] ElmSpace: would you  still need the rejuv and swiftmend then since you took it to get to the damage and healing node?
[4:01:28] llNoTToXiCll: boomkin*
[4:01:59] casualconsumer_: boomking
[4:02:06] EKS90_: @Towelliee new world is kinda bad at using their own hype, people wanted fresh ,they announce fresh to launch november 2nd, inside a wow prepatch window and 2 weeks after expansion hype, seems like a very bad move
[4:02:08] sliproach: convoke & gtfo of chicken form b4 someone sees you @Towelliee
[4:02:08] Kelticlore: what if druids got symbiosis as a talent option
[4:02:17] rxdderz_: which tanks look strong for dungeons? been out the loop

[4:02:51] thisismysuit: what addons are u using?
[4:03:12] EKS90_: Brimstone sand launches 18th october, and fresh servers is november 2nd, I feel its a bit "late" but I guess we will see how it works out @Towelliee
[4:03:15] Quackthyr: Hey Towelliee, 10+ year prot pally here. How do you feel about dusk of dawn prot build. Dungeons are feeling very good for me at least atm
[4:03:34] Short_Film: New World classic?
[4:03:47] EKS90_: 18th yes.
[4:03:52] Holysal: This will go badly for the fresh servers if they do that. All the ppl that wasnt going to run fresh will now go there and mess up the fresh servers. Theres companies already making them plans
[4:03:52] shadez1: hehe
[4:04:06] shadez1: that smart
[4:04:14] AllenzoTV: ya thats fair
[4:04:18] Holysal: its bad
[4:04:27] EKS90_: @Towelliee I 100% get that, i thought the same, but I just feel they are missing the initial launch hype, guess I can see both aspects?
[4:04:28] shadez1: history of new world is mostly game braking buggs
[4:04:52] N3llee: there will be degen shit for sure
[4:04:58] rxdderz_: which tanks look strong for dungeons? been out the loop
[4:05:09] Daganatv: Ive never played NW should i wait for the new update?
[4:05:23] shadez1: @Towelliee queston have they done anything to group farming chest at end game ? yet
[4:05:37] N3llee: do we have a start date for fresh?
[4:05:59] shadez1: ye weit for frash server 100% :D
[4:06:06] EKS90_: @N3llee november 2nd,
[4:06:07] volkreig: @Towelliee 10.0 prepatch splashscreen is out, wouldnt be surprised if we got an announcement today
[4:06:11] aogaming23: How is BM Monk ? I think I just missed it :(
[4:06:15] UltraKSlaya: check it out on the PTR
[4:06:29] UltraKSlaya: wait for fresh
[4:06:29] NiteshadezTV: thats what im doing lmao. just waiting
[4:06:34] shadez1: i havent played thame sense all bug happend so
[4:06:36] kickash72: That is what I am doing, just waiting
[4:06:38] Steel_Saint_x: the reason i dont want to start over is woodcutting
[4:06:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: too much going on in everything else to pick up another mmo
[4:06:43] N3llee: Nov 2nd the date
[4:06:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: imo
[4:06:53] N3llee: wtf they want to go up against wrath and df
[4:06:55] EKS90_: @Towelliee my biggest "worry" for fresh, is they making like. 3 servers, and underprepparing so we get massive Qs and locked servers again LUL
[4:07:18] UltraKSlaya: the minute I got my phone working for overwatch they take SMS away lol
[4:07:23] Kelticlore: @towelliee what if druids got the mop talent symbiosis as dragonflight talent?
[4:07:31] ScouseDonkey: Loading a profile loads all the keybinds for me
[4:07:39] captiv8: you know you can make your player frame huge now right?
[4:07:39] Holysal: Yeah but everyone will be done with Brimstone on their 60 and now run Fresh when they wont of. Fresh after the release is going to be a bad. Another AGS fail imo
[4:07:44] ruhroraggy: I've been in and out of New world and would love to go fresh but with DF and pre patch I won't get into it
[4:08:09] stabzmcgeee: are your keybinds the same across all toons? if so just turn off char specific
[4:08:30] ElmSpace: No transfers in would be the point of fresh servers.  Also finally would clear all the effects of duping and economy bug exploits used at the beginning of new world which is nice.
[4:08:43] Gingerprimer: Symbios was so broken and would be a nightmare to balance ngl
[4:08:48] EKS90_: @Towelliee my biggest "worry" for fresh, is they making like. 3 servers, and underprepparing so we get massive Qs and locked servers again LUL so I hope they are not doing that.
[4:08:56] ElDrakenMan: everyone wanted them to launch with or before  brimestone not after
[4:09:33] Dagomarus: I wonder if it will see alot of people come back, because new world is a very niche mmo

[5:33:43] Bennodkk: if i was that dk i would switch to frost after the huge nerf to unholy they arent worth playing sadly
[5:34:28] Reckless_Monk: Its wasnt YUGE.. but yes Frost is the spec to go for now

[5:35:34] Nathanonfire: It wasn’t that big
[5:35:36] Reckless_Monk: got to be more mindful of what youre doing as Unholy.. Frost is mindless right now with its buff
[5:36:05] Bennodkk: envokers got buffed i see
[5:36:32] GamingDad77: @Bennodkk this guy just figured out his spec and what works.
[5:36:38] Nathanonfire: @bennodkk you don’t need to be meta to get invited to high keys you need big IO
[5:36:41] Reckless_Monk: Deathcoil nerf just made it so Epidemic is viable again
[5:37:14] smegarol: @Towelliee Warrior sucks? Or does it have potential?
[5:37:18] propwash80: @Towelliee how does the bear tank feels so far?
[5:37:27] Reckless_Monk: Cleave damage of Coil just made you use it over Epi
[5:37:40] propwash80: @smegarol apparently is really good still
[5:38:01] Rodorann: lol
[5:38:27] orionnhawk: you like the new UI? Or will you still stick with EluVI?
[5:38:34] smegarol: Well then. If so
[5:38:35] TheBroCrow: @Towelliee paladin tank any good? Kappa
[5:38:37] gr_faux: Blood or vengeance which do you think will be better for m+
[5:38:39] darkkilla1: public beta when
[5:38:45] 1llum1n471: Did he just say that warrior tank is the best tank rn?
[5:38:52] Featherbow: @darkkilla1 never
[5:38:57] propwash80: @Towelliee so is the druid tank as bad as ppl claim it to be?
[5:39:18] pereadin: All about the return of the glorious holy Paladin damage. I haven’t had this much fun playing h pal since legion.
[5:39:28] ogdemonix: has demo warlock been changed again for the new expansion launch?
[5:39:54] pereadin: @ogdemonix as far as I saw no. Still imp spawning hard.
[5:40:10] shlumpgg: prot paladins any good
[5:40:11] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:40:11] darkkilla1: does the new talent trees actually make a difference or is everyone just going to be running the same builds
[5:40:14] smegarol: @Towelliee Well listen. So many times you tried to show something as a warrior. The end result was disappointment.
[5:40:21] thebakeriscomingforu: The druid class tree needs some refinement, guardian tree could use a little to.
[5:40:51] pereadin: @darkkilla1 it’ll depend a lot on the class. There 2+ viable builds for practically every spec.
[5:41:00] GamingDad77: @darkkilla1 it does. but 90% of people will just use the meta
[5:41:01] Rudric_Ice: hows dracthyr dps now better ?

[5:41:56] D_Addi: Warrior is crazy good, prot took 2 rounds of nerfs so far and its still cracked
[5:42:16] kone_malone: @Towelliee how can I get addons (details) to work in beta? I get obliterated with LUAs
[5:42:42] Featherbow: @Squalls00 make sure it's updated
[5:42:46] pereadin: I’m just glad they fixed H Pal damage. I’ve been averaging 14-25k overall damage per dungeon.
[5:43:06] chrslp: @Squalls00 https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files Theres a DF version
[5:43:42] pereadin: Glimmer damage increase
[5:43:45] pereadin: By a lot too
[5:43:47] shlumpgg: is it worth playing prot pally this expac
[5:44:09] pereadin: @capitalist_man162 yes
[5:44:10] Rudric_Ice: rets ? still in shambles ?
[5:44:24] 1llum1n471: Prot Pally is fine, just not anything flashy like the other tanks. Pally is business as usual
[5:44:26] pereadin: @rudric_ice ret is probably one of the more busted specs right now
[5:44:28] shlumpgg: rip
[5:44:41] Keyastaron_: people are speculating Crit mastery for Evokers  im at 47 % mastery on beta LUL

[5:44:43] Thoreya: ret is fuckin busted in beta
[5:44:53] ogdemonix: im still not convinced with these talent trees they will end of being cookie cutter builds as always
[5:45:02] chrslp: Well after 3 days I'm only 245 mining FeelsBadMan Regretting neglecting it since Classic
[5:45:06] llNoTToXiCll: @capitalist_man162  honestly you would have to determine that also by playing
[5:45:11] Rudric_Ice: damn ret being busted holy what is this wrath ? Kappa
[5:45:27] Vyntage1: @ogdemonix  of course they wont. There will always be a meta.
[5:45:39] probablydaz: Is this mythic finally?
[5:45:45] Keyastaron_: they should redo the evoker mastery.. higher the damage the more dps they do that shouldnt be like that,
[5:45:46] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Oh, so they're an Afflock in Classic?
[5:46:03] shlumpgg: yea thats fair
[5:46:08] 1llum1n471: Is Ret rotation still the same? "See yellow button not on CD, hit yellow button?
[5:46:39] pereadin: I had to take a long break from WoW due to irl stuff. Saw I had beta and decided to give it a shot now that I had time again. Immediately fell in love with the flow of the shockadin build I made.
[5:46:51] pereadin: Have super high hopes for DF now.
[5:46:53] Dudutoolbox: i miss old consacration animation
[5:46:56] coversRbetter: if a ret has a tank like you consecration wont do any damage LUL
