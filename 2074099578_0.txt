Part of you will always lie upon black glass sand beside a lake of fire while flames chew at your flesh.  You can hear yourself breathing. It comes hard, and harsh, and it scrapes nerves already raw, but you cannot stop it. You can never stop it. You cannot even slow it down. You don’t even have lungs anymore.
