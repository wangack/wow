[2:12:46] KingSlayerYotam: how much of it will be worth to do IonJam
[2:12:51] pacificmc1: none of it
[2:12:54] Colt_Engineer: yeah but that korthia being able to upgrade the gear to 233 took wayyyy too long
[2:13:00] klindatu: 40 new mounts in 9.2 so far
[2:13:11] pacificmc1: I like that Zereth Mortis has no player power, but at the same time that just means I won't do any of it KEKW

[2:13:15] Kisswani: I only need desolace to get loremaster an I refuse to do that damn zone

[2:13:39] CrusaderNero: mecha island had no player power no?
[2:13:57] pacificmc1: Probably best with a balance, some player power but not too much and not something that'll take forever
[2:13:59] stokes_t: i cant stand wow systems... i leveled my lock destro thinking i could switch to affliction for pvp.... too bad that requires new legendaries/covenants/conduit... so ill prob just quit

[2:14:37] pacificmc1: They need to add new mount achievements
[2:14:40] klindatu: and we still dont know the mythic mount and the ahead the curve one, i think
[2:14:48] Poriand: they should make older expansion gear up res so its more worth it to grind older sets for looks
[2:15:09] CrowCommando: I haven't had fun in a game in 15 years
[2:15:10] Heero_Effect: Eh yeah but how many variations of mounts can you do?

[2:24:16] Rottencoarse: @mavericks312  yeah tell some1 to stream OP then get insta banned in 5 minutes XD
[2:24:34] S1appadabass: i still need kyrian and maldraxxus mounts from korthia

[2:25:15] rohdey: bloodshards in Kul Tiras
[2:25:18] Bahamut145: Have you done the riddle to unlock the mount from Kosumoth mount?
[2:25:23] klindatu: get 20 shards from nag
[2:25:23] balanira: @Towelliee kosmuath is other way around you do the questchain to spawn the wq and then the wq gives the mount
[2:25:30] Bugszy: do you have lucid nightmare - the mount with the maze at the end
[2:25:32] stokesaford: @Towelliee Are you enjoying the game?
[2:26:01] Bahamut145: Yeah, Fanthom Dweller i think
[2:26:02] balanira: fathom sweller
[2:26:10] balanira: dweller*
[2:26:32] stokesaford: I haven't played WoW in awhile but I am on and off in the loop
[2:26:48] balanira: it takes !1h to spawn the wq and wq rotate every 2 week for a mount or a pet @Towelliee
[2:26:51] Sediz: wasnt it a rotation of which wq, one gave mount and gave the pet?
[2:27:00] OhNoNotAgain: @Towelliee you see that google spreadsheet I started making for ya with notes on the mounts? If its helpful i can keep editing it and make any changes you want?
[2:27:03] Sediz: after done the questchain, for fathom dweller?
[2:27:06] Kriach: its reward from weekly wq
[2:27:15] dabears5192: depends on the world quest
[2:27:20] magemaster225: if you want like a day grind, there's a mount tied to killing every tormentor that spawns in the maw every 2 hrs
[2:27:22] Bahamut145: You do, but the wq might not have the mount
[2:27:26] Kriach: its global
[2:27:35] Srgskug: no, there is pet reward now
[2:27:42] Colt_Engineer: sir you're up here, I'm going to need you to come down here
[2:27:58] Narmus_: !games
[2:27:59] griffdog125: Lmao
[2:28:07] balanira: if you do the questchain wq spawn forever though so you can do the questchain whenever
[2:28:09] Rapunzele: @Towelliee you can do the chain quest, but its not guarenteed to get the world quest for the mount today
[2:28:12] Bahamut145: Mount does not show up as a reward for people who already have it though i believe
[2:28:17] Shockey187: simple answer its not available atm
[2:28:49] dabears5192: its actually very similar to lucid nightmare, to get the prereq item that is.
[2:28:53] Kisswani: does that chain start in Broken Shore ?
[2:29:03] S1appadabass: i think the eggs are a daily drop
[2:29:03] cahoots82: the 2nd egg takes a while too
[2:29:14] Kriach: so u would go back next day
[2:29:25] cahoots82: yeah, 1st egg is easy. 2nd egg is some farming typically

[3:26:08] jerexify: I got it with no WQ and as Venthyr.
[3:26:08] KingSlayerYotam: i think it can drop on 50s too
[3:26:20] OhNoNotAgain: Each boss has a chance to drop it once a day, so you have 4 chances each day.
[3:26:21] geokouts: check arena up for the rare
[3:26:25] fletch8: any cov
[3:26:35] fletch8: no wq dis not to be up
[3:26:37] youzeon: Can u tease something about 10.0?
[3:26:37] crematedBrain: @Towelliee I got it as kyrian with no WQ or daily quest. 391 total attempts.
[3:26:39] Shmunky_: If the rare is up in arena you have to be necro for that one to drop
[3:26:48] Shmunky_: that is just an arena boss
[3:26:58] jerexify: @Towelliee Have to loot the boss.
[3:27:01] pronkk_: no there is a rare spawn from teh necro cov in that arena too
[3:27:03] OhNoNotAgain: @Shmunky_ thats a different one
[3:27:06] ThickCityBish: its a drop
[3:27:08] Mecabeast: auto
[3:27:08] balanira: the necrolord rare is not important since you just bought the mount
[3:27:08] magemaster225: there's a Necrolord only anima conductor rare in the top left
[3:27:13] kuiper_ow: there is an other boss that drop mount
[3:27:15] geokouts: check the arena bosses and see if the rare is up
[3:27:17] Aquadriel: theres 2 bosses from arena. one from lvl 3 anima conductor and the one you are trying now
[3:27:22] fletch8: loot
[3:27:28] pronkk_: no
[3:27:33] Rapunzele: different color
[3:27:38] Wcvechten: The one you bought is from anima conductor, the one you have left is different here
[3:27:39] pronkk_: youre going for the battlebound warhound
[3:27:39] jerexify: @Towelliee There's a MORE rare arena boss here that they're talking about.
[3:27:45] balanira: no you bought the necrolord rare not the hyena @Towelliee
[3:27:49] Bahamut145: You bought the Sabriel one i think
[3:27:55] magemaster225: there's 2 mounts there. one you bought the other is rare
[3:28:12] onybear: Well there is a drop on the first attempt in the arena but Sabriel (rare) also drops a mount
[3:28:20] m3rk_zion: I got the Hyena unknowingly, I went to the repair vendor outfront and was getting rid of trash.... and seen it in my bags XD
[3:28:22] Atokad2887: towSkinTowel
[3:28:38] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  4 bosses

[3:29:17] nightmayor12: Who are you rooting for in the playoffs this year?
[3:29:24] at1c: If only you where Undead lol
[3:29:24] DxDamn: oke listen there are actually 2 mounts from that arena you can get, 1 that can drop from every boss in there, and there is a rare mob that can drop a mount as well, that will take in the spot of 1 of the elite mobs there you need to do a full circle of all 4 mobs, but you need a the anima building to be linked to the arena @Towelliee

[5:36:19] happybooger: @Towelliee the dk mount changes with the spec
[5:36:30] Winttyrr: a while
[5:36:32] balanira: @Towelliee only pala warlock hunter rouge have more than 1
[5:36:38] dracullus: 5 minutes
[5:36:38] Rottencoarse: yeah it'll take a while
[5:36:40] draconisraccoonis: are you talking about orderhall mounts or the broken shore mount
[5:36:44] tomcruise210: thats weird why did pally get 4 ?
[5:36:45] Winttyrr: @balanira rogue
[5:36:49] Slaydew: wait can every class have eachother class mounts`now?
[5:36:49] Rottencoarse: @draconisraccoonis  order hall
[5:36:56] tomcruise210: no
[5:36:58] thorined: took me few days
[5:37:01] Agk90_: breaching the tomb
[5:37:04] Rudric_Ice: doesn't mage have like 3 or some shit ?
[5:37:04] PokerFaceMoose: isnt there one part you have to wait on something that only spawns at certain times of day?
[5:37:05] Bayne77: yeah, part of it was time gated, wasnt it?
[5:37:06] brewss: i remember doing every class for the mounts and how soul destroying it was
[5:37:07] sngtokos: i thought they added skips to orderhall or something recently
[5:37:14] sgtalash: pala have more usable mounts per character
[5:37:14] Lockrocker: i want to wee Towelliee play a warlock... lol
[5:37:15] BoezIRL: you have to do all the story
[5:37:18] thorined: since the misions take really long and you have to complete them to progress the story
[5:37:23] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee you only have to do the order hall campaign  and can skip the borken shore campaign
[5:37:32] balanira: @Towelliee they made the pre req account wide a while ago so rn you just need to do the questlines
[5:37:35] Winttyrr: hour per mission
[5:37:40] Winttyrr: some are 5 in a row. some are more
[5:37:47] jerexify: @Towelliee I have them all. Here's the list: 1 DK, 4 Paladin, 4 Rogue, 1 Monk, 1 DK, 1 Shaman, 3 Hunter, 3 Warlock, 1 Priest, 1 Mage, 1 DH.
[5:37:58] happybooger: @Towelliee pally and rogues have 4 mounts, locks and hunter have 3, everything else has 1
[5:38:01] Winttyrr: @Towelliee you ought to go start some class hall shit now so you can get mission tables going
[5:38:09] jerexify: Sorry, second DK is DH.
[5:38:13] cendriii: !huolon
[5:38:13] Moobot: @cendriii Dragon Penis Mount FTW https://clips.twitch.tv/ResilientAntediluvianWallabyWow-zc098vmbXc4LgnDw
[5:38:42] jerexify: 1 DK, 1 Warrior, 1 DH is what that should have been.
[5:38:44] Rudric_Ice: didn't DK had 3 for each individual spec ?
[5:38:52] happybooger: rogue first
[5:39:01] jerexify: @Rudi_Ice Nope. Just changed colors depending on spec. 1 mount, though.
[5:39:05] Gingerprimer: @Rudi_Ice they change based on spec
[5:39:10] Lockrocker: @Rudi_Ice DK has 1 mount. it changes color with each spec
[5:39:19] Rudric_Ice: oh k
[5:39:19] happybooger: @Rudi_Ice it is 1 mount but changes with the spec
[5:39:46] tomcruise210: why did pally get so many
[5:40:03] Gingerprimer: @tomcruise210 their recouls are from a vendor
[5:40:32] CrusaderNero: just recolors

[5:40:40] Rudric_Ice: you got all the mounts from Arathi ?
[5:40:58] balanira: some of them change color for different specs some of them are just more @Towelliee
[5:41:01] Winttyrr: they each had different sources. you got the original paladin mount from completing the campaign. the others are from maxing the spec artifacts @Towelliee
[5:41:05] Winttyrr: on paladin
[5:41:27] tomcruise210: @Gingerprimer i know i have them all lol i was just curious why they got 4 instead of just 1 that changes color lol
[5:41:41] Lockrocker: the need to give Blood Elf Paladins their on class mounts already. a Holy Hawkstrider... lol
[5:41:45] Winttyrr: @tomcruise210 read my message
[5:41:46] jerexify: @Winttyrr That might have been how it was in Legion, but now you just buy them. I have them all and I didn't play Paladin in Legion, and certainly don't have the weapons maxed.
[5:41:47] Jonrain: Did you do the darkshore and arathi mounts already? theyre both up rn
[5:42:18] Winttyrr: @jerexify i think that is kind of obvious...... you cant do anything with artifacts anymore
[5:42:48] tomcruise210: @Winttyrr oh thanks
[5:42:56] griffdog125: Arbieg arrr
[5:43:18] jerexify: @Winttyrr May be obvious to you or me, but there's a lot of people giving a lot of wrong information in this chat, with a lot of questions.
[5:43:23] Bashar_Strygar: @Towelliee Balcones is a good distillery from Texas
[5:44:05] plushack: !simple
[5:44:14] CardinalTX: Not going to drink for 6 months!   Already planning to fail!  Kappa LUL
[5:44:32] Gingerprimer: @tomcruise210 guess they just decided that some recols are "for the spec" and not for the class but it is more likely since they are independatly devoloped that their designer mad them that way and there is no over arching "reason" for the diff
[5:44:46] TexValhalla: GrittyTexan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! hoot
