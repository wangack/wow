[6:09:25] polkalock: What are your thoughts on a instanced gurubashi arena (like 2v2s) for an endgame PvP option?
[6:09:27] kataxxx: KEKZ 󠀀
[6:09:29] body_type_two: KEKZ
[6:09:32] g_1_t: KEKZ 󠀀
[6:09:46] Sqwibbie: no arena pls rated rbgs ofc
[6:10:00] mrciannu: u don t want rated bgs
[6:10:16] mrciannu: it will be just druids mages priests
[6:10:18] polkalock: @Sqwibbie Not everyone has 10 friends to queue warsong with.
[6:10:24] mrciannu: melees wont have that fun
[6:10:45] gambini66: shamans LUL
[6:10:52] Jumpka: he didn't have sham rage I think
[6:11:00] Sqwibbie: @polkalock its classic wow :) find them or a group to play with or put one together its super easy
[6:11:06] Jumpka: he used it in a duel against that other guy
[6:11:19] gambini66: would of been up only 1 min c/d
[6:11:22] Sqwibbie: @mrciannu nah there will be rogues and shamans :)
[6:11:28] sketchie711: So easy for a pally to take down a mage tho...
[6:11:28] polkalock: With all the new PvP content requiring a minimum of 5 people I think it would be a great addition to have some sort of 2v2 or 1v1 since people already do it (like in this stream)

[6:12:53] Dmorgz: dont they get immunity for like 5 seconds after the decoy is killed still
[6:12:58] Soul_Linked: what spec you level with as mage ? made my first mage @zigoftw
[6:13:14] exzages: Jo Ziqo, whats the best and worst class in pvp in your eyes?
[6:13:50] thamysticog: im pretty sure your pet could solo the warrior as BM
[6:13:56] Tandersonp99: warrior feels bad man

[6:14:37] simonhebo: some sort of durability
[6:14:40] mysticmacmage: bladestorm
[6:14:40] canceled__: shattering blow
[6:14:40] prodigy_wow: Auto attacks piece shields
[6:14:40] psykfall69: @polkalock yeah ofc 10v10 etc will be very limited to a meta comp, 2v2 and smaller brackets every comp will have some kind of counter atleast
[6:14:42] candlecan: avatar
[6:14:42] weeedzygg: blade storm is too much mobility in my opinion
[6:14:43] Snowdead20: warr need warr to be good again
[6:14:44] Kala: nice to see u too gamer
[6:14:49] dumbneko: free AHK rune and bladestorm

[6:15:08] body_type_two: second wind and spell reflect someone said
[6:15:17] Tandersonp99: 200 dmg mortal strikes suck
[6:15:17] sketchie711: Duel for gooolllllld. I love GOOOLLLLDDDD
[6:15:27] psykfall69: bladestorm with titans grip and leap is a few minor improvements they should add next patch
[6:15:39] thamysticog: avatar bladestorm heroic leap and cos warriors need
[6:15:52] thamysticog: and a flat 30% dmg buff
[6:16:11] simonhebo: they need to port in MoP warrior and then they will be good
[6:16:12] body_type_two: @mrciannu  how good dwas Marcos Assunção
[6:16:31] feardachiken: mage op?
[6:16:34] mrciannu: @body_type_two assuncao ma come fao
[6:16:38] st0neh: Warriors need to not have like multiple runes that do slightly different versions of the same thing
[6:16:59] hotmanpop: mages have living flame, i feel like warriors can have some broken shit too like bladestorm
[6:17:04] mrciannu: @body_type_two he was the slowest player ever, but every free kick was a goal or close to it
[6:17:04] thamysticog: MoP Classic is near
[6:17:15] weeedzygg: @Ziqoftw someone told me rank max poly makes poly brake less what u think?
[6:17:24] Jumpka: does living flame check resistance on every tick or just the initial cast?
[6:17:31] body_type_two: @mrciannu slow  but technically good, like pirlo ?
[6:17:32] weeedzygg: @Ziqoftw ahaha ye
[6:17:32] st0neh: Everyone needs a bunch more hp right now
[6:17:45] nbpeu: mt uncle works on the SoD dev team and he says the same thing about high rank poly
[6:18:09] st0neh: Easiest move from Blizzard is probably a rune that reduces PVP damage taken though
[6:18:09] raffedup: You want to make a macro that downranks poly each time you cast it on the same target
[6:18:15] body_type_two: @mrciannu imagine having cafu and pannuci for right back, and cufre + candela for left.. insane
[6:18:19] Genysis13: are you running missile barrage?
[6:18:26] mrciannu: @body_type_two no he was only good to shot free kicks, he had a special tecnhnique to shoot u can watch on you tube
[6:18:33] Genysis13: would AB be bettter or is it too slow

[6:56:09] polkalock: gonna ask just 1 more time today lol, but I would love to hear your opinion on experimental instanced arenas in SoD. Everyone complains about nothing to do at 40, I think a less demanding PvP endgame would give more people incentive to log on.

[7:06:50] magnesiium1: is that norm?
[7:06:50] Rmont: yeah you can run dampening and not hurt your chrono
[7:07:04] hotmanpop: probably because it's a rune, must be affected by spell power only
[7:07:22] Lillkorea: @Ziqoftw what is your ms on NA servers atm? Since you live in sweden.
[7:08:12] ohlszon: @Lillkorea around 100 ms i would say
[7:08:57] Strakattackx: put a cancle aura macro in ur crono spell

[7:31:30] arieuh: can you show me yours?
[7:31:32] sportscolax: makes sense thanks!
[7:31:37] prodigy_wow: Do you need a reset if after 3 it will just go back to 1?
[7:31:40] yepstock: maybe do reset=target? idk if that would help

[7:32:26] d8a_gg: I think the guy was asking if 2 different sheep’s would work too
[7:32:30] zoner35: Thanks for explaining, would you explain that better with twitch prime 😉
[7:32:41] TwerkninjaPoker: i think you over think this Kappa
[7:32:48] TheGamingBoar: Ziqo so good at explaining! must be coz of the years of explaining arena shit to Pshero
[7:32:51] tokyopressOCE: doesn’t the lower ranks sheep for not as long?

[7:37:30] almightyheliks: isnt it because the grounding eats rank 1 sheep, so then the first sheep you hit on the sham is rank 2 which he trinkets and then when you resheep your third sheep its rank 1
