[0:13:30] Ortinoth: the event is ok, just wish the rare spawns in icecrown had about half the respawn time 7 hours to do them all is a bit to much
[0:13:54] MetallicusGaming: you don't have to do them in 1 day
[0:14:26] Ortinoth: you can do them 3 times a day
[0:14:50] cadi2021: 🕐😲🕐
[0:15:05] Svedling: but if you are after a specific item you have to wait for the full rotation, that sucks
[0:15:52] Ortinoth: yes thats what i am saying if your wait thats at least 6 hours 40 min if you miss it
[0:15:59] Svedling: yup
[0:16:02] The__Redcoat: rough
[0:16:09] The__Redcoat: especially for full time workers
[0:16:23] Ortinoth: if respawns were 10 min would be about 4 hours wait
[0:16:34] Svedling: i wouldnt mind if each rare had its own timer so you can switch between them
[0:16:55] Ortinoth: and try doing this on more then 1 character

[0:29:06] Ortinoth: @DunnwichDK i still think the spawn time is a bit to long tbh
[0:31:19] DunnwichDK: yeah these spawn times are rough
[0:31:24] DunnwichDK: you can only get 3 per hour
[0:31:35] Ras_Aku: 15min would have been good
[0:31:40] kranztheman: @Ortinoth How so? There are 20 rares. Kill the same one every 6 hrs and 40 mins for the next two weeks. Thats easily plenty of time to farm specific ones for gear.
[0:32:03] Ortinoth: 3 per hour it will take you 7 hours for 1 toon to complete the rotation @cranstheman
[0:32:08] DunnwichDK: darn near can time when a boss will be up you need

[2:27:47] zigzugg: water walking shoes?
[2:27:50] MILESkg21: they dont want the 1440p because of TV's not supporting it yet :)
[2:27:56] XxMaDDoG2020xX: is anyone having freezes since the prepatch expansion?

[2:28:58] MOLAR305: yea i dont know why they did tht
[2:29:10] rsimpson105: I remember them saying that TV tech is up to like some ridiculous level but they are spacing out when they release it so people gradually get used to the quality getting better and better
[2:29:11] zigzugg: battle ready :)
[2:29:16] Mecabeast: took me an hour and a half last week to tame oondasta people were pissed lol

[2:30:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: what the hell is asmon gonna do if he can't watch youtube Kappa
[2:30:41] MILESkg21: its not safe anymore monkaS
[2:30:44] Kriven: its sad that facebook is ahead of twitch in finding solutions for music on streams
[2:30:48] Larc9783: Music industry is leaning hard into twitch for money lol
[2:30:50] Masqerader: @TwixxHD yes
[2:31:06] greedysob: lol no i dont think it is. doesnt show much tho.
[2:31:08] Masqerader: vod views combine stream views + vod views
[2:31:10] m3rk_zion: Honestly it makes me scared to play games and show people... It's a shit show is a major understatement.
[2:31:13] MOXP: the rocket knows where it is
[2:31:14] TheCliffyShow: A literally shitshow would mean it's someone showing actual shit.
[2:31:18] Got2bekidding: there is apparently a bot now that will listen for dmca music while you are streaming
[2:31:22] Flocked21: so you are safe just rocking WoW music in the background?
[2:31:33] L00deFame: @XxMaDDoG2020xX i have no idea, all i know is that my pc is fine and this only happened after the new update, i might need to update my graphic card or something
[2:31:40] DeeterDo: whats defined as cooperated?
[2:31:55] zigzugg: battle ready :)
[2:31:57] XxMaDDoG2020xX: mine has frozen twice and that has never happened before either
[2:31:58] widdlewage: A few Artists are putting together royalty free like Tpain
[2:32:01] Shadow_Feroenix: Steamraider ready.
[2:32:13] TheCliffyShow: We didn't poke the bear. We took a golf club to it's balls.
[2:32:18] L00deFame: @XxMaDDoG2020xX check your graphic card might need an update
[2:32:19] Scojan: Correct, they combined them
[2:32:19] Kriven: Towelliee just gonna need to go into the studio and drop his own album to play on stream lol
[2:32:49] Excluzionz: @Towelliee did you complete project 50 haven't tuned in a while
[2:33:02] Larc9783: Probably just giving them a big sack of money to shut up
[2:33:25] Masqerader: think the band the midnight said people can use their music on stream, they're not to bad.. that 80s synthwave sound
[2:33:27] widdlewage: tpain already has a royalty free website for stream music
[2:33:30] Flocked21: funny thing is - i have purchased songs after hearing them on stream - shocked they dont consider it free advertising
[2:33:40] mayonaes: wait are argent commendation account wide?
[2:33:52] Scojan: Live bans typically come from news stations
[2:33:55] Craetos_: that was him being dumb
[2:33:57] faulen: Why can't they just give them some of your sub money?
[2:34:00] Masqerader: DMCA is so out of date and not being used as intended
[2:34:03] Bonedit: bigger streamers can
[2:34:09] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee Hasan has been playing cnn and fox since election week
[2:34:29] bigbutteredbeans: ^
[2:34:30] onelegalthief: There was other streamers with 250k viewers that didnt get banned for the same thing though. Streaming election coverage and nothing happened
[2:34:49] Eviltuna13: i will agree on that
[2:35:00] Tr3th0n: and increase the ban time the more often you get banned
[2:35:00] widdlewage: the bad thing is people are loosing faith with Twitch with how they are handling it.
[2:35:01] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP
[2:35:06] Dank_The_Cripple: im surprised they have not just come up some kind of pay to use dmca music
[2:35:08] Vivelli: yeah thats only only good if they arent banning for wind noises tho
[2:35:17] catlinv: Nah. People will apuse that like how they abuse copyright on ytr
[2:35:18] nullifie: Hasan has a contract with Twitch that lets him play those, he is very careful about DMCA
[2:35:19] luckyunderachiever: it would be all the sub money tho
[2:35:19] Masqerader: we also live in the age stupid, and people don't learn
[2:35:26] Craetos_: @onelegalthief Hasan wasnt streaming fox news btw :)
[2:35:27] luckyunderachiever: if you go by the way they do it on youtube
[2:35:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: 50 Cents a sub Kappa
[2:35:27] nahro0: or something with amazon music
[2:35:34] Ms7Mido: imagine twitch and spotify partnership that would be great
[2:35:34] Scojan: Its just going to be real bad once a large streamer gets sued, since twitch keeps all deleted content @Towelliee
[2:35:34] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[2:35:38] Rippan: yeah a licens, just like any other company has to do
[2:35:38] Frankenclyde: morning towelliee
[2:35:46] Hregor: you should pay a percentage rather than a set fee, otherwise newcomer streamers couldnt make it
[2:35:50] Kriven: The thing is I don't even care about music on streams. If its in the games I like it but I don't need to hear peoples spotify playlists sadly dmca is just smacking everything
[2:35:53] Dank_The_Cripple: yea lol
[2:35:54] MILESkg21: or amazon music maybe :P
[2:35:54] onelegalthief: @Craetos_ based on his political views I would imagine lol
[2:35:59] 91Niki: Yeah they should developed some sort of sub system to play copyrighted music without getting dmca.
[2:36:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: jeff bezos throws his dick on the table and says stop
[2:36:12] Dank_The_Cripple: i think it would take more than a billion though :\
[2:36:15] Synthez542: What about amazon music?
[2:36:17] Masqerader: why artist are starting to make their own labels now, to get away from this shit
[2:36:23] Mogwaimonk: Starting to look alot like the movie Idiocacy in the real world
[2:36:25] yunggluten: They'd take that billion dollars and still dmca strike everyone the could
[2:36:44] onelegalthief: @Mogwaimonk I literally said the same thing to my brother last night lol
[2:36:50] Eviltuna13: Who made the 3 strikes and your out policy? Twitch or the DMCA people
[2:36:57] nssb89034236: i think they can if they really want to
[2:37:00] MILESkg21: twitch did
[2:37:01] Scojan: They probably are going to get fined hard. Since they are storing deleted copyright content already
[2:37:03] Giantnoggin: !wa
[2:37:03] Moobot: we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at https://wago.io/search/luxthos || For the green leveling exp WA, you can find that our !discord under the #ui-and-wa-info channel!
[2:37:04] Mogwaimonk: lol
[2:37:09] TwixxHD: gl
[2:37:10] TwixxHD: F
[2:37:20] JakeStratic: I was thinking they should create a Spotify/Youtube music coordination. You go to a stream and there is a click here to listen to what the streamer is listening to button. So it isn't technically on your stream @Towelliee
[2:37:22] IronDanTV: IronDanTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! Am I cool yet?!
[2:37:22] Moobot: @IRONDANTV with the 43 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[2:37:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: make a overlay that displays the name of copyrighted songs with a link to where viewers can buy the song
[2:37:39] Masqerader: icc dance off
[2:37:41] TheBenShee: twitch doesnt do anything other then fucking people over. they told people to delete all clips and vods and still ban people because they have all the shit still on there servers? like wtf? why tell people to delete your past carrier when it still fucks you sideways?
[2:37:41] Masqerader: ?
[2:37:47] Eviltuna13: Then why can't Twitch change there policy to get a DMCA strike 24h ban not the 3 strike rule
[2:37:47] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter! https://twitter.com/towelthetank and on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/user/Consolecrusader towHAMUP
[2:37:59] Cristoff90: I figured sub sunday intro got tagged lol.
[2:38:00] Moobot: Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE MAW HAMMER shirt is LIVE! Only around for 14 Days! https://www.dbh.la/mawhammer
[2:38:19] Strouss: so if you see one of your videos "muted Audio" its flagged?
[2:38:25] fullryuga: What app do you use to to update your addons?
[2:38:26] Masqerader: lol
[2:38:41] MetallicusGaming: fullryuga he uses curseforge
[2:38:57] fullryuga: @MetallicusGaming thx brother
[2:38:58] Strouss: wtf all i ever use is Pretzel..... supposed to be "safe"
[2:39:08] Hazno: Facebook Gaming actually did it right and recently got into a partnership with the major music labels to allow their streamers to play copyrighted music, but then again Facebook has infinite money PepeHands
[2:39:09] zigzugg: battle ready :)
[2:39:13] Mirtiori: they would have to partner with youtube to get it up so fast
[2:39:18] SoloGrey: !TWITCH
[2:39:32] MetallicusGaming: !twitch
[2:39:33] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP
[2:39:35] Grum1610: @Towelliee saw a gta rp guy got a warning because the police car sirens are flagging.
[2:39:40] Eviltuna13: I havent see Alinity and Amouranth get a Strike for them playing Just Dance
[2:39:43] nullifie: Those would fall under fair use.
[2:39:43] GrimpoTheCephalopod: So can you play copyrighted music for live stream and than just delete vods?
[2:39:43] Ortinoth: @Towelliee i have been hearing streamers are being banned for in game music due to DMCA the past couple weeks
[2:39:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: at the bare minimum they need to find a way to allow music from games
[2:40:00] Hazno: @GrimpoTheCephalopod in practice, yes, but in theory, not really
[2:40:01] Zettabyte: DMCA is a shitshow right now
[2:40:02] Masqerader: I think Terry was saying he was gonna change his cause his "fucking with my kliq" one
[2:40:09] 91Niki: @Towelliee Not gonna lie, shit like this makes me not even wanna attempt to start streaming. I'd just be anxious non stop that I played something that would cause a DMCA LUL
[2:40:11] TheCliffyShow: Thank god I use a custom soundbite for my alerts.
[2:40:16] Waspire: see ya.
[2:40:26] TheBenShee: that GTA RP dude who plays a cop and got DMCA for the police siren LOL
[2:40:33] MILESkg21: and people were warned months ahead of it LUL
[2:40:39] dante4147: @Towelliee did you saw Devin's YT video? Twitch still haves the vods and clips in public servers and you can still get DMCA coz of that. Even if you deleted everything in your dashboard
[2:40:51] linkzz96: what you got going on right now bud? @Towelliee
[2:40:56] Masqerader: Amazon should just buy the music industry period
[2:40:59] Ponickz: Redux09 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! good morning
[2:40:59] Moobot: Thanks @REDUX09 for subbing for 4 months! towHAMUP
[2:41:08] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee I understand DMCA for other peoples music without rights, but if it is in a game it shouldnt be able to be DMCAed
[2:41:09] nullifie: The automation of DMCA takedowns are what causes the most stress. Some of the stuff they go after are completely fair use as per the law.
[2:41:10] Giantnoggin: If anyone is using Towels xp WA did it break yesterday for you and what did you do to fix it?
[2:41:11] TwoStubbyCorgis: TwoStubbyCorgis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:41:11] Moobot: Thanks for subbing for 7 months, @TWOSTUBBYCORGIS towHAMUP
[2:41:11] Djaygam3s: my very first video I ever put up on Youtube got taken down due to copyright on the game. The game had music that was not communicated it was a copyright soundtrack. (it was an indie horror game off of gamejolt)
[2:41:14] Iver_monk: Might as well just mute the game while your playing at this point dam
[2:41:21] linkzz96: 2 buddies got banned for DMCA for clips they deleted over a year ago..
[2:41:39] jaalexba: I've seen a few people talking about recording music on a different track and it seems to help with muted VODs.
[2:41:39] kethull: Hello everyone
[2:41:41] SilentBlitz520: @Towelliee I just wanna say you are one of my favorite streamers, and are one of the reasons I got into streaming myself!!! So keep up the good work, its really difficult to build a following and now I have even great appreciation for you lol!!
[2:41:49] Mogwaimonk: Thanks Metallica
[2:41:51] Strouss: i did a election coverage video with fox, cnn on it they never did anything, but i just deleted it anyway lol
[2:41:51] TheCliffyShow: I worry about streaming Just Dance.
[2:42:03] Scojan: I would think they are breaking safe harbour by keeping that copyright content to restore
[2:42:06] Mecabeast: imagine the people trying to get into streaming and are dbl digit viewers having to make sure nothing is copyrighted
[2:42:18] TheTwoToneRebel: from what you have seen so far how do you think Shadowlands will preform, really on the fence about coming back to wow
[2:42:19] Hazno: yeah, RIP Just Dance, Beat Saber, Guitar Hero etc
[2:42:21] MisterBongwater: In-game music is a problem. Pretty sure my Fall Guys clips were getting muted but Delvolver fixed it
[2:42:22] Neowanderer: dammit lars why did you kill napster
[2:42:26] MILESkg21: i miss the napster days BibleThump
[2:42:29] Iver_monk: They pretty much started it lol
[2:42:35] Larc9783: Lars needs his golden toilet
[2:42:36] Ponickz: Mettallica single handed wipe out napster and limewire
[2:42:38] Flocked21: Metallica and Napster - the downfall of free music
[2:42:38] Welshjemz: RIP Napster
[2:42:48] Secondbreakfasttt: How is Destiny 2 going, aru overwhelmed yet LUL
[2:42:49] Mogwaimonk: They were the roiginal peeps wanting the revenue from people listening to the music for free, SO I get it
[2:43:00] Masqerader: lol i deleted a ghostbusters vod from 2 years ago, cause all those theme songs
[2:43:19] Scojan: Friday the 13th has a DMCA option now
[2:43:25] Ryan_yep: Control has that option
[2:43:26] MisterBongwater: Time to play Holst - The Planets on loop
[2:43:33] Kriven: @flocked21 i mean it was technically theft lol it was not "free"
[2:43:41] TheCliffyShow: So does that mean music in a game can get you DMCA striked? Because I stream Just Dance sometimes.
[2:43:45] Motivess: do the regional chests for fast light lvl boosts @towelliee
[2:43:57] Hazno: @TheCliffyShow if the music is copyrighted, yes
[2:44:00] Secondbreakfasttt: i wanna see how godfall is
[2:44:05] Hybridwarhawk: If it is copyrighted music then yes you are at risk
[2:44:06] Escalprillo: wow at least has the mute music option
[2:44:14] MILESkg21: nothing like a muted wow stream Kappa
[2:44:20] Scojan: Wow doesn't buy music from other companies, they create their own
[2:44:20] Ryan_yep: So hopefully newer games will get with the times and enable you to mute all copyrighted songs
[2:44:28] AtriseOW: @Towelliee How many 50s ya got now?
[2:44:35] Masqerader: 49?
[2:44:48] MOXP: LOL
[2:44:49] MMokuin: LUL
[2:44:50] 91Niki: LUL
[2:44:51] Hazno: [Upbeat music}
[2:44:53] TheTwoToneRebel: lmao
[2:44:53] Hazno: ]
[2:44:53] TheBenShee: @Towelliee they tell people do delete all shit but why if it does NOTHING to save you because it's not deleted at all? it's literally like the UK twitch twitter asking people to tweet there best scare clips at them ONE DAY after everyone started to delete shit.... twitch doesnt care.
[2:44:57] TheCliffyShow: @Hazno That sucks! It's a game focused on music. Not very much fun to stream it muted.
[2:45:02] Flocked21: @Kriven LOL - I know - if I was metallica - I would have done teh same
[2:45:12] th30dor: man, the assassin's creed PC port is a piece of trash
[2:45:25] MisterBongwater: I wanted to stream No Man’s Sky but I’ve had problems with that music getting nailed in the past
[2:45:31] MisterBongwater: It sucks
[2:45:38] Slowkill333: @Towelliee how crazy would it be if this led to some issues between companies because of stolen sounds?
[2:45:38] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[2:45:43] ratJAMstan: I have memory leaks irl
[2:45:45] WhiteKnight74648: Think pornhub has the smacking sword copyrighted. Just be careful
[2:45:46] th30dor: sounds sometimes simply do not play. And that performance.. damn
[2:45:46] MILESkg21: it looks great it just doesnt run that great
[2:45:49] Syllvn: Playing on PC, no issues.
[2:46:00] Masqerader: it's a ubisoft game, you're all expecting to much
[2:46:00] Syllvn: Everything on Ultra, about 90FPS
[2:46:05] Larc9783: I sh9uld copyright random soudns and get paid
[2:46:05] koala_mimmie: @TheCliffyShow it sucks extra bad too for Osu streamers because its in a similar situation but if twitch ever steps up and fixes it, osu will probably still get DMCA'd since those are all fan made content for the game
[2:46:11] MILESkg21: even on a 3090 people are only getting 70fps LUL
[2:46:42] classictwo: are you done with stream raiders
[2:46:51] TheCorrosiveMan: some time ago lots of guitar youtuber got dmc'ed for playing a random chord
[2:46:51] Madnezz123: the game is not optimised
[2:46:57] MJadeS99: Has the scourge event happened yet or still waiting?
[2:47:01] MILESkg21: just a garbage engine
[2:47:01] TheCliffyShow: @Bombarda_Maxima Beat Saber is in that same boat.
[2:47:05] Daggerstry: It could also be that it is a CPU intensive game like WoW and GPUs do almost nothing
[2:47:07] Hazno: @MJadeS99 yes, it's live now
[2:47:09] Bogzeh: the game has some settings that murder fps and ppl dont know about them, it runs fine with them off
[2:47:10] MILESkg21: he was on a 5950x and a 3090
[2:47:28] MJadeS99: @hazno thanks!
[2:47:28] michaisn: I think if they made WoW to better utilize newer hardwer it wouldn't run worse on lower, and the majority plays with lower
[2:47:30] Eviltuna13: I tip my hat to Ubisoft. got AC on the ps4 and get a free copy for the Ps5 when i get one sacCHEERS
[2:47:33] Hazno: lol, I just got a delivery confirmation for my RTX 3080... December 1st NotLikeThis

[2:49:04] Sophizt: Funny part is Valhalla is running great on high preset with a OC 1060
[2:49:12] TheMounTing: welcome to twitch, where you delete your content and still get DMCA'd because they store everything on the backend
[2:49:14] d1stract10n: @MS7Midoo i tried it befor eand feter still sucked
[2:49:24] Alaquane: nvidia optimized drivers for valhalla came out 2 days ago
[2:49:25] Morpserie: threadripper?
[2:49:25] Ortinoth: I probally will never go AMD - i have always had really bad luck with them
[2:49:28] Creesy69: i'm waiting for my 5900X to get delivered
[2:49:30] Vivelli: still waiting to see those big navi benchmarks
[2:49:31] TombStoneMercenary: Cause when I want to listen to music I always want to hear meme sounds and people talking over my music.........

[2:49:46] TiPera: ty
[2:49:46] hsc1999: The record companies will end up losing money from this because game companies will stop licensing songs that get streamers DMCA'd because they want the streamers advertising their games.
[2:49:48] Alaquane: 6900xt nice
[2:50:04] Mecabeast: imagine beating a guitar hero player or beat saber player lol

[2:50:14] northcub: cooling fans on my AMD GPUs always made alot of niose and died out so I have never gone back

[2:50:27] Libbzy: blizzard should have made all the icecrown rares spawn every 20 mins not just one
[2:50:30] iworkoutsomtimes: Should alts even do the intro to BFA stuff or just go right into the prepatch event?
[2:50:35] MILESkg21: just use a water block
[2:50:44] ravagekiller12: @Towelliee why do streamers automatically get beta keys isnt that umfair to non streamers
[2:50:50] Kriven: i mean thats older gpus north new ones should be good or go third party sapphire etc

[2:51:01] Alaquane: weren't the rx 200/300/400 series were all the same card which was just an industrial heater
[2:51:02] Ms7Mido: @d1stract10n yeah its not optimized at all then i have 1070 and i7 4790
[2:51:02] Zorthul_: 5-10 min
[2:51:10] NonGloriaFero: 10 minutes lets you go back and turn in if you need too
[2:51:11] DunnwichDK: maybe they will lower the time in a week
[2:51:16] MrCacco: hey i got a lot of chores done yesterday waiting for spawn timer alarms! @Towelliee
[2:51:16] Creesy69: what do they drop?
[2:51:19] Ortinoth: atm its basicly 1 boss for every 7 hours
[2:51:24] Gaaralock: I've got like 5 rares up right now... where are all the morning wow peeps
[2:51:29] 420fortnitefan: It's so stupid!!
[2:51:30] philipd9889: hey that sme :D
[2:51:32] Vivelli: yeah i just alt tab and watch this stream while waiting
[2:51:37] Sandisy: this is wonderful for their bullshit MAU metric
[2:51:37] TiPera: im waiting while watching stream on 2nd monitor
[2:51:39] jaalexba: Will people be waiting like this when Shadowlands comes out?
[2:51:41] Iolgz: @Towelliee waiting is content Kappa
[2:51:43] MILESkg21: 5 my ass LUL
[2:51:44] GioMMG: I set up a timer and go do mount runs on alts
[2:51:51] northcub: farm Sha inbetween rare spawns
[2:51:52] Ponickz: yea
[2:51:54] d1stract10n: @MS7Midoo hopefully they fix it soon maybe if its fast enough i'll get it again
[2:51:54] Gaaralock: I'm on illidan and have 5 rares
[2:51:55] norgan30: yes they do
[2:51:57] intrepid003: yep, i had 4 when i logged in this AM
[2:52:00] Grankish: yuuup
[2:52:02] smashwow: yup he do
[2:52:03] Hazno: @Towelliee the RTX NVENC encoder is on par with x264 Slow preset at 8 Mbps btw, so a single RTX GPU in your streaming PC would suffice imo.. I would recommend watching EposVox's encoder quality analysis video
[2:52:05] Motivess: what a disaster of a pre expansion event, Legion was so much better
[2:52:08] yng_tc: @towelliee are the rares weekly or daily for loot?
[2:52:09] Vendael_: Yes just joined a server with 10 rares ready to be killed
[2:52:11] norgan30: Just spent 20 minutes flying around with a group killing all of them back to back
[2:52:13] Stradivarii: @Towelliee excuse me!! Its the perfect timing for when you wrok from home!
[2:52:15] Daggerstry: I have to farm Icecrown on 4 classes.... RIP me
[2:52:27] jaalexba: holy jiggawatts
[2:52:29] Grum1610: just 4?
[2:52:32] Ms7Mido: @d1stract10n they usually fix stuff like that all matter of time now hopefully soon
[2:52:49] Ogrul: LUL illidan if your not there after 2 secs he spawns
[2:52:57] Stradivarii: No point in farming it really though, is there? The catchup gear will be obsolete 1 lvl into the expac anyway
[2:53:13] Hazno: @Towelliee my point is a regular Ryzen 5 3600 GPU with an RTX 2060 would grant the same quality as X264 Slow in your streaming PC
[2:53:17] tinyturnip0: can u only loot the rares once a day?
[2:53:18] michaisn: I watched comparisons and slow vs medium doesn't seem to have a big difference in quality
[2:53:19] Hazno: *CPU
[2:53:25] d1stract10n: true
[2:53:30] TheCliffyShow: I've only missed a rare once. Even when flying halfway across the zone.
[2:53:37] zigzugg: battle ready :)
[2:53:41] Papatiku: I got to level 50 with ilvl 60ish, super low for stuff (new player)
[2:53:44] Gibsonex937: i'm playing pathfinder and just leaving wow open on window mode with the map open lol
[2:53:45] DaWiR: It's 60... my new rouge is crying
[2:53:46] EverestTheFallen: i went from 50 to 101 yesterday
[2:53:50] pasda: yea farming on my new pala
[2:53:54] Kriven: twitch needs to freaking up the bitrate. I wanna watch more streams in 1440p
[2:53:55] pasda: ez scourge farm
[2:53:57] Alaquane: the free weapon from Nathanos is fantastic. I love it. the rng and slow grind for the rares is kind of lack luster
[2:54:08] Alaquane: I thought I would be able to gear up much faster
[2:54:09] Hika77: whats the name of that white dragon mount?
[2:54:11] Ortinoth: 53-54 you probally will be replacing prepatch gear
[2:54:18] Ortinoth: maybe sooner
[2:54:18] Mecabeast: towards end of maldraxus when I last leveled
[2:54:20] yng_tc: Anyone know if rare kills are weekly or daily for loot?
[2:54:23] TheItalianStallion321: this was just linked in my discord, seems pretty accurate. spawn timers for the rares in Icecrown https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkjq7hr-kyhpeA22rWzWw5DVAP1385sWFW42yTLdwJg/htmlview?pru=AAABdduz1Zs*F0EX413kk_BxMmQUTywuiQ#
[2:54:34] EverestTheFallen: also didnt have to grind az power and got a 110 neck
[2:54:36] Masqerader: @Towelliee You know what they should have done for this event, let you get argent tourney seals for those mounts as well.
[2:54:37] NonGloriaFero: I can tell you this now. No way im doing this on all my alts too
[2:54:38] MILESkg21: just the flex
[2:54:42] Impendngdoom: GOTTEM
[2:54:49] Ortinoth: @tc_x one kill per 6 hrs 40 min -
[2:54:51] ravagekiller12: @Towelliee why do streamers automatically get beta keys isnt that umfair to non streamers
[2:54:51] Hazno: @Towelliee people are stuck in the old mindset before the new RTX NVENC encoder was released
[2:54:52] dylandevsstuff: @Towelliee what does D2 mean from your discord message saying ur streaming?

[2:55:56] Hazno: yeah of course, if you've already got it, then why not :D
[2:55:59] michaisn: Nvec is only better if you compare it to very fast at lower bitrate
[2:56:09] Motivess: project Diablo 2 is a connection issue fest
[2:56:11] Degates1: I'd say if what you have works, why spend more money.
