[0:29:43] Tyferious: Or arcane
[0:29:45] GrimlockMMO: @mayonaes It was basically a must pick for DHs to take a talent that made all their abilities that did x damage, do chaos damage instead anyways.
[0:29:47] ItsBees: Why did he start the timer later for some classes?
[0:29:53] ItsBees: I know it's like the setup but that seems odd

[0:34:26] modzi_xd: WHAT THE HELLL
[0:34:29] zachgamegodx: 5stacks of death wish

[0:34:39] MisterThatDude: most of that was AoE too lmao
[0:34:40] Axtin: we need gnomobility death wish shuffles
[0:34:42] ItsBees: what's that one dude who comes up with the crazy one shots that do like a mil damage
[0:34:45] nikthevoker: i thought you couldnt buuild stacks of stuff
[0:34:48] auchenai7: warriors are built different

[0:35:21] NPBeharry: kalvish had the best intro
[0:35:25] NPBeharry: hands down
[0:35:30] Badasti: this was pretty entertaining to watch. The Ele Shaman bit is crazy, because after that initial insignificant dam he just gets globalled
[0:35:35] ItsBees: This guy needs to team up with Hurricane and make some vids
[0:35:39] FinkleTheMage: Did Aeg get to do Arcane?
[0:35:39] SweatyDaniels: best tmog def Axtin
[0:35:45] wackpoetic: Anyone else think it's funny that Ret or Boomy used to 1-shot in like .5 seconds in Shadowlands as part of their usual rotation in Arena?
[0:35:49] zachgamegodx: thing is that most ppl used unrealstiic tech to get their dmg out, sub and outlaw just used their normal arena strats to kill ppl rofl
[0:35:55] Axtin: buff feral
[0:35:57] GrimlockMMO: @FinkleTheMage Jah did

[0:38:16] Natetrix_: s tier dps this patch ?
[0:38:17] carneasada34: some dude in shuffle "healer bad" after instant death

[0:39:33] SirBeaverTeeth: hahah greater
[0:39:35] cipusanx: yep, i know sherlocks. the problem i was talking about but you guys are too blind is the cd stacking and the conditions they create. its a nice design for players that know how to play, not so much for casuals or new players.
[0:39:36] rekt1370: anyone guess the fastest burst
[0:39:55] NPBeharry: destro

[0:40:09] jporter_: dude your intro was dope
[0:40:22] moremantella255: dev could have been quicker
[0:40:28] Badasti: i love petkick, what a leg
[0:40:33] GrimlockMMO: Should have had me to dev intro tbh smh
[0:40:36] GrimlockMMO: Love Smex though
[0:40:48] anmusallam: That unholy burst was crazy
[0:40:55] Badasti: this was insane
[0:40:58] rekt1370: nicktherogue
[0:41:00] Kenny_77: yeah unholy can also keep it up
[0:41:08] ooPickleRicKoo: @cipusanx for a newbie, the game is really difficult. you are right. There is a high barrier of entry which is not good for wow pvp
[0:41:12] auchenai7: what
[0:41:12] dailyshuffle: what
[0:41:12] moremantella255: destro wins..

[0:42:49] wackpoetic: 4th place streamer Sadge
[0:42:53] ellisrainy: u made it in the thumbnail tho that's all that counts
[0:42:57] 인터넷포트: @nightmxz rain of fire makes bolts cast faster?
[0:43:07] dailyshuffle: how fast was mm hunter?
[0:43:10] magnesiium1: the arcane one shot is like 2% chanc ehappening. he needed the sphere and the surge to crit for it bang like that
[0:43:25] nightmxz: @인터넷포트 you get stacks from spending soul shards and at max stacks it reduces the cast time of chaos bolt by 50% or something
[0:43:37] kyleuselton: how excited are you for the upcoming AWC and early predictions
[0:43:42] Flokko: am i able to link a combat log from last night? i got oneshot by an ele in .4 seconds in an actual arena 99%-0
[0:43:45] Silentstormzyy: Can you show Bajheeras
[0:43:46] deckin4: need more people making fun vids like this
[0:43:48] CHMage: those one shots work in arena? @venruki
[0:43:51] dailyshuffle: not bad
[0:43:54] anmusallam: Speaking of awc, are you participating
[0:44:12] Kenny_77: Dukama took it like a challenge instead of a science experiment. I like that
[0:44:12] Silentstormzyy: Oh yea, he was .4 seconds slower than you so why did he get 3rd?
[0:44:24] Luigicamp: lol
[0:44:27] wackpoetic: STOP THE STEAL
[0:44:31] laalaaland22: 0.04 seconds slower...
[0:44:34] yesterday_potato: Whats that big announcement you eluded to the other day? Can you say yet?
[0:44:42] notkoalars: we got the evidence to show it !
[0:44:45] Dirkdigglier: Ven should be on the podium. He is the real bronze medalist
[0:44:47] dailyshuffle: hahah

[0:45:30] MisterThatDude: aff lock with the slowest burst by far :')
[0:45:31] Roidb0y: i still cant believe there wasnt any pvp tuning today
[0:45:32] Endoraesh: already subbed to his YT
[0:45:58] dailyshuffle: just watch it later ven, all good
[0:46:08] Luigicamp: he's moving to Switzerland
[0:46:16] GrimlockMMO: Ven secretly playing in the AWC instead of casting this year POG
[0:46:18] bump1: ven's competing rather than commenting this year for AWC
[0:46:22] ellisrainy: BIG ANNOUNCEMENT
[0:46:23] nimbus420i: Switzerland is lovey
[0:46:35] kyleuselton: hey @venruki any early predicitons for the AWC anything your looking forward to

[0:47:34] SirBeaverTeeth: isnt the second team in EU better than all NA teams? oops
[0:47:38] stephen12309: are serers down?
[0:47:41] johnnyquestz: variety is the spice of life
[0:47:46] nightmxz: It's more fun to watch when the games are close
[0:47:49] magnesiium1: everyone loves to see a dynasty fall
[0:47:56] NPBeharry: it’s definitely not fun if the same team wins over and over you were right the first time
[0:47:57] n0bodygood: liquid winning was way better because it was luminosity they beat
[0:47:58] Lucaz_H: is pmake competing?
[0:47:59] stephen12309: are servers down?
[0:48:06] girlz__: wow arena is too hard to get into so there wont be a lot of new teams, plus the incentive to be good at arena isnt there
[0:48:08] n0bodygood: sad to see luminosity go
[0:48:08] SwiisH_Tv: bro put the whistle down
[0:48:10] gdodmebxu: Pog

[0:48:21] figurines: I hope its not just all sub/X/rdruid mirrors. that would be the saddest AWC
[0:48:24] chaps_86: Thats nasty
[0:48:31] Nachofez: thats a nasty roster
[0:48:33] wolfcy_94: its our competition,, they represent us and im fine with it, but yeee, i would love to see some other players come up as well, but probably will still be echo.. too much knowledge and practise
[0:48:39] SwiisH_Tv: excited to see the young guns kalvish and nick
[0:48:39] magnesiium1: kubzy chun ww/arcane is going to be filthy good

[0:48:57] deckin4: eww kubzy has literally snatched my soul in solo recently. im owed some mmr

[0:49:04] Pingabreath: what are you holding?
[0:49:05] Ronn_Deezy: was there no rogues in the video?
[0:49:09] nightmxz: Wealthyman and Kubzy on diff teams is crazy
[0:49:15] macdeezyx: didnt echo change healers? Lontar now instead of Mehh. Cause I feel like that's fairly big change
[0:49:15] SwiisH_Tv: @Primecuban thats his big whistle

[0:49:22] yungtropikal: bros gettin close with that whistle
[0:49:24] Borngood: Any new players?
[0:49:25] NPBeharry: they haven’t announced it but they play together every day so it’s not a huge secret
[0:49:32] BLOOKTROOP: 10/10 would root for a ven supa ziqo team
[0:49:33] NPBeharry: I’ll miss flop
[0:49:33] wolfcy_94: kalvish gonna go crazyy, i feel it
[0:49:33] girlz__: what do you think would make wow arena actually fun to spectate ven? what do u think they need to do
[0:49:41] biofreaks: Is there a list of the teams already? Sorry, just tuned in.
[0:49:44] kyleuselton: do you think we will have more variety of comps or strictly meta
[0:49:50] papitoresku: when is awc?

[0:50:02] Pluckyz: i agree
[0:50:04] NPBeharry: if you came back to AWC and went super sweat mode who would you play with

[0:50:32] dmason828: Would you ever leave the caster booth if you got an opportunity to compete again?
[0:50:37] DaraxBarex: i think wow arena is too daunting for new players or new audience to get into
[0:50:41] ALLtheEXP: @GrimlockMMO ayy the Grimlock himself
[0:50:44] zenseeker00: be nice if they didnt have to ban sub and they were just balanced bu t thats a hard ask
[0:50:47] figurines: You should only be able to play each spec once per match. Everyone flexes now. Lets actually make that a dynamic @venruki
[0:50:48] Cdenzy: severs up 3 hours before they said HUHH
[0:50:49] GrimlockMMO: @ALLtheEXP Wussup buddy :)

[0:52:23] chaps_86: very sadge
[0:52:25] hays4dayz: you don’t need someone to kick you. tooltip says shadow instead of nature now.
[0:52:27] GrimlockMMO: I think next week it will uncap.
[0:52:37] hays4dayz: it should be a different visual now too
[0:52:38] chaps_86: Everyone is fully geared this week....
[0:52:38] ZANEPVP: Venafro
[0:52:40] bigmancamx: @venruki are there boxes that I can buy?

[0:53:39] raisingbloodpressure: are there any notes
[0:53:51] wolfcy_94: it would have been unfair to just change the nature to arcane for mage for lore reasons, and not the warlock one tbh...
[0:53:55] nikthevoker: they dont care

[0:54:39] SirBeaverTeeth: when do they usually uncap
[0:54:44] cburo: oh shit, shifting power is now arcane school?!
[0:54:53] ohbingbong: all they need to do is hire 4 people just to focus pvp
[0:54:54] likeewlock: mid season they uncap

[0:55:40] seyvyur: it was 5/10. now its 7.5/15
[0:55:41] ahskrogue: Does that mean if you have 2 reversions up on the target via echo its 30% increased?
[0:55:42] Bombdiggity3315: the patch notes said it would become 20%
[0:55:52] nightmxz: pre 10.2.5 it was 5/10, the buff was 10/20 but they pre-nerfed KEKW
[0:55:55] Bombdiggity3315: @Sjemiell technically its a bit more than 30, but yes
[0:55:59] seyvyur: they didn't update the patch notes, they changed it on the ptr

[0:57:31] smexxt: Did they nerf rdruid?
[0:57:33] Innerverse: omg we can dragonfly everywhere too right?
[0:57:36] lokifenrir1: @venruki  try to fly with the soar

[1:00:00] johnnyquestz: the  Ven appeal is not which spec, its just your personality
[1:00:03] moremantella255: is fury supposed to be really good now or something?
[1:00:11] figurines: ONE HANDED FURY? lets go

[1:04:33] spoob37: spoob37 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[1:04:50] wavius: Whoa, did anyone else login and see everything replaced with, like, sprites? My graphics settings are fucked.
[1:04:53] sestren: I love how the spell school changes did basically nothing to melee, but absolutely suck for every caster rukiHmm
[1:05:02] buffevoker: Did they keep the talent 15 or 20% more?
[1:05:10] lokifenrir1: @venruki is the conquest cap gone yet?
[1:05:12] FreddoB: is that a warranted magechange
[1:05:34] dakotan517: @lokifenrir1 no
[1:05:41] aUNINGz: is fire breath on pets worth for heal?
[1:05:46] 서약님: Good morning beef steak, Sir ven.
[1:05:46] lokifenrir1: Damn
[1:05:49] maninthechair69: im 90% sure that boomkin is a legit bot but is normally healing

[1:10:40] Nightbot: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[1:11:27] nightmxz: I think the boomkin doesn't know how to play with an evoker, he's playing very defensive when prevoker can top from any health this early damp
[1:11:28] proneoz: does leech work in pvp if you get it on gear? or only from talents + enchants
[1:11:44] rekt1370: all leech works

[1:12:34] Jubite: prevoker fixed

[1:13:37] SweatyDaniels: wow you got it nerfed already
[1:14:08] kickboxer32xd: is conquest uncapped

[1:15:21] SirBeaverTeeth: @vepsee wasn't the ret patch that? x)
[1:15:21] Flappell: did you say they nerfed the new pres buffs?!
[1:15:24] pure__goat: Ven do you think its fair that dragon can just remove deathmark with no repercussions

[1:38:06] bump1: get that man caffeine
[1:38:08] heymomimonttv: @JestLaugh90 surv is good but not the best
[1:38:10] balsamolock: thx guys for your tips! you guys are awasome

[1:38:50] What_ln_Tarnation: i member
[1:38:50] Axtin: ill never understand why they made sprint +100% movement speed
[1:38:57] Troven2: Rogues literally just leave if they feel like they cant win lmao
[1:39:00] dipicat: this has been such a perfectly wonderful xpac for rogues. cloak immunity, 2 vanishes, gouge for every spec
[1:39:03] dipicat: oh my god i love being a rogue
[1:39:07] Kalakbar: we should go back to wod burst of speed
[1:39:08] crymorre: @Axtin it's actually crazy 246% speed in stealth with sprint
[1:39:10] rekt1370: gave so much shit to rogues that they didn't need and they still would be s tier LUL
[1:39:17] americanmoses18: MOAR BUFFS FERAL PWEESE
[1:39:18] What_ln_Tarnation: rogues get my vote for most cringe class in the game
[1:39:24] shoonerz: I might come back to retail wow if Rogue was removed from the game.
[1:39:25] dipicat: the rogue bias is unbelievably cringe at blizzard
[1:39:27] suclarberg: any insane buffs?
[1:39:28] kand1nsky: and no rogue even ask for it
[1:39:29] americanmoses18: @axtin approved buff feral
[1:39:30] magebrainx: i'm actually stunned and confused about conquest still being capped. i was certain they would do it
[1:39:31] Magottx: why did they ever just yolo give mages warrior and rogues 2 charges of mobility
[1:39:33] DBMezzy: damn i dont know why fury has that bladestorm talent in pvp rofl
[1:39:35] younotmytwin: What have you been doing for the start of this patch?

[1:39:49] Exitlifez: oh so thats while im sapped before i can even get a tyres off out the gate on blades edge
[1:39:51] DBMezzy: @zachgamegodx oh no jabait
[1:39:52] SteLawBro: I absolutely loved farming transmog when rogues could have 100% uptime on sprint.
[1:39:56] heymomimonttv: @magebrainx maybe after awc, but should def be coming soon since you can just about fully gear a new character now
[1:40:00] DBMezzy: PopNemo

[1:40:29] Varaben: I mean even without conquest cap you can still get basically full gear between the 1600 free item and the two free crafted pieces. I dunno why people complain about conquest cap.
[1:40:32] DBMezzy: @zachgamegodx bro chill no aggres
[1:40:36] suclarberg: you can dragon ride in the world now i think

[1:41:59] jamesip87: play death wish and keep pressing it
[1:42:07] Fury73: Look on your calendar
[1:42:09] Varaben: I wonder who the follower dungeons are really for? the gear from dungeons is so bad. I guess it’s just for brand new players?
[1:42:11] DBMezzy: fury so much less team oriented spec, deathwish on rbg can be fun
[1:42:12] rekt1370: death wish till you win the game
[1:42:12] dakotan517: is belt or neck usually a bigger upgrade for people?
[1:42:15] rekt1370: full send

[1:42:23] streetfultv: conquest cap removed?
[1:42:30] chaps_86: @dakotan517 I'd probably argue belt for maint stat

[2:21:23] InkdAdam: offensively bop u?
[2:21:25] krome2dadome: fire mage with no blink or alter or block KEKW
[2:21:34] jukeandnuke: how's spriest doing this patch? I've been gone for a while.
[2:21:59] shoonerz: Ven, you just gave up your secret Juutsu

[2:24:35] SokoLdOOb: warrior has only 1
[2:25:07] SokoLdOOb: warrior has only 1 adventage, mortal strike, thats why fury is so bad

[2:27:21] sourbutts: did indeed need heals
[2:27:22] krome2dadome: "heal me bro"
[2:27:22] grandmomm: the concept is to avoid u but if u stay back stacking htey will wait for you xD

[2:32:23] ItsBees: Supreme Pog
[2:32:28] SokoLdOOb: Clap

[2:32:29] Xolido: @NPBeharry ah ok
[2:32:35] Itankarenas: finally your healer did something
[2:32:37] Itankarenas: Kappa
[2:32:38] Kalakbar: it was so funny tho
[2:32:39] seyvyur: you owe the holy pally some mmr
[2:32:43] chrihorp: The poor holy pala gonna rage after being trolled
[2:32:51] ellisrainy: can u drop a marker if u havent already
[2:32:51] Kalakbar: give into your warrior instincts, flame the hpal in party chat
[2:32:51] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[2:32:57] ellisrainy: this is viddy material for sure LOL
[2:33:01] Badasti: sometimes a mans gotta do what a man does
[2:33:49] Kalakbar: oh ellis, when he "puts his toes in" you need to play clips of people getting swept out to sea
[2:34:59] MisterThatDude: EZ Clap
[2:35:29] seyvyur: both paladins ate it so you could play with deathwish
[2:35:38] Itankarenas: inb4 "fuck you"
[2:35:44] Dourme: plot twist it's crusader
[2:35:45] rockxtv: probably still a little fresh
[2:35:46] ellisrainy: @Kalakbar hahaha
[2:35:49] shamebadge: hates for forever x2
[2:35:50] Badasti: I bet playing some mage will cheer him right up
[2:35:55] ellisrainy: im gonna have fun with this 1 😂
[2:36:03] Kalakbar: hehe
[2:36:08] Mesmerized9879: could Crusader compete awc ?
[2:36:20] NPBeharry: no one would play with him
[2:36:22] Kalakbar: if he could find a team that could stand him, sure
[2:36:32] Badasti: @Mesmerized9879 since AWC is highly team based performance i doubt he'd get far
[2:36:35] Worgenator: quest mob hp is really bloated damn. Hard for some specs
[2:36:41] MisterThatDude: if anyone could stand playing with him yeah
[2:36:45] DaneDillon: Yeah... going to be hard to find team mates but technically possible.
[2:36:49] ItsBees: @Worgenator that's what the extra action button is for :D
[2:37:00] shoonerz: Who is Crusader?
[2:37:03] Worgenator: @ItsBees Oh, I know nothing of this patch haha
[2:37:05] skarny1: he could but hpal would need to be good as well, he doesnt play anything else
[2:37:05] Mesmerized9879: would be refreshing :D
[2:37:08] sourbutts: a 98% dampening game is crazy
[2:37:09] whitcomovich: He gets way too tilted to ever make it far in an actual tournament. You need to brush off losses and come back stronger.
[2:37:19] iloveyalunn: no...
[2:37:29] shamebadge: why would anyone want crusader to be in AWC? it's like pissing in the drinking pool
[2:37:30] MisterThatDude: nah not the way he talks to people
[2:37:31] tormyboo: skills are there teamplay prob not
[2:37:33] shamebadge: why poison it?
[2:37:35] fugginhiding: imagine the cam swapping to him mid scream
[2:37:53] PKGOD: @whitcomovich correct, and plus he would have to flex on other healers besides hpal.
[2:37:56] flames222: his people skills are as good as his form when he lifts weights lol
[2:37:57] iloveyalunn: LOL
[2:37:59] shoonerz: @whitcomovich have you watched JoeFernandes ? the dude does well but his attitude is wild haha. I love it
[2:38:04] SteLawBro: His mom comes in and kicks him out mid tournament.
[2:38:05] Badasti: blizzard gets triggered over the slightest controversy, nvm brinking that wrecking ball in
[2:38:10] Kalakbar: @flames222 flame of the century
[2:38:10] iloveyalunn: The cam would be peak content

[2:38:45] Mesmerized9879: @shamebadge when hpally is meta, it could add a chance to win
[2:38:46] swampbutt2000: BOC is fire
[2:38:52] AndroniusMaximus: YES i love fury warrior!
[2:38:59] AndroniusMaximus: so glad i caught this stream
[2:39:13] tniliesfahani: is conquest cap lifted?
[2:39:22] Badasti: @Mesmerized9879 there are plenty of amazing hpala players already in the awc though XD
[2:39:22] AndroniusMaximus: yes
[2:39:26] Itankarenas: i would
[2:39:29] Stoichulk: yes
[2:39:31] Itankarenas: free cleave
[2:39:32] roberxsillo: Why do you kill those elite mobs if they are not part of the quest ?
[2:39:34] AndroniusMaximus: are you running improved whirlwind?
[2:39:35] shoonerz: yeah, it adds a lot of cleave
[2:39:37] MisterThatDude: If you spec into the second whirlwind talent @venruki
[2:39:38] swampbutt2000: give us more BOC ven <3
[2:39:40] Smexxin: before rampages unless you're trying to burst in short windows
[2:39:46] dre_day_3k: Yooo
[2:39:56] MisterThatDude: Switch whirlwind with slam, slam does nothing
[2:40:05] Smexxin: also odyns gives you auto whirlwind when u press it
[2:40:18] Badasti: but he's the real slam shady
[2:40:21] AndroniusMaximus: odyns fury applies slaughterhouse now
[2:40:22] Itankarenas: test it on a dummy
[2:40:22] SteLawBro: Yea, youll know when youre trying to kill, then obv dont waste thhe global.
[2:40:25] Stoichulk: slam is good with this build
[2:40:26] AndroniusMaximus: fury is BACK
[2:40:32] randomsquigly: just rage dump with rampage
[2:40:35] krome2dadome: definitely press slam if ur talented for it
[2:40:35] MisterThatDude: whirlwind if specced fully into it will do more damage than slam
[2:40:38] MisterThatDude: single target
[2:40:38] dre_day_3k: what are we doing in pve?
[2:40:46] fugginhiding: top minds are saying
[2:40:58] Itankarenas: vaporized

[2:42:21] Badasti: warriors in general make the weirdest noises. I ahve no idea why blizzard decided they need to scream my head off all game
[2:42:22] Capitanii: @dre_day_3k they only changed the dodge talent thats on the same node as dampen harm
[2:42:37] tniliesfahani: why is scarlet crusade bad in 2023?  they need to have a redemption arc.  they are just misunderstood.
[2:43:02] ButtaTWD: where do you start questline?
[2:43:05] thedonmac: FortOne <3 DinoDance

[2:43:56] PKGOD: where do u start this
[2:44:12] stalecheetos: @PKGOD can find in suggested content in journal
[2:44:37] Varaben: Arthas did nothing wrong Kappa
[2:44:46] Badasti: yee
[2:44:50] tniliesfahani: fking Sylvie got redemption after all anything possible
[2:45:12] PKGOD: @stalecheetos nice thank u!
[2:45:27] sourbutts: feel free to give me as much constructive criticism chat
[2:45:33] Badasti: @venruki @Kalakbar I think the vod review bro got banned xd
[2:45:48] sourbutts: i got timed out for 10 seconds x
[2:46:04] Badasti: @sourbutts what mmr are you playing at?
[2:46:04] sourbutts: its because i linked armory its just automated
[2:46:12] DKgrips: anybody else experiencing a lot of addon fails?
[2:46:14] sourbutts: 1911 Cr
[2:46:16] jheas1: he doesnt make the rules lawl
[2:46:25] malvarcla: details is casuing tons of lua errors
[2:46:31] Dwilk20: They changed Elysian Decrease Color its green now not blue
[2:46:36] Keveldinho: how’s 10.2.5???
[2:47:04] dirtbagjimmy1021: what changed?
[2:47:10] vinsbarcelona: blizz no balance changes since 1 month ago
[2:47:14] bitcoinonlyfans: conquest still capped. rip
[2:47:29] bitcoinonlyfans: Fistweaver & prevoker gonna pop
[2:47:37] WardenDOTA: cant believe they actually changed soul rot to shadow
[2:47:38] Magottx: Feels so weird dragon riding in durotar
[2:47:41] Varaben: holiday y’all
[2:47:42] Galaxxius_Gaming: Did pres get buffed?
[2:47:45] Keveldinho: lol I guess. Im excited to try dragon riding flying in Azeroth. that was this patch right
[2:47:57] flames222: you would think they would roll out the balance changes to give awc players more time to practice comps
[2:48:17] sourbutts: i know i should play shimmer into casters more also, i am working on that
[2:48:20] Magottx: imagien coming from classic 20 min run to crossroad and someone dragonrides there in 5 sec
[2:48:35] Varaben: @flames222 I don’t think they’ve ever done that consistently
[2:48:59] tv_raz: theres your problem a shadow pirest is in the lobby
[2:49:09] sourbutts: sorry if quality is bad, i only ever recorded a game for ven
[2:49:19] sourbutts: i get shit on every round basically
[2:49:25] DrunkJoe14: HeyGuys
[2:49:43] Varaben: energized barrier
[2:49:50] sourbutts: yeah thats on my spec now actually

[2:50:38] bjak_: bjak_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Happy New Year! Any suggestions for 3s comps with dev evoker?
[2:50:41] sourbutts: im just bad lol
[2:50:57] Magottx: grey screen like he died already lol
[2:51:03] triiifinityproject: he has a perma fog debuff on his computer
[2:51:08] sourbutts: its my monitor, its actually fine on my screen
[2:51:17] bjak_: Nice! Thanks!
[2:51:27] ButtaTWD: destro dev has to be indane
[2:51:30] ButtaTWD: insane
[2:51:34] flyingorangee: @sourbutts NOTED but yee vod is like when you entered bastion in night KEKW
[2:51:46] sourbutts: i am sorry
[2:51:59] Zlipps: doing a lot of jumping around instead of apming
[2:52:21] hollow1zed: i think not playing shimmer is screwing him over hard here
[2:52:36] flyingorangee: @sourbutts dont be sorry for shit like that happens bro you sent it for gameplay not brightness KEKW
[2:52:51] sourbutts: i also am not using blizzard enough
[2:53:31] sourbutts: figured vs double priest wall just gets MD
[2:54:08] figurines: Why do you laugh at gladiatorlosa? At this point in weak auras and addons its actually smarter because it clears your eyes up to take in more info
[2:54:13] figurines: Mes weak aura the same thing
[2:54:35] sourbutts: priest dispells my ice floes to cancel my ray
[2:54:44] figurines: touche
[2:54:57] figurines: I did ask why. dont get defensive man.
[2:55:11] SteLawBro: ariW
[2:55:17] sourbutts: its ok you wont hurt my feelings
[2:55:24] sourbutts: you are top 3 mage all time
[2:55:32] Varaben: did he alter time either game?
[2:56:04] sourbutts: its because im running ice floes, and thers so many dispells
[2:56:11] sourbutts: i struggle vs shamans
[2:56:12] relaxed2care: that 2nd round i think positioning could be better . The monk had to extend himself to heal you, thus he was getting cced and kicked on cd
[2:56:57] murlu17: he used it first game
[2:57:00] Czechdubs: He used shifting first round
[2:57:01] ferahgok: he did after getting kicked on frost first game
[2:57:04] jukeandnuke: first round
[2:57:04] murlu17: x1
[2:57:14] Blitzylive: Ven did you try playing the resto evoker after buffs?
[2:57:16] sourbutts: i do use it, but im also stressing at this point in the game
[2:57:40] murlu17: as a chronic jumper myself, I feel like you're jumping a bit too much and losing total gcds possible
[2:57:52] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy ZacLemonator WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:58:11] zinisterzz: one of the games you had slow fall on so when you were jumping you were locking yourself from casting even longer lol
[2:58:16] sourbutts: yeah youre right
[2:58:26] sourbutts: i feel like i get flamed a lot for low dmg numbers
[2:58:53] Varaben: is he playing frost bomb?
[2:59:00] sourbutts: i love being target vs melee
[2:59:09] sourbutts: but i struggle vs casters, i think its shimmer
[2:59:49] ghostware9000: the shuff queues still fuckin insane?
[2:59:54] sourbutts: hey ven just wanna say thanks so much for doing this i really appreciate it
[2:59:55] Noirmist: what is frost bomb?
[2:59:58] jukeandnuke: been 5 months since I've played and I'm starting to get the itch...
[3:00:09] zachgamegodx: ven u just played withh pasha

[3:00:15] zachgamegodx: oh ur playing with him again
[3:00:36] zachgamegodx: bloodrage is insane vs mage
[3:00:38] zachgamegodx: esp frost
[3:00:41] zachgamegodx: it cancels ray
[3:00:49] nameyourform: can i be in a 1 shot video @Palumor
[3:00:54] zachgamegodx: mages cant ray fury
[3:01:42] animeintrovibes: yeah its so fun to go vs warriors also
[3:02:52] murlu17: lmao
[3:02:52] Moobot: Latest video "EVERYTHING NEW Coming In Patch 10.2.5 For World of Warcraft Dragonflight" view it here: youtu.be/_0UT1tK3q_g
[3:02:55] murlu17: those closed door clones
[3:02:56] aragarde: pain
[3:03:00] ghostware9000: he cloned 2 of your charges lol
[3:03:06] Bigvuqoffdam: rdruid's team is full health and disc priest getting double killed lol
[3:03:16] aragarde: /ignore
[3:03:46] aragarde: why did he dome early
[3:03:52] IIyena: nice dome
[3:04:23] aragarde: says crap, does crap
[3:04:28] aragarde: gotta love it

[3:07:36] krome2dadome: no uptime
[3:07:37] Stoichulk: CC
[3:07:38] Bigvuqoffdam: just kill the cat
[3:07:44] bwillyboy: frost mage kiting i think idk
[3:07:54] ghostware9000: yeah feral will flop
[3:07:58] AndroniusMaximus: youre getting cc'd by every ability XD
[3:08:20] animeintrovibes: yeah you always hear ferals crying about warriors
[3:08:30] Axtin: train this cat to the fucking ground and never even think about swapping
[3:08:34] Bigvuqoffdam: lmao @Axtin
[3:08:40] AndroniusMaximus: Its rough out there man i feel your pain.
[3:08:53] krome2dadome: fuck the cat NODDERS
[3:08:56] ghostware9000: they used everything on feral
[3:08:59] zachgamegodx: @Axtin why would u shit on that cats spot
[3:09:00] DaneDillon: Now look at that damage snupyPOG
[3:09:04] Bigvuqoffdam: @Axtin i sense some hostility breaking through...can you tell us how you really feel?
[3:09:06] ghostware9000: feral dies now
[3:09:32] Axtin: @Bigvuqoffdam dwarf rogue.
[3:09:37] Bigvuqoffdam: HHAHAH
[3:09:42] Bigvuqoffdam: two vanishes
[3:09:47] Bigvuqoffdam: dwarf
[3:09:49] Bigvuqoffdam: physical cloak
[3:10:12] iloveyalunn: I like the caster venruki commentary
[3:10:14] zachgamegodx: ven there's one more thing u can do into the mage, run death sentence along with blood rage and hold your execute procs as psuedo charge, makes you much stickier
[3:10:20] animeintrovibes: playing frost mage vs feral is a terrible experience
[3:10:23] Ultramagnus85: cyclone really needs a cooldown thats ridiculous
[3:10:29] rymerre: is that a real feral?
[3:10:31] zachgamegodx: just try it
[3:10:36] sourbutts: vs a bm hunter is also not fun
[3:10:39] yesterday_potato: details needs a fix driving me nuts
[3:10:50] wallstreet12345: Paint them red!
[3:12:11] ItsRahain: so whats the meta changes for 10.2.5?
[3:12:51] krome2dadome: @ItsRahain nothing really
[3:12:52] Tiazx1: All of these domes have been gamechanging
[3:13:17] mzaamentor: lol a mage main having the warrior experience
[3:13:24] ItsRahain: poggers ww still broken? Lets goooo maybe i hit glad
[3:13:28] sourbutts: are you casting the upcoming AWC?
[3:13:34] aragarde: lemmie done effed up
[3:13:50] InkdAdam: I know what you do…swap back arm’s because fury mid
[3:13:52] zachgamegodx: fury sucks, that's all we need to hear you say
[3:14:26] animeintrovibes: play outlaw rogue
[3:14:47] sourbutts: i think with a bm hunter going mage is fine
[3:15:50] Badasti: you need to screech in an angrier higher pitched voice to get on Joe's level
[3:16:10] kreyzy8: KEKW
[3:16:31] mzaamentor: LMAO
[3:16:34] mzaamentor: no shot
[3:16:35] krome2dadome: YAHOO!
[3:16:39] ghostware9000: cross kill but you lost??? wut
[3:16:49] Tiazx1: @ghostware9000 Both lose lol
[3:16:52] dakotan517: the new set from the new area is pretty dope
[3:16:52] ghostware9000: ohhhhh
[3:17:01] Badasti: did I miss the vod review btw?
[3:17:01] kreyzy8: yeah it just says you lost the round
[3:17:02] ItsRahain: everyone takes an L on cross kill
[3:17:11] ghostware9000: was gonna say it said you got an L
[3:17:13] Smexxin: :)
[3:17:13] mzaamentor: welcome to the club Ven
[3:17:15] dakotan517: it matches the watch perfectly
[3:17:16] AndroniusMaximus: :D
[3:17:17] shoqzix: @venruki can you show this seasons 2100 enchant
[3:17:19] krome2dadome: :)
[3:17:20] sourbutts: the two people who get the killing blows should get the win in a cross kill game imo
[3:17:24] wallstreet12345: New lobby new opportunities!
[3:17:27] Tiazx1: @smexxin
[3:17:29] Oreten710: there is a new area in game?
[3:17:31] Tiazx1: LUL
[3:17:43] dakotan517: @Oreten710 its the worgen zone
[3:17:44] Badasti: Ven validating all these filthy warriors
[3:17:45] krome2dadome: but ven.. warriors have too much mobility!
[3:17:49] gdodmebxu: barrier remove slow KEKW
[3:17:56] zachgamegodx: just slow them again
[3:17:56] mzaamentor: yep
[3:17:58] animeintrovibes: poor warrior ;(
[3:18:04] dakotan517: @krome2dadome lies
[3:18:06] Magottx: entire gnome racial
[3:18:08] ItsRahain: #NeverSlowedOutHereWhileYourTwoMilesPerHour
[3:18:13] Smexxin: :)
[3:18:13] dakotan517: we need more!
[3:18:18] sourbutts: the 25% movement speed from master shepherd plus energized barriers makes me feel like an arcane mage
[3:18:22] shoonerz: Playing against the mage rogue kit made me quit :(
[3:18:29] qirentv: hey guys, i would like to know what addons venruki uses out of curiosity mainly, does he show it somewhere?
[3:18:40] mzaamentor: LOL
[3:18:41] Magottx: yea and ff14 is way better.
[3:18:41] Volgi95: some people are insane
[3:18:44] kingceejay90: go utside @asdfghjknbvc
[3:18:47] dakotan517: what kinda boob makes a smurf twitch to cause dram
[3:18:48] ItsRahain: if @asdfghjknbvc Isn't a throw away account I don't know what is.
[3:18:50] kingceejay90: outside*
[3:18:51] blkylol: bro literally is on a burner
[3:18:53] Rocketglx: little gremlin lmao
[3:18:55] vmills: I’m sure this has been discussed but does anyone know which addons we have to turn off today? I am getting crazy errors today lol I think I seen someone say it was WA
[3:18:57] Banksy9813: hair is looking thicc
[3:18:58] wallstreet12345: One of the best streamers around. Great personality
[3:19:14] Tiazx1: @vmills omnibar aswell
[3:19:14] Rocketglx: peolple is weird
[3:19:18] McLarge: Hello Ven! How are you doing today?
[3:19:25] shoonerz: I like that i'm invisible in this chat.
[3:19:25] endtrip_: Kappa
[3:19:27] nameyourform: UR GONNA WHAT???
[3:19:29] McLarge: I'm doing great
[3:19:49] Badasti: @nameyourform he gonna pee... You gota fetish or smth? LUL
[3:20:03] mzaamentor: Do mages have too much mobility currently or it's fitting for the crazy gap closers added to all classes
[3:20:10] mzaamentor: what is your opinion guys
[3:20:32] MaybeRespect: 6 Blinks vs 2 charges, 2 grips, 2 rolls
[3:20:37] Badasti: @mzaamentor mages are made of paper and need mobility. If we had to tank melee 24/7 we'd be shadowpriests
[3:20:38] MaybeRespect: Hmmmm
[3:20:44] animeintrovibes: well if mages werent made of paper they wouldnt need so much mobility
[3:21:01] MaybeRespect: Yall crazy. Only fire is paper.
[3:21:07] animeintrovibes: cope
[3:21:15] mzaamentor: That's my opinion too but fuck if it isn't frustrating on a melee like arms lol
[3:21:18] azzkycker: paper with 10 layers of shields and absorbs
[3:21:21] Badasti: no it isnt. Mages have practically no armour, nomatter the spec
[3:21:26] nameyourform: he said hes gonna explode
[3:21:33] MaybeRespect: yeah bro arcane and frost die so easy. KEKW
[3:21:40] McLarge: So, remember how they changed the spell schools of The Hunt and Elysian Decree to be Chaos? Apparently, that doesn't make them scale with Mastery baseline. You still need Any Means Necessary to grant them Mastery scaling. Mvq tested it on stream on the PTR last night and confirmed. DH has gained 0 strength from the change
[3:21:49] dilsnick: dilsnick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[3:21:51] Badasti: @MaybeRespect remove blink from your bars and show us how long you last
[3:22:19] MaybeRespect: Who said to remove blink. It's the 6 charges of blink
[3:22:23] sourbutts: @Badasti so you mean play shadow priest?
[3:22:25] MaybeRespect: A bit overkill
[3:22:34] Badasti: @sourbutts according to this dude I guess XD
[3:22:35] mzaamentor: isn't sp really bad rn
[3:22:43] Badasti: shadowpriests have passive reduction that mages dont have though
[3:22:45] animeintrovibes: what 6 charges of blink are you talking about tho
[3:22:57] mzaamentor: I counted 4
[3:23:03] MaybeRespect: Ven legit just said going on frost is probably bad idea.
[3:23:08] MaybeRespect: Saying to play in their face.
[3:23:13] robfrmamzn: ratJAM
[3:23:22] sourbutts: @mzaamentor yes
[3:23:24] Badasti: yeah as a warrior, you arent meant to counter everything on earth as a warrior
[3:23:37] mzaamentor: no shit, mages always been our counter
[3:23:53] McLarge: @mzaamentor People say it's bad, but they really mean that it's clunky and unfun. Wizk and Pokemons are capable of 200K DPS on SP. And I know, one is the best SP ever and the other bots, but it shows that the spec is capable of it
[3:23:57] AndroniusMaximus: Is the hunt op now that its chaos or is it okay?
[3:24:01] sourbutts: theres blink, displace (which is dispellable) alter time usage resets blink (also dispellable) and thats all of them
[3:24:16] animeintrovibes: melee just want people to be target dummies
[3:24:27] mzaamentor: That'd be nice
[3:24:30] MaybeRespect: @sourbutts Cope
[3:24:40] mzaamentor: if you can just stop moving for a second brother, let me just bladestorm
[3:24:43] sourbutts: @McLarge wizk is different gravy, i saw him md a clone on himself at awc
[3:25:08] sourbutts: @MaybeRespect no, saying mages have 6 blinks is copium bro, learn how to not stun on your first charge
[3:25:11] McLarge: @AndroniusMaximus Nothing changed with DH. Those abilities being Chaos did not grant them Mastery scaling without Any Means Necessary. Mvq tested it on the PTR on stream last night and confirmed
[3:25:23] sourbutts: @mzaamentor hahah unreal
[3:25:30] MaybeRespect: @sourbutts I don't play war. But they do, unless vs Sham or other mage spamming dispell
[3:25:39] mzaamentor: lmao
[3:26:12] MaybeRespect: Wild to me people thinking arcane is easy to kill.
[3:26:29] gaberzorz: ven whats that addon you got that changes the color of nameplates like banner and totems?
[3:26:34] McLarge: You and I agree on a lot more than you realize, Ven.
[3:26:37] sourbutts: @MaybeRespect every class has a hard counter bro, mages just so happened to hard counter warriors
[3:26:40] gaberzorz: !totems
[3:26:40] Nightbot: The Weakaura for my totems/pets is Teea Nameplate Totems
[3:26:53] gaberzorz: thank you
[3:26:57] MaybeRespect: @sourbutts How many times you gonna bring up war. I never mentioned war.
[3:27:04] McLarge: That's my fault though, I have a habit of only pointing out the things I disagree with
[3:27:07] nameyourform: mage lock
[3:27:12] Ey_an: rogue
[3:27:14] flames222: dk?
[3:27:14] mzaamentor: fury is bottom tier isn't it
[3:27:19] nameyourform: yeah rogue lmfao
[3:27:20] ihavesmokedcrack: Fury owns healers
[3:27:22] chervz: ele?
[3:27:22] robfrmamzn: dk
[3:27:24] McLarge: Anything Fury counters, Arms counters just as effectively
[3:27:24] MaybeRespect: War - prob DK
[3:27:28] mrxilio: not sure much counters rogue if its a high xp rogue
[3:27:34] sourbutts: @MaybeRespect hes playing warrior rn, thats why this conversation started.
[3:27:48] AndroniusMaximus: Yes
[3:27:48] ihavesmokedcrack: in 1v1 fury beats most melee
[3:27:50] mzaamentor: ya fury is just the worse arms but my god is arms boring to play rn.... I might give fury a shot ngl
[3:27:50] nameyourform: in the words of Cdew. Rogue counters warrior because rogue counters every class
[3:27:57] sourbutts: @mrxilio dh is pretty good into rogue id say
[3:28:04] MaybeRespect: @sourbutts Ight bro arcane/frost trash easy targets your right. Not gonna argue
[3:28:11] McLarge: Slam is a Rage generator on Fury btw @venruki
[3:28:27] sourbutts: @MaybeRespect nobody said that
[3:28:29] McLarge: But it's a spender on Arms
[3:28:31] mrxilio: @sourbutts true.. prolly best chance. just think rogue is still a step above at top levels.
[3:28:51] MaybeRespect: Eh just people saying arcane and frost are made of paper.
[3:29:10] Zeniticon: fire is made of paper
[3:29:16] MaybeRespect: Fire is. Def.
[3:29:17] Czechdubs: Feral is made of flash paper :)
[3:29:19] mzaamentor: I one tap my friend's frost mage the second I connect to him with my WW monk lol
[3:29:24] mzaamentor: is he just bad then?
[3:29:25] mrxilio: nah mage has kevlar under those robes haha
[3:29:31] Axtin: theyre made of paper but theyre covered in dish soap
[3:29:31] iloveyalunn: Pretty sure kubzy is impossible to kill on arcane mage
[3:29:32] aragarde: i only like the top hat
[3:29:41] aragarde: comes with monocle
[3:29:43] MaybeRespect: That's Dope!
[3:29:54] Notty21: do you have the diamond tipped cane weapon xmog?
[3:29:55] Lleo00: very posh
[3:29:58] turbonerd1185: I'm rockin that look on my gnome
[3:30:07] McLarge: Mages are made of paper if you can connect. But Mage mobility outclasses literally everything else in the game and the only things that can stick on them are things that either ignore their anti-mobility or have tons of anti-mobility themselves
[3:30:10] Badasti: was in shuffle, nice misquote. People said mages are made of paper without their mobility
[3:30:10] Blitzylive: archeology
[3:30:12] Lleo00: outland cup
[3:30:15] matt_caste: The fox mount textures lack solid definition, it becomes a bit of a blob when not viewed up close, kind of suffering from the same thing the glowy mounts from the end of SLs had
[3:30:18] Zeniticon: follower dungeons
[3:30:19] sourbutts: try and stand still and take damage as a mage and tell me youre tanky, they are very good at avoiding damage though.
[3:30:22] Lleo00: fly ur dragon in azeroth
[3:30:23] aragarde: archivist quest in azure span
[3:30:24] Lleo00: bout it i think
[3:30:38] wicked_wizurd: new nelf city/village thing
[3:30:40] Blitzylive: its a very sad patch
[3:30:40] mzaamentor: wait you're in gilneas, wtf
[3:30:56] Lleo00: idk why they reduced the fly speed to 85% in azeroth
[3:31:06] MaybeRespect: @sourbutts Haha what class can AFK tank dmg
[3:31:11] Abruty: Have you tried SOD ?
[3:31:14] harrisponge: LMAOOO
[3:31:14] MaybeRespect: DMG is insane atm.
[3:31:21] nikthevoker: @venruki details is updated
[3:31:22] harrisponge: why u do ole boy like that
[3:31:31] sourbutts: @MaybeRespect nobody said afk, i said stand still, which would be most classes
[3:32:02] DeityRevert: my details just updated too
[3:32:06] 서약님: sir ven don’t like Eggs Benedict?
[3:32:11] jheas1: shadow priest run out to the middle and stand there
[3:32:23] nikthevoker: goddamit comcast being comcast LUL
[3:32:26] Lleo00: feel like i just implode if a hunter looks in my general direction on mage
[3:32:28] nameyourform: spriest just cant kite well at all lmfao
[3:32:29] Lleo00: esp fire
[3:32:37] PapiGibs: what a combo lol
[3:32:38] SteLawBro: And then when you finally get to a mage and get them low...They reverse time back to full. 😐
[3:32:41] PapiGibs: what kind of fish
[3:32:46] sourbutts: @Lleo00 bro if hes bm and his pet looks at you, you're 50%
[3:32:47] mzaamentor: should they add mobility to sp? Spectral guise come back?
[3:32:48] primejusticegaming: yooo ven
[3:32:49] Buleh: Why not put fish in cereal?
[3:32:52] McLarge: Idk if you saw me say it Ven, but DH gained no strength or Talent point flexibility from the spell school change to The Hunt and Elysian Decree. They didn't gain Mastery scaling baseline. Something about the way Any Means Necessary works has those spells listed specifically as things to modify

[3:33:00] MaybeRespect: @sourbutts what is nova
[3:33:23] myodoctor: how’s fury buffs
[3:33:36] Ultramagnus85: true it is obnoxious
[3:33:41] mzaamentor: yeah it is
[3:33:43] ooPickleRicKoo: epic song
[3:33:46] sourbutts: @MaybeRespect lol bro, go duel a bm hunter as mage, let me know how that nova works out for you
[3:33:52] Zeniticon: how about shadowmeld ?
[3:33:55] McLarge: I just want my Focus target to not disappear due to stealth
[3:33:56] mzaamentor: I bolted a totem over Feign death once, ultimate mad
[3:33:56] primejusticegaming: FD is toxic
[3:33:56] MaybeRespect: @sourbutts Duels?
[3:34:00] DeityRevert: they just updated the text apparently because when you drop AMN it lowers the dmg of decree/hunt...
[3:34:06] matt_caste: The amount of times I've had a hunter feign at the exact same time I hit a big dmg CD and it just auto targets a pet instead
[3:34:12] Ultramagnus85: damn shadowmeld
[3:34:14] wreckedgum: spectral guise is for priests?
[3:34:15] sourbutts: @MaybeRespect basically 2v2
[3:34:24] McLarge: It's so annoying to have to reassign a Focus target in the middle of the match if I want to keep an eye on a RDruid for example
[3:34:32] primejusticegaming: nothing is worse than sending a  bolt, hoj, kidney into a pet cause a hunter FD
[3:34:33] Abruty: it even bugs out nameplates sometimes lol
[3:34:43] Ultramagnus85: yea I just wish it didnt make me lose focus target
[3:34:56] mzaamentor: if you FD'd into turtle back in BFA, the turtle wouldn't even show
[3:34:57] mzaamentor: rofl
[3:35:21] mouro52: Is fury good for pvp atm?
[3:35:24] arcane_p: is warrior more fun than DH for you Ben?
[3:35:25] mouro52: or is it still a pve spec?
[3:35:25] McLarge: I don't like how Fury is incentivized to attack just one target
[3:35:28] arcane_p: ven*?
[3:35:31] Axtin: fury warr is probably way more fun with a paladin
[3:35:40] 서약님: sir ven’s fury
[3:35:41] sourbutts: i love theres hunters with FD bot's that FD so fast Ray of Frost doesnt even show as a casted spell on details
[3:35:47] Buleh: Commercial volume is like 4x louder than stream volume
[3:36:29] arcane_p: they supposedly made broadcasting commercials louder than the actual program illegal in the US
[3:36:35] McLarge: How does Fury feel in terms of strength, Ven? From what I've seen, it seems like it's good just not better than Arms
[3:36:37] mzaamentor: a FD bot, wtf
[3:36:40] sourbutts: just got into a solo shuffle on my frost mage and its, arcane mage, fire mage and outlaw rogue lol
[3:36:41] arcane_p: it was a huge problem
[3:36:41] mzaamentor: that's foul
[3:36:50] daddyguldan: would it be worth to stream wow in 2024 as a new streamer
[3:37:11] OdysseyOG: fury is pve and arms is pvp
[3:37:12] McLarge: Interesting.
[3:37:21] pvalue01: yeah fury can def pump
[3:37:25] mzaamentor: I think fury has more one shot potential?
[3:37:26] arcane_p: your gnome actually looks cool though
[3:37:26] nameyourform: Means hes better at fury
[3:37:27] Notty21: fury allows you have two of the best looking two hander in the game thought
[3:37:27] McLarge: What matchups did you notice that in?
[3:37:28] Zeniticon: you got more mobillity as fury if i remember correctly
[3:37:30] mvpJ_: what are the pros/cons of arms vs fury?
[3:37:37] zachgamegodx: absurd?
[3:37:40] zachgamegodx: its ok
[3:37:49] B0ost3d: Ive been having so much fun in bg blitz gearing up alts
[3:37:53] zachgamegodx: well then arcane does absurd dmg all the time lol
[3:37:55] zachgamegodx: and dev
[3:37:58] zachgamegodx: and destro
[3:38:02] McLarge: They do
[3:38:19] zachgamegodx: so why the heck would u ever play fury when it conditionally does absurd dmgh
[3:38:20] McLarge: Damage is really high across the board
[3:38:24] gdodmebxu: @zachgamegodx play those classes KEKW
[3:38:28] mzaamentor: also I heard the MS from Fury gets overwritten by weaker version of other classes, which is a problem. That true?
[3:38:31] zachgamegodx: i do
[3:38:33] ghostware9000: shiba dog
[3:38:35] zachgamegodx: f furry
[3:38:46] NozakGaming: lots of cool breads that like cold weather
[3:38:54] wallstreet12345: Repair!
[3:39:02] McLarge: @mzaamentor Slaughterhouse has to stack. At low stacks, it will get overwritten by weaker MS effects. At high stacks, it will not be overwritten though
[3:39:13] Blitzylive: alright evoker time!
[3:39:15] mzaamentor: oh ok
[3:39:19] Hoodwinkel: [Infurious Warboots of Impunity |A:Professions-ChatIcon-Quality-Tier4:17:17::1|a]
[3:39:36] seaent: test them reversion buffs
[3:39:53] seaent: wtf
[3:40:22] McLarge: Has anyone tested Echoing Reprimand btw? Changing from Arcane to Physical and then getting buffed by 43% should make it one shot cloth wearers
[3:40:24] pvalue01: eu being meta slaves like usual
[3:40:28] mzaamentor: I really wanna try fury
[3:40:33] B0ost3d: i had an old Cd back in the early 2000s called Pulse that had all the good old songs on it like this. i just found it on spotify ty
[3:40:35] nikthevoker: LFG very dead LUL
[3:40:41] drdoomkinx: because EU people like eevery game to go 12min
[3:40:54] mzaamentor: Have you ever thought about doing Death Wish, cheese one shots Ven?
[3:40:59] nikthevoker: dont forget to repair
[3:41:10] mzaamentor: lmao
[3:41:10] ooPickleRicKoo: so is fury good now?
[3:41:20] nikthevoker: was it fun ttho
[3:41:29] zachgamegodx: @iPickleRickq worst spec in the game imo
[3:41:31] Zeniticon: dearth wish is fun on low ratings
[3:41:34] Puffeynick: guys why did venruki lie to me? he said the CONQ cap would be lfited today
[3:41:35] zachgamegodx: for dps
[3:42:07] mzaamentor: damn it's the paladin song
[3:42:09] ooPickleRicKoo: @Puffeynick I was disappointed as well.. I bought wrong pieces of gear with my conquest and I am behind
[3:42:16] mzaamentor: you're powering up that ret
[3:42:43] Puffeynick: @Puffeynick  or unde Sadge
[3:42:48] wallstreet12345: What is that bursyt
[3:42:48] Koraszdormu: Venrageki!  What;s good, Ven.  How you doing today brother?
[3:43:04] Zeniticon: you hoped for it
[3:43:04] Puffeynick: in my dreams
[3:43:17] drdoomkinx: idk how its not lifted this late into the season....
[3:44:10] Lleo00: i got a char lvl 70 last tuesday and im only wearing 3 honor pieces currently
[3:44:12] Puffeynick: @Puffeynick sry my msg got cut off somehow. I meant to say that as BM hunter i currently have over  percent crit. and top ranked ones barely have 20, itotally fffed up Sadge
[3:44:16] AndroniusMaximus: yo the new jade stomp looks kinda hard
[3:44:17] shoonerz: PepePls
[3:44:21] Lleo00: with the hellbloom and 3 free pieces u should be able to get full gear nearly
[3:44:26] Puffeynick: over 30
[3:44:34] ooPickleRicKoo: jade stomp is so cool dude
[3:44:56] Puffeynick: @iPickleRickq what do you play?
[3:44:59] shoonerz: three free peices? you mean the ones you have to farm flight stones for?
[3:45:26] mzaamentor: @iPickleRickq the new animations are sick
[3:45:31] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[3:45:31] wallstreet12345: clutch
[3:45:48] ooPickleRicKoo: @Puffeynick I play healer mainly resto shaman
[3:45:52] mzaamentor: LOL
[3:45:59] rivellana: little kid with a stick on mustache
[3:46:03] murcury44: dragon riding anywhere is dope tho
[3:46:10] TooOldForThis__: As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
[3:46:18] Puffeynick: @Puffeynick stacked the wrong stat? same on my hunter, i stacked crit and its worthless so sad
[3:46:58] Nachofez: that build looks clunky to play
[3:47:02] robfrmamzn: we've been spending most our lives living a mages paradise
[3:47:09] ooPickleRicKoo: @Puffeynick I basically don't have enough mastery and it sucks not having enough mastery when you get to 60% dampening
[3:47:30] Faintestedge: the weird al parody of this, "amish paradise," is one of my favorites of his
[3:47:33] Lleo00: @shoonerz no you get 2 crafted tokens from like first arena game or w/e and a main piece from hitting 1600
[3:47:45] shoonerz: Ah, okay
[3:47:48] ooPickleRicKoo: like I should have crafted a ring.. my shoulder has wrong stats etc..
[3:47:51] Puffeynick: @Puffeynick same mastery is my main stat as bm and was going for crit all along, i play arenas
[3:48:16] Lleo00: the hellbloom stuff tho you gotta farm trophies of strife and  bloody tokens which can be a pain
[3:48:32] zenseeker00: lol yall suck @Puffeynick  @iPickleRickq
[3:48:35] wallstreet12345: Kite king
[3:48:40] mzaamentor: nice one
[3:48:42] Smexxin: gnomobility with the kites PogChamp
[3:49:13] Itankarenas: hellbloom was good, but with how high conq is rn you dont need it anymore really. maybe like 1-2 pieces
[3:49:20] ooPickleRicKoo: @Lleo00 yeah I need the hellbloom shoulder piece.. not sure how I am going to farm blood tokens lol
[3:49:23] Ey_an: i play dk i dunno what ur talking about
[3:49:24] Itankarenas: cloak and bracer at most i would think
[3:49:48] Puffeynick: @zenseeker00 stop it or oi will report you to my mom
[3:49:51] Itankarenas: @iPickleRickq you do the trophy weekly and pray you get token world quests each day
[3:49:52] Lleo00: @iPickleRickq look for the pvp world quests, theres a big one in ohnaran that gives like 500 or something, and normal pvp quests give 50 default
[3:49:55] AndroniusMaximus: Fury is great when you have full uptime.
[3:50:00] Lleo00: you can get single ones from murdering ppl in the world
[3:50:19] Itankarenas: @AndroniusMaximus that's any class tho LUL
[3:50:31] FinkleTheMage: RETURN OF THE MAC
[3:50:34] FinkleTheMage: YOU LIEEEEEED TO MEEEE
[3:50:44] Lamatastisch: is conquest uncapped now?
[3:50:49] Itankarenas: @Lamatastisch no
[3:51:02] Itankarenas: 6.3k cap
[3:51:06] Lamatastisch: Sadge
[3:51:37] Dalok: D:
[3:51:37] AndroniusMaximus: @Itankarenas yea but its different. Cause you cant really control your uptime as much on fury.
[3:52:29] frazzoqt: Did they remove conq cap future bois?
[3:52:41] Itankarenas: im in 2025 rn. still capped
[3:53:11] Wowbolts: I’m in 2026. still capped
[3:53:19] jporter_: the new faeline stomp animation is awesome
[3:54:15] Lamatastisch: I went back in time to SL 2023, its uncapped here
[3:55:22] frazzoqt: Ty for the info from the future, you may proceed
[3:55:31] Itankarenas: imagine being able to time travel and going back to SL DansGame
[3:55:54] mzaamentor: time travel to 2025 for gta v
[3:55:59] mzaamentor: vi*
[3:56:09] gelatokush: we cant travel in times backwards yet only forward
[3:56:09] Itankarenas: 2035*
[3:56:16] likeewlock: DF release was nov 2022

[3:58:19] ch4osp4nda: @venruki dude, your triple envoker vid is the best ive watched in a long time. It really puts me in a good mood
[3:58:22] majacobosrs: I think furry is more fun than arms but that's my opinion
[3:58:25] McLarge: Idk if it's necessarily squishy, but Enraged Regen is definitely weaker than Die by the Sword
[3:58:31] Hoodwinkel: sp locks are fun
[3:58:46] sourbutts: @McLarge what about in a caster lobby?
[3:58:50] mzaamentor: Do you like WW rn Ven?
[3:58:52] Notty21: whats your presevoker shuffle ranking up to?
[3:59:25] zachgamegodx: it hink you need a new chant tho
[3:59:30] zachgamegodx: did u check nunruki
[3:59:43] McLarge: @sourbutts In that case, Enraged Regen is technically better because it's secondary effect functions. But Arms still has Ignore Pain so Idk if it's a great comparison
[3:59:51] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: What up Ven
[4:00:14] mzaamentor: LMAO
[4:00:16] frazzoqt: What classes would pair best with a hpala for 3s, dev/dh/bomy/lock

[4:22:33] Tim_Bmx_2017: ggs venruki i was that monk i had to go tryhard to show im not bad
[4:22:39] Orpheaus1: @supatease They did so many of these shit nerfs just to make things "Thematically correct" mage shifting going arcane, aff lock soul rot going shadow etc.
[4:23:43] Orpheaus1: I swear they didn't even put a second thought into how damaging it would be for those classes in PvP
[4:23:55] drdoomkinx: @supatease do you know any Devs that can look into balance druid 4set not worknig with incarnation?

[4:38:29] Reiumi_: monkaW
[4:38:47] Abruty: I just tried playing a solo shuffle, and yeah I came to the conclusion that I just enjoy watching people play it
[4:39:12] lad1da: @Abruty maybe you could try a thousand games and see whats up
[4:39:20] lad1da: rounds*
[4:39:39] VinbreezyTV: is pvp still active enough to return to retail at top of the eu ladder? Anyone knows?
[4:39:41] Abruty: problem with that is the waiting time
[4:39:55] ziloclol: why no pre cast the tyr then? :o
[4:39:59] lad1da: @Abruty just watch venruki meanwhile
[4:40:08] lad1da: or camp rare spawns
[4:40:22] lad1da: pvp in wow has a high entry skill level
[4:40:38] psychic241: gotta love when neither of ur dps kick ray or frost bomb
[4:40:46] LarseNms: @lad1da :-)
[4:40:56] lad1da: @LarseNms yeah u know
[4:41:40] nameyourform: i dont understand average wait time for ques lmfao, do they just guess? 21 mins average. in que 56mins
[4:41:55] theodeth: Can you shifting power?
[4:41:57] Lydiayang: i swear it's the distance between pillars on this map. ppl thing they are safe playing opposite pillars but it's actually out of range for the healer
[4:41:58] LarseNms: "average"
[4:42:02] LarseNms: FeelsDankMan
[4:42:05] morrs: I don't think I am even close to your knowledge - I noticed that sometimes when they cast cc near you, you don't rebuke. Any resons?
[4:42:33] lad1da: @nameyourform no healers queing up so ur just unlucky
[4:42:46] Abruty: I actually wish we could Q in retail while playing other version like SOD atm (and w/o paying for a second account)
[4:42:48] HatedHero_Uttress: 1 team waits 40 minutes, 2nd team gets instant queue. 20 minute average. lol
[4:43:03] morrs: got it
[4:43:04] flames222: also not usually worth making plays in solo as a healer
[4:43:22] astrry: supernova for batman?
[4:44:16] lad1da: @nameyourform whats ur solo rating if i may ask
[4:47:08] nameyourform: 2300
[4:47:26] morrs: I like how the priest play and ofc your play too
[4:47:39] lad1da: @nameyourform i suspect average player that is decent is around 1800 so thats prolly where most healers are if im not stupid af
[4:47:54] lad1da: ur just suffering from success, unlucky.
[4:49:49] CoAco95: its crazy how many times you get kicked every round LuL

[4:50:36] Abruty: Ven, what do you think about being able to have classic and retail playable at the same time. There would be more people playing, Queues would be less of a pain IMO

[4:51:17] Swingingwilly: makes sense to be arcane tho
[4:51:27] Abruty: money money money
[4:51:30] 2dgirlisallineedtell3dcya: doesnt matter too much with infinite mobility
[4:51:39] drumminbacon: @Swingingwilly agreed. the time manipulation aspect off CDR fits arcane

[5:23:55] Zeniticon: on dps
[5:24:01] Rothon54: i can honestly say i've never played enough to hit a wall, but always stop at 1800ish hahah... if i don't try pushing can't fail ya kno even with a 70%+ win rate in solos.
[5:24:02] Zeniticon: and play healer the rest of the time
[5:24:08] Yoseirl: i get full honor and stop usially
[5:24:27] zerx_gg: its not ranked on how strong it is, but rather popularity @spacemanwx
[5:24:28] aaggros: the games getting really sweaty after 2200
[5:24:29] Pitchbas: Wait are you in double queue? :D
[5:24:38] Reiumi_: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[5:25:13] Zeniticon: they should add incremental gains from 1800 +
[5:25:35] e10100111001: bruh, easy on him
[5:25:37] DaraxBarex: i think 1800 is fine enough rating. It keeps enough players engaged in PvP since the casuals will be majority of the playerbase and they can push for it
[5:26:24] tarth_100: You should look at the rating distribution for normal 3s too
[5:26:43] swilly07: are the instants just holy shock and wog?
[5:28:27] tarth_100: Are you not playing 4 set on pally?
[5:28:45] Mhortai: @tarth_100 4 set is bugged atm
[5:28:58] tarth_100: oh dang
[5:28:59] spacemanwx: @zerx_gg Ohh i see. Thanks
[5:29:10] tarth_100: @Mhortai how? like it doesn't work at all?
[5:29:17] Selyn5705: Young Volo - MYSTERY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMwGtNPahb4
[5:29:33] xkayne: lol crap.. when did this pally play happen
[5:29:35] Mhortai: @tarth_100 Nvm he is holy ignore what I said. 4 set for ret is bugged not holy lol
[5:29:47] tarth_100: lol nw
[5:29:55] sourbutts: theres roughly 13000 more people on the ladder in NA than EU, interesting
[5:30:11] tarth_100: ah hes using it, its just 7 sec off daybreak instead of 15
[5:30:15] Infidel_Tech: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening ladies and gentlemen - Supa
[5:30:23] Mhortai: @sourbutts EU players (top players anyway) are also playing on NA right now. At least some.
[5:31:21] e10100111001: eh you're owning
[5:31:29] SpectralSkull: <3
[5:31:29] sourbutts: @Mhortai i wish wow was big in korea so we could see a different meta like they have in league of legends
[5:32:28] soddi: so annoying if the opening clone isn't countered by one of the mates with a range kick
[5:33:40] spacemanwx: you were the powerhouse

[5:34:11] yesterday_potato: same with rdrtuid
[5:34:28] Silentsmh: @yesterday_potato ?
[5:34:41] yesterday_potato: scares me when tunneled
[5:34:50] tarth_100: dude, its so hard to survive dk openers w/o bubble on hpal, makes me sad
[5:34:56] Silentsmh: rdruid laughs at u while in bear form cycloneing ur team
[5:34:56] brayonl0pes: Could anyone here recreate an item for me?  call PV
[5:35:03] Blitzylive: warrior owns
[5:35:11] tarth_100: wall, auramastery, daybreak, hand of devinity
[5:35:13] yesterday_potato: i get laughed at
[5:35:16] bigpapafood: disgusting
[5:35:16] DaraxBarex: damn wtf
[5:35:18] tarth_100: die through all of it and still have to bubble
[5:35:20] rymerre: mortal strike + necrotic
[5:35:23] yesterday_potato: while stunned in trabel form
[5:35:31] purkey01: did you get glad last szn?
[5:35:35] Silentsmh: skill issue
[5:35:42] Silentsmh: rdruid is so overtuned my man
[5:36:00] NPBeharry: pretty sure he gets r1 every season @purkey01
[5:36:06] tarth_100: I think pally is just easy to kill, i swear I can never die to DK opener on rsham or disc
[5:36:16] NPBeharry: all they need to do is get rid of treants @silentsmh
[5:36:21] NPBeharry: or nerf it significantly
[5:36:31] purkey01: talking about 3’s? not shuffle
[5:36:38] Silentsmh: yea trents is like healing totem on steroids
[5:36:39] NPBeharry: yeah 3s
[5:36:40] Extramediums: I queued one game on my resto sham, in honor gear, in RSS. I haven't played resto since wrath. The first game I played at 0cr was vs a glad warrior that did 3x more damage than any one else and won every game by tunneling either healer all game
[5:36:51] GoodyQQ: i hope we see destro WLD in next tourny
[5:37:09] NPBeharry: I’m expecting to see some mld
[5:37:27] NPBeharry: seems good into rogue boomy
[5:37:30] Varaben: Cheer100 check out twitch rpg for free bits rukiBlankie
[5:38:01] Mhortai: @Varaben I get all kinds of bits from that lol
[5:38:07] Mhortai: Being I play pally so much, I want to try healing again and have played Holy Paladin back in OG wrath. @venruki your feedback on Holy might make we switch one of my alt Ret Pallies to holy.
[5:38:20] zerx_gg: time to look up the warrior
[5:38:31] meckolele: ohhh you have a new patch  10.2.5 vid on yt, will check it out now
[5:38:32] gottix77: how does the new divinetoll looklike?
[5:38:37] Blitzylive: Ven trying to sell healing classes to get more healers in game haha!
[5:38:41] Silentsmh: the warrior is magnus
[5:39:01] Varaben: @blitzylive rukiGrin rukiGrin rukiGrin
[5:39:10] Extramediums: @havenblood I queued a few after that last night, and it wasn't much better. If memory serves it started me at 1600mmr
[5:39:22] Schwantes2: its not for everyone
[5:39:31] suhnu: you should make like a summary vid of ur experience with each healer now that u played all
[5:39:32] Blitzylive: Blizz needs to implement a mechant with LOS healers first
[5:39:44] Blitzylive: so people don't LOS my heals
[5:39:49] zerx_gg: we need ven in his techno era
[5:39:53] SpectralSkull: Recently hit 70 on disc and its been more fun than all my dps classes
[5:40:18] zerx_gg: Pog
[5:40:27] Mhortai: @SpectralSkull I have always enjoyed disc honestly. I just NEVER play my priest lol
[5:40:31] Extramediums: healing is much more fun when you're not playing with the people who have never broke 1600 until hopping on an op meta class and doesn't understand CD's, los, or range
[5:40:36] zerx_gg: im in my hard techno era, idk man gets me pumpin during runs
[5:40:39] SpectralSkull: Reckful playlist is best playlist
[5:40:43] Silentsmh: that warrior is a bot
[5:40:47] Silentsmh: 99% win rate
[5:40:47] DaraxBarex: i feel like i dont have enough patience as a healer lol
[5:40:52] SteLawBro: Thats why WoW's so daunting to new players. Good luck feeling competitve for like 2-3 years...At least.
[5:41:07] zerx_gg: its why wow is a 90% pve game
[5:41:25] DaraxBarex: @SteLawBro sad truth. WoW PvP just can't attract new players
[5:41:28] dprims8: how do u ghet a fat LoH
[5:41:32] dprims8: my LoH are always shirt
[5:41:32] Taevenx: 25% damp LOH mega OP
[5:41:43] Silentsmh: 259 out of 261 games played won from that warrior lol
[5:41:48] Mhortai: @zerx_gg I mean sure, PvP also has never gotten any real attention from Blizz to attract people to it.
[5:41:48] Silentsmh: aint no way hes not botting
[5:42:01] zerx_gg: and it wont, cause its 10% of the player base
[5:42:08] Mhortai: PvP has barely changed since TBC lol
[5:42:23] zerx_gg: its the same on most mmo's
[5:42:43] DaraxBarex: @Mhortai i think it has gotten better for veteran players but worse for newer players
[5:43:05] Extramediums: PVP has changed quite a bit, but the underlying concepts are still there, it's too bad that they've not treated it with respect or attention and it fell off after wrath for the most part.
[5:43:08] Tiebot87: @venruki Hey!  So they were suppse to nerf DHs? changed Hunt to chaos dmg which is now effected by mastery? so really they got buffed?  lol
[5:43:43] chrye_xx: the amount of double DH lobbies I’ve seen this whole entire season
[5:43:45] Extramediums: that and competitive pvp went the way of MOBA
[5:43:53] Mhortai: @zerx_gg And I blame that largely on Blizz. I will also say that I have seen people in the industry say WoW PvP could be as popular as PvE. WoW PvP is not like other MMO PvP, I have tried them all at this point lol.
[5:44:11] maulcus: Yo ven are conquest boxes out?!
[5:44:30] zerx_gg: wow pvp is definitely the best of all of them, but still wont compete with the pve aspect, pve is just too easy to get into
[5:44:37] Blitzylive: he's the bottom of the dps lol
[5:44:37] Mhortai: @Extramediums I mean the classes have changed, but that isn't because of PvP.  The systems largely work the same.
[5:44:39] DaraxBarex: Maybe if they made PvP even more casual friendly it will see some population resurgence
[5:45:49] SteLawBro: This might be a plus though...I just ran one of the new follower dungeons that came out today, just to see, and the AI was pretty crisp. HOPEFULLY...We can get some solid AI pvp or something to practice on between queue's...Maybe....
[5:45:52] Blitzylive: he did the least dmg lol
[5:45:57] Blitzylive: DH's did a lot
[5:45:57] SteLawBro: Mayybe people could learn against AI
[5:46:04] Mhortai: @DaraxBarex The have casual in the game (BGs) but it gets ZERO attention at this point. A little in War Within with the new BG but overall it got left to rod in favor of arena.
[5:46:05] Gushingcoom: dragon aint cleaving pets though
[5:46:07] Gushingcoom: like the dhs
[5:46:07] spacemanwx: Thats a BigDrag
[5:46:14] Blitzylive: dragon cleaves
[5:46:38] GoodyQQ: dev/arms seems fun
[5:46:39] DaraxBarex: @Mhortai true ig its mostly just blizz lacking any effort to innovate or change the things that's wrong with it. The PvP system is so outdated at this point
[5:47:02] DaraxBarex: I think PvP is just way too sweaty or complex compared to PVE for casuals to get into
[5:47:21] Abruty: too many classes/spec/buttons to learn
[5:47:25] McLarge: Hey Ven, beware of a Feral by the name of Yuxy. He rage whispered me after a Shuffle I was with him in and said some heinous shit. I reported and ignored him
[5:47:28] Abruty: compare to PVE where you just need to learn your class
[5:47:32] chrisiirc: if you have a brain you can learn pvp
[5:47:46] DaraxBarex: @Abruty true too much unnceessary bloat
[5:47:58] SteLawBro: Well theres a lot of difficulty for PVE. Everyone can find where they belong. Theres one skill level in PVP. Get ran down on until you figure it out.
[5:48:10] chrye_xx: hpal is infuriating to play in my experience lol
[5:48:20] DaraxBarex: @SteLawBro PVE is way easier to do than PVP though. You can literally reach 3k io blindfolded lol
[5:48:29] zerx_gg: yeah, but 3k io isnt high
[5:48:41] SteLawBro: @DaraxBarex Yea thats what im saying, its a lot more accesable.
[5:48:42] chrisiirc: why do people want an easy experience?
[5:48:54] Tridos_: I've been SSing on Hpal and I have a similar experience with a lot of comps. Just fall behind on the CD trade forever
[5:49:10] DaraxBarex: @zerx_gg but the point is accessibility. getting 3k is waaaay easier than arena
[5:49:28] Extramediums: resto druids are so far ahead of other healers right now, their kit is too good right now
[5:49:37] SteLawBro: I think PVP is hard to learn for a lot of people, myself included because when youre learning you feel like youre wasting everyone elses time lol.
[5:49:55] SteLawBro: Thats why i rather watch than play usually.
[5:49:57] MrZestie: @SteLawBro this one
[5:50:35] soddi: thats a nailbiter
[5:50:36] DaraxBarex: @SteLawBro For me I feel like it's cause fighting other players is way harder than fighting an AI boss with predictable mechanics
[5:50:50] zod_32: honestly wtf why is plate wearing healer so squishy into melee
[5:50:52] Mhortai: @SteLawBro PvP gets left out of everything as far as learning. Leveling etc all kind of teach you about pve mechanics, and they even have dungeon guides. PvE is thought to you in all aspects of the game, PvP you just get thrown in lol
[5:50:53] zod_32: makes 0 sense
[5:51:03] Abruty: Game feels like a shooter atm
[5:51:05] Gushingcoom: oh no they figured out the supreme strat
[5:51:05] GoodyQQ: we need an easy clean website like murlok.io, but for pairing up people who want to learn up with people who want to teach
[5:51:07] tarth_100: Being trained on hpal is sooo rough
[5:51:14] GoodyQQ: cause the ingame LFG is not friendly whether ur new or veteran
[5:51:19] Blitzylive: get bubble, focus hpal
[5:51:25] DaraxBarex: @Mhortai for real. Largely just really blizzard's fault cause they neglect the PVP community
[5:51:36] zod_32: train healer works best on hpala for sure
[5:51:49] wackpoetic: Man nothing can ruin my appetite for the game like Preservation lobbies
[5:52:05] zerx_gg: Would be nicer if pvp (arena) was a game on its own, I guess
[5:52:07] chrisiirc: @wackpoetic playing as them or versing them?
[5:52:11] DaraxBarex: PvP system is so outdated. Like they need some major changes. All the modern PVP games has better systems
[5:52:16] wackpoetic: literally type in warmup "please don't spread I have 30 yard range" gates open and they split 80 yards apart then complain about not getting heals
[5:52:25] zod_32: @DaraxBarex blizzard has pvp games with better systems
[5:52:28] SteLawBro: But now that the AI dungeons are up and running, hopefully we get some AI arena to run around and tweak stuff in. But watch, everyone just starts playing AI arena because its not toxic 😂
[5:52:39] zod_32: they just dont really care about PVP, people dont get that after 20 years
[5:52:42] GoodyQQ: @zerx_gg wonder how much money theyd make/lose if they sold arena as a standalone game for like $40 or $60, against lost subs who leave WoW for that game
[5:52:43] Blitzylive: no!!!!!! :-(
[5:52:44] tarth_100: lol maybe blind for rdruid, gotta get the treants somehow
[5:52:56] DaraxBarex: @zod_32 yeah mostly is that they cant do it or wont, its just they dont care lol
[5:53:00] bigkcp: class diff
[5:53:07] Ry_Bann: Ven what would you say is better for a new healer going into pvp? Hpal or Monk?
[5:53:10] zod_32: @GoodyQQ they're not doing this because they would barely lose any subs tbf compared to total player base
[5:53:23] DaraxBarex: @SteLawBro bro imagine if you get insta queues now cause healer will always be AI now lmao
[5:53:31] zerx_gg: They dont even have to drop subs or sell it as a standalone game @GoodyQQ
[5:53:32] ogdmt: crusad9Victorydance crusad9Victorydance
[5:53:46] zerx_gg: Just everything under one sub, like classic is
[5:53:55] limit77: DansGame
[5:54:04] zod_32: nah it's all about metrics
[5:54:07] zod_32: for the people really in charge
[5:54:07] chrisiirc: i like how they re did the nightfae covenant abilities
[5:54:07] SteLawBro: @DaraxBarex It would be insta every time. You hit queue and youre in with 5 fairly smart AI.
[5:54:09] zerx_gg: but with a dedicated dev team that focuses solely on it
[5:54:09] DaraxBarex: Blizzard could literally delete PvP and lose like 10% of their players or 5% lol
[5:54:15] zod_32: exactly
[5:54:59] DaraxBarex: @SteLawBro wouldn't that be awesome though? that would have to be some advanced Open AI shit where healer ai matches MMR
[5:55:05] SteLawBro: @DaraxBarex Oh i see what you mean. Actual AI in shuffles. I could honestly see it lol but it would have to be good or it would get trained down lol
[5:55:07] Blitzylive: you got 1!
[5:55:09] zerx_gg: THE SINGULAR WIN Pog
[5:55:12] zod_32: 1-5 noice
[5:55:15] zod_32: keep it rolling
[5:55:18] zod_32: 6-0 next lobby
[5:55:23] bladeslair: Bro 2k is gross rnow, I fell from 2k to 1800 last week
[5:55:25] Ry_Bann: Ven what would you say is better for a new healer going into pvp? Hpal or Monk? 󠀀
[5:55:35] SpectralSkull: <3
[5:55:44] DaraxBarex: @SteLawBro fr i mean its really exciting to think about what it could mean but idk if that will ever happen since all modern pvp games dont even have it. it would just lose purpose lol
[5:55:58] wackpoetic: I literally had a round on Pres where I healed 2.5x the enemy healer (18M to 7M), and I still had a DPS write "DUDE WHERE WERE MY HEALS?" the next round. Just so much toxicity to healers I already might be done this patch lol
[5:57:16] lang2001: @wackpoetic I feel this is much more common at lower ratings, or just a NA thing, I'm EU and can't say i've never been flamed as a healer but tbh rarely
[5:57:17] MrZestie: @wackpoetic its because most people who play dps dont give a shit about the numbers, they just think "hmmm i died, this healer sucks" its what ive come to learn after playing healer for a little bit
[5:57:26] SteLawBro: @DaraxBarex Yea, hhopefully they can figure somethhing out for people to get tossed into while queue is going. Then popped out of that into their game.
[5:57:51] zerx_gg: Guys, lets be honest, wow is a transmog farming game now anyway
[5:57:58] DaraxBarex: @SteLawBro fr. Right now though i think solo shuffle is the future. Most modern games just lets you solo queue. Blizz should just separate solo mmr and party mmr for those that want organized 3s
[5:58:03] SteLawBro: Think if done right could be a good time killer. Maybe even get bloodyyy tokens somehow.
[5:58:11] zerx_gg: rating is temporary, transmog is forever
[5:58:19] DaraxBarex: @zerx_gg ngl i have spent more time farming xmogs this week than pvp or pve lol
[5:58:19] MrZestie: @zerx_gg AMEN BROTHER
[5:58:43] zerx_gg: i should start a cult
[5:58:55] SteLawBro: Dude..Ive said for the longest time when people wanted world pvp back. Just add toys and pets. Everyone will be out there lol.
[5:58:56] Mhortai: @zerx_gg rukiGrin
[5:59:07] SteLawBro: You want people to PVP? pets...
[5:59:08] DaraxBarex: XMOG chads > PVP + PVE community kekw
[5:59:51] Mhortai: It comes down to rewards for PvP. All the new seasonal stuff is at high ratings. Nothing really gets added for the average player or casual/world pvp and hasn't for a long time.
[6:00:01] Mhortai: World PvP got some but most of it was at the start of the xpac
[6:00:24] Mhortai: PvE and world content has stuff to collect all over the place.
[6:00:28] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy leakyboots25 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[6:00:30] SteLawBro: This expac has seen the most world pvp by FAR and youre right, its because it actually had rewards. Go figure.
[6:00:35] zerx_gg: Time to add a pvp mage tower
[6:00:40] DaraxBarex: @Mhortai you think they should add xmog tier for 1600 and 1400?
[6:00:49] tarth_100: I was looking at those drustvar distributions. There are almost as many people at 1600 in SS as there are people playing the entire 3v3 bracket.
[6:01:10] zerx_gg: only if Joe is in there
[6:01:19] DaraxBarex: @tarth_100 wasnt there a stat where solo shuffle had 20x more games t han 3s?
[6:01:37] DaraxBarex: solo shuffle is the future so its no wonder
[6:01:41] tarth_100: I added all of the numbers in 3v3 and its like 22142 roughly
[6:01:47] Mhortai: @DaraxBarex Nah just keep tier there I guess, if there even is tier for pvp next xpac. I think there should be things to collect, and they need a NON RMT battlepass system.
[6:01:53] Perkasetz: Major sadge..
[6:01:56] Perkasetz: finding partners is ass.
[6:02:05] yesterday_potato: a
[6:02:06] DaraxBarex: people jsut dont wanna socialize and find partners
[6:02:06] Abruty: The game is just too hard to understand for most people
[6:02:08] yesterday_potato: SS is just fun
[6:02:10] chrisiirc: well 22000 characters not players right
[6:02:13] DaraxBarex: some jsut wanna log in, queue and play like ANY modern pvp game lol
[6:02:15] ur_boy_jd: hello ven!!
[6:02:18] Mhortai: @venruki keep in mine 3rd party sites can only pull 1500 and above from the API too, so all kinds of players left off there lol
[6:02:28] Perkasetz: its really easy to just click que with SS
[6:02:31] Perkasetz: 3s u gotta find partners
[6:02:36] Silentsmh: its crazy the dropoff from 1800 to 1900 lol
[6:02:36] ur_boy_jd: GREAT man, what's the vibe tonight
[6:02:42] DaraxBarex: yeah 3s is a waste of time without your consistent partners
[6:02:46] DaraxBarex: and any modern game has solo queue
[6:02:49] DaraxBarex: its just a no brainer
[6:02:51] zerx_gg: Most games that have a pve aspect have dead pvp, sadly
[6:03:08] dyllbarx: hi VEN
[6:03:19] Mhortai: and even then there are limits to how many players 3rd party sites can pull, so 3rd party sites don't show the whole picture.
[6:03:30] zerx_gg: I'm mostly talking compared to how popular pve is
[6:03:31] dyllbarx: good buddy just got home how are you today ?
[6:03:37] DaraxBarex: maybe not dead but dying or stagnant
[6:03:48] heho1231: @zerx_gg most pve games have dogshit pvp
[6:03:49] Moobot: Latest video "EVERYTHING NEW Coming In Patch 10.2.5 For World of Warcraft Dragonflight" view it here: youtu.be/_0UT1tK3q_g
[6:03:49] dyllbarx: Been back on the retail grind qs have actually been hot lots of fun
[6:03:56] dyllbarx: Work was good cold af !
[6:04:00] heho1231: wow arena is the only good pvp in any game that is mainly pve i stg
[6:04:00] zerx_gg: Exactly heho1231
[6:04:11] Mhortai: @zerx_gg Game is built around pve because the devs largely don't PvP I would say.
