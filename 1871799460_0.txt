[0:16:33] sindraxx: you dont boost stats like in dos2
[0:16:33] Murhemies: visible confusion
[0:16:33] Lyshty: gearing is very different in D&D then in Arpgs
[0:16:35] TheRandomOne: The gear would give you stats specifically.
[0:16:38] eliziejeff07: gm chat :)
[0:16:38] Ampitere: gear is more for defense ye
[0:16:38] Tenivir: yeah it is just not really a +stats game in the same way
[0:16:39] BasicWhiteGuyy: This is DnD not an RPG
[0:16:41] Naxzir: nope
[0:16:42] Fourfates: Stat boosts like that are hard to come across
[0:16:43] ind_i_go: class gear not attributes
[0:16:43] opuhol: Ye gear here is very good
[0:16:43] ItsPixelWolf: Correct
[0:16:44] OpnaStrike: You probably get stats from some trials shit
[0:16:46] Nutzens: Aiming and prediction of movement should be for wisdom
[0:16:47] Godofdeer: @sodapoppin its more gear that will give +1 ect or gear with spells or various effects on them
[0:16:47] Jingosu: there are a few high lvl gear that can increase stats

[4:40:52] shinigamidyo: vei is not real. vei is a fictional character. vei is prerecorded by soda during his offtime hours. he even speaks as vei but at a lower tone and slowly to fake her high pitch. soda is currently not in the uk either. hes in a shitty hotel cuz his house burned down again. have you ever seen them together? you havent. thats because soda cannot animate vei while being on cam himself. the reason soda left malena and nick is because he got kicked out. they could not handle his schizophrenia anymore
