[1:43:41] dimofodi: He said half the building was basically unused so when it went into use it destroyed their power grid setup or whatever.
[1:43:48] rhodistar: South of Italy
[1:43:55] rhodistar: A little island
[1:43:57] dimofodi: and to fix it everyone would have to pay a ton of money from the way it was built.
[1:43:59] LSBreed: No, the builders skimped on the amperage needed to run the house.
[1:44:01] BoezIRL: south of italy, it's an island
[1:44:28] Eshel: @theitalianstallion321  As a construction manager - I can tell you it probably wasn’t design - it was electrician sun saying “this is good enough”
[1:44:51] rhodistar: He is Swedish though :D So you got that part right
[1:44:51] Eshel: Minus “sun” - because my phone hates me lol

[1:45:05] dimofodi: He may have been in Sweden...apparently moving around Europe is like moving states
[1:45:07] JaeDee: You like the new desk?
[1:45:10] dimofodi: my personal take
[1:45:29] TheItalianStallion321: you need to know how many people will be in the building, what it will be used for, future use, etc.

[1:45:58] raffie2010: and malta and sweden BIG DIFRENCE
[1:46:08] thejuver: we know where you get the 11 inches back
[1:46:11] LSBreed: @dimofodi distance wise yes.it would be like moving from Michigan to like the Carolinas
[1:46:13] jerseyfive: isn't the us electricity net on the brick of total collapse
[1:46:13] TheMightyOdin: what was 11 inches

[1:49:54] TheItalianStallion321: and for me, @Eshel big residential buildings, with like 50 units or whatever, is almost considered commercial in NYC b/c of the scale of the work, its like in between residential and commercial
[1:50:26] Eshel: @theitalianstallion321  And you sound like the kind of electrician I’d rather have on site :)
[1:50:53] Eshel: @theitalianstallion321  Fair enough - I just assumed he was in a house I suppose - you right
[1:50:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: thats just texas

[3:54:04] Nickaasaur: true lol
[3:54:38] valianya: It'd be different if Blizzard was still printing and selling TCG
[3:54:40] Bowwjack: @Towelliee i agree though, making an inicitive to get people to play i really don't see it as a bad thing morally either simply because these are items that are hell to obtain now.
[3:54:44] Waiden01: Lost Ark is opposite. No tier 4 because many whales would CRY
[3:54:48] Gruffian: Blizzard only cares if it was tied to a reasonable skill level thing. Like challenge modes. Its not as hard as like a mythic final boss, but harder than casual content.
[3:54:52] CatsRusOfficial: Plus they the top 1% dont even pay for SUBs with their gold so it aint hurting their pocket
[3:54:56] Anbean: Anbean subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 112 months! 
[3:55:03] Nickaasaur: doesnt lost ark do catchup mechanics literally every tier?
[3:55:07] valianya: But the TCG is all out of print
[3:55:22] 3dRes: Unfortunate KEKW
[3:55:31] NobodybetterPat: im still mad lol
[3:55:52] 3dRes: I know it's not in season, but did you get the Love Rocket this year?
[3:55:57] CatsRusOfficial: Its the same with Firelands raggy mount 6 times in 3 weeks while doing terago mount quest
[3:56:45] ILikeKillTheZombies: im a casual and im subbed every month so far in DF, first time since legion

[3:59:23] dracullus: don't you think it's time for transmog to be unlocked without any class restrictions? collection game is too big nowadays to even track all of this and it sucks when you get some ultra transmog on 'wrong' class
[3:59:45] ILikeKillTheZombies: trading post was one of the best ideas they put to the game recently
[4:00:08] Alt_slash: YES

[4:01:09] moophoria2008: I stay because no other game satisfies
[4:01:11] Nickaasaur: easier to just use ET instead of specific zone

[4:09:10] byrdeen45: those shoulders never want to drop
[4:09:15] 3663Sharad: do tusk drop on heroic aswell? i thoght they only drop on mythic
[4:09:18] Nokterian: tusks are bigger than a gnome,goblin and vulpera
[4:09:21] firehawk73: not really tusks, more like toothpicks
[4:09:26] Eshel: Gnome be just dragging em behind lol
[4:09:36] zoovthepally: think we get any balance changes at reset this week?

[4:11:23] majorpipoo: WHAT you think will be next xpac ?
[4:11:39] PigPenLen: accused who?
[4:11:42] introvertnation: It's defamation 100%
[4:11:56] The_Marijuana_NA: next expac is VR world of warcraft Kappa
[4:11:58] reggiepowa: ddos that only affects wow connection and you can stream just fine, some advanced stuff Kappa
[4:11:58] introvertnation: Cyber crime like that is federal
[4:12:03] warrenny: Slander?
[4:12:06] Dudutoolbox: he didnt directly mention staysafe tho
[4:12:17] Eshel: Considering it’s accusation that could hurt their career - may be considered libel
[4:12:18] Mecabeast: I think 11.0 will be void and light themed
[4:12:26] DunzoCD: wasnt he talking about viewbotting too?
[4:12:42] rhodistar: That's crazy lol
[4:13:01] 3663Sharad: BOP
[4:13:05] herzlustafir: what? thats crazy? some ppl just want to see the world burn?
[4:13:06] The_Marijuana_NA: bro i played runescape for 9 years it was a big problem when you would face clans like reign of terror and violent resolution
[4:13:16] CousinAvi86: what was their reasoning for doing that? just for content?

[4:16:07] 3663Sharad: A GM secretly attempting to disable the tusk from the loot table LUL
[4:16:13] TheItalianStallion321: that guy's stream is so toxic...and annoying i cant stomach looking at a still picture of him let alone watch his stream
[4:16:15] ILikeKillTheZombies: Is there more drama on classic than retail usually?
[4:16:46] egraves7: there's more and it's juicier too. top-shelf drama on classic

[4:23:49] PigPenLen: yeah that is best case too
[4:23:54] zeeAbe: PoE 2 was supposed to release this year, so that is why the hopes were so high. This was back when it was just an expansion for PoE
[4:24:19] Mostdangspy: The next PoE league seems fun. Im excited
[4:24:30] abracka_: busted out laughing hearing him say "i don't even know wtf is going on anymore"
[4:24:35] TheItalianStallion321: there were a lot of moans and groans too from the autobattle.
[4:24:38] TheItalianStallion321: from what i read
[4:24:40] xmedpakx: chat , how many of you are heading to blizzcon? or maybe some have no interest perhaps
[4:24:50] Murlocz: Wait this bee is now faction wide?
[4:24:52] valianya: I'm convinced lalafels are evolutionary cuckoo birds.  They are small and perpetually childlike to get bigger races to protect them, take care of and forgive any transgressions like they're kids.  Because every npc lalafel is a conniving schemer and nobody punts them.
[4:24:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: so much other stuff releasing soon might skip this league
[4:24:57] LuiBMHunter: would we normally know what's on the trading post in Aug by now?
[4:25:18] TheItalianStallion321: i have tons of interest in blizzcon. its going alone i just dont want to do. i have 0 people that i have to go with
[4:25:23] Syllvn: @LuiBMHunter It was in the end of June video, they showed off both months
[4:25:48] Shirey36: ppl moan and groan about games not coming out when they want but they also moan and grown when they are released too early and have bugs  ppl are never happy
[4:25:48] ILikeKillTheZombies: blood troll armor probably as monthly reward
[4:26:01] Nibbel__: blood troll transmog is coming
[4:26:01] MenacingMeow: I’m excited for the closed beta of Palia this week
[4:26:23] Mecabeast: Snap I have to log in and get my rewards from the post for the month
[4:26:31] TheItalianStallion321: i think it was all COPIUM that they thought it was this year
[4:26:42] abracka_: they announced a "few" of the things for august trading post, being the spirit of competition pet and the bloodhunter tmog set
[4:26:42] Armdel: i think people were just expecting some big announcements when so much time had passed with no news
[4:27:01] Aquadriel: typical gamers shooting themselves in the foot
[4:27:03] valianya: Said poe2 in 24.  Poe1 season this year.
[4:27:07] duurra: I think they had hopes for this year but that was before covid I believe
[4:27:09] abracka_: i think the other two things they said were the alabaster mounts from the store
[4:27:32] BaxGamin: Chat and towelliee deciding to start tanking what’s a good class to learn?
[4:27:33] Jodicus: They announced it is its own game now. Ta-da!
[4:28:07] Molvonos: Unique graphics, too
[4:28:08] Mostdangspy: They definitely gave a lot more information about PoE2 than we knew before. Like the stuff with the weapon swaps
[4:28:11] BaxGamin: Okay thank you
[4:28:12] ghostmutt_tv: bear tank is pretty great
[4:28:15] darkrowse21: do you think we are going on other side of azeroth for 11.0 with all pirate clues in DF
[4:28:23] Nickaasaur: yeah bears are awesome right now
[4:28:29] Carahail: @BaxGamin I started with Bear when O first learned
[4:28:48] PigPenLen: yeah the announcement of it being separate from PoE 1 is the biggest shock to me
[4:28:49] Zettabyte: Yarr?
[4:28:50] sharkx31: spam Hc for it with roll
[4:28:54] ILikeKillTheZombies: bfa was pretty mucb pirate-ish

[4:33:00] twarnak: WoW 2.0

[4:34:59] AnimalCrackers_19: Shadowland 2.0?
[4:35:00] Dudutoolbox: an xpac like that i feel like would take a lot of time of developement
[4:35:16] DunzoCD: what sword?
[4:35:19] abracka_: what sword
[4:35:21] Masqerader: what sword?
[4:35:29] Wcvechten: We could make her play Gacha games
[4:35:34] smiles82: THE WOONS?
[4:35:36] Molvonos: And worst thing yet?  There's no way that Azeroth isn't a furry.
[4:35:41] tdpark_: why this log out always happened? it happened to me too
[4:35:42] ILikeKillTheZombies: magni will return
[4:35:43] Masqerader: Sargeras a real hero, never pulls out
[4:35:47] zoovthepally: que espada?
[4:35:47] xXSiebzehnXx: We’re gonna have an “It was all a dream” expansion. We here we didn’t win against N’zoth
[4:35:50] hammack52: all i have to say is i dont want to be a titan near her when she does wake cause she is going to be pissed
[4:35:52] geokouts: There is NO Sword on Azeroth!!!
[4:35:53] abracka_: @Molvonos towStop towIt
[4:35:54] Mecabeast: What sword
[4:35:54] Eshel: Wouldn’t the other races just appearing in the past wreck the lore though? - since all the elves are descended from trolls and orcs/dranei haven’t even showed up yet etc
[4:36:03] Conzec89: Stop talking about magni, that shit makes me getting PTSD KEKW
[4:36:08] falldrgn: Ironically all the worst expansions took place off..our world lol
[4:36:19] trivotix: Azeroth is in the hood
[4:36:21] EthicalHermit: odds on Xal'atath being Azeroth's alternate timeline or something?
[4:36:34] zoovthepally: TBC was great and it was off world
[4:36:38] Molvonos: Xalatath and Azshara's love child.
[4:36:44] mavericks312: There’s some out there who thinks it could be yogg
[4:36:51] falldrgn: WOONS!!!

[4:37:47] TheItalianStallion321: HEAL THE WOONS
[4:37:49] xHukk: someone said they forsee a cataclysm reset type event.
[4:37:52] Trawkey: Trawkey subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 107 months! 
[4:37:54] Wcvechten: I was maybe expecting C;thun returning back in BFA because of all the azerite in his vicinity maybe ressing him
[4:37:55] Dudutoolbox: when do you think they are going to enable old world 60-70 leveling?
[4:37:56] Karn1987: Champion you got to heal the woons
[4:37:57] Cal_Kat: find out magni was a void lord all long using us SMOrc
[4:38:00] belfastcl: is the next expansion launching in 2025? or 2024
[4:38:22] geokouts: Pantheon saw us like ants basically
[4:38:29] Dudutoolbox: well the planet dying is a big deal, two races fighting amongst themselves it's their own business
[4:38:32] falldrgn: I would say late 2024. if they announce at blizzcon
[4:38:32] Wcvechten: they're still  kinda locked up with Sargeras and Illidan right?
[4:38:34] Masqerader: they would just send sargeras down, be like do your think bro
[4:38:37] zoovthepally: they had thrall on the blizzcon advertisement stuff wonder if that shows that he'll be involved in the next expac in a big way
[4:38:38] rymerre: wouldnt the titans just beat his ass thou?
[4:38:44] Molvonos: Problem with that logic though: BFA happened immediately after Legion, didn't it?  The Titans were still recuperating from the events with Argus.  So how could they interfere?

[4:38:58] DunzoCD: thats when Illidans gonna come back towing Sargeras behind him
[4:39:20] Molvonos: The titans weren't in any position to help, between being sapped of strength from Argus/Sargeras, plus Sargeras was only recently imprisoned.
[4:39:22] reggiepowa: jailer was the most powerful
[4:39:42] rymerre: old gods were powerful but also imprisoned by the titans
[4:39:43] KingSlayerYotam: Bro we bonked the jailer well manage
[4:39:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: sargeras gonna switch sides again and pull that sword out
[4:40:03] zoovthepally: lets go ask him
[4:40:04] FruckAwesome: means we are the most powerful hehe
[4:40:12] ILikeKillTheZombies: we have to revive jailer
[4:40:12] Wcvechten: It's obviously Sylvanas, that's why he wanter her in his service
[4:40:23] DunzoCD: hes Thanos
[4:40:25] zoovthepally: there wasnt any story ;)
[4:40:27] Tcrane_: its the love child of illidan and tyrande ;D
[4:40:37] Molvonos: Nah, he was trying to destroy her at the end of that raid.
[4:40:38] Mozzeyy_: nobody knows tbh
[4:40:49] zoovthepally: he was coming for the soul of our world
[4:40:53] zoovthepally: thats all i remember
[4:40:54] Syllvn: He wanted to control everything to fight what was coming. He just wanted power for 'an enemy'
[4:40:56] ronny_84: control
[4:41:00] Wcvechten: Like, if  I can't get her, then nobody can kinda moment
[4:41:07] ronny_84: he wanted to dominate all the cosmos
[4:41:10] rymerre: @Syllvn just like the legion
[4:41:10] Eshel: Question - since the well of eternity was formed from the wound in Azeroth - would removing Sargeras’ sword have a similar effect ?
[4:41:11] Masqerader: he wanted to remake reality
[4:41:12] Mecabeast: Remake creation and break the cycle of life and death
[4:41:18] Snabido: Thought he was using her azerite thing to power whatever engine he was in
[4:41:19] Cerina_Serog: Tusks on second run, new skip is nice
[4:41:21] rymerre: thats the same thing the Legion wanted
[4:41:29] SSD511_: towChad hello
[4:41:42] geokouts: right now i am trying come up with a expantion that dont include messing up a timeline
[4:41:48] zoovthepally: shadowlands was all a dream
[4:41:53] zoovthepally: who shot jr
[4:41:55] Gruffian: Azeroth being corrupted, and having to save the planet from becoming like Argus would be a pretty dope xpac.
[4:42:01] DannyG757: Sup T
[4:42:02] tonyr23: I wanna see momma sylvanas again
[4:42:09] DunzoCD: shadowlands shouldve ended with Men in Black neuralizing everyone

[4:42:13] ILikeKillTheZombies: who's the new leader of burning legion?
[4:42:15] Masqerader: let's not forget about Daddy  Denathrius
[4:42:24] gHOsTa81: devs were definetely on drugs when they made the story for shadowlands
[4:42:28] KingSlayerYotam: arent there any other planets just leave azeroth alone
[4:42:28] PigPenLen: forget shadowlands existed.. was my forgotten 20s
[4:42:30] Wcvechten: oh right, Denathrius is till free
[4:42:31] SSD511_: Yeah lot to go with
[4:42:31] Murlocz: Sylvanas Kappa
[4:42:41] flookguy: What are the best tanks for aberrus right now?
[4:42:46] CoolioDoom: Sounds like Eternals lol, stopping the Celestial fully emerging.
[4:42:48] Mecabeast: Old gods wanted a piece
[4:42:53] zoovthepally: Denathrius as a expac villain could work
[4:42:59] rymerre: the OG dreadlord...he could be anyone/anywhere
[4:43:14] Zettabyte: Toweliiee wants a piece Kappa
[4:43:22] ILikeKillTheZombies: jaina will be revealed as dreadlord Kappa
[4:43:27] Gruffian: The player was a dreadlord the whole time
[4:43:34] aumixp: I just want guildhalls or player housing at this point
[4:43:35] valianya: Denathrius should have been the big bad of Shadowlands
[4:43:36] Mecabeast: Atleast we finally put malganis down
[4:43:41] Murlocz: Anyone else always DC during garrosh encounter
[4:43:44] geokouts: maybe next expantion will be Emerald Dream themed
[4:43:52] ILikeKillTheZombies: i like the story besides dracthyr and sarkareth
[4:43:54] laeenaravenholdt: We need another Nobbel/Towel strum soon.
[4:43:57] zoovthepally: i dont think theyll touch shadowlands with a 90 foot pole
[4:43:58] Wcvechten: I just expect another world tree to burn next patch
[4:44:10] killswiitch: What about the massive sword???
[4:44:12] rhodistar: Does anyone really die in this game? lol
[4:44:18] Molvonos: I'd hope so, since we killed his ass in the Shadowlands, his home plane.
[4:44:20] TheItalianStallion321: when the FUCK  are we going to get Hogger as a raid boss??
[4:44:23] Masqerader: in the nether
[4:44:41] flookguy: Personally, I found wrath to be the most enjoyable story.
[4:44:45] Molvonos: Yea, Dethanrius created them in Shadowlands.
[4:44:45] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[4:44:46] geokouts: we killed the big ones on their home turf
[4:44:47] Eshel: Yep - that’s why Sargeras went all “burn it all” in the first place
[4:44:56] Mozzeyy_: @Towelliee whens the gnoll raid coming?
[4:45:01] hammack52: i would fucking hope that if you died in the realm of death you would stay fucking dead
[4:45:05] zoovthepally: we killed an alternate timeline Archimonde right?
[4:45:10] Molvonos: All Dreadlords home-plane is Shadowlands, which made killing them stupid hard.  Any Dreadlords we killed in Shadowlands, stay dead, I'd imagine.
[4:45:23] MattJ063: That is AU Archimonde
[4:45:23] TheItalianStallion321: @zer0thehero117 dammit
[4:45:30] MattJ063: they retconned that with this patch
[4:45:44] rhodistar: Elon Musk comes and fly us to Mars
[4:45:44] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[4:45:45] xHukk: LUL
[4:45:45] CoolioDoom: Maybe we go back to stop the sword being stabbed into azzy?
[4:45:46] Mecabeast: Dreadlords were created by denathrius and he had to banish them from revendreth to appease
[4:45:54] zoovthepally: our archimonde is likely regenerating, bellular just made a video on this
[4:45:55] callum_bm: wow 2 confimed
[4:45:55] Karn1987: dradlords are from revendreth
[4:45:57] xHukk: Thats when I can finally get space marines as a class.  <3
[4:45:59] rymerre: that would be the biggest plot twist
[4:46:00] AkiriousNature: that would be WoW 2
[4:46:01] Wcvechten: And then they find a planet with a continent called Eorzea, WoW x FF crossover begins
[4:46:01] marchofpotatos: even if they went somewhere else, Azeroth wouldn't be out of the picture story wise
[4:46:03] geokouts: WoW 2 Electric Boogaloo
[4:46:06] PotbellyGoat: we move to Sanctuary
[4:46:17] OhNoNotAgain: long as soon as azeroth is corrupted, we get to see a pan to Magni's face
[4:46:20] hammack52: 20th anniversity of WoW, we get the announcment of WoW 2 lol
[4:46:30] rymerre: time travel is such a cop out
[4:46:38] rhodistar: The butterfly effect
[4:46:38] ILikeKillTheZombies: garrosh will be alive
[4:46:39] DunzoCD: just put more Chromies everywhere EZ
[4:46:41] Eshel: The lord would be completely fucked
[4:46:44] SSD511_: Did they will announce the next expansion in blizzcon ?
[4:46:47] Eshel: *lore
[4:46:50] geokouts: brand new planet to do player housing!!!
[4:46:52] Reckless_Monk: Nah we going to the other side of the planet. Look at FF14 theyre going to the "new world" South American theme
[4:47:14] thechrippeshow: time for New World
[4:47:27] botscast: theres interesting wowhead speculation comment about 11.0 if i can link @Towelliee
[4:47:29] ghostmutt_tv: im hoping they announce some form of classic plus
[4:47:30] xHukk: Maybe.  Azerath dies and the game is over/concluded.  Then we get a new MMO.  :O  MIND BLOWN!
[4:47:33] ohnot___her: When is blizzcon
[4:47:33] rymerre: @Reckless_Monk cant go to a new area on the world when the world hatches and turns into a titan
[4:47:36] zeeAbe: FOR AZEROTH!
[4:47:41] xmedpakx: maybe we help azeroth save another would soul
[4:47:45] american_peasant: FAMILY
[4:47:49] Hononoe: family
[4:47:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: expansion starts with everything going to shit planet being destroyed but we get sent back to fix shit
[4:47:51] flookguy: Why not have an xpac where everything is peachy and we just want to get really good gear
[4:47:53] Hybridsteve: im fighting to see the sword removed
[4:47:53] Wcvechten: I mean, with the sea themed xmog and mount they recently released, I expect some other island continent reveal
[4:47:53] ILikeKillTheZombies: For azmerloth. Kappa
[4:48:03] Reckless_Monk: @Reckless_Monk I think we will see a Avatar of Azeroth in the next expansion
[4:48:06] Mr_Junt: Night Elves can’t dance good. War.
[4:48:09] SSD511_: Excited for what comes next
[4:48:43] Reckless_Monk: @Reckless_Monk Her helping us in a new Contitnent
[4:48:50] ghostmutt_tv: go the FF route and blow up azeroth and just restart everything. call it: A world restarted lolll
[4:48:51] Wcvechten: Tel'Abim and such are still a thing, and ingame lorebook in Uldaman did mention an island that is hard to reach
[4:48:55] geokouts: Wailing Caverns collectibles retunred in 10.1.5 per Wowhead
[4:49:07] Celestia6: Azshara is still out there too
[4:49:10] Eshel: I still wonder if removing Sargeras’ sword will create another Well of Eternity situation …. Could lead to some plot lines
[4:49:10] deckardblade: Wait no 10.3 raid?
[4:49:17] Mozzeyy_: Bellular had video of some island where weve never been to
[4:49:18] ILikeKillTheZombies: i would love some 1 or 2 bosses raid
[4:49:25] hammack52: we are going to go to the titan home world next
[4:49:29] ryanmoss35: there is a raid in 10.3
[4:49:42] MenacingMeow: Yea Tel’abim is an area we’ve never been to before, the island with all the bananas
[4:49:52] zoovthepally: i hope there is a 10.3 but patch cadence wise it doesnt seem like there will be another tier after 10.2
[4:49:59] Reckless_Monk: People bring up Avelor a place beyond the Seas
[4:50:02] zoovthepally: outside of a remix tier
[4:50:24] ashwing_: Its Zereth Ordos or w.e
[4:50:26] Molvonos: Well, if there's a realm of death, there's a realm of order, where the Titans came from
[4:50:27] Wcvechten: the Uldaman lore books from DF had some neat new lore hints
[4:50:29] Colt_Engineer: Did ya get the tusks yet?
[4:50:30] 3663Sharad: Orderland KEKW
[4:50:34] geokouts: to the Pantheon homeland to learn more about them and Azeroth
[4:50:52] zoovthepally: it could go either way remix or another tier...we'll see
[4:51:28] Eshel: 10.3 will be an epilogue to tie up loose ends story wise - nothing spectacular imo
[4:51:31] 3663Sharad: I hope for another new tier, storywise it would be cooler imo
[4:51:38] ILikeKillTheZombies: i wonder if we kill iridikron this expansion
[4:51:56] Wcvechten: true, they would never put an old god as a patch outta nowhere
[4:51:59] Wcvechten: wait a minute
[4:52:04] ashwing_: @ILikeKillTheZombies nah next it Fyrakk and then Vyranoth and thats it
[4:52:22] zoovthepally: i think it would be cool if 10.2 ended fyrak or whatever and then we fight the other incarnates in like a 3-4 boss raid during the remix season
[4:52:25] herzlustafir: maybe unspoken yet
[4:52:32] ILikeKillTheZombies: @ILikeKillTheZombies i guess both in the same raid
[4:52:42] Molvonos: Pretty sure Iridikron and Vyranoth will be surviving this expansion

[4:56:32] tdpark_: is it when you click the skip?
[4:56:54] zoovthepally: did you put a gtx 580 back in?
[4:57:12] moistdanglez: it always happens when i go to run in there on a character, since they created the skip
[4:57:12] dimofodi: The other day hitting one of the abilities in a whelp race would auto-disconnect me randomly.
[4:57:20] SSD511_: Lol
[4:57:20] xmedpakx: not familiar with paho
[4:57:27] MaleFrom73: My rogue on cromie time in mop as faling endlessly after a Shadowstrike.
[4:57:30] tdpark_: it log me out everytime when I click the skip the last raid boss
[4:57:48] PigPenLen: inspector Clouseau
[4:57:55] zeiours: I'm curious when the pantheon will return, wanna see illidan and kill Jaden
[4:57:59] Mozzeyy_: LUL
[4:58:05] Wcvechten: ''only if you can carry me through mythic sarkareth''
[4:58:08] dimofodi: Tell him it has a negative impact on your finances.
[4:58:08] zoovthepally: if you pretend like your from the world of warcraft he might
[4:58:15] 3663Sharad: KEKW
[4:58:17] valianya: My prediction is we go to Emerald Dream to kill Fyrakk.  Ice lady might die too or turn coat, but likely she and Iridikron disappear to scheme for future expansion.  Possibly scheming with new pal Xal'atath, but she's probably just using them.  Next expansion they're probably a side story and don't star till at least expansion after next.  We might see return of Azshara next expansion, or even alt Draenor Light crusade, possibly Emerald dream, or something new.
[4:58:17] Megadisaster24: usually, if you say you're mildly racist, they don't pick you
[4:58:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: your luck the judge would be a classic andy
[4:58:20] dimofodi: It would cause financial hardship
[4:58:29] whamtv: just say you like cops and youll prolly get struck
[4:58:31] FubarSnafuJJ: You have specific prior non avoidable contracts
[4:58:34] BiggTC: Tell him you can't be unbias in whatever case and they'll dismiss you
[4:58:34] Eshel: @dimofodi  The blink in that race - it’s extremely buggy
[4:58:38] MattJ063: and then towelliee is held in contempt of court
[4:58:49] dimofodi: Ah so you want to be honest but still get out of jury duty....nope :(
[4:59:02] dimofodi: @Eshel I gave up on the race eventually.
[4:59:08] zoovthepally: judge plays and alliance and towel is screwed
[4:59:14] Jokervenom1978: Towellii gonna send a jaywalker to the electric chair.
[4:59:22] zoovthepally: judge plays alliance*
[4:59:35] LloydInSpace04: case may get settled before you even go
[4:59:44] herzlustafir: what did i miss? elctric what?
[4:59:48] Eshel: @dimofodi  You just gotta time the other two abilities carefully - you won’t get gold but you will get completion
[4:59:56] whamtv: its a class c citation, if the defandant wants to take it to court it can go to trial
[5:00:40] whamtv: most of the time the defandant wants to take it to trial to see if the cop shows up, if they dont show, the ticket gets dismissed
[5:00:45] Raddius: In CA they have Freedom to Walk Act.  Jaywalking isn't illegal now.
[5:00:47] 3663Sharad: are you are juror?
[5:00:51] Eshel: I was in a jury for lawsuit after car wreck - trial lasted one day - next morning started deliberation - we had verdict by 10 but waited til after the free lunch to inform the judge lol
[5:00:59] herzlustafir: GlitchCat
[5:01:02] whamtv: lol youd be surprised, been to ticket couyrt alot
[5:01:13] PotbellyGoat: my Wife took her speeding ticket to court and lost. I still laugh
[5:01:16] aumixp: Wtf is jaywalking ?
[5:01:35] RoboMaximillion: smart
[5:01:35] Eshel: It was lol
[5:01:44] hammack52: considering your state just say you are pro corperl punishment and you will be out of jury duty
[5:01:48] firehawk73: we did the same thing on an open/shut case...got pizza out of it

[5:02:26] valianya: Depends, if he was jaywalker and got hit, to get insurance coverage might need to prove wasn't jaywalker so not at fault for crash
[5:02:27] rymerre: not really free when you consider the work time you lose
[5:02:30] firehawk73: you dont have to eat it...lol
[5:02:42] Eshel: We were in deliberation so couldn’t leave the room - they gave us a menu and we got to order from that
[5:02:47] Raddius: @Towelliee You have so many questions that will all be answered if you go to jury duty. :)
[5:02:56] zeiours: Are the server down?
[5:03:03] geokouts: when you get there IMMEDIATELY ask what are we gonna eat!

[5:03:44] whamtv: yeah they do it for striking
[5:03:51] Eshel: I’m weird - I enjoyed jury duty - I’d be a professional juror if I could lol
[5:03:57] Molvonos: They're trying to find a very specific jury
[5:03:57] PigPenLen: hell no, say yes and jet out of there
[5:04:03] geokouts: some questions might exclude you from jury
[5:04:08] firehawk73: dont forget...you are hispanic and can fill a "quota" if they need it
[5:04:20] Raddius: Depending on the case, yep, they ask crazy stuff.  I've been asked if I knew what furies are, Hentai, etc.
[5:04:26] sirtoasted: Just questions to see if your going to be bias on the case
[5:04:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: another 20 or so years you never have to worry about it again
[5:04:27] kingdaddy96: They are trying to disqualify you by bias. If you have family in law enforcement it's virtually an instant walk
[5:04:32] Bawpears: I have Jury Duty this Wednesday
[5:04:37] DunzoCD: the lawyers usually want certain people that potentially lean their way so they want to know your background
[5:04:41] moistdanglez: just tell them you are anti cop/law and the layers will excuse you and get the next person
[5:04:44] Hybridsteve: you cannot volunteer for jury duty
[5:04:52] tezrelli: why not just put on a clown outfit and tell them that moon's haunted and earth is flat. no jury duty coxSteven
[5:05:02] zoovthepally: "jurors raise your hands if you have the infinite timereaver mount" all jurors but towel raise hands

[5:05:23] 3663Sharad: Towrl IRL court stream KEKW
[5:05:24] firehawk73: i always get picked because im Puerto Rican
[5:05:31] Scarhearth: ive never gotten jury duty summons yet
[5:05:55] Raddius: I just postponed mine until January.  I got called for August, but there's a lot of standing outside sometimes and in the summer nobody wants to be sweaty crammed in close with people.
[5:05:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: show up dressed as the Amish
[5:05:58] firehawk73: nope, ohio
[5:06:29] Sarocus: I got picked for jury duty despite being a foreigner :p
[5:06:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: it can be entertaining when the judge shuts them down for their bullshit
[5:06:41] Velarn435: Just tell them "I can see a guilty man from a mile away!"...
[5:06:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: excuses
[5:06:48] SourSpence: i dont know if anyone has mentioned this yet but have you seen the show "Jury Duty?
[5:06:53] JakZones: I straight up told the defendant that I would believe the cop over him 10 times out of 10 and he still choose me to be a juror
[5:07:16] OhNoNotAgain: The amount of people who had posted their jury duty info on social media, deputy had to come in and was like you got 5 minutes to remove the info.
[5:07:24] valianya: I was bought all the way to being interrogated by lawyers to see if they want to dismiss as not appropriate peers, I said I couldn't in good conscience judge innocent till proven guilty, because defendent was being accused of molesting by multiple kids he's  related to, and I feel those accusations don't come from nothing happening
[5:07:26] ILikeKillTheZombies: i think he posted copied his password by accident. :D
[5:07:30] madbombz_fth: stil waiting for dragonsoul skip

[5:08:23] Eshel: Have you ever got a parking ticket ? How did you feel about it?
[5:08:42] Raddius: You're not going to get a ticket case.  You're going to end up on a gang case for your first. :P

[5:09:23] milupeta: HeyGuy
[5:09:37] Raddius: Just answer honest.  The lawyers dismiss a lot of people as the makeup of the jury forms.
[5:09:37] rhodistar: Now leave me alone
[5:09:38] whamtv: you show up, they'll pick their panel, and then they do striking
[5:09:39] rhodistar: Kekw

[5:10:13] dtp4444: there is a tv show called jury duty where everyone is an actor involved in a fake jury trial except for one person thinking its a real trial. pretty funny show
[5:10:18] theoriginalzinng: smol indy co
[5:10:28] valianya: @towelliee  You're most likely to be allowed to excuse yourself because you're self employed and will take a huge hit to income if the trial lasts days.

[5:10:33] Prevention6: wtf i got gifted a sub to a channel i dont follow lol
[5:10:34] xXSiebzehnXx: My friend just said “I feel like most the time cops do the right thing, and as someone who backs the police force I don’t think they would make a decision unless they thought it was just or the system just wouldn’t be working” and they excused him
[5:10:41] NordoTv: Towelliee gonna get selected for one of those 6-month trials  = More Lula streams :)

[5:13:26] Eshel: Sovereign citizens are a whole different breed - they don’t think they need drivers licenses - license plates - shut like that
[5:13:57] Raddius: And there's your answer.  The key is to not understanding much of what they ask you and make sure they know you aren't understanding...
[5:13:58] ijuki: 1 too many Kappa
[5:14:08] geokouts: tell them you play WoW ;)
