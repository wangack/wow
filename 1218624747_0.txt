[2:37:32] StreamElements: Swifty is on Nightfall (PVP) Horde for Seasons of Mastery
[2:37:36] ivomagnum: I mean, they have the MagTrain, that does what you say Swifty
[2:37:53] Batwingzdk: cars themselves arent safe lol
[2:37:54] MattAchuxD: isnt that a helicopter?
[2:38:05] eternalnibster: mesh guard on top and bottom would be a pretty good half measure
[2:38:11] oneiros_mk2: most places have a weight limit over a certain size requires a permit/license
[2:38:13] Tomoglaziat: and would have to have redundancy
[2:38:17] machomadness78: marine 05 - 09 seems like every other week in the marine corps times there was a helicopter crash one after the other and so many marines died.  im NEVER getting into a helicopter.  freaking Kobe passed that way too cmon
[2:38:17] Treesy__: First we have to figure out how to do cold fusion on a large scale
[2:38:25] nc716: do u like queso dip?
[2:38:26] biggiemens: parachute
[2:38:30] iPlayx64: ring encasing around propellors
[2:38:33] ceecer: @Batwingzdk yeah but a mechanical failure in a car isn't an almost guaranteed death like it would be on a drone
[2:38:44] danwiche: birds take out aircraft engines, no doubt it would do as much damage to a drone propeller
[2:38:49] BoricuaSJ: Just blame Isaac Newton for inventing gravity...
[2:38:57] AliveElement: cage off the propellers, make 4 large ones and 4 small ones for stablizing when a main propeller fails to safely land
[2:39:02] ivomagnum: @Treesy74 no no no, first we need to find out Who Let the Dogs Out
[2:39:17] Batwingzdk: @ceecer true
[2:39:29] Clothsack: like a hoovercraft?
[2:39:36] Tomoglaziat: have to have 8 props 4 used all the time and 3 redundant props
[2:39:44] dslims: Must Airplanes could lose an engine and still be fine, Safest way to travel.
[2:39:57] martindensyge: how did you get the name swifty?

[2:40:00] johngalang6: kinda like the hovering cars in Dragon Ball?
[2:40:02] BelgianButcher: I only own a Bicycle, I don't want to imagine what such vehicles would cost for the people.
[2:40:04] heradoo: The A-10 Warthog is a drone of sorts. The engines can move to be a helicopter drone and then also an airplane. The technology is there
[2:40:21] danwiche: an airplane can lose all its engines and still glide back safely, I don't think a drone could
[2:40:31] Tomoglaziat: Ospry imo

[2:45:56] MattAchuxD: didnt they already make a city in mars? and want to send like 1million people to it by next year
[2:45:58] D1rtyBurger: i wonder if a asteroid hit the moon if it could push it into our gravitational pull, and cause majora's mask to happen for real
[2:46:06] DemirroTV: hey Swifty! como estas hermano?!?!?!
[2:46:07] BoricuaSJ: I hear it will be a great location to find out who your father really is

[2:48:21] Tomoglaziat: guess we will have to live underground then
[2:48:22] Dwarsbalk: there are strong signs that you would arrive completely blind after a 2 year trip to Mars
[2:48:25] Iron1kg: this is ToS, youre not allowed to learn on twitch

[2:49:53] KaVie_808: @iPlayx64 thats how it was in vanilla
[2:49:53] BoricuaSJ: I loved my shamaln healer in Lich king days.. chain healing was EZ
[2:49:57] KaVie_808: shamasn were pink
[2:49:57] Cowardpatty: Because it's classic and you couldn't be paladin AND shaman on the same faction, so only 1 color (pink) was needed.
[2:49:59] aggedev_: can someone remind me why people believe moving to mars from earth is a good idea.
[2:50:01] xaddyqt: xaddyqt subscribed with Prime. 
[2:50:01] StreamElements: xaddyqt just subscribed PogChamp

[2:50:47] Cowardpatty: I think life is an inevitable outcome of the laws of the universe
[2:50:48] Yell0w_Sn0w: universe is endless, so there is 100% other life
[2:51:11] Tomoglaziat: Terra farming experiment  tehee
[2:51:19] aggedev_: whats the definition of life
[2:51:26] Enmael00: stay away from monks... they do the interrupts
[2:51:31] dslims: So deductive reasoning would conclude that currently only the goldiloks planets could support life.
[2:51:50] Tomoglaziat: titan

[10:07:55] swagrlicious: Yeah the 40% quest xp bonus only  adds up to about 15-20% faster than classic at most,
[10:08:00] veganhealer: you just need a healer
[10:08:08] Pulsair: yea i lvled 5 characters without boosting to 60 in classic and i still think its slow.
[10:08:11] Lampweek: There won't be powerleveling communities like in Diable because there's an actual economy in WoW. It will always be miserable.
[10:08:12] Kushzgang: yeah bad drop rates  fs
