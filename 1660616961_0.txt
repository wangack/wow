[1:07:15] Phantomstrk: The next day. So the Tuesday
[1:07:15] Kelticlore: blizz be clear
[1:07:15] geokouts: so when EU maintance ends
[1:07:16] ElmSpace: This is vague.  Why not just say 29th/30th
[1:07:18] neggst: within a few hours
[1:07:19] manetmannen: so that you can't rush and get a full reset of m0 gear I think, should be the very next day
[1:07:24] notsupportiv: It comes out Monday weekly reset comes 29th
[1:07:31] neggst: so it should be just the rewards before the rewards
[1:07:34] tanek1966: So, in other words, you can't do any of that on Monday night.
[1:07:35] Phantomstrk: Cause dragon flight is Monday and Tuesday is maintenance and that‚Äôs the ‚Äúnew week‚Äù
[1:07:35] Malarick: they cant be specific b/c Ion is a lawyer.  Lawyers are never specific

[1:08:27] morp1onz: Exactly
[1:08:27] pedrobosseljon: yes its next day
[1:08:36] ncatter: its just so people dont think they need to pull an allnighter on the first day yea
[1:08:40] pedrobosseljon: so people dont rush 70 and do m0 before tuesday

[4:37:22] KhetumTV: its just well rounded
[4:37:36] Awikan: Yo chat, is it quicker to level from 1-60 via invasions or just normal levelling?

[4:38:24] Zilberg: Odds on a DDOS attack on DF?
[4:38:24] KhetumTV: @Awikan fastest is following the 3 hours leveling guide that was released recently, but i'd say 38-60 is fine on invasions too

[4:38:28] Hupu_a: i plan to go ham and level 4 chars before reset ;D

[4:39:18] smashwow: they basically said at the end of the post we're doing this so you don't feel rushed to lvl on monday before weekly reset
[4:39:20] LeDerpski: @Aquadriel That would be the next weekly reset
[4:39:24] Zilberg: It should work that way or people will lose their minds trying to level the first day and do all the Mythic0s before reset
[4:39:27] zeeAbe: @Kinghorn Yes, that is why they will not open until the weekly reset that happens on Tuesday in NA and Wednesday on EU. Basically like 12-24 hours after the expansion launches
[4:39:30] Clssck1338: they are removing all weekly lokcouts for launch day and mythics and other weekly stuff wont be available until after reset
[4:39:31] zysmos: these keys getting completely smashed
[4:39:40] Kneckt: The expansion comes out on Monday so yes the weekly reset would be the next day.
[4:39:40] Velanthos: yeah it opens the first full week, so tuesday reset right after launch. All they are doing is keeping people from rushing to level and get all the M0's done monday night
