Most big companies these days push for increased profits every quarter by sacrificing the long term viability of the company, because the CEOs making the decisions will get their golden parachutes in a few years and don't care what happens to the company after they leave.

[2:05:01] ravimatrixx: :-)
[2:05:07] deanbeo: My birthday is on Christmas

[2:06:48] Kneckt: entitlement
[2:06:50] 91Niki: @NiinjaSavage Yeah then I don't know. Unless you clicked on a link send in steam from a "friend" or something. The odd thing is, you can't just befriend someone and gift them a game on steam right away. So they have had access to your account for a bit

[2:09:00] 91Niki: @NiinjaSavage Not sure how they could hack it via friends. Unless you had to click something like a link?
[2:09:05] Sollice: How does someone sending you a gift in Steam steal your account...
[2:09:09] Celestia6: a Lillith card would be amazing
[2:09:13] bumpstock75: upper deck doesn't really advertise
[2:09:17] gdcotton: e-pack openings are good to reduce waste wise, but no where near as exciting

[3:40:50] cyrex172: @xxshadowariesxx i would honestly say classic
[3:40:57] Noshpan: If they're new to MMOs, I'd recommend retail.
[3:41:05] Nerendis: @trollinmyimp rofl?
[3:41:10] Screamnsteam: he said retails more forgiving lmfao
[3:41:11] marineboi1288: Did you down tindral last night?
[3:41:14] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Retail forr sure if new player
[3:41:16] trollinmyimp: for a new player...i think someone new would not care for classic wow
[3:41:24] xxshadowariesxx: Not new to most just wow itself
[3:41:31] Moiste: retail is a better game mechanically, classic is better for immersion and chill vibes
[3:41:33] Kaykerrs: BIS dagger for Les let's go
[3:41:33] xxshadowariesxx: Mmos*
[3:41:39] Noshpan: But if they have some MMO experience &/or played a lot of Korean MMOs, then classic is good to try

[4:00:59] Molvonos: I have booty gear on my hunter so far, dont wanna inflict that on the raid yet.
[4:01:31] zhr0: @Molvonos You'd probably do just fine, I believe in you
[4:01:38] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: You think you'll still get to that DM on the rogue?
[4:01:44] Molvonos: @zhr0 lol
[4:01:47] LeXieSterling: Well maybe they can contract with as a consultant. That way it wouldn't turn into a job.
[4:02:07] Tooyoo: that's the real issue, blizzard needs to market it in their Launcher
[4:02:08] LeXieSterling: Meet with them couple times a year.
[4:02:43] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: a good amount
[4:02:47] LeXieSterling: It's never to late
[4:02:52] trollinmyimp: Vecasue Blizz probably just licensed it out, got their money and probably make nothing more off of it
[4:03:01] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: wasn't in the quarterly advertising budget
[4:03:04] force_FMD: how many other streamers even know?  i dont hear many wow streamers talk about it, but you tbh
[4:03:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: imagine if you could use the wow token for blizzard balance to buy the card boxes
[4:03:34] bakerbaker019: do they have a hobby/retail or just one set
[4:03:46] bumpstock75: upper deck has dog cards
[4:03:56] Kaykerrs: yep
[4:04:05] jkitchin75: all the things
[4:04:16] trollinmyimp: Did upperdeck just license the stuff? If blizz has no involvement they won't spend advertising dollars for upper deck to make the money
[4:04:17] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[4:04:24] LeXieSterling: Do they make Olympic player  metal trading cards. It would be cool if they had to America Basketball teams that have won metals
[4:04:59] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: maybe they just sell the license for a flat amount
[4:05:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah probably got a flat amount and nothing from the sales
[4:05:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: so no need to advertise
[4:05:37] zhr0: first invite didn't work
[4:05:37] Osilon33: small indie company problems
[4:05:55] cyrex172: @trollinmyimp thats exactly why, upperdeck just rented the license
[4:05:58] Kaykerrs: hahaha molv
[4:06:12] Kaykerrs: zhro said invite didn't work
[4:06:46] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: the weeks before was good
[4:06:51] cyrex172: that was a brutal night, diablo was fire tho
[4:06:58] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Balance is dog
[4:07:05] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: bottom tier
[4:07:06] Tormac1129: I can go again on my paladin if you need dps, but let other people have prio
[4:07:09] trollinmyimp: @cyrex172 Yeah probably in their agreement that UD does all the marketing, not blizz. Maybe they don't see the ROI for spending marketing dollars. Might be no royalties either on licensing agreement.
[4:07:09] DropShotDrewster: looks like streamer advantage didnt work for this time for those boxes
[4:07:10] Jixxerrrr: I parse 90s in BFD
[4:07:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: my 3 boxes were all meh
[4:07:17] Kaykerrs: @Towelliee gotta reinvite zhro
[4:07:18] Jixxerrrr: as balance
[4:07:28] Maruika: yeah there is 2 balance druids to parse against
[4:07:34] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: it's probably the single worst dps spec
[4:07:45] cyrex172: @trollinmyimp if blizz had royalties u better believe theyd advertise lol
[4:08:17] SpilledMelk: Balance without moonkin is like Shadow Priest without shadowform
[4:08:24] Osilon33: towLfg  Les
[4:08:32] cyrex172: yeah
[4:08:36] cyrex172: zhro has it
[4:08:40] zhr0: Yeah I do
[4:08:47] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: hunter loot
[4:08:53] trollinmyimp: @cyrex172 yeah it was probably just a set payment for a specific licensing period. So Blizz has no financial interest any further. They got their money.
[4:08:57] akia03: melee hunter weapon
[4:09:02] cyrex172: les has it too?
[4:09:06] Tormac1129: give it to my paladin lol
