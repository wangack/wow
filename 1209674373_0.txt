[0:09:52] adiosfresh: towelliee stream wow again?
[0:12:13] iambunta: Is he here
[0:12:19] iambunta: Or is stream over
[0:12:37] GT_JamesATL: Stream just started
[0:13:13] iambunta: Ooo nice
[0:13:28] iambunta: You still play wow?
[0:14:00] GT_JamesATL: Me?  I don't really play.  Just like his streams.
[0:14:14] iambunta: Ahh okok I feel that
[0:14:33] GT_JamesATL: I play Everquest when I do play an MMO these days
[0:14:56] bantuatha: well hopefully 9.2 will have CGI cutscene ending, that's what I am hoping.
[0:15:13] iambunta: I used to play a lot sense I really started in legion but I’m hoping 9.2 will bring me back from this hiatus
[0:15:33] Arceptor: @bantuatha doubt it. SL has been a sad xpac so far. not even one narrative cgi cinematic
[0:15:43] iambunta: I’m hoping they make vengeance dh a beefy gigga Chad again
[0:16:09] iambunta: Used to dominate raids running that class
[0:16:11] Arceptor: i really thought they had set a new thing to move forward with, the cgi cinematics but nope
[0:16:30] bantuatha: i wonder what's next, there is nothing new zone left in Azroth
[0:16:32] Arceptor: but nothing really happened this xpac to warrant them anyway
[0:16:35] GT_JamesATL: i mean at some point every game runs out of ideas to keep it fresh.  Maybe its at that point now.
[0:17:00] iambunta: I think we need class diversity more than anything. Like a full reset almost but you spec into classes like the Skyrim perk wheel
[0:17:07] Arceptor: legion was s tier xpac imo
[0:17:14] iambunta: Agreed
[0:17:17] Arceptor: also my first xpac
[0:17:19] bantuatha: only thing now is dragon isle are the only unexplored zone in Azrotzh
[0:17:22] iambunta: Same
[0:17:23] mandilozano: @ibunta_ dh are really good in mythic + and raids right now, which are the good things about shadowlands
[0:17:51] Arceptor: @bantuatha steve danuser will probably create some new lore and retcon a bunch of stuff to make it fit
[0:17:58] iambunta: Maybe even a full on apocalypse that forces us to a new world to recolinize
[0:18:08] iambunta: And that turns into wow two
[0:18:29] bantuatha: everyone wanted WoW 2
[0:18:34] Arceptor: i hope azeroth awakens as an evil titan corrupted by sargeras and cleaves azeroth and leads to wow 2
[0:18:43] iambunta: Same
[0:18:46] bantuatha: they said this is the end of book one

[0:18:56] Arceptor: nah he said its the end of one book
[0:18:58] Arceptor: of the saga
[0:19:15] iambunta: So everything until now it’s book one?
[0:19:25] Arceptor: nah sl is like a book of the saga
[0:19:25] iambunta: Like from classic
[0:19:31] iambunta: Ohhh
[0:19:33] iambunta: Lame
[0:19:47] Arceptor: i want the jailer to win
[0:19:50] bantuatha: is the titan ever gonna awaken since sargeras stabbed it?
[0:19:53] iambunta: Same
[0:20:01] mandilozano: i think thats bs, the "book" end would have been legion where we stopped Sargeras
[0:20:02] iambunta: Is the jailer even bad fr
[0:20:13] mandilozano: @ibunta_ yes

[0:44:28] Arceptor: looks like a derpy skull
[0:44:30] Rudric_Ice: looks so bad lmao
[0:44:33] mwchaos: dk looks pretty lame
[0:44:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: eh
[0:44:39] MrTerkyMan: Anti-Paladin
[0:44:45] Quesenek: Looks more like DH or Rogue armor
[0:44:51] akia03: looks like a court jester
[0:44:52] mandilozano: monk one looks good

[0:45:20] Gravelode: true
[0:45:21] MrTerkyMan: back to scuffed hunter sets
[0:45:25] Fleymour: hunter could be a druid too @Towelliee
[0:45:33] Quesenek: Helm and shoulders look good
[0:45:37] lucktight: how many tier kits are there?
[0:46:06] Arceptor: warlock looks like...
[0:46:11] Arceptor: DansGame
[0:46:16] Vadagar1: Monks got that Shredder Mask going on
[0:46:17] Rudric_Ice: give em a monk hat
[0:46:17] adiosfresh: shaman ftw
[0:46:18] Daggerstry: Hunters have yet to get a good looking tier set
[0:46:36] SaltyArtra: These arent class themed. They are raid/zone themed and thats fine I guess, but to call these class sets is insulting.
[0:46:46] mandilozano: @Daggerstry SoD mail set looks good
[0:46:47] Rudric_Ice: @daggerstry  nighthold Hunter set looks good
[0:46:48] mwchaos: yeah kinda
[0:46:58] bonkyouded: paladin set is soo siick
[0:47:01] Quesenek: Judgement meets firelands
[0:47:02] Fleymour: legion helmet kinda
[0:47:05] Xsilentghost: pog
[0:47:08] Daggerstry: @mandilozano @Rudi_Ice But compare them to the other sets of those tiers and they are dogshit
[0:47:31] Daggerstry: Rogue is giving Ezio vibes
[0:47:34] Fleymour: priest could be fire mage LUL
[0:47:36] mandilozano: @Daggerstry what other set?
[0:47:54] MrTerkyMan: i love the rogue set
[0:47:55] mwchaos: the rogue set looks cool
[0:48:18] mandilozano: rogue is dope
[0:48:20] Fleymour: rogue helmet for every class
[0:48:20] bonkyouded: i think paladins is really good though
[0:48:40] lucktight: lol
[0:48:46] Demented7: Rogues with the MAny face god
[0:48:51] adiosfresh: thats racist
[0:48:52] rilsolo: lock helm from behind monkaS
[0:48:55] Quesenek: IMO shaman set looks better on zandalari troll in that initial showing of the sets
[0:49:01] Arceptor: looks like the
[0:49:05] Fleymour: warlock . or a priest ... or a KKK member LUL
[0:49:15] lucktight: lock helm from behind is the next blizzard publicity attack
[0:49:16] bakurathewolf: HAHAHAAHA
[0:49:17] y2vibe: Kkk warlock KEKW
[0:49:18] Keyastaron_: OH NOOOOO
[0:49:20] mandilozano: lock looks too much like a priest/mage
[0:49:27] iambunta: What’s with all the white
[0:49:29] Rudric_Ice: here's warlock without actually looking like a warlock
[0:49:37] Demented7: Melee priest
[0:49:38] Alaquane: steward costume
[0:49:41] Keyastaron_: this looks POG
[0:49:41] dinobille: these sets are absolute ass lol
[0:49:43] saints17137: not my warrior
[0:49:44] y2vibe: kkk lock xdddddddddd

[0:49:47] Alaquane: swolekin outfit
[0:49:47] Jamertamer: fianlly they got a bad set Kappa
[0:49:48] Fleymour: plate monk @Towelliee
[0:49:52] mwchaos: i actually dont mind it either
[0:49:53] Daggerstry: @mandilozano If you compare the hunter sets for SoD and Nighthold, it is very bland and boring compared to the others of their tier
[0:50:03] Arceptor: it would be cool if the helmet had a aura like the mythic antorus helmet
[0:50:06] kimball13A: yeaaa i feel like lock is missing a major issue....
[0:50:07] wetttnine: Transformers
[0:50:14] mistertootoo: Definitely skipped leg day.
[0:50:18] Weez_tv: warlock is gg wp go next
[0:50:21] adiosfresh: warlock is so wrong lol
[0:50:24] iambunta: This feels poorly done
[0:50:29] iambunta: Like rushed almost
[0:50:41] mandilozano: @Daggerstry oh, i dont think so, but everyone have their taste
[0:50:47] Ghostzapp3r: Shocked lock got through
[0:50:50] Arceptor: it should be blue not red
[0:50:51] Weemancod: i think the sets just look to similar
[0:50:54] Rudric_Ice: dk looks stupid
[0:50:55] jaacobjames: i main DH and im not a fan tbh idk why, doesnt feel very DH to me. just my opinion and im still gonna get it lol
[0:50:57] Weez_tv: HAHAHAHA
[0:50:59] Weemancod: no diferentiation between classes
[0:51:02] dinobille: the warlock one is getting changed for sure lol
[0:51:04] Jamertamer: lol
[0:51:05] bonkyouded: hunters and shammy are L this set though
[0:51:10] Demented7: Ea LUL
[0:51:11] kimball13A: wheres paly i didnt see
[0:51:25] Getiikku: Warlock looks like a Tent, ready for camping
[0:51:27] lintukellin: at least they tried XD
[0:51:34] jaacobjames: 100% agree, well said
[0:51:37] mandilozano: yep
[0:51:44] y2vibe: All those set are just same color
[0:51:47] SpoonManes: warlocks lookin like a grandmaster Kkona
[0:51:54] othraerir: i mean, you don't have to bother with them
[0:51:55] Luminous083: Boring sets tbh
[0:52:00] Rudric_Ice: that mage looks so bad
[0:52:02] kimball13A: oh i dont mind pally
[0:52:03] rilsolo: i dont mind the idea of using raid assets + class assets but man this is kinda rough
[0:52:08] jaacobjames: im a DH not a progenitor of the new zone lmao
[0:52:18] DrakeDuude: Shamans and warlocks look terrible
[0:52:23] mwchaos: they couldve done so much more on pally set
[0:52:24] Trignus: looks like shit
[0:52:28] dinobille: @rilsolo exactly
[0:52:31] iambunta: I’m saying it’s lazy
[0:52:48] akia03: but you can get the tie set from everyywhere so why make it look like the raid
[0:52:53] mandilozano: those daggers tho
[0:52:54] dinobille: i like the idea of raid themed sets but these are trash tier
[0:52:57] nothumbgamer_ttv: if they updated old tier sets maybe they wouldnt need to work on new transmog sets, some look awesome but so pixelated
[0:53:01] Demented7: Naw its uninspired like well done steak atpRtsd4
[0:53:15] bonkyouded: They need to add the 2-handed mawsown sword
[0:53:22] Weemancod: everything is the same dude lmao
[0:53:29] rilsolo: i think they nailed the gun for this raid, very much liked that one

[0:57:23] dinobille: right that skull was badass
[0:57:25] Runetailx: As big as the door behind you?
[0:57:34] nothumbgamer_ttv: @ibunta_ you can still transmog that
[0:57:43] iambunta: It isn’t the same
[0:57:48] rilsolo: thats caster shield
[0:58:20] rilsolo: would it? yea, will they do that? no FeelsBadMan
[0:58:45] Kisswani: monk staff ?

[1:00:03] arcanuss: what's the link?
[1:00:23] kyshen3: It looks like titan inspired gear. Progenitors = tians
[1:00:27] kyshen3: oops titans*
[1:00:36] Kisswani: towTinfoil
[1:00:59] kyshen3: Well i thought the titans made everything..
[1:01:07] kyshen3: But now the first ones and progenitors.. i dunno man
[1:01:17] mandilozano: only the names

[1:02:55] kyshen3: Towel, what do you think about the transmog store set?

[1:56:32] Kisswani: yeah
[1:56:55] KingSlayerYotam: the fight seems more like we protecting azeroth than actually fighting zoval, he's just annoyed with us
[1:57:20] Jomuse92: Human form of Azeroth BOOBA
[1:57:47] Kisswani: you think he'll use the sword ?
[1:58:52] JDsWorld: playing wow the day after an employee walk out.
[1:58:52] KingSlayerYotam: ctrl F
[1:59:09] kaeildk: @Towelliee CTRL+F Arthas
[1:59:17] sinlesssinner: like arthas
[1:59:26] Daggerstry: Inside Frostmourne!
[2:00:51] Xsilentghost: there is a theory from nobbel that the sepulcher is on azeroth
[2:00:56] Daggerstry: This combines so many aspects from past raids: LK, SoO, etc
[2:01:23] sinlesssinner: are Mythic difficutly abilities on there too? i am thinking if not, arthas might be a mythic only thing
[2:01:32] jeffnsteff2019: question is has there ever been a 3 tank boss fight in any raid

[2:15:56] Kromede: WoW Reborn
[2:16:48] FroeyTheMage: Unless removing the sword causes the world soul to completely bleed out?
[2:16:52] Kisswani: and then the tantacles of the gods stop the sowrd POGGERS
[2:16:53] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: wrap his chains around and pull it in deeep
[2:16:58] Daggerstry: 10.0 we get Azerite to heal more woons guys!
[2:17:06] Kisswani: the old gods *
[2:17:07] dracullus: if there is new revamp, it must be way bigger than Cata one, something like Outland -> Draenor in WoD
[2:17:11] feelu_: ta heal yer wooons
[2:17:13] KaisenSiru: Champions!
[2:17:18] Recording_on_the_grass: yay the grind
[2:17:19] dianthusnemo: oh... jeezzzz
[2:17:22] Skizzurp: but you gotta get azerite power in each covenant
[2:17:24] daththo_: heal de woons
[2:17:27] Djfarmville: It looks like sargeras stabbed azeroth as a last resort in the cutscene though
[2:17:33] Daggerstry: Towelliee would die if Magni comes back
[2:17:41] PlayKn1ght: we can chase OCH around the world while he leaves us behind again
[2:17:43] jeffnsteff2019: do u think azertoh will be no more and we have find a new world and home
[2:18:06] Kisswani: we are meat shields FeelsBadMan
[2:18:19] xxsargexx: azeroth might as well be given a form during or after the fight
[2:18:28] KingSlayerYotam: yea it doesnt feel like a boss fight, were just aiding something
[2:18:28] dianthusnemo: we all move to Argus ;)
[2:18:30] rilsolo: prepatch event
[2:18:31] joshizaurus: Jailer has other worldly powers and we just have to beat him down gang initiation style
[2:18:32] m3rk_zion: I wanna say that this is setting us up for Azeroth to wake up, sending us to go to the void lord plain for the next expansion
[2:18:39] cerebro_x1: happen to outworld
[2:18:41] Daggerstry: We hop on the ship that we somehow abandoned coming back from Argus?
[2:18:55] Djfarmville: To the vindicaar!
[2:19:05] rilsolo: count down maybe? like how khadgar teleported dalaran for legion xpac sat there channeling for 2 weeks or w/e
[2:19:27] necrodracottv: Blast off in gnome rockets to space we go
[2:19:27] medanmarko: Yoooooo! At the end of Shadowlands Azeroth exploded and we see it. Then some time travel happens and we are sent to the past to change it. Boom Wow Classic reborn and we go thru the expansion cycle again.
[2:19:32] notguiilty: if blizz wants it to happen they will find a way they dont really care for lore or common sense....Chromie just snaps and does an Avenger Endgame
[2:19:46] joshizaurus: Don't you think that it could set us up for Bronze Dragonflight to go back in time to try to prevent events leading up to Jailer destroying Azeroth
[2:19:54] ExiaFTW: Let's go Heat!
[2:19:57] notguiilty: i mean they already on that path
[2:20:09] Cartharon: maybe it is a slow death which take place until prepatch?
[2:20:12] dianthusnemo: this is where Keepers of Time come in - resets time and we can do it all again ;)
[2:20:16] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: but world soul doesn't need worls after it's born
[2:20:22] Kisswani: Chromie steps in
[2:20:33] Richton867: I really hope the next expansion is set in Westfall
[2:20:33] jeffnsteff2019: hell they can make a new world go  to
[2:20:38] Kisswani: KEKW
[2:20:56] notguiilty: can marvel sue for plagiarism?
[2:21:02] HawtPepperTuna: Chromie sending us back to classic?!?
[2:21:08] Kisswani: I wouln't mind a time jump instead of a cataclysm tbh
[2:21:19] notguiilty: i wish they would XD
[2:21:21] m3rk_zion: Come to think of it, the pre expansion event is going to be Azeroth waking up and god knows what other world souls to wake up creating a new pantheon?
[2:21:25] xxsargexx: @Furystrikez she sent us back once i dont wanna do it again Kappa
[2:21:27] KaisenSiru: monkaHmm
[2:21:40] notguiilty: maybe then we will get a thoroughly thought story
[2:21:41] Alaquane: chromie forwards us in time. and we're now in world of starcraft
[2:21:41] jeffnsteff2019: wow has alot of pop culture in it if you pay attention
[2:21:53] Kisswani: Man if they send us back to the war of the ancients I would lose my shit
[2:22:06] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: someones coming in with a ladder
[2:22:06] MrTerkyMan: He could rewrite reality where azeroth and everyone but us (cause magic) is bound to zovaal
[2:22:06] Skizzurp: they just ending the game. they retiring the frachise
[2:22:07] Panadol324: anduin kills jailer , tyralion becomes king end :P

[2:22:31] RavenARPG: millhouse manastorm inc
[2:22:35] Djfarmville: Wrathion
[2:22:36] joshizaurus: I could see Turalyon dropping a light beam hammer of dawn style
[2:22:39] notguiilty: @moonshadows83 pop culture reference is one thing and copying a movie script as an expansion story is another
[2:22:44] Press_Escape: Undertaker
[2:22:44] Panadol324: Panteon power rangers team incomming :D
[2:22:49] mrrazputin: And His Name Is John Cena !!!!!!
[2:22:50] ExiaFTW: Arthas is King of Lordaeron?
[2:22:56] xxsargexx: maybe they'll have magni discover a way through voodoo magic or azeroth tells em how azeroth can be born without destroying the world
[2:22:58] Kisswani: dont we already have an example of Broxigar going back in time already ?
[2:23:00] Maex: @Towelliee like steve danuser said it  what statted in wc3 ends here  and wc 3  is the story of arthas so has to end with him
[2:23:09] dianthusnemo: GAMON!

[2:24:03] kpo887: Cheer150
[2:24:18] cavers95: thought we killed nzoth?
[2:24:22] joshizaurus: Leeroy Jenkins leaves his simple life of making chicken to go two knuckles deep on the Jailer
[2:24:38] xxsargexx: @cavers95 yshaarj was killed and look how that turned out for pandaria
[2:24:51] notguiilty: I lowkey dont think Blizz even knows whats next....

[2:26:39] m3rk_zion: Oh god.... Azeroth waking up.... taking the sword out of the world going to bat with Zovaal
[2:27:16] jeffnsteff2019: what if zoval fight altered time
[2:27:16] m3rk_zion: That would be ironic, and a fight for the ages lol
[2:27:23] jeffnsteff2019: since its a cosmic fight
[2:27:53] brodycanuck: Must be near Azeroth if hes going for its soul
[2:28:06] m3rk_zion: What if Azeroth wakes up and kills the jailer... which she then creates a new pantheon....
[2:28:17] sinlesssinner: hows about the freaking BLADE inside of azeroth? lol when we taking that shit out of her
[2:28:24] rilsolo: they really shouldn't

[2:29:04] jeffnsteff2019: #keepitreal dont spoil fight or cinematics keep in locked up in chasity belt
[2:29:15] dracullus: hell, I even think it should go to heroic/normal only after world first mythic is done
[2:29:22] dracullus: make it an event
[2:29:40] m3rk_zion: lol and before we go back to look into the sword... and it's already half way dismantled because the goblin prince wanted the glory selling the pieces
[2:30:11] andrewexiled: didn't they not the test the final phase of a fight in legion or something? or am i misremembering?

[2:30:51] m3rk_zion: @Biby07 that just made me slightly throw up in my mouth lol
[2:31:05] brodycanuck: What if Argus the unmakers soul got into the jailers body and took it over? People said before that Argus' soul is what broke it all
