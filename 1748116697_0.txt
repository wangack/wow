[0:01:39] PotbellyGoat: Should be DIII new season
[0:01:58] shinamoku: D3 new season started today
[0:02:12] shinamoku: D4 isn’t released yet
[0:02:19] erzy88: Read they pushed a new update to make it more like d4. I’m curious to see. Guess I know what I’m playing after work lol
[0:02:32] 0_0Dabs: ahh

[0:05:42] DunzoCD: in the waiting room for the D4 waiting room
[0:05:49] erzy88: Not sure…this will probs be the last season most people play. I still can’t believe console users can’t get thier pre order rewards before release for d3
[0:05:52] Tendeyaloran: this isn't world of warcraft Kappa
[0:06:00] nitemare34godd: towLets fuckkng gooo
[0:06:06] PotbellyGoat: Paladin would make sense
[0:06:40] erzy88: Hard to put wow aside lol. Yeah… I was gonna guess crusader too for him.
[0:08:02] PotbellyGoat: I forgot what the class was called in Diablo
[0:08:38] Molvonos: Crusader
[0:09:36] Molvonos: Its a shame they didn't put Crusader in D4, but it might be an expansion/DLC feature down the line.
[0:10:26] erzy88: The Druid addition was cool though.
[0:11:20] Vipervenom2u: I really want to play druid
[0:12:27] Xenial70: is everyone going to start a necro first?
[0:13:04] Vipervenom2u: thats the recommendation to level 18
[0:13:37] Molvonos: What
[0:13:58] Molvonos: I don't understand.  Why would everyone start necro?
[0:14:15] Molvonos: I mean, I enjoy necro, only class I play, but I don't understand why everyone would.
[0:14:16] Prevention6: I forgot they were still doing D3 seasons
[0:14:21] Vipervenom2u: So nerco has really strong starting abilities. For big groups
[0:14:25] Molvonos: This is the last season, supposedly
[0:14:27] Tendeyaloran: is necro still op?
[0:14:40] erzy88: I played the Druid. It was fun. Some part were hard though.
[0:14:51] erzy88: Still on the fence about it.
[0:15:24] Vipervenom2u: I think im gonna go demon hunter for now. God dh is really strong
[0:16:10] erzy88: They are so squishy though in d3 in higher torments.

[0:16:12] Prevention6: @erzy88 wait did they add druid to D3 or are you talking about Diablo 4 play test that you did
[0:16:17] theSalute: :D
[0:16:25] erzy88: D4.
[0:16:31] Vipervenom2u: d4
[0:17:11] Vipervenom2u: Dh is squishy but this season like every class can hit gr150
[0:18:04] erzy88: Hmm.. maybe I’ll try one.  Still missing some the powers in the cube for them.
[0:18:40] Vipervenom2u: i think im gonna use the challenge rift bag
[0:19:45] Xenial70: I want to do an all nighter but will probably be out by midnight
