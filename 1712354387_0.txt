[0:52:55] khatZalasphere: co-op game design, or like add conditions if the tree is young (hard) or rotting (brittle)

[1:11:20] paxx6: its not forced if you dont play the game
[1:11:20] pulsje: @shakinbake8 yeah
[1:11:21] HelloErics: Open world PvP doesn't work the way it used to though. People aren't bad at video games anymore, everyone min-maxes. And that's why all these open world PvP MMOs fail.
[1:11:21] SupAustyn: people are crying that it's "forced" LMAO
[1:11:22] Fuzzy961: the best times were beating other players. but the worst times were getting ganked repeatedly by players... soooo
[1:11:24] WyllowAG: I think it depends. Do I like getting zerg ganked? No. If i like small scale open world PVP, hell yeah.

[1:11:31] reddevil_am: @reddevil_am LULW
[1:11:35] joyott: playing with other people is not pvp
[1:11:36] macmittens808: sea of thieves is a lot more fun than sea of friends

[1:12:28] ShockWave_GamingTv: Hey @shroud are you going to play Diablo 4 when it comes out or showcase it for us?
[1:12:30] z3phyr5: I like that
[1:12:32] PresumedComa: azuregos vibes
[1:12:33] Tragona: LEROYYYYYY JENKINS
[1:12:33] 0vishnu007: Shroud try out the game SHATTERLINE, U WILL LOVE IT
[1:12:37] rato_de_esgoto88: But pvp is only fun at controlled scales, look at asmon raids in org on faerlina they had bizarre amount of players pure chaos and lag @shroud
[1:12:38] tamtakos01: lineage use to do this
[1:12:44] Throndax: much more player to player interaction
[1:12:48] iiiTzMikey: @shroud I think you missed a phone call!!!!
[1:12:48] Fuzzy961: the problem is faction balance on servers. When its 90/10 and you don't have a good guild or even players.
[1:12:50] inzaghii_iii: thats the best exp u can get from mmorpgh
[1:12:51] okNate: that opens up inter-guild diplomacy.  hire other guild(s) to fend off enemy players while yoru guild kills the boss
[1:12:51] Midnightf0x: or you can have strong guilds that gate keep entire server
[1:12:52] khatZalasphere: It's like tetris99 group mode
[1:12:52] steevwtf: EXACTLY, but people just want easy rewards and dopamine hits without being challeneged
[1:12:55] clinick_: Nah thats ass
[1:13:00] z3phyr5: even stream snipers would be a whole community
[1:13:02] a8neru: @shroud sounds like albion online
[1:13:04] Yunnerd: what was that one desert mmo where you build the walkers? it became unplayable when super guilds just dominated a server

[1:13:11] Prochilles: those players will be banned for stream sniping
[1:13:12] zev319: ya tru, its only "fun" when its even, not like wow servers that are 99/1 lol
[1:13:12] coldastop: based
[1:13:12] m4strpiece: go play albion online
[1:13:13] hossfierro: Aka New World........ :(
[1:13:14] razorl1ft: because there in not the MMO aspect anymore in MMORPG genre thats why
[1:13:16] hejhula123: !dpi

[1:13:17] CADZtv: @shroud time is the factor
[1:13:18] sposauc: people who havent played a lot of pvp talk about pvp too much shroud
[1:13:19] khatZalasphere: that is exactly like how Tetris99 group mode...
[1:13:20] xMadJester: @steevwtf And they talk like clicking nodes 8 hours a day isn't try harding LUL
[1:13:22] Exusprime: @stikfigure77 absolutely loved Dark Zone. your dancing people who signed up to be there
[1:13:22] Tueur562: don't think the current gamer can handle that lol. They will all just join the largest group. Or schedule it.
[1:13:22] Madkiller92: but what about the small guild they are not gonna be able to do the bosses and defend as well
[1:13:23] ScottSmiley: risk and reward
[1:13:25] cannabiscuresall: Ninja looters on wow world bosses ü§£ü§£ü§£ every server had that guy
[1:13:27] wangchukn: ablion is shit game
[1:13:31] Alcarus1: Micromanaging security concerns is "thrilling"? HUHH
[1:13:32] Berzerk_Mode: dont do it log off
[1:13:33] rato_de_esgoto88: But pvp is only fun at controlled scales, look at asmon raids in org on faerlina they had bizarre amount of players pure chaos and lag @shroud
[1:13:34] Saint_o7: Sadge i dont wanna game
[1:13:34] Jmontast1c: In lineage2, the russians controlled everything sadge
[1:13:35] NAQ89: ppl dont know how to have fun, they have to run the meta or get kicked out
[1:13:37] tukreb: @steevwtf but easy rewards = fast game dying.
[1:13:38] violenthugger: Ready player one
[1:13:39] Fuzzy961: should hard limit faction limits on servers. keep it 50/50
[1:13:39] Midnightf0x: strong guilds will gate keep and implement tolls
[1:13:40] 0vishnu007: Shroud try out the game SHATTERLINE, U WILL LOVE IT
[1:13:44] Cyanerd: the new gen players are built dif and even though what you say is correct, times sure have changed :)

[1:13:45] NebulaWaffles: eso did that way it was huge
[1:13:52] 4RC_TV: people dont like gwtting excluded
[1:13:52] BeerCanSandwich: Making money through PVE? Is that what gaming is about now?
[1:13:59] BurningCrusader: KEKW
[1:14:02] matching_towels: As long as I can jump on randomly and participate
[1:14:08] tamtakos01: lineage 2 in 2006 was like that and it was great
[1:14:10] fpsdr0p: Ashes of Creation is never coming out....
[1:14:13] steevwtf: @tukreb and thats why modern MMOs are junk, ive lost interest tbh
[1:14:14] okNate: lol that's why you avoid the big streamer servers like the plague
[1:14:16] DoubleDose42: No one seems to be able to do decent netcode
[1:14:18] Chase5delta: @0vishnu007 ban this one man spammer
[1:14:26] pingoojoe: true
[1:14:27] z3phyr5: WoW set the standards for good MMO in the 2000's
[1:14:28] rato_de_esgoto88: 25x25 at most, more players than that gets scuffed on world bosses
[1:14:30] m0rris0n1106: but its still the one and only MMORPG :)
[1:14:31] xMadJester: Yeah
[1:14:33] BananaPrinceJoe: a game needs to be designed for mass pvp ..
[1:14:36] BurningCrusader: You aren't wrong
[1:14:37] xMadJester: Netcode gotta be good
[1:14:37] tukreb: @steevwtf yeah, me too
[1:14:40] Septroy: Ark ?
[1:14:47] BeastenBiscuits: Another problem is balancing new players coming in into an open PvP thing. If people are ahead of you you‚Äôre kinda fuck for the good areas

[1:15:14] okNate: @Luddzone there are systems in place to heeeeavily penalize gankers that'd do that.  i.e. bounty hunters coming after them.  As well as if they do it enough they become near full lootable when someone kills them
[1:15:17] m4strpiece: expecting the best out of game devs Clueless
[1:15:17] fpsdr0p: idk shroud I have super low hopes for Ashes....

[1:16:11] RichestWrld: @shroud dcuo did a good job the first few years with open world pvp they had something where u can turn your open world pvp on and off
[1:16:12] razorl1ft: to be honest dude even if AOC failed at least going to remind us how an MMORPG supposed to be thats my take
[1:16:16] Prochilles: open world isnt going to work in todays world where people who pvp a streamer or kill players at a WB are just going to get mass reported for stream sniping

[1:18:06] okNate: @steevwtf we used to collectively go to war with the gold farmers in vanilla wow at Tyr's hand.  The entire server, both factions.  would come together and slaughter them for hours on end
[1:18:06] xMadJester: Imagine creating big groups to kill bots LUL
[1:18:09] PPercivall: bots and RMT won't die whatever they do, they'll just find another way
[1:18:13] z3phyr5: shieet mmo's have to tackle persistent databases commerce systems community support metrics and customer service objects and other game systems. lol
[1:18:14] vivisect: Lost Ark was made for PC Bangs and had nearly zero anti-botting/cheats before global release. Very different than something like AoC.
[1:18:18] bonushua: what are your thoughts on ur hometown mississauga
[1:18:33] steevwtf: @okNate thats the shit i miss about classic, i still remember some of the open world wars we had when WoW 1st launched

[1:18:49] mezerx: true
[1:18:50] matching_towels: Ahh
[1:18:52] jayketo: @shroud. The internet says you are from Toronto but a little birdy told me you were from Sauga. Who's playing here, you or the internet?
[1:18:53] midknight266: bots will just full crack rocks tho
[1:18:57] ruijerds: @shroud Lost Ark just added Captcha in the game for bot prevention
[1:19:00] BananaPrinceJoe: farming will be so much harder as well
[1:19:02] Bakuano: Depends, because bots can also then just break ALL the rocks
[1:19:03] Fuzzy961: they'll figure it out...
[1:19:04] Shaggy2point0: you gotta do the graft to get your items I like that
[1:19:07] cyr3x_timo: you miss csgo?
[1:19:07] Cloudladder: Unless the data is actually available, then they'll read the memory and target the specific nodes.
[1:19:14] mallardmcduck: !dpi
[1:19:15] StreamElements: @mallardmcduck, Mike uses 400 DPI
[1:19:17] rato_de_esgoto88: literally just add a captcha to mine a node ez bot fix
[1:19:18] Alcarus1: Then you got bots getting everything
[1:19:19] Jmontast1c: We'll make a BOT PK guild
[1:19:21] hotshotqq: bots are still going to farm it
[1:19:23] Ayudado: you're only able to break rocks until you hit max lvl. problem solved
[1:19:24] frankdsp: cool system
[1:19:28] Mr_Colt_7: @PsyNytes do u mind whispering me whenever?
[1:19:28] m4strpiece: I can't wait to play ashes of bots widepeepoHappy
[1:19:29] Raein91: you have to do that too
[1:19:31] jayketo: GTA scamaz
[1:19:33] TheJugglar: Also, what they were saying about trees, where 2 people can loot a single tree
[1:19:34] Bakuano: @Cloudladder, you're suggesting hacks, most bots aren't hacking. thats a lot more work
[1:19:35] harleyirish: shroudYEP
[1:19:36] vivisect: Well, if they aren't putting the rewards server side instead of client side, then they would have wayyyyy worse problems.
[1:19:41] Ayudado: you have no gold until you reach max lvl. solved
[1:19:42] Jeyar: free lot pinghata
[1:19:44] SlytlyTilted: they just need to charge for the game and have good in game support with ability to ban
[1:19:45] AbilityUp: EZ
[1:19:46] Fearer2601: just farm the bots
[1:19:47] khatZalasphere: Is there is a stamina mechanic?
[1:19:50] tukreb: Like in real world MmmHmm
[1:19:51] Jmontast1c: haha kill bots and take their stuff... lol that sounds fun
[1:19:51] ScottSmiley: EZ
[1:19:51] AbelDenibus: Bots will know what's inside and just pick the valuable stones. Players will be left with the shitty ones.
[1:19:52] khatZalasphere: when gathering?
[1:19:52] verosityy: what class does shroud main
[1:19:53] rato_de_esgoto88: To mine you should solve a Captcha puzzle @shroud EZ
[1:19:55] MmmDabs: stop ayu
[1:19:56] z3phyr5: Pog a community that hunts bots
[1:19:58] cyr3x_timo: you miss CS?
[1:19:59] xMadJester: Open PvP allow players to take the bot problem into their own hands
[1:20:01] pixalie: @Alcarus1 it's gonna be pvp for farming
[1:20:03] Prochilles: oh no.... full loot pvp???
[1:20:03] macklin2001: bot hunting guild anyone?
[1:20:04] HaadKhor: oh yea farm bots lets go
[1:20:05] Dextr0usSafe: Another way to battle botting is making games not free to play :)
[1:20:05] Jaeberwok: is anything instanced in AoC?
[1:20:06] devilkin20: Where have we come to, farming bots instead @shroud LUL
[1:20:08] Fuzzy961: this is like the classic 'crime vs cops' problem. By the time one implements a new thing, the other figures it out
[1:20:09] batisi309: unless the bot can fight back with the ultimate strats
[1:20:10] Cyanerd: i feel most normal players dont even recognize what bots are
[1:20:14] thacizz: Looks like red ded
[1:20:14] cyr3x_timo: you miss counterstrike?
[1:20:18] Alcarus1: Bots will always adapt
[1:20:25] GianNaMalakas: gachiBASS
[1:20:25] nucombo: @shroud wouldn't that be just like Lost Ark with Chaos Dungeons, they would just snowball the accounts to the max and sell everything before ban except with nodes.
[1:20:27] dankmemes4u: HUHH
[1:20:27] z3phyr5: work smart not hard Bot Hunters. Problem solved itself in pvp xD.
[1:20:28] mezerx: gachi
[1:20:32] darkol33t: shroudY
[1:20:36] AbilityUp: HUHH
[1:20:45] aradiipsy: @cyr3x_timo hell no LUL
[1:20:47] smashem7: Yyy
[1:20:53] khatZalasphere: and also add a stamina option when gathering. Like how many giant trees can a person gather in a day
[1:20:53] cigsaftereat: Would you rather know how you die or know when you die?
[1:20:56] tidy_cats_marketing: ashes is a joke man, never gonna come out
[1:21:00] yalestream: i just buy wow tokens
[1:21:01] Kaawabanga: Guys whats ulduar? Wow???

[1:21:03] m4strpiece: @cigsaftereat both
[1:21:11] parthpj16: SeemsGood ResidentSleeper
[1:21:13] TheJugglar: I wonder if the inverse will be true as well. Imagine an area that no one touches that could respawn almost instantly.
[1:21:14] manogaming001: looks like good gameüëç
[1:21:20] Masteve: If u want another video @shroud Lazy Peons Every Upcoming MMORPG, from a few weeks ago Is good too! : )
[1:21:22] Dextr0usSafe: making games not free pretty much fixes the bot problem lol
[1:21:24] Vidrinath: @shroud maybe a pop-up question like 3+5=? to eliminate bots
[1:21:30] fpsdr0p: ashes is so ambitious that its going to fail imo
[1:21:37] cyr3x_timo: you got weired followers
[1:21:43] WcWillow: acting like its a bad thing they take their time to make sure the game is ready before release is braindead, every game that comes out nowadays is incomplete
[1:21:43] califamadness: the game thoes look very nice tho
[1:21:46] ShockWave_GamingTv: Lol üòÇ

[1:22:17] snow_vvvvv: but Duch has a plan
[1:22:19] mezerx: nodes can randomly spwan different ressources
[1:22:19] tidy_cats_marketing: I just feel like this game is way to overstuffed with all the things they take about.  every system is super complicated.  I just dont' see it seeing the light of day really
[1:22:19] pfos231: when he gonna play valorant ?
[1:22:21] cyr3x_timo: its your destiney

[1:22:42] ScottSmiley: LUL
[1:22:43] ttvabsolem: Super coooowl
[1:22:44] khatZalasphere: The thing about bot user's that the design in-game also has economy mechanics where Oversupply could lead to a lower value of the supply itself
[1:22:44] AuroraAkatsuki: hold on ima let you finish but this is a really nice rock
[1:22:46] z3phyr5: maybe he's tryna stop him from spoiling
[1:22:50] ShockWave_GamingTv: EleGiggle EleGiggle EleGiggle EleGiggle EleGiggle
[1:22:53] swift_twitchy: plant water simulator

[1:23:00] dankmemes4u: where's the gameplay?
[1:23:10] thacizz: A cool little iron deposit
[1:23:13] SPANKY3KX: SPANKY3KX subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months!

[1:23:26] bengalbroys: @itsmeglenn12 shroudWave
[1:23:32] insweep: what was left unsaid about watering plants?
[1:23:35] m4strpiece: yeah I work there
[1:23:39] Diamondead1: @xSebGrohl true, im not trying to defend it, but making an mmo is way harder than you might think
[1:23:39] frankdsp: like amazon nw LUL
[1:23:40] Jaeberwok: its SO refreshing
[1:23:41] rato_de_esgoto88: star citizen also does that...
[1:23:44] tdslater: ffxiv does that
[1:23:45] MageWrecker: i love that type of communication
[1:23:46] bataan: Unity
[1:23:46] xMadJester: I've only seen this in Final Fantasy 14 Live Letters
[1:23:49] dankmemes4u: gaming is so dead these days, little gems like this
[1:23:49] devilkin20: Baldurs Gate 3 does that on patches too
[1:23:50] Gronbar: like Road of Vostok
[1:23:52] m4strpiece: KKoooona

[1:24:01] SavageTarzan: FeelsStrongMan ?
[1:24:04] star_dweller101: ya no PR Lady
[1:24:04] xMadJester: YoshiP/Square does something similar
[1:24:05] m4strpiece: @Paapyna who?
[1:24:05] rato_de_esgoto88: star citizen does this for 10 years
[1:24:08] strikerxtreme: Larian studios does that too
[1:24:08] itsjawji: @bengalbroys shroudWave shroudLove
[1:24:10] Prochilles: Is that Valinor in the background????
[1:24:13] Gronbar: not that uncommon
[1:24:14] ShockWave_GamingTv: Transparency is the key
[1:24:15] GianNaMalakas: spoilers
[1:24:15] okNate: @insweep essentially surveying can allow you to gather info about various plants.  when they flourish, when is best timing to water, etc.  Probably helps with planting on plots perhaps
[1:24:16] energizedGG: EFT
[1:24:18] sebgrohl: @diamondead1 I know I've played them all but this one it's actually taking way too long
[1:24:18] thraenblod: he's the owner and funder as well
[1:24:19] Yakeet: leaking info to competitors
[1:24:20] Alcarus1: Sooo.... every game? LUL
[1:24:22] Rezzlyn: its refreshing to see
[1:24:25] mauhumor: o
[1:24:25] Skippymcbutterpants: @Chadeuu  there are like 8 examples in chat
[1:24:25] TeiTV: @shroud Star Citizen does it
[1:24:25] SavageTarzan: wolfaGiggle
[1:24:26] ellielover70: usually devs are bad at PR, that's a danger
[1:24:28] Jaeberwok: yeah, failing expectations could be bad
[1:24:30] Mawcuh: Hopefully The Day Before is decent.. Lookin forward to it
[1:24:31] hazmatstr: feel like warframe devstreams
[1:24:33] xMadJester: @shroud They've seen YoshiP have open communication like this and seen that it works well
[1:24:34] m4strpiece: @Skippymcbutterpants asked?
[1:24:39] nucombo: have u heard of Entropia Universe, they have this same survey idea, and they also had issues with bots being able to map the land and figure out where and what will give u what u need
[1:24:41] harleyirish: Open dialogue pog
[1:24:41] dankmemes4u: !size
[1:24:41] StreamElements: @dankmemes4u, shroudFC why would you want that in command form
[1:24:51] Skippymcbutterpants: @Skippymcbutterpants ya you did that is why i responded
[1:24:53] khatZalasphere: by experience that method also makes the studios get pressured to speed up cause there are also competitors aiming to release first
[1:24:58] m4strpiece: @Skippymcbutterpants who?
[1:25:05] Hyped808: KEKW
[1:25:07] missleman58: seems like a smaller dev group so yeah gonna be a lot of plans but not gonna be able to deliver a lot of it on time
[1:25:09] Ycrems: stop pausing
[1:25:16] HYOTAMElol: btw are you going to play blue protocol?
[1:25:18] m4strpiece: OMEGALUL

[1:25:20] dankmemes4u: @Ycrems KEKW
[1:25:23] Prochilles: sun is aids
[1:25:23] StuffWithBudder: All the things I didn‚Äôt like while playing alpha one has pretty much been fixed/changed since which has given me even more faith in the devs
[1:25:23] brodycanuck: @Ycrems go watch it yourself if you dont like it
[1:25:27] m4strpiece: @Skippymcbutterpants yes
[1:25:34] insweep: @okNate thanks for elaborating SeemsGood
[1:25:37] neugassh: @missleman58 there is no time
[1:25:39] EnmityFervor: Additional pylons?? KEKW
[1:25:40] dankmemes4u: HUHH
[1:25:41] SavageTarzan: Pog
[1:25:43] itsLean: the gathering looks so good
[1:25:44] SLNTFocus: They had a stream where you could get beta keys for 24 hours, i watched for 6 hours straight and got one right at the exact moment my dog died so I missed it
[1:25:44] z3phyr5: I'm just wondering if their finances are in check. cuz updates and changes are always there.
[1:25:51] theredheadedpleb: game wioll never come out
[1:25:54] missleman58: @missleman58 wait are we in a universe where time is nonexistent?

[1:26:25] m4strpiece: @z3phyr5 they went bankrupt during covid
[1:26:26] ogF8L: lmao
[1:26:27] Alcarus1: Unless the surveyor is random, you could just memorize what is where or look at a community made map. What would be the point then
[1:26:28] knoxxc: LUL
[1:26:31] peepeepoopooou: XD
[1:26:31] z3phyr5: Good question bob :D
[1:26:32] ShockWave_GamingTv: Apple bushes

[1:26:34] peepeepoopooou: apple bush!
[1:26:35] Flysome_: $375 pre order game POGGERS
[1:26:42] xMadJester: I'm also so confused, apple don't grow on bushes
[1:26:42] RezaD438: scan area ?
[1:26:43] SLNTFocus: @SLNTFocus I know the odds were insane
[1:26:43] energizedGG: its a search area? like awareness
[1:26:43] dankmemes4u: mmm love dat apple bush
[1:26:44] sci_fix: shave the bush
[1:26:47] sir_lunchalot22: @z3phyr5 its funding-goals have been easily hit and the lead is paying from his own wallet, if needed
[1:26:48] shamorin: xp
[1:26:49] Paperduckling: Maybe it will tell you what ore is in the rock or somthing?
[1:26:53] z3phyr5: @z3phyr5 ouch I hope their wallets are healthy so they can make it possible.
[1:26:53] hexbone: im convinced this game is not coming out and its star citizen 2.0
[1:26:55] solumbrare: for player day one
[1:26:56] Cloudladder: roleplay service
[1:26:58] StuffWithBudder: The map is massive and is dynamic
[1:26:58] yalestream: @vF8Lv can you throw lightning with your hands
[1:26:59] pr0_killer2: chat this is not real life LUL
[1:27:03] ShockWave_GamingTv: Why don‚Äôt he just pick off apples from the bush lmao ü§£
[1:27:04] irohxoo: it will be randomly distributer - resources.
[1:27:08] pixalie: xp probably?
[1:27:09] HealthHzrd: Cant areas change based on how the server develops and stays developed?
[1:27:12] Bakuano: @shroud you're assuming its static
[1:27:16] Faucius: I wonder if bushes spawn randomly or something?
[1:27:18] Strudel_8P: isnt each server gona be different tho depending on node progression
[1:27:20] dankmemes4u: i will be the apple bush salesman in this game
[1:27:20] SLNTFocus: @HealthHzrd yeah they said that at one point
[1:27:21] m4strpiece: @z3phyr5 game releases 2032
[1:27:21] tMothh: It might be different every time it spawns or its just a perk and gives you more output from the stuff
[1:27:22] itzslinkyy: what are you playing today shroud
[1:27:26] Hyped808: @vF8Lv are you saying you cant? D:
[1:27:26] OldMan_Canuck: may be a mechanic you have to use survey tool prior to gathering
[1:27:26] frizzletoothy: what game we talking about?
[1:27:27] TheJugglar: Might be a way to see if resources have respawned?
[1:27:29] gingeeeeeeeeee: learn more get more?
[1:27:31] insweep: maybe to rely less on wikis while gaming
[1:27:34] frankdsp: dont think its random
[1:27:34] yalestream: @shroud if there is a nearby fire node the ground may not work anymore for some fruit
[1:27:36] ionic_storm: alt+tab is not a game mechanic
[1:27:38] thraenblod: they said there wont be any static resources
[1:27:41] irohxoo: they are not static resources are distributed RANDOMLY.
[1:27:43] pnutstv: might be personal knowledge so people can perform a task
[1:27:47] jay_hay: depends how frequently it is changing
[1:27:48] solumbrare: They might predict were node will be.
[1:27:48] Spirotta: maybe its an identifying mechanic where you dont know what you're looking at until you identify the object
[1:27:49] AZAAD__: a minimap ! Hello NW devs...
[1:27:50] SkinnaKid: dynamic seasons/nodes plus maybe stuff is skill locked
[1:27:54] thacizz: Whatever it is... I hope it has 2.0 in title
[1:27:55] SLNTFocus: Think of the map as a big node area and it can spawn anywhere in that zone
[1:27:57] Alcarus1: @ionic_storm Not for multiscreen enjoyers EZ
[1:27:57] Zenfar_: gatherables are random, you can survey the land to find them, swg had a similar system. Think of it like archaeology from wow LUL
[1:28:06] khatZalasphere: What if they also add a mechanic where certain gathering has risks like pests, similar to actual farming. and it can cause plague to other areas of gathering. This makes surveying useful for humans and bot preventive
[1:28:07] z3phyr5: its probably some feature they dont wanna release yet?
[1:28:08] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[1:28:09] ogF8L: maybe surving is for the 1st time?
[1:28:11] okNate: @shroud i look at it less what's specifically where all the time.  more gathering info on bushes that haven't bulbed yet and learning about harvest timings and such
[1:28:12] Stahly: surveying if you waste time on a rock right
[1:28:14] Faucius: Maybe it's like a "you know what you can see" type thing? Like x many nodes here of y type?
[1:28:18] ShockWave_GamingTv: You‚Äôre mind blown hahaha
[1:28:24] NotDiiZE: it's probably going to be like BDO, a small text that says what you are about to hit :D

[1:28:55] highfisch777: gonne be cool when this game comes out in 2032
[1:28:59] batisi309: devs talking about mechanics only means one thing, monetization. It used to mean cool game but not anymore.
[1:29:01] Shakeron: Whats ulduar?

[1:29:36] ellielover70: @3xpression we've seen it too many times
[1:29:41] CurdledKaeden: maybe its like "unkown" as a resource until you survey that area. like tarkov where you can't see in a backpack until you search it

[1:42:52] infantry_us: so when you making y our own game shroud
[1:42:54] zucroh: hard to balance when you can pick between 100% accuracy or 50%

[1:43:32] km_ttv: @TurtleTankGaming can u?
[1:43:45] StalkmaN: I mean this guy is right, is there a reason to ever pick action targeting if tab targeting is 100% accurate ??
[1:43:45] m4strpiece: widepeepoHappy
[1:43:45] ZorlIin: Broke up with my controller last year no regrets I‚Äôm a pc‚Äôer now sumG

[1:46:27] khatZalasphere: That's risky, yeah
[1:46:28] DannDastardly: @shroud The combat is exactly what Guild Wars 2 is. It's a mix of both some skills are tabbed some are action/skill shot based
[1:46:29] CocidiousMcBeth: @LordxSicc other than one faction could pill spam immortality :D
[1:46:32] paxx6: they should let me rts combat instead

[1:47:14] Jmontast1c: there you go, action combat with "aim assist" is nice
[1:47:22] ChubbyMikey: ESO alsoo just feels so floaty
[1:47:23] footslave_: New world is more action based
[1:47:25] Bibly1: if that's an argument then ESO has the fattest hitboxes in the world
[1:47:26] StalkmaN: @shroud this one guy is right I think, GW2 is better example

[1:50:09] z3phyr5: their node system is new so that is the hardest point. and their selling point
[1:50:10] LordxSicc: consignment system??
[1:50:10] neugassh: @shroud last update was some group content check it out
[1:50:12] Suthrnr: yea economy is gonna be a bitch, but FF14 has managed to create an amazing economy so it can be done
[1:50:12] SpeareOG: Twitch is dead?
[1:50:14] StalkmaN: Albion is doing it really good right ?
[1:50:18] ByuneFug: @x_xAKAGAMIx_x I believe they said it was going to be subscription with no box price
[1:50:20] 44kev44: make it like bdo... no gold trading allowed
[1:50:22] StalkmaN: They need to copy that
[1:50:31] springzor: @SpeareOG main page not loading for me either
[1:50:34] p0eun: but FF14 is cradled and gardened @Suthrnr its not open world
[1:50:35] Suthrnr: @StalkmaN albion too yea
[1:50:36] citrinesoan: <3 hey shroud
[1:50:37] josh2bjj: my psychic said id die within the next 24 hours if shroud doesnt twerk live on stream please shroud i dont wanna die ;(
[1:50:41] frankdsp: like poe?
[1:50:42] ogF8L: tradable econmy sounds actully cool
[1:50:43] Faders: irl economy lol\
[1:50:44] collyn: the players would just use something else as gold
[1:50:47] khatZalasphere: The economy is the hardest part when in game design.  Right now it's the hard designing those in the NFT Open world (not a fan but its hard)
[1:50:53] wbgguy: then items or weapons are the things that become RMT'd
[1:50:54] m4strpiece: @josh2bjj i'm sorry, goodbye widepeepoSad
[1:50:55] Suthrnr: @3xpression true, but I dont think theres anything properly comparable to the systems theyre gonna have here
[1:51:00] 4RC_TV: flea market economy ?
[1:51:01] spacemantiimmy: the most common item would replace gold and then itd still be odd
[1:51:01] mohamadnour0126: hi
[1:51:04] after_august_: 2 goats of a 6 iron ingots
[1:51:05] snowbanksmusic: trade toe pics for items
[1:51:06] kroyaltm: if they made the game @shroud they probably calculated there system to manage
[1:51:08] dgprods: diablo 2 became runes being currency.
[1:51:13] z3phyr5: Interesting take but I feel like players will naturally make a currency lol
[1:51:14] springzor: Twitch seems to be down, but the stream page is still up though
[1:51:15] wizzy__________: csgo keys
[1:51:19] CocidiousMcBeth: @shroud can always go like runescape and just have the server buy out or sell order to removed or make resorces to keep some type of ballance
[1:51:21] p0eun: thats why shroud is saying its going to be the most difficult @Suthrnr
[1:51:22] zev319: its going to be trees
[1:51:26] khatZalasphere: Supply and Demand should always be there especially with this detail in gathering system
[1:51:27] TripleR25: @shroud yo shroud you forgot to change the category. Its on just chatting
[1:51:29] Rtoru_: I guess that D2 players does
[1:51:29] mariuszenigma: omg not wow xd
[1:51:33] z3phyr5: KKomrade
[1:51:35] spacemantiimmy: its common for something to specifically become a currency
[1:51:42] laziest_snorlax: large guilds will hoard items and key areas which will kill early game
[1:51:45] dgprods: I would love for a system like diablo 2 trades to come back to life
[1:51:46] wbgguy: BDO does that to some degree
[1:51:47] z3phyr5: Here I trade 50 shells for 15 lumber
[1:51:49] ogF8L: what about the crafting system?
[1:51:49] exthemage: World of Soviet Union
[1:51:51] kroyaltm: I'm a hardcore destiny 2 player
[1:51:52] LordxSicc: crafting and merchant lvl ups
[1:51:53] miguel_ptm: yep Twitch is with problems
[1:52:00] Suthrnr: @3xpression and I 100% agree but gaming companies have been bringing on really good economists, Im just saying it can be done even despite all this complexity
[1:52:02] khatZalasphere: The cost will always depend on the user's activity and location cause they have certain items in certail seasons and location
[1:52:08] miguel_ptm: i try open a new tab and i cant
[1:52:10] Alcarus1: KKonaW üí¢ that's not free market
[1:52:11] z3phyr5: @exthemage  KKomrade
[1:52:12] collyn: @shroud thats literally how currency was made irl
[1:52:12] khatZalasphere: or should depend""
[1:52:24] frankdsp: u cannot fight the community as a dev LUL
[1:52:28] dgprods: let's barter!! haha
[1:52:29] xxfierythund: @shroud since its not happening now can u say who was gonna be on ur team with timmy
[1:52:33] imMikeyAngelo: Everyone is ironman mode
[1:52:41] citrinesoan: good deals like the regular trading system?
[1:52:55] ramb0_: is twitch dead
[1:52:57] citrinesoan: or are we talking about gaming system???
[1:52:58] Alcarus1: me :)
[1:52:58] ogF8L: i just want the combat and game to run great SeemsGood
[1:53:00] StalkmaN: They need to have a system like Albion where items can break or something, so you always have endless crafting/looting. And then that goes into self balancing cycle
[1:53:01] ramb0_: for any1 else
[1:53:07] amadrob: are you going to try next year?
[1:53:08] gorplul: what are you most excited about with AoC? @shroud
[1:53:14] lechonki: Sadge wouldve been so fun
[1:53:23] bengalbroys: @ramb0_ it said stream went offline/online but still works for me
[1:53:34] Alcarus1: DESPAIR
[1:53:35] p0eun: oh man, that squad would have been ill low key
[1:53:41] ramb0_: @bengalbroys i tried opening twitch in a new tab and its just not loading at all
[1:53:43] shureiny: Immersion, Flow
[1:53:45] paxx6: new world felt like that for ahwhile
[1:53:50] amadrob: Albion has a really great system to manage the economy
[1:53:51] 4RC_TV: im exited to get lost on the sea
[1:53:51] bengalbroys: @ramb0_ yeah I'm not refreshing because its working for me
[1:53:53] p0eun: shroud, timmy, tarik, subroza,. +1. W team
[1:53:53] khatZalasphere: SAME, No man sky makes me feel that way
[1:53:54] Totteman: new world def was like that for a while
[1:53:56] coldastop: NODDERS
[1:53:57] gaszer: osrs
[1:53:59] dgprods: I think we all just want that FEEL GOOD good game feeling again
[1:53:59] Alcarus1: DESPAIR to escape the real world

[1:54:20] dankmemes4u: Sadge
[1:54:21] 5ebMB: Ohhh you mean Elden Ring @shroud
[1:54:22] josh2bjj: the scale of wow was mind blowing to me
[1:54:22] Lrg_46: I couldn‚Äôt believe the scope of WoW when it came out
[1:54:24] springzor: WoW for most i guess
[1:54:25] pezzz69: so facts
[1:54:26] z3phyr5: @z3phyr5  peepoSad  Clap me too man
[1:54:30] bataan: Then there's Dofus 2
[1:54:30] tukreb: MineCraft
[1:54:33] ScottSmiley: the illusion is lost most of the time these days
[1:54:38] pezzz69: its all the same thing games now
[1:54:38] springzor: it was the first game with decent graphics and massive multiplayer
[1:54:40] kroyaltm: @shroud big games are coming trust me, covid fucked alot of production
[1:54:41] munko: i had that with Dark Age of Camelot
[1:54:42] BluelightCT: o7
[1:54:42] Fourgiants: real
[1:54:42] leeozilla: FF Its insane. i give my heart for FFXIV
[1:54:43] StalkmaN: Shroud needs to see some video on how economy works in Albion, I think that's the best system I have heard of in a sense of self balancing
[1:54:44] p0eun: ff14 was way too cookie cutter and copy/pasta. literally the game in every server, at every level scale.
[1:54:47] Plot_C: far cry 2 was good at that
[1:54:52] HaadKhor: BDO was it for my but the enhancing killed it for me
[1:54:56] drizz_: Think of all the possibilities with the power of micro transactions
[1:54:57] exthemage: It's a thin curtain covering monetization
[1:54:57] paxx6: zones in games use to be dangerous which made the world more interesting
[1:55:03] Jmontast1c: MMOs also shouldn't feel like a job...
[1:55:05] casian518: albion online can do tho but still missing something
[1:55:10] divinescout777: KEKW
[1:55:11] StalkmaN: So a live and long living world
[1:55:18] shureiny: Enhancing in BDO can countered by grinding the currency
[1:55:21] th3_ficho: i never liked wow but dragonflight really dragged me in , its so good ,and im  liking it so far
[1:55:36] HealthyLudoManiac: text mmos are so cool. nwnwwssd;kill monster;rest;drink waterbag;eat bread

[1:55:42] springzor: @Jmontast1c but "the grind" is what MMO's are mostly about though
[1:55:43] ramb0_: that first mmo feel @shroud
[1:55:46] miguel_ptm: Archeage 2 with unreal engine 5 maybe is a good mmorpg
[1:55:50] ogF8L: rip lotr mmo that could have been great
[1:55:54] p0eun: the last game i played liek that was probably OG EverQuest @shroud
[1:56:07] z3phyr5: @StalkmaN if its alive can you kill it >:D. Community of sabotage that'd be a cool experience lol.
[1:56:10] Nisco3000: shroudDab
[1:56:15] Jmontast1c: @Jmontast1c "the grind" varies. dailys. quest. adventures. etc..
[1:56:16] Leo_xas: shroudDab
[1:56:19] hoodride: a lot of you didn't play Ultima Online back in the day and it shows.
[1:56:21] kalis96tv: Tarisland destroys Ashes of creation and Wow :D
[1:56:22] shureiny: Black Star Weapong PEN Level are quite the Expense, tho available once in a lifetime
[1:56:23] itsjawji: Twitch server back? Pog
[1:56:31] StalkmaN: There was some combat there
[1:56:34] leeozilla: i hate the fact this mmo remember new world
[1:56:38] shureiny: It's actually lot less expensive than enhancing
[1:56:39] bengalbroys: @itsmeglenn12 hamster wheel spinning
[1:56:41] m4strpiece: @hoodride I play mario kart
[1:56:43] 4RC_TV: @Jmontast1c yeah but before when the internet wasnt still no mand land you could also discover things
[1:56:46] Nisco3000: That town part looked like WOW

[1:56:52] takashi_ishida: Wow
[1:56:53] z3phyr5: o7
[1:56:55] takashi_ishida: is this the game?
[1:56:59] takashi_ishida: the graphic?
[1:57:00] AZAAD__: a bit clunky
[1:57:00] Nisco3000: ye
[1:57:01] takashi_ishida: damn
[1:57:05] AZAAD__: if u play NW that is
[1:57:05] 4RC_TV: quite clunky

[1:57:11] khatZalasphere: BibleThump <3
[1:57:14] josh2bjj: my gnome warlock solos all of them
[1:57:15] StalkmaN: Look interesting, looks a bit like New World, i a good way
[1:57:19] m4strpiece: this looks like escape from tarkov!
[1:57:19] gorplul: i believe this world will be filled with things to be immersed in, something out of an mmo that hasnt been done in awhile @shroud
[1:57:20] gmpatton99: new WoW graphics look insane Pog
[1:57:23] khatZalasphere: Alpha Chad
[1:57:24] kroyaltm: the lighting is sick for abilities

[1:57:31] Nisco3000: Looks like rune escape 4K *vibes*
[1:57:32] AZAAD__: combat animation is very clunky
[1:57:35] takashi_ishida: its really good
[1:57:36] Crranberrry: its been in the making long enough it should look good
[1:57:37] neugassh: @shroud the day/night cycle is at the start

[1:57:48] neurogenesis: @shroud It feels like 'Ashes of Creation' is for MMORPgs what 'Stormgate' is to RTS right. Both are trying to revolutionize their genres.

[2:58:59] steevwtf: @Luddzone ya but if u didnt at least read a guide it just makes it harder on everyone that did
[2:59:05] ironrokk: did they add cars to this?
[2:59:33] Psomaster: Woo you got it
[2:59:41] AirzGamingTTV: did they change the boss or something
[2:59:45] Psomaster: This is a great attempt
[2:59:51] sheep420sheep: battle bots hitting a little different
[2:59:54] mortezasaedi: Hi bro
[3:00:06] Oreas27: monkaS its coming
[3:00:08] Psomaster: @roma4593 This is hard mode. Its got extra
[3:00:13] CamFN__: @Luddzone so should i play classic until i get good at the games general idea then switch?
[3:00:16] tekstyleso: monkaS halp
[3:00:18] ChubbyMikey: @Luddzone sorry for lateness, but no. I haven't raided since like 2008
[3:00:42] Psomaster: @hxprzzzz You mean to play retail?
[3:00:58] AirzGamingTTV: ah tyty
[3:01:01] CamFN__: ?
[3:01:14] CamFN__: i dont know what that means
[3:01:37] th3testor: SeemsGood
[3:01:47] Psomaster: @hxprzzzz There are two versions of the game. Subscribing to wow lets you play both versions. This one is the "old school" stuff, and retail is the new dragonflight expansion etc
[3:02:03] xPistolPete54: Never knew WoW had vehicles??
[3:02:11] CamFN__: ohh ok
[3:02:25] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[3:02:31] CamFN__: yeah im saying should i play classic till i get good
[3:02:36] syhkoe: @xPistolPete54 new ?
[3:02:39] naweedoo: Lets put it this way, vehicle raids were the worst thing in wow history
[3:02:47] grubratt: @hxprzzzz theyre completely different games dude lol
[3:02:52] Biddy_: this does look abit goofy
[3:02:54] ChubbyMikey: @hxprzzzz start with the version you plan to play the most, since skills and abilities even in a  single class have changed so much that you might as well only learn to play it one way
[3:02:57] grubratt: @naweedoo speak for yourself chief
[3:03:01] Psomaster: @hxprzzzz Regardless of which one you want to play, you get both basic accounts for 15$ US a month. Classic is so much different then retail. But its up to you. This is a bit harder so to speak as its all planned as its older content
[3:03:09] naweedoo: oh i am
[3:03:12] steevwtf: @hxprzzzz retail plays completely different than classic, play whichever one appeals to u more
[3:03:15] awolfe1234: StinkyGlitch

[5:31:08] OneHundredAPM: its all about how far everyone stays away from the rune of power so the rune of death doesnt spawn near it, lot of tank movement
[5:31:11] Quantum733: streamer why are you playing a game you enjoy? you should be catering to my interests
[5:31:14] gojheera: ulduar doesnt have heroics, and this boss doesnt have a hardmode technically

[5:34:14] DoDobrains: @diddle_phanny the amount of passive aggressive blaming that happens in pvp is much more i think
[5:34:20] Roonab: ranged should be in rune until just before death
[5:34:25] ShadyStoner: lot of complaining here in chat, they are working out the first attempt. Calmmmm folks lol

[5:34:59] doomed_jackass: @ShadyStoner We are living vicariously through their guild. Most of us know our Guild/Pug runs will be much worse.
[5:35:15] OneHundredAPM: yeah as soon as the blue rune goes down, we move the melee stack away from iit until the next death rune is baited away
[5:35:24] ShadyStoner: @doomed_jackass Very true :) Good luck in the attempts buddy!
[5:35:26] doomed_jackass: @ShadyStoner And first attempt, hitting HARD modes in Naxx gear, we can watch and comment

[5:36:57] ToxicNino: i get there are ppl in wrath that want to play certain things but warlock puts u over the limit ;(

[5:40:17] ShadyStoner: @ogsplashgods Just don't get discouraged right away, remember, it's still a grind. Super rewarding though if you find a group of people you want to challenge yourselves

[6:03:58] ThatArabGuy: hows the expansion homeboy?
[6:04:02] citrinesoan: <3 good job today with the boss HeyGuys
[6:04:05] ThatArabGuy: Worth resubscribing?
[6:04:05] parkerrxd: Is is possible to fully complete this game solo?
[6:04:07] bohan_: same
[6:04:20] citrinesoan: i saw it earlier.
[6:04:22] OneHundredAPM: mostly the same but damage is less on most everything
[6:04:24] osoi____: is this harder than mythic retail MmmHmm
[6:04:24] ogsplashgods: @parkerrxd depends on what you mean by complete
[6:04:47] Mogsor: chat, is wow worth getting into if you've never played it before?
[6:04:53] parkerrxd: @ogsplashgods I guess beat all of the bosses? Is there not one end accomplishment?
[6:04:59] GriftVvV: @Mogsor at this point, no
[6:05:09] DaCoook: aw yeahhhhh dacoooLOL dacoooLOL dacoooLOL dacoooLOL
[6:05:15] agenzmain: @Mogsor why not?
[6:05:16] zerotustra: it got cleared in 1 hour 17 mins. peopel spend way more on last mythic boss
[6:05:18] ChubbyMikey: if you enjoy this type of game, there is no such thing as too late
[6:05:35] danny_silk: @parkerrxd you can get to level cap solo just fine but no you're not doing raids solo
[6:05:44] ThatArabGuy: Never played wow back in the day. I played a lot in TBC classic and played some of the first phase of WOTLK but I got bored very quickly. I was not subbed for most of the phase. Wondering if phase 2 is gonna be the same
[6:05:46] OneHundredAPM: This is the best time to catchup your gear, but the leveling exp boost that lasted a month just ended a week ago
[6:05:49] DarkusNights: what makes em hard?
[6:05:55] parkerrxd: @danny_silk ahh okay thanks!
[6:05:58] DarkusNights: vs normal counterparts?
[6:06:01] sinful474: got my rusted protodrake cpl months pre cata
[6:06:31] bohan_: @Mogsor play classic imo
[6:06:39] zerotustra: @Thatarabguy p1 is super boring. period. I'm in the same boat. I really want to quit xd but maybe ulduar is worth
[6:06:41] sinful474: and they didn't remove the feat when Cata launched, every fkin clowns was using a rusted and the 25  cpl weeks into it
[6:06:43] ogsplashgods: @parkerrxd you can level to max level solo, or complete almost all of the quests solo, you can be a solo and join randoms to complete content, just depends on what you mean by beat the game
[6:06:49] Chef_MDT2nd: hmmmm
[6:06:55] Shamrocktv: YEAAAAHHH
[6:07:10] ogsplashgods: @Mogsor leveling for the first time is worth it, even if you just mess around and explore
[6:07:37] ThatArabGuy: @zerotustra Amen, I did quit. I haven't been subbed in maybe a couple months. Wondering if I should shell out a month or nah for ulduar
[6:07:39] ThatArabGuy: Ill see!
[6:07:51] Mogsor: thanks for opinions everyone ! :D
[6:07:55] DaCoook: @ChubbyMikey can vouch, i stareted yesterday first time ever after nearly two decades of dissing on it cause cbf learning it; and i must say:   its funking gawjussssss Dacoolol

[6:08:07] DaCoook: dacoooLOL
[6:08:27] slapface33: damn hodir still throwing hands?
[6:08:43] ChubbyMikey: WoW is one of the handful of PC games I think everyone should play at least once
[6:08:44] ThatArabGuy: @zerotustra haha not sure what those are if u could elaborate
[6:09:01] iinfamous159: @ChubbyMikey agreed
[6:09:14] ogsplashgods: imagine running into Stormwind or Ironforge for the first time again as a noob AngelThump
[6:09:25] ThatArabGuy: I agree though, I had an absolute blast leveling for the first time. Everyone should experience that and then their first raid will also be very fun once max level
[6:09:28] ShockWave_GamingTv: Where did he go
[6:09:40] ChubbyMikey: WoW, CS, Half Life, Age of Empires 2, Diablo 2, CoD 4
[6:09:55] slapface33: I quit after 1 week of naxx, not running it again after vanilla lol. came back 2 weeks before ulduar and got up to 4250gs since everyone was already geared
[6:09:57] danny_silk: @ogsplashgods Org or undercity FTFY KEKW
[6:10:11] ShockWave_GamingTv: Dinner time for @shroud

[6:10:39] slapface33: @default_guy77 OWL2019Trace
[6:11:09] ChubbyMikey: @DaCoook the good thing about wow is that the levelling experience is a fairly comprehensive education on playing your class
[6:11:22] Kurvera: i like this strategy.. staring the boss down till he dies from fear of people standing in his boss room :)
[6:11:30] ThatArabGuy: except for some classes the leveling spec is not your raiding spec
[6:11:39] l337I: @MetaShock_ just cleared most the raid, normal is not that hard
[6:11:43] ThatArabGuy: Or even the spec you want to be, just a leveling spec

[6:12:56] MetaShock_: @MetaShock_ how long did it take ya? 10m or 25m
[6:13:00] ThatArabGuy: I think you have to unfortunately consider the classes in demand for raid teams. Some classes are in such low demand it would suck to level and not get a spot

[6:14:17] ogsplashgods: @ogsplashgods least shafted then?
[6:14:28] ThatArabGuy: unfortunately with all the time you have to invest in a single character, not putting any consideration into endgame could suck. Its nice to know the classes in demand you will always have a raid spot with as a noob

[6:22:37] felibelii: @chubbymikey wait csn you decide each Boss alone if you wanna do normal or hm? not once for entire raid
[6:23:18] ChubbyMikey: @DaCoook wasd is still the best movement binds, but make sure A and D are set to STRAFE and turn is unbound. Also, never back up, always strafe to one side to gain distance, since it's much faster
[6:23:34] DaCoook: @DaCoook i did figure this, but atm the default jst seems whack, cause im still getting used to it, but changing now, would be ideal also cause then i dont have to get used to new binds after getting better on the defaults if that makes sense

[7:00:38] ZeroXides: @majorchillax Nobody is butthurt over you buddy get over yourself you just have alot of people calling you dumb thats about it
[7:00:49] GriftVvV: @lmaodadisthatyou party frames on the top left, his dmg comes from the 1,2,3,5,R keys which go on CD when they're used, the actual boss mechanics are typically on timers
[7:01:06] bougeoisie: are they trying to kill them on hard mode or are they doing normal
[7:01:09] ShadyStoner: @BTiZZY_ @lmaodadisthatyou Once you are accustomed to gameplay, it becomes much easier to focus on your own things. The difficulty in this fight, is 30 people coordinating at the same time.
[7:01:11] Wolunqua: hello
[7:01:12] MajorChillax: what a clown mech run
[7:01:38] Mertzeyd: @ShadyStoner we are doin that with more than 30 in albion online everyday xd

[7:18:56] Contrarymoon7: but HS does more ST then cleave due to the added dmg, but hey if he wanna pad let him?
[7:18:58] GriftVvV: @steviemcintosh they dont trigger the global cd though? they're weapon swing modifiers

[7:30:42] GriftVvV: @Munch1616 this boss hard mode is which order you kill them.
[7:31:58] midwaymitesell: honest thoughts on the game shroudy?
[7:32:22] Surm_WT: classic is great in bursts, when you find yourself raid logging you know it's depleted it's course until new phase ;p
[7:32:35] DaCoook: curseforge or twitch for mods?
[7:32:48] Keplerdust: So Ulduar is very hard right?
[7:32:51] Surm_WT: @DaCoook get the curseforge stand-alone client, without overwolf

[7:35:37] Surm_WT: as a mage main i find it triggering not seeing any mages on details
[7:35:39] ExperiorGG: yo
[7:36:00] Surm_WT: @DaCoook if you already use overwolf then sure go ahead, but for most people it's just unnecessary bloatware

[7:43:40] Atp64: lifttt
[7:43:51] iaml0rdeyaya: your raid doesnt have enough dps for the push=/ you have to get sub 30-35 before first death to have a shot
[7:43:52] GriftVvV: @Lacrimosa96 not on hard mode, it's oneshotting tanks when the HM gets activated
[7:43:55] tactical_rage_quit: should have went 2/3 hard
[7:43:55] iaml0rdeyaya: we just progged it
[7:44:06] Lacrimosa96: ahhh. I'm stupid. sorry
