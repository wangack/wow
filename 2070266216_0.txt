[0:37:21] goodshtt: shinta also using so he's trying to explain @Minpojke
[0:37:23] ekunx: @toboYex no that was mouse turning
[0:37:32] ekunx: @goodshtt you again!
[0:38:02] goodshtt: @toboYex yep https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST2FmW1obh4
[0:38:02] Moobot: www.Twitter.com/Minpojke_ & https://www.instagram.com/jonandersson92/ and https://discord.gg/STTWtwwDet
[0:38:03] jamminlove: My take: its everytime he presses reflect, which means that keybind stops his movement. So he's moving with mouse or a key, and everytime he presses reflect, it stops
[0:38:06] Slimjim3010: link clip
[0:38:21] Minpojke: https://www.twitch.tv/dekel/clip/PoorInnocentBasenjiBloodTrail-5No7vBD9cY4rvzbO
[0:38:39] ekunx: did Fiftisent win his game?
[0:38:57] jamminlove: Imagine your move is w but shift w is something else, and reflect is shift A
[0:39:00] jamminlove: Giving you an example
[0:39:03] jamminlove: and if he's pressing w
[0:39:08] jamminlove: everytime u press reflect u stop for a bit
[0:39:14] ekunx: monkaW
[0:39:16] Kappaleee: go ask dekel about that in he's chat im sure you dont get banned Kappa
[0:39:27] gnominatorka5: any huge future news for classic
[0:39:34] jamminlove: @Minpojke
[0:39:40] Ezzx: @jamminlove this makes sense
[0:39:42] mwako: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST2FmW1obh4
[0:39:53] jamminlove: It's literally every single time he uses reflect, no-one will cheat reflect facing requirement
[0:39:59] Kappaleee: thats not SUS at all
[0:40:06] goodshtt: @mwako wazzup
[0:40:08] BroyWonder: wooting keyboard Kappa
[0:40:10] Twhitch: he had some pubic hairs under his mouse sensor for sure
[0:40:23] reggieface420: he presses his buttons extremely fast, maybe my boomer hands are too slow but it feels like hes pressing his abilities 10 times per global
[0:40:30] Ezzx: yeah watching it again with jammins take makes perfect sense actually
[0:40:54] Ezzx: some noccox3 in the system and u seeeend it
[0:40:58] mwako: @goodshtt yo :D
[0:41:18] ekunx: he'll respond with a swift perma
[0:41:19] ekunx: :)

[0:41:33] souljuhwitch: typical NA CHEATERS!!!
[0:41:39] souljuhwitch: (i'm NA btw)
[0:41:44] rayzerpls: wasup pojkemin
[0:41:46] jamminlove: Imagine your move is w but shift w is something else, and reflect is shift A If you're holding down W to walk straight, everytime you press reflect you will stop, because it'll be shift+w
[0:41:51] jamminlove: @Minpojke
[0:41:59] Twhitch: i mean he did admit he have scripts on his pc, but he just doesnt have to use them, but he could, but he wont
[0:42:01] Twhitch: so...
[0:42:03] hellners: there used to be these macros to stop you from using mangle when a clearcasting proc was up, maybe something like that
[0:42:09] hellners: they are suppose to be out of the game now

[0:42:14] Silveryzx__: @Minpojke thats biggest cap from jammin
[0:42:20] sephiro1234: whether or not its related to his reflect keybind or not, its obviously inhuman and theres at least AHK if not scripts involved
[0:42:33] jamminlove: I mean the opposite is believing dekel has a cheat that looks at the target you're reflecting
[0:42:33] jamminlove: ???
[0:42:39] reggieface420: @Twhitch why would someone who doesnt need scripts have scripts on their computer
[0:42:46] Twhitch: @reggieface420 exactly
[0:43:25] mwako: turaxy said there was cheat macros on AT that made warriors aim lock on the enemy targets
[0:43:30] toboYex: does seem like something which "helps" you to always face target idk
[0:43:32] jamminlove: @mwako There are
[0:43:40] omyomy1: S +D hold right click and spam left click . with cripling it looks like he is in place but he is moving a bit
[0:43:41] Slimjim3010: if ur hitting rotational buttons with middle finger surely everyone moves with mouse buttons then
[0:43:42] jamminlove: but 1. its obvious, you wouldn't use it as a streamer unless you wanna get caught insta
[0:43:46] jamminlove: 2. you wouldnt use it on reflect
[0:44:13] sephiro1234: @jamminlove its possible he has a script that is bugging out. a script to face the enemy. which would obviously be extremely useful, to always be facing your target, esp against feral.

[0:44:15] Silveryzx__: @toboYex would make sense playing against feral / rogue / warrior, majority of melees
[0:44:15] mwako: there are so many clips of warriors doing that aim lock thingy tho
[0:44:29] jamminlove: @sephiro1234 It's literally on his reflect bind
[0:44:57] jamminlove: @mwako Aimlock is so obvious when people go through them, it's robotic
[0:45:24] jamminlove: this is something bound to reflect
[0:45:29] sephiro1234: @jamminlove you could be right about his keybind situation. the movement is so rapid that it looks very suspect, regardless of his keybind situation.
[0:45:31] jamminlove: makes no sense imo but ye
[0:45:32] souljuhwitch: damn i miss hurley
[0:45:42] Slimjim3010: if you slow this clip down, it looks like he is strafing right every time he hits reflect
[0:45:43] jamminlove: @sephiro1234 He probably also uses AHK, which I do consider a cheat
[0:45:45] sephiro1234: do you think you could recreate movement that rapid? send a clip of you doing so
[0:46:07] Silveryzx__: #freetorsten
[0:46:10] jamminlove: How fast it was is related to AHK not the studder
[0:46:29] sephiro1234: oh, yeah well thats whats making it inhuman and a cheat
[0:46:33] sephiro1234: glad we agree that ahk is cheating
[0:47:18] Fiftyswen: but doesnt anyone think about the poor hands of warriors without ahk? They need to use it!
[0:47:20] Gatesxz: @souljuhwitch with the pink ponytails :D
[0:47:38] reggieface420: anything that presses buttons for you is cheating
[0:48:26] bajhheera: every warmaner is using ahk they even stream with it like its nothing
[0:48:33] bajhheera: most *
[0:48:52] reggieface420: deep wounds is just based on your weapon's damage, its not based on the hit you deal, so the deep wounds does full damage
[0:49:00] ekunx: fiftysent check? Peepo

[0:50:51] Slimjim3010: not sped up
[0:51:07] fingerboy___: @mwako hur gick det mot Mir häromdagen, hörde att det blev W
[0:51:20] Zevyn1312: Well, it's a 2 second clip and the hoj ticks down from 2 to 0...
[0:51:24] Zevyn1312: Doesnt seem speed up
[0:51:31] reggieface420: deep wounds is based on your weapon damage
[0:51:35] ekunx: @Zevyn1312 youtube doesn't operate with decimals
[0:51:38] reggieface420: the wotlk version is weird
[0:51:51] reggieface420: his weapon damage doesnt change when you wall so it keeps the same dmg
[0:52:02] zoegoTV: but it doesnt do that through disperce right?
[0:52:03] Zevyn1312: Okay, so it was speed up a max of 50% then @ekunx

[0:53:05] mwako: @fingerboy___ haha han sa att jag har downs för jag spelar stealth talents :D
[0:53:44] mwako: rogues scripting is so easy to realise compared to other classes
[0:54:00] dior_bifocals: D:
[0:54:03] Spottman: Feel like this clip is just left & right with strafe
[0:54:07] ekunx: is there a logic to why a bot would make that movement though
[0:54:10] grizzd0g: the ahk trying spamming why trying to move what it looks like
[0:54:22] luunomxd: @spottman agree
[0:54:25] mwako: spottman u can't be that fast
[0:54:25] dior_bifocals: no thats a script xd
[0:54:30] reggieface420: right now on SoD deep wounds is a mixture of classic/wotlk deep wounds and level 25 warriors could stack 1.5k deep wounds
[0:54:34] toboYex: I really cant understand how anyone can "defend" this movement pattern as "yeah i can just recreate this" but no one ever does
[0:54:35] reggieface420: its a little bit odd
[0:54:49] Slimjim3010: a lot of ppl have a strafe spam habit
[0:54:52] souljuhwitch: i feel like i've done that before pretty easily tbh
[0:54:52] zoegoTV: if you bind strafe to scrollwheele?
[0:54:54] Zero_Kelvin: but hes also moving, not standing in place
[0:54:55] souljuhwitch: on my shaman lol
[0:54:55] Spottman: @mwako u can i'm used to do that a lot as feral when i'm behind someone just as an habit
[0:54:56] Zevyn1312: you dont have strafe bound????????
[0:55:01] luunomxd: if u hold left click and spam right click
[0:55:03] reggieface420: it looks like hes pulling against someone trying to turn his mouse the wrong direction in that clip
[0:55:03] dior_bifocals: and why wouldnt he move like that morre?
[0:55:13] Draizn: nobody would spam strafe and spells at the same time
[0:55:15] Zevyn1312: how do you kill totems while moving
[0:55:18] dior_bifocals: he would move like that all the time then, its so obvious lol
[0:55:19] luunomxd: check it pojke
[0:55:21] Draizn: to look cool or idk
[0:55:22] pvelordtv: can only do this with backpadle rly
[0:55:24] luunomxd: hold left click
[0:55:26] luunomxd: and spam rightclick
[0:55:27] eddiezim: do you think hpal/aff is viable?
[0:55:30] luunomxd: while moving
[0:55:30] omyomy1: do it with the mouse
[0:55:33] omyomy1: you can
[0:55:35] Yormanqt: maybe u are too slow Kappa
[0:55:42] omyomy1: y
[0:55:58] Silveryzx__: you cant recreate it because you are not a bot
[0:56:09] dior_bifocals: ^^
[0:56:11] Zevyn1312: just wooting things...
[0:56:13] bajhheera: did i wall? best clip
[0:56:15] Zero_Kelvin: even if you could recreate it, who plays like that...
[0:56:17] zoegoTV: try binding to scroll
[0:56:19] reggieface420: why would you be doing this randomly in the middle of a game? it looks like something is trying to pull his character one way and hes fighting against it
[0:56:29] dior_bifocals: @Zero_Kelvin case and point
[0:56:29] Moobot: playlist !socialmedias !photosynthesis !covenant !legendaries !conduits !stats !discord !macros !ui !specs !restodruid !awc !armory
[0:56:33] ekunx: monkaW no Q-E
[0:56:49] omyomy1: strafe s and hold right click and spam left. but you would never do that in arena
[0:56:52] 1cebash: Any Q-W-E players in chat?!
[0:56:58] ekunx: @1cebash BatChest
[0:56:58] dior_bifocals: but would u be doing it in game? no shot
[0:57:09] Spottman: it's like rasel clip u can recreate it aswell it just looks weird on the camera
[0:57:26] goodshtt: @Spottman how?
[0:57:50] noteimoo: why are there no weird clips of pojke or avizura? always some warmane warrior
[0:57:50] typazahar: грязные вп, догщит комп
[0:58:01] dior_bifocals: dont forget, he has multiple clips off him doing shit he has proven himself he cant do. At what point do ppl stop defending it
[0:58:10] dior_bifocals: of*
[0:58:43] Spottman: @goodshtt with mouse u just hold ur mouse button it'll move ur char & camera u just need to spam it to perma face the guy it's just weird to do this way tho
[0:59:14] NoManele: looks like the script they used to have on warmane to "make themselves lag" so they can't be hit.
[0:59:43] ekunx: @dior_bifocals which other ones?
[0:59:51] dior_bifocals: stuns
[1:00:03] Apparentt: the icons you can choose from show you whats on the same category
[1:00:06] noteimoo: intercept drs with kidney i think
[1:00:09] Spottman: KS
[1:00:12] dior_bifocals: at the bottom
[1:00:15] ekunx: intercept is just under stuns I believe
[1:00:34] reggieface420: charge has no dr i believe
[1:00:38] reggieface420: but intercept does
[1:00:52] reggieface420: intercept is just on stun dr with all the other stuns
[1:00:54] ekunx: now it's always intercept
[1:01:29] goodshtt: @Spottman think nope
[1:01:36] luunomxd: he is slowed aswell
[1:01:39] luunomxd: it looks weirder with it
[1:01:42] luunomxd: so put walk
[1:02:03] omyomy1: pres S strafe and hold right click and spam left

[1:02:23] whitedust4: can u not bind it with mouse wheel up and down
[1:02:24] grizzd0g: my lock bot would do that shit all the time
[1:02:27] grizzd0g: its the script spamming lmaoi
[1:02:52] omyomy1: torsten one is sus

[1:02:55] ItsNoyzTv: ALOO Mr. Pojke and ALOO Chat How are u doing? :)
[1:02:59] jamminlove: its way simpler than that
[1:03:09] ahleedc: minpojke do you use any addon to look at totems and destroy?
[1:03:12] ahleedc: or you are on default?
[1:03:13] Zevyn1312: He's spamming strafe while ahking dispels
[1:03:18] jamminlove: walk -> hold e -> spam q
[1:03:30] jamminlove: hold your mouse right click
[1:03:31] souljuhwitch: razer naga to purge but tbh it's prob cheating i mean it is torsten
[1:03:35] ahleedc: ty brudda man
[1:03:41] omyomy1: the dakel one you can recreate it yourself with cripling + that proc maces also your feet smaler
[1:03:42] dior_bifocals: bro regardless if u can recreate or not. Any player worth a shit knows you wouldnt be doing it mid rated game while spamming other abilities. especially only sometimes, he would do it more if that was the case
[1:03:44] jamminlove: idk why he'd be doing it, but it's not difficult
[1:03:55] jamminlove: race to draenei
[1:04:00] jamminlove: for better comparison
[1:04:13] dior_bifocals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhZjXELHxbU here u go
[1:04:17] dior_bifocals: explain this one lol
[1:04:19] mwako: so he was doing that? but why
[1:04:21] mwako: lol
[1:04:27] souljuhwitch: hold right button down
[1:04:40] jamminlove: it does I
[1:04:43] Spottman: https://www.twitch.tv/minpojke/clip/CloudySuperAlpacaPoooound-r-QMwSj6WHRycHf-?filter=clips&rang=30d&range=7d&sort=time
[1:04:44] jamminlove: I can do it on my end
[1:04:47] jamminlove: just dk why he'd do it yea
[1:04:57] reggieface420: we need the cast of csi miami to recreate his movements while he is also actually playing the game at the same time tho
[1:05:05] luunomxd: its not that hard
[1:05:08] reggieface420: its kinda odd
[1:05:09] ekunx: the clip is useless while zoomed in anyway
[1:05:12] noteimoo: torsten movement is much faster and choppy
[1:05:14] demongodxtv: i dont think hes using his mouse his camera aint moving?
[1:05:22] mwako: it makes no sense to do that and spam purge/shock?
[1:05:27] dior_bifocals: no its not
[1:05:31] Kappaleee: totally normal nothing to see here
[1:05:38] jamminlove: yea I agree it's either AHK or a cheat
[1:05:38] dior_bifocals: hes cheatingg
[1:05:39] souljuhwitch: ive done that when im super sweating tbh
[1:05:39] luunomxd: yeah its kinda fast
[1:05:42] jamminlove: But the movement is doable
[1:05:48] jamminlove: or a bug* I guess
[1:05:52] Midnight74123: he's pressing strafe and mouse clicking foward
[1:05:55] omyomy1: ye you would never do that in that situation
[1:05:56] Urpalmax: I mean he plays with AHK so he probably has the APM
[1:05:57] souljuhwitch: i mean idk why you would do it lol
[1:06:04] Zevyn1312: I have dispels on my mouse that would be pretty effortless idk what his binds are like
[1:06:09] fortchx: not defending or denying anything… but what exactly is this cheat doing?
[1:06:14] mwako: he is just a god
[1:06:20] Urpalmax: I wonder if he plays with ahk on movement keys then it makes more sense @minpojke
[1:06:27] Superii1: the most obvious cheat
[1:06:27] Zevyn1312: It's hard to compare if you're seeing things through the lens of your own setup
[1:06:41] dank_thank: Well he has been using ahk so his fingers are well rested
[1:06:42] ThatSwoodGuy: script just auto aiming at enemy so it cant miss kick.
[1:06:50] ThatSwoodGuy: nothing to see there
[1:07:01] dior_bifocals: wait
[1:07:04] dior_bifocals: ffinish
[1:07:05] sephiro1234: @fortchx not functioning perfectly. revealing itself
[1:07:06] ekunx: @ThatSwoodGuy but you cant see that in the clip
[1:07:07] dior_bifocals: it shows him
[1:07:09] souljuhwitch: i mean they all do
[1:07:12] dior_bifocals: trryingg to press it
[1:07:21] Zevyn1312: Sheesh confirmed cheater ...
[1:07:29] 0ldfri3nd: I told my war friend to figure out how they cheat cause everyone cheats anyway
[1:07:31] fingerboy___: @jamminlove  so what is the conclusion about rasels movement of turning etc?
[1:07:33] mwako: it feels like they're using something else than ahk thats weird
[1:07:37] godreazy: why are u playing with a cheater then
[1:07:40] fingerboy___: bring in the judge, sledgehammer.
[1:07:44] Urpalmax: then you’re also playing with a cheater right now
[1:07:46] jamminlove: @fingerboy___ I personally dont think rasel cheats, but this is my opinion
[1:07:50] Urpalmax: THOUGHTS
[1:07:52] ekunx: @fingerboy___ you can see him using his own cursor to do it - movement scripts don't really do that
[1:08:00] zoegoTV: I know that topG spams hes keys alot when he streams, could be for show tho..
[1:08:15] dior_bifocals: but the second half @Minpojke shows himself and hes like "i can press those" he tries and its so bad lolol
[1:08:40] jamminlove: qwneer rasel are both legit warriors, the rest idk, I haven't seen anything that leads me to believe the others are cheating. Doesn't mean they aren't, I just havent been convinced
[1:08:42] mwako: even tho they're good doesn't mean they're not cheating look at chokopapa
[1:08:43] fingerboy___: @Minpojke didnt know if i missed out, but as Shinta is using AHK. What is your opinion about that ;)
[1:08:46] jamminlove: And I did this for a living on AT :D
[1:08:56] jamminlove: Shinta used to actually cheat
[1:08:56] Moobot: playlist !socialmedias !photosynthesis !covenant !legendaries !conduits !stats !discord !macros !ui !specs !restodruid !awc !armory
[1:09:01] jamminlove: one of the few actually proven
[1:09:06] Kappaleee: im not using :(
[1:09:08] souljuhwitch: lmao
[1:09:20] mwako: advanced rotation bot
[1:09:25] notmorbos: im pretty sure Kinovar and that James guy actually cheat. ive not felt heavy cheat on anyone else i faced
[1:09:28] fingerboy___: advanced rotation bot
[1:09:32] dior_bifocals: just ahk is different then that shit we are watching rn
[1:09:34] noteimoo: Qwneer also used to cheat
[1:09:37] noteimoo: he was known for it
[1:09:44] reggieface420: the idea that someone has a program pressing buttons for them on wow, running in the background isn't cheating is crazy to me
[1:09:45] utbiu: People always get mad when it is true
[1:09:50] BOBHYPE: I checked Hurley's folder and can confirm it's clean. Alot of Hentai though but no ahk
[1:09:55] razoraus: cheating... cheating on Warmane
[1:10:06] utbiu: Shinta cheating confirmed
[1:10:06] simplyod13: @BOBHYPE LUL LUL LUL
[1:10:08] souljuhwitch: if you didn't cheat being accused would be a compliment right
[1:10:12] souljuhwitch: becuase you're so good
[1:10:18] jamminlove: If Im not cheating and u call me a cheater I dont get mad, I take the compliment (in cs)
[1:10:23] jamminlove: ye
[1:10:25] Moobot:  Thanks for subbing, @BOBHYPE <3
[1:10:29] dior_bifocals: what if they are tired of being falsely accused? im sure thats more rare but never know
[1:10:30] ekunx: @reggieface420 you can't define it like that. there's a difference between AHK where you show it which button to continue pressing, or a program that literally chooses which buttons to press for you autonomously
[1:10:35] ekunx: :)
[1:10:37] BOBHYPE: BOBHYPE subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 3 month streak! xd
[1:10:40] reggieface420: they are both cheating
[1:10:41] jamminlove: 1v1 me
[1:10:47] jamminlove: lol
[1:10:49] souljuhwitch: LOL
[1:10:51] zoegoTV: when did shinta get caught @jamminlove  ?
[1:10:52] jamminlove: 100 euros?
[1:10:54] jamminlove: 1000?
[1:10:57] reggieface420: having a program spamming a button for you is cheating
[1:11:00] ekunx: @reggieface420 yes but you can't put them both under that term
[1:11:02] reggieface420: that's my opinion
[1:11:17] sephiro1234: @ekunx theyre both cheating obviously, one is just worse
[1:11:31] ekunx: @sephiro1234 i wasn't saying they weren't
[1:11:34] sephiro1234: @ekunx yes you can put them both under the same term.
[1:11:39] mwako: jammin thats not how u do it, u say first round no money involved and u lose on purpose then u do 100 euro round and u shit on him BloodTrail
[1:11:42] Zevyn1312: @reggieface420 glad Blizzard has more sense than you then and added it to retail (poorly)
[1:11:58] fingerboy___: well as someone in the chat said and pojke as well. Ruskis always tend to cheat so accusing Kinowar+James for cheating would be a logical conclusion.
[1:12:09] sephiro1234: @ekunx  " yes but you can't put them both under that term"   <---- your message 30 seconds ago regarding ahk being "cheating"
[1:12:10] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream and the content? Consider supporting by Subscribing or Donating! This is what I do full-time and any amount is greatly appreciated but not expected. Subscribers also don't receive any ads!
[1:12:13] dior_bifocals: @sephiro1234 ahk if just for key press is the same as most modern keyboards, its to help carpal tunnel and isnt cheating in retail so idk
[1:12:28] ThatSwoodGuy: @ekunx Anything that puts you in advantage over the others is considered cheating.
[1:12:28] ekunx: @sephiro1234 heh, you're literally missing the whole point.
[1:12:38] 1337umad: its the same as holding backspace to delete
[1:12:39] ThatSwoodGuy: literally definition of cheating
[1:12:43] ekunx: @ThatSwoodGuy wasn't the point of my argument
[1:13:02] ekunx: and I agree wit hwhat you said
[1:13:03] Badabingpow: is my bis gear cheating @ThatSwoodGuy Kappa
[1:13:03] Kappaleee: cyrus is back
[1:13:07] jamminlove: @ThatSwoodGuy Not really, an addon or a macro can put you at an advantage, What makes it a cheat is that others can't use it or is readily available
[1:13:08] sephiro1234: @dior_bifocals it is against terms of service to extra key presses from 1 key press, look it up
[1:13:10] jamminlove: @Minpojke 1000 euros 1v1, bo5 map we agree or split choice 12 rounds
[1:13:10] Zevyn1312: @ThatSwoodGuy we should all play on 60hz monitors and dell keyboards on 56k because this one guy in bosnia does
[1:13:13] sephiro1234: @dior_bifocals therefore it is cheating
[1:13:25] dior_bifocals: @sephiro1234 is it? u press and hold
[1:13:31] jamminlove: I do
[1:13:35] dior_bifocals: still have to press buttons no?
[1:13:41] ThatSwoodGuy: @Badabingpow gear is within the game rules, so no
[1:13:45] shucoco: I just tuned in, can someone link the clip pls
[1:13:48] Silveryzx__: @Minpojke cheats are like 10€ / month, you make 990€ profit if you challenge him
[1:13:52] korleonexx: @jamminlove faceit elo? :D
[1:13:53] sephiro1234: @dior_bifocals you're getting extra inputs from a program
[1:13:56] mwako: he is that guy
[1:14:14] sephiro1234: @dior_bifocals whether that program is built into your keyboard or not doesnt matter, its against ToS
[1:14:21] jamminlove: Only after u answer
[1:14:36] jamminlove: brb
[1:14:38] dior_bifocals: @sephiro1234 why does retail allow it? and no one complains about rapid key press btw. just scripters
[1:14:59] sephiro1234: @dior_bifocals im telling you its against ToS, its just not enforced
[1:14:59] Moobot: www.Twitter.com/Minpojke_ & https://www.instagram.com/jonandersson92/ and https://discord.gg/STTWtwwDet
[1:15:25] shucoco: The supposed scripter
[1:15:26] sephiro1234: blizz didnt notice that there were kick macros that only kciked if your opponent was casting for years apparently so
[1:15:28] dior_bifocals: @sephiro1234 i know the rules my guy, just saying no one cares about that part
[1:15:33] reggieface420: ahk
[1:15:37] ekunx: Fiftysent check?
[1:15:49] ekunx: crap
[1:16:01] sephiro1234: @dior_bifocals "is it? u press and hold"  <---- your message from a few minutes ago regarding if AHK is cheating or not
[1:16:05] sephiro1234: so you apparently didnt know the rules
[1:16:26] Badabingpow: GL sire hope youre doing well @Minpojke
[1:16:30] pumpz3: razor has the same fuction with its components
[1:16:38] dior_bifocals: hahaha every keybaord does
[1:16:47] reggieface420: on wrath i believe 1 button press = 1 action, anything beyond that is cheating
[1:16:55] reggieface420: that's their tos
[1:17:07] 1337umad: does it really grants an advantage?
[1:17:07] Zevyn1312: Spam input and an auto-ground or anysort of automation is an insane comparison
[1:17:08] saubur: confirmed discord is cheating Kappa
[1:17:14] dior_bifocals: so u can cry about rapid key press but scripting should be your real concern :)
[1:17:26] thicchornx: I canceled my first case, so here I am for a lil while yee haw
[1:17:32] sephiro1234: yeah, everyone and their mom knows that its widespread and not enforced, but it is cheating
[1:17:35] dior_bifocals: @Zevyn1312 im saying bro
[1:17:44] sephiro1234: @dior_bifocals obviously scripting is worse, everyone knows that
[1:18:21] shucoco: Can anyone in chat link the clip you are discussing about?
[1:18:28] sephiro1234: this argument is the same as saying, dont worry about shoplifting from the gas station, only worry about grand theft auto. both are bad, one is 10X worse
[1:18:31] Spottman: HAHA
[1:18:33] jamminlove: LMAO
[1:18:34] thicchornx: They ate breakfast so I delayed them 6-8hrs. I’m sure I’ll have something else to do soon. also is that a Yankees hat?!?!

[1:22:23] emilyo97: cyrus
[1:22:24] korleonexx: I think blizz should make in the game an option to repeatedly execute buttons on keyhold instead of having this grey area about AHK and keyboard softwares, like what are they gonna do ban everyone with razer kb? No, so just include the function.
[1:22:36] Ezzx: syrus?cyrus? citrus???
[1:22:39] jamminlove: @korleonexx they did exactly that
[1:22:49] jamminlove: its currently in the game
[1:22:53] jamminlove: It's just shit :)
[1:23:05] WorriedAU: cyrus
[1:23:10] whitedust4: its miley

[1:23:17] zoegoTV: new soundclip inc?
[1:23:22] sephiro1234: @jamminlove really? whats it called
[1:23:28] korleonexx: @jamminlove big sadge, any hope for fix maybe?
[1:23:29] ekunx: i can't believe you answered "are you cyrus" to that guy who said "i've got work to do" earlier and you didn't know about the trailer park boys character
[1:23:33] souljuhwitch: i just realised he means serious lmao
[1:23:36] souljuhwitch: jfc
[1:23:58] souljuhwitch: sorry im a little slow
[1:24:07] emilyo97: wtf would he mean otherwise? xD
[1:24:27] jamminlove: @sephiro1234 "Press and Hold casting"
[1:24:33] Ezzx: @emilyo97 Maybe " Are you cyrus Anderson?"
[1:24:33] jamminlove: They added it in dragonflight
[1:24:55] sephiro1234: @jamminlove oh havent touched retail in ages. interesting
[1:25:03] jamminlove: If everyone has it, I wouldn't mind it @Minpojke
[1:25:06] korleonexx: @jamminlove doesnt that technically make them give their blessing to the use of options of the same function like AHK and the softwares?
[1:25:10] jamminlove: Except for dispels

[1:25:32] skylightxo: @Minpojke Have you read the new study proving nutrients are fake, and all you need is calories?
[1:25:42] jamminlove: @korleonexx The opposite, is so they can ban people with AHK without the acessability concerns of stopping players with issues from playing the game
[1:25:48] jamminlove: If there's an ingame option, u have no excuse
[1:25:52] jamminlove: I assume

[1:39:58] jamminlove: He trinkets before poly starts being cast

[1:40:44] fortchx: the one thing that annoys me with these people that throw allegations is that they always harp on about “0.1 reactions” and can’t comprehend that good players could possibly preempt these decisions
[1:41:25] Superii1: thing is if it is premeditated you should see these guys pummel alot of nothing also
[1:41:38] Superii1: when the expected action doesnt happen
[1:41:56] korleonexx: @Superii1 they probably are but theres no clips of this, its survivorship bias for the perfect pummel

[1:43:19] shucoco: Its a focus pummel when charging priest idk
[1:43:40] fortchx: @superii1 good point, I honestly have never watched dekel but I imagine he’s not pulling this shit off every single game without mistakes
[1:43:52] infrex1: How can Shinta be complaining when he's AHKing on stream
[1:43:58] fortchx: and if he is maybe he is just a robot
[1:44:36] shucoco: Yeah the turn is sus but
[1:44:58] Superii1: the turn makes absolutely no sense. That part is obviously some program
[1:45:19] GarrinchA: did smourne procc kill the pala?

[1:46:57] testestkappa: proof that na players are garbage, how can he not know that he could have just predicted the shep
[1:47:54] itslarsson9: Dekel has nice apm. 800+. He daily trains his fingers
[1:48:04] thicchornx: KEKW
[1:48:07] jamminlove: That's a bias
[1:48:11] mwako: but why warriors and not another class they're strong already with shadowmourne and they play the strongest comp in the game makes no sense to me
[1:48:17] jamminlove: There's a lot of cheaters banned since s5 you just dont know about them
[1:48:26] jamminlove: It'll sound like copium, its not
[1:48:30] Todd686: COPIUM
[1:48:45] jamminlove: cheaters
[1:48:52] noteimoo: how about that double rogue team that cheated for three seasons straight
[1:48:57] jamminlove: Like remember that rogue clip cheat with all the graphics and prediction
[1:48:57] mwako: there are still rogue scripters in dbl rogue
[1:49:01] shucoco: How do you not understand it? Its a high apm class
[1:49:03] ekunx: https://www.twitch.tv/dekel/clip/ClearZealousMoonOneHand-SC8wm4YMqjO26Pab?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time was just revisiting this clip to have a laugh, but then i noticed what novoz is doing while they're about to kill the enemy shaman
[1:49:05] jamminlove: when that clip got popular, everyone using it was already banned for it
[1:49:07] ekunx: every shaman is cheating!
[1:49:09] itslarsson9: Banned for iMorph guys peepoSad
[1:49:26] Fiskerz: @mwako play war and you will realize why. don’t agree with the cheating but after playin like 200 games on my war I’m already tired of spamming 123 LUL
[1:49:32] mwako: there is still one dbl rogue using scripts
[1:49:35] jamminlove: Again not saying they're catching all of them or that you cant cheat, just saying that "they do nothing" isn't right either
[1:49:38] ekunx: he's pressing a lot of strafe while purging
[1:49:39] ekunx: :)
[1:50:02] korleonexx: I wonder what happened to all those DK's struggling to enter Tempest Keep thinkge
