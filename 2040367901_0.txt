[1:38:29] playerpersonx: you're right, its within 10 hours chat is pepega
[1:38:29] Snakix: Oh yeah everyone who hit the gong, but you need to finish the quest for it, which requiert a lot of farm
[1:38:30] bobbytheorc: everyone
[1:38:30] itsmedemolink: in 10 hours yes. but not everyone in a guild
[1:38:32] felsteam: xar u r right
[1:38:33] LilTaisu: THE MOUNT GOES TO EVERYONE WHO RINGS THE GONG @XARYU THE ISSUE IS THE LIMITED ITEMS PER GUILD

[1:38:53] Dracconfoo: KKona
[1:38:55] fakeGrimes: everyone who turns in gets title and mound... hes talking about ONE PERSON PER GUILD is whats usually done
[1:38:58] kirk_hunts: everyone has to do the full chest line in order to get mount and title
[1:38:58] eggsbenedicked: No multiple people in guild can get it but most guilds chose to let many guildies do the title quest
[1:39:01] Len1366: so much misinformation in chat

[1:47:04] AnyroadTwo: It’s always terrible
[1:47:05] kfc_manager11: soooo fucking wrong.... Bliz need to ban GDKP
[1:47:12] Gimnasi0: GDKPs aren't the problem, its blizzard that doesn't do shit
[1:47:14] kaizen421: nah GDKP is good
[1:47:15] Thebonelessr: yea it so away from its source
[1:47:16] dashjuicy: it influences people to buy gold
[1:47:16] Beakz______: gdkps are amazing, bots are the core of the problem
[1:47:21] huckleson: if gold buying miraculously wasnt a thing gdkp would be awesome. but tht will never be the case sadly
[1:47:24] Nicholas909: nah i wouldve quit SOD by now if GDKP wasnt allowed
[1:47:25] kaizen421: yes bots are the only problem
[1:47:27] kfc_manager11: Just fucking ban the word GDKP, soooo easy
[1:47:28] tuna_sandw1ch: its like a massage, great but you pay a bit and can get a happy ending
[1:47:33] XunioWonsu: the gold buyers give you their gold in the gdkp, it's self-correcting
[1:47:35] ScarletPaladin: i feel like gold buying wasn't so atrocious back then
[1:47:46] playerpersonx: @Beakz______ actually blizz not banning gold buyers is the core of the problem. banning gold buyers = no bots
[1:47:51] bumlaska: catJAM
[1:47:58] bigwilly3737: @Nicholas909 by your a gold buyer only reason you wouldnt be playing wow if it wasnt a thing
[1:48:02] kfc_manager11: GDKP is literally the probleme and EVERYONE know it, u too @Xaryu
[1:48:06] bigwilly3737: bc*

[1:48:12] melvinguyy: if u want gear, just make your own raid and HR your bis xdd
[1:48:16] Beakz______: @playerpersonx if there wasnt bots gold buying wouldnt even be a problem
[1:48:31] Xzanelol: @kfc_manager11 sorry they don't invite you
[1:48:55] stevebyweb: EZ
[1:48:58] kfc_manager11: @Xzanelol im not homophobic, dont get me wrong, i just refuse to do GDKP
[1:49:12] playerpersonx: @Beakz______ yes but obviously blizz arent competent enough to sniff out and ban the bots, or at least ban them for long enough to get rid of them. people operating bots just make new accounts
[1:49:17] kfc_manager11: Its literally aids but in WoW

[2:11:40] DendeDewd: @LuxzGaming no its like ark survival evolved with [pokemon
[2:11:42] eggsbenedicked: If Sonii is spondered by them it must be pretty good, he's not gonna buy shit supplements 4
[2:11:47] Kanooog: @DendeDewd Still a step up from Game Boy
[2:11:47] bladeezz1816: 27 and I still play Pokémon often
[2:11:48] fallentofame: Did Pokémon tm actually have anything to do with Palworld??? or is it just because it’s so similar
[2:11:54] apexariestv: so is ssf hardcore going to have it own server?
[2:11:56] californiacal: did you ever see the new palumor vid about the fastest 1 shots
[2:12:00] seksmuhchine: not a drug

[2:12:35] Bolt_: Is Ghost Wolf 40% speed?
[2:12:36] larnsmarf: made a new tauren shaman last night.

[2:13:25] croolez: ok thank.

[2:14:40] larnsmarf: if you have the TB buff and using shaman wolf are you just zoomin?
[2:14:42] eggsbenedicked: Imagine hitting 25, heading to Hardcore BFD and getting a bis piece from each boss Poggers
[2:14:46] hutchyy917: looks like sodcore p2 might be impossible
[2:14:52] Nicholas909: tbh only reason i havent played sodcore is cuz its horde
[2:14:54] gutshotx: @xaryu  like your dog, I mean Kai, pulls out your Ethernet cable?
[2:14:57] yulenissen: I had no idea it was a horde thing tbh

[2:15:08] big_nizzo: !SODCORE
[2:15:09] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[2:15:18] mudfellow: @Xaryu all time fav: horde or alli?
[2:15:23] hutchyy917: i think pvp event in stv might axe any possibility of questing in stv
[2:15:35] aRizeee: I started playing Palworld this weekend and man it’s a good time with friends. Strongly recommend getting a server.
[2:15:38] plae007: @hutchyy917 RP server
[2:15:44] Deathbloomzx: is the raid full on heals tomorrow?

[2:15:59] adam_brisbane: no serve you can solo
[2:16:00] Dethkar_tv: will neff asnd tectone have streamer servers
[2:16:00] Kenithal: you don't need a server if you want to play solo
[2:16:03] breezegodd: @Xaryu are you getting longer strecthes of sleep yet?
[2:16:05] TheRealPabloSanchez: I still always picture you as an undead mage.
[2:16:07] MrVucis: do single player

[2:16:17] hutchyy917: i thought I saw that everyone gets flagged? ash on non pvp doesn’t flag?
[2:16:19] bigwilly3737: hes a streamer he prob wants to play with other streamers
[2:16:27] markstop: you can play up to 4 without a server
[2:16:27] merlinsleftnut: Hey @Xaryu what can you tell me about AG1?
[2:16:28] Gemini_Iceland: but there would be other people on the server Kappa
[2:16:29] MrVucis: there is no pvp yet
[2:16:34] merlinsleftnut: HMMMMM????
[2:16:42] Cross86: Server if you want to play with viewers. And only 4 to a party
[2:16:44] TheRealPabloSanchez: with a big ol sword on your back
[2:16:47] shalomski: Problem with palworld server is you have to give ip address out if yours
[2:16:47] cyrusctff7: Wouldn’t it make sense to grind mobs all the way to 25 to get more greens? From a non-streamer POV of course.
[2:16:52] acey1994: Will you play more pvp in SOD P2 on your mage?
[2:16:54] kirk_hunts: if you're not rolling 20 deep max level in STV you're dead and even with 20 you're still probably dead
[2:16:58] mudfellow: why alli ? :)
[2:17:03] typer___iban: are you guys talking about Palworld, or sod servers for STV? FeelsDankMan

[2:17:12] ohheyitsLarry: can you still use void touched gear after dropping the relevant profession?
[2:17:16] ninpoon: IS SOLO SELF FOUND OUT YET?
[2:17:17] aRizeee: Playing Coop requires someone to have the game on if anyone else wants to play. Server is the way to go
[2:17:19] buhtterstick: you ever been to STV bro?
[2:17:20] xNotorietyx: STV is a bloodbath without pvp event
[2:17:23] FreckFPS: questing there will probably be hectic lol
[2:17:24] kirk_hunts: World pvp in STV is insane regardless of event
[2:17:28] Muckbot1: @KirkDouglasHC JudgeLayer?
[2:17:29] iamabirdttv: NO YOU CANT
[2:17:33] Munkeeboy007: yes you can

[2:17:41] Muckbot1: @KirkDouglasHC o7
[2:17:42] purplewingedboa: The item goes red
[2:17:43] Mahca_: official event won’t be 24/7 but stv PvP is always 24/7
[2:17:44] Munkeeboy007: i have friend who has leather gloves for dps and mail armor for tank
[2:17:45] Erbsosa: stv gonna be easy stop the cap
[2:17:53] bigwilly3737: lol sodcore is pve
[2:17:58] Shieldexx: OH, he's live! Finally I catch u live lol
[2:17:59] kirk_hunts: I'm talking crusader strike
[2:18:00] iamabirdttv: it will not allow you to use it, it literally says " requires 100 leatherworking " exc
[2:18:01] Hyperioz: @Munkeeboy007 maybe he has both bs and lw?
[2:18:02] kirk_hunts: pvp
[2:18:07] FreckFPS: living flame will be on fire

[2:18:15] eggsbenedicked: Staysafe pog
[2:18:25] cunnamy: I just die on my max lvl acc
[2:18:25] yttam_matty: will this whole hardcore thing be over after the next BFD?
[2:18:33] kirk_hunts: or Lava Lash you guys will be fine
[2:18:45] OGTigolebitties: I’m all about living flame pvp rn , since it’s alliance heavy there’s always plenty to kill :)
[2:18:58] FreckFPS: @OGTigolebitties its pretty damn fun in wetlands and redridge
[2:19:05] OGTigolebitties: a bunch of under geared ally running around and u can just 1v3
[2:19:05] thapper_from_wish: Sadge
[2:19:07] OGTigolebitties: oh yeah
[2:19:15] mudfellow: whats ur plans until phase 2?
[2:19:21] Chefy0shi: but def. Phrase 2'
[2:19:24] Akompliss: I'll be shocked if it lives through phase 2
[2:19:25] kirk_hunts: Judgelayer will be up and running in Judgement on p2 launch
[2:19:36] Muckbot1: LETS GO Krik
[2:19:37] snizzletofff: Think its cool your doing a run with the community this time. But would also be neat to see additional runs and trying to actually gear out the group.
[2:19:47] skerrzo: when p2 drops your doing HC to start or a normal toon on like crusader strike?
[2:19:50] Zerksyera: come play some classic era pvp :)
[2:19:52] Gemini_Iceland: I hope developers realize that having a death penalty in games can be a good thing
[2:19:56] emir_h113: variety POGGERS
[2:20:01] Doimos89: I'm curious what you'll say about palworld
[2:20:03] Coorslite619: Palworld is on the xbox game pass by the way
[2:20:07] shortshorts010: Did I miss barney reacts?
[2:20:08] zerozuckerl: 2 week no wow?
[2:20:17] Alexxhaal: what happened to Onlyfangs? and Xarbarian?? @Xaryu
[2:20:17] mudfellow: whats palworld?
[2:20:18] OGTigolebitties: i know they are doing stranglethorn vale as the next pvp event but I wonder how that will go, isn’t that area huge kinda compared to Ashenvale?
[2:20:23] dobbygang19: What are your thoughts on throne and liberty ? I saw people playing Korean servers and it looks far more entertaining than the beta
[2:20:27] ChristmasAndrew: Palworld is gonna be hype
[2:20:28] kirk_hunts: @Muckbot1 Layer invite. got his epic 2h sword last week lol
[2:20:55] apriljunechat: whatever happened to soda? he hasn't been streaming
[2:21:02] Akompliss: That's so sad.. All that bought gold just poofed
[2:21:03] Muckbot1: Hugeeeeee. My 3 toons are jucied now with epics too. Waiting for P2 xarCOPIUM
[2:21:03] GotLuck: have you heard of Project Ascension WoW (private server)?
[2:21:16] Opticanbam: typical otk take tbh - always
[2:21:17] kirk_hunts: I still have never seen an xbow on Kirkk
[2:21:19] valentinooo: ssf with that guild LUL
[2:21:20] tha_wicked: i dont see it ever coming back, im shocked it made it as far as it did
[2:21:23] buhtterstick: those streamers aren't doing SSF
[2:21:25] Landotazo: bummer about onlyfangs, would have been fun but the timing of SoD killed it
[2:21:28] ninpoon: WAIT WAIT WHATS WRONG WITH SOLO SELF FOUND??
[2:21:29] raidenszz: yo random question but do you remember arenaing vs Kyra, holy pally back in wotlk?
[2:21:33] Oeek: Onlyfangs was kinda fail with all the powerlevlning
[2:21:35] Himaru7: @Xaryu any plans on dark and darker?
[2:21:43] the_teleporter: you probably get this a lot, but has your wife ever considered playing WoW with you? @Xaryu
[2:22:17] LithoSlam: @the_teleporter follow up: when's your kid starting?
[2:22:29] the_teleporter: true hahaha
[2:22:31] LilTaisu: they wouldnt have had have the streamers there without mob tagging
[2:22:35] LilTaisu: but i agree it made it lame
[2:22:38] stankylank: wasnt the whole point to get content though? who wanna watch someone level for three weeks lol
[2:22:39] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[2:22:47] lordsloths: shannon is not a fan lol
[2:22:49] pepe_islove: WONDER WHY KEKW
[2:22:50] kyomaiku: so...horde or alliance?
[2:22:50] FridayKnightMagic: but that’s also what saved rav so whatever mob tagging is worth
[2:22:59] ReisilEQ: @Xaryu Been away from WoW since BFA, thinking about getting back into it. Would you recommend: Retail, Classic, or SoD?
[2:23:06] hanbrolo5: hanbrolo5 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! lost my 46 druid last night. such a crushing feeling. we go agane
[2:23:06] maurimau93: what enchance you use for wappon at this lvl @xaryu
[2:23:11] BusterNaught: I miss ring of titans
[2:23:12] LuxzGaming: @ReisilEQ SoD
[2:23:14] Cross86: Has she even tried gaming?
[2:23:15] KShellZx: i personally love that my wife doesn't play WoW with me. we love mario co op games though
[2:23:15] ninpoon: @Xaryu is solo self found only for SOD??
[2:23:19] TheRealPabloSanchez: Season of Dads is lit
[2:23:32] OGTigolebitties: it’s crazy girls actually like wow compared to a lot of other video games, like way more common than you’d think lol
[2:23:33] terminator4kkrom: sod is pumping atm
[2:23:36] Scnozzberry: sod for sure
[2:23:39] bigwilly3737: makes me sad getting on dp and seeing no one
[2:23:53] ReisilEQ: Would you recommend a server for SoD. Probably not Hardcore because I haven't played in years haha
[2:23:54] BusterNaught: Ring of titans classic trillePog
[2:23:56] LeithersKedge: when's the baby due?
[2:24:03] H1LT0: Season of Dads is my guild name on Lone Wolf
[2:24:12] j_dillinger777: its just the beginning xar$$$
[2:24:16] LithoSlam: if you stopped in BFA, you probably didn't have fun in retail, so i would try one of the other versions
[2:24:18] lordsloths: just spent 2 hours setting my ui up and it reset on me
[2:24:21] Tropicocity: @ReisilEQ if you dont want PVP, roll on wild growth
[2:24:23] espi: Crusader Strike has too much people not
[2:24:23] Chasyforsure: they xar what u think about they adding arenas to 60s content?
[2:24:26] malificari: i feel like they should really make the game "seasonal" by letting you just make level 25 alts when the new season starts
[2:24:27] seksmuhchine: too many
[2:24:40] bigwilly3737: this is why putting progress into wow is kinda not worth nowadays because the servers just change so fast you cant even progress
[2:24:42] promotius: what is BFD
[2:24:43] grizz430: CS is awful
[2:24:45] OGTigolebitties: living flame if ur horde
[2:24:52] typer___iban: HUH
[2:24:53] ggSKEET: hell no
[2:24:55] xiClutchBoyix: lmao wtf
[2:24:56] xiClutchBoyix: hell naw
[2:24:57] mrtomtishh: If that was so, nobody would play this now
[2:24:57] FactoryOfHorrors: this is still classic
[2:24:59] LuxzGaming: nooo
[2:25:01] bluevexlo: you ll get exp buff
[2:25:06] bluevexlo: for 1-25
[2:25:11] xwowkillax: fun DansGame
[2:25:11] kirk_hunts: I just finished level my 6th alt they better not hand out level 25s for free
[2:25:13] Scnozzberry: 1-25 is the fun part
[2:25:16] terminator4kkrom: exp buff incoming
[2:25:24] malificari: no one is gonna do those things anymore imo. you think people will still do BFD?
[2:25:25] promotius: which hardcore do we have tomorow a fresh new server ?
[2:25:30] Mahca_: some people need 1-25 to learn their class too
[2:25:33] shalomski: Once p2 starts there is bonus exp 1-25
[2:25:34] the_teleporter: hot take: you cant level past 25 until you're 7/7 BFD
[2:25:36] typer___iban: people trying to speed up 1-25, when we've had all this time to level all the alts we want, smh
[2:25:43] joonelius3: I bet ashenvale pvp will be a lot funnier when majority move away from there!
[2:25:44] finalflight1: retail mindset
[2:25:45] eggsbenedicked: or maybe give like 50% exp increase between 1 and 20 to give a little boost for new players, but that would mean alt levelling would be miles easier
[2:25:48] Kenithal: I feel like the runes make leveling way more fun and on non HC its super fast
[2:25:49] Tropicocity: Only got warlock left to have 8/8 25s hordeside, paladin still 6
[2:25:52] seksmuhchine: latency and prio is what you should look at
[2:25:55] eggsbenedicked: would encourage a population boost imo though
[2:25:57] draega1989: how was your weekend?
[2:25:59] ggSKEET: 1-25 are the foundation levels of a toon setting up profressions and stuff
[2:25:59] Chasyforsure: @Xaryu arenas to 60s content in sod yes or no?
[2:26:00] Videx240: stab stab stab stab
[2:26:01] PeachesFromTulsa: @malificari absolutely. its bis gear til new raid
[2:26:15] TheRealPabloSanchez: I'm such a casual gamer. I just finally hit 25 and got pre raid bis. Only goal is to clear BFD before the 8th now.
[2:26:17] Mahca_: @eggsbenedicked they are giving xp boost 1-25 next phase
[2:26:20] drummond777: HUH
[2:26:24] Landotazo: i thought SoM bonus xp to quests was a good way for alts to level, it puts ppl out in world insrtead of boosting, though they also killed boosting in SoM with other changes
[2:26:28] eggsbenedicked: ah my thoughts exactly xD
[2:26:32] kirk_hunts: I can't decide what my main will be. Mage PVP is so much fun especially with the double mage wsg meta
[2:26:56] eggsbenedicked: Payo node stealing vibes right there
[2:27:01] KShellZx: 1-25 is where you learn to play your character. that's a problem with retail where you can buy a max lvl, jump into a dungeon, and have no idea waht you're doing
[2:27:02] JWCM: You know what would have been a fun idea, brawlers guild esque but for dueling, win 5 in a row win rep or a weapon etc
[2:27:02] aziidus: aziidus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:27:15] sn00ze_butt0n: what about like dueling arenas?
[2:27:17] Alaithan: Preach, agree with you 100%
[2:27:22] huckleson: just leave it unranked and casual
[2:27:26] huckleson: why does it need to be competitive
[2:27:29] Bigchiefa: Solo shuffle sod

[3:22:07] asloff: @notyofriendguy it basically gives you mph ticks in combat allowing you to spam shocks
[3:22:09] PMA_1: ditchjones
[3:22:10] malificari: what if you die in SFK KEKL
[3:22:11] Alassianss: @Knaxxis Nah i dont stream or anything sadly but maybe next season been talking to few high m+ guys want me to stream aswell :)
[3:22:13] asloff: mp5*
[3:22:25] sunny_lik: inv for SFK , rogue healer here
[3:22:41] running_backing: takes away the downtime
[3:22:42] notyofriendguy: Isn't shield mastery giving tons though?
[3:22:47] LithoSlam: you go agan
[3:22:52] espi: that one room
[3:23:06] murkien: just watch out for the one room where they can all aggro
[3:23:11] drizzardofoz: dust to dust
[3:23:12] buhtterstick: inb4 ganked
[3:23:16] graziNNN: FAP EZ
[3:23:21] omglookbrandon: we all say that then an hour after just start another character
[3:23:24] yewww: is there a rule that if u get stream snipped it doesnt count?
[3:23:32] cerediirn: southshore guard comes out of nowhere and 1 shots you
[3:23:43] malificari: spirit wolf room aggro lmfao
[3:23:46] DeathToad007: inb4 ur a dumbass.. too late
[3:23:54] buhtterstick: rp realms sound nice
[3:24:10] lukemeleney: oh, is this the revenge stream?
[3:24:13] yewww: oh its just rp not rp-pvp gotcha
[3:24:15] notyofriendguy: Until you get mc'd in the arugula fight then walk out of the instance
[3:24:20] baddecisiondanx: you can't do ubrs at this level
[3:24:23] snugglefistsgaming: do you think petri potions alter the integrity or spirit of hardcore?
[3:24:30] notyofriendguy: Lol arugal **
[3:24:54] notyofriendguy: If you get mc'd, you're pvp flagged
[3:24:57] adam_brisbane: Lava burst rune is in Hillsbrad but might be to dangerous for you to do the dya before raid
[3:25:07] malificari: u can get friendly fired by arugal yea lmfao
[3:25:07] notyofriendguy: Then you walk out and get ganged. Lol
[3:25:30] 4ddic7: @notyofriendguy oh man that arugula
[3:25:50] malificari: bubble hearth baby
[3:25:52] malificari: fuck yall
[3:25:53] TheRealPabloSanchez: OOO this guy sometimes has fat looot
[3:26:01] theafkush: imagine Petri used being limited to once per character, would be ideal imo
[3:26:03] PMA_1: i had to kill like 15 mobs for LB
[3:26:13] espi: VERY hard to farm on shaman
[3:26:16] zonewwolfen: Check weapon vendor as well can have big 1h axe
[3:26:16] mdgez: hmm but at the same time petris are a guarantee for those taking the raids seriously and getting griefed by trolls
[3:26:21] nfs65: u can use profession items ? @Xaryu
[3:26:26] Farenheight451: @Xaryu Pick wild steelbloom
[3:26:31] Farenheight451: it drops it
[3:26:33] sixetqt: he cant get lava burst because you have to go in RFC again and its against the rules
[3:26:36] ronke420: u need big bear meat for cooking
[3:26:37] snugglefistsgaming: i get my ele earths from herbing
[3:26:43] BombDiggy: charred vale but its sketch
[3:26:45] typer___iban: SSF with unlimited professions would be incredible
[3:26:46] Milllzee: The earth elementals in 1k
[3:26:47] Whetherey: release date for p2 yet?
[3:26:54] Hellacat: liferoot too
[3:27:02] sumdumphuk: Feb 8
[3:27:16] omglookbrandon: that sounds like the move
[3:27:23] PMA_1: minmaxing
[3:27:37] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: meaning what?
[3:27:43] grubols: it sounds sick
[3:27:44] stroobzbeats: 4 would be awesome
[3:27:52] mrmightysmith: make eng like a secondary one
[3:27:53] BLUNDERGUN: @chickenarmsandlegs you can go get every resource on one character
[3:27:57] Woah_Zerk: Since you can use plans, could you get the epic gloves?
[3:28:03] gabaceptor: that would be great and would encourage grinding like runescape
[3:28:04] greatestever893: Bag space would be a nighmare
[3:28:05] graziNNN: they need to add another bag slot or two then xD
[3:28:05] Woah_Zerk: if so keep LW for after the raid if you liv
[3:28:06] lukemeleney: I think you should be able to have all the gathering professions, but then pick one or two crafting professions
[3:28:10] Kenithal: gathering professions shouldn't be main professions
[3:28:11] FlashKingCookie: But then ssf would be too easy. Then also make every mob elite
[3:28:16] buhtterstick: lol just got an ele earth from a steelbloom
[3:28:21] wowdespise: youll need 30 slot bags for that
[3:28:25] draega1989: theres a river nearby i saw a streamer get ganked by a guard
[3:28:26] lukemeleney: @Kenithal I feel you there
[3:28:27] draega1989: it was wild
[3:28:30] LithoSlam: it would be bad to die to those guards again
[3:28:30] NekoTheSpook010: Southshore... Been there, done that
[3:28:33] 4ddic7: I wand woodworking to be a profession that gets integrated, also more bow making and arrow making
[3:28:36] DancingMum: but isnt good, in an mmo, to not be selfsustaining. So you need other people and stuff?
[3:28:37] awsmwsmd: Why the Southshore hate??? LOL
[3:28:39] baddecisiondanx: @Woah_Zerk you need the pot and d/e mats too. would definitely be a lot of work
[3:28:42] FeelsBadWoman: unlimited would be bad i think, everyone will collect herbs mine stuff if that happens
[3:28:44] yourbillisdeau: i think maybe a main gathering, and then off gathering profession has less success rate or gives less
[3:28:52] moopsacl: what add on you use for your quest log
[3:28:52] nagalaz: you would have to boost herb/mining node spawn rates then
[3:28:54] Highmen3: the crafted shoulders look better thats for sure
[3:28:55] awsmwsmd: I know it was ajoke
[3:28:57] MEDICx87: just follow the river... it'll be fine Kappa
[3:28:57] BLUNDERGUN: @DancingMum its literally "self found mode" no goruping
[3:28:58] iceberg_simpson1998: @DancingMum exactly
[3:29:01] typer___iban: just because you can do all profs doesn't mean you will/can afford to, but the option is nice and the challenge is what you make it
[3:29:07] gabaceptor: @DancingMum i mean its sorta played out the interactions
[3:29:14] VandxterFTW: LUL
[3:29:14] DancingMum: @BLUNDERGUN at max level it isnt right?
[3:29:16] Farenheight451: @Xaryu There are alot of steelbloom in area in north stone talon by the alliance FP
[3:29:16] Woah_Zerk: @Woah_Zerk yeah I suppose he would need elixir and DE mats which are one hell of a farm in SoDcore. The gloves would be nastyyyy though
[3:29:23] purrfecto: should just make gathering professions unlimitied
[3:29:24] shabomination: all gathering, just like 2ndaries, and then 2 crafting profs
[3:29:28] purrfecto: and only 2 crafted professions
[3:29:30] buhtterstick: can you learn BS/LW to craft the epic item then switch profs?
[3:29:31] kirk_hunts: They should make it unlimited professions but all professions are leveled by fishing
[3:29:32] malificari: i think that would kill alts
[3:29:45] BLUNDERGUN: @DancingMum i think they are doing some different stuff for max level
[3:29:50] Ryzir: just add 1 gathering only profession slot (Skinning, Herb, or Mine)
[3:29:56] typer___iban: osrs has "solo" mode too and it can exist just fine, its called Ironman
[3:30:06] Misterion777: rpg with really shitty gameplay :D
[3:30:25] notyofriendguy: Sounds awesome when you're ssf, but it's definitely not a good idea for the regular game mode or even regular hc
[3:30:31] pasto25: Could you turn off the music? It is doing bullshit sounds
[3:30:34] gabaceptor: gameplay thats lasted 20 years
[3:30:42] Reaperz_kinetic: @misterion777 bad take
[3:30:43] Misterion777: for mmo its fine, but compare it to TES for example
[3:30:43] ech0cide: wow is so much better than any other mmo out there
[3:30:44] Kenithal: the thing is FF you can do all professions and its still good as an mmo
[3:30:51] Skriptmonkey: How is the targeting system outdated? Would you prefer something like New World?
[3:30:57] izhappy1: why watch a wow streamer if gameplay bad :::
[3:30:59] Reaperz_kinetic: @pasto25 hell nah
[3:31:03] PMA_1: music is pretty low
[3:31:07] SmugJerry: Listening WoW music Listening
[3:31:07] asloff: what class in classic has "skill shots"?
[3:31:10] Reaperz_kinetic: @izhappy1 because people like to complain
[3:31:11] handovdoom666: wow music is so nice and calm
[3:31:17] tha_wicked: @Misterion777 TES combat is shallow
[3:31:18] jaliela01: @xaryu i got the SPP recipe from the tradesman in Tarren Mill yesterday. EZ
[3:31:19] cheetobbob: like GW2?
[3:31:20] heavenscloudlol: Either let us level multiple profs, OR make the necessary items (enchanting rods, engy stuff needed for BS, etc) available through quests around the world. Like gather something for a goblin in booty bay and he sells you stuff
[3:31:21] KShellZx: like new world
[3:31:30] Misterion777: i mean you never just grind 10 wolfs in solo rpgs
[3:31:31] oJNelly: how could u aim a lightning bolt
[3:31:33] Darthvendor: agree
[3:31:33] Donho2: i like tab targeting but i'm old
[3:31:36] iceberg_simpson1998: i'd love an mmo with like 100 professions for every item in the game basically
[3:31:37] PMA_1: put on some gnomer music
[3:31:37] asloff: I love the wow targeting system too
[3:31:38] dobbygang19: Aka new world has great fighting along with games like tera
[3:31:43] 4ddic7: u know
[3:31:44] Meer_: Why would we copy the target system that has been the best for 20 years ??????
[3:31:48] Krekdent: i like wow targeting
[3:31:49] oJNelly: you minimize abilities by not using targetting
[3:31:51] BLUNDERGUN: SWTOR did it and i loved taht game
[3:31:53] Shovel99: i like tab target with a few skills shots
[3:31:55] gabaceptor: tab targeting is good until theres 100 pets in one 3v3 match
[3:31:56] ech0cide: @heavenscloudlol why do people always want to take the mmo elements out of wow
[3:32:09] drjabbar: Bc wow is good
[3:32:14] Chach4life: the fact that u need a target to actually cast most of ur skills kinda kills it for me tho, action combat add lots more freedom in skill usage
[3:32:15] Meer_: nothing is better , its just the best version
[3:32:17] asloff: @gabaceptor bind tab to "target nearest enemy player"
[3:32:19] Erbsosa: how doyou know if the people joining the raid didnt follow your same rules for SOD SSF
[3:32:20] Dowsha_tv: @Xaryu  I loved the skill shot / TArget  systems, but ofc not good for custom players
[3:32:20] Jukeing: I like the targeting but I really do miss skill shots
[3:32:32] Jukeing: Adds another layer to skill gap
[3:32:33] KShellZx: they tried to implement that a little with Evokers in Retail
[3:32:37] silex1690: LOTRO uses same system as WoW
[3:32:42] KShellZx: where you actually have to aim your attack
[3:32:44] Meer_: @Chach4life it doesnt translate to mmos, the gameplay is almost always a burn out after a  while
[3:32:48] docbhudda: wtf i just got an ele earth from asteelbloom too KEKW
[3:32:49] Farenheight451: I think for a long time devs tried to make new mmos that had the potential to also be esports. I hope they go away from that.
[3:33:01] TheKraken2024: GW2 is about the same.  Maybe even a bit better than WoW.
[3:33:02] snoop_bro: What about classic mechanics with retails visual upgrades?
[3:33:05] ggSKEET: grenades
[3:33:06] LithoSlam: HUH
[3:33:06] typer___iban: hey cock
[3:33:06] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: archeage had really great tab targeting
[3:33:13] Dmayne513: my coc always lands
[3:33:15] blaaaaakee: i wish they hadn't messed up swtor like they did
[3:33:16] boneappletea6: bombs
[3:33:16] zerozuckerl: better aim well with your xarCoC
[3:33:17] flaxxalf: yep cock
[3:33:19] NekoTheSpook010: Molten blast
[3:33:22] Jjinks: We love thick xarcocs
[3:33:23] Meer_: Proper arena CC is harder to grasp for people than skill shots
[3:33:24] pinkmegan: xarCoC
[3:33:26] docbhudda: whyre these flowers dropping rocks lmao
[3:33:26] breezegodd: Xar desperately needs a new weapon
[3:33:31] asloff: hunter traps are the real skillshots in wow (retail)
[3:33:33] PocketLotion: I was see a huge coc
[3:33:34] LithoSlam: my coc never has the range i think it should
[3:33:46] Farenheight451: steelbloom also make defense pots @Xaryu
[3:33:49] graziNNN: Hillman's are pretty good
[3:33:57] Dowsha_tv: @Xaryu  With Skillshots Mage'S could cast instant  right?
[3:34:02] zerozuckerl: is there an upgrade in SFK that could drop today?
[3:34:04] docbhudda: you doing the whole 1 dungeon only thing?
[3:34:13] SurrealAndre: sfk today?
[3:34:15] dramajohns: @Xaryu does icy veins reduce global cooldown and wand speed ?
[3:34:28] NekoTheSpook010: Butcher's cleaver good too
[3:34:33] Reaperz_kinetic: @zerozuckerl yeh a few
[3:34:50] docbhudda: meteor shard like an 18% drop Sadge
[3:35:15] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: did you go DM?
[3:35:17] samonecural94: BTC BLEEDAGE @Xaryu
[3:35:19] BuggyBank: are your viewers ready for tomorrow ?
[3:35:26] pand0ca: bro they should create a ssf for sod
[3:35:28] Hakuryuu2: did we watch barney today?
[3:35:34] asloff: isnt there some big elite yeti out here or is that only after cata?

[3:51:39] malificari: @rjhasnoclue classic boss4es do nothing lol
[3:51:40] kmilmuza: WA > Questie because it would be a matter of time someone creates questie from WA
