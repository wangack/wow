[2:45:40] GamingDad77: @jaws120 I agree. I would actually use some of my 4 week vacation time for it
[2:46:01] akia03: could be a mob drop
[2:46:32] alantin77: dungeon drop?
[2:46:33] Kinghorn: they invite more people to the betas, alphas are more exclusive

[2:48:24] Kinghorn: DH is gonna be last
[2:48:34] Kinghorn: they have no idea what to do with them
[2:49:02] sliproach: DH removed not enough skill to make new talent tree
[2:49:39] Sollice: its true

[2:49:40] Holysal: @sliproach not true look at enovker
[2:49:43] Nokram: they first have to create a lot of new stuff for havoc, otherwise it wouldnt be a talent tree. it would be a talent stick
[2:49:46] blerd: @sliproach nonsense, just take some more warlock abilities it'll be fine
[2:49:55] Ealdfox: DH have sacrificed everything, they have nothing left Kappa
[2:49:57] captiv8: Monks and demon hunters have never had the og talent trees. So I’m not surprised they are last.
[2:50:01] BearOfLight: this just in DH cancelled!
[2:50:04] Sleyenda_UK: advanced class tho
[2:50:18] raldrik: Blizzard scratching head, how we make skill tree with only 5 skills.
[2:50:18] BearOfLight: monk isnt a hero class

[2:50:38] ashwing_: 2% haste nodes everywhere LUL
[2:50:40] akia03: like surv they only have skills from legion and up not enough really for the new trees
[2:50:47] Thoreya: gz
[2:50:48] skrin001: maybe they are trying to get them working good with out having the buffs they give for others in raids.
[2:50:50] Vitalsigns64: inb4 DH gets a complete rework
[2:50:52] soflotcg: after the DK the  other "premium" classes have been disappointing
[2:51:25] Sollice: They need to stop making its core abilities completely useless. I mean no one uses Blade Dance which is a core ability. And I cant type in d a n c e without some stupid emote coming up
[2:51:50] Biorrwolf: The Diablo Hammer!
[2:52:14] TheBroCrow: all the raid icons for some reason
[2:52:18] AmZambie: is it a quick mark system?

[2:56:23] dwanex_: Longer, full of trash and open not linear
[2:56:29] Korupcija_: UBRS long
[2:56:29] Cidal_: motherlode vibes
[2:57:05] Banjo586: is this pandaria? KEKW
[2:57:18] captiv8: I read that they tuned the turning in dragonriding, does it feel better to you?
[2:57:30] duffluv22: Are warlock talents up sir?
[2:57:54] Karbonn: Is it me or does it feel like Blizzard is actually putting a lot more into this xpac than previous ones so far? Maybe im dreaming...
[2:57:54] JStevenson: @towelliee did the changes to the prot tree make it any better?  Just the placement of the talents
[2:58:16] TheCliffyShow: MrGM did Azure Vaults a few minutes ago. He did not like it. He's doing Brackenhide Hollow now. Looks cool.

[2:59:32] Deadelus0: THat's a bug
[2:59:38] Deadelus0: MrGM already reported it
[2:59:42] akia03: you mean soul shards as items in bag?
[3:00:04] Revoca: @Towelliee  its because the paladin dev doesn
[3:00:13] Revoca: doesn't play the class
[3:00:16] Mr_Pennywise_: you did not get the food buff
[3:00:23] Revoca: by his own admission
[3:00:23] Mr_Pennywise_: OH lol
[3:00:24] Daarksyde: did holy paly go melee or range?
[3:00:29] Biorrwolf: @akia03 yeah. My biggest issue with Retail in general is that everything has moved to a build/spend style of play
[3:00:29] Kneckt: i thought party art was updated or am i dumb
[3:00:32] Eggz1004: have you tried out the new warlock tree yet? @Towelliee
[3:00:34] Zevn1166: They gave all of the special things prot pally had to other specs/classes. Then limited our holy power generation so we cant off heal. The spec just doesnt do anything special now.
[3:00:36] Mr_Pennywise_: disregard me
[3:00:42] thebakeriscomingforu: Guess I'll pass on my prot pally if that holds out going into DF.
[3:01:02] Kneckt: @Towelliee didnt party frame art get updated?

[4:46:07] MarquisLek: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

[5:24:46] pringlez91: WoW Dragonflight Alpha --> Closed Beta --> Open Beta, enough to keep up occupied until the game releases
[5:24:50] CardinalTX: Nice to see a zone that isn’t 80% grey

[5:25:31] Kuzzo99: why was mop open beta a shit show?
[5:25:34] WesSideVandal: yeah open beta for MoP was solely because of the annual pass, another mistake they have yet to repeat
[5:25:42] r0b928: I remember that beta. It was nuts. I remember that hot air balloon quest.
[5:26:04] vluggejaapie89: is flying speed still nerfed?

[5:28:08] Zettabyte: @Aidler If I can't get @Towelliee's then I wait til I can get it. Thansk though towLove :)
[5:28:10] ZyntosAran: no, gamerbulk does also not have your bundle or any starter bundle. Its just a 3rd party side
[5:28:15] Aidler: because they are only a reseller
[5:28:23] Dwaynewise: What are your thoughts on Dragonflight so far Towlee??
[5:28:32] tronbadgames: inertia nerf
[5:28:41] Aidler: www.gamerbulk.com
[5:28:47] sLogOG: i'm sorry but this looks so stupid, shouldn't be releasing like this imo
[5:28:51] tronbadgames: thats what it looks like
[5:29:07] dankmeliodas: It’s probably a bug from the dracthyr nerf
[5:29:07] Hephtin: Did blizzard nerf something cause it was to fun?
[5:29:35] ADVANCEDgg: @Towelliee Hey dear hope you're well <3 <3 <3

[5:30:03] sLogOG: so which dungeon is the most fun you had so far?
[5:30:07] dankmeliodas: It’s the same system so probably shares some of the same code
[5:30:22] HonestPhilosophy: Too much fun lol
[5:30:27] b_l_i_z_z_y: Theyre dumb
[5:30:34] TompsonX: I think they're just testing it?
[5:30:40] Kosen_: The delay definitely fucked thing sup
[5:30:43] thebestwarlockk: wasnt the forward propel thing a bug ?
[5:30:44] PlagueHit: So, how many phases left?
[5:30:45] DaProfit: is it a dragon talent?
[5:30:47] thebestwarlockk: why would you propel
[5:30:50] b_l_i_z_z_y: hey we made something that everyone thinks is awesome. ;ets nerf it!
[5:30:52] thebestwarlockk: it seemed like its number 1
[5:30:59] TwoShotTV: I try to remember that we don't normally have flying at the start of  Xpacs so they can't make it to good from the start.
[5:31:01] cmdrwedge: wen dragonflight beta?
[5:31:02] Roshiro: is it an earlier zone? perhaps the late dragons had more talents
[5:31:05] tavon1998: blizz change stuff when they see fun
[5:31:10] warrenny: This the last zine?
[5:31:21] aribellae: Is there no Shadowlands Keystone Hero: Season Four achievement?
[5:31:47] Luxicake: Oh are we going to be funneled to specifc zones? Instead of being able to pick like in Legion?

[5:32:02] dwolters_the_zombieman: dragon riding got nerfed on top of drakthyr soar
[5:32:12] sLogOG: oh that's cool
[5:32:19] Sollice: @Luxicake Yes. There is a starting and end zone
[5:32:20] Brumbs: @Towelliee are you making a lock today by chance? :)
[5:32:21] xrandomdoodx: they probably nerfed dragonriding so they can add the speed back into the talent tree Kappa
[5:32:33] Luxicake: @Sollice gotcha thanks
[5:32:42] stubbedub: Hey just got here, did you the new dungeons yet?
