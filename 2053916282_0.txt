[0:21:12] Jackalope115: I usually believe in you Tommy but I started recently and the game tells you nothing
[0:21:19] mironp: The lack of knowledge in tarkov would fuck you over so much. It's not like corner strike game tells you nothing
[0:21:21] vacerss: if only i could find premades as melee anyway
[0:21:31] JohnTheTurtleMa: Cuz in my opinion peacetime trainig and tactics in the army are worth zero
[0:21:35] Nightbot: Help out this poor streamer by donating or subbing so he can get better quality for the best HOI4 gameplay.
[0:21:39] theMatvei: Naah no streamsniping in tarkov - too low odds of being in the same raid

[0:22:24] mironp: I don't think anyone beginning tarkov blind can do good
[0:22:29] JohnTheTurtleMa: Well i am leveraging from my experience in the army. The only thing i learned is how to clean the fool with dirty t shirts
[0:22:32] usg_ishimura_cpt: killing animals for sports is cringe jus like me
