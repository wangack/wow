[8:04:22] Thedruidtyler: A single night of no sleep will not stunt growth. But over the long term, a person's growth may be affected by not getting enough sleep. That's because growth hormone is normally released during sleep. If someone consistently gets too little sleep (known as "sleep deprivation"), growth hormone is suppressed.
