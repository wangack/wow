[1:26:46] Thuglyfe__: The Ballet was intense Desi. It had three parts with three intermissions, each with its own story to it. My favorite one was the second on Opioid addiction. Truly moving and inspiring. The human connection was so visceral, it was fantastic. These people are such tremendous athletes it had me thinking a lot about fitness (as usual). Just to be on some of the higher levels a physically fit body offers is The Joy of life itself. Incredible.

[7:30:26] DaStorminator: Sleeping bag quest is annoying NGL. For ally it starts in westfall, then go to Barrens, then go to Stonetalon Mountains, then go to Loch Modan, then border between Arathi and Hillsbrad
[7:30:58] mistersazo: going to make a coffee. Quieres uno? you want one*
[7:31:00] DaStorminator: I did it on 3 chars yesterday, but deff think it's worth investing time into. Since you provide bag for entire raid and buff lasts 2HR
