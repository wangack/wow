[5:14:12] KadiusFTW: @Bemoflas Almost like its IP creators were the creators of destiny as well
[5:14:12] well1: @w0rldss because the game name on twitch is just "Master Chief Collection", and people don't know the halo games that well, and join at different times
[5:14:14] Yippion: from a 2012 perspective, halo 4 was beasty asf
[5:14:15] Iliyuh: HALO DESTINY REACH OUT NOW

[5:14:32] infamousPanda57: @tehpenguofdoom yes
[5:14:33] FogLad: this was before destiny
[5:14:34] jasonwavess: Halo creators made destiny you zoomers.

[5:14:55] gr0pah: @well1 it literally says "Halo" in front of master chief collection 🙃
[5:14:55] w0rldss: @shroud change your title to halo 4 so 50% of the chat isnt asking what game this is lmao

[5:15:11] forthewin342: @shroud over charge a plasma pistol will EMP any vehicle
[5:15:12] sniff_mole: some of you guys exposing your age not knowing shit about halo lmao
[5:15:14] 2bzr: Halo reach the best for me
[5:15:14] well1: @gr0pah but it doesn't say "halo 4", which is what people ask, the collection is all of them
[5:15:19] DuCloud: @DAxREVENGER why not?
[5:15:19] asestec: the door
[5:15:19] chogun_rua: i just want this campaign to have more ammo then it would be more playable

[5:15:33] KadiusFTW: You keep walkinp past the door you need
[5:15:33] HypermoonTV: @brbplayingpc_ nah i was pretty good. Put probably 10k hours into halo 2 & 3. But 4 didn't have good comp multiplayer. No good maps. Hop in an hop out, literally no ranked system
[5:15:34] Sqeazu: big door hambW
[5:15:34] DAxREVENGER: did he play any of the other ones?
[5:15:35] aika_oink: go to that door
[5:15:35] OhYeahitsKT: MSM Kapp

[5:15:41] alps4: it simply a big door
[5:15:42] VMAN_1: Shroud turned into a bug
[5:15:42] AzSamurai: gotta be halo 5, yeah?
[5:15:43] haikusfrombuddha: @takeuchi_satomi It shouldn't be DMCA music. Haloe 4 just notoriously has the music set down by default.
[5:15:43] AzSamurai: no
[5:15:44] earcrowns: is this halo 8? jeez looks like it was made in 2012
[5:15:45] AzSamurai: nvm
[5:15:46] chogun_rua: theres a button that will tell you where to go too i think
[5:15:47] pavott: This is call of duty not infinite

[5:15:51] Chucky2sRevenge: doesnt even get ammo
[5:15:52] myegoschism: big sniper on ground near door
[5:15:52] jasonwavess: Only knowing destiny and not its relation to halo baby fetuses
[5:15:54] Red_Contagion: Only halo 5 campaign sucks
[5:15:54] rgisaxx: halo ends at halo reach
[5:16:04] zvenjersen: The levels sometimes are so messy
[5:16:08] shiba_chan: love it
[5:16:09] stiflingdig809: to anyone who hasn't played halo give it a shot worth it
[5:16:10] arcdirty: halo 1 remastered looks different
[5:16:11] pwncakes05: @well1 no not all of them lmfao. There is zero Halo 5 and people apparently dont know the difference between 4 and 5 nor the hud and art style between CE/2/3/ODST/Reach
[5:16:26] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[5:16:26] BurningTree92: that gun sounds like PEPELEPSY

[5:16:42] zaerfen: Gangstalking is real.
[5:16:42] bladesoul: Sound like a toy gun
[5:16:44] earcrowns: @pwncakes05 you realise not everyone has played any halo game, right? let alone all of the games enough to remember what hte huds look like in all of them
[5:16:45] wowshanksy: this is like a worse mass effect
[5:16:46] zvenjersen: I like that sound
[5:16:47] Ace_Carreno: Halo 5 movement is my favorite *unpopular opinion*
[5:16:49] DAxREVENGER: nah like did he play the others when they came out or did 343 pay him to play 4
[5:16:49] WarZo88: boring
[5:16:50] TatsCatsSats: Halo one of the best stories around
[5:16:54] Fata1moose: Halo 4 has too many corridors and not enough big sandbox/vehicle set pieces. The trench run at the end is fun.
[5:16:55] FungiCongroo: Pepega Pepega Pepega
[5:17:02] bluevolt20: haloooo

[7:55:43] Upgrayedd_710: Consoles seem good "for the price" until you calculate in 7 years of Online Services @ $60 a year.
[7:55:45] DaZooKidd420: Microsoft/Xbox is doing it right, ALL exclusives going to PC too
[7:55:48] GB3366: Cold War very underwhelming
