[1:07:53] DartG: @Projectdota the fear of getting hit with convoke and having the ability to heal to full, it's decent enough
[1:07:54] BlackStarGamer3: @RamboStallone Essentially, but unlike Cheat Death, it's not an instant heal. You regen 30% of your health over 10 seconds and if the seed takes a certain amount of damage in that time, you die
[1:07:55] aberinkulaz: By that logic every long cast time should do 20k+ dmg

But problem is in mmorpgs I love dungeons and learn the bosses weaknesses and etc but when I enter dungeons, other players rush like hell and they know everything every way and it’s not fun for me. Do you guys have any advices? Because I always get hit by newbie wall.
