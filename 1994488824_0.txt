[0:45:42] Kalderasch: @KingLeonida69 You can choose which expansion to play through while leveling now. And can also switch if you don't like what you chose first.
[0:45:45] Papapwnage: SoD Gaming!
[0:45:46] AJBungah: following since August 17th, 2010 - wow lol
[0:45:48] Is_Only_Game: danS
[0:45:49] javidesign95: i like to play a game but i cant not stop watching dan chill streams
[0:45:49] riley_bruce_: I used a follow date site. Was curious how long I've been watching Dan but have always enjoyed the streams
[0:45:52] SekretAznMan: Rreico modzK
[0:45:53] ChromaticCorps3: @lronhoover @oarens danWave danDuck danHug danLove
[0:45:56] menulo: @DansGaming how would you find it if you would just always level in azeroth and skip the expansions? untill the last levels for the current expansions ofc. leveling feels so disconnected
[0:45:58] riley_bruce_: @AJBungah nice!!
[0:46:06] LRonHoover: @ChromaticCorps3 danHi
[0:46:12] Oarens: ChromaticCorps3 good to see you danWave
[0:46:28] KingLeonida69: @kalderasch tyvm dude. That is a really good thing
[0:46:29] Papapwnage: @DansGaming are you finding your runes naturally or chat/google? That martyr one was so cryptic!
[0:46:39] CanadianUncleSam: Only 1 bar?! What is this, 2005?! :P
[0:47:14] menulo: tbh a lot of runes are prety much impossible to find without wowhead
[0:47:22] ghiblic: I mean, I would have been happy if they had some way to combine the early level players, and keep the leveling the same, no heirlooms or boosts
[0:47:26] altie1: It's also a paladin KEKW
[0:47:28] LRonHoover: FreakinStinkin üç∫ 3 bars woohoo!
[0:47:32] riley_bruce_: so in season of discovery you can get some of the abilities of other classes??
[0:47:37] Papapwnage: @menulo some you see and its obvious and some like... how would people find this?
[0:47:57] Papapwnage: @curious_turtle_ SoD is basically a private server where the rules no longer apply and its just for fun!
[0:48:10] riley_bruce_: interesting ok
[0:48:27] SaulGoodman_: They don't yet elaDespair location still unknown
[0:48:31] ghiblic: what I mean about combine early level players, is like they are all able to interact across servers/move servers so even if there isn't a ton of people leveling at that time it still feels like you have a lower level community as you are leveling
[0:48:44] Storyofa_Ginger: no one has actually found the warlock tanking rune
[0:48:48] altie1: Dual class
[0:48:50] Oztington: except nobody found the meta rune and locks cant tank
[0:48:56] BruceAllrighty: so there are 12 runes per class just in this early part of the season?
[0:49:01] Salladex: @curious_turtle_ basically it just a simple version of Ascension
[0:49:04] riley_bruce_: I stopped playing after Cataclysm sadly never got back into it. Lich King really grabbed me
[0:49:05] SaulGoodman_: No elaDespair
[0:49:10] coran_: coran_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 72 months! 
[0:49:16] Papapwnage: I know metamorph has been found
[0:49:20] MasqureMan: im on the warlock discord, it's chaos
[0:49:20] menulo: Yea its anoying, was hoping to level with that
[0:49:22] SaulGoodman_: It does, i rolled a lock to tank LUL
[0:49:29] LRonHoover: danCHAOS
[0:49:30] wtfblub: people are going mental over metamorph, theres multiple raids of people scanning every zone LUL
[0:49:48] Storyofa_Ginger: afaik they found items leading to it but haven't found it yet
[0:49:49] WeAreALLhuman: maybe gotta use Eye of Killrogg to get it.
[0:49:54] Papapwnage: @SaulGoodman_ have you seen the meme now of a warlock talking to a warrior "I am the tank now"
[0:49:56] ghiblic: or a very obvious place everyone overlooked
[0:49:59] everybodydance8: its a long chain quest that hasnt been finished
[0:50:17] Krolja: If it's anything like the Divine Storm rune it'll be quite a long/epic quesltine
[0:50:23] SaulGoodman_: No LUL @Papapwnage
[0:50:30] Papapwnage: Yeah divine storm takes hours
[0:50:35] Oztington: most of the runes for locks have been related to soul drain
[0:50:38] altie1: Breathe under water spell. It's in the sea!
[0:51:15] banadano: One of the druid ones requires you to eat mushrooms and talk to a frog  danK
[0:51:16] Cerala: I remember one raid in Wrath they let my warlock tank one of the bosses through her void. It was so neat
[0:51:34] LRonHoover: danK lick the frog
[0:52:14] Pbrad08: oh no, did hunter dan rip?
[0:52:19] Kalderasch: I was the warlock tank for my raid for one boss in Serpentshrine raid, many years ago.
[0:52:20] LRonHoover: danGnome wash yer beck
[0:52:35] javidesign95: i love strong berserker classes on video games
