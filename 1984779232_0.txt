[0:21:11] ThreesFG: only takes one pull
[0:21:13] bluedeep: how much of liquid is eu tho?
[0:21:14] bygodwest: NA servers would have to crash for 12 hours for trhem to catch up
[0:21:28] laaxxxd: liquid pulling off screen atm
[0:21:39] laaxxxd: so think they found something
[0:21:46] Rexy95: you think the could "solve" the raid release just by making an eu based server with NA reset timers and still keep other servers as is :)
[0:21:50] Rexy95: they*
[0:21:52] falldrgn: limit is a day ahead technically due to reset

[0:22:47] gorkamorka41782: Personally I think the Race is always dumb and hope it collapses and goes away lol
[0:22:47] Wildsmasher: back to no streaming then
[0:22:53] Tirfing_: Max was cooking hard during splits trying to figure out P2. Feel like he's had something in the works for a while
[0:22:54] Plague_GG: Didn’t Rasz die on a Saturday? Be kind of ironic if Fyrakk, her brother died on a Saturday too lol
[0:22:55] Nexxious: Im shocked they showed anything on the last boss on stream
[0:23:09] c0mmander_starscream: @Skizzurp He took that from Top Gun LUL

[0:26:07] prophitmoffett: the Blizzard Legacy Collection Trading Cards, is there a chance to get anything in game?
[0:26:08] TheUnknowing: with how much Gingi rages when they lose, doubt it
[0:26:10] Tirfing_: A year until next race is pretty long too.
[0:26:14] Morpheusx25: No king rules forever, perfectly discribes echo
[0:26:16] spekktrum19: that kill today took so much out of them emotionally
[0:26:26] c0mmander_starscream: maybe they'll quit and go play Lost Ark
[0:26:30] DunzoCD: yeah i didnt think they would survive the last one honestly they looked defeated
[0:26:33] spekktrum19: seeing Gingi post this morning that theyd have it dead within an hour of reaching the boss
[0:26:40] Wildsmasher: i still dont understand why EU and NA severs are just not connected by now D4 can do it so wow can too
[0:26:45] tebosteve: hey what's up what is that cuban category of stream?
[0:26:46] Kenz0v1: @Morpheusx25 so f*cking true mate
[0:26:46] spekktrum19: and it taking hours upon hours has to be demoralizing
[0:26:52] laaxxxd: but yea i think echo knows its over sine tswift kill to way to long

[1:31:12] metavahn231: echo is allowed to lose once LUL
[1:31:21] Scarhearth: Im likely guessing echo loses and gingi leaves because hes been saying apparently on his stream "fuck echo if we lose"
[1:31:37] Scarhearth: now whether thats just a rumor i dunno
[1:31:39] HyirGaming: Yeah, them keeping the raiders going for 20 hours is kinda crazy
