[1:27:57] bobthegoblin_: kicking 0.5 sec clones on NA is impossible
[1:28:02] Mykaels: playing on OCE it's standard; the worst is getting cloned when your character is behind a pillar :)
[1:28:10] Hemmis7: I saw chans healthstone go on cd when he died without healing him too
[1:28:17] Hemmis7: In the game you 2v3d them I think
[1:28:26] stowlen: chan is also used to kicking on 200ms
