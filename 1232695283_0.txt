[1:03:22] HeavenStorm: hit is right sorry
[1:03:24] naviewer: This is classic spell pen isnt a thing
[1:03:24] golden_bob: spell pen not really useful in classic
[1:03:34] Gheen0e: yes there is
[1:03:44] Netlikz: the av ring
[1:03:50] naviewer: It’s hit
[1:03:55] Aforemore: spell pen has to do with partials based on the resists of whoever you're fighting
[1:03:55] diabl712: there is spell pen in classic. Look at the av ring
[1:03:56] ATTFighter: if a spell resist that means it missed so u need +hit to reduce that chance.. i believe u only need 3% hit in pvp to not resist
[1:03:58] naviewer: 6% cap for pvp
[1:04:00] ATTFighter: its simple
[1:04:03] yeeterson301: 3% hit talent is v good, there’s a trinket that reduces enemy resists from WSG
[1:04:04] naviewer: Promise
[1:04:07] Gheen0e: 1000% there is spell pen in classic...look at AV ring

[1:09:05] Sakrasta: AV ring is really good, if the opponent has 20 resistance they take 5% less damage on average. So reducing that to 0 is a solid dps boost.

[1:23:05] EliBourne: theres no fun in ranking 14 in one day
[1:23:22] diabl712: there is no fun in ranking to 14 at all LOL
[1:23:31] WarriorChik: lol
[1:23:41] EliBourne: kinda true lol
[1:23:48] moonsalt44: no ranking points is doubled - decay is 40%
[1:23:53] ZergyMan: Its good to rank up-.. Shows what you do 24/7 of the day LUL
[1:24:01] EliBourne: i gave up at rank 10 in the first classic
[1:24:04] whipoholic: what server are you on ? always wanted to play with the legendary swifty
[1:24:13] Gizimoo86: still need to play 6 hours for sure per day to keep even rank
[1:24:16] Galdrena: !som
[1:24:16] StreamElements: Swifty is on Nightfall (PVP) Horde for Seasons of Mastery. Guild "Sovereign". Discord discord.gg/sovereigngaming
[1:24:31] Sakrasta: Decay is doubled but the rp gains as well. So if you would gain 20% in the old system now you gain 40%. But if you would have lost 20% you will lose 40% now. So the new system is even worse than the old one if you start deranking.
[1:24:44] WarriorChik: Hola Galdrena!
[1:24:46] JayBinski: you can rank casually plaing 6-8hrs a day
[1:24:53] Galdrena: hey @WarriorChik !
[1:25:00] JayBinski: it just won't be fast

[1:25:05] Shakeboxing: G'day Swifty
[1:25:11] Kramgoing: Rank 1-14 3 1/2 month maxing bracket every week, scouting with 4 accounts, both factions, stalking oposite faction to maximize world pvp honor, that’s what I call pvp.
[1:25:16] golden_bob: yeah the decay is much worse now
[1:25:27] diabl712: @JayBinski it will be slow and your  max rank will be low because your bracket will be low
[1:25:32] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[1:25:55] Gizimoo86: Its season of meta so people play crazy hours to get best gear from pvp ranks
[1:26:13] baraktus: i think payo has some stream sniper to
[1:26:17] Kramgoing: Seems like they just want to force ppl play even more with the decay.
[1:26:31] Sakrasta: That moment when people call 8 hours a day casual ranking.
[1:26:32] weipengbird: !uptime
[1:26:33] StreamElements: @weipengbird, swifty has been streaming for  1 hour 26 mins
[1:26:45] Gizimoo86: Yeah they made raiding harder and pvp ranking "easier" so it was bad choice for blizzard
[1:26:47] rbubbaray: If they dont make things rasier and faster now , people will quit , cause classic was a grind
[1:27:12] hntrrrxo: r14 swifty sham??? upcoming!
[1:27:13] rbubbaray: the only reasom there is players is the hardcore thing
[1:27:18] JayBinski: It's not going to be 1m caps every week, people are losing their minds over a non thing, AV weekend when every person in the world thinks it's easy to rank is not the standard, just pvp and have fun, see how fast you gain rank, you'll be supprised
[1:27:40] diabl712: its over 1mill cap
[1:27:55] Yougotpced: Man Swifty, only if you knew since when I am following you on Twitch, actually can you see that ?
[1:27:59] Gizimoo86: Naah some people will play 3 months or more with crazy grinds
[1:28:03] AlexG0606: Its 1.7Mil cap br1 on Jom
[1:28:08] moonsalt44: it was over 1 mil cap last week too, and im on a  smaller eu realm
[1:28:24] Hyelander_: @JayBinski Thats just a feel good statement and totally untrue about progression
[1:28:30] rbubbaray: what suckes is ur compting against the other players in the ranks
[1:29:01] Herzenliegen: @Yougotpced dince 2014
[1:29:05] Skullie333: much love swifty!

[1:30:58] rbubbaray: man seems the only wow streamer playing new world now is xaryu
[1:30:58] diabl712: nah the people who get rank 14 will take a week off and sleep
[1:31:02] angryhatter: just gonna wait to buy the rank
[1:31:10] prokiper: 1600minutes
[1:31:11] Yougotpced: easy go for it haha
[1:31:12] Malltis: 13 to be safe
[1:31:30] kermellia: hi master =)
[1:31:31] Herzenliegen: Honestly, I get people love to pvp but over 14 hours a day is just way to much. That's asking a lot of your family or loved ones.
[1:31:39] rotor__1: Are u having fun swifty?

[1:34:20] rbubbaray: I wanted all the pvp gear thou
[1:34:22] Kiexi: every serious raider has to rank pretty much
[1:34:22] mangoessgreen: use the honor calc to see where you will be
[1:34:32] missalexia1988: I look at it this way, I can run AVs all day while I'm at work, 20-30 minute queues for Alliance, so plenty of time to do actual work
[1:34:36] bayther729: never say never swifty
[1:34:37] baronashbury: i honestly prefer retail pvp over classic pvp, like classic pvp seems kinda dull and one sided.
[1:34:39] RBGordOz: Hey Swifty, do u think SoM is worth it ? or is just another blizz flop? im enjoying very much dont get me wrong
[1:34:44] rbubbaray: yeah but SOM they said the grind was faster
[1:34:50] PapaBeks: after you get 14,. are you ever going to come back to retail?
[1:34:58] angryhatter: i stopped leveling on the spot, i wish it just had some sort of system to reward players skill wise
[1:35:00] Enmael00: and SO ENDS the High Warlord Peanut Dream... SAD

[3:26:35] eshonxyz: cmon the levelling wasnt that bad i enjoyed it why not just put in a boost you can buy at that point
[3:26:46] steffaboiii: the most interesting part is that they got direct feedback about the problem the 2 resets, but they refused to look at it for another week lol
[3:27:15] EliBourne: WotLK was a good questing expansion
[3:27:15] haileyxzx: Damn just got banned for 8 days, reason? Pvp afk or something lol alot of people getting spam reported and getting banned for no reason

[3:31:31] kets70: but its classic
[3:31:32] eshonxyz: thats by design, if its longer you get to many name paltes stacking on your screen
[3:31:35] Djinx_o: ye I hate it
[3:31:39] Lindbombaa: /script C_CVar.SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance", 41)
[3:31:41] rolexoww: you can still make it to 40 doh
[3:31:46] Lindbombaa: use this /script C_CVar.SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance", 41)
[3:31:53] rbubbaray: there is a fw on my server at R11
[3:32:00] rolexoww: you need to change setting to get it to 40 even in classic
[3:32:30] thamysticog: i hate hunters as a priest LUL

[3:35:02] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:35:44] eshonxyz: like if u have infinite range on nameplates they used to all stack ontop of eachother and fill the entire screen, but yeah 20 yards is to small lol
[3:35:53] eshonxyz: i play as hunter and it annoying yeah
[3:36:23] rbubbaray: these devs running the game now ruined everything good

[16:18:09] Hesteria1: What is the add on that give enemy list names ? Its existe in tbc ? @swifty
[16:18:11] Sakrasta: Season 2 of SoM will be super unpopular, because it will collide with WotLK.
[16:18:52] frozenpizza2209: We only need 10-20k for SoM to have awesome bg ques, so it doesnt matter
[16:18:56] NicolaiHerforth: how do you mean it wasnt what it was supposed to be? -the leveling
[16:18:57] back2r00ts: they might change talents in SOM 2
[16:19:00] Nathramas: the 40% doesnt feel much faster
[16:19:02] Mindhun7er: It was slow still..
[16:19:02] Auxilius: this is classic plus ?
[16:19:15] frozenpizza2209: We dont know if we get wotlk 2023
[16:19:24] pirryxd: !followage
[16:19:24] Ajarezz: @Auxilius More like Classic minus
[16:19:40] frozenpizza2209: I hope they give us release day of SoM2, max 1-2 months after som1
[16:19:40] Sakrasta: 40% bonus xp to quests only is almost nothing, should be 100% to everything or more. Make leveling take 30-40 hours and not 100+

[16:20:17] step_mofos: @Sakrasta well don't play classic and play cheap retail pls
[16:20:52] frozenpizza2209: I think the 40% to quests really did it. Dont buff it more.
[16:20:54] Auxilius: so you like healing wave over lesser or chain heal?
