[0:42:02] silverback1977: game is designed like 1 tank + 1 healer + 3 dps in mind of the developers. if tank made dmg like dd you would easily beat every dungeon with 4 tank + 1 heal or 5 tank. or easy raid bosses with 15 tanks + 5 healers
[0:42:12] Renco_S: i know @Linodinosaur i was messin with ya
[0:42:30] HarveyPls: bad pull out
[0:42:32] OverFeatured: in season 1 i did a 20+ halls with 4 tanks and one dps XD
[0:42:34] Thuretical: pull out game
[0:42:48] Skorgg: he isn’t saying tanks should do the same dps as a dps class. just that raid damage shouldn’t be dps at 600k and tank at 130k
[0:42:54] ItsYent: @silverback1977  he was legit saying balance lmao. if people did 70% of a DPS that doesn’t mean you’d automatically bring 5 tanks
[0:43:11] OverFeatured: wow this adds is hitting like a truck
[0:43:16] Linodinosaur: but i guess the more serious take is like i understand dps would feel worse if a tank outdpsed them but if tanks dont do a decent of damage it also wouldnt be fun to play IMO
[0:43:18] ItsYent: you bring 5 tanks doing 70% of a DPS you’d never time the key
[0:43:28] HarveyPls: i wonder how high 5 vdh could go tbh

[0:44:20] silverback1977: @ItsYent plus pvp problems of course
[0:44:29] ItsYent: they have a pvp modified
[0:44:29] Thatsafy: pvp OMEGALUL
[0:44:34] ItsYent: modifier
[0:44:48] schaller670: hear me out .....when are they going to give a tank lust
[0:44:51] solix2123: I'm always going for as much damage as I can for tank, which is why I want to know when to sprit bomb vs soul cleave i've just assumed soul cleave 3 or less targets sprit bomb 4 or more
[0:44:54] Linodinosaur: isnt tanks legit useless almost for pvp because of the pvp modifier?
[0:45:06] krash25: what max key can 5 tanks time
[0:45:07] AdiXIV: Is your font open to public? is it in the UI folder?
[0:45:18] solix2123: in Ui folder @AdiXIV
[0:45:23] snapz251: I dont get your take, doing 20k more on a tank is as important for the key as a dps doing 20k more, so it does matter imo
[0:45:24] ItsYent: @krash25  sub 20s
[0:45:38] solix2123: there is a guide on how to get everything exactly the same @AdiXIV
[0:45:57] Linodinosaur: @krash25 there was a stream by nate (think he is method?) who did 5 tanks keys above 20s but i dont remember the exact keys they were able to time
[0:46:13] AdiXIV: @solix2123 I already have the ui but I was curious if it was available as usable font in general

[0:46:34] zeoliveirajunior: the priest

[0:46:58] 9hoowl: which tank is the most boring shit to play?
[0:47:00] Renco_S: or dps should just get good so they dont get gapped by the tank
[0:47:03] fremen14: @9hoowl guardian
[0:47:07] IRLAnthiel: any key that can be done without a third dps can be timed with 5 tanks
[0:47:08] nuggetpriest: how many channel points do i need for a 28 key bost im 3.3k io 100k?
[0:47:14] Rodyyy__: how can you ignore the totem? o_O
[0:47:20] Linodinosaur: @Rodyyy__ parry
[0:47:23] solix2123: @snapz251 the more damage your doing as a tank the faster they key will go if your DPS are doing the damage they are supposed  to then why wouldn't it be a good thing? mobs die faster you take less damage just good all around
[0:47:24] ffauziakmal: naowh the beast tank in the world <3

[0:59:14] MightyGIGACHAD: your shot caller automatically loses 10-15% dps

[0:59:54] thinkaliens: @9hoowl I think most high end players will tell you this is a very bad idea.  gingi has said he never wants a tank shotcalling before
[1:00:32] solix2123: being a tank and a shot caller is  makes your job so much harder and you end up making mistakes which gets you killed and if tank dies a lot of time its a team wipe
[1:00:38] molletta_again: lthe thing that tank have to be the caller is the dumbest shit
[1:00:42] solix2123: hard to focus on living and shot calling at the same time
[1:00:56] PoutDer: Just ends up that way in most pugs though
[1:01:04] Linodinosaur: ^
[1:01:17] solix2123: everyone follows the leader in pugs which happens to be the tank lol

[1:01:41] nppp: I mean the nerf team disbanded pretty much because he didnt want to shot call anymore as a tank
[1:01:44] ren0m: Chat, I plan to start tanking M+ (1st time); where can I find routes and other useful things I can learn before then? Going in blind just doesn't seem like a good idea.
[1:01:56] solix2123: let me call out this color of grass since its all i can see
[1:02:01] Renco_S: be like me and just pull for the tank, pull waay more than the tank can handle, wipe and go agane in a new group

[1:02:10] pricebanana: catJAM
[1:02:11] PoutDer: @ren0m Think Dratnos usually have routes that are descent for pugs
[1:02:26] NippoTV: @ren0m keystone guru is a good start
[1:02:41] Linodinosaur: @ren0m there are weekly routes on raiderio, made by bunten which arent bad at all there are also some made my dratnos which also are good. If you wanna get into the nitty gritty you can watch video guides on the dungeons as well.
[1:02:45] ren0m: @PoutDer So as a tank, I should memorise all routes?
[1:02:52] ren0m: @NippoTV Thank you i'll check it out
[1:02:53] IRLAnthiel: healers are just cheerleaders anyways, better to have them talking the group through encounters

[1:03:28] NippoTV: @ren0m yw, dont forget to select season 3 in the top bar :P otherwise you get routes for wrong dungeons
[1:03:35] miiloevan: whats your stats?
[1:03:35] solix2123: @ren0m just pull as you see fit, honestly until you get into high keys a lot of routes don't work unless you have a coordinated group
[1:03:35] ren0m: @Linodinosaur Oh nice, thank you. I didn't know raiderio has those.
[1:03:44] dnlegend: GZ with MDI
[1:03:48] psokys: did you guys see the guy on youtube vod of mdi gettin really mad they did the portal stuff :D
[1:03:51] molletta_again: @nppp yeah, but you talk that after key and off live
[1:03:52] Linodinosaur: @ren0m the more you tank the more you will just remember them by heart but making routes and going by routes made by other ppl and looking at them beforehand is always good. But you shouldnt feel like you are being bad by not already knowing all the routes it takes time.

[1:06:05] ren0m: @solix2123 @Linodinosaur You just feel like an ass for wasting your group's time. But you're right, with time you probably get a feel for it :)
[1:06:14] molletta_again: @Linodinosaur what team he is in'
[1:06:23] Linodinosaur: @Linodinosaur honestly dont remember PepeLaugh
[1:06:25] ren0m: I might as well wait for S4 since we're at the end of S3 anyway.
[1:06:28] solix2123: @ren0m don't worry to much about a certain route until you know the dungeon pretty well and get a good feel for it
[1:06:31] PoutDer: @ren0m Sometimes they are just gonna be happy to find a tank tbh
[1:06:50] ren0m: @PoutDer lol true
[1:06:57] molletta_again: @Linodinosaur love his streams to the moon
[1:07:01] Linodinosaur: @ren0m i know the feeling, doing a route you know by heart and then you are 1% off and have to go to narnia to get the last % sucks but it happens to the best of us lmao
[1:07:10] ren0m: @solix2123 I'll probably spam lower M+ to get a feel for dungeons. It's probably the best call
[1:07:25] solix2123: @ren0m its not being an ass, everyone has to learn somehow and even if you look up a route you wont pull it off perfect first time. Just have fun with it learn the pulls and mechanics etc and when you are really comftrable then go for it!
[1:07:29] solix2123: and yea thats why i did
[1:07:40] Linodinosaur: @ren0m good idea, but dont expect them to do any hard pulls or skips they always ass pull smth
[1:07:41] solix2123: just spammed a bunch of 10s I don't want to mess up anyones 20s
[1:07:58] solix2123: plus the timer is a lot more forgiving in lower keys so its okay to make mistakes
[1:08:13] solix2123: plus in lower keys people tend to be a lot more understanding of someone still learning
[1:08:38] molletta_again: @solix2123 are u sure? .D
[1:08:52] Linodinosaur: PepeLaugh
[1:08:55] solix2123: @molletta_again not always

[1:11:40] ren0m: And I guess playing off-meta is fine as long as you're not doing +28s
[1:11:56] Avengedhonor: padding the meters

[1:12:11] Linodinosaur: its just not common bc ppl wanna do keys as easy as possible
[1:12:13] Linodinosaur: with the best comp
[1:12:17] ren0m: Oh its guardian now :P

[1:12:50] Linodinosaur: besides just padding
[1:12:53] ItsYent: a guardian Druid has one of the R1 keys lol. you can be off meta 100%
[1:12:55] sharpair: Priority damage is more important
[1:12:57] ren0m: I thought Guardians and other off-meta tanks were just not able to tank. So the meta is more about what people know works?

[1:13:43] ItsYent: before s3 people thought bear was giga dead but it’s not
[1:13:51] Linodinosaur: when you start getting into 30s is when keys start wanting specific classes for skips etc
[1:13:54] ren0m: @ItsYent I've heard it's in a good spot
[1:14:08] JerBoody: playing “off meta” is always fine. people put too much stock in it. yes you’re a bit more likely to get invited as meta, but 99% of what YOU can achieve is based on YOUR ability to, not the class/spec you play
[1:14:09] solix2123: My messages keep getting flagged :( I was calling myself the not smart word
[1:14:19] ren0m: I think I'm a couple of months away from doing close to 30s :)

[1:16:11] Linodinosaur: the enthusiasm is good but 30s are alot harder than being 2.4k. I would look for a closer goal before that like 3k > 3.3k > 3.5k > 3.8k smth like that
[1:16:23] Linodinosaur: going from 2.4k io to 30s within a few months is ALOT of work
[1:16:28] Avengedhonor: you did lol
[1:16:53] trenbolon408: looked like it
[1:16:54] Avengedhonor: you jump close to them
[1:16:58] ren0m: I hope I have enough time to push to 3k, just to see if I can do it. But I felt an increase in difficulty from 15 up. I can imagine anything above 20 is far more challenging.
[1:16:58] Ziane: fat assed it I think
[1:16:58] JerBoody: @waies haha yea that’s the 1% though…you do have your own key as well
[1:16:59] kosalol1: bodypull yea
[1:17:00] Hregoth: gateway maybe
[1:17:07] daevyfan: you yumped
[1:17:15] sharpair: 2k is 13/14 keys, 2.5k is 16/17ish and 3k is 22/23 keys
[1:17:17] Avengedhonor: Mdi player btw
[1:17:19] Avengedhonor: lol

[1:17:43] ren0m: At least I did 16-18s this week
[1:17:50] JerBoody: @waies and why tf would anyone actually play WW?
[1:18:06] kosalol1: only 1 abo extra since 1 caster still in house
[1:18:10] t0ffin: t0ffin subscribed with Prime. 
[1:18:35] sharpair: WW is very good, just other classes are better
[1:19:25] JerBoody: I mean unless it was actually meta…WW sucks bawls to play though, objectively
[1:19:32] Discpic: oom haHAA
[1:19:40] rootkit1337tv: going from 2.4k to 30s is the same jump in scale as going from driving 100 kilometers to the distance between earth and the sun

[1:20:16] ItsYent: pushing high keys depends on having a great group. you can get away with one or two people carrying in lower keys but later on it’s super hard to carry someone
[1:20:19] Escandalo_: top zone is 22%
[1:20:32] solix2123: Finding a group is the problem lol
[1:20:34] sharpair: It's pretty easy to reach 2.7-2.8 without trying. My gf reached 2.7 on hunter and she knows half the mechanics :D
[1:20:38] solix2123: or at least in my experince
[1:20:41] RaxxFPS: 28 and up, maybe not in BRH and AD but most keys requires a shit ton of minmaxing and utility usage. One wipe and your done most of the time.

[1:21:29] ItsYent: it also takes forever to get your key up that high and once it’s up there people aren’t that reluctant to put it in LFG … well EU is built different . NA it’s a lot harder cuz players are worse lol

[1:53:46] Arisolo: i think last hope getting second shows a serious problem with the MDI. their routes were all bad, but they just didn't wipe.
[1:54:12] Arisolo: people getting punished for cooking. its why TGP is more interesting
[1:54:28] eCorbo: yop naowh u play offensif build ?
[1:54:32] ottomr1990: you don't get punished for cooking.  that's what you practice 14 hours a day for
[1:54:37] spannker_: I think all the monk DMG is from diffuse magic Kappa
[1:54:38] moodsen: ppl got punished not for cooking but for overcooking / burning
[1:54:41] ottomr1990: if you mess up then you didn't practice it enough
[1:54:55] Erickwow44: mind soothe?
[1:54:59] KaiaGT: @Arisolo in my opinion MDI is about cooking crazy pulls/skips
[1:55:00] momrider: @Arisolo I mean thats literally the point right? You can go faster but its not consistent. It's just strategy
[1:55:18] breaccglas123: Nice haircut bro
[1:55:30] dominopomino: you have to really hug the wall
[1:55:33] Erickwow44: Soo fat
[1:55:38] KDaily: your fat butt
[1:55:41] Arisolo: @ottomr1990 the routes that won were by and large boring. legendary and dawgs had the coolest routes+echo's rise, but pressing W and playing 4 dps was just better most of the time
[1:55:42] Kraidyy: you can just cage the most right one

[1:56:55] KaiaGT: @Arisolo I mean, not every key has to be super fun to watch in the MDI format. Some keys are more fun to watch in another settings
[1:56:59] Arisolo: @sw0ngs no. the format allows for 5 hours, not head to head so you get rewarded for pushing
[1:56:59] moodsen: @Arisolo and then u realise that last hope NEVER played 4 dps ... holy chat is yapping Chatting Chatting
[1:57:00] ottomr1990: @Arisolo some truth to that but i think that's largely generalizing.  there were a lot of times where you'd see both teams doing the exact same pull, and one just couldn't handle it, and that was the diff in the match

[2:01:57] mbc0794: classic wipe
[2:01:59] silverback1977: it's only 29 how should they know mechanics?
[2:02:00] bremek0: :O
[2:02:06] OverFeatured: they dont want do less dps instead clear
[2:02:06] vohellion: holy shit man this mage is a classic dmg whore cuz he is onstream wants to show off
[2:02:09] ottomr1990: @NiborWoW DH definitely more self sufficient, but pally helps your group a ton more if you don't need the mob control DH gives you
[2:02:13] Drax_1224: i only do 20s and know to clear under the boss
[2:02:15] Daxtez: classic
[2:02:17] sdarknes01: classic of that dungeon
[2:02:22] Erickwow44: MDI player toxic?

[2:02:53] Erickwow44: Hahaha I love u
[2:02:58] OverFeatured: i dont understar why players prefer to do dps instead clear
[2:02:59] Jim_Boozie: greeding cast > clearing ground classic
[2:03:00] spannker_: The pool under the boss after ur chains on mobs... they might didndt had they monitors on to see that pool Kappa
[2:03:01] voldeekay: thats not toxic people do not do the single mechanic on that game :D
[2:03:05] Vitaminw1: hey naowh is sweden a good spot for a vacation
[2:03:07] OverFeatured: dead dps dont kill boss and dont do dps
[2:03:10] Olivens: dps players, nothing new
[2:03:12] maaraad: not blaming uou
[2:03:13] valk113: its one thing when you get the bug where it Cant clear even when your standing in the pool.

[2:03:48] butter51: the fucked part was someone booping all the adds directly under the boss, no one knew where to clear at that point because they couldn't see it and they thought the room was clear. sad
[2:03:49] hunterzx: stacking clearers isn't bad, problem is when they stop moving or dont stand in poop
