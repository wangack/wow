[0:26:11] goombacci: 6
[0:26:12] Zarjanda: 6
[0:26:18] Reydien: the main part is that Primes and Gift subs = 0 pointws
[0:26:19] foxsunalpha: I'll dm you in discord soon.
[0:26:34] Zarjanda: its right below the table
[0:26:34] Reydien: they want you to get recurring payments tied to you
[0:27:09] prttykttygrl: Its been that way for prime subs for a while
[0:27:22] Nyurro: true
[0:27:23] reggiepowa: they are subbed to prime and amazon is giving streamer that money
[0:27:31] Blanketboi: i try and hold if for wowgrandma if i can remember

[0:31:01] goombacci: 3.5
[0:31:03] prugar: 3.5

[0:32:38] Flipeled: @Diazanite no, twitch gets 55% and streamer gets 45%
[0:32:39] Diazanite: oh right
[0:32:40] goombacci: I guess I have to sub to streamers I like with real subs and to streamers I barely like with prime

[0:34:19] Flipeled: @Maximum EU wasn't getting paid in dollars anyway
[0:34:29] NaGirreK: @maximum you have to consider that most countries especially europe already got adjusted subscription prices. for germany it's already at 4 euros per sub

[0:34:43] goombacci: @sebby997 yeah this is making kick happy ig
[0:35:18] miniath_: even if the biggest streamers will be fine,there exists a group of people who this hurts to the point where streaming isnt viable likely
[0:35:19] termo1425: eu people also have less primes though, Becuase there less people that have Amazon prime
[0:35:22] Camelbak21: Prime is kind of a meme in europe tho, amazon only supports certain countries
[0:35:23] mBeacham: Feels like if anyone has a dream to become a full-time streamer in 2024 that dream is that much more impossible to reach
[0:35:25] Archmage_Michael: @litixio why? rich people have higher expenses. car leases, mortgages, clothes, etc ;-)
[0:35:26] TuskAroni: @Maximum wont that depends on how much is twitch getting from amazon prime for allowing this prime sub? Pretty sure this is just twitch wanting more of the cut. Assuming there is a deal

[0:42:20] eviljuju_eu: xD
[0:42:22] Zarjanda: I wonder what it would have looked like if you had to follow the 100k rule and if the prime nerf is worse or better than that old rule
[0:42:23] Pyrrha_GG: twitch aura nerfed maxs income
[0:42:24] Kamehameshaw: wait sookie got laid off?

[0:43:20] cosmo30k: you are sauced
[0:43:20] biglonelytv: same

[0:43:50] Alephmempe: #PALZ4LIFE
[0:43:53] rhaiven95: a streamer gets 40€ form liquid?

[0:43:54] Hoaw: @Mani1301 u just gave up the fact that u r like 10 years old
[0:43:56] luxumbra69: really surprised youtube is so lucrative compared to twitch.

[0:43:56] smoothlol: damn max making a milly a month ??
[0:43:59] Yarbek: Yarbek subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:44:05] TheLuo: How would you feel if twitch asked for a % of the $ you get from sponsorships you do on twitch?
[0:44:13] miniath_: moon2NOO
[0:44:14] TimmayHS: 300k sponsorships holy
[0:44:19] Mazmerized: They just do through discord now right?
[0:44:21] Faraday5001: Kevs hard pushing his patreon
[0:44:27] Mani1301: @Hoaw you're
[0:44:28] Sover31gn: I just wire transferred a clean $1.4 dollars to your bank account
[0:44:36] Dreadlol: onlyfans ui
[0:44:37] Squats3: oh yeah... i just swapped over to a discord sub for atrocity. ive been using my prime on him for like a year
[0:44:39] miniath_: i gave money to kevin through patreon for the homies
[0:44:39] Vegard10101: sub to onlyfans for UI
[0:44:42] Zaisx: I subbed to Kev's patreon give him a little support
[0:44:42] TimmayHS: and people will still say this isn't a "real job"
[0:44:47] cosmo30k: time for a bounty boys
[0:44:48] gonzobone: diversify ui guy is hurt most by this change
[0:44:48] casca322: lol 1.4
[0:44:50] awesomeoohh: hey max how are RWF profits split amongst liquid raiders?
[0:44:56] CreeLegacy: twitch is being digging is own grave for a while at this point
[0:44:56] NaGirreK: i mean the bigger streamers suffer harder from that right? since small streamers get better rates like 60/40 or 70/30 easier. if you are above that threshold you get smacked harder
[0:44:59] TimmayHS: do you still get imposter syndrome?
[0:45:02] cosmo30k: @gonzobone LUL
[0:45:07] Mazmerized: time for another gw2 lower third >:)
[0:45:09] fourohsicks: is kevsp some shadow priest alt from liquid? was in one of my pugs the other day lmao @Maximum
[0:45:14] goombacci: you would just do them on youtube
[0:45:15] Vxfboy: I like how transparent you're about this most streamers would never open up about their income
[0:45:17] miniath_: thats basically the bounty system no?
[0:45:35] Reydien: Twitch wanted to do that, they tried to ban third-party advertising on twitch
[0:45:41] ufwcode: do we get an irl horse for two gifted
[0:45:44] Reydien: then it got blasted and they retracted 48 hours later
[0:45:48] flakaflak: @Maximum  so in europe, the amazon prime sub increaced to ~ 50E, and using twich prime sub got nerfed for streamers ... ggs
[0:45:49] Squats3: they did that for like.. banner ads and whatnot. but i think it would be WAY to hard to police them taking $ from sponsorships
[0:45:57] TheLuo: Bounties back in Reckful's day were the bread n butter
[0:46:06] gonzobone: are they doing local pricing for prime now? if that's the case it may end up being more of a wash than it seems at first glance
[0:46:06] miniath_: sure they fuck you but in essence thats what it is, twitch taking a cut for a sponsorship
[0:46:11] TheLuo: been a LOOONG time since I looked at anyones twitch breakdown
[0:46:14] teezboi: I
[0:46:15] goombacci: byron FeelsStrongMan
[0:46:18] JustJoshin____: can you deliver the horse to a PO Box?
[0:46:23] Darkenet: Sadge
[0:46:26] Archmage_Michael: income nerfed means walking around instead of flying. sadge
[0:46:30] sebby997: What are bounties?
[0:46:34] misfitstv1: we are farmers
[0:46:37] luxumbra69: "made up" numbers
[0:46:38] Squats3: (the numbers are not made up)
[0:46:40] Kamehameshaw: real numbers KEKW
[0:46:44] goombacci: @Archmage_Michael means more mobile ad shilling
[0:46:52] Squats3: he added a 0 this time
[0:46:52] Spinerek: real numbers
[0:47:04] TimmayHS: It's really hard to conceptualize how companies can afford to pay so much for an ad like that. It must be effective, but I just can't see it. I'll never play raid shadow legends.
[0:47:11] Vxfboy: Wait twitch pays you to play a game on stream?
[0:47:26] prugar: Max isn't good at making shit up so they are real chat
[0:47:27] goombacci: modified by an algorithm monkaHmm
[0:47:29] Connor_Quest: 2 grand for an hour? I'd still do it lol
[0:47:32] itsCelivan: @TimmayHS whales
[0:47:33] NaGirreK: that's why most streamers who have bounties available do them when they get raided to get the most from it
[0:47:38] Reydien: @Vxfboy when the game dev/publisher pays twitch to get the game played, yes
[0:47:38] biglonelytv: RAID SHADOW LEGENDS Pog
[0:47:38] JWallace: 2 grand an hour, I’m in
[0:47:42] Kamehameshaw: thats because Raid Shadow Legends is more profitable than most service games because of their ingame monetization. They can literally burn ad money and still profit
[0:47:45] Vegard10101: Waid Wadhow Wegends
[0:47:46] Shadowgames47: this is weird I’ve just watched your videos on YouTube
[0:47:47] kolas1: Just leveled to 60, havent touched retail for 10+ years.. what are you guys doing at 70 as casuals?
[0:47:58] nightst314: if they get 1% to dump their wallet, they have won
[0:48:02] smolderdaddyuwu: @kolas1 professions
[0:48:05] litixio: passive income forever
[0:48:06] forshard: ethical advertising
[0:48:06] goombacci: and all the people that would be interested already have seen the ads though
[0:48:08] CanielD: Data shows. Its all about the numbers.
[0:48:09] miniath_: if they caught one whale they feasting for months
[0:48:09] Dzor12: @kolas1 low level M+, normal and heroic raids
[0:48:13] Shadowsrith: @kolas1 transmog and mount runs
[0:48:14] Chaosbites: @Maximum did you forget to take off the horse add or can we gift 2 subs for horse while you are playing wow?
[0:48:15] Joneim: @kolas1 Mount and rep farming, collecting pets / transmog etc
[0:48:26] malnourish_: all u need is like 40 whales
[0:48:29] Diocaska: It's hooking the "whales"
[0:48:30] Darkenet: kolas1 Profs, low keys, normal raids, farm old stuff for collectibles
[0:48:34] Squats3: I think every company's dream is to become a household name and no longer need a huge advertising budget.
[0:48:35] Reydien: the average Raid user spends something stupid like $25 on the game.  if they can get 1,000 people to join, that's $25K in expected value
[0:48:37] goombacci: havent the 3% already seen all the ads for it though? what are more ads gonna do now?
[0:48:39] CreeLegacy: are you guys gonna set up some sort of event for the faded tiers re release?
[0:48:43] BigTrout3: YEP all it takes is 1 whale per 1000 players and they're living the dream
[0:48:44] TimmayHS: I pay to avoid ads, are most of you guys not the same?
[0:48:48] oldladygaming_: hey. congratz on your streamer awards nomination!
[0:48:57] sebby997: I dont think you realise just how much whales pay...Genshin is full of them and they are making ABSURD amounts of money
[0:49:03] TheBroCrow: @Maximum do a raid shadow legends stream tallying up how much you have to spend to max out
[0:49:03] TimmayHS: that's so wild
[0:49:08] DranixOverlord: Permaban that person
[0:49:08] Squats3: was that the strea myou did with thd?
[0:49:09] Szain3: DinoDance
[0:49:16] TheLuo: Max idk why you bother with all this twitch stuff. Just find spoiled produce at the store, buy it, and return it for double your money back. ez
[0:49:27] TimmayHS: I guess as a poor person, I just can't easily imagine it.
[0:49:29] luxumbra69: when are you getting IO from group finder n00b?
[0:49:29] goombacci: I doubt they hadnt seen a raid ad before with hoe common they are
[0:49:29] biglonelytv: I wish I could get into that mindset
[0:49:44] DatRippelEffect: there's that one dude who spent 6 figures on diablo immortal. forgot the name of the streamer
[0:49:49] goombacci: @luxumbra69 why are you complaining about more content?
[0:49:54] Rusulake: i know people who spent 20k usd on a mobile game in a monthish
[0:49:55] Hugejorma: I can't even buy a $30 game Sadge
[0:50:02] luxumbra69: i play WoW because i'm broke.
[0:50:04] miniath_: frickin elon bought twitter for like 44billion cause he felt like it
[0:50:11] Kamehameshaw: Didnt quin spend an ungodly amount of money getting some maxed out gem?
[0:50:12] goombacci: @Rusulake quin TrollDespair
[0:50:18] TimmayHS: Yea at least wow lets you play for free
[0:50:22] Vegard10101: @miniath_ he bought it cuz he couldnt back out of the buy
[0:50:26] biglonelytv: TRUE
[0:50:27] m1lkman10: What a comment
[0:50:28] OG_Kawngi: HOLY
[0:50:29] Darkenet: HUH
[0:50:30] Graidon: @luxumbra69 nah, if you were broke you wouldn't play wow

[0:51:09] Therealbrokensword: but wouldnt you need the receipt showing that you got it cheap?
[0:51:10] m1lkman10: What if that guy is just trying to plant that idea into some chatters head, and then it doesn't actually work and a random chatter is out $100

[0:51:40] brandwarr: You need a receipt to return it? How tf you getting the non-discounted price back without a receipt? LOL
[0:51:40] misfitstv1: it’s like moving your diet to purely sweetcorn and just infinitely recycling your food….
[0:51:44] jarmotron: can I return this cucumber that i forgot about in my fridge for a couple months that pretty much liquified now?
[0:51:50] goombacci: @miniath_ x
[0:51:53] TimmayHS: @BigTrout3 yep, I'll always hide dog food at the bottom of the walmart cart and forget to pay for it
[0:51:54] kriegborne: *laughs in ADHD tax*

[0:52:37] biglonelytv: talking to cute girls
[0:52:37] wuffwuff112: asking wife for you knw
[0:52:37] Mazmerized: id rather go homeless than ask for moeny
[0:52:38] Lilurrn: the most uncomfortable thing
[0:52:38] murloc_oracle: depends on the friends
[0:52:39] Squats3: i have around $2k of "idgaf" money every month and always end up barely making it because im bad with money
[0:52:41] hotdogmartyr: pooping with the door open
[0:52:41] shadowreath93: im 30, did 8 years in the army and going to college ive had to ask my dad for money life just gets complicated sometimes often outta your hands
[0:52:41] Chappypappy1: Straight up
[0:52:41] cornygerman: asking them for a kidney
[0:52:42] Archmage_Michael: getting asked is worse
[0:52:43] TheLuo: Feel like everyone hits that point once in their early 20s
[0:52:44] Chuckszz: I hate asking for money, feels super weird for me
[0:52:45] TimmayHS: If they're rich and I'm poor, I don't feel bad about it.
[0:52:45] alarkin: there are many more things that are vastly more uncomfortable lol
[0:52:49] kelly_mac06: dude my sister in law asked her dad for money constantly, she has no shame
[0:52:50] itsmiraix: !drops

[0:52:58] enigmasvea: @goombacci classic
[0:52:59] Therealbrokensword: In Australia we used to be able to return console games within 7 days to this place EB games, I did it 50 times one year
[0:53:03] naro1089: did they ask or did you just give?
[0:53:04] litixio: cause you have the funds for that
[0:53:04] Mazkon: but did they ASK you ?
[0:53:05] OG_Kawngi: they prob didnt ask for it tho
[0:53:05] Basic_3: Yeah, but you're the 1%
[0:53:08] fzybny: Someone asking you for money and rejecting them is much  more uncomfortable.
[0:53:09] Squats3: no parent should feel bad asking a kid for money. you raised them
[0:53:11] cornygerman: Asking someone for a kidney is def worse
[0:53:14] Pst_Simon: Giving and asking is different
[0:53:15] Selad0r: giving > loaning money
[0:53:16] Pyrrha_GG: gift is different than NEEDING it
[0:53:17] litixio: but if they were struggling and HAD to ask you
[0:53:19] DatRippelEffect: some of my fellow marathon runners ask for charity money for certain races. could never do that
[0:53:20] the__Benji: Thats how they felt when you asked most likely
[0:53:22] BigTrout3: it was weird when my dad asked me for money at least to me
[0:53:23] brandwarr: Intent behind asking for money I think plays a huge part of it.
[0:53:25] misran: i feel like most kids who have the means and aren't a shitty person are happy to give their parents money
[0:53:26] OG_Kawngi: oh ok
[0:53:27] smolderdaddyuwu: they had you w/o your permission...
[0:53:33] shogunmaster2: you are also wealthy
[0:53:34] Archmage_Michael: I do the same. renovated their house last year
[0:53:40] jden74: fair
[0:53:42] itsCelivan: It depends on the person. Some people hold the provider mindset and don't like imposing on the person they "provide" for in a sense
[0:53:42] Chappypappy1: oh no hes going to the infinity loop stim bridge
[0:53:43] DowalThegin: I would love to be able to give money to my parents
[0:53:45] Basic_3: @Squats3 I'm very glad for the happy childhood and good relationship with your parents that you had.
[0:53:48] TimmayHS: you don't have any homies that you've hooked up after hitting it rich?
[0:53:48] danksly: yo cheers for gettin me through that whole fillin my keks period have a deck
[0:53:51] dapps231: trust me when my kids asked me fore money i had no problem with it. but when me and my wife split and i needed to get gas in my car.. i asked my daughter for $20 to help get me to work and that was the worst ive ever felt as a man.
[0:53:54] Jjmn12: new deck is also a bit different than rent
[0:53:55] danksly: SeemsGood
[0:53:57] Kamehameshaw: to you maybe, as a parent I am sure its uncomfortable. But i dont know your family dynamic, im just a parasocial weirdo on the internet
[0:53:57] casca322: woah
[0:53:58] deadhead922: So d4 still mid?
[0:54:01] Slapsstick: it all comes down to family and personal dynamics, my parents wouldnt ask me but I would give to them without question
[0:54:01] leubinator: yo bro got any of them spare kidneys
[0:54:03] the__Benji: But only if you're trying to sell it and dont need it
[0:54:05] Jack_the_Dipper: as a child maybe not but as a parent maybe iit can feel weird forr them @Maximum
[0:54:07] Chappypappy1: STIM BRIDGE
[0:54:07] ufwcode: "yo bro lowkey i need your left kidney"

[0:54:11] jarmotron: i was born with one kidney, and i'm sad i can't sell one whenever i'm in a bind
[0:54:12] Mazkon: i mean you got a spare one, just give me the kiodney dude. It's not that big of a deal

[0:54:18] naro1089: 90 day return policy typicallyt
[0:54:18] brandwarr: Bout it
[0:54:19] alarkin: coming out to a parent is 1000% worse (even when it goes well) but that's also being very real
[0:54:19] Joneim: Normal function mostly
[0:54:22] Hugejorma: Friend or kidney?
[0:54:23] Zemolz: you ask someone for a new one
[0:54:23] T4p5y: it honors you, that you do that, but imagine parents whom are poor and have to ask their kids - maybe that the meaning of the OG comment that its embarrising for oarents
[0:54:24] ciphkin_tv: you ilvl goes down
[0:54:24] gouldinglol: when they're done with it, they give it back
[0:54:25] biglonelytv: -1 kidney usually
[0:54:26] Vxfboy: I would rather ask someone for a kidney than for money tbh
[0:54:27] the__Benji: Yep, dead
[0:54:28] wommy: id never ask anyone id jsut let myself die i think
[0:54:28] eatclentrenh: prolly cant drink anymore
[0:54:29] oqqiH: My friend was born with 3, actually the god seed rng, spawned with free money
[0:54:30] elysona: Is it considered okay to ask for money in return for your kidney tho
[0:54:30] Madgeneto: @ciphkin_tv KEKW

[0:54:46] biglonelytv: KEKW
[0:54:47] kelly_mac06: it's fine
[0:54:48] Basic_3: Drinking is liver. You're more prone to certain other conditions like anemia I think?
[0:54:49] misran: drinking is liver not kidneys xdd
[0:54:50] Kamehameshaw: dont you have to be on a medication after losing a kidney?
[0:54:50] 1rowdy8: @Maximum my dad donated his kidney to me
[0:54:52] Pyrrha_GG: you dont uptake pain meds as fast
[0:54:52] bolibombi: 50% less duration on kidney shot on you
[0:54:53] Faraday5001: harder to make piss
[0:54:54] the__Benji: You need to drink more monster
[0:54:54] naro1089: youre fine with just one kidney, the weird thing is that theyll leave the '"bad" kidney in the person receiving another kidney, so they have 3
[0:54:54] cslg008: Cant drink alcohol
[0:54:54] dubbyatt: i mean thats a pretty big nerf
[0:54:54] goombacci: you are immune to kidney shot
[0:54:54] kouzis: my grandpa gave 1 to my dad and i can tell you nothing changes
[0:54:55] isittopee: you cant be salty anymore
[0:54:55] 1rowdy8: he has no restrictions
[0:54:56] st0nicks: dieteri restrictions
[0:54:56] Toointro: kidneys can regenerate
[0:54:58] kelly_mac06: YOU CAN LIVE FINE WITH ONE KIDNEY BRO
[0:54:58] leubinator: its like living with 2 kidneys but with one
[0:55:00] biglonelytv: USUALLY YOU LOSE ONE KIDNEY
[0:55:00] Mazmerized: can you not cc as rogue if you only have 1 kidney?
[0:55:01] danksly: a part of you is in another guy
[0:55:03] allornothing: Now you can only 49 parse in the kindey section
[0:55:03] jden74: 50% nerf to kidney functionality OMEGALUL
[0:55:03] pent217: You can live with 1 kidney, not zero
[0:55:03] brandwarr: You lose your backup kidney in case your main kidney shuts down.
[0:55:04] kb0tatr0n: kidneys are medications, liver is booze
[0:55:04] panta_xdd: you can live fine with like 1/4 of one kidney so, not much change
[0:55:07] spivet: arent you related to doctors I bet they know
[0:55:07] Vxfboy: You become yellow
[0:55:07] Gibsomething: you lose item level
[0:55:10] valafur359: you can go e 70% of your kidney and it heals back

[0:55:10] donoflakor: The other kidney gets bigger
[0:55:11] Grimwel87: you can live with 1 kidney
[0:55:11] Toointro: kidneys regenerate
[0:55:12] Balcones: the person you give it to gets a 3rd
[0:55:13] jarmotron: i only have 1 kidney, and there is no difference.  my 1 kidney just pumps
[0:55:14] JustJoshin____: it limits some of the medications you can take
[0:55:14] Rakaas: no back up kidney if it gets fucked up

[0:55:15] Madgeneto: google it
[0:55:15] Brewmaster_Holsten: You can donate your kidney, but you need to make sure that Ankh is up
[0:55:15] misfitstv1: giving away a kidney is difficult but at the end of the day… it’s night…
[0:55:15] SnowenneZ: People lead healthy lives with one kidney. After kidney donation, your remaining kidney will increase in size and take over the whole job of filtering your blood. Health outcomes for living donors are excellent and 99 percent of donors say they would recommend living kidney donation.
[0:55:16] 1rowdy8: Yes I have 3
[0:55:16] XaelXXI: I have 4
[0:55:18] Javiz: poggers
[0:55:18] Rolanor: There's usually a donation chain, you don't directly give to your person because you're rarely compatible. Instead you give to person B, and in exchange someone else's kidney match goes to your person
[0:55:18] skydollnoa: u cant give away anymore kidney its pretty much it @maximum
[0:55:18] reggiepowa: no he has 1
[0:55:19] pent217: Basically yeah

[0:55:21] pent217: It's a spare
[0:55:21] biggeek2: more vulnerable to injury, reduce salt intake  ad don't drink much.
[0:55:23] Dengara: I was having a bad day and chats kidney jokes helped.. thanks chat
[0:55:23] Madgeneto: lmao
[0:55:25] goombacci: @kb0tatr0n no; it depends on the medication
[0:55:27] Dennis410: Someone people are born with just 1 kidney..
[0:55:28] Vaiilz: Stfu idiots xD
[0:55:29] litixio: less weight
[0:55:30] OG_Kawngi: collector's edition kidney

[0:55:30] Hred5: what if the one u keep fails lmfao
[0:55:31] kelly_mac06: yea you should go sell one
[0:55:31] Grimwel87: @maximum It’s a backup system.
[0:55:31] 1rowdy8: 100% dialysis sucks
[0:55:32] brandwarr: Unless you need a new kidney then you're out of luck.
[0:55:32] biglonelytv: its like a spare tire
[0:55:32] Vegard10101: @Maximum you can live normally with 1 kidney, u can die on the operation table
[0:55:33] SolarPlayingGames: i have 3 kidneys and 4 balls
[0:55:33] cornygerman: +1 kidney
[0:55:34] valafur359: yea you can give 70% and it grows back
[0:55:34] BobPlaysTheGames: It's a back up, so you are more prone to getting health complications yourself in the future
[0:55:38] biglonelytv: YEAH FUCK KIDNEYS
[0:55:38] Aggroxcraig: fuck kidneys lolol
[0:55:38] Kamehameshaw: DO NOT DO THAT TO KIDNEYS
[0:55:39] kelly_mac06: when the twitch money runs out sell a kidney bro
[0:55:40] rsheridan89: i was born with only 1, only issue was no contact sports
[0:55:40] jarmotron: but if something happens to your kidney, then you're just fucked
[0:55:40] pent217: But then you no longer have an extra one
[0:55:42] kb0tatr0n: just get your spleen removed for less weight
[0:55:42] professor_cullman: it's like if Blizzard said to a shaman, you're getting a 50% kidney buff
[0:55:43] seabasstwitch: I AM YOUR KIDNEY TAKE THAT BACK
[0:55:43] MrChaCho: Nah, I'd still be fat
[0:55:44] TheGearman: Can I have one?
[0:55:44] Madgeneto: you are not balanced tho
[0:55:45] souledk: you have to take care of the one you have better. you have to take meds for a while after donation.
[0:55:45] TheNereverine: nah, theres must be a nerf to your system
[0:55:46] panta_xdd: @Solar_TwitchTV firstGarf
[0:55:46] snowfrog_: lighter means less gains if you do callisthenics
[0:55:46] illisteve: the downside is no redundancy if you do need it though
[0:55:47] Wikedlyrics: valafur359 thats liver LUL
[0:55:48] Shadowsrith: just go to hollywood. they harvest bodyparts lol
[0:55:48] glitsmonk: but if the last one you have goes bad then youre really fucked
[0:55:48] Slapsstick: severely nerfs your ability to withstand kidney problems for obvious reasons
[0:55:48] goombacci: and what if you do
[0:55:50] glowyhands1: giving up a kidney makes you far far more susceptible to diseases because you have no fallback
[0:55:50] allornothing: Aint no way max is gonna IRL buff by removing a kidney
[0:55:51] Madgeneto: asymmetrical weight
[0:55:51] JustJoshin____: lol it’s much more efficient with two
[0:55:52] wet_noodle_fight: BUT 50% reduction on kidney shot duration
[0:55:52] naro1089: its like your appendix, useless
[0:55:53] brandwarr: Better to have and not need then need and not have.
[0:55:54] Grimwel87: If you do then you’re on dialysis
[0:55:54] Jjmn12: you don't need it till you need it garf
[0:55:55] DanKnee16: And if your second fails you’re fucked but that’s just a small downside

[0:55:55] wommy: gunkier blood
[0:55:56] Hugejorma: I need it :)
[0:55:58] i_cassius: 2 is always better than one
[0:55:59] Its_Just_Pete: if the one you have goes bad then youre fooked
[0:56:00] JarRulez: what if you need a kidney after you give up a kidney
[0:56:00] Aggroxcraig: Get rid of a kidney and have kids. Back up plans.
[0:56:00] the__Benji: 50% chance to resist Kidney Shot
[0:56:02] Grimwel87: which sucks
[0:56:02] larkhill: if i could sell it...maybe
[0:56:02] Rusulake: better with 2 I say
[0:56:02] Seismos: Think ill keep my blood filters thanks
[0:56:04] Grimwel87: alot
[0:56:04] Gibsomething: I want someone to donate their kidney to me even though I have 2 healthy kidneys (im kidney maxing)
[0:56:05] danksly: you gotta ask them to centralise the one u keep or u walk in circles
[0:56:08] cornygerman: "Doctor i have 10 kidneys with me , can you insert them into me ? !
[0:56:08] LothorTV: Quick way to loose 100grams
[0:56:09] Reydien: one of the main things, your doctor will tell you not to play contact sports in case you get kidney punched
[0:56:09] honeychonker: I mean you dont really need two eyes or two ears either
[0:56:09] casca322: Is there a doctor in the house?
[0:56:11] J_a_m_e_s_bond: I mean maybe? Think of it like a computer core. You can use all 9 cores in your i9, but most of life requires like 5.
[0:56:11] litixio: What if the other one goes flat and you neeed the spare? @Maximum
[0:56:12] CrackedOrb: I mean, why do you need two hands?
[0:56:12] Sover31gn: With one kidney if you get kidney shot you die instead of being stunned
[0:56:14] glitsmonk: imagine you give one away but then have to ask for it back
[0:56:16] goombacci: def a rogue nerf
[0:56:24] Bakhadi: if you give away one kidney you get double duration debuff for when a rogue kidney shots you
[0:56:24] OG_Kawngi: is there a return period on kidneys
[0:56:27] biglonelytv: TRUE
[0:56:28] Slapsstick: @honeychonker i would argue you do for eyes, no depth perception otherwise
[0:56:29] 1rowdy8: Whenever I get an MRI it says my two original ones are shriveled up @Maximum
[0:56:32] goombacci: you do need two eyes for depth perception
[0:56:34] Vaiilz: Rogues aint got nuthin on ppl with no kidney lets fucking fo!
[0:56:35] isittopee: or two testicles
[0:56:37] Dengara: Well.. 2 ears helps with locating where sounds are coming from, but yeah
[0:56:37] reggiepowa: YEP
[0:56:38] Suited_Monkey: I have kidney cancer, can we not

[1:05:16] kingpeace09: hate gearing lazy ppl in raid who dont run m+
[1:05:17] ZYLOSGAMES: Tier tho
[1:05:20] Kahllol: Those guys hard spamming keys should just get prio on the hot ticket items tbh
[1:05:25] father_tito: That would imply that the guild used that logic behind their decision making and not just favortism lol
[1:05:30] BigTrout3: yeah... but the data is making them look Susie

[1:06:01] danksly: he's flexin on the tanks
[1:06:13] s0xas: didn't get a single pips when 4 of them dropped because they went to the players that only played twice a week when we raided
[1:06:13] Reydien: do you give that extra-geared person priority on the chase items like trinkets?  or is that "not fair" to the others?
[1:06:18] bobsxo: time to do M+ after raiod

[1:12:25] w0nka: My guild back in the day had a trial along with us in Karazhan. It was the only time we ever saw Midnight drop. We allowed them to roll since they were there with us and it seemed like the fair thing to do. They won the mount and left the guild the. next. day.

[1:12:36] Therealbrokensword: @Maximum in Diewnuts credit he his putting up top 1k heroic parses and better mythic parses compared to Bumps, so technically "anywhere else I would pump" is true because Diewnuts is a demon
[1:12:37] Neefie: Just make a good community and people want to stay lol
[1:12:37] Basic_3: Except also, guild jumping is the best way to gain ranks.

[1:12:58] awesomeoohh: My goal is CE and I feel like guild hopping to progressively better guilds is the way to do it
[1:13:01] JLMerrickk: @goombacci no lol
[1:13:06] amperegames: handling it completely like an adult is slamming /gquit the second the vibes are off
[1:13:08] brosciencegym: Grom needs that meatyvation

[1:13:58] Mani1301: @Rugburn__ name checks out
[1:14:01] glitsmonk: if you told a guild that your goal was to raid in liquid one day you would become a guild meme
[1:14:02] Darkshore_Capital: 100% yes
[1:14:04] ismoot: yes
[1:14:04] sulozor: yes and give them loot
[1:14:05] TheLuo: 100% yes
[1:14:05] Its_Just_Pete: sure
[1:14:05] Darkshore_Capital: shows they're an adult
[1:14:07] mikemikebikebike: @Maximum What do you feel about season 4 not being a new raid? and that the next race to world first is going to be some time in september ish
[1:14:08] goombacci: yes
[1:14:09] alarkin: Yes - I much prefer up front
[1:14:13] hfcooky: 100% yes
[1:14:13] Pyrrha_GG: Also with how sever identity is dead, there are just no consequences to just leaving a guild
[1:14:13] niddociv: Yeah, could also help others get better
[1:14:14] chefbubbles24: My raid guild spilt after Aberrus. Not sure on why but one group got AOTC before Christmas and the other group got it a week ago due to PUGs carrying.
[1:14:14] biggeek2: yup, definitely recruit that one.
[1:14:15] Neefie: It sounds like an entirely reasonable recruit yes
[1:14:17] frauditssb: If they were good yeah
[1:14:17] Jesdawow: no
[1:14:17] amperegames: if they can be normal
[1:14:18] Maydayfury: Isn't that what comprises liquid they just dont say the quiet part out loud?
[1:14:18] Jjmn12: if they aren't gonna leave mid tier its fine
[1:14:18] othernewname: no they would probably be toxic cause they basically think we suck
[1:14:24] Rusulake: IF it stays the whole raid season yeah
[1:14:24] oopsydoo: all depends what kind of guild you have and your guild goals
[1:14:26] kriegborne: I'd respect that
[1:14:27] narthy_poo: Depends on the skill level but sure
[1:14:28] brunbanan: naowh??

[1:14:29] Nekz3: adult don't play video games
[1:14:32] killswitch941: i would it shows they have drive to be the best
[1:14:35] ItsmeRinca: if they don’t leave mid tier it’s all gucci
[1:14:38] richisawesome: it doesnt necessarily mean theyre older. maybe theyve just seen some shit in their older guilds
[1:14:39] itsCelivan: Sure. As long as they help clear the tier and don't ninja then I don't see a problem
[1:14:39] Xibate: aslong as they pull their weight i dont mind
[1:14:41] miniath_: depends on our desperation lol
[1:14:44] iMeista: with the way recruiting is for sure, safety for the current tier vs safety for the future
[1:14:45] chefbubbles24: I'm not the best and I know it so its fine
[1:14:55] RequisiteOfED: If someone thinks their raiders will stay with them forever and aren't like 3/X heroic guilds are usually pretty weird
[1:14:55] stelfbronco: I would because they would play a lot and help the raid alot
[1:14:58] Darkshore_Capital: Yeah, you don't leave mid-tier, thats just mean
[1:15:00] Faraday5001: if they stick out the tier, who cares
[1:15:00] Asuo_: @Maximum I mean that's like saying someone who in a job interview says they want to be in a fortune 500 company. Sure I'll take you but I also know the stars have to align for you to get that goal anyway
[1:15:00] zzzDai: This is a first, chat is showing up on stream before twitch chat

[1:15:27] risettefreya: I personally have to be thankful to my guild, cause I have schizophrenia and I have a hard time

[1:15:53] bobsxo: we had 3 people leave to strawberry puppy kisses during mythic SLG prog in CN. We dont talk to any of them any more after they stopped raiding hall of fame.
[1:15:55] themadbunny275: cult

[1:16:57] SCMSV: Chatting was best player
[1:16:57] itsCelivan: yeah, but how did you hop to the guilds. did you just dip or stick around for the tiers?
[1:16:59] Ruinx81: A bunch of of my guild left and faction changed to alliance Oce for mythic prog but we still run keys and heroic with them it works for everybody

[1:18:28] Hardex: ive dipped but i was too young to understand that was bad
[1:18:40] iMeista: trying to climb guild ranks as a tank is annoying now, no one needs a tank
[1:18:51] Jazzarus_: I did that but from heroic to mythic, the other guild was never going to do mythic and I wanted to

[1:49:30] asthelegendgoes: @noxiouzx i hwvent seen em this week but i follow someone who streams spriest +25 kwys and they do like 150k dps...ill have to pay attention in their next stream
[1:49:38] symbolicben: @stelfbronco no problem honestly its best to learn dungeons and mobs knowing which have frontals so u know where u can stand without getting slammed by them it takes a bit to get used too
[1:49:48] symbolicben: but once u figure them out u will be blasting
[1:50:01] Squats3: why is the wowhead news feed so fucking bad. the patch changed some things with frost DKs interaction with the legendary and i cant find the article anymore

[1:58:11] fragileplasma: its not just sac tho its bop too and lay
[1:58:11] valk113: fair point
[1:58:18] Dracomann: i feel like i see like 5 times as many ret palas now than i have had in the past 5 seasons, i don't know if atleast this season it's because of the leggo
[1:58:18] TsingaTheGremlin: @Ronfendo I feel like its that and theyre also sorta popular fantasy people in general
[1:58:18] WeldyyDT: what class do you think needs a rework the most
[1:58:19] CrackedOrb: maybe with all these rets playing now they will fix the spellwarding not working bug
[1:58:22] Orange_SM: sac with boomie is pretty pog
[1:58:23] SebastianMelmoth1854: people who don't play with a paladin really underestimate how much dr sac actually gives
[1:58:33] polygoncoke: 5 minute darkness??
[1:58:35] Elhi0s: whatever all this the fact that vdh is so strong rn doesnt help havoc case
[1:58:38] twinkieruler95: @Maximum who are you routing for this weekend in the football games?
[1:58:39] GooseComics: @WeldyyDT Spriest. it hasn't had one in a patch. They are WAY over due
[1:58:39] splashz0r: they need a brez
[1:58:40] Elhi0s: for high end
[1:58:43] thecajuncommie: Hand of Sac, Lay on Hands...REt has hands, dont mess with us
[1:58:43] Dreadlol: hella utility
[1:58:45] NQZTR: you kinda won't gamble a 30% chance to dodge dmg
[1:58:49] miniath_: the barrier to the highest keys is your squishiest player dying, sac counters that
[1:58:56] JamaBear: tell them you identify as a dragon @Maximum
[1:58:58] finalhardcore: thy
[1:58:59] CrackedOrb: 1m sac is sick tbh
[1:59:01] zzzDai: ret also brings brez
[1:59:04] xxoutkastedxx: bracers pretty trash though
[1:59:06] oresties: ret brezes sooo
[1:59:11] Cakerinotv: sac got nerfed and still is insane
[1:59:11] squirebdd: Can the bracers be used in cb?
[1:59:11] thoromyr19: the rng on battle rez bracers is so cringe
[1:59:14] healapotamus: probably want a spriest
[1:59:20] jermackz: where are the demo locks at BibleThump
[1:59:21] WeldyyDT: @GooseComics I wouldn't argue it but personally as a whole class I think warrior needs it
[1:59:29] SebastianMelmoth1854: if you're dying because of the sac chances are reallllly good that whoever you sac'd otherwise would've died
[1:59:33] miniath_: rogue is so unkillable its disgusting
[1:59:39] MutouHimself: fury warrior is up there
[1:59:41] bigkris69_420: why is hunter not meta ? Are they too squish??
[1:59:41] 3V3R357: forgetting fury, fury lives 30s without any externals
[1:59:45] yungbobo357: What addon shows all of that additional information in the group finder? <3
[1:59:46] Standy94: Outlaw kinda sadge cause cd is on global and costs energy
[1:59:46] Elhi0s: bro mage is untouchable and rogue we not talk about it
[1:59:48] kallisz: mw is also giga unkillable
[1:59:49] ayunexz: rogue has no cheat death tho
[1:59:54] GooseComics: @WeldyyDT my answer was a meme btw lol. spriest gets reworked almost every expansion. but really, yes warrior needs to get something

[2:00:15] drtnzz_: warlock ?
[2:00:18] midiansgod: I see Nerf is tanking a key right now without Ellesmere oh boy
[2:00:21] Standy94: At least on Outlaw you lose some damage to press a defensive
[2:00:25] Squats3: @Maximum frosts spells are applying the lego debuff now. probably the way to go honestly.. unholy just kinda cant do that.
[2:00:26] beefy_cheez: elusiveness is so much more value
[2:00:28] asthelegendgoes: @goosecomics they reworked it to be great and now its useless again hahaha
[2:00:34] Voyburke: What makes warlocks tanky these days?
[2:00:39] Vaiilz: @GooseComics Warr needs to get everything at this point, not just something, its actually a disgrace what they are doing to that class
[2:00:45] RSTight: Cheat is bait unless you are bad. Elusiveness is giga
[2:00:46] Elhi0s: @Standy94 u also just lose some by just existing with target cap lol
[2:00:48] NotD4k: @Voyburke being locks
[2:00:53] Nenemene: sup bro whats your plan for s4?

[2:01:06] Kaiem: 72 hour stream Pog
[2:01:06] splashz0r: it's also a really bad week push week
[2:01:06] zzzDai: Ret + shadow stonks up havoc stonks down
[2:01:08] Lenzoface: im taking it d4 didnt feel that good considering neither u or shorud is playing it today? @Maximum
[2:01:08] Standy94: @elhi0s target cap isn’t a huge issue in pugs
[2:01:08] CrackedOrb: ret stealing your lunch
[2:01:14] GooseComics: its not ret.
[2:01:14] Basic_3: @Voyburke Having a reasonable defensive on a 45s CD means they have coverage of a lot of dangerous events
[2:01:14] noewon: HAH lil bro is not playing ret
[2:01:16] Ronfendo: dont play a fotm spec,
[2:01:16] BlazinHurricane: 24 hour stream time KEKW

[2:01:29] RSTight: People realizing you need more 1 shot defensives
[2:01:32] xrader858: brother
[2:01:32] Datguyjay: havoc is fine, people just picking up ret because it's hype
[2:01:33] tempehst11: anyone have a link too his dragon riding wa?
[2:01:39] SebastianMelmoth1854: no shot ret is better than havoc, and i main ret
[2:01:39] AoPsyke: you went into raid
[2:01:42] miniath_: @Voyburke same things that have always been, short cd pact, high base stamina, improved healthstone
[2:01:44] santalylth: why we looking at echo
[2:01:50] Standy94: Ret is also an affix doer
[2:01:54] Maxtavius: it doesn't matter what you believe, it matters what the people believe - signed a fury warrior
[2:02:07] richie3000: wake of ashes is busted right now. nerf inc
[2:02:09] Darklott: I mean havoc might be the only class that changes literally 1 talent point to go from full aoe to full st you just cant beat that in m+
[2:02:12] SebastianMelmoth1854: ret feels more fun for me but it's not as cracked as havoc, no shot
[2:02:15] erdls: incorperal can suck my nuts
[2:02:27] BlazinHurricane: Bear tank Pog
[2:02:42] Yagr6: "down to the 29s" LUL

[2:03:09] Chappypappy1: you think warriors need some love? any ideas? @Maximum
[2:03:10] misran: the #1 timed key of the week really drives home the point that you don't need to follow meta
[2:03:15] HiConcert0: not a single warr to be seen
[2:03:18] mybootyisasnack: unholy is really fun but if your tank isnt on the same page as you it fucks your dps sm

[2:36:21] TBouse: it was down to the milisecond
[2:36:22] breekicheeki9: LUL

[2:36:42] thecajuncommie: never even done this dungeon before, I have no idea whats happening
[2:36:53] XYRRAAH: Just go into the fast and don't do pro shit. All good no fails.

[2:37:57] thecajuncommie: I will tolerate no slander

[2:38:15] DeadlyForm: it was like a split second in the slow

[2:41:49] TheCJrose1234: why does 28 seem to be the hard max for pugs?
[2:41:51] SploogeShot: @thecajuncommie murozond is an anagram for nozdormu, that's the lore
[2:41:51] thecajuncommie: @stormranger47 for all time. always
[2:41:52] eolin89: double on 28 forti without lust is kinda copium
[2:41:58] Koodiijr: how is the key over??
[2:41:59] Karkesis: ***
[2:42:01] nite101: @OG_Kawngi Dont think so, the animation is a bit slow. The debuff runs out before it ticks i think
[2:42:04] Koodiijr: you have a ton of time
[2:42:06] smolderdaddyuwu: the scream is for frontals
[2:42:10] TBouse: it's doable you just need a very good healer
[2:42:16] Bovidae: you have 14 minutes
[2:42:17] lvdw1g: tons of time
[2:42:18] MilaPriest: haha
[2:42:18] ZACKandATTACK: I think you were in the fast, but the buff/debuff isn't instantly applied when you are visually in the zone. Has some lag going on
[2:42:18] Bovidae: what is the issue
[2:42:19] PepikStep: ggs @popzugzugz o7
[2:42:19] thecajuncommie: @SploogeShot no way! fucking really?
[2:42:21] lvdw1g: Kappa
[2:42:37] SploogeShot: @thecajuncommie no i made it up
[2:42:38] murloc_oracle: that wasnt on the healer lol @TBouse tank ate the swirly
[2:42:43] Arithawn: We're gonna be doing legion levels of dps in war within 🎉
[2:42:44] CoffeeASAP: did they give up?
[2:42:44] MilaPriest: same spot jdotb enraged haha
[2:43:00] TBouse: @murloc_oracle they were wiping even if the tank didnt do that
[2:43:15] thecajuncommie: @SploogeShot whew, Nozdormu is my favorite, because he is yellow. would hate to see him be a bad guy with a different name and color
[2:43:53] k0nflictuchiha: wtf xD
[2:43:56] Slapsstick: its like 1 frame off LUL
[2:43:58] MoleDude: game bad

[2:44:28] goombacci: we know why you fel rushed left it just so happens to be the reason you died
[2:44:29] Yagr6: send that to blizzard
[2:44:31] jondbr: that’s crazy
[2:44:37] PolishBunny: with low bit rates now on stream, you can see the pizza slash line even xD
[2:44:38] 0_____Kappa: but how did only the tank die to that?
[2:44:38] smolderdaddyuwu: 72 hours stream later..

[2:45:02] lord_of_beard: how does that mechanic work? are you supposed to be in the dark when it expires?

[2:45:16] thecajuncommie: stream is never ending, cant get io
[2:45:21] kadashy1: he has to stay in melee so he didn't have much leeway with avoiding it right?
[2:45:21] 0_____Kappa: TrollDespair
[2:45:24] misran: @lord_of_beard you want to be in fast when it goes off so it only ticks everyone once
[2:45:27] chasen218: @Maximum  hey max how are u .. new player here ... can u give me some tips how can i be good RL like u one day?
[2:45:29] NoBountiesGiven: the gut knew

[2:45:50] 0_____Kappa: @kadashy1 dh can double jump over those balls
[2:45:51] chatgpttwitchbot: anyone know how to see twitch drop progress cant see it anywhere
[2:45:53] thecajuncommie: roll a ret paladin so that you can get in a group, sorry your class is turbo ass now, ret is god
[2:45:53] TBouse: are you planning to end stream every time you get io

[2:55:16] justpeacealways: Anyone know if boomkins are good in m+?
[2:55:25] Dracomann: couldn't most groups gain 10k over all just from being better at not doin minor mistakes ?

[2:59:47] Yagr6: is incorp or sanguine the bigger issue?
[2:59:51] Boossterr: prot pala sweet it’s a deplete so max has to stick around longer, sanguine going to ruin his consecrate.
[2:59:53] twinkieruler95: @Maximum do you think all affixes should be kiss curse?
[2:59:54] zzzDai: I think every affix should have a positive and a negative
[2:59:55] Turbocat56: make hard affixes not unfun affixes
[3:00:13] Onyo1337: there are barely 27 and 28 keys on EU, people just skip this week... remove affixes

[3:00:52] cirque78: Every three minutes warrior can throw their weapon at corp
[3:00:55] CYRUS_DH: KEKW
[3:00:57] Dracomann: affixes feels like they were made to give enough varience for playing the same dungeons season after season. with the changing dungeons couldn't they just remove affixes at this point and just have pure scaling as they have already
[3:01:01] drtnzz_: warriors use 2 buttons dont make it harder for them KEKW

[3:49:36] Slapsstick: doesnt have an overall tab Sadge unless hes saving it for a surprise reveal at the end and i missed it
[3:49:40] chubbytheboi: @Flarofpern For classes that got released at the same time, shammy sure does get lot less love compared to paladins xD
[3:49:42] gnimis: rip enhancement in EB

[3:52:33] mangotangodown66: is it worth swapping deflecting dance for healing reduction this week?
[3:52:37] chubbytheboi: @osgaming57 so you mean utility? like what paladins provide as well? and look at the DPS diff lul

[3:52:56] Ryyzas: whats name of WEAKAURA FOR MASSSTUNS?

[3:54:33] lvdw1g: @lvdw1g Sounds to me like rets have the typical ret problems that made me leave that class many moons ago
[3:54:40] Zircons: sanguino popping off
[3:54:44] osgaming57: @chubbytheboi anymways how is shadow now?
[3:54:52] Therealbrokensword: That healer sanguine is a beast

[3:55:08] Powered_: Sanguine spec needs a nerf
[3:55:10] westsidewow: does sanguine ichor stream? their healing is insane
[3:55:15] chubbytheboi: @osgaming57 checked Dorki's stream earlier and they play with a shadow - seems to be pumping now
[3:55:15] ArcaneSyntax: @lvdw1g Ret is super fun, speaking as someone who didn't like ret before the rework
[3:55:31] Team_Spanky: @osgaming57 Better. But the tier still forces you into a very specific build. And that build isnt that fun
[3:55:46] Calysong: !wa
[3:55:50] Ahrmanhamma: Ret has always felt great since the rework. There's still some problems with the talent tree at its core, but the buffs are nice
[3:55:58] Ryyzas: whats name of WEAKAURA FOR MASSSTUNS?
[3:56:01] Ryyzas: !wa
[3:56:02] muse_less: acshuwally
[3:56:04] chubbytheboi: @Team_Spanky That's why I left my shadow for now, I don't wanna play around SWD
[3:56:07] Ahrmanhamma: Ret was also OK before the rework, but only OK
[3:56:10] osgaming57: @Team_Spanky season 2 was more fun or?
[3:56:30] chubbytheboi: @Ahrmanhamma It was clunky af and not fun to play imo
[3:56:30] Thugmountainz: key ded?
[3:56:35] Balouuu: meta pull and second intermiss
[3:56:36] ArcaneSyntax: I think ret needs a reshuffling of the talent tree with some targeted tuning, and they need to buff mastery, but it's not as dire as people make it out to be.
[3:56:38] Ltabes: this pull with sang is cursed now
[3:56:46] AxeOlotolz: inc insane sanguin healing
