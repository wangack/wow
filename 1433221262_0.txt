[0:35:12] KragnosWoW: but technically that wouldnt be "first" so idk
[0:35:44] KragnosWoW: they just need a tournament realm for all guilds to race on i guess

[0:36:33] KragnosWoW: yeah you can argue the last guild to fight the boss would have the least pulls because they saw everyone do it but when it comes to disputing the top 2 guilds i think its faire

[1:55:23] mavericks312: @Limsicle idk currently i think they have the damage i just think the problems are more mechanics then dmg
[1:55:27] Sollice: Your not going to split and reclear if you dont try double legos first

[1:56:35] Nanoguts: but at they same time they claim they dont want blizz having a hand in the WF, them doing nerfs has shown they have had a hand in it either way

[3:32:13] misomander: i ran jailer gauntlet it gives a lot of mats for alts if you need
[3:32:14] espasona1: lived in it for a day or 2 to make 291 leggos
[3:32:17] Kleva1: I quit playing for a long time and need to farm it bad for mats

[3:32:25] lolgiff: 1650 cinders for a 262
[3:32:26] s7wede: Torghast past layer 13 is for transmog and mounts only. If you want to create legendaries it's faster to spam 9's a few times
[3:32:27] CritcobainTV: 1700 ish soul cinders, which is what im short on
[3:32:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've got 55,000 cosmic flux from farming chests and doing rares

[3:33:24] Atolanos: @nodramajustpizza_ Not the belt but any other slot or to get a 291 yes
[3:33:32] mrpresbaby: the belt is free though
[3:33:37] nodramajustpizzaa: ahh ty @atolanos
[3:33:38] Atolanos: The belt is stuck at 265
[3:33:43] Cafe0le: the unity belt requires the quest on alts too, right?
[3:33:48] NippersWoW: @Mayhemunleashed Yes Yes Yes :)

[3:44:57] unifhyf: xD
[3:44:57] mrpresbaby: sweet
[3:45:04] s7wede: Some classes have their BiS on tier slots only so Blizzard should have given us the ability to craft legendaries on any slot like Unity.
[3:45:06] t0csik: next exp Infinite dragones
[3:45:06] PvtHudson093: if you have 4 tiers slots covered the 5th being a 291 leggo isnt a bad choice

[3:49:49] Majinshi: isnt that the last q of startign over?
[3:49:50] Deadcells: Legendaries and covenants makes this game very inaccessible to new players. My girlfriend tries to do keys and gets yelled at for her dps. She doesn’t have the correct covenant or leggo. New players would rather play something else then do this research

[4:18:04] balancedlight: @Towelliee Good Morning !!!!! I hope you are having a great day so far. I bet its nice knowing all your food will taste gormet again!!
[4:18:32] Jere4190: Yeah they make good pvm like you can't argue with that. I was just saying if they wanted added difficulty you'd randomize a bit. Maybe even just put it in the highest tier of raids or something
[4:18:33] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[4:18:34] kungen1975: This Raid is realy a fetiq/endurance race. 😀

[4:18:59] pereadin: @towelliee there’s a hidden phase with a soak
[4:19:11] pereadin: Liquid did their last 10 pulls off stream to hide their strat
[4:19:16] mrpresbaby: Is there a higher ilvl for final few bosses this raid again?
[4:19:17] dimofodi: I heard some casters yesterday talking about there being a buff to healing and damage but you also have increased damage coming in to I guess offset the healing increase.

[4:20:54] mrpresbaby: Do you think they get back to Jailer today?
[4:20:54] j_bar111: reclear is gunna be LUL
[4:21:06] Dudamnit: They posted am funny video on twitter, got some laughs off me
[4:21:16] zeitgeiz: 2 hours
[4:21:27] cbiskit89: Won’t they do splits and get double leggo today?
[4:21:28] capricore: Headed to the Y in 1.5 hours. Will they reclear before i finish my 3 mile run? LUL
[4:21:32] j_bar111: @Towelliee you have all your rep for double lego?
[4:21:43] cbiskit89: Maybe that won’t take long
[4:21:44] Zeke_nl: i really want both guilds to be pulling jailer the same time, would be most exciting but its not happening
[4:21:46] Holysal: i want the world to burn. i hope they clear fast and in the jailer today LUL
[4:21:54] MaMad666: lol
[4:22:03] capricore: SPLITS would be dumb. just do the questsline for double leggo and BURN IT ALL DOWN
[4:22:04] smoketrayne: They will wipe more to over pushing than anything

[4:22:19] d1stract10n: EU raging about the reset. and how limit doesn't deserve
[4:22:31] pereadin: Halondrus might give them problems if they dps too quickly and mess up the timings they’re used to @towelliee
[4:22:39] SiXKiNG_: cant lie, I hope Liquid absolutely slaps it as a fan, however, what a shit show that would be lmao
[4:22:48] balancedlight: nah id be satisfied lol lets see liquid win
[4:22:57] wildheittv: You don't think they do last minute Heroic splits today before going into Jailer prog?
[4:22:59] OnePlayerPete: Double lego isn't the unicorn ppl think it is
[4:23:00] capricore: I could see them delaying NA over bumping EU forward
[4:23:09] capricore: but i doubt they would do either
[4:23:10] Lexxania: #doubleleggodramatuesday
[4:23:10] Liverstad: the situation with double leggos after 2 weeks of progression and the tuning of this raid is unfortunate
[4:23:13] mrpresbaby: Echo fans are mad at their own guild because Gingi isn't on Jailer
[4:23:17] 91Niki: NA beta testers Kappa
[4:23:21] capricore: They can do it, they just won't
[4:23:28] mrpresbaby: so I hope Liquid slams Jailer hard today

[4:23:30] Archiduss: Haven't we been waiting for that shitstorm for years now? With a US Guild getting world first kill and the EU guild killing a few hours after. Which will ignite the WoW forums and maybe push Blizzard for a global release anyway?
[4:23:32] FrankTizzle: Max already said they don't think they're going to kill it until Thursday or so
[4:23:32] Mitteennss: i know alot of people will say liquid won (if they win) because of double leggos
[4:23:45] Holysal: They just being stubborn at this point
[4:23:53] FrankTizzle: at the earliest
[4:23:55] FrankTizzle: Yea
[4:24:15] d1stract10n: i realy want a Mythic only phase
[4:24:27] gali5656: according to the raid journal it looks like p2 and  p3 will be pretty crazy
[4:24:31] mrpresbaby: My prediction is the floor falls out and they fight him on a new platform
[4:24:35] 91Niki: Maybe that's gonna be a 10.0 thing? Merge accounts, so it's not separated by EU and NA. As well as make patch days the same day overall
[4:24:39] dalteredh: He said he thinks there probably is a mythic phase
[4:24:40] CardinalTX: How did they get so successful and then become so out of touch with their players?
[4:24:42] Zeke_nl: EU fans = cowboys fans
[4:24:53] mrpresbaby: @Zeke_nl I love this lol
[4:24:57] cyb3rduck365: eu fanboys direct anger at liquid rather than blizzard for the shit reset rules
[4:25:15] rocketruu: Think it could be a repeat mechanic where he dies at like 45/50%? Also if they do a global release then Alpha taking WF 100%
[4:25:16] GodKingMuninn: Don't discredit blood legion, kin, ascent, ruined those boys were some of the OG's and NOT eu
