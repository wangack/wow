[2:13:23] Masqerader: "Gearing was insanely fast this Season compared to the past, with week 1 average item levels approximately equal to week 4 of previous tiers for high-end guilds like Liquid. The goal was to create a system to unify separate systems from Mythic+, open world, PvP, while addressing the fact that there was no upgrade path for raiding, and while they achieved that goal, the rate that high-end players "finished" gearing was measured in the first 2-3 weeks, which felt too fast."

[2:19:57] Masqerader: "phone booth" boss
[2:20:00] Masqerader: as they called it
[2:20:26] essadis: holy shit Armored Core comes out this August also...
[2:21:09] Masqerader: "Bosses were much shorter this tier, particularly Sarkareth as the end boss at ~7.5 minutes. This was inspired by Blackhand (which was in turn inspired by Siegecrafter Blackfuse), as a fight which felt like it "hit the gas and didn't let up until it ended" and they wanted to try to recreate that feeling of heavy execution for a short amount of time. They do think that they want a little bit more attrition on end of boss encounters
[2:21:35] Mallaes: Yes
[2:21:41] Masqerader: correct
[2:22:01] Mallaes: Crafted 447 > upgraded to 441

[2:23:14] Reckless_Monk: Just do lfr fir shadow flame spark
[2:23:38] Molvonos: I love having Heroic Ashkandur as Transmog on my Evoker.
[2:23:44] Mallaes: He need crests, not sparks
[2:23:59] Mallaes: Time to farm 16s :P
