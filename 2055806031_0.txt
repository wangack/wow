[0:13:16] SirBarracuda: Good afternoon
[0:13:26] COOP3R: Happy wednesday
[0:13:45] SskygamesS: So secret patch not secret only on march LUL
[0:13:59] Larkaro: Gratz on selling out
[0:14:05] ellenara35: mrgmJAM
[0:14:06] Haestoh: What happened to only selling 50 by end of the day?
[0:14:28] SskygamesS: EZ
[0:14:33] CloudyHS: sorry mrgm i have a confession, i bought all the tickets, no one is coming
[0:14:33] physalis4: Remember when you were worried no one would show up?
[0:14:39] COOP3R: How many peolpe can the venue hold?
[0:14:39] ellenara35: bigger venue needed next time then lol
[0:14:40] NeeK_23: remember thinking you'd be the only one there and we told you it was gonna pop off big
[0:14:46] databob1: mabye your more popular than you think
[0:15:00] Kozzna: I can't wait for this!! My first wow event üòÉ
[0:15:04] Domahkin: Is there a cap to the venues capacity? Can there be future rounds of tickets?
[0:15:04] MachoCham: Can we get Red Bull to build an extension?
[0:15:12] physalis4: I saw a few ppl from the US are heading over.
[0:15:45] Haestoh: Fuck it lets break Fire Regulations!
[0:15:50] databob1: ok be humble doesn't mean it's not true
[0:15:52] COOP3R: how come you went with free tickets?
[0:16:27] MachoCham: Our hotels
[0:16:30] MachoCham: And food
[0:16:32] MachoCham: I mean err
[0:16:51] Big_Rum: Maybe do a VIP Ticket?
[0:16:59] athrem01: Good afternoon :D
[0:17:13] Haestoh: Cham needs hotel rooms for his 40 kids
[0:17:20] COOP3R: admirable
[0:17:25] Big_Rum: i talked with Rage and she said she is coming
[0:17:44] SlithTheSivak: your the fulcrum of the event though
[0:17:49] SirBarracuda: Set up a facility for voluntary contributions perhaps, we'll throw a few quid in to help with overheads
[0:17:56] NeeK_23: can we have a ball pit still?
[0:18:06] MediumRareOG: You don't have to pocket the money. You can spend it on the event. You're organizing it though. You should value your time and make something IMHO. Either way, nobody would've blinked at paying 10 or 20 pounds
[0:18:36] MachoCham: I would at the tickets I have KEKW
[0:18:46] databob1: @mrgm it's not about you but it's still your event
[0:18:58] Larkaro: maybe do the next batch of tickets as paid, the first batch was an early bird special
[0:19:23] MachoCham: The issue we have with other venues are the overheads
[0:19:33] Haestoh: We‚Äôre taking cash payments at the door, Dan already avoids the tax man anyway.
[0:19:34] MediumRareOG: Just put it in context of how much people spend on a single Starbucks order
[0:19:54] MachoCham: Lets face it, this is a good problem to have
[0:20:13] Big_Rum: Is Blizz gonna help?
[0:20:18] BBMezzy: mrgmHehe
[0:20:22] COOP3R: burn the ships
[0:20:31] Kozzna: I can't wait for it! So no pressure ü§™
[0:20:39] Haestoh: TBC‚Ä¶
[0:20:48] MachoCham: All I will say is we have to hold some tickets back for VIP
[0:20:50] MediumRareOG: You mean Microsoft? LULW
[0:21:00] WhyDaRumGone: You sound less British on stream than on YT
[0:21:01] ratgefingah: hello hello

[0:22:33] MachoCham: WELL DONE
[0:22:34] MachoCham: GJ

[0:22:45] NeeK_23: same for me. no luck today
[0:22:46] physalis4: you didn‚Äôt need it anyway
[0:22:56] ratgefingah: I heard you were gonna level a rogu today? Kappa
[0:23:17] MachoCham: @imjoeski is smashing shit out the park
[0:23:25] NeeK_23: on the brightside, its not tyrannical this week
[0:23:47] Haestoh: @machocham am I? BibleThump

[0:24:15] CerebrillUK: hello!

[0:24:23] MissBirchBee: HeyGuys
[0:24:24] bysho: hi üòÄ
[0:24:25] delynia: hi
[0:24:34] shaypressplay: Howdy all
[0:24:36] Kozzna: Kozzna subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:25:10] SskygamesS: pepeLaugh
[0:25:17] dustinrichie: I'm here, just me, not a legend  :D  Saw link from Twitter that you're doing Ravenholdt.  It reminds me of an old D&D campaign, and I always wanted to see more content there!
[0:25:22] Kozzna: I'm at work, so can't be much longer. But can't wait for your event and I've been a lurking for a while xD
[0:25:26] NeeK_23: pickpocket stream mrgmPOG
[0:25:28] Xesol: you can buy them in general, not cheap though
[0:25:44] ratgefingah: xdawboost?
[0:25:44] SskygamesS: glad  i have rogue lvl 70 KEKW
[0:25:48] ratgefingah: oh
[0:25:50] Forgiven78: YES!
[0:25:53] Bware2: blasphemy
[0:25:54] Xesol: this is how it begins lol
[0:25:57] Big_Rum: What!
[0:25:57] Haestoh: LIES
[0:26:00] Big_Rum: who are you?
[0:26:00] physalis4: lol you‚Äôre playing a rogue
[0:26:05] Forgiven78: Here's the BIG question, what class?
[0:26:09] Forgiven78: Err Race
[0:26:10] NeeK_23: saving for that earthen hunter
[0:26:15] SskygamesS: how you are on love achievements so far?
[0:26:18] Forgiven78: Dark Iron?
[0:26:20] NeeK_23: vulpera?
[0:26:29] Sindragozer: vulpera was my guess too
[0:26:30] Bware2: undead undead undead
[0:26:33] ratgefingah: feels like the rogue could come in handy more,maybe there are more farms or cheeses necessary @MrGM
[0:26:34] ellenara35: worgen?
[0:26:36] Bware2: damn
[0:26:38] Haestoh: It's a gnome isn't it
[0:26:47] Forgiven78: I went Void Elf, dark skin, Red eyes and white hair named Snitch
[0:26:48] SskygamesS: night elf?
[0:26:49] jurassic28: mechagnome NotLikeThis
[0:26:50] DevoidX: got to be a gnome...
[0:26:54] CloudyHS: @MrGM i think if they can pull off a relatively smooth 10.2.6 launch (bug wise), it will be a truly memorable experience. Going in blind to a retail patch will be really special
[0:27:02] physalis4: My rogue is Dark Iron. Best racials in the game
[0:27:13] NeeK_23: you can set camp in your farm spot, HS back to mail box, them go back to camp. Vulpera hacks
[0:27:33] ratgefingah: I made a gnome called prison mike yesterday
[0:27:40] MediumRareOG: How arey you levelling your rogue?
[0:28:02] CloudyHS: yeah ur a content creator, its your job
[0:28:11] Xesol: i dont mean to derail your grind but those lockboxes can contain teebu's and shadowblade so you might want to open before you hand them in lol
[0:28:21] SskygamesS: just lost power for 24 hours
[0:28:34] ratgefingah: its classic na bias, they wont understand cuz they arent in that position
[0:28:37] Xesol: yup
[0:28:43] Sindragozer: ya just gotta leave 1 thing in it
[0:28:47] NeeK_23: Do EU launch and let NA wait, see how thy like it. But they proved that global is possible with SoD
[0:28:50] CloudyHS: well the thing is, that if they do a global launch, you may need to have some of the EU staff working until like 4 am
[0:28:52] CloudyHS: on bugs
[0:29:05] MediumRareOG: The box disappears if you empty it. If you leave one thing in you're fine
[0:29:28] CloudyHS: oh nvm then
[0:29:36] MediumRareOG: That being said, it's WAY too tedious to unlock then check 1000 boxes. I gave up after like 6
[0:29:43] CloudyHS: i think a global release would be important for this, i hope they do it
[0:30:02] CloudyHS: as an NA player i really think they should
[0:30:25] physalis4: I‚Äôm glad we finally have a timeframe for 10.5.6 release.
[0:30:33] NeeK_23: any speculation since it doesnt require DF to play just the sub? Pirates in Booty Bay event?
[0:30:52] stellabellas: mrgmSmile good morning
[0:31:01] CloudyHS: my current cook for 10.2.6 is that its a game-wide massive treasure hunt , like secrets of azeroth on steroids, and itll have some instanced scaling naval combat scenarios culminating in a mini raid against nightsqual
[0:31:03] CloudyHS: LOCK IT IN
[0:31:13] amricatt: Morning.
[0:31:16] DevoidX: do you think that streamers doing PTR content has forced them to do this?
[0:31:37] Suze_o_0: goooooooooood morning!
[0:31:58] CloudyHS: i dont think they did this as a reaction to anything, i think they saw some of the magic of SoD and wanted to capture a bit of it in retail
[0:32:03] SskygamesS: have you done like bingo what we can expect for this "secret patch"
[0:32:11] MediumRareOG: I'm afraid anything not tested will turn into a shit show
[0:32:17] Suze_o_0: guess what?
[0:32:24] Akela3: i don't think they're forced to do anything. i think they want to try something different.
[0:32:27] physalis4: They want it to be a surprise and a certain website has an addiction to data mine things to death
[0:32:32] Suze_o_0: Today is 54 trips around the sun for me :)
[0:32:51] SskygamesS: FeelsBirthdayMan
[0:32:51] Suze_o_0: yaaassss im an old woman today
[0:32:53] ratgefingah: happy bday
[0:32:56] Sindragozer: @Suze_o_0 happy birthday!
[0:32:56] Kozzna: Happy Birthday!!
[0:32:58] physalis4: Happy birthday @suze_o_0
[0:32:59] Forgiven78: Happy Birthday, @Suze_o_0
[0:33:00] WhyDaRumGone: 54? Don't look at day over 22
[0:33:03] Suze_o_0: yea, gonna be lazy af today
[0:33:04] NeeK_23: 10.2.5 had stuff in it??? it wasnt in the dig LuL
[0:33:09] CloudyHS: im willing to give them some slack on a bumpy launch, theyre trying out something new and fun, but obviouslyi hope its smooth
[0:33:10] ellenara35: @Suze_o_0 happy birthday!!
[0:33:13] shaypressplay: Happy Birthday @Suze_o_0 . I will be 55 in June so right there with you!
[0:33:22] databob1: happy didn't die day
[0:33:46] SskygamesS: is so many things happening in march i dont think this patch have something related to calendar events
[0:33:51] databob1: sorry thought it was cleaver soory
[0:33:57] NeeK_23: you can just dps on training dummys
[0:34:04] Suze_o_0: thank you everyone!
[0:34:11] CloudyHS: the one thing i hate the most about 10.2.5 is that one of the achievs for the archives meta requires like 10 weeks of world quests and RNG
[0:34:36] CloudyHS: the one to assist nirobin at all the locations
[0:34:46] CloudyHS: uneed to do 3 clue finding world quests at each world quest locations
[0:34:49] CloudyHS: its insane
[0:35:12] SskygamesS: i mean  we still have like 3 more months on dragonflight minium
[0:35:15] CerebrillUK: for the Nirobin achievement, its fortunately just 3 of 1 of the world quests, not all 6 diff ones
[0:35:23] CloudyHS: foul creature
[0:35:24] NeeK_23: big vault btw?
[0:35:25] ratgefingah: jesus who is he
[0:35:27] SskygamesS: im so suprise
[0:35:29] Shocklate_: DansGame
[0:35:33] databob1: nice blades
[0:35:35] NeeK_23: MECHAROGUE !! Big W
[0:35:39] athrem01: Why?!
[0:35:41] marithered0203: I also have a mechagnome rogue heheh
[0:35:41] StreamElements: Click on my link www.hellofresh.co.uk/MRGM and order your Box for less than ¬£4 per meal!
[0:35:47] CloudyHS: you were just kicking cans! that was ur rogues family, dan!
[0:35:56] ratgefingah: u got the dm buffs?
[0:36:05] ratgefingah: ye
[0:36:07] SskygamesS: does the follower dungeons work for chromie too?
[0:36:17] CloudyHS: kinda is doing a lot of work in that sentence
[0:36:17] ratgefingah: 60
[0:36:21] SskygamesS: gotcha
[0:36:29] NeeK_23: sub rogue?
[0:36:32] Big_Rum: oh so same as your hunter
[0:36:38] SskygamesS: hekili is so bad for rogue LUL
[0:36:45] CloudyHS: combat rogue can find treasure on the minimap so make sure u check that
[0:36:52] CloudyHS: outlaw*
[0:36:54] NeeK_23: the only one I can play is Ass Rogue, the other 2 confuse me
[0:36:58] Xesol: i think the "fastest" is burning crusade dungeons once each with the quests in them to start
[0:36:59] Big_Rum: you using your hertitge armor?>
[0:37:11] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[0:37:36] athrem01: Why not level it to max?
[0:37:55] CloudyHS: did u use your TWW 70 boost?
[0:38:01] SskygamesS: well i know one fatest way but you need some help for that pepeLaugh getting teleport to azure span and having chat helping you
[0:38:19] stregnor: did you pick up skinning and leatherwork?
[0:38:39] Xesol: in TWW you wont need 2x of the same class, any alt can get you the mog appearance if im understanding warbands correctly
[0:38:54] TheNihilistOne: When is the pirate patch coming?
[0:39:06] AlfredK: You mean the chainsaw sword?
[0:39:11] Xesol: ah makes sense
[0:39:25] AlfredK: There are different recolors of it
[0:39:30] Big_Rum: So there is an achievemewnt that pop up when i amin felwood called the diplomat. you need to be exaulted with 3 factions Timbermaw Sporegaurd and Mag'har. The onei need is Mag'har.. Where do i farm that rep?
[0:39:34] MediumRareOG: What's your levelling plan? Happy to provide tips/suggestions if you want
[0:39:34] Forgiven78: Look at that smexy tin can!
[0:39:36] CloudyHS: i got the liberated slyvern after 264 attempts yesterday
[0:39:47] NeeK_23: I still need to get that sword, is so cool
[0:40:07] porto_ffxiv: @big_rum that‚Äôs the horde faction in outlands , nagrand
[0:40:11] Big_Rum: yes
[0:40:17] Big_Rum: ahh okay thanks
[0:40:27] amricatt: So. I was lurking a lot near the end of your stream and missed why the rogue.
[0:40:46] esbi__: You need mech mount to be complete
[0:41:02] amricatt: Ah, okay. He looks pretty badass.
[0:41:29] amricatt: They don't look too bad in a robe.
[0:41:41] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:42:08] MediumRareOG: I have a mechagnome warlock that i'v emade look as gnomey as possible. looks pretty good
[0:42:13] marithered0203: Omg this quest
[0:42:20] databob1: they look ok in alot of the plate sets
[0:43:01] AlfredK: I wish mechagnome. dark iron etc would have been just extra customization instead of cluterring the character customization with new races that are the exact same
[0:43:01] MediumRareOG: look gnomey, as in the most non-mech customizations
[0:43:12] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:43:47] Big_Rum: I think I am gonna use my 70 boost on a a Druid. i have always loved that Class and never really played it
[0:43:59] marithered0203: I dont remember.. I only remember frustration
[0:44:12] fooxytv: I was too late to get a ticket :(
[0:44:23] NeeK_23: I've started the gearing of my boomie for tha All Druid raid
[0:44:51] TheNihilistOne: any news on the pirate patch?
[0:45:11] MediumRareOG: @Big_Rum FWIW druid is the easiest class in the game to level. instant queues if you level as bear
[0:45:17] Ithylz: and it releases in March
[0:45:24] TheNihilistOne: oh in march
[0:45:32] TheNihilistOne: wonder what it is
[0:45:47] amricatt: I wonder if it will be heavily TWW lore and hence the surprise.
[0:46:24] esbi__: They rly want this one to be a surprise
[0:46:38] TheNihilistOne: i wonder if its a seperate story or a story thats part of the main story going into The War Within
[0:47:11] michaelmm: I think they mean that classic players could do the event on retail at any level and without having to buy DF.
[0:47:12] Chesscape: but if it is on classic, why is it not on classic roadmap?
[0:47:17] Larkaro: but what happens if 10.2.6 is not a banger patch
[0:47:41] AlfredK: Yea I think so too
[0:47:42] amricatt: Oh that's interesting.
[0:48:00] NeeK_23: thats how I read it, just a sub and its not level locked
[0:48:03] TheNihilistOne: why would it be a classic story
[0:48:08] TheNihilistOne: makes no sence
[0:48:09] esbi__: So maybe it is Vampire survivors mod
[0:48:41] StreamElements: Love is in the Air 2024 UPDATES! New Mount, Quests, Transmogs, Dragon Customizations & MORE - https://youtu.be/E4WuJuhtv9o
[0:49:01] physalis4: cursed
[0:49:11] AlfredK: Lol it is so cursed
[0:49:13] amricatt: Oh yes, put on the love witch.
[0:49:20] Akela3: its a look that's for sure
[0:49:34] MachoCham: Can't believe you're playing Rogue. Who are you and what have you done with Dan?
[0:49:58] AlfredK: You can't have just one leg or arm be robotic right?
[0:50:01] Vengeful_Hermit: Ravenoldt rep waas an anoying grind
[0:50:15] amricatt: Does the rogue have to be a certain level only or max?
[0:50:42] AlfredK: I thought it was just after you got stealth so idk
[0:50:48] Vengeful_Hermit: At least they removed that old dungeon rep from dire maul if you are working on the insane title.
[0:51:46] AlfredK: Can you get that old Zul Gurub rep after they added the old stuff a while back?
[0:51:52] Vengeful_Hermit: I want to say it was in cata. It was limited by bag space and you wanted to be an engineer to drop the mailbox.
[0:52:29] BBMezzy: Don't let the buff fall off from jumping over the fences
[0:52:56] breninn3: At least you're not having to round up 5 troggs this time
[0:53:03] BBMezzy: It increases the amount of points you get from gnolls
[0:54:14] Vengeful_Hermit: I had to macro the target zep
[0:54:24] BBMezzy: Use the 3 fences in the middle and the gnolls around them, don't need to run around the entire arena that way and it allows you to stack the buff high
[0:54:36] DevoidX: if you are just trying to level why dont you skip this?
[0:55:10] BBMezzy: That achievement was incredibly frustrating
[0:55:19] COOP3R: you deserve it
[0:55:32] DevoidX: Monster? don't tell RedBull
[0:55:39] RehRehh: what event
[0:55:41] StreamElements: Click on my link www.hellofresh.co.uk/MRGM and order your Box for less than ¬£4 per meal!
[0:55:50] AlfredK: How many tickets was it in total?
[0:56:04] databob1: @mrgm Dan you sold out! in the best way possible
[0:56:08] supermaduro24: @mrgm  question so so this way I‚Äôm going to play world of Warcraft season of discovery phase 2 I‚Äôm going to start from lvl 1 to lvl 40 can I do like that @mrgm  ? I‚Äôm so hype for phase 2
[0:56:22] MachoCham: mrgmSell mrgmSell mrgmSell
[0:56:47] MachoCham: Sean didn't get one
[0:56:50] MachoCham: And he has flights booked
[0:56:51] CerebrillUK: most hotels you can cancel 24-48 hrs before then though
[0:56:53] RehRehh: you can handle it
[0:56:54] BBMezzy: That's their responsibility though, should've waited to get a ticket before booking hotels
[0:56:55] MachoCham: loljk
[0:56:55] WoWRoach: Hotels are usually refundable.  Most of the time you just put a card on file to hold it
[0:56:58] amricatt: @supermaduro24 You can.  They are providing a buff from 1 to 25.
[0:56:59] Big_Rum: Did the streamers have to get Tickets?

[0:57:30] NeeK_23: *afternoon
[0:57:37] MachoCham: The tickets are literally just to make sure we're in capacity for fire regs
[0:57:46] supermaduro24: @amricatt  I don‚Äôt like to lvl faster lol so I we‚Äôll do the long way which is from lvl 1 to lvl 40
[0:58:08] MachoCham: I got 12
[0:58:13] NeeK_23: people can still hang out on the sunday with people too I gess
[0:58:17] AlfredK: Well if they booked a hotel without it being refundable before getting a ticket they can only blame themselves.
[0:58:55] MachoCham: TBF Glad we did a ticket system with this interest
[0:58:55] amricatt: @supermaduro24 I completely agree with you but I'm not sure you're going to be able to turn off the buff.  Hopefully you can try.
[0:59:03] NeeK_23: just based on the discord numbers, I knew it'd sell out
[0:59:09] DevoidX: yeah. i believed you so thats why i didn't rush to get a ticket. :(
[0:59:36] supermaduro24: ok @amricatt  I‚Äôm going to start tomorrow when phase 2 come out

[1:00:11] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:00:51] BBMezzy: What level are the murlocs?
[1:00:53] Big_Rum: so do you pick pocket NPC's or other players?
[1:01:03] MediumRareOG: You in war mode?
[1:01:09] physalis4: seeing a tiny robot with chainsaw swords is terrifying
[1:01:11] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:01:24] jRizzler: Good morning
[1:01:25] Xesol: wait thats way slower i think
[1:01:33] Xesol: lbrs you can pickpocket the entire instance then reset
[1:01:35] jRizzler: What did you think? KEKW
[1:01:38] Big_Rum: what level i sthat zone? you dont want to go there and get ganked
[1:01:44] MediumRareOG: WoD intro is a good one to get you to 30 since you can't fly in it anyway and then you'll have flying
[1:01:50] MachoCham: Alright Dave Meltzer
[1:01:58] jRizzler: No PTR testing is a wild thing to hear. TBH @MrGM
[1:02:08] MediumRareOG: Oh is that the garrison hearthstone? maybe you've done the wod intro already
[1:02:27] jRizzler: I wish this would be more of a common thing, tbh
[1:02:31] jRizzler: Less spoilers, more surprises.
[1:02:37] NeeK_23: cant remember but does opening the map show you the level for that zone. I guess that was a pre chromie time thing
[1:02:47] supermaduro24: @amricatt  I‚Äôm hype for phase 2 and cataclysm classic and the new world of Warcraft retail expansion I also lay other games and mmo
[1:03:12] supermaduro24: play
[1:03:18] jRizzler: How much do you want to bet that the patch drops at the same time as the Hearthstone Anniversary event? @MrGM ?
[1:03:32] jRizzler: They did say March.
[1:03:36] jRizzler: Anni is in March.
[1:03:41] NeeK_23: the bonus is that with chromie time, you'll be unlikely to be fighting for tags with others
[1:03:50] MachoCham: WoD intro is still great XP/Hour
[1:03:53] MachoCham: Maw as well
[1:03:55] MediumRareOG: WoD intro is the best xp in the game
[1:04:06] AlfredK: WoWhead will be in shambles if they do less PTRs lol. It is nice to go in blind.
[1:04:29] MediumRareOG: make sure you're in warmode, of course

[1:04:41] jRizzler: @AlfredK TBF they haven't been doing themselves any favours constantly, blatantly posting spoilers.
[1:04:49] physalis4: I do think it‚Äôs kinda funny WoWHead can‚Äôt do anything for this patch
[1:04:55] amricatt: WoWhead are still releasing 17 articles a day even in a drought.
[1:04:56] AlfredK: @AlfredK Yea it sucks
[1:04:56] Bears_Adventures: LFG Event Hyyyyyype! bearsa9Hype2
[1:04:59] jRizzler: Without the spoiler tag, I mean.
[1:05:06] databob1: love the WOD intro best part of the xpac
[1:05:38] MachoCham: Did Jake get his ticket?
[1:05:50] JakeSezz: Did ya? Fuck. That‚Äôs what I get for having my Discord notifications muted lmao I‚Äôll go check
[1:06:06] JakeSezz: Hell no cuz Jake‚Äôs old ass was asleep when they dropped üò©üò≠
[1:06:08] Bears_Adventures: I did! Got 3 :) me, my other half and my friend are coming! Soooo excited!
[1:06:11] Bears_Adventures: Thanks for organising it!
[1:06:13] MediumRareOG: select WoD in chromie time to get the intro quest to teleport you to blasted lands btw
[1:07:15] NeeK_23: the wod treasure and bonus objectives are still good, I just hate wod so choose to level slower
[1:07:27] MediumRareOG: WoD intro takes 30-40 minutes and should get you to level 30ish
[1:07:54] AlfredK: I mean it is called Insane in the membrane for a reason lol
[1:08:04] MediumRareOG: DMF, warmode, yes and yes
[1:08:46] MediumRareOG: dalaran hearthstone is a quicker way back too
[1:09:11] esbi__: What is that mount?
[1:09:26] JakeSezz: However, whilst I‚Äôm sad at the moment, I can‚Äôt help but also being SUPER fucking hyped for you & the event! I told ya that it would go quicker than you expected saltyb27Cheers
[1:09:28] Vengeful_Hermit: If you do insane make sure you are willing to do the really long grind on that toon to have both reps exalted at once. I dumped mine (bucaneer rep) before I became a completionist and there is no way I'm grinding that out again.
[1:10:10] MediumRareOG: @Vengeful_Hermit that stings
[1:10:31] MediumRareOG: @esbi__ one of the emerald dream mounts
[1:10:42] TheExodarus: @JakeSezz I missed out :'
[1:11:10] esbi__: @esbi__ Thank you :D It looks awesome
[1:11:14] TheExodarus: I pray
[1:11:36] JakeSezz: @theexodarus FeelsBadMan
[1:11:53] MediumRareOG: warmode :)
[1:12:47] MediumRareOG: oh woops, i thought you were higher level. my bad. WoD intro is like ~5 levels
[1:13:00] MediumRareOG: it might be worth doing elwynn quests to 20
[1:13:10] NeeK_23: maybe if you have them all it wont show
[1:13:18] AlfredK: 55 euros down from 150 I think
[1:13:27] amricatt: No, it showed for me even though I had them all.
[1:13:34] ratgefingah: 50 euros here
[1:14:09] MachoCham: Bull Riding when
[1:14:11] ratgefingah: thats crazy
[1:14:35] ratgefingah: no shadowlands tw? Sadge Kappa
[1:14:40] MediumRareOG: lunar festival beams are free xp too
[1:14:47] MachoCham: Maw is decent XP
[1:15:34] jRizzler: Uhhh... apparently ATT is showing the items from the Hearthstone Event? @MrGM
[1:15:35] breninn3: I find Elwynn super spread out, BFA start is quicker right?
[1:15:40] MediumRareOG: elwynn quests are super quick, around the farmer south of DMF. up to you of course

[1:17:24] physalis4: Mammoths on the other hand are obnoxiously big
[1:17:40] MediumRareOG: the route i got from from this speedrun youtuber for non-tanks is: elwynn (to a point) -> redridge (to a point) -> duskwood (to a point) -> WoD intro

[1:21:57] ratgefingah: well
[1:22:19] ratgefingah: wouldnt u have to get them all again?
[1:22:28] ratgefingah: mole machines i mean
[1:22:36] Layliah79: Having to go thru 252 items in our systems because someone put 2023 in January instead of 2024. Fixing them all is so tedious :(
[1:22:39] Bware2: mechagnomes have built in anvil and cooking fire... beats mole machine ;)
[1:23:03] MachoCham: BSK
[1:23:04] Lakatarmen: and they have the ability to pick lockboxes xd
[1:23:06] ratgefingah: that ability looks cool af
[1:23:21] Shocklate_: I still call it combat rogue
[1:23:26] physalis4: Roll the bones is super important
[1:23:38] Shocklate_: its called OUTLAW POOGERS
[1:23:42] AlfredK: No they changed it to outlaw in legion
[1:23:54] ratgefingah: @Shocklate_ I call it pirate shoot ya in the face rogue
[1:24:24] physalis4: when I hear outlaw I think old western cowboys not pirates
[1:24:39] Shocklate_: KKona
[1:25:07] ratgefingah: transmog on mechagnome is almost as good as on evoker xdd
[1:25:53] MachoCham: Dropped in to @Sarcissa earlier, great streamer
[1:26:11] Shirey12: You get the rocket yet?
[1:26:32] BBMezzy: A M+ member got the love rocket last night.. naturally I had no choice but to kick him from the team
[1:26:35] Shirey12: Damn, after 14 years I got it last night
[1:26:36] amricatt: Facts.
[1:27:16] Shirey12: I still need the manuscript for the proto drake
[1:27:24] DoubleDownDiplo: Hey Boss you play Wrath Classic?
[1:27:41] breninn3: I just use Litemount and I get a random mount each time which is nice
[1:27:53] MediumRareOG: i feel like that about transmog. level 10s with thunderfury or frostmourne? wtf
[1:27:54] DoubleDownDiplo: Was going to ask for Cata Classic Pre Patch Date prediction
[1:29:31] Big_Rum: well it is only 5 levels
[1:29:44] breninn3: I bought the Valajar ensemble from Trading Post, was so annoyed when I realised it's for Leather wearers, I play 3 plate characters
[1:29:44] DoubleDownDiplo: I've heard from people in my guild it could possibly be June/July pre patch release
[1:30:11] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM

[1:38:14] specialkidmiles: new alt?
[1:38:16] Haestoh: I'm losing track of days
[1:38:30] MediumRareOG: you're outlaw spec? i only ever played sub
[1:38:31] specialkidmiles: for completionist?
[1:38:34] JakeSezz: Roll The Bones is so good
[1:38:41] specialkidmiles: ohh
[1:38:46] scandalouzzz: why not make a class trial?
[1:38:53] Haestoh: having shadowstep keybound to 1 is triggering me
[1:39:12] Iwony: hello everyone.
[1:39:20] isillytoy: @MrGM the health potion for roge is great to
[1:39:34] breninn3: What's a rogues favourite type of shoes?    Sneakers
[1:39:41] JakeSezz: @scandalouzzz It was quite the revelation yesterday that trading was a no-no
[1:39:55] Iwony: Don't you love layoffs.... my company just announced they will get rid of 8% of their workforce.....
[1:39:58] Vorryk: I loved WoD leveling except this scenario.  We start without Teron Gorefield, Gul'dan, and Cho'gall imprisoned.  We know the chaos they caused in our timeline.  and we....  let me out...
[1:40:02] dustinrichie: @breninn3 :D
[1:40:04] Vorryk: *let them out
[1:40:10] Haestoh: Keybind 1 in my mind is always the "main" or filler ability in a rotation.
[1:40:15] Iwony: I'll not stay in any case
[1:40:24] Faeynna: What do you think about no ptr for 10.2.6? :) I love it
[1:40:39] JakeSezz: The only thing I kinda don‚Äôt like about my Mechagnome Rogue is that I have 2 different lock picks, which is sorta unnecessary. But the other racial abilities are fantastic
[1:40:56] Jack_the_Dipper: Did you get aa response on your Tweeet?
[1:41:05] breninn3: @Iwony Honestly best choice, layoffs are usually followed up by more and getting out asap is usually a good call. Hopefully they offer a decent severance package
[1:41:09] Faeynna: Yeah, if they do stuff like that, global launch is a must
[1:41:41] specialkidmiles: what time would you pick for a global launch monkaHmm
[1:41:48] AlfredK: We need a european office again. I would also love to work there :>
[1:42:19] BBMezzy: I'd hate that as a release time
[1:42:36] michaelmm: Also in one in Cork.
[1:42:43] AlfredK: Do they actually have devs there?
[1:43:06] AlfredK: Wasn't there a big office in france a few years ago?
[1:43:17] michaelmm: AFIK they have server devs in Cork.
[1:43:44] JakeSezz: As an NA player, I would personally be okay with a later release here so that it could be global release. I dunno if I‚Äôm in the minority for that, but still hahaha
[1:43:45] Iwony: other side
[1:43:58] MediumRareOG: there are 3 groups of huts
[1:44:28] LuiBMHunter: just avoid streamers ermm oh mebbe not :)

[1:45:15] Iwony: @breninn3 yeah been already thinking about leaving for a while and the market for software developers is really not bad at all so..... been at the comp for almost 17 years now O_o
[1:45:21] Faeynna: There's no downside for the playerbase if there's a a global release.
[1:45:29] JakeSezz: Just saw your message‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm a total loser
[1:45:38] MediumRareOG: i've done this intro 60 times
[1:45:59] Faeynna: And the devs could do fun stuff like secrets etc, that won't be spoiled for non US servers.
[1:46:03] Iwony: ok you beat me I did it like 30 but .... geez
[1:46:16] Faeynna: It was
[1:46:27] JakeSezz: I can‚Äôt do this intro anymore cuz I‚Äôve done it what *feels* like 60 times mrgmO mrgmHehe
[1:46:33] michaelmm: Secrets of Azeroth was global but also super buggy when they released it.
[1:47:03] michaelmm: There were devs in the Secret Finding Discord patching stuff as we found it.
[1:47:07] Faeynna: So I hope that 1.2.6 will launch say March 5/6, but the things in it, just activates the week after, at the same time.
[1:47:14] michaelmm: They even worked over the weekend.
[1:47:16] amricatt: They finally fixed the blue and white box in the cinematic.
[1:47:50] amricatt: Meritha was a blue and white box saying goodbye to her mother.
[1:47:53] AlfredK: The placeholder/no model thingy
[1:47:55] samadan: Just swinging by to say hi and thanks for organizing LFG in May. Looking forward to it!
[1:48:16] amricatt: Yep.  I did it on one character and then later did it on another and it was fixed.
[1:48:34] Jack_the_Dipper: Hey @samadan

[2:18:57] Arlaeya: tried it last night murlocks spawn quicker than LBRS. but I just pickpocket, no kill, i just run and grab the boxes and keep doing rounds
[2:19:06] dastago: oh are you doing the insane achiev?
[2:19:19] Arlaeya: Yeah the boxes regenerate
[2:19:30] Arlaeya: the loot respawns so I stay stealthed the whole time
[2:19:36] Lausten: Its like 5 minute respawn or so I think
[2:19:42] MediumRareOG: iirc the boxes regenerate super slowly. you may as well just kill them
[2:19:43] Arlaeya: i'm level 70, super easy
[2:19:52] NeeK_23: aggro range changes with level
[2:19:54] Xesol: interesting didnt know they did that
[2:20:18] NeeK_23: you can almost stand next to them at level 70 and not aggro
[2:20:18] Arlaeya: by the time I make it down the coast, loot is back
[2:20:58] Layliah79: Chromie time?
[2:20:58] Arlaeya: yeah... i'd get a bit higher first
[2:21:02] NeeK_23: you could always check and science it, and if it doesnt work, grind a few more levels
[2:21:12] Layliah79: true.
[2:21:16] RAF_Sean: Where do you need to go? I can pop on and fly you wherever
[2:21:31] Xesol: dont forget to buy bags lol
[2:21:38] Lausten: Might as well just bring the character to 70 for an extra alt ;)
[2:21:47] jessetenfour: What you gonna do on the Isle?
[2:21:48] Natolaeh: isnt garrison heartstone in your toybox?
[2:21:53] dastago: can you believe wod came out 10 years ago this year. literally half the game's life ago
[2:22:33] Layliah79: I believe it. I moved to Texas a month before it released.
[2:22:39] Layliah79: been 10 years Dx
[2:22:55] Lausten: Really 10 years? I was clean for a year inbetween MoP and WoD then an addict for the past 10 years.. Kappa
[2:22:58] dastago: @Natolaeh you need a garrison to hearth to tho lol
[2:23:07] Layliah79: i was looking for a job. so i would do my job hunting in the morning, then play Wod rest of the day lol
[2:23:35] Layliah79: still at that same job i got too right now lol
[2:23:36] Vidaloo: I'm confused, what are you fishing for in pickpocketting the mobs in Quel'Danas?
[2:23:42] dastago: i was 14 when wod came out - i can remember being so anxious to get home from school the day it launched
[2:23:56] Iwony: not really the garrison was a mess and you could not progress ....
[2:24:07] Xesol: @Vidaloo reputation with ravenholdt, you get lockboxes to turn in
[2:24:13] Iwony: I went to bed and tried a day later

[2:37:12] Dunkurk: The downside to summer is that one week of 28-32C the Uk gets hammered with that makes you question the point of living
[2:37:15] dastago: uk winter is particularly bad. i went to france around this time last year and it felt a lot less miserable weather-wise
[2:37:29] Dunkurk: Soup week i call it
[2:37:44] Lumimyrsky: Tbh I spent Christmas and New years in the UK, I was rather surprised by the wind haha

[2:38:54] NeeK_23: do you have the flight path unlocked? do you have the heirlom maps
[2:39:01] spencer_zero_: Remember when the country caught fire in 2022?
[2:39:05] AlfredK: We are going to WISH for winter in a few months lol
[2:39:27] spencer_zero_: Wow, these decorations are really striking.
[2:39:31] spencer_zero_: They really pop out now.
[2:39:32] Dunkurk: full on white out snow is the best weather we get
[2:39:33] Crumsa: Hey man
[2:39:43] Lumimyrsky: That period between summer and autumn is just perfect. Or between Spring and summer.
[2:39:46] MediumRareOG: "way more effort than its' worth" is like the completionist motto
[2:39:53] Dunkurk: did you use the TBC FP toy?

[2:40:04] ludey: how's that character boost lookin'?
[2:40:21] Xesol: feels bad
[2:40:42] MediumRareOG: get the dalaran hearthstone

[2:41:08] TwynSun: TwynSun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:41:22] MediumRareOG: No, choose legion CT -> go to NPC -> skip intro -> complete quest get HS
[2:41:29] MachoCham: Don't get what? What are we referring to?
[2:41:55] Crumsa: Do you think they will refund the gold for the maps since they said every character will have every FP that you have found on on your account for TWW?
[2:42:11] Crumsa: Sadge
[2:42:21] LuiBMHunter: hs is toy now - no need to ever do the expansion surely?
[2:42:28] MachoCham: Nah they won't as you had access to it for that cost for that long
[2:42:38] LuiBMHunter: huh
[2:42:42] AlfredK: What really?
[2:42:57] MachoCham: Can't use Dala HS or Garrison HS without unlocking it
[2:43:05] AlfredK: You can go there with a mage portal so
[2:43:21] AlfredK: Nah but dalaran
[2:43:28] LuiBMHunter: there is a cheat to get to the location of the garrison without doing the intro tho
[2:43:28] MediumRareOG: alts is kinda my area of expertise :) dalaran HS takes ~3 minutes. it's the first thing i do on any alts with ports
[2:43:31] MachoCham: Dala HS use would be locked to the quest id completed
[2:43:39] LuiBMHunter: nodnod
[2:45:16] LuiBMHunter: bully!

[3:07:44] AlfredK: Yea, why don't they just update the skyboxes... it would help the old zones look way better. They really need to update the night sky. Looks really dated.
[3:07:49] Dunkurk: so ink black you buy it at the DMF for 3g33s33c and they last 2 hours each

[3:12:25] SlapControl: how does this grind work?
[3:12:28] NeeK_23: I killed them after pickpocketing a pack. they respawn just was fast and then they have new boxes.
[3:13:37] Iwony: been at it the whole day
[3:13:43] breninn3: 1/333 chance after the first kill of the day right?
[3:13:47] BBMezzy: Every non-zero chance is worth it
[3:13:49] Vidaloo: I think they said it's really the first one per Bnet account
[3:13:56] MediumRareOG: honestly i don't think they've increased the first drop chance by much
[3:13:56] NeeK_23: its the old super low drop chance, so its not worthless but its alot of time
[3:14:05] Vidaloo: I got super lucky and got it on my first try
[3:14:06] SlapControl: do the boxes themself give rep?

[3:16:34] MediumRareOG: by my calculations, doing the love rocket daily 700 times gives a 20% chance of getting the mount

[3:22:35] mather2829: Kyoto beby <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[3:23:03] apollymae: Florida weather is the same. its crap weather or too hot

[3:24:06] zantos2020: In the central US we can get all 4 season in a single day
[3:24:07] physalis4: We get tornados here. It's scary af
[3:24:08] Harper_n7: rip ad, but yeah, that's a really odd comparison
[3:24:10] MediumRareOG: 21C in florida rn. "winter"
[3:24:50] Keirmot: 20 in Lisbon.
[3:24:56] Dunkurk: @breninn3 I love florida swamp man
[3:25:10] Dunkurk: I liked when he took his swamp puppy hunting to the amazon
[3:25:14] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:25:19] dastago: you should try taking vitamin d tablets. helps me a bit
[3:25:34] breninn3: It's an Alligator, yeah. There's a YouTuber called FishingGarrett who walks around florida swamps looking at animals and yoinking invasive species out of the area
[3:25:37] breninn3: He's NUTS
[3:25:46] MediumRareOG: I did enjoy the sun being out at 9-10pm in summer when i lived in the UK
[3:26:05] Dunkurk: He picks up snakes and stuff taht dont belong therr and takes them away
[3:26:08] Dunkurk: all whilst barefoot
[3:26:09] breninn3: Burmese Pythons for example, will catch them barehanded because they shouldn't be there
[3:26:12] apollymae: When it rains too much you get the gators in your in ground pool
[3:26:15] breninn3: Does it all barefoot, the madlad
[3:26:16] MediumRareOG: lionfish are invasive to florida, for example
[3:26:17] mrsrockguru: Burmese pythons are invasive species
[3:26:22] physalis4: boas in the FL Everglades. They were ppl's pets and then when they got too big ppl ditched them
[3:26:30] breninn3: Released from the pet trade
[3:26:33] LuiBMHunter: nope opening the chests on the ground as you go? no point?
[3:26:36] physalis4: then they started breeding in the wild
[3:26:42] MediumRareOG: there are tons of invasive species in the US unfortunately
[3:26:43] mrsrockguru: escaped or people abondoned them
[3:26:51] breninn3: Give it a watch, he's insane
[3:26:52] Vidaloo: They got introduced by some dude who lost it and then several people did that and they reproduced
[3:27:02] Vidaloo: The issue is that they don't have natural predators
[3:27:07] breninn3: Same with Chameleons, certain Geckos etc
[3:27:08] zantos2020: Aren't iguana's considered invasive now?
[3:27:11] Vidaloo: But a F-load of preys
[3:27:18] Iwony: too cold
[3:27:20] Dunkurk: we have a few invasive species in the UK
[3:27:26] Iwony: too cold for snakes
[3:27:32] LuiBMHunter: wonder if the drop rate is higher for higher levels ?
[3:27:33] nyrhalahotep: if you ever get lost in the Woods, just build a house, then you'll be home.
[3:27:36] breninn3: Grey Squirrels are invasive
[3:27:38] Dunkurk: We have asian hornets here now
[3:27:39] amricatt: We have two giant domesticated rabbits running around a neighborhood.  We think someone dumped them.
[3:27:53] death_cam_: asian hornets
[3:27:57] dastago: there are attempts to bring lynxes and other animals back into the uk. they went extinct here a while ago
[3:27:58] CrowMomocle: I remember that about the grey squirrels
[3:28:03] mrsrockguru: Yep they were brought over form america and escaped
[3:28:03] death_cam_: they are really bad for bees
[3:28:06] Iwony: we got like 3 kinds of snakes , but invasive species... all countries have them our days
[3:28:08] Vidaloo: Yeah Asian Hornets are actually scary
[3:28:08] breninn3: Yeah, they shouldn't be here, they out compete the smaller Red Squirrels who's numbers are massively reduced because of it
[3:28:11] MachoCham: Nah, red ones are native
[3:28:18] CrowMomocle: didn't they depose the red squirrels?
[3:28:19] physalis4: In GA we have Jorro Spiders. They are from Japan and came here off container ships. They are orb spiders as big as your hand
[3:28:21] dastago: red squirrels were native to the uk the grey ones came from america
[3:28:22] Dunkurk: They are massive
[3:28:23] michaelmm: Asian Hornets are terrible as they prey on honey bees and can wipe out hives in a few days.
[3:28:23] MachoCham: Crayfish are also invasive
[3:28:23] mrsrockguru: uk's native squirrel is the red squirrel
[3:28:32] NeeK_23: greys came from america and dominated the reds
[3:28:37] death_cam_: asian hornets are like the size of your average finger
[3:28:38] Dunkurk: Asian Hornets could rob you with their stinger like a knife
[3:28:45] nyrhalahotep: great, kaiju hornets
[3:28:50] physalis4: Look up Jorro Spider lol
[3:29:01] CrowMomocle: nasty things
[3:29:14] physalis4: They are EVERYH
[3:29:18] physalis4: everywhere in the fall
[3:29:21] zantos2020: That looks like a banana spider
[3:29:25] breninn3: Give FishingGarrett a watch after stream, well worh it
[3:29:42] breninn3: We have invasive plants too, Japanese Knotweed for example
[3:29:52] MediumRareOG: asian carp are a funny invasive species. they get scared and jup in the air. there are tons of videos
[3:30:07] Dunkurk: once youve seen a few of his florida everglades ones watch his "Holiday" to the amazon
[3:30:11] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:30:11] breninn3: You can have mortgages declined if your house has Japanese Knotweed within 10 metres of a house
[3:30:29] MachoCham: It will destroy it
[3:30:40] zantos2020: Snakehead fish are invasive in FL, they came here because some dude didn't want to pay import tax from Asia so he started raising his own and they got out.
[3:30:41] BusterDonuts: @MrGM how many days does it take to get 270 tokens if you do the quests... like how many days of dailies
[3:30:53] amricatt: Lion fish are invasive here on the east coast.
[3:30:55] MediumRareOG: you can drive a boat down a river with asian carp and they will jump in the boat. like tons of them
[3:31:00] breninn3: They should be here
[3:31:14] MachoCham: That would be pretty pooh

[3:33:36] havoom01: did you got atleast 100 boxes?
[3:34:03] breninn3: The reintroduction of Wolves in Yellowstone is a really good read, how much changed just by reintroducing a key predator to an area. The plan is to try and do that in the UK because of the amount of deer with no predators
[3:34:17] MachoCham: Rule of thumb: Give me free shit
[3:34:23] MediumRareOG: success breeds success
[3:34:34] Dunkurk: just think how much bigger next years can be with them

[3:57:55] CrowMomocle: They make far too much money at Blizzcon to not have one.
[3:57:57] Goblocker: I would think blizz would be busy with War

[3:58:24] MediumRareOG: what exploit got fixed?
[3:58:59] MachoCham: People say they make a lot of money but is that bottom line balance sheet public knowledge or assumption?
