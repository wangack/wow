[3:00:26] GAMER_AT: yup true
[3:00:27] LukeDouke: no loot boxes is much better
[3:00:27] Happy_Forest: there would be like at least 8 skins for each event that you could earn for free
[3:00:28] mehdi186: Blizzard managed to make us miss loot boxes bruh
[3:00:28] DylanDominator: getting rid of lootboxes just destroyed all incentive to play the game LUL
[3:00:29] FabulousTurtwig: yeah you would get a bunch of event skins for free
[3:00:29] lolimoutoppai: they're giving the halloween skins for free cause of the first week of server issues
[3:00:29] Strippur: the weapon charm makes it worth it

[3:00:45] Seazei: no incentive to play anymore
[3:00:45] saway____: no one bought lootboxes they were too generous

[3:01:16] twitchshark0: @donoJay Nobody was against loot boxes... You could buy the skins flat out too
[3:01:16] verellic: the way blizzard had loot boxes setup was totally fine, they were easy af to earn
[3:01:18] zaggged: if you can earn them then people will complain they cant buy them

[3:01:43] Agusgreentv: gotham knights time
[3:01:45] noaimandy: @shroud play the new mode
[3:01:47] FranticXL: They fix you to the battlepass then string you along with stiore mounts that you cant earn, its such a shitty business practice.
[3:01:48] parachute187: @Alaziara ah yes pretty much the entire Benelux has benned loot boxes lol

[3:02:00] Spidermash: the prices of skins seems WILD V the price of the battlepass
[3:02:02] twitchshark0: @donoJay Greed, you could earn loot boxes so you had a chance to get legendary skins.
[3:02:03] KingGoblin: why would people complain about free loot boxes it was being able to buy them that was the problem
[3:02:07] A_Naxty: Loot boxes arent getting banned in other countries, PAYING for loot boxes is because its gambling

[4:43:20] Gadaspir: its not a wow raid without addon issues
[4:43:21] MrPink604: not using a manager?
[4:43:23] Tems_aly: Check interface folder
[4:43:23] deathInABucket: @shroud if you extracted the github ZIP directly, it might be one folder too deep. go into the folder for the addon and move everything one folder backward.
[4:43:29] angryslick: That should work!
[4:43:32] senseibeard: isn't it /rcconfig not /rc config
[4:43:35] Cmbine: @deathInABucket yup this is what i think it is
[4:43:37] Kylar_LoL: now

[4:45:37] Alaziara: Shroud You downloaded a folder with the addon folder in it, only put the actual addon folder in
[4:45:41] imMikeyAngelo: @ChubbyMikey I dont think it works anymore
[4:45:42] Cmbine: WoWup is a open source replacement to curseforge
[4:45:45] Tems_aly: @shroud make sure you downloaded to the correct folder
[4:45:49] Baaru5: @shroud if starting WoW fresh, what class should i pick?
[4:45:56] ChubbyMikey: I never use addons, so just curious
[4:45:58] txkxda: @Baaru5 warlock
[4:46:02] sanchezak1990: mage
[4:46:04] OUTLANDSOwyn: Cheer1000 Come back to Outlands ;)
[4:46:08] Baaru5: @txkodaontwitta hrmm why?
[4:46:15] Poketschike: Immortal achivement still going?
[4:46:19] sharm0uta21: @Baaru5 I like warlock, pretty self sufficient and useful for dungeons/raids
[4:46:25] Tems_aly: @Cmbine It doesn't have access to curseforge repository anymore
[4:46:25] OUTLANDSOwyn: bits badge tier notification 
[4:46:26] txkxda: @Baaru5 easy to learn + level imo
[4:46:27] Baaru5: ahh i do like that
[4:46:29] BxRay_: @ChubbyMikey it was, but curseforge changed a bunch of stuff so that wowup doesnt auto update anymore
[4:46:30] sanchezak1990: @baaru5 go for paladin heh
[4:46:34] 0ab_c: punhoAlexS punhoAlexS punhoAlexS

[4:46:37] Cmbine: @Cmbine and?
[4:46:38] sevenofour_: this isnt propnight
[4:46:46] ChubbyMikey: mage is good, but I think Hunter and Warlock are better for a new solo player
[4:46:47] Cmbine: It doesnt need curseforge repository lol
[4:46:52] 2pmdrunk: @Baaru5 paladin. all three class specs are viable. nice if you dont know what you want to do endgame
[4:46:54] Nowski2: your shit wont update lol
[4:47:04] Baaru5: ah so paladin or warlock sounds like
[4:47:06] darksoul_24: All this time and I never knew shroud played WoW
[4:47:15] BxRay_: @ChubbyMikey i play UH DK and it pumps, its tough to not mess up the rotation though
[4:47:20] Alaziara: Shroud You downloaded a folder with the addon folder in it, only put the actual addon folder in
[4:47:23] potatonio: @Baaru5 look at videos of all classes a pick what you like the most

[4:50:23] Cmbine: in dragonflight you wont even need addons outside dps meter and other stuff
[4:50:23] thunderlips__: leeeroy nooo
[4:50:26] Cmbine: im excited
[4:50:46] asbolution_: legit miss wotlk, classic just aint the same vibe. wotlk was the only expac I managed to get world 1sts in
[4:50:49] Veyalz: what class you playing in dragonflight ?
[4:50:56] ViperUK92: ELVUI from wish in dragonflight
[4:50:59] Alaziara: The default ui has a lot of things that are lackluster still
[4:51:05] Alaziara: I hope they continue to work on it
[4:51:09] deathInABucket: @shroud for the loot council addon if you extracted the github ZIP directly, it might be one folder too deep. go into the folder for the addon and move everything one folder backward.
[4:51:21] Alaziara: it does look good for sure
[4:51:25] xhairbait: it'll be nice to not have to rely on good UI addons
[4:51:29] Avinar: it's enough that it's perfectly fine to go stock and has a consistent theme
[4:51:35] asbolution_: Its nice, but i dont see it ever being better than modding the hell out of it
[4:51:35] Psikosis_uk: @deathinabucket it's working now
[4:51:37] albrownn: PepoDance
[4:51:41] Cleavy: they should port it to classic Prayge
[4:51:46] Avinar: then I don't need to update addons or worry about it being out of date
[4:51:50] owpidagoat: love a good wow shroud stream
[4:52:11] Avinar: I'll still use plater though.
[4:52:20] iTzzKarl: (ditto)
[4:52:24] Cmbine: @ins_space its nice tho cause you can now freely rearrange shit, i can basically make the default uia look like my elvui but in a more WoWy way
[4:52:25] deathInABucket: @Psikosis_uk  AYAYA
[4:52:38] BxRay_: see lmao
[4:53:00] BxRay_: hilarious deathgrip animation on aboms
[4:53:02] asbolution_: @ins_space its defo a positive step, but mods still bring too much customisation and qol
[4:53:19] majestic_bbx: whats your gearscore if you dont mind me asking shroud?
[4:53:44] KeennyB: Is there anyone that know what profile he have for that UI on the bars for raid an buffs?
[4:53:46] bengalbroys: pepeMeltdown
[4:53:57] Alaziara: I love this resident dad guild
[4:53:59] asbolution_: what bars?
[4:54:00] undefeated888: chat u think this a sweet deal an asus laptop rtx3060 16gb for $1500and comes with mw2 game
[4:54:13] Avinar: @ins_space while true, a lot really don't need or care for a lot of the features that addons bring over the new default that a lot would just want a smaller addon that just maybe makes up the difference which I'm sure will be in development. to be "stock" but extra features.
[4:54:14] A_DogTheKing: @undefeated888 W honestly
[4:54:20] undefeated888: thats a steal deal right
[4:54:35] f1nnfin: Clap2
[4:54:37] A_DogTheKing: yeah kinda expensive for 16 gb so
[4:54:43] undefeated888: @a_dogtheking yesss nice I knew ill go ahead with it
[4:54:45] KeennyB: The buff bars how he change them so big , and his namebar an stuff
[4:54:50] asbolution_: @Avinar dont disagree with you, its great for that demographic
[4:54:55] xhairbait: dat music beat doh
[4:54:57] Paselo: @KeennyB addon plater
[4:54:57] einfachwambo: @undefeated888 cap cuz of laptop
[4:54:59] undefeated888: @a_dogtheking laptop though
[4:54:59] JoelGusto: @undefeated888 I can link you the one I ordered, half price with a 3050 16gb
[4:55:33] Avinar: yeah, I think of it like apple vs android lmao. default UI will have enough customization it will be OK enough , and android, or addons, will be for the extra features and QoL lmao
[4:55:37] clipchampion: PauseChamp hold...
[4:55:46] asbolution_: @KeennyB its masque, with a lib addon that lety you apply masque to hotbars, bags, buff icons etc.

[5:19:05] RagnaroekIV: @teamthunder_ They are mostly Buffs that hold for 30-60 Minutes, so he doesnt need to activate them all the time, or situational stuff. Like do Cleanse someone from a Debuff, or Stun a target to make it easier

[6:21:40] Roonab: eh
[6:21:49] MrPink604: new world sold hella units
[6:21:52] sklingel: 2 week success you mean
[6:21:57] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[6:21:58] LeviathanQT: @Rectiphly no man, theres point to check out game that had no idea how to cater to the MMO community. insanely grindy systems with no end game
[6:22:00] iOwnLegacy: New world was repetitive
[6:22:01] CodeCrisp: yeah3+
[6:22:04] Roonab: financial success != success
[6:22:05] tompstoneg: @Rectiphly I mean its not finished with just 1 raid right?
[6:22:06] asbolution_: nah meming aside they absolutely were successful, diablo immortal not an MMO, but also a success.
[6:22:06] Jessy_Bonsai: True.
[6:22:07] CodeCrisp: success is capital unfortunately for us gamers
[6:22:12] zayoth: zayoth subscribed with Prime. 
[6:22:14] alsodellor: shitty way to measure success
[6:22:16] LeviathanQT: @Rectiphly its literally disrespectful of my time to play that game
[6:22:18] vs_rus: is this ascension classless?
[6:22:20] Woodled: @Rampent10 agreed
[6:22:26] vacui_dev: for a company like amazon, you have to ask if they made more money than they would have made spending that same money on something else
[6:22:28] Ennibrattr: $4 and a Twinkie
[6:22:29] asbolution_: success / good very different things sadly
[6:22:31] tompstoneg: @Rectiphly I liked the game I have 400hours on it and I will play fresh again but cmon dude not even 1 raid at the start was a huge fuck up
[6:22:31] cheeseburgxx: tarkov
[6:22:35] cheeseburgxx: milked the tity
[6:22:38] bipp93: servers died in EU now fml
[6:22:38] Pandar12: only money matters gamers
[6:22:38] webster0990: @louiswut truth. look at Madden. yearly 60$ roster updates. not to mention the p2w addons.
[6:22:39] notColt45: Success !== twitch views
[6:22:39] Rectiphly: i agree
[6:22:40] bleadz: @vs_rus that game is great
[6:22:41] cptaizensosuke: but milkin the cow on decade like wow is DUB! @shroud
[6:22:43] chillyl0l: why does everyone play classic instead?
[6:22:43] hate_xyz: New World was amazon's first success which is pretty cool
[6:22:45] vacui_dev: sure they doubled their cost, but could they have tripled their cost if they put those engineers on something else
[6:22:46] Rectiphly: im not saying that youre all not right
[6:22:46] Rhie: "success" means they made profit. how well the game last is all depends on the publisher from their on
[6:22:55] k3too: for the companies...
[6:22:58] CodeCrisp: if u are watching ads in your game, you are paying the price
[6:22:58] VanidarD: the riot MMO will be insanely successful, question is, will it be good?
[6:22:58] Rectiphly: im just saying the game in the last month has gotten so much better
[6:23:05] kodiakzilla33: When are you gonna make your own game @shroud
[6:23:06] Death_Dono: PepeLaugh WotLK classic cost = $0 and still making money Kappa
[6:23:08] vs_rus: @bleadz ikr but still needs some balancing on some builds AHAHAHAHAHA
[6:23:13] Syon_: @bipp93 No they didn't. It's scheduled maintenance.
[6:23:18] fixiOnNor: u ever played elder scrolls online?
[6:23:23] BigBoomed: @VanidarD I would bet my left and right nut that its gunna be good
[6:23:23] Jessy_Bonsai: IDK I think the RIOT MMO is gonna do nuts because it's gonna have PvE element to it and that's something alot of people who suck at PvP have been wanting.
[6:23:30] asbolution_: Idk if RIOT mmo will be good. What I can say 100% is they are in a better position than most to make something good.
[6:23:31] itsquetzy: theres only going to be ques on tuesdays thats how many ppl are raid logging already
[6:23:35] ChippotleTTV: catJAM

[6:23:51] webster0990: Are you the main tank? @shroud
[6:23:51] Rectiphly: but imo rift was the best mmo ever launched
[6:23:53] LeviathanQT: its literally sad they took this long and the game desrves to die
[6:23:57] DJKmanTV: Here we go....I wanna be like shroud and Prot Pally Tank. I miss this workflow post work. Good Times..

[6:24:41] anciano_del_sur: adblock?
[6:24:42] asbolution_: like riot has money and bodies, theres no reason their MMO doesnt have a good chance.

[6:24:50] VaranVids: What is Twitch Adblocker for $200 Shroud

[6:27:25] premiumtasty: Hello Shroud, how are you? What's your GS already?
[6:27:26] Nasz___: eventually it will just be a part of gaming?
[6:27:28] Syon_: @imhadeen OMEGALUL
[6:27:33] sklingel: tested it on new world's 3k viewers
[6:27:33] Vazini: but does the player sees those adds?
[6:27:36] TheCacman: TheCacman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[6:27:36] stabbedineye: Nice new world scam. ! great stuff
[6:27:38] hooomanoid: We live in a toxic world
[6:27:39] Ashamintallu: that's just what we need, more fucking ads
[6:27:41] Vazini: ah ok
[6:27:41] RoyceRemix: ohhh
[6:27:43] zev319: oh that's fine, hope they'd let u customize it if that's the case
[6:27:49] nochillcollin: @shroud would this be in place of the video ads that nonsubs get?
[6:27:51] bengalbroys: If there's a way for subs to not see the ads then there'll be a way for ad blockers to block them LUL
[6:27:54] Vazini: so iots like soccer adds in world cup
[6:27:56] joe_kerr78: My immersion tho
[6:27:57] Rectiphly: for example. shrouds feed gets directed to an ai based server that then redirects it back to twitch but there will be in game banners
[6:27:59] FuWeii: its actually better because you dont get removed from the stream
[6:28:01] PR1NCEVE6ETA: whats that addon for enemy hp bars
[6:28:04] trumaNr: that sounds like shit from a viewers perspective
[6:28:06] hate_xyz: #ad
[6:28:06] Vazini: the bilboards are localized
[6:28:07] Rectiphly: but the banners are only there for the viewers
[6:28:12] Greg4144: Booo
[6:28:15] colonelbleezy: in da future my butthole will have a butthole
[6:28:15] Rectiphly: not actually in the game
[6:28:15] quazzziiimotttooo: no....
[6:28:21] nemex: sounds like cancer
[6:28:23] Horse3000: i dont want to see ads in a game
[6:28:26] Robhertz3174: nah thats a worse experience for the viewer ngl
[6:28:26] Shiggityy: yeeaaaaa
[6:28:26] colonelbleezy: and there will be ads there also
[6:28:26] thePunkMonk: sounds great... then we dont have to pay attention to it
[6:28:27] Ashamintallu: better experience would be no shit ads
[6:28:27] Rectiphly: ive had my hand in designing this
[6:28:27] thask_: um no ?
[6:28:29] sesh_dg: Would rather it just be on a strimmer greenscreen
[6:28:30] LeviathanQT: na this is bad for gaming
[6:28:30] Shiggityy: siq
[6:28:32] ItsSpy: Its only for people watching the stream, not for the streamer and not people playing games chat LUL
[6:28:34] blablaxd: as long as my ad block still works :)
[6:28:35] thask_: fuck that lmfao
[6:28:35] Scooterdashooter: Promote?
[6:28:36] MassiveCollapse: Nah sorry shit take keep ads out of games
[6:28:38] Coluejack: all the pillars are going to look like red bulls hahaha gross
[6:28:38] Apyrexia_: RIP adblock?
[6:28:38] Drewskee_: @shroud my bad I thought you meant in game for even non streaming
[6:28:41] PR1NCEVE6ETA: whats that addon for enemy hp bars?
[6:28:44] LeviathanQT: your talking about the idealized version of this, will be terrible long term
[6:28:45] hate_xyz: it sounds really cool because you won't have your viewing experience interrupted
[6:28:45] quazzziiimotttooo: full screens gunna look like a virus in game...
[6:28:46] asbolution_: chat, at least you'll be seeing 100% of content how is this not better
[6:28:46] Ledjinn87: @shroud WTH realms are still down
[6:28:49] HolyAshe54: What if you’re subbed
[6:28:49] dorito_mcnugget: KEKW
[6:28:49] Rectiphly: adblock on twitch doesnt work anyway wtf
[6:28:50] Smojo1: sounds like a great idea tbh
[6:28:51] sekrettto: But mu immersion!!
[6:28:53] asbolution_: explain how this is not better chat LUL
[6:28:54] I__Need__Jesus: What about immersive streams where you're invested in the game world
[6:28:55] thask_: streamer take
[6:28:57] clancylegit: i think i would prefer that rather than waiting 30sec
[6:29:02] hate_xyz: full screen ads make you miss the action
[6:29:03] TheRagingUnicorn: @PR1NCEVE6ETA no idea but stop spamming please
[6:29:07] zev319: adblock works fine on twitch, u just need the correct ones
[6:29:09] thePunkMonk: @Rectiphly it does but you dont know how to make it work
[6:29:10] sidster033: @ItsSpy if this is the case, i revoke my undope. Honestly to integrate it with gaming ONLY during stream sounds like a good move, but if the average gamer playing that game is bombarded by ads IN GAME that would be awful
[6:29:11] ggilgamech: people want everything to be free LOL this chat
[6:29:12] xThatWhiteKid: cant wait to have ads stuffed down my throat in game too
[6:29:13] Rectiphly: u just get a purple screen instead of the add whats the benefit
[6:29:13] Lovablethug: !lvl
[6:29:14] montereyy: where i can see his build ?
[6:29:18] trumaNr: @Rectiphly plenty of other options that still work
[6:29:20] The_Mail_Man__: @PR1NCEVE6ETA Shadowed Unitframes
[6:29:24] Lovablethug: is he playing wotlk or DF?
[6:29:27] ABSOLUTESLIM: imagine all games are f2p with a bunch of ads
[6:29:31] Scottter: !crosshair
[6:29:31] StreamElements: @izzskat He changes this a LOT - (Updated Sept 23rd) Color: Cyan | Inner lines: 1/12/4/5 - https://clips.twitch.tv/SuccessfulBoxyShallotPunchTrees-1wu599OpJqxzmd3m
[6:29:44] Rectiphly: well anyway i got a chance to peak at the tech and its SUPER cool
[6:29:48] ItsSpy: @ItsSpy Yes its not actually in the game, think of it as a hologram but only a hologram that viewers of the stream see
[6:29:55] hate_xyz: guild drama! ooh
[6:29:56] HomemadeGrenade: clearly if this is the case, devs choose whether to build it into their world. makes sense in games like Valorant or OW2, and clearly the DayZ devs arent going to implement something like that
[6:30:04] mohohorde: lol when u get icc stuff this will get oneshoted xD
[6:30:10] Rectiphly: its not built into the world @HomemadeGrenade
[6:30:19] lexissswag13: i prefer watching an 30 secs ad than watching gameplay and just seeing random ads like that would be so distracting and bad looking
[6:30:20] sidster033: @ItsSpy i formally retract my undope. probably makes the stream more enjoyable long term
[6:30:23] Rectiphly: its basically an overlay
[6:30:38] imhadeen: @lexissswag13 same
[6:30:40] ggilgamech: @lexissswag13 go on then lol
[6:30:54] asbolution_: like ads + content vs ads + no content. Kind of a no brainer
[6:30:58] soClutchItHurts: leave
[6:30:58] gh0t: NOOO
[6:31:00] HomemadeGrenade: @Rectiphly oh i see. well then it comes down to knowing which games to use it on and what experiences arent conducive to it
[6:31:09] thePunkMonk: its just advanced overlays
[6:31:18] ItsSpy: @ItsSpy Seems like a really good solution to the ad problem, i imagine subbing would opt you out of seeing them. Time will tell ig
[6:31:23] gabrielpatty: shroud house looks really nice
[6:31:26] LeGahSee: retail or classic?
[6:31:27] ut_gohan: shinji9Dance
[6:31:27] zev319: anything is probably better than the old tv style ad system
[6:31:28] Rectiphly: i wish i couldve done more on the project but im far too busy in my own buisness to work on tech that requires that much attention but from what ive seen under the hood this is like really really big and imo a much more seamless viewing experience
[6:31:36] Malchezar_BCL: !elvui
[6:31:38] sesh_dg: Starbucks adds in icc
[6:31:40] Apyrexia_: @shroud Sorry your cast bar is 1MM off to the left and it triggers my OCD!!
[6:31:46] Nasz___: seems like a gate way to implement ads into actual gaming ngl
[6:31:51] lieuminate: It's like what baseball currently does on the backstop behind the pitcher
[6:31:52] LeviathanQT: its going to start small and unintrusive.. for sure. get people okay with it
[6:31:53] torradinhas97: Destroys the environment of the game ads on banners wtf
[6:31:55] lieuminate: *cather
[6:31:55] nemex: the chance every advertiser makes bespoke ads to blend into every game is 0%
[6:31:57] asbolution_: i just want raid shadowlegends ads in every mmo / rpg KEKW
[6:32:00] hate_xyz: tbh, i would rather see uninterrupted gameplay with an ad in the background instead
[6:32:01] stikfigure77: honestly sounds like kill leader banner in apex like your running around and see someones card
[6:32:01] montereyy: @shroud can i see your build pls ? <3
[6:32:02] Rectiphly: they arent like everywhere chat
[6:32:06] bengalbroys: @ItsSpy if its just an overlay it would be easier to block anyway
[6:32:08] Rectiphly: they just pop up from time to time
[6:32:08] RoyceRemix: So is this proposed as a replacement to twitch's integrated ads? Or something additional?
[6:32:12] LeviathanQT: pretty soon it will absolute cancer though right...
[6:32:24] Rectiphly: its a replacement @RoyceRemix
[6:32:28] StreamElements: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[6:32:42] HomemadeGrenade: lol everyone losing their shit when they will hardly notice it
[6:32:46] Yliwos: wow looks so different
[6:32:53] ChubbyMikey: PUBG been doing that for years
[6:32:57] ItsSpy: @bengalbroys Idk if its as simple as a "overlay"
[6:33:00] flashnickgg: NOTED
[6:33:01] sgHeat: that's where it starts. It'll get way worse.
[6:33:02] CodeCrisp: return to amsterdam
[6:33:03] weightmaker: all viewers will see that ad though?
[6:33:05] ab0m22: subliminal
[6:33:07] bengalbroys: @ItsSpy he just said it was
[6:33:07] bye_acc: Don't feel like people get how convenient it would actually be to have ads on fly rather than pausing the whole thing
[6:33:08] hate_xyz: that's pretty nice
[6:33:10] parthinias: thats awesome
[6:33:11] paiq: so its like banner irl
[6:33:12] colonelbleezy: MOUNTAIN DEW
[6:33:13] RoyceRemix: ok that's kinda neat
[6:33:16] HarleyAshton: HarleyAshton subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! washed
[6:33:17] ioRio: ruins immersion
[6:33:20] thePunkMonk: its advanced overlays
[6:33:21] clancylegit: it's doope
[6:33:24] torradinhas97: ah thats cool
[6:33:24] CodeCrisp: nike ad lmaoo
[6:33:28] Xper1enC: This would break the immersion of the game
[6:33:29] Shiggityy: siq
[6:33:29] zev319: if that said onlyfans
[6:33:30] torradinhas97: thats cool actually
[6:33:31] JayOle: amazon always lookin to get paid
[6:33:31] GreenEagleActual: i didnt see it untily ou pointed it out
[6:33:35] Mick8205: @shroud i mean of course they will show a small little ad but it will grow and also it takes you out of the fantasy aspect of the game
[6:33:35] coldfyrre: its better but it still sucks
[6:33:35] Rectiphly: this took literally years to develop too
[6:33:36] lnterSolar: just sub 4Head
[6:33:36] insano_4: subliminal. i dont like what they are doing to my sub conscious. i vote no
[6:33:37] TheKingCaveman: booo
[6:33:37] boraq: thats how it begins. its the end. ads everywhere
[6:33:39] eamm_: Aware
[6:33:40] asbolution_: imagine if it said raid shadowlegends KEKW
[6:33:40] ItsSpy: Pretty sure the streamer doesnt even see those either
[6:33:41] SuperSkunkFunk: fuck thatr
[6:33:41] emilbxd: that is not bad
[6:33:41] flashnickgg: PauseChamp shroud only fans
[6:33:41] shokka__tv: you dont plkay games to  seee that though
[6:33:43] deathygg: in-game billboards lol
[6:33:43] TheRagingUnicorn: @MassiveCollapse nobody cares
[6:33:44] fearandthompson: actually awful
[6:33:44] JayOle: the need to keep the game alive somehow
[6:33:45] lilith_belskaia: Is this an extension so it's not actually *in* the game?
[6:33:46] ab0m22: subliminal messaging to brain wash us
[6:33:49] SuperSkunkFunk: thats trash tbh
[6:33:50] Shiggityy: win win win
[6:33:50] cwispywispy: Wtf happened to World of Warcraft bro
[6:33:52] shagobad: Are we not playing video games to escape the places we walk around and see bilboards lol
[6:33:52] mynameisArimus: ads are beating us to the metaverse
[6:33:53] weeezzable: kind of immersion breaking to be honest
[6:33:55] cwispywispy: LOOOL
[6:33:57] UhhAndrew: didn't pubg have something like that for gaming orgs?
[6:33:57] Rectiphly: its not actually in the game
[6:33:59] CodeCrisp: imagine an entire game of just ads everywhere
[6:33:59] Indefect: !subs
[6:33:59] StreamElements: @indefect, his sub count is at least 1 shroudKEK
[6:34:01] Rectiphly: its just an overlay
[6:34:01] Jballz94: as long as the aesthetics fit i dont see a reason to complain
[6:34:07] ok_karma: Players playing the game dont see the ads
[6:34:09] NeekNap: @shokka__tv You arent playinh are you?
[6:34:09] Zoric33: thats horrible for the love of god please never do that
[6:34:09] KacperDeGhost: Ruins imersion
[6:34:11] asbolution_: how is it more immersion breaking than a full screen of adds for 3 mins chat cmon
[6:34:12] L1quidkurage496: Along as they dont bombard
[6:34:13] ok_karma: its only on the strea
[6:34:13] insano_4: subliminal. i dont like what they are doing to my sub conscious. i vote no
[6:34:15] hate_xyz: i would rather have that instead of a fullscreen ad
[6:34:15] HomemadeGrenade: let the people stream and make a living, for god sake chat
[6:34:16] 산카__: people are so rude damn chill out chat
[6:34:17] vevn11: ads on arena walls in wow
[6:34:18] TheRagingUnicorn: ill help you out brother MassiveCollapse
[6:34:19] Luskilla: @shroud kinda smart considering most people as soon as they get hit with an ad they click off stream
[6:34:21] Zeraos: Will you play fresh New World?
[6:34:22] imhadeen: ima bout to start reading books off of this tech
[6:34:25] itsquetzy: its going to be like Times Square with ads every where you look
[6:34:29] SirYoloSwag54: yo guys if you wan immersion, play the game yourselves you ballsacks
[6:34:29] Grawbad: Oh yay, now I can see adds in games through streamers.  Love it.  Can't wait to see Taco Bell plastered all over stormwind.
[6:34:34] BobbyHillsThighMust: Corpa yes purchase more things
[6:34:38] Rectiphly: yes @shroud you basically stream to their server and they redirect it back to your twitch channel
[6:34:39] Apyrexia_: Dalaran gonna be twitchcon
[6:34:40] ThiefXLFT: hot singles in your area!
[6:34:40] NeekNap: @siryoloswag54 Fax
[6:34:41] SuperSkunkFunk: if its ONLY on atream thats fine, NOT in regular game tho
[6:34:42] trumaNr: thats trash from an immersion standpoint though, imagine seeing a toyota ad in your next witcher game
[6:34:44] hate_xyz: no more 0/8 ads
[6:34:52] hate_xyz: 1/8*
[6:34:52] ticktrip: cant the game developer sue saying it misrepresents their game?
[6:34:57] Syon_: Smooth OMEGALUL
[6:34:58] taels_: so basically its old school 2014 EA Games BF2142 ingame ad placement except just for streamers...
[6:35:03] SadgeSidney: You're telling me... You want to fix what twitch is doing with it's insane adsense? lmao
[6:35:04] imdruuunk: twitch is already full of ads
[6:35:08] Rectiphly: guys its only seen by viewers on twitch
[6:35:10] SirYoloSwag54: this is for streamers and ads, not in the games you play guys lol
[6:35:12] JayOle: it will boil down to who OWNS the game to determine the ads
[6:35:14] alsodellor: how will they work for streamers with capture cards aka dual pc streaming
[6:35:14] Kaz0w: @trumaNr he is talkin abt if u watch streamers, not ur personal game experience
[6:35:15] FlawlessStevy: lame
[6:35:16] zev319: what if u had some sort of exclusivity clause with another company tho thats a rival company vs the ads that the game is showing? how would that work
[6:35:20] Morchiba_: Aware its in my dreams now
[6:35:24] NaDaDoctor: OR Pizza Hut!
[6:35:28] StickLook49: valorant ads on cs
[6:35:32] skympii: we all know americans love to complain KEKW
[6:35:32] Xper1enC: @Xper1enC I understand but at least from my point of view it would ruin the experience. The way it's done now is better as it's usually just a small box in the corner or something similar that can be ignored.
[6:35:33] asbolution_: chat omg its not actually in game they cant literally force ads into the game thats not...
[6:35:35] asbolution_: u guys lol
[6:35:37] TheRagingUnicorn: chat is braindead holy
[6:35:38] ItsSpy: Chat doesn't read LUL
[6:35:39] TheRagingUnicorn: KEKW

[6:35:42] bengalbroys: LULW
[6:35:44] kewpsa: sounds awesome chat are being weird AF
[6:35:46] Reptile_FPS: Like futurama ads in your dreams
[6:35:49] thePunkMonk: @hildyboy its not more ads... its different ads
[6:35:50] MadlifeElements: chat Being Pepega
[6:35:50] DefSoul0601: iitzHi gsssHi
[6:35:53] Ver0th: They are just trying to bypass adblock
[6:35:54] asbolution_: @TheRagingUnicorn I cant KEKW
[6:35:55] bw1m: buncha mouth breathers
[6:35:55] ggilgamech: oh nooo my immersion.. lol this chat
[6:35:55] ItsSpy: KEKW
[6:35:57] ChubbyMikey: C'mon man, chat is dumb. You KNEW this
[6:36:01] lnterSolar: Pepega Clap
[6:36:01] cjh_tv: its simply for chat viewers
[6:36:04] SkullFullghOST: LUL
[6:36:04] Ledjinn87: @shroud Welp we got a extra hour added so 7PM PDT 9PM Central
[6:36:07] Kspremz: what addons are u using?
[6:36:07] Breikon: Thats bad
[6:36:08] Moulun77: i think its a great idea
[6:36:08] Rectiphly: the immersion of watching a streamer play a game
[6:36:10] TheRagingUnicorn: @ins_space welcome to my DAILY life in this channel
[6:36:10] JayOle: i thought it was in game overlay
[6:36:10] hate_xyz: Chatting
[6:36:11] deathygg: What about subs ?
[6:36:12] FlawlessStevy: sounds Terrible
[6:36:12] riskitt_fps: chats full of dummies tonight ha
[6:36:13] Flooodles: sounds bad
[6:36:13] eamm_: I CANT PLAY NOW Madge
[6:36:14] Leviokz: that people dont understand this is really crazy KEKW
[6:36:14] Skipy129: chat thought there was ads in game
[6:36:15] skympii: people are so dumb KEKW
[6:36:17] lilith_belskaia: It's definitely an interesting idea, I'll give them that.
[6:36:17] HanScrub: is this classic?
[6:36:17] HomemadeGrenade: THIS IS AMAZING THIS IS GOOD
[6:36:18] ioRio: so a less invasive banner
[6:36:18] JayOle: which will proobaly happen sooon
[6:36:19] flashnickgg: NODDERS
[6:36:20] alsodellor: gonna force streamers to single pc stream :(
[6:36:20] MatTheBrat: are they going to throw both ads at us? like ads in game and ads that fully disrupt the stream?
[6:36:21] BobbyHillsThighMust: if i cant adblock it, i dont like it :) smile
[6:36:21] Rectiphly: when most of yall dont even watch you just listen to the background LOL
[6:36:23] ABSOLUTESLIM: isnt it up to the game developers to profit of ads in their games
[6:36:23] insano_4: @Rectiphly LOL
[6:36:23] thePunkMonk: @hildyboy too bad... its already here and ur already putting up with it.. get over it
[6:36:23] kenapa1234: muh immersion
[6:36:23] Death_Dono: yeah i like that
[6:36:25] Hulknasty: def a good thing
[6:36:28] asbolution_: @TheRagingUnicorn explains why you're a raging unicon and not a calm one Kappa
[6:36:30] dunsefar: Like you arent making enough money KEKW
[6:36:31] Kaz0w: EUW Maintenance is rip
[6:36:33] Ledjinn87: will all this time adding they need to go ahead and give us the primal storm event instead of waiting til the 15th
[6:36:33] Hulknasty: but could become bad lol
[6:36:33] ItsSpy: Madge How dare those streamers make a living
[6:36:37] poggersized: pretty cool, will you still be able to control what ads are overlayed though?
[6:36:37] PaNeKed: That's a really cool way to build ad revenue. I dig it.
[6:36:37] colonelbleezy: you could put big donger images everywhere!
[6:36:38] zev319: what if u had some sort of exclusivity clause with another company tho thats a rival company vs the ads that the game is showing? how do you think that would work @shroud
[6:36:39] Moulun77: its like hockey games right now. the boards now show a version on tv that no one sees in person
[6:36:41] hate_xyz: it would work nice in Valorant
[6:36:45] TheRagingUnicorn: @ins_space boy howdy i wonder why... LOOL
[6:36:46] Grawbad: Will it be in recordings of your stream?  I sure hope not.  Because then were are going to have game videos on Youtube where we see Taco Bell in all the areas of a game.
[6:36:50] thePunkMonk: chats too dumb to get the concept LUL
[6:36:51] Moulun77: increasing revenue, making the players get more money
[6:36:55] bwade87: gg
[6:36:57] Xufa: anyone who thinks thats worse than 8 unskippable 30 second ads as soon as you click on a stream is an adblock user lol
[6:36:57] CoffeeCupsTV: @shroud 5D advertising.  Free Skins of advertisignments.  Mounts... lol
[6:36:57] Rectiphly: guys its basically just streaming to a different service
[6:37:00] vacui_dev: I like it only if chat can bid to also decide what ads go up in your game. Make the addys pay
[6:37:02] cjh_tv: it just adds one extra port to where the content is sent
[6:37:06] Shiggityy: people don't like ads in general but it pays for so much of everything
[6:37:06] ChubbyMikey: okay, done with that guy
[6:37:06] Rectiphly: instead of streamer streaming directly to twitch
[6:37:17] TheRagingUnicorn: fair mikey
[6:37:17] HanScrub: is this wow classic chat
[6:37:18] alsodellor: as long as an overlay can somehow work while streaming with a capture card and not direct capture
[6:37:19] Yliwos: they already do it in baseball
[6:37:21] Rectiphly: they stream to the service and the service bounces it back to your channel
[6:37:27] ggilgamech: @HanScrub yea
[6:37:32] HanScrub: kk ty!
[6:37:33] Awnit: this becomes a dark timeline when they use it to target ads
[6:37:34] JayOle: an ad overlay is nothing new....
[6:37:36] sturdy_ladder: sturdy_ladder subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[6:37:36] vacui_dev: actually why don't you already have an overlay where people can bid on how much they pay for what ad shows up there
[6:37:38] Rectiphly: the ads are not seen by anyone else other than the viewers of the stream
[6:37:39] ItsSpy: very fair solution to the ad issues imo
[6:37:43] Cptbeetrootface: Any interest in going back to new world?
[6:37:46] TheRagingUnicorn: you dont agree with it because you dont understand it
[6:37:47] joshface2: It makes me uncomfortable,  don't know why.
[6:37:47] flashnickgg: instead give plebs 5 ads overlay better experience NODDERS
[6:37:48] TheRagingUnicorn: period end of story
[6:37:49] Rectiphly: @kleleu89 yes it should
[6:37:49] TheRagingUnicorn: LOL
[6:37:49] asbolution_: @TheRagingUnicorn tbf I deal with patients all day and we're trying harder to provide health education. I empathise with you LUL
[6:37:51] Alaziara: I hate ads Madge
[6:37:53] BlueberryPie_69: That's actually great for subliminal messaging. I love thsi!
[6:37:54] Shiggityy: yup
[6:37:55] bengalbroys: its something new, people don't like change and then it happens and they get used to it
[6:37:57] smiltstomb: Honestly a much better way to have ads
[6:37:57] notColt45: If it works well, it can help live content
[6:37:58] Teopolis: And it's streaming through someone else's hardware?
[6:37:58] GreenEagleActual: it would def be in the vod
[6:37:58] hate_xyz: Adge
[6:38:02] Fultis: except the devs that get there game tarnished by a logitech logo
[6:38:03] TheRagingUnicorn: @ins_space KEKW
[6:38:07] Geneticks: @dunsefar what that as to do with anything he's saying? it's just a different way to present adds without disrupting you from watching content. Damn Pepega
[6:38:08] Death_Dono: PepeLaugh future ads 1 min
[6:38:08] KingCiolan: sounds like something an ad pusher would say KEKW
[6:38:09] ioRio: doesnt that allow longer ad exposure
[6:38:13] botchiee: are u gonna play retail?
[6:38:14] blablaxd: yeah but I can block those rolled ads
[6:38:16] Hollow111: but ma adblock wont work MYAAA
[6:38:16] Hrufall: Less intrusive adds would be good
[6:38:17] fearandthompson: but we know it would never replace the normal sets of ads
[6:38:17] Syon_: I'm just going to close my eyes so I don't see them 4Head
[6:38:19] zev319: iw ould be fine with it, the only reason i block ads is because it prevents me from watching what i want to watch
[6:38:20] psyntaur: organic aids all the way
[6:38:23] Leviokz: this is waaaaaay better then watching 2,3,4 ads with no gameplay between them KEKW
[6:38:23] fearandthompson: you would just have both
[6:38:25] boraq: it begins with small ads, then its full-blown annoying ads. the end is upon us boiis. FeelsBadMan
[6:38:26] boolaga: They still need to give viewers a better way to control how they view ads so it's not disruptive to the viewing experience.
[6:38:26] HomemadeGrenade: so many times i have missed action i waited hours for because of an ad break. ill take this any day
[6:38:27] TheRagingUnicorn: CHAT just close your eyes you wont see shit
[6:38:27] Kyrioz: whats an add pepeD KEKW
[6:38:28] Rectiphly: with the way ads are going now streamers literally have to plan their stream around ad rolls
[6:38:28] nemex: it's not that it's not interesting, it's that there won't be bespoke ads created for every game which will make them clash and stand out often, and most streamers will max it out on top of rolling hourly ads
[6:38:30] StaggRealm: I like the idea because I can still listen to the streamer with the new tech
[6:38:32] DrBogart420: what if you're subbed, would they still show up? :)
[6:38:32] TheRagingUnicorn: PepeLaugh
[6:38:33] Rectiphly: which is awful
[6:38:33] GreenEagleActual: bet
[6:38:38] kenapa1234: Madge
[6:38:39] Grawbad: THey do this in Sports.  Like when you watch a Hockey game the ice has adds out near the blue line.  Used to be on the glass and people hated it so they moved it to the ice.
[6:38:42] wesudesuu: @ins_space @ins_space That's if theyre receptive to learning to begin with LOL
[6:38:45] shadeonyourlife: we'll just update the block lol
[6:38:48] flashnickgg: @TheRagingUnicorn but i can see you mod PeepoWeird
[6:38:48] thePunkMonk: viewers still have the choice of watching the content
[6:38:50] weeezzable: someone will inevitably build an adblock for it
[6:38:51] SteeeeelReign: rich and delusional
[6:38:57] asbolution_: ad block wont work yet we'll find a way Kappa
[6:38:58] TheRagingUnicorn: @flashnickgg its unfortunate to see that huh KEKW
[6:38:58] ItsSpy: Jebaited
[6:39:01] boraq: Retail up
[6:39:03] sesh_dg: if it replaces 30s adds then yes, its good. If it replaces an overlay icon, then no
[6:39:04] LostOneKWX: LostOneKWX subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! What’s good bro!? 💯💯💯
[6:39:05] Rectiphly: @shroud it will they already figured that out
[6:39:06] zev319: u just roll it
[6:39:07] snoopyd: turbo?
[6:39:08] notColt45: monkaHmm
[6:39:09] L1quidkurage496: They should let us rate them
[6:39:09] TheRagingUnicorn: ur stupid pls stop stabbedineye
[6:39:12] StaggRealm: if ur subbed do u still see the ads??
[6:39:12] Anubzara: Thank god? Oooof some people are out of touch
[6:39:16] kewpsa: dont tell chat they will looser thier mind again
[6:39:17] pyquilius: through the power of raspberry pi, my adblock will always work
[6:39:19] Vericxx: wtf since when does shroud play wow
[6:39:20] Alaziara: Mike is about to bombard us with ads
[6:39:22] alsodellor: pay the streamer to conveniently afk in front of the ads
[6:39:26] Rectiphly: @StaggRealm you shouldnt iirc
[6:39:29] asbolution_: @tsyakaz ye exactly, and when culture is involved man gl changing that monkaS
[6:39:31] boolaga: @stabbedineye If there's no money generated then the platform dies. When you're an adult you'll understand. LUL
[6:39:35] ImMaleeck: finally retail up
[6:39:36] GreenEagleActual: right now you would, yes
[6:39:37] joshface2: As a developer, I would hate to see the hard work I put into my game taken over by a different creative vision.
[6:39:38] zev319: what if u had some sort of exclusivity clause with another company tho thats a rival company vs the ads that the game is showing? how do you think that would work @shroud
[6:39:40] Endymini0n: funny to see new world ads in your warcraft of other way around
[6:39:41] tindersdown: you just dont stream on Twitch. Easy solution :)
[6:39:42] auto__attack: really ads should just show above chat.. @shroud
[6:39:42] Kyrioz: retail finally up
[6:39:45] chrondor: what classic server does Shroud play on?
[6:39:50] Alaziara: I heard you like ads, so I put ads in my ads
[6:39:51] boraq: Only T4 subs dont get ads.
[6:39:54] hungrybong01: Did you see the black adam?
[6:39:54] TheRagingUnicorn: @joshface2 this is an interesting take tho
[6:39:54] Rectiphly: @zev319 again the ads are not actually in the game
[6:39:56] HomemadeGrenade: @shroud play an ad break during boss fight, maybe chat will understand then
[6:39:58] SteeeeelReign: so youre saying put ads into games?
[6:39:58] Dotward54: I cant share it right now since the haters will sabotage me
[6:40:00] vevn11: so would this be a complement or a replacement?
[6:40:04] GreenEagleActual: LUL
[6:40:06] MatTheBrat: reatil wow up
[6:40:09] MatTheBrat: retail
[6:40:10] Death_Dono: it's a good option but i don't think it will work
[6:40:11] Garrett871: i can already see a giveaway in the ads and you have to find the code and enter it. which causes you to focus more on the ads
[6:40:13] TheRagingUnicorn: yeah and holy shit zev319 stop spamming
[6:40:15] StaggRealm: okay than I'm cool with it
[6:40:19] gramz: as long as twitch turbo still works, they can overload everyone else with a bunch of ads
[6:40:22] THERisenEclipse: sigh this chat
[6:40:24] asbolution_: hey, play raid shadow legends.
[6:40:28] GreenEagleActual: EZ Clap
[6:40:28] asbolution_: Kappa
[6:40:30] BryLion: why not just get a wacky inflatable tube man in the back ground
[6:40:36] Rectiphly: @zenzem1 should be a roplacement
[6:40:38] just9n: this is all good and well but when are you gonna play PUBG?
[6:40:42] Cori9432: why this guy is good at every game?
[6:40:46] TheRagingUnicorn: justin PLEASE
[6:40:47] BITCOlN: This is a great moment to tell you guys about Raid shadow legends
[6:40:48] yinniai: Stare
[6:40:48] joshface2: @TheRagingUnicorn it's one thing to have an overlay, it's not integrated into the game. Having something embedded into my work changes the whole dynamic of the vision of the game.
[6:40:49] ashkii_uwu: What're you gonna be doing rn @shroud ? waiting for players?
[6:40:49] TheRagingUnicorn: OMEGALUL
[6:40:54] zev319: so u get to choose what ads the game is showing? i would assume they would just show whatever they wanna show
[6:40:56] Jombinoo: turbo ftw
[6:40:58] kewpsa: LUL @just9n
[6:40:59] flashnickgg: @just9n WeirdChamp
[6:41:04] wesudesuu: @ins_space Oh yeah, I live in Florida as an ICU nurse, deal with this everytime I work.
[6:41:05] botchiee: EZ
[6:41:07] just9n: :)
[6:41:08] Luskilla: Idk how people are arguing this. Unless they really want to be slammed with 10 ads in a row
[6:41:09] GreenEagleActual: youll have to get more creative, it is not possible for generic rolled ads to not be blocked
[6:41:11] hate_xyz: shroud flexin on us LUL
[6:41:13] riskitt_fps: i think chat nees to stop bitching about ads
[6:41:13] Deadpan: roll ads plz
[6:41:15] sekrettto: We are disposable now? lol
[6:41:18] auto__attack: there's so much ad space that ISNT the video player itself. sucks
[6:41:18] TheRagingUnicorn: @joshface2 Yeah no I get that, I wasn't talking shit, your comment is the only one I've seen that is actually an interesting POV and not just braindead comments
[6:41:18] riskitt_fps: either sub or deal with ads
[6:41:20] riskitt_fps: plain and simple
[6:41:22] kidnxps: runs ads now
[6:41:26] Alaziara: LUL Justin when are they adding the new map back in rotation?
[6:41:28] StreamElements: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[6:41:29] asbolution_: @tsyakaz ever feel like you're smashing your face into a wall?
[6:41:31] THERisenEclipse: @TheRagingUnicorn i feel sorry for you having to be a mod for this chat
[6:41:33] views1k: just9nO
[6:41:35] ABSOLUTESLIM: game devs dont sue streamers for playing their game in front of thousands because it ads their game but they will definitely sue if streamers start profiting of random ads appearing on some house in the game
[6:41:35] ashkii_uwu: What are we waiting for?
[6:41:38] just9n: who cares LUL @Alaziara
[6:41:39] TheRagingUnicorn: @THERisenEclipse :)
[6:41:41] TradeMarkRose: Shroud calling us peasants again I love it 🥰
[6:41:41] soulsensii: but you do make money because of us
[6:41:42] HomemadeGrenade: @sekrettto no, your support is the reason he doesnt have to play ads lol
[6:41:45] thePunkMonk: so ur saying in the future you wont have to play the games you dont want to play and instead you will have ads in the games you want to play
[6:41:46] Alaziara: KEKW TRUE @just9n
[6:41:47] ashkii_uwu: Oh cool :D
[6:41:49] joshface2: @TheRagingUnicorn <3 thank you. I didn't take it as you talking shit. I just wanted to expand on my thought a bit. I appreciate you.
[6:41:55] StaggRealm: creators should be able to choose how and what ads they serve on their streams
[6:41:55] nemex: it's not that it's not interesting, it's that there won't be bespoke ads created for every game which will make them clash and stand out often, and most streamers will max it out on top of rolling hourly ads, lose/lose for viewers overall
[6:41:57] sesh_dg: Absolute madlad
[6:41:57] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[6:42:05] Cocainefiends: use adblock
[6:42:05] vacui_dev: Chat shut up for a second. I just have to say, my cat is absolutely adorable, and he's sleeping right now.
[6:42:11] sekrettto: @sekrettto Nice!
[6:42:12] ashkii_uwu: Which raid is up next?
[6:42:17] GreenEagleActual: @sekrettto that used to be the case, now every streamer Has to roll ads
[6:42:23] jackx3_: guys is it to late to start playing wow
[6:42:25] Focusbtw_TTV: Wow shroud playing WoW lets go!
[6:42:27] StreamElements: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[6:42:28] ItsSpy: KEKW
[6:42:32] kidnxps: @vacui_dev dogs are better lil bro
[6:42:36] Rectiphly: @nemex you either roll 4d ads or traditional ads not both
[6:42:38] clancylegit: @twoluvis2rage no
[6:42:38] auto__attack: ppl do use adblock, that's why they're trying other methods
[6:42:41] mrbubbastomper45: mrbubbastomper45 subscribed with Prime. 
[6:42:48] jackx3_: @twoluvis2rage say less
[6:42:49] mobbnBmobbn: @shroud so is new world out of the picture, will you ever play the game again?
[6:42:52] sabbaer6666: and if all do that?
[6:42:55] DjesusGung: !mods
[6:42:58] wesudesuu: Personally I dont see why people complain about ads. You're receiving a free experience of content. It really isnt that serious. 6 minutes of ads every hour isnt that big of a deal.
[6:42:59] nemex: when most streamers do it where do we turn to?
[6:43:02] views1k: @shroud do this IRL -> just9n3 just9n4
[6:43:05] lnterSolar: true
[6:43:05] trumaNr: do you own part of the company?
[6:43:06] hys1g: hey are you going to play DF when is comes out?
[6:43:06] TheRagingUnicorn: !classicaddons
[6:43:07] StreamElements: @TheRagingUnicorn, shroud uses SexyMap, Atlas, Bagnon, Details! Damage Meter, Dominos, LortiUI, Weak Auras, and TSM (TradeskillMaster). Font used: Prototype. Full list here: https://clips.twitch.tv/AuspiciousHedonisticBaconCharlieBitMe-lo617BXkDq7AIQCD - Updated 6/9/21
[6:43:11] flashnickgg: hasan will put ads on top of react video and put hourly ads
[6:43:11] Death_Dono: i did that on some streamers already KEKW
[6:43:14] mrbubbastomper45: or have prime then just dont get adds for free omg
[6:43:14] reallyeric: conservatives
[6:43:14] Rectiphly: guys the streamer will have to pick one or the other styles of ads
[6:43:21] Rectiphly: they wont be able to do both
[6:43:24] vastare: knee jerk reactions monkaS
[6:43:24] insano_4: B
[6:43:25] lnau: it's kind of like NFL/NBA vs. Soccer... soccer ads are superimposed on the field and on uniforms
[6:43:26] thePunkMonk: its new SwiftRage i hate it
[6:43:27] DJKmanTV: Panic! Panic! *sarcasm 100%
[6:43:27] eggsmasher: xD
[6:43:28] asbolution_: i doubt it will even be an option to do both
[6:43:28] ChubbyMikey: They hate businesses profiting in any way
[6:43:29] asbolution_: exactly
[6:43:30] bengalbroys: exactly what I said LULW people don't like change
[6:43:31] GreenEagleActual: i agree, that way of adding ads to a stream is creative and can be immersive. Way better than the trsh system they have now
[6:43:37] cambix: Next retail update is bouta be lit. Mage, priest, and rogue will be universal for all races now too.
[6:43:40] eggsmasher: @mrbubbastomper45 i still get ads and i am prime ?
[6:43:45] ashkii_uwu: Have you done naxx today?
[6:43:45] hate_xyz: baseball superimposes ads on the mound too
[6:43:47] RyuDAgnero: these Pepega chatters OMEGALUL
[6:43:50] xbandarrr: what is this game
[6:43:55] thePunkMonk: imagine people making money LUL
[6:44:00] auto__attack: just a selfish thing seems like
[6:44:03] DjesusGung: @TheRagingUnicorn I'm not sure if the one that displays EHP is in the list but I could be wrong
[6:44:06] sabbaer6666: well, there is good change and bad change
[6:44:08] TheRagingUnicorn: yo dont be a jerk thats my job and @ChubbyMikey's @JovanniOfRivia
[6:44:11] GreenEagleActual: YEP cock
[6:44:15] bnans: like fiber internet
[6:44:17] ChubbyMikey: My job
[6:44:19] TheRagingUnicorn: @DjesusGung probably not- its an outdated clip
[6:44:19] RawpicklesS: yeah ads are totally cool. that's why twitch viewership is hella down. totes
[6:44:20] bnans: remember dial up days sheesh
[6:44:21] yamachibe: like tarkov
[6:44:22] Fadaar: forgive me for not caring about the rich getting richer
[6:44:23] Rectiphly: guys this tech can be expanded upon in so many non advertisement ways
[6:44:24] MarkLeftBehind: iteration
[6:44:26] ChubbyMikey: other mods are the nice ones. I'm the dick
[6:44:26] AntVsEveryone: I dont think people are disowning the concept. Just the ads in general
[6:44:30] skympii: they hate getting taken advantage  yet their government fvk them everyday
[6:44:30] akd_bd: !subs
[6:44:31] StreamElements: @akd_bd, his sub count is at least 1 shroudKEK
[6:44:41] vacui_dev: Those advertisers are scammed, I don't watch the stream most of the time anyway, I just listen. Tell them to put in audio overlays
[6:44:43] krepskramsen: why no in game sound?
[6:44:43] Death_Dono: i don't hate ads, but 5min of it every 15min is too much i guess
[6:44:46] flashnickgg: NODDERS
[6:44:46] DIX5Y: except for the makers of fortnite they just totally ruined their idea lol
[6:44:48] phatlantis: @shroud twitch always making this new shit, but it gets canned Sadge
[6:44:48] DjesusGung: Sorry Shroud, what's the EHP mod you got on bottom left ?
[6:44:50] Rectiphly: ive done a bit of work with this kind of tech with what i do and trust me its going to be SO COOL
[6:44:52] TheRagingUnicorn: this has nothing to do with the rich getting richer Fadaar are u even listening lol
[6:44:55] vacui_dev: I want to hear every bullet shot modded to say "BUYCOKE"
[6:45:05] DJKmanTV: Marketing is powerful
[6:45:06] ItsSpy: Charity even
[6:45:08] Nasz___: why are you so defensive :x
[6:45:09] hate_xyz: NODDERS
[6:45:09] TheRagingUnicorn: @vacui_dev lmao
[6:45:13] asbolution_: like idk how to tell you man but the rich are gonna get richer regardless how is that comment even relevent
[6:45:20] sesh_dg: @DjesusGung Its a weakaura i think
[6:45:23] Dontslamcoke: HahaSweat
[6:45:26] amorluce: Some peopel jsut don't like ads
[6:45:33] Fadaar: @TheRagingUnicorn yep
[6:45:33] CraniumCrank: Billboards in GTA 6 are gonna look sick! lol
[6:45:34] okami_ttv: Ur mom?
[6:45:34] GreenEagleActual: @vacui_dev 5Head
[6:45:41] TheRagingUnicorn: @Cocainefiends the worst take ive seen so far

[6:45:45] someguycody: new rimworld dlc is S tier
[6:45:46] TheRagingUnicorn: OMEGALUL
[6:45:48] Helmzii: You full bis now ? or still lacking pieces ?
[6:45:50] Mr_Graybush: I think its such a cool damn idea. If its done right, it wouldnt be invasive at all. Especially compared to a 30 second add that cuts into the stream right when the action is happening lol. Done right it will meld into the game
[6:45:56] amorluce: Like when I just logged in to twitch I saw an ad
[6:46:17] hate_xyz: pepeJAM
[6:46:18] CraniumCrank: this guy lmao
[6:46:19] joshface2: @shroud as a developer, I would be concerned about that changing the aesthetic of the vision of my game. Only concern there.
[6:46:24] weightmaker: is 25m loot generally better than 10m?
[6:46:25] asbolution_: Its like some psychopath shit in half of chats cornflakes today I swear
[6:46:26] TheRagingUnicorn: Cocainefiends nah ur wild man
[6:46:31] eggsmasher: @weightmaker Yes
[6:46:31] Lilroy504: do you like that mount shroud?
[6:46:33] Senitality: ads will be a part of everything, it's how it goes. Might as well have them be less intrusive imo.
[6:46:38] HillaryTit: !addon

[6:46:48] TheRagingUnicorn: @joshface2 see, i told u that u had a good take <3

[6:47:03] lnterSolar: pokeScoots
[6:47:03] Rectiphly: just look at his name itll tell u all u need to know @ChubbyMikey
[6:47:06] TheRagingUnicorn: @CraniumCrank LOL
[6:47:13] loshietoshie: @Cocainefiends this guy seems edgey af...
[6:47:15] flashnickgg: how about ads on top of chat like banner but we can't chat monkaHmm
[6:47:17] asbolution_: will developers have a choice though really? If they need a publisher ultimately they'l have to agree no?
[6:47:17] vacui_dev: @joshface2 worst case would be paying shroud to play your new game to get people to see it, but the game is full of ad overlays, and people think that YOUR GAME is the one full of ads
[6:47:17] DaHoodyy: how cool can be any ad ? LUL
[6:47:18] TheRagingUnicorn: i didnt even realize the name lmfao
[6:47:20] Rectiphly: obviously a 12 year old
[6:47:21] xhairbait: how un-emersive though wtf
[6:47:25] DimmeTV: Chat, you're already walking ads with brands on clothing, headphones, phones etc etc
[6:47:27] joshface2: Augmenting into the world is a bit different than an overlay.
[6:47:32] CodeCrisp: imagine other games' ads in your game LULW
[6:47:36] Rectiphly: how as a viewer do u care about immersion
[6:47:40] xhairbait: in-game shit that makes no sense, is dumb... if it's like cyberpunk and it's an in-game banner, then cool.
[6:47:44] whataya_stoopid: devs will want a cut...
[6:47:44] hate_xyz: it's not changing their code or assets though
[6:47:47] CraniumCrank: @TheRagingUnicorn always gotta check the name KEKW
[6:47:48] ChubbyMikey: @Cocainefiends no, you moron. Go research, please.
[6:47:52] Hollow111: "what does it matter"? it's more like "why would we do it" for devs
[6:47:53] IanDooleyTV: Put ads in my game, I'm done gaming. I'm too old for that sort of pandering
[6:47:54] TheRagingUnicorn: yeah tbh the only pov that seems to matter is the one with the devs
[6:47:56] TheRagingUnicorn: gotta keep them happy
[6:48:01] FuWeii: its NOT in the game tho
[6:48:03] phinnian: would the devs have to share textures?
[6:48:06] amorluce: You buy a game and then you pay to see ads...
[6:48:07] sizzlorr: If it can be enable for streamers only, then Im all in for this
[6:48:08] asbolution_: seems more like a publisher decision than a developer one anyway
[6:48:10] DaHoodyy: we will have add block for games then
[6:48:10] eggsmasher: People be in here talking about how they dont like ads and shit . but they walk around with twitch and shroud merch already xD
[6:48:10] Rectiphly: @IanDooleyMusic they dont put the ads in the actual game
[6:48:11] DougTheApache: What are we talking about? ads for games within a game?
[6:48:16] lnterSolar: Pepega its not in your game chat
[6:48:16] AntVsEveryone: @IanDooleyMusic not in your game. in an overlay on a stream
[6:48:19] TheRagingUnicorn: Cocainefiends when all of chat is disagreeing with you, maybe take the L
[6:48:22] xhairbait: it would need to be themed for the game or something... maybe allow the developer to accept certain kinds of ads like that.
[6:48:25] wesudesuu: @Senitality Less intrusive to what? How do you want them less intrusive? Watching streamed content is literally free experience. There is really no justification to complain.
[6:48:26] DjesusGung: Sorry Shroud, what's the EHP mod you got on bottom left ? Is it Weakaura ?
[6:48:27] IanDooleyTV: @Rectiphly I just meant if games did have ads in AAA games.
[6:48:28] xhairbait: nah you whitelist it
[6:48:30] Snues: wait, maybe this whole talk is an ad Kappa
[6:48:33] cambix: Being okay with ads being put into a game will be the entry point of when they start using spyware to get better adsense when its put into everyones game.
[6:48:33] vacui_dev: @whataya_stoopid I dunno, if I see a content creator playing my game and making it look like the game itself is full of ads, I might send a DMCA on that, unless they have some overlay specifically saying that the ads are added by the streamer and not part of the game
[6:48:40] BubblePriest: streamers arent the only gamers too
[6:48:46] GreenEagleActual: @Rectiphly well say with the system of rolled ads now, you can be into someone gameplay happening and pre-rolls come out, boom, no longer immersed in the stream
[6:48:47] Rectiphly: @Rectiphly they will NEVER do that trust me
[6:48:48] cambix: you give companies an inch they'll take a mile
[6:48:50] ioRio: we already get banners embeded in our video feed along with audio only and regular ads
[6:49:02] hate_xyz: LUL
[6:49:02] xhairbait: some dating sim game
[6:49:03] Turtlee42: HUH
[6:49:04] k1s5: LUL
[6:49:04] meet21_: KEKW
[6:49:06] XplicitJim: when they're promoting loot boxes and gambling
[6:49:08] Rectiphly: guys adblocks dont even work on twitch
[6:49:08] Alaziara: HUH
[6:49:09] Yliwos: unless youre a hunter
[6:49:10] IanDooleyTV: @IanDooleyMusic Hmm, that's more acceptable, I guess. Still frustrating
[6:49:10] TheRagingUnicorn: alright go sit in the corner for a few minutes and come back
[6:49:11] flashnickgg: imagine seeing 2b assa in warcraft lobby HUH
[6:49:11] mr_zyan: HUH
[6:49:12] TheRagingUnicorn: KEKW
[6:49:14] CraniumCrank: I would say Cocainefields would die on this 'Blood money" rock but it would appear he had already smoked it
[6:49:15] GreenEagleActual: @Rectiphly Kapp
[6:49:16] Rectiphly: and anyone who says otherwise is lying
[6:49:19] Spetsmaz: make love not warcraft
[6:49:19] HillaryTit: !classicaddons
[6:49:19] StreamElements: @HillaryTit, shroud uses SexyMap, Atlas, Bagnon, Details! Damage Meter, Dominos, LortiUI, Weak Auras, and TSM (TradeskillMaster). Font used: Prototype. Full list here: https://clips.twitch.tv/AuspiciousHedonisticBaconCharlieBitMe-lo617BXkDq7AIQCD - Updated 6/9/21
[6:49:22] se_enginheiro: here cause euw servers down
[6:49:22] cambix: Just like the summit1g and monster energy thing..
[6:49:24] Rectiphly: you just get a purple screen instead of the ad
[6:49:25] DjesusGung: Thank you man @shroud
[6:49:26] MikeMeltz: U playing Gotham Knights tonihgt? @shroud
[6:49:28] bigvig8: its the same as having your face in the corner
[6:49:29] asbolution_: how much say will a developer have though vs a publisher in that choice?
[6:49:34] GreenEagleActual: @Rectiphly nope :)
[6:49:36] Smakberg: Every ad I see now I try not to buy the product because I’m so sick of ads
[6:49:41] wesudesuu: @Rectiphly @JamesonBlunts It's not that serious.
[6:49:46] 1skimp: for twitch firefox and UBlock works
[6:49:48] Rectiphly: @Rectiphly do u just get a purple screen during the ad?
[6:49:51] amorluce: I'm exactly thje same Smakerg
[6:49:53] joshface2: What if developers integrated the ad platform into their game during development? Mutual agreement, everyone wins!
[6:49:56] Lrg_46: Have you lvld your shammy at all yet
[6:50:04] GreenEagleActual: @Rectiphly wrong
[6:50:08] Helmzii: would be cool to implement "customisable skins" for promotion use for creators, instead of rolling ads. I would rather see OW2 skins on a lot of shit ingame, instead of watching ads
[6:50:11] eggsmasher: i just watch another stream. when i get ads :P
[6:50:16] davelit: shroudHmm
[6:50:27] flashnickgg: RainbowPls
[6:50:28] CraniumCrank: @joshface2 that would prob be the only answer for everyone to be happy eiht
[6:50:38] wesudesuu: @joshface2 Sounds like something that would affect the average consumer playing the game outside of streaming it.
[6:50:39] asbolution_: We call that the overton window chat, random fact for ya
[6:50:46] GreenEagleActual: @Rectiphly i get [Blocking Ads[
[6:50:54] blippi21: oh no shroudy be careful
[6:50:59] DougTheApache: I don't know if I like the idea of ads being in a game that you already pay for. Maybe if its free-to-play
[6:51:00] Empirible: @Helmzii then they just make skins that stand out and are easy to see/shoot
[6:51:06] Rectiphly: @Rectiphly yea so its still interrupting the stream
[6:51:08] GreenEagleActual: @Rectiphly but still see the stream
[6:51:11] Raayyo__: is it to late for new fresh player to play wow for the 1st time what u think

[6:51:27] Rectiphly: @Rectiphly what adblock is this i want to look at the source code
[6:51:30] blippi21: there ateknik to completely block ads but not worth it tho
[6:51:32] soClutchItHurts: dom dolla head

[6:53:14] THERisenEclipse: @Rectiphly mine does. not for the ad when you join the stream tho. I'm using the brave browser which has its own adblocker
[6:53:15] blippi21: letsgooo
[6:53:19] ZeakinHD: What’s the addon you use to change your font!! @shroud
[6:53:19] wesudesuu: The campaign was amazing
[6:53:24] DougTheApache: They're actually some of the best stories in the COD franchise
[6:53:27] Sadory: when ?
[6:53:33] craterrman: profess0r_hype subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! Hey @shroud I am a huge fan and also a game dev, I made a cool ARPG called Dwarven Realms that is in closed Alpa, want to play it?
[6:53:34] Rectiphly: @THERisenEclipse oh well brave pays amazon LOL
[6:53:36] CraniumCrank: graphics look amazing but i dont think the 4090 can handle it KEKW
[6:53:44] Rectiphly: @THERisenEclipse thats how that works
[6:53:44] MustardTigrs: Spam flash of light?

[6:54:09] GreenEagleActual: unfortunately you link that extension to twitch, it gets a little road block by twitch, no thanks\
[6:54:11] ChowChowDad: mw2 campaign is pretty dope. Im enjoying it as much I did the originals
[6:54:12] itzBlaZn: Problem is COD follows the same narrative generally
[6:54:14] keyrihh: Does he raid in off time ? He's like full bis already
[6:54:23] TheRagingUnicorn: aw i got my first hate paragraph and i wasnt even here
[6:54:25] TheRagingUnicorn: KEKW
[6:54:25] asbolution_: font changes in wow can be handled by Masque, chat. Also, if you use Masque, download SharedMedia.
[6:54:34] Rectiphly: they just pay amazon with some of their revenue along with other ad providers to remove some of the more intrusive ads
[6:54:37] asbolution_: @TheRagingUnicorn Want me to send you one? Kappa
[6:54:37] blippi21: anyone in da chat who plays cod and looks ak 47 xD

[8:13:11] KegRodeoClown: I play bear tank. I have 47k hp, 30k armor and 42% dodge
[8:13:11] asbolution_: ye but 90% of fights dont need a HP soak tank
[8:13:14] SoulmaskTV: like soda
[8:13:14] ChubbyMikey: @rectiphly soda would like a word
[8:13:18] asbolution_: which is all bear does
[8:13:26] Rectiphly: @ChubbyMikey hes an exception not the rule
[8:13:34] Rectiphly: i said most ferals suck
[8:13:46] ChubbyMikey: oh... you think he's an exception?
[8:13:49] SoulmaskTV: warriors still have the best CDs
[8:13:54] Lilroy504: ive only played pvp feral

[8:14:19] StreamElements: @klunatic12, He uses the Dell Alienware AW2721D 240Hz ips, https://amzn.com/dp/B08LR145ZY
[8:14:21] C0smozero: 2 or 3
[8:14:24] Rectiphly: a well played feral is arguably the best class in wotlk
[8:14:31] legionere: yea soda plays feral very well
[8:14:36] notColt45: people thought feral would pump now, but they aren't
[8:14:41] asbolution_: true, but most fights just work better with anything thats not feral tank in wrath just how it was
[8:14:45] Rectiphly: but thats the issue is its a harder class to play and most of the ppl who play feral suck at it
[8:14:59] Empirible: imagine trying to justify a position when there is no new knowledge the dominos have just been restacked
[8:15:00] Niceeeeeeeeeeeeee: !addons
