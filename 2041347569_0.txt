[0:08:24] zachgamegodx: in the tabs
[0:08:25] agren13: i'm worried about warrior fear if they kept the talent that increases threshhold by 200%
[0:08:40] zachgamegodx: uncheck talent
[0:08:47] likeewlock: so fear still looks trash with dmg
[0:09:10] Grimey_George: Some classes have even more fear breaking resistance. what happens if they spec into those talents.
[0:09:28] DeityRevert: talent trees text not updated
[0:09:54] zachgamegodx: id do ring of fire bc each tick will do a % of hi shp

[0:11:31] Zarkos: ayyyy

[0:11:36] Zarkos: lets go
[0:11:41] zachgamegodx: might get some value
[0:12:01] axxll1: hmm what do i wanna gear?  how's aff lock

[0:12:40] prtwentyfour: extra PVP tuning is tomorrow
[0:12:46] shikari01: did warlocks get the armor buff?
[0:12:47] JSaucy_v1: was watching Chan a little bit ago, he was saying fear threshold felt really good
[0:12:47] prtwentyfour: the 24th
[0:12:49] Zarkos: ty ty
[0:12:56] Aiakos21: now that conquest is uncapped i can't wait to get mastery set for fire
[0:12:57] zachgamegodx: he means the bear form nerf/lock neutralization
[0:13:01] prtwentyfour: lock demon skins reduced by half

[0:13:20] prtwentyfour: wowhead had that change tomorrow
[0:13:24] zachgamegodx: proly asking ur thoughts on the additions they made last minute
[0:13:29] ihavesmokedcrack: Nah tomorrow is eu
[0:13:35] sweeziest: yeah the extra bit where they nerfed demon skin & bear form
[0:13:37] JSaucy_v1: the demon armor nerf was today
[0:13:44] azliaris1: hows the patch feel so far
[0:13:50] zachgamegodx: locks basically got no armor from the change is what i calculatd
[0:13:50] candid_oak: hope ur having a good day dude! BOP
[0:13:52] rekt1370: so peoeple were saying plate armor nerf isn't much my fully geared ret goes from 36 percent reduced physical to 27 percent in pvp
[0:14:02] shikari01: I coulda swore ven said something about demo locks going to be harder to fight.
[0:14:13] ihavesmokedcrack: 6-0 ret lobby
[0:14:24] aaggros: they reverted the strgth nerf from armor loss for warriors
[0:14:31] JSaucy_v1: ret damage is pretty wild now
[0:14:46] EliteDamit: Green lizard time 😎
[0:14:48] Roensoul: When you target pvp dummy, reduce dmg from armor is different
[0:15:08] rekt1370: its when you enter pvp your armor get reduced
[0:15:11] rekt1370: it drops by like 2.5k
[0:15:18] Roensoul: I got 50% dmg reduce from armor as fully geared ret.
[0:15:31] Roensoul: Pvp dummy
[0:15:37] zachgamegodx: everyone should have between 15-26% physical reduction aside from evokers and especially augmentation evokers
[0:15:55] axxll1: i remember when they broke ret last time i had never touched ret and got up to 2360 in shuffle.  went to bed gonna get elite in AM and they hotfixed it overnight lol
[0:16:16] zachgamegodx: evokers will remain at around 35% physical dmg reduction
[0:16:36] JSaucy_v1: @axxll1 heard that.  I was playing ret when they put in the hotfix.  felt  so weird.
[0:16:53] DeityRevert: @zachgamegodx 54% in pvp current
[0:17:14] zachgamegodx: @DeityRevert nah, that's not true. you're looking at "against current target"

[0:22:34] BMaStream: Anyone familiar with potent venom and toxified armor embellishment? Curious how worth it is
[0:22:44] rekt1370: its the best for hunters
[0:22:46] rawrces: time stop should work like mages alter, but usable on allies
[0:22:48] Magottx: you are not seeinng mages face tank melee lol chill out
[0:22:52] rekt1370: those embellishments
[0:23:02] loveandsupply: pretty sure they didn’t need to do that pvp armor decreases lol leave us plate players alone
[0:23:05] BMaStream: @rekt1370 Do you know how often it procs or for how much?
[0:23:19] rekt1370: @BMaStream  yea it procs pretty often and it gives over 2k vers
[0:23:20] SweatyDaniels: they should give prev an aura that lets you heal thru LOS like the hunter thing
[0:23:29] BMaStream: @rekt1370 Thank you
[0:23:36] rekt1370: @BMaStream  wait nvm 1k vers
[0:23:52] DeityRevert: @zachgamegodx you were half right. it's 40%

[0:39:38] foxyllama: ya dude
[0:39:40] foxyllama: im gonna go insane
[0:39:41] ImJordanHi: The best way to actually burst with stormkeeper is use the bolts back to back, you get 2 instant casts
[0:39:45] foxyllama: i fkn love smexxin
[0:39:53] Smexxin: time to go full haste vers for omega lavas
[0:39:54] khrylx_: but youd have to drop a lot to get sk
[0:40:09] khrylx_: nvm its 1 pt lol
[0:40:10] Falcanus: go master of elements, another 20% on lightning bolt after you cast lava burst
[0:40:23] Falcanus: drop 1 pt in deluge
[0:40:26] rhokie_hunt: howdy
[0:40:59] zachgamegodx: thats so good

[0:42:11] ImJordanHi: I can invite you, if you want but you declined last tim
[0:42:19] ihavesmokedcrack: I'm going full dmg resto to get fast ques as new ele lol
[0:42:29] BMaStream: I just got my 1800 on every class wooo
[0:42:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that stormkeeper has been kind of OP, and with these buffs....
[0:42:57] dankent130: lol 121k
[0:42:59] Ernanz: 121K as Resto Sham is a lot
[0:43:03] dankent130: da fuq
[0:43:07] ImJordanHi: Stormkeeper, lava burst, lightning bolt, lightning bolt
[0:43:09] ImJordanHi: try that
[0:43:12] boltozor: foxy says meatball, never says LB
[0:43:26] Hobblefoot: I mean as a supplement to the DPS damage, those are all possible match ending damage spells.
[0:43:34] EliteDamit: surely if you spread flame shocks and use a targetoftarget macro for lava burst you can pump so much inbetween heals ? LUL
[0:43:50] ImJordanHi: When you cast stormkeeper, you get 2 lightning bolts that are instant cast. You keep using one, then hard casting another lava burst
[0:43:56] ImJordanHi: You can just send both lightning bolts back to back, for faster burst
[0:44:04] dankent130: I’m truly liking where resto shaman is right now.
[0:44:06] misterblaht: "Sauce. Meat. Good. I lasso here. Leg."
[0:44:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember Sterge nuking someone with stormkeeper in AWC
[0:44:13] ZiegeOG: Morning Ven! did we get some class changes?
[0:44:16] Badasti: i like playing with Lava Surge as well
[0:44:22] Zeniticon: just dont fall behind on healing

[0:44:27] Xeliumimar: holy medic boxes man you can gear a whole toon
[0:44:29] Snewch: The move RPS about to be fire
[0:44:31] lundbergmackan: @ImJordanHi but you loose the buff from lava burst, so thats not worth t
[0:44:36] chancywilson: stormkeeper is fun, its very telegraphed most good players will avoid u or cc
[0:44:38] BMaStream: I use stormkeeper when I have downtime like a purge or something and people pop defensives because of it
[0:44:42] foxyllama: dont need to heal if their dead
[0:44:43] dropbombsss: holy priest time
[0:44:50] Averyzan: at least they finally uncapped conquest
[0:44:50] ImJordanHi: @lundbergmackan Its less burst, if you can do 20% less damage but it happens 100% faster, its worth it
[0:44:52] Juliio29: okay show him how it’s done
[0:44:54] Badasti: foxy sold me on the haste dream last night
[0:44:54] xFredHx: can u share the totem nameplate addon/wa?

[0:47:38] dankent130: the dam makes the difference
[0:47:40] Bombdiggity3315: what direction are you referring to?
[0:47:43] Rzzzi: are conquest boxes in?
[0:47:44] clicket: I logged on and felt so much lighter without my armor :(
[0:47:55] waitimdesyncd: @theredtour  you are saying that by asking a comment on lays for a singular industry when most people across all industries have experiences layoffs in their life. Its how jobs work
[0:47:55] lundbergmackan: @Rzzzi yup
[0:47:56] Cdenzy: I played against ww warrior and they ran me down every game FeelsBadMan
[0:47:58] Rzzzi: thanks
[0:47:59] ImShmoly: whats the idea behind the change you think?
[0:48:00] pvalue01: I was having trouble noticing the dam but need more games I think
[0:48:00] pisceslonewolf: Huh, what's that. Armed? He's armed? I can't hear
[0:48:04] Gotheels: fw buffed by armor nerfs?
[0:48:05] nightmxz: WW and MM hunters benefit the most off of less armour
[0:48:12] bulgarian_beefer: I play healers to heal.
[0:48:14] nightmxz: maybe outlaw too
[0:48:16] dankent130: a good shaman can shutdown 1 player  hard and los them bad depending on map
[0:48:22] xilyx2: hunter
[0:48:29] Smexxin: outlaw fury ww mm hunter
[0:48:31] Averyzan: isn't the armor change like 1-3% dmg reduction difference for physical in most cases?
[0:48:37] Falcanus: only thing they need is more HP on totems and Earthen wall to be an aura around a player
[0:48:37] nightmxz: I forgot fury existed LMAO
[0:48:42] pvalue01: Agree, healers all should have decent damage and powerful utility. More impact on kills = more fun = more healers
[0:48:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: healers doing more damage would be better for the game, more impact is more fun
[0:48:49] adamjsmithmusique: but the stam buff to trink set will help offset armor
[0:49:01] dankent130: they do not need more hps for totems
[0:49:03] Tuckbudford: Everyone dies in 2 seconds anyway who cares about armor
[0:49:08] boltozor: you know shamans gonna be offensively POG when even mmarkers is dusting off his resto shaman
[0:49:11] CinematX: yeah aff doesnt feel tankier at all
[0:49:12] dcode200: yeah like they dont die fast enough
[0:49:12] pisceslonewolf: That's a pretty weird change since clothies needed more armor more than plate needed less
[0:49:27] Averyzan: maybe, have to see. I feel like people were freaking out a lot. generaly agree with you that armor matters way less in pvp t
[0:49:28] Falcanus: too much of shamans healing is built into earthen, needs to be an aura to put on an ally
[0:49:31] Sosatko: Watching dews DH/DK vs MVQs DH/DK last night that matchup is so chaotic lol
[0:49:33] Sosatko: the damage is insane
[0:49:42] dankent130: with everyone wanting tier set bonuses I feel most people aren’t running 40% vers
[0:49:43] damiandbomb: hey ven how do y ou get the battle mender title
[0:49:47] SammyLettuce: this is a 6-0 lobby i can smell it
[0:49:48] misterblaht: 3%= sky is falling.
[0:49:50] xilyx2: wow player base.. overreact? crazy talk
[0:49:52] Sosatko: The damage is absurd
[0:49:53] pisceslonewolf: @Sosatko Which Dew?
[0:49:57] Sosatko: the evokers are doing 250k hps
[0:49:57] dankent130: I have seen a lot of 16-20% vers
[0:49:58] happyheals: ret dh is strong
[0:50:00] Sosatko: and stuff is still dying
[0:50:00] nightmxz: @Sosatko ?? Cdew only has to do 250k hps to keep hi steam alive what's the problem?? Kappa
[0:50:09] Averyzan: I think you are right Ven about armor not being that noticeable in pvp
[0:50:13] obstata: am i being a lil baby or are DH just broken
[0:50:15] Axtin: i kinda feel like the only problematic armor matchup was hunters vs mages
[0:50:15] Sosatko: @nightmxz Yeah only 250k  HPS LOL
[0:50:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH is going to be fun, until you run into a ret paladin! LUL
[0:50:24] pisceslonewolf: @Axtin 100%
[0:50:25] shitywok: what about arms warrior, no buffs forever and now more squishy
[0:50:32] obstata: they do a bajillion damage always it never slows down
[0:50:40] pisceslonewolf: 15 seconds?
[0:50:42] nightmxz: @Axtin MM hunters into plate was rough as well
[0:50:44] pisceslonewolf: 12 something like that
[0:50:51] ChilledsDogTreats: you got 15 seconds of stormkeeper bud
[0:50:55] Smexxin: ^ @nightmxz
[0:50:58] happyheals: I looked at stats and dh had about the same amount of matches as the bottom 13 dps combined in 1800+ solo shuffle
[0:51:02] dankent130: a good rogue or a good war will always do well in, any situation
[0:51:40] pisceslonewolf: @happyheals I checked lots of stats yesterday. And the melee vs caster representation is wild in every bracket KEKW
[0:51:52] Axtin: @nightmxz ive always felt like mm hunter vs plate is more of a defense issue for the hunter
[0:52:02] haste88: naah you had time
[0:52:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure rogues have a ton of potential, the only question is at the high end with meta
[0:52:22] dipicat: heart of the wild affecting clonme is cooked
[0:52:23] pisceslonewolf: Just remove cyclone
[0:52:26] Aiakos21: thats not a hot take at all
[0:52:26] dipicat: 0.1 second clones so bad
[0:52:36] nightmxz: @Axtin I think they go hand-in-hand in that way though, a big way of getting melee off you is threatening them with damage and MM wasn't scary at all
[0:52:37] waitimdesyncd: ret doing 70k dps into uhdk and enha with perma pets isnt really impressive
[0:52:39] ArdellanDH: YES !!!!@ THOSE CLONES ARE STUPID FAST
[0:52:39] Averyzan: yesterday I got hit for a 900k+ ele blast in rbgs while holding a flag. not even that many stacks
[0:52:47] dipicat: fighting fmp while feral has heart and mage is spam polying just hurts my brain
[0:52:48] BMaStream: Hot take: I think if a druid gets kicked they shouldn't be able to shapeshift
[0:52:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've always wanted a cooldown on cyclone
[0:53:02] pisceslonewolf: Cooldown on cyclone SeemsGood ^
[0:53:02] dankent130: tbh druids that know they can go boomkin form after hots are up don’t belong in the 1400 brackets
[0:53:19] JSaucy_v1: @Axtin yeah, since mobility is so high for melee, the only defensive is pumping dam into them to get them to back off, which, until now has always been an issue into plate
[0:53:32] Axtin: @nightmxz yea thats valid
[0:53:35] dankent130: I think it sucks because be locked in over 2k mmr in 476 greens trying to get conquest
[0:53:58] pisceslonewolf: @JSaucy_v1 It's the issue for all casters except arcane/frost maybe
[0:53:58] dankent130: being*
[0:54:00] grifnballs: how do you get totems life bar to show a different color like that?
[0:54:16] malvarcla: yeah nerf resto sham please, too much damage
[0:54:17] pisceslonewolf: @grifnballs WA I think. Got it recently
[0:54:17] JSaucy_v1: @pisceslonewolf word
[0:54:20] waitimdesyncd: @dankent130  can you just play 2s, 3s or blitz for conq?
[0:54:31] grifnballs: @pisceslonewolf which WA?
[0:54:32] wallstreet12345: lol
[0:54:34] krisdahaka: ded
[0:54:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: That was rude LUL

[0:54:45] Axtin: @nightmxz warriors and dks right now just happen to smoke hunters right now with their kit though i think, with warriors having 2 stuns+disarm and dk having double grip
[0:54:47] malvarcla: oh its Augreye, that dude is cheese build
[0:54:47] foxyllama: lmfao

[0:55:39] sinzzutheshaman: sp huge, lock not so mutch, ww huge, ret squishy af
[0:55:39] Averyzan: not like it's possible to look at death details and how fast someone died. some of these people love to grief for no reason.
[0:55:39] justzugtv: who tachii?
[0:55:41] pisceslonewolf: @Greenmich17 Love those!

[0:56:39] nightmxz: @Axtin Yeah it's definitely a rough matchup which is fair, there should be harder matchups but also hitting them for 7% less AND being disadvantaged in kit was too much
[0:56:40] SonexaM: I noticed some people take this way too seriously. I understand wanting to win but isn’t the goal to have fun?
[0:56:40] dankent130: @waitimdesyncd the crappy part is the 20 min queue times on your dps, u can solo shuffle queue and gear your healer faster with conquest than you can doing bgs on your damage char
[0:56:41] chancywilson: stormkeeper gunna be better in 2s or rated 3 then this choas
[0:56:49] pisceslonewolf: Holy paragraphs
[0:57:10] dankent130: at least the conquest queuing solo shuffle on your healer is BOA
[0:57:18] keenomglol: @rzzzi exactly

[0:57:44] waitimdesyncd: @dankent130  yeah, but you said yourself youre too high mmr to get value from solo shuffle, so you can insta queue 2s and 3s, and afk queue blitz.

[1:03:22] SonexaM: So we will probably see ele shaman in AWC?
[1:03:22] vantimere: well, looks like im gonna put my mage in the fridge with these shamans around ;P
[1:04:05] pisceslonewolf: Meh. Why can't link Twitch's own clip link...
[1:04:05] BMaStream: "Inv to decurse layer"
[1:04:37] pisceslonewolf: @vantimere This is a RARE lobby. Not the meta
[1:04:42] chewyzxd: so i have to watch for 4 hours and i get the toy?
[1:04:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: noooooooooooo
[1:04:55] itzshenny: ele 1 win
[1:04:59] chewyzxd: thatll be ez bc i do that everyday
[1:04:59] SonexaM: after that 1 shot they are keeping you controled
[1:05:02] obstata: what was that loot lol
[1:05:08] pisceslonewolf: It can be very fun
[1:05:13] Xeliumimar: looks like ele needs a buff
[1:05:15] ShaHugs: ele carrying the lobby by donating cr
[1:05:17] svzx29: why is rshaman lava burst doing more dmg then ele
[1:05:18] figurines: is it just mastery stacking ele?
[1:05:18] CloudyKibii: do you play WotLK arenas? @venruki
[1:05:30] Badasti: shots fired
[1:05:33] FlyFYI: if its in the game there is always gonna be someone that uses it
[1:05:35] chewyzxd: like MitchJones LOL Pog
[1:05:40] IWCarry: because mastery
[1:05:53] cassmann: why does ret WoG heal for more than holy WoG
[1:05:53] malvarcla: surely that has to be an over exaggeration right?
[1:06:07] pisceslonewolf: You still need about 8 lava bursts to kill a player
[1:06:08] Abruty: shouldnt they just not shoot a million lava burst ?
[1:06:08] malvarcla: im trolling
[1:06:14] svzx29: Yes it does but insta proc lb hitting 120k is alot for a healer tbh
[1:06:14] allenlondon210: is enhance benefiting from stam buff
[1:06:14] nnumbing: ven sounds spicy today :P
[1:06:21] 330am: Demo seems easier to play than Affi
[1:06:23] soddi: 100 mio. is technically correct
[1:06:24] Badasti: they should make ele shaman lavabursts exactly like resto and  stop with this gattling gun meatball fiesta
[1:06:31] pisceslonewolf: Now it's probably more like 9-10 lava bursts to kill anyone
[1:06:34] SonexaM: that is understandable. to keep balance, or attempt to, in the game between specs
[1:06:40] 330am: did the buffs hit for ret/spriest today?
[1:06:42] Axtin: not an exaggeration, he actually meant 100 million
[1:06:47] korgare: Any noticeable changes Ven?
[1:06:49] ItsBees: They have random conquest gear boxes Pog
[1:07:03] malvarcla: can you go into the details and count exactly how many?
[1:07:08] SonexaM: I haven’t done any pvp with my shaman yet
[1:07:09] IWCarry: its good for resto to distinguish from other healers being more agressive choice
[1:07:20] jamesip87: is resto sham hard to learn?
[1:07:32] BMaStream: @venruki https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyNGHBV3_lo
[1:07:34] ItsBees: LUL
[1:07:40] pisceslonewolf: And he gets a lucky proc as well KEKW
[1:07:42] obstata: lol nailed that demonstration haha

[1:07:52] Six_awc: yes
[1:07:53] betasoldier: If I'm the only one that can do it, yes.
[1:08:02] pisceslonewolf: @betasoldier SeemsGood
[1:08:06] ShaHugs: ele doing 800k in just over a second is jokes
[1:08:08] chervz: goooooood morning!
[1:08:17] malvarcla: if more meatball more damage?

[1:08:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Meatball!
[1:08:46] ShaHugs: @pisceslonewolf if you count r1s in 3s losing to it multiples times in a row not strong then sure
[1:09:05] Badasti: anything that kills you in less than 1.5 sec shouldnt exist in this game, because if you start a global you cant even react
[1:09:13] lundbergmackan: Time to gear your hpriest @venruki
[1:09:20] korgare: Any noticeable changes Ven?
[1:09:23] figurines: @venruki I hit a 250k LB!
[1:09:26] ShaHugs: gg I was the lightning bolt
[1:09:45] pisceslonewolf: @ShaHugs Sounds like you are watching RMP Pepega streamers or something. Getting killed by the oneshot build = you failed. By normal Ele - it's not even comparable dmg.
[1:10:07] SlyMooseMan: Isn't haste your worst stat?
[1:10:09] ShaHugs: @pisceslonewolf if you count pikaboo/sterge/wizk as rmp streamers then sure lol

[1:10:56] BeakrTTV: is conq uncapped finally
[1:10:57] johnnyQT: to an extent of course
[1:10:58] rekt1370: why would you torture yourself with sparks when conquest is uncapped
[1:11:02] lundbergmackan: @BeakrTTV y
[1:11:04] pisceslonewolf: @ItsBees Isn't that the catalyst?
[1:11:12] ItsBees: yes :3
[1:11:16] aseiadk: @rekt1370 crafted pieces balance stats
[1:11:21] Badasti: @RogueStabin sub will never be trash so long as it is unkillable and has the amount of cc it has

[1:13:47] dmicrl: anyone else audio desynced?
[1:13:47] BMaStream: Right you are Ken
[1:13:52] ItsBees: @pisceslonewolf for some reason I thought the currency for the catalyst was called a spark LUL
[1:14:00] pisceslonewolf: @ItsBees Thought that might be it
[1:14:19] 서약님: nickle back‘s…

[1:15:50] HolyXct: Watching @venruki while eating a bowl of ramen and drinking zero coke is the best entertainment i could ever have
[1:16:35] Aiakos21: stormkeeper at same time as tide every time
[1:16:41] ShaHugs: need more enhance lobbies
[1:16:42] ALLtheEXP: There are two kinds of people in this world. Those who love Nickelback and those who lie about not loving Nickelback
[1:16:47] Taevenx: you do more dam if you say something about throwing meatballs with sauce
[1:16:48] xRoastyz: is battle mender permanent?

[1:18:53] pisceslonewolf: @Taevenx You need to chill with the trolling mate xP
[1:18:56] Averyzan: it blows my mind they were giving frost and feral like 5 percent buffs. made sure they were only pve. but ret gets like 20% on 5 abilities
[1:18:58] Abruty: its time for the return of the Retribuki!
[1:19:16] phillybottz34: wait is conq boxes out???

[1:21:46] misterblaht: Like the ret comments rn?
[1:21:46] Aiakos21: went 5 rounds on lock without getting trained. the propaganda is nice
[1:21:46] phillybottz34: a good outlaw rogue is aids
[1:21:48] Smexxin: assume the worst instead of waiting to see the reality
[1:21:50] Golden_Snack: tbh armor nerf is kinda big deal
[1:21:55] NomFries: rip dk
[1:21:58] ghostware9000: my god i just started healing shuffle again and all i see is demon hunters

[1:22:54] ShaHugs: lock armor got nerfed
[1:23:01] Mcaveryst: dk's got a 10% nerf on their death coil which is their highest damage but ur big dps comes from ur set ups with death and decay and popping festerings
[1:23:03] xilyx2: they nerfed demon skin is what happened
[1:23:10] mgbanks083: I don't know, when engaged with the pvp dummy demon skin still shows 90%
[1:23:17] ladidaada: They changed demon skin last minute
[1:23:22] chizzad52: All the other clothies got a big armor buff and theirs after the demon skin change was a very small buff
[1:23:38] jheas1: i was playing my AFF lock in 2s today around 2k and it felt a lil tankier
[1:23:39] xilyx2: @mgbanks083 check the values maybe its a tooltip error
[1:23:52] HolyXct: is it me or are all warlocks really bad at positioning in solo shuffle and 3s?
[1:24:00] ShaHugs: rip
[1:24:05] malvarcla: wow look what the armor changes did. Made locks immortal.
[1:24:14] pisceslonewolf: He's on Tinder

[1:24:36] Roensoul: armor change didn't affect to ret at all :D and got buffed
[1:24:38] JSaucy_v1: @DruidFlames warlocks are very reliant on their healer positioning, mainly around their ports
[1:24:39] Golden_Snack: and rogs are still OP af

[1:28:00] storm_chaser_ron: 25 a min probably beats what gets charged to insurance here
[1:28:00] Rzzzi: in finland too, hate it
[1:28:04] ShaHugs: wait times to get a GP is rough
[1:28:05] Bonegraft: 25? in america it would be like 150 minimum
[1:28:05] pisceslonewolf: @xtpwow It's not free. It's subsidized and still costs a small amount
[1:28:13] HolyXct: @xtpwow think your taxes include it

[1:28:41] storm_chaser_ron: @StromicusRex i'll do it for a third that as long as you dont expect medical advice after
[1:28:42] ShaHugs: 2325
[1:28:43] Damiusx: Imagine how fun wow pvp would be rn if you just had insta queues for shuffle as DPS. Makes me sad that I can't have that, I don't have time for current queues, and I'm rly tired of healing just for fast queues 🥺
[1:28:45] jamesip87: got to check out the ret power

[1:32:07] ALLtheEXP: dayseeker
[1:32:08] boundric: faced 2 SP today. they were doing good damage and felt like a tank.
[1:32:18] siouxuhcide: DNB
[1:32:18] lundbergmackan: you can listen to "stick season"
[1:32:35] ryanblue98: Emo for the warriors today
[1:32:42] xilyx2: im surprised i havent seen more spriests yea
[1:32:56] Mcaveryst: wizk is streaming so it must be aight lol
[1:33:15] samiyam: i heard druid mana got overnerfed
[1:33:15] sTyless310: mornin

[1:33:18] samiyam: we kinda take those
[1:33:25] ryanblue98: its nice clickbait
[1:33:28] Boredom0115: I can heal you ven if you want
[1:33:29] ArdellanDH: It's good
[1:33:32] ItsJhelo: fuck those r druids man
[1:33:36] What_ln_Tarnation: 5% is over nerf?
[1:33:44] samiyam: apparently it wasnt 5% @What_ln_Tarnation
[1:33:44] W00dyyx: "ReworkWW"
[1:33:51] What_ln_Tarnation: nice
[1:33:53] Taevenx: who needs a healer? just play double lock
[1:34:12] SwiisH_Tv: just tuning in from work. are warlocks as busted as we thought?
[1:34:14] samiyam: im obviously biased but i do feel rdruid mana should have been nerfed a little more mistake or not
[1:34:35] keenomglol: Affliction felt so odd to play last time I played it. Maybe I just don't get how to play it
[1:34:37] gdodmebxu: treants KEKW
[1:34:39] What_ln_Tarnation: treants should have been nerfed imo
[1:34:42] unfixed43543: im bad but find on hpal i out mana r druid
[1:34:47] samiyam: needs rework for sure
[1:34:51] ryanblue98: remove clone Kappa
[1:34:52] samiyam: v sad what rdruid has become
[1:34:53] ItsBees: rdruid and boomy need an overhaul
[1:34:59] samiyam: most fun healer to ever exist imo
[1:35:03] clicket: mana isn't even the issue is it? Like, other healers outmana them without drinks
[1:35:13] raspador: All the healer need to be in druid level
[1:35:17] ATHLTE: lmao remove clone LUL LUL
[1:35:21] raspador: That how you fix the metal
[1:35:22] gdodmebxu: @clicket meld drink KEKW
[1:35:24] ImJordanHi: 5 min CD HOTW is fine...but 1 minute procs??? wtf
[1:35:30] jheas1: make cyclone dispellable like every other cc
[1:35:30] Mcaveryst: Rdruid's just seem to have never ending healing like theres a point where it feels like healing drops off after CD's for most healers where Rdruid just always got something in their pocket
[1:35:32] clicket: @gdodmebxu yeah, but that's a drinking issue not a mana issue
[1:35:33] jaydogztv: @samiyam do you think boomy will be able to live
[1:35:51] JSaucy_v1: put cyclone on a cd and give them a kick
[1:35:53] unfixed43543: I think its cos other healers dont have as much output through cc mainly
[1:35:59] xilyx2: LUL
[1:36:04] ferahgok: lol sike
[1:36:12] JSaucy_v1: *range kick
[1:36:25] gelatokush: ive been playing my mage this mornign can confirm still dies and fast MyAvatar
[1:36:27] boundric: crit aim shot from across the map!
[1:36:29] Axtin: cyclone having a cd is an awful idea and im def biased
[1:36:31] samiyam: probably not @jaydogztv think boomkin is not viable now
[1:36:35] lukeyboy468: Did Ww monk get any changes
[1:36:51] Ernanz: what you want mages to be tanky? lol majority of mages dont even know how to bait pets into a different spot to then attack for example
[1:36:56] JSaucy_v1: why not if it's not dispellable?
[1:37:10] dtbmar: yooo ven how we doing
[1:37:11] Ronn_Deezy: i dont even play druid and I dont think that
[1:37:11] ArdellanDH: Cyclone needs to be 1 min cd
[1:37:12] ItzSmuggs: @lukeyboy468 2-piece nerf
[1:37:12] dmicrl: make it 15yr range
[1:37:18] figurines: mages and rogues are just 0% fun to face. i dislike that I dont have fun fighting them
[1:37:26] crookedmanx: so how are the changes? anything especially notable about the armor changes?
[1:37:26] fors_sp: @JSaucy_v1 cause its been like that since the existence of wow and its not been a problem lol
[1:37:27] gdodmebxu: yeah the cast time is way too short
[1:37:29] boundric: is kul tiran mage useful?
[1:37:29] ATHLTE: yea nerf the haste it makes no sense
[1:37:31] Ronn_Deezy: quick cast clone should be gone. but clone shouldnt have a cdd
[1:37:34] ArdellanDH: It would force the player to make a wise choice to use it
[1:37:39] psychic241: remember how fast clones were in mop? and that was fun
[1:37:43] Hankst: clone would be fine without treants, treants give druid too much freedom to do anything
[1:37:43] xilyx2: should be instant cast
[1:37:47] ATHLTE: clone having a cd is a hella fried take lmao
[1:37:54] jmonttheking: just make clone dispellable
[1:37:59] OutlandishOW: boomies are a plague in rbgs too, absolutely have to have 1 or 2
[1:37:59] Breadmanfun: ferals insta cast pog
[1:38:02] gelatokush: just makes clone dispelable
[1:38:07] OutlandishOW: simply because of clone
[1:38:07] crookedmanx: notable Armour changes?
[1:38:16] storm_chaser_ron: haymaker is great
[1:38:22] boundric: lol that gut
[1:38:22] lfkappachupa: do have any tip to deal with rogues as hunter?
[1:38:29] ItsBees: it feels awesome as a MM hunter though :D
[1:38:40] Aroty: The stam buff more noticable?
[1:38:43] carneasada34: they absolutely boned shamans with this armor change
[1:38:43] crookedmanx: mages still getting destroyed by hunters?
[1:38:46] OutlandishOW: @lfkappachupa go next
[1:39:02] BulkyManticore: shaman in 2s sounds miserable
[1:39:03] Nitsud97: @venruki how ret feels?
[1:39:08] gdodmebxu: @carneasada34 there are not many specs that do phys dmg to begin with
[1:39:16] OutlandishOW: the lack of MS is kind of a problem
[1:39:20] BulkyManticore: get trained every game
[1:39:22] lfkappachupa: @OutlandishOW i feel i cant do something but maybe i am just bad
[1:39:25] tarth_100: knocked out my 2100 push in 2s with rsham yesterday lol. Its very fun
[1:39:25] borrlock: I hate going against sham in 2s as a caster around 2300 mmr
[1:39:28] skez_live: id say shaman in 2s would be more fun haha
[1:39:29] lordelenath: How big to the changes feel for now? Armor, fear/root break, ret dmg?
[1:41:49] mateus_darc: @OutlandishOW what is MS?
[1:41:55] OutlandishOW: mortal strike
[1:42:01] mateus_darc: I see
[1:42:03] mateus_darc: THanks
[1:42:04] OutlandishOW: reduces healing received
[1:42:07] OutlandishOW: yep :)
[1:43:55] rekt1370: damn ret op
[1:43:56] boundric: would agro rsham be dumb to play sub 2kmmr?
[1:44:06] skez_live: ret damage looked go
[1:44:11] Aroty: Lol, he just couldn't reach you at all
[1:44:20] siouxuhcide: aggro shaman can play higher than 2k
[1:44:24] ryanblue98: also its twos not a ton of damage
[1:44:25] siouxuhcide: just depends on the comp you vs
[1:44:36] siouxuhcide: rsham is my fav class
[1:44:47] rekt1370: doesn't feel slow
[1:44:52] siouxuhcide: kul tiran > orc is close though
[1:45:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: More stamina, I can believe slower games
[1:45:04] siouxuhcide: haymaker into LOS into lasso
[1:45:05] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy thefurryslippers WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:45:08] siouxuhcide: into hex
[1:45:08] Smexxin: do it dude
[1:45:11] siouxuhcide: into windshear
[1:45:14] Axtin: people love to say stuff
[1:45:40] What_ln_Tarnation: SS ive done all felt slower
[1:45:40] siouxuhcide: stamina change didnt do anything for the pace of the game
[1:45:46] siouxuhcide: pace is still insanely fast
[1:45:47] Synkz_00: Not me, I definitely believe everything people say right off the rip
[1:45:48] Spaceberry_McDuck: people say i am the most handsome gentleman in the world.
[1:45:51] Jaxer3: best mage spec to pair with dev evoker 3s?
[1:45:54] Aroty: Ben is a first hand experience kind of guy
[1:45:56] CinematX: @Smexxin when can we see some Flowstate pvp
[1:45:57] What_ln_Tarnation: and by all SS i meant 2
[1:45:58] Aroty: Ven
[1:46:18] borrlock: How much health roughy did you gain from the trinket change?
[1:46:19] pure__goat: how does the game feel?
[1:46:23] Luigicamp: blobDance
[1:46:27] iamShorteh: @venruki with the armor buffs and nerfs, doesn't this point at scaling system from legion being the better option for tuning all along? only thing it required was an option to swap between main stat I think and it'd have been perfect, what do you think
[1:46:34] imkony: slower better no? more space to outperform others instead of random bs
[1:46:34] What_ln_Tarnation: 10%
[1:46:38] Cocoapuffs1: less than 200k hp
[1:46:41] rekt1370: everyone got like 100k more heath dks and locks a bit more
[1:46:47] catou56: Salut
[1:46:48] Peeray: bro how is affi?!? I’m so excited to log on hahaha
[1:46:49] 3KuLTV: what are feral druids like pvp?
[1:47:02] joyrex_j9: the bigger problem is that we were leaving stat choices up to blizzard
[1:47:11] What_ln_Tarnation: @rekt1370 and evokers they get like 8% more dam talen
[1:47:12] joyrex_j9: as far as legion went
[1:47:13] ryanblue98: Ams got big buff with hp  increase as it works off Hp
[1:47:16] Ernanz: DF is not a better xpac than Legion thats for sure homie
[1:47:23] Hankst: it's pretty bad to start playing mid season; joined with 2.5 mmr and green gear when everyone ran around in full gear with 4set already; that sucked
[1:47:31] iamShorteh: @joyrex_j9 as long as they make the values so that the specs work i don't mind it too much
[1:48:08] joyrex_j9: yeah, well they didn't
[1:48:11] Cocoapuffs1: @iamShorteh im still 1 of the ppl who think legion was the best tbh. sucks you couldnt customize your stats but definitely seemed most balanced
[1:48:11] joyrex_j9: lol
[1:48:16] Spaceberry_McDuck: @Ernanz i loved waiting over a year for RNG to give me my bis legendary
[1:48:28] joyrex_j9: many classes were left with the wrong stats for the entire expansion
[1:49:00] jheas1: priest healing is lol
[1:49:41] chewyzxd: yeah dude games seem wayyy long
[1:49:44] Ernanz: @Spaceberry_McDuck but it was hype to get them leggos
[1:49:51] chewyzxd: nobodys health is moving in the past 2 games i polayed
[1:49:57] Ernanz: tell me one item you got in DF that made you jump out your seat ill wait
[1:49:59] chewyzxd: and DH was lowest dmg for some reason
[1:50:36] fistweaveurnan: wouldnt be the first NPC pres evoker weve caught red handed
[1:50:38] zachgamegodx: evokers just have very robotic movement
[1:50:57] Ernanz: still waiting @Spaceberry_McDuck
[1:51:00] iamShorteh: @Cocoapuffs1 unironically agree with you, a tiny bit of customization was all it needed to have been finetuned forever
[1:51:20] skez_live: @venruki  it would be cool  if you did a zero to hero shuffle challenge, start a fresh character voted on by the stream and tank your mmr to like 1200 and push to 2k.
[1:51:25] didgeridoo1001: no
[1:51:27] dmicrl: looks like a blast
[1:51:28] Destruckt: yikes
[1:51:31] dmicrl: can’t wait
[1:51:33] jheas1: train the lock
[1:51:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: I can't bet against rets
[1:51:39] Cocoapuffs1: good test for the armor change xD
[1:51:41] Mcaveryst: lookin like a good test for that armor buff kekw
[1:51:42] vivadax: What is so good with being a night elf now?
[1:51:46] anon9753: very bad lobby for lock tbh
[1:52:03] RonWilson: it's not that bad
[1:52:07] DoYouWannaHug: Cant curse of exhaust with freedom
[1:52:08] RonWilson: it could have been ww warrior
[1:52:11] DoYouWannaHug: Its annoying with jinx
[1:52:33] gelatokush: i went 2-4 in my last lobby on frost mage everyone was calling me bad and shit NotLikeThis  i tried to tell em bm/rdruid/sham wasnt favorable for me
[1:52:52] ALLtheEXP: @gelatokush yo, they're bad if they don't know that
[1:53:02] CinematX: @DoYouWannaHug just weakness on rets no point in using exhaust when most of there stuff hits from range
[1:53:03] divinewhiz: DEATH BY NPC
[1:53:20] jheas1: jinx?
[1:53:30] DoYouWannaHug: Ya I know I'm just saying it because ven tried to exhaust ret for jinx dots @CinematX
[1:53:50] jheas1: it does if u have shards
[1:53:54] jheas1: oh

[1:53:58] jheas1: cause freedom
[1:54:09] Mcaveryst: ya u gotta weakness or tounges
[1:54:13] Mcaveryst: its just cus its exhaustion
[1:54:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: 15 pets attacking us!
[1:54:43] kreyzy8: maybe buffarcane should be renamed to buff aff Sadge
[1:54:44] BMaStream: No BoP no Ironbark
[1:54:44] PastaSeat: Ret had Sac too :/
[1:54:46] dmicrl: so much armor….
[1:54:54] jheas1: unkillable
[1:54:56] Mcaveryst: druid is doing 40k hps no one is gonna live that hps lol
[1:54:58] moremantella255: beard coming back?
[1:55:01] nightmxz: is the rdruid win trading?
[1:55:01] ALLtheEXP: clearly OP
[1:55:02] mat4th: healer dif?
[1:55:04] lordelenath: looks like the armor buff to locks is pretty op. needs nerf asap.
[1:55:06] micaiasf: playing warlock is miserable
[1:55:06] famous1939: def win trader
[1:55:11] aaggros: That happend to me yesterday around 2300
[1:55:14] jawst3k: well it’s 2300 shuffle so like 1800 maybe lol

[1:55:29] moremantella255: who plays dk anymore anyway thats old news we on to ret now
[1:55:33] DoYouWannaHug: wait is he playing judge dispel
[1:55:36] PastaSeat: Ret playing Judgment of the Pure into Aff lmao
[1:55:36] boundric: the Ret is playing judgement of the pure!
[1:55:37] ALLtheEXP: you have 0 hots
[1:55:39] lordelenath: not sure youre inspiring me to log onto my aff lock tomorrow venruke. not gonna lie.
[1:55:40] Tragictomb: I swear Bullmarket has been in like half of Ven’s lobbies the last few days
[1:55:49] famous1939: re-gate here
[1:55:55] belvedee: lmao the ret dispel
[1:56:05] DoYouWannaHug: he is playing judge dispel LUL
[1:56:44] vivadax: why is everyone a night elf?
[1:56:49] ALLtheEXP: meld
[1:56:57] boundric: meld is too useful
[1:56:57] vivadax: what is so good about meld?
[1:57:04] dj_efx: this looks so hectic
[1:57:06] ALLtheEXP: so broken
[1:57:08] klittconny: Patch live?
[1:57:14] DoYouWannaHug: you can immune cc with meld/drink/restealth etc
[1:57:16] Nayolana: When u have rot up u can spam drain life it will top u regardless of stacks especially if u put it on pets instead of players considering the questionable healer. u can bait kicks by faking the first one without buff that way too.
[1:57:16] lordelenath: getting kicked on aff lock is so fucking punishing its insane. its the main reason i dont enjoy mine right now
[1:57:17] El_Malaya: yo! i'm new in pvp, it's normal for sub rogues to deal significantly less damage than the other classes?
[1:57:20] nerfurface: try port CD talent
[1:57:27] codyallyn: just signed in, how do the changes feel?
[1:57:27] lordelenath: it doesnt feel that bad on any other class right now
[1:57:29] BIuffwatcher: basically like a vanish... can drop combat on spells.   or healers can meld drink
[1:57:35] Unarmd: impish
[1:57:38] Mrshmyt: dks and warriors are so unimaginably rough for a lock man
[1:57:38] Shway1013: them armor changes huh
[1:57:40] nightmxz: rdruid o nthe other team max heals, rdruid on your team 40k hps
[1:57:42] kreyzy8: @El_Malaya as far as overall damage...yes
[1:57:52] BIuffwatcher: seems 90% of specs that can be nelf are nelf
[1:57:53] Mcaveryst: guys this is literally just a horrible warlock lobby idk what else to say
[1:57:53] kreyzy8: @El_Malaya they just do big dam is short windows
[1:57:57] kreyzy8: in*
[1:58:13] smitesucks: good thing bm hunters got buffs they were down bad
[1:58:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: @El_Malaya Subs do a lot of burst, and yeah they can look bad on the meters but still be good
[1:58:35] Roensoul: BM is the only here doig dmg to armor. 🙂
[1:58:44] El_Malaya: ty guys :D
[1:59:01] skez_live: ret damage is looking nice
[1:59:19] PastaSeat: lot of pet cleave, so it's inflated
[1:59:26] lordelenath: looks like ret won the patch lottery
[1:59:52] leeka: @lordelenath again
[2:00:02] klittconny: Ven actually looks tanky
[2:00:10] famous1939: ret out there giving precog, chasing druid, hoj'ing druid in bear and still going him
[2:00:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: This is the dawning of Retpocalypse 2.0, once the YouTube videos go out and people figure out how to meta it...
[2:00:18] rizzer_tv: LMAO ven you look like you want to kick a fat kid in Kmart right now
[2:00:20] Taevenx: LOL that baby LoH
[2:00:24] kreyzy8: KEKW
[2:00:25] oblivion819: can you feel armor changes?
[2:00:28] famous1939: this lobby playing more like a 1.3 than 2.3
[2:00:31] nightmxz: Those 5% rdruid nerfs hitting hard
[2:00:31] PastaSeat: good thing the Ret BoP'd you at full HP when the druid wasn't in CC
[2:00:33] micaiasf: that loh was so funny
[2:00:34] oblivion819: mage especially?
[2:00:35] privx: why do these druids play so far from your port
[2:00:37] kreyzy8: ya the lay did like 10% of your health lmao
[2:00:37] tedo781: healthstones!!!!
[2:00:41] Shway1013: but you have all that armor now
[2:00:45] drmattydubs: how does the armor change feel?  you’re not feeling it at all?
[2:00:46] Mrshmyt: STONES
[2:00:47] shaynk: healthstones OP
[2:00:50] clicket: how does it feel to be on an unkillable god class with all that armor
[2:00:55] lordelenath: after watching you still getting spanked by cleaves im not feeling the login on my aff lock tomorrow tbh
[2:00:57] johnnyQT: yeah all that armor against dks now
[2:00:59] michaelss_: how much armor do u have
[2:01:00] johnnyQT: sick
[2:01:01] johnnyQT: lol
[2:01:02] filtertips: conq farm is uncap now?
[2:01:11] Eckosaurus: lock actually has less armor because of talent changes
[2:01:14] chubmax: anyone tried out demo?
[2:01:19] JSaucy_v1: can't fear the pets while bestial wrath is up
[2:01:24] BMaStream: I got a 6-0 as demo today
[2:01:24] chubmax: wait seriously
[2:01:27] chubmax: lock has LESS armor?
[2:01:41] Smexxin: no, it doesnt
[2:01:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: 20 pets in a match seems a bit excessive to me, but some people really love their pets
[2:01:53] matri1987: NPC specs are total garbage
[2:02:04] tarth_100: yep
[2:02:05] Moobot: Latest video "PvP Rewards Are Still Too Hard To Get In Dragonflight, Data Shows" view it here: youtu.be/NSw9Imk5bec
[2:02:12] nightmxz: UA does a % though so it would be same no?
[2:02:16] lordelenath: when can we ban BM hunter and demo lock from the game? i hate npc specs
[2:02:21] tarth_100: health going up means its easier to dispel Ua
[2:02:22] boundric: true. the ret playing dispell judge and not caring about UA
[2:02:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Disable treants in arena, imo
[2:03:01] skez_live: haha
[2:03:34] chubmax: i guess i should try demo
[2:03:36] chubmax: is it really that good?
[2:03:40] chubmax: @Smexxin so lock has more armor?
[2:03:49] anacronz: @venruki are you gonna try sp also?
[2:03:53] BIuffwatcher: They should giver every spec some AI pets
[2:03:55] Shaytimes: lmao hurts to look at
[2:04:06] Nitsud97: fucking zoo on you..
[2:04:12] lordelenath: looking at the demon armor last-minute change, lock probably has the same or less armor then pre-patch, right?
[2:04:17] kreyzy8: the first and last aff que of the patch LUL
[2:04:23] chubmax: i have like 6.5k armor in combat
[2:04:26] chubmax: on my dmeo
[2:04:29] atomic_gossipgirlxo: 30min for healer to grief 3 rounds in a row and then afk. Fun!
[2:04:29] matri1987: they have slightly more
[2:04:38] Synckery: @chubmax because of the changes locks end up with about 0.3% more armour
[2:04:41] IsaiahFrank: Pretty horrible lobby for afflic lol. As least feign death doesn't remove dots anymore.
[2:04:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: I heard that lock has slightly more armor after all the changes, but I'm not a math person
[2:04:45] lordelenath: I had 6.2 or 6.3k on my lock yesterday in pvp cmbat.
[2:04:48] BIuffwatcher: haha
[2:04:48] kreyzy8: :(
[2:04:49] lordelenath: so thats basically the same
[2:04:53] Boruox: WOW
[2:04:54] dmicrl: LMAO
[2:04:55] chubmax: ok so its jsut more hp
[2:04:56] micaiasf: 1000 yards grip
[2:04:56] leeka: looks wonderful
[2:04:56] BIuffwatcher: GET HERE!
[2:04:58] smitesucks: i dont know why you are surprised. Bm and dh didnt get touched. and they reverted the lock armor buff
[2:05:00] chubmax: lmao
[2:05:02] Taevenx: nerf ret
[2:05:04] Flormaat: arena will be so annoying now
[2:05:04] parade25: i hate dks so much
[2:05:05] SplitViewAskew: poor aff :(
[2:05:07] mat4th: not sure I believe you're trying your best. you definitely can kite a bajillion pets and cast all your spells without being interrupted better than you are
[2:05:07] IsaiahFrank: Lmao
[2:05:08] Deftpro: Hey @venruki i was watching an old Reckful Vod and caught him looking at old pictures of his wow screenshots on imgur and i managed to get the link, you're in one or 2 of them if you'd like the link :) Sorry if someone else has already done this and sent you them before!
[2:05:09] heymomimonttv: ye play destro
[2:05:11] Shway1013: demo/destro is far superior
[2:05:14] belvedee: looked fun Kappa
[2:05:19] Boruox: that grip was perf
[2:05:21] anacronz: Sp?
[2:05:25] boundric: rsham!
[2:05:31] mat4th: definitely being sarcastic btw
[2:05:34] chubmax: @havenblood litereally 0 changed
[2:05:35] primejusticegaming: yo what up ven
[2:05:38] didgeridoo1001: Demo or nothing now?
[2:05:39] primejusticegaming: hows lock feeling
[2:05:39] chubmax: 10% more stam
[2:05:42] heymomimonttv: saw trille play a solo lobby with demo and destro and boomy in it and aff was easily worst lock spec
[2:05:55] chubmax: lock armor is exactly the same lol
[2:06:04] kloudykloudd: just ate a ham and cheese on toasted honey wheat with mayo & bread and butter pickles with chicken and sausage gumbo and that shit was FIRE
[2:06:10] leeka: BM hunter does
[2:06:13] heymomimonttv: all 3 lock specs in the same lobby, aff was easily the worst and he was so tilted lmao
[2:06:14] crazzbez: except bm
[2:06:16] chubmax: no I mean i had 6.2k yesterday and 6.3k today
[2:06:20] Aroty: It's such a troll spec
[2:06:29] jheas1: @leeka lock still has more armor than BM
[2:06:30] What_ln_Tarnation: we love seeing locks not get changes
[2:06:30] kreyzy8: yeah Chan said he had 1 or 2% more armor
[2:06:34] eMBeaR64oz: armor just doesnt matter as much as ppl think
[2:06:36] kreyzy8: so like 0.5% reduction
[2:06:39] Synckery: it is almost exactly the same, Leeka did the math, PRE patch armour was 19.65% now its 19.88%
[2:06:40] anon9753: The multi-dot and rot win condition is dead in current WoW. Aff just needs a single target PvP build and a second spell school to be good again.
[2:06:41] Taevenx: I think Mes did the math and locks still got a lil buff
[2:06:46] Synckery: its literally 0.23% more armor
[2:06:53] lundbergmackan: @venruki Do you think holy priest buff is going to be significant ?
[2:06:55] zachgamegodx: @Taevenx na MATH
[2:07:04] ALLtheEXP: Smexual is a good name
[2:07:04] leeka: @Synckery yeah i gained 160 armor as demo
[2:07:12] FreddoB: hello, is this the world of demolock and ret?
[2:07:20] pvalue01: still more playable than feral, Sadge
[2:07:29] Slayer_Eagleone: so is retail even more dead now or is it alive again?
[2:07:29] Synckery: yep @leeka your the boss for doing the math to show people the real facts
[2:07:30] ayalcoh1: Whats wrong with affli
[2:07:36] belvedee: 12.5% buff to armor for locks with demon armor (used to be 45% now 57.5%)
[2:07:38] rafaelnazarenus: Nice to see you play other classes.
[2:07:40] lundbergmackan: @Slayer_Eagleone bigger then ever
[2:07:49] willie_stroker_99: Imagine how Maldiva feels right now
[2:07:53] What_ln_Tarnation: @ayalcoh1 its not demo or destro
[2:08:22] Aroty: Maldiva doesn't even really play aff, sooo that tells you how sucky it is
[2:08:42] willie_stroker_99: That too 😂
[2:08:46] brewtank: @venruki now that I think about aff wrath you have a fire school to cast along with shadow. I hope they get a rework next xpac
[2:08:48] Slayer_Eagleone: dude devoker dmg seems kind of overtuned
[2:08:51] fistweaveurnan: @Aroty lol he plays it ALL THE TIME
[2:08:54] famous1939: dh isnt a thinking man's class
[2:08:56] BanthaBantha: ayo what
[2:09:03] ALLtheEXP: meta early is big st0nks
[2:09:14] Nachofez: i guess as a caster you gotta think and stuff and melee is zug zug
[2:09:19] joyrex_j9: its lasts so long lol
[2:09:19] eMBeaR64oz: just be sure to beam and dance first before meta for reset if talented
[2:09:23] famous1939: all gas no brakes
[2:09:23] dmicrl: did that warrior strength nerf go through?
[2:09:24] Aroty: @fistweaveurnan really? Every time I watch it's destro
[2:09:36] shitywok: i think ur react vid to the upcoming class changes saying warlock are new gods got them last min nerfs
[2:09:37] Blitzylive: ya DH winning is just press every button
[2:09:43] Blitzylive: no thinking allowed
[2:09:43] dmicrl: thx
[2:09:43] salv_za: double blade and eye is great
[2:09:52] BlackHavoc: ''Learn how to play DH'' Sooo much to learn Kappa
[2:10:00] ALLtheEXP: you gotta think a lil' bit for DH
[2:10:05] What_ln_Tarnation: wars lost 30% armor and got 45% armor to teeth buff, so they prob got dam buff
[2:10:14] ALLtheEXP: remember what skillcapped says, all DHs are gonna do similar dam, gotta think about timing CC to win :)
[2:10:16] biofreaks: The game feels the same so far.
[2:10:24] DoYouWannaHug: I gained .6 Physical dmg reduction on my lock
[2:10:25] primejusticegaming: DH does so much dmg
[2:10:26] Locturnal_TV: im just excited to see outlaw rogue get some time in the sun
[2:10:26] Badasti: Ven is the dev whisperer

[2:11:18] Taevenx: that's big dam
[2:11:21] Blitzylive: 200k bite?
[2:11:23] tengeoff: @heymomimonttv whats youre spce?
[2:11:28] 3KuLTV: ferals good in pvp? o.O
[2:11:29] brewtank: @venruki you need to rename one of your chars to “Victimclass” lol. from the vid yesterday
[2:11:29] dropbombsss: absolute banger of a song
[2:11:32] BlackHavoc: Where is the patch notes?
[2:11:32] anacronz: Play destro

[2:11:44] shitywok: just own ppl on mage
[2:11:45] tengeoff: @heymomimonttv noice noice GL brother
[2:11:49] salv_za: I thought feral was terrible
[2:11:55] FreddoB: is DH more fun than monk in your opinion?
[2:12:14] ALLtheEXP: i have too much fun on DH
[2:12:19] ALLtheEXP: it's annoying
[2:12:25] anacronz: Most fun melee class?
[2:12:30] brewtank: @venruki you need to rename one of your chars to “Victimclass” lol. from the vid yesterday
[2:12:30] kaznab: why did blizzard stop making amazing weapons like those?
[2:12:31] heymomimonttv: holy shit dh just killed itself dispelling UA lmfaoooo
[2:12:34] man0litos: Sub rogue
[2:12:43] dmicrl: Most important question how are Sub Rogues?
[2:12:47] BlackHavoc: I've had problems picking a class/spec for so long, I tried WW monk and im currently hooked man, They are super fun
[2:12:55] Sixxtylol: @heymomimonttv I did that before lmfao I forgot I had the dispel pvp talent on
[2:12:57] Ernanz: LUL what bro..
[2:12:58] Ernanz: wow
[2:13:00] halcyonwow: feral just a rogue that dies lol
[2:13:00] Synckery: especially when assa is good
[2:13:03] Blitzylive: they need to give instant cyclone back to feral
[2:13:03] kaounallah: the only circumstance is jungle
[2:13:08] Synckery: because assa does everything feral does and better
[2:13:12] ALLtheEXP: That tells me they need to redesign feral druid as a class. Maybe make it more unique than a cat-skinned Rogue
[2:13:12] rembrandt89: god no
[2:13:13] brewtank: @halcyonwow true lol
[2:13:34] x9nwc: all u have to do to beat ferel is kick clones BuddhaBar
[2:13:35] Ernanz: No chat you suck lmfao, you can't be a good Feral just say it don't compare it to other classes
[2:13:39] Ernanz: Boomers
[2:13:43] pvalue01: feral's defense is a joke
[2:13:54] SteLawBro: Ferals for the hipsters who dont want to play a "3 button class"..."Lok at all my abilities bro, 🤓 "
[2:14:01] Sixxtylol: they gave feral better regrowths or something
[2:14:14] pvalue01: and feral damage is still worse than dh, ret etc
[2:14:36] Sixxtylol: feral p fun but still falls short yea
[2:14:37] FreddoB: Im leveling warrior now then monk
[2:15:01] Sosatko: Was playin this comp yesterday it slaps so hard lol
[2:15:03] ALLtheEXP: only after you eyebeam
[2:15:04] Sosatko: just so much dam
[2:15:05] ALLtheEXP: for demon form
[2:15:06] rikolte: guys whats the name of the addon that writes everything for you on the screen?
[2:15:07] salv_za: essence break has shorter cd?
[2:15:23] deltrexx: THE RETS HAVE BEEN RELEASED CAUTION
[2:15:29] ALLtheEXP: right, probably don't waste it if you're not in demon form for blades etc.
[2:15:31] eainzsp: just more dam than god
[2:15:32] What_ln_Tarnation: i hate having my essence broken Sadge

[2:15:54] Cephqt: what counters rets?
[2:15:58] Mcaveryst: rets still die its like playing russian roulette either u shoot him in the head or he shoots you sometimes
[2:15:58] Cephqt: rogues?
[2:16:32] chaps_86: actually rets are pretty good into rogues
[2:16:39] chaps_86: casters counter ret
[2:16:51] shitywok: you should try SP
[2:17:00] DrWarz: @venruki BLIZZ SHOULD REALLY NERF rogues defensive toolkit lol they always have an answer
[2:17:19] BulkyManticore: what conquest gear do you guys buy first?
[2:17:27] ALLtheEXP: the expensive ones
[2:17:31] brewtank: @drwarz they need that.. LUL
[2:17:41] BulkyManticore: what about tier set pieces, isnt that a waste?
[2:17:51] chaps_86: bubble/block/swap
[2:18:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: With the conquest cap lifted, and spoils of war buff, it doesn't matter as much in what order you get gear
[2:18:01] dankgamer97: Played mage ? How does cloth armor buff feel on mage ?
[2:18:10] ALLtheEXP: mage got got
[2:18:12] Blitzylive: i swear DH is the new huntard
[2:18:35] ALLtheEXP: DH / Destro has been my favorite 3's comp this season
[2:18:44] southparkbbb: spriest definitely feels more tanky
[2:18:46] boostgold7: think dh is the only class you can be awful on and still perform the best
[2:18:51] shitywok: you have to play the same class a couple hours to get in the groove of it

[2:18:58] logikol: are u going to play any casters?
[2:19:01] rembrandt89: nah BM is still the lowest of iq
[2:19:08] lightsflux: true
[2:19:13] peacant: like mage lol
[2:19:14] pisceslonewolf: They're called melee
[2:19:16] brewtank: @venruki how much is mage armor buffed by? solid?
[2:19:22] Locturnal_TV: bm is one of them. you can hold a 60% win/loss without having trap on your bars
[2:19:23] peacant: a bad mage literally does nothing
[2:19:25] obstata: DH has to the the best example of that tho
[2:19:26] tarth_100: bm cough
[2:19:44] Mimfy: haven't logged in yet...how's the armor buff/nerf feeling?
[2:19:44] JmanOwnz: ngl but I think devo is insane now
[2:19:46] rembrandt89: 4 set is super broken too
[2:19:55] pisceslonewolf: 4-set is whatever
[2:20:08] pisceslonewolf: 2-set is the thing
[2:20:13] Texdizzle: closer to a backstab but your point remains
[2:20:18] armin_ed: How do rogues feel currently?
[2:20:21] rembrandt89: nah 4 set is broken
[2:20:23] Badasti: for some reason blizzard decided some classes don't need weaknesses
[2:20:26] ryanblue98: warriors always best end of expansion?
[2:20:31] Synckery: ice lance automatically casts a instant frostbolt
[2:20:34] chaps_86: @armin_ed all 3 rogues are great
[2:20:38] FreddoB: i like punishing myself playing enhance
[2:20:40] ZoomRiots: everytime you mortal strike you rend
[2:20:43] Texdizzle: well its also super op because if you dont have any glaive charges it still throws a glaive
[2:20:47] salv_za: and also bounces to the next target
[2:20:51] sbrees: Every time you meatball you thunder bolt
[2:20:51] Texdizzle: so it also creates a charge of said spell
[2:20:58] sourbutts: everytime you pyroblast, cast another pyroblast for free, and get another proc
[2:21:04] Mcaveryst: dont they need more set bonuses like that though? change the way the game is played from both sides
[2:21:14] ihavesmokedcrack: Everything you flameshock you lava blast would be nice
[2:21:40] ALLtheEXP: is that one of those backhanded compliments like "yours is perfect, the big ones hurt"
[2:21:44] dougdimaddome: no lol
[2:21:51] euthelol: problem is when some set bonuses are great and some arent worth taking at all
[2:21:55] AdamHeron12: what class has the worst set bonus in your opinion?
[2:21:56] tmoney9018: who’s peef? it’s not piffzors is it?
[2:22:10] rembrandt89: I want monk to strike of the windlord everytime I rsk
[2:22:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure they are not close to equal. The spec I like most has a lousy set bonus that relies on a talent I don't like to use
[2:22:19] boostgold7: didnt mop have seperate pvp and pve sets with bonuses if i remember right?
[2:22:27] Squantanimo: frost increases glacial dam too right?
[2:22:57] buffevoker: Are the changes in
[2:23:10] jdot117: is ur healer smexxin?
[2:23:46] urack: @venruki i know you just started, but any thought about holy priest?
[2:24:22] nerdyorc_: where is Retribuki?
[2:24:52] peacant: do you think arcane assass is a good variant of rmp?
[2:25:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: @nerdyorc_ Retribuki was holy last time I saw it
[2:25:07] sourbutts: @peacant or RMD
[2:25:13] XxGarthakxX: I like being the dragon in arenas doing dragon stuff to ppl

[2:26:29] tmoney9018: who is the dragon you’re playing with?
[2:26:44] turkeybaster9: Peef
[2:26:50] Cephqt: dk self healing took a hit
[2:26:54] Cephqt: esp with armor reduction
[2:26:55] witchcvlt: doesnt feel that dif at like 2300 mmr shuffle
[2:26:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the high rated 3's are where we will see the meta defined
[2:26:58] Cephqt: unholy at least
[2:27:04] tmoney9018: I know a piff so just curious
[2:27:09] chaps_86: did lock still get an armor increase after the late nerf?
[2:27:12] kingcamps_alot: feels like its time to dragon main
[2:27:37] Bonegraft: anyone have a link to the eyebeam build?
[2:27:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shadow priest didn't look so tough that time!

[2:28:02] Grimey_George: you cant kick eye beam anymore
[2:28:03] kingcamps_alot: this song to dh kills is kinda fire
[2:28:08] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man
[2:28:11] rembrandt89: it just cancels eye beam
[2:28:12] turkeybaster9: mvenq
[2:28:17] salv_za: I think it used to be possible to kick
[2:28:22] zachgamegodx: are we worried for the holy paladins against dh Ioutlaw

[2:29:02] salv_za: you get fury either way
[2:29:06] Dwilk20: you primarily use it to build fury
[2:29:11] Dwilk20: but if you can hit people you want to
[2:29:16] cdewx: HOW DOES THE GAME FEEL VEN
[2:29:18] xilyx2: thats dh in a nutshell
[2:29:21] Dwilk20: It is primarily a Fury builder

[2:30:48] ATHLTE: hpriest*

[2:35:44] Metaphors: how do the changes feel
[2:35:50] hank_williams_senior_: how do you get details death log to show everything after 100% life
[2:35:57] morrs: I blinked and the next moment xD
[2:35:58] hank_williams_senior_: mine sometimes only shows like 30% to death
[2:35:59] urack: He talked with pala of the other arena
[2:36:12] ryanblue98: @storm_chaser_ron i do fine with the conquest gear which is supposed to be used for pv

[2:37:56] Hozitojones: nunruki POGGERS
[2:37:58] nikthevoker: LETS GO
[2:38:02] kaza_bialaruska: Venruki went the way of Demon Hunter. betrayed the brotherhood of the RDD. He's playing for our enemy!
[2:38:08] dmicrl: incoming double swap memes :D
[2:38:16] Grimey_George: Removing Damnation from shadow priest was the biggest fail imo. Miss that ability
[2:38:20] exarby: can u explain the changes? havent been playing retail
[2:38:34] Secretwombatbro: just steal some
[2:38:58] shogun2022: what are the big takeaways from people who have arena'd today, there a big shift in the meta now?
[2:39:00] leibowitzr10: q'd as healer by accident
[2:39:15] shogun2022: damn
[2:39:18] Secretwombatbro: rets do good meter damage
[2:39:18] rekt1370: the meta is the same maybe priest moved up
[2:39:35] ZealotryTV: EZ
[2:39:36] Oneminute: who would have thought
[2:39:36] pisceslonewolf: Baiting hard
[2:39:37] shogun2022: yeah rets were already pretty strong dps wise
[2:39:39] stoop__city: is that Lindsey sterling
[2:39:39] nikthevoker: FIGURES
[2:39:40] SirSion: really?
[2:39:43] Grimey_George: Have you faced a ret with the legendary weapon yet?
[2:39:43] What_ln_Tarnation: rets were only like the 4th best melee spec, blizz couldnt have that
[2:39:44] rekt1370: hope people play ret EZ WINS
[2:39:51] jmonttheking: DH and ret feels broken
[2:39:52] logikol: can i have the talent build?
[2:40:05] pisceslonewolf: your chat believes you ven
[2:40:08] pisceslonewolf: Stahp
[2:40:12] phanabananana: Rets die even easier
[2:40:15] venruki: BIQA0Hr2WRGgVq7/s2iQ2HhjlESiAAAAAAAAAAAAAgIpIplENFJJJJRSLgIJJkSkCJCkSJQC0QC
[2:40:17] rekt1370: yea that build ass
[2:40:18] ihavesmokedcrack: I love rats being op! All these idiots can't use the support paladins have so they are useless
[2:40:28] Secretwombatbro: oh void bolt is gonna be awesome with 30% pl
[2:40:33] What_ln_Tarnation: @phanabananana no they dont, stam buff offset it
[2:40:41] shogun2022: I just played a couple games on my dk and I felt like I was dying so quickly
[2:40:49] Secretwombatbro: catharsis is technically buffed
[2:41:15] rekt1370: dev is just bonkers LUL
[2:41:17] What_ln_Tarnation: did disc get dam boost?
[2:41:23] hank_williams_senior_: hober smexxin dmg in details pls
[2:41:25] johnnyQT: WELL THAT SETTLES IT SP IS BACK
[2:41:25] hank_williams_senior_: hover
[2:41:31] Ernanz: Dev got a massive buff or something?
[2:41:33] Dwilk20: Rets should get the Spriest treatment. Sanc should be a 2min cool down and a 1.5sec long cast time to use
[2:41:33] Ernanz: whats going on
[2:41:36] hank_williams_senior_: o
[2:41:46] rekt1370: dev been doing insane damage
[2:41:48] Blitzylive: you gonna try holy buff spec?
[2:41:49] southparkbbb: spriest literally feels unkillable
[2:41:52] ShaHugs: comparing sanc and mass dispel is so fried lol
[2:41:58] What_ln_Tarnation: why is it that rain from above is CC'able but not ulti penance?
[2:42:05] celipra86: For some reason, I almost didn't recognize you... look skinny in the face . Might just be my screen lol
[2:42:07] southparkbbb: wizk going to have a fiesta in the AWC
[2:42:07] rekt1370: cant wait to face 2 melees as s priest prob feels nice Kappa
[2:42:07] NomFries: what's the front of that mount look like
[2:42:08] Blitzylive: what defensive buffs did spriest get?
[2:42:09] himpnote: @southparkbbb sotp the cap
[2:42:13] shogun2022: im gonna get shit on today I can just feel it
[2:42:17] southparkbbb: @pjc_tv not capping
[2:42:21] Shway1013: shadow is always the better aff lock
[2:42:24] GuyVigor: what buffs did ret get?
[2:42:25] xilyx2: we'll see
[2:42:29] Synckery: people saying spriest is unkillable ... how can the armor make it from the weakest spec in the game to unkillable lol
[2:42:30] rekt1370: sp is legit a terrible lock
[2:42:32] azrothlol: is 15% haste good?
[2:42:33] himpnote: @southparkbbb playing spriest rn
[2:42:38] x9nwc: who is most OP after todays changes?
[2:42:47] 인터넷포트: Were live boys in Patch 10.2.5 PTR with some retail PvP! Lets Goooooooooo
[2:42:55] firemarcosrl: i just lost as mage 1 vs 1 against holy preist lol shit's hitting 140k lol with something
[2:42:56] ImJordanHi: Is this Pokemonz build?
[2:43:11] pisceslonewolf: DH/Rogue
[2:43:11] nuckAU: Ret seems ok now
[2:43:11] stealthwalker99: sub rouge still
[2:43:16] What_ln_Tarnation: bm hunter looking op
[2:43:19] rekt1370: rogue still best class
[2:43:22] firemarcosrl: @What_ln_Tarnation it's OP tlolol
[2:43:22] fistweaveurnan: dev evoker
[2:43:25] rekt1370: like always
[2:43:26] Superbawk: It's rets
[2:43:40] firemarcosrl: @Superbawk ret's okay lol
[2:43:54] Flokko: RETS BROKEN!!!!! AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2:43:55] rekt1370: people see rets get 10 percent to verdict and say they broken
[2:44:06] firemarcosrl: @rekt1370 x2 lol
[2:44:22] korgare: Evoker lookin fuckin nutty
[2:44:27] pisceslonewolf: Ret was the least played dps class before this btw
[2:44:38] fistweaveurnan: love to see that statistic
[2:44:39] ShaHugs: no it wasn't lol
[2:44:41] Synckery: ??? thats just not true?
[2:44:43] What_ln_Tarnation: cant ever talk bad about rets cuz 40% of the playerbase play paladin and will get on your throat
[2:44:55] pisceslonewolf: It is. If you combine the multiple dps spec classes
[2:45:01] southparkbbb: xD
[2:45:03] fistweaveurnan: still isnt
[2:45:14] pisceslonewolf: It was when I checked a couple weeks back
[2:45:18] fistweaveurnan: no it wasnt
[2:45:26] pisceslonewolf: Yes
[2:45:30] pisceslonewolf: you are not God
[2:45:32] kazekwow: I'm so excited to get back on my priest after work
[2:45:36] ShaHugs: you can't just combine multiple dps specs and act like that's a statistic
[2:45:37] dinoman78: is fear a stun now?
[2:45:48] pisceslonewolf: @ShaHugs It is A statistic
[2:45:52] pragma90: see, if sp wasnt unkillable you would have died
[2:46:00] Bluguieghe: how is the game after the chamges?
[2:46:09] Synckery: @pisceslonewolf in the last 72 hours theres been 9000 more rets play than even WW monks
[2:46:10] dtbmar: yooo gg lol
[2:46:11] dmicrl: holy viable?
[2:46:15] rekt1370: want to see dh dk vs s prriest see how fun it is LUL
[2:46:16] ShaHugs: @pisceslonewolf no it's not, ret isn't a class and dps isn't a class either
[2:46:18] johnnyQT: yes
[2:46:18] rekt1370: phase shift is amazing
[2:46:20] anacronz: Play ghost build is 20% more damage
[2:46:25] rekt1370: mandatory
[2:46:29] Buleh: Catharsis is soo broken
[2:46:47] pisceslonewolf: @ShaHugs Ok. Pseudo intellectuals winning out there
[2:47:08] Synckery: I mean you can check on drustvar the stats
[2:47:09] pisceslonewolf: @Synckery Ye well when I/we checked was not the last 72 hours.
[2:47:14] gdodmebxu: @ShaHugs i mean he's not wrong. ret isn't a class KEKW
[2:47:24] gdodmebxu: it's a spec Kappa
[2:47:31] pisceslonewolf: @gdodmebxu Ofc not
[2:47:40] Synckery: im just saying if you say stuff like that with authority and then dont have the stats to back it up its a bit pepega
[2:47:47] leibowitzr10: okay fear is a low key stun. got it
[2:48:09] pisceslonewolf: @Synckery Yo. Just let me search the databases for the exact date a couple weeks back when I checked. Just for you
[2:48:11] cixelp: so it's looking like priests aren't gonna be able to death fear anymore :P
[2:48:24] Synckery: @pisceslonewolf please do would love to see!
[2:48:26] willcabs: willcabs subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! flying In the air during the 19 monther!
[2:48:31] rekt1370: yea mastery sucks on sp
[2:48:37] noggysipples: when you gonna do the next tierlist?
[2:48:43] kreyzy8: wiz had 46% haste on his SP lol
[2:48:47] figurines: run the no casting build probably
[2:48:47] kreyzy8: when I was watching him earlier
[2:48:47] rekt1370: low haste sp is the worst ever
[2:48:54] Kataemoi: Hey man, u prefer retail pvp compared to SoD or WOTLK?
[2:48:56] johnnyQT: Mastery jsut isnt good for sp either tho
[2:48:58] johnnyQT: doesnt help
[2:49:00] SirSion: best healer for mage/rogue atm?
[2:49:14] johnnyQT: Shame it does do something better
[2:49:14] Chappypappy1: bruing templates back
[2:49:14] rekt1370: druid or priest for magerogue
[2:49:20] Bluguieghe: is priest good  now?:P
[2:49:22] rekt1370: both equal
[2:49:25] cixelp: so mastery is fine, especially if you play but insidious ire, but haste just helps so much on pretty much any caster right now
[2:49:32] pragma90: or go half mastery/half haste and be mediocre at both
[2:49:42] Metaphors: they almost did it there
[2:49:53] pisceslonewolf: @Synckery I suppose the only spec that could give Ret a run for it's money in THAT statistic is Spriests. That's just how it works out when most classes at least one strong DPS spec and these classes have 1 fairly weak spec.
[2:49:55] skeletonj3lly: lmao dev dmg
[2:50:04] Cephqt: holy shit, dev damage is something else
[2:50:17] jakestewie: rukiCool
[2:50:24] chancywilson: any noticeable changes???
[2:50:44] stealthwalker99: You should see this rets dam in my shuffle. I think he could even out dps pokemons
[2:50:46] azrothlol: Is that piff the Magic Dragon?
[2:50:50] macielmpr: @venruki what is the best race for ally monk?
[2:51:00] reczy__: Is the fear change noticeable?
[2:51:00] What_ln_Tarnation: yes
[2:51:13] nikthevoker: buff devoker
[2:51:14] nuckAU: Ret looks decent again
[2:51:21] Vulvayer: A HOLY CRUSADE
[2:51:24] rekt1370: yea go try ret sure you will have a good time Kappa
[2:51:25] What_ln_Tarnation: ret meta is cancer meta
[2:51:27] tibbey_1: Does the game feel any different today?
[2:51:27] ihavesmokedcrack: Ret was shit! So you add 20% dps to shit! It's still a turd just a shiny one
[2:51:28] KralHor: ret decent? noice
[2:51:30] GuyVigor: What did they change about ret?
[2:51:35] nikthevoker: YOU WONT!
[2:51:36] storm_chaser_ron: dam buffs
[2:51:44] rekt1370: 10 percent to verdict is any real change
[2:51:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: For science!
[2:51:46] chancywilson: @tibbey_1 I asked the same thing /shrug
[2:51:49] rekt1370: blade of justice buff is hilarious
[2:51:52] flawfox: saw some insane ret numbers 100k plus constant dps earlier @venruki
[2:51:56] pisceslonewolf: TLDR: Ret was high B-tier and now it's high A-tier.
[2:52:14] sk0g_i: How is mage? Warlock? :) I Enjoy my mage more but warlock feels alot better, but how is it after the patch? Is mage good?
[2:52:15] mat4th: for the love of peef
[2:52:15] salv_za: for the love of peef
[2:52:17] ihavesmokedcrack: 20% buff to ability that hits 30k lol massive buffs lol
[2:52:28] salv_za: ah beat me to it @mat4th
[2:52:29] rekt1370: replace a ret with a war dh dk in any of their comps and its 10x better LUL
[2:52:29] shogun2022: dat peef
[2:52:39] mayonaes: why there is a cast time on VT still is beyond me
[2:53:00] KralHor: lock just standing while taking 0 dmg
[2:53:22] pisceslonewolf: @KralHor He says while lock is hovering at 10% hp :P
[2:53:23] mayonaes: Remove cast time from VT and remove the talent that combines VT and pain
[2:53:33] mayonaes: so i can just instant cast both
[2:53:33] stealthwalker99: The ret did 125k dps over 5 min it's pretty decent
[2:53:34] gdodmebxu: @mayonaes Kappa
[2:53:39] cixelp: if you accidentally have too much mastery you might find it makes sense to lean into a heavy "go" build with dark ascension/insidious ire
[2:53:55] KralHor: @pisceslonewolf yeah, took time to write that :D
[2:53:56] cixelp: rather than sustain/rot
[2:54:19] ImJordanHi: Nothing Venruki loves more than a bit of good ole fashion RP on his Paladin
[2:54:19] mayonaes: lol no dots void torrent Kappa
[2:54:24] yowler_: SP feeling any different?
[2:54:27] exercisefreak: aight u prob got this question 100 times already but is the armor thingy noticable?
[2:54:28] Pock3tsand: bring back Spriest stealth and the class becomes viable again
[2:54:31] ooPickleRicKoo: s priest feeling nice
[2:54:35] mayonaes: it got the job done
[2:54:39] Vulvayer: its time for a holy crusade ven
[2:54:50] shogun2022: whats the best ret comp gonna be
[2:54:50] ZealotryTV: we are so back
[2:54:51] rekt1370: hell nah
[2:54:52] ItsBees: do it Pog

[2:54:57] Ernanz: play with Retribuki man
[2:54:58] hank_williams_senior_: all pvp streamers run ret till nerf
[2:55:06] mayonaes: Once you go RET you are all SET
[2:55:07] azrothlol: content
[2:55:10] ihavesmokedcrack: Ret dps is padded! It's useless are dmg
[2:55:13] NerdEngineering: @venruki Think this AWC season will be exciting?
[2:55:23] pisceslonewolf: @KralHor :)
[2:55:23] Goats48: true
[2:55:26] GuyVigor: BUff locks
[2:55:26] AdamHeron12: ret healing sucks ass
[2:55:28] rekt1370: @NerdEngineering  if you like rogue mage and rogue boomy yea LUL
[2:55:30] jakestewie: retribuki
[2:55:38] pisceslonewolf: Ret healing could use buffs indeed. DMG not as much
[2:55:45] Vulvayer: DIVINE JUSTICE
[2:55:45] shogun2022: alright fuck it going to gear ret
[2:55:46] allenlondon210: wizk was destroying rets earlier
[2:55:52] AdamHeron12: @pisceslonewolf Clap
[2:55:55] NerdEngineering: @rekt1370 I always assume Rogue is in the mix
[2:55:59] rekt1370: 90 percent of pure dps specs do more healing than ret LUL
[2:56:06] What_ln_Tarnation: pressing butts Pog
[2:56:06] ooPickleRicKoo: ret needs 100% damage buffs to all talents
[2:56:06] allenlondon210: demo/sp was doing work lol
[2:56:07] pisceslonewolf: @rekt1370 This
[2:56:12] Dwilk20: If Spriest is strong they can counter rets
[2:56:17] Dwilk20: cause they can remove all their stupid shit
[2:56:27] flawfox: Luckily you have a lot of win buttons Kappa
