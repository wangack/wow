[0:12:14] Zuldak: How did Kira get her name? Is she named after someone?
[0:12:34] itsparvati: major kira!
[0:12:39] itsparvati: from DS9
[0:12:42] Aseopp: Cute but deadly
[0:12:48] wolfcloudchaser80: Random fact: the singular form of phalanges is 'phalanx.'
[0:12:49] Zuldak: Star trek
[0:12:50] GreenArrowed: star trek
[0:12:54] itsparvati: OMG star trek!

[0:14:20] cashthb: startrek is old and smelly tho
[0:14:52] Kurama__95: Boomkin form could help LUL
[0:14:55] Minobard: I wish i could make a dragon like Sendrax (Opening big dragon warrior)
[0:15:16] cashthb: you could also work on the bloody coin mount!
[0:15:26] Lheela: do you still do the random transmog ATT farm thing?
[0:15:48] Kurama__95: Could level classes that you need for Order Hall mounts
[0:15:49] forebringer: She died
[0:15:54] Minobard: rip
[0:16:12] Zuldak: Uhh... she died saving that egg you took to alexstraza
[0:16:19] GreenArrowed: holding the line for us
[0:16:31] Kurama__95: She died really early in the campaign, was quite underwhelming LUL
[0:16:55] itsparvati: red shirt energy
[0:16:55] heldtheline: That was our first clue that she was doomed actually.
[0:16:56] Lheela: "was i there" asks the person who stood right beside her as she sacrificed herself
[0:17:19] cashthb: time for her to fet aotc
[0:17:25] Minobard: i got a 467 for doing the firelands raid - i had no clue that i gave that gear

[0:17:44] Zuldak: She was happy and having fun. It was detected by blizz and she didn't get past the first zone
[0:17:47] budapestppp: is it weird that you remind me of a young cate blanchett??
[0:17:55] jgbrit: Are timewalking raids a new thing?
[0:18:13] forebringer: 4.6 years is 56 months
[0:18:17] budapestppp: yesssss that exact image hahaha
[0:18:51] Zuldak: Lotr movie was 20 years ago...
[0:18:51] budapestppp: but she ages like a vampire
[0:19:09] itsparvati: love that woman, great talent
[0:19:17] budapestppp: ive just seen her in T√°r
[0:19:35] NamiWhami: I loved T√°r!
[0:19:56] cashthb: if she's so talented why wasn't she in Barbie?
[0:20:03] Zuldak: My must see upcoming movie is the second part of dune. Going to take my wife so she can fall asleep to it
[0:20:04] NamiWhami: a little long, but tells a good story of favoritism and how fast you can fall from your peak
[0:20:06] budapestppp: very unique movie, i think you would like it
[0:20:19] meth_aq: hey Hazel, last time I saw you, your hair was shaved. Are you wearing a wig?
[0:20:48] wolfcloudchaser80: !wig
[0:20:48] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:20:49] Octopixy1971: !wig
[0:20:49] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:20:50] GreenArrowed: i like it better than the 80s versions
[0:20:52] Zuldak: Oh you saw the Lynch dune? Sting in a speedo is great.
[0:21:05] GreenArrowed: don't worry about it
[0:21:13] GreenArrowed: you do not need to see it
[0:21:18] cashthb: the 80's versions were amazing, whacha on about?
[0:21:28] marbared: Was one of those things Sting in a speedo? :D
[0:21:40] Zuldak: I liked the 80s version.
[0:21:45] jgbrit: Erm, excuse me. Nightflame exclusively rides the love rocket NotLikeThis
[0:22:36] Zuldak: Oh, so partner is coming with the move.
[0:22:48] cashthb: just open your own cinema
[0:23:04] budapestppp: omg pls show the cat
[0:23:27] Zuldak: I learned that tabby cats have 5 pattern types
[0:24:04] itsparvati: oh boy
[0:24:05] GreenArrowed: so sneezy
[0:24:06] Octopixy1971: ahwww bless you Miss Kira
[0:24:08] Calaxandra: OOOO cute kitty sneezes!
[0:24:29] Zuldak: Classic, mackerel, spotted, ticked and patched. I think Kira is a mackerel.
[0:24:35] Aseopp: It has not aged well.
[0:24:36] itsparvati: 90s comedy just dont land anymore
[0:24:38] Aseopp: Nope
[0:24:47] budapestppp: altoholics anonymous next monday dont forget to show up this time
[0:25:04] itsparvati: that was the thing though, it always was mean
[0:25:10] itsparvati: they were a group of pyschos
[0:25:19] JackOnline: I just started playing again since Castle Nath, hit 70 last night, now im aimless lol. Not sure what to do next but im going to keep playing :D
[0:25:21] Lheela: the laugh tracks are just too much for me in 90s shows
[0:25:27] GreenArrowed: it hasn't aged well but i find it funny how very ny it is
[0:25:36] forebringer: somebody forgot the anonymous part
[0:25:37] GreenArrowed: not just bc it's set here but that is how a lot of people behave
[0:25:45] repugnaaz: Hi Hazel! What are you doing today?
[0:25:51] repugnaaz: Justy mounts?
[0:25:54] repugnaaz: Just*
[0:25:54] Aseopp: I watched Host last night. Strangely moving.
[0:25:58] cashthb: khm painkiller khm, 'cuse my throat
[0:26:06] Kurama__95: @JackOnline There's a lot of stuff you "can" do, but not much you "must" do if you just aim to get to endgame content
[0:26:23] budapestppp: the rescue, the best doc, its abt the thai kids stuck in that cave and how they got rescued
[0:26:37] jgbrit: You still running Hazeline's mission table?
[0:26:48] repugnaaz: Thats sweet! I remember back in BFA when I created a brewmaster (I only play tanks) and in my second m+ run of freehold with monk, I dropped the moun haha
[0:27:20] Kurama__95: @HazelNuttyGames Not sure if you remember (since it's been years), but to farm rep for Nat Pagle for the garrison fishing mount, do I need to fish on pools to get the Lunkers or can I just do it in open water?
[0:27:39] JackOnline: @Kurama__95 Just finished the chromie quest line with the murlocks, I did some WQ's, and i sat through an excruciating Fyrakk event lol. im just icon hopping on my map now
[0:27:56] sence_00: @Kurama__95 lunkers
[0:28:04] blizzmule: even super squirt leveling?
[0:28:06] sence_00: only from pools
[0:28:07] Aseopp: Just a quick correction. I watched "The Host" not "Host" 2 very different things
[0:28:09] cashthb: you can lay on hands yourself up to full with only 1 button press on pallies!
[0:28:17] budapestppp: also having like 20-30 alts means like an endless supply of dopamine hits :D
[0:28:29] sence_00: I still have more of those stinky fish to catch :(
[0:28:35] NiightWalkeer: Hello Hazel! is Timewalking giving decent xp for leveling?
[0:28:35] Kurama__95: Damn, I was hoping I could sit my ass in one spot and just fish mindlessly
[0:28:43] msmester1: hello
[0:29:13] msmester1: cata timewalking is so fast i got like 1 level every 20 minutes including waiting
[0:29:14] sence_00: @Kurama__95 the other thing you can do it fish in your garrison for the frozen rare lure and you sometimes get coins from the murloc it summons
[0:29:17] McScooterson: But you had to flex the red
[0:29:23] blizzmule: red water strider gang
[0:29:29] Kurama__95: @JackOnline You don't need to do the Fyrakk event at all, do the campaign and it'll land you around 420 ilvl and buy couple of trinkets from the AH and you're set for LFR and low keys
[0:29:38] Calaxandra: I remember those raids we used to have in people's garrisons for Nat rep
[0:29:48] McScooterson: I still remember that news video coming out
[0:30:06] JackOnline: @Kurama__95 sweet ty for the words, ya im trying to run keys again. i miss that
[0:30:08] Kurama__95: @sence_00 My concern is not the coins since I got a lot from farming the turtles, my issue is the rep, so lunkers is the only way
[0:30:14] cashthb: I still use them, need that +10% or what ground mount speed saddle for max efficiency
[0:30:30] repugnaaz: I dropped Goldenmane while leveling, all my luck went away that day
[0:30:45] Gurottesquex: A little late to stream but good morning Hazel and chat!! hazelWave hazelLove
[0:30:46] McScooterson: The water striders losing water walking
[0:30:51] cashthb: i think more than 6
[0:31:47] Kurama__95: @JackOnline It's super easy and fun to gear this season with the new upgrade system. It's worth the time to look it up since you haven't played since Nathria, but it's a much better gearing system than we had before
[0:31:48] jgbrit: Playlist says 500 news vids
[0:31:55] AmiYuy: I feel like it just was very poorly explained
[0:32:13] McScooterson: I've started doing my legion mission table again with the pet charm change
[0:32:49] Kurama__95: Most of that stuff is usually datamined info out of context that makes the community have a meltdown on public forums LUL
[0:32:59] goplacidly56: hazelWave
[0:33:15] cashthb: maybe the historian peeps leaked it and that's why they got laid of, blizzard on the long con
[0:33:22] AmiYuy: Make it account wide skills like flying
[0:33:23] McScooterson: But hazel, if they did that, what would everyone do with their herbing druid alts
[0:33:26] repugnaaz: Thats why I hated druids in shadowlands, mount form in the maw
[0:33:28] AmiYuy: With Warbands
[0:33:32] Kurama__95: They kinda did it with the talent tree for gathering proffesions where you just herb while mounted
[0:33:45] budapestppp: didnt Boy use to be a shadow priest?
[0:33:48] itsparvati: flight form is 100% better
[0:33:59] itsparvati: once you go druid main, you never go back
[0:34:04] cashthb: the mission is rare but it gives way more (~5 base + ~20 bonus compard to 5-6)
[0:34:55] Kretyn: :O What's that head piece on Hazeline?
[0:35:01] itsparvati: thats the rumor
[0:35:11] itsparvati: tali said soon
[0:35:15] McScooterson: Holly's twitter seemed to indicate
[0:35:16] sence_00: i heard we were supped to hear last week but the layoffs messed it up, so i hope this week!
[0:35:17] itsparvati: and he knows things
[0:35:22] cashthb: the voices in my head told me they'll add denuvo
[0:35:30] Aryv34: i saw a funny meme with the pirate skull flag on the timeline, where it meant the layoffs <. .>
[0:35:34] jgbrit: I told you yesterday, it's the end for someone üòÇ
[0:35:45] Kurama__95: WotLK Naxx priest tier
[0:35:58] Kretyn: Thank you!! Cloth only probs?
[0:36:31] Kurama__95: Priest only, but the T3 is cloth-wide if you can get a hold if one
[0:37:33] Deevo_Twitch: @hazelnuttygames have you ever tried elder scrolls online before?
[0:37:33] cashthb: daycare is really good for pet stones
[0:38:05] SalvadoraWoW: YAY!  I love it when I can catch a live!  Hello all
[0:38:10] Minobard: the box from FL also dropped a raid mount for my friend and a raid pet for me
[0:38:30] Minobard: i love it
[0:38:36] Deevo_Twitch: How do I get more dragons
[0:38:50] Deevo_Twitch: Would I have to do campaigns?
[0:38:53] Kurama__95: They're giving a lot of incentive for TW raids. Just the fact that it drops heroic level gear is kinda mind boggling
[0:39:03] Deevo_Twitch: Got it thanks
[0:39:07] SalvadoraWoW: Happy it's Friday
[0:39:32] chops6965: hello all
[0:39:41] Deevo_Twitch: Year going by fast
[0:39:47] Minobard: the trading post shield is cool to me
[0:40:07] JustFrogging: toadphHmm
[0:40:43] msmester1: sound like a bad trip lol
[0:40:45] itsparvati: hazel is a bit crazy
[0:40:45] cashthb: why would you run away into skyrim legendary edition?
[0:41:09] berdk1: why are u look like facking trogg from lockmodan bro
[0:41:10] GreenArrowed: sewer entrance by the made tower
[0:41:15] Marmoh: This Avril Lavigne vibe is incredible
[0:41:20] AmiYuy: hazelYikes
[0:41:23] Gurottesquex: Yes, you get to spend a lot of time going down to the sewers lol
[0:41:43] GreenArrowed: the violet citadel
[0:41:49] GreenArrowed: i always forget waht it's called
[0:42:02] Deevo_Twitch: Do you pvp?
[0:42:05] cashthb: that does kinda sounds like the dark brother hood, you sure you weren't playing skyrim?
[0:42:17] janahita: janahita subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! Time flies when we're having fun! Thanks for the years of content and hope you and your family are doing well!
[0:42:17] Streamlabs: janahita just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:42:38] marbared: Be aware that there's a stealth rogue waiting down there to kill you. At least he's always there for me (sewers)
[0:42:46] Deevo_Twitch: What's your ilvl for pvp gear
[0:43:05] itsparvati: you have to mod skyrim or its boring
[0:43:16] diarrhea_lad: APPARENTLY it's considered "unprofessional" to fall asleep at your desk, what baloney
[0:43:23] Marmoh: You're better than me, I can never make it past the carriage cutscene before Alt + F4-ing
[0:43:32] cashthb: you can't mod the boring out of skyrim
[0:43:33] Minobard: machoman dragon mod - best mod ever
[0:43:36] shoppeguy: shoppeguy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! thanks for all the YT content makes my Saturdays all the better!
[0:43:36] Streamlabs: shoppeguy just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:43:38] itsparvati: there is a massive mod that is basically a showroom of "all the things"
[0:43:38] sence_00: how do you get drake crests for your pvp gear upgrades? you have to pve?
[0:43:39] marbared: Thomas the Tank Engine mod definitely helps
[0:44:02] VanirElf: ooh what do ?
[0:44:16] cashthb: most old bethesda games have 60¬∞ fov, gotta go to console and type fov 90 every single time you start the game
[0:44:58] Kurama__95: WoW is a big issue for me, there's always something I want to do and I just don't play other games LUL
[0:45:13] sence_00: ok interesting i thought you wanted to up it
[0:45:31] diarrhea_lad: I like that they made the change for the pvp gear to not require rating when it only increased pve item level
[0:45:31] Kretyn: That's so interesting.  I get the same way with a lot of other games, I get bored.  But not with WoW...why is that? ü§î
[0:46:07] cupcakechaos013: well I dived back into wow and baby slept long enough for me to finish the emerald dream quest line. I‚Äôm so behind
[0:46:44] databob1: is that a new wig or just styled different? it's cute
[0:46:57] Ivan_all_Good: Thats a better entrance to the lock hall over there
[0:47:00] emerald27x: legion was the best expansion
[0:47:33] msmester1: this quest had big imp act LUL
[0:47:41] Ivan_all_Good: Theres a broken sewer grate on the wall
[0:47:46] Kurama__95: You can do a key for BRH now Kappa
[0:48:02] Marmoh: People talking about BFA nostalgia and I'm here like "I liked it from the start!"
[0:48:06] Zuldak: Oh it was ground hog day today. Didn't see his shadow
[0:48:13] Marmoh: Well maybe not the start, but most of it
[0:48:48] anne42: I liked BFA just fine
[0:48:51] msmester1: only part i liked about bfa is the quests and mechagon
[0:49:38] JustFrogging: toadphBoog toadphBoog toadphBoog
[0:49:38] Marmoh: I think BFA had the best pre-patch model of any expansion
[0:49:45] antohbe: the end of bfa was soo good
[0:49:51] antohbe: with corruptions and stuff
[0:50:04] Marmoh: War of Thorns and Siege of Lordaeron
[0:50:05] Oriosis: very that
[0:50:11] antohbe: exactly
[0:50:12] Kurama__95: Corruption was really fun, getting them, not so much
[0:50:13] GreenArrowed: i love corruptions
[0:50:14] jgbrit: Most of the time I'd rather watch you play WoW than play it myself. I log in, get overwhelmed with what to do and log out
[0:50:17] GreenArrowed: it was so fun in BGs
[0:50:21] itsparvati: i miss bfa bm hunter
[0:50:44] xaleen1: @jgbrit Me too!
[0:50:48] mcxoney: i really loved scenery in nyalotha its the prettiest raid ever
[0:50:55] Ryok: i never went nuts with corruptions i just went with the boring "tons of haste" because it was technically the best non rng gain... although i would've loved an insane infinite stars setup D:
[0:50:55] msmester1: avg shadow priest corruption enjoyer
[0:50:59] adalex__: I feel evil for saying this but I remember they removed pvp scaling at the end of BFA and I would be oneshotting newbies with my twilight dev + drestagath trinket. so fun LUL
[0:51:15] itsparvati: bfa was my fav post-wotlk
[0:51:16] McScooterson: Rude
[0:51:28] Kurama__95: I didn't like HoA or Azerite gear whatsoever, and I didn't even play before 8.3 where it was much more grindier to do stuff
[0:51:30] McScooterson: Oh well if no one was on
[0:52:36] itsparvati: having those alerts on saved our guild bank once, dude got hacked and we noticed his toons logging in and out
[0:52:41] Ryok: i think for the 3rd or 4th time this patch i've just seen a call to arms for dps for random hcs D: i didn't even know that was possible xD
[0:53:11] Zuldak: I find locks to be one of the harder classes to clear old content with. Kinda limited aoe
[0:53:45] Kretyn: @Ryok It's...super nice when that happens.  Free money and blast through a dungeon :)
[0:53:47] adalex__: I got a call from my dad today. He started doing mission table everyday the first week of BFA, only today has he finished all the meta achievement! There was one table mission he didn't get once for that many years. :O
[0:53:53] msmester1: now dragonriding is just so much better
[0:54:05] Ryok: the runes are like ~750-1000 gold each
[0:54:23] Zuldak: Yeah I did that as a tank. Basically a mercenary for blizz to run dungeons for groups
[0:54:24] McScooterson: I think it knows exactly which mission because I'm still waiting for it
[0:54:40] adalex__: I remember he'd go on mad rambles about "I just need Dancing with the Dark Rangers" evey time we met for dinner haha
[0:54:44] itsparvati: phone app is best for doing old tables
[0:54:46] GreenArrowed: i never finished those
[0:54:53] GreenArrowed: there were a few that would just never pop for me
[0:54:58] McScooterson: Yep! That's the one
[0:55:02] Zuldak: I miss the 5k gold reward blingtron vault from wod missions
[0:55:05] Ryok: i usually queue as tank whenever the call to arms for them pops up and just switch to havoc spec on my now 483 main xD
[0:55:21] adalex__: I think it's Azeroth At War achievements? He sent four seperate tickets in to Blizzard about it and every time they told him "Go check WoWhead" LUL
[0:55:22] Ryok: made a decent amount of gold from it since the gold sink mount ^^
[0:55:40] msmester1: i got 15k from a superbloom was mildy suprised

[0:57:11] Just_Aizla: Damn! what about those people having gold cap on 9 characters haha
[0:57:11] Zuldak: I'm excited for my far flung alts on random realms to be easily accessible now. I hate changing realms
[0:57:41] Just_Aizla: Logging in pressing B to find 89.000.000 gold in your bag haha :D
[0:57:59] msmester1: i wanted to que up for all lfr and got a notification that im doing that too fast wtf
[0:57:59] roxywilde: I would. grt hit by every one of those...
[0:58:02] adalex__: Blizzard saw players loved the boulders so much they made the snake boi temple in BFA LUL
[0:58:24] msmester1: im stuck on a new player realm Sadge
[0:58:28] McScooterson: Lol
[0:58:37] zannuss: Not gonna beat the timer at this rate
[0:58:38] Just_Aizla: Hazel, how many mounts you got? :D
[0:58:40] pinkpaws_: hiii
[0:58:49] Kurama__95: Voidwalker has a aoe dmg ability, helps with old content
[0:59:02] Just_Aizla: Thats quite a handful :O

[0:59:22] adalex__: felguard does too if you're demo!
[0:59:42] Zuldak: You could do HC right now if you wanted
[0:59:43] cashthb: I miss wildstar, wildstar was so fun
[0:59:48] jgbrit: Play it again.... I dare you HeyGuys
[0:59:59] Just_Aizla: You got the succubus skin for the Tomb of Sargeras dungeon? :D

[1:00:13] Just_Aizla: Cathredral of Eternal night :D

[1:00:39] eternitycrystal: classic gets very boring very fast
[1:00:48] Kurama__95: EXP-wise, level 42 is halfway through level 60 in Classic LUL

[1:05:54] Deevo_Twitch: @hazelnuttygames when  dragonflight release day 1 was rushing home to play. I was speeding on the highway and got a fat juicy ticket $300 plus points on my license. I was so HyPed to play dragonflight

[1:07:16] Deevo_Twitch: @ryok true
[1:07:37] Ryok: yeah i got one and just tried to give it to random horde until i found one who didn't have it yet xD
[1:08:08] McScooterson: Still need to do rifts on my hordey
[1:08:43] Kurama__95: They need to increase the number of frags we get on digs, the whole grind seems grueling
[1:08:44] ScatteRRealmS: Are you farming love rocket next week or do you have it already?
[1:08:53] Zuldak: Yeah I'm doing once a week archive plus wqs for em.
[1:09:06] Deevo_Twitch: Do you stream variety games?
[1:09:08] Ujai321: off stream as well
[1:09:15] roxywilde: oh god...love rocket farm again? feels too soon
[1:09:46] Deevo_Twitch: Will you streak GTA 6 on release?
[1:09:52] Deevo_Twitch: Stream
[1:10:02] Kurama__95: At least Love Rocket farm is just once a day since they buffed the droprate
[1:10:08] cashthb: how about some vice city?
[1:10:15] Ujai321: do you remember which year you did your last variety stream (which was probably Stray)?
[1:10:15] Deevo_Twitch: Gotcha
[1:10:17] databob1: they should have made the patch allabout taking back boralus and skipped the digs
[1:10:20] Deevo_Twitch: Lol

[1:11:07] Kurama__95: As a kid I played a lot of GTA, never did a mission, just mindless mass murder LUL
[1:11:11] Ujai321: you have seen prople in your life or on stream playing GTA?
[1:11:15] Ryok: i haven't played a GTA game since 3 xD and all i did in all the games up until then was use cheats for all weapons, invincibility and infinite ammo and just shot whatever moved xD
[1:11:19] fractalcrescendo: I mostly raced in GTA 5, I like the way racing feels in that game.
[1:11:21] Ujai321: because that does make a difference for what the goal is
[1:11:36] Zuldak: The last gta i played was vice city. That was Playstation 2
[1:11:47] cashthb: it's a society critique, kinda like a playable southpark
[1:11:58] konvekuk: whats the reasoning with the spell buttons being offset?
[1:12:01] Zuldak: There are probably people in this chat who weren't even born the last time I played GTA
[1:12:08] jgbrit: Vice City and San Andrea's were pure bangers
[1:12:47] Ujai321: so for general play, the goal is usually to become the very best (usually at mafia/crime things). on stream, it is roleplaying whatever, i dont get it either
[1:12:53] Ryok: @Zuldak well... the last time i played GTA was 21 years ago xD so probably similar length
[1:13:16] cashthb: you could have just flewn in tho
[1:13:18] Zuldak: I remember on Max stream there was a rate my ui segment. Some people ui give total psychopath vibes

[1:14:34] Deevo_Twitch: GTA 6 for some good strippers
[1:14:43] Zuldak: So yesterday went to the shop to do work. I plugged into a work station and the person who uses it has their dual monitors set up backwards so to get to the right monitor, you have to move your mouse to the left
[1:14:58] heldtheline: I made my UI look just like the old UI. I don't like change.
[1:14:58] Jack_the_Dipper: I have seen a car UI for WoW kaatDerp
[1:15:10] lauramilano09: how did you get that mount skin?
[1:15:41] Hulkhokie: @Kurama__95 once you get to a certain point, bags are so hard to keep clean
[1:16:01] Ujai321: you would like a hello kitty UI
[1:16:09] Ujai321: you like cats, after all
[1:16:34] Zuldak: Sadly pink is not a natural fur color

[1:16:42] wolfcloudchaser80: The creator of ElvUI got into trouble for using that addon to control other players via malicious code. I can't understand why it wasn't instantly banned.
[1:16:52] Ujai321: you know what song i have stuck in my head now?
[1:17:01] Hulkhokie: @Kurama__95 same here
[1:17:16] Ujai321: Hello Kitty by Avril Lavigne
[1:17:19] Zuldak: I did see some people have white pomeranians and they asked their groomer to dye black spots on them so they look like pandas
[1:17:48] Ujai321: tbh, better a cupcake than something with cream
[1:18:04] BoogiePonderosa: hello!
[1:18:34] McScooterson: "annnnnnd i'm done"
[1:18:52] BoogiePonderosa: is this the sub goal wig? or have i been missing this one by chance?
[1:18:55] Zuldak: It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake..
[1:19:12] BoogiePonderosa: woot!

[1:24:25] BoogiePonderosa: ngl Boy looks like he lost a bet :)
[1:24:33] Ujai321: how is our 100 pound best boi today? has the pain subsided a bit?
[1:24:39] wolfcloudchaser80: I don't think she'd want to stand next to Vyranoth. Too chilly.
[1:24:47] IAmScarlett__: or should i say which one would she stand next to
[1:24:58] cashthb: would I mind if messing up in my job could kill hundreds of people?
[1:25:15] Kurama__95: Did you see the hotfix bluepost on Wowhead? Battle Mender title was bugged LUL
[1:25:18] MaddiDJ4: baby moose got hurt?

[1:26:57] Blueofthenightfall: gratz on your 1800!
[1:27:02] Shrenko: is it like the initial quests that will give me a big chunk of rep?
[1:27:28] Ujai321: another word that pisses me off btw. segue. it is segway, but it should be segu
[1:27:33] Kurama__95: @Shrenko Cata reps you just need Friendly for the tabard then you spam dungeons for rep
[1:28:08] Shrenko: @Kurama__95 yeah but with Therazane I start at hated :/
[1:28:41] Kurama__95: @Shrenko Oh, it's like Sons of Hodir, once you unlock it you get a huge chunk to Neutral
[1:28:55] Shrenko: @Kurama__95 thank you so much!
[1:28:57] janahita: Not saying it's what's happening to moose, but my parents' cat had an unexplained limp that ended up being a bacterial infection. 3 months of antibiotics brought her back to normal! I hope he gets better soon

[1:39:44] sence_00: does your DPS ever defend you in SS? Ive been screaming interally when they let me get chain CCd and die
[1:40:25] sence_00: lol fair
[1:40:32] MaddiDJ4: change was cool when I was a kid and I got to scavenge the house to go to the gas station for candy. now? I leave the little change pocket open sometimes and get a bomb of copper in my bag
[1:41:01] Zuldak: I've tried to pvp arena. I just can't. It's like kryptonite to me.
[1:41:02] sence_00: 41 is awesome, I broke 30% this morning which feels amazing
[1:41:40] sence_00: @Zuldak I think you have to find the right class for it. I was real bad on my PVE main
[1:41:54] MaddiDJ4: I don‚Äôt think I have a physical bank‚Ä¶ and the banks in town scare me. what if I do bank wrong?
[1:41:56] Zuldak: I've managed to convert my wife to put everything on credit card. No lost change and rewards are cool
[1:41:57] Ujai321: did you start breeding in palworld yet? i remember you liked horse breeding in BDO
[1:42:18] Zuldak: @sence_00 I'm a one trick bear. I can't play anything else to any sort of skill level
[1:42:23] cashthb: I didn't even use cash in ages - besides bus tickets, the local bus company has... questionable internet
[1:42:32] VarixDH: cant get over 1500 in solo shuffle.... even with my dh .. must say maybe not enough games but its sooooo stressfull to play
[1:42:58] Zuldak: I'm still mixed on qr codes. Like... eh
[1:43:12] Zuldak: Like going to a restaurant with a qr code menu
[1:43:29] MaddiDJ4: I used to collect those flattened Pennies. I had a book to keep them in from the titanic museum, those were so fun
[1:43:46] VoxDawnbringer: @Zuldak better than someone handing you a menu with the previous person's greasy hand juices on it lol
[1:44:16] Ujai321: i visited london once, and you can just NFC scan your card at the tube when you get in and out. it calculates your fare automatically, always gets the best option, and caps you for the day. it was fantastic
[1:44:45] MaddiDJ4: @voxdawnbringer when I worked at a Mexican restaurant that still kept laminated menus and my job at the host stand was to wipe them down to prevent that
[1:45:07] alex_klutch: London is so fun
[1:45:14] VoxDawnbringer: @MaddiDJ4 I'm glad you worked somewhere clean!
[1:45:19] sence_00: London isnt THAT crammed...but I thought the food was prettty weak
[1:45:37] Ujai321: but if you want to ask the king if he needs your boost... how are you gonna do that if you dont go to london
[1:45:40] AztraTheSupermage: The subway is packed during rush hour, other than that it's not so bad.
[1:45:43] MaddiDJ4: @sence_00 no beans on toast for you?
[1:45:48] cashthb: also, what is there to see in london? go to belgrade instead!
[1:46:10] Toiarc: Hi. Do you know what is the max amount of quets you can take at sametime on retail?
[1:46:10] AztraTheSupermage: Or are you talking about London, Ontario?
[1:46:13] Hulkhokie: i met you at blizzcon a few years back and did not know that fact at the time, I feel bad (I was with Deckard Cain, not that you'd remember either way)
[1:46:16] alex_klutch: So many events in London, musicals, concerts, parties
[1:46:19] Ujai321: fishing is more than 25 minutes away
[1:46:25] Hexakord: It depends - if you're visiting a touristy area during a nice weekend day during the summer, it is very crowded.
[1:46:35] IAmScarlett__: hazel why go to london when you can go to birmingham instead
[1:46:37] Ujai321: london ontario is not very densely populated
[1:46:39] IAmScarlett__: you get to see the bullring
[1:46:49] cashthb: full balkan tour, you can learn all the languages, like imagine flexing your romainian in serbia :)
[1:46:59] IAmScarlett__: its ouir shopping centre
[1:47:03] AztraTheSupermage: Why go anywhere, when you can stay at home?
[1:47:04] Ujai321: you will know it when you get there
[1:47:07] Toiarc: There used to be counter in questie or some other addon that showed quests. I cant put my head to it what name of addon was. Questie isnt updated to retail I think.
[1:47:14] MaddiDJ4: honestly I wish I had a more walkable city. granted I spend more time in the suburbs but if I want to leave work for lunch I kinda wish I could walk or rent one of those electric scooters instead of wasting the gas
[1:47:18] GreenArrowed: i really only travel to places where i want to eat and go to museums/zoos/etc
[1:47:24] Zuldak: I do know ozzy wants to have his farewell concert in Birmingham
[1:47:36] ItzKBH: I travel alot for music gigs in the UK, best place i've been to is Manchester for price and stuff
[1:47:45] ItzKBH: London is to crowded and expensive
[1:47:48] VoxDawnbringer: @Toiarc In Dec. 2022, they increased the max # of quests in the log to 35.
[1:48:09] Zuldak: I lived in Salzburg Austria for a while. It's nice but you get sick of motzart
[1:48:13] Ujai321: cant really argue with you. but it is nice to see different cities, if just to appreciate what you have with yours
[1:48:21] Zuldak: You also miss English after a whole
[1:48:24] Zuldak: While
[1:48:25] decimquiin: whats your achievement point count?
[1:48:36] Ujai321: or, whatever floats your boat. maybe you are a camping gal, and want to see the rocky mountains or whatever
[1:48:39] GreenArrowed: i really love botanic gardens so i like traveling to places with interesting ones
[1:48:44] cashthb: at 14 you can probably kill everything before they could deal damage
[1:48:49] cashthb: nvm...
[1:48:53] cashthb: prolly at 15 too
[1:49:07] Zuldak: Yeah you could go to Switzerland and see the matterhorn
[1:49:27] Ujai321: well, they kind of speak english in australia Kappa
[1:49:34] ItzKBH: I might be travelling to Savannah with work, but been told everything is like an hour drive from the factory i'll be working at :(
[1:49:41] MaddiDJ4: I used to take the train up to Chicago to go visit my grandparents in Michigan. one time we got stuck overnight due to an app error making us miss our train. hated Chicago ever since, doesn‚Äôt help any time a family member goes there they get sixk
[1:49:44] Zuldak: Yeah Austrians get confused with Australia a lot... one is down under with kangaroos and the other is in the Alps.
[1:50:07] Ujai321: you watched what yesterday?
[1:50:16] MaddiDJ4: I honestly used to think Austria was a nickname for Australia until I met an Austrian
[1:50:24] cashthb: you could camp in transylvania too! I'm getting more and more convinced that you should go to the balkans
[1:50:27] IAmScarlett__: i might just sit here and do a bunch of +2s to get comfortable in keys
[1:50:39] Zuldak: Yeah they get that a lot too... Arnold is kinda the face of their nation.
[1:50:52] Jack_the_Dipper: He had a hars dad
[1:51:13] Ujai321: you know what, if i had 1 million guesses what you watched yesterday, i would not have gotten that
[1:51:20] cashthb: @Zuldak yeeah... surely it's Arnold
[1:51:24] Zuldak: Over a thousand years of history of the hapsberg empire and they are now the land of Arnold and not Australia
[1:51:33] Kretyn: No, you can't unfortunately
[1:51:35] goplacidly56: I thought only 70, huh
[1:51:40] Kretyn: I wish though :(
[1:51:41] MaddiDJ4: Y‚Äôall keep me company at work. fighting with the scanner feels better when listening to the weird noises in pvp
[1:51:57] Gurottesquex: I hope they let you eventually. It would be good for leveling I think.
[1:52:11] goplacidly56: i did these quests here last night for the trading post log
[1:52:22] goplacidly56: quick way to do 15 quests lol
[1:52:31] Ujai321: hang on, why do you have a monk
[1:53:05] cashthb: it's a lot of mana tho
[1:53:09] Blloood: is it a medical reason you had to shave your hair?
[1:53:16] mockspiral: gusts is passive proc
[1:53:24] Ujai321: !hair
[1:53:24] Streamlabs: Hazel cut her hair in pursuit of a more practical, comfortable style.
[1:53:24] Zuldak: Mawwalker Molly wobbles, the mist weaver monk
[1:53:27] IAmScarlett__: she was like
[1:53:29] IAmScarlett__: no hair
[1:53:32] IAmScarlett__: no hair good!
[1:53:41] Ujai321: much less funny bot command tbh
[1:53:53] goplacidly56: no hair = more time
[1:53:56] Blloood: but you wear wigs?
[1:54:02] l_Denix_l: what would you say are the best classes to run old content to farm mounts
[1:54:06] Ujai321: !wig
[1:54:07] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:54:11] Blloood: I dont use wigs, but i imagine my own hair being more comfortable than fake hair
[1:54:12] goplacidly56: obviously she does
[1:54:22] Ujai321: see, THAT is funny
[1:54:28] HarlequinCharm: LOL love that
[1:54:33] IAmScarlett__: also hazel
[1:54:36] IAmScarlett__: i have another roll today
[1:54:40] roxywilde: hunter
[1:54:47] jeffdmk: druid is the only answer sadly
[1:54:53] antohbe: druid and arcane mage with chrono shift
[1:54:57] mythicweetbix: love the hair!!! <3
[1:55:00] Ujai321: oh no, the class colors!
[1:55:01] heldtheline: hunter is good because of choice of weapon mogs
[1:55:08] azrazil720: I like my rogue for stealthing past everything besides what I want to kill
[1:55:11] Ujai321: thank you, appreciated
[1:55:12] Blloood: Warrior is good becuse they are the class that can equip the most different kind of equipment
[1:55:14] Blloood: esp wepons
[1:56:06] MaddiDJ4: just got the war within. I‚Äôm excited to play with the griffin, I‚Äôm a bit tired of dragons
[1:56:08] Blloood: One wish i had was that old content would scale a bit better
[1:56:09] IAmScarlett__: what made you make a character called mollywobble
[1:56:14] Blloood: feels like its either way to easy or way to hard
[1:56:42] roxywilde: there are dragon riding races just for the gryphon
[1:56:51] Ujai321: might i suggest marking the tank, just because they seem VERY quick
[1:57:14] painndespair: vivify is free each 10s
[1:57:21] VoxDawnbringer: i like purple the best on the griffin. not a fan of the orange myself
[1:57:42] scootmage: howdy, hazel!
[1:58:41] Mejafo: hey Hazel how are you and the cat
[1:59:23] Mejafo: how's thing on the west coast
[1:59:32] Ujai321: it was a good idea. not so much now
[2:00:15] Hulkhokie: i am so awful at those gryphon races
[2:00:26] Mejafo: thats good it's -4c here
[2:00:31] Hulkhokie: i still havent' figured out how to tell if i'm getting static charge (other than flying by a wall)
[2:00:43] MaddiDJ4: forgot you were Canadian for a second. thought that 10¬∞ Weather that far north is normal, maybe it is for Fahrenheit
[2:00:47] supashanka: daww look at that well mannered kitty
[2:00:50] Ujai321: also, having to pick 2 talents every time you do a dungeon? who has time to read that much!
[2:01:16] jeffdmk: just do quests on max level characters to collect all the missing item ids you need
[2:01:20] Ujai321: what tropics are you living in
[2:01:22] sence_00: fistweaving happens later
[2:01:28] witchhobbit: hi hazel! hi kira! hazelVoid
[2:01:28] sence_00: the left side of the MW tree
[2:01:29] VoxDawnbringer: @Hulkhokie MikScrollingBattleText mod shows when you get static charge
[2:01:30] painndespair: ancient teaching its at level 50
[2:01:39] cashthb: somewhere around the bottom, that's really miniscular healing tho
[2:01:58] sence_00: Ancient Teachings is what does it mostly
[2:02:01] ntdrongo: right
[2:02:08] goplacidly56: Kira is snubbing us lol
[2:02:12] Hulkhokie: @VoxDawnbringer thanks!  I used to use that addon, maybe I should pick it back up
[2:02:31] Ujai321: i'm only half joking with the reading btw. when i see talents that have like 10 lines of text, my eyes just roll back into my head
[2:02:33] cashthb: you just go rising sun kick -> black out kick -> healing spell -> black out kick -> healing spell.....
[2:02:34] VoxDawnbringer: @Hulkhokie yeah it shows ground skimming too. it's super nice!
[2:04:27] Ujai321: so mechagnomes dont have opposable thumbs? that's harsh
[2:04:31] cashthb: there are some dumb stuff tho, like frost mage has a talent that increases damage on targets that are frozen **and snared**
[2:04:41] pancakemaster808: my hardcore brain is telling you to run
[2:04:42] Ujai321: nothing is dangerous in retail
[2:05:12] cashthb: @Ujai321 what about elevators?
[2:05:55] Ujai321: you just hate buttons on cloths for your gnome, thats fine
[2:06:14] roxywilde: jumping off a cliff with the wrong mount...
[2:06:51] Ujai321: is this the one that rattles?
[2:06:52] McScooterson: the maw rats do have a certain appeal
[2:07:12] cashthb: you could just shave  a worg and it would look the same
[2:07:17] Ujai321: oh right, i was thinking about the shadehounds
[2:07:27] itsparvati: im so behind on wow news. just watched xpac trailer.. is alleria going bad??? please NO
[2:07:48] cashthb: never heard it over laptop fans
[2:07:55] Ujai321: dang man, rare founder's badge
[2:08:03] McScooterson: @itsparvati alleria and knife wife have a super similar model
[2:08:23] itsparvati: @itsparvati oh is that they lady we let out??
[2:08:25] Ujai321: pavarti has a twitch founder's badge for your channel
[2:08:30] Ujai321: is what i was saying
[2:08:54] McScooterson: @itsparvati yep yep
[2:08:59] wolfcloudchaser80: I think they're using Alleria as the example of Shadow/Void being a force for good.
[2:09:18] itsparvati: @itsparvati ok good. i really didnt want alleria to be the big bad
[2:09:27] sence_00: @itsparvati she and Turalyon also do some pretty questionable things in the bfa book so...
[2:10:04] itsparvati: @itsparvati well thats war crimes, we all do that. going to the void though is different
[2:10:31] sence_00: @itsparvati lol and yikes
[2:10:42] Ujai321: can always come back in an hour (or slightly less than an hour)
[2:10:47] McScooterson: oh man if "that's war crimes, we all do that" isn't the most WoW sentence ever
[2:10:59] itsparvati: it is
[2:11:16] itsparvati: if you been playing since MC, you aint innocent
[2:11:24] dvkJoe: dvkJoe is gifting 10 Tier 1 Subs to HazelNuttyGames's community! They've gifted a total of 90 in the channel!

[2:11:29] Ujai321: you could demonstrate ... what's the website that gives you a "what to farm next" route
[2:11:55] psyphen443: soup is in 18 minutes. get that flavor pocket?
[2:12:04] itsparvati: data for azeroth is best collector site
[2:12:07] VoxDawnbringer: I still haven't gotten the mechagon wheel mount and that's highly disappointing to me haha
[2:12:18] Ujai321: wdym, "invested in the class campaign". are you doing lore now?
[2:12:54] Ujai321: so the kitchen just stays a mess?
[2:12:59] SaraDivine: the otter rare you can spawn in forbidden reach also drops flavor pockets i found out. the item to spawn him is pretty cheap too. for people trying to farm it.
[2:13:00] Ujai321: i cant live like that man
[2:13:02] itsparvati: but my adhd says to do it all at once
[2:13:11] supashanka: that cabinet closure lol
[2:13:15] roxywilde: shuffle
[2:13:40] Ujai321: that is fair
[2:13:57] cashthb: you could also start your bioshock walktrough
[2:14:42] Ujai321: they... dont go with the white dress, sadly
[2:14:55] cashthb: I can tell you some news if you want some
[2:14:56] tehl00py: i forgot it's february! time to spend tendies
[2:15:27] Ujai321: how much tendies do you have left now?
[2:15:30] Triskelian: Not the rocket mount
[2:15:33] Ujai321: (if any)
[2:16:09] cashthb: btw how about an epic bg?
[2:16:21] Ujai321: did you remember you had your raid frames hidden in raid btw?
[2:16:29] Zuldak: im still waiting on the duck mount
[2:16:32] Zuldak: give duck, blizzard
[2:17:19] SaraDivine: i think it's the same items in the 5 seed quest each week too
[2:18:06] McScooterson: please to gib duck and bakar mounts blizz
[2:18:32] TheSonicDwarf: Everquest has a duck mount hehe
[2:18:43] sence_00: honor lvl 100!!!!
[2:18:43] forebringer: they'll give us a duck mount for Dragonflight timewalking
[2:18:44] supashanka: apparently i'm way to picky with my trader tender, i'm sitting on 8k <.<
[2:18:53] Zuldak: or... hear me out... druid duck forms... but its guardian druid so a duck tank
[2:19:09] supashanka: yeah thats how i feel about it as well
[2:19:09] McScooterson: @Zuldak yessss
[2:19:16] tylerg2018: Which achievement were you looking for?
[2:19:40] tylerg2018: Oh, Battle Mender, its a feat of strength so it will be hidden
[2:19:41] sence_00: I duno if its tracked
[2:19:55] sence_00: or its at the very bottom
[2:20:06] sence_00: of the Arena section
[2:20:18] tylerg2018: Its a feat of strength so its hidden until you get it
[2:20:29] Ryok: i used to have an addon called overachiever that would show feat of strengths and such but it was sadly not kept up to date girldmSad
[2:21:54] dvkJoe: You look like a Blood Elf with that hairstyle. Love it.
[2:23:00] tylerg2018: Are links allowed here? Can post the wowhead link to the battle mender and you could try using the ingame link, might show your progress that way?
[2:23:27] Ryok: no links are eaten
[2:24:49] Ryok: i wish they wouldn't need 90 of the lower ones D: that's so expensive
[2:25:17] psyphen443: seed heals more if upgraded
[2:25:26] ahnn112: i got the sapling trinket i hate it so much give me passives
[2:25:31] puntualus: The emerald dream soundtrack is lovely
[2:26:43] Zurestel77: whats the addon showing your seeds to the side?
[2:26:54] HazelNuttyGames: !addons
[2:26:55] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[2:27:02] Zurestel77: thank you <3
[2:28:11] databob1: how do you trade crests up?
[2:28:31] Jack_the_Dipper: btw ty for recommending the teleportation addon. Very handy! kaatHappy
[2:28:32] jamien_10: you can get extra pets to sell with the infusions
[2:28:33] psyphen443: can sell battle pets from infusions on ah
[2:29:13] witchhobbit: would there really be a lot of people buying the pets on ah tho?
[2:29:15] databob1: it only lets me trade down
[2:29:40] McScooterson: @databob1 iirc you have to earn enough to be able to trade up
[2:29:41] Ryok: @databob1 you also need the "dreaming of drakes/wyrms/aspects" achievements which requires you to outgrow the use of a certain crest type
[2:30:03] jamien_10: @haleych not really...I haven't been able to get any to sell
[2:30:20] Ryok: you need to have certain ilvls in EVERY slot to unlock them, for aspect ones it's 476 in every slot
[2:30:21] databob1: oh ok
[2:30:25] databob1: nuts
[2:30:27] jamien_10: but maybe after the expansion is over
[2:30:27] cashthb: Hazel, would you eat a human if it was made out of vegetables?
[2:30:41] Rugmanimus: Big Dig is up!
[2:30:55] Ryok: it's 450 for drakes, 463 for wyrm and 476 for aspect
[2:31:16] Ryok: important... not average ilvl but ilvl for every slot
[2:31:38] Kretyn: If you feed apple juice to an apple tree, is it forced cannibalism?
[2:31:47] Rugmanimus: got 8 more mins on it
[2:32:09] Ryok: ngl i'm thinking about farming 11s to uptrade aspect crests just so i have a way easier time instead of pugging 16s xD because some of them are really bad
[2:32:23] cashthb: you sure? it's like the gingerbread man from shrek but from veggies, it has no organs so it couldn't die and it would scream as you devouer it
[2:32:41] Vesamora: dragon is a mood, I am also out of vigor
[2:32:48] Ryok: yeah but i could just combine it with courser farm ^^
[2:33:50] sence_00: do you think you had a distinct "ya i can do this" moment with stuff like M+ and PVP? Or is it really just gradual familiarity?
[2:34:05] sence_00: M+ feels OK now but PVP is still scary every Q
[2:34:26] Ryok: some friends keep wanting to drag me into 18s... i don't want to farm vault slots i'm 483 i'm fine with my gear ^^' i just want to give every key a try or two for a portal but i don't even want to grind for those xD
[2:35:20] cashthb: @sence_00 I'd just do random bgs untill I get confident enough in my ability, sure arena is very different but still
[2:35:21] Toiarc: I thought pvp solo suffle is fair 1v1 fight and was dissapointed.
[2:36:06] myself337: myself337 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:36:06] Streamlabs: myself337 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:36:29] sence_00: good point about the rating climb, 20keys are still scary imo
[2:36:47] bigfluffy82: There are times I miss the way wow used to be, I dunno it felt more of a grind back then
[2:36:59] Ryok: but are they even friends? we played all of SL then we started grinding for 20s in S1 of DF and then they just VANISHED for like... half end of S1 until like 4 weeks into S3 D: leaving me to pug everything
[2:37:33] Ryok: one of them would show up every 4-12 weeks would tell me "yeah i'm gonna play now again" and vanish for another few months D:
[2:38:13] Nnamu: wow and here i was thinking we were friends BibleThump
[2:38:38] Ryok: like yeah i get RL can be busy and all that... but it takes like 3 minutes to log into bnet sent me a message even if i'm offline to let me know girldmSad just so i'm not worried they abandoned the game or died
[2:38:47] psyphen443: pushing as a solo dps is big suck without a group of friends. have such an easy time pushing as tank or healer since it‚Äôs easier to get into groups
[2:39:04] psyphen443: easier
[2:39:21] bigfluffy82: How long have you been playing hazel?
[2:39:43] Mejafo: too true
[2:40:05] psyphen443: I am h priest main, pugs make me sad sometimes
[2:40:06] Ryok: @psyphen443 i pushed my way from 0 as havoc up to like 2250 in like a month and a half and my friends starts playing again like 4 or 5 weeks ago and because he's a tank he zoomed past me and is now like 2700 D:
[2:40:28] sibimi: what is your least favourite healer to play? hazelLove
[2:40:50] illidari_Neeko: @hazelnuttygames Hope your having a wonderful day üíï hazelLove hazelLove hazelLove
[2:41:10] VoxDawnbringer: aren't mistweavers also tied to melee a bit?
[2:41:21] psyphen443: I had a disc priest jump off the side when I was tanking a 22 because pally was doing 75k st on tyr
[2:41:35] Ryok: we're technically always still pugging because it's usually just me a dps, a tank and a healer friend but man... even playing with a tank who you know makes SUCH a big difference D:
[2:41:49] sence_00: MW is nearly all melee, except in PVP and sometimes raid
[2:42:04] sence_00: I think HPal is less melee right now?
[2:42:31] sence_00: I just know a bunch of the pro HPals hate it right now
[2:42:39] watchCrimson: Good day everyone ^^
[2:42:41] Minobard: Glad to report, A Turtle made it to the water.
[2:42:42] Ryok: @sence_00 hpal is still best in melee just like MW but you're not completely useless when you can't get into melee for a few seconds
[2:43:24] sence_00: @Ryok ah gotcha, Ive done suuuper low keys as HPal but thats about it
[2:44:10] sence_00: do you lose Vers when you catalyze to Tier? Or do the stats stay
[2:44:11] Nnamu: lumbersack lol
[2:44:19] Ryok: @sence_00 from what i gathered in yumytv's stream you still want to be in melee though because just hard casting will run you out of mana even faster than normal (hpal is very mana inefficient last i heard)
[2:45:27] Ryok: i would love that vicious mount but man... the spider in S1 SL was such a pain and i already have a moonbeast D:
[2:48:37] Nnamu: Interesting sound effects
[2:49:44] Nnamu: my roll the bones wa plays the mario kart star power up track when i get all the buffs lol
[2:51:56] Kaseyfullofjoy: @Nnamu can i has that whats it called lol
[2:52:29] AstroGeorge_: Night Elf Mohawk here.
[2:52:38] Nnamu: download the song as an .ogg file and then create a weakaura that tracks when you get the buffs
[2:53:14] IAmScarlett__: i can just feel that im never gonna get tier
[2:54:03] Kaseyfullofjoy: @Nnamu oh shid <3
[2:54:43] Nnamu: theres a bunch of good roll the bones weakauras on wagoio, just download them and change the sound file path under the custom options tab in wa
[2:55:17] murloc_kingkiller: i love that people can enjoy this game in many ways--i would be 100% lost in pvp, and these fights take a long time lol
[2:55:22] BoogiePonderosa: who's voice is it for the BAM?
[2:55:37] BoogiePonderosa: oh ok :D
[2:55:41] Ryok: you should even have 8 catalyst charges üëÄ
[2:55:49] cashthb: it's mine :)
[2:55:50] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[2:55:54] BoogiePonderosa: that would be a good one
[2:55:56] McScooterson: Now there's someone I haven't thought of in years
[2:56:01] BoogiePonderosa: "motivational BAM"
[2:56:06] Zuldak: it sounds like ewan mcgregor
[2:56:42] Zuldak: like im pretty sure its cut from star wars
[2:56:45] BoogiePonderosa: yeah it does sound like mcgregor as well
[2:57:33] databob1: doesn't sound like Emeril
[2:58:31] cashthb: I have friendly name plates too... kinda condusing somethimes
[2:58:39] cashthb: helps a lot on other
[2:58:47] random_redshirt: hazelShiny hazelShiny hazelShiny
[2:59:47] Perkolate: it's all personal taste as well
[3:01:51] cashthb: have you tried having more mana?
[3:02:38] goplacidly56: nice
[3:02:59] goplacidly56: Have a great day Hazel, Kira and Moose
[3:03:05] goplacidly56: Hope he feels better
