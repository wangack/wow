[1:36:08] Voidthos: My Pal is developing an eating disorder due to stress, what the absolute fuck
[1:36:29] Poxumo: when playing a game with limited resources, when inviting others, they will take up all the resources, and you lose the enjoyment of the core game.
[1:36:35] trinilime: the way they roll down the hill is brutal lol
[1:36:37] WeedFranck: agro them first arrow and use the baseball bat
[1:36:40] WeedFranck: :P

[1:37:10] neverbornlucky: lux yourballs are good enough
[1:37:30] Voidthos: @Baladore How do you not, they do their own thing?
[1:37:42] WeedFranck: should built a bed for passing night :)
[1:37:45] Angryfist40: you need another bed
[1:37:48] Angryfist40: lol
[1:37:48] Baladore: @Voidthos That's why you find multiples of the same type, so you swap them out

[1:38:05] DarkBeasty_: so when you capture human npcs they'll sleep in pokemon bed LUL
[1:38:19] ShroudedFoxx: They all need a bed

[1:59:15] RUSTbomb: I have never had any interest in pokemon type stuff, but this game is fun
[1:59:18] Yoshiho: hey Lux, do you see this game as a long-term-fun or it's just early hype and it will quickly bore man? Any assumptions so far?
[1:59:18] lit_alien69: me
[1:59:23] joustiif: yepper
[1:59:27] WeedFranck: at least 10, if they have sold 4 millions copies.

[2:00:26] WeedFranck: player
[2:00:32] WeedFranck: god jesus
[2:01:21] RUSTbomb: for $25 its casual fun. and its only going to grow
[2:02:06] RUSTbomb: I don't think this game is going to bump any other but its a good in between
[2:02:07] SpectraBG: depends how it's made, valheim doesn't do resets, conan does
[2:02:14] Baladore: It's EA as well, so can only get better (usually)
[2:02:15] neverbornlucky: servers will most likely reset but personal pc don't see a need
[2:02:20] Angryfist40: this one streamer got pissed off at the game because he kept dying ever so often then he realized he was dying because he wasnt eating LUL
[2:03:22] Angryfist40: yeah pokemon do but not your main char lol
[2:03:29] Angryfist40: or Pals*
[2:04:11] Baladore: @Angryfist40 Until you get the food bag, then you auto eat as well
[2:04:15] WeedFranck: KEKW what we can read on internet right now : Predictions are made that Palworld will likely secure the title of Game of the Year for 2024, even though we're still in January.
[2:04:49] Sarocus: little early to call out goty, isnt it?
[2:04:51] Baladore: Mmm, it's still early tbh.
[2:04:52] ShroudedFoxx: Not a chance
[2:04:57] Baladore: It's a good game but yeah
[2:05:00] gargakan: Enshrouded as more chance
[2:05:02] Sarocus: also, it wont be palworld
[2:05:10] trinilime: it's also january
[2:05:12] neverbornlucky: Lux they snubbed so many good games for bad games so its a trend on game of the year
[2:05:23] Vahs_Redclaw: who tf said this is getting goty xD
[2:05:30] WeedFranck: the games who sold 86 000 copies per hour KEKW
[2:05:31] Vahs_Redclaw: hell naw
[2:05:38] Khadgarlic: hmmm I'm tempting to press on add to cart
[2:05:57] WeedFranck: This is more than New World KEKW
[2:06:00] StreamElements:  Enjoying the stream? Considering subscribing to support: https://www.twitch.tv/subs/luxthos
[2:06:15] Sarocus: The twitch bandwagons are always insane.
[2:06:19] Vahs_Redclaw: this is pokemon in a new engine thats why it sold so many copies
[2:06:25] Sarocus: Streamers are human centipedes confirmed
[2:06:33] Meewile: @Luxthos There's that aspect that a lot of people wanted Open World Pokemon game for the longest time and lets be honest, Nintendo will never do it, so this is the best we can get
[2:06:34] Sarocus: present company excluded, of course
[2:07:48] WeedFranck: @Meewile for me it's really an unexpected GOOD games :P
[2:08:25] WeedFranck: imagine throw humans balls instead KEKW
[2:08:29] chronoit: but then it wouldn't get compared to pokemon and generate that buzz
[2:08:33] TheGiant99: i think similarity to pokemon is the draw for most
[2:08:33] Angryfist40: yeah just have Humeon
[2:09:00] ZeroRekuiemu: I mean, you CAN capture humans in this and have them work at your base
[2:09:31] Baladore: This game is 15+ games in one, and done well. Ends up as a unique game.
[2:09:45] ZeroRekuiemu: SeemsGood
[2:09:48] WeedFranck: and anyway humans are useless into base, only their for making money for when you go to the village to exchange gold
[2:09:57] chronoit: their AI bro CEO couldn't help himself though
[2:10:05] ZeroRekuiemu: Now I'm imaging a Robopoke game
[2:10:09] neverbornlucky: lux can we get the pokemon song going ?
[2:10:11] ZeroRekuiemu: That'd be sick
[2:10:36] Jol_jin: @ZeroRekuiemu Digimon?
[2:10:57] ZeroRekuiemu: @jol_jin Zoids.
[2:11:05] ZeroRekuiemu: Zoids!
[2:11:10] WeedFranck: Factorio , already made KEKW
[2:11:14] TheGiant99: it wont sell as good as this.....this is popular because of the pokemon vibe
[2:11:38] trinilime: the pokemon vibe is both the best and worst part about this game
[2:11:42] neverbornlucky: Lux you should ai gen that game idea and then sell it
[2:12:00] StreamElements:  Thanks to Starforge for powering and sponsoring the stream! Max out your FPS with a new Starforge PC at https://starforgepc.com/Luxthos
[2:12:04] WeedFranck: but it's like Nintendo, but this is not. KEKW
[2:12:09] Ralimas: Everyone has wanted a open world game like this with pokemon
[2:12:14] Onyxvoid1203: Onyxvoid1203 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months!

[2:12:36] WeedFranck: the game is popular because Nintendo doesn't wanted to do it.
[2:12:40] Effin_Steffin: @ralimas They were close with Legends of Arceus
[2:13:05] WeedFranck: @Effin_Steffin Palworld is Arceus x100
[2:13:06] TheGiant99: its what makes the game sell 4million in 48 hours
[2:13:16] Ralimas: @Effin_Steffin I didnt like that particular game concept. was too focused around pokemon rather than a "survival" aspect
[2:13:52] mentosz09: Evening fuckers
[2:14:16] Strke1: I want to try it but i am going to pass. Looks cool but i am playing prince of persia and diablo4 season when it comes out
[2:14:29] WeedFranck: Palworld > arceus x100
[2:14:30] Meewile: I know where you are going from, but this one time I want to be selfish bitch and let them ripoff Nintendo cause Nintendo will never make proper openworld Pokemon game and will instead keep milking what they are doing
[2:14:42] Strke1: I have sooooo many switch games to play through still. Octopath and sea of stars
[2:14:45] ZeroRekuiemu: Let's be honest , All sales nowadays are 100% carried by Influencers like you said with among us and soda
[2:15:00] trinilime: problem is this game will always be *like* pokemon. it will never *be* pokemon. that will always be a problem for the game
[2:15:19] WeedFranck: @trinilime but nintendo will never do a game like this too.
[2:16:05] chronoit: They are going to destroy my hobby of game playing
[2:16:43] neverbornlucky: lux just needs a hug chat
[2:16:43] Darkside1366: i think people play whats fun to them and they dont care if they rip off something
[2:16:49] Arashikaiju: It's easy to be angry with Nintendo...
[2:16:51] happybooger: i would
[2:17:00] StreamElements:  Did you miss one of the playthroughs or would like to watch it again? The new channel Luxthos Plays is now live -> https://www.youtube.com/@luxthosplays
[2:17:09] mentosz09: Eventually everything will be a ripoff of something else to be fair
[2:17:17] ZeroRekuiemu: Question Lux about the game, I noticed a few people have the base at same place as you, can you pick where you put your base or is it just you can customize it?
[2:17:26] WeedFranck: imagine how much money if the do the BEST pokemon game KEKW
[2:17:32] TheGiant99: alot of people are influenced by what to play and buy by streamers and youtubers.....if this wasnt hyped on youtube and twitch it wouldnt be selling
[2:17:38] Meewile: Holy fuck, I would pay 200€ for Pokemon open world game from Nintendo, I wouldn't care
[2:18:21] Meewile: @Luxthos look at Coromon
[2:19:00] Ealdfox: That's the difference between inspiration vs rip off
[2:19:36] mentosz09: I understand nothing!
[2:19:42] Stormrazer78: you wil play wow today?
[2:20:05] TheGiant99: they where smart....the paid some streamers to play it early access and that created tons of hype and people flocked to buy it
[2:20:26] Narosa25: luxthoLurk Hiya Lux and chat! How's everyone doing?
[2:20:46] WeedFranck: @TheGiant99 and steam version is 0.1.2 and game pass is 0.1.0 KEKW

[2:24:50] Ruski96: Did you moved places? Nice background @Luxthos
[2:24:51] Strouss: I cant belive im here grinding porfession in wrath classic... never thought i would do it, but the M+/Gamma stuff was fun so why not lol.
[2:24:57] saevenar: I main DK (frost and unholy, occasionally blood) and am a long-time melee player, but I have taken to playing mistweaver this patch as a switch in gameplay and it's been a lot of fun
[2:25:03] WeedFranck: yep
[2:25:19] neverbornlucky: Lux you were going to say you want a bath in the game
[2:25:21] TheGiant99: as someone playing LE for over a year it doesnt feel like a launch to me

[2:29:04] Peanutbeards: I never understand Blizz's class tuning. Like prot warrior for example. They didnt need more hp or ignore pain. They need more dps compared to every other tank doing so much more.
[2:29:45] saevenar: I want them to add a raid buff/debuff to DK so that they provide a "whispers of the grave" or whatever that increases damage in execute range
[2:29:54] Voidthos: Warlock is going to be DoT heavy
[2:30:02] TheGiant99: Yea warlock and falconeer are the new LE classes
