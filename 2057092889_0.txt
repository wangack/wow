[3:48:38] killanyoux: u get a vacine?
[3:48:44] bangbangdeveloper: People experiencing physical fatigue. It's the long term effect of the virus. What people could tolerate before is too much now.

[3:52:24] akasuda: Thats called echochambers right?
[3:52:30] Rapapep: genetics play a part in diet aswell.
[3:52:36] thisisnotanick: and the google algoritms tend to show you content that it thinks you would like, so you end up in an information bubble

[3:53:29] LovieXia: best advise for burning belly fat?
[3:53:30] Indomitablez: I havent logged in yet since it went live Ill check
[3:53:31] Darkaon: Eggs used to be so bad for you. Then good for you. Then bad for you. Now they are good for you again. I know from experiance and from every single person in my life that the vaccine had zero side affects. But thats the internet for you. People will live in echo chambers and only look up the info that goes with how they think
[3:53:32] MrSlyth: Ever since covid and getting sick I feel more prone to sickness especially something respiratory. Had Covid/Flu/Rsv in a total of 6 weeks and Hospitalized for 2 weeks straight. Also dont have the same enerhy as I once did precovid. Something is off.

[3:54:26] yarrpeter: SDS*
[3:54:27] bangbangdeveloper: The vaccine had immense effectiveness on mortality rates. Just look to italy.
[3:54:28] fellifell: the vaccine made my pp bigger soniiDance
[3:54:31] NIVE0US: I have family members who personally have developed autoimmune disorders from it.
[3:54:44] harleyjaymes: why rfk?
[3:54:45] PibbyTV: @fellifell POGGERS
[3:54:52] Darkaon: Like i said. Im talking in my experience of everyone I know myself. Of course people are gonna have diffferent experiences.
[3:54:53] churrosity: these dudes really tryna catch u up
[3:54:54] Cubanito06: this tauren looks wierd
[3:54:54] bangbangdeveloper: In Italy people were lying dead in their beds for weeks because there was no capacity to pick them up or anywhere to store them, sadly.
[3:54:59] KhamulESO: its not controversy thats the issue , its the dug in position ppl have about it that makes it obnoxious to discuss so i agree lets drop it XD
[3:55:00] SamMorito: Are u an all anti vax or just a covid non vax
[3:55:01] ShaneiumTheCranium: The army was telling female soldiers who were pregnant if they didnt get it they were being kicked out.
