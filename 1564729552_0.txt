[0:34:04] Overlagged: what is your rbg rating?
[0:34:09] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Smooth by Afilion -> https://prtzl.io/V1HAN9QQNpNPnnf5
[0:34:17] mirsies: yeah...starting 1/1/2023 i think it has to be assembled in the US...and there's something about the batteries needing to be locally sourced too -- on the EV tax credit
[0:34:22] kragnos0: yeah being on the whim of different countries energy outputs isnt good for overall gains
[0:34:27] oneheadlight408: Didn't Ford raise the E-vechicles by 7k?
[0:34:30] Dibles714: What powers that electricity I wonder lol
[0:34:44] mirsies: the credit starts now
[0:34:57] dashraa: i love this bg
[0:34:59] delennotv: Producing too much oil meaning overload of gas. No oil meaning price of gas goes up.
[0:34:59] mirsies: but...the inflation reduction part requires local assembling and battery
[0:35:02] Dibles714: Most everywhere is coal and oil
[0:35:05] oneheadlight408: Nuclear Fusion pretty soon =D
[0:35:07] Grouwdi: NUCLEAR !!!!!!!!!! <3
[0:35:09] insectplato: are EVs good for long drives?
[0:35:25] mirsies: lot of foreign EV companies are not happy -- VW, etc.
[0:35:28] Fullthrotle: The power grid required to charge all vehicles being electric is not sustainable. Also we don't have a proper way to recycle the batteries when they go bad. Also the electrical fires that happen from batteries are extremely hard to put out. Electric isnt the answer, neither is petro.
[0:35:31] Grouwdi: I want a Nuclear wrist watch aurang1Ohno
[0:35:35] kragnos0: I think gas probably got cheaper since alot of people I know stopped making plans for trips so less gas usage overall, some people at my old job started car pooling
[0:35:45] attre: My boss did just order a 750 kW peak solar power system
[0:35:49] TheRealCunix: @insectplato Just have a big fat diesel generator in the back of the car :P
[0:36:02] delennotv: With Saudi’s oil company producing too much oil means gas should go down but OPEC doesn’t allow them to sell it on the market cause they undercut too much
[0:36:03] Dibles714: haha
[0:36:09] Klarynse: sup swifty
