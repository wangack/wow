[4:38:39] Kreynz: what does warrior beat in 1v1?
[4:38:50] koalabearjesty: warriors crying at the window watching everyone have a good time
[4:38:52] Speyto: Yeah Sonii is complaining every stream about how they did warriors dirty
[4:38:58] Klowny25: 1v1?
[4:38:58] prodigy_wow: Warrior
[4:39:02] Klowny25: warrior LOL
[4:39:04] Kreynz: warriors are good in pve though
[4:39:11] scadattle: they legit did do warriors dirty
[4:39:24] Klowny25: I mean... we can beat classes if we crit
[4:39:31] Klowny25: if i crit 3-4x in a row I win
[4:39:52] Speyto: I appreciate that it's the full version of the song too catJAM
[4:40:02] prodigy_wow: Warrior are REALLY good vs warriors LUL what a good meme
[4:40:13] Kreynz: who was the harder mage between xar and ziqo
[4:40:14] scadattle: they need to give warriors spell reflect at the very least
[4:40:15] letho_og: warrior was never a 1v1 class
[4:40:21] MarmeN28: what addon is it that shows cc in the target frame?
[4:41:47] Kreynz: bigdebuffs
[4:42:04] DlLDUCK: fire has reduced pushback talent works with chrono
[4:42:27] glaciationz: its worth to heal the homonculus?
[4:42:31] koalabearjesty: its /tarnearest
[4:42:50] koalabearjesty: no i made that up
[4:43:01] DlLDUCK: xdd
[4:43:03] glaciationz: seems like a PoM angle on the little guys
[4:43:08] fafoo204: KEKW
[4:43:11] PerplexOW: you could play with action targeting turned on and use a Soft Target frame weakaura and @softtarget macros to shield them also
[4:43:15] PerplexOW: but it would be a big adjustment
[4:43:20] flatjokebro: helmet is red btw xD
[4:43:21] Saveth_: @glaciationz same rune slot, cant
[4:43:25] Speyto: Did they buff the homonculi hp? Or maybe they scaled well, cause I used to send 1 AE on em at 25 and they died instantly
[4:43:44] PerplexOW: I play with that setup on my mage cause it lets you basically do focus counterspells and focus sheeps in bgs
[4:43:51] PerplexOW: by abusing soft target. but its a big adjustment to learn
[4:44:08] Kreynz: wait can you pom homies or does it not work? I know u can't pom fiend
[4:44:31] Kreynz: oh right lol
[4:44:31] glaciationz: ahhh
[4:44:44] DlLDUCK: thank god u cant pom homies LUL
[4:44:59] Kreynz: i know in phase 1 it was like 2-3 AE's to kill them
[4:44:59] Narlax: what addon shows the duration of your dots on the left?
[4:45:01] Kreynz: is it still like that?
[4:45:05] prodigy_wow: I have some strong cheese for a spriest mirror
[4:45:15] prodigy_wow: Saving it for tonight
[4:45:22] Tzeipx: sod without layering and bots would actually be an ok game
[4:45:43] fafoo204: jus need a duel spot with no layers
[4:45:48] fafoo204: cross realm on off peak hours
[4:45:56] Kreynz: there should just be a drop down menu u can use to change layer manually, if it's not full
[4:46:17] fafoo204: yep that would be fuckin lit in sod
[4:46:26] fafoo204: so many ppl would get into pvp from duel area
[4:46:51] Xadriell: which addon displays the names with class colors?
[4:46:54] fafoo204: dueling is by far the best way for someone to learn to PvP imo
[4:46:56] koalabearjesty: if you put ranks on it maybe people would finally realise how bad they were
[4:47:04] dogsenses: seems like alot of the things ppl ask for already exist on some private servers for years
[4:47:18] Tzeipx: why even have layers? who played on mega pserver back then knows it also works without
[4:47:35] Speyto: Did u get any loot from the Gnomer?
