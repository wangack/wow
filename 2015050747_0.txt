[2:12:20] gelimarr: I was paying attention
[2:12:21] ackdogg007: you should do a leveling speed run from 1 to 70 and get LFR rdy
[2:12:24] indestructible123: is it TW this week?
[2:12:24] mayonaes: guide tells you exaclt what zone and chromie timeline to levle with
[2:12:26] FubarSnafuJJ: There is always a guide...
[2:12:48] gelimarr: RestedXP
[2:12:54] mayonaes: 1-60 in 3 hours
[2:12:58] Troggie: guide - download these 6 addons and win

[2:13:55] AquaJamz: addon
[2:14:00] EdAlegre77: guides help optimize sequence of quests and stuff to reduce travel time and quest rewards. Not necessary but if you want to level up quick it helps
[2:14:15] CeruleanStar: i didn't see any drop off non-fyrrak until last week
[2:14:18] awgyd9: imo retail leveling is really fast and easy. RXP isn't necessary

[4:03:26] failure2: probably the surface
[4:03:39] alphabot357: pop 1!
[4:03:42] failure2: surfaces on cards like that are usually problem areas
[4:03:51] imTymp: he only won like 18 races out of 21 last season hes not that good
[4:03:54] Alaquane: send it to beckett instead?
[4:04:14] MedicineMan: What's the process to get a card graded? Totally new to this.
[4:04:25] Verdell263: Grading is all a scam IMO
[4:04:27] falldrgn: pfft cant even win 20/21 races.. hes trash.
[4:04:29] Kaykerrs: Beckett is really hard to get good grading they are super picky

[4:06:45] Aidler: starting a rating business is all about reputation and that takes a very long time (10 years +)
[4:07:02] falldrgn: damn.. was hoping for some University of Alabama cards
[4:07:20] alphabot357: I hate the people who bitch about PSA but still use them.
[4:07:22] Haestoh: AceGrading is fairly new and successful but I think they just specialise in Pokémon
[4:07:42] alphabot357: I have a TAG 10 Juan Soto RC
[4:07:43] force_FMD: im going to be opera out here, you get a 10 you get a 10 everyone gets a 10 you get a 11
[4:07:45] Eshel: thats a littel bullshitty imo
[4:07:47] failure2: this is what PSA needs to supply to people
[4:07:54] MedicineMan: bruh this is too much
[4:08:03] frankiestein_ii: psa holds the best value
[4:08:13] danoh_64: Thats a bit much no?
[4:08:15] Eshel: "um... seems your molecules are correctly aligned for this space/time continium .... 7/10"
[4:08:37] strike879: its good that it says what is wrong atleast then you know
[4:08:40] danoh_64: @Eshel lol
[4:08:49] Osilon33: good morning everyone
[4:08:49] alphabot357: @danoh_64 But it is a fair grading style. All AI.
[4:10:02] Eshel: too many people trusting AI .... have y'all not seen any sci-fi movie since the 80's ? ..... "fuck skynet"  lmfao

[4:11:50] 775anthonymike: shaman is fun that what im playing
[4:11:53] imTymp: cause people would rather psa tell them they got a 10 then tag tell them a 7 LUL
[4:12:01] alphabot357: I just hate how with PSA you can sub the card 5 times and get 5 different grades
[4:12:20] Allexi88: I have a priest healer on horde that I'm leveling that will be ready to heal the leveling dungeons tomorrow

[4:15:06] megasep007: gotta shoot that shot
[4:15:06] AquaJamz: Beckett is harsher on grading iirc
[4:15:14] force_FMD: the money will get graded also :D
[4:15:14] AquaJamz: compared to PSA
[4:15:16] Prisana: 2000 card and only slipping a 20 theyll rip the card on "accident" lol
[4:15:33] Nahdood816: yeah BGS seems like less 10’s out there.
[4:15:46] falldrgn: your software says its an 8 but my friend Benjamin Franklin says its a 10...
[4:15:51] alphabot357: They will give you a 10 so they can upcharge you.
[4:16:08] danoh_64: resellers go for psa collectors i think dont really care
[4:16:15] pigzip: they would probably grade the $20 a 5 and send it back
[4:16:46] Screamnsteam: Han Solo pog
[4:17:17] Nahdood816: don’t have a Soto rookie but I have a Wander Franco auto I’ll trade you Kappa
