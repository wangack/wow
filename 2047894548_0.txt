[0:19:43] avenueone: was super quiet for me
[0:19:45] avenueone: sure
[0:19:52] skidetko: what's the future for unholy dk?

[0:19:55] Devcomz: Hi Mes how are you?
[0:19:59] Jtrain82: Jtrain82 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! 
[0:19:59] StreamElements: Jtrain82 just subscribed for 35 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[0:20:00] Proffzx: it makes 0 sense, even with DRs how can my haste go down?
[0:20:09] skidetko: im unable to play my off meta cmop to gladiator
[0:20:21] Proffzx: nah
[0:20:27] avenueone: see the new sod p2 stuff?
[0:20:36] avenueone: only a sneak peak into a few runes though
[0:21:03] nikthevoker: sup
[0:21:08] Proffzx: IDK WHAT else it could be honestly. im gaining nearly 1500 haste and my % goes down. gotta be a bug
[0:21:36] Devcomz: You know I am actually happy about the no GDKP
[0:21:41] Proffzx: all 3 of my mages are doing the exact same thing
[0:22:20] avenueone: wonder if it scales with forms
[0:22:29] avenueone: 500% or just base
[0:22:47] nikthevoker: you see no nore gdkp
[0:23:09] avenueone: from what i gather they arent showing all the new runes just some
[0:24:09] avenueone: its not just a healing rune
[0:24:17] avenueone: stuff like exo judge base off sp im p sure?
[0:24:39] avenueone: its a wotlk ret rune
[0:25:18] Anhak: that new shaman rune is the answer to salv
[0:26:02] krome2dadome: i get to rallying cry wooooow soooo coooool
[0:26:30] avenueone: We wanted to provide everyone with a sneak peek at just some of the new runes that they will be able to discover as they continue to level up to 40.
[0:26:33] avenueone: SOME krome
[0:26:37] avenueone: bladestorms coming im sure of it
[0:27:40] krome2dadome: COPIUM
[0:27:56] Anhak: im really curious how redirect is going to work.. cause if you change targets and dont do anything then swap back you still lose your cbp like you lose them when you change targets at all regardless if you do anything.
[0:28:11] Anhak: so is it just gonna work the cata/mop way and is that gonna effect that
[0:30:03] avenueone: whys the wa so outta sync with the nameplate debuff
[0:30:08] Anhak: GDKP is banned that be so intresting
[0:31:21] avenueone: how exactly are they gonna police that
[0:32:11] Anhak: they havnt said yet but i bet it just becomes a reportable thing so people will just have to use discords
[0:32:18] Anhak: and then they get around it and it doesnt matter
[0:32:24] avenueone: yeah all the currency will be traded on alts or something
[0:33:03] avenueone: i suppose people wont stream gdkps though
[0:33:50] Anhak: yea a few ways around it honestly its a good thing tho should increase overall guild desire but it wont be hard to get around likely
[0:34:37] kaounallah: mes, does WA ever give you LUA erros when you press your keybinds?
[0:34:50] Anhak: i like that enchanting is getting probably the best consume? and then like alch is getting stuff too anything to fight the engineering meta slaving is good
[0:35:19] disquared: !armory
[0:35:19] StreamElements: List of Mes' characters here https://pastelink.net/whe2rodz
[0:35:39] Anhak: the one thing i will say is these new pieces do not say unique in any maner so currently even if you can only make 1 you should be able to wear your old ones and the new ones
[0:36:27] Anhak: but they defo should be unique void or w.e or else we probably will still want to use like void gloves especially as a rogue 1 % hit is so insanly valued as a rogue..
[0:36:34] sunileif: mesferal lives!
[0:36:45] sunileif: he is most certainly not been deleted

[0:38:15] Anhak: 22 str 8 agi 69 ap + 50% as for 30 secs for feral is so insane..
[0:38:27] Anhak: yes now they cant chain it but..
[0:38:49] Anhak: 121 ap for feral + the effect
[0:39:07] Anhak: actually north cause im not counting kings or their 20% increase str gain

[2:14:25] Fliigh7z: no i am
[2:14:36] dawsonator171: and then hit me with a kys bye.
[2:14:36] Devcomz: Im actually impressed the man had 1700 games at 1800
[2:14:46] happyheals: I was being nice and making call outs and everyone was good, but this guy decided I shouldnt get a 6-0
[2:15:04] Devcomz: how did he have the time for 1600 games and then he only got to 1800

[2:15:26] eMBeaR64oz: i dont get why people even play at that point XD vid games spose to be fun @dawsonator171
[2:15:27] trollmasta66: the lego buffs are nice, almost doubled the damage
[2:15:36] trollmasta66: wonder how that affects pvp now.
[2:15:57] dawsonator171: they are, that is why I play some of the dumbest shit in existence and people instantly explode.
[2:16:08] Fliigh7z: is the leggo technically bis for melee?
[2:16:12] Devcomz: People do get mad very easily.
[2:16:18] happyheals: I just know that it is gonna be the same as on my druid where I now wont be able to get rating because of some douche nozzle
[2:17:37] dawsonator171: I play one shot shaman, did one shot MM, machine gun boomy, convoke cheeks rdruid. people just are mad inside.
[2:17:57] happyheals: Oh I see, the lock yelled at him in /say and he took it out on me
[2:18:09] happyheals: had to scroll a bit
[2:18:55] happyheals: I need to go on my warr

[2:45:40] dawsonator171: I am not longer healing Dew spellsteal mode.
[2:45:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Awesome
[2:45:58] dawsonator171: he kited about 4 steps yesterday Kappa
[2:46:10] dawsonator171: and I'm shit with mana.
[2:47:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's looking like EU will be using ele again, to a degree
[2:47:19] eMBeaR64oz: sure
[2:47:25] eMBeaR64oz: ill prolly also just be priest for this
[2:47:35] atoker: I feel so bad for you mes, they nerf dk before every tourny
[2:48:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I would assume it was mostly from the data, the nerf
[2:49:33] AethrosTempest: I'd love for them to remove the healing from NW, bake the healing reduction into baseline wounds, and buff death strike a little. The passive healing just seems difficult to balance
[2:49:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Outlaw was under the radar for the most part, many rogues were happy on sub
[2:50:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh I didn't know about their win rate
[2:50:24] dawsonator171: Bedge enjoy the games. I still don't understand how I went so oom yesterday.
[2:51:01] Mcaveryst: bro rogues are all stubborn mules bro they're always gonna play sub unless its nerfed into the ground rogue players are the worst
[2:51:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: They say assa has to have a healer and it's largely PvE
[2:52:06] atoker: I see the top rogues have crit crafted gear, but still have mastery pieces ... is that because they are transitioning from sub?
[2:52:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Assassination reminds me of feral, being like that
[2:52:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: From what I understand the two sets are for different builds that they can run
[2:54:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not really a rogue person, they can explain it better than I can
[2:55:11] eMBeaR64oz: or hpal
[2:55:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah outlaw wants 40% crit, I heard
[2:55:26] eMBeaR64oz: both of em like 2400-2500 mmr tho
[2:55:31] eMBeaR64oz: dont wanna throw cdew into the fire
[2:55:38] eMBeaR64oz: with new toon
[2:56:06] eMBeaR64oz: or you could just go with germainee i guess
[2:56:26] eMBeaR64oz: or whatever other rdruid is out there
[2:57:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood and arcane could work LUL
[2:58:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood might be a sheep breaker, maybe that's really not so viable together

[7:18:13] TartanCass: @Mythh_93 Both really
[7:19:55] Zeshey: does ur rdruid stream?
[7:20:15] Mythh_93: @tartancass lots to learn. Ild start by watching a YouTube guide. What class you play? You want to learn how to damage first - then once you learn that you can implement ccing during your damage windows eg a stun while you pop avatar as warrior etc.
[7:20:24] yourKnightmaare: I wish we had raise abom :(
[7:21:17] Mythh_93: Gesring wise, if you've got gold ild buy greens off the AH if you have no honor. There is 366 gear scaled in pvp.
[7:22:39] wyldeshock: did u find "the" build ?
[7:22:56] TartanCass: is it worth upping it from 415 ilvl?
[7:22:58] Mythh_93: He popped hahah
[7:23:29] bwfp: dhs do illegal damage Sadge
[7:23:59] yourKnightmaare: mes, is it worth pressing the leggo on use in arena?
[7:24:22] Yeabu: Any RBGS ?
[7:24:28] Mythh_93: @tartancass pvp gear scales in pvp instances. If you have pve gear it won't scale in pvp. So no need to upgrade pvp gear no
[7:25:14] Szain3: DinoDance
[7:25:39] eMBeaR64oz: they stole my rejuv at the start btw
[7:26:10] eMBeaR64oz: is it a priest thing? i swear rejuv wasnt on my bar for a countdown of like 15 seconds or something
[7:26:27] ImHomegr0wn: thoughtsteal
[7:26:32] Dudewuut: thoughtsteal?
[7:26:35] SirChrisike: Mr Mes do you have an Eu Account that u use?

[7:30:20] eMBeaR64oz: I couldnt swiftmend at the end
[7:30:23] eMBeaR64oz: because of thought steal
[7:30:23] Mythh_93: Cmon Mike get those rejuvs out NotLikeThis
[7:30:49] Mythh_93: Is this new tech against rdruids
[7:31:33] eMBeaR64oz: it just makes it so you cant rejuv or swiftmend if theres no regrowth out either
[7:31:48] eMBeaR64oz: so youre forced to hard cast if you want swiftmend->big ns
[7:31:58] eMBeaR64oz: or just piss ns and swiftmend
[7:32:00] Mythh_93: Yeah that's pretty big
[7:32:45] eMBeaR64oz: lock was playing pet too so i was tryin to root it behind pillar and clone priest but they had a silence or stun or fade every time

[8:17:09] Blackwidow54: is that sword still available mes?
[8:17:12] Mythh_93: Leave us hpals alone @embear64oz
[8:17:13] eMBeaR64oz: do I boost the 3rd druid? Bopplesr?
[8:17:19] sacothedk: is this supposed to be a quick restart?
[8:17:26] happyheals: I did some shuffles, around 1500 after like 6 q's
[8:17:39] afriKENx: @eMBeaR64oz send it
[8:17:42] Catharsus: @sacothedk just an hour, prolly less than half that maybe
[8:17:54] happyheals: 35-40 mins tops
[8:18:19] Blackwidow54: does anyone know if you can still obtain greatsword of the inferno?
[8:18:26] sunileif: @embear64oz send it fisty
[8:19:03] yourKnightmaare: @Blackwidow54 you cannot

[8:19:52] thepartyzone: whatâ€™s best glad push comp for dk
[8:19:56] yourKnightmaare: yeah np. sorry for the bad news
[8:20:08] eMBeaR64oz: name for third druid when I preorder boost, Boppald or Boppold ? Bopplesr doesnt ring as good
[8:20:24] happyheals: something I was wondering is the percentage heals on warrior. The impending victory is 30% and there is another heal that is a choice with ignore pain that does 8% heal on parries with a 1 sec cd
[8:20:35] happyheals: Do those heals get affected by dampening
[8:20:45] avenueone: tate: Paganbopple sounds like a good name because Andrew Tate fucking said so
[8:20:54] eMBeaR64oz: true
[8:21:19] eMBeaR64oz: I have every other class at 60 already
[8:21:25] eMBeaR64oz: er 70*
[8:21:33] eMBeaR64oz: besides DK because f that
[8:21:37] happyheals: I have 4 druids at 70 and a 5th at 60
[8:21:49] happyheals: I am gonna gear them all boomy
[8:22:46] Mythh_93: Doesn't weckso have like 13 druids
[8:23:20] happyheals: It wouldn't surprise me, he is a leading authority on the ins and outs of druidity
[8:24:22] Mythh_93: I make loads of hpals when they are OP and they always get nerfed pretty quick. Sadge
[8:24:43] happyheals: the classes I like a lot I have a lot of. Like 4 priests, 4 warriors, 4 pallies. Also multiples of those classes on different versions like wotlk and classic era and hc
[8:25:17] happyheals: and somehow I have 4 rogues but I have never played them
[8:25:35] happyheals: just leveled and set it down
[8:26:33] Mythh_93: Learning rogue is just a whole new game in itself
[8:27:11] happyheals: oh I remember. I made rogues to follow myself around in stealth just to kill one guy 1 time and it was worth it
[8:28:38] happyheals: I want to play rogue and ww really bad, but then I don't
[8:29:49] happyheals: I forgot to link this
[8:29:52] happyheals: https://raider.io/news/530-guide-how-to-use-the-tournament-realm
[8:31:43] Mythh_93: I've got one of everything just purely on the basis of learning their cds so I know what to look out for when healing
[8:32:45] americanmoses18: the only classes i dont have maxed rn are mage, druid, priest lols
[8:33:04] happyheals: the 3 best classes
[8:33:21] happyheals: I lie, Mage can suck a phat one
[8:33:31] americanmoses18: mage are scum, druid is too much shifting for me, and idk never liked spriest play
[8:33:50] happyheals: I feel like I look pretty descent
[8:34:09] americanmoses18: i just get all my chars to 1800 to keep up and then wait till next ssn lol
[8:34:17] yourKnightmaare: Drdisrespect: listen here buddy. good luck today. I hope you get that legendary you nerd
[8:34:40] SnakeCodes: Why there is a hate to mage :c
[8:34:50] Mythh_93: Yeah I get 2100 in shuffle on a healer then stop
[8:35:22] happyheals: solitaire
[8:35:31] eMBeaR64oz: what time is awc pregames tomorrow ?

[8:38:48] yourKnightmaare: I still don't know why we ever learned cursive in school

[8:48:24] mettakilla2: Does AWC start tommorow>
[8:48:25] mettakilla2: ?

[8:48:38] afriKENx: Just for fun the sleeper team on eu
[8:49:02] americanmoses18: mes gettin leggo immediately on server reset
[8:49:19] ZealotryTV: are we going full heroic clear or just fyrakk today boss?
[8:49:33] londonheartz: where is brain's team?
[8:49:42] eMBeaR64oz: surely theres enough raid safety marks to get the lego now
[8:50:04] mettakilla2: Im sad the Luminosity players stopped competing. They were not my favorite team, but they were always the wall for teams to beat
[8:50:05] Mythh_93: Last tourney brain said was his last
[8:50:39] Mythh_93: I liked how hidden they were on ladder
[8:51:04] dicromickdk: @Mythh_93 i feel like he was just on tilt after liquid came back with the clutch sweep
[8:51:19] dicromickdk: i would be absolutely tilted too haha
[8:51:44] Mythh_93: Yeah I was hoping it was tilt but seems like they haven't signed up for this tourney
[8:51:49] happyheals: realm list up but offline
[8:52:22] Mythh_93: Brain was amazing to watch with hpal being my main. But he's studying or something I heard
[8:52:37] ZealotryTV: getting at least 3 leggo drops 100p
[8:52:38] ZealotryTV: trust
[8:52:40] londonheartz: what a pity
[8:53:03] RotorandWingDreams: @notmes is brain still retired

[8:54:05] Mythh_93: Against eu
[8:54:12] SuperSunBros64: on heroic?
[8:54:21] ZealotryTV: @wowsumi probably 1 milly+
[8:54:33] yourKnightmaare: every single tuesday I am betrayed by the blizzard wow server status page. always lying to me
[8:54:49] RotorandWingDreams: due to meta you are right this will be more competitive than in past metas for top 8 if lot rogues show
[8:54:57] dicromickdk: no
[8:55:04] ZealotryTV: i dont think its guarenteed
[8:55:08] rtcinema: It has a chance to drop on mythic with group loot
[8:55:08] Mythh_93: I remember mehh and brain spoke a lot. Mehh also quit
[8:55:10] afriKENx: its 25% on mythic i think
[8:55:11] rtcinema: Not guaranteed
[8:55:13] afriKENx: base
[8:55:21] SuperSunBros64: Is 480k prize pool split by everyone or is that just grand prize??
[8:55:52] afriKENx: represents clickbait
[8:55:56] afriKENx: Kappa
[8:56:02] SuperSunBros64: deliberately vague of course
[8:56:22] americanmoses18: i doubt ill see a leggo this xpac for myself
[8:56:31] rtcinema: The prize pools seem so low compared to other esports
[8:56:44] happyheals: they trying to entice the talent
[8:56:49] afriKENx: do you think the microsoft acquisition will effect wow esports at all
[8:56:50] afriKENx: or nah
[8:57:00] ZealotryTV: you mean like selling a toy for prize money and then yoinking your contribution to the pool?
[8:57:14] happyheals: and Corruption is coming back
[8:57:15] eMBeaR64oz: id go to it
[8:57:40] afriKENx: dont follow either of those
[8:57:45] afriKENx: so no clue
[8:57:54] SuperSunBros64: Halo is driven entirely by sponsors I think low prize pools
[8:58:08] happyheals: I thought MAaster Cheif was makin movies now

[9:02:38] Boruox: Morning Mes ,doing any Mythic raiding for the leggo?
[9:03:07] RotorandWingDreams: I think Microsoft will increase prize pools next year to bring more competition
[9:04:32] mettakilla2: We are still in the early days of Esports, I think now as the mindset around gaming and the inherent worthwhile nature of it changes there will be more attention going towards Esports and more people getting involved, just need to get rid of the stigma of gaming being a waste of time.
[9:05:10] RotorandWingDreams: Warcraft with better management can get to if not surpass subscriptions from their earlier peeks in early 2000â€™s

[9:06:34] americanmoses18: microsoft dropping 15mil prize pools bets
[9:06:40] wowsuomi: Elon sacked 90% of staff when he bought twitter

[10:26:52] rtcinema: 7 day lockouts instead of 3

[10:26:56] ZealotryTV: gnomer is the raid for p2

[10:41:54] avenueone: the pull b4 augery was ahead
[10:42:00] tumtuhm: augury is really insane for fire, my 476 beats all the 489 trinkets in sims
[10:42:08] tumtuhm: i need another augury to replace
[10:42:15] dubbfiend: does DH/Ret seem like a good comp in this meta?
[10:42:38] tumtuhm: i have an LFR one
[10:42:48] tumtuhm: goes up to 476, kinda wild
[10:43:03] elysona: I have done heroic on 4 characters every week and have yet to see an augury
[10:43:09] elysona: get an augury**
[10:43:12] happyheals: I got the healing trinket that blooms and puts the shield up
[10:43:26] rtcinema: Most of my toons got their augury from vault
[10:43:29] happyheals: from our run last week
[10:43:59] happyheals: I hadn't seen it and i got it in my only reun on druid
[10:44:03] happyheals: run
[10:44:09] rtcinema: The loot table im pretty sure gives 1 trinket every time
[10:44:19] happyheals: it does 16% or so of my healing in mythioc+
[10:44:41] happyheals: new keyboard and it is hyper sensitive
[10:45:08] tumtuhm: @happyheals i made the jump about a year ago and it's so much better now
[10:45:40] tumtuhm: i'm way more accurate with my keypresses now though for it, not sure it slows me down at all
[10:45:50] happyheals: I have had 7 of these k95 rgb mechanical keyboards sitting in my office
[10:46:18] happyheals: My logitech G910 cord got severed so I hooked this up and not impressed
[10:46:38] happyheals: The keyboard won't sync with icue
[10:46:54] happyheals: so no lighting or anything for a $190 keyboard
[10:47:36] yourKnightmaare: @happyheals I built mine. NK87. I love my board. but I am looking into getting the wooting 80he when it releases
[10:47:39] happyheals: It has 18 gaming buttons on the left that can't be configured
[10:48:33] happyheals: I like those, the only ones I have had issue with is Corsair RGB due to the software issues that are all deemed "unfixable"
[10:49:06] happyheals: i plugged this in new out of the box and it didnt even get recognized by my comp
[10:49:27] sunileif: now to parse with the leggo as heals <,<
[10:49:52] happyheals: I'll give the other 6 out as gifts to people I don't plan on seeing again

[11:04:44] sunileif: am i thinking of cloth >.>
[11:04:45] happyheals: I have been using the helm
[11:04:50] happyheals: It does a lot of dmg
[11:05:31] happyheals: it keeps a dot up for like 27k or something
[11:05:36] sunileif: oh ya the chest piece
[11:05:58] sunileif: my mage has the wrist version its like 500 verse
[11:05:59] yourKnightmaare: they should just change silken to 80% hp
[11:06:04] yourKnightmaare: would be more appealing
[11:07:28] yourKnightmaare: you think shadowflame would do something with leggo?
[11:07:39] happyheals: if you are the attack target like I have been it does great
[11:08:04] biofreaks: oh snap when did you get the legendaey
[11:08:28] sunileif: this is tr
[11:09:05] biofreaks: TSG on TR with double axe lego.. oh babay
[11:09:25] avenueone: i think its only elemental gems i dont think stat gems count
[11:09:34] SporadicLive: yo mes, i noticed in ur WA package u have one for enh spirit wolves, i was wondering why thts a cooldown to be aware of?

[11:10:48] bibitooo: Just arrived, for clawing shadows build, mastery all the way?
[11:11:23] bibitooo: Im at 75% mast with the leggo and 17% haste
[11:11:47] bibitooo: but theres some dr to mastery, thinking of switching gems to vers
[11:11:49] happyheals: if the infurious helm of vengeance wasn't crit vers it is solid
[11:12:19] happyheals: it would be*
[11:13:11] happyheals: I like that the dot klilled a rogue while I was stunned in deep damp
[11:13:20] bibitooo: I'll test some haste gems and see how it goes
[11:14:08] laha1n: laha1n subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! gratz on fyralath
[11:14:08] StreamElements: laha1n just subscribed for 35 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[11:14:48] happyheals: the helm
[11:14:54] soothingmistmonk: play blood
[11:14:57] yourKnightmaare: honestly. we already have crit on our tier helm
[11:15:01] happyheals: it is like perma thorns
[11:15:11] yourKnightmaare: ^
[11:15:58] bibitooo: Its a bit more Vers too
[11:16:04] yourKnightmaare: drop 4 piece and craft thorns helm.
[11:16:27] happyheals: it was consistently 2.6 to 3.4% of my overall dmg
[11:16:35] drfeltgood: @Notmes Do you have any idea how to get the Party numbers instead of the names on raid frames ?
[11:17:15] laha1n: both you AND sam are on rightnow??
[11:17:25] happyheals: what else are you using not in 4 set?
[11:17:43] bibitooo: @happyheals The issue seems to be replacing the chest
[11:17:49] happyheals: ah
[11:17:52] happyheals: makes sense
[11:17:52] laha1n: id figured youd be sleeping my b
[11:17:58] yourKnightmaare: it's unfortunate that the stats on thorns helm are vers/crit
[11:18:22] happyheals: yeah, but at least for me, since I can craft it I already had it
[11:18:36] yourKnightmaare: yeah I had my crafted in season 1 haha
[11:18:40] yourKnightmaare: mine*
[11:18:59] happyheals: but actually took a real liking to it. Felt like when you play with a druid in classic wow and they give you thorns
[11:19:06] yourKnightmaare: just sucks if you wanna run that helm and run 4 piece w/ leggo, you're gonna have so much crit
[11:19:57] happyheals: then maybe it comes down to just dealing with only having 2 stacks of the conduit buff
[11:20:30] yourKnightmaare: I think lariat or helm. depending on your priorities I suppose
[11:20:58] happyheals: have em all ready in case you get trained by fast melee
[11:20:59] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[11:21:20] yourKnightmaare: @happyheals truuu
[11:22:58] happyheals: so Mes, the way they set up the conduit is
[11:23:13] happyheals: They made it proc more often the less stacks you have
[11:23:40] happyheals: to make up for the lower number
[11:24:43] nikthevoker: so hard to find day 3s
[11:26:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: We want max carnage!
[11:26:55] nikthevoker: how high is it in 2s until you get full sweaty?
[11:27:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Just a warrior, but there is that spin2win. And for some reason they don't even use sharpened anymore
[11:29:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: That was awesome!!
[11:29:13] ZealotryTV: summer op
[11:29:44] migliqt: would you play blood walking dead or unholy
[11:30:35] yourKnightmaare: but is 16% noticeable vs 40% even with lower stats ?
[11:31:01] happyheals: so the conduit, unlike the tether only shares with up to 2 people.  I looked at the breakdown and it seems to be around 140 of a secondary stat with 3 stacks
[11:31:05] yourKnightmaare: just wondering what seems more impactful
[11:31:08] happyheals: not that great
[11:31:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: 16% should be noticeable but for sure that's not a huge amount like 40% would be
[11:31:24] happyheals: prob a 40% uptime
[11:32:01] yourKnightmaare: because I'd imagine that 40% might feel better even with lower stats vs feeling strong for 16% of the time
[11:33:22] happyheals: Kickbot, PettyK, and Oql are running boots and conduit in chest
[11:33:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Survival puts up a lot of debuffs, ouch

[11:43:44] diprodigy89: ggs
[11:43:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shadowmeld still annoys me, I can say that LUL
[11:45:12] diprodigy89: fat fingered nether
[11:45:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: One interesting thing is that one of the AWC guys I watch said for rogue, orc is in ways better than night elf because it doesn't jebait them to stay in too long, thinking they have another counterplay
[11:45:35] happyheals: has anyone else had a bug or something with the dragon spittle water not working in solo shuffle?
[11:46:48] happyheals: orc is really good with the stun resist and stuffs
[11:47:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Orc has always had a little of that extra burst and of course passive racials are easier to play
[11:48:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm still a tauren fan but it's mainly for looks LUL

[11:51:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Since I do play mostly PvE and largely on blood DK, that extra tauren health means slightly bigger death strike heals
[11:52:04] anmusallam: mes that was  me
[11:52:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Good win in the mirror!
[11:52:05] anmusallam: gg bro
[11:52:28] anmusallam: could i have done somethign better
[11:52:47] anmusallam: thank you sir <3
[11:53:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mirrors are always a little crazy it can come down to just timing on a few things
[11:53:37] tucker_1998: mes do you prefer claw build over plague, or when to use which vs certain team. my over all dmg between both builds are almost the same every game, claw just feels so much more useful
[11:56:22] happyheals: I feel like mirrors just kinda do there job on the wall. Keep em clean and smile when you look at em
[11:56:30] happyheals: their*\
[11:57:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: He's getting use out of that burrow
[11:57:27] atoker: does this dk not have the conquest vers gear setup?
