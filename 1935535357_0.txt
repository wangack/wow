[2:20:19] 91Niki: @N3llee Right, it depends on how you do it. Purely cometics? No problem. Anything that has power to it is a huge no no. Unless you're in Asia, there they love that shit

[2:20:32] indiegarona: @Molvonos Sounds like you miss me.
[2:20:33] N3llee: My favorite thing about that link is Micro's plan to break Blizz apart and ship IP's to existing studios within Microsoft's org.
[2:20:39] Wulfgrym: This is normal in any industry
[2:20:39] Tooyoo: @Sollice yeah that makes sense. I mean NDAs exist and are important. I guess my point was that gamers don't believe that developers wouldn't share this information with their friends and families.

[2:35:42] 3663Sharad: which will give you the buff
[2:35:46] instant_savage: do u have to be 60
[2:35:46] Nerzalus: Its supposed to be from pots that stack and give you an xp buff and the big buff is 30% after 10 pots and gains duration per timewalk done

[2:38:19] 91Niki: @3663Sharad My guess would be it drops from a timewalking boss, or you buy it at the timewalking vendor
[2:38:37] Yagr6: survival game at blizzcon hopefully
[2:38:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: having it released and Canada but not the US is just strange
[2:39:02] instant_savage: @Towelliee  u know hwat the lowest lvl u can que for timewalking is
[2:40:17] 3663Sharad: @91Niki I hope its that "easy". Blizz sometimes they like to overcomplicate things LUL

[2:40:31] TheUnknowing: i think its like 30 now?
[2:40:40] Tharia: Yeah 35 or 36
[2:40:42] chinfu303: it depends on the timewalking ranging from 30-45
[2:40:54] NobodybetterPat: Doesn’t it matter on the expansion?
[2:41:03] 3663Sharad: September 26 – October 2: Cataclysm Timewalking (require Level 35) October 3 – 9: Burning Crusade Timewalking (require Level 30) October 10 – 16: Legion Timewalking (require Level 45) October 17 – 23: Mists of Pandaria Timewalking (require Level 35) October 24 – 30: Wrath of the Lich King Timewalking (require Level 30)

[2:54:46] SonofHorus82: so, the difference I notice in Towelliee leveling HC and the HC compilations on youtube is that Towelliee doesnt instantly go into panic mode when something goes slightly sideways.
[2:55:01] woohdakidd: peepoHappy

[3:00:36] Nerendis: Feline Swiftness is for leveling
[3:00:42] Nerendis: Are you looking at a 60 build?
[3:00:59] Nerendis: 30% move speed is broken
[3:01:25] tenmillion: leveling definitely takes swiftness at least for lv 20-30. then consider respec at 30 with travel form
[3:01:31] ShinerG: extra threat never hurts thats for sure
[3:01:36] Shrenko: you get travel form at 30
[3:01:40] Nerendis: A classic guide that doesn't value movement speed is actually stupid as fuck.
[3:01:43] raldrik: if you look at hardcore guides they do. Gives escape speed
[3:02:03] Nerendis: You basically have no threat ever. That's kind of the issue with bears. Even geared at 60

[4:47:36] Superhumanjesse: Do they twink or something, with Heart of azeroth necklace/gear/socketed gear and sell Timewalking queues?
[4:47:44] DunzoCD: none of the how to make money vids work because the market crashes after the vid LUL
[4:47:55] pereadin: @Superhumanjesse yessir I always twink when I do my TW
[4:47:55] BennyHaste: buy a juicy wow token to sell for 350k then buy runs KEKW
[4:47:57] Animemron: Why not just buy a 10-70 boost if you are going to pay for the leveling?
[4:48:00] Superhumanjesse: If you get the right gear you're a timewalking god right?

[4:49:04] mavericks312: or is that demo
[4:49:09] zeeAbe: Because they changed the TW dungeon requirements in 10.1.7
[4:49:13] Molvonos: @mavericks312 It's a warlock spell, not class specific.
[4:49:14] ElmSpace: fel domination is a talent
[4:49:20] Superhumanjesse: @pereadin I love like I think the last time I went to join a timewalking raid, I had a lot of good old gear around, BFA neck, legendary cloaks, gear with 3 sockets in every slot, but my ilvl was low so people wouldn't invite me.
[4:49:38] kaeleirra: Fml I left SW WITHOUT TRAINING tobiiiWait
[4:49:38] Take_Knowtz: what level do you have to be to que for timewalking

[5:25:58] dracullus: @aumixp dude it's just wowhead saying 10.2 maybe will happen 7th cause event ends 7th, it's most likely date anyway
[5:26:01] mavericks312: you know an OTK member is gonna try it
[5:26:09] xHukk: LUL
[5:26:14] xHukk: thats actually hilarious.
[5:26:47] aumixp: @towelliee did you see what happend on kick some days ago?
[5:26:50] Masqerader: I would also do the brewfest boss with buff, get that bonus exp from that too
[5:26:57] Allsee_: @rosina_scarlett Yes
[5:27:06] pigbenls: I went to vegas for my honeymoon from the UK. we turned off the strip ended up in a half dive bar half casino with a convenience store attached and 3 huge Samoans with rifles.  It was $1 beers so wasnt too bad. but what a difference from the strip

[5:30:22] CloudPants8081: did mgm pay the ransom?
[5:30:45] Wcvechten: need ferocity for lust ye
[5:30:47] valianya: Yes
[5:30:56] Nerendis: Paying the ransom is typically the worst thing to do.
[5:30:57] kokochris: The feds do not recommend paying ransom.
[5:31:04] aspiration89: KEKW
[5:31:11] pereadin: how much did they get?
[5:31:14] Thoreya: oh boy soon to be m+ dungeon

[5:31:32] pereadin: They shoulda paid and then hired them KEKW
[5:31:35] captivate7: oh no lol
[5:31:36] valianya: Paying Ransom means they'll hit you again
[5:31:36] Nerendis: Here's how ransoming works. "Give me money and I'll give you servers" - give money - "jk im keeping servers"
[5:31:37] Mostdangspy: How much was the ransom?
[5:31:38] captivate7: this is gonna be so bad in m+

[5:32:03] ItsMorecowbell: Caesars prob didn't have the resources or infrastructure to recover, so they paid. MGM probably said, nah, we go this - to hell with y'alls money
[5:32:04] Allsee_: Looks like they still havent fixed Elevator pets
[5:32:07] Niksen_99: Is that confirmed ? @kokochris

[5:32:09] illari_storm: Towelliee Pets going on strike lmao
[5:32:18] kokochris: @Niksen_99 yes
[5:32:19] cabalish: yeah bm hunter bug for years
[5:32:25] Niksen_99: Wow crazy @kokochris
[5:32:27] kokochris: @Niksen_99 the group behind it is well known and credible.
[5:32:40] CloudPants8081: bug report it Kappa
[5:32:54] kokochris: @Niksen_99 it sure is, but that group has hit _alot_ of people this year alone. MGM one of them
[5:33:13] Nerendis: No it's literally suggested by the FBI to NOT pay ransom.
[5:33:16] valianya: Dismiss and resummon, pet pathfinding cannot get off jellyvator, always had to Dismiss on ride up and summon after getting off

[5:33:30] ididntdoitfr: 15mil is less than a day profit for them lol, was nothing for them do pay it
[5:33:36] Korupcija_: HAHAHAH
[5:33:40] CloudPants8081: tppowerFree
[5:34:01] firehawk73: ooof, you NEVER pay the ransom...its not even a "we have the money" situation.
[5:34:08] rymerre: the problem is whats to stop these guys from doing it on the regular now
[5:34:10] Nerendis: So yeah, you gave me 20mil. Thanks. I'm not giving servers back. I mean come on.
[5:34:20] valianya: The problem is once they know you'll pay they'll hit you again and again
[5:34:21] ItsMorecowbell: @Nerendis right, because you're effectively reinforcing the viability of that "business" by doing so. If you can recover without paying, that is 100% the correct course of action
[5:34:26] mavericks312: yea you never pay the ransom
[5:34:30] kokochris: Once the Feds find out about the attack; they will push the organization to _not_ pay the ransom
[5:34:43] mavericks312: FBI literally says never pay the ransom
[5:34:44] CloudPants8081: time for cash only now Kappa
[5:34:51] Nerendis: @ItsMorecowbell Exactly, ask any Federal officer or Sys Admin or Data Lawyer - they all say NEVER pay
[5:35:05] PotbellyGoat: FBI isn't the real world lol
[5:35:07] mavericks312: and ill bet ceasars gets hacked again
[5:35:08] Niksen_99: Did they leave them alone after paying ?
[5:35:23] N3llee: Thats cause they kept quite and only reported it after the got control back
[5:35:25] ItsMorecowbell: @valianya No, they usually don't. That would lead to businesses no longer paying. It's very much a 1-and-done kinda thing more often than not
[5:35:34] xHukk: the attack on MGM likely happened.  Because Ceasers did pay.  Made them think they could get away with it a 2nd time.
[5:35:40] CloudPants8081: towKek towKek
[5:35:42] Redpandalol: social hacking
[5:35:47] N3llee: dont you know someone is fired
[5:35:47] kokochris: @Towelliee thats how 80% of these start
[5:35:48] aspiration89: It's very common
[5:35:50] stin0814: heard it was russian hackers haha
[5:35:54] pereadin: there's gonna be a movie about this for sure

[5:36:07] Ghostzapp3r: Ghostzapp3r subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[5:36:07] valianya: They'll never hit MGM again because a lot of effort for no payout Ransom, and other ransomers will try to hit MGM
[5:36:07] Codeblue2023: no its common for social engineering
[5:36:08] Redpandalol: its kinda common actually or it at least on the rise
[5:36:13] classictwo: social engineering is pretty common
[5:36:14] kokochris: Social Eng. makes up more than half of an attack leading to ransomware
[5:36:14] piratechris: It's actually easier than hacking
[5:36:14] Nerendis: That's not really how attacks work. Some take years of planning. It's almost never some dumb kid in a basement.

[6:20:39] Sollice: Or any other future warcraft titles
[6:20:46] Molvonos: I legit don't think they'll ever create another Warcraft RTS.
[6:20:49] Shrenko: @Sollice Warcraft rumble 😔
[6:20:51] Redpandalol: @Towelliee have you ever been interested in warhammer 40k content?
[6:20:56] CDubTheRIPper: that chris metzen news tho Clap
[6:21:00] Daniel_KB: I meant like the CGI cinematics
[6:21:01] CDubTheRIPper: a little late but Clap KEKW
[6:21:04] MackPlays: How could they continue warcraft outside of WoW, the story has been ruined and conveluted
[6:21:05] DunzoCD: @Sollice ill cope with you, those were my favorite games growing up
[6:21:05] Molvonos: I think Starcraft will be the game that fills that genre, WoW's too entrenched in MMOville.
[6:21:08] Daniel_KB: cause last one chris did was BFA
[6:21:18] neverbornlucky: oh crap elon  musk is already bringing out starship 2.0.

[6:21:55] Keyastaron_: How’s the leveling @towelliee
[6:22:00] Wcvechten: I always like pissing people off saying warhammer stole lore from WoW, gets me some good reactions at times

[6:23:21] Topazspider: I haven't played wow for a while when the next expansion will be announced?
[6:23:27] HAMMERRAZOR: people will still find a way to complain LUL
[6:23:31] N3llee: nah sure the next xpac even after this prob working on pre metzen stuff today]
[6:23:34] Sollice: @ocicatthedruid Is the complaint though with WoD story or content? Or both
[6:23:35] dracullus: ITS NOT METZEN ITS HIS DOPPELGANGER ~someone of 4chan probably
[6:23:41] Metket: i thought you said he was dealing with "classic era" only now its changed right? @Towelliee
[6:23:45] Pallyofhell: classic community on that copium hoping they get classic+ LUL
[6:23:46] extremevf: @ocicatthedruid wod story was not the major problem
[6:23:52] HAMMERRAZOR: not alot same old
[6:23:54] HAMMERRAZOR: you?
[6:24:02] Thoreya: so who makes the story now, metzen or danuser? lol
[6:24:15] MackPlays: Why do we still complain about past expansions they fixed and moved from
[6:24:22] Flebboo: tho i still thought wod had the coolest theme of an xpac
[6:24:24] Wcvechten: I make the lore :)
[6:24:29] enux337: cata felt like altered classic plus kinda good
[6:24:33] ocicatthedruid: story was a problem with how much was cut in alpha and beta, and then the end with "Draenor is free!" nonsense with war criminal Grom :P
[6:24:39] eldritchcoffee: steve still going strong.....sad face
[6:24:46] Shrenko: he gives a thumb up or a thumb down
[6:24:53] Sollice: He may have the last say He is Executive Director
[6:25:01] DunzoCD: when they mention jailer hes the one that slaps them and says no
[6:25:22] Sollice: Yeah maybe it is a money thing to get him money for him to stay
[6:25:26] Deathtronhammer: A title that likely is paying him six figures
[6:25:50] Aidler: Hmm the title says… insinuates that he has the last word
[6:25:52] devildriver1919: bout 111k exp per timewalking with the max buff
[6:25:57] Snabido: That 90% would just go to gameplay bitching
[6:26:03] MackPlays: The novels are the real lore anyway
[6:26:12] frenzoll: Except red shirt guy 😂
[6:26:14] N3llee: i disagree... the next 2 xpacs are likely already written before metzen signed up
[6:26:19] Tundorr: Not even from Red Shirt Guy
[6:26:23] Pallyofhell: the community will always find something to bitch about
[6:26:27] CDubTheRIPper: NODDERS
[6:26:27] DunzoCD: they always find something to bitch about
[6:26:39] Sollice: @Aidler Eh you would be surprised how some of these titles work. I have a Senior VP that works with me, has a higher title, but I have final decision on projects etc
[6:26:41] enux337: sheesh
[6:26:44] Metket: ian KEKW

[6:26:51] PigPenLen: some folks cant agree on anything nowadays
[6:26:53] MackPlays: The only expansion that really needs to be good is the final one. How they wrap up WoW

[6:27:19] Sollice: He isn't my VP he works on the provider side, but I am on the application side so may say trumps his on what we can do
[6:27:22] mavericks312: @ocicatthedruid you just blow in from stupid town?
[6:27:22] Ezcotli: LUL
[6:27:23] reinhardtdog: An executive director at a company though is defined the "highest-ranking executive in an organization, company, or department, with ultimate responsibility for making managerial decisions:"  So wouldn't he be more than just advisorial?

[6:28:31] Molvonos: Classic + isn't Classic, change my mind.
[6:28:33] Aidler: I don’t like Ion either but I don’t think he is going anywhere… he will stay where he is
[6:28:34] DunzoCD: KEKW do it for the memes

[6:30:27] Topazspider: Panda lore is best
[6:30:28] CloudPants8081: you played a panda?
[6:30:32] Nehcrom: I am sure the current leadership can facilitate a good expansion so don't really care who is the posterboy today.
[6:30:35] illari_storm: they had mentioned before when bringing out Classic that they had thought about ideas such as "what if Cata had never happened" So I can only assume they're going back to that thought process.
[6:30:38] Shrenko: Pandaran paladin
[6:30:38] enux337: wow is just too good KEKW
[6:30:41] Pallyofhell: @sniperpotion seeing how classic+ will never happen

[6:31:40] Metket: KEKW
[6:31:42] Keyastaron_: I want legion numbers and grind again
[6:31:44] Metket: true
[6:31:52] Thoreya: DF is good, but its missing some progression imo
[6:31:58] Aidler: We never left Elwynn Forest…. Kappa
[6:31:59] Thoreya: lotta fluff not enough meat
[6:32:02] Shrenko: @Pallyofhell after seeing how sucessfull Twow is I wouldnt be suprised if Blizzard is realizing what people want out of it and actually do a server like it. Other day, there was around 90k players trying to login at the same time
[6:32:02] Ezcotli: Classic + coming  HeyGuys
[6:32:10] Molvonos: Eh, I find plenty to do in DF.
[6:32:10] Onearmyof2: I feel like casuals complain more about the story
[6:32:17] Topazspider: well it won't be about pirates at least
[6:32:17] rymerre: im just tired of warcraft..i wish blizz would have pushed starcraft more instead of letting it pass
[6:32:17] enux337: gearing on point and decent pvp content im good
[6:32:22] Shrenko: @Molvonos same
[6:32:34] ocicatthedruid: grind is fine, timegating grind systems are not

[6:32:36] CloudPants8081: KEKW
[6:32:46] Redpandalol: players unchained
[6:32:48] Metket: i need my anima grind back Sadge
[6:32:55] dracullus: I don't think so, SL had almost no grind but still systems were horrible, you had to pick right covenant, soulbind, legendary etc.
[6:32:56] MackPlays: With 1 character in WoW u run out of things to do
[6:32:58] Nokterian: no island or warfronts there boring
[6:33:02] chrisrev: on the hunt
[6:33:05] BlueBlurPrime: stealth
[6:33:05] geokouts: prowl
[6:33:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: ha tony hawk pro skater 1 and 2 release on steam next week
[6:33:12] Nehcrom: Pet AI could be improved :)
[6:33:12] dragonburza: i wonder when we get raids m+ ( just to differentiate harcores from casuals)
[6:33:13] CloudPants8081: towCringe
[6:33:18] Pallyofhell: @Shrenko like the only reason they did hardcore was to throw a bone to the classic players while they wait for ICC they dont plan on doing new content for it
[6:33:19] Wreckagetv: pet had too much catnip
[6:33:27] oxie73: hunter pets can be special at times lol
[6:33:30] Redpandalol: i just saw the metzen news
[6:33:31] dracullus: @HaxzorJimDuggan oh that's cool
[6:33:31] Masqerader: turn off its prowl/stealth
[6:33:31] Redpandalol: holy shit
[6:33:33] MackPlays: @HaxzorJimDuggan huh i have them on my steam library
[6:33:49] Aidler: I know that Towelliee loves Islands slootLUL
[6:33:58] Pallyofhell: blizzard needs to realize ppl like to make alts
[6:34:02] Flebboo: yep blizz was just stubborn on their meaningful choice thingy
[6:34:08] TweektheProphet: lol Meaningful choice
[6:34:13] mrwaddles22: chris metzan is back!!!
[6:34:14] ocicatthedruid: Yep, SL would have been good, and if well received we might have gotten that middle raid/patch that was obviously cut
[6:34:24] Shrenko: there is other stuff to grind for in Dragonflight
[6:34:25] mavericks312: we get to actually play other games
[6:34:29] Masqerader: everyone loves the grind unless its account wide
[6:34:36] DunzoCD: I still run islands, can make decent money off transmogs LUL
[6:34:40] sniperpotion: the fact that renown hasn’t been account wide by now is insane
[6:34:50] MackPlays: Dip him in and out!
[6:34:54] Nokterian: Also the time gating in SL was just a big no no timegating those soulbinds
[6:34:54] Topazspider: constant teleporting through zones in shadowlands wasn't good either
[6:35:00] Flebboo: Blackrock Caverns for S4 Kappa
[6:35:01] Masqerader: lucky 13
[6:35:05] Metket: bring this dungeon back to m+ rotation LMAO
[6:35:08] Nehcrom: This dungeon contains lots of wipes.
[6:35:27] Aidler: Maybe they do a variant of a future WoW expansion “….the grind edition”… on special servers
[6:35:32] Masqerader: @sniperpotion but the alt catch up at current is more than enough right now
[6:35:35] DRS8Sonic: just finished it, tank had no idea what to do
[6:35:42] xHukk: @Nokterian Really hard to judge SL.  Since it happened during Covid.  Its going to have skewed numbers because everything during that time was delayed etc..
[6:35:53] Snabido: One eternity later, has someone told him?
[6:35:57] Pallyofhell: i hope they do so i can see who dies debuff that kills you if you move
[6:35:58] vaironixx: lmfao that always happens. Doesnt know, lets kick him, not teach him how
[6:35:59] HAMMERRAZOR: to be honest im not a fan of the new dungeon rotation, i like atal dazor and waycrest but the rest are just not for me personally
[6:36:00] MackPlays: Dip boss in and out of lava foo
[6:36:00] Masqerader: lol
[6:36:06] RolexKT: This dungeon is why I dread cata tw jones92Laugh
[6:36:19] DunzoCD: he did the thing Pog

[6:54:52] ItsMorecowbell: I heard it was in Silithus, but I'm grinding rep here right now and there's no sword
[6:54:54] dracullus: maybe they just show sword fallen to the ground under it's own gravity, it's been years in lore since Legion

[6:58:21] s7wede: We needed to have started added new big bads about 3 expansion ago for them to be worth half as much as Arthas and Illidan. That is wow's biggest issue. It seems like whoever is in charge doesn't have a vision for future protagonists.

[6:58:54] Korupcija_: nzoth cinematic so good
[6:59:00] firehawk73: what sword?
[6:59:02] ocicatthedruid: We need a new villain that gets built up over expansions. Someone who is actually a threat that is a fleshed out character (ie not Jailer)
[6:59:05] Wcvechten: The sword gets ripped out of azeroth, a rift opens and it crashes into classic wow
[6:59:07] DunzoCD: @Korupcija_ Kappa

[7:06:16] mavericks312: @Rudric_Ice i mean they make more money then scorsese movies lol
[7:06:20] smashwow: yeah the rifts were good
[7:06:21] Korupcija_: I wish world content is not only for LFR players and pet collectors
[7:06:36] Niksen_99: What tank spec do you recommend as a new player trying to learn tanking? @Towelliee
[7:06:52] CDubTheRIPper: the towBook ?
[7:07:35] Take_Knowtz: where can you track the achevement for the mount for this event
[7:07:47] ArcaneSyntax: prot paladin is the best for learning imo
[7:08:14] Shrenko: DH is the most fun imo
[7:08:15] dragonburza: @ArcaneSyntax +1
[7:08:22] Rudric_Ice: @mavericks312  whats more money gotta do with a good story lmao ?
[7:08:23] Nokterian: Bear tanking is comfy rooComfy
[7:08:43] Take_Knowtz: i enjoy prot paly throwing shields and stuff feels like its easy to keep threat on everything

[7:08:49] duffluv22: Is there an expansion where DH tanks were the meta? Legion?
[7:08:50] Korupcija_: yes but they went too far with AP
[7:08:57] Korupcija_: they can do it and be chill about it
[7:09:00] Wcvechten: ap grinds sucked for alts, esp if you had multiple, for just my main, I was fine with it
[7:09:04] Aidler: Old discussion high M+ players and mythic raider deserve more because they do harder content…. but they are also a absolute minority
[7:09:15] Nokterian: i dont mind grind but the systems upon systems upon systems was just to much
[7:10:03] Rudric_Ice: M+ sucked the fun out of this game
[7:10:15] Yaeger54: Wish it was just justice and valor points
[7:10:19] Metket: @Rudric_Ice da faq?
[7:10:36] pereadin: @Rudric_Ice worst take ever
[7:10:36] ArcaneSyntax: being seasonal is just where most games are at right now
[7:10:43] Yaeger54: No one died to elevator boss?
[7:10:47] Aidler: @rudric_ice I agree but most players seem to like it
[7:10:53] Shrenko: Antorus, no?
[7:10:53] Nokterian: in Legion and Bfa
[7:10:59] smashwow: CN
[7:11:02] pereadin: M+ saved the game
[7:11:09] Rexialiton: Hello Towelliee and chat <3
[7:11:16] foxxys856: @Rudric_Ice that sentence alone feels like m+ wasnt for you
[7:11:22] Cidal_: werent they also rlly good for S1 Shadowlands M+ cause of the kiting?
[7:11:23] smashwow: that was also the best place to have the magic buff too
[7:11:33] pereadin: first MDI they were part of the meta
[7:11:40] pereadin: you either went bdk or veng
[7:11:43] Rudric_Ice: M+ was only fun in legion then they stopped reiterating
[7:11:55] Bixster: i think at the start if BfA, before warriors took over
[7:12:11] smashwow: played a lot of veng in MDI during BFA iirc
[7:12:14] laeenaravenholdt: lol if it wasn't for watching @pereadin I never would have picked up a DH and have had fun ever since.
[7:12:27] sliproach: @Towelliee DH can only be meta tanks if they use the right skills Kappa
[7:12:30] pereadin: @laeenaravenholdt <3
[7:12:40] valianya: Endless grinds connected to power meant you felt you would fall irreparably behind if you missed a day of daily grind so couldn't have time to play or do anything else.  Casual gamers didn't have game play time to devote to staying relevant with the grind so quit for games that gave better time value.
[7:12:42] Snabido: Pinging in a casual dungeon PogChamp
[7:12:49] duffluv22: Account bound currency will definitely help with alts
[7:12:54] darkrowse21: i just started  playing a boomkin
[7:13:25] Yaeger54: Weren't Gladiator stance warriors a thing back in WoD?
[7:13:28] Metket: i wonder what they learned from "DF" when it comes to implement things

[7:13:29] spiritwalker939: towBeer_SG
[7:13:38] Aidler: what I don’t like with M+ is not the difficulty but rather the “rush against time” …. “got to go faster”. That’s not for me
[7:13:47] sliproach: yeah the ping things Anouying AF did a AV 39 people just constently pinging random crap
[7:13:56] herzlustafir: should have been a warp orb thingy instead that for that jellyfish
[7:14:18] DunzoCD: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NqzeOsnBfM&ab_channel=Arkham - these N'Zoth lines might have more meaning now with amirdrassil and iridikron/xalatath
[7:14:21] Rudric_Ice: When was the last time they came out with new dungeons in a expansion it was legion I don't like to do the same ass dungeons over and over again
[7:14:48] ArcaneSyntax: I think they could be a little less predictable?
[7:14:48] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[7:14:48] s7wede: I think the disconnect in perception came from Blizzard not providing a high level system based around skill other than M+ and Raiding. Currently there is no vision / torghast / Island expedition system that should feed the middle ground of players that outgear world content but cannot commit to organised content. Small scale / solo mode challenges.
[7:14:57] Nokterian: its split in two dungeons
[7:15:13] Nokterian: i liked tazavesh
[7:15:29] Rudric_Ice: @nokterian  that doesn't make 2 different dungeons
[7:15:34] pereadin: Legion we got CoEN and Seat monkaS
[7:15:43] starknadooo: I wished they'd add in a world boss rotation like Guild Wars has. Strong enough to be a little challenge. Would add a mid level end game content
[7:16:03] Korupcija_: just increase ilvl of gear
[7:16:03] byrdeen45: GOT A BEAKEN FOR MT TIMEWALKING
[7:16:10] tumb_tack: Visions was just about perfect in terms of group content
[7:16:15] Nokterian: @Rudric_Ice of course it does different bosses diffferent route and layout
[7:16:25] ArcaneSyntax: yeah i'm not sure cosmetic rewards are doing it for casuals
[7:16:29] valianya: Its honestly healthier for the game to allow Casual players to feel good even with limited play times.  More subs with less hours played is better value for company than fewer subs with tons of grind hours played
[7:16:39] Krait06: I just want more cinematics like the ones we got in BFA
[7:16:50] DRS8Sonic: yep
[7:16:53] Nokterian: The fast gearing is great in DF
[7:16:53] Rudric_Ice: @nokterian  lmao what ?? ICANT
[7:17:00] emarol_dk: And we love it . Im casual.
[7:17:04] wowking35: i loved the power something to do but that me.
[7:17:06] mavericks312: if your a casual you cant say 1 bad thing about DF
[7:17:10] s7wede: World content shouldn't make you viable. It should be for the people who have 1 hour a week to play and do something to waste time. It's the middle ground that feeds the slightly more engaged player all the way to hardcore players. They will ALL use a system that they aren't forced to do, but offers enough challenge with minimal rewards
[7:17:24] Aidler: I can do everything i can queue for. Everything else is too time consuming
[7:17:26] icyhawtt: What is project 70?
[7:17:29] Metket: casuals would have 320 gear on their mains if these things didn't implemented
[7:17:34] Vesidian: whats a 'less than casual' lol
[7:17:40] Korupcija_: casuals can do mythic 20s
[7:17:43] Wcvechten: alot of people don't even touch the dungeon finder for heroic dungeons
[7:17:49] Vesidian: cause that'd be me
[7:17:54] emarol_dk: no they cant
[7:17:56] Orczeus: im not a casual but i enjoy being able to collect toys and dragon skins and relaxing lol enjoying old content i missed
[7:18:05] LuiBMHunter: this 56 year old casual cannot do +20's ...
[7:18:11] spookaninja_21: bruh i cant do a 20
[7:18:26] RolexKT: Casuals probably cap at around 10 I'd say
[7:18:28] tumb_tack: I get AOTC and dont do 20s
[7:18:31] Effin_Steffin: so what's the problem? only a certain few allowed to do Mythic 20s?
[7:18:34] RolexKT: Can push higher but most are around there
[7:18:38] theDirtyon3: @emarol_dk i play les than 10 hours a month these days and I did a 20 timed this tier, Used to mythic raid alot but that was 5 years ago
[7:18:38] Rudric_Ice: If you're doing 20s u ain't a casual lmao
[7:18:44] s7wede: casuals can't even do 10's. The average player you will meet in a dungeon is very bad at the game. Those you see in anything higher than a 15 are already in the top 8% of the playerbase skill wise
[7:18:58] mavericks312: yea if your timing 20s your not a casual

[7:19:28] reallygoodtv: got 424 gear never raided or been to a dungeon
[7:19:49] mavericks312: @Rudric_Ice a rare agreeance
[7:19:54] DusttBuster: Towel what is project 70?
[7:20:00] Niksen_99: Anybody knows how fury warrior will do in next season ?
[7:20:05] emarol_dk: Im casual and my highest geared is 425
[7:20:09] duffluv22: Everyone complains. Theres really no right answer. You gotta appeal to the people who has the money. And the majority is casuals.
[7:20:11] icyhawtt: CHRIS METZEN IS BACK ON WOW TEAM!!!!!
[7:20:14] LuiBMHunter: I'm 430 on my main done lfr low M+ can't be assed getting crafted or higher m+ done
[7:20:27] Quojin: personally speaking as a casual player, it validates spending the money on the sub rather than play a FTP game

[7:20:45] chrisrev: i got to 440 and got bored of rerunning m+
[7:20:46] mavericks312: @icyhawtt only classic calm down
[7:20:50] Yaeger54: I mean, I'd label myself as a casual. I'm not in a guild and tend to do the content solo. LFR is pretty much all I do as far as raiding goes.
[7:20:52] Rexialiton: Rexialiton is paying forward the Gift they got from Towelliee to the community!

[7:23:08] valianya: 1% only cares about Mythic raids and 20+ m+
[7:23:25] johniiv: DF is the best to bring back players which left wow in the previous 2 xpacs
[7:23:26] magemaster225: nah its just badges with extra steps
[7:23:57] Quojin: WoW would prob die if all casuals left anyway
[7:24:14] byrdeen45: to upgrade heroic gear what keys do i need to run ?
[7:24:14] SK1NFATHER: off-topic take: BFA has become the most nostalgic xpac for bc of covid lol. i miss it
[7:24:21] valianya: What content gives drake crests?
[7:24:36] darkrowse21: i love being  a casual
[7:24:41] aspiration89: Pog free shot
[7:24:47] icerasta: 5-10
[7:24:53] Scriff_McGriff: normal raid
[7:24:58] icerasta: wyrm is 11
[7:25:02] unowncreature: Too much bag clutter still needs to be fixed
[7:25:02] johniiv: Drake riding. isn't that obvious haha  Killing Proto-Drake also
[7:25:02] s7wede: I don't think DF has many issues apart from not catering to the middle ground / players who are unable to commit to scheduled content. FFXIV gets around this via trials and wow has slightly started to move in the right direction with the trading post and the challenges. Now they just need to expand on it and incorporate old content. A good example of this is the improvement to the Ember Court in Shadowlands in 10.2 Lots more of that will help people find their own niche of content
[7:25:05] firehawk73: wyrm
[7:25:13] duffluv22: Shadowlands had a lot of potential. Ruined by that ultimate choice where you could change factions
[7:25:13] Gingerprimer: @valianya noraml and key up to 5
[7:25:24] N3llee: @SK1NFATHER thats a you take.. no one elses
[7:25:25] MikeyGy: dunno, i feel like any attempt of getting good gear gets invalidated by the fact that in 2 patches everyone can get heroic ilvl gear from killing rares on the map, might be my personal burnout tho
[7:25:29] duffluv22: Couldn't
[7:25:35] Decree22: Did we hear anything about the Blizzcon virtual ticket yet?
[7:25:58] Niksen_99: Is it because of your diet u dont drink atm?
[7:26:01] Aerisot: Didn't they say there would be a mage tower like thing this expansion?
[7:26:05] Aidler: crests should be account wide (at least the first 3 variants) and it would be nice if you could buy higher level crests with a larger amount of lower level crests
[7:26:11] Cafe0le: Mage tower 2.0 waiting room ResidentSleeper
[7:26:23] bapele45: im sad my bear and my ret are bopth fuked next patch
[7:26:24] darkrowse21: i play  every day  and  i  love  getting  achievements
[7:26:32] Zivs: @RagnarSmash  could be this friday
[7:26:47] aspiration89: LUL
[7:26:57] strike879: aidler thats already a thing in 10.2 hit a crest cap and you can buy the next crest up
[7:27:04] SK1NFATHER: @N3llee not necessarily BFA, i miss being able to play WoW all day lol
[7:27:05] Yaeger54: Completely forgot worgens can be monks now
[7:27:15] Niksen_99: Yeah have to be safe. People could be putting stuff in those drinks
[7:27:16] Decree22: @Zivs ah ok thanks
[7:27:26] Mughisi: @Rexialiton Thanks for the gifted <33
[7:27:28] s7wede: I think low level M+ suffers quite a bit from the "meta" so I will agree you wholeheartedly if everybody I currently knew hadn't taken a break because of how hard it is to pug into keys. Once they figure that out I'm sure that M+ will be that system you want it to be.
[7:27:29] Raidr211: lol
[7:27:30] Dred_Scythe: Hilton Bar is a different kind of crazy...although the lines for it get so long, you need a drink to drink while getting a drink.
[7:27:36] Metket: talking about "scheduled things" do you like all events tied on different timeframe? for example every hour time rifts/researchers under fire every half an hour is dreamsurges etc

[7:28:42] Codeblue2023: I do hope to see you at blizzcon
[7:28:56] strike879: low level M+ suffers also allot of the upgrade track higher level ppl cba to do a lower key because if the item they want drops its worthless while with valor they could still upgrade it to viable ilvl
[7:29:07] bapele45: i cant get on my hunter at 437, cant get into anything above a 16
[7:29:22] bapele45: im 2100 too
[7:29:24] tuvotastic: Shaman heals unite!

[7:32:20] Metket: 3?
[7:32:27] theDirtyon3: Honestly classic plus would be interesting
[7:32:28] Scaryrobots: you think there will be a d4 expansion teaser?
[7:32:35] Eithos87: this will be my first time going to blizzcon
[7:32:40] Metket: ah cata included
[7:32:59] Herzenliegen: Did they scrap the survival game?
[7:33:02] Korupcija_: no way anyone in the crowd cheers for classic cata
[7:33:06] Flebboo: its crazy we live in a timeline where Cata classic is on the menu now
[7:33:14] duffluv22: Do you speculate anothee level squish or too soon?
[7:33:17] LuiBMHunter: ooh wonder if tank knows the method for this boss
[7:33:23] Herzenliegen: I was kinda excited for that one.
[7:33:31] Aidler: Metzen will be on stage at Blizzcon all guns blazing
[7:33:37] eldritchcoffee: when will classic shadowlands come out? I can't wait!
[7:33:50] Eithos87: cata wouldnt be classic. cata is when they revamped the zones
[7:34:04] Yaeger54: Warlock cata days. Love to see metamorph back
[7:34:04] emarol_dk: oh no not level squish

[7:34:34] aladinsane444: Do we want Cata Classic?
[7:34:36] johniiv: DH and Druid are 1M +
[7:34:39] Eithos87: I want a lvl squish every xpac
[7:34:45] Aidler: well level squish is bad. That did nothing good in the past. They never can balance old content

[7:36:45] Aidler: The whole expansion will take place in your garrison Kappa
[7:36:55] DunzoCD: definitely coping but cant wait for them to implement housing in a good way, instead of just a money mine like draenor
