[1:45:12] Xeriyo: can you imagine cyclone being in a certain way that you can ALWAYS get an action after it despite it being perfectly timed?
[1:45:34] Xeriyo: that sounds absolutely horrific
[1:45:54] Ripleyxz: @juicyrrr Ye but this is getting boring after some time

[1:46:59] Xeriyo: how is that a false equivalence, you can't make it one way without ruining the other
[1:47:33] voxralol: the bug isn't due to ppl timing it perfectly. thats exactly how clone should work. if you time it perfectly into a reclone, you shouldn't get an ability off rofl
[1:47:41] voxralol: the issue is the delay AFTER it falls
[1:48:13] Xeriyo: but i think the delay is there artificially to allow for seamless cc
[1:48:36] voxralol: so the delay is there in case the druid mistimes his reclone? thats even worse
[1:48:59] Xeriyo: who knows why its there
[1:49:07] voxralol: its there because blizzard does not care lol
[1:49:07] Xeriyo: but imagine if there was absolutely 0 delay
[1:49:09] Xeriyo: the AHK would always win
[1:49:24] Xeriyo: the holyshock would always get out
[1:49:33] voxralol: compare it to retail. if you leave a gap, an ability can be cast
[1:50:00] Xeriyo: not played retail druid in a long ass time, but i guess u can seamless clone there? or?
[1:50:01] voxralol: so you time your 2nd clone based on duration remaining on 1st and cast time of your cyclone. you misstime and the ability goes off
[1:50:33] voxralol: yea you can seamlessly triple dr clone with proper timing. you misstime it and they get the cast off, its your fault not the games
[1:50:49] Xeriyo: ye i mean this is how it was in tbc, or so i thought
[1:50:57] Xeriyo: not sure whats changed between then and now for it to have a weird delay
[1:51:07] Xeriyo: but i can see them being like its ok guys we'll fix it
[1:51:10] voxralol: i assume server lag but who knows
[1:51:16] Xeriyo: -> makes it unplayable to triple
[1:51:42] Xeriyo: warmane had a tbc server, and u couldnt seamless clone on that i heard
[1:51:56] Xeriyo: you would just leave a gap between ur clones on purpose, because even if you timed it perfectly, the global always went through
[1:52:10] voxralol: yea i mean that would be bad too lol
[1:52:20] Xeriyo: very awful indeed
[1:52:23] voxralol: didnt play warmane though. always had high latency when i tried

[4:29:17] Mirlol: @Minpojke i think countergearing is "fine" if u are doing it to make up for an unfavorable matchup, but if ur playing war pala and TC u shouldnt have to swap gear
[4:29:45] Blackbettytv: Yes you should , cause some matchups are unplayable
[4:29:47] Mirlol: my issue is ppl who alrdy play a favorable comp countergearing every single scenario possible
[4:29:51] Mirlol: always swapping talents and glyphs too
[4:30:00] Mirlol: just further increasing their advantage from 90 % to 99,9 %

[4:34:55] Kawaiiti: even if someone wins they all lose FeelsBadMan
[4:34:59] Mirlol: idk im so bored of the countergearing topic
[4:35:03] scorp1onxtrem: rogues should have already MFD on wrath
[4:35:08] skatarin: you cant win . there is nothing more than opinions
[4:35:12] devzyx: @gekkuxz u dont know it's available like overpower, ms and lava?
[4:35:13] Mirlol: ppl who countergear just claiming "everyone would do the same" as if that excuses it
[4:35:13] Blackbettytv: Well you might disagree but your boy Avizura said rmp beats TC that doenst countergear
[4:35:19] Mirlol: the issue still remains
[4:35:22] gekkuxz: i agree @Blackbettytv
[4:35:32] Lurkerxd: my brother was like this, he had 144 hz monitor and was on 60 for like 10 years
[4:35:40] Kawaiiti: at the end of the day what matters is if you won or lost there is no honor in arena , everyone is sweaty.
[4:35:42] gekkuxz: but doesnt apply when pala can tank lich king solo

[4:36:29] gekkuxz: what doesnt happen
[4:36:37] Twhitch: 144 to 240hz is big
[4:36:44] pinatairl: not for wow)
[4:37:25] Blackbettytv: you said rmp > tc doenst apply when pala is tank af,  im saying he's not tanky unless he doenst countergear
[4:37:35] juicyrrr: Generally speaking, the higher a monitor's refresh rate, the more FPS your CPU and GPU will need to supply
[4:37:45] gekkuxz: ofc
[4:37:57] ivan_333: why are u guys talking like wow is a first person shooter, 60 to 144hz is basically zero difference on wow
[4:38:19] gekkuxz: just hope in cata we will get to know who we face in the prep room
[4:38:32] Twhitch: @ivan_333 no its not

[4:38:43] skatarin: and the human racial deleted
[4:38:45] shucoco: Also i dont understand the relevance of the countergear topic, it affects like the 0.01% player base and incolves players that are gonna get r1 nevertheless
[4:38:46] pinatairl: 144-240 is tho
[4:38:54] gekkuxz: might aswell do it since everyone tries to know with who/guild/secondary account

[4:45:39] scorp1onxtrem: you need to shake to win something xD
[4:45:40] Haraw: some people perform better under pressure
[4:45:41] Mirlol: think shaking while playing
[4:45:44] Mirlol: makes it impossible to play
[4:45:45] devzyx: when i wasnt nervous i bombed it kekw
[4:45:46] juicyrrr: ''being nervous is not a thing on lan'' You are basing your entire philosphy on a 1 person sample size
[4:45:50] Mirlol: but if ur a moonkin mby it just doesnt matter
[4:45:54] shucoco: Some get a performance/focus boost from it, some just choke

[7:10:37] rnger: tnx mate :)
[7:10:39] forgivemybad: I liked the RMP you played with Sren and Mir
[7:10:56] rscmadnes: RMP was really good
[7:12:14] icntblvit: @Minpojke akatuski's pal is Kino, not a boost
[7:12:27] Kawaiiti: boost of the lich king
[7:12:28] rnger: shouldnt you win vs boosts?
[7:12:28] rscmadnes: I mean u check lfg for pvp it's only boost
[7:12:54] icntblvit: @Minpojke yea, his name in russian letters means "Kinopala"
[7:12:54] Moobot: www.Twitter.com/Minpojke_ & https://www.instagram.com/jonandersson92/ and https://discord.gg/STTWtwwDet
[7:13:00] glaciationz: boosts extract ppl from pool that would have to queue up normally too its pretty boring, makes there be less casual teams
[7:13:01] aakk122: @rscmadnes why is that?
[7:13:40] rscmadnes: @aakk122 you tell me
[7:14:10] aakk122: what do people play? sod?
[7:14:17] aakk122: or they all just stoped war
[7:14:25] aakk122: *wow
[7:14:25] rscmadnes: we need cata fast to boost some engagement
[7:14:46] rnger: how would you think we could change it so its not a service?
[7:14:51] xarlivenow: u should try elder scrolls online
[7:14:53] xarlivenow: its good
[7:14:56] Kawaiiti: most robust online game for sure
[7:14:59] ear_shot: blizzard would have to actually care @rnger

[7:16:21] benchnote: "popular MMOs" bit of an oxymoron there these days KEKW
[7:16:23] ear_shot: fake as fuck
[7:16:25] Xeriyo: bg3 is not an mmo
[7:16:28] Xeriyo: what even is that
[7:16:30] Xeriyo: list
[7:16:35] magebrotv: i dont think thats right
[7:16:42] jamminlove: 32Million player count hmm ok
[7:16:45] jamminlove: Kappa
[7:16:50] magebrotv: i think final fantasy is top mmo rn no?
[7:17:05] Biggypanda: its a single player
[7:17:11] Xeriyo: no it’s not an mmo
[7:17:24] Johngernaught: Old School Runescape has never had more that 200k people online at 1 time
[7:17:29] Johngernaught: This list is super cooked
[7:17:30] ear_shot: 32 mill players only a total of 25 queing arenas on both na and eu combined
[7:17:31] Mirlol: i just tuned in
[7:17:32] rscmadnes: and acces from retail
[7:17:32] Mirlol: what is this?
[7:17:52] vbx93: rito pls
[7:17:59] jamminlove: s virtually impossible to work out accurate subscriber counts for MMOs today, and this site cannot do that. However, there does exist a need for people to be able to gauge the activity, growth, decline, and popularity of MMOs.  So, we do it based on reddit subscriber information. We track the current subscribers, active users and history of both. This helps you to choose an MMO that has the required "activity" you'd like to see, or perhaps you are just interested.
[7:18:06] Mirlol: wow is so god awful dogshit
[7:18:10] Mirlol: why would it be #1
[7:18:19] jamminlove: "we do it based on reddit subscriber information"
[7:18:23] jamminlove: ye
[7:18:27] jamminlove: the website u were in
[7:18:29] theneverfriendlyone: idk what other mmo has arenas
[7:18:31] theneverfriendlyone: arenas are the best
[7:18:41] theneverfriendlyone: all other pvp on mmos is dogshit
[7:18:54] Johngernaught: Ironforge pro is the closest we can get to accurate player count
[7:18:54] Moobot: playlist !socialmedias !photosynthesis !covenant !legendaries !conduits !stats !discord !macros !ui !specs !restodruid !awc !armory
[7:18:56] Kawaiiti: probably stock price.
[7:18:56] magebrotv: they lost so many subs they probably didnt want to advertise their failures
[7:18:58] rnger: actavision took over
[7:18:58] benchnote: @Mirlol nostalgia goggles too stronk
[7:19:01] Zero_Kelvin: because it dropped to the floor, but they were still earning money, from microtransactions
[7:19:06] Johngernaught: and even that is artificially inflated because of people playing multiple classes every week
[7:19:08] rafidolaa: guild wars 2?
[7:19:11] jamminlove: for arena count you can just make a new char and play a game
[7:19:14] carapilsy: to not scare shareholders I guess
[7:19:15] jamminlove: pretty accurate there
[7:19:17] xarlivenow: lost ark is the closest
[7:19:21] afko: Where to download PojkePriesSelfbuff. Can't find it on wago(
[7:19:31] Mirlol: type 1 if u hate wow
[7:19:32] Mirlol: 1
[7:19:38] jamminlove: ye
[7:19:39] Kawaiiti: 7
[7:19:40] skatarin: probably because people can see how much they make from subs , so it wont look as much of a dick move with the store mounts and shit maybe? dunno
[7:19:44] kenniflopper: i love wow BatChest
[7:19:50] Zero_Kelvin: there were like 550 glad spots s5, there was half of that in later seasons
[7:19:57] kenniflopper: Being sniped by countergear is the best feeling
[7:19:58] Kawaiiti: wow is like an abusive papi
[7:19:59] theneverfriendlyone: you cant make gamers happy
[7:20:02] theneverfriendlyone: gamers will complain
[7:20:03] spaghettijones8: wow players just hate themselves thats' all lol
[7:20:04] ear_shot: this version of wow is dogshit take me back to 2010
[7:20:11] kenniflopper: yes there is
[7:20:21] pvelordtv: stay of execution
[7:20:37] jamminlove: reforge on queue pop 👀
[7:20:38] kenniflopper: let me just say, theres a trinket that u can use that gives u an absorb, if u cancel it it makes u take a dot for 10 seconds
[7:20:41] kenniflopper: so basicly a second trinket
[7:20:42] Johngernaught: I feel like talents are more important than gear swaps in cata
[7:20:45] needmoreNRG: pojke do you stream on weekends?
[7:20:57] pvelordtv: give us reforge mount in cata YEP
[7:21:04] Mirlol: warmane players have made a massive google doc sheet of items to equip for certain matchups
[7:21:08] Zero_Kelvin: skull of impending doom
[7:21:09] Mirlol: along with the perfect talents and glyphs
[7:21:12] skatarin: skull of impending doom?
[7:21:19] kenniflopper: @pvelordtv YEP
[7:21:21] Kawaiiti: DansGame
[7:21:40] kenniflopper: I wouldnt say to the extend of wrath, but this stay of execution trinket is more broken than any countergear item in wrath
[7:21:49] jamminlove: breaks to play rengar top
[7:21:53] jamminlove: this guy doesnt take care of his mental health
[7:22:18] Biggypanda: what do you play besides wow
[7:22:21] godblessJay: @kenniflopper is that available in s9?

[7:23:26] Johngernaught: No more figuring out exactly the right hit pieces to use
[7:23:31] Kawaiiti: on gehennas bauble goes for 5k pve boys dont want it KEKW
[7:23:36] rscmadnes: how much they charge you for this
[7:23:58] aakk122: fact I don’t like about cata is that mage loses haste
[7:23:58] Mirlol: @benchnote ill be back soon
[7:24:06] sgipie: fenleron = Thorstenstock ?
[7:24:13] Johngernaught: @aakk122 what does this mean?
