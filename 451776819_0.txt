[3:58:29] Gmandude: pve gear beeing this powerfull just makes it harder for new ppl to step into arena. Imagine leveling ur character to 120 completely new to the game, queueing arena and getting absolutely smashed every single time since u don't have neck levels and no ilvl
[3:58:30] Onetail123: @saddfase please explain how someone can "be autistic" about something.
[3:58:30] Winterspice: Loony is way better druid than Drainer
[3:58:31] Real_Dope: @DexterStJock if you play arenas 8 hours a day and still not r1 then you are right, but i highly doubt it
[3:58:31] DexterStJock: @saddfase that's true yes, but I'm assuming equal amounts of practice. That was why I started my point in the first place. As Venruki stated 'put more practice in'
