[3:09:15] imrobk: do frost healer with rewind and spellfrost
[3:09:21] g0dzilla: @lacklusterbangarang tailoring and engi... tailoring for bis helmet and engi foir extra dps (nades)
[3:09:21] HoRiiZoN17: i just tried the frost mage healer with chronostatic preservation flash heal spam and its so good, can survive better than most healers
[3:09:51] g0dzilla: @HoRiiZoN17 mana is the biggest issue with that... chronastic is expensive
[3:10:00] OoThomioO: can you die in that 5 seconds?
[3:10:36] OoThomioO: ahh kk

[3:11:50] lowlay0: @g0dzilla thats why u use tailor helm for 50% reduce mana and spam heal if needed to catch up in bg's
[3:11:54] g0dzilla: @stinkywow thats chronostatic thing...
[3:12:07] kaffe_re_re_reformed: they drop both
[3:12:24] manbearpigereeno: all the trolls
[3:12:27] manbearpigereeno: give
[3:12:27] g0dzilla: @lowlay0 if you have the tailor helmet, yea...
[3:12:29] HoRiiZoN17: ya mana is the issue with the flash heal, im able to cast 13 of them before i go oom. i wanna try with mage armor but frost armor with frostbite proc to get melee off you is too good too
[3:12:34] CultJB: ziqoSax2
[3:12:44] NightMunchies: mages have shammys instant cast  thats why i dont play mine no more lol
[3:13:14] NightMunchies: like ice lance
[3:13:17] BuskMan: Can anyone confirm that Arcane Blast is bugged? The 15% dmg debuff seems to not work - only the mana increase works
[3:13:26] HeyHollywould: Good morning, Ziqo!

[3:13:45] kaffe_re_re_reformed: it buffs OTHER arcane spells
[3:13:48] NightMunchies: frost Z's playing
[3:13:54] imrobk: @BuskMan it doesn't increase the damage of itself homie
[3:14:11] voidzyxd: NO ONLY MYSTIC
[3:14:12] wildxsnorlax: i got both from about 10 mystics
[3:14:13] Lolpak007: nah i got it from mystic
[3:14:20] BuskMan: try it please - the 15% dmg is not added
[3:14:22] imrobk: I doubt warriors drop it, but they are shared spawns
[3:14:35] g0dzilla: what are we looking for?
[3:14:37] Mapsize_: @Ziqoftw clear the warriors to make more mystics spawn
[3:14:40] kellydean_: whats a fun melee class for pvp in sod?
[3:14:56] kaffe_re_re_reformed: @BuskMan KEKW

[3:16:29] fafoo204: get the fire wand @infuze27 more practical imo
[3:16:32] g0dzilla: @infuze27 fire...
[3:16:35] godsgiftphini: Do you hae your wildvine gear?
[3:16:43] HoRiiZoN17: Frost channeling talent in frost tree also reduces the mana cost of your chronostatic preservation heal, kinda nice 311 mana. Anyone have a priest and tell me how much mana flash heal costs just to compare?
[3:16:45] pollisand: might be some up above
[3:17:07] voidzyxd: he had something already KEKW
[3:17:22] ObamaEnvy: SOD suddenly got so boring.

[5:12:00] surfhax: yeah, poggers
[5:12:00] body_type_two: so u cant have veins and FF at same time ?
