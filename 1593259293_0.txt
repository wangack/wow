[0:52:05] OwlyOwlman: @magakigr I dunno, maybe. I wouldn't be shocked if DF was the shortest expansion though, especially  if it's good, no bad publicity and straight into another good expac would be a good move.

[0:57:27] BitsyOD: @OwlyOwlman would be rly cool though xbox/microsoft are trying to be the more affordable option than a gaming pc. Hence why they are trying to merge xbox and pc with cross platforming and gamepass

[1:34:24] Badziee: is it 25yd now???
[1:34:25] j3pp3tt0: It's going to go bye bye
[1:34:36] ModIsGod: been 25yd since release
[1:34:52] Badziee: ah thought it was 30
[1:35:02] ShabsieAU: How do you feel if they had had increased healing at less than 25 yds but had 40 yd range
[1:35:04] Fayn1ne: evoker tank spec where you just turn into a massive fucking dragon
[1:35:09] Gurnicus: being mid range does affect encounter design a fair bit too
[1:35:10] sylverlol: !beta

[1:36:29] killuminativi: man you're on early, or late i guess  i'm from the Netherlands
[1:36:32] Tyrou: just put evokers at 30 yd range and you got no problem
[1:36:47] trevomancho: @Towelliee ups sory but evokers have bunch of mobility ?
[1:36:50] Tyrou: 25 is too short, 40 is equal to all ranged specs, 30 is a good middle ground
[1:36:57] ModIsGod: i feel like blizzard expecting evoker to be flying between melee and ranged but realistically the gameplay doesnt allow for that
[1:37:05] trevomancho: @Towelliee wth is probem for them

[1:37:35] Gurnicus: long range boring heals, short range big beefy heals maybe works.
[1:37:36] rustynail_oce: You cant play 25 yards in raids no point even taking one for some fights.
[1:37:48] foofighters182: 32 yards would be perfect
[1:37:50] ijuki: @cozyntoasty and? Not like you get beta by typing !beta DansGame

[1:39:10] Bayne77: you should be fine
[1:39:23] rhafffad: you need to kill him and place a bannmer
[1:39:39] CommanderKrano: after he is dead another one spawns.
[1:39:40] carnage573: 25 yard range sounded okay when it was first announced, but it actually just sounds awful to me now.
[1:39:48] vulraneforot: Another elite spawns when you kill him
[1:39:50] j3pp3tt0: Solo'd him on my dk
[1:39:57] rustynail_oce: maybe they want Evoker to be M+ healer only. 25 yards will be fine in m+ but raids and pvp just wont be good
[1:40:01] Zitaloc: remember when you plant the banner another boss spawns
[1:40:12] ModIsGod: even in m+ there are still problems
[1:40:23] ModIsGod: range not so much
[1:40:40] bassangelgames: when raid testing is going to happen they will increase it to 30 yards range i think
[1:40:46] Mozzeyy_: @Towelliee have u been watching house of the dragon?
[1:40:47] ModIsGod: but the fact that casting your charge abilities immediately spends your gems before the cast is wrong
[1:40:55] carnage573: 30 yards doesn't solve anything though
[1:40:56] ModIsGod: cause if you need to move you have wasted your resource
[1:41:03] carnage573: still would be mid range
[1:41:38] j3pp3tt0: I wish i could make a Tauren Mage
[1:41:45] relaxem80: If this expansion has 3 raid tiers with 10 bosses  I'm going to lose my doggdamned mind
[1:41:48] j3pp3tt0: Name it MooMooBBQ
[1:41:55] bassangelgames: 30 yards with all your mobile skills is a lot better than 25 yards
[1:42:22] nixter93: dude, i relaly hope they fix this bug when you queue into a BG in the air and come out and fall to ur death
[1:42:22] ModIsGod: i cant see them keeping 25yd range
[1:42:31] szble: maybe if the class wasn't a pure caster
[1:42:32] ModIsGod: i dont know anyone who has gone ooo 25yd range, thats good...
[1:42:35] ShabsieAU: I like the 25yd in theory, but it sounds terrible in practice
[1:42:40] teomos: how and when will be the beta giveaways? im have been here for an hour, and no keys informations.
[1:42:47] carnage573: Range has to do with strategies for raids. Evoker will also be counted as ranged so they will still get ranged mechanics.
[1:43:04] Zyanqt: !beta
[1:43:11] Fayn1ne: ranged mechs being closer to melee is gonna be interesting
[1:43:42] Gurnicus: or they'll create mid range mechanics ;o)
[1:43:53] Gurnicus: at which point you don't bring evokers
[1:43:59] BMagicTX: aww man im a JETS fan
[1:44:01] j3pp3tt0: Lol imagine being a Jets fan

[1:45:14] neverbornlucky: what would happen if Blizzard Delayed Dragon Flight release to December in order to do a Christmas release
[1:45:28] nick_____: Thoughts on DF so far? I quit after Castle Nathria. Do I come back or not LUL
[1:45:35] ModIsGod: how can a monk have a 40yd range on spells when its a melee dps yet a caster has 25 lmao
[1:45:47] Nightmare_DXB: !beta
[1:45:54] SavageChancla: hmmm unless for some reason.. they have these raids that are highly catered to alot of movement in mechanics
[1:45:57] carnage573: Monk is also super mobile with effectively smart healing at 40 yards, so evoker being mobile doesn't seem like an argument to me.
[1:46:00] Utsegi: Seems like to get the most out of evokers, you really need to know the encounters. Similar to disc but a bit more extreme because of positioning
[1:46:14] ModIsGod: @carnage573 so true
[1:46:15] K_A_N_J_I: They could just be melee:tank focused healers and very strong in clump situations. Plus I would assume blizz may make encounters to help them shine.

[1:52:21] Deadahead4: seems like it
[1:52:26] gamor12: @Towelliee then do you think we will get the date for DF from blizzard ??
[1:52:28] Tyrou: @DaHirnfetza to start, forcing the healer to be even closer just to heal than any other healer will just push it out of the ideal group due to it not being able to do split mechanics in fights and still heal everyone effectively enough
[1:52:44] szble: soon m
[1:52:45] Bibeln: everytime i watch Towelliee , i want to start play wow again haha

[1:54:09] Honvar: @neverbornlucky No one quits wow forever ;)
[1:54:20] Tyrou: @Tyrou i mean sure, but if you look at current holy paladin it is still able to heal groups just fine and not have to spend mobility to heal the ranged casters while also being in melee
[1:54:26] captiv8: you could do it now
[1:54:34] Red_Dead_Redeem: sorry if you already answered or it's not a good time to bring it up, but any thoughts on NW fresh servers?
[1:54:43] Aeon234: Nagrand supposed to be 64-70

[2:42:29] hack2s: @Towelliee hey, how can I get a beta key from you?
[2:42:42] MissAriella: facepalms
[2:42:50] tronicmighty1: Lol
[2:42:52] MasuraGaming: pretty sure its been that way for. well forever, played since bc and i think its always been that way
[2:43:18] hack2s: I signed evey bet key in their website and I just dont receive a key :(
[2:43:29] KyriaTheMystic: I think needing a sub seems counter-intuitive imo, I'd want to draw back players who unsubbed because they were unhappy with Shadowlands. But that's me, I dunno.
[2:43:35] gouldschild: 😢
[2:43:36] rammeth: Couldnt you go on the PTR without a sub at one point?
[2:43:37] foofighters182: tens of thousands?! KomodoHype
[2:43:42] Layinthawood: thats why it seems wierd to me to only give acess to subs
[2:43:47] zorander01: @Towelliee you also need  to have purchased DF  i tryed to opt in on my other account and i was unable to.
[2:43:54] gouldschild: 😭
[2:44:11] Shrenko: yep my whole guild has beta access except me and another guy
[2:44:14] Cue_Killar: @rammeth You can still play the PTR without a sub. I was doing it last week
[2:44:16] tronicmighty1: Wait he only giving access to subs?? But what about non subs??
[2:44:19] ShadoodHD: i'd most likely get invitied around df prepatch KEKW
[2:44:34] VictoryCH: @zorander01 thats not true. i didnt buy DF and did the opt in
[2:44:41] radagulf: you can get beta without preordering
[2:44:44] Grunton: people are so weird about keys
[2:44:45] rammeth: yeah so its not gonna make anyone sub but still
[2:44:49] Krabas: giving access only to people who drink water, thats illegal
[2:45:04] Akermay: Akermay subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:45:17] evliser: !beta
[2:45:22] KyriaTheMystic: I just find it frustrating I want to give feedback and actually do proper testing but I'm not in despite opting day 1 and having an active sub, while a lot of people who will get beta will faff about.
[2:45:43] gouldschild: Wish I had a beta key
[2:45:47] VictoryCH: when is the next key draw?
[2:45:48] zorander01: @VictoryCH then i am up shits creek i am unable to then
[2:45:53] Tassen95: They have what, 2 mil active subs rn? Compared to 10 mil before wod
[2:45:56] KyriaTheMystic: No for Evoker, Professions, and story.
[2:46:02] Ceroxyo: but my new main is evoker Kappa cant test without beta
[2:46:13] VictoryCH: @zorander01 use incognito/private mode of your browser.
[2:46:13] foofighters182: no homo but i’ll give moobot a blowjob for a beta key
[2:46:20] MissAriella: LUL

[2:47:14] Frippe_TV: dont think we will ever get evoker in ptr
[2:47:23] tronicmighty1: *give moobot poop salad from cult of the lamb to exchange for beta keys*
[2:47:35] KyriaTheMystic: I mean I main DH my feedback was basically soften the cap on Eye Beam/give me more buttons and they did, and all the other stuff might as well be a bag of halloween candy.
[2:48:28] Bayne77: yeah, ive reported a few things here and there, but overall it feels like a playable game
[2:48:35] Crowargus: im reporting any bugs i come across i want that alpha inv again lol
[2:49:11] tronicmighty1: I report a lot of stuff during shadowland as well which is why I want the keys

[2:49:43] SilkeySmooth: havent seen any rogue feedback the class hasnt changed since alpha
[2:49:46] Shrenko: they barely talked to us during SL at all

[2:50:05] EpicJune: what about the giant sword huh? Kappa
[2:50:08] Gutroan: They probably have too, they know their reputation is kinda dwindling
[2:50:22] SjinkoPaladin: could be Microsoft is looking at them atm
[2:50:27] Bayne77: wrong.  my mommy says im special.
[2:50:34] Sasooka: They're more responsive because they know WoW will fall hard if this expansion is also bad. Three in a row would be terrible.
[2:50:39] KyriaTheMystic: Well yeah but honestly reading the blue post on why they nerfed it, most of their reasoning didn't make much of any sense at all.

[2:52:09] KyriaTheMystic: Oh it's not Soar that'll make me not sub, but, if I continue to see a trend of just nerfing inconsequential fun stuff for no really valid reason it gives me less confidence to trust them on bigger things.
[2:52:12] Arabus80: so monk
[2:52:32] Lupusdeus: I think a lot of classes need work in the next 6 weeks.
[2:52:38] SilkeySmooth: rogue hasnt seen any feedback since alpha id be mad if i was a rogue

[2:53:22] zorander01: @Towelliee heh yesterday i said i would gift 5 subs if i win but eh with my luck probably not so.....
[2:53:34] Tizbit: @KyriaTheMystic you take the game too seriously man lol just sub wwhile it's fun and if you get bored unsub? no need to have a need of trust them on anything as you can just stop when it's boring

[2:57:03] sneakyobese: my NAME IS BECAUSE OF KUL TIRAN ROGUES SAME THING
[2:57:12] KyriaTheMystic: @Tizbit What does this have to do with boredom?! They nerfed soar for being 'too strong' compared to conventional flight, when they could have not nerfed it, and just let everyone of all races use dragonflight in all zones like Dracthyr can, once they have it unlocked, making the 'advantage' functionally moot. It's not about boredom it's about these devs who've messed up for two expansions straight, often on simple stuff.
[2:57:20] Apennatie: Sneakycattle

[2:59:24] Tizbit: ya but @KyriaTheMystic what you're saying is you don't want to play something that could be fun because you dont trust it'll remain fun for 2 years? that's like saying you wont buy any other game because you dont trust the sequel being good.. seems silly

I had one of my friends talk so well about classic, even though he had never played classic before, and he was shitting on Retail, and he hadn't played since Legion... Just going with the flow

[4:57:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: The big axe
[4:57:20] SpoofAvatar: there was mass reporting going on in AVs a few weeks back, it was being abused
[4:57:28] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee blizz responded that their system flagged players wrong and that it should be fixed

[5:05:08] riversc17: i switched to Sulfuras 4 days after pre patch it was mostly horde so questing sucked unless you felt like Pvping a lot but i believe now its around 50/50

[5:05:21] luckfore: hes been 24/7 refreshing his bnet last 2 weeks LUL

[5:06:04] holymonke: but like even with a 25 dollar "restriction" for server transfer people still body a single server
[5:06:10] Fappy23: no its a bad cap ngl
[5:06:27] holymonke: i get it, why wouldn't you want to play on a populated/the most populated realm
[5:06:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: The graveyards do help, it's less time running back up
[5:07:08] Shurn_82: @holymonke there are a lot of Fan boy followers that overpop those servers, but most wont play down the road
[5:07:08] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.

[5:09:39] Shurn_82: @Blackicedragoon 2am PST lol
[5:09:42] holymonke: just idk it seems silly to like dilute the population even further locking people to servers. we got classic, som and retail now at this point just let us pick servers like other games let you pick channels. i know not the most elegant solution but i rather that than only megaservers and queues
[5:09:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Heal the bear!
[5:10:00] mikejames01: I never win a AV as horde

[5:30:07] Aorszu: Blizzard does what blizzard wants. This is the way. lol
[5:30:13] JoshStrobl: @wEiRdO_dUdE Except the PC EU ESO server performance is absolute ass.
