[2:04:51] TotallyNotRaien: tres leches is a flavor
[2:05:22] UltraDankNooner: its the three milks flavour obviously
[2:05:38] Zirconn__: tres leches is a cake that will have you question your morality
[2:06:06] Zirconn__: every region in LATAM has their own version , I personally don’t like the strawberry version
[2:06:11] Zirconn__: it’s super easy to make

[2:11:20] Zirconn__: I’d consider it cake
[2:11:30] Zirconn__: it is pretty good I’ll admit
[2:11:55] Sebleh: lucuma is a fruit that only grows in the Peruvian Andes
[2:12:07] Sebleh: it looks like a big avocado with an orange interior
[2:12:30] Zirconn__: it taste good
[2:12:37] Sebleh: I’d say very unlikely in Europe. we can get frozen lucuma pulp in the states.
[2:12:40] Zirconn__: we get those in chile
[2:12:44] Kalrea: Hey nagura, darf ich kurz offtopic ne frage stellen? Geht um nutzungsrechte
[2:13:13] Zirconn__: those things instantly ripe when you look at them for too long so exporting them probably sucks lol
[2:13:22] xeroethehero: Is new moonkin form a raid drop or something?
[2:13:50] Kalrea: okay in english so ppl get it. We played a key yesterday, i made it to a youtube video, we played rise 27 yesterday. I was the silent disc priest. Is it okay to use your face (small in a circle) in the thumbnail?
[2:13:51] Sebleh: it’s not naturally sweet though
[2:14:00] neptufawkes: @xeroethehero it can drop from Tindral on any diff
[2:14:37] Sebleh: @xeroethehero only the fire moonkin form drops from the raid. the other ones are found in the barber shop
[2:14:56] deitos1: @sebleh so its like "cacau"?
[2:15:00] Kalrea: aighty, thanks. best of luck in your 29 dht :)
[2:16:14] Kuroz: ok
[2:16:30] fr00blet: dont forget vortex ok
[2:16:47] Sebleh: you’re past the cats tho should be good to have mass roots for the rest of this right?
[2:17:06] Sebleh: dude I hate that we used to be able to get both mass roots and vortex with the old talents and now we can’t Smadge
[2:18:32] Sebleh: right ijs it’s at least not bad for the rest of this naguuraSip

[3:34:03] Sebleh: what did you do to my streamer?
[3:34:09] GrumpusIsHere: secret to good pie pastry is taking out some water and using vodka, it evaporates faster and makes the crust more crisp

[3:34:26] jwillhue: I’m a big fan of molten brownies
[3:34:46] elldub: Yeah, that sounds like it would be better in a cookie style crust
