[0:53:43] swordart2022: Good my ass stupid excuse
[0:53:49] CritcobainTV: i wish they'd release the 8 Dragonflight dungeons, and some old ones, instead of them splitting it in half. It's silly FeelsBadMan
[0:53:53] pereadin: The stuff he said was a shit excuse
[0:54:07] swordart2022: @critcobain Exactly Preach
[0:54:29] pereadin: If anything the current system they’re thinking of doing with M+ is actually going to make it more complex.

[0:54:58] Thoreya: its just 4 new dungeons are not enough
[0:55:05] Thoreya: its a cool concept but 4 is not enough
[0:55:19] warrenny: Killed it on heroic last night starting anduin tonight
[0:55:20] Niksen_99: Good morning
[0:55:22] swordart2022: @pereadin more boring shit should have 8 and 4 new total of 12
[0:55:26] Thoreya: should be 8 new and 4 old
[0:55:26] uglla3np: nah dude 4-4 is fine with me
[0:55:34] Aervyper: @Towelliee is the dragon race and class going to be just an utter shit show in guild politics on who can main and other BS?
[0:55:37] CritcobainTV: Imagine you put 4 dungeons up, and the bis gear for players is in the other 4 and you can't get your bis
[0:55:41] CritcobainTV: fuckkkk that
[0:55:46] warrenny: @thoreya Yes
[0:55:54] najra1989: then it is not bis
[0:56:00] Jarlan23: thats exactly what max said

[0:56:26] Dirtnose: Paladin one is so good
[0:56:27] icycateye: the druid set shoulders remind me of hfc tier set
[0:56:30] StarbuckTech: Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening all
[0:56:31] Thoreya: ion explained the loot issue which is fine. the bigger issue imo is just the amount of dungeons to begin with
[0:56:34] Shrapnel_Sponge: exactly what specs I thought they were are the right one. the DK set looks sick
[0:56:35] Zansteh: would have never guessed that was mage
[0:56:37] Bestbud: priest looks so good to me tbh
[0:56:38] najra1989: what you think of Monk? Im unsure...
[0:56:39] Niksen_99: I wonder if they make Frost DK the meta since its blue
[0:56:41] mavericks312: best mage set in awhile
[0:56:45] Kize_Gaming: hunter finally has good looking gear slootI slootCopium
[0:56:45] Jokervenom1978: Like the way my hunter will look
[0:56:47] Orthobullet: The dk one looks great for frost
[0:56:53] Dashuria: so much effort in the envoker set and they cant even wear armor in their main form
[0:57:02] luckfore: a dev said they are going to revamp stormwind and orgrimmar harbors
[0:57:34] CritcobainTV: monk set looks dope
[0:57:37] j3pp3tt0: Are you excited for Dragonflight
[0:57:39] xrandomdoodx: Hopefully there is enough time for them to change their minds  on decisions like these with enough community feedback
[0:57:53] raldrik: yes you sail
[0:57:54] CritcobainTV: yeah, that's how we get ehre is by sailing

[0:57:56] BoezIRL: water
[0:57:56] pereadin: Colors = damage that’s why purple is winning right now cause purple is BiS KEKW
[0:57:57] Jokervenom1978: We are sailing there
[0:57:58] CritcobainTV: They said it in the reveal
[0:57:59] TheKitsuneAdventures: on water
[0:58:00] ScurvyHyam: They said wer sail
[0:58:06] Engram08: water
[0:58:06] zigzugg: They're in WoD Kappa
[0:58:10] CanadianCataclysm: it be nice if they just did mythic plus with all 8 dragonflight dungeons. Then just had a random 4 per month of old dungeons. But the loot table is same as dragon flight dungeons and on a 1 month rotation
[0:58:11] pereadin: They’re on water
[0:58:12] TheKitsuneAdventures: they already say we  sail to  the dragon isles
[0:58:14] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Water and they said in the interview we will sail there, and do PVP on the boats LOIL
[0:58:15] Incredible_Sausage: oh good, they're not in a pocket dimension?
[0:58:19] Kize_Gaming: @Towelliee do you think the "old" dungeons they will bring into the M+ rotation will be pre-legion dungeons ? How far back do you personally think they would go ?
[0:58:20] luckfore: we are gonna sail and will be able to fight the horde or alliance on the boats @Towelliee
[0:58:24] pereadin: But we’re sailing there with optional pvp on the way there.
[0:58:33] Dankind64: what dot patch will get the armies involved? i can imagine genn sending out forces to control resources and stuff
[0:58:37] Perseus_IRL: where is draong isles located on the map?
[0:58:42] Perseus_IRL: dragon
[0:58:49] Bestbud: yeah we'll be able to jump to the other factions boat and fight
[0:58:51] swordart2022: war mode on always GIGACHAD
[0:58:55] Technogre: imagine turning war mode off Kappa
[0:58:59] pereadin: Warmode OMEGALUL
[0:59:00] arthasdidnothingwr0ng: playing without warmode is like playing Minecraft on peaceful
[0:59:00] zeviika: fuck ever having war mode on
[0:59:01] CritcobainTV: are you gonna reroll alliance Kappa
[0:59:08] Thdlock: i thought they said in an interview uldaman
[0:59:08] Incredible_Sausage: "not death to the alliance" excuse me?
[0:59:09] CritcobainTV: MOP
[0:59:17] Alepouditsa: it is not fighting it is trolling Kappa
[0:59:18] Thoreya: they said ulda for prepatch
[0:59:25] stresstest: LF DeadMine +20
[0:59:27] TSquadSully: ion gave a few MoP dungeons as examples so i'm guessing at least that far back
[0:59:29] ruhroraggy: DEDADMINES INC?
[0:59:34] reggiepowa: halls of origination could be like a mega dungeon
[0:59:38] Carahail: I know they said at somepoint no SL because they are still so freash

[0:59:56] Kize_Gaming: I mean there are so many great dungeons that are hardly used anymore. Would be nice to open them all up.
[0:59:56] Dankind64: the damn archers
[0:59:58] unicornlover4427: or Grim Batol
[0:59:58] TSquadSully: yes lmao
[1:00:01] Dashuria: yes
[1:00:03] kirbygageofficial: he was talking about challenge modes
[1:00:11] zeviika: it is
[1:00:13] zigzugg: M+ wailing caverns
[1:00:24] mavericks312: grim batol would make sense due to the lore
[1:00:29] zeviika: zigzugg but classic wailing caverns
[1:00:30] uglla3np: uldaman dude
[1:00:31] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Imagine M+ maraudon LOL

[1:00:55] Krue_Sr: M+ wailing caverns
[1:00:59] Thoreya: prepatch
[1:01:08] xFevers: I think its likely it move to M+
[1:01:13] Niksen_99: So in Dragonflight we will be more in Azeroth ?
[1:01:13] pereadin: I’m logging in can que with you
[1:01:14] oraclespyro: how  many man was uldaman?
[1:01:26] rjb11022: I think they should work harder, give themselves a slight break once the expansions out. They failed hard with these past few xpacs, last good xpac was Legion and the last good one before that was Mop. So I think it’s time for a new, fresh start new expansion and experience. I’m really excited for this new xpac and I’ve never been this excited for an xpac in a long time
[1:01:26] kirbygageofficial: for prepatch, buuuuut it could be a m+ later
[1:01:28] najra1989: WLK no LFD, your thoughts?
[1:01:38] Perseus_IRL: is the Dragon Isles location in the south on the map? Does anyone know?
[1:01:53] Carahail: North east of EK
[1:02:02] Carahail: round abouts
[1:02:04] CritcobainTV: I'd be so mad that i can't get gear that's bis cause they're not open
[1:02:05] Kize_Gaming: i agree
[1:02:06] rjb11022: WLK no LFD is a big W by blizzard
[1:02:13] swordart2022: Sounds like Scam
[1:02:19] uglla3np: they said why in the hazel interview
[1:02:21] uglla3np: ion said so
[1:02:25] Dankind64: should just add currency and let you buy any M+ items
[1:02:27] mavericks312: @rjb1102 it's a huge L by blizzard
[1:02:31] Jokervenom1978: I kinda love the idea. but thats just me.
[1:02:35] rjb11022: How so?
[1:02:42] swordart2022: Hope everyone will hate on it in beta/alpha and they revert it.
[1:02:47] Bezroth: Bezroth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[1:02:54] Gillrad: If the dungeon isn't open then the gear from there isn't bis
[1:02:56] rjb11022: I don’t get how it’s an L. LFD leads to things like LFR and LFR is stupid.
[1:03:04] krankyoldlady: just wondering how the million combo's of talets is going to work out
[1:03:20] Kavieonn: How does Dragonflight Rank next to the other expansion cinematics?
[1:03:34] mavericks312: @rjb1102 your not taking into account players on low pack servers or players without friends to play with who may now not buy wrath due to that, LFD was a great qol feature
[1:03:38] zeviika: krankyoldlady probably lot less in player power so its just the illusion of choice in the end again like old talent trees
[1:03:40] rjb11022: LFD should stay in dragonflight not no classic
[1:03:44] OvenMonkeyGaming: @Towelliee idk if ur getting on loat ark today buy uhh lots of big juicer events today i just sent my lancemaster to T3 in 20 min with the mats
[1:03:45] Dirt3y: they already changed the Dragon Race body models
[1:03:46] Spuddy_XL: @Towelliee Did you notice in the cinematic the Titan Keeper that closed off the beacon on the Dragon Isles, was wearing domination armour style runes on his armour? do you think that will go anywhere lorewise or is is just looks
[1:03:57] zeviika: mavericks312 they could also...just make friends in an mmo and not play single player
[1:03:58] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee the blue post basically says that if they bring in mop dungeons for the first season, they'd make sure that gear covers the gear that's missing from Dragonflight dungeons
[1:04:01] mavericks312: @rjb1102 you realize it came out in wrath right?
[1:04:13] Aquadriel: and we still got that awful cypher system and sandworn KEKW
[1:04:22] luckfore: oh please no
[1:04:24] rjb11022: Yes? Of course I know I started in wrath.
[1:04:29] luckfore: let that story die in a fire

[1:06:03] CrimsonNurse: Erosion
[1:06:07] CritcobainTV: Jebaited
[1:06:07] pereadin: Could have been erosion

[1:12:26] 210Crawler: Their moment!
[1:12:35] KingSlayerYotam: my lfr ass is offended
[1:12:39] Aidler: I only need one more protoform companion for the meta
[1:12:44] Thdlock: lfr jailer is a wild ride
[1:12:44] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: is The Jailer LFR a wipefest or a one shot boss?
[1:13:15] digitoxity: someone did that in my lfr today
[1:13:21] Thdlock: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight, its just ppl falling in holes and getting mc'd by los in p1
[1:13:26] Mistery836: probably will be playing LFR at most upcoming expansion because I just don't have consistently time off to raid KEKW
[1:13:49] PanoramicPanda: I was in a LFR group for Sylv last night that took 6 attempts -.-
[1:13:53] zeviika: Mistery836 can always pug heroic, its only H not like m where would need consistent time and progress
[1:13:54] raldrik: 8 stacks for my lfr jailer
[1:14:06] Thdlock: ye p1 has teh holes
[1:14:07] PanoramicPanda: People just kept jumping off the edges
[1:14:08] Thdlock: and the mc
[1:14:28] charmaneultra: Took me 15:31 to kill the jailer in lfr
[1:14:35] Mistery836: @kurijomo you mean pugging it? maybe. gonna be rough to get in though.
[1:14:53] jeflag: massive bang, thats what she said
[1:15:06] balancedlight: I know you love tanking but if you had to choose what would you say your favorite dps is?
[1:15:08] zeviika: Mistery836 not if you start the group
[1:15:23] pereadin: I'm always ready
[1:15:30] Mistery836: @kurijomo that's fair.
[1:15:31] Aidler: there should never be a enrage on lfr. that’s just crazy
[1:15:33] zilzihan: Needed 4 determination stacks on Halondrus the other day
[1:15:40] azzystreams1: I'm not too happy about what Ion said about Mythic + (4  new, 4 old) . I think that sucks, and I hope they change that. It should be at least all 8 with 4 old sprinkled in each season.

[1:16:51] Silverwards: calling it
[1:16:52] amricatt: Officially a long time.
[1:17:00] TacDuc: @CrimsonNurse They said when it's done
[1:17:00] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee They could at least give us the pre-order and the perks for pre-order
[1:17:01] Skars111: might get beta in 2022?
[1:17:06] Dimeric: It will atleast be around a year from now.
[1:17:08] FrankTizzle: would be surprised if it released before May 2023
[1:17:08] uglla3np: @Tai_Silverward sounds reaonable
[1:17:08] zeviika: yeah it just got announced with still a patch in current expac, expecting anything that soon
[1:17:14] ThePawPaw: i want to see more Talent Tree and Profession Tree that we cna start checking them out, as Ion said pepeMeltdown
[1:17:16] dimofodi: As much as I want the new XPAC I don't want it in 2022. I want it done right.
[1:17:20] OceanManCarter: I hope Blizz takes as much time as they feel is necessary. Make DF the best it can possibly be
[1:17:24] Thenickradice: honestly, dragonflight will probably drop at the end of 2023. looks really good though.
[1:17:32] FrankTizzle: Season 3 (current season) is expected to last 8-9 months and Season 4 is planned after that
[1:17:33] Undeadfish12: alpha December, beta April, release august
[1:17:42] ThePawPaw: RDRUID
[1:17:44] ChidaRL: DH
[1:17:46] pereadin: the paladins

[1:18:29] Mistery836: seeing this dps chart and seeing no arms warrior while maining arms PepeHands
[1:18:30] pereadin: mastery is good too though
[1:18:38] ThePawPaw: there is non sv hunter :D
[1:18:51] Thenickradice: love mastery on feral druids
[1:19:01] JediNeo99999: He said 6-8 months not 8-9
[1:19:25] duffluv22: Think I might try tanking. Seems to be more engaging.
[1:20:43] Thdlock: if a fight has a %hp push its inevitable
[1:20:46] Krait06: you ready for spine of deathwing 2.0? LUL
[1:21:00] Thdlock: that sthe best part bout last 4 bosses
[1:21:03] eakiller: tight enrage timers prob
[1:21:04] Thdlock: there is no %hp pushes in theory
[1:21:09] Thdlock: only one is jailers 10%
[1:21:21] bypized: @Towelliee what are betting the raids in Dragonflight to be theme of?
[1:21:23] FrankTizzle: @Towelliee The only way to design fights is to have so many mechanics at the same time that you can't pay attention to all the weak aura notifications
[1:21:33] wetfarts99: I missed the DragonFlight anouncment can someone recap?
[1:21:41] FrankTizzle: Even if weak auras is tracking all of it
[1:21:42] Thdlock: it would have to be time
[1:21:57] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Well every time its a different dps outcome, they cant predict how much dps can everyone do, and if you do it with less healers
[1:21:58] Thdlock: last 4 bosses are all time based pushes
[1:22:00] StarbuckTech: officially at work now lol
[1:22:04] raldrik: more random mechanics instead of timed

[1:22:29] swordart2022: Random and git gud you all intentionally stop playing by own gameplay choice KEKW
[1:23:17] Thdlock: ye i was confused by the 2nd 10%hp nerf to halondrus
[1:23:27] Thdlock: the 1st one was good becuase well it was needed
[1:23:29] Thdlock: 2nd one was weird
[1:23:39] Fanaticqq: @Towelliee can you talk now about the Wrath unlished? :)
[1:23:58] pereadin: I had to swap raid WA's for new guild.  Didn't realize how small they were, spent 3 hours fixing and moving them to my taste smileW

[1:24:17] generalmarcus35: Bafoonary!
[1:24:20] kokochris: "remove addons" towCringe
[1:24:22] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee recreational weed is legel now in Jersey
[1:24:24] yekeohs: if you skip first reclaim, you get 1 minute cds onto the boss instead of the 2.1mill shield. so unless ur comp has cds that arent backup before 2nd reclaim it should be feasable to skip both
[1:24:24] Mistery836: removing addons? no. Making it so you don't need those addons? yes. please!
[1:24:30] Aquadriel: trash BatChest
[1:24:37] swankytygerr: I hope they let us drake our custom drakes with us when we leave the Dragon Isles.  I don't care if we lose the special abilities....I think people are going to get attached to these mounts.
[1:24:37] 210Crawler: That would be too far. I like my addons
[1:24:41] stratiss: unfortunately it will continue to be a massive hurdle for new players
[1:24:49] FrankTizzle: Just gotta design stuff that weak auras can't account for or have players manage multiple complex mechanics
[1:25:02] Thdlock: i mean
[1:25:07] pereadin: I'm not allowed to disclose which top guilds WA's we use.  But they were definitely too small to start
[1:25:11] Thdlock: the only time u needed a weakaura this entire tier
[1:25:13] mavericks312: yall gotta stop this whoe death to addons movement
[1:25:16] Thdlock: was prototype night hunters

[1:26:45] pereadin: I played terra for 5 minutes and stopped. wished I played it more
[1:26:47] c0mmander_starscream: I'm surprised I thought they had a steady community
[1:26:48] Jokervenom1978: My raid group has only gotten 1 BOE in the whole tier.
[1:26:55] bypized: @Towelliee but I do think that one of the things that pushes new players away (to stop playing the game) is the amount of addons that they "need to have" to play and be up to par to the average player
[1:27:02] FrankTizzle: @chilloutpuppy Yes, the majority of the playerbase just play it at expansion and patch releases; many just collect mounts/pets/transmogs
[1:27:07] FrankTizzle: some do LFR
[1:27:10] mavericks312: but yet rift is still alive
[1:27:12] pereadin: @c0mmander_starscream steady community doesn't always bring in the $$$

[1:28:26] Truthseeker96: all these extra addons we use are for other high end content which comes with experience
[1:28:53] Thoreya: we need to get ion to change the amount of m+ dungeons at the start of dragonflight
[1:28:58] DevilSpire: do we still have to do torgahst to get renown?
[1:29:13] vic_ave: no
[1:29:22] Chiphazzord: warthion was in catalog and is in dragonflight there for yes there will be cata stories continued
[1:29:35] DevilSpire: nice
[1:29:49] yekeohs: like echo of medivh
[1:29:51] UlsterFarl: All i need for Dragonflight to be my number 1 expansion is a quest where we spot for Tyrande when she works out her delts

[1:30:19] klindatu: would love to see a model of Neltharion before he became Deathwing
[1:30:24] Dashuria: i mean with bronze drake time travel its possible
[1:30:32] propoopimus: probably because he is hitting one button
[1:30:34] Dyriks: itemlevel is life
[1:30:38] generalmarcus35: Its a skill issue :P
[1:30:41] MiddlePhaze: @Towelliee how many secret azeroth islands are we going to find? dragon isles, pandaria, broken isles...

[1:31:08] Mistery836: I hope LUL

[1:31:32] mmrghost7: lol addons exxploded
[1:31:44] zinbers: The cool thing is going back to the old talent tree but that means there going to be a lot of trolls mocking people on there choose of that talent
[1:32:05] pereadin: BIG ELEGY
[1:32:06] pereadin: KEKW
[1:32:18] The_Boctor: turns out i was tanking with you lol, have a good one
[1:32:22] Mistery836: I'm gonna do a self made tree for sure LUL I'm not gonna care anymore.
[1:32:23] Dashuria: thoughts on having to spec into interrupts? @towelliee
[1:32:36] Tokies: i've been using those forever augment runes for timewalking
[1:32:38] raye_gaming22: no siegel no deal
[1:32:39] EKS90_: @zinbers that still happens with the current talents too. just more of the same unfortunately
[1:32:46] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee You didnt get from A to Zereth achievement?
[1:32:47] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:32:54] doomester: @Towelliee you get Rep from doing LFR?
[1:32:54] pereadin: that's good for holy paladin if its an option lol
[1:33:11] raye_gaming22: druid tree has skill bash so yes you have too
[1:33:19] raye_gaming22: skull bash*
[1:33:23] lucid_wow: it looks like u have to spec into interrupts but healers can also get interrupts that way
[1:33:31] abe4th: well nothing is set in stone yet so you might not have to
[1:33:36] Dashuria: they said you gotta choose it in tree
[1:33:38] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Check it, as you got exalted there, you get a mount for that achievement as well
[1:33:44] fistofnature: @doomester yes you do, both from killing the bosses and the mobs that drop flux
[1:33:50] bd09live: interrupts are talents, same with a lot of spells (wild growth, lifebloom, rip, shred, just to name a few)
[1:33:52] FrankTizzle: @Dashuria @Dashuria @Towelliee Speccing into interrupts was a PVP question from Basheera to Holinka; basically saying there COULD be the option for specs to not have interrupts to spec into it for PVP at the cost of a defensive CD or w/e
[1:33:56] Aquadriel: @Towelliee they need to increase the pace of ZM shit, rep, motes, cyphers too for those needing it.. is really misserable KEKW
[1:34:09] SepticJedi: @Towelliee as a new player, is 2022 too late to get into WoW? Have I completely missed the train with it?
[1:34:12] FrankTizzle: Spelled his name wrong
[1:34:32] vic_ave: @septicjedi it's nit t late
[1:34:36] vic_ave: not
[1:34:41] gergtrongaming: Everything should be account wide at this point
[1:34:44] sinlesssinner: how about the mount?
[1:34:47] sinlesssinner: whats it look like
[1:34:48] pereadin: Ye take your time! :)
[1:34:48] stratiss: the hazel interview is really good
[1:34:51] rohdey: @Towelliee check your progress of A to Zerith Mortis, you could be not far from a mount
[1:34:51] warrenny: @septicjedi No any new expsv is perfect time to get into it
[1:34:52] doomester: @fistofnature thanks alot
[1:34:55] Short_Film: Towelliee about to be on that account wide crusade. towF respect
[1:34:59] lucid_wow: @SepticJedi not too late but it might be better to wait until the new expansion comes out
[1:35:10] mmrghost7: it looks dope
[1:35:11] lucid_wow: the rogue set looks fucking insane dude im so hyped
[1:35:17] EKS90_: @SepticJedi never to late to try something especially when its still actively developed
[1:35:20] bigoldmeatpie: it looks like holy blackhand
[1:35:32] dadbanger1: outriders was a lot of fun for like 2 weeks
[1:35:35] fistofnature: new transmog looks lit POGGERS
[1:35:35] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Check the "from A to Zereth" achievement as you get the mount for that one as well, its connected with the exalted rep
[1:35:36] brewgamingtv: the warrior one has more of the outrider feel
[1:35:37] SepticJedi: @chat ty all

[1:36:42] fistofnature: By Sigmar!
[1:36:57] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: chokema
[1:37:20] hookkz: why am i most excited of traditional talent trees being back HYPERS
[1:37:29] mmrghost7: death nights are raid set is BLUE EUUUUUUUUW
[1:37:35] pereadin: Similar to Skyrim talent trees
[1:37:48] Aquadriel: please give us talent energy POGGERS
[1:38:27] FranciscoTheMage: wht cant we see them close up
[1:39:00] iLanky: Quite interesting can buff passive gain instead of adding actives if you want a less button intense playstyle?
[1:39:01] Aquadriel: no ranks imo, tha feels like a waste of points tbh @Towelliee
[1:39:06] cerealkillas22: SOUNDS POGGERS
[1:39:08] pereadin: non linear scaling to start makes a lot of sense
[1:39:11] stresstest: basicly almost what we have now, just all spread on a tree

[1:39:50] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://bit.ly/35GOQIN towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[1:39:57] azzystreams1: I'm not too happy about what Ion said about Mythic + (4  new, 4 old) . I think that sucks, and I hope they change that. It should be at least all 8 with 4 old sprinkled in each season.
[1:40:08] eakiller: Survival still melee confirmed
[1:40:11] flebbooo: I love this, getting both a spec tree and a class tree feels so nice
[1:40:56] nikodets: Ya, different decisions like - interrupt cooldown reduction vs AOE stun cooldown reduction can make somewhat of a compelling decision
[1:41:23] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT/status/1517127141023965184/photo/1
[1:41:51] reggiepowa: no interrupt KEKW
[1:42:02] pereadin: BRING BACK HOLY PALADIN REBUKE
[1:42:05] CritcobainTV: every m+ player will be like "sorry didn't spec into kick " KEKW @Towelliee
[1:42:05] Imperius_Aeon: how is this a thing
[1:42:07] cerealkillas22: thats what i said
[1:42:10] iLanky: Interruptless dungeon runs ftw
[1:42:13] hatsihansu: that highly depends on how cast heavy the new dungeons are
[1:42:15] roeddogg: Can holy pally have an interrupt again>
[1:42:16] tydrennistv: lets be honest do ppl actually use interrupts lol
[1:42:21] nyro____: yeah interupt should be baseline for sure
[1:42:24] PokerFaceMoose: interrupts work on nearly everything you fight, while stuns dont work on bosses...why would i want a stun
[1:42:24] alextheory_: especially the way they design dungeon
[1:42:25] Meryen33: No interrupts only damage
[1:42:31] Imperius_Aeon: terrible design decision
[1:42:33] flebbooo: mistweaver interupt? POGGERS
[1:42:35] Armdel: now i got an excuse for not interrupting PogChamp
[1:42:35] vic_ave: alot of ppl going to use excuse " not specced into interrupts"
[1:42:39] Velashen: Well it is giving an option which is good. Healers don’t have them.
[1:42:51] Aquadriel: dps focused classes MUST have an interrupt, leave the 'optional' bit for hybrids
[1:42:53] KaisenSiru: Then people will start to complain about too much homogenation.
[1:42:59] raye_gaming22: skull bash boomkin now viable again in m+
[1:43:08] faulen: maybe, keep reading
[1:43:13] pereadin: POG
[1:43:21] vic_ave: import export good
[1:43:22] iLanky: Presume we can change them in dungeons etc dont need to leave to change
[1:43:24] Velashen: Nice
[1:44:17] Armdel: im guessing the spec half will be cookie cutter builds, while the class half is more so "fun" non performance choices
[1:44:24] Clarkerson: They don't seem complicated at all either imo lol
[1:44:51] iLanky: @Towelliee as long is there is no outright wrong options then hopefully it can work rather well no matter your experience (besides removing interrrupts maybe :D )
[1:45:00] Aquadriel: that sucks
[1:45:24] Thoreya: inb4 its just all conduits and soulbinds mushed into a talent system
[1:45:26] CritcobainTV: monkaS wait, u get set bonuses as talents? that's gonna be nuts
[1:45:29] uglla3np: it's fine
[1:45:37] luckfore: legendary effects as talents, sweet
[1:45:50] bd09live: give me holy priest nightwell set bonus plox

[1:46:00] uglla3np: yeah pretty nice. and it will cover all following expansions
[1:46:05] CritcobainTV: I'm even more fucking stoked than before
[1:46:20] bearlicioussss: I love it so far
[1:46:35] MarquisLek: feral guardian inc
[1:46:57] oxidexd: think that's just about pre patch
[1:46:57] Velashen: Yes this is all great. I missed the old trees so much. This feels right.
[1:47:02] faulen: sounds like they are staying?
[1:47:05] TacDuc: They probably only work in Shadowlands
[1:47:08] Armdel: im guessing they would stop working at a like lvl 61
[1:47:27] raldrik: well for leveling in shadowlands they will have to let you join a conv or the entire questline will be dead
[1:47:37] ventu105: Morning @Towelliee and Chat

[1:47:58] Thoreya: idk how to feel rn
[1:47:59] KaisenSiru: SeemsGood
[1:48:00] Velashen: Yikes. I wish they had gotten rid of the pvp tree.
[1:48:03] flebbooo: All good stuff tbh
[1:48:31] Thoreya: big mistake this m+ thing is gonna be. need to be more than 4 new dungeons
[1:48:37] Thoreya: u heard it here first
[1:48:52] vic_ave: pvp players need a pvp tree so idk why you think they remove it
[1:48:56] raldrik: dont forget to change cov
[1:49:48] vic_ave: like legion trinkets?
[1:50:09] raye_gaming22: true fuck iqd
[1:50:12] MOLAR305: what armor class is the evoquer?
[1:50:20] CritcobainTV: mail
[1:50:27] MOLAR305: finally a second one
[1:50:28] ventu105: @MOLAR305 Mail
[1:50:39] CritcobainTV: third mail but yeah
[1:50:48] thatguynamedjans: If theyre aware of how bad it felt to refarm ruby and IQD, why did they never just buff the other trinkets to bring them on par with those so we didnt have to farm them over and over :(
[1:50:58] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Please do it KEKW
[1:51:03] KaisenSiru: Very proper and thorough details explaining the thought process.
[1:51:04] vic_ave: gawd no shadowpan
[1:51:08] Thoreya: m+ temple of the jade serpent
[1:51:09] crittinkitten: I still think this will be better. The high-end might get anoyed at losing a good trinket, but having new trinkets to balance seems way better than using the same trinket for 2 years
[1:51:10] cerealkillas22: not MOP dungeons
[1:51:12] cerealkillas22: MOP dungeons suck
[1:51:14] ventu105: Ion is back
[1:51:24] stresstest: Thats fine
[1:51:27] Short_Film: So will we getting old loot from old dungeons?
[1:51:31] feherlofia123: mop dungeons arent bad lol
[1:51:33] marineboi1288: give me mythic+ deadmines
[1:51:36] ventu105: When patch 9.5 coming
[1:51:39] KeidooTV: sounds good to me
[1:51:45] Thoreya: agreed
[1:51:45] peinen: That’s incredibly disappointing
[1:51:47] Rataplany: yeah 8 at first
[1:51:50] Thoreya: shud be all 8 first season
[1:51:52] Shrubs: Yeah good idea
[1:51:53] Thoreya: and maybe 2 old ones
[1:51:54] digitoxity: mythic plus wailing caverns
[1:51:55] jasonbriggs: uldaman gonna be one of them
[1:51:55] TheFamousManiac: @Towelliee I agree with that, 8 at first then you can switch up the pool
[1:51:55] jamarky23: Thats fucking stupid, and why only 8 new dungeons? 10 should be a minimum
[1:51:56] pk99: 16 new dungeons minimum
[1:51:59] Thoreya: i think 8 is such a low number
[1:52:05] MarquisLek: i feel like all of these interviews have to come with a disclaimer that the expansion is in early internal alpha/beta things can change and we can't even pre-order yet
[1:52:05] FrankTizzle: USE DUNGEONS WITH GOOD TRINKETS
[1:52:11] stresstest: or it will give Dragonflight loot,  just in a different dungeon
[1:52:16] vic_ave: mythic Wailing Caverns...3hrs later
[1:52:16] peinen: @towelliee you’re 100% correct
[1:52:17] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee they are trying to expand mythic plus. m+ has become very exclusive
[1:52:20] pereadin: I'm gonna list us for your SD
[1:52:31] Aggravius: 8 dungeons + 2 old ones
[1:52:31] Roccz27: shoehorning dungeons into rotation not made for m+ is gonna be so boring. trash does 0 mechanics and they arent interesting
[1:52:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: i hate doing the same dungeon next in the next raid tier, i usually lose all interest in M+ then
[1:52:55] ventu105: towLets towGo towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:52:55] balancedlight: didnt ION say something about some of the classic dungeons are also become M+ ?
[1:52:59] digitoxity: or old school Blackrock mountain
[1:52:59] Thoreya: please do 8 new and 2 old
[1:53:01] Thoreya: or 4 old
[1:53:17] Velashen: I would like to see better ways to learn to tank and heal. Whether it is like the brawl. Or like FF14 where you can go in with bots to learn.
[1:53:24] feherlofia123: good point
[1:53:25] mavericks312: that wouldnt be that bad then
[1:53:37] TSquadSully: interesting idea
[1:54:00] Rexialiton: Fuck SD lol
[1:54:00] QuigsTV: @towelliee will you be able to get loot in the vault from the dungeons that won’t be in the mix?
[1:54:08] Chiphazzord: rip key
[1:54:11] Mecabeast: Mecabeast subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 10.0 hype
[1:54:23] Jamdawg: @Towelliee  when you get the chance could you start some research for the guild in LA ?
[1:54:24] luckfore: blizzplanet interview is good
[1:54:27] brewgamingtv: I like SD lol
[1:54:31] DwarfWarrior25: DRAGONS
[1:54:34] Rudric_Ice: frost dk any good this tier ?
[1:54:37] Armdel: @QuigsTV at this point we don't even know if the vault is a thing
[1:54:58] ventu105: @Towelliee what server do you play?
[1:55:00] DwarfWarrior25: @Rudric_Ice yes, its out preforming Unholy
[1:55:06] balancedlight: im pretty sure frost dk is in a good spot
[1:55:07] Aggravius: m+ is like half the game for me
[1:55:13] theos666: @Towelliee I might bee a m+ noob but why dont we have all bfa and legion dungeons in m+ pool (scaled do 60 ofc)?
[1:55:17] ventu105: !server
[1:55:17] Chiphazzord: frost is a top 5 spec
[1:55:30] JeffsStolenBike: Is wowup still good for managing addons?
[1:55:36] KShellZx: M+ Stockades, make it happen
[1:55:47] cryft: i want a keystone system without a timer. i hate speed as the only metric
[1:55:50] TexasSpades: Grab correct soulbind first
[1:55:59] TheGiant99: it's a big part of the game but it is very exclusive and not everybody has access
[1:56:08] MarquisLek: i think the talent tree coming back is pretty helpful largely because of how much more end game there is now compared to last time where its either raid/pvp or fuck off. Compared to now where there's mage tower and mythic
[1:56:14] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: WutFace
[1:56:14] MasterNewt: Filler expansion cause Blizz is dropping this to Microsoft so another bare bones product, 11.0 will be a true indication if this game has any life in it left.
[1:56:15] WhiteKnight74648: thadShakers
[1:56:15] hookkz: WAYTOODANK
[1:56:17] Rataplany: WAYTOODANK
[1:56:17] ThePawPaw: pepeMeltdown
[1:56:20] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[1:56:23] Templexx: haha it just loops and loops
[1:56:25] Warcsman: LUL
[1:56:31] Rudric_Ice: oh no
[1:56:36] veryhairyheyyall: LUL
[1:56:37] Shrubs: Hell yea!
[1:56:38] crittinkitten: That seems like soimething the community could ruin, by demanding access to the same trinket for the 2 year expansion. But maybe thats a good thing
[1:56:40] raldrik: raldrik subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:56:44] HaloS23: @Towelliee Maybe a question for if/when you do an interview: Is there a purpose to increasing the level cap to 70 again or are we destined for another "reach 120 then squish again?
[1:56:58] AMDFusion: BRD M+ Kappa
[1:56:58] veryhairyheyyall: towF good mornin’
[1:56:59] mavericks312: shado pan is gonna be fun
[1:56:59] smashwow: wait what?

[1:57:08] chopsaki: Ion.. I want to have fun playing NEW content .. not running stuff I run hundreds of times
[1:57:10] Chiphazzord: I got gold.mops dungeons I'm ready
[1:57:11] digitoxity: M+ single player challenge modes
[1:57:15] Crazdmadman: Wailing caverns
[1:57:16] mayonaes: With the profession revamp I hope they keep it to where it is expansion specific for leveling it
[1:57:22] balancedlight: i thought you liked Pandaren...
[1:57:23] Aquadriel: all MoP dungeons were fucking awful
[1:57:24] SageRuskiy: Temple of the jade serpent would be great
[1:57:27] Admiller0: Only 4 dungeons at the start right?
[1:57:27] smashwow: all of those shadow pan dungeons were awful
[1:57:34] cerealkillas22: Scarlet Monastery M+
[1:57:34] QuigsTV: @towelliee bring back shrine of the storms kappa
[1:57:36] fistofnature: imagine sanguine on the bridges that keep the souls of the pandaran alive @Towelliee would be a nightmare
[1:57:38] Hawlk: if they are retuning old dungeons anyway, I hope they bring timewalking challenges modes so i can get the gearsets for my alts
[1:57:38] Elff11: ZG / ZA m+ would be fun tho
[1:57:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: BRD M+ full clear lets go
[1:57:41] OmgItsEdizzle: yes like wtf, I want to play NEW content
[1:57:43] ventu105: @Admiller0 yes
[1:57:43] jamarky23: I just cant believe they keep re-using content over and over again and making it a normal....
[1:57:44] DubakuMatumbo: No Bfa

[2:54:47] UlsterFarl: I'm just not convinced that Danuser can tell a good or even a cohesive story.  Hope he can pull it off but not holding my breathe.

[2:55:25] KirbyTheTyrant: We killed them in the elemental plain, they should be dead
[2:55:26] pereadin: Therazane still alive
[2:55:28] MOLAR305: elementals never die
[2:55:32] Technogre: it's wow no one's ever dead Kappa
[2:55:33] MarquisLek: they need the avatar to bend all four elements
[2:55:35] NewWorldReign: Raggy cant be ressed again, another one took his place

[2:56:58] Short_Film: hope we see Chromatus
[2:56:59] GamerKillance: It leads to a ban
[2:57:12] Short_Film: that would be an epic raid fight
[2:57:23] im_n0t_jezus: how much time exactly ?
[2:57:24] MILESkg21: Lineage is still a thing KEKW
[2:57:25] aboringnightborne: I'm gonna make a call now that Galakrond will come back to this expansion somehow (maybe the scourge uprising Bolvar was talking about ressurects him idk) and then we'll have to ressurect Tyr to help stop him again
[2:57:26] doomdrake13: @luisasonza42 the fuck man? Did I not just see you get banned in RDUs stream?!? What the hell are you doing here??
[2:57:29] Mitune: I could see him being at least a final raid fight @Short_Film if not something bigger
[2:57:40] cerealkillas22: 10k years @im_n0t_jesus  since the sundering
[2:57:51] cerealkillas22: thats when the dragons left the dragon isles
[2:57:54] Sielu11628: @im_n0t_jesus DId you not watch the cinematic
[2:57:56] Heero_Effect: Sound cute
[2:58:07] pereadin: they're very weak

[2:58:23] im_n0t_jezus: i thought he was talkiong while we were i nSL
[2:58:24] 3663Sharad: @youmeandgravity Maybe a time travel thing. They already confirmed somehow that the chromatic flight will be involved
[2:58:29] rymerre: killed bro, killed
[2:58:31] honkblarg: what if we go back in the past to fight galakrond like in the caverns of time

[2:58:52] MarquisLek: azshara is coming back and she's the queen of the water dragons
[2:59:00] GamerKillance: Its the current writing team. They are ass at writing and Shadowlands shows they'll just retcon things
[2:59:01] ObsidianHealer: @szble Yep shes in outland iirc
[2:59:02] warrenny: # @mortiousprime yup

[2:59:34] GamerKillance: Didn't Nozdormu show being corrupted? He'll be bad eventually
[2:59:43] reformedalex12345: i hope we will be doing more caverns of time dungeons/raids that would be Pog
[2:59:54] MortiousPrime: @Sielu11628 InterviewER asked about Murozond, InterviewEE pointed out that Nozdormu is alive
[2:59:56] giggz91: @towelliee  can I customize my flying pig?
[3:00:07] NewWorldReign: Wait, didnt Jaina get wtih the leader of the Blue Flights? What happened ot him?
[3:00:14] cerealkillas22: i hope we see the dawn of the aspects and fight galakrond thru a caverns of time dungeon or something
[3:00:14] Sollice: Awesome scenario or dungeon would be traveling in time and playing as an aspect when they were proto dragons. 5 man dungeon
[3:00:25] Sollice: @NewWorldReign He is the leader of the blue flight now
[3:00:27] GamerKillance: They split up @NewWorldReign
[3:00:37] pereadin: @NewWorldReign They were lovers for a short period of time and fell apart due to distance
[3:00:40] OceanManCarter: @Sollice like a modern version of Occulus
[3:00:42] Heero_Effect: I’m the Dragonborn
[3:00:49] Sollice: Yep
[3:01:00] GamerKillance: I swear if they ripoff Skyrim on dragonborn lol
[3:01:03] NewWorldReign: Because he said that the leader of the blue flights is dead.
[3:01:07] MILESkg21: D:
[3:01:11] Sollice: The fightr vs Galakrond at the end of the Dawn of the Aspects book was crazy
[3:01:15] CritcobainTV: Wrathion just needs to make us another cloak KEKW
[3:01:15] Kisswani: nah he's hot , he'll be fine
[3:01:17] veryhairyheyyall: LUL

[3:01:29] luckfore: hey guys! what another cloak?
[3:01:39] MILESkg21: need some more leggo daggers and a cloak LuL
[3:01:47] Kneckt: another cloak @luckfore ? what i miss
[3:01:48] aboringnightborne: Ebonhorn would definitely make the better leader strictly, but Wrathion should still be the leader imo

[3:03:06] Short_Film: Harrison Jones and Brann...yessssssss give me all the adventures with those two
[3:03:08] c0mmander_starscream: Who the hell is Reno Jackson?
[3:03:09] pereadin: Wrathion/Ebonhorn is one of those situations where you have an heir to a throne that has yet to prove leadership abilities, and the other showing great leadership but is not known to be the ideal image of the black dragon flight
[3:03:12] SonofHorus82: Reno is BiS
[3:03:14] doomdrake13: Did we not have Sir Finley in WoW?
[3:03:14] Kisswani: Harrison Jones POGGERS
[3:03:16] Sollice: I think it's such a weird description to lean heavily on the Explorers league groups as part of Dragonflight but do nothing with Archeology

[3:03:33] Todmeister9000: @c0mmander_starscream Hearthstone character
[3:03:38] Mitune: Harrison Jones and the Bronzebeard brothers
[3:03:45] Rudric_Ice: its a NO KEKW
[3:03:56] Mecabeast: are there any characters that are secretly dragons then double secretly dreadlords
[3:04:09] ObsidianHealer: I'd love to see Reno in wow, hes a fun character.
[3:04:23] Mitune: I came half way have they mention the nonexistant sword?
[3:04:33] Sollice: What sword
[3:04:36] Mistery836: the sword?! POGGERS
[3:04:37] rothmir: dip our toes?
[3:04:39] jerexify: @Mitune Not yet.

[3:04:44] Kisswani: ok so are setting things up
[3:04:44] Sollice: lol
[3:04:49] DeanoTV: yeeee boi
[3:04:59] Mitune: ok so the status quo is still intact good
[3:05:09] uglla3np: can't wait
[3:05:12] Mistery836: Like I said. I think they kinda have to do something with the sword with an expansion being about the healing of azeroth
[3:05:17] GamerKillance: pre-patch is likely when people will come back. A lot of people are so done with Shadowlands
[3:05:22] luckfore: cool
[3:05:30] Sollice: We are going to come back and Stormwind is going to be full of religous light zealots
[3:05:32] Mitune: Except there is no sword @Mistery836 Kappa
[3:05:33] KaisenSiru: @ObsidianHealer Him and Elise and Finley are in WoW. They were visitors in Mechagon to do a daily quest
[3:05:34] Murlock07: good
[3:05:35] rothmir: why for some reason all the women paintings have changed to fruit
[3:05:36] Decoy101: did they confirm anything about a time skip or something coming back from the shadowlands?
[3:05:41] Rudric_Ice: he doesn't even talk about the sword
[3:05:45] luckfore: @Mistery836 what sword?
[3:05:45] Heero_Effect: I’m really interested in the story so far
[3:05:45] Mistery836: @Mitune  Kappa
[3:05:48] BTiZZY_: @gamerkillance there’s a lot of people coming back rn :)
[3:05:49] Rudric_Ice: waow ok
[3:06:01] boopbopbamski: I am very excited for the new crafting Pog i am just wondering if the new work order stuff is only for the new content or all content in the game
[3:06:07] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:06:11] darssia_: we drained all the power from the sword it's fine just forget the sword lol.
[3:06:14] Heero_Effect: @gamerkillance ha probably. Once I’m done with SFO heroic I’m done until we get close to dragon flight
[3:06:34] boopbopbamski: can ppl put in work orders to have some tmog from classic tbc wotlk crafted
[3:06:34] GamerKillance: @BTiZZY_ We've seen more come back from previous expacs. Im not saying there aren't players, but its ignorant to think Shadowlands is doing well in retrospec to the other expansions around this time
[3:06:46] CritcobainTV: alpha and baiter FeelsGoodMan
[3:06:55] BTiZZY_: no one said shadowlands is doing great rn lol @gamerkillance
[3:06:56] Sollice: I wish I was a baiter
[3:07:10] MarquisLek: fishing legendary returns, time for dragon fishing

[3:09:18] kckillakrack: I feel like the majority if wow players are very ungrateful people who are nothing more than chronic complainers
[3:09:19] Alepouditsa: does that mean the may be 3 in one place? or just 1 danHmm
[3:09:22] rothmir: WutFace WutFace WutFace

[3:09:27] Mitune: Think that the super rare drops boe will have updated higher ilvl versions  coxBut
[3:09:29] AveragePvp: Super items re done? Maybe
[3:09:45] Kisswani: POGGERS
[3:09:51] KaisenSiru: Yes, Uldamon has connections with Titan Discs. It makes sense its included
[3:09:52] MarquisLek: uldaman yet again
[3:09:59] Rohen86: SAME
[3:10:00] olissipotv: who liked uldaman? what? Of every dungeon why that one?
[3:10:01] jiffypawp: Original uldaman had great vibes as a dig site with the huge map room and stuff. Good choice for redo
[3:10:03] CardinalTX: The discs of frisbee
[3:10:04] GamerKillance: @kckillakrack No Shadowlands showed they don't listen to players. Wasn't until recently they started listening again due to players leaving in doves after the lawsuit
[3:10:05] Aquadriel: is gargalon
[3:10:06] ObsidianHealer: Same here

[3:10:11] Sarocus: You're saying it wrong :)
[3:10:11] MarquisLek: i always called norgannon
[3:10:12] aboringnightborne: The way they pronounce it is correct
[3:10:14] Mitune: Everyone calls what they want
[3:10:16] KirbyTheTyrant: You're pronouncing it right
[3:10:18] egraves7: i've always heard it the way he says it

[3:10:40] Manyfist: I’d love them to revisit old vanilla dungeons

[3:11:09] jasonbriggs: nprgamon deez nuts
[3:11:16] swordart2022: So far lame interview
[3:11:21] Kisswani: good interview but why is he asking Danuser this ? KEKW
[3:11:27] Aquadriel: no shitting on this guy at all, but why is he asking system stuff to the guy who focuses on lore?
[3:11:28] boopbopbamski: HIGH FIVE
[3:11:45] Heero_Effect: Towelie in trouble
[3:11:46] GamerKillance: The problem is systems and borrowed power honestly. If they double down on that then its will be a pass for me. I don't have time for that
[3:12:02] Sielu11628: @GamerKillance You're not listening then
[3:12:04] MILESkg21: The Great UN-PRUNING
[3:12:05] Kisswani: @GamerKillance did you watch the reveal ?
[3:12:17] GamerKillance: They said things before and gone back on it
[3:12:18] Rudric_Ice: why is he asking the lore guy about game systems ?
[3:12:24] GamerKillance: Which is why im hesitent to believe
[3:12:25] duffluv22: Cant wait for the Preach and Ion interview...lol

[3:12:54] akia03: @duffluv22 preach declined the interview
[3:13:16] Manyfist: 2023 or 2024?
[3:13:24] Mistery836: w8. why did preach decline? because he went to ffxiv now?
[3:13:32] GamerKillance: Its why I keep saying im waiting for beta. It'll show what they are putting in the game. Blizzard is known for not doing what they say they'll do
[3:13:51] Rudric_Ice: N OMEGALUL
[3:13:57] MILESkg21: so NO KEKW
[3:14:02] Ambersulfr: let me pre-order towCry

[3:14:26] KingSlayerYotam: After the last interview, i dont think preach wanna be restricted with questions again
[3:14:28] swordart2022: Like more customisation???
[3:14:32] ObsidianHealer: KEKW
[3:14:36] boopbopbamski: miss play on the new class color wish it wasnt teal
[3:14:36] MILESkg21: KEKW NICE
[3:14:39] GamerKillance: Ya current WoW made a lot of people quit. It just isn't in a good spot
[3:14:39] szble: yeah class color is an L
[3:14:41] kay0234: LUL
[3:14:43] swordart2022: What are these questions literally all same KEKW
[3:14:45] Lockrocker: unique class set looks as well. I dont want my Warlock looking like Priests and Mages
[3:14:50] The_Farting_Spaniard: Looks like an out  of range monk color
[3:14:51] JavLive: "Navy Green"
[3:14:51] bigpppower527: moss green maybe?
[3:14:52] Todmeister9000: Teal
[3:14:53] Velashen: Teal.
[3:14:58] Elornne: more of a sage
[3:15:00] pereadin: Shoulda made it gray imo
[3:15:01] MILESkg21: Clap
[3:15:01] boopbopbamski: teal = miss play
[3:15:02] KaisenSiru: Teal looks great.
[3:15:04] jiffypawp: Looks like a light forest green
[3:15:05] ObsidianHealer: is it teal? it looked more like a moss
[3:15:14] boopbopbamski: no BLACK class color? monkaHmm
[3:15:14] Kisswani: Clap
[3:15:15] im_capy: good interview for sure
[3:15:17] uglla3np: dark teal
[3:15:17] Manyfist: Should’ve been a rainbow KappaPride
[3:15:17] Ambersulfr: because we totally need another green
[3:15:22] assman_ny: That was a good one
[3:15:24] Rohen86: It's Norgannon not Norgannon
[3:15:27] GamerKillance: Elements and Dragons
[3:15:28] Mecabeast: I thought it was almost a forest green
[3:15:29] Vile_: Vile_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 30 whole months? Pog
[3:15:30] Leystra: Just popped in, what was that interview?
[3:15:30] kaelibwow: Why haven’t they talked about the dragon covenants yet?
[3:15:32] GamerKillance: (I can get behind it
[3:15:35] Mitune: I hope they get the Talent calculators out super soon
[3:15:44] Todmeister9000: I am so hyped for 10.0
[3:15:44] Aquadriel: like 5 more
[3:15:45] The_Dane_Train: Random thought: I think they could let Evokers be other races by being in idragon form in combat and the race as their humanoid form AND let dracthyr be other classes by just fighting in humanoid form. Thoughts?
[3:15:59] Manyfist: We’re still in cosmic. With the Titans.
[3:16:03] Ambersulfr: yea, if you're completing enough keys closely
[3:16:04] Velzenx: This expansion is gonna be my fav. I know it already
[3:16:05] Aquadriel: you can get 3k by depleting half of your 20s
[3:16:11] KirbyTheTyrant: Only if the fail is close
[3:16:30] sverrewtf: i kinda wish evoker could also tank tbh, mail tank boi
[3:16:31] KirbyTheTyrant: If the fail is too far off you get nothing
[3:16:35] Sollice: Chat- I am a normal player and not looking to be the end all of be all. Is Arms viable?
[3:16:43] Velzenx: Yes plz
[3:16:44] Velzenx: <3
[3:16:46] kaelibwow: It’s based on time not completion for score
[3:16:50] Manyfist: @sverrewtf Ranged tank?

[3:18:10] KaisenSiru: @Sollice Arms is fine. It depends how much you like the play style or not
[3:18:22] Mitune: Honestly, they probably should send out free 14 day time for every major patch if there is a huge drop in subs. Just make sense to maybe get some people back
[3:18:50] Sollice: Looks like I need to go Kyrian
[3:18:56] Sollice: Which I think I have 0 rep for lol
[3:18:58] GamerKillance: I have to admit the twitch chat was horrible on the reveal. So much hatred. It really shows how Blizzard promoted such disgsuting attitudes in WoW. I really hope they crack down hard like FF14 does on that attitude in-game
[3:19:01] Sollice: or reknown
[3:19:10] Ambersulfr: @Mitune  totally agree! a lot of the people who lose will be disappointed and sub anyway.
[3:19:53] Kisswani: @Ambevsulfr I think he meant 14 days for free to everyone
[3:20:35] Rankle19: Is the discord private I don’t see any channels
[3:20:51] Kisswani: you need to link your twitch to discord I think
[3:20:54] xjr216x: @gamerkillance that’s what happens when you lowball the community and makes promises you can’t keep
[3:21:03] Sollice: You need to follow instructions on the #Welcome channel
[3:21:10] SonofHorus82: I wonder if there will be any interviews for Wrath Classic. Would be nice to hear the reasoning behind removing LFD.
[3:21:41] Sarcastard: Sarcastard subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 60 months! gertz to winners
[3:21:52] Kisswani: @xjr216x the community attitude in the chat has nothing to do with blizzard . An asshole is an asshole regardless of the game they are playing . dont shift the blame from the community away
[3:22:41] Kisswani: that's liking to excuse the horrible people in chat by saying blizz deserve it anyway
[3:22:53] Kisswani: like saying *
[3:22:55] GamerKillance: No the community in WoW is ass. Been so for as long as I remember from 2005 when I first started. Blizzard doesn't ban people
[3:22:59] GamerKillance: They need to start doing that
[3:23:15] boopbopbamski: hot take every gaming community these days has toxic players... i know crazy take
[3:23:16] GamerKillance: The amount of death threats over pvp alone. Not to mention the n-word use thats rampant in WoW
[3:23:39] GamerKillance: Try saying that in FF14 or an MMO with moderators. You won't get far @boopbopbamski
[3:23:53] boopbopbamski: wow bans toxic ppl from chat all the time
[3:23:58] xjr216x: @kisswani couldn’t read what you said cause it was blocked off. Listen they’re just tired of seeing these guys promise one thing and leads to it not being real. We ban everyone then what. Next uo we’ll get ban for making a comment about the game that needs to be fixed
[3:24:01] GamerKillance: News to me
[3:24:02] mavericks312: @boopbopbamski i wouldnt say all i would say competitive or mmo's more then not
[3:24:04] boopbopbamski: you dont know what youre talking about
[3:24:22] boopbopbamski: correct @mavericks312  i am speaking more on popular multiplayer games
[3:24:25] Mitune: I think every mythic guild I have been in since it was release I have heard at least one anti-semtic person
[3:24:26] Heero_Effect: FF14 is toxic too
[3:24:32] Mitune: it sucks
[3:24:48] Kisswani: @xjr216x not an excuse for some of the behaviour we saw in chat . The attacks were personal , they weren't even about the game
[3:24:55] GamerKillance: Try being toxic in FF14 and show me you won't be banned. I'll gladly swallow what I said if you do
[3:25:07] Heero_Effect: Try saying you don’t like FF 14 and didn’t think it was good and see the fans attack you
[3:25:10] BlackCl0ud: ff14 has different kind of toxicity
[3:25:14] Mistery836: @xjr216x the "how far will they take it" excuse is so bad. holy KEKW you should know this
[3:25:20] boopbopbamski: FF players are sooo weird LUL
[3:25:36] MILESkg21: just the LALAFELS KEKW
[3:25:37] xjr216x: @kisswani those people are key board warriors. Nothing  better to do than insult someone
[3:25:42] jmalmin: If you dare say anything bad about FF14 in a chat where they worship the game.... Lets just say you get butchered :) You can also mention something good about wow and you get butchered too.
[3:25:53] GamerKillance: I play all MMO's and not just FF14. Its just FF14 took WoW crown as most played MMO recently so its used as an example
[3:26:01] AveragePvp: @jmalmin big facts
[3:26:02] GamerKillance: If it wasn't FF14 that was top then i'd be using the top
[3:26:03] BlackCl0ud: played through heavensward and very frequently i got people trying to convince me how good FF14 even though i didn't say anything
[3:26:08] boopbopbamski: why do FF players always have to try and show ppl MY GAME IS BETTER even when it comes to toxic ppl in the game and how the devs ban them LUL soo funny
[3:26:14] GamerKillance: Don't discredit someone just because they play a game you don't
[3:26:19] SonofHorus82: if you dont think the FF14 community is toxic try telling LITERALLY ANYONE that plays it that their game isnt the greatest and watch them LOSE IT.
[3:26:24] Heero_Effect: @jmalmin I have had people message me in twitch for that lol
[3:26:26] Warcsman: What is GT keys?
[3:26:28] AveragePvp: @gamerkillance HUH it did not take wows crown as the most played lmfao
[3:26:29] LarcenousLaugh: What’s the giveaway prize?
[3:26:33] AveragePvp: What are you even on about
[3:26:41] jasonbriggs: ff14 sux
[3:26:45] GamerKillance: Recent most played. Not overall
[3:26:46] AveragePvp: Wow still has substantially more players than ff14
[3:26:47] boopbopbamski: at this point u gotta think @GamerKillance  is trolling because if not ooffffff
[3:26:48] Kisswani: @xjr216x we agree on that . What I disagree with is saying that it is somehow justified because of game decisions
[3:26:49] Sollice: 14 days of WoW gametime provided by Blizzard
[3:26:51] Mistery836: @boopbopbamski people used to do that with WoW all the time. well. any community does tbh LUL
[3:26:55] DeanoTV: WoW > FF (now watch me get stabbed with a knife) LUL
[3:27:01] AveragePvp: @boopbopbamski he has to be trolling
[3:27:04] LarcenousLaugh: That’s an odd amount of time lol
[3:27:10] jacooners: after reading chat for about 3 mins..... full screen is the play
[3:27:21] Kisswani: @DeanoTV cohhStab
[3:27:22] jhopps12: Fornite > any other game, amiright? KEKW
[3:27:26] CardinalTX: The interwebs has bred a generation of drama andies.  Always has to be drama about something
[3:27:30] xjr216x: @kisswani not justifying just stating they’ll make another account will do the same thing. It’s not going to stop someone
[3:27:30] AveragePvp: @jacooners glad you typed that for us
[3:27:33] jmalmin: I do not mind what game people are playing. But being insulted for saying you like a feature in a game baffles me.
[3:27:38] rsimpson105: @jhopps12 are there even any other games besides fork knife? OMEGALUL
[3:27:49] Mistery836: @jhopps12 since the removal of building enormous towers/ hell ye! Kappa
[3:27:52] Heero_Effect: @deanotv -stabs in back 12 times-
[3:27:55] GamerKillance: I personally don't care what you think is best or worst. Subjective opinions are fine to have. That said moderation or lack of for WoW is objective. The community is quite toxic while Blizzard does little about it
[3:28:08] boopbopbamski: @GamerKillance  poongoWRONG poongoWRONG poongoWRONG
[3:28:13] Mattsta: yeah, I feel like 14 days were like standard giveaway like a decade ago...def feels odd seeing sub-30 day giveaways these day
[3:28:14] DeanoTV: @Kisswani put it down im sorry monkaS
[3:28:25] Kisswani: ok danHug
[3:28:30] xjr216x: @gamerkillance I mean.. yeah look how they handled the employees
[3:28:34] kashmara: <3 music
[3:28:54] ElDrakenMan: chat is there a link to towellies UI?
[3:28:54] Mistery836: wonder what zone the music is from Kappa
[3:28:54] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: overrated af
[3:28:57] Kisswani: Since they said Azure Pass was inspired by Grizzly hills , I wonder if the music is gonna be remeniscent of that as well
[3:28:58] sarbapowa: music <3
[3:29:04] Kisswani: !ui

[3:29:07] beanski10: so riots community is just as bad right since LoL is a cesspool
[3:29:10] jmalmin: Anyway WoW well actually Blizzard banns you really quickly if they notices that your toxic. So many people have been banned from Overwatch because of the way they use language.
[3:29:18] ElDrakenMan: @Kisswani thanks!
[3:29:22] AveragePvp: Blue Dragonflight gang!
[3:29:26] GamerKillance: If all the new employees get rid of the sludge that makes the comminity toxic then more power to them. As of now the toxic behavoir in WoW is hard to not see
[3:29:33] GamerKillance: Moreso to new tanks and healers. RIP them

[3:31:19] GamerKillance: @nokster Not being a trash human and expecting to be treated the same way is sensitive? Lol k
[3:31:25] Mistery836: @beanski10 yes. and Riot Games is just as responsible for their game's community in that sense.
[3:31:35] Kneckt: yes
[3:31:36] Kneckt: very good

[3:32:06] propwash80: anybody got a link to that article he just showed?
[3:32:10] Technogre: tldr : yep dragons
[3:32:12] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  there is a little bit from that interview on mrgm's twitter

[3:32:27] Sir_Cranium: My wife is finally getting into WoW now, and I'm gonna call it, she's gonna be one of the 60 day winners watch
[3:32:33] GamerKillance: Riot, Blizzard and Square are all responsible for their communities. The toxicity comes from their lack of punishment. It just happens FF14 has less of it. Yoshida didn't get best community director award at the game show for nothing
[3:32:33] Maydie6066: @Towelliee need to change scenes, its in presenter atm

[3:33:15] Texodar: oh snap, i won Pog
[3:33:19] Masqerader: Dragons, and hopefully Sargeras pulls out finally
[3:33:24] ijuki: @Critcobain Yes, it is amazing
[3:33:25] usse00: @Towelliee From where do you stream this wonderful WOW-theme music? And do you have a link to it?
[3:33:27] handlebarswow: yeah, they def need to change that
[3:33:29] YNR_Chewmiester: TL;Dr: "Thar be Dragons here"
[3:33:49] Dwarriortwo: Haven't played retail since before shadowlands, have you enjoyed it and what are your overall thoughts on the expansion
[3:33:54] Tokies: the augment rune should be a toy
[3:34:02] bob2305: most rep should be account wide
[3:34:05] Clicklesly: Yeah, i'm really not sure why they were talking how ZM is more alt friendly and then all we got was the intro skip...
[3:34:05] BlackCl0ud: 60 results of 60 hours
[3:34:12] instant_savage: makr it acciunt wide and gice shared inventory slots like gw2
[3:34:13] xjr216x: @towelliee that is the literal worst.
[3:34:20] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: wow has music on spotify now @towelliee
[3:34:34] Tokies: the toy would make it account bound and you wouldn't lose it in the mail so blizzard wouldn't have to worry about tracking it down for players.
[3:34:37] GamerKillance: Account bound rep and cross-faction pve should be the top of the list for the WoW team. Seriously there is no reason for it now other than laziness
[3:34:41] propwash80: @Towelliee what weakaura are you currently using for you pally?
[3:34:47] mavericks312: and they throw free 252 gear at you
[3:34:50] handlebarswow: like, the memory is account bound at revered but not the rune? doesn't make sense
[3:34:50] darssia_: boa gear too. but like, that's it.
[3:34:53] handlebarswow: all should be
[3:34:54] Hitokiri83: i make alot of my gold on the AH from the augment runes
[3:34:58] fistofnature: could you make the screen bigger? its hard to see what youo are doing
[3:35:14] fistofnature: its kinda zoomed out
[3:35:15] MILESkg21: !scene
[3:35:28] BlackCl0ud: if we get all endgame systems as account-wide, imma be happy next expansion
[3:35:42] Ertra: can you change your scene back?
[3:35:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Making you do the grinds over again on alts is annoying, yeah
[3:35:54] GamerKillance: Faction imbalance is the biggest issue. Factions just don't work anymore
[3:35:55] CardinalTX: would be a huge win
[3:35:56] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @fistofnature no :)
[3:36:07] fistofnature: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight FeelsBadMan
[3:36:09] pereadin: ah shit
[3:36:12] pereadin: he's azralon
[3:36:21] Ertra: they do a ton of dmg lol
[3:36:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Warlocks are pumpers right now
[3:36:26] amricatt: So many warlocks and hunters needing love.
[3:36:27] dimofodi: Lol, of course, they do deeps
[3:36:27] pereadin: healthstones and damage
[3:36:29] propoopimus: well they are broken, so yea
[3:36:31] BlackCl0ud: i mean, they should start rolling account-wide stuff from now in SL
[3:36:33] CritcobainTV: monkaS
[3:36:41] BlackCl0ud: would be cool
[3:36:41] AlphasaurusRexx: @GamerKillance they work without passives. some passives are just far more useful than others
[3:36:56] laggkillz: I think having completed a covenent on a toon, should open it up completely to alts that join that covenent with max research / completion @Towelliee
[3:36:58] AlphasaurusRexx: @GamerKillance racials & passives
[3:36:58] MILESkg21: 9.2.5 would be great
[3:37:07] BlackCl0ud: like start with something small for starters at the moment. get real feedback also
[3:37:13] Mistery836: Please make everything except for gear account wide 🙏
[3:37:14] peinen: @Towelliee word of the expansion.. accessiability!
[3:37:15] dimofodi: All currencies and all rep bare minimum should be account wide
[3:37:22] GamerKillance: @AlphasaurusRexx Which is why removing factions for pve should just happen. No more stupid faction war that hardly exist in WoW anymore
[3:37:24] ContraRob: something as simple as gold being account wide will feel so good
[3:37:32] GamerKillance: I mean its literally go horde or don't do stuff
[3:37:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, account-wide is a quality of life pain-point issue....if they want to make it more fun, make it less painful to be on an alt
[3:37:37] Khade_Tyrson: no borrowed power FOR NOW
[3:37:40] BlackCl0ud: i mean gold you can trade from character to character
[3:37:43] MrFuzzynuts420: I’m with Asmongold. Account wide everything. Stop with all the bullshit
[3:37:53] Nerendis: HickoryLIVE subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:38:08] Mistery836: @GamerKillance + I just want to play any race I want without worrying about wether or not I can play with friends LUL
[3:38:13] AlphasaurusRexx: @GamerKillance yeah i was for cross faction in legion. we were basically on the same side for that expansion
[3:38:20] Nerendis: Only taken like 4 years to hit 15 months
[3:38:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Right now I would use my alts more if I didn't have to blow a bunch of gold on legendary blanks for them.,..it's painful
[3:38:24] GamerKillance: Well the mass migration of players that moved away from players caused WoW team to listen. We'll see if they truly listen next expac
[3:38:48] GamerKillance: My brain farted. Moved away from the game*

[3:39:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: 3K IO is badass
[3:40:19] GamerKillance: Another i'd recommend is making keys only done through guilds. Like seriously pugging keys creates all sort of drama. Even in keys below 5 lol
[3:40:39] GamerKillance: They keep making M+ harder too since Legion

[3:41:21] Mistery836: the dps on prot paladin is p nutty monkaS
[3:42:03] Mistery836: also wow what, survival hunter on top of dps chart?! is it because there is no target limit?
[3:42:20] GamerKillance: Prot pallies have always been nutty. Nothing beat prot warriors during Seige of Orgrimmar. My goodness the guild I ran with heroic garrosh the main tank pulled like 1m dmg. It was insane
[3:42:25] dcmvt: Do you have a tip for a all new prot pally in M+? Kinda scared because I know no routes yade yada
[3:42:25] ImCancakes: i'm really looking forward to the UI updates. hopefully it's implemented well enough to where i can uninstall some addons
[3:42:28] DarkMatterMVP: Have the account wide rep question been raised in any of the interviews?
[3:42:39] Heero_Effect: HSCheers
[3:42:54] peinen: have to talent into it
[3:43:46] AlphasaurusRexx: @dcmvt research is your friend. take the time to plan out your own route or research the fastest route and learn to pull it off
[3:44:02] pringlez91: Looks like WoW Dragonflight is looking to be king of MMO in 2023
[3:44:12] Sarcastard: yeah
[3:44:32] GamerKillance: @pringlez91 People say that every expansion. Just like how people say WoW will die every expansion
[3:44:55] ArcaneSyntax: range actually killing the orbs? in m+? Is it my birthday?
[3:45:00] Mistery836: @dcmvt just start from the beginning tbh. I doubt you will start off with +15s from the start right? everyone will make mistakes. you'l grow as you go :)
[3:45:03] ImCancakes: i know we haven't heard really anything about Riot's MMO, but I wonder how their development is going and if itll line up at all with DF xpac
[3:45:28] dannyis1337: still waiting for guild wars 2 on steam lol
[3:45:43] pringlez91: that will be a good addition
[3:46:10] DeanoTV: Just saw Tera is closing wow
[3:46:13] GamerKillance: I like the honesty Riot said with their MMO production. Outright said that the community could be toxic enough to where their entire community could be banned. They were so hesitent to say that to where they're skeptical on the MMO in general
[3:46:21] GamerKillance: Have you guys see their recent interview on it?
[3:46:23] spainard15: Think Riot just said they are not going to release their MMO if they feel it will be bad

[3:46:56] GoodGuyHeliioz: !yt
[3:47:04] Mistery836: Riot Games is sitting on so much money they can affort to just not release a game if it's bad too LUL
[3:47:22] GamerKillance: But again GhostCrawler is in charge of the direction right? He did MoP well enough so I think it could turn out well

[4:19:22] AveragePvp: @zeitgeiz dope
[4:19:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: If it's mostly picking between single target and AOE, it could be fine
[4:19:43] Blackmarsh: New talent system is gonna have a cookie cutter build anyway, so it wont matter at all sadly
[4:19:43] jerkass: Did any interviewer ask the question re: not testing future/new raid bosses like they did for Sepulcher last 3
[4:19:53] SonofHorus82: super happy that drakthyr are locked to only evokers and no tanks. that'll keep at least some variety in dungeons for that first month or so.
[4:19:56] Malarick: please dont tease me with Shockadin
[4:20:21] gregl__: i mean it went well
[4:20:21] Blackmarsh: I like how FF does it, no PTR on raids
[4:20:39] zeitgeiz: I’m okay with it having a cookie cutter build, but there is gonna be so many options with load outs. Like legion had cookie cutter for my lock, but I could still play around with a lot of talents on fights
[4:21:00] mavericks312: just let the halondrus guy make the whole raid would be in good shape
[4:21:15] zeitgeiz: Even the illusion of choice is better than the current talents where you know 100% there is no choice
[4:21:37] laito_: Something they didnt talk about was the baseline abilities, are we getting some new buttons or nothing at all for all classes
[4:21:47] MILESkg21: there will always be a meta no matter what 4Head

[4:30:57] magiccanvashands: After the Wrath of the Lich King classic announcement everyone stopped watching the new Expac announcement. The real reason for having the announcement was to give the people what they wanted.... Wrath classic... so many reaction videos I watched cut away after the wrath announcement lol

[4:39:21] YSGMarquise: mrbmarquisehd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:39:30] Flawl3ssVic: Imo the token helped destroy the game
[4:39:35] MILESkg21: yeah wtf will be the first allied race ??
[4:40:06] Flawl3ssVic: You can pay real cash for anything now defeating the sense of progression
[4:40:15] theDirtyon3: didnt they say no more allied races?
[4:40:21] theDirtyon3: that was a BfA thing
[4:40:36] propoopimus: murlocs
[4:40:43] Coriollis: I think they care thou, like a guy who would sub for 6 months , subs for 1 month and gets token boosted from the price of 5 month token idk maybe I don't view it properly
[4:40:46] Taylormade2711: @scarletbeard people already paid real money for gold before the token
[4:40:55] SALVATii0N: Thought it was something else other than the dragons lol my bad
[4:40:59] creamdrood: It only defeats the sense of progression if you actually do pay real money, just do it youself and you still have a sense of progression.
[4:41:52] Flawl3ssVic: Yea, gold farmers existed before but it wasn’t main stream or encouraged. Only certain subsets would pay for good and it was discouraged.
[4:42:24] MILESkg21: i paid for gold back in cata and it was stupid KEKW

[4:45:04] abhmonk: luxthos WA's, a man of culture I see
[4:45:05] abhmonk: :D
[4:45:09] Flawl3ssVic: It was a move to make more money by Blizzard at the cost of the game. They won’t remove it. If they did, more players would come back, but they clearly believe they make more money than getting more players.
[4:45:12] abhmonk: love them
[4:45:28] Maydie6066: @ScarletBeard doubt.jpg
[4:45:37] Harrymason18: @HD_MOVIE_SOURCE These are meant to make things harder, not easier
[4:46:08] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: @Harrymason18 yeah but it would make it more fun.
[4:46:21] Flawl3ssVic: Say what you want but player numbers decreased when they added it. Micro transactions ruin the game.
[4:46:23] kevo_k: @Harrymason18 the point would be more fun as well though
[4:46:33] ninedraft317: Do you think we will know the release date before November?

[4:47:40] PvtHudson093: Field of dreams?
[4:48:21] MrGrimms: tim robbins
[4:48:46] Maydie6066: @ScarletBeard numbers have decreased for so many reasons it would take an essay to list it all. WoW tokens are not micro transactions. removing them from the game would do nothing for the overall sub count, but would drive desperate people back into black market gold

[4:49:52] abhmonk: you can pull everything but the matriach as long as you kill hatcling fast
[4:49:54] Flawl3ssVic: Going to respectfully disagree. Why do you think people left TBC classic after they introduced boosts?
[4:50:03] mmrghost7: this guy is a tank eater

[4:50:15] abhmonk: oh for sure
[4:50:37] theDirtyon3: @ScarletBeard thinking its only because of boosts and stuff is kinda narrow sighted

[4:51:59] dimofodi: Just know whatever it is we see, it will blend in with the surrounding areas.
[4:51:59] RageerPLZ: Would you prefer 8 dungeons from Dragonflight expo, then Season 2 to be 4 from Dragonflight and 4 from old world?
[4:52:13] Atro_TV: delete necrotic
[4:52:16] RocketMan23: they would get rid of tyran/fort before seasonals
[4:52:19] jpwastaken_: get rid of explosive please

[4:52:22] spokysnoky: Fuck necrotic
[4:52:23] j_bar111: Dragon born each boss has a frontal and tailswipe @Towelliee
[4:52:41] darssia_: if they change the dungeons every season they don't need the seasonal affix no?
[4:52:53] theDirtyon3: Max had a really good take on that as well yesterday when he was talking about m+ with yumi growl and jpc
[4:52:59] Elenagjika: Cant wait for gates of the seting sun m+
[4:53:06] dyslexican1: They wont. i hope there are some bigj changes to afixes, cus this x-pacs are miserable, but there is no shot they are getting rid of seasons. I think they said the opposite didnt they?
[4:53:14] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: I want to see all new dungeons I don't want to play old dungeons in a new expansion @Towelliee
[4:53:50] YungDizzY: he hit 3k yet?
[4:54:01] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: season 2 fine, not season 2
[4:54:11] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: 1
[4:54:20] Maydie6066: @ScarletBeard 1) there was a 1 time boost for TBC, and it was to draw players in that didn't go though classic, its not a re-occuring boost option. 2) it was offered before TBC even released so it can't have driven people away from it. 3) boosts =/= wow token, classic has and will always have a larger spike in numbers as people play it in spurts, but on top of that it has no relevance to retail, which is where the token is located and the point of this discussion. the wow token is not even top 1

[5:27:11] croppeast: might not have the vocabulary to swap out "like"
[5:27:11] Sollice: Chat- Kyrian or Night Fae for Arms Warrior? Would I guess rather be NF since I have already done the story on the other characters if its not that much of a difference
[5:27:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: like i like it
[5:27:22] TialePetit: @Clicklesly most likely.. that's how majority of interviews go
[5:27:28] Aquadriel: @Towelliee is the same art style
[5:27:31] Kisswani: not really , the colors stand out
[5:27:35] Molvonos: @Sollice Night Fae.  Rock your wood armor set and glowy purple particles.
[5:27:53] Sollice: Thank you Molv. I have done ZERO of Kyrian shit
[5:28:00] Sollice: This warrior has a lot to do lol
[5:28:00] pereadin: Don't forget chat, we are looking for a +20 Spries of Ascension if anyone has one
[5:28:01] Demanisraar: That priest one though
[5:28:03] chrslp: The more 'likes' I see in a sentence, the more I read it as someone super unsure of what theyre saying LUL
[5:28:44] wreckshoptv: can she stop saying like xD

[5:29:03] Sollice: Is red the ONLY one that doesnt have issues?
[5:29:07] DeanoTV: shot every time like is said
[5:29:12] TialePetit: It's amazing how the tendancy of saying "like" is a normal thing in spoken language.
[5:29:15] Theliahh: @Sollice pretty much
[5:29:16] darssia_: omg can we stop saying like lmao.
[5:29:16] chrslp: You know who says like a lot? A 10 year old coming up with an excuse or story LUL
[5:29:19] Praetour: Bronze don't... yet... Kappa
[5:29:31] Urebaldd: More likes inc

[5:31:28] Praetour: Like hell yeah brother, I like, like it
[5:31:33] theDirtyon3: the BEST options
[5:31:37] chrslp: @Theliahh I mean I know it generally shows someone is unsure of what theyre saying and is a type of mental reset to get back on track.. Still, every 10 year old I used to babysit used it coming up with excuses or stories LUL
[5:31:57] Kisswani: give us a " summon whelps " ability you cowards danRage

[5:37:45] theDirtyon3: WICKED
[5:37:47] Velashen: Yeah no one is going to enjoy old flying after this.
[5:37:51] Ezekyler: goose FeelsBadMan
[5:37:52] wreckshoptv: i hope they add race flying
[5:37:56] Kisswani: @DeanoTV I started playing just before Wrath prepatch , which is when meta was introduced . it's one of my most cherished memories
[5:37:58] GT_JamesATL: I hear the dragon flight is just using Guild Wars 2 flying mechanics?
[5:38:07] schneid4: nah still need my solar spire hawk

[5:41:34] Krue_Sr: "If we were to do it" *wink wink*
[5:41:35] KarazhanTV: I think with the engine that wow have its so hard to make player housing .
[5:41:36] darssia_: "costs you a raid tier"
[5:41:36] RageerPLZ: pretty sweet
[5:41:38] Praetour: Can't wait for someone to just say "We'll let you know we're doing housing when we're ready stop asking"
[5:41:39] Folgrum: housing confirmed in 11 oe 12
[5:41:59] Shirey36: why do ppl want housing so bad

[5:46:50] Kisswani: which is a shame , Dragon Isles seem like a perfect place for Arch
[5:46:53] Kisswani: yeah
[5:46:59] Sollice: @Towelliee It's a dumb decision considering how the story is going to unfold
[5:47:05] Demanisraar: Stop, just leave it in the grave it is in
[5:47:05] pereadin: I've been working on my Archeology just in case it makes the well deserved return

[5:47:57] dutchie76: Archaeology needs some work, the developers aren't happy with how it played out or ended up. Although collecting artifacts and exploring history is thematic to exploring the Dragon Isles, the excavation mini-game of Archaeology is not currently planned to return. They'd like to figure out something better to do with it in the future.

[6:02:04] brewsuadeshoes: I think 8 would be healthy
[6:02:08] swordart2022: cause someone might paly too much or what ??

[6:03:25] swordart2022: I AM ACTUALLY cant paly so remove bosses to fit it my views YEP .. I actually dont want 8 new dungeson so just give 4 new YEP .. Logic is this ..

[6:04:00] daegoh: It obvious wow caters to the higher end. They dont care about casual players.
