[0:12:12] Ripper10: the goat exp
[0:12:29] Ripper10: ah
[0:12:30] thicchornx: yeah I feel like the main reason to even do cata is bc they wanted to get to do mop
[0:12:39] thicchornx: bc they originally said wotlk would be the last classic xpac
[0:12:43] OGRaGeR_TV: unfollowed
[0:12:50] ekunx: wtf???
[0:12:54] saund: i just want to pvp without having to pve

[0:15:07] thicchornx: wotlk was hyped as the savior to reunite all wow playerbases bc pve and pvp was insane and even the retailers would come.  10k queues to log in during the first 2 weeks D:
[0:15:16] michael_jordan_cleave: Second season of cata arena will be like wotlk arena now, dead. Cata isn't a popular pserver expansion for a reason

[0:47:35] saund: Will you bother raiding in cata If gdkp is still the meta?
[0:47:36] reggieface420: because of the way rested works i would assume 80-85 is quite short
[0:47:59] reggieface420: u get 1.5 levels before u start on an alt
[0:48:24] kaptenapa: 84 to 85 is quite time consuming compared to the other 4 lvls
[0:48:44] Ripper10: which phase is this staff
[0:48:50] reggieface420: p2
[0:49:00] KDK_here: busted KEKW

[0:50:11] jamminlove: (idk)
[0:50:15] mattbradz: Is there any big pve gear or trinkets in first season or two?
[0:50:26] Ashleylol: @jamminlove Weirdge

[0:50:51] Ashleylol: u cant just use my catchphrases jammin...
[0:51:00] jamminlove: Ur here so Im allowed to
[0:51:04] reggieface420: i stayed up from 70 to 80, didnt sleep, if cata is only 7 hrs 80-85  it will be the easiest leveling yet by far
[0:51:07] raselsuggy: why would it be good having no gdkps in cata
[0:51:34] raselsuggy: i like having to grind to get some items
[0:51:35] dsaucemaster: dude why so negative Kappa
[0:51:46] souljuhwitch: i gdkp and never bought gold, i kind of have to cause my work schedule
[0:51:47] raselsuggy: imagine u have to join a guild or sr run
[0:51:50] KDK_here: but you buy it with gold 4Head
[0:51:52] raselsuggy: and u lose every item
[0:51:59] spaghettijones8: Cata gonna be hype for 2 weeks then dead like wotlk gg
[0:52:01] Urpalmax: pojke what is your soloq rating on whitemane??
[0:52:11] reggieface420: the sod gdkp ban doesn't seem particularly effective, it came with a giant population drop
[0:52:23] raselsuggy: also alot of people cant just join a guild, get their bis items then leave untill next tier
[0:52:29] thicchornx: i agree but its also the only way some of us can get pve gear!! but i guess that wont matter in cata anyways?
[0:52:38] jamminlove: It will mean that everyone doing  boosts for gold will start RMT
[0:52:38] mopdruidx: XD
[0:52:39] raselsuggy: most people have to stick to their raiding guild throughout the whole phase
[0:52:48] bralelol: how many boosts u guys sold for real money...
[0:52:48] reggieface420: they do
[0:52:56] Xeriyo: my friends had warnings first

[0:56:41] reggieface420: i am in a dirt cheap guild gdkp, nothing we have sells for anything, its like the opposite experience

[1:03:30] Xeriyo: wasnt that cata? or was that early wotlk actually
[1:03:33] GarrinchA: @reggieface420 not blood plague, but plague strike i think
[1:03:35] Xeriyo: i remember this tho ye
[1:03:43] GarrinchA: s5 dks removed hots with plague strike
[1:04:03] demongodxtv: the meta origional s5 was dk and survival hunter

[1:24:32] juicedog7: wrath shoulda had more tournaments like they did in tbc would revive the game
[1:24:39] juicedog7: atlesat on na servers
[1:24:53] juicedog7: im highest hpal on na and its ass i just got an add so wait
[1:24:56] mikecoxhuge1: problem is its so hard to get new players into wow,

[1:25:19] GarrinchA: im sad i couldnt play s8 :(
[1:25:20] jerrysp: Does anyone remember if cata has the chance for the spells to be resisted ?
[1:25:21] Taroo5: Didnt wrath have 2 aswell?
[1:25:22] infrex1: soloq in cata would be amazing, had a nice time in Whitemane
[1:25:29] Taroo5: Oddwaffle won one and you won one right?
[1:25:41] mikecoxhuge1: yep
[1:25:42] Waybetterr: What u think about wotlk tourny,i mean at end of expansion like on retail?

[1:26:15] notmorbos: @glycinexz solo q is super new in dragonflight and theres no reason to believe theyll put it in anytime soon
[1:26:23] notmorbos: just some people hoping for it
[1:26:48] infrex1: yea no way it's happening
[1:26:52] Aspmann: They actually commented on solo q in cata as well. Said there are no plans for it but they'll "listen" to what the community says
[1:26:56] infrex1: but it's hella fun nontheless
[1:27:08] dsaucemaster: alot of people quit wrath because first 2 seasons they were stuck in dead servers. Only players in mega servers were enjoying the game
[1:28:06] GarrinchA: im sorry for those guys, imagine trying ur best to climb and just facing best players playing best comp, 600 rating above
[1:28:18] spliffz123: wotlk also had extremely Long queues on firemaw and gehennas i remember 10 hour queues
[1:28:23] Twhitch: @GarrinchA fun fact they lose 0 mmr and will only gain experience
[1:28:27] infrex1: that answer smells like "we gonna add it season 3"
[1:28:27] Boikyn: Hi
[1:28:34] pvelordtv: hard need soloq
[1:28:45] glycinexz: would make also sense to be able to start the match earlier than 1 minute, of both teams ready, buffed and stuff
[1:28:53] glycinexz: if*
[1:28:57] notmorbos: @GarrinchA yea i also queue into pojke even though i never win. its just good practice and you lose almost nothing
[1:29:05] juicedog7: did u answer me
[1:29:30] glycinexz: @notmorbos I actually get a bit nervous when q into famous good players, and I think it makes me play worse
[1:29:46] unexpectedLoL: if cata would get solo shuffle/queue would be so insane
[1:29:52] Aspmann: Thing is there is literally nothing to learn as disc dk vs war pal though LUL you lose every game and lose even more on ruins
[1:30:03] notmorbos: appreciate that, thanks

[1:30:54] glycinexz: Mr Pojke, do you think removing r1 rank for 2s is a good idea?
[1:31:06] Twhitch: thats why you should apply to work as the official pvp officer at bliizz

[3:00:09] hunni_milk: Do I come back for Cata? I feel like I have an abusive relationship with WoW
[3:01:01] hunni_milk: But she takes all my serotonin in the divorce
[3:01:17] datEnigma: @hunni_milk :D
[3:02:32] hunni_milk: Guys did Cata introduce the "For the people" thing?
[3:02:49] GarrinchA: what were the most popular comps for 2s and 3s in cata ?
[3:03:23] shozgodx: cant wait to see a million RLS teams
[3:03:33] hunni_milk: @GarrinchA I remember jungle being very strong, and WMP being really strong with the PVE weapons + trinkets
[3:03:37] datEnigma: even chan was somewhat hyped for cata, saying its his favourite xpac personally
[3:03:47] ktp_blue: yea well chan is special
[3:04:07] hunni_milk: For the people was the thing where when you reach a time limit one team just gets like 200% increased damage
[3:04:08] GarrinchA: all 3 shaman specs were op right ?
[3:04:10] hunni_milk: till the match ends

[3:05:06] datEnigma: my biggest question tbh is, is hpala dog in cata or not, theres so little info on web
[3:05:15] GarrinchA: @skruapasta1996 so it was mage rogue again being broken ?
[3:05:43] notmorbos: any information from original cata will be useless anyway
[3:05:44] datEnigma: kk, I just heard everyone saying rsham is hpala of wrath in cata
[3:05:58] amethyst023: its just gonna be exactly the same like tbc and wrath people will enjoy it in the beginning then will hate the expansion

[6:44:17] cepsegnever: @kenniflopper kinda cringe to remove titles from 2s tho, u force ppl to play a bracket they mby dont enjoy, it hurts u that ppl gets them in 2s? who cares let ppl enjoy what they like
[6:44:28] Ezzx: @kooolzin think its the other way around, way to little ppl to play with, just more of a hustle to set up 3s compared to 2s
[6:44:35] reggieface420: im shocked that arenas in classic give nothing, no honor or shit, its like 10 games and done simulator half the players
[6:44:39] Taroo5: me and my friends 100% quit because it is too dreadful to get pve gear in wrath

[6:44:44] prodijftw0: @Minpojke

[6:45:00] Badly216: if arena gave honor or something thatd be cool
[6:45:06] kooolzin: @cepsegnever i care because 2s titles makes 3s dead

[6:45:31] hvmantv: Cata had issues, which they will never fix, and with the playerbase for cata classic being split between retail and sod, it will die fast sadly
[6:45:36] Badly216: that makes it valuable for bots
[6:45:41] Layr: @Tupacx if 2s didnt give titles it would enforce ppl to play 3s more which is alot better bracket
[6:45:50] vbx93: wel then the bots can kick current bots Kappa
[6:45:51] vbx93: nah jk
[6:45:53] Tupacx: Ye but nobody wants to be enforced to do anything

[6:46:13] kooolzin: titles in 2s force ppl to q 2s aswell because nobody qs 3s
[6:46:17] MisterChow: 2s is fun for a lot of people and then it turns into a meme without titles
[6:46:21] cepsegnever: @kooolzin you can make 3s alive without remove titles in 2s, easily, but they dont care about pvp in general so ppl plays what they can, 2s is way more accesible u require less players to play with
[6:46:23] kenniflopper: @Tupacx why do every non hpal war think wrath is piss rn
[6:46:30] kenniflopper: 3s is dead, 2s is perma hpal war
[6:46:31] Ezzx: @Tupacx this, rather just dump this game then lmao, abandoned classic xpacs with super low population, then forced to schedule 3´s with even more people compared to 2s
[6:46:32] kenniflopper: surely thats fun
[6:46:33] Badly216: yeah
[6:46:44] Badly216: 2s died for me super fast in wrath when i fought the exact same comps over n over lol
[6:46:50] Badly216: Disc feral or war hpal
[6:46:53] Badly216: KEKW

[6:47:06] kooolzin: 2s is piss
[6:47:23] MisterChow: what if they made tbc era? would people play
[6:47:25] vbx93: bakka kinda sounds like shinta no? or is it just basic french Kappa
[6:47:51] Badly216: i think the tbc hype is over
[6:47:57] Badly216: everyone got their enjoyment from tbc classic
[6:47:59] cepsegnever: @kenniflopper ye og wow had some things rly wrong, one was removing 2s titles and forcing everyone to do 3s if they wanted them, same happens with not giving soloq 1v1 2v2, all goes around forcing the playerbase to do 3s
[6:48:01] Badly216: arena started to die at the end
[6:48:04] ekunx: show of faith'
[6:48:05] techn0000: tbc would be dead now as well
[6:48:10] techn0000: cant have 4 different versions
[6:48:14] MisterChow: i think cata is DOA
[6:48:25] Ezzx: @techn0000 this prolly the biggest reason
[6:48:29] vbx93: @Badly216 Azie was streaming against Berry/Inquis yday on some pserver
[6:48:39] MisterChow: we might as well all go suffer in soloshuffles
[6:48:43] vbx93: astonished he had like 200 viewers
[6:48:45] Badly216: yeah i seen
[6:48:52] Badly216: theres always a small crowd that loves it
[6:48:56] ekunx: tbc would've been insanely active if there were no arena teams and if it would be a little easier to get offpieces
[6:48:58] GarrinchA: SOD tbc!
[6:49:03] reggieface420: tbc classic classic of discovery
[6:49:07] matgr1993: TBC era would have only a bunch of extreme veterans like you, without the "Casual" presence, the game just dies
[6:49:08] hvmantv: Tbc will die as fast as cata in a re-do (change my mind)
[6:49:22] Ilidarilolz: cata >>>> wotlk deal with it
[6:49:22] MisterChow: ya we dont want wotlk, if u sod tbc its just wotlk
[6:49:25] reggieface420: sod is already sod wotlk
[6:49:26] satsinaksa: Thats what classic players said about classic sod
[6:49:27] yamzxc: sod is already just wotlk in vanilla, sod tbc would just be wotlk
[6:49:30] vbx93: sod already is to crazy
[6:49:31] cepsegnever: just burn out sod, whoever thought was a good idea to retailizing vanilla... my eyes
[6:49:32] satsinaksa: Kappa
[6:49:35] dsaucemaster: wrath arena with 264 ilevel in arena only is prime.
[6:49:51] MisterChow: i agree
[6:49:54] matgr1993: If TBC had Dual talent spec, i might've never quited
[6:49:56] MisterChow: 1 pvp 1 pve
[6:49:58] Badly216: wrath would probably be dead haha
[6:50:05] reggieface420: wrath arena with 284 mainset pieces and 277 honor gear PogChamp
[6:50:07] nikzyyy: id want a tbc server like that
[6:50:10] mattbradz: 100% would play tbc
[6:50:11] kooolzin: wrath would be all the warpal players killing each other
[6:50:12] kooolzin: KEKW
[6:50:28] Badly216: Dual spec in tbc would of went crazy forsure
[6:50:32] Ninemmglock: im playing tauren resist warrior if tbc goes alive again.

[6:50:42] Yormanqt: payo also was saying he want tbc again
[6:50:45] Tupacx: @kenniflopper I dont think it's all about comps, big factor is also the pve aspect, people dont like to feel forced to doing pve, as much as I dont think anyone would like to feel forced to do 3s
[6:50:53] reggieface420: wow players just want whatever they currently don't have i think
[6:50:58] reggieface420: right now its cata
[6:51:01] vbx93: ^
[6:51:04] vbx93: 100%
[6:51:15] kenniflopper: @Tupacx yet wrath is still good, u need 12 pieces of pve in that expansion, nowhere near as much as in cata
[6:51:23] samstah: spot on @reggieface420
[6:51:27] kenniflopper: its just burnout so wrath is dead now imo
[6:51:28] MisterChow: i think people would play tbc
[6:51:33] pancake_mike: TBC Kreygasm
[6:51:39] cepsegnever: @Tupacx exactly this^
[6:51:39] bamboonas: We just need mop
[6:51:40] reggieface420: remember when in early tbc they made a new vanilla server, SoM, and no one played it
[6:51:44] MisterChow: tbc is so casual friendly unlike wrath
[6:51:46] Badly216: i think having the option to jump around would def be amazing
[6:51:47] nichoxtv: WRATH IS FOREVER THE BEST
[6:51:55] Badly216: imagine being able to swap between tbc wrath and cata w/e u wanted
[6:51:59] matgr1993: I think classic shouldn't go to Cata, it should go back to vanila and just circle Vanila-tbc-wrath ( just add dual talent spec to all)
[6:52:00] moonsculptortwo: Hi. As for me, i want to go through Cata, Panda and then stop forever.
[6:52:04] Taroo5: would you play it over cata?
[6:52:07] Badly216: "lets go que games on tbc cause cata's not popping rn"
[6:52:11] mopdruidx: disable every version of wow and keep mop forever and everyones happy
[6:52:18] reggieface420: we are getting cata so we are very likely to get mop
[6:52:28] techn0000: @MisterChow tbc engaged all the pve casuals with bis weapons at 1800 rating
[6:52:35] reggieface420: progressive patch tbc absolutely sucks
[6:52:39] MisterChow: ya its awesome
[6:52:40] reggieface420: its really bad
