[1:17:41] SamuraiWillZ916: frostmourne hungers
[1:17:51] mavericks312: method is still 2-3 days behind 1 and 2

[1:22:13] Sollice: Would be a good time to do it if you have been contemplating it. This expansion has been generally well received and I think the raids have been pretty good. I would think if you wanted to do it, you would feel good doing it this expansion

[1:24:28] futomara01: windingo ate my baby
[1:24:29] fawnylove1829: Good morning all
[1:24:31] Puppette: Max said they had flights scheduled for the day after they killed it and raiding would be paused as people traveled home
[1:24:47] king_julian_96: how's lock tankign been so far toweliee
[1:25:10] ambiotic: because the echo channel is the main draw versus liquid being max
[1:25:12] mavericks312: you didnt like the goth room lol
[1:25:25] abracka_: they're trying to attract gen z to wow
[1:26:00] Nevindaz: they ned MrGm back
[1:26:01] mavericks312: i liked methods more then liquuids tbh
[1:26:04] Dalinaar: boi
[1:26:05] Nevindaz: LUL
[1:26:35] ambiotic: thats what i was waiting on, going to level its not so so packed
[1:26:50] Nevindaz: they have the best cast ngl
[1:26:54] abracka_: their main channel gets so many fucking viewers compared to the individual streamers in the guild
[1:27:01] abracka_: complete polar opposite for liquid
[1:27:04] king_julian_96: be itneresting to see how logn the first raid of the war within goes for the race to world first be itnerestign to see how long that race goes for
[1:27:06] CardinalTX: Ive never been interested in the race, but then i havent raided raided since og wotlk
[1:27:57] ambiotic: Thats because they have conditioned their viewers to watch the main channel. I think that was the smart move
[1:28:02] abracka_: he was about to break someone's neck towards the end of his PC bricking KEKW
[1:28:30] surpriseparty20: Does EU have a bigger raiding pop and this transition to viewership?
[1:28:36] Nevindaz: Liquid should invite Shroud as a caster KEKW
[1:28:47] Nevindaz: easy 100k viewers

[1:30:39] Nevindaz: they should hire an audio tech first.. the quality of the audio is so low
[1:30:43] CardinalTX: I wonder if they have plans to change MC al all for SoD
[1:30:46] Nevindaz: dk.. what mics they use
[1:30:48] Wulfgrym: that was me yesterday needed 1 quest item out of 7, had to kill another 15 mobs to get it
[1:32:02] Sollice: Hasn't Max said before that he gives a cut of his stream to his raiders? I could be way off on that
[1:32:17] mavericks312: also its not like max actually talkst o chat that much during the race
[1:32:23] Tiamarilien: Max once said, that he splits the take from his channel during race with his raiders. Was a few races ago. Liquid might take it now
[1:32:35] Dox023: @sollice I remember him saying that too.
[1:33:14] abracka_: paying people salary? the fuck you think this is KEKW
[1:34:59] Sollice: Has anyone in chat leveled inscription past 62?

[2:33:34] chalupabatman513: what did you do for work before streaming?
[2:33:45] thelifebinder: i think they partially do it because of yearly financial planning - sucks big time tho..
[2:34:01] JoshuaTree6969: Before the h9olidays is the worst bc no one is hiring you until after the new year, been there done that brother. good luck to you
[2:34:33] CardinalTX: Grocery retail can suck at times but we never lay off. People always gotta eat

[2:37:10] Colt_Engineer: sorry not nor, just korea
[2:37:13] Rakim88: twitch did have a HQ but it was the country that did it really. the cost for twitch was too insane.
[2:37:18] MoonwalkingAngel: you heard about korea twitch
[2:37:24] geokouts: 2 more HC dungeons for my 3 vault 441 items
[2:37:41] Sollice: Kick wont be able to stream either
[2:37:43] notdustinx: Dang...
[2:37:46] Sollice: Kick uses AWS
[2:37:50] mavericks312: didnt netflix pull out of korea too?
[2:37:52] Colt_Engineer: it's be intersting to see the economic impact in a few years of korean streamers leaving the country
[2:37:55] Rakim88: kick might not be willing to host them either cause the cost will be insane for their AWS servers n gambling is illegal in korea
[2:37:57] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[2:37:57] Sharkeys: KEKW if the amount twitch have to pay to operate. there is no way kick will do it
[2:38:02] DunzoCD: just an unfortunate situation
[2:38:11] maalow: twitch is not a big thing in korea
[2:38:13] tuvotastic: Yea the CEO said it cost them 10x more to host services in Korea than anywhere else
[2:38:34] maalow: there's other services
[2:38:36] LadineL337: Are we allowing alts in the guild yet ?
[2:38:37] Nekkromonger: Kanima is a great LA streamer too.
[2:38:50] geokouts: kick has a HEAVY money partner so they will be around for a while without making profit
[2:39:04] Rakim88: they have their own verison of twitch but it pays bad n is korean only which alot of those streamers do english sreams. afeeca tv w/e it is
[2:39:05] Sollice: There are local Korean stearming sites. One of them got a %17 boost in their stock on the announcement
[2:39:12] Greviev: apparently all this might be related to Naver releasing a twitch-like app
[2:39:28] Greviev: Naver is everything in South Korea…

[2:40:30] Greviev: exactly so all this can be to leave the options open for a Naver app

[3:18:53] mavericks312: @Calphurnious TBC is cool its not in my top 3 or 4 though
[3:18:59] Darkfall_NL: TBC Classic Classic!
[3:19:02] SonofHorus82: I've gotten to the point with Wrath where, even though my guild is still progressing through ICC, I'm just bored with it.
[3:19:07] ClassicMalcontent: They should keep Wrath however as it's the last one I consider 'classic' in nature with the old world still present.
[3:19:14] drunkieduckie: are they going to restart? like after they do expansions on classic, go back to tbc?
[3:19:18] Robinhood1_: If the point is to move on, then why go back to Classic in the first place? lol
[3:19:19] Epicsapphire1988: @Calphurnious same i have a soft spot for TBC
[3:19:20] LeXieSterling: Doesn't FF put something in the game where you can stay in one exp but still be in current content
[3:19:23] Shurn_82: every era, would need a seperate team to fix ( likely)
[3:19:26] PacoOrcforlife: SOD is what I was looking for as a classic player
[3:19:29] Shurn_82: its not worth to them
[3:19:55] ArcaneSyntax: SoD is the first time I've actually enjoyed classic.
[3:19:57] Calphurnious: @mavericks312 I think for me it's wrath, then tbc when I was super addicted
[3:22:09] Zellidon: Kinda disappointed with the mage healing in SoD. I'm on priest now though and enjoying it
[3:22:33] CardinalTX: SoD has me hooked

[3:22:56] DoughBoi_Trev: @zellidon pretty sure they already nerfed mage healer, it was way to OP
[3:23:11] Shiaco: with prayer of healing priests are beast in classic so useful in dungeons
[3:23:20] Zellidon: yea I have a lvl 25 mage. it's terrible now
[3:24:34] Shiaco: ele shamans are also pretty disgusting in SoD
[3:24:49] Zellidon: I'm originally a priest main, shoulda just stuck with it instead of trying the mage lol
[3:25:19] Shiaco: I think the resto druid in SoD is a lot better as well

[3:30:24] chinfu303: bear tank is a pretty decent off tank because when they aren't needed they can fuck off in cat form

[5:45:39] ScintiWeiWei: you want to keep him in the middle
[5:45:40] MackPlays: And he only targets 2nd threat with it p2
[5:45:43] ScintiWeiWei: by the statue
[5:45:44] FLCarguy: its a dps check and stressful on your healers
[5:46:02] FLCarguy: half the raid usually dies
[5:46:09] Celicon: @FLCarguy very
[5:46:10] MackPlays: the chains
[5:46:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: need to be spread and dispel chains

[5:47:17] MackPlays: p2 phase 2
[5:47:35] GameOverz: also you want melee to max range into his butt. cause he targets the closest person to him with mind blasts. so its not so much a hassle on healers
