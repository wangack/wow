[0:08:30] nomountain2tall: goddamn
[0:09:17] cieloboi: I just play around with the dumbbels
[0:09:26] nomountain2tall: I like machines bc you cant fuck up using them lol
[0:09:29] hcmraven: Same, i go to gym for myself, i never understood gym culture anyway
[0:09:54] ct0460: Calisthenics is the word you are looking for, you use your own body weight instead of a machine.
[0:10:07] ct0460: I do those for warm ups.
[0:10:27] cieloboi: Yes
[0:10:28] ct0460: I'm down.
[0:10:57] Bence9811: yes
[0:10:59] hcmraven: Row machine
[0:11:06] ct0460: Yeah I call them the row machines.
[0:11:06] hcmraven: or whatever
[0:11:12] ct0460: Good chest and back workout.
[0:11:32] ct0460: Pull up inclines?
[0:11:56] nomountain2tall: what is that bro
[0:12:03] cannednudle: what
[0:12:23] cieloboi: Its not opinions were just confused
[0:12:27] ct0460: Yeah my gym list is mostly set up for my height and body weight, it's always the best way to go instead of going brain dead.
[0:12:48] Lt_milly: yeah that‚Äôs good
[0:12:48] hcmraven: Situps no?
[0:12:59] Lt_milly: no @hcmraven
[0:12:59] ct0460: Reverse situps or whatever the hell it's called.
[0:13:21] nomountain2tall: vtube on friday?
[0:13:21] ct0460: Bulgarian split squats are the bane of my existence.
[0:14:00] Lt_milly: lat pulldown?
[0:14:07] ct0460: So you pretty much get the basics down.
[0:14:10] masterpascoe: what does locking the staff mean?
[0:14:21] CallMiiChad: do the machines also make those noises?
[0:14:24] cieloboi: Im too dumb to remember all that. I do 200 push ups in as few sets as I can
[0:14:24] nomountain2tall: Do you do the same routinr every day of is it different every day?
[0:14:24] sob590: If staff drops you can't roll on it
[0:14:43] hcmraven: I always do like 2 min of streaches after each machine....
[0:14:52] ct0460: But yeah I noticed a big difference in your weight loss, proud of you man.
[0:15:17] ct0460: Well still, it's progress.
[0:15:50] CallMiiChad: how cold is it over there tommy?
[0:16:07] hcmraven: Didnt you had same issues last year you played WoW?
[0:16:18] N0t_Speedy: Did you guys get a lot of snow aswell @TommyKayLIVE
[0:16:24] ct0460: Don't remind me of cold right now, it's snowing here in the southern part of America and feels like hell frozen over.
[0:16:38] obi4amt3: people still play wow?
[0:16:58] ParticlezNZ: hate that about raids people locking loot its toxic af
[0:17:09] ct0460: Covid is a big reason for the massive surge in games like WoW.
[0:17:16] hcmraven: I havent played LoL like in 10 years or so, and that was only for a week KEKW
[0:17:42] Jarl_Thoman: catJAM

[0:18:44] N0t_Speedy: Best video game theme song ever
[0:19:12] Bence9811: I'm ready for raid
[0:19:26] hcmraven: @nomountain2tall Try the older ones then! BG2 is quite good for how old it is
[0:19:33] ct0460: Kinda wished they did a DLC for GTA4 where you play as Niko in the Yugo wars.
[0:20:24] nomountain2tall: @haix24287 That would never work for a gta game bro
[0:20:29] OiFun: is 1h of WarThunder still a thing ?
[0:20:33] ct0460: Bah a man can dream.
[0:20:47] scrives24whu: have you seen the eu4 1v1 map? very similar to the hoi4 one
[0:20:57] ct0460: I'm loading Warthunder as we speak.
[0:21:07] Amperspitz: are u enjoying pvp more than pve?
[0:21:18] hcmraven: How do you 1v1 in that?
[0:21:27] scrives24whu: @TommyKayLIVE habib is currently streaming it

[0:21:47] N0t_Speedy: https://www.twitch.tv/absolutehabibi
[0:22:06] ct0460: I been playing war thunder for years, and it wasn't always that bad till they started adding more cold war shit then that's when the grind got awful.
[0:22:06] Bence9811: I leveled all night long for this?
[0:22:20] Bence9811: no

[0:31:04] N0t_Speedy: @haix24287 I don't really have a problem with the grind, but the fact you can pay and skip hundreds of hours of work annoys me
[0:31:09] Barckman: Barckman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Tactics: Tanks tank, dps do dps, healers heal! Keep up the good work Tommy!
[0:31:38] SpiteSWE: Lets hope Kelris drop the staff :D
[0:31:39] ct0460: @n0t_speedy It ruins a lot of countries in big updates cause they see the skill level of these ass players and snub everyone else.
[0:31:54] N0t_Speedy: @haix24287 Ye
[0:31:54] Bence9811: why not raid with chat at night
[0:32:01] AtomicBit: is this tommy's first run or did he run yesterday?

[0:35:41] AdamAlgae: First time catching a wow stream, never would have guessed you played priest
[0:35:44] ct0460: @n0t_speedy I think you are thinking about another Object tank that is squished and its a battle pass tank so not a lot of people have it.
[0:35:48] AdamAlgae: You seem like a warrior player
[0:36:06] SpiteSWE: Prayer of Mending is too good tho, much better :D
[0:36:14] AdamAlgae: @SpiteSWE Homunculi is better
[0:36:24] jermo49: Tommy did you ever play the left kuomintang in kaiserreich after they got reworked?
[0:36:36] AdamAlgae: Homunculi increases the raid's dps by an insane amount
[0:36:37] CoconutFGC: hommuncili has 2m cd lasts 2ms
[0:36:43] kempen: I legit have no idea why I got banned, I don't play wow
[0:37:02] CoconutFGC: its good for bosses, reduced armor by 1k
[0:37:12] AdamAlgae: You just press it and three munchkins go zerg on the boss
[0:37:19] sob590: @kempen streaming a private server can legit get your Twitch account banned
[0:37:20] AdamAlgae: And they decrease its Armour rating by over 1000
[0:37:34] kempen: @sob590 Ah I didn't know that
[0:37:48] N0t_Speedy: @haix24287 Might be
