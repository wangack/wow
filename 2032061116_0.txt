[1:27:27] n0s0upbr0: I mean
[1:27:29] n0s0upbr0: Brother
[1:27:38] n0s0upbr0: Mage is fun because every group wants one
[1:27:38] orientalkiller12: No mage? Craaazy comp
[1:27:45] gambitenjoyer: true soup
[1:27:47] n0s0upbr0: I play hunter and u just don’t get invited past a certain key level
[1:27:52] n0s0upbr0: That’s why I quit the game
[1:27:52] gambitenjoyer: also true
[1:28:02] orientalkiller12: Fire/arcane actually funny
[1:28:03] n0s0upbr0: Once I’m in queue for over an hour not playing the game that’s it boys
[1:28:11] n0s0upbr0: And all of the keys say need mage
[1:28:13] Celestial990: missed your time with hunter

[1:28:23] Chunkstubbs: classic
[1:28:29] Farva_Shenanigans: maybe I’ll finish leveling my frost mage
[1:28:43] n0s0upbr0: @celestial990 I only play each season seriously for about 1.4-2 months I can never make it to the end for some reason
[1:28:53] n0s0upbr0: It’s cuz I go full hardcore in the beginning then I’m burnt before .5
[1:29:09] gambitenjoyer: i feel that
[1:29:10] Celestial990: well if your spec is op and wanted you could be motivated to play more
[1:29:14] Celestial990: thats what i meant
[1:29:26] n0s0upbr0: Oh if I was getting invited to keys sfill I’d prob be slamming some right now
[1:29:33] n0s0upbr0: Now I just do alt keys which are fun

[1:30:43] Farva_Shenanigans: been gearing my Druid up this week
[1:30:57] weezull: cds nuts
[1:31:09] Farva_Shenanigans: have a newborn so no real keys last 2 weeks
[1:31:11] n0s0upbr0: @itsyent I would but tbh I just try to snipe IO keys . Once my key goes to a level that I don’t need I have zero motivation to do it
[1:31:18] flockheart: unholy
[1:31:20] zeph_6: dying on fire is pretty bad but not as bad as boomie
[1:31:22] zeph_6: losing skb sucks
[1:31:25] pumae__: dying on outlaw feels fucking awful if you are playing kir
[1:31:27] the_rainmaker: dorki, does going mastery/haste vs vers/haste really matter for bear? my understand is all stats value is about the same.
[1:31:41] zeph_6: thank god dying on fire is impossible PEPW
[1:31:47] n0s0upbr0: Facts
[1:31:55] illPopper: dying as outlaw sucks
[1:32:05] manlyhandles: !civcheck zeph_6
[1:32:06] Nightbot: zeph_6 is 68% civilian.
[1:32:06] illPopper: you lose all of your cds and then have no aoe to press
[1:32:08] illPopper: at all
[1:32:08] manlyhandles: shame
[1:32:09] papach0ng: Play feral and it's 1:30
[1:32:14] ScapeeJ: If you play HO outlaw it isnt horrible
[1:32:15] dembro: 3m CD is indeed DIESOFCRINGE
[1:32:17] n0s0upbr0: fire mage is so fucking good at living
[1:32:19] manlyhandles: !civcheck
[1:32:19] Nightbot: manlyhandles is 5% civilian.
[1:32:22] manlyhandles: EZ
[1:32:22] zeph_6: what the fuck
[1:32:24] zeph_6: rigged
[1:32:34] Drazalas: Mages in general are good at living
[1:32:46] illPopper: @ScapeeJ the reason dying as outlaw sucks is because of UUH not any capstones
[1:32:58] menzlo: how much dps loss is orbital strike
[1:33:09] n0s0upbr0: Isn’t it like close to impossible to die as rogue
[1:33:18] n0s0upbr0: Don’t u guys have a 40% dr on a 30 second cooldown
[1:33:27] pumae__: @n0s0upbr0 yeah unless your group wipes
[1:33:42] menzlo: cringe pulsar and 3 min cd, solves both
[1:33:45] rebound_ttv: Just rogue harder 4Head
[1:33:56] Shadelikee: in pugs casts go through
[1:33:59] n0s0upbr0: @pumae__ true
[1:34:05] Nightbot: dorkiCheer Subscribe to my YouTube channel! @ https://www.youtube.com/c/Dorki
[1:34:06] Drazalas: @n0s0upbr0 only from aoe unless you run elusiveness
[1:34:06] illPopper: @n0s0upbr0 yes and no, that dr costs a global + energy, and it comes at the cost of losing cheat death, but the 30 second cd does have our CDR applied to it
[1:34:13] Exorcist_PG: whats this build? idk anything about boomies
[1:34:19] Farva_Shenanigans: frost is good until like key level 25 right? then fire?
[1:34:47] illPopper: and the 40% is only for aoe, its 20% for everything else
[1:34:53] Drazalas: Frost is always good. Ignite just has a different damage profile.
[1:34:55] n0s0upbr0: @illpopper yeah so ur pretty much not able to get 1 shot unless u play bad
[1:34:57] the_rainmaker: meow
[1:34:59] Nightbot: dorkiHey Join my Discord server! https://discord.gg/yHFTAZn
[1:35:10] n0s0upbr0: Same with mage
[1:35:14] n0s0upbr0: Cannot be one shotted
[1:35:37] Shadelikee: you can increase key level and stuff will do enough dmg to oneshot btw
[1:35:41] Farva_Shenanigans: mage almost feels like it has too many defensives
[1:35:44] illPopper: @n0s0upbr0 clearly coming from someone who doesnt understand how high value energy and a global is for rogue
[1:35:47] ScapeeJ: @n0s0upbr0 Mage has a lot of defensives. But if your not proactive with then and ur reactive u die
[1:36:15] n0s0upbr0: @illpopper no I completely understand that ur energy value means absolutely nothing if it means ur not gonna get one shot .

[1:36:52] kwizzzz: and Caut
[1:37:01] manlyhandles: and you hear them cry about it being on gcd so much
[1:37:10] n0s0upbr0: @farva_shenanigans on top of that their shifting power gives them their defensives back it’s fucking wild
[1:37:15] zeph_6: @manlyhandles you play warlock, stop speaking
[1:37:18] fat_european0: Is dorki nonverbal?
[1:37:26] dembro: Give every pure DPS class a cheat death Pog
[1:37:33] seeii: mages have dispersion that allows them to continue casting xdd

[1:37:42] fat_european0: nvm I had the tab muted, mb
[1:37:42] zeph_6: nuh uh
[1:38:02] zeph_6: Tssk i played dh in s1 i'm allowed to play it now
[1:38:05] flahhoz: wait wasnt alter in the game before bfa? or when did they add it?
[1:38:18] manlyhandles: wrong
[1:38:20] dembro: Added in Shadowlands, pretty sure
[1:38:24] fat_european0: @flahhoz It existed before, but it got removed in Legion I think? and then re-added in SL
[1:38:32] manlyhandles: alter was a dps cd in like mop
[1:38:34] fat_european0: old alter was more broken though since it worked on dps CDs as well
[1:38:44] flahhoz: reaaaaally
[1:38:47] dembro: CHILLY
[1:38:48] flahhoz: lol thats crazy
[1:38:49] fat_european0: Yeah
[1:38:53] the_rainmaker: does meld stop dot?
[1:38:57] manlyhandles: they would get fat combustions when combust was a dot
[1:39:01] manlyhandles: with alter
[1:39:08] fat_european0: You could also extend lust with it iirc
[1:39:16] dembro: Mages are apparently kind of weak to rot but I think that's true for most DPS 4Head
[1:39:32] flahhoz: @fat_european0 whaaat the hell
[1:39:34] n0s0upbr0: Honestly this hallway can make a group go full non verbal speechless at times
[1:39:48] fat_european0: @fat_european0 It was a super cool ability you could use to min/max like crazy

[1:40:39] preheats_lawyer: Maybe a hot take, but I don't think mage defensives are that absurd when you look at how many exist in the game rn. So many tanky DPS specs. They should prune defensives imo

[1:41:46] Readyforbagels: @preheats_lawyer cooked take but agreed on prune defensives
[1:41:51] Readyforbagels: only for mages
[1:41:58] preheats_lawyer: @n0s0upbr0 Idk who's the best or not. But it's not like Warlocks, ret paladins, fury warriors, rogues, WW, DKs etc. exist
[1:42:10] preheats_lawyer: Like I agree mage has too many, but it's not some massive outlier I think
[1:42:17] MiIkshake_: become nonverbal 变得非语言 tiger paw incident 虎掌事件 ambition dissolves 野心解散 chance for feline bear main to enter the party 语言心虎 NA's last hope real? 野心解
[1:42:19] zeph_6: nah mage is an outlier
[1:42:26] n0s0upbr0: Yeah mage is the outlier
[1:42:30] zeph_6: mage is an outlier among the outliers
[1:42:35] zeph_6: it is that good
[1:42:38] Minigamer911: Ret literally only has 3, 80% of them don't take hand of protection, and the 3rd is a 5 minute CD without reduction talents
[1:42:41] n0s0upbr0: Brother they have a no bullshit full heal defensive on a 30 second cooldown
[1:42:42] Farva_Shenanigans: what does fury warrior have? spell reflect and a 30% dr right?
[1:42:48] marcuuus1337: aug is more and more out of 25-28 keys are they not that good anymore?
[1:43:02] menzlo: give everyone ironbark and that's it
[1:43:02] weezull: Says the boomkin
[1:43:08] preheats_lawyer: @zeph_6 I don't think the difference between mage & rogue is that big. Biggest thing is mass barrier, but rogue has 3% dr through poisons
[1:43:11] TheFruitseller: every should have hunter defensives :^)
[1:43:12] snarky03: you get 5 dps dungeons
[1:43:13] anthippo: when are you playing with your Mdi team?
[1:43:13] Drazalas: 1 minute for alter time
[1:43:14] dembro: YEP
[1:43:18] Drazalas: not 30 s
[1:43:29] pezinafm: Whac-A-Mole
[1:43:41] Varthar: shifting power shouldn’t work on defensives, interrupt etc
[1:43:43] Dumeni: too much stuff that does absurd damage in the game. like idk if spear goblins in this dungeon should 1 shot someone
[1:43:46] Marz311: !monitor
[1:43:46] Cantwingrr: remember early season 2 when you were flying around valdrakken talking about dungeon one shots
[1:43:47] Nightbot: got the new released 32" 4k 240hz oled monitor from alienware
[1:43:47] dawshan12345: and there is 5 things to dispell while doing it and dpsing :D
[1:43:52] EmmaZen: Sadge
[1:43:52] hdott52: i feel like that is just a scaling issue, they need to work on +25 higher scaling
[1:43:59] Readyforbagels: @marcuuus1337 they are still the same, great
[1:44:03] n0s0upbr0: Mirror images/alter time/ ice cold/ dwarf racial / own barrier / mass barrier / shifting power to get them all back
[1:44:05] Repsie: I just hate the random damage that is non-scripted
[1:44:08] Celestial990: @hdott52 xdd keys higher than 20 basically dont exist for blizzard
[1:44:13] Minigamer911: It's so weird people think of ret as tanky when they've only been able to live since Season 2
[1:44:19] HolyHotcakesBruh: NOOOO
[1:44:26] Minigamer911: They were wet paper at launch
[1:44:30] vaxxxeee: @n0s0upbr0 forgot g.invis xdd
[1:44:31] Readyforbagels: get bolted
[1:44:34] n0s0upbr0: Oh
[1:44:35] morefishHD: how do you filter mobs
[1:44:36] n0s0upbr0: And invis
[1:44:40] n0s0upbr0: The 60% one
[1:44:43] Drazalas: @n0s0upbr0 You don't SP to get your defensives back though, so that's massive cap most of the time
[1:44:53] Drazalas: we get it, you don't like mages and barely know how they play.
[1:45:04] n0s0upbr0: @drazalas u don’t but it’s still definitely used in that window where it’s getting cool down
[1:45:12] preheats_lawyer: @Minigamer911 Which got fixed with the rework. Why would we take previous iterations into account when it's irrelevant now? They're extremely tanky atm
[1:45:30] Drazalas: As fire you use it early to get IB stacks back, as frost right in your opener after you dump cms and orb
[1:45:31] n0s0upbr0: @drazalas I’m very aware of how mages play and what shifting power is used for
[1:45:34] Drazalas: So no, most of the time you don't
[1:45:41] Celestial990: you might not shifting to get them back but pretty mch every time you press shifting it is gonna reduce 1 or more of your defensives
[1:45:43] Minigamer911: That's like the whole saying Shadow is bad when they were top dog last season
[1:45:44] Drazalas: and combust for fire, not gonna bother
[1:46:05] orientalkiller12: Shifting is a 3 sec channeling that reduces cds by 12sec in 3sec and ye u use it for blast charges not defs
[1:46:15] n0s0upbr0: Yeah I’m completely aware of how shifting power works I have a fire mage . I’m just pointing out that it also cools down the defensives
[1:46:27] Farva_Shenanigans: is fire rotation still wild like it was in shadowlands during combustion?
[1:46:28] shmeat: when they adding shaman tank to retail is the real question
[1:46:40] n0s0upbr0: @farva_shenanigans the fire rotation is about as simple as BM hunter
[1:46:40] Farva_Shenanigans: mage is the one class I’ve never really played
[1:46:45] orientalkiller12: No fire rotation is easier af
[1:46:46] zeph_6: still cant believe they removed ozumat dmg from details...
[1:46:47] zeph_6: 1984
[1:46:50] fat_european0: @Farva_Shenanigans Nah it's the same everytime now. It's very easy
[1:46:54] orientalkiller12: Just need high apm
[1:46:56] n0s0upbr0: Fire is a 4-5 button spec
[1:46:56] dembro: Fire is EZ PZ yep
[1:47:00] Celestial990: @Drazalas "shifting is used in the opener so it doenst reduce defensives" ??? is this a raid take? you realize an opener in an m+ pull or boss means youve used defensives in the past 2 minutes right
[1:47:01] Farva_Shenanigans: oh really?
[1:47:03] Farva_Shenanigans: damn
[1:47:05] n0s0upbr0: Yeah it’s a joke
[1:47:05] fat_european0: The rework made fire into one of the easiest specs in the game
[1:47:17] Aggroboy: what is this 4D comp
[1:47:17] fat_european0: it used to be one of the hardest to min/max with pyroclasm & rop
[1:47:21] Farva_Shenanigans: I know you don’t flamestrike anymore right? aoe is all ignite ?
[1:47:24] snarky03: 181k HPS damn
[1:47:25] Minigamer911: @preheats_lawyer They are in line with what I would expect a plate melee class to be. The fact they still are less tanky than several cloth wearers is odd
[1:47:28] n0s0upbr0: I’d say fire and bm hunter are about the exact same
[1:47:31] shmeat: 31 wm holy
[1:47:31] Drazalas: @Celestial990 the whole point is you don't optimize SP usage around defensives smooth brain.
[1:47:33] n0s0upbr0: U track skb u track frenzy
[1:47:42] onlyxanz: fire same as bm is blasphemy
[1:47:53] Beyondbladez: dorki you got any advice for 25-26 throne
[1:48:00] orientalkiller12: Not easy. Its still considered medium-hard if u watch yt m+ video by skillcapped who went out recently. But its just apm. Few buttons
[1:48:08] Celestial990: @Drazalas ty wrinkly brain. and my point is that vast majority of the time when you press shifting for whatever reason, it's gonna reduce some defensive
[1:48:11] n0s0upbr0: @drazalas brother we get it shifting power is used to get ur abilities back for a good combust window or a skb window
[1:48:14] n0s0upbr0: We get it bro
[1:48:15] Farva_Shenanigans: damn. my mages name is frostfather gotta rename him flamedaddy now
[1:48:29] shmeat: what is higher apm, ele sham or fire mage
[1:48:37] Aggroboy: flamestrike still seems good at +20 and below
[1:48:37] orientalkiller12: Firemage
[1:48:38] fat_european0: @Farva_Shenanigans You can just go frostfire hero talents next xpac and keep frostfather name 5Head
[1:48:38] dembro: @Farva_Shenanigans Or Arcanepapa if you raid
[1:48:54] Ronningx: ele sham for sure
[1:49:10] orientalkiller12: Nope. Ele is harder but not higher apm
[1:49:21] Farva_Shenanigans: ele is my main lol
[1:49:23] orientalkiller12: But much harder tbh xD
[1:49:32] Aggroboy: is BM the easiest DPS to learn?
[1:49:37] shmeat: ele fun as shit just brrrrr everything
[1:49:43] n0s0upbr0: @aggroboy fire or bm
[1:49:43] orientalkiller12: Ye bm by far then ret
[1:49:46] shmeat: but spreading flame shock kinda booty
[1:49:48] dembro: @Aggroboy Fury is easier but BM isn't hard
[1:49:49] marcuuus1337: aug is more and more out of 25-28 keys are they not that good anymore? every key above 28 i see there is a aug….
[1:50:05] Aggroboy: @dembro Fury APM will rekt my wrist
[1:50:14] n0s0upbr0: Bm APM is high too though
[1:50:27] dembro: BM is a melee spec with a 40yd range, it's great Pog
[1:50:29] ScapeeJ: @n0s0upbr0 BM is def way easier then fire lolol
[1:50:37] Farva_Shenanigans: fury is fun. just hate 5 target cap classes. at least ele is 6
[1:50:38] n0s0upbr0: @scapeej true
[1:50:52] fat_european0: Aug fotm rerollers are war criminals
[1:50:53] zeph_6: augs in pugs are all fucking demons from hell
[1:50:54] Zir_aus: the boosted aug run out of skill at that level
[1:50:56] zeph_6: and WILL brick your key
[1:50:56] manlyhandles: they are io leeches
[1:51:01] Messyah: I agree, uncap fury
[1:51:12] Kayjin1223: There are a lot of Aug key terrorists.
[1:51:17] Minigamer911: I agree, cap ranged, uncap melee
[1:51:27] Zir_aus: unholy o7
[1:51:29] Aqril1993: Aug io = score ×7
[1:51:29] Minigamer911: Except blade fury
[1:51:30] n0s0upbr0: Yeah augs aren’t fun to play with
[1:51:33] Minigamer911: Leave that capped
[1:51:34] m_dep: somebody should make an addon/weakaura similar to details but tracks how well augs are timing their shit with other peoples cooldowns
[1:51:37] Aggroboy: I am terrorized far more by ragey DH's than augs
[1:51:39] m_dep: so you have some measure in a pug of how good an aug is
[1:51:39] Kayjin1223: I played Aug for a while this season but tbh got bored of it. It's not a very engaging playstyle.
[1:51:50] marcuuus1337: same as every class at that level more the player behind thats boosted
[1:51:56] scrubthetank: @m_dep wowanalyzer does this a little bit
[1:51:59] fat_european0: @Zir_aus Nah UH cranks. It's so cool seeing Meeres do top 10 keys with no aug & no real lust playing UHDK
[1:52:06] scrubthetank: gotta log though :/
[1:52:09] m_dep: @scrubthetank but live while doing the key like details?
[1:52:15] m_dep: @scrubthetank yeah :(
[1:52:21] m_dep: I just wanna know while I'm playing how well the aug is doing
[1:52:27] Kayjin1223: That might require the advanced combat log to do.
[1:52:32] Shadelikee: Augs and DH's - you need to remove 200 IO to determine their actual IO
[1:52:43] oakeri: HUH
[1:52:43] shmeat: doesn’t uhdk just get better the higher the key is
[1:53:00] fat_european0: Every pug DH I play with does crazy AoE dps but are doing tank dmg on ST
[1:53:06] Kayjin1223: Bad DHs yelling at Fire Mages in the Ignite build for not doing 400k DPS never gets old.
[1:53:06] n0s0upbr0: It’s just disgusting seeing players get title when they never got it before they only got it as augmentation evoker
[1:53:08] m_dep: @shmeat thats why its super present in high keys/tgp and not present in mdi
[1:53:09] m_dep: oh wait

[3:24:44] buzzkill00: boomies had 40secs on their personal and surv instincts was stronger
[3:24:53] tavi2530: karma was 100% dmg prevention back then, which was dumb because it also made it the best offensive CD in the game lmao
[3:25:19] tavi2530: "use karma on CD" was the only way to parse
[3:25:34] bebexach: I think whoever does the class tuning for a boomie thinks that going into bear is an actual defensive. But that's not the way the class is supposed to be. You're not supposed to have to go into bear form to survive shit and like have no chance to do damage in the meantime.
[3:25:42] edenjtv: @dorki you ever thought about doing a video series with all 5 roles playing off meta spec pushing rating?
[3:25:44] Thasin22: Even with the defensive WW has i dont feel tanky on it.

[3:33:31] SHARJILO: you not tanking this season @dorki?
[3:33:40] SteveEH: ye bfa lol been a while
[3:33:44] bebexach: @dinokaze Those are immunities and as immunities and the point of them is to completely negate damage, although turtle doesn't do that, it just reflects it. But going into bearform is not an immunity. You can and you will die through bearform as the only thing bearform does is increase health and armor which is much similar to a defensive
[3:33:52] tavi2530: @dorki do you bother with cancelaura macro for pulsar and starlord?

[3:36:28] suginai: prot warrior is absolutely insane vs this boss
