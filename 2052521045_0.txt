[2:39:09] nerleywhirly: How will DH effect LeBron's legacy?
[2:39:09] Kanooog: @ramose89 DH - I have Monk, I don't like their flips and the port isn't ideal.... well for me. Plus their moves are goofy looking

[2:41:18] Kanooog: @SweRobb 100% When I returned from Wrath I made a DH and I've tried 7 other classes at max level. DH seems to be the one I go to when I just want to have fun.
[2:41:19] aTactical: I had to deal with my house flooding all day so I missed it
[2:41:32] danger_daft: Nahj is nice with it
[2:41:54] Facetiou5: Dh is fun yee

[2:55:33] Kanooog: @SweRobb What I recommend - Play DH to learn the meta if you are figuring out Arena. But keybind DH Stun to the same button as Rogue Stun, do that for all the abilities that are similar for muscle memory.  Eventually you'll become better in general and Rogue wont be as hard to learn now becase you are better.
