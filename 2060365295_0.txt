[0:04:59] thisisthotcaller: Hey Mes! any idea why trill was playing the weird belt / bracers embellishment? havent seen those used in arena before
[0:05:15] Anonymityy: Honest thoughts on whaaz rogue getting benched for a dh and 2nd place, pikaboo fighting for his life for third place and MCLOVIN rogue going undefeated in the finals? Why everyone on pikaboo and whaaz nuts when trill mops the floor with them playing his like 5th alt. even the casters play into the pikaboo vs whaaz conversation
[0:05:52] Anonymityy: Mclovin deserve his respect
[0:07:04] terranapart: @notmes Gratz!!
[0:08:28] VAINSx: congratz Mes!

[0:12:56] nameyourform: grats
[0:13:00] terranapart: Drama
[0:13:34] Anonymityy: Idk man i hear you but also all i hear is about how good pikaboo and whaaz are on rogue and how good sam is a boomkin... all true... but like trills a god wheres the respect
[0:13:45] zachgamegodx: dh destro rsham very popular comp on EU
[0:14:08] avenueone: trill gets the mr world of warcraft title
[0:14:39] americanmoses18: MR MES CUP 2 CHAMPS EZPZ
[0:15:01] terranapart: Gotta kill observer asap
[0:15:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH doesn't have as many stuns as a rogue but it makes up for that with way more damage
[0:15:22] Ashmeedel: Ello Mes. Im curious now, if le pomp locked in double destro/rsham, how chaotic would that be?
[0:15:32] Ashmeedel: a.k.a. the mistake on stream where is showed that
[0:15:51] thisisthotcaller: Hey Mes! any idea why trill was playing the weird belt / bracers embellishment? havent seen those used in arena before
[0:16:01] NPBeharry: congrats on the dub
[0:16:02] zachgamegodx: sadly chaos bolt is only 20-30% of ur overall but it's a good amount of ur burst
[0:16:18] zachgamegodx: i guess these days their burst is portals and instants too
[0:16:22] NPBeharry: clean 4-0 put the frogs back in the pond
[0:16:22] zachgamegodx: yeah true
[0:16:24] McLarge: There's also another 5% from Chaos Brand in addition to the 10% from Chaotic Imprint
[0:16:28] krome2dadome: there's 2 chaos portals
[0:16:58] zachgamegodx: there 's 1 that sends out a mini chaos bolt, doesn't hit hard doesn't scale with talent modifiers
[0:17:01] dubbfiend: does ret always play devotion aura in arena?
[0:17:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Boomy likes DH for that chaos brand
[0:17:23] krome2dadome: there's a chaos bolt and the fast channeled one
[0:17:23] zachgamegodx: other portals are 400k cumulative
[0:17:29] zachgamegodx: flame rift might be 600k
[0:18:28] zachgamegodx: one of the good rifts does do chaos dmg so 2/5 rifts can benefit
[0:19:16] zachgamegodx: ye i saw kzfox dmg, 15% extra dmg goes along way...plus5% attack power
[0:19:33] zachgamegodx: nah i mean
[0:19:37] zachgamegodx: fistweaver gives 15%
[0:19:41] zachgamegodx: warr gives battle shout
[0:19:47] zachgamegodx: his dmg is rly high
[0:20:28] terranapart: Chuck's insane. Can't believe he was playing at that level while sick.
[0:20:34] zachgamegodx: he was prolly jsut playign toxic
[0:21:25] itstherealloki: did you look at the hero talents for dk? seems like they might help alot with survivability
[0:21:25] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[0:21:37] Anonymityy: prolly gonna have to look him up on the tournament server or armory thishotcalller not sure if the undefeated championship team is eager to hang over their  hundred of hours of testing to everyone :P
[0:21:38] zachgamegodx: rogue likes the infuriious boots bc ur always procing it on cd and its usually good use
[0:21:43] Moobot: Please be sure to ask permission before posting links in chat! (@thisisthotcaller)
[0:21:44] notmes: 604/12946 = 4.6%
[0:22:07] ArtofAzeroth: Hi, Mes. Grats on tourney
[0:22:25] thisisthotcaller: oh i cant post links, he wasnt playing toxic @zachgamegodx  - he was playing old spirits wristwraps
[0:22:41] thisisthotcaller: and the belt
[0:22:57] thisisthotcaller: string of spiritual knick kancks
[0:23:02] veecakes: 24 hours???
[0:23:26] americanmoses18: !permit @thisisthotcaller
[0:23:27] StreamElements: @thisisthotcaller, you will not get timed out for the next 60 seconds.
[0:23:27] Moobot: @americanmoses18 @thisisthotcaller will not get timed out for the next 3m (@americanmoses18)
[0:23:37] Anonymityy: @thisisthotcaller if trill has some new elite super combo that went undefeated in AWC championship idk if hes ready to just hang it out to anyone after he spend hundreds of hours theory crafting and testing to get the magic
[0:23:45] zachgamegodx: What does the combo do
[0:23:46] c0jaK: every day is 24h when you think about it
[0:24:09] americanmoses18: Saususge @c0jak
[0:24:12] NPBeharry: are you excited for the cross region games
[0:24:27] NPBeharry: I’m happy to see eu vs na again
[0:24:30] NPBeharry: they did
[0:24:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: They showed the bracket yes
[0:24:36] infraredpen: ya
[0:24:40] magikmalaki: The move vs echo
[0:24:43] NPBeharry: you’re against the winner of the eu gauntlet
[0:24:43] c0jaK: Saususge @americanmoses18
[0:24:44] theodeth: you're playing the winner of EU gauntlet
[0:26:01] NPBeharry: idk but I hope the move plays more sub rps I think it’s better
[0:26:08] Anhak: question all games are played on the same turny realm correct? or is there an eu turny realm?
[0:26:38] NPBeharry: that’s interesting
[0:26:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they rotate servers so that ping isn't totally one-sided
[0:27:21] Anhak: so higher seed then following games losing team
[0:27:22] bowlmoose: whazz was hinting on coming to NA for the games
[0:27:38] Anhak: thats smart ye
[0:27:58] Anhak: if ur not the number 1 seed i think its smart
[0:28:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: They say lower ping helps with kicks, so for him it would help to always have a lower ping
[0:28:48] Axesmittayyy: mes what class are you prepped to go in as if you need to be swapped in for awc?
[0:29:01] NPBeharry: it would be amazing if they bring back blizzcon lan AWC for the war within
[0:29:07] NPBeharry: I really miss it
[0:29:17] disquared: !gamble 3000
[0:29:18] StreamElements: disquared lost 3000 runes in roulette and now has 2147467732 runes! FeelsBadMan
[0:29:29] NPBeharry: !gamble all
[0:29:29] StreamElements: NPBeharry went all in and lost every single one of their 145 runes LUL
[0:29:31] Rainbowmes: devs having an emergency meeting since a dk won a tournament game
[0:29:37] Anhak: i wonder if its better to be like in the LA area with 2 ping to the server for turny realm or be like NY and have 15 25 w.e it is and then have 85 vs eu instead of 120 from la or w.e
[0:29:43] Rainbowmes: can’t have a dk win a game even against another dk
[0:29:53] dawsonator171: if you want i can log in to heal. SoD leveling has me so spaced out.
[0:30:18] xiliketurtlex: is it 2 vs 1?
[0:30:21] Anhak: dude that 5 kill match today was nutty
[0:30:34] caus3_0: Yeah that was funny af
[0:30:38] NPBeharry: yeah that was tragic
[0:30:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Gum was amazing
[0:30:45] nikthevoker: he should of sent full dam
[0:31:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: The dev evoker was spamming heals on the frost DK, and it didn't help much at all
[0:31:20] buttbutterson: its pretty disheartening yeah. I think devoker missed fire breath which sealed the deal
[0:32:10] Ashmeedel: You guys make pvp look fun but I suck at it. I'll just stick to doing keys/raid lol
[0:32:37] swaggitto: congrats on the big W
[0:32:49] Anhak: Kermit: I healed an  11 of one of the new super dungeons last night as a 380 rdruid. it was something already
[0:33:30] c0jaK: c0jaK gifted 12 months of Tier 1 to caus3_0. They've gifted 2316 months in the channel! 
[0:33:30] StreamElements: caus3_0 just subscribed for 12 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[0:33:34] Anhak: some might argue i didnt heal i would say i was spaming regrowth a lot KEKW
[0:34:14] terranapart: mesDragon1 mesDragon2
[0:34:19] c0jaK: that guy dropped a first time chat laughing at fdk
[0:34:25] c0jaK: he earned it
[0:35:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Xeek is good
[0:36:22] krome2dadome: zero pity for frost dks
[0:37:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think frost DK is probably just evidence of how setting up a spec for mythic+ can be bad for PvP playability
[0:38:38] Anhak: i would need to look
[0:38:41] dawsonator171: I have zero pit for warriors
[0:38:44] Anhak: id say less then 5 of them are in title range
[0:38:45] buttbutterson: they’re not, it’s unholy and it requires massive pulls to be viable
[0:38:48] dawsonator171: but frost is good in M+
[0:38:48] Ashmeedel: The last time I did m+ with a frost dk was last season
[0:38:58] MedtnerFangirl: Obliterate cleave go brrr but not brrr enough
[0:38:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: 1 minute CDs and 2 minute CDs are generally mythic+ stuff
[0:39:04] dawsonator171: meta is not really taht set.
[0:39:07] Ashmeedel: Unholy is good for m+
[0:39:32] Anhak: @wEiRdO_dUdE yes but that has to translate to aoe damage
[0:39:43] Anhak: in the case of frost dk it does not
[0:40:09] Lilalime: Dk needs a rework
[0:40:15] Ashmeedel: Big thing with M+ is "do you play a class that has uncapped target aoe"
[0:40:58] Anhak: useful aoe and decent ST is the thing and then u got like fire mages which has it all..
[0:41:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Frost DK is the #6 spec for AOE in the raid DPS chart
[0:41:43] SamusWRLD: Hey chat and Mes, could someone tell me if i should play arms or fury since i cant find a straight answer
[0:41:44] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:41:44] dankNstein_: @ashmeedel meh a lot of clases perform well with target caps, its more if a spec can live one shots and has team utility
[0:42:44] Anhak: 6/6 on new runes only rune im missing is the horrible one that cost gold lol
[0:43:24] Lilalime: Wound gameplay is just budget combo points. At least in pvp they do dmg. In pve it just feels awful.
[0:44:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoWhead sometimes posts the Mythic+ DPS charts, but I can't seem to find a recent one
[0:44:52] dawsonator171: I'd have to see the time trials stats, but I do think quite a few teams were running frost dk.
[0:44:52] dankNstein_: I've probably played with 2 frost dk's in the past 2 seasons
[0:45:01] Anhak: yea something like spriest which brings AOE offhealing PI a very useful buff
[0:45:21] dawsonator171: unholy is only good if you can set up a damage funnel into a boss, because of festermight.
[0:45:44] dankNstein_: Unholy is good in time trials because they are doing massive pulls and lower end keys
[0:45:57] dankNstein_: I think groups are doing like 12 min 20s
[0:46:09] iRarityz: what are the best comps rn for 3s to push glad with?
[0:46:16] Lilalime: There are so many better speccs if you want funnel
[0:46:20] MarioTF2: @notmes fdk clip?
[0:46:20] bowlmoose: what addon are you using for your team names?  shows the character name in their class colors
[0:46:22] Anhak: there is currently 0 frost dks in title cutoff range
[0:46:29] honsou2: @iRarityz combine rogue/dh/warlock however u want
[0:46:39] Anhak: 1 is VERY CLOSE and probably should get it with bans and stuff but
[0:46:56] dankNstein_: Cutoff is going to keep going up
[0:47:05] zachgamegodx: Did u show chat how they got there
[0:47:06] Anhak: yes i know
[0:47:08] zachgamegodx: actually crazy gamfe
[0:47:11] dankNstein_: Especially when r1 players start doing more sales
[0:47:13] Anhak: were using the cut off right now tho
[0:47:20] zachgamegodx: i think budda played it bad
[0:47:21] MedtnerFangirl: that roll was sick out of the Fire Breath
[0:47:26] iRarityz: @honsou2 is dh and rogue together good?
[0:47:27] MedtnerFangirl: and then this
[0:47:28] buttbutterson: that fire breath woulda ko’d
[0:47:47] Anhak: 3 unholy dks in title cutoff
[0:47:51] Anhak: 4 * sorry
[0:47:52] dawsonator171: looks like most time trial teams ran fire/lock/sp with DH tank.
[0:47:55] freshdots321: mes want to q some 3s
[0:47:57] zachgamegodx: can non healers initiate a rez
[0:48:05] Anhak: yea frost has 0
[0:48:06] FlynnFluff: wait xeek is a wow dev?
[0:48:08] Anhak: i was comparing it
[0:48:20] morgraz: frost isnt good for anything really
[0:48:21] Talason: mesQt
[0:48:24] zachgamegodx: LOL
[0:48:28] FlynnFluff: must have miss heard
[0:48:29] zachgamegodx: dev= devestation @FlynnFluff
[0:48:37] dawsonator171: ricky, convince mes to play feral.
[0:49:02] americanmoses18: WECHARD
[0:49:16] Anhak: @dawsonator171 time trials is also different then pushing those things are 2 different gameplays but in mdi u might see an unholy played same with like hunter and stuff
[0:49:26] Anhak: ye
[0:49:30] Anhak: and ur not 40 yet
[0:49:31] zachgamegodx: is cdew out for tn?
[0:49:34] Anhak: im worried :)
[0:49:36] krome2dadome: about to hit 39
[0:49:43] krome2dadome: mike just hit it
[0:49:49] nikthevoker: think i give up on sod LUL
[0:50:31] theodeth: after watching the hardcore stuff, softcore kinda doesn't do it for me
[0:51:28] honsou2: truly sad
[0:51:39] krome2dadome: dh can choose not to MS to be fair
[0:51:43] krome2dadome: and just be tankier
[0:51:49] dawsonator171: @theodeth generally that's how i feel, hardcore is just move exciting and stimulating.
[0:51:57] dawsonator171: pretty sure we are thinking about the same thing. Kappa
[0:51:59] Gardor: i still dont really get why dh even needs or got ms
[0:52:37] zachgamegodx: Dh playing the deflecting dance talent is kinda crazy paired with that giga vers'd warrior
[0:52:42] zachgamegodx: how do u kill anything
[0:52:45] buttbutterson: I think their dumb logic has to do with their impression that grips too strong so they keep beating dk into submission
[0:53:08] zachgamegodx: there is a value to having the ms class there with the added tankiness
[0:53:13] zachgamegodx: but also
[0:53:41] zachgamegodx: i did say a couple weeks ago why not try making prepping a ret or something but u were steadfast on that damn dk
[0:54:02] krome2dadome: u gotta be downbad to play with a warr over anything else
[0:54:37] krome2dadome: if u play with a fw? KEKW
[0:54:44] zachgamegodx: so what do you wanna play for awc now
[0:55:00] krome2dadome: oh nah
[0:55:11] ChumpSeason: war is underrated cuz of dh and outlaw strength. but i think they're good
[0:55:23] morgraz: tour best toon right now is probaby your ele
[0:55:33] krome2dadome: who was the rls?
[0:56:06] StreamElements: Supportal Strike just donated $50.00 mesWeckso mesWeckso mesDad
[0:56:06] zachgamegodx: fury wasn’t seen except in the very low qualifiers
[0:56:08] Anhak: rls was played? Pog
[0:56:14] nikthevoker: think i got replaced in sod too LUL
[0:56:27] Anhak: nik u have a spot with us :)
[0:56:31] zachgamegodx: tons of rls
[0:56:44] dawsonator171: mes needed a pick me up.
[0:57:19] LokixSun: wasn't there a frost dk vs unholy dk matchup?
[0:57:42] Anhak: KEKW
[0:57:49] Anhak: dk = ded KEKW
[0:57:51] honsou2: @LokixSun the only time a dk won LUL
[0:57:52] zachgamegodx: hahaha
[0:57:53] Gardor: what spec do you think is the most underrated/underrepresented?
[0:58:07] LokixSun: @honsou2 lol
[0:58:19] eMBeaR64oz: that 2v3 into 1v2 into win was fun to watch lol
[0:58:24] zachgamegodx: bloods dead too right
[0:58:36] dawsonator171: I have more success as frost in shuffle over unholy, and I don't understand why.
[0:59:06] zachgamegodx: i think it’s fair to dislike their comp just like prot comps
[0:59:09] honsou2: @dawsonator171 the micro cc is more important as unholy so prolly that
[1:00:09] nikthevoker: if you got druid spot tom lmk
[1:00:36] dawsonator171: @honsou2 you hit the micro exactly the same way, for similar reasons, not sure if difference.
[1:01:02] buttbutterson: to be fair, they gimped it a couple weeks ago
[1:01:06] itstherealloki: do you think warrior or ret will be better for you guys?
[1:01:13] zachgamegodx: i think you were the only one holding on to dk
[1:01:19] krome2dadome: well if u need to spam q warr/dh lemme know :) im a dh main now so
[1:01:25] honsou2: @dawsonator171 except you dont because unholy has more cc spells?
[1:01:41] dawsonator171: @honsou2 they don't. I think you're quite lost.
[1:01:50] swaggitto: plz buff enh lol
[1:01:50] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[1:02:00] honsou2: @dawsonator171 they do, gnaw and leap
[1:02:17] dawsonator171: @honsou2 dragon, relentless.
[1:02:30] buttbutterson: if they touch enhance they need to remove the lottery from it
[1:02:31] dawsonator171: remorseless.
[1:02:35] dawsonator171: brain sputter
[1:02:41] zachgamegodx: if you put howton and saul on an awc team they’d be in the gauntlet
[1:03:00] zachgamegodx: nope
[1:03:01] Drathimos: its unfair how hunter is almost never in the meta despite having three dps specs. having more dps specs should mean they have more chance of being good, just look at rogue, lock and mage
[1:03:07] zachgamegodx: Unitas beat ‘em out
[1:03:14] krome2dadome: my pres evoker buddy said he randomly farmed ladder last few days as feral/sp. they weren't losing to anything in particular per his words
[1:03:18] honsou2: @dawsonator171 l2p frost brain
[1:03:38] morgraz: jellybeans is probably the least played awc sompetitor
[1:03:43] Anhak: i just talked to ave about this
[1:03:50] dawsonator171: @honsou2 I think you're an idiot, and that's the end of this conversation.
[1:03:53] terranapart: Dark Ranger might make Hunters great again
[1:04:14] honsou2: @dawsonator171 you cant read and you talk like theres beard on your neck
[1:04:21] Anhak: as a casual viewer you might think jelly is just a bad player cause he doesnt get to play
[1:04:42] Karaelolz: @honsou2 FeelsWeirdMan
[1:04:48] Anhak: yea yea im not saying he is bad but u get what im saying
[1:05:01] terranapart: @notmes check out Jelly's interview with blizz on dark ranger at his yt channel
[1:05:19] vibesham: Scatter play used to be a thing too
[1:05:23] vibesham: Not so much anymore
[1:06:04] morgraz: dks are meant to be in the middle of the fight but they cant survive it
[1:06:11] morgraz: and if they have to kite they do nothing
[1:06:45] morgraz: they are supposed to win by attrition and they cant
[1:07:04] nikthevoker: feral/fister/devoker is farming EU ladder
[1:07:24] nikthevoker: mesferal stonks rising
[1:07:39] TheBackstabi: DKs gonna get a Death Gate they can warp back to
[1:07:44] krome2dadome: def farming im sure Kappa
[1:08:07] buttbutterson: I’d love for death strike to do anything again
[1:08:38] dawsonator171: I think feral needs a second charge of wall like it used to or the duration needs buffed. 6 seconds is ultra sad.
[1:09:04] dawsonator171: especially for a 3 minute CD
[1:09:51] terranapart: Ele Shaman!
[1:09:56] LokixSun: ret smashing with war, right?
[1:10:57] dawsonator171: ele gets countered by rsham, and rsham is popular atm also.
[1:11:07] brindleindle: What is warr's place in the meta ya think?
[1:11:16] coffahol: Mes you ever play a caster?
[1:11:26] zachgamegodx: it’s kind of a caster melee meta, unless you’d prep for a back pocket counter comp Idk, maybe something you could pair with Sam would be more valuable than practicing cleave comps
[1:13:09] leeka: wtb DH friends to play with
[1:13:15] nikthevoker: stv event so goddam buggy
[1:13:24] nikthevoker: i couldnt even get on the same layer as my group
[1:13:30] McLarge: @leeka You literally have me, sir
[1:13:32] nikthevoker: layering randomly
[1:13:59] buttbutterson: id not put all my cards into dh on the off chance that they’re slated for dmg nerfs. their burst is kinda nutty rn
[1:14:52] buttbutterson: I think now that the first set of awc is done the nerfs might go in
[1:15:01] buttbutterson: that’s historically what happens
[1:15:03] krome2dadome: on every level u mean?
[1:15:12] leeka: @McLarge we need to play more
[1:15:38] zachgamegodx: not sure, think dh is more problematic than rogue
[1:16:14] zachgamegodx: minor changes
[1:16:24] krome2dadome: i could care less about tuning in regards to awc if im being honest
[1:17:20] krome2dadome: just in the sense of idc if they do it before or after tourney
[1:17:44] buttbutterson: I like the new approach, with the caveat of them demolishing viability of certain specs
[1:17:46] krome2dadome: long as they get done

[1:18:48] zachgamegodx: @buttbutterson just 1 got hurt super bad
[1:19:04] vibesham: im just tired of the fact that its always rogues
[1:19:39] anmusallam: hello mesman how are you sir
[1:19:41] zachgamegodx: the 10% evis nerf? wasn’t that bad
[1:20:01] vibesham: 10% evis nerf was nothing
[1:20:16] vibesham: was a joke from blizzard
[1:20:21] zachgamegodx: always rogues what then?
[1:20:21] buttbutterson: pre rogue rework wasn’t terrible, their dmg profile reflected the cc they had, now though
[1:20:37] vibesham: they're always the best meele
[1:21:02] zachgamegodx: argument is that dh is the best melee currently have been made
[1:21:07] zachgamegodx: I’m behind that argument
[1:21:09] vibesham: I hate the fact that they're never "bad" or not a part of the meta @zachgamegodx
[1:21:15] buttbutterson: the 170% movement speed infinite gouge cheap shot bullshit amounts of dmg is not ok
[1:21:23] vibesham: I just dont see that at all
[1:21:59] vibesham: sure dh is crazy right now, but rogues are always crazy
[1:21:59] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[1:22:24] zachgamegodx: historically yeah rogues are insanely high representation in tourny pkay
[1:23:10] vibesham: They're also highly represented if you play on the higher end of the ladder
[1:23:13] zachgamegodx: this patch tho, dh offers strong of healer and primary target control with double outlaws dmg potential
[1:25:01] zachgamegodx: outlaw has better cross cc slightly more primary target control, much better cross cc similar  healer cc
[1:25:48] vibesham: You're entitled to your opinion, i just disagree
[1:26:00] vibesham: I don't wanna sit here and discuss in a twitch chat. Too tired
[1:27:17] Anhak: rogue mage druids always kinda find a spot in almost every meta cause their cc is some of the best in the game
[1:27:26] zachgamegodx: kidney doesn’t cdr
[1:27:53] vibesham: 20 second cd, doesnt need cdr xD
[1:28:01] zachgamegodx: dh has similar levels of control on a single target, outlaw can cheap shot the whole team, which is why I said it
[1:28:12] Dwilk20: Looks like a fun exciting Lock lobby
[1:28:34] krome2dadome: @zachgamegodx the level of control is not comparable between the two
[1:29:18] karthos: aoe fear and detain also
[1:32:48] ButtaTWD: mr mes what’s good
[1:33:21] unbellv: dh balanced

[1:40:00] Anhak: u get like a level an hour in a good sm grp
[1:40:00] Begasaur: oh
[1:40:04] krome2dadome: it's like an hour a level
[1:40:04] Begasaur: 4 hours, maybe 3 levels?
[1:40:31] Begasaur: at 34 you can just farm armory over and over again

[1:43:27] Ristvakbaen1911: Sub just seems to have some crazy CC potential
[1:43:45] krome2dadome: it's still and unkillable melee with kidney shot
[1:43:53] Ristvakbaen1911: Is Duel taken frequently?
[1:44:08] Ristvakbaen1911: Ahhh makes sense
[1:44:08] sunileif: remove gouge from pvp
[1:44:36] sunileif: add a 2 sec stun for getting knocked out of stealth
[1:44:57] zachgamegodx: gouge has good coutner play already.. dots break it
[1:45:03] zachgamegodx: you need to be smart about who ur using it on
[1:45:06] Ristvakbaen1911: @sunileif That's called getting cheap shotted by the opposing rogue LUL
[1:45:31] zachgamegodx: not counter play exactly, but at least it's not infallable
[1:46:18] Ristvakbaen1911: What do you think DK needs to see more action?
[1:46:31] zachgamegodx: @sunileif just buffing dh

[1:52:40] sunileif: those dudes have trust funds
[1:52:48] krome2dadome: imagine

[2:05:20] swaggitto: @supatease who was the new guy btw? he did a great job fitting in with you guys
[2:05:27] Drathimos: @supatease thats how the meta results in when classes are very homogenized. all that matters is picking whatever is overtuned and not the synergies involved between classes
[2:06:10] Aisssey: why’d they add lythi in? thought he did great, remember him from the past, just curious.
[2:06:22] ButtaTWD: the meta should be fdk only :D
[2:06:25] ButtaTWD: jkjk
[2:07:12] KoiOrigin: you think hunter will have a solid place in phase 2?
[2:07:14] Mortifiedwow: I actually felt like he was over the top emotionally invested and felt off but maybe cause I'm not used to him casting.
[2:07:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've heard Venruki say that the weakauras mean that players make fewer mistakes, and that makes it less exciting. I think that's true sometimes
[2:07:38] Majinbrew: melee hunter and spriest are top dps on warcraft logs
[2:07:51] Majinbrew: so yeah hunter is in a good spot for sure
[2:08:14] nrdoubleu: shadowlands season 1 was amazing both pve/pvp
[2:08:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Even with the weakauras we saw an observer basically kill someone today in AWC
[2:08:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh damn, I didn't know placement like that could happen
[2:09:06] Rainbowmes: rip hardcore

[2:16:20] krome2dadome: brings a new meaning to "that's a hunter wep"
[2:16:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: I have heard mention of "SODcore" some kind of hardcore SOD idea, but I can't see it catching on
[2:16:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the runes make it easier
[2:17:05] nikthevoker: ya you just spam raptor
[2:18:14] Begasaur: idk if i can go back to non WF cat on classic
[2:19:39] Majinbrew: man im so torn on what to lvl between lock and rogue lol
[2:19:42] Majinbrew: can not decide
[2:19:57] Majinbrew: yeah thats true good point
[2:21:02] Bronloch: Mes what are TOP3 changes Blizz needs to make AWC?
[2:21:12] Majinbrew: maybe ill lvl lock 1st then to fund rogue more since they are more wep dependent
[2:21:23] sunileif: ner frogues
[2:21:27] sunileif: nerf rogues more
[2:21:36] sunileif: keep nerfign rogues
[2:22:19] sunileif: sub is top raid by like 15%
[2:23:07] theodeth: well their new data source is solo shuffle
[2:23:11] theodeth: which they didn't have in the past
[2:23:17] Anhak: i dont think its WA ppl in pvp have used them sicne cata just not turny players
[2:23:18] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[2:24:08] Anhak: they defo did in cata and mop
[2:24:27] Majinbrew: ppl used to laugh at losa users

[2:25:20] Anhak: who was even turny player
[2:25:40] Anhak: for a ton of stuff
[2:25:58] Anhak: wa were a thing in cata
[2:26:16] Anhak: they werent as understanded but they were a thing
[2:26:21] ripinpeace10: holy pala feels so underwhelming in SoD sacred shield does no healing/absorb and beacon of faith jjust ooms you :/ holy shock sucks too
[2:26:23] Anhak: the scripts themselves were not as figured out
[2:26:53] Anhak: yea which was similar to tracking
[2:27:02] Anhak: not exact same
[2:27:52] nikthevoker: dont bother
[2:28:05] rtcinema: Stopwatch the most useless built in feature at this point cause WAs exist?
[2:28:30] c0jaK: rested xp guide (taylor's version)
[2:28:49] rtcinema: I remember that was critical for tracking interrupts on LAN
[2:28:53] Anhak: @rtcinema i use sw a lot i use it as a timer for irl stuff etc in theory could u use a wa probably but /sw 180 is easy for a 3 min thing
[2:29:23] Anhak: id say ive used sw like 1-2 times a day
[2:29:25] rtcinema: I use / break 180 for that
[2:29:27] rtcinema: lol
[2:29:29] Anhak: is that less then wa yes but
[2:29:36] Anhak: which isnt a wa tho
[2:29:59] Anhak: and i have in the past used sw to track run times and stuff to know if ima hit instance cap etc
[2:29:59] rtcinema: But I guess SW is good if you arent tryingt o alert your group/raid for something

[3:06:06] enviscerate: im not afk i cant stun because everything is on dr
[3:06:18] nikthevoker: he said go pal
[3:07:07] dawsonator171: assa is such a liability.
[3:07:19] dawsonator171: defensively limited
[3:08:22] Anhak: Kermit: Congrats to the 3rd 40 in our guild.. BOP EL !
[3:08:27] americanmoses18: lol mes in with nik LOLOL COLLUSION
[3:08:54] bubblebuddyx_: this holy paladin is playing divne plea in solo shufflke
[3:08:57] bubblebuddyx_: nerfing his own heals
[3:08:57] americanmoses18: nik throwing per usual
[3:08:58] bubblebuddyx_: my eyes
[3:11:01] zachgamegodx: are u friends with ozz the shaman..theres a reason why im asking just wanna know the answer first
[3:11:30] americanmoses18: depends on wut ur gunna say...if its negative ill just time u out @zachgamegodx
[3:11:49] zachgamegodx: not negative, just a heads up
[3:12:01] americanmoses18: u may proceed
[3:12:02] zachgamegodx: wasnt sure if it was a friendly joke or something
[3:12:24] nikthevoker: actually so troll
[3:12:33] americanmoses18: i blame nik didnt do 200k dps
[3:15:43] nikthevoker: -350 for the night lets see what i can max out at
[3:16:33] nikthevoker: "afk" was general all he had to do was hit the healer, not the 2 DHs
[3:18:15] nikthevoker: everyone runnin 40 yards, is not the play
[3:18:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Double DH ouch
[3:18:50] serratedlove: even if the rogue gets bubbles, there's 2 darknesses until bop comes up etc
[3:19:00] nikthevoker: that was aggainst MW
[3:19:02] americanmoses18: i legit just run 10 chars to 1800 then stop doing solo shit tilts me too much @nikthevoker
[3:19:15] Old_Tomatoes: Holy shit did gnomer
[3:20:29] Old_Tomatoes: It was much more stimulating than bfd
[3:21:19] Old_Tomatoes: Yeah, I would say having a person capable of switching to a third heal is very useful
[3:21:49] Anhak: :)
[3:22:41] Old_Tomatoes: I think the devs got kinda of miffed at people one tanking and solo healing bfd and said lets crank that u[ a little
[3:23:31] Anhak: i also legit think most of us got use to 30 min clears and 2 min kill times and being GEARED
[3:23:33] rtcinema: I mean there aren't various difficulty levels.. so they basically have to tune everything on the easy side
[3:23:38] Anhak: and now were not GEARED
[3:24:01] Anhak: were not bis
[3:24:01] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:24:05] Anhak: like we were in bfd
[3:24:10] Old_Tomatoes: Eh
[3:24:14] Old_Tomatoes: Some SM gear is good
[3:24:15] rtcinema: BFD bis gear is better than most 5 man gear at 60
[3:24:15] nikthevoker: theres some
[3:24:17] nikthevoker: crafted
[3:24:20] nikthevoker: and quests
[3:24:23] rtcinema: Or at least close to it
[3:24:24] Anhak: there is a ton of useful stuff
[3:24:42] Old_Tomatoes: No one brought a slow LOL
[3:24:42] CaravelGaming: 2 gnomeregan bosses ONLY deal nature damage so nature pots completely deal with them
[3:24:42] tmigwans1: HAHAHA
[3:24:46] nikthevoker: casters got bunch of shit
[3:25:03] shopkeeperyt: clown rets
[3:25:04] Kappa_Boyz: lol
[3:25:13] Kappa_Boyz: bots
[3:25:23] Anhak: so trinket ranged stat stick helm boots and crafted gloves are all im using
[3:25:34] Old_Tomatoes: Idk if its just warriors but I did not expect tank hp to spike that much
[3:25:35] Anhak: AND THOSE BOOTS are only being used cause i dont have the other helmet
[3:25:46] Anhak: cause i have better boots but the 12 ap bonus
[3:26:00] Anhak: and trinket we wont replace at all
[3:26:10] Old_Tomatoes: The BFD str agi neck I think is still really good
[3:26:23] Anhak: yea its good for feral and decent for warriors
[3:26:42] Anhak: a chance at 40? how early you straming tmrw?
[3:26:56] reklebin: mage is so broken in sod lol 3 pulling armory cleared in 6 min haha
[3:27:03] nikthevoker: white bandit mask bis
[3:27:22] Anhak: i assumed normal raid time
[3:27:44] Anhak: so realisticly if u go hard tmrw u could quit now but that be pressing it and not farming any prebis
[3:27:54] Anhak: and we know that people are finding this one harder
[3:27:59] Anhak: so prebis is probably a really good idea
[3:28:05] Anhak: and runes etc
[3:28:08] nikthevoker: i mean you could go SM and be 40 in 1hr
[3:28:33] Anhak: na even in a 4 mage aoe pull grp it be more then 5 dungeon clears to 40
[3:28:33] Devcomz: People telling me BFD gear is mostly preraid bis is that not true?
[3:28:43] Old_Tomatoes: Not typically
[3:28:54] Anhak: @Devcomz its good but not preraid bis
[3:28:58] Old_Tomatoes: Weapons are easily beaten by higher level stuff
[3:29:10] nikthevoker: @Devcomz some not all, and depends on cass
[3:29:25] nikthevoker: except ferals
[3:29:34] Devcomz: And here I thought my rogue was getting off easy  being Full BFD gear outside of pvp event daggers and a one or two things
[3:29:34] nikthevoker: only 1 upgrade and its stv
[3:30:01] Anhak: well feral has wsg bracers rings and probably some of the tiger stuff that minmax is better
[3:30:37] Anhak: im missing 1 dagger right now and im thinking about dropping almost 50 gold to get the enchant
[3:31:21] nikthevoker: fml now i gget crusader and im forced to troll myself
[3:31:46] nikthevoker: its just funny
