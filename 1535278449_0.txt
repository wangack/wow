[0:29:10] abracka_: ion was just in another interview, said DF was in development before SL released. but i mean, that isn't the first time we heard something like that lol
[0:29:42] TheUnknowing: yeah they say that for every expac lol @abracka_
[0:29:52] Oswanov: I mean, yeah. That's not unusual
[0:30:14] Vetyst: Well no, but its been liek that for every expansion. they generally are already working on the story 2 expansions ahead. so patch 12.0 now. 11.0 has been written and the zones are being developed.
[0:30:41] Ston1ex: Yo whats going on here ResidentSleeper
[0:30:44] TheScandalized: Atleast this time they dont have 12 different systems to balance
[0:30:51] TheScandalized: which is proibly a large chunk of development time
[0:30:55] abracka_: they just need to actually listen to our feedback and not implement it later in the .1 and .2 patch cycle

[0:40:05] Zettabyte: Top of the mornin' to ya laddie, @Towelliee towHAMUP
[0:40:11] falldrgn: I like how they are doing this. Allows for more focused testing and not 1000000 bugs from a couple of zones
[0:40:19] ShadoodHD: could this mean more invites are coming towCopium
[0:40:22] legend449: i mean, wouldnt you rather have that though, so all players can test that zone specific and report any bugs?
[0:40:52] baaronthemonk: @Towelliee Morning Towelliee! You see all the new weapon models?
[0:41:02] NieIas: looks new

[0:42:55] SpicyFeta: Daddy is a name for babysitting other toons in the world wake up
[0:43:02] Coloran10: hi, have y tried assassination on a dungeon? trying to find a good gameplay on youtube but nothing yet
[0:43:16] kimmo_gaming: Help me Daddy because I have sinned LOL
[0:43:24] Rayao: Shoutout for my Priest homeboy "Daddy-Ravencrest" EU still playing his vanilla character :D
[0:43:28] RealMelorandor: Do you think Dragonflight is going to come out this year?
[0:43:30] Sionz: It seems like the cadence of testing seems to be more direct. I think that's a great idea
[0:43:34] WitchKing__Malekith: @Towelliee would you tell me a story before I go to bed if I paid you ? I want that deep voice whispering in my ear as I fall in the arms of Morpheus
[0:43:42] abracka_: @kimmo_gaming towStop towIt lmao
[0:43:49] Ensanee: @towelliee yeah, just curious how creators view the xpac so far, think it looks amazing so far.
[0:43:50] raye_gaming22: I mean Ion and Morgen said they moved awayfrom forcing players to log in everyday
[0:44:10] larrylegend36: morning dude, hope you have a great stream
[0:44:14] mr_tkd76: A few people are saying it's a legit game changer
[0:44:20] BfAleTitan: should be the next upgrade after epic riding
[0:44:24] Partizangaming: Dragon riding is the most pathetic thing of the expansion
[0:44:26] Chozx: @Towelliee I played classic till level 33 and i want to pick it up on wotlk ( i skipped tbc completely ) should i start over or keep the 33 mage and keep going?
[0:44:28] pupkat: @Towelliee no way it is going to happen... it is expansion feature only
[0:44:39] LycanKain: I don't see how you can compare that. One is a power, the other is just flying lol
[0:44:40] meroxzx: instead of running around circles in oribos you get to fly around the zones POG
[0:45:02] DecayedmiNt: Just make it something you learn
[0:45:06] BfAleTitan: is it a lot of time...consider the Drakthyr can use sore in all other zones?
[0:45:11] Vetyst: Ion commented on that by saying the animations might not support it
[0:45:28] KaisenSiru: Only dragons
[0:45:36] EpicBananners: he did say that. said forget about the graphics just add those later. like people wouldn't complain
[0:45:36] Bogzeh: nah just give it without animations, no work needed
[0:45:39] whatz_tv: how long ppl have been farming invincible for example..now its useless
[0:45:40] NoSkillNoCash: any dragon mount
[0:45:45] Snabido: Potential for mount upgrades, just a big work
[0:45:46] BoezIRL: draktir can do it everywhere in the world
[0:45:46] Ziddrax: or just increase the speed that flying mounts have beside dragonflight
[0:45:53] ShadoodHD: i mean guild wars 2 did it why not wow :^)
[0:45:58] Pallananana: i'm imagining mimiron's head stalling mid air
[0:46:00] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I mean there is a reason why its called Dragon riding, and not Mount riding
[0:46:01] Zettabyte: I want my OG Pinto horse mount to have dragonriding, @Towelliee towRee Kappa towCopium
[0:46:10] omnifreakfx: going back to regular flying is going to be torture lol
[0:46:13] Zarce: I hope they build on the system and later expand on it.
[0:46:21] dmarinn: dragon fly in good t testing for new ideas
[0:46:27] ShadoodHD: ... i'm going crazy today the only thing that can cure me is alpha or wrath towRee \
[0:46:33] NieIas: dont know how i feel about the tier sets yet..
[0:46:36] temp3st98: last time we had a refresh was mop 10 years ago
[0:46:44] BfAleTitan: i don't see them making anyone else able to be an evoker
[0:46:47] griffdog125: They will be asking for weapon lvling up again lol
[0:46:53] scenario17: headless horseman with dragon riding LUL
[0:46:54] BfAleTitan: but maybe Drakthyr Paladin
[0:47:07] rohdey: although how long did it take for DK's to be playable by any race? Kappa
[0:47:19] Chrizzor13: but its 3x times speed
[0:47:19] Molvonos: @griffdog125 I have the FoS for leveling weapons/bare knuckle, i'm good.
[0:47:25] larrylegend36: i think that ability is so sick
[0:47:29] ShadoodHD: who said bring back wep skill points WutFace
[0:47:35] Sionz: What are your thoughts on the new crafting?
[0:47:40] SadDingus: is it ok to be not be excited for dragonriding?
[0:47:53] baaronthemonk: love the priest
[0:47:55] TheRobWatling: @SadDingus It's okay to feel however you want.
[0:48:00] griffdog125: @molvonos lol same
[0:48:04] SadDingus: neat thnx
[0:48:07] BfAleTitan: @SadDingus  sure
[0:48:09] bricko89: DK still #1 tier so far
[0:48:12] jwt55: Hi. It’s me. God.
[0:48:13] baaronthemonk: wish they would have doe the cloth scraps as 3d
[0:48:14] NieIas: red will be mythic
[0:48:15] DecentAtBest_: Lock is dope too
[0:48:15] scenario17: shoulders are massive
[0:48:18] maskedboy999: finally a Priest tier coool with my tauren would be nice
[0:48:22] Flyer_753: Glow color probs gonna change for the tier
[0:48:31] Molvonos: @SadDingus Yep, perfectly fine.  Not everyone'll like everything.
[0:48:34] abracka_: not yet
[0:48:38] BfAleTitan: yea there is going to be a lot of movement on all these sets
[0:48:39] jwt55: Toweli is my main tank. Against satan.
[0:48:42] SadDingus: :)
[0:48:48] Zolshy89: how do you think dragon riding will play out in the long run? cool now but how about in the long run? I feel like they should add player races or something

[0:49:07] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Check out the Evoker tier gear
[0:49:08] DecentAtBest_: Hunter helm looks coolest for me
[0:49:11] Densetsu_: Concepts looks so much better so far imo
[0:49:16] Punk611: with this being early the color might not be correct. they changed the colors of the current tier before release.
[0:49:35] meroxzx: everyone look like shaman
[0:49:44] Ithylz: A shame they don't make broader dresses (especially at the bottom). Some NPCs already have that in their appearance
[0:49:45] DecayedmiNt: Most tanks are friends with Satan, we sold our souls long ago Kappa
[0:50:20] abracka_: mythic for sure
[0:50:24] raye_gaming22: is porb mythic
[0:50:26] raye_gaming22: yea
[0:50:27] NieIas: concept art is always better
[0:50:30] Molvonos: Red/Black is usually Mythic
[0:51:01] NieIas: those horns
[0:51:06] MarquisLek: excited to collect all the dragonriding cosmetics
[0:51:08] rbailey_2222: rbailey_2222 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 73 months! 
[0:51:13] tawil_at_umr: face goes to blank @Towelliee
[0:51:19] Punk611: they keep trying to make horns work for lock
[0:51:21] Balkep: pool noodles horns
[0:51:22] rohdey: purple set wins
[0:51:28] jamarky23: all these sets are 100 & a step up from SL imo
[0:51:45] Rakim88: helm like riders from lord of the rings
[0:51:46] The_Tacozilla: you can view some of the tier pieces in game if you go to appearances and search for raid
[0:51:50] NieIas: yea definitely better than the sofo ones
[0:52:12] shallowsqu1d: shallowsqu1d subscribed with Prime. 
[0:52:13] Lupusdeus: paladin set looks so average
[0:52:14] M0nkTV: i m a priest main but i dont like the shoulders on them dunno why the rest is okey
[0:52:23] M0nkTV: lock shoulders are better
[0:52:28] Molvonos: Prolly will.  Considering you got Night Fae Soulshapes from a few of the end bosses of Tier.
[0:52:44] Punk611: definitely not the bunny ears on current tier.
[0:52:45] jesuschristsupperstar: CONCEPTED
[0:52:46] RagingPunk: the reason its called concept art lol
[0:52:55] TheRobWatling: Concepts don't have any restrictions
[0:53:16] Fafnyir: @jesuschristsupperstar Right? LUL
[0:53:31] Solgryn: I think they can easily just make the racial abilities evoker abilities instead, since it has to do with tails/wings and give them different ones if they're too OP on other classes
[0:53:34] Snabido: On the hips there are 2, but its 1
[0:53:38] Valvax: no they mean the actual robe has layers in the concept
[0:53:39] Snabido: in mid
[0:53:43] Valvax: but in the actual its just painted
[0:53:44] BoezIRL: missed druid
[0:53:44] jamarky23: Shaman set looks lit af imo
[0:53:52] CommanderKrano: Evoker looks... not so nice imo, sadly :(
[0:53:59] JanPhilip: Why do they all look the same?
[0:54:11] tawil_at_umr: helm looks silly from front
[0:54:15] flebbooo: very druidic, good stuff
[0:54:17] Molvonos: It'll definitely look better on a non-human
[0:54:21] Nevindaz: but why the same colors..
[0:54:22] Bogzeh: evoker might look good with that armor in dragon form
[0:54:27] rohdey: 100%
[0:54:30] baaronthemonk: They don't all look the same. They are colored the same
[0:54:34] Nevindaz: look at the evoker one
[0:54:40] temp3st98: @Nevindaz because based on the raid
[0:54:41] Nevindaz: is so unque
[0:54:49] Punk611: woth druid you get a tree or an animal. at least it wasn't a tree.
[0:54:55] JanPhilip: @baaronthemonk compared to older tier sets these are VERY similar.
[0:55:09] Sollice: Morning
[0:55:18] Molvonos: Eyyy Sol
[0:55:18] Lupusdeus: paladins got shafted
[0:55:20] Sleepylol93: Shaman looks so goooood
[0:55:23] awesomekubbe: Thoughts on the DK set?
[0:55:26] Rayao: are they showing the evoker set on a Belf? :D why not on a dracthyr lol
[0:55:27] sliproach: All set ahve rocks druid you know what'll protect you more than stone? FEATHERS!
[0:55:42] enLilija: I like the druid set. Looks better than current one.
[0:55:44] KaisenSiru: Pog
[0:55:46] Nevindaz: evoker is the best one comp to others
[0:55:47] FrankTheTank1988: yeah most seems very much same to me altho they seem to be going for a very primal/elements kinda setup across all the sets. while cool its kinda lazy that they arent diversifying it more. :(
[0:55:47] DecentAtBest_: @towelliee one thing I would love to see in future wow is adjustments to models for different idle stances. Humans look so uptight in the way they stand for example
[0:55:48] Kaernunnos: its on a human nor drac, so will be weird
[0:55:50] cappei: I think this is the worst one. I hate it
[0:55:52] Nevindaz: wut? LUL
[0:55:54] Nevindaz: IS THE BEST
[0:56:00] szble: doesnt look good
[0:56:00] Flyer_753: Looks like you're wearing Deathwing's sking
[0:56:01] Oswanov: There is too little going on in the middle
[0:56:02] Jokervenom1978: I like it
[0:56:03] Flyer_753: skin*
[0:56:04] Molvonos: Supposedly this set changes with the Dracthyr form
[0:56:05] CommanderKrano: the concept art looks so awesome and then there is that... xD
[0:56:05] Bogzeh: there better be a dragon form version for that
[0:56:06] DoubleNova: looks like rogue
[0:56:09] Respls: reminds me of warrior dragon soul
[0:56:09] Solgryn: helm and shoulders 9/10 - rest is mediocre yes - gloves are good
[0:56:10] Nevindaz: i like it
[0:56:12] SadDingus: needs some heft to the pants to even out the outfit
[0:56:13] Punk611: I'm still confused if this will show on the dragon form or not?
[0:56:13] Curufin_: the sets all look the same xD
[0:56:15] Zettabyte: No full set andy ;)
[0:56:15] pumpsxc: IDK that looks kinda scuffed
[0:56:16] AshEvilDead66: looks like Deathwing
[0:56:17] Scoodles91: head and sholders should apear on the dragon form, rest is not
[0:56:17] mrniceguy817: That looks like a valorant weapon
[0:56:18] watchSkye: Kinda reminds me of the Dragon Soul Warrior Set, at least the shoulders.
[0:56:18] Smithii: Weird that the only flame below the shoulders are in the groin :D
[0:56:20] TheUnknowing: looks like rogue or dh
[0:56:21] LycanKain: Might look better in action, rather than a still image honestly
[0:56:25] Sleepylol93: I feel they focus on shaman style more cuz that mf looks so good
[0:56:26] SadDingus: very top heavy
[0:56:26] larrylegend36: front ok, but gonna look so weird from our playing angel in the back
[0:56:28] captiv8: looks better than the rest
[0:56:29] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: there is a statement saying there maybe a dragoon form also
[0:56:30] kimmo_gaming: Yeah its a rogue hunter mix
[0:56:31] jhajden: shoulders and head would probably look good with older shaman pieces
[0:56:33] tawil_at_umr: is there dragonform pic? @Towelliee
[0:56:36] AshEvilDead66: looks too much like deathwing
[0:56:38] poleon17: it looks like the effect is cut off at the shoulders
[0:56:38] relaption: feels like a lot of the sets so far skipped leg day
[0:56:39] Solgryn: especially from the back it looks so bad
[0:56:42] NieIas: completely different set LUL
[0:56:42] Sollice: The boots
[0:56:44] Nevindaz: the horns
[0:56:45] Kaernunnos: theres been a vocal shaman push for a tank spec for a long time...
[0:56:45] Rabiahtaro132: Not enough scales, too much leather.
[0:56:46] Solgryn: virgin version vs. chad
[0:56:48] TheUnknowing: didnt nail it at all
[0:56:53] Molvonos: @Towelliee The 'good' pieces are what end up visible on the Dracthyr form.
[0:56:54] szble: supposed to be like lava armor but looks like elather
[0:56:57] BfAleTitan: the concept might be closer to the set when in drakthyr form
[0:56:57] temp3st98: no spikes on the legs
[0:56:59] flebbooo: yeah that don't look finished at all  KEKW
[0:56:59] Brodih_: and not knee pads
[0:57:00] Bogzeh: chad cosplay
[0:57:02] larrylegend36: boots are fire asf
[0:57:03] Brodih_: no*
[0:57:03] bigoldmeatpie: that also might be the LFR/normal/HC version and the concept is the mythic
[0:57:06] Nicoz971: Concept art is better, same for shadowlands set, concept was way better
[0:57:08] warcraftnewsnetwork: that's true for all though
[0:57:10] sliproach: @Solgryn whipped vision
[0:57:10] Boltex: back looks so empty
[0:57:12] Maytan26: bloodelf body type is bad
[0:57:12] M0nkTV: look at the wrists
[0:57:17] sinlesssinner: looks a lot like the concept art for Zereth Mortis/Sepulcher sets..
[0:57:17] Ithylz: That's mainly because its textured aka flat
[0:57:21] Ithylz: Compared to concept
[0:57:22] Sleepylol93: I feel they focus more on Shaman style cuz that mf looks awesome
[0:57:23] watchSkye: That's the "original versus what we've got at home" kinda thing.
[0:57:23] AshEvilDead66: its deathwing armor for sure
[0:57:27] jhajden: looks like ant man
[0:57:32] abracka_: LOL
[0:57:34] Snabido: You mean Wish? LUL
[0:57:35] Solgryn: oatLOL
[0:57:37] nvnto: strapped to the front only KEKW
[0:57:44] Brodih_: and over sized
[0:57:45] flebbooo: It looks as  if the shoulderpads are just pasted onto the front side KEKW
[0:57:45] kapiteinplus1: fake deadpool costume
[0:57:45] kimmo_gaming: Evoker onesie LOL
[0:57:46] smoothmelodies: They’ve been in the game for so long to be messing up tiers. They know what we want
[0:57:46] enigmasvea: its not done tho
[0:57:50] Buckwink: pretty sure I wore this as a kid lol
[0:57:51] br3z: its like the mythic BoD sets, they all look great for the mythic sets. then you get to mail and it looks half done, nothing really changes between all versions of it
[0:57:52] ShadoodHD: thank god for cloaks KEKW
[0:57:53] woiafys: cant see towliee in the dark lulw
[0:57:58] Tamz_tv: more like the wish.com version
[0:58:01] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Boosti661 (warning)
[0:58:11] Solgryn: It's like there was no concept art from the back so they didn't know what to do and made it generic
[0:58:11] Sleepylol93: feel they focus more on Shaman style cuz that mf looks awesome  <3
[0:58:12] maagnusz1: Wanna kiss?
[0:58:15] maskedboy999: this Is a rog that stealed evokers head and shoulder
[0:58:18] Nicoz971: @Towelliee Blizzard is listening to feedback for hunter talent tree, I hope you will advocate for us paladin and yell at blizzard it smth sucks KEKW
[0:58:24] Boltex: no
[0:58:24] Sollice: Warlock looked good
[0:58:24] Azrael1828: ned flanders "feels like im wearing nothing at all"
[0:58:31] sinlesssinner: you dont see armor on the Dracthyr
[0:58:33] Buckwink: they said most of it right?
[0:58:36] Kale_Nd: didn't they say that it will work in dragon form ?
[0:58:37] sinlesssinner: you see it in visage form
[0:58:39] Sleepylol93: The armor dosent show on the drake itself that sad...only the human
[0:58:41] NieIas: i have zero hype for dracthyr and this definitely doesnt win me over
[0:58:46] warcraftnewsnetwork: can you preview it in game?
[0:58:59] szble: it should show on the dracthyr model
[0:59:16] Zarce: @sinlesssinner Yeah good point, why do they have a "look" when you don't see the armor?
[0:59:16] KaisenSiru: Dragon Soul
[0:59:37] SpenceSir: I like the set to be honest
[0:59:42] br3z: i think only belts and some shoulders show on dracthyr atm
[0:59:52] Nevindaz: 7
[0:59:53] Solgryn: They said in an interview for tier sets they can do different things since only the dracthyr can wear them
[1:00:00] pumpsxc: generous
[1:00:04] Rabiahtaro132: It might be something that looks cooler in Dracrthyr form.
[1:00:06] Fyeah: warlock tier is gigachad :(
[1:00:07] Molvonos: I feel like it's unfinished for the time being since it's class based.
[1:00:20] bigoldmeatpie: quest weapon models are actually really good
[1:00:27] jwt55: Towellie, advice on professions?
[1:00:30] Sleepylol93: They look like that barber spinning thing
[1:00:35] majorpipoo: i like simple stuff ! its great
[1:00:38] TheUnknowing: questing gear typically boring so understandable
[1:00:41] NieIas: very basic models
[1:00:59] OviTheGray: couple of the daggers are pretty nice
[1:01:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: druid form dont show armor so dracthyr not showing armor is not a huge issue to me
[1:01:31] maagnusz1: I’m going to play a Tauren Evoker
[1:01:35] tatqo: Hello Towelle hi chat thijsWave thijsWave

[1:03:53] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Will we get another PTR update?
[1:04:08] br3z: i hope we get too many 2h weapons that are the size of 1 handers again
[1:04:08] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[1:04:21] LegoCoin: imagine if these are not the actual weapons and they just leak  unencrypted random things now to trick us
[1:04:37] bigoldmeatpie: isn't the dracthyr starting zone also a max level zone though?
[1:05:25] Tamz_tv: those models need more polygons
[1:05:31] jwt55: King Varian Wrynn on his burner account again.
[1:06:16] Infebdo: Probably zone based
[1:07:11] Kale_Nd: The Dracthyr zone area is the top right zone
[1:07:24] LegoCoin: that dagger has kind of a hook at end of blade it could get stuck if you stabbed to deep
[1:07:29] raye_gaming22: they said that we non dragons revisit the zone
[1:07:30] Bogzeh: just because its on the map doesnt mean its a max lvl zone lol
[1:07:31] Joelyboyy: like DH and the broken shore
[1:07:35] Rayao: might be kinda like the DK starting zone, in the corner of easters plaguelands
[1:07:39] lumaday: hilt

[1:10:40] NieIas: hope we get some world content info soon. we know so little about it
[1:10:41] nvnto: they said they want more focussed testing this time, right?

[1:19:57] jasonbriggs: @MalachiCuevas bfa
[1:20:21] Volatilestyle: legion raids are easy
[1:20:25] Ezekyler: STANDAR 2H SWORD
[1:20:26] Sleepylol93: We need berserk style weapons, BIG MAN
[1:20:29] Ezekyler: oops
[1:20:32] roodenburgertje: I like the questing more then dungeon gear
[1:20:34] bigoldmeatpie: dungeon weapons
[1:20:35] fewyn: fewyn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months, currently on a 33 month streak! towHAMUP
[1:20:36] br3z: they got dungeon weapons
[1:20:45] MirroredZephyr: Legion raids are already soloable - would need to see BFA raids later on
[1:20:47] roodenburgertje: dungeon weapons look horrible imo
[1:21:02] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Is Crendor back playing WoW?
[1:21:12] Wolfenhoof: so did we 20 years ago BibleThump
[1:21:28] KaisenSiru: 2022 Pog
[1:21:43] Infebdo: they say that every expansion tho "it was in development before X was released"
[1:21:45] Milanesa_De_Pollo: That's what they do with all expansions, they start development before the previous one is released
[1:21:45] DecayedmiNt: Something they dont say but was always kinda figured
[1:21:47] mackieeswe: nov 2022
[1:22:00] Alaquane: towPog december towCopium
[1:22:06] Elff11: 2 days before LUL
[1:22:12] Kaernunnos: maybe thats why they ignored SL feedback...
[1:22:12] BlewGamingGroup: they knew in advance that shadowlands was going to be shitty
[1:22:18] Wolfenhoof: Baine was sitting around in oribos for 1,5 years for this i suppose, its better be good.
[1:22:20] NieIas: first alpha build has been very stable and art is done already
[1:22:32] 1Unselectable: At least pronouns and body types will be a thing now. Glad that leak came through. I'm gonna be a they/them body type 2 dragonkin.
[1:22:37] falldrgn: Imean I know they do that, its a small team, concept art\story etc..and they shift people around as needed
[1:22:39] kibarashi: they actually said in teh interviews, WOD and Legion was done at the same time, could have gone eitehr way.
[1:22:51] Kaernunnos: i dunno, i quit before 9.1, just start paying attn again today
[1:23:02] Dathas487: Well said
[1:23:04] jwt55: See you in THE World of Warcraft Senior Towellie. 👻
[1:23:09] Megadisaster24: They listened to feedback when the number dwindle hard after the FFXIV exodus
[1:23:12] KingSlayerYotam: They only needed to communicate better,keeping people in the dark only lead to bad speculation
[1:23:24] kibarashi: correct
[1:23:38] DecayedmiNt: It was B team
[1:24:55] szble: sad
[1:25:00] vaxian_0528: PunOko
[1:25:17] Wolfenhoof: I would have took the Gnolls about the Drag-thyr any time.
[1:25:25] szble: it should be
[1:25:25] chambiann: YES PLEASE
[1:25:25] BlewGamingGroup: gathering skills need to be since everyone runs 2 primary skills if they are raiders
[1:25:26] Pritamin: dream on
[1:25:26] Fafnyir: All gathering included
[1:25:39] VyNKaSMyN_: !cam
[1:25:39] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Like New World it felt cool to craft everything and also gather
[1:25:51] Sleepylol93: Would be also nice if you can have 2big 2 small profs or more
[1:25:55] Nevindaz: towCopium
[1:26:12] szble: bots farm half the mats anyway
[1:26:21] chambiann: if not give us all gatherings, atleast give us the one that matches fx engineering (mining) kinda like enchanting already has the matching one build in
[1:26:24] enLilija: It would be cool if gathering profs were secondary and they if you have a crafting prof that needs certain resources you get bonuses to the gathering them.
[1:26:27] Hypertitan: would that kinda f the economy a little tho?  Probably won't be that bad but that might be something they're concerened about
[1:26:30] mewkittymon: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[1:26:33] Merkuriuz: yes
[1:26:35] Hypertitan: concerned*
[1:26:39] Milanesa_De_Pollo: They can go the Rift route and allow you to buy more professions slots in the store LUL
[1:26:45] Furinax: No
[1:26:48] svu3: like WoD garrison mines?>
[1:26:50] Flyer_753: @Hypertitan WoW has no economy
[1:26:56] Wolfenhoof: @cptainbian bots and multiboxes i would assume at around 55-60% as well
[1:26:56] Malarick: exactly like New World.  nice to let us have choice without forcing is into 2
[1:27:01] BlewGamingGroup: it would drive the prices down to be honest
[1:27:06] enLilija: For now I just need to make alts just to be gatherers. And like in the Lost Ark it's fun you can gather everything you need.
[1:27:12] medanmarko: The impact on the economy would be... interesting. If all people had gathering, that would make resources abundant and end products cheaper.
[1:27:30] watchSkye: I could see them give a player 2 main professions + 1 secondary profession like mining, but not all, please don't.
[1:27:31] Jokervenom1978: F
[1:27:32] Alaquane: f
[1:27:36] Sionz: ESO HAS THE BEST ANTIQUITY SYSTEM
[1:27:37] sakura_2020: f
[1:27:37] scarlls: F
[1:27:37] gdtomii: Archeology just needs a complete overhaul
[1:27:40] ShadoodHD: F
[1:27:44] BoezIRL: towF
[1:27:46] thommy_blank: isnt it viable to have 2 gathering profession with all the new systems in place ?
[1:27:47] Engrim: f
[1:27:48] 91Niki: The bots are already ruining the economy for gathering mats. Can’t be ruined more than it is already LUL
[1:27:48] flebbooo: F, def a missed opportunity for an xpac about dragons
[1:27:48] roodenburgertje: archeology fits so much in the dragonflight theme IMO
[1:27:49] Honvar: Indeed I love that profession
[1:27:50] Hypertitan: right.  I think it would be cool, but economy is a huge concern for MMO's.  I would imagine they're hesitant on anything that has the POSSIBILITY to f things up
[1:27:51] Sleepylol93: I like the way Ashes of creation are doing the profs tbh, think it would work in wow too
[1:27:51] mewkittymon: F
[1:27:52] svu3: for Zihn Rohk?
[1:27:57] szble: or eso scrying
[1:28:02] DecentAtBest_: @towelliee would be cool if you could do all the gathering, but then specialise in one depending on primary which gives a boost to that gathering. IE blacksmith gets boost to mining etc
[1:28:07] TombStoneMercenary: Maxed it in wrath than noped out after cata....
[1:28:07] Kriven: Lost Arkology?
[1:28:08] LawnSpeaker: minecraft
[1:28:12] LegoCoin: new framework so keeping it
[1:28:21] Sleepylol93: Or ashes of creation style with the profs
[1:28:25] Naturalbeef: You would think it would be very important in the ancient land of the Dragon Isles
[1:28:37] LawnSpeaker: @TombStoneMercenary maxed archaeology in wrath?
[1:28:42] MOLAR305: Shadowlands archeology could have been amazing
[1:29:02] dragothicx: what do they mean by Siege of Org skip?
[1:29:04] NieIas: finally

[1:29:06] scarlls: Pog
[1:29:06] FrankTizzle: professions need RNG; its been static since WoW began
[1:29:08] TombStoneMercenary: @LawnSpeaker Cata long day LOL
[1:29:12] flebbooo: SoO and DS skips? POGGERS
[1:29:13] lumaday: lfg
[1:29:17] Streamcrush: that's ten years in the making lol
[1:29:17] Hypertitan: @91Niki I mean you're not wrong haha.  I just think that's something that they're concerned about
[1:29:18] ShadoodHD: wait they want talent tree to expandable? sounds interesting
[1:29:18] Mojohusk: Lifebinde zZzz.
[1:29:22] Molvonos: Dude on reddit posted a pick of Garrosh dropping TWO pair of shoulders for him on one go.
[1:29:24] Molvonos: People were salty
[1:29:41] kimmo_gaming: All the legacy raids deserve a skip as many of the last bosses have mounts\
[1:29:59] eximisprime: they need to make skipping to any boss in older content available
[1:30:08] Hypertitan: I don't farm siege specifically because there's no skip
[1:30:19] Snabido: @dragothicx You have to clear it from start to finish, having a skip would shorten time spent
[1:30:27] 91Niki: @hypertitan if Blizzards manages to control the amount of bots farming herbs and ore, the prices of those mats will be just fine, even if they are cross realm on AH. Right now the issue is bots putting those mats up for massive undercut with like 12k-30k units.
[1:30:27] szble: Smorc
[1:30:32] LegoCoin: ear LUL
[1:30:33] KaisenSiru: Pog
[1:30:53] Solgryn: More selfie patches oatPog
[1:30:54] Sleepylol93: 3 bugs per week  LUL
[1:30:57] szble: battlepass coming Pog
[1:30:58] Streamcrush: more bite sized stuff in between mega patches, probably
[1:31:02] Streamcrush: like Vanilla
[1:31:02] SpoofAvatar: 10.125
[1:31:02] Ithylz: Smaller? X.X.5 are already small
[1:31:02] LawnSpeaker: @TombStoneMercenary lol >.< archaeology in wrath would have been dangerous
[1:31:03] Alaquane: every 4 weeks like FF14 towPog
[1:31:05] flebbooo: 10.0.9 WAYTOODANK
[1:31:05] valarbravoosi: smaller raid tiers like Pandaria?
[1:31:08] Megadisaster24: 3.3.3
[1:31:08] BlewGamingGroup: every other week
[1:31:09] Ellycat1: I hope the raid tiers themselves dont get cut into smaller raids.
[1:31:10] yaashs: Smaller as in ¨No raid¨ patch?
[1:31:12] Megadisaster24: 3.3.4
[1:31:21] maxkule: Legion had a patch every 11 weeks
[1:31:24] BoezIRL: 3.3.5a
[1:31:25] flebbooo: oh yeah 4.0a LUL
[1:31:32] zybbae: Patch 10.0.7 - Lightning McDragon  Grand Prix
[1:31:33] NieIas: mop 5.4.8
[1:31:33] sliproach: but most of them were to buff or nerf classes
[1:31:34] onybear: There was a patch every Tuesday during vanilla…
[1:31:39] DecentAtBest_: I miss the days of 2 boss raids. That give fun opportunity to change things up
[1:31:41] Hypertitan: @91Niki absolutely....I wish they were much more active on fighting the bots for sure.
[1:31:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: 3.1415
[1:31:47] LegoCoin: yeah we call them weekly builds in the dev world
[1:31:57] TombStoneMercenary: Its to much math when they have to ass letters to the damn numbers!
[1:31:58] MarquisLek: just imagine all the jailer raid nerfs as a patch each
[1:31:58] nightwolf_87: mini patch
[1:32:00] LegoCoin: RC, Monthly, Weekly
[1:32:02] ShadoodHD: might as well bring back weekly maintenance LUL
[1:32:05] TombStoneMercenary: add
[1:32:13] sinlesssinner: what they need to do is make the raid skips account wide... having ur alt have the skip and ur alts not... is shitty :'( @Towelliee
[1:32:24] Dathas487: Patches on a 6 month cadence would be fine honestly
[1:32:37] zybbae: Legion patch cycle would be fantastic though
[1:32:41] 91Niki: @hypertitan yeah me too… it’s honestly a somewhat easy thing to battle. Using the heat map method they used in New World. I’m amazed they haven’t struck down harder already.
[1:32:47] sliproach: not complaining would prefer them to fix thing during a patch rather than the we will fix it next patch
[1:32:49] br3z: wtb some more heritage armor between raid tiers
[1:32:54] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Every 10 weeks its a .5 patch, and every 20 is a big patch, kinda
[1:33:04] Layliah79: All legacy content should be account wide IMO
[1:33:29] Hypertitan: @91Niki doesn't help that they got rid of a lot of their CS team.
[1:33:45] 91Niki: @hypertitan that too lol
[1:33:46] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee .5 patch can have a mini raid with 2-3 bosses maybe
[1:33:55] Alaquane: sacrifice one alt, have that alt extend lockout
[1:33:59] szble: maybe not raid but dungeons at least maybe bg/arenas
[1:33:59] Ithylz: They can speed up raids if they speed up gear acquisition and make them 8 bosses overall
[1:34:00] BoezIRL: they should enable skips for older raid when a new expansion starts
[1:34:04] Maskeraid3r: Mini Boss!
[1:34:05] papakrajci: man i just hopped in here
[1:34:15] flebbooo: I'm feeling a ToV mini raid coming
[1:34:15] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[1:34:21] Xsilentghost: I dont think my Guild can get CE in 4 months though @Towelliee need like 5 months but maybe DF raids will be easier
[1:35:13] TheRiwen: stubit hard traids like last raid
[1:35:21] yaashs: They are gonna focus on the average raider, not top 1%
[1:35:26] Hypertitan: Mythic is still going to be challenging to your standard CE guild...they're just not actively tuning for RWF guilds
[1:35:29] BoezIRL: yeah no more raid wipe mechanics if 1 screw up
[1:35:31] DecentAtBest_: That’s why TOGc was so brilliant, low work on environment of a raid and focus on the bosses themselves. I would be stoked with wow changing to small upgrades each tier, and 3-5 boss raids.
[1:35:33] Hypertitan: that's how I understood it
[1:36:26] Speshulist: Need a Mythic, Hard-mode LUL   Does nothing but give you mythic gear and bragging rights
[1:36:30] LawnSpeaker: Why not just make a special version for rwf
[1:36:33] George2001k: Am I the only one who will miss the mission table?
[1:36:46] TheRiwen: I hope they will focus on the casuls not the 1%
[1:36:59] Gargantix: where is the dragon isles on the map?
[1:37:06] QuesoFM: @George2001k ya still got 3 of em lol
[1:37:06] Talason: towelliee how much gold you going into dragonflight with?
[1:37:09] George2001k: All we need to test is Dragonflying and talents…
[1:37:11] Hypertitan: I feel like an 8 or 9 day RWF is perfect as far as a viewing experience goes.  After that I get bored
[1:37:37] ArcaneMaki: Man I miss Ulduar where you could change difficulty on the spot.
[1:37:48] ShadoodHD: i wish they can do that in dragonflight, especially with how much time it takes to kill a boss in a single fight
[1:38:09] reggiepowa: @hypertitan if it's over a week it needs to be at leas 9-10 days imo so that the reset times don't play a major role
[1:38:10] BarthelemeusNL: what do you hope for the 500 mount achiev? what recoler would be worth 500 mounts
[1:38:16] smashwow: oooooorrr.... hear me out.... don't tune it for max ilvl?
[1:38:18] EpicBananners: KEKW i have 250k
[1:38:33] falldrgn: Well Method\ Echo are the 0.00001%  its crazy. But th ey can't have a repeat of last tier

[1:38:45] TheRiwen: 280 mounts i wll never get 500
[1:38:45] Nevindaz: yep
[1:38:53] smashwow: yeah but 3 weeks to a month was harmful not helplful
[1:38:55] papakrajci: most definetly
[1:38:57] robert_332: 195 mounts haha
[1:38:58] Talason: kappa
[1:39:05] Gargantix: i've played WoW for over 14 years, literally never watched a race to world first
[1:39:06] Talason: no i have 2.2 mill
[1:39:16] smashwow: whatever they did to sotfo tuning less than that
[1:39:18] rhsiuol: only having 8 bosses will make it faster
[1:39:30] George2001k: For this expansion I will do mythic plus and professions on like 4 characters.
[1:39:35] Talason: Talason subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! hammers up!
[1:39:37] 3v3r35t_: Will Blizzard ever make an in house event for RWF ?
[1:39:39] George2001k: That’s good enough for me
[1:39:39] Speshulist: allow people to take off a week or 2 max at work and it's 10/10.  Any more than that, and people are returning to their lives
[1:39:43] LawnSpeaker: isn't it impossible to tune it that perfectly?
[1:39:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: i like the idea of a steady power increase each week in the raid to help out
[1:39:46] DecentAtBest_: Why not frequent 3-5 boss raids?
[1:39:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: like icc
[1:39:56] rhsiuol: inb4 another emerald nightmare
[1:40:03] mintcookie_vajankle: Wish they would just make a RTWF on a separate realm like Tournaments, tune to whatever the 0.01 whack jobs difficulty want and let everyone else chill on live
[1:40:16] Ithylz: Nathria was 8 days with 10 bosses so DF 1st raid could be a bit harder with only 8 bosses. 10-12 days seems to be the "right spot"
[1:40:37] rhsiuol: insane m+ utility
[1:40:40] Molvonos: The fact there's a talent means they're not racials, they're overglorified class skills
[1:40:41] Kale_Nd: They should make it share a cooldown
[1:40:44] Dathas487: Do druid's?
[1:40:46] Alaquane: slap those racials on the same cooldown
[1:40:47] maxkule: @Towelliee What do you think the odds are that they open Dracthyr up to other classes?
[1:40:51] Dathas487: Ursol's and typhoon?
[1:40:51] MindhackerTV: u have monk
[1:40:52] robert_332: nope
[1:40:53] Solgryn: right idk why they're not just evoker abilities
[1:40:53] Malarick: op in pvp much?
[1:40:54] gdtomii: Kul tiran has 1
[1:40:59] Eggz1004: panda monk - racial + monk ability
[1:41:00] zybbae: TBF racials for Drachtyr is part of their kit as Evokers
[1:41:00] Scoodles91: goblins have to racials but they share CD
[1:41:01] MindhackerTV: leg sweep and ring
[1:41:03] BoezIRL: consider them more like a class ability
[1:41:09] robert_332: druids?
[1:41:10] larrylegend36: no, and theyre both relatively low CDs
[1:41:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: their passive racials sound good
[1:41:17] gdtomii: nope
[1:41:18] Molvonos: Class
[1:41:20] gdtomii: class ability
[1:41:20] Wigzkilla: no
[1:41:21] Windnecro: Its designed to just be a class instead of racials at the moment, probably wont change until / if more classes get added
[1:41:22] sliproach: no
[1:41:26] larrylegend36: plus they have a kick on healer spec, gonna be so OP
[1:41:28] Windnecro: otherwise why are racials on the talent tree
[1:41:32] Kloshx: but they dont have any dps stat i mean.... no blood fury or berserker rage
[1:41:33] Ithylz: It's the combo
[1:41:34] Eggz1004: panda has a racial stun i think
[1:41:35] zybbae: the lines between class and race is blurred in the case of Dracthyr
[1:41:37] Mehlwyrm: since they just can be evoker isnt it also a class ability?
[1:41:43] Ithylz: That's why they have this
[1:41:44] Angsterz: they have no stun
[1:41:47] tryxbunneh03: CC master 2.0
[1:41:51] captiv8: how many does a rogue have?
[1:41:51] flebbooo: oh the pvp is gonna be something KEKW
[1:41:57] KaisenSiru: They will probably share a CD like Goblin Jump/Rocket
[1:41:57] Lenzoface: class and race is kind of no diffrence in this case though, as only drakthyr can be evoker
[1:42:01] szble: 1 stun and a roar that increases cc duration by 50 percent
[1:42:02] Speshulist: @Mehlwyrm i agree
[1:42:02] Velashen: If they can never be another class it really doesn’t matter. It’s balance for one class
[1:42:03] larrylegend36: yeah its like, insane
[1:42:06] MindhackerTV: I think they are building it to be a support hero class
[1:42:07] positive_ions: so many keybinds
[1:42:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: diablo 4 just popped up on playstation store to wishlist
[1:42:15] larrylegend36: 3 of them are under 45s CD too
[1:42:16] Angsterz: they have the sleep walk
[1:42:16] captiv8: also stuns have diminishing returns, i don't think its as big a deal as you think it is
[1:42:18] Qoax: Won’t matter because of dr
[1:42:22] thommy_blank: how do dracthyr racials work in BGs ?
[1:42:31] 91Niki: @Towelliee Not racial, but Taurens as druids has a ton of stuns. My feral has 3 stuns, a knock back and a root.
[1:42:43] Angsterz: soar doesnt work in instances
[1:42:48] zybbae: but ye their kit is 100% getting adjusted
[1:42:48] szble: they're knd of squishy though
[1:42:49] paravak: They're currently a race and class combined, so no real difference between a tauren monk with stomp and leg sweep
[1:42:50] Alaquane: out of combat party heal in visage form
[1:42:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: did you see their passive skills?
[1:42:59] clambynature: You mean lizard people?
[1:43:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: racials
[1:43:25] Hypertitan: just by watching, I feel that they're clunky a bit
[1:43:26] QuesoFM: hover

[1:43:38] Windnecro: @Towelliee at the moment its not balanced as a race, just a class. Its why racials are on the talent tree which isnt true for any other class either. If / when more classes are added to the race it will likely get changed then

[1:46:27] maxkule: She who will not be named.
[1:46:27] temp3st98: thats why people hate on dragonflight = no sylvanas. People are coomers
[1:46:28] Cezzan: The blade shape looks awkward
[1:46:32] Hypertitan: just pop in to show her and it leads to zero other things
[1:46:35] papakrajci: For being a wow vet and been playing since launch, I've tried my best to bring my friends into the game. people either stay or go. do you think this dlc will change it?

[1:48:26] UlsterFarl: Good old Type 4
[1:48:28] Marenel1: Just wanna bring it out to some people here asking if the expansion will be good... Blizzard has lost its touch and maybe microsoft might bring it around but dont keep hoping and expecting a nostalgic feeling u had 10 years ago in WoW.. It will only torment you everytime a new x-pac comes out or a huge patch. The sooner you accept this the less you get hurt by it.

[2:27:44] BoezIRL: good for leveling
[2:27:48] leoy_reira: I played WoW many years and dropped when bfa came out juste having a sneak peek for the fun of it right now. Is this expansion not a bit underwhelming or weird for you guys ? It feels like it to me
[2:27:49] MarwenSD: Apparations could be decent
[2:27:52] Wrex36: do a voidform-less build
[2:27:54] oakenzz: remember that silence is also your interupt right?
[2:28:07] Icycone: Yeah it heals you and You get mana I think
[2:28:21] Bluguieghe: are they doing some druid changes?
[2:28:30] Daarksyde: apparation spec the way to gooooo
[2:28:30] Cakeabsorber: PogChamp
[2:28:32] backstreetalright: Just the talent trees are so intricate and complex its borderline oprional
[2:28:56] Wrex36: if you do SA commit to it later, if not go crit focus on the right and full voidform
[2:28:57] MarwenSD: well MF is a filler
[2:28:57] Ponickz: new
[2:29:02] whitehounds: it's new

[2:30:09] Nicoz971: nah bm hunter is the best for me
[2:30:10] Cakeabsorber: Looks like it branches out nicelty
[2:30:26] BoezIRL: did you see bm?
[2:30:27] Daarksyde: it allows changes for different mobs and encounters
[2:30:32] SeckSymbols: Except for Sanguine Teachings, bad talent points there
[2:30:42] Ponickz: seems ike the defensives are on the sides
[2:30:46] whitehounds: it's on live
[2:30:48] Daarksyde: do not take
[2:30:49] Alfredqt: But thats bad tho
[2:30:50] zeitgeiz: Spriest is actually one that has been received pretty negatively by the spriest community. Strong call for fixing it

[2:30:57] made4valhalla: a channel?
[2:30:59] made4valhalla: isnt it?

[2:31:18] Steelsky_: It's not bad, it's simply outclassed by Searing Nightmare
[2:31:19] gdtomii: @ProgettazioneInferni POGGERS KEKW
[2:31:19] Alfredqt: nah. the aoe damage isnt worth it tho
[2:31:20] Nicoz971: it's good on the talent tree, cause it's just 2 point
[2:31:21] DarkviperTV: Did you do hunter already
[2:31:22] MarwenSD: if you multi dot vampiric touch and mind blast a target it hits the others
[2:31:24] Ponickz: its pvp talent thats bad
[2:31:25] Hu33ard: only bad on live cause of what you give up
[2:31:28] whitehounds: if you have multiple vampiric touch on like 3 targets, the mindblast hits all of them @Towelliee
[2:31:30] Wrex36: spriest is ineligant but always has been for better or worse. they don't know what they want to do with it
[2:31:38] oakenzz: think so yeah
[2:31:40] Kali_shiv: It’s good on pantheon
[2:31:42] Seerated: Yep, think so

[2:32:50] PadidinJones: lmao @Towelliee you should macro that to shout SUDOKU when used
[2:32:51] CanadianCataclysm: Druids beware... Looks like Envoker racials might beat out what the druid flight form can do....

[2:32:56] Daarksyde: go into other talents
[2:32:59] BeardoBandito: definitely hungering void

[2:33:42] oakenzz: still really good
[2:33:47] Alaquane: seems convenient
[2:33:56] JellyBeansEU: it's a normal talent not pvp it's a great one for multi dot
[2:34:05] PadidinJones: Thats nice!
[2:34:16] Ponickz: venth conduit
[2:34:49] Steelsky_: You can start from the middle bottom one once you unlock i too
[2:34:52] Nicoz971: tallent is not finish cause this way you cant go down middle row KEKW
[2:34:54] JohnLeMay: wait is this the new talent point tree?

[2:34:59] Nicoz971: @Steelsky_ oh really
[2:34:59] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[2:38:49] Kali_shiv: Maybe dispersion
[2:39:00] kiljoy102: @Towelliee shadow priest discord has been lementing how bad the tree is. Unfurling darkness and mind bombs are skips in general dispersion is way better
[2:39:01] elyviontv: @Towelliee what transmog?
[2:39:04] odawgxd: Left is aoe dot
[2:39:06] Steelsky_: the issue is that Spriest aoe is still super busy, kinda lame when other specs can spam a couple buttons
[2:39:10] MysticRaven_: i hope they change that

[2:40:18] elyviontv: @Towelliee what tmog?
[2:40:22] Crazyblue21: Is it the head tmog he is talking about ?

[2:41:27] kiljoy102: the bottom of the tree is hot garbage
[2:41:35] druidhex: its too easy to break shields
[2:41:51] kiljoy102: shadow word death is on CD now. and it pops shields
[2:41:53] Reapercussionz: I hope they dont nerf destro into the ground for this exp
[2:41:55] shoota1982: the bottom tree is fine except for that shield talent
[2:42:02] Exoduc: Critical strikes from 1 ability have 10% chance to make apparations? Sounds like a rare occurance

[3:06:42] zgag: Ion just trolled Towelliee
[3:06:51] Rottencoarse: can we check the renown person @Towelliee ?
[3:07:00] literally_human_garbage: flight paths should be account bound
[3:07:02] vulkankragon: never trust an undead priest
[3:07:04] Mecabeast: SL mission tables were bad ez gold and augment runes
[3:07:08] ChrisarN: where is the new main hub in Dragonflight?
[3:07:13] Nicoz971: Covenant renown ?
[3:07:14] Snabido: 127, is where you stand
[3:07:15] Mecabeast: werent*
[3:07:15] Snabido: LUL
[3:07:17] moa285: monkaS Renown
[3:07:18] strike879: Mythic raiders will want mission table even if they dont use it. Table is best way of getting augment runes.
[3:07:18] Balkep: a very detailed report on renown Kappa
[3:07:19] generaljosh721: Didn’t you used to get teleported out when you got here?
[3:07:21] thunder993: LUL
[3:07:22] DeanoTV: account wide renown thank god man Kreygasm
[3:07:23] love_eggplant: oh nooooooooo
[3:07:23] Clotic_: atm it fetches from covenant from shadowlands
[3:07:33] DeanoTV: its account wide chat and replacing rep
[3:07:34] Hupu_a: easier to implement
[3:07:35] vulraneforot: monkaS Renown
[3:07:37] mohi7o: Im good with renown, as long as its not weekly locked
[3:07:38] flebbooo: Renown 1 Pog
[3:07:39] Heero_Effect: Battle pass !
[3:07:39] Boraal: @strike879 imagine them coming up with a better way to get runes, like crafting
[3:07:48] Exoduc: They say in interview renown is alot more satisfying feeling to it rather than farming rep to exalted
[3:07:50] pavepawns: renown isnt an issue so its fine
[3:07:57] flebbooo: i think Renown at is core a good idea
[3:07:57] ForSeriousNow: whats the difference between renown and rep anyway?
[3:08:00] Moose_Ka: that's pretty cool
[3:08:00] mieko29: Issnt renown just replacing reputation bar?
[3:08:03] Tmem99: Account wide?
[3:08:04] thunder993: and cosmetic only
[3:08:09] PrimalRain: Kissaweeb yeah
[3:08:13] DeanoTV: yea its account wide
[3:08:14] Sore1: isnt renown just a different form of rep o.o
[3:08:15] ChrisarN: @towelliee Do you know where the new main hub is in Dragonflight?
[3:08:16] DeanoTV: so its fine
[3:08:17] GreatWhiteDav: renown is just rep that sparkles and makes noises more often lol
[3:08:17] Moose_Ka: and that means you can unlock mounts and transmog from each reknown at once
[3:08:20] alexter93: for me the renow system is better than reputation, you can put in vendor that requires 25 of renow to buy X items
[3:08:20] Moose_Ka: that's sick
[3:08:31] generaljosh721: It gives people the option which renown they want to progress on any given day right?
[3:08:35] Hypertitan: whoa....what's this?  just got back
[3:08:38] joshehtv: as long as i dont have to drop my renown every time i want to play the game slightly differently
[3:08:38] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:08:43] Not_Protub: Isn't renown replacing only major reps ? Like all reps won't be renown I believe
[3:08:47] Velashen: Yeah that is content.
[3:09:00] ceranac23: dan is mr gm
[3:09:00] Exoduc: @Hypertitan glitched into valdrakken main capitol

[3:11:51] mohi7o: @ChrisarN You can only go to the main city, if you do a glitch with the portal to it and unlock the flightpath
[3:12:02] strike879: is renown getting anything usefull not like current rep where the gear reward is a downgrade by the time you hit exalted

[3:15:06] The_Tacozilla: some of the NPCs have dragon eyes and it does look kinda freaky, especially on panda
[3:15:07] Heero_Effect: Does playing alpha and beta burn you out from playing release version of expansion?
[3:15:10] RiptoreCA: This is the last zone in the game atm?
[3:15:14] Megadisaster24: Khadgar dies this expansion, I'm calling it
[3:15:19] Afhein: @Hypertitan They've said maybe in a later patch
[3:15:33] Angxlic: @Hypertitan "Archeology may be updated in later patches in Dragonflight, and they're hoping to find a new framework for the profession going forward."
[3:15:36] Miertez: reminds me more of shadowmoon valley and alliance garrison than surammar to be honest

[3:17:36] Gurrtug: They added new zone on alpha?
[3:17:39] Hypertitan: @protuberancegluante kind of an incentive to use it
[3:17:47] khazroi: What has changed for priests other than taking away our toolkit and giving it back as a talent tree?
[3:17:51] Boraal: is shadow form affecting that?

[3:19:21] Armdel: this rooms is definitely finished
[3:19:22] Balkep: they do cuts for dragons after all

[3:36:09] ZonnyArk: 25 yard range is kinda awkward
[3:36:13] paprickan: have you tried DK?
[3:36:29] Korupcija_: 10.4
[3:36:32] Krelivane_: Bro flying regularly will take forever to get around ANY of the Dragonflight zones hahahaha
[3:36:32] oxidexd: why would you want to regular fly?
[3:36:34] Exoduc: Wish they would do the reverse and allow dragon riding in normal zones
[3:36:35] Zarce: How was the DK btw?
[3:36:36] MirroredZephyr: who's going to want to regular fly ?
[3:36:36] oxidexd: it's just slower
[3:36:38] PvtHudson093: So max those reputations out chat
[3:36:40] TurboedTV: moving at 310 speed vs like 900 with dragon riding will feel terrible LUL

[3:36:44] Dwaggle: i hope we dont see 80% of classes being drakthyr

[3:37:03] temp3st98: people are lazy
[3:37:06] PrillaGorilla: Druid bots
[3:37:07] CommanderKrano: i like how the visage goes in two ways. if you are in dragonform and moutn up you stay in human form just for the riding, but if you are in humanform starting combat you just turn into a dragon for the fight and then back to human after the combat ends :D
[3:37:09] Luxicake: right? people get made with no flying now people gonna be mad with being forced to fly this way LUL
[3:37:09] ZetYokai: no way anyone can complain about flying at the start of expac
[3:37:10] gravlaxxx: dragon riding between mining nodes would be painful?
[3:37:13] chaostheory8907: @dwaggle They can only be evoker
[3:37:16] Rayao: if you know you gotta go up alot, you might wanna fly on a regular mount, you gonna fly down you use fragon riding

[3:37:18] Addy_life: wait can you dragonfly in other zones?
[3:37:18] Brehmus: Titan statue in the city?
[3:37:19] LastYouSaw: It feels great
[3:37:20] SpookBoio: i feel like this should be the 'normal' flying and flight paths should be the 'afk' way of flying
[3:37:20] mohi7o: Normal flying is brain turn off, thats why people like it
[3:37:21] flebbooo: People will always find ways to move around faster, i remmeber avaina's feather and shit
[3:37:24] HaloS23: @Towelliee So for being "The Dragon Isles" do you feel there are dragons there? like i see the background and would have expected to see dragons flying everywhere like the birds in old world wow.
[3:37:28] Gingerprimer: @Addy_life nope
[3:37:28] CrerisRs: you can point your mount and press auto walk and go afk completely tho, even if it takes 2x longer to get somewhere

[3:58:32] akia03: but if they like default ui from now why would they want this ui than?
[3:58:33] Krelivane_: Removing ElvUI for default in Dragonflight, can't wait
[3:58:36] executeart: I am deffault ui guy lmao, don't like installing 3rd party shit
[3:58:38] Rudric_Ice: let's say if blizzard bans add-ons what you gonna do then ? :)
[3:58:44] Joefoshow15: yeah that would help for sure
[3:58:48] Sollice: @Rudric_Ice They wont
[3:58:49] babadookz1251: I only have 1 addon and it’s John cena
[3:58:50] thebakeriscomingforu: i like minimal addons
[3:58:54] solsaver12: lol
[3:58:55] ZonnyArk: bans addons OMEGALUL
[3:58:56] j_bar111: Can you export default ui profiles to people to import? @Towelliee
[3:58:57] zellyree: They will never ban addons
[3:58:59] PrimalRain: that'll never happen
[3:59:00] rosina_scarlett: @Rudric_Ice they never will
[3:59:03] procyon_mfc: Work Orders will be in major cities.  Crafting tables mostly in the main dragon city but you can also pop up one away from the city
[3:59:04] Dwaggle: its to far past the point of no return to remove addonss
[3:59:05] Boraal: I'd lose my shit if Blizzard banned weak auras, I'd laugh.  Not that it'll happen.
[3:59:05] Youredoneson666: @j_bar111 yes you can
[3:59:07] Ribastur0075: cast bar looks so dope
[3:59:08] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Why would you go to major cities anyway, just that city is amazing and it has AH, you dont have to go to Org anymore
[3:59:12] TheRealDeo_: no shot they ban add-ons
[3:59:14] Zarce: Towellie is like one of those Flat-earthers just for addons LuL
[3:59:15] Arizath: Is there an option to use classic nameplates?
[3:59:19] Wolfenhoof: I would love them to ban auction house addons. But don't touch my altoholic.
[3:59:28] zinbers: Never say never

[3:59:51] RocketMan23: blizz ban addons after 17+ years? what are people smoking
[3:59:52] rosina_scarlett: @zinbers it's been 18 years.. they WON'T ban addons xD
[3:59:55] GroovyBryan: I like the new UI. I'm an addon whore too, but it will be nice to cut back on a few
[3:59:59] JBoshr: i really dislike the new cast bars, are they able to be reverted to the old style?
[4:00:10] AusterePanic: wow was designed for addons from the beginning, its one of the features people look for
[4:00:11] scenario17: @RocketMan23 blizz loves addons, it keeps people invested in the game
[4:00:12] Joefoshow15: good I dont wanna be reliant on mind flay lol
[4:00:15] savobm: hi Towelliee. The Lendarys are off?

[4:00:42] shutyourface: is that the octopus thing?
[4:00:46] shutyourface: if so yes i saw one
[4:00:49] thebakeriscomingforu: Blizz would have to rethink a lot of content if they banned addons. To do that they'd need to add several major updates beyond what we've seen.
[4:00:51] Krelivane_: Seeing Valdrakken makes me excited for the potential of a Stormwind and Orgrimmar revamp in the future
[4:00:56] zinbers: They have no choice since ff14 has quitely been gaining ground
[4:00:58] barnanimal: @Towelliee can you confirm that all priests have access to Flash Heal?

[4:01:27] Armdel: odds are something will be moved around anyway
[4:01:27] nerf________: but you never use mind flay and mind sear with so many procs
[4:01:32] Dwaggle: @barnanimal  i think so. its on his bottom bar
[4:01:45] rosina_scarlett: @zinbers over 80% of the playbase uses addons. they would be stupid to ban them
[4:01:47] chrslp: BLESS YOU LULA
[4:01:51] Zarce: cohhBless
[4:01:55] CaptainAlkohol: unlucky that we have 5 talents that buff mindflay :)
[4:01:59] RowanWeir: yeah, i think the tendrils are only really going to be a thing with searing nightmare situations

[4:05:39] zovru: dead player inc
[4:05:42] Cezzan: @Vinodlaren I think this one is the howling fjord music but im not sure

[4:06:33] lsachillies13: I don't like the health bars the rest looks dope with new UI
[4:06:34] Gingerprimer: Ban WAs lul
[4:06:40] Hu33ard: @Rudric_Ice game would be less fun if he did
[4:06:42] thymos_: @Rudric_Ice good idea
[4:06:49] Cezzan: Round 2
[4:06:53] DaWutz: ye, NO RAID ADDONS ANYMORE would be great. Poeple acutally would need to think and act on it again
[4:06:53] xReadyAimMissx: mans like, "round 2 mother trucker danMalding "
[4:06:58] thymos_: also ban them in pvp
[4:07:11] thymos_: :) 👍

[4:08:28] ggilgamech: yep
[4:08:33] thymos_: yes, obviously. MingLee
[4:08:36] zinbers: I not saying ban all addon it just for raid and the addon that make things super easy should be banned just keep the ui only the rest of them need to go autionhouse and all

[4:09:04] Mantistr: @Vinodlaren  you can check on youtube Adrian von Ziegler , he is awesome musician , celtic music and more
[4:09:05] backstreetalright: I’ve been mia from wow for a while (deep talk) but now i see the path
[4:09:09] zinbers: Anything that make it easy for you to play the game
[4:09:26] Rudric_Ice: @rosina_scarlett  that doesn't mean it's good for the game
[4:09:28] Gingerprimer: Also fighst would be way less interesting IMO
[4:09:36] thymos_: ban it in mythic weSmart
[4:09:39] Hu33ard: @Rudric_Ice I really enjoy the add on side of raiding and the customisation you get for yourself + your raid.. if they banned them then either the fights would become v easy/dull or there would be less bosses per raid which would mean less to do in game etc
[4:09:40] lucky_18990: where r u
[4:09:41] zinbers: Postal and baggy are good but the rest need to go
[4:10:07] shrektard69: where is mr streamer
[4:10:08] backstreetalright: I’ve been mia in the fantasy vibe department but now i see the path forward
[4:10:26] Gingerprimer: Postal and baggy can go and instead we keep raid WAs
[4:10:34] Rudric_Ice: I'm all for UI add-ons and everything else but not the raid ones
[4:10:44] pringlez91: Cant believe Just an Alpha of Dragonflight is taking the MMO world by storm, imagine this is finally released, it will be king again

[4:14:17] Cezzan: Sounds good ngl
[4:14:19] ggilgamech: hopefully they make the music good for it.. heroic music would not fit this zone
[4:14:23] Rudric_Ice: @hu33ard  it doesn't have to be easy you will just have to figure out the mechanics without the help of an add-on and you will spend more time on a boss
[4:14:27] Roenoake: @Towelliee Im getting my first chance since starting WoW to be my guilds Tank come Dragonflight
[4:14:27] zellyree: world quest / daylis prob later on to

[4:14:42] TheeLazyDuck: how is shadow priest handling with the new talent trees?
[4:15:01] emznev: @Roenoake goodluck with that^^
[4:15:04] Youredoneson666: this is also the first iteration of the alpha, i doubt the exp is set to what it'll be at launch
[4:15:05] centcentcent: when's your next arclight rumble stream lol
[4:15:06] Youredoneson666: who knows tho
[4:15:11] ggilgamech: that's why the riding is 950% speed
[4:15:19] Hu33ard: @Rudric_Ice But then once it has been done once each guild leader will just have a sheet they read off which is way more annoying than just having timers on your screen
[4:15:24] EKS90_: @Cezzan Ion also said this with crendor "They're also designed to bring back a sense of exploration of a world lived in - trying to move away from certain previous zones where it felt like everything in them existed strictly for gameplay purposes."  So they are trying to not do full everything purpose zones anymore
[4:15:27] nerf________: you have a talent that makes your dots proc ghosts on the left

[4:18:32] Korupcija_: wait, you can just change talents anywhere out of combat?
[4:18:34] Gapplebees1: Go Damnation
[4:18:40] Zsmith1995: Oh nice, they redid talents. Looks promising
[4:18:44] RowanWeir: i think thats more of a max level thing
[4:18:44] OviTheGray: dont u get more points at max level?
[4:18:44] Gapplebees1: Damnation is so good
[4:18:45] banditrox12: are you planning on uploading videos for each class?
[4:18:50] lucktight: @Towelliee have you ever tried the ascension classless wow private server, its actually amazing literally CLASSIC+
[4:18:57] Rudric_Ice: @hu33ard  there always be a downside to it  hey people keep saying WoW doesn't make you socialize anymore maybe that will now
[4:19:02] Aquadriel: damnation is pvp yes
[4:19:09] gallywyx4721: 20 years and still no beta or alpha haha
[4:19:15] Aquadriel: if you have misery, no need for damnation really
[4:19:18] Deathbite_: how is feral in DF
[4:19:19] backstreetalright: Do you have to pay to respec?
[4:19:22] Gapplebees1: Yes on live it's a pvp talent, in DF you'll take it
[4:19:36] thymos_: @groknarian just hook up with one of blizz's staff
[4:19:37] LeDerpski: I think damnation will be good in PvE in DF. I am looking forward to seeing if a spirit build works. I hate searing nightmare spam.
[4:19:49] Blastz_99: it was pvp in sl coz u had to choose mindbender but now its fine
[4:19:55] Gapplebees1: ^^^^

[4:20:18] nerf________: ah sadge
[4:20:23] log_in2: there is a talent calculator and you can save the linkks btw
[4:20:30] Aquadriel: I hate this tree cause a lot of shadow apparition stuff is on one side, and Idol of yog is on the other.. so you can't build properly for it lol
[4:20:36] cptrogers123: came back from work and i see my guy is streaming towF towF towF
[4:20:50] afirebugg: @Aquadriel yah i tried to make it work XD
[4:20:52] nerf________: this is super bad that idol of yogg is on the right but ghosts on the left
[4:20:56] backstreetalright: Wouldn’t it be cool if every class had a class dragon mount
[4:21:07] SebasDaMann: this tomato and onion sandwich is bussin

[4:21:23] thymos_: no burger DansGame
[4:21:24] CYNIC308: its always been best in WOW to go straight to the bottom of the tree then fill out the extras later
[4:21:26] Aquadriel: afirebugg i think one or 2 apparition talents should be further up rather than at the bottom, so you can mess around with it
[4:21:34] Joefoshow15: Joefoshow15 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Love the alpha content...I have hope for WoW

[4:22:20] thymos_: RP POGGERS
[4:22:20] orestes____: Just play WotLK :)
[4:22:21] xReadyAimMissx: "who eats veggies for breakfast" I hear while eating part of a veggie platter chevWEIRD lmao
[4:22:24] Gunlove: duel in IF , oh wait.
[4:22:29] EllisTheMenace1: is there a video of the major scity?
[4:22:30] Qoccy: if this will be shit. just go ashes
[4:22:42] raye_gaming22: we get a mage tower youill have content lvling and gearing all your chars
[4:22:49] goofywizard: @Towelliee Are you hopeful for this expansion or do you slightly feel like it would be like shadowlands?
[4:22:55] Zanzarful: @Qoccy ashes wont be out before the expansion after this is out
[4:22:56] Zanzarful: and then some
[4:22:58] Zanzarful: KEKW
[4:23:01] averyv123: R the usual talent changing restrictions going to apply ?

[4:24:02] xReadyAimMissx: lmao debbie downer LUL
[4:24:02] Foxfire7732: Dragonstyle bear form from a new dragonstyle mage tower :o
[4:24:09] D4rkycz: what about Proving Grounds?
[4:24:10] nerf________: oh your shadow form doesnt make your mount shadowy
[4:24:11] Qoccy: Is there any story telling bind to dragonriding? i didnt check anything out yet
[4:24:15] Snabido: Someone get the man a barrel of cope
[4:24:23] Metket: @Towelliee did you see where is tracking on the minimap?
[4:24:24] JimKappa420: gentelman club Kappa
[4:24:33] Gapplebees1: Torghast should have been mage tower 2.0, they ruined it when they tied it to legendary crafting, making it mandatory and dumbed down.
[4:24:36] Blastz_99: there is a glyph
[4:24:38] Spookyghostx: need the glyph
[4:24:40] GlueChugger: You can glyph it
[4:24:41] Jeilynmr: PokPikachu
[4:24:43] afirebugg: ^
[4:24:45] kibarashi: you need a gl\yph for that
[4:24:46] Scousebtw: Its a Glyph
[4:24:46] FatherHorus: its a glyph
[4:24:47] 0Rivan0: its a glyph
[4:24:51] OviTheGray: its a glyph
[4:24:52] ReinholdtRanger: Its a glyph
[4:24:54] Tarryble: glyph
[4:24:56] gmh00: @towelliee Searing Nightmare is the worst AoE in the game
[4:25:07] Snabido: It's a glyph? 😏
[4:25:07] smashwow: but is it a glyph?
[4:25:08] fantomas_the_rogue: I think it's a glyph guys Kappa
[4:25:10] ghost186_: Why cant they do something ground breaking like flight PVP? Seems like such a simple idea that could be a ton of fun.
[4:25:10] Blastz_99: shadowy friends i think
[4:25:11] Metket: track humanoids etc etc
[4:25:19] krounnen: Nesingwary arrived at your hub
[4:25:22] the_dunkfather: I have been MIA in WoW for so long
[4:25:24] LeDerpski: Middle 3rd row
[4:25:24] Akermay: There is normally a tracking button on the minimap, its missing?
[4:25:43] Gapplebees1: Searing nightmare is for like 7-8+ targets, Misery is better for smaller pulls
[4:25:43] Jack_the_Dipper: To bed they are not bringing the old dragon models back like we had in vanilla and WoTtLK
[4:25:44] Metket: @Akermay yeah where is tracking
[4:25:47] LeDerpski: I hate searing nightmare it feels so bad currently
[4:25:47] Jack_the_Dipper: bad*
[4:25:56] duskieeee: the problem with SN is its neccessary to compete in aoe but its the most unfun ability
[4:26:05] SchmidiGames: @Gearhead_ Searing Nightmare wins at 3+ targets
[4:26:08] Snabido: @Jack_the_Dipper DansGame
[4:26:11] gmh00: It's so poorly designed
[4:26:25] gmh00: @schmidigames That's besides the point
[4:26:31] gmh00: It's shit to press
[4:26:31] SchmidiGames: Searing Nightmare is probably the worst ability ever
[4:26:44] Nokterian: Boomer Nesingwary
[4:26:50] The_Tacozilla: I wish Hemet gave you all the hunting quests at once, instead you have to get them at each of his stop off points
[4:26:52] Orthobullet: They need to address spriest m+ aoe
[4:26:54] Cezzan: Am i the only spriest who likes searing nightmare? i dont love it but i dont mind it either
[4:26:56] gmh00: 3 gcds to do 1 instance of damage
[4:27:00] LeDerpski: If it spread VT also it might be okay
[4:27:00] Metket: is there any button to track at least? :D
[4:27:06] xReadyAimMissx: @the_dunkfather same, I just started playing again after many years of not playing at all. I'm having to re-learn the game before the expac requires me to re-learn how to play again. KEKWlaugh
[4:27:12] gmh00: @cezzan You're in the minority
[4:27:19] RiskyBusines_ez: if you didnt have to refresh Mind Sear every 3rd global, it would be "fine" . but the fact you have  to refresh mind sear so often make SN even shittier
[4:27:37] gmh00: @ Devs
[4:27:41] copterskates: you can do dracthyr routing though for speed leveling on retail release
[4:27:42] dracullus: not in Thursday?
[4:27:44] SchmidiGames: Cancelling Sear at any point during the channel just kills DPS it's so bad
[4:28:01] backstreetalright: Y man i just wish we had some drama on pvp and pve like the chests in classic
[4:28:03] gmh00: @schmidigames You kill Yailer yet?
[4:28:07] Eziak: Hoping for new talent trees also
[4:28:16] SchmidiGames: @MilkSupply0 ye
[4:28:19] SenseiLips: So ive been thinking or leveling something in shadowlands to try out dragonflight, would you recommend going horde or alliance or does it not matter anymore?
[4:28:21] thedarkaegis: Shadow Priest AOE is basically the biggest problem with the spec.  The talent tree is really top heavy with required talents.
[4:28:25] gmh00: Nice nice gz gz
[4:28:30] Karbonn: If they slowly added content as they finished it every couple weeks that would be cool imo.

[4:28:49] SenseiLips: @Towelliee So ive been thinking or leveling something in shadowlands to try out dragonflight, would you recommend going horde or alliance or does it not matter anymore?
[4:28:53] Eggz1004: im going to be letting the beginning hype die down a bit before I level my dracthyr
[4:28:56] The_Tacozilla: id like to see some more race / class combos unlock too
[4:28:58] ninedraft317: still trying to figure out what to main this expansion
[4:28:59] adambtwitchtv: man its so hot in the UK rn
[4:29:00] Wolfenhoof: @SenseiLips if you are unsure, the answer is always "play a tauren"
[4:29:13] abracka_: @Thestigg23 stay safe man
[4:29:15] the_dunkfather: @SenseiLips This
[4:29:21] Eziak: I think this is a good way to do it
[4:29:23] Joefoshow15: monk/DH will be very cool to see since they havent seen talent trees before
[4:29:26] ceranac23: they want focus testing
[4:29:26] Rabiahtaro132: you should save your evoker talents
[4:29:32] reklebin: @Towelliee can priests be orcs now?
[4:29:33] emznev: @Towelliee you still going to play wotlk beta LUL LUL
[4:29:34] jackymoon: all we are is dust in the wind man

[4:29:37] procyon_mfc: SMOrc Clap
[4:29:50] paravak: @Kemskemss Which blue post? Not questioning you just want to see it :)
[4:29:51] Zippaya: Is it me, or there is way more stuff they put on alpha, it seems like beta testing and almost ready to launch
[4:29:55] xeekae: When is beta dropping? @Towelliee
[4:29:56] Molvonos: It's like comparing Wagyu to beef you find in a dumpster behind a grocery store.  Why go Alliance? towSip
[4:29:59] garbagaha: unless you're australian down here everything is opposite and alliance dominate hahaha
[4:30:03] procyon_mfc: Anvil pet
[4:30:03] thymos_: @Thestigg23 just oppen the window 4Head
[4:30:18] the_dunkfather: You think we will get Buff Dragos or not lol
[4:30:30] Lulaboo: @Molvonos dude.

[4:30:55] adambtwitchtv: @Thestigg23 We have to keep the windows closed
[4:30:59] kingxjzeus: Everything about this expansion looks exciting so far
[4:30:59] Wolfenhoof: Why play anywhere where you can't play a tauren. It makes no sense.
[4:31:01] HindenbergZA: rip meatloaf
[4:31:10] Rabiahtaro132: I've been trying to convince my friends to go horde
[4:31:17] thymos_: @Thestigg23 then get an AC like a civil person Kappa
[4:31:20] kingxjzeus: I just made a dwarf for the first time, always played horde.  i actually enjoy it a lot.
[4:31:26] Divinedb: the one on the left is casting with his back :))
[4:31:27] ZarxIV: is the Alliance not viable any more?
[4:31:32] kingxjzeus: the dwarf racial is amazing
[4:31:34] adambtwitchtv: @Thymos_ BibleThump
[4:31:38] BubblePriest: Will there be a tank problem 3 months in, LFM TANK then G2G spam
[4:31:42] thymos_: @Thestigg23 KEKW
[4:31:46] xReadyAimMissx: @Thestigg23 drink lots of water gladdSIP it's the best you can do since y'all don't as many places with AC like in the states. It's been hot af here too. burkePain
[4:31:46] Epixil: will world first people be able to mix horde and alliance next raid?
[4:31:58] amricatt: I like playing Alliance but it depends on what you're doing.
[4:31:59] ScottxTee: This place looks bad ass
[4:32:15] mysteriousm4n: why tf is there not faction crossplay at this point in the game? World PVP doesn't even exist hardly, and majority of the time the factions are working together anyways. Just make them friends so that people can play whatever race they want
[4:32:21] the_hoff_man: @Towelliee do you think we will get any new allied races in Dragonflight?
[4:32:31] ZarxIV: @amricatt Like what
[4:32:42] LeDerpski: @mysteriousm4n there is?
[4:32:44] amricatt: @the_hoff_man They all ready said there wouldn't be.
[4:32:44] ChimmyNeutron: @mysteriousm4n There is crossplay now
[4:32:45] SchmidiGames: @Towelliee thing from beyond is bugged
[4:32:47] Snabido: @mysteriousm4n umad
[4:32:48] adambtwitchtv: @Thestigg23 yeah what makes it worse is our homes are all built to keep heat in
[4:32:49] SchmidiGames: It don't work
[4:32:50] ceranac23: @mysteriousm4n there is crossfaction play
[4:32:56] Korupcija_: are you farming volatile ice?
[4:32:59] toobaked1987: toobaked1987 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 3 years already. LETS GO!
[4:33:02] Orthobullet: The priest end talents dont work right atm
[4:33:06] duskieeee: its spawns based on casts not apparitions
[4:33:16] the_hoff_man: @amricatt oh, missed that info
[4:33:32] amricatt: @ZarxIV There's a lot of raids, mythics, etc. like that where alliance is not the best faction.  I'm not saying that you can't but it's more likely to do it on Horde.
[4:33:40] 0xnhil: did they fix the priest tree
[4:33:40] SonBaco: Does he use a mmo mouse?
[4:33:43] vagamingpanda: You can cast your mind blast proc during mindflay
[4:33:45] 0xnhil: right now its pretty shit
[4:33:46] toocheap2rhyme: anyone know if goblin gliders will be useful next expansion?
[4:33:49] amricatt: @the_hoff_man I just saw it on WoWhead this morning.  No worries.
[4:34:00] 0xnhil: shadow priest tree
[4:34:06] duskieeee: @nhil155 nope
[4:34:18] SchmidiGames: It's supposed to get stacks for every Apparition, but it only gains a stack each time you spawn an apparition @Towelliee
[4:34:20] LeDerpski: Its not that bad on paper lmao
[4:34:28] Gapplebees1: Needs a few things moved around but there are a lot of good talents
[4:34:29] 0xnhil: no, you need to go DEEP in the tree for any decent dps
[4:34:42] ZarxIV: @amricatt then Alliance is good for?
[4:34:48] 0xnhil: but then you get no utility or cds that help you
[4:34:48] thedarkaegis: You have to skip a ton of utility too
[4:34:50] SchmidiGames: The points deep in the tree are also generally kinda bad
[4:34:51] SchmidiGames: right now
[4:34:53] JimKappa420: can you move cast bar above your action bars? @towelliee
[4:34:59] duskieeee: and yet some of the bottom nodes are terrible, like a % of a % to get a apparition
[4:35:03] Orthobullet: They need to move around the end talents
[4:35:06] LeDerpski: The worse thing I see is having to sacrifice dps to get any defensives/silence
[4:35:08] Gapplebees1: THING FROM BEYONDDDDDDD
[4:35:08] Korupcija_: that is so pog
[4:35:19] Gapplebees1: LOL he does no damage
[4:35:22] Zansteh: no KEKW
[4:35:26] Molvonos: It's about 1200 a tick
[4:35:30] gmh00: You can give it PI
[4:35:36] Tripl3dot: can you summon nzoth?
[4:35:39] Gapplebees1: you do
[4:35:40] Ezekyler: Cosmetic talents IonJam
[4:35:41] m3rk_zion: Hey Towelliee, I hope you've been well. How's things feeling in the Alpha so far? I'm actually excited for DragonFlight.
[4:35:43] Gapplebees1: i saw it on your bender
[4:35:49] amricatt: @ZarxIV I don't do all that.  I like the change from years of playing Horde.  There's also different storylines in some expansions.
[4:35:49] gallywyx4721: @Towelliee have you played the war yet for df?
[4:35:54] BoezIRL: looked 600 per auto
[4:36:32] SchmidiGames: Void Apparitions is really, really bad
[4:36:38] Eggz1004: are you able to freely swap loadouts whenever or do you have to be in a rested area for that?

[4:37:08] propwash80: has anybody tried the ret pally in the alpha? how is the talent tree? how are they doing?
[4:37:20] zgag: Hunter pet
[4:37:22] SchmidiGames: It might look cool, but they literally need to multiply the numbers by 5 for it to have a noticable impact
[4:37:25] SenseiLips: so is normaly flying just gone
[4:37:25] Zansteh: dont think pally has a tree yet
[4:37:26] DoubleNova: did any class get major changes?
[4:37:30] m3rk_zion: Are they upping the level cap with this expansion?
[4:37:37] fantomas_the_rogue: hemet just never stops being bloodthirsty does he
[4:37:37] Gapplebees1: Omg am I going to get a mammoth pet in DF
[4:37:59] almey13: they need to make mobs harder to kill like back in the days
[4:38:17] Zayvion: Zayvion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[4:38:26] Zanzarful: @1alme1 go play classic for that one
[4:38:30] MasterNeff: How does dragon riding feel so far
[4:38:32] Gapplebees1: @1alme1 no way man. leveling shouldn't be challenging, it should be fun.
[4:38:34] dracullus: @Towelliee oh for you too, I saw news about mount for 2000 pets collected xD
[4:38:35] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad

[4:38:54] log_in2: mop mob difficulty was perfect
[4:38:57] zgag: Is it confirmed that new builds will be released every Tuesday.  Think Ion mentioned something along those lines

[4:39:08] DeanoTV: if u want that difficulty shit, go to classic KEKW
[4:39:10] manhooties: well they hard scaled it didnt they???
[4:39:15] watpuppy: they literally shit on it?
[4:39:16] PrimalRain: the community doesn't actually want harder anything, outside of a small minority
[4:39:20] shmokindoink: so blizzard added bartender ?
[4:39:25] sheriffsniffers: I'm so pumped for the UI overhaul
[4:39:28] NickLeonhearth: The total BS in legion was, the more ilvl you get, the more HP the mobs got, made it totally pointless to gear up
[4:39:33] Robodope: this game has plenty of challenging content in the endgame. leveling should get you hyped
[4:39:37] sethret: I don't even remember that at all
[4:39:39] Moose_Ka: Killing weenie mobs i nthe open world shouldnt be hard for the hero of the universe 5 times over
[4:39:44] Kriven: i mean it just made it more tedious
[4:40:02] thedarkaegis: Void apparitions is a chance to proc for a small damage increase.  Its too weak to be at the bottom of the tree.
[4:40:05] PokerFaceMoose: how do your normalize it too? person coming back after 3 years literally can't kill anything whole top tier raiders kill it all np?
[4:40:15] strike879: leveling is the tutorial of the new expansion nobody likes spending too long on a tutorial
[4:40:15] sheriffsniffers: the game has a gap in extreme casual to hard core
[4:40:16] Zippaya: at least elite need to be harder
[4:40:20] Maneguster: I think mobs that are specifically kill quests should be a bit tougher.
[4:40:20] Hyelander_: Leveling shouldn't be harder, because leveling isnt the end game of this game. if you want HARDER leveling, do it without a gear
[4:40:21] sheriffsniffers: cater to both but not the middle
[4:40:25] Alepouditsa: the are ppl tho that don't raid and do mythic
[4:40:29] loljehtii: @thedarkaegis the amount of apperations you get is crazy though, its pretty good
[4:40:35] Karbonn: In all honesty, people have less time now a days then they used to, so when stuff is made harder it takes more time and that can get frustrating to those with limited time.
[4:40:44] DoubleNova: are the charge up spells a gimmick?
[4:40:52] shmokindoink: yooo random but i just adopted a puppy! any helpful tips?
[4:40:57] kufodinas: Hi @Towelliee at what ms you play on this server?is there problems with high ms and dragon flying at 900% speed desyncs and staff?
[4:41:00] Karbonn: That being said, people with limited time to play most likely arent endgame raiding.
[4:41:01] ggilgamech: i mean your gear is not exactly going to be easy to get
[4:41:01] dracullus: there are always people that want to rewrite whole game cause they don't like it
[4:41:12] YSGMarquise: Why doesnt evoker have a tank spec?
[4:41:14] PrimalRain: Karbonn do they though? people live on netflix and shit lol
[4:41:19] Gapplebees1: There will be a lot of people who will be ilvl 250 trying to level in these zones btw. They can't make it too hard.
[4:41:29] YSGMarquise: Seems like a big beefy earth using dragon would be great at tanking
[4:41:34] Karbonn: @PrimalRain And that's the issue. There's more -things- that demand peoples time now.
[4:41:46] SenseiLips: i leveled one toon in the beginning and never logged back into shadowlands
[4:41:47] PrimalRain: Karbonn true there
[4:41:56] P4RT1CLEM4N: I fee like it took me way more than 10 hours to get thru the SL campaign the first time
[4:42:31] ggilgamech: it always been like that
[4:42:32] 0xnhil: why did they take all the detailed textures off all the dragon aspects
[4:42:34] dracullus: @Gearhead_ there will be people with 150 item level too, not everyone catch up gear for next expac or people just will go straight from 60 to DF
[4:42:35] Mikayyy: @SenseiLips thats so cool
[4:42:35] Zanzarful: @Gearhead_ It's probably gonna be balanced so a fresh boosted lvl 60 that you get with the pre order can easily lvl in the new zones
[4:42:38] PrimalRain: New gear while leveling is always exciting
[4:42:39] thedarkaegis: @LANDRIxo Without the talents to proc more MB procs you are limited in the numbers you can get.
[4:42:41] Eggz1004: there are people going to try going through here at like low 150s, 250 is setting the bar high
[4:42:42] OviTheGray: level with heirlooms :)
[4:43:00] 0xnhil: @Towelliee remember bfa when we hit 105?
[4:43:11] Torjix: @Towelliee will they add skip campaign (all) for alts?
[4:43:19] kranztheman: i never understood that. Why dont they start an expansion where the gear is better...
[4:43:23] SenseiLips: @Mikayyy i could care lessa bout ur response
[4:43:24] frenzoll: Boring Tumdra 😂
[4:43:28] vadermug: i dont think my main found an upgrade until lvl 55/56 on SL launch
[4:43:33] BoezIRL: like in cata when you went from 80 to 81?
[4:43:34] Korupcija_: he is retired
[4:43:38] Miguel85NYC: Thats why when a new expansion comes out, I put on all greens
[4:43:39] The_Tacozilla: he has several quests, when he goes to different areas
[4:43:46] PrimalRain: retired FeelsBadMan
[4:43:46] The_Tacozilla: each time he stops he gives a new quest
[4:43:47] kranztheman: Is it because the majority of casuals the gear WILL be better just not for those that completed end game raiding content?
[4:43:52] procyon_mfc: He'll Tom Brady it
[4:43:54] Gapplebees1: @Gearhead_ yeah, which is like 255 ilvl lol
[4:43:55] ChrisMFCook: was out of town for a few days, how is Alpha going? is it going to save WoW??????
[4:43:59] ggilgamech: Braum voice?
[4:43:59] The_Tacozilla: yea thats what i did
[4:44:04] Mr_RENG: @Towelliee how's the new ui feels like?
[4:44:12] OviTheGray: maybe is 1q / zone
[4:44:13] Zanzarful: @Gearhead_ ??? no its not
[4:44:13] BlewGamingGroup: most of the time when your top geared . you literally dont start upgrading gear til end game dungeons
[4:44:14] lecrabTV: skyrim cart Pog
[4:44:15] Mikayyy: @SenseiLips just saying i wish i was as cool as you
[4:44:17] The_Tacozilla: he just takes ages....
[4:44:39] Karbonn: They dont have all the UI changes in yet do that?
[4:44:43] KaptnG: New alpha build tomorrow or Thursday?
[4:44:43] Karbonn: they*
[4:44:44] Zanzarful: @Gearhead_ its much much lower than that, like maybe 140 or 150
[4:44:45] temp3st98: hemet is old
[4:44:47] vadermug: the edge from your gear paying off after the expansion is cool but it is a little sad not to get to use the cool new items
[4:44:50] ggilgamech: he wait for other players
[4:45:00] Thumper1024: is power infusion gone?
[4:45:01] dv_domino: Nessingwary is retired now, so of course he's slow
[4:45:09] Snabido: Isn't the quest achievement name also called boring
[4:45:12] Cezzan: @Thumper1024 no, its a talent now
[4:45:15] Robodope: have they said when they'll add the first dungeon for testing
[4:45:18] Respls: no i see it on his bar
[4:45:19] the_hoff_man: i always preferd howling fjord
[4:45:20] SenseiLips: the music tho
[4:45:27] smashwow: thought they killed nessingwary in BFA
[4:45:29] Gapplebees1: @Zanzarful Evokers start at 258 ilvl. Level 60 boost in DF will be around that.
[4:45:37] Thumper1024: only castable on self or other party members as well
[4:45:42] Flobosama: killing mobs in classic wasnt harder, it just took longer, which is just stupid, i do think it would be fun if certain mobs during leveling had mechanics
[4:45:44] pealladk: what gunnar have you on today
[4:45:47] smashwow: guess we brought him back with us Kappa
[4:45:56] Zanzarful: @Zanzarful If you use your pre order boost right now you most certainly do not get 250 ilvl
[4:45:57] Derion91: hope new classes coming in phase too#
[4:46:16] Gapplebees1: @Zanzarful we're talking about DF homie not SL
[4:46:19] ggilgamech: howling fjord,dragonblight to grizzly hills
[4:46:19] PvtHudson093: Please be paladin talents

[4:46:44] vadermug: cyclops gunnars lets go
[4:46:47] Bernardo994: i want Tony's glasses
[4:46:48] Thumper1024: @Cezzan do you know if PI is only self casted or can be casted on anyone like it is currently

[4:47:17] 0xnhil: @Towelliee speaking of leveling progression remember how horrible it felt to reach lvl 105 in bfa?
[4:47:17] Spathotan: Is this dumbass Hemet still forcing players to make every species extinct?

[4:48:39] Moose_Ka: I just have blue light reading glasses from warby parker. I work in tech and think they look better to wear in the office. Otherwise I would get gunnar

[5:13:05] Reckless_Monk: Hasan is the king.. thats all his content is.. LOL
[5:13:05] kiroslays: Why did they take it down?

[5:13:29] Cezzan: Plus zack respects you a lot
[5:13:30] Lawbelisk: From what we know of him online at least.
[5:13:32] studoge66: "liget" hahaha

[5:13:36] kiroslays: Did you ask them to take it down?
[5:13:36] BrandonB21: "you get it up really fast" i came in at wrong time
[5:13:39] Nevindaz: did you saw the Preach drama? LUL
[5:13:42] Teriyakibro: LULW
[5:13:43] Zippaya: the world is fucked rn
[5:13:47] xRezzylol: Asmon always has good things to say about you he wouldn’t offend you, he brought up the other day about being in one of your gdkp in like cata or mop or something
[5:13:48] Wulfknightz: @Towelliee gonna get a viagra sponsorship "because you get it up really fast it doesnt matter"
[5:13:54] cptrogers123: i actually thought Max put up a react video of you, but he didnt
[5:13:55] Reckless_Monk: preach drama is dumb
[5:14:06] Ralykx: Max didn't reach out? Thought y'all were buddies?
[5:14:09] kokochris: @Towelliee I click your videos even though I already watched; just so you get the views.

[5:14:26] Anpeo: not cool CouldYouNot
[5:14:26] SensationalBanana: I hate the react meta...
[5:14:27] Mecabeast: preach drama posts were hilarious
[5:14:27] cptrogers123: ohh shit he did damn
[5:14:28] kiroslays: Oh no doubt they should be linking you
[5:14:32] Blakimas: OMG I went to the restroom and came back, and we are still here
[5:14:35] Clay2K_: What’s the drama going on now?
[5:14:37] Korupcija_: dude just bought a 2 million house, let him be :D
[5:14:46] xsp00n: Well something as big as the first alpha interview
[5:14:54] CrankyXer: Preach has drama?
[5:14:56] Sollice: You can't grow your youtube either though if bigger youtubers are jacking your videos with no links to your
[5:14:56] Mr_Knecht_Shaft: its there a rule that u own the content for 24h before it can be posted on youtube? KEKW
[5:15:00] infamoustuna: how do you like spriests? seems like they have alot of bloat in DF
[5:15:01] player2two: is this expansion better than shadowlands so far
[5:15:02] Snabido: @Blakimas Restrooms aint a time machine 🤔
[5:15:03] Nevindaz: KEKW good edeitors
[5:15:06] severist_: Great idea
[5:15:08] Bernardo994: good luck with that
[5:15:10] PrimalRain: that's fair
[5:15:12] Nevindaz: KEKW RACE TO POST FIRST HUH @Towelliee
[5:15:13] Meowrawrmoo: how many licks does it take to get to the center of the youtube pop?
[5:15:13] Gotxiko: "Just reacting" category
[5:15:14] NieIas: just take it down if u dont want it out
[5:15:14] BlewGamingGroup: that will never happen
[5:15:16] griffdog125: And your doing the work and they are getting the rewards of it
[5:15:17] shaxxtv: do we know what trees comes next?
[5:15:19] teeders: not a single fuck will follow that
[5:15:20] belfastcl: @Sollice and the odds are that even if the links are included, people won't watch the video a second time
[5:15:23] szble: No shot lol
[5:15:24] FleuryGG: yeah that's not happening LUL it's the wild west out there
[5:15:27] ChaoticPriest: I heard about a week ago that YouTube was internally considering not letting react content be monitized @Towelliee
[5:15:28] Rudric_Ice: @Korupcija_ who did ?
[5:15:30] Bernardo994: yea really
[5:15:30] itsDets: KEKW
[5:15:31] Lunarr0: LUL
[5:15:31] Sollice: @belfastcl That's for sure
[5:15:31] Nevindaz: KEKW
[5:15:32] TemplarBean: IDK if it can happen but 24hrs seems reasonable to me
[5:15:33] Anpeo: but reacting to your contoent also promotes it?
[5:15:34] BlewGamingGroup: world first meta to stronk
[5:15:35] ggilgamech: editors are nuts man
[5:15:38] venom366: doesn't twitch have a thing saying you cant post withing 24 from twitch to yt?
[5:15:39] jeflag: race to react first
[5:15:40] player2two: the zones look cooler than shadowlands
[5:15:42] Tox1cThoughts: what server do you play on retail wow
[5:15:46] ssjshoutya: when they cant get world first anymore they try to do what they can
[5:15:46] Jon_on_Drums: is this Skyrim opening
[5:15:49] Dahkoht_Lewin: Same,read that also
[5:15:49] ShowDUH: illidan
[5:15:50] EKS90_: Yupp, also read t hat somewhere.
[5:15:50] amricatt: As champions, why are we always in the back of the cart?
[5:15:51] BlewGamingGroup: that would be awesome
[5:15:52] xsp00n: do it
[5:15:52] Konraddo: lol
[5:15:53] Gotxiko: that would kill half of YT KEKW
[5:15:53] Jon_on_Drums: this area looks pretty
[5:15:54] Hyelander_: 24Hr React Debuff
[5:15:55] P4RT1CLEM4N: That would kill the react-meta
[5:15:55] ShowDUH: @narcograves
[5:15:57] Zanzarful: no shot
[5:16:00] TheHardcorian: yeah It will kill the react meta thank god LUL
[5:16:02] monarchist96: why would they want to pay multiple people for the same videos
[5:16:05] Kasvot_Vaxt: they should add some kind of profit sharing tool creators can use
[5:16:06] radner27: how good would asmons income be after taht
[5:16:06] DoubleNova: there goes half the content on youtube LUL
[5:16:06] Jereico: @amricatt Riding in style
[5:16:06] Rudric_Ice: that would not be bad actually lol
[5:16:08] strike879: good because its just copy paste clutter
[5:16:15] Naturalbeef: YT would be a barren wasteland
[5:16:16] BlewGamingGroup: asmon would literally lose 6 hours of his stream every day
[5:16:19] ncatter: wait is this the new Skyrim remake!?!
[5:16:19] TheRealDeo_: they'd have to get creative again
[5:16:22] Luxicake: much more better danHmm
[5:16:28] Gotxiko: much more better
[5:16:29] theswampdonkee: more better?
[5:16:30] Anpeo: much more better YEP
[5:16:31] Daarksyde: lol
[5:16:31] CrankyXer: Most youtubers of a certain size and above rely on sponsors more than ytube income anyway. It won't affect react meta much if they do that.
[5:16:31] Hyelander_: TBH, React content is trash
[5:16:32] Mecabeast: react content is huuuge on youtube especially movies/music
[5:16:35] then0ld: much more better
[5:16:40] Rudric_Ice: Fuck YELLOW hes supposed to be BRONZE !!!
[5:16:40] TemplarBean: I love Ian Bates, hes great
[5:16:41] kranztheman: I think it should just have a certain period those that react can post their video.  Keep the monetization. But put a restriction on it
[5:16:45] Ariea_Whisper: Forcing people to make their own content and not react to other peoples mind blown
[5:16:47] xReadyAimMissx: @venom366 depends on your contract with twitch.
[5:16:55] Saxuzo: AngelThump
[5:16:56] Qoax: That would suck ass if YouTube did that. Content is content.
[5:17:05] Anpeo: much more gooder SeemsGood
[5:17:05] LGilbert1982: 70% of what my husband watches every day are people reacting to shows or music. He'd be so mad if they did that
[5:17:08] kungpowchickn: should give a % of monetization to the og poster
[5:17:09] Atrox93: how is the content so far?
[5:17:13] Sollice: @Rudric_Ice Bronze may be a hard color to code in
[5:17:20] ggilgamech: considering the amount of maney youtube gets from react videos.. i don't think its going to happen
[5:17:22] Korupcija_: ye preach quit wow
[5:17:23] The_Tacozilla: i think theres one more quest after this one
[5:17:24] CamelStep: When they gonna release other classes talents
[5:17:33] Nevindaz: Preach PepeWhy
[5:17:34] NieIas: asmongold's yt would die if they demonitize it. inc 1000 vids why react content is good
[5:17:45] shaxxtv: you got a link to that interview?
[5:17:46] NecroTarkan: it should be dolly and dot
[5:17:49] Cezzan: @Rudric_Ice His current model has a perfect color imo, the new one looks odd
[5:17:50] Kasvot_Vaxt: he's a tbc npc
[5:18:02] feel__alive: I know its early to tell, but story wise how are we feeling on this xpac so far?
[5:18:08] amricatt: I can't stand reaction videos/twitch.
[5:18:09] SlowMoJoe_TV: made sure to go give your video a view @Towelliee
[5:18:11] BrandonB21: is there new build today?
[5:18:16] Alienfromger: in the end there is only reaction videos on yt nothing new if they keep it
[5:18:20] Fyeah: would it make sense to add a lumberjack kind of shit into wow with so wide areas and so many trees to chop down?
[5:18:21] Rudric_Ice: @Sollice  i mean he was bronze earlier lol after he got an update in this expansion
[5:18:26] milorgpvp: @Towelliee yoo towellieee. Is there a way to customize the appearence of the action bar buttons you got in the middle of your screen?  like removing the borders etc. i assume there will be addons later on, but wondering if theres any customization in the base game for it yet
[5:18:33] player2two: this expansion actually looks playable
[5:18:39] generaljosh721: any cool changes to spriest
[5:18:40] DigitalChill: @Fyeah like new world that would be cool
[5:18:41] generaljosh721: ?
[5:18:48] dantezalive: is the tentacle the leggo or an actual shadow ability now
[5:18:49] toadette1337: @player2two what makes you say that?
[5:18:49] Cezzan: The tentacle build might be good for raid bosses but not much outside of that i think @Towelliee
[5:18:50] Rudric_Ice: @Towelliee  new weapon models on wowhead
[5:19:00] Sollice: @Rudric_Ice Oh I dont know then
[5:19:04] PublikPriest: the tentacle likely needs some buffs. They gave it considerable haste scaling but for leveling, low-ilvl its gonna be really undertuned for a while i'd guess
[5:19:11] Wolfenhoof: @Fyeah Gathering was indeed the only good thing about New World.
[5:19:18] player2two: @toadette1337 has a classic feel to it
[5:19:24] Anpeo: @Towelliee did you enjoy Shadowlands? asmonStare
[5:19:27] NieIas: show us the raid gear wowhead
[5:19:32] Obitualist: That new sword weapon model looks nice for just a dungeon drop.
[5:19:33] Staturos: Hey @Towelliee greetings from Poland! What are your feelings about WOW Alpha so far?
[5:19:38] NecroLicas: Any news about wotlk classic ?
[5:19:54] gospelghost21: how do you like the Dragonflight Raid Sets?
[5:20:02] deepsOne: are you playing new world when patch gets out?
[5:20:03] Bernardo994: best part about SL was the waypoint
[5:20:04] DigitalChill: lol
[5:20:04] Kasvot_Vaxt: i enjoyed SL until korthia then i stopped playing
[5:20:05] denflup: 9.2 was fine tho
[5:20:07] Anpeo: cześć! sayonkHi
[5:20:10] Bernardo994: thats it
[5:20:13] Ashbringer57: da!
[5:20:13] itsDets: LUL
[5:20:14] Zettabyte: Shadow-what?
[5:20:15] Brenndon: @Towelliee Did you see that preach did not get alpha and what are your thoughts on it (if you even have any about it)  :P
[5:20:15] Igrasie1: what about draenor
[5:20:17] Wakramash: Cześć:)
[5:20:18] sibimi: siemasz!!
[5:20:18] Ralykx: Dude love the old logo on the merch link again! Buying a tank! Hammers UP!
[5:20:18] loczek023: siema!
[5:20:18] milorgpvp: @Towelliee are the action bar buttons customizable at all (without addons?) or just placement?
[5:20:21] Anpeo: LUL
[5:20:24] EsteaTV: Are classes like month just not playable at all right now?
[5:20:26] Jereico: Probably means the tier sets
[5:20:26] EsteaTV: monk
[5:20:30] Tox1cThoughts: do you agree that BFA last patch was better than shadowlands
[5:20:37] cosmothug: @Towelliee i remember that vid and the fact that even you were unhappy with shadowlands said a lot in itself
[5:20:41] RiskyBusines_ez: How do you try to get it?
[5:20:44] RiskyBusines_ez: Do you have to apply for it?
[5:20:47] Consulhawk: YEP
[5:20:48] Cezzan: It is what it is i think, im not surprised they didnt give it to him to be honest
[5:20:48] Reckless_Monk: exactly
[5:20:53] Reckless_Monk: YEP
[5:20:53] krustythaklown: yeah bro he is milking it
[5:20:54] futomara01: its fomo
[5:20:58] Wolfenhoof: without my tauren-addiction SL would have made me quit, i would be a kitten-furry in FF14 now without tauren
[5:21:01] NieIas: nobbel got into alpha and will come back later this week
[5:21:02] Jereico: You can take the man our of WoW, but you can't take the WoW out of the man
[5:21:02] Bernardo994: lol
[5:21:03] Brenndon: Yeah, i agree. People are going crazy over it, im like dude you don't care and now you do care? :/ :P
[5:21:04] The_Tacozilla: I have the last of Hemet's hunting quests, I can try sharing it with you if you want, that's if its sharable
[5:21:07] Ashbringer57: he said he wasnt going to cover Wow anymore what did he expect
[5:21:10] whisperlude: it 100% was an ego thing
[5:21:12] pinkphoenix90: He said it was... not like he's hiding from that lol
[5:21:17] Korupcija_: that would be good content
[5:21:18] Gotxiko: the drama would be insane
[5:21:18] cta62: @Towelliee have you stinked the duck today good sir?
[5:21:19] HindenbergZA: he played it on day 1 and not again lol
[5:21:23] smashwow: imagine Preach not getting alpha. oh wait.... @Towelliee
[5:21:24] Jon_on_Drums: For preach it is a lot of content he isn't posting I assume aka income
[5:21:24] mrniceguy817: Who’s he talking about?
[5:21:28] severist_: thats just a bad business decision
[5:21:29] Anpeo: doood asmonStare
[5:21:30] Kadvem: soda didn't get in either
[5:21:30] Zanzarful: I don't plan on going to the party but i still want the invite.....
[5:21:31] Jereico: Obviously lol
[5:21:32] Zanzarful: duckWeird
[5:21:33] Bernardo994: That would be the funniest.  Everyone but asmon got access
[5:21:35] xsp00n: I thought asmon didnt
[5:21:38] Broomba: but you wouldnt spew crap at the wow dev to jeopardize your relationship with blizzard @towelliee
[5:21:39] Bernardo994: he'd loose his shit
[5:21:39] krustythaklown: when he put out the video that he was stopping WoW content they 100% put him off all their lists
[5:21:40] dantezalive: did you see evoker tier set on wowhead, looks like body paint from the back lol
[5:21:45] Uputz: It sounds Entitled honestly.
[5:21:47] Gapplebees1: Preach would come back to WoW instantly if the content is good. Not inviting him to Alpha was a mistake.
[5:21:49] cosmothug: @mrniceguy817 preach
[5:21:50] JzeaDecimate: asmon always will because of the amount of viewers, but others like Preach - who s*** talked a lot about WoW, I'm not surprised they didn't get it
[5:21:50] denflup: they dont want to risk preach shitting the game again
[5:21:51] feel__alive: are raid sets in collections yet?
[5:21:51] Fyeah: i feel like Asmon doesnt like to play Alpha alot cause he is waiting for the launch
[5:21:52] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[5:21:55] Reckless_Monk: I will not cover WoW content (Devs "bet") [surprise pickachu]
[5:21:58] starkos7: @Bernardo994 lose*
[5:22:00] strike879: its not the alpha but the alpha money
[5:22:07] Evcon_: how do you feel about the WoW Highlights channel just posting clips from other streams?
[5:22:10] NieIas: his chat would mald so hard
[5:22:20] Brodih_: i guess all the streamers that interviewed Ion get access
[5:22:21] Korupcija_: KEKW
[5:22:38] jhajden: i miss preach
[5:22:38] griffdog125: It’s like mrgm he was passed he didn’t get it. Come to find out he did but he had to re download the wow client lol
[5:22:40] Jereico: He still pulls up Alpha news on his stream so idk where the line even is lol
[5:22:41] Anpeo: WoW doesnt seem to be for players like Preach anymore
[5:22:42] jojoman12: based and true
[5:22:42] Brenndon: If he did not like ff14 or it did not create a viewer base for him. He would have been back with wow a long time ago probably...
[5:22:43] Lyssarah: preach shat on the game so hard though and stated he would never support blizzard again....so no surprise he didn't get alpha.
[5:22:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: he is gonna be there on launch day just watch
[5:22:44] abracka_: what are we mad about
[5:22:44] thelifebinder: well if you aren't going to do something might as well make it seem righteous lol
[5:22:44] Selfishfish: AngelThump
[5:22:45] SensationalBanana: He's been so vehemently against WoW that he's painted himself into a corner.
[5:22:47] sliproach: should you really get alpha day one if your not actively playing the game in some aspect already tho i think not
[5:22:48] AFKinthaBrain: I like Turtles
[5:22:50] ggilgamech: didn't he say he is done with wow... would not blizzard look like it begging him even after he said that?
[5:22:51] toadette1337: were u really supposed to wait that long for that cart to move? that has to be a bug
[5:22:54] raye_gaming22: its mikes fault he needs to man up
[5:22:55] akia03: pre hair preach was entertaining post hair preach is kinda wierd to watch
[5:23:07] milorgpvp: @Towelliee are the action bar buttons customizable at all (without addons?) or just placement?
[5:23:10] Brenndon: If preach got alpha he would have played 1000% and made videos on it.
[5:23:14] Mitune: Yeah, he just said he isnt doing the insane shit he did before. Like playing all the classes and reviewing thme leveling them etc
[5:23:15] nemesis981: he has bin playing the hole time as well not like he even quit
[5:23:21] ContraRob: Preach played wow even after he stopped making content. He said so, he wasn't hiding it
[5:23:23] Wolfenhoof: i was taking a longer break from wow in SL
[5:23:27] denflup: he is been out for a year at least
[5:23:28] Maytan26: even rift
[5:23:29] generalmarcus35: I thought Preach was playing WoW???
[5:23:30] Morbier: is this skyrim
[5:23:31] Uputz: I miss wildstar
[5:23:32] rhithmx: he quit before 9.1
[5:23:33] the_general01: preach is ok. its not like he didnt do anything a normal sane person wouldnt do
[5:23:33] BoiAtomico: gotta be honest tho, ya'll are content creators, not baby Jesus and even Jesus got handed the nail and cross and a stick up the sides KEKW
[5:23:34] Luxicake: i thought you played but just didnt stream it?
[5:23:35] jjoohhs: tribalism WutFace
[5:23:37] PvtHudson093: Preach said he would come back if Blizzard started respecting the players time instead of bullshit grinds
[5:23:37] salak_daddy: he literally said he was no longer supporting wow or covering, why would they even give him alpha....?
[5:23:39] milorgpvp: Please dont say wildstar, it causes me trauma. i miss that game so much man
[5:23:41] Alienfromger: whats wildstar?^^
[5:23:55] abracka_: didn't preach say he didn't even give a fuck about getting alpha lol
[5:23:59] Hesh3: lesson to be learned.
[5:24:02] Brenndon: aye true
[5:24:03] player2two: press F for wildstar
[5:24:05] OviTheGray: yeah.. but you can say.. "Take a break", "Quit" is a kinda hard word.
[5:24:06] ncatter: classical community blowup about something that the main people are making no big fuzz about, Preach even said he loves going to the RWF events still let the man play what he wants
[5:24:08] the_general01: its his ff14 community
[5:24:11] Tizbit: he's silly
[5:24:12] griffdog125: Ooo you know he plays offline lol
[5:24:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: streamer andy's
[5:24:14] YellowKiwi: F
[5:24:17] milorgpvp: F
[5:24:17] moa285: F
[5:24:18] UlsterFarl: F
[5:24:22] LuluandPix: F
[5:24:23] Selfishfish: F it was fun
[5:24:24] toadette1337: Streamers should not be beholden to their communities, you should do what you want to do when you want to do it and let everything else be
[5:24:25] Murlock07: F
[5:24:26] Wolfenhoof: well alot of people are idiots, no matter where (tauren players excluded ofc)
[5:24:27] zulway_: i would love for preach to cover wow again, he brought so much good to the wow community
[5:24:29] Nevindaz: yea on the wow forum is an enitre post about him KEKW
[5:24:30] szble: His ff14 community would freak
[5:24:42] unresolved_broccoli: Asmon took a break from everything
[5:24:42] Teldrin89: tbh I don't really want Mike to cover WoW - I want him to play it and enjoy it
[5:24:42] WSeveryn: @towelliee ok so i reinstated wow again.  been gone for like a year.  having a ton of fun.  I blame you for my enjoyment! towLove
[5:24:49] Uputz: @Towelliee He created the position himself by saying it to get points from his audience.
[5:24:50] log_in2: ew ff
[5:24:53] cptrogers123: Was wildstar actually a good game? Never played it myself
[5:24:54] gitttyjoo: ff14 has the worst players imo lol
[5:24:59] KhalaVenix: may took a break and even stopped playing it, had a impact on their community aswell
[5:25:03] Bernardo994: yea because Blizz are a bunch of assholes
[5:25:04] denflup: and now FF14 is dead
[5:25:05] Cezzan: I mean we dont quit wow, we just take breaks LUL
[5:25:05] KhalaVenix: many
[5:25:07] Brenndon: That's preach for ya >< :P
[5:25:09] jenos01: lol hating on ff
[5:25:10] Nevindaz: y I think he take it 2 seriously.. bcuse in the end is a fcking game .. lol
[5:25:11] delaine: Do we know what the upgrades to dragon riding will be? More charges? Longer flight/glide time? etc
[5:25:11] Bernardo994: thats why ppl tyook a break
[5:25:12] jojoman12: he was looking for attention
[5:25:13] Hupu_a: declaration of independece of wow
[5:25:15] Bernardo994: took*
[5:25:17] Paulyepsi: Preach was expecting to receive alpha
[5:25:21] Akermay: definitely appreciate your stream and chat (generally) being so chill
[5:25:22] Nevindaz: yea
[5:25:23] krustythaklown: his quitting was more against blizzard than wow
[5:25:26] BROKENARROVV: @Aruar89 still get a queue every single day
[5:25:27] Aquadriel: jenos01 i mean is dog shit
[5:25:28] cosmothug: @Towelliee there was also all the harassment stuff that turned the public against WoW
[5:25:31] pepega_in_the_chat69: uh oh drama!
[5:25:31] Murlock07: he does
[5:25:34] gramoudan: I miss Ghost + Preach :(
[5:25:37] crittinkitten: Preach made it very clear if wow/blizzard fixed itself he would come back
[5:25:37] Ahrmanhamma: He literally said he'd go back if Blizz changed things. The video was just about not doing daily WoW content anymore
[5:25:38] jackymoon: sure he plays... just not streaming it
[5:25:39] Brenndon: Yeah he is, i love him for it and at the same time hate him for it hehe :D
[5:25:41] PenguMingu: People who say FF is dead are true pepegas LOL
[5:25:43] Broomba: FF is dead @Aruar89 lol!!!!!
[5:25:44] Ahrmanhamma: He said it in the video
[5:25:47] PvtHudson093: He wants to play WoW but he really hates the grind
[5:25:48] jenos01: @Aquadriel right
[5:25:50] PenguMingu: I don't even play FF and know it's not dead
[5:25:52] player2two: love the classic song in this zone
[5:25:54] Zippaya: and there is nothing wrong with that
[5:25:55] denflup: fckikng bobby man
[5:25:58] OviTheGray: oooh... kill coca-cola bear :)
[5:25:58] Brenndon: But he could LITERALLY contact blizzard and ask for alpha and he would get it.
[5:26:00] malacathwow: Didn't he say in a video some time ago that he wouldn't cover blizzard games and that if he had received alpha he wouldn't play it?
[5:26:00] Nevindaz: ofc.. bcuse he played from vanilla .. he alpha tested wotlk and every patch also ..
[5:26:07] Uputz: @Towelliee World of Warcraft didn't abused people in the workplace. To say you wont create content because of what happen was goofy to begin with.
[5:26:08] Phantomstrk: so he didn't get access to something that he supposedly didn't want, didn't try for ?  i think the real reason is he expected them to come to him and that didn't happen and that's the core of the issue
[5:26:10] Nevindaz: ofc he has strong bonds within wow
[5:26:13] dracullus: @Towelliee but he could just, you know, ask devs if they give him access because he's interested covering wow again, but of course mr overblown ego had to do it his way
[5:26:17] Broomba: love what people say a game is dead -- based on metrics
[5:26:21] Jereico: Probably too proud to actually reach out to them lol
[5:26:33] Gingerprimer: Maybe he should have applied to alpha as CC if he wanted in
[5:26:35] cosmothug: WoW is safe until the Riot MMO comes out
[5:26:36] Brenndon: @coffeeandsteve yeah think so
[5:26:36] SensationalBanana: Tbf Preach has gone down the HeelvsBabyface hole of negativity, so... I think he's a lost cause.
[5:26:40] Mecabeast: still miss the fatboss guides
[5:26:41] Koller1990: Koller1990 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 94 months! 
[5:26:45] Kloshx: who are he talking about?
[5:26:46] Nevindaz: KEKW
[5:26:50] Pryzmic: KEKW
[5:26:51] balancedlight: preach had hopeful negativity though. lol
[5:27:02] S1appadabass: sometimes you just gotta take a break
[5:27:03] philsbad2: hows SP looking in the alpha?
[5:27:05] JiberishUI: COCACOLA BEAR
[5:27:06] Brodih_: Preach complaining? no...
[5:27:08] Cezzan: Asmon accepted that if wow sucked there were other games to play, good mentality
[5:27:09] KridenTagg: Preach was pretty adamant that he was done with WoW during Shadowlands.  I don't know why he thought he would get early access to Dragonflight.
[5:27:12] Nevindaz: nah he only mimic that.. he is Malding alltime KEKW
[5:27:14] instructOS: i dont watch people who are mad all the time
[5:27:14] cptrogers123: And now the community wont understand why they are playing other games now lol
[5:27:15] pepega_in_the_chat69: he just wanted to feel wanted and frankly blizzard doesnt want him anymore.
[5:27:16] cosmothug: @balancedlight he said hes done with WoW so it makes sense why they wouldnt bother giving him an invite
[5:27:18] Gapplebees1: Preach was very positive about Shadowlands until Blizzard ignored the community about Torghast
[5:27:20] Wolfenhoof: FF14 is a great game, i played 2 months some years ago. The crafting and housing alone is worth it. But no tauren :(
[5:27:22] procyon_mfc: pewpew
[5:27:22] Snabido: Has wow ever been healthy? 😏
[5:27:23] Brenndon: speaking of breaks, i'm playing DAJoC atm haha :P
[5:27:26] Tizbit: i mean social contagion makes u kinda want to hate things because it's "cool"
[5:27:27] velkoff: @Towelliee at this point wow is part of life not a game
[5:27:31] Akermay: Mind blasting the chat with these facts right now
[5:27:31] denflup: rich campbell as well
[5:27:34] ggilgamech: and it is not like blizzard did something wrong too... he made a statement about stopping wow. they stopped contacting him, looks normal to me
[5:27:38] Brenndon: DAoC*
[5:27:43] Nevindaz: Preach played from vanilla .. he alpha tested wotlk and every patch also ... he has strong bonds
[5:27:54] NieIas: the ff hype is gone now and wow is getting back on its feet
[5:27:58] kungpowchickn: Think its just playing a single game for too long
[5:28:02] renavii: hey tow...what is the best thing so far in dragonflight ?
[5:28:05] cptrogers123: And now the community wont understand why they are playing other games now lol
[5:28:06] Mitune: Honestly thought it was probably the best thing for Preach to stop making the vids he did. The fact he leveled all the classes reviewed them etc was too much for anyone
[5:28:06] griffdog125: That comes back to having a cancerous community also
[5:28:10] SensationalBanana: @NieIas Amen to that.
[5:28:10] Gingerprimer: @ggilgamech yeah stops covering wow and does not apply for alpha is shocked that he did not get alpha
[5:28:11] DigiD702: DigiD702 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:28:14] Bladerdiblaat: It's the dumbass tribalism that's causing all the problems. Let people play what they want and you should do the same.
[5:28:19] VitochieR1: @towelliee when u get a mindblast proc can you use it while channeling mind flay?
[5:28:29] JordiJopie: I hope Shamans are gonna have some cool stuff added in DF
[5:28:38] Cezzan: I mean thank god so much people left, it was the hard slap blizz needed to get back on their feet
[5:28:41] MrKhanes: @Bladerdiblaat So true!
[5:28:43] ggilgamech: @Gingerprimer nope, it's his fault...
[5:28:47] Jereico: @VitochieR1 This is not a thing in Dragonflight Alpha
[5:28:49] dracullus: xD
[5:28:52] generaljosh721: wait you had to sign up? lol then why is he crying?! just creating nonsense drama
[5:28:53] temp3st98: My brain was in the same state when playing wow and i stoppped play wow and went to play ff now im back to wow and happy again
[5:28:56] Roaringkittylol: Preach shot himself in the foot and I think he is being petty lol.
[5:28:59] Luxicake: or maybe he did sign up but he's just saying he didnt so that people dont think he got shafted as bad *tinfoil hat*
[5:29:00] Broomba: @towelliee -- is signing up for alpha the same as beta optin?
[5:29:05] Jereico: @VitochieR1 Vampiric Insight (the new passive) works differently from Dark Thoughts (current live passive)
[5:29:05] Gingerprimer: @ggilgamech yeah true
[5:29:06] Brenndon: LOL, oke i did not know that @Towelliee. Then why does he expect to get it when he did not sign up? or even be sad about it...
[5:29:06] pepega_in_the_chat69: blizzard was like fuck us? oh yeah ok, no alpha for you HAHA
[5:29:16] Cezzan: @VitochieR1 Wait really? that sucks lol
[5:29:17] stillkold: did they have a gfx update for wow? why does it look better?
[5:29:18] ggilgamech: @Gingerprimer well towel explain it while i was writing
[5:29:19] Phantomstrk: doesn't appear to be anything to do with blizzard.  It seems he didn't try according to his tweet, but maybe expected them to come to him and "ask" to play the alpha, that didn't happen obviously, and so it's more about a shot to his pride
[5:29:22] Gingerprimer: @Broomba CC have a diffrent thing for alpha/media acces
[5:29:25] Quojin: sounds like he had very little to bleat about
[5:29:30] The_Tacozilla: @Towelliee I think there is one more quest, I have one in my quest log thats around camp nowhere to the south to kill a gnoll
[5:29:35] VitochieR1: @coffeeandsteve gotcha ty ye hope that gets a rework otherwise class is going to feel clunky forsure
[5:29:39] Broomba: @Gingerprimer awww
[5:29:47] dracullus: FOCKIN BLIZZARD DIDNT GAVE ME ALPHA ON SILVER PLATTER I'M SUPPOSED TO SIGN UP LIKE A PLEB??
[5:29:49] Jereico: @VitochieR1 It behaves more like the old Shadowy Insight passive, it doesn't have the cast while channeling thing anymore on the proc
[5:29:56] xReadyAimMissx: @stillkold a few years ago yes, plus I think more models are getting updated with this expansion.
[5:30:00] Boostedmk6: been signing up for like 10 yrs never got picked lol
[5:30:04] Fyeah: i dont think Blizzard would not wanna give him the alpha for any reasons, giving alpha to ppl like Preach is a good thing overall.
[5:30:12] bendsber: Its the times
[5:30:12] Dagomarus: Yeah if he didnt sign up thats on him, aint no body getting free hand outs
[5:30:20] Jereico: For what it's worth a lot us are kind of tired of cast while channeling in raid and M+ content, but the spec probably does need a bit of love
[5:30:20] BubblePriest: bro.... back in the day friends and family lists used to feel so warm
[5:30:21] Gingerprimer: @Broomba but also if you sign up for beta your chances of getting are prob higher
[5:30:34] Bernardo994: never know you might get lucky
[5:30:35] zgag: Wow was content for Asmon is a drama sense.  FF was more for his way of giving the middle finger to Blizzard.  After a dev called him an idiot.
[5:30:38] generaljosh721: how do they notify you of the sign ups? Do they reach out to twitch for your contacts and direct mail you?
[5:30:39] Nevindaz: yea KEKW
[5:30:41] zgag: in *
[5:30:43] Broomba: you have to let blizzard know you want to sign up for alpha?
[5:30:48] Gunlove: I have a friend who played wow back in BC was out he gets every alpha and I get zero and I have played since Vanilla XD
[5:30:51] jdcpit: I got alpha but im on an FNF list. Evokers are hard
[5:30:52] Leemann9: 100% ego trip @towelliee
[5:30:54] toadette1337: When do you think us peasants will get a chance to try this?
[5:30:55] Brenndon: That kinda sounds silly yeah
[5:30:55] WSeveryn: @towelliee fyi using your ui in live and really enjoying the feel of it on my Veng DH
[5:30:58] ggilgamech: if he didn't make that video about giving up on wow ... he would 99% get it even without signing up
[5:31:00] Bernardo994: i always opt in and been here for 15 years and only got BFA beta
[5:31:01] ringol69: how you finding dragonflight toweliee
[5:31:01] TheRobWatling: who didn't get alpha and is salty?
[5:31:02] Gingerprimer: @generaljosh721 direct contac thourhg mail/discords
[5:31:02] EKS90_: @zgag or.. he actually likes final fantasy as he has stated?....
[5:31:03] Phantomstrk: yes, @Towelliee that's exactly the mindset it seems to be
[5:31:04] stillkold: @stillkold Is this classic or retail current?
[5:31:07] Tizbit: i got picked once and i wasnt actually playing the game and didnt even know until i was going through my email a year later and saw i was invited lol this happened for legion
[5:31:11] Gingerprimer: @TheRobWatling Preach
[5:31:13] Broomba: @Gingerprimer i opt in for every beta of wow expansions
[5:31:13] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[5:31:16] Cezzan: Pyro KEKW
[5:31:16] Nevindaz: KEKW KEKW KEKW
[5:31:17] Phantomstrk: Gotem
[5:31:18] xxsargexx: lol
[5:31:21] Robix256: why do they even have a signup for alpha if they only invite people they want?
[5:31:22] TheRobWatling: ahhh okay thanks @Gingerprimer
[5:31:22] KhalaVenix: i think pyro is THE LEAST one to care
[5:31:22] JzeaDecimate: KEKW
[5:31:23] denflup: Pyro KEKW
[5:31:27] temp3st98: lol he's never getting alpha or beta again KEKW
[5:31:27] Jereico: Oh that would be hilarious
[5:31:28] Broomba: emotional damage
[5:31:30] JordiJopie: Bruh signing up is literally a click KEKW
[5:31:34] Jereico: You know that would be so funny
[5:31:35] Leemann9: oh the sweet sounds of the presumed entitlement
[5:31:38] Pivvy_: KEKW someone explain the pyro stuff to me
[5:31:40] iunbearable: Times are changing
[5:31:58] Paulyepsi: Of all people I think pyro would be blacklisted lol
[5:31:59] Ponickz: me too since wrath i been playing the reg ptr and reporting since then and never got 1 beta alpha
[5:32:00] VitochieR1: @coffeeandsteve yes but I only don’t like doing searing nightmare while channeling but having the option to use mind blast prices while channeling or not is fluid gameplay
[5:32:01] Ety_TV: i wonder what will happen if Preach get alpha now. Is he going to play it against the opinion of his community?
[5:32:01] whyabadi: Preach will get ffxiv alpha...
[5:32:04] Phantomstrk: sign up to be considered for access
[5:32:05] generaljosh721: you have to sign up to even be eligible
[5:32:05] TompsonX: That's for later lol you sign up for beta
[5:32:09] toadette1337: is that the actual zone soundtrack or are u playing vanilla wow music in the background?
[5:32:10] milorgpvp: Everyone else has a chance to get in later in the alpha/during beta
[5:32:13] zgag: @Commander_Eggi Never said he didn't enjoy it.  He started to play FF within a week after he was called an idiot by Blizzard.  That was his first go at playing FF
[5:32:15] EKS90_: thats... how betas work too.,.. not everyone that signs for beta gets  beta..
[5:32:15] malacathwow: @Pivvy_ Very dramatic personality with some bagage on his back, left wow on a very dramatic video
[5:32:16] ditaern: Riding a carriage? Is this Skyrim?
[5:32:16] xsp00n: gotta try out if you want to be on the team
[5:32:22] Cezzan: @Pivvy_ Pyro quit wow and theres a lot of videos of him being super pissed about wow and it was a big meme
[5:32:27] Korupcija_: so true KEKW
[5:32:28] CullenPrime: I always signed up for the WoW betas and I got into every one  except for Burning Crusade
[5:32:31] Broomba: sign up -- its a big pot luck bowl draw
[5:32:36] generaljosh721: he'll be invited when the game releases KEKW
[5:32:37] Pivvy_: Fair ty chat ♥
[5:32:39] Phantomstrk: 4 days
[5:32:40] Mitune: I mean beta for sure, but yeah I just want to hear his thoughts on dragonriding
[5:32:41] NieIas: i believe theres a inv wave today
[5:32:43] EKS90_: @zgag yes but he prob had that in works for a long time. He just timed it well.
[5:32:48] Broomba: true
[5:32:52] dracullus: wait and see him not covering it anyway xD
[5:32:57] knightnighto: knightnighto subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:33:02] Jereico: "Super pissed about wow" is a bit of an understatement
[5:33:05] Cezzan: @generaljosh721 LUL
[5:33:06] Jereico: lol
[5:33:06] TemplarBean: Pyro definitely ha a bit of an epic gamer moment but he wasnt wrong
[5:33:07] Marleydavits: so I guess you have this data or you have been told he did not sign? Did he say he didn't
[5:33:09] Revoca: maybe they shouldn't invite him and let him wait so he can appreciate the game in a more complete state ?? just a  thought
[5:33:09] teatimetox: why would they give a average joe with no audience to show alpha to?? they want people to view it. have you seen platinum wows video the average joe wouldn't put 1/4 effort into putting information out
[5:33:13] Phantomstrk: there is enough information out there now that if he really wanted to he could react to the news that has been released and his thoughts on the concepts
[5:33:17] Broomba: @towelliee - -does participating in wow ptr builds help with access too?
[5:33:23] Cezzan: @Marleydavits He said it on a tweet i think
[5:33:24] knightnighto: Sup guys how’s priest looking?
[5:33:24] griffdog125: Alpha isn’t for just anyone. They want it to be seen and seen being played. Not just to someone playing 20 mins alone
[5:33:32] Phantomstrk: *waves* hi lula
[5:33:37] Jereico: For what it's worth, I do think the first wave mostly going to streamers and content creators makes sense for hype, they'll open it up to more as we go
[5:33:39] whyabadi: Lime blossom smells amazing
[5:33:41] Bernardo994: mango?
[5:33:41] stillkold: Avocado trees take like 11 years to sprout an avocado lmfao
[5:33:41] subversv: to get alpha you have to be a content creator or on the friends and family list
[5:33:41] JiggleyBear: get all them treez
[5:33:43] kardurst: Preach isn't so low brow as to react to alpha news with no experience.... if he covers wow again
[5:33:53] Ponickz: damn must be a great yard
[5:33:54] Revoca: @teatimetox average joes test the game and report bugs...
[5:33:57] bendsber: The laterns are my fav lol
[5:34:03] xReadyAimMissx: I miss having trees, hell I miss having a yard. danSad
[5:34:05] Ponickz: you have a pick of your yard anywhere?
[5:34:05] WSeveryn: @towelliee that sounds amazing.   those trees
[5:34:06] ditaern: @whyabadi They don't have public Alpha or Beta, everything is tested in-house.
[5:34:08] Bernardo994: mango on tree yea
[5:34:08] JordiJopie: I’m not a content creator so I might not understand but why does he care if he doesn’t wanna give feedback?
[5:34:10] unstawpable91: florida is nice at least you can literally grow any fruit
[5:34:14] ggilgamech: i mean when you a very big dramatic video about leaving wow, you are supposed to expect to not get in this things anymore
[5:34:15] The_Tacozilla: @Towelliee I think it's one more and then that's it for Hemet, unless there's a extra one for doing them all
[5:34:17] Cezzan: @coffeeandsteve Yeah, its the logical thing to do, beta is more focused on actual feedback and getting a lot more people in
[5:34:20] strike879: all them trees for Ony
[5:34:21] procyon_mfc: for this zone
[5:34:21] Robodope: Oh man fresh avocado on your back yard
[5:34:30] kardurst: @revocs this is not true. Asmongold can do beta tests no average joe can. and he does for content. Streamers are a big help for actual beta testing
[5:34:35] Jereico: @JordiJopie He definitely wants to give feedback; we can't help it, anyone playing this game for a long time just has opinions we have to get out
[5:34:37] procyon_mfc: for now and in this zone most likely
[5:34:40] CullenPrime: @Towelliee  How long do you think Alpha will run?
[5:34:41] Luxicake: icy water at that KEKW
[5:34:41] Jereico: It's like an illness
[5:34:54] Quojin: dont they all have wide spreading roots? neighbours gonna love you
[5:34:55] Mitune: Wow
[5:34:55] Leemann9: @jordijopie called entitlement
[5:34:59] Coriollis: not rushed xD
[5:35:06] knightnighto: Are any dungeons out rn?
[5:35:12] the_general01: towCopium
[5:35:13] subversv: dungeons please
[5:35:13] Mitune: When are the weekly updates Thursday or Tuesday?
[5:35:14] xReadyAimMissx: towCopium
[5:35:14] denflup: COPIUM
[5:35:15] stillkold: the evolution of the avocado is fascinating, the reason the seed is so large is because dinos used to eat them and the seed is so large because the feces would bury them too deep, the seed has the nutrients to grow the sprout without sunlight
[5:35:15] Gingerprimer: @knightnighto nope
[5:35:16] EKS90_: they are trying a new type of testing it seems, lets hope it works
[5:35:19] Cezzan: They sound super confident about alpha and beta durations, but i cant avoid being scared about how short it feels
[5:35:23] log_in2: wont that just mean the beta is going to be that much longer? which is good...
[5:35:23] Havoc_S1: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:35:24] Mecabeast: think wrath beta will get 80 templates this week?
[5:35:25] teatimetox: @revoca ya in beta!!! alpha isnt for anyone it's for people who have communications with the developers and a larger audience to see the game lol
[5:35:35] bendsber: what is next zone they will open up
[5:35:35] salak_daddy: what is your prediction for release date?
[5:35:39] icerasta: Max said on stream last night that it should be tomorrow for new build
[5:35:45] unstawpable91: @Towelliee do you think blizz can make the launch date by the end of the year? or do you forsee a small pushback
[5:35:49] Jereico: @Cezzan I think they're probably on track for most of the general content, I'm just worried about them having time for class design and talents
[5:35:51] Coriollis: ooo nice
[5:35:55] bendsber: nice
[5:35:56] Korupcija_: I guess they will test this zone again in beta?
[5:35:57] Milanesa_De_Pollo: will the current zone be disabled next week? or will the next zone be added along with this one next week
[5:35:58] generaljosh721: have they announced what will be in phase 2?
[5:36:02] WSeveryn: @towelliee the way everything runs I think the may get the new expansion may be out this year
[5:36:03] zgag: More invites should be going out by the next build too
[5:36:04] bendsber: lol
[5:36:17] generaljosh721: week after Thanksgiving
[5:36:21] ali2ak: !YT
[5:36:22] Moobot: @ali2ak Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW Editable UI System - DRAGONFLIGHT ALPHA EXCLUSIVE youtu.be/jst2FvVYB00
[5:36:22] strike879: tbh so far this looks more like beta  then alpha yet to see a missing model box
[5:36:24] generaljosh721: that's my prediction
[5:36:24] Gotxiko: 3-4month season 4 before prepatch
[5:36:27] Mitune: I just hope they have enough content outside fo the main three. I really do
[5:36:31] dracullus: @Towelliee imo 26th October pre-patch and 15th November launch
[5:36:32] Coriollis: this smells december release yes
[5:36:37] Hupu_a: just hope it wont be like it has been and raid is just at chrismass
[5:36:38] the_general01: Alpha Beta? NERDS!!
[5:36:40] migas03: this alpha is way far ahead compared to BFA and SL alphas
[5:36:42] moa285: I don't really understand. If the alpha will be done by closing one zone and opening the other... how will the beta be done?
[5:36:44] Korupcija_: it will be a one day race and EU will be salty, mark my words
[5:36:56] Uputz: I think they will do the RWF in January again.
[5:36:58] unstawpable91: they got a small injection in talent now at least with that studio acquisition.  can help alot
[5:36:58] Phantomstrk: 4 month alpha/beta period is not terrible if they got a bigger head start on this expac because they abandoned stuff in SL to focus earlier
[5:37:02] souplordtv: @moa285 all zones and stuff unlocked
[5:37:04] kardurst: The raid will go live after new years
[5:37:04] propwash80: is the talent tree out for pallys?
[5:37:06] Mikromanagement: thatd be good, kinda same as last time
[5:37:08] dracullus: 3 resets - 2 for event and 1 for class changes
[5:37:10] xxsargexx: @Korupcija_ EU is salty even when they win
[5:37:11] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[5:37:13] ringol69: wotlk two to 4 weeks pre patch
[5:37:13] Mitune: In terms of quality in comparison to past Alpha where does this one sit? @Towelliee
[5:37:13] generaljosh721: they wont release it over thanksgiving because many people take time off around that time
[5:37:18] moa285: @rhyssgg SeemsGood
[5:37:18] Jereico: @propwash80 Not yet, but some stuff has been mined
[5:37:20] Blyzerx: unstawpable91 i like them too, hopefully they're a good fit with activision
[5:37:21] crumb321: pretty close to wotlk, kinda strange
[5:37:30] 91Niki: @Towelliee Were you guys talking about the 310 comment thread on the wow forums of people arguing about Preach getting alpha? LUL I was afk
[5:37:32] Kasvot_Vaxt: it will be ready Copege
[5:37:33] Hupu_a: Should just annaunce the releast at 1.1.23
[5:37:34] Sollice: @Towelliee That automated Plans for WOTLK beta. Do you still want that running or do you want me to turn it off
[5:37:38] Phantomstrk: i think mythic would be delayed until after xmas
[5:37:38] philsbad2: whats your opinion on SP in this alpha?
[5:37:39] Jereico: @propwash80 Should be a bunch of new stuff in the next couple of days
[5:37:44] Sollice: @91Niki Yeah they were
[5:37:46] andre_scb: not having a grind system like AP=less alpha testing
[5:37:48] icerasta: thats thanksgiving. idk if they do that
[5:37:52] Ety_TV: 15 of november us the release date
[5:37:57] Ety_TV: is
[5:38:02] CullenPrime: From what I have seen of the new UI it looks like to me that a lot of people will still continue using other UI's.
[5:38:14] Reckless_Monk: thats fair
[5:38:14] audderd: audderd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 31 month streak! 
[5:38:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: the week of god of war is off limits
[5:38:16] BubblePriest: Thanksgiving prepatch would be lit
[5:38:17] ShowDUH: There's no way they do release so close to thanksgiving
[5:38:18] RiptoreCA: So, so far no borrowed power or covenant type system?
[5:38:20] lithium364: i would like that no need to rush raid beginning
[5:38:21] 91Niki: @sollice Oh lol Gattz just linked it to me wondering if towelliee saw it LUL
[5:38:24] Cezzan: Is there any info on how long prepatch for DF would last?
[5:38:24] BubblePriest: like just after
[5:38:26] HindenbergZA: confirmed
[5:38:29] Gotxiko: ffxiv 6.3 releases in dec, maybe that makes them decide
[5:38:36] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[5:38:38] Wolfenhoof: DF as christmas gift would be fine for me
[5:38:39] Bernardo994: yea y not?
[5:38:41] Sollice: @91Niki Yeah
[5:38:42] olboo: the game launched on nov 22 or 23rd
[5:38:43] generaljosh721: right after thanksgiving seems more feasible
[5:38:43] Mecabeast: like a week before
[5:38:44] Gram64: vanilla was thanksgiving LUL
[5:38:44] slabbyj_: yup friday before
[5:38:44] AlexBeardo: @Towelliee Was on 8th december
[5:38:46] Mikromanagement: shadowlands released the day before thanksgiving
[5:38:49] Coriollis: that was naxx I think and sl one week later or smthn
[5:38:49] Rayao: SL launched nov 23
[5:38:49] ShowDUH: oh right
[5:38:49] renavii: u guys know thanksgivin happen only in us right ?
[5:38:51] BlewGamingGroup: 11-23-20
[5:38:52] PublikPriest: i dont actually mind the date but, they need to announce something. Getting last minute dates makes planning difficult and is frustrating
[5:38:54] Broomba: Yes SL did
[5:38:54] Kindosar: Nov 23rd
[5:38:56] kiwifruit56: if blizz was to avoid every holiday ever, then we wouldnt even have a game to play
[5:38:57] Gevers_GgM: feels like half of WoW expansions came out in Nov
[5:38:57] dracullus: I think people wouldn't take it well, that's month or more with just M0
[5:39:03] AlexBeardo: @Towelliee well, it was the first wing of the raid :)
[5:39:05] impr123: @Towelliee  Xmas raid again best time for world first guilds most viewership due to winter break and highest ad rev in december
[5:39:08] moa285: .. or the raid will open on Christmas and Blizzard will send a clear message that they don't care about 0.1% of players anymore. ConcernDoge
[5:39:08] knightnighto: @gotxiko tbh I don’t think they care
[5:39:08] procyon_mfc: as long as servers are stable they can be a skeleton crew
[5:39:14] andre_scb: @towelliee they dont need alot of time to test like before because there are alot less systems

[5:39:15] reklebin: @Towelliee would you consider shadow priests haunting apperations as pets?
[5:39:18] zgag: Preach had that video with him telling his kids that daddy will be raiding during the holidays
[5:39:22] PvtHudson093: raiding over Xmas would suck
[5:39:24] Wolfenhoof: your guys own fault if your got family and real life Kappa
[5:39:24] 91Niki: @sollice people need to go outside and touch grass sacLUL
[5:39:28] dracullus: SL was delayed though so they picked latest 2020 date they could
[5:39:33] Ety_TV: 1-15 of november pre-event and 15 release date
[5:39:39] Broomba: SL early release was on monday of thanksgiving
[5:39:43] PublikPriest: they also need to release wrath classic, ideally giving it time to breath before dragonflight launches
[5:40:06] TompsonX: Christmas time wow sounds cozy
[5:40:08] bukka_hot: it will be fine
[5:40:10] ncatter: remember they just go 100 new developers for the wow team, stick em on the holiday duty :P
[5:40:10] Gingerprimer: @PublikPriest tbf Classic team is very small/not much stuff to do
[5:40:11] Cezzan: Wrath will probably release on september so it should be plenty of time
[5:40:12] pavepawns: @91Niki grass? is that an addon?
[5:40:12] slabbyj_: wrath classic is for sure happening in september
[5:40:17] Reckless_Monk: RIP
[5:40:18] Coriollis: @PublikPriest wrath in sept/oct most likely
[5:40:21] denflup: Sadge
[5:40:25] NieIas: rest in pieces
[5:40:27] Korupcija_: pieces the one hit wonder
[5:40:30] at1c: yeah you don't launch games around Christmas, you screw the people on their vacation
[5:40:31] berserker_strike: how long till dragonflight ?
[5:40:32] andre_scb: October pre-patch im calling it
[5:40:35] bendsber: KEK
[5:40:38] strike879: maybe they have ppl standby from home with the tech they have left over from covid?
[5:40:40] xwalonosx: I really hope wrath classic is early sept
[5:40:42] PublikPriest: the point was more that you want people to be enticed to play wrath for a bit and then transition into dragonflight when it launches
[5:40:45] m4gnify: i assume pieces may still play, just not as hardcore as before
[5:40:47] 91Niki: @pavepawns LUL
[5:40:52] Gingerprimer: @berserker_strike second half of the novemebr is a popluar guess atm
[5:40:53] story_writer_rent: this place looks wild
[5:40:57] PublikPriest: TBC launched too close to retail tier
[5:40:57] NickLeonhearth: launching an expansion around the elite 1% of mythic raiders :D sounds the exact oposite of they are trying to do
[5:40:57] Wolfenhoof: it has to when they're delaying DF to Q1 2023 Kappa
[5:40:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: the classic xp buff has been rumored for tomorrow, maybe we get some news in 40 minutes
[5:40:59] Aidler: it it out of the question that they keep their guys working over the holidays…. because stuff?
[5:41:02] Broomba: @towelliee -- i have 3 episodes left for the show the Players -- thats interesting to see the ego of Cream cheese and other clash
[5:41:07] imnasusbru: Hemet is Retired :( sadge
[5:41:08] gdtomii: Bastu
[5:41:11] diivil92: no one cares about wrath
[5:41:13] Gingerprimer: Batu
[5:41:14] Geedub13: I'm assuming late August early Sept. pre-patch then actual Wotlk launch early Oct.
[5:41:15] Roaringkittylol: Maybe the mobile games will make enough money so they dont need to transform normal games into predatory slot machines.
[5:41:27] story_writer_rent: i absolutely LOVE how the trees arent just identical reused assets. it looks way more natural
[5:41:28] gdtomii: @diivil92 plenty of people do
[5:41:30] m4gnify: i see
[5:41:35] ShowDUH: he was Pieces' GM
[5:41:40] bendsber: sure....

[5:41:49] Armdel: towCopium
[5:41:55] jarilrpg: jarilrpg subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! 
[5:42:02] xwalonosx: @Towelliee do you think they will have wrath classic slated for the week before memorial day for the long weekend?
[5:42:07] Gingerprimer: Pieces disbanded because they always bleed their good players to Echo/Liquid/Method
[5:42:08] NieIas: towCopium
[5:42:13] Cezzan: @diivil92 Wdym lol, a lot of people wanted wrath even when classic was announced
[5:42:15] Korupcija_: good guy blizzard
[5:42:16] NieIas: towel on that good stuff
[5:42:26] Snabido: How long you been riding with Hemet now
[5:42:34] crixus250x: His NDA prevents him from saying the truth LOL
[5:42:36] jeflag: thats what they did for diablo immortal too though, and on release they increased everything
[5:42:38] Coriollis: not to argue , but Immortal was ok in beta than 3 months before release everything changed according to the testers
[5:42:39] ggilgamech: diablo imortal was f2p on beta ...
[5:42:39] FreshgamingQ: don`t have time for that shyt! grinding and farming is so 2021
[5:42:40] Zettabyte: Meaningful choice
[5:42:41] blossomcamm: people still talking about this LUL
[5:42:45] procyon_mfc: you're done with this Hemet loop
[5:42:47] Robodope: sorry I didn't know I only watch towelliee videos through react channels

[5:43:43] kiroslays: This zone is pretty beautiful
[5:43:45] Broomba: is this tour on the same level as the tour of Shattrah @towelliee ?
[5:43:47] AxelyuS7: hows Dragonflight
[5:44:10] SensationalBanana: ... Diablo Immortal makes 50 million USD per month?
[5:44:22] Malarick: but whats the % value of the Hogger bundle?
[5:44:32] procyon_mfc: making more now that its in Asia - that was just US @SensationalBanana
[5:44:33] Sollice: for what you said in your question
[5:44:35] thunder993: 9000
[5:44:38] bendsber: I cant wait to hear the soundtrack
[5:44:38] Zajiko: Can you see the map yet or it maybe dosnt exist yet
[5:44:39] abracka_: 1543% value in savings!!!
[5:44:41] SensationalBanana: @bigolsadkekl Ask it again
[5:44:41] thebakeriscomingforu: I wonder how the druid talent tree is working out in Alpha?
[5:44:48] generaljosh721: i only buy 800% value bundles
[5:44:50] RiptoreCA: @Sollice you tell him!
[5:44:52] Coriollis: but is it 800% value
[5:44:55] SensationalBanana: @procyon_mfc JHC... That's mind boggling
[5:44:58] bendsber: lol
[5:45:04] abracka_: arclight seems like the absolute peak of poop gaming
[5:45:09] Syborc: imagine thinking that, just because u can cash in less, its makes it okay :)
[5:45:10] thunder993: when is it releasing?
[5:45:13] The_Tacozilla: yup
[5:45:14] Moobot: velkoff, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[5:45:28] abracka_: i mean playing it while pooping LOL
[5:45:33] dregusx: report bug soo slow travel
[5:45:36] SensationalBanana: Players up in here expecting games to have no monetization at all...
[5:45:42] log_in2: shitting over shit? good standards
[5:45:42] Mecabeast: no I think he was saying it'll be peak gaming while taking a poo
[5:45:42] RiptoreCA: That looked like Hogger on roids.
[5:45:43] RiptoreCA: LUL
[5:45:49] velkoff: @Towelliee DI want paaaytowin either in beta
[5:45:51] starkos7: @SensationalBanana no one expects that you moron
[5:45:54] velkoff: wasnt*
[5:46:00] TheK10S: Have you permanently quit lost ark?
[5:46:07] SensationalBanana: @starkos7 Many expect that you manchild.
[5:46:15] lisbonscot: oh nice, nesingwary is in the dragon isles! That's cool!
[5:46:15] toadette1337: do alliance and horde have the same questing zones and quest chains in this new expansion?
[5:46:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: I want a free to play game with no microtransaction made by a AAA developer towCopium
[5:46:24] zgag: Towelliee.  What's your thoughts on using the new dragon mount compared to using ground mounts to start things off
[5:46:32] based_takes: clash royale is still a good game
[5:46:36] balancedlight: @Towelliee its kind of weird seeing you play a priest.
[5:46:37] subversv: lost ark sucks
[5:46:38] Hank_Chinaski: Hey Towelliee! Seems like Dragonflight is promoising! Would you ad dragon racing to the game?
[5:46:42] ggilgamech: man flying feels so good
[5:46:47] rivera9: LOTR soundtrack :D
[5:46:56] AxelyuS7: this map looks soo nice
[5:47:01] Gingerprimer: Max hard quit that game
[5:47:02] TompsonX: Lost Ark Enjoyers GIGACHAD
[5:47:03] velkoff: @Towelliee DI wasnt paaaaytoowiin in beta either
[5:47:04] SensationalBanana: @Hank_Chinaski I got the impression that there's already some sort of racing
[5:47:05] Obitualist: I'm waiting for more classes for Lost Ark before going back
[5:47:06] Kasvot_Vaxt: meh i pretty much just do dailies and raid log in lost ark now
[5:47:07] Wolfenhoof: And why should it? Lost Ark don't got trauren.
[5:47:13] Ribastur0075: lost ark and ff14 in 10.3 again till 11.0 alpha :D
[5:47:17] generaljosh721: are the new UI changes only half implemented?
[5:47:18] mayonaes: man shadow does a lot of damage
[5:47:19] Korupcija_: I can't believe 70% of LA were bots lmao
[5:47:20] mayonaes: geez
[5:47:24] Alienfromger: @Obitualist this week arcanist release in la
[5:47:47] TheK10S: I am honestly angry at blizzard after the shit they pulled in diablo immortal.
[5:47:50] Wolfenhoof: @Korupcija_ Maybe the only game that had more bots than New World.
[5:47:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: got a bot in my t3 cube run and quit immediately after it
[5:47:57] based_takes: raxxanaterax extensively covered the beta and DI was not pay tooo win
[5:48:03] SensationalBanana: @syborc Apparently not. The creators decide that, not the players. Players can just opt out of paying. Done.
[5:48:08] Kisswani: void form doesn't extend to the dragon Sadge
[5:48:14] procyon_mfc: its still a fun game even if you don't pay - you just hit a brick wall near the end
[5:48:24] Xenial70: crying their way to the bank
[5:48:30] 91Niki: Cheers and bye
[5:48:31] based_takes: raxx no lifed the beta and admited the monetiziation of diablo immmortal massively changed from beta to release @Towelliee
[5:48:34] FeineeWildfireSirena: Cant wait for this expansion, thank you for the content and all your opinions and stuff it´s just amazing thank you!
[5:48:34] jeflag: tbh its not earning as much as other big gacha games though
[5:48:38] Polebegood: that's not much though is it? diablo 3 made more than that in 24 hours
[5:48:39] Cezzan: Theres nothing to do about the mobile game market, its not changing anytime soon
[5:48:41] Gingerprimer: Mods doing gods work today
[5:48:41] bawheid: scumbag predator levels of money
[5:48:42] Bernardo994: screw that game
[5:48:42] OviTheGray: @Kisswani maybe with glyph
[5:48:43] lightswinter: still don't get why they mad do they actually not have phones
[5:48:44] trailerparkkgamer: diablo immortal is disrespectful
[5:48:44] Arocian: guess some ppl don't mind the cash shop
[5:48:46] generaljosh721: all the mobile 12 yo's with mommy and daddy's cc's

[5:49:24] Zanzarful: @partoftheproblem77 duckWeird
[5:49:24] jeflag: like, genshin earn 60mil in 1st week

[6:06:46] 4eignnn: is this for retail? i just went from 50-60 lastnight lmao
[6:06:52] ShadyDax: 50-60 is a prev expansion ofc they nerf it
[6:06:58] kokochris: during these in between times; I like to just do mount and transmog runs
[6:07:12] Hank_Chinaski: Yo Towelliee, get what you are saying. But you think that Dragonflight might change ex wow player perception of the game not being good anymore.
[6:07:18] ijuki: 73% monkaS
[6:07:18] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[6:07:21] shepsie89: @ChaoticPriest Same man, me and like 10 of my frioen

[6:07:29] Zendero89: 10-31 seems to be higher than before
[6:07:29] eightiesz: Now it's 2 hours
[6:07:30] Coriollis: basicly SL never happened it was all a dream KEKW
[6:07:30] happyspot: They're making it so you can level in one xpack to 60 right?
[6:07:36] Wolfenhoof: Imagine stop playing a game not because of the content but because of some bad press LUL
[6:07:36] Lataran: is dungeon or quest leveling faster
[6:07:40] abracka_: "shadowlands who?"
[6:07:41] subversv: this area was fun
[6:07:43] svu3: they dont want you in shadowlands?
[6:07:43] chabouy: does that leveling change take affect now? or later
[6:07:47] rivera9: can we run islands?
[6:07:50] rivera9: still
[6:07:53] shepsie89: hows spriest feelingh
[6:07:56] kokochris: SL is what .. ?
[6:08:03] ShadyDax: 50-60 is the same as 1-50 right now roughly speaking, they want 50-60 be in 1-60 bracket
[6:08:04] subversv: chabouy_xarchenergy it will take effect when the pre-patch drops for DF
[6:08:05] Bernardo994: thats fine
[6:08:09] moa285: What Shadowlands? Kappa
[6:08:11] SensationalBanana: Yeeting players out of SL content? Me like.
[6:08:11] MrJack2013: they probably want the 1-60 lvling time to be similar to the current 1-50 lvling time
[6:08:12] DeanoTV: @rivera9 yes u can level with islands
[6:08:12] Milanesa_De_Pollo: but that's in Alpha tho, where you can chromie time anywhere
[6:08:13] R2RHIN0: ive slowly been leveling my Alt army through dungeons and its so easy
[6:08:13] Zettabyte: If Blizzard wants us to be done, they should just let EVERYONE in the alpha (kidding) xD
[6:08:17] Utmost777: @Towelliee they want you to be able to do 10-60 in BFA
[6:08:20] Bernardo994: me so done with SL
[6:08:22] Coriollis: they are pulling a "what sword" and I'm totaly ok with it
[6:08:23] RiptoreCA: I don't know why they just don't make questing xp rate per hour hire then dungeon farming and eliminate the people doing it from dungeons?
[6:08:25] happyspot: But are new players gonna be forced to level through shadowlands like they did bfa?
[6:08:25] Eggz1004: so wait, are they making the lvling faster, did i hear that right?
[6:08:25] maxkule: I have so many 50's because I hate doing SL leveling.
[6:08:28] Kriven: i really hope wow keep the new spread out zone design going forward. I like the less gamified zone and more like a world
[6:08:31] donin: just do the intro quest and get out of there KEKW
[6:08:35] MrJack2013: there's pretty much always an exp buff when a new expansion drops
[6:08:39] kokochris: never heard of this ShadowLands before.. Kappa
[6:08:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: sounds like prepatch is a good time for project 60
[6:09:08] subversv: so is frost DK
[6:09:12] Wolfenhoof: @maxkule I brought my last couple non-tauren from 50-60 with petbattle worldquests during the last 3 months. That was a bunch of fun Kappa
[6:09:16] Nokterian: SP looks great now much better than shadowlands version right now

[6:10:00] PvtHudson093: got to get those 60's ready for Love rocket farming in Feb

[6:10:04] warios1981: have they gave a date for wotlk?
[6:10:05] RiptoreCA: They expecting professions to be enormous
[6:10:06] Wolfenhoof: @maxkule It took for fucking ever, but i got over 23 k pet battle charms now
[6:10:08] eightiesz: Makes sense for the profession bags that have been in the game forever
[6:10:09] Kriven: towelliee needs to have a hidden snack box so all his shit dont disappear this year while he is sleeping lol
[6:10:10] m4gnify: like the reagent bank?

[6:10:57] OviTheGray: tried to buy a reagent bag in sw and see if it goes? used to be an npc there that sold some.
[6:11:01] Wolfenhoof: @maxkule i was levelling my 12 tauren throught all of that and i can't fucking see SL anymore. I will just delete that expansion from my mind once DF is there.
[6:11:02] Gapplebees1: They all run off!!

[6:12:13] maxkule: @Wolfenhoof Yeah I actually leveled through BFA again recently and really enjoyed it except for when I hit 50 and I was pulled out of it because the game forced me into SL. I hate that I cant go from 50-60 in BFA.
[6:12:17] Wolfenhoof: Only thunderbluff is more beautiful.
[6:12:17] Stormrazer78: You feel dragonflight good time to return to wow?
[6:12:18] JudgementRET: glad to hear, cities are usually so bad for no reason
[6:12:22] Minion3309: @Towelliee Is it better than Candy Korn though?
[6:12:25] Gapplebees1: Boralus wasn't bad, but holyshit was Dazar'alor bad
[6:12:26] Kriven: Boralus made me mad. They showed this huge city and kept us stock on the docks
[6:12:27] TixesDT: Can you dragonflight in that city ?
[6:12:31] Coffenatic: Better than the strong hold in BFA?

[6:13:09] Wolfenhoof: @maxkule i planned to let my non-tauren chars behind, but they was at 51-53 and my OCD don't liked uneven numbers :/  but yea, BfA would have been fine.
[6:13:12] Jereico: No at best fade gives you a bit of damage reduction, and maybe puts the aggro on your mindbender
[6:13:12] subversv: this area is rough
[6:13:16] subversv: lots of mobs
[6:13:25] jetributions: go to oribos an upgrade it

[6:14:05] OrganicJKW: 306 is the upgrade.
[6:14:36] the_general01: you can shadow mend yourself, it should help keep you alive, and since theyre hitting you, you dont deal with the downside of shadowmend

[6:39:38] Einzbern: Something I'd be curious about, do all professions share the same equipment slot? If I'm crafting an item with blacksmithing, then decide to craft something with engineering, will I need to manually swap profession equipment?
[6:40:08] nesman27: looks like theyre adding in the fun parts of ff14 crafting but leaving out the boring bits (crafting abilities etc). looking forward to this

[6:41:49] RiptoreCA: Forcing people to use professions. I like it
[6:41:58] Theliahh: do you need the profession to equip the profession tool? if so and they give combat stats that's really bad, everyone will need to level professions
[6:42:17] RiptoreCA: Sounds like they are trying to make up for the Covenant / renown grind with the Profession grind
[6:42:20] EddieMakes: @Theliahh there wont be combat stats on them

[6:54:00] Ziephier: the only thing I did not like with Wildstar was not getting some type of leather when skinning an animal
[6:54:04] MaleFrom73: that place will be littered with bots
[6:54:07] comp1: that's not fair
[6:54:07] Wolfenhoof: tauren > rest, thats all about it
[6:54:08] PvtHudson093: I smell purplz

[6:55:00] abracka_: everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face
[6:55:03] ralli1800: gotcha
[6:55:04] zavonofcats: people keep saying evoker is OP, towelliee ' hold my mana flask"
[6:55:06] PharoGames: Hoping for a new dungeon!
[6:55:11] kokochris: @ralli1800 he has the blinds closed

[6:55:51] thenormalbeast: Nerf inc
[6:55:52] abracka_: bear play might be white bread, but they slap
[6:55:56] jkitchin75: this is nuts
[6:56:00] the_general01: can we cast regrowth in form now?
[6:56:11] MrPresidentSean: this is exactly how i thought this would play and was really excited to try it
[6:56:18] AtsiGames: could tank druid come back?
[6:56:26] kranztheman: @the_general01 if it procs.
[6:56:26] AtsiGames: I mean to supremacy
[6:56:31] Lokrosa: @towelliee I think next week is also Dracthyr starter zone - Wowcrendor Ian interview covered it
[6:56:31] Brenndon: yes way
[6:56:32] billybaggens: come back
[6:56:34] billybaggens: ?
[6:56:39] shrioxie: Stop saying that my bear is op :(
[6:56:39] billybaggens: s3 guardian is insane
[6:56:46] zeitgeiz: I’m hoping we don’t get all these cool builds and talents and then end up losing them and being bland.
[6:57:01] PrimalRain: zeitgeiz that's my fear
[6:57:02] kokochris: pull the whole forest towPog
[6:57:08] jerseyfive: dont worry people will cry blizzard will nerf and bear will be dumpster
[6:57:11] AtsiGames: it do be nutty
[6:57:12] 0doz: better than actual boomi xD
[6:57:15] Norbi33: but if you take out moonfire you leave a boring... crap class its like a naked druid :D
[6:57:15] Drakkxou: I want to be a bear
[6:57:16] Daarksyde: bear pvp
[6:57:19] tylerfeld: its the way bear is supposed to be!
[6:57:22] EnerjeeGG: im with it
[6:57:24] Snabido: Inb4 Rextroy takes your build, and make it more insane
[6:57:25] EnerjeeGG: let it rolllllll
[6:57:26] love_eggplant: beari loveegHappy
[6:57:26] Subjektive: i love hybrids coming back but they gonna have to balance it a lot
[6:57:27] Brenndon: Somebody call peta on towellie
[6:57:29] Daarksyde: Starbear
[6:57:32] pvtpilot88: it will be nerf before anyone gets to play it
[6:57:32] Kriven: wait warframe is making a fantasy mmo called soulframe?
[6:57:38] miinajj: Lasor bear!
[6:57:40] love_eggplant: bearkin evyySad
[6:57:41] Fluisterwoud: A bearrr with freaking lasers attached to his head!
[6:57:48] AtsiGames: @Snabido he could do some utterly insane shit, if he went off
[6:57:53] zeitgeiz: @kriven really?
[6:57:55] thenormalbeast: PvP is broken
[6:57:57] danimoto10: danimoto10 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 59 months! 
[6:58:12] zeitgeiz: Not a very inspired name lol
[6:58:13] ashwing_: Original name LUL
[6:58:14] tebbix: Will you main prot pally on DF Tow?
[6:58:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Soulframe could be alright, it's free to play so I'll try it
[6:58:17] Zettabyte: Framing souls are they now? Kappa
[6:58:19] Rocketman1716: bear is like something Dr Evil came up with
[6:58:22] andrejhmm: I just want One expansion outside of WOTLK for DKs to be op.
[6:58:36] RiptoreCA: This feels normal though. Bear is clearly broken
[6:58:40] AtsiGames: ah yeah shadow priest. so OP, yet so weak
[6:58:43] Daarksyde: think about how broken prot pally could be tho... more heals?
[6:58:44] Kriven: I am just waiting for their Farmframe the farming sim
[6:58:57] Hitmanblood: feral druids are crazy saw some alpha duels and a feral cat has infinite healing
[6:59:04] Norbi33: did you tryed mage yet? @Towelliee or mage diden't got updates?
[6:59:09] Vendralos: Bears with frickin lazer beams attached to their frickin heads
[6:59:09] mohi7o: I just joined, is bear insane or something on alpha?
[6:59:10] zeitgeiz: Gonna get a br like fortnite next…buildframe…the a TCG game…cardframe
[6:59:14] TheVigiliance: It's gonna be the lazer bear from Age of Mythology, unkillable and destroys everything
[6:59:18] Diger11: @Towelliee the same history was with affliction WL in BFA, he was barely able to kill 1 mob, with 2 he was dying
[6:59:20] 0doz: what about warriors ?
[6:59:23] sortehenning: @andrejhmm But frost dks is insane right now no?
[6:59:36] TurboedTV: @0doz their talents arent out yet.
[6:59:37] love_eggplant: ii'd like to see arcane mage
[6:59:39] AtsiGames: @TheVigiliance a literal raid boss on the loose
[6:59:40] soulbr0: no gunnar shades today?
[6:59:41] shaxxtv: how do you know about pala? tree is not out yet?
[6:59:53] Kriven: @love_eggplant you and me both
[6:59:58] AtsiGames: @shaxxtv it's safe to assume tho
[7:00:00] zeitgeiz: They datamined the trees data just not the actual tree
[7:00:01] Onearmyof2: Pally doesnt need an interrupt though with avenging shield and divine toll
[7:00:12] TheVigiliance: @AtsiGames Exactly!
[7:00:25] Hellizzy: Paladins still based around holy power in DF?
[7:00:34] ekkiz: is that dot spread aoe still in?
[7:01:09] Metrii: I have never made a druid and literally now im doing a fckin bear on launch
[7:01:14] rymerre: bear is a dps spec now
[7:01:15] zenFX_: @Hellizzy yeah, they can enjoy their divine steed for another expansion aswell LUL
[7:01:17] Lataran: the next alpha build will probably be a bit boring right?P
[7:01:21] Templexx: *hits join raid grp for guradian druid WB
[7:01:30] Hellizzy: Sad face
[7:01:39] roach933: Hah ursoc unchained
[7:01:39] tylerfeld: that's a good solution becuase bear damage in pve is always ass
[7:01:41] Pilha390: you think the bear and the warr tank should ''shine'' on dragon flight?
[7:01:42] AtsiGames: @love_eggplant me too. I wanna see how much more insane it's gonna get
[7:01:44] tylerfeld: but its broken in pvp when its good in pve
[7:01:44] andrejhmm: @andrejhmm One patch. At the end of the Expansion that was supposed to be Dk themed. Also the Tier gear is god not the class itself.
[7:01:46] yaldzz: they need to change everything about bear its so boring
[7:01:47] jaderyu: they never do, bear is always broken, still is currently
[7:01:51] FrankTheTank1988: considering DK is keeping the Current tierset Bonus from sepulcher and Crimson Rune weapon i dont see the lazor bear as being that crazzy Tbh
[7:01:53] Wolfenhoof: i found that bear thingy completly fine and balanced
[7:01:58] FrankTheTank1988: subject to change ofc :D
[7:02:03] sliproach: @rymere1983 good it used to be able to dps in bc
[7:02:18] jaderyu: in pvp I mean
[7:02:29] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[7:02:37] angrywowplayer1337: I just pray they buff elemental shamans. Early SL was awesome and then they nerfed it since they hate fun.
[7:02:40] lucid_wow: honestly i dont think tanks doing big damage is a bad thing, it lets people feel like they actually do something on that role and maybe incentivizes people to actually play it since its by far the least played role in the game
[7:02:43] jerseyfive: you would see brewmasters, no one is playing bear it sucks
[7:02:43] thedarkaegis: Not having VE baseline on shadow is going to feel a bit bad for the leveling experience.
[7:03:01] Rugburn__: its more about Bear outside of incarn is why they arent playing it
[7:03:01] The_Tacozilla: I got a bit lost farsighting in alpha found some black dragon looking area with a instance portal that is orange and blueish
[7:03:02] TheCornRatsss: Daddy uWu
[7:03:09] joe_g_433: @lucid_wow I like that thought process.
[7:03:13] Bissenz: god damn 7 ads
[7:03:15] zenFX_: @lucid_wow blood dk is depressing, might aswell blow kisses at mobs, the numbers are so small
[7:03:20] lucid_wow: yeah i think if dk wasnt super strong it would be brew or vengeance in mdi those specs are really good rn its just blood is way better
[7:03:34] vadermug: making tanks fun will not stop angry puggers from kicking a tank the second its clear they dont know a fight
[7:03:47] Norbi33: just look back in legion.. how druid was then xD or dk..mean tanks
[7:03:47] unresolved_broccoli: Heals is boring and Tanks are expected to be Pro
[7:03:48] procyon_mfc: plus tons will wanna play evoker
[7:03:50] pompey72: towHype
[7:03:51] Subjektive: tanks doing damage again is fine but i feel like classes that are not hybrids will have issues again
[7:03:58] TheFox0228: i used to love healing above all but there's so much anxiety because once i get good at a spec they nerf it into the fucking ground Sadge
[7:03:58] lucid_wow: @zenFX_ yeah this patch is slightly different bc of tier + jailer weapon but 99% of the time that spec just does no damage at all
[7:04:01] Archiduss: The barrier to playing a Tank in Mythic+ is too high for me. The pressure to perform is so big. While DPS usually have it a lot easier and can just sit back and focus on their DPS rotation.
[7:04:12] Diger11: the only problem is for player to switch from main to other class cos ppl playing a main and that is the end
[7:04:15] sliproach: @Bissenz only 3 for me join the air force join the army and makup
[7:04:20] nyx_helios: Evoker Spots in my guild are allready taken lol
[7:04:23] elchaposkjelbo: is searing nightmare still an ability or did they remove it @Towelliee ?
[7:04:23] strike879: how to have fun tanking = dont pug as tank
[7:04:26] raye_gaming22: no offence but Tanking in raids is by far the easiest role in the game
[7:04:33] the_dunkfather: @TheFox0228 thus is the life of mmo's
[7:04:34] Lataran: does the new ui attach the play and target unit frames in the middle? @Towelliee
[7:04:36] IXITimmyIXI: you have a beautiful singing voice..
[7:04:41] razizs: hate routing as tank
[7:04:48] angrywowplayer1337: I just will not tank on my monk for anyone I do not know personally. Unless I’m paid I will not do that. I can deal with hate from people in my guild if I’m struggling, but not some random clown that’s never had ahead of the curve or or KSM.
[7:04:49] XshadowturkeyX: idk man, blood dk's
[7:04:49] TixesDT: New XP req to level changes on MMOC
[7:04:50] willie_zenn: Athene is promoting some play to earn dogshit.. 2022  Pepehand
[7:04:53] the_general01: i cant wait for wrath
[7:04:54] Evcon_: @Archiduss thats how i felt when i started out. just gotta study routes and go for it mate
[7:04:58] magemaster225: dual spec OP
[7:05:06] Diger11: damn i want to play tank like for years but i can't play so many characters at same time
[7:05:12] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Classic players are something else....
[7:05:16] RiptoreCA: Let the IO score toxicity begin!
[7:05:17] Mecabeast: all the prot warriors crying
[7:05:17] lucid_wow: yeah the barrier to entry for tank is so much higher than the other 2 roles that less people even consider playing it, healer and dps can basically just follow the tank and either heal or do damage as their role requires to learn the dungeon/raid but u absolutely need to know everything on tank including how to save pulls when the dps fuck up and pull extra
[7:05:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: ive got my friend group for heroics, to hell with everyone else
[7:05:42] senseofpurpose90: @Towelliee can you put a fourth action bar next to the 3 horizontal ones'
[7:05:43] senseofpurpose90: ?
[7:05:54] andrejhmm: They really need to rework the way tanking works overall.
[7:06:00] Ant9912: Esp on Whitemane, its all GDKP, speedrun, parse focused people so when ppl make mistakes no one has any patience for it. Gotta be full consumed or youre holding back the group etc, its really annoying.
[7:06:02] Lataran: does the new ui attach the play and target unit frames in the middle? @Towelliee
[7:06:04] angrywowplayer1337: It’s always completely bad players too that never tanked who get salty. “Wtf your route is suboptimal” says the guy that never has KSM or any mythic raid progression.
[7:06:04] T_a_r_t_a_r_e_a_n: yes
[7:06:06] T_a_r_t_a_r_e_a_n: you can
[7:06:10] senseofpurpose90: niceeeeeeeeee
[7:06:10] Manabucho: @Towelliee do we know yet when phase 2 of alpha begins?
[7:06:14] SirMouSe: I dont think it will replace Bartender if you cant add extra bars
[7:06:15] figsaregood: nice
[7:06:18] TixesDT: @Towelliee new post on MMO-C XP changes
[7:06:21] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Can you add more bars?
[7:06:21] wazon_7: how does shadow feel on alpha? gameplay wise
[7:06:21] Evcon_: also, at the end of the day its just a game. if you deplete a key, so what. learn from it and group with other ppl
[7:06:28] Hey_you_there: thats smooth
[7:06:28] maxkule: @Towelliee Can you move the buff bar from the top of the screen to be lower?
[7:06:28] ekkiz: can you move the buff row?
[7:06:30] garmin1987: i really like the look of the new ui
[7:06:31] truman0725: oh that's the updated ui?
[7:06:33] Wink05: Wink05 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[7:06:35] XshadowturkeyX: tbh ive lvled toons on 5 diffrent classic/ tbc servers and mankirk by far has the best community
[7:06:40] Texas_Mizfit: the new ui edit mode looks awesome
[7:06:44] blntmasta420: delHi
[7:06:45] Vexica22: the new ui might be decent for healing if they put the clique feature in like they said
[7:06:53] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @Towelliee can we expect more things for 9.2.7?
[7:06:55] MaleFrom73: can you fade the action bars like bartender4?
[7:06:59] Archiduss: It is going to be so sweet to dump ElvUI in Dragonflight and actually have a clean looking modern UI. Saves on the RAM memory as well.
[7:07:00] Artiiz: Can you go misery talent without having other good talents skipped?
[7:07:04] nezuko2486: the clique feature is already in I believe
[7:07:06] Zanzarful: Honestly takes like 4-5 hours with threads of fate from 50-60
[7:07:14] nezuko2486: I was messing around with it last night
[7:07:15] Artiiz: Or do you need to sacrifice misery for other great options just like in SL
[7:07:18] Diger11: i don't understatnd the argument that ppl do not play tanks cos ppl are "toxic", it have nothing to do with them beeing a tank or heal, dps'es get so much shit on their head as well
[7:07:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's going to be just hours to level from 50-60, yeah
[7:07:20] Vexica22: nice they
[7:07:23] Vexica22: ty
[7:07:27] raye_gaming22: they may want new palyers to hit 60 in 1 xpac
[7:07:36] angrywowplayer1337: SL leveling sucks so god damn bad. It’s not long but it’s a slog. They need to let chromie time bypass it totally.
[7:07:38] sliproach: @Towelliee can you edit the hotbars to be like 4x4 ect rather than lines?
[7:07:40] souplordtv: legion pre patch slapped
[7:07:42] solsaver12: that was awesome
[7:07:43] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW

[7:07:47] Shuttlelol: legion*
[7:07:47] PrimalRain: the invasions were so cool
[7:07:49] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I wish prepatch was longer than 2 weeks
[7:07:49] nezuko2486: they also have a mouse over feature for healing
[7:07:49] Renlou1: I loved that, that was so amazing
[7:07:50] NieIas: yes please
[7:07:50] Ezekyler: Legion prepatch was fun
[7:07:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: afk in the sky and level everything

[7:07:55] solsaver12: I hope so
[7:07:59] dracullus: wait, for DF? I thought it's just Uldaman 2 week event
[7:08:01] DrWraithjr: That would be amazing
[7:08:02] Bernardo994: ok
[7:08:03] truman0725: would be awesome
[7:08:04] Polebegood: jailer? who's that
[7:08:07] rivera9: i got 40 toons to get from 51-60
[7:08:07] Paulyepsi: Shadowlands was just a dream
[7:08:10] Bereghost: I like that idea, I have a bunch of characters that are still at 50 that I'd like to get caught up for Dragon flight.
[7:08:11] andrejhmm: WHAT ARE THE BEST CLASS REWORKS YOU HAVE SEEN TILL NOW?
[7:08:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Legion prepatch was great, I had a lot of fun and yeah I got a bunch of alts ready for the new xpac
[7:08:19] BoringBrit: wonder if we get evoker early
[7:08:20] Archiduss: Can we level Envoker to 60 before the release in the prepatch? Would be nice to not be behind. Oh wait its a hero class right? How does that work again?
[7:08:28] DemonicLambLive: DemonicLambLive subscribed at Tier 1.

[7:08:38] ThuRatter: Do you mean nightmare?
[7:08:39] amax_plays: hope so
[7:08:39] solsaver12: SL was a nightmare you mean lol
[7:08:39] rivera9: @Towelliee u will need that to get army of 50s to 60 for next VALENTINES mount Ques
[7:08:42] Kriach: more like nightmare LUL
[7:08:42] Bernardo994: used to read word up magazine
[7:08:43] Celestia6: I am so excited for this expansion. I love how it does seem to be incredibly far along :D
[7:08:43] TixesDT: @Archiduss ofc you can prepare and gear it
[7:08:44] jrobdad: can't get out of SL fast enough
[7:08:48] Celestia6: Celestia6 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 96 months, currently on a 96 month streak! 
[7:08:52] Paulyepsi: I hope they reduce the amount of shit needed for BFA flying
[7:08:53] ZeusDNA: @Archiduss Starts at level 58 I believe
[7:08:54] Evcon_: am i the only one who thinks being able to go back to SL zones once DF starts is anti-lore? its the place u go when u die, we shouldnt be allowed back there
[7:08:55] crumb321: a nightmare, ye
[7:08:59] Shuttlelol: i hope they dont, i love how chaotic it is
[7:09:02] Ispintowin: but at least shadowlands is not long as bfa was @Towelliee
[7:09:02] razizs: do you think blizz would ever introduce a random dungeon finder for m+ based of score?
[7:09:03] frapygaming: @Towelliee with the new ui are you able to move your cast bar so its not under your action bars
[7:09:03] Paulyepsi: Will make leveling alts easier
[7:09:06] senseofpurpose90: @Towelliee khadgar be like, wow did you eat that shroom too? well lets move on

[7:09:27] gragasentmax: @Evcon_ going back to any raid is anti lore if you think that way
[7:09:30] LadyJasmin: @Towelliee I think your music is stuck. It plays the same thing over and over.
[7:09:37] RiptoreCA: So we are looking at what, 2 hours a level?
[7:09:43] kay0234: Pretty sure this will be a boe farming spot
[7:09:46] TixesDT: music, sound fxs etc arent ready yet
[7:09:54] Bowwjack: @Towelliee what if they keep it the same though?
[7:09:57] Maskeraid3r: Can you get to 60 without going to SL? I prefer legion so much more
[7:09:59] andrejhmm: @Towelliee They will leave it like that. Have you forgotten Blood Trolls in Zandalar?
[7:10:00] jetributions: we actually diead at the end of bfa and we were in a dream and the leaders of azeroth teamed together to revive us with the power of dragons
[7:10:00] Alvari: Sadge

[7:11:01] Artiiz: Are you specced into misery?
[7:11:04] Sorrowstone: So, we'll be nerfed in first patch, same like in last three expansions, IIRC :D
[7:11:07] CVB111: for sure were getting more talents tomorrow
[7:11:10] Archiduss: How bad is the powerlevel downgrade once the prepatch hit? We are going to feel so weak just like in BFA levelling right. :D
[7:11:11] Ispintowin: so sounds likes spriest is top teir like hunter on live @Towelliee ?

[7:12:16] mohi7o: @m4gnify when you git 50, every old content piece that gives exp, gets really low, I don't think you can bypass it with party sync
[7:12:24] Youredoneson666: @frapygaming not currently, but like 99% you will be able to later
[7:12:27] DemonicLambLive: Is the castbar not being in the center triggering anyone else? towCry
[7:12:27] andrejhmm: Do you think they will make Devastation Evokers more fun or is this the final build? Because Restoration seems better.
[7:12:31] Youredoneson666: Its just not implamented yet

[7:14:56] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Isn't Azsure span next week?
[7:14:58] Virus2508: i thought it would stay and they would just add zones
[7:15:12] brandonshud: Tomorrow right?
[7:15:14] Artiiz: It still won't be near competible without unitframes changes
[7:15:17] Nevindaz: when do you think beta will be released?
[7:15:25] dracullus: are you sure they will take it down this week? it would be strange to leave just starting area for 1 class
[7:15:29] mandilozano: so we dont start the expansion at azure span?
[7:15:35] DemonicLambLive: as alphas go how alpha is this alpha?
[7:15:42] SnusnuHere: so no new class talent trees this week?
[7:15:56] Cooboomy: @mandilozano expansion starting zone is the waking shore
[7:15:57] Snabido: Question mark?
[7:15:59] Kriven: @dracullus they want to do more focused testing for alpha this time around
[7:16:07] strike879: @towelliee are they going to make the buff bar splitable? like you dont really care that much about being well fed mid fight but a proc would be usefull to see where you want it
[7:16:15] RiptoreCA: Evoker has 2 dps and 1 heal specc?
[7:16:30] TixesDT: what does void eruption (or void form?) do in DF?
[7:16:40] Daarksyde: you using any addons or are those "gold" cast bars part of the new WOW UI?

[7:16:59] tastytictacs: i like the new elementals, hopefully shammy will get some glyphs. lol
[7:17:18] dracullus: @Kriven I know, but in most weeks it has starting zone + some other zone, I just say it would be strange to have no zone for other classes whole week
[7:17:38] GuthGaming_: i see they havent changed much for shadow

[7:19:45] tastytictacs: lower tahn live at level 65, definitely will get ur shid pushed in
[7:19:50] NotYetRatedd: is phase 2 happening tomorrow already?
[7:20:02] Chiphazzord: fade more
[7:20:11] Yagr6: @Towelliee can you move the buff and debuff bar with the new default ui ?
[7:20:26] The_Tacozilla: @Towelliee I took a handful of screenshots of a few areas while farsighting from valdrakken, I can share a link to the folder if you want a look?
[7:20:44] nicknitro92: What are you up to right now?
[7:20:44] JediNeo99999: it weill
[7:20:46] Diger11: Please stop with this narrative that poor tanks and healers are scared to do their stuff, most tanks and healers have egos bigger than you can imagine and it is painful for other ppl. the lack in tanking has nothing to do with toxic dps
[7:20:48] ruhroraggy: I dunno i watched Jdotb do it
[7:20:51] MrPresidentSean: almost 100% positive it does
[7:20:52] OviTheGray: Power Word Shield might help :)
[7:20:54] R0yalFluffy: Mr.GM did it earlier today
[7:20:54] doomester: it will
[7:20:56] Graviits: MrGM did it earlier today
[7:20:57] ruhroraggy: all 306 gear after all 4 upgrades
[7:21:00] Nevindaz: y I saw on max
[7:21:00] Mecabeast: I watched someone go to like oribos and upgrade to like 306
[7:21:00] Darks4int: @Towelliee thats what max did yesterday after making a character
[7:21:03] Cooboomy: is that all crafted gear that you can upgrade?
[7:21:07] zovru: Yes
[7:21:10] MrPresidentSean: as long as thats the same gear you got when you created the toon
[7:21:20] Effin_Steffin: meanwhile.. i just got my 24th toon to max level and 260 iLvl
[7:21:59] lucid_wow: @Diger11 the lack in tanking is partially due to toxic dps but the main part imo anyway is theres no real incentive to tank and tanks really dont get to have a lot of the same fun gameplay loops as dps and healer so its basically just tank lifers playing tanks, nobody is really picking up the role and more and more people are dropping it
[7:22:00] Nevindaz: and also they first to be flamed LUL
[7:22:09] zovru: saw Kalamazi do it on his m0 runs
[7:22:10] dracullus: @Towelliee it's just your guess next phase is tomorrow or someone "inspired" you?
[7:22:14] Chiphazzord: @Effin_Steffin i also have an alt and leveling addiction with 2 servers also full of max lvl toons
[7:22:16] isstdajemand: @MrPresidentSean jdot is lvl 68
[7:22:21] JediNeo99999: New tanks starting M+ get blasted for not doing MDI routes
[7:22:49] Barret: "all" tanks pull this way
[7:22:50] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[7:22:52] garmin1987: i used to love tanking but since coming back i lack the confidence to do it
[7:22:55] thatsmybis: Too much responsibility lies on the tank and healing is a thankless job that only gets noticed when they can't correct for other people's mistakes
[7:22:56] PrimalRain: everything being based on speed doesn't help the situation either
[7:23:11] Rudric_Ice: they need a good tutorial for Tanks and Healers
[7:23:22] lucid_wow: i think the main issue with tanking is just how much information u need to do it versus the other 2 roles
[7:23:22] Nevindaz: KEKW
[7:23:30] Jey1h: my friend and me just do KSM. so nothing high lvl but with my main i heal and he dps. then my alt is dps and his alt is tank. So we get groups easy. I GET so much more shit on as a healer compared to my dps alt, and the same with him. His tank alt gets so much hate compared to his dps
[7:23:33] Chiphazzord: lol
[7:23:36] Polebegood: KEKW
[7:23:37] ashnmsr: xDD

[7:40:22] JBonezey: Lots of MoPium here
[7:40:23] Vendralos: Undercity sucks
[7:40:25] datadietz: I liked WoD and I don't care who knows it.
[7:40:27] Zettabyte: Building a full scale replica of the new hub in Minecraft would be a fricking project @Towelliee POGGERS
[7:40:30] Klax99: boralus was huge aswell but we only used like 20% of it
[7:40:36] MrTerkyMan: Dazar'alor is a visual marvel - in terms of practicality, not so much
[7:40:38] TheCakeBadger: I love undercity
[7:40:38] ThaOriginalGamester: Dazaralor was two areas
[7:40:46] Ezekyler: Dazar alor as a city was good, as a player convenience hub city was bad
[7:40:55] dracullus: bigger is not always better, it has to be functional
[7:41:01] Vendralos: Boralus was honestly kinda cool
[7:41:03] berserker_strike: quick question, do u have to buy dragonflight expansion to play it or just buy a month of sub ?
[7:41:08] angrywowplayer1337: Did you know that Walker Texas Ranger founded Europe in 1939? He landed on the shores in what would be France and named it the EU, which is short for Eastern USA.
[7:41:10] EppatTV: do you think we'll see new trees in tomorrow's build?
[7:41:18] datadietz: Boralas music SLAPPED
[7:41:18] executeart: Do you think Stormwind will ever get an overhaul ?
[7:41:19] Havoc_S1: Sub
[7:41:22] stresstest: @berserker_strike always need to buy latess expansion
[7:41:23] JBonezey: Boralus was a great city, looked realistic too
[7:41:24] Evcon_: DF alpha seems more finished than previous alphas
[7:41:24] PvtHudson093: looked good too
[7:41:32] Havoc_S1: Both
[7:41:34] Vendralos: Thematically was really cool too
[7:41:39] Revoca: but it didnt look better
[7:41:42] Dreken0: Boralus more more relatable than an huge Aztec city imo
[7:41:45] lucid_wow: DF actually looks so good so far man im so hyped
[7:41:49] IXITimmyIXI: realizing now that Flight Paths are the perfect break for streamers. Just don't manually fly when you wanna catch up. Noice

[7:42:37] LeDerpski: They actually put an AH?
[7:42:44] toffeeswirl: So the AH is available to everyone not just engineers?
[7:42:49] Tazhaar93: Now this feels like a fantasy game!
[7:42:55] RebbyRabbit: any guesses as to how long the prepatch will last this time around?
[7:43:00] Ironbrigade86: While in Visage form, your nearby allies heal 2% of their maximum health every 2 seconds. Is this a stacking buff?
[7:43:26] noool: Is the new main city for booth
[7:43:26] rewolFv: new stuff coming tomorrow?
[7:43:41] Bootrelwilkins: Bootrelwilkins subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months!

[7:43:49] noool: Both factions*

[7:46:17] dracullus: battle pets secrets are not for mortal eyes
[7:46:25] NotYetRatedd: @Snabido How do you mean relevant? You'll lose your cov powers since they're baked into the talent tree right?
