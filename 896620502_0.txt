[2:14:32] swordwindgaming: end game raid guilds disbanding is an awful look for Blizzard's grand strategy to force people to band together into raid guilds
[2:14:38] Onixblack: @Towelliee they only guaranteed loot this xpac is PVP loot. Thats the problem, not a good system for PVE in place.
[2:14:43] byron_daniel: they weren't tired in bfa tho
[2:14:49] PsyTheStudent: some people LOVE the Mythic+ loot system, they say it "makes loot feel valuable" , and I think they're nuts
[2:14:50] jerseyfive: yep f* that, 1 m+ that's it
[2:14:52] Sandisy: every aspect about this expansion feels like it was created on a spreadsheet. this activity takes x time KEKW
[2:15:01] PsyTheStudent: and this game is NOT alt friendly cause of the gearing, it feels quite bad
[2:15:04] aimassistallen: 1 more day ladies and gents until this god awful week is over
[2:15:04] letrickyxd: @byron_daniel that's because unironically PvE was pretty good in BFA
[2:15:08] jeneraljelly: yeah i honestly feel obligated to pvp to upgrade my gear but im a shit pvp warlock and just get dumpster lmao super un fun
[2:15:09] Revelations45: Mythic Plus just does not give that Ilvl
[2:15:14] xHukk: What about all the PvPers that had to PvE.. And suffered not having fun for how many expacs?
[2:15:16] PsyTheStudent: but hey alt firnedly for the secondary systems that don't reward progression of any kind Kappa
[2:15:18] abawatache: Yeah I am to the point of getting 1 High key mythic per week on my main... and I don't mind PVP, but I dont want to have to do PVP to get gear upgrades. :(
[2:15:20] byron_daniel: @letrickyxd and its not now?
[2:15:22] Antypurus: i find it funny how people could even argue before release that this would make the loot more meaningfull
[2:15:23] aUnkSoldier: Or you are a Prot Warrior and you are not invited to any M+ :(
[2:15:27] sneakypeeaky: pvp is best way to get gear :D
[2:15:29] Armdel: i killed 7 raid bosses last night and got zero loot
[2:15:34] Revelations45: if they would boost it to 220 for 15s I think people would do more M plus
[2:15:35] AleeOwnz: Hm
[2:15:38] letrickyxd: @byron_daniel PvE is completely unrewarding and dissatisfying
[2:15:42] swordwindgaming: I ran Mists of Tirna x4
[2:15:45] letrickyxd: In it's current state
[2:15:46] Zivs: I'm doing 10 every week, still having fun so why not
[2:15:48] Sals_a: PvE content isn't bad in SL. Just content feels so unrewarding since you can't actually work for loot you would want
[2:15:50] Mortiie_: no its true
[2:15:51] Elswango: shield is very cheap
[2:15:52] Tensei_c: and CN dropped more loot the first week but they nerfed that
[2:15:54] mrniceguy817: @xhukk Do you think the majority of wow players are pvp players or pve?
[2:16:03] abawatache: The amount of PVE loot intake vs. pvp loot intake is nuts right now lol
[2:16:04] CazualD: Barely anybody logs in to my guild already! They’re burned out trying to get gear that doesn’t drop. Only ones logging in are those who live to level alts
[2:16:04] D3m0nHunt3r666: you think blizz will change it from 1 /4 / 10 ?
[2:16:11] Thdlock: i only wanted to do 4 keys this week but ended up doing 10 usualyl i do 10 keys on fort 4 on tyrannical
[2:16:16] letrickyxd: @Ragehead That's the problem though, if PvE is SOO unrewarding, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth for the actual content value
[2:16:18] Xailen: we are still in the "get max level" phase of the expansion, and its far past time to get a gearing and content update

[2:17:15] Sals_a: @letrickyxd I very much know the issue. After clearing Nathria HC twice with 0 drops
[2:17:23] Sals_a: and getting pieces from vault you already have
[2:17:28] Sals_a: It feels lame
[2:17:31] casualboomer: Stampwhistle hands down the best toy in the entire game
[2:17:37] jure__: @Thdlock yo, I cant find the answer anywhere, is the loot in each slot determined from the dungeon the key was set in? In other words, if I want to target a weapon, should I just be doing the dungeons where my weap. drops?

[2:18:00] Thdlock: @jure__, i believe that is not the case becuase on some of my alts where i do 1 key of 1 dungeon i get loot from otehrs
[2:18:00] shimwood: Time to short Tomes, piss of Reddit and drive the price back up Kappa

[2:18:16] Mecabeast: it get mine on like Fridays they get down to around 900 per
[2:18:29] jure__: @Thdlock jesus, ok so I cant even target loot that way. Great luck Im having then, 3 months of no weapon in vault. Thx tho
[2:18:33] Antypurus: honestly if they gave me choice of deleting the vault and going back to the old loot system i would take it so fast
[2:18:49] Thdlock: @jure__, my warlock hasnt gotten a weapon in vault either i only got it traded so im with you

[2:24:02] Gapz: @Psychatix But its like a "spot" Great Vault design, you can have another shot at targeted loot, would fit nicely into the "loot is loot is loot" philosophy

[2:25:38] kowaikoro: @Endy253 best kill order is to kill them all at once with lust/spear EZ Clap
[2:25:39] PsyTheStudent: @Baleroc1 i don't agree, would become too easy to get the best gear. Everyone would just do the 226 piece and then work towards it for the week, that'd be way too simple
[2:25:51] burnt420: oof
[2:25:54] kowaikoro: prot is broken KEKW
[2:25:54] MrGattz: its a priest, ofc you are
[2:26:03] MrGattz: all pallys tanks do more healing that priests

[2:26:42] thebakeriscomingforu: holy priests have a lot of HPS that then can put out.
[2:26:53] feherlofia123: i was so confused the first vault week of shadowlands, cuz i thought youd get 3 pieces , 1 for m+, 1 for pvp and 1 for raid

[2:27:47] OtterChiefs: Good morning Mr. Absorbent Cloth
[2:27:50] PsyTheStudent: @Baleroc1 nobody would really care, because they'd just run that level key and would easily get the loot within 3 weeks. What they need to do is bring back dungeon currency as a Pity system
[2:27:55] warrenny: @feherlofia123 Thatd fix gearing
[2:28:05] feherlofia123: @warrenny yea
[2:28:09] D3m0nHunt3r666: I personally feel the other route is better
[2:28:10] Wolfegang16: its decrotic lol
[2:28:15] Wolfegang16: necrotic*
[2:28:19] casualboomer: Is he holy?
[2:28:20] Matus1999: its necrot
[2:28:21] Cloudemon: you had 34 percent healing reduction
[2:28:22] Hexof: necrotic stacks
[2:28:24] Zunderz: Its holy
[2:28:25] shimwood: He's gotta get his deeps up
[2:28:27] Matus1999: u braindead
[2:28:29] casualboomer: Chat he KNOWS it's necrotic jfc
[2:28:38] OtterChiefs: the chronic?
[2:28:42] OtterChiefs: nah we was shit
[2:28:43] Hexof: cant you dodge the slash?
[2:28:44] manmower: prot can do self-heals
[2:28:49] manmower: learned that in arena
[2:28:49] 3663Sharad: it's holy, but holy can pump too. it's clearly the player
[2:28:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: maybe he is the carry Kappa
[2:28:53] Matus1999: U can dodge slash
[2:28:53] casualboomer: If you've never tanked a key over 7, just stop chat. There's a NOTICEABLE difference in good healing and bad healing, ESPECIALLY on necrotic
[2:28:54] OtterChiefs: That Tmog is Sick BTW bud
[2:28:54] HappyCamperNZ: Just side step the slash PrideShrug
[2:28:54] Matus1999: wtf
[2:28:57] jeneraljelly: @Hexof yeah
[2:29:00] Nehcrom: I see the shadow priest is stepping up on the healing.
[2:29:02] Matus1999: @Towelliee why u just dont dodge SLASH
[2:29:25] feherlofia123: disc is better than holy imo , a good disc player that is
[2:29:38] HamersonGaming: why i like it
[2:29:43] azzurrin: lol
[2:29:45] bertooso: Shouldn’t you dump hp into shield mostly and not WoD? @towelliee
[2:29:51] prkr_ae: game needs to go back to when only healers and hybrids can heal
[2:29:56] PsyTheStudent: 5% aura buffs BiblbThump Blizzard knows what they're doing Kappa
[2:30:01] stjon13: ya it needs it in pvp
[2:30:03] Lew_Games: doesn't do mechanics. mad at healer for not healing him through not doing mechanics. :)
[2:30:09] Hexof: KEKW
[2:30:10] Scoodles91: if the fact that a prot paladin is 3rd in AWC this week should be a HUUGE wake up call for blizz.
[2:30:12] Wildside1177: That WoG nerf was so small.They need a bigger nerf hammer for it.
[2:30:24] casualboomer: yeah.... you have no clue wtf you're talking about just stop
[2:30:24] Matus1999: dodging the slash
[2:30:24] HappyCamperNZ: It's more yikes not get hit by the slash TBH LUL
[2:30:25] robertjordan83: @Towelliee nothing wrong with vagina's dude
[2:30:28] Scoodles91: and they were damplening other healers...

[2:30:31] bertooso: WoG*

[2:30:34] sussyrev: gmartBlind
[2:30:39] nosfreeze: why is there honor/conq points in the game, and not justice/valor? you think they r gonna add it back at some point?
[2:30:40] Lew_Games: you can dodge a lot of the damage you took
[2:30:48] casualboomer: All these braindead nobodies in chat today.
[2:31:01] thebakeriscomingforu: plate tanks used to be able to just take damage. It wasn't an issue. Then monks entered the game. Then all tanks became like monks with active mitigation
[2:31:02] warrenny: @Scoodles91 arent tanks just op in arena anyway?
[2:31:11] PsyTheStudent: @casualboomer calm down white knight
[2:31:15] winterso1dat: Did you die? mission accomplished, healer probably
[2:31:26] Methyd: a prot pally just got EU top 3 as the "healer" of the group lol
[2:31:28] warrenny: at least theyre annoying in the ow rated ones ive done
[2:31:33] casualboomer: @Psychatix not white knighting shit. I actually tank keys, and it's blatant how many idiots are piping up with no idea what they're talking about
[2:31:46] medialgg: @Towelliee thoughts on preach's guild disbanding?
[2:31:54] HappyCamperNZ: @casualboomer LUL
[2:31:55] kowaikoro: not white knighting shit. I actually tank +5 keys, and it's blatant how many idiots are piping up with no idea what they're talking about
[2:32:04] PsyTheStudent: @Baleroc1 Would still be a bit much to me imho. Mythic raid level gear guaranteed every 2 to 3 weeks while raid loot is still also nerfed
[2:32:09] Scoodles91: @warrenny when a tank is solo healing 3s on that lvl somthing is not right
[2:32:10] Lew_Games: +5 keys....
[2:32:11] warrenny: @casualboomer lol yeah unless your complaing you 'white knighting'
[2:32:14] medialgg: FeelsBadMan
[2:32:25] griffdog125: anywayssss
[2:32:34] PsyTheStudent: I said white knighting because he's hard insulting anyone who has an opinion against Towllie, which is ridiculous lol
[2:32:41] PsyTheStudent: calling them "brainless nobodies" is a bit much
[2:32:42] CatOf9Lives: LUL

[2:32:59] BuddySinister: naguuraKhadgar Alliance
[2:33:02] nheonkitty: someone has to be number two
[2:33:04] casualboomer: @warrenny it's ok. This is what happens when kids don't get shoved in lockers enough. They think they get to run their mouths just because they have a keyboard.
[2:33:12] feherlofia123: is death jesters one of em
[2:33:21] Phractals: @Towelliee what pve problem? could you elaborate?
[2:33:21] Hexof: casualboomer arent you doing the same thing?

[2:34:07] PsyTheStudent: @HappyCamperNZ lmao right?
[2:34:07] Antypurus: realms are on oxymoron in the current wow i agree

[2:35:27] Dqob_: The Horde and Alliance difference needs to be gone at this stage. No one does world PvP and the community is calling for it for the last expansion, don’t understand why cross faction PvE content isn’t a thing
[2:35:32] Secondbreakfasttt: @Towelliee you can kite or dodge that Kappa
[2:35:39] ZealotryTV: shouldnt have t o kite as a tank. thats an oxymoron
[2:35:45] Secondbreakfasttt: i do not have to heal you!
[2:35:48] thebakeriscomingforu: Paladins and DKs are not built for kiting like a DH or Monk
[2:35:51] casualboomer: @warrenny yes, thank god. If it didn't, they'd have to dial every key down enormously.
[2:36:06] letrickyxd: @Goldzyn bliz panel at last blizzcon literally said they don't want it, cause they've always had a horde bias lmao
[2:36:09] Todmeister9000: I hate this kiting meta
[2:36:10] DonAndolini: u dont have to call him a moron Kappa
[2:36:10] naughtillus: @Goldzyn Esp this expansion, since both factions are "working together"
[2:36:13] stjon13: kiting kindafun on DH

[2:36:34] nheonkitty: blizzard expects tanks to get their exercise and move around at all times

[2:37:05] kowaikoro: KEKW
[2:37:08] casualboomer: BfA's attempt at forcing world pvp was just awful
[2:37:09] PsyTheStudent: gachiHYPER
[2:37:12] warrenny: cross faction would be intresting
[2:37:17] MrGattz: well technically you can be interracial on the same faction
[2:37:19] CrucifyMTG: lol
[2:37:21] MarquisLek: it's multi-racial so it's more like an orgy
[2:37:37] warrenny: ally has cool allied races but dont have time to play them
[2:38:06] Antypurus: i think many pvers from all levels want it
[2:38:08] Dqob_: @letrickyxd exactly, you can keep the difference for “world pvp” shit but god damn it’s so stupid to see people having to quit the game or abandon characters because majority are horde I’m horde main myself and I’d like to be able to team up with alliance friends
[2:38:17] Antypurus: i think its the casual players that dont want it
[2:38:33] mojusk: ardenweald pixie getting "maldraxxed"
[2:38:34] letrickyxd: @Goldzyn hard agree dude, i'm content with being Horde, but i fucking miss Night Elves so much
[2:38:37] Zettabyte: having to deal with big-ass tauren blocking my view in content? no thank you @Towelliee Kappa
[2:38:38] feherlofia123: it would be better tbh ... lore wise it would work as well

[2:39:23] Dqob_: @rayraytheon indeed friend. You make the lore to say you’re working together to defeat the enemies of shadowlands, why can’t they take them down together so?
[2:39:26] yunsky: what talents are u using for high +10 keys
[2:39:27] Zettabyte: so @Towelliee meaningful choise......

[2:39:39] SirHEFALOT: @Towelliee Just fac changed to ally its bad, and i went to stormrage hardly any one pushing keys nothing
[2:39:41] Dqob_: @letrickyxd I just wanna race change to a dwarf tbh
[2:39:43] warrenny: Dark iron in horde tneTali
[2:39:47] bertooso: I thought there were more ally players but they have lives vs the hardcore players on horde? Or is that wrong
[2:39:52] Eviltuna13: Just do a total rework of the race talents to make them balanced and it would help.
[2:39:54] mt898: There are healthy alliance servers but if you are looking for guilds and willing to server transfer, there will be significantly more guilds recruiting on horde side on EU and NA
[2:40:07] M0nkTV: Spriest are pretty good on ST
[2:40:17] mojusk: burst especially
[2:40:23] Dqob_: @towelliee not even being cheeky but the people who want the game to remain the same could play classic?
[2:40:33] letrickyxd: @Goldzyn yeah, i'd love a Dark Iron / Lightforged etc
[2:40:38] azzurrin: If you're looking to be comeptitive you have to go Horde. Going Ally is just dumb.
[2:40:40] Koravd: @Goldzyn Working together and agreeing is totally different, they unite so they can defeat a common powerful foe, other than that it would be just a simple text for cross faction to make sense
[2:40:46] Wildside1177: All the guilds on my server want to0 raid 2 days per week for no more than 3 hours.
[2:40:54] mo197: you do

[2:42:45] Nitrosulphur: correct

[2:43:34] mojusk: gachiHYPER im busting!'
[2:43:35] Koravd: @Goldzyn Storyline. On another note i dont agree with it at all, half the story revolves around faction drama and problems, it would be very weird to be able to go to Stormwind and see Tyrande there while you are an Undead. But if you only mean to be able to queue for M+ and Raids then i think that would be ok

[2:44:01] Sollice: The mage could have blocked tanked them
[2:45:30] Dqob_: @kevaly you could indeed preserve the integrity of the game for world drama and stuff that would be fair. Allowing people to create guilds and communities that can allow players to cross faction would be easier. People also go around with war mode off quite a lot so it would make sense where they can turn it off for playing with a guild
[2:45:39] northcub: Towellie needs to try playing healer for a day

[2:48:17] qryche: you seem to be tearing this up pretty good but why does it seem like its going slow? its like your going fast but its taking long? maybe i need more coffee.....
[2:48:19] BQAD: @warrenny nah, i think yesterday or a couple days ago he got the necrotic wake mount and it was hilarious
[2:48:50] derry10: I think they should allow you to just Pug cross faction. Kind of like a mercenary system.
[2:48:58] stjon13: meh just make it so can raid/dung together everything else seperate
[2:49:17] bakurathewolf: !uptime
[2:49:17] Moobot: Towelliee has been live for 2h 49m
[2:49:24] Affiiance: If theres one thing I have learned over the years about this game, its Mythic Raiders will NEVER be happy
[2:49:28] Zarinna2015: I hate the fact alliance matters less and less. I stopped watching you after you switched to horde.
[2:49:31] kowaikoro: KEKW 11
[2:49:51] warrenny: @bqad Not got any dungeon mount 😭got corridor creeper finally tho
[2:49:55] casualboomer: Prideful before last add FeelsBadMan
[2:50:08] InTheDM: Even with the initiatives for PvP and gear. Alli still is really just more of a casual player base, considered switching a few but LIMIT have been steadily restoring my faith😂
[2:50:13] BQAD: @warrenny kinda same
[2:50:21] casualboomer: Maybe they're just optimistic that they'll wipe a couple times and get it back anyways LUL
[2:50:27] BlueBlurPrime: as a casual I only do Heroic Raiding and even then so far my guild is 6/10
[2:50:32] Horseweave: Alliance is, and forever will be, under the Casual Spotlight
[2:50:41] bertooso: I think people kind of blow it out of proportion, it’s really only an issue if you play a lot and have time to gear AND care
[2:50:50] swordwindgaming: Watching Blizzard be pro-Horde since TBC has been a pain in my side. If player pop can't be saved, just nuke Alliance so everyone can play together.
[2:50:52] bertooso: For mythic raiding
[2:50:58] bertooso: Which clearly those left do not
[2:51:07] Koravd: @Goldzyn Yeah you could make it so you can pug keys, raid and pvp with the other faction it would be just anti what the lore has written but i guess if nobody cares about that these days then they will prob change it. Theres a reason they havent changed it yet
[2:51:19] Koravd: @letrickyxd And viceversa
[2:51:19] reinhardtdog: Switch everyone to Horde and make Alliance just NPC's haha j/k
[2:51:40] jure__: big pump
[2:51:47] M0nkTV: 220ish
[2:51:48] Affiiance: They get to use PI on themselves now

[2:52:44] PadidinJones: @Towelliee you need to be drinking to hadnle the spear!
[2:53:09] byron_daniel: LOL she drifted
[2:53:13] Dqob_: @kevaly I love the story of wow, I left the game this expac just cause of how boring gearing is but there’s definitely some problems with the game that they need to sort before I’ll come back :)
[2:53:17] phatmatt85: Why are you tanking him in the bubble ?
[2:53:23] byron_daniel: yeah there's always extra orbs on the secodn time, its bugged
[2:53:25] letrickyxd: @kevaly in any game. Gameplay > Story is always considered more, and also the story does not get harmed from cross faction play AT ALL
[2:53:36] kappaday23: Kappa
[2:53:44] D3m0nHunt3r666: @Towelliee noticed since yesterday this place is bugged AF again
[2:53:58] Mallaes: She punching
[2:54:05] jeneraljelly: get that anima so rewarding
[2:54:10] letrickyxd: @kevaly what makes people log on daily to wow? gameplay. What keeps subs rolling? Gameplay. Story is cool and good, but never overarcs gameplay

[2:55:46] Naynee: hmm
[2:55:46] Koravd: @letrickyxd How do you know that info? There's a reason why they havent done it knowing Alliance has less people participating in "gameplay"
[2:55:48] ChaoticPriest: EZ
[2:55:48] Dizmal: @Towelliee - want to do an SD 13?
[2:55:54] Nocteres: woo

[2:56:22] jure__: dmg really ramps up post 210
[2:56:30] letrickyxd: @kevaly That's literally how games work? People who like games only for the story sub for the patch and then quit. What keeps people subbed throughout patches? Gameplay.
[2:56:34] ChaoticPriest: trinket ilvls don't matter as much though

[2:57:01] alluza: how ya doing
[2:57:24] letrickyxd: @kevaly And also, to repeat myself, the Story will literally never be harmed by allowing cross faction gameplay, not allowing it literally stifles the entire game.

[2:57:55] Mecabeast: how high did you manage to get growliee the other night
[2:57:55] Koravd: @letrickyxd That doesnt mean you have to screw the other to benefit one. If you screw one then many wouldnt sub or buy the game for reasons. Theres plenty of people who dont like the idea and theres a reason which i dont know why the devs havent made the jump to crossfaction, im pretty sure they know better than you and me
[2:58:01] SlayerLightStorm: Haven't done ANY of the new dungeons yet. That's a shame.
[2:58:26] heavyimpact95: hey towelliee, i got kicked out from my raidguild cause they are not happy with my performance... well we progressed the whole HC in every ID untill end but they said they wont take me to Mythic raid... i kinda feel bad now and i want to ask you if you can give me tipps what i can do to become a better Pala Tank :( @Towelliee
[2:58:26] balart: @Towelliee what's the fit on the hat? I have a big ass head
[2:58:33] Maligus: @Towelliee I got me the black on black hammer squad hat, its clean!
[2:58:36] YoSaKiZ: yosakiCHAMP
[2:58:36] letrickyxd: @kevaly People who don't like the idea of cross faction, are people who hold on to outdated logic. Sorry not sorry. Again, the Story will never be harmed by cross faction.
[2:58:38] mo197: towSellout towSellout towSellout
[2:58:56] balart: @Towelliee what's the fit on the hat? I have a big ass head.

[2:59:16] balart: cool beans
[2:59:18] balart: grabbing 1
[2:59:20] Koravd: @letrickyxd Outdated logic? I don't really understand your point but its all good, hopefully they do what you want them to do i guess
[2:59:20] D3m0nHunt3r666: Ohhh I can chance the color for Kyrian
[2:59:30] heavyimpact95: hey towelliee, i got kicked out from my raidguild cause they are not happy with my performance... well we progressed the whole HC in every ID untill end but they said they wont take me to Mythic raid... i kinda feel bad now and i want to ask you if you can give me tipps what i can do to become a better Pala Tank :( @Towelliee
[2:59:34] D3m0nHunt3r666: i thought it was only meant to be light blue lol
[2:59:38] nihav: @Towelliee about to roll a feral druid, i dont know what awaits me in the end game scene but wish me luck
[2:59:49] 91Niki: @Towelliee Wait no not covenant, the maw shirt. Got both the black and silver one HYPERS Should be here tomorrow or Wednesday
[2:59:49] Maligus: @balart my globe does not fit in the largest sized welding helmets and this hat has room to spare
[2:59:56] SlayerLightStorm: Whoops, didn't want to do that.
[3:00:20] balart: @Maligus I have to buy big ass snapbacks for my head, but gla to know it has room to spare! you bought the same model he showed?
[3:00:37] feherlofia123: how is enhance shammy these days , playstyle wise ... rng ? good flow of roation etc
[3:00:38] Gorestack: if we only played meta classes we'd be world 1st excuse LUL
[3:00:48] byron_daniel: my guild is getting a prot pally this week for mythic
[3:01:05] nihav: time to find a new guild m8
[3:01:11] balart: ngl, he needs to show logs
[3:01:18] aimassistallen: @towelliee you feel like a lot of changes are coming in 9.1?
[3:01:18] fluh_: if you wanna become a better prot pala just reroll veng dh or brew or bear KEKW
[3:01:19] balart: he prolly underperforms super hard for him to be benched on first mythics
[3:01:21] Maligus: @balart yup i got the black hat, with the white and black logo, fits well! and its comfortable.\

[3:02:09] heavyimpact95: what to do*
[3:02:28] balart: pvp gear fucks, it's so good lmao
[3:02:31] evilisg00d: what?
[3:02:48] stjon13: is that just b/c of stagger?
[3:03:17] NewWorldReign: that clip of you getting the mount on sunday was hilarious, Terry made it worse with his reaction when spoke gibberish LUL
[3:03:20] Tears_0f_sin: @heavyimpact95 find a new guild, play the class you like, it’s a game
[3:03:26] Zarinna2015: it's BS that Prot Pallys haven't been the goto tank since Cata. They are always underrepresented in Mythic raiding.
[3:03:31] melariah: ex
[3:03:34] melariah: ez*
[3:03:36] PhillyRhino: yeah, I find myself using WoG over SoR all the time unlss I need to do some damage
[3:03:41] SlayerLightStorm: Heh
[3:03:51] balart: @Towelliee was there any tier prot pally's been godlike? maybe wotlk end icc?
[3:03:57] DonAndolini: chat, does pvp gear retain ur highest rank or u have to keep the rank in order for it to keep the ilvl?
[3:04:17] Armdel: pvp until you got mythic equivalent gear then blow through the raid once and take a break to the next tier
[3:04:56] balart: imagine unranking
[3:04:59] balart: the gear LUL
[3:05:14] Teyren: Damn 2100
[3:05:15] DonAndolini: well i didnt know that LUL good to know
[3:05:22] kappaday23: Kappa
[3:05:40] SlayerLightStorm: Yeah, that's bullshit. That ain't happenin' @balart
[3:05:45] Armdel: i see a lot of people opting to do rbgs instead of arena now
[3:05:45] alluza: why not try going 2400?
[3:06:06] Mallaes: projChins
[3:06:18] LuxVulpes: @Teyren We cant beat that but we can try haha. You do your tank thing, I hide behind you haha
[3:06:19] melariah: LUL
[3:06:38] Teyren: @LuxVulpes Haha so like evry form of WoW content? :P
[3:06:56] aimassistallen: Ohhh damn I was gonna say you could use the kyrian companion to change talents mid dungeon but forgot you’re vent
[3:07:02] Teyren: @LuxVulpes I have that arena skirmish experience now lmao
[3:07:13] nihav: rofl
[3:07:14] letrickyxd: they also can't guarantee it
[3:07:18] alluza: @Towelliee why not try join swiftys rbg team?
[3:07:50] aimassistallen: Can they guarantee 1800?
[3:08:01] evilisg00d: so Towel is saying that the armor is not good enough for the prot pallys ?
[3:08:02] azzurrin: You have to be pretty good to get 2400, even if you're getting boosted
[3:08:06] Koravd: Naguura paid for 2.4k and got it in like 2 days
[3:08:37] fluh_: she's also boomy and convoke is broke lol
[3:08:45] nihav: glad i dont do mythic raids cause the shit you have to do to stay relevant is just too fuckin much

[3:09:13] balart: @Spaede nah, just your average wow burnt out

[3:09:59] aimassistallen: @spaede it’s just the gear I think. Doing 14 and 15 keys you get 203 gear at end
[3:10:03] zulway_: press convoke PepeLaugh
[3:10:13] Ezzenlive: just learn how to heal like brainer
[3:10:15] Naynee: Nerf convoke pls =(
[3:10:19] ization5150: which covenant are you runninig?
[3:10:22] Lawladin: really need to still get that dope spider mount
[3:10:24] bertooso: 14 is 210
[3:10:34] azzurrin: @Spaede A lot of guilds are qutting it seems more so than usual. The PvE gearing is horrible so it's killing peoples desire to raid
[3:10:36] StateFarm206: 15 IS 210
[3:10:38] SeleneVoelkerVT: I've been trying to get into rated bgs all week and no luck.
[3:10:42] nihav: 14 is 207
[3:10:51] bertooso: Wtf really lol
[3:10:54] bertooso: That’s sad
[3:11:19] Koravd: PvE loot is so bad, Ion already said they were fixing it for next patch hopefully we see something 19th feb Blizzcon
[3:11:32] Naynee: Congrats kubilay
[3:11:44] SeleneVoelkerVT: I did 15 keys this week alone I did not get SHIT
[3:11:53] northcub: I wonder why people have no shame in being carried anymore, having to pay for achievements used to be frown upon but now even streamers advocate for it
[3:12:20] nihav: PVE loot is perfect since even getting a small upgrade makes a big difference and feels good
[3:12:21] humbaby_: Swifty'a team carried Athene to his pop ranking and gearing
[3:12:31] byrdeen45: ya lv is all fucked up

[3:13:07] azzurrin: Blizz making bank on that WOW token LOL
[3:13:11] PsyTheStudent: @northcub I agree, but the game is more about immediate satisfaction then earning through work. Though when yo'uve played as long as Towllie has, maybe you'd also just be tired of it and would rather just skip to the gear part
[3:13:22] aimassistallen: Nah not the wow token

[3:13:36] Wildside1177: Makes arena rating meaningless. I love it.
[3:13:42] aimassistallen: You pay 50 dollars you get 600l
[3:13:44] SeleneVoelkerVT: funny thing is I never have more than 60k at a time xD
[3:13:47] Antdavs24: Need to coordinate those win trades better LUL
[3:13:55] Teevek: Whats that mythic addon?
[3:14:08] PsyTheStudent: @nihav Except you're the minority. Majority of the playerbase hates the new loot, because it feels really bad ot run 30-40 minute dungeons, SEVERAL IN A ROW, to get an item level upgrade of...3-5 ilvl.
[3:14:20] aimassistallen: Why pay 20 for 110k when you can pay 54 for 600??
[3:14:23] PsyTheStudent: and that's even IF you get loot
[3:14:29] PsyTheStudent: most people are getting NOTHING for hours of dungeons
[3:14:29] northcub: @Psychatix been playing longer than towellie
[3:14:54] aimassistallen: I’ve seen like 1 thousand dollars on a website lamp
[3:14:56] aimassistallen: Lmao
[3:15:02] aimassistallen: For 0-1800
[3:15:05] aimassistallen: In rbgs
[3:15:08] SeleneVoelkerVT: I've only been getting anima in my dungeon runs
[3:15:33] stjon13: do you get on comms w/ them while they carry?
[3:15:58] exhale1995: @towelliee what leggo do you run?
[3:16:06] Affiiance: I would feel much better with more Anima
[3:16:23] SeleneVoelkerVT: I wouldnt be nearly as salt if i got 200 anima not 35

[3:16:34] LoremasterMarthan: The scaling of loot iun dungeons compared to pvp is just flat out not balanced and thats the inherent issue
[3:16:46] LoremasterMarthan: LIke number for number it doesnt match up very well
[3:16:52] mrniceguy817: I just hope blizzard is currently losing enough subs for them to actually do something about gearing
[3:16:56] PsyTheStudent: @northcub just simply no shits given about high rating in PVP. Usually balance is so fucked, makes it really easy to just sell runs
[3:17:03] H1NDR4NC3: Even in raids, i've gotten like 4 pieces of loot out of all the weeks of boss kills
[3:17:09] CallMeWallie: Are you snowed in @towelliee -San?
[3:17:16] furansowah: At this point I feel like blizzard dont have to add anima rewards until the end of expansion.... all the stuff that's there is gonna take years to unlock at this rate LUL
[3:17:17] Affiiance: I think its pretty good, you can fail M+ and still get loot. If you fail in PvP your Rating doesnt move
[3:17:23] SeleneVoelkerVT: I just spent all mine on my tier 3 conservatory
[3:17:47] deckardblade: the problem is if blizz doesn't make any changes for another 4 months its gonna be too late
[3:17:50] exhale1995: @towelliee I'm using sotr leggo, which one do you run?
[3:18:00] Tyr7: How does Asmon manage to get carried for Glad mount everytime
[3:18:02] Mystirose: Mystirose subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:18:25] aimassistallen: Bc asmon has 70k watching him
[3:18:27] Affiiance: Theres always some group saying something is bad and if they dont fix the game is doomed, just happens to be Dungeon players right now
[3:18:27] SeleneVoelkerVT: cause its asmon Kappa
[3:18:40] PadidinJones: Hey no yeet! That takes skillz yo

[3:19:40] peinen: boomy on ST is nuts
[3:19:48] kamikazis: that was sexy tell me more
[3:20:00] SeleneVoelkerVT: at least I got my leggo maxed at tier 4. I'm deciding if i wanna get a pvp leggo done next
[3:20:20] Affiiance: That MM Hunter scaling is about to kick in with the gear we are getting and they gonna fall off a cliff

[3:22:09] Affiiance: @jure__ Rogue, Mage Priest
[3:22:13] aimassistallen: How would you like if you complete a dungeon at 10 and it’s you’re weekly vault and you get to choose between 2 pieces of the dungeon instead of a random piece being in the vault ?
[3:22:19] KronasKG: Preach is working on a "RPG Through the ages" Video. SO he is starting with cronotrigger
[3:22:39] Amarlian: I dont know, Chrono trigger isn't on every system. just SNES, Nintendo DS, Mobile and PC but those last too are more recent
[3:22:45] Lemonmunch3r: 95

[3:22:57] magemaster225: FFIV-FFVI
[3:23:00] Scarhearth: M+ makes me depressed as a primarily M+ player. I dont like Raid or die or PvP or die for my gear right now i did 7/10 heroic(thats including SLG and Sire) and i got 0 loot. Its just not a great feeling right now this expansion from gear drops
[3:23:07] robertjordan83: FF3/VI
[3:23:08] Fisch317: @Towelliee did you see the rumors of turning toon into your cov as the new allied race options? Would you do it?

[3:23:34] paradoxTheDJ: bmac6996 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 72 months, currently on a 31 month streak! Yep
[3:23:36] Sollice: @Fisch317 Those aren't rumors lol. That's what someone who is in T&E guild said would be cool
[3:23:37] Amarlian: Lufia II is the real sleeper RPG for the SNES
[3:23:40] Hybridwarhawk: FF VI and FFIV are bangers as well
[3:23:40] Doomedsaint: YOOOO Xenogears > FF VII
[3:23:45] kamikazis: ff9 was good
[3:23:51] Spaede: Legend of Legia was sick on PS1 too
[3:23:53] monkeyarmz: Legend of Dragoon was good too
[3:23:56] Hybridwarhawk: Lufia are also amazing games too. SNES had some insane RPGS
[3:23:58] xXSiebzehnXx: Star Ocean the second story POG
[3:24:04] Fisch317: @Fisch317 would be sick though, could work. and makes sense

[3:24:26] Mecabeast: so was chrono the precursor to dragon quest
[3:24:43] aimassistallen: @scarhearth So last week I did 10/10 normal, 15 dungeons, and all my honor for pvp gear. Got maybe 1 upgrade in all the dungeons. None in raid and my best simed piece from vault was a 216 when I had 8 10s done

[3:26:02] Amarlian: Dragon Quarter is Breath of Fire @Towelliee
[3:26:03] Affiiance: See this is the difference in PvE and PvP, Towel can do the highest level M+ and read chat the whole time. You cant do that in even mid level PvP
[3:26:05] Mecabeast: @amarlian interesting art work looked the similar so thought it was
[3:26:18] Clicklesly: The prideful route here is pretty weird iirc, have to pull the first pack of one wing and then skip a mob in another ^^
[3:26:19] DoubleNova: I couldn't get into the Tales games personally
[3:26:28] FenrisFhaust: Im old... Dragon Warrior... origional NES
[3:26:58] SeleneVoelkerVT: I have over 1000 hours in tales of symphonia and abyss
[3:27:06] Amarlian: @Mecabeast ah so Chrono Trigger has the same artist as the DQ series. Also the same dude for Dragon Ball series. so that is why they look similar

[3:27:07] Maligus: ugh Tales of symphonia was difficult for me

[3:27:29] DoubleNova: yeah i remember when star ocean 4 came out and was super disappointed
[3:27:39] Mecabeast: I missed out only snes games I had for awhile was link to the past, super Mario world and donkey kong country
[3:28:01] Amarlian: Super Mario RPG has a great charm to it

[3:28:34] SeleneVoelkerVT: last tales I played was the one with Milla Maxwell

[3:31:35] Amarlian: it's easy to do. just look for the vitahacks subreddit
[3:31:40] Alienfromger: good old days with pirate games LUL
[3:31:57] paradoxTheDJ: STACK 4 sure
[3:31:59] shimwood: def stack
[3:32:00] Amarlian: Then you can get a sd to vita memory card adapter and you are golden
[3:32:00] zachwho: they suppose to stack
[3:32:02] Scarhearth: its better to stack..
[3:32:02] jeneraljelly: stack if affix allows it

[3:38:22] 2chest_1head: they already nerfed it for pvp
[3:38:36] xideontv: 20% isnt a nerf when it crits for 30k
[3:38:42] Wildside1177: @2chest_1head A teeny weeny tiny nerf yes.

[3:44:23] cubfucious: @Towelliee was fun in the key (the warlock) thought i scuffed it for a second when i got yeeted haha
[3:44:26] magemaster225: d2 remaster might come out as surprise announement with them merging that other studio
[3:44:32] Bonedit: OW2

[3:45:08] northcub: people are impatient
[3:45:13] Koravd: Im ejoying Shadowlands a lot i dont want a new xpac yet tbh
[3:45:15] DraOmz: @Towelliee haha it was a joke ^^ think this exp is fun
[3:45:16] ice_ross: will the next expansion have loot?
[3:45:22] Affiiance: I just think its funny, the numbers probably say otherwise. This expansion is probably killing it
[3:45:30] Secondbreakfasttt: i need loot do not need another exp.
[3:45:37] mrbzombie: feb 19th
[3:45:37] thiccsushi: probably next feb
[3:45:39] Armdel: last blizzcon got canned so they are doing a mini one now
[3:45:50] Syllvn: We wont see a Bcon until 2022
[3:46:05] Koravd: HE KNOWS
[3:46:10] SeleneVoelkerVT: if vaccine distribution goes right everyone SHOULD have the vaccine in the US by october
[3:46:14] GarfielfArbuncle: I just hope they show off draenei and troll heritage armor later this month.
[3:46:15] kodtheog: i think this expansion started out killing it and died down fast
[3:46:21] happyspot: Problem is even if US is in an ok place by then planning/insurance/logistics uncertainty may prevent it
[3:46:28] spoda: seems like wow gets more and more worse every year
[3:46:30] Rudric_Ice: where are the blizzcon goodies the virtual goodies i mean ?
[3:46:30] Affiiance: Yeah no matter what at this point in the expansion they lose some
[3:46:31] Sandman_88: cant be on top forever
[3:46:34] Thoreya: idk its past 2 months and i still see places in wow packed
[3:46:39] Thoreya: oribos is lit always
[3:46:40] stjon13: they need to do one on east coast
[3:46:47] TheOGMed: TheOGMed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[3:46:49] cyberratt: I think SL was overhyped because 8.3 was such a clusterfuck. Now we have new stuff but it's replayability is abysmal
[3:46:49] kamikazis: whats killing it is, having to pvp... so you can pve
[3:46:51] xideontv: did you update venture plan?
[3:47:02] Sandman_88: of course not, they greedy af
[3:47:03] xideontv: UPDATE VENTURE PLAN!!!!!!
[3:47:10] Syllvn: I think the game is fine, as long as they announce updates/fixes to the issues people are seeing it will stay strong
[3:47:13] SeleneVoelkerVT: what addon is that command board again? I used to have it
[3:47:21] Hitmanblood: what addon was that
[3:47:25] Affiiance: You have to remember theres an entire player base of super casuals we never interact with
[3:47:28] shutyourface: dailys seem almost pointless lately
[3:47:28] Hitmanblood: for table
[3:47:29] humbaby_: I'm loving this expansion...haven't had this much since WotLK
[3:47:41] Rudric_Ice: many people hate this expansion bcuz of loot scarcity which i can understand
[3:47:47] Scarhearth: ive been tempted to unsub because of how bad M+ gearing is forcing pvp or raiding
[3:47:51] humbaby_: *fun
[3:47:56] spoda: im done with wow fore least 6 months
[3:47:58] xideontv: @Towelliee venture plan was updated last night
[3:48:05] xideontv: yes
[3:48:09] Kinghorn: you think you get loot from raiding Scarhearth LUL
[3:48:11] kodtheog: i think this expac is great but the great problem is a major issue and weird how long its taken to fixx
[3:48:21] Wildside1177: @Scarhearth I am with you. I am awaiting New World and AoC - they might be good.
[3:48:24] dimofodi: Done with it itself but you still do the events for the Grateful Offerings.
[3:48:27] kodtheog: gear*
[3:48:27] GarfielfArbuncle: Surely 9.1 will be out around when we hit renown 40 yeah?
[3:48:30] TheUnknowing: Even raid gearing is very bad, you feel forced to PVP even with raiding @Scarhearth
[3:48:37] Mecabeast: I heard there's been frustrations for ember court
[3:48:38] GarfielfArbuncle: Even if it's just a mini patch with a mega dungeon.
[3:48:45] Koravd: Sloot scarcity can be fixed, i believe there are no major problems to fix like in BFA imo
[3:48:45] mrpresbaby: is back piece boss a daily thing?

[3:51:17] Thoreya: yikes
[3:51:20] tacsquatch: screw having to pvp
[3:51:26] aloken1312: Farming dungeons for valor gear would be POG
[3:51:32] Indy_VT: This expansion got me to finally play pvp and really enjoyed it (so far lol)
[3:51:44] smashwow: pvp with this damn "one-shot" meta and having no gear is ass
[3:51:44] GarfielfArbuncle: @Towelliee You think they'll do anything to fix the gear droughts for PVE? Maybe bring back badges or just increase drop rates?
[3:51:45] jure__: just like PVPrs dont want to do PVE to improve, PVErs dont want to do PVP to improve
[3:51:46] mrniceguy817: I hate pvp and my gears shows it
[3:51:47] Affiiance: People always like the path of least resistance
[3:51:51] shutyourface: i hate pvp this expansion
[3:51:52] Moiste: i think they shouldve brought back pvp stats
[3:51:55] kamikazis: agree with toweliee 100%
[3:52:00] Moiste: keep pve and pvp gear separate
[3:52:00] Zhiovanni: I remember the farm for trinkets at end of legion, loved that
[3:52:03] LoremasterMarthan: Valor vendor, with Anima used like conquest to upgrade the ilvl of gear like they have set with Covenant armor already
[3:52:07] jake_lampy: What about the pvp'ers that dislike the PVE BS of "farming" and WQ? For PvP'ers this is the best xpac yet
[3:52:14] bmartinez50: Hey anyway an nfl player can get a 15+ carry I need the mount!!
[3:52:17] fistofnature: Soul ash Pog
[3:52:20] ZabberzTV: bring back valor
[3:52:21] Thoreya: the torghast shit is insane
[3:52:21] thiccsushi: I just hope they dont scrap the valor system if they bring it back next expac
[3:52:22] jeneraljelly: I dont think theyll add back an old system they already removed
[3:52:22] shutyourface: yeah soul ash and done for the week
[3:52:24] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: I would rather run Islands than do callings tbh
[3:52:24] Thoreya: idk how its so bland
[3:52:29] Thoreya: BFA POG
[3:52:32] DonAndolini: im new to wow and i find it really annoying to have to pvp, i've leveled my first toon, got full normal dungeon gear, then full heroic dungeon gear and wouldnt make the cut to raid or do m+ so i had to pvp to fill the gap, and its really frustrating cause i hate pvping
[3:52:35] Wcvechten: Pog
[3:52:39] Kinghorn: to the vindicaar!
[3:52:44] mrniceguy817: @lampy_ow Do you think the majority of wow player base is pvp focused or pve?
[3:52:47] GarfielfArbuncle: DansGame
[3:52:48] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: pls no
[3:52:50] Secondbreakfasttt: towRee

[3:52:55] jeneraljelly: oh nononono lmao
[3:52:56] mopymop_: Woohoo
[3:52:57] thiccsushi: I'd play legion
[3:52:59] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: legion wasnt that bad.but bfa..sucked
[3:53:00] Secondbreakfasttt: i'm down for legion tho
[3:53:01] jeneraljelly: legion classic yes please
[3:53:01] Bleusempai: @fourteenfour i think that's the issue. it's a cool thing to do, not cool that it's mandatory
[3:53:05] MuttonChopins: MOP Classic When
[3:53:05] garkhyt: BFA classic 2035
[3:53:11] Bahamut145: I'd be so down for legion
[3:53:13] D3m0nHunt3r666: we are getting legion classic after Wrath Kappa
[3:53:17] balanira: any content is not enjoyable if its forced ... if u force a pver to pvp he will 100% hate it and vice versa
[3:53:19] Thoreya: i actually fuck with SL heavy the gear thing isnt too much of a problem for me thankfully
[3:53:19] kodtheog: i still think mop is so underrated in expansion tier list
[3:53:22] Teyren: Loved me some legion
[3:53:26] jake_lampy: @mrniceguy817 no i know they're not mostly pvp... maybe because we have been forced into pve constantly?
[3:53:30] jeneraljelly: are you gonna try TBC classic?
[3:53:30] Rudric_Ice: WE WOD CLASSIC
[3:53:34] Scarhearth: id love bfa again but let me play vulpera from the start

[3:53:44] Kinghorn: I quit because of that patch
[3:53:45] LuxVulpes: I actually liked MoP haha
[3:53:45] kamikazis: wrath classic
[3:53:46] Bahamut145: Indeed
[3:53:50] Affiiance: Ewww I quit during Naz and Mechagon
[3:53:53] Kinghorn: nazjatar was horrible
[3:53:53] jure__: and the reason were the meta achievs
[3:53:54] Akoudadis: I feel like taking a break from wow! I ll come back for .1 ;) Meanwhile @Towelliee you will cover my need for wow :D
[3:53:54] verm1111: fuck the maw
[3:53:54] shutyourface: maw
[3:53:56] Thoreya: i mean thats unfair
[3:53:56] Kinghorn: HORRIBLE
[3:53:59] D3m0nHunt3r666: hell no
[3:53:59] Klauzzer: the maw 100%

[3:54:04] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: Suramar <3
[3:54:05] D3m0nHunt3r666: I rather do naz
[3:54:06] zulway_: suramar
[3:54:06] thiccsushi: suramar
[3:54:07] shutyourface: najatar sucked
[3:54:08] kodtheog: no the maw is so unrewarding fuck that
[3:54:08] LuxVulpes: Suramar deffo
[3:54:09] luckfore: SURAMAR <3
[3:54:09] maccaruso: i LOVE Suramar
[3:54:09] alluza: suramar for sure
[3:54:10] Roughneck124: I think what would be cool as in your covenant area, The vendors that drop the Raid weapons and gear I think should be used with anima. I think that would be way better
[3:54:11] LeBigNose: suramaw
[3:54:12] kodtheog: suramar
[3:54:12] plumpus81: Something is not quite right in both places/.
[3:54:12] Bahamut145: Suramar deff
[3:54:14] CatOf9Lives: Surmar > maw > naj
[3:54:14] Thoreya: nazjatar sucked btw too
[3:54:19] mrpresbaby: suramar
[3:54:21] TSquadSully: suramar for sure
[3:54:21] Affiiance: You have a point there... The Maw is trash
[3:54:22] zulway_: suramar was such a beatiful zone
[3:54:24] luckfore: Maw is the worst zone ever
[3:54:25] Teyren: @LuxVulpes I agree, was beautiful
[3:54:28] shutyourface: naw it's not that bad
[3:54:29] GarfielfArbuncle: I think they're going to abandon it.
[3:54:30] fistofnature: Layer 8 mount :)
[3:54:32] Durithane: Suramar is awsomee
[3:54:32] Kinghorn: maw > nazjatar 10000000%
[3:54:32] Rudric_Ice: Suramar is 100 times better
[3:54:33] Bleusempai: it really does tho
[3:54:34] kodtheog: maw is literally so boring
[3:54:36] LeBigNose: Teyren you beautiful
[3:54:38] bmi86: @Towelliee you didnt need to grind useless boring contend for 18 hours just to mount in suramar
[3:54:40] kodtheog: like i cannot how boring it is
[3:54:42] brandon_tapartos: Maw blowd
[3:54:47] TSquadSully: nazjatar sucked but i would still take that over the maw
[3:54:49] Rudric_Ice: MAW is ACTUALLY HELL
[3:54:51] shutyourface: maw is fine, it's the no mount shit people hate
[3:54:55] Minoumi: Waw vs Tanaan jungle ?
[3:54:55] Teyren: @LeBigNose so are you
[3:54:57] thiccsushi: That conduit rng roll is brutal for druids man
[3:55:00] LoremasterMarthan: Well and thats the problem right, the Maw has the issue of BY DESIGN, it is extremely finite for what they could do to "progress" it. Suramar and Naz were an open playground of a zone, Maw isnt
[3:55:06] Affiiance: Even with the mount I barely do the Maw
[3:55:06] SeleneVoelkerVT: once i get the two mounts,venari rep done and torghast done I'm done with the maw once I get all possible sockets done xD
[3:55:13] raptorstrick: I effin hate the maw
[3:55:15] Klauzzer: the maw is supposed to be a shitty place to be. its shadowlands hell
[3:55:17] Rudric_Ice: Imagine IF they actually finished WOD WITH CLASSIC WOD

[3:55:33] Rudric_Ice: best expansion ever
[3:55:37] shutyourface: you realize that voice actor is ana from overwatch?
[3:55:44] Affiiance: I think the dreary aesthetics just make it unfun to be there
[3:55:47] Kinghorn: I just do my weekly quests and the events in the maw and I am done. aint doing those dailies even with the mount
[3:55:55] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: I got to cordial on my main and have never touched the maw outside of the weekly souls rescue
[3:55:59] Bernardo994: maw just not fun
[3:56:06] Secondbreakfasttt: maybe just me but i do not like Maw layer desgn too, it seems to be a lazzy desing dunno
[3:56:08] daniel85mg: @shutyourface the vendor voice is her?
[3:56:13] shutyourface: yes
[3:56:15] maccaruso: We still have one section of the Beastwarren we have not unlocked
[3:56:17] zaraine1: beastwarrens is the worst imo
[3:56:17] Mecabeast: never doing torghast solo again after doing it in a 5 man
[3:56:23] Zmaychek: I hate Maw and Torghast
[3:56:37] Scarhearth: no back piece saaaad
[3:56:45] ZabberzTV: man what if doing layer 8 we got some anima
[3:56:54] Affiiance: Literally just give the Maw any of the other zones Aesthetics and people wouldnt hate it as much
[3:57:00] Xellana287: I love maw and Torghast. It's sooo much better than visions or islands
[3:57:01] Kinghorn: 25 anima PogChamp ZabberzTV
[3:57:04] Kinghorn: 35*
[3:57:17] mobbo: Only part I hate about the Maw is doing the same route when I am there each day
[3:57:19] xideontv: I tried to get in there, there is an invisible debuff that kills you in 8 secs and elites 1 shot you
[3:57:22] MOLAR305: if you connect realms you should be able to trade with those
[3:57:27] Bl4ckSauce: sks
[3:57:31] LeBigNose: here we go
[3:57:34] Mecabeast: why not have a shit tonight of anima available in the maw and torghast cause thats where it's all going
[3:57:34] Ogumel: You''ve now jinxed it
[3:57:42] cabalish: nice song
[3:57:50] Korupcija_: he is probably opening the stream
[3:57:52] Mecabeast: *shit ton
[3:58:05] zulway_: is it just me or are wow tokens not selling at all?
[3:58:08] MOLAR305: that was more of overall not specific to yoy
[3:58:16] Rudric_Ice: Hey Tow honest question do you really like to do m+ ?

[3:58:57] kowaikoro: 155 ilvl KEKW
[3:59:05] SeleneVoelkerVT: I need to get a group together for rare hunts in SL
[3:59:15] kodtheog: i feel like blizzard gettin lazy with this xpac
[3:59:23] LoremasterMarthan: THe mentality of "you are gonna need to be like 180ish+ to be able to do this stuff, but the rewards are gonna be 155"
[3:59:28] Fatpally: o/
[3:59:32] PhillyDilly18: Is it laziness or Covid? Both?
[3:59:35] Fatpally: salude
[3:59:39] luckfore: monkaS
[3:59:41] 3dRes: towJesus bless you towJesus
[3:59:42] Kromede: monkaSoap
[3:59:49] kodtheog: tons of games are doing fun despite covid so i dont think blizzard can use the whole covid excuse that much longer
[3:59:53] kodtheog: fine*
[3:59:58] Freakzene: Feels like everything is blamed on covid, and I have my doubts on that
[4:00:00] mrniceguy817: Lay of blizzard guys multi dollar company hard to maintain all these issues
[4:00:12] Roughneck124: Is it me or are those vendors in your covenant worthless....
[4:00:19] kodtheog: @Roughneck124 not just you
[4:00:21] Xellana287: @kaeod since when is WoW not doing fine. Shadowlands is amazing
[4:00:28] GoGetItKo: @Roughneck124 cosmetics though man! Kappa
[4:00:39] SeleneVoelkerVT: vendors for covenant for me are just for the mogs for me xD
[4:00:43] kodtheog: @Xellana287 thats a very subjective statement
[4:00:44] Kromede: 4WD
[4:00:45] Korupcija_: class balance ruined the dungeons as well
[4:00:51] TheUnknowing: It feels bad doing m+ cause of rewards but the dungeons are fun
[4:00:52] Fatpally: so i decided to dabble with heals last night had a good first dungeon
[4:00:55] Roughneck124: why don’t they just use anima to be able to get that gear
[4:00:56] kodtheog: do a 15 key and get no loot for sweating ur ass off then come back to me
[4:00:59] RodneyIsPro: @kaeod so whas yours...
[4:00:59] balanira: i liked legion dungeons more but maybe im bias because m+ was new at that time

[4:02:40] kodtheog: @RodneyIsPro and thats fine but just because one person enjoys it doesnt mean we are all enjoying i tihnk the hype is dying down and the big issues are starting to show badly

[4:03:30] Thoreya: twitch numbers are all up for wow streamers too
[4:03:33] Thoreya: way more than bfa
[4:03:44] RodneyIsPro: @kaeod take wow out of the equation. you made a statement. then he did. then you said his is subjective. well so was your statement.
[4:04:04] kodtheog: nah deff dont think bfa was better i like shadowlands more just have some annoyances with some of the current system
[4:04:12] Thoreya: all pvp and pve streamers get signifcantly more than bfa
[4:04:18] Thoreya: esp like snowmixy and gingi
[4:04:26] bec0o: where is asmond he quit??
[4:04:33] Thoreya: cdew

[4:04:49] bec0o: oh i see
[4:04:56] luckfore: the law mitchD

[4:05:22] Thoreya: thats more than bfa
[4:05:31] godgwen: yeah more like a viewer shift
[4:05:41] thiccsushi: @Thoriakk His guild would expect you to play the meta of your class
[4:05:45] Wildside1177: Yes exactly.
[4:05:56] RodneyIsPro: people are coming up in pvp now streaming 2800+ arenas
[4:06:03] Lazugo: https://clips.twitch.tv/DifferentCredulousSangAliens I finally clipped this
[4:06:04] balanira: max streams popped of but mainly because of RWF more than SL
[4:06:18] RodneyIsPro: actually its just old faces getting big again
[4:06:26] Korupcija_: you can do it towelliee
[4:06:43] Armdel: pretty common to give the tank lead for marks
[4:07:05] MysticalOS: nah, wow always has downtime
[4:07:15] RodneyIsPro: its hard to get new people to play wow 2
[4:07:24] MysticalOS: only so many times yuo can see same thing. then it dies down until new things
[4:07:25] Thoreya: naguuras stream has also popped off with SL
[4:07:29] Thoreya: forgot her too
[4:07:32] kodtheog: @RodneyIsPro agreed
[4:07:51] Mecabeast: people don't watch for wow they watch to listen
[4:08:00] RodneyIsPro: while they play wow lol
[4:08:08] snoopy123lol: is there a reason to take raid talents to dungeon?
[4:08:09] tacsquatch: naguura is also very good natured most times and upbeat so it helps a lot and on top is just a good player. its a good combo
[4:08:09] 24sevn: have you watched preach video on how many people are doing m+ compared to bfa?
[4:08:13] MuttonChopins: I consider WoW channels as a podcast or radio show type of thing cause of the streamers
[4:08:32] MysticalOS: 24 i imagine the tldr of it is a lot less are doing it and a lot more are doing pvp
[4:08:41] letrickyxd: Bolster makes every week shit
[4:08:47] kodtheog: this week is rough
[4:08:52] letrickyxd: Bolster is not a fun affix

[4:10:01] taylerjayy: @Towelliee were you doing rbgs last night?
[4:10:01] ThatGuyFayde: boltering isnt that bad, bursting is worst grievous too
[4:10:12] Scarhearth: i miss skittish and teeming now
[4:10:14] letrickyxd: all skittish was, was "hold CDs for 2-3 GCDs so tank gets aggro", wasn't anything lmao

[5:15:31] Puepe: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect i main resto druid too, you need to coordinate cd's with him, what i did was have one 1 dps and myself taunt each one boss, let the tank reset stacks and we gucci

[5:22:51] I_DoctorSatan_I: yea, but im BM, just...losing hope for the spec at this point. Hopefully, the "real" class tuning after AWC and MDI for 9.1 will make em better
[5:22:57] noobreignz: only sad part is that feral is good, but to compete they HAVE to take Night fae for convoke
[5:23:41] metavahn231: what does that lantern thing do
[5:23:43] Affiiance: Why would you ever not want to take Convoke though lol
[5:24:02] Affiiance: Convoke is like the funnest Spell in the game right now

[5:26:27] mmrghost7: yeah only problem was first boss tyranical its ok now

[5:28:03] motorboatingpro: @I_DoctorSatan_I yeah, I really disliked that leggo when i made it. It's game play is rough.

[5:39:38] JBruz: Do you ever get denied is the real question
[5:40:12] siradonis1: Drust do it
[5:40:19] Swiftie0: damn!
[5:40:37] Swiftie0: the campaign is so time consuming on alts its difficult to power through IMO
[5:40:43] MysticalOS: renound is easy part, it's anima and mission table progress that fucks youo
[5:40:43] silverfang28: Bwamsamdi is a cool character :) I love him xD hehe
[5:40:46] MysticalOS: when swappig
[5:41:00] thebakeriscomingforu: the drust story will only pay off if Thros is added to the game.
[5:41:18] silverfang28: might have spelled his name wrong though

[5:41:48] Athaeln: I could see a Drust raid in Ardenwald
[5:41:56] pavepawns: its weird for once i actually like the dungeons (except plaguefall) at the start of an expansion

[5:41:58] thebakeriscomingforu: Thros is where the drust come from. So if there is a raid, then it could definitely be there
[5:42:07] elitepower97: KAPOW
[5:42:22] MysticalOS: the whole of drustvar ended anticlimatically
[5:42:32] Mecabeast: 9.1 dust raid in ardenweld
[5:42:36] MysticalOS: huge lore connection to jaina, but then just kinda wrapped up in a 5 man?
[5:42:58] metavahn231: i still stand that bfa had better dungo's
[5:43:18] tekfury: I think legion had the best dungeons
[5:43:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: I think when the Broker area becomes available, we might see Alliera Windrunner. The Brokers are into the "void" magic as well. Makes you wonder, don't it?
[5:43:53] Thoreya: im in long island

[5:44:06] Mecabeast: we got hit with a couple in of snow last night
[5:44:09] Molvonos: @I_DoctorSatan_I I don't get any void vibes from any of the brokers. Even the dungeon/raid bosses don't use void energies.
[5:44:10] Djaygam3s: @Towelliee I have about 2 feet here in PA

[5:45:07] Freakzene: size*
[5:45:12] metavahn231: shadowbringers is good just lots of story at the start

[5:45:26] Reap14: Shadowbringers is the best mmo expansion hands down
[5:45:28] HunterDeLupin: @kevbeani3 same here but all ive seen is like 3-5 inches then rain for hours
[5:45:32] Armdel: i hit max level, finished the story of the first patch and then quit
[5:45:32] Blackmarsh: Shadowlands had amazing story, best FF story in ages
[5:45:33] Gargeth: We got like 10 inches here in Northern IL. When I cleaned my car off it was faster than I thought it was. Shit just slid off.
[5:45:36] brewsephtv: Lusting this first trash pack all depends on your dps
[5:45:40] tenassity69: @Towelliee yes you lust first pack and have it by next boss
[5:45:40] Nehcrom: The shadowbringer story is dope.
[5:45:42] Emerge: you need lust for haikar, if the dps is too good at the start you may have to wait
[5:45:45] Blackmarsh: Shadowbringers*
[5:45:59] brewsephtv: I've definitely lusted this trash pack and got to hakkar with 40% pride before lust was back up in a 13
[5:45:59] Reap14: Well its ffxiv. Its story first always.
[5:46:05] YardRage: ResidentSleeper
[5:46:10] metavahn231: most endgame players just skip teh story lol
[5:46:14] Nocteres: luck
[5:46:38] Freakzene: Dont quite like the artstyle of ffxiv, wouldve tried it othervice
[5:46:39] dinobille: DoritosChip DoritosChip
[5:46:52] brewsephtv: oh no. That's a big boi right there. Mega monkaS
[5:47:02] melariah: PogChamp
[5:47:03] Reap14: You don't like ffxiv art style but you like WoW? You have bad taste man.
[5:47:14] Freakzene: Cant help it dude lol
[5:47:22] Molvonos: @Reap14 Cause opinions arent a thing.
[5:47:24] Noshpan: I like both WoW's & 14's art style
[5:47:33] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Molvonos Maybe they haven't shown us their full potential. Remember, Ti'or is FULL of Void magic and it were the Brokers who captured Ti'or. Also, the quest line to unlock "Bet on Yourself" in Maldraxxus has you port to another realm that mimics the "void" world.
[5:47:38] amuhk: Moin Meister :D
[5:47:41] Rakim88: oh shit didnt notice that hunter is survival PogChamp
[5:47:42] Freakzene: I've enjoyed some older asian and pixel style mmos though
[5:47:45] Warcried: Just came out of a 14 dos, look up. you're doing it rofl
[5:47:48] Reap14: People are welcome to like whatever I just don't personally get it
[5:47:56] falldrgn: well FFXIV is the OG final fantasy style. IMO. it works for the world its in
[5:48:22] Molvonos: @I_DoctorSatan_I Yes, but the brokers deal with anything and everything that can provide them with revenue. Just because they can handle void energies doesnt mean they're void entities. That same questline has them dealing with nature and fel energies too.

[5:49:40] goosselol: why do i suck at feral so much. does feral suck in general?
[5:49:46] Redr0ok: necrotic is stinky
[5:49:49] dutchie76: Hey Rob
[5:50:11] Redr0ok: but kyrian brew makes it so much easier
[5:50:12] dutchie76: 19 moar days till blizzcon online!
[5:50:33] IxProNoobxI: @goosselol Feral isn't bad, they are top 6 dps in mythic CN, its just a steep learning curve
[5:50:36] brewsephtv: What's necrotic? I'm a dark iron and I just use fireblood to drop it :P
[5:50:50] Redr0ok: that works too
[5:51:03] dutchie76: uh oh leaks?
[5:51:03] Molvonos: @brewsephtv Once every what, five minutes? You must not time many keys then. towDerp
[5:51:06] Noshpan: @goosselol Feral has always had a steep learning curve.
[5:51:22] goosselol: I've noticed >_<
[5:51:32] tacofury2: when do they normally add a 2nd raid to expansions?
[5:51:36] MysticalOS: wrath of the selfie cam
[5:51:37] dutchie76: yea
[5:51:39] metavahn231: diablo 4 more hype than anything wow
[5:51:40] brewsephtv: @Molvonos Fireblood is every 2 minutes. Shorter CD than phial lol.
[5:51:46] dutchie76: LUL

[5:52:47] ElDiablo420tv: Anyone know the max renown for this week is it 28?
[5:53:00] Kael88: Diablo on our phones POGGERS
[5:53:08] IxProNoobxI: 28 is max
[5:53:13] ChaoticPriest: Titan Quest came out on mobiles though. Next best thing
[5:53:15] MysticalOS: I just want to know when we can fly
[5:53:22] MysticalOS: if they aren't ever giving us a whistle, i want to fly
[5:53:22] PrimalRain: blizzcon will be ow2 release date then probably immortal as well
[5:53:24] goosselol: I feel like Ferla has SO many buttons / keybinds and need to look everywhere. either that or im used to classic too much
[5:53:34] ElDiablo420tv: @IxProNoobxI thank you i thought so :D
[5:53:58] Garrujak: I think it would be wise for Blizz to drop info on Diablo 4 and also drop Immortal on the app store. This way they can take advantage of the hype and spike the app
[5:54:18] KillPhill_KP: @Towelliee The hunter in group has poor taste of music
[5:55:01] Redr0ok: daddy wants a mount
[5:55:04] idenkaz_: a pet Kappa

[5:56:06] KillPhill_KP: @Towelliee Repeat after me, "Maxh thinks eminem is a good rapper omegalul"
[5:56:18] metavahn231: why do tanks never join halls of attonement
[5:56:27] Redr0ok: halls?
[5:56:30] Redr0ok: thats an easy one idk
[5:56:47] I_DoctorSatan_I: If we were able to fly in BFA during patch 8.1, i'd imagine SL would follow suit, but, instead of rep requirements, i might be locked behind Renown rank.
[5:56:48] Redr0ok: honestly my fav other than mists
[5:56:50] mobbo: They hate the dogs maybe?
[5:56:51] Redr0ok: maybe the hounds

[5:59:00] mmrghost7: melee will get benched this week
[5:59:07] borisdic: 100% ^^
[5:59:08] blockbot1994: thats every week almost lol
[5:59:11] dutchie76: next week is Tyrannical, bursting, grevious
[5:59:12] PidiaP: Imagine playing melee towLul
[5:59:19] hgizaira: melee is discriminated every week LUL
[5:59:25] Affiiance: As the MDI teams run Double Melee all the time. Its fine for Melee in dungeons
[5:59:28] xXSiebzehnXx: Which is why I started leveling a mage. Melee getting shit on this expac
[5:59:28] I_DoctorSatan_I: good think ill be running +7 keys on my Fury Warrior 4Head
[5:59:44] Redr0ok: youre still fucked this week
[5:59:49] Redr0ok: no matter who you bring lmao
[5:59:55] Affiiance: As a WW Monk I have never had an issue in dungeons. Even with Storming and Spiteful
[6:00:11] dutchie76: Tyrannical, bursting, grevious
[6:00:12] hoodvoker: Bursting / Explosive
[6:00:22] Affiiance: Melee dont have to cast so we are gonna pump more than casters that might have to stop casting
[6:00:22] hgizaira: you say that but pugs don't really care if you're fine. they want range specially mage and boomy only
[6:00:23] dutchie76: errr explosive
[6:00:26] bosseja: melee just pops like popcorn in storming lol
[6:00:28] D3m0nHunt3r666: storming is just annoying
[6:00:34] Marokkolin: next week is free man
[6:00:37] Redr0ok: i want quaking again
[6:00:37] D3m0nHunt3r666: spiteful is just aids ruyuLUL
[6:00:43] Affiiance: Most Boomies in 14 and below keys are garbage
[6:00:44] TheCliffyShow: As a melee I'm suing for discrimination.
[6:00:53] Redr0ok: the new quaking is so easy
[6:00:55] mobbo: Tyrannical Bursting Explosive is one of the best Tyrannical weeks you could ask for
[6:01:13] MysticalOS: I still think they need to add a Defiling affix. every time a mob dies it drops Defile on ground, complete with same expanding mechanic as lich king :)
[6:01:14] bosseja: @D3m0nHunt3r666 furry emote bruuhh
[6:01:26] D3m0nHunt3r666: @felipe_bosseljon_ ruyuWat
[6:01:27] mobbo: Bursting Volcanic (week 1) is the best week
[6:01:35] redtemplar88: Looks like I'll be leveling my Balance druid so I can actually do keys this expansion
[6:01:37] I_DoctorSatan_I: Hey Blizzard, can we get Tyranical, Bolstering and Grevious please!! 4Head Jebaited

[6:24:28] propoopimus: yea 216 for a 15 is reasonable
[6:24:51] TheCliffyShow: Anyone who rolls 69 should automatically win.
[6:24:51] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: thats why i say if ur not pushing 15s its useless to run m+
[6:25:02] Urebaldd: I assume so, they will have to change the ilevel in the near future
[6:25:19] theaccountant219: theaccountant2192 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[6:25:32] blazeofhell: well, its hard to optimize for raid when m+ doesn't drop you items
[6:25:32] Kael88: I would be okay if we had valor points to upgrade that 207/210 loot to 226
[6:25:43] gold9871: goes up from 184 -> 197 worldquest rewards.
[6:25:46] RogueBear: yeah the problem with M+ is the gear you get from it isnt worth it because it takes better gear than what drops to do the content
[6:25:46] knightlight_89: meanwhile you can PVP for 220 gear without effort
[6:25:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: its the drop rate.
[6:25:55] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: and tbh heroic raids are easyer then m+10-14
[6:26:06] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: unless u wau out gear the lvl
[6:26:09] ursinealli: It's the fact that it's BOTH reduced drop rate and reduced ilvl together that make it bad.
[6:26:10] I_DoctorSatan_I: im cool with getting 220-223 gear though. Im not trying to min/max myself in a 9.0 patch LUL
[6:26:10] Puepe: what is that foodie @Towelliee ? ConcernDoge
[6:26:13] D3m0nHunt3r666: getting nothing to complete +14 its just plain dumb
[6:26:15] Elzz: they need to up the anima to mythic 250 for anything above a +12
[6:26:40] propoopimus: yea the anima should scale by key level just like artifact power did
[6:26:45] Urebaldd: Justice or valor or increased drops, something needs to happen
[6:26:52] Affiiance: It is content you can literally fail and still get loot

[7:57:32] bec0o: just lowkey
[7:57:32] P4RT1CLEM4N: Is he not getting stacks of necrotic here?
[7:57:38] bec0o: the dungs and raids are amazing
[7:57:47] Crowzcut: microsoft bought 7.5bil they still waiting for eu to say yes
[7:58:16] TheCliffyShow: Maybe on Twitch but ZOS puts most of the work on PvE stuff. At least, when I was playing.
[7:58:44] Trawkey: Trawkey subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 77 months! 
[7:58:45] MrLoops: Alcast streams ESO raids but that's about it. It is very Cyro heavy

[7:58:52] junkrat_sky: you know it is a slow news day when Global Wrestling tweets out breaking news that CM Punk was spotted at his house washing dishes....lol
[7:59:54] kodtheog: LUL
[7:59:56] Gorestack: yea it's a decent single player game if you're into Elder Scrolls but that's it
[7:59:56] Menisong: Any hope that league of legends mmo will be good?
[8:00:05] Melonbrew: I thought alot of ESO playerbase does PvP. Large scale Faction wars.
[8:00:07] kodtheog: i think league of legends mmo will be god tier
[8:00:14] kodtheog: too bad we gotta wait years to find out
[8:00:41] TheCliffyShow: Puts the focus on a lot of the stuff the single player games are known for. They just need to start allowing nude and sex mods and it'll be just like Skyrim but with other people.
[8:00:47] Cosmolus: PLS LET IT BE GOOD
[8:00:56] Dinokaze: I always hope a new mmo will be good, but considering league is own by Tencent, the changes it will be good are slim and the chances it will be a gatcha game are high.
[8:01:06] falsenx: i have hopes for that game
[8:01:07] kodtheog: im sure he will make it like wow but i would be willing to bet they will use their league of legends lore in it that will bring the already fans they have now into it
[8:01:13] bec0o: believe me some of the best dungs and raids mechanic in ESO, but you re right its just few ppl that do them high end. ZOS just cares about their casual players who makes 80% of the game.
[8:01:18] Menisong: would be a nice change to have another mmo for raids and group play
[8:01:28] kodtheog: if i can quest with my boy ezreal you already know ima be playing that shit
[8:01:48] jaysteea: i would pay tho
[8:01:51] falsenx: thats ok though

[8:02:07] kodtheog: thats good because it might make wow not go free to play but lower their prices @Towelliee what do you think
[8:02:09] TweakT: richkidMald
[8:02:18] TweakT: I watched a gud prison movie from 2001 last nite
[8:02:27] Eraste: i doubt it - but hey, I hope it's good, would love to check out another mmo
[8:02:33] swordwindgaming: @Towelliee It might be like Gran Saga? Brand new Korean MMO that is free to play but runs on gacha.
[8:02:36] jeneraljelly: people spend insane money on league of legends skins
[8:02:40] kodtheog: ^
[8:02:42] karmarmalade: i don't riot mmo will be focused on pvp, they have lol and tft for that. I expect a lot of lore and raids.
