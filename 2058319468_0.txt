[1:13:07] Arubicon: @Ey_an why....
[1:13:08] pisceslonewolf: I think they could give a little gold for PvP as PvP:ers don't always engage with the rest of the game. But I bet they can sees PvP:ers spend a lot of tokens so that's why they don't-

[2:44:10] Kymagez: how can you earn 1 billion a year and pay people $5 an hr :O
[2:44:11] Tactix2: sad thing is the fact they havent lowered the price is people are still paying it
[2:44:23] Kymagez: dude
[2:44:28] Gardor: they argued they dont want the boost to be efficient, just convenient for people who want a "right now" jumpstart to play with friends and dont care
[2:44:35] Kymagez: 1 bag yester cost me 70
[2:44:36] ihavesmokedcrack: 18$ big macs shits getting real!

[2:46:37] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i see green
[2:46:39] Kymagez: nothing
[2:46:42] WagwanBombaClatBomba: hes chilling
[2:46:51] nightmxz: What does having low-avg T mean?
[2:46:55] BCboy_: means hes kinda soy but not full soy
[2:46:56] Kymagez: better than nmp
[2:46:58] Craives: that's a huge range
[2:46:59] healhut: T is pretty variable
[2:47:00] Zorek64: means he's a female
[2:47:05] llseattlell: how is it possible for crusader to be a 42x r1 hpal**
[2:47:11] Zorek64: alts
[2:47:17] wyldeshock: drinking and stress lowered mine a lot temporarily
[2:47:23] Locturnal_TV: if hes low normal for his lifestyle thats actually pretty good
[2:47:23] Kymagez: who your sleeping with
[2:47:30] mini_ninja92: and men have a time of the month like women, just our T spikes
[2:47:34] Taevenx: I have my highest after going 6-0 in SS

[2:47:37] WagwanBombaClatBomba: ye one day it drops and u feel awful, and the next day its a rocket in the morning trenXD
[2:47:42] trollmasta66: The levels for diagoses for diagnosis is 123-814. That means nothing in terms of low or high, they check for symptoms. For a healthy male you want to be at 400-600
[2:47:44] WagwanBombaClatBomba: LUL
[2:47:45] Somanie: kinda ass men get boosts of testosterone in the mornings for extra energy and I just have to raw dog my day
[2:48:00] Somanie: PepeHands
[2:48:03] Taevenx: wait, I'm a Ret... 0-6 Kappa
[2:48:12] llseattlell: oh lord i thought you could only get r1 once per account per season
[2:48:33] Taevenx: I was watching Existence after you mentioned them in Van's stream, they were doing pretty good
[2:48:38] conman_91: what’s your time in q so far?
[2:48:43] rembrandt89: lightsbane

[2:49:45] Somanie: essplain mr. ruki
[2:49:47] Mcaveryst: hes got a neg w/l in ss lol
[2:49:47] NethixRS: doesnt matter anyway, ven is a 540 time rank 1
[2:49:48] llseattlell: how can you get r1 with a negative w/l ratio i dont get it.
[2:49:52] Fixit_cat: His cultists have invaded your chat
[2:49:53] healhut: man this guy lol
[2:49:57] feerce24: i think r1 only counts for the season, idc if you have 14 toons that get r1 its still only 1 imo
[2:50:00] allentrinh: The gate keeping, lol.
[2:50:05] wyldeshock: SL ret war players devastated by that take
[2:50:08] trollmasta66: dont a lot of rank ones have 2-4 of the same spec on the ladder to increase their chances of rank one.
[2:50:12] Felbladez: How many do you have venruki?
[2:50:17] Locturnal_TV: r1 is tied to the achievement. He has 11 achievements
[2:50:20] onetrickp: @llseattlell you should see the taiwan ladder, LUL
[2:50:27] nightmxz: @llseattlell only loses to healers higher than him so he goes up
[2:50:31] WagwanBombaClatBomba: but if u get r1 on diff classes Thats when u count
[2:50:38] llseattlell: did he buy like a r1 boost or somthing
[2:50:39] WagwanBombaClatBomba: it counts *
[2:50:41] Taevenx: so my 11 glad's from SL S2 don't count?!?
[2:50:41] rembrandt89: kalvish is 17 an has been r1 on 9 different classes
[2:50:48] llseattlell: cause if hes that fresh how did he immediately goto r1. lol
[2:50:58] zachgamegodx: @rembrandt89 hes 18
[2:51:04] xilyx2: kalvish has r1 on 9 classes?
[2:51:07] wyldeshock: @Taevenx hey ez that was my first glad
[2:51:22] llseattlell: isnt there a guy thats multi r1 on literally every class?
[2:51:29] xilyx2: Nick is yes

[2:51:40] Fixit_cat: Isn't there a guy with like 20 Enh shaman alts
[2:51:41] xilyx2: most underrated player around
[2:51:47] BCboy_: scammed kicked and blocked from boosters cartel
[2:51:52] nightmxz: Doesn't max have r1 on most as well?
[2:52:01] xilyx2: thats what underrated means..
[2:52:06] xilyx2: you know cause you know!
[2:52:07] xxbearrcattxx: I've been trolled by a few boosters lol
[2:52:21] WagwanBombaClatBomba: question is , who has the most r1 titels
[2:52:37] nightmxz: Everyone thinks nick is really good lol
[2:52:42] Zorek64: Bigdam has 31 shaman and 20 geared
[2:52:44] WagwanBombaClatBomba: swapxy has a lot
[2:52:45] healhut: under rated is like people thinking a player isn't as good as they actually are
[2:52:48] mstr_shake: underrated and unknown are diff
[2:52:56] mavdluffy: wheres brain/prev/drake at these days?
[2:52:58] Craives: if you can count multiple r1s per season you devalue the pre % r1s way too much
[2:53:00] healhut: dont think that applies to nick
[2:53:05] xilyx2: everyone who knows about him sure.. most people dont is what im saying.. more people know crusader i bet
[2:53:09] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @zorek64 that guy is a GIGACHAD jazggzOMEGAKEK
[2:53:24] llseattlell: so who has the most legit r1's then
[2:53:24] Zorek64: and probably all enhancement
[2:53:27] mstr_shake: @xilyx2 so he's less known, not undervalued
[2:53:31] llseattlell: like singular r1's on a class.
[2:53:46] Fixit_cat: Love the gambas
[2:53:50] healhut: Yes
[2:53:52] wowjumper: why did the euro healer get banned?

[2:59:45] Fixit_cat: Chaniyam pretty solid
[2:59:46] NethixRS: liquid won most of the early games, the move worked out how to beat them. the move had to dampen them
[2:59:47] Forestw97: They were intoxicated i believe
[2:59:49] BCboy_: sam been practicing lock all week
