[0:19:51] XialdinSR: litterally they have ruined the spec, they have forced us to use Starfire to make up for the damage loss on starsurge which in PVP is just a recipe for spell knockback, interuptions and death
[0:19:54] unique_protege: I hit 1.2k with arcane surge lul
[0:19:55] idkfaaaaaaaa: 35% whew

[0:35:17] Selentus: arcane mage for 2k is fine ? ^^
[0:35:17] Perdonamo: fair for pvp but ruined pve for balance
[0:35:18] leroyblinkintv: any other classes insta cast spells dont hit that hard
[0:35:18] bamfosaurus: Just dont touch mutilate blizz Prayge
[0:35:22] TodBobertson: STARFIRE IS TRASH WHO CARES IF THEY BUFF IT IT IS NOT WORTH PUSHING ROFL!
[0:35:23] BerCraft_: Toxicopathy subscribed with Prime. 
[0:35:25] karlakh_: for PvP for sure, what we should do in PvE??
[0:35:27] moxie826: Buff to your next Starfire that you'll never be able to cast in pvp

[0:35:39] Gekke_Henkie_: druids are bad now
[0:35:40] myodoctor: it should disarm

[0:35:44] Gekke_Henkie_: its not good
[0:35:45] henk121: @xaryu what is the mage rotation for mage healing?

[0:35:59] xiClutchBoyix: Druids got nerfed one time so far, don't make the comparison to hunters. Hunters got nerfed every single week for 2 months
[0:36:00] Mokanshu: as ele my frost shock is critting for 600 with a 20y range and 200 mana cost so i think starsurge is fine

[0:36:14] UlyssesChurch: what are all the druids rerolling to now then?
[0:36:14] kipheh: they should add a scorch effect to wrath that increases star surge damage, that way it’ll feel good in PVE
[0:36:14] KJBirl: live is anyways
[0:36:16] TheDeavs: As Affli lock none of my "instead" hit that high
[0:36:16] PeeDub1969: and hunters were STILL leading damage
[0:36:17] Z_Luke: Spriest and hunter pets need a nerf.
[0:36:22] TheDeavs: So they better be happy still

[1:23:25] partakone66: i like how he says the original hamster servers
[1:23:26] ca_Y_z: its cold outside
[1:23:33] 0kfatty: @Xaryu Lets just be real, i'm a player who know whats needed for doing high m+ and endgame mythic, but normal enough to see what Addons in retail needs to stop, the hole game is based around third party programs to track shit you have to interupt or move from. its sooo stupid.
[1:23:35] hot_souffle: LMFAOOOOOOO
[1:23:45] siggysudzz: @siggysudzz he does, they played osrs until hardcore release and she started playing it and he hasnt started yet, until now i suppose

[1:24:20] pho_rilla: fair assessment
[1:24:34] Greencaps07: wait he switched tab to an ability how does he switch targets
[1:24:38] BingoTingler: Hmm
[1:24:38] PuffnTuff: Classic is more complicated endgame honestly, so many dumb items in the game to learn how to master instead of just min maxing your class.
[1:24:39] zeqxylol: retail way too ez
[1:24:40] partakone66: @0kfatty what high lvl m+?
[1:24:41] BingoTingler: monkaHmm
[1:24:43] ChillyHTX: sodaHmm
[1:24:45] BingoTingler: classic has to be easier
[1:24:51] kindaopmusic: yep
[1:24:52] craghack20: retail is way easier
[1:24:55] EmilDaGamer: simple is better.
[1:24:57] DBGmal: I always say start Classic
[1:24:57] blaaaaakee: like rs3 vs osrs
[1:24:58] bergy101: current retail 100% not easier. button bloat is insane
[1:24:59] Mandoogles: classic is probably more new player friendly. theres too much in retail now
[1:24:59] ogzauce: its extremely confusing
[1:25:00] TacoN64: so much going on in retail
[1:25:00] Blehbeh03: classic is better
[1:25:01] barkerdoa: retail is easier bit feel souless when leveling
[1:25:01] Rhetaz: He knows more than he is saying his GF is a wow streamer
[1:25:04] hot_souffle: Retail way too ez. You can absolute go max level by doing quests only
[1:25:12] beluga_boy07: I know this is super parasocial, but I wanna say it seems like ur a good guy at heart. Im glad u finding success :) @Xaryu
[1:25:12] Fuzziew: Gameplay?? Classic. Mind numbing 2 button per rotation
[1:25:19] barkerdoa: theres just no one around leveling and it doesn't feel the same
[1:25:20] ChillyHTX: oh this is jimmy from fluttens stream
[1:25:34] tenthface: FeelsWeirdMan
[1:25:36] trickyshot_: They need to expand on this
[1:25:37] N3x3z: KEKW
[1:25:43] 0kfatty: @partakone66 it dont matter, that you have a game that makes you install third party programs, update and from time to time f up your wow with error messages is sooo stupid. if you cant see it. you got your head up your own ass.
[1:25:44] Nylox: New but has details?

[1:31:26] impa1nful: game play please
[1:31:32] BingoTingler: ye
[1:31:34] Doimos89: I think they should have something like 2 leveling paths, bc when you start a new alt as a seasoned player you don't want to level for 2 months
[1:31:38] BingoTingler: all about the journey
[1:31:40] PuffnTuff: smacking boars to 60 then GDKPs, hell yea
[1:31:41] MVRD: I wish New World has progression similar to WoW
[1:31:45] jacobboyles1: its just a completely different game at max level
[1:31:51] ChillyHTX: I think classic has great prog
[1:31:56] veekslol: max lvl classic is so boring, lvling with my friend and killing everyone we ran into was the fun part
[1:32:07] latinaholic: Facts
[1:32:10] goatyoga420: CLASSIC = Game ends at max level   RETAIL = Game starts at max level
[1:32:12] Spikeqc: Hmm
[1:32:13] SnakeCodes: True facts
[1:32:19] anelko90: hey @Xaryu is it worth doing event love is in the air ?
[1:32:31] Caidrox: @PuffnTuff ppl who do gdkp dont deserve fun tbh
[1:32:35] Fnoopen: ofc, but classic was the same that way when it "was" retail
[1:32:36] 2oublewidesuprise: LUL

[1:33:26] fetza108: Yoga Pog
[1:33:33] PuffnTuff: thats literally the best part about classic and why people like it, its a loot box simulator every kill
[1:33:37] Doimos89: @squarepusher_ KEKW god damn dude that made me laugh
[1:33:51] treyywow: ez upgrade
[1:33:55] Naker996: world of addons KEKW
[1:34:03] l3sch: haah
[1:34:03] SirGrindsAl0t: QUIN DPS Pog
[1:34:05] Banzeye95: it’s because in 2004 the main money maker was the sub fee, so you make levelling take months - now it’s in micro transactions, people won’t spend money unless they’re max level @xaryu
[1:34:06] NawtyTyme: hahhaah
[1:34:07] Garzag_: xdd
[1:34:08] NawtyTyme: truuuue

[1:34:38] espi: o7 healer
[1:34:41] DrunkenTabard: you didn't get better, just wearing more shiny crap
[1:34:50] bergy101: 45-60 should probably be paced better tbh
[1:35:02] butlerlog: in retail as you level your damage in dungeons gets worse, bc lower level characters get absurd scaling. so you actually regress instead of progress
[1:35:06] PMA_1: in HC
[1:35:07] prismo5: 1 week content max lvl then raidlog Sadge
[1:35:12] mangokg: i did
[1:35:14] IceAges: Not necessary quit, but re-roll new char
[1:35:18] palac105: I quit max level SOD phase 1
[1:35:21] LordMaxime__: And in SOD we got the satisfaction to get OS button in PVP
[1:35:24] YoMrMoss: i got into wow making 19 twinks
[1:35:30] YoMrMoss: shit was so much fun
[1:35:35] SirGrindsAl0t: what about max reputation DansGame
[1:35:35] thesirganks: I read that 90% of all wow players have never been in a normal raid or higher
[1:35:37] PuffnTuff: dont forgot the consumes
[1:36:03] Jvcifer: Whats that website
[1:36:17] treyywow: GAMMA
[1:36:36] Sunashi_: based
[1:36:38] fulgrimXO: and if ytou dont do it you're a noob
[1:36:48] BIuffwatcher: I feel same levelling too
[1:36:48] malnourish_: when players know they can optimize its hard to ignore
[1:36:52] CatDad__: thank goodness I raided before websites and spreadsheets
[1:36:57] ChillyHTX: yeah fair, gearing is crazy easy now tho with badges
[1:37:01] Genghish: And thats why we have PvP
[1:37:07] ColbaeTV: YEP YEP
[1:37:09] Genghish: Pvp is the true endgame
[1:37:22] SirGrindsAl0t: PVPers GIGACHAD
[1:37:31] l3sch: DONT FORGOT PVP
[1:37:34] Adem9x: guy is a walking contradiction
[1:38:00] SirGrindsAl0t: but i dont wanna do it Sadge
[1:38:21] ashraf_ma: It is optional tho ?
[1:38:24] buhtterstick: wtf 2G
[1:38:28] askinforit: @ashraf_ma no
[1:38:42] Doenerscharff: the gold rewards on retail are so shitty for like a decade now hahahaaha
[1:38:45] Doimos89: 100 gold? POGSLIDE
[1:38:46] basicks21: then you go on the AH and everything is 5k plus
[1:38:51] ashraf_ma: @askinforit yeah ... you can do any previous expansion , u get a quest to go talk to chromie as soon as u drop in SW
[1:39:00] PuffnTuff: 100g in retail is like 1 copper lol
[1:39:12] d0mezg4mer: yeah in retail difficulty starts at end game
[1:39:16] Seibi92: @ashraf_ma not on a new account tho
[1:39:20] murcielagor: Leveling just tutorial
[1:39:23] d00dledan: @ashraf_ma if youre a brand new account its not optional
[1:39:41] goatyoga420: this is an amazing video
[1:39:41] ashraf_ma: I see thank you , didn't know that
[1:39:45] Garzag_: but i would argue blizzard does that because they are trying to cater to what most players want
[1:39:48] Jim_Boozie: i believe soon they are looking at making Dragonflight the new default leveling experience for new players which would be good imo
[1:39:58] BIuffwatcher: they address that with DF?  you just start as explorer
[1:40:04] BIuffwatcher: for new players maybe
[1:40:04] PuffnTuff: whats different when doing classic quests? lol all a sham
[1:40:14] PuffnTuff: for xp
[1:40:18] N3x3z: retail bad
[1:40:22] pretty_cool_guy: monkaS
[1:40:26] Genghish: Retail is singleplayer
[1:40:28] hot_souffle: true
[1:40:29] SirGrindsAl0t: other humans DansGame
[1:40:29] OinkNico: W take
[1:40:31] treyywow: he was almost done tho
[1:40:33] mangokg: faqs
[1:40:33] d0mezg4mer: ah man he never made it to the best part of retail
[1:40:34] PMA_1: xarPain
[1:40:35] crownhs: Bombdrop
[1:40:35] ahux_: thats a good thing, people are twats
[1:40:35] Herzenliegen: yep 100 true
[1:40:38] hot_souffle: retail is so bad
[1:40:38] ColbaeTV: Aware
[1:40:41] ArkanisRP: just doesnt feel like wow
[1:40:41] latinaholic: Talking to others WutFace
[1:40:43] limburgse: jup
[1:40:46] Burritosalad: retail is an mm0 at max lvl
[1:40:46] HunterericTV: and if its the other way around 1-70 classic timings would suck also, whatever fits the narrative i guess
[1:40:46] Hellacat: lots of instanced campaign quests
[1:40:47] Burritosalad: only
[1:40:48] ansgot: RPG with side dish of MMO
[1:40:52] jackpack9tv: damn xaryu spittin rn
[1:40:53] statow: Thats why i love classic
[1:40:54] jackpack9tv: facts!
[1:40:57] Doimos89: I don't wanna talk to anyone though
[1:40:57] Elysianlight: I mean, the msq in ffxiv is very popular, and it's like a hundreds of hours long single player mmo
[1:40:57] ReinvigorateTV: Retail is Solo Q until High End Content and even than there PUGs
[1:40:58] Cowslapping: you do that more at max level on retail, not leveling
[1:40:58] PuffnTuff: well youre looking in the wrong places
[1:40:59] Burritosalad: classic is pog
[1:40:59] buhtterstick: I met my first gf on WoW
[1:41:00] taylorsdank: yea its actually awful  and 90% of the world has no players unless mounts are there
[1:41:00] goatyoga420: HUH
[1:41:00] Fujinator: classic its more people hating and being toxic than nice, I prefer retail.
[1:41:00] imDigitalDave: imDigitalDave subscribed with Prime. 
[1:41:03] buhtterstick: He was a great guy
[1:41:04] reallyeric: thats what wow classic os for tho, theres retail and theres classic...
[1:41:04] limburgse: i really love the classic vibes ❤️
[1:41:04] espi: BOOBA roleplaying
[1:41:04] Shut_Up_Jack: do people still do large raids in retail ? are guilds still a vital thing?
[1:41:05] teis05: E R P BABY
[1:41:07] butlerlog: retail is an esport
[1:41:09] prismo5: the first interaction would be in a toxic m+12 group lmao
[1:41:11] dryangore: i hear you gotta go to moonguard for rpg in retail
[1:41:12] lasmino: on sod the other day i had a guy randomly give me a gold on a road and i still think about him  at night
[1:41:14] SirGrindsAl0t: selfish mmo Pog
[1:41:16] ipntheshower: You know an MMO is popping off when they are talking about polictics in general chat @Xaryu
[1:41:17] wackiz: I can level in classic without human interaction aswell, its all about how you go about it
[1:41:17] soulnobi: What type of roleplaying?
[1:41:18] ahux_: repeatable content, where classic isn't
[1:41:19] klugzy: human interaction doesnt come in until higher keys or harder raid content... which if you are in DF, brand new, doesn't come quick
[1:41:20] reallyeric: everyone knows this though why are we saying this
[1:41:22] Aishea26: some times is not even about talking with others, is just seeing them runing around the world
[1:41:23] nikodeemuz: they also for feed u that fucking bfa dungeon if u try that route....
[1:41:23] Noralynn: Hi! I joined the stream late and I'm interested in watching this full video - is anyone able to send me a link or let me know who this is in the video?
[1:41:24] PuffnTuff: majority of PVP is not top end lol
[1:41:24] jackpack9tv: pikabooo! lOL
[1:41:27] jackpack9tv: LOL!
[1:41:27] Tatsubaki: modCheck pika
[1:41:28] BIuffwatcher: can roll on RP realms for community aswell.
[1:41:30] Shadowfell_: @Xaryu What do you mean ? on max level you cant do shit solo if you want to have good rewards... problem is, you are most of the time not making friends, ppl just "helping" each other without caring about one another
[1:41:30] l3sch: like pika
[1:41:32] nyosbk: I played with my buddy who came from GW2 and he prefered classic over retails leveling cause retails is a mess
[1:41:32] Doimos89: I want both
[1:41:35] reallyeric: you talked about this so many times
[1:41:35] SirGrindsAl0t: anti social mmo Pog
[1:41:37] Ezrathexton: you may as well start at max level.  but i still think once youre max lvl the community is better in retail @xaryu
[1:41:37] hot_souffle: pikabooIRL lol
[1:41:38] herd_of_llamas: @Noralynn j1mmy on youtube
[1:41:44] Noralynn: Thanks so much!
[1:41:49] grouchdouglass: Is wrath not dead still?
[1:41:50] beccabeethebug: do people play wrath? :O
[1:41:55] jackpack9tv: pikaboo
[1:41:56] SlypTachi: wrath is still fun :]
[1:41:57] ahlk: there’s more casual & social content in retail
[1:41:57] goatyoga420: wrath is dead
[1:41:58] AMLoogi: u can still join guilds which plays into the mmo portion
[1:41:59] voncline88: Retail should just not have levels anymore tbh, just gear treadmills
[1:42:00] nointhedjoba: @Fujinator Did you play it a lot? I have 10 times more nice experiences than toxic ones
[1:42:01] fetza108: i play very casually solo content retail i like that too
[1:42:08] Decoyduck: ive already had so many fun interactions with people in SOD its nuts
[1:42:08] Darshwick: i feel like it wsa like that until BFA with level reset to 60
[1:42:08] ChillyHTX: wrath isn’t dead ppl still queing arenas and raid logging
[1:42:09] ashraf_ma: @ahlk literally
[1:42:09] grouchdouglass: the comments on retail are dead on tho
[1:42:11] Mandoogles: i have people on my friends list still playing wrath
[1:42:11] Blkmrkt1: mac miller quote
[1:42:12] Sylph241: wrong depends on the server in classic. Classic 2019 was great. SoD with those gigaservers doesnt feel like that anymore
[1:42:12] statow: haha
[1:42:14] Darshwick: 0-120 was great
[1:42:16] soujehz: haha
[1:42:17] Fujinator: @nointhedjoba Nearing my second 40, might have played too much, true
[1:42:18] PuffnTuff: hes surprised people are not in a old expansion?
[1:42:21] emosoda: haha
[1:42:31] Nazeal2: I was watching Cdew in the Arena Championships Saturday and I was so lost
[1:42:32] Decoyduck: I hate this
[1:42:34] Hellacat: i dont like it
[1:42:35] barkerdoa: that mob scaling really ruined fun for me
[1:42:36] taylorsdank: Legacy content is some of the best stuff to do and lots of people still do it for collecting
[1:42:39] nyosbk: yeah leveling in retail is bad honestly
[1:42:42] fetza108: y
[1:42:42] Branura: hate this shit
[1:42:42] vak_hunt: you actually feel weaker as you go
[1:42:43] limburgse: not fun
[1:42:44] Slyxen: I always hated the "Skyrim" level system
[1:42:44] taylorsdank: but leveling is awful
[1:42:45] kaley03: scaling is the only reason why i'll never like retail
[1:42:45] BIuffwatcher: nowhere is scary.  you can't explore
[1:42:47] Kersed805: its really bad
[1:42:48] barkerdoa: that’s worse than not having social. mob scaling is so dumb
[1:42:50] jacobboyles1: feels more like keep up instead of pregressing
[1:42:50] Guydx: also why do you hit like 100 million vs low levels?
[1:42:50] ChillyHTX: no sense of danger seeing a red or skull mobs too
[1:42:51] Ingajke: tes oblivion exp
[1:42:52] beccabeethebug: leveling in retail is such a joke and it's so sad T^T
[1:42:54] buhtterstick: LUL
[1:42:54] LoosieJuice: @ChillyHTX think about what raid logging actually is... there is literaly nothing for you to do in the game except log in for raid... usualy 1 or 2 times per week. no longer "playing" you're just doing a weekly
[1:42:54] RushTurok: That was one of the changes they made with Age of Conan early on that helped kill the game off
[1:42:55] Nuggnuts: number go up
[1:42:56] vagner260100: Retail only has late game
[1:42:56] crownhs: Same with diablo 4
[1:42:56] thesirganks: ye, at this point you make a new char they should just be instant max level on retail
[1:43:00] jacksunson: I watched this video last night, and i don't mind im watching it again. Good YT'er
[1:43:05] treyywow: the progression doesn’t start until the end game
[1:43:09] Shadoreaperr: as a kid I loved trying to kill red lvls or skulls
[1:43:11] Tatsubaki: Not to mention you can level 10-70 in dungeons wthout entering a single zone
[1:43:22] Endtree: i remember beating elite solo as lvl 13, next time i could beat it was when i was 3 lvls overlvled in bfa
[1:43:22] nemeuxs: for character fantasy retail gives that with the end game, and by playing end game content you can socialize
[1:43:23] dryangore: but it's irrelevent in classic too... you get less or no exp from them and the materials aren't useful anymore for the most part
[1:43:25] ColbaeTV: YEP
[1:43:26] BIuffwatcher: @Shadoreaperr heading into Nagrand at level 60!
[1:43:27] okayfood: For pve that is true but not for pvp
[1:43:28] KShellZx: that's a huge issue in retail. you don't FEEL your upgrades
[1:43:28] friday_exe: nameplates are luxury>
[1:43:28] sheltereddougy: feeling class progression/identity while leveling in classic is also huge
[1:43:32] nyosbk: I don’t understand how the devs think this way of leveling was a good idea crazy
[1:43:35] stoneiscrazy: hey. could u pls send link of the vid ? <3
[1:43:42] ashraf_ma: Lmao , "played them a lot"
[1:43:43] nointhedjoba: @Fujinator I think it also depends on what you do in there. If you only concentrate on leveling and item grind you will miss a lot. I have a great guild and also people on the friends list who literally say "hit me up if you need anything"
[1:43:46] limburgse: in retail you can be max lvl in 7 hours, whats the fun of that?!
[1:43:48] Selentus: guys how good is shadowpriest in SoD ? trying to get started !
[1:43:48] KShellZx: getting a new weapon as a warrior in classic, you felt like a god
[1:43:58] ebabilyasin2: retail sucks !
[1:43:59] jungelregla: @Selentus literally bis in raids atm
[1:44:01] taylorsdank: @stoneiscrazy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXyDqyxRifY
[1:44:02] Sylph241: but its the same in SoD right now with those Gigaservers
[1:44:03] Genghish: @selentus good in pvp too
[1:44:05] Jumanjidm: @Selentus too good
[1:44:06] nyosbk: and the story is so soft lol
[1:44:07] PuffnTuff: SoD is all about end game
[1:44:08] Saturos47: make WoW 2
[1:44:10] nemic1991: i fail to see how him not having friends is the games fault
[1:44:11] Craigumander: Use chatgpt Kappa
[1:44:14] RushTurok: server wipe every 2 weeks, like rust
[1:44:15] Fujinator: Personaly I think retail is much more fun if you have a good group of friends where you can raid with and do other stuff with. if you don't have that, classic is probably beter
[1:44:16] nointhedjoba: @Selentus Seems to be very good!
[1:44:16] DeathToad007: wow story is so convoluted over xpacs
[1:44:21] Selentus: nice, thanks chat !
[1:44:22] Hobblets: the only time I talk with someone in sod is if were both waiting on a quest respawn
[1:44:24] abzurth: WoW 2 or Classic 2 with better Graphics
[1:44:25] Selentus: is he hard to lvl ?
[1:44:25] SirGrindsAl0t: level slow WutFace
[1:44:26] xNotorietyx: needs a reset
[1:44:27] casperthefrndlyforgeafker: gotta reset the game
[1:44:28] Shut_Up_Jack: Build a community and need for interaction , not a leveling Sim
[1:44:28] iStrudderz: Giving us months of gameplay? wow who would ever want that
[1:44:29] PMA_1: SoD is wow2 beta
[1:44:31] Blkmrkt1: lets change wow over 20 years and then go back to classic lol
[1:44:32] wippie__: You create systems that force people to be in the world
[1:44:33] BLUNDERGUN: a RESET
[1:44:35] taylorsdank: @nemic1991 he's not saying he doesnt KNOW anyone to play with, he's saying he didnt meet anyone in game which is a huge part of an MMO
[1:44:36] domigs: domigs subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! hey xar nice stream keep going and good luck in gnomergan. FOR GNOMERGAN
[1:44:37] wonkus1: all of these problems = just join a good guild and retail is a great mmo
[1:44:38] Seibi92: hard reset
[1:44:39] YoMrMoss: NEW GAME
[1:44:40] PuffnTuff: SoD and classic literally degen all the way to 60 for end game content
[1:44:41] ebabilyasin2: sod = wow 2 beta
[1:44:41] SkinniestGoblin: Complete reset WoW 2
[1:44:41] BergEsquire: Nuke the middle islands
[1:44:41] 2oublewidesuprise: WOW 2
[1:44:43] ColbaeTV: Aware there’s no solution
[1:44:43] palac105: @Xaryu It's simple, kill the Bat...World of Warcraft.
[1:44:43] crobeamer: Realms don't really matter anymore in retail
[1:44:45] thesunnyside: They need to make everywhere "end game" and have a strict area for levelling
[1:44:45] SkinniestGoblin: Theres no other way
[1:44:46] YoMrMoss: SPACE WOW
[1:44:47] beccabeethebug: just to a realm reborn imo :3
[1:44:48] Grebdlug: make the story destroy all we know
[1:44:48] nikodeemuz: it really isnt that hard.... wow 2
[1:44:49] ZenafTV: give max level people reasons to go to the old world
[1:44:52] vak_hunt: delete wow
[1:44:52] blazzedzz: You go to SOD lol
[1:44:58] Elysianlight: you'd also be levelling like 1-140. i remember 1-120 in bfa was awful
[1:44:58] Genghish: Wow 2: bring all of wow together in a new game that takes the good elements of Classic and the few good things of retail
[1:44:59] SirGrindsAl0t: i personally love leveling in wow tbh but thats just me
[1:45:05] Yeddamand: *Cough cough wow 2*
[1:45:06] invisalble: S/O TUTORIAL ISLAND
[1:45:07] paraflashtv: make retail pvp only instant 70 pve for classic +
[1:45:11] ebabilyasin2: SOD = WOW 2 BETA
[1:45:11] CatDad__: The problem is the assumption - that a game never ends.  That's a fallacy.  Games always must end.
[1:45:13] dugy6: @nikodeemuz never gonna happen unforunatly
[1:45:14] Fujinator: @nointhedjoba getting declined for cathedral runs because you aren't level 39 and a meta class is even worse than M+ in raiding atm
[1:45:16] DoctorDrops: i leveled my first character in legion before the leveling change and it took so long
[1:45:17] jordskii4tw: the end all be all is going to be retail+ where they reset all of retail to a new game
[1:45:34] Genghish: @ebabilyasin2 true and real and truthfull and reality
[1:45:36] barkerdoa: even if you don’t talk to players, it’s fun to see others leveling doing their thing as you do the same. it’s just about not being alone. that’s the point of playing online
[1:45:42] vagner260100: Its perfect u have the two options u got choose what u prefer...
[1:45:44] DeathToad007: convoluted mess of storylines
[1:45:46] atomicblonde_pr: i play this game from the biggining and stop because of this i dint even tuch dragofly sucks
[1:45:46] killtor: Only thing that is good in retail is Mythic Plus and maybe just maybe some raid encounters.
[1:45:47] Mysaw: j1mmy Pog By release Pog
[1:45:52] tonyvitek: my solution would be that the latest expansion is the only leveling zone with slow progression. and have the story recapped in video format for players
[1:45:56] GodofToaster: what is that video? anyone as link
[1:46:03] PMA_1: mitchD
[1:46:04] vak_hunt: :O
[1:46:05] ArkanisRP: same
[1:46:05] carpe_astra: It's not simple but I always thought they should stop expanding and have a changing world I stead.
[1:46:06] SirGrindsAl0t: D:

[1:46:34] GodofToaster: what is that video
[1:46:34] lovekach: POOPA
[1:46:39] opaf69: got me edging
[1:46:40] Kazunya_Meowryu: @tonyvitek thats so boring and limits what an mmo is a world to explore, being trapped in one place sounds awful
[1:46:40] HogwartsLegacyOfficial: did you jump on at 12
[1:46:43] tibbey_1: Yo xaryu what's up
[1:46:44] Tatsubaki: Listening

[1:47:10] imDigitalDave: kehbold
[1:47:14] HogwartsLegacyOfficial: love deadmines
[1:47:19] nointhedjoba: @Genghish I don't know whether Blizzard can do it to be honest. The direction retail went shows how they prefer game design right now
[1:47:20] tuhaf710: vanqueef
[1:47:23] HogwartsLegacyOfficial: GoldPLZ GoldPLZ
[1:47:26] tats714: only game better than classic wow is the true greatest MMO of all time, OLD SCHOOL RUNESCAPE GIGACHAD

[1:47:50] Nuggnuts: KEKW
[1:47:51] Shonnicus: err he's lying. He turned off Quest Scroll then
[1:47:52] kindaopmusic: same
[1:47:54] Shut_Up_Jack: Voice over mod changed that for me
[1:47:56] vak_hunt: wow has always been shit at story telling
[1:47:56] SkinniestGoblin: I love reading the quests
[1:47:57] chasingshadowsz: WHY NOT 40 THO??
[1:47:58] fulgrimXO: the voice over addon made the game for me
[1:47:58] casperthefrndlyforgeafker: this guy is on point lol
[1:48:00] Tatsubaki: who reads quests modCheck
[1:48:00] ryedog_97: 1% are reading quests
[1:48:02] seancyx: If they had voice acting maybe?
[1:48:04] Eggzactly54: i have always been a skipper
[1:48:05] SirGrindsAl0t: quickquest is such a BIS addon Kreygasm
[1:48:05] Acework: its true in FF14 you actually enjoy the story feel laugh cry and experiance everything
[1:48:06] Hobblets: quest like voiceover really help
[1:48:07] Doimos89: same because wow has a good gameplay and you just wanna play
[1:48:10] Valvax: voice over makes it easier yea
[1:48:10] ChillyHTX: the voice over addon was nice for a little for hardcore
[1:48:11] Hobblets: addons like voiceover I mean
[1:48:11] Razerdoug: the voice addon did help a bit on HC
[1:48:11] killawatts75: Get really baked youll love the lore
[1:48:12] dopefiend_smurf: yeah the AI voice over addon was a game changer for me
[1:48:12] isaiahfadee: HeyGuys
[1:48:12] BerCraft_: Hardcore changed that thing
[1:48:14] williwhite94: sp addons ruined it for u lmao
[1:48:14] imDigitalDave: I was more into the lore years ago, the most recent expacs I haven't felt the need to be as into the story
[1:48:15] Magnificus_445: I read some during the release of an expansion, but get bored easily
[1:48:15] Shonnicus: He had to maunally turn of Quesst Text
[1:48:16] Mico027: Yeah voice over addon actualy make you care a bit more
[1:48:17] ColbaeTV: YEP
[1:48:17] nickylas: the gnomer lore was really cool to learn about before going into gnomer
[1:48:18] YoMrMoss: there some wild storylines
[1:48:20] limburgse: voiceover ROCKS
[1:48:21] irasin: this is why the AI voiceover mod is so amazing @Xaryu
[1:48:22] voncline88: voiceover is the best thing to happen to quest lore
[1:48:24] killtor: Quest Voiceover is a great addon to listen to quest while you travel
[1:48:24] vak_hunt: the story might be good, but the story telling was always shit
[1:48:29] Genghish: @nointhedjoba I cHope that the succes of classic makes them rethink their game Philosophy... Bloat ruined the game
[1:48:32] crownhs: Voice over addon fixes it, kind of
[1:48:32] ansgot: Most quests are forgettable but there are exceptions which are nice
[1:48:32] TrumpWallWorker: quest scroll is on by default KEKW
[1:48:34] invisalble: storytelling was much better in middle expansions
[1:48:38] NawtyTyme: ya the voice over has helped
[1:48:39] TransMutedMaya: @Xaryu tell it to me straight, is boomkin dead after the huge starsurge nerfs?
[1:48:40] Greencaps07: wow story is 2nd to the primary goal of end game
[1:48:40] nezt1: to be fair, wow vanilla isnt designed to use questie, you actually had to read the quest in the past to be able to complete them
[1:48:43] Kersed805: voiceover is nice for hc
[1:48:54] Xpere_RL: !followage
[1:48:55] StreamElements: @Xpere_RL, xpere_rl has been following xaryu for  4 years 5 months 22 days 17 hours
[1:49:03] tats714: the WoW novels are actually pretty good, the universe is amazing but the storytelling in the game just isnt robust enough
[1:49:06] MrStLouis68: I got the voiceover addon and then just auto dismiss it immediately :)
[1:49:07] SirGrindsAl0t: reading DansGame
[1:49:09] BLUNDERGUN: @nezt1 literally. questio has spoiled EVERYONE
[1:49:14] Genghish: Thrall tho
[1:49:16] roxaz_chachvm: @Xaryu u 40 yet?
[1:49:34] grouchdouglass: can someone link me this video
[1:49:35] Thunderfunky: each zone has it's own stories going on, and a part of the over all world lore. The little quests are mundane, but it's there if you care to enjoy it.
[1:49:38] Shut_Up_Jack: @Genghish LUL LUL
[1:49:39] nointhedjoba: @nointhedjoba To enjoy classic you need to be social.. You won't be denied any dungeons and raids if you are friends with a lot of people. I hardly do any pugs at all
[1:49:41] SirGrindsAl0t: KEKW
[1:49:45] Magnificus_445: TRU
[1:49:47] ColbaeTV: KEKW
[1:49:52] Garzag_: guys i know we're playing mythic + but im watching the cutscene PauseChamp

[1:50:42] tats714: wrath best storytelling the game has ever had
[1:50:47] Selentus: is there a ability difference in race when i play priest ?
[1:50:51] acked123: Im gay and nobody cares
[1:51:00] kingt0s: @celorion2 no wow player cares about other games/new games
[1:51:03] Swaggerhound0: wrath is bis expac
[1:51:05] fatalix17: ScaredyCat
[1:51:05] Genghish: L gamer
[1:51:06] Duckacubed: Wrath was such a fucking vibe
[1:51:07] killawatts75: So he has good taste
[1:51:08] orrifez: i mean wrath is the best expac
[1:51:09] tats714: @Xaryu hes big on questing, and wrath has the best questing
[1:51:11] Duckacubed: The last time I cared about the story
[1:51:11] AMLoogi: he cares about story a lot
[1:51:12] JihnFei: wrath was lit beecause of the follow up lore with warcraft 3
[1:51:14] regulater45: Acked me too
[1:51:16] friday_exe: wotlk is bis
[1:51:16] d0mezg4mer: wrath is the best middle ground for a new player
[1:51:18] reallyeric: isnt wrath techinically the best wow expansion ever made by blizzard?
[1:51:21] Deomas11: WotLK is a great game, the community makes it unplayable.
[1:51:22] Billpaul3: I think it's because WotLK wraps up the story that started when we were all kids
[1:51:23] Naker996: wrath = best exp
[1:51:24] imDigitalDave: Wrath made 14 year old me so happy i picked Paladin as my class Kappa
[1:51:25] Faram1r: Wrath is goated
[1:51:25] macjcool: wc3 stream when
[1:51:27] c0gnusTV: wrath is complete garbage
[1:51:29] Greencaps07: Jimmy's whole thing is lore i seem form his osrs content
[1:51:33] celorion2: even super mario bros is more fun to play then wow
[1:51:33] smashkan: Lets be real modern wow players dont play for story, this guy is playing it the way it should be
[1:51:34] ashraf_ma: not making it to max lvl in retail is basically not even playing it , kinda sucks
[1:51:34] Gyrsch: he should just read all the books :D
[1:51:37] Austyz: wrath had the best villain for sure Arthas was sick
[1:51:38] goatyoga420: @kingt0s  not true, i am like 12year+ wow veteran but i am on break right now playing OSRS/FPS like COD/valorant, i will go back to WOW when cata comes out
[1:51:39] discipleyo: no one cared about the story back then
[1:51:39] ShreddedIsland: pvp is in shambles
[1:51:40] fulgrimXO: i forget sometimes we started as a RTS
[1:51:47] tats714: books are good but Nerdge
[1:51:51] JihnFei: we all played for story when we were kids. now we are all orange/pink parse slaves
[1:51:53] Swaggerhound0: arthas book is god
[1:51:56] ChillyHTX: vulpes3Nerd we technically wc came out first so you should alrdy known the lore
[1:51:56] Swaggerhound0: good
[1:51:57] Sunashi_: i enjoyed a couple of the books
[1:52:00] NotASkiller: why read when someone else will do that for you and make a video
[1:52:02] MakeASplash: books are great, esp the Arthas one
[1:52:03] mangokg: they are sick
[1:52:05] Nixia: @Swaggerhound0 agree
[1:52:09] smashkan: @JihnFei 100%
[1:52:11] kingt0s: @TOMMYSLICER good for you, bud. I don't care tho xD

[1:52:36] SirGrindsAl0t: for a new player wow is huge
[1:52:38] Blkmrkt1: "we alrdy have 9 expansions... lets announce 3 more"
[1:52:41] Podpech1: We need WOW 2
[1:52:48] Greencaps07: they need to make a single player game of just the story for wow
[1:52:55] cthurston928: with 3 more coming

[1:53:20] butlerlog: the solution is SoD
[1:53:21] Acework: SOD IS THE ANSWER
[1:53:23] NotASkiller: retail is popping off more than ever
[1:53:26] grouchdouglass: They're too scared to start over and classic doesn't count for that
[1:53:26] casperthefrndlyforgeafker: SOD
[1:53:26] huckleson: sod is trash
[1:53:29] ItsBartell: with how many level and item crunches lol - its so complicated now to fix
[1:53:33] samuxtv: Solution is Reset the timeline with new characters
[1:53:33] thesirganks: it should leave you at 60 ready for the new xpac when you are done with tutorial island imo
[1:53:36] Shieldexx: WoW2 makes more sense looking at it this way
[1:53:39] ConfettiBC: the only real way is to compress the story as a single leveling experience cutting the busy work quest but thats too much dev time
[1:53:39] limburgse: SoD is the answer, im having so much fun!!
[1:53:45] Hobblets: its just not a new player friendly game, not sure what they could do to resolve it
[1:53:46] YoMrMoss: some story is also way better
[1:53:47] ahlk: he said he quit at 60 on retail which is unfortunate since the dragon isles have beautiful zones & a lot of great self-contained quest arcs
[1:53:50] qaspard: they need to craft one storyline that will take you thru all the expansions in a cohesive journey
[1:53:51] huckleson: sod is only for casuals lmfao
[1:53:51] YoMrMoss: they force you into some of the weakest
[1:53:55] zacharyboltz: yeah, it's a weird disconnect with new expacs knowing the original flow
[1:53:56] MakeASplash: Dragonflight has seemed to do a good job on keeping the world more engaing
[1:53:58] huckleson: a serious wow player doesnt have fun with sod
[1:54:00] barkerdoa: Sod for me feels like playing in 2004 again
[1:54:01] imDigitalDave: People also optimized and min/maxxed the fun out of WoW. If you run a dungeon for the first time, you're probably gonna get group kicked because everyone's in a damn hurry
[1:54:08] tats714: YEP
[1:54:08] ColbaeTV: BabyRage
[1:54:10] jtk13: D:
[1:54:10] pho_rilla: KEKW
[1:54:12] darthplagous: what if... everyone started in vanilla and each expansion was something you had to opt into as you got to it? hit 60? choose between starting BC or staying in vanilla for a while
[1:54:19] Seibi92: the next three expansions will set the ground for a hard reset of wow
[1:54:23] PuffnTuff: it would be ashame if you had to teach yourself something
[1:54:28] Valvax: babies take their precious milk
[1:54:30] Shonnicus: Yes simply a 20 year game is going to be hard for new players to get into
[1:54:30] Austyz: @ahlk i didn’t like dragon isles quests either. feels lifeless compared to questing in classic
[1:54:39] hunchurio: sod is just kind of boring but i see the appeal
[1:54:42] dinkey1111: @puffntuff you are such a negative person
[1:54:49] grouchdouglass: man how good are the box arts tho
[1:54:52] fjsaoiajoshrsaohsarrhsara: isnt wow more players than ever so who cares?
[1:54:54] fetza108: what sword?
[1:54:57] SirGrindsAl0t: me neither Sadge
[1:55:00] TransMutedMaya: I really like this guy's communication style, it's very relaxing and enjoyable
[1:55:03] SirGrindsAl0t: chromie Pog
[1:55:10] Herzenliegen: Yep
[1:55:11] PuffnTuff: just honest
[1:55:15] mangokg: the worst voice in game
[1:55:23] vak_hunt: why are they not even in order
[1:55:27] dinkey1111: @puffntuff not honest more like whiney
[1:55:29] Wujimx: It's terrible
[1:55:30] RingersRealm: its terrible
[1:55:30] crownhs: I tried, was too fast, couldnt do a full expansion
[1:55:31] SirGrindsAl0t: timewalking is pretty cool
[1:55:33] NAT0_141: chrome is BS
[1:55:35] Valvax: i liked chromies
[1:55:36] TransMutedMaya: he's not doing the rage bait stuff that so many people do these days, just talkin about his opinions, love it
[1:55:37] Burritosalad: its good for lfg
[1:55:39] Tatsubaki: I just use it to change the dungeons im leveling up in haha ICANT
[1:55:39] Neffehh: Yea, more like whiney indeed
[1:55:42] aRizeee: why add option to start in chronological order
[1:55:42] PuffnTuff: @dinkey1111 LUL
[1:55:43] TrumpWallWorker: retail players always talk about chromie being the answer and its total garbage
[1:55:45] Duckacubed: You level way too fast to really experience any of the expansions again
[1:55:46] nikodeemuz: its so bad
[1:55:56] limburgse: its bad
[1:56:00] Xelum_76: I tried to get back into retail and wanted to do MoP...but it locked me out after reaching max level and I didn't get to finish
[1:56:01] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Xaryu you should make a new character on retail and see how its like first hand lol
[1:56:02] hutchyy917: i love this
[1:56:03] Wujimx: LUL
[1:56:04] Hobblets: lol
[1:56:05] fetza108: y
[1:56:09] kindaopmusic: LUL LUL
[1:56:10] Herzenliegen: lmfao

[1:56:14] mistamang: operator error
[1:56:17] jsnqt: ngl this guy a bitch
[1:56:24] platinumtoe5: 1 anduin is already 1 too many. 3 is a nightmare
[1:56:24] Doimos89: just go back to 2006 and play from vanilla, EZ
[1:56:28] Herzenliegen: no one at all
[1:56:28] arinn2505: @Xaryu dark and darker any time in the future? :O
[1:56:31] BIuffwatcher: 100%
[1:56:34] MakeASplash: yes dude
[1:56:35] Burritosalad: u shouldnt be in an empty world.
[1:56:38] SirGrindsAl0t: you do see some players
[1:56:43] buhtterstick: fax
[1:56:48] ColbaeTV: YEP
[1:56:48] Hobblets: I prefer a somewhat empty quest zone, the sod zones are a shit show right now
[1:56:49] gremell: yeeeeeeee
[1:56:50] tats714: playing wow these days is like a really shitty elden ring
[1:56:52] DBGmal: FAX
[1:56:53] Dourme: I was questing in Vashjir last night. I was the only one.
[1:56:53] JihnFei: we love giant open world until you realize you cant quest for shit so you hole your self in dungeons for 20 hours straight
[1:56:54] PuffnTuff: go to valdrakken, youll see people plenty
[1:56:54] hemofeeliac: one of my best friends irl was made through questing and dungeoning together in woltlk when it was live
[1:56:54] Cuhrismuh: Everybody’s afk in valdrakken on retail LUL
[1:56:55] friday_exe: even valdraken is empty LUL
[1:56:56] TodBobertson: @SirGrindsAl0t You mean bots?
[1:56:56] TrumpWallWorker: @platinumtoe5 real and true
[1:56:57] BIuffwatcher: why i play on RP realm... so city is alive!
[1:56:58] Geesen: Soo true
[1:57:00] Valvax: 101239 servers and shards
[1:57:02] SirGrindsAl0t: are they leveling?probably not mostly farming a mount but i have seen people in the old zones
[1:57:05] Doimos89: it does WTF?
[1:57:10] Nerzoth: yea...
[1:57:11] vak_hunt: 99% sitting in valdrakken
[1:57:11] AceOfFlame: @Cuhrismuh ya but on normal classic everyone kinda just logs out till raid time
[1:57:17] Overkrow: Blizzard has an issue removing dead content, which is fair
[1:57:18] Hobblets: try to compete for mob tags in sod and youll change your mind fast
[1:57:19] RobRoads: My SOD experience has been great! lots of grouping and helping. love it
[1:57:20] DBGmal: retail is just people chasing key timers
[1:57:25] ebabilyasin2: because retail map is very very very 9x very biggg
[1:57:27] ItsGigabud: Retail you basically NEED friends that play or its super lonely
[1:57:34] budmodeos: Great points. It is as thought level 1-60 need to go away. Dragonflight is very populated.
[1:57:34] SirGrindsAl0t: @TodBobertson no bots are easy af to identify and they werent bots
[1:57:35] okayfood: I disagree
[1:57:38] celorion2: i hate that there no people anymore in your timeline
[1:57:40] MakeASplash: nobody in the world, queue up for dungeon, group doesn't talk, go back to empty world... Questing in Retail is pretty awful
[1:57:41] handovdoom666: there are a lot of people in the current expansion. i think it's hard to argue that there would be a lot of people in every expansion. that isn't something that is going to happen.
[1:57:42] finalflight1: Facts
[1:57:44] internetrobot: Retail could have a call of duty que lobby and most end game players wouldn't mind @Xaryu
[1:57:50] soulnobi: !server
[1:57:50] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[1:57:54] statow: @ItsGigabud So true !
[1:58:00] DekRemzD: That's the reason I play on a large RP server on Retail. Rarely layer and its all of the same names.
[1:58:12] PuffnTuff: he shouldve played on Moonguard lol
[1:58:36] its_me_: he is
[1:58:37] AceOfFlame: AngelThump Varian
[1:58:42] DekRemzD: Really makes the world feel alive
[1:58:45] Leebleh: Jimmy Pog
[1:58:47] clamshell24: you have to do chromie with a friend who knows the expansion you are experiencing. I ran my cousin through a couple
[1:58:52] Valvax: take me back savixWow
[1:58:54] larw01: I don’t disagree with this guy but what’s the solution?
[1:58:54] MeatPuppet95: I think all mmo's need to address the map/gamesize power creep. Game gets bigger, we get farther from one another.
[1:58:55] biki2112: was that esfand
[1:58:57] Endtree: @internetrobot Well it has basically cod lobby with extra sandbox to collect tmog and mounts and sightsee.
[1:59:05] MakeASplash: it was pretty sweet doing classic and TBC again since everyone was online during Covid
[1:59:07] buhtterstick: this is a very well made video
[1:59:12] SirGrindsAl0t: champions GIGACHAD
[1:59:17] internetrobot: @Endtree yup.
[1:59:21] Herzenliegen: Waiting at gamestop to get your expansion at 12
[1:59:27] bigsugg: video wayy too long
[1:59:29] nvplord: This guy is dumb. What do you want from blizzard then? Want them to transport you back in time for you to play for the first time?
[1:59:31] nyosbk: he’s so right about all of it
[1:59:31] siggysudzz: his osrs garry gilbert series is hilarious even if u dont play the game
[1:59:32] ColbaeTV: YEP
[1:59:33] sharky_exp: rofl
[1:59:34] MeatPuppet95: truuuuuuuuuuu
[1:59:34] nodoh420: Go to valdrakken and you will see people everywhere. Quest in the dragon isles and you will see people everywhere. Most players have already done this content so they want to play the new content
[1:59:41] AmericanWarlord: whatever dude
[1:59:41] sharky_exp: not clocked in late
[1:59:47] Leebleh: nice to see this guy doing a non runescape vid @Xaryu
[1:59:49] BIuffwatcher: roll horde and do that
[1:59:53] BIuffwatcher: solved!
[1:59:53] SASTTV92: Huge love Xaryu! been watching you for a long time

[2:00:37] NawtyTyme: table for 2 ready for tyrannical gladiator
[2:00:38] ArkanisRP: may fav titles are the ones you got for having a top speed for challenge modes at the end of the expac
[2:00:42] Valvax: @grantgatz huuh
[2:00:44] DekRemzD: I feel SoD has a lot of complaints he's making, especially with progression. Gearing up in P1 has basically made most quest and dungeon drops until the late 30s useless and unrewarding. The same way the world feels too safe due to power creep. Still having a lot of fun on SoD though but I'm not used to it feeling this easy to level (as a War).
[2:00:44] malnourish_: id pay money she never once called u that :')
[2:00:51] taylorsdank: I bet no one in chat has the "Esteemed" title :)

[2:01:07] Lobbemate: are these retail graphics or what is it
[2:01:13] Doimos89: wait for the wounds
[2:01:14] MeatPuppet95: Pog im a badass hero now Pog
[2:01:22] SirGrindsAl0t: thank god for that

[2:01:29] adrianwinky: @Xaryu It's good to see a streamer with such a healthy lifestyle. Hope you live till 100 years old. Much blessings. You're an inspiration for people who want to become healthier
[2:01:31] Nicholas909: fr tho why are you skipping the tutorial then complaining that you're confused KEKW
[2:01:36] ItsBartell: usually you cant skip if its legit your first time through tho no?
[2:01:43] bralter: dont you have to do it once on the account before you can skip?
[2:01:43] taintalization: is this jimmy lol
[2:01:46] malnourish_: @ItsBartell correct
[2:01:52] SmugJerry: @taintalization sure is

[2:02:01] GlobetrotterFL: we don't want to be hero's we want to be players in a world of thousands
[2:02:08] azer0h: kinda but doing it normally has the same problem
[2:02:09] buhtterstick: ahh this is when I quit
[2:02:13] Ceptor90: What did Jaina do? xD
[2:02:13] TheTastyRamen: she killed her father right?
[2:02:15] azer0h: you just get called a hero later
[2:02:15] BIuffwatcher: elder scrolls music always used in wow vids haha
[2:02:16] flapeg: he played w3 tho so he should know
[2:02:23] Hobblets: BFA zones are pretty cool but the story does suck
[2:02:23] Endtree: @Nicholas909 you literally started watching this video right at this moment or you have hard time understanding
[2:02:24] AceOfFlame: @TheTastyRamen no she allowed the horde to kill her father
[2:02:24] BIuffwatcher: is good song
[2:02:24] Magnificus_445: BfA's areas themselves were beautiful
[2:02:29] RetikVEVO: she got those classic daddy issues
[2:02:29] Nerzoth: maybe with the AI voice acting development they will soon refer to you by the nickname
[2:02:34] gali5656: she betrayed her father in favor of the horde which ended with him getting killed
[2:02:37] TheTastyRamen: @AceOfFlame well minor detail xD
[2:02:37] zahron12: BFA Drustvar best story line EVER !!
[2:02:43] chu6kopekomela4kata: Hey Xar, what you gonna play today?
[2:02:49] DekRemzD: @flapeg Yeah, it's weird this was what he had an issue with after bringing up playing WC3 and the lore linking with WoW

[2:03:41] DiaDonnie: wait people like this exist?
[2:03:57] cucudrulo: You can note that he's alone for the whole experience, so It is no longer an MMO. It's an RPG with multiplayer instances :)

[2:07:35] MrAlease: MrAlease subscribed with Prime. 
[2:07:36] idkwhatodo: ad
[2:07:38] fernandorbretas: wow 2
[2:07:38] barkerdoa: thanks
[2:07:41] voncline88: They need to add PVP progresion systems
[2:07:42] fernandorbretas: new game
[2:07:43] likewizex: Retail sucks and is dead becuase of players like you who ditched and played any one of 6 other wows live - so its dead as fuck and boring
[2:07:44] Irotec_: we need the grafik in sod D:
[2:07:44] blazzedzz: Retail has to be purged
[2:07:44] BIuffwatcher: Argent Dawn/Moon Guard same Inn  <3
[2:07:45] glindes: Arena man
[2:07:50] nikodeemuz: sick dog solution end it
[2:07:50] imDigitalDave: Isn't it normal that after doing something for 20 years and seeing not so much innovation and true progression as the years drag on, to lose interest in the thing that you enjoyed for 20 years?
[2:07:54] thesirganks: I do feel like judging retail without looking at endgame at all wont give an accurate image
[2:07:57] AMLoogi: what’s wrong with playing a game having ur fun and quitting
[2:07:57] Wabbajack9: wipe everything and start over
[2:07:59] ipntheshower: The solution is SoD <3
[2:07:59] SnakeCodes: Re-do it again!
[2:08:02] acaman: new abilities to be found after hitting max.
[2:08:03] toddypoo: @Mico027 lol if you end it your probably kill classic too
[2:08:04] PuffnTuff: i like retail rn
[2:08:04] ebabilyasin2: retail dont need a fix , retail needs to end !!! enough is enough
[2:08:06] klugzy: Seasons of Discovery II
[2:08:10] Mapsize_: My take - they are ending wow with the world soul saga and then wow 2
[2:08:10] rast0s: clasic ++ then
[2:08:11] Hobblets: season of discovery is the same game as vanilla so far just with copy pasted spells from different xpacs
[2:08:14] RudyRube: then you do Season of Season of Discovery
[2:08:14] Quabbe: the solution is to end a game when its time
[2:08:15] GlobetrotterFL: the solution are consistent new seasonal servers. You are seeing it on every mmo.
[2:08:15] AmericanWarlord: maybe make a new game?
[2:08:16] GoodGriffey: League of Legends MMO will save us
[2:08:18] nyosbk: if you are a champion you should be badass like legion made us feel like
[2:08:18] zealwho: zealwho subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! waddup bro
[2:08:19] iStrudderz: osrs is starting to get to that point
[2:08:21] vilemerch: wipes like rust or ark ?
[2:08:24] grantgatz: grantgatz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[2:08:26] limburgse: Kara crypts 👀
[2:08:26] notcizion: in OSRS your old gear is used to make new gear keeps old content good
[2:08:27] Execrable1: that’s a problem for future me. screw that guy!
[2:08:27] rapulapaska: make new game from scratch
[2:08:29] SirGrindsAl0t: leveling through pvp Pog
[2:08:31] Endtree: EXPANSIONS SHOULD BE WAY SMALLER AND KEPT RELEVANT LONGER/
[2:08:33] taco_rob: time for wow 2
[2:08:36] PuffnTuff: SoD is all about the end game like retail is since the leveling is very limitied
[2:08:38] demotiiviert: well 6 year more to milk ^^ i guess
[2:08:40] DekRemzD: @Xaryu A lot of the Wrath and Retail complaints also apply to SoD. Power creep is making the world feel too safe. The progression is also less rewarding for people who played P1, going until 37-40 before getting upgrades from quests/dungeons.
[2:08:40] iamapottymouth: In fairness, SoD p1 was the same way
[2:08:42] GonTheOne: that's normal and happens for everygame lol
[2:08:43] ninetysix: no it wont run in into the same problem if everything is in azeroth @Xaryu
[2:08:44] SillyPanda: @Mapsize_ The problem with this is they're revamping old world. I doubt they'd spend the time if they were gonna build WoW 2 instead
[2:08:44] Saturos47: we pay subscriptions so why cant they keep devving and just go sod2
[2:08:44] ebabilyasin2: retail needs to finish !
[2:08:45] rocknsake: that's why ARPG make you reroll every few months for seasons
[2:08:46] saladasx: @Xaryu the solution is RP. hint: why didn't gta 5 die?
[2:08:46] Hobblets: there is nothing you can do really, imo anyways
[2:08:48] Zeroabrs: @Xaryu how do you feel about playing SOD with the new craze of false bans rn
[2:08:48] acaman: @xaryu new abilities to be found after hitting max. progression is the solution
[2:08:54] drdunning: theres an end to everything
[2:08:55] Sunashi_: My brothers loves retail. I don't think it is broken, I just think the player audience has changed. SoD should help recapture the rest
[2:08:55] Shut_Up_Jack: WOW 2
[2:08:57] Mayit: You make a new MMO using the same assets every 8 years or so
[2:08:57] Zarce: They need a reboot, WoW 2
[2:08:58] vilemerch: yearly wipe? bi yearly wipe?
[2:08:58] TheKidRobin: WoW 2 needs to happen, story needs to start over
[2:09:01] butthurtcream: world is not too safe lmao
[2:09:01] Krykoda: more blood elves will save it
[2:09:02] Valvax: i dont think they planned wow to go this far
[2:09:03] Xronik07: @GoodGriffey hopium
[2:09:04] Fourleaf_TV: STV starts 30 min
[2:09:05] RudyRube: ADD HOUSING
[2:09:06] Arnaud_191: im a new player should i go into classic or sod
[2:09:07] cucudrulo: The thing is that they shouldn't lose the essence of classic, which is the world.
[2:09:12] Elysianlight: the power creep is definitely real, people are doing like 300-400 dps at level 40
[2:09:14] barkerdoa: its funny were all here still debating how bad/good wow is. Why hasnt another MMO blown it out of the water yet after 20 years
[2:09:16] fetza108: i play retail and sod EZ
[2:09:17] Hobblets: @Arnaud_191 sod
[2:09:20] nemeuxs: can you link vid
[2:09:21] taylorsdank: honestly the most fun i have in retail is farming old content
[2:09:22] shukanara: instanced leveling for each expansion LUL
[2:09:24] GonTheOne: everything starts and dies eventualy it's life lol
[2:09:25] Xuranus83: next retail expansion would need to get rid of mob tagging to get players to interact again.
[2:09:26] lovekach: still not 60 cuh @Xaryu
[2:09:29] Fluid710: 1k dps as mage
[2:09:29] Shunmao: we need a way for it to make sense to complete the old content while leveling to the current max
[2:09:31] drewbuckler: It might seem dead in terms of streaming but people always play the game
[2:09:33] sunny_gee: wow on apple vision pro would be sick
[2:09:34] atomicblonde_pr: palword is killing wow lol
[2:09:35] quit84: @Elysianlight yeah but everythng has been scaled up - hp boosted- raids boosted
[2:09:37] nickylas: gnomer has been hard though
[2:09:39] lossietv: @Xaryu don't feel bad for being low level stlll, im playing as much as i can and im 38 and a half :) enjoying my time brotha
[2:09:41] darknighht257: you watching Jimmy?! Pog
[2:09:41] nikodeemuz: they have their focus all over the place with retail being still a thing and cant make a decent product
[2:09:42] vilemerch: yearly bi yearly wipes
[2:09:42] RaizenHQ: This still image is too funny
[2:09:43] Hobblets: classic will never have hard raids because the playerbase is mostly dads
[2:09:43] scheldethedoctor: IF roleplay was such a great thing, why are most ppl playing on pvp servers?
[2:09:43] FrostEmVP: We gotta add VOIP to wow and make it an RP only thing xD make it a gta but wow @xaryu
[2:09:43] nickylas: @atomicblonde_pr it was but not sod numbers
[2:09:44] parkrangerpeter: chat going to fast for xaryu to read this message
[2:09:45] AmericanWarlord: overwatch mmo
[2:09:49] 0_kreaz: Nah
[2:09:49] Fluid710: lol
[2:09:49] NAT0_141: retail gets fixed by brining back Chris Metzen and rolling out three new expansion sets @xaryu
[2:09:53] malnourish_: lol
[2:09:53] RingersRealm: NO
[2:09:54] Herzenliegen: No its not LUL
[2:09:54] chubstah007: 40 yet Cuh
[2:09:55] PublisherNA: elden ring kills wow @Xaryu
[2:09:57] 1shabbymn: Gnomer felt like it was in a good spot
[2:09:57] Neffehh: no?
[2:09:57] ChillyHTX: palworld sodaOmega
[2:09:58] PuffnTuff: Palworld LUL
[2:09:59] SirGrindsAl0t: yeah fuck wipes
[2:10:00] fanniclap: palaworld LOL
[2:10:02] barkerdoa: lol
[2:10:02] YuraruY: idk if its cope but im just waiting for riot MMO
[2:10:02] Ddocz: palworld kek
[2:10:02] GonTheOne: ye LUL
[2:10:03] Stranger2107: LUL
[2:10:03] wprogress: It is like saying Counter Strike is killing WoW LUL
[2:10:04] juuno106: the actual gameplay needs to be fun -- I think retail is actually most fun in that sense
[2:10:04] bhixx: wipes in wow are dumb
[2:10:05] detourz28: Yeah fuck that
[2:10:06] hutchyy917: 5k viewers nice. we all home bc of snow?
[2:10:07] DendeDewd: More wast8ing our time by wiping no ty
[2:10:07] darknighht257: love that mans content
[2:10:08] i_am_cakes: no thank you. i already have tarkov and that game sucks enough
[2:10:10] taylorsdank: they kinda do that already with expansion
[2:10:10] cryptxghost: new game
[2:10:10] imDigitalDave: Escape From Tarkov fans thinking wipes annually are a good idea Kappa
[2:10:10] bhixx: just make fresh servers
[2:10:10] Herzenliegen: Lmfao
[2:10:12] Drragos21: wipes ? lul this aint EFT
[2:10:12] tookotron: fresh realms
[2:10:14] MitoriSama: SOLUTION : imagine after every expansion, they put like at least 30-40 new levels, it takes the same time as classic leveling and then there is end game content
[2:10:15] W00KIEEJUNKY: no
[2:10:17] appleflirt: We need Wow 2
[2:10:17] shukanara: no character wipes, but maybe exp resets
[2:10:17] 0_kreaz: Palworld is dying
[2:10:17] frederikv225: we don't
[2:10:19] BigBoxx91: yeah i wouldnt play if they wiped my shit every year
[2:10:19] W00KIEEJUNKY: we need SOD only
[2:10:19] Stranger2107: we just need wow 2
[2:10:21] Herzenliegen: We dont need more
[2:10:21] Hobblets: new expansions will not fix the current problem lol, I dont think there is a solution
[2:10:23] Craigumander: its a quick rush to finish a story before UE5 new wow. Kappa
[2:10:23] zealwho: we need a big reset and a new GAME @Xaryu no fixing the current one
[2:10:24] Sunashi_: retail isn't broken, just has a different audience now. SoD will help recapture the original audience @Xaryu
[2:10:25] wreck561: its time for wow 2
[2:10:25] i_am_cakes: @imDigitalDave am fan, am not fan of wow wipes.
[2:10:27] ChillyHTX: if it has major pruning and rework maybe
[2:10:27] nickylas: WoW 2 WoW 2 WoW 2 WoW 2 WoW 2 WoW 2 WoW 2 WoW 2
[2:10:28] LukeyBTV: @Xaryu IS IT TIME FOR WOW 2?
[2:10:29] Krykoda: another cataclysm that destroys lands and reshapes the world, allowing us to start with all the races and characters in a new azerpth
[2:10:31] draxanlee: Lateral progression
[2:10:32] Doimos89: do we need new games or is it the opposite of what we need?
[2:10:32] Xronik07: wow2
[2:10:34] spaceghost_green: I love about retail that (if youre good enough) you can do content that not everyone is able to and though this have better gear etc than other (less skilled) players have, its not like everyone can do everything and get everything
[2:10:34] krakenunleashedtv: @Xaryu Classic+ with expansions every THREE years, not two.
[2:10:34] reallyeric: @hutchyy917 no he just gets 5k viewers on the daily
[2:10:35] hutchyy917: they already announced the title of next 3 xpacs
[2:10:35] acaman: @xaryu we need new abilities after hitting max. Not just gear. New areas too
[2:10:36] Endtree: @barkerdoa well most mmos are dying in a sense, they are jsut not going anywhere and get better over time. i can imagine in 20 years there will be very few mmorpg players.
[2:10:37] RaizenHQ: They need to just make WoW 2 next gen...1000 year time skip
[2:10:37] Meanpandah: retail needs to get rid of dailies
[2:10:37] ninetysix: keep everything new in both continents @Xaryu
[2:10:39] kindaopmusic: same thing with COD
[2:10:39] not_hazyy_: i think they should add an i game library that they incorporate into the tutorial and explains the main history
[2:10:39] codyc318: retail needs communism
[2:10:40] nickylas: wow2 is for sure the solution
[2:10:41] MrAlease: Wow devs need to learn how to do horizontal content not vertical.
[2:10:41] nickylas: start fresh
[2:10:42] barkerdoa: do you think were all just burnt out from playing a 20 year game and refuse to believe it and are keeping our beloved on life support @xaryu
[2:10:43] TrumpWallWorker: I think those three xpacs are to close story loops and end it all. Then relaunch a WoW2
[2:10:43] paraflashtv: i have the solution if u let me explain
[2:10:44] chr47: WoW 2 would be great tbh
[2:10:44] Wretched_Pium: we dont need it, but nex xpac gives alot of money to them and we buy it, so..
[2:10:46] zealwho: kill both games and make a new one LOL
[2:10:46] SoScrumpy: perfect time for ashes of creation
[2:10:49] Ddocz: what if they gave our money back for the expansions and reset everything lul
[2:10:49] Dsniper11A: FREE TO PLAY** only fix
[2:10:49] atomicblonde_pr: they need to remove quest traking like classic wow
[2:10:50] Greencaps07: doesnt is seem Jimmy's problem with retail is that he wants to know the story. Blizzard needs to make a single player game for the story @Xaryu
[2:10:51] fetza108: i just play solo retail
[2:10:51] ItsBartell: make retail free to play - implement a battlepass to make $. you gain xp for doing bgs/arena/dungeons/raids for battlepass - they need to bring players back and no one wants to spend $16 a month to do so...
[2:10:51] hutchyy917: @reallyeric huh. thought he floated around 2k during the day. nice
[2:10:53] Seibi92: retail needs a hard reset
[2:10:53] AmericanWarlord: new expansion Murloc Island!!!
[2:10:53] ebabilyasin2: retail needs to end finish dead !SOD = WOW 2 BETA
[2:10:53] Xronik07: wow2 refunded
[2:10:57] CurryOnPoint: i think they will revamp retail after the world soul saga then wow2 comes @xaryu because the last addon of the world soul saga is happening in northend
[2:10:58] Ezrathexton: @xaryu i think they should say "go agane, heres wow 2"
[2:10:59] FIREMAGZZ: L A G
[2:10:59] antriebswellen: yo
[2:11:01] SirGrindsAl0t: wow is 1 big server Pog
[2:11:05] macjcool: what if they just moved the mobs so the bots would be more visable
[2:11:05] C33bap: GET RID OF ALL ADDONS
[2:11:05] handovdoom666: people who like retail will continue to play retail. people who want to play classic will continue to play classic
[2:11:05] alvar_j: yes
[2:11:06] ItsGigabud: Less servers less layers
[2:11:07] EXiTxi: Layering
[2:11:09] gamedemon010: Yeah 1 mega server
[2:11:09] ScryerTV: or like runescape u can choose server
[2:11:11] grimmlols: they need to just make a new game
[2:11:11] NoodlePersonagain: i think that they are in the next exp @Xaryu
[2:11:12] Skovor: They should constantly bring content for classic wow like hardcore, sod, maybe arena a bit sooner, new islands but with classic lvl caps
[2:11:13] blazzedzz: There's to much shit in retail for anything to matter
[2:11:14] klaymiester: lafff
[2:11:15] JaneSylph: retail is more toxic nowadays than in 2004
[2:11:16] Valvax: exactly
[2:11:17] TheDeavs: GW2 mega servers
[2:11:17] quagmyer13: I like it
[2:11:17] SadVato: Seasonal content is the future, for both retail and classic
[2:11:19] C33bap: No addons = massive wow comeback
[2:11:21] Awokanwarrior: maybe nmot packed but enough
[2:11:22] clearscreen: It isnt the game. its the playerbase. Be honest there is so much stuff to do in wow. But most people just want to do the stuff that we all race to finish as fast as we can then complain when there is nothing to do
[2:11:22] malnourish_: their world events are already janky as hell with it layered on retail
[2:11:23] TheDeavs: Check out how GW2 does it
[2:11:24] sutakomet: sharding? it is literally in game already
[2:11:26] christiangodwarrior97: its called megaservers and thats what gw2 does
[2:11:26] JaneSylph: it will never work
[2:11:28] akaDace: They should adopt runescapes world system. where you join a world on login
[2:11:28] 3verythingatonce: i feel like they killed the world in world of warcraft. more people isnt the solution its being able to build relationships with the people in the world
[2:11:28] Hobblets: retail isnt really toxic outside of the M+ scene
[2:11:29] Xytho: Its the same team making the game.  wont get any better until its a new team or company.
[2:11:29] LukeyBTV: @Xaryu WOW 2 - REMOVE GROUP FINDER
[2:11:29] DekRemzD: @Xaryu I play on Argent Dawn (RP EU) and that's the way it feels
[2:11:30] PeeDub1969: If you don't have to work together, then you won't work together
[2:11:30] qaspard: you don't because there is no need to
[2:11:31] MonCota: exactly!!!
[2:11:31] ManyTriangles: dang just got here i love jimmy and was waiting for wow creators to see this vid
[2:11:32] C33bap: get rid of addons
[2:11:33] neighbor220: I think a lot of people got better at wow by redoing it all. Ive learned stuff about professions or other characters that i never knew before. maybe that helps us merge back to retail
[2:11:35] AnyroadTwo: way less servers, but servers are so important to have. they’re a community in Classic.
[2:11:36] handovdoom666: i play retail and interact with people all the time
[2:11:37] PublisherNA: they don't have those kind of servers even when you get world buffs it's laggy as hell @Xaryu
[2:11:38] Whitemamba236: "WTS Mythic Fyrrak kill 200k gold!
[2:11:39] Greencaps07: cause your to over powered to need others
[2:11:39] AmericanWarlord: retail is weird af
[2:11:42] lizardsoup69: cleanup the older systems and remove them conpletely. for example bfa hearth of azeroth or island expos @Xaryu
[2:11:43] fetza108: i play retail solo and with people sod
[2:11:47] fanghorn: The solution is content handled by AI to make the world ever evolving and dynamic. Quests, vilains, economy, wars, etc. That way it becomes a never ending game and you can finally forfeit on real life.
[2:11:47] BigBoxx91: half the time u dont want to interact with people on retail lol
[2:11:48] PuffnTuff: you make friends on retail that you play with, i dont know anyone i play with irl
[2:11:48] toddypoo: you only pvped xaryu of course you didnt interact
[2:11:49] TransMutedMaya: chat since they nerfed boomkin and resto, should i go feral or level my priest?
[2:11:49] Xuranus83: get rid of mob tagging, force people to party
[2:11:50] peardraxz: you not watching the rav video?!
[2:11:51] RaizenHQ: that club scene in Goldshire was POG
[2:11:51] Endtree: HAIL WOOKIE
[2:11:53] wlzzard_: will it be on you tube xar? just got here
[2:11:55] herd_of_llamas: didnt finish the goldshire party sequence Sadge
[2:11:57] ItsBartell: making retail free will solve a ton of problems... people will 100% come back to play
[2:12:01] ObrezKnight: @AmericanWarlord people who play it, even weirder
[2:12:01] xzotropic: its like call of duty, the drop a new game but the concept its the same. wow needs new content but old content needs the remain the same. I hâte grind new gear over and over. they need to do maybe new specs and  force ppl to try new ways of playing with same content
[2:12:02] LoosieJuice: @clearscreen absolutely spot on... rushing to max level like a sweatlord takes a game that should last you amonth and reduces it to a few days... ppl be crazy blaming blizzard for their own lack of impulse control
[2:12:06] shukanara: I feel like they should just trim the fat and remove chromie / region lock players to the new expansions. The old stories already happened and they should maybe just stay in the past
[2:12:07] chubstah007: 40 yet cuh?
[2:12:07] 3verythingatonce: need less people in the world so you can actually see them more then one time in all of your playtime
[2:12:09] AbyssReborn: they killed balance druid
[2:12:10] christiangodwarrior97: @TransMutedMaya stop being a pansy
[2:12:13] swavo_suave: boom!
[2:12:14] Hobblets: was a good video, j1mmy is one of the best osrs content creators
[2:12:15] Bitis: The dungeon finder system was a double edged sword. Made it easy to form groups, destroyed the community aspect of the game.
[2:12:15] Nerzoth: as a beginning I would get rid of every scaling-phasing-sharding-cross-server mechanic and return to unite world with single phase, combine low pop servers
[2:12:15] Ignite_CLO: the only reason people dont interact with each other on retail is because they dont want to .. there is nothing that stops you from interacting with people
[2:12:17] kindaopmusic: cross plat
[2:12:17] williwhite94: more micro trans
[2:12:17] barkerdoa: TRheres enough player data to train AI to behave just like real players and fill the world up
[2:12:21] RaizenHQ: They just need to make WOW2 next gen...1000 year time skip
[2:12:30] qaspard: wow being free is the worst possible solution Bedge
[2:12:32] Sydwase: F2P is the death of any MMO
[2:12:32] LukeyBTV: @Xaryu only 34? did you die and delete?
[2:12:32] quagmyer13: Did a two party pug quest clear last night after only playing wow classic for 5 hours and over 50 hours on retail and never happened
[2:12:33] ChiCity312: 1 Character and lv 34?
[2:12:39] Snorlax_King: @barkerdoa they already do it in retail with follower dungeons
[2:12:44] malnourish_: im convinced anyone who talks about wow being dead doesnt play the game
[2:12:46] iheartmywife: @ChiCity321 xar enjoyin the journey big dog
[2:12:46] 3verythingatonce: @Nerzoth i agree i want to know the people on my server.
[2:12:48] williwhite94: @barkerdoa they actully have that in a BG thing for AB but they blow cuz they have their skill set to low
[2:12:50] not_hazyy_: @raizenhq not a bad idea
[2:12:53] hotshotlester: i agree. I'd keep playing if it was free, or even just less than $15 a month. Can't justify it with limited play time with a family, but certainly miss playing
[2:12:55] Smozku: @RaizenHQ straight to starcraft
[2:12:57] swoopydk: ANELE
[2:12:59] SnakeCodes: Thats pretty good idea, many MMO use "instances" idea, not like wow that has directly servers. Could be instances with player limit, the problem would be features like retail crafting ordes of stuff that are global
[2:13:00] Buckshot_LeFonque: dont forget darnassus port today! @Xaryu
[2:13:04] KronicKorey: youre doing bloodmoon without being lvl 40?
[2:13:05] HogwartsLegacyOfficial: get a gallon
[2:13:07] lossietv: how much exp does BFD give if im level 38?
[2:13:11] iamapottymouth: is that  a nalgene bottl?
[2:13:12] DiaDonnie: what do you get from the event?
[2:13:17] antriebswellen: i think this year will be hard for all old mmos, because there are so much releases, like ashes of creation, thrones of liberty, path of exile 2 and and, my forecast is, wow/blizzard will die this year xD
[2:13:22] imDigitalDave: I love the memories I have from WoW, but would it really be so bad if eventually Blizz goes "We've done all we can and more for this fantasy we created, and its time to let it rest"?
[2:13:37] lossietv: how much exp does BFD give if im level 38 if any?
[2:13:43] LJimbox: @RaizenHQ  that would be pretty cool - it'd be pretty sick if you could 'prestige' your account - and your new toons are from the same 'lineage' as your original
[2:13:43] Hoothly: @imDigitalDave leave
[2:13:45] quagmyer13: Don't forget to check your monitors for 144 hrts
[2:13:49] wprogress: @antriebswellen Ashes will come out and like 5 years prob
[2:13:50] ehweron: gaming will die this year
[2:13:50] mistamang: @lossietv like 20k
[2:13:58] Ddocz: “800ml” americans: what???! get a 55-baseball per Orange container, way better
[2:14:10] Endtree: MMOS will die in 10/20 years
[2:14:16] antriebswellen: @wprogress ok then the other hyped mmos
[2:14:20] Absolute_96: @Endtree so will you...
[2:14:24] ColbaeTV: Listening
[2:14:31] roxtempo: ban this guy
[2:14:36] nikodeemuz: ban
[2:14:40] ItsBartell: they need people to return thats there #1 problem in retail. theres never going to be a perfect world no matter how you slice it. they could have a battle pass each season to make money. sell more consmetics in the shop ect. no one wants to spend $16 a month when every other decent game is free to play after initial purchase...
[2:14:42] williwhite94: tbh i think AI will replace the ability to have to use keyboards we will be able to go in the game like some movie type shit
[2:14:43] mctwist__: @Ddocz 55-baseball per orange container?  you're getting ripped off my man.  Who's your water guy?   I can get sixteen football fields divided by a chicken tender for the same price
[2:15:02] Endtree: gen z is not polaying wowe and all you grandpas and grandmas are the last players of wow
[2:15:04] PringleV2: !realm
[2:15:09] Crunchee: xaryu pls come back soon and save us from bad takes
[2:15:09] Ddocz: @mctwist__ i actually spat my water out bahahahah good one
[2:15:10] iamapottymouth: best way to get players excited about retail is to take away some of the QoL. I'm sorry, but the reason players stay in classic so much longer is because it takes longer
[2:15:19] cabeshpash: all the have to do it retail is make old world content relevant again
[2:15:21] ColbaeTV: Listening
[2:15:27] buckobean: SOmrbody ba that guy Kek
[2:15:32] Shuttlelol: @Endtree there are a bunch of 16-24 year olds playing WoW, wtf you talking about you bum
[2:15:37] lizardsoup69: Best to do for Blizzard Cleanup older systems and remove or rework them completely would be a first step. Socket gear, azerite gear or older expansion professions. Make them so they fit in the current expansion or delete them.
[2:15:38] SkinniestGoblin: @endtree I’m Gen Z and I play WoW XD
[2:15:41] SirGrindsAl0t: delusional andies in chat LUL
[2:15:44] buckobean: Endtree
[2:15:44] NAT0_141: what really needs to addressed by WoW is the toxicity created by item level or achievement progression. people wanting to play and run dungeons but can’t because the party leader won’t give them a chance. created a more solo game over the years and continues in every facet of the game @xaryu
[2:15:51] FIREMAGZZ: I PUT X ON MY STEAK
[2:15:51] Frahar: his name rhymes with plasmongold
[2:15:52] Endtree: @Shuttlelol yeah, but not enoguh for sure dum
[2:15:53] SirGrindsAl0t: yeah endtree is delusional af
[2:15:54] Ervill1: different opinion = bad take LUL flakes
[2:15:55] pixx3i: !talents
[2:15:56] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[2:15:56] lossietv: how much exp does BFD give if im level 38?
[2:15:57] Snorlax_King: wait add
[2:15:58] quagmyer13: They said it would die 10 years ago
[2:16:00] GallowayOW: ad
[2:16:01] tuster12: i think...... ads
[2:16:01] lossietv: @mistamang oh thank you
[2:16:01] tryxiemage: @Endtree this guy
[2:16:04] Ready_to_Squeeze: i think...add
[2:16:07] Cross86: WoW 2 easy fix
[2:16:08] AceOfFlame: @iamapottymouth uh no? Most people in classic era hate alot of the things that DOESNT have good qol
[2:16:09] GeryKhan: What would be the best talent build for pvp Xar ? Any suggestions already ?
[2:16:11] Cross86: Kappa
[2:16:12] fellifell: all they need to do is pay us to play duh ez fix
[2:16:14] lossietv: HUH
[2:16:14] dwoj0: if it were easy their would be better mmos by now
[2:16:15] Zarce: Ads Sadge
[2:16:17] nikodeemuz: what great take fucker LUL jokes on u addblock
[2:16:17] miceralol: HUH
[2:16:17] iamapottymouth: "Heres what I think" Ad starts
[2:16:17] ansgot: If it was simple Blizzard would have done it already
[2:16:17] dawnovun: When are you returning to retail bro
[2:16:18] ralphh1541: HUH
[2:16:18] cabeshpash: LUL LUL LUL
[2:16:18] zurdazo1: messi
[2:16:18] ColbaeTV: gachiHYPER
[2:16:19] Xuranus83: when was the last fun expansion?
[2:16:23] OrganikCum: just make it simple
[2:16:24] Crunchee: @Endtree pmuch yeah, the multiple diff people saying mmos would die
[2:16:28] vilemerch: Path of exile does it well. Current Seasonal stuff that parks all characters in a default version of the game. and every 6 months you gotta make new characters for the seasonal content
[2:16:30] antriebswellen: when thrones of liberty release?
[2:16:31] tittle491: Bro bit us with 6 ads in 5 mins lol
[2:16:31] ehweron: how to save wow: boob slider
[2:16:31] vak_hunt: its damn near impossible
[2:16:32] EXiTxi: Something you want to eat with a napkin
[2:16:34] Skwidlegs: here's all they have to do.. just revolutionize the mmo genre
[2:16:34] christiangodwarrior97: just make the game good
[2:16:34] SirGrindsAl0t: wow has been poppin since 2004 it is now 2024 you are delusional if you think wow is gonna die anytime soon
[2:16:34] fellifell: if they just paid us to play we would all play am I wrong?!
[2:16:35] lossietv: its sticky af
[2:16:35] iamapottymouth: @AceOfFlame You have obviously not played classic
[2:16:37] Nerzoth: as a beginning I would get rid of every scaling-phasing-sharding-cross-server mechanic and return to unite world with single phase, community-based. combine low pop servers @Xaryu
[2:16:41] nyosbk: mmos in general are tricky we aren’t the same gamers we were in 2004
[2:16:41] ItsBartell: no matter how you slice it itll never make everyone happy...
[2:16:42] Guiza4: its messi, fuck that guy
[2:16:44] SirGrindsAl0t: we will be dead before wow dies LUL
[2:16:44] bigholyd: Get the missile barrage rune
[2:16:47] dawnovun: @Xaryu return to retail arena
[2:16:48] Shadowfell_: @Xaryu How is it not easy solution, if 90% of WOW problems were always easily fixed but took several major patches to do for them ??? :D
[2:16:54] fanghorn: @Xaryu The solution is content handled by AI to make the world ever evolving and dynamic. Quests, vilains, economy, wars, etc. That way it becomes a never ending game and you can finally forfeit on real life.
[2:16:56] largist_: all changes have bitterfly effect
[2:16:59] vak_hunt: now you have league of warcraft
[2:17:00] atomicblonde_pr: i play alot of mmo and always end here in wow again lol
[2:17:05] chrislu18: WoW will always have highs and lows built in. As long as they keep innovating and creating fresh content people will continue playing
[2:17:08] Hobblets: I embrace AI
[2:17:10] wanksterwow: retail just has too much bloat at this point
[2:17:12] AceOfFlame: @AceOfFlame you obviously actually haven't. If people wanted everything to be "longer" nobody would sweat spamming SM to max lvl and abusing the STV event. you have no idea what your on about or just inserting what you like onto others
[2:17:13] nkn8960: leage of leagends have over 50 + champs
[2:17:14] DiaDonnie: you say that now
[2:17:14] Haematopodidae: fuck ai games
[2:17:17] DiaDonnie: give it 10 years
[2:17:20] quagmyer13: Overwatch
[2:17:21] aut0p1lot: so far
[2:17:21] williwhite94: we need to work WITH AI no use one or the other
[2:17:25] Mint_Robot: Multiverse is Hollywood's way to make new storylines that can be isolated and won't have to be shoehorned into the lore. idk about classes though
[2:17:27] rakez1405: rakez1405 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:17:28] ehweron: I would never play an AI-"created" piece of content
[2:17:28] hurkaderkadoo: I think it just needs a total reset
[2:17:33] jellymann: if you could change 3 thing’s immediately about retail, what would they be?
[2:17:34] nyosbk: simplicity and rewarding grind
[2:17:37] fellifell: the solution is for them to just pay us to play ez clap
[2:17:37] Nerzoth: as a beginning I would get rid of every scaling-phasing-sharding-cross-server mechanic and return to unite world with single phase, community-based. combine low pop servers. also single raid difficulty @Xaryu
[2:17:40] BokacT: @Xaryu what do you think about every expac having like separate levels? for example, you can play cata 1-40, legion 1-40 etc
[2:17:43] timeless_potato: MMEOWDY  MMEOWDY
[2:17:43] PeeDub1969: trader joe's only has like three brands of each product and people love trader joe's
[2:17:46] jacksunson: example of an purely AI generated game?
[2:17:47] Cuddle_Bunz: I think we know what needs to change, it’s more about how to change it. how do you recenter the game on social interactions while preserving the high skill competitive elements in such a complicated and sometimes convoluted world
[2:17:51] philuhp: !followage
[2:17:51] jellymann: if you could change 3 thing’s immediately about retail, what would they be? @xaryu
[2:17:51] StreamElements: @philuhp, philuhp has been following xaryu for  10 years 5 months 30 days 12 hours
[2:17:55] Endtree: @SirGrindsAl0t it\s not gonna die anytime soon, but mmos are not going anywhere and younger generations get less and less into this genre
[2:17:56] emagill97: we should press blizzard into making a new player voted on class to like Phase 4
[2:17:56] SirGrindsAl0t: KEKW
[2:17:58] maobueno2211: hola
[2:18:01] lossietv: lossietv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 4 months for the goat
[2:18:05] williwhite94: @BokacT that is chromie XD
[2:18:16] skippyxox: seems like the problem is blizz isn't willing to "wipe" the content created by previous expansions which no one really plays in retail. content should be expansion specific and then yeeted in retail. no one is going back and playing shadowlands content.
[2:18:22] jellymann: if you could change 3 thing’s immediately about retail, what would they be?
[2:18:22] thebigpero123: @Xaryu best suggestions to grow leg mass? im fit and strong but i cant get size on em to save my life
[2:18:24] Hobblets: there is no fix for it
[2:18:27] cabeshpash: retail would be way more fun if they just scaled up all the old world content and gave new rewards for it
[2:18:29] FIREMAGZZ: WE NEED WOW 2 IN VR
[2:18:32] Herzenliegen: To much bloat
[2:18:32] Jupiter_rah: Fuck all pc games give me a full dive MMO like from ready player one or SAO
[2:18:34] Ervill1: remove old shit
[2:18:36] taylorsdank: go farm 100 exalted reps achieve and you'll unlock the true retail WoW
[2:18:37] DigDirector: The issue is that the content is repeatable low quality content.
[2:18:38] ItsBartell: if you had to, what do you think the top 3 issues in Wow right now are Xar?
[2:18:39] Blehbeh03: what ab having to create a new char every expansion? everyone would have a ''fresh start''
[2:18:41] vas7_live: you rush trough content after you reach 60
[2:18:41] antriebswellen: what yu think @Xaryu will wow die this year cause of big mmos get release
[2:18:42] nyosbk: a new mmo maybe?
[2:18:42] Haematopodidae: the answer is WoW2
[2:18:43] hheinsoo: I feel nowadays ppl play multiple games at the same time. People dont want to  pay subscription for a game you want to casually jump into
[2:18:43] imDigitalDave: I feel like the massive amount of content creates a sort of choice paralysis where people have so many options they end up deciding to just do nothing
[2:18:44] kindaopmusic: wow2
[2:18:45] nikodeemuz: nobody talks about wow token anymore its so huge problem too
[2:18:47] dugy6: reset
[2:18:47] gmazca: They need foundational change. Starting with the leveling process
[2:18:50] GallowayOW: the fix is dont play retail lol
[2:18:50] J0yBoy20: @FIREMAGZZ nah dude
[2:18:50] atarri1: Issue is getting new players
[2:18:51] christiangodwarrior97: they are always adding new stuff instead of perfecting things in the game
[2:18:54] jamonspk: jamonspk subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[2:18:55] DrBobSteve: I tried to play retail a few months ago, and there's like going back in time and the timeline is all so confusing, I couldn't get into it
[2:18:57] emosoda: wow2 the solution?
[2:19:01] Mangled_Squeegee: ashes of creation

[2:19:12] AnyroadTwo: lol ashes
[2:19:13] Snorlax_King: the only MMO that will kill WoW is WoW itself

[2:19:21] fanghorn: @jacksunson Doesnt really exist yet but you can check out chatgpt linked to skyrim. Not sure I like it but that's were a lot of things a headed in the future. The channel 2 minute papers covers things like that.

[2:19:24] Jupiter_rah: forget all mmo's give us full dive MMO like SAO or ready player one
[2:19:27] DiaDonnie: Honestly the only MMO thats gonna kill wow, is wow, and its doing a pretty good job of it already xd
[2:19:28] lossietv: @Xaryu HEAR ME OUT, I think tutorial island shouldn't have been what it is, I think it should've been like 1-20, and it's a rundown of the expansions and major storylines that have passed, kind of like how MoP had the lorewalker telling us of the past
[2:19:30] EXiTxi: Ashes will never come out, has an infinite dev timeline lul
[2:19:30] Hobblets: I am worried that the Riot MMO being overhyped will only lead to disappointment
[2:19:30] sharky_exp: @Xaryu ashes aint coming out lol they been working on that game for 90 years
[2:19:30] SirGrindsAl0t: ashes wont even put a dent in wow

[2:19:41] BOOSTx_x: SHAMANSS
[2:19:41] Sydwase: AoC's pvp system will turn most retail players off, won't kill WoW
[2:19:42] peardraxz: warlocks are trash tier

[2:19:49] GallowayOW: ele shamans are nuts too
[2:19:51] lossietv: @Xaryu HEAR ME OUT, I think tutorial island shouldn't have been what it is, I think it should've been like 1-20, and it's a rundown of the expansions and major storylines that have passed, kind of like how MoP had the lorewalker telling us of the past. I think that would be awesome
[2:19:52] skitna: shaman EZ
[2:19:53] wprogress: Ashes will prob flop, doesnt look good at all yet

[2:20:04] cabeshpash: despite what people say about it, retail is still the most popular MMORPG out right now by a mile
[2:20:05] skippyxox: i don't think we'd ever really have a "wow killer". people are too attached to the IP.
[2:20:05] underfearx: boomie is trash now
[2:20:05] HogwartsLegacyOfficial: sign me up
[2:20:07] Movu: Only thing that will kill WoW imo is WoW 2, and it doesn't seem like that will ever happen
[2:20:08] jellymann: if you could change 3 thing’s immediately about retail, what would they be?  @xaryu
[2:20:18] nightmodee: aquaman xaryu
[2:20:19] Gale_ryn: it would be fun if everything was relevant, all the dungeons raid and world content, but then all the people would be split all over the place
[2:20:20] Herzenliegen: LUL
[2:20:21] AbyssReborn: they f'd boomy
[2:20:21] lossietv: @Xaryu HEAR ME OUT, I think tutorial island shouldn't have been what it is, I think it should've been like 1-20, and it's a rundown of the expansions and major storylines that have passed, kind of like how MoP had the lorewalker telling us of the past that would be fun

[2:20:47] mrpici: sup gamer. someone said mages get deep freeze in sod did i get baited?
[2:20:48] underfearx: @gmazca and you can’t cast so how you kill people before dying?
[2:20:49] williwhite94: starsurge is nerfed but starfire is buffed by 66% boomie is still S tier lol
[2:20:53] lossietv: True but at least it'll help get people up to speed
[2:20:55] nikodeemuz: @jellymann remove wow token lfr and layers
[2:20:56] Nerzoth: as a beginning I would get rid of every scaling-phasing-sharding-cross-server mechanic and return to unite world with single phase, community-based. combine low pop servers. also single raid difficulty @Xaryu
[2:21:00] sauceboifredo: get rid of all the buttons and put it on next gen console and problem solved
[2:21:01] AbyssReborn: @williwhite94 you must not play boomy then

[2:21:04] thesirganks: I see more people on the starter island then anywere else while leveling tbh
[2:21:07] feelwoozy: hows faction balance feel?
[2:21:08] Reafian: Would removing chromie and removing content for a limited time help? You could then reopen old content for a decent period of time and make the rewards super lucrative for new players and for old.
[2:21:09] gmazca: @darkmagi2 I feel like my ret paladin still slaps. definitely slept on
[2:21:09] SirGrindsAl0t: next phase COPIUM
[2:21:10] Am0n3r: that 3% experience buff seems to have worked negative on your progress.
[2:21:10] OGTigolebitties: yeah I feel whoever said the comment about locks feeling rough pvp… you literally have to be in Meta
[2:21:10] lamb0chop: Whats everyones preferred lean level of their ground beef
[2:21:14] underfearx: @garzag_ it doesn’t do 700 dmg lol only if it crits.
[2:21:16] Snorlax_King: i dont play retail like a MMO i play it like a single playing Que up experience and the open world is the lobby
[2:21:17] NotoriousTWIG: @williwhite94 Starfire crits less often and has a long cast time
[2:21:18] budmodeos: Xaryu you see Guzu’s gnomeregan run? pretty fun to watch. should be awesome.
[2:21:18] williwhite94: @AbyssReborn i just read the notes man lol
[2:21:20] jiggyspice: weakest class in PH2 is warlock
[2:21:21] jay_deetv: @nikodeemuz 3 ways to kill wow if you do that
[2:21:22] eskeettiiit: daily proffesion quest wich send u back to lower lvl zones? feels more crowded and u meet more ppl
[2:21:25] Xaryu: as a beginning I would get rid of every scaling-phasing-sharding-cross-server mechanic and return to unite world with single phase, community-based. combine low pop servers. also single raid difficulty
[2:21:26] TheTastyRamen: deep freeze is gonna be p3 with runes on head or bracers
[2:21:26] Xaryu: as a beginning I would get rid of every scaling-phasing-sharding-cross-server mechanic and return to unite world with single phase, community-based. combine low pop servers. also single raid difficulty
[2:21:26] Kazunya_Meowryu: They just need to fix the eclipse rune with star fire
[2:21:26] Xaryu: as a beginning I would get rid of every scaling-phasing-sharding-cross-server mechanic and return to unite world with single phase, community-based. combine low pop servers. also single raid difficulty
[2:21:30] sharky_exp: sounds like a game crash
[2:21:30] Sunashi_: no way to roll that back on retail tho
[2:21:32] AbyssReborn: @williwhite94  no crap... its in game and it feels AWFUL and is not good
[2:21:34] internetrobot: @lamb0chop 80/20
[2:21:35] eusouomiranhal: !adoons
[2:21:36] outnilled: People who play end game content dont want a long and slow leveling process, new players and players who want story do. Somehow someone will be umhappy
[2:21:41] mrpici: thanks for the quick reply. caught a sub :)
[2:21:46] williwhite94: @AbyssReborn i do think they nerfed it way to much

[2:22:03] GallowayOW: event
[2:22:03] Djbunny162: I dont think you can remove shards/phases. Wont the hardware just crash? Like when Ashenvale had no layers
[2:22:03] Reaperz_kinetic: cause you’re on boat
[2:22:03] d0mezg4mer: single raid difficulty means lots of players never kill a raid boss. mythic raid too hard for many

[2:26:09] rainydaydaydream: my keybindings feel so cluttered
[2:26:09] Hobblets: what do you think about them giving priest shadowfiend without it taking up a rune slot?
[2:26:11] gmazca: keybinds are troublesome. especially with engineering
[2:26:12] GallowayOW: nah next phase is just to 50
[2:26:12] parabellum2213: and belt
[2:26:18] RudyRube: @Xaryu they said 9 total.  60 runes

[2:26:24] xirockux: shaman keybind is insane at 30
[2:26:28] EXiTxi: Why would they do that tho

[2:26:32] Hobblets: they did that
[2:26:34] dodingen: @AwakenRevelation link it or leave it
[2:26:35] sadgeski: Imagine being a warrior. You need 3-4 bars.
[2:26:36] naturalduck: why did they make priest so OP
[2:26:43] Maulo: its shadowfiend
[2:26:44] TheTastyRamen: I feel like abilities should only be pants, chest and helm and rest passive abilities

[2:27:33] iceysoda_: i like how you are really taking ur time leveling
[2:27:35] Kersed805: priest will be OP this phase and fall off a bit next phase

[2:27:44] Bizzylife: did i miss the xaryu react to rav most recent vid?
[2:27:50] dexatron9k: you need a grp
[2:27:51] Hobblets: shadow priest did need the mana regen but other classes like moonkin still have not had their mana issues addressed
[2:27:54] quagmyer13: I'm a healing priest lol
[2:27:56] kordellbennett: yeah why wouldn’t they get a improved Fort or something like the rest of the classes kinda whack
[2:27:57] Hobblets: for like starfire

[2:28:04] xNotorietyx: only 34 cuh??
[2:28:04] dexatron9k: and not being 40 you are going to get recked
[2:28:05] Slyxen: my main is 27, so...
[2:28:05] Maandresto: how is the mage right now? just started with SoD and am new to wow in general
[2:28:08] eli_deknight: Bro, why aren't you 40?
[2:28:10] JustMartin2004: xar why are u still level 34 bro?

[2:28:14] Stoneycarp: @Xaryu pvp is a 1shot zerg fest. best of luck my friend
[2:28:15] kodshin: yo but why 34 tho?
[2:28:15] oretez: You should try BDO and try out their Arena
[2:28:16] chasingshadowsz: WHY NOT 40 THO??
[2:28:17] cjadude: no shot
[2:28:17] shadowstorm_sod: I got 6 alt to get 40 I don't have time to slow lvl
[2:28:18] kodshin: LUL

[2:28:27] C0sm1cGaming: bro why you not in gnomer with full bis
[2:28:28] idothingsdaily: BFD today?
[2:28:28] Pyroque: Pyroque subscribed with Prime. 
[2:28:28] F3io: Chatting bro why not 40???
[2:28:28] NotASkiller: my friend has TWO kids and he's already 40... cmon Xar,
[2:28:31] maiex: whats the pvp event for p2?
[2:28:32] chr47: To be fair, the people playing on release couldn't quest if they wanted to
[2:28:33] kingt0s: @Maandresto if u're new it doesn't matter really. just explore the game
[2:28:34] Hobblets: warlock closet is one of the best additions to sod
[2:28:36] Goobadoobadoob: My mom is higher level than you ngl
[2:28:37] R7SOKA: @shadowstorm_sod so dedicated you rebranded your username after sod
[2:28:39] mini1mage: I was late to the game in p1, still got a bit bored toward the end. So im enjoying it and taking my time in p2
[2:28:42] pretty_cool_guy: guys he literally doesn't want to get 40 because he's enjoying the game
[2:28:49] seaent: do u think theyll add arena at 60?
[2:28:53] mickster111: Do you have your Student Fodder?  Would you save them for p3 / 4 or use them in P2?
[2:28:57] Hobblets: its also cool how non group members can use a warlock closet of same faction
[2:28:59] LJimbox: warlock closet is so OP, you dont even need to be in the party/raid with the warlock
[2:28:59] Roypatti: does it make sense to do the STV event if your not lvl 40?
[2:28:59] Zoismoe: i remember 34 on my first day ;)
[2:29:00] Andrettiixd: Warlock trash in pvp this phase though
[2:29:03] shadowstorm_sod: @r7soka nope joined twitch for sod
[2:29:03] wprogress: Chat thinks it is a competition to get to max lvl LULW
[2:29:05] cjadude: "enjoying the game" or turned into a casual
[2:29:07] knuuuunt: what is warlock closet
[2:29:09] plae007: @Xaryu  I just want them to make Proffs linkable to people dont fill chat with all the enchants they can do lol
[2:29:11] Curtsy: @seaent They said at blizzcon there are no plans for that
[2:29:13] randall_KTO: QoL stuff is always a win
[2:29:14] chubstah007: @xaryu Leveling this way preps you better for hardcore imo
[2:29:17] itstommy22: the shaman totem mover is bis quality of life
[2:29:22] Varieth: @Xaryu whats the bag addon you use?
[2:29:23] Kriehp: holy shit you have so many coins
[2:29:23] wippedy: why are you still level 34
[2:29:29] tattooedproductguy: @knuuuunt summon
[2:29:32] Rhaelarr: @Xaryu What bag addon are you using?
[2:29:33] Kersed805: if they work
[2:29:36] sailov: What bag addon is that?
[2:29:36] Maandresto: @kingt0s alrighty ^^ been doing it. playing wotlk with a friend for about 30 hours now
[2:29:38] pizac7: used mine 38-40
[2:29:43] epicalec333: how do we know they'll even work next phase
[2:29:43] Hobblets: I saved my nuggies but it wouldnt surprise me if blizz disables them for 40+
[2:29:48] LoosieJuice: baganator
[2:29:49] Gunnan22: Might not even work passed 40 just use them now
[2:29:50] hide1nbush1: @sailov Baganator
[2:29:52] Kriehp: @pizac7 thats the play
[2:29:54] mini1mage: I'd just use them and enjoy the game. They will probably have another buff later on
[2:29:54] pretty_cool_guy: actually playing and enjoying the game rather than thinking being 40 is important
[2:29:59] Canno92: I doubt they'll work -- They've taken a lot of steps to stop stacking this stuff, like with the WSG marks
[2:30:01] iceysoda_: I’m sure they will be something new for exp like that
[2:30:12] largist_: thre is always a chance blizz nerfs them on p3
[2:30:17] Lawpings: no, its melee hunter
[2:30:18] Canno92: Thought it was melee hunter!
[2:30:18] rainydaydaydream: firemage does insane dmg
[2:30:19] Hobblets: melee hunter
[2:30:19] disorient00: no

[2:30:23] wprogress: No actually false
[2:30:24] rowdyrisk: no they aren't, lol
[2:30:24] kLipsiS: mele hunter is
[2:30:25] Shewis_: Warlock
[2:30:25] cheddarluca: it isnt
[2:30:27] Sneepur: Melee hunter and lock
[2:30:27] easynightjr: whats the difference from bagon and that other bag addon?
[2:30:28] camdougie: how you likin SOD p2 so far xar? have been enjoying it as warrior
[2:30:29] Majinbrew: fire is 2nd to melee hunter
[2:30:29] Hobblets: melee hunter spamming raptor strike on cd is best lol
[2:30:30] NutterCircus: Evo Scrolls bro KEKW
[2:30:32] ipntheshower: I was pumping last night as mut rogue in gknomer last night
[2:30:32] CousinAvi86: Its the boot rune, gives 50% more crit damage
[2:30:34] sailov: Is that not an alt?
[2:30:36] Sneepur: According to warcraft logs it's lock
[2:30:36] Mint_Robot: that 40% burn on crit talent is big
[2:30:38] Bromorin: bignite
[2:30:39] jeneraljelly: the #1 player overall is fire but melee hunter is doing better
[2:30:39] TransMutedMaya: melee hunter is top rn
[2:30:40] Slyxen: wait it isn't spriest after all that talk 2 mins ago?
[2:30:41] sailov: Are you only 34?
[2:30:42] kLipsiS: spellpower too
[2:30:45] kLipsiS: need that boot rune
[2:30:50] DJspookyghost: Sadge
[2:30:50] paulthecat: lock is number 1
[2:30:52] Hobblets: poor frost mage lol
[2:30:54] Azzael17: melee hunter being top over actual melee
[2:30:54] mini1mage: Yeah because we have enough points to get the % gain in the tree too this time around
[2:30:56] Azzael17: classic blizz
[2:30:57] iRayG2: lmao
[2:30:58] lukeclev: HOT STREAK BRO
[2:30:58] ansgot: Frost Sadge
[2:30:59] Ervill1: im a ret Aware nothing to look forward to Aware
[2:31:00] jiggyspice: warlock is F tier in pvp tho
[2:31:04] quagmyer13: First bag addon but a 20 years player... Sounds sus...
[2:31:04] randall_KTO: How are the resists against lvl 40 pvp?
[2:31:10] DPTDave: frost kinda makes sense that it doesn't do damage against machines/mechanical vs fire
[2:31:11] Mint_Robot: frost is better solo levelling when you need to kite and slow
[2:31:13] Herby_Here: OMEGALUL sure
[2:31:14] Curtsy: @jiggyspice LOL
[2:31:18] TransMutedMaya: @quagmyer13 bag addons are overrated
[2:31:23] zkikee7: for pvp is btter no'
[2:31:27] Lagbolta: Wasn't the blood moon a thing back in 2015?
[2:31:28] jiggyspice: @Curtsy we dont have instant cast oneshots.. auto F tier
[2:31:29] genitelius: what is better for leveling frost or fire`?
[2:31:30] Rill_: they gonna nerf meleee hunter before i even get to use it T.T
[2:31:31] FoleyGrail: lil 5 man BFD?
[2:31:37] Ervill1: is the BFD exp still good at this lvl??
[2:31:37] Cuddle_Bunz: MCCONNELL
[2:31:42] DJspookyghost: anyone know how ice shards stacks with Spell Power rune Hmm
[2:31:43] Curtsy: @jiggyspice It's okay to just say you're shit player bro
[2:31:49] seancyx: @Rill_ It was outrageous. outdpsing warr and rogue
[2:31:50] JustMartin2004: hey xar are you a dog person or  cat person
[2:31:51] AwakenRevelation: Xaryu already reacted to it, tried to link as you requested, struck down by mod. I tried, but it was a oldy but a goody.
[2:31:52] GallowayOW: they said they arent nerfing anything for a few weeks (except druids)
[2:31:54] Hobblets: is this crusader strike?
[2:31:58] the_augury: I don't know, maybe a little bit, they'll have their time in phase 4 in MC and BWL where everything has crazy FR. Frost mage will have their time in the sun again i'm sure.
[2:31:58] mickster111: Horde start in gromgol
[2:32:01] quagmyer13: @transmutedmaya  I'm jk and totally not. Love looking in my bank from anywhere
[2:32:02] karrots96: i personally like that Fire mage is designed for PVE, and Frost is designed for PVP. Keeps exploring multiple specs. Although the lack of duel spec makes it inacessible
[2:32:15] Pontaan93: mcconnell LUL
[2:32:24] razarn: mcconnell!
[2:32:25] quagmyer13: Lol McConnell
[2:32:26] jiggyspice: @Curtsy ph2 i sall about instant cast oneshots mate

[2:32:29] Herby_Here: blizz give us dual spec in p3 frfr
[2:32:40] dan_mcpherson: south west of you, by the coast
[2:32:41] randall_KTO: I heard your Warlock can get enslaved
[2:32:42] Fujinator: I wish frostfire spec with ignite and shatter/ice shards would be beter
[2:32:44] taylorsdank: @AwakenRevelation wasnt a mod you cant link if ur not subbed
[2:32:50] Lagbolta: mcretC mcretD mcretC
[2:32:58] Ervill1: melee hunter prob
[2:33:04] quagmyer13: It would be cool if I could lvl as shadow and dun. As holy
[2:33:10] ryaanshaw: what level do you start questin in STV?

[2:39:17] Curtsy: @riot7717 they dont need to buff warrior, they have been top dps for 20 years in classic, they can deal with being not OP right away in a phase
[2:39:23] naturalduck: starefire deserves that dmg
[2:39:23] ralphh1541: still insane when you can have 1.5 second case on SF

[2:39:48] iRayG2: staying close to the alter always works best for me
[2:39:51] Johnykarate: what exactly is SOD
[2:39:52] ralphh1541: @blazzedzz with procs and talents you can have 1.5 second cast SF

[2:41:00] itsbrysontv: where is the big guy?
[2:41:01] Durkyn: you can get blood from killing normal mobs too right?
[2:41:11] DeathToad007: they dont do that anymore

[2:43:42] bigwilly3737: @DeathToad007 hes level 33
[2:43:42] viqu21: hunter can summon they pet and the pet can still attack ppl without debuff
[2:43:47] wprogress: @firepoooop is that a bad thing?
[2:43:47] Fourleaf_TV: there are other schain healers across the zone you can res at to get closer to where you need to be as well...

[2:44:41] heyitsken_: exploiter rationalizations Kappa
[2:44:42] tyrone710: no more GY ganks
[2:44:47] Lawpings: guildies make numerous 5 man group and kill other people without touching the other guild members

[2:45:00] Joxtirol: i like spawn at troll camp at a middle
[2:45:08] Yeddamand: To be fair you also ran the same direction every time. I think  people will learn to spread more too
[2:45:09] Joxtirol: of stv
[2:45:09] Curtsy: being 40 doesnt change much, if a hunter manages to roll up on you you still pretty much insta die as a clothie
[2:45:11] sick0w: turn in

[2:46:24] Alfacor: wtf 524 crit as a 34
[2:46:25] matheusin_42: once again, hunter and priests are op
[2:46:26] DaProfit: have you tried the arcane 1 shot
[2:46:32] Curtsy: Basically what hunters do is die, walk up to a squishy player and unload on them when the debuff expires
[2:46:33] mickster111: Blizzard is doubling down on mage healer.
[2:46:38] yodyfoss: crush em daddy
[2:46:42] TheSerrion: Yeah go arcane oneshot
[2:46:46] mini1mage: why not use living flame with the slowing effects? Just want that 15% crit from burnout?
[2:46:49] TheSerrion: its sick
[2:46:55] heyitsken_: @xaryu living bomb is more dps but is ice lance viable for this kinda pvp?
[2:46:56] bigwilly3737: get 40 your gonna own all these noob horde

[2:48:26] myyrlidon: xarCoC xarCoC xarCoC xarCoC xarCoC xarCoC
[2:48:27] delitaa1: huge coc
[2:48:29] willy_away: Bag might be bugged put the potion on your bar

[2:49:06] artzenhooo: A FAT ASS YEP
[2:49:07] Curtsy: @lordsloths I would pay for him to not to it tbh
[2:49:08] chr47: Mages are doing more DPS in PVE than all melee, except hunters
[2:49:09] BeShiek: The new runes feel GOOD. Like I think Shockadin is viable and probably gonna be the best damage dealer for Paladin this season
[2:49:13] Shadoweth_Mango: YEP clock

[2:49:41] nitro_pain: Good for sponsor's too :)
[2:49:49] Hobblets: dueling for gold isnt gambling since its skill based

[3:16:14] ehweron: alliance players have gfs with annoying little dogs like pugs or french bulldogs
[3:16:18] Landotazo: @Xaryu it's counter intuitive but fodder immediately is better. because you are putting more power into your toon faster, therefore you can farm xp faster

[3:27:07] d3monlicous19: moonkin didn't need a nerf....
[3:27:07] subbyye: LOL
[3:27:08] banegg_: howd yuou know
[3:27:09] p3anots: Blizz already said they're balancing around pve not pvp, pve boomkin got buffed but pvp got nerfed. Good change IMO
[3:27:09] knuuuunt: @TunaLuna92 sorry you have to learn how to turn without your keyboard now

[3:27:13] samuxtv: Dont worry, spriest and melee hunters are next
[3:27:13] spear1321: everyone point and laugh at the moonkin main
[3:27:16] verrack714: whats the best class now?
[3:27:20] little508: star surge def needed a nerf but they hit it to hard
[3:27:22] Daracus98: give locks mortal coil and shadowfury

[3:27:43] sillyrogue7: i mean hes not lying lol everyone cryed about it and now its nurfd lol will be hunters soon
[3:27:44] pmanfit91: Problem with Moonkin was everyone was dying in BFD gear. Now we got nerfed before we can even see level 40 gear vs level 40 gear. Was just a damage to health ratio due to gear.
[3:27:52] samuxtv: "caster" that gets a 4s cd insta cast for 1k+ dmg = not op , YEHA OK KEKW
[3:27:57] ninetysix: drowning

[3:28:08] blazzedzz: Star sure has went back to how it was before the first buff :(
[3:28:09] woodstop22: Xaryu, what are your thoughts on shadow priest in P2 for PVE?
[3:28:09] Llynok: @Granteater4 HUH
[3:28:13] elephantinaroom: @pmanfit91 HUH
[3:28:14] bluptual: i want inbalance
[3:28:20] lshenanigansl: ss needed a nerf but the sf buff doesnt even come close to making up for it
[3:28:23] BoonesHQ: are you up for getting rid of log out skips
[3:28:25] bluptual: YES FUCK YES
[3:28:26] skipflex: lol
[3:28:27] lshenanigansl: they are total garbage in pve now
[3:28:28] DendeDewd: PERFECTLY FINE!
[3:28:29] DeathToad007: druid feels so bad to play right now man they overdid it big time
[3:28:29] Doimos89: yes
[3:28:30] R0t0kan: agreed. there is no way these people were that delusional
[3:28:32] Nicholas909: THE SECOND NERF WAS UNNECESSARY
[3:28:32] chocolate0chocolate: lmao
[3:28:33] nexxquik: Yes lmfao they needed it bad
[3:28:33] efracozz: YES
[3:28:34] NutterCircus: They felt good... KEKL
[3:28:34] OrganikCum: it needed a small nerf, not 40+%
[3:28:34] Doimos89: in PVE fine
[3:28:35] nadiko0: so fine
[3:28:35] chobinhood_: i think they just overdid it a bit
[3:28:36] sillyrogue7: lol i play one and they deff did lol
[3:28:36] rocknsake: lol 100% needed to be neutered
[3:28:37] igball: what nerf dide they get?
[3:28:37] bobbiesmals: what about every other class that 1 shots?
[3:28:37] Mochaiy: needed a nerf but it was way too much
[3:28:37] gbaraldi1: Why havent they touched spriest and melee hunter though
[3:28:37] mistamang: they needed a nerf lol
[3:28:38] little508: it need a nerf xar but they gutted it
[3:28:38] Craigumander: xarcopium
[3:28:39] DendeDewd: Hunters ran rampant AFTER NERFS all p1
[3:28:39] the_tax_collectors69: boomy is absolute garbage now though
[3:28:39] mangoshock: not as bad as hunter pets
[3:28:40] PotsNPansRobot3: don’t nerf things buff other things
[3:28:42] iRayG2: boomkins need AG1 now @xaryu
[3:28:43] Feromone: Not enough of a nerf where starsurge hits like wrath now
[3:28:45] tha_wicked: its ok for mages to solo dungeons, but god forbid moonkins have a good spell
[3:28:45] the_tax_collectors69: how do you cast starfire in pvp ?
[3:28:45] pmanfit91: Tell me today and onward that Moonkin is relevant at all. They're no longer relevant in the slightest. With one nerf.
[3:28:47] DeathToad007: it feels bad and shit to play. like wet noodle garbage
[3:28:47] TheMemphisStrangler: It was pretty cool to no longer be a completely useless class lol
[3:28:47] Ciderbeard: agree
[3:28:49] Feromone: the nerf was close to 65%
[3:28:49] Nicholas909: NOBODY'S SAYING IT SHOULDNT'VE BEEN NERFED. IT WAS NERFED TOO MUCH
[3:28:49] dylont707: no one said they didn’t need a nerf lol the nerf was over the top though
[3:28:51] hheinsoo: as a boomy i lost about 30-40% dmg
[3:28:51] jembah3: nope
[3:28:51] gazdaddy_: they were legit bugged? it wasnt overtuned, it wa a bug with their dmg coefficient being a direct 1 to 1
[3:28:52] blazzedzz: A 30% nerf tho???
[3:28:54] TransMutedMaya: they needed to nerf starsurge absolutely, but they also needed to fix the game-breaking eclipse bugs.
[3:28:56] Sh0boat: @xaryu its not the starsurge nerf - its how starsurge setup wraths and now you have to starfire which just brings back oomkin
[3:28:57] mistamang: yeah but then this will just feel like retail if everyhting is busted
[3:28:57] radmandmp: "buff other things" you dont want the game to be like that
[3:28:57] nexxquik: Mage solos dungeons, yet no one is asking for a nerf?
[3:28:59] fgaudreau05: Do melee hunter need it ?
[3:28:59] SuaSponte: an instant cast pyro on a 6 sec cd is not balanced
[3:29:00] dylont707: literally no one said don’t nerf it
[3:29:00] hirilorn_vb: If everyone is OP nobody is OP
[3:29:01] chobinhood_: it was just too much of a nerf
[3:29:02] lshenanigansl: yes but now they are garbage in pve
[3:29:02] buhtterstick: they need a PoM buff for instant starfire
[3:29:03] mrrpeanuts: @Xaryu The adjust was bs though, now you need a 3sec cast to burst, its gone
[3:29:04] Doimos89: agree to disagree
[3:29:04] drummond777: how much is starsurge hitting for now?
[3:29:05] NOHEARTs4: lol no
[3:29:05] mickster111: FUCK BRING BACK THE SCORPID PET BUFF
[3:29:05] naturalduck: lemme just run around and press 1 button as the  most mobile class in game
[3:29:06] Udenwo: moonkins crying just like hunters before them lol
[3:29:06] DeathToad007: stop trolling
[3:29:06] R0t0kan: doing 50-75% of someones health in an instant cast spell from like 43 yards., stahp
[3:29:07] OrganikCum: they aren't good
[3:29:07] bluptual: pvew
[3:29:07] Perdonamo: no way
[3:29:07] TheMemphisStrangler: COPE
[3:29:07] Nicholas909: ITS NOT
[3:29:07] Craigumander: lies
[3:29:08] The_RightTwix: Eh, not true. If moonkins can one shot people, you don't want to buff everyone to make everyone one shot people
[3:29:09] ddraggbagg: I mean I agree, but like please nerf anything hitting for over 1k dam aka priests
[3:29:09] Feromone: its not
[3:29:09] the_tax_collectors69: its not lmao
[3:29:09] tha_wicked: lmao its not a buff. mana is much worse
[3:29:10] flowermate704: its not lol
[3:29:10] Vesir_1: it isn't
[3:29:10] cxn_r: it absolutely is not a buff
[3:29:11] little508: no its not
[3:29:12] d3monlicous19: NO
[3:29:12] Doimos89: no
[3:29:13] DeathToad007: its not close to a buff
[3:29:13] Sh0boat: that moonkin you just dueled went oom in 3 seconds
[3:29:13] wreckdealer: no cause we go oom
[3:29:13] Nicholas909: stilll nerfed
[3:29:13] lshenanigansl: its a big pve nerf
[3:29:14] amexpog: nerf
[3:29:14] flowermate704: huge nerf
[3:29:14] efracozz: Moonkies needed this for all the years  they been misstreated
[3:29:16] dylont707: it’s not a buff
[3:29:17] dippymister: not at all, that's the problem
[3:29:18] Sp00kedEu: it’s not
[3:29:18] DeathToad007: they are morons
[3:29:19] gamedemon010: its huge nerf
[3:29:19] lshenanigansl: big big nerf
[3:29:20] shrektwo_ondvd: i 100% agree with your take on moonkins, and that we should buff warlocks to compensate for it.
[3:29:21] bananasaur97: which server is he playing?
[3:29:22] Haematopodidae: absolute child mentallity by these druids
[3:29:22] Oxidottin: no
[3:29:23] daijahaden: Yes it isn't no?
[3:29:24] Craigumander: bro half sp reduc and 35 raw dam nerf eesh
[3:29:24] leipis: ye only buff so every class can solo current raid!
[3:29:25] dylont707: huge nerf
[3:29:25] BuckFIake: @xaryu someone on reddit ran the math and said its 35-40 dps nerf
[3:29:25] OrganikCum: they feel terrible in the world, terrible in pvp, and in pve it was a nerf
[3:29:25] TransMutedMaya: no they didn't fix the problems they just nerfed the one spell that was overtuned
[3:29:27] christiangodwarrior97: theya re fine in pve lol
[3:29:27] amexpog: destro locks on the rise again boys
[3:29:28] dylont707: -100 dps
[3:29:30] Daracus98: so many moonkin crybabies
[3:29:31] resume___: now they're oomkins again
[3:29:31] gmzzsleeper: @Xaryu  did you get auto banded with the auto response
[3:29:33] lshenanigansl: mega pve nerf
[3:29:34] R0t0kan: Our boomkin is doing fine so not sure what they are talking about
[3:29:34] tha_wicked: moonkins get there one time to shine because they have been garbage for all of classic and ppl whine and bitch about it lmao
[3:29:35] gamedemon010: it rly got even worse now
[3:29:36] rjmtaco: @Xaryu we are meme specs again :(
[3:29:36] hallojjx: @R0t0kan its not 43 yards lol already was a nerf to that like 1 week ago
[3:29:37] DeathToad007: they ar3e bottom teir everything now
[3:29:42] Llynok: wasn't it a coefficient bug? yeah fix it, but compensate
[3:29:45] rocknsake: boomkin was OP in PVE too, nerf to the ground.  priest and melee hunter next
[3:29:49] P_h_l_o_x: why is it called nerf
[3:29:55] deebolul: I feel the answer was to decrease damage it did to players by 30 base % and it'd still be strong in pve
[3:29:56] p3anots: It's only a nerf bcz of SP coefficient. Technically the 66% dmg would be better Pv4
[3:29:57] P_h_l_o_x: asking for a froend
[3:29:57] nadiko0: they did it well by nerfing the damage it can do in pvp but with the starfire buff its still pretty good in pve
[3:29:58] R0t0kan: @hallojjx i like how you picked out the only thing., and ignored the rest
[3:29:59] JayAnders: yeah hella druids players bitching, class is still so good lmfao, was BROKEN before
[3:30:02] shalomski: Ppl say shadow op, but requires ramp up
[3:30:02] revanthyr: isnt deathroll against tos XD
[3:30:07] mumbley: i thought blizz didnt care about pvp balance and most their balancing was pve based
[3:30:07] DLXX: !followage
[3:30:07] StreamElements: @DLXX, dlxx has been following xaryu for  10 years 6 months 20 days 7 hours
[3:30:09] Austuhnnn: No its not
[3:30:10] ToreZee: what is deathroll?
[3:30:11] Ciderbeard: I do hate that only rogue and warrior can be op anything else strong gets nerfed to oblivion
[3:30:11] bluptual: because nerf gun instead of real gun @P_h_l_o_x
[3:30:12] Austuhnnn: they are horrible in PVE
[3:30:15] kindaopmusic: mele hunter is
[3:30:15] Austuhnnn: after the nerf
[3:30:16] DLXX: 10 fucking years
[3:30:16] Majinbrew: @rocknsake they did they made star fall do 66% more dmg after
[3:30:17] DeathToad007: @rocknsake bro who hurt you
[3:30:18] TierXtreme: Moonkin is SUPER pitiful now lol
[3:30:20] bryn_dee: is he trying to ignore that 6 roll lol
[3:30:22] r4men_noodle: They had their moment
[3:30:22] Feromone: bro doesnt even play this class, yet is talking bout it like he does
[3:30:25] voncline88: Moonkins are being dramatic just like hunters were with explosive shot
[3:30:29] ralphh1541: restokin is where it's at now
[3:30:32] TransMutedMaya: @JayAnders eclipse has game breaking bugs, the second half of the spell literally doesn't work at all (the pushback). so yeah it's kind of broken now. It needed a starsurge nerf alongside bug fixes
[3:30:32] pmanfit91: I just think they nerfed too early and too strong.
[3:30:32] knockouterdinmor: Xaryu, without you i would die
[3:30:33] dylont707: it is a meme spec it won’t scale now because of the coefficient spell power nerf too
[3:30:34] Mochaiy: they should of just fixed the SP scaling and then tweaked from there as needed, 60% less SP scaling and 30% flat reduction was way too much
[3:30:34] lshenanigansl: look at any moonkin logs, they dont even use starfire
[3:30:35] NOHEARTs4: they double nerfed it with the sp fix and the 30% straight nerf to dmg, it more like a 50% nerf
[3:30:36] serkline: what spec are you playing for gnomer? @xaryu
[3:30:36] R0t0kan: lets see when the logs show that most of you are just bad
[3:30:37] TierXtreme: Startwinkle is just a buff spell now lol
[3:30:38] Majinbrew: @rocknsake they compensated with that
[3:30:43] deebolul: People were running 5 boomy stv groups and just rolling everyone
[3:30:46] samuxtv: Literally no one liked boomies except boomies, yall dont deserve to just press a instant cast cd and 1 shot people quit crying
[3:30:47] Timmyjk: Starsurge doesn't 3 hit you anymore, moonkin bad
[3:30:48] Doimos89: The biggest issue is the 3.5s cast is not fun at all so you don't do it while leveling for example
[3:30:49] hallojjx: @R0t0kan the thing is it was fine just tune it down like 15% cus of instant cast but i mean SW:D from priest and lava burst hits harder before nerf anyway
[3:30:57] mohanadeva: wild
[3:30:58] R0t0kan: @hallojjx it was nowhere close to fine
[3:30:58] The_RightTwix: Why is everyone forgetting about the compensation they put in to make up for the 30% damage reduction of starsurge?
[3:31:03] BoonesHQ: mage healing is super fun
[3:31:07] blazzedzz: Yeah if you Starfire in Pve ur just OOM
[3:31:11] realandtruephobe: What class you thinking for SF HC?
[3:31:12] bigwilly3737: not this again xar your gonna rinse these guys of their gold
[3:31:20] rocknsake: yeah i'm aware, and if boomie is behind in PVE they'll prob buff more, but they won't make starsurge what it was again
[3:31:22] grimxav: gdkp detected
[3:31:24] lshenanigansl: no boomkin is saying ss wasnt op but it needed  a way bigger buff to compensate
[3:31:29] Majinbrew: @The_RightTwix i doubt they even play they just want to complain
[3:31:31] privatejosue: is this regular or classic
[3:31:32] R0t0kan: @hallojjx dont worry priests are next
[3:31:32] lshenanigansl: they trash now
[3:31:35] xQuadzilla: gdkp?
[3:31:35] PartOne21: bro. this has to be streamer rolls wtfff
[3:31:40] rocknsake: i played hunter in P1 and dealt with the constant nerfs, hunter was fine
[3:31:41] JKassari: 1G
[3:31:42] dylont707: also with nerf we actually hit less buttons now we don’t have mana for moonfire or sun fire
[3:31:45] themadfeltcher: can you do a training vid on how to win death rolls?
[3:31:48] ninetysix: blizz will think its a GDKP now
[3:31:49] TierXtreme: No one cares about starfire buff for 2 reasons...one the rune is broke and we still get PUSHBACK..2 its only a good spell casted if it crits..other than that its a noodle
[3:31:55] serkline: what would you want buffed as a mage
[3:31:59] privatejosue: is this regular wow or classic
[3:32:04] seppi_05: how much gold you have?
[3:32:05] grimxav: gdkp detected
[3:32:07] kindaopmusic: lmao
[3:32:07] taintalization: easier money than dueling
[3:32:08] r4men_noodle: no its amount times 10 for first roll
[3:32:10] xrtf1: how does deahtroll work?
[3:32:14] R0t0kan: @TierXtreme why are you getting pushback in PVE
[3:32:16] Dactylman: Streamer stealing money from regular people :(
[3:32:17] Sharpp_X: what bag add on is that?
[3:32:17] Kilamonic: BOOBA
[3:32:19] chobinhood_: just need 9 more
[3:32:19] Ciderbeard: getting vaporised by moonkin sucked but seeing something that’s not mage warrior or rogue strong was nice
[3:32:20] ChanchoZC: what bag addon is that?
[3:32:22] hallojjx: @R0t0kan the thing is eclipse is so broken atm and dont work so u cant cast for shit in pve unless u 30 yard from em
[3:32:26] Goranzo: All i heard was 420 EZ
[3:32:26] khas_plays: oh daym, what bag addon is that
[3:32:27] TunaLuna92: @TierXtreme thats all anyone is saying fix the other shit before nerfing by 35% no one said it shoiuld be nerfed

[4:16:56] ImSo1337: @TransMutedMaya Adjust lifestyle and be super healthy.  And you'll be pretty good.  couple friends had it
[4:16:57] ketchgg: lupis is an autimune disease, and it sucks

[4:20:14] braziex: @TransMutedMaya  auto-immune is usually from the family. Females are more likely, then males. There is no rhyme or reason to these diseases. A lot of them seem to appear after periods of stress and or after child birth.

[4:29:18] XL0N: it hits the priest for 50% of the dmg
[4:29:19] jackpepsimba: they need to give balance something back on the 20th when they do the other changes, thats all I care about
[4:29:20] dreadnoughht56: they already nerfed starsurge
[4:29:32] rogugor: damn lvl 34 you are flying my man

[4:52:36] Grabben33: are you making a leveling guide for this when you hit 40?

[4:57:08] marius402: I actually think the Devs want that too
[4:57:08] Rekoldt: They need to use AI to brush up textures in old zones to match a general esthetic. In retail, Classic is Classic. They don’t have the team to do a complete overhaul of graphics, and this seems like something AI assisting could help
[4:57:09] DibsieRS: we could have seperate servers  KEKW
[4:57:10] firepoooop: TBC SOM ??

[4:57:20] dblake91011: HOT TAKE HOW YALL FEEL IF THEY ADDED ARENAS TO CLASSIC
[4:57:21] TheMemphisStrangler: SoD TBC and Wotlk feels like it makes no sense lol
[4:57:22] fanniclap: Didnt blizz  say they're thinking of putting an entire new zone into the game for Sod? @Xaryu
[4:57:22] Duckduckgoose38: Where all those dead bodies are under the water that would be heckin cool
[4:57:24] meguidokun: i would love a revamp at grpahics at some point tho
[4:57:25] adumb25: they should finish the uncompleted vanilla zones first
[4:57:28] AlphaDotEpic: I'd pay for a SoD expansion that just adds new raids/content in EK/Kalimdor
[4:57:29] jbeemerks: sod. add wrath quality of life. add new content. no RMT
[4:57:30] vasconcelos_dan: But it's hard. It's part of the story. What would the new content be like? Any ideas?
[4:57:35] BitLegions: just keep all the xp boost for new players to reach levels fast to 40
[4:57:38] emosoda: they should make all the zones on Kalimdor and eastern kingdoms actually complete (tons of unfinished zones)
[4:57:38] Jullsan: wrath is massively overrated
[4:57:39] Knutzac: you cant even roll an 18 lol
[4:57:40] JesseJson: So I just took a 15 minute flight from Stonetalon Peak to Barrens....

[5:02:05] Swepian: I don't know how to counter other classes. That's why I don't like pvp
[5:02:06] DibsieRS: rbg's better
[5:02:06] weituhai: no
[5:02:06] espi: rBGs before arena
[5:02:08] oTrentx: bro is selling items in twitch chat LULW
[5:02:08] SnackshotGod: ruins game
[5:02:09] bubble07: It would be disaster
[5:02:10] Kataemoi: Arena is what keeps me playing wow, so yes it would be a good idea
[5:02:12] Drevs09: MMR solo que BG's
[5:02:12] fanniclap: no arena
[5:02:12] ehweron: frick arenas, we want rbgs
[5:02:16] KhalBones: D:

[5:02:27] Dingid: what about 1v1 arenas?
[5:02:27] stekarkent: not even 1v1 arena?
[5:02:27] Majinbrew: they would have to hyper balance too much

[5:02:28] hawks15233: I went to sleep 5 hours ago and still 34? really are going for world last 40
[5:02:29] creaturesfan72: arenas force homogenization of pvp
[5:02:30] jazzyjoff: STV event is more fun now
[5:02:34] kurtynger: true world pvp should be as SOD
[5:02:34] lossietv: i think a brawler's guild type arena would be fun maybe 1v1s in a brawler's guild type arena in SoD @Xaryu  THOUGHTS?????? I THINK IM ON TO SOMETHING
[5:02:35] Rhetaz: I like the SOD RP pvp style only in BG's and during events. Do not have to worry about getting ganked when leveling.
[5:02:36] kekailani_: wpvp only has so much to gain tho
[5:02:36] BoonesHQ: world pvp > arenas

[5:02:42] Elijahss: Why rated when regualar BGs work just fine?
[5:02:43] lossietv: i think a brawler's guild type arena would be fun maybe 1v1s 2v2s in a brawler's guild type arena in SoD @Xaryu  THOUGHTS?????? I THINK IM ON TO SOMETHING

[5:02:51] JayNaggy: how come your release spirit looks different? it that just classic over wotlk?

[5:03:05] clee0724: W
[5:03:05] Gankz: @Xaryu why not both?
[5:03:06] xQuadzilla: M
[5:03:10] lossietv: i think a brawler's guild type arena would be fun maybe 1v1s 2v2s  in a brawler's guild type arena you have to go to it and watch in SoD @Xaryu  THOUGHTS?????? I THINK IM ON TO SOMETHING
[5:03:10] apvii: LLL
[5:03:16] hunchurio: l
[5:03:16] Rhetaz: I chose the non pvp rp server. Has pvp but can level without getting ganked.
[5:03:18] fanniclap: Most people don't even like watching arena cause they don't understand it let alone play them
[5:03:27] TheSlawterhouse: Except wrath cata retail pvp is bad
[5:03:27] ictoa88: maybe eventually we get enough blood zone type events we can rotate
[5:03:27] drummond777: but thats not sod
[5:03:30] TheSlawterhouse: Bring arenas to classic
[5:03:30] cadetk9: @Xaryu i ran into the boomy somewhere else in deso he isnt nearby anymore
[5:03:31] xhappyxhappyx: It doesnt need to be the only game mode for pvpers, just an additional one. I could understand why you would think it could kill the world though.
[5:03:34] sound_wayv: why have arena in the most unbalanced iteration of wow lol, would be a shitshow
[5:03:37] AlphaDotEpic: What if they added an Arena event? Like mini blood moon / gurabashi arena type thing? So still world PvP, fight over a prize vs. another player locked in 1v1, winner gets the chest.
[5:03:40] meguidokun: lol but that not valid at all, we playing season of discovery, which brings all expas is
[5:03:41] xrtf1: how do u make to see % health on enemy
[5:03:43] meguidokun: that bs actually
[5:03:45] Banzeye95: that's because you know you won't be able to resist, and your life will become classic arenas @Xaryu
[5:03:45] casperthefrndlyforgeafker: is frost mage BIS?
[5:03:48] jamkiri: I liked all forms of pvp when I played it was awesome.
[5:03:48] doubled09: @sound_wayv Ya, exactly
[5:03:50] daijahaden: Be cool if they expanded on the blood moon concept. Like the two groups with the highest blood gets invited into Gurubashi Arena at the end for a fight to the death.
[5:03:51] sickmonkey1991: DO THIS IRL PotFriend
[5:04:02] fanniclap: @meguidokun lmfao?
[5:04:06] Arlhachedhel: Did a gnomer this morning before reset, epic dagger drops  I roll an 11, winner rolled 13
[5:04:06] Deomas11: A diff form of arena in SoD would be cool. More accessible and casual friendly like SoD is
[5:04:06] tuna_sandw1ch: @Xaryu I didnt know we shared the same bday
[5:04:06] KhalBones: @Xaryu Experiance the world??? 80% of chat is dungeon spamming to 40
[5:04:07] SlLVER_FOX: I'd rather play arena than unfair Wpvp tho'. Sucks getting trained by a raid out in the world
[5:04:10] lossietv: i think a brawler's guild type arena would be fun maybe 1v1s 2v2s  in a brawler's guild type arena you have to go to it and watch in SoD @Xaryu  THOUGHTS?????? I THINK IM ON TO SOMETHING
[5:04:12] BitLegions: yes
[5:04:15] thebigzang: @daijahaden the company isnt cool enough to think that well

[5:04:25] Shajaa: @Xaryu Yo help a warrior out and let me get in that next bloodmoon group. its rough out here.
[5:04:25] dae_bed: the randomness of meeting someone out in the world makes every interaction unique
[5:04:28] TheSlawterhouse: Experience the world? weve donee that 10x
[5:04:33] CatformTV: will you play HC SF on the 29th? @Xaryu
[5:04:35] mistamang: lol questing is impossible

[5:04:40] Zolshy89: @TheSlawterhouse Based
[5:04:41] official_tiago: I always speed lvl to 40 and then quest to get golds :p
[5:04:44] DeathToad007: dungeon grinding is so much faster
[5:04:44] 1cxlo: You have to dungeon spam or you just get ganked and cant level at all
[5:04:46] daijahaden: @thebigzang the sadge truth
[5:04:50] xhappyxhappyx: What if they did arena events where its only available for a certain period of time?
[5:04:50] Deomas11: A diff type of arena in SoD would be cool. More accessible and casual friendly like the rest of SoD is. Maybe it's just for fun rewards like gear, mounts and it awards PvP marks of honor etc....
[5:04:52] weituhai: spam run SM > questing
[5:04:54] BitLegions: i done the runes today its easy with a group
[5:04:57] Saiauriel: I just pay someone to get on my account and get the runes for me
[5:05:01] retox248: the spam for lvling is fine people overreact om that
[5:05:02] Faymatic: sup guys
[5:05:06] mjs010: Open world leveling is really miserable right now.
[5:05:07] retox248: on
[5:05:13] iOrigami1: it sucks lol
[5:05:17] Elijahss: the only arena should be for duals
[5:05:20] lossietv: @Xaryu hear me out, brawler's guild-type 1v1 2v2 arena where you have to actuallygo to the location (somewhere in eastern or kalimdor) and watch and fight THOUIGHTS?
[5:05:20] pizac7: so many of them aren't worth it
[5:05:23] aftershockzzzz: sell for 20 silver lol
[5:05:25] meguidokun: its been 5 days, the grind is just fine, gnomeran got cleared it 24 hours
[5:05:26] iOrigami1: super expensive earl;y level
[5:05:26] jalgorithm: its so pointless
[5:05:27] fanniclap: @mjs010 depends where. I refuse to go to arathi right now rofl
[5:05:29] doubled09: LOL
[5:05:29] jalgorithm: its terrible
[5:05:31] Ddocz: 1v1 arena would be insanely cool
[5:05:39] Faymatic: How is Phase 2? since work is a lot ATM i wasnt able to check it out
[5:05:42] jalgorithm: no one uses them its pointless

[5:05:54] kiirkey: where do you turn in box?
[5:05:55] lossietv: @fishinfogg it would be sick right

[5:05:59] BIuffwatcher: lol
[5:05:59] marius402: How much is riding at 40, anyone knows?
[5:06:00] kirosofiqneca: Do you think they should make SM raid next phase? I think it's a massive missed opportunity for that phase, Gnomeregan sucks imo
[5:06:03] samo178: XD
[5:06:03] CousinAvi86: gives 1.5g to 2.5g, can pay for filling it too

[5:06:18] marius402: sweet thx
[5:06:18] alleviationtv: they’ve been worth the gold to fill imo- there’s a few random ones that aren’t but if they’re 5-10g it’s worth
[5:06:19] ironmouse34: it's 50g
[5:06:24] KhalBones: bloodmoon only works in stv??
[5:06:24] nitro_pain: I got 3k at 31 with rested

[5:14:49] swirled: Frostbite can trigger off of your ice armor, it screws up AOE pulling
[5:14:50] kaserv1: i tried copying the route you did thru STV from 32-34 but only got 1 level and murdered repeatedly from alli during bloodmoon Sadpepe
[5:14:50] scoutbeans: any reason you're using burnout instead of fingers of frost? esp since you have shatter. it'll make your living bombs crit so much more.
[5:14:51] derpyllama420: Madge
[5:14:54] mukulukku: @BLUNDERGUN true, raids have never been the issue imo, but there were huge content droughts and progression didn't feel too good. ashran was also a mess
[5:15:00] TcrTV_: runes dont scale with SP, that's why
[5:15:02] Sterfx: @Xaryu not to judge i know you do it for your watchers but why lvl like this instead of like 1stream of SM and your 40 into the fun content?
[5:15:04] mojobro92: !time
[5:15:13] derpyllama420: I was so bummed that ICe Lance was so weak
[5:15:16] TcrTV_: If your rune spells scaled with SP, it would be good.

[5:15:38] lastad94: is balance druid still ok in pvp?
[5:15:53] MrStLouis68: ice lance was great pre level 6
[5:15:58] derpyllama420: I tho with fingers of frost at least it would be strong
[5:15:58] zebercetanayurt: chat,  is there an addon to check ah and tell me how much it costs to level profession
[5:15:59] frange3: how good is frostfire?
[5:16:05] BitLegions: mage is op
[5:16:09] tawkey: Yo Xar, do you ever miss the competitive retail scene?
[5:16:11] ehweron: @Sterfx no one is 40 yet. Xaryu is literally highes lvl mage currently thanks to his speed levelling strat
[5:16:12] hot_souffle: frost is just meh
[5:16:14] crazychris2108: is boomie good in pvp @Xaryu
[5:16:16] thericebags: so imba
[5:16:19] Rhetaz: I like that you are not rushing to 40 doing that is not enjoying the game.
[5:16:24] Darksyde1029: How hard does ice lance crit?
[5:16:24] thismandalorian: arcane is nuts with msisile barrage right now
[5:16:27] Coachperkins: i think frost is the best pvp spec rn
[5:16:28] Nicholas909: DOUBLE NERFED*
[5:16:30] iamabirdttv: spriests
[5:16:32] daijahaden: Kodo roundup, hands down in the top 5 worst quests of classic. Hate it.
[5:16:34] espi: they're awful lol
[5:16:35] zeraf09: ice lance hits hard at 40, ziqo was playing it and hitting for 400-500 on frozen targets
[5:16:37] That_pillar: fingers of frost need to guarantee crit and that will fix it... also like 1005 increased dmg
[5:16:39] KosmicDevil_: fire mage is doing crazy dps rn in pve
[5:16:41] Soranoshi: its not good anymore lol
[5:16:42] derpyllama420: pvp is still 75% skills anyway
[5:16:43] tylerran34: I just ran a atrathi and with a dedicated healer i dropped 36 Kbs
[5:16:47] kaserv1: i think fire is still going to be the  best this phase no?
[5:16:47] tylerran34: the class still mumps
[5:16:47] MrStLouis68: @mandaloran_03 you building full arcane? or arcane fire
[5:16:48] Craigumander: Poor boomy.. it was good for a day
[5:16:50] thiceofficial: @Xaryu have you leveled warrior
[5:16:54] moltencrucible: @derpyllama420 LUL
[5:17:00] BitLegions: there something mage does in aracane that just wipes people
[5:17:03] dragonxzz: how miserable is farming missle barage guys ? how long does it take
[5:17:04] lastad94: what classes are good in pvp rn
[5:17:04] thismandalorian: @mrstlouis68 full arcane right now

[5:17:16] StreamElements: Xaryu's setup -> https://www.amazon.com/shop/xaryulol
[5:17:20] derpyllama420: @derpyllama420 a good bad class will win against a bad meta class
[5:17:22] BitLegions: 2450 crits on mage
[5:17:29] themadfeltcher: maelstrom might be worse farm
[5:17:32] Darksyde1029: @jwboss_ Yea anything more than that would be stupid, but 500 sounds quite strong already tbh.
[5:17:33] Rhetaz: Mage using only melee staff is totally meta right now
[5:17:33] PioIter: takes 30 min ish
[5:17:39] thiceofficial: discombobulated
[5:17:40] thismandalorian: if you do it same time as books for spell crit rune you get two in one done
[5:17:40] FelAfflicted: FelAfflicted subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 32 month streak! Haven’t been able to catch you as much lately :( hope you and the family are well.
[5:17:46] Kriehp: missile barrage is so good with arcane blast
[5:17:46] PioIter: you should do it while leveling, you get xp from turn ins
[5:17:49] thismandalorian: cause the dark riders same areas as books
[5:17:52] frange3: there is also a new rune, the one with arcane and frost damge thing, is it good?
[5:17:52] Craigumander: @Xaryu my moonfire crits are like 100 more dam than starsurge normals
[5:18:00] holymorph26: the next phase of SOD will be to level 50??
[5:18:03] dragonxzz: @PioIter 30 min for what ?
[5:18:05] jwboss_: Yeah into nova...
[5:18:12] PioIter: @dragonxzz missile barrage
[5:18:15] griffinwish: AB+ barrage for pvp or pve chat?
[5:18:17] jbmangos: well setup shatter combos should chunk someone
[5:18:18] ehweron: @holymorph26 yes
[5:18:22] st0rmsong: Need to click on kodo
[5:18:23] CatformTV: click  the kodo
[5:18:24] Darksyde1029: @Xaryu Or with FoF? Instant casts shouldn't be critting more than 500ish under any circumstance imo. Hard casting should be required to do big juicy damage.
[5:18:27] Kriehp: @frange3 spellfrost bolt is only really good if you wanna kill mobs way above your level
[5:18:28] CrazenFPS: man that kodo back looks like my back sitting 15 hours a day
[5:18:31] frankonako: wheres your mount
[5:18:35] daijahaden: Whoever designed this quest needs to be taken out back and starsurged.
[5:18:46] dragonxzz: @PioIter dont you need to kill some elite in alot of different zones to get it
[5:18:49] kaserv1: just bullied that lil critter sadpepe
[5:18:50] tetsuaka4: Any idea on mage duel meta spec chat?
[5:18:55] tylerran34: tylerran34 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[5:19:03] tetsuaka4: I want arc to be good
[5:19:03] woche0392: I just saw a 29 rogue on a mount, but it only gave 50%
[5:19:04] Xenocide321: don't need to be 40
[5:19:04] frankonako: kind of boring without a mount
[5:19:07] PioIter: @dragonxzz thats correct, you can do it in a raid however
[5:19:12] rubbmytotem: xaryu where is ur fav spot to aoe level with a mage at 22!!
[5:19:12] Nicholas909: no wonder this is for boomies if you gotta be 40 for a mount
[5:19:14] Xenocide321: 29 orc hunter on a mount rn
[5:19:27] Vevovic: stv 20 minutes
[5:19:30] xureals: xureals subscribed with Prime. 
[5:19:30] CrazenFPS: @frankonako no, having a mount is animal abuse
[5:19:31] glacsooon: what class got the highest DPS right now so far in phase 2?
[5:19:31] Corwynn_2: oh the ashenvale mount is only in ashenvale? wild
[5:19:43] themadfeltcher: just reroll shaman, get 2/3 mount at level 20, free, and 1s cast
[5:19:44] mukulukku: enchancement shaman in SoD might be the most fun it's ever been
[5:19:46] morat_g: Do we know if the ashenvale and stvs mounts will be usable everywhere when you train riding?
[5:19:50] BitLegions: you right , i watch the mage build again he wipes all his mana but instantly kills anyone 1v1
[5:19:56] lastad94: is feral any good in pvp chat?
[5:19:58] kr3mpanen: why are u saying ice lance is not hiting hard? i crit 350-500 with a global cooldown thats alot
[5:20:04] tuna_sandw1ch: @morat_g ya a little bit
[5:20:05] sodaxdpapi: xar come to stv so i can farm u
[5:20:07] drummond777: COPIUM
[5:20:17] Varels1: FOR GNOMEREGAN
[5:20:21] MagicalPurs3: Perfect i'll take my quiz for one of my Master's courses and start paying back attention just in time for STV
[5:20:30] dragonxzz: @kr3mpanen hes saying that its inferior to other options which it is
[5:20:38] samuxtv: Xar can you teach me how to cone of cold at an angle? i keep whiffing.
[5:20:43] Rekantheman: Finger of frost
[5:20:47] tuna_sandw1ch: @MagicalPurs3 everyone has a masters nowadays
[5:20:49] Oopogo1: hot streak pyro crits for 1500 + ignite
[5:20:50] themadfeltcher: FoF?
[5:20:50] Mostarry: Fof
[5:20:52] Fressett: Ele sham any good in SoD?
[5:21:01] kaserv1: thats a basic crit for fire even at 32
[5:21:05] TransMutedMaya: fishing for fingers is my favorite passtime
[5:21:07] thegeneralmort: Don't you get it off ice armor too though
[5:21:09] mojobro92: Combined attack damage
[5:21:12] gunzpewpew: @Fressett YEs
[5:21:15] Coachperkins: you gotta try it frost is low key good
[5:21:17] dragonxzz: meanwhile you press living bomb and get much more value in most situations
[5:21:20] kr3mpanen: its procs pretty oftem actually, if u spam r1 bolts
[5:21:22] CritsAndTaxes: any chill effect right? yeah vs melee they'll feed you procs. good point
[5:21:28] lastad94: should i invest in my feral or just play rogue for pvp ?
[5:21:29] Craigumander: Starsurge is 200 now
[5:21:35] Nicholas909: starsurge does 200-250 now
[5:21:42] dragonxzz: @kr3mpanen but its not worth at all tho
[5:21:43] TransMutedMaya: my starsurge is doing less dmg than wrath
[5:21:45] TheRiddleMan: @Xaryu why no talent points in improve frost dmg?
[5:21:48] Craigumander: And all boomy utility compared is much less
[5:21:49] Oopogo1: 500 crit is 250 when mobs have 2x health
[5:21:51] Oopogo1: ain't much
[5:22:04] themadfeltcher: It's easy, you just need to cast "change class"
[5:22:07] EternalFun2023: full caster mode
[5:22:12] Darksyde1029: That just means those classes need to be tuned down. If ice lance hit harder than 500 it would be absolutely broken
[5:22:18] GrazzloTV: those homonculi are so cute
[5:22:20] pmanfit91: It's week 1 and people cried nerf. Nobody should have cried for a nerf before people could actually see what everyone was capable of.
[5:22:22] griffinwish: you'd be a good wow commentator
[5:22:25] MagicalPurs3: The thought of a homunculus is gross.
[5:22:34] Oopogo1: Kappa
[5:22:42] cadetk9: KEKW
[5:22:44] plae007: surge hitting 600 crits on the high end
[5:22:59] quickkbeam: rewind time is ass
[5:23:00] smoore48: nah, the fact it only hits 500 with a proc or freeze is not out of line with any other classes
[5:23:00] gunzpewpew: LB is overrated
[5:23:03] BitLegions: arcane blast then might as well arcane lol
[5:23:09] sharky_exp: yup
[5:23:11] CassieLayne: I really wish they made ice lance better. It's so useless
[5:23:23] sneaksaway: arcane blast gives you nothing haha
[5:23:23] petedelete2019: yeah why is it even in the game if it never makes sense to pick? @Xaryu
[5:23:28] BitLegions: yeah makes sense frost mage using frost spells
[5:23:29] ironb0rn: what is EU time for stv event chat?
[5:23:31] Kriehp: yeah feels bad to do any dungeon in frost talents
[5:23:33] lilgothelf: every class at 40 has a spec that can one shot, some are easier to pull off which is the problem
[5:23:40] tha_wicked: the problem is the devs have bitten off way more than they can chew. they have so much to balance and so many abilities and runes across classes, its clear they are incapable of balancing it all
[5:23:41] hashtagstronger: @ironb0rn in 1h 15 min
[5:23:42] Kriehp: can only really do slowbot with imp blizz
[5:23:43] itsterryhesticals: @petedelete2019 rofl why are half the spells that dont get used in the game?
[5:23:44] Oopogo1: frost needs a buff it's been dog for 2 phases now
[5:23:46] PioIter: give us alter time and db blizzard

[5:26:23] BitLegions: fingers of frost , living flame , living bomb , frostfire bolt and brain freeze is the bis
[5:26:24] lasmino: i feel like the damage is fine but it doesnt frost enough
[5:26:25] radassbadass69: you're meant to run spell power run with it on boots if you arent already

[6:42:22] beastvader: What about the dragon underground the 3 headed one
[6:42:35] broms123: elden ring/bg3 are two of the best cames ive ever played
[6:42:39] kaizen421: the dragon placidusax?
[6:42:45] Nimbus723: placidusax
[6:42:46] kebablangaren: the time dragon?
[6:42:58] gunzpewpew: BG3 is literally 11/10
[6:43:05] plae007: lol i just crit 260 w/ starsurge @Xaryu
[6:43:09] winterstarsx: thats what she said
[6:43:14] gunzpewpew: I think BG3 is an offstream game honestly
[6:43:14] kaizen421: BG3 / ER are both in a league of their own
[6:43:14] oprawindfurytv: sup xar, i just farm 10 silver in two bloodmoons.... had Trill with me on his ele sham
[6:43:18] TransMutedMaya: yeah i feel like we are at peak gaming right now, elden ring and bg3 are amazing, and others are good too
[6:43:23] Kanooog: I wish they had a way to play Elden Ring Pre Patches when it was harder.
[6:43:25] b_argy: anyone else prefer sekiro to elden ring?
[6:43:27] bogczarjon: how did no one like it
[6:43:27] roxaz_chachvm: @Xaryu hey man u 40 yet?

[6:43:45] kaizen421: wym?? ER was great content
[6:43:49] JesseJson: not for me
[6:43:57] Webbyster_: turn based is just a lot slower of a game
[6:44:09] kaizen421: Esfand was one of the few streamers who did BG3 well
[6:44:11] beastvader: BG dark alliance was good
[6:44:11] RoomToDream: never played one on stream or at all?
[6:44:12] Doimos89: BG3 sucks to play on stream? I think it's one of the best games to play on stream
[6:44:17] moltencrucible: who's logan?
[6:44:17] Ramathorn937: BG3 could be fun if you let viewers decide your actions lol

[6:44:43] hayvex: How on earth did you get that heal off lol
[6:44:46] asloff: i dont know what you're talking about the "SQWUAAKKSS" you did when the dragons roared were 10/10 content
[6:44:47] raininglead1: 3 40's pikcing on lowbies typical
[6:44:50] Varels1: BG3 is amazing imo. took some time to get used to but the slow phase is really comfy
[6:44:50] asloff: in ER*
[6:44:51] Ssds: I tried friend

[6:46:17] pandemanium_tv: It's ok xaryu my eyes were dripping scarlet blood by the time I got done in SM I understand
[6:46:35] revananator: i bought dragonlands, leveled 1 character to max and went back to classic. definitely not buying the next one
[6:46:36] TransMutedMaya: let's be real, arena junkies are never truly done with arena, we just take breaks
[6:46:38] zen_oni_shinobi: trauma bond
[6:46:40] papaotter: Been there
[6:46:40] Deomas11: Just complete campaign and don't arena
[6:46:42] Alfacor: I want to see it man

[6:47:42] kaizen421: damn xar is addicted to arena the way he said that was scary
[6:47:43] RiptoreCA: yeah, you do have an amazing commentator voice
[6:47:46] gromp_vendor: @Xaryu Can we level faster? you level 1 level a day, I understand that you touch grass and all but come on man, you should be 40 now
[6:47:49] papaotter: Kai will help with it. You won't have as much time, but also those kinds of things have less hold on you. Not sure how to describe it, dadhood just puts things in a new perspective
[6:48:10] Philopinos: do u ever pvp in real life ?
[6:48:13] Puppette: dopamine
[6:48:15] 1cyveins: League? KEKW
[6:48:17] piz2: @Xaryu yo yo can you show talents ?:))
[6:48:18] macjcool: you like to merc zoomers
[6:48:19] Wyant69: Sathele is camping behind pillar for you xaryu
[6:48:22] REDFOFO: i remember the time you used to play new world
[6:48:26] Kanooog: I said I was going to casually play DF and ended up getting addicted. I'm finally on a break
[6:48:33] beastvader: Your competitive xar that’s good
[6:48:34] j_smith50: anyway you can explain your movement/keybinds... im new to this type of game and its a bit confusing. if your finger needs to be down on W to move forward how are you supposed to hit 2,3,4 for abilities at same time?
[6:48:35] 2oublewidesuprise: Posture Check!
[6:48:35] alleviationtv: outplaying people gives a certain type of adrenaline that’s hard to find
[6:48:35] moltencrucible: will we ever see pika-xar playing together again?
[6:48:36] HawaiianSpaceLasers: zero sum
[6:48:41] Guidry: gettin too old to be stressin about games
[6:48:44] Guidry: i feel it too
[6:48:55] bluptual: been years since i let that go im 33
[6:48:57] chr47: it is zero sum, can't be all winners in pvp
[6:49:00] jamonspk: do you feel as if maybe your circle promotes it too much?
[6:49:10] kaizen421: wise self reflection SeemsGood
[6:49:13] zlovett08: love when you played arenas
[6:49:16] taylorsdank: if yall hammered pika to play anything but retail as much as you hammered xar theyd probably game together
[6:49:19] zlovett08: shit was the best game play
[6:49:21] jamonspk: or maybe your perception on it may be pre conceived prior to ur independent growth?
[6:49:24] savagekelr: @xaryu do you ever feel like you are limited in what content you can stream based on how much viewership you get? like you want to play other games but you just don’t get enough viewers if it’s not mainstream wow
[6:49:34] zen_oni_shinobi: toxicity is toxicity.  it follows no matter where someone goes. to the point where the average person wants to flick the toxicity in the eyeball.
[6:49:36] twitterlesstyler: @xaryu  Would you be open to the idea of SoD adding a class like DK into the classic environment in further phases?
[6:49:36] macjcool: imagine if you were 40
[6:49:38] rileyjay: the relatability i have to you on this is insane granted different titles. i cannot fathom playing certain games "for fun" anymore with how much my actual life demands. its hard to want to not degen something you've degen'd for years on end
[6:49:39] zlovett08: 1v2'in rank 1s or glads all the time
[6:49:43] jamonspk: i respect your decision always just want ur opinion
[6:49:47] sunny_gee: whats your fav gladiator title
[6:49:54] Zonex2004: Are pvpers smarter than pvmers?
[6:50:02] j_smith50: anyway you can explain your movement/keybinds... im new to this type of game and its a bit confusing. if your finger needs to be down on W to move forward how are you supposed to hit 2,3,4 for abilities at same time?
[6:50:09] radassbadass69: @Xaryu has your questing experience been tolerable?
[6:50:13] Rollerxd: Thoughts on "Spy" addon?
[6:50:17] TransMutedMaya: regen, don't degen
[6:50:20] bluptual: im degening sod
[6:50:21] NickAle006: workout done with you in my ear for an hour. thanks dude
[6:50:22] Tirveal: i feel the exact same way about games in generla
[6:50:28] UntouchedExodus: so whats the go to spec for mage now?
[6:50:32] adumb25: i was degening sodcore
[6:50:34] taylorsdank: @NickAle006 W i do same

[6:51:15] ieatzpie055: Damn, tried to post the video... xaryu's point of no return with wow arena was definitely the 1v2 Jah & abn.

[6:51:30] taylorsdank: @Zonex2004 that same logic you're degening everytime you clock in at subway
[6:51:31] PMA_1: bro they are gonna buff you!
[6:51:44] zen_oni_shinobi: @rileyjay it's almost as if the mindset that comes with the struggle to get into a game, like earning the cash for the purchase, or fighting for the hours off to get game time will flow over into the persons actual style that determines their mindset while they play.
[6:51:58] provender_: Boys where is that 2H from??
[6:52:07] JihnFei: jesus stvietnam. all these guys come out of the jungle from nowhere
[6:52:10] zen_oni_shinobi: @rileyjay just my 2c.

[6:53:19] enigmasvea: cus ICC been out for 5 months and sod is released KEKW
[6:53:24] pandemanium_tv: my guild is still hard stuck on Heroic Lich King I'm so sick of it
[6:53:25] liteseekerqt: I still very much enjoy it
[6:53:31] thecptcotton: I play ICC classic. come check it out
[6:53:36] Deomas11: The community has ruined WotLK to the point a new player or even a catch-up player can't get into a dungeon or any content
[6:53:46] NickAle006: @kaizen421 I just came back for first time since like 2016. I think it’d be cool to try, I’m sure it had its hype then died out
[6:53:48] enigmasvea: same why nobody plays retail, everyone waiting for next patch + sod released
[6:53:51] FinaticYum: did that shaman have a totem weapon?
[6:53:56] anelko90: ye but this is mmo forever game though xd
[6:53:57] giantbeast1: @Xaryu have u thought about playing boldersgate2?
[6:53:59] jaliela01: lich king classic is not dead just because the streamers arent playing it Lmao
[6:54:05] d3monlicous19: thats how palworld is
[6:54:09] zen_oni_shinobi: @xaryu agreed look at wciii reforged.  complete flop. same thing applies.  not a play forever game, just means that people are content with their experience.
[6:54:11] TransMutedMaya: "xar says elden ring is a trash game" headline tomorrow
[6:54:14] liteseekerqt: @Xaryu have you ever sold r1 carries
[6:54:17] asloff: HC eldenring when?
[6:54:18] FurylordD: what level are you xar?
[6:54:21] tesch384: bg3 was ass
[6:54:25] raininglead1: wrath is one of those expansions that ppl thought was better than they remember and when they got to play it again they saw.
[6:54:26] Zonex2004: I don't think you give "playthrough" games enough attention. Just enough to appease some fanbase
[6:54:33] taylorsdank: @asloff praying when the DLC comes out he does this
[6:54:37] NickAle006: @jaliela01 I logged in and checked it out and seemed dead to me
[6:54:39] kaizen421: BG2 has an AMAZING story but its incredibly dated at this point.
[6:54:40] omglookbrandon: mop days

[6:55:43] Varels1: @qteelmao It's a setting
[6:55:44] vilemerch: will you ever hit 40 ?
[6:55:45] Sterfx: i always loved classic gamestyle. but the wotlk talents/abillity's that into SoD is just the perfect match for me. hope it doesnt die off.
[6:55:49] moltencrucible: @enigmasvea feels like sodp2 doesn't really have that much players tho, people playing but feels definitely less than p1
[6:55:51] Badbotqt: please level to 40 to shit on these kids ever more
[6:55:54] FurylordD: chat, getting to level 40 in the first or second week is not worth the time consumption because there is only 1 lockout each week for two weeks
[6:55:55] 77courtjester77: Are you going to play Enshrouded again?
[6:56:01] eynesil: when will you hit 40?

[6:56:40] kaizen421: would love to see xar try Sekiro its the hardest game i have played by far
[6:56:45] enigmasvea: @moltencrucible feel no difference from p1, they did make more layers tho

[6:57:57] d3monlicous19: why are you not surprised about soda???
[6:57:59] PMA_1: soda is prob already level 40
[6:58:01] eynesil: @xaryu What are your thoughts about using creatine?
[6:58:05] twitterlesstyler: @xaryu I need you to explain this to me like I'm a small child. Why is Pluto, a dog, owned by Mickey? Goofy, who also is a dog, is one of Mickey's closest pals and is able to freely walk and talk in the world yet Pluto is stuck being owned by another being, forced to live in a house outside.
[6:58:07] Swurr: when are you supposed to use frostfire bolt?
[6:58:07] imvecks: Also esfand is just not playing it or what ? he was so hyped for it
[6:58:07] nikotrengen: Why did soda stop?

[6:58:14] enigmasvea: @Xaryu would you recommend creatine?
[6:58:16] vSluis: i mean if its anything like P1, we'll have a ton of time to "try it"
[6:58:18] shloom995: @Tangents92  just a question is it wrong? my bad

[6:58:53] Varels1: @kaizen421 yup
[6:58:54] soloBubatz: doesnt creatine do hair loss
[6:58:55] xDeSoh: @Xaryu do you think they should make a "heroic" version of BFD for endgame raiding at 40, 60, etc
[6:58:58] kaizen421: hes very good at it though all power to him
[6:58:58] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu Didnt you take creatine before? what made you stop?
[6:59:02] shloom995: @Tangents92  forgive me sir im just a fan of him
[6:59:02] TransMutedMaya: i wish asmon wouldn't do culture war stuff, I'm so tired of people cryin about woke

[6:59:28] zonewwolfen: i like that
[6:59:29] omglookbrandon: need a xar and bajheera workout stream
[6:59:30] zen_oni_shinobi: kreatine wasn't for me.  in my early 20s my calves looked wavy and my thighs were bulk to the point that my legiments were weak.
[6:59:30] espi: a heroic 5-man maybe
[6:59:30] yami_yugi_87: Asmon thinks he is the god damn Dr. Phil for gamers. So annoying
[6:59:32] GetSpiked: Great idea
[6:59:33] vampirebees: i aint tryin to back in bfd fuck that
[6:59:33] TrueNosus: @TransMutedMaya yeah shits fr so annoying

[6:59:41] lossietv: think thats a great idea, maybe an additional heroic mechanic or something?
[6:59:42] shloom995: @Tangents92  ok not gonna happen again
[6:59:49] anelko90: just buy 100 tablets of turanabol and drink 1 to 2 per day ,,P
[6:59:51] zen_oni_shinobi: i took regular flintstone vitamins, fish oil, and cinnamon.
[6:59:53] serverfirst300003: @dreamofhonk lol did he gank you PJSalt

[7:00:06] Klups: Whats your top pick for lvl 50 raid? @Xaryu mine is BRD
[7:00:06] raininglead1: we're gonna end up in mid/end game Burning crusade numbers in sod

[7:00:28] jonnicle: ST
[7:00:31] GetSpiked: Wasn't Sunken Temple initially a 10man raid actually?
[7:00:31] pandemanium_tv: BRD + MC should be 60 raid
[7:00:31] angiefrack: @Xaryu how did you get the elite portrait?
[7:00:34] Deomas11: I think a new BRM dungeon entirely would be great
[7:00:40] raininglead1: ppl always do brd anyway tits needs to be adung nobody really does
[7:00:41] omglookbrandon: we need a Xaryu and Bajheera workout stream
[7:00:53] bladeauch1: do you suppose they will tune the endgame raids to be more difficult, beings that we have ruins that circumvent some of the vanilla challenges/
[7:00:56] Tangents92: And Soni @omglookbrandon
[7:00:56] asloff: imagine the loot pool that could come out of brd though,,, do you really want to give that up?
