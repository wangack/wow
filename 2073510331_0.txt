[1:40:07] lolxuss: lets go
[1:40:26] Joneim: @Sepiyat Yes, because that is trash from earlier in the dungeon

[1:40:49] MisterNioce: everyone beat Eclipse
[1:40:52] Denekyy: like i still dont get it how do you even get the trash in ? the door boss is closed no ?
[1:40:53] lewhitehd69: is everyone using echo's summon tech on rize or is there a faster way?
[1:40:53] Sepiyat: @Joneim Ah, so the issue was more "Pulling stuff from further" rather than just the wall?
[1:40:54] Lonely_TTV: Eclipse was the team that showed the summon in Rise
[1:41:17] Joneim: @Sepiyat Yeah, thats what Blizzards rules say iirc.
[1:41:18] yunodx: is all of MDI +22 or it changes?
[1:41:36] LuciFeariUm: @Sepiyat Eh, its likely that they pulled stuff a) from further ahead in the dungeon and b) with a pet through a wall
[1:41:42] zynessa: @yunodx depends on the dung
[1:41:45] Swinkyy7: @yunodx between +22 and +24
[1:41:48] Joneim: @Sepiyat Specifically, you cant pull further than your current progression point

[1:44:44] MrChaCho: @Maximum I rewatched the tech, the aug definitely messed up the parkour at least 2 times. I tried it and it's super hard for evoker.

[1:45:18] ddepan: their tier is weird for dungeons
[1:45:22] guynormally: need big hp mobs, shit dies before you get to use all of your damage
[1:45:22] antipheonixna: i thought dev was pretty beans this patch
[1:45:22] vel_ttv: it’s awful profile. 2 minute reliant and backloaded

[1:45:50] Erktraz: the bug catcher mog is legendary
[1:46:02] Deatheran: They are reliant on reaaallly long pulls for the tier which kicks in after dragon rage ends
[1:46:04] caveman2x: @mixj1 dev is prolly the tankiest caster in the game ? lol
[1:46:06] TsvDorn: lets start a petition to just end this shit Dungeon after the Door has opened. Better for everyone involved

[1:49:45] Rangoras: I'm suprised nobody has broken out the havoc DH for this dungeon.  You can do some wall jumping and gliding to get past the 2nd boss gate and pull demons from above into the boss.
[1:49:54] bogarola: Am I watching at the wrong times, or is the map pull very limited? Every other map is AD or BRH?

[2:03:27] atelectasis: repectable
[2:03:28] Ringmaster_Remina: o7 group keys
[2:03:31] tjawor: just delete accounts if depleted
[2:03:33] Kurtisthelol: you have to sacrifice a piece of loot
[2:03:33] Finnomenon: firstGarf BASED
[2:03:35] Corgi_Flops: Blizzard charges you money whenever you deplete.
[2:03:43] cirque78: Love that iteration
[2:03:44] ludosquoo: baseg great take
[2:03:44] AzzaHub: PopNemo
[2:03:45] mrozonmrozon: thats seems nice
[2:03:45] nightst314: when does it reset charges?
[2:03:46] custom025: I would never pug a key again
[2:03:49] iamknowledge: charges sound amazing
[2:03:50] duckdaring: It's hard enough to find a group without that penalty.
[2:03:53] mrozonmrozon: he cooked
[2:03:55] Cabs_Gaming: 5 depletes a week and then you cant log into your character
[2:03:55] FeelsgachiBASSMan: thats grierfable beyond oblivion OMEGALUL
[2:03:56] Nekrans: Actual cook off of an insane take
[2:03:56] thunder993: That is a terrible idra
[2:03:57] yelp26: you should be able to not deplete by paying 5$
[2:03:57] FewdewTwitch: I think too many depletes should result in bans. 3 depletes 4 hour ban. 3 more and its now a day. Throw a final boss? perma.
[2:03:59] MullbertXD: how about when you deplete instead of getting gear from the chest at the end 2 people randomly lose one piece of gear
[2:04:00] thunder993: Idea*
[2:04:01] Zulfasaurus: every death drops your own key down a level in a run
[2:04:07] Spartany25: yeah great lets make people in lfg even MORE picky...good idea /s
[2:04:10] Messi779: dude charges on the key is legit a good idea
[2:04:12] Nox1o: so you grief 4 people if you leave, not jsut 1
[2:04:13] thatsmybis: Let people use wow tokens to reset a key PepeLaugh
[2:04:13] aelysqt: deplete lowers your rio
[2:04:13] sh4ndooo: It should be like ARENA, u lose RIO
[2:04:14] Esotraz: @yelp26 and a timed key with 10$
[2:04:15] BriGuy271: it's a big fucking problem
[2:04:16] thoromyr19: leavers are toxic af
[2:04:16] Taytor: It's a plague in under 20s.
[2:04:17] Messi779: 3 charges on a key would be insane
[2:04:18] duckdaring: @FewdewTwitch Keep cooking
[2:04:18] Hydrixi: i hate playing with random players
[2:04:18] Nox1o: thats motivation for griefers
[2:04:19] PiaanoMain: they bad in early 20's
[2:04:20] jerkmcgee: it feels like leavers are less of a problem now than they have been
[2:04:20] lilhoe: HSWP trogalBoom PowerUpL trogalMVPeasant PowerUpR trogalBoom HSWP perfectly medium rare cook!
[2:04:22] rexxantik: in lower keys they're the biggest plague
[2:04:23] calming_insanity: it's a thing for sure
[2:04:24] Fizzbot125: Yea cause you don't pug anything under like, 22
[2:04:26] Ok_Kingston: less than 60 sec Rise
[2:04:32] Monsuno: A tank pulled the entire left side in my +18 Atal, we wiped, he left.
[2:04:33] Zingerac: leavers are bad at 20s
[2:04:36] Nickystr1x: 21-24 leaver culture is real
[2:04:36] hunterzx: leavers is a huge problem in lower keys... probably 18-24s kinda. when it gets higher ppl value reps a bit more
[2:04:36] Rinboo: depleate a key your char is dead. Harcord M+
[2:04:37] RDFrosty: Keys honestly should work like d3 greater rift keystones. You go to a dungeon pick a level and go.
[2:04:39] jmw566: Leaving used to be so much worse in legion/bfa
[2:04:39] mybootyisasnack: just give an extra reward for finishing keys besides a guaranteed 50g some type of token or something
[2:04:39] soraCH: it depends what you want to out of the key
[2:04:40] RaneEU: no one will ever to keys outside of group if this would be the case
[2:04:45] cixxay: Above 25 leavers are non existent
[2:04:50] lewhitehd69: if the key is turbo depleto im outta there peepoLeave
[2:04:51] EppatTV: you don't pug anything lower than 23, that's why you don't see them lol
[2:04:53] jerkmcgee: harder to deplete keys now so less leavers
[2:04:54] Corgi_Flops: I don't invite people that don't have depleted keys
[2:04:55] greaterlock: io should show all attempts
[2:04:55] TheZIXIS: why would someone care if their 10 drops if they leave someones 18 :D
[2:04:57] fleks27: people leave as soon as they think timer is dead (even if it isnt)
[2:04:59] nightst314: overall in time ratio went from 80 to 85 to 90% from S1 to S3 @Maximum
[2:05:00] fleks27: just fully unaware
[2:05:00] ItsYent: people who "leave" in 20+ arent leavers the key is usually dead and not worth doing a no leaver key lol
[2:05:01] tirbarik: A lot A lot
[2:05:02] ochrejokre: tbh im still waiting for round two of max and growl undercover bricking keys
[2:05:04] goekenaitor: ain’t no way I’m wasting an hour in a +10 alt hearing key
[2:05:05] Azurtri: When you've played league of legends and literally been held prisoner for 50 minutes because someone left and you can't leave without getting punished, you no longer care if someone leaves a key in wow
[2:05:06] duckdaring: don't deplete the key. deplete the reward
[2:05:09] taanzfour: tanks be like: start key, pull everything , die in 10 seconds, leave
[2:05:10] vente97: if you deplete you have to wear a clown hat until next timed key
[2:05:11] Cabs_Gaming: had someone pull up to the first ravager in ToTT bursting week, instantly got there, took one shot and died, instantly left
[2:05:12] wobble_tv: yeah anything above like a 24 people just gg
[2:05:13] sabiklol: had a guy kick my tank friend from his 20 wcm the other day bc he pulled 2nd boss with lust on CD
[2:05:17] Zorto5: lower keys want more completion for gear n stuff tho
[2:05:17] Sokerida: @Maximum  When will you do some Dh m+ ?
[2:05:19] NotD4k: even on the first week of the tier people left if the 18 wasnt timed Dentge
[2:05:20] Raggu2: only with the keyholders permission. Why would you sign up for something you dont want to finish
[2:05:24] Quillydadruid: surrender vote
[2:05:29] Deatheran: no one gives a shit if you have a failed 23 on your raider IO anymore. i dont think
[2:05:29] PiaanoMain: i had 3 happen in 11's yesterday
[2:05:29] jerkmcgee: YEP
[2:05:29] Ryepizor: They need to have like a surrender vote. if you leave without the vote, then you get locked out of keys for 24 hrs
[2:05:32] breekicheeki9: YEP
[2:05:33] cixxay: That shit stops somewhere around 25
[2:05:34] kesslive: big issue is pugs think keys have to go perfect to time, so they leave on the first wipe insta
[2:05:36] thatsmybis: They die during lust and rage quit because their overall is ruined
[2:05:40] brosciencegym: @Maximum  Gromnak is a leaver
[2:05:40] sh4ndooo: RIO should display LEAVE count
[2:05:42] Wyndril: Happens more the lower you go in key level, frequent in 20-24
[2:05:45] IveRelapsed: @Quillydadruid lmfao, some guy dies after a missed interrupt and spams surrender vote for the entire key
[2:05:45] TheItalianStallion321: ROCKY
[2:05:46] RaneEU: Aware
[2:05:46] thoromyr19: vote abandon key function
[2:05:48] TheItalianStallion321: ADRIAN
[2:05:49] Lindorn_: KEKW
[2:05:50] kriso95bgbg: o7
[2:05:55] thunder993: For vault
[2:05:55] knersh_: leavers are usually tanks and heals
[2:05:56] kinglumpio: Using Rocky's the worst!
[2:05:56] TJKlaenn: HUH
[2:05:56] Nox1o: surrender vote otherwise you get deserter debuff
[2:05:57] eggs_boiled: had a healer leave a 24 brh because he died to rocks on stairs....key was free
[2:06:00] wowsecretart: i think leavers arent that bad this season cause timers are easy
[2:06:02] nightst314: didn't hear no bell
[2:06:03] rudejerk: @Ryepizor ya just what we need, to be held hostage by a group of people who think their dead key is doable
[2:06:05] kinglumpio: Now the key will be timed, because it's Rocky.
[2:06:06] Esotraz: but that depleted key is gonna have my avoidance gearpiece
[2:06:08] treesuum: I had a paladin tank in a pug 25 WCM and got all the way to the trash before 4th boss and said i didnt sign up to do HW keys and left the key @Maximum
[2:06:15] skFriberg: @Esotraz KEKW
[2:06:16] kj01a: I always go for completion
[2:06:16] wobble_tv: yes
[2:06:17] iamknowledge: it happens a lot in UNDER 20s.
[2:06:18] TheLuo: The high the key level the less leaving you see
[2:06:21] nekitamocika: U never played with Russian Resto Druids Aware
[2:06:23] exomaths: LUL
[2:06:23] Ionized4: HOLY baseg
[2:06:23] cixxay: TRUE
[2:06:26] breekicheeki9: lot of 18 keys it happens lol
[2:06:26] Finnomenon: OMEGALUL
[2:06:27] GrimFandango: baseg
[2:06:28] BeaverCiv: baseg
[2:06:28] Monsuno: People will instaquit a +20 if you EVER wipe.
[2:06:30] RaneEU: OMEGALUL
[2:06:31] ponez: LUL
[2:06:46] thunder993: I only do 20s, because that is only reward outside of title
[2:06:47] Sleicreider: It's sucks knowing weekly+20 due to getting vault
[2:06:47] jmw566: give people tmog for like 3k, 3.1, 3.2 etc
[2:06:49] Esotraz: put myth track on 24s EZ
[2:06:52] iamknowledge: it happens from 0-20. anything 21+ everyone is normally on same page when key is depleted.
[2:07:00] Tsinis: i do  24 when i want weekly  but  20's are too boring
[2:07:07] Finnomenon: where people think they are good but arent and people who are good are stuck getting key up
[2:07:09] theskot: a ton of people get stuck in the low 20s because of how aw]ful the groups can be
[2:07:12] Lothland: There is 1800 level rewards and title reward but no "glad" reward in M+
[2:07:13] reality_3: barren and desolate LUL
[2:07:18] Wyndril: so true, there is a hellscape of keys in that range xD
[2:07:19] eggs_boiled: pugging has made me hate healers in m+
[2:07:20] Raggu2: jb sounded like he wasnt M+ +
[2:07:21] cirque78: If there was another reward for 3k hell yeah
[2:07:22] jmw566: it's gonna feel bad when my group is 3500 and has nothing to show for it because title is like 3600+
[2:07:22] purplejesusss: THE REASON IS TO GET BETTER AT THE GAME
[2:07:23] Swinkyy7: @Monsuno its worse than that, I've had a whole day where people quit a 20+ if anyone dies once during the first big pull
[2:07:23] DrQuackzalver: just one more reward tier, surely it will be good COPIUM
[2:07:24] Raggu2: wants*
[2:07:25] zelcione: top 1% would be lit. like gladiator in pvp
[2:07:28] Convection: Lower the cooldown on the ports
[2:07:29] Zingerac: and 22's have the people who absoltuely should not be doing above 20 but do it anyway
[2:07:31] vente97: you get max track vault gear at 18, 20 are just for portals
[2:07:34] Millertime567: ya ui've 3 chested some 20s then immediately downed my key back to a 20
[2:07:38] Cabs_Gaming: coulc create an end of season reward cosmetic or title for an echelon of different scores
[2:07:45] Taytor: 20% extra chance at a drop for each level above 20 @Maximum
[2:07:48] Aveloud: I get 3k every season then usually stop playing so ~24’s high as I go
[2:07:49] skFriberg: you can basically get BiS doing only 18's which is weird
[2:07:51] Tsinis: @Lothland the M+ title is the equivalent of the glad  0.1%  but M+ is way more competitive
[2:07:56] ddepan: It's still heroic gear that drops
[2:07:56] nightst314: You are basically done at week8
[2:07:57] Ringmaster_Remina: I found 15-19 have some people who are REAL sweaty and leave on 1 wipe, no matter the cause. They start getting filtered about 18 though so it lowers
[2:08:03] GrimFandango: @Taytor nobody wants Hero gear when you're playing above 20 tho
[2:08:10] e_lwo: would cosmetics encourage players to do 22+ runs?
[2:08:11] Akraoz: You need something to strive for between keystonemaster and 0.1% to motivate ppl
[2:08:12] eggs_boiled: you can get bis by drooling in 18s....
[2:08:19] FieldMedic_Feywyn: You get the great gift of 3 IO points.
[2:08:20] soraCH: TRUE
[2:08:21] Zorto5: trueee
[2:08:22] LionButLeon: season mounts are legit ass xdd
[2:08:23] thatsmybis: Yea reskin of an ugly looking mount is not good enough
[2:08:25] goekenaitor: ilvl is not that way to go
[2:08:26] fdb33: if there’s increased chance of tertiaries then it becomes a necessary farm and that’d b rough, sockets would be good imo :)
[2:08:26] Wildfire_Gaming: DF seasonal mounts are turbo garbage
[2:08:26] yonima: idc about mounts lol
[2:08:26] Monsuno: @Swinkyy7 Yeah that's cringe. I had to kick a guild member yesterday for flaming other guildies in a +15
[2:08:27] krazeturtle: @Maximum the issue will keep cycling. If they give more rewards for higher key levels, people are gonna be upset if they can't get it, so they'll nerf the dungeons so more people can get it, and we'll have the same issue as b4
[2:08:27] EppatTV: you literally got that KEKW
[2:08:28] exomaths: At least some amazing cosmetics like BFA legendary essence effects
[2:08:28] theskot: the mount is so ass lol
[2:08:29] Polowy: LUL
[2:08:29] Coriollis: all good mounts go to store
[2:08:30] dubbyatt: make the mount better and need more io
[2:08:30] fleks27: enable boobslider if you timed all 25s and m+ numbers skyrocket
[2:08:31] soraCH: the DF mounts were so bad
[2:08:32] Emimi100: This season is nice but I hate the fact that if you're non meta you're basically never picked, even if you clearly have the dps and utility or the level you apply to
[2:08:32] Lindorn_: LUL
[2:08:33] greaterlock: it sucks trying to go for title when the top players make alts at title range making it harder for other players to get it
[2:08:33] lewhitehd69: mail muncher LETSGO
[2:08:33] Clush___: @Maximum give us pvp talents + pvp trinket bonus but for M+
[2:08:34] duckdaring: I was once in a +3 where the group kept chain wiping to Mistcaller and they rage quit because I didn't know what an acorn was.
[2:08:35] patti221: @Akraoz true
[2:08:35] Lothland: @Tsinis yeah glad title, not "glad though" 2400 rewards
[2:08:37] not_Hivee: We got an expansion that brough Dragonriding and they give us ground mounts  for KSM -.-
[2:08:40] Frostb8te: Shadowlands mounts were so good
[2:08:42] Tw0f0r0n3: TRUE
[2:08:44] thunder993: They need 3k mount
[2:08:45] SlowboLaggins: the mount this time being a ground mount all expansion sucked
[2:08:46] thezyok: the prideful mount literally was the mount that season lol
[2:08:47] cixxay: Credit cards are the ultimate form of rewarding gameplay
[2:08:48] Swinkyy7: I think not getting Myth track gear from the chest instead of only vault really killed any drive to go above +20
[2:08:49] MythicSam: i love buying mounts instead of earning them :D
[2:08:54] wowsecretart: jpc missing the point of the convo
[2:08:54] thezyok: except it was black
[2:08:56] TheLuo: It's like the different between CE and RWF - there just isn't any reason to do anything more if you're getting CE unless you're going for a top ranking.  Applies to M+. Once you get KSH, you go for portals. Once you get portals you're like 2700ish. There just isn't any reason to go for 3k+ unless you're going for title. HUGE gap in rewards.
[2:09:04] Tsinis: @Lothland that's true and i agree
[2:09:07] gabenlift: @maximum when you guys say “way more people would play M+” are you specifically talking about like 27+? or just a general statement?
[2:09:07] soraCH: delves give mythic gear
[2:09:08] taanzfour: @thezyok No it wasnt, it was similar, but it wasnt.
[2:09:08] nerefwow: hard agree
[2:09:09] soraCH: xD
[2:09:14] LionButLeon: DRATTY Pog
[2:09:16] honeychonker: We need a Vicious saddle type mount for keys

[2:09:34] RaneEU: Ye put Gear in Shop Pog
[2:09:34] greaterlock: 25s should drop myth track gear
[2:09:35] exomaths: LETS GO
[2:09:35] Wildfire_Gaming: 🐳
[2:09:36] xkillergod: last fated
[2:09:36] holla____: xdd
[2:09:36] santalylth: ah gear lets get it
[2:09:36] Samppson: I think it should be like pvp rewards, need more stuff between the 2500io (ksh) and 0.1% title, should have some tiered titles for like top 1 percent, top 3 percent, top 5 percent
[2:09:38] MHMabrito: Lemme buy my bis week 1
[2:09:38] Deatheran: i get that you cant have myth gear dropping ealy on. but its exausting to rely on vault exclusively for myth track for those of us who dont raid but run higher M+
[2:09:38] periphrase: ok jb
[2:09:38] TheItalianStallion321: IM GAME $2 a piece
[2:09:39] thunder993: Baseg
[2:09:39] Lothland: @Tsinis adding something in the middle would make working between the two worth it and maybe people find out they like it enough/improve enough to try for the title
[2:09:40] GH0STtdi: then no one would raid
[2:09:43] Saahf: what magic is tettles hair?
[2:09:43] wildcherrybepsi: Dinar
[2:09:44] cixxay: USD
[2:09:44] wobble_tv: lmao sell me a rageheart
[2:09:44] nevotheless: 💳
[2:09:46] soraCH: you mean dollars? KEKW
[2:09:47] IveRelapsed: people would just farm the easiest keys and use the currency to upgrade. you're describing valor
[2:09:51] ThreesFG: And that currency is USD
[2:09:51] Maruika: what is on that guys head
[2:09:52] greenmachine11235: Each time you're ineligible for a raid item or pass/sell an item from mythic+ you get a shard of X that eventually lets you upscale an item
[2:09:52] Beat0n: KEKW
[2:09:53] reggiepowa: BASED
[2:09:56] DjekHex: why not make it so if you time a 25+ you get myth track gear from end of dungon but only if you time.
[2:09:57] lumaday: Pvp gearing is nice'
[2:09:58] exomaths: $5 to put a socket on an item
[2:10:00] IveRelapsed: it would de-incentivize high keys
[2:10:00] MHMabrito: I'd pay $20 for a myth track dungeon trinket
[2:10:00] voteforpedro064: @honeychonker we need more mounts or be able to turn the saddles in for conq or something and not just have a 50 stack in my bank
[2:10:00] Coriollis: just give chance for one of the rare 10 years ago mounts to drop but idk tradepost must earn mo money xdd
[2:10:03] vente97: remove soulbound, everything is buyable
[2:10:05] marsagoxd: they should implement a prophecie system where you select item you want to drop, and timing runs past a certain key level increases the chance to get it to drop
[2:10:07] Monsuno: @GH0STtdi Raid has different gear
[2:10:07] xkillergod: not the dinar itself but the upgrade system from dinar
[2:10:11] nightst314: yes please, more rewards for the top 10% and nothing for the  90%
[2:10:13] tirbarik: coin in vault instead of sockets you can get upgrade item
[2:10:13] Spartanate: Why use danar when I can use da card?
[2:10:14] Rocklenry: take the token system from vault and let people buy a track upgrade with it

[4:27:26] Mazmerized: lowkey fronk would go hard seeing how things are from his perspective
[4:27:31] Nox1o: that wouldnt bang in viewer numbers i think
[4:27:34] poklepkin: just talk about how retail is dogshit, always relevant
[4:27:37] sudd7: about your dogs
[4:27:37] hatad: is the raid scene growing in wow?
[4:27:45] ruediruempel: JB  has some wild takes but most of it makes sense LUL

[4:28:23] eazye503: you need a “JB’s Hot Take of the Week” segment
[4:28:23] Nox1o: that sounds like a end of s4 podcast
[4:28:26] Naemesis: sup @tntqt96
[4:28:26] JamaBear: yeah @Maximum do that. remember? you're that tier-list guy KEKW

[4:28:49] BabyDunn: i miss corruptions peepoSad
[4:28:50] FroTheBeard: BFA had infested, terrible
[4:28:55] BlackFatElmo: turbo WOW was so fun
[4:28:56] FieldMedic_Feywyn: Pride at full stacks.
[4:28:56] Tomq0: bfa s4 GIGACHAD
[4:28:58] fzybny: S3/4 SL was way up there.
[4:28:59] thefuntown: mind goes straight to infested and azerite gear not dropping from m+
[4:29:02] sudd7: Torghast > M+ :)
[4:29:03] meatballblastero: bfa only had one bad seasonal
[4:29:05] Phorxor: BFA season 1 monkaW
[4:29:06] Yenlovrah: Legion early seasons legendaries was dog so last patch can be fire
[4:29:08] Xastin3: season 4 wasnt aclly good. classes were just corruption procs
[4:29:09] wobble_tv: as long as we never see skittish again
[4:29:13] Nickystr1x: i just wish i could be a fly on the wall at the meeting where infested got approved
[4:29:13] kitty0chi: heres a topic: why doesn't blizz put m+ at the same lvk as mythic raiding? why is it just a bit below...
[4:29:13] krazeturtle: season 3 slands was the best m+ season ever tbh
[4:29:20] muonz: @Naemesis XD
[4:29:22] zerossussy: bfa season 1 was the worst affix of all time
[4:29:30] MeisterChiefX: beguiling might be the worst affix theyve ever made
[4:29:45] Nox1o: idk who thought damage reflect enemy was a good idea
[4:29:48] Naemesis: @Tobo ⛴️
[4:29:50] Nox1o: same bs in poe
[4:30:00] booznoon: think people are critical enough now that literally no one would play and they'd have to change it
[4:30:11] jberry: garf
[4:30:12] Naemesis: @muonz nerd
[4:30:15] TJKlaenn: Systems? RAGEY
[4:30:26] Troniin: no
[4:30:27] talmadimtv: not really lol tyrannical was doable but you had set comps
[4:30:30] guynormally: dirt went so hard
[4:30:33] Kryous: Nope
[4:30:34] Kawatteruwow: bring ap back
[4:30:35] thenateo2: dirt stonks
[4:30:36] eazye503: SEEDS BABY
[4:30:38] Owlcopwn: top .1% speaking for the masses, surely he's not out of touch
[4:30:39] paragorr: no im good lol
[4:30:39] Mazmerized: Like korthia? Pausechamp
[4:30:39] Yenlovrah: Susge
[4:30:40] BabyDunn: reputation. easy
[4:30:41] thefuntown: the kids yearn for the mines
[4:30:42] blacklight_____: dragonflight week 1 owned
[4:30:57] Yenlovrah: Rares before Mythic 0
[4:30:59] Risom5: Risom5 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! You're like a young Santa Claus for WoW
[4:31:02] wobble_tv: like the onyx annulet?
[4:31:08] Joneim: The children yearn for the mines
[4:31:11] Kryous: The only thing in WoW I farm is gear. FeelsGoodMan
[4:31:11] Taytor: It was just because there was fucking else to do
[4:31:12] dashwinsta: I think it provides something to do for those who don't immediately do +15s tho
[4:31:16] Taytor: All that shit stopped the moment M+ opened up
[4:31:17] fzybny: Counter point, the Benthic gear grind
[4:31:17] dashwinsta: Important for gamers
[4:31:19] booznoon: i remember blasting the forbidden reach for nothing
[4:31:20] iLLuuu: you did it, because other content wasnt out yet
[4:31:21] Tsinis: it was just fun because your whole guild would do it
[4:31:24] Tsinis: it was a community thing
[4:31:26] BabyDunn: peak casual classic asmon
[4:31:29] JamaBear: @Maximum it's called "conditioning"
[4:31:42] legendarism: im banned in asmongold channel thats not me :)
[4:31:46] Piroshkiii: Idiots attract idiots.
[4:31:50] Nox1o: the thing is, there was nothing else today and a hype for new content at the same time. Ppl just wanted to game
[4:31:52] BabyDunn: @legendarism me too bud
[4:31:55] Nox1o: and there was nothing to game
[4:31:57] honkblarg: people will fiend over any bit of power they can get
[4:31:59] leubinator: wowplayers crave for the mines
[4:32:03] Nox1o: to do*
[4:32:04] diggerman111: do you think its because wow puts us into insane content drought?
[4:32:06] Jirofanboy: just only make it mount and transmog
[4:32:08] Jirofanboy: I beg
[4:32:13] eazye503: I ran 100 keys week one of the season
[4:32:22] TJKlaenn: @eazye503 wtf
[4:32:23] graydayday: Rare farm in s1 was a "pre-bis" before m+ came, and ppl love BiS
[4:32:27] meatballblastero: @fzybny benthic wasnt bad because it was a grind it had way deeper issues
[4:32:33] Lothland: Have AP with a decently "moderate" cap
[4:32:38] Rhinocerous87: do legendaries still belong in retail
[4:32:39] IveRelapsed: you guys are literally describing renown
[4:32:39] alberticusprime: timeless isle frogs, jsut add new mounts and transmog and let em go back
[4:32:40] BabyDunn: sooo bring back legion artifacts then?lol
[4:32:41] captnmichael: Laughs in job system
[4:32:46] Kawatteruwow: farming coruptions was the best shit - you could finish it and there was always something to do besides m+/raid
[4:32:47] Lothland: and not the make your eyes bleed island levels
[4:32:50] argalanmg: the players. they yearn for the mines
[4:33:17] Willthewhite1943: 180 take.   a whole season with NO AFFExis
[4:33:24] Kryous: @Jirofanboy True! I don't like farming in WoW, but I WILL farm for Mogs. They should add more dances and spell colors/animations throughout the game. Give us more reason to play, not click dirt or AP grind.
[4:33:26] dashwinsta: Each potential piece of dragon loot means you don't need that item from dungeons in week 1
[4:33:26] Jirofanboy: ?????
[4:33:27] domax92: gdkp sucks, never tried but i can imagine. if i pay for an item i want to get boosted, otherwise we roll for it idc. i'm not boosting a bunch of noobs and then pay for the item lol @Maximum
[4:33:31] BruhItsKoda1: THD INCOMING
[4:33:33] Jirofanboy: We do it because it feels mandatory
[4:33:35] Owlcopwn: making something mandatory isnt always good, something can be fun without needing a big payout
[4:33:38] nyshindysheen: im an addict maximumBeak
[4:33:38] TJKlaenn: WideTHD grind with power?
[4:33:39] Rhop: I think it's only good because it gives you a marginal at best improvement for an absurd amount of effort, so it doesn't feel bad if you don't do it
[4:33:40] BabyDunn: @Maximum isnt that basically the crests?
[4:33:41] OakProudArt: it needs to be a bit of power that is good like for 1 - 3 weeks and irrelevant later
[4:33:43] seltzee: Delves seem like that might fit
[4:33:47] Xastin3: there no power to grind so there no reason to grind
[4:33:52] zerossussy: bfa necklace
[4:33:54] Xastin3: grinding for power is fun
[4:33:55] IveRelapsed: you're describing ap
[4:33:57] Synk_live: once there is any power, its deemed as required
[4:33:58] FieldMedic_Feywyn: Kind of like crests?
[4:33:58] bollhoj: @Maximum you mean kinda like making renown relevant?
[4:34:01] IveRelapsed: the game is better without ap
[4:34:01] ctg_dreamz: It's actual good cosmetics and mounts. People go ape shit for that
[4:34:02] Zorto5: add agility
[4:34:06] BruhItsKoda1: WideTHD
[4:34:06] BurntMrWaffles: i think that forces far more people to do something they dont want to do
[4:34:15] argalanmg: small scale AP
[4:34:15] Owlcopwn: once something becomes reuqired it's a lot less fun
[4:34:15] Xevenna: I farmed rares for lariat recipe forever. Finally just bought the damn thing.
[4:34:16] hunterzx: i think theres nothing to do, people log in and streamers are grinding... so we grind too
[4:34:21] Rhop: I think it needs to barely matter if you don't do it
[4:34:23] SheffyWoW: i miss islands FeelsGoodEnoughMan
[4:34:24] AtosL: @Maximum neck that gives +5% stats for every grind you finished
[4:34:32] poklepkin: people have nothing better to do in their life. these farms are brainless boring and mostly pointless thing
[4:34:33] AqB_Live: wasnt it kinda the 100.000 gold main stat item you could get from renoun?
[4:34:36] Risom5: @SheffyWoW YEP
[4:34:38] goesidd: if people wanna farm nothing, let them. to force the people who dont wanna farm to also farm is just silly
[4:34:40] IveRelapsed: "ap but not really ap" is what led to renown being developed in shadowlands
[4:34:43] jannekvarnc: this was a design philosophy from one of the early main wow game designers, like as simple as adding +1 agi people would spend 20 hours to get just to have something to grind towards
[4:34:51] Jirofanboy: @Kryous Like I am high end so I dont really care about that and will only do it because it is mandetory but for cool tmog I would consider it. Yeah like just make it more tmog and those ideas you have is pretty good actually
[4:35:07] goesidd: korthia sockets
[4:35:13] Szain3: DinoDance
[4:35:13] Dyllabus: seems like just putting cool cosmetics to grind for is the easy answer
[4:35:17] mozerra: peepoComfy is this poddyc
[4:35:24] ogbuckwheats: dinars were goated
[4:35:41] BabyDunn: they better bring them back so i can insta buy my raz bow again
[4:35:42] Xastin3: god im still frming heart... its awful
[4:35:53] Tsaebahcus007: I still dont have ashes
[4:35:56] Tsaebahcus007: xdd
[4:36:06] ZizzTV: fyrakk is better rng or whut xd ?
[4:36:21] alarkin: Just buying the item from a vendor with a dinar is not the same though - because it's actually guaranteed - you can run lfr-mythic and still not see an item
[4:36:21] Owlcopwn: i just ate dinar
[4:36:28] zerossussy: dinar has to be on all seasons
[4:36:38] guynormally: xddPeat
[4:36:40] IveRelapsed: i'm for more deterministic stuff in wow, esp for m+ gear. but i'm strongly against anything that resembles ap.
[4:36:45] Zarroe: xddPeat
[4:36:47] AqB_Live: yeah i never understood why you would do a higher key, than the one that gives you hero gear in M+
[4:36:47] Kryous: How many pieces of gear exist in a full raid clear? Now, compare that to how many pieces of gear exist in a season of Mythic+? We need something to help with this gap imo.
[4:36:47] Havocados: baseg 󠀀
[4:36:55] Taytor: XDD
[4:36:56] Wildfire_Gaming: RIPBOZO
[4:37:08] TheItalianStallion321: i like Dorki. he seems like such a chill guy
[4:37:10] Strudel115: i want my greater essence for 489 iridal
[4:37:10] Zorto5: dorki dragged off to prison Deadge
[4:37:40] OG_Kawngi: TrollDespair
[4:37:44] 3dobbee: what about a preferred item slot where you can say the items you want and if they dont drop they have a slightly higher drop rate week on week for m+?
[4:38:00] domax92: vgdkp sucks, never tried but i can imagine. if i pay for an item i want to get boosted, otherwise we roll for it idc. i'm not boosting a bunch of noobs and then pay for the item lol, it's not just rmt gdkp is stupid by itself

[4:43:06] astronomiculeu: I lost an apartment due to my flatmate not paying his rent - he should of asked id of covered it
[4:43:06] synixqt: @Maximum - Do you ever think blizzard will entertain the idea of 10 man raids in a relevant manner again.
[4:43:08] Phob0slol: TRUEEEEE
[4:43:15] TJKlaenn: M+ Timewalkin- wait.
[4:43:17] schiavetto: challenge modes rework
[4:43:18] Shad_WW: mop challenge modes are back
[4:43:26] domax92: i would love it
[4:43:28] priceytbh: Timerunning pandemonium is just the fucking Murloc running quest from the end of the main story where you sonic the hedgehog through different points in time

[4:43:51] Malicone: did you know blizzard killed 80 % of 10 man guilds. 10 man is popular. (:-
[4:43:52] Tsaebahcus007: CM were so fun
[4:43:55] MrChaCho: let the hell break loose in my opion
[4:43:55] ColdIceCreamMan: fuck the transmog gatekeepers
[4:44:05] asd123qwerty1: @maximum when do you think we get fated?
[4:44:10] nightst314: challenge modes are at a +10 level once a season starts
[4:44:10] dango0n: I miss cm's
[4:44:11] Zhiovanni: It makes sense that we will have a Pandaria Dark heart Patch/ Prepatch, with the idea of Pirates near the place we start the expansion just West of the Pandaria Island, so Timewalking TOT could be in there
[4:44:16] kj01a: Were challenge modes just baby M+?
[4:44:17] hi_im_Xenn: having super exclusive shit exclusive forever if you can accomplish the goal is cringe
[4:44:18] Fanatilt: You could 2 man them
[4:44:18] OlaF_oo: mythic time walking raids are a waste of resources
[4:44:18] Rendlaws: its gona be mop dungeon in mplus like they did with legion once
[4:44:19] SpeedyMcD: Fomo is terrible. Bring back mage tower appearances as well
[4:44:25] zerossussy: cm is outdated @dango0n
[4:44:26] Azkrust: I’m faded RN
[4:44:27] thecajuncommie: ppl would be weird about it, and the challenge mode mod is still top tier, but I got it by paying gold for a boost...its not a big deal to give it to more ppl
[4:44:29] eyeztea: i dont get these unobtainable items. like why not let people get what they want
[4:44:29] TyHeals: @Maximum 10.2.6 actual relevant non casual content?
[4:44:35] callmejingus: i dont think they have reason to change the raiding formula anymore tbh
[4:44:36] Xastin3: wow retail is in maintenance mode with no endgame content updates
[4:44:37] Fanatilt: People were 2 man boosting both in mop and wod
[4:44:38] Zaisx: I
[4:44:47] Teeemosh: LOGIN
[4:44:48] Tsaebahcus007: What if they would open 10 man mythic a month after the launch of the raid?
[4:44:48] Clarius: Its kinda insane what m+ has done for the general skill level of the average player.
[4:44:49] TheLuo: Idea for high end 'mog' rewards. You get a token to unlock any mog from your appearance book.
[4:44:49] Tsaebahcus007: Or like 2 weeks
[4:44:59] Zaisx: I'd like to see more endgame systems. Hoping delves is goid
[4:45:02] Zaisx: good*
[4:45:02] oafa066: M+ was added in legion? thought it was the end of wod?
[4:45:03] mino661: what is delves?
[4:45:10] Bubblehealftw: I miss 10 man raiding
[4:45:13] zerossussy: u think mop scenario's could have potential of new content?
[4:45:15] callmejingus: delves will be as relevnat as warfornts, screenshot this
[4:45:21] Lukeker: SOD is all 10 man bois come on over
[4:45:27] OsyrissTV: Earthen Allied Race gonna be lit Kreygasm
[4:45:37] Veszyx_: Wait, so @Maximum literally used to engineer systems for a living? HMMMGE. maximumP
[4:45:39] nightst314: Delves are probably better than MoP scenarios by default
[4:45:40] Aqinog: mop scenarios werent very good
[4:45:42] Tidewell: 10 man raiding? Paragon would like to have a word Nerdge
[4:45:47] EFFSIN: 10 man challenge mode Poggers
[4:45:49] NotQuid: mop scenarios were just the slam for valor points farm
[4:45:53] TheoDeri: i agree mop scenarios were super mid but idk why mop was so sick
[4:45:54] KodyTheTyger: WoD was when Mythic dungeon difficulty was added
[4:45:55] asd123qwerty1: oh he knows xdd
[4:46:00] Rhinocerous87: do you think legendaries like what we've had in dragonflight still work in retail?
[4:46:08] timmi009: 10 man raiding will return a lot players
[4:46:16] BabyDunn: scenarios were just a pre-cursor to the scenario quests we have now
[4:46:29] Gobbomb: Bring back Cata legendaries and make em all personal loot
[4:46:31] greatangelsanguinius: artifacts
[4:46:31] captainnetz: Legion final patch legendaries was just 2 talent points you could wear
[4:46:32] sedael: ... i liked the mop capes
[4:46:35] Letholas: they were embellishments
[4:46:36] Bromgarr: I feel like the mop style one was just the best
[4:46:37] praysten: poddy c topic
[4:46:37] Letholas: essentially
[4:46:39] OG_Kawngi: Cata style
[4:46:41] sethomatic: cata legos best legos
[4:46:41] gimmesomeganjaa: what mythic+ key level would they have to make challenge modes to be relevant. +25?
[4:46:45] domax92: no, they don't work, you need a system of acquisition like shadowmourne of cata leggos
[4:46:45] Theliahh: nothing mop - bfa were real legendaries
[4:46:46] woahdudewhat: cata style behind quests
[4:46:47] vaerlyn: Cata for sure
[4:46:48] Mszemik1: ORANGE = LEGENDARY LUL
[4:46:49] Zingerac: Legion legendaries were also fucking terrible at the beginning of the expansion
[4:46:53] PangeaDruid: Aman'thuls is the best version of legendaries
[4:46:54] OG_Kawngi: Cata leggos bis
[4:46:56] callmejingus: i liked the wod ring
[4:46:57] greatangelsanguinius: classic leggos were best maybe shadowm
[4:46:58] sluckyslaw7: follower dungeons any good?
[4:46:59] guynormally: DF S1 bow legendary was best. It drops and you can equip it right there.
[4:47:01] sudd7: war glaives
[4:47:01] IveRelapsed: just bring back the mop/wod legendary
[4:47:03] Xastin3: legendaries in their current form... are skip the class that has legendaries cause blizzard balancing around legendary
[4:47:03] eazye503: I liked legendaries in legion but I was casual so it wasn’t a huge deal if I didn’t get BIS. But I would HATE it now
[4:47:04] IveRelapsed: it was the best
[4:47:04] Taxi_Service: legion had droppable legendaries. I remember Prydaz!!!
[4:47:08] zerossussy: wod rings were so much fun tho
[4:47:09] Yenlovrah: Orange is outdated cause things like Thunderfury were for finite tuned content and making that ez content easier
[4:47:10] Theliahh: @guynormally that wasnt a legendary lol
[4:47:13] nightst314: discount legendaries are bad when you are at the back-end of priority
[4:47:13] kj01a: When are they gonna add playable tuskarr race tho?
[4:47:15] sprechwe1se: you think theyll bring wrath or tbc dungs back at some point?
[4:47:20] Azkrust: It’s like farming world content ‘rare’ elites. When every zone has 10-20 rares, is it actually rare?
[4:47:22] synixqt: 10 man raiding would be game changing. Most of us who have been playing since Vanilla are 30+ years old with kids, wives / husbands, and careers. We can't commit to this 20 man hard raid schedule. But most of us have 5-10 people with play with constantly.
[4:47:24] MrChaCho: Was the WoD ring orange? I don't remember.
[4:47:26] Miiirrramar: healer leggo from ulduar, only one we have ever had
[4:47:29] nurkurzhier: 10 man raiding should be there for mythic + Gear upgradeable with Terti-Stats (like sockets, but easier to get.. ) In S4 they should make the Leggys from S2 and S3 uupgradeable @Maximum
[4:47:32] Gobbomb: @MrChaCho Yes
[4:47:34] ark_exitWound: Legendary is cool, but this bad luck is just a buzz kill :D
[4:47:35] Rafaelfrost_: tbc dungeons are great for M+
[4:47:38] justdubz_: i liked the legendary system in legion
[4:47:38] wilcozzz: that feeling is like getting your BIS trinket out of vault
[4:47:40] Xastin3: legendaries are just not worth it. yyour just 10 weeks of being weak
[4:47:45] Morayeden: The axe still doesn't mater
[4:47:49] nyshindysheen: nah
[4:47:49] BabyDunn: jailer mace should have been a legendary
[4:47:49] Simonhiii: @Maximum Do you miss BFA with corruption system?
[4:47:49] captainnetz: If legendaries stayed super rare but they were like a transmog item with sick effects that were exclusive to it, I feel like people would still pog about having it and not feel bad for not having it as much
[4:47:59] greatangelsanguinius: so rare doesnt work now because of player power
[4:48:02] nyshindysheen: axe is piss dont want it
[4:48:03] captainnetz: Like if the fyrakk axe had a bunch of exclusive fire animations
[4:48:08] TheRealTarrjue: I think the model just doesn't fit the current gamer community philosophies
[4:48:08] nyshindysheen: SP power
[4:48:11] Zhiovanni: The fact that 2H classes arent gods seems like a massive porblem
[4:48:14] Wozed: encouraging raid tours was nice in legion
[4:48:18] hi_im_Xenn: nostalgia + those old leggos looking fucking sick do some service to the feel of getting them
[4:48:20] greatangelsanguinius: the axe taking so long was bad because it was bugged, the bad luck didn't work thats fax no printer
[4:48:22] Yenlovrah: the difference is that beforehand was no infinite scaling content
[4:48:24] berchberkins: the only thing i feel is wrong with current leggo system is that like RN our main tank doesnt have axe but does H every week while lil jimmy got his weeks ago for a +16
[4:48:26] Pallyex53: just make the leggos cosmetic
[4:48:26] exshiftyxe: I am still trying to farm warglaives
[4:48:28] Xastin3: legendaries as system neeeds retired
[4:48:30] talmadimtv: blizzard ruined legos
[4:48:30] procotwitch: yeah for the people that got them
[4:48:31] majonly1: imagine if everyone got Thunderfury
[4:48:37] procotwitch: 4 months no axe btw
[4:48:40] ark_exitWound: getting Shadowmourne first on my server, i literally thought i was the lich king LUL
[4:48:41] Tsaebahcus007: @Maximum By the way, since they also brought T3 back maybe they will actually bring back CM mogs
[4:48:41] nurkurzhier: still i believe legendary should be obtainable, not only to few players
[4:48:42] Morayeden: Blizzard still stuck with boomer mentality. Nothing has changed.
[4:48:43] smashhammer: but the people changed and people feel that legos are mandatory making it a really bad experience for a lot of players (luckily I was no eligable) @Maximum what about legos for CE players only or some other hard content?
[4:48:45] TJKlaenn: The game has changed, as to where you feel incomplete without the axe as those classes.
[4:48:51] Rafaelfrost_: Forgot how close to the new expansion alpha we are
[4:48:52] callmejingus: or potentially never get
[4:48:55] daftna: legendary items would mean something to me the way blizzard wants if they weren't irrelevant the next season
[4:48:55] procotwitch: 4 months no axe btw 󠀀
[4:48:55] OakProudArt: we play games in a very different way that in 2007, theres no way to reproduce that anymore
[4:48:57] ark_exitWound: but part of that is just wrath > and dks
[4:49:00] Just1Time2: I feel for our Warriors and Paladins who dont have the Axe, even after our 2nd Mythic Reclear.
[4:49:04] captainnetz: Ok but no one cares about amanthuls after legion ended so I feel like making powerful legendaries over cool looking ones is the wrong path
[4:49:05] Scriix: unless you were my guild and you had 7! off hand warglaives and never dropped a mainhand
[4:49:07] TyHeals: Like Double-Time @ 489. Why do I gotta get UBER LUCKY in my vault xD
[4:49:09] MrChaCho: So should classes be tuned for not having the lego, make the lego super rare but really fucking strong, and if you get it you just get to bang?
[4:49:10] Na5noo5: what's is the revisited raid in s4 ? like every week we got different raid from 1 of the 3 seasons ?
[4:49:11] domax92: yes
[4:49:11] KodyTheTyger: Our raid group never got an axe until this recent RNG buff came in, kinda sucked
[4:49:12] weazem: yes
[4:49:13] domax92: that's fair
[4:49:14] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[4:49:15] codydoubleu: all games have a honeymoon period then everything in it after is intensely scrutinized
[4:49:15] Ukahen: yes
[4:49:16] Theliahh: I dont think it should ever be guaranteed
[4:49:17] kj01a: yes
[4:49:18] TJKlaenn: If the drop rate is low enough.
[4:49:18] Oorvik1: I mean, I went from bad to mid after getting it.. which doesn’t feel good
[4:49:19] leubinator: and the leggo was bad and had to be buffed multiple times KEKW
[4:49:20] Zhiovanni: What is the point of the leggo
[4:49:25] argalanmg: yes
[4:49:25] sprechwe1se: what changes would a tbc dung need to feature on m+ or any old dung for that matter
[4:49:29] Toorps_: THE war within? Thought it was called A war within
[4:49:30] BabyDunn: make legendary rarer and just have it break the meta
[4:49:34] EFFSIN: the warglaives was good cause it worked with rogues and warriors
[4:49:35] Theliahh: @Toorps_ TWW
[4:49:36] Taxi_Service: @maximum Just make legendaries drop a lot but only from last boss on Mythic
[4:49:36] Xastin3: legendaries shouldnt define the class... being gimped for weeks is bad and  not getting it feels bad
[4:49:39] callmejingus: imagine the drama if they did a scarab lord event again
[4:49:39] synixqt: es
[4:49:46] Xastin3: legendaries need to be retired
[4:49:53] minimi12001: @Toorps_ literally on the screen big dawg
[4:49:54] thegrt13: dragons had a lego last patch and they were good without it still
[4:49:57] captainnetz: No one cares about amanthuls after legion. I think focusing on its power and not its look is the wrong path to take
[4:50:02] alpibee: game got more competive , logs etc
[4:50:03] Bloosah: remember i was first horde on my old server to get shadowmourne and it truly felt badass.. now whit this axes.. meh
[4:50:04] OG_Kawngi: moon2JOKA
[4:50:11] nurkurzhier: when 10.2.6 is droopping?
[4:50:12] kj01a: People whining about not getting what they want isn't an ideaology
[4:50:18] yelp26: make Legendaries like Val'Anyr again. I want to see guilds crash and burn over it
[4:50:19] BadMicro: YEP its a bummer but its the way the games have evolved
[4:50:22] Shpleen: if my class gets a leggo announced I would probably reroll for that patch to not have to deal with it based on the last 2 patches
[4:50:23] RandaIFire: imagine if somone does a key level higher because they have an item that makes their class do like 10% more damage
[4:50:24] zerossussy: thats true, pug M+ is corrupted based on meta classes
[4:50:25] JustDivis: would they be better making a new classification of gear for those ideal legendaries, ancestral or whatever other name they want for the super OP legendaries compared to the legion style
[4:50:28] Aemon__: hot take: make legendaries cosmetic only
[4:50:29] greatangelsanguinius: We dont need more loot issues though, the idea you have to farm 40+ keys for a sub max trinket because the vault will never give you it max is also a joke
[4:50:30] AtosL: It's literally why people disliked Legionaries
[4:50:30] Theliahh: @yelp26 so true
[4:50:31] Taxi_Service: @maximum what made warflaives special is the difficulty of killing Illidan for most players
[4:50:32] Szain3: DinoDance
[4:50:35] Toorps_: WTF!!!
[4:50:39] FerdaJets: Classic people are way more elitist and classist than retail though imo
[4:50:39] BabyDunn: ooo yeah bring back guild drama over legendaries. i miss sniping good players that way
[4:50:39] b1azzuris: WTF MAX
[4:50:40] Taytor: you say that, but if you went into a classic raid, it was just mage dps and warrior tanks
[4:50:40] iamthegodcomplex: Classic gamers care a lot about tier lists
[4:50:41] Klutch81: Do you think people's voices are louder now? with reddit, discords, streamers, etc?
[4:50:42] jandemain: how so
[4:50:43] weazem: hmmm kinda disagree
[4:50:44] alex_a29: gavel was more powerful than this leggo and that was a normal epic drop
[4:50:50] domax92: what if you do like smourne? you gotta have your guild funnel it to one player and that's it, everyone knows when they get it and you make it very strong and gg @Maximum
[4:50:50] Theliahh: what's funny is even in wrath classic they added bad luck protection to the old legendaries
[4:50:51] Sylnus: gachiGASM
[4:50:54] JamaBear: "Old" legendaries were over the moment they pondered to the "i could never get it but i still want it. i'm a paying customer" people
[4:50:54] Yenlovrah: SoD is legit just modern classic which makes it fun
[4:50:55] bot5_sloth: bot5_sloth subscribed with Prime. 
[4:50:56] fleks27: just killed last boss gnomeregan and my mage did 24 dps
[4:50:57] PNZTK: is he adhd jumping his moue from tab to tab max please take your meds
[4:50:58] sector_warlock: all they had to do was make it a very rare drop and remove the orange color and then its the same as getting a gavel or whatever the SoD sword was called
[4:50:59] fleks27: classic is doomed
[4:51:03] Teddsan: they care so much about tier list in sod tho
[4:51:08] FerdaJets: they care and complain so much about only having top dps classes for the easiest raids lol
[4:51:09] minimi12001: good fuck classic
[4:51:17] Joneim: People are furious over random dps tier lists in SOD already
[4:51:17] iamthegodcomplex: @fleks27 lol
[4:51:19] hi_im_Xenn: you mean classic or vanilla, people sucked in vanilla thats why no one knew about tier lists
[4:51:21] TJKlaenn: People and gaming have changed.
[4:51:24] Theliahh: gamers Madge
[4:51:26] Joneim: People are coping whenever something gets nerfed by 5%
[4:51:27] BabyDunn: palworld tier list when @Maximum
[4:51:30] greatangelsanguinius: people cared about thunderfury and stacked fury warriors even in vanilla i raided there lol
[4:51:32] lol_kronuss: SoD is literally just vanilla with retail abilities added lol
[4:51:32] TheItalianStallion321: 20 years ago was there no balance you played 1 spec and that was it.
[4:51:44] YugeCrit: yea but people care cause it feels bad being on the bottom of meters etc
[4:51:50] TJKlaenn: I had that with D4.
[4:51:51] MVPBuster: MVPBuster subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[4:51:52] ohfoeshow: if the game has evolved past legendaries then stop making and calling them legendaries
[4:51:52] huntermain123: thats me Gladge
[4:51:58] fleks27: i picked sorc for fun first D4 season
[4:52:01] fleks27: instant sad
[4:52:04] Theliahh: picking the meta college degree
[4:52:07] procotwitch: "bachelor degree tier list" KEKW
[4:52:15] justdubz_: @fleks27 same
[4:52:21] codydoubleu: Sadge non-meta career
[4:52:26] hi_im_Xenn: FF14 making it difficult/bannable to log/dps meter shit is so based
[4:52:26] SillySmiffy: I am playing chain lightning in Last Epoch and it isn't even a build on maxroll. Loving it just figuring things out
[4:52:29] Shifter2k: Its why I play frost, fuck tier list I have so much fun on it
[4:52:31] dango0n: what did you do in IT?
[4:52:31] minimi12001: and significantly poorer
[4:52:31] TJKlaenn: Teach me, Max. BLUBBERS
[4:52:35] Mugiino: I never looked at tier lists playing baldur's gate, so there are exceptions
[4:52:43] OXDOX: true
[4:52:51] Xastin3: f tier pay. = teacher
[4:52:52] dango0n: currently a Jr. net admin and pay isnt that great
[4:52:52] Azkrust: I switched majors and picked a degree that required 0 public speaking courses. Fack anxiety
[4:52:55] AtosL: Max be like Tier list of quadratic equations
[4:52:55] Deyoe: I'm a music teacher tempted by going to school for IT, you don't want to be in schools right now dude lol
[4:52:56] justdubz_: is MDI over?
[4:52:57] ctg_dreamz: @Maximum Not true Max hunters always end up ass but we still play them
[4:53:01] amokionyanii: learning fire mage because feral is low tier and people say feral doesnt work for higher keys
[4:53:07] captainnetz: me running auto cannon over rail gun
[4:53:08] DatguyOrochi: @Mugiino single player vs multi
[4:53:19] MeisterChiefX: the class that you enjoyed in lost ark ended up being one of the best overall since release too
[4:53:20] fdb33: Classic is super unbalanced and thats kinda the point now
[4:53:20] testosteronald: its bcs youtube clickbait
[4:53:22] MissingCriticalKnowledge: There's a massive amount to be said for just being happy and not knowing.
[4:53:23] neverekt: @Maximum to be fair teaching is hella tedious nowadays if it was just teaching i would have more fellow teachers xd
[4:53:24] Mugiino: @DatguyOrochi Exactly
[4:53:29] greatangelsanguinius: dont enable tier lists to matter AS much, racials being a prime example of a design issue still not needing to be there
[4:53:29] Hierod: see im usually the opposite, i like to look at tier lists and then i choose the least strong and try to make it work. Its just annoying when you get gatekept
[4:53:33] SirHorner: but I'm not having as much fun not being top of the dmg meter :(
[4:53:33] ghostdog_xd: depends on what your goal with the game is, if you want to reach a high rating and play you  play a class you love but you cannot push high rating with that class then you're not having fun regardless
[4:53:39] Mythos24: But the saying "follow your heart and the money will follow" is a fallacy. That's why I chose engineering as a major.  I later learned to love the job.  I just had a certain quality of life goal so I had to compromise
[4:53:40] OsyrissTV: why play a class that never gets invited to m+, play the class that always gets invited to m+ kinda deal
[4:53:43] neverekt: it aint bad in that regard
[4:53:47] wobble_tv: even advertisements are using tier lists now lol
[4:54:11] DankWizard420: imagine taking a balance druid to m+ KEKBye
[4:54:14] SirHorner: also, yeah - can't get invited to M+ groups if not good class :/
[4:54:15] BadMicro: PepeLaugh  me as a ret main pre DF
[4:54:17] Xastin3: if your not i top 5=6 meta classes. your not getting invited
[4:54:18] Morayeden: Frost dk Sadge
[4:54:18] BabyDunn: year of the spear will always be meta in my heart

[4:54:49] TJKlaenn: Perfect balance is also often just boring.
[4:54:50] SirHorner: +20 keys are much more gated than +27 :D - +20 gamers care about spec tiers much more
[4:54:51] Xastin3: if hunter joins  a high key... i just leave key as ahea
[4:54:52] Outk_Ripper: I play UH Dk and I have never been invited to a key above 23, I have to just pug my own key
[4:54:52] Alpacamage: gamers cry too much lets be real. adapt/dont do specific content at X level or dont play
[4:54:52] Shifter2k: Frost mage example!
[4:55:00] boluqt: just give lust/brez to every single class and its solved
[4:55:01] Azkrust: Y’all just stop joining QT, Rag, Aztalon, & Nemesis pugs and life is good
[4:55:05] cuzdabs: so ff14?
[4:55:07] DankWizard420: yes, literally what mop was
[4:55:13] Xastin3: if a hunter joins a high key... i just leave the key
[4:55:14] nalikael: that's a terrible balancing philosophy
[4:55:16] Jirofanboy: plz just give healer priest and healer druid kick I beg
[4:55:17] SillySmiffy: FF classes are so boring
[4:55:24] BadMicro: NOPERS
[4:55:33] greatangelsanguinius: FF art style sucks shit
[4:55:34] testosteronald: hell no
[4:55:37] TJKlaenn: Perfect balance is honestly quite boring.
[4:55:38] CommonJD: I mean, balance is as good for M+ DPS as it's been, but they also have been tuning like once a month... they could do more if they hadn't moved on to war within already
[4:55:40] alex_a29: what do you think about having the low utility classes being insane on dps just to maybe giving them a chance to be invited?
[4:55:48] sector_warlock: agreed
[4:55:54] iffaca: @SillySmiffy nah man samurai is mad fun
[4:55:55] fdb33: Is it not also nice to go ok this season ths class is better let me try that now and swap
[4:55:58] DreadfuryDK: S2
[4:56:02] testosteronald: wow just feels so good to press abilities to me
[4:56:06] GrimFandango: Season 1 was wild
[4:56:08] TJKlaenn: We should give the balance designers some props sometimes.
[4:56:10] DreadfuryDK: S1 and S3 have excellent balance. S2 has some of the worst balance we've seen post-8.3
[4:56:11] misteronslaught: m+ is kinda doomed the way it is right now
[4:56:11] boluqt: s2 pre aug was godlike
[4:56:14] Jazrial: Or they could introduce a M+ soloque and people could experience that every spec can do the content below a certain level
[4:56:17] Xastin3: balance is good if you dont count defensives... class defensive balance is the worst its been
[4:56:19] Mikbt: how quick they react and rebalance it is important
[4:56:23] Harleybane: @testosteronald same, idc what i do, i just wanna hit stuff
[4:56:23] fdb33: as long as its not like only 4 classes but some options
[4:56:29] wowskyro: dont say it
[4:56:29] Voodoodippin: gamba later???
[4:56:32] wowskyro: i love vdh
[4:56:33] Benjg7: vdh has too many stops
[4:56:34] cekay27: double sigils should never have been a thing, its too strong
[4:56:39] zerossussy: ever prot pala isn't close to vdh
[4:56:39] reggiepowa: yeah they need shouldnt have 2 stacks of chains
[4:56:40] m_dep: should other tanks have more utility? or should vdh have less?
[4:56:41] GrimFandango: yeah, double sigils for VDH was a mistake. It's soooo fun though
[4:56:42] RandaIFire: protpala on tryan is viable
[4:56:43] quizzicalm: i played shadow at the beginning of the season cause i love it but i got burnt out on keys early cause of q sim and now its good again and i dont even feel like playing smoge
[4:56:47] Oorvik1: I mean, nix DH and you’ll immediately get Pally
[4:56:48] callmetedddd: nahhhh
[4:56:49] Dlaze001: I re rolled DH cause I felt bad for joining pugs without being a VDH
[4:56:52] Tidewell: druid tank flight form EZ
[4:56:52] Harken121: also prot pala, both are in a stupid spot
[4:56:56] reggiepowa: double sigil too much
[4:56:56] TimTimmyMcTim: yup you need to kill double sigils
[4:57:01] smashhammer: yeah double sigil is too strong
[4:57:01] zerossussy: vdh is the only playable tank in pugs especially
[4:57:04] Harken121: something has to be turbo broken not to play one of them
[4:57:11] meatballblastero: we've seen that not be true just last season
[4:57:12] RandaIFire: protpala on tryan is something u might play still because of how much defensive utility it provides
[4:57:18] ludafrank42: just make silence sigil and fear sigil 1 charge, the others can stay at 2 charges
[4:57:23] TJKlaenn: Good luck with that, Blizz. :C
[4:57:23] Xastin3: if m+ wasnt about 1 shots then sigils wouldnt be as strong
[4:57:23] gfkoe: isnt part of it their tier set though
[4:57:26] Dowson91: playing a DH then playing any other tank its insane what you can do solo as a dh
[4:57:27] lol_kronuss: just give more shit to other tanks, problem solved
[4:57:28] MasotaTV: just make the other tanks fun and powerful ez
[4:57:30] wobble_tv: give brew sigils GlitchCat
[4:57:31] zarvul: just clue the rest of the tanks in on the fun
[4:57:31] Benjg7: nope, I don’t play vdh so that spec needs to be taken out back
[4:57:36] jannekvarnc: should give other tanks more agency with mroe control and bring down silence sigil a bit
[4:57:38] Mammuna: no they just need to buff other tanks so they`re more insane LUL LUL
[4:57:41] BadMicro: @Maximum do you think dungeon variety is too low in M+? as a casual, it kinda bores me when we only get to choose from 8
[4:57:45] OsyrissTV: warrior needs something, idk what they need
[4:57:45] misteronslaught: the thing is tho...there's some insane group comp EVERY season for high end m+ and thats what is required to be invited to keys
[4:57:47] Dowson91: Feels like you have two whole classes worth of utility on dh
[4:57:47] RaD_762: maybe give more tanks a similar tool kit having that much control is so fun
[4:57:49] TJKlaenn: Rambling <3
[4:57:50] Ufrisk: yapping
[4:57:50] Raerdk: brewmaster aint feeling fun atm
[4:57:52] captainnetz: poker time
[4:57:53] wowskyro: what do you think about lust and bres? id prefer if everyone had access to it in instances especially m+
[4:57:53] DankWizard420: prot warrior modCheck
[4:57:53] Khelge: why do we have 4 tiers of raids in wow? makes mythic raiding irrelevant for most people because lfr nrm hc takes all the energy
[4:57:54] GrimFandango: Streaming
[4:57:56] TheunGaming: what specs are you hoping to see first on TWW alpha notes as far as reworks go
[4:57:56] Thizzn38: max what oil should i put in a 2006 mazda miata?
[4:57:57] kj01a: I hear what you're saying, give prot warrior a bunch of shouts that do the same thing as sigils
[4:58:00] khebul: Make CC matter less. Giga pulls = more fun
[4:58:04] Xastin3: they need nerf all tanks so healers actually have reason to heal
[4:58:13] SillySmiffy: Your fun teir list from each patch update was neat imo.
[4:58:14] Tsaebahcus007: Frost dk, sv hunter, mm
[4:58:15] meatballblastero: ele :)
[4:58:17] diggerman111: warrior + hunter class tree
[4:58:19] TJKlaenn: WW.
[4:58:21] MisterNioce: @Maximum You been doing any keys at all? Or hoped off that train for a bit?
[4:58:25] MeisterChiefX: aug, mm, ele
[4:58:25] Zozohnet: the 2 shaman problematic ones
[4:58:27] fleks27: lock/dk i feel like have hated their gameplay for years
[4:58:27] gfkoe: i wish we had more of the hero talents
[4:58:27] Benjg7: dk warrior monk
[4:58:29] sardow90: all warrior specs
[4:58:33] holmat: Windwalker never been good
[4:58:34] fleks27: would be surprised if they dont get good stuff
[4:58:34] Mammuna: @Thizzn38 LUL
[4:58:35] OsyrissTV: it's kinda wild, but Preservation already needs a rework LUL
[4:58:36] big_hero_d: we need new tank ASAP and define some tank metric to actually make this role more exciting to play
[4:58:37] Xastin3: all dk specs
[4:58:37] Tsaebahcus007: affliction Sadge
[4:58:37] Xevenna: prevoker
[4:58:41] Azkrust: @thizzn38 canola oil
[4:58:42] Xastin3: affliction
[4:58:42] neverekt: @Maximum is young dip still hitting that skip? Update?
[4:58:44] sorliee: WARRIRO
[4:58:47] Dowson91: warlock class tree is giga ass
[4:58:49] Zaisx: shadow priest will somehow get their 10th rework
[4:58:50] OXDOX: wow head
[4:58:54] logic__: WW rework when?
[4:58:54] MisterNioce: entirety of shaman
[4:58:58] LonelyCheeyto: resto shaman needs an overhaul on concepts and playstyle
[4:58:59] Havocados: atal dazar
[4:59:02] AsSaC93: i agree on warrior big time and also dk and monk
[4:59:06] Xevenna: pres not viable in bigger keys
[4:59:06] jandemain: monk class tree is criminal
[4:59:10] lol_kronuss: unholy dk spec tree is absolute dogwater
[4:59:12] Archmage_Michael: MM hunter complete rework
[4:59:14] SlowboLaggins: warrior needs a lust banner/shout, gives us a lust tank too
[4:59:20] Veszyx_: BDK is so good, wdym.
[4:59:20] dango0n: eh. unholy feels a little bloated @Maximum
[4:59:25] Archmage_Michael: Delete Trick Shots
[4:59:28] Tsaebahcus007: ye s3 makes havoc way more enjoyable
[4:59:35] gfkoe: outlaw 4set needs to be baseline
[4:59:38] dustin_handsupdb: Unholy ST is mind numbing outside of lining up CD's and AoE is in the same place Breath is.
[4:59:43] GrimFandango: Blood needs complexity. It's too straight forward, and the only spec talents you change are like 2 in each tree for M+ vs Raaid
[4:59:49] cekay27: remove fel barrage and add the tier set in it's place
[5:00:00] Mazmerized: Shadow priest bfa version was unable to be balanced and they reworked it 4 times since to end up with psychic link which is just the same, either too good or feel useless
[5:00:04] IamBadSry: @Archmage_Michael  Prayge
[5:00:05] fdb33: The hunt DR is like core gameplay now
[5:00:12] OakProudArt: getting one extra Hunt on fyrakk p1 feels so fucking good
[5:00:13] Xastin3: druid class tree neeeds reworks
[5:00:13] Morayeden: All three dk trees need god
[5:00:13] UsedRuggs: Rework UH DK and BDK
[5:00:14] dustin_handsupdb: Breath Fix: Consuming KM procs reduces cooldown on BoS by 1s.
[5:00:18] Xastin3: druid class tree is trash
[5:00:25] shotzzxoxo: druid class tree is garbo
[5:00:35] shotzzxoxo: not touched since beta
[5:00:35] Bromgarr: Warrior tree has to be look at sometime soon
[5:00:37] enappl3: shaman
[5:00:37] ArchausDEKAY: WW??
[5:00:39] Voodoodippin: Amen
[5:00:39] dustin_handsupdb: @UsedRuggs BDK is fiiine just make DnD a bit less impactful and give us an external.
[5:00:39] UsedRuggs: @dustin_handsupdb thats actually pretty good idea
[5:00:40] Harleybane: am i the only one who feels the game needs to tone down on the speed of playing? feels like im playing tetris on 400% atm with everything thats going on
[5:00:44] someguyguyguy: monk class tree please god
[5:00:44] paragorr: BM feels real good
[5:00:45] TheunGaming: yeah spatial paradox is disgustingly good
[5:00:47] Xastin3: survival needs work
[5:00:47] Tidewell: hunter defensives need a rework
[5:00:50] khebul: devastation feels horrible to play tbh - too few buttons and they dont mesh well
[5:00:51] TJKlaenn: I just want Pack Leader Hero tree to be fun for BM.
[5:00:52] TheLuo: leech owl NEEDS to be raid wide
[5:00:53] SlowboLaggins: @Bromgarr shockwave being a capstone talent is a war crime
[5:00:53] Archmage_Michael: Druid got so many reworks. class that got the most attention (besides mages of course )
[5:00:54] ArVee: surv spec tree v boring
[5:00:55] OsyrissTV: @Maximum ayo, what about Pres getting Paradox
[5:00:56] TheLuo: or needs to be 15%
[5:00:56] itsrhinobruh: warrior desperate
[5:01:09] MeisterChiefX: MM is definitely not good gameplay wise and SV tree needs more stuff in it
[5:01:12] Voodoodippin: Give guardian iron fur some Magic Resist. easy fix
[5:01:13] MofuLord: i hope they perserve the current feral druid set in the talent tree
[5:01:18] Xastin3: survival spec tree is very non flavorful and has no choice
[5:01:20] Theliahh: hunters mark is so funny
[5:01:22] dustin_handsupdb: @UsedRuggs Either that or make it just consume RP bar like Bonestorm but then be extended by consuming KM procs.
[5:01:25] TJKlaenn: xdd
[5:01:27] UsedRuggs: @dustin_handsupdb BDK lacks the ability to deal with initial dmg on many pulls, and group util.
[5:01:30] spampurge: BIG FUCKING FACTSX MAX
[5:01:33] DannyBoii614: put cauterize in the class tree madge
[5:01:34] MisterNioce: Mage neeeds a visual update imo
[5:01:34] minimi12001: as a mage yes this is true
[5:01:36] minimi12001: too many
[5:01:43] RandaIFire: bring back gale burst on tod
[5:01:44] logic__: WW needs so much love
[5:01:45] BabyDunn: hell frostfire brings even more defensive choices for them lol
[5:01:48] someguyguyguy: Tiger statue lol
[5:01:53] UsedRuggs: @dustin_handsupdb something like THIS tier sets bonus, but as a buff to the DK would sold quite a bit of BDK rounding up a big pull woes
[5:01:54] GrimFandango: ToD just needs to be deleted CAUGHT
[5:02:02] spampurge: FACTSSSSSSS PREACH BROTHER
[5:02:02] Bromgarr: @SlowboLaggins It's so weird looking at it , having spear next to shockwave is really a crime
[5:02:04] handcannon77: they need to forget mage exists for a while and put that effort into warrior and monk lul
[5:02:16] minimi12001: nobody plays monk tho so
[5:02:17] Windnecro: a lot of the tod talents feel like they wanted to go back to bfa version but just didnt pull the trigger
[5:02:17] testosteronald: please make fof not mandatory
[5:02:30] Harleybane: brewmaster tree even less logical than ww
[5:02:32] OXDOX: 50% larger bonedust brew is pretty pog talent
[5:02:38] p_aradan: been a while since i played last time, how is retribution paladin doing in these days?
[5:02:46] 1tapkingg: outlaw is soooo fun
[5:02:47] dustin_handsupdb: @UsedRuggs I'd be fine with that just to be worked in. Thought the current playstyle DURING a pull is great imo.
[5:02:49] Lothland: shaman class tree sucks
[5:02:49] meken: enhance absolutely fries
[5:02:49] Team_Spanky: Survival Hunter, Affliction Lock, WW Monk all very much need reworks..pissin
[5:02:50] gfkoe: @p_aradan its performance is reliant on a legendary
[5:02:52] fdb33: enhance tier bonus thouth is so nice
[5:02:53] cyapat1: enhance GIGACHAD
[5:02:53] Joneim: Enhance just needs some defensive help
[5:02:54] Turkeypitz: remove hunter mark as an ability - add it to kill shot or similar sub 30%?
[5:02:55] nurkurzhier: shit missed, his points on frost DK
[5:02:57] sector_warlock: shaman is so down bad on defensives in general
[5:02:57] handcannon77: spriest tree could use some help with the structure(especially the top) tbh
[5:03:06] UsedRuggs: @dustin_handsupdb this is all from an M+ POV.. as far as raid I think most classes are fine.
[5:03:07] AgrM_Gengar: isnt holy priest still kind of weird?
[5:03:07] SlowboLaggins: @Bromgarr yeah especially when theres DH with chaos nova free
[5:03:11] arvantua: enh has no real cds tho
[5:03:17] handcannon77: enhance needs fuckign defensives
[5:03:18] kniftty: ele Sadge
[5:03:25] handcannon77: destros tree is dogass
[5:03:26] SheffyWoW: Sadge
[5:03:26] goesidd: Good disperse costing 2 spec points is crazy in 2024
[5:03:28] MVPBuster: Enhancement needs a real defensive that's not ele lmao
[5:03:36] iridae: Ele forgotten as always Sadge
[5:03:36] Tidewell: WideTHD
[5:03:39] LordFFlink: do we get an enhancment shaman support heroclass pls!
[5:03:40] meatballblastero: unless you're ele and they forgot to bake the power in Sadge
[5:03:55] WolfgangAmpersand: Shockwave should be replaced by Banner in SL
[5:03:55] enappl3: ele down so bad
[5:03:56] UsedRuggs: @dustin_handsupdb ya once a BDK gets rolling its fine, its keeping them from getting KOS as you try to round up mobs.. oh and give BDK an AOE RP spender
[5:04:06] reaperscarl: like monks statues
[5:04:08] Morayeden: So verdict talent trees need major work
[5:04:13] nurkurzhier: damn missed your point on Frost dk @Maximum
[5:04:14] theskot: rally is so sad now lol
[5:04:14] Harleybane: Hot take: melee shouldnt have a ground targeted effect, ever
[5:04:18] handcannon77: warrior has A LOT of issues. Class tree sucks ass, arms tree is very bad(lose giga ST to go aoe) and the class as awhole has awful utility
[5:04:23] xkillergod: time for the card game ?
[5:04:28] Raerdk: @Maximum what was your take on brewmaster
[5:04:33] grimbal1652: shaman needs ALOT of love. mostly eles dmg profile
[5:04:34] AtosL: What about giving other Tanks DH like CC instead of nerfing DH?
[5:04:36] minimi12001: motw/stam  buff combo is so cracked
[5:04:36] praysten: resto shaman gives as good a health bump as fort
[5:04:37] theskot: motw is the big one ofc
[5:04:39] Xastin3: it matters in dungeons... if you dont bring buffs in dungeons then i dont want you
[5:04:40] TroyStory__: They bring lust at least
[5:04:40] Tsaebahcus007: if u stack the right raid buffs in m+ its like a 10% overall dmg inc
[5:04:41] TJKlaenn: As a streamer I watch says, is it time for Balatro Balling?
[5:04:42] YaBoySquints: honestly they need to try and make every dps spec feel like the enh tree. Enh does need more defense honestly just armor or something we wear freaking mail. But the class tree is just top tier.
[5:04:42] SlowboLaggins: @handcannon77 yeah the utility for dungeons is awful, the damage doesnt really make up for it either
[5:04:43] Tsaebahcus007: offensively
[5:04:44] cyapat1: mage?
[5:04:48] meatballblastero: I literally dont care about a raid buff at all I just want a spec back that isnt spamming one button endlessly while also being weak as ass
[5:04:50] Raerdk: fair
[5:04:51] fizzis_: just got here but dks need help
[5:04:51] MisterNioce: BUTTON BLOAT
[5:04:54] TheLuo: @Maximum - if someone had to justify the reason for design choices in these trees do you think there would be a central theme or goal they're all going for? Or are all of these trees probably built in a silo?
[5:05:02] guynormally: brew is fine, just needs more control
[5:05:02] kj01a: Class reworks on the next poddyc episode?
[5:05:02] harris01_: @Maximum Your take on warlock trees?
[5:05:04] Defyin: make it up we won't be able to tell the difference
[5:05:18] iffaca: What I don't like about ele is that insta-casts do all the damage so casting anything feels awful
[5:05:19] punkyeti: button bloat, not enough hp, there you go
[5:05:23] Bromgarr: @SlowboLaggins We had that leap talent that gripped enemies with a chain that they removed in beta and never got a replacement
[5:05:26] McPunk: Max im sure you answered this a lot but why doesnt Liquid do MDI?
[5:05:27] RealSyloz: BDK needs Gorefiend's in a better spot in the tree
[5:05:28] wobble_tv: brew super fun but dh/pal is so much better in higher keys
[5:05:36] Harleybane: @Maximum did you increase the gain on your mic recently? sounds reeeeeally sensitive atm
[5:05:40] AtosL: Hey Max, why not buff tanks instead of nerfing DH cc?
[5:05:44] im_Bucks: @Maximum  do you think havoc is in a good place even though only one build is ever played
[5:05:45] reaperscarl: @Maximum do you think the monk's statues will ever be reworked?
[5:05:49] fatmany0: @Maximum what was your take on windwalker specifically this patch
[5:05:52] handcannon77: @SlowboLaggins the damage isnt even great, but yea the utility is insanely bad. I cant even get invited to 26s in LFG as arms, even though I have some of those keys timed on 28/29 because utility is that bad
[5:05:55] farfromaverage_: @maximum opinion on capped and uncapped damage?
[5:06:01] Veszyx_: Except for Monk's tier before they changed it.
[5:06:04] Veszyx_: Them Ebon Toes.
[5:06:08] dustin_handsupdb: @UsedRuggs Make Blood cost RP instead of charges and cause flare ups of your current Blood Plagues Epidemic style, that does more damage but a less healing than DS so it's a cost decision.
[5:06:09] Ok_Kingston: havocv shouldnt have been nerfed
[5:06:14] UsedRuggs: @AtosL How to do you buff any tank to compete with 30s of aoe silence, and 4 stops in any given pack?
[5:06:15] jerkmcgee: game is more about spec variety than variety within a sepc
[5:06:17] Tsaebahcus007: I kinda wish Eye beam was a bit stronger, for flavor
[5:06:17] Theliahh: there are a few builds
[5:06:20] zerossussy: havoc is defensively bad in high keys
[5:06:21] boluqt: @Ok_Kingston +
[5:06:21] BabyDunn: its actually pretty good on volc
[5:06:21] MVPBuster: You play the cycle build in PVP
[5:06:25] kevdeckie: low mover with VR and glaive tempest
[5:06:35] UsedRuggs: @dustin_handsupdb apply to Blizz as the DK Dev right now
[5:06:50] Theliahh: because zoom zoom is fun
[5:06:51] TroyStory__: For fun
[5:06:54] fizzis_: looks at hunters
[5:06:59] Marsbar006: KEKW BM Hunter
[5:07:05] handcannon77: how is that an issue lol
[5:07:09] handcannon77: thats ins anely nice
[5:07:11] IttsDany_: FG
[5:07:21] Theliahh: Theliahh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! cuz they repeatedly nerfed havoc aoe at the beginning of the patch PepeLaugh
[5:07:21] whatisthistwitchlol: What do you think of mage's dmg profiles tho, i get how nice fire mages are in high keys but for the average pugger doing up to 25s fm is super low dmg
[5:07:22] SlowboLaggins: @handcannon77 same here man but as fury lol, if i didnt have friends to run with itd be miserable
[5:07:36] Stimulated01: absolutly
[5:07:37] Archmage_Michael: same build for ST and AOE is gvreat
[5:07:41] Morayeden: Same build.
[5:07:43] FloatNg: id rather change like 2 talents and be goated all the time
[5:07:50] fizzis_: nerfing fel barrage wsa stupid
[5:07:53] Elliham: lol or you could play shadow priest and have to change ever dungeon
[5:07:53] Taedas: Same all the time to be good.
[5:07:56] fizzis_: shoulda been buffed tbh
[5:07:59] TJKlaenn: I wish I could summon 20 pets as BM Hunter. Sadge
[5:08:00] fdb33: Changing talents al the time is good if everyone has to do it
[5:08:02] Veszyx_: There's no correct answer. There's no one solution that will make everyone happy because it's just preference.
[5:08:04] doncrackle: @Maximum do you think dk will get a rework announced before war within alpha?
[5:08:06] aescend_: i like for there to be a couple different buttons for different content personally
[5:08:06] Yenlovrah: id love to have a choice of 1 or 2 points per gate to choose some maybe niche stuff
[5:08:07] handcannon77: well and DH has insanely good access to aoe/cleave, and a lot of it is burst aoe/cleave too while having good ST
[5:08:11] Stimulated01: not boring to be playing on a winning team
[5:08:12] Taedas: Honestly multiple builds that are good at both ST and AoE is best.
[5:08:15] Shad_WW: if the gameplay is good, i dont mind being the same always
[5:08:20] zerossussy: dk probably needs one
[5:08:22] Bloosah: I'd rather change depending on the situation, else, why the fuck do we have talent trees xD
[5:08:27] fizzis_: @doncrackle thats cope, the sanlayn goes hard on dnd
[5:08:31] Archmage_Michael: Do you think double sigil VDH will survive into next expac?
[5:08:37] ForgottenTime: but is it boring if you doing big dam Hmm
[5:08:38] nurkurzhier: I LOVE BREATH, but the DOWNSIDE is stupid
[5:08:39] doncrackle: @fizzis_ yes but it needs to be rebuilt
[5:08:42] whatisthistwitchlol: why is dk never included in the no raid buffs talk
[5:08:45] Suuraner: I Hope WW Monk gets a hot rework tbh they need it so fing Bad
[5:08:45] dustin_handsupdb: @Maximum Consuming KM procs reduces breath CD.
[5:08:50] fizzis_: obliteration is a noob trap though. it has the same downsides as breath and gets punished more
[5:08:51] Nickystr1x: i understand why people like breath but for me it's eh
[5:08:52] Drenwow: they need to rework arms tree hard
[5:08:54] Theliahh: make breath work like fel barrage or something
[5:08:58] Benjg7: dk hero tree as written has blood dk’s trying to avoid pressing death strike in our defensive
[5:08:58] GrimFandango: Breath needs an option node to have low CD so it can be played in dungeons
[5:08:59] Theliahh: 10 seconds of giga dam
[5:08:59] Tsaebahcus007: breath should be like fel barrage kinda
[5:09:01] panta_xdd: breath should be a toggle
[5:09:02] TroyStory__: Just rework breath a little bit to make it work
[5:09:03] handcannon77: I like slamming huge oblits, the 2-4t cleave niche just isnt working for it as a spec in raid/m+ tbh
[5:09:04] Benjg7: please save my spec
[5:09:04] dustin_handsupdb: @Maximum Consuming KM procs reduces breath CD. 󠀀
[5:09:09] aescend_: anger management for breath would slap
[5:09:09] mozerra: breath needs rework
[5:09:11] Kamehameshaw: just make it a damn cd with no resource consumption
[5:09:11] lol_kronuss: they desperately need to make breath viable in M+, just add a choice node that makes it more bursty with a 1 min cd instead of 2
[5:09:14] Harry_barry_larry: being out of breath bad NOTED
[5:09:14] RealSyloz: As a BDK main, playing VDH is a whole other world. Feels so much better
[5:09:18] codydoubleu: breath 1 minute CD and optimal uptime around 20 seconds would be sick
[5:09:19] Taedas: Why not just some breath is down buff?

[5:09:24] EppatTV: Or make it like Fel Barrage
[5:09:25] DreadfuryDK: Breath should work like Legion/BFA Voidform
[5:09:27] Oorvik1: I think they need to make obliterate fill in the gaps from breath. One example would be to make obliterate less punishing with downtime
[5:09:29] Mazmerized: they need to make it sorta work like a longer fel barrage
[5:09:29] big_hero_d: @Benjg7 AMZ Grip exists
[5:09:30] ForgottenTime: what if more classes had a ability like breath to make tanks want to pull like that
[5:09:32] exomaths: yea 100% uptime is kinda lame
[5:09:35] turtleulty: if they buff and change breath i will never play anything else again
[5:09:35] dustin_handsupdb: @Maximum Consuming KM procs or Rime reduces breath CD.
[5:09:42] NotScarfi: @DreadfuryDK yeah surrender to madness
[5:09:45] handcannon77: I mean just make it a 1 min CD, cap how long it can last and take some power out of it, and then put that power into other aspects of the kit/new talents
[5:09:50] Voodoodippin: why not give it charges like druid  mushrooms or full moon
[5:09:50] LonelyCheeyto: like what they tried to do with fel barrage kinda?
[5:09:50] fleks27: my record is lasting around 12 seconds (i never played dk)
[5:09:56] nurkurzhier: @Maximum SL3 breath was the best, loved  it
[5:09:56] jace193: @Maximum isn't that how Unholy plays with big undead minion spell? monstrosity or whatever its called?
[5:09:58] Drenwow: KEKW
[5:10:00] dustin_handsupdb: @Maximum Consuming KM procs or Rime reduces breath CD. 󠀀
[5:10:03] exomaths: @fleks27 HUH
[5:10:14] fizzis_: noooo delete frostscythe
[5:10:17] Oorvik1: same irl @fleks27
[5:10:17] captainnetz: Dk fans are just going through the same motions as shadow voidform and its going to end up the same because you guys didnt play shadow lol
[5:10:21] aescend_: nah not frostscythe DIESOFCRINGE
[5:10:32] fizzis_: its such an outdated ability
[5:10:32] DuckkiTV: When Frost Strike Crits it reduces breath by 0.5 secs or some shit
[5:10:37] Suuraner: What are your thoughts on the current state of WW Monk ? Can they be fixed without getting a "complete" rework? @maximum
[5:10:43] nurkurzhier: And Remove DnD, or change it. Cleaving in that shit is stupid @Maximum  in keys
[5:10:46] Drenwow: arms warrior deadge
[5:10:46] scrote_hammer: man:-bald 󠀀
[5:10:46] Szain3: DinoDance
[5:10:52] captainnetz: yall are gonna ask for the same thing we had in bfa and then complain when your cd isnt as meaningful in any fight where theres downtime
[5:10:53] dustin_handsupdb: man:-bald 󠀀
[5:10:59] handcannon77: WW is good rn
[5:11:01] LeoricDidNothingWrong: each target hit by scythe extends breath with 1 sec
