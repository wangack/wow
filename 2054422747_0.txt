[0:08:51] Mjawwww: too hard to get into
[0:08:57] Ventorpoe: its too hard and you cant blame anyone but yourself when you lose
[0:09:07] ItchY_val: Best rts game all time?
[0:09:21] Dehungerize: @misterworldhide you think anything over millennial is boomer?
[0:09:25] treavorthenusance: rts is not super accessible and are usually super in depth. your avg person is lookin to blast
[0:09:51] jess0x9: rts multiplayer just stresses me out altho i actually rly like the single player campaigns in them
[0:09:53] baseboned: tbh I love playing throught the campaign of StarCraft but the ladder scares me
[0:10:03] daevyfan: @misterworldhide boomers dont have 300apm

[0:12:11] treavorthenusance: eh i mean fighting games can be pretty toxic lol
[0:12:20] Slapsstick: rts and fighting games are similar in that regard
[0:12:42] dknamey: yumy 1 heal pls
[0:12:44] yungbooma: you play those games and you probably dont end up playing with the same person ever again, they dgaf

[0:14:18] Convoyv8: Team games are way worse for toxicity in my experience
[0:14:22] baseboned: you have to try on all 50 characters
[0:14:28] treavorthenusance: these toxic people always blame supports
[0:14:44] TheHDS: its only really worth farming the love rocket on 1 character per day, first attempt is like 100x higher than all the others
[0:14:56] Grillyo: Shooting someone over a fighting game is however a very direct approach to things, at least they're not passive aggressive
[0:15:04] surpriseparty20: People who think fighting games are toxic haven't played League
[0:15:26] jess0x9: gl being transphobic and playing strive u gonna get run out

[0:32:25] surpriseparty20: Ashen hollow was a busted ability for paladin
[0:32:27] Slapsstick: I hope they bring back sinful brand at some point, just make it a hunt choice node or something
[0:32:29] Milano___: Popping wings during Ashen Hallow was so fun

[0:36:15] Mjawwww: hopeful is NA
[0:36:20] Tocketimer: donki
[0:36:22] Glueburn: why aren't preservation evokers being played in MDI? Seems like uncapped damage would be the highest out of the healers, and the priest utility is handled by the shadowpriests people are running
[0:36:34] WolfL1nk: are you gonna cast mdi again? SNIFFA
[0:36:41] jess0x9: Dire Wolves r NA in spirit

[0:39:31] captlonglegss: What about windwalker
[0:39:33] SkirsdagTv: @Emm_Zee The good old days
[0:39:36] Toointro: or at least some early things
[0:39:40] Razdruid: oh the dh is back

[0:39:41] baseboned: the only good spot for aug is the trash can
[0:39:43] JayPain: meta is gonna be mage shadow priest x x x
[0:39:43] xsetikx: i for whatever reason have such a hard time with fire mage
[0:39:47] natethenoob1234: money says after the tournaments we get s4 stuff
[0:39:48] numenusty: Who is on Dorki's team and where can I watch some time trials?
[0:40:04] Toointro: yeah it was MrGm with his tweet
[0:40:05] natethenoob1234: with alpha
[0:40:06] IAttackYou: wouldnt this comp look better with Growl
[0:40:09] othernewname: We don't even know what 10.2.6 is gonna be lol

[0:40:59] Clozaa: @yumytv thanks
[0:41:01] IAttackYou: why monk over druid
[0:41:06] IAttackYou: asunaqThink
[0:41:09] darthrako: @yumytv What would you think if Blizzard gave Boomyweaving more damage for Resto Druid? I get that cat weaving is much more difficult, but the damage ain't even close.
[0:41:15] JayPain: feel lige pres evoker shuold be the healer equlivant of vdh
[0:41:15] Eltiima: in the MDI web it says feral
[0:41:33] daevyfan: feral has more single target
[0:41:34] xsetikx: feral is more up front dmg than boomie i think
[0:41:36] Slapsstick: so what if, hes resto at the beginning pulls, then switches while the others are going through the gauntlet
[0:41:40] Eltiima: o i didnt know that
[0:41:48] ash19045: but isnt feral better in lower keys because of the boomie ramp?
[0:42:02] bloodbane1738: Hey growl. I havent played any of Dragonflight and my friends want me to come tank M+ for them as a VDH.. anytips on how i can get prepped and ready to push high keys quick?
[0:42:04] zachl_: @darthrako in mass aoe theyre both around similar, the thing is that in boomkin form u can regrowth and dispell, so naturally imo it should do less damage than cat
[0:42:09] Emm_Zee: "Allegedly" Susge
[0:42:19] zachl_: in terms of rdruid strictly @darthrako
[0:42:19] Theliahh: Suske
[0:42:20] baseboned: that seems useless during time trials,
[0:42:21] The_Mail_Man__: zackl

[1:15:43] IAttackYou: which tank do you prefer to play with vdh or prot pal
[1:15:56] jenkinsdonuttv: Why do gamers find Everbloom so difficult?
[1:16:12] jenkinsdonuttv: Because it forces them to touch grass xdd
[1:16:18] Bjornsen95: Growl is a EB and Atal enjoyer
[1:16:27] jenkinsdonuttv: (That's me. I'm the gamer that needs to touch grass)
[1:16:43] jenkinsdonuttv: It's green and alive. It's grass xdd

[1:23:15] anaya909: afk'd 2min, came back and they were in everbloom

[1:26:41] anaya909: mdi practice or sleeping
[1:26:47] whiskeyhide: Yo
[1:28:25] anaya909: @Emm_Zee well we don't get the mana from blackout kicks anymore, but idk if they increased costs around that to force mana tea
[1:29:19] Emm_Zee: Maybe it's just my mw progging into harder content and having to burn mana more often
[1:30:08] anaya909: the recovery is just more active than passive now
[1:30:25] anaya909: but yeah if you have to vivify a lot it's rip mana

[1:42:14] flebbooo: Deadge
[1:42:55] IAttackYou: Deadge
[1:43:28] Troniin: am i crazy or does the fire aoe hit harder on the boss during fort weeks than tyran?
[1:44:04] TBouse: i think you are crazy
[1:44:06] TBouse: respectfully
[1:44:12] harmless52: could be both
[1:44:31] TBouse: your groups probably respect the boss more on tyran and press buttons
[1:45:10] IAttackYou: there are weird shit like that when its mobs from boss scaling with fortfied but i doubt fire ball is that
[1:45:13] codethename: It's so great when the tank pulls the boss, instantly 2 people die from cinders
[1:45:15] TBouse: rip dispersion
[1:46:14] Theliahh: @IAttackYou sanguine depths 3rd boss was scaling wrong for like 3 seasons, it goes unfixed for a long time sometimes
[1:47:17] IAttackYou: true Naruhodo
[1:47:38] yungbooma: why is your team doing aug buffed damage without an aug
[1:47:54] IAttackYou: they have button pressers
[1:48:06] Theliahh: nah it's just everbloom
[1:48:08] TBouse: this timer is extremely tight lol
[1:48:08] Theliahh: numbers are fake
[1:48:23] yungbooma: as it should be in a 29 everbloom
[1:48:27] IAttackYou: i thought you keep saying gg xdd
[1:48:30] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd
[1:48:56] tozewow: stupid boss
[1:49:08] TBouse: that sucks, lost like 15 seconds from dh death
[1:49:42] epilepticunicorn_: Sadge
[1:49:43] yungbooma: DONT LOSE HOPE
[1:49:50] Adrang: just pump
[1:49:54] Maximum: i dont know what has to happen to keys next expansion
[1:50:05] Maximum: but anytime you are fighting any single pull for 6+ minutes
[1:50:09] Maximum: that is bad and can never happen
[1:50:16] Slapsstick: @Maximum yo
[1:50:32] TBouse: "sent from vision pro"
[1:50:35] IAttackYou: bosses are so fucking weird
[1:50:50] yungbooma: @Maximum cap keys to level 25 easy fix Chatting
[1:51:04] yungbooma: MiniK
[1:51:12] mianerten: @Maximum i play m+ for massive pulls, intricate routing etc. bosses/pulls that take, like you said, over 6 mins, are retarded. Makes m+ boring at that point
[1:52:09] IAttackYou: im glad max is here ayayaxdd
[1:52:16] zachl_: @Maximum my team made me heal a 8 minute iridickron on 28 thoughts?
[1:52:34] mianerten: 8 minutes? wtf? did u have to 4 man it?
[1:52:36] Ill00: i dont even understand your complain, these are the hardest keys so it takes longer than an average 27 key?
[1:52:36] epilepticunicorn_: @zachl_ sounds like soo much fun
[1:52:47] codethename: imagine having fun as a healer
[1:52:56] pinkqy: @Maximum remove tyran and fort and replace it with alternating between awakened and encrypted.  The only have 1 other affix regardless of key level.
[1:53:04] TBouse: this add is a live lord
[1:53:06] zachl_: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/TyFNmcAC4wBt2MLV#fight=7&type=summary&pull=12
[1:53:13] zachl_: our teams 8 minute iridickron
[1:53:33] baseboned: lksjfdha
[1:53:36] TBouse: timer is like 30-45 over
[1:53:37] baseboned: omg that hit hard
[1:53:39] roguerhino: brother that is so annoying i am sory
[1:53:42] Ill00: @pinkqy and what changes then? people would do maybe 37 and still have high hp, it dont change anything to the hp scale
[1:53:59] yungbooma: @zachl_ you play with aug u deserve that long of a fight OMEGALUL
[1:54:03] Adzie: man prot pal really shines on tyran
[1:54:22] Maximum: lmao bro
[1:54:23] zachl_: @zachl_ there are logs of the same comp doing 6:30 :)
[1:54:26] Maximum: they pulled this boss with 6 minutes left
[1:54:28] pinkqy: @Ill00 HUH removing tyran and fort would mitigate that to some degree
[1:54:30] Maximum: they have 1 minute on the timer
[1:54:31] eternalsmile: Checking noobadin's POV from yesterday's keys - this guy sits with 3/4 Sludgefist's head
[1:54:35] Maximum: and its at 25% health
[1:54:37] eternalsmile: Help this man clear quest log
[1:54:45] Adzie: ez deplete gg
[1:54:49] yungbooma: @zachl_ cooldowns the same aswell?
[1:54:54] TBouse: yeah this boss is like 6:15 minimum on 29 tyran lol
[1:54:58] Ill00: @pinkqy how? it would only enable higher keys, and some points you still at a point where mobs would have high hp
[1:55:03] codethename: Y-y-y-y-yaaalnu, it's time to d-d-d-d-d-dueeel
[1:55:03] IAttackYou: puh
[1:55:07] Theliahh: o7
[1:55:10] Theliahh: you done good son
[1:55:12] roguerhino: o7
[1:55:15] BigBlazingBull: o7
[1:55:16] Adzie: o&
[1:55:18] zachl_: @zachl_ yep ! they made me heal a 1 minute long earth phase : )))
[1:55:22] yungbooma: good attempt o7
[1:55:25] MierkaBlue: <3
[1:55:26] mikeybro93: o7
[1:55:29] epilepticunicorn_: dmg to adds should just go to boss
[1:55:29] MierkaBlue: o7
[1:55:32] HolmesRN: o7
[1:55:37] pinkqy: @Ill00 its infinite scaling content like there's no solution to that problem unless its just not scaling anymore
[1:55:39] IAttackYou: o7
[1:55:46] codethename: @zachl_ Yeh know how you feel, just healed a +8 atal as disc. was brutal
[1:55:47] yungbooma: @zachl_ Deadge im sorry to hear that
[1:56:16] Ill00: @pinkqy yep thats my point, so removing any affixes wouldnt help unless they cap hp but what could be the difficulty then
[1:56:20] TBouse: 6:50 boss lmfao. but there were a couple deaths
[1:56:29] baseboned: 1 minute
[1:56:37] pinkqy: @Ill00 yea, but at least it would not suck as much.  Fort and tyran are boring ass affixes
[1:56:45] DizzySylv: @pinkqy theres always a handful of bosses that take 6 minutes long compared to everything else. its not a scaling issue, its that boss having alot of health being the "mehcanic"
[1:57:05] Adzie: the mechanic being add hp scaling
[1:57:07] Valanya11: wideNessie egg nogg wideNessie
[1:57:25] roguerhino: wideNessie
[1:57:31] mikeybro93: wideNessie egg nogg wideNessie
[1:57:39] Valanya11: Sadge looks like Zerg is Bedge
[1:57:44] TBouse: pretzul just needs to look up a log of a 29 tyran from a mage
[1:57:58] Emm_Zee: @pinkqy The extreme majority of these bosses take long because they spawn an add/shield on a timer, with each level it takes longer to kill it which means the time you can hit the boss gets shorter
[1:58:26] kingzera_: !ui

[1:59:01] Ill00: @Emm_Zee ye but it can be countered by more output until you reach a cap skill and gear wise, like people hitting 30-31 keys now
[1:59:17] Valanya11: I tried to get us classic content Sadge
[1:59:40] epilepticunicorn_: its ok val, i tried to get us SoD content. that didnt work either
[2:00:18] xSavageALx: you enjoying mist weaver over Druid?
[2:00:18] jessbad: hi how go key
[2:00:21] gevoratz: Hey you playing mdi?
[2:00:28] Ill00: @Emm_Zee game is already very difficult, you need alot of coordination, so you cant asdd more mechanics, so the only "solution" are bosses which have adds and shit to...what else can you do
[2:00:36] Icyhotts: ZERG!!
[2:00:52] Valanya11: YES
[2:00:53] heloraeon: what about great push?
[2:01:03] twitchsonic7: wouldnt be fair to have the best mistweaver in the mdi
[2:01:07] Icyhotts: bro we need you for just 4 horse sapp kt its great content!
[2:01:11] Theliahh: you're the only one who can beat echo
[2:01:12] gevoratz: Are you stop playing with dorki for some reason or ?
[2:01:13] Theliahh: historically
[2:01:22] Emm_Zee: @Ill00 You can definitely design adds and shields in a way where they don't get disproportionately longer with each key level
[2:01:28] tozewow: can you explain zaelia feral Druid in trials for mdi?
[2:01:57] HolmesRN: @gevoratz Dorki's team is training for MDI
[2:02:08] four_tyy: Are you and dorki not in the same team?
[2:02:25] gevoratz: Yeah I know but I haven't seen them playing a lot those season
[2:02:31] gevoratz: This*
[2:02:33] tozewow: can he do actual hps with it?
[2:02:48] epilepticunicorn_: hes not healing
[2:02:52] epilepticunicorn_: no one is healing that key
[2:03:10] Ill00: "if you well organized"
[2:03:15] darthrako: ^^^
[2:03:25] SlothraTV: just started playing again recnetly, and just gotta say youre a legend
[2:03:27] epilepticunicorn_: and they have immortal dps classes that dont need healing
[2:03:28] roguerhino: thats why pugs struggle past 20
[2:03:36] Maximum: the 4th class def needed to do a little off healing every group had aug ret or feral all of which do that
[2:03:41] Maximum: but ya its a 23
[2:03:56] SlothraTV: i listen to titan forge pod while im at work, and the ep you were on was AMAZING
[2:04:26] Maximum: dorki said it was a major consideration for the 4th dps spot. Like I dont think you're doing that key consistantly with like a rogue in that spot for example
[2:04:37] epilepticunicorn_: destro lock can single dispell as well
[2:05:13] njokkio: The dragon pulls seem scary with no healer, but on 23 tyrann i guess they just die
[2:05:21] Maximum: cat form dps is insane
[2:06:19] roguerhino: it mightve been the most vialble  with druid since they can off heal and stealth to start RP
[2:06:30] roguerhino: instead of takin a rogue
[2:06:57] SlothraTV: just lvled my shaman to 70 today, scared to try mythics with a healer tho, never tried it
[2:07:11] Nightbot: 🔔 Subscribe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yumytv and follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/yumytv 🐦
[2:07:11] MierkaBlue: yeah, zaelia also likes doing jobs for the team so might be the stealth and starting rp etc were valid reasons
[2:07:31] tozewow: ty max and @yumytv for explanation
[2:07:39] njokkio: @slothratv just go for it and if things go sideways blame the dps for not using defensives
[2:07:56] jersynessss: Nice to see you again on the monk!
[2:08:04] SlothraTV: @njokkio never thought of that, smart!
[2:08:16] YuzukiKaze: plink
[2:08:30] Kurrandor: guys i started doing higher keys since SL S4 because of growl - is it normal to hit a huge wall around 25-26 rn? with pugs as meta tank - am i in the clear or a slow learner? :D
[2:08:38] Kurrandor: just a quick sanity check
[2:08:57] ColdBrewSnob: are we god comp again should i gear up a priest
[2:08:59] SlothraTV: are the abilities he has on his bar all he uses? my bars seem so cluttered maybe i need to take stuff off
[2:09:12] SlothraTV: i have like 3 full bars of abilities
[2:09:28] codethename: @Kurrandor Dno, in the same boat with mostly 25-26s, couple of 27s. Hard to co-ordinate stops etc in pugs
[2:09:41] epilepticunicorn_: 25-26s are pretty high for pugs. if you arent running with a consistent grp you might find it harder to keep progressing
[2:09:43] hailfastcore: you can see the action bars at the bottom that are both full, they’re just almost invisible @slothratv
[2:09:51] hailfastcore: the centred WA is just the important stuff
[2:10:03] SlothraTV: OHHH
[2:10:03] njokkio: @slothratv that seems about right, rsham has a lot of situational buttons
[2:10:05] SlothraTV: i see it now
[2:10:28] hailfastcore: yeah the action bars are noticeable once you see them for the first time lol
[2:10:28] SlothraTV: im literally thinking about getting an mmo mouse just to have more buttons to easily click
[2:10:41] Kurrandor: @codethename okay so im not alone with this :D Man somehow the community makes it seem like 25-26 is rather easy and especially when i watch streams like yoda where he just pugs a 28 with no voice and times it?
[2:10:53] Kurrandor: @epilepticunicorn_ Thanks! thats the sanity check i need :D
[2:11:00] SlothraTV: my 3rd bar is ctrl + my buttons, and its hard for me to click
[2:11:36] SlothraTV: SlothraTV subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:11:58] SlothraTV: your content is amazing, man i appreciate you and your chat for helping me out
[2:12:11] njokkio: I don't have an mmo mouse, but mine does have 2 side buttons, and I bound one of them to ctrl for easier time using the ctrl modifier
[2:12:34] SlothraTV: @njokkio OMG thats the smartest thing i ever heard
[2:12:55] IAttackYou: you know there is uh for every letter
[2:12:56] SlothraTV: my side button is bound to an ability, but if i bind it to ctrl it opens up so many abilities
[2:13:02] cuzdabs: i do the same but have both shift and ctrl for the sides
[2:13:45] IAttackYou: like auh buh cuh duh euh fuh guh huh iuh juh kuh luh muh nuh ouh puh quh ruh suh tuh uuh vuh wuh xuh yuh zuh
[2:13:56] IAttackYou: we only have small subset
[2:14:03] IAttackYou: whats zach even doing
[2:14:27] SlothraTV: my main right now is a warlock, and i worked up to a 16 last week, feelin good
[2:15:15] YuzukiKaze: CHILLEN
[2:15:21] IAttackYou: @SlothraTV CLAP
[2:18:50] zachl_: @IAttackYou ?
[2:19:29] avenira_qt: nonverbal
[2:19:34] codethename: Stay verbal guys, keep it together
[2:19:42] darthrako: Never go non-verbal
[2:19:56] IAttackYou: how come we dont have every single variant of auh @zachl_
[2:20:02] DanteDemonZ: LMAOOOO

[2:21:46] ColdBrewSnob: i do like the last boss
[2:21:46] baseboned: deios isn't great, I like the morchie fight
[2:23:17] Chewbaccaw: how do you even tell whos the real morchie
[2:23:36] epilepticunicorn_: the hats
[2:23:59] codethename: Aight imma go bedge, finishing westworld. Started like 3 days ago on the last 2 eps of s4 KEKW
[2:24:36] wastedheals: brain has gone pretzel mode KEKW
[2:27:34] ColdBrewSnob: WeirdChamp not a team player
[2:28:01] kaosnblood: Does haste reduce gcds ?
[2:28:21] AvalenaTV: i'm physically unable to heal last boss rise on 28, the stupid 2nd orb during last phase when running always kills someone
[2:28:42] yctnm: a maximum limit of sorts HMM
[2:29:19] noldan216: for rise orbs, you don't have to stand in the whole time, only until debuff drops and group healthy enough to survive
[2:29:35] yctnm: its like 4 seconds from when the first one explodes
[2:29:38] Tidal96: @yctnm  TheIlluminati
[2:29:41] ColdBrewSnob: KEKW i dont think doing the mechanic is the issue
[2:29:51] ColdBrewSnob: on a 28
[2:31:02] AvalenaTV: on 28 the overlap of the ticking zone drops and the 2nd orb exploding 0-2s after the running starts always kills someone
[2:31:21] AvalenaTV: dunno how to fix that, feels like i need 2 charges of leaf at some point
[2:31:41] AvalenaTV: or risk it and cast 1 cast while running
[2:32:40] AvalenaTV: well i guess we'll see in a moment how its done haha
[2:33:41] AvalenaTV: show healing fren
[2:33:47] AvalenaTV: we wanna see them numbers
[2:34:03] yctnm: youre in rise not fall
[2:36:12] AvalenaTV: now the fun begins
[2:38:15] TheYeetusLord: ez key
[2:38:31] AvalenaTV: kk the move seems to be just to stuttercast while moving
[2:38:40] AvalenaTV: or maybe im just incompetent KEKW
[2:39:06] epilepticunicorn_: rip bye growl. he said he would fall asleep during the break
[2:39:36] kaosnblood: I cant decide if i must play 28% haste or 38%
[2:39:43] BearlyGamin: so I am using the !hack WA, but what is showing the castbar on the right side of screen?
[2:39:47] BearlyGamin: Do I just have to enable somehting

[2:40:27] BigTrout3: yo the switches for my keyboard arrived today. they feel very nice
[2:40:52] BearlyGamin: yeah I see the ! and hear the noise when being targeted, but would like to see the cast bars too
[2:42:17] epilepticunicorn_: pretty sure the WA is just for the sound. it doesnt give you the cast bars. but could be wrong
[2:42:50] BearlyGamin: yeah think so too
[2:42:59] BearlyGamin: so jw what growl is using for the cast bars
[2:43:05] AvalenaTV: @BearlyGamin i think its one of the dungeon weakaura sets that show the timer
