[0:52:41] treehealage1: then they release palworld 2 to pay for legal fees
[0:52:42] takhsick: usually big lawsuits take a sec to set up to
[0:52:46] Damitongo: nintendo is so troll
[0:52:46] FknLite: its not possible. they lost to temtem who copied way more than palworld did
[0:52:47] OG_Sparrow_: derivative content law bro.....no lawsuit
[0:52:48] Vahs_Redclaw: if they get sued they will get a lot of money for winning the lawsuit @Pikabooirl
[0:52:53] mpresz: how could they sue them? they arent pokemon they are pals XD

[0:55:17] OG_Sparrow_: i read the pokemon lawsuits were debunked and shut down
[0:55:17] takhsick: its filler game that everyone will forget shortly. a cash grab game
[0:55:20] VetisBR: isnt asmongold in some drama over that game
[0:55:24] heavensdemon420: it is a lot like Pokemon...people build shit and then go our and catch pokemon with a ball...it is borderline if not legit infringement on Pokemon
[0:55:26] OG_Sparrow_: pokemon has tried like 30 times already

[3:48:57] sgtstarfox: @gamer_dad_01 probably the smartest thing you could do especially with your little ones.  Its great discipline  and plus its something that you have in your back pocket if you ever need it.  boxing is cool and all but GL doing it wrapped up on the ground getting maul'd
[3:48:58] m1sterpoop: lol

[3:49:40] RyanScurvy: incline tread gets your whole body going
[3:49:55] fawthespriest: treadmill is alot harder than the bike
[3:49:59] bigtimeaiur: Stair stepper will get your rate in no time homie.
[3:50:14] RyanScurvy: swimming is bis in slot but not something most people want to do every day

[3:51:13] kwingas: doesnt build any muscle
[3:51:13] MrPickle_singaming: @Pikabooirl GGs i was the DH
