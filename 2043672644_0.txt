[0:52:42] takhsick: usually big lawsuits take a sec to set up to
[0:52:46] Damitongo: nintendo is so troll
[0:52:46] FknLite: its not possible. they lost to temtem who copied way more than palworld did
[0:52:47] OG_Sparrow_: derivative content law bro.....no lawsuit
[0:52:48] Vahs_Redclaw: if they get sued they will get a lot of money for winning the lawsuit @Pikabooirl
[0:52:53] mpresz: how could they sue them? they arent pokemon they are pals XD

[0:55:20] VetisBR: isnt asmongold in some drama over that game
[0:55:24] heavensdemon420: it is a lot like Pokemon...people build shit and then go our and catch pokemon with a ball...it is borderline if not legit infringement on Pokemon

[3:45:46] Voriq: my resting heart rate is 200 EZ
[3:45:46] middlebeach: 160 is too light unless you are 5'5 or shorter. Shoot for 200pounds plus

[3:46:43] Chaewon5: @emuland is this something that needs to be monitored
[3:46:43] TimmyShoes: prolly low lvl 2s
[3:46:45] fawthespriest: no higher than 150 on sprints

[3:48:07] richardspencer95: TRAINS CARDIO TO TAKE LARGER BONG RIPS- GOAT
[3:48:11] RyanScurvy: dynamic stretching means youre like doing movements to stretch, static stretching is stretching in the same position for like 30 seconds
[3:48:12] hemm__: kill for the thrill baby
[3:48:15] emuland: I was on the cardio wave last year and its lit
[3:48:19] ninatsuki_: @RyanScurvy ^^^
[3:48:20] CHMage: I do 3 days crossfit for cardio, 3 days hypertrophi focus @Pikabooirl
[3:48:20] takhsick: @ninatsuki_ omg omg its u
[3:48:22] fawthespriest: whats a sex life?
[3:48:24] emuland: helps you focus on improving ur game too
[3:48:26] richardspencer95: Some bed room cardio
[3:48:28] stuttersx: standing desk and treadmill
[3:48:29] kwingas: was about to say, what sex life lol
[3:48:32] ninatsuki_: @ninatsuki_ hi love<33
[3:48:32] arithmetical: My man's thirsty
[3:48:35] thisisthotcaller: sounds like a marathon jerking sesh on the cards
[3:48:44] TimmyShoes: pika you're a gladiator. in roman times they used to throw women at gladiators.
[3:48:45] Vultro: How do you like to meet women Pika?
[3:48:45] fawthespriest: lolool pikas just in the mirror with no kit on like him out of american psycho lol
[3:48:52] Vultro: Dating apps are kinda shit
[3:48:56] holyproxy32: Cardio is king
[3:48:56] ninatsuki_: @takhsick  ^^
[3:48:57] marcus__am: 12 incline 3.0 speed for 30 minutes on treadmill
[3:48:57] sgtstarfox: @gamer_dad_01 probably the smartest thing you could do especially with your little ones.  Its great discipline  and plus its something that you have in your back pocket if you ever need it.  boxing is cool and all but GL doing it wrapped up on the ground getting maul'd
[3:48:58] m1sterpoop: lol
[3:49:00] TimmyShoes: just go to the club and tell every girl you meet that you're a rank 1 gladiator. insta panty dropper
[3:49:09] Chaewon5: My english isnt great so i do apologize
[3:49:25] RyanScurvy: bike is probably the worst unless youre going hella intense
[3:49:28] Vultro: Stair master with a waited vest is awesome
[3:49:29] Alexmanzz: Assss gainsss
[3:49:29] Euforya: Treadmill is a different beast
[3:49:30] m1sterpoop: Bro the amount of rizz you would have in roman times would be off the charts
[3:49:34] Vultro: I did that for the firefighter exam
[3:49:35] Chaewon5: stairs with weight vest is just very hard
[3:49:39] Ryvv: I get so fucking bored on bikes.
[3:49:39] vyneron01: stairmaster is TOUGH
[3:49:40] RyanScurvy: incline tread gets your whole body going
[3:49:55] fawthespriest: treadmill is alot harder than the bike
[3:49:59] bigtimeaiur: Stair stepper will get your rate in no time homie.
[3:50:14] RyanScurvy: swimming is bis in slot but not something most people want to do every day
[3:50:22] fawthespriest: the cross trainer is good i find
[3:50:36] kaizen421: bis = best in slot
[3:50:41] MrPickle_singaming: that was tough pika
[3:50:42] Ryvv: Unless it's an air bike. That shit will fuck you up

[3:50:59] bigtimeaiur: Calves hard2
[3:51:02] emuland: stairmaster is incredibly difficult though
[3:51:03] sitosterolpvp: stairmaster is actuall called assmaster
[3:51:05] jTrillen: !build
[3:51:06] emuland: do a few weeks on bike
[3:51:06] kwingas: stairmaster doesn't tone anything
[3:51:09] notrhyslol: how come u dont play with a headset
[3:51:12] LoLOkanak: stairmaster fucked up your back and knees if you have it in your routine tbh
[3:51:13] kwingas: doesnt build any muscle
[3:51:13] MrPickle_singaming: @Pikabooirl GGs i was the DH
[3:51:14] bigtimeaiur: Bike is much less impact
[3:51:17] jTrillen: !armory
[3:51:18] Nightbot: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/tichondrius/Tmpikaboo
[3:51:18] nightballa: stair master will wear your ass out
[3:51:24] emuland: stairmaster is too hard until youve done a few weeks on bike id say
[3:51:27] arithmetical: Go swimming
[3:51:29] emuland: especially after a workout
[3:51:33] Ryvv: Yeah, as long as your heart rate raises, any cardio exercise will do
[3:51:34] sitosterolpvp: stairmaster 5 min is like 45 min bike i promise
