[7:01:33] Stord: wouldn't surprise me
[7:02:16] Brodoswagings: not even 50k smh
[7:02:51] Aptness: your proc rate could have just been dog too. top mages on the last boss are getting around 5% dmg done by it

[7:05:05] Conf1gs: is Questie what people use for SoD or is there something better?
[7:05:36] tipsym0nk: Until kick do us apart
[7:05:37] Aptness: @Conf1gs questie or rested XP guide. rested is much more step by step
[7:05:53] Paralyzor: aptness does restedxp go to 40?
[7:05:57] Paralyzor: mine stopped at 20
[7:06:05] Conf1gs: @Conf1gs ok so rested is better for someone that's newer I guess
[7:06:08] Aptness: @Paralyzor gotta pay for the full version of rested
[7:06:21] Paralyzor: aaaah fair. i already spent enough money to play this game
[7:06:24] tipsym0nk: Na bruh just havin issues with kick payment options.
[7:06:25] StreamElements: BRUH
[7:06:35] Aptness: ya I could never bring myself to pay for a leveling guide personally
[7:06:48] Paralyzor: maybe 10 years ago i would of lol
[7:06:59] Subo_ignorethispart: yoo new patch coming: Conjure Water (Rank 5) will now conjure a full stack of 20 with each cast (was 2).
[7:07:11] Stord: no way
[7:07:51] Subo_ignorethispart: latest wowhead post

[7:16:39] htown2799: worth for the charts
[7:16:56] jgd2w22: and you can say you tanked gnomer
[7:18:14] senlash: L
[7:18:19] htown2799: try reload ui maybe
[7:18:20] Yosamita: just reload ui and it will work
[7:18:24] Aptness: the good ol guess and check
[7:18:27] pineappleqq1: check now i think cuz u were in combat
[7:19:01] htown2799: that helm is insane
[7:19:10] jgd2w22: i assume they're bop
[7:19:20] Aptness: they're BoP
[7:19:25] htown2799: yeah bop
[7:22:10] Aptness: melee is still going to out range if they stand on that wall
[7:22:14] Aptness: they do not need to go that far
[7:22:17] Aptness: at all

[7:25:32] Aptness: pagman can solo the location, it will just jump to melee for the other 2
[7:25:50] Aptness: really only need 1 3 stack and a solo on the opposite to ensure melee stays safe
[7:26:17] jgd2w22: 16 hp. yikes
[7:27:42] OlalaPlaa: the irritated is different than the one you buy with the item
[7:27:57] OlalaPlaa: it is
[7:28:11] OlalaPlaa: you cant buy that irritated set
[7:28:30] OlalaPlaa: irritated is better for PVE i think, it gives -stamina
[7:29:36] Brodoswagings: do /loot and you can see easier
[7:29:41] Fame89: thats BiS caster
[7:29:45] htown2799: EZ
[7:30:58] Aptness: @Nidas make sure to replace your rune
[7:31:01] Aptness: in your chest
[7:31:23] Brodoswagings: that boots is only for lock tank i think
[7:32:11] Aptness: also big money making moves, dont need to craft the chest now EZ
[7:44:19] mawrgg: loving these chill wow streams! after some RP nice to watch.
[7:44:41] mawrgg: plus cool to see some more SoD tbh
[7:44:45] mawrgg: aint seen much on it
[7:45:05] Aptness: its a 20% loss on performance for me RLing
[7:45:07] Aptness: and not just playing

[8:10:15] Lallsi: is this their first gnomer or second?
[8:10:27] Lillucifer: second
[8:12:21] Subo_ignorethispart: there should be a thing on the ceiling that points where the next bombs will start spawning
[8:14:10] Aptness: did you hit the disable addon button earlier when the lua crashed
[8:14:13] Aptness: it could have been DBM
[8:14:39] Aptness: you may need to check addons and re-enable it on the list too
[8:15:37] Lillucifer: would have been so much easier with a ret paly ;) LUL
[8:27:38] Aptness: brez is a 30min CD
[8:27:40] Aptness: sadly

[8:41:29] thompaxd123: paladin
[8:41:32] thompaxd123: blessing of freedom
[8:41:45] thompaxd123: to remove raid stacks
[8:41:52] thompaxd123: for tank not to get oneshot
[8:42:52] Lallsi: are you sure raid stacks increase the damage? I think we just did bof on tank and didn't care about stacks on the rest
[8:43:22] yanusboy69: if you get enough stacks raidwide its instant wipe, that's why everybody should be using FAP
[8:43:31] Subo_ignorethispart: yes its raid stacks increase the dmg, not just the tank

[8:57:22] daradius: hello :)
[8:57:48] Lallsi: we also tanked at the entrance so there's more time and space to deal with the bombs
[9:06:53] DanPlaysChess: sheesh how many phases is this fight!?
[9:07:44] Lallsi: 4 phases
[9:08:37] DanPlaysChess: seems like a tough fight
[9:09:01] DanPlaysChess: i wonder if it's worth it to just have 5 ppl on bombs and cycle every time so you never have to call it out
[9:10:03] yalenv1: EZ
[9:10:23] Lallsi: the last phase doesn't seem that much of an issue since in order to get there you already have to nail the mechanics
