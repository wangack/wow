[0:40:09] 1angerman: don't think it should have to do with that it's the streamer that is getting griefed - but rather that Blizzard wouldn't want anyone in their game to sit and spawncamp someone for 20-50 times, regardless if they're a streamer or a normal player. but whether it does, no clue

[0:40:13] CptMorgan132: if you're killing someone in a pvp zone, its different than sniping in a random questing area
[0:40:14] SaneGrove: Its also the lvl disparity imo

[0:41:51] Cigar75: @Hykan Smadging
[0:41:52] hagengen: but imo the ban was still unecessary, just because its on stream or off stream is irrelevant, so you could maybe implement some anti harrasment tactic, but the ban was wrong imo
[0:41:52] Hykan: @randomcoolentity then roll on a pve server if you cant deal with it
[0:41:53] snooglets: 15 year old game and people don't understand pvp worlds still

[0:43:24] 1angerman: don't think it should have to do with that it's the streamer that is getting grief-ed - but rather that Blizzard wouldn't want anyone in their game to sit and spawn-camp someone for 20-50 times, regardless if they're a streamer or a normal player.  If the level 40 turned on his stream, would it no longer be okay & ban-worthy if you kept camping him? @sodapoppin

Alright, if you want me to remind you, I have damage dealt by thorns increased by 4 and duration increased by 50 percent - that's a 15 minute buff of a solid 33 nature damage. Not to mention also I've got the balance improved thorns speced increase damage by 75%. That shit will fucking pump. Good luck out-dpsing my buff. It's a godsend.

[5:04:02] Laaash: The problem is that since he opened for you, the boss with the key runs away, and hides deeper inside where u need the key, so you need to do it normal for the boss to stay infront of the chapel, or you need him to open the next gates
[5:04:04] Hagenus: xdd
[5:04:05] Lesdout: you can pull the dude with the key before he runs off
