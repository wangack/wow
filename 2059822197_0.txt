[0:33:23] ren0m: Did you try scrolling back?
[0:33:31] ren0m: A stupid question, but still

[0:39:00] reippailija: you got the country correct
[0:39:57] rick_0_: @ren0m No not on the FOV but my scroll works, if thats what you mean
[0:40:12] Nico_vdM: @rick_0_ camera field of view is not camera zoom.
[0:41:42] ren0m: The /console cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor 2.6 command should set the max distance. I have no idea why it's not working.
[0:42:17] ren0m: With it you should be able to scroll out to max distance. I thought you had scroll bound to something else, and that's why you couldn't use it.
[0:42:18] Oldjibatufei: try healer standing on the very edge of that platform and all other 4 at melee range? that stack in front of boss
[0:42:19] CrerisRs: if you did that it is at max distance, you also have FoV and also screen resolution(ultrawide monitors see a lot more shit)

[3:04:20] xdanielsooon: not 10% of the previous total
[3:04:59] CrerisRs: if it went from 330 to 340 we would be pushing like +100 right now
[3:05:06] TBouse: basically geometric vs arithmetic scaling
[3:05:38] GrimFandango: what was the key that gave you 3.8?

[3:05:53] reippailija: whose hole
[3:05:59] xdanielsooon: yes but that last key level is already an addition like if 25 is 300% for example, a 26 is not 330%
[3:06:12] GrimFandango: +31? Or just a better time for 1 IO?
[3:06:18] GrimFandango: hell yeah grats btw

[3:49:58] ste1164: everyone realised nerf was toxic
[3:50:00] macnch33se: why did they split? another argument??
[3:50:11] TBouse: i love how he said there's no drama, when it's obviously a drama thing
[3:50:28] TBouse: i wouldnt want to play with nerf either

[3:55:25] FLUFFALOBUFFALO: ive experienced this recently but i just cant stay up that late and still go to work the next day its just not healthy
[3:56:05] Snaaade: Would you have a easier time getting a group on NA? Or have you always played eu ?
[3:56:26] TBouse: squeaky wheel
[3:56:44] se_enginheiro: Gotta have blood in the eyes, being an awsome player is not enough
[3:57:04] se_enginheiro: The problem is there aint much younglins starting to play wow and be good
[3:57:18] Ayije: i think just a lot of eu players have their own social circles at the top end of keys
[3:57:59] se_enginheiro: Cause there's no "money" here, the amount of hours you have to spend to be good just go learn another game
[3:58:17] burne114: I think they all form teams in the special non-JB discord they all have
[3:58:23] burne114: Dorki talks about it all the time
[3:58:29] Ayije: ye it all happens in the one you are not in
[3:58:35] gordoflunk: they see you as a father figure and dont talk about their groups until you're gone
[3:59:10] Ayije: resto druid mdi is the worst possible scenario
[3:59:14] Ayije: pure suffering
[4:00:02] Ayije: i dont think i ever had less fun on a spec tbh
[4:00:35] TBouse: evoker 4th dps bailing out the non-resto druid healers
[4:01:11] TCancelYO: Hahaha :D
[4:01:57] Isomorph: i enjoy all the 3 meta healers atm, pretty fun healers this season
[4:02:08] Suka025: +29 waycrest there it is
[4:02:49] bl4ckbones: i hate disc rn it feels like a total turret
[4:02:50] se_enginheiro: Yep not even real football
[4:03:06] Mavarax: Monk so fun
[4:03:34] shamanticsx: Your 29 WM showed up
[4:04:08] MicHawkh: 500-700 smites cast in dungeon not my cup of tea
[4:04:15] bl4ckbones: yup
[4:04:35] TCancelYO: yea 2nd boss in fall as disc feels bad
[4:05:12] Ayije: the spec is designed around that tier bonus, it would be beyond awful without it
[4:05:19] Ayije: just 0 healing outside of bender
[4:06:40] TBouse: it seems high skill ceiling but crazy boring. so much smite spam
[4:07:13] vickmantwo: 76 raiders from vickmantwo have joined! 
[4:08:22] bl4ckbones: i wouldnt mind the cdr at all if there was any way to still get cdr outside of just smite
[4:08:42] bl4ckbones: nature swiftness would solve most things if u could just insta smite
[4:09:02] nixar1: what if smite could be cast while moving, would it be broken?
[4:10:35] FLUFFALOBUFFALO: mindblast needs to do more dmg
[4:10:38] gordoflunk: do you think mid-ranked guilds should just play holy b/c of the skill/execution requirements of disc
[4:10:40] Ayije: i think its a horrible design when a spec is that reliant on other people helping it
[4:11:15] bl4ckbones: But at the same time. when the tier is gone, disc gonna need another rework or its just gonna be so much worse
[4:13:07] Ayije: well it needs a complete rework imo
[4:13:23] Ayije: they removed half the spells while not fixing issues
[4:13:43] minimi12001: across whole platform while on a treadmill sucks so bad
[4:13:51] joffrey0101: such a scripted spec
[4:13:55] Ayije: the toolkit is so limited that one nerf will put the spec to the ground in m+ cause theres 0 skill expression
[4:14:04] Ayije: your penance either heals the dmg or people die
[4:14:36] TBouse: is Spatial Paradox taken for disc always?
[4:14:49] nohbahd: what is the best addon for plates? plater?
[4:15:44] joffrey0101: I stopped playing my disc and went back to rdruid when my smite finger started hurting, I understood it was a broken spec
[4:15:56] minimi12001: mage is so mobile its crazy
[4:16:04] minimi12001: ice floes 3 stacks 20 sec cd
[4:16:27] bl4ckbones: Void elf racial seemed useful for me however the fact its on gcd is also dog
[4:16:55] TBouse: dk?
[4:16:58] joffrey0101: agreed, it's slow af
[4:17:08] joffrey0101: even with all the feathers
[4:17:22] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:17:29] joffrey0101: one thing they could do is that penance always makes you ALWAYS move faster and not just when you cast it on you
[4:18:11] unemployed_degenerate: wheelchair class lol
[4:18:21] unemployed_degenerate: gotta get pushed around by your buds
[4:19:20] joffrey0101: yes could be nice, I think  this is the kind of spells that also helps differentiate good players from others
[4:19:20] bl4ckbones: ff14 mechanic meaning u cast faster than ur gcd leaving u small windows to move inbetween casts
[4:20:07] sw0ngs: you can cast pennance moving now right? better than nothing ahha
[4:20:10] Snaaade: Did you get banned from running around fountain in valdrakken ?

[4:37:56] JackBurton176: @jdotb sir you just have to put a fan outside his  room. that will drown out the noise

[4:51:32] Rottee: @sw0ngs you do though lol
[4:51:58] lanta404: any reason why 32 brh wouldnt be possible?
[4:52:00] 7zach: if you arent dpsing as a healer, you arent going past 20s lol
[4:52:05] sw0ngs: @Rottee what key is a make or break due to healer dps?
[4:52:28] xXFlow29Xx: you can 26 without dps easy
[4:52:31] Rottee: @sw0ngs no key but if you want to push keys you gotta dps
[4:53:32] KrissyWissy6: @7zach - if you‚Äôre failing a 20 bc lack of healer dps, you‚Äôve got bigger issues.
[4:53:55] 7zach: @KrissyWissy6 im talking about getting invited by ppl who know you lol
[4:53:57] KrissyWissy6: healer dps is largely dependent on performance of the other 4.

[5:18:13] happierfeet_: dps too low?
[5:18:19] max____09: rip

[5:22:38] MicHawkh: What happend to make such a timeloss? dps seems fine
[5:23:06] happierfeet_: dont get better just yell
[5:23:34] im_cromaa: hey Jb, coming back to DF since I didnt play since BfA, is healer dmg still hugely relevant for pushing keys?
[5:24:07] Zircons: it's not shadowlands s1 relevant
[5:24:24] trevorm5: brock purdy
[5:24:38] MicHawkh: tru and based yeller
[5:24:48] theBroHam: i did an 18 and a pug healer did 3k dps LOL
[5:25:24] goblingher: @theBroHam so +3?
[5:25:54] im_cromaa: Like Iam in ther range of 23-25 keys and sometimes if we dont time a key i feel like I couldve done more dmg and we couldve maybe time it
[5:26:05] theBroHam: We had good dps, so I think it was still a +2
[5:27:25] theBroHam: i gotta go do errands. have a good rest of the day!
[5:27:33] gordoflunk: in lower keys healing effectively does dps because bad players will panic at 50% and get distracted from doing dps even when there's no damage coming
[5:28:05] goblingher: @im_cromaa 99% tank route + dps not sending cd¬¥s
[5:28:22] im_cromaa: Thanks for your advice!
[5:30:17] Su1a: Hi can u show ur talents pls
[5:30:21] bugefps: !aura
[5:30:30] zeviika: if a dps must die, we must sacrifice them for our dps
[5:30:31] bugefps: !addons
[5:30:34] Su1a: ty <3
[5:31:45] gordoflunk: if your group does 700k dps w/o counting healer on a 3min fight then every 10k dps saves 2.5sec
[5:32:02] TCancelYO: What trinkets do you use in TOTT?

[5:39:33] shockwave922: because of the phial
[5:39:57] reippailija: you dont use vers phial?
[5:40:28] hisagi1997: hey legend, just wanna ask about this dungeon, do we have to heal high stacks of tank bleed or they're supposed to deal with it somehow
[5:41:42] CasualDev: dwarf pally, doesn't exist. Idk how dh deals with it
[5:41:58] MicHawkh: ALWAYS has been

[5:46:12] FinestGoldy: not sure if its just the groups i've gone with but i do not like running this dungeon
[5:47:00] Loovrro: How important is people standing in your efflorescence
[5:47:14] supzfly: one of my least liked as well. ran it 100s of times for trinkets (never dropped). ran fall 33 times to get my staff and still don't mind that one:D
[5:48:08] reippailija: i dont think i hate any dungeon this season
[5:48:27] Platinumttw: hate this healing debuff
[5:48:28] reippailija: wasnt like that in season 1 and 2

[5:57:12] Whitewolf1441: why does it say aoe when its really single target
[5:57:43] IcyBlueMiner: so for focused tempest you want to be really spread out right?
[6:01:21] devilhawk83: want to be in a square pattern so that the tank is the middle with the boss
[6:01:57] IcyBlueMiner: didnt know. thanks!
[6:03:22] TheTavan: The only way to deal with spiteful on yourself as Rdruid is to run away from it right @jdotb ?
[6:03:35] xXFlow29Xx: use vortex

[6:08:27] SAMBBA1: squid boi smacks really hard
[6:08:36] Whitewolf1441: jb pls, what if i want typhoon really really bad?
[6:08:58] wowskyro: for the minion casts do you think its efficient to to stop every other set of casts to give time to heal in between since not enough stops for all
[6:09:44] Whitewolf1441: gg
[6:09:44] wraghelm: I have started playing druid but sometimes find it clunky to try to get out of my forms. Any tips?
