[4:22:30] saund: You left Spergatory the best guild on living flame
[4:22:40] saund: :[
[4:23:58] iNSANEono: so u got 100g handouts and gambled it all away
[4:25:01] wowjumper: 25%
[4:25:22] blackarkiitek: encrusted item is 12g and both crafted items are 30g on lone wolf horde. Time to double my gold
[4:25:32] faaantan: your to late with that i did it 1 week ago when grime where at 3g
[4:26:08] faaantan: i mean yoiu knew when you did the dungoen
[4:26:19] PermaSmug: Bedge
[4:26:48] wowjumper: what are you selling
[4:27:30] kingjudethe1st: is this dogshit rogue 40 yet?
[4:27:42] PermaSmug: that's me :)
[4:28:01] SunTruth1: so its actually profit
[4:28:06] SunTruth1: that method?
[4:28:36] PermaSmug: a small loan of 10 million dollars
[4:28:38] magickharu: Simonize did the math on the Grime Encrusted Objects and it was 66s each and they auction for 44s each rn. Could be diff based on other AH prices tho
[4:29:08] magickharu: so 22s profit each. But I think there is a good bit of rng as well
[4:29:10] SunTruth1: i have like 210g but i only have lw at 110 so gonna be expensive to get both to 225
[4:29:49] SunTruth1: u running lw and tailoring ye
[4:38:57] magickharu: They don't have to fix anything. It's not a bug. More people doing it will make it have no profit
[4:40:12] magickharu: I agree, it should have a profit probably whole phase. Gold sink is huge right now too
[4:41:15] ahyepz: +
[4:41:18] magickharu: I mean, I think the salvage price will continue to drop and hover around the price of assuming you only have 1 of the profs, not 2.
[4:41:25] magickharu: So it should always be a profit, just not necessarily worth the time
[4:43:04] Tynax21: Greets from germany, on which realm are u playing?
[4:44:29] Tynax21: is ele shaman good?
[4:45:21] Tynax21: damn i hoped ele shaman is good in pvp ^^

[4:46:53] Tynax21: can u tell me why its so bad? caused by the long casttimes or why? i'm new at classic, tbh i dont have a clue what i'm doing here xD
[4:48:06] lusterr: I've been playing ele shaman and it's being really fun and somewhat powerful
[4:48:19] lusterr: I feel like I flame shock + lavaburst someone and it's a guaranted kill
[4:48:24] lusterr: If not, earth shock
[4:48:27] PermaSmug: 🩸
[4:48:48] ARROOCE: @lusterr how do u deal with 20 yard on flameshock? I feel like it was mad annoying when I was playing ele
[4:48:58] lusterr: Oh it is annoying
[4:49:05] lusterr: There's just no way around it
[4:50:04] PermaSmug: forced to play the superior spec
[4:50:12] PermaSmug: Sadge
[4:50:13] lusterr: I was leveling while being enh and I really liked it, but it felt so underwhelming with poor kit tools... maybe I just don't know how to play it properly
[4:50:26] iNSANEono: so were eatin good tonite

[5:57:31] Totterhovna: r10 max for sure with lvl 60 cuz they not gonna give ppl free epic mount
[5:58:14] SunTruth1: ur sleep schedule is actually insane for farming gold
[5:59:05] baabajaga: i thought they did classic for old players but i see its a mathematic cout and phisic game :D
[5:59:39] baabajaga: it should be WOW calculations classic sod
[6:00:00] SunTruth1: got the whole squad laughin
[6:00:10] Teplokot: Cant wait for my holypala to become a rogue with holy power instead cp. Fuck Cata let me spam Holy Light in peace  SMOrc
