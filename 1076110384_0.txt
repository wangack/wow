[0:25:31] Panasonic82: Here's and irrelevant question. Do you think people can do drugs casually (smoking weed) without it being a problem, or do you think it's something we tell ourself that we can control to defend doing it. Just curious to hear an honest outside opinion and not trying to start a debate here. I understand if the mods flag this message
[0:25:59] SeckSymbols: @Panasonic82 I smoke weed casually with my old roommate whenever I go to his place to chill. Absolutely nothing wrong with smoking weed
[0:26:11] SeckSymbols: I don't NEED weed, but I like it
[0:26:16] crotastar: Nothing wrong with it at all my good sir
[0:26:17] LittleLotta: blizzard gave up sending me free 7 day passes years ago lol

[0:31:43] fraser_91: I think I unlocked the appearance on a rogue which still worked even though they cant shoout it anymore
[0:32:11] Noshpan: Neighbors on the corner from me have been setting off fireworks since April.
[0:32:11] SeckSymbols: In other news, I'm glad Asmon enjoyed FF14 today. Even though stream snipers were annoying as hell
[0:32:21] Noshpan: And they're not the legal "safe & sane" ones
[0:32:25] TheUnknowing: so would a warrior
[0:32:29] Panasonic82: @Secksymbols Exactly. It's easy to feel incriminated when it's currently illegal in the country/state you live in. But to most of my friends, there is no such thing as casual smoking, and it's getting difficult to defend that position when your friends are pre-determined against it. <3

[0:35:17] bantuatha: Is it flyable zone in shadowland yet?
[0:35:36] bantuatha: Nice!
[0:36:00] SeckSymbols: @Panasonic82 In utah where I live, its still illegal here, and even when we passed medicinal use the church still tried to get their hands into it and manipulate the law. Its unfortunate because of how beneficial of a drug it is not just for people who need it medically, but for people like me who when having bad days, an edible or a simple joint does wonders
[0:36:06] bantuatha: Also you don't need to worry about the eye of Jailer anymore?

[0:37:23] theDirtyon3: noone is doing the caravan i saw it up for like 2 hours earlier
[0:38:32] HeresyHC: I wish the rares were like prepatch where they took a min to become targetable, some are too easy and die too fast

[0:40:35] Panasonic82: @Secksymbols I'm from Denmark, where we are currently far away from legalizing it, and the frustrating part is that the people regulating it, are the people that do not know the benefits of it. It's just so exhausting arguing with people whose stuck in the Reagan 'war against ANY drug' attitude. I don't applaud it, obviously, but the current perception of it is outdated

[0:50:05] jerexify: I think that's my biggest gripe with the community. A rare spawns and it's "BLOW ALL YOUR COOLDOWNS!" It's as if their goal is to allow as few people as possible to loot. But, that's almost always been an issue.
[0:50:06] theDirtyon3: have you seen the trinket for caster out of the armaments? @Towelliee

[1:13:11] Shadow_28: more people = ally i mean lol
[1:13:17] indiegarona: At that rate, why not let cross faction queue dungeons together
[1:13:20] Eikus11: is that normal or just rated BGs?
[1:13:30] Divinized: horde always!
[1:13:41] GamerKillance: Just get rid of the faction war. Its so fucking stupid at this point
[1:13:44] metavahn231: maybe you like humans and dont care about pvp
[1:13:48] Bizzytor: @lantern214 perception, escape artist, gift of the naaru, your friends play there?
[1:14:09] Aspir3l: YEP

[1:14:13] indiegarona: lol
[1:14:21] Lantern214: I know in Wotlk everyone goes ally
[1:14:22] GamerKillance: No more separate factions. At least with pvp and pve. Keep the story "war" if they want. That I will say hurts the game
[1:14:24] metavahn231: its just a minority issue
[1:14:42] Horseweave: Anyone in chat recruiting for Retail?
[1:14:57] Horseweave: Horde
[1:15:06] Horseweave: Venthyr Paladin
[1:15:11] Wesley1213: @Towelliee They need to start doing that with live fill groups with other factions to get better que times
[1:15:13] Kinghorn: half the alliance crying about same factions bgs never queued for pvp once, just crying to cry
[1:15:22] Squirtacus: @Horseweave our guild is
[1:15:24] metavahn231: prob would of been better to give alliance incentives to pvp
[1:15:33] Horseweave: Looking for love, laughs, and loot
[1:15:34] Wesley1213: For dungeons i mean
[1:15:34] Lantern214: But the player base are right though @Towelliee When ally has an issue, blizz does nothing, when horde have an issue, its resolved asap
[1:15:37] belfastcl: now they know what facing orc stun resist feels like
[1:15:41] Molvonos: @Kinghorn That's their warcry anyways. 'Not the face!'

[1:17:13] Horseweave: @squirtacus So what's your goal in Guild?
[1:17:34] Bizzytor: @lantern214 it must be hard going through life feeling like a victim all the time
[1:18:00] Broomba: He watched a lot YouTube cooking and a guy reporting on floods and water in streets
[1:18:41] Lantern214: @Bizzytor I play ally my man, I have every right to be mad
[1:19:13] metavahn231: i mean alliance already never queue'd so a non issue
[1:19:21] Horseweave: @towelliee Retail question for you as Tank. You feel any better playing Paladin now in 9.1?

[1:19:48] Molvonos: That was your first mistake @Lantern214. Playing Alliance.
[1:19:59] indiegarona: @Molvonos lol
[1:20:05] Bizzytor: @lantern214 no you don’t. It has literally 0 effect on you
[1:20:06] Horseweave: @molvonos lol
[1:20:06] Lantern214: @Molvonos Horde did not have paladin in classic.
[1:20:09] Molvonos: towDrunk
[1:20:23] Broomba: When does 2nd assault end? @towelliee
[1:20:50] indiegarona: Aww my buddy Tubbins.
[1:21:10] Lantern214: Honestly though, they should remove racials on retail. What's the point of having them, when that would resolve many imbalance issues
[1:21:15] Moonphire: This assault was much faster to complete than the previous one
[1:21:36] indiegarona: "No tea for you!"
[1:22:08] Bizzytor: No they need to remove the faction system
[1:22:09] splashyranger32: is shadowlands good again?

[1:23:05] ozzythegreat: i always forget about mine
[1:23:06] Jokervenom1978: I'm alliance all the way.
[1:23:11] Molvonos: I abuse the hell out of my racials.
[1:23:15] Molvonos: Warstomp's godly.
[1:23:34] indiegarona: I miss my old school Arcane Torrent
[1:23:52] Gohrek: It really isn't a racial thing. Many people leaning more towards Horde because it's a fantasy game and being a Human is just... Boring.

[1:52:16] Llamatude: i KNOW he does not work there
[1:52:37] PoppaMetal: apparently he was a author at blizzard watch before he took that position
[1:52:47] hgizaira: a game or part of a game is a product in software industry.
[1:53:09] Crocfacex: are you mainingf monk again in 9.1??
[1:53:09] allencoded: true separate account is all you can do now
[1:53:10] Skyinryan: damn theres an entire post on LSF about the dev calling asmongold an asshole LUL
[1:53:16] RhadigarTV: Who are we talking about?
[1:53:20] Moonphire: bUt I hAvE a dIsCLaImEr!
[1:53:31] Christofuhr: I feel like he was clearly writing that tweet with his Blizzard hat on which I think could be where the issue lies @Towelliee Regardless whether you agree with him or not, doing that to your games most popular personality is stupid
[1:53:36] PoppaMetal: he does
[1:53:40] Noshpan: Besides, we all know that WoW devs also play every MMO out there.
[1:53:41] Llamatude: i mean it came from tweet deck maybe he does have a burner and logged into wrong account lol
[1:53:43] PoppaMetal: at the end views are my own
[1:53:43] RogueBear: its 2021. these days if you say something remotely possibly offensive to even one person, you're horrible and deserve to be fired on the spot

[1:54:04] RhadigarTV: Adam does indeed at Blizzard

[1:54:09] RyanSMcCann: that archive contains a lot of porn
[1:54:19] 無職提督: idk get it
[1:54:25] RhadigarTV: But after that? I don't know for how much longer lol
[1:54:36] indiegarona: With all of the "at-will" clauses in terms of employment for many companies, they can fire you for anything. Not worth starting shit storms on social media.
[1:54:50] RhadigarTV: Exactly @Indiegarona
[1:54:53] indiegarona: Lula! <3
[1:55:00] RhadigarTV: Keep that to yourself and watch what you say
[1:55:05] RyanSMcCann: Azmond Gold does come off as a bit of a dick if you take him out of context
[1:55:09] Hedrins: and also you probably shouldn't insult the biggest streamer for said game rooKek
[1:55:14] indiegarona: @RhadigarTV indiLOVE
[1:55:17] Llamatude: HR will probably slap on the wrists.
[1:55:36] Christofuhr: @RogueBear Yeah I mean I'm an Asmon fan and I don't think anyone seriously wants him to be fired but the tweet was stupid and if anything kinda shows you that they really don't know how to engage with the community without pissing people off
[1:55:51] LaminatedTV: But asmongold is a dick. Zack, however, is not.
[1:55:52] CameronParadox: I mean he didn’t care lol

[1:56:34] Moonphire: zach literally said on his stream the other night that he's a huge dick and he knows it lol @LaminatedTV
[1:56:35] allencoded: i missed that one

[2:03:35] CameronParadox: It’s wow up and down
[2:04:08] NoobWANT3D: Well yeah, but was wondering if that up and down is really alive or something barely holding on.
[2:04:46] Eikus11: @YoungTravels millions of players so what ever you want to call that
[2:05:17] NoobWANT3D: alright..never mind lol
[2:05:20] CameronParadox: Queuing is still good that’s all that really matters to me
[2:06:12] NoobWANT3D: Gotcha, appreciate it.
[2:06:18] CameronParadox: Wow honestly isn’t going anywhere you can pick it up and start fresh. FFXIV for me had a little scare but than starting pick up and going strong too

[2:10:56] Superfragger: @Towelliee are you only using elvui for your ui?
[2:11:45] heydoublea: @Towelliee i watched asmongold stream of ff online and i just cant like it. The animations are not fluid, the weeb art, the ui is cluttered, no pvp, and its such a slower game

[2:12:23] XshadowturkeyX: i ran a deadmines with 2 people in tbc that never ran deadmines b4 ever
[2:12:26] XshadowturkeyX: no joke
[2:12:43] DeathMetalMarten: i'm new :)
[2:12:45] zjordan88: wish the dungeons were still somewhat similar to tbc its crazy how a DH can just run thru the dung alone skipping everything and soloing bosses it just feels weird lol
[2:12:56] Bonedit: wow isnt about leveling its about the endgame
[2:13:02] Christofuhr: I would love an expansion that revisits SOME of the old content, the old zones, doesn't need to do anything crazy but resyncing most of the main areas to the current timeline would be sick. I would love it to feel like the WORLD of Warcraft again @Towelliee
[2:13:03] Bonedit: 90% of wow is endgame
[2:13:04] Vile_: @zjordan88 You show me a DH who can solo something that's actually meaningful and I'll agree with you.
[2:13:23] Vile_: No one gives a shit if a DH can solo a normal dungeon or a heroic dungeon.
[2:13:38] heydoublea: @Towelliee i watched asmongold stream of ff online and i just cant like it. The animations are not fluid, the weeb art, the ui is cluttered, no pvp, and its such a slower game, thoughts on the game?
[2:13:46] josh8555: DH have a tank spec lol

[2:14:07] Vile_: @zeusreturned FF has PVP, the UI can be changed, and "lol weeb art" is a dumb gripe because it's Final Fantasy, a JRPG.
[2:14:20] AHeroicPanda: ^^^
[2:14:32] Vile_: Not to mention, the visuals in FF are stunning.
[2:14:43] zjordan88: was just in a dung with a dh that just left his healer n party behind and finished the dung in like 10 min
[2:14:56] zjordan88: was crazy boring
[2:15:49] neverbornlucky: 44 renown all we need for flying right
[2:15:54] Kensen2105: came back to wow after being gone since cata because of boredom and to see whats new, well guild is dead and server is dead
[2:15:54] Moobot: TBC has officially launched! || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch!
[2:15:59] mikejames01: @neverbornlucky yes
[2:16:07] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee how much gold you think you earn with the tank dungeon ques?
[2:16:19] mikejames01: I love WOW and SWTOR :D
[2:16:35] neverbornlucky: tailisin says the maw portal is a butthole
[2:16:44] HigameR4771: <3
[2:16:52] TheRabid_: FF is actually a challenge and the gear holds its value, and raids have repeatability where WoW survives soloy on fresh content.
[2:16:54] heydoublea: @Towelliee i think the next wow expansion is going to be good, they hired so many new people, along with no more covid, the next xpac is gonna be good
[2:16:59] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee if yr in heroic you always get lvl 60 gear
[2:17:00] MT_Smooky: @Kensen2105 cata was like 10 years ago, ofc ur guild is dead
[2:17:15] KhronikRage: absolutely.
[2:17:35] Kensen2105: @MT_Smooky well they all left to play classic according to the guild log and discord lol
[2:17:37] nickysicky19: nickysicky19 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:17:38] Keyastaron_: normal i mean*
[2:17:55] Christofuhr: I think the alt system they have is super interesting though
[2:17:56] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:17:57] Tequilawyrm: From what my friends who play FF14 tell me a lot of the "content" in ff14 past what is provided by Squenix is driven by players more than the game itself compared to WoW
[2:18:03] pwnage187: Not really there's alot more to it
[2:18:18] NitangXIV: FFXIV player here, I would argue the grinds in FFXIV are less and they reward more tangible goals than Retail WoW. Reward Systems for the grinds are more like Classic.
[2:18:22] Keyastaron_: oh wait yr leveling i seen the tool tip too youre able to use the gear if it says 60 the tool tip is in error
[2:18:30] Keyastaron_: asmongold also started FF XIV Kappa
[2:18:43] Kensen2105: i need to find me a new server to play on just to fill time
[2:18:44] Wheeellz: blizz releases things around ff on purpose
[2:18:54] Wheeellz: which is smart
[2:18:56] Dar_Rito: Pretty sure Blizzard does that on purpose too xD
[2:19:05] cuddlytoxic: there is also newgamee + in ff14
[2:19:09] Streamcrush: i couldn't watch asmon play, his groupies were obnoxious
[2:19:11] pwnage187: yes he did
[2:19:25] pwnage187: people where fucking stupid shit was a disaster
[2:19:28] josh8555: he was getting trolled hard lol

[2:19:29] Kensen2105: yea i felt sorry for him
[2:19:36] Hedrins: there was so much reading aswell FeelsBadMan
[2:19:38] Wheeellz: the worst part is a lot of those people were FF players
[2:19:40] Keyastaron_: all his stream does that to make "good" content
[2:19:46] pronkk_: who? asmon?
[2:19:49] Christofuhr: Honestly if most of us had to put up with thousands of spergs EVERYDAY in any game he tries to play, I would be WAAAAAAAAAAAAY more toxic than he is.
[2:19:58] Wheeellz: all the savage mounts and stuff hovering around him
[2:20:02] Dar_Rito: You could see his enjoyment come out when he got to go into the instanced fights away from the crowd :3
[2:20:17] pwnage187: dont blame FF players for that it just those kind of peoiple
[2:20:21] NitangXIV: He's expressed he'd like to at least hit 80, we'll see if that actually happens lol
[2:20:37] dreamwalker213: It went better than I expected for having 200k+ viewers at one point
[2:20:37] heydoublea: @Towelliee what would be your next best mmo aside from wow, i know you played everything, swtor, eso, ffiv?
[2:20:40] Keyastaron_: make its a one and done type of game
[2:20:42] denflup: yep,
[2:20:46] Keyastaron_: maybe its a *
[2:20:48] heydoublea: or vdo
[2:20:50] Bonedit: Asmon has 2 much invested in WOW
[2:20:50] heydoublea: bdo
[2:20:57] diivil92: he was like yeah i crit something for 13k though it was annoying randos killing his stuff
[2:21:02] neverbornlucky: its not like 9.1 requires much attention
[2:21:06] Hedrins: he said yesterday and today he is gonna play it then we will see
[2:21:21] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee
[2:21:26] Keyastaron_: the tool tip is in error
[2:21:47] Skyinryan: asmon had over 210k viewers at one point today
[2:21:49] Skyinryan: was crazy
[2:21:56] Keyastaron_: happened to me too i was curious
[2:22:05] Keyastaron_: @Skyinryan it was
[2:22:10] heydoublea: of what you like, and i forgott bdo
[2:22:20] diivil92: if they added group finder to BC it would be a god tier expansion
[2:22:34] Bonedit: star wars as in SWTOR?
[2:22:38] flandre619: i think the only patch in FF that wasn't released at the same time as WoW was patch 4.2 in FF released a few months after antorus
[2:22:42] Keyastaron_: i play it on the PS5 hard to play IMO from playing on PC for the last 8 years
[2:22:48] kovachov: what about trying to play LoL?
[2:22:55] akia03: is everquest 2 still around?
[2:23:06] Dar_Rito: EQ2 is
[2:23:29] Keyastaron_: i never got into the story of FF XIV
[2:23:29] flandre619: stormblood was right at tomb, same date
[2:23:35] Streamcrush: EQ1 is still around, heh
[2:23:36] neverbornlucky: wow goes down i scream i am free
[2:23:37] Keyastaron_: does it make you go in order of the expacs?
[2:23:51] Vile_: @keyatlass Yes, you have to do the Main Story Quests to progress.
[2:23:56] heydoublea: @Towelliee lets be real, we all asmon hates ffiv, its apparent but hes getting big money which would make anyone want to stream it in the meantime
[2:23:57] flandre619: shadowbringers was 1 week before eternal palace
[2:24:00] denflup: YEP he will
[2:24:09] NoobWANT3D: EQ2 was great but didn’t last well
[2:24:09] denflup: FF 14 its just a dif game
[2:24:18] Dar_Rito: Of course he will. He's going to prog the new raid get AOTC then go back to FF when there's nothing else to do :P
[2:24:20] pwnage187: bothh games are great
[2:24:23] Keyastaron_: @Vile_ thanks kinda confusing for me to go throught it xD i do EVERY quest xD
[2:24:31] Kisswani: @keyatlass not just the mainstory of the expansions , the mainstory in every patch of the expansion as well
[2:24:47] Xychotic: Xychotic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months!

[2:25:46] Kisswani: @Vile_ I usually like to clarify that because when i first beat Castrum and Thought i was done with ARR I was surprised to find out i had a 100 quests more to do lol , almost made quit
[2:25:52] coffeeatm: Not a chance
[2:25:58] denflup: he wont do it man
[2:26:04] 24sevn: Ff14 had all time player peak on steam today
[2:26:05] Aspir3l: yeah xD wonder he if he'll really do it tho
[2:26:13] coffeeatm: If he dont like the combat, max lvl 80 wont change the fact
[2:26:21] ArcaneLight: im trying out FF14 on a trial account i dont think i will enjoy the game for much more its just not my kind of mmo, but i do get why so many people enjoy it or even prefer it over WoW
[2:26:36] Streamcrush: there is no other mmo that "feels" as good to play as wow. They just don't have that responsiveness to the controls.
[2:26:44] Aubue: same
[2:27:04] 1337RAIDS: waiting on new world and ashes of creation.
[2:27:04] Moobot: 9.1 WoW official Patch Notes | https://www.wowhead.com/news/official-patch-9-1-chains-of-domination-patch-notes-323035
[2:27:06] Hedrins: i just want Tera to be more popular FeelsBadMan the combat is amazing in that game
[2:27:17] Vile_: Yep, and I'm leaving WoW for Endwalker KEKW
[2:27:28] Vile_: AOTC or not.
[2:27:34] Kisswani: the story fo ShB was amazing , but I would take WoW voice acting , cinematics and the overall world feel over that imo
[2:27:41] PadidinJones: Hey captain Towelliee hows it going?
[2:27:54] ctrxbro: Guild Wars 2 will be the next talking point their next expansion is coming early 2022
[2:28:12] A_Klimas: they will. this one was hardly finished, they are behind for sure
[2:28:21] Craizar: I think I might have finally just played WoW for too long. FF just feels fresh atm. Don't know how long that will last but we'll see.

[2:28:39] pwnage187: Savage and unreal is awesome
[2:28:54] pwnage187: just need a static group
[2:29:02] Tequilawyrm: @Towelliee What are the raids in SWTOR like? I wasn't a huge fan of FF14 encounter design. It felt pretty stagnant across multiple encounters
[2:29:15] DeathMetalMarten: hm in swtor is a joke though
[2:29:16] Dar_Rito: The Savage Raids and Extreme/Unreal Trials are quite fun and Ulitimate is truly challenging ^^
[2:29:21] Vile_: @Tequilawyrm Sounds like you've not done Savage/Ultimate/Unreal/Extremes.
[2:29:22] coffeeatm: @Towelliee my beef with ff14 is the "slow" combat and yes i got a few lvl 80 jobs and no fillers dont make combat feel faster. Even as a monk 1.8 sec global is still slow as shit
[2:29:27] yogapriest: just got bis tirnket tome of insight so OP
[2:29:31] slufftx: @towelliee shadowform
[2:29:45] Tequilawyrm: @Vile_ I dind't make it far enough to care tbqh. No hate for FF14, i think it's a fine game, it just didn't grip me
[2:30:03] Vile_: @coffeeatm There's no "filler" for most jobs in FF because you have either a rotation or combos to use.

[2:30:28] Megladong: are a lot of korthia rares bugged?
[2:30:42] JTeeh: Towelliee! Looking good brother! How’s the TRT treating you?
[2:30:47] Horseweave: If they give us Blitzball in Endwalker, I'm HARD switching to FF14
[2:31:02] Tequilawyrm: @Vile_ Like i try to compare the first few trials/dungeons I did to early wow stuff and it feels pretty similar but i've seen some videos of my buddys doing raids/alliance raids and a lot of it still has the same visual clutter that boils down to "stand here" but again, i haven't ACTUALLY done it so i might be wrong
[2:31:33] Vile_: @Tequilawyrm It's just a very narrow, one-dimensional way of looking at a single aspect of it.

[2:32:54] Anguyen92ab: Holy cow, that's the good stuff.
[2:32:57] Alastree: Gourmet
[2:33:01] Vile_: @Tequilawyrm That's the thing: You're going into it with an uninterested viewpoint. If you reduce the mechanics and what's necessary to "ok it looks like you just need to stand in the right place," then you're already setting yourself up for disappointment.
[2:33:15] Vile_: I assure you, there's more to it than positioning.
[2:33:17] Dar_Rito: Ooo, I haven't had a good chicken cordon bleu in forever :3
[2:33:20] Tequilawyrm: @Vile_ Like i've watched most of alexander and the newest Nier raid and the only thing that really gripped me was that encounter where there's buildings flying around and you can see the squenix building
[2:33:22] Flippyyz: thats what happens when your org is owned by jerry jones or whoever
[2:33:23] aayaronn: what does pog stand for? srs question
[2:33:39] A_Klimas: like a last meal form based on how hard they go hahahah
[2:33:50] Tequilawyrm: @Vile_ I will say, from what my buddy has told me, they handle tank mechanic design in a much more interesting way than most of WoWs stuff
[2:34:02] Kisswani: @dayyum708 a twitch expression of excitement
[2:34:11] HaggisLaddie: oh shit, that's dangerous
[2:34:25] deadman385: CHINA number 1
[2:34:26] Vile_: @Tequilawyrm Right, and that's fine -- I'm not trying to convince you otherwise. I'm just saying that you shouldn't look at something so narrowly if you haven't experienced it yourself. Obviously there's something there to enjoy that's more complex than "just stand at x, y, and z," else people wouldn't do it.
[2:34:28] HaggisLaddie: China never fail to pop off
[2:34:29] coffeeatm: When are the korean gone dominate wow !

[2:46:14] A_Klimas: unless the tier is trash
[2:46:17] TexValhalla: ^ actual truth in that
[2:46:23] Christofuhr: Both Echo and Limit have 3-4 players with massive 5head brains to come up with many viable strats that they will try, test and discard up to and during progression. No other guilds have this right now in the same way.
[2:46:24] dimofodi: i could see a majority going back if they cleaned up the crap that happened to break them up in the first placer
[2:46:27] Anguyen92ab: They have the money, but do they have the trust nowadays?
[2:46:46] neverbornlucky: method taught us great wisdom
[2:46:56] Christofuhr: @Anguyen92ab I genuinely don't think anyone really cares
[2:47:10] dimofodi: that's what im saying if echo doesnt take it, i agree with you, i couild see them folding back in to method

[2:47:42] Anguyen92ab: Well, if anyone in Echo wants to go back to Method, they want to make sure that the same misconducts does not happen again.
[2:47:44] TexValhalla: especially the one with the anima buffs KEKW
[2:47:46] zalimah: Blood dk stack

[2:48:39] BISNationTV: wad is best covenant for blood dk raid
[2:48:40] Rudric_Ice: grip em by de ass
[2:48:52] Christofuhr: @Anguyen92ab I don't think anything like that could happen again in, it was a crazy set of circumstances that lead to the two main incidents happening. It was a management failure and they have hired a whole team of people now to deal with anything like that
[2:48:57] tdpark_: how good is brew in sanctum raid?
[2:48:59] Hedrins: and also with that new sword that eats other weapons, fury warrior might just pop off completely
[2:48:59] theDirtyon3: Naowh on blood dk again monkaS

[2:49:59] catjamvibing: Limits gonna bring the Survival hunter year of the Spear Baby
[2:50:05] Christofuhr: I think we will see Brewmaster tanks and the 2nd tank will either be a prot pala (if they think they can survive) or a prot-warrior again. @Towelliee

[2:50:51] Addetetet: Please don’t hype up fury just because of seeing max Ilvl patchwerk sims
[2:50:57] Allexi88: From what we've seen of their streams, they've been gearing 2 Blood DKS, a prot pally and a Warrior.
[2:50:58] Rudric_Ice: Pog
[2:51:10] 1337RAIDS: are you going to be playing ashes of creation towelie?
[2:51:15] Superfragger: imagine not having the autosolver wa
[2:51:20] Christofuhr: If they can do bring a prot-paladin, it can survive, and they do CRAZY damage and have ashen hollow @Towelliee

[2:51:23] theDirtyon3: LUL

[2:52:01] PadidinJones: Are you doing dungo finder or carry?

[2:52:39] Allexi88: I mean one of Limits tanks is doing dailies on a Prot Pally
[2:52:41] tdpark_: warrior?
[2:52:42] Rudric_Ice: any dh tanks ?
[2:52:43] A_Klimas: based off sloots stream today (unless he was trolling) he is not playing monk/dh/druid this tier for prog
[2:53:06] Clicklesly: So he's gonna dps? Kappa
[2:53:16] hgizaira: he said he's playing druid afaik
[2:53:17] Christofuhr: You forget they have Ashen Hollow, still a busted CD and it's not always about the total damage but HOW it comes out @Towelliee
[2:53:28] A_Klimas: he was picking which one to dump for him and it was betwqeen those three
[2:53:33] kowaikoro: world first guilds are literally doing korthia cause there is zero content atm, making comp assumptions based on dailys is hilarious
[2:53:52] Hedrins: Is the instant covenant switch already patched in or not?
[2:54:28] Christofuhr: All I'm saying is if they need more DPS on a certain fight a very easy way of squeezing out 1k over a fight or doing a silly amount of damage in a short space of time is to bring a Prot Paladin with Ashen Hollow
[2:54:43] scrublama: Is that a border on your actionbars or just standard elvui actionbars?
[2:54:47] RoxxusPlays: cant wait til 9.3 when covenant swapping will be free and you dont lose progress
[2:55:13] Rudric_Ice: there will be a ret pally i'm sure
[2:55:14] Christofuhr: I just think there's a world where they just need a little more DPS on a fight and it's a very easy way of getting it

[2:56:33] Allexi88: Warrior, Blood DK is likely as well.

[3:13:01] Pey0: What's good T
[3:13:09] A_Klimas: tanks in retail need to research the routes, tanks in tbc need to be patient hahah
[3:13:09] Moonphire: it's only game, why you hafta be mad
[3:13:33] d3momhunt3r1988: it was a Druid and warrior that we lost by leaving the guild.
[3:13:43] diivil92: i think it was after his millions of AC runs and locks and mages ripping threat

[3:14:16] coffeeatm: Thats why i play a rogue, ToT tank allways me no problem
[3:14:18] Xeeshki: thats the reason why i quit retail, i always got shit on for taking the "wrong" route even in a low dungeon, i couldnt handle it anymore
[3:14:19] d3momhunt3r1988: happens to durpy a lot
[3:14:28] Folkja: with warrior tanks I just nuke adds that dont deal much damage to me :D

[3:16:20] Capt_Logun: Gotta trust your cooldowns
[3:16:23] ClayMatioNation: Most new tanks don't know you need to understand aggro for multiple mobs
[3:16:25] A_Klimas: and the confidence to tell people "no we died because you fucked up, not me"
[3:16:43] pixxelina: very true!
[3:17:04] idenkaz_: i just leave and go my way if i get shit on as a tank who cares, not me KEKW

[3:18:03] coffeeatm: 10 sec :o
[3:18:03] idenkaz_: tanks are tanks not leaders. you dont sign up for a leader role period. tank is tank thats it
[3:18:08] hoodlife73: mark targets helps
[3:18:10] frank_uo: who has the most stress tank or healer?
[3:18:21] Christofuhr: Tanks in M+ are leaders @magemyway
[3:18:24] Keyastaron_: healer for sure @Frankz707
[3:18:41] Capt_Logun: At the same time you gotta own your errors
[3:18:54] Christofuhr: LUL
[3:19:01] A_Klimas: heals probably, tanks are wrangling cats but healers are the ones fixing everyone's fuckups
[3:19:08] mavis316: Healers take a lot of heat, I can’t call who has it worse
[3:19:09] A_Klimas: puls in tbc you gadda downrank heals
[3:19:11] SlackerSlack017: lol
[3:19:35] Envythisnoob: lol perfect interpretation
[3:19:38] Folkja: my favorite: healer pulls aggro, runs out away from the tank
[3:19:39] Rudric_Ice: that happened to when i healed for the first time LUL
[3:19:39] d3momhunt3r1988: Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:19:41] Capt_Logun: @Towelliee It's been a while since I've been buy but your room has had some serious upgrades

[3:20:13] d3momhunt3r1988: man up and keep me alive lol
[3:20:46] A_Klimas: in retail tank is more stressful tho, people expect you to know routes even if they dont
[3:20:59] A_Klimas: and guide them to victory
[3:21:00] Hedrins: i have been healing since Wotlk and the stuff some people do in "tense" situations is insane LUL
[3:21:16] Rudric_Ice: how many shadow priests will we see in WF groups ?
[3:21:26] Capt_Logun: Very cool
[3:21:37] icemanj99: @Towelliee has Ony gotten used to the flooring, or is she still sliding a bit?
[3:21:44] d3momhunt3r1988: @a_klimas you can watch some dratnos videos for routes these days.
[3:21:50] Capt_Logun: I think in retail you can get by with just pushing forward and keeping dps busy
[3:22:29] stealth2100: dispersion my man
[3:22:34] A_Klimas: id say anyone can but most groups expect the tank to even if they havnen't themselves @d3momhunt3r1988
[3:22:38] stealth2100: reduce damage
[3:23:02] d3momhunt3r1988: what I do personally is do them as dps, then learn the routes as the weeks go to see what routes work best. I pug a lot though.
[3:23:24] Christofuhr: It'll be 2-3 depending on the fight. Spriest damage on more than two targets is still garbage so on KT we might see less than 3 but I think in general 3 Spriests is probably gonna be a thing yeah
[3:23:47] Capt_Logun: It's way easier to install and after hearing some of the horror stories from Invine homes, people who get real wood flooring tend to complain more about jobs.
[3:23:48] Reydien: wtb server with working rift rares :(
[3:24:12] A_Klimas: hahaha
[3:24:15] SlackerSlack017: did u see the drama between wow dev and asmon on his FF stream?

[3:24:45] frank_uo: them wood prices are high af in cali
[3:24:54] catjamvibing: i wish i was a handy man useful skills
[3:24:55] heydoublea: have you even took a picture of your desk setup?
[3:24:59] Christofuhr: Yeah good contractors are worth it though @Towelliee
[3:24:59] SlackerSlack017: poor guy gettin harassed
[3:25:00] heydoublea: i wanna see a front view of it
[3:25:09] d3momhunt3r1988: @a_klimas some people have their expectations too high , especially for groups that want a carry. But these days you can't just go blind into m+ above 10s
[3:25:09] A_Klimas: honestly im not surprised devs dislike asmon
[3:25:15] Rudric_Ice: lore still working for blizzard ?
[3:25:19] SlackerSlack017: @sensualmage think there are some links on wow gd forums

[3:25:33] KragnosWoW: asmon got to lvl 20 in one day on final fantasy, is that a good pace?
[3:25:44] seo1978: but he mirros the views of thousands of pwying cutomers maybe they should pay some attention
[3:25:52] idenkaz_: in that position. no you don't say shit like that wtf-
[3:25:58] seo1978: personally dont like him but...
[3:26:03] A_Klimas: he sends his spurg followers on people, if i were still at blizz i'd hate him too
[3:26:36] Christofuhr: 100%
[3:26:37] SlackerSlack017: true
[3:26:52] Hedrins: best way to grind out renown?
[3:27:01] Capt_Logun: ^^
[3:27:08] Christofuhr: I only shit on the game because I love it and pussying around and saying something is fine when it's not helps nobody
[3:27:10] swordart_19: @kapitanslowwow thousands lol barely 1 realm
[3:27:12] Rudric_Ice: does ion play on his resto shaman anymore ?
[3:27:47] swordart_19: @christ0fur don't, you don't shut on gym leave gym if don't like.
[3:28:10] seo1978: @swordart_19 so there arent thousands of people who dont particularly like the direction the game has gone? take your blinkers off ffs.

[3:28:53] Christofuhr: That is correct @Towelliee on the DMF shit you just said
[3:28:55] 11000BG: @swordart_19 ty, thats what i figuered, but wasnt sure 100%
[3:28:55] qtceef: Deaths advances gives litterly nothing

[3:29:13] BrunoArmond: the sockets are from the cataloged research right?

[3:29:28] qtceef: sockets from tier 6
[3:29:46] Christofuhr: @swordart_19 imagine getting a steak in a restaurant that you think is cooked wrong and sitting there and eating it in silence...
[3:29:49] coffeeatm: @Epiclurker27893 People think they can get 30 renow levels by just questing

[3:35:08] KragnosWoW: I wouldve started a free trial for FF but thats not an option on steam and im too lazy to do it on a separate client

[3:35:35] idenkaz_: changing the game because of a feeling and not actual feedback that is giving durin ptr.
[3:35:53] swordart_19: July 4th FIREWORKS inc
[3:35:59] Feeos: the game would actually be dead, servers gone of blizz listened to everything
[3:36:06] swordart_19: Streamers feedback LUL
[3:36:15] givmeafrekinname: @KragnosWoW Wait that's not available on steam? That's surprising. IS it a console only thing or like througfh FF own launncher if they have one.
[3:36:16] swordart_19: biased for self pros
[3:36:18] Christofuhr: I wish they would contact people and request some feedback on why their class is underperforming. The Havoc balancing this tier for example was shockingly bad and showed they have no idea why that spec sucked. @Towelliee
[3:36:36] Christofuhr: They got it right in the end
[3:36:45] swordart_19: Data are mighty
[3:37:02] SepirotBG: can I ask a stupid question how can I open adventure guide???
[3:37:10] KragnosWoW: @jmg1988 idk steam didnt allow me to try the trial, it allows me to download a demo but idk if thats the free trial of if my account would be saved if i ended up liking the game and wanted to continue
[3:37:11] Texas_Mizfit: darkmoon faire is up
[3:37:12] coffeeatm: "We all" 2 % of the playerbase if not less ( forum warriors )
[3:37:14] zalimah: wellllllllll even if we dont like something we still do it because there is nothing else to do so the data is skewed

[3:37:38] Danat: what was changed in korthia?
[3:37:49] 5gz_5g: EVERYONE does torghast man, not many love it. Try to measure that as a stat ... lets be real
[3:38:02] Rudric_Ice: @mikejames01 i was just replying to the guy who was talkin about blizzard worrying about asmon playing FF
[3:38:04] Hedrins: i love the new torghast tho
[3:38:04] FURL_: for sure they do
[3:38:14] danathar_: Do you agree with Blizzard when they use data to prove a point of success of content via activity %? Imo people will always do content if mandatory, that doesnt mean its GOOD content. @Towelliee
[3:38:15] swordart_19: True
[3:38:21] Nokterian: you can use the corridor mount @Towelliee
[3:38:29] zalimah: @5gz_5g Exactly! when we are forced to do content of course data shows a lot of people do it but hardly anyone enjoys doing it
[3:38:30] Christofuhr: I mean we've been testing the raids since day 1 @Towelliee
[3:38:38] ice_ross: and they used to do that pre-streaming anyway
[3:38:43] 5gz_5g: People doing the content =/= people enjoing it is what I am trying to say
[3:38:45] KragnosWoW: Idk if Blizzard does this but RiotGames 100% does all their in game balancing based on the World Championships and pro play
[3:38:50] mrrazputin: what are you doing with another paladin ?
[3:38:57] mikejames01: @Rudi_Ice oh my god lol I am sorry then :(
[3:38:59] swordart_19: @5gz_5g speak for yourself.
[3:39:37] Christofuhr: I have never met a single person who enjoys doing Torghast or the old Maw dailies
[3:39:44] edeasknight: like those steam reviews that have 200 hours played and say the game sucks
[3:39:49] swordart_19: if you do it pass the reward minimum :P
[3:39:49] Skizzurp: its a little boring buts its a lot of new mounts and its only 1 week lol. once raid starts opening and m+ opens up it will be back to normal content
[3:39:54] edeasknight: players cant save themselves :D
[3:40:06] 911Viking: i just returned.. what did they change about torghast?
[3:40:08] tdpark_: KEKW

[3:40:14] TwoStripes: @Towelliee your thoughts on the disabled human racial in korthia?
[3:40:17] virgoqt: KEKW
[3:40:17] zalimah: blizzard needs to listen to somone! becuse atm they dont
[3:40:22] FURL_: i think its meta as hell right now to shit on blizzard. which is unfortunate.
[3:40:22] filipebar: <----- likes the new torghast
[3:40:22] 5gz_5g: But you engaged in it, which means you were enjoying it in blizz's eyes
[3:40:24] Nokterian: Torghast is still torghast
[3:40:24] swordart_19: I got my phoenix yesterday it is sick and animation.

[3:40:44] ryanc1124: nobody dislikes torghast they just dislike farming it for legendarys on every alt
[3:40:47] Aidiand: Sadge No friends

[3:40:58] Rudric_Ice: what do u think devs care more about the casuals or the higher content players ?
[3:41:01] 5gz_5g: How do they Measure enjoyment? :) tell me pls
[3:41:03] zalimah: i doubt a couple of million are currently playing in the US region
[3:41:09] danathar_: I think that the fact that the game is losing players is better than any survey or data. Which is so sad because personally I love this game. I really want to want to play it, if you get me. @Towelliee
[3:41:13] SlackerSlack017: @Tousham agreed
[3:41:14] swordart_19: @rudi_ice no one specific
[3:41:15] 11000BG: torghast would be fine if it is mandatory to only go once per week, now twice. but other then taht its ok
[3:41:21] Christofuhr: Yeah you're not wrong. But get rid of Soul Ash from Torghast and see how many people still do that shit @Towelliee
[3:41:41] Velladyn: I went in blind with 9.1 and I have been enjoying it a lot

[3:42:38] FURL_: its meta to hate blizzard.
[3:42:43] swordart_19: true
[3:42:46] SlackerSlack017: i think they should cater a variety of options to get leggos but then again it is hard to compromise to everyone
[3:42:47] tdpark_: REEEE
[3:42:48] Bixster: player think the way they play wow is the right way
[3:42:49] Rudric_Ice: True LUL
[3:42:54] 11000BG: you are wrong Towelie, i like m+ so it must be cool!
[3:43:07] Skizzurp: we get like 10 dailies and its too many we get 3 in korthia and its too few lolol
[3:43:07] zalimah: how many wow streamers/youtubers would actually still play without all the money you guys are making tho

[3:43:15] Pufendorf99: "....and why do I hate it? Because someone else told me to."
[3:43:15] confewsed: Not every player :)
[3:43:23] BogdanCaba: It's not just the WoW playerbase it's the whole Social media and online population, which runs in the billions
[3:43:27] Beastafied: agree to disagreee...your not going to win every agrument. so, don't try.
[3:43:27] metavahn231: general rule of them the content you hate the most is prob the most loved content
[3:43:31] Envythisnoob: you think you do, but you dont
[3:43:37] TwoStripes: i am obviously always right Kappa
[3:43:48] swordart_19: @twostripes KEKW
[3:43:52] KragnosWoW: no one inviting a 218 hunter into +9 torghast LUL

[3:43:56] moodyjim: I miss my TD!
[3:43:58] Bahamut145: corruption was awesome
[3:44:03] PadidinJones: TD was fucking awesome
[3:44:03] DuckZzy: no, we hate world quest, because they are long, pointless, and with no meanigfull purpose.
[3:44:08] Rudric_Ice: Corruptions were so fun
[3:44:11] Christofuhr: I simply think if you have to lock mandatory player power behind content to make people do it, the content is probably shite. @Towelliee
[3:44:15] zalimah: if anyone enjoyed farming their cloaks to max IL across their main and alts then you are a liar
[3:44:15] HumanityDH: corruption was fun. essences were fun. colelcting them on mains was also fun just not on alts. corruption after vendor came out was ok
[3:44:18] Morri_4u: ppl parroting opinions of popular faces as well
[3:44:19] Nokterian: WQ's right now are not fun
[3:44:28] Nokterian: there long and tedious
[3:44:29] swordart_19: @duckzzy well don't do them then
[3:44:30] filipebar: I treat WoW as a time sink there is only one thing i can 100% say i HATED.... Garrisons in WoD and even then it was a mild hatred
[3:44:31] danathar_: @christ0fur 100% agree!
[3:44:32] PadidinJones: @Towelliee everyone is turning into Karen and Darren on this shit
[3:44:35] RogueBear: corruption was a cool feature that was implemented poorly
[3:44:40] Reydien: or the fun one: "you didn't actually like corruption, you just liked damage" 3head take
[3:44:41] mrrazputin: Why are you lvling another paladin ? is this EU ?
[3:44:42] Skizzurp: infinite stars used to hit for over 1m in raid lol was so fun
[3:44:42] BericTV: I liked BFA WQ’s way better
[3:44:52] swordart_19: @duckzzy I think they are Pog now :P
[3:45:01] mikejames01: I miss old dallies like in MOP lol
[3:45:02] Moonphire: tedious af
[3:45:06] A_Klimas: i do not liek them
[3:45:07] TwoStripes: Its normal, WOW players will always whine a bout pretty much everything, especially when their class is not on TOP
[3:45:08] kaihole: WQ's suck because we don't have flying
[3:45:16] Nokterian: WQ in legion and BfA where short and fun
[3:45:16] Bahamut145: Gonna like WQ's alot more when flying gets here
[3:45:17] zalimah: what data could they possibly have telling them if somone is having fun or not when its required to do!!!!!!
[3:45:19] SKgaming876: Corruption was cool, it gearing corruption was horrible imo, way too much rng
[3:45:20] soth_klf: just because people are doing WQs that doesnt mean they "like" it :P
[3:45:26] HumanityDH: BFA overall was more fun than shadowlands. WQs were ez and relaxing to do espacially with flying. essences made classes good. corruption made classes fun. s2 and s4 affix were so good
[3:45:31] Rudric_Ice: legion WQ's were fun

[3:45:35] Pablo1983: I miss Legion and Bfa World Quests
[3:45:47] DuckZzy: and simply because most of people can t express their feeling they will say i hate world quest so as you should.
[3:45:55] Christofuhr: They didn't change tyrannical though, they just are going to force people to do it now to get their KSM
[3:46:14] Christofuhr: I actually like Tyrannical
[3:46:19] metavahn231: the average player is no where near as picky as the vocal minority
[3:46:20] Christofuhr: To be clear
[3:46:20] Crowzcut: y
[3:46:22] FURL_: they nerfed the HP
[3:46:25] Reydien: nerfed it from like 40% hp to 30% iirc
[3:46:28] danathar_: Didnt they change anything.
[3:46:29] DuckZzy: because they don t really know why, but they feel it.
[3:46:32] HumanityDH: they did. and ppl still didnt play it. now they made it so u have to play it for rewrds
[3:46:34] metavahn231: something has to be truly bad for a casual to not like it
[3:46:38] Zettabyte: affixes FeelsBadMan
[3:46:47] givmeafrekinname: Didn't Blizz kinda say fuck you to the players forcing players to run those affixes though for season 2 achieve? Might be wrong on that.
[3:46:56] metavahn231: not just nit picky type of bad
[3:47:04] swordart_19: Tyrannical shows who is Pepega
[3:47:05] Rudric_Ice: ION said some people love doin WQ's and they have the data
[3:47:06] Christofuhr: I just wish they could come up with something a little cooler than: "these mobs have more HP and do more damage" to distinguish the two weeks - I would LOVE a change <3
[3:47:15] FURL_: @Towelliee do you think the game is too hard at the top end?
[3:47:16] Skizzurp: you should have to run tyrannical tho you should be able to do boss fight mechanics for more than 1 rotation
[3:47:22] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @zalimah (warning)
[3:47:27] tdpark_: gold :)
[3:47:32] metavahn231: renown catchup
[3:47:39] Bruustu: big true
[3:47:44] kowaikoro: full sweep off korthia gives more anima then world quests KEKW
[3:47:45] A_Klimas: my alt loves it for the free 220 gear
[3:47:48] Velladyn: Anima is 10000% better now than it was before 9.1
[3:47:51] swordart_19: @jmg1988 you are not forced to do anything in wow LUL
[3:47:56] Streamcrush: transmog was one of the best things to ever happen to the game
[3:47:57] Moonphire: ATT has 9.8 Million D/L's
[3:48:06] danathar_: Participation isnt proof that its good content though.
[3:48:07] Moobot: Calm the spam, @coffeeatm (warning)
[3:48:07] A_Klimas: in 3 days i got 4 pieces of 220
[3:48:09] Velladyn: Korthia just shits out anima everywhere
[3:48:10] Christofuhr: Collections is something enjoyed by players of all school levels.
[3:48:12] swordart_19: Anima Pog need moaar
[3:48:12] zalimah: Omg when u have to do world quest for rep and whatever else it doesnt mean its fun
[3:48:38] DuckZzy: this is anime shi.t , a mmorpg should not envolve around collecting cosmetic as main pourpse
[3:48:39] Bonedit: but them doing WQ for anima doesnt mean they like it, participation doesnt mean enjoyment
[3:48:39] swordart_19: @zalimah you don't have to do them for anything clearly you are clueless
[3:48:42] Rudric_Ice: hey i ain't complaining giff me more anima LUL
[3:48:53] catjamvibing: ive done 10 world quests in the last 2 weeks LUL
[3:48:55] zalimah: @swordart_19 I quit when shadowlands got delayed so you are correct
[3:48:59] A_Klimas: the WQ's suck but the korthria rares are *chef;s kiss*
[3:49:00] Christofuhr: They made them not mandatory, which was really good
[3:49:07] Christofuhr: That was a good change
[3:49:10] Akitor123: there is too low kill 1 mob WQ this xpac and this sucks xd
[3:49:16] BericTV: I miss WQ’s making me more powerful.
[3:49:17] swordart_19: @zalimah so why the fuck you talk nonsense you know nothing about
[3:49:21] stealth2100: in order to kill that data, everyone would have to stop playing, or at least 90% of the population. Which is close to impossible.
[3:49:39] zalimah: @swordart_19 I played daily since 2007 till then so i have the right to speak my opinion
[3:49:45] Rudric_Ice: FeelsBadMan
[3:49:48] Hedrins: is that a bad thing tho?
[3:49:49] zodd_amhai: i enjoyed shadowlands more than BFA tbh
[3:49:49] Skyinryan: crazy, been playing since classic and legion was my favorite
[3:49:52] Moonphire: yup by far my least played
[3:49:53] Nokterian: SL is my least played already
[3:49:56] metavahn231: well everyone knows 9.0 sucked
[3:49:57] Lemonsqze: Sadge
[3:50:02] swordart_19: @zalimah jaded boomer with 0 knowledge go play bc
[3:50:13] kowaikoro: oof thats brutal
[3:50:14] Shifty_CZ: "I" ..so everyone
[3:50:16] KragnosWoW: Unpopular opinion but castle nathria was amazing
[3:50:17] BericTV: That’s why I grind Korthia. Power. Gotta get those sockets.
[3:50:19] Moonphire: I enjoyed BFA so much more
[3:50:22] DuckZzy: big true towliee
[3:50:23] metavahn231: legendaries are not even as good as azerite powers really
[3:50:27] KingSlayerYotam: you and asmon playing different games 3 days after the patch? unheard off tbh
[3:50:27] swordart_19: @kragnoswow was Pog
[3:50:28] Rudric_Ice: 9.0 didn't suck the content drought made 9.0 look bad
[3:50:30] hgizaira: 9.0 didn't suck LUL

[3:51:00] metavahn231: content drought killed the overall quality of 9.0
[3:51:03] TexValhalla: well the system's entirety is just horrible imo few things are actually worth doing everything else just feels like a massive drag/chore
[3:51:19] Bixster: thats the sad part for me. i am not a raid logger and thats why i loved legion + bfa

[3:51:37] Nokterian: jeej?
[3:51:41] Fubar4585: I feel like its the fact that there are so many conversations that are unfavorable to WoW. Data be damned....WoW has a bad rep socially. Youtube, twitter, etc. its mostly bad things. just my 2 cents.
[3:51:42] Christofuhr: The one thing about this expansion I think they've really gotten wrong is the covenant system. I get why they did it but giving players the grind to upgrade and use all the convents would have been a massive boost in content @Towelliee
[3:51:51] Skizzurp: u leveling another pally?

[3:52:17] A_Klimas: if only they had the foresight to allow wfh to behin with
[3:52:23] Rudric_Ice: Blizzcon stuff would have happened
[3:52:26] swordart_19: @zalimah jaded toxic attention seeking boomer get grip obsessed with what you don't like ez block
[3:52:28] A_Klimas: it was always a hard now before covid
[3:52:31] kaihole: People keep saying "Well FF14 went through covid as well and they did fine"
[3:52:40] A_Klimas: hard no*
[3:52:46] FURL_: i think it was confirmed that they had to take out 20% of 9.1 content. inorder to make end of June release
[3:52:55] Starlaxy: if it was treated seriously to begin with...
[3:53:10] zalimah: @swordart_19 Obssessed? ive been here for like 15min lol just seeing what the patch looks like :)
[3:53:17] hydraponix: whats wfh?
[3:53:20] Christofuhr: I get that Covid was a thing but a lot of other developers have flourished during Covid - Even other games under Activision - Why did the WoW team really struggle under Covid?

[3:53:37] hydraponix: ahh gotcha
[3:53:42] TexValhalla: i don't think FF14 had a expansion drop during the pandemic though? so i don't think that is SUPER fair to say
[3:53:58] Streamcrush: this year was pretty barren for big releases
[3:54:04] Christofuhr: Yeah new games are behind but existing titles have done very well
[3:54:10] A_Klimas: blizz has NEVER been a studio that allowed working from home
[3:54:35] TexValhalla: i dunno this october at least is looking pretty damn packed imo
[3:54:37] coffeeatm: @Towelliee FF14 patch 3 bosses .
[3:54:38] Action989: I think the covenant nerfs were what pushed me back to FFXIV
[3:55:13] quakegoogl: draRage PopCorn
[3:55:40] kyshen3: ...... ESO released a expansion from home...so eya
[3:55:47] kyshen3: ESO literally created Blackwood from home.

[3:56:07] metavahn231: lol they just sell store shit
[3:56:20] mikejames01: its like 30 hours or less play time
[3:56:22] Rudric_Ice: ESO is like an indie game now
[3:56:47] SlackerSlack017: but its bad to use the same excuse should 9.1 "failed" to meet expectations though
[3:56:50] TexValhalla: i'm extremely excited for lost ark personally
[3:56:51] Bonedit: are u more excited for new world or ashes?
[3:57:00] FURL_: just wait. everyone is going to love the mega-dungeon and the raid and all will be well... 3 weeks.
[3:57:06] kyshen3: Maybe even more, their alpha is nice.
[3:57:21] kyshen3: True ... 9.2 is probably very very late fall or winter away anyways so you got plenty of time bro.
[3:57:25] Christofuhr: I honestly think a lot of the discontent has arisen from just the 0 communication. If Ion came out and was super open about where they were at. Gave us a bi-weekly update on what they were doing MOST players would be super understanding and would feel good to be let in on the process
[3:57:29] ChuckNurrish: Skull n Bonez
[3:57:36] KragnosWoW: lost ark isnt a new game?
[3:57:43] kyshen3: Well new to us..
[3:57:44] Nokterian: Lost Ark is fucking great
[3:57:44] TexValhalla: yeah lost ark looks extrememly good
[3:57:49] Action989: Going to play D2 at all?
[3:57:54] kyshen3: Lost Ark is EXTREMELY good
[3:57:55] stealth2100: no valheim?
[3:57:56] Streamcrush: I don't get Lost Ark's appeal
[3:57:56] Nokterian: the combat,the visuals, the sound
[3:58:04] bolochung: 9.1 is just filler for me until lost ark
[3:58:05] kyshen3: Ive played RU for 4 months and Lost Ark is fucking incredible.
[3:58:07] KragnosWoW: oh i thought it was a brand new game
[3:58:09] Streamcrush: looks like a multiplayer Diablo
[3:58:15] ryanc1124: ashes of creation
[3:58:16] TexValhalla: it's an mmo lol

[3:58:31] kyshen3: Plus the combat is FUCKING SUPERB!
[3:58:32] KragnosWoW: it looks dope
[3:58:40] kyshen3: Literally some of the best combat around.
[3:58:41] TexValhalla: yeah it looks crazy cool

[4:36:40] zechetto: Might not
[4:36:49] kyshen3: I just don't see how they're gonna do that when they could barely get this out the door.
[4:36:53] nixxy_7: might not... bc nobody will care of 9.3 if 10.0 comes in a few months

[4:38:06] kyshen3: Blizzard plans to hold a “global event” sometime in early 2022 that will include “smaller in-person gatherings.”
[4:38:28] konmenos: wouldn't that mean that we should have a ptr out in... one month?
[4:38:28] tocu: what if they dropped a trailer at the game awards to mix it up ?
[4:38:29] Keyastaron_: oooof

[4:39:39] nixxy_7: it wouldve been content at least
[4:39:42] kyshen3: I dunno, just the thought of them working on 10.0 from home worries me....
[4:39:54] A_Klimas: it'd be like when soda did a feature at blizzcon then went on a public rant about not getting OW beta lol
[4:40:40] nixxy_7: Yes most companies send you to do a free TEST > to see if you can come back to work after at least 2 weeks vacation
[4:40:43] kyshen3: I would also assume working from home is nice right now.
[4:40:45] Merely_Cry: you can't MAKE people vaccinate themselves, you always have an option to show negative covid test right?
[4:40:51] mrsolo0: in my country you will not be allowed to come to work unless u get ur shot
[4:40:53] kyshen3: But you can't make ppl vaxx either...

[4:59:36] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee This is from the Chronicle books ... Chronicle says Azeroth has the potential to be the greatest weapon in the known universe able of destroying the whole cosmos. Azeroth is the strongest titan world soul to have ever existed. It's theorized that her power alone could defeat the Void Lords. That's why everyone is after her power.
[4:59:38] Quimby54: It'd be pretty cool to know we're in over our heads. Almost happened with Arthas and Argus.

[5:01:12] Keyastaron_: "Stay Close Maw Walker
[5:01:13] Griff_666: Any tips for a new streamer?
[5:01:14] nixxy_7: its like north pole

[5:02:05] arlog111: maybe its were dragons go when they die
[5:02:22] nixxy_7: Not true
[5:02:25] Keyastaron_: i think our artifacts will be used again in 10.0
[5:02:26] uldrey: would be cool if the shadowlands get's dragd to our reality xD
[5:02:30] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:02:30] Ezekyler: dragons
[5:02:30] nixxy_7: bc Yseria came into the shadowlands
[5:02:32] nixxy_7: after she ded
[5:02:33] Sadisticmedic: Dragon Isles has been in Work in Progress since BFA per a GM i know
[5:02:43] TexValhalla: bro nzoth is 100% alaive
[5:02:45] Griff_666: Any tips for a new streamer?
[5:02:49] PercivalH: will sylvanas die this patch you think
[5:02:53] zechetto: I thought old gods couldnt even die, you just banish them
[5:03:04] nixxy_7: so that kinda states that all SOULS even dragons end up in shadowlands after death... otherwise yseria being in shadowlands after death beats the point
[5:03:04] Keyastaron_: or in 9.2 get our artifact power FROM THE SWORD and use it on the jailer
[5:03:04] TexValhalla: that shit was way too quick and easy for him to be involvolved just to die like that LUL

[5:03:09] soth_klf: Nzoth and the Jailer vs the rest of the world
[5:03:12] MetalManGG: it'll be like endgame, we lose, but go back in time to undo all the damage
[5:03:15] Bixster: our lord a saviour nzoth will save us
[5:03:15] KragnosWoW: shadowlands will end with all of us waking up from some dream
[5:03:18] Ensanee: ofcourse
[5:03:24] Matty_L1: you wanting some avengers endgame shit to happen
[5:03:24] Reydien: if n'zoth comes back, then anyone can come brack. bring back varian, nefarion, g'huun, kil'jaeden, everyone
[5:03:25] Sadisticmedic: Yes , of course
[5:03:47] Ensanee: isnt there some type of theory like that. called the grandfather theory
[5:03:49] nixxy_7: i can see that reference as a plot
[5:04:00] Sadisticmedic: Per the TVN that would of made an Nexus
[5:04:05] Exxcar: Hello Time paradox
[5:04:05] Keyastaron_: there always must be a threat in azeroth Kappa
[5:04:07] Ensanee: grandfather paradox*
[5:04:11] Griff_666: First time in 9.1 content?
[5:04:14] soth_klf: Kill Hitler
[5:04:19] Minifurnace: Cause if you fail in killing him he'll be even more evil growing up knowing ppl wana kill him
[5:04:21] nixxy_7: Yes he didnt die
[5:04:24] Shongoshi: is time a thing in shadowlands to be able to travel through it?
[5:04:30] nixxy_7: Nzoth just enters our minds and gives us visions
[5:04:35] nixxy_7: so its not stated he actually died
[5:04:37] KragnosWoW: we all wake up from emerald nightmare and shadowlands never happened
[5:04:40] h_u_r_k_: N'zoth is the jailer Kappa
[5:04:45] TexValhalla: bruh us killing nzoth could have so easily been a vision, he was there for a patch and then died? nah fuck no he alive lol
[5:04:49] fluffk1n: old gods dont die unless they die in they're realm azeroth isnt there realm
[5:04:51] Detonite: I watched "Any Given Sunday" yesterday, great movie btw :)
[5:04:53] Rudric_Ice: arthas and illidan comes back Pog
[5:05:01] nixxy_7: nzoth can control people an dminds and even add illusions because his weak... so its not even 5% sure he ded... its more likely he put a vision of us seeing him dead
[5:05:08] nixxy_7: its his main power of illusion and control mind
[5:05:13] soth_klf: OldGodForge Weapons
[5:05:14] h_u_r_k_: i think arthas will be the key to the jailers fall
[5:05:16] nixxy_7: They cant be killed
[5:05:28] nixxy_7: when they pulled 1 of the old god from the earth> they wounded the azeroth
[5:05:32] nixxy_7: from the lore
[5:05:39] nixxy_7: so they cant pull the other gods only contain
[5:05:45] nixxy_7: otherwise azeroth dies
[5:05:48] nixxy_7: exactly
[5:05:51] Exxcar: They can die, but it takes a tremendous amount of power
[5:06:04] nixxy_7: they kinda embeded into azeroth soo rooted and deep if they pull it like yshaarj
[5:06:09] nixxy_7: they will kill the world
[5:06:16] nixxy_7: it cant survive another old god pull
[5:06:23] Schnubbers: they just have tendrils deep into the world so killing them causes insane amout of dmg to the world
[5:06:28] nixxy_7: its like trying to pull out a slime glued to the earth
[5:06:29] Exxcar: Oh @Towelliee this is the quest I was talking about
[5:06:31] Schnubbers: and a tremendous wound
[5:06:34] Nehcrom: We have to sacrifice our covenant powers to seal him :P
[5:06:36] Exxcar: Listen to what this guy says
[5:06:45] Exxcar: Tal-Galamn
[5:06:45] Fathomz: Nzoth is inside the dagger now

[5:06:54] TexValhalla: just bring class halls back, i greatly feel like that's one aspect they could have kept for future expansions pretty easily
