[0:50:10] yiannoponuts: yup I was supporting you :)
[0:50:27] yiannoponuts: like stream snipers snipe you so you made a build to prevent that

[0:54:04] yiannoponuts: I just trying to get the point across, similar to yours, which is wow isnt cookie cut/should build according to your gameplay an think about all variables. my BG gear is different from like world pvp or arena gear cause im accomplishing something different
[0:54:11] icbjames: well thats the cool thing about wow right, you can play around with some cool specs and such.
[0:54:24] yOya876: Watch that weapon pop up once just to lose it to a hunter
[0:54:25] yiannoponuts: Theres no set way to play
[0:54:26] VanishSHRoguE: @Swifty Imo just look @ bis list including pvp gear, you'll laugh at amount of crit, and spell power you get something like 400-500

[9:19:14] CreatorLouis: Swifty, i thought you were crushing it from back in the day?
[9:19:49] CreatorLouis: for example.  How much do you have on your mortage?
[9:20:23] LoveIsntRealBro: Well hell, then any streamers net worth is not worth anything comparatively speaking. Given, you get paid x amount for ads and sponsors.
[9:20:24] tekudroid: future and potential income is ofc not counted
[9:20:26] CreatorLouis: @love_isnt_real_bro that's a form of income. not net worth.

[9:23:55] holymonke: if you are drake and you could "potienally" make 3m from a nike ad that is pending. to most creditors thats already money in bank cause its drake
[9:23:57] LoveIsntRealBro: Is Net worth really just money you have on backup ???
[9:24:07] LoveIsntRealBro: I thought it included the money you made
[9:24:24] nickcollins2210: thats cap @CreatorLouis
[9:24:27] rockybogun: Sydney is one of most xpensive places in the world
[9:24:41] CreatorLouis: correct.
[9:24:44] CreatorLouis: It's nuts here.
[9:24:59] nickcollins2210: 2.5million is the cheapest you can buy?
[9:25:12] ivebeentrollin: how old are you swifty?
[9:25:13] CreatorLouis: yeah.
[9:25:16] Drakeena: Net worth is the value of all assets, minus the total of all liabilities. Put another way, net worth is what is owned minus what is owed
[9:25:17] CreatorLouis: It's like that in Sydney
[9:25:23] mastiaz: I live in Ukraine and my apartment with 2 rooms cost like 45.000$

[9:25:56] CreatorLouis: nah, i'm talking decent Sydney. Not crapy sydney.
[9:25:56] holymonke: net worth = "the total wealth of an individual, company, or household, taking account of all financial assets and liabilities." sometimes that includes money you are "making" with your current assets. depends on bank/creditor though
[9:25:59] LoveIsntRealBro: You make 5.5k a month JUST from subs. Not including your rental house you claimed, ads, sponsors, etc. And you need help on your mortgage?

[11:28:07] ZowiezoTV: its a form of cheating
[11:28:13] hello_karma_: terrible take
[11:28:18] holymonke: yeah wsg with no end timer
[11:28:26] Macka39: depends on the exploit I guess.  If its just funny, I don't care, but if you get an advantage, that's no good.
[11:28:28] koyoshii: YEAHBUT7TV
[11:28:32] tamilveeran: I agree with Swifty, the game is expected to be played under conditions, if people violate those conditions , then all cheating should be allowed
[11:28:37] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[11:29:04] Pole91: yeah in BG its anoying, remember the exploit in WSG back in the day when you took the flag then you dropt of the WSG map like you where under it and never could be killed
[11:29:04] realDonPanini: To be honesty jumping on top of the entrances to the bases isnt much of an exploit. It's the only way WSG doesnt just turn into a turtle game.
[11:29:39] x_EGZODYA_x: death grip him down
[11:29:42] tamilveeran: Its like the top of Stables in AB. You can defend the flag and never get attacked
[11:29:47] x_EGZODYA_x: GlitchCat
[11:30:07] holymonke: they did make the bg expecting people to "cap" the flag instead of hiding and turtling. both are strats tho for sure. i guess it is just so hard to break the turtle in classic
