[0:20:48] heymomimonttv: i hit 1800 on enh in solos last night. easiest push i've ever had and i feel i still have room to push for the first time
[0:20:54] emergencxyz: forgot how they used to just talk to you and fix your problem
[0:21:03] heymomimonttv: and it's also crazy that 1800 on enh puts me at #232 lmao
[0:21:08] wallzzie: question! There is a 2h staff i see mages wearing that sheathes the same as a 1h, do you by chance know the name of it? lol
[0:21:09] EVgaming: Nice, it's a good game
[0:22:03] zachgamegodx: hey @venruki i am very disappointed in frost, after learning to do damage and live, people let me free cast and no matter what i do i cant do lethal dmg
[0:22:14] zachgamegodx: to the meta melee
[0:22:24] heymomimonttv: i have that same experience on frost rn
[0:22:35] Mydragon: does earthen reduce the healing a fw does
[0:22:36] zachgamegodx: i swapped to arcane and without an idea of what i was doing, i was killing people with just arcane missles
[0:22:43] heymomimonttv: even free casting top dps i still cant kill anything
[0:23:01] wallzzie: no i got 8 ads! LOL
[0:23:11] Shirey12: Off topic, I hope they do something cool with Affliction. Kalamazi made good points on it. UA being 1 target. Siphon Life required for Malefic Raptures (more dots more damage), Dread Touch/Doom Blossom being a choice between single target or AoE. I hope Soul Harvester(Hero Talent) helps it a bunch. It's my favorite spec and class of WoW.
[0:23:18] driftwood_tc: sending that meatball pogg
[0:23:41] heymomimonttv: i hit a dk with a 417k ele blast last night
[0:23:48] zachgamegodx: i am but like, whenever i end up getting a big one, rogue cloaks, or my winters chill gets cleaned
[0:23:50] zachgamegodx: its really frustrating
[0:24:46] heymomimonttv: the fact that fw wont kill the totems trapping him over there is wild haha
[0:25:12] Lasolz: @Shirey12 Biggest problem with aff is that when the spec is really good, the game is miserable for everyone else BibleThump
[0:25:30] gelens1: KEKW
[0:25:32] KralHor: pathetic game :D
[0:25:36] hooqs: lmao
[0:25:37] Fixit_cat: ScammaZ
[0:25:39] notdustinx: 5 arena wins 8 points ahahahahahaha
[0:25:40] Hobblefoot: I am starting to regain my love of Disc Priest. Not sure. Maybe something finally clicking with me.
[0:25:42] grimmjowhd: bro
[0:25:48] Shirey12: @Lasolz Agreed, but the button bloat and gameplay feels bad
[0:25:50] Phreshbrew: at least the fistweaver lost rating lmao i guess
[0:25:59] bruce_t_wayne: hey ven, whaazz would like to play he is practicing ret rn. i thought you might be down
[0:26:00] KralHor: 2v2 means 60 minimal
[0:26:00] heymomimonttv: meaniwhile dps gets more rating
[0:26:01] liquidsmoke666: Thank you blizz haha
[0:26:03] heymomimonttv: for less wins
[0:26:08] CabinetMistake: healer mmr is fine naowhCringe
[0:26:09] grimmjowhd: thats actually ridiculous, the enemy healer was within 30 rating of you
[0:26:22] cashewdad: the warrior had more rating than you, less wins and got more points
[0:26:26] liquidsmoke666: Balanced
[0:26:32] Symo85: evening sir
[0:26:43] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man
[0:26:45] Onshuffle: i wonder why healers dont want to queue

[0:28:25] Hobblefoot: @venruki Do you have any other entertainment guilty pleasures?  Movies, Books, Games, etc?
[0:28:35] heymomimonttv: bigdam's build
[0:28:35] Schwenkyytv: lava lash

[0:30:21] driftwood_tc: Destro and DH gamer now are we Ven? FeelsWeirdMan
[0:30:28] heymomimonttv: you'd get insta queues at enh :D
[0:30:43] heymomimonttv: ret pally is #2 most popular dps so long queues
[0:30:50] heymomimonttv: enh is least played specs so almost instant
[0:30:57] heymomimonttv: i had 4 queues yesterday sub 1 minute on enh
[0:31:21] notdustinx: solo Q is based on class representation?!
[0:31:38] ezmoney3434: do you like Elvis music?

[0:52:47] heymomimonttv: oh i had no idea
[0:52:54] heymomimonttv: thats good to know then ill try that today
[0:53:01] heymomimonttv: might be the game changer i need lol
[0:53:04] Badasti: @heymomimonttv dragons, destruction locks, other enhance shamans, demon hunters, mm hunters etc - all capable of doing the same or more burst than frost mages though?
[0:53:42] heymomimonttv: @Badasti i can usually beat dev before they beat me, i can beat up a lock no prob. mm hunter is dicey, and DH isnt too bad

[0:54:11] CabinetMistake: same
[0:54:11] Badasti: @heymomimonttv yeah but your argument was that frost mages kill you in stuns, mages dont have stuns, so any of those classes would kill you in the same stun
[0:54:13] CabinetMistake: i was like wtf
[0:54:23] crymorre: Cuz what else are you gonna do
[0:54:31] crymorre: That's why they charge that much
[0:54:36] boundric: invest in an air compressor
[0:54:39] heymomimonttv: @Badasti frost mage def has a stun, but alot of time i was set up with a hoj from hpal
[0:54:41] W00dyyx: We are running out of air

[0:57:06] NovaSun84: I can just imagine people in highrise skyscrapers "inhaling" fresh air.  What a wild time to be alive.
[0:57:11] threespicytacos: barbArrive
[0:57:30] ramenxo: they will trinket a root first global, press blur into nothing, die behind pillar and flame u for bein shit 100% guaranteed
[0:57:31] crymorre: Next thing they will have aged air like wine vintages
[0:58:33] Dopplebok: Sell air bottled out of my crawl space. One of a kind
[0:58:49] whensmoko: have you been to banff ven?
[0:58:57] wallzzie: i just leveled the mage, what you think for a beginner for mage, arcane or frost easier to get a hang of in pvp?
[0:59:17] CabinetMistake: is the glacial spike build good?
[0:59:19] Zenfuzz: frost is a ton of fun
[0:59:22] CabinetMistake: or preferable
[0:59:25] Badasti: id def say frost to get used to the class
[0:59:25] crymorre: Bring a few mason jars and bottle some air while you're up there, can sniff it for free later
[0:59:31] CabinetMistake: awesome
[0:59:32] Badasti: arcane has quite a learning curve
[0:59:41] mackjbish: shaman ele "casting" = hex
[0:59:41] Zenfuzz: glacial more fun to me with shimmer
[0:59:43] MacGeown: For me frost is easier for a beginner I started PVP on that
[0:59:51] zerx_gg: arcane isnt as hard as people make it out to be
[0:59:53] wallzzie: thanks, i love how arcane looks but understand i'm watching the GOAT play.. lol
[1:00:08] zerx_gg: Yes
[1:00:15] bruce_t_wayne: what do you think they could do to make arcane less toxic?
[1:00:21] TehWarlock21: I just find arcane to be very intimidating tbh
[1:00:42] ramenxo: if i played anything besides sv hunter i would I need a break from fixing this script for a coworker
[1:00:43] Badasti: I dont agree, I've found both fire and frost way easier, and I'm higher rated on both specs even though arcane is better
[1:00:46] zachgamegodx: @bruce_t_wayne play a demon hiunter
[1:00:53] bruce_t_wayne: xdd
[1:00:54] ramenxo: told me it would be an easy friday task its over 1000 lines of incorrectly formatted redundant code
[1:01:08] TehWarlock21: I really want to try arcane, idc if it's for pve or pvp, it's the class with the prettiest effects lol, but it just seems so complex
[1:01:10] sotirios2000: imagine you are in a dark alley and babooshka is behind you
[1:01:13] heymomimonttv: arcane spellsteal stealing ulti penni shield is nutty to me
[1:01:41] ramenxo: babooshka looks like a dad let his daughters dress him up for a valentines day party
[1:01:43] henorist97: why you dont play sod?:D
[1:01:43] NovaSun84: TehWarlock21 Only way to experience it is to try.  It's free to respec right?
[1:01:46] heymomimonttv: the only way arcane functions is ??? lmao
[1:01:49] ATHLTE: this axtins post?
[1:01:52] heymomimonttv: cut off mid sentence

[1:02:26] zerx_gg: simple
[1:02:58] Magottx: i actually want to enjoy SoD but its just so Resident
[1:03:00] TehWarlock21: @NovaSun84 true, I'll have to read a lot and get flamed for a bit
[1:03:10] elijahcrow: I liked arcane in Legion. Good sign is I don't remember much of either loving or hating any part of it. It just felt natural to me then, I guess.
[1:03:15] henorist97: why u dont play sod? 😀😁
[1:03:20] ellisrainy: ANOTHER POST ANOTHER REACTION LETS GO
[1:03:34] zerx_gg: ellis got bills to pay

[1:03:53] ramenxo: ferals will never be happy until they get claws of shirvallah instant cast clones useable in cat form back and can do most cleave, most single target, 1 shot with convoke, rot entire team and press barkskin and be immune to a nuclear blast

[1:04:27] ellisrainy: WANNA HEAR A FUN STORY
[1:04:36] Badasti: @ramenxo I dunno man, have you tried Feral? It feels really clunky. I'd be happy if the spec wasnt built around having to cast clone to do dam
[1:04:50] elijahcrow: uh oh
[1:04:52] ellisrainy: my doc thinks i have a stress fracture in my leg (getting xray next week) and im not allowed to train again
[1:04:58] ellisrainy: i swear bro im just getting chain injured

[1:06:05] ellisrainy: actually no idea, i think it's just cause the leg thing i had surgery for last year went on for so long and it created a bunch of imbalances
[1:06:14] ellisrainy: should be fine soon but damn i just wanna lift heavy circles :(
[1:06:34] ellisrainy: wild how u get 1 bad injury and it just messes u up
[1:06:38] Magottx: if you gave yourself a stress fracture from imbalances that is wild lol
[1:06:44] elijahcrow: Too much trauma in one site.
[1:07:22] splex: good song for the chaos
[1:07:22] Yanari_x: i hate this zoo owner type of gameplay
[1:07:36] zerx_gg: nerf frost mage
[1:07:38] addyz0r: Whazz is having ping problems Kappa
[1:07:38] ellisrainy: @Magottx yeah just stuff like running + weight training over time with a lot of imbalance. my bones are also made of jelly hahah
[1:08:29] Badasti: need to poly into the selfie cam Pika style
[1:08:35] Zenfuzz: can we see druid death log? seems he died at like 30%
[1:08:39] Magottx: @ellisrainy i feel you, i have "lax joints' so i get tendonitis and ligament issues often
[1:08:54] zerx_gg: frost bomb + glacial crits i think Zenfuzz
[1:09:06] heymomimonttv: haha wait what is this mog
[1:09:07] heymomimonttv: i love it
[1:09:11] heymomimonttv: i gotta see the front
[1:09:16] ellisrainy: yeah I think I'm just gonna have to spend this year focussing on actually rebuilding everything instead of rushing back into my usual training
[1:09:20] Zenfuzz: @zerx_gg ahhh, didnt see the frost bomb
[1:09:23] Magottx: its cause tendons gow at like 1/10th the rate muscles do so they start failing as you get stronger
[1:09:40] Magottx: chill chill
[1:09:56] ellisrainy: jokes on u im roided to the gills m8
[1:09:59] addyz0r: is there a way to train tendons?
[1:10:03] Zenfuzz: get some peptides
[1:10:09] futurelooksgood: this might be anacdotal, but is that why it seems like i have seen alot of people trying more reps at smaller wieghts?
[1:10:11] Zenfuzz: i think its like bpc 157 or something like that
[1:10:17] Magottx: haha i now im jokin. but kettle bells and stuff is good for that stuff,
[1:10:29] Magottx: we do rotations of eccentrics and isos also to help it
[1:11:18] Magottx: @futurelooksgood yea thats a lot less taxing on your body
[1:12:34] gelatokush: ive been using the Francis Ngannou Sand mines method to stay in shape for the past decade, works great
[1:12:46] zerx_gg: ret had his nikes on
[1:14:02] Zenfuzz: training heavy is better for you
[1:14:16] Locturnal_TV: now that im in my 30s ive shifted to training for longevity.
[1:14:27] Salanzo: and also your definition of 'better for you'
[1:14:35] Zenfuzz: 70-85% of max
[1:14:37] fungames: Me too lol
[1:14:49] Zenfuzz: if the muscles and bones dont stress, they dont adapt
[1:15:54] zerx_gg: i dont think going healer is the play
[1:16:10] Acurarx: young bucks be all into the weightlifting gymbro life, the. hit 40 and look like a refrigerator cuz they don’t maintain it anymore. Do what is best, effective, and sustainable for YOU.
[1:16:18] Badasti: hey Ven, on Evoker is there any reason you wouldnt use Tip the Scales and Dragonrage at the same time?
[1:16:25] zerx_gg: young bucks xdd
[1:16:26] Elbandiv: retail looks not like wow imo
[1:16:32] addyz0r: Running to heal up is the play (0 rating opinion)
[1:16:51] Badasti: ah, good to know, thanks
[1:16:56] Magman8: Which Mage spec do you think has highest DMG in Rbgs?

[1:17:15] addyz0r: the world doesnt look like the 1950s anymore. Things change XD
[1:17:22] lil_doreo: thought's on casual players getting into arena? worth or nah
[1:17:22] heymomimonttv: @Elbandiv gotta take off the nostalgia glasses and accept that times change and we all grow :) including wow lol
[1:17:24] mantibor1: classic andys here
[1:17:27] Elbandiv: no ur char looks like a fortnite champ
[1:17:30] Zenfuzz: @Acurarx studies show the older you get, the more your bones and joints NEED  weightlifting. May not be as heavy as it once was. but thats why 70-85% is solid because the % doesnt change, just the weight
[1:17:36] Click_for_giggles: salmon brine in orange juice y/n?
[1:17:46] Tyferious: no
[1:17:51] snacks_23: how a game dont look like a game when it is the game? lol

[1:39:56] zerx_gg: would you prefer Luighy or Luijy
[1:40:18] StromicusRex: one of our supervisor's son cleans and he's fcking amazing, but idk if i could stomach hiring someone i know to clean my apt after i move out pepeLaugh
[1:40:21] Luigicamp: or what that Starbucks guy wrote on my cup once Loueegee
[1:40:24] StromicusRex: i'd never be able to look him in the eye again
[1:40:26] cadillacseville: its like the eminem version of supatese
[1:40:28] mindrazor: I only come here for the vocals.

[1:40:45] zerx_gg: god damn
[1:40:51] Maxom1: they getting farmed
[1:40:52] Luigicamp: @zerx_gg indeed lol
[1:40:52] IrishEthics: on a lobby you thought would be trash
[1:40:54] chubmax: christ im so bad at lock.  i cant do dmg under pressure
[1:40:55] StromicusRex: @Luigicamp my friend is changing their name but wanted to keep the "Lu" part of their name. i tried to get her to pick Luigi but she refused
[1:40:56] ayosteviey: Damn so many destros owning lately its making me want to go to the darkside
[1:41:14] bobbybigbuxx: NGL the warrior and pally names are sus to be in the same lobby
[1:41:16] LoveStruck27: ret hunter is going to be tough if they focus you?
[1:41:27] ayosteviey: Its darkside for me cause I only play melle classes lol
[1:41:27] Acrcus: What do you mean?
[1:41:28] bruce_t_wayne: thats fair
[1:41:29] IrishEthics: you have to be good at faking
[1:41:32] zerx_gg: Couldnt care less pal
[1:41:36] IrishEthics: if you dont cast you dont do a ton of dmg
[1:41:36] Onshuffle: destro is ethical
[1:41:39] mindrazor: Nah, it's clean clean.
[1:41:40] ramenxo: the fact u can just spam ur execute regardless of HP is a little sus, and ur portals do the most damage in the universe and ignore los is pretty unethical
[1:41:40] cruelhabbitts: agreed
[1:41:44] fistweaveurnan: it is unethical, rift and freedom port amongst other things make it such
[1:41:50] knadam13: destro has always been ethically chaotic
[1:42:02] ferahgok: The Purple classes hold the mantle for the best caster and best melee in the game imo
[1:42:04] orcrimmar: this song always reminds me of the Lord of War movie
[1:42:05] ramenxo: destro is chaotic neutral
[1:42:15] Luigicamp: @StromicusRex The problem with that is to be ready to an lifetime of endless Mario questions and jokes. Even the doordash people while waiting to pick up my orders they txt me through the apps asking if I am the guy from the video game....
[1:42:21] ferahgok: Purple = Win
[1:42:27] StromicusRex: LOL
[1:42:32] siouxuhcide: jimmi or stevie ray?

[1:42:39] Luigicamp: lol
[1:42:52] zerx_gg: we musta save-a da princess
[1:43:03] StromicusRex: you should just lean into it
[1:43:04] Luigicamp: LuL
[1:43:10] Hobblefoot: You are correct.  Did you see Destro Lock's rate of being targeted as the kill target. They are #1 by a mile.  That by itself make their spec (even if super strong) fine right now all things considered. @venruki
[1:43:19] siouxuhcide: jimmi or stevie ray?
[1:43:24] Luigicamp: I usually play along, it's either that or come across as a D lol
[1:43:24] stilljane: your food just sitting there getting so cold
[1:43:26] marvin1995xo: yes cause destro is fun and not so toxic
[1:43:27] chubmax: 67% first blood
[1:43:30] bobbybigbuxx: if you are having fun, and its wow, chances are its not ethical
[1:43:33] bruce_t_wayne: ez 6:0 lets go
[1:43:35] StromicusRex: he has no respect for your efforts smh @stilljane
[1:43:42] stilljane: @StromicusRex fr SMH
[1:43:46] Maxom1: wat about double destro then
[1:43:48] s3izur3s: @chubmax is destro lock / lock first blood 67% of time?
[1:43:49] zerx_gg: warm blueberries Pog
[1:43:50] siouxuhcide: 5-1 inc
[1:43:51] Hobblefoot: You can play Destro one-handed come on now
[1:43:54] StromicusRex: homemade brekky >>>>> SS
[1:44:04] chubmax: @s3izur3s destro is.  aff demo like 50% or less
[1:44:09] wackpoetic: breakfast always tastes better with a fat dub on the side
[1:44:11] Luigicamp: technically it's food delivery, it's supposed to be cold Kappa
[1:44:15] chubmax: i wish aff was good
[1:44:16] stilljane: idk wtf happened while i was making that breakfast too but it looks like a bomb went off in this kitchen yo
[1:44:38] zerx_gg: Luigi knows someone stilljane dont worry
[1:44:38] StromicusRex: were you high? that usually happens in my kitchen when i cook while high Kapp
[1:44:44] ATHLTE: LUL
[1:44:59] Hobblefoot: Get those immolates out there! Come on! Secure that 6-0
[1:45:01] stilljane: @StromicusRex lmfao no just my wacko brain
[1:45:07] orcrimmar: @stilljane if your kitchen doesn't look like that after cooking, you didn't do it right
[1:45:20] StromicusRex: or you're a professional chef
[1:45:21] s3izur3s: @chubmax which is odd since destro is the stronger spec of the 3
[1:45:24] StromicusRex: no in between
[1:45:26] zerx_gg: i have two housemates my kitchen always looks like shit
[1:45:29] Luigicamp: lol
[1:45:44] bruce_t_wayne: unlucky
[1:45:47] bobbybigbuxx: KEKW
[1:45:49] StromicusRex: thats what you get for picking SS over brekky
[1:45:50] stilljane: rip
[1:45:53] stilljane: karma!
[1:45:56] stilljane: jk
[1:46:03] R1klus: Would you say lock is easier in shuffle than mage atm?
[1:46:06] chubmax: @s3izur3s destro cant be allowed to free cast most of the time.  aff gets off their dmg no matter what
[1:46:09] Hobblefoot: So close to a 6-0.... I was ready for you bringing the thunder there ... Bummer.
[1:46:14] chubmax: @venruki try aff
[1:46:15] northlanexyz: Can i have autographv

[1:46:47] CabinetMistake: i want to see it
[1:46:48] Hobblefoot: Destro is my favorite spec now followed by Surv, Outlaw, Disc
[1:47:09] stealthwalker99: I kill every succubus
[1:47:09] skylightxo: @venruki How many physical fights have you been in, in your life?
[1:47:14] Lemurion1: i mostly use vs double melee to get them fuck off me
[1:47:15] Hobblefoot: I never use it. Hate the cast. LOL  But I bet it is so good.
[1:47:35] s3izur3s: @venruki do they use the pet or the command demon ability with sac?
[1:47:42] zerx_gg: damn over 20 years ago
[1:48:01] northlanexyz: Better step into the arena if you urge to fight

[2:10:37] Luigicamp: thick patties are ok if you don't fill up the rest of the burger with layers of stuff
[2:10:41] Fixit_cat: If you can't eat it without a knife, burger abomination
[2:10:44] soddi: i guess if it's quality meat, some like the middle of the patty medium cooked
[2:10:45] StromicusRex: highly recommend
[2:10:51] Wrathbb1: at the end of the day you are getting a ground beef patty at a sit down restaurant its kind of insane

[2:16:20] zerx_gg: yo i got suspended on twitter wtf
[2:16:26] soddi: this match could happen in an elevator
[2:16:33] absterge: fistweaver mains and the dev who makes fistweaver, hope they just wake up everyday with a stiff neck, but not enough to ruin their whole day or cause pain, just enough to be an annoyance throughout the day
[2:16:35] StromicusRex: musk hates you confirmed
[2:16:37] Luigicamp: @zerx_gg what did you do, and don't say nothing!

[2:38:47] s3izur3s: SEDUCE
[2:38:55] ferahgok: @2prac It's a bonus on an "Infurious" piece that you craft. NOT a separate embellishment that you buy on the AH.

[2:39:58] nameyourform: ggs
[2:40:21] peeachy8: @ferahgok Bummer I thought it was separate buff too
[2:40:24] Badasti: I guess you could just keep the pet on passive and use pettattack arena1-3 + seduce arena1-3 macros
[2:40:44] Badasti: probably out of line, was the pet on him?
[2:40:46] likeewlock: seduce is cast
[2:40:48] jporter_: your succ is too close i think
[2:41:17] 2prac: @ferahgok Ty :D
[2:41:24] peeachy8: quick question on that. the cloth infurius feet have that as well. does it get over written by incog?

[2:42:54] SuperSunBros64: kinda crazy blizz hasnt implemented something like reflex into pvp ui just like recent matches or something
[2:43:28] wackpoetic: what happens if you sac it
[2:43:29] Badasti: doesnt the cd reset if you resummon the pet or some shit? or is that just for kick and pet kick
[2:43:53] Locturnal_TV: i think chan has a weakaura that shows when your pet is casting the seduce. really helpful
[2:43:53] peeachy8: let's see if my pc recorded it. it was very frustrating.

[2:45:39] StromicusRex: attackt
[2:45:41] Badasti: whats this guy attaching his pet to
[2:45:47] StromicusRex: the enemy, duh
[2:46:15] Badasti: instead of attacking the pet wraps its arms around the enemies legs? LUL
[2:46:23] StromicusRex: yeah
[2:46:27] buffevoker: Ven still no patch notes this might be the end
[2:46:31] StromicusRex: it just holds on for dear life
[2:46:40] Badasti: "buckle up buckaroos"
[2:46:44] stealthwalker99: he plays that for double cs though
[2:46:47] stealthwalker99: double cs is nasty
[2:47:18] dryangore: yeh the fear thing isn't as important now that they increased it baseline and nerfed the talent
[2:47:47] Badasti: managing pets... ew

[2:55:01] biofreaks: The 'Holy Trinity' (tank,dps,healer) philosophy doesnt work well in most modern games it feels like. Something is always so one sided. In WoWs case very few healers and few tanks. In OW its healers and tanks etc..curious what creative ways there are to overcome this.

[3:06:30] Badasti: it has its merits but it doesnt have arena and there are some retail things i like
[3:06:30] heymomimonttv: take the good parts of retail, none of the QoL, and add it to a 20 year old game. great!
[3:06:37] Kalakbar: is it me you're looking ~ for~
[3:06:45] Kalakbar: pretty sick actually
[3:06:45] FunnyName26: More or less true. They're just mostly retail or future expac abilities that spice up vanilla a bit
[3:06:53] Hobblefoot: I think:  Who cares. Nice to have different games appeal to different fan bases. I won't get worked up over a game I don't play.
[3:06:58] ItsBees: Sadge
[3:07:02] Kalakbar: so sick I got recommended TRT
[3:07:05] orcrimmar: People just like sod because all they have to do is spam shadowbolt/frostbolt/auto attack
[3:07:08] 13phx: sod is an entirely different experience, respectfully... comparing the two versions is ludicrous. they both offer their own flavors
[3:07:19] SteLawBro: SOD feels like a low level bg. Twinks vs non twinks. Play whats popular or have no fun.
[3:07:22] FateIRL: it sgonna be all sod
[3:07:28] Kalakbar: I had a free T of 105, with the other measurement being 5.3 out of 8-26 pepeLaugh

[3:07:54] FateIRL: hes a nerd
[3:07:58] Ignite_CLO: pretty funny ngl
[3:07:58] Kalakbar: well, i have been using opiates for about ~20~ years
[3:07:58] Badasti: which raid?
[3:07:59] Maxom1: lame
[3:08:02] Maxom1: if real
[3:08:03] heymomimonttv: i like him tbh it's funny
[3:08:04] Badasti: is it asmongold and soda etc?
[3:08:05] setbackttv: if SOD was classic with the new races and classes and transmog i'd have peeped it maybe. I already been playing since  vanilla no urge to relive
[3:08:07] Necrolancer47: what did they do to him again?
[3:08:09] ItsBees: he sucks
[3:08:17] skez_live: nothing wrong with classic with a little spice, but every time I log on and try a new rune, it just makes me want to play retail lol
[3:08:17] Maxom1: they should rez them and ban the guy
[3:08:22] SteLawBro: Did he get forgiven and they knew he was there or did he get in incognito and surprise them?
[3:08:23] salv_za: If it was just retail or whatever it's fine, but hardcore... nah
[3:08:24] wowsuomi: Should be ip banned
[3:08:34] engzyng: sounds like a psycho
[3:08:35] FateIRL: he is one with no life lol
[3:08:37] FunnyName26: He's an asshole, but a symptom of Blizzard's negligence @venruki
[3:08:38] cashewdad: He's basically the boogeyman of classic hardcore
[3:08:39] Badasti: sometimes you need villains
[3:08:39] sotirios2000: lol that s a psycho
[3:08:40] SteLawBro: Thats so hilarious. Wroong..But godamn hilarious.

[3:08:54] nikthevoker: hes got issues
[3:08:55] cerealzy: psychopath behaviour tbh
[3:08:58] wackpoetic: literal psycopath
[3:09:06] storm_chaser_ron: what is he griefing them _for_
[3:09:06] gone_wickedtv: Hey van i have a question if you play on a 12 button mouse you are disadvantaged if you have the damage attacks on the mouse the keyboard is faster ?
[3:09:07] ALLtheEXP: nah its great

[3:09:23] Maxom1: people are always gonna cross the line
[3:09:24] buffevoker: Judgement Day Lmao
[3:09:26] williwhite94: they need to banm his IP adress and he would have to move
[3:09:32] sotirios2000: is an asshole but it's because of climate change and putin
[3:09:33] Raaein: Did they know it was the same guy on the account as before?
[3:09:37] nikthevoker: you can hear it in his voice
[3:09:42] absterge: as someone who actively criticizes blizzard… how is that their fault LMAO
[3:09:44] salv_za: hella lame
[3:09:45] Locturnal_TV: reason #41023 why i will never play hc
[3:10:00] FateIRL: hc raiding is dumb
[3:10:01] SteLawBro: Just the wrong corner. Everyone makes mistakes.
[3:10:03] FateIRL: for that exact reason
[3:10:05] ALLtheEXP: worth it 100%
[3:10:05] dumbodylan: this might be a dumb question but is it better to have full conquest gear in SS or have the 4 set BiS and the rest conquest?
[3:10:06] Maxom1: they should reverse the deaths also
[3:10:08] Zercmon: didnt he get banned the first time
[3:10:09] williwhite94: on of the account he BOUGHT lol
[3:10:22] moremantella255: was just wrong corner
[3:10:24] profreshtv: LUL LUL LUL SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[3:10:25] williwhite94: he buys account to do this with lol
[3:10:28] absterge: hope this guy wakes up with a migraine every single day
[3:10:32] FunnyName26: Sure. Blizzard doesn't crack down on people who make others' gameplay worse, which allows for other assholes to act up without fearing any repercussions for bad behavior. I have no skin in the game, but that's my general take @venruki
[3:10:32] Maxom1: if its that level of grief bliz should just undo it all that way people wont try it more
[3:10:34] orcrimmar: he sounds like a loser lol
[3:10:37] wowsuomi: Hopefully forever'
[3:10:45] SteLawBro: Wow...Didnt know you can get banned for taking a wrong turn. No more learning dungeons i guess!!!!
[3:10:47] sotirios2000: @absterge thats mean lol
[3:10:50] ALLtheEXP: he's this generations Leeroy
[3:10:55] storm_chaser_ron: Why did he even do it
[3:10:55] mindrazor: Blizzard got us guys...they got you you loser...not all the guys
[3:10:58] salv_za: glad he streams so he can get caught before he griefs again
[3:11:01] kusoneko: wrong corner = ban
[3:11:05] Maxom1: perm ban tho?
[3:11:06] Kujo_XX: The ban compared to the wasted investment of a raid worth of HC is pennies
[3:11:10] wackpoetic: doesn't fit my narrative, so i'll ignore it
[3:11:10] tcyronek0: has no skin in the take yet can comment on it
[3:11:11] Maxom1: or just slap on wrist?
[3:11:12] FateIRL: they banned his main account? then its justice lol
[3:11:14] Kalakbar: @FunnyName26 interesting.  "people are bad so I'm going to be the worst I can be"
[3:11:17] timothyx000: banned by mass report?
[3:11:17] phanabananana: Supposedly he didn't get banned for the grief but for other reasons
[3:11:27] heymomimonttv: hey @absterge have you watched zoolander yet?
[3:11:28] sotirios2000: send fbi
[3:11:30] williwhite94: wrong account he has XXXX accounts he needs to BAn IP Adress not the account @venruki
[3:11:34] Kujo_XX: Oh I know, but it's an empty gesture/outcome really
[3:11:38] jporter_: what did he get banned for?
[3:11:38] Necrolancer47: wow jail!
[3:11:38] absterge: @heymomimonttv dude. DUDE
[3:11:41] ALLtheEXP: it's a vidya game, dude is kind of a jerk but I 100% find it peak entertainment from the outside looking in
[3:11:41] FateIRL: banning ip address does literally nothing
[3:11:45] Zercmon: they can prob press 1 button and revert everything plus ban him with the same button
[3:11:46] FateIRL: anyone can change it
[3:11:47] Dwilk20: He can just get an IP generator
[3:11:50] moremantella255: dude can literally change his ip address
[3:11:55] SteLawBro: @venruki How's anyone supposed to learn a dungeon if you get banned for taking a wrong turn? Could have happened to anyone.
[3:11:56] Hobblefoot: With the caveat that it is just a game:  This dude strikes me as completely pathetic and slightly sociopathic.  Even in a game, anyone that actively tries to ruin the gaming experience of others is simply a bad person.  That is all there is to it. This weird little man is just a shitty person.
[3:11:57] Sweetmat_34: jail
[3:12:01] heymomimonttv: @absterge lmfaoooo i'm gonna keep asking til you watch it. when you finally watch it youll thank me

[3:12:36] biofreaks: Lets watch it!
[3:12:39] ALLtheEXP: ALSO legendary
[3:12:40] FateIRL: that was a legendary video
[3:12:40] Badasti: i remember that too
[3:12:41] isseswagger: well...
[3:12:42] ALLtheEXP: real dick move, but amazing
[3:12:44] Badasti: that was shit
[3:12:46] Zercmon: its on a pbp server
[3:12:48] bobbybigbuxx: nothing at all
[3:12:48] Zercmon: pvp
[3:12:49] niatto07: FOR THE HORDE
[3:12:49] profreshtv: thatt was funny
[3:12:51] FateIRL: do nothing its pvp on a pvp server
[3:12:51] SteLawBro: That guild is going to have such a hard time recruiting. They are going to need id's and formal paperwork.
[3:12:54] salv_za: they should have a funeral irl
[3:12:55] WardenDOTA: that funeral became legendary because of that
[3:12:55] Kalakbar: IRL funeral gets camped as well
[3:12:55] Revan06a: @venruki it was an alliance guild.
[3:12:55] heymomimonttv: yo @venruki can you tell sterge how good zoolander is
[3:12:57] FunnyName26: Sure, ik he got banned, but how long did it take? Plus it took people to make videos on this guy being a goof for blizzard to finally notice it. And this is one situation that's observed. How many goofballs get away with stuff without getting touched
[3:12:58] sotirios2000: it was a proper funeral at least
[3:13:00] bobbybigbuxx: THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO HELLO
[3:13:01] Dwilk20: They ban people for mean words? Why not mean actions?
[3:13:01] sotirios2000: everybody dead
[3:13:05] Axtin: why would they even play with him didnt he already have a reputation for griefing naxx?
[3:13:07] Necrolancer47: Dont have a funeral in wow  xD
[3:13:09] Maxom1: they did it in contested area
[3:13:10] wallzzie: i mean, that's tough..
[3:13:12] ALLtheEXP: I also think the guy griefing in hardcore is amazing for the record @venruki  probably a minority there
[3:13:12] Maxom1: wat do u expect
[3:13:13] Raaein: It's fucked up but blizzard aren't the morality police, what they did was normal gameplay
[3:13:20] FateIRL: he bought an acct and was undercover
[3:13:24] xSoulstacex: It's an mmorpg. That was amazing and cool. They advertised on a public forum for a pvp server. Blizzard shouldnt do anything
[3:13:24] FateIRL: for months
[3:13:25] Axtin: o nice
[3:13:29] heymomimonttv: @ALLtheEXP i agree
[3:13:29] FunnyName26: Either way, I'm not dying on this hill
[3:13:31] hooqs: @Axtin he bought an account from someone and joined the raid
[3:13:31] ALLtheEXP: Bro played the long game and I think it's hilarious
[3:13:38] heymomimonttv: ^
[3:13:43] Dwilk20: Guess we know how low morals
[3:13:43] bobbybigbuxx: griefing in hardcore is top tier
[3:13:46] storm_chaser_ron: What is the guy's specific grudge with that guild though
[3:13:49] bobbybigbuxx: bc fuck everyone who plays hardcore
[3:13:51] heymomimonttv: literally that, he committed to the bit and succeeded. twice. good for him
[3:13:53] Zercmon: heres the thing they could have prevented hgetting ganked they were on a pvp server if they literally set up a line with hella people they should be able to have like security or something the guy that one shot half the raid they had no way of countering it
[3:13:59] Hobblefoot: @ALLtheEXP I don't understand a person that has this take. Why is it amazing to make people feel awful and ruin a gaming experience... let alone a tribute to a real life friend.
[3:14:04] driftwood_tc: I cant get cartman as a hall monitor out of my head when hearing this song LUL
[3:14:17] SteLawBro: Its warcraft. Not hold your friends hands and sing pretty songs craft. People are going to get hurt. Put your boots on.
[3:14:32] williwhite94: @Hobblefoot becuase they are toxic people that feed of toxic shit lmao
[3:14:33] storm_chaser_ron: rp brain
[3:14:38] ALLtheEXP: @Hobblefoot Because at the end of the day it's a video game. I'm not saying I would ever do it. I actually think it's a dick move, but...I can't help but find it top tier entertainment looking in fromt he outside.
[3:14:39] wowsuomi: The guy is a streamer and is the most unhinged crazy person
[3:14:39] StromicusRex: tabbed back in for 30 seconds and i think i'm gonna go back out again monkaS
[3:15:07] absterge: @stromicusrex wish you cared about me
[3:15:18] heymomimonttv: @ALLtheEXP exactly this. i would never do it myself and always try to make sure everyone's experience is good. but as a bystander, that shit is funny
[3:15:23] ALLtheEXP: I think I like it for the same reason I love Leeroy Jenkins fame from all those years ago
[3:15:23] JimmyBigmoney: How well are mages doing right now?
[3:15:27] StromicusRex: bro its you who dont care ignoring all my messages in here earlier smh @absterge
[3:15:49] Hobblefoot: @ALLtheEXP It is a video game played by real people trying to have a good time. So regardless of whether it is a game or not, the problem is that there is a person that gets a preverbal hard-on upsetting and hurting other people regardless of the level of hurt.
[3:15:52] ALLtheEXP: What because people decide to play it 'hardcore' it's any different than when Leeroy wiped his team? lololol
[3:15:54] WardenDOTA: why is evoker kick physical that is broken
[3:15:55] wowsuomi: You could watch Asmons take on the guy
[3:16:03] Endoraesh: insert joe clip
[3:16:16] wowsuomi: I seen it in mes's stream yesterday
[3:16:27] mnowpsn: Does bolt not do big dam anymore? Haven't played lock in ages

[3:16:39] heymomimonttv: @mnowpsn it does when ramped up
[3:16:49] mnowpsn: Ahh sweet thx
[3:17:01] mnowpsn: Thinking of destro alt

[3:18:14] salv_za: but you lose the silence
[3:18:37] heymomimonttv: @hoaylander what? why does the second bolt in a row tend to do more dmg then
[3:18:49] driftwood_tc: pepeJAM GuitarTime
[3:19:03] heymomimonttv: you get hit by 1 bolt for 190k then second bolt for 300k

[3:23:06] Maxdeath1: @mnowpsn there's like 3 in the twin cities area, I like it
[3:23:17] Varaben: i dont want to brag, but my auction of stringy wolf meat just sold
[3:23:24] mnowpsn: @maxdeath1 ok cool I'm in stillwater
[3:23:26] heymomimonttv: @hoaylander interesting, i havent played lock since s1. my healer always tells me to avoid/kick/reflect the second bolt instead of the first one cuz thats the big dmg
[3:23:35] snowfalllllll: not balanced
[3:23:36] Killshotz_24: Bruh he just LOS is healer
[3:23:42] krome2dadome: buff arcane
[3:23:46] snakefizz: that dh had a hard on for u

[3:23:48] sotirios2000: buff destro
[3:23:59] hooqs: average dh player this season
[3:23:59] leakyboots25: Triple portal and afk > full veins go
[3:23:59] obviouslytai: hmm i wonder if i should wait til seduce. NAH TRIPLE FLAME RIFT GG
[3:24:02] Raaein: Can you ground portal after it's cast
[3:24:27] mnowpsn: @heymomimonttv ur right there is a talent I looked the 2nd bolt does do more if u cast within few.seconds of 1st one
[3:24:47] heymomimonttv: @mnowpsn @hoaylander
[3:24:49] hoaylander: @mnowpsn which talent?
[3:25:15] mnowpsn: It's on wowhead I'm on mobile just check talent tree
[3:25:28] meincke_: Is it you who have have a char called babooshka?
[3:25:31] ALLtheEXP: that was incredible lol
[3:25:37] salv_za: buff dh
[3:25:37] heymomimonttv: the song and that dance for a 5-1 lmfao. love it
[3:25:49] SteLawBro: I think a group oof top WoW arena players should come together and make a game. Just Arena. Copy WoW but make it cool. Free to play, can buy transmog packs. Lessgo
[3:25:50] shikari01: do the dance again!
[3:26:03] shikari01: @SteLawBro they tried that i think
[3:26:11] hoaylander: @mnowpsn i play destro, I know the talent tree and there's no such talent
[3:26:19] shikari01: or nevermind it was a different style game
[3:26:22] meincke_: oh.. that answered itself then
[3:26:38] mnowpsn: Idk guess the talent tree I seen was outdated somehow not sure idk
[3:26:57] SteLawBro: @shikari01 Im thinking next gen engine, diablo looking characters fast paced arena.
[3:27:08] gaulois62: @venruki how do u play SP i feel like its so frustrating to play
[3:27:17] FateIRL: im sad the 4 set for destro is gone next season for a crappy one
[3:27:19] hoaylander: your mog is killing me man
[3:27:22] gregl__: rift stuff going away next season
[3:27:34] gaulois62: I really want to make it work but yea...
[3:27:36] malvarcla: or just play dh or rogue
[3:27:39] hoaylander: passive damage boost. very uninspired
[3:27:39] FateIRL: the crit on incinerate or some bs lol
[3:27:42] gregl__: season 1 tier, its like crit damage or something
[3:27:55] skez_live: those bows look so good on Babooshka
[3:27:56] AngryMatt: unfortunately I've always been an sp main and I'm a loyal ho
[3:27:57] hoaylander: probably because it was %2 better in pve and all dragonslayers voted for it :D
[3:28:06] obviouslytai: BIG BOLTS
[3:28:07] hooqs: blizzard killed season 4
[3:28:15] FateIRL: no more flame rifts or immolate generating portals
[3:28:17] FateIRL: sadge
[3:28:24] Aggro068: What is it going to be for arcane?
[3:28:26] gregl__: its blizzards fault, destro tier is the worst pve tier in the game by far
[3:28:29] obviouslytai: ikr. why not seperate pvp and pve tier. such a simple solution
[3:28:31] gregl__: its so terrible
[3:28:39] SteLawBro: I cant think of too many worse ways for them to do that....
[3:28:41] Varaben: 50% vers
[3:28:43] Cocoapuffs1: they gonna nerf stats again prob
[3:28:49] gregl__: nah its like a 3% gain
[3:28:53] gregl__: every other spec is 14-20%
[3:28:57] gregl__: its like the worst worst
[3:29:01] Lugges48: disc compleatly useless tier
[3:29:02] gregl__: yeah I know
[3:29:03] gregl__: yea
[3:29:11] obviouslytai: its the best by far lmao
[3:29:17] jporter_: wish they just let people in game decide between the three
[3:29:20] meincke_: are setups dead? i feel like they nerfed cc and then buffed HP to the point where nothing matters that much
[3:29:20] MaximumnNeo: Disc definitely has award for most useless pvp tier
[3:29:22] Fragssgaming: we expecting to see some notes today boys?
[3:29:24] FateIRL: some specs got lucky like ele current tier is best for pvp/pve and got voted for s4
[3:29:25] skez_live: it doesnt make sense to me that you cant use any of the sets from the expansion, they should just allow you to upgrade them to current season ilevel
[3:29:26] ALLtheEXP: They just need to have a pvp team that creates pvp-specific tier sets alongside the pve tier sets
[3:29:29] ALLtheEXP: so they can balance them differently
[3:29:52] gaulois62: @venruki what are the chance we get a  patch balance this week
[3:29:59] obviouslytai: it is very straight forward
[3:30:01] hoaylander: pvp sets would be fantastic so we could have stuff that wasn't just "more damage"
[3:30:11] obviouslytai: i just think it needs to be less rng
[3:30:14] SteLawBro: @skez_live Right? Considering the whole damn expansion is based around upgrading gear and crafting 😂 Its set up too perfect.
[3:30:15] martyw0w12: When is the next AWC?
[3:30:16] hoaylander: having legendaries like craven stratagem or natural order's will was brilliant for pvp
[3:30:24] hoaylander: craven was op as hell though no doubt
[3:30:27] skez_live: @SteLawBro exactly...
[3:30:29] jporter_: what are the chances we get another one this season?
[3:30:38] AngryMatt: balance is doubtful for the rest of the season
[3:30:46] skez_live: like let us pick which set bonus we want, why n ot

[3:44:21] csf109: what is the addon that shows what is going on in text? middle left side of screen

[3:55:26] Badasti: @Roxxybolts least seductive name ever
[3:55:29] R1_Prototype: I’m leveling an alt. I ask people to defend org so I don’t get spawn killed. they tell me I should do it at lvl 63. rofl. they should just say they’re scared if they’re scared. XD
[3:55:35] odikwow: you using dark pact perfectly has legit inspired me today @venruki
[3:55:47] Roxxybolts: LUL
[3:55:54] heymomimonttv: @Badasti i think that makes it funnier and my uncle darrell would show u a thing or two

[3:56:26] Roxxybolts: link it
[3:56:29] macdeezyx: that video is so cringe
[3:56:32] wreklol: im so glad to hear that tuning is coming. it's about time blizzard gets off it's butt and buffs DH. for instance i played rsham last night and a DH only got me to 3% while i had wall/BM, earthen, tide and 2 healing streams down. the fact that i survived that shows how under tuned this incredibly sophisticated class really is, and the true gentlemen than plays this spec should be outraged
[3:56:45] odikwow: @wreklol LOL
[3:56:45] driftwood_tc: Everyone knows all twitch chat is 3k+ rated on all classes

[3:57:33] Endoraesh: that man is tiger woods
[3:57:35] storm_chaser_ron: @cadillacseville sure but that doesnt mean everyone is the right person to give it lol
[3:57:38] xSoulstacex: oh haha 3 minute ad ig I dont get to watch this bit w chat thx twitch

[3:58:05] hogx: hard to know their relative skill levels
[3:58:12] cadillacseville: his advice worked smh
[3:58:13] Staygoldenx: hard watch hahah
[3:58:31] StromicusRex: he really thinks he helped her swing likethat
[3:58:31] absterge: did you ever show Nike’s tik tom
[3:58:34] Maxdeath1: I would have totally dunked on him
[3:58:35] storm_chaser_ron: his advice was nonsense lol
[3:58:41] storm_chaser_ron: quit trolling cadillac
[3:58:44] CKBandit: im so jaded that I think every video like this is scripted
[3:58:58] StromicusRex: he did, but since you don't give a fuck, you missed it @absterge
[3:59:02] storm_chaser_ron: @absterge did you finish avatar
[3:59:02] Cocoapuffs1: @absterge i think he did a few weeks ago
[3:59:07] absterge: 95% of them are @ckbandit 😂😂😂
[3:59:35] absterge: gg
[3:59:38] malvarcla: smoke.god.
[3:59:45] absterge: @storm_chaser_ron nah 2 episodes down gonna watch more tonight
[4:00:11] StromicusRex: wait are you watching the last airbender?
[4:00:21] absterge: hey guys if we get 1 more sub on the day we will be at 15. that’s halfway to 30 and 15% of 100
[4:00:25] absterge: rukiCoolrukiCool￼￼ rukiCool
[4:00:26] storm_chaser_ron: the netflix show just came out strom
[4:00:33] StromicusRex: oh the live action?
[4:00:36] storm_chaser_ron: yeah
[4:00:38] StromicusRex: any good?
[4:00:40] storm_chaser_ron: the reviews are... not great
[4:00:43] StromicusRex: oof
[4:00:47] StromicusRex: expected, but oof
[4:00:48] absterge: it’s great so far don’t listen to The haters
[4:01:01] storm_chaser_ron: i think it basically boils down to how accurate you want it to be to OG ATLA/korra
[4:01:08] StromicusRex: oh
[4:01:17] StromicusRex: anyone expecting a perfect adaptation needs to chill
[4:01:30] StromicusRex: comparison is the thief of joy and all that
[4:01:56] absterge: yeah pmuch @storm_chaser_ron so far it’s pretty similar to the regular story. and the characters are wayyyy more similar to those from the cartoon. unlike the movie where the characters weren’t accurate at all
[4:02:16] R1_Prototype: comic nerds need to chill in general. they are always QQ about some under-the-hood Bs. Can we just be fans?
[4:02:24] malvarcla: I like the blue people in avatar
[4:02:27] storm_chaser_ron: personally im not that keen on live action period and i prefer it to be more continuous but im not gonna tell anyone else they have to hate it either
[4:02:33] absterge: like sokka in the live action is similar to sokka in the cartoon, rather than the douchey clueless idiot in the movie
[4:02:36] storm_chaser_ron: im really excited for the 2025 stuff
[4:03:03] StromicusRex: i might check it out, i love ATLA and i haven't seen it in long enough that i can't compare it to the animation
[4:03:08] kingcamps_alot: be cool to see original stuff instead of remakes and adaptation
[4:03:22] StromicusRex: i mean there's tons of original stuff coming out as well
[4:03:28] storm_chaser_ron: I want more red lotus stuff, i hope they're in the 2025 content
[4:03:46] absterge: when you realize that unless ur like 60 years old… everything…. is a remake, all music is derived from samples LOL
[4:03:52] absterge: help us!!!
[4:04:07] storm_chaser_ron: #deep
[4:04:13] R1_Prototype: must be some sort of streamer smoke session. Ven and Supa are afk
[4:04:28] storm_chaser_ron: ven just wanted to let absterge and i have the floor to talk avatar
[4:04:31] absterge: is that when you know you’re becoming older? when popular songs of my childhood are now being sampled to become popular songs for the zoomers
[4:04:36] R1_Prototype: at the same time? yeah right? I see through your guys
[4:04:54] storm_chaser_ron: does anyone else feel like the korra seasons were out of order
[4:05:04] heymomimonttv: @absterge yea man you're old now. watch zoolander and relax :)
[4:05:04] Moobot: Latest video "Is Retail World of Warcraft Too Complicated?" view it here: youtu.be/4f4zY2X_pJE
[4:05:17] absterge: never finished korra so not sure @storm_chaser_ron I only watched the first 2
[4:05:19] StromicusRex: you know you're old when you watch the OG mean girls, then watch the 2024 version and understand references in both of them Sadge
[4:05:32] absterge: there’s a new mean girls???
[4:05:39] storm_chaser_ron: @absterge s3 and s1 are the best ones imo you gotta watch
[4:05:41] absterge: dafooq
[4:05:41] heymomimonttv: new mean girls was actually really good
[4:05:44] storm_chaser_ron: s2/s4 are meh

[4:05:48] storm_chaser_ron: s3 is a banger
[4:06:12] StromicusRex: @heymomimonttv yeah, i wasn't expecting it to be a musical, but it was actually very enjoyable
[4:06:23] absterge: oh shit Tim meadows is in the new one too
[4:06:25] absterge: cool
[4:06:40] StromicusRex: they brought back a few people from the old cast
[4:06:42] heymomimonttv: @StromicusRex my gf is huge on musicals, i dont really care for them, but i did enjoy new mean girls for sure. it was fun, had all the right callbacks, etc
[4:07:04] StromicusRex: tim meadows, tina fey, lindsey lohan are all in it
[4:07:49] hcrzealot: @venruki What are we eating today?
[4:07:58] FateIRL: supa got his destro really high lol, its insane
[4:08:16] hcrzealot: 💪🏾
[4:08:28] hcrzealot: I love oatmeal
[4:10:19] JakloomGaming770: there is just so much crap on the screen in retail lol. good lord.
[4:10:21] highmoon7: Have you looked at Last Epoch? It's been super fun.
[4:10:53] kingcamps_alot: ever listen to metal band kittie?
[4:11:07] FateIRL: bajheeras playing it
[4:11:09] FateIRL: looks fun
[4:11:27] highmoon7: It's more depth than D4, but you don't need a PHD like POE
[4:11:29] heymomimonttv: looks like just another PoE / diablo. i'm pretty burnt out on that type of game
[4:11:59] highmoon7: It's better than D4
[4:11:59] driftwood_tc: Its Diablo but fun, and not as sweaty and autistic as PoE
[4:12:09] lerler: its literally copy paste diablo, but more fun
[4:12:10] kingcamps_alot: its easier than poe and better than d4
[4:12:14] storm_chaser_ron: yeah this looks like an omega ripoff
[4:12:18] Loggylicious: just another lost ark xD
[4:12:34] GetSmelly14: itemization
[4:12:35] driftwood_tc: more endgame and better char customization
[4:12:35] FateIRL: more classes
[4:12:35] Applezbtw: its "NEW" LUL
[4:12:35] highmoon7: every skill has an enitre skill tree
[4:12:36] lerler: You feel the power as you level up, in diablo you scale with the content
[4:12:38] zer0f0x: ask Quin
[4:12:41] SteLawBro: Its more fun because we hatte diablo.
[4:12:44] StromicusRex: tf is this
[4:12:47] heymomimonttv: i might be in the minority but i think d4 is actually the worst of the series
[4:12:50] storm_chaser_ron: last epoch @StromicusRex
[4:12:52] hobk1204: D4 is all around bad, bad spells, bad leveling, bad loot systems
[4:12:56] highmoon7: you have class passives, spec passives, and hybrid building
[4:13:08] storm_chaser_ron: if I was a diablo dev i'd be tilted man
[4:13:11] storm_chaser_ron: this is such a ripoff
[4:13:13] highmoon7: look at the skill tress for abilities
[4:13:13] StromicusRex: its the same font and everything
[4:13:15] lerler: Its mostly that you level up, and get items and you FEEEL the power
[4:13:26] lerler: in diablo you get an item and u get nuked 5 levels later
[4:13:27] driftwood_tc: Its nothing like diablo, last epoch has an endgame and meaningful character choices LUL
[4:13:29] Jamzy: better skill/passive customisation - more intersting crafting basically any ARPG mechanic is better than d4
[4:13:38] lordwizardmonk: what a ripoff those mofos
[4:13:58] ramenxo: blizzard has such a negative stigma in 2024 if blizzard was releasing a new game i think most ppl wouldnt be excited
[4:14:02] lordwizardmonk: yeah
[4:14:07] highmoon7: the graphics look the same, but the game play feels very differnt
[4:14:08] ramenxo: overwatch, d4 and wow are all very poor reputation atm
[4:14:10] mrmsix6: its looks and plays exactly like every other arpg, "but the systems!"
[4:14:19] storm_chaser_ron: people were excited for "untitled survival game" despite knowing nothing about it
[4:14:27] Badasti: might have been, blizzard initially set out to make crpg's and mmo's more approachable and accessible to everyone
[4:14:30] GetSmelly14: d4 is objectively worse
[4:14:37] Vigi9413: that’s false actually blizzard releases pretty good games
[4:14:39] lerler: overwatch is kinda coming back, slowly tho
[4:14:44] ramenxo: i like all their games, i hate the dev team and slow response to player feedback. all their games are amazing
[4:14:50] Vigi9413: it’s become cool to hate on blizzard
[4:14:51] lerler: they made a huge change like a week ago
[4:14:54] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: eaverything different than wo is just so bad
[4:14:55] Varaben: @storm_chaser_ron I mean the less you know, the more you can speculate on and get excited about.
[4:14:58] storm_chaser_ron: I'd hope last epoch is an improvement considering they didnt have to come up with their own art design etc
[4:14:58] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: wow
[4:14:59] driftwood_tc: @GetSmelly14 not a meme Diablo3 has more content and is overall a better ARPG than Diablo4..
[4:15:05] zer0f0x: Diablo 4 is made to generate money, Last Epoch is made to generate fun
[4:15:15] StromicusRex: yikes take
[4:15:17] storm_chaser_ron: @Varaben sure but if everyone was just fading blizz games generally it would've been more of a "we'll see" response than a pog new blizz game
[4:15:24] pr1smm: yea CS is the only game i can ever care about for more than a month for me
[4:15:27] mrmsix6: @zer0f0x oh so the game is free?
[4:15:27] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: from the blizz games i mean
[4:15:33] ramenxo: wow is legit just the ultimate MMO, especially pvp. ruined by literally the most cooked dev team taking 5 fiscal years to make a minor change
[4:15:40] Vigi9413: every game is meant to generate money
[4:15:43] heymomimonttv: its easy to say that about last epoch when its the first week the game came out lmao
[4:15:50] GetSmelly14: irrelevent
[4:15:52] addyz0r: I can't even got online KEKW
[4:15:54] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: same with D4
[4:15:57] zer0f0x: @mrmsix6 no, it's 35 euros with  no microtransactions. people obviously have to get paid
[4:15:58] addyz0r: get*
[4:16:08] skez_live: Last Epoch has been around for a while, just 1.0 launch as a lot of people playing
[4:16:09] storm_chaser_ron: viewership isnt even close to D4 was
[4:16:11] ramenxo: i had no fun in diablo shit was insanely boring but i think i was the minority. i didnt even make it to max level
[4:16:11] skez_live: its a solid game
[4:16:27] soddi: blizzard has to play salaries to 12k employees somehow. AAA can't compete with indies in pricing.
[4:16:46] zer0f0x: D4 was a great game at first glance, just so many flaws. armor vs resistance lol
[4:17:15] storm_chaser_ron: 40 v 60 isnt a back breaking difference competitively either
[4:17:17] storm_chaser_ron: in terms of pricing
[4:17:23] Vigi9413: there’s a reason every “wow killer” game has failed
[4:17:25] Applezbtw: didnt some streamers spend thousands on d4 when it first game out?
[4:17:27] SteLawBro: Last epoch will be sitting next to torchlight in a month.
[4:17:28] stoutside: i dont want in something that has unpredictable management
[4:17:28] JakloomGaming770: once i beat the story i was kinda bored with the game, i gave the first season a shot but couldnt get into it
[4:17:47] foxyllama: ive only spent thousands on amouranth
[4:17:50] Badasti: i still enjoy wow but i think overall blizzard has gone downhill since 2007ish
[4:17:59] storm_chaser_ron: I feel the same is going on with Helldivers 2 as well
[4:18:15] addyz0r: PoE will stay on top im
[4:18:26] driftwood_tc: The diablo killer has already been out for many years... PoE
[4:18:31] GetSmelly14: diablo is the diablo killer
[4:18:55] SteLawBro: he started laughing cause he read it in vens voice 😂
[4:19:01] addyz0r: What a good off the cuff review
[4:19:18] zer0f0x: "tl:dr" btw Kappa
[4:19:21] soddi: #not-an-ad
[4:19:39] Frostyworgz: great time for 3 mins of ads LUL
[4:19:43] Frostyworgz: better buy turbo
[4:19:45] absterge: any type of RTS or MMO now immediately gets figured out and content creators oversaturate every platform for a week and then “the game is dead” gets latched onto it
[4:19:53] heymomimonttv: ^
[4:19:53] addyz0r: I played offline and classes does feel fun
[4:19:53] omnimicro: 1out of 5 ads lol damn twitch sucks now
[4:20:08] storm_chaser_ron: dude this could not look more like diablo if it tried
[4:20:15] wowsuomi: Wonder if Xaryu will play this
[4:20:18] WardenDOTA: the only thing that really matters for staying power is endgame, like you said d4 was good until it revealed its flaws in replayability and that took a while
[4:20:27] hunchurio: @wowsuomi said he was gonna skip it
[4:20:38] lerler: waiting for announcement

[4:27:17] WardenDOTA: love kicking the fireball that they bust on
[4:28:37] WardenDOTA: this is some highly ethical mugambala warlock play choosing not to use z axis

[4:36:27] setbackttv: plot twist supa tanked to 2400 to bully you for content
[4:38:15] WardenDOTA: going top is good but staying top is bad
[4:38:44] mynameistwavis: ur insane
[4:38:47] one_level: hey ven and chat, please help - i can't remember the name of an oldschool US warrior, he had a really deep voice...
[4:39:05] Marjanduhani: Bajheera?
[4:39:15] Marjanduhani: Swifty?
[4:39:28] one_level: nono...i think his name started with H...maybe
[4:39:37] wreklol: Harry Potter. 100%
[4:39:40] mynameistwavis: hoodrych?
[4:39:41] skylightxo: @venruki Do you think the new Blizz business model leak on WoW is legit? That charging aged 30+ players 30% more for sub, and under 30 about 30% less to make the playerbase younger, is good idea? The logic here is that those 30+ will pay no matter the price, but young ones want a cheap product. So making it cheap for young players, expensive for old would make new players come to the game
[4:39:52] crymorre: Hamburger
[4:40:05] one_level: hmm...yeah, i think hoodrych, thank you
[4:40:06] Marjanduhani: Klinda
[4:40:27] shogun2022: skylight in no world would that be true
[4:40:49] skylightxo: @shogun2022 So you think the leak isn't legit?
[4:41:05] shogun2022: nope
[4:41:13] reaperz14: No its not legit lol thats absurd dude
[4:41:54] shogun2022: I love how all the ads remind me im poor
[4:42:08] buoylouis: hi ven
[4:42:32] williwhite94: dude supa was rapping while in that SS the whole time and he was KILLING IT @venruki
[4:42:35] Tinmania: stergeFried
[4:42:38] odikwow: Just popped my trinket on my girl while she was stunned. We are expecting a girl!
[4:42:41] heymomimonttv: as crazy as microsoft/activision/blizzard is, that's entirely not a real business plan lmfao
[4:42:45] tangell0s: @skylightxo 0 chance it's legit
[4:42:51] setbackttv: i missed it did u win that round
[4:43:14] DaneDillon: If they try charging me 30% more for a sub because I am over 30, I'll make a new account with a younger birth year. lol
[4:43:21] heymomimonttv: ^
[4:43:24] wackpoetic: this stream used to be a proud supporter of the affliction dream... how far we've fallen...
[4:43:37] Xarotic: @skylightxo 0 chance
[4:43:38] wreklol: don't even think it's legal considering price disparity laws
[4:44:00] heymomimonttv: if the average wow player is around 30, they're not gonna increase prices for all current players while offering new players a lower monthly payment
[4:44:12] heymomimonttv: there's laws against ageism like that, and pricing laws as well
[4:44:27] zemm8582: destro is so much fun
[4:44:52] Ramajpt: Lets see that enhance
[4:44:55] williwhite94: RBGs ??
[4:45:10] wreklol: i dont hate the idea for the wow trial to be a full access version of the game for 30 days. then they have to purchase the game/sub
[4:45:13] WardenDOTA: i unironically think aff is better for solo shuffle
[4:45:18] shogun2022: did you see that guy bigdmg has like 20 enhances above 2600 rating lol
[4:45:22] williwhite94: maybe still destro i just feel u have to train the lock in RBGS lol
[4:45:31] WardenDOTA: im working on my destro but it feels way harder
[4:45:52] WardenDOTA: ya thats me and im nto good
[4:45:57] wackpoetic: only took him a few more games
[4:45:59] Ramajpt: Every spec rolling
[4:46:02] heymomimonttv: did you see any aff in awc? no? ok
[4:46:20] flames222: EU metas are always different lol
[4:46:28] wackpoetic: go back and look at # of games played on the aff locks compared to the destros
[4:46:39] AngryMatt: EU his always seemed more affected by fotm perception
[4:46:43] AngryMatt: has*
[4:46:57] Ramajpt: Bigdam is a bad ass... I don't know how he does it
[4:47:00] wreklol: Aff does the best in shuffle below 2k because of healers. healers that are 2k skill typically do not know how to maximize rotations/dispels to manage the consistent damage. after you get healers that know how to heal the impact of aff goes WAY down
[4:47:39] heymomimonttv: crazy thing about bigdam is that some of his chars are super high rated with very little games played
[4:47:50] WardenDOTA: @wreklol its actually the opposite, low tier healers cant keep aff alive long enough
[4:48:01] iLLwiLL_HS: i thought legend was 50 wins. its 100 fuicking A
[4:48:08] Cerbzz: @venruki Have you played any Ele this season or just Resto?
[4:48:15] bigpumperrz: @WardenDOTA agree, and not even talking about dps blinding/incapping dots off xD
[4:48:25] wreklol: @WardenDOTA i kinda disagree on every level but no big deal
[4:49:05] heymomimonttv: @Cerbzz he says ele has poor design and is a bot spec, and doesnt enjoy playing it
[4:49:58] StromicusRex: do you think ven knows he has unassigned dragonriding glyphs?
[4:50:40] littleballofhate: @venruki Many people describe you as one if the greatest healers in the entire history of WoW. In your opinion, what sort of drugs must those people be on?
[4:50:44] nikthevoker: NICE purge
[4:50:45] StromicusRex: or that he has a new herbalism spec to unlock?

[4:52:27] Ambersulfr: that makes sense because it's new
[4:52:39] StromicusRex: means ur good at healing
[4:52:40] DaneDillon: @AngryMatt I think it's 50 games won over 1800 as a healer in solo shuffle or something like that.
[4:52:48] StromicusRex: if u dont have it u suck :)
[4:52:59] Ambersulfr: well, it was bugged for 90% of the season to date
[4:53:06] AngryMatt: @DaneDillon ah sounds really important then lol
[4:53:08] Ambersulfr: so you might not have it and just haven't won 50 times since the fix
[4:53:20] StromicusRex: wasnt it bugged on some specs?
[4:53:24] Ambersulfr: everyone
[4:53:29] Ambersulfr: if you went over 1950 you didn't get credit

[5:10:34] LordRatigan: It's Kevin
[5:10:36] themanw1thaplan: it's neither probably ^^
[5:10:49] Pingabreath: hes got too many buttons m8 kek
[5:10:50] repsac1442: you played well but some tremors missed for sure
[5:10:59] IIyena: lmfao the bungie jump back
[5:11:08] JBugaboo: playing with the same person 3 rounds in a row shouldnt be allowed for morale
[5:11:19] repsac1442: lol 😂😂
[5:11:29] FreddoB: warrior isnt exactly bloated
[5:12:13] MrRaisin7: @venruki the big Procpooper!

[5:12:54] Pingabreath: sp carrying
[5:13:04] Varaben: yo yo my name is joe
[5:13:12] FateIRL: this warrior is somehow 2300
[5:13:17] jackiethereindeer: you know tbh, ive been playing wow for so long and never know what determines random ccs breaking when you have dots on you. sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesnt @venruki
[5:13:22] ivolzi: warrior is somehow gonna sneak one in on you guarenteed
[5:13:23] kusoneko: real rap god?
[5:13:23] Slayer_Eagleone: DansGame
[5:13:28] maralok31: toe?
[5:13:30] maralok31: gross
[5:13:36] Varaben: @jackiethereindeer rng, but some can take more damage than others
[5:14:03] walokki: Hi ven! i almost did 2.4k as frost mage in SS (EU) but its full shamans/dhs/hunters ..feels like i cant do anything ...
[5:14:30] jackiethereindeer: @Varaben it legit just feels like pure rng. ive played priest and have played the talent that makes the fear stronger and break less and it still pops insantly, and then cc's that are supposed to break on damage like hex stay on me the whole time while im full dotted. lol this game
[5:15:25] dakila24: @walokki it's all luck of the draw man, some lobbies are insanely difficult, others are giftwrapped as mage, so some lobbies you're just mitigating how many you lose
[5:15:51] JBugaboo: welcome to rsham
[5:15:55] Slayer_Eagleone: no peels?
[5:15:56] lordwizardmonk: well well well

[5:16:32] JBugaboo: yeah rsham strong but def trainable from melee
[5:16:43] empewress: I just dinged 70 on my Resto shammy. I'm gonna learn now
[5:16:46] Kujo_XX: I've started going straight heals on devo the whole game. Inexperienced healers just pop or their teammates let them fail.
[5:16:52] ivolzi: need to root and run more
[5:16:55] kusoneko: i love training rshams, they cant take the heat alot of the time
[5:17:27] Myth_The_Wolf: Wait a minute... This isn't Destro lock

[5:47:37] Badasti: what does essence break do, like 70% of their hp with blade dance or whatever it is?
[5:47:52] Slayer_Eagleone: LMAO
[5:48:00] Badasti: ah it procced his self heal
[5:48:02] Badasti: at 35%
[5:48:09] Hark0n: prob oneshot with ragefire KEKW
[5:48:10] LordRatigan: All skill

[5:48:26] Badasti: roll demon hunter, the game plays itself
[5:48:39] tampon88369: @gator_321 nice mate that’s what I was hoping just coming back after long break trying to pick a main
[5:48:53] Badasti: rofl
[5:49:02] Triangulum: jesus
[5:49:08] Lemurion1: it does more dmg than a full roll of dots
[5:49:10] PsyqoSupreme: can you turn on dps meter so we can see numbers?
[5:49:18] Hark0n: can maybe drop eyebeam haste midtree
[5:49:30] Sithue: You can purge with immo aura too if you pick the talent
[5:49:54] Slayer_Eagleone: DH is a hero class?
[5:49:58] Ditysalad: it's broken in pve as well
[5:50:07] Myth_The_Wolf: You see, mages are a blue class, and blue = rare
[5:50:14] Ditysalad: imagine cleaving with it
[5:50:15] Myth_The_Wolf: Demon Hunters are a purple class, and purple = epic
[5:50:18] LordRatigan: Wow but you have to stand next to the demon hunter Kappa
[5:50:19] ItsBees: Because DH dies in a stun Kappa
[5:50:24] JBugaboo: my favorite thing to watch is when dumb dh takes the cleanse talent against aff and is killing themselves
[5:50:26] cadillacseville: dev doesnt play frozen orb

[5:50:46] R1_Prototype: doesn’t imo aura also remove debuffs?
[5:50:48] heymomimonttv: @bergothx what spec and rating are you for almost 2 hour queues.....
[5:50:49] Badasti: yeah... dh meta is just boring dude, i cant stand it
[5:50:50] Sithue: @jbugaboo A classic lmao
[5:51:03] waitimdesyncd: Yeah play with debuff dispell from immo aura and youd be so toxic xD
[5:51:06] Sithue: Even better rif its with reverse magic
[5:51:18] FateIRL: cleansed by flame immo dispel
[5:51:24] waitimdesyncd: 276k
[5:51:28] heymomimonttv: @bergothx what spec?
[5:51:30] R1_Prototype: 275
[5:51:32] LordRatigan: glacial sweep
[5:51:33] ripzaddo: light weight
[5:51:43] Badasti: why was elysian decree dropped from the immolation build btw?
[5:51:48] riplockx: is dh busted?
[5:51:50] Badasti: did they nerf it or something?
[5:51:51] gdodmebxu: @Badasti dmg nerfed
[5:51:54] gdodmebxu: yeah
[5:51:54] heymomimonttv: gotcha, seems like way too long a queue but its also one of the most popular specs
[5:51:55] Badasti: ah
[5:52:12] southparkbbb: cant wait till the next round of DH tuning
[5:52:17] Badasti: i wonder if its worth playing with this build though
[5:52:34] cadillacseville: you can play any build as dh and be fine
[5:52:36] Baatencs: link build plz
[5:52:36] waitimdesyncd: @southparkbbb  SoD just had ANOTHER tuning announcement 40 min ago. Retail is silent tho
[5:52:42] Badasti: no i mean i wonder if elysian decree is worth playing - that's what used to be played ith immolation aura
[5:52:43] heymomimonttv: i will say, the only good thing classic has going for it is no DH
[5:52:51] rvdsupremas: My partner doesnt want to play 2s and 3s anymote untill dh id nerfed
[5:52:56] Baatencs: !build
[5:52:57] Nightbot: Necro Build: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUpv72j7Z4
[5:52:57] rizdane: link it plz
[5:53:05] squarepusher_: It depends on comp. Immo is much more sustained dps, but inner demon is for more burst in kill windows.
[5:53:06] Sithue: I like the beam build too , i think its more fun but clearly not aas good for shuffle
[5:53:08] rizdane: for my dh =)
[5:53:09] Hark0n: take furious gaze for ragefire trust

[5:56:01] bokioz: How is SOD having so much action I dont get it :(
[5:56:05] Myth_The_Wolf: That's because they're experimenting with the next patch
[5:56:09] numero5218: 0 retail pvp changes
[5:56:11] Myth_The_Wolf: No PTR for next patch
[5:56:18] foxyllama: im going to sod
[5:56:22] Frostyworgz: patiently waiting retail notes
[5:56:22] spellgunx: they re trolling teh community
[5:56:29] Myth_The_Wolf: We're probably going to just be given a date like "in 1 week it's dropping" and then bam new content
[5:56:37] Snoot1307: @foxyllama hi!
[5:56:41] thgcm: @venruki most fun healer and least fun?
[5:56:41] iwantproblemss: I spend more time waiting then playing in all arena’s
[5:56:47] shad3dspectr3: I sat in a 40 banger earlier, super exciting
[5:56:47] numero5218: bro I play sod it sucks everyone gets one shot and the layers are dog shit
[5:56:50] spacemanwx: what mmr is that q
[5:56:58] jfeliciano007: What were you just looking at?
[5:57:01] jfeliciano007: new patch?
[5:57:10] numero5218: hydra
[5:57:16] ItsBees: @jfeliciano007 SOD patch notes
[5:57:17] buffnac: lmao lvl 25 pvp montage
[5:57:21] Badasti: man you inspired me to play destruction, first shuffle ever on this spec 5-1 np
[5:57:22] repsac1442: should pop off soon people will be getting home soon it’s almost 5 here
[5:57:28] jfeliciano007: @ItsBees Oh ok ty
[5:57:29] PastaSeat: SoD keeps getting balance while we suffer under the DHs :(
[5:57:33] numero5218: check his shorts really
[5:57:38] JBugaboo: tf is that mog, are u a pilgrim
[5:57:56] bokioz: if SOD tuning release 15 mins ago, maybe we can get something for retail in an hour?
[5:57:57] StromicusRex: he's the das boot guy
[5:58:00] wackpoetic: If they added arenas or deleted premades for BGs on SoD I'd be so down
[5:58:00] rizdane: curious why  u took the vengeful retreat slow over say....charred healing
[5:58:00] Gnarbariann: Looks similar to my dh mog
[5:58:02] buffnac: well now you look kinda cool gotta go back to the knucks
[5:58:33] rizdane: yes
[5:58:42] ItsBees: Queue Pog
[5:58:44] rizdane: and then the one next to it it kinda whack
[5:58:55] rizdane: i took the 3% healing from fire damage
[5:59:04] williwhite94: its fun when ur the DH LOL
[5:59:06] bokioz: double DH is standard :(
[5:59:09] rizdane: if youre running imm o aura 3% adds up
[5:59:26] Badasti: thats gonna be a bursty lobby
[5:59:39] rizdane: take the fear also
[5:59:50] Skompa: Hey Venruki!  Can you link your fury warrior spec? or can I look it up somewhere? :)
[5:59:52] gator_321: those poor healers
[6:00:55] JBugaboo: why does no one heal? insert double DH's
[6:01:48] JBugaboo: 1.6mil healing
[6:01:49] Badasti: did the other dh just hunt you in the darkness LUL
[6:02:04] Skompa: Hey @Venruki!  Can you link your fury warrior spec? or can I look it up somewhere? :)
[6:02:27] JBugaboo: i've been in lobbies where there triple DH
[6:03:30] Axtin: monk deserves to be ccd on his whole serenity for playing no medallion
[6:03:45] Axtin: no medallion players sicken me
[6:03:48] JBugaboo: hes a human
[6:04:03] sotirios2000: dh are like annoying mosquitoes that never leaves you alone and dodge you
[6:04:05] swishoriginal: whens the last time DH was 'bad'? S4 SL?
[6:04:06] nikthevoker: SKILL DIF
[6:04:10] FateIRL: why the fk play a ww when you can play dh lmao
[6:04:19] Ultramagnus85: DH players are just so f'n good at the game dawg
[6:04:21] FateIRL: makes no sense
[6:04:22] Badasti: nown ow, dh isnt op, it's just that the best players play it
[6:04:23] TonyBoloneyx: they just put me in a game where the average mmr was 100 below mine.. i went 3-3 and lost rating
[6:04:23] Skompa: Hey Venruki!  Can you link your fury warrior spec? or can I look it up somewhere? :)
[6:04:26] Axtin: @jbugaboo and
[6:04:27] Slayer_Eagleone: LUL
[6:04:27] frost4mournee: I hate dh it should be nerfed
[6:04:36] FreddoB: the demonking!
[6:04:40] pharmztko: dh hate is crazy
[6:04:43] sotirios2000: ww is as op and fun as dh imo
[6:04:58] wackpoetic: I love the 'Know Your Enemy' talent for DH, I wish other classes (like WW) had talents as broken as it
[6:05:02] Badasti: @pharmztko to be fair i hated this class even when it wasnt op... its not even playing the same game as the rest of us
[6:05:05] squarepusher_: @pharmztko it's just hivemind bs. It'll die out in time.
[6:05:17] IIyena: i hate arcane demo and outlaw more

[6:07:02] rvdsupremas: My friend has a ret pala and dh. He loved ret more. But like he says. Ret is good. But dh has answer for everything and is 5x better its beyond redicilous
[6:07:21] frost4mournee: dh worthy than pals
[6:07:23] squarepusher_: @Badasti pretty much yeah
[6:07:27] Skompa: Hey @Venruki!  Can you link your fury warrior spec? or can I look it up somewhere? :)
[6:07:38] bjjamm: playing against a double dh comp has to be a new kind of horrible though :o
[6:07:49] rvdsupremas: Just do check pvp fr?
[6:08:08] Badasti: @squarepusher_ ofc it couldnt possibly be that people arrive at the same conclusion because there's anything wrong with the class, that'd be outrageous
[6:08:58] squarepusher_: @Badasti nah, it's just people regurgitating what their favorite streamer says (ie addons)

[6:09:42] Badasti: @squarepusher_ oh ok SeemsGood
[6:10:42] squarepusher_: @Badasti I'm more of the mindset of bringing other classes/specs up to whatever people think are OP; instead of being mad because of X thing, so no one should be allowed to have it. I want everyone to have cool stuff.
[6:10:53] Skompa: @axtin I’m on my phone, is that the import code?
[6:11:11] frost4mournee: why I can’t to buy a sub on your channel bro

[6:12:13] Skompa: @axtin Thank you!!🙏
[6:12:16] squarepusher_: squarepusher_ gifted a Tier 1 sub to frost4mournee! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[6:12:20] frost4mournee: yeh
[6:12:25] frost4mournee: wow
[6:12:27] squarepusher_: @frost4mournee I gotchu fam SeemsGood
[6:12:39] frost4mournee: ty much bro :3
[6:12:51] squarepusher_: <3
[6:13:00] turbolarry: @squarepusher_  legend
[6:13:02] jontepman: Executing the proper Dh rotation is a lot harder than other melees however
[6:13:06] frost4mournee: he is
[6:13:28] miserybro: why cant i buy a sub?
[6:13:40] squarepusher_: Kappa
[6:13:43] turbolarry: see not all wow community is toxic LUL
[6:13:45] frost4mournee: @miserybro nice try xD
[6:14:16] Badasti: @squarepusher_ yeah I had this exact debate yesterday. imo it doesnt make sense to buff a couple of dozen classes just to match the 3-4 OP classes. besides you'd essentially be  doing the same thing as nerfing if it no longer outshines everyone else
[6:14:23] frost4mournee: cause I’m living in Russia that’s why I guess :(
[6:14:56] heymomimonttv: omg u worked so hard to get there! such a struggle!
[6:14:57] Hobblefoot: Or down. Technically
[6:14:59] heymomimonttv: congrats!
[6:15:02] LordRatigan: This class is so ridiculous
[6:15:16] heymomimonttv: i'm just trolling ven it's all love
[6:15:21] wackpoetic: DH is fine, buff everyone else
[6:15:22] bimboou: sick mog
[6:15:25] slinger_007: its because its asimple class
[6:15:31] Hobblefoot: Share it homey
[6:15:33] Badasti: I'm a hater, my favourite streamer told me to hate DH
[6:15:34] Lemurion1: yea go figure
[6:15:41] Badasti: LUL
[6:15:49] heymomimonttv: DH is broken to play into is all. it's simple and insanely strong and tanky. DH meta isn't very fun and it feels similar to retpocalypse
[6:15:53] zachgamegodx: Tbf, with your mog choice you might be the odd one out on alot of preferences.
[6:15:57] frost4mournee: dh literally overrated
[6:16:01] heymomimonttv: i got nothin but love for you tho i'm just fuckin with ya
[6:16:09] slinger_007: it does yes
[6:16:27] wackpoetic: DH is so chill because you can treat the Talent Tree as a coloring book and still go 6-0
[6:16:37] okok28: Ven you have been Glad pretty much every season, how do you not have an abundance of cool weaps to choose from
[6:16:49] Badasti: 6% dam.... 6% of 100k dps is 6k dps
[6:16:50] squarepusher_: Momentum is counterintuitive to DH mobility.
[6:16:53] FreddoB: lumberdemon
[6:16:55] jontepman: Executing the proper Dh rotation is a lot harder than other melees however
[6:16:56] slinger_007: then you can spec more into eyebeam
[6:17:13] zachgamegodx: think it incentivizes the bounce around playstyle DH's have already
[6:17:22] zachgamegodx: fel rush thru 1 guy, felblade ot the next
[6:17:23] zachgamegodx: etc
[6:17:54] slinger_007: retreat into the huint is nice
[6:17:59] idiot_63: venruki you inspired me to finally come out of the closet to my parents
[6:18:13] Badasti: even if you play to maximise momentum uptime the class still has plenty of mobility with resets etc, its really dumb
[6:18:16] frost4mournee: ven change your outfit pls it’s looking so casual xd
[6:18:26] Hobblefoot: You inspired me to ask you AGAIN for that build. I wanna try DH
[6:18:26] wackpoetic: idiot_63 your parents will still love you, even if you are a dh rukiLove
[6:18:38] zachgamegodx: shouldnt u be slamming annihilations into essence break
[6:18:48] turbolarry: Twitch is crazy LUL
[6:18:52] idiot_63: my dads didnt want me to be straight but i just had to tell them i like boobs
[6:19:00] zachgamegodx: it increases annihilation dmg too
[6:19:03] Hobblefoot: Crap I don't even use Essence break!
[6:19:06] zachgamegodx: so its good to pres that too
[6:19:16] hogx: as a parent, gay or straight i love my kids no matter what...playing DH though...that's a choice, and a bad one
[6:19:17] Hobblefoot: @camrencyber Oh geez why didn't I think of that. LOL
[6:19:42] zachgamegodx: a big empowered annihilation + inner demon into the death sweep is the nice comb
[6:19:44] shad3dspectr3: @hogx KEKW this season will never be forgotten
[6:19:52] TrippThree: DH is the new paladin of the game....
[6:19:56] frost4mournee: linkin park in our hearts I mean
[6:20:00] TheNutcracka: i play bm since mop :(
[6:20:02] pure__goat: lol more sod changes before retail what a joke
[6:20:07] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: having kids or not is a choice too
[6:20:07] hogx: good point....i've been bm over 19 years though, good or bad
[6:20:07] TrippThree: One button class....
[6:20:10] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: just fyi
[6:20:13] pure__goat: these devs are 1000% clueless

[6:21:16] pure__goat: lkike why even have retail just can it throw it away and just have classic at this point
[6:21:32] FreddoB: i play enh, good or bad, mostly bad
[6:21:53] heymomimonttv: @pure__goat no thank you???? what kind of take is this lmfao
[6:22:07] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: Hydri is
[6:22:10] waitimdesyncd: negative
[6:22:11] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: Hydra
[6:22:16] heymomimonttv: me, i do the 6 month for the cool mounts
[6:22:21] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: i think i have it too
[6:22:22] zachgamegodx: doesnt mean im happy with teh lack of anything for retail
[6:22:23] pure__goat: whats the point of retail 0 changes SOD get weekly changes
[6:22:26] pure__goat: its just a joke
[6:22:29] frost4mournee: ven can you show a masterpiece of ur mage today
[6:22:33] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: on SoD
[6:22:43] turbolarry: Sod makes more money
[6:22:45] wackpoetic: Honestly, if SoD looked like it could be enjoyable for casual PvP then I would play it. But it doesn't
[6:22:45] turbolarry: meta gamers
[6:22:51] leeka: DH Destro, Rsham Rdruid make up for 40% of specs in 3s
[6:22:58] rvdsupremas: Why i say that? Why no changes?
[6:22:58] pure__goat: MOG is fire the ruki
[6:23:03] rvdsupremas: U*
[6:23:07] dakila24: kung fu hustle
[6:23:12] heymomimonttv: SoD makes more money??? retail has a $70 xpac every 2 years which makes way more than SoD ever does
[6:23:18] heymomimonttv: kung fu shuffle is hilarious
[6:23:25] Jmacklol: bro shaolin soccer is a household classic in my childhood. so weird hahha
[6:23:25] wackpoetic: Kung Fu Hustle? Great movie
[6:23:49] turbolarry: i still bet more people subbed to play sod than people will but new xpan
[6:23:57] turbolarry: buy*
[6:24:02] frost4mournee: SoD for olds or not i have never played this
[6:24:07] rvdsupremas: Why u say that? No changes? We can expecr some changes soon? Or not at all
[6:24:14] millennialmurphy: Kung Fu Hustle, ya is, second one coming soon
[6:24:50] turbolarry: titty blast, classic
[6:24:51] frost4mournee: Indian movie or wat
[6:25:12] TrippThree: Watchin this is better than watching you play DH....LOL
[6:25:41] heymomimonttv: @turbolarry dog the pve side of retail is bigger than all forms of classic
[6:25:59] turbolarry: wheres the data on that one
[6:26:05] b1det: this is how kids play
[6:26:08] R1_Prototype: I wish this was solo shuffle
[6:26:12] frost4mournee: is that your dh in solo shuffle only 1v5 right?
[6:26:16] hogx: I bet more people play SOD than play retail arena
[6:26:34] rvdsupremas: No class changes soon? Why that? End of season?
[6:26:46] heymomimonttv: @turbolarry there's no more world first pushes in classic. there's no m+. the top guilds are all on retail. MDI, AWC, etc
[6:26:53] foxyllama: fk beat her the fk up
[6:27:08] turbolarry: yea but meta games
[6:27:11] turbolarry: gamers
[6:27:26] rvdsupremas: Oh yeah that. Totally forgot awc
[6:27:28] leeka: theyve had 2 weeks to do changes
[6:27:38] Badasti: but they made changes just before the last one and made it worse

[6:27:43] shad3dspectr3: yea, changes before tourneys is real bad
[6:27:43] turbolarry: i dont care u can think what u want its a free country where i am at least and i think theres more people playing classic than retail
[6:27:44] heymomimonttv: classic is all meta gamers, minmaxing the same content for 20 years.
[6:27:49] turbolarry: u can disagree is chill
[6:27:49] leeka: they pushed ret rework before AWC finals, the same week

[6:28:25] heymomimonttv: when you have classic, wrath, sod, it's hard to say. classic is way too fragmented
[6:28:32] foxyllama: i think it goes pve retail > classic > retail pvp > wrath

[6:36:39] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: im rerolling to a Dh man
[6:38:18] CKBandit: How do you think they can incentivize healing? It seems like the very nature of healing, being more stressful and higher penalty for mistakes, turns people off.
[6:38:28] bunzarf: Blizz fix pls
[6:38:30] EvilRobotBen: are you ranking up all dps or just the ones you like?
[6:38:32] sotirios2000: you see you lost as double dh
[6:38:35] SteLawBro: I feel like ive let the WoW community down tbh by personally not playing DH because they would have nerfed it as soon as i geared one. Sorry guys.

[6:44:27] spacemanwx: he was alliance u are horde, i think u cant whisper him

[7:18:36] Hobblefoot: You know the problem with wanting to dip into streaming as a hobby? ....   It is Venruki.  I enjoy watching the stream and generally play while I watch. Otherwise I am doing other stuff.   Sigh. I guess it is not in the cards.
[7:18:40] Tragictomb: bbq sauce over ketchup every time
[7:18:48] RestoShaman123: Hey Venruki good evening!

[7:20:00] Hark0n: man must be topping them
[7:20:17] Badasti: he's looking at the ban message, something to do with botting his account or smth
[7:20:17] zachgamegodx: is it because he called himself the molestata

[7:24:39] Jarettol: how do you make every class you play look good...I can't even decide what to main, lol
[7:25:01] rembrandt89: he said everytime he applies for partnership he gets banned
[7:25:32] R1_Prototype: they should really fix RoP-into-pillar. the first time someone gets cheesed in awc it’s gonna be embarrassing. for blizzard
[7:25:46] Badasti: its probably because he links to his kick stream
[7:25:51] heymomimonttv: tbh botting viewers is kinda 5head play with ad revenue
[7:25:55] Dudewuut: his nightbot was going crazy LUL

[7:26:52] zenqutv: i mean he is an absolute maniac but when i look at the pool streamer girls at the same time i get a big feeling of absurdity
[7:26:55] heymomimonttv: @PhonyBolognaPony yea, 5head til you get caught haha
[7:27:45] zen_oni_shinobi: @PhonyBolognaPony actually would be racketeering.  fraud is getting paid for a service that wasn't preformed.  racketeering is overbilling for services rendered.
[7:27:46] Dudewuut: if crusader is applying to partner and they pull logs from his chat and see a majority of his chat is bot spam, they not gonna be too happy
[7:28:30] menshika: the amount of mini cc applied to u was just stupid but its even more stupid that during those your teammates can actually die
[7:28:31] saphora1234: Yo ven I think crusader just legit got banned. Stream crashed and his accounts gone
[7:28:55] saphora1234: It's over lmfao
[7:29:02] Badasti: he linked to his kick stream, i wouldnt be surprised if they banned him for that
[7:29:09] saphora1234: He gonezo
[7:30:05] pharmztko: #freecrusader
[7:30:46] PhonyBolognaPony: @zen_oni_shinobi fraud is a form of racketeering

[7:31:31] Somanie: it's even funnier bc I log into Joe's stream and he's actually so nice to his chat
[7:31:54] zen_oni_shinobi: @PhonyBolognaPony i'm 100% happy that you are informed on that.
[7:32:01] Somanie: I expected Crusader vibes (no offense to Crus) and it was just chill (until he got into a ss queue KEKW )
[7:32:13] zen_oni_shinobi: breaking benjamin going to be 45 mins away from me in april.
[7:33:40] zen_oni_shinobi: does kick have twitch equivalent to bits and sub profit shares?
