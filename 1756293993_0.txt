[1:14:07] s7wede: season 2 with 2 affixes would be pog. Tyrannical / Fort with the seasonal would be the perfect setup until they came up a new format

[1:17:11] Mrshilka: fair call NODDERS
[1:17:15] madbombz_fth: yeah i get the season one but now we kinda get the of bursting grievous healer dont really wanna do that , or we get qeacking sanguine on small corridors one and people be like dead key

[1:18:40] PvtHudson093: ypu can shroud it
[1:18:46] jamarky23: Sadly i have a feeling that D4 is gonna flop hard :(
[1:19:21] ZioMord: jamarky23 I think that if Diablo immortal had a good start, D4 can't go worse
[1:19:24] DrakeDuude: yep
[1:19:32] Incredible_Sausage: @jamarky23 it's already made a boatload of cash bruh
[1:19:43] Molvonos: @jamarky23 What a weird take
[1:19:46] DrakeDuude: ya, drops im sure
[1:19:47] RagingPunk: i just hope the systems are fun in the game
[1:19:49] Mrshilka: possible twitch drops
[1:19:53] Reckless_Monk: Some bigass streamers got sponsored streams for DF
[1:20:03] xumanas: Couldn't get into it
[1:20:27] TeejayOCE: Uncapped monkaS goodluck with that
[1:20:48] Mrshilka: wow in Eu is handled by a sep company I think
[1:21:01] Mrshilka: possibly they pushing it over blizzard NA
[1:21:05] jamarky23: @Molvonos We will see if its a weird take in a couple of months
[1:21:09] RagingPunk: what did u think of god of war?
[1:21:24] Mrshilka: oh it is
[1:21:36] cabalish: blizzard france
[1:21:50] PvtHudson093: pity they closed the EU office and moved it to Ireland
[1:21:55] jkitchin75: @jamarky23 why you say that
[1:22:13] propoopimus: tyhey know they dont have to pay you to play wow
[1:22:21] jkitchin75: @PvtHudson093 thats still in the eu
[1:22:47] Molvonos: @jamarky23 Diablo Immortal did and is doing incredibly well despite things, D4 is going the same 'path' as D3, but with vast improvements.  It's a weird take, all things considered.  It's like saying WoW's gonna flop, despite all it's issues.

[1:24:52] justawownerd: I haven’t played any of this new expansion, but isn’t this an old dungeon?
[1:24:52] RagingPunk: i think d4 looks really cool interms of the graphics and world
[1:25:04] Lumbdan: @Spintaru ya cause thats only 20 from 60 and time flys bro live it up.
[1:25:04] Reckless_Monk: SBG and COS's tuning makes those two dungeons easy
[1:25:08] jamarky23: @Molvonos Well, it might not flop in terms of sales but i think it will flop in terms of perception and reputation. I think endgame system will bore the shit out of people in the long run and blizz are trying modernize Diablo 4 way to much for its own good
[1:25:08] party_size_: Did a 20 tyrannical, and one of our DPS DC'`d right before bone maw. Fight took 5 minutes and 17 seconds. That dps was out lust.
[1:25:16] Mrshilka: hope server stay up
[1:25:25] PvtHudson093: @kitten_playss M+ s1 is a mix of new and old dungeons

[2:24:46] blade_killa: they are full of it KEKW
[2:24:50] Tonesters91: +17 Towel is the name
[2:24:59] Armdel: as long as people are quitting en mass they are happy Kappa
[2:25:05] s7wede: This is the first seasonal affix where if you do it perfectly it is basically noticeable but if you mess it up it's a wipe.
[2:25:07] Armdel: aren't*
[2:25:20] autodegenerate: Let’s make quaking and thundering hit same time this is fun
[2:25:29] ytsidilas: thundering is not that bad . having a bad group is a nightmare tho
[2:25:45] jerseyfive: thundering is great if you dont do keys over +10 Kappa
[2:25:52] ytsidilas: it is supbar to what it should have been
[2:25:59] abracka_: next seasonal affix, earthen. debuff that adds 15% damage bonus but causes a small aoe earthquake interrupting the caster when it falls off
[2:26:21] Reklawtam: rasz thundering; then it will be Fyrakk fire bomb, you have to all soak or die.
[2:26:26] PvtHudson093: dont do it
[2:26:34] Fortvila: honestly wow was never ment to have the avg player do above +15
[2:27:07] ytsidilas: I still see a lot of peeps that still do not know that the tank is always negative
[2:27:25] PvtHudson093: they really shouldnt have messed with SL M+ scaling
[2:27:29] s7wede: the worst is having an evoker try and clear with the tank using rescue and he drops you into another mecahnic where you both die

[2:27:32] azzurrin: legion mythic+ is still the best mythic+ :D
[2:27:39] Storvn: Thundering griefs. Agreed.
[2:27:41] sgtswoll: Honestly thundering could be the exact same affix but if they took out the stun and just rewarded for clearing closest to the end of the count down it would be perfect.

[2:29:05] mavericks312: idk man prideful is up there
[2:29:10] abracka_: a naked tuskaar? i thought this was a christian stream
[2:29:19] unowncreature: Their view of it going well is that people are still running during that affix.
[2:29:30] NBK_Sethus: yea prideful was obnoxious too
[2:29:45] autodegenerate: When I have good melee I can clear keys easily but bad melee bricks keys worse than anything
[2:29:45] moraispt: mythic dungeons would be way more fun without negative affixes
[2:29:52] mavericks312: id much rather thundering then prideful imo
[2:29:53] s7wede: For me the dreadlords were the best affix. You could choose when to engage most of them and they gave a tangible benefit.
[2:30:14] sgtswoll: I liked season 2 shadowlands it was simple and just didn’t really affect your gameplay negatively but still added something to the dungeons.
[2:30:36] sgtswoll: S3 shadowlands was good too. Also s3 bfa was great.
[2:30:38] unowncreature: @moraispt  Blizzard does not like us having fun though
[2:30:54] autodegenerate: This week looked scary on paper but it’s been worse on explosive weeks
[2:31:09] DrakeDuude: agreed
[2:31:26] Ispintowin: What affixes this week? And is it good to push this week?
[2:31:39] BestFraggerKick: who is exited for diablo4?
[2:31:44] D3m0nHunt3r666: the other monk
[2:31:56] autodegenerate: Bursting grievous
[2:32:03] sgtswoll: Only thing bad about S3 bfa was it changed the routine of dungeons so much that if you jumped in mid season you were super lost with the routes.
[2:32:04] PvtHudson093: S2 Anima power was ok but could have done with more powers/ S3/4 were really good affixes
[2:33:22] autodegenerate: Bursting through s week is fine until I hit 5 stacks like nokhood or ruby
[2:33:35] sgtswoll: Yeah I mean really all of SL affix’s were very good gameplay wise.
