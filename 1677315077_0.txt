[8:18:08] EvenstarTV: no other explanation to be 50K
[8:18:35] Maikikan: @EvenstarTV yeah to enter the rated solo shuffle kinda like heroic dungeon requirement swiftyUp
[8:18:38] DrRippinfarts: it says you NEED 408il atleast to queue for solo shguffle, how would they have much lower health?
[8:18:39] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: What I Need by Approaching Nirvana -> https://prtzl.io/wyHBV6N98ekOnNUV
[8:18:48] SilkeySmooth: 408 ilvl is the wpvp set
[8:19:00] EvenstarTV: But if you enter as 408 PvP gear HP is automatic higher
[8:19:07] djpwnt: anyone know how to get trophies of strife?
[8:19:16] SilkeySmooth: or the blue pbp set
[8:19:20] SilkeySmooth: pvp
[8:19:36] Maikikan: if you have either full honor or wpvp set you can queue up that's a pretty good change imo swiftyDerp
[8:19:54] akumaky: Is that your consecration healing for that much???
[8:20:11] SilkeySmooth: i think the wpvp gear has higher stam then the basic blue pvp set
[8:20:23] EvenstarTV: I guess the 408 PvP gear requirement is so that PvE geared people can't join, because that gear doesn't scale up for PvP
[8:20:58] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:21:49] DrRippinfarts: it's because the wpvp set is a higher il outside of bgs / arena

[8:22:58] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[8:23:26] SilkeySmooth: @Maikikan you only upgrade pve ilvl not pvp
