[2:06:07] DooDooMcGooo: Didn't enjoy BG3? @Towelliee
[2:06:07] TacDuc: Yeah, mostly also because Disc is way more punishing to play if you don't play perfectly, and it has a hard time healing avoidable damage, because you prepare for the damage
[2:06:51] DooDooMcGooo: I feel ya
[2:06:57] spanij: YES BORING GAME
[2:06:58] Templexx: lol thats my exact thoughts on bg3 actually
[2:07:00] DiiscoViking: @TacDuc facts disc is punishing
[2:07:02] Bacon_21: I've seen like 1 or 2 disc in my pug keys.  They a rare sight as is in keys (at least for me) KEKW
[2:07:14] Molvonos: @Towelliee 30 minutes or an hour for Blachole?

[2:07:46] Mecabeast: I know your not the biggest shooter fan but did you consider looking at remnant 2?
[2:08:01] DooDooMcGooo: I hate that feeling though, when everyone else on planet earth seems to find a game amazing and I just don't like it. Kinda sucks, FOMO I suppose lol

[3:06:29] abracka_: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWA0W0HJabg this video shows you how to get 408 quick asf. after you get 408, do LFR, then start doing +2-5 keys
[3:06:46] pickle_niik: sometimes the dungeon ques even if u run ur own key takes a long time
[3:06:49] abracka_: i can literally get 415-420 in a ~8-10 hour period
[3:06:51] sinlesssinner: nah, i am saying it ll be a bit more tedious now is all :)
[3:06:58] sinlesssinner: and much easier once the patch it out
[3:06:58] Snabido: Might as well not gear until next expansion CoolCat
[3:06:59] pickle_niik: wish every patch was like release
[3:07:03] Molvonos: How is it tedious?
[3:07:15] TheItalianStallion321: tedious?? have you NOT played the past few expansions?? LMAO

[3:07:27] greedykingx: all these great gearing places
[3:07:36] sinlesssinner: compared to 10.1.7 lol i am not saying its bad right now
[3:07:39] Psyphin: i went from 415 to 437 in 4 days, easiest expac to gear
[3:07:43] sinlesssinner: like u got me wrong :)
[3:07:44] Snabido: Does BoA gear from timeless isle count?
[3:07:55] sinlesssinner: its pretty good, just a bit better next patch

[3:10:06] veroggo99: been the best alt fun ive ever had in a long time for shure
[3:10:40] Hebi2Cold: Yeah they are working on transitioning old mounts into dragon riding mounta

[3:11:07] Scarhearth: I wish i wasnt so lazy though i wanna gear up my brewmaster but doing 40+ 16 keys hurts my soul
[3:11:08] Jarlan23: i hope not 11 11 is too much
[3:11:24] pikwi406: is it normal to have frame drops in Valdrakken? started recently and have a decently beastly PC, settings maxed out

[5:08:12] Nokterian: that makes no sense
[5:08:13] Rudric_Ice: WOD better than DF
[5:08:14] Pimento: Nah cata don't beat df
[5:08:15] Akurei87: Dragonflight for me is the best expansion since Legion
[5:08:17] dracullus: people just saw sub lost and call it failed expansion, and it was just a point in wow lifespan where there was less new players and cycle started showing
[5:08:20] skrin001: i think everything is better then dragon flight.
[5:08:32] Masqerader: I only enjoyed Cata because I played a rogue and got legendary daggers
[5:08:33] Brad_157: ^^^^
[5:08:39] honeybadger1113: ppl came back to the game for dragonflight and stayed the fuck lol
[5:08:42] Brad_157: cata sucks but better then DF imo
[5:08:43] Nokterian: Cata leveling good, end content good overall experience bad so much disconnecting from other stuff
[5:08:47] YMonsterszn: @Towelliee what you think wrath or dragon flight
[5:08:51] YMonsterszn: for me wrath
[5:08:57] LeoMako: If you don't like DF, then you just dont enjoy wow anymore it sounds like.
[5:09:00] honeybadger1113: your opinions are moronic
[5:09:04] mavericks312: @Brad_157 go play classic bro and get ready for classic cata
