[0:46:38] Carlt0n_B4nks: I see your point

[0:46:48] Carlt0n_B4nks: not baiting
[0:46:48] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: like adding scarab lord
[0:46:49] johnnyzampano: AOTC = Ass or Titties, Chat?

[0:46:57] 0hlando: they just seen a wolf mount and threw it in
[0:46:59] Jimfro: You want glad title? $25
[0:47:01] taylorsdank: @johnnyzampano bro LOL
[0:47:06] tuna_sandw1ch: AOTC= American Opporunity Tax Credit
[0:47:10] D_Tram: just recolor it
[0:47:11] TurdBurgison: bro look at the cost of it in traders tokens
[0:47:12] iamgolden3: kinda bs for the people that grinded that much for a AOTC mount and then this happen
[0:47:13] macjcool: they have been handing them out preiouvsly, this is just the first AOTC
[0:47:14] pmanfit91: What would you do if they recolored it? Good idea?
[0:47:17] sharky_exp: yeah right they will do anything for $$$ :3
[0:47:18] ironwire: they kinda kicked some people in the nuts with the TCG mounts already
[0:47:22] PMA_1: make an x video reply xar
[0:47:23] realstickybluntz: ahead of the credit'
[0:47:24] CoolTV: @johnnyzampano NODDERS

[0:47:38] pmanfit91: I respect that take.
[0:47:39] SirKalikan: Would you accept something like magetower challenge to reward previously exclusive rewards?
[0:47:40] D_Tram: nobody cares about TCG mounts or store mounts any mount you can buy with money has 0 value
[0:47:41] dika93: RETAIL WOW RresidentSleeper 🤡
[0:47:43] chroakio: AotC is - Ahead of the Curve, it is an achievement given to players who kill imperator in current content on Heroic difficulty or higher.
[0:47:46] Xclosetnerd: it’s like giving old glad mounts for pvp tokens
[0:47:47] CoolTV: gachiBASS
[0:47:48] Saturos47: The ZA bear came back with a recolor so you could tell who was the scrub :D
[0:47:49] Jimfro: What happend to the Josh Lujan youtube channel. I loved the Dailies as a way to get gamers to understand how progress works.
[0:47:49] TurdBurgison: they gonna sell an aotc mount at high ass price  so everyone buys the packs with the tokens in it to get it
[0:47:50] Skriptmonkey: Not saying it's a good move, but isn't retail basically just mount farming at this point? Could be their line of thinking.
[0:47:50] meatbe4t: it wil obv be recolored tho .. no?
[0:47:52] Alikso7: super shady business methods
[0:47:55] lannimite: I’ve seen some people say this will be added for a timewalking event or something and the traders tender note is just a placeholder
[0:47:55] brad1btw: not defending it Xar but that bottom piece that says its going to be 7899 Trader Tender is insane, that's like 5 months of hoarding points!

[0:48:04] Genghjs: Bring back the spectral tiger
[0:48:05] D_Tram: theres a few
[0:48:06] asloff: fel drake
[0:48:09] Kurbla: zevra
[0:48:09] Carlt0n_B4nks: Considering what Blizzard did to Overwatch its not surprising
[0:48:10] pmanfit91: Fel
[0:48:11] redbulladin: feldrake
[0:48:12] patites_: ~fel drake
[0:48:12] asloff: fel drake*
[0:48:12] rns_aurelius: it ruins the "i was there" factor that legacy games thrive on
[0:48:15] RiptoreCA: I don't like Transmog from a different but similar position. As the game goes on, there is no weight to any piece of gear, color, mount or anything anymore. There is no way to show your skill visually like it used to be.
[0:48:16] Riverxlol: @brad1btw those points are just datamined place holders, once they end up on the shop its usually lower
[0:48:18] taylorsdank: @PMA_1 literally doing it as we speak lmao
[0:48:27] Akompliss: It was Prime
[0:48:28] bryn_dee: People are freaking out as if it's expected to be cheap... that is a lot of TP tho
[0:48:31] brad1btw: @Riverxlol ah thanks! I was gonna say who has that many :D
[0:48:31] noukee: original armani bear is op
[0:48:32] 0hlando: cant wait to buy my spectral tiger for 8k traders tender
[0:48:40] jikorax: I don't have it
[0:48:40] leonwaltt: saturated value
[0:48:41] cabeshpash: @rns_aurelius yup this sum it up
[0:48:53] parkpizza0000: @Xaryu you never see feldrake anymore. giving away a mount effectively kills the mount
[0:48:54] Wabbajakkc: ':'(((((
[0:48:57] JROOOOOCCC: I still never got it after claiming it…
[0:49:00] asloff: i only have a few un obtainable mounts but yeah this makes me worried af
[0:49:07] Seoken1: mah pixels are devalued!
[0:49:07] CoolTV: but i mean retail has been dead for years, its just a money printing machine now and then they have politicians pretending  that the next expansion will be better
[0:49:10] m1lkman10: Im against giving away mounts that used to be prestigous like glad mounts, but the fel drake was just bought with real $ so I have no problem with giving away that.
[0:49:18] grebby71: I must be a real classic Andy because I don’t care at all about collecting mounts, mobs etc
[0:49:18] aelimas: that flame gryphon mount too or whatever its called
[0:49:19] rpl_1337: I got the blazing  hippogryph by watching this stream
[0:49:21] Carlt0n_B4nks: lets hope they dont kill spectral tiger
[0:49:22] cabeshpash: @CoolTV retail is def not dead lol, it's very popular
[0:49:25] LilTaisu: feldrake was diff tho, basically just a RMT mount
[0:49:26] kincaidc: instant gratification culture that’s just what todays time are about
[0:49:31] aquilon___: can't wait to see swift spectral tiger on there
[0:49:33] chroakio: How long until the reacts, do I have time to run to the store?
[0:49:33] aelimas: retail 100% isnt dead
[0:49:35] meatbe4t: @aelimas Ashes of Al'ar ?
[0:49:37] Reaperz_kinetic: @liltaisu not diff at all
[0:49:37] Skriptmonkey: Honestly, if I grinded away to get a one-off rare mount, and then blizz made it available for purchase later... I'd be pissed.
[0:49:41] Riverxlol: Feldrake is only different because it wasnt obtainable in game via gameplay
[0:49:41] FrugalRS: Is this like selling the timelost protodrake?
[0:49:42] Akompliss: It's just so lazy, like they could just make new mounts to give away. Why devalue stuff people worked hard for?
[0:49:42] aelimas: @aelimas no
[0:49:45] Chronollo: Damn, that highly devalues mounts in this game, which is one of the main reasons that some of ppl still play retail occasionally... now they will kill it for real lmao @Xaryu
[0:49:46] guld1337: whats next... scarab lord mount and title?
[0:49:47] d00dledan: retail isnt dead lol
[0:49:48] asloff: @meatbe4t nah "balzing hippogryph"
[0:49:48] hersheyjh: I enjoy retail. Lots of ppl play it. Classic echo chamber here
[0:49:48] dika93: How can a game be DEAD and still print MONEY KEKW 5HEAD
[0:49:49] Jensath: it's not dead lol
[0:49:51] Chasick: Retail is actually popping off right now in the pve aspect, pvp is dead.
[0:49:51] bottlekiddz: retail has more steamership than classic
[0:49:52] asloff: blazing*
[0:49:54] Andy_lol: retail is not dead by any means lol
[0:49:56] cabeshpash: retail is still the most popular mmorpg by a mile
[0:49:56] nzcorona: Noone cares
[0:49:56] realstickybluntz: retail only has WF and RP
[0:49:58] Deomas11: When I heard that spectral mount made more money than Starcraft, I knew blizz will never stop letting us get mounts for real money. It's just too good for business
[0:50:01] BawlmainCS2: xaryu im from denmark and yup thats pretty much it
[0:50:02] aelimas: @meatbe4t yeah
[0:50:07] meatbe4t: @asloff oh right sorry haha
[0:50:13] ShooTVeksdee: But they need to incentivize people to spend more in the store and tokens. Otherwise, wow should Bobby be able to afford a another yacht?
[0:50:17] Jimfro: You are going to DO YOUR DAILIES
[0:50:18] Badbotqt: people have been saying the game is dead for 15 years. wow will never die
[0:50:19] CoolTV: I feel you, but when is retail ever going to be good again with these developers, it's looking grim
[0:50:24] BawlmainCS2: being from denmark im probably the skinniest in chat
[0:50:28] kincaidc: instant gratification culture that’s just what todays time are about.
[0:50:32] booneytoonz: Watching Uberdanger today?
[0:50:41] MR_WYTE: blizzard needs to go on a diet - confirmed.
[0:50:49] lannimite: The mount is allegedly coming back as part of the Pandemonium timerunning event coming in 10.2.7, not for the trading post. We’ll see I guess
[0:50:53] meatbe4t: wow is timeless
[0:50:57] Genghjs: WoW 2 trash ill be guuuge
[0:51:01] dika93: wow will never go under 200k playerbase
[0:51:05] Seoken1: @Xaryu I think their strategy is new Warcraft will eventually overtake Retail, and Retail will become similar to HC/SoD/SoM etc going forward (10+ years rom now)...Completely new game is likely
[0:51:15] Skriptmonkey: This is why I love classic. The grind baby!
[0:51:32] astraldex: astraldex subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:51:33] Genghjs: Wow 2 will be huge*** imagine merging classic and retail playerbase in a new project
[0:51:37] Carlt0n_B4nks: wow will die when mmo dies
[0:51:41] tuna_sandw1ch: thats what they said about Behr Sterns etc in 2008
[0:51:42] NiveRamme: yoo, how is the little baby going
[0:51:45] Seoken1: Eventually retail is going to be considered similar to the current classic version of the game 10 years from now
[0:51:51] bramicmar: GM Xar, did you get rid of your old PCs yet? :)
[0:51:57] CoolTV: people who never played cataclysm will def love cata classic I think
[0:52:08] Chasick: How do you feel about things like wod challenge mode coming back in the form of the same timed content? (Like mage tower coming back)
[0:52:12] PMA_1: is 200k good?
[0:52:12] CoolTV: except dragon soul
[0:52:13] cabeshpash: a new wow would be dope but I don't think they have incentive to make something that's not compatible with current wow
[0:52:17] lolartsection: Reaching lol
[0:52:20] tuna_sandw1ch: why did you turn off tts for re-subs?
[0:52:38] asloff: alright chatty cathy, lets get into some reacts

[0:53:18] weil6: Whats the difference between a sub and a tier 1?
[0:53:21] Mmmarcoman: To make a comparison with music: Much like 80s music and its best hits are forever, seems the same goes for 2000s gaming of which WoW is one of few center pieces
[0:53:30] johnnyrocketsttv: are you going to play?

[0:53:48] 0hlando: Do you listen to Alex G
[0:53:51] Caledvwych: I feel WoW  has too many avenues which isnt a bad thing but where how do you sustain the spread of players to justify content creation for each.
[0:53:52] lolartsection: Lol
[0:53:52] RiptoreCA: Yes

[2:23:36] Mico027: nah
[2:23:37] seppal09: probs just went through the campaign at normal difficulty
[2:23:37] PMA_1: shes shouting out d4 so people will start playing it @Xaryu
[2:23:37] Ballstein167: Y
[2:23:37] MotionLayout: the fact that shes a d4 fan proves she has no idea what a good game is
[2:23:38] Mahca_: havent we been saying classic wow is about the leveling journey tho
[2:23:39] Voljere: ive heard that as well. people think they know wow, but never reached end game
[2:23:40] teh_villain: 100% agree
[2:23:40] combopoints: Definitely understandable
[2:23:42] zlovett08: nah fuck that. you better have missed meals for wow to be the one in charge of it.
[2:23:44] TrueNosus: a little bit of an asshole but youre not really wrong LMAO

[2:23:47] FrostbiteNOLA: @User3600 looool
[2:23:47] juuno106: I get it -- if she's in world tier 1 it would be kinda like... not being a huge fan
[2:23:47] adam_brisbane: No one "plays" D4 do they?
[2:23:47] Guadelupe: ceos aren’t gonna hardcore video games

[2:23:51] seven__h: She isn't going to make design decisions about the games anyway
[2:23:51] vyagruh: that's like saying you play leauge but you're iron 4

[2:23:58] Laserjuiced: she’s just another corporate shill installed by other corporate shills. No passion there
[2:23:58] Xspazz: is the one before her was playing wow?
[2:23:59] Sancta_Simplictas: its not elitist it a real question to determine her focus
[2:24:00] Auslanderrr: she pays to win
[2:24:00] SleeplezzViking: Im a big D4 fan i seen eli play the game
[2:24:01] FrostieUK: you don't need to know a game inside out to be a good leader, enable your people who know what they are doing
[2:24:03] Micklav: elitist if you're speaking to the average joe, requirement if you're talking to a gaming CEO
[2:24:03] hoboskee: Lol guy thinks hes a dev now
[2:24:05] thatdonkeyy: We don't want some casual gamer president! Say it @xaryu

[2:24:13] Pixiepantss: huh
[2:24:14] Deceasedcheeks: Unpopular opinion: Someone who doesn't play the game but listen to the community is worth more than someone who plays it but does whatever they want
[2:24:19] thequakin: shes lying
[2:24:19] sirdreadeye: Playing D4 sounds like an advertisement.
[2:24:20] dhrral: to be fair, none of the leaders of blzzard have PLAYED any games..
[2:24:21] TLBacon: they should be required to show their /played publicly. lol
[2:24:21] Voljere: end game is just different
[2:24:21] Pixiepantss: lol
[2:24:23] karrots96: "big diablo IV fan over here" is also super vague. Doesn't even mean she's ever played the game
[2:24:24] jrad7: she is a ceo not a degenerate gamer
[2:24:25] Genghjs: Role Gaming Kappa
[2:24:25] Sybot: Is sod p2 still not out? I feel I reached 25 like 2 months ago or so and then quit
[2:24:25] fetza108: the future of wow Sadge

[2:24:30] Moogrins: CEO doesn't need to live the games, they need to empower the right people to make the games the community wants, and make the company money for their shareholders
[2:24:31] Terror__D: @nishdj yeah. my gf used to play a bunch of chars and not all of them were max lvl. if she likes the game that way, she likes the game that way
[2:24:32] jeangastaldon: I got what you saying, but every person has its own perspective of what that game is to them @Xaryu
[2:24:35] Reaperz_kinetic: @dhrral thats not true at all
[2:24:35] artsakh32: why is it important for her to have played the games? shes not a dev
[2:24:35] Arandur87: I mean, if she likes D4 she clearly has no idea what good games are Kappa
[2:24:36] fuchai: Im sure he doesnt want the job but Metzen should be president end of story

[2:25:01] Reaperz_kinetic: @Terror__D thats not elitist dude LOL getting to max level is like the bare minimum
[2:25:01] darmorlol: Get real she isnt a gamer 4Head
[2:25:06] Deceasedcheeks: Do you think this could be a case of Glass Cliff?
[2:25:07] GrannysBoy: They should ask what her top 5 games are
[2:25:07] doctor_anoos: most ceos arent gamers.
[2:25:08] seppal09: Metzen modCheck
[2:25:09] adam_brisbane: when did D4 come out?
[2:25:12] Xspazz: D4 fan but the game was not that great
[2:25:14] drippyy212: She's not a real gamer man
[2:25:15] dika93: L ceo zero connection to the games
[2:25:15] Reaperz_kinetic: im for that LOL
[2:25:16] bladeezz1816: XARYU FOR BLIZZ PRES

[2:25:22] Pixiepantss: he can do that
[2:25:22] lampsterof79: Snutz is Canadian no?
[2:25:25] MajorDumpsterFire: @darkarazu But her job dooesnt entail what Metzen does. She's the President of a company, not a Game Designer
[2:25:30] iRayG2: Kai 2040
[2:25:30] lolartsection: Apply
[2:25:32] Pixiepantss: he can learn

[2:25:34] Deklatis: Larian
[2:25:36] thatdonkeyy: She can do great without any knowledge of the game. But knowledge of the game could definitely help
[2:25:36] KanarienLocke: what did i miss?
[2:25:37] zollicious14: If you can lead a raid you can lead a company.
[2:25:38] Avaerus0: Finding both in one person is probably difficult
[2:25:41] Mico027: gaming skills is irrelevent
[2:25:43] lukemeleney: what if I watch streamers play WoW all the time? would that qualify me?
[2:25:46] PMA_1: asmon turned down the president role

[2:25:57] the_staller: Or two guys to work together about it
[2:25:57] Ionfreeze: like Ion?
[2:25:57] FrostieUK: no way does she need to know games to enable the right people to deliver
[2:25:57] ninetysix: like asmon
[2:26:00] drippyy212: You could make that good gamer a part of the company
[2:26:01] Knaxxis: this chick knows NOTHING  about WoW - their flagship proiduct lol
[2:26:03] Muckbot1: @deelay0 LOL
[2:26:04] deepseasurfer: I mean, if shes president of this company I dont think she plays much games at all since she has 2 childs as well lol
[2:26:04] misslavandar: R.I.P Blizzard 2024 :(
[2:26:04] Genghjs: Duo Ceo one business and degen
[2:26:09] fuchai: 100% they approached Metzen about being president
[2:26:15] rOm1N_: The priority will NEVER be a gamer
[2:26:16] fuchai: no shot they didnt
[2:26:17] seven__h: CEO isnt going to make game design decisions
[2:26:22] comfyslayer: Silly Xar, don't you know games are made by CEO's and not gamers
[2:26:22] hoboskee: Gamers unions when?
[2:26:22] jrad7: dude the ceo hires people who knows wow
[2:26:23] SPeacemakerS: sup man hows your day
[2:26:25] Shakezulah22: why does the president of blizzard need to know anything about WoW?
[2:26:29] SillyPanda: @fuchai No... no they didn't lol
[2:26:30] jacksunson: she woulda said it if she had played
[2:26:31] Knaxxis: @jrad7  wrong
[2:26:41] SPeacemakerS: nice
[2:26:44] seppal09: if she played wow she would have 100% mentioned it
[2:26:45] comfyslayer: President of the gucci store
[2:26:48] TheMightis: "Big Diablo 4 Fan" won't translate to being good for WoW......
[2:26:49] Reaperz_kinetic: @jrad7 wrong
[2:26:49] fuchai: your nuts if you think they didnt bring it up to him
[2:26:50] hoboskee: Folks really want for others to enjoy things in the exact same way they do
[2:26:51] Knaxxis: 100% would have mentioned it
[2:26:53] cabeshpash: also president of the US
[2:26:56] dreamreamer: PUT A CHICK IN IT AND MAKE IT LAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2:26:58] Jessrabbit1: ofc she doesn't play wow
[2:26:58] triplezro: also from a president pov, how much influence do they even have for WoW decisions, theres so many leaders/teams in wow department alone prob making those high level decisions right? @Xaryu
[2:26:58] Genghjs: @shakezulah22 for decision making on the game
[2:26:59] tideboyi: they made a new female president because they have 100 of SA lawsuits
[2:27:01] fuchai: or hes already stated he wouldnt want it before coming back
[2:27:01] Jessrabbit1: she's an exec
[2:27:02] jazzyjoff: She has been 5+ years with blizzard at executive level. At that position you need to have the right people on the right place. I don't think she is a hardcore gamer, judging by her linked in
[2:27:02] thatdonkeyy: She could do great without ever playing wow if shes good at her job and doesn't micro manage parts she doesn't understand
[2:27:04] Knaxxis: mentioning d4 is crigne with all its microtrandsactions and $100 DLC
[2:27:06] MarkyOchoa: What if D4 is the first game she's played just to say she's at least 1 blizzard game fan
[2:27:08] zollicious14: zollicious14 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! If you can lead a raid, you can lead a company.
[2:27:08] Knaxxis: r u we kidding
[2:27:09] TheresNodiee: as long as she works with and empowers the right designers she's good
[2:27:12] karrots96: Generally the CEO primary job is to make sure the business stays a float and gears are running. You have other equally important roles like CTO or Lead Designers that run the direction of the product.
[2:27:18] Lishkah: maybe she thinks d4 is the future “flagship” project
[2:27:19] fuchai: if he said id take the job he would have the job
[2:27:20] drippyy212: In the end it doesn't just come down to the president.
[2:27:29] dreamreamer: MORE MICRO TRANSATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2:27:30] lolartsection: Fresh face
[2:27:31] Knaxxis: D4 DLC is $100 lol like WTF

[3:17:41] Awsmsauce: like when they made cata dungeons hard at release. So much complaining they had to nerf them
[3:17:44] parrakeets: Does most the population kill the raid on mythic?
[3:17:46] Walgui1: its like that for Mythic difficulty
[3:17:48] carrbon_2k: agreed well said

[3:17:51] cotaino79: how much is enough time?
[3:17:52] sammixi: its a content farm nowadays though and its all how little money can blizzard spend to drag out long amounts of content
[3:17:57] maplemakz: yea sounds like mythic raiding

[3:18:59] ImmaNewbie: @Xaryu can you link the video to send to my friends?
[3:18:59] gurknel: shit was so difficult because of that
[3:19:00] Frostlicious: One of the greatest times in gaming
[3:19:05] MONNlBLAST: Kungen used to be such a chad, he raid led in raid chat no voice coms
[3:19:14] nemcoy: Kungen admitted logging into Death and Taxses servers and whisper their raiders during raid pretending to be a fan to distract them during progress
[3:19:34] SergeVDog: no idea why we're watching old vids like this, it's not even that good, tought you'd alt-tab out of this and actually play something fun
[3:19:35] amp2011: so much power/meta gaming nowadays
[3:19:43] Gashunk1: Do we need more than a big square to play in after all?
[3:19:57] Calli_C: I made the suggestion in 2012 that streaming the raids would be a great way to connect with fans and increase popularity.
[3:20:02] its_Blocky: People in vanilla couldn't figure out how Patchwerk worked with Hateful Strikes
[3:20:02] fetza108: imagine ther eis no guide and you find out with the guild the strategy after so many wipes
[3:20:04] youngwallzy: if none streams it none would know right ?
[3:20:06] Frostlicious: HUHA
