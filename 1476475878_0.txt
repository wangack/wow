[1:29:10] Deadcells: POE is too complicated.
[1:29:11] raldrik: I saw the release yesterday. It has more systems and trees. I feel like the barrier to entry for new players is insane

[1:31:55] HerbieEregos: I am going to try it this season before Immortal because they are making it work well on Steam Deck with controller support
[1:32:05] 91Niki: POE2 is an aim to make it more friendly for new players for sure

[1:32:21] HerbieEregos: dude always belittles Diablo though, like always despite it being his inspiration
[1:32:25] faulen: yeah that is the misconception with builds. They don't start getting good till like mid maps. Till then, you are just playing some random gem/skills
[1:32:28] willsprocess: I don't know if it's just me but the wow music in the background sounds like it's been taken an octave down?
[1:32:30] TruePkera: Can I make 50k gold on stormreaver in 18 hours? I’m only level 52 though. 50k off from membership
[1:32:42] Rehctv: @Towelliee going to play some ally with cross faction?
[1:32:56] swordart2022: True
[1:32:56] herraticc: POE = just watch Lightee
[1:33:01] 91Niki: @HerbieEregos It's just friendly banter lol

[1:33:05] HerbieEregos: For sure, PoE has 6k concurrent its really low
[1:33:14] Domini1001: @Towelliee  The thing is that  PoE been constantly growing and getting the audineced for past decade and diablo will be played for 1 month at max and rip after
[1:33:15] Mecabeast: @towelliee did you see the doc custom character for the new WWE game?
[1:33:16] LspN: PoE is big the first 2 weeks every 3 months then its dead hehe
[1:33:32] HerbieEregos: @91niki I think the issue is its banter for him but man the community run with it in a serious way
[1:33:49] raldrik: I think you killed this last week
[1:33:57] 91Niki: @HerbieEregos Eh, I don't think so. But then again some people can't tell sarcasm lol
[1:34:18] 91Niki: A lot of people who play POE also play Diablo
[1:34:26] 91Niki: And enjoy both
[1:34:26] HerbieEregos: @domini1001 that isn't accurate at all, D3, D2R is still more popular by quite the margin to PoE
[1:34:34] HerbieEregos: D3 seasons are always the same too
[1:35:18] Domini1001: @HerbieEregos  d3 is more popular than POE ? you smokin bro
[1:35:26] HerbieEregos: @91niki I get that, I mean I have and want too more but twitter is like a concoction of serious fans xD just look at the reaction to the DI comments on there
[1:35:42] HerbieEregos: @domini1001 no, dude PoE is way smaller than you realise
[1:35:54] TallyTaco: im glad they are addressing borrowed power with alts in dragonflight.. lets just hope they carry through. Cause WoW not being alt friend for years usually is what burned me out and caused me to quit for long sprees of time
[1:36:04] 91Niki: @HerbieEregos Dude, don't base the entire fanbase off twitter comments LUL
[1:36:09] Deadcells: You ever try the Game Grim Dawn? Amazing Diablo clone
[1:36:20] HerbieEregos: @91niki true lol
[1:36:24] Gingerprimer: PPl also does not seem to undstand that Dibalo imortal will dwarf POE+other diablo games combined
[1:36:33] visaeris412: heard with the new league there are no new skills and very little balance. you gonna be trying out lost ark destroyer @Towelliee?
[1:36:44] 91Niki: If we based all fanbases off twitter comments then all communities are just angry spergs LUL
[1:36:53] swordart2022: @gingerprimer well it works on phones so
[1:37:01] HerbieEregos: They all have their corners for sure
[1:37:15] Gingerprimer: @swordart2022 true phones are OP for playerbase
[1:37:48] Gingerprimer: So nice they delayed imortal so all the mad ppl were able to get phones
[1:38:33] Gingerprimer: 4tree I think
[1:38:35] manmower: did you buff him up with an npc out in world?
[1:38:35] Scoodles91: last column
[1:38:38] wakeandbacon95: though cypher of the 1st ones systen right?
[1:38:39] Kyrioz: through the consol upgrades
[1:38:40] MarquisLek: set aggressive stance and use the ability
[1:38:43] Contendedlemon: can boost his damage up with cyphers no?
[1:38:51] 91Niki: and then all the mad people got phones, and now they are releasing it on PC and now all the mad people are mad they got phones KEKW
[1:39:03] manmower: oh that' s just blizzard balancing
[1:39:07] HerbieEregos: @domini1001 you should check steams charts with PoE btw, its not bad that its lower than the rest. Its doing amazing I bet due to Whales and is always big each season on Twitch.
[1:39:10] Clicklesly: Oh, that's the Toxicalic sphere thingy
[1:39:20] Todmeister9000: research everything and make him go attack stance and press his extra button
[1:39:35] Wcvechten: There used to be a broken enhancement console thing that did  % damage, and they removed it shortly after as it was mega broken, but anyone who put them as gems in gear, kept it

[1:39:42] Gingerprimer: @91Niki true Diablo omrtal is a cartel scam by Blizzard,apple,samsung and google
[1:39:43] wakeandbacon95: havent done it myself so not sure, i know there are upgrades in the console tree
[1:39:44] 91Niki: @HerbieEregos Keep in mind, steam charts aren't everything! POE has a standalone launcher
[1:40:05] manmower: isn't there also armor to make pocopo stronger when you wear?
[1:40:33] 91Niki: @Gingerprimer It was a scam to make people buy phones and tablets all along PepeHands
[1:40:58] swordart2022: You upgrade console and there is thing which gives different buffs
[1:41:02] wakeandbacon95: make your own group BloodTrail
[1:41:08] Gingerprimer: @91Niki Ipad pro biggest selling point can run Diablo imortal
[1:41:16] faulen: you will still be topping the meters.
[1:41:19] HerbieEregos: @91niki I mean yeah but they have said Steam is their biggest audience before. Its not a bad thing lol but like its peak is dwarfed by so many games. I don't think PoE is after big numbers or it wouldn't ignore casual fans or new ones so much.
[1:41:33] swordart2022: @manmower yes that too
[1:41:56] KralYoshii: 3k Q this morning in UNA
[1:42:03] abracka_: anything lower than a 10 always feels like such a gamble
[1:42:05] HerbieEregos: Diablo Immortal will be huge because its Diablo and the biggest mobile games in the East are rip offs of Diablo lol
[1:42:07] 91Niki: @HerbieEregos People need to remember they are actually an indie company LUL
[1:42:31] swordart2022: @91niki they are owned by tencent
[1:42:49] HerbieEregos: @91niki they never do though 😅. They are like the Warframe team to me, its part of their charm at this point.
[1:43:06] HerbieEregos: @swordart2022 really?
[1:43:15] 91Niki: @swordart2022 They are still an indie company
[1:43:25] swordart2022: @herbieeregos yep
[1:43:30] 91Niki: Tencent is one of the publishers
[1:43:39] amricatt: Run chad run!
[1:43:44] HerbieEregos: @91niki not if owned by Tencent they ain't. If they publish it sure but owned then no
[1:43:45] Scnozzberry: how do you obtain flying in zerith mortis?
[1:44:07] HerbieEregos: Tencent is bigger than Acti Blizz lol
[1:44:13] swordart2022: @scnozberry do campaign and some quests/achievements easy
[1:44:41] BaldManGraham: i've never been to that place, can you get flying there in1 day or?
[1:44:58] GrailNite: GrailNite subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[1:44:59] 91Niki: I believe Tencent only owns the game version in China
[1:44:59] Kyrioz: you never unlocked flying in this zone? on any toons?
[1:45:00] swordart2022: @baldmangraham yes if you do a lot of things
[1:45:05] countrycount: revered for unity
[1:45:05] Amarlian: Revered to buy
[1:45:05] Scnozzberry: gotcha
[1:45:08] Broomba: @towelliee -- will this be one of your toons to level up in DF?
[1:45:09] jaysteea: yep
[1:45:10] Winttyrr: which thing to make a legendary?
[1:45:13] BaldManGraham: cool thanks sword
[1:45:13] countrycount: but the belt chapter 7
[1:45:15] jaysteea: to thorghast
[1:45:16] countrycount: ahh
[1:45:20] Winttyrr: oh the satchel

[1:47:44] wildwittra: do you use the faire-xp boost ?
[1:47:52] abracka_: @4surestoner honestly might as well save the flux for leggos/tier if you need it for that. they buffed the amount of cinders/ash you get from torghast
[1:48:00] ClassicMalcontent: Not me. I just started SL to level to 60 before DF. Hehe.
[1:48:05] MrFuzzynuts420: they working hard on Wrath classic, 9.2.5 and dragonflight

[1:48:51] ChrisStoll: Is there a way to skip over all the cruff in the expansion and go straight to Zerith Mortis?
[1:48:54] swordart2022: @scnozberry don't be messy EZ
[1:48:56] doomkry: idk why they couldnt implement a ystem for flux on alts like the ones for soul ash/cinders
[1:49:07] MrGharr: whats your rep now?
[1:49:08] Murlock07: Morning!!! towHAMUP towHAMUP

[1:50:23] doomkry: @Towelliee quest line on the right flight point
[1:50:41] akia03: the 3 yellow !
[1:51:00] MrGharr: you can probably hit honored, compaign gives repu
[1:51:14] Night_Ace: you have to hit the lock next to the door
[1:51:26] 91Niki: @Towelliee https://ptr.wowhead.com/achievement=15515/path-to-enlightenment#comments:id=5315308

[1:51:34] jerseyfive: thats pocopo stuff
[1:51:36] danzi011: hit the console to the left of the door
[1:51:37] ootinee: Its more like  flux needs to be more useful then just being account bound because  the only thing the new currency is good  for is the upgraded legos, and they only made it so it doesnt feel weird  just needing more cinders and ash.
[1:51:38] mario32: have anyone ever played planet calypso you play with rela money you can make money by playing that game
[1:51:51] 91Niki: @Towelliee https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=15515/path-to-enlightenment#comments:id=5315308 this is a list of the quests

[1:53:31] 91Niki: They are fairly easy to get done
[1:53:43] 91Niki: Mean to An End is finishing the campaign
[1:53:53] Smeaghoul: Unlocking the secrets is the achievement you need, it should list everything required
[1:53:58] MrGharr: Don't forget to upgrade pocopoc before turning in the weekly quest.
[1:54:07] 91Niki: campaign of ZM

[1:57:19] Sollice: @Towelliee What weapon are you wearing? I have had the WORST luck with weapons still rocking a 226 green
[1:57:24] deathbyqtips: is the new mage tower up all the time or only during timewalking?
[1:57:36] SamAddams: everything but the one covenant conduit @towelliee
[1:57:46] 91Niki: @Sollice I think he's got a 229 green LUL
[1:58:12] MBG_95: or maybe it's you need 80 renown on that char and then all soulbinds will unlock on other covenants, can't remember
[1:58:16] 91Niki: POGGERS 3k gold
[1:58:24] myguyhood: you need the campaign for that cov done atleats once to get those soulbinds on alts, but not ALL soulbinds for every cov works until you do all 4 campaigns
[1:58:32] myguyhood: and also get 80 renown

[1:59:06] 91Niki: Yeah I don't get they didn't add a weapon for the sandworn relics vendor. Kinda silly
[1:59:07] Sollice: @91Niki He has the same one I have then probbaly from ZM. Kind of sucks almost 4 piece tier and a shit green weapon

[2:06:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: the quest where you use the energy to move between areas pissed me off so much when i did it

[2:06:31] dimofodi: They can be turned to tier yes.
[2:06:34] Kinghorn: turn em into tier
[2:06:46] Schloshed: Don't craft legendary legs, craft it in another slot
[2:06:50] Schloshed: it's hardly a difference
[2:07:06] 91Niki: Yeah I did that on my druid. I said screw the meta slot, and just use the gear that I got best of so far
[2:07:07] Schloshed: It only needs to be in legs if you're full BiS
[2:07:09] XarkoLP: Just get reverd Kappa
[2:07:13] aumixp: Does anyone know a good way of farming cosmic flux? i need to get 10k asap
[2:07:13] Sollice: @Towelliee Thats ciorrect your in the same spot as me. Which is why I said craft legs and wear belt
[2:07:30] MBG_95: Being on legs isn't a major deal, craft leggo elsewhere
[2:07:34] Sollice: Did you already craft the lego for Wildfire bombs? If so, recycle the mats
[2:07:55] 91Niki: LUL

[2:08:36] Sollice: Yep
[2:08:40] MBG_95: ohh
[2:08:40] Schloshed: Ahh, that's a dilemma then
[2:08:44] MBG_95: rip
[2:08:44] PokerFaceMoose: your logic is solid
[2:08:48] dimofodi: You could also just run 1 legendary for now.
[2:08:55] Ertra: what'd you pull outta the vault?
[2:08:57] Sollice: Survival kind of sucks that way. Lot of other classes can wear both as soon as they get it
[2:09:09] Ertra: nice!
[2:09:30] falldrgn: new shoulders goofin..
[2:09:49] dimofodi: Which is stronger 2 leggo or 4pc?
[2:09:56] MBG_95: 2set kinda sets your rotation and 4 set is just a dmg increase on SV

[2:10:14] Sollice: @dimofodi For survival it doesnt matter. You craft on legs unity the belt and go for tier
[2:10:32] Mecabeast: 9/5 doesn't want to spend their time grinding imo
[2:10:45] ContraRob: well you can play it a couple hours every day
[2:10:48] Finansdepartementet: Workin 9-5

[2:14:17] CrispyZenn: unlocking unity is account wide
[2:14:19] pavepawns: i like the new color
[2:14:30] skymercii: @Laxsis oh is it?
[2:14:38] Hawke_89: gotta sell them dragonflight boxes Kappa
[2:14:42] Wcvechten: They probably created a huge amount of variations, and only picked a few for the game
[2:14:52] Deadcells: It was bad
[2:14:55] masterlee05: its not @Laxsis you need to complete the campaign on every char to get that
[2:14:55] mavericks312: the thing i found cringe is ppl saying oh they changed the mount do to asmon alone
[2:14:56] warrenny: Valid outrage tho?
[2:14:59] Wcvechten: so incase of critique, they could swap it out
[2:15:05] Maydie6066: @Towelliee im guessing you saw the new race/class combo coming to Dragonflight?
[2:15:07] Sneakzx: Agreed
[2:15:11] mrpresbaby: CAPTAIN DRAGON HOOK MOUNT
[2:15:18] Sneakzx: straight up re color
[2:15:30] xiStayRagingx: recolors are their favorite thing
[2:15:35] robertjordan83: @Towelliee you think any significant art resources are not being spent on the xpac?
[2:15:36] pavepawns: im personally far more curious in regards to the jelly saber cat mount
[2:15:37] Wcvechten: waiting for a hotpink elemental
[2:15:38] abracka_: doubtful, only saying that because mrgm remade it in like 45 minutes
[2:15:39] xFevers: MrGm created a recolor in his stream in less than an hour
[2:15:44] mrmanno14: theyre done with SL, moving all resources to DF
[2:15:46] wildwittra: did you see the rainbow M+ mount mockup that Samadan posted on twitter ?
[2:15:47] Korupcija_: nah, seasonal mounts should never be unique every season
[2:15:55] abracka_: remade/recolored
[2:16:05] Mr_Rosh: How is WoW still enjoyable to people? From all I could tell, is just mindless button mashing and mount farming, not a fun game at all, more like a chore.
[2:16:07] Aegean: to many mounts now, so many are gonna look the same ish I guess duckDerp
[2:16:38] magemaster225: pvp'ers deal with that every expansion though

[2:17:24] faulen: running mythic plus is a chore
[2:17:25] LegoCoin: LOL everything in life is a chore LOL
[2:17:26] Bulgogiprince: It's like if you think it's a chore. Don't do it
[2:17:28] Daarksyde: he uses the word "chores" because that dude is lazy lol
[2:17:29] cahoots82: If it feels like a chore, maybe find something else that doesn't feel like a chore.
[2:17:32] wildwittra: if people find any sort of gameplay fun. let them have fun
[2:17:36] Phil87z: Podcast gaming ftw
[2:17:38] ClassicMalcontent: If the game doesnt autolevel and autofarm it's a chore. Kappa
[2:17:41] ManChamp: I guess if it's boring then it's a chore

[2:17:44] CrispyZenn: right everyone just wants shit given to them
[2:17:44] Broomba: @towelliee -- just loading up the game, and starting the game to play is a chore!
[2:17:47] Bulgogiprince: Life is a chore haha
[2:17:48] abracka_: "why can't i pay $100 to skip all of this and just sit afk in town with my transmog"
[2:17:50] Keyastaron_: you have 4 set yet @Towelliee ? or 2 set
[2:17:50] MrFuzzynuts420: i mean i get it, it's stuff nobody wants to do. people just want to do end game and only end game
[2:17:58] Daarksyde: he probably likes LoL
[2:17:58] taintalizerx: They want to just log in and get spammed with free shit lol

[2:18:04] Aegean: well, in MMOs you can do whatever you want to. dont want to do quests etc, then dont LUL up to you
[2:18:05] Hawke_89: its because its the same dailies for 2 years...after 8 months, grind became a chore

[2:18:35] Broomba: that sounds like those spamming texts
[2:18:37] skymercii: wut
[2:18:44] Digglio: Cess pool guild lolol
[2:18:51] Srdjan91: if this in wow is a chore, then ff14 story is chore too, la grind...
[2:18:51] countrycount: i mean...they literally said its a guild for 9to5ers xD
[2:18:52] Aegean: @swordart2022 haha true true
[2:18:52] Jokervenom1978: DEFINITELY sexual.
[2:18:54] Pritamin: adult loife pogg
[2:19:09] crizby_89: whats the best cov for a hunter? is it between kyrian and revendreth ones?
[2:19:13] willsprocess: What? I have to talk to people in a game... What a Chore.
[2:19:17] Ariea_Whisper: Sounded like a adult guild
[2:19:23] Broomba: @towelliee if u want or need a guild invite to lulas guild on illidan let me know
[2:19:38] jerexify: Struggle Bus baby!!!
[2:19:42] pavepawns: what i would prefer is instead of unique mounts. id rather a variety of different mounts with recolors. why not have a huge Gargoyle mount recolor for S1 and then in S2 have a Recolor of a Mawsworn Dog. so instead of a Recolor being the same style mount we instead keep it thematic to the Seasonal affix style

[2:20:06] Phil87z: I think people just don’t like mmos anymore they just aren’t ready to admit it
[2:20:10] angelwolftv: If that's the case then all games are just chores then. every game has something to farm on from the mmos to first person shotter with battle pass
[2:20:21] MBG_95: @rlmascot Kyrian is norm for Surv, NF I believe for BM / MM, but you can play any and still do well
[2:20:46] crizby_89: @MBG_95 Ahh i gotcha. Thanks for that
[2:21:08] angelwolftv: no shit lol
[2:21:12] Deadcells: It’s called playing the game and having fun! I am personally
[2:21:27] Th3IceCr3amMan: the chores to me is the dailies and weeklies. When it feels like i HAVE to log on today/this week thats what dfeels like a chore to me
[2:21:31] Ludjack: Lost ark is dead in few months
[2:21:34] xiStayRagingx: Nah the new generation wants instant gratification, Give me the gear with no work please. That's not what an mmo is
[2:21:38] captivate7: omg i know. that bothers me
[2:21:41] pavepawns: do you think we will see any secret mounts in Dragonflight?
[2:21:43] Pharaoh_326: cant
[2:21:44] Velashen: I want to play the smashy giant hammer dude in LA
[2:21:46] Kyrioz: you need to grab the flight path hehe
[2:21:51] Pharaoh_326: they made them seperate
[2:21:54] ispyyro: How many hours have you put in WoW?
[2:21:55] smolglizzy: I've used that term among others for years but usually in reference to doing the grind for the 5th time or something to that effect. That's less on the content and more on my masochism to get more characters to a point I want them. Maybe i'm wrong tho /shrug
[2:21:56] EscapePlan01: the quest is called "get flying asap " haha
[2:21:58] taintalizerx: I felt like you had to play atleast 8 hours a day of Lost Ark just to feel ahead
[2:22:05] bypized: @Towelliee Does Blizzard kill games? HOTS?
[2:22:19] BlockMastery: Hey Towellie how about they make Mythic raids completely equalized and with no consumables. That way maybe more ppl would be interested in doing it without the investing the time to prepare for it. I think blizzard should incentivise players to at least try it
[2:22:29] pavepawns: that reminds me. do you think we will see a different set bonus in 9.2.5 or same set bonus
[2:22:41] dragonslayers2021: eso and black desert online have choirs in them
[2:22:48] Taz_85: Are you enjoying survival hunter enough to think you might wanna go after some of the legion artifact appearances some day?
[2:22:48] Q_TheDreamer: It's not?! Anyone tryna play hots with me?
[2:23:00] garamis82: CCL season 4 starts tomorrow
[2:23:04] RagingPunk: towLets towGo
[2:23:05] Velashen: HOTS is in maintenance mode.
[2:23:34] morningporr1dge: that title WAYTOODANK
[2:23:42] Hippwn: what guide is he following?
[2:23:45] MBG_95: @blockmastery I don't think there is a blocker to entry for those who could do Mythic raid. if you can clear heroic then those people would already be interested in Mythic no?
[2:23:45] bypized: Blizzard doesnt release anything else for HOTS
[2:23:59] swordart2022: @blackforestwilliam what nonsense take KEKW
[2:24:01] mavericks312: @bypized that doesnt count as dead
[2:24:17] pavepawns: @Towelliee Do you think we will see a different Set bonus in 9.2.5 or just the same set bonus at higher ilvl?
[2:24:19] wildwittra: i would like blizzard to add features/updates each patch to revisit some areas/zones in current expansion instead of always moving to new location. Phased or not phased depending on story progress
[2:24:23] IianaDRK: i want to jump back in but im waiting for 9.2.5 to release
[2:24:28] Winttyrr: i jus swapped to venthyr onm my dh, man, it's so awkward learning a new play style
[2:24:31] Deadcells: Same here
[2:24:44] MrFuzzynuts420: most fun i had in WoW was the last week of shadowlands pre-patch and turning people in zombies all week LUL
[2:24:46] warrenny: 8.2 really?
[2:24:48] Deadcells: I play casters
[2:25:07] Gargantix: inside the building
[2:25:13] apecz: @towelliee it’s considered a chore because we are all 30-40 now with wives and kids and don’t have 18 hours a day to grind lol. So when you do get a bit of time you just wanna do you.
[2:25:30] TheCheeseWheel87: yeah but you should have to wait till the end of an expansion to have fun. i really hope blizzard can make 10.0 fun from the start to keep people engaged the entire expansion
[2:25:36] SaDos: she is near the water
[2:25:43] TheCheeseWheel87: shouldn't*
[2:25:50] MBG_95: @winttyrr don't press blade dance. use Brand>EB>chaos strike spam > EB and repeat
[2:26:05] Syn1189: I didnt even last till the first raid released and i was bored with shadowlands lol
[2:26:15] Gargantix: oh, guess i'm thinking of a different talk quest

[2:30:49] Velashen: GW2 is so good these days.
[2:31:15] Deadcells: Swtor is fun but the combat doesn’t feel as good as WoW.
[2:31:15] bypized: Charles Oliveira and Rose tomorrow UFC lets go
[2:31:34] bypized: Ive been playing GW2, man its so good right now. Its a shame how they messed up this launch
[2:31:41] Pharaoh_326: @Towelliee hear about the new Star Wars MMO by Zenimax?
[2:31:41] oraclespyro: @Towelliee is arclight qust based or play how we want?
[2:31:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: swtor is one of those game about once a year i get the urge to level another character
[2:32:05] warrenny: Might try it last onr i trued was fallen empire second expac
[2:32:09] Mitchendo64: I wonder if swtor is on ther verge of maintenance mode
[2:32:32] bypized: @Mitchendo64 Oh I def think so
[2:32:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: hoping this mandalorian mmo rumor is true and we hear something this summer at gamefest

[2:33:25] Morpserie: @oraclehuntar do you even know what kind of game this is wtf
[2:33:39] bypized: @Towelliee did you stream ESO?
[2:33:41] oraclespyro: arclight rumble
[2:33:50] IianaDRK: think theyre asking about how progression works in arclight
[2:34:01] IianaDRK: can u just play the game and progress or have to quest
[2:34:06] Mitchendo64: too bad we wont have arclight rumble machines in the game in taverns and stuff that we can access through wow
[2:34:16] thiccsushi: ESO has great story zones but the combat was too much for me
[2:34:25] Vigi9413: the new wow mobile game looks like i could spend hours playing it tbh
[2:34:37] Mitchendo64: No but that would be cool
[2:34:40] Bulgogiprince: I think he means that when you play the game is it Linear or Can you pick and choose where to go.

[3:06:36] Keyastaron_: send him to yr main account Kappa
[3:07:04] Jewishraver: gotta get flying first and KSM then alt lol
[3:07:04] imdeadinside91: use it next expac to make a dragonoid
[3:07:05] ahies28: its a fresh brand new account with no links to his main account
[3:07:26] Merkuriuz: 4 min
[3:07:27] jerexify: Couple of minutes, I think.
[3:07:33] ZeusDNA: Should just make this account only 9-5 characters and do some 9-5s here and there on new classes we vote for!
[3:07:37] kee100pure: 2 min, not 4
[3:07:42] Crios_CTR: 2 minutes for the first one to spawn

[3:08:54] Coriollis: they need to do something about the elite spawns like 20-30s time between the moment of spawn and become active
[3:09:13] r3dvibes: @Towelliee what do you think about lost ark

[3:15:47] Rexialiton: @bowsers1 KEKW
[3:15:48] tetrahydridodinitrogen: My guild said hell no to letting any Allies into our raid
[3:15:51] aumixp: @phatlootsbro why shouldnt they? they are now so..

[3:17:03] manmower: is there cross-faction trading coming?
[3:17:16] Deadcells: US and EU should be able to play together makes no sense
[3:17:42] Mecabeast: @givtater 10.0 you can be a factionless dragon lol
[3:18:04] Drelnar: my main is 229, havent played in like a year xD first time it's happened since I started in 2005 :(
[3:18:09] Heero_Effect: Can I flirt with cute drenai now?
[3:18:13] Kyrioz: i only like it if its between your horde and alliance toons on your account
[3:18:17] Jindo_ZG: they need to get working on the cross faction guilds
[3:18:20] swordart2022: @heero_effect yes
[3:18:48] Leeroypaxton: under you

[3:19:12] manmower: if the horde and alliance start getting all the same content, what's the point of factions later?
[3:19:37] Havenmess: Look at that water...seems like not your avg water
[3:19:44] Cafe0le: faction ResidentSleeper
[3:19:55] Koolsouthpaw: they need to make warcraft 4.
[3:20:00] IianaDRK: factions are there for narrative and player race choice. u dont NEED a fight between them for them to exist
[3:20:05] CloudPants8081: so friendy chat with horde and ally incoming?
[3:20:20] manmower: gonna be stories about splinter groups trying to rekindle the faction war
[3:20:21] Cafe0le: factions are holding back the narrative
[3:20:24] Jewishraver: horde and ally have never been at war in World of warcraft itself just in warcraft games
[3:20:29] mavericks312: the horde vs the alliance thing is dead

[3:20:40] Drelnar: play classic if you want to behead alliance scum really xD
[3:20:40] Sollice: I think the game is in a state where the most amount of players we can get together to play with eachother is healthiest
[3:20:57] Sollice: We really don't need to split the player base. All of the fantasy of the cities and races can remain the same
[3:20:57] Jindo_ZG: last nail in the coffin for alliance was when horde got zandalari/vulpera and alliance got kultiran/mechagnome
[3:21:02] Heero_Effect: Well if they made the war actually matter I’d care.
[3:21:03] Anzel_1: all of these vibes. the horde v ally thing is boring nowadays. and it's exciting to see what CAN come from the factions having to work together in a sense.
[3:21:04] AlphasaurusRexx: gawd my brother refuses to make an alliance because, fuck alliance scum. still living in the tbc era. annoying af
[3:21:23] manmower: burning of that big tree was probably the final horde v alliance action
[3:21:29] Coriollis: u make Alliance for 12 and your majority of paying playerbase is 16+ and Horde and u got this today faction "balance"
[3:21:41] rivera9: this for EU flying?
[3:21:51] rivera9: why isnt someone flying him around
[3:22:14] GamerKillance: BFA war was decent
[3:22:20] manmower: the different bosses in the Zandalar raid were cool
[3:22:22] GamerKillance: But Shadowlands story is just trash all around
[3:22:22] PToastman: Legitimately hating the other faction is cringe
[3:22:27] Anzel_1: the raid was very good but other than that it was meh.
[3:22:31] Anzel_1: BoD i mean.
[3:22:34] manmower: it's just gankmode
[3:22:37] CloudPants8081: xqcT
[3:22:53] Drelnar: even if it was relevant, it's not working anyway ... lag fest as soon as you enter 10v10 battles :(
[3:22:53] GamerKillance: The war makes no sense with the SL story
[3:22:57] Heero_Effect: Maybe like new world with capturing territory could be cool
[3:23:30] maalow: I only use war mode to be efficient with my mount farming
[3:23:39] AlphasaurusRexx: nah that shit was irrelevant in outlands. itll be irrelevant now
[3:23:49] manmower: splinter off a new faction, all the animal races join together
[3:23:55] GamerKillance: @Towelliee Wait do you not know? In 9.25 Alliance and Horde can do dungeons/raids together if invited
[3:23:55] Just_Jack13: They can still do a war but let people group. Who cares? Better player exp if you can easily play with friends
[3:23:55] CrusaderNero: naruu ResidentSleeper
[3:24:06] Coriollis: @Heero_Effect sounds cool , but u go back to garisson issue and housing so until something else not gonna happen again
[3:24:13] SpidercowSD: Imagine a New World Zone Control with WoW, Wintergrasp Style Siege battles
[3:24:21] IianaDRK: didnt blizz say in an interview earlier this year theyre going to move away from faction conflict?
[3:24:22] manmower: didn't Jailer say we're gonna be fighting for all existence soon?
[3:24:23] ItsACinche: So you said you have a paladin… how does it compare to the hunter?
[3:24:26] Clicklesly: I mean, they could've easily made DF about war by making it another land grab, but they said they intentionally avoided that ^^
[3:24:37] Rexialiton: Blizzard already knows what's gonna happen in 11.0 yeah?
[3:24:45] GamerKillance: Void lords
[3:24:46] Koolsouthpaw: im telling yall. Warcraft 4. theres the war. leave it out of wow if they want to do it right.  sort of like WCIII and Wrath. WoW is the aftermath
[3:24:48] CrusaderNero: oh yeah! he said "for what is to come" Kappa
[3:24:49] GamerKillance: Literally void lords
[3:24:51] IianaDRK: ofc, they plan like 3 expansions a head
[3:24:55] Colt_Engineer: we've been fight for existence our entire warcraft lives
[3:25:08] abracka_: i can't imagine his thousand years plan was to stop galakrond or chromatus
[3:25:09] Zerref87: Its the void lords, always the void lords
[3:25:11] ryanmoss35: ryanmoss35 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[3:25:15] magemaster225: it'll be the Devourer Lords
[3:25:15] mavericks312: the for telling of turaylons going wacko
[3:25:23] CrusaderNero: planned ahead? giving blizzard benefit of the doubt here
[3:25:28] Heero_Effect: I think he refers to the existence of WoW. Like if it will keep going another 5-10 years
[3:25:33] meroxzx: N'zoth final boss
[3:25:36] Anzel_1: Yeah that's what im thinking
[3:25:39] Deadcells: I bet the jailer and “what sword?” Correlate
[3:25:45] abracka_: i mean it has to be void lords he was referring to right?
[3:25:47] Heero_Effect: #edgelord
[3:25:57] mrfroob: what're your thoughts on the sword? LUL
[3:25:59] Anzel_1: like 11.0 shit, dragonflight didn't REALLY have anything spelling the way to it. it feels like an xpac for the fans. which im happy about tbh
[3:26:00] Drelnar: I prefer when they announce an expansion with THE bad guy. LK, Illidan, Deathwing style etc
[3:26:01] CrusaderNero: the jailer said "for what is to come" just in case Blizzard needs that route
[3:26:04] manmower: or they just threw that text in there because it's generic enough to mean anything
[3:26:07] Anzel_1: @mrfroob What sword Kappa
[3:26:24] mrfroob: what sword dude Kappa LUL
[3:26:25] abracka_: what other reason to "unmake death" other than to stop void lords/old gods from being reborn
[3:26:33] Kraaze21: @Towelliee maybe galakrond will become an interdimensional threat like infinity ultron from marvel's what if
[3:26:37] WarriorMuffins: !ALPHA
[3:26:43] manmower: because they hadn't created a motive for his actions yet
[3:26:47] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[3:26:53] CrusaderNero: thats literally the blizzard way
[3:27:00] Anzel_1: @Kraaze21 Brother dont get me excited that'd be so fun
[3:27:03] Kinghorn: staaaahp
[3:27:06] Coriollis: watch in the next episode in DragonBall Z
[3:27:08] PToastman: The scarlet prince opens the way
[3:27:14] Diamondead1: he is! look what he did with LK's helmet
[3:27:20] manmower: otherwise the story was gonna be stuck as "Jailer was bullied by the other covenants as a kid"
[3:27:24] GamerKillance: Good to see chat and towelliee agrees Shadowlands story is shit lol
[3:27:38] Deadcells: I hope there are lots of murlocs in the dragon isles
[3:27:42] ZephieGaming: i think they have just put it to bed as a bad dream type of thing
[3:27:43] Colt_Engineer: In 9.0, "You guys think this runecarver who crafted the domination helm and frostmourne might be the primus? The guy who is renown for his legendary crafting"
[3:28:03] Naterw: Its Deathwing returns
[3:28:05] abracka_: he wants that alexstraza booty
[3:28:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: unless we actually die this time and then its time for shadowlands 2 LUL
[3:28:14] Kraaze21: @imanzel he could work with murazond and the bronze d rakes ;)
[3:28:21] Wcvechten: he slipped and fell through the portal
[3:28:22] xaeblue: time is a twisted web
[3:28:25] Colt_Engineer: @abracka_ booba
[3:28:26] faulen: Insert a cereal killer into the story
[3:28:40] mrfroob: my hope is Galakrond becomes the big bad of the expansion. Slowly it's revealed that the Infinite flight's goal is to resurrect & serve Galakrond, and they succeed. The fight could be similar to the 2-part Deathwing fight. Supposedly he was the size of a continent LUL
[3:28:53] CrusaderNero: cereal? KEKW
[3:28:54] PToastman: I buy that tbh. Zovaals skeleton had domination ruins on it. He didn’t put them there himself.
[3:29:07] manmower: he's so huge that we could fight him on his back or something
[3:29:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Time is a tangled web!
[3:29:10] Gruffian: Story wise, they are leaving anything Shadowlands related FAR behind. Biggest failure of this xpac has been the story imo.
[3:29:21] IianaDRK: galakronds skeleton is still in northrend anyway, its not on the dragon isles
[3:29:22] Kinghorn: if only there was a dragonflight that dealt with timey wimey stuff
[3:29:23] Anzel_1: Chromatus could bring galakrond back
[3:29:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe he is the first new zone thats added LUL
[3:29:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: entire zone on the back of a dragon we end up fighting
[3:29:46] faulen: just put a cereal killer in the stonetallon mountains. That should be a good story
[3:30:00] Anzel_1: Wait did they sunny?
[3:30:01] xaeblue: blizzard set themselves up for this since the inception of bronze dragonflight
[3:30:03] Gruffian: Galakrond choked on a rock and died. Not that scary really. Chromatus on the other hand ...
[3:30:03] mrfroob: His bones are still in Dragonblight. And the infinite flight could subjugate the Bronze dragons & Nozdormu, use them to do it.
[3:30:08] meroxzx: what is the achievment for flying??
[3:30:11] manmower: I think Revendreth was the best part to come out of Shadowlands
[3:30:11] Zerref87: ptr
[3:30:13] Coriollis: what bones Kappa
[3:30:19] Anzel_1: LMAO
[3:30:23] Dreadscore: man im so sick of TW dungs
[3:30:23] jerexify: @meroxzx Unlocking the Secrets
[3:30:25] Nalleys: LUL
[3:30:33] Kinghorn: lmao Coriollis
[3:30:41] ItsACinche: Is there an addon that tracks progress for getting flying?
[3:30:46] fillefaren: Damn prot paladin is actually very fun this patch! :D
[3:31:00] Scnozzberry: its really easy
[3:31:04] Koolsouthpaw: it takes like an hour
[3:31:09] goboplaysgames: secret acheiveent?
[3:31:23] Rexialiton: the harest part is the rares imo
[3:31:25] IianaDRK: in the same update the bones are "gone", wyrmrest temple is also gone so its likely some flashback or something
[3:31:29] TialePetit: I've thought about re subbing, but I have no idea where I left off LOL.. been over a year.
[3:31:32] Rexialiton: hardest*
[3:31:40] mrfroob: Kill 10 rares, complete the main story & the 3 side story quests, loot 10(?) treasures bingo bongo
[3:31:59] mrfroob: I think, it's been a while since I did it
[3:32:22] devslewa: @Towelliee Where can i find that WA
[3:32:26] fillefaren: @Towelliee which slot do you craft unity and leggo on prot pala? @Towelliee
[3:32:28] mrfroob: Not when you're on foot, no, you're right
[3:32:29] Colt_Engineer: It only took me a day
[3:32:37] devslewa: Thanks!
[3:32:56] ahies28: !wa
[3:32:56] Moobot: @ahies28 we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[3:32:56] Koolsouthpaw: yeah thats what i meant i guess when i said an hour
[3:33:00] Koolsouthpaw: i had been in ZM already
[3:33:02] Anzel_1: Yeah it took me a day or so, about 6 hours or so I think on my alt when I went to get unity
[3:33:04] MisterD1rty: Have you tried venthyr sv hunter?
[3:33:07] Elseworldz: I can't get past the rares part. People just kill them too fast.
[3:33:12] meroxzx: but you can still do it in a day? tho right
[3:33:20] Anzel_1: but with flying, doing the campaign becomes quicker by a wide margin
[3:33:21] mrfroob: That's true. On alts that have flying, an hour is far more feasible.
[3:33:23] ItsACinche: I’ve been working on it for a while but I only have like 2 hours a day to play. So by the time I hit up LFR I don’t have very long…
[3:33:24] MisterD1rty: I love the play style of sv venthyr.
[3:33:29] Colt_Engineer: getting flying in Zereth Mortis compared to 2 years in BFA is a huge improvement
[3:33:44] dysar5150: not using pocopoc?
[3:33:44] Mikadul: just so i'm clear which campaign is it I have like 3 in shadowlands lol ?
[3:33:46] IianaDRK: mann i really wanna resub :(

[3:35:20] Anzel_1: @IianaDRK meh both games are good. different ways. hell games are great if you just set your expectations to the floor.
[3:35:25] Mallaes: MrDestructoid
[3:35:32] Arms_Warrior: what statue
[3:35:54] IianaDRK: thaddius was the pug destroyer
[3:35:54] PrimalRain: I stopped a little around Cata, was so mad I didn't get the statue.
[3:36:36] hekisan: monkaS
[3:36:39] fillefaren: @Towelliee which slot do you craft unity and leggo on prot pala?
[3:36:52] Colt_Engineer: you have enough shade in shade?
[3:37:00] wildwittra: i missed the statue due to taking break in pandaria. coming back pre-patch legion
[3:37:00] IianaDRK: @imanzel oh i know. i love them both in their own way. its just a joke within my friends lol
[3:37:11] Deadcells: I’m on thrall our server sucks
[3:37:22] mrfroob: what statue LUL
[3:37:24] magemaster225: heroic jailer numbers are pretty low, but I bet blizz just do another round of anduin nerfs next week
[3:37:49] mavericks312: nah just a skill issue lol
[3:37:49] GamerKillance: Raid tiers after Domination raid shows a lack of raiders. People are just fucking done with Shadowlands
[3:37:52] DramaticTv: just not much point in raiding tbh
[3:37:56] Sollice: I need 50 sandworm relics for 4 piece and I cant find any. Driving me bonkers
[3:37:59] Mecabeast: @magemaster225 because killing jailer lowers your probability of tier in your vault
[3:38:05] fillefaren: U just use amogus and then pew pew
[3:38:23] Zendero89: @Sollice too bad those things arent account bound BibleThump
[3:38:54] EscapePlan01: Bellular did a good comparison AFAIK
[3:38:56] Coriollis: u could check wowprog and sort it by tier/date
[3:38:56] manmower: those extra 3 bosses at end of the raid were overkill
[3:39:04] GamerKillance: properly more pushing arena's than raids lol
[3:39:05] LilPorkys_ttv: my guild had to merge with like 2 other guilds just to be able to raid. so many ppl quit in 9.1
[3:39:07] Sollice: @Sollice yea that would be nice
[3:39:24] Rexialiton: wowprogress says 63. but wowhead says 90 sodaHmm
[3:39:45] wildwittra: I hope blizz makes more raids but less bosses in them but keep them hard as the latest raid has been, so the last few bosses takes a while.
[3:40:05] Arms_Warrior: U should run black temple timewalking on this for 252 gear! I got madness of the betrayer with socket yesterday, good upgrade for me
[3:40:11] mrfroob: N'zoth was easier, imo
[3:40:15] Harch: wowprogress doesnt track chinese kills
[3:40:17] reggiepowa: yeah corruptions nerfed that tier a lot
[3:40:38] mrfroob: corruptions made it nutty, yeah
[3:40:41] Domini1001: @Towelliee  oh you raid on your monk?
[3:40:41] Rexialiton: @Harch gotcha

[3:42:21] Colt_Engineer: bro he fought to save you in SoD lol
[3:42:26] dad_tax: if you click the helm of domination it will lower there difficulty

[3:45:37] ScroogeMcDuck: hi
[3:45:40] Colt_Engineer: she's kind of selfish after he literally got burned by dragon fire and he took the helm so tyrion wouldn't lol
[3:45:55] tejastres: Good Morning. Have not played WoW in some time. This class looks really fun. What kind of hunter is this?
[3:46:23] StraightErro: Kinda like the job market? All about who you know
[3:46:33] GamerGoat56: @texastriggatrey  survival hunter
[3:46:40] GamerKillance: The problem is that TOO hard exist for raiding. Thats what I think is causing guilds to collapse faster than before. Kil'Jaeden in Legion shows too many mechanics can exist
[3:46:42] fillefaren: Its impossible to find a guild on alliance nowadays
[3:46:52] Jindo_ZG: raiding has become more demanding in time and effort over time, and everyone has less time to invest into WoW and more other games to play over time
[3:46:54] tejastres: @GamerGoat56 Thank you very much. Interesting change of the class.
[3:46:55] fillefaren: expecially on mythic
[3:47:02] enux337: yep finding a good tank guildless in wotlk was a blessing

[3:47:15] KodyTheTyger: As someone who accepted a friend group into a raid I was leading… never again LUL
[3:47:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the new survival hunter is a lot different than it used to be, and it really pumps
[3:47:43] Onur1783: Onur1783 subscribed with Prime.

[3:48:26] jerexify: @Towelliee Yes, Bastion.
[3:48:46] KodyTheTyger: A group of 5 who were friends, if any of them disagreed with each other the whole raid night was at risk.
[3:48:47] Odium_Infinitus: @jdo_porky well wow isnt bringing in any young people. we are all old here
[3:49:08] tejastres: Honestly may be bored enough tonight to jump back to WoW and try survival hunter haha. Looks really fun

[3:50:34] iamWaritself: It's hard for me to find a good raiding guild that needs a tank =(
[3:50:54] Just_Jack13: People are being so cringe about the mobile game lmao
[3:50:56] swordart2022: Haters gonna hate
[3:50:58] mackieftw: people just like hate trains
[3:50:58] Yarbek: mobile = bad, it's that simple to them
[3:51:03] theDirtyon3: The internet isn't the brightest place these days
[3:51:04] thevelblade: What is their monetization right now?
[3:51:05] CloudPants8081: towCringe
[3:51:07] Sylphy_TV: cohhBongos
[3:51:07] manmower: it's like that ripcord thing for some people
[3:51:08] GamerKillance: If its reddit then it makes sense. Forums and Reddit are so damn toxic
[3:51:13] mavericks312: they will only believe there cult leader
[3:51:13] breadwilton: I think its more disappointing at how simple the game looks, thought it would be a bit more epic closer to diablo immortal
[3:51:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: They think that Blizzard is being sneaky and waiting to add loot boxes.....it's crazy conspiracy junk
[3:51:18] Ginbarlo: LUL
[3:51:23] breadwilton: Like we needed another tower defense game XD
[3:51:24] Daarksyde: lol perfect Cartman impression
[3:51:30] Leeroypaxton: not that i dont believe, but how are you getting units without the loot boxes?
[3:51:34] LilPorkys_ttv: still gonna be more ppl that like it than hate it. mobile is huge
[3:51:40] manmower: Blizzard using the 'lawyer' language they think
[3:51:42] theDirtyon3: this is what happens when conspiracy theories are mainstream
[3:51:43] swordart2022: Bunch of insane morons wanting to be mad
[3:51:43] dozilla: it's a mobile game, the monetization will suck either way so who cares
[3:51:49] Archiee: here a box, there a box, everywhere a loot box!
[3:51:49] Coriollis: |I blame Google store for that
[3:51:51] thevelblade: How are they monetizing it?
[3:51:54] thevelblade: How is it making money?

[3:53:00] Coriollis: oiler mode :)
[3:53:11] dannyis1337: I think its because in the description it says (in game purchases, which includes random items) but I mean its a mobile lol

[3:54:20] dozilla: i'm here for WoW, no interest in Mobile
[3:54:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: With free to play....it's either microtransactions or ads....do people really want ads?

[3:54:29] LilPorkys_ttv: is it not gonna be free to play?
[3:54:33] GamerKillance: Overwatch wasn't free and they added to stupid amount of loot boxes
[3:54:47] mavericks312: dokkan, genshin, and pokemon go are top mobile games and make millions a year on stores. stpres arent going anywhere ppl need to get off that hill

[3:55:25] manmower: they going the FOMO route?
[3:55:34] MILESkg21: def the fomo route
[3:55:52] mavericks312: @manmower basically the same model that marvel future revolution game went
[3:56:13] dozilla: Just look at Hearthstone, it's only gotten worse as time progressed, this will be no different
[3:56:16] swordart2022: watch video

[3:56:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yay, the Maw!
[3:56:41] Krue_Sr: Portal coming
[3:56:41] GamerKillance: That is true. Hearthstone wasn't bad at the start then become VERY monetized
[3:56:45] Tripnbunz: wait
[3:56:46] mavericks312: @dozilla you can say that about any mobile game
[3:56:49] Krue_Sr: SHE ACTUALLY GIVES YOU ONE
[3:56:52] dysar5150: there is a portal
[3:56:53] Tripnbunz: portal rightt thre
[3:57:08] swordart2022: @gamerkillance it is same as at start
[3:57:08] Mojohusk: Kardashians?

[3:57:25] Tripnbunz: i did the same you are not alone
[3:57:25] dozilla: @mavericks312 exactly, so lets not pretend this will be any different from the rest of the garbage market
[3:57:25] warrenny: @gamerkillance Thats going tohappen with any card game. Rewards makes it decemt tho
[3:57:27] mavericks312: hearthstone is the same now as it was day 1
[3:57:29] GamerKillance: Lolno. Hearthstone isn't the same progression as it was at the start
[3:57:50] Qargory: thats what a tcg is lol
[3:57:54] Kinghorn: there is duplicate protection now in hearthstone
[3:58:04] manmower: digital tcg
[3:58:06] kokochris: As long as there are ways to get gold (as @Towelliee already said) ; I'm good with that.
[3:58:09] manmower: can you trade the digital cards?
[3:58:10] mavericks312: @dozilla just say you hate mobile games then, doesnt change the fact that mobile games makes up a great majority of earnings in gaming now
[3:58:13] Jindo_ZG: naxxramas hearthstone was lit
[3:58:14] swordart2022: @gamerkillance you buy cards always
[3:58:14] GamerKillance: Hey I was a Pokemon/Yugioh/Magic kid so I get it
[3:58:17] Kinghorn: you will only get dupes if you own all the commons
[3:58:19] warrenny: You don5 get dupes till you have all of that rarity
[3:58:24] raldrik: reverse of the intro and still gotta walk slow
[3:58:51] kokochris: that slow walk thing, gots to go
[3:58:53] GamerKillance: But im putting in the argument that Blizzard adds stuff overtimes and becomes monetized to the extreme
[3:59:19] Voramir: Kinda sad that the helm of domination is such a memorable piece of armor, but I don't even remember what that thing looks like
[3:59:23] mavericks312: @GamerKillance true but so does games like dokkan, and genshin as well
[3:59:31] Scnozzberry: questing in north zerith mortis makes me think im in uldum sometimes
[3:59:37] Coriollis: oh no its the the new crown
[3:59:49] kokochris: @GamerKillance since the game isn't out, you are only speculating.
[3:59:49] Kinghorn: naxx is out PogChamp Jindo_ZG
[3:59:53] toobaked1987: @Towelliee Consequences on Stormrage got Mythic Jailer last night
[4:00:04] dozilla: @mavericks312 I think mobile games are a cancer. i don't like them. Nobody is saying they aren't successful that's not the point.

[4:00:50] Nalleys: LUL
[4:00:51] Kinghorn: LMAO
[4:00:53] temp3st98: Sadge
[4:00:54] Coriollis: china pumping the alliance hall of fame numbers
[4:00:54] Ashkandc: KEKW
[4:01:04] Kinghorn: frostmourne keeping the alliance alive
[4:01:17] mavericks312: @dozilla so then your outlook on any new mobile game is gonna be sour, also alot of console/pc games are also adding stores because they see the money that rolls in
[4:01:36] TeejayOCE: Im on frostmourne :D
[4:01:42] skiidmark: stormrage>sargeras
[4:01:47] TeejayOCE: aussie aussie aussie!
[4:01:49] GamerKillance: Ya I hate single player games with stores. Ubisoft/EA are the biggest culprits

[4:02:02] kokochris: @GamerKillance thats what speculation is my man.  since its not out, you cant say what it is going to do
[4:02:07] TeejayOCE: :P
[4:02:08] skiidmark: Just xfered yesterday read alot of web statistics
[4:02:19] CGd0c: just tuned in @Towelliee , hows it going with chadbomb and what ilevel now?
[4:02:43] Bennodkk: pretty sure you auto get the quest once you are in the first dungeon
[4:03:24] GamerKillance: @kokochris You're confusing likelihood for certainty. I've said this a couple of times that it'll likely happen which means likelihood. I haven't said anything in a certain tense yet
[4:03:40] manmower: Stormrage runs all the alliance open world pvp zergs
[4:03:56] GamerKillance: And used Blizzards history as examples. That's how arguments work lol
[4:04:05] MILESkg21: Pelagos the real hero of the expansion Kappa

[4:07:53] dysar5150: ya
[4:07:55] dysar5150: 3k
[4:07:56] dozilla: @mavericks312 correct, i'm immediately skeptical. The mobile game "creep" into our traditional games is one of the main reasons i despise it.
[4:08:05] Clicklesly: @tomcruise210 Not anymore ^^
[4:08:07] j_bar111: @tomcruise210 not anymore you get like 1900 rep for skipping
[4:08:08] Crios_CTR: ah. i had the same issue with the same profile you mainly use.  had to turn off the decimals in the mod part
[4:08:21] dysar5150: need 2k more for the leggo though
[4:08:47] duman_2020: Tell me how I can make gold to keep on playing each month without having to buy token with money? I can only play like 2-3 hours a day...Any tips you can give @Towelliee ??
[4:08:54] Crios_CTR: cool thanks
[4:09:44] tomcruise210: @tomcruise210 oh shit i didnt know that thats awesome
[4:09:59] dysar5150: don't forget the treasure room in this area you can get 246 rings and 2 trinkets
[4:10:18] Yarbek: @dysar5150 and neck
[4:10:32] Alexkayzz: @duman_2020 it's probably much more worth it to work 1 hr irl for the sub cost instead of spending hours griding gold which you could use instead having fun :P
[4:10:34] dysar5150: ya forgot the neck
[4:10:35] Bartillo: @Towelliee did you down the new Ultimate? Dragonsong war
[4:11:00] Nalleys: you get a chance to go Lfr yet?
[4:11:20] duman_2020: @Alexkayzz I know, but I honestly didn't want to spend actual money. But yeah you're totally correct.

[5:27:27] manmower: achievements should be called "I survived Shadowlands and all i got was this t-shirt"
[5:28:09] PvtHudson093: yes
[5:28:13] OGXanos: As someone who skipped all raids, the idea of having all raids be relevant sounds great.
[5:28:14] tomcruise210: @Koolsouthpaw just instanced content. no random stuff but group finder/pre mades are
[5:28:17] GamerKillance: Mythic is 304 and end raid bosses are 311 @Towelliee

[5:29:03] Rottencoarse: mrgm found about that in the ptr
[5:29:05] Koolsouthpaw: @tomcruise210 thanks!
[5:29:09] GamerKillance: I can post if you give me rights to post link
[5:29:18] Beriggeek: @gregltv a little foolish to think no one will play s4
[5:29:29] Mythryx: If you had to choose, would you play a priest or a warlock?
[5:29:39] Ponzie: yeah - but I think there's a weekly cap of how many tokens you can get
[5:29:44] manmower: doing normal lets you get an item to upgrade items to heroic?
[5:29:47] PvtHudson093: isnt there a cap of 3 tokens
[5:30:01] manmower: or will all of the bosses just drop tokens?
[5:30:28] GamerKillance: Ya the new raid ilvl for highest is 304 and 311. have fun

[5:34:24] manmower: enabled the RTX lighting
[5:34:26] XshadowturkeyX: wasnt shadowlands alpha like 5 months after it got announced? i dont think they will wait that long for dragonflight alpha
[5:34:51] Merex760: High pixel density and smaller screens. Mobile always will look sharper, but PC might have higher res textures/effects and stuff
[5:35:29] Ascendor81: Higher pixel density = better gameplay? :)
[5:35:31] RagingPunk: lol
[5:35:36] RagingPunk: cant wait

[5:40:14] manmower: they're speedrunning strats
[5:40:18] feels____: determination PogChamp
[5:40:21] 91Niki: This is why I don't have the patience for LFR anymore at this point in the exp
[5:40:33] andycoin99: that mightve been the worst lfr experiance ive seen
[5:40:39] Mitune: and that is why LFR should just be removed LUL
[5:40:54] MILESkg21: LFR makes me re-think humanity
[5:41:04] CloudPants8081: towBolvar
[5:41:13] Korupcija_: when it comes to streaming raids I think it's good to stream when you're close to kill
[5:41:14] 3663Sharad: IMO LFR is a time waste
[5:41:31] Cyllah7: what nameplate add on do you use
[5:42:17] andycoin99: @Towelliee LETS KEY I shall shwo you the power of prot warrior
[5:42:21] Elseworldz: I do lfr on alts all the time. If getting into normal/heroic was easier I'd do that.
[5:42:21] theDirtyon3: wtf is this guy talking about?
[5:42:25] manmower: normal should be LFR
[5:42:37] 91Niki: It's def not a waste of time, but it's too time consuming for the amount you get out of it. Gattz and I spend a few hours last week on LFR, got 2 drops between the both of us. Just felt wasted for sure
[5:42:48] chrisburhans: 187
[5:42:50] tomcruise210: they gonna be spouting that nonsense in wrath too KEKW
[5:42:52] andycoin99: thunderclap is trash now
[5:42:55] manmower: LFR should have higher drop rate or something
[5:42:59] Kinghorn: give em the clap
[5:43:02] abracka_: i just want my clapback warrior back :(
[5:43:34] Koolsouthpaw: yeah but sometimes LFR all you get. even normals are very gate keepy if your not in a guild
[5:43:41] Mitune: There just needs to be a completely new content for teaching people raid and providing catch up gear that works way better than LFR
[5:43:46] Maydie6066: @91Niki I agree with that statement, the biggest issue I feel makes LFR bad is thats too many people are lazy, not bad. they expect that there will be 2-3 people super geared that will carry it all
[5:43:53] jumbobananasplit: PizzaTime PizzaTime PizzaTime PizzaTime
[5:43:53] bgriff87: In terms of taking or War overall?
[5:43:57] bgriff87: tanking*
[5:44:10] Naturalbeef: Prot Warrior is an iconic tank and should always be a meta
[5:44:12] manmower: LFR should highlight where people should stand and teach mechanics
[5:44:13] JansonLives: Mike Ybarra didn't give somebody a raise and now they're punishing warriors. Kappa
[5:44:41] andycoin99: @Naturalbeef finally a knoiwledgable person
[5:44:42] Clicklesly: Not as Prot though Kappa
[5:44:46] 91Niki: @Maydie6066 Yeah for sure, people are extremely lazy in there. Just not bothering to do their rotation properly, even auto attacking. Makes a run super tedious to complete. And then when you don't get any loot, it just... doesn't feel fun at all
[5:44:50] MILESkg21: def not as WAR KEKW
[5:45:03] manmower: Mike wanted to keep warriors weak for now, so they pop off as dragon warriors in DF
[5:45:12] Korupcija_: fucking mike man, what a guy
[5:45:27] andycoin99: Im cool with that
[5:45:35] manmower: dragon roar will summon dragons now
[5:45:53] andycoin99: yeah how is there a dragon healer but not a dragon tank?
[5:45:56] Mitune: make gladiator 4th spec
[5:46:12] manmower: just add talents for gladiator stance onto arms or fury
[5:46:20] Mitune: I mean give everybody a 4th
[5:46:23] bgriff87: Dragon War should summon a dragon that slam into the ground like mage's meteor towPog
[5:46:24] enux337: ^ make it a talent
[5:46:26] aleck1776: Shaman 4th spec kekw
[5:46:29] Elseworldz: And then druids would need a FIFTH spec. Which would be... what?

[5:46:38] jaysteea: or the battle mage spec
[5:46:41] Kisswani: ret paladin 4th spec is an actually good DPS Kappa
[5:46:50] manmower: Ion said it was too good because it was dps on a prot spec, just move it to using a shield on one of the dps specs
[5:46:51] XshadowturkeyX: yeah shaman 4th spec bring back vanilla tanking
[5:46:54] theDirtyon3: druid only has three specs feral doesnt count Kappa

[5:53:01] Ganohh: YA HARR
[5:53:05] Mitune: I dont think they care about SL balance anymore which is fair
[5:53:08] magemaster225: people dont want underperformers to tightly tune themselves, they want underperformers to get cranked to 11
