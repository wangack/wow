[1:54:33] Crowzcut: its legos in diablo 3 towel
[1:54:35] zoovthepally: I agree with placeholders but I wouldn't be surprised if it was real
[1:54:37] Sincline387: yea placeholders while they figure out if they can charge more
[1:54:39] Rexialiton: like why is this surprising people? its a f2p game. ofc there is microtransactions
[1:54:44] Calphurnious: @Elementlolz1 keep making excuses
[1:54:48] Dred_Scythe: @Towelliee I know Echo (fellow Diablo creator / Partner here) The TL;DR is everything BUT straight Eternal Orbs and Platinum are worth buying. All the bundles minus the Normal Gem pack are worth it, some are very gracious. Eternal Orbs and Platinum are Whale Traps.
[1:54:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: its a f2p game pricing for anything shouldnt be that surprising
[1:54:49] mavericks312: raid shadow legends, dokkan, legends all have sales exactly like this
[1:54:50] gledoc: all i hear on this video is money lol
[1:54:51] Coldfire989: @hairgel_model doubt it those are standard ones for the use

[1:55:32] quinshang: he knows where the herb is thats for sure
[1:55:57] odtee: seems like the cash shops take as much due diligence than buying a stock. rather do that
[1:56:05] Crowzcut: quin will spend alot on this game
[1:56:09] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[1:56:12] quinshang: NA math

[1:56:49] magemaster225: where do I get the eevee though
[1:56:52] mavericks312: if it's like every other mobile game yes
[1:56:52] Mecabeast: what happens if I put them in a gauntlet and snap tho
[1:56:53] Aquadriel: orbs can be gotten in game
[1:56:58] szble: yeah but not as much
[1:57:10] mavericks312: they probably have them as part of a daily login bonus
[1:57:12] gledoc: free shit wont get you shit its useless junk
[1:57:12] Crowzcut: he said he will but if its good game
[1:57:13] sinlesssinner: you cant get em in the game i think, otherwise there is no point to have it on the shop..
[1:57:14] MadCowScurge: and the empty your PayPal account stone..
[1:57:25] Dred_Scythe: @Towelliee Family Reforge Stones aren't attainable via in-game currencies.
[1:57:43] mavericks312: @sinlesssinner wrong look at other games you can earn stuff in game an still buy them
[1:57:57] gledoc: i hate these games like fortnite wow/diablo its all about money league of legends
[1:57:58] lockzp: BP sodaSUFFER
[1:58:01] Crowzcut: wow should have battle pass
[1:58:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: pretty sure i've never spent money on any mobile game and I still have fun with them
[1:58:10] dokor: so yeah, it's like every mobile game ever
[1:58:13] Sollice: @wappedge Welcome to mobile games

[1:58:16] 0dellil0: battle pass nice! Cool mechanics
[1:58:17] gledoc: ye
[1:58:17] Poriand: I would atleast get the battle pass. i like more things to work towards lol
[1:58:26] Aquadriel: battle pass doesnt look bad tbh
[1:58:29] Rexialiton: not bad at all
[1:58:31] jaykyew: Still a better battle pass than Infinite
[1:58:32] Sollice: I spent like $5 on Raid Shadowlegends and havent spent anymore
[1:58:34] mavericks312: @wappedge every mobile game is like this sooo
[1:58:36] kokochris: The question is, do you "have" to do this to even play the game at a reasonable rate at end game ?
[1:58:37] odtee: just let me pay 5 bucks to play the game for a month with everything included
[1:58:38] CDubTheRIPper: GabeN
[1:58:40] gledoc: if evry item cost 5 bucks it adds up alot
[1:58:41] Dankmanarmy: This is normal phone game, pretty good
[1:58:43] zoovthepally: i wont lie ive spent some cash on hearthstone
[1:58:50] Spaede: Goodness blizz is gonna take in money from this. I’m not touching it but goddam
[1:58:53] SlackerSlack017: lets go netease
[1:59:00] kokochris: if not, then it doesnt bother me.  If you "have" to do this to even play the end game, thats a different story
[1:59:00] Gaphill: super cool dude
[1:59:05] Dred_Scythe: @Towelliee Battlepass is a 60 buck value when you itemize the paid track. It's an easy buy.
[1:59:08] szble: so gems are the gacha element?
[1:59:13] gledoc: i know that is why i dont play them @mavericks312  i play other games on switch singleplayer games you only can be good in these games when spending money on getting rare items
[1:59:13] metavahn231: gift of purchase
[1:59:15] adxx: for all those bitching, remember that most of us pay $15 a month on WoW.... and look where that game has been the last couple years lol.
[1:59:17] Aquadriel: renown ptsd WutFace
[1:59:19] xrandomdoodx: renown returns LUL

[1:59:47] MrGM: this guy is a good salesman
[1:59:48] zoovthepally: I personally think wow is really good value for $15 i mean look at this diablo game
[1:59:51] Mecabeast: is it just cosmetic battle pass or is there advantages?
[1:59:53] SlackerSlack017: sounds like supercell
[2:00:03] Korupcija_: haha
[2:00:04] Aquadriel: LUL

[2:00:55] lilwaldo: @Towelliee Do you think it would be a great idea to get some G-Fuel before paying any thing on Diablo Immortal?
[2:01:06] metavahn231: why cant these losers just do POE style
[2:01:06] adxx: @Gaphill oh i agree with you 100%, and although $5 isnt really a big deal to me personally, it DOES appear there are items that affect your exp, stats, etc directly. Which i dont like.

[2:02:32] Sollice: @Real_Woman ? This has been the business model of mobile games since you could purchase them. in game purchases are ubiquitous to mobile gaming they arent doing anything new
[2:02:34] mavericks312: the battlepass is worth every penny
[2:02:36] kokochris: ok he did a good job describing
[2:02:44] Ambersulfr: this is 100% how mobile games work, if you don't like it don't play it XD
[2:02:48] Gaphill: @Aquadriel honestly that is every battle / season pass on any game ever, such a shitty design
[2:02:49] sinlesssinner: yea like everyother gatcha game
[2:02:57] Layercake: When the monetization is more complicated than the actual game mechanics HahaThink
[2:02:59] CDubTheRIPper: NODDERS
[2:03:06] Dred_Scythe: Eternal Orbs you CANNOT get in-game
[2:03:15] fewyn: yeah it looks like the same mobile monetization i see everywhere like in Raid
[2:03:17] Carahail: Confused_GeminiMoon gifted a Tier 1 sub to Nim128! They have given 24 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:03:18] gledoc: ye but it takes long times to get they want spend people money in the shop to get it quicker a smart tatic on making money
[2:03:29] imdabestmane: "its ok because everyone else is doing it"
[2:03:30] Dred_Scythe: Eternal Orbs are the in-game first tier currency.
[2:03:35] Real_Woman: @Real_Woman Don't get surprised when the entire gamin industry if filled with this trash, if you keep supporting it.
[2:03:35] Aquadriel: Gaphill welcome to 'modern' gaming my dude. If you look it it for what it is, it is a good deal.
[2:03:36] Dred_Scythe: paid*
[2:03:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: that the main rule of mobile games, there has to be a way no matter how slow it or unlikely there is usually a free way to get something
[2:03:50] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[2:03:52] Ambersulfr: as far as things go, it's much better than war games where you literally drop 100s at a time to fight.
[2:03:56] gledoc: games has become so worse they only make cash shops
[2:03:57] Morpserie: TRUE
[2:04:00] Sincline387: don't you all have phones......
[2:04:05] Gaphill: no I have not tbf
[2:04:05] mavericks312: ppl complain but dokkan battle alone made close to 3 billion last year
[2:04:06] AlbinoOprah: I dont have a phone.
[2:04:06] sinlesssinner: yea nobody is saying that, just saying they ll be taking every other IP they got into mobile if Diablo gets em RICH!
[2:04:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: $5 for the free game those greedy bastards towRee towRee towRee
[2:04:29] gledoc: i know but that is why i hate these games they only care about the cash shop they are worse then wow with there mounts
[2:04:38] mavericks312: @wappedge not really just multilayer games really
[2:04:39] odtee: yeah, don't play mobile games and don't let your kids do it either. get them a PC!
[2:04:43] Ambersulfr: I'm glad they're doing it w/ diablo instead of WoW because that shit will bleed back into the PC game at some point
[2:04:47] kokochris: or pay full price for AAA game and the shit is basically an early access title... _battlefield_ ...
[2:04:59] FranciscoTheMage: morning ... did the PTR com up?
[2:05:00] Ivarjaws: long time no see towel, how is wow these days, worth renewing sub ?
[2:05:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: im just going to play this while im at work or on the toilet so its whatever
[2:05:26] gledoc: its the same with hearstone they announce the game for free but if you wanna have good decks you have to spend 100 of dolars each 6 months to get the new decks
[2:05:36] Aquadriel: ya'll mofos gotta also understand that YOU ARE NOT the target playerbase they aiming for.
[2:05:38] kokochris: @HaxzorJimDuggan thats what I do with Diablo Immortal.  Its pretty awesome actually
[2:05:41] segarth: I hope it's a good poop time game
[2:05:56] kokochris: .. now would be a bad time.
[2:05:58] Day_Walker78: @Towelliee  Eternal Orbs you can't collect in game you have to buy it from the shop

[2:08:11] Nollychi: I've spent a lot on LoL, but cant think its anywhere near 8k :P
[2:08:21] shinta__: I may have spent ~3k across multiple mobile games
[2:08:22] Ambersulfr: but I also haven't subbed for a few months and he's earned it
[2:08:23] Aquadriel: ive never spent money on mobile, but thats cause i havent found a game that interests me enough for it. Immortal might be it.
[2:08:24] Calphurnious: sad part is i bet they don't have all the cards for 8k
[2:08:27] PokerFaceMoose: i spent $5 on pokemon go
[2:08:29] ThatsProto: If youve played wow for 17years

[2:41:39] gledoc: i hate it i spended over 15 year to see how bad it is @Korupcija_
[2:41:39] userrx: too many consle players swich to PC games.. so yeah every game have new players
[2:41:42] joe_g_433: Exactly. New xpac will always be hype. No matter the game.
[2:41:54] Phoxzy: 17 years and still profitable.
[2:41:57] fearkiller1234: i really want wow to be a winner, i feel like the mythic 20  people cap is what hurts wow.. so many people quit the guilds if they get sat and then we all seem to be hurting for pugs.. because everyone left.
[2:42:29] Korupcija_: @wappedge then move on, if the game is dead for you it's not for other millions of players.
[2:42:30] mavericks312: 17 years and still makes the most money
[2:42:33] szble: cross faction will be good
[2:42:37] zarod89: and when we get 10man Mythic back Kappa

[2:42:52] gledoc: i do but wow is just in my head just like evryone els when you play wow over 15 years you cant just get it out of your head @Korupcija_
[2:42:53] Rayzodoom: that would be the best time
[2:42:54] Alepouditsa: i won't cry if the remove horde Kappa
[2:43:04] tebbix: competition makes a game better
[2:43:17] zoovthepally: hopefully the competition helps wow and ff
[2:43:18] gledoc: that is why i watch other players play wow instead of me
[2:43:26] DuploThief: @Towelliee i think wow came out at the right time for a mmo
[2:43:30] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: by the time 10.0 comes around there will be 3 alliance players in total
[2:43:30] Aquadriel: remove pandas too now tht you on it

[2:43:53] Poriand: I want player housing and more reason to do older content
[2:43:56] harris243124: Toweliee is racist against gnomes
[2:43:56] Raaeni: you hate wow so you watch other people play wow so you can complain about how bad it is and why mario cart is better?
[2:43:56] mrmanno14: Gnome lives matter?
[2:44:01] Aquadriel: competition makes aspects of a game better, not the game itself
[2:44:05] Nevindaz: competition betwen mmos makes the mmos better :)
[2:44:07] killswiitch: it's creates toxicity
[2:44:15] fearkiller1234: spo if they do cross faction mythic raiding are they gona do cross faction RBG's?
[2:44:19] gledoc: do you remember the gnome mage chineese guy who got to jail for harrashment on youtube lol
[2:44:19] N7Spectr3: I loved the story and lore I still say, Wotlk and legion were some of the best story telling expansions. Really wish we can get back to that.
[2:44:25] Bronntoise: catJAM
[2:44:38] Coldfire989: You mean besides WoW going to shit due to no competition
[2:44:45] Korupcija_: if they respond to feedback through PTR as they do with tier sets I'll be happy
[2:44:54] tebbix: it supposed to, but yeah you are right we haven't seen something noticeable
[2:44:55] Nevindaz: competition betwen mmos makes the mmos better :)
[2:44:56] balancedlight: @Towelliee How is competitive when there is now real Competitive Alliance mythic raiding
[2:45:01] gledoc: type this on youtube @Towelliee  that chineese mage gnome guy went to prison for this 5 WoW Players That Went TOO FAR!

[2:45:38] Raaeni: wotlk story was pretty bad, wasted the dragon ascpect storyline, put anub'arak as a dungeon boss then retconned it in the same expac, and had a raid where everyone stopped fighting the lich king and had ren faire
[2:45:51] DuploThief: has 34k

[2:51:11] fearkiller1234: dragon soul
[2:51:14] fearkiller1234: and ruby
[2:51:15] Armdel: some of those were alliance guilds that went horde atleast
[2:51:28] GodKingMuninn: alliance didn't even finish that nobody cares about BFA hold over raid hall of fame. Feelsbadman
[2:51:35] SupAngrytroll: so you're telling me there's a chance LUL
[2:51:43] MrWeedoz: has bobby been jailed yet?
[2:52:00] fearkiller1234: hogger
[2:52:07] jkitchin75: @MrWeedoz why would he hes rich
[2:52:15] fearkiller1234: 2042
[2:52:17] balancedlight: so Alliance hasnt been relevant for over12 years got it. So how are they making it more competitive for horde?
[2:52:19] arturiuss44: It will want you to restart your computer
[2:52:21] Armdel: just a launcher update
[2:52:21] luckfore: update
[2:52:25] MrWeedoz: jkitchin75 hoping he annoyed someone even more rich enough
[2:52:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Battlefield 2042 was the lastest for the drivers
[2:52:29] plopptart: icarus
[2:52:30] shinta__: launcher update
[2:52:35] Mecabeast: halo infinite update? campaign comes out next week I think
[2:52:43] VrtniPatuljak: Towelliee launcher update and driver update is separate
[2:52:51] N3llee: @MrWeedoz  no but there has been several formal requests for him to step down from the Coke Cola board.
[2:52:54] MrWeedoz: icarus was that cool survival game with advanced fire physics?
[2:53:12] fearkiller1234: Alliance for sure got hogger world first tho

[2:53:16] otomori: yo go test your skills let's see an SOD heroic lmao
[2:53:32] Vivelli: lol
[2:53:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Icarus is this weekend I think, it looks alright but I don't get into survival ones much
[2:53:39] Nevindaz: KEKW
[2:53:43] balancedlight: so Alliance hasnt been relevant for over12 years got it. So how are they making it more competitive for horde? @Towelliee
[2:53:44] mackieeswe: yea the fire game haha
[2:53:56] N3llee: @MrWeedoz its a slow burn but its happening. Also xbox and sony ceo's are calling for him to step down
[2:54:04] balancedlight: sarcasm sorry
[2:54:06] MrWeedoz: N3llee niiice
[2:54:12] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee Do u still workout? Saw those pictures on IG thats sick
[2:54:26] fearkiller1234: going Night elf for shadowmeld would be awesome witha horde raid
[2:54:27] MrWeedoz: so they finally merging horde and alliance?
[2:54:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Alliance does have some great players, sure
[2:54:32] GodKingMuninn: China might win if they do cross faction
[2:54:32] otomori: you wont have full horde, some of the alliance radicals are good for some classes.
[2:55:02] Mecabeast: maybe cross faction mythic with hall of fame block on cross server till 100 slots are filled?
[2:55:02] MuuskeWoW: !ptr
[2:55:03] Moobot: @MuuskeWoW Servers should be up today in AM after Blizzard wakes up. Looks like Oribos was crashing people. Better to have stable to not be able.
[2:55:05] otomori: why will 10.0 be "different" toweliee?
[2:55:16] AureliusXV: they probably do away with racials
[2:55:17] GodKingMuninn: Ion probs started facing the roster boss during kotick terror and was like 'oh shit, we need this'
[2:55:17] balancedlight: @Towelliee i was being sarcastic to the people that really believe that we should keep the factions seperate
[2:55:22] tebbix: I wonder if they are considering M+ too
[2:55:25] fearkiller1234: i want an undead expansion again, bring back the scourge!
[2:55:26] N3llee: honestly i think cross play should have been made open when they merged the Auction Houses.
[2:55:38] Korupcija_: how will cross faction help if mythic isn't cross realm?
[2:56:03] fearkiller1234: and RBG's
[2:56:05] otomori: if we go cross faction I'm forsure getting benched on alliance lmaooo
[2:56:07] m3rk_zion: Morning Towelliee, how are you today?
[2:56:16] shimwood: It may not be "needed" for M+ but when my guild tried switching to Alliance, M+ was terrible
[2:56:16] squirmyjay: @Towelliee I play on a private wrath server and cross faction is a thing. its great for finding groups
[2:56:49] Raaeni: alliance just doesnt have the amount of high end players as horde does
[2:56:49] Djulio: do you think we'll ever get a break from the "play the patch" gameplay we have in WoW? I've really got tired of doing stuff which is invalidated in next patch
[2:56:53] jostecaptain: Alliance M+ above 20 is abysmal
[2:56:57] Korupcija_: also all alliance are on their servers and horde on their, so should make cross server guilds as well
[2:56:59] fearkiller1234: think Arthas is gona be a good guy now? random thought...
[2:57:18] Ellorg: Ggggggggggggggggggggggggg
[2:57:18] Zinger_z: @Towelliee i remember u trying gw2, what happened?
[2:57:20] RobinDePoppin: I hope they will add Maw Assaults in Zerith Mortis. That would be so hype!
[2:57:22] AureliusXV: there are groups of servers
[2:57:24] RobinDePoppin: Kappa
[2:57:24] merzicdh: @Djulio how many times you post that before he answer you?
[2:57:29] Alexkayzz: If u want stuff that's permanent go collect collectibles
[2:57:30] GodKingMuninn: Cause they needed ripcords

[2:57:53] Korupcija_: I don't see a problem with that
[2:57:58] Nevindaz: KEKW
[2:57:59] gledoc: crash
[2:58:04] Storm0118: well there is only 5 pieces of tier gear though, so someone cant do a 2pc + 4pc if they wanted
[2:58:05] fearkiller1234: lol
[2:58:07] RobinDePoppin: That happened to me in classic
[2:58:08] RobinDePoppin: fuck me
[2:58:18] Mountain_Peace: WHy
[2:58:19] Alexkayzz: Also the way I see it, gear is a tool, with which u get your goal, like CE achievement (which is permanent) so after u get that u don't care about the gear anymore
[2:58:27] balancedlight: @Towelliee  Do you support the romoval of class buffs?
[2:58:29] fearkiller1234: bring out the heart of Azeroth
[2:58:49] Raaeni: werent warlocks going into uldir with the tier set from ToS?
[2:58:50] Thenickradice: how is the state of wow right now? thinking about reactivating the subscription
[2:58:59] Raaeni: before they broke it
[2:59:03] GodKingMuninn: So terrible that players use creative thinking, blizzard doesn't like having to think more than they have too
[2:59:05] Thenickradice: especially with regards to pvp
[2:59:23] falldrgn: Artifacts were honestly cool as hell
[2:59:28] tebbix: true
[2:59:30] FireEmblemLord: ^
[2:59:30] MrWeedoz: so give them only everything instantly, problem solved
[2:59:31] RobinDePoppin: Why not add new features though? Instead of replacing them all the time
[2:59:32] GodKingMuninn: Keep what works, get rid of what doesn't
[2:59:34] RobinDePoppin: we still dont have housing
[2:59:39] Raaeni: i would have hated if the weapons continued
[2:59:39] roostrr42: Yup
[2:59:49] shimwood: Just give us Artifact weapons, but recolor them Kappa
[2:59:49] fearkiller1234: yeh legion is the best recent expansion because of those artifact weapons
[2:59:53] Raaeni: would waste the weapon slot for every expansion after
[2:59:57] GodKingMuninn: Imagine Artifact weps with Corruption xD
[3:00:04] FireEmblemLord: housing will be ground breaking in 10
[3:00:04] RobinDePoppin: but FF14 doesnt do that
[3:00:05] falldrgn: oh god...
[3:00:06] Ziddrax: or just add new systems but make the older usefull
[3:00:09] GeoSourge: imaginers DansGame
[3:00:13] Khlaro: Then they come up with something new and people STILL complain about it. duckKekw
[3:00:18] ThatsProto: Borrowed power keeps the game fresh
[3:00:20] Thenickradice: I think my favorite expansion system and pvp wise was mists of pandaria
[3:00:23] roostrr42: Just keep everything the same 4Head
[3:00:24] fearkiller1234: i think the thing about the artifact weapons, which made them so cool was being able to change the skins and unlock new skins
[3:00:26] chronoit: the balancing would become a problem with multiple systems
[3:00:27] ThatsProto: The problem is when its associated to a huge grind
[3:00:33] ARROOCE: "but FF14 does this and that" 🤓
[3:00:34] fearkiller1234: its in your inventory
[3:00:37] ThatsProto: Because its temporary, it doesnt feel worthwhile
[3:00:38] Honvar: the wand is in your bag
[3:00:39] berrydelish: Not really. They don't have to constantly make new systems if any of the "new systems" were good. Then they could've just expanded upon them instead of removing them each expansion.
[3:00:46] darthcrabman: Blizzard Trying to make to many different people happy
[3:00:48] GodKingMuninn: I think artifact weps should of atleast become heirlooms, like what WoD did
[3:00:49] BroseidonGaming: Check your inventory
[3:00:56] RobinDePoppin: They do it right though
[3:00:59] chronoit: FF14 has no class choice. they just have static classes with static abilities
[3:00:59] fearkiller1234: wand is in your bags

[3:01:10] RobinDePoppin: @chronoit ? KEKW
[3:01:22] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee  Thats inverted, they admitted they make the expansion thematic around their systems lol
[3:01:23] berrydelish: Right. So that's why they're making new systems because they tailored them to expansions instead of creating a system that can go past 1 expansion.
[3:01:29] MrWeedoz: here's hoping they'd add some core stuff that can be used through expansions and also have exp specific talents
[3:02:01] gledoc: its sheet
[3:02:02] Secondbreakfasttt: towStop towIt
[3:02:04] Typh166: One of my issues now why I hold back on Shadowlands systems because it means nothing for the next expansion.
[3:02:04] diat357: @chronoit did you ever play FF14 or you are Wow candy?
[3:02:07] GodKingMuninn: 3 more minutes of ads? wtf I just had 3 minutes of then 10 minutes ago
[3:02:11] Mr_Pennywise_: wow 9 ads lol this is silly

[3:02:18] RobinDePoppin: An expansion in wow means an entire new game not an expansion of the main game
[3:02:22] fearkiller1234: so many ads..
[3:02:26] gledoc: i dont get any ads @Mr_Pennywise_
[3:02:29] zardistus: @kudr357 you're new here aren't ya
[3:02:30] Raaeni: @Typh166 are you skipping 10.0 too because the systems wont carry on to 11.0?
[3:02:35] Honvar: The wand is in your bag @Towelliee
[3:02:36] AureliusXV: i dont get ads either
[3:02:50] RobinDePoppin: Nuke.
[3:03:00] darthcrabman: I really liked the class halls and artifact weapons
[3:03:02] flazy_2595: bring back class spec talent trees
[3:03:05] Alepouditsa: @AureliusXV it is country bace i think i don;t get a lot coz i am from greece
[3:03:14] AureliusXV: im na
[3:03:15] Thenickradice: any pvp players in here that can speak on the current state of pvp? thinking about activating my subscription.
[3:03:18] Korupcija_: systems are fine, grind is too long
[3:03:20] Armdel: gotta hit them engagement numbers man
[3:03:25] RobinDePoppin: I play classic more then retail bcz its actually fun
[3:03:28] MrWeedoz: well, bliz can blame em selves for ppl wanting all instantly, wasn't there some really autoplay expansions or something?
[3:03:32] brozzy: Just make legion 2.0 and everyone will be happy
[3:03:32] Etsku: man its weird looking at wow after playing tons of new world LUL
[3:03:33] AureliusXV: 2021 lol
[3:03:35] Baladore: Well, whatever they are doing, it's being proven to not be working.
[3:03:49] RobinDePoppin: @Towelliee What do you think about proffs in retail? I feel like they dont do anything
[3:03:55] showmethesugar35: And thats why you lose players. You force your players to play the game and make them want to play the game.
[3:03:59] Gingerprimer: Yeah ppl want new content/systems. Only problem with borrowed power is that since Legion the borrowed power has not been as fun
[3:04:01] jkitchin75: @VelzenTV classic fun lol ok
[3:04:10] SpyCrabbo: i will never forget how they said there's no more artifact power, also go grind some azerite instead
[3:04:19] RobinDePoppin: @jkitchin75 Community and proffessions are 10x better in classic
[3:04:30] RobinDePoppin: u can actually be a crafter in classic
[3:04:31] jkitchin75: @VelzenTV ok
[3:04:39] Thunder4o: @Towelliee Gamers in 2021 want when they level their char to have bis gear in Mail box,so after that they will whine in a week there is no content in the game
[3:04:53] Aquadriel: its at the main place
[3:04:56] Honvar: The big guy at the portal @Towelliee
[3:05:07] Honvar: the wand is in your bag @Towelliee
[3:05:07] Jeanssi: fangcrack surprises em
[3:05:13] RuineMi: The structure was fine, legions was basically perfect by the end, the start of bfa and having to grind more neck levels just to get the same azerite you were using but on higher ilvl was meh
[3:05:13] fearkiller1234: open your bags
[3:05:19] Nevindaz: go to the right portal
[3:05:26] mrrazputin: wand is in eq
[3:05:30] DarkMoonDragons: Target enemy wand becomes world extra action button
[3:05:30] theszoti: these covenant assaults are so lame
[3:05:31] fearkiller1234: lol dude
[3:05:32] Jeanssi: you have wand in your bags
[3:05:33] Nevindaz: check inventory
[3:05:36] fearkiller1234: your wand is in the bag
[3:05:36] Jeanssi: blue wand
[3:05:39] zardistus: bro.  bag
[3:05:42] zardistus: check it
[3:05:43] logdrop69: bag brother

[3:05:56] zardistus: lawl
[3:05:57] fearkiller1234: in bags
[3:05:57] mrrazputin: you just dont have quest out
[3:05:58] Honvar: And the suprise mobs are at the portal there
[3:05:58] MrWeedoz: old school mmo feel, gotta find your items from your own bags D:
[3:06:01] Secondbreakfasttt: i understand grind but i do not accept when put rng in it like korthia . fckn hell
[3:06:21] Rayzodoom: what's odd is its normally to the side of the quest
[3:06:24] fearkiller1234: gotta shrink em then kill em
[3:06:34] Jeanssi: go east on map the guy is grabbing mobs of torghast portal = surprised mobs
[3:06:45] MrWeedoz: mellkorrrrr yea rng rewards are not really good in grindy games, think if you'd work 9 to 7 for a month and it's a raffle if you get 50% or 100% of your paycheck
[3:07:00] Secondbreakfasttt: and what about legos, just put all of them dungeon loot table already
[3:07:04] Honvar: that guy is where the suprised adds are
[3:07:07] fearkiller1234: can you step on em?

[3:10:28] Maxson86: @Towelliee is there to much to do in retail atm?
[3:10:39] galinhoo: Is it normal for a ptr patch to take this long to be up?
[3:10:48] fearkiller1234: idk man getting fairy wings from ardenweld is worth all my subscription money
[3:10:58] Andymint: it's silly to me that people think the grind in this xpac is worse than Legion or BFA. it's not
[3:10:58] m3rk_zion: So how is the PTR This time around?
[3:11:04] TheUnknowing: Its not a bandwagon if the expansion is kind of universally disliked. lol, but every one is entitled to an opinion, I don't doubt there are some of have loved shadowlands so far.
[3:11:04] bawheid: bad expansion and toxic company seen many unsubs
[3:11:12] niebvelungen: This week i tried ff14 and i have to say even leveling is much more fun than shadowlands. I have 30h played now
[3:11:16] TheHardcorian: Shadowlands deserves all the shit its getting, unless we speak up blizz will not improve, it was a trash expansion overall with moments of goodness.
[3:11:17] luckfore: this isnt the PTR FailFish
[3:11:58] halfug: shadowlands started turning it around in 9.1.5. its's actually enjoyable now
[3:12:02] TheHardcorian: WubTF I know this place *PTSD increases*
[3:12:04] Mecabeast: they should make world quests drop a token that can be exchanged for conduit upgrades would of made grinding  in sl feel better

[3:12:17] FresheFefe: shadowlands start was pretty amazing, but the whole vibe  is a bit off
[3:12:18] galinhoo: I have a feeling that they rushed this build to have testing on the ff14 release
[3:12:21] Kromede: IonJam
[3:12:30] merzicdh: you expect chat to actually read? smh
[3:12:39] fearkiller1234: will the new FF expansion have more voice acting in it?
[3:13:00] MrWeedoz: oof, limiting options to enjoy content is not proper way to push out content
[3:13:04] Mortianto: Mortianto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 94 months! 
[3:13:05] halfug: the problem wit h shadowlands was that i couldnt play multiple specs cus of the covenant restrictions, which felt horrible, being locked in
[3:13:17] Sielu11628: "make sure to set aside enough time for the following cutscenes" x 15!
[3:13:19] fearkiller1234: nice!

[3:29:39] ZakuzaGB: i played league of legends for like 6 years and just had enough and never went back
[3:29:40] Gingerprimer: @stevegodx ppl would get hyped for patches if the game got more than 1 content patch each year

[3:29:51] Milanesa_De_Pollo: any news when PTR will be up?
[3:29:52] Ziddrax: or just play the end of the expansion
[3:29:53] PandaTV: ive been saying that for years @Towelliee like sure SL is pretty dogshit but like at SOME point no matter what they do you will stop enjoying the game. if i quit tomorrow ive got 17 YEARS out of this game thats INSANE
[3:29:55] miniomniculturistical: People don’t quit wow they just take breaks lol
[3:29:59] mavericks312: @gingerprimer in a normal year it does
[3:29:59] reffan: I like the people who play it (my guild) but not the game
[3:30:01] TheHardcorian: Aw man I miss Legion
[3:30:07] Masqerader: in other words its a personal problem
[3:30:08] Reckless_Monk: Maybe.. You should go to New World, where you can cut down trees.. and duplicate items and gear @towelliee :)
[3:30:08] diat357: imagine releasing only one major patch for year is really bad development
[3:30:09] fearkiller1234: play raid shadowlegends
[3:30:09] XandrahDragoness: wow will always be in my heart, played it since the start, and its still here, I honestly dont think its going anywhere.
[3:30:10] grimpache: That sunk cost fallacy
[3:30:10] ExtreemeCheese: I love the game, but the content droughts are what drive me away
[3:30:19] Korupcija_: when I quit dota for league I didn't go to dota streams saying dota is dead LUL
[3:30:23] finejeez1: i havent really like wow since legion unfortunately =(
[3:30:23] Nevindaz: HOPIUM
[3:30:33] temp3st98: SL was the first time i quit wow and i liked most of the expansions
[3:30:34] Jeanssi: yeah just play the end and beginning, the best times
[3:30:42] Masqerader: im gonna quit until TD comeback.... 20 years like 8.4 classic bfa
[3:31:02] Gingerprimer: @mavericks312 yeah and that is what I mean like 8.3 had decent hype behind it and so on buy since SL has only gotten one proggresion patch this year
[3:31:08] SupAngrytroll: LUL
[3:31:19] XandrahDragoness: I am a little dissappointed with New World though...
[3:31:25] Mr_Pennywise_: monkaSoap
[3:31:34] ispyyro: FF14 Just dropped an new trailer with a collaboration with SIA. Looks stunning.
[3:31:36] tebbix: DH TD that was fun
[3:31:39] shiasuns: i mean corruption was the most obnoxious but fun shit ive ever played
[3:31:55] XandrahDragoness: It does, as I was enjoying it levelling with the hammer squad was great, but the devs seem a little confused, or need help.
[3:31:59] TheHardcorian: The last time I found wows story engrossing was Legion with Illidan, man what the cinematics...just hope we get back to those times.
[3:32:00] fearkiller1234: they just need chocobos in wow...that will bring back the player base
[3:32:01] Domi98_: game is built on a very bad code

[3:33:37] ChiefBeard: I log in to craft the legendary resources only at this point.
[3:33:41] Atrox93: How is the new patch?
[3:34:11] Gingerprimer: @Masqerader to be honest most big hype games shits the bed
[3:34:13] syro_live: is ff14 mainly a pve game ?
[3:34:15] YoloSmokinDoloSolo: everyones gonna come back to full server then complain they cant get in LUL
[3:34:16] 無職提督: i mean only if the trading post wasnt shutdown every week let me do my 200 crafting leveling, sad man
[3:34:22] Gingerprimer: @syro_live yes
[3:34:33] ZakuzaGB: that jailers gauntlet sounds interesting
[3:34:35] fearkiller1234: i just enjoyed cutting down trees
[3:34:41] fearkiller1234: best part of new world
[3:34:41] Alexkayzz: he's just gonna cry man
[3:34:49] Wcvechten: dubstep remix of his theme, obviously
[3:34:52] z01z: nothing like the FF boss music tho
[3:34:54] RageerPLZ: I just watched my lich king heroic kill video after my raid day, 2010 man good times
[3:34:54] Nevindaz: Anduin helped by Arthas? towSmile
[3:35:00] tebbix: @Alexkayzz true LUL
[3:35:02] Korupcija_: the word is "lit" nowdays
[3:35:06] TheHardcorian: His dad shows up...Anduin cries like a bitch KEKW
[3:35:08] Nevindaz: Anduin freed by Arthas towSmile
[3:35:11] Atrox93: xD
[3:35:20] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[3:35:26] Tia214: towCringe towCringe
[3:35:38] deadman385: Lol
[3:35:42] mett7: its not over son, time to Azeroth Reborn Kappa
[3:35:43] MikalasRaynor: that and varian might tell him to eat his vegetables
[3:35:44] itsly0n: father i crave violance
[3:35:46] undisputedmoe: When is the ptr?
[3:35:49] fearkiller1234: is varyian and arthus gona tag team the jailor?
[3:35:50] Galadeon: So he will appear as a green dust cloud?
[3:35:53] z01z: it probably was going to be and then they decided to cut 9.3
[3:36:00] Wcvechten: Either that or it's going to be another Avatar of Sargeras case
[3:36:07] o__mj__o: Anduin fight harder than Sylvanas fight .. thats fun
[3:36:14] Apokolipz: suddenly  arthas  shows up weilding  Light's Vengeance and saves anduin's soul
[3:36:20] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Do you think Anduin was meant as the original 9.2 boss with Jailer being 9.3 boss before the scrapped 9.3?
[3:36:22] Cafe0le: anduin was probably the last boss of 9.1 or 9.2 before they scrapped 9.3
[3:36:27] AkuTVgg: Anduin 100% was supposed to be 9.2 last boss with Jailer being 9.3 but then things got condensed
[3:36:41] ThatsProto: Gear scaling kinda takes care of that
[3:36:43] tebbix: I like that
[3:36:57] ChiefBeard: I pug mythic
[3:36:59] Masqerader: Wrathion is gonna show up and tell us about a cloak to save Anduin. and with true loves first kiss break the jailer spell
[3:37:22] Korupcija_: new guilds arise as well though
[3:37:26] blitzenlol: maybe nerf everything but the last boss?
[3:37:31] Dankmanarmy: Fights like painsmith are still freaking hard for casual guilds
[3:37:37] Galadeon: @masqerader So a kiss from Sylvanas?
[3:37:38] Rudric_Ice: GIT GUD ION prolly
[3:37:38] ArroArroArro: Somehow my guild has survived, we have almost hundreds of applications every month from 3-5/10M players where the guilds died. Than you have hundreds of 9/10 people despretly trying to get CE @Towelliee
[3:37:47] Recording_on_the_grass: NotLikeThis
[3:37:51] fearkiller1234: ph shit maybe garrosh is gona come through the wall and beat up the jailor with arthas
[3:37:52] Deathdealer1837: @Towelliee  i love Max from Limit take on raids and the game. he's a firm believer of giving more of the game back to casusls instead of the 1%er's
[3:38:03] Jeanssi: it's a skill issue
[3:38:04] itsly0n: 10 man raiding pls. It's so hard to find 20 ppl
[3:38:06] Korupcija_: 1.2k M sylvanas kills for now
[3:38:11] Gingerprimer: @Dankmanarmy yeah my guild that is around 6/10 myhtic each tier is struggling hard atm on painsmith with 100+ pulls
[3:38:12] blitzenlol: @Dankmanarmy the tradeoff for painsmith is that most of the raid is super easy
[3:38:13] Aidler: until recently you couldn't even solo some old legion raid encounters
[3:38:43] Wcvechten: also think difficulty curve could be more smoother in raids tbh
[3:38:43] Moobot: Check out all of the new changes for WoW Classic Season of Mastery at Wowhead! https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/season-of-mastery-som-overview-wow-classic
[3:38:45] Gingerprimer: @Aidler that was due to the sl scaling
[3:38:52] fearkiller1234: just make mythic raiding scale?! its that easy
[3:38:53] Domi98_: isn't that what LFR is for
[3:38:56] Cafe0le: wow will never catch up to ffxiv in casual content, just focus on combat and classes
[3:39:11] Jeanssi: 1000% this
[3:39:18] miniomniculturistical: But people hate when day content is added like LFR for casuals
[3:39:24] Ponkan92: They did? it is super easy now?
[3:39:27] kaihole: @fearkiller1234 easier said than done lol
[3:39:28] Rayzodoom: thought they did in 9.1.5
[3:39:29] Demanisraar: yeah Antorus is still shite to do and tomb last two bosses also
[3:39:34] Katrikan: @Towelliee the music mix you hear, do you have a link to share plz?
[3:39:37] Gingerprimer: It is kind of no brain now since 9.1.5
[3:39:42] blitzenlol: @Towelliee legion is older than that
[3:39:42] Korupcija_: I kinda liked when I was farming lich king for mount in MoP and it was hard
[3:39:46] im_n0t_jezus: they dont want to give the players what they want as ALWAYS
[3:39:47] DewWut: try 5 years old LUL
[3:39:52] politimi_72: @Towelliee before that they wanted to legacy mode it after 11+ levels. Its Stupid
[3:39:57] jason_shade: Happy Holidays buddy. They've just lost the plot on this game unfortunately. Hope they just clean house at some point in the future
[3:40:06] Deathdealer1837: i would love to have more of the alt consideration back in the game. make more things account bound vs having to work everything on every toon. I personally thought renow should have been account wide
[3:40:06] YoloSmokinDoloSolo: wouldnt be a prob if stat values didnt jump from 1000s to millions then to 100s
[3:40:07] ArroArroArro: also semi hardcore players want to play multible characters doing some +20 keys or reclear on an alt but its still unbearble to catch up to raid
[3:40:07] Secondbreakfasttt: i don't think it's hard to tune it, they are just stubborn for some reason and it's insane makes me puke
[3:40:08] Gingerprimer: Both Tomb/and antorus are super easy now
[3:40:34] XaviAir: time to pull a Realm Reborn and reset stuff
[3:40:39] Secondbreakfasttt: @Gingerprimer they are lietraly not
[3:40:45] luckfore: all they have to do is change damage multiplier, it takes 30sec to change
[3:40:51] Elff11: KJ is a bigger meme then me, and I play a survival hunter in mythic raiding :D
[3:40:53] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Anyone know if 10.0 was supposed to be announced this Blizzcon?
[3:40:58] Casturnax: Because they're lazy and think they know better. It's not hard to add at all.
[3:41:05] miniomniculturistical: Yeah old content offers no other value than xmog anyway
[3:41:10] deadman385: Don’t say KJ around the bois
[3:41:11] Demanisraar: LUL no
[3:41:16] Demanisraar: fuck no
[3:41:17] Wcvechten: Imagine that for KJ, G'huun
[3:41:23] ArroArroArro: or maybe than they can tune it better?
[3:41:25] Valestrus: whats "no echo" mode?
[3:41:26] Korupcija_: I strongly believe nobody would do that in WoW
[3:41:29] fearkiller1234: i feel like wow messed up by not having like a legacy old raid boss raid and we fight their souls or something in shadowlands
[3:41:30] DewWut: @XaviAir yep, world calamity event reseting everything
[3:41:34] NVbrutal: just give us a 20-30% damage buff in old raids similar to the icc buff.
[3:41:41] Demanisraar: G'huun can suck my weiner.. never going back there again on mythic
[3:41:52] Alexkayzz: yeah that's what I did
[3:42:08] OriginalCloudy: this the guy from big time rush
[3:42:13] Korupcija_: do you think that's normal player behavior though?
[3:42:17] giggz91: ptr?
[3:42:24] XaviAir: @DewWut the lore is so messed up that it can only be fixed by a mega calamity and we let thousands of years pass
[3:42:26] OriginalCloudy: im sorry
[3:42:40] xideontv: the rare choreghast strema
[3:42:50] Deathdealer1837: explain that
[3:42:53] Deathdealer1837: please
[3:42:59] luckfore: morgan day said they now have tools to very easily scale old content
[3:43:10] DiminutiveSnowman: its kinda wild how 14 tries to keep all its content evergreen and wow is like "why would you ever do a dungeon/raid that isnt from the current patch?"
[3:43:15] Gingerprimer: Sounds good
[3:43:16] DewWut: @XaviAir yep, massive time jump would be cool
[3:43:20] Aidler: but that should be some timewalking version of old raids that is constantly available
[3:43:22] ArroArroArro: No you dont need a grind to keep people playing. you only need FUN SHIT!
[3:43:24] Demanisraar: Renown would have been fine if they didn't put the soulbinds behind it
[3:43:28] TheHardcorian: I agree with the battlepass idea
[3:43:30] Demanisraar: and korthia
[3:43:49] DeanoTV: no grind like WoD - kill casual playerbase
[3:43:52] ArroArroArro: how much did people play games without anything to gain just cause it was fucking fun!!!, just make the game fun and people will play it
[3:43:54] Alexkayzz: I agree, but not make it like an actual obvious battle pass, still keep it MMOish, like the renown
[3:44:01] ShowDUH: You won't have access to Halo shit after season is done tho lol
[3:44:03] fearkiller1234: i came into shadowlands totally expecting to see all the people we killed and them wanting revenge or something... the only one they hit the mark on was uther..
[3:44:03] assman_ny: That is a really good idea
[3:44:12] Gingerprimer: @Showduh yes you do
[3:44:14] Layercake: Halo is really the worst example  HahaThink
[3:44:29] miniomniculturistical: I think it’s more to stop people from finishing contest too early and complain they have no content
[3:44:33] Secondbreakfasttt: they are still timegating old content. if you wanna open some artifact skins, it's still atleast 2 reset for raid loot. holly shit whats's wrong with you
[3:44:47] DrWraithjr: That would be super cool
[3:44:51] ShowDUH: guess i was misinformed @Gingerprimer then only the Tenrai even stuff prolly wont follow
[3:45:02] XaviAir: @DewWut just have the jailer end reality, and have a gigantic time jump
[3:45:06] o__mj__o: giving us free month .. nope never :D
[3:45:10] Alepouditsa: you mean to party with others? danBlank
[3:45:11] o__mj__o: -15$
[3:45:15] TheHardcorian: Or daily login rewards

[3:46:12] yokai_5: bruh you have to buy 300k gold worth of legendaries in 9.2 if you're gearing up an alt
[3:46:12] miniomniculturistical: Do you think people would lash out if they add cross faction raiding ?
[3:46:15] Korupcija_: I don't think battle pass has place in wow
[3:46:22] xideontv: grinding SUCKS
[3:46:24] Secondbreakfasttt: they took ideas and make them worse lmao
[3:46:25] koko316: towHi

[3:46:36] Demanisraar: @omnitown I myself would be fine with it.. makes finding groups better
[3:46:46] galinhoo: I like the idea, I don't trust blizzard with it LUL
[3:46:50] Rudric_Ice: Bo can be cool
[3:46:52] xideontv: battle pass sounds good though. big reason i play hearthstone
[3:46:52] XaviAir: I mean, instead of adding stuff to mask that your game is a snoozefest of systems, why not fix it?
[3:46:53] Deathdealer1837: line across
[3:46:55] Rudric_Ice: bp
[3:46:56] Notsure770: Blizzard needs to put Towelliee on the payroll as an advisor.  Problems solved.
[3:46:57] Mecabeast: they're nice cause you know after x levels you'll get y cosmetic
[3:47:03] ShowDUH: @omnitown why would we last out ? lol we want it

[3:48:43] fearkiller1234: i want to be big numbers again like the last patch of BFA
[3:48:48] Demanisraar: MAke me get a kul tiran bald one-eyed fat paladin and I will play 10.0 LUL
[3:48:50] XaviAir: FFXIV has no battle pass tho
[3:48:52] NVbrutal: wow needs a complete overhaul on alot of the features to keep it fresh and feeling new.
[3:48:53] Morderon: @Towelliee  its a thing of F2P games
[3:48:55] Secondbreakfasttt: @N3llee yeah basicly he says it has become a work.
[3:49:02] Alepouditsa: what is a battel pass?
[3:49:02] Korupcija_: but wow doesn't need it, we just need faster content
[3:49:03] MagicMooseMoo: Ff14 will have a battle pass like system for pvp
[3:49:05] Deathdealer1837: @Towelliee  i still dont understand the battle passes. call me old but can you explain those please
[3:49:07] mrsolo0: if they just listen to the community wow would be a 100 time better @Towelliee
[3:49:08] DuploThief: i think legendary Gear is to expensive for a casual player i don't have the gold tot make a 262 best i can make is like 225 and that feels bad
[3:49:09] ShowDUH: @fearkiller1234 that was nowhere big numbers lol you didn't play legion
[3:49:12] oldmangamer0: Thats a really good idea towelliee
[3:49:13] Ahh_Choo: I like battle passes
[3:49:14] Demanisraar: true, wow needs to be wow
[3:49:14] Rudric_Ice: WOW BATTLE ROYAL
[3:49:21] Alegnowar: i hope they're ready to fire all the cannon they have over at blizzard for 10.0, the game needs a huge shake-up
[3:49:25] XaviAir: wow also had a foundational game
[3:49:27] Korupcija_: BUT FINAL FANTASY TOWELLIEE
[3:49:45] miniomniculturistical: people were crying for something like Dungeon finder in TBC and now people say that killed wows community  when everybody loved it in Wrath
[3:49:50] fearkiller1234: how come we didnt get any allied races in shadowlands? isnt that strange?
[3:49:51] bonkyouded: We are paying to play the game already if they put in a battle pass with a paywall im out, period. never coming back because that is just beyond greed

[4:18:57] Raaeni: @Raaeni the vault goes up to 252 currently, reason stands that it will be the same mythic ilvl as all but the last few bosses in 9.2, and if they can get that ilvl the forge can turn it into tier

[4:20:26] Aro725: @Raaeni I wouldnt hold my breath for this to work. and even if it did you have to rng shoulders at 252 to get your tier"? itll be sick to get a belt everyweek you dont need
[4:20:29] Alegnowar: they put a lot of work into diablo immortal, remember when back in 2018 everyone said it was just a reskinned chinese mobile game, it looks like they worked on it a ton

[4:43:52] royalnader: But Savage release gonna hit hard.
[4:43:57] Kisswani: Star wars there are too many story options to spoil it for you

[4:44:07] xhale2nhale: @Alegnowar I think it'll be mid next year not end
[4:44:11] Rodorann: i couldnt get into FF

[4:44:41] Dankmanarmy: I dont find ffxiv as fun to watch as other games
[4:45:10] ribose1982: I didnt read patch noted and wanted to finish 5.5 and 5.55 tonight before endwalker tomorrow but didnt realise servers would be down :(

[4:45:22] Nevindaz: and to not be TOXIC
[4:45:30] Aquadriel: no shitting on FF, but after watching soda go through some of the cutscenes, i was thankful wow doesnt do that. They dont look awesome and voice acting is a bit off to me. WoW ingame cinematics are as 'bad' so i am thankful we dont have long ones lol
[4:45:35] reyvin40: i mute the browser and not the channel.  Always worried about the ad revenue
[4:45:47] Nevindaz: yea and trying to not be TOXIC
[4:46:04] TompsonX: I love Final Fantasy, I just think World of Warcraft has smoother gameplay,
[4:46:07] KappaMS2: ya mean u actually have to play the game? lol
[4:46:25] Kisswani: because you set up your UI , you're more used to it in WoW . it makes sense to be relaxed with it in general I think
[4:46:25] syro_live: i feel like the polished animations and all those effects distract me and are a little bit of an overload for me
[4:46:54] Sarkerius: I'm trying to level as a counsular in SWTOR... But its kinda borring. Think I'm gonna have to start over as something els
[4:46:57] CrunkyBrewster: yeah i do it that way
[4:47:05] Cochese_: JP is much better
[4:47:07] Vivelli: theres alot of debate on dub vs sub
[4:47:08] Aquadriel: I bet it is. JRPG dubs dont make it for me @Towelliee
[4:47:10] Kisswani: I did that for post ARR MSQ , otherwise I would have quit

[4:47:24] Eraste: sub andies KEKW
[4:47:25] shinta__: I may need to try change it to japanesse. For me the english voice acting is rough
[4:47:31] xhale2nhale: yea I use original language for alot  of my games n such
[4:47:32] Aquadriel: @Towelliee i had that issue with nier automata, tried english dub and didnt like it, went JP voice and was MIIILES better
[4:47:44] Armdel: ive played the game for 3 years with jp voices
[4:47:54] 12months: i dont like FF14 cause you have to read A LOT
[4:47:54] Boredslide: Yeah, i used JP for voice, it is much smoother
[4:47:55] Nevindaz: KEKW
[4:48:01] jaacobjames: how many attempts do you have on this mount ??
[4:48:03] Einzbern: max reading dialogue KEKW

[4:48:08] mavericks312: nah there skipping lol
[4:48:11] xhale2nhale: I think Max said in one his streams he don't care for the story

[5:18:43] CF_Affinity: !PTR
[5:18:43] Moobot: @CF_Affinity Servers should be up today in AM after Blizzard wakes up. Looks like Oribos was crashing people. Better to have stable to not be able.
[5:18:49] TheFuriyon: If you got to the end of the story you could hear that a lot of sound design was missing
[5:18:49] evilxsight: I haven't played world of warcraft for almost 2 years - is it worth going back now? is it any better than BFA?

[5:21:58] zackmcquack: exactly
[5:22:02] TheFuriyon: Lance Master is gonna be my main when that comes out
[5:22:06] RoboMaximillion: but its janky outside of combat
[5:22:08] Poriand: weird they are taking summoner away and adding sorc. why cant we have both at launch
[5:22:09] ExpectDragons: I read we're not getting destroyer on launch
[5:22:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: diablo with a controller feels good so i would do lost ark with one
[5:22:25] ChidaRL: @HaxzorJimDuggan yeah, but going through menus on controller is horrible
[5:22:29] Thoriakk: I just misunderstood what you said, what will be your main in Lost Ark ?
[5:22:34] pereadin: sadge

[5:23:44] EvoCyberNation: Yeah, new world isn't doing good at all.
[5:23:54] Thoriakk: will paladin be your main ?
[5:23:54] dym_jt: each server has multiple "layers" (channels) that you can freely move between.
[5:24:15] EvoCyberNation: That's what everyone wants. They've worked on the "Back bone" of the server merge
[5:24:19] ijuki: towD
[5:24:20] KillaPr0: i read they are working on it

[5:25:21] kokochris: @sydbarrett71 I use Razer Trinity,  so I can switch between MMO or FPS mode as needed.   Been using Razr for many years.
[5:25:32] im_capy: They didnt think it out prior, they just did it and said we will think about how to fix it later
[5:25:34] EvoCyberNation: We're sure we can possibly fix it, but we're pretty sure there won't be any new bugs... almost promise it.

[5:56:51] xXSiebzehnXx: WoW got blitzed last year. It was almost like the industry was waiting for them. Maybe Blizz threw off for this expansion because they knew, and 10.0 is gonna blow us away towTinfoil

[5:56:56] axellent_x: legion, the xpac that ripped a lot of the diablo 3 systems
[5:56:58] Kimdah_: Every MMO has a ton of players at start (same with new WoW expacs) but it always cools down.
[5:57:00] Glenadel: Copium...
[5:57:00] papaheals: Lol if you actually think bliz had that little subs
[5:57:03] brodycanuck: Legion was the best modern WoW xpac by a long shot
[5:57:03] Raaeni: i hated legion, left after 1 month and didnt come back until 7.3

[5:57:33] smashwow: 10.0 has to be better than legion. it has to show the dev's are listening and using the feedback. not just saying we hear you and frankly just get better Kappa
[5:57:37] cazhually: heard max from limit talking about yesterday how they rehired bubba who helped majorly with their nylotha and castle nathria wins
[5:57:49] Kimdah_: Legion start made me cry like a baby tbh

[6:04:10] nerdtopia: im joking obvy @Molvonos
[6:04:12] N3llee: and it was cleared by the 2nd day of woltk
[6:04:13] smashwow: @Towelliee soooo if WotLK wasn't there you wouldn't have gotten that raid. where's the BFA magni tat? Kappa
[6:04:21] Buttscratchrr: when did you first playing wow ?
[6:04:23] cyb0rg_007: Wow was still kinda behind doors at that time
[6:04:28] gidgeet: The Zones were pretty in Wrath
[6:04:37] mikejames01: with warcraft RTS there would be no wow BUt i get it
[6:04:39] pereadin: HM took quite a few weeks iirc
[6:04:40] brodycanuck: @wokein I wish it was still that way

[6:04:47] idenkaz_: crystal forest, pretty zones but underused Sadge
[6:05:06] Aquadriel: 8.1
[6:05:07] Thv_: This will be my first PTR so sorry if you’ve been asked this a lot. Do we know a time estimate of when PTR will be updated?
[6:05:18] Jokervenom1978: 8.2 was a great patch
[6:05:19] Nokterian: I liked Horrific  Visions it was challenging @Towelliee
[6:05:21] smashwow: 8.2 and 8.3 was good if you were current on your grinds.
[6:05:23] N3llee: just naxx was cleared 2nd day
[6:05:24] brodycanuck: TBC was goat
[6:05:24] Aquadriel: except for no boa essences
[6:05:26] xViewersunitedx: tbc is pretty great^
[6:05:27] shiny_flaaffy: that was legion for me
[6:05:31] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: 8.3 had so many sick classes
[6:05:34] Siglius: @thv_ Last update was within this hour, but no other estimate
[6:05:36] Oakengrove: Corruption was the worst
[6:05:38] Recording_on_the_grass: Legion
[6:05:43] cryft: burning legion sympathizer
[6:05:48] Thunder4o: for me Legion is by far the best expansion
[6:05:49] N3llee: you were literally the only one.
[6:05:49] mikejames01: MOP was my top one still love it
[6:05:53] Thv_: @siglius  so should be done soon?
[6:05:54] gidgeet: Mop was my overall Favorite Expansion
[6:05:56] luckfore: @thv_ expecting it this hour but well see
[6:06:02] mmrghost7: legion was perfect , all hail legion
[6:06:03] Thv_: As in it’s the last update coming
[6:06:12] nerdtopia: BC LUL
[6:06:16] Oakengrove: First half of Legion sucked
[6:06:17] mytherel: MOP was amazballs
[6:06:19] Smokebear: Legion was the best of the best and was the beginning of the real end
[6:06:28] Xerevil: Shadowlands has been the worst xpac for me personally even WoD didn't keep me away for this long lol
[6:06:28] Kelticlore: WOD was great
[6:06:34] smashwow: cata > SL = WOD
[6:06:37] zhc_: no it wasnt great
[6:06:37] Nokterian: Shadowlands is lower just beneath WoD
[6:06:39] SethRonin: lol never thought id hear that
[6:06:40] luckfore: Wod > SL > Cata
[6:06:41] nerdtopia: cata was way better than shadowlands lol
[6:06:43] vetements07: Remember you getting the legendary from the blingtron box @towelliee
[6:06:46] Nevindaz: not even 4.0.6 ?
[6:06:47] Sheerphenom: You are insane thinking that BFA was in any way better than WoD.  WoD was a fantastic expansion with amazing raids.  It gave freedom to not be sucked into the game 24/7
[6:06:52] FresheFefe: cata had nice pvp
[6:06:53] Siglius: @thv_ With a bit of luck and if Blizz doesn't run into technical issues.
[6:06:55] Y_U_CRYIN: Y_U_CRYIN subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! WOTL Forever
[6:06:56] Smokebear: WoD had the benefit of garrisons giving your characters 100k+ gold a week without doing anything
[6:06:57] emznev: Wod was better than shadowlands no cap
[6:06:57] Alaquane: yeah, but did you forget vashjir?
[6:06:57] Nokterian: WoD was awful
[6:06:58] EclipserEU: cata had Xmog + LFR
[6:07:01] Alaquane: woof
[6:07:02] Nevindaz: Bastion of Twilight and Blackwing Temple?
[6:07:05] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: @Sheerphenom different people enjoy different things in games dud
[6:07:06] aistahh: WoD was the time I foud your stream, Towelliee, remember when I played wod I had your stream on the second monitor good times
[6:07:06] mikejames01: wod endgame was ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
[6:07:07] Se7enS0ul: BFA was most fleshed out than most expacs, just didnt make me want to play if i take a break
[6:07:08] Molvonos: Got to see Ragnaros skipping leg day since Vanilla.
[6:07:09] Nokterian: LUL
[6:07:10] smashwow: cata had firelands and some of the best pvp i can remember
[6:07:10] KillaPr0: I just got harvester set, never had a set in new world
[6:07:11] Sarkerius: in 10.0 we trust
[6:07:13] Zenfar_: WoD had no content but what it did have was good, everything after wod made you wanna quit because of systems and BS.
[6:07:18] Tia214: there a boa maps of all the FPs now :D
[6:07:18] Crypticedge: LUL
[6:07:21] Plague_GG: other than the Deathwing letdown, Cata was fire
[6:07:21] gidgeet: lol
[6:07:24] Thv_: @siglius  okay so I’m assuming it’s safe to say it’ll be up when I get home from work in 3 hours
[6:07:25] Yoitsnova: there was nothing to do in wod
[6:07:26] mikejames01: WOd story was damn good but endgame was YUCK
[6:07:27] Maroleb: great raids with facebook content in between
[6:07:28] Kelticlore: im a regular person and i didnt leave the game
[6:07:30] nerdtopia: WoD had good pvp
[6:07:32] xViewersunitedx: hot take garrisons were the best 0art of draenor coxSteven
[6:07:33] Nokterian: WoD last patch was a raid and twitter intergration! LUL
[6:07:36] GoKu1g: ye, WoD had the biggest content draught like, EVER
[6:07:42] xViewersunitedx: part•
[6:07:46] fiingerz: but it made us all rich
[6:07:50] Xerevil: @xViewersunitedx it's true tho lol
[6:08:01] Sheerphenom: more people have quit the game and guilds died in SL than WoD.
[6:08:08] Buttscratchrr: not a fan of cata myself
[6:08:22] Zenfar_: cata had 9 mil subs still when it was finished, bit much to say its one of the worst
[6:08:26] luckfore: end of WoD was fun when you deleted all ur garrison buildings LUL
[6:08:33] nerdtopia: 7
[6:08:34] brimes: for me cata was the worst
[6:08:37] xViewersunitedx: trikSuperFine
[6:08:46] gidgeet: Cata was ok lol WOD was just awful. So yeah bottom three would be Cata, Shadow, WOD
[6:08:46] Alaquane: Did blizzard sleep in?
[6:09:04] falldrgn: New jailer model looks cool
[6:09:06] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: they did an unexpected walkout
[6:09:13] Oakengrove: WotLK>MoP>TBC>Cata>Legion>WoD>SL>BFA
[6:09:14] Thv_: Well SL also has the blizzard investigation so it’s hard to compare them
[6:09:16] smashwow: blizz looked at 9.2 and said nope. Kappa
[6:09:18] xViewersunitedx: MOP had what amount of subs at the end?
[6:09:18] cazhually: im so angry with blizz like so angry
[6:09:19] Crypticedge: dw
[6:09:20] temp3st98: 2014 felt like a year ago
[6:09:20] aistahh: Man I miss your old purple Hammers up T shirt with the dragon on it, man that was such a good T shirt.
[6:09:35] Aquadriel: theres lke 50 people in mmo champ that have that graph as their forum signature LMAO
[6:09:36] Xerevil: i love WoD for all the gold it made me lol

[6:10:33] Aquadriel: i was hyped PepeHands
[6:10:37] Nokterian: I remember that
[6:10:39] cineris_3: the movie was coming out too right?
[6:10:40] Nokterian: LUL
[6:10:42] teeeyy: imagine mop with m+^^
[6:10:47] flebbooo: So much hype!
[6:10:50] xViewersunitedx: hahahaha
[6:10:52] Smokebear: WoD was the movie expansion to let us play along all our favorite characters in the movie :)
[6:10:52] Crypticedge: FACTS
[6:10:56] MosesBun: wasnt the best but to me probably better then sl
[6:10:56] Korupcija_: selfie patch Kreygasm

[6:11:12] grrodesu: draenor prob had the most potential behind wotlk
[6:11:12] magecrimes: WoD was only good for the players who just Log in and and Raid

[6:11:24] Korupcija_: could be 20M all we know!
[6:11:25] cazhually: they got scared
[6:11:28] smashwow: @thv_ nah the investigations gave people an easy out to quit the awful game play. if the content was legion level of good people would have easily of left. people underestimate the keeping value of a good product. there is a threshold for moral impact but it's lower than people think.
[6:11:30] Smokebear: WoD was only good to farm millions of gold from your garrison followers
[6:11:30] cazhually: they got scared releasing that
[6:11:31] xwoulfx: Do we know SL numbers?
[6:11:31] xViewersunitedx: legion was dope af
[6:11:32] Thv_: You could argue MoP was the best class design expansion
[6:11:45] Sheerphenom: You can "guess" all day to numbers from legion to now, but you can look at people and activity in the game and finding groups and guilds dying and do a comparison.... its clear that BFA and SL are shit and more players haveq uit
[6:11:47] smashwow: wouldn't have*
[6:11:48] nerdtopia: there's more to it than just sub count tho, you have to take into account the reason why people stopped playing, may not necessarily be because the game was bad
[6:11:51] Hesh3: garrisons were depressing
[6:11:55] RealSolaroid: WoWhead releasing more datamined stuff!!!! PTR CANT BE LONG!
[6:11:57] Aidler: my top is MoP... but that's my nostalgia I guess
[6:11:58] idenkaz_: ngl MoP had the best class design i would agree with that 100%
[6:12:14] Hesh3: classes were best in mop imo
[6:12:19] cineris_3: more people quit vanilla than any other though technically
[6:12:19] Kelticlore: Shadowands and BFA IMO  are the worst
[6:12:25] bukka_hot: wod had Ashran
[6:12:25] Korupcija_: just give patches every 3 months and game will be fine
[6:12:25] Smokebear: MoP class design was best bring back OG Monk
[6:12:27] smashwow: @magemyway everyone sites MoP and Cata for design on a lot of classes
[6:12:32] chambiann: @Hesh3 some specs, i can agree with that
[6:12:34] Crypticedge: Wrath will always be my favorite just my opinion
[6:12:35] cazhually: shadowlands is grining to the max
[6:12:36] kiruz__: so is 10.0 falls into making something different?
[6:12:40] Zenfar_: only one things for sure, SL is by far the worst with BFA coming in 2nd
[6:12:43] AVO_joe: yeah the fillers they made after wod is absolute dog water
[6:12:48] cazhually: slands has 6 systems

[6:13:11] Smokebear: *logs in at 4am* WoW is dead

[6:13:39] DuploThief: @MosesBun not really
[6:13:39] Kisswani: LUL
[6:13:45] PaToMike: if you base it off Silvermoon the game has been dead since Lich king lol
[6:13:47] hauz47: @Towelliee wait wait wait, your argument is that wow is even slightly alive atm?
[6:13:48] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: AANY MINUTE NOW HOPIUM
[6:13:50] RageerPLZ: I mean it's "HIS/HER" metric so we cannot say what HE/SHE judges it by, if they think the game is dead and don't like it that's there own opinion.
[6:13:52] Thv_: Go watch the “Was WOD that bad?” By Hirumaredx and tell me WOD didn’t have much to do
[6:13:56] Sheerphenom: I can find a million groups..... Look at wowprogress.  Go to the top servers and look at how many guilds have died.  I was on the FULL servers....  and raided in many guilds and raided at a CE level.  are you serious?
[6:13:56] Secondbreakfasttt: @magemyway can confirm
[6:13:57] Snomase: FF14 is more popular but yet WoW has more views on twitch and Youtube. btw I cant wait to play the expan tonight!

[6:14:51] Layliah79: Haters going to hate. No other MMO will ever outdo WOW no matter what ppl say!
[6:14:51] Jokervenom1978: Its not dead but its definitely suffering.
[6:14:52] crazygizmos: thats horrible lol
[6:14:52] itsKingManny: people have been waiting for WoW to die so theyre gonna take any scandal as the final knife in the game...

[6:14:58] Thoreya: so true
[6:14:59] Nin_Fang: TRUE
[6:15:01] Crypticedge: i play the game, its my escape, idgaf what they do
[6:15:02] crixr6: people say every game is dead if they don't like it. That's their logic.
[6:15:02] SethRonin: cause to quote K from MIB.... People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it.
[6:15:03] luckfore: just look at raider io it will tell you exactly how alive it is
[6:15:04] runotentertaine: So its not just New World or SWTOR that has "This game is dead" trolls
[6:15:05] Secondbreakfasttt: @12months bro ahahahahh

[6:15:08] Calcium2662: Fuck WoW
[6:15:13] mavericks312: in the last 6 months wow has had some of its best sales while contrevsory is going on

[6:31:04] Sulfatank: R2WF is a epeen blow job nothing else
[6:31:04] PandeyWOW: Blizzard destroys everything true
[6:31:06] N3llee: NO BLIZZ
[6:31:08] brodycanuck: race to world first is for bragging rights, not for making money
[6:31:09] N3llee: in WFR
[6:31:12] Aidler: and it will only be on YT
[6:31:14] Korupcija_: basically he quit since too much work for no money

[6:31:51] cineris_3: got  challenged, couldnt handle it
[6:31:53] Alegnowar: Blizz infuence in world first race sounds scary, but maybe needed in the future
[6:31:57] Nokterian: SMOrc

[6:32:13] Zivs: just backseating
[6:32:21] Secondbreakfasttt: @cineris_3 that's what i thought when i first saw this
[6:32:42] brodycanuck: Thats not exactly blizzards fault, sounds like something the top guilds created themselves by constantly upping the competition
[6:32:43] hikaritd: doing 1 WFR / year is too much BabyRage
[6:32:46] yshtola1337: i hope they have a good healer to fill his place
[6:32:49] Secondbreakfasttt: i won, not wanna lose again lol
[6:32:53] Roxino120: being the best is cool and all but people need income to make a living

[6:33:47] jasperboy: Chrispotter
[6:33:49] Gingerprimer: Healing officer in Echo
[6:33:50] Rottencoarse: Echo's main healer officer
[6:33:52] brodycanuck: @momofantv most WoW players dont even care
[6:33:54] joe_g_433: They will find someone else to fill his spot. Teams change up all the time.
[6:33:57] KingofMeccano: @Towelliee have you seen the dungeon journal for 9.2 on wowhead? 24mins ago
[6:33:59] N3llee: @momofantv yea you right... it only broke viewer records on twitch.
[6:34:03] Aidler: income should not have been a problem with all the sponsors they have....
[6:34:05] Naturalbeef: WF Raider to truck driver
[6:34:32] momofantv: @N3llee except it didnt bc its never even been near a esport in views or XQC in views
[6:34:33] Aquadriel: Aidler gotta keep in mind that is split between more than 20 people
[6:34:36] Thoreya: true
[6:34:37] Roxino120: @Aidler it is when its split between 30-40 people
[6:34:54] smashwow: @Naturalbeef truck drivers make good money. i know truckers that make 6 figures.
[6:34:59] N3llee: @momofantv go get informed... read some facts. viewer records were broken for twitch
[6:35:00] Roxino120: unless you're a streaming. you're not getting much
[6:35:05] Zivs: @KingofMeccano he saw atleast some of it last night, not sure about all tho
[6:35:20] Rober: That is why Limit max said he splits his streaming income to the guild I think
[6:35:21] dutchie76: Limit lose anyone?
[6:35:32] brodycanuck: gotta be entertaining to make it in entertainment...its not just about skill
[6:35:36] Thoreya: potter goes way back to. like method WoD days
[6:35:36] dazla78: Its about 18k a year
[6:35:38] momofantv: @N3llee you are wrong it never touched league or dota or cs go's millions of views
[6:35:39] Aidler: hmm could be but I was under the impression limit and echo have enough money to pay all their people well
[6:35:45] Aquadriel: just get more viewers 4Head
[6:35:50] N3llee: @momofantv google bro.. its your friend.
[6:36:03] Nevindaz: just play FF Kappa
[6:36:08] ThatsProto: Max said he profit shares
[6:36:08] Korupcija_: limit people get paid in wow tokens
[6:36:13] momofantv: @N3llee youre a retard you dont have anything saying it did lol
[6:36:16] Thasin22: during the race he splits his earnings from twitch
[6:36:24] ThatsProto: He said he splits all rev from twitch during race
[6:36:33] Rober: I am pumped for this patch not gonna lie
[6:36:40] nathrizen: did he explain the split percentages?
[6:36:43] N3llee: @momofantv cant post links here my man. but simple google search will get you educated.
[6:36:57] Naturalbeef: @smashwow Sounds like a strange transition. Always expect these types to be involved in IT or gaming
[6:37:05] crixr6: are you streaming all day today Towelliee?
[6:37:08] momofantv: @N3llee it broke hours watched who cares
[6:37:09] Raaeni: aster?
[6:37:09] Kisswani: GG has the best wow twitter account as well LUL
[6:37:18] Roxino120: A player in limit/echo will make 3k-5k max if you're a raider per tier. you cant make a living off that
[6:37:20] momofantv: @N3llee not viewers
[6:37:26] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  method (or the new Echo)
[6:38:10] N3llee: @momofantv grats on google searching.. keep going.
[6:38:15] Alegnowar: whit the race being consumed in such a short amount of time it's hard fore more orgs to step in and making it work
[6:38:22] Kisswani: also , lets be real , not all raiders have the personality to be a successful streamer
[6:38:41] Kisswani: KEKW
[6:38:42] N3llee: had to block that person getting annoying cause they dont want to read.
[6:38:45] momofantv: @N3llee it hasnt broken a viewer record ever only most watched
[6:38:46] smashwow: @Naturalbeef depends on what they did before gaming. a lot of times, people getting into music, acting, etc need flexible schedules and decent money. service industry does well with that.
[6:38:49] Gingerprimer: Yeah and not like any of the big orgs in esports actuall are making a profit
[6:38:51] doomester: @Towelliee isnt endwalker on the 7th of december?
[6:38:53] bypized: They are waiting for the Endwalker
[6:38:53] brodycanuck: Riots mmo will be hard too since MMOs have established MMO streamers, plus LoL and valorant streamers that will be playing it
[6:38:53] Korupcija_: I can't believe it's not up yet LMAO
[6:38:54] RealSolaroid: Summon PTR!
[6:38:54] momofantv: fucking retard lol
[6:38:55] Astrolarx: True..Mavycakes has a face for radio
[6:38:56] haugexxx: did ptr not go live yesterday?
[6:38:57] nathrizen: i have a feeling PTR wont be live until 13 hours from now
[6:39:02] ZakuzaGB: streaming wow as a new streamer is really daunting
[6:39:05] Infinitepeeep: @Towelliee ill check back at 5:45 when you go offline
[6:39:08] fiingerz: all the new streamers these days are m+ key carriers
[6:39:14] theDirtyon3: Blizz is stalling longer than Rich right now with this PTR LULW
[6:39:15] smashwow: streaming could be looked at similarly especially when you're young and need 2wks off for a competition
[6:39:15] nocturnal_2195: @n3llee the first 4 letters of his name fit him well if you know what I mean
[6:39:18] Secondbreakfasttt: and tomorrow raid test, yet we didn't get in the ptr
[6:39:27] N3llee: @insanity2195 truuuuue
[6:39:28] oxidexd: @Aidler it's probably not as high as you think
[6:39:33] BubbaChubbs420: I kinda wish they didn't have BETA but Blizz has not proven to release flushed out content.
[6:39:34] jasperboy: He has friends and connections. If Potter wanted to go even part time streamer, all he has to do is ask for shout outs, retweets and help from his friends and guildies.

[6:41:04] Kisswani: Method , guardians of WF integrity Kappa
[6:41:06] oxidexd: fragnance commented on it a few days ago about what people have to do outside of just having sponsors

[6:55:39] Moobot: The Early Access for Endwalker is set to begin on Friday, December 3 at 1:00 a.m. (PST) / 4:00 a.m. (EST)!
[6:55:41] sl1nky1981: Definitely not a coincidence that raid testing starts tomorrow
[6:55:43] MarzWandrer: Pretty sure it wouldn't be the first time they did that, lol.
[6:55:46] Kelticlore: Blizzard needs to keep there players in there games some how
[6:55:48] L4dy_Renegade: Would anyone -really- be surprised? LUL
[6:56:10] Wcvechten: raid testing will be just a queu game
[6:56:14] zackmcquack: do yo think blizzard is concerned? i mean do they really think there core players are going anywhere?
[6:56:19] K_Rok: Do you have to use eye drops to keep your eyes from drying out during long stream sessions?
[6:56:19] AttxTwitch: Blizzard : "We decided to change the upcoming raid name to Sepulcher of the Endwalker"
[6:56:26] N3llee: max isnt streaming ptr
[6:56:30] AureliusXV: limit isnt streaming it
[6:56:31] bypized: But maybe more important than actual players, at this point Blizzard would do anything for good attention
[6:56:31] griffdog125: the workers in Oribos all quit.  wows putting in self check outs
[6:56:34] W0lfinn: I think around 40 hours so far
[6:56:36] The_Mail_Man__: its been 43 hours
[6:56:37] Krunklock: and only a fraction of them play FFXIV and they don't usually stream their raid testing
[6:56:41] flebbooo: 40+ hours KEKW
[6:56:51] Slinttu: yea
[6:56:52] AureliusXV: yes theyre going hard this tier
[6:56:54] BrunoArmond: do top guilds streams ptr test?
[6:56:57] Krunklock: they 100% will do the PTR testing
[6:56:57] AureliusXV: ""
[6:56:58] Korupcija_: they never stream PTR
[6:57:01] sl1nky1981: Max said they are focusing harder on this super hard
[6:57:01] Thasin22: said they are taking it real serious this go around
[6:57:07] N3llee: they will be ptriing it no stream
[6:57:22] The_Mail_Man__: yea they were super lax
[6:57:27] The_Mail_Man__: def need to step it up
[6:57:28] Slinttu: @Korupcija_ They did in 9.1, but now they are not doing any PTR streaming, not even heroic
[6:57:29] ZakuzaGB: holy crap i finally got mecha done finished just now
[6:57:47] AureliusXV: $$$$$$
[6:57:54] Thasin22: yea going back to back had them on cloud 9 and got brought down this past tier
[6:57:55] TheUnknowing: Yeah, I think even max would say they were pretty sloppy last tier
[6:57:56] Korupcija_: @Slinttu ah true, I think echo was the one who didn't stream
[6:58:10] ChrisarN: MONEY > PROGRESSION

[6:59:12] jonesth: winning = the same
[6:59:17] DaniBoo_18: the last 3 bosses not being released is going to be interesting
[6:59:21] Suplazin: both guilds are hungrier than ever because both have experienced defeat now

[6:59:55] jonesth: gonna be the best WFR in some time i bet, im stoked
[7:00:17] N3llee: @jonesth think so to if they decide not to test or preview the last 3 bosses in anyway
[7:00:18] Thasin22: Not testing but they are releasing separate
[7:00:24] Zayocast_v2: When do you think we will get any news about 10.0 ?
[7:00:29] DallTV_: the race was amasing this tier
[7:00:30] Dudamnit: Pieces was 3rd right?
[7:00:32] luckfore: Method goal was top 5 in 9.1 but they are going for #1 in 9.2
[7:00:38] TheUnknowing: I think BDGG can get pretty close over the next few tiers, but its going to take them awhile.
[7:00:42] Thoreya: method got andybrew and wildi

[7:05:11] Sulfatank: nope
[7:05:28] Hoodicon: r u gonna raid in swtor
[7:05:29] ZakuzaGB: they only thing that put me off was like the amount of systems and craftin not my thing
[7:05:29] Warjun11: yeah why not creating this Tournament realm where everybody can start the same
[7:05:32] o__mj__o: @dudutzu89 give and blizzard dont combine

[7:09:09] Kelticlore: No one controled Sylvannas it was all her
[7:09:10] Kisswani: it seems more about arthas
[7:09:23] Aidler: they always say that
[7:09:35] Epiclurker27893: I thought sylvanas' dialogue was about Arthas controlling her to attack silvermoon
[7:09:43] smashwow: feedback? PTR already out?
[7:09:44] L4dy_Renegade: Sylvanas like " I'm sorry.. i'm really, really sorry.. " Like in that one South Park episode rofl
