[1:07:15] Koraszdormu: Hot take- I think conquest should be account-wide, so you can grind it from quests on all alts, but choose who to use it on.  Letting you gradually gear everyone without the gatcha boxes gamble.
[1:07:36] flameohotmann: @sleightxyz ty haha

[3:29:03] FateIRL: yes
[3:29:07] telen46: got it semi recently on survival
[3:29:10] GodzChild220: there are 2 versions of that weapon from that boss

[3:33:36] irrationalkiwi: is rsham hard to learn? trying to pick a healer to learn for solo shuffle
[3:34:14] McLarge: I'm very hydrated. My gf got me a 1 gallon water bottle for Valentine's a couple years ago that I keep at my desk
[3:34:31] supatease: im getting old or is it normal for ketchup to give you a headache
[3:34:35] Bonegraft: still working on that first gallon

[3:35:36] pheezr_: 5:30am for me, good song to wake up to
[3:35:49] McLarge: You have a very wide range when it comes to your taste in music
[3:35:50] Moobot: Latest video "We Just Got A First Look At The Mage Hero Talents Coming In 11.0" view it here: youtu.be/-q4ekr2IRjA
[3:36:46] supatease: Phrygian dominant scale sounds cool
[3:37:07] McLarge: @supatease Did you just put a curse on me??
[3:37:15] McLarge: What is that word
[3:37:24] supatease: nah its the 5th mode of the harmonic minor scale which this song is the key of
[3:37:49] McLarge: Yeah I got no idea what you just said
[3:38:04] StromicusRex: me when music talk plonK
[3:38:06] supatease: is this still the same song
[3:38:15] supatease: quite a mood change from the intro
[3:38:41] supatease: im a music theory nerd
[3:38:52] StromicusRex: i like ven after dark cuz ven always has the music louder and i can actually hear it
[3:39:34] StromicusRex: no that's not what i'm saying
[3:39:50] StromicusRex: Madge
[3:40:02] exizt_01: that songs a vibe

[3:40:26] alrajhio: average wait time: we'll let you know
[3:41:03] ObbTheKnob: ive seen them live!
[3:41:12] McLarge: Rmpvictim would be an insane name for a DH
[3:41:58] Somanie: is that like a steel pan ? in the song?
[3:42:50] StromicusRex: ven do you know/enjoy the bands Sleep Token, or Motionless in White?
[3:46:40] FateIRL: its because nobody targets them, worst kill target
[3:46:44] StromicusRex: i'm gonna see them live in may, i'm so excited
[3:46:57] McLarge: Hardest to kill sounds incorrect. Only because Sub/Outlaw exists, ofc
[3:47:02] FateIRL: dh is as broken as the ret rework lol
[3:47:39] McLarge: That's interesting
[3:48:11] FateIRL: its funny leather classes are tankier than mail/plate
[3:48:27] foxyllama: 104 raiders from foxyllama have joined! 
[3:48:32] foxyllama: ggs bro
[3:48:36] McLarge: Not entirely surprising, people don't bother targeting it usually. I wonder if that has everything to do with its defensive kit or if the choice in partner? Most DH comps generally have a squishy DPS partner
[3:48:41] finnybae: /wave
[3:48:46] dark_spearr: hello from foxys stream

[3:51:55] McLarge: I feel like a lot of people are sleeping on Sub/Fire/HPriest rn. I find it hard to believe that comp couldn't do well at the top of the ladder. Thoughts?
[3:52:00] Vigi9413: do solo rbgs interest you ven?
[3:52:13] R1_Prototype: nice. I actually just tried MM and really like it after years of BM.

[3:54:07] setuppx1: miestro's deliverance ready in 30 sec
[3:54:29] McLarge: My thought is that RMP allows Fire Mage to adopt a very lockdown heavy playstyle where you don't really allow players to move. If you think back to Shadowlands, Fire Mage was terrible in any comp outside of Sub/Fire/HPriest or HPala because it was so fragile, but RMP was the best comp in the game

[3:55:38] arcane_p: give me back season 1 shadowlands fire mage with triune ward 45 second combustion and blink with blazing barrier
[3:55:54] cajovysacok: thats so cruel
[3:55:56] zemm8582: zemm8582 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 67 months! 
[3:56:02] GalachadQT: @McLarge fire mage was also good in wmx and ww/mage
[3:56:09] zemm8582: win it for me!
[3:56:14] zemm8582: for no reason but subs
[3:58:08] McLarge: @GalachadQT Not towards the end. By Season 3, they had nerfed Blazing Barrier so heavily that it was really easy to blow up a Fire Mage as soon as you connected, and it relied on Rogue pretty heavily to peel. We saw this evidenced by the first Solo Shuffle invitational held by Blizzard where Fire basically lost every round without a Rogue
