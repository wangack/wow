[1:46:09] slumcreek: Rated battlegrounds
[1:46:16] clystia: kinda hard items so powerful
[1:46:18] SilkeySmooth: more honor from bgs equals less grinding time
[1:46:20] Facer339: the hours spent progressing all depends on what people on the server are doign though
[1:46:23] bravo2017: what is name addons show you how much ur rank %
[1:46:25] YewieUE: i dont, i think it takes away from the gear being awesome
[1:46:26] lightweaver: they did that in tbc. it's called arenas
[1:46:31] bathroombuddy11: yeah i have a full time job and just hti rank 10 unsure what the grind looks like from here lol
[1:46:32] helpy6666: so setting a cap limit that you have to hit per day
[1:46:39] Facer339: if *everyone* only spend 8-10 hours a day pvp gridning, then it would be *much* easiere
[1:46:56] PinksaG: its way too much
[1:47:01] h4yden: best gear till naxx though?>
[1:47:15] Shadwassasin: the problem is the person with the most time sets the standard
[1:47:16] aviduser2: yeah when they designed the system they didnt see this coming
[1:47:20] ironforge_1337: if you're a NEET then 17+ hours a day is fine
[1:47:22] Facer339: but there's a ton of people that choose to do it 16-17 hours a day
[1:47:27] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:47:35] helpy6666: just need to set a limit per day you have to hit and as ranks go up the limit goes up
[1:47:38] SirBeardsAl0t: is ther a difference in honor gains between healer/dmg/tank? also sirbea11HEY  @Swifty
[1:47:39] aviduser2: i think just grinding a set amount of honor would be better
[1:47:40] Facer339: so it's not the games fault the grind is so grindy, it's the people playing
[1:47:42] Shintek: depends on classes, a lot of classes are better with AQ40 gear
[1:47:43] 1socket_eth_thresher: have leagues you sign up for each week where you can only play with others who sign up in those leagues and during a specific 8 hour window of the day.
[1:47:43] aviduser2: without decay
[1:47:45] h4yden: for a hunter, you dont replace rank 13 gear till naxx full tier
[1:47:46] ttvKHAN36: i wish they made disarm remove weapon spellpower
[1:47:47] Jigslol_: Are you ready for 2 legendaries in 9.2 Retail ?
[1:47:50] aviduser2: maybe 100 mill honor or whatever
[1:47:50] Melllkorr: wait rank 14 gear is better than AQ gear?
[1:47:59] ironforge_1337: i am so glad i was in college when WoW came out.... i got to play 24/7 for years and neglect all my classes lol
[1:47:59] TheseDaysLIVE: You skipped 4 seasons worth of farming in 1
[1:48:05] CrazyKanax: what if everyone is 100 %
[1:48:06] CrazyKanax: ?

[1:48:31] spanckdat: grats swiffy! so glad u finally got r14
[1:48:41] YewieUE: idk. if everyone has it, it kinda makes it less appealing.
[1:48:48] BoricuaSJ: lets see.. I work 8 to 10 hrs of work, 2 hrs of bath/food/ time, then 8 hrs of sleep, that leave what 4 hours top?
[1:48:48] spanckdat: must be such a relief. ur girlfriend must be stoked!
[1:48:52] Saamul: like play 700 AVs
[1:48:57] aviduser2: @Melllkorr aq/r14 pretty simular itemlvl
[1:49:04] bathroombuddy11: what was pool size on your server? @Swifty
[1:49:14] discordvanitas: i crated 1000+ herbs today and im proud of myself
[1:49:21] discordvanitas: bcs now i can make a lot of money
[1:49:27] YewieUE: having it gives the whole "god among mortals" appeal.
[1:49:45] discordvanitas: gathered*
[1:49:50] Laress: hi swifty, hope u have good day!
[1:49:51] YewieUE: but if its easy to get
[1:49:57] YewieUE: it takes away that appeal
[1:50:06] Shintek: r14 gear is bis till naxx for pvp but a lot of pieces get replaced in pve during aq40
[1:50:09] turn2spikejester: 140 hours and thats best case scenario
[1:50:19] mrsjcosplay: Hey Swifty! :)
[1:50:22] rickErikE: Gratz again Swifty! there is only one more thing to do..... HAND OF RAG! :D
[1:50:35] toemaytoez: hey that's only 20 hours a day
[1:50:38] probablyjewish: if you're too burned out to play once you get 14 then what's the point
[1:50:43] spanckdat: 8k honour per hour takes 175 hours
[1:50:48] Chayan116: gratz on r14 Swifty!

[1:51:09] sannare: Yeah thats a lot of hours which most people do no have
[1:51:12] truckerdaveuk: they need to make days 48 hours long to fit everything in
[1:51:14] ttvKHAN36: @spanckdat which you need to do 25hours a day lol
[1:51:21] tycenstiff: Hey congrats!

[1:52:03] clystia: so ppl can take break from ranking

[1:54:36] YewieUE: oh the system is absolute trash 100% but im saying the whole "run from that guy, hes rank16. rank 14, rank 13." it takes away that side of it b/c if it gets easier to achieve. the main appeal of having the gear is i no lifed for this gear to be insane
[1:54:55] turn2spikejester: NOOO   please no AV! AB! AB ! AB!
[1:54:57] vonomoon: i feel like if r14 was easier, guilds would require everyone to rank.  just like flask are easier to come by in SOM and now considered "required".  In Classic WoW, flask were more optional if you had the gold.
