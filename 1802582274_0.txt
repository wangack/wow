[0:22:00] Zscuppa: Hey Swifty, greetings from the Czech Republic zanyth1LOVE
[0:22:02] Dusty_mt: Its the reason people take cruelty first, because you get sweeping at 35 and then WW at 36

[0:23:39] Dusty_mt: Well generally crit is really good, especially with axe spec and being an orc - so understandable not to do that as human
[0:23:58] ogRixis: Damn what happened to Swiftys cool background
[0:24:15] FoolsForest: Those death sounds in the background swiftyFacepalm

[0:25:47] Kaetheras: Mouseover attack in the spellbook
[0:25:48] Dusty_mt: Impale is crit damage, so without cruelty crit and axe spec crit it drops off for leveling - also due to it needing points in the rend talent which is pretty useless
[0:26:03] WinOver: deep wounds can be risky also as it can break your fear stopping you from getting the bandage off
[0:27:32] Lickmygun: why don't u just go revenge build?
[0:27:46] RominoTV: Revenge isnt that good in classic

[6:52:04] BoricuaSJ: Space is Hard, Space is Dangerous, it will be a long time till we can live in space or until some major tech advancement
[6:52:06] esotericempiretv: im sure sure what the interest is in a barren wasteland when we have a perfectly good planet we're destroying right here. We've got everything we need but we're too focussed on wanting somwhere unlivable
[6:52:16] kozar817: Right
[6:52:17] Venom77: so you have to wear spacesuit 90% of time unless you in capsule

[6:52:42] FoolsForest: Terraform
[6:52:43] TkD_LezGo: something i keep up with actually. YOu will have to live underground short of making a Huge dome or something. There are so many city size cave on mars that you dont need a dome
[6:52:51] CygnusC: better fix our own stuff before we mess up another planet
[6:53:02] xAce101x: nuke mars
[6:53:05] ambassador12: true
[6:53:06] AlchYourself: would take thousands of years to terraform mars though
[6:53:09] AlchYourself: at least
[6:53:10] esotericempiretv: i don't mind the idea of exploration, but right now mars pales in comparison to earth
[6:53:11] time_ina_bottle: NUKE IT
[6:53:14] xAce101x: fast way to teraform it
[6:53:17] stormwindchill: nuke earth

[6:53:43] kozar817: Stay outside
[6:53:59] TkD_LezGo: we dont have that tech tho and even if we did, the fact that mars has no magnedic field, everything you do will be eroded due the radiation.
[6:54:12] AlchYourself: centrifuge
[6:54:16] therealjonvh: The gravitron
[6:54:30] ambassador12: carousel?
[6:54:38] AnniMattR: we need to develop Slipspace technology so we can just take a few minutes to get to mars Kappa

[6:57:00] TkD_LezGo: problem with cenrifuge how ever is the fact that you are spinning and if you were to throw a ball straight across. by the time the balls get the other side, it is hitting you in the face cause you spun around into the direction you threw it haha.
[6:57:07] Venom77: yes

[6:57:47] Drascho27: @bombaemaybe his monitor is really big.
[6:58:24] therealjonvh: @Chromatic On a normal day, the Earth rotates at roughly 1,000 miles per hour
[6:58:31] TkD_LezGo: we are in the center of the mass. if we were on the outer ring, throwing striaght across wouldnt be a thing
[6:58:34] Chromatic: You compensating with that monitor swifty? LUL
[6:58:45] TyrVexX: ore is needed for a quest but dont know which

[6:59:44] LoKoGaR123: that's why your pixels look so DANG CRISP
[6:59:53] Lexon7: playing moba wold be sick. can see more terrain
[7:00:01] KhaosDryad: whats the sword you got?
[7:00:02] RampageReezy: would u buy a 4090?
[7:00:03] TkD_LezGo: and im just using as a ref. you wouldnt be spinning fast enough for that to happen(ball hitting you in the face). But yeah when you are on the outer edge and you try to throw to the otherside of the outer edge, thats not going to work.

[8:27:09] Lolajugs: Def turn off bro
[8:27:11] Arkend_: OLED suffers from burn-in... so if you have a static image on your screen for a long time it can create a shadow of that image over everything, hence burning it into the screen.  SOme OLEDs have an auto screensaver to prevent this

[8:28:06] Chromatic: There is a screen saver on that monitor
[8:28:06] Arkend_: its mostly if you leave it on with just your desktop or something over time.  Playing a game like this you will be fine
