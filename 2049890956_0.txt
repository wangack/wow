[1:58:11] Madnox: @NurfMe206 its dumb. blizzard cant balance the game so they need to put in hardcore dampening instead
[1:58:35] vbx93: i like it simple. in wotlk there are white hits and styles, you understand where dmg comes from. Retail theres just a million numbers and you got no clue whats going on
[1:59:14] NurfMe206: @Madnox yeah ez bandage for bad balance, but sometimes when healer gets so good (like 2s this ssn), dampening would be nice
[1:59:55] Madnox: @NurfMe206 or they could actually just balance it with small updates. but they dont care at all for their games

[2:47:59] remmixx: @NurfMe206  that's ok too, but I want to know what works versus which comps so I can gear towards the comps we have issues with
[2:48:18] Madnox: depends on insurance and since its an old car he probably doesnt have that included (im assuming he has the lowest tier of insurance)
