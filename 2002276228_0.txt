[0:18:21] RollenderSpeckneck: @clev_vr whether to wait or not is not strategic at all. the only thing u can do in this game is block sites off thats all there is to it. it aint nearly as deep as you tryna put it. theres 0 weapon variety, the maps are random af too. it has potential but is not living up to it at this point in time, lets see where it gets

[0:38:32] choft2: isn't that still coordination?
[0:38:33] benny_kong: The amount of M players with healing and defib equipped but not using either is crazy

[0:39:05] arman__101: Normal ppl? LUL
[0:39:06] sirbllake: better pinging system similar to apex
[0:39:07] tomatohz: light needs to be nerfed
[0:39:07] Zebidiah27: the fps god cannot comprehend the struggles of us mortals
[0:39:08] stainednapkins: @shroud do you think more game modes with bigger teams would be fun?
[0:39:09] rukia__kuchiki: drugs are bad mmk @joewelch29
[0:39:09] SinAppsAblaze: audio cues
[0:39:10] SparkYYY_123: Also they should add teamchat atleast
[0:39:12] crispy_zebra: This game is already loud AF, i dont need more lol
[0:39:12] ziongames_: they havve that
[0:39:13] Roelyyyn: Angela, i need healing
[0:39:15] Whitecheddahttv: a comms wheel ??
[0:39:15] Sweatymology: U can
[0:39:17] Med13val: the "normal" people need something alerting and basically forcing them to pay attention to objectives lol
[0:39:17] Tom_Kanazaki: real
[0:39:17] P4ul_3_: @shroud press mousewheel
[0:39:18] DoctorLiquid: they have that
[0:39:18] SpaceisLife: Like I said Im a bot but if Im better than the average thats just sad
[0:39:19] ken_3116: i need healing
[0:39:19] kittynyahn: @Zebidiah27 we are peasants compared to our king :P
[0:39:20] lecam82: you can with middle mouse click
[0:39:20] itmeplastic: they already have that
[0:39:21] SK1NFATHER: thats in the game already
[0:39:22] DaProphet33: hey shroodle, can you design a low-iq mode for people like me ?
[0:39:25] raydn: mousewheel

[0:39:29] P4ul_3_: @shroud press and hold mousewheel
[0:39:30] Menmaro: I love how he just talking casually while aimbotting lmao
[0:39:30] MartianMagic: There is a comms wheel
[0:39:31] tyronebiggms: OW has a ton of audio cues, even just automatic ones
[0:39:31] kittynyahn: @VIIIVIIIXCI ohh ty for the lore :3
[0:39:35] DaFlea420: what team game doesnt have team chat..?
[0:39:36] masakari333: Need stuff for normal people like chatgpt assistant telling them what to do
[0:39:38] Krubbless: @karlmon me
[0:39:40] MartianMagic: I think it‚Äôs B by default
[0:39:42] itmeplastic: how not to read chat lmfao
[0:39:42] oliverqueenll: low iq mode
[0:39:43] robonator75: The game has a tough learning curve at first but once it clicks oh man
[0:39:43] disflux: If solo ranked Overwatch has taught me anything, people don't play their class and voice lines like "I need healing" are ignored. It's just a people problem.
[0:39:44] TheLooseGooose: More casual fun modes so they can get used to it slowly
[0:39:49] st1x_val: Yo shroudy, how is building your own game going? Any updates?

[0:39:51] gs_arcane: @onemanpush that‚Äôs personal preference. OW is much too slow for my taste for example, doesn‚Äôt mean we should treat it as a fact and call the finals better
[0:39:58] wxllrr: like see

[0:40:27] pvp_soul: bots are playing without healing beam
[0:40:27] joewelch29: @shroud recon this game could be an esport .
[0:40:28] Yoink7: "i need healing" :D

[0:40:42] MythologyKing: robots would heal you there
[0:40:42] Perfectclear: honestly, the best thing would be auto-join voice chat default
[0:40:42] pvp_soul: @xblaviken recon is for brain dead people. healing is OP
[0:40:42] masakari333: I've never played this but finals looks complicated
[0:40:50] NotFissure: Imagine having 3 heal beams and 2 are just for show xD

[0:40:58] SpaceisLife: They say skill issue as a joke but realistically its just people play these games with no stop
[0:40:59] Nycolas407: They have no healing, no turret, maybe their Q key is broken

[0:41:14] TimonJB: I really hope this game doesnt get ruined by cheaters. I remember fortnite seemed like it didnt have cheaters for years after release, and i think thats a part of the reason of why it was so popular
[0:41:17] 4sp3x: !rustsens

[0:42:04] muffinlb: Finals is not complicated at all. Problem is people will get owned by a troll build and think it's good.

[0:42:10] SexyBootyFart: its so easy to see @TeddyTran_
[0:42:10] masakari333: Fortnite was so popular because it was popular, but sweats eventually ruined it by build mode mastering. Any game is wayy better with a huge playerbase.
[0:42:16] yubzuzi: @TeddyTran_  aint even that bad
[0:42:21] sou1gun: hope my 3080 can run this
[0:42:22] doublefarce: @chat are there news about Project Astrid?
[0:42:24] disflux: @OneManPush Happens when games promote damage over class ability. In OW, Ana/Bap/Moira are some of the best DPS in the game, so they ignore healing. Tanks are almost always the highest damage, so they ignore actual "tanking" with positioning.

[0:47:13] gum___: should use the revolver, you could own with the aim you got
[0:47:16] disflux: @OneManPush Perhaps. But it's an industry problem. WoW had the same issue. There was such a lack of available tank players in the game that they uber buffed all tanks to be the highest damage dealers, and effectively got rid of threat to focus on taunt executions. People just don't get as much of a dopamine hit from Healing/Tanking as they do full out dps.

[0:57:51] Loot_Doctor: their guns have a higher TTK
[0:57:53] SovereignAii: @mocskospatkany yes
[0:57:53] lecam82: lights are so fast it's broken
[0:57:54] DelayKnee: @tonio_77 nah. damage is good but still not better than the ak
[0:57:56] onepunch_doggo: Light absolutely sucks compared to heavy I still love light though
[0:57:57] qxzzzy: @crispy_zebra same
[0:58:01] Newtyson: This is solo ranked?? Why he have teammates???????
[0:58:04] ahi_boy: @gs_arcane i wish i was into them at that time, only got into pc gaming around 2009-2010

[0:58:11] kaizenherr: just like irl
[0:58:12] BringYoAGame: I dont think light needs more hp, I think heavy needs less ways to 1 shot light LUL
[0:58:12] LEGITvPANDA: If light had over 180 health to not get 1 shot by explosives itd be better
[0:58:18] cmanatlan: casual window jump tutorial in the middle of owning
[0:58:20] kittynyahn: monkaS

[0:58:25] grandlarsene: He makes window jumps look easy
[0:58:27] KontrolStyle: nty
[0:58:28] daddydungeon12: did they nerf the damage on the pistol btw? for light??
[0:58:28] plebichu: heavys rein shield needs an hp reduction, med beam needs a longer recharge time
[0:58:30] weirdarpeggi_: a small heal after kill could help heal ability seem less vital
[0:58:31] 1Ksiaze: I think if light had 25 more hp it would break the class
[0:58:31] Enterthenoob: @shroud think this game has longevity?
[0:58:32] mocskospatkany: @SovereignAii so whats the point of healer than?
[0:58:33] lecam82: nt
[0:58:34] VentiKyo: @mocskospatkany Yeah, after some time without being hit, life regen
[0:58:35] marq4d: you know hes listening now, ask for heals
[0:58:35] onepunch_doggo: Either heal increase for light or a stim
[0:58:36] kittynyahn: me when i get turned to gold
[0:58:37] bluBEgeekin: is the ebr good for light??
[0:58:37] inik27: yo chat, is 1080p max resolution on twitch? why does the stream look like 480p
[0:58:43] vzout: the guy with 1 hp also would have liked a heal i bet
[0:58:44] mocskospatkany: @VentiKyo than whats the point of nth healer?
[0:58:47] gs_arcane: @newtyson solo queuing, not playing solo (theres no such gamemode in this game)
[0:58:48] turtlesalad_: Pog frag
[0:58:50] sou1gun: time to lose my life over for this game
[0:58:52] ahi_boy: @inik27 twitch bitrate is pretty bad

[0:58:56] SpaceisLife: @inik27 Bad connection
[0:58:58] selby1: playing this game solo is cancer everyone is so bad
[0:59:00] Grumpyjakey: Lyric makes the light class look insane
[0:59:02] thrifty_paradox: no shot
[0:59:03] SovereignAii: @SovereignAii Just look at the time it takesbefore he starts to regen, healing beam can be used mid combat
[0:59:03] ItsAPonzi: @shroud what FPS do you get?
[0:59:04] kittynyahn: @karlmon peepoHug
[0:59:06] darko1848: @shroud did you check out once human?
[0:59:09] ahi_boy: @inik27 so when lots of movement on screen, it gets pixelated
[0:59:09] crispy_zebra: @qxzzzy ive only played for a few days so i dont want to start bitching about having more health, but the heavy players with rpgs have to stop lolol
[0:59:11] marq4d: you know hes listening now, ask for heals Û†ÄÄ
[0:59:15] D3FT: if you don't run heals on medium you're trolling. so many ppl run turret
[0:59:16] kittynyahn: O-o

[0:59:19] Fatchi7: Solo is hars

[0:59:38] selby1: @Dujomirko a game

[0:59:52] not_ashar: ok
[0:59:52] SpaceisLife: @vinists Near impossible to win
[0:59:53] MulletPw: @sponduli_ ResidentSleeper
[1:00:00] arsh73552: Do you think 3 heavies might be the play where you just destroy all buildings
[1:00:01] toechiii: does twitch not show the game being played?
[1:00:06] Ling48: make damage delay healbeam
[1:00:09] 1337RAIDS: LOL
[1:00:14] VentiKyo: @mocskospatkany It need to be a relatively longtime without being hit to regen. Healing skill is good but isn't necessary.
[1:00:15] Mcnuby: nah medium is
[1:00:15] luckilyvz: rpg just one shots light with rpg
[1:00:15] WolfJuliana: !finalssense
[1:00:15] Fossabot: @WolfJuliana His sens for The Finals is 40
[1:00:16] Jkist7: how could heavy be nerfed in a way that wont break it
[1:00:17] iHuse: Heavy sledgehammer <3
[1:00:17] Loot_Doctor: They need to balance very Carefully because Heavy Should have the slowest TTKs because they have so much HP  Lights should have the fastest TTK because they have so little HP
[1:00:18] sponduli_: @MulletPw thanks for replying my neighbah, welcome to Kamar Taj. Ill teach you sumn
[1:00:23] SovereignAii: Heavy is so annoying
[1:00:26] StinkyPig: heavy with what weapon
[1:00:27] Outsiderek: Why did someone timeouted me? Lol xD
[1:00:28] Pearsonify: Light with Camo is so fun
[1:00:29] Zebidiah27: if i gotta watch this avatar game ad one more time im jumping out my window (im on the first floor)
[1:00:29] MulletPw: @sponduli_ ResidentSleeper
[1:00:31] sif_f: why?
[1:00:34] rianflexer: Which one are you using?
[1:00:35] ahi_boy: stay out of range of heavy and its not op
[1:00:36] merry_legs: heavy just unfair
[1:00:37] addy__p: at the end its a team game soo
[1:00:38] SeanThiccc: I only like heavy for smashing buildings
[1:00:39] gs_arcane: @crispy_zebra rpg splash damage is the only real issue with heavy
[1:00:42] SpaceisLife: @Jkist7 make it slower
[1:00:42] skybridged: does the game run better since the nvidia update?
[1:00:45] SovereignAii: Literally cannot kill heavy as light, unless you absolutely dumpster them
[1:00:51] Grumpyjakey: Stun gun with double barrel and invis is good
[1:00:53] ‰ªïËà¨: Light only viable cuz of glitch nade
[1:00:54] HeadlessClient: @StinkyPig heavy with shotgun or lewis
[1:00:54] sponduli_: @MulletPw I see your handlers only input the same code into your little vessel.
[1:00:55] merry_legs: in this game a lot of stupid cheesy shit for no reason
[1:00:57] Nooner2: haven‚Äôt played tourny and/or ranked yet. when you team wipe does it cost a coin?
[1:00:58] Payday55: light is bad only when there is more than 1 on the team, esp 3
[1:00:59] zTrxpical: @ahi_boy he has 2 shields and can easily capture the point with tm8s
[1:01:00] the____witcher: can you play one game as a heavy?
[1:01:00] MulletPw: @sponduli_ ResidentSleeper
[1:01:03] luckilyvz: you you gotta hs tank '
[1:01:05] VentiKyo: @mocskospatkany the best use for healing is avoid to being 3rd partied after a teamfight
[1:01:09] Bilalgrlek: Bilalgrlek subscribed with Prime.

[1:01:12] Fossabot: @yungcvc He's using the Logitech G303 Shroud Edition Wireless - With a Logitech G840 XL Gaming Mousepad shroud Edition. Grab one while you can!
[1:01:14] Chinu959: I dont understand how you can give high power weopans to high health class?
[1:01:19] SongsWithoutWords: this game needs a more causal mode like team deathmatch or ffa, i just want to shoot people sometimes
[1:01:20] luckilyvz: hs tank or u dead
[1:01:22] unknown9271978747: Light = Fun & Weak Medium = Medium Heavy = Bored & Strong
[1:01:23] dazai_dazzle: heal and defib are best tho‚Ä¶.
[1:01:23] PeepoLegends: shroudyyyy plinK
[1:01:24] boatjesus: dome shield and mesh shield should be mutually exclusive
[1:01:27] Mcnuby: heavy needs a medic to be good
[1:01:30] SamULJackson: how does this game affect lebrons legacy though?
[1:01:31] NinjaDJack77: light damn near doesnt exist in this game with how op heavy is
[1:01:33] Labeta: So three heavies could be the meta?
[1:01:34] VentiKyo: @mocskospatkany or heal a revived teammate fast
[1:01:35] asorras: NotLikeThis
[1:01:40] LingWinny: Monaco is broken af
[1:01:43] jodaladro: 2 medium and heavy
[1:01:43] iHuse: HUH
[1:01:43] khalil25265409: is it good ?
[1:01:45] Im_Alpha_Zed: heavy with a shotgun will wipe teams by themself
[1:01:45] sponduli_: @MulletPw If your bloodline needs help, please feel to contact me. As I look around I can see you lack the mighty Vril and or Esse to continue your bloodline strongly.
[1:01:47] LEGITvPANDA: That shotgun melts
[1:01:47] dagoodme: What do you think of bringing sword to a gun fight game?
[1:01:47] Im_Alpha_Zed: no heal needed
[1:01:48] GlutenFreeVapes: HUH
[1:01:49] lecam82: AlienDance
[1:01:51] vinists: theres the heavy LUL
[1:01:51] jodaladro: Best combination
[1:01:52] Med13val: @Chinu959 typically how it works in games.. the tradeoff is mobility
[1:01:52] rafik1200: @chinu959 aren't they weaker (execpt for close range)
[1:01:52] SpaceisLife: @Labeta yep
[1:01:53] Sandeeptha: Honestly for the amount of hp the heavy has with the shields combined, it should only be melee like reinhardt or something
[1:01:53] juleszszzz: @Labeta 2 + healslave med
[1:01:55] crispy_zebra: @Labeta nah, too much moving around to do
[1:01:57] nabinko_: All classes are super fun to play tbh
[1:02:00] stx_diviniity: light with double barrel and invis is the move
[1:02:00] LingWinny: I can't even play it on AMD stuff, sturrey mess. All the other maps are fine
[1:02:00] addy__p: best team comp with the classes?
[1:02:01] owelaypapi: 2 lights and one heavy is the best by far
[1:02:02] flucchetta97: @shroud
[1:02:03] Pearsonify: @SovereignAii 1 on 1 heavy is easy to kill as a light. 1v2 its difficult if they know what theyre doing.
[1:02:03] 1Ksiaze: They need to disable melee weapons for ranked play
[1:02:06] nanomach1n3: shroud plays medium?
[1:02:07] donhuanxinfinite: Clearly the vision behind this is a super realistic combat simulation
[1:02:07] mattyice_97: mattyice_97 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 18 month streak!

[1:02:09] the____witcher: can you play one game as a heavy?
[1:02:10] millionboysss: is this game worth buying at full price?
[1:02:17] flucchetta97: @shroud ur facial hair looks like the lotro preset lmao
[1:02:19] DehlishONE: not that close tbh
[1:02:19] Fellowsoph: lmao they are using easy-anticheat, this game will be inflated with cheaters
[1:02:21] plebichu: it honestly still has decent range
[1:02:21] benjborg: @millionboysss its for free
[1:02:21] D3FT: especially if you're heavy you better be close
[1:02:22] Ken9875: how is the game=
[1:02:24] onheadaddy: what is that ben10 soundtrack
[1:02:26] DehlishONE: the heavys shotgun shoots pretty far
[1:02:28] plebichu: it honestly still has decent range, needs a damage fall off increase
[1:02:29] iProd_xD: üêà
[1:02:30] Med13val: @millionboysss i'd pay triple full price
[1:02:30] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[1:02:30] Bi0h4z4rd_: @millionboysss it's free tf u mean

[1:02:32] maxx1682: @DehlishONE considering it's free i say yes :)
[1:02:33] dagoodme: shotgun + grenade launcher combo the best in beta
[1:02:34] VentiKyo: @millionboysss it is free
[1:02:38] SpaceisLife: @millionboysss Its free thats the only reason why people play it
[1:02:38] thrifty_paradox: i just hate how you have no secondary like not even a pistol
[1:02:38] lecam82: you should try the sonar spe maybe monkaHmm
[1:02:43] GettinFilthy: plus they have a rocket launcher
[1:02:45] Niemand013: @millionboysss is free to play
[1:02:47] quattro_szn: I find the TTK is crazy long in this game. fast pace is fun but ttk is kinda wild
[1:02:50] millionboysss: okok
[1:02:52] rafik1200: @shroud you tried sniping in this game?
[1:02:52] millionboysss: thx
[1:02:59] boorae159: light should deal more damage, heavy less, keep HP the same
[1:02:59] gs_arcane: to balance it out a bit better, have the heavy have less splash damage with the rpg (think it‚Äôs 150 atm??) and reduce the shotgun range, have that and the light class instantly becomes more viable
[1:02:59] juleszszzz: your team made of paper OMEGALUL

[1:07:17] its4D4: light pistol needs nerf too
[1:07:18] Perfectclear: just reduce health of shields
[1:07:18] horNNN_: the invisibility / melee builds and heavys with rocket launchers will be the end of it lol
[1:07:20] gs_arcane: @tony_2_tap prolly Q3 2024 maybe Q4?
[1:07:21] pawJuno: shields aren't that big an issue in ow2
[1:07:21] Garalic: Heavy shields aren't even the problem: its the C4 on explosive canisters that's the real issue
[1:07:22] miata_tekid: @quattro_szn ty :)
[1:07:22] ACrazyBull: im going to go insane
[1:07:24] Sadokist: have to limit to 2 classes per team, and balance heavy

[1:07:36] coalers59: glitch nades counter shield right?
[1:07:37] PigeonSpy: the heavy shield should not be able to have teammates shoot through it
[1:07:38] supaspecimen: @Garalic c4 canisters are not broken what OMEGALUL

[1:07:50] Taki_R6: no, they are trio Kappa
[1:07:51] SpaceisLife: @DSLow Nope
[1:07:53] FelionTV: use glitch nade against shield easy fix
[1:07:55] Garalic: @supaspecimen Getting one-shot as a medium is insane though
[1:07:57] Cheapshoty0uth: shields in fps are generally a bad idea
[1:08:00] Pearsonify: @Med13val I usually top frag in kills, damage, support and obj as this build on my team. Ill try medic though but that turret can be such a perfect distraction

[1:08:31] Perfectclear: next patch if all they did was reduce heavy shields, make healing have a warmup timer, and not let you place c4 on throwables, the meta would be broken and you'd see invis shotgun only
[1:08:33] supaspecimen: @supaspecimen just have your other med rez lmao mediums already have so much going for them, as a light i hate c4 canisters but it's part of the games identity

[1:50:11] grimfate08: i am black
[1:50:11] xhairbait: yeah would force people to have a heavy comp
[1:50:14] alphazero15: He would
[1:50:16] LuckkyJay: i think one shot light and mediuam and 2 shot heavy would be fine
[1:50:16] dutchdairyboy4: It gets mediums one shot
[1:50:17] YungieLA: @Zyfella @Mawntee Its a fun game, but its clearly marketed more towards competitive which is one of biggest recipes of dying out quickly.
[1:50:18] irregularkhun: medium is not 1 shot hs? thats dumb
[1:50:19] itsmehueyy: !glaases
[1:50:19] Unbiddenarachnid: heal and shield is just busted and sniper is one of the better light weapons
[1:50:22] theemagician: fuck snipers it'll ruin yhe game
[1:50:22] robbstarrkk: the only thing that should die in one hit is light
[1:50:22] cmanatlan: the fact that it leaves them on 20 hp is weird, it's like you're meant to melee them after
[1:50:24] redrum66666: how u like the game so far after release?
[1:50:24] darcss: @grimfate08 no one asked

[1:50:27] Taskymaskyy: Is Mike gayyyyyy ????
[1:50:29] fabiottt_: what are the ranks in this game?
[1:50:30] aaaaaaalguien: sniper only can headshot lights
[1:50:31] Fostiir: i think 240 dmg on mediums
[1:50:34] grimfate08: i am a black person
[1:50:34] xhairbait: plus sniper is useless in comp
[1:50:34] itsmehueyy: !chair
[1:50:35] Fossabot: @itsmehueyy, he is using the Embody Gaming Chair from Herman Miller x Logitech https://bit.ly/HMxLogitech (With a Herman Miller Eames in the background)
[1:50:37] WatchfulTomato: fuck that
[1:50:42] edsp_provolone: @taskymaskyy not possible
[1:50:42] ACrazyBull: one shot headshot?!!
[1:50:43] rydeus: is this the normal rank for this game? tournament style?
[1:50:43] Jonasbaki: You should try the akm
[1:50:45] alphazero15: @grimfate08 i am red
[1:50:46] ACrazyBull: eeeeeeh
[1:50:48] stagnozus: lights are shafted and one shot by everything while meds actually survive
[1:50:48] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[1:50:50] ACrazyBull: i don't know
[1:50:50] Zebidiah27: 250 would be 1 shot mediums
[1:50:50] onepunch_doggo: Gotta up the light health if ya gunna do that
[1:50:53] remali1991: @dinezfps what the fuck is you name FPS for real ahahahah
[1:50:54] inbunzwebust: one shot torso light
[1:50:55] Waxed_wookiee: It should 1 shot headshot mediums IMO
[1:50:55] DaFlea420: @grimfate08 wanta cookie?
[1:50:55] Directors3: I thought AKM is better than the FCAR
[1:50:57] dutchdairyboy4: Best gun in game right now is actually l11 (m1 grand) if u can hit ur shots and control recoil
[1:50:58] romans_l0_9: @darcss i bet he isnt
[1:51:01] c_a_c_o_: nah bro, lights are already annoying enough

[1:51:08] AriesNah: @shroud 5 years cancer!!! THANK YOU FOR THE AWESOME MEMORY
[1:51:08] Mawntee: @Zyfella It's marketed towards the comp scene, but for me as a casual I've been enjoying the crap out of it. Even casuals can stiill pull their weight and enjoy it which is really neat
[1:51:08] grimfate08: black maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
[1:51:10] NihilBoy: that trade off seems pog
[1:51:11] Taskymaskyy: @edsp_provolone not possible how ???

[1:51:16] theemagician: No
[1:51:16] Gaks_Designs: @dutchdairyboy4 is that the shotty?
[1:51:16] SidTae: Put a charge up timer like widow maker to make it one shot medium
[1:51:18] Delacroix22: @Taskymaskyy  you got no chance with him anyway
[1:51:18] SlemSlem: !monitor

[1:51:21] kittynyahn: PeepoWtf
[1:51:22] theemagician: It'll make the game terrible
[1:51:24] Robdogfogdog: Quickscoping is easy in this game so that would be busted

[2:59:09] DomskiPlays: this is the old Overwatch dillema all over
[2:59:11] DivineHarrisy: i dont play ranked though either so its probs a whole different monster, but in "casual" mode 80% of the time my friends and i have to throw to get the games to go longer , those events make it more fun and we run L/M/H
[2:59:13] KidJabu: back in beta, 3M with utility was hella stronk

[2:59:50] accidege: @Guts_777  I dont remember asking what one was better or your opinion on games. You dont have to fanboi your fav games when someone brings up another one.
[2:59:51] Pwinzor: 2 heavy 1 medium probably bis
[2:59:52] ariyanowl: 3 heavy with shotgun in op

[2:59:54] ItsDainty: hey Dad, my little brother wants a mixer/amp for Christmas..I recently saw that the GOXlr is no longer being maintained by TC Helicon. Any recommendations?
[2:59:55] Talonxx: @TheAlbanianMamba winning in a random non ranked tourney and winning in high plat/diamond is way diff
[2:59:57] michaelbear17: triple heavy is insane
[2:59:57] spadecr: @shroud what do you think about only 1 ability per team?
[2:59:57] MojoBroJo_: Triple heavy and rotate shields with shotguns sounds broken lol
[2:59:57] dutchdairyboy4: Pog squad is two mediums and a heavy
[3:00:00] youngslimer: I feel like the devs put in the time to make 1-1-1 the best setup lol
[3:00:01] imnotacanadian: How does this chat not move 10 million miles per minute with 20k people watching

[3:00:10] blad3_77: they need to nerf cloak
[3:00:11] ParzivalFPS: dz lost to triple heavy
[3:00:12] RaZoX144: Imagine being hit with 3 RPGs, seeing 3 domes on CO, and mines/shields/charges
[3:00:14] Florio_BAR: I dislike light simply because you get 1 shot by heavy rocket launcher
[3:00:17] KeirianGSG: light with glitch but heavy has 2 rpgs
[3:00:18] FloHost: its almost like its balanced
[3:00:18] ChevalierKnight: The reason two m and one h is so strong is you can res both medium then heavy instantly and you have the shield from heavy and troythy system
[3:00:22] ryujota: a simple glitch nade wins you the game
[3:00:25] Talonxx: 2 heavy 1 m and the medium on healbot is hard to break through
[3:00:25] haelruc: Light with Glitch is going to be meta as fuck
[3:00:27] HurricaneHurley: @imnotacanadian because watching and chatting are 2 different things
[3:00:30] Ghushin: Is it true this game is based off a true story
[3:00:31] orjanoboyy: are some things unbalanced in the game u think?
[3:00:32] Jayconius: I think 3 lights playing 3 roles can be OP, Sniper, Rush and harras
[3:00:33] Ethanhogben: @FloHost fr xD
[3:00:36] chenille_verte: heavy is so strong
[3:00:37] rottnpossum: @imnotacanadian botted views and lurkers lol

[3:00:41] juhi_: i always get fucked by 2 heavy 1 medium teams
[3:00:42] machriphi: Meta is M H + Wild Card
[3:00:43] MojoBroJo_: 3 Light with all with stealth and glitch / gas to combat point could be crazy if they play together

[3:11:01] machriphi: @Big_Moda No, team wipe restarts respawn timer for everyone, removes 30% of cash, and then you all respawn without using tokens. Otherwise you could just get eliminated from a game.

[3:32:34] VampRyan1: chat what is this game?
[3:32:39] THCTyrant: @ChevalierKnight high dpi means u will use your wrist more and thats bad for your arm in the long term, if u get a larger mouse pad and more space you might find lower dpi more comfortable and you can try arm aim
[3:32:39] mrperson1234: @ChevalierKnight dpi is just a multiplier for the ingame sensitivity so depends what sens you are using in games
[3:32:40] jcraser: @ChevalierKnight dpi in itself is not a problem, as it may just mean you use a lower in game sens setting
[3:32:41] machriphi: @ChevalierKnight DPI on it's own is meaningless. It's DPI x In-Game sens. But the most common DPI in shooters is 400 or 800.

[3:34:20] Cereal5: @ChevalierKnight Generally lower DPI (and sensitivity) lets you make more accurate movements. The downside is you have to make large sweeps to turn around. That's why full desk mouse pad mats are common.

[3:41:53] isthatmeeeq: !thefinalssettings
[3:41:55] machriphi: @ChevalierKnight No, if you're legitimately using that sens it's impossible to aim. a 20cm/360 is considered VERY fast but still viable for a small amount of people with excellent mouse control and you're using something 6 times faster than that so I think you might be mistaken by what your DPI is.

[3:49:58] brinxtruk: @xtzc who could've guessed one of each class would be a good comp
[3:49:58] istaylaughing: which shotgun?
[3:50:00] machriphi: @stinkyholettv There's plenty of information on it, and if you look at what pro competitive players use in every game it's pretty clear than 20-60cm/360 is viable. If you're insane you can maybe make 15 or 10 work, even if it's not optimal, but a 3cm/360 is unheard of because moving the mouse a single millimeter on your mouse pad will make you turn 12 degrees.
[3:50:01] kpsowns: What keybinds are you using for The Finals?

[4:10:06] machriphi: @dutchdairyboy4 I disagree. Outside of console performance issues which were real, the game released with a huge map and a lot of content. Most of the negative situation is because people thought it would be a traditional Fallout campaign and not an online survival game, which is what it always was.

[5:13:35] lilskullzy: @unclekappa69 light is solid if you utilise movement n hit n run tactics tho, so perhaps just the other things but light doesn‚Äôt need a buff
[5:13:40] realbadwizard: Gas mines should not produce gas if destroyed instead of triggered.

[5:14:30] yungkrab: :(
[5:14:31] ChasePackk: light is usable but its just requires like 5x the effort to get 80% of the value you can get by just blasting people with the suto shotty lol so its kinda dumb rn

[5:14:33] Anakinw: @yungkrab this is better than cs lil bro
[5:14:33] lilskullzy: they should however buff the drop off for throwing knives @unclekappa69 also I agree
[5:14:34] DecayingKatana: anyway i can see them stats shroud
[5:14:34] The_MrX_: @Tyr4 I think its one of those things where light is stronger vs worse players, the good players notice people in stealth way more often.

[5:23:08] junglebird12: @Widurrr me
[5:23:08] DemonStrate86: @Sleepe18 Do not spend that much on a "first PC ever". It'll be a complete waste. Max you should spend on your first PC right now would be like 2k. I'd probably go even less than that honestly.
[5:23:11] lilskullzy: @nevadaooo thanks Gaben

[5:24:22] DemonStrate86: @C_Moola You can get a really capable PC for gaming and streaming for 2k. That only depends on the graphics card since it goes the capturing and displaying of the games.
[5:24:23] ShadowGrip: @Stryd3rrrrr same. Game frozen and then loaded back in with that error
[5:24:27] UncleKappa69: @ @lilskullzy only in normal games for fun. in ranked im forced to play medium since my tm8 plays light

[6:02:06] BengieWoW: Quick tip - no point in lusting P1 - you'll have two sets of adds which can be cleaved down easily (also dps remove GotW because of resistances), can help CC the MC's. Lust P2 - pull the boss in the middle and spread apart from the ghosts, helps with reposition and dodging.

[7:11:41] morph3euz: them boys doing their thing
[7:11:42] Modal_1: in the 20th century
[7:11:42] spooky_diplomat: the power of the Vag, has proven idol worship as long as man has roamed
