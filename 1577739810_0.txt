[3:19:16] Electafuzz: we go 6 months with nothing, and then BAM
[3:19:24] mavericks312: its like there trying to get all the products out before the take over in june
[3:19:44] vulkankragon: @mavericks312 why?
[3:19:48] bypized: They proabably see numbers that people dont really stick for classic besides the fanboys?
[3:19:52] Zomgboy: check underwater for those boxes
[3:19:54] snuffles_80: dragonflight even possible to release this year?
[3:20:06] Neowanderer: $80 bucks for wraith epic seems a bit money grab
[3:20:22] mavericks312: @snuffles_80 extremely possible from what we have seen

[3:20:50] Jewishraver: @Neowanderer look at each mount being 25$, then the pet for 10$ and then month of game time too. kinda makes sense
[3:21:16] mavericks312: @Neowanderer your not looking at the items as idividuals
[3:21:24] Zomgboy: @Towelliee underwater are some boxes near those ships
[3:21:33] CuresEighty: underwater
[3:22:06] Zomgboy: yeah 2-3 of them

[3:23:41] KralYoshii: @Towelliee Hey Towelliee here is a link for a working details. https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files/3909532
[3:24:05] mavericks312: cant send it in a top loader knowing damn well its gonna get damaged in the mail
[3:24:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: take my money, grade my shit
[3:24:09] Skittless96: can we make DKs in prepatch?
[3:24:10] Neowanderer: i was always worried the card would get lost or damaged on the way to get graded
[3:24:19] vulkankragon: i bet microsoft is wondering if only we would have acquired ABK sooner we would be swimming in that wrath money right now
[3:24:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Skittless96 yes, need a 55 on a fresh realm though
[3:24:49] mavericks312: @vulkankragon not really on MS its more so on the govt to approve the deal
[3:25:23] theoldgodmd: !server
[3:25:27] EpicscoreEu: can you transfer your classic tbc to wotlk?
[3:25:34] Skittless96: @Skittless96 can I make a DK only on the realm I have a lvl 55+?
[3:25:39] theoldgodmd: !wotlk
[3:25:40] Moobot: @theoldgodmd I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[3:25:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: @EpicscoreEu its automatic
[3:25:51] Eikus11: thinner but they hold the card better

[3:26:00] Alastree: Top loaders are bad for protecting cards. The softer ones are way better.
[3:26:03] BG_Plays: @Towelliee How was your raiding yesterday?
[3:26:08] Eikus11: I own couple of hundred graded cards
[3:26:13] abracka_: @Skittless96 the level 55 rule only applies to fresh realms. you can create a 55 DK on any other realm, even if you have no toons leveled there
[3:26:31] theoldgodmd: Feels to me like wotlk classic isnt nearly as attracting people as classic or tbc was, maybe its just my perspective but twitch hype seems kinda mild
[3:26:35] paragon_3: You could bribe me
[3:26:40] Skittless96: @abracka_ ty
[3:26:53] yulelogged: hes a yankee doodle
[3:26:54] venom366: i mean you could fly and get it graded LUL
[3:26:54] Aspectt10: On my server the trade chat is full of Anal Jokes xDD
[3:26:59] fakevaltteri: Here's what I do. Use the softer protector. Cut out pieces of cardboard and use painter's tape to secure it. Then wrap that all in bubble wrap and ship.
[3:26:59] vulkankragon: @theoldgodmd wow viewership is over 100k right now
[3:27:03] mavericks312: when you buying that joey gallo yankee card towel lol
[3:27:12] happyspot: it's only the prepatch though
[3:27:30] synixqt: @Towelliee without being a Colts homer.. First pick fantasy draft half ppr. Taylor or CMC
[3:27:39] HoboFighter2: If they added the dungeon finder I would be playing...
[3:27:43] FusionKissMe: thats what turned me off tbh
[3:27:46] CuresEighty: same
[3:27:54] pvtpilot88: same
[3:27:54] Rottencoarse: it turned me off for sure lol
[3:27:56] mavericks312: @synixqt taylor easily cause CmC is an injury waiting to happen
[3:27:58] warrenny: Its stupid
[3:27:58] Neowanderer: play an mmo to solo i dont get it
[3:28:05] Roottii: People are waiting for Legion
[3:28:05] ZakuzaGB: surley they dont do a cata lol
[3:28:12] ZakuzaGB: but they might cos moneys
[3:28:13] EpicscoreEu: They need to reduce the Trash farm in the game and focus more on the Story/bosses and essential stuff.. peoples attention span is shorter now days with smart phones. @Towelliee
[3:28:38] Neowanderer: you cant really consider cata a classic version that was the turn to current retail
[3:28:39] HoboFighter2: @Roottii guilds get turned off when I can't guarantee being on certain days because of work and kids
[3:28:47] FusionKissMe: Not about solo its about not wanting to spam a chat for a group, and or watch a chat fly by trying to look for a group lol
[3:28:56] Vaedrun: But what will they do then?
[3:29:02] vulkankragon: @EpicscoreEu i haven't touch my smartphone for 2 weeks
[3:29:05] abracka_: even private servers show there is no interest in cata
[3:29:08] paragon_3: which is a bummer because I loved playing a priest in cata
[3:29:11] ExanimisGG: u think they will stop with classic at wotlk?
[3:29:17] paragon_3: no other expansion has matched that style
[3:29:19] cpaulttv: why level new characters agane?
[3:29:19] ExanimisGG: @abracka_ do not be so sure
[3:29:28] Holysal: @Vaedrun its the end thats what it means
[3:29:28] SpyCrabbo: imagine going to classic to play with the talent trees we're just now getting rid off
[3:29:29] ZakuzaGB: they should stop at wrath and just do fresh servers/leveling events every now and again
[3:29:30] theoldgodmd: Give me dragonflight prepatch
[3:29:33] synixqt: Mannnn my draft is saturday and I have first pick. It's killing me. I am afraid of Taylor with Matt Ryan's bum ass at QB Lol I feel like you can stack the box vs that Offense
[3:29:44] foofighters182: classic wod!? KomodoHype
[3:29:45] CuresEighty: @theoldgodmd +1
[3:29:47] HoboFighter2: @Towelliee what are those plans you think?
[3:29:49] Aspectt10: What are those plans?
[3:29:50] DovahChicken: Let's hope they make it hard! i want to see harder raids and not se a cheese fest  with naked level 58s
[3:30:01] EmpathyLiveChat: After wrath I hope Dragonflight will have been successful and more resources can be diverted to retail
[3:30:02] ExanimisGG: @abracka_ there is one p.s. that had 3k players at launch
[3:30:06] snuffles_80: wrath will be my last classic
[3:30:07] Crafty_plays: !wotlk
[3:30:08] Moobot: @Crafty_plays I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[3:30:08] Skittless96: after wrath they'll make new expansions and pretend cataclysm till shadowlands never existed Kappa
[3:30:11] jimbob93: id take taylor
[3:30:15] mavericks312: @synixqt name a colts WR outside of pittman jr
[3:30:20] lawles_walrus: trading pascal was the dumbest thing we ever did
[3:30:24] abracka_: @ExanimisGG that tells you all you need to know lol
[3:30:24] cpaulttv: just curious why lvl new characters
[3:30:26] Dirtnose: I took McCaffery but Taylor was a close second for me
[3:30:29] Bayne77: hines is going to take taylors yards :D
[3:30:36] Draz3nx: pittman is pretty good for the colts
[3:30:36] MrsPyra: @Skittless96 that would be neat
[3:30:38] vadder_fister: VapeNation
[3:30:50] CodyKane: People also forget the Colts o-line is like one the best in the league
[3:30:50] GoKu1g: !XP
[3:30:51] mavericks312: i would never take CmC for injuries alone especially since he carries that offense
[3:31:02] ExanimisGG: @ExanimisGG it was like their 3rd realm for cata
[3:31:04] spookychefkarolina: towOny towOny towNot towNot
[3:31:09] GoKu1g: @Towelliee Where can i get my hands on that XP weakaura u have at the top...?

[3:31:37] cpaulttv: why lvl again
[3:31:37] lawles_walrus: frank is not the guy for indy IMO, we traded pascal one of our best recievers since harrison
[3:31:40] TheBradest: I love that Towelliee is a video game nerd and a football nerd :D Just like me
[3:31:40] abracka_: @GoKu1g https://wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[3:31:41] synixqt: @mavericks312 exactly lol So what is to stop them from playing the Colts man up on the outside and forcing everything inside, crashing down on Taylor
[3:32:01] GoKu1g: @GoKu1g cheers dude!!
[3:32:01] Rottencoarse: @Phil87z  this year was cowboys right?
[3:32:11] mavericks312: @synixqt cause you can play taylor kinda like the chargers use to use tomlinson as a rb and a wr
[3:32:13] vulkankragon: it would make sense for classic to continue till mop. after mop classic should stop.
[3:32:20] lawles_walrus: I found endzone tickets for the colts commies game for $100 a ticket, snagged those bad boys quickly
[3:32:34] espenes95: sorry, ur probly not a fan of link's but https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=44957/greater-inscription-of-the-gladiator#sold-by is missing from pre patch?
[3:32:53] naznarens: cata and mop are not classic
[3:32:58] TacDuc: Classic SL
[3:33:03] Neowanderer: was it mop or cata where the skill tree changed
[3:33:06] TheCliffyShow: Mists of Pandaria: Remisted
[3:33:06] TacDuc: The classic no one wanted
[3:33:08] ShadoodHD: but the lego cloak Pepehand
[3:33:10] ExanimisGG: u think they will stop with wotlk with classic? @Towelliee
[3:33:12] MrsPyra: I agree Wrath should be the same
[3:33:15] Rottencoarse: @Neowanderer  cata
[3:33:15] MrsPyra: last
[3:33:16] Karbonn: wotlk is the end of 'classic' imo
[3:33:19] abracka_: if you want cata/mop that badly, there are many private servers out there. don't hold your breath for blizzard to make classic/remastered versions of them
[3:33:25] TheCliffyShow: It also ruined Shadowfang Keep.
[3:33:44] cpaulttv: why lvl up agane??
[3:33:47] warrenny: @thecliffyshow Nah
[3:33:59] harpdarp: Firelands Heroic is worth it
[3:33:59] Rottencoarse: Deadmines RFC and SFK got changed lol
[3:34:01] sirwilliamfrost: Unpopular opinion, but Cata launch and expansion as a whole was so, so fun for me. Maybe it was my age and guild, but very fond memories
[3:34:01] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee I think what some people are wanting is progression servers like Ever Quest has right now 🙄
[3:34:06] upandaz: whats ur xp addon?
[3:34:09] ObamaEnvy: Cata isn't classic. I'd still play it though because I'm a degenerate.
[3:34:10] Draz3nx: wrath was amazing expac , cata is meh
[3:34:10] Kederawyn: !wotlk
[3:34:11] Moobot: @Kederawyn I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[3:34:12] mavericks312: idk man cata had its share of lovers
[3:34:17] TacDuc: Not if people vote for the expansions
[3:34:27] Alienfromger: they could do a mop legacy server LUL
[3:34:47] DudeTheMoose: Got any must have addons for leveling in WOTLK Classic?
[3:34:47] theoldgodmd: I think they will either go for a Classic+ (seems unlikely, doubt they have the money to have retail and classic pumping out new content) or start over again with Classic>TBC>WOTLK but with changes like Season of Mastery had and some new drops etc.
[3:34:48] MrsPyra: They should make new xpacks after wrath and do better the 2nd time LUL
[3:34:49] Blackminuz: do you get exp from mining?
[3:34:51] spookychefkarolina: @billysp34rs I don’t think it’s an unpopular opinion. The game is about having fun and enjoying it. So if you enjoyed Cata, there’s no shame in that.
[3:34:55] Goodnevi1: I'd play Legion again
[3:34:56] TheCliffyShow: Shadowfang Keep was such a unique dungeon. Then, they took out all the worgen replaced them with zombies after we just got done with an expansion full of undead.
[3:34:56] praylin: Does anyone know why the innkeeper gave me an "tabard of flame" on new wrath server
[3:35:18] abracka_: @praylin you're on a 6 month sub
[3:35:24] Strke1: They need to 100% go a different route after Wrath. Complete different direction
[3:35:24] j_bar111: @praylin 6 month sub

[3:36:49] harpdarp: A lot of people quit during Legion becasue it was bad until the end LULW
[3:36:53] Teidran: i just hated how legion killed alts
[3:36:55] Adryandwave: Same thingcan be said about Pandaria
[3:37:04] Biorrwolf: Wrath, MoP, and Legion are in the top 3 imo
[3:37:04] sirwilliamfrost: Legion pre-patch was some of the most fun I've ever had in an MMO
[3:37:09] abracka_: they should honestly make it animated instead of live action
[3:37:10] DryR: Reboot or sequel to the ewwy first?
[3:37:10] theoldgodmd: yeah i heard there was a writer for a new WoW movie.
[3:37:10] geokouts: Flying at 60???? just logged in classic wow
[3:37:17] Jaindreas: Can you multi track herbs and mining nodes at same time in wrath?
[3:37:18] theoldgodmd: if they dont make it about arthas its doomed again.

[3:37:23] captain_khyzan: Shadowlands Classic please!
[3:37:34] Thewunk: They totally need to make it about Arthas

[3:38:07] theoldgodmd: The WoW movie flopped so bad even with fans like me going to the cinema to watch it 7 times kekw

[3:39:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: better call thrall
[3:39:07] TheCliffyShow: @Thewunk Henry Cavill is way to old for Arthas.
[3:39:14] Thewunk: Better call thrall LOL
[3:39:25] qualybased: towelliee playing fresh gotta love it
[3:39:30] warrenny: @biorrwolf Yeah but vikings season 5 sucked ass losing him and the dumb civil war
[3:39:32] qualybased: the feels
[3:39:32] Thewunk: The Orcs just look amazing in the movie
[3:39:47] jerseyfive: just make the arthas movie...
[3:39:51] Biorrwolf: @thecliffyshow Henry as the Lich King, somebody else as young Arthas
[3:39:58] odinsdad75: everyone plays horde but there lore stories aren't as good as the alliance.
[3:39:58] Adryandwave: People also missed MoP because they were like ''OMG this is Kung Fu Panda'' so an argument can be made for a remaster too, there's plenty of people that love MoP enough to re-live it again
[3:40:02] Clucky2988: what addon is that xp bar on top?
[3:40:09] theoldgodmd: I went to a WoW lucha libre event for BFA here in mexico with my gf back then and we were the only ones with WoW tshirts on in the whole arena LUL it was kinda fun
[3:40:13] Neowanderer: yeah so much hopium for the wow moive and then so much disappointment
[3:40:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: !wa
[3:40:17] Moobot: @HaxzorJimDuggan we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[3:40:29] Electafuzz: I loved pandaria
[3:40:31] Crowdog76: What you think of leveling addons like Zygor?
[3:40:32] Electafuzz: mostly for the pvp
[3:40:35] crushlemons: You think there is a chance of WOW coming to consoles?
[3:40:39] iamWaritself: I wouldn't mind going back to MoP if they did a remaster of it.
[3:40:39] Biorrwolf: @warrenny I disagree. I feel that Ragnar was running his usefulness and we needed space for new blood. The transition into the Arc with the kids was powerful
[3:40:41] AkemiSuna: MoP wasnt as bad as people say it was tbh
[3:40:44] MrsPyra: i loved the little farming dailies idea
[3:40:49] skymercii: MoP will always be the best expansion... im planning to die on that hill
[3:40:53] DryR: They should focus a movie on an adventurer experiencing some lore instead of the lore itself...
[3:40:55] spookychefkarolina: @akemilive agreed
[3:41:03] peeeaaak: I’m gonna be honest I was one of the people who skipped it because of the art atyle
[3:41:05] MrsPyra: i pvped in mop so i didnt get to see much of the pve stuff
[3:41:10] Undercover_Baby_Jesus: !FRESH
[3:41:11] Moobot: @Undercover_Baby_Jesus Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[3:41:15] Deadelus0: Morning @Towelliee!
[3:41:17] cpaulttv: hey why lvl again btw??
[3:41:24] warrenny: @biorrwolf Oh i loved those last 4 eps i just couldnt find intrest in the warring brothers
[3:41:29] AkemiSuna: Getting into Jade Forest for the first time was poggers asf
[3:41:34] spookychefkarolina: @bloodyreapr that’s a steep hill LUL
[3:42:18] Biorrwolf: @warrenny Bjorn alone was a stronger character than Ragnar. The other kids though, besides Ube, I can agree Lol

[3:42:24] Tyrammus84: I remember everyone being mad at the amount of daily quest in MoP
[3:42:31] Biorrwolf: @warrenny I'm finding Valhalla hard to get into though
[3:42:32] Teidran: true that
[3:42:35] mavericks312: id agree with that
[3:42:36] lawles_walrus: it was the prettiest and most tranquil
[3:42:37] TheCliffyShow: Even though, Pandarens were created before the Kung Fu Panda movies.
[3:42:41] odinsdad75: agreed
[3:42:45] BobLongMVP: Timeless Isle release day was the ABSOLUTE best!!!!
[3:42:46] AvrithSATX: MOP was great excluding everything related to Garrosh.
[3:42:48] Neowanderer: mop was great and it was out of left field not expecting pandas
[3:43:01] Biorrwolf: Everyone griefed the pandas, but here we are, with MoP being one of the best expansions
[3:43:03] jerseyfive: everyone hated mop on release and now everyone loves it
[3:43:04] warrenny: @avrithsatx Nah including garrosh
[3:43:08] sirwilliamfrost: Shadowland and BFA are great in concept, but the execution was the problem
[3:43:13] spookychefkarolina: Fans spend so much time asking for something different and then MoP came out and all I heard were people complaining
[3:43:15] mavericks312: i think the panda's are what made ppl dislike mop

[3:43:28] odinsdad75: yeah i wish the Garrosh story could of went diferently
[3:43:40] ObamaEnvy: MoP was wonderful.
[3:43:42] DovahChicken: @Towelliee  why does the bones move like grass?
[3:43:43] juga27: i loved having a little farm
[3:43:48] NewWorldReign: How would you rate the current races in WoW?
[3:43:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: i liked the music in MoP
[3:43:52] Bayne77: i didnt like the style but i didnt hate MoP
[3:43:55] DABZ16: is wrath out now?
[3:43:56] Adryandwave: Everybody talks wonders of MoP now
[3:44:00] foofighters182: Shadowlands classic KomodoHype
[3:44:05] Adryandwave: I wish they remaster it
[3:44:07] TheCliffyShow: I remember seeing a ton of people saying how they wanted Pandarens for years. What happened to those people when MoP released?
[3:44:12] spookychefkarolina: @haxzorjimduggan second that
[3:44:15] Technogre: I started playing right at the end of MOP so I didn't get to experience it... I got stuck with WOD
[3:44:20] Electafuzz: Athene LUL
[3:44:21] falldrgn: MOP was great. WOD  endgame content sucked, but the story was great and the leveling experiece was good
[3:44:24] AvrithSATX: I never understood the hate for the Pandaren.
[3:44:25] Biorrwolf: Blizzard needs to learn that their best expansions have something to do with the Legion
[3:44:27] VrtniPatuljak: ppl hate pandas then go play fuzzy rats
[3:44:28] spookychefkarolina: @thecliffyshow exactly
[3:44:34] a_demeaning_cow: Pandas were going to be in classic in swamp of sorrows…not like it’s not in the lore people just are sensitive in the WoW community
[3:44:37] SensationalBanana: MoP is in my top three, if not number one. Loved the class design and 5.2 in particular.
[3:45:03] warrenny: @a_demeaning_cow In general
[3:45:06] Biorrwolf: I miss Frost DK Obliterate from MoP
[3:45:08] spookychefkarolina: Loved the cinematic for MoP as well. But I’m a simp for Cinematics
[3:45:22] ExanimisGG: worgens twickelLOVE
[3:45:23] VrtniPatuljak: vulpera KEKW

[3:45:55] odinsdad75: lol
[3:45:57] Biorrwolf: MoP got shit on because people who didn't know the lore thought it was stealing from the DreamWorks films
[3:45:57] falldrgn: MSV was not hard.
[3:46:02] DovahChicken: MoP raids was awesome

[4:20:41] ForgottenTime: They ruin any franchise they touch
[4:20:46] Mitune: Wonder if Microsoft will give Blizz more devs
[4:20:54] Sollice: @ForgottenTime Like?

[4:21:24] Cheapshoty0uth: They don't shill mobile games as hard as Activision has been
[4:21:32] MILESkg21: spellbreak got screwed imo
[4:21:38] Mitune: true but they are still relatively small for how big Wow is. At least to my knowledge @Electafuzz
[4:21:40] Sollice: @ForgottenTime Oh your talking about movies. Then yeah. I think we were talking about games lol
[4:21:51] BoezIRL: this is the blood knight quest, do it
[4:21:53] Endeavourz: @ForgottenTime Films and games are different fields
[4:21:54] spookychefkarolina: And they’re not going to torpedo the cash cow

[4:21:56] Endeavourz: Not the same
[4:22:04] Lightasaurus: Overwatch def up there
[4:22:14] ForgottenTime: There is no game by Sony that stands out as good minus the new spider man game @sollice
[4:22:14] mavericks312: action rpg is debateable these days
[4:22:17] SonofHorus82: yeah between Actiblizz and Bethesda they're gonna kill in 2023.
[4:22:20] Clicklesly: And MOBA Kappa
[4:22:21] Electafuzz: @MilesKG21 game was fun, just nobody played it :/
[4:22:23] Cheapshoty0uth: Let's be real here the cash cow they got is King gaming and candy crush
[4:22:29] Endeavourz: @ForgottenTime Lay off the drugs
[4:22:30] Sollice: That being said, what has Sony movies screwed up really? Other than Morbius

[4:24:44] ForgottenTime: they needed to wait till the end to mkae sure it was the movie and not JOHN CENA
[4:24:44] procyon_mfc: that movie was sick
[4:24:45] spookychefkarolina: Morbius was feelsbadman

[4:25:17] HaloS23: @Towelliee Im hoping i can find a collectors bindle for both top guns
[4:25:24] spookychefkarolina: @gamingdad77 sad I didn’t get to experience that one in theaters
[4:25:44] BoezIRL: ever
[4:25:51] insanekandor: ireland i guess
[4:25:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: you should leave Kappa

[4:26:02] TheItalianStallion321: Top Gun Maverick was a really, really good movie, i liked it a lot. saw it last week
[4:26:05] SpoofAvatar: lol
[4:26:05] PvtHudson093: its magic water
[4:26:06] BoezIRL: 29
[4:26:09] GamingDad77: @spookychefkarolina i didn't either...watched it at home. can't imagine how much better it would have been in theaters
[4:26:18] Electafuzz: I'd agree

[4:26:55] Anachron10: havnt seen the new one, but to prepare myself for it, ic seen the old one, pretty boring movie i thought lol
[4:26:56] Bulldawgx: TOP GUN was a top tier movie UNTIL Maverick came out.  The aerial stunts and total package of the movie stands out on its OWN and there isnt a movie that can come close to it in that genre
[4:27:00] freetherocktv: @Towelliee the actors were the ones in control of the shots while in the jets pretty cool stuff
[4:27:07] insanekandor: Just watched Top gun a month ago - Ruined it for by watching Quintin taratino's take on it first
[4:27:09] Parduke: lmao
[4:27:15] PvtHudson093: its all about the film Stealth
[4:27:17] spookychefkarolina: @gamingdad77 we have a five story IMAX theaters nearby and wanted to see it there. It probably would’ve been insane. Like you though,I’ll be watching it at home :(

[4:27:38] Redpandalol: @towelliee Independence Day best flight combat
[4:27:45] bypized: I mean, towards the end Top Gun 2 becomes Mission Impossible. But Im ok with it
[4:27:46] Ovium56: @Trawkey a legend

[4:28:59] Ovium56: I watched LoTR way too much since I worked at the movie theater at the time lol
[4:29:03] BJofBorg: Groundhog Day is my comfort film
[4:29:06] swags67: Hell yes Days of thunder love that and top gun.
[4:29:06] Deusey: godfather was boring
[4:29:08] DarkIntentz: Days of thunder 150% worth the watch
[4:29:14] spookychefkarolina: @gamingdad77 oh yeah! That theater I’m talking about is $16.50 a ticket LUL we don’t go often. I’d rather spend my money on a mount LUL
[4:29:14] charlie_the_snowman: @BJofBorg my man

[4:35:45] BobbyVex: leader
[4:35:52] venom366: spiritual attunement you put 1 point into :P
[4:35:54] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  F1 race in Vegas will be huge
[4:36:02] gladdsdaddy: lol Bobby clueless
[4:36:02] GamingDad77: only thing i like about F1 is the speed...
[4:36:02] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[4:36:05] Nokterian: F1 was suspense back in the 90's
[4:36:11] Bulldawgx: @Charlie_The_Snowman ive been a HUGE NASCAR fan for years and just really started getting into F1.  It has really opened my eyes to a whole DIFFERENT type of racing.  I really think that both F1 and NASCAR could really learn from each other
[4:36:28] Bayne77: f1 goes around in a circle, but dang if that circle aint some weird shape
[4:36:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: i know cole he always goes high
[4:36:34] mavericks312: i just cant see f1 ever being as big as nascar here in the states
[4:36:41] Nokterian: think monaco
[4:36:47] geokouts: Watch Monaco F1 race
[4:36:47] Bulldawgx: "THIS ONES FOR YOU HARRY!!!" @Towelliee
[4:36:48] xluckydawgx: They are doing it on the strip????
[4:36:49] BlewGamingGroup: lots of barricads
[4:36:54] yulelogged: you build a wall a really big wall some might say the best wall
[4:36:55] charlie_the_snowman: @Bulldawgg593 I like that you are open for F1 as a Nascar Fan.
[4:36:55] ProClicker: The Dune soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was great
[4:36:56] Nokterian: monaco is also street racing
[4:36:58] Darzetti_: i cna
[4:36:59] GamingDad77: oisn't nascar doing street races now?
[4:36:59] xluckydawgx: Here in miami they just did it at the Stadium
[4:37:06] TacDuc: Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make
[4:37:12] BlackCl0ud: NASCAR in US is like F1 in Europe
[4:37:15] DanielMorenoMiniatures: yeah for rednecks
[4:37:22] Nokterian: f1 has been around a long time
[4:37:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: nascar is easier to follow when you are drunk off your ass
[4:37:32] BuffiDoinks: It will be bigger, it’s the fastest growing sport currently
[4:37:38] charlie_the_snowman: HAAHAHAHAA

[4:37:51] lel3owski: nascar is amazing in person
[4:37:51] Parduke: Dirt track racing is Natty light
[4:37:53] jackvalentin: Hello all :)
[4:37:53] Chunky_Brothers: but F1 is currently fastest growing sport in world its mad
[4:37:55] spookychefkarolina: Netflix has a series on it I think, pretty dramatic - for a show about cars LUL
[4:37:56] LJayTeeVee: F1 is more like Wine
[4:37:58] BlackCl0ud: you got Kimi who moved to NASCAR this year
[4:37:58] GamingDad77: he has a point though
[4:38:00] Chunky_Brothers: give it ten years it might rival nascar
[4:38:06] Holysal: i like NHRA
[4:38:10] TacDuc: Meanwhile the whole EU is wondering why your water is colored
[4:38:23] spundancekid808: How we liking the leveling Big T

[4:38:27] charlie_the_snowman: F1 is slowly getting bigger like football(soccer)
[4:38:37] Bulldawgx: @Charlie_The_Snowman im for all kinds of racing.  I am trying to get my friends who are DIEHARD circle track to branch out.  I'll be honest though, it wasnt until Dale Sr. ran the Rolex 24 in Daytona in 2001 that i even knew about other options of racing.  Ive used other streamers on here, Giant Waffle for instance to teach me about F1 racing so i can pick it up as fast and i have NASCAR
[4:38:41] campingking615: hi all
[4:38:41] NBK_Sethus: true chads watch the World Rally Championship
[4:38:50] Darzetti_: I enjoy F1 nore than Nascar

[4:39:39] borrus_tv: got UI links?
[4:39:40] charlie_the_snowman: @Bulldawgg593 Oh cool man, I watch Giantwaffle too. We always watch the highlights of F1 and sometimes F2/F3 too after the offical race the next day. Its fun ;)
[4:39:47] Bulldawgx: I do wish thought that the F1 cars would go back to the V10 motors.  These engines today are not what i envision and F1 car should sound like
[4:39:51] GamingDad77: @Zethuz i love watching highlight videos on youtube...the jumps, highspeed corners and crashes
[4:40:06] BoezIRL: that's an orc
[4:40:14] charlie_the_snowman: @Bulldawgg593 true, the sound cant compare
[4:40:17] TacDuc: @spookychefkarolina Just making a comment on the beer, most of the EU does not enjoy beer from the US, as it is too sweet and light, as far as I've heard

[4:43:46] BlewGamingGroup: back in the day streamers would just not say which server they were going to start on and wait til after they started playing to tell people where they were
[4:44:02] charlie_the_snowman: Thinking about New World makes me sad
[4:44:08] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Or make you pay for it ;)
[4:44:13] bypized: @Towelliee Bellullar saying that Blizzard giving Shadowlands free boosts is Blizz being desperate. I see that as just a push for sales towards Dragonflight. Wrong?

[4:50:56] bypized: Prediction for diablo 4 launch?
[4:50:57] UltraPixelP: Especially now that Diablo 4 will launch alongside console versions
[4:50:59] TacDuc: Yeah, I want to play D4, but it also depends on how busy I am with university, and how much time I spend on WoW
[4:51:02] Alienfromger: depends on monetization
[4:51:13] c0mmander_starscream: it would be really funny if another game put out an expansion during the first month of Diablo 4 release
[4:51:13] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW

[4:51:37] xsp00n: @Towelliee it was like 30mill, idk where the fk i got idea that it was 1.1b
[4:51:45] SpookyJamez: it was like 30mil in 2015. I'm sure consoles murdered that number even more.
[4:51:53] borrus_tv: need ashes of creation
[4:52:07] Templexx: ashes of cash
[4:52:16] mrmanno14: ashes when towel's in a wheelchair

[4:52:27] borrus_tv: ;)
[4:52:34] c0mmander_starscream: Quins of Creations
[4:52:38] borrus_tv: na thats star citizen
[4:52:39] sosadu: hahahahaha

[4:52:44] PvtHudson093: i will be 60 by the time Ashes comes out
[4:52:46] Xetherot: need that riot mmo...
[4:52:47] sosadu: my dream is that it comes out by end of 2024
[4:52:49] bypized: Id say my grandkids... My kids will be playing Star Citizen @Towelliee

[4:53:28] jerickus: Did you ever play Rift?
[4:53:28] UltraPixelP: Unrealistically? Next week
[4:53:30] Karbonn: I want to say you're wrong but I can't. Feel like it's never coming out. Will be old and outdated before it launches.
[4:53:31] pigzip: What about the riot game when do u think that will be ready ?
[4:53:35] WSquiggle12: For beta maybe KEKW
[4:53:39] stressley89: end 2025
[4:53:43] sosadu: thats a good point @Karbonn
[4:53:47] TacDuc: @bayne77 You need to atleast have them be self-sufficient, otherwise you need to care for them while the game starts
[4:53:58] bypized: It will come out like Star Citizen came out
[4:53:59] xendros78: with the cash they're making on the vaporware cosmetic packs, there's no incentive to hurry up and launch
[4:54:01] BoezIRL: I want the riot mmo towDance
[4:54:14] sosadu: riot mmo seems to be the best bet
[4:54:19] Shywisp94: which game we talking about_
[4:54:20] Wcvechten: It's  like Cyberpunk, promise so much, but now you gotta make it all true due to expectations
[4:54:24] sosadu: copium
[4:54:29] xendros78: AoC will be on UE 8 by the time it manages to launch, assuming it launches
[4:54:34] SpookyJamez: wonder when we're going to hear some new stuff from these new, ex-blizz, companies
[4:54:44] iblighters: Riot mmo has another 5-6 years before it comes out
[4:54:48] bypized: @Towelliee People hyping up the Riot MMO, we havent seen a thing yet. LUL
[4:54:51] Thoreya: tommy level 51 at 16 hours holy LUL
[4:55:11] jerickus: Have you ever tried Rift?
[4:55:14] Karbonn: @sosadu Like if it takes 5 years to come out, sure it looks good today, but will it look old and no one wants to play it in 5 years? Kinda sad
[4:55:20] JesikaPlays: JesikaPlays subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[4:55:24] BoezIRL: @jerickus he did
[4:55:29] Dirtnose: @bypized It's more so that Riot are a known studio that make good games
[4:55:41] sosadu: yeah precisely, i cant imagine what sort of improvement we'll be seeing in both systems and graphics in 5 years
[4:55:51] paethos: Rift was how i found you
[4:56:02] thenormalbeast: Riot has good track record
[4:56:09] DanielMorenoMiniatures: alpha patch today?
[4:56:11] TheBroCrow: hopefully the anticheat's not as shit as it is in valorant
[4:56:14] Xetherot: they already finished the world for the game too
[4:56:16] Karbonn: Rift is still a great MMO.
[4:56:17] xsp00n: riot doesnt announce anything till they are almost ready for the alpha
[4:56:17] Glitchv0: !ui

[4:56:29] ratgefingah: will your channel points change for df release? what would it be instead of anima if you did?
[4:56:33] visaeris412: riot has a boatload of money and some pretty good minds behind it
[4:56:46] Wcvechten: League, Valorant, TFT, Legends of Runeterra, and some other upcoming games next to the MMO too @bypized
[4:56:54] bypized: They even did the same things that Blizz was doing in the office LUL
[4:57:17] TheBoogs: I enjoyed The Ruined King game
[4:57:19] BoezIRL: it's like talking about a new marvel movie. people are talking about phase 6 and we don't even know what movie are coming
[4:57:20] Nerendis: Runeterra is easily bigger than azeroth
[4:57:23] visaeris412: the single player rpg they made was pretty good
[4:57:30] GamingDad77: Currently watchingArcane...it's pretty good
[4:57:32] bypized: I get that, but people hyping the mmo like its going to be the WoW killer. Heard that kinda story before
[4:57:33] raynestormfur: @brtur @Towelliee Dragonscales! since we will be killing many dragons/dragonkins?
[4:57:55] Nerendis: Nah but like EK, Kali, Northrend
[4:57:56] TacDuc: Honestly, it's an MMO, I like it. So I just hope there are abilities and such that feels great
[4:58:03] ratgefingah: @brtur cobaltHMM
[4:58:35] Nerendis: They also have a big game to build off of, unlike ashes of omegalul
[4:58:37] BoezIRL: and they have a good lore
[4:58:39] tomcio_76: @Towelliee  remember wildstar it was good but not WoW killer
[4:58:40] xsp00n: and they already have the world and lore basically there just like Warcraft did
[4:58:42] c0mmander_starscream: "Rift coming WoW Killer" 2011
[4:58:48] TacDuc: Dritties, instead of snitties
[4:58:49] Wcvechten: Damn well know it means there's going to be no ret paladins in the game with GC there
[4:58:49] bypized: Throne and Liberty is the real WoW killer Kappa
[4:58:50] cyberzombie72: cyberz10HB cyberz10HB cyberz10HB
[4:58:52] Razzin_: the CubicleCrawler?
[4:59:22] Defocus: Defocus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak!

[5:00:08] ratgefingah: I just wanna play a frikin bilgewater pirate man
[5:00:10] Shywisp94: it-ll be another gacha ill bet
[5:00:28] TheZander: I thought Riot hat control over their IP independent of tencent
[5:00:37] RedXIII: @jerickus he said on twitter back in the day he was focusing on fornite competitive and leaving the game in the past. don't know if that changed
[5:00:38] Xetherot: what if ten actually wants a sub based game lol.
[5:00:38] funnyc4t: Can you make a DK on a fresh server?
[5:00:43] Templexx: gotta have both?
[5:00:44] bypized: And the skins in a riot game are a HUGE part of it
[5:00:51] Defocus: they need to add mogging in wotlk
[5:00:57] Razzin_: skins will be expensive, if we look at Valorant skin prices
[5:01:03] bypized: So... Idk that goes well with an MMO where transmog is so important
[5:01:05] SLoPPYALieN: you had me until NCSoft...
[5:01:05] BoezIRL: @funnyc4t you have to have a lvl 55 character before
[5:01:05] GamingDad77: @funnyc4t after you lvl one character to 55
[5:01:08] Xetherot: NCSOFT LUL
[5:01:10] alextheory_: !FRESH
[5:01:10] Moobot: @alextheoryguy Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[5:01:15] CYNIC308: monthly sub or F2P with selling "convenience"
[5:01:26] Nerendis: Riot has zero control, that's been public
[5:01:26] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[5:01:30] ratgefingah: what about a battlepass type of deal
[5:01:35] c0mmander_starscream: CCP has total control over TENCENT
[5:01:35] bypized: Ready to pay 59.99 for a transmog in the MMO
[5:01:35] funnyc4t: Oh that make sense you need a 55 char first. Thanks
[5:01:36] Thoreya: if its f2p thats so huge
[5:01:53] ChrisarN: No alpha news for this week mr. @towelliee ?
[5:01:53] Templexx: no way its box priced. i can see a sub for bonus stuff outside of free
[5:01:54] captain_khyzan: yea.... NCSOFT games are a no from me dog... bad track record of deleting games instead of fixing them
[5:01:54] owl_gg: subscription to keep the game clean
[5:01:57] Thoreya: and attract a lot of players
[5:02:04] GingerPurple: Nah rito MMO will probably follow same monitization of league of legends, sell tmog/mounts on the sthop
[5:02:05] Roaringkittylol: no box price - monthly sub?
[5:02:07] GamingDad77: @funnyc4t but you can make one on non-fresh servers w/o having to have a lvl 55
[5:02:18] Nerendis: There's over 100mil acting League players. That would be insane
[5:02:24] Artenuous: there's so much hype about it anyways
[5:02:25] BoezIRL: true
[5:02:27] Nerendis: Active*
[5:02:33] c0mmander_starscream: Tey'll will probably do a F2P micro-trans model
[5:02:42] Funderik: copium
[5:02:56] Defocus: but will it succeed over wow though
[5:02:59] Zettabyte: towCopium
[5:03:03] tomcio_76: league of legends mmo ?
[5:03:20] BoezIRL: they already do stuff with twich
[5:03:28] c0mmander_starscream: Towelliee going to get that mandingo sized streamer contract
[5:03:30] CYNIC308: WoW capped out at +13 million monthly subs but that will probably be beaten month 1 if done properly! LUL
[5:03:41] abracka_: bet they'll offer it to shroud
[5:03:45] Reaghol: id sign >.>
[5:03:52] alextheory_: kind of smart for the future of gaming with stream
[5:03:55] Funderik: don't see that, they havn't done it for any of their other games, so why would that change anything
[5:03:55] cahoots82: I don't know, I don't think the type of players that enjoy LoL are necessarily going to enjoy an MMO.
[5:03:56] BoezIRL: will you consider it if it's good?
[5:03:57] Roaringkittylol: They do it with Call of Duty - makes sense with MMORPG of this scale
[5:03:57] maccaruso: Towelliee exclusively streamer new Riot MMO confirmed
[5:04:29] Roaringkittylol: ^ Leaked
[5:04:43] Funderik: @Yoloblocks call of dury isn't made by riot.
[5:05:19] thenormalbeast: Something you would consider?
[5:05:21] vulkankragon: how many pve servers?
[5:05:27] abracka_: one of the reasons i'm particularly excited about it, is because ghostcrawler is leading it
[5:05:28] Defocus: they can pay all they want but it wont make the game any better.
[5:05:56] abracka_: they need to offer towel that "fuck you" kind of money
[5:05:57] skiller2b_: Also remember Riot belongs to Tencent, which is way bigger than any other mainstream company currently in Twitch, AND is Chinese market which by itself is gianourmous
[5:06:00] Funderik: those are some wild takes considering their no promise of the game even releasing.
[5:06:10] CYNIC308: like REALLY good with amazing combat and story and graphics and shit
[5:06:23] unhoiyman: is shaman worth lvling in wrath?
[5:06:23] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || The Dragonriding Talent System - Everything you NEED TO KNOW - Glyphs and Tree Breakdown youtu.be/1ezKtBius9o
[5:06:30] huemaahn: at that point they should just hire the streamer
[5:06:34] c0mmander_starscream: Mico$oft will
[5:06:41] TriumphantToad: why don't they, i think that'd be cool
[5:06:49] Razzin_: last time MS paid creators, Mixer bankrupted
[5:06:53] zysmos: microsoft will put the dollars
[5:06:53] alundrius: wow is like budweiser, it kinda sells it self
[5:06:57] zysmos: i wouldn't be too worried
[5:07:03] Darzetti_: Ego
[5:07:09] Mecabeast: @towelliee there's already level 60 dk soloing guides for blood furnace lol
[5:07:17] alextheory_: its like not even being sponsor by their mobile game
[5:07:19] Parduke: Microsoft will just make Riot MMO not compatible with Windows
[5:07:32] skiller2b_: WoW will e giga again after 2 things: 1: microsoft includes wow subscription into game pass. 2: wow is available to be played in xbox
[5:07:38] CYNIC308: the heavyweight champ doesnt ask people to fight him for the belt! LUL
[5:07:50] BoezIRL: behind you

[5:08:13] zysmos: tbf i don't think riot's mmo will be appealing to a lot of wow players
[5:08:18] raynestormfur: @skiller2b_ its not THAT far fetched tbh
[5:08:24] MortiousPrime: LOL

[5:08:37] Defocus: We made you!
[5:08:38] Revoca: BUT at the same time why do they need to ?? no MMOs has really been even close or on par with WoW
[5:08:40] GamingDad77: Towliee is always exposed...lol
[5:08:41] Bayne77: towelliee already exposes himself
[5:08:42] OnePlayerPete: Cheeky fuckers
[5:08:48] Goiur: was sarcasms kekw
[5:08:52] MortiousPrime: Anybody that "pays in exposure" is bullshit
[5:08:54] Vannadil: Yikes Blizzard
[5:08:56] Funderik: i just don't see a point even talk about riots mmo's... we don't even know the name of it, it's the "league of legends mmo", there's nothing to be excited about or doomer about, there's just nothing there.
[5:08:58] dongathon_: imagine wanting to get paid for your time /s
[5:08:58] DaltonIRL: Let me pay my utility bill with all this EXPOSURE
[5:09:00] Stariot: what server are you on
[5:09:04] Mufko2: !wotlk
[5:09:04] Moobot: @Mufko2 I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[5:09:06] Razzin_: member that one time when Blizz esports pocketed extra money from players?
[5:09:07] skiller2b_: @skiller2b_ def not. think with me here: they are already implementing console friendly features, such as camera targeting, hold to cast, renewed action cam
[5:09:21] c0mmander_starscream: "Blizz - You should feel privliged to be streaming our product"
[5:09:28] spookychefkarolina: Exposure doesn’t pay the bills whether you’re you or a small streamer. It shouldn’t ever be considered a form of payment.
[5:09:38] Roaringkittylol: Has a sense of entitlement
[5:09:38] c0mmander_starscream: yeap

[5:09:51] skiller2b_: @skiller2b_ Also keep in mind MS(Bethesda) already knows how to make MMOs for consoles, see ESO
[5:10:00] Utmost777: Chad gaming company
[5:10:04] c0mmander_starscream: Hopefully Micosoft cleans up that culture
[5:10:12] Vannadil: Big pass on them
[5:10:15] Ranzinz: nothing like competition to improve things
[5:10:16] borrus_tv: sony is the next dream cast
[5:10:23] CYNIC308: Blizzard only got bought out because they lost so much money on OW-League! LUL
[5:10:27] Goiur: any chance wow suscription gets included into the ms games suscription?
[5:10:29] GrazzloTV: @skiller2b_ i think zenimax made eso not bethesda
[5:10:32] SpookyJamez: How much exposure to pay for rent?
[5:10:41] tebbix: Blizzard is so behind in nowadays marketing strategies, one example is drops on Twitch

[5:12:16] c0mmander_starscream: "If you do XYZ, you will get A
[5:12:24] skiller2b_: @skiller2b_ yeah you're right, and Zenimax is MS also, the idea remains. Idk, I have a feeling that this is on the way somehow. not in the next months but in a mid-term future
[5:12:24] NieIas: $100 for 5min???
[5:12:25] CYNIC308: DONT YOU HAVE PHONES?!
[5:12:26] vulkankragon: @Goiur why would ms include wow sub with gamepass? it means less money for ms

[5:13:45] Kinghorn: blizzard with streamers is like nintendo with internet

[5:15:20] Akermay: @Akermay Got it, thanks
[5:15:21] CYNIC308: Blizzard doesnt see itself as a huge dev studio that has been putting out sub-standard poor quality stuff for the last 10 years except Legion and OW1
[5:15:22] NieIas: what level can you mount towelliee

[5:19:33] Molvonos: It lives in our hearts at this point
[5:19:36] EKS90_: @CYNIC308 DIdn't say it had to be great, just said there are blizzard products except those 2 which I thoroghly enjoyed a lot, so to me they did more than just 2 things.   Doesn't mean they are great by comparison to other dev studios or other games that came out.
[5:19:43] BlewGamingGroup: thats why sock on head was good when it went down

[5:21:29] Talok85: the northwest quests are level 14-15ish

[5:23:55] abracka_: cata feral was something else
[5:23:56] ArcaneSyntax: i've seen 40s on the fresh servers lol
[5:24:04] Technogre: if there's 1 there's 2 Kapp
[5:24:06] mavericks312: yea after that feral pulls an avatar never to be seen again

[5:24:22] Wcvechten: disc feral during cata, good arena times
[5:24:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: @praylin they may have turned it off by mistake at the innkeeper, check an inn to turn it back on
[5:24:26] TowersOverYou: hey what are the new servers?
[5:24:36] Neuxx: Guys i cant find the Eu new servers. Anyone that can help?
[5:24:38] Tyrammus84: theres a 51 pally on ally side on maladath atm
[5:24:42] CYNIC308: @Commander_Eggi agreed if you like it then keep on diggin it but im not sure anyone can name a 3rd blockbuster for them in the last 10 years is all im saying. They've been declining for a while and living off of the ideas and the work of the people that came before the current devs.
[5:24:45] praylin: @praylin No at all, just playing like normal, just got wrath by having retail like him
[5:24:46] BlackCl0ud: i think the PvE server will die rather quick
[5:24:47] Parduke: u got all your plague blood
[5:24:50] Timothious: Yea the pop is concerning
[5:25:00] Dirtnose: think the pvp one has a lot more people, at least on eu
[5:25:09] stressley89: peeps are playing DK
[5:25:20] praylin: ah he will check, ty
[5:25:34] thilgan12: I would’ve done it but I have so much gold that I grinded on another server. I don’t want to have to farm gold from scratch to get dual spec, epic flying, etc. again. Otherwise I’d love to go fresh
[5:25:45] skiller2b_: The classic blood elf running animation feels more natural than retail, retails is super weird idk why
[5:25:47] Retpally9329: did an AV on Grobb and 90% of it was DK's
[5:25:48] EKS90_: @CYNIC308 I wanna give the new devteam some benefit of the doubt with Dragonflight, hoping for the best there!
[5:25:49] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[5:26:00] spades1991: @thilgan12 same man.. i farmed so much gold not thinking there would be fresh

[5:28:13] GodlyCPK: To walk in is 8.  To do decently well is 13
[5:28:16] Rainhart31: to walk into RFC is 8
[5:28:33] EKS90_: @CYNIC308 I don't mind it being barebones WoD style without gaarrisons actually ,since they seem more inline to bring it to "modern times" with settings and a bunch of revamps. which to me is a good thing.
[5:28:33] SoScrumpy: !fresh
[5:28:33] Moobot: @SoScrumpy Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[5:28:38] vulkankragon: at low level you can't see any loot

[5:30:06] Glynn11: Glynn11 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[5:30:07] CYNIC308: yea you would think after almost 20 years every major NPC would have dialogue and/or a quest or something to flesh them out? like WHY hasnt Blizzard spent money on Ai in mmos? Blizz should be leader in Ai but they dont reinvest into WoW its just a golden goose they are terrified to fuck up because the current devs arent half as good coders as the original devs
[5:30:08] GamingDad77: @christoferdb23 depends on you. feel like releveling all over again? go fresh.
[5:30:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's going to take 20 minutes to get there LUL
[5:30:16] Rudric_Ice: fucking blizzard
[5:30:17] Crafty_plays: dungeon finder was released in wrath wasn't it?
[5:30:19] CYNIC308: wow that was longer than intended LUL
[5:30:19] Tiamarilien: holy pally but only level 12
[5:30:28] Crafty_plays: So that will be available after 9/26?
[5:30:40] alextheory_: the game would be better
[5:30:45] BoezIRL: they should just enable dungeon finder for normal difficulty so that player can do it for levelling
[5:30:52] Tiamarilien: cool
[5:30:57] Talok85: did all the rfc quests, was sooo much exp
[5:30:57] NieIas: they should make leveling dungeons available till level 70 atleast towelliee
[5:31:39] Lenietwitch: how are the talents here ?
[5:31:53] Zomgboy: 1 in UC, 2 in TB 1 in orgrimmar

[5:55:47] chonklord1: !fresh
[5:55:47] Moobot: @chonklord1 Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.

[5:55:55] GamingDad77: @propwash80 pretty much. and a mount
[5:57:03] Dirtnose: @vulkankragon they're permanent like all the other current wotlk servers
[5:57:24] Dirtnose: unless blizz closes them like the recent closure thing they did with the super dead realms

[5:58:48] Zilberg: Doubt it other then the login system saying High Pop or full etc

[6:07:38] ribcut: can someone explain the concept of classic to me? I love cs:go for example, but I don't wanna go back and play 1,6 like it's 2008
[6:07:57] 3663Sharad: 3663Sharad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! Twitch Prime is not a crime KEKW
[6:08:02] LearnedSomething: but 1.6 was superior in many ways
[6:08:02] Trikloo: game time
[6:08:02] ninedraft317: mount
[6:08:03] Rob3phones: Mounts and game time
[6:08:04] Kuocolaya: mounts and wow time
[6:08:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: game time, mounts
[6:08:04] GrazzloTV: mount pet and 30 days of gametime
[6:08:05] Brumbs: just mounts and game time
[6:08:07] Orcmondo: game time and pet
[6:08:07] Jokervenom1978: 2 mounts and game time i think
[6:08:07] symegaming: one is game time
[6:08:07] MrSnekyDino: Epic is mount and 1 month
[6:08:08] loragheta: the mounts and game time
[6:08:13] SpaghettiVanHalen: you dont get the mounts or game time with heroic
[6:08:13] tenmillion: the $80 u get the mount/pet/gametime
[6:08:28] BlackCl0ud: the mounts i think
[6:08:29] ribcut: @shytam I agree. The word was applies here. It was better for it's time, just like gta 3. I don't want to dust off my ps2 for gta 3 though?
[6:08:32] Trikloo: 30$
[6:08:34] tenmillion: $30 difference
[6:08:34] Rob3phones: 30 bucks difference
[6:08:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: i thought tb zep was cata
[6:08:37] SpaghettiVanHalen: 50 and 80
[6:08:38] GrazzloTV: 30 difference
[6:08:41] tenmillion: so ur paying like 10 or 15 for a mount basically
[6:08:45] Hawkzerr: 1.6 was the best though. Just think of 1.6 but with somewhat modern engine and graphics.
[6:08:58] BlackCl0ud: 30$ diff
[6:09:00] salak_daddy: 800% vaule
[6:09:04] SpaghettiVanHalen: does anyone know how much gold comes with the boosted character?
[6:09:11] KythosMeltdown: boost/pet/fishing guy
[6:09:13] Kuocolaya: boost, pet and toy
[6:09:14] moose_noodlez: imagine paying for the WOTLK for a 2nd time LOL
[6:09:18] Hawkzerr: 5k gold.
[6:09:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Q3 profits just spiked with a $79.99 option LUL
[6:09:24] MrSnekyDino: $50 is boost, pet, toy. $80 adds mount and time
[6:09:25] ribcut: @hawkzerr once again 1.6 "was" the best. It was better 15 years ago. There's  a reason people play cs:go now though. Why would you go back?
[6:09:26] BlackCl0ud: if you don't have game time, it's actual worth
[6:09:29] LearnedSomething: ribcut I know plenty of people who are happy to dust off old consoles to play old games they love
[6:09:32] skiller2b_: @Jason_Broke We did it for Skyrim like 5 times lol
[6:09:34] LearnedSomething: this isn't an uncommon thing
[6:09:42] stallowned: LUL true
[6:09:52] LearnedSomething: I still fire up my ps3 to play guitar hero every now and again :)
[6:10:03] Kuocolaya: took an almost 2 year break from wow and they still have me under their grip
[6:10:08] ribcut: @shytam and I know plenty of people who think the earth is flat. Just because people do it doesn't mean it makes sense
[6:10:19] QQisLIVE: Hows it going Bob
[6:10:20] ExanimisGG: so it was lvl 15 for a taunt...thought so but wasn't 100% sure....that is the reason i said best lvl for dungeons is lvl 15
[6:10:24] KythosMeltdown: no boost on fresh tho
[6:10:25] Karn1987: I just got my air ducts re sealed  now I'm geting a new ac unit and soler panels  soon
[6:10:25] R0yalFluffy: The difference between the 2 in CAD is actually dumb btw. You get the mount for less than a regular mount and a free month of sub...
[6:10:29] LearnedSomething: trying to make sense of what people enjoy is a rabbit hole
[6:10:31] Lilmistwuble: towCopium

[6:11:40] fearlessfungi: Benediction had an 8k queue last night

[6:46:57] skiller2b_: With the amount of boosting and everything IO and GS lost their purpose entirely, it's just inaccurate information

[6:49:41] brian_777777777: gross and bad
[6:49:45] Zilberg: Basically you never want to tell anyone you want an item because they will troll you LUL
[6:49:55] skiller2b_: @skiller2b_ Checking gear, fine, but auditing 2 or 3 third parties systems just to filter down if that player is boosted or legit? thats an L

[6:50:01] VaughanVenture: Split amongst everyone in the raid, in every GDKP I've done
[6:50:07] actually_pierce: it's split between everyone
[6:50:08] jrossino: So you start at level 1 or pay £35??
[6:50:12] bad_fish_too: Tank gets higher cut
[6:50:17] Mecabeast: gdkp exists now as hard carries
[6:50:24] r0b928: Woah. I’ve never heard of that. Is that in live?
[6:50:33] GodlyCPK: Some are still ran that way, but now it's a matter of getting "buyers" and "carries"
[6:50:39] TheItalianStallion321: in 1 GDKP, tanks and healers got an extra like 75g each
[6:50:44] jubee240: i use to make sooo much gold on them runs.  use to love when DBW heroic dropped that was a big big money maker
[6:50:45] EKS90_: @skiller2b_ Can check IO score now ingame without addons since its built in to the game, I don't like it, but its what blizz wanted so people didnt have to rely o nthe addon.
[6:50:47] SinicalDev: classic andrews ruined every old classic stuff that happened back in the day
[6:51:02] forksupdevils: What’s the best fresh server?

[6:51:32] moofia1980: @forksupdevils there are only 1 pvp and 1 normal per region
[6:51:32] r0b928: Who organizes it?
[6:51:33] Exxcar: @forksupdevils There is only one PVE/Normal and one PVP fresh server
[6:51:40] BlackCl0ud: that's why we did raid council
[6:51:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Recently, the glaive drops in TBC got insane with GDKP's
[6:51:54] skiller2b_: @skiller2b_ I'm in the side of the spectrum where Addons ruins the game experience (a part from interface addons), so I'm in for in-game solutions, altought I'm not a super active player myself  these days
[6:51:57] flebbooo: Was it Asmongold? KEKW
[6:52:06] actually_pierce: i thought you could only take 5k when server transferring
[6:52:17] warrenny: What a guy
[6:52:25] brian_777777777: yeah my dad left for a gdkp run and never came back

[7:49:33] ItsGigg: For me, the dungeon finder was great because you could just queue up and didn't have to sit in a capital city the whole time
[7:49:44] 3663Sharad: He knows POGGERS
[7:49:44] Whitemamba236: dungeon finder on ulduar release

[7:50:23] cothxd: its kinda funny cause all of the classic fdanboys cried over the dungeon finder saying it ruined the game

[7:51:38] sliproach: @MaximumSerg win key shits S
[7:51:46] ItsDerpDiggler: I'm betting you can still do that one by grouping with others using the LFG tool and just having them summon you to the dungeon though @Towelliee LUL At least I hope so
[7:51:50] sliproach: *shift
[7:52:09] Zomgboy: not deadmines?
[7:52:13] Shamwise: So not a fan of wailing caverns

[7:52:45] barefoot_on_bricks: @Hybridsteve Thank you!
[7:52:50] MerffTV: Just use the retail group finder and be done with it
[7:52:50] Yagr6: my spec is C tier so im already discouraged from playing ontop of the LFG thing
[7:52:56] feherlofia123: Stranglethorn vale is good pvp content. maybe later
[7:52:59] ItsDerpDiggler: I'm wondering if that achievement will work with LFG tool though is what I mean @Towelliee

[7:53:50] nitemare34godd: thank u so much
[7:54:12] AudioJaq: Nah
[7:54:28] Mecabeast: it's why in tbc hunters and locks could get groups and wars in classic for raids
[7:54:28] Denohar: i started tbc really late and it was so hard to find groups for the dungeons
[7:54:38] Verdell263: 2022 and they're worried about world diminishing...
[7:54:45] SoulToned: all im end up HAVING to do is quest more lol
[7:54:52] Ukiichrisgaming: Yeah I said to my friend not to worry because they will definitely back track on their decision
[7:54:56] Phatori: Thats such an odd thought process for a 15yr old game!!! Would "make sense" on new xpacks drops like with flying
[7:54:56] ItsDerpDiggler: Maybe they plan on releasing it with the ICC patch like they did back on retail? @Towelliee I hope so cuz it'll be nice to have it
[7:55:04] Arocian: immersion
[7:55:06] Meccka: Yes they want people in the world so that people don't just sit in the cities and level through dungeons
[7:55:06] Ukiichrisgaming: They've done that for many things in classic, I think it's a change they will make later for sure
[7:55:12] Zomgboy: where is your HS set?
[7:55:34] jasonbriggs: just get a mage too port you
[7:55:46] Zilberg: Gotta unlock Crossroads flight bath
[7:55:52] Kinghorn: mhmm
[7:56:05] MerffTV: Why is that degenerate though? According to Blizz anyway
[7:56:09] Meowrawrmoo: i know i want to spam wrath starting dungeons, but just for all the gear
[7:56:12] MerffTV: jsut let us play that way if we want
[7:56:21] Mecabeast: I bet pvp servers will have gang squads killing people on the zeplin to and from northrend
[7:56:22] Yagr6: because they want us in the open world for some reason
[7:56:22] Zettabyte: Disable the dungeons then, Blizzard Kappa
[7:56:25] Zomgboy: but for dps queues are longer so these ppl might quest meanwhile anyway
[7:56:27] SoulToned: especially an xpac most people have played already
[7:56:35] BigLoe: Need crossroads
[7:56:38] Meccka: Unless they give less XP from the dungeons.  and only a few quests per dungeon.
[7:56:39] copetvgaming: good afternoon @Towelliee love your content sorry im l;pate just woke up
[7:56:39] TombStoneMercenary: But But its all about the community. but I will pay to sit and have people run the dungeon for me
[7:56:43] Phatori: its a 15yr old game! They shouldnt be testing philosophy shit in this. Ppl have alrdy min/maxxed it all!
[7:56:49] mancow90: its fucking boring tho
[7:57:13] Collected1: boring tundra hahahaha
[7:57:15] Meowrawrmoo: lol yea, howling fjord all the way
[7:57:15] Reckless_Monk: yeah dungeon  spam is good
[7:57:16] Germcb2005: Snoring Tundra is awful
[7:57:36] Yagr6: i think they want u subbed longer as well, and spamming dungeons is prob faster
[7:57:49] Zomgboy: learn axes in orgrimmar
[7:57:50] Parduke: Ain't nobody got time for this
[7:57:51] TheGiant99: People say they want old classic but in the end they really dont.
[7:57:53] raynestormfur: @Germcb2005 fantastic for skinning tho :P
[7:57:54] enux337: axes
[7:57:57] MerffTV: Axes
[7:58:04] sptheory: they should at least add then "assist" mode for pets in wotlk
[7:58:09] Zomgboy: probably too much ><
[7:58:16] Zilberg: Sorry I am so hungry LUL
[7:58:17] theSalute: about tree fitty
[7:58:42] Mecabeast: I want classic but built around retails current engine
[7:58:48] MerffTV: Everyone loved dungeon finder. It's only a small set of folks that didnt
[7:58:51] Yagr6: blizzard devs just hard disagree
[7:58:54] Sollice: #givemeclassicwiththechangesiwant
[7:58:54] Peirsz: I burned out on Classic and TBC because I just couldn't sit there in LFG chat for hours
[7:59:07] Meccka: I heard you can already create a DK.  That was not the way it was in classic?
[7:59:10] 91Niki: @Sollice Sir sir, calm down with the long hastags, sir
[7:59:11] Sollice: You people dont know what you want with Classic
[7:59:14] mozavich: yeah it's built on legion platform
[7:59:15] mavericks312: its the small minority that doesnt want LFD like staysafe and esfand
[7:59:22] SinicalDev: they might have plans beyond WOTLK that make adding the LFD tool an issue
[7:59:22] BlewGamingGroup: every survey EXCEPT for the one that blizzard did says that all the classic players want the lfd tool
[7:59:22] Sollice: @Sollice LISTEN..ok
[7:59:23] Meccka: Grats on 18
[7:59:33] jasonbriggs: id rather just que for dung when i want too

[7:59:41] 91Niki: @Sollice Sir, I almost fell over your hastag cuz it was so long. sir
[7:59:46] mehowski: Like a joke
[7:59:47] XshadowturkeyX: what did blizzard recently stop?? mage boosting cause why to many where using it the non bossted couldnt get reg grps,, what did everyone wanna do? DUNGEONS
[7:59:51] mehowski: lol ;-/
[7:59:51] Mecabeast: like our current talents and abilities but all the classic quests/dungeons/raid stuff revamped

[8:01:59] Zomgboy: think small pearls are just for jc at this point
[8:02:00] lldeathlordll: i dont think LFG or like premade system will work well about dungeons, raids sure will you help you find ppl for raid instead of yelling in dala but LFD really made game more comfortable about dungeons before Mythic dungeons released into game, i understand that now normal or hc dungeons are a joke for example like level 60 characters in shadowlands but that helps a lot to ppl for leveling characters
[8:02:10] raynestormfur: do you even got money for that tho @Towelliee  XD
[8:02:12] Mecabeast: don't you need cross roads flight path first? or is that retail?

[8:03:18] GamingDad77: but NOOOOOO. blizz say we don't want what we want!
[8:03:21] Verrekk: My guess is that they will add the dungeon finder with ICC like it came out originally
[8:03:32] Nokterian: YUP
[8:03:34] khillakam: true
[8:03:37] MerffTV: Yep, you are absolutely right
[8:03:40] AudioJaq: No they wont- you clearly didnt play TBC classic
[8:03:40] mavericks312: @Verrekk just add it now no reason to make
[8:03:44] MagicHoof: LUL
[8:03:44] Phatori: When can we get the recolor judment armor from pre-patch event @Towelliee Thats all i want

[8:03:55] Peirsz: I cant fucking wait for LFD.
[8:03:58] Coumfy: hi can you talk about how pally is different in WOTLK?
[8:04:04] 91Niki: @Sollice Yeah the stealth heli got nerfed, and the rest of the heli's were already pretty balanced.
[8:04:11] mammaries1: @Peirsz NO CHANGES KEKW
[8:04:17] AudioJaq: @Peirsz might be waiting until you play retail
[8:04:20] theSalute: pog
[8:04:29] Peirsz: Spamming chat for dungeons actually kills the game for me
[8:04:33] Eredestra: Dungeon Finder is a MUST! Especially in 2022 since WoW has been on a spiraling downfall, there just simply isnt enough players to make groups with in Trade Chat
[8:04:37] jrossino: How long would 1-70 take?
[8:04:44] MerffTV: There is no tank shortage. There is a shortage of tanks willing to tank PUGs.
[8:04:50] mavericks312: @AudioJaq its only a matter of time until blizz listens to the majority that wants LFD stop it
[8:04:52] ArcaneSyntax: like outside of the big rush to level it takes fucking 40 minutes to get a group going
[8:04:54] gritbarontv: or the group dies because of one wipe, lol
[8:05:02] CuresEighty: @Eredestra lol, no
[8:05:12] AudioJaq: @mavericks312 You are the loud minority
[8:05:12] Alvari: DF beta when?
[8:05:13] abracka_: time to whip out the ol trusty "WTS tank services for heroic dungeons, 500g per"
[8:05:16] strike879: so kinda like a junkyard on live now
[8:05:29] Eredestra: @CuresEighty Lol, YES! Look at the state of TBC lmao! There is literally no one!
[8:05:36] mavericks312: @AudioJaq the majority are the ones who want LFD the minority is the ones who dont want it like staysafe and esfand
[8:05:38] SoulToned: if there were one server to rule them all the story might be different but tbd
[8:05:48] lldeathlordll: Does cross realm systems like raids and dungeons hurt the game ? idk how it will but heard it from some ppl curious to know why
[8:06:01] Surpriize: all that will happen is i will only doing heroics with guildies
[8:06:04] Darzetti_: truuuuuuuuu
[8:06:05] mrmanno14: truth. thats why no one would ever run class to TBC dungeons
[8:06:08] gritbarontv: or holding hands
[8:06:11] Mecabeast: then the item you want doesn't drop every time
[8:06:14] AudioJaq: @mavericks312 Believe what you want bud- its not the case
[8:06:25] Appendixx: !wotlk
[8:06:25] Moobot: @Appendixx I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[8:06:43] bachooga: what my guild does is use the notes addon to keep track of bag group mates and allows our guild to blacklist them. Not perfect but kind of neat work around for the social aspect of it
[8:06:45] mavericks312: ppl need to give up on this whole make wrath sociable when its was the start of the casualization
[8:06:46] Nixis: They should bring LFG back in the game.  In this time where people don’t like to wait so long. And people won’t be as they used to be I mean like when joining a dungeon nobody talks nowadays
[8:07:11] Eredestra: @mavericks312 A Freaking Men!  AMEN!
[8:07:14] Zomgboy: might be a vendor bot thing if you go downstairs ?? idk been ages

[8:07:54] Moobot: @elkaro_ WOTLK Classic ELVUI: https://www.tukui.org/classic-wotlk-addons.php?id=2 |WOTLK Classic Questie: https://github.com/Questie/Questie/archive/refs/heads/wotlk-support.zip |Luxthos WOTLK WA: https://www.luxthos.com/category/weakauras-wrath-of-the-lich-king/ TBC Classic UI: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25206-TowellieesTBCClassicElvUICompilation169.html
[8:07:58] mavericks312: there trying to turn wrath in vanilla and its gonna come back to bite them
[8:08:17] SinicalDev: just allow formed groups to TP in
[8:08:34] itzmeleeo: !wotlk
[8:08:34] Moobot: @itzmeleeo I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[8:08:35] TheGiant99: I'll just stick to retail. Retail is so much of a better experience
[8:08:44] forrestimel: why not give a unique teleport or portal access to those who have completed the dungeons on heroic?
[8:08:44] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[8:08:48] Nixis: They need to accept that the social days are over for dungeons with randoms
[8:08:55] Eredestra: ^
[8:08:57] GalcianBTH: my guess is we have dung finder by Uld
[8:08:58] SinicalDev: i think they dont want LFD for Classic+ plans so they dont wanna add it
[8:09:13] Plague_GG: plague_seraph subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 80 months! 
[8:09:22] Sollice: Classic such a waste of resources
[8:09:28] Sollice: JAB was right..You think you do but you dont
[8:09:38] gritbarontv: true
[8:09:48] mozavich: @Sollice what resources? the dragonflight team isn't the same team as classic
[8:09:59] dannsilveira: heroic is retail mythic
[8:10:06] dannsilveira: is ok to have a daily logout
[8:10:08] Sollice: @Sollice Soooooo if there was no classic...where do you think those people would be?
[8:10:21] mavericks312: @dannsilveira wrong wrath heroics are like retail normals
[8:10:23] Moobot: LooMitt, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[8:10:23] gritbarontv: in another game
[8:10:33] gritbarontv: FF14 promotes that too
[8:10:34] dannsilveira: @mavericks312 tell me more
[8:10:43] Eredestra: 10 people LUL
[8:10:46] TheGiant99: @sollice you are so right. there was zero need for classic why waste the resources
[8:10:47] Subjektive: i thought they built a team for classic and took no one off the main team
[8:10:58] Eredestra: People Dragonflight is what is taking all the work and energy of Blizzard
[8:10:59] Sollice: @Towelliee Thats 10 people who could be working on...something I dunno
[8:11:01] mavericks312: @dannsilveira wrath heroics are piss easy mythic+ takes coordnation and are actually challenging
[8:11:09] Nixis: What if they remove the dungeon finder for wow dragonflight.
[8:11:24] soge131: They took about 1 hour of Ion's time KEKWDISCO
[8:11:26] abracka_: wasn't classic carrying wow during SL though?
[8:11:28] Eredestra: No one is gonna play WOTLK seriously when Dragonflight releases, just sayin
[8:11:31] runotentertaine: Classic is there for a reason. To make easy money.   More like  classic cash grab
[8:11:35] Subjektive: classic may have gotten us real talents back in DF
[8:11:36] Aspectt10: @Towelliee And what are their plans for Wrath after ICC?
[8:11:36] SinicalDev: m+ in WOTLK would be cool
[8:11:38] mavericks312: those 10 ppl could be a quality of life team for retail lol
[8:11:39] JQ47: totally pulled me back in
[8:11:41] tdad2010: the pacing on wrath is so much better than classic
[8:11:43] TheGiant99: @nixis there is zero chance of that happening
[8:12:13] amg1ne: what addon is that xp bar?
[8:12:14] Nixis: @runotentertaine how do they make more money from it. People that play classic already plays retail
[8:12:18] amg1ne: !ui

[8:12:21] Zomgboy: @Towelliee can you check if there's a vendor if you walk downstairs? some said they were there right? I have no clue
[8:12:23] dewking93: last rites
[8:12:23] mavericks312: there is a reason why wrath was the most played xpac
[8:12:26] Sollice: Classic Classic I could see, but classic on following expansions just I dunno. Not for me :) Could be for lots of other people
[8:12:31] Eredestra: Wrath has that old school vibe and feel, but its more forgiving and you can survive Solo :)
[8:12:34] BlewGamingGroup: yea . ring was the only quest i needed help with while leveling on beta
[8:12:37] enux337: nagrand quests
[8:12:42] SoulToned: to say no one will play classic while df is out is ignorant lol. plenty of ppl play both and plenty of ppl wont like df or just prefer to relive wrath
[8:12:48] AudioJaq: @mavericks312 It wasnt LFD lol
[8:12:55] abracka_: truthfully i wish they would have just done vanilla classic, then gone into classic+ taking the OSRS route almost
[8:13:11] cinnamints: IMO that small dev team size is why there's not going to be LFD until it was added to retail back then. They don't have the time/resources to make it work before it was implemented.
[8:13:16] mavericks312: @AudioJaq it was because of how casual the xpac was and LFD was part of it
[8:13:23] dewking93: yet they say it was the beginning of the end
[8:13:31] Nathaniat: !wotlk
[8:13:31] Moobot: @Resent1 I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[8:13:35] gutzkun: I dont know what we talking about but I agree
[8:13:46] gritbarontv: yup, still here :)
[8:13:47] Peirsz: Started in BC, missed WOTLK and then absolutely sold my soul in Cata. Im excited for WOTLK this time around
[8:13:51] enux337: we came back for round 2
[8:13:53] ObamaEnvy: amyec3Raveart
[8:13:56] Kulture1: @cinnamints no
[8:13:57] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[8:14:01] AudioJaq: @mavericks312 Sort of- but it ended up being a detractor to the game in the long run- I know its hard to see past the moment but thats what this is about
[8:14:02] Peirsz: That was when I found your videos too haha
[8:14:03] Sollice: And someone said Classic may have helped putting talents back in DG which may be true to a degree, but the talent system has sucked ass for the past 3 expansions so they really needed to do something big
[8:14:14] Subjektive: you level so fast on fresh you cant get the gold by 20 for the mount lol
[8:14:15] Peirsz: Good ol TGN
[8:14:29] raynestormfur: @Sollice atleast in DF we get REAL talent trees back
[8:14:33] ArcaneSyntax: you do get a free mount
[8:14:34] Surpriize: you do its 32s
[8:14:35] Nerendis: its like 31s
[8:14:38] mavericks312: @AudioJaq making the game more casual is the best thing they could have done, vanilla style game wouldnt be as successful today
[8:14:40] spundancekid808: 33 silver
[8:14:41] SlashSlashy: its 33s
[8:14:46] Mistrfurious: you do and its cheap
[8:14:51] Shamwise: Wish i had that much...
[8:14:52] Timothious: its like 10 g aint it
[8:14:53] Peirsz: Is there something different about the fresh servers other than the fact that it's brand new?
[8:14:55] runotentertaine: Classic relaunches in any game usually  brings in old time players to get that magic feeling again. Guess what you can never relive the past. LUL
[8:14:57] DiiscoViking: you rich biach
[8:14:57] iloveyalunn: Funny, I remember back when WotLK launched everyone was saying it terrible now its the opposite
[8:15:02] Nixis: @raynestormfur  amen for that, but I still miss the old talent system
[8:15:03] Zomgboy: weapon training + concecration
[8:15:04] Rudric_Ice: how much is a normal mount ?
[8:15:11] Collected1: does WOTLK still need the dungeon quest for the warlock epic mount
[8:15:15] dannsilveira: @mavericks312 difficult is not what I or towe were talking about, gear was
[8:15:21] DiiscoViking: with my whole 7 silver LUL
[8:15:22] Zomgboy: normal training is 1g and a mount 70s or something like that
[8:15:23] jasonbriggs: dont spend it all at once
[8:15:25] AudioJaq: @mavericks312 The casual style is right there for ya in retail
[8:15:27] raynestormfur: @Nixis as a "wrath baby" i agree haha i still love those talent trees
[8:15:31] mavericks312: @iloveyalunn candies hated it but now the love it for content
[8:15:33] soge131: And then, dragons KEKW
[8:15:37] Kulture1: nax
[8:15:40] Subjektive: naxx 25 was so undertuned
[8:15:43] MaccoyX: Do Paladins get the lvl 40 Mount from the trainer?
[8:15:53] iloveyalunn: @mavericks312 candies?
[8:15:57] Kulture1: ulduar was so good
[8:16:04] DovahChicken: What made Ulduar so good?
[8:16:10] SSD511_: !server
[8:16:12] mavericks312: @AudioJaq but your missing the point, why make the xpac that started the casual play to be more like vanilla
[8:16:13] sh4d0wsky: towSweat
[8:16:18] mavericks312: @iloveyalunn classic andies
[8:16:19] Sollice: TGC was amazing
[8:16:26] Burnski: Dont forget Ruby Sanctum lol
[8:16:28] iloveyalunn: @mavericks312 oh okay
[8:16:32] Zomgboy: @Towelliee pick up the serpentbloom quest downstairs
[8:16:33] Nixis: @raynestormfur vanillla baby here haha. Yeah the tweaking and mixing was the best. But at the time almost everybody plays the same build haha
[8:16:33] trivotix: I never got to do Naxx in Classic. So, I could not get enough of it in Wrath. I can totally understand why others were underwhelmed though.
[8:16:35] Phil87z: What are the ice fights you liked?
[8:16:44] Herzenliegen: Getting the title Undying was fun Kappa
[8:16:49] soge131: Everyone forgets the random dragon at the end of WolTK LuL
[8:16:55] BlewGamingGroup: alone in the dark  :)
[8:17:04] ItsGigg: Dont forget Onxyia rerelease
[8:17:08] raynestormfur: @Nixis thats why i HATE the current trees..there is nothing new or even halfway exciting like with those old trees
[8:17:08] Zomgboy: yep

[8:37:10] itsChiliiii: Good morning itschi35Vhi
[8:37:48] raldrik: I thought about leveling for wrath but everyone would be done by the time I hit max.
[8:38:25] tyler2tall89: i dont even feel like playing wow right now cause im in talks with blizzard about getting my old vanilla-wotlk account back so i dont even want to farm on my current account thats only 1 month old.

[8:39:29] krellern: bene had a 2 hour queue
[8:39:31] Herzenliegen: The big ques were on the main servers
[8:39:45] Subjektive: 60 on ally side already lol
[8:39:47] GalcianBTH: horde have short AV ques? AV leveling is basically meta atm lol
[8:39:54] GalcianBTH: for alliance that is
[8:39:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, it's possible to fully level about 3 toons before the launch
[8:39:55] queej01: anyone know a good dps mod i can download for my macbook?

[8:40:18] Araphas: will all the servers convert to wrath servers?
[8:40:21] tyler2tall89: starting zones were pretty crazy yesterday
[8:40:27] diaperman42069: wait so are you not able to bring your toon from classic TBC to classic wrath? or are you making a new toon on dedicated wrath server? sorry im confused lol
[8:40:32] tyler2tall89: skyfall the us west pvp server was poppin
[8:40:37] Zivs: yep @Araphas there will be no BC servers, just classic and wotlk
[8:40:39] TheGiant99: @towelliee on retail if you had to choose between a level 50 Druid or Monk which would you level to 60
[8:40:54] Divinder: all TBC classic servers will be going to wrath classic
[8:41:11] Araphas: @Zivs gotcha. so there is no point to create a new character on the fresh servers?
[8:41:21] Minoumi: Have you done the Lost Necklace quest already?
[8:41:33] Timothious: there wasn't folks that wanted to stay on BC?
[8:41:49] CritcobainTV: dudes insane LUL
[8:41:53] Myrre: I thought there were going to split it like they did with classic
[8:42:02] diaperman42069: so how come he is making a new pally? wouldnt he just bring his from TBC?
[8:42:04] Divinder: i mean people probably wanted TBC classic still but blizzard said no
[8:42:06] Phatori: @Timothious Im sure there are but blizz doesnt want to keep classic servers like that
[8:42:06] CritcobainTV: the "race" to 70 dudes like 10-11 levels ahead of everyone
[8:42:11] tyler2tall89: when i first heard of wotlk classic i didnt think they would be adding the exspansion to tbc. I thought it would be its own deal.
[8:42:15] Phatori: they only want to do vanilla classic like that
[8:42:24] tyler2tall89: expansion**
[8:42:34] Zivs: @Araphas I mean the realms will still be fresh you know? Both fresh and old realms will be WOTLK But fresh realms have 100% new leveled characters, no gold inflation etc
[8:42:42] rosina_scarlett: @diaperman42069 bc fresh servers don't have degens that has billions of gold to go into wrath with
[8:43:13] CritcobainTV: Tommy said 70-80 will take sub 10 hours
[8:43:15] Drizz_36: the buff does change things
[8:43:20] badbobarino: as a fellow Bob, I love the name of your toon :)
[8:43:24] CritcobainTV: 20 hours questing if you're fast
[8:43:33] diaperman42069: ahh so the cool kids are going to fresh servers @rosina_scarlett ?
[8:43:41] Aerisot: It will take me 2 weeks haha
[8:43:43] rosina_scarlett: most of them yeah
[8:43:45] CritcobainTV: average person its like 40 hours of leveling i think, but these guys ahve degen strats
[8:43:47] Myrre: unless they nerf the EXP to make it take longer artificially
[8:43:49] Araphas: @Zivs I see. So as a casual, I could just return to play the characters I already have?
[8:43:56] diaperman42069: can sweaty ppl server xfer @rosina_scarlett ?
[8:44:11] Zivs: @Araphas yep exaclty, that's what Im doing.

[9:51:55] Moobot: @Milanesa_De_Pollo I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[9:51:55] SirMouSe: you just dont get it ? but I bet they dont pay you extra when you go over ..
[9:51:57] Grasumiku: thats basing your year of a 40 hr work week for 60 weeks. Lets see who catches on to that

[9:56:36] tattedn3rdd: ive been waiting for my panini redemption for 3 months now...
[9:56:58] Grasumiku: I didn't realize you were a hobby card guy. What do you think about fanatics turning the card world upside down and taking over all sports?

[9:57:53] aladinsane444: I love this song
[9:58:00] JWoody82: yup
[9:58:01] Subjektive: i got so many old cards its insane
[9:58:14] Grasumiku: THey bought the official licensing for the MLB, NFL and NBA
[9:58:19] nitemare34godd: is this song from wow
[9:58:28] Grasumiku: so topps and panini will be un-official licensed
[9:58:29] bruce_almighty: i thought they just bought the "rights".
[9:58:34] BlewGamingGroup: the junk card era
[9:58:36] aladinsane444: @nitemare34godd darkmoon faire carousel song
[9:58:36] Jarlan23: i got some old football cards from the 90s but i dont think theyre worth anything
[9:58:37] Grasumiku: making the value less if it reflects todays prices
[9:58:41] Subjektive: i might cause i got kobe bryant rookie cards and a jordan rookie
[9:58:45] the_dock87: @towelliee I’m still upset that I had a 1st edition charizard when I was like 13 years old lol.
[9:58:45] nitemare34godd: @aladinsane444 cool thx
[9:58:54] Damuffin14: i have so many un opened box sets from different years
[9:58:56] martialbeest: Heya @Towelliee what is the average leveling time for 1-70?
[9:59:08] JWoody82: fanatics bought topps
[9:59:16] Damuffin14: they are taking over what topps did
[9:59:20] binkz77: fanatics is taking over topps products
[9:59:34] 5ixer: Alpha just went down, are we expecting a build today?
[9:59:34] Damuffin14: but im pretty sure MLB had some stake in tops no?
[9:59:35] Grasumiku: they didn't buy topps they got the license from the mlb, nfl and nba
[9:59:41] JWoody82: so seems likely that they will continue making the topps products using their licenses, and panini will either also get bought or have to make unlicensed stuff like their current mlb product
[9:59:56] organicmolecules: prlly end up selling all the rare cards at a huge markup so they can capture more of the secondary market
[10:00:08] PanoramicPanda: i wish the wow tcg was still around
