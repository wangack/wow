[0:07:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: We love leakers!
[0:09:43] Kavieonn: @MetalJoshP Just got news Star Citizen is not releasing next year
[0:14:11] jkitchin75: @Kavieonn lol
[0:14:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Next expansion - Rise of the Murlocs
[0:14:40] jkitchin75: @wEiRdO_dUdE and there plable
[0:14:48] jkitchin75: playable
[0:19:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: We want a tinker class with a tank spec, too
[0:21:38] Venusto1se: The leak is that the next class will be Plumbers to help stop leaks and data miners. Players have to quest to locate random 1’s and 0’s to prevent them reaching wowhead
[0:23:36] Nebulizer87: Next xpac: Voidtrail
[0:23:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some leakers are saying player housing in 11.0
[0:26:12] Venusto1se: I don’t see the point of player housing, even in other games it offers pretty much nothing. Garrison was decent enough.
[0:26:13] dracullus: imagine potential of 'leak' season when you can have it done in 5 seconds throught chat GPT xD
[0:26:36] Venusto1se: XD
[0:27:50] Venusto1se: DF seems to be leaning towards order vs void, so I am going with Army of Light, anduin returns, valens prophesy comes true.
[0:28:31] Venusto1se: But I think it’s going to be about buffering the war, keeping the balance
[0:28:48] Venusto1se: But with Plumbers
[0:30:23] th30dor: sirs, where wayfinder stream?
[0:32:19] Nebulizer87: @th30dor sir Wayfinder died already
[0:32:28] Nebulizer87: j/k
[0:32:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: That chatGPT thing might make it harder to recognize the made-up leaks, true
[0:34:01] h0wler89: Truth, but gotta take any rumours or leaks with a grain of salt regardless
[0:34:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wayfinder is tomorrow!
[0:35:09] geokouts: funny enough i found out that i have beacon on my hunter (chmapion tier 4/8)

[0:50:06] WundertueteGER: wasn’t there some guy who predicted all expansion since 8.0?
[0:50:10] WundertueteGER: 10.0 and 11.0 correspond to the dragon line and element line of CTM, and the history of dragons and element lords will end.
[0:50:14] mavericks312: when you guys leak=problems, when they leak=advertising
[0:50:27] Milanesa_De_Pollo: no, it was from a Chinese site
[0:50:31] Thoreya: wasnt it the asian guy
[0:50:40] Thoreya: not 4chan
[0:50:42] xziyn: A Chinese guy predicted everything since like Cata or some shit AFAIK
[0:50:46] Crowargus: dont they put items in the last patch ptr that kinda gives it away aswell like armor etc?
[0:50:59] Kavieonn: Random question? you guys gaming on Oled? wondering how good it looks and burn in problems?
[0:51:13] Thoreya: he predicted shadowlands too
[0:51:29] Milanesa_De_Pollo: he predicted BFA SL and DF, and maybe 11.0
[0:51:35] Milanesa_De_Pollo: and the 2 expansion after

[1:20:25] Bayne77: Warrior support spec.  Key abilities:  Back Pat, Affirmations, Lets Cry Together
[1:20:27] mavericks312: i cant wait for AC mirage and sm 2
[1:20:51] Ealdfox: @Bayne77 Yup, the Moral Support spec Kappa
[1:21:39] schusta234: need a barfd

[1:21:42] PigPenLen: Lets cry together LUL
[1:21:44] Ch0p_Su3y: they should make disc priest a healer support spec
[1:21:46] schusta234: bard*
[1:21:57] Flebboo: Based on feedback i doubt Augvoker will still be support by next xpac LUL
[1:22:03] KralYoshii: @Towelliee when are we going to see you play league of legends?
[1:22:14] Bayne77: no no, i like that, make a barfd spec LUL
[1:22:17] schusta234: someone running around with a guitar during a fight lul
[1:22:21] jkitchin75: we need murlocks end of
[1:22:22] celic298: We need tinker
[1:22:28] randsam2002: @Towelliee make the survival hunter a support spec
[1:22:29] Ch0p_Su3y: tinker: tank, healer, support
[1:22:35] celic298: We need Tinkers that open warm holes to the void in the light
[1:22:35] abracka_: remodel survival hunters to a tank spec
[1:22:40] celic298: Worm”
[1:22:51] medanmarko: More support classes lead to the game being balanced around it. Take Lineage 2 for example. The content is designed around you being buffed by X classes + self buffs.
[1:23:05] Wcvechten: instead of support specs, add extra tank specs for some classes like shaman
[1:23:11] Ealdfox: Nah, leave disc alone, make a new one holy-based. Now you would have shadow and holy to dps
[1:23:18] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Would be cool if they add underground zones in 11.0 now that they have the tech for it
[1:23:23] Ch0p_Su3y: 6-m dg setup, with support role spot?
[1:23:25] celic298: Tinker support
[1:23:26] PumpkinTME: Disc priest and holy Pally both could be supports in my opinion
[1:23:29] baaronthemonk: I could see them changing aug to tank
[1:23:48] buriedLede: they've killed specs before, combat, gladiator, etc.
[1:23:50] raye_gaming22: yea bing back MOP WOS disc

[1:33:07] ItsNobbie: the new expansion is void
[1:33:08] Scusio: mage support spec

[1:33:24] raldrik: hot take 5th druid spec
[1:33:29] Ch0p_Su3y: possible supports imo:  disc priest, survival hunter, enhance shaman
[1:33:33] Sielu11628: The dark irons will revive our fire lord, Ragnaros!

[1:34:24] HeavyMetta: Voidknight
[1:34:24] celic298: Who remembers Murmur from BC
[1:34:38] falldrgn: by that token.. means we can banish them...sooo wtf we doing
[1:34:39] celic298: Murmur is currently the strongest elemental in game
[1:34:52] Ealdfox: World of Warcraft: Ragnaros, Third Time's the Charm
[1:35:00] Sollice: You could see all of the elemental lords coming back to fight the old golds
[1:35:06] Sollice: That would be kind of cool
[1:35:32] sgtswoll: I don’t think they will turn current specs into support. It would be dangerous to take a spec people love like enhancement and make it support instead of the dps role that people currently know and love.
[1:35:34] celic298: Murmur needs to come bac if we have a elemental xpac
[1:36:06] Rudric_Ice: im more leaning into a time wimey expansion let yrel come back with her light fanatics
[1:36:09] Ealdfox: Void-infused Iridikron trying to take over the elementals, we'll have a version of shadowflame for every element towTinfoil
[1:36:13] celic298: murmur lore was under rated also The destroyer of worlds just with sound like when he went into the area things were just being ripped apart stronger than any elemental no one in the game
[1:36:49] ArcaneMaki: But this this, it's personal..
[1:36:54] ArcaneMaki: time*
[1:36:57] LeXieSterling: Fight battle it all rinse and repeat

[1:58:00] Nebulizer87: all my friends that were bad at retail thrive in classic if you know what i mean
[1:58:16] Prevention6: Im surprised they are releasing another gw2 expansion so soon , I think there was 5 years between the 2nd and 3rd one
[1:58:53] Nebulizer87: @Prevention6 they are changing the way they do things so you'll see smaller more frequent xpacs
[1:58:57] Nebulizer87: better revenue model
[1:58:59] Rafaelfrost_: what is more worth trying, GW2 or NW ?
[1:59:21] Prevention6: @nebulizer87 oh ok that makes sense

[2:03:13] jamarky23: whats the best in your oppinion?
[2:03:32] Rudric_Ice: hows the combat in gw2 ? is it responsive ?
[2:03:47] KralYoshii: @Towelliee when are we going to see you play league of legends?
[2:03:47] Brodih_: havent played gw2 in over 10 years, did they fix the dungeons, they were very janky back then?
[2:04:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: GW2 is great if you want your bags filled with a bunch of junk, kind of a hassle
[2:04:31] Mecabeast: I've been playing some ff14 recently can def say combat felt slower prior to hitting 50 compared to wow
[2:04:37] WestonTeli: i just got in, did you go over the 11.0 leaks yet?
[2:04:54] jamarky23: @Brodih_ Well its called fractals now and they are alot better imo, some still have some jank but its good 80 % of the time
[2:05:03] Rudric_Ice: @wEiRdO_dUdE so like wow ?
[2:05:52] Rudric_Ice: woah was chromie having a seziure or something lmao ?
[2:06:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's about 10x worse than WoW....it's harder to get bag space in GW2 and they give things you can't use like black lion chests
[2:06:07] Prevention6: I think most mmos tend to fill your bags with junk lol
[2:06:09] Balistika89: Is that a WA showing the Morchies big?
[2:06:17] Brodih_: ok good, thx @jamarky23

[2:10:55] Lievy: GW is far better
[2:10:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: One other thing that drove me nuts in GW2 is that you use your gathering tools every time you collect a node....so you need like 100 pickaxes
[2:11:17] Knocx: then EOD, and the new expac launches next week
[2:11:27] Prevention6: the fishing in Gw2 is more fun then wow to me cause you get a boat
[2:11:45] Nebulizer87: most fully featured mmo imo it has everything
[2:11:46] Prevention6: wow should give us boats
[2:11:48] Strouss: thats what screwd me for GW2, i had boosts from being away for years i came back used the boosts then i couldnt figure out what to do, everything i did was missing something. i needed to restart one toon to really do anything lol. Not GW2's fault but i made me stop playing. Otherwise amazing game.
[2:11:48] Lievy: yep it was a lot better than shadowlands.
[2:11:59] bypized: Their marketing is just ass

[2:14:06] belfastcl: gw2 was initially designed with the hopes of having an esport scene around it, but that plan flopped very early

[3:18:56] Rudric_Ice: classic+ good cata classic bad
[3:19:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: They keep sending out Classic Cataclysm surveys, to a limited degree
[3:20:06] Cody_Cayde: Need wrath plus.  Branch off in a different direction
[3:20:21] Niksen_99: What is your top 3 favourite tank specs and you cant choose prot paladin :D
[3:20:29] onous_: Just got straight to mop classic.
[3:20:32] Eviltuna13: Wanna label fast in Cata classic do the water starting zone. You will have the whole zone to yourself cohh1Guy
[3:20:51] Eviltuna13: Level*
[3:21:19] asmodai4823: first raids and dungeons were great in cata
[3:21:24] Calphurnious: Don't nerf the dungeons like last time
[3:21:35] asmodai4823: yea prenerf dungeons would be good
[3:21:52] Mecabeast: Can't wait for transmog in classic
[3:22:01] Eviltuna13: Cata wasn’t that bad just spine sucked
[3:22:07] Echosapian: probably the most comprehensive UI i've seen on DF so far
[3:22:11] celic298: Cata was fun 1st tier cuz of 3 raids
[3:22:23] Nerendis: What about a leak did I miss?
[3:22:30] Echosapian: easy to read/understand
[3:22:32] Rudric_Ice: @asmodai4823 so u want cata to die faster lol ? people already stopped playing ulduar bcuz its hard
[3:22:37] TheItalianStallion321: you want to see complicated? go see Sco's UI 6 years ago
[3:22:38] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:22:42] TheItalianStallion321: BlasON's UI is atrocious
[3:22:49] asmodai4823: @asmodai4823 it is...?
[3:22:50] luckfore: its not as clean as it was back in the day but still clean enough
[3:23:03] flookguy: I keep going back on forth if I should use elvui but idk if I wanna spend so much time fixing the UI on all my toons
[3:23:12] TheItalianStallion321: old Sco was atrocious as well
[3:23:21] abracka_: i don't know how the fuck sco did world firsts with that UI
[3:23:23] Rudric_Ice: @asmodai4823 yes
[3:23:25] Nerendis: Oh god, OG Sco was unwatchable exclusively because of his ui
[3:23:25] TheItalianStallion321: you literally see the middle of your screen which is 10% of the monitor
[3:23:26] Niksen_99: Everyone said WOTLK Classic will be the best game ever. Now everyone is saying Cataclysm Classic will be bad.. I think it will be awesome then
[3:23:26] Calphurnious: @Rudric_Ice The dungeons weren't even hard to do pre nerf
[3:23:41] xd_pad: @flookguy you can set up a profile that can be shared by all of your characters. Set it up once and use it for everyone
[3:24:05] vak_hunt: did i get jebaited on the 11.0 expac leak season begins or is there something that leaked?
[3:24:15] khrovaa: @flookguy just use towelliees package lol
[3:24:28] cipusanx: yea, like no dungeon finder
[3:24:28] flookguy: @xd_pad yeah but even that overwhelms me haha
[3:24:36] cipusanx: genius devs
[3:24:38] Nerendis: I alternatively hate the zero bar ui that a lot of RFW raiders have these days. Basically just a Luxthos WA and that's it @Towelliee
[3:24:42] celic298: Wrath was a major success but right after Nax it died
[3:24:43] Eviltuna13: No dungeon finder put a lot of people off
[3:24:44] koctopus: the 11 hour server queues killed a lot of people off to
[3:24:48] flookguy: @khrovaa is towels free
[3:24:53] khrovaa: ye
[3:24:59] asmodai4823: tbc > wrath
[3:25:00] love_eggplant: if it had dungeon finder i woulda played
[3:25:08] vak_hunt: no dungeon finder was a stupid idea
[3:25:13] TheItalianStallion321: cant call Wrath a major success if it died after the 1st raid
[3:25:15] onous_: The release timing wasn't great either.
[3:25:15] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee We will get Classic but with no RDF because #reasons
[3:25:17] CultistSam: both tbc and wotlk classic have no where near as successful as vanilla, if they do classic+ it will most likely be from the first version its the most unique
[3:25:28] Echosapian: it's really fun
[3:25:33] DunzoCD: hardcore is the true evolution of classic
[3:25:33] koctopus: You gonna play wow HC?
[3:25:34] Niksen_99: Everyone think WOTLK is popular because of their numbers... But people dont realize WOTLK is very alt friendly. People raid on 10-15 alts every week
[3:25:37] TheItalianStallion321: a major success is continued success, not 2 months
[3:25:42] Wcvechten: I just hate everything being GDKP lmao
[3:25:44] Rudric_Ice: @Calphurnious the people who play classic will definitely hate it
[3:25:55] Corwex: it sure will drive up viewer numbers on twitch
[3:25:59] love_eggplant: i dont think so
[3:26:03] love_eggplant: barely see anyone talking about hc
[3:26:05] cipusanx: imagine fucking the success of wotlk...the most popular expansion of all time...this hard
[3:26:07] raldrik: the spawn tagging is going to be the real boss
[3:26:11] bambooooh: Huh, we got news about 11.0?
[3:26:14] Rudric_Ice: oh yes it will
[3:26:15] rhodistar: Is Classic cata confirmed?
[3:26:18] Calphurnious: @Rudric_Ice Why?
[3:26:18] raldrik: good luck if you dont have an instacast
[3:26:18] Nerendis: @love_eggplant omegalul?
[3:26:23] Mecabeast: Debating between human warrior or orc warrior for hardcore
[3:26:26] Eviltuna13: I got off on the 28 so I can sit in the human starting zone and watch the chaos cohhBoom
[3:26:35] Nokterian: Mugatu - 'Playing hardcore is so hot right now'
[3:26:36] Echosapian: making a fan favorited mod official is big W by blizzard
[3:26:47] Havenmess: Isn't there already classic servers? What is different?
[3:26:59] flookguy: @towelliee new merch idea: towelliee diner coffee mugs. I need a good coffee mug
[3:27:14] alatryste: !wayfinder
[3:27:29] Prevention6: some of the ai voice overs on that addon sound so goofy lol
[3:27:32] Heero_Effect: Idk I think hardcore will be okay, it’s nothing to get me to sub back to the game until 10.2
[3:27:34] jkitchin75: @Havenmess you die you delete and start over
[3:27:34] TheItalianStallion321: !wayfinder is delayed. BOOM
[3:27:42] TheItalianStallion321: supposedly Wayfinder is on Target with tomorrow

[3:28:40] Rudric_Ice: @Calphurnious bcuz people prefer easy stuff thats why u will see more people playing classic than wrath classic cuz classic is just simply easier than wrath
[3:28:40] TheItalianStallion321: but on point for tomorrow, SO FAR
[3:28:46] Nebulizer87: was a crossplay issue i believe
[3:28:52] TheItalianStallion321: @Heero_Effect lol ironically no

[3:29:08] Sielu11628: Steam is on schedule for tomorrow. PS is in air still
[3:29:15] TheItalianStallion321: a crossplay issue, althoughk playstation has not confirmed a release date for Wayfinder. so that boggles my mind
[3:29:18] Heero_Effect: Confirmed WoW dead, Towellie won’t play anymore after today accoKEKW

[3:40:55] TheItalianStallion321: Ashes has 1 dev working on the game. thats why its going to take 10 years
[3:40:58] The_Dane_Train: @getitonthelow try Classic WoW and don’t raid. I got burnt out playing retail and enjoying just simple leveling when I have time. Feels like a world not just a patch.

[3:44:04] TheItalianStallion321: someone in this chat weeks ago came in with that bombshell and confused the fuck out of the whole chat
[3:44:23] Nerendis: @ArcaneSyntax The riot mmo 100% will release.
[3:44:24] LandonKyle: @ArcaneSyntax the riot mmo is 100% gonna release
[3:44:25] zysmos: are we talking about new world ? Kappa
[3:44:28] Nokterian: you need a quantum pc from nasa to play it
[3:44:31] TheItalianStallion321: 4090, low settings Roblox MMO
[3:44:33] asmodai4823: if it plays on consoles you wont need that great of a pc

[3:45:25] herzlustafir: is it a smaller or bigger patch thats next are they slowing down?
[3:45:41] mavericks312: other devs are gonna steal the mechanics they wanted to use well before that game goes into beta at this point
[3:46:00] TheItalianStallion321: OH Towel, chat. Equalizer 3 is coming out. new trailer. IM so excited
[3:46:02] Rudric_Ice: when was the last time u ate a big mac ? tow

[3:48:40] m4owl: like  New world that game took like six years to come out and look at it now
[3:48:40] mavericks312: at this point if ashes does launch its gonna be DoA
[3:48:42] Nerzalus: ashes will kill wow Kappa
[3:48:51] ArcaneSyntax: the swtor problem, people wanted good wowclones when it started, by the time it came out no one wanted it
[3:49:06] GodKingMuninn: like every korean MMORPG does the node system lol
[3:49:16] Sollice: I still maintain AoC is just a tech demo and they are looking to sell to a company
[3:49:18] LandonKyle: im not impressed with the combat system in ashes so far
[3:49:32] Rudric_Ice: u can kill a piglet and make bacon out of it looks pretty good lirikTEN
[3:49:41] Nebulizer87: ashes combat is same as ESO lol
[3:49:44] JRobezzz: @Sollice I can believe that. I'm convinced the game never launches lol
[3:49:45] mavericks312: @Sollice i mean i could see that tbh and hope to get a big offer for it
[3:49:50] m4owl: lol
[3:50:10] AngryBeastMan: Player driven towns and rules/laws/economy is going to be terrible. It may be cool to see or do at first, but eventually it's just going to get annoying. Dealing with real people is the worst lol
[3:50:15] Malitor: so tired of game announcements then they take over 6 years to come out (if ever)
[3:50:26] sm0keo: the archer stuff seemed cool
[3:50:29] TheItalianStallion321: like New World
[3:50:32] TheItalianStallion321: with the taxes
[3:50:59] raldrik: thats like believing that people wouldnt grief in New World. You would think they would learn from Amazons mistake
[3:51:03] DunzoCD: that gets so toxic
[3:51:10] TheGiant99: The way players are now I wouldn't release anything till it was ready to come out.
[3:51:24] dracullus: nothing beats Bethesda with TES 6 'trailer' in 2018 xD @Malitor
[3:52:15] Malitor: @dracullus and Metroid Prime 4 lol
[3:52:18] AngryBeastMan: Can you imagine the poor clueless new player that just happens to fall under Asmon's feualism? Oh lawd help me
[3:52:32] m4owl: ashes is doing that?
[3:52:33] Rudric_Ice: subbing in 2023 DansGame
[3:52:48] zysmos: They had a developer update were like they showed physics upgrade for mining rocks and it's like.. so many resources in to something that doesn't matter as much
[3:52:49] Kavalesca: By time ashes launches subscription models will probably not be a thing anymore
[3:52:51] TheGiant99: I mean it's not worth going through and listening to all the negativity
[3:52:55] DunzoCD: runescape too
[3:52:55] raldrik: I bet they think their hype reach is much further than it actually is
[3:52:59] mavericks312: unless your a big name brand that shit isnt gonna work
[3:53:01] Elrab: Gonna follow te same footsteps as Wildstar with that sub model
[3:53:06] manmower: i think ashes needs to put in a lot more work on the combat
[3:53:21] WestonTeli: i mean, if they do even as good as guild wars they'll be fine
[3:53:33] EfnetLemons: wildstar sub Kappa
[3:53:41] WestonTeli: hell, swtor is still up
[3:53:50] Malitor: my impression of Ashes: They are putting so much polish on the "not important" things
[3:53:57] Dallywacker: what is this?
[3:54:06] dracullus: so.. TESO?

[3:55:38] DunzoCD: WoW on gamepass would be very Pog but i dont think they will ever do it
[3:55:56] Nebulizer87: ow2 is doing well if u look at player count

[4:00:27] Rudric_Ice: @Niksen_99 its harder than classic fo sho
[4:00:32] Nerendis: @Niksen_99 I think it's easier personally. Threat essentially doesn't exist. Just gotta keep your active defensives rolling.
[4:00:42] TheItalianStallion321: @Niksen_99 depends. end game content, it can be. casual stuff, not so much
[4:00:46] Mecabeast: Google is updating their inactivity to 2 years before they delete an account

[4:02:48] Molvonos: @Nerendis nope
[4:03:00] Molvonos: Two orbs spawn the entire fight
[4:03:26] Rudric_Ice: do those other dragons do anything or just cosmetic ?
[4:03:40] Molvonos: Otherwise you'd be able to ignore the mechanic and you know Blizz hates that, lol
[4:03:47] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice They give buffs
[4:03:55] Nerendis: Where does the second one spawn?
[4:04:14] Rudric_Ice: ahh
[4:04:17] JRobezzz: @Nerendis typically targets 2 ranged players
[4:04:20] Molvonos: @Nerendis Under another player.  Orbs always spawn under two players.  One moves, the other soaks.  I was on soak duty until the shaman goofed.
[4:04:33] spansonite1: towBeer

[4:05:26] Nerendis: @Molvonos Right, that's my point. If there isn't another player, where does it spawn
[4:05:38] herzlustafir: for real?
[4:05:42] Molvonos: @Nerendis Both under the same player, but slightly spaced apart
[4:05:44] Niksen_99: What a chad towel is soloing the boss
[4:05:55] Nerendis: @Molvonos Annoying
[4:05:58] spansonite1: man that color scheme is sooo cool!
[4:06:38] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos BG3 is chill

[4:18:07] Molvonos: I'd like to see one Action/RPG game where the 'main character' was insignificant.
[4:18:16] WestonTeli: i mean, our boss kills have been stolen over and over lol
[4:18:29] Molvonos: People saying stupid shit like that for years, but could never name a game where you were 'insignificant'.
[4:18:49] Rudric_Ice: @mavericks312 hope so
[4:19:00] Molvonos: I mean, you're the 'Warrior of Light', so yea.
[4:19:01] solomobs: thats what ff14 did great u were the main character
[4:19:04] belfastcl: @Molvonos most characters start insignificant, its part of character development
[4:19:06] gingerbasterd: Thats because Square knows how to write a story
[4:19:09] MykeCA: Even Swtor does that well
[4:19:34] Molvonos: @belfastcl That does not, in any way, answer my question.  In WoW, you start 'insignificant' and through questing/storylines, become more.
[4:19:34] Jango_: Runescape

[4:24:40] Jango_: '23 was one of the best years for gamers in recent history
[4:24:43] Antdavs24: starfield is definitely going to be a hit the mark or stumble
[4:24:44] mavericks312: alot of great games this year but a zelda game did release this year
[4:25:01] gingerbasterd: BG3 is amazing. It is already the highest rated game of any platform for all time

[4:27:34] Mecabeast: D4 had an amazing launch
[4:27:40] Heero_Effect: D4 nah, it may get nominated,  but it won’t win

[4:37:09] ashwing_: People love Larian as a studio
[4:37:12] asmodai4823: how is it overhyped lol
[4:37:12] Kakotan2143: @mavericks312 i agree
[4:37:13] abracka_: it's not overhyped lol
[4:37:14] kokochris: its also because the game came out working well with minimal breaking bugs
[4:37:21] TheMysticBean: BG3 is a decent game. But the finished product should be the standard for all games.
[4:37:25] carnage889: do you think console gamers will get frustrated with BG3?
[4:37:34] Jango_: its not overhyped it was good

[4:37:51] Heero_Effect: It’s best game I’ve played in years
[4:37:52] Ealdfox: The game was in early access for so long, it better be bug light
[4:38:00] Jarlan23: @carnage889 the console ui looks horrible i was watching another streamer play it with a controller
[4:38:06] mavericks312: FF 16 launched with no bugs spider man 2 is gonna luanch most likely with no bugs
[4:38:10] Masqerader: Didn't Larin have the game in early access for 3 years at full price before release?
[4:38:13] Jarlan23: controllers dont work when you got 30 skills
[4:38:20] kokochris: but thats a good thing, their process worked
[4:38:26] orempov: @Masqerader yep
[4:38:28] Ocenus: I think this year there have been a ton of great games that have come out, it will be close but I still think bg3 might take it imo

[4:39:00] Jango_: i really want starfield to be good, please be good
[4:39:04] xziyn: What's special about BG3 is the amount of content really
[4:39:08] mavericks312: because ppl are just meat riding bg3 right now
[4:39:09] gingerbasterd: I dont thing BG3 is going to do well on console but I feel like it doesnt NEED a console release
[4:39:18] dannyis1337: Zelda totk winning goty
[4:39:19] asmodai4823: bg3 isnt hyped just because of no microtransactions
[4:39:21] TheMysticBean: @Jango_ Same but Bethesda dont have the best rep for game launches lmao
[4:39:25] ShakyShade: because they don't have so much in it as Bg3
[4:39:25] Kyle2k06: think its mainly cause divinity 2 did so well
[4:39:29] thatguynamedjans: What other games though? I legit cant think of any in recent memory that launched at 60$ with no bugs, had 100+hour campaigns, and had no microstransactions
[4:39:30] xd_pad: @Masqerader worth it. Covid also happened. Presales are common practice, and those games you cant even play until it launches
[4:39:48] Sollice: Elden Ring is the only game that comes to mind for me @JansPlaysGames
