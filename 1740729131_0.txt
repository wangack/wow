[1:25:58] beerking2323: Villanin at this point they prolly have a slew of options to choose from when modeling a boss

[1:26:41] homewrecker101: havent been in a guild since legion   Kappa
[1:27:00] VillainSR: @beerking2323 Yeah I guess the designers signal that they want a multi boss encounter for instance and the modellers/lore guys come up with it from there
[1:27:14] citrinesoan: yea legion was the best! but i am about to buy dragonflight i am so excited!!
[1:27:53] beerking2323: would be interesting to see there Project Timeline/Milestones

[2:17:28] WeedFranck: storm is made for alt
[2:17:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Warrior just doesn't have the raw healing output that prot paladin or bears have, which was a big factor for me
[2:17:38] Subbed_No_Ban: @gamingdad77 any gas fireplace? so cozy raxxCozy
[2:17:38] abracka_: got two meal plans with that everyplate link, super excited
[2:17:42] ArcaneMaki: Does storms still require full support of 4 portal by different players? (probably one of the worst design they did in a long time)

[2:17:56] JimKappa420: @towelliee this chest from storm can drop sparks ?

[2:30:10] PokerFaceMoose: @Mecabeast i do not know the voracity of those claims, and if true they would be unrelated. a small number of farmers that raise a very small number of chickens is not going to affect the egg market. but the millions of hen laying eggs culled from large farms would.

[3:15:23] Shrenko: yeah screw horde races and citiies
[3:15:24] Exodeo_: i'd lov e cross faction guilds
[3:15:29] Squirrel_nutty: "no i will not go with you, i would like to keep this conversation in public!"
[3:15:50] Shrenko: @Exodeo_ its coming
[3:15:59] GingerGambit: How would cross fraction hall of fame work then?
[3:16:09] Sollice: They would get rid of it lol
[3:16:12] Squirrel_nutty: my hands are above my head, notice there up high
[3:16:22] xo_navi: yeah i bet that security is on LOCK
[3:16:23] Sollice: Why do you need hall of fame anyways
[3:16:28] SSD511_: Trap
[3:16:35] Raxxiety: carry around consent forms and a go pro
[3:16:51] tumb_tack: Faction Fluid
[3:16:52] xo_navi: they would merge hall of fame prob
[3:17:00] Squirrel_nutty: go full PC princable

[3:17:37] kaeildk: @Towelliee will you then identify yourself as Alorde or Halliance?
[3:17:37] Sollice: You dont need Hall of Fame...It serves as a function to allow opening of mythic to cross faction. if you want a Hall of Fame give the first 100 to mythic clear a title
[3:17:50] xo_navi: i want to play alliance but you can't if you want to play the game lol

[3:18:06] Snabido: Dork iron or normie dork we talking?
[3:18:11] Exodeo_: I'd go dwarf just to play the race too tbh, it's amazing
[3:18:12] tocu: Couldnt we aleady say that about Echo and Limit while they couldnt have both in the guild but had both in the raid and on the team (them just being a guild)
[3:18:18] Kelticlore: how is Dark Iron for tanking
[3:18:21] Dropzone34: I would be dwarf on 3 of the 5 characters just for stoneform alone
[3:18:39] Prevention6: I love dwarfs
[3:18:48] xo_navi: @tocu yeah but they can't literally be in the guild yet
[3:19:01] nc716: does lula do m+ with u at all?
[3:19:13] Sollice: Faction stuff is dumb anyways at this point. I don't mind it but Katie hates playing Horde because you have to be "ugly" races for Druids. Let her play her damn night elf lol. Cosmetics are a big part of MMOs
[3:19:17] xo_navi: although they might as well be at this point.. i want to say i raided with an alliance in mythic vault
[3:19:29] xo_navi: but maybe it was heroic i forget
[3:19:40] Weezil_: Weezil_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 85 months!

[3:20:50] Allvarez: everyone can zug zug
[3:20:51] Exodeo_: I raid x-realm with an alliance guild as horde lol
[3:20:54] Kelticlore: I feel Faction Pride died when Metzan left
[3:20:59] xo_navi: the only negative is that back in my day
[3:21:06] iNeF_: For the Tanks !!
[3:21:08] Allvarez: i just want to play a void elf as horde
[3:21:09] tocu: I blame blood elves racial back in the day for faction pride mattering the gap getting to 66/33 enough for people to care more about game play than the faction
[3:21:13] Davedaman26: FOR THE COOKIES
[3:21:37] Sollice: I think there are much bigger stories at this point and baddies out there than horde or alliance. We have been there and done that
[3:21:47] iDeez88: I was a Dwarf when DKs first came out, then they removed dwarf bleed removal....rip
[3:21:52] Sollice: we are at the point where we have planetary fights
[3:22:02] GingerGambit: This boss isnt bad anymore
[3:22:23] Foretoldlegends: @Sollice Honestly. I think Greymane might be the next leader to start an Alliance vs Horde war. It just screams him doing that.
[3:22:29] xo_navi: yea it was overtuned af before
[3:22:33] tocu: @Sollice how many exspansions in a row have they ended on horde and alliance come together to take out a greater evil ? it maybe all of them.

[3:24:00] thetruegodofwarr: its so disheartening when people instant leave keys
[3:24:06] Sollice: @Sollice I dunno. With Sylv being gone I dont know that it makes much sense
[3:24:15] GingerGambit: Fair
[3:24:18] Foretoldlegends: @Sollice They have "come" together but not fully. It wasn't until Shadowlands they've truly come together to face these evils. But visit previous expansions, Horde FP will still attack you.
[3:24:23] xo_navi: yeah as long as they aren't assholes who cares honestly

[3:26:24] WytChapp: I ram a black temple this morning finding out about the timewalking dungeon shit was dope low key
[3:26:27] Mecabeast: mm hunters need to realize they were probably only brought to lust
[3:26:47] j_bar111: @Towelliee what addon to you use for trasmog roulette?
[3:26:59] watchthemgrow: im a mm and i only join groups woth

[3:29:17] homewrecker101: dont have any goals
[3:29:22] Foretoldlegends: @Anubyss88 There's a talent that gives them a damage increase for having no pet out. But honestly, if they buffed the damage buff from the stat, the talent would feel more worthwhile.
[3:29:40] xo_navi: i'm super casual but i always end up grinding a bit of gear. i enjoy wow from that perspective the most.
[3:30:05] xo_navi: i wish you could pug mythic raid earlier tho i don't want to be tied to a group
[3:30:16] WytChapp: @cherryilla Thatâs how Iâve been but Iâve been trying to head to at least try a heroic raid once
[3:30:32] GingerGambit: Isnât the key ruby? Whereâs he flying to XD
[3:30:35] Sollice: Yeah Lone Wolf is weird
[3:30:35] homewrecker101: theres only me in my guild so i get whatever i get xD
[3:30:54] Sollice: Seems like a dumb talent node to be honest. MM are always solo unless your needing to solo and need a pet tank
[3:31:02] iDeez88: @Foretoldlegends i know about the talent, but "Lust" is sitting in storage, its a dumb concept
[3:31:05] xo_navi: yeah i did 4/8 mythic this tier and 2400 io but i get tired of the grind
[3:31:10] CEK_kingdom: @GingerGambit hes ready for season 2 brakenhide already lmao
[3:31:11] Sollice: Buff MM by 10% and pick a better choice node
[3:31:52] cefeon: cefeon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:32:07] iDeez88: Just give every class a lust
[3:32:10] iDeez88: its 2023
[3:32:26] xo_navi: asking hunters to play the game correctly kek
[3:32:32] Sollice: meh...Lust is a boring spell or talent choice. Give MM something different
[3:32:33] Loewanbrau: put drums back to 25% and we're good
[3:32:43] Snabido: Drums need a job too FeelsBadMan
[3:32:52] xo_navi: yeah idk why they took away the battle scrolls either
[3:32:58] xo_navi: the buff scrolls were dope

[3:33:02] coldarmorTBG: or it least give them an ability like warlocks Grimoire of Sacrifice.
[3:33:02] Sollice: Yeah drums would be better
[3:33:02] Foretoldlegends: Honestly. I think there's a strat to call the pet out to lust, and then dismiss it after lust is called.
[3:33:19] Sollice: @Foretoldlegends ? Thats what you do its not a strat lol
[3:33:23] PvtHudson093: cant believe people complained about scrolls
[3:33:27] Sollice: Thats what any MM hunter should be doing if they need to list
[3:33:28] Kelticlore: they may not want to tick off the tank LOL
[3:33:29] iDeez88: its still a 5-10 second dps loss for the hunter
[3:33:29] Sollice: lust
[3:33:33] Needdaann: @Carahail Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:33:43] Frekkis: To dissmiss a pet takes time and u need to stand still

[3:35:23] Snabido: Making it sound like it takes 5 minutes to lust and do your opener ð
[3:35:30] Sollice: So I mean sure reduce the dismiss to 1.5 seconds would be cool

[3:39:55] jdubz26: well ya
[3:40:03] jdubz26: lol
[3:40:04] DWIGGHT: @jdubz26 it is actually but in the movie is exaggerated
[3:40:06] xo_navi: gotta make it interesting
[3:40:07] GingerGambit: Minus murder
[3:40:09] Sollice: Is that Ray Liotas last acting job?

[3:59:20] Nokterian: Paper Mache Priest LUL
[3:59:25] Hebrewish012: that 418 juiced
[3:59:38] TakeThatBack: just got a spark now I need 3 more concentrates
[3:59:49] Cacos: how do you get the concentrated stuff?
[3:59:51] CEK_kingdom: i bet they dont PW sheild themself or use desperate prayer

[4:00:46] reggiepowa: do they even matter in pvp, pvp ilvl is always the same
[4:00:47] Hebrewish012: 2/10 after 500 lol
[4:00:49] LoseAlotLuke: pvp OMEGALUL
[4:00:57] TakeThatBack: whats pvp
[4:01:00] Hebrewish012: i do 10 16s and peace out never time it
[4:01:02] Snabido: Here you thought PvE had it bad huh KEKW
[4:01:08] Dcarter: p OMEGALUL vp
[4:01:09] Hebrewish012: punish the pvpers
[4:01:10] reggiepowa: these things only affect pve
[4:01:13] SSD511_: Yikes
[4:01:16] Provision_: just an oversight LUL
[4:01:17] izzlarn65: only 2000 more rounds to go
[4:01:20] ajsleeper2: and solo shuffle can take 30 mins to queue
[4:01:22] Rastaballin: it only drops above 2400 rating also
[4:01:24] invictus_DK: They getting owned
[4:01:32] Kelticlore: no real people care bout PVP
[4:01:34] LoseAlotLuke: its nearly as crazy as the priest doing 1.3 million damage across the whole dungeon
[4:01:36] imTymp: PvE > OMEGALUL v OMEGALUL
[4:01:37] Nokterian: wtf
[4:01:39] Hebrewish012: imagine solo shuffling to 2400
[4:01:39] kappaday23: LUL
[4:01:40] abracka_: bruh
[4:01:40] Hebrewish012: lol
[4:01:41] Nokterian: WHY
[4:01:49] TheCJrose1234: I dont think I could get 2400 if i tried
[4:01:50] notdustinx: Lmaoooo

[4:01:54] Nokterian: BREEH
[4:01:55] ç¡è·æç£: damn, thats so mean
[4:01:57] ContraRob: 16s are hard for a lot of players, but not as hard as getting 2400
[4:01:57] reggiepowa: so do 16s if you want pve gear, pvp ilvl is always the same on crafted pvp gear
[4:02:01] Recruitie: tbf, 418 gear is just worse than most pvp gear anyways. Shit scales over 421
[4:02:01] Nokterian: towTinfoil
[4:02:02] notdustinx: 2400 in threes is rank 1
[4:02:13] Korupcija_: good thing is that they don't need them for pvp
[4:02:18] Hebrewish012: 2400 near impossible compared to doing a 16

[4:36:10] Inthezonewow: The mobs being added is just to bring back old transmog that literally no one has
[4:36:12] 91Niki: @Jindo_ZG You sure it isn't just graphical upgrade to mobs already there ?

[4:36:46] Wcvechten: was*
[4:36:52] Jindo_ZG: entirely new mobs is what it looks like
[4:36:53] abracka_: it's either going to be for the anniversary event this year, or them being farmable for transmog
[4:36:54] galinhoo: zg m+ dungeon?

[4:46:52] GingerGambit: Never tried either, just thought about it
[4:46:53] Molvonos: @Molvonos I think aschmidt makes the good point.  Your typical mythic raid group is far more organized and consistent than your typical AOTC group.  Less chaos makes for a better raiding environment when you can trust everyone'll be there on the regular.
[4:47:10] galinhoo: the eye of skovald

[5:29:24] Dashuriax3: keep winning
[5:29:24] realtree502: blizz needs to give ECHO 25k to not participate for a yearh
[5:29:26] jdubz26: keep winning cause its free money
[5:29:29] NukTalDir: no one ever stops cause they won to much

[5:29:50] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  warcraft twitch is up
[5:30:03] sentokiisarg87: Thatâs the question. Will they quit. Until that point no one beats them. I say the MDI dies before they quit.
[5:30:04] Orgabism: They're getting paid
[5:30:07] rLeo2: Lets blame Echo for being too good 5Head
[5:30:08] c0mmander_starscream: Blizz needs to pay ECHO "Hookers and Pizza" to sit out for a year.
[5:30:13] snake_like: they're gonna have to turn echo into the gladiator champions. they're always there for show, but everyone else competes against one another
[5:30:14] Foretoldlegends: @lilcobra58 25K is nothing if their jobs are do race mythics like this. You'd need to up it to 250k.
[5:30:17] Odinslayer: did tom brady say am gonna stop winning cause i have 6 rings? no he went and got the 7th
[5:30:18] NukTalDir: but kinda sad no one else has challeneged them
[5:30:58] zhc_: lot of time and effort that a lot of people dont have
[5:30:59] snake_like: :) I don't put in the effort because I don't get a salary to be that good
[5:31:09] Uttaris: EU domination
[5:31:10] c0mmander_starscream: The Colts stopped winning after winining 1 SB
[5:31:16] Shrenko: how much is the price pool ?
[5:31:16] faulen: the Race is at least close. The MDI is comparable to winning by 5 days
[5:31:22] sentokiisarg87: Thatâs what will happen.
[5:31:27] Sollice: I would do it even if you knew you werent going to win. if you are somewhat competitive you basically doing self promotion and thats worth it
[5:31:27] rLeo2: The good ol times when the competition was Method NA vs Method EU
[5:31:40] Rottencoarse: @Shrenko  30k for one cup grand finals is 400k
[5:31:48] shnee__: "Season 1 Global Finals where they will race for their share of $300,000"
[5:31:48] biirrd: 300k for the global event, and 30k per weekend
[5:31:51] stabzmcgeee: already seeing big names pulling out cos its not worth it anymore,, i.e dorki,growl,jdotb etc

[5:33:22] smashwow: tbf the payout for MDI is meh
[5:33:26] smashwow: for what it is
[5:33:28] snake_like: I mean jfc you can still teach someone how to throw a spiral without being an NFL superbowl winner. m+ content creators are fine
[5:33:28] Dashuriax3: how many times in a row did echo win

[5:34:01] yaugerz: 4 or 5

[5:34:10] Gremaldy: not straight
[5:34:14] falldrgn: eco\method.. probably more than that
[5:34:23] c0mmander_starscream: Is Slooty watching the mdi?
[5:34:24] rLeo2: Sadge
[5:34:29] reggiepowa: yeah, echo is winning because they are the best
[5:34:33] smashwow: and then the one time blizz gave the community a way to increase the prize pool, blizz pocketed that shit LUL
[5:34:37] xo_juuzou_ox: Echo won 3 in a row
[5:34:37] rosina_scarlett: Echo have won 3 in a row
[5:34:44] faulen: Meers was always the coach

[5:35:02] Dreepi: Clickz is instead of frag
[5:35:10] smashwow: method pre echo which was echo just by another name @Towelliee
[5:35:17] Quakezilla69: who? lol
[5:35:19] snake_like: blizz wants all this e-sport stuff but won't pay up like riot
[5:35:22] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  meeres was the mdi coach always and they had dlick gingi and frag as dps
[5:35:26] Rottencoarse: naowh as tank

[6:09:28] GingerGambit: Thought stormslash was unique equipped?
[6:09:32] Sollice: What does that mean its not from this season
[6:09:34] Densetsu_: Thats kinda dumb
[6:09:34] c0mmander_starscream: ECHO time traveled to the past to compete in 2023

[6:09:58] ParsingOnProgress: isnt it blizz fault for making it available?
[6:09:58] rosina_scarlett: @Towelliee isn't stormslash unique equip?
[6:09:59] snake_like: it's neltharus m0 gear
[6:10:00] TheGiant99: is that a rule
[6:10:01] abracka_: it's from neltharus
[6:10:01] Hebrewish012: not at that ilvl
[6:10:05] realtree502: the team echo "competed" against should lodge a complaint
[6:10:06] abracka_: which would be s2 m+
[6:10:07] GingerGambit: Double stormslash is also weird
[6:10:15] c0mmander_starscream: this Echo team time traveled from 2032
[6:10:19] tiyanigean: @tiyanigean ohh okay, thats weird. I gues the rules are if its on a tourney realm vendor its fair game?
[6:10:21] coldarmorTBG: How'd he get it?
[6:10:25] Dagomarus: Yeah it should be in next seasons loot pool
[6:10:30] rosina_scarlett: I think so
[6:10:41] Uglyfoot: @GingerGambit Stormslash isnt unique equip
[6:10:51] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee you click the names on that site and see the gear
[6:10:58] snake_like: lmao imagine the attempted backlash "we lost by 5 minutes because of forgestorm moon2A "
[6:11:11] GingerGambit: @uglyfoot it isnât?
[6:11:22] realtree502: Meeix is just <3 <3
[6:11:26] asthelegendgoes: no not unique
[6:11:28] Amerra: What was the final time for echo?
[6:11:32] asthelegendgoes: why would they make a 1h unique?
[6:11:39] captain_khyzan: but that mace would never get to interact with those rings in retail..... thats BS imo
[6:11:41] Uglyfoot: @GingerGambit no, my VDH uses both
[6:11:42] TheGiant99: @towelliee is that a rule
[6:11:48] tiyanigean: @Amerra 12:43
[6:11:50] rosina_scarlett: @Amerra 12:15 or so
[6:11:50] ParsingOnProgress: and scaled up bloody coin gear?
[6:11:53] imTymp: @Amerra 12:43
[6:11:57] UnfraggableKronk: have they said anything as to why they would allow things such as Forgestorm in season1?
[6:12:16] zhc_: play moonkin
[6:12:21] zhc_: lets go naguura come through
[6:12:22] stabzmcgeee: blizz puts the gear on the vendor so eh its allowed
[6:12:23] WeedFranck: pray for echo fail ...
[6:12:36] realtree502: @UnfraggableKronk idk I got it muted, looking at meeix lol
[6:12:47] PvtHudson093: its an M0 weapon but still avialable
[6:12:49] ParsingOnProgress: theres a lot of vers on that scaled bloody coin gear
[6:12:54] Molvonos: Super SAI-JIN.
[6:13:02] Molvonos: Oof, the weeaboos gonna riot
[6:13:06] greentechx: how did he get a forgestorm when you cant run that place in m+ to get a 421?
[6:13:08] imTymp: RLP time
[6:13:08] aero3132: goku yellow hair

[6:13:37] Dagomarus: Its the correct name too meeix with the weebism
[6:13:42] Hebrewish012: imo Echo needs to rerun
[6:13:45] Hebrewish012: with no forgestorm
[6:13:52] Sollice: They arent going to rerun lol
[6:13:56] Hebrewish012: illegal item
[6:14:00] Zansteh: apparently dk's gear is sus as well
[6:14:09] Provision_: @Hebrewish012 why? WoW made it avaible for them
[6:14:12] Hebrewish012: oh really ?
[6:14:13] falldrgn: Blizz knows what gear is on the vendor
[6:14:18] UnfraggableKronk: on the vendor or not I would like to see whats attainable this season. not next. just me though.
[6:14:20] imTymp: even without forgestorm it was a landslide
[6:14:21] TheGiant99: how di you guys know it's illegal
[6:14:22] imTymp: but still
[6:14:25] stabzmcgeee: BLIZZ sets the gear vendors on realm
[6:14:25] realtree502: yes because his weapon is going to slow them down enough for Lucky 7s to get down 2 bosses and mobs
[6:14:28] Hebrewish012: yes it's a huge blizzard fail but it shouldn't be
[6:14:31] Sollice: The gear isnt sus if Blizzard put it there for them. May be weird to us but
[6:14:32] faulen: 11:16
[6:14:35] Provision_: @Hebrewish012 they can only pick items from vendor that blizzard setup...
[6:14:37] LuiBMHunter: 4 minutes
[6:14:39] faulen: 11:16 ó 
[6:14:41] c0mmander_starscream: if the rules say it's not illegal then its legal
[6:14:41] realtree502: 11 i think
[6:14:46] Rottencoarse: 11:!6 @Towelliee
[6:14:56] stabzmcgeee: every team has the same access to the same gear on a vendor

[6:28:58] Ragetiger1: I hate when they do pulls like that in heroic or normal. they don't like to interupt the flame fusion
[6:29:00] Ezekyler: this is a walk in the park for Echo, theydon't pull the boss because they can't

[6:34:00] pilhass10: LUL
[6:34:00] Sollice: So is there a few minutes between next match?
[6:34:00] xHukk: Oh good.  MDI is here.  Now the mythic Plus scene will be trash because every tank will think these pulls are meta.

[6:34:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Many boomkins already rerolled warlock this expansion, it's fine
[6:34:28] iDeez88: that last pull, jesus
[6:34:30] drwatcher: oh boy, RLP are going to rough after this lol
[6:34:32] Molvonos: @Gremaldy Naguura has this unhealthy belief Boomkins should be toptier at all times and compares them to everything.
[6:34:36] iDeez88: they lose no hp
[6:34:38] rosina_scarlett: Blizzard needs to give us a damage breakdown of Naowh...
[6:35:00] mavericks312: wait pallies tank this xpac?
[6:35:01] acebme: Lucky 7 should've been a wild card seed for the semifinals or something. The here balance is silly.
[6:35:03] OnceAMoose: Echo doing Echo things.
[6:35:06] Nokterian: 32k watching on twitch noice
[6:35:21] CeruleanStar: who was using the illegal weapon ? lol
[6:35:36] Azined: @Molvonos true. its because she doesnt have knowledge of any other class
[6:35:43] Gremaldy: @Molvonos Hahaha, I can see that
[6:35:45] CamelStep: Nowa
[6:35:48] Zeke_nl: weekly no leavers vs Echo
[6:35:48] Valearleen: isnt rank 1 tank a paladin?
[6:36:00] CeruleanStar: UHDK is fine
[6:36:05] CeruleanStar: it's fiiiine :D
[6:36:09] rosina_scarlett: @Zeke_nl TRUE
[6:36:20] gidgeet: I wish I could do a mythic dungeon, but my eye hand coordination isn't what it was 4 years ago :(
[6:36:22] REDSUNDERGROUND: PLauge build go brrr
[6:36:24] rosina_scarlett: tbh UDK only shines in HUGE AoE packs
[6:36:26] 91Niki: Same with feral. That's where feral shine too
[6:36:29] CeruleanStar: i wish everyone would hear her words here--- worst thing for me is a tank who pulls 3 mobs :(
[6:36:32] Amerra: wait.. this is weird. They actually made it past the first boss and didn't have a leaver? Weird Kappa
[6:36:42] CamelStep: Buff Unholy DK  ApuApustaja
[6:37:17] rosina_scarlett: Ask Zorbix why a S2 wep is in S1 MDI
[6:37:18] Provision_: @gidgeet well even me as casual can do 10+ keys. Just give it a try with a guild group and have fun!
[6:37:28] c0mmander_starscream: Lucky 7 vs Sloths
[6:37:29] CeruleanStar: we are getting a buff in m+ for 10.0.7 right ? the ST/aoe spec change should mean more dmg in m+
[6:37:32] mcatx2: After MDI Blizzard buffs unholy Dk
[6:37:39] jerseyfive: you also cant have the final for the first match
[6:37:41] zhc_: here we go legion flashbacks
[6:37:46] strike879: echo needs a 10 ilvl penalty to keep it fair to the other teams
[6:37:52] duffluv22: Sooooo....feral huh???
[6:37:59] Densetsu_: Top teams in the world, "shitty" Kappa
[6:38:02] IchigoKisu: Discord didnât even notify me you were live :(
[6:38:05] rosina_scarlett: Zorbix could def say what the gearing rules where
[6:38:09] faulen: This one could me much closer
[6:38:10] MrAshHill: Echo should just automatically go to the finale
[6:38:10] CeruleanStar: yeah having byes would have been better imo
[6:38:13] gidgeet: @Provision_ I don't have a guild on my server, but I could find one for beginners ;)
[6:38:13] mcatx2: MDI really can show which classes are OP and which ones aren't even close
[6:38:19] TheGiant99: It's how tournaments work @towelliee
[6:38:20] CeruleanStar: so like a 10 or 14 team
[6:38:26] mcatx2: These teams aren't going to use the lol spec
[6:38:32] zhc_: eventually the end outcome should be the same anyway in theory
[6:38:40] stabzmcgeee: @rosina_scarlett the gearing rules are whatever blizz puts on the vendor
[6:38:51] Provision_: @strike879 10? LUL  He was doing 23's on his VDH at ilvl 395 ilvl LUL
[6:38:55] Gremaldy: I agree, the top 2 seeded teams should get a b+
[6:38:56] faulen: Time Trail time: https://twitter.com/meeix_/status/1626596159300186112/photo/1
[6:39:03] flebbooo: mw monk for sure Kappa
[6:39:13] TheGiant99: nfl no.2 seed plays no.7 seed
[6:39:17] Hebrewish012: frost and unholy dk in same team ?
[6:39:20] Hebrewish012: that's just madness
[6:39:22] SmallzzIV: duh @Towelliee yOu KnOW nOthiNG aBoUT TouRnaMeNTs....
[6:39:23] Gremaldy: I agree, the top 2 seeded teams should get a bi-week and auto entered into 1/4 finals
[6:39:34] rosina_scarlett: @rosina_scarlett I get that but i wanna know why they put a S2 wep in for S1 LUL forgestorm is going to be BiS for FDK, Prot war and Prot Pal
[6:39:38] Draggore: well we already saw a VDH so lets see what we see next
[6:39:46] Sarcastard: UDK,Rogue, Boomchicken
[6:39:47] faulen: wonder if Meeix plays a DH Kappa
[6:40:03] CamelStep: Not Really @mcatx2 it gose also with the setup for example unholy dk will just shine in big pulls
[6:40:10] smashwow: giving r1 and r2 a bi = giving them more time to practice
[6:40:13] rosina_scarlett: the only team to ever have a change against Echo was Honestly and Perplexed
[6:40:15] ContraRob: isn't it just based on the time trials? they didn't choose echo to face them
[6:40:17] smashwow: so they're damned either way
[6:40:17] c0mmander_starscream: Trial by burning fire
[6:40:19] c0mmander_starscream: Jets
[6:40:22] c0mmander_starscream: no?
[6:40:22] Draggore: yup
[6:40:26] Theduskflyer: The lions lol
[6:40:27] faulen: jags i think
[6:40:29] Gremaldy: That's exactly why the NFL DOESN'T do it this way
[6:40:32] Thegreatcornholyio: jags
[6:40:32] SmallzzIV: jags
[6:40:35] freakwidit: getting soft in your old age lol
[6:40:36] ContraRob: high seed plays low seed in every tournament, except when there are byes
[6:40:36] TheGiant99: so the no2 seed played the worst
[6:40:37] bigstick258: jags won their division it wasnt them
[6:40:40] SmallzzIV: lions nfc
[6:40:41] Thegreatcornholyio: jags had 7th seed
[6:40:56] Thoreya: LUL
[6:40:57] Lobby_WoW: jags almost beat the chiefs too from mahomes injury
[6:40:59] Draggore: jags were the 7th placed seed.
[6:41:02] Glhfunyuns: jags won afc south
[6:41:09] CustomGraphix: its like Mayweather vs jake paul LUL
[6:41:15] smashwow: the problem is blizzard isn't making it worth it to get new blood in the game.
[6:41:16] mcatx2: Watching Echo is like watching the Golden State warriors when Kevin Durant was on the team
[6:41:24] smashwow: the time v money isn't worth.
[6:41:28] Asyia3: jags won south and lost to chiefs before playoffs

[6:41:51] bigstick258: chargers  maybe
[6:41:56] sentokiisarg87: What was Meers overall for RLP?
[6:42:02] xHukk: feral druid in the MDI.  Now I've seen it all.
[6:42:04] Thoreya: @JimKappa420 15k on twitch!
[6:42:06] acebme: Texans were the worst in AFC, Bears worst in the NFC
[6:42:06] Thoreya: mdi is killing it
[6:42:20] bigstick258: dolphins were 7th
[6:42:26] smashwow: @xHukk feral was in MDI in legion. it's been a minute but it's good to see again
[6:42:39] Gremaldy: @xHukk Better watch what you sayl... there's a Niki91 about....
[6:42:40] rosina_scarlett: MDI was the best thing Blizz did in Legion
[6:42:41] Glhfunyuns: and dolphins almost beat bills despite being on their 3rd string
[6:42:42] PvtHudson093: needs a drop to get more in
[6:42:42] Hebrewish012: literally keys > everything else
[6:42:50] Hebrewish012: you raid to compliment your keys
[6:42:58] Thoreya: keys than shuffle. thats df rn
[6:43:02] rosina_scarlett: speaking of.. GZ on 8/8M!
[6:43:15] c0mmander_starscream: sadge
[6:43:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Raz is history
[6:43:22] drwatcher: Blizzard really need to up their raid game
[6:43:29] faulen: the raids should get harder each week! now that would be content
[6:43:30] Thoreya: wish there was AP kinda. dont yell at me
[6:43:52] brighadoon: What can Blizzard do to make raiding as rewarding as m+?
[6:43:53] Cian161: !drops
[6:44:04] mcatx2: Blizzard should have never made it where M+ and Raiding go hand and hand. M + gear should only be used for M+ and Raiding gear for raids.  They should be separated. Also, tier gear from the last boss shouldn't be in the vault until that boss is killed
[6:44:14] drwatcher: What if they added affixes to raids every week?
[6:44:30] acebme: I'm 397 and not even in a raiding/M+ gulid
[6:44:40] iDeez88: start with Echo, now everyone looks slow
[6:44:41] ContraRob: @drwatcher they kinda tried that in season 4
[6:44:56] IchigoKisu: Can we gamble dkp on the outcomes
[6:44:59] CeruleanStar: that doesn't sound 'fun'
[6:45:00] brighadoon: @mcatx2 that's a horrible idea imo. I like being able to take rewards from one and use it in another.
[6:45:02] Hyelander_: @mcatx2 That is some L take
[6:45:09] realtree502: bring back meeix

[6:46:28] realtree502: shocked face
[6:46:34] Nokterian: MCFLY!
[6:46:39] Kelticlore: I predict we will see either a Mega Dungeon or a Raid located in the Temporal Conflux section of Thaldraxus
[6:46:41] Molvonos: Just imagine how small the dungeon would be without flying
[6:46:44] JFeezy__: its just doesn't seem like an easy dungeon to just crush super fast
[6:46:47] Molvonos: All that wasted space.
[6:46:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: The problem is that if you give the same gear everywhere, most people will do the easiest thing (like PvP instead of raiding)
[6:46:50] PvtHudson093: When it first came out i wasnt a fan of notgood
[6:46:52] CustomGraphix: so glad they nerfed that npc screaming all the time, best change ever lol
[6:46:53] enux337: Notgud offensive

[6:50:20] acebme: watch 1 team get the Crawth glitch....
[6:50:23] stabzmcgeee: wonder if bird boss can bug out on tourny realm
[6:50:24] PvtHudson093: do you ever do the 2 and 1 orb strat on Birb boss?
[6:50:35] strike879: wonder if they fall trough the bird boss platform
[6:50:47] zeru26: hope it bugs out, so blizz finally fixes it out of embarrassment
[6:50:47] mcatx2: @Hyeland3r I would actually prefer M + to go more the route of rewarding trasnmog over gear. The player base for Wow is getting older and this is changing the landscape. Not everyone is wanting to raid 2-3 days a week + be required to run 8+ M + dungeons a week.  It's really an oversight from Blizzard on why the game as gotten plenty of criticism over the last 5 years
[6:50:52] CustomGraphix: so sick of the bird boss, had an invisible trash add a few times now making the boss not spawn
