[2:07:55] remmixx: as a viewer it was easier tyo tell how the game was going
[2:07:55] Malte_L: I disagree. Ppl say literally every patch that wow was never this bad. When i think of all the main problems ppl complained about in bfa/sl, blizz pretty much fixed the, But ppl always find new thing to hate
[2:07:56] sourbutts: EU is a bit too ZuggZUgg
[2:07:56] Tanlat1: i'd liek to grind solo shuffle but t he queue is so long
[2:07:58] ElendrilEU: dampening meta comps are soo boring to watch
[2:08:01] sh1nebze: Its no where near balanced right now.
[2:08:02] purplereigns: even the games you played on stream last night were fun to watch
[2:08:02] ganaken_: arena incentivizes pve now
[2:08:05] starving8: I liked seeing meele cleaves doing well for a change
[2:08:08] p1perTV: it was fun to watch because there were a lot of close calls to win/lose that made it entertaining
[2:08:08] Feroxita1337: like i said its fun for the casual who has no clue whats going on anyway xD
[2:08:14] StreetBlades: Hey @Whaazz . How do I remove my CDS from Ability Team Tracker? Can't seem to find the option
[2:08:14] hellcryftw: It is always fun when underdog win imo
[2:08:17] exploitivex: @Whaazz whats better atm or more fotm outlaw or dh
[2:08:21] maybethistimepls: this was the most fun awc to watch
[2:08:26] piggiepie: I love tourneys because they last longer
[2:08:29] Lovelesstv: legion tourneys were so much more fun to watch
[2:08:29] bartek8003: still even as a viewer i had few more entertaining ones than the last weekend awc
[2:08:29] MutationsTv: @maybethistimepls weird how every team had a rogue and most teams play rogue mage?
[2:08:32] slickdaddyg69: @sourbutts EU is a bit too zugzug xDDDDDD says the gg and liquid fan
[2:08:38] klkliik: horrible design cc doesnt matter at all
[2:08:39] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Whaazz
[2:08:42] blindsaplol: I think its not that bad cose there are way more variety, RMP isnt meta but yeah dh and ww are something ....
[2:08:42] iamreallyafan: it was so lovely to not watch rmp winning so
[2:08:47] Malte_L: what??? KUK
[2:08:51] fredslfm: he didnt watch
[2:08:52] fredslfm: Awc
[2:08:54] fredslfm: i guess
[2:08:55] whspe: nobody played rogue mage lol
[2:08:59] maybethistimepls: @MutationsTv KEKW
[2:09:00] Akrololz: rog mage so broken.......
[2:09:01] Vendrek: What do you expect when they increase health given from the pvp trinket set bonus
[2:09:02] sourbutts: the move won the last game of the series before blue bar was empty
[2:09:07] whspe: mage is so bad lol
[2:09:08] gregtehcow: late wod and legion tournies were bis
[2:09:08] bokyftw: he didnt watch the same awc for sure
[2:09:14] iamreallyafan: exactly, thats why pvp is good rn
[2:09:15] kelqoo: but according to cdew arcane is the most op thing ever, cdew is never wrong Kappa
[2:09:18] likeapro1337: PLAY DK DH LIKE A BEAST MANM
[2:09:19] ALjalladTv: destro and ele shit so hard on mage
[2:09:20] scurrx: what about shadow priest?
[2:09:56] artagore: what hit me the most is the toxicity on the chat for every game. "Rogue is broken" "rogue tournament" buff this buff that "hope he is loosing" 80% off comment were like that it was hawfull
[2:09:56] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[2:09:59] Malte_L: eogue is much better on higher rating. its always like that when rogue is good
[2:10:00] Bijaqt: Can you show your weakauras now?
[2:10:03] Malte_L: rogue*
[2:10:04] Akrololz: HAHA
[2:10:09] Akrololz: the usual twitter boys bro
[2:10:13] honta14bb: @Whaazz Do you think if you played against Hooli in a frostmge/demo you could win? They are very anti-meelee
[2:10:25] dmason828: if you disagree with the state of the game and how AWC went, what would you do to fix it?
[2:10:30] Akrololz: ye can do only it for the memes
[2:10:43] Akrololz: aka GAIS MY CLASS HAVE A DEBUFF 50% MORE DMG TAKEN BLIZZ FIX
[2:10:49] Akrololz: thank you tony.
[2:10:54] ungodlyxdx: retirement inc
[2:10:55] fredslfm: I need x8 gushing to play arena
[2:10:56] fredslfm: Sadly
[2:11:02] ALjalladTv: True
[2:11:06] OblivTTV: Hoolibang was entertaining af
[2:11:06] goldenpharmy: rogue/ mage was to dominant over decades
[2:11:08] klkliik: pinnacle of dogshitness even compared to shadowlands etc
[2:11:10] amnetv: naa corruption was fun
[2:11:11] klkliik: so bad
[2:11:24] vannenx: REMEMBER DREST AGATH
[2:11:27] diosilvl: 60yo whaazz still playing WoW whaazzLEAVEQ
[2:11:28] bokioz: Do you miss the Shadowlands trinket bomb?
[2:11:32] liquidburst: what need to chang? @Whaazz
[2:11:34] blindsaplol: entertainment = suffering
[2:11:42] moon_ty: nice setups
[2:11:44] amnetv: was fun bc they were the underdogs
[2:11:46] assrug: because they randomly bang someone
[2:11:49] diosilvl: cuz friendship ended echo's dynasty
[2:11:52] amnetv: it was melee RMP
[2:11:59] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Whaazz and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[2:12:06] amnetv: melee fire rmp from SL
[2:12:07] Malte_L: Stop talking or are you trying to get sub nerfed again Kappa
[2:12:11] HellscreamKV: !Shufflespec
[2:12:11] Moobot: @HellscreamKV Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[2:12:20] Supalapahar: @amnetv  buff rogue
[2:12:24] RogueRhezor: they are OTP on this comp they play for years
[2:12:31] iamreallyafan: people just dont wanna see rogue mage
[2:12:33] sourbutts: hoolibang showed what rogue mage looks like, except its a windwalker
[2:12:35] iamreallyafan: people is scarred for life
[2:12:35] Feroxita1337: blizz caters towards the casual player because those are the majority but that leads to skill being less important
[2:12:44] bartek8003: @bokioz resonator? it was super fun. s2 Shackles was fun too
[2:12:49] Supalapahar: @amnetv nerf dk
[2:12:54] strengthofathousndmen: its sub rogue bias, even after eradas does 5 times the damage, people still complained about sub oneshot
[2:12:57] rdubm: nerf frost dk
[2:13:07] blindsaplol: people hate RMP baseline
[2:13:08] gianni_gsp: buff windwalker
[2:13:08] aod0311x: I hate the term "one shot". It's so far removed from its original meaning. No one gets one shot anymore. It takes ten minutes
[2:13:09] egrttv: Because people like to see smth new, not RMP for years
[2:13:11] sourbutts: mage rogue has always looked like that historically, but mage isnt good enough rn
[2:13:15] Milkman3447: buff WW
[2:13:15] fredslfm: Dude I was literally yelling and waking up my gf when u almost got popped in opener
[2:13:20] xhoumr: ppl just wanna see someone else winning than echo.. this is real reason why ppl sayin its fun to watch
[2:13:24] Feroxita1337: make casted cc matter  again...
[2:13:27] antonbreakfast: i don't think people hate rmp i think they just hate your rmp xdd
[2:13:37] Cantbemilked: ww hard to kill now ?
[2:13:43] duckiethotx: @Whaazz do you think any other comp would have been beter against Hoolibang?
[2:13:48] bokioz: Do you feel Raikus class pool is good enough?
[2:13:56] sole2kx: Its fun to see other teams can win aswell
[2:14:05] NlPPEE: vs what comp? just tuned in
[2:14:06] gianni_gsp: @sole2kx i second that
[2:14:13] maybethistimepls: i didnt think any of hoolibangs spec's wouldve been in the finals let alone win. sub hpriest ww no one else even played those specs
[2:14:20] ascherxo: @NlPPEE rlx
[2:14:28] purplereigns: I think people hate RMP becuase they can't play it
[2:14:29] emergence_fi: lol ppl hate rmp 100%
[2:14:36] jerrysp: no thats it
[2:14:39] jerrysp: what you said
[2:14:42] shoe1452: your rmp is the only one i like watching
[2:14:44] honta14bb: rmp just viable so long
[2:14:44] jerrysp: im ok losing to perfect setups
[2:14:53] supatease: I think its always been people dont like invincibility
[2:14:55] RogueRhezor: i hate CC reduction , and new heal trinket , and my 6 sec blind , sap kdny, i hate PVE meta
[2:14:59] sourbutts: yeah you guys control the entire game its fun to watch
[2:14:59] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[2:15:09] jerrysp: but when they fail everything and you just die randomly cause rogue has immortality cds and mage aswell
[2:15:09] Moobot: https://www.twitch.tv/whaazz/clip/JazzyUnusualJalapenoEagleEye-idkWIYFZo54OaUnC
[2:15:16] aktell: I just like seeing classes that aren't usually represented. RMP has been a common occurrence for years. *shrug
[2:15:35] aod0311x: Whaazz, why do ppl say one shot when it takes 5+ minutes to "one shot"?
[2:15:37] bartek8003: well thats the same when dk dh press cds and win without trying, or same was a thing for mage lock in shadowlands
[2:15:38] sourbutts: why not sub with a mage?
[2:15:40] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Whaazz
[2:15:40] wogxwog: How did holy priest make it work? So surprised to see one
[2:16:00] Simbagrove: would frost demo x not just completely destroy the sub ww goes?
[2:16:05] brokolichen: deva would be interesting
[2:16:06] maybethistimepls: ur playing sub from now on?
[2:16:06] gianni_gsp: @wogxwog it's decent post buffs
[2:16:09] brokolichen: doues a lot of damage
[2:16:14] Warzead: can you show your atlent
[2:16:17] Warzead: talent*
[2:16:18] HellscreamKV: catJAM
[2:16:23] dipicat: are you...farming pets? O.o
[2:16:23] sinseh7: ww is basically sub rog on stereoids but without a stun, and sub rog offers that stun to the ww
[2:16:24] honta14bb: watching rmp with all these wild setups on MoP and LK enjoyable af
[2:16:24] blindsaplol: cose mastery of holy prioest is giga broken
[2:16:31] blindsaplol: and cant be purged
[2:16:33] Mooreeze: i don´t think they are so "tanky" it´s more that they have so much pressure that brings enemy teams to play more deffensive
[2:16:37] paxz07: damn u must love ur foot
[2:16:39] paxz07: sweet talking it
[2:16:52] voygard: yea they already have alot of defensive so the priest dont have to heal that much
[2:16:57] EssoNumeroUno: what is good to play with in 3s as arms warrior right now?
[2:17:00] LazyTigertv: show the cat
[2:17:04] goldenpharmy: dont feed her with cake
[2:17:13] Feroxita1337: ye honestly thats the only really impressive thing about hoolibang imo and i mean no offense by that... crazy how jayti managed to heal for that long
[2:17:20] iceskip_wow: @Simbagrove its probably one of the best if not the best answer to it yeah will probably see it next week
[2:17:24] TheRealEKL: how do you feel about dh lock vs outlaw lock?
[2:18:01] iceskip_wow: crazy shit is you even lose the mana game into sub/WW which is kinda stupid coz you neeed to play D all game properly and you dont get any reward from just survivang
[2:18:27] gianni_gsp: @Feroxita1337 howton in particular played INSANE though.
[2:18:54] SusanBoyle03: SusanBoyle03 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 25 month streak! ❤️

[2:19:17] SAMO0RA1: advice for a sub main should i switch to outlaw ?
[2:19:52] honta14bb: they sdn`t add this 6% buff fr
[2:20:04] barapersson: No you misread the tweet, Venruki also says ww does insane dmg but rogue overall is in a much better state as they are in 99% of games lol
[2:20:04] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.

[2:20:09] Vendrek: I have seen combat rogue do 120k dps in shuffle...
[2:20:10] Rewenzz: is it only me or is leather classes way tanker than plate atm?
[2:20:14] ALjalladTv: what made them die is that karma was too weak before they buffed it
[2:20:16] torkija: was watching tyga stream a bit yesterday evening, he went slowly through ur every game vs hooli and pointed out so many mistakes u guys did and I know Tyga talks shit alot but a lot of it seemed so on point
[2:20:16] gianni_gsp: @barapersson @Whaazz
[2:20:17] sourbutts: surely like frost sub hpala would be good into ww rogue priest?
[2:20:35] honta14bb: but we havew 1337 rogues and 1 ww xDDDD
[2:20:59] Rewenzz: have yo seen all the ww-dks on ladder tho honta xd
[2:20:59] bokioz: @torkija Tyga has a big mouth, thats why he and cervantes got in a fight
[2:21:27] gianni_gsp: I love backseat gaming from (relatively) inferior players.
[2:21:38] honta14bb: @Rewenzz awc dude
[2:22:10] Pajcsi: @bokioz true for 95% of the wow pros tho
[2:22:20] torkija: darknesss
[2:22:22] maybethistimepls: whos ur fav cs player? @Whaazz
[2:22:27] mattasaka: Hi Whaazz ! Ty for your streams.  What has been your main team's learning from AWC pliz ? Will we see any changes ?
[2:23:02] emergence_fi: so smooya
[2:23:07] kelqoo: cs2 is fucking shit its sad
[2:23:22] amnetv: cs2 = wow rn
[2:23:27] Ceribi: @torkija tyga was looking at it as if u live u win. but he didn't get they were playing to win the game not to outlive them which was maybe wrong approach but who knows
[2:24:14] Warzead: arcane 140k dps
[2:24:34] kelqoo: @Warzead arcane always does good dmg vs pet classes
[2:24:34] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Whaazz
[2:24:37] amnetv: @Ceribi Tyga saying shit, but if he was there he would`ve died first go vs hooli
[2:24:47] gianni_gsp: @amnetv p much
[2:25:26] torkija: @bokioz ye I know he does but all of it was on point. Stuff like Chan's pointless late ports, chasing behind pillars on nagrand, Chan not trinketing chastise to shadowfury bomb in which Whaazz died, using infernal on CD instead to stop go's etc

[2:25:42] Moobot: Don't forget to follow my Twitter to see when I go live! https://twitter.com/Whaazz
[2:25:48] HellscreamKV: is that Shattered build you're playing?
[2:25:54] Milkman3447: DH not broken at all
[2:26:01] liakos03: dh dmg is stupid op
[2:26:30] buffevoker: So they can beat u playing sloppy
[2:26:31] Ceribi: jayyti didn't play fade
[2:26:56] Raikubest: dont think he could play fade
[2:27:01] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz he called out Chan on so many bad ports and coils
[2:27:16] rhauru: nah chan did amazing
[2:27:16] kelqoo: he played double dispell to cuck chans immolate i think
[2:27:50] sammers21: he played double dispell to dispall immolates or smth
[2:28:04] DIABLISTx: @Whaazz you got World of meleeCraft. simple as that :P
[2:28:21] asdkl2312k3o: @sammers21 would u win awc with eredas and howton?
[2:28:24] Rewenzz: didnt he have the fade animation at one point where chan landed a fear? think it was @supatease who pointed out it seemed like he faded but might be wrong
[2:28:31] Lord_SanTinaX: !addons
[2:29:10] subtlety59: even scratched his nose in the middle of that lol
[2:29:16] kruzefix: hey what do u think of WPS or WLS rn?
[2:29:22] sammers21: @asdkl2312k3o Huh
[2:29:28] Raikubest: he didnt play proc havoc..
[2:29:29] Raikubest: fk me
[2:29:30] FoxiekittenWoW: @Rewenzz you have fade as a spell always, but if you dont have the pvp talent it does nothing besides reducing 10% dmg. he didn´t play the pvp talent
[2:29:51] twinbladeuk: @Raikubest where/when?
[2:29:57] Rewenzz: yeah my bad, knew about the baseline fade @FoxiekittenWoW but wasnt sure if it was a different animation on the pvp talent or not
[2:30:03] sammers21: @asdkl2312k3o let me put it in a different way: Howton is the only rogue that can make the comp work
[2:30:13] gianni_gsp: @sammers21 yuuuup
[2:30:16] amnetv: is funny how people say tyga said this, but the guy never played any tourney
[2:30:20] sammers21: and he can make it work with any priest and ww
[2:30:31] Nextrkw: stop @sammers21

[2:30:53] graundingg: Shush
[2:30:54] FoxiekittenWoW: @amnetv you dont need to play tournaments to analyze the game?
[2:30:56] Ceribi: ww and sub both unkillable

[2:31:22] diskmachin1: do it
[2:31:27] diskmachin1: fun to watch
[2:31:31] sammers21: i mean obviously jayti played good, he figured out the build that allows him to not cast
[2:31:39] gianni_gsp: @bellens07 howton aids'd them and monk lives reasonably well if played correctly.
[2:31:47] blackvpnv: let analyse one game could be fun
[2:31:49] sammers21: but if they would have any other rogue they would not make it

[2:32:10] Smil3s_: @whaazz can you tell us a little bit about your process after the games? it seems like you were a little bit annoyed of some of your decisions (just from your camera view)
[2:32:10] DIABLISTx: @Whaazz you guys played wonderful , its just melee power ^^ hard to outplay
[2:32:21] torkija: Think it would be very fruitful to watch Tyga's stream from yesterday, he was actually pretty thoroughful, like he was ur coach or smtng. Just ignore occasional flames :D
[2:32:27] Milkman3447: pikabooInsane pikabooInsane pikabooInsane
[2:32:35] mattasaka: As a multi-champ and after awc, what is ur mood/spirit for next months ?
[2:32:38] gianni_gsp: @sammers21 I think there's a handful of other rogue who, too, could make it work.
[2:32:47] uninspire: IDK everyone says outlaw is this easy apparently
[2:32:55] RogueRhezor: katevoRave
[2:33:02] sammers21: @gianni_gsp no, even with whaazz they would not
[2:33:22] sammers21: unless whaazz practice that comp for like 3 monthes
[2:33:53] gianni_gsp: @sammers21 so your'e saying people like whaazz and kalvish can not compete with howton mechanically?
[2:33:54] DIABLISTx: @Whaazz i agree 100%
[2:34:03] RogueRhezor: why u hold to much ur trinket on the big opener on u whit gouge smoke on opener ? vs all cds
[2:34:12] zyforleaf: i mean if they buff cc how are classes with no cc gonna do anything?
[2:34:12] Lord_SanTinaX: !addon
[2:34:16] scribzww: @gianni_gsp Whaazz yes, kalvish by far no where near whaazz and howton mechanically XD
[2:34:22] gorilla_ape: your mad cuz lost and there is a new better team then you
[2:34:24] Ceribi: outlaw needs nelf
[2:34:38] dusttiy: @gorilla_ape ur name matches bro
[2:34:50] rockxtv: jayti had a great breakdown on stream of the games. He showed how his positioning was preventing follow up cc. thought it was really interesting
[2:35:03] amnetv: tyga rogue would`ve won if he played with chan and lontar 100% Kappa
[2:35:15] scribzww: Kappa
[2:35:18] harmfulzz: @Whaazz hi i am sam, i been a garbage collector for about 20 years of my life untill i finally got retired. never in my wildest dreams did i think that i'd get to watch so much trash again until i started watching ur stream <3 pure nostalgia

[2:41:54] scribzww: If CC was how it was before it would jsut be rogue mage every game again how would you beat?
[2:41:57] iamreallyafan: the cc changes is so good for casual players so
[2:41:57] DSay987: dh needs buff
[2:42:00] unluckythen: imagine if sub could 8 sec blind into sap into 7 sec kidney o ntrinket
[2:42:01] Malte_L: @Cantbemilked Mop Pog
[2:42:04] unluckythen: with the current damage

[2:42:15] psychic241: 4 people rosters supposed to guard against any particular meta tho, no?
[2:42:21] liquidburst: @Whaazz what changes do u wanna see/make to make it better?
[2:42:22] Rewenzz: cant really just balance the game around 1 player being insanely good at his class tho. DH rn is ultra easy for a decent player. alot of it is the damage but also the glimpse etc
[2:42:25] Injekce: tbh u cant balance class tha easily..cause their whole design is made more for pve..most of the classes should have different spells for pvp
[2:42:26] meexz_: !addons

[2:44:45] mufaasa_fr: whaz do not know who faker is haha
[2:44:59] Fynlol: its kinda deep if wow is your job basicly
[2:45:16] schnitzelram: Do u think cata classic will be better than retail?
[2:45:19] Malte_L: DED YEP
[2:45:23] AFTERxMATH: how does this not get exhausting, explaining your thoughts to people who wanna slam you on what ever you say, its mega sadge

[2:45:50] graundingg: last 3 xpacs its bad
[2:45:55] grris: Thats how elo systems work you need higher winrate than 50/50 to climb the higher u get
[2:45:56] hazexd: i think wow is the best game ever made
[2:45:56] manobi235: What is the fun about it that Whazz possible die in the first second of the game because classes so unbalanced?? You know WHazz best mechanical player world and whre is the skill about this shit
[2:46:09] sleepzqt: what would happen if wow gets free to play?
[2:46:25] Zevx: west coast NA gets 170 to europe KEKW
[2:46:27] dusttiy: stop have best seed then
[2:46:29] kreyzy8: west coast NA to EU is like 200 ping lol
[2:46:32] OuJi_TV: What does legacy mean if game have  such a high entry level that you  guys play same poeple for 10 years xD lets be hones  if  the gamee was easly accessable and pvp was more accessible nobody  would be on top for  10+ years  xD
[2:46:33] Scroep11: And because of not being able to play on their main, many other rank 1 players like yourself are playing on "alts" and gate-keep the game further. Of course it's their right to play but blizzard should  repair the problem at the core @Whaazz
[2:46:34] Malte_L: Im playing since cata and cant remember a single expansion where ppl didnt complain about the current game idk. I think the game was way worse in like bfa/wod
[2:46:40] pantsupics: are they retarded?
[2:46:40] strengthofathousndmen: you won like that against kawhi tho
[2:46:47] strengthofathousndmen: in outlaw rmp sl ssn4

[2:46:52] shoe1452: they should definitely be flying people out with some of that prize pool
[2:46:52] DSay987: @sleepzqt very good question
[2:46:54] ghanih: Why would it not be in east coast? there it should be less than 180
[2:47:03] itsQQgaming: so what

[2:48:01] dusttiy: he cleared the history guys
[2:48:03] dusttiy: KappaPride
[2:48:05] liakos03: @and1spirit Faker made SKT famous
[2:48:25] Zevx: having NA vs EU for the big money in a non-lan environment is pretty braindead
[2:48:28] sarent02: faker is kinda mid
[2:48:29] innovaheal: i believe so too @dusttiy XD
[2:48:30] whspe: kAPPA

[2:48:47] Raskopp: I just want a glad mount for soloshuffle (maybe recolor idk)
[2:48:55] kevinsorbo1337: well the part about accessibility is def true. nobody gets nowadays into a game where you need to read 100+ hours of guides. its lit sad that you cant even play the base game. u NEED adddons to be able to play. what is this
[2:48:58] stepkoudny: is ww omega s tier?

[2:49:04] strengthofathousndmen: play pres instead
[2:49:08] sind233: if you wanna make pvp more about CC then you gotta balance it and give everyone the same amount of CC, unlike now where some specs barely have CC while rogues can CC you all game
[2:49:11] 0xaxzy: i rerolled healer for that reason
[2:49:12] Malte_L: KEKW
[2:49:14] lmaoerss: @strengthofathousndmen KEKW
[2:49:18] jacklgrey: @xarotic they don’t show up on lan. just online. the guy said outlier though not onliner
[2:49:20] SaltyBites: when will you become better than pikaboo at 1.6k 2s?
[2:49:26] rdubm: thats why i started playing hpal and i actually enjoy it
[2:49:26] Nextrkw: @scarymonsterinthewoods but is it new blood tho? isnt it just players that play for years and finally make it to the pro lvl after years of prac?
[2:49:27] strengthofathousndmen: i just wanna see you rage at someone lining your communion
[2:49:27] simstarx: 5 gifted for blood dk lets go
[2:49:28] Loadedmvp: disc priest would be maybe more fun for you to heal
[2:49:28] Xarotic: @jacklgrey makes sense ty
[2:49:37] itssadm: Say how much youre making a month from playing wow
[2:49:38] hazexd: there are the only players in top for 10 years cuz if u wanna be good u need to play with good people and vs good people many of u don`t have the oportunity to play with a good team mate and thats why is hard to improve
[2:49:42] scarymonsterinthewoods: @Nextrkw a lot of the new blood are 18-19 year olds
[2:49:42] jacklgrey: :)
[2:49:45] iamreallyafan: @whazz what classes u have to play for the 5gifted thingy
[2:49:52] Nextrkw: @scarymonsterinthewoods that play since theyre 13
[2:49:55] maybethistimepls: u q'd as dps
[2:50:01] noobspreder: every class is unique, that's why everybody has multiple cc's, walls, mobility and selfheal LUL
[2:50:06] guccish0t: @OuJi_TV Thats why pvp in wow such an unpopular, cuz there is no point for new ppl tryhard
[2:50:07] sarent02: wdym more cc?
[2:50:19] Rewenzz: @Nextrkw if i remember correctly you can as a new player IN THEORY make it to fpl and get noticed. its kinda like wow ladder tho, but i think for cs its just better made so to speak. dunno tho
[2:50:27] FoxiekittenWoW: right now outlaw has insane cc no?
[2:50:31] strengthofathousndmen: that makes perfect sense if you have win condition at all. because as sub you can barely 100-0 the squishiest targets with blades up, while they`re staying afk
[2:50:31] lakils: like share the same DRs ?
[2:50:35] Glotai: every class just got same buttons and everything

[2:50:48] Esotraz: fuck mages gut this class i cba
[2:50:48] rdubm: naah even more micro dogshit cc xD
[2:50:49] bartek8003: if we have burst dmg profile we need more ccs, if our dmg profile is consistant pressure you cant have many ccs
[2:50:50] Tibag_thepriest: the damage is too high
[2:50:51] brezkovtv: games are so slow at the moment
[2:50:53] scarymonsterinthewoods: @Rewenzz yeah you can definitely grind solo q and get into fpl and then get noticed a lot of the pro players in the scene now did that
[2:50:53] Zevx: true lets make mages not just be a pve class in modern wow
[2:50:54] bokyftw: cdr
[2:50:55] realglazed: @Whaazz did you happen to check your email
