[0:00:40] Moobot: @alaricyeager Towelliee is playing on Wild Growth server for World of Warcaft: Season of Discovery |
[0:02:56] metavahn231: gotta get in there and discover your runes
[0:03:07] metavahn231: season of discovers baby
[0:08:42] dwsunshine: !lurk  dwsunsLove  dwsunsLove  dwsunsLove
[0:11:40] mmrghost7: its crazy how blizz encrypted this so ppl are forced to find them
[0:12:03] Zettabyte: G'mornin' towHAMUP
[0:12:14] metavahn231: devs finally doing something about datamining sounds good to me
[0:12:59] mmrghost7: the whole warlock community is scrathing thier head for that meta :D
[0:13:19] mmrghost7: scratching *
[0:13:46] magenof: datamining is a blight for mmos
[0:16:44] Ribbwich: i mean is it? That takes away agency of people who engage in the things sites like wowhead put out.
[0:17:48] magenof: ruining the mysteries of the game
[0:17:52] Ribbwich: Information doesn't sound like a blight on anything
[0:18:07] Ribbwich: nahh dawg people be ruining that shit for themselves
[0:20:00] Ribbwich: and that's refreshing now, but in three weeks when SoD is all meta-tized and all the engravings are found people gonna be flocking to where they can get that info
[0:20:10] metavahn231: then go find the info in the game, not on some file stolen from the server LUL
[0:20:34] metavahn231: ppl just wanna meta game on day 1 sickening
[0:20:47] magenof: imagine how fun raids would be, when no one knows anything, not the bosses, not the attacks, not any encounters, no spells, everything is new
[0:20:50] magenof: now thats a real race
[0:21:00] Ribbwich: Yeah sounds pretty frustrating
[0:21:13] REALPolarbeezy: turn chat off in game and dont open the internet if you dont want to know where it is
[0:21:39] Ribbwich: I mean, there is an extent that I agree with the anti-meta sentiment but that's on the players not the tools
[0:21:40] magenof: yeah then get kicked cause you didnt read the 15 page wowhead guide to the boss
[0:22:16] Ribbwich: sounds like a personal story
[0:22:40] magenof: nah i just played wow before wowhead was a thing
[0:23:06] Ribbwich: I mean... thottbot was a thing in classic, so...
[0:24:03] magenof: to each there own, i feel like a shared discovery is much fun than datamining
[0:24:58] REALPolarbeezy: most of the info was spread word of mouth before wowhead even updated anything
[0:25:05] REALPolarbeezy: imagine being social in an MMO
[0:26:07] Ribbwich: Again, you are blaming the tools instead of people, as if it's their fault there isn't a sense of discovery in the game anymore, and also, in live, it's way more fun to raid with a prepared raider instead of wiping because one guy wants a "more pure experience".
[0:27:48] magenof: you'll find the community way more engaged if nothing is spoiled before the expansion is even out
[0:32:06] CptKrazyEyez: Warlocks tank now?
[0:32:36] Ribbwich: if they can find the engraving
[0:32:39] cancer_97: Did they find the metamorph rune?
[0:32:47] Noshpan: In Season of Discovery
[0:32:52] Ribbwich: once they find the mystic enchant- i mean...

[2:02:12] headshot_hunter6: the one everyone wabts for priest is in a level 27 area
[2:02:13] Dixa1: they have a stupid meditation mechanic that requires other priests to bless you - including cross factoin - to use the rune
[2:02:40] Cptovios: thats incinerate
[2:02:46] CriticalPhil: thats stupid
[2:02:48] ArcaneSyntax: After all those priests kept stealing my mobs with penance, they deserve the bad rune drops
[2:03:05] matthorr: wandering swordsman for warriors is a fkin tragedy
[2:03:13] Molvonos: They have Windfury
[2:03:14] Dixa1: it's dumb. i could not unlock a dwarf rune in dwarf land until a human priest blessed me so i had TWO meditations
[2:03:19] CriticalPhil: get got windfury
[2:03:50] maximmayhem: is warlock actually going to be a viable tank option or just meme spec ?

[2:05:30] Shrenko: is metamorph not in the 1-25 phase for warlocks @Towelliee ?
[2:05:36] LiveJuniorr: Like I am a nightelf, can I get runes in elwyn forest?
[2:06:21] Molvonos: @LiveJuniorr Yep
[2:06:34] Dixa1: you dont want that mage milk?
[2:07:08] Zellidon: Mage healer is so ridiculous. So much utility in one class
[2:08:23] drunkieduckie: morning y'all
[2:08:45] Dixa1: if the rune is in the same place divine storm is you won't be getting it untli 25 or close to it
[2:09:07] Lupusdeus: I'm almost certain it's in, divine storm only got found like 12 hours ago, and that was an epic questline that took ages
[2:09:13] Shrenko: according to wowhead it is in the lvl 1-25 phase so its just not discovered yet
[2:09:22] Lamichii: you found master channel yet

[2:12:54] Magdelia: why are the reducing the healing arcane explosion does by 80% isnt that going to make it pointless to cast now?
[2:13:54] LiveJuniorr: Luka had a kiid, couldn't play.
[2:14:33] Lasuhu: yo towellie where did u get the metamorph rune?
[2:14:54] Tiamarilien: Mages are apparently compulsive gamblers. Most of the scrolls i've deciphered have been buff scrolls worse than the potions i make or other players buffs, but I keeo going because the next one might be a rez or a rune but at 7s a piece it gets expensive

[2:17:03] Shrenko: good gear good exp
[2:17:12] Tiamarilien: the rune ones are specific, the others are random. but the rez for mages is on scrolls too

[3:51:53] kekwnano: what server is towelie on
[3:51:57] snarkydonald: those ramps have issues when you jump off with aggro
[3:51:58] skrin001: you didnt pull warrior and mage had agro
[3:52:41] Molvonos: Yea, not sure how I got aggro unless mage healing is buggy with pulling aggro
[3:52:57] HilariousMax: SoD isn't hardcore ?
[3:53:10] Shrenko: no @HilariousMax
[3:53:18] gfield2k: nope @hilariousmax
[3:53:20] Shrenko: so mages get only 1 healing spell? a beam? thats it?
[3:53:44] Molvonos: For now
[3:53:51] gfield2k: they have an AOE heal as well @shrenko
[3:53:53] DEATHCODE77: other heal has not been found yet
[3:53:55] azurrei: its like atonement
[3:53:55] Jokervenom1978: I think mage heals need a buff
[3:53:55] mavericks312: isnt mage heal through arcane explosion and alter time
[3:53:56] nevercluckyy: priests are basically a disc priest but arcane

[3:54:15] ewoksmoonwalks: what website should i use to purchase the blizzard legacy hobby box?
[3:54:21] Reckless_Monk: I know huh
[3:54:32] Reckless_Monk: wtf does that mean.. "its easy" lol
[3:54:35] nevercluckyy: mage heals by putting up temporal on team then arcane blast heals the ones for a percent of the dmg
[3:54:39] mavericks312: @SolioCA classic is just as easy it just takes longer to level
[3:54:42] nevercluckyy: basically attonement healing
[3:54:48] TheEmcredible: meanwhile people in classic cant move out with living bomb in MC
[3:54:49] HilariousMax: Ziqo had some kind of lightning chain heal type thing going on

[4:08:30] mavericks312: i thought there woul;d be a dip cause of SoD
[4:08:57] Sollice: morning @towelliee quick first impressions what do you think of the oled
[4:09:29] Jdmsir94: blue item i think
[4:09:35] MoonwalkingAngel: staff?
[4:10:02] Sollice: yep. that’s because oled is per pixel color.
[4:10:11] Sollice: where led is in zones
[4:10:11] Broomba: what is your new monitor refresh rate set at @towelliee ?
[4:10:28] TettixHD: what monitor?
[4:10:40] Se7enthSinn: 500Htz?
[4:10:49] nytebayne: neat

[4:12:42] Armdel: can you even stream with HDR? i know screenshots looks as with it on
[4:12:48] grumpzzzz: Whats the monitor?
[4:12:48] TobziJD: Just type HDR
[4:12:50] Armdel: ass*

[4:12:56] Derca_: display settings in windows
[4:12:57] gherheart1: Windows Key + Alt + B

[4:12:58] TheCheeseWheel87: just type hdr in the search bar
[4:12:58] magenof: HDR fucks colors for streaming
[4:12:58] zombie_snacks666: display settings
[4:13:05] Sidnor: windows has a tool to setup hdr for your monitor
[4:13:16] KonceptionZ: hdr sucks
[4:13:34] Sollice: turn on auto hdr and the close wow and go back in.
[4:14:07] Sollice: moving forward any new games you play make sure hdr is turned on in the settings.

[4:14:39] magenof: higher dynamic range of colors :)
[4:14:44] Sollice: your downstairs tv won’t be as good looking as your oled
[4:14:47] Molvonos: Apparently my Mass Regen rune is in Duskwood.
[4:14:53] Scorpio1401: Only thing I know about HDR is it looks like crap if you don't have an HDR capable display KEKWlaugh
[4:14:54] MoonwalkingAngel: prettyer colors i think
[4:15:04] Sollice: that monitor is best 1000 bits means it will be super vibrant
[4:15:10] krimsontide97: if you don't mind me asking, what monitor do you have?

[4:15:27] gfield2k: yeah my LG OLED monitor is thin as well
[4:15:28] Sollice: I’ll make a monitor command in a second still sitting in bed lol
[4:15:44] Lostdogal: HDR has been adopted by companies to just mean brighter imo. As a capture format with video cameras it is much more important.
[4:16:07] krimsontide97: nice
[4:16:09] Seerated: Yea, monitor not able to show HDR will look washed out. Full OLED looks deep and rich, if you make the correct settings
[4:16:13] Sollice: I would love to get my hands on the flex
[4:16:13] gelimarr: price?
[4:16:15] dscholl82: man I got me a new ergonomic keyboard on cyber monday.   I'm back to having nasa mission control!
[4:16:20] Landict: yo
[4:16:20] Wulfgrym: i got 4 32inch monitors 2 of them are 1080p, considering getting a 27 inch, 32 inch monitors are just enormous
[4:16:26] krimsontide97: Lg does make the best OLED's
[4:16:31] zaint0: that's most overpriced BS you dont need 80% of what they advertise
[4:16:35] KonceptionZ: @Wulfgrym 27 is the perfect size
[4:17:13] Wulfgrym: @KonceptionZ yeah im beginning to agree, going to start to move down to 27 inch
[4:17:15] Armdel: yep im very happy with 27
[4:17:16] Seerated: LG still does the only OLED's. Even for other brands it's their tech
[4:17:18] Avaniss_: i love 27 inch
[4:17:29] honus03: I have 2 34 in ultra wides on my gaming rig.
[4:17:39] krimsontide97: get that samsung 57"
[4:17:41] TheEmcredible: been using 24 inch forever, do you relly think 27 inch is better than 24?
[4:17:53] conv3rge_: Samsung does QD-OLED as well.
[4:17:54] Scorpio1401: Woah.. that's cool
[4:18:05] Sollice: Samsung and Sony make their own panels also
[4:18:13] cammington_bear: @TheEmcredible subjective, i went from 27 inch to 24 inch and prefer it
[4:18:26] Wulfgrym: i like these asus tuf monitors i have but yeah seeing the diference with that oled
[4:18:28] Xenial70: once you go oled, you will never go back
[4:18:33] gelimarr: I also prefer 27
[4:18:59] nytebayne: 27 is pretty good for me
[4:19:03] jarilrpg: depends how close you are to your monitors/depth of desk
[4:19:08] Seerated: Samsung has QLED, Sony uses LG-panels for their OLED's. Atleast they used to

[4:19:47] conv3rge_: @Seerated Samsung also has their own QD-OLED.
[4:19:52] Wulfgrym: @Sollice beast lol
[4:19:54] zaint0: awww
[4:19:56] Seerated: OLED is amazing. Got a LG TV and there's nothing comparing. Will still burn your eyes in the beginning or if watching too much 4k HDR :D
[4:20:02] vetsttv: I just noticed you can life drain and auto attack. That’s broken. Lol.
[4:20:04] futomara01: @BigFatAnimal true that

[4:21:06] GKGxGrimjax: what monitor you have a link
[4:21:29] Nerendis: Layering takes a sec. And you can't be in combat
[4:21:30] Seerated: QLED is brighter in NITS, OLED can go completely black. That what's bringing the contrast
[4:21:44] conv3rge_: @HorseFromHorseHeresy QD-OLED is Samsung's OLED technology, it is not LCD. QLED is Samsung's LCD.

[4:24:06] Sollice: @towelliee play overwatch off stream. HDR amazing colors and high refresh rate.  you will see more of what the monitor can do than on WoW
[4:24:07] Kitsua: I never thought there was that big of a difference, but then I saw the OLED switch compared to the normal and it was soo different
[4:24:16] Seerated: @HorseFromHorseHeresy Ok, I might be wrong, was a few years since I bought mine. I see now that Samsung has their Quantum Dot-OLED combingin brightenss with depth.

[4:25:37] Sollice: yeah I know you don’t I just mean to test it out
[4:25:41] Nokterian: playing WoW in Ultra Wide Monitor is still the best choice i made
[4:25:47] MoonwalkingAngel: spiderman 2 should look pretty on new monitor
[4:26:08] gfield2k: do you play 2042 @towelliee ?
[4:26:15] Seerated: @Seerated Is that only for monitors or do they use them for TV's aswell ?
[4:26:15] Nerendis: YOu have to be out of combat
[4:26:27] Sayryn: I'm on Layer 4
[4:26:31] Molvonos: Sould be instant
[4:26:33] Nerendis: sometimes 2 minutes. There is a CD after combat
[4:26:43] TheEmcredible: sometimes instant, sometimes ages
[4:26:43] RoguelolBeast: addon
[4:26:47] Sayryn: Nova World Buffs
[4:26:57] TheFruitee: in order to know your layer --- Nova Instance Tracker addon
[4:27:00] Nerendis: There is also a CD if you already swapped layesr
[4:27:07] conv3rge_: @Seerated I think the only TV with it is the Samsung S90/S95
[4:27:08] TheFruitee: Nova World buffs*
[4:27:12] Sayryn: I think it's Nova World Buffs
[4:27:12] Wulfgrym: downloading that shit lol
[4:27:15] RoguelolBeast: Nova World buffs, shows layer
[4:27:28] nevercluckyy: that quest took me 4 hours last night...
[4:27:38] Nerendis: No you are on that layer now. And have a CD to swap again
[4:28:02] FerociouzMonk: layer on layer like lasagna slow cooked
[4:28:20] Armdel: asmon is about to log on to that layer monkaS
[4:28:24] N3llee: map
[4:28:37] mmrghost7: no clue for meta yet ?
[4:28:40] N3llee: look at stormwind
[4:28:48] Sayryn: Mine shows on my mini map, but I'm using Sexy map and not ElvUi
[4:28:54] Nerendis: How long is shutdown?
[4:29:13] Sayryn: Click on an NPC
[4:29:16] Broomba: click your mini addon button and click dragon icon
[4:29:27] RoguelolBeast: thats how many guildees are in
[4:29:32] Seerated: @HorseFromHorseHeresy I see there's a 55" and 65" atleast. Interesting. Also good for competition to not only have LG do the panels for other brands(well, except Samsung then)
[4:29:37] Exitarnium: Layer is usually shown on the minimap, could be fuckd cus ur using an addon
[4:29:40] N3llee: its the layer id
[4:29:41] Nerendis: Thats the laery ID
[4:30:05] Nerendis: You typically have to kill a mob for the addon to figure out your layer
[4:30:14] Nerendis: or nPC interact
[4:30:14] subjectevil: you may have to restart the game, to get the addon to see the layer you are on
[4:30:39] conv3rge_: @HorseFromHorseHeresy Oh yeah, for sure, competition is always good. LG still way more mature/refined on a lot of features and protections

[4:31:53] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Exitarnium (warning)
[4:32:06] Sayryn: Mine says Click and NPC to update your layer.
[4:32:12] Ginndora: Ginndora converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[4:32:25] gsting: i thought to see your layer you had to go to a main city and it would calculate your layer
[4:32:32] N3llee: The last version I was using would in fact tell. Just wondering if they changed something or maybe addon is bugged for sod?
[4:32:35] N3llee: not sure
[4:32:45] Ginndora: Ginndora subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 82 months! 
[4:32:56] sycnessx: at least it wasn't a turnover on downs
[4:32:57] c0mmander_starscream: converted from Quin
[4:33:00] deviltom198: how you liking lock?
[4:33:04] Ginndora: No, appreciate you!
[4:33:05] Seerated: @HorseFromHorseHeresy Yea, I never understood Samsungs line of 500 different models each year... LG maintains a good service, exchanging panels with burn-in etc. My C7 is 2017 so it has a big square burn-in but still rocks :)
[4:33:06] Exitarnium: Working fine for me, layer is shown on the minimap could be scuffed since you're using a minimap addon
[4:33:08] PotbellyGoat: Got my MTN DEW reward point D4 cosmetics

[4:34:19] Wulfgrym: its helping the guild
[4:34:23] Seerated: Had I been able to join I'd send 10 buckaroonys !

[6:48:32] The_PatientZero: if meta isnt in this phase that would suck
[6:48:35] magemaster225: p sure they said all 12 for each class can be found and more will be added later
[6:48:36] Limpickles: they wouldn't have advertised lock tank if it wasn't goign to be available
[6:48:36] Rapunzele: @Towelliee No cuz lock meta was in the testing for BFD
[6:48:37] binkz77: all 12 for each class are in live
[6:48:37] Wrexsoul: I think WoWhead touched base on that; that some runes won't be available until phase 2 and so forth
[6:48:38] Curatho: it 12 runes a class for this phase
[6:48:38] geokouts: possible due to lvl restrictions
[6:48:41] notdustinx: idk, i think they give us 2 months for them to be found
[6:48:50] Aidler: the crazy stuff they normally find… and this can’t be found…. very suss
[6:48:51] Ferokz: Maybe you need to fish something out of the water.. lol
[6:48:51] clambynature: i'd make it a lvl 40 warlock quest
[6:49:00] Sir_KnightErrant: Dude there was a rune in org where you talk to the cook and says something about some drunk driving away business. you kill him and he gives you a rune. No quest symbol or anything. @Towelliee
[6:49:04] nevercluckyy: im still convinced that theocritus in elywynn forest has something to do with getting meta....
[6:49:06] TheeCableguy: No, I shot him
[6:49:07] Treevinal: whatever you do, don't shoot him
[6:49:09] Lostdogal: Messanger has the meta rune
[6:49:09] Lamichii: messenger being spawned camp and moon location
[6:49:30] matryok: whats your xp bar addon?
[6:49:35] Thee_Phantom_Spider: Im playing all the WoW's right now
[6:49:56] geokouts: messanger spawns outside Smith on the road
[6:50:12] geokouts: Moonbrook
[6:50:19] mmrghost7: is it possible taht meta is not even in this phase ?
[6:50:45] Aidler: they haven’t found the rune till now means it’s not in the current game
[6:50:52] Hydroglific88: What is this meta thing yall talking about?
[6:50:55] Wulfgrym: i thought they said meta might be a chain quest
[6:51:03] mavericks312: taht would beso bad if they actually kept one of the more hype runes outta this phase
[6:51:18] geokouts: Maybe it is on Deadwing pass? or near Karazhan?
[6:51:25] nevercluckyy: @towelliee if they followed lore to set up the line for meta theocritus was the number one enemeny of morganth who was guarding the orb/staff which is the main known part of the meta line so far.
[6:51:27] Laelas_sm: wouldnt be shocked if some runes were attached to ashenvale pvp stuff
[6:51:38] Wulfgrym: @mavericks312 facts
[6:51:41] Foretoldlegends: Oh no. The Defias Messenger waiting list.
[6:51:50] Aidler: there are insanely sweaty guys out there and if they can’t find it. it’s not looking good
[6:52:02] Ferokz: This looks like there is a ritual about to happen LUL
[6:52:43] Mortuno: tangLUL
[6:53:00] Gotxiko: has to be some ritual of some kind
[6:53:15] BStabes22: There is one where you literally have to talk to a cook in Org for warriors and then kill them. I feel like the other 5 that most classes are missing are going to be weird things like that
[6:53:15] Curatho: on my server the saying its in ashenval prequest same for the palading deviine storm
[6:53:21] S1appadabass: heal the woons to get the runes
[6:53:25] PGTrim: Theres the indigestion potion that asks to speak to someone with unfinished business with the mortal world.
[6:53:31] PGTrim: Discord is cooking rn
[6:53:36] Rhyu_: i was running around in darkshore and someone was asking for lvl 20 warlocks to help them with a quest for meta, but could be bullshit
[6:53:37] Bloodhaven08: its gonna be like you need 5 warlock standing in a circle chanting to summon an elite who you then have to kill
[6:53:41] Ezekyler: sacrifice a streamer in the altar of blood to uinlock the rune Kappa
[6:54:04] Wulfgrym: thats commitment LUL
[6:54:10] brannjord: Honestly I love how people are searching nook and crany for these runes.

[7:02:02] i_flip_whales: I really think it's been found. I've seen a dude with a demon I don't recognize (not a lock though so maybe it wasn't it?)
[7:02:16] Panadol324: studentalbatros make a video how to get it from what i heard
[7:02:33] Drekorve: Druids could do that too
[7:02:36] REALPolarbeezy: CHAT HAS FIGURED IT OUT
[7:02:42] nuuenergy: in the water off Azshara?

[7:03:03] DeanoTV: weird, studen always made good vids
[7:03:07] i_flip_whales: @The_Yonaz Just much slower I think
[7:03:10] Lamichii: i reckon he is SFK
[7:03:15] stratiss: i'd say it's in ashenvale with the demon dudes somewhere
[7:03:18] Wulfgrym: the underwater idea is definitely a good idea
[7:03:26] Alaquane: it's in karazhan
[7:03:31] S1appadabass: stonetalon has had some good runes found there
[7:03:32] Shugaze: or ashenvale near the burning legion?

[7:04:01] lithium364: its in ragefire chasm for alliance
[7:04:10] i_flip_whales: @The_Yonaz It'd make sense
[7:04:10] ninedraft317: i think its in ridgewood at the bottom of the lake
[7:04:10] thecynicalshuffler: yeah it has to be findable in the earlier levels. i mean they did you it as an example in a lot of the promotional stuff they did so to not have it would be stupid

[7:38:13] Zellidon: Right now I think mage heals is the most utility spec. Sheep. Portals. Heals. Food & Drink. Evocate for more heals. Insane potential

[7:47:09] Treevinal: Most of my YT ads are Advanced.GG
[7:47:15] aigamingdk: They found the rogue tanking rune, you need Honored with the Wayliad supply crate guys, you get the Everlasting affliction for warlocks when you get honered
[7:47:20] aigamingdk: in case you didnt see yet,
[7:48:14] Snabido: Since DH rune aint found yet, are there other supporting runes found
[7:48:16] Snabido: ?
[7:48:19] Sollice: @PotbellyGoat Check you Twitch whispers
[7:48:21] churrodude: can’t say I’m a big fan of supply crates
[7:48:26] mavericks312: i feel like the lock tanking run e should have been one of the early runes you found
[7:48:42] churrodude: agree
[7:49:12] mavericks312: like lock tanking might have been the most hype thing coing into SoD along with shammy tanking
[7:49:13] Amerra: I heard for the Wayliad crates that it's not worth it to fill them for currency gain. Is it worth it to fill them for the reputation gain?
[7:49:19] SamuraiWillZ916: hat level do you even get meta?
[7:49:25] thumpper__: Icy Veins hasn't been found for mages yet either so it seems like the very powerful ones are harder to find
[7:49:28] AviasNelan: will the next level bracket unlock more rune slots?
[7:50:12] mavericks312: hiding runes behind the supply stuff seems weak tbh

[7:50:46] Gezber: Oof. Imagine having a drop rate from the supplies
[7:50:48] Mortuno: tangLUL
[7:50:51] mavericks312: SoD would die instantly for locks,shammys lol
[7:50:53] cyclonos: i think its in ashenvale where all the burning legion mobs are

[7:51:03] Sollice: @Towelliee The link should be blacklisted now :P
[7:51:07] tlsmith3638: you have to find the jailor to get the meta rune
[7:51:08] Sollice: for that vide4o
[7:51:15] AzedaNA: You have to tank a whole DM with just your Voidwalker to get it
[7:51:16] UltraKSlaya: it has to be a special quest chain to get it or something
[7:51:47] mavericks312: ill go on a limb an say the meta rune should have been the level 2 rune you got
[7:52:15] Snabido: In before they took Green Fire questline from retail for the meta rune CoolCat
[7:52:28] Sholmes2: Yeah I’m thinking Quest chain too. Warlocks have a lot question chains for mounts and summoned demons
