[0:26:28] PastaSeat: additional tuning. Locks might not be the GODS we thought
[0:26:28] MaybeRespect: I mean. People said armor buffs weren't a big deal since alot of melee doing magic damage. So the bear form nerf aint a big deal either.
[0:26:51] mpresz: @nickc2122 thats exactly what i mean... they catering to mongo play.

[0:29:16] jporter_: how big of an impact is the armor changes?
[0:29:20] MaybeRespect: @nickc2122 We really don't need heal buffs. We need BURST reduction.
[0:29:21] hamsti: hamsti subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 2 month streak! neat
[0:29:47] actualreallifebillionaire: gg, now my ironman bear form only feral druid to 1600 challenge is completely screwed. thanks blizzard.

[0:31:28] qkmood: trying to normalize sub rogue/mm dmg or something
[0:31:34] MaybeRespect: @nickc2122 Burst healing also. Though
[0:31:36] nickc2122: imagine you play shuffle at 2500 2600+ mmr and the only thing people do is mash damage and don't even press kick.
[0:31:37] Vigi9413: people enjoy big burst, big burst sells
[0:31:40] actualreallifebillionaire: if i cant comfortably heal through 2 DPS with a beer in one hand then DPS are too powerful. Healers need HUGE buffs, im talking 40%+ throughput buff across the board (maybe only ~25% for rdruid)
[0:31:49] nickc2122: @MaybeRespect yeah dude nerf rdruid so every healer quits tuesday :)
[0:32:20] misterblaht: @Vigi9413 Lol big true.
[0:32:28] misterblaht: Biiiiig damm
[0:32:28] nickc2122: just give all healers another button to press like grove guardians and you won't have a issue with the game. :)
[0:32:32] pvalue01: low key excited about rsham after changes. our meatballs are gonna be JUICY
[0:32:44] MaybeRespect: @nickc2122 Bro man. Your responses have no critical thinking.
[0:32:45] rynosaurwow: Looks like they added armor nerfs to ele sham and locks as well. Outlaw rogues love to see it
[0:32:48] nickc2122: don't forget team mash damage
[0:32:57] actualreallifebillionaire: yeah, big burst sells - big burst has sold me on PAL WORLD
[0:33:03] nickc2122: @MaybeRespect yeah dude nerf rdruid we get it, healer is broken. 50 0 1.5s
[0:33:15] nickc2122: and not a single healer can heal it
[0:33:18] PastaSeat: @actualreallifebillionaire time for someone to make WoW but all of the classes use GUNS
[0:33:23] MaybeRespect: Bro what the heck. Are you confusing me and someone else @nickc2122 ?
[0:33:32] nickc2122: this guy right here plays all damage classes ^
[0:33:40] biofreaks: Stop nerfing healers and just bring them ALL up to rdruid level. Damage is already too high and healing is rough as is.
[0:33:41] brewtank: boomkins get railed in shuffle i swear
[0:33:49] straighttokes420: 11 KEKW
[0:34:07] nickc2122: @biofreaks hm. he said it too. i wonder why this why guys keep @ing me lol...
[0:34:11] actualreallifebillionaire: im stuck at 1200 in shuffle on my rdruid, why is it getting nerfed?

[0:34:50] PastaSeat: It's gonna be a RET WORLD, and we're just living in it
[0:35:15] MaybeRespect: @PastaSeat Why? Armor changes don't help ret.
[0:35:15] misterblaht: Kwok back on the top where he belongs.
[0:35:37] misterblaht: vanWhat vanWhat
[0:35:38] nickc2122: @MaybeRespect ret's damage is getting buffed.
[0:35:39] PastaSeat: 20% Wake, 30% to Wake DoT + extra hits, and 20% Blade of Justice, and 10% FV buffs do though
[0:36:01] nickc2122: you should read the class tuning and you will know what you are talking about haha
[0:36:01] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:36:05] MaybeRespect: @nickc2122 Yea not wrong. Dh/ret prob
[0:36:22] nickc2122: @MaybeRespect clearly you haven't read the notes. dh isn't nerfed either.
[0:36:44] MaybeRespect: Nic, are you a bot. Please stop
[0:36:49] nickc2122: it's pretty clear why 90% of the pvp player base doesn't realize it's obv what their goals are. nerf healing, nerf defensives, buff damage.
[0:37:43] nickc2122: @MaybeRespect why would i be a bot? i am just speaking the truth brother.
[0:37:44] pvalue01: stam buff should hurt sub rogue a little
[0:38:00] brewtank: @pvalue01 is it for healers and dps or just healers?
[0:38:00] MaybeRespect: @nickc2122 Because your @ing me saying the opposite of what i am
[0:38:17] nickc2122: because your responses are not logical. it's obv to why they are nerfing armor lol
[0:38:18] Habaden: boys what race should i boost my rogue
[0:38:26] brewtank: @nickc2122 @MaybeRespect dm each other
[0:38:39] brewtank: @Habaden nelf ofc
[0:38:48] pvalue01: @brewtank both, but more for dps
[0:39:39] MaybeRespect: @brewtank Ye ima just stop responding I think he trolling me :P
[0:40:36] nickc2122: @MaybeRespect lol.

[0:42:49] Marshypie: Lock armor nerf
[0:42:52] brewtank: bear form needed that
[0:42:54] jo4sho85: so lock only gets a slight buff right?
[0:43:04] orochipala: lock also
[0:43:08] brewtank: Kappa
[0:43:09] pvalue01: they still didnt pvp tag the ret buffs? LUL
[0:43:27] brewtank: honestly bear form with 2x frenzy is ok but after that u die lol
[0:43:33] drummond777: what up dew
[0:43:44] biofreaks: @buffferal
[0:43:54] zachgamegodx: ii mean ui can do dmg since u literally just otherwise clone and wiat for astral power from dot ticks
[0:43:55] zachgamegodx: to starsurge
[0:43:58] carbonzo_bean: harry potter patch
[0:43:58] zachgamegodx: taht spec is giga toxic
[0:44:03] admiraltegetthoff: so this is effectively a nerf to lock, it will has less armor then right now. Also what is armored to the teeth from warr? xd
[0:44:07] nickc2122: they added stamina in season 2 and it did nothing 2 weeks later imo
[0:44:13] drummond777: you sick or is your voice going out?
[0:44:36] zachgamegodx: i hate boomkins so much, not saying they'r eoverpowered atm but i think their design is so dumb and for many seasons have been oppressive
[0:44:37] pvalue01: new meta just train healers all day?
[0:44:48] crucybletv: so maybe my math is wrong but doesnt this mean warlocks will be less tanky than currently?

[0:45:46] nickc2122: the bear change is prob to target rdruid
[0:45:49] whompastyle: top 5
[0:45:58] Fugeki22: do you feel like the upcoming changes is going to affect your tourny prep a lot?

[0:50:12] ShaHugs: think they're trying to make damage more consistent
[0:50:17] tmiller87: feral has the highest deaths of any melee in solo shuffle they need the extra heailing

[0:50:47] moopyboopydoopy: isnt it a natural opioid
[0:50:53] nickc2122: maybe they are trying to nerf the overperforming classes without actually nerfing damage instead target armor
[0:51:20] Zissuri14: its kratom*
[0:51:21] nickc2122: it seems weird they would target armor
[0:51:25] biofreaks: hunters

[0:51:53] Aro725: fuck hunters
[0:51:54] shredder1111: to me it's them balancing around solo shuffle which would make sense since it's got the most active players

[0:52:43] bigbootybaddie: this is prolly  dumb question but as an evoker do you take nullifying shroud in pvp? 🙂
[0:52:49] moopyboopydoopy: these changes just seem bizarre
[0:53:05] nickc2122: i believe it's nerf healling, nerf defensives, buff damage.

[1:43:20] What_ln_Tarnation: we love reversions
[1:43:26] ttvbarely_average: lol as a person who heals 90% of the time in arenas i would kill for some lessons to get me to the next level above 2100 from the GOAT healer.
[1:43:41] Itankarenas: BRUH Demon Skin increases armor by 22.5%/45% in PvP (was 45%/90%).
[1:43:51] Itankarenas: Pepehands
[1:43:53] Itankarenas: wtf
[1:44:09] hamsti: you know who's not tanking arenas after patch? Kappa warlocks
[1:44:17] chrisiirc: that ele and rsham armour nerfs seem really silly
[1:44:31] cutexlol_: arent he armor changes only like 2-3% physical anyway? most classes do 90+% magical dmg
[1:44:44] chrisiirc: that adds up with a warrior training
[1:45:00] admiraltegetthoff: its 3-5% its whatever
[1:45:03] chrisiirc: or any melee for that matter
[1:45:09] Itankarenas: @hamsti only gonna be tanking rating Sadge
[1:45:12] AngryStapler: @hamsti every clothie but locks are dying too easy with no armor. lets buff all of them including warlocks 5Head
[1:45:22] chrisiirc: if its 3-5% then just leave it alone
[1:45:53] bestchaakbestjjang: RMX is best comp in the game by far with this patch anyways
[1:46:02] bestchaakbestjjang: *new patch
[1:46:38] cutexlol_: finally we got a patch where RMX is good Keepo always the underdog classes
[1:46:55] middlebeach: nice chuck, finish em off now
[1:47:20] headgrumble: He's using Emerald Blossom to heal you at times, isn't that poopoo, and instead use it for echo?
[1:47:22] Swishinn: is there a world that its worth taking cataclysm into things like demo lock/unh dk? being able to get immolate on all those pets seems kinda nutty
[1:47:24] WagwanBombaClatBomba: holy faaak, the dew already on that lock practising trenXD
[1:47:25] 101Leet: Nice try, was a solid match
[1:47:37] izza_cat: emerald blossom is bad imo

[1:52:26] 101Leet: @kondal13 im honestly so proud of u
[1:52:39] kondal13: thank you <3
[1:52:42] bestchaakbestjjang: warriors didnt get armor buffs. they got compensated strength buffs
[1:52:47] Itankarenas: well, time to drop 4 set as lock. back to 7.5k vers YEP
[1:53:02] bestchaakbestjjang: because of one of their talents gave strength based on armor
[1:53:03] McLarge: They're nerfing Bear Form, Warlock, and Ele Armor while buffing the Strength talent for Warrior so they don't lose a piece of gear's worth of main stat
[1:53:20] Cdenzy: so locks went from a 30% armor buff to a 7% nerf?
[1:53:20] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:53:26] izza_cat: @kondal13 its been a minute since ive played my pres. do you press spirit blossom when you get a proc or are you just pressing whenever?
[1:53:35] itz_killjoy: its a 15% overall armor nerf to locks
[1:53:40] Itankarenas: DH got no nerfs tho. what a fuckin joke KEKW
[1:53:49] bestchaakbestjjang: i mean that’s not a bad nerf @mclarge . rdruids cant be the tankiest spec in the game and also best healer at the same time
[1:53:51] bestchaakbestjjang: fuck rdruids
[1:53:52] middlebeach: dude they cant nerf bear form. its over for us ferals if they nerf bear form...
[1:54:08] Itankarenas: @middlebeach see you next xpac
[1:54:10] middlebeach: they need to just nerf it for resto and erase the change for feral at least
[1:54:26] bestchaakbestjjang: @middlebeach , they dont want to balance feral
[1:54:32] itz_killjoy: no clue why they nerfed ele shaman armor LUL they need more defensives not less
[1:54:39] Swishinn: they nerfed bear form armor, warlock demon skin, buffed warr str from armor talent, and nerfed ele sham armor
[1:54:40] middlebeach: i always play feral no matter what, hard enough as it is rn. having trouble breaking 2200
[1:54:43] bestchaakbestjjang: when feral is good, they are toxic as fuck with clone->frenzy spam
[1:54:44] middlebeach: in shuffle
[1:54:54] bestchaakbestjjang: they prob dont want to balance that nightmare
[1:55:06] middlebeach: a rework would be a good idea
[1:55:08] McLarge: @bestchaakbestjjang I didn't say it was bad. I will say that to me though, the Armor changes are all completely irrelevant. I'm a DH main and all of my damage is Magic, so I ignore Armor anyway
[1:55:32] bestchaakbestjjang: yeah you are a dirty dh scum kekw
[1:55:41] NASAdesigner: lol top of ss udk ignores observer 6-0's :)
[1:55:52] lukrexwow: lool
[1:56:05] 101Leet: Damn got straight planted
[1:56:13] bestchaakbestjjang: i swear they should just nerf ele completely so we stop seeing these chinese ele botters
[1:56:32] McLarge: @bestchaakbestjjang You'll just see Chinese SP botters instead
[1:56:32] middlebeach: what is better gems for a feral druid, mastery-verse or mastery-haste
[1:56:43] middlebeach: anyone have any ideas?
[1:56:46] bestchaakbestjjang: there arent that many @mclarge .
[1:57:05] McLarge: @bestchaakbestjjang I mean... Pokemons is the most prominent botter and he plays both.
[1:57:23] bestchaakbestjjang: only one obvious SP bot and its pokemons
[1:57:29] McLarge: It's not that much of a stretch to assume that the Ele botters would just reroll SP and bot that spec instead
[1:57:33] IlikePotatoess: I swear ever since the patch my character detargets my target randomly sometimes
[1:57:35] bestchaakbestjjang: theres literal hundreds of ele botters
[1:57:46] bestchaakbestjjang: and SP is way easier to handle
[1:57:51] Karaelolz: hunter is getting 6-0 at this point
[1:57:58] Karaelolz: wtf
[1:58:01] wafflezxo: Kieted is an obvious SP botter
[1:58:04] zachgamegodx: i think that aura mastery on the dk dh goes is actually pretty sick
[1:58:10] zachgamegodx: underrated dew
[1:58:14] bestchaakbestjjang: kieted is pokemons @wafflezxo

[1:58:51] symbolism369: @bestchaakbestjjang no they shouyld just completely IP ban and ID ban the botters perma insta everytime they try to make acc w same card its auto denied by card holder name and or IP
[1:59:32] middlebeach: pokemons is a botter?
[1:59:35] bestchaakbestjjang: IP/ID ban doesnt work at all. you know how easy that shit is to get around lmao @symbolism369 .
[1:59:46] symbolism369: @middlebeach yea
[1:59:47] McLarge: @middlebeach Yes.
[1:59:48] Zacaree55: IP ban? Ah yes. Ill just use a VPN
[1:59:48] Zacaree55: KEKW
[1:59:53] bestchaakbestjjang: same card what? you can just use a gift card too
[2:00:07] middlebeach: thats actually wild
[2:00:20] symbolism369: @bestchaakbestjjang sue the ppl making the bots then, bc pokele makes the bots and sells it
[2:00:41] symbolism369: @bestchaakbestjjang if blizz sued pokele, p sure he would stop
[2:00:48] bestchaakbestjjang: omegalul
[2:00:50] jonv0: do you use your star power to distract your enemies
[2:00:51] Zacaree55: @cdewx ??
[2:00:55] McLarge: @middlebeach I guess you missed the news, but he got banned at the end of last season. He did a whole appeal thing on his Twitch and it showed that he'd been banned for botting like, 7 times prior
[2:00:56] izza_cat: that R druid was chasing you the complete wrong way
[2:00:56] wafflezxo: leave the accounts open for people that bot but disable all pvp queues on the account
[2:00:58] Zacaree55: How dare you use ur mobility
[2:01:04] omelletas: that druid acts like he doest know where the portals are
[2:01:04] izza_cat: yeah man stand still????
[2:01:10] symbolism369: @bestchaakbestjjang it worked on honorbuddy ppl
[2:02:01] Lydiayang: IP ban actually works if it's connected with credit card and personal info, like how Ebay does it. but surely blizz won't do that
[2:02:55] bestchaakbestjjang: you can use gift cards. stop saying dumb stuff
[2:03:12] symbolism369: @bestchaakbestjjang not if they make that not acceptable form of payment
[2:03:49] bestchaakbestjjang: theres also this thing called wow token friend

[5:30:21] sadccookie: the armor changes are weird idk what sparked that
[5:30:25] vibesham: Seems like they just want all armor values to be roughly the same
[5:30:42] jasuvex: these changes are so random, nobody asked fot these, they make no sense...
[5:30:47] DirtyYankee0: yeah that was my guess as well
[5:30:47] jasuvex: ye makes it easier if they did any
[5:30:51] lustevit: fuck it, just nerf feral defensives too
[5:30:55] vibesham: That's the only conclusion that makes sense imo
[5:30:59] DirtyYankee0: but plate should always take less physical
[5:31:06] Yanzoh: i think it would be cool to have hover break roots! even if its a talent choice
[5:31:06] What_ln_Tarnation: does that mean plate tanks gonna be even squishier than non plate tanks?
