[1:05:45] TyHouston_: priest leggo? lolol

[1:07:51] gellehar: Azshara will surely be in midnight
[1:07:54] Lenietwitch: i hope she is not "working" for a bigger evil like sylv / jailer, taht was dogshit
[1:07:59] Sollice: I don't think Iridikron goes. I think he actually is trying to protect Azeroth against the titans
[1:08:05] Effin_Steffin: hear me out.. at the end of Worldsoul Saga Azeroth says she's too wounded to sustain likfe. Ports us to a new planet in cosmos. Boom. WoW 2.
[1:08:10] rosina_scarlett: My guess is when Thrall said the sword was aimed at "someone" I think Sargeras was aiming at Xal'atath
[1:08:11] Venasmat: We still have to learn about the Void Lords though
[1:08:13] NYKO7_: I need to see Iridikrons confrontation with the Titans
[1:08:16] DunzoCD: midnight we will get the Xalatath v Sylvanas face off
[1:08:17] kimmo_gaming: What if hes plan is actually to steal Titan's power???

[1:36:01] Blackhaxx: bots will take care of that anyway LUL
[1:36:02] DunzoCD: it will be huge for crafters
[1:36:02] EpicJune: they do get the whole weekend to farm i guess
[1:36:03] melvinfart: its not a very nice thing to ask the developers, not really their thing to decide for early release
[1:36:05] kyotoboss: it doesn't matter at all for 99.9%
[1:36:10] lumaday: Think it will smooth out the launch day @Towelliee ?
[1:36:14] Queenjii: That too, but more so the fact that it's just shitty to have to wait while others start playing earlier
[1:36:15] DunzoCD: getting that early crafting xp is huge
[1:36:17] Gingerprimer: Yes but goldmakers already have the billion gold to buy tokens for ealry
[1:36:19] Kindosar: goldmakers would buy with gold anyway, wouldn't matter
[1:36:22] lighirr: its also fun to figure out gearing  strategy at start, even if useless, farming rares at DF start was fun event
[1:36:23] chazemoto: @Towelliee I just wonder how the world first 80 will work with the 3 day early thing
[1:36:37] digaboom: The three day gap is lame, but also like… I get it
[1:36:41] falldrgn: Why the fuck are they doing this.. HELL  D4 early access was in the heroic edition.
[1:36:42] Mr_Pennywise_: towLets towGo towHAMUP
[1:36:44] DelroyTV: most goldmaker, that are playing the AH more than anything else, have the gold to buy epic edition anyhow
[1:36:45] snarkydonald: I think with the d4 launch data, they'll be fine..
[1:36:46] Amarlian: My tinfoil hat prediction is they will have to give away free game time for the 3 days. It's a prime target for DDOS. Let alone getting it to flag your account properly. @Towelliee
[1:36:48] shinas: i mean the pre access will most likely be during the weekend.  Ofc its shitty for someone to wait esp. during the weekend @Towelliee
[1:36:53] emznev: Is the new dwarf race coming in the war within just alliance or horde to?
[1:36:58] Fox_Cainhurst: what browser you use Towlliee?
[1:37:00] belfastcl: I think only crafters-people making gold are left behind if they don't grab the early access
[1:37:05] Kinghorn: 2 extra sets of splits, thanks 3 day headstart guzuBeliever
[1:37:09] Honvar: @emznev Both
[1:37:10] Kindosar: @emznev neutral
[1:37:10] xstraightbrutal: stop being lazy chat and buy the epic edition :D
[1:37:13] NobodybetterPat: I’d use the 3 days to mine and herb lol
[1:37:13] Gingerprimer: @emznev nah like pandas
[1:37:13] MysticRaven_: @emznev both factions
[1:37:17] Docta_G: They are gonna go the D4 route, and the 3 day early access will fall on a Friday

[1:37:34] emznev: OK cool nice
[1:37:38] DunzoCD: so like diablo, the early access will be over the weekend and if you dont have early access you cant play til the work week
[1:37:39] Amarlian: I will enjoy the videos of the people trying to get to the new expansion area without having to pay for the access
[1:37:42] mlewis4011: Early weekend is awesome if you have a regular hours job!
[1:37:44] Hekseez: me too
[1:37:46] Asuo_: The thing that pisses me off is the heroic vs epic edition is stark in contrast. Heroic only exist for people to go "fuck it epic is better value"
[1:37:47] kyotoboss: hyped for the "stupid" delv helmets :D
[1:37:50] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Blindsir (warning)

[1:38:14] fewyn: you get a boost and 30 day game time
[1:38:16] chazemoto: SoD is on a thursday

[1:38:28] Rudric_Ice: server issues on friday get ready for it LUL
[1:38:30] mrwaddles22: early access shouldnt belong in a paid subscription game
[1:38:30] Amarlian: agreed
[1:38:30] MR_WYTE: Good morning folks. ☕️
[1:38:35] DunzoCD: i mean the game time alone is 15
[1:38:40] zorantt: At least with Epic Edition, you get the game with it @Towelliee Kappa
[1:38:42] NerdyTeK: boost xpan and game time

[1:39:06] LunaryOne: ye but there's no way a character boost is worth $60 so the price is skewed
[1:39:08] Alaquane: oh it comes with game time.
[1:39:08] NovaNax: its actually way more expensive for Sweden for me that 90 is 100 euros which is way to expensive
[1:39:10] Rudric_Ice: 800% value
[1:39:13] MysticRaven_: the mount had dragonriding and custom pieces like the drakes
[1:39:13] theDirtyon3: server reasons?
[1:39:16] snarkydonald: What, no faction change? scam.
[1:39:18] Trawkey: Problem is that i only want the 3 days early access. I dont care about the pets and mounts n stuff
[1:39:21] Asuo_: If anything heroic edition is NOT worth $70, its lost value and there to justify epic @Towelliee
[1:39:22] Hekseez: i always buy base edition :)
[1:39:23] Sollice: I like 3 days early access it makes my epeen huger than normies
[1:39:23] the_oracie: i brought both epic versions, i aint complaining
[1:39:26] magemaster225: early access is just becoming the industry norm now
[1:39:27] NerdyTeK: include a year of gamepass
[1:39:28] Alsparq: it was huge selling point of D4
[1:39:32] Rat_One: i dont care about that other stuff, i care about those 3 days, watching others play, who has this money
[1:39:35] DunzoCD: its gonna feel real bad for people that dont have the epic version and cant play til the work week
[1:39:35] Lenietwitch: wasnt DF also early acces ? can't remember
[1:39:35] falldrgn: I don't get why they are locking beta behind the epic edition.  is that the only way to get beta or that 100% guarenteed beta spot
[1:39:35] devoted_bee: Or they saw how successful it was for D4
[1:39:36] Sylphy_TV: ironmouseJam
[1:39:37] Docta_G: @Towelliee FF14 did 3 day early for everyone who pre-purchased, not just special edition
[1:39:38] Sc0B1t: No collecters edition?
[1:39:38] Aidler: 3 days early access is a MS thing
[1:39:40] Queenjii: It's just sad that this is the direction WoW is heading

[1:39:54] theDirtyon3: @Sollice i feed off the salty tears of the dissenters
[1:39:57] antoniusyo: how about no early acces?
[1:39:59] snarkydonald: Or end of year. push them 2023 salez
[1:40:02] Amarlian: At least for D4, they can shut off the servers for everyone else. I am really curious how they will do it
[1:40:02] MysticRaven_: honestly the mount having dragonriding and custom options like the drakes makes it worth it
[1:40:03] ElmSpace: also trying to stabilize launch by splitting people up into two groups probably
[1:40:07] WSilverHawkW: @Sollice no, it was 90
[1:40:15] jsullivanj: so weird
[1:40:16] Nokterian: alpha/beta early access sure but for the release itself?
[1:40:19] theDirtyon3: just wait for the collecter edition KEKW
[1:40:20] WundertueteGER: EZ
[1:40:25] digaboom: I just think it sucks not having it happen all at once
[1:40:28] falldrgn: so the servers are gonna shit themselves 3 days early
[1:40:29] Keyastaron_: whats up @Towelliee  hows it doing
[1:40:31] Shroomgirl81: The prob with early is that it ruins the excitement of everyone waiting for the game to launch. It’s like Christmas but u already saw your gifts.

[1:41:02] Dvalin: you need nitro for that
[1:41:03] wowbigs: Lets not beat around the bush, it's a sales strategy. It forces a customer to make a choice of buying the epic edition, or accept the fomo feeling, I have NO issue with this by the way, I've bought epic, but it's purely sales strategy, and good on them I say!

[1:51:46] xziyn: Because T11 was crazy hard and long, but yeah only three raid tiers
[1:51:47] Alaquane: that first tier was stacked
[1:51:53] DeanoTV: MoP is probs the most requested classic
[1:52:00] DeanoTV: alot of people loved MoP
[1:52:03] iamwaritzself: IF MoP Classic comes out, it should be the end...
[1:52:08] src1923: nah if they send panda email ill reject it

[1:52:16] falldrgn: maybe change the name from Classic, to Legacy or something at this point?
[1:52:16] Darkside1366: can we stop after MOP classice i dont wana see BFA or legion classic
[1:52:19] atroyabelladonna: Love MoP

[1:52:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: MoP windwalker was my favorite version of monk
[1:52:30] Effin_Steffin: Loved the Pandas, hated the expansion
[1:52:34] shinas: you think at one point they will bring back old ZG and old Ony to retails as they did with Naxx and SM
[1:52:40] Mecabeast: I think alot of the panda hate was because of how close mop released to the Kung fu panda movie
[1:52:41] DeanoTV: hopefully no WOD, that almost killed the game KEKW
[1:52:43] soflotcg: i couldnt stand panda land. thats where i quit playing for a long while
[1:52:45] BlueNile: @Darkside1366 that's their "plan" ;-D
[1:52:50] Chronollo: I loved MoP and Cata tbh
[1:52:54] Chronollo: It was after MoP that sucked
[1:53:05] ClassicMalcontent: I'm fine with them releasing ongoing Classics. If they don't roll a Wrath era realm I hope they consider, at some point, adding a Chromie Time-walking option for OG vanilla game world re-visiting in Retail. That would be sweet. I would do Retail and C+
[1:53:08] xziyn: Because it was before them lol?
[1:53:12] SamuraiWillZ916: @dunzocd Not if you were a warrior glad stance
[1:53:12] Line_0: i guess because people disliked it

[1:53:21] MILESkg21: just the last 2 fights were shit tier LuL
[1:53:50] dexxzor: i think because there was really nothing to do, no dungeons or dailies
[1:53:58] Chronollo: They should add classic/retail graphics toggle on retail @Towelliee it will make the game more nostalgic for ppl who prefer classic graphics... player/consumer psychology is very very important

[3:03:08] Kohhzee: not exactly, classic+ is more about expanding zones, dungeons/raids in the existing world and maybe rebalacing some shit classes like moonkin/ret pally. And what is most important, not a seasonal content

[3:03:52] Molvonos: @kingzerg I sent you a message on DIscord.
[3:03:55] DoRebellious: DoRebellious subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Looking up for the Classic +
[3:03:55] TheTeaPartier: you think classic will ever catch up to retail or when will they stop progressing classic
[3:03:56] lilwaldo: lilwaldo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! What is prime again Kappa ?
[3:03:59] Sollice: Ok Molv you do it
[3:04:03] Sollice: I’m eating lol
[3:04:06] Molvonos: lol
[3:04:07] LucidEhms: expecting an expansion with 5 zones for classic+ was weirid
[3:04:10] kadukarr: @Towelliee What do you think about the 90$ heroic versions 3day early access?
[3:04:13] GoldSmog: Never going to happen
[3:04:15] Rimasr: Maybe just graphics from retail to classic + wouldve been nice!
[3:04:16] Nevindaz: nah..
[3:04:16] Snabido: Adding more zones sounds like... expansions 😏
[3:04:17] Kinghorn: good
[3:04:17] kokochris: that would never happen.
[3:04:19] Kohhzee: classic+ is basically what Turtle WoW did
[3:04:20] Toon11: LUL they don't even do that for retail anymore
[3:04:23] Kinghorn: invalidate retail
[3:04:27] Nevindaz: that will be WOW 2
[3:04:27] ThorH13: I wand a discovery era not a season
[3:04:27] Kinghorn: cobaltSmug
[3:04:27] tlsmith3638: Wow: midnight will add have cross region maybe lol
[3:04:28] UnearthedSin: @ahies28 OCE is covered under NA servers, so yes.
[3:04:29] digaboom: I also don't think that's what Classic players even want
[3:04:29] notColt45: Right, it's all new instanced stuff or open world quest givers in current zones
[3:04:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Season of Discovery adds to vanilla but it doesn't replace it, true
[3:04:30] megamanx9999: Well see That's why this is such a problem because Classic + is Different for every single person
[3:04:34] digaboom: I think this is in the vein of what OSRS does
[3:04:36] Astaris: I could see them doing 1 server that starts at classic and after like 6 months goes to TBC then 6 months goes to WOTLC, etc and then just merges into the 1 primary server and restarts
[3:04:36] love_eggplant: turtle wow is much better though
[3:04:46] limburgse: I love Chris Metzen’s passion for the game!
[3:04:51] Pups_Gersky: REMINDER GUYS - Pre-release Content on your launch browsers. Get that done so you don't have to wait even longer tomorrow.
[3:04:56] TheTeaPartier: we want a murlok mmo

[3:05:00] Megadisaster24: ZF will definitely be a new 10 raid
[3:05:06] Heero_Effect: @love_eggplant  nah
[3:05:09] megamanx9999: I mean, I haven't played turtle. So I can't ge it too much of an opinion
[3:05:14] sniperpotion: Im hype for season of discovery for sure. Def what i wanted
[3:05:17] Nevindaz: Turtle wow added Gilneas city, Karazhan from TBC, and a few tiny Islands
[3:05:20] megamanx9999: But i'm laying more excited for sod
[3:05:26] Nevindaz: and Mount Hyjal map
[3:05:28] drfreckles87: when they said tank warlock in opening ceremony they clearly dont remember 3 drake sarth
[3:05:30] ahies28: Ty*
[3:05:40] herzlustafir: gz to the winner beginners luck :D
[3:05:45] megamanx9999: I much rather prefer what blizzard's doing it's not just little tweaks it's big changes
[3:05:57] lilwaldo: I need to see about getting back into wow. I haven't played since 10.0 release.
[3:05:57] megamanx9999: It is closer to ascension if anything

[4:12:46] Greencaps07: esfand was trying to kill the grp
[4:12:47] kostchie: LFR did not come out until  Dragon Soul
[4:12:50] kramurz: o/
[4:12:59] Jimbobaus: Ooooooh
[4:13:04] rivera9: they should un nerf S2 gear when s4 starts since no one care, like Beacon
[4:13:07] notColt45: LFR vs LFD is very diff
[4:13:10] Sheckly84: Just do what they did originally for LFR, just move it back one tier. Wait until Firelands and then release it.
[4:13:13] tbaile10: @rosina_scarlett dang, I just missed them getting killed, chill
[4:13:16] Bovan1243: when does the patch drop?
[4:13:22] skymercii: Classic spine @kostchie fangzFine
[4:13:23] Amarlian: People keep saying that LFD and LFR ruined the social aspect of the game. I still contend that just getting older and having less time to play in our lives had a much bigger impact. @Towelliee
[4:13:28] mavericks312: Just add LFR at launch or cata will die just like wrath did
[4:13:30] nolanfromearth: The 7th

[4:13:59] Wulfgrym: stop listening to the classic clowns, lfr and dungeon finder are good moves
[4:13:59] Krait06: Not having RDF when your server was dead was pure pain
[4:13:59] notColt45: The only issue I could see is LFR doesn't have gear for the first raids
[4:14:02] Snabido: LFR on launch gon be a bit weird, coz the raids available didnt have it
[4:14:05] Lothawia: If i wanna queue up for something let me do it, its only classic anyway not like its crazy stuff
[4:14:06] Snabido: But yes
[4:14:10] rufemannen: @MrBadaBing patch drops tomorrow, season starts at 17th i think

[4:44:23] bypized: @Towelliee 18 months expacs/
[4:44:23] blueboywiz: I thought metzen said war within was the 10th expansion
[4:44:32] Vile_: @Redpandalol "Soon," it'll be late next year lmao
[4:44:32] Heero_Effect: Metzen said they are gonna deliver story content faster, does that mean shorter time between expansion?
[4:44:33] big_litro_: hey how will the giveway work?

[4:44:52] Exosirus: I just hope Microsoft lets them be more creative now
[4:44:58] Molvonos: Uh
[4:44:58] bypized: 18 months expacs moving forward @Towelliee ?
[4:45:02] Bernardo994: well I mean story wise
[4:45:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is a season 4 it just won't have another raid
[4:45:10] Molvonos: @towelliee Someone redeemed  the Hammer Squad guild.  Unsure if you saw that.
[4:45:13] Vile_: @Redpandalol There's going to be an s4 with Fated raids, bud.
[4:45:18] Vile_: Plenty to do story-wise, too.
[4:45:21] bypized: I love it, it gives you time to collect all the stuff from the expac
[4:45:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: im going to Japan next November so it better be before that
[4:45:25] Joefoshow15: i think we are gonna start getting yearly expansions which makes sense for both parties, right?
[4:45:27] mavericks312: 4-5 months of anirdrassil 2-3 months of a fated season
[4:45:27] lumaday: brand new mythic plus rotation which will be nice
[4:45:30] JesikaPlays: fated was fun!
[4:45:33] bypized: EXACTLY
[4:45:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Molvonos he did
[4:45:35] ScrubbzTV: do you think its bad that they took away the season affix for mythic plus?
[4:45:38] Molvonos: @HaxzorJimDuggan kk
[4:45:41] segarth: @redpandalol and a fated patch so 1 year ez
[4:45:41] Shadowlemur01: Nah, fated seems cheap especially if we will be in it for 6+ months
[4:45:46] bypized: Its like the ULTIMATE CATCH UP
[4:45:47] fooxytv: I was surprised no 10.2.5 or 10.2.7 details, obviously they don't want to ruin the story for 10.2?
[4:45:50] mavericks312: Max was speaking out against the fates season that’s where the backlash is coming from
[4:45:56] sifer007: my bags are full
[4:45:59] Redpandalol: @Vile_ yeah but how long is that gonna last? 10 months is sheeeeesh
[4:46:00] illStefan: i think this will be the way they do patches and raids moving forward 3 raids and fated
[4:46:05] Molvonos: @Shadowlemur01 Fated seems cheap; doesnt recall the absolute droughts that typically happen instead.
[4:46:09] OhNoNotAgain: I just ask people, you want stale content or you want a bit of a change up and to have some fun at the end before a new expansion.
[4:46:16] Molvonos: I'd rather have fated raids than nothing at all.
[4:46:18] Darkside1366: i just hope Amrs is going to do well in M+ the Tier seems good for pvp
[4:46:23] Vile_: @Redpandalol Okay, so let's say there's 5 months of s3 and 5 months of s4. That's about normal.
[4:46:27] lolFedaz: It’s free real estate
[4:46:30] bypized: Everything about OW was pain
[4:46:34] darkh79: they should use older raids for fated instead of just the current expansion. that would be pretty cool
[4:46:44] mavericks312: @shadowlemur01 10.2 for 5-6 months then dated for 2-3 months the a little drought that usually happens
[4:46:49] ZeusDNA: I think .5 is the fated
[4:46:51] thejangoshow: Did they talk about a stat squish for 11.0 @towelliee ?
[4:46:59] Redpandalol: @Vile_ dosent mean its okay. we got a long slog till next expansion is all im saying
[4:47:05] michaelmm: They didn't do a patch for SL Season 4.
[4:47:06] Vile_: @thejangoshow They did not.
[4:47:10] Jattell: 10.2.9 maybe?
[4:47:14] Joefoshow15: @bypized didnt I hear a rank system re-work? I think that would be a W
[4:47:23] Metket: famous towelliee calender opening LUL
[4:47:28] skymercii: Chat how is fury warrior looking next patch?
[4:47:30] Vile_: @Redpandalol Okay? 10 months of two seasons of content is better than 14 months of a SINGLE RAID with no updates whatsoever.
[4:47:34] KiLLMasTer20: @towelliee what's the ilvl for world loot in 10.2
[4:47:41] big_litro_: wait what?
[4:47:41] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 10.3 is confirmed not happening
[4:47:42] notColt45: said season 4 is fated
[4:47:42] Mushythegoblin: did they say anything about what is 10.3?
[4:47:44] mavericks312: 10.3 is dated
[4:47:44] ZeusDNA: Nothing is stopping them from doing random 10.2.8 and 10.2.9 as small story patches to lead into 11.0
[4:47:46] michaelmm: Morgan said "no 10.3.0" in an interview.
[4:47:48] ErosReeves: !community
[4:47:54] thebeanspace: I'm faded bruh
[4:47:55] Tooyoo: i thought they said no 10.3, but confirmed fated.
[4:47:59] kalamari__: @KiLLMasTer20 415 greens from quests
[4:48:01] ElmSpace: Morgan explicitly said no 10.3
[4:48:01] Vile_: S4 will not be 10.3.
[4:48:02] big_litro_: didnt they say .3 is not happening??
[4:48:07] Tooyoo: so maybe 10.2.9
[4:48:08] NYKO7_: maybe 10.3 with some new story line quests and fated raids
[4:48:13] Tooyoo: Fated in shadowlands was 9.2.5
[4:48:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: 10.3 makes sense
[4:48:21] Tooyoo: Fated in shadowlands wasnt 9.3
[4:48:28] kedrius_: I bet there will be a lot of story stuff in 10.3/.5/.7
[4:48:35] michaelmm: Season 4 in Shadowlands didn't have a path number.
[4:48:35] big_litro_: there was no 9.3
[4:48:36] Zivs: did we even have a 9.3
[4:48:37] zalo_1993: no 9.2.5
[4:48:42] egraves7: there was no 9.3
[4:48:43] PojaLive: I don't think there was a 9.3
[4:48:43] KiLLMasTer20: Thanks @kalamari__
[4:48:47] KombatWombat07: fated was end of SL
[4:48:51] mavericks312: Fated in s-lands wasn’t a whole new season was it
[4:48:52] michaelmm: 9.2.5 released a few weeks after S4 started.
[4:48:56] Redpandalol: @Vile_ fated is okay but lets not make it out like its new and shiney. if you are new its great to gear up but if youve been playing its more of the same thing.
[4:49:08] valianya: 10.3 will have Epilogue storyline and bridge storyline to WW
[4:49:18] Snabido: Mr T is a stat guy, and he knows 👀
[4:49:26] blueboywiz: Which expansion had the longest drought
[4:49:27] Vile_: @Redpandalol You're entitled and welcome to that opinion, but saying "This content isn't worth having because it doesn't mean much to ME and isn't fun to ME" isn't a valid argument.
[4:49:29] cptrogers123: 1 year until next expansion Aware
[4:49:31] Joefoshow15: I think we get an August 11.0 release
[4:49:34] Vile_: Because there are loads of people who enjoy it, and who will enjoy it.
[4:49:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Alpha in the spring
[4:49:38] mavericks312: Everyone is forgetting beta as well
[4:49:44] SamuraiWillZ916: anyone know if all new 70 boosts are "enhanced" or is it just the one from the preorder?
[4:49:47] pronkk_: they did announce aplha in spring
[4:49:53] fooxytv: LuL
[4:49:54] ExtremeStorm1: Nice
[4:49:59] liviu_81: ...obviously Kappa
[4:50:00] Zivs: yeah that's gonna be rough
[4:50:06] Mushythegoblin: only beta... for the peeps that pay 90 dollar
[4:50:06] KridenTagg: Has their been an announcement yet on the CE for War Within?
[4:50:06] segarth: I’ll take it whatever it is. I don’t mind wow being a seasonal game that’s really good for half a year and I can play other games without the fomo
[4:50:08] Vile_: Yeah, Alpha's in spring 2024.
[4:50:12] Molvonos: @Redpandalol I don't think anyone's making it out to be something 'new and shiny'.  But the fact it is content, it is upgrades, it is 'new' depending on mechanics (a lot which were incredibly fun).  But hey, if you like no content whatso ever, you do you, boo.
[4:50:18] bypized: @Towelliee Drachtyr will have Dragonriding back

[4:50:35] michaelmm: Or they try to let everyone who bought it in - with only 2/3 servers! LUL
[4:50:35] Redpandalol: @Vile_ i never said its not worth having its just long and a slog for people that have been playing on a regular basis. its great for people who are coming back
[4:50:35] Joefoshow15: @SamuraiWillZ916 I would imagine so...kinda weird to make it separate
[4:50:44] kallidar: they tried it on diablo 4 and it worked..so they monetize the shit out of this
[4:50:46] PlagueHit: Well they didn’t say which beta is for preorder Kappa
[4:50:58] valianya: Doesn't the  pre purchasepage specifically say it grant Beta though?
[4:51:00] Vile_: @Redpandalol As someone who's played on a regular basis, I automatically shut this logic down.
[4:51:03] S_CoR: as usual
[4:51:08] mein8: bears are still meta for one more day
[4:51:13] ClassicMalcontent: @PlagueHit true. And that would be an 'epic' (edition) troll. Kappa
[4:51:14] lunamoogle: Sad kitty
[4:51:15] Aidler: and the footnotes (fine print) mentioned nothing about any restrictions when it comes to the beta. so it’s fair to expect everyone is on board for the first beta version

[4:51:30] Jango_: the only druid spec that has a right to complain is Feral
[4:51:31] heinekings: they got not forms LOL
[4:51:32] KombatWombat07: bears are the only druids that matter
[4:51:33] Vile_: @Redpandalol 5 months of s3 and 5 months of s4 isn't a bad spread. Just because YOU consider Fated a "slog" doesn't mean it's not fun or enjoyable for people.

[4:57:14] dschmidt: it was super clear from the other properties that it was a wowcon and not a blizzcon. The fact we got a crumb on D4 expansion was really disappointing

[4:57:23] herr_iceman: sweet

[4:58:04] davysaurus: dolly and dot are my best friends.
[4:58:28] ElroenFlyrow: This BlizzCon was lacking tho, no voice actors panel, no artists panel, no community panels, a lot of panels were missing xD I hope it is because 4 years has passed and next BlizzCon will be more full of stuff
[4:58:31] unc0de: they pull my wagon through dunes of sand
[4:58:32] dracullus: I hope 11.0 launch will be hyped up like Legion and BfA

[4:59:35] chriswrites: given the announcement of 3 expansions, i dont even know what they would announce next year
[4:59:36] ElroenFlyrow: I think at the community panel with the cosplayes, one of the devs said "Well, I should prepare a cosplay for next year". I mean it is not MUCH at all, but still... hoping blizzcon 2024

[5:01:02] Dalsonson: Honestly, I hope to god they do Blizzocn every year. It's become such a staple for the company, and honestly I think Microsoft would be willing to fund it yearly (with them getting the revenue ofc)
[5:01:05] Sereannon: 20 th anniversary
[5:01:06] xmedpakx: @ElroenFlyrow agree i missed the voice panel badly and artist panel

[5:02:09] CrunkyBrewster: they got that MS money now hehe
[5:02:11] Jattell: i thought it interesting they said the future of warcraft not world of warcraft, might we see a warcraft 4????
[5:02:12] DrJenxx: A whole year with Microsoft I feel like they could cook something up for next year.
[5:02:13] d2darkalliance: @towelliee there wont be a d1 remaster. If they dont changed their mind. They went gog route instead to have it run on modern computers and this info is from source at blizz
[5:02:13] MrBeefy78: Metzen pretty much said "Here's the next 3 years, let us cook"  I wouldn't expect much at Blizzcon from WoW next year
[5:02:14] ElroenFlyrow: @xmedpakx That woman that is charged of the voice actors, she does those panels, and she is amazing, so energetic. I really wanted voice panel. I hope she still works there
[5:02:14] Phil87z: What was the attendance like? Tickets we’re still available and demand seemed low
[5:02:14] Brodih_: did Spencer came back for something, or just these few minutes at opening?
[5:02:19] elhondro: next blizzcon wow on game pass
[5:02:21] diesekt: was hoping to hear more about that survival game
[5:02:23] Mystai: still surprised the season of discovery will release this month
[5:02:24] Dalsonson: Yea, I noticed that immediately. Microsoft 100% had a hand in the logistics of the event, even the esports arenas and shit
[5:02:32] CrunkyBrewster: Poppa Phil gonna save em
[5:02:41] TheLoneRanger2016: I would love a Diablo Movie @Towelliee
[5:02:45] BrutalHermit: It was kinda cringe watching the presenters pause for the crowds to cheer, and practically no one did LUL

[5:03:19] majixeightythree: WA that show positioning
[5:03:20] N7Spectr3: Just hearing Metzen talk about the story and what's coming had my hyped! I haven't been this hyped for the story since Legion. He is such a great storyteller!
[5:03:21] CrunkyBrewster: UH oh whut
[5:03:26] kingtmose: With Chris Metzen return and Microsoft influence. Do you think Blizzard and Metzen will try to redeem Arthas after the Shadowlands team destroyed his legacy? There is a few rumours out there.
[5:03:28] Niksen_99: People were cheering way more for retail than Classic this blizzcon
[5:03:29] honeychonker: kazarra puddles
[5:03:31] dschmidt: ooof
[5:03:36] MrBeefy78: On the positive side... We made it out of Blizzcon without con crud.
[5:03:36] valianya: Does this kill DPS meters??!
[5:03:37] honeychonker: It showed an overlay of where to go

[5:03:40] kitkatmeel: echo of nelth
[5:03:42] fewyn: yes
[5:03:44] Nokterian: no its the overlay making fights easier

Honestly best to just look forward to what Metzen is cooking up now. I swear I have been waiting for the continuation after what happened at the end of Legion.

[5:08:41] honeychonker: We needed more puzzles and fun things like Nazjatar dotted around

[5:09:00] delaine: The rares would have been fun if their HP scaled
[5:09:06] delaine: but to start with 12-15M HP sucks
[5:09:07] TurtleThumbWar: That 1 mount is impossible to get for me in Zaralek
[5:09:10] BigAng: ^
[5:09:15] ClassicMalcontent: I'm super casual in Retail and not well geared on most characters and still just went Meh to the Zerelek Caverns

[5:09:33] dapeanutbutter: press every cd: you have now tanked successfully
[5:09:41] segarth: Same with that other zone up north and the vault. Can’t even think of the name. Content lasted a week.
[5:09:45] drearysleeper: only tank with friends and guildies if you get anxiety, slowly build up doing low keys and mastering mechanics
[5:09:45] vic_ave: also depends if your group is understanding or just jerks
[5:09:46] Xeressia: Those rares have waaaay to much health to even be able to solo
[5:09:48] dead_lee_: Level up a tank, youll get the hang of it
[5:09:51] honeychonker: My advice is running with guildies, preferably with your usual tank running DPS and talking you through it
[5:09:51] elandura: I had that anxiety, powering through worked for me
[5:09:52] zacbinkz: Here's how you be confident - step 1, not give a fuck

[5:10:44] TazIsSum: its good to tank because then you realize when you go back to dps to not give the tank grief
[5:11:01] zacbinkz: you have to fail at some point. more people should try tanking and healing.
[5:11:01] MrWoodsmith: hard find a good guild since 85% guilds are dead.

[5:37:32] Kalec_Stromhir: plus 30 day game time
[5:37:37] Wulfgrym: ignitely wrong
[5:37:39] stresstest: 3days is just a Sale Pitch, it gives nothing really
[5:37:42] Rudric_Ice: tow will give free boosts after right
[5:37:43] Viduuus: If you can afford it, do it. If not then wait.
[5:37:47] neverbornlucky: Towelliee this is worse then Diablo4 early access for paying more
[5:37:50] skymercii: @seerated fangzLove
[5:37:52] fanousis: let me rephrase, why should this bonus even exist? @Towelliee
[5:37:53] Impactus_Vult: towIgnit
[5:37:54] Wulfgrym: 3 days who cares
[5:37:56] CptTeacake: The early access is awful however you slice it
[5:37:56] falldrgn: my only issue.. why are they including that in that edition only, the middle edition had early access for D4
[5:38:07] Viduuus: Hell yeah!
[5:38:09] Orczeus: i just want the toy in the Epic Edition lol
[5:38:13] Wulfgrym: yeah it is odd, but its there
[5:38:18] Keyastaron_: for all we now they could lower or increase OR EVEN REMOVE the earlyt access
[5:38:19] SYN_Intimidate: did they give a Release date for War With in?
[5:38:21] PojaLive: It's not bad for the people who would get it anyway, it's bad for the people who normally wouldn't
[5:38:21] geokouts: what was the cost of the Epic DF edition?
[5:38:21] MinivannGaming: its all FOMO
[5:38:21] Rudric_Ice: @fanousis bcuz its free money
[5:38:22] IIFOSTERII: What about the physical editions ?
[5:38:25] tempistrane: @neverbornlucky I honestly think the early access helped with the server go live.
[5:38:33] Se7enthSinn: I have no problem with it
[5:38:34] theprismtv: its just a FOMO added package
[5:38:34] falldrgn: I can see it being a good thing, spreads out the leveling a ltittle bit
[5:38:36] elhondro: yeah
[5:38:36] flookguy: I preordered epic but the early access thing just looks bad. They need to drop it
[5:38:38] REALPolarbeezy: I bought it because it has more check marks over the other 2
[5:38:41] stresstest: Heck im buying it because of the cool mount and hearthStone lol
[5:38:43] skymercii: I mean I was gonna buy the $90 epic edition regardless
[5:38:43] Amazanmartyn: True
[5:38:44] R2RHIN0: I heard its an attempt to lessen the server strain on the release
[5:38:48] denflup: yes
[5:38:48] SpidercowSD: @Towelliee Oh yeah I'll be snagging it soon just for the Beta alone
[5:38:51] JustSoMediocre: Isn't the epic the only one that comes with a month of game time?
[5:38:52] SamuraiWillZ916: cant find the guild
[5:38:53] Amazanmartyn: since bfa i think
[5:38:58] crushlemons: The easiest thing to do is if you don't like it don't buy it and wait until the early access is up.
[5:38:59] mavericks312: I think ppl don’t realize every game is doing 3 days early now
[5:39:10] Yurian33: i need more check marks
[5:39:14] Lambyyx: You've probably answered before but, do you think wow will come to game pass? How will that work with current subs I wonder
[5:39:21] IIFOSTERII: I always buy the physical copy as well for my shelf, I'll be sad if they don't have them anymore
[5:39:26] xHukk: why does the community always find a way to shit on blizz for every thing they do?  Aren't you ever happy and if not..  Find a new game to play.  JFC..
[5:39:27] Sceimoz: I hope the collector's edition comes soon.
[5:39:30] FootOfGork: I thought it was 79
[5:39:30] Heero_Effect: Maybe they thought, since d4 didn’t and sold well, they’d do it again?
[5:39:36] geokouts: 80 or 90
[5:39:38] Calphurnious: @crushlemons Yeah, we'll just beta test and smooth out the launch for the rest
[5:39:50] herr_iceman: you only be ahead of the pack in the "whale pack"
[5:39:50] A_Klimas: is that your message notification im hearing?
[5:40:05] Viduuus: It’s just business baby!
[5:40:06] crushlemons: @lambyyx I hope that gets announced at a E3 Microsoft showcase

[5:41:16] s7wede: I honestly think at this point that if Blizzard removed the 3 day head start that the majority of the people wouldn't care TBH. The other bonus content more than makes up for it

[5:43:00] Jamcal: It feels too obvious that it's the world soul, which makes me wonder if it actually is or not
[5:43:00] bendystraw77: @Amazanmartyn "World of Warcraft the War Within"
[5:43:04] Crypticasden: @Towelliee I haven't played since MoP release is now a good time to come home to World of Warcraft as Metzen said? I have been playing Destiny for past few years and have no idea what is going in WoW but looks amazing.
[5:43:08] pronkk_: i saw a reddit post saying that it could be a hot take that inside azeroth is the 5th old god instead of the titan weve learned
[5:43:12] Ziephier: in the comming expansion, Anduin may truly be fighting the battle within @Towelliee
[5:43:15] xluckydawgx: There was a pretty sold theory on reddit

[5:44:16] dead_lee_: Now it turns into speculation season lol
[5:44:19] tiejuandoemaster: why is the soul of azeroth so important? why is every villan after it? what was the jailer talking about at the end?
