[1:21:29] hahohihu: was it before armor nerf?
[1:21:31] silentswordzzzz: Do you miss playing AWC on lan in front of a crowd and do you think it will come back any time soon?
[1:22:25] gelatokush: Lan is too costly and they generate no money from it
[1:22:27] Sikaan: if there is a blizzcon why not just host a lan tourny i dont get it
[1:22:53] Razzagall: there is an insane clip about you on warcraft channel, back where lan was a thing trenLUL
[1:22:54] boblord: just host a lan 4Head
[1:22:56] genetixkappa: can you send the qtime weakaura?

[1:23:58] mehhx: justpaste.it
[1:24:03] Raikubest: https://wago.io/mJMiNwZvR
[1:24:06] DCBen: you finally got the insane displacement weakaura LUL
[1:24:14] halmz1919: ***
[1:24:16] Delxenyo: Imagine if blizzard did something back to the players instead of fucking leech and expect players to play for everything just to play in a tourney that rounds up hunderds of thousands of dollars
[1:24:31] mehhx: u can get splinters from the epic boxes too I think
[1:24:36] DCBen: i swear it can save you sometimes
[1:24:40] DCBen: maybe even in AWC
[1:24:45] mehhx: i got 1 from an epic box
[1:24:46] mehhx: 100%
[1:24:49] mehhx: the other day o nstream
[1:24:53] Sikaan: have you seen that crazy outlaw macro for focus stuff and grapple insta back
[1:25:00] Necromantico: boxes can drop it
[1:25:05] mehhx: yeah i swear they can
[1:25:05] hazexd: hi do you think they will nerf the dh soon?
[1:25:22] Srsturbocaw: are u on us rn?
[1:25:23] kebablover55555: @Delxenyo i think its last time they contriute that much money to tourney. its like laying off 4 people to hold a tourney noone watches
[1:25:28] mehhx: no
[1:25:28] mehhx: LOL
[1:25:33] mehhx: holy priest is insanely good
[1:25:34] AstralScare: LUL
[1:25:35] mehhx: tho
[1:25:41] NenyioXz: lol you won everythign as rmp in season 1 when rmp was bad aswell
[1:25:43] mehhx: and i think we would make dragon work if we played in 3v3
[1:25:47] NenyioXz: you would prolly 3-0 everything as rmp
[1:25:57] mehhx: i learned to play h oly priest today in shuffle
[1:26:00] mehhx: i had an epiphany the other day
[1:26:07] mehhx: and now my playstyle for shuffle is gg
[1:26:26] Akrololz: shuffle
[1:26:29] Akrololz: raikuPog
[1:26:41] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Raiku and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[1:26:50] mehhx: shuffle is all i play now and it requires a completely different mindset and skillset / script to play than 3s
[1:26:55] mehhx: its dogshit but it is what it is
[1:27:02] Akrololz: ye 100%
[1:27:10] DCBen: is the biggest pvp bracket @mehhx
[1:27:16] mehhx: 3s isnt rly scripted but at least as a healer u need to learn to script everything
[1:27:19] mehhx: in shuffle
[1:27:20] BongZillaTv: @mehhx shuffle to me is what killed wow pvp idk
[1:27:35] Akrololz: big skill bracket channXD  channXD  channXD
[1:27:35] lugerdh: how to get ur weak auras?
[1:27:36] BongZillaTv: the years of 3v3s and the ladder being active was so much better than this new shit
[1:27:38] kebablover55555: shuffle as healer is insanely hard. 1800 priests swding polys and other cc
[1:27:41] boltqt_: Hopefully DH gets a 50% nerf
[1:27:46] mehhx: well
[1:27:53] Zissuri14: if u are new to wow pvp. can u learn and improve by playing shuffle?
[1:28:03] Delxenyo: @Zissuri14 ofc you can
[1:28:05] korgare: My brother just came in and told me the Arcanite Ripper is a drop now?
[1:28:11] korgare: Hear anything about that?
[1:28:12] mehhx: i will always liev that long in 3s
[1:28:16] mehhx: i swear its easy tot live as dragon
[1:28:19] mehhx: u just play freedom
[1:28:21] asdkl2312k3o: @mehhx true
[1:28:22] NenyioXz: you underestimate mehh
[1:28:34] asdkl2312k3o: dragon has easier time healing themselves
[1:28:34] mehhx: in shuffle its difficult tho
[1:28:44] mehhx: i said it before but i feel like on dragon once u hit 40% ish damp and higher and u get trained
[1:28:55] mehhx: or dont even get trained but get hit a bit so that ur mastery becomes redudant
[1:28:58] mehhx: thats when it becomes hard to play
[1:29:04] hahohihu: Dragon would be hard vs rogues and shamans I think. the cc, knocks and roots makes it unplayable for me at least
[1:29:08] Zissuri14: @Delxenyo thanks, that means im just dogshit healer. :D
[1:29:16] asdkl2312k3o: yeh, if u hit dragon and others making mast useless its hard
[1:30:13] mehhx: like the 3v3 ive played dragon just feels like its on godmode cus its easy to keep ur mastery up
[1:30:23] mehhx: more coordinated gameplay and obv  no ramping damp the same way
[1:30:31] mehhx: and communion is a godly cooldown in 3s but in shuffle its kinda shit
[1:30:34] mehhx: cus its useless above 50% damp
[1:30:39] mehhx: well not useless but pretty shit
[1:30:50] despised1: @Raikubest You didn't play old cleanse build vs lock last 2 games.
[1:31:34] mehhx: oh but
[1:31:36] mehhx: mastery always works on urself
[1:31:42] asdkl2312k3o: ye
[1:31:44] mehhx: the problem in shuffle is that u get tunneled but ur team gets mega cleaved the same time
[1:31:47] mehhx: and u have ramping damp
[1:31:53] mehhx: so ur teammates die
[1:31:58] mehhx: cus ur low aswell and u cant heal them
[1:32:00] asdkl2312k3o: ^
[1:32:02] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Raiku and enter code: ECHO
[1:32:26] mehhx: and even if u dont get tunneled in shuffle because of the way the class heals with verdant u will always get cleaved a little bit, and once u get cleaved and u hit high damp
[1:32:31] mehhx: ur mastery wont keep ur teammates alive anymore
[1:33:14] asdkl2312k3o: imagine having that mastery on any other healer t han pres
[1:33:17] asdkl2312k3o: insane
[1:33:35] mehhx: im not sure if i agree with that
[1:33:36] mehhx: but maybe
[1:33:43] mehhx: id need to play myself to see how it works
[1:33:50] mehhx: oh b ut ww sub u would never play evoker against LOL
[1:33:54] mehhx: that would be suicide
[1:34:00] tinderx: @mehhx come rbg
[1:34:18] mehhx: @asdkl2312k3o yup imagine that as hpriest mastery
[1:34:18] asdkl2312k3o: @mehhx yes cuz those swaps will fk with u too
[1:34:38] asdkl2312k3o: would be  insane KEKW

[1:44:06] snulli: is Whaazz going to play warrior on AWC or still just playing rogue?
[1:44:06] LilDeanix: facing so many r1 at 2.4 trying for glad wins lol
[1:44:09] elswavee: they will never buff mmr i swear
[1:44:19] elswavee: and they do it every ssn it just ruins the start of every snn
[1:44:45] elswavee: and the lower rated players just spam vs r1s and they get demotivated
[1:44:54] simstarx: yea that's so bad, I didn't play season 2 because I noticed first week shuffle MMR was different and didn't feel rewarding. Has it been the same since s2 start?
[1:45:13] Akrololz: channXD
[1:45:15] boltqt_: What do you think mmr should be at
[1:45:16] snulli: so how is the mmr now? is it impossible for regular players to get glad?
[1:45:20] simstarx: Season 1 MMR was fun, you could easily go 200 mmr up or down
[1:45:21] Antiquasar: haha
[1:45:21] KeremerdirDesign: did you win eu awc ?
[1:45:29] vothros: maybe even worse cuz u dont choose ur teammates in shuffle
[1:45:42] aod0311x: !armory

[1:46:24] Natan_Ntn: how they gonna manage the ping issue?

[2:23:51] notMyk: why would rating have a cap
[2:23:52] asdkl2312k3o: KEKW
[2:23:56] notMyk: makes negative sense
[2:24:07] virth123: i think they have to change M+ also, its key deplete give them 0rating.... than they will understand PVP players problem
[2:24:10] DCBen: because blizzard cant make a good system otherwise
[2:24:11] vothros: how much do you think they should pump mmr for?

[2:24:14] raven1103: What I find annoying is there is no feedback what so ever like atleast it would be something if they just wrote " "we won't"

[2:25:17] asdkl2312k3o: did u do review of cup 1 and 2, why u didnt win with the best roster by far?
[2:25:18] grris: they could just add flat MMR to everyone again aswell
[2:25:23] grris: and leave the algo alone
[2:25:24] tastyyyyy: @SizeFPS where can we see it
[2:25:25] iamreallyafan: I really don't understand why they wait tho, they want rarity on rating ????
