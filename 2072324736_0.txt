[5:26:51] BlakeFlair: probably hoping they lost so they didnt have to dq
[5:26:55] SinstoneRelics: if a team asks about a strat & are told they cant do it, why aren’t all teams informed?
[5:27:32] SinstoneRelics: in advance i mean
[5:27:35] sarkOpharg: @SinstoneRelics Then 1 team would have wasted their time figuring that strat out and the rest gets it for free
[5:27:47] Zircons: are we gonna see some more AD cooking
[5:28:18] SinstoneRelics: @sarkopharg i mean specifically when it’s disallowed
[5:29:40] sarkOpharg: @SinstoneRelics I understand that, but you need time to figure it out and they want that time to be equal for all teams. You also might also be able to adapt the strat and if another team hasn't figured it out, that would be an advantage
[5:30:27] SinstoneRelics: @sarkopharg I don’t think u understand my point. If it’s disallowed, no one is wasting time learning it
[5:30:57] SinstoneRelics: it’s like having rules to a game & not everyone knows which rules will disqualify u. it’s unfair
[5:31:54] sarkOpharg: @SinstoneRelics But figuring it out is part of your time. Everyone has to figure it out in their own time and not "give away" their time to other teams.
[5:32:44] SinstoneRelics: you’re not giving away a strat that’s disallowed xd I don’t think u understand it’s ok
[5:33:17] flawlesslykun: o7

[5:38:41] flawlesslykun: THE BIG FULLSCREEN
[5:40:43] smgBanzai: <3
[5:41:17] flawlesslykun: @Crystallize007 idk if u can elaborate on the oom situation, but the reason why i mentioned the trash pull onto the totem boss, is because of both the aoe from boss, and the venom casts from the trash mobs. i figure spamming flash heals as a "oh shit" button might've caused zhatzi to go oom but i don't play disc so
[5:43:16] pnavara: shaman xd
[5:43:31] Crystallize007: disc just doesn't use mana in keys unless you're doing turbo weird shit with your globals
