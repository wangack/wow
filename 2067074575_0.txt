[7:12:50] sir_skaeg: there isnt room in my mouth for them hence why they are getting removed, 2 of them ended up cracking entirely
[7:12:50] ZevisAu: you should get the one coming out out though. because if it grows and doesnt have teeth on the other side to keep it down it keeps growing (what my dentist said to me)
[7:12:55] Jake96: youll need to get it out if youre gum has opened and you can see the tooth
[7:12:56] acidfive23: well aslong as they dont hurt right?
[7:13:02] ZevisAu: then when you are 60 they like become massive teeth that just keep growing up :P
