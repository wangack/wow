[4:04:35] fake_rubrub: what about the 2 handed vs dualwield thing blizz is about to do. opinion?
[4:05:02] Zonnis: Healing SS is enough to make me reroll dps so i can brainlessly cleave everything
[4:05:19] MaybeRespect: If DH and Rogue get nerfs, expect to see no melee.
[4:05:28] verii: i mean they are needed but will they do it idk
[4:05:34] ripinpeace10: rsham is great why would u want pres buffs?

[4:18:31] Poopiepants: Or just lower damage
[4:18:46] drbonghitmd: a hot on wog sounds like a good idea
[4:19:04] drbonghitmd: or even making wog JUST a big hot only
[4:19:28] flaccidx: not every one has rogue AND dh damage in one comp!
[4:19:49] dooshken: destruction warlocks and DH absolutely destroy outside CDs. Makes it sad going back to classes that do nothing without CDs
[4:19:50] ripinpeace10: beacon only heals for 3% on retial but classic and wotlk 100% when did that change

[4:54:50] ChumpSeason: i'll take literally ANY dh nerf lol
[4:55:06] younotmytwin: @dooshken Yeah I had a Druid buddy tell me it today idk
[4:55:14] ripinpeace10: lol they should tho its dumb
[4:55:21] younotmytwin: I didnâ€™t even realize who was healing you lolol
[4:55:42] spujetti: does clone cost mana for boomy/feral?
[4:55:42] younotmytwin: Dh nerfs inc for sure lmao
[4:55:49] younotmytwin: Same with destro lock
[4:56:28] ChumpSeason: if druids couldn't stealth drink they'd be a lot easier to balance
[4:57:28] spujetti: idk how they would even change stealth drinking without completely killing shadowmeld entirely
[4:58:27] walozdle: i think you answered your question there
[4:58:48] FoxiekittenWoW: @spujetti most classes doesnÂ´t use meld to drink
[4:59:05] ChumpSeason: @spujetti yeah meld is still a very popular racial for lots of classes
[4:59:57] spujetti: meld is crazy good in pve too. if they change meld just because druids can stealth drink that would be tragic imo

[5:00:26] ChumpSeason: @spujetti they dont have to change meld. just make it so where you cant drink in stealth.
[5:00:37] FoxiekittenWoW: @spujetti they dont have to change meld? they could just make it so you are not allowed to drink 5-10 after to press meld.
[5:00:40] D_E_I: all they would need to do is make it so stealth ends drinking though? I must be missing something

[5:00:57] shiefen: I wonder if disc gets some love with buffs
[5:01:15] Landrysdad: I think Iâ€™ve come up with a simple Hpal fix, but idk if itâ€™s op. Delete light of dawn as a cone heal and have it turn judgement into an AOE heal similar to melee wings just not as strong. Makes judgement worth pushing and make LoD no a useless talent
[5:02:12] Thell: And DH doesn't need a billion binds
[5:02:34] ChumpSeason: i want to see the armor changes unnerfed
[5:02:46] Landrysdad: The absorb feels useless and through put is hpals biggest issue imo.
