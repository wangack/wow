[0:12:47] DanteDemonZ: vengeance dps too good
[0:12:47] ShaggySummers: and then there's 4 more players
[0:12:56] tettles: donki
[0:13:08] skippy295: HI
[0:13:16] tettles: banditos looked rlly good
[0:13:20] tettles: mandatory looked inconsistent
[0:13:21] burne114: I think you're looking the best, bb
[0:13:33] protoss_olympian: Whats the prize for mdi
[0:13:39] hdott52: donki
[0:13:40] MBG_95: Bandits looked solid but not crazy fast
[0:13:43] ShaggySummers: @protoss_olympian acceptance and street cred
[0:13:46] tettles: they had mid pack reset in AD too which isnt awesome
[0:13:54] Nuublet: INCONCSISTENT, BECAUSE THEY GOT A DQ? :P
[0:13:56] Lottinius: baldbois
[0:13:57] burne114: @tettles They were consistently cheating though, according you you, official WoW caster
[0:13:57] Nuublet: caps sry
[0:13:59] kibaha: what happened to mandatory? what reset? i missed yesterdays stream Sadge
[0:14:18] MBG_95: @Nuublet they also were sloppy in the Atal
[0:14:27] coldhitsnow: yo yo yo
[0:14:33] Nuublet: based ashine
[0:14:49] tettles: well they "fixed" snapping in AD. The mobs dont really snap unless you do it like perfectly
[0:14:54] tettles: so im not surprised
[0:14:55] Harleybane: only thing that should be snapped then is those fucking complainers about stuff that happens in mdi. literally 0.0000000000000001% ppl are affected
[0:15:00] protoss_olympian: Imagine having to admin these yappers you cant win
[0:15:15] Blloood: idk why people moan about blizz not allowing snapping
[0:15:21] Blloood: its clearly abusing mechanics/bugs
[0:15:33] tettles: you have to like sigil / combat 100% of the mobs while not getting meleed by them
[0:15:36] tettles: and then jump down immediately
[0:15:47] tettles: and if they leap / hit you while youre falling they can also reset
[0:16:04] hdott52: echo and ank tech
[0:16:17] lynxie26: does the plagueborer stream
[0:16:18] Lottinius: should just allow everything
[0:16:25] Lottinius: i wanna see some wild shit
[0:16:29] Blloood: its not a strat
[0:16:30] sky1___: Wtf mandatory did to lose that dht?
[0:16:30] Milano___: @lynxie26 LUL
[0:16:31] theskot: i think if it was a real wall in the game people would realize that dht boss thing was probably a fine dq. for consistency

[0:16:37] Blloood: its abusing bugs
[0:16:38] FraudXill: can someone tell me what mandatory did yesterday that lost them a map? like what strat was it what did it do i didnt catch it
[0:16:49] anxxylock: YOOOO chat yo dork
[0:17:03] Linith_Heart: feel like they like strats in mdi but dont want anything to carry over to live
[0:17:12] dimsy__: HI ALO

[0:17:24] anxxylock: HI
[0:17:28] burne114: Did you ask if it was okay to put the key in at the start of the dungeon? That's a biiig strat
[0:17:36] MBG_95: It's a out 1:50 into their run you can see it
[0:17:37] ShaggySummers: "yo admin, is it aight if we don't actually train for most of these?" :>
[0:17:45] Sylwevrin: Sylwevrin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:17:53] burne114: @tettles DIdn't dorki say they specifically disallowed the strat mandatory didnt ask about though
[0:18:00] hdott52: bliz dont allow you to go past walls with pets to pull things anymore
[0:18:02] theskot: pulling stuff ahead of bosses that clearly gate the dungeon has always been a no no right
[0:18:06] anxxylock: Hellowo
[0:18:07] mattyzees: didnt that shit just happen in mists in shadlowlands, through the walls
[0:18:17] LifeofSlayer77: @anxxylock Hellowo
[0:18:17] tobbs94: imagine this rule was in for mists dungeon LUL
[0:18:29] tobbs94: you only pulled through walls

[0:18:47] magikadehex_: tittle tattle tettles
[0:18:53] MBG_95: They normally only care when it's beyond a boss wall
[0:19:01] sky1___: Awkward
[0:19:04] EzzLyfe: but is this rather normal strat suddenly not ok?
[0:19:06] toique: why was is it allowed in mists of tirna ??
[0:19:06] FraudXill: but cant you just pull it before starting the boss?
[0:19:06] Nuublet: its odd here because you can run past and "progress the dungeon" if you dont pull the boss
[0:19:10] tettles: they didnt want zulgamux pulled through the wall even though it is a common strat as well
[0:19:11] excalberx3: we saw that with the train dungeon the TGP pulling things through the wall

[0:19:31] MBG_95: @ezzlyfe it's normal to pull before the boss is pulled
[0:19:40] brewtality21: why aren’t you guys NAs last hope anymore
[0:19:43] uniqueusername7: this is completely different

[0:19:52] juno_sha: juno_sha subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! It's been 30 years Dancy
[0:19:55] tettles: that rule is typically to stop people going out of bounds and stuff, but imo it's reaching a bit far
[0:20:01] nayrcraig: It was an issue with the guys after tree boss in Algethar IIRC
[0:20:04] macx23_: macx23_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[0:20:05] ShaggySummers: @brewtality21 all hope was lost for NA
[0:20:08] hdott52: HOLY jonu
[0:20:10] uniqueusername7: the wall only exists as a boss arena, its not a door that blocks progress.  you are perfectly free to walk past first boss and go play other trash or bosses
[0:20:14] lynxie26: 30 years just like donki
[0:20:15] splashz0r: are they doing lower or upper bracket first?
[0:20:19] cuzdabs: cuzdabs subscribed with Prime. 
[0:20:23] mattyzees: i dont get why they allowed mists its legit the same thing
[0:20:25] MBG_95: That was fine because you could physically get there
[0:20:28] juno_sha: Always simp for donki
[0:20:28] UphillCartwheel69: the mist pulls might be allowed since you are past the maze when you pull it into boss
[0:20:28] hdott52: @splashz0r upper
[0:20:48] Vareska11: Mandatory cheater or what?
[0:20:48] TheRealTarrjue: Jump, jump jump, jump around
[0:20:58] anxxylock: Bedge lame
[0:21:05] zero808pt: Am I seeing correctly or Sloth didn't kill the last boss of DHT on round 2, and they still won?
[0:21:12] MBG_95: Trinkets were always good
[0:21:17] pricebanana: Dorki looking handsome today
[0:21:19] FraudXill: so then TOJS could i as a DH jump up on the wall at begning and pull the 2. boss room mobs for the start is that allowed?
[0:21:20] MBG_95: Nymues does it this season
[0:21:21] ZatharahTV: codex from gambit
[0:21:22] ohlittlebrain: that reflective trinket
[0:21:26] juno_sha: I feel like pulling through walls feels like a skill expression?
[0:21:26] lynxie26: mw faeline stomp used to be able to go thru so many weird walls
[0:21:26] ohlittlebrain: from taz
[0:21:28] wraghelm: imagine if someone pulled out that nymue trinket broken tech from a while ago
[0:21:29] KozmoWoW: the toy
[0:21:29] hdott52: @zero808pt mandatory got dq for that map
[0:21:32] anxxylock: jonu
[0:21:36] juno_sha: jonu
[0:21:37] TheRealTarrjue: @dorki do you think growl will find a way to piss off the echo community again this season?
[0:21:40] Azekial: Arent people using immo aura in AD to pull stuff into volkaal?
[0:21:41] anxxylock: KEKW thdBrow
[0:21:42] craigward: What if its not intended?
[0:21:45] zero808pt: @anxxylock wtfm why?
[0:21:47] Yaebad: @TheRealTarrjue LUL
[0:21:49] Linith_Heart: pulling the bats on to 3rd boss in dht seems sus to me if dryad pull is banned
[0:21:52] ZatharahTV: WAIT there was a dq
[0:21:53] MBG_95: Yo wasn't SMBG 2nd boss pulling through walls?
[0:21:55] protoss_olympian: Why is blizzard deathly afraid of jank
[0:21:57] MBG_95: The extra packs
[0:21:58] tobbs94: man they should bring back the torghast anima seasonal affix, but just make the anima powers more cool
[0:22:00] LudganTV: LudganTV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Ggs Dorki giga chad
[0:22:01] ZatharahTV: I MISSED yesterday
[0:22:11] stiknork: doesnt the wall go down before dht first boss? we pull those flowers into boss on our push route no pets
[0:22:12] anxxylock: this whole convo is dumb let everything be allowed
[0:22:16] anxxylock: Shrugeg
[0:22:20] wraghelm: and they technically pulled it before bc they sheeped it
[0:22:21] anxxylock: Shruge
[0:22:23] The_Loony_Bin: that rule only applies to linear dungeons tho
[0:22:27] sky1___: Shruge
[0:22:30] jujumann35: can you share the map pool for every game plz?
[0:22:34] juno_sha: @anxxylock Would you let THIS be allowed?
[0:22:39] litagood: so the pull in dht is leagal if they run and get the pack before they pull the boss and makes sure it is in the room
[0:22:42] moodsen: JB is so right with his tweet .... "did u get banned on live for this? no! GO FOR IT"!

[0:23:25] anxxylock: Dancy
[0:23:27] roxiee95: allowed?
[0:23:28] kingcrow730: They've also operated on "could a player accidentally do this on live servers" to determine if something is allowed for a while

[0:25:45] Harleybane: dorki, can you do the entire MDI stream and replace every word with nugget?
[0:25:51] jbenson444: do they do the upper bracket first today or the lower bracket?
[0:26:16] wraghelm: how is the DHT thing not allowed but you can scale the wall in the second boss and go get stuff from upstairs
[0:26:25] lynxie26: I miss when we could get insane crazy tech for mdi
[0:26:27] IronboyEuw: @wraghelm they didn't get it confirmed
[0:26:29] MBG_95: both Perplexed & Eclipse yday banned DHT, so this is fully new bans for them
[0:26:35] Scoops__: the one phase last boss with bald bandits was sick
[0:26:47] IronboyEuw: @wraghelm you have to get stuff confirmed with a gm before doing it, its the one and only rule rly
[0:27:02] TheRealTarrjue: Are you guys apprehensive about tech being revealed in throne in the LB finals (or wherever its map one)?
[0:27:04] wraghelm: I know they didn’t get it approved but it’s insane that jumping the boss wall is fine but pulling through it isn’t
[0:27:23] IronboyEuw: @wraghelm it is fine tho, they just didn't tell a gm about it so it wasn't allowed
[0:27:24] Ayije: bro?

[0:35:20] Yurian33: Altered Time discord

[0:35:24] mexnaq: twitch.tv/hopefulx
[0:35:25] ahmmagad: I think you should play what look fun, and worry about meta classes once you reach that level. you can easily time any 20 key with any class. going forward if you want to push and get better, thats when you worry about meta.
[0:35:26] DanteDemonZ: @Itskrugs wowhead guide is good, class discord also good, we have a channel dedicated to helping fire :)
[0:35:38] dharmist_2: when does Last Hope compete again...sorry for asking
[0:35:38] fuenchi: @Itskrugs mage-hub is bis
[0:35:39] Gnolde: the problem wasn't that they did, it was that they didn't send that to the admins beforehand, right? at least they would have known, taht it wasn't allowed then

[0:37:03] moodsen: mandatory really need a class in mdi rules ... they already fucked up the sign up :D
[0:37:05] wraghelm: are you doing a co-stream?
[0:37:11] wraghelm: or Watch party
[0:37:12] BruceBanner326: you should make that a command or something
[0:37:18] LexiSaberX: who is this mystery admin? and why is it Ion Kappa
[0:37:20] Emm_Zee: peat
[0:37:21] alkhean: so if mists comes back wall pulling wont be allowed and everyone has to do 1 room at a time in maze? Fuck Blizzard....
[0:37:23] hivplus__: Bedge
[0:37:26] Finfen: I found it kinda weird that so many people had this sentiment that it was BS that they got the map loss. Like rules the rules.
[0:37:28] sakura_2020: lol why is KEKW feetjam
[0:37:31] Gnolde: so somewhere out there is an admin, that knows all abaout echos secret techs?
[0:37:36] alkhean: gonne be massive ResidentSleeper MDI then with Mists
[0:38:13] yujik46: We just gotta find that admin and kidnap him so last hope can win globals Pog
[0:38:13] juno_sha: leak it
[0:38:14] alkhean: @Finfen well it is weird because everyone did it in mists even in 15 keys. Same strat 1:1
[0:38:15] gutz101: would you prefer it that way ?
[0:38:15] dimsy__: YEP
[0:38:16] Lottinius: LEAKS
[0:38:20] wraghelm: SHOW US
[0:38:20] Finfen: @Gnolde yap, rules are they need to clear pretty much all strats that aren't just, "move and pull"
[0:38:27] guineverenol: how do the admin decide whats legal?
[0:38:31] juno_sha: whip it out
[0:38:36] dimsy__: do it on live Looking
[0:38:44] Theliahh: whip it out
[0:38:44] Finfen: @alkhean The point is, that stuff has to be approved by admins, they clearly either didn't clear it, or did it anyways.
[0:38:45] EzzLyfe: @guineverenol they just do
[0:38:45] mexnaq: @guineverenol coin flip
[0:38:50] Thowarr: @dorki Didn't Sloth do that as well but sent their healer to pull it? You can see that on the VOD at 2:07:00 mark. So healer ok, but pet not ok?
[0:39:03] LifeofSlayer77: so wut happens when a team doesnt disclose their strat nd just plays it during the match?
[0:39:10] juno_sha: @Theliahh :b
[0:39:12] moodsen: holy
[0:39:12] Lottinius: bruh wat
[0:39:12] Finfen: @LifeofSlayer77 map loss
[0:39:14] yujik46: @Thowarr sending a pet through and wall and a healer pulling before boss engaged is very different
[0:39:17] wraghelm: then they get DQ'd
[0:39:17] hashtagnothankyou: what

[0:39:39] gutz101: dorki would you rather have free rain on routes or do you think disclosing them makes it better
[0:39:40] TheRealTarrjue: @dorki do you guys have the jpc tech for throne where the third boss doesn't melee the tank (allegedly)?

[0:55:37] bergy101: BASED admin
[0:55:47] Lottinius: because it shapes the retail meta and makes shit toxic af
[0:55:54] Theliahh: @Crytikul "since 9.0" it was literally during that patch
[0:55:55] othernewname: its easy, they dont want to make the wow balance team look stupid
[0:56:05] Tarthris: it's so they don't have to balance as well
[0:56:14] stiknork: everything should be allowed as long as its not dropping a healer
[0:56:19] Milano___: that's kind of hypocritical when he's also negative about 4 dps being possible
[0:56:31] Lottinius: Oldge2

[0:56:55] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: @crytikul knowingly abusing bugs still not ok.
[0:56:56] Niroggo: GIGACHAD
[0:56:57] bareuheldig: Every group should include all roles then, including support.
[0:57:00] Cervantas: 4 dps is diversity since you always run a healer

[0:57:48] YoungPingu: BLACK ROOK HOLD WIDEPOGGIES
[0:57:50] Gallaive: he wants class stacking though so isnt he against diversity/.
[0:57:53] kuxufipi: but loosing healer as a rule means only 33% of roles are gone
[0:57:55] iggybrew: afternoon bro
[0:57:59] oSkgaming: yo guys let me cook... deadmines... as m+?
[0:58:04] adleydarling: restriction makes people be diverse tho
[0:58:15] Sheldorrthegreatt: it’s okay JB I still think healer is a class/role don’t let the haters win 😂
[0:58:21] adleydarling: and makes you have to be creative and more out of the box
[0:58:26] Yelolyayla: Saying 1/3/1 locked in is more diversity than having the choice to do 1/4 or 1/3/1 is the small brain take imo :D
[0:58:26] bareuheldig: @kuxufipi 25. 4 roles in the game
[0:58:28] magic_mac: @kuxufipi or its a 50% increase from 2 roles to 3. Just another way of looking at it.
[0:58:47] sky1___: go ayjie

[6:06:37] jahib: Orcas hunt Great White sharks just for the liver of Great white sharks

[6:07:11] Anakil_Brusbora: they transmit knowledge to their children so they are smarter than a lot of animals
[6:07:16] HollowCheese: only recorded kills are captive orcas killing captors is it not?

[6:13:52] Emm_Zee: @Cruzerthebruzer Can't pull a dryad through a wall but can pull a riftmage through spacetime ICANT
[6:14:15] Cruzerthebruzer: @Emm_Zee also true LMAO
[6:14:25] chronicgrief: so true
[6:14:51] Emm_Zee: Can't wait for Last Hope to get farmed by that pull xdd
[6:15:38] minglium: no way this is approved start
[6:15:44] handcannon77: bro the admin is fucking giga cooked if he allows echo's pull in rise, and this pull...but not pulling dryad into 1st boss DHT(literally a common live key pull)
[6:15:45] minglium: strat
[6:16:33] AndyLaarkin: @handcannon77 rules are rules
[6:16:35] x_sight_x: chat is thre asuna elesmir nerf ... team in this tour?
[6:16:36] chronicgrief: we pulled through all the walls in mists
[6:16:55] Cruzerthebruzer: and that was approved?
[6:17:02] hivplus__: Loading
[6:17:08] Nuublet: how is that approved??????
[6:17:09] Ontarin92: become nonverbal 变得非语言 tiger paw incident 虎掌事件 ambition dissolves 野心解散
[6:17:10] handcannon77: @AndyLaarkin yeah but...not when the rules make absolutely zero sense and seem completely inconsistent
[6:17:11] Cruzerthebruzer: NonVerbal
[6:17:16] chronicgrief: @AndyLaarkin problem is the rules are inconsistent and then inconsistently enforced
[6:17:17] krona: its a good pull but uuuh
[6:17:19] Not_aFox: Loading
[6:17:32] clavish_: nerf's brother was taking up too much time on the bnet account

[6:17:57] overmancffc: @Ontarin92 what is this ?>'
[6:18:03] UnlimitedBytes: You DH/Evoker jump over the walls
[6:18:23] UnlimitedBytes: However this is pre approved because they do it without fighting the boss which is not as effective
[6:18:37] handcannon77: what they do in that pull is literally the exact reason why they DQ'd the dryad DHT pull
[6:18:40] chronicgrief: plagueborers were the worst imo
[6:18:46] kaysiix: plagueborers LVL type shit
[6:18:51] Flipeled: @dorki DH and evoker just glide jumping up
[6:19:00] Nightbot: dorkiCheer Subscribe to my YouTube channel! @ https://www.youtube.com/c/Dorki
[6:19:15] UnlimitedBytes: @handcannon77 Not entirely as this is apporved because they delay boss fight until mobs join
[6:19:52] catgay13: people also thought totem stuff werent allowed in brh
[6:19:57] Emm_Zee: @UnlimitedBytes What about pulling the boss before the miniboss is killed? That sounds very suspicious
[6:20:02] catgay13: brackenhide *
[6:20:07] UnlimitedBytes: "it is an approved strat we have confirmation"
[6:20:08] tsoukalos95: DRATTY
[6:20:14] handcannon77: @UnlimitedBytes ??? using their own logic and rules there is absolutely no way this is allowed, and if they do say its allowed then the Admin is completely clueless and inconsistent with applying rules
[6:20:14] Kappasoqt: DRATTY
[6:20:30] Cruzerthebruzer: They have to have not known lmao
[6:20:40] engelrift: just tuning in, what are they talking about?

[6:20:53] kaysiix: i am sure ECHO thought of this start but thought it was too big cheat that it wasn't even worth asking for LUL
[6:21:03] Kappasoqt: MONKA I missed what happened
[6:21:04] Nuublet: guess you are sitting in brh for two weeks dorki
[6:21:06] dizneylol: Admin team is COOKED
[6:21:07] kaysiix: strat*
[6:21:13] handcannon77: im sorry but this admin needs to be fucking removed, theyre completely awful
[6:21:25] handcannon77: but they did pull the boss b4 all the mobs were in the boss arena
[6:21:46] Kappasoqt: YEP anal
[6:21:46] Ontarin92: HUH
[6:21:52] harold_whittles: anal? HUH
[6:22:15] Gnolde: HUH
[6:22:16] harold_whittles: it makes previous decisions not fai
[6:22:18] UnlimitedBytes: @handcannon77 Well if you look at the DHT from today (don't remember which) a  team did the pull which disqualified mandatory but they did it before pulling boss and did not get disqualified
[6:22:21] handcannon77: ok then fuck blizz
[6:22:25] Emm_Zee: Who is blizzard? ICANT
[6:23:09] chronicgrief: god damnit xyro
[6:23:13] atticusfinch99: Wouldn't MDI be so much more fun if they let them do anything the fuck they want
[6:23:13] hayuri4: Dammit blizzardman RAGEY
[6:23:15] handcannon77: @UnlimitedBytes yeah and that is stupid as hell, theres no reason why it should matter if you pull it b4 or after you pull the boss
[6:23:29] goesidd: get healingstat on poddyc
[6:23:48] chronicgrief: furious
[6:23:51] chronicgrief: lol

[6:24:04] BallenitaSploosh: he will be fucking ????
[6:24:06] engelrift: wit mandatory could DQd? Where the fuck do they put this info? It's not on the wow twitter
[6:24:06] handcannon77: mandatory is prob hella pissed, theyre sitting there coming up with blizzard conspiracy theories against them
[6:24:07] goesidd: huh
[6:24:08] harold_whittles: but the didn't let everyone do crazy shit
[6:24:17] tsoukalos95: BASED

[6:24:53] marcofellipe69: Bedge such a good nap
[6:25:00] UnlimitedBytes: @handcannon77 That's right but according to the rules the one is allowed and the other not. I completely dislike this too but thats what the admins say
[6:25:45] burne114: tank movement
[6:25:51] handcannon77: @UnlimitedBytes yeah but according to the rules the BRH pull should not be allowed because of the forward progress rule...youre not supposed to be able to reach those mobs until you kill the 2nd boss
[6:27:18] Cruzerthebruzer: It's really bad
[6:27:30] Cruzerthebruzer: The portal tech is not cool even with the tech
[6:27:34] Cruzerthebruzer: the portals aren't cool*

[6:29:40] hayuri4: KEKW Looking
[6:29:46] timmayb166: wait they’re not doing echo Strat?
[6:30:10] kaysiix: nop
[6:30:13] UnlimitedBytes: @handcannon77 The rule reads "Teams cannot pull mobs or bosses that are locked beyond dungeon progression or out-of-bounds areas unless the player is able to physically get in line-of-sight and range of the mob. Any such strategy must be approved by a Tournament Admin before use. "
[6:30:19] Emm_Zee: Playing a VDH, threat is very well still a mechanic xdd
[6:30:35] UnlimitedBytes: @handcannon77 So if you can get in LOS of the mobs it's allowed due to the exact wording.
[6:31:31] Emm_Zee: @UnlimitedBytes So if mandatory did the same pull, but with like for example double transcendence, would that be fine? I wonder
[6:31:40] goesidd: Legion TD 2?
[6:32:03] trustnoonester: eclipse tech coming in
[6:32:53] Mephereon: i refuse to acknowledge the existence of diablo immortal

[6:34:25] Mephereon: the door has rng!? XD
[6:34:25] kaysiix: He can go first to start RP but he doesn't get into combat or anything
[6:34:33] Emm_Zee: AINTNOWAY surely it's not 18 seconds
[6:34:38] Shaians: why do they even have this in game?
[6:34:41] Emm_Zee: That is match defining
[6:35:11] Emm_Zee: Oh okay xdd
[6:35:27] timmayb166: you and jb talking at same time went hard
[6:35:31] jonpelf: how could they not anticipate that? literally both previous megas were made into m+
[6:35:35] Mephereon: @dorki so the mdi seed always has the same time for the door=
[6:35:49] sobeman1: tazavash was pretty goodf

[6:36:13] trustnoonester: come on now are trolling hahahaha
[6:36:52] Gnolde: come on now just knows it's over...so they tried to kill each other with orbs while runnning over xD
[6:37:19] catgay13: sometimes RP does give room for unconventional stuff like swapping talents/gear, utilizing downtime in other ways
[6:37:30] catgay13: Sadge
[6:37:31] Emm_Zee: Gambit was goated
[6:37:37] kaysiix: FUCK KARA
