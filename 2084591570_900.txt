[2:06:39] Coltynx: Yeeeee
[2:07:20] Coltynx: good answer :D ty
[2:07:26] PapitoFred: BFA and Legion were amazing stream contents here : )
[2:07:36] PapitoFred: (not saying other expansions arent but other expansions have been DOGSHIT)

[2:08:22] Hojadin: Thoughts on Hpal now?
[2:08:29] PapitoFred: Okay so I HAAAATED corruption system BUT it was amazing content from your stream when you were mixing up the gushing wounds on hpala fucking obliterating people KEKW
[2:08:54] DlABLO4: have you noticed a change in audience after creating other content? I've always enjoyed watching you play WoW so the other thing isn't for me, but think it might draw more viewers in? Idk
[2:09:06] Coltynx: Idk if they know how to fix it at this point every change just seems poor and then they just arent putting any focus into it
[2:10:07] DlABLO4: that's completely true, but I never did 2s or 3s etc. Solo shuffle is perfect for me
[2:10:12] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[2:10:42] DrVespucci: I love your links @Snowmixy VoHiYo ^^
[2:11:05] Coltynx: theres a double edged sword no matter what you do tbh
[2:11:49] Coltynx: Yea Passion and Communication for sure
[2:12:05] irvinwow: sod they care allot about
[2:12:05] DlABLO4: but also it's good for income right, like streaming normally isn't going to be that financially reliable?? Idk, the other content is like a good backup income and doesn't really change you
[2:12:09] Coltynx: going through the motions
[2:12:11] irvinwow: they constantly updating
[2:12:33] Coltynx: @irvinwow if you think they are constantly updating you are high... There hasnt been a balance change for PVP since Jan 23rd
[2:12:41] Coltynx: last PVP change was them adding a wand onto the vendor LUL
[2:12:47] DlABLO4: blizz are so slow, they just do a couple patches and complaints are usually ignored, we only ever get mythic raid nerfs and what else?? lol
[2:12:48] epicpockettroll: why tf is SoD of all things gettin this much attention
[2:12:54] epicpockettroll: from blizzard
[2:13:12] StreamElements: My current playlist is: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5yfpG2DjHPthKZwAbD8tYE
[2:13:15] DlABLO4: SOD is good, it's just a passion project from a unique team
[2:13:38] Coltynx: @epicpockettroll IMO sod is easier for them to balance, less abilities, less modifiers, less classes limited encounters etc etc. and it is an experimental version of the game so they kind of have free reign.. dont have to worry ab MDI/AWC etc
[2:13:39] epicpockettroll: balancing? KEKW since when they balancing retail regularly
[2:13:45] DlABLO4: exactly it's not like devs are taken off of retail and put into SOD, they are their own team like a separate group under the WOW umbrella
[2:13:45] xgodarms: Retail is just more work overall than sod
[2:13:53] xgodarms: hence updating sod is easier
[2:15:03] DlABLO4: yeah you'd be forced to follow trends even if it's boring to you
[2:15:06] DlABLO4: now you can be yourself
[2:15:12] DlABLO4: best for everyone because we know you enjoy it too!
[2:15:12] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[2:15:31] DlABLO4: you put it perfectly
[2:15:32] irvinwow: what is this other source?
[2:15:53] Coltynx: allows for more time off when needed probably great for the mental tbh
[2:16:01] Coltynx: freedom matters
[2:16:24] Veellax: im just here for the playlists LUL
[2:17:18] Coltynx: PTV such a classic
[2:17:19] Ozars: @Veellax Same, don't even play WoW atm. I need a top band list.
[2:17:21] SmokeBud24Seven: So happy u still streaming cause ur personality makes the spicy even better
[2:17:27] DlABLO4: I'm glad your content here stayed the same
[2:17:47] DlABLO4: like I think some others just make twitch into a plug for their other content
[2:17:48] SmokeBud24Seven: LUL
