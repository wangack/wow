[2:44:25] abbosss: at least you could fucking get loot in BFA
[2:44:26] Supers18: Towelliee ive never seen u this down on a retail expansion since wod
[2:44:29] CritcobainTV: I didn't enjoy the end of BFA tbh, but season 1 i had a lot of fun pvping and shit
[2:44:32] abbosss: fuck shadowlands
[2:44:37] Jay_rb: SLG tho
[2:44:43] Noobish101: played shadowlands for 1 week, did castle once and that was it
[2:44:44] stijn0416: is shadowlands that bad?

[2:44:50] LAXNESS: bfa and sl are both terrible compared to legion
[2:44:51] DrakeDuude: i play a warlock so this raid tier i hate
[2:45:07] PieceOfPanic: Druids were big in TBC as well, feral was kinda insane in TBC PvP
[2:45:10] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee I'll be honest, the only thing that makes Nathria not in my top 3 is the fact that my dumbass is directionally challenged and im always gettin lost KEKW

[2:46:14] CritcobainTV: My issue right now is like, most of my bis gear comes from pvp, MAYBE i clear mythic CN fully and get 1-2 ilvls? but im already 225
[2:46:18] CritcobainTV: so what's the damn point
[2:46:31] abbosss: @Dubbzy001 the entire point of doing content is for gear you dumbass

[2:48:24] CritcobainTV: Luffa got nerfed HARD in TBC because for certain fights it could remove bosses bleeds, do you remember that shit? @Towelliee KEKW
[2:48:24] JinzDan: Are comparing with end of bfa or start of bfa? Because imo start of SL is miles ahead of start of bfa.

[2:49:24] Supers18: china # 1
[2:49:25] abbosss: he's multiboxing not botting
[2:49:28] Sleepylol93: At this point either lower the montly sub or rise it so ppl wont bot anymore
[2:49:29] abbosss: you're going to fuck him from the automated system
[2:49:31] Ecnz: @critcobain Moroes, in Kara - could just make the boss have no bleed effect before they fixed it LUL
[2:49:36] bobbyBRASH: What is Illidan Alert?
[2:49:37] Venkxx: well they all jumped at the same time, thats probably because of a third party tool
[2:49:38] GonoFPS: the funny part is they dont even try to hide youre right lmao
[2:49:43] PieceOfPanic: @Wulfgrym Like he just said, if he's using software. It's not okay. It has to be mechanical multibboxing. Which is highly unlikely.

[3:29:06] Doedje: I dont mind buying a boost
[3:29:17] RawrCute: I don't care enough anymore to care about the boost being potentially bad. I just wanna play and ignore all drama :P
[3:29:30] dreamjag: yeh always hated leveling
[3:29:33] Layercake: And quit after 2 weeks because they can't handle BC grind LUL . And Blizzard knows that...they give 0 shits about new players etc
[3:29:36] cuttwarior2: towellie they way u explai stuff played a big part in me n my buddy getting back into
[3:29:39] ragepowerr: where is this alpha?
[3:29:41] Merlin840: i have to warriors in classic.. both level 36.
[3:29:55] Tsunami_Samurai22: @Merlin840 why?
[3:29:57] flebbooo: i honestly couldn't care less about the boost at this point. These extreme classic andies need to understand blizz making these decicison for the health of the game
[3:29:59] xdtai: @Towelliee when are you going to remove this part from your channel description? " Don't miss World of Warcraft Shadowlands expansion Launch Party Nov 23rd 3PST" I think its past that time already :P
[3:30:07] KekkePeke: i can't wait for all the Fairline drama be back in tbc KEKW
[3:30:13] metavahn231: more bad players is still better than no players
[3:30:18] legobind: bc grind was fun
[3:30:24] metavahn231: rep grind*
[3:30:26] Merlin840: @Merlin840 one is from classic launch, the other is from leveling with friends.
[3:30:28] flanders61: BC grind feels rewarding thou
[3:30:28] TweakT: players that didnt level in classic aint gonna level in bc either KEKW
[3:30:38] I3Iackarrow: do you think i can dungeon grind until 70 without a premade group of friends ?  @Towelliee
[3:30:40] szble: dude people are gonna fly to 70
[3:30:41] GoeglerenDK: BC grind is badges of justice
[3:30:42] Andrroo: 80
[3:30:46] ragepowerr: where he is playing now?
[3:30:47] metavahn231: "it was easy on my 4x boosted pserver"
[3:30:50] shmurcules: If someone else bots they bot .. it doesn’t affect you
[3:30:54] Supers18: cant wait for these new players to get a boost and do attunements KEKW

[3:31:40] Doedje: Done feralas yet?
[3:31:45] metavahn231: boting effects the economy which effects everyone, it would be pretty sad if the wow token was the only thing blizzard could come up with
[3:31:51] maianja: Love this music.

[3:32:45] Andrroo: false
[3:32:47] jayplayscorner: faction change and race change was data mined for tbc
[3:32:48] flanders61: how likely you think Dual spec is @Towelliee
[3:32:48] Layercake: Blizzard have 0 interested in stopping bots, they are making problem and them offer a solution...wow tokens.
[3:32:49] Chris_127: Chris_127 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Illidan is back Boyz
[3:32:55] TweakT: if they introduce the wow token in classic at least I can finally play only 1 version of the game for game-time
[3:33:00] legobind: if i can play bc and get tokens i am happy i hate having to go to SL to get my token
[3:33:06] shmurcules: So botting hurts the economy but tokens don’t lmao
[3:33:14] Overlopare: Streamers dont care about bots! they got shit for free anyway
[3:33:14] ragepowerr: is that funserver
[3:33:24] Doedje: More money to Bobby LUL
[3:33:27] jayplayscorner: faction change and race change was data mined for tbc
[3:33:27] BadXo: Bobby needs more bonuses - grab that cash
[3:33:28] Doedje: 200 mil btw yesterday
[3:33:28] cuttwarior2: what is a wow token
[3:33:36] TweakT: activision stonks go up up up
[3:33:39] dedg3: no cam anymore? :(
[3:33:40] thecynicalshuffler: azuresong server
[3:33:46] Red_Dead_Redeem: !cam
[3:33:46] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while
[3:33:49] flanders61: id rather pay blizz and have less bots lol
[3:34:07] ragepowerr: oh thats calssic at all @thecynicalshuffler
[3:34:20] Lemonmunch3r: I feel that the level boost is more harmful than the token. People pay to skip content that is essential to the classic experience. Botters will use this a lot and other people will run out of content faster.
[3:34:20] thisisgoodcontent: private servers had better bot detection software
[3:34:25] flanders61: ive played all of classic and the Black lotus bots were a nightmare
[3:34:25] jayplayscorner: ill be honest even with the wow token on retail buying gold on websites is still way cheaper
[3:34:28] TweakT: but Russian private servers did Kappa
[3:34:53] invictusseu: @cuttwarior2  a token is 30 days game time, u can se1l in ah for gold, token costs real money
[3:34:55] CritcobainTV: That's what it comes down to bro, they dont' wanna spend the money to have more people working on it
[3:34:55] Layercake: Why invest in that if they pump more money with the tokens...it's a no brainier
[3:34:57] bloodwieser: private did it
[3:35:08] cuttwarior2: ty
[3:35:13] Erielle04: What is the chance of the beta releasing today?
[3:35:17] jayplayscorner: thats true
[3:35:38] Sinamun1: but is it perma ban or just few days for buying gold ?
[3:35:46] jayplayscorner: do you think faction change and race change will come in tbc it looked like it got data mined?
[3:35:56] metavahn231: the pserver admins are the botters Kappa
[3:35:57] TweakT: they had automatic bot detection
[3:35:58] Red_Dead_Redeem: @Sinamun1 I think it's perma banned
[3:36:13] MrEvilRex: botting happens in live as well, surely the anti-bot software would be against botting in both live and classic?

[3:37:02] Red_Dead_Redeem: just had some cranitas tacos, they were so damn good :)

[3:41:17] metavahn231: wrath was just too easy
[3:41:17] RawrCute: @aureliusxv, Same reason why people play mario still. And any old game. Same reason you level a new toon in retail
[3:41:18] Red_Dead_Redeem: I played in WOTLK
[3:41:18] blozham: People aren't allowed to like two very similar versions of the game?
[3:41:22] Lazugo: People think that when bc classic launch they're gonna enter a time machine or some shit and relive the same experience that they had 15yrs ago. Guess waht dumbass you are not
[3:41:28] Red_Dead_Redeem: I just missed TBC
[3:41:28] TheCliffyShow: Inb4 they are claiming Cataclysm was the best period of WoW. Then WoD!

[3:41:41] Muffyv: i started watching you when i was in middle school when you played TBC.
[3:41:53] Red_Dead_Redeem: WOD worst expansion ever other than Cata

[3:43:35] Layercake: I don't put all the ''classic andys'' in the same pot, there are people that understand that gaming is not same and some things need to change
[3:43:38] Wulfgrym: the classic andy's got what they wanted, time for htem to check out and stay with classic while the rest of move on to tbc

[3:53:20] KodyTheTyger: i still consider bfa worse than wod, by far
[3:53:22] mavericks312: towel you see the pats are signing everyone
[3:53:22] MuttonChopins: WoD just had good raids
[3:53:23] ventu105: Legion was the best expantion for me
[3:53:27] Joryckfree: @phoenixautv its actually not there are some people here and there , so u re using argument that there can be boost cuz why not kill the world more ? :D
[3:53:30] Venkxx: during wod, I didnt have that much time, and I only did raids, so for me it was one of the best expansions, and warlocks were still fun before legion fucked them

[3:53:54] raymond3195: worst xpans vanilla
[3:53:57] nixter93: dude, fuck WoD. highmaul was the shittiest raid of all time

[3:54:21] Folkja: I actually liked the garrisons, but hated the rest of the expansion
[3:54:22] raymond3195: wod was good but not enough content
[3:54:24] metavahn231: wod was pretty good for pvp
[3:54:25] nadler6077: my favorite xpac was legion by far

[3:54:54] Kromede: i miss Yrel
[3:55:00] nixter93: dude, i really like shadowlands levelling story tbh
[3:55:05] nixter93: i think id put it above WoD for me
[3:55:16] Zettabyte: What damage text addon are you using for retail @Towelliee?
[3:55:21] Julian_______: i really wanna play wow again, but got no one to play with and im noob
[3:55:31] TheCliffyShow: Anyone else start hearing the Jurassic Park theme whenever they go into Un'goro Crater?

[3:56:28] ILikeKillTheZombies: i think that jailor is so far the weakest character in shadowlands
[3:56:33] ahla03: @Towelliee are you excited for FFXIV for ps5 or are you only going to play it on pc?
[3:56:36] Sharrak0r: shared spawns
[3:56:39] Red_Dead_Redeem: @allenh93 idk tho, they have always timed gated stuff, I just feel like there is not a lot to do once you are geared
[3:56:55] dtrybs: no changes
[3:57:29] nadler6077: does anybody know which playlist towel uses for his ingame music?
[3:57:38] Red_Dead_Redeem: #maybesomechangesaregood
[3:58:07] KodyTheTyger: i consider wod better than bfa because the class design was really good and I wanted to play it a ton, there just wasn't a lot to do. Bfa didn't feel fun for me to play because I had almost no control of my damage with all the procs and traits/corruptions giving varying results.
[3:58:35] PhoenixAuTv: @Joryckfree Sigh... Your another classic andy. Not what i was suggestin re read what i said. Also pure and simple classic leveling is boring for so many, people wanna play with their mates so the boost is their to play with their friends and have another character because if theirs wasn't a boost we wouldn't go level another toon any who? End of story, not replying to you now.
[3:59:10] ILikeKillTheZombies: did the transmog system came with WoD or legion?
[3:59:13] metavahn231: wasent it farmville devs or something
[3:59:19] Red_Dead_Redeem: what about cata?
[3:59:19] Kromede: chat pls
[3:59:29] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Mornin' mang.
[3:59:56] KodyTheTyger: my only excuse for that is i completed a lot of the expansion. Raided, got exalted reps, etc in wod. But if bfa i got super burned out with all the chores, would like to see some kind of in-between but i don't have those answers.
[4:00:00] Red_Dead_Redeem: what you drinking atm @Towelliee
[4:00:20] luckfore: the long draughts will be very bad for SL
[4:00:37] Thunderbrew: Classic Priest is the way to go with no down time.

[4:19:36] CADZtv: i think wow figured a great pacing with dialogue and action lol
[4:19:46] Bogzeh: and its considered the best one LUL
[4:19:49] KodyTheTyger: one of the best expansions they've done, story was awesome
[4:19:55] spyrit14: the original Asian grinder
[4:20:10] KekkePeke: just skipping the cutscenes and getting max level in 12h
[4:20:15] Reap14: It is the best expansion easily and there is no better story in any mmo.
[4:20:22] Ribastur0075: as ppl say here, story got better later on
[4:20:32] Red_Dead_Redeem: that sounds wrong, asian grinder...  LUL
[4:20:43] CADZtv: story gets better later it should ahve me right away
[4:20:46] spyrit14: Not true when it comes to story The Secret world did it best.

[4:22:39] metavahn231: SB did put way too much story into the start
[4:22:46] Armdel: My problem with ff14 has been that i love the story, but i get bored once i get to the end game
[4:22:47] spyrit14: The combat alone in 11 was better, a team effort to do high damage the Renki chart is immeanse.

[4:40:36] rocthenite: did you see madseasons video?
[4:40:48] KodyTheTyger: Some of them just heavily regretted playing on a pvp server LUL
[4:41:19] Gorestack: no fresh is a far bigger problem than level boost
[4:41:27] PixelNites: idk how people say boosts ruin the ecnonomy, if anything people will stop buying so much gold with real $$$
[4:41:31] xobalt: betaaaa
[4:41:42] PixelNites: these people are gonna be level 58 with 0 skills in their professions, theyre gonna wanna buy your shit lol
[4:41:46] Lazugo: Fearlina will be a shitshow on bc launc
[4:41:56] AirmVn: @PixelNites what do you think a fresh lvl 58 booster will do for cash ?
[4:41:59] xobalt: i think we wont see beta this week. Sadge...
[4:42:07] maccaruso: Pay daddy blizz for the boost or pay gold to get boosted.  Same difference
[4:42:21] belfastcl: @AirMAnLTK some will buy gold
[4:42:44] metavahn231: now 70 boost is where i put my foot down just no
[4:42:55] iseenoobpeoplee: LUL
[4:43:18] MrGattz: i think we should get 80 boosts
[4:43:19] spyrit14: So what would be the best race alliance side for shadow priest?
[4:43:30] spyrit14: on TBC
[4:43:34] AirmVn: @Towelliee I think the problem is the precedence that this boost sets ..
[4:43:39] Joryckfree: Why do you think the boost is okay ?
[4:43:41] metavahn231: thats just the forums ranting
[4:43:45] victorballing: how about a level 40 boost?
[4:43:57] AirmVn: but yeah I would love for them to sell 58 boosts but focus more on fixing boting
[4:44:09] CritcobainTV: LUL
[4:44:10] Sluggs_: wotlk classic will have a lvl 68 boost
[4:44:11] AirmVn: but this is not retail
[4:44:23] AirmVn: don;t get me I like boosts
[4:44:29] AirmVn: I'm just saying
[4:44:30] snuffles_80: money
[4:44:35] MrGattz: there is no precedence. causals dont want to level for 500 hours. boosts help the game in general in every aspect because more players get to play the game. end of story.
[4:44:42] FMJayce: When will 58 boosts be available? for TBC launch or pre patch? @Towelliee
[4:44:43] Zeke_nl: grats on danny bro
[4:44:46] AirmVn: but if people want retail go play retail
[4:44:54] tripl3heart: TRU
[4:45:11] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah that's true
[4:45:13] spyrit14: What's gonna happen in Wrath classic the same thing what happened  in retail wrath a whole lotta fresh DKs, all three specs tanking
[4:45:15] AirmVn: but they already have that
[4:45:16] metavahn231: atleast its just 58
[4:45:19] cokegaeming: i think people under estimate how many new players will start playing because of the boost
[4:45:19] tripl3heart: sstvEmcel but its not classic experience sstvEmcel
[4:45:20] Attackroot: use retail to farm gold  to buy ur boost in tbc classic.
[4:45:21] AirmVn: it's retail why is it hard to understand
[4:45:22] the_doji: the whole anti boost thing makes zero sense. Who cares who boosted and who didn't. "It's not fair" is like the aholes who are like let's not feed the poor because i paid for my food
[4:45:28] HolySpiritActiv8: leveling is part of the game you shouldn't get to skip through it all
[4:45:28] maccaruso: Classic was a game all unto itself.
[4:45:32] belfastcl: @AirMAnLTK arguing about that here is pointless, retail crowd is into all that already
[4:45:44] Venkxx: they just want to feel superior
[4:45:45] tripl3heart: wtb classic gold
[4:45:52] AirmVn: how was it a shit show ?
[4:45:55] TheUnknowing: its 2021, things arent going to be like they were back in the day its not 2004 any more its not 2007, things change
[4:46:02] KimJongCam: why is min/max the meta rn?
[4:46:03] ukkihc: Still playing classic, raiding naxx and getting rdy for tbc, I like it
[4:46:05] spyrit14: classic is to fill the empty time between major content patches
[4:46:10] baraktus: wtb classic token :P
[4:46:13] AirmVn: no, how was it a shit show
[4:46:16] HolySpiritActiv8: they just want their game to be how it was it's really a simple request
[4:46:17] AirmVn: sorry I don't get it
[4:46:18] metavahn231: metaslaves ruin everything
[4:46:24] Freakzene: There is always the suuuper ''secret'' private servers for people who want to gate keep LUL
[4:46:24] belfastcl: classic was pretty fun for a lot of people
[4:46:31] CasualSCN: people made toxic macros spamming "go back to retail" 24/7 how was it not a shit show LUL
[4:46:35] metavahn231: the patch was wrong
[4:46:43] blozham: Classic wasn't perfect but it was massively successful and to lots of people hugely enjoyable
[4:46:51] vradanis: MasterParallax subscribed with Prime. 
[4:46:57] Vodkanic: LUL
[4:46:57] AirmVn: but that's 80% of the population
[4:46:58] victorballing: The guardian of our solarsystem is Jupiter
[4:47:04] ravenoushydra: the drama is the best part of classic tho LUL
[4:47:06] AirmVn: why are we catering again on the 1%
[4:47:10] metavahn231: the population went capute
[4:47:12] finlayg98: I'm going to get a boost in tbc. I wanna play with my boys but also don't have the time to level through classic now. Barely have enough time for retail wow let alone classic
[4:47:12] Ldysansa: It’s a game and people want to enjoy it. Classic was bad
[4:47:18] spyrit14: I am sure people who had never experienced classic had fun, it served it's purpose.
[4:47:21] AirmVn: but that is 1%
[4:47:26] AirmVn: of the population
[4:47:27] baraktus: allots of bots on fearlina its insane
[4:47:28] KodyTheTyger: people getting death threats for ninja'ing an epic boe LUL
[4:47:39] Layercake: You can say the same thing about retail
[4:47:40] KekkePeke: that is why you didn't go to the "streamer server"
[4:47:41] BlameCDN: the thing I dont get with the argument, against boosts is that they thing it will destroy the economy and think more supply will inflat prices when thats just now how it works
[4:47:48] BlameCDN: think*
[4:47:50] AirmVn: if you look for negative shit it's only what you find
[4:47:57] captainkippysmith: I shouldn’t need to level through classic content to play a burning crusade reboot
[4:48:05] metavahn231: classic needs retail people to play, there isnt enough of us elft
[4:48:09] metavahn231: left*
[4:48:11] captainkippysmith: I’ve already leveled through all of that content when it was current
[4:48:26] spyrit14: Agreed 100%
[4:48:30] KekkePeke: umm.... no
[4:48:41] AirmVn: pfff
[4:48:49] KekkePeke: unlike retail. in TBC classic is part of the tbc
[4:48:50] spyrit14: I level one chracter in retail and boost the rest.
[4:48:56] AirmVn: sorry you see it like that
[4:48:59] AirmVn: again I like the boost
[4:49:07] Squidnapped: in retail, i only level in dungeons with darkmoon fair lol
[4:49:07] AirmVn: but I see madseansons point of view
[4:49:08] seaperz: I think people just want harcore games how the used to be. Everything should matter etc. You forgot to buy food before going out killing some boars..tough. Your heartstone is on cooldown, you wait 1 hour...you die you have to run for 5 minutes. I think people want that. Hardcore games
[4:49:14] maccaruso: Pagle is still mad crowded too
[4:49:18] KaisenSiru: YEP
[4:49:20] Sluggs_: its going to be the same for tbc classic though
[4:49:22] Red_Dead_Redeem: not everyone has the time and hrs to spend raiding and getting geared to be able to play and have fun in TBC
[4:49:23] KekkePeke: that is player problem
[4:49:23] AirmVn: but it only infested it on pvp servers
[4:49:27] KekkePeke: not a game problem
[4:49:35] tripl3heart: TRUE
[4:49:36] jeneraljelly: @Sluggs_ it will indeed
[4:49:45] Medervik: Its not private server things. Its how ppl play games nowadays
[4:49:48] ukkihc: no changes
[4:49:55] belfastcl: @AirMAnLTK he had good points, but blizz saw an opportunity grab some cash tied to a chance to get people in easily, what can one do
[4:50:04] TwoFacedFlan: Same logic as any other game. I can buy halo 2 and not play halo 1. Some people want to play tbc classic and not vanilla classic.
[4:50:04] Layercake: Boost or no boost , the shitsow has already started. Blizzard knows that
[4:50:20] ARROOCE: Classic is dead, same will happen with TBC, everyone gonna switch ro retail after month anyway LULW
[4:50:21] CasualSCN: Private server players KEKW
[4:50:24] rocthenite: madseason is a content creator who think mostolgia is better and just shit on retail for almost everything
[4:50:26] sonnyk1x: why do we need everyone to come to tbc? its one of the reasons retail became garbage. availability etc... it's not necessary
[4:50:29] LazyDynamics: people against the boost are typical gatekeep players
[4:50:36] ukkihc: If someone is saying classic is dead, you are bs
[4:50:36] maccaruso: The meta-slaving was bad.  No changes was bad.  TBC and #somechanges will be a massive upgrade
[4:50:41] wigglenobber: i was a noob in vanilla and tbc. i didnt hit max until wrath and raided hardcore..which is why wrath is my fav. im excited to see tbc which people say is the best wow ever.
[4:50:44] NILLme: they wnted to stay true to nochanges
[4:50:44] hypno7iq: most people who play classic, don't play retail
[4:50:45] jeneraljelly: @ukkihc for real lmao
[4:50:47] kacchan_bo: @sonnyk1x  what a shit mindset lmao
[4:50:48] spyrit14: Final Fantasy 11 was brutal Chains of Promithia was the hardest xpac I have ever played in a mmo, but the penalty for failure in FFXI was harsh, no changing servers or character names, your reputation as a player was always on the line
[4:50:51] hypno7iq: retail is complete trash
[4:50:57] sonnyk1x: @kacchan_bo good response Clap
[4:51:05] tripl3heart: they should
[4:51:06] Shrenko: @sonnyk1x what is that question? TBC was the greatest wow has even been. Its way better than vanilla and everyone will transfer to TBC
[4:51:10] captainkippysmith: Same people complaining about leveling are the same people who say classic raids are more challenging than retail
[4:51:13] spyrit14: If you were a bad player in FFXI you did not progress
[4:51:14] Sinamun1: and thats what they should do for sure
[4:51:16] captainkippysmith: Which survey says that isn’t true
[4:51:18] GodTheMechanic: The main issue with no changes is that the biggest change from Vanlla is the players
[4:51:21] jeneraljelly: They are just doing whats gonna make them the most money
[4:51:23] Medervik: i think they do it because ppl want it. no?
[4:51:24] blozham: well that was blizzard being lazy really, i mean even the "no changes" crowd wanted progressive itemisation and prenerf bosses
[4:51:28] Mike__Ro: can't wait to see the message ''You recieved a battle Halaa token''
[4:51:40] vradanis: i startes classic bc retail is so boring
[4:51:51] rocthenite: @hypno7iq ok, want a cookiee
[4:51:52] joa_xy: Make changes to tbc classic ? will it not stay like it was when tbc released ?
[4:52:05] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i dont remember it saying boosts, it just said would u want a new realm with a 58 template to start instead of fresh servers
[4:52:08] sonnyk1x: @joa_xy no, there'll be some changes
[4:52:14] jeneraljelly: I loved classic and I have no issues with some changes for TBC /shrug
[4:52:26] cokegaeming: i thought no changes was the play for the first time around 100% but now its time for changes and even when fresh vanilla comes
[4:52:28] KingSlayerYotam: music Kreygasm
[4:52:31] joa_xy: @sonnyk1x what changes ? is there some place i can read about them ?

[4:52:47] Freakzene: People dont understand that bliz aint gonna keep servers up for you 10 private server guys, you need the casuals to play
[4:53:05] sonnyk1x: @joa_xy look up madseason and his take on it
[4:53:13] tripl3heart: BOUGHT gold u mean?
[4:53:15] EvaniTheWarlock: there are is no boost in current classic, it's still full of bots
[4:53:17] BlameCDN: i'm sitting on 25k personally
[4:53:19] CritcobainTV: I'm at 4.8k right now, i should get it soon
[4:53:23] Vodkanic: Im going ot be one of those druids
[4:53:38] tripl3heart: 1% of the population
[4:53:39] BlameCDN: all using alch on the AH
[4:53:42] littano3: How much for regular flying + epic flying
[4:53:43] rocthenite: or be a sreamer :P
[4:53:48] hypno7iq: ive made about 80k on classic
[4:53:51] Papfar: them mages boosting got all the gold
[4:53:56] NickLeonhearth: I have 22k on classic, and I manly play retail
[4:53:58] Vlalkor: TSM and being a Goblin= Gold on classic :D
[4:53:59] LazyDynamics: the best thing about "no changes" was that the whole classic was on the balanced 1.12 version. it wasnt "no changes" from the beginning
[4:54:02] spyrit14: pick flowers to make gold
[4:54:02] NILLme: how do you farm gold atm? i have 1k but not really playing yet
[4:54:05] NickLeonhearth: mainly*
[4:54:06] Medervik: do you have a single opinion that not defend blizzard? :)
[4:54:13] king_dezyd: damn i been here for like 10 min and im like who are u yellin at
[4:54:14] maccaruso: The gold economy was VASTLY different in Classic than it was in Vanilla.
[4:54:17] DarkRacer125: imma hop out.  wtf
[4:54:25] Specsifier: I love the "People with a ton of gold is 1% of the population" but I see more epic mounts in classic and long bois in retail than those without. /shrug
[4:54:30] Sinamun1: mara boosters best for gold
[4:54:46] BlameCDN: @Maccaruso well yea people are different now, and its 100% a different game
[4:54:50] rocthenite: @Medervik dude he been craping on SL more then baldy
[4:54:56] leden88: i multiboxed this year 20 toons i have enough gold till shadowlands classic
[4:55:05] Medervik: oke
[4:55:20] spyrit14: I don't have much gold in retail wow, but I have never had a real need for it soloing wow is very inexpensive.
[4:55:28] jeneraljelly: race changes

[4:55:51] seaperz: bring in tmog then aswell I guess?
[4:55:56] Layercake: So many design decisions made sense in 2004, that don't sense now. People now will abuse everything in game. Blizzard knows very well the community and they are going to capitalize on that
[4:55:57] OnyxLair77: So is the Xbox and ps5 like a unicorn???? Why in the hell can I still not find one especially when I have Biden money to spend... lol
[4:56:11] sonnyk1x: whats wrong with just leveling a new race
[4:56:14] Clay2K_: @Towelliee did you get your class quest for ST or did you already do it? I think it gives some decentgear
[4:56:27] ARROOCE: @spyrit14 I wanna see u doing m+ keys and raiding solo LULW no clue classic andy
[4:56:32] spyrit14: The wow cash shop is fine, hell play archeage if you want to see a cash shop that will bleed your wallet
[4:56:33] mavericks312: @sonnyk1x classic leveling was trash
[4:56:37] NickLeonhearth: but if he doesnt level of tauren from 0 and he race changes he wont appreciate it Kappa
[4:56:43] Specsifier: but @Towelliee what about the guy that ninja loots every raid and then buys race and name changes to get around the raid blacklists Kappa
[4:56:44] TheUnknowing: your comparing something that actually affects the game versus something that doesnt @seaperz
[4:56:45] maccaruso: Can't change loot type while in combat.  Should be good now.
[4:56:49] sonnyk1x: @mavericks312 well if ppl dont enjoy the game they shouldnt play it..

[4:57:02] Sincline387: @sonnyk1x FOUND THE CLASSIC ANDY!
[4:57:03] Shrenko: @mavericks312 lvling is like 80% of classic and the most fun part imo. classic isnt really for you if you dont like the lvling
[4:57:17] spyrit14: Why do you think I do dungeons or raids ? I don't take part in group content period, nor do I have any expectations to do so.
[4:57:33] mavericks312: @Shrenko i agree thats why i dont play classic
[4:57:35] Wavekingg: Wavekingg subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Im a newbie here
[4:57:36] KekkePeke: "a lot of money" = 20$ LUL
[4:57:42] spyrit14: that is what soloing in wow is, no group content.
[4:57:42] EvaniTheWarlock: name change was in tbc so that point in moot anyway
[4:57:49] rocthenite: madseason said that wow is the only game that have a box price, a sub, dlc/expansons and mtx, he seem to forgot FFXIV exist is doing better then the F2P mmos like swtor and eso
[4:57:51] NuckyWucky: I think players who boosted should have an icon next to their name so we all know who's cheated :D
[4:57:53] Wulfgrym: imagine SUPPORTING the game you guys love?
[4:57:54] Specsifier: It was sarcasm anyway haha
[4:57:56] CADZtv: classic leveling for the first time is great but after you do it once fuck that
[4:57:57] KekkePeke: but its not a lot of money
[4:58:01] metavahn231: maybe dont have ffa loot then
[4:58:06] NILLme: name changing can be abused
[4:58:09] Sincline387: people don't understand that a server transfer does the same thing......just put a level 1 toon on the server your transferring to with your name
[4:58:18] Sluggs_: 14 makes a lot of money in their store
[4:58:31] death_fisted: 14 has a story skip lol
[4:58:32] OnyxLair77: You missed my comment on consoles... got any tips on finding one??
[4:58:34] the_doji: you can boost any class in 14, mog etc. and people do it.
[4:58:39] CADZtv: final has a b2p and f2p store literally
[4:58:43] Freakzene: @NuckyWucky Way to show off how ''non-toxic'' classic players are KEKW let's publicly bully people who buy a boost
[4:58:45] EvaniTheWarlock: @NiLLx_  who the fuck cares stop thinking the world is going to end
[4:58:46] KekkePeke: ff14 is paid mmo with mobile game ingame store KEKW
[4:58:48] metavahn231: xiv stole boosts from WoW, they got tired of WoW always stealing from them LUL
[4:59:01] Zivs: Then you have JB tweeting that he wishes WoW had MORE mtx
[4:59:11] Sluggs_: LoL was getting big during cata
[4:59:15] spyrit14: players of wow and ffxiv are interchangeable.
[4:59:16] GoodBoy955: i got a stimmy, i can afford $20 KEKW
[4:59:18] sonnyk1x: The bad systems and gameplay + design might be because they tried to make wow available to a bigger playerbase, and ruining the core concept that made it good to begin with
[4:59:32] CADZtv: 100%
[4:59:40] Demorase: nothing touched wow
[4:59:41] AirmVn: eve online
[4:59:46] spyrit14: the mmo genre is saturated.
[4:59:47] iceman2kx: star wars galaxies lol
[4:59:47] Wavekingg: @Towelliee You missed my sub :(
[4:59:48] Brummos: runescape!
[4:59:48] KekkePeke: Runescape
[4:59:50] CADZtv: eve online KEKW
[4:59:51] GoodBoy955: boomerscape KEKW
[4:59:54] FMJayce: It was WoW for PC and Halo / Cod for consoles and that was it
[4:59:57] Molseh: WoW hasnt really lost subs to other mmos though I feel. More just people leaving the genre
[4:59:58] Triist0ne: Guild Wars was pretty cool
[5:00:00] Brummos: LUL
[5:00:03] Bogzeh: aion wow killer during wotlk
[5:00:05] DUSTYF66: FFXI
[5:00:06] Triist0ne: idk how big it was tho
[5:00:08] MrGattz: what was the question?
[5:00:10] MVRD: Aion was Pog
[5:00:10] MrGattz: i missed it
[5:00:11] CADZtv: guild wars never came close to wow
[5:00:16] schizowillie: 2010
[5:00:18] Paperz9: Blizz: Gameplay first also blizz: lets remove 60% of gameplay with a boost
[5:00:18] Muffyv: whats wrong with runescape
[5:00:20] sonnyk1x: 2009-2010
[5:00:21] Sovanor: I originally quit late WOTLK for League Beta/S1
[5:00:23] KekkePeke: you can laugh as much as you want but RS fucking prints money
[5:00:23] Wulfgrym: 2009
[5:00:25] Julian_______: runescape peak was like 200-300k
[5:00:27] thisisgoodcontent: i thought madseasons vid was very well thought out and logical tbh
[5:00:32] hoodhussler: Did I hear “wild hammer”?
[5:00:34] spyrit14: Final fantasy 11 was bigger than wow when wow first launched.
[5:00:53] CritcobainTV: @MrGattz hows your gun? lol
[5:00:59] MrGattz: @Julian_______ way more than that but in that time period there was also a free to play aspect that was decent
[5:01:01] spyrit14: FFXI had a huge japanese following.
[5:01:07] Sincline387: yea we all left because we could change our race...totally
[5:01:10] NivedTheBaldKing: warhammer online was fun to and everquest 2 lol
[5:01:17] CADZtv: @spyrit14 thats the dumbest comparison ever
[5:01:17] seaperz: I mean people are driven by emotion
[5:01:19] metavahn231: the f2p craze brought WoW down alot
[5:01:20] LSBreed: reeeee store mounts lul
[5:01:21] FMJayce: I'm a perfect example of someone who stopped playing wow since vanilla after cata because of League of Legends @Towelliee
[5:01:34] spyrit14: FFXI launched before wow, it was credited for bringing the auction house to the mmo genre
[5:01:44] MrGattz: @critcobain its amazing lol im hitting like normal hits for 130 damage at level 33
[5:01:54] Demorase: i remember quitting during cataclysm cause the game just wasnt fun compared to wotlk
[5:01:54] bacsick: !camera
[5:01:57] NivedTheBaldKing: guild wars 1 pvp was so fun u
[5:01:59] MrGattz: !cam
[5:01:59] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while
[5:01:59] CritcobainTV: EZ
[5:02:04] Xwolf1989: i quit because most of my server switched to horde and there was no one on alliance so....

[5:03:39] spyrit14: bottom line, FFXI ate your life.
[5:04:03] Xwolf1989: at the end of wotlk in my server there was 10 horde players for 1 alliance because of faction change....
[5:04:21] Xwolf1989: wintergrasp wasnt fun lol
[5:04:34] garlicco: yes they added sex change to barber i think
[5:04:35] TheUnknowing: faction, race, etc all came in wrath

[5:05:16] TheGaoSora: everybody wanted to be belf lol
[5:05:25] spyrit14: 3 dk tank specs Unholy was an amazing tank before the nerfs
[5:05:45] spyrit14: that's when DnD feared
[5:05:46] rocthenite: question would madseason be ok with fration/race change in wotlk classic?
[5:05:51] Sluggs_: you cant boost a BE or draenei so you still have to level those the old way
[5:05:52] prejak: in cata/wrath.. most of the pvp community was alliance anyway, due to human racial
[5:06:15] prejak: mop*
[5:06:26] KodyTheTyger: @rocthenite he said he'd be ok with any paid service if it shows up whenever it originally came out, such as wrath having race changes or w/e
[5:06:26] Xwolf1989: @rocthenite he probably would because it was a feature back then
[5:06:35] TheGaoSora: THIS IS IT!!
[5:06:40] TheGaoSora: rip
[5:06:55] Clay2K_: @Towelliee  here is a link to your quest. Looks like you have to touch the statues to summon the dude for the vine

[5:17:59] spyrit14: that's mobil and not pc
[5:18:20] spyrit14: I want it to be remastered by SE
[5:18:29] Jasix: Still looked ok for what they were going for but yeah shame it's mobile but it could probably get a PC release also.
[5:18:58] Jasix: But it probably got the axe after NEXON fell on torubled times financially
[5:19:04] spyrit14: I don't understand why they are still making money from it
[5:19:05] shimwood: shimwood subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Has it really been 12 months? Feels like I just started watching last year.

[5:25:51] metavahn231: like 90 boomers in there that are missing the game but at the same time they probably killed it LUL
[5:25:57] Kromede: should we tell Bobby to buy wildstar? i mean he has enough MiniK

[5:26:41] ILikeKillTheZombies: i remember when wildstar was giving away free max lvl boosts trying to save the game
[5:26:51] KodyTheTyger: NCsoft likes to put their IP's on a shelf and leave them for dead.
[5:26:52] wetzl: thats why all the Lineage 2 private servers are ran out of russia.

[6:36:11] Nasilvera: Anima is harder to get than Azerite
[6:36:11] xBanosh: imo they saw how many people wanted to play classic and changed systems in that direction. but there are few people playing both. you like the classic style or retail. most dont like both.
[6:36:12] K0rzak0v: I preferred BFA before essences :p
[6:36:22] PieceOfPanic: But u know, that's the way a lot of games are going these days. The companies have too shortsighted visions.

[6:36:23] ZeusDNA: Is hype sauce an option?
[6:36:25] swordwindgaming: I thought KSC achiev = ilvl 213 was awful. Most player mains+1 alt are ilvl 213 by now.
[6:36:28] CDubTheRIPper: i ended up getting more swedish fish and peach rings before it went out
[6:36:34] ZeusDNA: Hype Sauce is amazing. It's raspberry lemonade
[6:36:42] Theduskflyer: Hear me out...... what if there was Raid+ like m+ but you can 2 and 3 chest it, and you get more loot at the end.... huh! Huh!
[6:36:42] Whippedkreme: I think peach rings was available but it is out of stock iirc @Towelliee
[6:36:50] Sollice: I wonder what the Classified Flavor is
[6:37:15] Shrenko: both US only FailFish
[6:37:26] SonofHorus82: I just flat did NOT like Scorpion Sting.
[6:37:27] Sollice: So maybe avoid then
[6:37:43] Whippedkreme: I got a classified and hype sauce @Towelliee
[6:37:53] lanara233: You win a mission table mission if the amount by which one or more of your heals/dps exceeds the computer's heals/dps is greater than the amount by which one or fewer of the computer's heals/dps exceeds your heals/dps
[6:38:16] swordwindgaming: @killerkain_icecrown vault stops giving straight upgrades after a while and eventually everything is a dupe or a slightly sidegrade
[6:38:16] rocthenite: the issue with their design of SL is that they try to court in the classic fanboys, they didn't understand what made classic good, and the classic fans would just find a reason to shit on retail anyways (like blaming race changes or something)

[6:38:25] DehCantao: I mean, doing +20 is not casual. High keys could give 226/233 loot.
[6:38:31] tchiz2711: Doesn’t help that they made the best way to get gear was to be boosted through pvp bc pve gearing sucked
[6:38:34] PieceOfPanic: Systems are designed around competition for the 1%
[6:38:52] Julia: they would get so many new players with some features like housing and more things to collect or fun stuff
[6:38:55] Sollice: @Towelliee Aww you cant use your code on a bogo. Makes sense. Do you still get credit for the purchase though using your link?
[6:38:56] GermanBacon: sounds like WoD 2.0... kinamaHmm
[6:38:57] swordwindgaming: SL is going to go down as WoD 2.0 if it doesn't get better treatment.
[6:39:06] PieceOfPanic: AGREED
[6:39:06] 2MakeMe: UHHHH
[6:39:16] Beriech: Shadowlands killed retail once and for all for me. I'm only playing classic until they stop... then I'll be done with wow

[6:39:38] rocthenite: funny, people where angry af becuase sylvainas beat up the lich king
[6:39:40] PexaU: Agree to disagree; I think the Anduin storyline is lame and if Sylvanas gets a redemption arc, that's even worse
[6:39:43] Chutsu: did covid kill WoW?

[6:40:14] swordwindgaming: SL main story is lame as f. Some of the covenant stories are good, but thats it.
[6:41:29] PieceOfPanic: I think the main story is good. The idea of sylvanas finally breaking the chains is amazing.
