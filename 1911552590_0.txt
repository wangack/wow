[0:45:04] Molvonos: Then you were just playing classic.
[0:45:08] Meliea_EU: i dont accept this sort of death it was not my fault
[0:45:35] Meliea_EU: no i was playing hc with addon, my char was even still lsited

[2:27:17] ArcaneMaki: @mavericks312 Yes it is a product of its time, but Sea of Stars managed to make it more interesting with a hit system just like Super Mario RPG where you can get extra attack or def if you press action at the right time.
[2:27:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: The next gen consoles are going to be a lot stronger
[2:27:46] justagamingfiend: at least Elders 6 will come out before Ashes

[2:42:35] Jynt334: What addon is it that is telling you that information?
[2:42:39] Scarhearth: As much as people hate the official HC for omg you can trade and group its not real hardcore. Hardcore does not mean ironman(solo self found)
[2:42:40] Rottencoarse: oh yeah espeically when they hyperspawn
[2:42:46] iamspacemanspiff: respawns kill people in that cave
[2:43:01] nusher1: @Towelliee Gotta be careful with the hyperspawn in this cave

[2:45:35] khrovaa: D:
[2:45:41] IgneousLion: @Scarhearth i dont mean the basic HC i mean the Nightmare One
[2:46:10] khrovaa: It’s like they had a system that worked in SL or something
[2:46:11] The_Marijuana_NA: bears are so broken im doing 18s at 434 ilvl
[2:46:24] Timothious: would you all go engineering with a hunter or leather?
[2:46:28] Scarhearth: Nightmare is just damn near impossible lol

[2:46:54] khrovaa: @the_marijuana_na Tbf I was doing that on pally and dh, if a tank knows what they doing ilvl doesn’t break them as much
[2:46:58] FubarSnafuJJ: Engineer for cheap ammo
[2:46:58] abracka_: engi is invaluable for HC
[2:47:24] The_Marijuana_NA: khrovaa but bears are a different breed man
[2:47:31] Frenaris: kel thuzad
[2:47:31] IgneousLion: @Scarhearth Yea that only dungeon one is straight insane
[2:47:46] VVingnutt: man I'm on my third toon haven't gotten past 10 yet...

[2:48:28] Frenaris: oh is that a tthing?
[2:48:35] Frenaris: faking deaths?
[2:48:36] Noshpan: What HC server did Towelliee pick?

[2:50:41] Noshpan: @Scarhearth My man. I would've done the same thing. Mostly because I'd either be laughing or shaking my head.

[2:56:34] N3llee: How did the Desiny playthrough go. I ended afk all weekend
[2:56:45] Herzenliegen: mmmm hmmmm
[2:56:47] Rottencoarse: yeah you should go to DM at lvl 20 at max
[2:56:49] bad_fish_too: Healer in hardcore dungeons gotta be monkaS
[2:56:51] Timothious: I played a wizard in EQ very squishy
[2:57:00] im_n0t_jezus: thats next level
[2:57:01] Scarhearth: @Timothious nowadays necros soloing is using a healer merc, warrior pet and dotting the everliving hell out of a mob rather than fear kiting or drain tanking
[2:57:05] warrenny: That’s brilliant
[2:57:07] falldrgn: That was a dick move.. is that bannable?
[2:57:18] VrtniPatuljak: sociopaths
[2:57:35] Timothious: didn't have merchs when I played
[2:57:41] Rottencoarse: yeah he did some ToS stuff then got banned
[2:57:43] LeXieSterling: Why just touched and not in a good way
[2:57:43] AstridLory: Chat what server is towelliiee olaying on?
[2:57:47] zysmos: tbf that guild was not legit
[2:57:48] NobodybetterPat: Dude needed to be the main chat
[2:57:48] VrtniPatuljak: mmos attract the weirdoes that lack social interaction
[2:57:49] AstridLory: Playing*
[2:57:54] Rottencoarse: he didnt get banned due to the wiping of the raid
[2:57:56] NobodybetterPat: Character*
[2:57:58] Herzenliegen: People get kicked from the guild I'm if they praise him LUL
[2:58:02] Scarhearth: @Timothious wizards the class where outside of PoP they just suck for years
[2:58:05] Timothious: that was close to 20 years ago i think
[2:58:18] falldrgn: Im praying that wipe/death was appealable

[2:59:02] abracka_: WE GO AGANE
[2:59:03] Timothious: I quit when they decided even a non magic class could summon you to them
[2:59:11] Herzenliegen: lmao
[2:59:12] warrenny: The amount of play time wasted tho
[2:59:26] JamboKong: Makes sense. You get passed over for interpersonal relationships over what is fair. Claps for armageddon.
[2:59:35] cipusanx: doing from scratch sounds better than retail mythics spam
[3:00:03] ashwing_: Also classic aint going anywhere LUL
[3:00:07] LeXieSterling: Does that person get band from retail also?
[3:00:09] Herzenliegen: Some of them actually didn't mind because they were on burnout
[3:00:13] N3llee: How did the weekend Destiny play-through go? Get everything finished up, satisfied
[3:00:24] abracka_: HC motto is "here for a good time not a long time"
[3:00:39] Scarhearth: @Timothious yea mob summoning sucks. As someone that boxes a bard for pulling its really dumb when i crit a mob while pulling and i just get summon spammed. Personally current EQ is fun if you play on the progression servers unless you play a wizard cause wizards Kappa
[3:01:20] Timothious: yea bards were amazing when i played
[3:01:21] N3llee: glad to see your enjoying the play through
[3:01:25] The_Marijuana_NA: lvl 38 rip
[3:01:31] Suligane: I'm so glad you like Destiny 2 man, it's my favourite game next to wow
[3:01:35] Noshpan: F

[3:03:25] Scarhearth: @Timothious current server i play on bards are actually close to top in DPS because one of their abilities Boastful bellow can crit for 50-60k when the highest crit atm is 40k which is from warriors lol
[3:03:34] Herzenliegen: yeah
[3:03:39] abracka_: yes they are
[3:03:51] Scarhearth: Show me on the doll where the classic andys hurt you Kappa
[3:03:54] Cheezwhizz: right ... zone back in ang get wrecked

[3:28:59] zlinkly: Wonder if there's a disadvantage using the slipstream dongle for more than 1 device
[3:29:18] The_Marijuana_NA: any decent 3 button mice? ive used the razr abyssus for like 12 years

[3:33:20] Intrus18: Nah I understand it’s a sponsor and I’m all down for quality trust me but the one I got now is solid and 2 years in. There’s obviously lots of garbage out there.
[3:33:22] byrdeen45: No better mouse than the logitech MX 618
[3:33:27] Noshpan: Yeah, for $10 cheaper I can just buy a Redragon. That mouse has last me about 5 years before I had to replace it.
[3:33:28] ktthemage: @dalthalper17 the point being, he isn't good. Another 3-5 year stretch in Chi-town of subpar seasons and celebrating 8-10 win seasons as "Progress"

[3:41:15] Intrus18: I mean i understand its a sponser im just showing my mouse. But no prob.
[3:41:20] firehawk73: Corsair wireless mice have a docking option to charge or is it cable only @towelliee ?
[3:41:39] johniiv: @Sollice You're right man. I was paying half attention and realize after he was in sponser speech. Apologize
[3:41:40] Kriven: @Sollice yeah i just got the new razer kb thats hotswap and foamed and lubed its great out of the box
[3:41:40] abracka_: oh damn, i like the design of this one way more than the original scimitar

[4:46:24] NovaNax: 1800
[4:46:30] CeruleanStar: i'm only 1680ish atm
[4:46:49] NovaNax: you can get to 1800 turbo if you play alot
[4:46:54] itsjustcyn: 1790 for the contest cap i thought
[4:47:20] NovaNax: wait is contest 1790?
[4:47:28] itsjustcyn: @CeruleanStar if you have lightfall, do the legendary campaign. you get to 1770 instantly, then the last 20 power levels arent hard to grind
[4:47:33] NovaNax: il google it
[4:47:44] itsjustcyn: @marazov thats what ive seen, cuz its like 20 power under the recommended
[4:47:54] Suligane: it is 1790 contest mode for ctota
[4:47:57] NovaNax: If you’re at or above 1790 Power level in Destiny 2, you will be “at the cap for all of the encounters” in the raid. Considering there are four encounters in Crota’s End and each raid encounter bumps up the power level of enemies, the raid should start at 1750 Power level for the first encounter and will be 1790 at the final encounter.
[4:48:06] ticklemytoes69420: is wow worth it to get back into stop playing before DF and tried again recenlty but i just got bored easy?

[4:48:39] CeruleanStar: @Towelliee it was a D1 raid so it's been a while
