[3:49:01] SlithTheSivak: druids get flight form with full flight, giving dracthyr a lesser version of dragonriding just means it wont be used
[3:49:13] llNoTToXiCll: whys that its still a good feature for mounts atleast

[4:35:50] HopeThePriest: 1st fights anoying
[4:35:52] DoughBoi_Trev: nighthold is long as hell also
[4:35:54] Llamatude: man soo many ppl mad on beta they cant make a fresh level 70 and they have to level to 70
[4:36:08] manmower: they should bring back Crucible of Storms fated
[4:36:10] deedeemegadoodooo: deedeemegadoodooo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[4:36:12] Kooznik: Shriek is a great 1st boss
[4:36:16] Lobsterofwar: I thought shriekwing was a fun first boss
[4:36:17] IchabodCrain: Fated ICC?
[4:36:18] KyleEverett: @Llamatude I get not wanting to spoil the story and just test the class mechanics, but they'll just have to wait
[4:36:21] ImjustBatin: Gimmicky shit

[4:36:38] TheItalianStallion321: imagine getting mad while you actually have BETA....and most others dont
[4:36:47] Llamatude: i have 2 classes at 70 noww.
[4:37:02] signeddudu: Has the season started for people saying they quit the game because they have no beta key and played for 15+ years?
[4:37:03] manmower: since we have time travel and portals, couldn't they just stitch together pieces of raids in combination for fated?
[4:37:07] Llamatude: its not hard to get to 70
[4:37:08] Dzalek: you think next week might be raid / mythic plus ?
[4:37:09] Retpally9329: Leveling is great, done loremaster on 2 accounts
[4:37:20] Pacsunnnn: does beta have same structure as alpha in terms of waves of builds? or is beta just tuning/talent stuff at this point?
[4:37:27] KyleEverett: I'll admit if I had beta I wouldn't test the levelling cause I want to wait on the story. :D
[4:37:27] theoriginalzinng: yeah i've reported a bunch of things so far in the 4 weeks or so ive been in alpha/beta
[4:37:28] Kelticlore: spine of deathwing is good to see who pays attention to mechanics and who doesnt

[4:38:54] AkuTVgg: Wish there was a way to make leveling more meaningful in an expansion.  Some people just blast through to make level in 4hrs and then spend the next 2 years at max level.   Maybe a way to make getting to max level take at least a few days for the crazy speed levelers?  I dunno. Maybe i‚Äôm crazy?
[4:38:57] rymerre: haha great..99.9999....repeating of course
[4:39:02] gingerbasterd: Everyone that has beta access says "they need casual people to test" but yet if you arent a streamer or a top end raider, you very rarely get access unless you luck out and get a key from a streamer
[4:39:04] strike879: if Dragon Soul would get fated boosting guilds would make bank for last 2 runs
[4:39:22] TaikunGaming: How do you feel about the paladin loosing the interrupt on the shield for drangonflight?
[4:39:35] bypized: To the spam of dungeons for leveling, I just wish they would allow you to spam random dungeons from 10-50. Currently you can only play Altazar or Freehold, when the game has thousands of previous dungeons

[4:41:14] KyleEverett: Wait? Did Avenger's Shield lose it's silence? The wowhead tooltip still has it. It only lost holy power generation didn't it?
[4:41:16] Llamatude: It is nice to get a insta queue now and not having to wait hours like on alpha..
[4:41:22] 1s2real: I think people are just excited for a new expansion and get the fuck out of SL lol
