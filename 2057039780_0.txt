[2:37:46] haze86_: @CaddyWhite it's just giving very low level access that most things are not allowed access to normally
[2:37:50] Heuster__: ddsads
[2:37:50] BryggmanTV: this game is a blast

[2:38:07] oSiius: how do i apply the code?
[2:38:07] OmegaTooYew: @CaddyWhite it gives very indepth access to your PC but it is not new to gaming. Kernel Anti cheats are the best performing ones right now - keeping cheaters out of games

[2:38:29] Cliplast410: @frankattv a badass game
[2:38:31] CaddyWhite: @haze86_ I get they put the AC in just to protect the microtransactions but why wouldnt they go with easy antic heat, much more well known and doesnt invade my pc

[2:38:44] HE911: @chat this any good since they changed the play style perspective?
[2:38:46] marshallxdx7: How do they have everything? Devs gave them all unlocks?
[2:38:47] xGTExDopey: @Stealthy Looks, feels and plays like Outriders...hell I didnt even need to change that many keys from G Hub lol
[2:38:48] feelsshadowman: wtf is outriders
[2:38:52] shrinegg: whats with the apex legends music
[2:38:57] OmegaTooYew: @CaddyWhite easy anti cheat is extremely easy to be cheated on, thats why

[3:31:16] corusame: @xNomaddic Its an extraction coop mission-based shooter with procedurally generated areas. The players success works towards an overall war effort which changes the content for everyone unlocking new stuff etc
[3:31:16] annihilationx12: battlefront 2 vibes
[3:31:18] moldedbythedark: @middors my point is $1 a hour is a dumb metric I hope no one adopts.
[3:31:19] Drobzzz: yo does ps5 use the same anticheat or is that not how that works?
[3:31:21] ControlWarrior: i heard alot of issues with this game
[3:31:23] BuckSleezy: @FSOC1ETY_ yeah those online games were great on the PS2 oh wait
[3:31:23] VinceVirtua: wow is a great game to play. It's the worst to watch imo though
[3:31:24] FSOC1ETY_: i would not even play this if it was free KEKW
[3:31:25] S1Trep: @Middors like fourty bucks homie. It aint that much lol
[3:31:29] fanaticqz: kickBite
[3:31:41] floofmeister: @FSOC1ETY_ grats, tell anyone that cares LUL
[3:31:41] marshallxdx7: @s1trep I’m high on my couch and my money is only going ^ and I like this game 😂 all situational
[3:31:41] flinglish: music alone is terrible
[3:31:42] wtomcej: the running looks pretty derpy
[3:31:46] Cheesos251: @j_bird77 lol no, maybe battlefront 3 after I saw the scrapped footage
[3:31:47] AndreMacassi: this the type of game you play for like a week and then never again.
[3:31:49] BONGODUDEGUY: it's the vex
[3:31:51] FadedOdyssey: @s1trep 40 bucks for 5/10 game is queit pricey
[3:31:53] Arminskyrim: i think they have not fully released their bugs yet
[3:31:54] T3kKO__: @flinglish cant agree more
[3:31:58] CaveMan_2024: I love the soundtrack
[3:32:00] BONGODUDEGUY: @AndreMacassi fr haha
[3:32:02] VinceVirtua: @Drobzzz i think it's called turning off cross-plaform on ps5
[3:32:03] DragonWarden9: $40 is 3 to 4 hours of work in some states.
[3:32:04] Josh4501: @ControlWarrior launch issues, pretty much standard with multiplayer games nowadays
[3:32:06] FSOC1ETY_: @BuckSleezy you must be young ps2 had internet and multiplayer games, ;-)
[3:32:06] Middors: @moldedbythedark that's a metrix I personally use. If I get that much or more from a game I'm perfectly fine with it. Didn't say you had to adopt it. I just said there's no other thing nowadays you can do for $1 per hour.
[3:32:10] CaveMan_2024: the music is epic
[3:32:11] S1Trep: @FadedOdyssey not even slightly. Its fourty dollars lol. Thats not even a lot
[3:32:14] MadSkeels: This game will fizzle out very quickly. Most game last about two weeks before the popularity plummets
[3:32:19] F33n1xlol: Big black boys
[3:32:21] witness_kfc_: The timer up right is only for your items drops
[3:32:21] hijirisora: @wtomcej i mean it also looks like that in the first game tbh
[3:32:23] ProvokeChaos: can ping with Q @shroud
[3:32:26] ControlWarrior: i guess i wait until they fix those issue to buy it . dont want to not able to play
[3:32:32] pri5tinesky9: Can't wait to play after work 😄
[3:32:32] PixelWizard44: heads up this game does have kernal drive anti cheat
[3:32:33] AndreMacassi: it’s too repetitive to last long with players.
[3:32:34] S1Trep: @FadedOdyssey some people need to manage their finances better LMAO
[3:32:35] F33n1xlol: And I hate mpnkeys too
[3:32:36] push_site: @MadSkeels  who cares?
[3:32:36] whereisria: Who is shroud playing with rn
[3:32:36] CaveMan_2024: haters aren't even playing the game
[3:32:37] BuckSleezy: @FSOC1ETY_ i played ratchet and clank 3 online. youre clueless
[3:32:37] marshallxdx7: @dragonwarden9 1 hour for me 😌
[3:32:38] bigcheez40: @MadSkeels  wow thats amazing to kno
[3:32:39] AbelKenevil: Is there cross platform?
[3:32:41] shayed__: what is this game about?
[3:32:41] FadedOdyssey: @s1trep but the game sucks and theres games for 10$ with more value? So in comparison its a bad purchase at 40$
[3:32:41] WriteHanded: all you saying this will die quickly. the first one is a twin stick shooter and people still play it
[3:32:48] corusame: @MadSkeels  nah if you know anything about arrowhead they support their games a lot bringing out tons of new content and updates
[3:32:49] liqxnx: hey it’s mee
[3:32:51] AndreMacassi: @writehanded how many people?
[3:32:52] JerseyBricklayer: @caveman_2024 usually the case
[3:32:53] anata_no_papa: is it free to play chat
[3:32:56] flinglish: shrouds getting paid to promote I’m out
[3:32:58] FadedOdyssey: @s1trep these sound effects ICANT
[3:33:00] F33n1xlol: Shroud can we be racists together?
[3:33:00] 1bzbz: what’s this game about?
[3:33:04] shiftix______: @FadedOdyssey hating for no reason BabyRage
[3:33:05] ControlWarrior: is this on unreal 5 ?
[3:33:06] MadPoison510: Drake
[3:33:07] CaveMan_2024: haters don't even know HD1 exists
[3:33:07] BafflingRainbow: hows that anitcheat?
[3:33:09] FSOC1ETY_: @BuckSleezy you must be around 15, stop smoking toe nails its bad
[3:33:09] mektu1: @shayed__ spreading democracy
[3:33:10] sinthetix: @corusame I'm really hoping they add mechs, loving it so far
[3:33:12] AceOfHalo2: SET UP TURRETS FIRST
[3:33:12] elpollodiablo55: this chat is so lame
[3:33:12] gawd_smack: yea first one was dope
[3:33:13] ej_khaled: @shayed__ liberating super earth🫡
[3:33:14] Drobzzz: @VinceVirtua in other words i guess im asking if ps5 even need the anti cheat, simply bc pcs work in a different way
[3:33:15] DragonWarden9: @marshallxdx7 i was talking about min wage, not people that get overpaid
[3:33:16] floofmeister: @WriteHanded They're all brain dead bro, don't even entertain those goofsters
[3:33:19] FrankieSzLee: @fadedodyssey go play cod than kid
[3:33:19] Fossabot: frankieszlee https://clips.twitch.tv/SmokyWealthyAlfalfaVoteNay-7AsQ-xQwVJTXgRWh | https://clips.twitch.tv/EphemeralDeliciousPuddingPartyTime-gfjIpQ2JpAHLnUex
[3:33:19] S1Trep: @FadedOdyssey depends on your definition of value. In terms of value fourty dollars is change homie
[3:33:22] marshallxdx7: @f33n1xlol xqcSus
[3:33:23] corusame: @sinthetix I'll send you something I think you'll like
[3:33:25] KwazyMojo: @WriteHanded exactly. Helldivers 1 is just as "repetitive" and it still has a loyal fanbase. The skill ceiling is quite high in that game
[3:33:25] BuckSleezy: @FSOC1ETY_ ok, your brain rot is too deep, gl with life
[3:33:26] FadedOdyssey: @shiftix______ i mean it has 5/10 and a low player count on release. Its not just me homie
[3:33:27] moldedbythedark: @middors you’re just not seeing how that quickly turns games into boring 70 hour games. its not realistic.
[3:33:28] FlintTown420: dude broke his damn fingers pputting that combo in
[3:33:33] sinthetix: @corusame HandsUp
[3:33:33] CaveMan_2024: this game is great
[3:33:37] AndreMacassi: devs must be in chat. trying to hype this game up.
[3:33:40] shiftix______: @FadedOdyssey hating for no reason BabyRage 󠀀
[3:33:40] CaveMan_2024: FOR LIBERTY
[3:33:41] F33n1xlol: #weloveracism
[3:33:42] blaiselej: how is he liking this game chat?

[3:33:52] nossiVR: i dont have friend to play with, do you think its still worth to grab this game?
[3:33:53] push_site: I only play what my favorite strimmers play :)
[3:33:55] BuckSleezy: people hating for no reason lmao
[3:33:58] FSOC1ETY_: @BuckSleezy lay down your crackpipe homes
[3:33:59] H3rboss: "low player count" 62k concurrent on Steam
[3:34:00] steakfriesssss: g
[3:34:00] diimple: Game looks pretty fun, music is mid af. Like some 2008 Avengers trailer shit
[3:34:01] MadSkeels: Doesn't matter. The game will not hold attention of most players.  If you love it then have fun.
[3:34:01] CaveMan_2024: game is awesome
[3:34:02] chessstwitcherr: nope
[3:34:03] obidomkenobii: This game is a lot of fun!
[3:34:04] Middors: @moldedbythedark no it doesn't. It turns it into you buying boring games if you buy boring games. That's not my problem lol
[3:34:04] steakfriesssss: h
[3:34:07] ItzTheNoid: the game is dope
[3:34:09] hate_xyz: @AndreMacassi LETSGO fun game
[3:34:10] iDeathSniper: this game is good looking
[3:34:10] CaveMan_2024: haters cope
[3:34:11] marshallxdx7: @f33n1xlol KEKW only counter is to embrace
[3:34:13] VinceVirtua: @Drobzzz yea, not sure I'm curious too. Why people even want to cheat in a co-op like this beats me though
[3:34:16] dabn_tv: L ad
[3:34:16] buck_maul: @FadedOdyssey the 5/10 is the game getting bombed for its anti cheat not the gameplay brother
[3:34:21] AndreMacassi: @hate_xyz fun for a few days. boring after that.
[3:34:21] Drobzzz: @VinceVirtua right lol
[3:34:22] CaveMan_2024: haters seethe
[3:34:24] deadliftanddior: Mercenaries is that you
[3:34:26] ej_khaled: @nossivr yes quickly after server patch I found a match with two mics we continued to play was fun
[3:34:28] BigFellaSimon: the soundtrack is so star wars-like
[3:34:28] hijirisora: people hating on this are literally attention seeking rn lmao

[3:34:44] AndreMacassi: devs definitely
[3:34:45] Wallytreats: this game is $40 buck and probably a good 40 hrrs of fun and then ill set it down why are we complaining chat? not every game needs to 1000hrs to be considered good
[3:34:47] BuckSleezy: haters mad steamer is having fun
[3:34:48] AndreMacassi: in here.
[3:34:48] Drobzzz: @VinceVirtua cuz if the ps5 idnt at risk from the anticheat im picking it up on there
[3:34:49] Stamps1646: @nossiVR not recommended for solo play, but it has matchmaking. You can play solo, but with the design being with a team, it would be more frustrating than fun.
[3:34:49] push_site: @AndreMacassi who fucking cares? People spend $40 to go see a movie with a date that lasts 2 hours...
[3:34:50] xNomaddic: @corusame like.. kind of like battle front 2? on epic
[3:34:52] BONGODUDEGUY: @caveman_2024 I am mad
[3:34:54] J_Bird77: people are never happy and just negative nellys
[3:34:56] S1Trep: CHAT FOURTY DOLLARS IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY
[3:34:58] WriteHanded: Is there any way to hide chat on twitch? This is too toxic for me
[3:34:59] MrRedWarrior: its like if you enjoy 40k, odst, and starship troopers, this is right up your alley
[3:34:59] FSOC1ETY_: that milli tought ps2 did not had online KEKW first console with multiplayer games KEKW
[3:34:59] S4nchoP4nza: HAVE U SEEN PUTIN INTERVIEW????
[3:35:02] H2oJacKle: auto cannon is sick
[3:35:03] Middors: @Wallytreats that's what I'm saying. Finally someone gets it
[3:35:06] CaveMan_2024: que "stop having fun" meme
[3:35:07] Hierbie: DEMOCRACY!
[3:35:08] moldedbythedark: @middors if games followed your idea of $1 per hour majority of games would be boring 70 hour games to justify charging $70.
[3:35:09] GarraOmega: Chat gaslighting others when there's not a lick of nagativity KEKW

[3:43:20] BigMahk_: sense*
[3:43:21] CaveMan_2024: Helldivers 2 is based on Helldivers 1
[3:43:23] ItzTheNoid: Starship Troopers was based on Nazi propaganda
[3:43:25] GarraOmega: Battle Pass has guns???
[3:43:32] btbamfan3: is this the game? looking at skins in menus?

[3:44:06] js1994_: so p2w lol
[3:44:07] xNomaddic: oh look p2w afterall
[3:44:07] CaveMan_2024: it's just a game
[3:44:09] tachikoma1337: p2w?
[3:44:10] JuggerNot_76: @BariNgozi It's a lot more tactical/strategic than left 4 dead because you have to coordinate different load outs with teammates depending on the mission
[3:44:11] Ziz1243: With Super Credits you can gain Super Credits from simply playing though!
[3:44:15] HighBorNate: Is this destiny 3
[3:44:16] Mrcubix17: 40$ and you still have to spend OMEGALUL

[3:44:50] CaveMan_2024: shroud havin fun 👍
[3:44:51] lordzpunisher: jerbifScared
[3:44:51] thebrand238: why are people obsessed with the term pay to win lmfao, especially on a pve game with no leaderboards

[3:44:55] moldedbythedark: @drobzzz winning is winning Kappa
[3:44:55] Mrcubix17: @moldedbythedark you didn't have to go through a battlepass in the first game

[3:47:18] essteedeenz: Honestly the fact that so many people have complained about this game over nothing its whats wrong with gaming and tbh
[3:47:19] Kispa1: Just look at Payday 2. Pve game with so many cheaters
[3:47:22] pervasivepech: you guys can unlock everything ingame easily idk why anyones calling it p2w. you can find 1-5$ worth of ingame currency PER MISSION. You basically are just paying to support the devs
[3:47:24] pri5tinesky9: People would complain if it's a free game 🤣
[3:47:27] theoutcast_plays: @AceOfHalo2 Its more than 40.  59.99 USD if you want the citizen edition, 80 CAD.

[3:47:29] dorkk5: Every multiplayer video game should be that level of anti cheat honestly
[3:47:34] dem_nyxd: @Tabneto i recall most player on the first one do have cheats because the leaderboards on proving grounds are insanely short time cleared.
[3:47:36] CaveMan_2024: let people have fun

[3:47:48] CaveMan_2024: it's okay to have fun.
[3:47:53] DragonWarden9: You unlock stuff in part 2 the same way you unlock in part 1. Level up, get points, spend it on  upgrades. They just changed the name of the unlocks to warbonds

[3:47:58] pervasivepech: @AndreMacassi god forbid people play a game and have fun for a week
[3:48:02] Ziz1243: The craziest kernel level anti cheat available I had to stop so many programs because it did not like it. I had "hack attempt detected 1013" multiple times. It was SystemExplorer or ISLC but honestly I could care less that stuff only helps with games like CS2.
[3:48:08] CaveMan_2024: not having fun? that's okay too.

[3:48:16] BariNgozi: @AndreMacassi You don't have to enjoy it, but you look like a complete loser praying on the downfall of a new game
[3:48:19] thebrand238: @shewtrr literally, the reviews I read are absurd, I haven't seen a single negative review about actual gameplay

[4:01:15] CxlbyCDO: is this related to star wars? thats clearly an at-st lmao
[4:01:16] cedricdube: there is friendly fire so its technically pvp
[4:01:21] Aluja77: @imaginashunz absolutely not, SWBF2 was also 3rd person
[4:01:21] JaramonPrime: @koshburger but instead of top down isometric they made it 3rd person

[4:43:49] YashParker23: Hey hey hey Shroud!✋
[4:43:49] evinafk: this game deserves to be very positive on steam easily
[4:43:54] VincentVanGoat: In my personal opinion this game represents the true evolution of the gaming ecosystem. What visceral gameplay, what excellent design, what inspired style. The intersection of all of this gives birth to potentially the greatest media experience ever devised by mankind.
[4:43:56] diokhane: is this game trash???
[4:43:56] EZjuanVjuan: i returned it after 56 minutes

[4:44:37] dem_nyxd: live yes
[4:44:37] gassyrassy: there should be a guy up at the ship he could be like the AC-130!!

[4:44:47] EximusNine: yes
[4:44:47] H0ll0w1x: its about time we got a super troopers game
[4:44:47] OneLuckyDuck1: everytime you beat a mission it gives a percentage towards capturing the planet eventually they fight back and have new strategies
[4:44:47] ylimani: you make 0.001 changes

[4:44:49] persehavitaja69: @shroud whats the name of your helmet? 󠀀

[4:44:56] xdniceguy: the aliens push back
[4:44:56] toesTV: very odd
[4:44:57] Volti_UK: Happened in the first one
[4:44:58] corusame: The devs have said that the players success will have a direct impact on the overall war effort which will unlock new events
[4:44:59] ZaevuOfficial: !song
[4:45:00] XavierDaBoy: Hello @shroud how are you?
[4:45:00] mikeful: there is probably some instant ivasions
[4:45:02] dem_nyxd: there are occasional event of enemies pushing super earth
[4:45:02] EximusNine: you can lose but that only happens if not enough people win
[4:45:02] Drobzzz: @flowktro ?????
[4:45:03] OneLuckyDuck1: then new sectors unlock
[4:45:03] jebussssss: @flowktro yes
[4:45:04] goatedaffect: you can lose
[4:45:07] Zheo_Verticies: Its more a cutscene if you lose and cutscene if you win, at least in the last one it was that way
[4:45:08] akshatkumar89: @shroud orbital laser strike auto aims mobs for 20sec.. its really good...
[4:45:08] OneLuckyDuck1: it will be a back and fourth
[4:45:09] Tr4v1sCZ: you can defend earth if they push back a lot
[4:45:09] magzony: is this worth giving it a ride single player ?

[4:45:16] Jdmzenny: @VincentVanGoat ok sony advertisement relax
[4:45:17] evinafk: @notjackk it is tho
[4:45:20] lawrenceb34: @kaiwilhelm11 our reality already doesn't align due to the fact that my opinion will differ from yours
[4:45:27] VincentVanGoat: @Jdmzenny you are watching one
[4:45:28] EximusNine: earth? whats that? is that like super earth?
[4:45:28] Ernimus_Prime: @shroud Is there a lot of content?
[4:45:37] Jdmzenny: @VincentVanGoat nah im watching shroud

[4:55:15] wofguy: so this is just deep rock galactic but without dwarves?
[4:55:18] just_a_bad_spawn: @consgaming21 democracy
[4:55:20] Milanovichh: @Un1tyPr1mus It just makes it faster, thats were you pay for
[4:55:21] Protomateria: @m1gzm there is a minimap if you press tab

[4:55:58] Milanovichh: @Un1tyPr1mus true, there is no point, but for some it will and they will pay
[4:55:58] kkmoney15: @GubbinsCS so you just burst in the door and start asking questions lol
[4:55:59] TarzGG: Its better than risk of rain IMO but I think that comes down to personal preference. Its the most enjoyable game I have played in some time. I thought it would be boring but its just good fun, challenging and runs really well. Can't speak on the whole Nprotect saga as no one has taken over my PC yet
[4:56:01] Un1tyPr1mus: @Milanovichh your screeching about ptw when theres nothing to win or progress to in this game
[4:56:04] JoshimiUK: I love DRG but Helldivers came before it
[4:56:08] iretrasado: @eximus9 You can apply that logic to anything lmao. Why are you attempting to justify micro transactions in a pve coop game LUL obviously gamer gate didnt prevent chuds like you from entering the scene

[4:56:21] AWildWesAppears: @ongebear that's where your gun is currently pointing. Think like War Thunder's reticles

[4:58:39] twodecks: @imsohollow you just downloaded it but you already know it’s fun ?
[4:58:40] PhatBear1: @imsohollow i've heard its quite difficult to play solo
[4:58:41] Hedge18: Big thing in Helldivers 1 as well with higher difficulties with my friend was learning to just run away when they call reinforcements. Especially the bugs will overrun you eventually when all the supplies have been used
[4:58:43] Jdmzenny: @imsohollow you just downloaded it bro no reviews as chat said till you hit 50 hours sorry
[4:58:45] EximusNine: and the extra stuff you can get for MTX are optional and mostly cosmetic, and if you really want them you can earn shop currency by just playing the game
[4:58:48] ynzaen: is it the same arrow code to spawn every time or does it vary?

[4:59:04] lawrenceb34: @Un1tyPr1mus fucking are you yelling about pay to progress.... alll one has to do is play the game to progress no pay walls
[4:59:10] topea87: @imsohollow I wasnt expecting it to be so good, met two guys and squaded up for like 3 hours.
[4:59:13] Dev_24: @kj03069 live service = battlepass
[4:59:14] Jesse294_: how is it pls tell me it’s good chat?
[4:59:16] imsohollow: Just saying it for what it is guys personally I'm enjoying it, most games these days are ass
[4:59:18] blastboys123: is this just like a wave shooter
[4:59:21] masterorc15: you've been gone too long in the midnight sea :)
[4:59:30] Un1tyPr1mus: @Milanovichh if there is no ability to compare yourself to other players in direct combat, progress becomes irrelevant because there is no competition, progress is just a completely individual thing
[4:59:31] paulbryantv: how do you customise colour of armour?
[4:59:34] EximusNine: even in games without MTX it isnt free, you just spend time instead of money
[4:59:34] Milanovichh: @AWildWesAppears I believe you., but there is a mechanism in this game to pay for things which give you a buff, left or right
[4:59:36] Ramstein: @kj03069 Live Service = they can suck more money out of you more often
[4:59:38] DarkJezter: cod zombies meets starship toopers
[4:59:39] AWildWesAppears: @blastboys123 slightly more involved than a wave shooter but similar
[4:59:43] EximusNine: literally nothing is free
[4:59:46] ynzaen: the weapons chunk in this game
[4:59:48] iretrasado: @eximus9 I understand that but if they're going with the whole "muh mtx funding" why even make the game $40 in the first point?
[4:59:52] TrustPink: The thing is. The longer a mission goes on. The more enemies come and the more agressive they get.
[4:59:55] Milanovichh: @Un1tyPr1mus Why ingame currency with buffs armor?
[4:59:55] omarali322: Yo chat this or Warhammer Space Marine 2 ?
[4:59:59] EximusNine: @iretrasado probably Sony, honestly
[5:00:06] ccubed92: @imsohollow it's a lot of good games now days but your preference  is probably just narrow or your just picking the wrong games that doesn't fit your taste
