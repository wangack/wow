[3:08:26] Sawftw: if u get shadowword death u oneshot everything @JokerdTV
[3:08:29] Tjamen: make water give stam and spirit
[3:08:35] 21up21: No way, that would be OP
[3:08:42] Boothill: Keep it 2 and afk sell all day
[3:08:42] MDHippie: But against what rune would that be competing? Sounds kinda weird
[3:08:57] overkillz666: playing rrly close
[3:09:02] slug_22: And wouldn't affect out boomer brains to keybind more abilities
[3:09:03] nicolai_original: @MDHippie U are getting new rune slots next phase
[3:09:06] overkillz666: zoom out <3
[3:09:09] slug_22: Our*
[3:09:11] el_savic: just make a rune that deletes hunter pets when they attack you :D
[3:09:11] keduoh: or just give mana table
[3:09:14] hairsbears213: could have dumb runes for rings and neck pieces so you could increase shaman wep chants, no cost for slow fall, faster rogue poison to weps,etc
[3:09:18] botjuan1: that's actually a good idea
[3:09:23] Exusprime: Its a non combat rune, duh
[3:09:23] Mybhomie: You can swap runes anyway
[3:09:24] 420promemer: wouldnt runes like that force you to keep changing them? like equip water rune --> make water, equip buff rune --> buff party etc
[3:09:24] Ollan: hey @JokerdTV /pray or /kneel at the graveyard
[3:09:28] TahoooB: Classic arenas
[3:09:29] ghanoben_6191: new charchter in living flame ?

[3:09:46] nicolai_original: @MDHippie they showed it in a video
[3:09:52] tamtamrane: It's also part of the classic gameplay to ask pally for buff every 5 minutes
[3:09:52] botjuan1: dang thats true
[3:09:57] nicolai_original: @MDHippie i can find it 1sec
[3:10:03] Godrick85: mage  gamepley being a vendor
[3:10:07] ShingaTV: ask warlocks... :D
[3:10:09] ballballplays: no changes ReallyMad
[3:10:11] 21up21: no shot bro.  if we have to take the zeppelin to get from Org to UC, you guys can spend a few hours clicking to prep water for raid
[3:10:15] Trastar12: no innovate for mages with table
[3:10:19] canezzy: MEMERI
[3:10:20] Exusprime: They wont remove the friction of Mages being a vendor machine
[3:10:20] TahoooB: would you vote for classic Arenas ?
[3:10:20] hapjaa: Okayeg
[3:10:22] shadowcaelic: i want a paladin rune for buffs to be more then 5min on ppl :)

[3:10:47] BaxxyChan: The only issue with warlock healthstones is that they are unique... hope they remove that restriction next phase
[3:10:54] 수줍은: HUHH
[3:11:05] DRoc__: what if it was like a rep with some rep gear, making it not based on how good you are but just playing a lot
[3:11:05] Trastar12: u can not balance this runes
[3:11:06] TahoooB: maybe mount reward?
[3:11:10] Ollan: joker pray at graveyard!
[3:11:11] tamtamrane: but they're perma nerfing hunter
[3:11:12] Trastar12: its not possible
[3:11:16] casualhertz: bro wheres your penance?
[3:11:17] Godrick85: so why they nerfing hunters because of pvp
[3:11:19] hairsbears213: could make it give rep until a certain level
[3:11:22] patrickthestarnew: yeah what about like cosmetic rewards, mounts

[3:11:24] Ravyga: source: trust me bro xff

[3:12:21] nach7vos: penance helps ALOT to lvl
[3:12:23] nach7vos: its low mana

[3:24:47] 420promemer: would you pay for cata+? maybe 20 yuro
[3:24:54] Trastar12: cata is easier compared to ulduar
[3:24:55] hairsbears213: think mop classic will be the biggest
[3:25:00] gdtomii: @Trastar12 ??????
[3:25:01] xperiment01: @Trastar12 I disagree. It was a blessing when u were cursed with the wrong stats
[3:25:02] shalomski: Main thing I liked in cata was 308 item lvl gear on lvl 78 alts
[3:25:02] Ravyga: @hairsbears213 this
[3:25:12] chumbawamba7: but way harder than wotlk
[3:25:15] tiguricus: ok
[3:25:17] Trastar12: MoP was the start of retail raiding

[3:26:43] dedrateroserasdom: cata has a very unique raiding because p1&p2 were completely different than p3. heroic chogall to rag are some real shits because you don't have all the tools in retail, and you goes oom very quickly with p1 gears
[3:26:43] chumbawamba7: tell me when is wotlk

[6:11:29] xmarcaurelx: @TafsirisMrMiyagi Which will almost never happen in open world pvp. The system itself is designed to be abused.

[6:12:31] TafsirisMrMiyagi: @xmarcaurelx It's up to each player if he wants to take those fights or not. I agree that the world encourages it. I never attack someone significantly lower level or outnumbered
[6:12:32] Trastar12: walking simulation :D
[6:12:32] Puppytime: I thought that most people have turned in pearls, so it's not going to be dropped often.

[6:13:54] toxicrouge120: We bought it everyday 400-500g each
[6:14:13] xmarcaurelx: @TafsirisMrMiyagi Obviously. I am just stating the effect of open world pvp on humans, especially hardcore pvp'ers, in general.  The principle of a just fight isn't applicable on that case unfortunately (for most fights, not for every fight).

[6:15:24] gio57qke: the movementspeedbuff is mandatory to level imo
[6:15:30] TafsirisMrMiyagi: I think if you have no problem levelling a char to 60 for one world buff, I think they will not be bothered about having to clear BFD
[6:15:33] argybis: Mounts tho

[6:21:12] Kuda1000: WHAT
[6:21:13] ZapaxOnTwitch: they use the same client for sod and era server. So they can only balance via runes
[6:21:20] piro_d: @nincompoop__dude xddkiss
[6:21:21] Skadoros: avr hunter is doing better then avrg warrior in bfd. its just the sweatlord warriors doing insane dmg
[6:21:24] Prevara96: @JokerdTV just balancing the outliers is important
[6:21:26] Trastar12: str = ap / int = mana thats the problem

[6:22:03] smaftyz: wonder if shadow priests will be viable for a single week throughout all of SoD
[6:22:09] FIREMAGZZ: there just gonna make rogues god tier like always and we’re gonna have to accept it
[6:22:17] lecorsairr: just make content harder and tankier

[6:22:44] WaffletheMan101: give them utility runes
[6:22:46] gio57qke: meeles were always weapon/gear dependent
[6:22:50] Trastar12: all the stats for meele are made around dealing damage while casters are build around doing the dmg just longer
[6:22:50] Dissolution187: HUHA
[6:22:53] beezelbuub: they need so much set up
[6:23:02] Tjamen: rogue
[6:23:06] xmarcaurelx: The balance should just focus on meeting a threshold so every class can do the content with ease. How much easier it is for certain classes shouldnt be an issue.
[6:23:09] gdkpgold: what lvl is your priest
[6:23:11] Coltify: saber slash melts
[6:23:11] beezelbuub: priest must use homunc, need to get rage mobs etc
[6:23:12] aty_13: Because it's 1 button
[6:23:14] Bootyshortz: cuz rogue is literally 1 button
[6:23:18] fueego_: First
[6:23:19] Trastar12: because rogue needs less gear
[6:23:20] TafsirisMrMiyagi: ?????

[6:23:25] TafsirisMrMiyagi: Why should you care about someone that makes mistakes?

[6:23:30] just_a_slayer: Why should they care about the average though? The average person is like 80 IQ
[6:23:40] varyab: he yap  ing just to yap  Omegakek
[6:23:45] gio57qke: who cares about parses
[6:23:52] zatyna_: @just_a_slayer because the average raid has average players

[6:23:53] zatyna_: moron
[6:23:56] Flodimo: xd
[6:23:57] TafsirisMrMiyagi: It's not balance's fault if people can't press buttons. Only the #1 player matters

[6:26:15] bm01: @theradoor what he's saying is people find ways to "cheese" fights and make huge parse, like bringing someone to apply debuffs to let others go full dps. So the game shouldn't be balanced around parses
[6:26:15] xmarcaurelx: @TafsirisMrMiyagi How so? If the average person likes the game, why should it be a bad game? The game doesnt need to cater to the wow andys who play 4 hours a day.

Just that if you follow suggestions of people that don't know what they are talking about, then you don't get a good product.

[6:29:19] xmarcaurelx: @TafsirisMrMiyagi And there is the trap: the #1 player CAN give advise, doesn't mean that the advise is good for the average player.
