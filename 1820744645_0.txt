[1:17:32] Drunkinc: 28 F
[1:17:35] deadvesu: Mages tend to AOE grind in this spot so maybe they overpulled
[1:17:37] Razzlik: I leveled my warrior prot. Made it a challenge leveling but also got me into dungeons easy. No waiting. My warriors name is Meatshield
[1:18:08] HalfTrack_: I don’t think so
[1:18:25] its_jadj1014: jadj1014theog subscribed with Prime. 
[1:18:33] ucan: Saw you lurkin in sums chat last night, hes 36 now I think
[1:18:34] hellasketchy_og: @Razzlik surely has to do with their faction
[1:18:39] TuxionTV: I think it was possible before spell batching was reduced
[1:19:22] Zerofkgiven: do you use windfury?
[1:19:51] ucan: oh loll, thats cute though, you guys watch twitch on the tv together? I can 100% see you two backseat hating, like people watching in public LUL
[1:20:06] frizzletoothy: OMG IS THIS HARDCORE MODE
[1:20:18] frizzletoothy: WIAT WIAT WAIT WAIT
[1:20:25] frizzletoothy: IS THIS SHROUDS NEW GAME
[1:20:27] HalfTrack_: Youre not supposed to do it every swing is the big thing. Weaving if wind fury is on cooldown isn’t worth so that’s prob the most key thing to track. You can feel out the swing with slow weapons
[1:20:29] Zerofkgiven: what level do you get windfury on shaman?
[1:20:41] MetallFinn: When does HC come out
[1:20:47] genocy: enhance
[1:20:48] scubaklepter: level 30
[1:21:02] Aroumi: windfury is 32
[1:21:08] skywalk1411: chair stream
[1:21:18] ImNervo: !hc
[1:21:18] Fossabot: @ImNervo here are the rules for Hardcore https://classichc.net/rules/
[1:21:29] HalfTrack_: @zerofkgiven 30f for your weapon imbue and 32 for totem
[1:21:29] MetallFinn: Anyone know the release date for HC yet?
[1:21:33] pkprell: @shroud Not leveling like Elemental is kinda crazy, they got such good damage all the way thru, and you can drink while Duo kills a mob etc.
[1:21:38] frizzletoothy: WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT HOW TALL IS SHROUD
[1:21:47] scubaklepter: @Aroumi no its 30
[1:21:49] frizzletoothy: never seen him stand up on stream
[1:21:54] hermanweiss: 201 cm @frizzletoothy
[1:21:54] kirkyi: bro u play premier later?
[1:21:57] Zerofkgiven: @HalfTrack_ is it 30min buff on yourself?

[1:22:12] HalfTrack_: @frizzletoothy he’s 6 foot 5 inches
[1:22:12] Arpolo2: might as well since only pvp should be death duels
[1:22:15] genocy: ive been waiting for cross faction since like 2010
[1:22:17] Waldsprenger: !deaths
[1:22:18] devmerr: imagine dwarf shamans
[1:22:25] frizzletoothy: ok he can be my BF FOR SURE
[1:22:31] Dopenose: @HalfTrack_ 2 seperate measurements?
[1:22:33] pineapple_club: Trussy
[1:22:37] MangoPickle: people asking about official hc here than going on their site to check is hilarious LUL
[1:22:40] MrZomb1es: Id say only like 35% chance they do that though
[1:22:44] triplezro: did u watch liquids world first kill today
[1:22:44] FoxFiveZA: hc makes sense tho
[1:22:56] rookie286: bur horde sucks tho
[1:22:57] devmerr: agreed
[1:23:02] Lucky_Barbarian: hardcore battlegrounds
[1:23:04] blurTTV: shroudDab

[1:23:06] HalfTrack_: @dopenose yah NA measurements.  We are wild over here
[1:23:08] itsCloaker: they should open all races and classes too just pick a classic starting zone
[1:23:09] doomed_jackass: the amount of gatekeeping post announcement is hilarious. So many andy's LUL
[1:23:09] rubby_ducker: that would be a way better solution than adding pala / sham on each faction

[1:23:24] strawberry_nerd: Faction tribalism is so stupid in 2023
[1:23:26] FoxFiveZA: no more grief as well that would be awesome for streamers too
[1:23:31] banshay3: @elohzi early not, so many players
[1:23:36] genocy: it should just be a toggle, when you want to pvp turn it on, otherwise why restrict yourself and your friends and shit
[1:23:37] nickelius: Wf might make ret Paladins viable then
[1:23:40] MangoPickle: @metallfinn no its not just funny to me you can just check official website imo
[1:24:02] Dahoman23: take pvp out entiraly is misstake imo
[1:24:04] Flame_sa: OMG!😩 you look good 🤪
[1:24:22] mandurilxl: ravager vs ww axe
[1:24:28] MangoPickle: monkaHmm
[1:24:30] HalfTrack_: Enhance shaman would be good with salv and wisdom
[1:24:34] hatad: doesnt fit with story
[1:24:45] mandurilxl: LUL
[1:24:46] w33dn0se: what happened to the gray man server on dayz?
[1:24:54] Zijkrial: @hatad henyatBonk
[1:25:04] TKraus27: is this a trio then?
[1:25:09] lililshgo: is HC classic or wrath?
[1:25:27] banshay3: @elohzi as if anyone is flagged on purpose
[1:25:29] HalfTrack_: You could also totem twist with mama effectiveness
[1:25:36] HalfTrack_: Increasing value.
[1:25:37] tool545: @lililshgo both
[1:25:45] Zijkrial: Well Classic could benefit from a few changes, that being one of 'em.
[1:25:55] Oztington: if they dont delete
[1:25:57] genocy: he ragequit bro
[1:26:01] genocy: no it's there until he resses
[1:26:01] PELD3S: he never releaser prob
[1:26:02] Lucky_Barbarian: forever until they delete character
[1:26:03] Nadool: maintenance they go away or something
[1:26:05] rubby_ducker: if they don't delete the character, it will stay indefinitely
[1:26:06] genocy: if its hc it might be there forever
[1:26:16] kumbayaa666: cant you skip that quest , its not worth
[1:26:22] doomed_jackass: I'm ready for more Dungeon Masters killing griefer clips. That one who got teleported to Winterspring and fell was amazing LUL
[1:26:22] Arpolo2: gets wiped on maintenance days

[1:31:29] Zijkrial: I remember getting WF back in 2006. Was magical. But yeah FT more consistent.
[1:31:29] bluntdino: every x seconds xd
[1:31:30] seriespsychoo: isnt rockbite the best?
[1:31:32] Glenlol: @hatad yh in classic its the most consistent dps

[1:36:52] Bradspacely: 15 agi is from trainer
[1:37:02] HalfTrack_: Atlas loot should show a recipe if it requires one. If no recipe is shown it’s trained.

[1:39:33] xhairbait: oooh not stop my bad,
[1:40:06] rubby_ducker: slam has a lower cast time than the weapon swing time, so if you time it right after your weapon swing its technically more dps than white attack if you need to dump rage

[1:51:58] Lava1Rain: I wonder why they don’t have the Paladin or Crusader class anymore in Diablo4?
[1:52:16] mokhlesss: !addons
[1:52:16] Fossabot: @mokhlesss Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[1:52:19] ReaperDaDemon: did shroud diedge?
[1:52:28] fantaaaa: because they want to sell expansions @lava1rain
[1:52:34] Roxxiie: Its such a shame that enhancer in classic is only fun and good while lvling
[1:52:40] zenreality: @lava1rain because they introduce them later to make more $$$
[1:52:43] Zerofkgiven: @Lava1Rain they replaced it with druid LUL
[1:52:51] rubby_ducker: level 20 for the average player (not a speedrunner) is probably 20-25 hours
[1:52:52] HalfTrack_: I think 20 is high for the hardcore player base. I have heard from other hardcore streamers that most people die between like 15-25 or something like that.
[1:52:53] hamaatv: @shroud when do u get windfury totem?
[1:52:57] richii4k: What do you mean by Offical HC @shroud

[1:53:49] Bone_Spurs: dun geon time
[1:53:51] exoscorpion_: i thought you were streaming wed
[1:53:57] Lava1Rain: I heard the Druid class isn’t that good. I only played Sorcerer during the server slam so I can’t say.
[1:53:59] rubby_ducker: @sheisty_one if we talkin bg's ele could one shot people with chain > ele mastery chain > bolt
[1:54:06] funkasation: if u die in dungeon it's game over?

[1:57:37] AJBungah: just got melted by geomancers near kreenig at lvl 13

[2:22:44] SgtOddity: Im just excited by the economy potential. Selling low lvl items on the AH will actually be relevant. Inflation will be really low as well.

[2:26:56] badd_77: why don't you find Valorant interesting? is there any particular reason?
[2:26:58] Trenki_: cmon spoil smth to us
[2:27:01] officialchoom: @shroud when did you start playing WoW?
[2:27:02] lycen1: Get your ass in there and start telling people what to do, thats definitely the answer
[2:27:03] Superherbie: what server is this?
[2:27:07] Trenki_: we wanna know about this gamo
[2:27:08] sillonar: Yeah Be like Respawn and brag about finishing your game earlier than usually and make it run like horse shit. Kappa
[2:27:19] Macserinho: 5 mins normally
[2:27:23] DirtySince90: f2p would bring so many more bots
[2:27:30] menics: @shroud what happend to EFT for you ? i thought u enjoyed it pretty hard....
[2:27:33] chummyshaman: just sub is good, the game suffers from bots as is
[2:27:35] Cloak__ttv: !primier
[2:27:52] EMITT: cant wait for official for that reason
[2:27:53] RIFZERA: Why don’t u like valorant?
[2:27:55] lycen1: If FF14 will go FTP before WoW
[2:28:00] officialchoom: official will be great for that
[2:28:03] HalfTrack_: I think wow classic should have a separate sub $5 a month. And port it to consoles as a free to download game that you can test play to level 20
[2:28:14] ItsGary: Tell your voidwalker to stand on her spawn and then spam void walker attack in a macro with her name
[2:28:14] noobmaster4587: Next valorant premiere match when??
[2:28:15] Cloak__ttv: !premier
[2:28:18] imsynning: Will his game be on steam or his own site kinda thing?
[2:28:21] igorra_: Does corruption not have an insta dmg tick in classic?
[2:28:25] HalfTrack_: But still be included in your regular sub if you play retail.
[2:28:25] jedisquirrel93: Is there any afk leveling in WOW?
[2:28:50] MangoPickle: NODDERS
[2:29:00] officialchoom: its better like that, gives more variety @shroud 100% agree
[2:29:02] serjunious: true
[2:29:07] Setriath: can confirm
[2:29:09] jedisquirrel93: Package deal
[2:29:10] HalfTrack_: I feel like retail would be to hard to port to console though. That’s why I would separate it.
[2:29:12] Fledrik: I'd rather pay for convenience
[2:29:13] menics: @shroud what happend to EFT for you ? i thought u enjoyed it pretty hard....
[2:29:13] igorra_: why would they give classic for free?
[2:29:15] Denudation: Yes, But moneies Sadge
[2:29:17] shin_hong: LUL
[2:29:22] HalfaXan: retail would die instantly when classic would be free
[2:29:23] HalfTrack_: Classic on console would be big money
[2:29:23] ItsGary: People have an idea that "Classic" isnt a full game compared to retail so it shouldnt be a full sub cost.   Two completely different games.
[2:29:25] TootinFresh: !monitor

[2:29:30] igorra_: Like how would they even stay profitable classic doesnt have much of a store lmao
[2:29:35] tromic: just go play some dog pserver if you want free
[2:29:36] alanbioo1: can we try wow classic to to level  20 ?
[2:29:43] adarooski: free classic = more bots; no thanks
[2:29:45] Senpax: Retail with buying the current expansion is already hard enough for some people to understand
[2:29:49] Ricmaniac: @alanbioo1 noo
[2:29:49] klenis: its all ogre
[2:29:58] ItsGary: @igorra_ Subs are the most profitable income for wow not the store
[2:30:01] roniyan_s: Hii Shroud
[2:30:08] Sheep: It will spawn in 4 mins
[2:30:17] ItsGary: Is that not her at the back in the black? :P
[2:30:28] Doemaster11: is there an addon that shows all vendors in retail?
[2:30:33] mandurilxl: chain rain of fire KEKW @shroud

[2:31:00] Luwuna__: my horny ass could never work at a zoo
[2:31:01] sanyassan: EZ
[2:31:03] lycen1: I think WoW should add one big sub for all their games, like PsPlus or Xbox
[2:31:10] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[2:31:18] BubbIeGuttz: @shroud do you mouse wheel tag?

[2:32:20] Gorilazz12: Can you still pay in game gold for the subscription ? and how much?
[2:32:21] Setriath: @F1ddlez Might be the play Microsoft goes for. One subscription for everything
[2:32:22] lycen1: D4
[2:32:22] iamRichard: Just mouse wheel tag with melee or pet melee, the first swing is always instant 😉
[2:32:23] Fragglevision: @F1ddlez isn't it only WoW that requires a sub?
[2:32:26] GrannyApple: did he die on his shamy?
[2:32:28] igorra_: @F1ddlez cod wow hots, diablo ow

[2:33:26] johnthelongdon: They should do a gamepass ultimate + for wow sub and game pass as soon as they are owned by xbox
[2:33:28] samiwamiAEYOE: Are the broys coming on, or we doing solo dolo? @shroud
[2:33:29] akajry: i honestly don't think game pass makes Microsoft that much money on its own
[2:33:30] imsynning: Which platform your game gonna be on?
[2:33:42] ItsGary: They wouldnt make as much.  How many games do you play for longer then 6-7 months?
[2:33:44] Captain_Rax: can we just not do subs, for non live service games, k thx, that shits stupid
[2:33:48] Setriath: Everything is turning into a subscription these days :(
[2:33:51] tydr1m: @shroud become a hearthstone streamer bro YEP
[2:33:52] AwFeel: Nintendo has that but new releases are still purchaseables
[2:33:56] HalfaXan: @GrannyApple nothing ska is raiding
[2:34:09] lycen1: These companies LOVE subs, I dont understand how they make money, I played Jedi for 20 bucks instead of paying 90
[2:34:11] Fragglevision: @ItsGary well I've played WoW and counter-strike since the early stages of both....
[2:34:18] GrannyApple: the best pricing for a game, would be the way CSGO does it, skins from the marketplace @shroud
[2:34:30] Thermagorash: hit 20, took on the brissleback geomancers in the south, died :( be careful if you attack those ones they slap and have a fire immune ward
[2:34:33] Mystic_Delta: It might happen if Microsoft integrates Wow in Gamepass
[2:34:40] Fragglevision: valorant needs a stat tracker on weapons
[2:34:49] johnthelongdon: All blizz Main games gonna be on xbox game pass anywyay. Lets see what they do with wow Sub then
[2:34:58] mandogbrodude: qtcSmoke
[2:35:02] ItsGary: @Fragglevision 2 games.   All the other games you have played cost on averaged 50-60.  if you play them for 2 months its only 2 months of sub
[2:35:04] gerkins860: gerkins860 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! i miss greyman
[2:35:07] Mostynn: What's the quest addon he's using?
[2:35:11] ezkng_: you knw they shuld just make everything free :)
[2:35:16] AwFeel: If they wanted is in the game longer they would prioritize the leveling process not deleting old content by making it obsolete with new "expansions"
[2:35:21] Thee_Savage_Cabbage: If WoW becomes free to play would it gain a huge following??
[2:35:23] inspiredtv: @Mostynn restedxp

[2:35:25] GrannyApple: instead of paying for a game, should make you invest into the game, just like most games with skins/MTX
[2:35:28] Sximii: !crosshair
[2:35:33] Harvister7: id have so many friends actually trying wow if there wasnt a monthly fee ):

[2:35:46] Fragglevision: @Fragglevision luckily I don't game hop all that much, so I've gotten my monies worth (though I don't like a sub, I don't mind paying it for 1 game)
[2:35:53] inspiredtv: @scottishjarl voiceover

[2:36:00] HalfaXan: @Thee_Savage_Cabbage probably yea but blizz would go bankcrupt
[2:36:00] GrannyApple: trial is from lv1-20
[2:36:01] goblinjerkey23: only to 20
[2:36:02] 3r4th: till lvl 20 is free, not classic tho

[2:36:05] SlDDYY: Retail only
[2:36:08] KazakiTV: not for classic
[2:36:09] gerkins860: !hardcore
[2:36:09] Fossabot: @gerkins860 here are the rules for Hardcore https://classichc.net/rules/
[2:36:11] Hezor9: not for Classic :/
[2:36:15] igorra_: bruh its 15 for classic and no expac
[2:36:21] druxynt: they gave me two weeks free randomly im not a new player tho
[2:36:23] naan_sense: Havent played since mist of pandaria, nostalgia
[2:36:34] akajry: Booster Boosters
[2:36:34] harleyirish: No post or ah on the free trial either
[2:36:35] Jixxerrrr: Thats why Riot is so good
[2:36:36] Mapthesoul: Path of Exile only has cosmetics no?
[2:36:38] Nori_Chee: i can imagine all the bots
[2:36:38] ToastarN: I mean xp boosts are already a thing but yea
[2:36:38] hadouken300: and 10 times more the bots
[2:36:39] Tecni: Retail has that anyway
[2:36:40] ghostXshell: they already have insta level boosts lol
[2:36:40] themostfowl: already everywhere anyways
[2:36:41] Tophhafn: yep
[2:36:42] Captain_Rax: payed m+ key rerolls
[2:36:42] Tailslide50: Star wars old republic free to play only pissed you off
[2:36:44] Subpounder91: Look at swtor. Free has to pay for literally more space in bank etc
[2:36:47] noman_lives: Ever since Destiny 2 went f2p it turned to sh1t....
[2:36:57] Harvister7: guess i never thought of it that way
[2:36:59] mrn0n0n0: @Mapthesoul and stash tabs
[2:37:00] holteenderrob: !addons
[2:37:01] Fossabot: @chr0nic_painz Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[2:37:02] I_Devious_I: @Mapthesoul no, you can buy hideouts and premium stash tabs are practically a requirement
[2:37:12] auhsoj18: this game should just be a bonus to retail, they're sitting on residuals at this point. SOM is barely content
[2:37:14] Rahger: The closest we are gunna get to free is it being included in the Xbox thing
[2:37:17] tydr1m: but cmon now 63 bucks for a game thats been out for 15 years is a bit overkill xd
[2:37:21] aralin_mandolin: you can see a lot of content in the wow trial
[2:37:35] igorra_: @tydr1m bruh the expansion came out a few months ago
[2:37:42] ChieveMoe: whats the quest give
[2:37:42] ezkng_: there n trial fr classic
[2:37:42] Subpounder91: Having to pay for new xpacs on top of sub fee takes the biscuit tho
[2:37:48] 6foot4RowsForUCD: get the flight path?
[2:37:49] aralin_mandolin: but them monthly fee is really rough. idk how you can make that argument when any other game you only pay once for
[2:37:53] Fossabot: @t1m0tej1, Looking for his sensitivity for a specific game? Type the game name and sens - like !valorantsens or !apexsens
[2:37:54] DrasseL: How long until official did they say
[2:37:54] AwFeel: F2P means bots generally speaking and WoW has an awful record for that already
[2:37:55] tydr1m: @tydr1m in general im not talking about this one expac
[2:38:07] ItsGary: Its not 63 bucks for a 15 year old game though.    Its constantly changing.
[2:38:10] ChieveMoe: no that makes sense, lets do it then
[2:38:12] Fossabot: @t1m0tej1 Valorant: Sens: 0.8/Scoped 1 | DPI: 400 - Windows: 6/11 - Raw-Input: On - 1000 Hz Polling Rate

[2:38:21] bendik117: Hei
[2:38:23] Ttangko: Chat, this a hardcore run?
[2:38:23] DrasseL: @SirGlaux thanks
[2:38:28] tydr1m: 50 bucks for the xpac and 13 bucks for the sub when has it changed
[2:38:31] Dox023: Done with the duo for the day @shroud ?
[2:38:38] druxynt: the blizzard guy said a few weeks??

[2:39:10] Dox023: @fe1gn_ the blizzard guy said a few weeks for the official hc ptr. He said later this summer for the actual launch of official hc.
[2:39:31] druxynt: @Dox023 u right u right
[2:39:38] Sheepfu: Did they give any details other than release timing
[2:39:52] ItsGary: It will be right in the middle of the content drought for Diablo 4 and wow.   August.
[2:39:52] rainsomemore: duel to the death
[2:39:55] Dox023: @kas50 yeah, I know how to count lol. I just didn’t know if they were taking a break for a bit and then Tyler would return. I just turned the stream back on my dude.
[2:40:01] iTriedSniping: what leveling guide is he using chat?
[2:40:14] zeslays: autopilot
[2:40:39] Kas50: @Dox023 well Tyler is doing a 10man raid but yeah probs back later

[2:40:40] Fossabot: @dizzyy1600 he's been live for 2 hours and 40 minutes
[2:40:43] Nosdunk24: @tydr1m dragonflight is the latest expac. You said it was 60 bucks for a 15 year old game. And its not. Its 60 bucks for a game thats less than a year old
[2:40:48] akajry: oof
[2:40:50] ShauIean: f
[2:41:05] Dox023: @kas50 cool, thanks for letting me know.
[2:41:12] areiseye: @iTriedSniping some in game add-on
[2:41:12] Victinhokeno: No it's a 15 year old game lmfao
[2:41:16] Libertas09: Yeah classic is only $15/month
[2:41:25] Victinhokeno: And you pay so you can pay for monthly fee xD
[2:41:52] akajry: @Victinhokeno Why do you care?
[2:42:01] leogandolf: this is classic ?
[2:42:02] Nosdunk24: Dragonflight is not 15 years old lol
[2:42:05] very_grey: People trash on $15/month but F2P MMO's are garbage filled with pay to win elements and bots.
[2:42:08] Mapthesoul: Only rich people can play WoW yes we get it Kappa
[2:42:17] dejavupro: 15$ a month its 0.25$ per day played. If you cant afford that u better start working
[2:42:28] tydr1m: @Nosdunk24 dragonflight, bfa, shadowlands its all wow its only an expac with the same price yes each expac is diff from the other but the price is still a bit high
[2:42:34] gerkins860: been paying $15 a month since 2004
[2:42:40] druxynt: how am i gonna work if i need to grind levels
[2:42:44] LawnRaptor: ^

[2:43:08] Nirouku01: this is when someone should train the dragon into ORG.
[2:43:11] Nosdunk24: @tydr1m I agree the price is high. But each xpac is basically a new game. Its not like we are paying 60 bucks for classic wow over and over

[2:43:29] fedich99_99: !member
[2:43:30] Dox023: @grayfingers to be fair retail WoW can be pay to win despite having a subscription. There are whales out there that will buy hundreds/thousands of dollars worth of tokens to sell for gold. Then they buy boes/consumables/etc.
[2:43:31] lhteaa: Seen too many hackers  back in the days ...its better this way
[2:43:34] fedich99_99: !membersince
[2:43:37] akajry: @Melothon i wouldn't start with classic if you're new
[2:43:40] dejavupro: 3r4th glad someone noticed
[2:43:45] ItsGary: Assuming you are a kid and parents are strict you could mow your neighbours gardens and give parents the money for a wow sub in a couple of hours.
[2:43:58] ItsGary: Assuming you are an adult and you cant afford it then you need to sort something out :3
[2:44:06] bloodborne60fpsplz: Retail, absolutely not. Classic, yes
[2:44:12] skulldrip: @shroud what's the addon showing how much mana you get back, combat start/stop, etc.
[2:44:16] dejavupro: retail lost a lot of magic
[2:44:16] harleyirish: SeemsGood
[2:44:21] tydr1m: @Nosdunk24 yes its constantly changing but we both agree that 50 bucks for an expac is a bit much considering you have to pay 13/month
[2:44:24] EMITT: @bloodborne60fpsplz retail is in a good spot rn honestly
[2:44:28] akajry: @skulldrip just looks like floating combat text which you can enable in the settings
[2:44:43] flashnickgg: LUL true
[2:44:43] HalfTrack_: I think classic is the best value for a new player. Very little to have to understand

[2:44:54] AwFeel: only KEKW
[2:44:58] Uncoolbenz: did he call wow .... stupid? REEEEEEEEEEEE
[2:44:58] bloodborne60fpsplz: @emitt no it’s not, it’s overdesigned nonsense lol. You have to have 15 add ons just to be functional
[2:44:59] rubby_ducker: only PepeLaugh

[2:45:04] HayatoF89: "only" 10k XD
[2:45:04] Nosdunk24: @Melothon perfect time to jump into retail wow. New season just started and this xpac is one of the best in a really long time. Classic is fun too just much much slower pace and more time consuming
[2:45:08] plym3: Not anymore
[2:45:08] BlastedNips: @Ricmaniac Oh yeah, those were the days.
[2:45:15] deckery0: wtf
[2:45:15] Alaziara: At least you played wow

[2:45:31] TealLantern: LUL

[2:45:38] harleyirish: Spent a shit ton on my pc played wow 90% of the time could have used a laptop lols
[2:45:39] scion741: @kalmah2112 r u a pro
[2:45:39] HalfaXan: hord questing ICANT
[2:45:40] HayatoF89: "its not a game, its world" =D
[2:45:43] fl0rpis: you can type /played
[2:45:48] lycen1: Cost of game and sub doesnt matter if you get your value for it. I personally hate FTP. New World has a decent compromise
[2:45:52] EMITT: @bloodborne60fpsplz it defs has been like that for a long time but currently it's making a lot of improvements :) You could argue Weakauras help u a lot but that's a huge part of classic/wotlk too
[2:45:53] aralin_mandolin: @ikrullen nah
[2:45:56] eath2201: is there an addons command?
[2:45:57] skulldrip: I have an original character that I still play. It has over 300 days /played
[2:46:04] tydr1m: what expac was the best in your opinion besides classic
[2:46:06] THE_LOCKERROOM: Dank
[2:46:10] Atomikus88: everyone trying to be like Shroud and levelling shammys
[2:46:11] dankmemes4u: oof, 36, that hurts
[2:46:18] irreality: lvl 59 death COPIUM
[2:46:22] N1ppe: shamans are one of the least played classes so of course their stat is also lower
[2:46:29] HalfaXan: shaman is the most dank class
[2:46:32] THE_LOCKERROOM: Classic all day
[2:46:35] harleyirish: Which expac do you have the most hours
[2:46:36] lhteaa: Max lvl in WoW classic?
[2:46:39] cheesed_bucktee: I think more shamans cause of you perhaps
[2:46:42] Mapthesoul: I only played until Wrath of the Lich King and then I quit LUL
[2:46:43] HelloRelax: so wait, is it only pvp deaths or any death you are out on?
[2:46:43] very_grey: I'd say WotLK, then Dragonflight honestly
[2:46:47] j0rdanx387: TBC is goated
[2:46:51] gabrielhenn: legion <3
[2:47:02] bluemoonGG: it was literally classic plus wasn't it? they had planned some of that content for a vanilla xpac
[2:47:03] THE_LOCKERROOM: Truein*
[2:47:04] Nosdunk24: wrath is basically just retail lite
[2:47:04] MangoPickle: like 4090 to 4090ti KEKW
[2:47:05] bloodborne60fpsplz: That’s why tbc is my favorite, wrath just turned it into a dungeon crawler
[2:47:05] TealLantern: Warth or MOP for me
[2:47:10] lycen1: Classic Wow is actually Classic after two years of Development, it was NOT in a good state at Launch
[2:47:14] Ryuko198: legion>DF>Cata>mop>wrath for me
[2:47:16] skulldrip: MoP is the goat, I don't care what anyone says
[2:47:19] ItsGary: MOP was when I quit.
[2:47:19] igorra_: firelands was goated
[2:47:22] hewton1: Wish the HC hype was wrath and not Vanilla
[2:47:26] aralin_mandolin: LUL
[2:47:29] shaggy462: same
[2:47:29] flashnickgg: NOTED
[2:47:30] arctew: Would you say wrath is the best story wise with Arthas being the villain?
[2:47:31] dankmemes4u: it is dark and gritty
[2:47:32] samiwamiAEYOE: How? KEKW
[2:47:33] HelloRelax: @Ryuko198 MoP over wotlk??????
[2:47:40] MangoPickle: Madge
[2:47:41] lhteaa: MoP is goatedGlitchCat
[2:47:42] dankmemes4u: you're not wrong mike
[2:47:43] very_grey: MoP got kind of dark at the end
[2:47:44] HalfaXan: wrath or legion were the best
[2:47:44] cheesed_bucktee: How did you get so much rested XP already wtf
[2:47:44] BlastedNips: Well, it was that way in the lore for the longest time, especially in the RTS games. Orcs and humans killing each other, and demons killing both of them.
[2:47:45] kalmah2112: Mop was amazing. Pandas were and are still a joke of a race, but the expac was great otherwise
[2:47:46] tydr1m: wotlk > mop
[2:47:46] eynix: yea this is why i can't get on board with retail
[2:47:47] sgviolentclaps: wait did he die????
[2:47:47] HOWTF: soundin like an elitist jerk over there OMEGALUL
[2:47:49] Mapthesoul: If you were to start at the most recent expansion would you need to buy the previous ones aswell or just the most recent one?
[2:47:50] surpriseparty20: Blood sweat and tears LUL
[2:47:50] Ryuko198: @Ryuko198 its mostly cause i was pvp guy.... I LOVED pvp in mop
[2:47:52] bloodborne60fpsplz: Now we have transgender evoker lol
[2:47:52] THE_LOCKERROOM: For the hord
[2:47:56] Kbreeze: gayge

[2:47:57] CabraBOOM: :( same
[2:48:00] shaggy462: yeah it was so wierd for me at the time
[2:48:00] KidRainbow: mop was actually quite good
[2:48:01] D3STROI_: F Mists of Pandas
[2:48:04] shaggy462: i quit when too
[2:48:05] Kbreeze: KappaPride KappaPride KappaPride
[2:48:06] shaggy462: then
[2:48:06] lycen1: @shroud I was the exact same and did the same
[2:48:07] MKDarker: I can relate, cause I liked and played Wc3 Reign of Choas / Frozen Throne a lot
[2:48:08] skulldrip: MoP was dark af at the end
[2:48:09] BlastedNips: It was the same for a lot of people. That was when the lore started really going downhill for me.
[2:48:12] blurTTV: i love mop because i love panda express
[2:48:15] RedSniper6: i just didnt care to see a joke from the warcraft game as an exspansion
[2:48:15] gerkins860: skipped it too
[2:48:17] ShawnLIVE: not that good
[2:48:17] akajry: i missed MoP and WoD
[2:48:18] TalesOfRome: I did the same exact thing
[2:48:18] cheesed_bucktee: dk quest is slaughtering a village XD
[2:48:19] GeorgiTtv: that's a bad angle
[2:48:23] Buhbs_: mop classic?
[2:48:24] kurrce: mist was beautiful
[2:48:25] shaneshane: MoP was the last good addon

[2:48:30] Sheepfu: I liked MoP alot
[2:48:32] mata_03: pvp was good in mop
[2:48:32] BlastedNips: @shroud It'd be like if they added nekos to Starcraft. Just felt totally out of place.
[2:48:34] harleyirish: Pandaria is similar to Japan loved mop
[2:48:34] TalesOfRome: I really loved Legion but it was also the expack I had the most time to play
[2:48:34] Django_7: my personal favorite is legion i ve played non stop for 2 years
[2:48:35] surpriseparty20: Pandaria brought one of the most fun clases
[2:48:38] tydr1m: flabbergasted by lore
[2:48:41] Zenjaro: Mop was such a vibe. Reminds me of blood and wine from witcher.
[2:48:41] gerkins860: MOP is like that jar jar binks star wars period
[2:48:43] skulldrip: MoP Warlock Kreygasm
[2:48:48] aralin_mandolin: i feel like this is exactly how orcs would talk LUL
[2:48:49] dejavupro: What is your objective in hardcore classic? I do not find any motivation. It feels like just farming quests but more cautious.
[2:48:49] HalfaXan: i started with mop it will always be in my heart but there were better expensions
[2:48:52] Rapapep: This voiceover is pretty decent
[2:48:56] winskue: panda already lost the plot a little imo... wotlk best expansion

[2:51:02] RoyalState: Shroud , why is everyone hating on Druid i think it's one of the best classes it has both mage and melee and for end game it seems to be very good
[2:51:07] Kroovius: Horde guild?
[2:51:12] Atomikus88: Skullcrusher?
[2:51:18] drewthedude8: death and taxes
[2:51:21] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[2:51:28] end0rphyn: official HC soon? actual blizz servers?
[2:51:34] HalfTrack_: @dejavupro well technically it comes ahead of BFA and shadowlands, and probably WOD and legion. But I was embarrassed to list bfa and sl at all
[2:51:36] FuzzyYOLoo: shroudYikes
[2:51:43] manny_geee: Gentlemen’s Club

[2:52:03] dejavupro: @HalfTrack_ I agree with your last part but saying TBC is the worst kinda breaks my heart!!
[2:52:04] Alaziara: @Alaziara Sort of KEKW It's pretty bad atm though
[2:52:04] BlastedNips: I feel like I'm the only WoW player who gets to where they need to start raiding and quits. People say that's where the 'fun' is but the competitive aspect of it just turns me off.
[2:52:05] HalfTrack_: @dejavupro and I didn’t play wod or legion so I can’t speak to em.
[2:52:10] Sheepfu: Blue Garter?
[2:52:12] ItsGary: Problem with Druid in wow classic is that you are average at everything. Better chocies to bring for every role
[2:52:15] Peezo425: what server was it?
[2:52:19] dejavupro: @HalfTrack_ legion was great in my opinion
[2:52:19] end0rphyn: @LancelotTheLion @SgtOddity @Dox023 noice that's exciting

[2:52:25] Superherbie: what server is this
[2:52:25] DiscoBaller: @mielupwnz RestedXP Guides, first 1-22 lvls are free then the rest is one time pay for all
[2:52:29] felipep039: whats you favorite class?
[2:52:29] Shancii: do you think they will release classic cata/mop etc?
[2:52:32] Kroovius: They were like a top tier guild
[2:52:43] RoyalState: i meant the druid in diablo 4 haha @ItsGary

[2:54:25] Bon_Kley: they give a fuk but its hard and takes time to do good work
[2:54:26] ItsGary: Saying that im going Druid as well.  Regardless of how it plays il be Werebear/werewolf

[2:59:05] harleyirish: The resists are real on elites especially the spider boys
[2:59:05] akajry: @ItsGary I think it's about your interest in games. I'm 30 and still play games so I'm still interested in watching cool people play them. If I lost my interest in age I'd stop watching streamers too
[2:59:07] deadvesu: usually like 2 hits from the void is good enough sometimes more

[3:58:42] hazzas55: look up power hour UI on youtube and see if you like it. Had it in classic back in the day, already set up. @shroud
[3:58:50] xhairbait: Just give your community in discord a list of specs you want to experience

[3:59:01] Youredoneson666: you only need shit like that when you get some super CRAZY mods

[3:59:53] CardiacCat: Logical modded EFT onto my espresso machine
[3:59:57] xhairbait: I'm 100% unsure why the hell people don't use github for setting up keybinds, mods, etc... it's mindblowingly easy
[4:00:02] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[4:00:03] Notsolegendary: Doing it locally first is best, then tweaking it on the customer PC for final tweaks and unforseen issues. @shroud

[4:01:14] shiningbr8ght: shroud you don't need to mod games just play it we would watch
[4:01:16] disflux: @shroud  - Really they should be automating it. Scripting the entire provisioning process, given your hours and the sometimes quick turnaround periods, you don't want somebody needing to take manual steps for setup.
[4:01:25] LogicalSolutions: @shroud seriously would be down to help. i'm on PC 16-20 hours a day. work from hme. im PST as well

[5:31:46] RepoManOG: Pretty soon on Kick, they'll have Hardcore WoW where when you die in game, you die IRL, will be LIT Kappa
[5:31:58] saluu95: dang so the drops you get are perm thats harsh
[5:31:58] Stanlec: not until you are 60
[5:32:00] imthewumpus: I hope the rules stay the same, which they said they will
[5:32:01] ZHSpar1an: just remove exp from dunguons and increase dungueons quests exp
[5:32:08] imthewumpus: doing dungeons more than once isnt hardcore.
[5:32:13] saluu95: wow thats harsh
[5:32:17] Stanlec: cant farm dungeons back to back until 60
[5:32:35] saluu95: so now you region quest and onto the next dungeon?

[5:33:24] scootypuffjr42o: no ah no trades
[5:33:25] saluu95: level 25-35
[5:33:29] Squee311: when you get closer to 40 are you guys going to split hairs over the mail drops since he gets plate and you cna go mail?
[5:33:33] woodsycka: hop not
[5:33:34] saluu95: the one that looks like a fan
[5:33:34] james__mo: daily lockout would be dope
[5:33:36] imthewumpus: why is it lame?
[5:33:40] Skubo11: ssf is very good
[5:33:40] studshift: DAILY COOLDOWN for ea DUNGEON
[5:33:41] pibo123: cap it once per lvl
[5:33:43] saluu95: man i love dungeons dude...cant do that to me
[5:33:45] imthewumpus: if the players have one life why wouldnt the bosses?
[5:33:45] AwFeel: wait until you can free range AH and just buy gear and sit in dungeons all day and never have to quest outside zzzzzz
[5:33:46] KontrolStyle: he wants to spam dungeons duh LUL
[5:33:49] Teeko123: Teeko123 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:33:49] saluu95: imagine not farming SM that was so much fun
[5:33:49] Fox56: MMO about the grind imagine not being able to grind.
[5:33:51] phreshh: You'll get a bunch of boosters for SM and shit if you dont put a cap on the dungeons
[5:33:51] notColt45: Everyone will be in dungeons
[5:33:51] Bazooko1: 1 dungeon ID per day would be cool on official HC
[5:33:52] Gift_o7: make dungeons a weekly thing but turn off xp after the first run that week sounds cool
[5:33:52] Foxbounty: Yeah just have it refresh
[5:33:54] woodsycka: at 60 you cant get you bis
[5:33:57] aimdawg: true
[5:33:59] DeLaRambo: agreed
[5:33:59] SorryImTooL8: F
[5:34:00] matching_towels: Gives you more stuff to do too
[5:34:02] Wkdlzrchkn: yeah kinda worried the official HC is gonna be scuffed. Just dung spamming and bots gold selling all over.
[5:34:05] SolioCA: i think a time is a goood idea. every 24hrs or something
[5:34:06] deadvesu: thats what maeks HC fun though , you cant be mega over geared
[5:34:07] buttercps: u cant do the dungeons at 60?
[5:34:08] D3STROI_: 1 Dungeon is lame af
[5:34:09] saluu95: yeah boosting is really sad
[5:34:12] imthewumpus: makes it way to easy to just farm items when its supposed to be hardcore
[5:34:12] itskoosh: doing dungeons is more dangerous than open world. i dont get why it should be limited
[5:34:14] j0rdanx387: having all the best gear from farming dungeons would make lvling alot easier
[5:34:16] CritzBTW: what if they make it where you only get xp on your first run for HC official @shroud
[5:34:23] HalfTrack_: Yah dungeons should be farmable for loot. Maybe just disable do after first lockout recorded to prevent dungeon boosting.
[5:34:24] jessielight: Do you win at 60?
[5:34:24] CasualTryhrd: 5 dungeon lockouts per meets a good middle ground to combat boosting and just staying in dungeons imo
[5:34:28] DeLaRambo: more chances to die and fuck up the HC run anyway if you repeat the dungeons
[5:34:28] saluu95: lol win
[5:34:28] Miepprimal: 4 strength 4 stam leather belt
[5:34:34] blaise_pmk: You have a voice of a dude that drink too much coffee
[5:34:35] Ez_Fn_Pz: @missdollyllama no
[5:34:38] saluu95: there is no winning only the journey
[5:34:38] Allecrasto: is mount prohibited ? havent seen anyone with one.
[5:34:39] DeLaRambo: would be great
[5:34:41] Iam_StoneK: People are free to run this HC mode in the HC servers
[5:34:44] noobino: Got a new chair?
[5:34:48] jessielight: Ty
[5:34:50] saluu95: yeah cause then you can farm the good gear
[5:34:51] Nickzorz91: @Allecrasto No, just harder to get gold for it w/o AH
[5:34:53] contra_____: The truth is Blizzard will likely not listen to very much input
[5:34:59] AwFeel: just make the dungeons a daily, youd maybe run them 2-3 times before you outleveled them tbh
[5:35:00] Bobaloohoo: @blaise_pmk What does that even mean? LUL
[5:35:03] Allecrasto: @Allecrasto ahh noted
[5:35:04] Bazooko1: doubt blizzard will do any additional rules
[5:35:04] ovodeadbody: Is wow free?
[5:35:05] imthewumpus: farming dungeons for items just isnt hardcore...
[5:35:09] saluu95: lol mount farming is now really hard
[5:35:14] woodsycka: yeah should just have a check button for ssf
[5:35:15] saluu95: is it still 100g for a mount?
[5:35:15] vortexnob: it ramps at 38
[5:35:16] KontrolStyle: unless you grind for gold.. not likely
[5:35:18] lilearthh: Gold from qs ramp up
[5:35:19] shocketh: prob get mount at 44
[5:35:19] Foxbounty: @ovodeadbody To like lvl 20 yeah
[5:35:19] phreshh: Thats why you play pally or lock
[5:35:20] chancerofl: it ramps hard after 36
[5:35:20] carbonzo_bean: @ovodeadbody nope.  monthly sub
[5:35:21] Wellfarewarrior: Duel for gold
[5:35:26] HotCioffi: Mounts in HC is usually 43-45... after 40, the drops and quests give a lot more $$
[5:35:31] blaise_pmk: @blaise_pmk yeah maybe time for me to go to bed
[5:35:32] Raoul1337: it does rampu p pretty well late 30s
[5:35:37] Gift_o7: weekly reset for dungeons for like gear and stuff sounds cool
[5:35:38] ovodeadbody: @carbonzo_bean how much is that?
[5:35:38] saluu95: wait you can duel since you dont die in duels
[5:35:42] saluu95: right?

[5:36:19] Outstand0: come to Turtle where tauren have Plainsrunning :)
[5:36:20] Nickzorz91: @saluu95 Yep
[5:36:25] Iam_StoneK: Blizz wont add any rule. they will let the community play as they want. If you want to run the HC mod you can. If you want ti run dungeons all day and use AH you can. Its up to the player
[5:36:26] KontrolStyle: !hcaddons @blaise_pmk
[5:36:26] Fossabot: @blaise_pmk, here's a list of his WoW Classic Hardcore Add-ons - https://imgur.com/a/o6zqr43
[5:36:28] brainsmoov: so is duos easy mode
[5:36:29] CdnGrimReaper: i like asmons take. with drop the exp from mobs by 90% but make quest exp like 300% more so you get a big dump from the completing the quest once but then you dont have a real incentive to grind the dungeon except for maybe a couple pieces of gear
[5:36:32] Raoul1337: @saluu95 theres a funny death clip of someone dueling and getting to 1 hp on a fire and dying LUL
[5:36:33] Ez_Fn_Pz: i love the CX button
[5:36:36] stntmnmk: what professions do you both have @shroud
[5:36:37] KontrolStyle: @blaise_pmk, wrong person of course OMEGALUL

[5:37:12] KontrolStyle: if friends, play solo EZ @xxdockingdavexx
[5:37:13] saluu95: imagine a raid dude...
[5:37:15] saluu95: fuuuck
[5:37:21] Tho66: @setheauspleroma bro
[5:37:29] blaise_pmk: @xxdockingdavexx you can easily make friends in game bro, HC is great for that
[5:37:37] setheauspleroma: LOL no dont do it. so easy to wipe
[5:37:39] Tupacwitha2pac: @Tupacwitha2pac thank ye
[5:37:40] Jarmiyo: !sens
[5:37:41] Fossabot: @Jarmiyo, Looking for his sensitivity for a specific game? Type the game name and sens - like !valorantsens or !apexsens
[5:37:45] w1ddershins455: !sens
[5:37:48] saluu95: yeah i feel like hardcore is the purest form of what wow used to be
[5:37:53] Jarmiyo: !valorantsens
[5:37:54] Fossabot: @Jarmiyo Valorant: Sens: 0.8/Scoped 1 | DPI: 400 - Windows: 6/11 - Raw-Input: On - 1000 Hz Polling Rate
[5:37:55] saluu95: not all this boosted BIS gear bs
[5:37:57] glocksaintlsshin: !macro
[5:38:05] Nickzorz91: @xxdockingdavexx Theres a channel in the HC discord for people looking for duos you can probably find someone there with a similar schedule
[5:38:08] ArchiArchi: wait, isn't that Chad's voice? :D
[5:38:16] saluu95: sell in org auto chat trade chat
[5:38:19] saluu95: ezpz
[5:38:21] Protomateria: no, its ska @archiarchi
[5:38:30] slinky061: play some cs
[5:38:47] LevantineCS: it feels like an old school rpg
[5:38:48] xxdockingdavexx: @xxdockingdavexx hey thanks
[5:38:51] saluu95: yeah dude dungeon running is the best part man
[5:38:52] way_back: agreed
[5:39:01] AwFeel: Daily dungeon cooldowns please Blizz
[5:39:02] blaise_pmk: worlds buffs make it less pure
[5:39:07] DPTDave: makes the dungeons higher stakes though. dungeon spam is whack
[5:39:08] Raoul1337: the one dungeon rule was literally implemented because of dungeon spamming yea
[5:39:10] setheauspleroma: i agree
[5:39:14] saluu95: is there pvp in this mode? like BGs?
[5:39:28] brainsmoov: if they dont lock trading, then its stupid
[5:39:29] way_back: If people want to cheat that doesnt take away your enjoyment imo
[5:39:32] igorra_: Blizz can just make certain items nontradable
[5:39:32] imthewumpus: so then streamers will just get stuff traded to them asmon style?
[5:39:33] joshjarx: Did you expect Liquid to get WF over Echo finally?
[5:39:34] igorra_: like gold and pots
[5:39:35] Nickzorz91: It would be cool if they disabled AH and trading for hc official
[5:39:35] Youredoneson666: That's a lot of assuming. maybe they'll put rules to where you can't do that
[5:39:36] woodsycka: Lock trade to lvl 60 only
[5:39:37] asleepnotwoke: So you can already get around the addon right now with that is the thing
[5:39:44] igfuryturtle: !mic
[5:39:44] Fossabot: @igfuryturtle Mike uses the Blue Mouse microphone amzn.com/dp/B000RLF7KA
[5:39:45] asleepnotwoke: so just open it up on official imo
[5:39:47] igfuryturtle: !headset
[5:39:47] Fossabot: @igfuryturtle He uses the Logitech Pro X Wireless Lightspeed Gaming Headset, shroud Edition | https://load.gg/Logitech-Shroud (he uses default stereo settings)
[5:39:47] murk__lurk: they should have a lvl range for trading
[5:39:50] imthewumpus: @Nickzorz91 ya they should 1000%
[5:39:51] HotChocolate_: Won't be like thar when fresh but eventually yeah
[5:39:51] I_Devious_I: boosters wouldn't be a thing with the level limitations, no reason to have a limit on how many times you can do a dungeon
[5:39:52] Miepprimal: Are there so many nonhc's on this server?
[5:39:56] saluu95: thousand needles is bad for falling off the Fucking lift
[5:39:56] ZHSpar1an: I just use addon to see death
[5:40:02] mashdapotato: if they allow trading, whats the point of hardcore. You literally juse explained why trading would be bad lol
[5:40:03] wakaflakaseagulls: How would boosters get shit on their hc though
[5:40:07] AwFeel: conjurable trading only until 60 ???
[5:40:07] ManicMice: yeah its still blizz after all
[5:40:08] Wkdlzrchkn: I hope they make it so you cant release and the only option is to log out lol
[5:40:09] Squee311: i likea 3 day dung cd for al lthe pre 60 dung
[5:40:12] SpaceVoyage: it would be sick if they made it on character creation u pick rulesets and it just gives u a title/achievement and locks those features
[5:40:12] blaise_pmk: lock AH till 60 as well
[5:40:16] KontrolStyle: @Miepprimal seen a few
[5:40:19] joshjarx: im a retail andy but the part of classic i love is the leveling experience. retail is all about rushing to end game
[5:40:20] Timskey: Unlikely, whatever the easier form of development they can take they will take
[5:40:20] rodd6y: !pc

[5:40:21] imthewumpus: no trading is a huge aspect of what makes it hardcore...
[5:40:22] Lovin_Machine: have you seen the rules for turtle wow HC?
[5:40:32] Ez_Fn_Pz: @Chewythechip Hardcore is about dying, Solo Self Found or Ironman is about not trading.
[5:40:39] AwFeel: yes
[5:40:40] Bunz_NZ: What level is Tyler?
[5:40:41] brainsmoov: why wouldn't they? explain
[5:40:45] Stanlec: lock it to 60 EZ Clap
[5:40:45] Bruise_xd: if they dont their servers are doa
[5:40:50] imthewumpus: yeah I do they said they are keeping rules same didnt they?
[5:40:57] Ez_Fn_Pz: You need a SSFHC and a normal HC
[5:40:58] mothilium: we have the addon now, we might have an addon in the official server to help regulate things as well @shroud
[5:41:00] brainsmoov: what value does blizzard get out of the AH?
[5:41:09] Timskey: That sounds good for the server health if thats any caveat
[5:41:14] hashtagyolo11: no AH would be good, professions should be able to interact with each other, vanilla was designed around it
[5:41:16] flowmotion_x: blizzard is creating this with minimal changes, they will not sink development time into HC servers outside of really death being permanent
[5:41:16] CHE5US: whats the quest helper addon you are rocking on the left?
[5:41:19] TheYellaKing: hi shroud
[5:41:21] AwFeel: maybe have trading but no AH ??
[5:41:21] Squee311: in the interview they said it will bea bit more like wow but they will have some rules so most of what shroud is saying is prolly right
[5:41:29] Raoul1337: it will just be death+delete, i dont think theres gonna be any restrictions
[5:41:37] Squee311: ptr is soon tho so we will see their plans
[5:41:39] KK_RONALDO: !addons
[5:41:39] Magris: trading and AH allow for gold buying. u dont want it
[5:41:39] Fossabot: @userdie_e Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[5:41:49] scootypuffjr42o: ah and trades at 60 only
[5:41:50] matching_towels: If you die you turn into a ghost apparently
[5:41:52] Skoemmy: Make it so you can only trade items once and only a lvl differance of 10 lvls
[5:41:53] brainsmoov: locking trading/ah till 60 is the smart move
[5:41:55] Lovin_Machine: trading within 5 levels
[5:41:57] asleepnotwoke: they wont
[5:41:59] Timskey: We will have to see but I really hope blizz doesnt drop the ball on the HC mode. Do it right
[5:42:03] scootypuffjr42o: gonna be so many bots and gold farnmers
[5:42:04] nourada69: finding a BOE will mean something again
[5:42:05] Ez_Fn_Pz: if they are smart they copy OSRS and Path of Exile.
[5:42:05] AwFeel: @Lovin_Machine oh i like that tbh
[5:42:05] mashdapotato: blizzard messing up yet again lol they have the guidelines and the people who literally coded this and still will mess it up
[5:42:07] murk__lurk: Just do both with a limit on who you can trade/AH with  by lvl range
[5:42:07] Bazooko1: blizzard is always way too passive and uninnovative with this stuff
[5:42:09] Fepersz: lets gooo trading, AH, dungeons, all integral parts of this beautiful autistic game
[5:42:14] blaise_pmk: Some players only do craft/AH, they don't care about leveling/gearing
[5:42:15] clancylegit: if they do classic plus i want only one thing tauren rogue
[5:42:17] Skubo11: i will play with addon
[5:42:18] imthewumpus: it's only going to be good if they keep the rules 100% the same.
[5:42:18] mctinyy: Can you use the mail when you're dead? Be cool if you have to "pre" bank your stuff for alts
[5:42:18] asleepnotwoke: @scootypuffjr42o 1 life man, bots are dead more than alive
[5:42:21] cokedupbrah: And that is why this hardcore addon will still be THE MAIN FOCUS on the blizzard hardcore server!
[5:42:24] flowmotion_x: Blizzard does not care about the addon
[5:42:27] imthewumpus: it looks like hardcore
[5:42:27] Stanlec: gold sellers gonna be eating good if AH and trading is enabled PepeLaugh
[5:42:27] Magris: if they open trading and AH. Your gonna see everyone having their mounts the day they hit 40 and epic mounts at 60 and buying all the shit they want
[5:42:31] Raoul1337: i mean they pretty much confirmed that already in the announcement, they want it to be more "social" than it currently is which implies trtading
[5:42:32] clapncheex: This is derrived from speed runners right
[5:42:40] brainsmoov: so play non hc, what are u even saying lmao
[5:42:41] AwFeel: blizz deletes core feature of the game every expansion KEKW
[5:42:43] saluu95: i think asmon will hit 60
[5:42:47] Timskey: Exactly, they are not putting that much effort into a small project
[5:42:57] saluu95: i think dungeon cool downs should be a thing not one run only thats sad
[5:43:00] Gummybunnn: why make it "hardcore" if it isnt hardcore tho
[5:43:06] KeKnology: I feel like they might have a SSF checkbox when you create your toon
[5:43:10] saluu95: @Gummysharkk what would make it hardcore?
[5:43:13] ZoxileTV: From urn guild. Just died on my 26 shaman in the same mine I died in on my 22 Druid. DONT go in the venture co mine in stometalon
[5:43:13] imthewumpus: they arent developing the only consumers they should be thinking about are the current HC community
[5:43:17] ukel: isn't that kinda the point
[5:43:20] Timskey: but thats why the addon will always be better than the official servers
[5:43:20] deadvesu: I think they will try to implement as much of the hardcore rules / add on that we currently have
[5:43:24] Freon_R134: "hardcore" is not up to one group to define
[5:43:24] Unbound_Entity: good. fk em!
[5:43:26] RudyRube: @Gummysharkk hardcore just means if you die you are dead, all the rest of it is SSF features, not hardcore ones
[5:43:26] saluu95: this is like hardcore iron mans like in runescape
[5:43:28] kusshie420: !addons
[5:43:28] Fossabot: @420datkush420 Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[5:43:29] mashdapotato: Thats the point of hardcore lol its amazing that this is even a debate
[5:43:31] sayem5: what time does premier start/
[5:43:33] fukwhatyaheard: people playing hardcore though know what they are getting into.
[5:43:34] Poppa_Grande: i like theres more horde
[5:43:35] flowmotion_x: people are conflating Hardcore with SSF, these terms are adopted from ARPGs Hardcore doesn't mean giga hard rules it just means permadeath lmao
[5:43:41] Gummybunnn: @saluu95 if they are claiming no trading/AH is hardcore why wouldnt they disable it until 60?
[5:43:47] MasterGoofy: maybe if hc playrs had an xp buff or something more people would hit 60
[5:43:48] toes2: I thought the point was to complain on Reddit no matter what
[5:43:48] club420: put weekly lockouts on dungeons, youll out lvl them b4 the week is over anyways so farming wont be efficient going back after a week
[5:43:54] Protomateria: yeah SSF is just a modifier to HC
[5:43:58] QuanFu_: whole premier squad grinding ranked and shrouds grinding WoW OMEGALUL
[5:43:58] pallidio: TRUE
[5:44:01] AwFeel: "rulesets"
[5:44:08] KingQueenAce: ooooh nooo
[5:44:08] HotChocolate_: Ironman rules are even more hardcore than these rules
[5:44:11] RemoteDaniel: Just item caps in 10-level ranges?
[5:44:22] Freon_R134: so how will official HC deal with griefing?
[5:44:23] KontrolStyle: how boring LUL
[5:44:23] imthewumpus: that sounds boring
[5:44:31] Timskey: I feel like the re love for the game isnt 1 life though, its ALL of the elements of the addons hardcore
[5:44:33] Raoul1337: the rules are pretty much only in place because its a normal server
[5:44:39] ixpha: It being HC and seperated, i do believe they will be abit more gutsy tbh.
[5:44:40] cokedupbrah: The addon will still be the main focus on official hardcore blizzard server
[5:44:41] leevvzz: Is trading really that bad? It's msotly around the 1 life right
[5:44:43] mashdapotato: gonna be a lot of boostie "hardcore" characters
[5:44:43] Squee311: they wanta pvp aspect
[5:44:48] Freon_R134: griefing will ruin it then
[5:44:49] lycen1: if they add achievments and rewards for HC servers, i think alot of  people will play.  Get to 60 and get a mount or title etc
[5:44:53] Benjii111: griefers will be banned
[5:44:53] kall_torak: Lol sorry i struck a nerve with the mods, anyone expecting blizzard to do Iron Man rules is on copium
[5:44:56] shaikhwastakenwastaken: chat griefing is a game design  problem its a sht human problem
[5:44:57] nochillcollin: how come ive seen streamers do dungeons multiple times on hardcore i thought this wasnt allowed
[5:44:59] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[5:45:03] Poppa_Grande: i only hear of top streamers complaining of griefing
[5:45:05] shaikhwastakenwastaken: is not*
[5:45:05] Gradyolson1: it be just like Diablo 3 HC. can do everything the same. just dont die
[5:45:08] Magris: i dont see why blizzard couildnt just employ the appeal people to do the same shit they are doing now and appealing greifing and bug deaths
[5:45:12] igorra_: I would try hardcore if instead of perma it would be a massive exp penalty potentially even deleveling
[5:45:13] AxB_lol: What about making trading a guild rep unlock. That way the can't trade immediately, but will be accessible to the dedicated players?
[5:45:13] j0rdanx387: official HC is great for exposure but im loving the version we have now and have a feeling Official will be worse
[5:45:14] Wkdlzrchkn: Blizzard already made a statement that they will be banning griefers
[5:45:14] AwFeel: we have to have assumptions to propel conversations like these
[5:45:15] tonjeq: @nochillcollin You can d a dungeon once
[5:45:24] wassaah: I think the community will just play on the HC server with THEIR rules
[5:45:25] cokedupbrah: The addon will go to the hardcore server??
[5:45:25] snake_SC: @shroud you need to make a death counter list with what level your characters died at
[5:45:26] Freon_R134: I guess blizz won't pay employees to manage appeals for griefing deaths in hardcore
[5:45:26] 4gustaf: Eventually people will migrate over I would think
[5:45:26] Ez_Fn_Pz: You're overthinking it, they'll just copy other games and what they are doing with hardcore.
[5:45:36] Benjii111: i think like 95% of people will go to official tbh, people on official will still use the addon i'm thinking
[5:45:40] ukel: yeah theyd have to hire the whole addon team
[5:45:40] TLBacon: will this be the rip of addons?
[5:45:43] TheDeathbinder: ofc it's more work for them
[5:45:44] Kellorian: I actually think I will prefer the auction house
[5:45:45] xhairbait: Are you kidding me... they're 1 for 1'ing the addon. Why do the extra work LUL
[5:45:47] Youredoneson666: they might bring on the team of the addon makers
[5:45:56] dillyduss: just use the addon on the new server
[5:45:57] Xinergy: They 100% need to change the pvp flagging mechanic or there will be lvl 1 griefers on every interactable npc in a neutral town
[5:46:00] Django_7: nor most people want to, hardcore should mean hardcore, 1 life
[5:46:05] wassaah: the addonless community will just die if your assumptions are right
[5:46:06] unbroken55: @shroud do you think this game needs to be changed visually?
[5:46:10] NoMoreSadness: your chat is so clueless FailFish
[5:46:11] flowmotion_x: dude chat is braindead
[5:46:11] xhairbait: But the addon's done the work for them
[5:46:12] Timskey: Its a problem though when hitting 60 on the addon has more authenticity than the official servers
[5:46:14] ovodeadbody: If I’ve never played wow is it too hard to pick up and play at this point?
[5:46:15] Freon_R134: I think simplified rules makes most sense as you say, not force disable of AH/trade
[5:46:16] ixpha: @Ez_Fn_Pz not many MMORPGS to copy HC from tho
[5:46:27] Azurehax: In most games Hardcore means exactly that. One Life, just look at Diablo etc
[5:46:31] Benjii111: I mean tbh bro that's not hard to do lmao
[5:46:32] xhairbait: yeah true, a bit, productionizing it...
[5:46:35] brainsmoov: addon does it, but its not easy to do o.o
[5:46:37] Beoorc: i don't mind trade tbh
[5:46:46] Magris: seems like the development time has been going on for a while considering they guys said PTR soon and release this summer
[5:46:48] FRANTICjk: i think HC servers will fail, because as always with community made things, devs usually ruins this kind of stuff :X
[5:46:49] Django_7: SSF thing has nothing to do with HC content so im glad official servers are just HC with no appeals
[5:46:50] moonboi: I could see them doing it like Heroic dungeons now. Just letting you do them once a day
[5:46:52] HotChocolate_: they have restriction capabilities in place for most i think, trial accounts cant trade, mail, or use AH, and in og classic they did have that max dungeons per day
[5:46:58] nyypsycho: Some will just use the add on for ssf and some will trade.
[5:47:04] Atkastur: people who join you will probably have all quests
[5:47:06] xxdockingdavexx: boooo lol
[5:47:06] Timskey: You are right it will take time but thats why they should dev it the right way, not rushed
[5:47:07] skympii: what i hate is if they dont limit the dungeons runs people just gonna lvl through dungeons
[5:47:11] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[5:47:15] Benjii111: they'll probably have like a 3 day dungeon lockout, not sure how they're going to handle open world grouping
[5:47:16] woodsycka: its coming out this summer so its to be expected its simply wow with one life only
[5:47:17] Wkdlzrchkn: You are probably going to just have people using the addon on the new server and having guilds that adhere to the rules
[5:47:28] Magris: people dungeon farming makes the world look empty i dont like it
[5:47:42] n0njaa: solo self found is the reason hardcore is fun, without it there is no risk, even current duos and trios struggle to die
[5:47:44] woodsycka: I agree with you
[5:47:46] paraizord: alliance rogue!
[5:47:47] tonjeq: idk why people even like HC, extremely time gated and just makes you play slow
[5:47:48] paraizord: do it
[5:47:49] matching_towels: @ovodeadbody never too late. Hardcore is a hard place to learn tho. Wow retail would allow you to quickly try a range of classes, then you can try wow classic
[5:47:53] SpaceVoyage: the server should be normal but just add better backend for addons to utilize and track everything server side vs clientside
[5:47:56] BabyJoker: lvel?
[5:47:59] BabyJoker: level**
[5:48:05] Villie: daily
[5:48:09] ChawXD: @tonjeq You just described why people like it
[5:48:10] BabyJoker: whats his level chat?
[5:48:12] Skrub_Lord: Yeah, it will most likely just be a fresh vanilla server with 1 life.
[5:48:17] Del_QT: 1x each dungeon per day would be best
[5:48:20] woolzieonpc: @BabyJoker bottom left
[5:48:21] Fossabot: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[5:48:22] nabi543: @BabyJoker look under the cam
[5:48:22] Nielqua: do you have any idea how many devs are working on classic? @shroud
[5:48:25] HotChocolate_: @shroud do you remember that they added a instances per day cap per character in vanilla to combat mage farming? it was 30/day
[5:48:26] BabyJoker: ty
[5:48:27] double0kappa: @BabyJoker bottom left corner states his level :)
[5:48:29] KoalaTheAwesome: @shroud  bro its just saving id for 200 years its not difficult to do
[5:48:31] tonjeq: .delete npc
[5:48:34] woodsycka: PVP is the thing that needs to be controlled the most
[5:48:35] fauntt: nahh it makes it so people dont spam the most efficient one
[5:48:40] HalfTrack_: Unless you’re struggling at your levels it’s so easy to mob grind thousand needles and ungoro during leveling to make up lost xp
[5:48:42] Benjii111: they'll probably be some new achievement system for HC
[5:48:44] Django_7: Trade restrictions have nothing to do with hardcore i dont get how SSF concept is bundled in HC mode
[5:48:44] cokedupbrah: The addon will come to the hardcore server
[5:48:47] Timskey: I mean thats what it comes down to. If it requires work, they wont do it
[5:48:47] Phobed: Blocking trading and AH shouldnt be a thing, its an mmo lol just block trading below 60
[5:48:48] Weagle404: would be nice if they remove pvp flagging completely
[5:48:48] btbamfan3: thats for streamers
[5:48:52] ukel: you more of a horde main @shroud  ?
[5:48:52] the_kev_gaming: i mean they can prolly just permanently enable the no trading tick in options
[5:48:52] Wickedend: just make it so the instance ID never changes once you clear it it stays cleared
[5:48:53] xhairbait: honestly, wow dev's have more available functionality than the addon is allowed to use. I'm also assuming the devs already have that tracking data
[5:48:56] lumpl_tv: is there a class that over or underperforms in classic hardcore? @chat @shroud
[5:48:58] Squee311: they wont be blocking bgs either i dont think
[5:48:59] Neonbonkers: there's already a block trade function in menus. You act like youre a programmer and know the labor already
[5:48:59] Mauwii87: im sure people are going to be using the addon on the hc servers
[5:49:01] Shajaa: @shroud Okay but ALOT of the rules from the addon are there because not everyone on the server is HC
