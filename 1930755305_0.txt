[6:53:39] natezer0: with the changes to how long it takes to get shadowmourne, you can just make some normal icc pugs and get it on your own by ressing shards
[6:53:42] Pallyofhell: is max boosting a tank dh tho

[6:57:05] irevxngee: rogue is one of the best classes on this boss
[6:57:37] Dark_templar114: warrior is really good here too with just one cleave target

[6:59:20] vikgabs: u taught me pvp swifty i still have ur old vidoes in my playlist on youtube :D massive respect ...why dont u wear ur green headband anymore
[6:59:24] jaydooberty: Steak and Potatoes?
[6:59:28] Dark_templar114: 6.5% or 26 depends on what you use, reduces the chance for attacks to be dodges or parried
[6:59:55] JattixTV: I am so far behind on my Wotlk DK that no one wants me in any groups =(
[7:00:23] Dark_templar114: I cant be trusted to take my DK into togc, path of frost is so tempting there
[7:00:41] SilkeySmooth: Swifty will be buying all the arp gear they wont be
[7:00:49] Pallyofhell: i cant be trust with any waterwalking ability LUL
[7:01:24] Dark_templar114: @Pallyofhell I roll out of 25 in my core raid, see who is getting walked
[7:01:25] neurionlol: wrathful season was when i started watching ur videos

[7:01:54] pethops: the xp buff?
[7:02:13] Dark_templar114: 50% exp buff in wrath until ICC comes and maybe not even then
[7:03:03] Dark_templar114: ICC is the endgame raid of the expac, no reason to remove JJ even when it is out
[7:03:14] pethops: @Dark_templar114 is it fast fast to lvl?
[7:03:17] natezer0: They will probably keep JJ until end of icc imo

[7:04:37] zackpapotta26: best war US/EU
[7:04:38] Dark_templar114: also having the heirloom gear is a nice option, make it a 70% exp buff
[7:05:12] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store

[7:20:55] ragekill7: 214k is cap gold i guess
[7:20:55] Superhumanjesse: Outside of hosts taking large host cuts and people buying millions of gold on websites GDKP is a great system
[7:20:55] DeadBananaTV: Deaths Verdict went to our GM first and now Shadowmourne will too, Yes... We are using LC x)
[7:20:57] sarenix: isn't gold cap like a million? or you mean gold cap in gdkp?
[7:21:01] Breakingludd: gdkp  is  not a  thing in retail
[7:21:07] Vahri: gold cap on retail is a million

[7:21:46] Superhumanjesse: 214k
[7:21:49] Vahri: oh, no i said retail xD i didnt realize you were on wrath
[7:21:53] natezer0: loot councils are corrupted 8/10 times.. usually leader and friends get good stuff even if they are worse than others in the raid
[7:21:54] sarenix: oh i didn't know that
[7:22:01] ragekill7: yes 214k
[7:22:05] Superhumanjesse: Boe
[7:22:09] DeadBananaTV: Yeah but the fact that both went to the GM, didn't really like it tbh. Gonna change to another guiild without LC, actually gonna use GDKP :D
[7:22:13] imobious12321: true
[7:22:33] Vahri: Hows your HC character doing? =D
[7:22:37] tehwaterboy: my guild uses thatsmybis and pretty much has zero drama
[7:22:46] sarenix: and what do they do share the gold ? how much core people are for doing gdkp? is basically you get the raid done for you?

[7:27:26] barrosluco33: u dont have it
[7:27:26] DeadBananaTV: Can be fun to check :D
[7:27:45] Dark_templar114: if you have 3% from the talents you only need 165 hit, however going over that soft cap is still good for fury
[7:28:12] ragekill7: Hit Rating Caps Level 83 Level 82 Level 81 Level 80 Hit Percent Needed To Never Miss 8% 6% 5.5% 5% No Buffs 263 197 181 165 1/3  Precision 230 165 148 132 2/3  Precision 197 132 115 99 3/3  Precision 165 99 83 66 3/3  Precision &  Heroic Presence 132 66 50 33

[7:43:08] Dark_templar114: @johnswitchseven if your just looking to level its a great time, with joyus journey's being active giving a 50% exp buff, but as far as raid goes your a tad late, you can catch up, with the H+++ dungeons and ICC heroics to do you can get to a comparable raid gear amount, the hard part will be getting into a raid, and if your a warrior/death knight/ret paladin, fat chance
