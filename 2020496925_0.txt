[3:38:25] Alaquane: we had warcraft 4
[3:38:27] Alaquane: it was bfa
[3:38:52] Rilix: i think a warcraft RTS game is a good way to set up lore for multiple expansions
[3:38:55] TheGiant99: Do you think Rumble was as big a hit as blizz hoped for
[3:38:56] Alaquane: Veteran of the 4th war titles

[3:39:45] snake_like: nah, but maybe they'll do a remake of wa-- oh wait
[3:39:49] Molvonos: Blizz kinda set up the genres and the games associated with it.  Unless they make a new IP, Starcraft is their RTS genre.
[3:40:06] Molvonos: Or just Reforge the shit out of the old Warcraft RTS's, again.
[3:40:13] Kelticlore: I know it would take a bit to code but id like to see them take warcraft 1-3 and put it on same engine and sell it as a bundle
[3:40:13] Coresmoke420: yea warcraft 3 rts with the hero leveling is why they made world of warcraft
[3:40:26] Molvonos: @umax No.

[3:46:49] cruzeal: they could do it soon maybe like diablo immortal
[3:47:05] Rilix: meat wagons with the range increase are very helpful on a lot of the PVE heroics because they outrange towers and some bosses

[3:47:17] Ordogg: @Towelliee Why dont you have a cell phone?
[3:47:18] Gibsonex937: immortal went pc because of lots of backlash but immortal also makes them tons more money then rumble

[3:48:42] texasjoe1983: how much money you spend on this so far, or are you f2p?
[3:48:42] Rilix: a lot of the strats for the heroic missions can be completed by getting harpies to the boss and distract it just before with a rock elemental
[3:48:44] Coresmoke420: lol i had 2 person que to get to realm list
