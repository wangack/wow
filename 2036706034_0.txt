[1:31:30] ShaHugs: did monk 0-6?
[1:31:31] PastaSeat: I just don't get why people are so stingy with it. It's not rated 3v3, just press a button
[1:31:37] DirtyYankee0: 1-5 @ShaHugs
[1:31:43] Raikubest: blackout kick dead
[1:31:57] ShaHugs: he can’t 1-5 if it’s 3-3 healers
[1:31:59] DirtyYankee0: WW is lowkey massive
[1:32:01] admiraltegetthoff: Should blizz revert the crit change in pvp?
[1:32:17] snakefizz: i like seeing mages get shreked
[1:32:20] hrdstylerz: i think everything does too much damage
[1:32:28] DirtyYankee0: I think healer crits should be stronger
[1:32:30] omelletas: Nah it doesn't solve it
[1:32:35] Immortal1266: healer crits would just buff hpal i feel
[1:32:37] ShaHugs: what about 25% crit damage
[1:32:40] PastaSeat: They just need to tone down burst CDs further I think, bump sustained dmg more
[1:32:51] csmartypants: dewS
[1:32:52] zaim21: they need cheat death pvp trinket bonus :)
[1:32:52] Lydiayang: could you show ur healing breakdown overall
[1:32:55] zachgamegodx: that's too little variation
[1:32:55] symbolism369: Do u think u can heal and dps a 2s game and win
[1:32:58] omelletas: The classes need tuned again
[1:33:01] symbolism369: with both characters
[1:33:03] zachgamegodx: crits are important tbh
[1:33:07] Sosatko: To much bloat
[1:33:07] snakefizz: when pvptuning
[1:33:08] BetterknownasJohn: scaling happened
[1:33:08] Aro725: cooldowns happened
[1:33:09] Immortal1266: they wanted matches to be less than 3 minutes long
[1:33:09] DirtyYankee0: what happened is class reworks
[1:33:11] Sosatko: to many modifiers
[1:33:11] zachgamegodx: otherwise everything is scripted to bits
[1:33:17] symbolism369: i believe in u
[1:33:17] nikthevoker: they made everything around modifiers
[1:33:22] Jplague21: They took out resilience and there are too many modifiers
[1:33:23] Cybernytez: too much dam and less healing
[1:33:25] meatiusloaficus: people got better, so imbalances are magnified maybe.. i dunno
[1:33:25] papagoog: i think dev crit damage should also be standerdized, as they crit at 1.75 instead of 1.5
[1:33:31] ChumpSeason: i feel like they need to slow damage a tad but not speed up recovery from dmg somehow
[1:33:31] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:33:32] omelletas: 300k rsk is too much
[1:33:34] ShaHugs: the ilvl jump for this patch was bigger than the last 2 so massive stat inflation + main stat bonus from trinkets
[1:33:49] CitrusLump: i think just later in the expac players are much stronger with tier sets and such but defense doesnt rlly get any better
[1:34:48] ChumpSeason: @ShaHugs IL/Stat inflation between tiers has been an issue for years for sure

[2:01:14] Cybernytez: 30 sec is not meta conform anymore at all
[2:01:39] GnelGnelGnel: would 10sec forbearance be crazy?
[2:01:58] DirtyYankee0: 10 is too little imo
[2:02:11] pattarx: even 5 sec off forb would be noticeable
[2:02:22] DirtyYankee0: yeah 25 wouldnt be a bad choice
[2:02:26] Requiem237: it used to be like 5 min lol
[2:02:30] Cybernytez: i would make ist prob 15 or 20 sec idk
[2:02:31] pattarx: the problem is if you just delete forbearance you can chain together immunities
[2:02:39] pattarx: but i am a hpal main who has died many times while on forb
[2:03:02] Cybernytez: 30 sec is too long man
[2:03:04] PastaSeat: Forbearance should just be per paladin, or 20 seconds IMO
[2:03:05] Itankarenas: EZ double precog
[2:03:09] GnelGnelGnel: if forbearance was just per paladin but still 30 sec it wouldnt be all that impressive to chain immunities
[2:03:10] pattarx: per paladin might be ok

[2:17:42] Schnellmusic: Dude in PVE gear?  he has embellishment damage
[2:17:51] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Plate didn't seem to matter the 2nd or 3rd last round for the rogue
[2:18:08] Itankarenas: I wanna see how far top players can take a triple dps team tbh
[2:18:21] Qtpiextclolz: is kickbot petkick?
[2:18:23] omelletas: @atomic_gossipgirlxo smells fishy

[2:31:36] Itankarenas: easy 32 step opener
[2:31:52] DirtyYankee0: yeh arcane is complicated
[2:32:17] atomic_gossipgirlxo: @Itankarenas I wanted to try a frost mage until I put all the damage spells on my bars and thought "no thanks"
[2:32:26] Karaelolz: he was frozen
[2:32:36] Itankarenas: @atomic_gossipgirlxo i've been leveling as frost, was actually really easy

[2:34:27] FranklynEU: Interesting
[2:34:30] FranklynEU: very intersting
[2:34:33] DirtyYankee0: new dodge talent gives a random edge to WW vs rogue
[2:34:35] Itankarenas: best xpac in years is what most people say
[2:34:50] DirtyYankee0: dance of the wind
[2:34:52] aimbotmir: its instead of dampen right?
[2:34:57] skydog70: except cheap shots cant even be dodged right
[2:34:57] DirtyYankee0: i am assuming
[2:35:01] Schnellmusic: can't dodge in kidney
[2:35:02] pisspuke: lmao calling mvq a shuffle dh is so funny xD
[2:35:06] skydog70: i seen kidney and rakes and bashes get dodged
[2:35:07] zachgamegodx: oh it works
[2:35:08] DirtyYankee0: damn
[2:35:19] Fixit_cat: Rekt
[2:35:20] zachgamegodx: chun plays it

[2:35:38] Itankarenas: that's so RNG
[2:35:40] zachgamegodx: it’s pretty good if you’re not getting focused at all
[2:35:41] swolegreekgod: I love the spicyness
[2:35:51] tefl0ntom: over dampen? hard pass
[2:35:52] Moobot: Latest YT Video: Cdew's Guide to Restoration Druid PVP | Dragonflight 10.2 - youtu.be/EPyCHutkldQ
[2:35:52] ShaHugs: is dampen the fake cd or diffuse?
[2:35:55] Karaelolz: ye what if you dodge an auto attacl
[2:35:58] Solastro: pretty trash, gets removed with a single melee hit
[2:35:59] Karaelolz: that's garbage
[2:36:00] Itankarenas: yeah, literally only vs melee cleave I think
[2:36:05] Itankarenas: and even then it's so RNG
[2:36:06] FranklynEU: Is it only me that really hates these talent trees? honestly one of the reasons I stopped playing retail
[2:36:09] Solastro: its just 10% increased dodge
[2:36:12] zachgamegodx: it’s not rly for rogues
[2:36:18] zachgamegodx: it’s for big hit class
[2:36:25] bubblebuddyx_: i dont think ive ever killed a ww that pre damped at full hp
[2:36:30] DirtyYankee0: thats just you @FranklynEU
[2:36:34] Itankarenas: @FranklynEU these talent trees are great. really close to old trees, but lots of choice

[2:36:47] knucklesthedruid: in a way isnt that at least 10% less damage taken vs melee? Over a large sample size
[2:36:51] jherm42: jherm42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! yo
[2:36:55] knucklesthedruid: or am I thinking of it wrong?
[2:37:07] DirtyYankee0: I saw chun running that dodge and he dodged leg sweep @cdewx
[2:37:23] FranklynEU: @Itankarenas as daft as it sounds imo they gave us way too much choice, when I was speccing my UH DK it felt so bad to just leave so many good talents out
[2:37:26] Solastro: pretty tragic that the monk tree is so badly designed that they dont get to use any of the capstone talents
[2:37:33] Itankarenas: the problem is, -10% dmg taken isn't the same as dampen when u need it
[2:37:35] FranklynEU: Maybe I just needed time to adjust
[2:37:37] zachgamegodx: @knucklesthedruid should be better
[2:37:42] DirtyYankee0: yeah that shit is trash @Solastro
[2:37:56] Lydiayang: lmao imma try that on fistweaver
[2:37:56] Karaelolz: @knucklesthedruid realistically it will be less than that because monk will get stunned and shit and you can't dodge then
[2:37:57] kheilas: it stacks up to 90%, resets, and starting ramping up again
[2:37:57] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[2:37:59] Itankarenas: 20-50%
[2:38:17] Solastro: @kheilas gets removed by literally any melee swing tho, including pet attacks
[2:38:25] knucklesthedruid: @Karaelolz but at the same time if your not attacked it goes up to 90%
[2:38:39] Itankarenas: 0 crit build EZ
[2:38:40] knucklesthedruid: @Karaelolz so a rogue woulkd have to backstab you first?
[2:38:49] Karaelolz: @knucklesthedruid true
[2:39:02] DirtyYankee0: I am not sure which abilities can dodge and which cannot
[2:39:06] Solastro: if it was only 10% dodge on abilities and not white swings
[2:39:12] FranklynEU: Hows like been treating you anyway Chuck, not been here in a while. Wife and kids good?
[2:39:16] Itankarenas: dance is like maybe good for shuffle, and even then it can't be better than dampen
[2:39:29] FranklynEU: life*
