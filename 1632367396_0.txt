[0:51:46] yudai95: what gearsore do they have??
[0:51:50] frosthorne: Info still doesn’t explain why it’s called undying though. It’s just a naxx race with under geared chars

[1:22:56] hustlahh: it means bis
[1:22:59] SpiderblueTV: can they line up the 3rd locks gear please, my OCD is getting triggered
[1:23:02] itsbananas01: Most, if not all DoTs, do not update their damage dynamically; their damage is computed ONCE when cast
[1:23:05] CrixVibez: So GX has higher pieces in his bag.
[1:23:06] Svenssonx: Yeah they don't
[1:23:07] LuiBMHunter: ilvl different on amulet
[1:23:09] notsoAbusive: it's bugged or taking into account stuff in his bags

[1:23:29] Amnesis_NL: @Amnesis_NL should be equipped... gives wrong impression
[1:23:31] HAV0C79: prob like in retail, takes the highest ilvl for every slot in bag or worn
[1:23:41] Cosmophile: @CrixVibez DOING GREAT BROTHERRR

[1:25:32] ConcernedGaming: So if someone dies, can they reset the raid?
[1:25:41] SpiderblueTV: scuffed timers!
[1:25:42] Beastylol: what guilds are those ?
[1:25:43] FamLeeGaming: Can we take those overlays off or shrink them holy crapola
[1:25:49] Tastyblue: geega
[1:25:49] bennay1: It's +30 seconds
[1:25:54] slimjimothy_tv: @AsaPhelps we 1 healed 10 man on week 1, it's not bad
[1:26:02] hustlahh: supaida uingu
[1:26:06] borahwow: enhance on top

[1:26:15] 2woDads: SF dps higher
[1:26:15] honey_sipdhit: dont shrink overlay, this UI looks like good ol' wotlk UIs actually did
[1:26:23] everlastingsummerw: progress killed the boss in 1:10 exactly , spaceforce in 1:09
[1:26:34] everlastingsummerw: can't believe how close their dps is
[1:26:39] insso: why are the times different
[1:26:39] Fuwahta: timer Sadge
[1:26:50] faamil: Why are the timers wrong?
[1:26:51] Turntablist08: What are these UIs? Is it zoomed in? Where are the action bars?
[1:26:55] hustlahh: can they equip the loot they find
[1:26:58] TangledPeace: Timers are scuffed
[1:27:05] therickjames: what are these timers
[1:27:08] iBayouu: @hustlahh yes
[1:27:10] FamLeeGaming: @hustlahh Yes
[1:27:11] Syctris: @Turntablist08 observer view
[1:27:14] hustlahh: daddyus
[1:27:15] ConcernedGaming: @Turntablist08 Its a Spectator UI not a player UI
[1:27:17] Amnesis_NL: @TangledPeace they know were getting new ones soon
[1:27:25] FamLeeGaming: @therickjames Time the entered to prep nothing important atm
[1:27:30] Slashoom: glitchless the only way
[1:27:33] Turntablist08: oh gotcha. thanks.
[1:27:33] Rngmonster: @Turntablist08 It's a spectator UI
[1:27:33] everlastingsummerw: the person filming is a spectator flying around so it's not a player ( he's in the raid so he has acces to DPS meter and raid frames ) @Turntablist08
[1:27:38] SinzarForgiven: I had no idea Zirene was casting here! :O
[1:27:38] Wartface: Please casters; wait for someone to stop talking before starting - 2,3,4 of you talking at the same time is just white noise.
[1:27:42] SpiderblueTV: gigapull cause BE silence
[1:27:46] goldfishie1: what're the rules here? is it posted somewhere
[1:27:53] Lythrial: this poor lady is not being given a chance to pitch in...
[1:27:56] moderatygos: we do not have an official rule sheet
[1:27:58] TYK3E: Everyone speaking at the same time.. No commentary sync :P
[1:28:06] FamLeeGaming: @Wartface They need to have a "raise your hand" button to talk lol
[1:28:07] aleyn: @Wartface trueeee
[1:28:09] ModeraYsera: @Wartface they have a slight delay and cant always tell when someone else starts or stops, it isnt intentional
[1:28:09] iBayouu: AYAYA KERPY-CHAN, KERPY-CHAN, HES OUR MAN. IF HE CAN'T DO IT, NOBODY CAN AYAYA GO ADI GO AYAYA
[1:28:12] moderatygos: and the casters are not intentionally talking over each other, there tends to be some delay between them
[1:28:18] Tropus_15: why do they have 3 minutes differance in time?
[1:28:21] imtdoe: are they one healing?!
[1:28:25] ZUNKEN: 4 commentators are too many
[1:28:29] furanose: can we see boss hp jesus christ
[1:28:33] hustlahh: btw puged undying 1st week
[1:28:34] FamLeeGaming: @Tropus_15 Timers are not correct.
[1:28:36] sendhelp111: I love wow classic BatChest

[1:29:12] Crateria: zireneGUN crixgaSmile sarthe1Garthe
[1:29:14] FamLeeGaming: @Tropus_15 No thats not it. The timers are from when the guilds "entered" naxx nmot from whgen they started. They are working on fgixing it
[1:29:16] everlastingsummerw: the timers must be wrong there's no way , they started at the same time and they didn't wipe
[1:29:17] bestwarworld: mute blue haired girl
[1:29:19] meckinville: are these timers correct?
[1:29:26] akameap: @slimjimothy_tv at their restricted gear it abit rougher but yea you can
[1:29:28] ShiruShirudo: We are watching a speedrun, and the timer is incorrect. Should that not be fixed by ONE of the 4 comentators ?
[1:29:30] valaki8: did progress die or what?
[1:29:31] hasan666: Adidas?
[1:29:32] Crateria: peeppCheer
[1:29:37] FamLeeGaming: @meckinville No
[1:29:37] moderatygos: timers are correct
[1:29:40] honey_sipdhit: ban @bestwarworld
[1:29:47] moderatygos: every death adds time to the overall time
[1:29:51] MaJYNA: Can I see some gear score up in here?
[1:29:53] HammerVK: i remember this area :D
[1:29:58] SpiderblueTV: timers are NOT correct
[1:29:59] moderatygos: OK SORRY
[1:30:01] ShiruShirudo: there have been no deaths..
[1:30:06] everlastingsummerw: yeah but they didn't die , it's spider wing how could anyone die

[1:30:22] everlastingsummerw: no one died litteraly impossible it's spider wings
[1:30:23] moderatygos: i'll go to my corner of shame
[1:30:26] SpiderblueTV: they are like 10 minutes off
[1:30:36] pronkie2: why do they have different timers?
[1:30:44] aleyn: I think they should have 3 casters and maybe 1-2 for Break / Replacement because sometimes i feel like nobody finishes their sentence @Warcraft
[1:30:44] Aalee: The timers are based off when they zoned in right now, he said they would fix them.
[1:30:51] itsbananas01: VisLaud THE ROCKET BOOTS
[1:30:51] Luminous083: Timer started when they zoned in
[1:30:54] Slayergodx: tetsu does no dmg compared to tottoo?
[1:30:55] FamLeeGaming: Timers are from when the guilds entered the instnace not from the start of the race.
[1:31:18] SpiderblueTV: @Aalee blizzard also said they would fix wow
[1:31:19] wildboy789789: no mages? must be amature day
[1:31:21] moderatygos: admins are keepign official numbers
[1:31:33] moderatygos: they will attempt to fix on stream
[1:31:33] ShiruShirudo: can we see DPS rather than Damage done ? :(
[1:31:36] balmonic: that rog tho
[1:31:37] EdandJezi: I really love this idea, I hope we will see more races like this

[1:31:55] HammerVK: the shield thst drops i love the look :D
[1:32:03] notjuuju_: @PROTOFEESH Dps is on the right side next to the dmg done number
[1:32:04] Aalee: @ShiruShirudo you can see both haha
[1:32:05] LK_science: @PFJacobsen Based on when they entered the raid.
[1:32:06] AlphaGM: @ShiruShirudo it shows both. Dps is in ()
[1:32:14] KarroxShady: mods power tripping or what? the comments that are deleted are not even toxic
[1:32:16] SpiderblueTV: cause the timers are suffed @PFJacobsen
[1:32:18] N3llee: that mic quality is terrible
[1:32:18] FamLeeGaming: Hope the holy paladins get the shield lets goooooo
[1:32:25] Grimmawr: @FamLeeGaming i mean mages arent great with gear either tbh
[1:32:36] valaki8: so who is ahead now?
[1:32:36] masterkey_gaming: zzZzzZz
[1:32:42] slimjimothy_tv: can't you freeaction a web wrap
[1:32:45] SpiderblueTV: the entire meaning of this "speed run" and the timers are scuffed lol love it...
[1:32:45] Spotiex: Why dont they die? Maxx has posion? Thats a one shot!
[1:32:46] evnaf: web wrap = when the group gets wrapped up. holy moly no way
[1:32:51] Kilbridex: who is the blue haired girl?

[1:34:22] coldb333r: @suplexHS why are you watching then?
[1:34:25] FamLeeGaming: @suplexHS Not about the age of the game but the quality of the content. WoW Raiding is a step above and a game has yet to compete with it.
[1:34:37] darcyydoodle: please fix the timers its huge
[1:34:38] iBayouu: AYAYA GO ADI GO AYAYA

[1:35:50] coldb333r: @InNecoVeritas good one :)
[1:35:53] FamLeeGaming: @coldb333r Timers are from entry not from start of the race. The accurate timers are showing up at the bottom with boss kill times.
[1:36:01] Jovrix: why are they all such a low ilvl?
[1:36:14] FamLeeGaming: !gear
[1:36:14] Moobot: @FamLeeGaming Players start at 187 ilvl, honored with all reps, max engineering (no vendor or engi epics). They can only use what they acquire from dungeons, no quests. PvE gems and enchants are available.
[1:36:16] Kalia_NA: !gear
[1:36:33] TownPortaI: @Jovrix because the average item of their gear adds up to that.
[1:36:33] Wassah: lol
[1:36:38] issayata: Theyre not correct
[1:36:41] FamLeeGaming: @SpiderblueTV Not true they have already stated multiple times that they are nto correct.
[1:36:43] TownPortaI: @Jovrix sheesh
[1:36:46] itsbananas01: Bilzzard please nerf holy palaadins!
[1:36:49] drimus3000: AYAYA KERPY-CHAN, KERPY-CHAN, HES OUR MAN. IF HE CAN'T DO IT, NOBODY CAN AYAYA GO ADI GO AYAYA
[1:36:49] Jovrix: @TownPortaI -_-
[1:36:50] derpyous: They are not correct
[1:36:50] loeet: @SpiderblueTV They literally said at the start of the run that they are incorrect

[1:37:19] moderatygos: admins are keeping official time off stream
[1:37:25] slimjimothy_tv: i would've been rank one dk on noth if we didn't miss transition by 500 hp smile
[1:37:41] zerrouk71: @SpiderblueTV Timers are off dude
[1:37:44] slimjimothy_tv: don't miss the timer!
[1:37:45] FamLeeGaming: @SpiderblueTV They are using a addon that they have very little control over.  ITs proviced by WCLogs so no this is not true.
[1:37:57] the_bowuh: @omniscientautoma What is the logic behind the time not being correctly displayed on a time trial focused stream...
[1:38:00] CrixVibez: @SpiderblueTV bruh. The timers are off
[1:38:08] Toxiferous: 2s left to spare
[1:38:13] moderatygos: @omniscientautoma its almost like sometimes technical issues happen that are unexpected
[1:38:14] Esotraz: okay how did that message not go trough LUL
[1:38:14] CrixVibez: 3min 20 sec off
[1:38:34] coldb333r: @the_bowuh was wondering the same..
[1:38:38] itsbananas01: VisLaud Rogue with the BIG Crimson Tempest damage
[1:38:41] CritcobainTV: Looks good to me Keepo
[1:38:41] literalmountgod: blizz giving love to classic <3
[1:38:45] TensorTime: Safety Dance :)
[1:38:49] the_bowuh: Setting up a scene takes like 30 seconds
[1:38:49] HammerVK: oops it was a message asking for a Starcraft mmo sorry
[1:38:54] EdandJezi: I’m impressed with how quickly they are successfully moving through the trash
[1:39:04] RICOVERTHEDREAM: Did they had to start with a lower itemlvl?

[1:40:07] slimjimothy_tv: i doubt you want to AMS heigan, he claps with the aura
[1:40:09] Morfoick: Starcraft MMO wouldn't probably survive. Destiny 2 and Warframe already exist.

[1:44:49] honey_sipdhit: @Critcobain oh 50% left , but this is only the first wing?
[1:44:50] Xetane: why i keep hearing commentator talking about death when it is supposed to be an udying run?
[1:44:56] TrueNorthGameDev: I don't get how fixing the timers isn't a priority. This is brutal production.

[1:46:08] kellarXO: wasting spore buff lol
[1:46:10] L4mberk: guys, why where is no mage?
[1:46:10] itsbananas01: VisLaud DIFFERENT ROUTE
[1:46:16] slimjimothy_tv: he's completely correct pets are 50% of your damage and i have the logs to show it
[1:46:16] the_bowuh: at least the admins can see it on the time trial screen haha
[1:46:17] thechadlord: Idk about demo not benefitting. Ruin + Soul fire + lust execute is giga
[1:46:34] zannah81: sc were not 37 seconds quicker on heigan

[1:47:03] wrenched: moon2GIGA Pulls
[1:47:19] phendrana1: horde racials does favor horde boss kill time a bit

[1:47:42] Andersenofc: Spaceforce is ahead arent they?
[1:47:47] literalmountgod: nice strategy
[1:47:50] BigChoobs: boss kill timers are definitely off as well lol
[1:47:53] mooplol: nope
[1:47:54] PoggestofChampions: what do the 36m and 32m timers represent? time since the runs started?
[1:47:54] niightmare____: @Andersenofc no
[1:47:55] Andersenofc: If you look at the timer
[1:47:59] Telperio: Go on Crix, THEN TALK OVER HIM
[1:48:03] PopmycherryYO: @Andersenofc exactly. but be prepared to get comment deleted xD
[1:48:07] FamLeeGaming: @ella2k20 Timers are off. They started when the guilds entered the raid not when they started the race. Timers on bottom are time to kill boss and a little more accurate.
[1:48:09] Pikastews: mind control pull on razuvious is standard
[1:48:09] Elysianlight: unironically spaceforce on netflix was a fun show

[1:48:46] slimjimothy_tv: priests, i recommend glyph of mind control on raz in 25 man. makes it easy
[1:48:51] flammarofl: But did they start at the same time or did they have to wait 3 minutes or w/e
[1:48:54] niightmare____: you want them to die in speedrunning

[1:49:18] slimjimothy_tv: ya the disc is smiting right now. don't heal the adds here
[1:49:24] Kalia_NA: the times are wrong because the entered the instance at different times and waited for the race start to pull the first pack
[1:49:33] G0hard: full screen for patchwork?

[1:52:16] Subbed_No_Ban: raxxBorat
[1:52:18] slimjimothy_tv: just a skip thats all
[1:52:24] 2woDads: ppl like it
[1:52:27] Kalia_NA: @Lucky___Star it's a speedrun, skips like that are allowed
[1:52:28] X_ius: I mean it is a known thing blizz never has fixed and wont fix so i dont see it really as a exploit
[1:52:29] reshbet: Why delete that comment? It was the truth. Jumping thru that gate is an exploit.
[1:52:39] itsbananas01: LUL HPal is broken
[1:52:41] moderatygos: the rules probably outlined what was allowed and what was not, and that was allowed
[1:52:44] Cosmophile: Clearly not.

[1:52:47] Fennyyy: plea, di, mana pot xd
[1:52:51] Wolfaronie: Its awesome seeing 15k people watching this
[1:52:55] X_ius: its not like they are skipping mobs or glitching mobs to kill them easier etc its literally adding mobs to a boss fight to increase speed
[1:52:56] slimjimothy_tv: jumping into a gap is not an exploit lol
[1:53:13] knife_tv: if snapping wasnt an exploit in MDI then why would this be considered an exploit? literally the same thing
[1:53:15] subiettv: jumping through a hole isnt a exploit go back to retail
[1:53:16] Bubb4_J: @Nonbinary if it was an exploit it would have been addressed 18month ago
[1:53:19] Cosmophile: *bonk*

[1:54:26] Boinghot: Akshually haHAA  i've checked all the rules in the bible and THIS is an exploit haHAA
[1:54:29] reshbet: I got no problem with them using the gate exploiit. just call it what it is ,,,,

[1:54:37] Cosmophile: They disappear in 10m when Grobb dies. Not sure if it's a hotfix or 10m specific.
[1:54:50] Fennyyy: melee never run far enough out lol

[1:57:16] the_bowuh: DOn't understand why it took them 30 minutes but whatever i guess lmao.  Small indie company
[1:57:17] slimjimothy_tv: @welshSQUEE this event isn't for top raiders, it's for normies
