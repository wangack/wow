[5:27:24] ZetItUp: cloak is op
[5:27:25] minerman2: I just need them to chill with the mobility creep and instant spells.
[5:27:25] Drezzi_: dispersion does seem out of place in classic

[5:27:29] Xeogt: The less immunities, the better. Baseg
[5:27:31] RealitySuks: I don't mind not having cloak too bad I just wish they'd take shadow step off GCD
[5:27:33] ZetItUp: 85% cloak maybe monkaHmm
[5:27:37] thamysticog: cloak would make rogue OP #
[5:27:38] rethe283: how about we dont need cloak of shadows, but still get it?
[5:27:39] PinkSonicFan: cloak of shadows bad cause not fun to pvp other rogues?
[5:27:52] nurisher: as a Moonkin, if rogues get cos it's over
[5:27:56] teach96_tv: any chance you play hsrdcore again chief?
[5:27:58] ExhaustedPenguinz: i would like to remove fairy fire
[5:28:11] ZetItUp: it also makes alot of fights trivial with cloak
[5:28:17] Skiffin_: may be temp reflect?
[5:28:22] dodo_le_moineau: it's just lazy game design to add different abilities from other expensions
[5:28:23] thamysticog: like stoneform but for magic
[5:28:32] ExhaustedPenguinz: not immune 90% resist no?
[5:28:41] Drezzi_: maybe add something that pauses dot damage for 5 seconds
[5:28:42] xLuvz: or the thing like in retail when it absorb and dont unstealth you
[5:28:44] blakee199: reduced damage better I guess
[5:28:45] sailarkttv: paladins need avenging wrath
[5:28:45] Drezzi_: not remove
[5:28:47] celestius11: i hope they bring cloak later
[5:28:52] struci: a vanish for magic effects instead of roots YEP
[5:29:08] struci: like a 1s cloak
[5:29:08] NeoSpy: worst class rigth now in pve and pvp duel
[5:29:22] oakleafresin: PS DID U HAVE ADHD
[5:29:23] Skiffin_: spell reflect?
[5:29:29] nicktamere666: @NeoSpy try warrior
[5:29:41] Drezzi_: @oakleafresin the PS stands for 'prescribed stimulants'
[5:29:47] body_type_two: lets make rogue more broken YEP
[5:29:53] struci: not what I meant. something LIKE vanish but for magic effects instead of roots and slow
[5:30:01] struci: like a 1s cloak
[5:30:09] NeoSpy: @body_type_two rogue broken only against noobs, thats noob kill class

[5:30:50] NeoSpy: @body_type_two in duel rogue cannot win like anyone
[5:30:55] funnygoosecobra: pshero hides in the mountains near romania, and comes out at night to steal romanian sweet onions
[5:31:01] minerman2: Ps just opened on the only actual bear druid playing classic wow
[5:31:15] NeoSpy: @body_type_two example for you on streame
[5:31:51] nurisher: a nerfed cos version that just absorbs next incoming spell
[5:31:51] celestius11: i would actually be shocked if we didnt get cloak of shadows... seems so obvious to me
[5:31:59] ThyKingWizard95: that 14 slotter gonna be filled to the brim with vanish powder
[5:32:01] SchmittTV: something that gives a bubble could be cool so when you vanish it doesn't break right away
[5:32:01] boof_romancz: I think killing spree might come in
[5:32:05] Vetto_7: I would but it into belt instead of shadowstep

[5:34:09] Tehghost66512: its possible GM increased mob hp by 17 mil

[5:34:33] Wavy_Sinatra: i dont think gm healed it
[5:34:56] Frostlicious: We did it hours after the streamers went to bed. at 20% its a mechanic

[5:46:33] Qrucials: It's kind of up to rogues to make people take it seriously. If they start doing it and showing people how it can be good, more people will take it seriously
[5:46:33] rethe283: I think the problem is that the aoe threat sucks and most ppl dont want to take on tanking raids immediately, but are disappointed with the dungeons
