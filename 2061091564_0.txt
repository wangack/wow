[2:37:17] therealrickdiculous: just make everything BoE so you can sell it to everyone on the AH

[2:46:14] bearbot89: made fight so easy I range max range a los the charge
[2:46:21] SetDog1: this is why you have to check players gear score /s
[2:46:48] Shade2012: set up 2 different groups of 3. to exchange
[2:46:49] bearbot89: u don’t need to make groups u can los it so easy
[2:47:00] MysticalOS: also i think if fixed the bug where it's constantly nagging about dungeon mods in the raid, it's only supposed to do that if you are wiping to a boss you don't have mods for. but gnomer was misflagged as dungeon still.
[2:47:01] exnihilo777: there is a super secret cheese method too
[2:47:13] WhiskyThunder: sounds like bloodboil in TBC
[2:47:20] deywa7: @bearbot89 los it just before he casts it? like after hes selected a person?

[2:48:14] bearbot89: made fight easy
[2:48:17] MysticalOS: you don't need nature protection, just don't take 500% increased damage by doing mechanci right
[2:48:43] aoe_enjoyer: play raid music
[2:48:46] bearbot89: ur safe in middle of ramp
[2:48:52] exnihilo777: super secret cheese method uses only 1 guy on soaker duty
[2:50:08] fart_boiii: stay safe
[2:50:13] SetDog1: tell your raid your pulling now
[2:51:00] KaiserTex: there's nothing after
[2:51:11] aoe_enjoyer: its time
[2:51:22] StoneyYeti: this boss is weird
[2:51:35] MysticalOS: for good measure just put an infoframe on this boss that shows all players with debuff and time remaining. since most classic players don't run good unit frames
[2:51:38] StoneyYeti: you have to coordinate range groups good luck pugs
[2:51:53] bearbot89: @staysafetv if ur raid is struggling try tanking him with ur back to centre pillar and stacking

[2:55:41] StoneyYeti: last one is hard

[2:59:39] iBanEvader: can you still get the 1k rep from ashenvale weekly quest? @StaysafeTV
[2:59:39] fart_boiii: i hate wsg
[2:59:40] Fallacy_o7: it was scaling like to nothign with the quest
[2:59:40] HoustonSippers: its so bad that it only gives like 100 rep now

[2:59:49] SetDog1: ashenvale pvp is great for wsg rep, so much more reliable than the bg
[2:59:50] Curtsy: You usually have to actively look for people, everyone is doing other stuff
[2:59:53] therealrickdiculous: i think jokerd or someone said its only worth like 100 rep now instead of 1000

[3:01:54] ATcaribou: @KaiserTex jesus, its like the devs hear peoples plans and get mad that we have plans so they fuck us. even at 1000 it takes 21 weeks to get exalted from revered. that hardly seems broken
[3:01:59] fart_boiii: its the alcohol, animal products and cocaine

[3:06:00] MysticalOS: you can keep everuything but sheep together for cleave too. it's more aoe damage during overheat, but also more dps gain, overheat is cast by whelp on himself and nearby enemies, causing them to pull damage but also take 25% increased damage for 15 sec
[3:06:04] Voidbonx: what are you tired from? D:
[3:06:15] M000gul: what is blowback casting I’m curious

[3:06:16] Rusty52986: how was the rest of the raid?
[3:06:22] MysticalOS: under no circomstance should anything be near sheep, cause his reflect is cast on himself AND anyone near him
[3:06:23] Spudea: @StaysafeTV did you make much gold from your p1 herb farming?
[3:06:31] MajurDJ: so the sheep casts an electric buff that makes itself and nearby allies reflect damage. ranged especially need to watch out for that. you can easily see this if the mob has a big electric ball on their model

[3:37:16] ticeyx: warlock is way better then warrior for this its not even close
[3:37:40] gambleragain: are frost prot potions used for P2?

[3:39:36] ticeyx: i can tell you what i did
[3:39:45] MajurDJ: the kick is so easy its just when he is spazzing and oozing green
[3:40:28] bearbot89: u need to tank swap also
[3:40:45] JoeBangles_: 26 days no weed, thanks for your motivation Staysafe
[3:40:53] aoe_enjoyer: boss looks sick
[3:41:07] bone555: KEKW KEKW KEKW
[3:41:16] exnihilo777: dang stacks didn’t clear
[3:41:18] Demonwareltd: you will need more than 1 tank
[3:41:19] leroylol: 1 tapped pog
[3:41:20] 13deadace1: L
[3:41:26] ongtehjem: u gotta clear stacks
[3:41:29] Spudea: you had some kind of debuff
[3:41:30] Demonwareltd: you got debuffx3
[3:41:30] 13deadace1: mekkaCHAD
[3:41:42] Mungtime: oh no dog
[3:41:43] jedi_tony: hits like a truck
[3:41:43] Evilindeed: 3 stacks is fine
[3:41:48] bignerdtv: classic Sod play
[3:41:50] bearbot89: @staysafetv you need to tank swap at 6 stacks
[3:41:54] 13deadace1: need more runes
[3:42:07] FlexiQT: you got hit by bombs
[3:42:12] FlexiQT: and that gave you stacks
[3:42:39] zhuki: NODDERS
[3:42:52] 13deadace1: yooo as a druid one trick im pissed they nerfed starsurge.
[3:42:54] ticeyx: @StaysafeTV from where you enter the room pull to the button on your right, the first pillar there, you can use a button for a speed boost, 1-2 stacks is ok you can eat those and tank, if you have more then 2 stacks you need to keep running til they clear, they can target dummy
[3:42:56] staal__: he stands still when he casts the frontal so you can start running early
[3:43:15] FlexiQT: you stopped right on the spawn of bombs and got unlucky
[3:43:28] Mauraderss: this run is gay
[3:43:30] ticeyx: and instead of kiting straight back you can kite in a circle
[3:43:33] MajurDJ: i dont think you need to run into the bomb area, you can kite him near the entrance from one side to the other like in a bit of an arc around
[3:44:02] bearbot89: we just tanked him centre the full time and tank swaped you group has the dps to push the phases
[3:44:29] ticeyx: if you tank swap its easy mode
[3:44:33] caltex88: lol who cares about loot
[3:44:45] ticeyx: otherwise its super cringe kiting and using dummies
[3:44:45] Raewhen: @13deadace1 starsurge is still aids.
[3:45:05] VagalHunter: !spec
[3:45:05] Nightbot: MY SOLO DUNGEON SPEC: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/warlock/5500253002201005
[3:45:22] ticeyx: bombs dont effect stacks at all
[3:45:27] Demonwareltd: you shouldn't have to dodge bombs - your ranged need to take them out
[3:45:32] nrdoubleu: is this final boss?
[3:45:39] illegalstuff: healer had to stop healing, youd be fine
[3:45:39] Raewhen: Theres nothing like running around and insta dieing to five druids startsurging out of stealth.
[3:45:43] lloydimus: Woot just got Broken tooth. only took me about 30 mins
[3:45:55] Demonwareltd: @Raewhen at least it was nerfed
[3:46:04] salk76: how frequently does gnomer reset?
[3:46:09] tokinbuds4daze: what runes you runing?
[3:46:09] nrdoubleu: opinion on raid so far?
[3:46:11] bearbot89: wipe counter?
[3:46:53] JLowe79: how many times have you downed the last boss?
[3:46:58] FlexiQT: Would you ever play dps spec?
[3:47:15] JLowe79: good luck buddy
[3:47:15] Raewhen: he was hopeing to dps
[3:47:33] FlexiQT: ohh okay
[3:47:37] xangfang: dust to dust
[3:47:40] bearbot89: dyes next pull
[3:48:12] ticeyx: press a button

[3:49:15] RoccoReid: have to 2 tank it?
[3:49:22] bearbot89: it’s a long fight
[3:49:23] Lionkingler1: warlock tank KEL
[3:49:24] flubberfett: @StaysafeTV Check your death log, wtf was that damage
[3:49:28] Frostlicious: Aint no way a pug can clear this
[3:49:34] its_Blocky: This is a fucking retail fight, its so fucking bad
[3:49:39] flubberfett: Ahhh k
[3:49:44] jordano111: weird how he didn't taunt earlier hehe
[3:49:46] ticeyx: 2 things, you can press a button anytime you want a speedboost, pressing a button also gives you MANA so the healers anytime they want can just go press a button for mana
[3:49:54] zaebot3000: @StaysafeTV Make sure you tell them it was my idea ;)
[3:50:36] Hanscakestealer: place is haunted
[3:50:46] Demonwareltd: @its_Blocky it's really not - it just takes some learning
[3:50:47] exnihilo777: insane how well lock can hold agro while kiteing the boss
[3:51:14] coolcrazyguy72: based
[3:51:21] tokinbuds4daze: What runes you running?
[3:51:26] DragonSheet: @staysafetv void walker taunt?

[3:56:02] ticeyx: rest is pretty ez just move away from bombs if they lose control
[3:56:07] Selenar21: getting rekt
[3:56:08] xangfang: ez
[3:56:19] KEK_Jinx: he hits harder the more frost stacks people have
[3:56:30] Frostlicious: LOOOOL
[3:56:32] KEK_Jinx: so FAP is kinda a must have or you need to dispell
[3:56:33] berno100: deleted
[3:56:33] therealrickdiculous: yuuuup
[3:56:35] jedi_tony: F
[3:56:35] Demonwareltd: and STAY DEAD
[3:56:38] EugePlays: thought about running the crit rune on chest for 10% more dodge?
[3:56:42] Lionkingler1: KEKW world first naxx btw
[3:56:42] Krabue: thats why you need fap
[3:56:42] brushbro: caht
[3:56:46] divadnothsa: Someone had 10 atacks
[3:56:47] exnihilo777: did you do Faps that p2?
[3:56:47] FlexiQT: the stacks
[3:56:47] lilkreamys: is that the nature phase
[3:56:49] WalkTheWalk: Someone got to 11 stacks
[3:56:51] lilkreamys: if so u need to kick that
[3:56:51] KEK_Jinx: more frost stacks = more damage
[3:56:52] Ushiroku: Faps make the ice phase sooo ezz
[3:56:53] Punchatron5000: its the stacks
[3:56:53] ticeyx: you cant get 10 stacks
[3:56:53] FlexiQT: add up the dmg it does
[3:56:54] Evilindeed: if anyone is frozen while coolant its wipe
[3:56:55] Tinman_VF: damage based on stacks in raid need to either fap at phase start or be dispelling
[3:56:57] Angeroth: what runes are u rinning??
[3:56:57] ticeyx: 10 stacks you blow up
[3:56:58] bearbot89: to many stacks
[3:56:58] lilkreamys: oh the frost thing
[3:56:59] poorboy55: gotta dispell stacjs
[3:57:00] Angeroth: running**
[3:57:00] lilkreamys: get faps
[3:57:01] ticeyx: dispells and fap
[3:57:03] MajurDJ: no one fapping?
[3:57:03] normageqq: honestly surprised you haven't done this yet with your dps
[3:57:04] iknowido: 1200 dmg on some of those hits
[3:57:04] MajurDJ: wait
[3:57:09] lilkreamys: we used fapts when you get 2 stacks then you cant get anymore
[3:57:09] bearbot89: dispells
[3:57:11] Lionkingler1: KEKW wiping to not using faps
[3:57:12] Demonwareltd: gotta clear those bombs on priority
[3:57:14] divadnothsa: It's displeable
[3:57:23] Evilindeed: frost res totem
[3:57:23] ticeyx: or you can escape artist but you are the filthy race
[3:57:27] Tinman_VF: dispell or prefap stacks easy
[3:57:28] KEK_Jinx: @StaysafeTV the more stacks others have the more damage the boss wil do to you
[3:57:33] blackmashoo: Soul link tankier than that.
[3:57:33] Nightbot: 1-25: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/warlock/45002-23/1BA0BaaEaa |RESPEC| 25-60: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/warlock/3500203512-205230312250005/1CADeeGhK0BaaEajGHK1MejjR
[3:57:34] lilkreamys: the tank ideally shouldnt have any stacks faps r really really good for this
[3:57:36] ticeyx: you can be soul link and be more tanky
[3:57:38] warboy80: stoneshield potion
[3:57:40] citruu: are u playing the soul link spec?
[3:57:46] MajurDJ: @StaysafeTV the boss does more damage based on how many total stacks the raid has, and you guys had a ton of raid wide stacks. if you guys fap he will hit way less hard
[3:57:47] ticeyx: soul link+void walker is what i used
[3:57:48] bearbot89: bombs gives the stacks
[3:57:51] Ariosity: the druids can shift in in out of form to clear debuff
[3:57:59] staal__: pretty sure boss frontal also gives stacks
[3:57:59] Sowiloo: yes soul link
[3:58:05] bearbot89: need to be on top of killing them
[3:58:05] Ariosity: its a slow so any FAP or anything like that does to
[3:58:08] EugePlays: @StaysafeTV what about running 10% Crit rune on chest to up your dodge?
[3:58:12] superglubag: i watched my guild wipe to this for like 2 hrs earlier it was pretty poggers
[3:58:13] ticeyx: soul link+voidwalker he was still hitting me for 500
[3:58:17] Area51Labs: what about pvp trinket
[3:58:19] KEK_Jinx: @StaysafeTV the more stacks others have the more damage the boss wil do to you 󠀀
[3:58:20] JLowe79: do you have any defense cooldowns as a lock?
[3:58:32] FlexiQT: the boss mele attacks- deal more and more dmg, depends on your stacks
[3:58:57] Evilindeed: @StaysafeTV frost res and fire res totem for those two phases
[3:59:05] Lionkingler1: entirely cheeses it YEP
[3:59:05] Tinman_VF: correct
[3:59:10] KEK_Jinx: pop it as soon as he does his first aoe stack
[3:59:25] ticeyx: it can be dispelled too
[3:59:30] Mahca_: you can wait a few seconds into phase to pop fap too
[3:59:53] KEK_Jinx: it has a cast and while he casts you FAP
[3:59:53] Ariosity: druids should never get a single stack so avoidable fr
[4:00:07] realandtruephobe: Just tuned in, glad I didn't miss the raid!

[4:00:15] Ariosity: we couldnt clear him with mcconnell last night
[4:00:17] Zyxst_: Why is the shield tank not on the boss?
[4:00:25] Lionkingler1: healer just have to step up their healing game
[4:00:37] exnihilo777: pull 5 inc, making good progression.
[4:00:49] NutterCircus: You can tell they wanted a warrior to tank this due to the mitigation.
[4:00:52] FlexiQT: does the paladin have diving sac?
[4:01:22] Demonwareltd: When Jokerd ran this they definitely need multiple healers to mitigate dmg
[4:01:25] AxelFromAustralia: what boss are you up to?
[4:01:26] divadnothsa: Have playing frost aura on tanks?
[4:01:28] Shad604: @StaysafeTV biden fetterman 24
