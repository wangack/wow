[2:56:53] wildwittra: talk about food or training ?
[2:56:56] dpquig: no
[2:57:02] fyethis: I enjoy depletes
[2:57:05] bumpledore: id enjoy certain bosses but overall no
[2:57:07] dpquig: granted my farm raid is upt o Tindral
[2:57:09] B3nbu: dps people enjoy it more
[2:57:11] Divinuss_: depends if man has gear to get init
[2:57:11] riotscream: if its drinks w/ the boys no wipes the kinda
[2:57:40] serrafin: I like watching people mess up on farm raids so I feel better about my boosted ass
[2:57:47] Im_anDe: idm farm. get some parses, gear and hang with the boys. Sadly there hasn't been much gear these last 2 tiers since the upgrade system is a bit too overtuned
[2:58:17] Im_anDe: i get that it's way more boring for healers and tanks tho
[3:00:10] riotscream: @Naowh s thought on how to change the way in w/ mythic is hard , when 1 fuck up is a wipe its no fun. i cant convince ppl to even try dragon flight .
[3:00:37] riotscream: or 1 shot mech
[3:01:06] dpquig: yeahhhhhh
[3:01:27] riotscream: there is no of uck we recoverd hype
[3:01:44] Im_anDe: freedom soon
[3:01:45] dpquig: its because last read there wasnt as many issues with the healers being this strong
[3:01:48] wildwittra: has the nerfed T.swift been noticable for you ?
[3:01:56] drkuusshh: if you didnt have to raid would u still do it?
[3:02:42] Im_anDe: rip
[3:03:24] riotscream: has the vault not fixed that w/ loot?
[3:03:46] lilsammy777: doing raid +20
[3:03:48] lilsammy777: Imagine
[3:04:39] riotscream: could the do it  +1 %hp and dmg to raid bosses and would it really be fun?
[3:04:49] ohbby11: I thought the goal was to play dps. If you're playing tank in raid anyway, why leave echo?
[3:05:25] Skorgg: they should just add random m+ affix per pull
[3:05:34] Skorgg: bolstering sanguine fyrakk
[3:06:11] riotscream: i know i was at prob 16 to 20 hrs a day in legion m+ start to finish , now im less then 2/3 hrs a week on live
