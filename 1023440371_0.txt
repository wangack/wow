[1:43:19] Ponzie: You using the Logitech chair Towelliee?
[1:43:56] Vexxsis: nvr had slouching issues
[1:43:57] CaptainJoeyNY: I rock a  European style recliner, I ditches the desk, and I have a shelf laid across the armrests for my mouse and keyboard.
[1:43:58] Collected1: i'm a terrible sloucher
[1:44:07] oberik1: Embody? Just got mine delivered yesterday
[1:44:08] Korupcija_: placebo effect?
[1:44:12] CaptainJoeyNY: And i have a 55inch flatscree=n for a monitor
[1:44:18] sagethemage40: LETS GOOOOO TOWEL
[1:44:39] Korupcija_: I mean if I bought 1.5k chair I'd sit straight
[1:44:45] DyedFuelOnly: same with me, I was sore for a good month when I was adapting to proper posture
[1:44:47] Collected1: i get back pain just from bending over for more than a few seconds so i need to start fixing it
[1:44:49] Korupcija_: just 'cause I'd think about price
[1:44:51] wrec7: lmao
[1:44:58] Baldarsar: still 1100 to much
[1:45:07] conv3rge_: @Collected1 Absolutely, couldn't have said it any better, a great health investment.
[1:45:16] Vexxsis: @collected1 stretch often
[1:45:39] Sombiefog: This is true. This is what kills the man.
[1:46:09] Collected1: Vexxsis : yeah I need to start that or i'll be crippled in later age
[1:46:19] Bulgogiprince: $1100 for a 10 year use chair isn't that bad
[1:46:36] Wildside1177: @Bulgogiprince I think they have a 17 year warranty.
[1:46:36] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:46:44] ForgottnHero21: 1100 doesn't seem to much for something you might use 8 hours a day almost every day
[1:46:48] Vexxsis: @collected1 I'm 37 and I do in depth stretching makes a difference
[1:46:56] Collected1: 42 here
[1:47:06] Vexxsis: but I also don't feel my age either
[1:47:15] Nehcrom: 45 here.
[1:47:20] wrec7: its so nice i switched a year or so ago from razer to logitech
[1:47:21] Collected1: i'm starting to feel my age after feeling 21 forever
[1:47:34] Bulgogiprince: Exactly, If a chair that you spend in 8 hours a day is good quality I am all down for that

[1:47:36] Firelordxsrx: Hola
[1:47:49] DreamWebb: fair warning logitech g hub sucks donkey balls
[1:47:52] Wildside1177: Some of the less expensive herman millers are still amazing. I am getting one in the $600 range after I move.
[1:48:10] Vexxsis: I'm all corsair atm
[1:48:15] fewyn: i have a naga, the big razer mousepad, and a corsair keyboard
[1:48:16] lumaday: peripheral mercenary
[1:48:17] MOLAR305: I'm razer mouse, logitech keyboard
[1:48:35] fewyn: i used to use a steelseries mouse mat
[1:48:50] Collected1: Wildside1177 : I'm looking at the Mirra 2
[1:48:58] Sarcastard: I still enjoy my Lay Z boy swivel rocker for a computer chair
[1:49:03] Garrujak: when this razer keyboard inevitably breaks, I'll end up going corsair because razer killed the 5 side keys off <_<
[1:49:26] Sandman_88: has toweliee seen the LaHee clip?
[1:49:27] fewyn: i really like my k70 with brown switches
[1:49:37] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: when are you gamin with the senors
[1:49:42] Dkgungo: i used to only use razer products but i felt quality took a hit now i use all logitech
[1:49:47] DreamWebb: brown is tacticle
[1:49:52] Sarcastard: Bring Back the MERC STEALTH... best keyboard ever
[1:49:55] fewyn: you get a good feel and it's not super loud
[1:49:58] Vexxsis: k95 plat here
[1:50:07] Wootiify: own built keyboard with lubed linear switches. Denon headphones
[1:50:15] zSKIz1: Aren‚Äôt brown considered tactile
[1:50:22] Simmo_rs: Why do you say brown is best?
[1:50:23] zSKIz1: And red green are linear?
[1:50:35] geewiz70: @DreamWebb Brown is tactile only if you press your keys in slow motion
[1:50:47] conv3rge_: also using a custom keyboard with lubed frankenstein switches (holy bobas)
[1:50:59] Doog45: Doog45 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 88 months! new room completed?
[1:51:16] LawnSpeaker: He said brown are basically linear, their bump isn‚Äôt very pronounced
[1:51:17] geewiz70: Currently typing on T1s. Genuinely tactile.
[1:51:22] DreamWebb: @geewiz70 theyre still tacticle no matter how fast you push them LUL
[1:51:27] Vexxsis: sexy
[1:51:30] nethazahr: mmmmm beautiful
[1:51:33] Lexxania: keyboard asmr lol
[1:51:34] Korupcija_: DansGame
[1:51:34] Firelordxsrx: lol
[1:51:41] inj0shwetrust: Type writer sound
[1:51:42] Vexxsis: bought to go fap now
[1:51:43] dream_boxing: Morning Towelliee and chat!!
[1:51:45] inj0shwetrust: I dig it
[1:51:56] Vexxsis: lol
[1:51:57] SamAddams: What level key is the pro-am? @towelliee
[1:52:05] IronPhalanX: do it again only slower
[1:52:12] Collected1: GX blue is a god damn typewriter
[1:52:17] Vexxsis: Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:52:27] A_New_Challenger: If any sponsors are in chat...I just think we are missing a mark. I really want to know what twitch streamers drive...it would greatly influence purchasing decision if I knew Towelliee preferred a new BMW  over a Corvette...just saying
[1:53:13] Collected1: I've had my Ducky for about 10 years now and it's as good as the day i bought it
[1:53:14] A_New_Challenger: get this man a new BMW :)
[1:53:16] oopat11: what keyboard u got now
[1:53:27] DreamWebb: i would honestly get someone to make you a custom KB the quality and the personalisation is such on another level compared to off the shelf
[1:53:29] muhbuhtuh: new C8 is nice imo
[1:53:45] Korupcija_: Exorsus just tweeted they're quitting hardcore
[1:53:55] michaisn: I hate that logitech won't add PBT, they are still using ABS unlike razer who started listening to the community
[1:53:58] zSKIz1: @geewiz70 even Logitech site just said brown is tactile
[1:53:59] geewiz70: @DreamWebb I agree.
[1:54:12] zSKIz1: Red being the linear
[1:54:13] Garrujak: Damn right, it's better than yours (the headset)

[1:54:32] pixxelina: what headset do you use?
[1:54:34] geewiz70: @GryzSki That they say doesn't mean they are. Compare them with T1s, Holy Pandas, Zealio V2 or others and you'll see what I mean.
[1:54:56] zSKIz1: I‚Äôve used every iteration first hand. Blue brown green red
[1:55:05] A_New_Challenger: I appreciate the way you promote products a lot...always keeping it real and it seems like you are only ever showing us quality stuff
[1:55:21] LawnSpeaker: @gryzski it isn‚Äôt if you compare it to actual tactiles
[1:55:25] Katalystgb: The good esports i guess
[1:55:26] zSKIz1: Blue Brown are definitely tactile. Red green are linear. I guess I‚Äôm talking about Cherry MX
[1:55:57] DreamWebb: im sad senheisser sold their consumer audio division üò¢
[1:56:04] geewiz70: @GryzSki When you limit yourself to Cherry, you're right. But you're doing yourself a disservice.
[1:56:06] Vexxsis: no one uses turtle beach anymore..I remember when I got a pair on xbox 360
[1:56:11] Kaihrn: Beyerdynamic have been around for years and mainly sponser big bands music studio producers etc
[1:56:19] Sollice: Yes
[1:56:28] Vexxsis: idk
[1:56:30] zSKIz1: Are the new caps that good @geewiz70
[1:56:30] conv3rge_: @geewiz70 Everything is preference. People don't have to have $1.50 switches to enjoy their keyboard lol
[1:56:44] Sollice: I dont know why he would continue that. Has ANYONE ever equated Turtle Beach with anything good
[1:56:44] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:56:45] zSKIz1: I have a das brown for work and really like it for typing
[1:56:53] LawnSpeaker: @michaisn what‚Äôs so bad about abs?
[1:57:09] Shugaze: dont think twitch viewers are a market for Beyers
[1:57:26] michaisn: @LawnSpeaker it degrades faster, and it gets oily
[1:57:26] zSKIz1: No. I think Jessica bought them for Valentine‚Äôs Day
[1:57:29] geewiz70: @GryzSki There are so many switch brands that are better than Cherry. IMHO Cherry is only surviving by quantity because of their OEM contracts. Certainly not on quality.
[1:57:39] Sollice: @Towelliee The 770 pro I got them for 168 or something
[1:57:46] bdobbi: I remember when Turtle beach came out with the streamer headset and some pretty big streamers had to pretend it wasn't awful for months
[1:57:47] DreamWebb: what beyers are 550?
[1:58:00] Vexxsis: I do want to get the glasses you have
[1:58:13] trivwik: @Towelliee I have oondasta up what is toon name?
[1:58:20] lithium364: just realized e3 is in 4 weeks already
[1:58:22] Sollice: He is wearing 990 pros
[1:58:23] Vexxsis: that will be my next buy
[1:58:26] LawnSpeaker: @michaisn isn‚Äôt that difference a bit overstated though?
[1:58:29] trivwik: !bta
[1:58:31] trivwik: !btag
[1:58:31] Moobot: @trivotixx NA Btag | Towelliee#1402
[1:58:35] Shugaze: steelseries headset too
[1:58:36] i_master_baite: Astro A50 wireless is insanely good
[1:58:39] magemaster225: exorsus posted a twitlonger saying they are gonna be a casual guild
[1:58:39] hikkbro: astro a50's i had a set
[1:58:41] zSKIz1: @geewiz70 I have the Logitech g915 currently
[1:58:45] hikkbro: they were great till the battery died
[1:58:48] Kaihrn: but beyerdynamic headsets will last for years and years so defo worth the dosh

[1:59:08] michaisn: @LawnSpeaker yea but if one company can pull it out for a cheapper price there is no reason for them not to

[1:59:24] BritDean: ive just bought AKG 712's they are very good
[1:59:25] inj0shwetrust: I had A50s wireless ... still have em for xbox
[1:59:29] inj0shwetrust: theyre trash
[1:59:38] Sollice: I bought the 770 pro and a Fosi Audio Amp ( nothing crazy ) or 250
[1:59:39] geewiz70: @GryzSki You can start by getting yourself a switch tester with samples of the other brands. Then pick one you like and kit a whole hotswap keyboard with it. Worlds of difference.
[1:59:39] inj0shwetrust: the a40s with the mixamp are legit though
[1:59:42] trivwik: Anyone know the name and server Towelliee is currently on right now?
[1:59:43] Sollice: Best audio decision I have done
[1:59:49] Katalystgb: bargain
[1:59:55] WSeveryn: @Towelliee still using the HyperX Cloud Revolver.. still works great for me
[1:59:56] trivwik: I have Oondasta up

[2:00:27] trivwik: I sent it
[2:00:31] geewiz70: @GryzSki But maybe don't. That's how I started. Now I have >$2k in custom keyboards on my shelf. LUL
[2:00:49] DreamWebb: you should get a pair of HD800s before one of the best headphones made
[2:00:59] LawnSpeaker: @michaisn idk whose key caps are better, but abs vs pbt isn‚Äôt the only thing to consider
[2:01:01] phyrexian570: any thoughts on trying the new corsair k100??
[2:01:17] LawnSpeaker: Just look at how much people spend on gmk sets
[2:01:20] trivwik: @Towelliee Trivotix#1684

[2:13:17] SincerelyAGH: idek who that is but ok
[2:13:30] MrKhanes: The whole world have closed down becaude of covid, so delays are to be expected with a patch in a game.

[2:16:37] iblighters: I think no x.3 patch would be bad
[2:16:46] UglyGang420: You think they might drop wrath classic after shadowlands so they have more time to make the newest expansion?

[2:17:57] Bombayshow: e3 kinda dying too
[2:17:57] dracullus: @Towelliee don't you think Blizzard at this point would confirm no season 4? Ion already said it won't be WoD situation

[2:18:43] LucidAntics: yes ^
[2:18:50] Vexxsis: werd
[2:18:53] manmower: sort of a reverse WoD situation
[2:19:07] iblighters: What he means by "not a like WoD" is cutting a raid tier
[2:19:14] LucidAntics: In the sloot interview he asked if we're gonna get a mini raid and they said no plans for it :(
[2:19:28] LucidAntics: i really hope we dont just get 3 raids this expansion :(
[2:19:45] talic420: 3
[2:19:56] dracullus: @Towelliee 3 raids, 30 bosses
[2:20:01] iblighters: 3 raids 2 "tiers"

[2:20:42] smashwow: And so are the patches ü§£
[2:20:59] dracullus: @Towelliee that's why I wonder if they could release Wrath early '23 if 10.0 will take too long
[2:21:12] IronPhalanX: wrath classic before next expac?
[2:21:18] Sollice: No way lol
[2:21:21] Vexxsis: I needy reaper class

[2:22:07] inj0shwetrust: How hard will classic andys mald when Naxx is reused in Wrath classic?
[2:22:07] Vexxsis: decent amount of time
[2:22:24] Mosoner: How come?
[2:22:26] Vexxsis: I won't be in wrath
[2:22:30] inj0shwetrust: Also WInsterspring classic
[2:22:32] LucidAntics: @inj0shwetrust they shouldnt considering most of them were around to play OG wrath, and it was a decent tier
[2:22:36] belfastcl: wotlk did feel like it had two different stages, until ulduar, after ulduar
[2:22:43] submotion: @Towelliee how do you even keep track on what chars you've done worldbosses LUL
[2:22:43] UglyGang420: I‚Äôm going to level a dk to max and be done
[2:22:45] Dkgungo: im looking forward to wrath just because i loved early dks
[2:23:00] cruzeal: towUnforch
[2:23:08] talic420: don't care about any of it been there done that when classic was out at that time
[2:23:11] manmower: wish they would just dump all resources on retail and then expand timewalking features for those who want nostalgia
[2:23:11] Vexxsis: frost tank was fun
[2:23:26] Tyduss89: hmm what is your top 3 expansions your loved?
[2:23:30] Vexxsis: naxx 25 was a joke
[2:23:33] dracullus: of course it wil be, they won't release Uldurar with launch

[2:23:39] Wildside1177: It is the same as the original. Better if anything'
[2:23:49] Mosoner: Where they go with Classic after Wrath? People didnt love Cata
[2:23:50] MOLAR305: I love wrath, but nax 25 still chaps my ass
[2:23:57] manmower: they're sort of dividing their playerbase
[2:23:59] LucidAntics: theyll stop at wrath
[2:24:19] Vexxsis: nope
[2:24:25] Exodeo_: You can play both too though
[2:24:33] Vexxsis: as long as that sub is active
[2:25:07] mavericks312: I feel after 9.2 blizz should be back on track and able to catch up
[2:25:14] 3663Sharad: I wouldnt be to surprised about a "Classic" sub and a Retail sub of some sort as soon enough Classic xpacs are released
[2:25:18] Mosoner: After Wrath do they do Fresh start Classic?
[2:25:18] LucidAntics: Idk if I'm a rare species cuz i really want retail to be good again, and i only want the classic servers there to fix my nostalgic itch
[2:25:26] DreamWebb: i think it matters having more people spread and less to play with on my desired version of wow kind of affects the game no?
[2:25:31] dracullus: all people left (and actively play) Classic Era will be just people that would play some private Classic server instead
[2:25:31] Vexxsis: @mavericks312 hopefully
[2:25:38] Alepouditsa: yea i will play tbc till 9.1 is out
[2:25:43] Tyduss89: they should branch off after tbc and do something new with it and not do a wotlk
[2:25:45] mavericks312: wrath will most likely be the last classic xpac
[2:25:54] Molvonos: @Tyduss89 Never gonna happen homie.
[2:26:05] iblighters: I'm glad people are getting the versions of the game they like but I can't do the older versions, it's so slow
[2:26:21] Tyduss89: always can have high hope right? xD
[2:26:23] mavericks312: @tyduss89 the classic wrath xpac is gonna print them money
[2:26:27] Vexxsis: that q time
[2:26:52] VBTIGER89: You just got to meet the right people
[2:26:56] Vexxsis: right.. retail won't matter, classic yes
[2:26:57] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:26:59] manmower: retail might already scratch the arthas itch if story pans out
[2:27:05] Vexxsis: it is
[2:27:11] Toradin: 100%
[2:27:19] Brodih_: TBC has less elite/group quests yeah
[2:27:25] Vexxsis: few group things obviously..but more solo friendly
[2:27:50] uberhart: nice we can do it solo in pre patch
[2:28:04] Vexxsis: tbc was always my fav
[2:28:10] Brodih_: Will talent cost be reset to 1g ?
[2:28:13] fennecx25: what is that rarity addon u have?
[2:28:15] SquidSACC: can you hop into tbc not playing any classic before?
[2:28:17] Collected1: the two weeks man. it kills me.
[2:28:19] OJWestTV: so excited
[2:28:25] Toradin: i will stay in BC at the end))
[2:28:32] Vexxsis: same
[2:28:33] SavageCheez: I'm solo leveling at the moment, and I don't mind. Pretty fun.
[2:28:43] Lightz__: how are you going to level thru tbc
[2:29:19] neostormx: I started playing Classic 3 weeks ago in anticipation of TBC. I'm 47 now so, almost there!!
[2:29:34] dalaraz: with proper calculations you need round 8hours per day to make it in 2 weeks :p sad times
[2:29:35] WSeveryn: @Towelliee I enjoyed BC a ton, being a raider and a tank on a Paladin was great.  But now I have a women in my life and a manager position at work.  Just not sure how much time I will have, and that sucks
[2:29:39] Vexxsis: @neostormx  11 lvls to go
[2:29:41] feninr: pre raid bis items
[2:29:53] Snabido: Are there classic  stuff that are still useful into late/endgame tbc

[2:30:22] Sarocus: Dont you need revered with the factions for heroics, too?
[2:30:26] Vexxsis: right.. factions are a must in tbc
[2:30:29] Sarocus: or the keys, at least
[2:30:45] Collected1: 4 days played over 2 weeks is still pretty brutal
[2:31:09] Mosoner: Very, 8+ hours a day
[2:31:11] stallowned: u can get them done in a day
[2:31:12] Vexxsis: there easy lol
[2:31:18] Sarocus: Just saying its another reason to level in dungeons
[2:31:23] MOLAR305: the reason attunement sucked was pigging it for specific dungeons
[2:31:24] pavepawns: but its sooooooo boooooooring
[2:31:27] Brodih_: nothing like alliance Onyxia
[2:31:29] MOLAR305: pugging**

[2:31:47] SilkeySmooth: how long to you thong pre patch maintenance will be?
[2:31:51] dracullus: @Towelliee it's 2021 playing game is 'boring'
[2:31:53] throwawaym3: Playing the game is boring lol
[2:31:54] feninr: @Towelliee as someone who has played on pservers for years the pserver community is GIGA toxic and will try and force everyone else away.
[2:32:04] Kaihrn: haha its playing the game and it comes with it lol

[3:09:18] DragonofWolves: Yeah I spent a lot of time on PSO, so I'm looking forward to this one
[3:09:20] Mostdangspy: Everquest came out in 1999
[3:09:30] Mosoner: Dreamcast had the worst protection of any console in like history lol

[3:09:46] Skylin3r: lol yeah
[3:10:02] DragonofWolves: But my take on the whole charity thing, who care if teams support the same charities. If anything their supporting chairities that do more than do less.
[3:10:17] neostormx: I have anti aliasing and full shadows and Im still getting 144 fps. Beautiful engine
