[0:29:21] TheCornRatsss: it takes 2 days for the trade to settle. but theres diffrent type of rules depending how you buy and sell depending on alot of stuff... your country, your broker and on what market.  But you can buy and sell on same day, but  you cannot claim irs returns on losses for those since theres a rule...

[2:08:07] Tukasasx: It takes 21,000 reputation to go from 0 Neutral to 0 Revered. For non-humans, you will get 4050 reputation from the new campaign in Zereth Mortis by the time you finish chapter 7 and unlock your 2nd legendary. If you do each of your 3 weeklies available each week, you’ll gain an additional 7000 reputation by the Tuesday of Week 5. That knocks out 11050 reputation just from weeklies and campaign quests, leaving 9950 reputation to gain from other sources.

[3:03:51] FaithGiant_Ps91: @ryanblue98 Lol, it’s true
[3:03:53] PureePlayer: Good. Boosting is never how the game was intended to be played.
[3:04:28] allamer1719: But pay blizzard and can boost character
[3:04:50] Tukasasx: Thanks for listening blizzard! D:
[3:04:55] Methos911: a /follow works but cant be used by mods

[3:05:39] logiethepotato: man, /follow has been around forever
[3:05:46] ryanblue98: they should nerf the exp needed by 70% then no one would need boost

[3:06:59] FaithGiant_Ps91: Ok… So what’s the addon called that shows the healer symbol over health bars?
[3:07:01] PureePlayer: @legoess except I don’t. I play the game as it was intended to be played lol. I’m just saying if it came down to it, I’d rather pay for the character boost via blizzard, than a no name website for in game gold to then use on boosting.
[3:07:08] Netflyerr: launch that is hehe
[3:07:38] Methos911: here you got. hope this helps:  The behavior it prevents is for UI Mods to initiate a follow on their own based on receiving a message from another source, such as a message from another player.
