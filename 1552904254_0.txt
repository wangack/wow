[0:30:02] mmrghost7: i'm not playing s4 , no new raid=not enough fun
[0:30:16] Molvonos: @mmrghost7 That's unfortunate
[0:30:35] Molvonos: It's been a blast with my guildies so far.  towNod
[0:31:02] mashiesmashie: there has been a max of 3 people online in mine (1 being me)
[0:31:05] mmrghost7: i think all can agree new raid allways brings a breath of fresh air to the game
[0:31:29] Ribbwich: maybe for some people
[0:31:48] Molvonos: @mmrghost7 Bad habit to try and speak for everyone.  I'd rather have this season 4 rather than an absolute drought.  But you do you, boo.
[0:31:53] Thoreya: TGIF
[0:31:56] Thoreya: and also s4 is good.
[0:32:00] Thoreya: m+ dungeons are fun
[0:32:21] Molvonos: They're not going to develop a raid when there's no 'reason' for it, since the expansion is officially over.
[0:32:41] Ribbwich: a good guild means a lot
[0:32:49] Molvonos: So Season 4 is a fantastic test to breathe new life into the game when there was previously just drought for months and months.
[0:33:05] Thoreya: they just needa nerf kara
[0:33:12] Thoreya: and m+ will be gucci
[0:33:37] Molvonos: Definitely some tuning needs to happen.  Getting obliterated on Docks by quaking was no bueno
[0:35:31] Ribbwich: idk getting obliterated in a mythic near the end of an expansion sounds like someone's good time

[1:40:16] Jack_the_Dipper: 'Broxigar (a.k.a Broxigar the Red, Broxigar the Red Axe, or simply Brox) was a veteran orc warrior whose comrades were slaughtered in battle and who sought his own death in battle because of his guilt. Sent back in time to the War of the Ancients, Brox became an important figure in the war, and was chronologically the first orc ever encountered on Azeroth in the new altered timeline. At the final battle of the war, Broxigar leapt through the portal opening in the collapsing Well of Eternity'

[2:02:44] pavepawns: that too
[2:03:11] pavepawns: real sad hours :(

[2:07:31] dimofodi: @Towelliee even if you can't use the ability you can see how high the stacks go and then do math to see what in theory it would hit for.
[2:08:09] maccaruso: People still play warrior?
[2:08:24] akia03: and warrior is also so broken so not really a point testing them
[2:08:46] Rumbly98: is the arms artifact ability in the tree?
[2:08:46] Ragura: is fatality unlimited stacks?
[2:09:22] Shrenko: probably hard to keep up the stacks though in a raid situation ?

[3:10:01] AwelessOne: prot warrior update next week, equipping shield is 3 point talent
[3:10:04] iisobase: I’m sure the devs did at least a dungeon with a warrior in it
[3:10:14] jkitchin75: nerf into next week
[3:10:40] reggiepowa: I think they fked up by bringing smf back, they should have just allowed one handers to be tmoged on 2 handers and everyone would be happy
[3:10:43] SupAngrytroll: ignorance is bliss
[3:11:52] Ohdies: It shouldn’t be considered a nerf. A nerf comes after blizz makes a decision to release something into prod. Right now, everything is in dev
[3:12:39] ashnmsr: single minded fury should give like 30% cd reduction

[4:29:27] Nico_vdM: true true
[4:29:40] DeanoTV: Kara POGGERS love this dungeon
[4:29:54] Sollice: Who is playing retail in arms and is fairly high ilvl?
[4:30:46] EKS90_: @Sollice only 270 so far, but arms in heroic fated raids.
[4:31:07] Sollice: Whats your haste rating
[4:31:12] Sollice: err %
[4:31:45] EKS90_: 22, and 30 crit
[4:32:00] EKS90_: not to much optimized gear but working on it. bad trinkets etc.
[4:32:06] Sollice: Yeah mine is too low. No buffs at all Crit 26 Haste 15 Mastery 33
[4:34:05] EKS90_: yeah i just switched from fury when s4 launched cause i prefer arms and wanted to try it, but my general knowledge is that crit is the most important followed by haste then mastery, so trying to find a blance with most pieces having crit, then one of the other stats.
[4:34:14] EKS90_: mostly haste over mastery according to my stat weights
[4:35:22] Sollice: Yeah. CN normal still has a lot of upgrades for me and they are haste items
[4:35:32] lsachillies13: MMM brewmaster? And this turn of events?
[4:37:13] EKS90_: wowheads gear page has updated with out bis list, like upgrading what drops to tier set etc, but like 4 drops are from sylvanas haha
[4:37:14] ninetysix: chat is karazhan raid fated now ?
[4:37:25] EKS90_: no, the dungeons from legion is.
[4:37:35] NickLeonhearth: @ninetysix nope
[4:37:36] Sollice: @Commander_Eggi Is it just the warrior arms page you see that on WoWhead
[4:38:28] EKS90_: @Commander_Eggi yes, just go to arms section press gear and u will see that for instance our tier legs could be upgraded from the legs from stone legion, cause those have good stats.
[4:39:02] EKS90_: not stats, but easier to get this first week i guess.

[4:41:19] unc0de: it was great
[4:41:25] PhillyRhino: Stop, drop and roll is the obvious way to put out flame wreaths
[4:42:15] PvtHudson093: KEKW
[4:42:18] lovemymage: legion dungeon are harder, but people also just don't these mechanics. Also boss with kicks is pugs worst nightmare

[5:07:39] SirVoro: Friday drunk keys were so fun PepeHands
[5:07:39] ArcaneMaki: OH noooo! Terryble no longer plays?
[5:07:43] unc0de: its because your dps is split on adds
[5:07:45] Shattermare: @theitalianstallion321 He’s smart lol
[5:07:49] unc0de: need to focus 1 and range interrupt the others
[5:07:54] Keyastaron_: TERRYYYYY MOOOO
[5:07:57] Keyastaron_: NOOOO
[5:08:04] unc0de: ya, thats a big nope
[5:08:05] TheItalianStallion321: @Shattermare lol
[5:08:08] loutre_malgache: Pretty sure it's better to kill the mirror one by one to reduce the group damage taken
[5:08:12] supernohva_xt: No you never solo adds lol
[5:08:29] unc0de: @loutre_malgache yep
[5:08:30] supernohva_xt: to much damage
[5:08:34] Brodih_: lol
[5:08:38] LearnedSomething: first try PogChamp
[5:08:38] supernohva_xt: surprised the pirest kept you guys a live
[5:08:39] Mojohusk: Cow size
[5:08:39] Shattermare: Last boss is most overtuned in here
[5:08:40] Keyastaron_: that always happens
[5:08:41] ArcaneMaki: Can't believe Terryble stopped playing :(
[5:08:43] Seerated: LoL
[5:08:43] Delkamus04: LUL LUL LUL
[5:08:50] PvtHudson093: Look we're in Delaware
[5:08:52] watpuppy: SHWING
[5:08:55] BoezIRL: a bad jump
[5:09:03] Snabido: Thats a classic and perma kara affix 😏
[5:09:03] Keyastaron_: OR msybe just doesnt have time
[5:09:12] ArcaneMaki: He was the disengage master
[5:09:15] Keyastaron_: yea and mage and such
[5:09:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: ask him to help for the marathon again
[5:09:24] c0mmander_starscream: Did DCarter quit WoW? dont see him on as much these days
[5:09:25] Ertra: according to subcreation, BM is only B tier
[5:09:28] Shattermare: BM is not op right now unless you play Arena
[5:09:33] NBK_Sethus: Karazhan FeelsStrongMan
[5:09:38] Nico_vdM: some suggest not to worry about orbs since it may be bugged
[5:09:48] BoezIRL: @Shattermare in df
[5:09:53] Billo0w: @Shattermare think he meant for DF
[5:10:04] Seerated: Naguura posted a vid that this boss never reaches full mana anyways, so you don't have to collect the orbs unless you want the dmg
[5:10:11] Shattermare: In that case no one knows KEKW
[5:10:15] Seerated: -increas
[5:10:19] watpuppy: I really wish Blizz did novelty dungeons like this more often.  They're always the most fun.
[5:10:19] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[5:10:34] vulkankragon: @c0mmander_starscream he said he moved on to ffxiv
[5:10:37] PvtHudson093: Lower needs another tuning pass
[5:10:51] watpuppy: 69%
[5:10:54] lovemymage: your over count
[5:11:04] Shattermare: 69%
[5:11:06] trivotix: a good chest can be like 18 years of child support
[5:11:24] KingSlayerYotam: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonriding-multiplayer-races-race-with-up-to-4-players-in-dragonflight-328108 didn't know they made races official PogChamp
[5:11:30] FezzikGG: I feel like Lower is still overtuned. I would like to see a repass for it
[5:11:37] Ziggy_Da_Wizard: hey towelliee shadowlands kinda killed my wow vibe. its always been my favorite game. do you think dragonflight will rekindle the spark for people?
[5:11:42] Shattermare: @¥
[5:11:56] saikouusagi: !alpha
[5:11:56] Moobot: @saikouusagi ALPHA PHASE 4 - Dracthyr Starting Zone/Thaldraszus (68-70) Gotta be Warrior week right? | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. Beta in a month?
[5:12:01] Nico_vdM: its only 1% vers per
[5:12:08] Nico_vdM: Not 2% like with haste and crit
[5:12:19] nvnto: vers got nerfed down to 1%
[5:12:24] TheItalianStallion321: soak the orbs
[5:12:28] TheItalianStallion321: no just the orbs
[5:12:31] pavepawns: u soak the orbs
[5:12:40] pavepawns: and go into tornado to drop stacks
[5:12:54] TheItalianStallion321: all 5 of you have to soak, not just the tank
[5:12:59] raye_gaming22: you geta huge dot
[5:13:22] Nico_vdM: see the orbs dont do anything atm to boss
[5:13:39] leaprah: remove dot by standing in purple pools
[5:13:47] Gerdubus: stand in the pool for a bit and drop some stacks to give your healer a break\
[5:13:49] NEMERL: clear the stack
[5:13:49] unc0de: lol
[5:13:55] unc0de: this poor healer
[5:13:59] K4ykay: is the entire dungeon just overtuned?
[5:14:02] NEMERL: clear the stack insice the crcle @Towelliee
[5:14:05] Scoodles91: you soak the orbs then move in the puddle to clean the stacks
[5:14:13] Gerdubus: always has been
[5:14:13] unc0de: this dungeon is actually easy lol
[5:14:15] DeanoTV: toight like a tiger
[5:14:24] lovemymage: you have wiped multiple time and over pulled
[5:14:27] unc0de: lower kara is a bitch
[5:14:30] Seerated: toiger*
[5:14:31] yuca247n: i heard lower/upper kara was bugged did they fix it?
[5:14:31] Shattermare: @unc0de Not currently
[5:14:40] Keyastaron_: hows the affix?
[5:14:44] Nico_vdM: just a little over count, barely even noticeable
[5:14:49] Jerry48038: Jerry48038 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[5:14:55] NEMERL: 100k DPS KEKW
[5:15:12] pavepawns: u can skip all the adds before mana
[5:15:14] Gerdubus: yep, you only need 1 spider before mana dev too
[5:15:26] soshiecho: Boomer taking a nap typical
[5:15:30] Banjo586: this is a nasty pull
[5:15:34] unc0de: inc bombs
[5:15:36] Nico_vdM: I remember shroud and skystep potions were used
[5:15:40] hlachezarov: Its not that overtuned just people don’t know mechanics. Easily doable on 15/16 keys
[5:15:41] kappaday23: Keepo
[5:15:44] LearnedSomething: swing low
[5:15:48] LearnedSomething: sweet chariot
[5:15:57] yuca247n: yea i heard kara not tuned right
[5:16:01] Mojohusk: For someone who's never done mythic plus - is that an addon or does the game automatically show you these stats on the run?
[5:16:02] lovemymage: iron docks is easy too
[5:16:03] Contendedlemon: they need to give it the gambit and streets treatment
[5:16:08] Shattermare: @ebanievd It’s overtuned
[5:16:13] unc0de: iron docks is a joke
[5:16:22] Banjo586: last boss in grimrail and both karas are the outliers, the others are fine
[5:16:22] PvtHudson093: I will say it again, Junkyard felt like going home
[5:16:26] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  i think they are still tuned for the legion artifacts m legos imo
[5:16:31] SyRr82: why do you want easy content
[5:16:38] nvnto: probably didnt soak
[5:16:38] unc0de: ive run 15 upper and its been ez if everyone knows it....lower on the other hand.....i spent 1.5 hours in
[5:16:45] iamWaritself: I still dont run Gambit or Streets since I never got to do the pathing...
[5:16:48] Contendedlemon: soak the green balls @Towelliee
[5:16:48] lovemymage: soak orbs
[5:16:49] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  dude we finished a +13 gmabit in 13 minutes today lmao it's insane
[5:16:51] redshift_nl: easy and doable for the majority of people is a difference
[5:16:57] nvnto: need to soak the fel orbs or they explode
[5:17:01] nvnto: iirc
[5:17:01] doomkry: yeah first two weeks of tazavesh were kinda tuned a bit over
[5:17:13] nvnto: cheers
[5:17:16] Mojohusk: Skål!
[5:17:17] Shattermare: @syrr82 Content that’s not easy is currently designed to be a waste of time
[5:17:19] Mans0025: SKÅÅL
[5:17:22] CGd0c: GT here
[5:17:22] nvnto: prost
[5:17:24] CGd0c: skål
[5:17:25] Day_Walker78: Skål
[5:17:35] Nicstar1007: is Towelliee drunk?
[5:17:49] LearnedSomething: doesn't seem drunk
[5:17:52] LearnedSomething: bit early in the day too
[5:17:59] hlachezarov: Idk why people expect 15 to be free loot piñata and don’t watch a single guide then complain until its nerfed
[5:18:02] watpuppy: I'd rather something be released overtuned than undertuned
[5:18:05] SlithTheSivak: this was when Eldenring was out so its like they had GITGUD stuck in their brains
[5:18:09] Drmmrtnt: kills king
[5:18:11] BullDevil: knights
[5:18:13] Xetter: Catering to the 1% as usual mate :)
[5:18:14] Nico_vdM: Blizzard HATES pulling the ripcord
[5:18:15] unc0de: bishops and knights
[5:18:16] BullDevil: kill knights to debuff king
[5:18:20] Banjo586: they probably rather nerf a dungeon a lot than buff it a lot in the first week
[5:18:24] K4ykay: they're just Mr. Burns'ing saying "Excellent" when they release it too
[5:18:30] FezzikGG: kill knight then hit king during stun phase. rinse and repeat
[5:18:35] Fugazi811: kill one mob then focus boss, repeat
[5:18:36] ArcaneMaki: Yes thing is people keeps playing (and paying) while they tweak it back.
[5:18:43] 79rockbottom: Kill the Knight, lower health then rest
[5:18:48] BlewGamingGroup: they dont trust people that have been playing the game for 15+ years to know when something is overtuned or not ... get gooder
[5:19:00] jarilrpg: @ebanievd i think the problem is that some keys are vastly easier than others at the same key level currently, all 15 level keys should feel about the same
[5:19:07] SaimBoo: yes
[5:19:08] unc0de: yep

[5:22:56] Dagomarus: The bullshittery aside, its a good looking dungeon
[5:23:02] Keyastaron_: i tried soloing this boss in m0 and it just killed me bc i pushed him to fast
[5:23:08] nvnto: how do u see which side he beams?
[5:23:24] LearnedSomething: I mean this is a pretty epic dungeon boss
[5:23:39] Dagomarus: Hes a big eye, just dont be where hes looking @nvnto
[5:23:54] Shattermare: Not overtuned lul
[5:24:35] RocketMan23: there are 3 debuffs in this phase
[5:25:02] nvnto: @Dagomarus assumed he's looking down the middle cause it's so subtle. thanks LULW
[5:25:14] HighThereBud: Lol
[5:25:19] raven_xii: LuL
[5:25:25] RocketMan23: they are going to nerf the shit out of kara

[5:25:27] PvtHudson093: they already hotfixed it once this week
[5:25:38] zenkodac: i mean 2 people got hit by disintegrate right down the middle XD
[5:25:44] LearnedSomething: the trash in lower is the real issue :)
[5:25:58] Shattermare: They love trolling. Like how they trolling by overtuning the Mage Tower. Lol
[5:26:04] FezzikGG: @shytam For real
[5:26:11] Banjo586: they gotta remove some enemy forces in lower kara, it's a bit of a slog
[5:26:29] Dagomarus: Yeah if you want a easy 15, best thing to do is tazavesh streets
[5:26:37] nvnto: imagine being a paladin with 1 steed charge Kappa
[5:26:51] HkaemPoV: Did +20 street. Super mega easy
[5:26:52] Pukutak: what are keys and what are the numbers
[5:27:00] PvtHudson093: https://www.wowhead.com/news/shadowlands-season-4-hotfixes-for-august-3-2022-maiden-of-virtue-nerf-shrouded-328167
[5:27:05] MessyZerg: lower kara runback is brutal
[5:27:27] Fugazi811: junkyard was fine
[5:27:31] DreamSweet: xD
[5:27:32] PvtHudson093: Opera Hall: Westfall Story Fixed an issue that would cause the encounter to prematurely end if either Toe Knee or Mrrgria were defeated before the other. Fixed an issue where Shoreline Tidespeakers could continue casting after being defeated. Maiden of Virtue Holy Bulwark absorb reduced by 20%. Attumen the Huntsman Improved the visual clarity on Intangible Presence.
[5:27:32] gelimarr: I'm full on preparing for DF
[5:27:37] nvnto: think junkyard keys were even 2 higher than everything else during bfa
[5:27:38] Shattermare: Upper is more overtuned than lower I think
[5:27:38] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  workshop is piss easy as well as junkyard
[5:27:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[5:27:39] Zippaya: dont do it for content :D
[5:27:53] TheBroCrow: do it for the gram
[5:27:56] BullDevil: lower kara higher keys without comms is just ass right now
[5:27:58] zenkodac: lower wasnt that bad, i had a hrder time with last boss of grimrail then lower
[5:28:04] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee at workshop ppl needs to kill  the plant at 3rd boss adn that's basically it
[5:28:32] Dagomarus: Karazhan just has too many mechanics, and dps are like “whats a mechanic Kappa “
[5:28:51] MarquisLek: just got shackled ur'zul on first try
[5:28:57] gelimarr: true
[5:29:04] LearnedSomething: it was amazing
[5:29:08] LeBigNose: :O
[5:29:10] LearnedSomething: I wish we were still legion now
[5:29:11] fistofnature: then they should at the very least watch a video before joinging a +15
[5:29:14] Daarksyde: yep, that was me
[5:29:20] Shattermare: Legion was only good because of the end. The start was really really bad
[5:29:21] Daarksyde: hated that i missed Legion :(
[5:29:37] rhonmexico: Agree, legion was awesome
[5:29:38] Fugazi811: theses are the OG keys
[5:29:40] MedicineMan: ^ same
[5:29:42] freexdk: that was me i switched to rift there
[5:29:43] DrDragane: Kara for m+ was also about two years into the expo
[5:29:44] SensationalBanana: Same with those missing out on MoP.
[5:29:48] OceanManCarter: legion was so damn good
[5:29:56] ErkTheMighty: @Towelliee what do you use to show your stats in the top-left of the screen?
[5:29:57] gelimarr: MoP is best expac
[5:29:59] IronWishfull: personally hated legion , ranks one of my worst expacs
[5:30:05] Snabido: Its a fair perspective to have
[5:30:06] Shattermare: I think MoP was the best
[5:30:06] hlachezarov: Because people can’t be bothered to watch a 5min guide and expect to faceroll the key LUL
[5:30:08] PatchesMcPatch: legion was the bomb
[5:30:12] Dagomarus: I skipped karazhan, but i watched a video, it was fine apart from this area with the fel bats, only wipe we had
[5:30:17] luxumdoesstuff: Legion and Mists were the best expansions in WoW
[5:30:19] Thoreya: me too man
[5:30:21] ArcaneMaki: Legion was amazing indeed.
[5:30:21] Fugazi811: Legion was so fun all the way through
[5:30:29] Thoreya: i came from OSRS before wow in 07. i was born a grinder
[5:30:32] Tirony: same
[5:30:35] MedicineMan: BFA got more hate than it deserved
[5:30:42] LearnedSomething: between the meta achievements, the secrets, the professions overhaul, the class fantasy of order halls, and the power trip of artifact weapons
[5:30:42] Ziggy_Da_Wizard: im one of those people who also enjoyed BFA and was my most played
[5:30:48] LearnedSomething: it was a glorious time to be a wow player
[5:30:53] PvtHudson093: I miss BFA
[5:30:56] DreamSweet: Legion was a ton of fun
[5:31:02] hemoshima92: Legion was amazing
[5:31:06] CaptReddBeard: @Thoreya bro that osrs life will prepare you for grinding
[5:31:06] nc716: BFA lasted the longest
[5:31:06] BlewGamingGroup: legion was more alt friendly as well
[5:31:07] stepdrag: i came in at 8.2 and enjoyed it
[5:31:10] Zippaya: So I'm not alone actualy liked BFA
[5:31:11] Banjo586: bfa got just enough hate, islands flopped, warfronts flopped, systems flopped
[5:31:12] Ziggy_Da_Wizard: the systems in BFA were nothing as bad as Shadowlands
[5:31:13] im_capy: Same, BFA HoA grind was crazy at the start, and the flying grind
[5:31:13] MedicineMan: Frost mage BFA is life
[5:31:16] FezzikGG: Getting the right corruption made it a blast though haha
[5:31:21] nvnto: Personally was glad BfA was over.
[5:31:27] Holysal: @MedicineMan azerite being a failed system made it bad
[5:31:40] Thoreya: @CaptReddBeard i had many sleepless nights grinding fishing, woodcutting, ranged, all that shit LUL
[5:31:43] zenkodac: yea farming essences was horrible coming late into bfa
[5:31:43] TheItalianStallion321: warfronts were such a pushover...my god
[5:31:47] Ziggy_Da_Wizard: i tried coming back at the last patch of BFA with the corruption system it was impossible lol
[5:31:51] SmallzzIV: I still enjoy leveling through legion and thats like 5% of the full experience
[5:31:51] Shattermare: MoP, TBC, Wrath, Legion, Cataclysm, WoD, BFA, Shadowlands
[5:31:54] Fugazi811: I loved Corruption
[5:31:57] Voidheim: Corruptions were fun
[5:31:59] Arms_Warrior: TD corruption Kreygasm
[5:32:03] DeanoTV: corruption was amazing TD Kreygasm
[5:32:04] xhaven: loved warfronts however
[5:32:05] Dagomarus: That was definately the worst part of legion and bfa, it was so intimidating to come back in the later seasons
[5:32:05] TheItalianStallion321: just trying to get corruptions sucked. once you had it. you fuckin loved it
[5:32:09] doomkry: bfa was good systems but bad execution
[5:32:17] im_capy: takes 2 mins to get a group for islands still, lots to farm
[5:32:26] BullDevil: I've tanked upper a few times and haven't gotten it yet... maybe its a monk bug? IDK
[5:32:36] CaptReddBeard: @Thoreya you damn right man some of the best times i ever had was playing rs. i still play from time to time. grind a month put it away for a year lol
[5:32:37] SupAngrytroll: Twilight devastation i miss
[5:32:41] Dagomarus: Yeah i definately think you shouldnt be getting that
[5:32:42] MedicineMan: @MedicineMan I didn't mind it that much.
[5:32:44] Banjo586: well you remember the part where you had all your corruption and max cloak, you dont remember the weekly grinds and visions farm doing the same thing forever
[5:32:45] Reinkaos999: is this timewalk?
[5:32:57] BullDevil: its always middle
[5:33:08] MedicineMan: @Reinkaos999 M+
