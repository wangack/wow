[2:52:35] 1OWAMAN: it was the only way they could nerf spy basically
[2:53:07] Hyelander_: honorspy?
[2:53:22] 1OWAMAN: spy is different
[2:53:31] 1OWAMAN: it's the one that tracks close enemies
[2:53:36] Hyelander_: oh ok

[3:39:59] GoodlifeHS: Eye for Ele is pog
[3:40:01] hamitbe: u will regret melee one
[3:40:01] Kwixz: @OzHalleron its the spice of life
[3:40:02] MurderZOne: if you wanted spel shaman why you took orc and not tauren ?
[3:40:04] bigsugg11: spell what u thinking
[3:40:16] BaronKendrick: god bless you swifty
[3:40:17] hamitbe: eye 100%
[3:40:17] iampazkid: just go tank shammy
[3:40:33] OzHalleron: choose it and buff everyone lol
[3:40:35] streetsensei: you will replace blackhands faster thans eye i think
[3:40:40] skepteezy: Yea Eye is the best choice -- you only use blackhands in enhancement pvp
[3:40:42] iampazkid: lol :)
[3:40:49] Humek456: Tank confirmed
[3:41:01] djmilesto: swifty dropping rend? everyone log on

[3:41:20] GoodlifeHS: HoJ > BhB
[3:41:26] skepteezy: 2% spell crit trinket only in Naxx other than Eye of the Beast
[3:41:30] streetsensei: get eye
[3:41:39] lordofthePIES314: yeah go eye
[3:41:39] OzHalleron: log on in 10 mins when swifty finally chooses
[3:41:41] wymsly: eye of the beast is the way to go
[3:41:43] MurderZOne: for the raid let`s go
[3:41:45] Kwixz: crits nice but if your crits high enough and you have a windfury with you id go hoj
[3:42:11] Kwixz: take the eye lol
[3:42:22] LazyPaladin2: What do you do more in a fight? Hit melee or shock?
[3:42:30] iampazkid: would it be worth it to use it as enhancement to get more crits from shocks?
[3:42:31] Bewildfire: Eye-eye.
[3:42:35] puna90: trinket shaman bwl class is soooo STRONG
[3:42:44] lordofthePIES314: yeah go eye
[3:42:45] skepteezy: 2% Spell Crit trinket in Naxx is Eye of Diminution -- drops off Thaddius @Swifty
[3:42:50] Astrosparkle: You always have pvp trinket and HoJ is arguably as good or better than BHB. I'd just go Eye.
[3:42:56] skepteezy: yea go eye
[3:43:00] Wazzyl: LUL
[3:43:14] OzHalleron: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 I swear to jeebus choose something or I will log in, lvl to 60 and slappa you lol

[3:43:38] andrei_dls: For this season Eye for Healing is best :)
[3:43:39] Kwixz: LUL
[3:43:43] OzHalleron: LUL
[3:43:43] skepteezy: you will replace eye with zhc/bwl shaman trinket/nef tear though -- but eye is still better than melee crit trinket
[3:43:44] Humek456: eye or unfollow Kappa
[3:43:45] hamitbe: E y e of the S w i f t y
