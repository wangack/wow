[1:25:47] Fanatilt: Real and true!

[1:46:01] dorki: healers will say it's healers that get punished
[1:46:02] yiannisjk: Because tanks know you're gonna pad the hell out of a big pull and bolster a mob and kill the tank, while if he pulls smaller because of this, you're probably gonna whine that the pull is too small
[1:46:08] moewe11: @Jeff_dd for me its realy fun to see ppl get oneshot by a 17 bolster stacks add xD
[1:46:21] B3nbu: It's a shit affix

[1:46:59] Jeff_dd: or prock my cheat
[1:47:04] RaxxFPS: Bolstering is unfun for tank and requires to much brain for the rest of the group
[1:47:07] DogShitPaladin: " im not gonna pull the bear this pack guys" in DHT, the DPS cry, you pull the bear in open pull, it bolsters and kills 10 times

[3:12:21] back_again_paradar: Hello mr streamer. Long time viewer here. I've recently seen a decline in hair cells on your head. I thought to myself that it might because you have turned 30 and is old now. But I did my research and it shows only 25% of men which are 30 years old are bald. So I have made a conclussion. The conclussion is it might be the gameplay stressing you causing you to lose hair. I know World of Warcraft can be stressing at times, so I would recommend you to step down and farm tmog, more your style :)
[3:12:24] ibracohiba: i feel so stupid when i tank on my pala.. litterally nothing you can stop, brh is pure pain

[3:25:30] B3nbu: you've been winning too much YEP
[3:25:43] florpie_: it kinda depends aswell how much are you losing with not streaming vs not gaurenteed firsts anymore
[3:25:48] Akyran: yeah its just not special for you anymore i guess
[3:25:59] jenny_yellow: You have to either love winning or hate losing.
[3:26:01] back_again_paradar: @DogShitPaladin honey moon period we can call it, then real life hits, and bills come in
[3:26:03] arxidaki123: back in bfa there was actual competition tho and it wasnt boring for you
[3:26:14] Flippaur: just stream practice u are gonna win anyway
[3:26:14] purplejesusss: maybe if you lose this one you will get the ignite stacks back
[3:26:17] vedee: streaming is the bird in the hand instead of two in the bush
[3:26:36] Linodinosaur: @Naowh quick question what are the "taunt boss" in red text for on fyrakk Susge just did a fyrakk boost and they showed up after i updated
[3:26:37] Akyran: i make more money by just working a normal job Kappa
[3:26:49] ui_slash: ui_slash subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! Yo handsome
[3:27:00] timmytales: Can you show your overall damage breakdown
[3:27:00] yesman297: price pool needs to be higher
[3:27:02] DustFlap: winning MDI will bump up viewers when it's over
[3:27:03] LightdarkGaming: bigger the pool, better the competition
[3:27:10] cablamo1: yeah but it's also do you need to practice so much if you win anyway
[3:27:14] Fegir: does any1 know if i can still loot the legendary from hc raid if i cleared normal in the same week?
[3:27:18] Verothe3rd: not streaming practice is a decision that prioritizes winning, right?
[3:27:19] back_again_paradar: Wow will be the next game blizzard kill esports in KEKW they have done with every other title so far
[3:27:21] rpgonlyforme: i do think the prize pools could go up

[3:27:32] B3nbu: @Linodinosaur it tells you to taunt the boss YEP
[3:27:47] rpgonlyforme: like, 20k per person for winning the whole thing isn't amazing money
[3:27:54] oshide: but winning is mdi is helping your twitch career i think?
[3:27:55] florpie_: growing up and having other prio's in life than just games, not weird tbh
[3:27:56] Linodinosaur: Smadge @B3nbu
[3:28:07] back_again_paradar: @rpgonlyforme it was 30k per team so split it 5 ways and it's before tax
[3:28:23] Verothe3rd: if you placed less significance on winning, you could make more money and maintain healthier stream performance maybe
[3:28:44] da_gud: @Fegir yeah you can do it that way, start with hc go normal and then lfr if u want too
[3:28:48] iwibsy: iwibsy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:28:49] rpgonlyforme: i dont' think it is 30k.  the old post said the global finals prize fund is 200k, i just assumed about half went to the winner
[3:29:12] oshide: winning will make you more "famous" = more viewers in the future?
[3:29:44] Qwasty: what about fun?
[3:29:47] xaamu: Surely that 7th title will double your average viewers YEP
[3:29:47] vedee: most of the teams invest hundreds of hours without any payback. thats dedication
[3:29:50] elhanchoow: the fame chose u
[3:29:50] rpgonlyforme: definitely has a feedback loop tho.  if you are at the top of the game, people still gonna watch you
[3:29:53] PhysicsHaiku: I mean y'all have won 6 in a row, one more won't change the "fame" I'd say
[3:29:56] yesman297: spark
[3:30:02] B3nbu: more ppl will come in and complain how much exploits you use KEKW
[3:30:05] sampalampaa: U got fat that why u are un motiwated
[3:30:06] florpie_: i feel like echo is pretty cemented in the scene them winning another cup will not drive more long term vieuwership i think
[3:30:09] BigKoala1: BigKoala1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[3:30:09] back_again_paradar: The question is: how many new viewers come in from MDI KEKW
[3:30:14] samsamshow: you need to lose to re ignite
[3:30:15] brobashov: go back to working on the docks for 6months, and see how you feel after that
[3:30:37] florpie_: when you guys streamed tgp practice in shadowlands it was alot of fun
[3:30:47] sampalampaa: You got fat thats why you are unmotivated
[3:30:51] da_gud: TGP
[3:30:51] alexlaprise: tgp
[3:30:52] back_again_paradar: let ChatGPT make a route 5Head
[3:30:52] cablamo1: This is just the world 1st race all over again
[3:30:53] rpgonlyforme: well, you can stream parts of practice and keep some of the super secret tech off stream
[3:31:11] captainpetson: tgp, wasn't it when jpc joined?
[3:31:18] xDaruis: How about uploading practice to youtube? Can't you get some money from yt vids, after mdi?
[3:31:26] Gholir: Just return to Echo guild man. You're the best
[3:31:53] B3nbu: can still practice on live servers YEP
[3:32:11] Gholir: Gholir subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Thank you for the amazing content. Hope you return to Echo soon
[3:32:13] rpgonlyforme: the real question, are you gonna raid cata?  kill some ragnaros?
[3:32:27] B3nbu: lots of banter goes on during practice
[3:32:28] nikonshi: imho the MDI is a kinda boring event nowadays. every team plays the almost exact same comp. YES i know its all about speed and optimizing strats ....
[3:32:36] donnynorthcutt: do you think bringing back LAN would bring energy back to MDI / TGP
[3:33:00] nikonshi: but maybe it would be fun to set classes as well for every dungeon :D
[3:33:01] ghenesis_: Is there going to be TGP in s3?
[3:33:08] Skrewdriv3r: @nikonshi we saw alot of variety these 2 weeks ? :P
[3:33:28] Xantoszz: The prize pool for the MDI doesn't seem high enough for all the effort people put into it
[3:33:28] lillestoltv: world first 80 prep is also in summer ;)
[3:34:05] rpgonlyforme: i think grand prize for the winning team should be like 250k
[3:34:10] rpgonlyforme: 50k per player
[3:34:53] Kerzor1996: didnt they at some point add a toy to increase the prize pool? why dont they do that anymore?
[3:34:56] StreamElements: Follow my Social Medias! Instagram.com/naowh | Twitter.com/naowhxd | Youtube.com/naowhgaming
[3:35:37] Bossitron: 12k last year for 5+6th.

[3:35:43] Elaisor1605: Elaisor1605 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! RET POWER
[3:35:43] lillestoltv: @Kerzor1996 they dont need to add stuff like that when they're a billion dollar company, figure out how to make it good and interesting and it will fix itself
[3:36:39] Bossitron: liquidpedia
[3:36:40] kirachyy: !ui

[3:37:16] Kerzor1996: @lillestoltv i dont see any downside if the money goes to the teams.
[3:37:27] brobashov: I dont really see how working a normal job is even compaird to that prize money? how many hours are we talking about for MDI?
[3:37:29] Bossitron: https://liquipedia.net/worldofwarcraft/MDI/2024/Finals
[3:38:13] Bossitron: 50% less than 2023
[3:38:22] lillestoltv: @Kerzor1996 that is true, but they shouldn't rely on stuff like that when they're a billion dollar company, it's their job to fix it and not the consumer
[3:38:34] daabzii: wait, dont u each get like 40k?
[3:38:42] Xantoszz: The current model payouts would work better if they had M+ events more frequently, but not for how it currently is
[3:39:03] da_gud: is this $ or swe?
[3:39:08] antediem147: antediem147 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 33 month streak! 
[3:39:17] daabzii: $

[3:39:56] ripbossqt: goes echo provide bonus for win?
[3:40:02] oceansetups: that's not that much if u are a freelancer streamer
[3:40:06] lillestoltv: $13/hr for being 4th team in the world KEKW
[3:40:06] vedee: less than minimum wage
[3:40:11] oceansetups: taxes, insurances suck
[3:40:14] Bossitron: S1 had 50% higher prize pools, not sure why its so much less
[3:40:23] vedee: only makes somewhat sense if youre going to school and love practicing mdi
[3:40:28] Xantoszz: That's only accounting for time during the event, that doesn't account for all the practice it takes
[3:40:43] pokemongonicolai: 13$ an hour is my hourly pay SeemsGood
[3:40:44] ripbossqt: ya but im sure echo gives a bonus if you win MDI for the guild.
[3:40:59] cablamo1: dont you practice more because they added an entire other event?
[3:41:05] zizzup: 300 x 5
