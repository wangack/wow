[1:25:12] Kaacia: @toneezzy Respec is so cheap I don't see the issue with respeccing when you need.
[1:25:30] desmoli: rogue just feels expensive for PvP with blind powder and tea  even not min-maxing just as ‘standard’
[1:26:00] Kaacia: I was just commenting on someone saying they are locked to healing gnomer :)
[1:26:30] h1bears: especially if you don’t have a trainer to respec in iron forge
[1:26:36] ruptip: @desmoli you dont need tea for standard rogue PvP play
[1:26:42] ruptip: Powder cheap
[1:27:10] wutfacesz: I think I lost gold crafting the blue one LUL

[1:30:19] Mystiggo: monkaGIGA
[1:30:32] h1bears: we’ve been doing a strat for this boss where only 2 people have to move. makes it a lot simpler
[1:31:11] arcane0mage: Hi Hydra hydraBee hydraLove , hi chat , hi mods
[1:31:29] Mystiggo: I hate that people have just accepted the 2 groups moving strat for this instead of doing 2 parallel groups
[1:31:37] Mystiggo: Like the first week scuff strat is just the meta for this now
[1:31:49] h1bears: 2 parallel groups is sooooo easy
[1:32:27] h1bears: then 1 person from each group moves out and in. everyone else stays still unless they get the charge
[1:32:27] Lylitzz: If i'm running blue staff from here, shoulders from BFD and stamina trinket and I have 2 soft res per raid, which of the three items between dagger, trinket and shoulders shall I give up?
[1:32:32] Landon_MDL: hydraa
[1:32:32] Lylitzz: Sorry if it's a bit confusing
[1:32:35] gustav178: I hope they make the raids harder, i wiped 4 times tot first run. Since then no wipes at all
[1:32:36] Landon_MDL: show current gear pls?
[1:32:41] Mystiggo: and you try to convince pugs to do it the easy way and they're like "nah let's not get fancy here"
[1:32:41] Lylitzz: Just want to try and prioritise biggest upgrades
[1:32:53] r0nin_xd: @UnoTV_ its an option in the add on classic aura durations, however hydra has a gate kept version of it that highlights the buffs like the spellstealable aura in tbc and wrath
[1:33:23] Landon_MDL: you can take 2 before it resets if you click again quickly
[1:33:23] h1bears: @mystiggo the one I pugged was the same. they refused to listen to anything lol
[1:33:36] r0nin_xd: @UnoTV_ took me awhile to figure it out, the best you can get is just to turn the setting on, and calll it a day, unless you know how to custom script the aura highlights.
[1:34:13] Lylitzz: Sorry hahaha
[1:34:24] UnoTV_: Heyy, I tried to find the addon that you use for enemy frame buffs but its not on your addon video, would u care to share?  :D
