[0:08:05] zachgamegodx: maybe time dial cdr
[0:08:09] stickydubz: what if you tried the reduced cd on time dialation when you cast essence spells?
[0:08:16] wackpoetic: Spiritual Clarity, works really well with Flow State
[0:08:47] wackpoetic: Faster Spiritbloom CD means more Flow State uptime, means more casts, etc
[0:09:30] wackpoetic: you can drop the 2 stacks of Essence Bloom for that too
[0:09:45] wackpoetic: Esssence Burst* or w/e

[0:17:31] zachgamegodx: you don’t like the life force mender build?
[0:17:56] wackpoetic: too many points IMO. Makes your Living Flames hit like double, but you overheal a ton anyway
[0:18:10] wackpoetic: good for offense, but you have to give up so much utility for it
[0:18:32] wackpoetic: the dam is huge if you have haste though

[0:40:17] nikthevoker: "1 heal" LUL
[0:40:17] vonos: gg ven, warlock couldnt take it :/
[0:40:18] Rmxdlol: I actually dont know what that was
[0:40:31] ellisrainy: hahaha
[0:40:38] itschen: i knew it
[0:40:45] wackpoetic: I swear DK lobbies are good for Pres and Warlock lobbies are bad
[0:40:52] vonos: That lock made me lose too, he took gate and outranged me lol.
[0:41:15] Rmxdlol: I swear pres is struggle bus trying to heal casters even if theyre good
[0:41:31] Rmxdlol: i hate pres as mage
[0:41:43] Damitongo: Warriooooooooor
[0:42:03] nikthevoker: make sure to portal and run AWAY from heals
[0:42:11] malvarcla: what if they just put their port on the dk instead?
[0:42:13] dvoraklol: i do that then run in line of my haeler and get gripped LUL
[0:42:17] wackpoetic: Ya I've had too many games where a lock Ports out with Time Dilation DoT at low HP and never comes back into LOS

[0:42:35] wackpoetic: and I'm just screaming at my screen to let me heal him

[0:42:48] yesterday_potato: rewind does nothing
[0:42:57] Ameratzu: dam what a good track
[0:42:58] yesterday_potato: like not even a hyperbole
[0:42:59] wackpoetic: Rewind only does something if you have Lifebind on the whole team too
[0:43:11] theookerinaoftime: Wtf is kick
[0:43:14] wackpoetic: maybe they make it that Rewind applies Lifebind as well and it's fixed
[0:43:15] YoMamaSoFine69: do you heal alot with flame?
[0:43:43] yesterday_potato: The pvp talent that purges drives me nuts on druid
[0:44:06] Sniffity: @venruki I was watching your video on how WoW has gotten too complicated... I find myself in a very similar situation, where the complexity has really put me off playing, this despite playing since Cataclysm D: I was wondering, are there any classes you might recommend that have a slow skill floor and high skill ceiling? Something that is easy to pick up, but rewarding to master? Thank you mate!
[0:44:22] nikthevoker: itf it got 100% buff it wouldnt be enough
[0:44:22] Hamselv007: I saw a video from you, on youtube watching wowhead, it said 10/20% with grace period - however its just 15% - or did it just been 20% but now equals to 15%?
[0:44:26] wackpoetic: Devoker

[1:05:20] Cerion17: i had similar lobby today it tilted me, i didnt play my healer after that
[1:05:25] Itankarenas: ret confirmed op
[1:05:41] Taevenx: @Itankarenas it dun been
[1:05:55] NozakGaming: ruki after dark is my fav.
[1:07:50] Nateypww: I want to thank you for everything you’ve done in the world of Warcraft community. I always loved playing mage and got better throughout the years of watching the best in the world and you’re definitely included in that conversation keep making your content and staying up baby!
[1:08:30] shinydunsparce: ret bubble a teamate challenge - impossible
[1:08:39] Hamselv007: You should consider getting the bigger living flame, do your rotation - and after you use dream breath - echo living flame, it heals for alot :)
[1:08:41] Hamrock77: silenced the war there..?
[1:08:48] diperna99: are you going to compete in AWC?
[1:08:55] Hamselv007: and its a fast cast
[1:09:06] wodie225: What NamePlate addon do you use dude? Plater?
[1:09:09] Hamselv007: ahh
[1:10:18] psykuu: I don't wanna sound like a douche. But you forgot quite a bit to use stasis, not that it's a massive difference but it caught my attention
[1:10:21] psychic241: safe to say evoker buffs are underwhelming lol
[1:11:16] psykuu: was up for the last minute or so from last arena
[1:11:30] NozakGaming: why are you ooming before disc priest? I thought disc priest was supposed to be the aggro win before damp healer. seems weird to me.
[1:11:46] NozakGaming: seems like evoker needs mana buff or something if theyre ooming before priest
[1:12:12] Taevenx: is that overall healing/dam or segment?
[1:12:28] psykuu: I getting quite dependent of addons, not sure I like it makes me think less about the game
[1:12:31] Runfatboy: @nozakgaming that priest had mind bender spec
[1:12:44] rank1playerlul: @venruki i miss the legend named neilyo =[. i know u do to.
[1:12:48] IamWalnuts: ven you would look really good with a mullet

[1:14:21] seaent: lmfao hilarious reaction to that burst

[1:18:17] kreyzy8: this lobby is a fiesta LUL
[1:18:34] organicsungrown: the ww is pumpin
[1:19:01] Cerion17: catJAM
[1:19:27] cdewx: is bnet having issues? my wow is updating so slow its crazy
[1:19:40] Nateypww: do you think pres evoker would be too powerful if their disintegrate acted like a FW and nerfed a couple other spells?
[1:19:58] dprims8: did any healers get buffed or nerfed?
[1:20:07] kashmoney31: death log for ele?
[1:20:10] kashmoney31: he got deleted
[1:20:11] organicsungrown: @cdewx mine just did that too
[1:20:20] Aroty: mine was also really slow
[1:20:27] Aroty: and the mailboxes in Valdrakken are missing
[1:20:31] theronpaul: evoker looks so op after matches but ur cds are poop it looks like LUL i would be pissed playing and seeing my teammates die doing 250k hps
[1:21:07] psykuu: @cdewx I think so but not for everyone, might be IP specific. Had a friend with problems today as well
[1:21:38] organicsungrown: is this the one and only @theronpaul
[1:21:49] organicsungrown: the hpal from solo ahuffle
[1:22:31] theronpaul: I am one of those things yeah :D
[1:22:33] Ameratzu: no netherwalk
[1:22:35] kashmoney31: lol no nether and no burrow
[1:22:41] psychic241: these r 2100 dps, they not gonna help u lol
[1:22:43] organicsungrown: lol
[1:22:46] kreyzy8: the shaman did burrow
[1:22:59] cdewx: been updating for 10 mins and stuck at 0% KEKW
[1:23:15] kashmoney31: @kreyzy8 little late though
[1:23:29] kashmoney31: game's lost by then if healer is trading 2-3 CDs when sham could have traded 1
[1:23:43] kreyzy8: yeah he got leg swept > shockwave > dragon stun with no trinket
[1:24:34] psykuu: I agree
[1:24:46] Itankarenas: it's possible to do everything right and still lose
[1:25:04] organicsungrown: @cdewx lame
[1:25:15] NozakGaming: Thats what sucks about shuffle. You can only control so much.
[1:25:19] psykuu: What do you think of fire breath purge into dragon? In theory should be good no?
[1:25:19] organicsungrown: @cdewx mine took a while but it did it
[1:25:29] gfknw: whats the best ehalers for solo rn ?
[1:25:43] yesterday_potato: So when they unlock conq can we then buy boa tokens for conq on alts?
[1:25:52] rank1playerlul: dragonflight= best expansion?
[1:26:17] joyrex_j9: I've never played more arena since they added shuffle
[1:26:35] joyrex_j9: group finder always turned me off so I'd just quit when I didn't have friends to play with
[1:26:36] B_Kal: people hate on it, but when you really compare it, DF pvp has been pretty dang good outside of the solo queue time issuie
[1:26:46] yesterday_potato: kinda what my wifes like
[1:27:02] Magottx: Last lift day before big day. Got down to 182 from 190 but still put up 225 for 23.  Time to carb up for 2 days
[1:27:21] leeka: @yesterday_potato BOA boxes for alts with random conquest gear
[1:27:48] healhut: if your luck is like mine allll crit/vers rolls
[1:28:14] Taevenx: In Leeka We Trust <3
[1:28:16] Magottx: Vert went from 37 to 40 too in last month. So things looking good. Just hope my hands are on point
[1:29:37] Magottx: Wow keeps them nimble tho right
[1:29:52] psykuu: clean
[1:30:07] theronpaul: how many spellschools presvokers have to cast from? just 2?
[1:30:24] wackpoetic: Magottx could you dunk on DrDisrespect?
[1:30:36] theronpaul: that's pretty kool
[1:30:55] rank1playerlul: @wackpoetic lol wtf
[1:31:11] wackpoetic: bro he's got a 38 inch vertical leap
[1:31:11] Magottx: lol idk shoot on him but yea I can dunk. I’m only 5’9 tho so it’s difficult
[1:31:22] rank1playerlul: Perception... hide it out.
[1:31:25] Magottx: About*
[1:31:39] tray89: Hey Ven,, what would you say is meta for mellee rn?>
[1:31:46] wackpoetic: what do you do to work out your vert? deadlift?

[2:23:50] itz_killjoy: doesn't it increase damage u take too?
[2:24:04] DangerousDtv: but thats not really what fury is about its about its burst windows
[2:24:20] tikdoks: the FW is probably giving him a 10% damage buff
[2:24:35] skydog70: he was also cleaving the whole time no?
[2:24:42] shinydunsparce: deathwish into spirit link just gets your healers blasted
