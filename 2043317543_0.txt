[2:41:19] skeeveert: what realm is that guy on
[2:41:21] Joshi402: Bar doesnt change
[2:41:24] xHeythemops: Stealth bar
[2:41:27] br187x: true
[2:41:28] br187x: or cloak
[2:41:33] roxtempo: He can simply randomly press disarm
[2:41:35] kleszczudruid: macro: if in stealth sap, no stealth disarm
[2:41:37] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz he means when he is subter the bar is not changing yet cuz still in stealth
[2:41:39] bestqtmvp: may is Perfecto from Echo KappaRoss
[2:41:42] toneeshin: can also bait trinket for set up with blind no ?
[2:41:45] Metaphors: the curveball got pika
[2:41:50] waitimdesyncd: isnt that what makes it sus, that the script disarmes instant because it looks at pika cds and not because of good game knowledge which  would cheapshot
[2:41:50] Metaphors: the off script disarm
[2:41:52] Metaphors: mind fucked him
[2:41:55] toneeshin: vanish the trinket and reopen out off disarm
[2:42:06] emergence_fi: watch the movement as well he was moving like the bot shamans as well
[2:42:08] br187x: LOL
[2:42:09] wave0007: maybe he's giving tricks to the mage ?
[2:42:09] DCBen: normal
[2:42:13] Qwneer: i mean just gets pissed on
[2:42:13] br187x: damn that cloak tbh
[2:42:15] Qwneer: nothing more
[2:42:15] Cassidy38: there is nothing ?
[2:42:15] DCBen: thats a normal bait
[2:42:18] eX1stnZ_: Nothing sus
[2:42:19] Cassidy38: he got piss on casssAya
[2:42:22] DCBen: easy bait
[2:42:22] br187x: i wonder why piak didnt gouge into kidney
[2:42:26] whspe: i mean that cloak isnt weird
[2:42:27] br187x: since he had blades
[2:42:32] nalwaah974: yes
[2:42:33] DCBen: totally normal
[2:42:34] beastboyy122: you’re all maybe, maybe @whaazz
[2:42:35] eX1stnZ_: Nah it's not weird cuz vs mage to prevent a poly or something easily cloak too he thought
[2:42:35] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Whaazz and enter code: ECHO
[2:42:37] beastboyy122: Keepo
[2:42:37] DCBen: just a good player
[2:42:40] amaterashu: did mage pressed cobast?
[2:42:45] Justinky1: just got clarted
[2:42:47] aod0311x: what was the weird foot movement
[2:42:47] xHeythemops: bot would prolly instant cloak the combust
[2:42:48] lokum17: @Whaazz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTBo562hTUY&t=2s
[2:42:51] llomachenko: nah cloak is obvi cuz hes not on stun dr of course he will cloak cuz he knows the go from the mage rogue is coming
[2:42:52] drpumpxd: if he is 1600 now doesnt mean he always been 1600, maybe he was higher at some point and has basic knowledge about the game
[2:42:54] drpumpxd: so what
[2:42:56] lokum17: Watch these fking bots
[2:42:57] lemarox: its prob a pilot boost
[2:42:58] aod0311x: he glitches around after the kidney
[2:42:59] raouten: i feel there is a diffrence between u and a random rouge player <3
[2:43:04] Zuk_______: NA BRAIN
[2:43:06] ALjalladTv: cloak before kidney lights up
[2:43:06] Justinky1: he's a gigachad booster
[2:43:10] llDakaill: not a scripter
[2:43:11] toneeshin: are we actually playing goremaw kyrian now
[2:43:12] renberg31: Just concidence
[2:43:18] eX1stnZ_: Mage is under combo too so ofc he cloak worth even for the damage when the fireball starts coming
[2:43:18] ninja10545: 100% cheater
[2:43:21] llDakaill: hes just predicting
[2:43:21] Limmee_wow: no ur right
[2:43:25] DCBen: 10000% correct
[2:43:29] llDakaill: not script
[2:43:29] Vorborgs: he cloaks before kidney is out on pika - seems normal?
[2:43:31] DCBen: you are totally right
[2:43:32] br187x: ye timing diff
[2:43:34] Limmee_wow: he pressed cloak cuz he knew he couldnt restun
[2:43:35] br187x: happens a lot
[2:43:36] ardalolthe: yes what if he was being piloted?
[2:43:37] amaterashu: i think he cloaked by mistake cause mage used combastion
[2:43:37] beastboyy122: ask Jaime how the botting works
[2:43:42] sinseh7: ofc he suppose to cloak
[2:43:42] Bashy_89: its fucking whaazz playing on alt on us!!! 10000%
[2:43:44] llomachenko: Thats an obvious cloak
[2:43:45] frellerd: they disarm thing.. is weird tho.. subterfuge should keep him on same bar.. if thats the argument
[2:43:47] sind233: I dont understand the CR argument, what does that prove? Maybe he has another account or hasnt pushed t hat rogue or who teh fuck knows
[2:43:49] uncannysword: @Whaazz think you're right, i think pika is just not expecting good player at 1600 and can't process it like it was a good player playing
[2:43:52] lokum17: @beastboyy122 hahahaha gold
[2:44:00] and1spirit: i mean the step kidney happens at 0.1 sec end of disarm like perfection
[2:44:17] toucq: someone have clip jaime ?
[2:44:23] llDakaill: @frellerd thats not true tho u can have disarm in another bar
[2:44:24] Refren_: outlaw bots at least vs locks insta blade rush on ports
[2:44:29] Refren_: i assume bot would insta bladerush shadowsteps aswell
[2:44:34] Bashy_89: yea lets call jamie and ask him how it works
[2:44:42] kallesurf: blade rush is single target increase for energy reg, atleast in pve
[2:44:44] badmy__: I bet its the same guy who plays eu character Robinbanks, still not banned perma
[2:44:48] br187x: and he surely has the 3 yard talent
[2:44:53] br187x: he didnt even need itxd
[2:44:55] Dj_man: when is next AWC ?
[2:45:04] sind233: Or maybe he does it to confuse you to think he is not cheating xD
[2:45:07] sind233: kekW
[2:45:11] llomachenko: the cloak isnt bait at all to me idk
[2:45:13] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz pika is commenting this clip after that
[2:45:13] Moobot: https://www.twitch.tv/whaazz/clip/JazzyUnusualJalapenoEagleEye-idkWIYFZo54OaUnC

[2:46:22] eX1stnZ_: 1 random outlaw doing EU tryhard level shit on NA and NA calls cheat but NA so good right LUL
[2:46:28] xHeythemops: that was Jamie ?
[2:46:28] Bombasthiccc: ye i get u

[2:46:44] akswow: literally Ropz Sadge
[2:46:44] badmy__: thats not random, when you grapple and your character connects, because of server lag on his screen your char is only starting the animation, its extremely hard to calculate exact moment if the 'impact' its 99.9% some soft
[2:46:49] gfknw: if he dont cheat he should just be happy so no is wierd of u defending him
[2:46:51] DCBen: he showed some when streaming
[2:46:54] uncannysword: @eX1stnZ_ ya average 1600 EU game goes like that, cmon dont be delusional mate
[2:46:55] sind233: People who call Jamie cheater just hate shamans Kappa

[2:50:54] Recklessqt99: so if they ban someone, he can sue blizzard for checking his PC ? @Whaazz
[2:50:55] Bombasthiccc: in other games you have to sign a contract with it that they can view your software thingies
[2:51:00] Nextrkw: prolly because if u want a proper anticheat it has to run in the background permanently
[2:51:00] roxtempo: do you know about 1900 layoffs?

[2:51:26] badmy__: how do you explain that he targets mage, but spams damaging abilities on rogue @Whaazz ? he has FOCUS SINISTER STRIKE and abuses it ?
[2:51:36] Mimou_: @Whaazz your not saying he is cheating but you eluding to it is basically the same thing.
[2:51:37] thewhiteguywhoisblack: there is a new bot its untraceablr russian next lvl hacks
[2:51:38] zaigodmodex: The bot programmer even tells hes cheating
[2:51:40] Cassidy38: @Nextrkw Faceit anticheat is piss
[2:51:40] Justinky1: @VcodeXOXO yes but it's an official tournament and other tournaments take these measures to keep the integrity
[2:51:45] ardalolthe: @Whaazz pika says the jaime clip is cheat too lmao

[2:52:50] badmy__: just an occam's case, simpliest answer is most likely correct, guy is a script
[2:52:57] DCBen: bro i meld 3x hunts in a game
[2:53:02] lordelenath: shamans kicking every spell on shear CD after 0.1sec cast time are cheaters. thats just a fact

[2:57:41] VitoBambino: @lokum17 there is no “opinion” — there is only the fact of whether somebody is cheating or not. and if anything, R1 players are probably more likely to make false accusations because 1) it’s a more competitive and stressful environment and 2) egos are much bigger lmao
