[1:55:40] Shaians: The phrase “it's just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you've lost twice. There's always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.

[5:16:09] Urebaldd: Their group has always been a bit toxic, but the comments were uncalled for
[5:16:17] ubba90: he was treated the same way he treats his group constantly.
[5:16:28] UsedRuggs: He was a cunt himself though lol

[5:16:42] gretriku: he was definitely being a bit of a dick but people went way over the top with how they were talking about him
[5:16:42] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: Sounds like a fun way to spend your time playing a video game
[5:16:42] oevrit: drama has been dry so this got blown up
