[0:39:42] Affiiance: yep spamming arenas is the way to go
[0:39:44] AcidSyndicate: just make gear that you can give your alts. like main 210. give stuff alt , now alt 210
[0:40:01] Xailen: I guess getting 1800 should be cake to get them?
[0:40:06] TheUnknowing: Honestly the new loot system in theory I thought id like but as the weeks go by, i fucking hate it lol
[0:40:14] xBaDGaMinG: What’s up everybody! O/
[0:40:59] Sollice: @Towelliee Get my COVID vaccine on Wednesday. I guess you don't get SOME benefit being a healthcare worker

[0:41:49] letrickyxd: M+ loot is so bad
[0:41:50] northcub: what am I going to do with Verc
[0:41:53] MrGattz: i have a fix for the loot. took me about 10 mins to think of while taking a shit. you kill a boss, you get a token. any boss in a dungeon gives you some x amount of tokens. then, dungeons can drop nearly no loot and you can take the tokens you get a buy yourself the gear you actually want after like 5 dungeons. solved.
[0:41:58] CamYam: just tuned in, isnt pvp honor gear capped at 200 ilvl?
[0:42:20] CamYam: 200 once u unlock the renown
[0:42:22] michaelmm: M+ gearing feels really unrewarding. Struggling to want to do more than the min for the week'y chest.

[0:42:45] MOLAR305: so gatz is saying justice badges
[0:42:52] A_New_Challenger: You need a rating before you can upgrade the conquest gear
[0:43:08] MrGattz: @MOLAR305 basically, yes.

[5:33:16] Toasti0: monks have 19% armour and no cd's and lowest hp in the game

[5:38:45] brucezhu: I feel that they messed up BDK in the first week, feels like a paper. After first week it becomes much smoother. Not sure whether that's because I have more gears or they fixed some armor related issue after first week.
[5:41:12] Avinar: i didn't notice that. I don't think I've seen blood DK's period. besides leveling

[5:55:51] Wikedlyrics: then idk why that guy was saying a 10 is hard for BDK this week
[5:55:56] rios1k: I dont mind the grievous fortified is just dump

[6:30:46] iunbearable: to much vers on pvp gear
[6:30:57] sanitydrain: is this heroic?
[6:31:07] jbwow01: Some people dont wanna pvp because they dont like it? The same issue pvp players had with pve last expansion. They need to stop messing around and find a balance. Gear sucks atm!
[6:31:08] xideontv: 3 riad bosses loot bad luck protection like legion and bfa
[6:31:11] CrunkyBrewster: NOPE
[6:31:13] swordwindgaming: thing is I don't want to arena grind
[6:31:17] Getitonthelow: lmaoooo
[6:31:20] Getitonthelow: so true!!
[6:31:21] Artivicii: so satisfying slootGasm
[6:31:21] CrunkyBrewster: not to me. And im mr lfr casual filth here
[6:31:29] SpectralExa: agreed
[6:31:31] Samaron2012: plus they nerfed pve loot drops.... so yeah.
[6:31:32] Getitonthelow: downed 6 bosses and got 1 piece of loot
[6:31:33] Jigsawzz: loot and pvp busted. game is broken confirmed
[6:31:38] sanitydrain: So is this heroic or mythic?

[6:31:39] prettycvt: showing your boomer mentality rn
[6:31:40] XxExiLexX: @Towelliee arena gear should never be use for pve runs... bring back armor pen like back in the day.
[6:31:50] Avinar: I don't mind pvping but arena's are something I don't like doing. I play too many alts.
[6:31:57] CrunkyBrewster: it took me two weeks just to get ivl 170 by my loansome
[6:32:17] CrunkyBrewster: and then i discovered the pvp gear. and got it in one sitting
[6:32:17] Avinar: I got 171 on my druid alt in less than 3 days with pvp LUL
[6:32:23] CrunkyBrewster: yes
[6:32:37] CrunkyBrewster: if i had known that from the avinar it would have been a different story for me LUL
[6:32:44] Jigsawzz: @Avinar pvp > pve for Blizzard LUL
[6:32:44] Luthercorpz: I WAS HERE nb3Smile
[6:32:55] CrunkyBrewster: like i had no idea there was upgradable vender gear
[6:33:03] crixus250x: crixus250x subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! ayooooo
[6:33:12] Avinar: same here. I was even being lazy with gearing. I casually did pvp and still geared really fast
[6:33:13] chungomungus: why go to the short side LUL
[6:33:38] CrunkyBrewster: part of the problem with me was still having the World Quest gear mentality
[6:33:45] CrunkyBrewster: Yes tow LUL its nutty
[6:33:53] CrunkyBrewster: I was like this cant be right lmao
[6:34:15] Samaron2012: in general alot of things are out of wack from waht im hearing inclduing legacy stuff.
[6:34:16] Jigsawzz: fire the Blizzard employees? Did they outsource the coding to the diablo immortal folks?
[6:34:22] ThiCCboiyG: are you implying that pvp gear shouldnt be as high ilvl as pve gear?
[6:34:25] Avinar: then pvpers would say "Wtf they can pay gold to get easy 220 ilevel p2w and pver's angri"
[6:34:27] Attackroot: Doesn’t swifty have the 233 pvp weapon?
[6:34:42] CrunkyBrewster: I got a ivl 200 weapon already fgrom pvp
[6:34:51] chungomungus: 233 weapon? wtf?
[6:34:59] ThiCCboiyG: fair enough
[6:35:07] ThiCCboiyG: i agree
[6:35:09] Recording_on_the_grass: would rather quit wow that pvp
[6:35:27] CrunkyBrewster: eh you just go with it. i use to pvp a lot back in wrath. i loved it
[6:35:29] idabien: wasn't it the opposite in bfa? where pvpers had to do pve to stay relevant in arenas?
[6:35:47] Bugszy: @Troots same mate
[6:35:47] ThiCCboiyG: @Troots i disagree with that though pvp is fun and they should each be able to reach the potentials they need for their equivalent content
[6:35:49] CrunkyBrewster: I think so. although we did have a weekly chest i recall
[6:35:56] chungomungus: @CrunkuTV no these are issues that need to be talked about
[6:36:06] CrunkyBrewster: oh no agreed chun
[6:36:08] timmythegamertv: People could probably argue for the last few xpac's it's been the other way round with PvPers needing to do PvE to be relevant in PvE.. But it is rough..
[6:36:18] xTomHolmes: PvP for PvE gear? Sounds like TBC again
[6:36:23] CrunkyBrewster: its an argument as old as wow really
[6:36:29] timmythegamertv: PvP* LUL
[6:36:33] chungomungus: yeah
[6:36:40] CrunkyBrewster: i remember ppl complaining when blizz sperated pvp and pve gear
[6:36:52] Dcarter: as it should be tbh
[6:37:11] Emleaza: Disc is so dumb for this boss
[6:37:47] Jigsawzz: BROKEN

[6:38:03] nisk___: no trinket
[6:38:17] swordwindgaming: ran 100 heroic necrotic wakes to get the gun, only saw it drop twice
[6:38:31] swordwindgaming: decided to just get the honor weapon
[6:38:37] chungomungus: why heroic
[6:38:38] CrunkyBrewster: when i was doing heroics, i never once saw a single weapon drop. frustrated me
[6:39:17] celzior: what happend with death jesters?
[6:39:22] celzior: @Towelliee
[6:39:34] chungomungus: they were exposed
[6:39:52] squigglytv: I don’t like or enjoy pvp but I feel forced to do it
[6:40:15] idabien: thats how pvpers felt in bfa
[6:40:24] idabien: not sure blizzard will ever get it right
[6:41:10] Thoreya: think the system we have now is the best its been in a while
[6:41:22] chungomungus: disagree
[6:41:32] Jigsawzz: @Thoreya LUL
[6:41:52] swordwindgaming: I think blizzard views pvp as the quasi badge system.
[6:42:50] Thoreya: ya its cheap
[6:43:31] iunbearable: I like it
[6:43:36] WarriorMuffins: its sucks that they completely ruined mythic+ and then added all this awesome gear to pvp
[6:43:39] Bugszy: not everyone likes pvp
[6:43:40] Jigsawzz: inb4 How dare you call it "simple" pvp?
[6:44:05] smashwow: i'm buying popcorn. 2100 is gonna be fun to watch
[6:44:12] Bugszy: oh dude m+ and i dont get anything from them lol
[6:44:12] MurderofPhoenixes: I started pvping 2 days ago and i learned to like it.
[6:44:29] RageQTT: Love doing high keys but honestly the gearing from it right now is making me sad
[6:44:45] Bugszy: @RageCuteT agree
[6:44:55] chungomungus: m+ ilvl is a fucking joke
[6:45:05] swampt1l: when u start getting 1 shot youll hate it @MurderofPhoenixes
[6:45:18] WarriorMuffins: mythic+ is basically useless after 200 since its way more effort than pvp and raiding but doesn't even give loot lol
[6:45:23] RageQTT: Literally have not seen a single weapon drop in my groups since m+ dropped
[6:45:53] Jigsawzz: @WarriorMuffins wow
[6:45:55] swampt1l: im more excited for the m+ mount lol
[6:46:24] idabien: yeah the mount is fire
[6:47:05] WarriorMuffins: idk why they didn't add a free battle pass to mythic plus this expansion. Take away loot but don't even add anything cool to work towards

[6:50:48] swordwindgaming: Its time for 50 dkp minus
[6:53:17] RageQTT: I dont know if it's just me but does this exp feel a little extra melee unfriendly so far? Both in raids and m+
