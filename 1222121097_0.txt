[5:06:39] missalexia1988: NGL swifty you might be better off grabbing the quests for mara or sunken temple and just running those dungeons once, the exp from a quests alone is typically like 50-70% a level
[5:06:51] Bostafani: you will be behind swiffty if you can't get 51 quick enough for this week tho :P
[5:06:53] veiloflonelystars: 6 weeks is soo much better and more doable/fun than the insanity that 3 months was, it also will keep pvp way more alive

With that in mind, we advise players who have found themselves in possession of a high Rank piece of gear to not waste any resources on it, such as enchantments.

[6:38:44] richypc: incoming Peanut nerf Sadge

[6:39:01] back2r00ts: its 3k-6k honor for 1 AV
[6:39:10] Sakrasta: Honor is so bad before AV.
[6:39:20] rbubbaray: swifty what was ur rank before this fix ? R6
[6:40:15] LilSmashi: so when you get to lvl 60 u will have the full blue set?
[6:40:22] Sakrasta: How are the AV queue times?

[6:42:43] itzurboymatt: they should just make whatever change theyre going to make for next week and keep current ranks
[6:42:44] rbubbaray: rank fix
[6:42:46] Sakrasta: PvP will be unplayable, unless you grind rank 13-14. So many people will outgear your 2-3 MC epics.
[6:43:02] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[6:43:19] Dankbiggie: not unplayable lol

[6:43:33] Chosey: just noticed they fixed the pvp ranks
[6:43:47] rbubbaray: Plus R14 gives gear like AQ which is higher
[6:44:01] Chosey: damn you're rank 9?
[6:44:16] elredge: Are you planing to stay 49 for the weekend ?
[6:44:21] Chosey: fix what
[6:44:26] asurakaizen: One more level till you can go to BRD or ST
[6:44:47] Aruze2014: didnt they kind of nerf all honor in TBC to fix it
[6:44:53] Aruze2014: probably just copy pasta
[6:44:53] losthaki: how come av gives so much more honor?
[6:45:15] rbubbaray: its bounus weekend for AV
[6:45:19] Balomyt: Why dont you just do quests for leveling? It's faster I suppose
[6:45:25] rbubbaray: bounus

[6:45:58] Balomyt: Reasonable :P
[6:46:05] Sakrasta: Oh man, worst part about being a streamer on a PvP server.
[6:46:09] TenThousandJawsWillDrop: PJSalt PJSalt
[6:46:13] rbubbaray: but whats cool about AV the amount of quests can get u half a lvl
[6:46:24] losthaki: you need to hire some bodyguards
[6:46:24] Sakrasta: You need a viewer as a personal bodyguard LUL
[6:46:27] rbubbaray: plus rep
[6:46:48] Ludjack: One sneaky rogue
[6:46:54] Big_Red706: That‚Äôs so bad. Like one time is fine but over and over sucks
[6:46:55] Maria_Neefay: So, a c–æw–∞rd basically...
[6:47:01] Sakrasta: You can level in AV, kill the harpies in the cave from 51 to 60 LUL
[6:47:03] ramrod2018: You need a new dungeon  they are green
[6:47:44] Chosey: huh
[6:47:47] BigFatRestoCow: W00t!
[6:47:52] asurakaizen: gotta start that BRD spam for HoJ
[6:48:02] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[6:48:03] saints17137: why not do sunken temple?
[6:48:04] thetexanmando: why not do mara?
[6:48:13] rbubbaray: I did that in classic wo0w , on my lock, I was 55 and killed harpies to get 60, cause the world ganling was unplayable
[6:48:18] Sakrasta: HoJ is not as horrible anymore as in original classic.
[6:48:18] BigFatRestoCow: H-side
[6:48:37] Chosey: 3 more lvls of zf?
[6:48:42] Chosey: oof
[6:49:08] avenomxx: not a big fan of questing ?
[6:49:19] Chosey: sounds more boring than questing lmao
[6:49:27] ramrod2018: Mobs are green tho no experience
[6:49:28] losthaki: @avenomxx  stream snipers
[6:49:40] Oddiiss: why not go meleecleve
[6:49:41] Sakrasta: I like how you are truly playing a hybrid. Dealing damage and healing.
[6:49:46] bombasticpa: you need stealth rogues around you to kill that sniper like john wick type rogues lol
[6:49:46] BigFatRestoCow: The amount of binds you need for Shammie...
[6:49:49] Sakrasta: Too bad that is not possible in raids, that would be cool.
[6:49:51] rbubbaray: yeah dungeons is sooooo long , I fall asleep .lol
[6:49:53] losthaki: he literaly just killed a lvl 48
[6:49:57] losthaki: its just the small adds
[6:50:02] Dankbiggie: you do get xp for green?
[6:50:34] PapaBeks: I have been  watching you level for a few days now, and I am getting massive Vanilla PTSD.... never doing this again
[6:51:03] Sakrasta: Vanilla is so grindy, I think I will hit lv60 in phase 3 LUL
[6:51:05] rbubbaray: yeah the grind sucks
[6:51:24] rbubbaray: I wonder why im playing again
[6:51:36] adkzander: is this hardcore?
[6:51:37] PapaBeks: just wait until they let you buy it like everything else lol
[6:51:45] TenThousandJawsWillDrop: FOMO?
[6:51:54] BigFatRestoCow: Swifty, do you know "Quartz"?
[6:51:56] Sakrasta: I think I will focus on enjoying the leveling through getting some sweet gear from dungeons. Not really in the mood to rush 60 in 2 weeks like in original classic.
[6:52:16] rbubbaray: No he pvps so no HC
[6:52:21] bombasticpa: lol
[6:52:26] xXxforsenBasedxXx: KEKHeim
[6:52:46] Bostafani: i enjoy levelling
[6:52:48] back2r00ts: its fun for me too :)
[6:52:51] leppin_: not while streaming
[6:52:53] schmooplesthesecond: LUL
[6:52:57] Gizadragon: Iits not that bad doin quest
[6:52:58] PapaBeks: no, only psychopaths like leveling, especially during vanilla
[6:53:03] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[6:53:06] Sakrasta: Rested bonus + 40% more quest XP + tons of gear from dungeons, that is nice.
[6:53:10] BigFatRestoCow: In soviet russia leveling Enjoys you!?
[6:53:13] Bostafani: but I don't play on a pvp server (why i like levelling more)
[6:53:14] rbubbaray: I only enjoy lvling till about lvl 10 .lol
[6:53:15] Chosey: I honestly like leveling KEKW
[6:53:24] SgtOneill: @swifty you can go to maraudon or temple of atalhakkar or black rock depths for more xp
[6:53:31] Cowardpatty: Leveling if my favorite part of WoW.  I don't raid.
[6:53:32] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[6:53:52] Srygirls: leveling in new world was fun
[6:53:55] BigFatRestoCow: Its a hard task.
[6:54:02] Sakrasta: I think you are bored by leveling because you have done it so many times already.
[6:54:03] brodycanuck: The leveling for season of mastery shouldve been much faster than it is. I think the only changes are at max level
[6:54:03] rbubbaray: im same way if this game gave us exp for Bgs which they should of done .. it be epic
[6:54:11] leppin_: I personally like questing, not dungeon spamming or any other work around. I just like getting a full quest log of completes
[6:54:29] frankey500: @Srygirls lvling in new world was fun? nah nah
[6:54:31] meowhunnay: @strip_tv agreed ^_^
[6:54:33] rbubbaray: Exp in Bgs should of been a change
[6:54:34] Sakrasta: Season 2 of SoM could really use a bigger XP boost though. Like 100% more from mobs and 200% more from quests. Then you could hit level 60 in around 30-40 hours instead of 100.
[6:54:44] hukkus159: Swifty any tips to lvl faster as a warrior?
[6:54:51] losthaki: i like how you get an armor cache from winning a bg in retail
[6:54:54] back2r00ts: there is low lvl gear in arathi ws
[6:54:55] rbubbaray: Yeah exp in BGs should of been added
[6:54:58] xDarktoast: or more rep from bg¬¥s

[6:55:22] BigFatRestoCow: Yea.
[6:55:24] SgtOneill: swifty you can go to maraudon or temple of atalhakkar or black rock depths dungeons for more better xp
[6:55:24] rbubbaray: I did get 3 bars just now with mobs
[6:55:32] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[6:55:38] BigFatRestoCow: If i was per mobile xp...
[6:55:38] faint_be: how can You be R9 in 2 weeks?
[6:55:45] losthaki: they could just remove slows after like 10 seconds on mobs to prevent it
[6:55:50] Xelim27: they need to buff quests even more
[6:55:50] BigFatRestoCow: it would be a facerole.
[6:55:56] Sowiloo: !server
[6:55:57] BigFatRestoCow: roll*
[6:55:58] brodycanuck: they should just reduce the amount of XP required per level by half
[6:56:36] BigFatRestoCow: Thats even worse.
[6:56:36] Sowiloo: what server are you on
[6:56:46] Skiddy1987: swift would you be back to aweaomse?
[6:56:46] BigFatRestoCow: By half...
[6:57:07] leppin_: This isnt cata, calm down
[6:57:08] BigFatRestoCow: Really?
[6:57:09] greitdet: why not just play retail at that point
[6:57:11] tkez1: what would be the point then? Classic is literally 80/10 leveling - endgame. It would be like leveling in retail if they increase xp rewards.
[6:57:18] BigFatRestoCow: lol
[6:57:23] Sowiloo: 42 is half
[6:57:23] Chosey: might as well just play retail at that point
[6:57:31] clopfoot: swifty did you relog and see fixed rank?
[6:57:33] Berros: all these conveniences got us RETAIL
[6:57:36] brodycanuck: because the SoM is about the raiding being harder, its not about the leveling
[6:57:39] Chosey: if you want FAST leveling play retail
[6:57:47] Poowez: @brodycanuck Amen!
[6:57:52] Chosey: classic is always about leveling
[6:57:55] Chosey: always will be
[6:57:58] brodycanuck: we already leveled less than 2 years ago man lol

[6:58:05] BigFatRestoCow: Retail! lvl 60 in 7 10ths of a second
[6:58:08] lfw002: to stop Mage/Pally boosting of instances, all they got to do is make it so if you have someone significantly higher than the mobs in the dg, they non one gets xp
[6:58:09] Poowez: @Berros Amen there!
[6:58:10] CMack_72: This isn't your grandpa's wow
[6:58:14] Chosey: then why did you play again?

[6:58:19] ryanblue98: swifty tanks and heals
[6:58:35] brodycanuck: I didnt play again, because I didnt want to level again lol
[6:58:40] BigFatRestoCow: Wheres my Grandpah!
[6:58:51] Fight_Monkey: Why cant we just play Classic without all the Classic stuff? LUL
[6:59:12] brodycanuck: Theres already classic servers

[6:59:38] TamStephen: did u keep rank 9 buddy ?
