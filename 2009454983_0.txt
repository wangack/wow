[0:23:08] Spartacuss93: It was orignially green not blue
[0:23:09] NayrAuhsoj: @snooters_ for an easy way to see it, you can shoot an rpg as a heavy on someone 2~3 bodies away, and you'll take as much damage as them ü´°
[0:23:09] cashmurda77: anyone else get login error?
[0:23:10] xdonjulio: lol
[0:23:11] OutrunPilot: The very first depictions of Santa, he was in a tan or brown suit. In 1863 the artist Thomas Nast depicted Santa in a blue coat covered in stars, with red and white striped trousers. In that picture Santa was handing out gifts to Union soldiers.

[0:33:34] Sneaky_Dragon: @Mackle69 that just sounds unfun, and it would do nothing since you could just uncloak straight before shooting, doing nothing to fix the issue. i think you shouldn't be 99% invis while standing still and you should be a tiny bit more visible

[0:36:47] AceOfHalo2: @youngslimer yes
[0:36:48] Sneaky_Dragon: @Mackle69 the problem is that both dash and grapple are inferior to cloak, dash a bit better than grapple, but still
[0:36:49] lighthandler: @VMH_Undead Yes, it's fine
[0:36:49] herm_germ: gg

[0:38:20] sap_yaps: try recon instead of heal beam, its selfish but good
[0:38:21] Sneaky_Dragon: @Mackle69 my main problem with light (i main light) is that it can be unfun to play against
[0:38:21] Mackle69: LULW that was listed on environment that there were trips and turrets I didnt think it was gonna be that bad
[0:38:24] run3th: bruh he‚Äôs playing heavy with no shields

[0:38:38] Mackle69: @Sneaky_Dragon yerrr, I play medium and totally agree
[0:38:39] Spartacuss93: VeNomX03 I would guess the MMR are only in ranked
[0:38:49] chatty_patty93: @shroud can you compare csgo to traditional shooters like this, or there's no comparison?
[0:38:50] renzrivero: @gilim yea he would queue with you Kappa
[0:38:50] No_Apologies20: What does night mode even do other than make the game louder
[0:38:53] Kurizey: @sap_daps Recon is great for your team if you're calling out where teams are at or spawning.
[0:38:54] ez_eyes: idk how you're able to keep your sanity playing this solo
[0:38:56] NiceThaddy: game runs great for me when buildings are falling apart. I was surprised tbh
[0:39:01] Lenny__NZ: light players have object permanence
[0:39:01] fabiator0101: this game is unplayable as solo
[0:39:02] Kolkuhcola: anyone have monitor settings for the asus OLED?
[0:39:03] 420smoke: facts
[0:39:04] Kkpuffs: i think mostly people aren‚Äôt good yet‚Ä¶ playing in Silver still nets you mostly bronze players as teammates almost virtually all the time
[0:39:07] Kurizey: I use Recon only
[0:39:09] Maluco_Doido: yeah I noticed that too
[0:39:10] Ossoler: LUL
[0:39:10] lighthandler: Fact
[0:39:11] NiceThaddy: not true! @fabiator0101
[0:39:11] GrimyAPO: it aint that complicated tho?
[0:39:12] BenIsWell: objective control is a foreign idea to cod players
[0:39:13] HmD925: people cant math and shoot

[0:39:18] adh0cman: isnt this basically CTF though KEKW
[0:39:19] 420smoke: they join and think KD is everything
[0:39:20] AceOfHalo2: @youngslimer oh, i'm talking about in stream game sound
[0:39:20] Sneaky_Dragon: @Mackle69 I'm glad mines got nerfed, mines would 1 shot lights and that a terrible experience, still feels bad to be 1 shot by RPGs, but that's life
[0:39:20] Hardeey1995: SeriousSloth
[0:39:22] inkaditya: lol rude
[0:39:27] Huttle: cod brain is rampant
[0:39:27] Mackle69: its so objective focused and so many people are used to fucking around and playing everything like a dm I think its frying people
[0:39:32] VMH_Undead: i mean it‚Äôs a lot for cod players
[0:39:32] youngslimer: my COD friends just run and cry when they get obliterated
[0:39:32] Shutsky: u need to use recon it‚Äôs OP
[0:39:33] lighthandler: @GrimyAPO Yes, but it is very chaotic and the mechanics are unusual
[0:39:33] Johny_Calamada: game still new but same was in beta so :/
[0:39:34] fabiator0101: @NiceThaddy with no voice chat its gg
[0:39:36] StrydrOfficial: try Light with Throwing Knives next match
[0:39:39] ravnicusTV: cod is fun but yeah
[0:39:45] turk2point0: cod brain cant take money and deposit money? LUL
[0:39:47] VMH_Undead: it‚Äôs not a lot for OW/Apex/R6 players
[0:39:47] 4Predator: @shroud do you want a good teammate? I know someone
[0:39:48] Fatchi7: The concept of not peeking post plant
[0:39:52] spunzzmok3s: @OnlyABanana why?
[0:39:55] OutrunPilot: I hope they come up with new modes of winning, or this cashout thing will get boring in six months
[0:39:56] NiceThaddy: I was doing just fine last night lol @fabiator0101 I have a gross amount of solo hours in apex though..
[0:39:56] Spartacuss93: This game isn't that hard to understand just most people are stupid nowadays LUL
[0:39:57] dwithunn11: Yeah I never solo q this game
[0:39:58] hammydude2001: i say that as a cod person that also dabbles in other games, i see how cod people get overstimulated
[0:39:58] MaryChain: ranked sbmm is strange, im playing with 2 bronze 4 ppl, im gold2 and we are playing against plat 4 -.-
[0:39:59] jokwon96: no they buff it
[0:39:59] its4D4: recon buffed
[0:39:59] robbstarrkk: it was a buff
[0:40:00] crustnugg: thought they buffed recond
[0:40:03] ZayOdeeAZ: no buffed
[0:40:05] MvrkZS: got buffed
[0:40:10] herm_germ: i was reconning last night it was pretty nasty
[0:40:13] hwamoody: they buffed recon it costs less to cast initially
[0:40:14] Sn00ters: also it would seem easier to just find a way to nerf cloak to make dash/grap more motivating to use but in fact i think they need to buff the other 2 instead, i.e. 2 grapple charges would be something and for dash idk really dash is almost still viable
[0:40:23] crustnugg: decreased
[0:40:24] 420smoke: from 2 to 1
[0:40:25] robbstarrkk: the cost was lowered
[0:40:26] MvrkZS: the cost got lowered
[0:40:26] Mackle69: lowered
[0:40:26] Sn00ters: they reduced cost for recon so buffed
[0:40:27] sap_yaps: its super good
[0:40:27] JohnnySpectronYT: @9Two6 it already has
[0:40:28] Clarke667: reduced from 2 to 1
[0:40:28] its4D4: Recon Senses activation cost reduced to 1 from 2
[0:40:29] Haxxor_1989: cost is lower
[0:40:30] fabiator0101: @NiceThaddy playing stacked is alwais better tho, as solo u have to pray to get a decent dou
[0:40:30] xJaayO_: recon was already nerfed in release
[0:40:32] lighthandler: Activation cost
[0:40:34] nftwmusic: it was the cost so 1-1 now
[0:40:34] nexin6: @9Two6 vod dead already
[0:40:35] StimUrplex: I really wish there was a free 4 all cause it‚Äôs impossible to get anywhere without a solid 3 man teams in ranked
[0:40:45] maddoxicity: Overwatch and Apex players seem to fair the best on this game
[0:40:45] NiceThaddy: got a nice 12-0 streak solo :D
[0:40:48] Kurizey: I'm a dy hard recon player with sonar nades

[0:42:21] CopyCatlyn: @kinglazlow make it offline single player. atleast that player base will never have to deal with the annoyance of other hackers.
[0:42:23] Sn00ters: every game has cheaters to this day and the games are alive and thriving, i love the people that are saying cheaters are going to kill this game when this is one of the few shooters where you actual have higher chances of countering them
[0:42:24] nftwmusic: @KuRiZma_Kills i don't mind scar but ammo count bugs me lol

[0:54:26] 4Predator: @TydeerOnTV ah I see, true true, a very low amount of people experienced cb1 and it was amazing
[0:54:34] Ionrage: do you think the TTK on medium build is a bit too low?
[0:54:35] struggling_af: arent they have the same anti cheat as apex?
[0:54:36] JoeNoSay111: is 1080 higher fps better than 1440 lower fps for shooters?
[0:54:38] Sn00ters: @tambo_time not a BR guy unless friends are playing which they really dont but apex was always my fav to watch as well
[0:54:39] lecam82: DESPAIR

[0:55:09] anthonyizftw: no reason why this game doesnt last a while if the devs continue to work on it. but also, not every game has to last forever. its nice to be playing something different IMO
[0:55:10] isosha: @shroud invite them next game)
[0:55:16] HXDES: sbmm is the reason why cod died
[0:55:20] tambo_time: @Snooters_ the core of the game is still incredible. still most satisfying gun play imo and for sure movement mechanics but it just died cause the devs gave us nothing new in the last 2 years

[2:09:14] johnmenisk: @Beamer2EZ Thank you man, will do
[2:09:15] Perfectclear: I think it needs to be more visually clear when you miss due to range so the range can be learned more easily
[2:09:16] HA4ZEE: why the scar over the akm????
[2:09:18] Bad_Wolf_Kurt: Why molli over frag?
[2:09:24] FranekCROLive: @outiztic set TAA rendering, I now have 120-140 fps

[2:09:50] cr4ik: @Bad_Wolf_Kurt molli is better for defned area...frag has no range

[2:09:54] NrgMarduk: What do u mean about drops??are in program some drops for the viewer
[2:09:55] LeDev1L: @HA4ZEE they're both good, it's just matter of personal preference
[2:10:03] newyaboime: @HA4ZEE more rewarding on headshots literaly can kill faster

[2:10:16] bigleapz: light is so bad im wondering why the randoms on my team always playing light and are 0/10 all the time
[2:10:17] Saki9fps: @HA4ZEE scar is better if you hit your shots. ak has more clutch potential because of the ammo.
[2:10:18] UncleKappa69: fcar has 26 dmg per bullet and akm has 20
[2:10:20] ruskied: I wonder if an ESports scene for this game will be successful since it seems heavily geared to making it a thing

[2:11:53] Shutsky: I‚Äôm 100fps on a gtx 1080
[2:11:54] fyberzzafk: @stumppy4 doesn't need them
[2:11:54] ArabDrip: @hoserfx just a bad pc
[2:11:56] meffmeff: the only good change would be to remove the ability to stick C4 on throwables LULW
[2:12:02] Saki9fps: @patatoula009 c4 does less dmg
[2:12:03] machriphi: @Shdeef The games a lot more CPU heavy than GPU generally.
[2:12:05] butterynipp: OhhHh
[2:12:08] Balls_Nasti: @butterynipp nuke is when you attach explosives to a throwable explosive and throw it
[2:12:13] hoserfx: @TheGuyWithNoIdea idk ryzen 7 2700 + 16gb + 2070
[2:12:16] bilochita: why
[2:12:18] finalsmasochist: @stumppy4 it does. they're called grenades, mines, rpgs, and charges
[2:12:20] Shdeef: @machriphi yeah I read a lot about this but mine seems to be the opposite
[2:12:26] Mewted: @Balls_Nasti what did they nerf about nukes?
[2:12:28] butterynipp: Is it on explosion or do you have to time c4?
[2:12:28] FranekCROLive: @theguywithnoidea I think yes, all low except view distance and textures, TAA 80%

[3:34:13] OutrunPilot: Chat you don't understand, whatever your frames is, unstable frame rate drops like 50% makes for heavy stuttering hard on the eyes. Stable constant 100fps is better than 250fps dropping to 180fps
[3:34:14] rmball: ayoo
[3:34:15] ryujota: HUH
[3:34:20] ChubbyMikey: @AceOfHalo2 that's my first rule. IMO, if you can respawn a dead player, it's no longer a BR

[3:34:48] AceOfHalo2: @ChubbyMikey yepp, might be slower paced but that was the OG BR
[3:34:48] ChubbyMikey: Which is why I don't consider PUBG a BR anymore
[3:34:58] iHuse: Our eyes are capped at 24fps anyways
[3:34:58] ScootNoot_: @DubOfficial not on a timer, its a res based system
[3:35:00] saveagodsent: @outrunpilot doesnt Matter, the human eye can only see 30FPS max
[3:35:03] xtzc: @dubofficial so you were not joking? Dam
[3:35:11] doakickflipp: y‚Äôall see pubg mobile has dinosaurs in it now?üòÇ
[3:35:13] insiDisReaL: @OutrunPilot though your point is valid, your example is terrible. 250 to 180 isn't bad, and is definitely much better than 100 steady fps.
