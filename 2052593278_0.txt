[2:57:00] V3R1O5: @skrail16 the guess is an average ~200 exp, i think
[2:57:02] bots_bots: probably a good move
[2:57:03] triggs390: @leroylol I dont think really twitch should get involved to resolve streamer drama
[2:57:07] donkeebrainz: i do

[2:57:19] ntb712: couldnt they just prove you werent viewbotting?
[2:57:24] leroylol: he might escalate it further if you did end up getting him banned from twitch if so
[2:57:30] tacklenfuel: very good take on that.. why punish the guy, just leave him alone
[2:57:30] ScarfaceCEO: You are super reasonable, I hope that I would have the same restraint in such a scenario.
[2:57:33] hardshell: If the guy is talkin not only about you but also ur family, he deserves more than a ban on twitch
[2:57:33] triggs390: @ntb712 I'd guess if he was actually viewbotting he'd be banned?
[2:57:55] Sunderwire_: based
[2:57:59] leroylol: @triggs390 payo is a twitch partner talking shit about another twitch partner live on stream constantly lol
[2:57:59] CALOT_ROGUE: so what excites you the most about phase 2?

[2:58:22] grilledcheeseistasty: would you kiss payo for early acess to phase 2
[2:58:26] triggs390: @leroylol Yeah, but do you really want twitch getting in the middle of any streamer fight?

[2:58:33] joshywoshhyy: not an intelligent topic to start pointing fingers on
[2:58:33] triggs390: @leroylol and imposing their views?

[3:28:11] donkeebrainz: KEKW
[3:28:16] Schokotoast420: mmorpgs is wow or some asian shit. There are Dota and League comparing. Shoooters are shit anyways since lootshoooters fucked the genre. actually BSG3 was the only real "new" shit.

[3:33:14] Lv_100: how are they going about banning them?
[3:33:14] dogecodesyt: they should ban box farmers
[3:33:16] gary_ontwitch: im slightly worried about the "poisoning the well" aspect of it seeign it took 4 years but fuck it, fuck gdkp
[3:33:20] grilledcheeseistasty: crazt gdkp has been around since classic launch - wotlk all of the classic era and now on a seasonal server theyre finally doing it
[3:33:22] bone555: You've probably talked about this, but what do you think about Germany loosing Kaliningrad
[3:33:26] h2h_nillz: i bought the banana for the bank slot LUL sstvWAT
[3:33:29] h00dr0b1n: But what is a better Loot System than GDKP? MS>OS is a trash loot system, if you roll badly for 3 months, how depressing is that
[3:33:33] arsenalenjoyer: all those bots are subs every month
[3:33:34] Schokotoast420: but what about baning donations to streamers then?
[3:33:40] dancewiththepants: Do you think MC will have the same gear?
[3:33:45] lilkim64: what about it being a superior loot system to any other loot system in the game
[3:33:53] tylerificus: This should be a big hit to gold sellers for sure
[3:33:54] handlights: we can gunk their gookers
[3:33:55] triggs390: Then if they dont care for the integrity of their game, why punish innocent players who don't buy gold but enjoy GDKPs?
[3:34:02] BRoKExBoYx: is it possible for bots to get worse with gdkp ban
[3:34:09] Hexes7: they should ban breathing
[3:34:11] Eavesdropz93: How much will pendulum of doom be?
[3:34:19] arsenalenjoyer: Blizzard has new tech for catching bots COPIUM
[3:34:24] Voidbonx: shut down wow Peggers
[3:34:26] dogecodesyt: they should ban box farmers
[3:34:35] Lv_100: but how will they ban GDKPs?
[3:34:35] arsenalenjoyer: remove a lot of the demand for gold
[3:34:38] triggs390: Lots of people (like me) do GDKPs and don't buy gold though
[3:34:39] dreadd39: id be willing to bet they are afraid of banning 20-30% of their active subs bc there are that many bots
[3:34:46] quackums: true
[3:34:50] Schokotoast420: how will u make gold?
[3:34:58] summerjokez: Level golf capacitlevel gold capacityy
[3:34:58] windatar: Was reading around people saying the $ to Gold has fallen off a rock and crashed almost. So its having some type of effect.
[3:35:14] seksmuhchine: was fiishin the other night
[3:35:17] WJBJR: YEP
[3:35:17] wavecadet: thats what i do lol
[3:35:24] Deomas11: 100% facts
[3:35:25] sweatlordkush: YEP
[3:35:27] wavecadet: farmed the gold buyers, and get pieces when i have farmed em enough
[3:35:28] tylerificus: you are benefiting off gold buyers if you are in a gdkp
[3:35:31] triggs390: I go to GDKPs because it gives me a reason to raid when I have gear (or I get gold if I don't get gear).
[3:35:32] eshonxv: yeah you're not innocent, you leeching off the gold buyers
[3:35:35] seksmuhchine: dude flew off
[3:35:42] bots_bots: simonize has an avg payout of 13g over 35 gdkps... CLEARLY oilers in there..
[3:35:44] quackums: all accurate
[3:35:50] Zyxst_: You know its bad when all that is advertised is GDKP and not a single normal run
[3:35:51] Deomas11: Nobody wants to go to a GDKP if there isn't a gold buyer in it. So wether you buy or not, GDKP enables gold buyers to keep buying.
[3:35:51] Schokotoast420: Gdkp is the best loot distributing system there is. Goldbuyers just fuck it up!
[3:36:04] Smokjoker: sstvWAVE
[3:36:09] Schokotoast420: see staystafe
[3:36:14] Taicho116: what if they just made GDKP servers?
[3:36:18] sweatlordkush: "i join gdkps and im not a gold buyer im just good at the game" Kappa
[3:36:19] bots_bots: @Deomas11 gdkp
[3:36:24] TheEndIsNear777: gdkp is not as fair because you can get outfarmed or better farmed or some ppl have more time
[3:36:28] quackums: ive never sold gear in raid but a guy asked for my hat today 50g so i let him have it hahaha
[3:36:29] windatar: Easy fix to people saying. "Well if I don't get gold I have no reason to do." What they should do is give a 500 rep to a random faction at the end of each raid. It's not a huge reward but 500 rep to a random faction is nice.
[3:36:30] TheEndIsNear777: DKP = participation more fair
[3:36:31] quackums: never again tho
[3:36:35] bots_bots: sorry gdkps are a great loot system even without buyers
[3:36:36] vejitas4: @staysafetv i have reported 2 people advertizing GDKPs in trade chat and they are getting banned i have received 2 blue ingame mails saying they have taken action on it
[3:36:39] triggs390: Seems like you're treating a symptom rather than the cause.
[3:36:39] dogecodesyt: Nah we do live in that world. I rather farm gold then lose good loot drops to shitter grey parsers
[3:36:48] seksmuhchine: like straight fly hacked
[3:36:52] Schokotoast420: you seem smart sometimes man
[3:36:55] triggs390: people will still buy gold/bot the game
[3:37:02] sweatlordkush: only ppl that defend gdkps are gold buyers and those that benefit off boosting gold buyers
[3:37:03] numblezzz: @vejitas4 you prob got that mail from different reports, GDKPs are not banned in p1
[3:37:14] electric_f33l: they are
[3:37:22] TheEndIsNear777: I'm glad they banned gdkp, they are NEVER fair, imagine a guy plays 20 hours a day for 1 week to get 500 gold and you play 10 hours he will win the items XD
[3:37:24] triggs390: I don't know if "a lot" is true, but def people buy gold to go to GDKPS.
[3:37:28] Milanesa_De_Pollo: they symptom is 30-45 year old men who have no time and rather buy gold
[3:37:30] triggs390: But people buy gold to do all sorts of things
[3:37:32] realmalfurionsr: @StaysafeTV do you think parsing influencing GDKPs or gold buying to parse higher?
[3:37:37] sweatlordkush: "WELL IM NOT DOING IT SO IT MUST NOT BE HAPPENING" - average gdkp andy
[3:37:37] vejitas4: @numblezzz no i have not reported anyone in months but this two 3 days ago
[3:37:38] dogecodesyt: WHO GIVES AF BAN THE GOLD BUYERS THEN? THEY STILLL WONT BAN THE GOLD FARMS AND BUYERS GTFO OUTTA HERE THEY JUST WANNA BOOST THEIR OWN MONEY
[3:37:40] cloaks: GDKP ban was prolly the best thing that happened since wrath
[3:37:43] Veighten: people ruin it for others
[3:37:44] windatar: GDKP would be a great system if RMT/Bot was 100% removed, but its not so it only irritates the problem.
[3:37:49] Schokotoast420: first time im havin respect for this guy
[3:37:52] sweatlordkush: GDKP ruined wow
[3:38:04] ooooSparkYoooo: I enjoy raiding every class. 2 with guild raid and the rest with GDKPs, Kinda sucks to be shot back to 2 guild raids and the rest just kinda dead now.
[3:38:08] dogecodesyt: no way botters and chinamen ruined WoW
[3:38:11] Greedygoose: gdkps are cancer to wow imo
[3:38:12] BadGerbilLion: GDKP let me pay for my WoW sub with classic gold, otherwise I get the issue
[3:38:22] windatar: I mean, Technically we've had GDKP since TBC, in 2007/8
[3:38:23] TheEndIsNear777: #BringBackDKP
[3:38:26] jerbears: When my guild broke up at the start of BWL, one of our rogues left and started a GDKP guild
[3:38:26] numblezzz: GDKPs give slight convenience, and the supporters disregard the massive degenerate behavior it causes
[3:38:30] sweatlordkush: @dogecodesyt those two things only exist because of gold buyers who spend all their gold in GDKPs
[3:38:34] triggs390: I think people see GDKPs as this black sheep to blame for bots and gold buying, but there should be some criteria for it to come back when it doesnt work. (it wont)
[3:38:37] arsenalenjoyer: For science
[3:38:38] eiba94: @sweatlordkush have you ever done an gdkp? If you do all quests in SoD, and you can chose between rolling on ur bis or putting the gold from ur quest into getting into it, shouldnt u be able to chose which one you prefer?
[3:38:47] lilkim64: no gdkp = raid log, no incentive to play outside raid
[3:38:53] dogecodesyt: Dude IDGAF about GDKP's getting banned every run Im gonn HR every fkcing thing
[3:39:00] Derdy_: most people are just going to raid log now with no gdkp. game will die
[3:39:03] eiba94: I totally hate bots + gold buyers, but blaming gdkp isnt productive since that isnt the problem
[3:39:05] bots_bots: agree
[3:39:14] windatar: After GDKP got banned, the community on reddit and the forums have been celebrating.
[3:39:14] Greedygoose: @Derdy_ i wont miss u
[3:39:21] ATcaribou: @lilkim64 that makes no sense, either way its a lockout.
[3:39:25] ooooSparkYoooo: @dogecodesyt going to be the only way to lead raids now
[3:39:33] triggs390: I do acknowledge that people buy gold to go to GDKPs, of course.
[3:39:35] avoidedneXt: GDKPS will just be called something else
[3:39:36] sweatlordkush: @eiba94 yea ppl who get quest gold arent dropping 400 gold on epics in GDKPs. only like 1% of people that are in GDKPs arent boosters/goldbuyers
[3:39:37] Schokotoast420: Lets try 3 months without staystafeTv and see how its goes
[3:39:39] numblezzz: GDKPs fundamentally make the game pay to win. they are nice in certain contexts, but removes any sense of prestige from having raid gear
[3:39:40] TheEndIsNear777: gdkp = getting outfarmed by the no life 18 hour a day guy so you can't outbid him YEP
[3:39:42] eiba94: Yeah, but why? Why do they hate gdkp? Hate the bots and the goldbuyers.. use bare mortals doing gdkp with quest/boe gold shouldnt  be harassed by you like we are
[3:39:43] eshonxv: nerds crying because they cant gdkp anymore is kinda pathetic lmao go join a guild
[3:39:46] triggs390: Yes, 100% they do - but so do other things in the game IMO
[3:39:49] TheEndIsNear777: *even without bots/buyers
[3:39:51] ticklemextreme: @Schokotoast420 tf?
[3:39:54] avoidedneXt: i dont think they're going anywhere
[3:39:54] dogecodesyt: Lets see what the game is like without twitch streamers that would be better
[3:39:54] Lv_100: @bots_bots stop butting gold bruh, your the problem
[3:39:55] DjPyro: Have you  bothered keeping up with the Texas Convoy? @StaysafeTV
[3:39:58] Awesomegodx: what are u farming?
[3:39:59] SloMo904: too what extent though? if you were a gold buyer the ban, youre still buying gold after the ban too
[3:40:05] bots_bots: @Lv_100 i have never bought gold
[3:40:07] numblezzz: the same reason why i wouldnt want raid gear being in a wow shop
[3:40:13] Derdy_: why not ban mage boosting as well then?
[3:40:18] eiba94: @sweatlordkush you should try some gdkps man... we just did 3 runs today. 8g, 9g and 12g split ;D most people got their items for 5-10g. I got my epic crossbow for 89g and epic staff for 110g
[3:40:18] Buttsworth: GDKP's do make gold selling and therefore botting worse
[3:40:18] arsenalenjoyer: HUH
[3:40:18] glenncloseisaman: What does GDKP stand for
[3:40:19] Lv_100: @bots_bots but your a bot
[3:40:19] Deomas11: Watch them lift the ban, but bring the token to classic...
[3:40:21] kransk: its just a way the community found on how to meta something, it can be argued that the game was not designed to be like this, but its complicated
[3:40:22] numblezzz: GDKPs are an indirect equivalent of having epics in the wow store
[3:40:29] SloMo904: greed
[3:40:32] bots_bots: @Lv_100 imagine that MrDestructoid
[3:40:32] nitrodubs_: It feels like they didnt like that wrath flopped and are now plugging it into SoD very lazily
[3:40:33] ddaley29: why can’t blizzard use the gdkp raid group to check the recent transactions of players and just ban the gold buyers? @staysafetv
[3:40:34] donkeebrainz: these people arent being genuine
[3:40:38] eiba94: @sweatlordkush and I got 7 chars, so doing quests in 3 sones on all of them gives me a lot more than the 300g ive spent
[3:40:42] Lv_100: @bots_bots your name says it all
[3:40:44] DaddySmelly: Total RMT death, total weeb death
[3:40:48] donkeebrainz: no one is doing GDKPs on quest gold
[3:40:49] donkeebrainz: KEKW
[3:40:57] sweatlordkush: @eiba94 most of ur gold comes from china stop the cap, gdkps are anti-american
[3:40:58] conradical93: I will say, with GDKP you get less people leaving mid raid.  Had a pug BFD end half way through today cus people kept leaving
[3:41:00] eiba94: @donkeebrainz I am..
[3:41:01] donkeebrainz: they are arguing in bad faith
[3:41:01] photek_tn: what does rmt mean?
[3:41:08] spike82q: daily quests  to give them gold
[3:41:13] triggs390: I just don't see the leap of "blizzard sucks at banning bots/gold buyers" to "ban players who enjoy a raid style that admittedly has gold buyers in the raid but has other benefits for raiders who don't buy gold."
[3:41:14] eshonxv: gdkps do fuel the bot mafias, 1 glave in tbc selling for 100k would equal thousands of bots farming for hours for that 1 whale
[3:41:16] blakeshow: I feel like I would hit 40 faster if I had power gum
[3:41:16] photek_tn: ah, gotcha, thank you
[3:41:17] windatar: I mean, they could always go a step further, put personal loot back into the game and remove the ability to trade that item to anyone.
[3:41:19] windatar: Lol
[3:41:21] Ashkandi70: blizzard are the botters/goldsellers
[3:41:23] DaddySmelly: @StaysafeTV they don't have to completely shut down botting, they just have to bring the survival rate for bot accounts to a level that isn't profitable
[3:41:28] sweatlordkush: China is funding GDKPs
[3:41:33] tylerificus: If you like gdkps so much go play era
[3:41:35] revora_: RMT MEANS YOU NEED A PLAB B EZ
[3:41:38] arsenalenjoyer: wE hAvE nEw TeCh tO fInD bOtTeRs
[3:41:40] donkeebrainz: KEKW
[3:41:43] beanman_gaming: @sweatlordkush def isnt china anymore, its been south american for years
[3:41:44] sweatlordkush: KEKL
[3:41:44] ohl315: you’re a god
[3:41:44] spike82q: i gonna be ninja
[3:41:44] eiba94: @sweatlordkush I don't deny that goldbuyers/bots are a problem at all, but blaming it on the gdkps is just st00pid
[3:41:46] windatar: @sweatlordkush And organized crime.
[3:41:49] BadGerbilLion: Thats true actually I was selling lemonade in 2018
[3:41:51] Rosstacular: KEKW
[3:41:56] numblezzz: @conradical93 good point, but its still saying convenience is worth removing integrity from the game
[3:41:57] LittlefootsTreestar: bro I just found a mouse in my trash can 🙃
[3:41:59] vejitas4: LOL shit sandwish hahaha
[3:41:59] electric_f33l: KEKW
[3:42:00] triggs390: People definitely buy gold for GDKPS, but I don't. I got my talwar for 5g.. it's only expensive to be first IMO
[3:42:04] johncrouton44: lol tru
[3:42:06] quackums: dogshit sandwhich
[3:42:06] photek_tn: theres corn in that sammich...
[3:42:07] grilledcheeseistasty: @StaysafeTV  bro lets be honest classic TBC U HAD TO BUY GOLD TO EVEN COMPETE WITH THIS BS
[3:42:07] itska97: ive flipped 200g easy on ah alone
[3:42:08] eiba94: @sweatlordkush I'm hosting 7 raids each reset, now im gonna require 95 +avg logs and full prebis + HR'ing 2-3 items each raid
[3:42:12] dogecodesyt: SAME GOES IRL THEN BAN ALL PEOPLE WHO BUY ANYTHING WITH USD ALL SHIT WAS STOLEN ANYWAYS
[3:42:13] cloaks: @eiba94 its not about removing the problem, its about to reduce the damage
[3:42:19] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 90% of people in GDKPs got their gold throw buying gold, the other 10% from GDKPs
[3:42:21] blasphemousfaith: use world buff for faster move, you can get new one in delivery box to storage
[3:42:27] SloMo904: farm for 5+ hours of spend $10, thats the problem
[3:42:28] sweatlordkush: @eiba94 good
[3:42:47] numblezzz: most GDKPers that dont buy gold just farm gold from GDKPs, which comes from high bidding swipers
[3:42:50] numblezzz: they are full of cope
[3:42:50] eiba94: @Milanesa_De_Pollo You can turn that number around, try 5 gdkp raids and you'll see.. rofl. Maybe in wotlk, but not in SoD
[3:42:51] ATcaribou: anybody saying they made 500g questing on 7 toons to do gdkp is LYING. nobody would spend hundreds of hours questing to by a single epic sword at lvl 25
[3:42:53] eshonxv: yeah they all know they are raiding with gold buyers and benefiting from it
[3:42:55] donkeebrainz: the dog?
[3:42:59] bone555: Woohoo Peggers
[3:43:00] Lionkingler1: BASED
[3:43:03] kransk: BASED

[3:43:33] donkeebrainz: OMEGALUL
[3:43:34] numblezzz: players farm gold in GDKPs and think its legit gold "i never bought gold bro"
[3:43:34] kransk: LMAO
[3:43:37] aBradAbroad: OMEGALUL
[3:43:42] Plathyy: he was on a fresh 80 ret paladin btw....
[3:43:42] quackums: its a business
[3:43:44] blakeshow: true
[3:43:46] blakeshow: they are ruthless
[3:43:47] triggs390: I mean thats just a shitty GDKP then for blacklisting that fast.
[3:43:49] triggs390: shrug
[3:43:52] bots_bots: staysafe do you know simonize? he has a good vid on gdkp (it offers an interesting alternative loot system)
[3:43:55] kransk: yeah it fucks up the game
[3:43:57] TheEndIsNear777: Greed = Ruthelss
[3:43:57] eshonxv: "i never bought gold bro, i just leeched off the gold buyers its totally different!!!"
[3:44:00] TheEndIsNear777: Ruthless*
[3:44:05] Schokotoast420: Lets talk about my mama who never bought gold, but anyway had the best eq only by coming staysafe over and over again playing with here in her bedroom .  Gdkp is bad . u can get it by just working hard!
[3:44:05] RecklessResolve: Honestly, i feel like them doing this too early at lvl 25 wont bring as much results
[3:44:07] aBradAbroad: lets watch
[3:44:12] aBradAbroad: quick react
[3:44:15] DaddySmelly: I got my gold by min bidding GDKPs, lettting buyers get prio then eventually getting the gear cheap once they were geared
[3:44:20] windatar: KEKW
[3:44:21] bots_bots: LuL
[3:44:21] donkeebrainz: KEKW KEKW KEKW
[3:44:25] kransk: F
[3:44:27] sweatlordkush: BASED
[3:44:30] tylerificus: the 20k wasnt enough??
[3:44:31] eiba94: @StaysafeTV what about us hosting gdkp's with no pressure to buy, or blacklisting people, nor deducting people for not buying/bidding just prefer to bid gold for items and not roll for it to get full bis faster?
[3:44:32] kransk: KEKW
[3:44:32] NutterCircus: Anyone that tries to legitimize GKDP is just trying to blow copium up our ass.
[3:44:35] bots_bots: Pepega
[3:44:37] aBradAbroad: BASEDRETARD
[3:44:41] vejitas4: ofcourse GDKP atendees are gold buyers most of them
[3:44:45] BRoKExBoYx: would they ban gdkp on era and wrath also?
[3:44:48] h2h_nillz: so they do ban people for it
[3:44:52] numblezzz: @MadJacker15 the internet ruined everything Sadge
[3:44:59] ATcaribou: @MadJacker15 no thank you. pretty sure i was lvl 40 with 100h played back then
[3:45:00] TheEndIsNear777: Any gdkp copium guy likes getting rich fast
[3:45:03] numblezzz: they dont ban gold buyers
[3:45:08] glenncloseisaman: In burning crusade everyone was RMT'ing, 5k gold for flying, at least 50% of the players bought gold
[3:45:08] Lv_100: @MadJacker15 bro people did this shit too when you were 9 its just you didnt know about it because you were 9
[3:45:10] kransk: what will they earn money on if gdkp is banned?
[3:45:14] numblezzz: sodapoppin?
[3:45:16] Lionkingler1: ai detection would help
[3:45:26] vejitas4: @staysafetv not only that GDKPS host themselves sell gold normal players
[3:45:26] windatar: Blizzard is on record saying they ban in waves, they do this so the botters/rmt have no idea where they got caught.
[3:45:29] Schokotoast420: Lets talk about my mama who never bought gold, but anyway had the best eq only by coming staysafe over and over again playing with here in her bedroom . Gdkp is bad . u can get it by just working hard!
[3:45:36] blakeshow: yeah they needed to
[3:45:36] ChillyHTX: he was doing the onlyfangs for content
[3:45:37] meatseekor: nah it sbc that was his first time so he only got a strike
[3:45:39] revora_: Normally just 3 days too.
[3:45:45] orangemaple24: gdkp was a gold loop people who run it sell gold and earn it back from the buyers
[3:45:57] Lionkingler1: give him 6 months
[3:45:58] johncrouton44: true
[3:45:59] quackums: 2 weeks
[3:46:00] Mahca_: they needed him to keep hc hype
[3:46:04] phoenixfire7112: @StaysafeTV did you see the RFK drama with him commenting on a Tik Tok girls account?
[3:46:05] numblezzz: if they started doing 6 months or perma bans, these degens would stop buying
[3:46:06] kgriefing: BASED
[3:46:10] eiba94: You guys have such a weird view on gdkps.. try 10 runs and see for urself..
[3:46:11] numblezzz: so they dont lose their 15 years of retail mounts
[3:46:13] windatar: Sodapoppin and his HC guild with the other top streamers was litterally the best free advertising Blizzard could ask for, no way they were banning him.
[3:46:14] dogecodesyt: they should ban people who pre-farm rep boxes
[3:46:14] Derdy_: make gold buying perma bans. willl stop gold buying real fast
[3:46:17] RecklessResolve: Banning gdkps while we're at lvl 60 would probably bring more concrete results rather than now at lvl20-40 @StaysafeTV
[3:46:19] gary_ontwitch: even a 24 hour ban so they can say on paper they took action

[3:47:12] Bubblehealftw: my account got hacked by gold farmers back in cata and i got all my stuff back plus a few thousand gold was kinda cool
[3:47:19] ddaley29: you don’t think blizzard could setup an in game gdkp system and use it as bait to catch the gold buyer by tracking suspicious trading activity on gdkp raiders
[3:47:20] TheEndIsNear777: if they don't stop it now items will grow to 20k REAL fast

[4:40:30] jordano111: from google: About one-seventh of the population of Uzbekistan speaks Russian. The Uzbeks are Sunni Muslims, and they are considered to be among the most devout Muslims in all of Central Asia. Thus, about three-fourths of the population is Muslim.
[4:40:35] KCYON: very interesting ty Deo

[4:48:28] PleaseeStop: my quest log is full of turn ins, straight to 27, boxes almost to 28
[4:48:42] Fayne7: how do you know the xp values from crates?
[4:48:49] HardstyleNW: @StaysafeTV Whre are you getting the 180 XP per box number?
[4:48:54] tripledistance: didnt you say you wouldnt store exp?
[4:48:59] triggs390: 20 marks max from WSG? or is there just the time limit
[4:49:03] windatar: @letsgetgoingyo I have family members that loved vacationing in Cuba, they always came back with cigars. over the last like 30 years.

[4:49:34] holographicslushie: Same calculations used to land on the moon, real talk
[4:49:37] triggs390: They said BFD will give a "sizeable" bonus at completion.. I wonder what that will be
[4:49:40] dogecodesyt: STOP FARMING CRATES UR GONNA GET BANNED
[4:49:43] sweatlordkush: did you see the datamined warlock trinket for STV? 20 stam 80 intellect for warlock pet
[4:49:44] KCYON: mizkif pls
[4:49:59] dscountdblchk12: It was datamined at like 25,000 completion plus mob/boss kills I believe
[4:50:07] Krex0r: Je viens d'avoir une annonce, peux tu expliquer l'exp sur les boites
[4:50:20] childish_brandin0: Is that on the PTR or live? Because they said they're up'ing the xp from crates @StaysafeTV
[4:50:26] V3R1O5: What about Pvp ? Will be there some xp droppin ? peepoHappy
[4:50:36] triggs390: How many marks is 25k XP from WSG?
[4:50:46] childish_brandin0: Ah, it said Waylaid, so i thought it would be all
[4:50:56] windatar: So with the added WSG tokens all your hand ins and if you do BFD, you could probably hit almost Lvl 30 in the first hour.
[4:50:58] dj_clerik: @staysafetv have you picked up the first aid training books from arathi yet? could have your sham do that for all your chars if he’s still out there
[4:50:59] dscountdblchk12: If they do buff the lower level crates it will probbaly be for level 1-24 only
[4:51:09] Fayne7: how many crates banked?
[4:51:09] Krex0r: How many boxes so far ?
[4:51:26] therattmoth: i just bought one in dustwallow marsh

[4:52:22] V3R1O5: Its always a good advice to get a book and read WineTime
[4:52:25] holographicslushie: Fact
[4:52:27] KCYON: like irl!
[4:52:43] holographicslushie: Exactly, they lsoe me the second it happens
[4:52:53] Wingsofjanitor: they should do annual economy crashes where they delete all gold in everyone's inventory NODDERS
[4:53:01] windatar: I think the bot population in SoD will dip in phase 2 with the GDKP ban there will be less buyers for gold in SoD and the botters will move to the other versions of WoW because it will be more profitible.
[4:53:04] KCYON: @V3R1O5 NODDERS
[4:53:18] Lionkingler1: questing at 40 will be so much gold
[4:53:28] kamgraba: how it is possible of if i try to log to battle.net there is no my account… I write a ticket in new account… I am so angry…. @staysafetv some ideas?
[4:53:28] holographicslushie: @StaysafeTV Ever heard of Ravendawn? *opens trench coat*
[4:53:34] KhalaVenix: how the fuck did they overlook that
[4:53:37] KhalaVenix: god damn
[4:53:40] V3R1O5: i guess, like they said, lets see what happens. at least blizz is doin´sth
[4:53:55] mattbarz989: ive leveled chars to just farm the 25 quest gold
[4:53:55] KCYON: Thats how most mmos deal with max levels for expansions yeah
[4:53:56] Marksman91: adlJam zug zug
[4:54:04] iron3308: gonna be worst at lvl 40
[4:54:18] drunk_hunk: nerf gold
[4:54:27] Marksman91: give us copper only
[4:54:29] Lionkingler1: just need the 500 currencies retail has
[4:54:30] KCYON: it makes an mmo feel lackluster when gold has little to no value though
[4:54:30] dustydollars2121: Cash OP in real life too
[4:54:31] aBradAbroad: trueee
[4:54:34] WHOisROXIS: but gold is fun
[4:54:35] KCYON: a nice balance would be ideal
[4:54:36] eshonxv: maplestory made no trade servers ssf and they thrive compared to trade servers
[4:54:37] joLyole: just like real life kek
[4:54:40] kable111: mix that with tokens. kills it
[4:54:43] sekuron: no gdkp no bots and most problems are solved
[4:54:44] dustydollars2121: Cash OP too
[4:54:44] avoidedneXt: will never be another good mmo
[4:54:45] V3R1O5: I quit Classic, cause i cant afford the gold. i´m a retarded hobo
[4:54:45] drunk_hunk: YEP
[4:54:48] gary_ontwitch: at the same time, they have never make an endgame forever grind that works as well as jsut gold
[4:54:49] Soarlozer: create unobtainium
[4:54:50] holographicslushie: SOCIALIST!
[4:54:54] windatar: @StaysafeTV What if Blizzard came out and said they were going to cut all gold everyone had in half. To fight gold inflation? Would you support that?
[4:55:08] tripledistance: gold is 2k an oz so over priced
[4:55:11] Nightbot: COVERING THE HUGE SOD PHASE 2 NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kNXGec_1k
[4:55:25] Lionkingler1: spend it on items before that cut????
[4:55:26] KCYON: e.g. "gold" in ffxiv was just for glamour and crafting, and it didn't feel.. right for an mmo. saying that as a fan even
[4:55:33] dustydollars2121: Having liquid cash in real life is OP too
[4:55:33] V3R1O5: @windatar wouldnt change anything LUL
[4:55:37] triggs390: wipe gold at the start of each phase?
[4:55:40] letsgetgoingyo: cant take peoples gold. You have to reduce the income in future
[4:55:47] aBradAbroad: people generally dont like having things taken from them
[4:55:48] Humansoup: sstvWAT Kreygasm
[4:55:49] KhalaVenix: ok so next christmas NODDERS
[4:55:52] kamgraba: how it is possible of if i try to log to battle.net there is no my account… I write a ticket in new account… I am so angry…. staysafetv some ideas?
[4:55:56] Xammy0: give me a week
[4:55:57] triggs390: reset gold to 0 at the start of each phase
[4:56:02] Maruika: this guy out there like thanos with gold
[4:56:05] Pwinzor: audit peoples accounts if they have lots of gold
[4:56:13] sekuron: taking stuff/gold from ppl is always bad
[4:56:15] KCYON: @Pwinzor lmaooo jeez
[4:56:25] letsgetgoingyo: taking peoples gold is literally communism
[4:56:28] V3R1O5: @V3R1O5  BasedGod
[4:56:42] trebolz: Im off to bed have a goodnight everyone
[4:56:44] windatar: I mean no ones taking the gold, just everyone is losing half.
[4:56:58] KCYON: @trebolz o7 gn!
[4:57:02] garbobean: rip
[4:57:17] aBradAbroad: KEKL
[4:57:17] Marksman91: typical LUL
[4:57:21] holographicslushie: So think about irl. When someone gets paid they are usually being watched while they make their income, supervised. Hard to do that in an mmorpg. While I agree actions and input should equal output and income, it feels really hard to monitor in the virtual world.
[4:57:26] triggs390: should be able to unvendor?
[4:57:31] windatar: Another good way to control inflation is to put taxes into the game to siphon off gold from the system.
[4:57:35] dustydollars2121: @aBradAbroad bit you right in the ass
[4:57:39] sweatlordkush: oshi warlocks are getting felguard rune
[4:57:41] rylux_: are you dungeon grinding p2 ?
[4:57:46] KCYON: you calculate their income just like irl
[4:57:47] V3R1O5: this sample/track is iconic, btw gachiBASS
[4:57:51] KCYON: with opportunities to make big cash
[4:57:53] Marksman91: adlJam
[4:58:01] MysoreMango: I'm not opposed to the idea of resetting the market every couple of months. They reset the gear needed for each phase,  would resetting the economy be bad?
[4:58:04] Ha_wk9: Can you finish up multiple supplies?
[4:58:21] KCYON: it just doesnt feel right to "reset" cash imo
[4:58:24] Ha_wk9: thx man!
[4:58:32] Fayne7: did you see the post that they're going to be unique 12? what will happen to the excess
[4:58:47] aBradAbroad: people would find ways around
[4:58:49] reimur: we should just reset the economy irl
[4:58:50] triggs390: I think resetting gold to 0 may be more fair than cutting in half
[4:58:58] tsmokez00: chat what song is this in the background
[4:59:01] KCYON: so for aesthetics
[4:59:03] mediocritygaming: haris pilton's bag
[4:59:05] dustydollars2121: @reimur if only it were that easy
[4:59:11] LA7ARUS_: @StaysafeTV Phase Gold Caps, Take my money!
[4:59:14] OptimusBanana420: i never bought 10g ashenvale mount
[4:59:16] KCYON: yes that would work
[4:59:16] V3R1O5: Isn´t Re-Spec a nice Gold-Sink Kappa
[4:59:27] sekuron: gold buyers will emerge
[4:59:29] holographicslushie: fact of the matter is...it's hard to combat bots? At least that's the explanation I see from the consumer side. Is that far off? Or oversimplified?
[4:59:32] eshonxv: there was a rich guy that said "redistribute the wealth idc, the same ppl will end up rich again and the same ppl will end up poor again", just reset the economy is kind of a retard short term solution
[4:59:33] Locky987: every expansion has one
[4:59:37] aBradAbroad: would be great if they implement a ton of that kind of stuff
[4:59:47] MysoreMango: But wouldn't that encourage people to get more botted gold? People will want the 5k gold for the mount even if jts not necessary
[4:59:52] KhalaVenix: i mean the 5 mil AH mount was a prime example
[4:59:52] BinksMagnus: there's been a mount like that in pretty much every expansion since Wrath
[4:59:58] V3R1O5: but true words: ingame-goldburning
[5:00:06] plantbaseddav1d: The AH tax is the OG gold sink
[5:00:07] Locky987: Longboi
[5:00:13] KCYON: if a market is based of skill then its true the market reset would result in a similar situation
[5:00:13] nighthowlsid: What about the Spider
[5:00:18] Synoble: Mekgineer's Chopper, Vial of the Sands, 500k Spider, etc
[5:00:20] sweatlordkush: longdick
[5:00:21] ShroudedFoxx: 5 mil gold longboi
[5:00:23] MysoreMango: Thats what she said
[5:00:24] realmalfurionsr: $500 mount right?
[5:00:25] tripledistance: asmongold
[5:00:28] Fayne7: Did you see the screenshot where crates are capped at Unique (12), any idea what will happen to the excess?
[5:00:33] BinksMagnus: wasn't the spider 2M
[5:00:36] mrforsaken8: @staysafetv i was just wondering, why are such an anti israel and why are you feeling that israel is a problem for the US? They've been our trusted allys in the middle east for so many years and they really love us and suppprt us on everything..you mentioned that earlier and i must admit your perspective is a little strange to me.

At 20 months, toddlers start gaining better control of their ability to run.  If you walked 3mph for 12 hours a day, for 20 months straight, you could walk 87% around the equatorial circumference.  20 Months is almost as long as the Mexican-American War.  In 20 Months, if you were Voyager I, you could've traveled past Jupiter.  In 20 months, 52,600,000 seconds have passed.  And I'm happy that so many of them were watching your stream  <3

[6:35:41] bots_bots: tier 2

[6:35:47] triggs390: or even 1k
[6:35:50] SavageLoaf: @coeursiy They are no longer Palestinians, they are a group of Islamic oriented fundamentalists running a corrupt Pirate State called Gaza.  The main objective for anyone supporting these pirates is to pretend that we should not support Israel because we have no buissness being in the Westbank diplomaticly. This strategy is not working and it will never work - we will destroy the Pirate State wether you like it or not.
[6:35:52] bots_bots: yes.. but tier 2 still give something
[6:35:55] bots_bots: thats the whole point
[6:35:58] jimzyz98ttv: you surely have gold for 14 slots right

[7:18:08] revora_: I have 300 faps LUL
[7:18:11] imaten10: rogues always want it for their tea and it comes from herbs that dont sell for much so it alway holds values
[7:18:12] OrganikCum: it stays high in classic, swiftness pots and thistle tea are both endgame consumes
[7:18:15] TheDastardlyD: it's random which is why it's so high
[7:18:42] AaahhRealAliens: nnothingn like some coffee, early AM wow and staysafe

[7:33:21] Veldigodt: @StaysafeTV Will you do SPELLCLEAVE up to 40 ?
[7:33:22] TheSanguist: I just feel the cash flow needed to fill 220 boxes is impossible.
[7:33:27] Xahvion: @The_Venom_Inside than they changed in the last 48 hours, i recovered my last one on friday, and still have them in my mail box

[9:30:09] coeursiy: denazification went too far
[9:30:26] letsgetgoingyo: they made it illegal
[9:30:27] jehina: Maybe they should try that in the entire middle east
[9:30:28] AceOfFlame: aka Brainwashing the brainwashed
[9:30:29] gucciwizardd: I think losing the war worked better
[9:30:30] WhaleBlast: I would consider the Germans to be the most soypilled Europeans after maybe the Swedish so yes
[9:30:39] daijahaden: It was and it wasn't. The population was largely denazified. But plenty of "alte kameraden" stuck around in the military and government.
[9:30:41] fietsopa4: When I saw the human skin lamp I stopped being a nazi
[9:30:44] WhaleBlast: Thier energiewinde was fucking retarded

[9:31:27] gucciwizardd: cant compare russia with nazi germany
[9:31:33] AmarokUnchained: @fietsopa4 i am still planing for a blimp
[9:31:49] Rebukenx: Doing the roman salute is also illegal
[9:31:53] AceOfFlame: I personally believe that no country should be allowed
[9:31:55] EmanuShow: No they use other symbols now^^
[9:32:07] WhaleBlast: well AFD is getting a lot of votes in the countryside right
[9:32:07] Etsku: pepoG according to my calculations 99%
[9:32:16] conclava_: in the garage with the motorhead cd and rebel flag
[9:32:16] NutterCircus: But are they Patriotic?
[9:32:26] Goldbowser: Well our far right party is gaining plenty of support right now. And leftist decide to do huge demonstrations, with slogan "gegen rechts" so "against right" in which basically they judging conservatives and calling them right, essentially calling this democratic well established party same as the new far right AFD party ... which is a huuuuge mistake
[9:32:45] shiggydoo43: isnt the roman salute a closed fist that you touch to your chest and then straight forward, not up?
[9:33:12] Goldbowser: point being, there is a difference between conservative voter ... and right extremist.
[9:33:13] fietsopa4: The left wing parties need to defend democracy and ban AfD
[9:33:25] forest_elf_: so how about the deluge of late, huh? FeelsOkayMan have we got some rain going on, or what hehe
[9:33:25] Etsku: @shiggydoo43 idk test which one you get arrested on KEKW
[9:33:25] WhaleBlast: @Goldbowser which well established democratic party would be the same as aFD?
[9:33:27] dzzyx95: @fietsopa4  lmao
[9:33:30] letsgetgoingyo: the left has managed to demonize all right wing politics based on nazism. Its ridiculous
[9:33:50] gucciwizardd: issues stems from difference of interests, so speaking about them does not do alot
[9:33:51] WhaleBlast: You know what I'm worried about? Actual voter fraud KKona
[9:34:01] Goldbowser: @WhaleBlast none would be the same.  but latest demonstrations are calling mr friedrich merz , head of CDU party, a nazi or far right. same as AFD. which is completely wrong
[9:34:02] shiggydoo43: @StaysafeTV if people just keep screaming "fire" in a crowded theatre, or keep screaming "rapists" when they see brown legal immigrants on the streets, thats different tho
[9:34:04] Andiells: When the war at palestina started germans started marking doors of jude ppl houses .
[9:34:10] NutterCircus: "Actual" ?????
[9:34:12] coeursiy: you can't be pro-democracy without making some political parties illegal. it's called the paradox of tolerance, chud

[9:34:40] shiggydoo43: @StaysafeTV that is the level of talking points for the rightoids
[9:34:42] MaxieOnTV: @shiggydoo43 This makes literally no sense
[9:34:47] GoshiTheBroshi: SCHIZO
[9:34:47] 0xlogi: afd is the only hope for my country but people are dumb and cowards and vote the established parties
[9:34:47] fietsopa4: Immigration has been an overall positive for Germany sure there are a few bad apples
[9:34:49] shiggydoo43: @StaysafeTV they fear monger and generalize
[9:34:59] WhaleBlast: @coeursiy thats dumb
[9:35:07] clappuchino: just making shit up as you go lol typical
[9:35:21] conclava_: one more time
[9:35:22] letsgetgoingyo: @coeursiy so why isnt communism illegal?
[9:35:22] coeursiy: @WhaleBlast it's exactly how they rationalize it
[9:35:24] Humansoup: Based
[9:35:24] Goldbowser: @fietsopa4 i disagree.. was fine a few years ago. but the statistics so far are brutal ..... brutally awful
[9:35:25] WhaleBlast: if people are too dumb to vote for parties that would be "good", then your society is not ready for democracy
[9:35:28] happyheals: I am pro Republic
[9:35:30] gucciwizardd: you have to punish people who will evaborate democracy
[9:35:35] NutterCircus: "Bad" Ideas are a sign of trouble.
[9:36:00] coeursiy: @letsgetgoingyo because conservatives have no balls
[9:36:18] QuestFor420: @StaysafeTV  thanks for streaming so much this week recovering from surgery rn
[9:36:18] happyheals: it is a facade. It is a totalitarian regime
[9:36:23] clappuchino: Someone else
[9:36:34] shiggydoo43: There is no society with unlimited speech though, not even the US, if someone calls for someone to be lynched for example you dont really get to outdebate them, supreme court says thats not protected
[9:36:42] cargera: are there any ideas that you would consider completely irreconcilable with a democratic state?
[9:36:44] letsgetgoingyo: @coeursiy well thats one thing, but the real reason is because the left is the one in power and they use that power to ban opposition under the guise of "democracy"
[9:36:46] WhaleBlast: You know, I do find that fear turns intelligent people into morons on many spectrums of issues, and this problem causes democracy to faulter too, together with an increasingly complex society becoming too large for our current democratic organs @StaysafeTV
[9:36:48] OrganikCum: do you like trumps chances versus biden and his immigrant army?
[9:36:56] daijahaden: Feels like half of europe is being given the choice of "vote for nazis", or vote for "open borders, replacement migration". It's not good.
[9:37:17] Sheepyogirl: nazi good?
[9:37:33] gucciwizardd: what do you mean with status quo? if the status quo means democracy then i dont see a problem
[9:37:36] conclava_: get a grip buddy
[9:37:42] GoshiTheBroshi: @OrganikCum no
[9:37:43] BigBadMojoMan: yeah - that's called fascism
[9:37:55] happyheals: Infringing upon a right given to citizens is tyranny
[9:38:03] letsgetgoingyo: @daijahaden thats only because the open border group calls anyone against them nazis. But most right wing parties in europe are in fact not nazis lol
[9:38:07] GoshiTheBroshi: why is trump even running again arent they just gonna steal the election a second time? xDD
[9:38:23] spansonite1: <3 making money SSSsss TheIlluminati bigtime hustler LUL PogChamp
[9:38:28] coeursiy: @letsgetgoingyo "democracy" is an illusion. everyone wants their people in charge. the difference is leftists use power when they attain it, and right wingers don't
[9:38:29] sircrumpler: "democratic Republic of North Korea"
[9:38:31] AceOfFlame: The romans had a semi democracy that led to nothing but war to build their empire
[9:38:35] happyheals: The United States is actually supposed to be a Republic
[9:38:45] WhaleBlast: You know, I do find that fear turns otherwise intelligent people into morons on many spectrums of issues, and this problem causes democracy to faulter too, together with an increasingly complex society becoming too large for our current democratic organs. monkaHmm Thoughts streamer, chat?
[9:38:46] NutterCircus: @happyheals Rights are not Given to the people, limits are given to the US Gov through the Const.
[9:38:53] PineTarKush_TTV: Hitler was voted for in a democracy so..
[9:39:02] Ecteleon: Yea it depends on the demographics and culture of that zone also
[9:39:13] happyheals: yes
[9:39:14] sircrumpler: Yep
[9:39:17] daijahaden: @letsgetgoingyo Yep definetly true here in Sweden with SD. But I don't know about AFD. Is their stance mass deportation of foreigners, even productive well-integrated ones?
[9:39:22] spansonite1: we come from da Romans and a primarily Judeo-Christian naming system...
[9:39:24] letsgetgoingyo: @coeursiy i agree with you, when the right gains power, they are afraid to use it because the left throws a fit and uses the power of mass media to punish. Even if that use of power is legitimate
[9:39:25] gucciwizardd: the pures form of democracy is switcherland?
[9:39:26] NutterCircus: Democracy with Laws.
[9:39:28] shiggydoo43: ah the enlightened centrism take
[9:39:33] happyheals: thus the need for differing ideologies
[9:39:43] Wixozet: lets go techocracy
[9:39:53] fietsopa4: The founding fathers owned slaves
[9:39:55] Rebukenx: gangrape is democratic monkaHmm
[9:39:57] spansonite1: for example my name is David. Hi Staysafe.
[9:40:07] coeursiy: democracy is the worst type of government. no functioning organization at scale uses it
[9:40:09] spansonite1: <3 VoHiYo
[9:40:11] letsgetgoingyo: @daijahaden not sure about AFD, im danish. But our right wing parties were also demonized as nazis, even though they were just milquetoast nationalist/center right
[9:40:19] Furydeath9: just think we might elect people with the most votes monkaCOPTER
[9:40:20] Humansoup: Let's Go !!!
[9:40:21] 1c3m4n: Sorry late to the stream, have you compared EU to US yet?
[9:40:25] WhaleBlast: fietsopa :classic
[9:40:28] NutterCircus: the US is a Democratic Republic, where the Gov should follow the laws we have given it.
[9:40:34] BigBadMojoMan: US is supposed to be a representative democracy, people do not create laws, people elect reps to make laws - but in actuality, US is a plutocracy full stop
[9:40:47] Ecteleon: Democracy disregards the opinions of 49% as well, in a basic sense
[9:40:55] gucciwizardd: that sounds like the EU
[9:40:59] pappej: BASED
[9:40:59] NutterCircus: Thats a horrible system.
[9:41:02] daijahaden: @letsgetgoingyo Cool. Yeah our "extreme right wing" party is pretty much just normal Danish social democrats. Society has come around, but it took its sweet time.
[9:41:02] coeursiy: and that's why they did nothing for thousands of years
[9:41:04] justsmilin247: thats extreme
[9:41:04] shiggydoo43: that is how the EU works, even to set its budget they need unanimity, thats why its so slow
[9:41:08] pappej: Nothing ever happens...
[9:41:11] happyheals: to the Republic for which it stands
[9:41:23] yousurpertv: what if their vote was raiding the other villages..
[9:41:26] pappej: NO CHANGE! BASED
[9:41:34] tussmack: that probably works if youre a tribe of 200 people, the minority would be socially pressured to agree
[9:41:37] shiggydoo43: the EU will likely switch to majority voting because everything is taking too fucking long and one country can veto everyone else
[9:41:43] letsgetgoingyo: @daijahaden haha yeah exactly. Congrats on getting a right leaning government btw! huge election for swedes
[9:41:43] Ecteleon: Thats why some laws need votes of all and some of majority I guess
[9:41:45] EmanuShow: Depends maybe they were happy with that form of life
[9:41:53] gucciwizardd: it all comes down to interests imo, are they alligned or not
[9:42:01] AmarokUnchained: democratic process is slow in its nature
[9:42:03] WhaleBlast: Personally I think the athenian system can work better than the type of democracy we have today, representative democracy. It would have to be done by people that actually have to read up and debate on the thing they are voting for, though.
[9:42:18] NutterCircus: The first laws of the US were the Constitution, which were limits place on it.
[9:42:22] WhaleBlast: solon
[9:42:23] daijahaden: @letsgetgoingyo Cheers! Maybe we'll even be a sane functioning country again in a couple of decades.

[9:42:41] Vorsichtkrit: how much supply crates u have ? @StaysafeTV
[9:42:51] coeursiy: the founding fathers only wanted white land-owners to vote
[9:42:56] daijahaden: Rome and Greece were both oligarchys. Not democracies in the modern sense of it.
[9:42:56] happyheals: The U.S. needs a form of parliament to implement representitive democracy. To give minority political ideologies representation
[9:43:00] shiggydoo43: @WhaleBlast lmao thats not athenian democracy at all, you just had to be a "citizen" aka you were from a certain noble family and everyone outside of athens but under its territory was excluded, not to mention slaves and second classes
[9:43:01] Humansoup: Based

[9:43:23] Ecteleon: That democracy would work better nowadays, not letting the regular folk have an individual vote, but their representatives has a vote
[9:43:29] pappej: We need a benevolent dictator
[9:43:30] fviii: Pepega
[9:43:36] shiggydoo43: @WhaleBlast athenian democracy was not debate club bro, read a history book
[9:43:40] shiggydoo43: it was an oligarchy
[9:43:42] shiggydoo43: literally
[9:43:44] gucciwizardd: it was simpler times back then, stuff have gotten more compicated with time
[9:43:45] Wolfurious_: thanks a lot
[9:43:45] WhaleBlast: @shiggydoo43 I studied history moron
[9:43:46] happyheals: it was the first form of "Jury Duty" like appointments

[9:44:34] shiggydoo43: @WhaleBlast then you wouldn't pretend an oligarchy is debate club, you didnt get a vote because you were smart, but because you were already a qualified citizen and born with the right

[9:44:56] Sawces: have you been using those blood shards and get buffs when you rotate to/from TB?
[9:45:00] WhaleBlast: do you know about the wisdom of crowds? I think if you implement direct democracy properly that allows everyone to come to their own conclusions, the average will be much closer to reality than what representative democracy can come up with
[9:45:19] methamphgroyper: It all gets so much easier when you finally realize it's the jews.

[9:46:12] TP7even: u guys reckon it would be good exp boost to do BFD 10 man at the start of p2?
[9:46:17] drathan249: yeah
[9:46:21] Humansoup: It's True
[9:46:22] shiggydoo43: @WhaleBlast lay off the insults kiddo you made a wrong statement about history lol
[9:46:24] QuestFor420: these are all true because humans vary
[9:46:24] gucciwizardd: how would someone know someones elses intention?
[9:46:25] sircrumpler: You can see this present in school with group projects
[9:46:27] WhaleBlast: Look up wisdom of crowds. more people make better decisions if done properly @StaysafeTV
[9:46:32] coeursiy: literacy tests are racist, requiring IQ is racist, etc. etc.

[9:46:56] metel7: also 18 yrs vs not
[9:47:05] tussmack: was that bot shootin a stucked mob?
[9:47:06] gucciwizardd: it is not about who is better, it is about interests.. who have interests in the country being great and who dont care
[9:47:10] happyheals: What you will end up with is a system where you are told that someone is the right choice to lead along with an electorate that acts as a yes man
[9:47:15] donkeebrainz: sophia deserves a vote
[9:47:21] shiggydoo43: in the US you can become a naturalized citizen and vote thats pretty good
[9:47:25] Mind_G0bl1n: since when are women allowed to vote
[9:47:28] WhaleBlast: it should be 30 like in ancient athens and also have an upper limit monkaHmm
[9:47:29] donkeebrainz: correct
[9:47:30] FluffyDK: wait felons can't vote in the USA? God damn
[9:47:30] jehina: in US you dont allow that no
[9:47:30] QuestFor420: idk
[9:47:31] sircrumpler: Depends on us state
[9:47:35] Furydeath9: well some felons pepeJAMJAM
[9:47:41] jehina: in Sweden you do allow it, as it is a right
[9:47:43] sircrumpler: Florida let's them in quite sure
[9:47:47] armega4432: what in the hell are you degens doing up at this hour....
[9:47:51] Creampuff1112: the criminal thing is weird for us in the EU
[9:47:59] happyheals: there are programs to restore voting rights. I think the last president enacted that
[9:48:00] Sawces: yea state thing, but its deff most
[9:48:06] EmanuShow: Well felons voting in sweden isnt a big problem
[9:48:16] QuestFor420: 100?%
[9:48:16] Mind_G0bl1n: and calculus 3
[9:48:17] drathan249: Once they win an ellection with non-citizens, they will always import more and win forever
[9:48:21] daijahaden: Technocracy is good in theory. But human psychology destroys it in the end. You can be a genius and still believe in utterly  moronic things. Just look at universitys.
[9:48:23] WhaleBlast: you're exluding pretty much 95% of certain minorities with that
[9:48:25] jehina: but allowing them, anyone, to vote does not mean they think they are BETTER at deciding.. it just gives them the possibility to have their voice heard.
[9:48:28] coeursiy: we used to have them. civil rights act makes them illegal
[9:48:34] conclava_: that is what a call center does
[9:48:34] AaahhRealAliens: that would be deemed racist
[9:48:36] gucciwizardd: that will be miss used
[9:48:37] death_fisted: dems would have no votes if they did that
[9:48:38] iscamog: good way to filter out scammers
[9:48:51] sircrumpler: @daijahaden yep, used to lean to wanting technocracy. Hell no nowadays
[9:48:59] EmanuShow: I think voting is partially to keep things based

[9:49:35] tussmack: do you think such a system could be rigged to simply not allow unwanted voters
[9:49:41] EmanuShow: Idea of a human being god is no more
[9:49:45] conclava_: if you got someone in mind for president go ahead a cast a vote
[9:49:48] shiggydoo43: but initially Xi was just a really good administrator who was promoted
[9:49:50] Eran_: the tests could be made in a politically biased way tho
[9:50:00] QuestFor420: yep
[9:50:00] Andiells: Easy to make. Ppl voting for Biden = cannot vote for life ? Keepo
[9:50:02] EmanuShow: Except among a few
[9:50:03] WhaleBlast: I respectfully disagree and that is ok because I think you should be allowed to think whatever you want YPE
[9:50:06] coeursiy: @gucciwizardd i don't think anyone should vote, that would apply to me. the outcome is what matters, it's selfish to want otherwise
[9:50:15] happyheals: Naturalization
[9:50:16] pappej: That sort of test would lead to outrage since people would feel like the test is rigged if they fail and they are being oppressed
[9:50:18] sircrumpler: You really should have to understand government to vote idc
[9:50:29] pappej: But I agree in principle
[9:50:31] letsgetgoingyo: Not with having children or with voting.
[9:50:36] wc3mr_lisa: and with guns
[9:50:39] NaManDatAintMe: we see it as a basic human right lol
[9:50:44] Eran_: its not a flaw of the current democracy, its the intended design of this model
[9:50:44] Rebukenx: If you were to make a test, the people creating the test would have the power
[9:50:50] seksmuhchine: ok sure
[9:50:53] NaManDatAintMe: even a dumbass has a say lol
[9:50:59] spansonite1: DinoDance
[9:50:59] WhaleBlast: you would pretty much exclude minorities from whatever governs them in society
[9:51:03] Mind_G0bl1n: comptency test written by woke professors
[9:51:06] NutterCircus: Schools used to teach Civics.
[9:51:08] shiggydoo43: @StaysafeTV would you like it if it was like in China where the ruling class chosevamong themselves the most competent guy to administrate the country
[9:51:08] Eran_: @rebukenx 100%
[9:51:11] conclava_: clearly this is fox news the video game
[9:51:13] letsgetgoingyo: i just think there should be stricter rules, not necessarily a test that can be biased. Like raise the age limit to 25 at least
[9:51:16] seksmuhchine: how many sin up to vote
[9:51:20] happyheals: "keep your constituents ignorant and your message divisive" -Some Politician
[9:51:20] sircrumpler: Woo enough money and lie to as many voters
[9:51:25] WhaleBlast: big business
[9:51:27] AustralianFASTbowler: then that minority group can go live in the country where they are the majority?
[9:51:27] AceOfFlame: me :)
[9:51:27] Mind_G0bl1n: the media
[9:51:31] MrJimmyBanks: woot?
[9:51:33] WhaleBlast: those with a lot of money
[9:51:36] Rebukenx: Right now its the one who is most corrupt and has media influence
[9:51:37] donkeebrainz: demagoguery
[9:51:45] gucciwizardd: who appeals the best to the peoples interest
[9:51:46] letsgetgoingyo: those who can buy the politicians and the media narratives
[9:51:47] coeursiy: people who win elections are just good at winning elections, not governing
[9:51:49] therivalmo8: you dont think there would be some kind of fraud with who can and cant vote? like how big pacs/lobbyist push for corporations for less regulations and push for shit that drives profits but activity hurts/kills the everyday man?
[9:51:51] manualbertol1: also voting makes you responsible of the outcome even if you didnt vote for the winner, you cant say later that the goverment isnt yours
[9:51:54] AceOfFlame: Influencers would have most power
[9:51:54] Ecteleon: In corrupt countries, it would mean doom for the system
[9:51:59] craftyz420: Competent people still fall to traps of politicians
[9:52:00] FluffyDK: staysafe for president 2028?
[9:52:02] Jarkeler: Who wears the best booster boots to make themselves look taller
[9:52:03] daijahaden: I think there's a principle case to make. If a large part of your income is taken by the state and redistributed. Then you probably ought to have a say, even if you're retarded.
[9:52:07] pappej: An interesting dynamic in Monarchies back in the day is that the King would take the side of the masses against parliament which was working on minority rule
[9:52:16] therivalmo8: I agrre
[9:52:20] Vunoka: hallooo mein freund staysafe
[9:52:28] happyheals: there is rampant fraud across the country in every election on both sides
[9:52:28] jarl_b: politicans are more sales ppl then leaders imo
[9:52:30] Rebukenx: People vote predictably, I could effectively decide who wins if I made the questions
[9:52:32] gucciwizardd: what does competent and aware mean? who gets to deside this?
[9:52:45] WhaleBlast: aware voters would be good, but I think inclusion is more important than competency because of the same reason states also get to vote independently on issues
[9:53:01] Furydeath9: meanwhile most people in congress doesn't know how the internet works
[9:53:01] EmanuShow: Thats partially the reason for modern democrasy coming from public schooling and people getting aware
[9:53:10] NutterCircus: Then the IQ tests become rigged.
[9:53:11] sircrumpler: I think a basic government structure test is all you need
[9:53:27] Jarkeler: Must have 200+ IQ to vote 5Head
[9:53:35] EmanuShow: Bad schooling = bad democrasy
[9:53:38] therivalmo8: I wish there was a way for something like that but we all know that corporations and politicians dont play by the rules
[9:53:38] AmarokUnchained: churchill allegedly said something like: "the biggest argument against democracy is a 5min talk with a voter"
[9:53:41] conclava_: i wanna see d trump dunk a basketball
[9:53:42] happyheals: most people don't know there were 12 leaders of the United States before George Washington
[9:53:51] gucciwizardd: sounds complex in a country like mine with 10+ parties
[9:53:52] Herathas: In Sweden we can vote at 18 but we cant buy alcahol untill 20 xD @StaysafeTV
[9:53:56] letsgetgoingyo: "which candidate is the closest to nazism and we shouldnt ever vote for?" - the left making the test
[9:54:03] SammieKK: What does IQ have to do with how you want the society you live in should work?
[9:54:04] Eran_: @nuttercircus I dont think IQ tests can be rigged
[9:54:06] daijahaden: So a low IQ professional athlete who pays millions of dollars in taxes, shouldn't have a right to vote?
[9:54:10] markja629: but who makes the test?
[9:54:10] craftyz420: European here, in the US do they teach how government works in schools? It's generally not something taught where I'm from, just interested
[9:54:26] AceOfFlame: isnt that already a thing?
[9:54:29] virucs: You COULD abselutly do it in a very good way, but the question is then, can you make it immune or resistant to corruption?
[9:54:33] Rebukenx: I renounced my US citizenship GIGACHAD
[9:54:35] Jarkeler: @craftyz420 It's taught, but some people pay attention and some people dont
[9:54:36] NaManDatAintMe: the citizenship exam lol
[9:54:49] EmanuShow: Ye i think us citizen test is a good thing for being able to be voting
[9:54:52] AmarokUnchained: Vivik was right on this one
[9:54:57] LittlefootsTreestar: communism Kappa
[9:54:59] letsgetgoingyo: Just raise the voting age to 25 and lots of problems would be solved.
[9:54:59] seksmuhchine: paul vauehouven wrote a book about it
[9:54:59] AmarokUnchained: Vivek xD
[9:55:01] Eran_: @virucs agreed and the answer is no
[9:55:05] NutterCircus: Manipulating a Society becomes easy when there is Corruption.

[9:55:11] virucs: aggre
[9:55:13] happyheals: newly naturalized citizens know way more than the average native born citizen about the way our government works
[9:55:13] craftyz420: Thanks @jarkeler
[9:55:27] happyheals: The U.S. is the only 2 party system in the world
[9:55:28] apacheD: A system is never better than the people in the system
[9:55:29] EmanuShow: In sweden they discussed for a while that they had to learn swedish before becoming citizen
[9:55:32] pappej: People need to understand that policy should be shaped after your will, not objectivity
[9:55:32] fillistv: I would always think its a slippery slope to exclude certain elements of people from  voting
[9:55:34] dwillyjpox: we got 30 million illegal immigrants here that couldn’t even read our constitution.
[9:55:40] Rebukenx: The disease is lobbyism, every single politician is bought and paid for
[9:55:42] NIICKLAS_TV: yo
[9:55:42] gucciwizardd: any system will be gamefied till it stops being useful
[9:55:49] AmarokUnchained: @sortdiff so what?^^
[9:55:54] WhaleBlast: I feel like you are ignoring the wisdom of crowds and the way this concept could be applied better for truthfinding and decisionmaking in democracy
[9:55:55] pappej: BASED
[9:56:01] tyrant002: @dwillyjpox you in a good mood today?
[9:56:13] fr03doc: if they did that, what would be the incentive for leaders to improve parts of society that would fail said test and possibly vote against them?
[9:56:17] shiggydoo43: Vivek was sad, he said ALL the talking points and still it didn't matter because his skin was the wrong colour, he spoke perfectly and said all the right things to appeal to anti-establishment trump fans.
[9:56:18] happyheals: Millions of dead people vote every election
[9:56:18] coeursiy: @happyheals who cares, the people who already live there and whose ancestors build their country will always have more of a claim than some random immigrant
[9:56:19] m0xj3t: free edu
[9:56:20] therivalmo8: theres corruption all throughout our gov on both sides of the isle, thats how it works the corporations line the pockets of who they want to do there dirty work and then they profit and we all get the short straw out of the situation
[9:56:23] virucs: could you make a system that improves people. even long term.
[9:56:29] daijahaden: Actually not true. The systems we create shape the people just as much as people shape the systems.
[9:56:36] Mind_G0bl1n: people get 1 vote for every dollar $
[9:56:36] AustralianFASTbowler: there should be that same IQ test done for breeding and pet ownership TBH
[9:56:40] pappej: @shiggydoo43 You failed the competency test
[9:56:44] alfredraa: If people were competent and aware, Trump would get 0 votes
[9:56:46] gucciwizardd: you need to make sure they have interest in the country doing good
[9:56:47] NutterCircus: The issue is Corruption, everything else goes away if you eliminate it.
[9:56:53] Eran_: @virucs there is such systems alredy, but they are highly unpopular these days
[9:56:56] pappej: Ye big disagree
[9:57:04] fviii: Peggers
[9:57:07] happyheals: @coeursiy just pointing out the ignorance of the average citizen

[9:57:19] gucciwizardd: swedestan??
[9:57:19] shiggydoo43: @pappej vivek did nothing wrong and nobody voted for him because he's brown, he was a perfect talking head saying all the talking points

[9:57:41] drathan249: they are almost there
[9:57:42] coeursiy: @happyheals yes, and the average citizen wouldn't be granted suffrage either, so it's irrelevant. the intent was to demean natives in favor of immigrants knowing more trivia
[9:57:43] pappej: IMAGINE THAT

[9:58:20] pizzagubben1: agree
[9:58:24] Mmmarcoman: I would agree to minimum of 25 for voting age. But I would also limit it to about 75 or so. So many of elderly are just as clueless as teens and youth age, just in a different way clueless and outright stupid
[9:58:25] virucs: @gucciwizardd haha

[10:03:25] daijahaden: I agree with all of that. But that wasn't the point. Some ideas/customs become part of a system due to the culture of the people (like gender equality in Sweden). Others are imposed on a people and only eventually become part of culture (like freedom of expression virtually everywhere).

[10:05:30] shiggydoo43: @StaysafeTV you keep talking in abstract terms how about a real example, would you take away kids from a family and forcibly give them western education and schooling? thats what they do in denmark and many EU countries to combat islamism
[10:05:31] gucciwizardd: they are free to express themselves in prison on their way to deathrow

[10:06:49] coeursiy: @shiggydoo43 byebye
[10:06:53] peepopoope69: if you immigrate to a country with no plans to assimilate, that's an invasion not immigration

[10:07:29] jehina: @shiggydoo43 first off, islamism should be fought, and destroyed. secondly, if they are mistreated at home (for instance taught to hate jews, or not obey laws), social services should take care of the kids.

[10:08:17] coeursiy: @alfredraa where did your family immigrate from
[10:08:20] davy121111: @StaysafeTV imo, if people want to move to another country, they need to provide genuine proof and a desire to assimilate to the new culture they are joining
[10:08:28] daijahaden: A few children were taken away from criminal clans and fundamentalist islamists in Sweden, and boom the muslim world goes wild with it.
[10:08:29] gucciwizardd: iti s not even a conspicy theory it is old policy from 1950 or older
[10:08:32] peepopoope69: @alfredraa america isnt built on immigration, it was built on dominating the natives. then we realized thats shit (even though we could have conquered the world) and agreed not to do that anymore

[10:10:07] AustralianFASTbowler: its funny the ppl who advocate for loose immigration vs strict are actually helping destroy both countries involved. Those highly skilled and intelligent ABDULpls would serve their home country better by remaining and helping the rest of that society fix the home country but instead they move to western nation leaving the other country worse off
[10:10:08] Mind_G0bl1n: but what if your country was promised to my people by ancient scrolls

[10:10:56] Humansoup: Same with the 10yr in Oregon
[10:10:57] studshift: @StaysafeTV in Afghanistan they have little boys auctioned off for village elders and leaders to be their basically sex slaves for their "chai time" which is an ancient honored tradition. In the Army we used to have to let it slide over there due to not wanting to disrespect and it was hard to watch.
[10:11:08] studshift: so fuck you people who say we cant judge them

[10:11:15] unhoLynx_: came for the wow, stayed for the Based
[10:11:16] jehina: just something basic like hitting your children, that is prohibited in Sweden, while in middle east.. not as much.. so if immigrant parents bring their culture to Sweden and think it's OK to hit their children, the social services intervene and take the child into custody.
[10:11:23] ChillyHTX: NotLikeThis they were the next elon

[10:14:53] Eran_: @pappej I wish it was really that easy to do…
[10:14:54] SleepyJerome: the main problem is, that the goal isn't assimilation, they want to make the country as much of a shithole as where they came from
[10:14:59] Vunoka: Right wing cucks who allow assimilation of other cultures and genetics into their are worse than the libtards

[10:15:39] eriksn47: hey dude i got probs with my mouseover dispell macro, healing works but dispell dont ... is there a thing i dont know on dispells or remove curse that i need to put in the macro?

[10:16:40] gucciwizardd: tbh Denmark is not that extreme on imigration anymore those big anti immigration parties dont have much power anymore because everyone agreed with them and basically stole their voters
[10:16:45] pezs1234: Im Hungarian and the problem is not immigration here, trust me - the problem is that "no one guards the guards" if you know what I mean
[10:16:49] daijahaden: It's easy really. People from countries who have too many children are flooding to countries where people have too few, replacing the latter in the process. Either we stop it, or western civilisation dies.

[10:17:58] Vunoka: @gucciwizardd The right wing in denmark is a bunch of cuckolds, wishing for their women to get impregnated and ruined by immigrants, just a bit slower than the left in denmark. Entire political landscape of Europe is cuckolding, just to varying degrees.
[10:18:01] letsgetgoingyo: @SammieKK and why should we be okay with that? Oh someone who share my skincolor did something bad, so we must suicide our civilization now? nah.

[10:18:19] fviii: @fviii ich liebe dich
[10:18:20] daijahaden: @SammieKK Horseshit. If you want to blame the west for all it's ills, then you also have to give it credit for all it's "gifts". Just the invention and spread of antibiotics has saved more people than westerners ever killed.
[10:18:34] coeursiy: access to whitepeopleHappy is not a human right!

[10:18:48] pappej: access to whitepeopleHappy is not a human right!
[10:18:48] joepera: The part that I never understand is how you leave your country due to the political system, no opportunities, violence, etc, then go to another country looking for change but try to implement the same culture you are running from. Is retarded.
[10:18:52] SammieKK: Not talking about killing
[10:18:53] gucciwizardd: dickhands on keyboard
[10:18:54] SleepyJerome: whitepeopleHappy
[10:18:54] alfredraa: @AmarokUnchained Well In my opinion people should be able to be whatever gender they like... As there is a major difference between social gender and sex... Still not quite sure what you are talking about. But in my opinion LGBTQ+ rights are the same as human rights, and you are not allowed to neglect. So I'd agree, you have to accept Transgenderisme and multiple sexual orientations if you wanna be a paren
