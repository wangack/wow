[6:42:40] Interzention: ww feels sleeper rn
[6:43:45] prolyphicttv: DH nerfs are solid, but i feel like the bigger issues are their immuning damage / CC with glimpse and metaform, omnidirectional dodge with blur, netherwalk (another immune), and their leech. the dmg nerfs they are getting are good, but arent enough to drop them from S tier imo

[6:53:43] honsou2: Sean vs Chito was like a 1v1 between DH and DK

[6:58:45] prolyphicttv: @honsou2 they are good for sure, not saying they arent. however they will still pump

[7:01:31] prolyphicttv: looking at the numbers overall, you're just going to see like 20k-30k dmg less from DHs
[7:01:45] prolyphicttv: so instead of 300k+ essence break goes...itll be 270k
[7:02:15] prolyphicttv: theyll still do 700k dmg in 1.5-2 seconds with EB, Death sweeps , annihilation  etc
[7:02:31] Guelag: a mongloid class S tier all xpac while feral still unplayable. ggs
[7:02:51] prolyphicttv: @Guelag enhancement shamans say hello too
[7:02:59] honsou2: @prolyphicttv thats fine tbh. In s1 what made them fall off was not the nerfs to EB/death sweep. It was when they nerfed the passive dot, which is still a way too big part of their dmg in s3
[7:03:03] prolyphicttv: oh and frost dks outside of the cheese FDK/Devoker comps
[7:03:07] Guelag: oh that too yeah
[7:03:24] prolyphicttv: @honsou2 100% agreed, my main issue with DH isnt even their dmg tbh
[7:03:55] prolyphicttv: it's the fact they have baked in passives as well as being able to immune so much via glimpse, netherwalk, metaform animation
[7:04:28] prolyphicttv: DH was best when it was a hit and run spec, current iteration they just full int and use abilities on CD and win
[7:05:10] prolyphicttv: good lord he got deleted
