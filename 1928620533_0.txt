[1:14:03] fcsgamer: Sounds like a bronze dragonflight questline
[1:14:11] zysmos: that's genius
[1:14:15] onikid89: he marries anduin D:

[1:14:59] Nlvez: Jeez whats the mic you use.. it sounds so crisp
[1:15:46] valianya: Varian is the starting zone raid boss lurking with his band of thieving murderous knights outside Gnollwind's civilized walls
[1:15:54] Eshel: Nah - Anduin is tagging Sylvanas - she’s coming back as queen of Stormwind just to make peoples heads explode on both sides lmao

[1:19:43] onikid89: work is work.. free time is free time :D
[1:19:57] zysmos: it's like bellular making super negative content and being surprised people don't watch his non lore content anymore
[1:20:14] Eshel: Disagreements among friends is how we all learn from each other
[1:21:08] onikid89: people expect too much from small patches
[1:21:51] wertywaz: @Towelliee do you think there's also a bit of additional bias here because he's cultivated an audience of ex-WoW players who hate WoW

[1:22:58] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee you are correct conceptually.  but... shitting on anything is no way to move anything forward.
[1:23:11] Eshel: And that then becomes an echo chamber
[1:23:38] zysmos: dude cultivated an audience of people who hate blizzard no shot people that actually like the game won't watch his shit

[1:23:58] Aidler: the only worrying thing would be if critical videos about wow attract more viewers than positive videos but who really knows that
[1:24:08] onikid89: i still enjoy the game
[1:24:15] strike879: those negative vids are viewed by ppl that quit so they feel they did good by quiting
[1:24:31] stratiss: the video isn
[1:25:00] herzlustafir: last video feelt like he was out of wow news to talk about. and it has been alot of speculations on there lateley
[1:25:09] Eshel: People who don’t like WoW will search out others to validate them (this goes for a LOT of things)
[1:25:16] stratiss: the video isn't really all that negative just talks about the story being a bit weak and speculating why players aren't returning in droves
[1:25:21] valianya: @towelliee But I also think if all the biggest names in the community only post negative content it skews the algorithm and the audience toward negative content because that's what pops up first on searches and the names most widely known as experts in the community
[1:25:27] herzlustafir: its view fishing for sure
[1:25:41] stratiss: speculating****
[1:26:09] Talason: i thought he did some armory calculations or something
[1:26:09] svyxia: Obviously feelings = facts
[1:26:11] stratiss: well we have evidence from mythic +, raid, pvp participation from 3rd party websites
[1:26:19] Wcvechten: ''Well, my friendslist isn't more active, so that must  mean nobody is returning''
[1:26:23] Eshel: Haters gonna hate
[1:26:31] i_flip_whales: All the negative vids are bait titles too. People search out positive videos but then their algorithm shows those damn bait click titles where you click out of curiosity and get a non-answer

[1:27:15] strike879: dont most ppl skip the story line anyway? like quest skip skip go wowhead where are the mobs i need to kill
[1:27:50] ronny_84: ive flat out stopped watching some creatores because all they did for a year straight every week releasing just negative talk about WoW and assuming everyone felt the same way
[1:27:59] ronny_84: after a while the negativity was just too draining
[1:28:13] nox503: mehdiHEY
[1:28:15] Syllvn: @biggyronny I did the same.
[1:28:37] strike879: didnt know panda still played wow i though he couldnt because he F ed his hands from boxing in his youth
[1:29:04] nox503: streams every day usually
[1:29:41] valianya: @towelliee  They don't do searches for hate, but if searches for anything WoW turn up big community names first in algorithm because they have most viewers, and if their content is negative it skews future searches toward showing negative content has more viewers
[1:29:49] Aidler: I haven’t watched a Belluar video for years… also nothing personal of course
[1:30:10] Navaeir: being negative drives more engagement lol
[1:30:11] strike879: yup ppl shitted so hard on garrison blizz is still scared to do something housing related

[1:30:39] herzlustafir: dragons dude.. dragons
[1:30:42] reggiepowa: true
[1:30:52] nox503: have played more this expansion regularly than i did the last couple
[1:30:57] Exusprime: HUH Blizzard scared to do anything. I dunno about that. They spent many expansions putting out shit systems, thats on them
[1:31:00] ronny_84: Panda is 1000000000000000000000000% right!!
[1:31:07] herzlustafir: same here
[1:31:12] shadowgrove88: why should it be hard to gear alts tho when ur mian is maxed out
[1:31:18] Sinanzii: flying dragon dude Kappa
[1:31:21] Flebboo: that i don't agree with, i prefer the easier/alt catch up gear now. Tho i agree i having something to work towards outside of that feels a little lacking
[1:31:53] Aidler: @biggyronny can you spell out that number? just kidding…. LUL
[1:31:53] ashwing_: I mean he said the way the dragons look is not dangerous enough??? KEKW
[1:31:56] Navaeir: just make bettter systems then 4Head
[1:31:57] erageK: damn thats panda?he lost a ton of weight good on him man <3
[1:32:24] nzxterd: Panda has always been a Blizz fanboi
[1:32:26] Exusprime: hold on, thats not right. they give up on systems because they are seasoonal. They fully intend n dumping systems
[1:32:38] Eshel: And when people support WoW - those same people like to throw out the word “fanboy” - like it’s a bad thing to be a fan of something you enjoy smfh
[1:32:39] reggiepowa: they weren't scared until df but they are now
[1:33:04] Exusprime: facts
[1:33:13] valianya: Dragonriding, removing daily grind, support specs, gear upgrading
[1:33:18] strike879: gearing is easy for streamers
[1:33:31] valianya: All experimental
[1:33:35] ashwing_: Bellular and his followers all want nostalgia but they also want new stuff? Like what you want new content in Ashenvale every expanison or what?
[1:33:37] herzlustafir: never went this deep in a expantion before.. look at the zones.. its amazing... Valdrakken is a good idea to.. its just the bad guys we are used to face. we just have to have something nice to do to.. not just hunt evil villans... all the time.. lets just enjoy what we have for a while right..
[1:33:52] Keyastaron_: isnt most top end guilds stream WoW for a living tho?
[1:33:56] Wcvechten: gearing is just a tad /too/ good right now, so I think going back a bit as they do for 10.2 is fine
[1:34:33] Breakernaut: They wouldn't continue to be a top MMO if they were afraid to try things out. They also have to make it accesible for people that was the whole point in the begining it wasn't AS grindy as Everquest
[1:34:53] templarofboingo: Does that include wrath classic though that was extremely popular and at the same time. Disclaimer this is only a question lol
[1:35:30] RegulusCaelum: I just want them to stop changing classes every 3 months, its really hard choosing a main when they change the way they play so much
[1:35:45] Eshel: And that’s the thing - people drop all these opinions as facts without access to the internal numbers that Blizz looks at
[1:35:46] Aidler: I know Blizz has experience but numbers are misleading and in a long running game like wow they also have to consider societal changes
[1:36:07] reggiepowa: not easy to play but gearing is definitely too fast in 10.1, we will see if 10.2 changes help with that
[1:36:15] Flebboo: i wouldn't be playing my alts rn if it wasn't cause of the easy gearing, its great
[1:36:33] ronny_84: i dont know.. participation rewards arent always good
[1:36:47] Wcvechten: They tried Shadowlands though, don't forget Kappa

[1:39:52] PadidinJones: Dont go into the cave!! Choose life!
[1:39:52] strike879: the thing i didnt like about shadowlands it felt more like 5 patch zones instead of 1 big expansion zone at launch
[1:40:01] Flebboo: Same with Asmon
[1:40:11] valianya: Blizzard makes way more money on retained subs than box sales
[1:40:57] Breakernaut: Blizzard's best customers are the ones not playing ;)

[1:51:32] Breakernaut: I think Blizzard overall does a good job at making the game for the upper 20-30% honestly I don't think they cater to the 1% or the 99% exclusively.
[1:51:40] Rudric_Ice: i just want that grittiness and the savageness of warcraft back like back from the old times dragonflight took a full 360 from that and im just not a fan of it

[2:22:21] theviperleet: @Towelliee i mean it in the nicest way possible asking this and feel free to not answer but is there loose skin?
[2:24:28] NickLeonhearth: it's a "at home t-shirt" now :D
[2:24:57] Ovium56: feel that. i've lost about 20lbs in the past 2 months or so and even though most clothes don't fit anymore, still like wearing them lol
[2:25:53] theviperleet: im currently 250, started at 270ish and im going for 190 hopefully in till the end of the year, and im afraid af from loose skin happening @Towelliee
[2:26:17] inbedwithEd: still feelsgood man
[2:27:03] Xronik07: smoke weed
[2:27:04] falldrgn: I work out a bit.. bit but my diet still sucks
[2:27:32] Ovium56: @theviperleet if you take it at a moderate pace and workout, you can slow it and avoid it. lose skin usually comes when someone drops a ton of weight way too fast. gotta let the body heal when losing weight too
[2:28:47] theviperleet: @Ovium56 well im purely doing jim and food, not alot of cardio, i do jump ropes and boxing for cardio, just for the purpose of losing weight in trade of muscle

[2:31:14] abracka_: mamma mia, wow token up to 344k this morning
[2:31:44] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee My wife was using Ozempic, was an excellent thing for her.  But insurance decided they didn't want to approve anymore.  Now she can't get any variant, other than out of pocket.  And it is not affordable.
[2:31:53] Noshpan: Same thing happened to my uncle when he had gastric bypass.
[2:32:02] zysmos: yeah weight loss is not rocket science at the end of the day you've got to create a calories deficit
[2:32:24] Ovium56: yeah all about eating right and finding balance. big thing that's helped me is finding way better for you alternatives to some of the junk not good for you stuff
[2:32:27] Brodih_: overlay @Towelliee
[2:32:27] Noshpan: He didn't stick to dietary changes to help him lose weight. And once he was able to eat solid foods, he gained the weight back plus more.
[2:32:48] abracka_: just picked up a few to re up, absolute insanity and i'm loving it
[2:33:06] cynical_effect12: why are you in this weird view mode
[2:33:16] macleod29: Just sold 3 on stormrage yesterday sold for 334k
[2:34:06] Ribbheden: Sloot quit WoW?
[2:34:19] dilemma90: Anyone
[2:34:48] Aidler: is Sloot at least continuing to casually play WoW or is this a all or nothing situation?
[2:34:48] dilemma90: No one is retired... sorry guys
[2:34:54] theviperleet: why did he quit?
[2:34:56] Effin_Steffin: when you get that wow itch man..
[2:35:09] macleod29: What are you excited for in 10.2 I haven’t had a chance to look up what’s coming
[2:35:23] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[2:35:56] Aidler: so when it comes to WoW he actually is a “all or nothing” guy

[2:36:59] Freeks417: Is the game not fullscreen on purpose? Just checking
[2:37:01] macleod29: I read the Ian interview where he was saying they wanna implement the old zones back into retail like cata
[2:37:06] Alepouditsa: ohh then he must be playing Lies off P danS
[2:37:16] Shrenko: you have the overlay up BBYodaS
[2:37:37] Brodih_: yeah when Future disbanded and he took those weeks off streaming right after
[2:37:49] ArcaneMaki: Lies of P is so good
[2:38:42] Alepouditsa: yes
[2:38:42] ArcaneMaki: yes
[2:39:16] mavericks312: The Pinocchio souls game is pretty cool
[2:39:21] abracka_: lux was just talking about only playing sea of stars on his second channel because of the viewership
[2:39:22] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:39:31] Shrenko: especially if you build up your stream and community based off one game
[2:39:57] Molvonos: Definitely.  People have games they enjoy watching, so if they're looking for new viewers, if you switch games they'll leave and go to another streamer that's playing the game they actually wanna watch.
[2:40:11] Molvonos: It's not until you solidify that viewer as someone who likes watching you for you, versus the game
[2:40:26] TweektheProphet: i think also trying to chase the trend would be hard as well
[2:40:31] memnon94: true, for example I love Cohh, but I don't watch him often because I don't like the games he is playing with
[2:40:37] TheGiant99: good morning squad
[2:40:49] Shrenko: watch out for the horde patrol here @Towelliee
[2:41:27] Navaeir: I feel like a lot of only MMO streamers have a big issue with playing something else entirely based on viewership.. even though they are most likely not having fun but they are feeling forced to do it
[2:41:30] tas4prez: !lurk
[2:41:45] TheGiant99: Cohh can make any game fun to watych
[2:42:00] Wcvechten: I hope you play the old sub sunday intro video for it
[2:42:01] TheGiant99: Sub Sunday was awesome back in the day
[2:42:32] MedicineMan: Morning, Mr. @Towelliee
[2:42:34] TheHardcorian: Soda's done the variety transition  the best imo
[2:42:36] Alepouditsa: it is a way to dicover new games to, like i love fae farm it was beter then i expected
[2:42:41] Rudric_Ice: if the streamer is fun to watch he can play any game he wants just like LIRIK
[2:42:45] Brodih_: I'm not a fan of Cohh doing re-runs when hes off now,  hes succesfull and those viewers could be watching someone else... my 2 cents
[2:42:53] KaisenSiru: Horror Pog

[2:43:40] Molvonos: Gnomer-regan
[2:43:47] Alepouditsa: i love horror and the funny part is i never play horror game i only watch danKEK2
[2:43:48] DunzoCD: @Brodih_ isnt it on his other channel too?

[2:43:51] Navaeir: on his 2nd channel
[2:43:53] Navaeir: while on lunch
[2:43:58] Exitarnium: He plays vods on his alt channel
[2:44:11] DunzoCD: he just plays vods on lunch between streams
[2:44:12] Navaeir: he has an alt channel
[2:44:13] Molvonos: I mean, if people wanna watch the reruns, that's not on Cohh.
[2:44:15] Navaeir: just "cohh"
[2:44:16] Exitarnium: Cohh has an alt channel called Cohh
[2:44:20] Navaeir: yeah like 1 or 2 hours
[2:44:24] Molvonos: Putting the fault on him is weird as heck.
[2:44:35] Navaeir: no, just when he's on a break
[2:44:41] Wcvechten: Evil Cohh be like
[2:44:42] LehBiscuit: He puts the channel up when he takes his lunch break
[2:44:59] Lobby_WoW: if users choose to watch a re-run vs a live streamer how is that on the streamer?
[2:45:20] Navaeir: he mainly does this so people know when he's on lunch and when he will come back..
[2:45:38] Exitarnium: @Lobby_WoW Ikr
[2:45:42] Manse06: If Cohh can retain a percentage of his morning viewers in the morning, through to his afternoon stream using vods as a bridge, then fair play to him
[2:46:00] Alepouditsa: usely if the streamer i watch is puting a vod i will be lurking and watching something live
[2:46:06] DunzoCD: he had a whole video saying the reason he was doing it was because of twitch trying to average his morning and night viewers, at least hes up front about it
[2:46:41] Navaeir: yeah, I don't like how people seem to somehow comment on stuff like this but not providing all the facts and reason why he does this
[2:46:56] Navaeir: he exclusively only does this when he's out for a lunch break for like an hour or two..
[2:47:00] TwiztedG: TwiztedG subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Yo gm toweliee
[2:47:05] Navaeir: you're free to watch someone else lmao
[2:47:12] Molvonos: I mean, let's put it this way: if I were watching Cohh, because of a game he's playing, and he puts up a vod and I'm not a fan of it, if the other 'less successful streamers' aren't interesting to me, I'm not gonna magically watch them.
[2:47:27] Molvonos: He's not taking anyone away from a 'less successful streamer'.

[2:47:51] DunzoCD: yeah he said twitch was trying to give him a smaller contract because his night chill streams are smaller than his main streams

[2:55:49] izabeL: Same here in Canada. When you make over 110k you pay tons of taxes but at least it's helping other people less fortunates.

[3:11:49] DunzoCD: I couldnt imagine stopping watching somebody for a shallow reason like that, you watch someone for their personality
[3:11:57] smokesboys: Funny enough the guy who told me about you streaming stopped watching you when you stopped drinking on stream, because it was a reminder to him that he was drinking too much and needed to quit

[3:44:50] Clicklesly: Then again if they ever do come to you with a big contract, they could easily give you your name too ^^
[3:45:09] RaituTV: I never really asked but is Towelliee based on the Towel in South park?

[3:56:17] Yagr6: well ele is currently ignoring their 4pc all together so yea alot of specs need changes
[3:56:22] abracka_: @Strifelol my wallet has waited a long time for this KEKW
[3:56:39] Sicknessqt: @Strifelol  Yall finally hitting eu prices LUL
[3:57:21] Strifelol: LUL
[3:57:22] Sollice: Morning
[3:57:35] raldrik: nothing else to spend gold on
[3:57:36] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:57:37] Verdell263: Lower supply
[3:57:43] ashwing_: Tendie bundles LUL
[3:57:44] Sicknessqt: People dont need alot of gold rn so less ppl buying tokens
[3:57:45] DunzoCD: idk but i actually bought one cuz thats crazy LUL
[3:57:47] Strifelol: Demand
[3:57:48] Wcvechten: They had sales too recently right
[3:57:54] Mecabeast: I think it is cuz of t3 farmers
[3:57:56] Shrenko: 350k? its only 390k EU it used to be a huge gap between the two
[3:58:02] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[3:58:02] Aidler: normally the token is where Blizz wants it to be
[3:58:10] kalamari__: maybe buying stuff in D4?
[3:58:15] Dark_Kornax: Selling runs for gold is off the wall.  and people aren't making the amount of gold they charge
[3:58:15] TacDuc: Yeah, standard EU prices
[3:58:23] zysmos: EU is 390k right now
[3:58:30] kalamari__: I bought th 90 € version of D4 with tokens only
[3:58:34] zysmos: bonkers
[3:58:36] ZooNamiii: no more gold sinks ... gold devalued
[3:59:00] twinkletips: eu has been just over 400k then drops to 385 most days
[3:59:01] Sicknessqt: @kalamari__  Farmed 6 months sub in a week LUL
[3:59:08] Yagr6: i think it has to do with the leveling boosts being so easy
[3:59:11] Shrenko: only gold sink going on right now is pretty much the tier 3 sets
[3:59:13] Yagr6: to buy with gold
[3:59:16] ConductiFlax: 388k for the token on EU.
[3:59:19] Heero_Effect: Need a new “AH mount” like maybe a dragon or something
[3:59:20] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the 10.2 Raid Fights Overview | https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ47ecb6VwPnA53-5r0iEtP5lEyY0HE2m
[3:59:21] Molvonos: I'd drop a hundo to get that mount again.
[3:59:32] Roadskii: I know I am stting at almost 42 mil lol
[3:59:32] TheZofren: My guess: more casual players with less gold want to buy tokens, more competitive players with more gold taking a break until next tier
[3:59:41] kalamari__: @Sicknessqt yeah, making money is DF is stupid easy
[3:59:45] ZooNamiii: tcg mounts use to be BIG gold sinks
[4:00:03] Aidler: a constant emerald helper pet for 1 million LUL
[4:00:06] zysmos: i only have 3 million gold can't buy the AH mount
[4:00:20] Aidler: or 10 million
[4:00:31] Shrenko: how the fuq do you get that xD
[4:00:33] dr_james_: dport4short subscribed with Prime. 
[4:00:36] Yagr6: mining was so good this expansion
[4:00:39] Sicknessqt: Draconic rune is huge money maker in DF
[4:00:40] Heero_Effect: I have like 1 million but I’m not subbed right now
[4:01:34] Molvonos: I wonder if that's what the helm enchant thing is on the PTR
[4:01:35] Mecabeast: I have like 200k but I have touched retail wow in like 2mos just been playing wotlk
[4:01:41] Molvonos: If they're trying that instead.
[4:01:44] TheZofren: do you think there will be a fourth raid tier in dragonflight?
[4:01:46] abracka_: the wotlk to retail swap ratio is like, 1:50. you could just run GDKPs every week in wotlk for TOGC, takes like 1hr to do and you walk out with between 5-10k gold you can swap to retail

[4:02:22] NobodybetterPat: Goodmorning friends
[4:02:22] Molvonos: They might do a Fated Raid system.
[4:02:22] ronny_84: what about like a mini 3 to 5 boss raid
[4:02:26] Aidler: 1 boss raid maybe?
[4:02:29] Molvonos: But not a full blown extra raid tier.
[4:02:45] snake_like: if they don't do a perma rune they could make another flavor pocket embellishment for augment rune

[4:03:00] mavericks312: Think we have some max viewers in here lol
[4:03:05] kerchuu: classic+ maybe? ;o
[4:03:17] ronny_84: just feels like a very long time going from december 2023 to abot oct - nov 2024 with no new/dungeon content
[4:03:19] Aidler: @molvonos I’d bet money on that coming back. maybe with another name
[4:03:26] llNoTToXiCll: hope the warrior does good in dm
[4:03:33] TheZofren: just seems strange to have 3 raids in the first year of the expac then 0 raids in the second year
[4:03:34] llNoTToXiCll: pali
[4:03:35] llNoTToXiCll: sorry
[4:03:36] abracka_: "see? i was right all along"
[4:03:50] NobodybetterPat: Lol
[4:03:51] Sicknessqt: Tbf unless iridikron comes back there is not much left this xpack for another raid
[4:03:57] Yagr6: think about it, new patch coming out new tier sets new specs becoming meta so people buy token for gold for the ez leveling boosts
[4:04:02] Sollice: You will have content release in 10.2.5
[4:04:04] JQ47: It does feel weird they wouldn't say it's the last raid right?
[4:04:24] Molvonos: @Aidler Oh definitely.  I believe it'll be 'dream' related.
[4:04:26] PadidinJones: @Towelliee knows!!
[4:04:27] abracka_: iridikron be cookin'

[4:04:58] OhChano: They are gonna just leave Iridikron out of the lore lmao
[4:05:01] luckfore: as if you would know 4Head
[4:05:03] Molvonos: @KaisenSiru That means absolutely nothing for current systems.
[4:05:07] Crowargus: i dont think theres time for a new raid tbh alpha porbs end dec jan beta is like 6-8 months and you still have dinar patch
[4:05:13] stresstest: Fated Raids , 10.3
[4:05:13] mavericks312: Max is setting y’all up for disappointment
[4:05:16] vannie_h: is this the newest wow version?
[4:05:25] Molvonos: @OhChano Uh, no.  He's gonna be the baddie, or one of them, for the next expansion.  C'mon.
[4:05:26] snake_like: I'd be fine with 10.3 just being a dinar/timewalking raid season
[4:05:46] ScaarTv: if someone wants to play a bit of classic to have have which one should i go for wotlk or classic
[4:05:46] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[4:05:58] luckfore: hope so, dont like df so hope they spend their resources on 11.0
[4:06:28] Necrothia: Easy 15 to 20 silver right there
[4:06:29] KaisenSiru: @Molvonos Did I say it was? No. Every expansion cycle plans differ.
[4:06:29] Heero_Effect: @scaartv i think classic is the most alive ? I could be wrong
[4:07:06] TheZofren: imo it's a really bad idea to pace expansions with a year long raid drought each time
[4:07:16] mavericks312: With how successful DF was I expect the same stuff moving forward
[4:07:26] ScaarTv: @Heero_Effect thanks mate
[4:07:32] kerchuu: fated raids was a fantastic idea honestly
[4:07:34] Sicknessqt: I want something new to do in wow
[4:07:43] OhChano: Im guessing the 10.3 will be like at the end of last expac with the same raids just fated
[4:07:44] snake_like: as much as people hate on cata I miss that initial raid feast we had. gone are those days
[4:07:46] TacDuc: It just feels like a very short expansion compared to legion/BfA, and it is even 10 euro more expensive than those
[4:07:47] Sollice: @KaisenSiru I think DF is their pacing moving forward.
[4:07:53] Ezionn: Where can I see your level with that UI ?
[4:07:53] ronny_84: no because everyone was off playing ff14 lol
[4:07:53] Mecabeast: A 10.3 with a dinar system would be interesting gearing wise
[4:08:01] Sollice: Thats what they have stated DF is their new model for content cadence
[4:08:09] Shrenko: is there a way to reset the vault doors in Forbidden reach or do you have to wait for reset?
[4:08:16] Ezionn: Arh lvl 17, got it
[4:08:52] Sicknessqt: One of those small patches added Trading post which is very good perma feature for wow
[4:08:55] Sollice: Would be cool to have like a single boss before the expansion come sout...herald of the void or something and that , if there is one, gave you your item ( cloak, necklace ) or whatever system to start 11.0
[4:09:14] DunzoCD: @Shrenko it resets every week with a new layout
[4:09:35] Strifelol: Play another game
[4:09:40] Strifelol: Go hone on Lost Ark
[4:09:40] Shrenko: there is so much to do in DF
[4:09:42] Strifelol: LUUL
[4:09:43] mavericks312: Sun rentention alone tells you the new model is good
[4:09:48] Shrenko: Im literally farming 10 things at the same time
[4:09:53] NobodybetterPat: Why do people want to invalidate there gear 5 times an expaanaion? Lol
[4:09:57] Delkamus04: Solid pacing, hope they keep it up
[4:10:03] Sollice: Go play OW2 or D4 if your not playing WoW :P
[4:10:10] Heero_Effect: @strifelol danLurk
[4:10:26] Sollice: Thats correct. Consistency keeps your sub
[4:10:26] KaisenSiru: Consistency Pog
[4:10:30] metr0_ttv: blizzard won't push new content so now I have 6 alts /s
[4:10:33] Sollice: 6 months between shit people are going to unsub
[4:10:48] DunzoCD: WoW about to add another AH mount to gold sink with the token being this high
[4:10:59] ronny_84: think they would ever do 10 man mythic raiding ?
[4:10:59] Shrenko: I think Dragonflight is my most played expansion so far
[4:11:19] raldrik: that would drop the price of the wow token
[4:11:35] Mecabeast: Imagine if they added a bank mount
[4:11:43] mavericks312: For the average player there is no way DF isn’t in your top 3
[4:11:49] Rudric_Ice: its ok boys u dont have to play blizzard games u wont die look at me i bought MK1 for PC it was shit and i refunded it and bought lies of P and im having fun
[4:12:21] Sollice: @Rudric_Ice Just think you could have spent 9.99 and gotten Lies of P
[4:12:24] mavericks312: @rudric_ice your high mk1 is lit
[4:12:26] SmallzzIV: is there a release day on 10.2?
[4:12:43] Rudric_Ice: @mavericks312 PC port is garbage

[4:16:29] abracka_: sword stays until sargeras returns with illidan so we can fuck up knifu and iridikron
[4:16:29] Sollice: He left the sword there so when he had to come back he had a weapon to fight the void with
[4:16:31] Verdell263: This is not the sword you're looking for

[4:20:36] kerchuu: only hope yall got of arthas is classic+ kek
[4:20:38] Strifelol: There ain't no way coming back from that lol
[4:20:39] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice Funny assumption to make.
[4:20:52] Molvonos: I owned every single Blizz game since Rock and Roll Racing.
[4:20:57] Molvonos: But didnt play WC3.
[4:20:58] Molvonos: Hmm.
[4:21:04] Sollice: @Rudric_Ice How is that Ubi job coming along. When you moving to france
[4:21:24] kerchuu: leave sylv to her maw dailies
[4:21:24] Eviltuna13: Arthas come back for 1 scene and makes Forsaken paladins
[4:21:28] essadis: lightlands here we come
[4:21:33] Rudric_Ice: @Sollice pretty close just waiting on the visa stuff
[4:21:43] Heero_Effect: I could see shadowlands if there is a tie to Elune.
[4:21:44] essadis: he super dead
[4:21:44] NobodybetterPat: The jailer returns electric bugaloo
[4:21:46] Sollice: towClap

[4:22:04] MattyNiceTV: oh wildstar...
[4:22:05] kerchuu: rip wildstar
[4:22:10] Rudric_Ice: @Sollice but the tax is so high lol
[4:22:11] JQ47: No one will be able to convince me that the Primus isn't still the bad guy of the shadow lands and we just help him
[4:22:17] ronny_84: shadowlands wasnt that bad.. the dungeons were really good!!
[4:22:18] essadis: oh man...wildstar dead.  i understand now
[4:22:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: until the multiverse expansion
[4:22:37] Sollice: I think they are done with Shadowlands
[4:22:40] Molvonos: We killed Arthas, we killed Ner'zhul.  Every aspect of the Lich King is gone.
[4:22:40] Strifelol: Yep he's as gone as Varian is, both got turned into dust lol
[4:22:40] Noshpan: Warhammer Online dead. Most-Likely-To-Be-Unity dead.
[4:22:45] Sollice: No one would really be happy to go backwards
[4:23:03] abracka_: the whole primus is the bad guy is just copium of people wanting the SL story to be better
[4:23:07] Sollice: I think the only thing that people would be happy about coming back out of SL would be Daddy D
[4:23:11] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos but Kelthuzad is alive right ?
[4:23:13] abracka_: it's nothingness and nonsense
[4:23:17] Flebboo: Still mad the primus turned the helm of domination into a Burger king crown
[4:23:30] essadis: BFA and Shadowlands was kind of a blur to me. i played both but, stopped shortly have the story and running dungeons
[4:23:32] cipusanx: everything back then would have been better than what we got
[4:23:38] bypized: Classic Awakening is coming @Towelliee KEKW
[4:23:40] essadis: after the story*
[4:23:41] herzlustafir: pokemon go?
[4:23:41] cipusanx: any theory
[4:23:52] Eviltuna13: The biggest WTF moment is when we went to Mist and all these Pandas living in peace and harmony and we go start a war and release the Sha sacJAM
[4:23:54] Aro725: i have 0 clue about current lore. not forcing me to do the campaign has left me fucking clueless
[4:24:10] Rudric_Ice: did u see the wow classic + leak on 4chan ? i mean its 4chan but
[4:24:15] Davedaman26: what if Thrall is the true bad guy WutFace NotLikeThis
[4:24:18] bypized: They know about Wow 2
[4:24:26] Flebboo: A cosmos divided NotLikeThis
[4:24:39] FresheFefe: is the jailer dead?
[4:25:05] Sollice: Titans are just like eternals
[4:25:07] FresheFefe: or in rehab?
[4:25:08] Sollice: Its the same story
[4:25:23] Rudric_Ice: they made elune an idiot
[4:25:32] DunzoCD: Sargeras did nothing wrong!
[4:25:40] Tamis2Hamis: Blanchy is hungry :(
[4:25:45] cipusanx: `the jailer was more or less a robot. the question is, is his datacore still useable
[4:25:48] essadis: Titan race inc?
[4:25:48] Sollice: Eternals grow babies on planets, create and let life on them to feed the eternal soul on it, and then let the planet die so a new eternal can be born
[4:26:04] Sollice: Sounds like the Titans do the same thing
[4:26:19] Wcvechten: Jailer went to the even shadowierlands and subject to punishment by The Imprisoner in The Gape
[4:26:19] Molvonos: Copium
[4:26:23] bypized: Sounds like plot armor behind plot armor behind plot armor KEKW
[4:26:46] TacDuc: 4 years I think
[4:26:47] abracka_: several years i think
[4:26:48] laeenaravenholdt: We need another Nobbel and Towelliee conversation.
[4:27:00] cipusanx: `5 years i think
[4:27:00] ronny_84: for all those hoping for WoW 2.. Dragonflight essentially is WoW 2
[4:27:04] luckfore: oh we will never forget
[4:27:04] killerteapotsftw: we will never forget that mess :D
[4:27:05] Exitarnium: Was a couple of years atleast, iirc it was like 3-4
[4:27:05] Raidr211: they all but deleted it from leveling now also.
[4:27:08] DunzoCD: what Shadowlands?
[4:27:08] Davedaman26: thought it was like 20
[4:27:11] valianya: 3 years
[4:27:12] Flebboo: Apperently the wild hunt from Ardenweald are in the Dream next patch
[4:27:14] Rudric_Ice: i would really love if ion just came out and said shadowlands was not cannon storywise
[4:27:18] Sollice: Why would we even need a wow 2
[4:27:21] yib_: shadowlands? never heard of it ratirlSmug
[4:27:21] Bayne77: um.  well where malfurion and ysera switch places?
[4:27:48] mavericks312: Best part of shadowlands was it got rid of arthas for good
[4:27:54] Mellottman: I want a questline where we get to attend the horde elf leaders wedding
[4:27:55] Davedaman26: according to some dialog from some of the npc before that elemental event before DF released
[4:28:04] Molvonos: I mean, it makes sense that there isn't much Shadowlands influence in Dragonflight, since canonitically, people in the Shadowlands can't leave them easily.  Denathrius kinda cheesed the system to get his Dreadlords out, but beyond that?
[4:28:14] valianya: Sylvanas made brief apologetic appearance in Forsaken heritage if you are loyalist simp
[4:28:21] Eviltuna13: Shadowlands had some good mog
[4:28:22] DunzoCD: Illidan can come save the day Kappa
[4:28:32] vortine: yo
[4:28:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: sylvanus shows up with a broom and dustpan declaring she is done cleaning
[4:28:53] mavericks312: Baevanas did nothing wrong
[4:28:53] Rudric_Ice: can we kill sylvanas ?
[4:28:54] Sollice: Sylvans will come back for next expansion. Hasn't she worked with Knifu before so she will have "inside info"
[4:29:24] VarlBGem: I wish they'd get rid of that targeting gray shit everywhere. What's the point of it?

[4:30:32] DunzoCD: Xalatath the pirate captain Kappa

[4:30:41] abracka_: i just want that cinematic for the next xpac to play out with illidan landing on the ground hero landing style with sargeras appearing behind him
[4:30:42] Valcrone: on top of him? towNut1
[4:30:48] Mellottman: On top of him b1kEZ b1kSweat
[4:30:48] abracka_: i will fucking lose my mind if that happens
[4:31:11] Rudric_Ice: let azshara join the alliance and give us naga
[4:31:22] Sicknessqt: Titans = illidans return
[4:32:19] DunzoCD: i think theres a possibility to set up for next xpac Illidan comes to help us in this raid and the titans get baited down for the xpac
[4:32:29] TheZofren: illidan = break glass in case of falling subs
[4:32:31] Strifelol: I've been playing WoW long enough to know that every "bad guy" is always a pawn to something bigger, rinse and repeat lol
[4:32:39] Heero_Effect: @rudric_ice nah they are gross, they are a horse race

[4:33:22] kyrph819: illititan
[4:33:25] Sollice: I think Sargeras is going to lay down what Titans do to Illidan
[4:33:27] cipusanx: `that would ruin his character for me
[4:33:29] chukudu: tight illidan ? Kreygasm
[4:33:30] Panadol324: its 99% sure he will take sargeras place after he kills him
[4:33:34] TacDuc: How would that even work? Illidan eating a Titan Soul to become one?
[4:33:34] Noshpan: Better than being Sargeras' toenail clippers
[4:33:39] ninetynil: ninetynil subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 93 months, currently on a 93 month streak! 
[4:33:40] DunzoCD: Illititty
[4:33:44] Rudric_Ice: how tf iilidan turns into a titan ? lmao
[4:33:48] FleuryGG: "Black Temple was merely a setback" i can see it now
[4:34:02] Vile_: @Strifelol If they do this to Iridikron, I'll be very upset; thus far he's been written very well (with, admittedly, what little we've gotten); he's got his own agenda, he's using other factions/powers to his advantage, but I worry -- like you mention -- that he's going to be "working for" some sort of Void influence.
[4:34:08] abracka_: sargeras just in intense therapy
[4:34:17] ronny_84: think there will be some kind grind like a legendary weapon or something at all for 11.0 ??
[4:34:38] Rudric_Ice: story is all over the place
[4:34:50] essadis: would be neat if they started making famous characters that are not part of the core story. like Hercule in Dragonball or something
[4:35:03] Wcvechten: hey man aslong as the content is good, the lore is just extra
[4:35:04] cipusanx: `we thought the same with elune and look what that brought us
[4:35:05] Rudric_Ice: wish they hired red shirt guy
[4:35:12] Sylphy_TV: Sargeras just stabbed my home and left. So rude.
[4:35:15] Sollice: Maybe she is the void
[4:35:20] essadis: like the Nat Pages and the big hunter npc
[4:35:40] Wcvechten: She's just like me fr
[4:35:42] Rudric_Ice: GIGA VOID LADY
[4:35:48] kyrph819: and we gonna kill it.. after 553 tries and two guild disbands
[4:35:53] ItsNobbie: Ze Grand Wazoo ^^
[4:35:54] Sollice: DIdnt the old gods put her in it?
[4:35:55] Vile_: Well, Elune has been relegated to nothing more than a Life deity in the grand cosmology... Wouldn't put it past them.
[4:35:56] killerteapotsftw: what sword
[4:35:59] DunzoCD: old gods right?
[4:35:59] ronny_84: maybe new mage spec, void mage
[4:36:00] Sicknessqt: what sword
[4:36:00] Vile_: What sword? KEK
[4:36:04] Sollice: He means the knife
[4:36:07] DunzoCD: "dagger"
[4:36:08] Lonely_piggy_: I put her in there :)
[4:36:09] Vile_: Oh, the dagger?
[4:36:25] DunzoCD: old gods sealed her in it right?
[4:36:28] Vile_: We don't know.
[4:36:35] OhChano: Like Remornia
[4:36:37] Rudric_Ice: nobody knows LUL
[4:36:37] valianya: Think other old gods imprisoned her
[4:36:40] Birder_L: my goblin lured her in with the promise of profit
[4:36:52] Vile_: From WoWHead: "Xal'atath is an ancient being, dating from back when the Black Empire ruled Azeroth. It is not known how Xal'atath and the dagger became one being. Some rumors say that the being in the dagger is all the remains of a forgotten Old God, consumed by its kin at the early ages of the Black Empire."
[4:37:04] LeDerpski: It is just rumored that it was an old god. we dont know for sure
[4:37:04] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee better question, you know the cloak from Sarc? the one with the whispers...who is on the other side whispering?
[4:37:16] Rudric_Ice: y'sharraj will come back with knife wife
[4:37:21] ItsNobbie: that being has been tucked away in the outhouse in the EPL
[4:37:30] Molvonos: @Towelliee I think it's more worrtyiing that we, the players, used Knifu's power to deal with Sargeras' sword, which, if she's typical as far as Void/Old Gods are concerned, means that we just put a portion of Xal'Atath into Sargeras' sword.
[4:37:33] MattyNiceTV: lmao knife wife
[4:37:35] yib_: it is what it is ratirlChilling
[4:37:44] DunzoCD: dont worry Gallywix can just shoot his cannon at her if it actually works Kappa
[4:37:49] Wcvechten: also don't forget Xal'atath during the Argus encounter was kinda happy she got access to that place
[4:37:49] essadis: you already have 6g? dayum
[4:38:01] KristopherMac: @towelliee do you have a sponsor link for the mouse?
[4:38:05] Panadol324: it all leads to WOW 2 - world of Void :P

[4:38:34] essadis: we talk about your headset yet?
[4:38:47] KristopherMac: Thnx.
[4:38:57] Sollice: Its an HS80 MAX
[4:39:00] Sollice: his headset
[4:39:05] Molvonos: @Vile_ Yep, but of all of those, only three of those weapons had sentience proper.  Shadow Priest, Demo Lock, and Arcane Mage.
[4:39:11] Rudric_Ice: throne of the tides next season  water expansion inc naga inc azshara inc
[4:39:13] DunzoCD: headset? Kappa
[4:39:22] Molvonos: And Xal'atath is the strongest of those three.
[4:39:52] Vile_: @Molvonos PrideShrug
[4:39:58] Molvonos: ?
[4:40:04] Molvonos: I don't understand the purpose of that emoji.
[4:40:33] Vile_: "We'll just have to see," more or less.
[4:40:38] Rudric_Ice: we will probably kill off knife wife in one patch done and dusted EZ
[4:40:38] DunzoCD: @Vile_ I use the skull on my lock and that shit still talks up a storm lol
[4:40:43] herzlustafir: towUp towUp towUp towUp towUp towUp
[4:41:15] Molvonos: @DunzoCD Oh yea, he's a talkative fuck, but in the end, he's just a Eredar Warlock, compared to 'Arcane Sentience in a sheepstick' and an 'Old God, maybe a Void Lord'.
[4:41:41] Vile_: The last time Blizzard thought they were playing 5D chess, they revealed the Jailer was behind "everything." If they're trying to play 5D chess again, then... I have little hope.
[4:42:05] Sollice: Do old gods actually use void powers?
[4:42:11] Molvonos: @Sollice Yea
[4:42:41] Sollice: Ok. I was wondering because if they didn't and Xalatath shows priests how to use their void powers more kind of points to her being something higher than an old god
[4:43:11] Molvonos: Every Old God fight has them using shadow/void energies in some capacity, so I imagine between that and the 'insanity' they like to inflict.
[4:43:22] Molvonos: I'm curious why the Void got coupled with 'Flesh' though.
[4:44:50] Rudric_Ice: dont worry metzen will save us  copium
[4:44:54] Sollice: So I cant make a hammer squad on Manaramamam so someone still has the company

[4:50:53] DunzoCD: more kamehameha beams from Thrall! LUL
[4:50:59] Lintgamer: Its still a pain in the ass to solo it now :D
[4:50:59] abracka_: cool looking fight, but fuck that noise
[4:51:04] Yagr6: im off my coffee bro im sorry
[4:51:20] Wcvechten: If only they could stop with fights like hellfire assault and the likes
[4:51:27] Noshpan: Conceptually, Spine of Deathwing was a great idea. Mechanically was a different story, however.
[4:51:33] NickLeonhearth: Spine was funny AF, ppl flying left and right, was a laugh
[4:51:41] Rudric_Ice: spine was cooler than the stupid argus fight where u have to go to the ships for bombs
[4:51:50] andy_4000: yo
[4:52:06] mavericks312: We need a spine skip already

[4:56:33] abracka_: RE4 remaster is gonna be playable on the iphone 15 pro as well
[4:56:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: apple is claiming the iphone 15 is a gaming console
[4:57:00] Molvonos: And Wayfinder's a MMO.
[4:57:02] Armdel: its only the pro version of it isnt it?
[4:57:09] mavericks312: Ain’t no way ppl are actually gaming on the iPhone 15

[5:01:52] mavericks312: Yea  would be a better place without bellular and his cronies
[5:01:58] NickLeonhearth: @Jozi______ you dont play wow because of twitter ppl ? :D
[5:02:06] Flebboo: Same people being ”critical” who haven’t played since mop yet make there lifestyle about it LUL
[5:02:13] SensationalBanana: You can tell when someone "offering criticism" hasn't been playing for years, honestly.   Ex-partner syndrome. They can't move on, and they cannot accept that people enjoy the game when they don't.
[5:02:15] Flebboo: their*
[5:02:20] Mr_Underpants: @CptTeacake what did he do?
[5:02:35] andy_4000: like if you enjoy a game play it and if you don't then just don't play the game but don't bring others down
[5:02:57] CptTeacake: @Mr_Underpants I haven't even followed this thing- I just think generally he's awful.
[5:03:11] CptTeacake: He's very negative, and I'm not sure he even plays the game.
[5:03:23] SensationalBanana: Bellular sold out to the outrage crowd. Clickbait sells.
[5:03:28] Kakotan2143: wow chat is still talking about Bellular?
[5:03:49] Noshpan: Shiiii-ooot. I should log onto New World one of these days.

[5:04:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: The wars in New World are still pretty serious business
[5:04:33] MetalMilitia74: @Noshpan don't bother lol
[5:04:38] Yagr6: im mostly excited about soloq rbgs
[5:04:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: On Castle of Steel two of the titans keep fighting over territories, Supple and Dropouts
[5:05:06] MetalMilitia74: yes
[5:05:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, those two mega companies drove weaker people away
[5:05:37] Molvonos: High enough you cant transfer onto the server
[5:05:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: People couldn't win any wars against them, so they said fuck this we're going to Maramma LUL
[5:05:51] MetalMilitia74: but COS wont have a que on expansion lol
[5:05:54] Mrdarkslayer: there was a que lastnight on mama
[5:06:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: aint nobody got time for pvp
[5:06:42] Sollice: Just play on Mama I have 55k gold on there lol
[5:07:06] MetalMilitia74: @Mrdarkslayer gonna be a shit show soon lol
[5:07:10] abracka_: war of attrition
[5:07:17] Sollice: great its settled!
[5:07:22] NobodybetterPat: When is the new world update? This week?
[5:07:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: 300K is only 3 of the newer super trophies, and there are 9 possible
[5:07:44] vHettwer: You know where I can get weakauras for classic and wotlk?
[5:07:44] MetalMilitia74: probably be delayed based on ptr
[5:07:45] NobodybetterPat: Ok bet
[5:08:04] DunzoCD: @Mrdarkslayer not looking forward to people spawn camping the new resources on launch, thats my biggest gripe with New World no instanced resources
[5:08:17] Mozzeyy_: @Towelliee are u done with Starfield?
[5:08:19] Sollice: I have off that entire week. Katie is taking Wed-Fri off
[5:08:21] MetalMilitia74: lots of issues
[5:08:29] craftyonyou: they just need to tweak some OP things
[5:08:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: New World has a history of delays, it could happen
[5:09:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: THe flail is very strong, but it works
[5:09:23] craftyonyou: flail will be good but seems like  a PVE weapon mostly
[5:09:29] DunzoCD: the spear is crazy, you can pull people in with it and blast em all with a blunderbuss
[5:09:43] andy_4000: man, i just 10.2 to drop
[5:09:50] andy_4000: want*
[5:09:52] Molvonos: I'm stoked to have a healer weapon that isn't a fucking staff.
[5:09:59] NobodybetterPat: We don’t pvp around here towRee lol
[5:10:00] craftyonyou: but overall no big crazy bugs.... just with all the new gear some stuff is wildly OP
[5:10:01] Sollice: Whats that Molv?
[5:10:11] andy_4000: i know man it just feels dragging lol
[5:10:31] phemii: is it confirmed that it will be post blizzcon?
[5:10:37] andy_4000: yea
[5:10:54] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: It's not like the days in the year change

[5:12:05] notdustinx: @molvonos what u mean?
[5:12:17] DunzoCD: ends on the 16th
[5:12:18] ElmSpace: raid testing goes to mid October and without blizzcon the patch would have been expected at the end of October
[5:12:24] Molvonos: @DustinTheWind95 Flail's a pally weapon, lol.  Tanking/Healing
[5:12:54] andy_4000: yea nah its def early november
[5:13:10] Wcvechten: Legion had Nighthold testing into it's release as only outlier right?
[5:13:15] phemii: Maximum said the patch looked really polished for the first builds in comparsion to the latest ones and he wouldnt be suprised íf it would be b4 blizzcon, thats why i was wondering
[5:13:19] ElmSpace: Probably the week after Blizzcon
[5:13:21] Molvonos: Similar to the Sword, most Flail damage will scale to Strength, however the weapon’s utility and support will be linked to Focus instead of Dexterity. All healing, and various other support functions, scale exclusively with Focus.
[5:13:33] Molvonos: towLets towGo
[5:13:42] gravlaxxx: will we get a expansion reveal at blizzcon if there is a 10.3 patch still to reveal the end of dragonflight?
[5:14:22] Vetere30: Vetere30 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months!

[5:15:06] ElmSpace: @gravlaxxx 10.3 probably will be another "fated" season with a different name.  Most of the story will already be in place for the xpac probably

[5:15:15] DunzoCD: yes
[5:15:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yes, flail is paladin
[5:15:22] abracka_: flail+shield and life staff in the off hand
[5:15:28] MattyNiceTV: oh so if you already have a sub active, it won't show when you re-up for 6 months
[5:15:37] Molvonos: Yea bby, cant wait.
[5:15:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Flail has offensive stuff, support stuff, and tanking stuff
[5:15:44] ElmSpace: @gravlaxxx At least that is what everything seems like will happen.
[5:15:45] Mrdarkslayer: its a self heal tank or a healer so yes
[5:15:45] phemii: maybe we only get a 1,5 year expansion lol
[5:15:52] Molvonos: Lifestaff & Flail/Shield.
[5:16:03] Molvonos: Might try to do a heavy armor healer build with that
[5:16:06] devildriver1919: its gonna be either week of thanksgiving or week after
[5:16:28] devildriver1919: we still have 6 weeks of the timewalking to do
[5:16:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is a healing penalty while using heavy armor, but it still works for the most part
[5:17:30] Sollice: Just saw Pandas twitter video
[5:17:34] Sollice: He is looking great with his weight loss
[5:17:35] ElmSpace: My guess for 10.2 is November 7th.
[5:17:55] anjunadeepa: How about the Tuesday after blizcon is the release
[5:18:00] theszoti: what if they release the patch itself before blizzcon, but the raid is after blizzcon
[5:18:03] JQ47: Yo random question I just got into warcraft rumble. What is your comp?
[5:18:09] Nowaayjose: @Sollice cringe tweet
[5:18:28] Sollice: @Nowaayjose I am glad thats what you took away from my comment
[5:18:37] TheGiant99: Boomer Blast and Bloodhunt together is amaizng
[5:18:57] Ispintowin: wouldnt the world first guilds be a week late if anyone of those guilds go to blizzcon if 10.2 would come out before blizzcon @Towelliee ?
[5:19:11] Rudric_Ice: its Xweet
[5:19:22] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee what two tanks you think are going to be the top two in 10.2?

[5:19:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: go visit sloot and stream it LUL
[5:19:51] JQ47: So it maybe open now
[5:19:59] Molvonos: @Nowaayjose cringe response.
[5:21:10] Nowaayjose: @Molvonos thats  like ur opinion dude i just think theres other ways of communicating rather than blaming 1 person on X
[5:21:10] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[5:21:16] Rudric_Ice: do WF race at blizzcon
[5:21:18] theszoti: wouldnt a 14th release make 10.1.7 really long?
[5:21:19] Ispintowin: i dont either i was just asking LUL
[5:21:25] Rainadin: Think the next expac will be an improvement on DF? I just don't know what else they can bring to the table at this point. Without bringing back borrowed power.
[5:21:40] Molvonos: @Nowaayjose Then say that and give a valid response instead of saying something as stupid as 'cringe'.
[5:21:44] Wcvechten: Invite 2 random social guilds to race
[5:22:19] JQ47: Not to mention west Coast Internet to eu is really bad
[5:22:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: And Classic+! LUL
[5:22:36] Rudric_Ice: they should do that shit like TI dota blizzard sucks at that shit
[5:22:39] daniel85mg: the classic plus maybe ?
[5:22:51] Wcvechten: I bet they'll like, announce things
[5:23:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Classic Cataclysm announcement could definitely happen, but it's hard to say about +
[5:23:21] DunzoCD: the survival game is so intriguing i hope they announce it
[5:23:56] daniel85mg: @DunzoCD Starcraft Ghost maybe LUL
[5:23:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: i bet they include a demo to play at home if you buy the digital ticket, kinda like how they did for wow classic
[5:24:02] nicnacpattywakk: pretty much free advertising for all their upcoming content
[5:24:17] phemii: really excited for the survival game but cant even imagine the setting and theme
[5:24:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: they did 15 levels of wow classic
[5:24:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: during blizzcon
[5:24:36] Flebboo: Classic wow had a demo
[5:24:41] DunzoCD: @DunzoCD its a new IP

[5:24:50] toobaked1987: Did I miss the DM run?
[5:24:57] devildriver1919: survival game is gonna be based off in the maw
[5:25:30] Lulaboo: @Rudric_Ice the RWF is and probably always will be a community driven event. I think alot of orgs would hate to have them involved
[5:26:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they aren't even doing a PvP tournament at Blizzcon
[5:26:29] Myndjestyr: @wEiRdO_dUdE KABLEWEY!
[5:26:37] Rudric_Ice: well it is what it is
[5:26:46] Lulaboo: People participating in the MDI and the AWC barley make money as it is. Blizz refuses to increase prize pools. Remember when there was a digital purchase that was supposed to go to the prize pool? Yeah that money never showed up to the players. Blizz kept it
[5:27:28] Rudric_Ice: blizz is kind of a bitch for stealing that
[5:28:00] JQ47: Awc is great given the viewership size
[5:28:10] reaper2204: Hey just buy this pet and we'll increase the prize pool KEKW
[5:28:13] Niksen_99: Remember your server got the name for a reason.. These Defias Pillager is dangerous :D
[5:28:22] NiXProdigy: do you think people will be excited for cata classic?
[5:28:22] PhillyDilly18: Classic Plus? That's a possibility after all this time?
[5:28:30] kaihole: What is "classic +"?
[5:29:05] Niksen_99: So TBC? LUL
[5:29:08] Wcvechten: what if they had this story about the afterlives,  that'd be pog
[5:29:09] Lulaboo: So imagine we didnt continue to cata in classic and we had a brand new xpac
[5:29:20] justagamingfiend: I would just take the new graphics in the old game

[5:29:41] dannyis1337: Classic + "Finding mankrik's wife"
[5:29:47] ididntdoitfr: Instead of Deathwing, Onyxia comes back Kappa
[5:29:52] reaper2204: @justagamingfiend absolutely not
[5:29:52] Rudric_Ice: pog classic emerald dream expansion ?

[5:31:02] Rudric_Ice: wasn't emerald dream supposed to be a region in BC or something ?
[5:31:11] Rudric_Ice: or was that classic ?
[5:31:14] toobaked1987: hyper-spawns in caves are a top threat
[5:31:54] chrisrev: i just got the purple bow of searing arrows drop from a mob in desolace i shit my fucking pants so fast

[5:32:19] essadis: gz on bow...and...rip pants
[5:32:37] overkillz666: think i should stick with beeing a healer or tank ?
[5:32:41] flyingmachin3: 14 or 16
[5:32:46] chrisrev: @essadis lmfao
[5:32:46] shomeurcrits: Nope

[8:24:13] warriorzen: warriorzen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[8:24:28] mavericks312: @tr4ncetv 100% you know the qb runs are gonna slow down now
[8:24:29] MedicineMan: To be fair. The Oilers left.
[8:24:32] Buckwink: AR has an Oline thats not going to get him killed lol

[8:25:17] DunzoCD: we took Fields with upside, and thats starting to not look so hot LUL
[8:25:21] Buckwink: Cowboys compete every year, they are not badly managed
[8:25:39] mavericks312: Mac jones is garbage and the pats should tank for Caleb or sheduer
[8:25:47] tr4ncetv: He wants to make the plays, he's gonna turn into Cam Newton if he doesn't be careful with that. Defenses want to blow him up
[8:25:59] Buckwink: im sorry but Justin Fields being a bust was so obvious
[8:26:15] Yagr6: LUL

[8:26:33] polaropposite76: @DunzoCD well at least the bears have 2 firsts coming up if they end up having to punt on fields but hopefully he'll get better as the season goes on
[8:26:52] Neowanderer: what  happened to the chiefs is reid not calling offensive plays anymore
