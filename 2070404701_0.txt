[1:19:46] skaboom17: sod is faceroll - cleared every lockout via pugging except for the time the raidlead ninja'd

[1:19:49] vlagori: Pugs are terrible on SoD right now

[1:22:10] Elmo_Omle: saw a post about a pug paying 40g for a healer for raid, and the healer then got a 2 week vacation
[1:22:19] KadyFl4m3: so we gotta trade 5g per days in many days in a row to not trigger ban for mount ofc ofc

[1:34:51] ralphmen97: GDKP's would be fine if people didnt buy gold imo.

[1:35:23] Cameron9551: your not the majority. 90% of players just buy gold
[1:35:26] ralphmen97: You are in the minority because you play the game for a living, people who want to GDKP in their freetime dont have time to compete with goldbuyers buy farming gold.

[3:30:07] brock_games: just him and the yeti from free ski
[3:30:26] DrHopenstein: yeah 25% is maxâ€¦ chest, shoulder, 2 trinkets, ring, and 2x 1 hand weapons
[3:31:07] DrHopenstein: hunter lol
[3:31:21] DrHopenstein: 2x stat sticks
[3:32:04] DrHopenstein: yup.  and mobs for quests go grey by the time you kill x amount
[3:32:13] exponentialgrow: he's going for full bis on the char
[3:32:48] DrHopenstein: itâ€™s my new kink.  7.5hrs in a single sitting.  blast 1-80, Delete the toon, do it again
[3:33:06] XerisGG: the tbc bow ofc
[3:33:22] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[3:33:47] XerisGG: tbc feels so long ago at this point
[3:33:53] we_are_whomp: bc you used it for like 2 months
[3:33:56] we_are_whomp: then it didn't matter
[3:34:04] Kp0la: Rogue got bow
[3:34:12] we_are_whomp: icc lasted a year
[3:34:16] bacconader: I wonder how much money kashey makes with this
[3:34:17] we_are_whomp: sunwell didnt
[3:34:17] exponentialgrow: ICC was half of wrath though
[3:34:28] Midiosa: is the hunter legendary the only one that actually just drops from a boss and you don't have to farm mats/quests for it?
[3:34:30] we_are_whomp: not even 6 months
[3:34:45] saiqo1: i wish swp lasted longer
[3:35:08] Tierceron: kidna sucks the raid i enjoyed the most lasted the shortest :(
[3:35:14] Midiosa: oh I forgot about illidan legendary
[3:35:15] Tierceron: (SWP)
[3:35:26] esfdk: Isn't it a question of it being a hunter legendary? Only one class cared
[3:36:18] Kp0la: Valanyr is like atiesh
[3:36:27] exponentialgrow: Kungen wasn't able to figure out how to do quest lines in TBC
[3:36:32] Midiosa: I'm doing the mage staff legendary for cata in retail rn.  Such a pain in the ass.  I would've given up on it a long time ago if I tried to actually do it during cata
[3:36:44] Tierceron: Blood DK DPS kinda a thing now too with it
[3:36:47] i_oracle: the bow from twins was better then the legendary bow for hunters
[3:36:49] skaboom17: i got offhand and the bow - underwhelming :(
[3:36:59] andros54: did you like tbc??
[3:37:27] Grrumpyx: Grrumpyx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! HeyGuys
[3:37:34] Midew: LEAKED bdk dps #1

[3:38:38] andros54: I miss salad bakers NA those streams were always super entertaining
[3:38:53] XerisGG: would you do TBC again if for some unknown reason they did a progressive Classic > TBC > WoTLK again?
[3:39:25] Midiosa: we needed a big attunement quest for Sunwell
[3:39:28] exponentialgrow: BT was too undertuned
[3:39:44] andros54: hell yeah good times
[3:40:27] Morris_ranchett: laty and his country music was great
[3:40:35] andros54: I miss country laty
[3:40:37] LaRevelations: Lol the amount of wipes bakers NA had was shocking. I don't think laty survived a single trash pack
[3:41:09] XerisGG: Drex going from sweat lord to Hardcore guild GM is still fucking hilarious
[3:41:34] portugueseblood: dont think about the casual T5 alt raids though
[3:42:32] andros54: thatâ€™s the best having fun golden times for sure
[3:43:00] XerisGG: i hated the tbc attunes tbh
[3:43:01] LaRevelations: Having only gruul/mag for 25 man content was painful though
[3:43:03] Midiosa: I'm just a dungeon/quest nerd
[3:43:06] portugueseblood: you were on some alt raids with the warrior where they were super casual and yo uwere always complaining, I think it was with onslaught still ?
[3:43:09] Midew: heckin love finding alcatraz dungeon group for 9th alt attunement BatChest
[3:43:11] hellsingzero: Attunement was fun on 1 toon but not on alt

[3:43:58] br0och: LEAKED literally thriving
[3:44:39] Midiosa: I didn't really play alts so I never had to do the attunements a second time lol
[3:44:44] hellsingzero: Ony Attunement KEKW
[3:44:44] Nightbot: Onyxia takes a deep breath. monkaS
[3:46:25] ekiprkl: did they remove the attunements in classic tbc like they did in the og?
[3:47:40] Beaverbrod: they lowered it
[3:47:53] hellsingzero: They lowered the rep to honor to buy the key
[3:47:53] vishu_tw: @SalvDali dali you got dst the moment you hit 70 on your warr what grind you are talking about xD
[3:48:22] Morris_ranchett: !grateful
[3:48:23] Nightbot: For a guy who mainswapped less than a week ago you arent very grateful lol
[3:48:46] XerisGG: Ouro was actually talking about Inisidious the other day lmao. how he joined, had to trial for 2.5 months and then the guild blew up anyway KEKW
[3:48:51] ekiprkl: yes, the trinket that no one wanted and was never constested
[3:49:29] R_GraM_: inshitious
[3:50:09] Midiosa: I don't even remember Insidious
[3:50:27] IRiblenI: wrath lacked rerolls thats why it was bad
[3:50:35] R_GraM_: didnâ€™t u get dst right before the guild disbanded?
[3:50:38] portugueseblood: DST fresh 70 was nice but imagine also getting swarmguard too right after that
[3:50:56] br0och: !grateful
[3:50:56] Nightbot: For a guy who mainswapped less than a week ago you arent very grateful lol

[3:53:39] poggersshaman: pservering before real release is so dented
[3:54:20] XerisGG: the infamous Dragonmaw that Ouro got in the BETA for tbc OMEGALUL
[3:54:31] neon_wow: super hard then quit on release
[3:54:37] Kiitch: Can see how it happened given that was my thought 3-4 months into kara. still dumb
[3:55:17] hellsingzero: That is silly to burn out on the beta. I wonder how many people will care for cata beta KEKW
[3:56:24] neon_wow: I saw your boy fei trying to make rsham work in STV. The onslaught group was getting farmed.
[3:56:59] Midiosa: hyjal was the worst raid in TBC
[3:57:07] hellsingzero: BT was amazing
[3:57:11] xJmoh: The pre-clearing killed sunwell speedrunning for me
[3:57:16] XerisGG: I global'd Skinnay in STV the other day, gave me a great laugh
