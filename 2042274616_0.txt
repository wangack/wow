[0:37:47] Joeweezy24: the plan was to turn on taunt when u went under
[0:37:47] 12typhoon12: You told hunters to turn taunt on!!!!

[1:02:15] KaZyk: i just don't get how they can't get notifications for people getting gold sent / handed to them idk
[1:02:15] Xuranus83: get rid of 5g bid minimums in gdkp
[1:02:15] Xrantin: @GOLDNxyz lol u fell for the bait get emotional
[1:02:15] inflictawarlock: The gold rate is like 70g/10 USD. You can sit and farm for HOURS for that 70g or just swipe a credit card and save the time. It will never stop
[1:02:18] Daphud: "just make 20g" LUL
[1:02:18] DrMaggz: I'v ran SoD GDKPs for weeks now, and theres barely any gold buying at all
[1:02:18] purrfecto: @Xaryu the issue is that gdkp is fine as it is. why ban it? it's like banning alcohol because someone drinks and drives.
[1:02:19] yorchide: Ban GDKP is like condamn drug users... Just baned the gold seller and condam the dealer

[1:02:51] GOLDNxyz: @xrantin YOU BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ SHEEP BOY STAY MAD
[1:02:52] DibsieRS: stop buying gold = lower prices = more gold to fewer buyers -> more buyers because the price is suddenly lower
[1:02:56] Paddyearl42: I can’t play gdkp unless I buy gold tho
[1:02:57] neuemeloria: What is this campfire toy?
[1:02:57] skwumberton: This inspired me buying gold as we speak
[1:02:58] LoosieJuice: he's just telling the biggest dad gamer community that exists to "grind more" for gold - the player base doesn't have the freedom to spend hours grinding gold normally like this guy, a content creator (not you xaryu, the youtube video guy) so he's simply just not understanding why they do it

[1:03:38] l_Malik: Who is Josh?
[1:03:38] usmcgamingfml0714: @xaryu I think this is a good question so hopefully you read it. What do you think about the idea that buying gold actually allows players to come back mid season, catch up and play with their friends. For people who don't have 10 hours a day to play and max professions to make gold legit. I think its a double edged sword.
