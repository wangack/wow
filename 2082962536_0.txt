[0:07:22] jgbrit: I hope Ash'adar comes back to the trading post, no way am I paying £19 for it
[0:07:44] saga_no: The Adventure Guide quest buttons are a bit wonky as of late
[0:07:56] saga_no: I usually have to click them twice to pick up the quests
[0:07:56] tronicmighty1: ooh bfa noice
[0:08:00] cashthb: henlo
[0:08:33] kynlaeh: i have to pack early cuz if i wait and procrastinate it’ll be a disaster lol
[0:08:36] saga_no: I mean.... mount runs are nostalgic
[0:08:48] saga_no: Ref the bajillion Midnight-runs
[0:08:53] Sabrius_: also doing many freehold runs today but in 2024 ive taken icc, firelands, and dragon soul off my rotation cause i got the mounts so best of luck today hazel and chat
[0:08:59] jeffdmk: how would you feel if they  gave away this mount for free for the pirate patch
[0:09:03] darthduk: I hope your freehold farm goes better than mine. I'm at 530 attempts. jakbFEELS
[0:09:11] GreenArrowed: maybe i should get back to mount runs. it's been so long.
[0:09:14] triseratops1: @tronicmighty1  what addon is this for pets?
[0:09:24] triseratops1: oops sorry forgot to unclick reply
[0:09:42] shootidruidy: Good morning Hazel and chat!
[0:09:48] GreenArrowed: @saga_no you inspired me to get myself on a list to be alerted when any new TTRPGs start at my local game cafe <3
[0:09:48] saga_no: Is the coming patch confirmed to be pirate themed though?
[0:10:00] saga_no: @GreenArrowed Oh nice!
[0:10:13] kynlaeh: that’s worse than your midnight farm of 473 lol (at least i think it was 473!
[0:10:25] Ujai321: !midnight
[0:10:25] Streamlabs: THE DROP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFGpn2Byjr8
[0:10:28] Zuldak: I'm kinda exhausted by the 10.2.6 thing. Like... its cool to get surprises on christmas but i dont like not knowing what day christmas is
[0:10:29] zannuss: Howdy Hazel, how's the week going
[0:10:42] jeffdmk: why is being patient so hard for people?
[0:10:44] apheelia96: what are you trying to farm here?
[0:10:55] thejesus1: Good morning Hazel and chat
[0:10:55] Zuldak: @jeffdmk because we dont know how patient we should be
[0:11:01] Ujai321: Snow? In winter!?
[0:11:13] zannuss: Yeah if it snows here it's weird also
[0:11:18] GreenArrowed: it's muggy and warm in NYC, it's kind of uncomfortable
[0:11:19] zannuss: Granted I'm in south florida
[0:11:25] Ujai321: I don't know what normal weather means anymore
[0:11:26] jeffdmk: snow in winter in canada?
[0:11:28] saga_no: Yes.... in my hometown (a bit further north than where I live now) - we sometimes had snow in mid-may
[0:11:38] Zuldak: well its almost winter in australia
[0:11:38] IndigoCat: I've gotten about 60 cms of snow in the last week between two storms.
[0:11:39] Ujai321: But it is winter still, so yeah
[0:11:43] GreenArrowed: it's my birthday! it used to snow on my birthday when i was little, that's the only reason i remember.
[0:11:48] apheelia96: Is there a mount or something your farming here?
[0:11:59] GreenArrowed: but i'm from wisconsin, and our winters are a bit longer.
[0:11:59] saga_no: Snow in May was *rare* - but it still happened more than once ;P
[0:12:01] zannuss: It's 80s and raining here, so normal florida weather
[0:12:09] apheelia96: ahhh ok
[0:12:33] jeffdmk: are you sure there is a mount it does not seem like it? did you get your information on the internet?
[0:12:49] Ujai321: That would be a fun prank
[0:12:56] zannuss: So my suffering is over, I got my silly orange axe yesterday and I got the fyrakk appearance as well so I never have to go back into the raid ever again
[0:13:02] saga_no: As a general rule of thumb - south of a mountain called Dovre you'll expect no more snow by Easter - but north of that same mountain you generally expect it to snow for a while yet
[0:13:18] GreenArrowed: @zannuss gg!
[0:13:25] Ryok: i'm so upset at myself... i did the big dig earlier today tabbed out for literally 2 seconds while the boss was spawning... tabbed back in to a dead boss D:
[0:13:55] zannuss: I keep forgetting to do those, maybe cause the mog doesn't really interest me
[0:14:08] Ryok: and to make matters worse... while waiting for the next one i realized i forgot about the tuskarr feast and missed that as well dazeSadcat
[0:15:01] wolfcloudchaser80: Heh, we've seen it snow on June 1st here, but we're at elevation -- about 8,000 ft or 2,500m
[0:15:20] Sabrius_: just farming mounts, marrowfang, sharkbait, underrot crawg, some others
[0:15:20] Tattedandfab: Leveling alts to 485
[0:15:20] HagsWorth: Good afternoon Hazel!
[0:15:22] saga_no: I'm tinkering away with a Paladin for PvP - just to see if that'll be "easier" than the priest
[0:15:23] darthduk: Im working on all the expansion's version of the pet battle family familiar. Boy is it a lot.
[0:15:23] anker_jym: Hazel, I learned some Canada facts yesterday. Did you know that when they were making Canada a country, a few of the other names suggested were Albertsland, Albionora, Borealia, Britannia, Cabotia, Colonia, Efisga, Hochelaga, Norland, Superior, Transatlantia, Tuponia, and Victorialand.
[0:15:25] ancester: what alevel are you on hc sf
[0:15:25] sibimi: I'm working on acquiring all tints for this season set  for my main! :)
[0:15:26] GreenArrowed: i finished my vicious mount grind last week, and now i'm on a break, but might do some mount running.
[0:15:29] aerissune: Flying around looking for a grey camel
[0:15:30] everspells: hi, it might just be me, but i think mic audio might sound a little quieter than usual?
[0:15:42] Octopixy1971: I am farming raw gold, and leveling some alts and mount farm etc lol
[0:15:59] HagsWorth: Oooo Borealia... that was a missed oppurtunity
[0:16:02] kynlaeh: i’m still doing vicious mount i got up to 2k solo shuffle and now im scared to play lol
[0:16:03] zannuss: I've started doing the weekly pvp quests for some conquest to get weapon mogs. Kinda run out of things to do
[0:16:32] apheelia96: 17 RUNS?
[0:16:33] jeffdmk: it is going to be < 3 hours?
[0:16:33] anker_jym: So instead of being Canadian, you could've been Hochelagan
[0:16:34] HagsWorth: How do you feel about a Shadow Priest for PvP?
[0:16:40] saga_no: So I'm just cranking through the Emerald Dream campaign for ilvl, then gonna chonk through some unrated PvP stuff for honor to buy PvP gear
[0:16:54] HagsWorth: LOL
[0:16:58] kynlaeh: i main shadow in pvp and im doing just fine
[0:17:03] saga_no: @HagsWorth With my very limited experience: ...you'll be a target.
[0:17:20] HagsWorth: I saw a tiktok of a shadow priest decimating in PvP... and I tried leveling one and got bored lol
[0:17:22] toddbrubaker: i am developing the alt army- a little grindy but i want them all ready for what's next, BIG CAMPFIRE
[0:17:27] Th3myth9779: spriest is pretty strong in pvp tbf
[0:17:33] everspells: that sounds better to me, thanks hazel!
[0:17:45] kynlaeh: i would recommend patience cuz you will get targeted til they realize you’re not an easy pick (unless you are lol)
[0:17:45] Ujai321: Not like you can check
[0:17:48] HagsWorth: Maybe I'll keep grinding it
[0:17:59] tronicmighty1: which one do you recommend for new player to experience?? I’m still deciding if I should do cata or TWW
[0:17:59] Ujai321: The tiktoks, I mean
[0:18:03] saga_no: spriest is strong in pvp ...but not if you're an absolute beginner like me (it's listed as one of the harder classes to play well for absolute beginners)
[0:18:23] HagsWorth: Vile weed (Newman)
[0:18:33] kynlaeh: i recommend the trinket that increases your max health despite it not being bis for dps to help survivability
[0:18:33] Zuldak: to infinity and beyond?
[0:18:39] zannuss: I'm trying to motivate myself to finally do those pet battle dungeons including the celestial tournament
[0:19:08] Zuldak: im not convinced cata is going to be super popular
[0:19:27] saga_no: @tronicmighty1 New to WoW overall? I would level a fresh toon to lvl10-20 to get a feel for Retail (TWW) and then maybe do the same in Classic to get an idea of t he differences
[0:19:52] Zuldak: the pet battle dungeon portals in dalaran are amazingly useful
[0:20:23] 7thSaga: tasnPEACH hAZEL AND cHAT

[0:21:46] Ryok: man i die everytime i have to force my cat to take his medicine D: he got hyperthyroidism so he needs to take 1.25ml of medicine twice a day and it's a BIG struggle since in his almost 19 years he maybe had to take medicine 3 times dazeSadcat
[0:21:47] HagsWorth: Morning Reigns all day everyday
[0:22:02] megthemage: @7thsaga hullo! 👋👋👋
[0:22:04] tronicmighty1: @saga_no nah not really I played since legion and my last guilds on area 52 was so toxic and they didn’t teach me anything about raiding or how to improved so I was really depressed that I have to leave my guilds on area 52 but I love my new guilds on retail and on classic wotlk my pop server was low so I transfer and left to a guild but I feel like they may be toxic to me cause it felts that way before so I’m really picky on guilds

[0:22:46] saga_no: @tronicmighty1 Well - then play both Retail and Classic for a while to see which one you prefer?
[0:22:46] Ryok: yep... yesterday he saw me pull out the bottle and he first hid in his cat tree and after i got him out of there he tried to hide anywhere else xD
[0:22:52] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[0:22:52] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:23:07] Ryok: and sadly he will probably have to take it for the rest of his (hopefully still long) life D:

[0:23:59] Zuldak: ive had enough of trees this expansion
[0:24:16] tronicmighty1: @saga_no I guess I’ll do TWW cause I’m loving my guilds on there so I may do that. and I already played wotlk classic so I pretty much know what to do when it comes to raiding so I think I should be ok now
[0:24:27] MikalasRaynor: So just Leaf the expansion alone and branch out
[0:24:34] Zuldak: the toasty butt weapon
[0:24:38] MikalasRaynor: that will deal with the root of the problem
[0:24:43] anker_jym: Hit a wall last night in HC. Got to lvl 16 in Darkshore and ran out of green quests. Now everything is at or above my lvl. Poor Warrior is quivering in her chainmail boots lol
[0:24:54] zannuss: If you dont use the tokens they turn grey and vendor for the same as if you bought the gold
[0:24:58] Ryok: @aerissune huh sounds a lot better D: maybe i should ask the vet about that when i have to get him there again in 4 weeks to have his checkup, it would definitely help a lot but i imagine it's not as cheap as a syringe (no needle) that i can just squirt in his mouth D:
[0:25:18] Ujai321: So how was your weekend?
[0:25:51] Ujai321: That's a solid 10 day cold you have there
[0:26:21] Octopixy1971: ahwww
[0:26:23] kynlaeh: did your partner ever get sick
[0:26:24] GreenArrowed: oh nooo

[0:26:46] apheelia96: didnt know you had a man lol
[0:26:57] anker_jym: !partner
[0:26:58] saga_no: !we
[0:26:58] Streamlabs: Hazel has a Partner. That is all we know. :) And we respect their privacy, so Mystery Partner will remain Mysterious until Hazel decides otherwise.
[0:27:03] GreenArrowed: yea, i finally got over whatever i had, but it was a solid 2 weeks
[0:27:03] tronicmighty1: @hazelnuttygames I’m still desperately waiting for the warband bank so I can craft my stuff on all my toons I’m planning to do in the war within lol…I’m already leveling my 2 crafting toons warlock: alchemy/jc warrior: bs/engineer and I already have my druud for gathering as well. also may use my hunter for something else for crafting
[0:27:14] anker_jym: Whoops, wrong stream command
[0:27:18] Zuldak: keep that nasty cold isolated on the island
[0:27:31] GhostZombiex: yeah it is, i had bronchitis, then it went to pneumonia, then ear infection and lost all hearing in right ear, then went to sinus infect..wasnt fun lol
[0:27:37] Zuldak: blame the child/dog
[0:27:41] Zuldak: germ pots
[0:27:49] goplacidly56: hazelWave
[0:27:55] apheelia96: @Streamlabs yes she said he was resting Iv been gone for awhile so it was news to me :)
[0:28:00] GhostZombiex: one thing after another lol
[0:28:13] saga_no: Dog's fur can be a veritable cesspool of germs
[0:28:17] wolfcloudchaser80: You left the house. You were not true tot he hermit lifestyle!
[0:28:21] Zuldak: he didnt get sick, he just gets into stuff to get dirty to carry germs to you
[0:28:27] kynlaeh: i don’t think they can but they could carry the bacteria on them and you get it but not a virus i don’t believe but i’m just in school so what do i know
[0:28:31] saga_no: So a sick person pets your dog - your dog snuggles with you - boom - sick
[0:28:37] apheelia96: im a total hermit
[0:28:59] Ujai321: So 4 hands on deck?
[0:29:02] Zuldak: has he blown coat yet?
[0:29:07] honeybun_games: i've almost got my partner convinced to get a dog
[0:29:16] jeffdmk: does he have feelings about smelling like cherries?
[0:29:38] apheelia96: Im still trying to get the Rustfeather mount! hazelYikes
[0:29:44] tronicmighty1: wanna know the curses fact about bfa?? you can skin the pitbull in that dungeon and I can’t sleep after that rip…
[0:30:04] m1lkman10: Have you farmed the stratholme mount?
[0:30:06] megthemage: How is Mr Moose doing?!?
[0:30:18] Zuldak: got to get the vacuum ready for when he sheds his winter coat soon
[0:30:19] jgbrit: Hazel, now my BM is almost 70 I can't help saying, oh no my shnacks 😂
[0:30:28] apheelia96: my girl cleans herself after every potty. shes very neat
[0:30:31] tronicmighty1: how many pet do you have??
[0:30:35] GhostZombiex: how many runs strat hazel? lol took me 137 runs back in the day lol
[0:30:42] Zuldak: you have one of those mushroom drain things too?
[0:30:56] jeffdmk: we do need a worm census
[0:31:14] Zuldak: oh one of the grates
[0:31:14] megthemage: Such a good boi <3 he must be getting big by now??
[0:31:29] Zuldak: heh hot drain talk today... idk why this is a topic
[0:31:30] Ujai321: 100 pounds, any day now
[0:31:31] zannuss: Thanks for reminding me about the dig, I almost forgot again
[0:31:38] anker_jym: Where did you get the butterfly pet?
[0:31:56] Ujai321: Draintenance?
[0:31:58] HagsWorth: I learned that the other day! I don't know if its true but apparently garbage disposals are not common outside the US
[0:32:21] saga_no: @HagsWorth They're not common here in Norway at least
[0:32:21] mokorii: I used to date a plumber that was nice I never had to worry about drains
[0:32:22] Zuldak: so my big plumbing issue lately is a sweaty toilet. The water is cold and we take hot showers and it drips on the floor. it looks like its leaking but its not
[0:32:45] tronicmighty1: they should bring back archaeology in the TWW and give them a spec to like increase the drop rate or drop relic that give more golds
[0:32:59] megthemage: In my first apartment I thought you could put sauces down the drain (ketchup and whatnot) then it got SO STINKY 😆 and it was unfixable lol
[0:33:06] jeffdmk: it is much better when you can ignore problems and pretend there are not consequences. trust me i do this a lot
[0:33:06] saga_no: For the longest time I thought the garbage disposal was just a prop in horror films... - and then I lived in the US and had one at the house - the thing terrified me to no end
[0:33:23] GreenArrowed: yea, food down the drain also = drain flies
[0:33:26] 7thSaga: got me some Cambelles Chicken Noodle Soup kinda better then coffee for a slight hangover LUL
[0:33:48] Zuldak: maybe i need a dog to lick the condensation to keep it from getting on the floor
[0:34:27] tronicmighty1: I just realize you’re not supposed to put egg shell down the drain cause it didn’t disposal all the way and it could clog the sinks
[0:34:39] kynlaeh: i was an RA at my university’s apartments and at move out time i discovered many students don’t know what to do with grease after cooking. one apartment had dumped all of the grease from cooking in the little tiny space between the stove and the fridge and just let it sit there for a year
[0:34:56] Zuldak: eggshells are NOT good in my fried eggs :/
[0:35:07] megthemage: @kynlaeh Wtf 🤣🤣
[0:35:14] GreenArrowed: what????????
[0:35:21] anker_jym: Excuse me???
[0:35:24] 7thSaga: O_o
[0:35:27] m1lkman10: Probably condem that building at that point
[0:35:29] HagsWorth: Yummy haha
[0:35:42] kynlaeh: they wondered why they had insect infestations lmao
[0:35:48] mokorii: thats awful omg
[0:35:54] GreenArrowed: it gets gummy
[0:35:56] kynlaeh: it had many molds and gross bugs all over it
[0:36:13] saga_no: @kynlaeh ...were they biology students by any chance?
[0:36:13] cashthb: acid?
[0:36:33] Zuldak: at that point take some sand paper and sand off the greese
[0:36:50] kynlaeh: it was 2 students: 1 was chemistry and 1 was aerospace engineering, both students were from the uk
[0:36:50] tronicmighty1: @kynlaeh good lord when cooking chorizo you’re suppose to put it in the cups and drain the cups once the grease get cooled down afterward once it safe to drain lol…
[0:37:18] kynlaeh: it scared me that that person is going to design planes i might fly in lol
[0:37:21] McScooterson: @Zuldak or diet coke. same difference
[0:37:36] McScooterson: It's what we used to use on the counters around the butter dispenser at the movie theatre
[0:37:51] Zuldak: how close are you to isles archivist?
[0:37:54] anker_jym: Hazel, do you have a soda of choice?
[0:38:10] tronicmighty1: Diet Coke can clean toilet lol
[0:38:31] Zuldak: for the rocks join a raid and you can excavate them from the WQ in onaran plains without completing it
[0:38:34] cashthb: btw just a picture or something over it - solved
[0:39:05] averageteacup: What about Canada Dry?
[0:39:15] kynlaeh: i miss dr pepper so much
[0:39:27] kynlaeh: cranberry canada dry is a close second
[0:39:43] anker_jym: Yup, I associate Canada Dry with stomach aches
[0:39:46] cashthb: how can people drink canada dry without alcohol... yuck
[0:39:53] jgbrit: Hazel, I killed Smorgas in Maldraxxus for the pets yesterday and I got one first time, super lucky. Which one was the one you had to manifest into being
[0:39:53] GreenArrowed: raspberry seagrams
[0:39:56] averageteacup: i love Canada Dry cream soda
[0:40:04] Ujai321: I once bought a Sixpack of Dr pepper when I was in the US. I drank one every day I was there (I bought the thing, after all), and every day, it would taste and feel more like battery acid
[0:40:32] Zuldak: oh yeah its also comp stomp week
[0:40:38] jgbrit: I got the feasting. Hoping the other isn't the rude one
[0:40:39] Zuldak: aka pvp set farming/grinding
[0:40:47] cashthb: btw aren't you a bit quiet?
[0:40:59] 7thSaga: @averageteacup Root Beer Float and A&W Chili Chese Fries Kreygasm closest A&W to me is Bimidji
[0:40:59] HagsWorth: Dr. Pepper is nasty lol, I'm a pepsi all the way
[0:41:03] saga_no: Yeah no - I can't with Dr Pepper - it's not widely sold here (I've only ever found it as a novelty drink in some select stores) ...tried it when I lived in the US and had a visceral *NOPE* reaction to it
[0:41:24] jgbrit: Ahh okay. I may be in for my next grind after porcupette
[0:41:25] Ujai321: We will let you know
[0:41:43] BoogiePonderosa: Dr Pepper is barbecue water
[0:42:08] kynlaeh: my friend makes bbq glaze for his ribs with dr pepper lol
[0:42:09] saga_no: I mean - to be fair - we have a lot of things here that Americans would have a similar reaction to...
[0:42:13] wolfcloudchaser80: Prunes are an ingredient in Dr. Pepper. I think that may be the thing that sets some people off.
[0:42:25] megthemage: Gnomes look so good on the furendship fox!!
[0:42:30] Zuldak: i think even starbucks has tea selections
[0:42:38] Zuldak: they used to own teavana
[0:43:11] saga_no: Coffee shops that aren't big chains are more likely to have herbal teas
[0:43:14] 7thSaga: i kinda wored that to, theres a coffee shop in my little town and wondered if any types a tea
[0:43:14] ancester: can you please check mouseovering the map if the next dreamsurge buff will be the gold one?
[0:43:36] ancester: thnx
[0:43:40] megthemage: Ex barista here - most places will have teas or juices! Do it up!!
[0:43:43] Zuldak: this dream surge is meh. No gold quests for magpies this rotation
[0:43:45] averageteacup: many coffee shops idea of tea is a tea bag in hot water, that's not enough :D
[0:43:51] kynlaeh: i believe starbucks does free refills of plain teas and basic coffees idk if that applies to herbal if they even have them
[0:43:57] kynlaeh: they do have green tea which i semi like
[0:44:31] tronicmighty1: American don’t know that hamburger is from German and French fries is European and pasta is Italy so the only way to say “American cuisine” is deep fried everything lol
[0:44:32] zannuss: I swear this dig never gives me the epic tome, just blue and green
[0:44:34] Ujai321: Do you have a super clicky keyboard?
[0:44:56] Ujai321: I mean for Starbucks
[0:45:00] Zuldak: i like the mechanical keyboards
[0:45:10] Ujai321: You are fine then
[0:45:11] saga_no: I can pretty much guarantee you that you won't be in the way; probably the opposite in fact - ...people see you working there with a laptop, and they figure 'this is a good place to get some work done - I should go here'
[0:45:12] jgbrit: Off to work, have a lovely stream. Catch you round
[0:45:21] Ujai321: Some people do
[0:45:30] anker_jym: Next challenge: stream from Starbucks
[0:45:37] Zuldak: you should bring a typewriter and be as loud as possible in there... click click click... ding! eeerrrrrp.
[0:45:42] tronicmighty1: btw do you know how to move that addon thing above you??
[0:45:43] Ujai321: Absolute anarchists
[0:45:58] BoogiePonderosa: first time i ever heard of starbucks was visiting a friend in Vancouver in the 90s.. then it was everywhere!
[0:45:59] megthemage: Um.... typewriter?! The convenience!! 😆
[0:46:09] saga_no: The Tama list? you can grab it and move it
[0:46:29] goplacidly56: Good movie
[0:46:32] tronicmighty1: rip…cause I moved the addon and idk how to move it anywhere so the addon is stuck next to my quest log
[0:46:37] Zuldak: in 2016 my work used to actually use a type writer to type out their checks... in 2016!!
[0:46:46] averageteacup: it's my favorite movie :D
[0:46:54] Zuldak: this like 80 year old guy used to come in to fix it when we had issues...
[0:47:11] tronicmighty1: oooh weak aura!! *facepalm* Ty lol I’ll look into that
[0:47:23] Zuldak: you know what has aged well? Animal sports movies like Air Bud
[0:47:30] averageteacup: It made me want to visit New York
[0:47:40] saga_no: Do the US still use checks?
[0:47:53] BoogiePonderosa: whaaa
[0:47:54] Ujai321: To be fair, a lot of the old rom coms were bad back then
[0:47:54] cashthb: lissen they are mechanical, it sawes electricityt?
[0:48:06] Zuldak: companies still use cheecks a LOT
[0:48:09] saga_no: O.o
[0:48:09] anker_jym: Sounds like you need a VPN sponsorship lol
[0:48:22] Zuldak: personal checks are rare. Business checks are very common
[0:48:24] saga_no: Y'all wanna know when checks were deemed obsolete and not used anymore here?
[0:48:33] saga_no: Like across the board.
[0:48:36] GreenArrowed: i still write checks to pay my rent
[0:48:39] BoogiePonderosa: i live rural and there are lots of places that ONLY take cash or check
[0:48:42] Andikkarm: I use to work with the last IBM typewriter salesman in North America.
[0:49:05] Zuldak: one of my duties is clearing checks in my companies accounting system
[0:49:05] saga_no: mid-80s.
[0:49:13] saga_no: WHen I was like 1-2 years old
[0:49:24] huntress_laeliie: My mother still balances her checkbook just to make sure that the online is correct and I never could wrap my head around it
[0:49:34] jeffdmk: I wonder if just writing a post dated check is illegal in canada because it is in the usa
[0:49:41] GreenArrowed: we had an electronic typewriter when i was a kid. that's how i typed all of my papers.
[0:49:41] Ujai321: I have a friend working in the US, and he regularly tells us how incredibly bad banking in the US is
[0:49:48] saga_no: I lived in the US in 96-97 and my parents had to use checks for rent and utilities for the first time in a decade...
[0:50:14] IndigoCat: We just used to write 3-6 cheques at a time and pre-date them so we only had to see our landlord a couple of times a year
[0:50:28] Zuldak: i remember going to like staples for office supplies
[0:50:44] saga_no: I remember finding my mom's old checks when I was like 3 years old and asked her what it was - she said it was an old form of paying for stuff that wasn't used anymore - ...this would have been in 1987
[0:50:46] cashthb: lenovo is usually still really good value
[0:51:11] Zuldak: you can also flag issues for when the bank cashes the wrong amount due to it scanning incorrectly
[0:51:39] wolfcloudchaser80: The US is a big ship that steers slowly. Adopting new technology or protocols across the entire nation takes no small momentum.
[0:51:48] MoonTalon: I Keep an Excel checkbook to keep track of how much money I *actually* have left every week because the bank statement can take a few days to accurate reflect the final totals of purchases.
[0:51:49] saga_no: Here everything is fully digital now; when I was younger (pre high speed internet everywhere) it was common to use the phone to pay things, or auto-withdrawals done by the bank
[0:51:51] Zuldak: ive also caught check fraud when people try and cash phony checks
[0:52:03] SpartanSpear1: if your ever looking for a new husband hazel im available
[0:52:03] kalithian2: hi hazel, any luck the mount?
[0:52:04] GreenArrowed: i could use a new gaming laptop
[0:52:13] saga_no: So yeah.... Mid 1980s was when Norway as a whole just decided that checks were no longer used
[0:52:13] NordicSorcerer: Outside of business use, I don't think I've seen cheques since the nineties. And businesses here stopped using them on 2005 (they were used as backup solution for when online banking went offline)
[0:52:15] anne42: My mom had a computer in her office in the early 80s. She use to let me use it to write my papers
[0:52:19] NordicSorcerer: Hi, btw
[0:52:41] Zuldak: some people put hard work into passing checks as real. Then one guy literally took his own payroll check, wrote over it in sharpie and tried to cash it for 5000 bukcs
[0:52:54] NordicSorcerer: Personal Cheques was legal until 1995 in Norway, company cheques until 2005
[0:53:01] Zuldak: payroll contacted him and he claimed someone stole it...
[0:53:08] Ujai321: Like, button mushrooms, or like shrooms
[0:53:14] anker_jym: What are those wings, those are pretty!
[0:53:21] megthemage: You can still get pet coins from shadowlands table?!? *zooms*
[0:53:29] kalithian2: sigh, that one seems to have a very low drop rate, i try every week for him to but no luck, got huolon finally yesterday though from the timeless isle so i guess that something at least
[0:53:35] NordicSorcerer: I have two questions for @saga_no, btw.
[0:53:42] cashthb: I still do every mission table for rep stuff (the draenor one for archeology fragments)
[0:53:42] saga_no: @NordicSorcerer Yes to both
[0:53:46] ancester: cute wings
[0:53:58] saga_no: (Yes I read minds)
[0:54:06] saga_no: Especially Nordic's mind. LUL
[0:54:17] Ujai321: Rustfeather will put a dent in your instance lock
[0:54:29] GreenArrowed: time for me to go see Dune 2, byeeeee
[0:54:46] daws001: dune 2 is good times
[0:54:47] NordicSorcerer: My mind is written in 72point Traian Caps.
[0:55:13] Zuldak: I really like how the portrayed the harkonnen in Dune. The books can get... icky with them
[0:55:17] kalithian2: before i forget to say it again, thank you hazel, your old vids taught me how to pet battle
[0:55:33] saga_no: brb
[0:55:36] Ujai321: Oh right, you read all the books
[0:55:37] anker_jym: I like to think you call him "Partner" to his face too lol
[0:55:55] BoogiePonderosa: dizzy?
[0:56:09] Zuldak: That's Gary Oldman in a nutshell
[0:56:23] BoogiePonderosa: he was great in Andor
[0:56:27] cashthb: I'm supprised people like it, it might have the worst phasing in a movie... besides blade tunner maybe, but that's ironic so don't count
[0:56:29] Zuldak: he was also Orlando Bloom's father in pirates
[0:56:33] Ujai321: And you know what that means? They are good at lying to you
[0:56:34] Zuldak: bootstrap bill
[0:56:37] GustafTheSurvivor: Hello Hazel and chat hazelWave anneHeart
[0:56:42] wolfcloudchaser80: @Zuldak He was my first thought, too
[0:56:45] s_0lst1ce: he also in Marvel movies
[0:57:01] Zuldak: have you ever seen the 5th element?
[0:57:09] Zuldak: its an old bruce willis movie
[0:57:14] Ujai321: Well, good at pretending to be someone they are not, but that is basically just lying
[0:57:15] plainswalker75: Yeah but it was the Thor series, so nobody watched them :P
[0:57:28] wolfcloudchaser80: Daniel Day Lewis is another actor-chameleon
[0:57:29] HagsWorth: Oooo, the fifth element is amazing!@
[0:57:31] GreenArrowed: that's my favorite gary oldman role'
[0:57:57] jeffdmk: wow we should record this date someone asked hazel if she has seen a popular movie and she said yes
[0:58:02] anker_jym: But did you see the previous 4 elements, or did you just skip straight to the 5th?
[0:58:05] cashthb: what about hot ladies?
[0:58:13] BoogiePonderosa: i didn't know Gary Oldman was in Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are Dead..
[0:58:21] BoogiePonderosa: until last week
[0:58:34] Zuldak: i honestly started learning a lot about movies from James Rolf's cinemassacre monster madness.
[0:58:40] Ujai321: I watched RoboCop yesterday. The goofy dad from That 70s Show is an extremely violent psychopath criminal in that, and the best thing, he is very believable as both
[0:58:43] kalithian2: lol
[0:58:52] cashthb: you didn't remember the name of the hot actresses
[0:59:07] kalithian2: the original robocop or the remake?
[0:59:14] Ujai321: It's great, but it's also VERY violent
[0:59:25] BoogiePonderosa: remake?
[0:59:26] plainswalker75: Unfortunately, there's THREE Robocops
[0:59:27] Ujai321: Original. No chance I watch the remake
[0:59:29] GattsuGaming: there is 3 robocops!
[0:59:36] GattsuGaming: and a remake
[0:59:46] Ujai321: And a children's cartoon!
[0:59:52] GattsuGaming: LOL
[0:59:53] plainswalker75: Lol, I forgot the remake
[1:00:00] Zuldak: yeah there are 3 old robocop movies. the 2nd one was... ok? the 3rd bankrupted the studio
[1:00:09] GattsuGaming: Dead or alive, your coming with me.
[1:00:11] cashthb: there's also a recent video game!
[1:00:14] GattsuGaming: "we, we killed you"
[1:00:17] jeffdmk: children need to learn about law enforcement somehow
[1:00:18] BoogiePonderosa: wow the robocop remake did not register on my radar at all
[1:00:36] kalithian2: yeah theres a robocop remake, dont know the actors real name who plays him but some of the other actors in it, gary oldsman, sam jackson, michael keaton
[1:00:40] dodochan123: do you have all the path of ascension achievements?
[1:00:44] Ujai321: It is extremely weird, but someone said: you know what we should do with this ultra violent social satire? Make a cartoon with a cool robot for kids
[1:00:48] darthduk: Aw I love that movie and soundtrack.
[1:00:54] Zuldak: i put on a lot of history documentaries.
[1:01:00] anker_jym: @ujai321 that reminds me of how Walter from Breaking Bad is also the dad from Malcolm in the Middle
[1:01:04] chops6965: the new Wonka movie is delightful, highly recommend
[1:01:17] Zuldak: i miss the old history channel. Before it became reality tv and aliens
[1:02:04] anker_jym: @ujai321 that seemed to be a main theme of the 80's and 90's. Ultra violent adult movies= kids cartoons and toy lines
[1:02:09] kalithian2: havent gone to see dune 2 yet that just came out, it looks good thoughf rom the trailer
[1:02:18] BoogiePonderosa: I want to see the movie of "The Wonka Experience" Kappa
[1:02:42] Zuldak: was there a specific topic that happened with?
[1:03:12] Ujai321: Was it raw milk
[1:03:14] anker_jym: So how do you feel about Ancient Aliens then lol
[1:03:35] BoogiePonderosa: Hazel is a Fruit of the Loom cornucopia truther :D
[1:03:54] anker_jym: That's what the aliens want you to think
[1:03:55] Zuldak: well i just dont know how 'gold rush', a show about miners looking for gold in the wildness is related to history
[1:04:18] Zuldak: no no MODERN miners
[1:04:35] Ujai321: It's related to history
[1:04:35] Zuldak: its like a reality tv show
[1:04:39] Ujai321: I guess.
[1:04:56] jeffdmk: isnt everything related to history?
[1:04:59] Zuldak: yeah the actual california gold rush was a big deal.
[1:05:03] Ujai321: By that logic, everything is history, so anything goes
[1:05:20] Ujai321: Which is what they seem to be operating on
[1:05:26] saga_no: ...aaaand back
[1:05:29] Zuldak: what a shockingly niche pitch for a show
[1:05:52] jeffdmk: do you still not join raid groups?
[1:06:00] rat_with_a_glock: You excited for Fated season?
[1:06:50] Ujai321: Is anyone?
[1:07:12] Zuldak: im excited for blizzard to reveal the duck mount that we are 100% entitled to
[1:08:00] kalithian2: is there a title or anything for getting max rep with the archives?
[1:08:25] Zuldak: Isles Archivist yes
[1:08:43] Zuldak: it is one of those that goes after your name. It's Hazel, Isles Archivist
[1:08:49] Hulkhokie: there are two pets from those achieves too i think
[1:09:02] HazelNuttyGames: https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=19792/just-one-more-thing#comments
[1:09:03] kalithian2: oh ok, i see, just like a glory run lots of sub ones to unlock the main
[1:09:18] Curufin_: not gonna try and get the goggles transmog from crafting all the engineering goggles?
[1:09:22] Zuldak: you need to do ONE of the world quests 3 times
[1:09:35] Ujai321: Is the pet a beagle
[1:09:44] darthduk: To my surprise I thought you needed to get to three in just one WQ. I was working towards three for every single one until I got it yesterday.
[1:09:56] Neltalie: Neltalie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Happy Wednesday!
[1:09:56] Streamlabs: neltalie just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:09:59] Ujai321: Unfortunate
[1:10:01] darthduk: Sorry I thought you needed to get to three in every one*
[1:10:22] heldtheline: heldtheline subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Just wanted to say thanks for building such a wonderful community. <3
[1:10:22] Streamlabs: heldtheline just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:10:26] Hulkhokie: there's a 2nd achieve in there that gives a pet too i think
[1:10:32] Zuldak: i wish it was Isles Archivist Hazel not Hazel, Isles Archivist
[1:10:40] Zuldak: like we should be able to choose where the title is
[1:10:54] jeffdmk: did you hear dfa is coming out with a different way to rank wow collections that I like much better because I am higher on the list
[1:11:10] Ujai321: Lol
[1:11:36] kalithian2: yeah or how about if we could wear a title that comes before our name and one that comes after our name at the same time
[1:11:55] jeffdmk: It makes appearance count way more that is why i higher rated
[1:11:57] Zuldak: DFA has title dats
[1:11:59] Zuldak: data*
[1:12:00] Hulkhokie: "the insane" name checks out
[1:12:08] Hulkhokie: that achieve is absurd
[1:12:11] daws001: seeker of knowledge is my most cherished title
[1:12:27] Zuldak: the rogue pick pocketing for boxes is dumb
[1:12:31] Ujai321: You did it when it was worse?
[1:13:36] ancester: 2016 was like 3 years ago
[1:13:42] saga_no: That achieve sounds like something I could chip away at with my Lore Toon
[1:13:49] jeffdmk: I wonder how that is going to work with account wide reps
[1:13:54] saga_no: aka the toon I am working on Loremaster with
[1:13:55] Hulkhokie: i have 0 good titles, except maybe Predator
[1:13:57] kalithian2: thats a rough grind for that title, gratz
[1:14:29] saga_no: I am forever the Queen of having One Toon Per Thing in this game LUL
[1:14:30] Hulkhokie: oh i have proven defender, i'm proud of that one
[1:14:31] megthemage: @jeffdmk account wide reps?!?? Well there goes a bunch of time wasted.... lol
[1:14:59] jeffdmk: @megthemage i know i am annoyed by it too
[1:15:26] saga_no: It definitely makes it easier to find stuff to do when I'm not motivated for end-game content - like I'll take my Archaeologist out for a spin, or my Pet Battle/Collector, or my Loremaster...
[1:15:33] Zuldak: woo its a gun
[1:15:46] jeffdmk: I would rather be a little annoyed for a while then really mad for a couple days
[1:15:54] megthemage: thank you Hazel! I shall preserve judgment lol
[1:15:59] antiva: the gun is almost the same size as your gnome
[1:16:00] kalithian2: yeah they said for now its only gonna be the current reps that are shared, probably be a while before they back track and make old ones account based as well
[1:16:08] Hulkhokie: @saga_no my entire gameplay revolves around pet collecting an di'm amazed how much of the game it exposes you to
[1:16:14] Zuldak: the GHETA is still the funniest item in wow to me. The Gun for the Humane and Ethical Treatment of Animals '
[1:16:17] megthemage: Reserve. LOL
[1:16:38] saga_no: @Hulkhokie Nice :D I have a dedicated toon that only runs around collecting pets
[1:16:44] saga_no: And doing the pet battle achievements
[1:17:32] Zuldak: oh 14k fragmetns..you could get another archivist mog!
[1:17:53] KingfisherGames: I got my 3rd Island Expeditions mount last night
[1:17:59] Hulkhokie: yea my problem is the pet battle pvp achievements, A: i'm not very good and B: the wait times are absurd most of the time
[1:18:07] KingfisherGames: 5th box, more than 50 runs of the island so far
[1:18:21] saga_no: I'm also slowly working on collecting everything possible in Wrath Classic ...which is a slow grind - but a nice chill one when I don't feel like playing retail
[1:18:29] kalithian2: the new mount in the bmah area?  its a new bug, a scarab i think
[1:18:32] anker_jym: Since I believe you mentioned you live on an upper floor, what do you prefer in apartments, upper floor or ground floor?
[1:18:47] KingfisherGames: @kalithian2 yeah costs like 1.2mil
[1:18:54] Hulkhokie: i wish they would let us chromie into the pre-cataclysm zones
[1:18:58] Zuldak: melted down 1.2M gold for it
[1:19:02] KingfisherGames: can i see his /mountspecial
[1:19:05] KingfisherGames: i forget what it is
[1:19:22] GodsFaithInHumanity2: have you enjoyed having short hair?
[1:19:31] KingfisherGames: cute
[1:19:33] Zuldak: vroom
[1:19:56] kalithian2: friend of mine sold a wooly white rino for 2 mil then used the gold to buy this new one
[1:20:05] GodsFaithInHumanity2: ya short hair is so convenient
[1:20:12] Hulkhokie: @saga_no are you doing the reps as well?  some of those were a slog
[1:20:20] shootidruidy: get the unbrush, it works . no m ore tangles
[1:20:22] kynlaeh: i completely forgot but i recently cut my hair very short which i hadn’t done in a long time and wow it’s so nice, figured if i was going to jamaica it would be cooler to have shorter hair
[1:20:44] saga_no: @Hulkhokie Sort of - it's not the focus right now - but they'll be easier to go back and finish up the more I get
[1:20:49] KingfisherGames: do they also sell a rope? grappling hook + rope would be a fun mog
[1:21:03] anker_jym: Have you already gotten the mount for 20k?
[1:21:44] baconmanden_: Is it short on purpose?
[1:21:55] anker_jym: Okay, I thought so
[1:22:07] Hulkhokie: i got the "all the things" addon and quickly learned I have none of the things, so I got rid of it
[1:22:08] Zuldak: you gonna throw away another 250k on the mogs from the same BMAH vendor?
[1:22:15] KingfisherGames: Those thunder lizards are so nice as someone who plays alliance and has a hard time coming across kodos
[1:22:24] KingfisherGames: <very tempted by the siege kodo off the eshop>
[1:22:26] kalithian2: doesnt look short to me, or is that a wig?
[1:22:32] saga_no: !wig
[1:22:33] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:22:43] J_Shizz: I wish my bags were as empty as yours lol
[1:22:53] Zuldak: the FOMO got me to splurge :/
[1:23:00] Hulkhokie: will this quest give you the reese pet achieve?
[1:23:04] saga_no: Yes it's a wig - one of several :)
[1:23:16] WE5TY_: hey Hazel do you still do the podcast?
[1:23:16] darthduk: I see it!
[1:23:18] saga_no: So every day for stream we're all excited to see which wig it'll be
[1:23:26] kalithian2: sometimes they're floating look up a little bit
[1:23:32] Zuldak: it was inside
[1:23:46] Zuldak: oh!
[1:23:49] stephthebee: does anyone else eat cold pizza?
[1:23:50] Zuldak: i thought it was on the shelf
[1:23:52] McScooterson: there's one upstairs
[1:24:06] anker_jym: Podcast with you and Kira when? I feel like she has opinions that need to be shared.
[1:24:14] J_Shizz: I have 5 open spots in my bag and MAYBE 1 in the bank lol
[1:24:16] Hulkhokie: hazel inspires me to clear my bags (on my main, the rest are full of junk)
[1:24:26] WE5TY_: was it HC classic podcast?
[1:24:30] Zuldak: oh hey i did see it
[1:24:35] BoogiePonderosa: what is this light beam?
[1:24:37] darthduk: It doesnt help that you're character is 3 feet tall.
[1:24:41] darthduk: Your*
[1:24:55] anker_jym: Fair enough lol
[1:25:00] ancester: I thought  u were the voice behind dungeon fables
[1:25:15] cashthb: how about a podcast of the current political struggles of sri lanka?
[1:25:40] FrostBeered: I love your hair
[1:26:00] KingfisherGames: did you see that there's a way to make a character *even taller* in war within? they gave warriors a hero spec that lets them grow 5% in size
[1:26:21] cashthb: you need souls for some mog tho
[1:26:26] McScooterson: @KingfisherGames that much closer to NPC tall
[1:27:16] McScooterson: and she just... deletes it
[1:27:36] McScooterson: *cries in caster alts*
[1:27:44] BoogiePonderosa: i realized after the fact that I went through an M+ with one of those stormwird teleport cloaks equipped.
[1:28:59] KingfisherGames: 4/8 Igniter Coils till I get my quest mount from mechagon
[1:29:30] BoogiePonderosa: that's the dream... AH = ebay
[1:29:36] KingfisherGames: actually i need to check... but i might be able to turn that into 7/8
[1:29:55] kalithian2: it matches your hair
[1:29:58] KingfisherGames: I think I have enough extra Energy Cells and SPARE Crates to make 3 of them
[1:30:02] zendavid: hello everyone
[1:30:18] ghostie1995: when you started playing, did it take long to find a guild? I’ve been having to leave guilds due to disbanding or just a lot of drama and I can’t find a reliable guild that’s chill
[1:30:21] KingfisherGames: oh Hazel, what color do you keep your laser cat from mechagon?
[1:30:27] Zuldak: break time before next freehold?
[1:30:49] BoogiePonderosa: sometimes i wish they'd add a feature to display small items like rings, necklaces,
[1:30:52] BoogiePonderosa: etc
[1:31:02] megthemage: What difficulty do you need to do Freehold on to get the mount?
[1:31:10] ancester: i dont know how to change the color of the robot cat and im too afraid to ask at this point
[1:31:15] saga_no: Hazel's been running Freehold on Mythic so I assume Mythic
[1:31:16] kalithian2: mythic
[1:33:28] megthemage: @saga_no @kalithian2 thanks friends!!
[1:33:44] cashthb: @ancester there's a thingy on that scrap yard area in mechagon
[1:34:29] kalithian2: mmhmm, any time :)
[1:34:59] zendavid: zendavid subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:34:59] Streamlabs: zendavid just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:35:29] saga_no: Yeah that Classic hearthstone cooldown is brutal when you're used to guild-powered retail ones LUL
[1:35:49] shuffdub: still no mount! ive been rooting for you so hard :(
[1:35:54] kalithian2: the zone is just dailies and stuff but theres also a portal thats the mechagon dungeon
[1:36:17] saga_no: What ilvl should I aim for if I want to run Freehold on Mythic for the mount?
[1:36:35] anker_jym: Warriors can still use guns??
[1:36:49] saga_no: Hmmm... ok - that expands the potential toons I can run through the instance
[1:37:09] anker_jym: That's a weird holdover from Vanilla lol
[1:37:10] cashthb: they really should rework fury into a throw spec
[1:37:33] cashthb: it got removed in like legion
[1:37:45] megthemage: Verr happy that you don't need much ilvl for mythic freehold!
[1:38:02] tommyboyau68: tommyboyau68 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! LOve the hair!
[1:38:02] Streamlabs: tommyboyau68 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:38:22] saga_no: I have a handful of lvl70s at ilvl380-ish or around 350 with minimal work to crank it up
[1:38:37] jeffdmk: dont you have to wait for a mount?
[1:38:42] jeffdmk: save for a mount
[1:38:50] cashthb: looks normal = funny looking
[1:39:04] kalithian2: lol, hazel do you mean when you get a BoE drop in the raid and sell it on the AH for a lot
[1:39:46] jeffdmk: shots fired, hot takes with hazel
[1:40:36] saga_no: I still haven't touched the complete rando toon I rolled from that website... McMistyMonk the Mechagnome Mistweaver Monk LUL
[1:41:08] saga_no: Mostly because ...a) I haven't played Monk and b) ...healer spec. oof.
[1:42:08] saga_no: Weren't those dice a hot item for a while? Like a lot of people wanted them?
[1:42:13] cashthb: oh yeah, how's the bg playtrough going?
[1:42:22] saga_no: recently I mean - while Freehold was a m+ dungeon
[1:43:37] jeffdmk: so are you still forcing quils or exploring a bit more?
[1:44:59] jeffdmk: this is why i have 2 accounts
[1:46:09] saga_no: I'm hoping Paladin will be easier for me to PvP with - button-mash galore - but we'll see
[1:46:20] Zuldak: arena is hard to watch for me
[1:46:55] saga_no: I enjoy watching the AWC - but I sometimes get mentally tired from the commentary
[1:46:57] zannuss: YAY
[1:47:00] saga_no: Eyyy grats :D

[1:47:55] cashthb: next farm is honor pet?
[1:47:56] saga_no: I should run all the instances I still need mounts for....
[1:48:00] megthemage: WOOPWOOP
[1:48:03] mokorii: I literally just got back to the stream as it dropped for you haha good timing
[1:48:08] jeffdmk: broken wine bottle grind
[1:48:10] kalithian2: now the mummy raptor maybe?
[1:48:11] wolfcloudchaser80: Same way with Gul'daniel
[1:48:15] saga_no: for/from*
[1:48:28] Zuldak: Rustfeather says hi
[1:48:48] Ryok: awww man i tab out for 10 seconds and i miss the sharkbait drop doodSad
[1:48:55] Nakotak: do you have the underrot crawg? o:
[1:49:02] Ryok: terrible timing for me today
[1:49:03] Zuldak: yeah he waived 'see ya later'
[1:49:24] Ryok: grats though yagaH
[1:49:27] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh, no, this means you need to clip this and publish it on youtube! You've made work for yourself!
[1:50:10] megthemage: Simple armory is the best I acatually learned about it from you!
[1:50:15] wolfcloudchaser80: Wowhead has a new mount collecting feature. I've only lightly used it so far, though.
[1:50:35] Zuldak: oh you could see if darkshore rares are up
[1:50:42] Zuldak: park an alt out there and just do a lap
[1:50:56] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, seems right for the VOD side.
[1:51:02] ancester: Last week i had a bug happened to me in kings rest... i could go past the bridge b4 the last boss... it kept me porting me to the hallway before the bridge
[1:51:03] Zuldak: oooh
[1:51:13] darthduk: I did Breezebiter when the world boss was up in Azure Span. I spam joined world boss groups to phase myself and was knocking out attempts left and right.
[1:51:15] ancester: whenever i reached the shadow of zul room
[1:51:24] Zuldak: finisih class hall mounts too
[1:52:05] cashthb: cod 4 stream? PogChamp
[1:52:17] cashthb: never cod 4 stream :(
[1:52:31] jeffdmk: @darthduk hazel does not believe in joining groups like that
[1:52:37] Zuldak: well if you got enough mounts... you could play hearthstone BGs
[1:52:37] saga_no: But Hazel ... your mount farms teaches us the routes...
[1:52:43] kalithian2: are you at the max achievement of 500?  thanks for the carry
[1:52:44] wolfcloudchaser80: What if you have enough mounts? My partner just asked if you're feeling ok?
[1:52:46] everspells: wait that nightflame tmog is glorious
[1:52:55] AztraTheSupermage: Enough mounts? How can you say that??? You need to hydrate immediately!
[1:52:57] jeffdmk: I 2nd the hs bg option
[1:53:47] saga_no: Nightflame could benefit from modesty shorts LUL
[1:54:19] jeffdmk: They really need more mount achievements past 500, 500 is really low
[1:54:48] cashthb: spend it on bread!
[1:55:21] darthduk: Are you basically forced to go tailoring on these characters or forever suffer from low bag space?
[1:55:24] ikelikan: Did u get The freehold mount ? 🥰
[1:56:12] cashthb: then just solo the caverns
[1:56:27] ikelikan: Congratz!!! 🥰🥰
[1:56:36] legendarism: HIGH ON COPIUM
[1:56:42] legendarism: no bags for streamer client
[1:57:00] saga_no: Can you rename the snek?
[1:57:10] saga_no: Aw...
[1:57:16] saga_no: Was about to suggest DangerNoodle
[1:57:33] kalithian2: pet battling didnt exist then pets were purely cosmetic
[1:58:03] Solarwuf: pet skills ?
[1:58:07] thatguynamedjans: HAZELLLLLLLLLL How are ya doin? :D
[1:59:29] averageteacup: The Barrens makes me miss the game so much ... but i'll wait for Cata
[1:59:31] cashthb: it's only as dangerous as much damage you take
[1:59:41] thatguynamedjans: Im sure that youve been told about my immense salt level hahaha, so many bad players getting my bis over me! lol
[1:59:46] GustafTheSurvivor: Nice!
[2:00:38] Zuldak: technically i think there is a person you can talk to in order to take off the iron soul buff. Same person you can talk to to take off SSF
[2:00:54] averageteacup: poor centaurs .. standing there doing nothing to anyone
[2:01:10] saga_no: Self Found seems to be an incentive to kill everything everywhere *in case* something useful drops
[2:01:16] Solarwuf: a great addon for your hunter is Pet Abilities it will show you on the tool tip (right botom info window) any skills pets has and it has a skill book type interface to show where to get all skills
[2:01:49] Solarwuf: permission to post a CF link of the addon ?
[2:01:58] saga_no: The bot will eat links
[2:01:59] cashthb: how unrealistic... wish I had an unlimited amount of time irl
[2:02:11] Bankshots7: at 18 it should be a oneshot for you
[2:02:24] saga_no: Or anything the bot interprets as an url, I should say... it'll eat it
[2:02:41] Solarwuf: ***
[2:02:54] cashthb: wouldn't make a difference :/ I have BIG plans
[2:02:58] thatguynamedjans: Yeah any caster area in classic is rough
[2:03:04] thatguynamedjans: THats what did my boy Janstwo in at level 30 D:
[2:03:09] Bankshots7: yeah this one (deeper) is way more dangerous than kodobane imo
[2:03:22] thatguynamedjans: Nooooo, on original hardcore :D
[2:03:51] anker_jym: You never realize how much hearing loss you have in one ear then when your earbud for your good ear dies, and you put the other one in and have to turn the volume up 5 clicks lol
[2:04:00] thatguynamedjans: This does seem really fun, Im just too into SoD to take on solo selfbound right now D:
[2:04:33] cashthb: a solo ragnaros would be really impressive!
[2:04:37] thatguynamedjans: Yeah I think solo self bound is great stream content!
[2:04:41] thatguynamedjans: very cozy
[2:04:46] Zuldak: are mount runs considered heart pounding? Im mostly here to chill as a monitor work emails
[2:05:10] thatguynamedjans: You just need a jans! I can always keep the convo movin along! hahhaa
[2:05:15] Zuldak: idk chat is usually good about bringing up subjects. Like do you have any hot sauces?
[2:05:51] cashthb: I'd help, but when I bring up a topic it usually gets me timed out
[2:05:58] Zuldak: Siracha is still hard to find... and the flavor has changed
[2:06:04] zannuss: Thats my go to hot sauce also
[2:06:06] robinjonis: can you join groups in self found?
[2:06:10] Zuldak: its sweeter now
[2:06:11] thatguynamedjans: Eggs and hot sauce, such a great duo
[2:06:13] saga_no: The remade the Siracha didn't they?
[2:06:38] zannuss: Do you use the regular cholula or one of the other flavors? I like the chili garlic personally
[2:06:41] Zuldak: there are lots of knock off sirachas now. They restarted production of the green cap hoy fung stuff but its differen
[2:06:53] zannuss: I dont like that one
[2:06:56] saga_no: Is the AH and trades and all that physically blocked in SF or is it more of an honor thing that everyone just abides by?
[2:07:08] Zuldak: oh! the wood cap bottles. Those are ok.
[2:07:14] thatguynamedjans: NINE silver? Youre rich!
[2:07:22] wolfcloudchaser80: Huy Fong, the  company that makes most of the sriracha, is deeply a deeply unethical company.
[2:07:26] zannuss: Try the chili garlic if you can
[2:07:33] Zuldak: i had no idea how to pronouce that brand so i called it the wood cap brand
[2:07:42] anker_jym: This is the problem with listening to your stream right before my lunch break lol
[2:07:58] GustafTheSurvivor: i though this was going to be a new realm, that way it would be rid from RMT bots and selling runs, but no... it's just an turn on option on already dead servers
[2:08:03] saga_no: We're a bunch of Foodies in here for sure LUL
[2:08:11] thatguynamedjans: Mcdonalds has a new spicy asian sauce called Wcdonalds sauce and its really good :D its like soy sauce-y sriracha-y sweet-y sauce
[2:08:26] Zuldak: just a little portland rubbed off on you to make you a foodie
[2:08:28] Zuldak: well old portland
[2:08:32] cashthb: sweat potatoes are not a real food
[2:08:47] thatguynamedjans: You invest a lot of time into bread
[2:08:49] thatguynamedjans: thats a food
[2:08:52] Zuldak: you do make your own artisan bread
[2:09:03] cashthb: that's a really cool effect tho
[2:09:07] megthemage: Dear foodies I am going to make eggs with feta and sriracha with some toast just wanted you to know lol
[2:09:08] thatguynamedjans: You NEGLECT your child in the fridge D:
[2:09:19] cashthb: actually why do we have the typhoon we have when that was in the game in classic?!
[2:09:36] wolfcloudchaser80: Oo, and my partner just mentioned that there's a green cholula based recipe for "Sweet honey & jalapeno cornbread muffins."
[2:09:47] wolfcloudchaser80: And now I want some.
[2:09:51] Zuldak: yeah i still get flour everywhere when i try and make anything with it
[2:09:59] Zuldak: tried to make noodles before
[2:10:21] saga_no: I'm not entirely sure I've ever had cornbread
[2:10:21] SnowballsDogDad: Crumbl has a Cornbread Cookie this month and it's amazing.
[2:10:43] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh man, that's a divisive topic. Sugar in cornbread.
[2:11:00] Zuldak: egg noodles are best when home made
[2:11:03] kalithian2: its crumbly and is good with butter and honey
[2:11:49] saga_no: I mean... I've had grits (once - did not care for it...) - but only in the US
[2:11:50] McScooterson: I have one hard and fast cornbread rule: If it's not from scratch, it better be Jiffy
[2:12:07] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no You didn't live in the cornbread-heavy part of the US. It's commonly a southern thing.
[2:12:18] cashthb: I recently decided to get back to food we've been eating for centuries, I just want bread, chese, nuts and some meat. The rest is just zoomer garbage
[2:12:24] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 No - but we did travel a fair bit, hence the grits...
[2:12:25] Zuldak: cornbread, grits and collard greens
[2:12:33] kalithian2: yeah depends on the recipe, some people use more sugar, in that case, no need for honey, just the butter is fine
[2:12:38] NiteMareZx: Jiffy Pop!
[2:12:59] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 We took a roadtrip down to Washington DC - and a part of that trip was along the Chesapeake Bay
[2:13:02] Zuldak: @cashthb  counter point: People lived to be 40 based on that diet
[2:13:34] Zuldak: some day i wanna go to new england and have real new england chowder
[2:13:38] cashthb: no, yuck, maybe some herb when I'm sick, but that's it
[2:13:42] McScooterson: @Zuldak favorite green though?
[2:14:07] wolfcloudchaser80: Does garlic count as a vegetable?
[2:14:10] Zuldak: @McScooterson Green like veggie?
[2:14:25] saga_no: I have yet to try that Kraft bright yellow mac&cheese
[2:14:26] jeffdmk: you dont think there are extreme situations where cannibalism is ethical?
[2:14:32] McScooterson: @Zuldak like wilted. collard, msutard, etc
[2:15:17] saga_no: No hate or shade to those who love it - ...the color of it just isn't appealing - it looks like melted plastic
[2:15:30] thatguynamedjans: My lunch breaks over, gotta head back! Have a great rest of your stream, Hazel! :)
[2:15:42] SassyVulpixTV: Isn't it called Kraft Dinner in CA?
[2:15:52] kalithian2: kraft is kids mac and cheese it very artificial
[2:16:00] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Yeah, cornbread is a thing more in the deeper south. Though these days it's more common. It's actually pretty good in my opinion, most of the time.
[2:16:03] saga_no: I was *offered* it once when living in the US (a neighbor had made it) - I looked in the pot and politely declined.... LUL
[2:16:20] megthemage: Keep on hand for emergencies lol
[2:16:22] Ju1i3: omg childhood Kraft Mac n Cheese and hot dogs
[2:16:24] saga_no: My 11-year-old brain was like "Nope. I am not attempting that."
[2:16:50] saga_no: I'm sure it *tastes* fine ...but like.... it doesn't LOOK like any food I'm used to, so that's the major reason I haven't tried it
[2:16:52] megthemage: Annie's Mac and cheese anyone? So good
[2:17:14] McScooterson: @megthemage with a lil pepper and some peas
[2:17:23] kalithian2: yeah annies is ok
[2:17:41] saga_no: The closest thing we had / have here is something called Pasta Di Parma - which is pasta in a cheesy sauce (but it's white) with a bit of parma ham in it
[2:17:48] McScooterson: also the key to annies is using sour cream instead of milk
[2:17:50] jeffdmk: just make your own mac and cheese it is way better
[2:18:09] anker_jym: If you like sodium, Stouffers is a great option!
[2:18:22] wolfcloudchaser80: We do a home-brewed recipe with multiple types of cheese and bread crumbs for mac 'n cheese.
[2:18:23] Zuldak: @McScooterson heh i like blanched bok choy a lot
[2:18:24] megthemage: Tbh I will pay for the nostalgies lol
[2:18:31] megthemage: @mcscooterson yuuuum
[2:18:42] megthemage: @mcscooterson to the peas and pepper
[2:18:54] jeffdmk: The difference in convenience is much larger in those other examples
[2:19:08] Hippwn: potato chips are tasty but also the price for what it is
[2:19:12] Zuldak: lick the dentist?
[2:19:17] saga_no: My favorite childhood meal was plain macaroni with fried hotdogs (cut into slices for ease) and a dash of ketchup
[2:19:22] AztraTheSupermage: :-P
[2:19:28] sylvija_96: just go :) and stare at them in the eyes
[2:19:29] goosepun: just you
[2:19:32] kalithian2: wow, that sounds kinda personal hazel lol
[2:19:34] everspells: i cant say i have ever struggled with not licking the dentist's hand
[2:19:36] AlecSoD: Hi Hazel! How’s it going?
[2:19:42] cashthb: no way your own potato chips is as good as lays, unless you're recipe has artificial food additives
[2:19:45] Zuldak: like i try to keep the tongue away from the pointy thing
[2:19:46] AlecSoD: Hey chat. I hope everyone is having a great day
[2:19:51] everspells: ok nvm i mean i always do it yes
[2:19:52] megthemage: LOL
[2:19:54] cashthb: sure, same :)
[2:19:55] GustafTheSurvivor: "WILL YOU STOP LICKING THE DAMN THING!!!" (it's a BG3 meme xD)
[2:19:56] rubibeya: Me too hazelWave
[2:19:59] honeybun_games: i struggled with that as a kid, if that helps xD
[2:20:07] jeffdmk: who licks the dentist?
[2:20:11] AmiYuy: I don't find it super hard to not do, but a bit
[2:20:17] Zuldak: i actually had my dentist appt like 2 weeks ago
[2:20:21] GustafTheSurvivor: @jeffdmk Hazel does
[2:20:23] anker_jym: Now I wish you had been discussing licking the dentist during the mount drop for the out of context YouTube short lol
[2:20:24] saga_no: You sold the thing you were gonna feed Lola with I think?
[2:20:38] saga_no: Oh ok
[2:20:42] rubibeya: I ask them to pit the bite block and pick that instead
[2:20:49] rubibeya: Lick*
[2:20:50] kalithian2: she means the tools that the dentist has in her mouth
[2:20:50] AlecSoD: What are you playing?
[2:20:51] wolfcloudchaser80: It's like the tongue is its own little creature, poking around and checking out its environment. It's only polite it says hello to visitors!
[2:20:53] huntress_laeliie: Anyone that claims to have total control over their tongue lies :p
[2:21:07] everspells: the real question is would lola be able to avoid licking the dentist's hand
[2:21:25] Zuldak: i focus more on keeping my tongue out of sight
[2:21:48] saga_no: My anxious response is to chomp if something is in my mouth that shouldn't be there, so ...dentists' fingers are at actual risk....
[2:21:57] AlecSoD: Are you playing Hardcore?
[2:22:07] Zuldak: i always tell myself the dentists work on kids and they are probably worse than me
[2:22:13] GustafTheSurvivor: next saturday video, when she talks about her life this week: "i tried my best not to lick the dentist!"
[2:22:16] Hippwn: the pre dental dental cleaning
[2:22:27] cashthb: but don't you pull your tongue back so stuff doesn't fly down your throat and such?
[2:22:53] rubibeya: My problem is more about biting the dentist than licking.
[2:23:05] Zuldak: yeah licking is better than biting
[2:23:16] saga_no: Yeah I'm more likely to chomp the fingies than lick them
[2:23:21] cashthb: want an "over hearing stuff at the doctor" horror short?
[2:23:45] GustafTheSurvivor: i had a problem in my lower jaw, and this dentist called like 2 other doctors, and then another came by, they were surprised somehow... i remember seeing 4 dentists discussing about my Jaw x.x
[2:23:47] Zuldak: hazel is worried about the tongue licking and saga is going cannibal on the fingers Kappa
[2:24:16] saga_no: @Zuldak Like I said, it's an anxious response to having foreign objects in my mouth..
[2:24:23] saga_no: so... the memes pratically write themselves
[2:24:27] Zuldak: 'hey, come take a look at this!' is rarely a good thing in a medical setting
[2:24:58] GustafTheSurvivor: @Zuldak yup, it made me very anxious
[2:24:58] saga_no: I also have major issues with doctors trying to look down my throat using a tongue depressor
[2:25:11] saga_no: I've been dangerously close to punching doctors in the face from it
[2:25:22] everspells: sometimes while the dentist is doing their thing i get really self conscious about breathing and have to pick my moment to take a breath lol
[2:25:25] Zuldak: i have a unique quirk in my oral anatomy too but i do well to hide it
[2:25:41] saga_no: I will absolutely grab their wrist and remove their hand ...I don't deal well with the feeling of gagging (it triggers panic attacks)
[2:25:44] Zuldak: yeah i try not to swallow too much >.>
[2:26:23] saga_no: brb
[2:26:54] Zuldak: shes been there for like 30 min. stealth
[2:26:57] SassyVulpixTV: Hi babyyyy
[2:27:17] everspells: nurse kira
[2:27:44] Zuldak: its the stripes on her legs
[2:27:52] McScooterson: kira having the ultimate chill
[2:28:07] Zuldak: i think her pattern is called mackerel so she's a fish
[2:28:23] plainswalker75: Our cats are turning 10 in a couple weeks and I can't handle it hazelCry
[2:28:44] Zuldak: had a cat named fluffy and she was a tortoise shell. we called her our fluffy turtle
[2:29:59] Zuldak: if they put the chair too far back and the blood rushes to your head...
[2:32:02] GustafTheSurvivor: nah, you should be scared when vultures surround you
[2:32:19] Solarwuf: take stolen silver also since you are nearby
[2:32:39] Zuldak: im seeing the geese coming back.
[2:33:00] wolfcloudchaser80: Every once in a while, they're just riding a thermal updraft. Means they don't have to flap.
[2:33:17] cashthb: only african snake I know are haspens and mambas, I think they'd follow you if you violate their private space (their private space is the whole continent)
[2:33:19] GustafTheSurvivor: well, vultures mean you're ill and soon to be weak that they can take you, or you're near dead animals, inside something's territory
[2:33:23] ScatteRRealmS: ScatteRRealmS subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! Hey Hazel, hope you're having a good day ^_^¥
[2:33:23] Streamlabs: scatterrealms just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:34:11] McScooterson: can rogues still pickpocket in self found?
[2:34:39] cashthb: btw isn't dual wielding just better in classic 'cause you could use 2 enchantments?
[2:35:30] saga_no: ...aaand back
[2:36:06] cashthb: oh, right
[2:36:29] wolfcloudchaser80: Rogues used to be able to troll people good in the old days. They'd do "/em picks your pocket and steals 72 silver!" And so many people fell for it and got mad.
[2:36:42] GustafTheSurvivor: anneCat cat
[2:37:01] Zuldak: so close to 19
[2:37:51] saga_no: Is this "someone" Flabby? LUL
[2:38:08] GustafTheSurvivor: good thing about leatherworking is you'll be able to make some devilsaur gear for yourself anneFlex
[2:38:13] wolfcloudchaser80: Hm, I know about %t for targetname, but not the one for anyone's name.
[2:38:52] mokorii: you can do /e to make custome emotes
[2:39:00] mokorii: custom
[2:39:06] wolfcloudchaser80: Ah, that's a simpler solution
[2:41:44] mokorii: I remember getting that when I did HC and being so confused why it wasnt pushing me back lol
