[1:53:21] lukec1996: @Merkarion ask and ye shall receive lol
[1:53:26] Xyronic: @zer0f0x for extreme high end pushing, it's the best for sure. Is it mandatory? No.
[1:53:35] fivetob: They also changed comp
[1:53:38] Xyronic: but for a competition with money on the line you want every extra bit of damage you can get

[1:53:51] sooperman64: @Xyronic do you think the WW or the mage is more vital for a M+ group?
[1:53:54] Shearin77: @ask_peter some echo players wanted to do other things so they borrowed some players
[1:53:55] Theliahh: @ask_peter Yes. Tank in Ambition (Golden Guardians) couldn't commit due to irl issues and they couldnt find a replacement, meanwhile echo had 2 dps spots open

[1:54:37] ttiewinwt: specs are only relevant in extremely high end content in general, anywhere else you can make up any class weaknesses by playing better
[1:54:37] Theliahh: @lukurjd meeres' vacation was doing all 36 mage towers LOL
[1:54:40] blurz420: chat method sheesh failed the first hoa 29?
[1:54:41] JustLewlies: @sooperman64 100% the WW for both the debuff and aoe damage. Besides you can always do resto shaman for hero if mage for some reason got swapped out.

[3:48:47] textio545: thaner boss
[3:49:04] JLassie: @xnolosun that's due to raiding being faction tied. more horde players, so you have to be horde to raid in the higher ranked guilds
[3:49:04] xPhlair: @Shearin77 SMOrc
[3:49:05] Theliahh: horde is popular because historically top raid guilds have been horde
[3:49:09] MaTheMongoose: because thats where all the good people/guilds are
[3:49:21] 324bee21: @shearin77 usually racial are better for raid dps
[3:49:23] joysenz: @Shearin77 orc racial
[3:49:24] Theliahh: even after alliance racials were buffed, leaving horde means leaving a majority of the top end playerbase
[3:49:26] kimohunt: @xNoloSun well thats normal, horde have all the player base, so it become natural to just play at horde side specially for well known guild. when pushing RWF, they want to do split run, cant find enough player at alliance side XD.

[3:49:34] muyuu: wth is that count/time difference between method and incarnation lol
[3:49:44] Synckery: @shearin77 back in the day the horde racials we’re better and diner that shift it’s always been horde favoured
[3:50:04] Shearin77: makes sense
[3:50:14] sLr_____: horde is popular cos horde racials were sick back in the day and everybgood player went to horde and everyone followed. so now, even tho ally racials are better there's no point switching cos alliance is bad
[3:50:17] kimohunt: @muyuu cause its not a time competition XD its great push
[3:50:20] ttiewinwt: blizz would have to make alliance racials absolutely busted for top guilds to switch back

[3:50:53] 324bee21: I’ve always been alliance all characters, I’ve strongly considered shifting a few to horde for a bigger M+ selection

[3:51:09] Faraday5001: @ttiewinwt they already are.... top guilds are horde because theres a critical mass of players there, for recruitment, sales etc
[3:51:10] Lorrdzik: @muyuu yea, that is sum of all keys levels not count/time difference
[3:51:11] kimohunt: @ttiewinwt still doubt they will switch, unless it become unbalance over powered. but i doubt that will happen. Most of middle tier player are horde side.

[3:52:35] DexterStJock: Blizz are Horde biased though. When Every man for etc was introduced in Wrath, it got nerfed eventually. If they would have left it in, it may have not led to the current imbalance we have.

[3:54:38] sLr_____: @dexterstjock they did fix the imbalance. the prove to that is that alliance is better now. they just fixed it too late and the factions were to dmged already. past the fixing point
[3:54:48] ttiewinwt: @ttiewinwt at this point we'd be arguing about the meaning of the word "busted" there's some level of power that racials could theoretically have that would be enough for top guilds to switch
[3:55:00] delaynomore99: @blurz420 Yes,
[3:55:19] blurz420: @blurz420 insane
[3:55:32] Voujs: just remove horde/alliance, it makes no sense nowdays
[3:55:38] DexterStJock: @sLr_____ yeah, but way too late. And racials being marginally better isn't a fix. They have to be borderline op to make a difference.
[3:55:56] Lorrdzik: @sLr_____ I think the way to fix it is cross faction player for all instance content. That is only way to maybe make it happen.
[3:55:57] kimohunt: @ttiewinwt yeah when the racials can overcome the power of splitpush during hc splitrun yes, maybe XD
[3:56:02] RerouteToHell: @sLr_____ I think there was no turning back. most WF guilds where Horde already in WOTLK, there was no changing, unless they mad ally racials so broken that everybody swapped to Ally

[5:12:58] ArzaSpeGlacon: @aladare That"s a very good quetion, they will reveal it tomorrow
[5:13:04] DhuumFPS: @DexterStJock +28 start at #80 of the best runs worldwide. in those top 80 keys that are +29 and higher, there are only like 5-8 teams. so like 50 people tops.
[5:13:13] HawkyLR: aah, thanks
[5:13:18] Bwelder87: this format is way better with the 1 elimination a day, Makes all day fun to watch

[5:15:14] DhuumFPS: bottom left WAYTOODANK
[5:15:18] DexterStJock: To be fair, gear wise, I guess there's no point in going higher than +18 or so? Although I assume people don't only do high keys just for the loot.
[5:15:26] nisk___: oh man bonedust
[5:15:27] MonstroMart: I'D rather it be NW. They will get that key up quickly and we could definitely see a 30 it's a fun dungeon to watch

[6:03:22] cerealzy: Lolwat @karenamerio it is doable, every spec has been done
