[1:17:55] Artivicii: Varian is probably the most badass human in all of Warcraft
[1:18:00] jasperboy: @I_DoctorSatan_I been wondering that myself. he's been awol since Darkshore, hasnt he?
[1:18:01] NewWorldReign: Maybe thats why shes against the Jailer for turning him into a clone of Arthas?
[1:18:05] CrunkyBrewster: Jaina
[1:18:07] PokerFaceMoose: jaina
[1:18:08] Divine_Miscreant: Anduin is Jaina and Arthas child

[1:18:34] psycho_scythe: Jaina poggers
[1:18:34] I_DoctorSatan_I: No...Jaina is his aunt, we've seen this explained in BFA during "The Pride of Kul Tiras"
[1:18:36] LSBreed: Jaina and Arthas had a thing no?
[1:18:36] idenkaz_: i wouldnt be even mad just confused af
[1:18:39] SonofHorus82: it makes sense. They did smash.
[1:18:42] CrunkyBrewster: Jaina and Arthas secret Love child
[1:18:51] michal120790: Andiun is a son of Arthas but without genetical conection he simply has taken him as a son since it is a fantasy
[1:18:53] Redbearded16: Could be a Double dad type situation
[1:18:54] I_DoctorSatan_I: Anduin called Jaina "auntie"
[1:18:56] CrazyHighDanglles: you think arthas was just smashing random stray on the side while seeing jaina
[1:19:00] Sollice: Jaina had Anduin. Dreadlord wiped her memory. Jailer planned all of this to get Anduins power. IT ALL MAKES SENSE
[1:19:03] Artivicii: The only warrior more badass than varian is wc3 grommash hellscream
[1:19:04] xXSiebzehnXx: I think this is some sort of Sylvanis knew shit was going down, so she betrayed everyone to get their attention where it needed to be (the jailer). Anduin was her target all along. She needed him to see through the veil and she knew the light would be able to bring him back. I think he’s the key to the dreadlords expansion
[1:19:10] psycho_scythe: Chronicle Vol 4: The Secret Love Child

[1:55:18] metavahn231: just wait tbc will kill retail
[1:55:40] Murlocz: Fresh servers will prolly have a population/faction unbalance problem, like servers that were released late in Classic to spread the queue
[1:55:42] Padarius: I'm ok with that
[1:55:45] Molvonos: @Murlocz siiiiiiiiiiiiigh

[3:56:03] Sacrolush: feral was fun because you had to play really hard to fight the dps meters
[3:56:06] Redbearded16: @sacrolush feral pog. Amen brother
[3:56:27] Molvonos: 4x the work, half the deeps
[3:56:32] thetrumenshow: the bear tank is  a good alt since you can get kara ready with only like 3 dungeon drops and a bunch of quest rewards
[3:56:45] iLtDan: CoD update is bad
[3:56:46] thetrumenshow: the pally needs a lot more time investment for uncrushable
[3:57:49] Wulfgrym: bear is pretty crazy after tier 6 gear
[3:57:51] AsapHarlem: No SM/Mara boosts planned my guy?
[3:57:51] Sacrolush: @Molvonos All the top dps you just litrally spmmed 1 macro.  great for numbers... no fun though
[3:57:59] PawgersHC: are warriors still god tier?
[3:58:13] Sacrolush: and so satisfying when you play tricky class well
[3:58:28] Molvonos: @Sacrolush I aint about that carpeltunnel life tho
[3:58:30] Wulfgrym: warrirs are good but lose to pally and druid as they get outgeared
[3:58:38] Cartharon: but feral is also great right?
[3:58:39] thetrumenshow: warriors are required on a few fights
[3:58:41] Sacrolush: lol Mol  true true
[3:58:51] thetrumenshow: but other than those the bear pally combo is best
[3:58:56] Ginchey: Hey @Towelliee think that there will be fresh BC servers on launch?
[3:59:24] Mamagos: Did they mention how gold xfer is gonna work out? people allowed to bring over all classic stuff?
[3:59:30] Ginchey: Bummer, I wanted a clean slate economy and start from lvl 1 at launch
[3:59:31] Silentcrits: Theey said no fresh classic servers. BUt i dont expect fresh tbc servers
[3:59:31] stuarfthepally: Maybe we can just get an Ony Cam for the day!?
[3:59:42] Mamagos: Thats awful then, rip TBC
[3:59:54] zeviika: i have to wait for classic servers anyways. cant level my space goat until then :(
[3:59:56] Redbearded16: Feral is more of a pvp heathen but gets the job done in pve in tbc
[4:00:00] BLSRougeKing: is there any sort of Hammer Squad guild on any of the retail servers like weve done for tbc?
[4:00:00] Sacrolush: @havas564 yeah lots of snapshotting bleeds, power shifting etc etc  good celing
[4:00:17] Silentcrits: Whats to stop me from piling all of my gold to my main copy him over to classic and tbc then mailing that classic gold to an alt and doing it again?
[4:00:45] jeneraljelly: If they have half a brain the char copy will happen all at once
[4:00:48] calamitygg: It’s a snapshot @silentcrits
[4:00:53] Pushma: he lost me at gold
[4:00:57] thetrumenshow: you cant log into the alt to get the stuff before you choose which server to send them too
[4:00:58] sprert: @Silentcrits they snapshot your characters when pre-patch launches
[4:01:00] Broomba: wtf?
[4:01:01] calamitygg: You don’t get to mail your gold after the snapshot happens to abuse
[4:01:03] SilkeySmooth: blizzard never said you can copy back to tbc servers its a oen time copy
[4:01:11] AsapHarlem: @Towelliee planning to level slow, or got any SM/MARA/ZG boosts planned ?
[4:01:12] Silentcrits: essentially duping your own gold.
[4:01:19] zeviika: i dont like how theyre splitting the servers so much, its like when halo came out with the collection of several different games all seperating their mp
[4:01:20] TheMaxxar: TheMaxxar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[4:01:23] Trawkey: Blizzard implements snapchat to wow

[4:01:53] SilkeySmooth: your stuck on dead classic era servers ort they will be dead inside a few months
[4:01:54] AudioJaq: Talking about making a fortune on the classic side
[4:01:58] jeneraljelly: I mean people that have gold are gonna have gold
[4:02:04] AudioJaq: If that’s meaningful to anyone
[4:02:05] astonishhhh: So the server you’re playing on now will turn into a BC servicer ?
[4:02:07] casa_dilla_: you leveling this druid for PvP or what spec for PvE?
[4:02:16] zeviika: but eventually you will have the other expacs coming out
[4:02:23] Silentcrits: I really wish they would launch 1-2 fresh tbc servers at launch there are a lot of people who would rather the fresh experience > stockpiling gold and mats

[4:02:36] Mckrakan: If they are just going to leave it on the last patch for years, it will die
[4:02:37] zeviika: classic can only be fun for so long doing the absolutely same thing for years. idk how people can do that
[4:02:40] Sacrolush: they just need to make fresh classic realms.
[4:02:48] Sacrolush: and they would be packed
[4:03:02] hutzika: They gotta do what the community wants or they return to private servers
[4:03:03] casa_dilla_: @sacrolush I think they are going to
[4:03:03] calamitygg: Packed for 2 weeks
[4:03:08] calamitygg: Then dead again
[4:03:08] AsapHarlem: @Towelliee you should go SM/Marra boost Kappa

[4:03:31] Sacrolush: everytime there is a patch delay in live...  FRESH SEVERS!!!  l9ol
[4:03:31] Silentcrits: Is it hard to maintain an alt in TBC bc of attunements?
[4:03:36] FirasG93: world buffs just make classic a raid log server
[4:03:45] calamitygg: @abobex the sooner pserver players return to the pserver hole the better
[4:03:58] thetrumenshow: it is hard
[4:04:09] thetrumenshow: usually alts are money makers in tbc
[4:04:15] Mamagos: Played 2 toons back then in 2007, don't remember it being "hard" just abit of commitment
[4:04:21] blade_killa: Im starting to level my horde mage for tbc
[4:04:50] Holysal: i had my main and pally alt for farming

[4:05:52] Sacrolush: 1 agi 1ap and crit
[4:05:54] pinoculus: id keep the blue
[4:06:16] LSBreed: isn't agi 2:1 +dodge +crit?
[4:06:36] stuarfthepally: to skip the crazy prepatch stuff?
[4:06:52] AsapHarlem: you can't boost or fc in classic.
[4:06:56] sprert: there are no faction transfers in tbc
[4:07:00] stuarfthepally: ah
