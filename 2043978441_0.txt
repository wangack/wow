[0:26:27] hulkhockey: It looks good with the open area with the white walls but it might get a little dark in the kitchen
[0:26:28] Maggaeri: dark floors will make the rooms look smaller
[0:26:31] KristianD80: Pretty, but it would be too dark for me. Maybe the lighter oak would be better than...

[0:41:14] Gat0rCh0mp: " Curcuma longa, is a flowering plant in the ginger family "
[0:41:15] bakerylair: kurkuma is turmeric in English and isnt spicy. Its spicy in the way ginger is spicy because they are in the same family

[0:45:16] maddershunt: do you not have a hot tottie while skiing
[0:45:21] bakerylair: Btw advice, if you find that tea to be spicy, remove the tea bags after 5-8 min, this way you reduce a ton the spicy factor from turmeric or ginger :)

[1:35:19] Somanie: Ms. Naguuguu what defensive do hunters have? I know about turtle and exhil
[1:35:27] TheRatPresident: you can bear form in big aoes, its relevant for many bosses
[1:35:35] Kindslayer: A Ui question. are you gonna replace SUF with something else? Or do you know if they will update it again?
[1:35:37] nerefwow: @Somanie they also have a mini rally, with damage reduction
[1:35:38] 123Sepi123: can you sync lunch with me? il be back in 30 min
[1:35:46] denadrios: Whats he highest youve done?
[1:35:55] antonwnw: im surprised to see this many moonkins in the top keys, i guees its alot because of mark of the wild but
[1:36:07] hooleesheet: I mean both are squissy no doubt, but 1 think moonkin has that hunter hastn is he can absorb easier 1 big hit bearform lets him survive 1 hits hunter cant without externals but both are not tanky
[1:36:07] Somanie: @nerefwow phhhh that's cool okay, I didn't know about that
[1:36:26] Kuroz: !io
[1:36:26] StreamElements: https://raider.io/characters/eu/tarren-mill/Nagurawr  warlock : https://raider.io/characters/eu/tarren-mill/Nagony
[1:36:27] TheRatPresident: its disingenious to pretend that bear form is not a crazy defensive that has many niche uses
[1:36:37] davepoon2: went afk for a Lil bit. was it a depleto?
[1:36:45] Kuroz: it was a depleto
[1:36:46] cornboy1833: When should we be using mushrooms and keys and what should we replace for it? Also hi :D
[1:36:54] Nyxii__: @Somanie I, personally, don't think she is arguing that hunters are squishy. They don't have many defensives, a few but not amazing ones. But boomies have it far worse, simple as that
[1:36:57] davepoon2: unlaki

[1:37:27] CaffinatedCoffee: Is it true you have a fat dump truck?
[1:37:34] hooleesheet: @Nyxii__ and that not true at all, even when she says that. Bearform let moonkin survive a lot of 1 shoots a hunter cant
[1:37:40] shidoni: Hi ! What "easy" class would you recommend to start pushing keys for 25-26-27
[1:37:45] kilzogaming: like in a perfect world as a machine you can abuse bear form enough its just impossible to pull off
[1:37:52] Somanie: @nyxii__ makes sense!!
[1:38:03] mursimiz: U have more armor right?
[1:38:05] Golden_Snack: @Naguura Mage is squishier :D
[1:38:23] nerefwow: @Golden_Snack I play mage, mage is insane defensively
[1:38:26] Bliindmonk: i have 1 million hp on my ret pala xD i feel sorry for you druids :P
[1:38:27] Nyxii__: @Nyxii__ It give a similar HP to bm hunters?? Plus you deal ZERO damage while youre in it
[1:38:40] Golden_Snack: @nerefwow what keys are u playing? :D
[1:38:41] TheRatPresident: at a high key level druids can not survive certain mechanics on tyrannical without bear form - hunter does not have a spammable ability like this, and its the main difference
[1:39:01] Nyxii__: @Nyxii__ also whats not true at all? That naguura is saying hunters arent squishy??
[1:39:05] orangesamurai: -6% incoming damage always on druid + you can talent more stamina. Hunter has just a lot hp and many pretty weak defensives
[1:39:12] Jaekani: I have 2m HP as prot Warr. So even the HP boost isn't as great as people are trying to make it.
[1:39:39] nastye: warlocks and hunters
[1:39:40] Bliindmonk: i have 1 million hp on my ret pala xD i feel sorry for you druids :P
[1:39:54] nastye: and warlocks also have tons of vers peepoHappier
[1:39:57] Somanie: We're also not talking about how much more armor having full mail vs full leather
[1:40:00] nerefwow: @Golden_Snack irrelevant to my point, ice cold, mass barrier, barrier, ginvis, alter time
[1:40:01] LadyCattington: it just makes you more of a sponge
[1:40:09] nerefwow: + cauterize
[1:40:20] kwlski01: it makes you just live some mechanics YEP
[1:40:23] TheRatPresident: at a 30+ key on tyra going into bear form can save a pain supression
[1:40:25] TheRatPresident: its insanely good
[1:41:02] BierDoktor: when a hunter gets a tank pet does he then become a tank?
[1:41:05] Nyxii__: Exactly like i said, both classes are squishy. But boomies undoubtly have it worse. By a small margin, maybe, but worse nontheless
[1:41:15] Golden_Snack: @nerefwow It's true that mage has a lot of deffensives but every single spell without using deffensive will delete you on high keys :D
[1:41:21] LadyCattington: @BierDoktor she never said that
[1:41:24] lemontyy: Roses are red, violets are blue, i ate white chocolate, turns out it was glue
[1:41:40] Bliindmonk: someone being toxic??
[1:41:49] nenkaz: basically any spec on high keys one mistake and  bye bye xD
[1:41:50] Somanie: How much armor does a 485 hunter have 🤔
[1:42:01] slakky__: so basically more hp, same armor = %hp damage higher no?
[1:42:04] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:42:23] Somanie: Compared to 16k armor that Naguura bear form has. I feel like it'd be similar

[1:42:46] hooleesheet: @Nyxii__ Yeah with dots boomie has it worse, with perm a1 shoots he can handle it "easier" hunter has beside turtle aspect nothing. And this season is 1 shoot after 1 shoot. Would it a million dots i would agree hunter is tankier.
[1:43:21] StephixOne: Morning Caro

[1:43:29] ranfel_: @Somanie 488 hunter has 7.7k armor :)
[1:43:40] Fallen_o7: @nerefwow ginvis = sometimes u skip with it its not always up / alter = u have to know damage is coming to use it / mass barrier = gp defensive not always usable for urself . its just mirror and ice cold that save u in high keys

[2:07:38] OrdinaryOlly: Playing destro, what a champion
[2:07:53] Artegoor: that's one of the 'snap spots' for him, its like most of the waterfall bits around that area - never been fixed in bfa i think
[2:08:00] NoStress15: @jirihavoc it's the alchemical flavor pocket
[2:08:27] OrdinaryOlly: Have they fixed the new Juggernaut los ledge yet?
[2:08:28] NoStress15: optional reagent on crafted gear that makes food buff last 100% longer and not expire on death
[2:09:22] nerefwow: plink-182
[2:09:23] jirihavoc: @NoStress15 ah can it be purchased ? or how does one get said buff

[2:17:20] StreamElements: My history in World of Warcraft -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6KcPOniQvQ
[2:17:45] Kuroz: she started playing druid in the middle of wrath
[2:18:03] y0rge: have you seen enh shaman ?
[2:18:03] mystralwastaken: Hey Kuroz BIGCAT
[2:18:10] theskot: and some specs have easy and hard fights too
[2:18:12] pi1ng: tyty, just looking at the history video now :)
[2:18:17] Kuroz: BIGGERCAT @mystralwastaken
[2:19:08] xGreatspiritx: the hard part is multi tasking in a dungeon, for some people its hard to mutlitasking
[2:19:17] xdog6god: warrior gang
[2:19:22] ZellieMasters: First season of Dragonflight was pretty bad for boomkin if I remember correctly so a lot of people played other classes like mage or warlock
[2:19:24] ZooNamiii: zug zug
[2:19:27] Gervantesx: yeah but you'll never get invited to any keys
[2:19:34] Shreddermus: So boomy and spriest are free xd
[2:19:45] mystralwastaken: People expecting me to use Dragon's Breath while I'm Comboosting LULW
[2:20:59] sukoWoW: as a plate wearer, i use my defensives offensively most of the time, rather than a clothie will need to use theirs to survive
[2:21:05] ZooNamiii: i press ret bubble on cooldown
[2:21:08] hidingi: Active defensives are easy. Ignore your healer, and use them after you take damage.
[2:21:42] fennrirq: @Naguura but what Role is hardest in M+, tank, heal or dps?
[2:22:04] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:22:09] IAmJoey: imo playing healer has the highest skill cap
[2:22:13] cloud25rs_: what are you drinking
[2:22:28] pi1ng: @fennrirq healer 4sure.

[2:22:34] bawlxd: From this perspective, you also have things to consider such as mobility, melee range, ranged range, etc as well. this game is very layered with "difficulty"
[2:22:34] hidingi: From a personal perspective, I feel like playing melee always feel more difficult than ranged.
[2:22:55] bawlxd: Some melee specs can melee from further than others, so on
[2:23:08] hidingi: Going through a patch on my mage/boomie/priest always felt less punishing than going through it on my DH/rogue
[2:23:16] Somanie: Some ranged classes have 40yd and some have 25yd
[2:23:24] Gabber__: after healing keys with 3 characters this season im really enjoying having a fury warrior alt for low20 keys. turn off brain and just blast aoe.
[2:23:32] ZooNamiii: role + shot caller is hardest .... like Gingi .
[2:23:46] kilzogaming: the melee vs range thing is giga fight dependent as well
[2:23:58] Judaasx: You havent played Rogue then
[2:23:58] hidingi: ZooNamiii That is also not really a thing in 99% of keys done :D
[2:23:59] bawlxd: Rotation is such a small part of the whole picture in M+, especially in high keys
[2:24:02] Matium152: frost dk , destro warlock and retri paladin have the easiest rotations in my opinion.Frost DK obliterate build i think is the most noobfriendly build in wow ever and you don't have to do much else than dmg,and frostdk is not squishy.
[2:24:05] Judaasx: rogue is wild and hard
[2:24:23] Zapzoda: isn’t enchance rotation kind of intricate
[2:24:30] ZellieMasters: @fennrirq both healer and tank are equally difficult. A good tank that is. Some tanks just pull a whole bunch and then start yelling but good tanks usually plan out their pathing and assign interrupts or other abilities for certain mobs in their Dungeon Tool
[2:24:40] mystralwastaken: The less you have to think about rotation tbh, the easier everything else becomes
[2:24:41] nessarinoracle: Can you give an exemple
[2:24:51] kilzogaming: but theres so much util and min max u can do with aug
[2:25:02] TheGeisl: ret pally is easy to pump damage, hard to use all the utility correctly
[2:25:13] hidingi: We could fix that problem very easily for the dear augmentation evokers. We could just go ahead and delete them already please
[2:25:14] Shreddermus: ofc they should
[2:25:18] Shreddermus: It's deffensive buttons
[2:25:20] Frreppy: And most augs can't handle it)
[2:25:25] FoxxGhostboi: aug sympathizer Kappa
[2:25:29] PrecookedEagle: Playing aug "decently" is the easiest by far though.
[2:25:59] MrSensitive999: fury and ret by far easiest specs to play
[2:26:04] pommpomms: rotation is needed, what i've seen most people fk up is thinking 30-60 seconds ahead
[2:26:09] devilmaycry8564: can you show tallents after ^^
[2:26:16] Kuroz: top left
[2:26:19] MrSensitive999: and bm
[2:26:29] hidingi: You can see the talents in the top left corner devilmaycry8564
[2:26:47] bawlxd: What do you think are the weakest dps specs right now
[2:26:51] fennrirq: @ZellieMasters yeah I just was wondering, I tanked back in Razhageth raids and M+ but then switched to a BM hunter and doing 24 ish M+, wonder how it will be as a tank since two years BibleThump
[2:27:04] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura

[2:27:24] StephixOne: Dev slams what are you on about lol
[2:27:28] Pecorette: easy to learn hard to master
[2:27:39] Yanoru: @Judaasx You have no clue about the game at all

[2:27:55] ZooNamiii: what level key is Voice a must for you ?
[2:27:58] imlaen: Kreygasm

[2:28:20] bawlxd: In m+
[2:28:28] MilchbrotTV: quick question. whats the details plugin that shows wo looted what and which keys they have? i mean im not timing my keys so ill never see it but it would be nice to have
[2:28:40] Judaasx: @Yanoru ROFL stats dont lie bud, look it up, DEV evoker is trash, Surv is trash, and Affliction is trash as well
[2:28:41] Junqt: how are you getting that details mythic run completed
[2:28:43] Matium152: my ranking of easiest specs no matter if you min-max or not: MELEE: 1.Frost DK 2.Ret Paladin 3.Fury Warrior RANGED: 1.Destro Warlock 2. BM hunter 3. Frost Mage
[2:28:55] bawlxd: I play frost DK and I am desperate for us to get a rework, having to stay in D&D feels awful
[2:28:58] jirihavoc: ohh its a  cool info mindow
[2:28:59] ramonbakker1991: when is ur workout plan coming ?
[2:29:02] StephixOne: That also depends a lot on key level, at +18 some spec might look dogshit but absolutely slams on a +27
[2:29:10] StephixOne: Boomie, Elemental come to mind
[2:29:14] MilchbrotTV: wow getting BMed by a addon
[2:29:16] MilchbrotTV: seems nice
[2:29:17] nerefwow: @StephixOne Ignite fire mage for example
[2:29:28] bawlxd: I'm purely talking like high end M+ like 27+
[2:29:54] conhakas: hello can you explain when you use the moons?

[2:30:15] StephixOne: there's a command for bloody everything
[2:30:20] conhakas: thx mate
[2:30:23] fennrirq: do you get the M+ rating if you did not time dungeon?
[2:30:55] mystralwastaken: @fennrirq only what you'd get up to a +20
[2:30:56] hidingi: shaman on fire
[2:31:02] MrSensitive999: rip arcane mage :(
[2:31:08] Matium152: Shamans will be played the least by default because they always are
[2:31:26] Mathrath_tv: Dang, i was muted, what was the answer for the details M+ window?
[2:31:27] StephixOne: fliter to DPS to make it easier
[2:31:29] FoxxGhostboi: bring back god comp Kappa
[2:31:29] fennrirq: @mystralwastaken so to get 3K I need to time all 23-24? That sounds sweaty
[2:31:38] rabe1992: hiho
[2:31:45] Kuroz: @nikon24 standard details from +28 and above

[2:32:41] SakhetEU: the shaman specs are hot, best one at 0.7%
[2:33:00] riotscream: if you want to play reroll
[2:33:01] StephixOne: Elemental does very solid dam in 27+ for example, just not a huge reason to bring one
[2:33:10] MrSensitive999: lol didnt even see arcane mage its so low
[2:33:12] StephixOne: So fewer people play it, fewer people bring it
[2:33:13] StephixOne: Easy
[2:33:17] ZellieMasters: If I could make a group comp, I would get enhancement shaman, havoc dh, and mage for dps. enhancement sham has windfury totem which increases haste for the whole group  SD

[4:05:32] TotallyNotRaien: well this is your reminder, give her money
[4:06:10] TotallyNotRaien: why is twitch prime still a thing
[4:06:23] bigtilter: twitch CEO basically said twitch prime subs is going away in an interview
[4:06:24] karacho_0: karacho_0 subscribed with Prime.

[4:06:53] YagoOller1: Great music choise haha
[4:06:53] BenjaminBright: lol the grift is so smooth tho
[4:06:58] kaztier: thats why you cant auto renew sub with prim

[4:07:27] Thomthousand: 100% loss is not true in a broader context. The main reason I haven't cancelled Amazon Prime Video is Twitch prime
[4:07:29] bigtilter: he did an interview talking about how twitch is losing so much money and one of the ways they are gunna fix is to "review" what twitch prime gives, and make it more "rewards" based
[4:07:40] Dannysdruid: yeah, it's a toggle you click on after hitting the sub button
[4:07:41] Tyrygoosha: I do play keys, but as a healer :) pugs are allways fun
[4:07:50] Gladi127: You can Prime Sub from Mobile, I did it yesterday 🙂
[4:08:03] Thomthousand: Would never twitch prime when it's paid
[4:08:19] Thomthousand: I get your point, just wanted to add context
[4:08:23] chutabulla: time for school
[4:08:28] voyage_icarus: huh, I don’t see the option @gladi127 @dannysdruid
[4:08:35] Faramonde: 1 (one) human being?
[4:09:03] TotallyNotRaien: what does twitch gain from the amazon prime deal?
[4:09:10] onegunpete: you know chat has messed up when MS Paint comes out
[4:09:12] Neps: naguuraNotes
[4:09:16] Gladi127: Click "Subscribe" then it will show £4.99 or whatever your currency is. But there's a little toggle button that says "Use Twitch Prime" or "Use Prime Sub"
[4:09:34] hunterkiller1982: @Naguura knaller Erklärung :-)

[4:10:53] faulen: They have to count the -3 Euro as a liability though on their accounting statements even if someone does not use it. So it pulls into Twitch's accounting statements.
[4:11:33] schiavetto: imagine how hard they'd get hit if out of the blue everyone redeems their prime free sub
[4:11:46] garbagethegreat: Keep wasting my monthly prime bc I can never decide on who I wanna use it
[4:11:49] TotallyNotRaien: weird that they made it a sub instead of account bling like different name colors or whatever
[4:12:04] voyage_icarus: voyage_icarus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! here’s to more diarrhea-inducing streamer emulations

[4:12:41] KollegeRetri: @Naguura wie kann man als Druide seine Flugform auf den Dracheninseln benutzen?
[4:12:44] BraindedWOW: It is similar to a gift card, it is basically an allowance sitting on unused credits. They can clear it at the end of each month when not used though so it nets to zero

[4:12:51] Dudu9000: Prime video = prime game?
[4:12:58] schiavetto: ISPs for example sell a lot more bandwidth than they have, just based on the fact there's no way everyone uses all of it at the same time
[4:13:00] faulen: The same way you would have to put an employee's sick leave as a liability even if they don't use them. Because it has a potential to be used.   Or a gift card might be a better example
[4:13:11] Kuroz: @KollegeRetri pathfinder achievement
[4:13:12] voyage_icarus: @gladi127 you think it can be an iOS difference? i had to pull up computer, didn’t see prime option on mobile

[4:16:07] StockerFock: isnt it kind of like an open secret that they are loosing huge amounts of money with the prime sub nowadays but they cant take it away anymore
[4:16:43] niallox: amazon make money any way for owning twitch
[4:16:54] masta_rocky: masta_rocky subscribed with Prime. 
[4:16:55] faulen: Correct. I was adding that they are losing even more money then you were thinking because they do need to count all those that are not using it. (at least in the short term)

[4:17:42] hunterkiller1982: @Naguura pls open your whiteboard :-)
[4:18:46] voyage_icarus: @naguura do you not like the new druid travel forms? noticed you’re using default stag and the crow
[4:19:02] schiavetto: amazon prime is such a complex product it's even a bit silly making statements about it's profitability or lack thereof knowing what we know
[4:19:07] Speshulist: yes
[4:19:10] TotallyNotRaien: the cat raptor
[4:19:19] Hiipopotamo: Hola Naguura :) how is your day?
[4:19:19] Kuroz: new zone stuff you can farm/buy
[4:19:35] zaligirl731: the raptor cats is one
[4:19:38] Elembry_us: That goat is terrible, but for people farming mounts for the collection achievements have it
[4:19:42] sim967: I get my moneys worth of Amazon prime from Christmas gifts alone
[4:19:51] voyage_icarus: isn’t there a owl for flying form?

[4:23:07] fennrirq: sure Kappa
[4:23:27] halfwaythug: they bought a community of millions of people and connected it to their company.
[4:23:28] RickeG: You can't watch any popular streamer without them advertising the prime service. Essentially paying for the advertisement. You Naguura just thanked someone for the "Prime" potentially recruiting new Amazon prime subscribers
[4:23:35] Elembry_us: @voyage_icarus WoW GMs?
[4:24:03] itsClubby: So true KSI gets all this free prime advertiserment
[4:24:18] kagnaw: Customer acquisition cost
[4:24:26] Allonas: Amazon has enough business without Prime subs, doubt it gains them enough. Twitch is a niche community
[4:24:28] Quikbeam: Twich probably operates on the golden handcuff type of principle, its one additional benefit that makes people less likely to leave their ecosystem, the cost of retaining a customer is much lower than onboarding a new one. so its less money spent overall to maintain value
[4:24:32] voyage_icarus: @elembryus yeah Blizz laid off 1900 workers
[4:24:32] RickeG: @itsClubby He is yoinking the publicity :D
[4:24:36] Jothor83: both get some popularity value that might net them more money , but thats not something you can count
[4:24:49] deeldabilder: Marketing strategies are secret, we can only guess
[4:25:05] schiavetto: no such thing as enough, they want it all
[4:25:50] Jothor83: cant count it as you can count money so its a gamble , and since its going so long i guess its working for both :D
[4:26:35] halfwaythug: how much did they pay`? that pretty much tells what amazon calculated beforehand
[4:26:37] Jothor83: ofc they are , its a hole business model that some ppl monitor , just not something us can figure out

[4:28:10] kagnaw: Twitch probably help marketing and testing there AWS too
[4:28:59] faulen: The NFL Thursday night game is a good example.
[4:29:20] fennrirq: @Naguura delusional is to assume how Amazon operates KEKHeim
[4:29:29] Elembry_us: Wasn't there incentive for people to get prime gaming on Twitch a while back?
[4:29:33] schiavetto: yeah owning such a big bandwidth hog lets them have hands on research and development for their cloud services
[4:29:42] quenvin: Ugghhh, do not even get me started on AWS
[4:29:44] colingoodwin: You mean Jeff Besos not doing it out of the goodness of his own heart?!? LOL
[4:29:47] Jothor83: amazon is known to have good investments so i doubt twitch is a lose , i would find it weird
[4:29:56] Allonas: My personal reason for twitch prime was the league drops, which will stop in march :(
[4:30:14] Jothor83: @Allonas rip
[4:30:19] schiavetto: it's incredibly complex, we could be missing half of twitch's value for amazon and have no idea
[4:30:23] deeldabilder: Will there be more keys or gameplay? Or just talks of amazon?
[4:30:46] ruv3l: Hosting costs for roughly 10 of milions of dollars on monthly base?
[4:31:02] Jothor83: you are watching the key to amazon finance , take a sit :D
[4:31:18] astreinoid: i guess it is convenient to have child companies with losses on the balance sheets even though a lot of the costs incurred are with sister companies
[4:31:27] deeldabilder: It's getting so boring
[4:31:50] nerefwow: monkaW

[4:35:06] Jothor83: money helps with taking your mind of basic things like food and stuff , a human person needs more to be happy anyway

[4:36:06] KatsuuWasTaken: Can i ask you... isn't your leg hurting? XD
[4:36:12] Quikbeam: money buys experiences and things that give happiness.
[4:36:17] Purrfektly: money bought me my PC which is happiness idk
[4:36:19] Nori_Snuggles: 'money doesnt make you happy' is a rather good way to make poor people stay poor
[4:36:23] Purrfektly: more money, less lag, better fps LUL
[4:36:29] Ddayjackson: good morning!
[4:36:35] Jothor83: money buys peace of mind and its inportant ofc and that helps with less stress aka more happyness but its not eveyrthing if you ask me
[4:36:39] jaydoghwt: Money can cause stress, but also relieves it
[4:36:40] danzzannn: Arnold Schwarzenegger — 'Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50 million but I was just as happy when I had $48 million.'

[4:37:47] Mort_83: What population was in this study? EU? US? I feel like it pacific islanders were not sampled.
[4:37:50] Elandrya: i guess that could be true. The problem is you cant even buy a house if you are in the top 5% in income in germany.. Only if you have a lot of savings
[4:37:52] alakion: @Naguura  does everyone in South Tyrol speak more German than Italian than , just curious ?

[4:38:33] popCatter: Ladin
[4:38:36] popCatter: not latin
[4:38:40] danskenntv: If you always live luxury, the happiness will degrees over time because you forget to appreciate the little things in life.

[4:39:06] Kuroz: we're slacking
[4:39:12] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[4:39:15] Sormrr: Latin is the sickest language ever, sucks that it's barely used anymore
[4:39:16] nerefwow: that's like french?
[4:39:16] RusTech: KATODISH
[4:39:20] nerefwow: but mixed up
[4:39:22] popCatter: its has similarities to fiulian and romansch iirc

[4:40:37] popCatter: id be surprised if it was super different
[4:40:43] popCatter: KEKW ofc not
[4:40:53] Qabhal: dont romans was talking Latin ?

[4:42:37] Jothor83: @popCatter hand signals is the future
[4:42:46] popCatter: theres a long running debat about that
[4:42:50] Andersonmps: Fs. Changes the way you think
[4:42:51] AlpineIron: english sucks
[4:42:53] Aalbedon: I definitely think it changes how you think about stuff
[4:42:56] Nori_Snuggles: i mean not many languages have a word for schadenfreude. it shapes you as a german NODDERS
[4:42:58] popCatter: and there are loads of both studys on both sides
[4:43:00] AlpineIron: so bland just like our cooking
[4:43:03] menacingtrees: I'm back again to say YAAASSS queen I lose sleep over this thought every night @naguura
[4:43:10] maneatingpotato1: Like "schadenfreude"
[4:43:22] popCatter: linguistic determinism
[4:43:22] harser: Is is proven that someone who talks 3 languages for example, has 3 completely personalities depending on what language is speaking at the moment
[4:43:36] harser: for example, I love my wife in spanish, I hate her personality in english
[4:44:07] Lennerrt: what personality is more toxic?
[4:44:11] Jothor83: Jothor83 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:44:18] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[4:44:18] popCatter: its called 'linguistic determinism' the first study i can remember is 1936 iirc but i dont remember anything about it
[4:44:19] MrSensitive999: its called code switching friends :)
[4:44:28] Zlxor: we're less precise in a second language in what we mean i gues
[4:44:45] voyage_icarus: @naguura don’t worry it’s just a universal thing brothers say to sisters
[4:44:48] Cyppz: not having a one-dimensional character is considered having multiple personalities these days
[4:44:59] popCatter: there have been many different studies over the years
[4:45:09] NoodleGuy98: You can have the same personally on and off stream, but maybe jsut have it tuned to 150% on stream. that's compltetely normal
[4:45:10] popCatter: about if language changes how you see the world
[4:45:11] Jothor83: based on our talk i sent my money straight to you and twitch , i left amazon out of this Kappa
[4:45:14] popCatter: on a basic level
[4:45:29] 2000ish: I have no personality in any language naguuraBear
[4:45:29] popCatter: its one of the most debated topics in linguistics
[4:45:38] 2000ish: hiya nagura and kuroz PrideFlower PrideFlower
[4:45:44] tea2468: hello!
[4:45:44] popCatter: @2000ish quantLove
[4:45:48] Kuroz: CatDriving @2000ish
[4:45:58] 2000ish: hiya popcatter!! PridePenguin PridePenguin
[4:46:03] Quikbeam: There was a study that showed it shapes how to think and describe things, for example if in your language assigns a female pronoun to a bridge, people are more likely to describe the bridge aslovely, shiny, beautiful. If it has a male pronoun they are more likely to perceive it as strong, heavy, sturdy.
[4:46:05] Nori_Snuggles: @2000ish naguuraLove
[4:46:18] 2000ish: @nori_snuggles noriiiiiiii PrideFlower PrideFlower PrideFlower
[4:46:18] popCatter: yeah thats one of the main arguments
[4:46:47] popCatter: @Quikbeam bouba and kiki
[4:46:53] Nekz3: i do :)
[4:46:54] kaverrr: You do?
[4:46:58] JohnAllenCasts: oh I see
[4:47:00] Fail_Deeps: i know that they say that when you have to speak a language not native to you, that you make better decisions
[4:47:02] popCatter: @Quikbeam a very famous one
[4:47:04] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:47:06] JohnAllenCasts: I thought you were just going around telling strangers you love them
[4:47:06] Andersonmps: And how is "i love you" inm german?
[4:47:10] harser: Most of my germani speaking friends, have very strong points in a conversation, they sound very secure and can keep a great conversation, but when they talk in english, they sound half sure and are easily persuaded to other outcome
[4:47:15] KatsuuWasTaken: @Andersonmps "ich liebe dich"
[4:47:16] Jothor83: oh i know that feeling , i love you feels way to easy to get out and it shoudlnt based on what it means , i think
[4:47:29] voyage_icarus: @quikbeam i do think that’s reverse logic. in Urdu for example, we use male or female pronouns for objects based on how we perceive them, not the other way around
[4:47:33] renzorh98: Naguura could u say me "i love u"? uwu
[4:47:34] kaverrr: I don’t think I’ve ever told a random person I love them
[4:47:39] gambleragain: for a random person in my language, its more "like" rather than "love"
[4:47:42] ArumosLive: its an english language thing
[4:47:47] sim967: Cultural thing
[4:47:49] JohnAllenCasts: love is also an opinion in english though, like you love coffee or something. I guess in other languages it's more of an emotion right?
[4:47:51] popCatter: @voyage_icarus exactly the main argument against it
[4:47:53] Mutepanda: It's because we only really have one word for it
[4:48:10] voyage_icarus: @popcatter lol good to know
[4:48:19] Andersonmps: How many languages do you speak?
[4:48:21] Breaths16: how long u are in que normaly??
[4:48:23] gambleragain: love in my culture you have to really mean it
[4:48:32] theblackfish93: i've heard a few people starting to say "i appreciate you" in place of "i love you" but it feels so wrong
[4:48:34] ShelviJ: i think english towards to exaggeration most of the time in daily presentation
[4:48:40] laccyleyton: Hi Caro. What's the addon enhancing your group finder window?
[4:48:49] Kuroz: !groups
[4:48:49] StreamElements: Group finder wa : https://wago.io/klC4qqHaF the weakaura isn't getting updated. https://wago.io/JhmeKOgMw (dragonflight version) or use premade group filter it does the same thing.
[4:48:49] gambleragain: Nagura loves her fans for example.
[4:48:50] MrSensitive999: ive def said i love this person to strangers before
[4:48:50] Andersonmps: A friend
[4:48:51] popCatter: linguists are arguing between naming things on how we see them, or seeing things based on how we call them
[4:49:02] laccyleyton: thanks!
[4:49:04] gambleragain: @Naguura You love your twitch viewers. But not like love love.
[4:49:04] MrSensitive999: or like casual acquaintances
[4:49:10] popCatter: Whorf iirc is the most major study
[4:49:11] toxaaris: Good morning HeyGuys
[4:49:18] JohnAllenCasts: The difference is that "love" in that context is an opinion which is separate from the emotion of love between people
[4:49:23] KatsuuWasTaken: we say: "boar geil danke"
[4:49:27] NoodleGuy98: I think it's also more an american thing, rather than english, so more cultural
[4:49:29] beerking2323: figure of speech
[4:49:31] illyrialol: You do the same in Italian lol, still say "oddio ti amo" but anyway I agree with what you're saying, not this example tho
[4:49:32] RusTech: neved heard like that
[4:49:39] kaverrr: That explains it. I’m an elitist
[4:49:41] RusTech: souds weird
[4:49:55] quenvin: Sacred?
[4:49:55] MrSensitive999: english is hard
[4:49:57] 2000ish: @popcatter it’s amazing how much you know about it haha naguuraHype naguuraHype
[4:49:58] OdyssaQ: I've said it to work friends who have gone above and beyond to help me with a project or something
[4:50:05] OdyssaQ: Like; OMG I love you, thank you so much
[4:50:10] JohnAllenCasts: english is more versatile, checkmate brexit
[4:50:11] Andersonmps: It doesnt mean that you are in love with theperson
[4:50:15] Breaths16: aber das kann doch in deutsch genau so sein
[4:50:25] Rebemma: I love you Naguura <3
[4:50:29] voyage_icarus: @popcatter i can see both ig. if a novel word is being introduced in a language, that word would be chosen based off of perception. whereas a word that’s been in literature forever can train children to see it according to that bias
[4:50:32] 2000ish: @popcatter I’m just reading your comments like I’m back in school, that’s so cool you know so much about our it naguuraHypers
[4:50:43] Breaths16: ich liebe pizza z.b. lol
[4:50:48] Cyberkaia_: In spanish its weird to TBH
[4:50:50] kaverrr: Isn’t that the Zelda world?
[4:50:57] gambleragain: I said I love you to my girlfriend for the first time in my language she was left speechless. I throw random love you in english and she's like w/e.
[4:51:06] NoodleGuy98: I LOVE pizza
[4:51:16] Mikko_p1: omg I love you
[4:51:23] Andersonmps: @NoodleGuy98 And you area noodle guy
[4:51:32] NoodleGuy98: No it was a perfect example, I 100% agree xD
[4:51:38] gambleragain: @Naguura Here it is. You love your twitch viewers, but not like that.
[4:51:39] popCatter: Its super weird, im super passionate about linguistics, but im doing a maths degree
[4:51:40] chutabulla: dont get one guyd
[4:51:42] OdyssaQ: Even amongst English speaking countries, there are different ways to be polite etc. LIke in the US when you say thank you, a lot of people rely with: yep, or ahuh. It's normal for them, but in Australia that would be considered rude.
[4:51:44] Andersonmps: LUL
[4:51:46] 123Sepi123: I also casually add if they want to marry me
[4:51:48] Cyberkaia_: @NoodleGuy98 100%
[4:51:52] JohnAllenCasts: all languages are the same, it's all just accents, you can't change my mind
[4:51:53] NoodleGuy98: Saying "i love you" is also way more uncommon in danish :P
[4:51:53] kaverrr: I’m not saying your example is bad.. but you’re wrong
[4:51:54] Andersonmps: No love allowed!

[4:52:21] Nori_Snuggles: @popCatter maths is language in itself naguuraSip
[4:52:26] nikolayyanev2: how about when brits always add "love" at end of sentence is so annoying

[4:53:09] CaffinatedCoffee: Explain that dump truck in english
[4:53:13] Aegatron: i go for walk, later Caro. gl
[4:53:18] gambleragain: she's trying to say i love you to us
[4:53:18] Andersonmps: English dont have a word for the feeling of missing someone or something, for exemple
[4:53:24] Aegatron: Thanks alot
[4:53:37] tea2468: is it easier for you to talk about wow in English or German lol 🤔
[4:53:37] kaverrr: The next time I meet a new person I will just say “I love you in English but not in German” then
[4:53:50] Nori_Snuggles: @2000ish definitely reminded me to learn the language of my parents so i can talk to them properly naguuraNotes
[4:53:59] NoodleGuy98: TLDR: whenver english ppl say "I love you", they don't mean it. Got it LUL
[4:54:21] javal1121: how does balanced feel this patch?
[4:54:22] gambleragain: ich liebe dich sounds like a struggle to say anyway. So you must really mean it if you say it.
[4:54:34] popCatter: my french teacher used to dream in different languages depending on where she was living
[4:54:37] 2000ish: @nori_snuggles for sure naguuraHype

[4:57:58] Quikbeam: Something similar used to happen to me when i was very tired and had been drinking. I would alternate between English and Spanish to my friends and not notice until they pointed out i was speaking Spanish.
[4:58:05] Sn3kj: doctor felt cheated bec he did surgery on a moonkin
[4:58:11] fizzleblast127: He didn't ask because he thought "oh god, a boomkin player"
[4:58:24] Aalbedon: Wouldn't moonkin have to got to a vet?
[4:58:24] sim967: I wager naguura speaks more English than any other Italian citizen

[5:02:50] pearl85: @StockerFock  ;)))
[5:02:56] manu1337: if they dont use filler words they know what they talk about. and that is scary
[5:03:07] quenvin: Very articulate?
[5:03:12] quenvin: Sounds kind of snobby?
[5:03:15] Hexereye99: elon musk never uses uhms

[5:03:22] Andersonmps: Oh i love this song
[5:03:31] JohnAllenCasts: I'm really a big idito
[5:03:35] gambleragain: i think the uhm and oms are snobby
[5:03:38] Necron_Hs: is sounds like the person is a robot
[5:03:39] gambleragain: i appreciate clean talk
[5:04:12] quenvin: Like it is common in Japanese culture for there to be long pauses in a discussion as it is a sing that the other party is giving serious thought to the topic.  Most Americans are uncomfortable with that.
[5:04:13] gambleragain: snoby like she earned it
[5:04:15] Andersonmps: Jounalists on the news usually dont use it
[5:04:22] quenvin: sing = sign*

[5:04:40] quenvin: I like to be articulate in crayon
[5:05:00] gambleragain: its mandatory not to use uhm and ems in news
[5:05:11] Dragaar13: it sounds robotic
[5:05:24] popCatter: i meant
[5:05:28] popCatter: as a back and forth
[5:05:49] Piktorr: did you end up doing a 29? had to leave stream for a few
[5:05:56] Mutepanda: Depends how comfortable the person is ommiting the ums and uhs
[5:05:57] astreinoid: it is a learnable skill, to allow the silence inbetween words to remain. but if you dont care about filler words.. why learn to leave them out
[5:06:11] BizBichou: hey nagoogoo how many times have we depleted Rise today Chatting
[5:06:13] gambleragain: in esports it kinda flows with uhms and ems, but in television casting you have to be fluent nad fluid
[5:06:26] pingafest: hey Nag, what WA or addon you use to see the m+ mob ability cd icon next to there health bar?

[5:06:28] Sangomah: If you can avoid uhms and "ahs" in conversations, people take you more seriously. Its better to take pauses without any sound, which is a good thing as it gives the listener time to take things in. If there is constant sound, it can be distractin for the overall message of the conversation
[5:06:36] kaverrr: a good pause where you just stare is always fun
[5:06:43] LaazorzZ: There is a little trick to speak without filler words: talk a bit slower and use pauses instead of filelr words :D

[5:09:34] Sangomah: In communication studies, Interrupting to get your word in is called "The Spanish Method" LUL
[5:09:35] Astralix_WoW: nice valdraken game play every time i join strem
[5:09:36] filipgreen7: that's why i play priest i can't interrupt so i can't be rude anytime :)
[5:09:48] BizBichou: are we listening to tettles' emo list again today Catting

[5:20:42] Elembry_us: I'm debating boomkin alt.. my main is a resto druid so gearing would be easier.
[5:21:11] gambleragain: ngl, going from disc healer into aug is sooooo much less stresfull
[5:21:16] Piktorr: prefer dev over aug
[5:21:36] xcmari: DinoDance

[5:22:47] Piktorr: I’m almost all 22s across the board. Hard pugging keys though. hit or miss
[5:22:48] krasiqn: as healer my best is 22 tott

[5:23:33] Piktorr: yes
[5:23:37] zeelowqq: volume settings - ring vs notification
[5:23:52] Piktorr: go into your notification settings
[5:24:07] gambleragain: @elembryus i heal pugs most of the time, and lately i joined a guild, and holy shit what a difference, Kicks are much better, aoe stops as well.
[5:24:36] luxxyLux_: Doing great, I was looking for a balance druid player who is streaming so i can improve my game and found you :-)
[5:24:44] zeelowqq: @Piktorr is right about the vibrate - that's in notification settings I thinkl.
[5:24:51] luxxyLux_: drood*
[5:24:56] Piktorr: BloodTrail what I look like after healing a high key haha
[5:25:51] gambleragain: high keys require so much prep tho it takes the fun out of it, the only satisfaction is timing it
[5:26:30] popCatter: 20 more score achieved
[5:26:47] popCatter: we done any keys since i checked in last?
[5:26:51] popCatter: or endless lfg
[5:26:59] Elembry_us: We are watching Naguura pug higher keys, however, pugs are hit or miss on organizing mechanics.
[5:27:01] Stricken79: I never could pug all by myself 24/7, I've run with guild since legion for m+

[5:27:33] gambleragain: currently im stuck in this mood of, 20s are waste of time and 25+ are the goal
[5:27:52] Piktorr: I’ve been pugging all my higher keys, gets frustrating but I keep trucking lol
[5:28:12] Elembry_us: I have pugged twice this season. Pugged the beginning of S2 until all I heard was how much of a crap healer I am and people telling me to do bad things to myself. So only guild runs it was.
[5:28:12] galdrelvolkfire: @rabe1992 Yes, its ret, Naguura is heals and they still need a tank
[5:28:21] Piktorr: gotta hit that 3k IO
[5:28:47] AlphasaurusRexx: anyone know what mouse she uses? my g600 died and cant get a replacement

[5:28:57] StreamElements: Zowie EC2-C
[5:29:04] AlphasaurusRexx: thanks
[5:30:07] Stricken79: I don't think Naguura uses an mmo mouse though, not a sidepad style one
[5:30:08] gambleragain: i kinda vibe with rets, so much support in dungeon
[5:30:49] gambleragain: if healing gets streful they bubble, plus if they get legendary its 10% of their dmg

[5:34:33] xVECTAx: Can you boost my +2 key
[5:35:12] mikkelreb0rn: There's a WA to remove the nameplates of vines tho?
[5:35:17] MBG_95: I think you can probably filter them off with Plater no?
[5:35:20] mikkelreb0rn: havent had any lags at all
[5:35:30] Yanoru: Its a Plater issue, not directly the game.
[5:35:47] soge131: @MBG_95 Yeah, I already got the plater script to not see them
[5:36:03] Yanoru: There is a weak aura that disables the plater plates on Tindral roots.
[5:36:16] Lenietwitch: some people has been turning off details and appreantly that helped
[5:36:33] Mg_cs: pretty sure that the nameplates are still being renderd but just with 100% transparency so it shouldn't really help the CPU, might be wrong on that tho
[5:36:40] Yanoru: Im playing with Blizz Plates and I dont have any lags at all @ Tyndral roots.
[5:36:42] MBG_95: Details definitely uses a lot, can also just turn down the refresh rate of it updating
[5:36:52] Mutepanda: It amazes me you know what is going on with all the health bars in big mobs with the addons.
[5:37:03] Frreppy: I'm turning nameplates off but it's still lagging, I guess logging also making it worse

[5:37:54] soge131: So, I'll disable plater and stop logging for that boss, will share results next week NOTED
[5:37:58] soge131: Tyvm
[5:38:02] Piktorr: my only issue is on fyrak, plater won’t let me click the healing adds anymore with their bars
[5:38:16] Piktorr: TableHere
[5:38:54] MBG_95: @Piktorr why would you not just click the model rather than trying to click their nameplate?
[5:38:59] MBG_95: its a much easier click
[5:39:03] xVECTAx: how is the skiing going
[5:39:45] Piktorr: well yeah I do that in place but the other ones get in the way sometimes lol
[5:39:49] gambleragain: dude, its my 2nd week in retail, and i hate afflicted and incorp
[5:39:51] popCatter: popCat TeaTime
[5:40:06] Tenivir: LUL
[5:40:14] xVECTAx: What are daily tickets on your areas for ski resorts?
[5:40:22] steroiids22: is it worth switching na to eu for high keys?
[5:40:23] Kuroz: ski talk : 10 % skiing 90 alcohol
[5:40:27] Piktorr: @gambleragain you’ll get used to it lol having peeps assigned to em helps
[5:40:28] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[5:40:29] jokaja: Those are good friends
[5:40:33] KDaily: ski drinking all about the nips
[5:41:04] steroiids22: anyone have any input?
[5:41:45] Lenietwitch: is terrible, no one is tanking or healing :(
[5:41:45] TiPera: MDI practice
[5:41:50] OlaF_oo: bloody shit on the floor
[5:41:51] MBG_95: Sanguine is not hard, but big coggy load so no fun

[5:41:55] Gnolde: sanguine week...also...palworld
[5:41:59] shantihi: Dps are padders
[5:41:59] Elembry_us: @gambleragain It's nice when you're in a group that understands afflicted isn't just a healer affix. Especially, in certain dungeons where our dispel has to be focused on party members. As a druid healing them is a pita, however, I can do it.

[5:42:17] Kuroz: do you know high key pushers on eu, do you play afternoon NA time, eu prime time?
[5:42:22] Kuroz: a bunch of considerations
[5:42:24] heyhannah: depends what region you're in, I'm EU in NA and there is sometimes high ping to take into account
[5:42:34] steroiids22: i think theres more of a player base pushing 26 and higher

[5:42:54] StreamElements: How I made my Tirolmas music video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dou_wVvgtXs
[5:42:58] steroiids22: ya ur 5 hrs ahead of me
[5:43:03] soge131: I know it's not something simple to do, but I think they should look to improve healer/tanks quality of life so more people are interesting in playing those roles
[5:43:13] steroiids22: 120ms i think
[5:43:15] soge131: interested*
[5:43:22] LtJenkins: I don't think switching regions will solve an issue like that. Maybe if you're already a top .1% pusher NA and you've reach your limit NA, then maybe swapping EU can you get that extra push.
[5:43:31] jokaja: I started playing while living in mexico and now that i lived in germany i considered moving my account, but then you loose all mounts, achievements etc :( So i still play in LA servers
[5:43:58] Elembry_us: A lot of people rerolled dps in S2 because of how crap pugging those roles were
[5:44:10] lordbelar: Tired of all the ... "go" go  "GO"  jerks.
[5:44:10] steroiids22: im just finding getting passed 2400 on na is rough not many people pushing them, and if they are they have a team
[5:44:18] xVECTAx: what is that glyph that allows you not to be in moonkin form and shines around ur char? :)
[5:44:19] Tenivir: yeah 4 tanks per 20 people is not a thing in raiding
[5:44:23] Tenivir: but it would be for m+
[5:44:41] JohnAllenCasts: I wonder what the ratios are like up and down the rio ladder. like at 3k you'll have all the 3.5k alts
[5:44:51] ThexDirtyxBird: @xvectax I think it's called Astral Form
[5:44:53] JohnAllenCasts: at 2.7k you'll probably have quite a lot of alt tanks
[5:45:14] Golden_Snack: @Naguura still not ready to play together? :D
[5:45:17] ngaiowalker: @xvectax Glyph of Stars
[5:45:20] soge131: Yeah, 1-1-3 vs 1-2-7 (2-4-14)
[5:45:23] Lenietwitch: @JohnAllenCasts not really, is as hard as it is in high keys to find tanks / healers in low keys, is just not rewarding at all
[5:45:31] Elembry_us: Pug groups for raid struggle to find healers
[5:45:46] Sajtox: 13-23
[5:45:56] Tenivir: yeah if you make that into m+ its 7 dps for 1 tank
[5:45:58] Tenivir: LUL
[5:46:08] BriGuy271: girl, your ones are weird
[5:46:26] megazeusthor: little tent 1s
[5:46:33] MBG_95: healers is more the pressure is all on you instead of spread
[5:46:39] Blackoutx187x: Haha
[5:46:40] Sajtox: 1 per group essentially for healers
[5:46:45] Golden_Snack: @Naguura still not ready to play together?
[5:46:45] Blackoutx187x: I see the tents
[5:46:46] Azniux: 2.7~
[5:46:50] soge131: 1 to 2.8~~
[5:46:56] overlyintelligent: Its also 1 -> 3 if we round it
[5:47:04] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:47:19] Elembry_us: There is a lot of pressure on healers. That's why I mostly run with my guild bc we know each others play styles and use it to our benefit.
[5:47:35] ruv3l: The attitude of many players against tanks or healers sucks. It's always their fault even tho dps is pulling more because they think they know best. One mistake on route/mobs is causing dps to leave...
[5:47:49] averlane2: 10% of people being happy to switch role is all you need to sort this out
[5:48:01] toozveelahm: healer is most stressful job in M+ (it used to be tanks, which was super yikes cause if tanks weren’t OP it’s not fun)
[5:48:15] Cocotao: Tanking in raid is so boring compared to tanking in m+
[5:48:24] Elembry_us: ugh.. DPS pulling pisses off every tank and they normally drop. Then bc the tank dropped for dps being out of line, they blame me for crap healing being the reason.
[5:48:47] Golden_Snack: !btag
[5:49:43] lordbelar: Start kicking entire group if a group joins and tank/healer leave, then they should all be kicked.
[5:50:19] little_c2222: Yeah
[5:50:25] Thalna1993: !tirolmas
[5:50:25] StreamElements: How I made my Tirolmas music video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dou_wVvgtXs
[5:50:46] shantihi: You also need the trinkets to tank higher keys which you don't normally roll for.
[5:50:48] little_c2222: I sure wouldnt
[5:51:18] overlyintelligent: In my opinion, its easier to hide mistakes as a DPS compared to a healer or tank in M+ And I think its relatable that some people dont want to have the responsibility
[5:51:38] diana1850: are we taking in account all the players that don't do m+ at all
[5:51:39] metrok123: what speaks against increasing the normaldungeon size to 10 players?
[5:51:54] fumii_tv: can u tell blizz to hurry up with maintenance
[5:51:59] Elembry_us: 2 out of the 3 main tanks in my guild are willing to switch roles. 1 refuses because he despises DPS. 1 just has a tank as an alt if we need one.
[5:52:04] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:52:24] JohnAllenCasts: There's also a lot of reasearch that goes into tanking. like learning roots the first weeks of a season
[5:52:25] little_c2222: It's harder
[5:52:35] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[5:52:37] overlyintelligent: Yea its def not only one reason
[5:52:40] JohnAllenCasts: especially if you're a pug tank since nobody knows what's going on
[5:52:55] Mutepanda: The responsibility, getting dumped on if things go wrong, un-fun classes in those roles, etc.
[5:52:57] fennrirq: @Naguura tank needs to learn routes, % etc dps just needs to dps KEKHeim
[5:53:12] Elembry_us: People don't give tanks a break week 1 of the season. They just expect them to be pros in the dungeon.
[5:53:19] tulk0n: you could fix the issue with Mithyc Raid 10 man. (same ratio with M+)
[5:53:44] Mayder: nah worst thing ever is definitely boomy in low tyrant key KEKLEO
[5:53:45] theskot: the worst is when people try and backseat tanks
[5:53:54] little_c2222: Yeah
[5:53:55] Blusax79: I kind of like tanking in pugs on my alt... but just because i learn alot
[5:54:03] wolviecb: tell me about it... it's almost like doing ah follower dungeon, but with crippled AI
[5:54:15] Elembry_us: Boomies struggle in lower keys, but shine in higher keys.

[5:54:32] soge131: @elembryus "Hey why aren't you doing the route I've seen this player play in the beta? 4Head " Actual comment I got in Dragonflight week 1
[5:54:56] fennrirq: BibleThump
[5:54:59] ShelviJ: ?
[5:55:03] Elembry_us: @soge131 That's ridiculous to me. Tanks aren't gods. Give them time. Jeez
[5:55:07] Frreppy: Yep, responsibility is a thing, I've tried disc instead of sp (wasn't healing at all for a long time), and it's frustrating when any mistake I make is almost always is a wipe BibleThump
[5:55:08] little_c2222: Intolerant!
[5:55:08] Lennerrt: resonable
[5:55:12] fennrirq: but for 20+ it makes sense
[5:55:17] overlyintelligent: Sounds about right KEKW
[5:55:23] Blusax79: hahaha... if i were tanking I would just be like... thanks for helping me dodge that bullet
[5:55:31] ruv3l: And then they wonder why there aren't enough tanks
[5:55:32] sim967: I remember that, you left right after ?
[5:55:40] Kuroz: twitch chat after agreed with the kick for 15/20 minutes
[5:55:42] Elembry_us: @Frreppy People don't use damage mitigation.. EVER and expect me to keep them alive.
[5:55:42] maozsi: I stopped healing once both DPSing as healer and drinking was forbidden during M+ runs.
[5:55:43] AngryEvilCookie: tanks should start key with words like: 1k gold each prepaid
[5:55:45] fennrirq: imagine your tank getting lost when you need to time KEKHeim
[5:55:47] hatecreation103: and after ppl complain ''where are all the tanks omg'' lol
[5:55:48] wolviecb: @ruv3l it never makes sense to treat people like this
[5:56:02] little_c2222: And that's why we have follower dungeons. Cuz of intolerance
[5:56:13] ghantous: i have pugged every IO key and ive played healer tank and dps 3200-3400, theres no comparison of how much more relaxed it is to just play dps. people dont undestand too that Tanks dont get a different perspective of a dungeon because they always tank and its their route
[5:56:15] ruv3l: @wolviecb definitly not, we all play the game to have fun
[5:56:17] Fuzziew: I wish Blizz would give tanks more kicks so the DPS didn't have to do that either. Seems fair
[5:56:17] Gamerhcp: hello Caro naguuraHypers
[5:56:18] LtJenkins: I don't know...I'm a tank and if I feel if I had one job, it's having a route ready.   I think there's a big difference between coming prepared with a route and okaying it with a group, but then coming in on like a 27 asking "do you guys have a route"
[5:56:26] fennrirq: @Naguura or couple times we had 98% and we need to go all the way back that suckd
[5:56:29] MBG_95: if you know the dungeons, you can do any route, doesnt matter if its your route or not :D
[5:56:35] y0rge: you do
[5:56:37] Kuroz: pepePHONE @Gamerhcp
[5:56:39] bareuheldig: think theyre confusing understanding how to deal with mobs and knowing the best routes for each affix
[5:56:40] y0rge: cus you need know all you pull
[5:56:41] ruv3l: We have the ping system so somebody can who the way?
[5:56:43] y0rge: how much you pull
[5:56:47] maozsi: And didn't tank 'cause ppl want me to need no heals so healer could dps
[5:56:48] ruv3l: who = show
[5:56:56] lordbelar: More is better.
[5:57:02] itsClubby: woah woah woah
[5:57:04] Elembry_us: I was in a 15 and the tank asked if they could try a new route. It went complete crap, but no one dropped. We were okay with it.
[5:57:04] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:57:05] Mayder: D:
[5:57:09] Frreppy: @elembryus And no interrupts on top of it LUL
[5:57:11] MBG_95: @y0rge its called, looking at the route and pulling it, doesnt mean it has to be the tanks own route to begin with
[5:57:15] fennrirq: @Naguura naowh said MDT is 90% of a tank being good SeemsGood
[5:57:19] Lenietwitch: most of the times pulls will be very similar tbh
[5:57:22] xVECTAx: a good tank is a tank, dps are always the toxic ones
[5:57:26] soge131: As a tank you should be able to see a route and say : "Yeah, that can work" or "Absolutely no way I can do that", specially when some routes use things not every tank has.
[5:57:32] Elembry_us: @Frreppy Yeah.. My incap roar and typhoon is over used
[5:57:33] Yoshibellbel: There is a difference between having someone else link you a better route than your own and playing it vs. not playing a route at all
[5:57:36] Blusax79: i would let the tank choose the route... in all situations unless they were completely high
[5:57:37] Justflux: Even the top tanks sometimes just open mdt mid boss fight if theres nothing to do to make sure
[5:57:38] TiPera: A good tank will for sure do the route but it doesn't mean he will survive every pull :D
[5:57:41] Justflux: its not rocket science
[5:57:43] killscripts: I must be a bad tank.... lol
[5:57:47] ordhah: If my healer wants me to tank a different route I just do it on the fly. All you need to do as tank is make sure % is good and you keep rotating defensives and putting out cc. It isn't hard to adapt.
[5:57:49] ruv3l: Yes i agree to that!
[5:58:00] lordbelar: So, your the tank?
[5:58:05] Fuzziew: I think its a fair question since DPS may have a better route suited for their groups CD's.
[5:58:12] LtJenkins: @Yoshibellbel Exactly. This is my opinion as well. Coming in with 0 and asking the group for the route in a really high key is not something I would do
[5:58:26] Piktorr: I’ve been with tanks did totally different route, +2 the key. Your right tank just has to be confident and adapt
[5:58:36] xVECTAx: naguura just started WW3
[5:58:38] fennrirq: @Naguura oh he said about planning in MDT
[5:58:42] Justflux: chatters be chattin
[5:58:49] TiPera: well ur tanking about of one of the best tanks in the game, not pugs
[5:58:51] Elembry_us: So far when I've given a suggestion, the tank has run with it. Mostly because it makes my life easier as a healer and they like the idea of that.
[5:58:52] Cyppz: na chat?
[5:58:54] TiPera: talking*
[5:58:56] Lennerrt: ofc he would be able
[5:58:57] Truedream92: he can insta
[5:58:57] grimmakyr: It PUG PTSD not the tanks fault, people grind a key to good level and dont wanna risk to a tank that seems unsure
[5:58:58] popCatter: quantChatting
[5:59:21] MBG_95: I cant understand this chat
[5:59:23] MBG_95: its wild
[5:59:25] astreinoid: some dungeons are a bit weird with % though and it can f u up at the end if you do not check every little mob. like missing 1 count at end of rise :)
[5:59:27] ghantous: once you have done a key 20-30 times u know exactly every mob its 100% easy to adapt any route u just visualize it
[5:59:28] wolviecb: you trying to get DPS being accountable Carol, they really get mad when you do that
[5:59:29] Amresh: LUL
[5:59:32] matt_xiv: i think people disagree with you on purpose to start an argument
[5:59:40] overlyintelligent: Tbh Robin would die randomly somewhere and says UPPSSSS KEKW
[5:59:43] itsClubby: Uh oh we've hit the EU "Yeah" at the end of every sentence, you lot are in trouble
[5:59:45] Fuzziew: Imagine getting angry at a VIDEO game lol
[5:59:46] overlyintelligent: or he would miss a bird or so
[5:59:50] DjUrsu: i forget the way from dungeon portal to the first pack. You want now to remember a different route just by looking at it ?
[5:59:52] Kuroz: the same person that justified it back then*
[5:59:58] Piktorr: mortal kombat!!!!!
[5:59:58] grimmakyr: It's becuase people suddenly doubt their conficdence whether its right or wrong thats the reason
[6:00:00] popCatter: chatters Chatting
[6:00:01] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[6:00:04] wolviecb: tanking is when no questions
[6:00:04] darthritus: nono nagurra spitting rn
[6:00:06] lordbelar: and that is why tanks stop.
[6:00:07] darthritus: tanks are dog
[6:00:09] Sgt_Tokin: LOL im dying here, this is so good
[6:00:10] astreinoid: i prefer to get some route ideas from others.. it is hard to experience different routes if you always tank your own runs
[6:00:10] Mutepanda: An unteachable tank is a bad tank.
[6:00:13] soge131: Tank: Tries to communicate. Leader : So I took that personally
[6:00:14] pekman6969: i think the tank should have the route in aa high key or ?
[6:00:16] fennrirq: @Naguura imagine if you hired a plummer and he asked if yuu have a good hammer at home he can use KEKHeim
[6:00:16] Jothor83: how they dare trying to ask to improve their knowledge they should know everythign jsut like me Kappa
[6:00:21] Razzeu: pugs are just weird Despairge (im perma tanking pugs high keys)
[6:00:25] Elembry_us: Which I have an issues with. I don't think that's okay. The tank has a right a ask party members opinions. That shows a tank that is considerate of their team for that dungeon.
[6:00:27] Fiestacado: SeemsGood
[6:00:28] killscripts: This is why I only do m+ with friends
[6:00:28] xseba02: pala prot or dh tank at mdi?
[6:00:29] Toxikk_Tankk: my jam
[6:00:34] StockerFock: i mean, i wouldnt trust a dps with boiling some water, after all we just run after the tank an smash SMOrc
[6:00:37] Blusax79: nope... i don't justify that... but if someone is a person who would kick a tank in that situation you are doing the tank a favor... that tank will have another group in 2 minutes
[6:00:37] gzus81: wow
[6:00:37] Justflux: @xseba02 dh 100p
[6:00:38] popCatter: KEKW
[6:00:38] grimmakyr: haha
[6:00:39] Ruhrpottman: There u can see why the game is so toxic in pug grps :D
[6:00:39] Mayder: KEKW
[6:00:42] Lennerrt: LUL
[6:00:43] pekman6969: its literlarly the same
[6:00:45] DjUrsu: it's not about executing the route, it's about remembering the route just by looking 1 time at it
[6:00:47] popCatter: what the hell is that take
[6:00:48] popCatter: KEKW
[6:00:51] wolviecb: imagine hiring a plumber and he asks where is the leak
[6:00:52] Mutepanda: That deserves a ban SwiftRage
[6:00:55] itsClubby: We'll decide if its better Naguura Kappa
[6:00:56] AngryEvilCookie: when I played, we was happy for any tank/healer rofl
[6:00:56] grimmakyr: Suspect
[6:01:00] Yoshibellbel: I think there is a miscommunication here. Asking for a route, because you don't have one in a high key AT ALL is kind of a bad sign. HOWEVER, asking for a better route than what you have played previously, is totally fine and acceptable and a smart idea.
[6:01:09] pekman6969: then i kick the the plumber out of my house
[6:01:12] smashiii123: Chat not understanding that different classes have different CD times and need other routes to optimize.
[6:01:14] pekman6969: and let the other 4 cook
[6:01:14] bareuheldig: its not their job apparently
[6:01:21] grimmakyr: 5 plumbers one problem aye ^^
[6:01:21] AngryEvilCookie: they are so rare, that any tank is good, just run anywhere who cares :D
[6:01:24] y0rge: @Naguura how many time as dps you did mdi route for party ?
[6:01:25] TtsstTV: can dps not use their brain and have a route? after all sometimes u queue ur own key as dps or? imagine actually using brain to come up with a plan for the own key
[6:01:27] popCatter: KEKW
[6:01:30] chaarp: why is it the tanks responsibility to provide the route always?
[6:01:30] Mayder: stunlocked Naguura classic
[6:01:31] Mutepanda: Or a plumber runs into a pipe he hasn't seen before and asks another plumber if they've dealt with that piping before.
[6:01:34] Elembry_us: @Naguura I'd leave a party if the tank was removed for that reason.
[6:01:34] Sgt_Tokin: Chat just working you up haha
[6:01:35] saintnutricious: listen I have 2000 rating I think I know what I'm talking about here
[6:01:35] Piktorr: trolls
[6:01:40] popCatter: im crying laughing rn KEKW
[6:01:42] itsClubby: I forgot what her point was about plumbers can we go back to that
[6:01:42] overlyintelligent: The best tanks are the 3 mob andys anyway and when told to pull bigger they just pull everyhting
[6:01:55] Jothor83: trying to improve your knowledge in any situation should never be frowned above
[6:02:03] ItsUrBuddyJake: Mythic routes are only the tanks job... dps job is just show up and kill shit
[6:02:04] Justflux: no chatting unles high io please (2k+)

[6:02:06] Blusax79: i don't mind an adjustment to the route but if it wipes the group... its no longer on the tank
[6:02:09] Elembry_us: I won't heal for people who do crap like that. Find another one.
[6:02:11] OdyssaQ: Naowh is a good plummer... and has a hammer... got it! naguuraGiggle
[6:02:18] popCatter: Yep
[6:02:18] Razzeu: YEP
[6:02:21] bareuheldig: wonder what those type of people think of dps suggesting route changes
[6:02:24] y0rge: healer is worse
[6:02:24] Vendrek: When you sign up as a tank you sign up as the point person of the platoon
[6:02:27] overlyintelligent: YEP
[6:02:29] StockerFock: imagine having a 3800rated healer in your group but the tank not taking suggestions for the route because hes not playing tank
[6:02:29] Sgt_Tokin: hahaha

[6:02:36] y0rge: tank can fuqed up dps can fuqed up
[6:02:41] y0rge: but if heal do is over
[6:02:46] Mutepanda: incorrect @Vendrek
[6:02:46] grimmakyr: I used to tank and now i don't, it's the start of the season that is grief, frist key everyone wants you to know it all xD
[6:02:48] ruv3l: it's always the hunters!
[6:02:48] soge131: @chaarp I mean, it's partially true that you must know the route beforehand, just so you know you'll be able to survive it, since sometimes you want to pull as much as the tank can handle.
[6:02:48] Elembry_us: @y0rge How is healer worse?
[6:03:03] Razzeu: one of my favorite examples is tanking EB and pala not freedom/monk no lust and VR on cd AND not kicking
[6:03:07] y0rge: cus all blame healer id they die
[6:03:08] Razzeu: into blaming me ICANT
[6:03:24] MBG_95: @y0rge not even, the number of fights you can live without a healer is crazy, everyone has responsibility
[6:03:30] Vendrek: @Mutepanda  LUL Hahaha LUL ...
[6:03:55] Zapzoda: healers have the least responsibility imo

[6:04:46] sim967: the big irony is that’s why dps get the long queues for m+ dungeons, by chasing away the tanks or healers.
[6:04:55] Thalna1993: Do you think keys shouldnt be depleated so ppl can practice routes and comps?? or at least have a more lives or sth
[6:05:00] Zapzoda: @sim967 so true

[6:23:47] ayaan0908: Lol I made one to on my other phone
[6:23:59] itsClubby: im always clubbing
[6:24:23] zster97: thats fair lol
[6:24:45] LightdarkGaming: well I saw a rogue with 1 kick overall when he was 3100 rio :D and I see people like these  quite a bit in 22 range
[6:24:46] bielich132: people join a pug, deplete it and call randoms boosted :D
[6:24:47] shale93: nowadays you do a mistake in key and people call you boosted
[6:24:57] itsClubby: ok but what is your opinion on flavour of the month inflated IO specs
[6:25:03] yenny__: if you smash your head into the wall in M+ its very viable to fall upwards
[6:25:12] germando1979: i agree once they get the achievement they dont run the high keys
[6:25:23] smashhammer: I had a bear tank yesterday in a DHT +20 with over 3k score who only pressed barkskin 3 times the whole dungeon
[6:25:30] Zapzoda: how do you get those teleport spells anyway
[6:25:34] ayaan0908: Lol just made a playlist
[6:25:36] bielich132: @itsClubby its easier to get io. but you still gotta play the game somehow to time +28s
[6:25:54] astreinoid: there are some medium high people that are like the 5th wheel in every dungeon they are in...  but have a lot of time
[6:26:02] popCatter: @Zapzoda +20 a dungeon earns the tp for that dungeon
[6:26:07] zster97: yeah they prob arent boosted, that was def an exaggeration
[6:26:15] soge131: To be fair, you can do a lot of mistakes and still +2 a 20
[6:26:17] zster97: just bad
[6:26:25] Zapzoda: @popcatter ohhhh ok I didn’t know that
[6:26:26] bielich132: @soge131 you can 3man +20s...
[6:26:27] jlaw_89: 20 key is high for me

[6:28:49] LightdarkGaming: pressing incarn, then die, def boosted Kappa
[6:29:27] stryftek: Oh, you guys not no lust?
[6:29:46] bielich132: naguura playing no lust keys all day :D
[6:29:50] Elembry_us: It's the healers fault first. Then the tank. Never the DPS messing up mechanics. Not saying healers and tanks aren't guilty of it. They are. But it's never 100% my fault.
[6:30:05] LtJenkins: I play prot paladin and those things are why I love the class. Can spot heal, bop someone, sac, infinite interrupts, a great stun, cleanse, bres. Prot pala carries so hard
[6:30:47] ruv3l: One important question, do you have your particles settings set to low? Or did they really change the blue ring for DH sigil to green?
[6:30:49] Thalinan: sorry but no. its actually the healers vault first, then tank, then OTHER dps except me, then my mom, dad, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, and then maybe just maybe, my dog.
[6:31:06] Zapzoda: @ltjenkins it really does it’s the carry tank
[6:31:14] Synthatt: @ruv3l The visual on elysian decree was changed
[6:31:19] soge131: @Thalinan You forgot society, sometimes it's just society's fault classic
[6:31:23] jlaw_89: thanks coach @Naguura
[6:31:28] deano0417: If you always think other people are the problem, you are the problem basically :)
[6:31:37] germando1979: i hate it when the tank expects us dps to interupt...i mean we are trying to do damage here
[6:31:44] Lennerrt: thats getting too real im not ready for that LUL
[6:31:45] ruv3l: @Synthatt thank you, i thought it was just me :P

[6:32:35] Synthatt: @ruv3l Lol np. They changed a lot of the old SL visuals to make them more consistent with class fantasy
[6:32:51] Elembry_us: I take fault when it is my fault. No point in blaming others for my failure.
[6:32:53] ruv3l: i did like the blue tho hehe
[6:33:13] RoyalCorvidGaming: What playlist is this? It's a bop
[6:33:30] Synthatt: @ruv3l Fae stomp (now called jadefire stomp) looks amazing now though!
[6:33:37] Elembry_us: @synthatt they made adaptive swarm look like a fart cloud... I freaking hate it
[6:34:02] Synthatt: @elembryus Yeah swarm is kinda weird
[6:34:29] Ian_m94: Do you feel there should be some kind of penalty for when people leave a kay before the timer has expired? Or even a vote to end early? Forcing a pug to the end if the key expires for practice could be difficult for a lot of groups unless you're with friends
[6:34:35] Elembry_us: Can't wait for glyphs so I can change it back. I don't like surrounding my team members in a fart cloud
[6:34:54] RoyalCorvidGaming: People b eing toxic andjust leaving in the middle of keys ect is why I don't do keys very often
[6:34:54] Zapzoda: @elembryus what class do you play
[6:34:55] Synthatt: And shifting power make you feel like you're getting flashbanged if your graphics are turned up
[6:35:02] Elembry_us: Resto Druid
[6:35:14] Zapzoda: @elembryus oo cute
[6:35:22] Lenietwitch: at the end of the day you can only contorl your own actions, so you might as well think how to improve instead of looking for blame :D
[6:35:28] LightdarkGaming: u can always hearthstone out:D
[6:35:39] TiPera: they should improve the system imo
[6:35:56] Zapzoda: @royalcorvidgaming it’s very annoying when people do that
[6:35:58] Elembry_us: Is it weird I ask the party how I can improve as a healer after a key?
[6:36:08] LopieTV: They should let you reinforce your keystones with crests or flightstones to make them immune to deplete 1 time
[6:36:59] RoyalCorvidGaming: @Zapzoda it really is and it makes me not want to push content when toxicity is so... rampent. Given I've played since TBC but still. It's difficult when everyone craps on everyone else. I just wanna do my feral druid thing lol and watch numbers go brr and avoid things.

[6:37:12] Zapzoda: if you leave a key everyone’s key drops 1 level
[6:37:33] Medjuza: @Zapzoda So u can just go into a key and grief others?
[6:37:43] Medjuza: Doesnt sound like a great system
[6:38:06] Thalinan: @Naguura thoughts on aug this season? how necessary do you think they are to most comps for keys 26+ compared to last season?
[6:38:16] Sweetmat_34: nah cause that will make pushing key way too easy
[6:38:27] spontie: chill 25 AD for sure)
[6:38:29] pootystomp: rezan is a powerful loa
[6:38:36] soge131: I'd rather have a menu where you can select to run any key level you have already timed +1
[6:38:39] Ian_m94: It could be as simple as a timed ban from joining another mythic, let's say 5 mins for example. Then if you keep leaving without completing or at least have a majority vote to end it early that ban timer increases. Or a reputation system to identify players that are more likely to leave, like player x leaves 43% of their mythic dungeons before it expires etc
[6:38:43] soge131: But that's asking too much
[6:38:45] Zapzoda: @royalcorvidgaming yeah, M+ is full of toxic people and trolls. its fun but can be super frustrating
[6:39:22] Synthatt: I feel like it's a difficult balancing act. Because if keys below 20 don't deplete, people may try to bully someone into leaving if the key can't be timed
[6:39:26] Cyberkaia_: best way to doit its League system,, Just vote for surrender, and ppl tahta just leave, be punish
[6:39:34] LightdarkGaming: do u rly understand though:D u play all day, u loose half an hour, its nothing
[6:39:37] Dunkhart: I only want to play m+ if i win RAGEY
[6:39:43] TotallyNotRaien: not just reasonable, its what the whole system is making players do
[6:39:50] Zapzoda: @cyberkaia_ this could be good
[6:40:40] TotallyNotRaien: imo keys should give you 2-3 attempt before depleting
[6:40:42] LightdarkGaming: yeh but people are leacing even if u say its a weekly key
[6:40:49] OlaF_oo: score not mattering until the end of the season is a 1% way of think tbh, which means it is not true for most players which never get close to the title anyway
[6:41:18] LightdarkGaming: there is plenty of pugs that say "weekly, stay till end" and they leave mid run cause they died
[6:41:23] Zapzoda: they say that. they will say “for completion”
[6:41:25] spontie: they know that if they will text "weekly", strong players will not join to carry them
[6:41:28] Elembry_us: My goal is 3k this season.
[6:41:34] Aegatron: tjenare Caro, me back
[6:41:37] MBG_95: @Zapzoda 99% do not state this
[6:41:43] Dunkhart: NODDERS @LightdarkGaming
[6:41:48] stryftek: I want HEALS on your Details - not 2 damage done please!!!!
[6:41:57] t4pekid: From my experience even with „Completion“ in the name doesnt mean people will stay after one wipe lmao
[6:41:58] Zapzoda: @mbg_95 I see it often
[6:42:05] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[6:42:19] Cyberkaia_: But @Naguura 1% are 2900+io, so its not all of us playing fo pushing.  alot of ppl are still trying to get there. thats why i still think that the best solution its league system, just vote for surrender, and if anyone leave get punish, low queue, cant play for X tuime, whatever
[6:42:26] RoyalCorvidGaming: the amount of my own keys that have been bricked because someone left after one death is... annoying lol
[6:42:29] Suplazin: i feel like if youre doing just a 20 key its more of a vault key
[6:42:31] Rancidius: I got a chopper in the car
[6:42:33] kyodragon1573: This is why I don't like group content, I think morally you should care about everyone in your group.  In group content it shouldn't be individual desires and need anymore

[6:42:37] Suplazin: 21+ is for pushing
[6:43:10] ruv3l: What is the spotify playlist? They where posted, but can't find them anymore
[6:43:27] Cyberkaia_: @Suplazin tbh 21 are for vault, the difference between 23 and 24 keys its where pushing start IMO
[6:43:51] Synthatt: Maybe implement some kind of "vote to deplete" system. If majority of party votes to deplete, you can leave without penalty. Otherwise, you're penalized for leaving
[6:44:01] ayaan0908: I'm back
[6:44:12] puntualus: completion
[6:44:26] Cyberkaia_: yeah totally agree, im playing for push.. not for completition, if the key owner or group, says its for completittion.. i just not queue on that
[6:44:27] Pallavos: The normal thing is to wanna finish the key. So if u wanna leave if its depleted u should say it in adnvance.
[6:44:32] Dunkhart: It goes both ways imo. If you will leave on deplete you should also say that you will leave if you don't time the key. NODDERS
[6:44:36] darthhelmett: @Naguura BASED
[6:44:39] ayaan0908: I'm back
[6:44:41] lrome_xkak: the player leaving is not always the one being inconsiderate and selfish
[6:44:45] Jetofficially: youre never wrong for making decisions that assist you in moving forward.
[6:44:49] lrome_xkak: punishing only them wouldn't make sense
[6:44:50] kyodragon1573: if its not stated you could also ask what goal is
[6:45:03] skeletonetiquette: That's why we have completion and normal in listing yeah?
[6:45:04] sveikthewarlock: people just dont even utilise the goal option where it says completion or beat timer
[6:45:26] Jetofficially: you cant punish them for leaving
[6:45:33] Jetofficially: it doesnt matter the reason
[6:45:38] soge131: But goal "finish it even if untimed" can mean : Yeah, 10 min deplete is ok or 5 hours in you're still progressing a boss
[6:45:47] Lenietwitch: a people of 3-4 can take you hostage, that would be sooooo bad
[6:45:49] ruv3l: Many people should be reading up on Circle of Influence. It would make life lots easier for some.
[6:45:52] Liferuiner06: vote for it
[6:45:55] Hugejorma: Vote
[6:45:57] Cyberkaia_: @Pallavos at 25-27 keys you just wanna play for IO, if not gonna get it timed.. just leave ndo not waste  20-30 min
[6:46:10] esceti95: sure there are avarage times for all key lvls also avarage deaths in a key jkust base it on that
[6:46:18] esceti95: ai pretty smart these days
[6:46:21] Jetofficially: you could have a leave count on a player which would assist in the group leader making a decision ont he invite
[6:46:27] Jothor83: maybe make the LFG page asks you to tick a box saying score/vault hence ppl always know what to expect or maybe a cool addon idea
[6:46:35] kyodragon1573: well it sounds like we need a system that locks the goal in and if you leave before that goal is met then you get a penalty
[6:46:36] darthhelmett: in high keys we already vote, we all know its not going to be timed and we leave, this is only an issue in low keys. People think they're entitled to other peoples time, and your not
[6:46:39] Jetofficially: but ... you cant punish for leaving
[6:46:40] lxylt92: if that doesn't work, we can just whine more right
[6:46:46] germando1979: It would not be hard for them to code it so that it required you to pick finish or time when you listed a key
[6:46:51] sveikthewarlock: having a punishment system means youll just get more people just going afk until theyre kicked tbh
[6:47:02] popCatter: im 17 deaths pre boss in a 22 atal
[6:47:05] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[6:47:13] Lenietwitch: @Pallavos that's not my reality at ALL, so ye maybe is normal for you, i'm not staying if an ataldazar is going to last 1 hour xD
[6:47:29] Jetofficially: sideways
[6:47:30] soge131: It's easy guys, you can't punish people for leaving because YOU chose them to be in your key, in LoL the system makes them into your party, not your choice
[6:47:38] Jothor83: @popCatter only 17 , those are rookies numbers , you need to pump those numbers Kappa
[6:47:38] Cyberkaia_: @darthhelmett yeah, a lot of GGs on certain wipes, its not a vote, bout all have at least the same opinion of the key
[6:47:40] elschko: idk if it would be worth to implement a new lfr table bcs wow dead af and u just got 10ppl in every table like raid pvp and so on
[6:47:42] hulkadiggah: that happened to me too like 10 minutes ago
[6:47:43] Jetofficially: famous WASD boss
[6:48:11] Thalinan: lmao league is 1000x more frustrating than m+
[6:48:25] emnitthy: twice this week I started a key, the tank couldn’t hold aggro on the first pull, it was a wipe. is that a key worth continuing if the tank is unable to keep aggro 10 seconds in? I’m not wasting my time
[6:48:48] kouki33: no seems the same
[6:49:01] Thalinan: and with league, sometimes you need to stay in the game for the ENTIRE length of time even if someone is trolling. in m+, if someone is trolling, someone leaves, that's the end.
[6:49:12] Justflux: #1 tip, don't invite kazzak player
[6:49:19] Smiliereu: @emnitthy Depends, to you go full zugzug instantly on pulls?
[6:49:19] darthhelmett: @Cyberkaia_ ya the ggs is basically a vote right, we all know its not going to be timed, and we don't want to waste each others time. I understand people in lower keys have an issue with that, but i'm not wasting my time on a dead key IMO. And to be punished for leaving that would be just stupid
[6:49:22] smashhammer: you do that already
[6:49:28] Zapzoda: basically. just don’t pug. just get a good group of 4 other players to premade.
[6:49:48] Cyberkaia_: @darthhelmett agree
[6:49:50] Lenietwitch: lol i would never join a "weekly no leaver completition key" xD
[6:49:54] Ratherien: u can select what the key is for
[6:49:55] Jetofficially: ok. ... your cat downstairs, shreeks, you panic you leave the keya nd go find out what happened and you need to take your cat to the vet........ how do you punish for that ?
[6:49:56] theskot: there is that dropdown thing when you make the lobby
[6:50:32] Lenietwitch: adn what is the punishment ?
[6:50:32] darthhelmett: no leaver keys are different at the start of an expo
[6:50:41] darthhelmett: but not this far into the expo lol
[6:51:05] soge131: Something about 30%~~ of the timer would be my initial guess for over time
[6:51:08] JohnAllenCasts: it's also another moderation issue for bliz, of course any system will be exploitable and there will be mistakes and they'll need to deal with those issues
[6:51:11] dea78: U should be able to Leave After Time is up or there is a Vote to Depelete
[6:51:21] JohnAllenCasts: also what about people holding keys hostage or trolling streamer keys
[6:51:21] onegunpete: I have found most pugs to be agreeable, usually people talk and says the key is dead, anyone want to continue? etc. but I only do lower keys
[6:51:40] 5aigon: They willingly join tho..Nobody wants to write pages before starting keys. if u leave grps just bc u cant get score u waste the time of 4 other players. if u were allowed to relist ur grp (to complete it) - fine
[6:51:49] DONGAMAN: why are you always smiling can you show anger more often?
[6:51:54] Lenietwitch: "guys it's been 2 years, i missed my granmothers funeral, can i leave please :(" naguuraMonkaS

[6:52:36] Jetofficially: exactly. that,
[6:52:38] MBG_95: when we say Punish, its hardly like you are going to prison, thats just something you should accept as a result of the new system

[6:52:54] Smiliereu: medical emergency is not punnishable lmao
[6:53:06] Smiliereu: if its exploited you will get punnished
[6:53:20] green_candles: But who cares. Getting punished in a game isn't a big deal compared to dealing with an emergency
[6:53:21] Smiliereu: if its happends alot of times....
[6:53:21] onegunpete: but if the punishment is just 1hr where you can't join keys then it's np - as you're at the vets with your cat...
[6:53:23] kohfeeisdead: just have leaver warnings before punishments, so if someone makes it a habit to leave, they get punished. But allow people to have internet outages/emergencies.
[6:53:26] Smiliereu: you dont ned to prove it
[6:53:26] Thalinan: if it's an emergency, then a punishment of like a debuff that doesn't let you do m+ for x amount of time, prob wouldn't be a punishment because youd need that time to deal w the emergency anyway
[6:53:31] DONGAMAN: you need to submit real documents to remove the punishment
[6:53:35] sveikthewarlock: bro if you have an emergency, youre not gonna be thinking about the punishment system in a video game
[6:53:36] germando1979: wow geez this isnt a job lol
[6:53:39] skeletonetiquette: If it's an emergency then M+punishment should be the least of their concern xD
[6:53:41] soge131: If you're on the clear and you've not been punished before system will likely just give you a "Hey buddy don't do this" warning
[6:53:45] Cyberkaia_: @DONGAMAN not even in work LOL .. its just a gem
[6:53:53] Rayv123: If you have a real emergency, getting a punishment in a video game won't bother you that much tbh
[6:53:54] xVECTAx: what are you guys fighting about?
[6:53:59] krobus24: 90% of the time someone leaves its not an emergency ..can't make rules around exceptions
[6:54:01] kyodragon1573: I think this is getting taken way too extreme here
[6:54:03] Aalbedon: It's why some punishment systems look at how often a person leaves.
[6:54:11] Jothor83: how many often you ll have a real emergency while playing M+
[6:54:16] Jetofficially: you lose reputation and invite chance no ?
[6:54:18] itsClubby: my world ends there tbh
[6:54:19] Cyberkaia_: imagine sending domcuments to blizz to show that u have a real emergency LOL KEKW
[6:54:21] photonaxan: !drop
[6:54:22] Jothor83: how often*
[6:54:36] Nyx_87: peak First World problems
[6:54:39] FifiBelle_: @Cyberkaia_ Or asking the doctor for a print out, specifically to send to blizzard :D
[6:54:40] sveikthewarlock: @Cyberkaia_ i want my 15 io back blizz! >:(
[6:54:40] Jimmyy__: Just have an increasing punishment - if you leave once in 3 months, it's super low; if you leave 3x every day, it's higher, etc.
[6:54:40] tropicoxo: I guess make it similar to some shooter games like how they deal with frequent leavers in ranked games

[6:54:55] Jetofficially: there isnt one, you also cant punish players for changing their mind half way through the dungeon depending on how the run is going
[6:54:59] Jetofficially: you cant punish choice
[6:55:02] Lenietwitch: well same goes for theppl that ask for a punishment, is a video game, it is what it is, i feel everyone should be free to "stop" playing whenever they like without being punish
[6:55:12] kyodragon1573: everyone would just say it was an emergency...they would lie
[6:55:18] xVECTAx: i dont understand your kinks people
[6:55:22] ameloly: Let Blizzard Call you on Cell phone after you leave , and check on you so they know?
[6:55:22] Rayv123: you couldn't even outline what exactly would count as an emergency and what wouldn't lol
[6:55:33] Freajka: the real punishment is the lost time you put into it, that is enough
[6:55:35] Dogyy666: irl u can also get punish if something happen ;p
[6:55:36] Jothor83: put a punish that gets worse by as many times you leave so if it happens rarely the " punishment" whould not be much so if you get a real issue you can leave
[6:55:41] xVECTAx: bdsm got too far, you punish people in game now
[6:55:42] Fiestacado: about what kind of punishment do we speak?
[6:55:46] Jothor83: but you if you do it again and again you get burned
[6:55:58] flgiirl: agreed ppl would just say it's an emergency. Also what about if the game crashes or internet goes out.. annoying stuff happens
[6:55:58] Jetofficially: im glad my example makes people laugh
[6:56:01] Jetofficially: :)
[6:56:09] Nyx_87: you don't need to know it to have an effective system, just punish the outliers
[6:56:10] Jetofficially: good example no ?
[6:56:11] Jetofficially: hahaa
[6:56:16] Purrfektly: Let me facetime Jan quick so he know
[6:56:16] carmentisx: KEKW
[6:56:38] puntualus: john blizzard calling, what is your emergency?
[6:56:39] JohnAllenCasts: but they should be super passive agressive
[6:56:41] Smiliereu: Just saying it cant be proven it is a medical emergency because u dont actually ahve to prove anything.  and that will show that you are exploiting the "medical emergency" situation not that there isnt a real life situation, but its a question of how many times, is it once every day 2 times every day?  just use your brain about it
[6:56:43] sveikthewarlock: bro ill just text ion and let him know my cat was sick and he'll let me off the hook
[6:56:45] kyodragon1573: Hi Naguura we saw you left a dungeon group, is everything ok? lol
[6:56:45] KookieLaH: what's next you lose 3 arena's in a row and they call to check on your mental health

[6:57:07] Boogleboogle: my homies gonna drtess up as doctors to trick them
[6:57:13] xfrosteax: facetime you while you step into emergency room for operation
[6:57:16] Cyberkaia_: Doc, could u plz gave a copy of my exam, one for work, the other one its for blizz.
[6:57:22] soge131: It's not that you leave -> They delete your account guys. Depending on how often you do punishable things the system will act in one way or another, like in League you can get a warning, a permanent ban or anything in between
[6:57:32] WiseOldMandu: Losing rating for leaving active dungeons before the timer runs out would be a decent system. With scaling amounts per amount left in a day. Much log dodging queue in league.
[6:57:41] nornh: I think a system like csgo had was good, you get one hour timeout that doubles everytime you do it too frequently
[6:57:42] tropicoxo: yea then it resets if you don’t leave for say a month
[6:57:45] StockerFock: surrender vote like in league of legends when?
[6:57:47] JohnAllenCasts: key pushers crying rn
[6:57:47] theskot: first ones a freebie
[6:57:54] Smiliereu: nono, imagine some one saying it 10x times A day
[6:57:57] emnitthy: @wiseoldmandu absolutely deranged take
[6:57:57] kohfeeisdead: a forfeit vote for the key would be nice too.
[6:58:00] germando1979: that would the only way to do it
[6:58:01] xVECTAx: so you get punished if electricy goes off or you lose internet?
[6:58:01] ameloly: Make it , you cant leave untill like 5 Wipes ?
[6:58:08] sveikthewarlock: man just have it so that if you leave a key your character is deleted. ezpz
[6:58:09] maiiisan18: leavers debug for rating loss sounds like a good system
[6:58:14] maiiisan18: debuff*
[6:58:17] skeletonetiquette: It's just about goals and communication
[6:58:18] yenny__: punishment system is such a system rife for abuse PepeLaugh yeah let me just hold the key hostage or bully people into leaving first
[6:58:18] sveikthewarlock: go hard or go home
[6:58:27] Kjempebikkja: if you leave a key you should loose your house and car
[6:58:28] Jothor83: its better to have no freebies BUT the punishment is progressive the more times you leave the worse the punishment gets
[6:58:30] tropicoxo: or just make them lose io for leaving x amount of times in a row
[6:58:31] Aalbedon: now...what should the punishment be in a game like WoW?
[6:58:32] BeardedChazen: just start a key and then leave it assert dominance
[6:58:35] Jetofficially: they implement a tally showing how many times you leave keys, how about that ?
[6:58:37] syrexz: as someone with IBS i need to have an enema before committing to key pushing FeelsBadMan
[6:58:46] xVECTAx: @BeardedChazen brilliant
[6:58:47] Ratherien: what u want to avoid is the tanks leaving a key after the first wipe cause they can easily join another
[6:58:49] Wrighter16: It should just be progressive punishment that will decay overtime if you're being a good boy or girl
[6:58:50] Veesla: wait it means you could stuck someone in a key with you because you dont want to deplete ???
[6:58:51] nornh: @Aalbedon timeout for groupfinder
[6:58:53] soge131: Imagine people agreeing to leave the key: Hey buddy, anyone has their free dodge available? KEKW
[6:58:55] kohfeeisdead: but at least there is a deterrent vs what it is now. Harsher punishments for repeat offenders will slowly dwindle it
[6:58:55] TomCat: I never have done a key where everyone hasn't eventually left
[6:58:56] Yzma1: worst part is when they fuckup and leave right after
[6:59:05] xVECTAx: @Yzma1 i can feel that ptsd
[6:59:15] Dogyy666: u can leave one key/season :P
[6:59:15] germando1979: i would rather have someone leave than have a rat in the group

[6:59:26] yenny__: leaving punishment is such a fcking waste of time that will hurt the game more than help it, everyone that wants to leave hopeless keys will just afk or play suboptimally hoping for someone else to bite the bullet
[6:59:27] paseltv: are you german?
[6:59:28] StockerFock: i curious, how did this come up?  i dont even remember if i encountered ppl leaving still playable keys this season to be honest
[6:59:30] Shadostealer: @sorrowubw yes
[6:59:33] hogbruhh: nah I should not be kept prisoner in your crappy key that is clearly not getting timed lmao.
[6:59:41] flgiirl: you should have to do a "walk of shame" with the title "Deserter" for a day
[6:59:43] Shadostealer: i play on NA and play with oce players a lot
[6:59:50] sveikthewarlock: @Jetofficially same
[6:59:51] Smiliereu: never said you should get punnished
[6:59:54] emnitthy: imo there shouldn’t be any punishment period. people don’t just leave keys that go smoothly, they leave when they feel like they are carrying someone or the key is untimeable
[7:00:01] Cyberkaia_: @soge131 in legue high elo this happend a lot, someone asking to leave. ann ppl usually do, prefer lose 5pts and 5 min than 30 min and 15-20pts
[7:00:01] keewei: !drops
[7:00:02] StreamElements: Watch 4 hours to claim the grimfire camp toy! For more info -> https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24054789/updated-121-dragonflight-twitch-drop-get-the-grim-campfire-toy-23-january
[7:00:17] Smiliereu: was opening an example and YOU assumed i said people should get punnished for leaving
[7:00:17] tropicoxo: maybe have a voting system like everytime a key finishes or disbands, the game will ask you to rate each player based on like were they a team player etc and that shows up on their rating. rainbow six siege has something similar
[7:00:18] spontie: actually in dota real players with good rating are watching replays and decide if to panish or not the player who left (was reported). but we do not have replays inside the game unfortunatelly
[7:00:19] hogbruhh: if someone leaves your key then that is a skill issue on the groups part lol
[7:00:30] maiiisan18: if they afk or play suboptimallly, report them
[7:00:44] H8FaTe: what keys?
[7:00:46] soge131: @Cyberkaia_ . yeah, it used to be -3lp the first dodge within 24hs, and it was fucking hilarious LuL
[7:00:52] sveikthewarlock: @maiiisan18 how do you tell if someone is playing badly on purpose or if theyre just shit lol
[7:00:59] Fiestacado: maybe give the possibility to enable the punishment at the beginning of the key? so you accept it or you play in a group where it’s acceptable to leave.
[7:01:06] Lomesa_: Also now since you don't get score above 20 if you don't time there is not point in finishing
[7:01:07] maiiisan18: if blizzard’s reporting actually worked, that type of stuff would be punished
[7:01:11] Jetofficially: 28 crest farm, ive seen it
[7:01:16] maiiisan18: I’m with you there lol
[7:01:16] hogbruhh: @tropicoxo what if I feel like rating everyone 1 star no matter what?
[7:01:19] WiseOldMandu: I mean, i'm 3350 pushing like 50-100 keys a week and I still think that a small punishment for repeated leavers would be aight.
[7:01:24] Freddyfx36: clearly the issue needs to be looked at in reverse and increase the incentive to stay
[7:01:24] Veesla: i swear i do not want to get stuck for an hour or more, sometimes leaving is the only way because you re not passing it anyway
[7:01:30] WiseOldMandu: Make no mistake, I'd also get hit by this.
[7:01:35] Yzma1: Yeah that is understandable
[7:01:46] germando1979: i agree anything over a +20 is someone wanting to time for rating and upping their key
[7:01:49] Shadostealer: @Freddyfx36 no we do not need depleated score to matter
[7:01:59] Shadostealer: that was a dog system
[7:02:05] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[7:02:12] emnitthy: If the group wipes on the first pull I am absolutely not staying in that key. insta leave
[7:02:13] Jetofficially: their problem
[7:02:17] Freddyfx36: @Shadostealer then add rewards towards gearing
[7:02:20] Jetofficially: go have an orange juice
[7:02:25] sveikthewarlock: a bigger problem with m+ tho is that you get people paying for carries who join keys that are well above their ability and they just tank your key
[7:02:27] Veesla: the no-deplete under 20 seems good
[7:02:28] TomCat: what if 2 people want to go for score, 3 people want loot, and 1 person wants to repair a camera?
[7:02:28] StreamElements: Repair this wideASS
[7:02:34] skeletonetiquette: Align the goals

[7:02:46] Pecorette: ranked queue ?
[7:02:51] Lomesa_: Punishment for that will just bring more toxicity tbh
[7:02:54] kyodragon1573: what if they randomly put us together based off our input goal?
[7:02:54] Smiliereu: obivously higher keys is only for score, but i think people are generally talking about lower keys where people have LITTLE time to play this game, and people leave the lower keys for not making it in time half way trough
[7:03:12] lrome_xkak: staying in dead keys is worse for players with limited time than leaving
[7:03:18] theskot: i feel like if leaving was a real problem theyd have implemented something by now. seems rare to me
[7:03:24] soge131: @Shadostealer I agree, seemed like a bad decision at 1st but it actually made so much sense, now everyone at 21+ knows that it's either timed or leave
[7:03:38] kohfeeisdead: 5Head actual good implementation
[7:03:39] Veesla: i didnt even know it exist
[7:03:42] Ashnadur: there is such a simple solution for everyone fearing the keyleaving punishment -> only play high keys with a fixed group dnfLurk
[7:03:51] Smiliereu: its a difference playing a +2 ->  20 keys and 22-30 keys
[7:03:52] Cyberkaia_: agree
[7:03:53] hogbruhh: Leaving is only a big problem to reddit nerds anyway. No one actually cries about it more than them
[7:03:55] Fiestacado: so if one of the goals is selected then it’s ok to get punished if you leave?
[7:03:57] Wrighter16: Do they just make "rated" vs "unrated" keys where the goals are inherently different?
[7:04:04] emnitthy: people pugging their weekly vaults should just get some friends or guildies
[7:04:04] little_c2222: And make it so you can't leave
[7:04:23] little_c2222: I pick completion cuz I suck
[7:04:28] skeletonetiquette: Can you search in lfg for completion? Like will it pull up that tag?
[7:04:29] theskot: yeah weekly tag is good for that
[7:04:36] y0rge: didnt "weekly" is magnet for "gud" gamers ?
[7:04:37] Shadostealer: @Freddyfx36 we already gear very quickly. the rate of gearing now is like fine. above 20 i dont really want  more incentive from gear. if there was xmog or someshit could beok
[7:04:40] Mallilion: I think there's also people who want completion but they dont want to list it as such because they fear they'll get worse rated players sign up. So they gamble and then get upset
[7:04:41] Lenietwitch: because is trueeeeeeeeee xD
[7:04:51] CibyLv: Completion and Weekly for me sounds like 90minute prison KEKW
[7:05:09] soge131: @CibyLv Only 90? KEKW
[7:05:21] xdanielsooon: i just want to queue for m+
[7:05:22] fivaldrood: @Kuroz  BG3 when?  Cooking stream when?
[7:05:25] spontie: because the keyholder is not sure in himself at the first place assuming it might not be timed before the key has even been started. so there are reasons for that. so 'weekly' is bad to apply
[7:05:29] xdanielsooon: idk figure it out blizzard
[7:05:37] Kuroz: @fivaldrood all after drops, she didn't plan days
[7:05:46] Ren26: might be easier to just have players goals naturally align
[7:05:50] Shadostealer: also this seems like a 20-21 issue tbh
[7:05:55] Jetofficially: ive been thinking, two scores. 1 M+ score and a second No leavers score?
[7:05:58] Jetofficially: thoughts?
[7:06:00] popCatter: WeirdPaper
[7:06:08] CibyLv: You can see lot of keys listed as weekly on Tuesday evenings
[7:06:15] emnitthy: @poppapump at your old age ? embarrassing
[7:06:15] StreamElements: SHUT THE FUCK UP, I'M NOT OLD naguuraSassy
[7:06:17] StephixOne: Hallo
[7:06:23] s_0lst1ce: I didn't even know that was there, I would think most don't as it is optional
[7:06:29] riktor_5280: Are you french?
[7:06:32] cephac: i've also had a troll mage with high io join my 19 lust at the start of the dungeon and leave. so people cna just be toxic in general
[7:06:34] popCatter: popCat TeaTime
[7:06:41] Kuroz: @riktor_5280 Italian from south tyrol
[7:06:48] Lenietwitch: i feel th ecompletition mentality is a loser one, if you starting the key with the idea of depleting that's horrible, at the end of the day is a veto system, and i think is fine you can't hold hostage people because you want to complete
[7:06:55] StephixOne: @cephac What does their race have to do with it Kappa
[7:06:59] Moroleo7: Nothing will change ppls Mind doesnt matter what the choice is, ppl will llave if the want to even through penaltis.  Gamers are like sport fans everyone think ca do a better job as trainer and also gamers think can do a better game
[7:07:05] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[7:07:08] sveikthewarlock: @Lenietwitch hard agree
[7:07:08] Jetofficially: huh? but dont they choose who they invite?
[7:07:12] Smiliereu: your arguments is really weird talking from a high key perspective, have alot of friends playing lower keys who cant really handle the 20+ keys within timer, and often people just rage whine and leave the key
[7:07:19] TomCat: oh, sorry I didn't make it for pizza yesterday. I would have called but I was stuck in traffic in a tunnel and there was no reception
[7:07:43] i_Luccas: Caroooo ! wazzup :D moin moin
[7:07:46] emnitthy: @Smiliereu what does this even mean
[7:07:49] little_c2222: I set it to completion and people still freaking leave NotLikeThis
[7:08:10] Piktorr: The pug Life
[7:08:17] VanHoeAK: what addon are you using that shows the class colors in the finder?
[7:08:18] Smiliereu: @emnitthy that naguura is talking from a high key perspective about leavers, where every 1 wants score
[7:08:19] StephixOne: just play the game and vibe
[7:08:20] y0rge: or sing for some 1 else key
[7:08:23] Lenietwitch: @Smiliereu i mean if they can't handle a 20 why they playing it then ? that's the thing, do you see me playing in the nba ?
[7:08:28] Kuroz: !groups
[7:08:28] StreamElements: Group finder wa : https://wago.io/klC4qqHaF the weakaura isn't getting updated. https://wago.io/JhmeKOgMw (dragonflight version) or use premade group filter it does the same thing.
[7:09:14] y0rge: and evedry one knows the best keys are wit hthe tag "pumpers" :)
[7:09:15] LanPhr3ak: I left a +20 last night after I realized the pug group was a hidden carry.  After wipes on the second boss I found the hunter was ilvl 380.  I should not be forced to complete that should I?
[7:09:16] little_c2222: People haters
[7:09:16] Smiliereu: make a m+ dungeon finder, where u get a 30min timer for leaveing keys
[7:09:20] emnitthy: @Smiliereu if you want vault keys do 18s, get friends, if you have to get carried in 20s you probably should just... learn to play the game
[7:09:25] Lenietwitch: i feel they should remove the vault requirement for 20s , just make it 2 and increase the quantity once you go higher not the quality, so people wont feel force to run 20s when they can't handle them
[7:09:27] ecksdd: but people dont invite players under 489 and 4k score so they dont fail the key
[7:09:33] Smiliereu: thats what im saying
[7:09:36] Wrighter16: Just give players a behavior score
[7:09:37] Smiliereu: in high keys its a NONE issue
[7:09:45] timmah25: I feel like people have just hated having depleted keys on their IO page since Legion
[7:09:54] mrbridge89: stupid option imo
[7:10:00] little_c2222: My highest is 16 and pick completion and the jersey still leave
[7:10:02] StephixOne: I'm doing a 27 for fun, you're doing a 27 to beat the timer. We are not the same
[7:10:04] spontie: actually those weekly key were players try to do content higher they can afford are pretty good and peacefull atmosphere. very friendly. though those keys are verytime consuming
[7:10:11] little_c2222: Jerks*
[7:10:13] sveikthewarlock: if you have such a big issue with people leaving, just play with people from your guild
[7:10:15] soge131: No one in 21+ plays for anything other than score
[7:10:37] mrbridge89: i blame the players tbh
[7:10:39] Smiliereu: but u arent lmao
[7:10:40] little_c2222: Guildies won't take me either
[7:10:50] little_c2222: They too busy
[7:10:51] StephixOne: On alts I leave 16-18s that we *might* be able to complete as well if it's too frustrating, cba spending an hour for you to learn the dungeon or how to press defensives
[7:10:51] popCatter: lmao
[7:10:54] tropicoxo: behaviour score is a good option
[7:10:55] Smiliereu: u talking about the higher keys all the time :P
[7:10:57] popCatter: i love chat sometimes
[7:10:57] Jetofficially: i never sign up to completion keys, should only ever want to beat the timer
[7:11:00] sveikthewarlock: @little_c2222 join another guild then
[7:11:05] niobid: I feel like for lower keys, community sorted it out itself by having in-game communities for running keys that are often ment to be finished to completion.
[7:11:08] germando1979: I have a friend, who runs 25+ keys just to cause trouble lol,
[7:11:10] MineralPass: doing a key for timer => not doing a key for fun
[7:11:19] little_c2222: I am trying
[7:11:26] mzwttv: "im confused i only do high keys"
[7:11:28] Jetofficially: wait ... 20, 21 is high what are you saying ?
[7:11:35] ameloly: Well Again 20 is high for someone :D
[7:11:39] StephixOne: You're talking about high keys Naguura, 16+ Kappa

[7:12:08] Jetofficially: Nagura lolw key flex saying 20 and 21 is low keys
[7:12:08] little_c2222: Not alot of guilds raid and do mythics or have a lot of active players. It's like a diamond in the rough
[7:12:08] Kuroz: !talents

[7:12:13] hackiii: Jamgie
[7:12:15] Smiliereu: yeah you arguments and assumptions were funny have fun in mdi :)
[7:12:28] soge131: The tribunal or something like that

[7:12:42] sveikthewarlock: just remove the loot from dungeon if you go over time, problem solved. then no one will wanna stay in a dead key
[7:12:42] shiftyyi: @soge131 wish it came back
[7:12:46] StephixOne: @ecksdd exdee
[7:13:00] zster97: tribunal is so ideal but i feel like people used to abuse it
[7:13:01] emnitthy: if you cannot do a 15 youre literally just refusing to play the game correctly. You don't deserve to have full vault in myth if you are literally refusing to learn to play the game
[7:13:14] niobid: @Shadostealer Discovering these communities is not straightforward yeah. But there are ones for US and EU respectively and are fairly active. Like No Pressure for EU.
[7:13:16] ecksdd: @StephixOne oh you said 1750 because thats what you are LUL
[7:13:18] y0rge: ye img why would sing for that
[7:13:25] theskot: Tribunal could not handle the case load
[7:13:28] theskot: not even close sadly
[7:13:30] Onnill_: like in cs:go the overwatch vod reviews for cheaters
[7:13:31] MBG_95: that would be amazing
[7:13:31] StephixOne: @ecksdd or sarcasm went over your head, maybe
[7:13:35] StephixOne: just perhaps
[7:13:40] Vendrek: Alright Judge Naguura...
[7:13:48] lxylt92: drama stream content

[7:13:56] soge131: This player did not play their deffensives, 3 days ban KEKW
[7:13:57] Jetofficially: I'd tune in, until my name pops up for review xD
[7:14:01] little_c2222: @emnitthy teach me then
[7:14:02] Zapzoda: @naguura let me know. I’ll have plenty of footage from my keys
[7:14:03] MineralPass: Is that what guilds are for?
[7:14:15] sveikthewarlock: @soge131 too lenient
[7:14:17] Jetofficially: Nagura didnt bear ... banned
[7:14:20] StephixOne: After some of these Rise runs @Naguura would be permad
[7:14:22] emnitthy: @little_c2222 do your own work. I ain't paid to teach you how to play the game
[7:14:33] Shadostealer: @Shadostealer you dont even need those communites more aotc guilds i know do have a few people who come in bang like 15-18s for people and are chill to be around
[7:14:56] sveikthewarlock: @little_c2222 there are so many resources available to you to learn how to play better lmoa
[7:15:02] Jetofficially: nice flex yeah ... :D
[7:15:22] emnitthy: @sveikthewarlock yeah ikr, there's tons of websites, community discords, people willing to help
[7:15:24] niobid: @Shadostealer oh yeah, absolutely, it's just another place to be able to run them without risking toxicity.
[7:15:24] StephixOne: Realistically it's hardly a flex. If you care about progress/performance, 20s are the baseline
[7:15:26] MineralPass: Is that a player issue?
[7:15:30] Zapzoda: what’s the key you have to do for max vault ilvl?
[7:15:49] sveikthewarlock: remove loot from keys that deplete and no one will wanna stay for a dead key. problem solved
[7:15:54] ecksdd: @Zapzoda 20
[7:15:55] vharakh_17: @Zapzoda 20
[7:16:13] Lenietwitch: @sveikthewarlock yessssssss lol so true
[7:16:22] StephixOne: If you play casually and 15s are hard for you that's fine, but why do you even care then, just vibe and enjoy the game however you want
[7:16:23] emnitthy: Guys you dont have to do 20s for max vault, myth track starts at 18

[7:19:49] vharakh_17: @little_c2222 the point was that completion m+ content are for players with the same goal - which is to complete the dungeon - sure.... but people aren
[7:19:51] StephixOne: It hurts chat's feelings
[7:20:00] soge131: I was once gearing an alt (as a tank) so I ended up in this +10 uldaman where they simply did not have dmg or healing enough to take the last boss, so I left after 3 wipes, it was not close and it was not happening, I can see them being upset with me but I don't think I can be blamed for anything
[7:20:09] sveikthewarlock: @Shadostealer you heard me!
[7:20:30] ItsUrBuddyJake: Those individuals are part of the problem
[7:20:30] StephixOne: Naguura from her ivory tower, trying to help slootRiot

[7:20:37] little_c2222: Amen
[7:20:47] Jothor83: ppl dont like change but they want thigns to change
[7:20:48] onegunpete: They should change the option names: "Fun", "Sweaty" so that it removes the stigma of being seen as only bad players go for "Completion"
[7:20:51] Noxx_be: the struggles of us commoners
[7:20:59] watermel0n92: serwas
[7:21:08] Wrighter16: @soge131 Something like a group poll to forfeit the dungeon (if there was a system to punish leavers) to allow the group to disband by voting makes sense here, no?
[7:21:19] StephixOne: Here we go chat, "high keys" again
[7:21:37] Jetofficially: im all for it until i hit the negative side of it then i want it out

[7:22:39] Loite777: fake news
[7:22:41] Nitwise: I was lucky to be able to tank for friends that were doing very high keys. That enabled me to obtain high io without much failure rate. There are still attempts that some groups just falter early and its easier to regroup and try again. Key running is fast and furious at times. Sometimes not something you want to do on a weekend or evening while trying unwind.
[7:22:44] little_c2222: WutFace
[7:22:46] Jothor83: no dinner for a M+ mistake hmmm @Naguura damn thats commitment
[7:22:46] StephixOne: @Jetofficially Can you do the dungeon fine without? Then no
[7:22:48] sveikthewarlock: @Jetofficially they should be forced to delete their toon

[7:22:52] tropicoxo: you leave a key so Blizz calls and cancels your Uber eats order
[7:23:00] bayhie: I didn't know +20 was max gear for m+. @Naguura How long would it realistically take to start doing +20s if I start DF today?

[7:24:05] nemesis981: as a mid tier player
[7:24:05] soge131: Less than a week reset if you know how to play
[7:24:08] nemesis981: 1-2 weeks
[7:24:08] emnitthy: I mean if you have never played wow it would take a loong time
[7:24:10] Daruilol: 2 weeks max without premade
[7:24:10] leozank: If u have friends that helps u maybe just 1 hour
[7:24:13] Sly_404: 20 hrs if you get a naguura boost that is :)
[7:24:20] smashhammer: for the low price of 100 euros you can have your first +20 today kek
[7:24:27] Allonas: It took me 9 days to get from 312 - 382 now on my moonkin. And thanks to the Naguura UI my life became a lot easier.
[7:24:30] Xevenna: I feel like them learning the crafting system would even take a few hours by itself. lol Takes some people moths
[7:24:31] StephixOne: Depends if you can play the game, if you can play M+ already, etc
[7:24:39] Xevenna: and you need to be able to craft that gear
[7:24:41] TomCat: if things work out the way I'm planning this year, I'm going to be slipping into your DMs to get more of your insight about how group finder misses the mark
[7:24:41] georgepfitser: drugs

[7:24:56] ecksdd: lmao
[7:25:01] StephixOne: You can hit the gear for 20s in a couple of days honestly, but that doesn't account for being ABLE to do that content
[7:25:08] Shadostealer: nah fake news you can get hard carried in 20s. if you want to be why it wins or not maybe a bit longer but it depends on how much you care about improving

[7:25:33] Jetofficially: already happens im sure
[7:25:33] Onnill_: it really depends mostly on how much you play, if you sit for 14hrs a day you can get a character to full hc gear in a week
[7:25:35] chaarp: why do you hate that child?
[7:25:35] Sly_404: however asked the question initally, by now you can max out gear already at 18s you dont even have to do 20s
[7:25:37] emnitthy: child abuse?

[7:38:28] flutschbanane: Bremer knipp

[7:38:34] Guilleeee: italian and spanish cusine stand above the rest of europe, by quite a margin
[7:38:34] aelynn666: the carbonara with cream and sliced ham is going to make Italians mad
[7:38:36] Xandersmash: Hamburger?
[7:38:43] ZuboITO: croatian food is the best :)
[7:39:01] swaglordYOLOlol: @Xandersmash that's what I said. Germany has more claim to hamburgers than Italy does to pizza
[7:39:03] Sebleh: pepePhoned @kuroz
[7:39:03] itsClubby: The key to cooking good noodles is to slightly undercook them and serve; they'll finish off cooking in the hot broth
[7:39:03] pearl85: Bratkartoffeln
[7:39:13] kaitokidcat: i have felicetti pasta 2 try now
[7:39:26] Lennerrt: just microwave the pasta
[7:39:51] Xevenna: There is sauce that shouldnt just be bought in a jar  like alfredo sauce. That stuff isnt alfredo.
[7:39:58] kaitokidcat: surekrowd
[7:40:01] sim967: some people prefer to not clog their arteries with salt
[7:40:05] xfrosteax: krauts kommt nicht von ungefähr
[7:40:12] StephixOne: "Although "sauerkraut" is from a German word (Sauerkraut), the dish did not originate in Germany." :(
[7:40:15] Outheresomeplace: Jar alfredo whips ass.
[7:40:16] pottm: ja! brand frozen lasagna?
[7:40:21] swaglordYOLOlol: store bought Pesto is the grosses thing ever

[7:40:37] kohfeeisdead: It was popularized/made in america I think
[7:40:37] kaitokidcat: what!?
[7:40:39] Xevenna: its cream and parmesan. some salt maybe a little garlic thats it lol
[7:40:40] Xandersmash: @swaglordYOLOlol A quick google tells me Americans made burgers but the idea of shredded beef is German
[7:40:41] Lennerrt: but where does the alfredo come from then? LUL
[7:40:43] FishStixMajor: Its just a cream sauce
[7:40:46] Outheresomeplace: It's basically just cream and parmesan
[7:40:46] Nino_Power: VoHiYo
[7:40:46] quenvin: Cream reduced and then parmesan added to thicken it
[7:40:47] little_c2222: Cheese
[7:40:50] MBG_95: think its a very american creation
[7:40:51] quenvin: some add garlic
[7:40:53] Slayerdde: They probably kick you out if you try
[7:40:54] r3ax0n: crescione is my favourite italian food
[7:40:55] marcosvr: Its a carbonara without eggs, isnt
[7:41:08] t4pekid: Alfredo sounds so new york tho
[7:41:11] colgawow: Alfredo is basically like putting Ranch dressing on your pasta
[7:41:13] swaglordYOLOlol: @Xandersmash German immigrants from Hamburg invented the Hamburger, in America
[7:41:17] quenvin: Nope, been a chef for years, alfredo is heavy cream and parmesan
[7:41:25] zster97: america has our own version of italian/chinese/japanese food etc. and they always are both worse tasting and less healthy lmao
[7:41:26] kaitokidcat: is that cold pasta ?
[7:41:27] quenvin: And Caesar Salad is from Mexico, not Italy.
[7:41:33] Sinrath: Fettuccine Alfredo is italian
[7:41:34] Xevenna: @marcosvr real carbonara doesnt have cream in it actually. it uses the pasta  water
[7:41:35] StephixOne: @marcosvr Carbonara without eggs is .. pasta and guanciale and parmesan .. it doesn't have cream

[7:42:21] Xandersmash: @swaglordYOLOlol America is all migrates and always has been thats the idea of America though and if it was made by germen americans in america then its american?

[7:42:37] Kuroz: it was just butter and parmigiano originally
[7:42:38] Guilleeee: it's baseline, doesnt need a special name
[7:42:39] Guilleeee: LUL
[7:42:43] Fiestacado: Der Döner Kebap, wie wir ihn heute kennen, wurde in Berlin in den 1960er bis 1970er Jahren von türkischen Einwanderern erfunden. Diese Form des Döners, serviert als Sandwich mit Fleisch, Salat und Soße in einem Fladenbrot, ist eine Anpassung der traditionellen türkischen Küche an die Geschmäcker und Bedürfnisse in Deutschland. Die genaue Herkunft und der Erfinder des Döner Kebaps in dieser speziellen Form sind jedoch umstritten, wobei mehrere Personen die Erfindung für sich beanspruchen.
[7:42:45] Fiestacado: Der Grundgedanke des Drehspießes, an dem Fleisch gegrillt und dann in Scheiben abgeschnitten wird, stammt ursprünglich aus dem Nahen Osten.
[7:42:50] marcosvr: @StephixOne I know that carbonarra doesnt go cream, its eggs and cheese, but what I'm saying its that they substitute the eggs for butter
[7:42:54] Fiestacado: Nur um das nochmal abzuschließen ;)
[7:42:55] kaitokidcat: good pasta is an art .... like pizza
[7:43:02] sim967: says it was invented in Rome in 1914 by Alfredo
[7:43:03] mix_taped: even better
[7:43:06] zster97: when i worked at an authentic italian restaurant in the states we 100% did not serve alfredo
[7:43:08] StephixOne: @marcosvr Alfredo has cream as far as I know though, if that's what we're talking about
[7:43:11] Raogrimm: MURICA
[7:43:22] sim967: I think white wine as well
[7:43:23] swaglordYOLOlol: @Xandersmash Then pizza is American
[7:43:33] Xandersmash: yes
[7:43:38] zster97: we did serve carbonara and it was fireeee
[7:43:40] marcosvr: @StephixOne I only ate alfredo with butter instead of cream
[7:43:42] Xandersmash: and sandwiches are Itallian
[7:43:43] kaitokidcat: CarbooneraxD
[7:43:46] ninjaradioactive: The plate exist in Italy "Fettuccine Alfredo" in Rome whit butter and parmigiano yummy
[7:43:53] Kuroz: gricia would be that
[7:43:57] StephixOne: It's like pizza except noodles instead of bread and cream instead of tomato sauce
[7:43:58] quenvin: Carbonarra is Bacon/Prosciutto, eggs and Parmesan
[7:44:00] pottm: bolognese is chili without beans
[7:44:00] quenvin: No cream
[7:44:02] Kuroz: but I give up
[7:44:18] StephixOne: @marcosvr I get you, I've had little Alfredo to be honest, thought it was cream-based at least in the US
[7:44:20] Legenda_RP: Gino D'Acampo is having a heart attack somewhere

[7:44:31] zster97: bolognese is just like carbonara! just with totally different ingredients and pork instead of beef right
[7:44:32] Steelhammer96: carbonara is not bacon, its guanciale
[7:44:42] kaitokidcat: speck xD
[7:44:43] ninjaradioactive: Guanciale is right

[7:45:09] xfrosteax: if my grandma heave wheels she would be a bicycle
[7:45:18] Kuroz: the no egg version is gricia, it exists, nothing to do with alfredo
[7:45:18] zster97: the only thing i didnt like about eating in italy was the pie not being pre sliced for me lmao
[7:45:23] zster97: the pizza pie
[7:45:32] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[7:45:32] marcosvr: @Naguura if you want to scream, google for any brazilian pizza, we have pizza with strogonoff here
[7:45:34] MBG_95: there is also no problem changing a recipe, but just dont call it the original name
[7:45:39] Fiestacado: I read some time ago, that carbonara was invented by us soldiers during ww1 when the where in italy. they combined their breakfast (eggs, ham) with local spaghetties.
