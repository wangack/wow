[1:01:32] LSBreed: asmon lul.
[1:01:35] CritcobainTV: People are so angry KEKW alliance is so upset because now more people will play horde because queues are better. they REALLY thought people would reroll alliance for better queues
[1:01:36] manmower: people would rather others have less than everyone have more
[1:01:38] I_DoctorSatan_I: I havent even done any Callings since 9.1 Valor is pretty useless right now unless ur scrambling to upgrade stuff b4 Tuesday.
[1:01:41] CritcobainTV: that shit aint gonna happen
[1:01:51] GTocha20: according to them no one will play alli anymore because no downsides to horde anymore
[1:02:03] smashwow: @smashwow not in a long long time. but all my toon names start with smash. mainly playing healers these days. hpally life for now
[1:02:08] all_beef_franks: But people are worried they won’t have the insta queues anymore with the same faction horde queues

[1:03:15] Kinghorn: all those alliance crying about the change were not even queueing
[1:03:19] Kinghorn: so fuck em
[1:03:23] zSKIz1: I made alliance because I wanted fast pvp. I don’t want my short time to play daily to be in a queue for 35 minutes
[1:03:36] zSKIz1: I would have made horde this was a thing
[1:03:52] CritcobainTV: 35 minutes? @GryzSki KEKW try 1.5 hours
[1:04:02] swervity82: or just leave it as it is.... if you want to pvp the hour wait queue is what you deal with
[1:04:16] Kinghorn: alliance spotted swervity82
[1:04:19] CritcobainTV: @swervity82 average players dont have 1-2 hours to wait on queues to play a game my man
[1:04:25] Ponickz: nah they have the npc to switch for bgs in retail and that idea was brought up and they said hell no
[1:04:29] Zeijun: will faction imbalance get worse?

[1:04:48] rhodeos_: the hour wait was fine 14 years ago, no one has time to wait in that shit now a days
[1:05:00] I_DoctorSatan_I: I'd rather wait for 1hr for PvP queue than currently grps waiting for the Fallen Charger for 9hr 35 min yesterday
[1:05:00] zSKIz1: I’m not mad they did this. I’m mad they didn’t add dual spec and are testing this

[1:08:01] GiraffeHydra_: if there is an issue, its for the alliance players who would've went horde but for the pvp queues, and i'm guessing that's a bigger population than I'd expect
[1:08:06] racketpunch: Are you only raid logging in TBC Towelliee?
[1:08:13] Sollice: @raldrik I dont know if I agree with that. I think if we were all one pool of players you would see more people going back to alliance because then it wouldnt matter

[1:09:04] CritcobainTV: @Triknives You're ating like people that are already q'ing bg's at 70 are going to now relevel 1-70 just because horde bg queues aren't as bad. There's literally no chance
[1:09:39] Triknives: @Critcobain No. I am saying, World Map presence is messed up. I don't care about Arena.

[1:11:42] LSBreed: @towelliee congrats to lulaboo on being a caster for comexity limit stream! that's gonna be awesome.
[1:11:45] CritcobainTV: Rarely anything in the world even matters. There's literally just world bosses to make much of a difference and alliance have been shitting on horde in those aspects anyone even on horde populated realms @Triknives
[1:11:46] veubenta: When did faction change come out?>
[1:11:55] veubenta: im guessing it started then
[1:11:56] CritcobainTV: @veubent wrath
[1:12:01] Triknives: "Just world bosses, Just shards, Just Summoning stones"
[1:12:07] Triknives: Yea, just a few things.
[1:12:17] Mallaes: Gloria! coxChicken coxManleee
[1:12:18] Kinghorn: what? on azuresong horde has had like every world boss kill
[1:12:23] Triknives: People have a hard time turning in their Kara Attune quest to even go in.
[1:12:41] Triknives: Because 40 Horde just sit there. And tons at summoning stones.

[1:12:59] CritcobainTV: @Triknives the reason people sit and camp world areas is because it's more honor per hour than trying to BG
[1:13:11] Triknives: Yea and that problem came from...
[1:13:21] furansowah: @Cerealkillas and horde deserved to wait longer in queue LUL
[1:13:25] Triknives: There being too many horde lol
[1:13:25] Solarsailors: ive noticed that today too
[1:13:26] CritcobainTV: and now that's going to go away since bg queues will be faster? I don't understand the point lol
[1:13:43] Triknives: That the community made the problem
[1:13:48] Armdel: did you see about people getting 210 gear in maw of souls
[1:13:50] gravlaxxx: restart

[1:13:50] Stonefather: Rolling restarts
[1:13:52] pavepawns: maybe a hotfix?
[1:13:53] veubenta: Anyone have advice for finding a semi serious raiding guild these days?
[1:13:53] Echo_Crusader: rolling restarts
[1:13:57] Triknives: That is the issue. And now its just well, the majority wins . Cool.
[1:13:59] Moronil: I just came back to the game and server shutdown D:
[1:14:04] Kisswani: I'm glad i have a ton of catchup to do . this week gets me time to do stuff
[1:14:04] RaginCajun05: yea maybe fixing the rares
[1:14:07] Triknives: Yea its a quick restart I think.
[1:14:19] Armdel: maybe we are finally getting the free covenant swap
[1:14:20] Molvonos: I'm already bored of 9.1. Especially with the bugged rares and the stupid 'cant loot in combat' bullshit.
[1:14:24] I_DoctorSatan_I: Just go look up what servers are Horde and Alliance heavy. If you don't like one faction having the majority of presence over the other, then GTFO and go to a different server where the Alliance/Horde favors YOUR faction. Simple.
[1:14:29] T0MMYT: LUL
[1:14:38] Smokebear: people still play Alliance?
[1:14:41] CritcobainTV: @Molvonos shut up Molv
[1:14:42] CritcobainTV: <3
[1:14:46] Molvonos: Nuh!
[1:14:53] Triknives: They just had to put faction locks on Pop.
[1:15:00] GiraffeHydra_: @I_DoctorSatan_I yeah but then what will I complain about? I don't want to have to think of a new thing
[1:15:08] aeyt: ashen go brr
[1:15:10] veubenta: @Smokebear I would actually prefer it, but don't because all my friends play horde.
[1:15:19] Triknives: @I_DoctorSatan_I How about you just re-roll then as Alliance? Get your queues?
[1:15:24] Smokebear: @veubent literally feels impossible to find a decent pug these days on alliance
[1:15:27] veubenta: Probably stems from being Allience in vanilla wow
[1:15:31] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i want to swap to venth again for my rogue bro but im TERRIFIED that since i already did my weekly shit i'll be 2 renown behind people
[1:15:43] Kasern: Angels or vampires? My paladin is sticking with the angels
[1:15:46] Molvonos: Just go find mawshrooms to loot Crit.
[1:15:52] Molvonos: Renown from the skies
[1:15:53] RocketMan23: for somebody who focuses on M+ i could never swap off kyrian for prot paladin
[1:15:56] veubenta: @Smokebear yep, IMO game is forcing itself into a cross faction que system
[1:15:58] Zettabyte: Heard that Sloot was retiring from WoW @Towelliee Kappa
[1:15:59] CritcobainTV: @Molvonos actually?
[1:16:09] jarilrpg: he will go for what he will be playing for sylv on early bosses for the gear
[1:16:10] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Triknives I'm already Alliance for 12 years. I think im good.
[1:16:10] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:16:15] Molvonos: Nah, but they made the catchup mechanics amped, supposedly.
[1:16:24] Zettabyte: LUL
[1:16:31] Smokebear: @veubent they should have merged factions after MoP
[1:16:35] CritcobainTV: I have like 34 renown with venthyr already, but im saying i'll be stuck at 40 this week because i already did the 2 weeklys to get to 42 @Molvonos so i'll just be perma behind
[1:16:47] Blistz1: What happen to the Raid shadowlands promo?
[1:17:02] Molvonos: You can run some M0's or some such for catchup. Or, gods willing, LFR
[1:17:03] Sollice: May be over?

[1:17:12] jarilrpg: @Critcobain it should let you catch up for the current cap, if not this week then next
[1:17:28] CritcobainTV: If u guys are wrong im gonna be big Sad
[1:17:31] veubenta: @Smokebear That would have for sure been the time, and then people could just play what they wanted, instead of having to worry about not being picked up because some elitiest who still does less damage then you has the "ideal race."
[1:17:41] Molvonos: I still need to run Torg into the ground for my other 3 replacement legendaries.

[1:19:21] I_DoctorSatan_I: that one piece
[1:19:22] Robodope: these bugs are so weird how do they happen. a random legion dungeon
[1:19:32] CritcobainTV: doing that shit real quick on my priest EZ Clap
[1:19:42] I_DoctorSatan_I: its been hot fixed already
[1:19:44] Alaquane: that's funny

[1:19:51] Mackadeus: Who finds this shit LOL
[1:19:51] MrGattz: is this a thing we do
[1:19:51] Sollice: Legion timewalking soon
[1:19:55] motorboatingpro: It probably shares a name with something current.
[1:19:57] Robodope: did someone search and replace a bunch of items with shadowland-sounding names and fucked up
[1:20:00] Molvonos: Multidollar company.
[1:20:13] I_DoctorSatan_I: this right here is a big oof though...lots of rewards lost for skip
[1:20:23] xrandomdoodx: I kinda wish they'd bring old dungeons back into the M+ rotation to keep things fresh
[1:20:31] egraves7: still worth the skip for me
[1:20:42] tacofury2: you also miss the crate with catch up gear
[1:20:46] Robodope: they also screwed up the covenant skip quest in exactly the same way at launch. it didn't give souls
[1:20:48] Sollice: Maw intro ski[ would be a big win lol
[1:20:49] Stonefather: I wonder if this restarts fixes the new store mount not showing up in your mount page danKEK

[1:21:59] storm99413: DH power
[1:22:01] motorboatingpro: @xrandomdoodx I think the "completion mode" for torgast is opening the door to that and probably a new M+ system.

[1:22:10] IianaDRK: @Towelliee you could goblin glider across

[1:23:29] Ambersulfr: I think it should be implied, and there is some warning. If you don't do a quest obviously you're not going to get the rewards for the quest.
[1:23:40] Mackadeus: Doesn't it already have a confirmation like "Are you sure you wish to skip these quests?" when you click the option?
[1:23:52] manmower: warning: if you don't kill this raid boss he won't drop you loot
[1:24:09] kokochris: yea
[1:24:09] CritcobainTV: The conduit one is pointless until you're maxed out later on

[1:24:36] CritcobainTV: Bears get fucked KEKW

[1:24:59] kokochris: @Acarnis I had the same bug; I was like WTF
[1:25:00] thiccsushi: it should be targeted 100% as druids it sucks so bad
[1:25:01] Lazugo: The conduit item sucks hard
[1:25:10] xsp00n: they should have left the stygia upgrade to 226 one in
[1:25:15] pavepawns: rank 4 is decent too for the 230
[1:25:20] manmower: it should upgrade a conduit straight to 252
[1:25:22] Tigerklaue: cause of domination sockets there arent much left

[1:29:38] JayGodd: Crazy, i literallly just downloaded SWTOR last night and just started playing lol
[1:29:44] Naturalbeef: This was the one MMO that had the story/lore to compete with WoW
[1:29:57] Stonefather: God, imagine if this game would've released in this decade danSad
[1:30:08] manmower: buy upgraded harddrives for the servers
[1:30:10] haunt_r: if SWTOR had more content on launch it would be one of the top 5 MMOs
[1:30:10] fearlessfungi: EA has said SWTOR is making them some serious cash
[1:30:25] zUpInSmoke: vengeance dh still good in 9.1 boss?
[1:30:28] ArcaneMaki: Yeah I used to play. I was wondering if they were still doing great. Great to hear they still do.
[1:30:44] fearlessfungi: Revan, yeah
[1:30:54] CrowCommando: HydrationEnthusiast subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Yup
[1:31:07] Voodoochild77: Yeah, they had the same dungeon for like 2 years. LOL

[1:31:27] kokochris: I WISH
[1:31:32] kokochris: I would so love that
[1:31:33] CritcobainTV: That would be sick
[1:31:39] kokochris: hell yes
[1:31:41] Kinghorn: that is the dream
[1:31:45] Ambersulfr: I understand that would be a pain, but that would be kind of amazing.
[1:31:47] jarilrpg: make them all LFR/normal ilvl that would be great
[1:31:47] kojialfa: nice idea tbh
[1:31:48] kokochris: if they can pull it off
[1:31:51] manmower: do that for the dungeons as well, m+ BRD
[1:31:51] sticksaredrifting: servers down for maintenance
[1:31:53] haunt_r: they cant handle timewalking, im not gonna hope on them to make it a core feature lmao
[1:31:55] Mecabeast: thatd be hard to balance
[1:31:56] Stonefather: Imagine all the broken trinkets and set bonuses danKEK
[1:31:57] Ambersulfr: I don't think anyone would ever do the old content tbh
[1:31:59] IchabodCrain: a lot of the gear of those older raids would be broken af
[1:32:04] madvillain_1: STAR WARS OMEGALUL
[1:32:10] Anoxia: new gw2 xpac coming as well
[1:32:16] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i think if they scaled all of those old raids you'd probably just never leave Uldir right? LUL
[1:32:18] Lazugo: Imagine 500+ items to get every possible combination of gear
[1:32:23] CincinnatiWiLL: Log in bugged or servers still down for rolling restarts?
[1:32:33] kokochris: I always wanted the older zones to be redone visually. to the quality of the newer expansion zones
[1:32:41] Velashen: They said GW2 expansion but they haven't given much info. I'm not holding my breath. @Anoxia
[1:32:43] kokochris: but time.. money... u know
[1:32:44] v3ritas151: star wars is good game low key. the story in that game so well done
[1:32:50] CritcobainTV: it's been 2 minutes KEKW
[1:32:51] Kinghorn: at his point, I kinda want the revamp more than an expansion lol
[1:32:58] Anoxia: @Velashen they got the more info coming this month in some presentation
[1:33:01] Stonefather: I mean they already do Timewalking raids, so they could just use the intern to do it.
[1:33:03] DreavT2K: if time keeps flying lich king classic wil be right around the corner
[1:33:09] Velashen: @Anoxia Good!
[1:33:09] IchabodCrain: it does say that they'll take up to an hour to restart
[1:33:10] DragonofWolves: So i currently got like 10 renown to grind... i never realized that before i started with TBC towCry
[1:33:12] CritcobainTV: nah BC down for bgs probably and retail for the hotfixes or something
[1:33:14] toocheap2rhyme: RIP servers
[1:33:14] Ambersulfr: Guess someone needs to go "hit the button" in the server room for Illidan LUL
[1:33:15] crawcook: Yeah, I would never wish for them to work on old content instead of making better new expansions
[1:33:16] Robodope: feels bad man
[1:33:19] Recaud: i think earning currency for buying catch up gear by playing legacy raids and dungeons would be nice
[1:33:20] Moronil: what about bless online Kappa
[1:33:23] Cristoff90: Swtor on console would be huge IMO. Surprised it hasn’t happened yet.
[1:33:24] Xailen: Them ancient servers need more restarts!

[1:34:35] dracullus: @Towelliee on EU it's exactly halfway through week, 12 hours after reset on 4th day
[1:34:35] Ambersulfr: I want a bard-equivalent
[1:34:43] Machine42593: Cinders

[1:35:23] crawcook: @drakenPWN only if you like doing raids, mythic+ or pvp
[1:35:25] RageerPLZ: 1st time clickbait waited 3 weeks for shipment
[1:35:34] Deadelus0: They would never announce a bug to be fixed at the next restart as that would cause people to targeted farm them :-)
[1:35:38] happybooger: pushed*
[1:35:38] LucidAntics: yeah cave boy was stuck in the ceiling yesterday.

[1:35:44] Bl4ckSauce: sks bouli
[1:35:46] Ponickz: he was bugged on the PTR
[1:35:50] Stonefather: Kroke was up every 15 minutes, and yesterday not once, I bet Blizzard tried to increase his respawn timer and added too many 0s
[1:35:55] NVbrutal: first day rares were fine its after they fixed the scaling of hp that it started to get bugged out
[1:35:56] sticksaredrifting: gathering quests in the rift is cool. you get 500 research per

[1:39:22] aeyt: KEKW
[1:39:30] Alaquane: I like it being small
[1:39:33] I_DoctorSatan_I: running around chasing phasing and 5 sec disappearing mushroom spawns when 2 ppl loot it for hours like a chickens head cut off...F U N!! 4Head

[1:39:45] S1appadabass: @Towelliee i hate the way the treasures work out there, its garbage
[1:39:48] furansowah: the fucing 30FPS rare spawn KEKW
[1:39:57] Lexi__Marie: it gave me things to collect i dont see a point in being upset
[1:39:59] Kinghorn: remember how ass the nazjatar WQs were at the start
[1:40:03] bruhSit_farmer: yea who cares about the world in world of warcraft :P

[1:40:07] sinlesssinner: yo what was ur mythic+ rating according to blizzard system? @Towelliee
[1:40:14] I_DoctorSatan_I: Can't loot chests / mushrooms while "in combat" then have the nodes disappear when some shitter loots it...F U N 4Head
[1:40:17] aeyt: Like, why cant it just be WQs? why does it have to be rares that have 10 year respawn timers
[1:40:18] LucidAntics: @Alexis___QT You gotta remember, people are NEVER satisfied with anything.
[1:40:26] toocheap2rhyme: is korthia like required content?
[1:40:26] jarilrpg: @Towelliee i think they should have just added the megadungo with the launch of the patch, maybe lock off hardmodes for the first week, would have given more to do this week
[1:40:31] manmower: it's a daily quest spot for raiders to waste a little time each day, it doesn't seem like it is designed to be endless casual content, those are dungeons and torghast
[1:40:38] Dishonor_II: Dishonor_II subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 11 months already
[1:40:41] toocheap2rhyme: BibleThump
[1:40:46] papaherc: as long as raids and dungeons are good, the vast majority of players dont care about the overall games health
[1:40:51] dbeezie14: i dont think its about item level. pugs online still cant do heroic sire
[1:41:01] toocheap2rhyme: TERRIBLE
[1:41:05] manmower: we want a new Shadowlands BG with Anima Powers in it
[1:41:09] bruhSit_farmer: wasnt it implemented for casuals
[1:41:16] dracullus: @Alexis___QT it's WoW playerbase, first you are upset and then you pick current weakest content and make mountain of complains about it
[1:41:21] DragonofWolves: If I'm being honest, I think everyone could care less about the raid. I think everyone is looking forward to those Anduin and Sylvanas cinematics, least thats what im looking forward to
[1:41:27] woke_athlete: they are up
[1:41:28] AmZambie: Classic is back up
[1:41:35] stallowned: LUL
[1:41:41] jkitchin75: @hjo1992 and there the ones that keep this game going
[1:41:43] cruzeal: fax LUL
[1:41:44] IianaDRK: its launcher sucks lol
[1:41:47] Rictamar: it was implemented as a casual zone for people to slowly upgrade their Korthia gear for those who don't raid, M+ or PVP
[1:41:49] KonceptionZ: its up
[1:41:51] DragonofWolves: YUP
[1:41:51] KonceptionZ: servers up
[1:41:54] othraerir: have you ever updated Lotro? takes forever
[1:42:07] sakura_2020: that bit raider for swtor was so terrible i deleted that shit
[1:42:08] Raanoren: I run it off steam with hardly any wait.
[1:42:09] mavericks312: @dragonofwolves nah the raids area always top notch WoW's raids are light years beyond anyone elses
[1:42:09] Marston_23: yeah the old republic launcher is so bad
[1:42:10] Lexi__Marie: yeah like i dont do end game content so if i can run around and collect things in a bug zone its still collection and im ok with it
[1:42:12] Raedari: That's how the GW2 launcher was for me
[1:42:24] Deadelus0: As a programmer: making a progressbar is f*ing hard :-P
[1:42:24] Colt_Engineer: I just got home from work and we have another reset?
[1:42:26] bruhSit_farmer: @jkitchin75 for sure I like variety in wow, and I like the world actually meaning something to progress in ect. Shadowlands hasn't quite hit that unfortunately
[1:42:26] manmower: the launcher compiles all the code
[1:42:30] pukuhukutukulukumukutuku: i wish Only the UI was the issue with ANY or their resets/updates/patches/xpacs been here since day 1 and Never seen 1 clean resets/updates/patches/xpacs
[1:42:36] OneCoolNewt: tbc up
[1:42:36] jemjarz: @SpaceCannivore GW2 launcher is fine until it decides to "repair files"
[1:42:39] aeyt: WHY DID THEY MAKE CHESTS DISSAPEAR LIKE INSTANTLYY. pain pain pain i hit mobs while some1 else just walks up and clicks it
[1:42:42] KonceptionZ: tbc
[1:42:44] vimie: Classic is up
[1:42:44] Stonefather: He was
[1:42:45] dbeezie14: how you still getting trolled by these nerds
[1:42:47] MrGattz: he was
[1:42:48] veubenta: @mavericks312 yep, thats the one thing they do right
[1:42:49] DubzDoes: @Towelliee Did you do the skip for your Alts? Or did you redo the NF scenario?
[1:42:55] Oldduketree007: NA down?
[1:43:00] Solarsailors: yeh he was
[1:43:15] jkitchin75: @hjo1992 very true its a big fail for me
[1:43:17] Robodope: yeah I don't really get why chests disappear so fast. you have a daily cap on those anyway. just makes me hate other players.
[1:43:18] Raedari: @jemjarz I never played Star Wars so I have nothing to compare it to other than the Blizz launcher, so maybe that's why I thought it took ages lol
[1:43:35] DragonofWolves: I have never liked the SWTOR launcher... THANKS EA
[1:43:40] jemjarz: @SpaceCannivore Honestly GW2 launcher takes its sweet time at times, but you know whats the worst? Steam LOL

[3:30:34] loktar_ogars: he likes cool shit he's not a nerd

[3:30:58] crowe6485: the msq from when u hit lvl 50 to heavensward is painful
[3:31:05] NotEnoughMana: theyre probably switching chars?
[3:31:10] loktar_ogars: so its like a solo game?
[3:31:11] NotEnoughMana: nvm
[3:31:13] Alienfromger: the story itself is hard to follow with all the things going on

[3:31:30] MindKrush: May be a dumb question but. After I started 9.1 the maps for both the MAW and Korthia are just blanked out like it is when you first go to an area. Is there something I can do to get my maps to reveal like they should?
[3:31:39] veubenta: i got sick of msq to 50 so i just zipped through it and youtibes a good review
[3:31:52] Austei: in between 1 dungon run every 6 houts story lol

[3:33:35] bruhSit_farmer: toxic

[3:36:53] zgag: I think Blizzard dropped the ball some with Kortiha. After nearly 9 month wait for 9.1 Korthia should have been pretty damn good
[3:36:57] xXSiebzehnXx: Lotto winner went in and hit the goals
[3:37:01] Horseweave: Asmongold v Aurum Vale
[3:37:12] Sollice: @Bjinc No i thought they were making a specific FF14 maybe cgi series for Netflix

[3:43:39] McFreeBreeze: contents the same but 5 months extra wait is rouuugh

[3:43:58] CritcobainTV: yeah, this patch made me go to pornhub more for sure
[3:44:00] D3m0nHunt3r666: Even the Broken Isles was better pandatvDerp
[3:44:00] Tirfing_: @Towelliee feels like the problem is this is when the .2 release would be coming out
[3:44:02] CritcobainTV: too bored in korthia
[3:44:06] Austei: 22 mo extra was rough
[3:44:08] bruhSit_farmer: 10 months extra
[3:44:14] Bayne77: ive been waiting for this patch since 2015
[3:44:19] Tequilawyrm: This whole ordeal has shown just how smooth brained and childish so much of the wow community is
[3:44:20] ThaOriginalGamester: I waited 2 years for the garbage Kappa
[3:44:23] Buckwink: the people bitching the most dont even play the game regularly lol
[3:44:25] Xindii: 5 + 2 = more content Kappa
[3:44:34] swoopdawooshh: Lmao
[3:44:36] rsimpson105: six thousand years was such a long wait for this patch
[3:44:41] akbartheiv: 9.1 actually has more than 8.1, it’s just a recency bias
[3:44:51] Austei: i tried even doing it late at night was still bs
[3:45:01] Poriand: wtf im almost tier 3
[3:45:04] Bayne77: 220 cap right?

[3:45:45] GamerKillance: Okay why tf is FF14 so popular today lol
[3:45:52] SirYacob: Korthia is pretty fine. It's just spawn rates are garbage.
[3:45:59] Atem___: Hammers UP! Good afternoon Toweliee! towHAMUP
[3:46:04] BananJocke: People just like to rag on stuff for the whining it self. Most people dont even play the game. And we have been in a world with a pandemic cousing everything to take alot longer to do.
[3:46:08] FergusCreative: legion kara was .1 patch
[3:46:12] bruhSit_farmer: Korthia for the wait is a bitttt, lacking ?!?
[3:46:16] FergusCreative: actually no I think it was a .5
[3:46:17] zgag: If 9.1 was released like the previous .1 's I think more players would've been less likely to question the progress of the .1 compared to past .1
[3:46:23] TheUnknowing: yeah kara was 7.1
[3:46:41] GamerKillance: Maw might be considered new since statistics show people never really did content in it lol
[3:46:42] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee theres 4 treasure chest in the area that gives 500 per
[3:47:08] Keyastaron_: ahh damn
[3:48:22] Sephirothxz: The point is that 9.1 is way better than bfa and legion .1 patches but we had like 7.1 after 2 montha after legion release and 8.1 after 4 months after bfa release. Now we are in 9.1 after 8 months from shadowlands release so people are really angry
[3:48:43] McFreeBreeze: Genuinly confused isnt it literally 9 months since launch from October compared to 8- 8.1 which was 5 months

[3:51:02] shimwood: You're in a raid group so it wouldn't have mattered
[3:51:05] Sephirothxz: I think they better be in a good point with 9.2 patch otherwise tbc will literally take over retail cause most of the people doesnt even raid and 9.1 offers low content.

[3:52:56] McFreeBreeze: Would you rather have genuinly hard mythic dungeons with optional bosses that are genuinly tougher but give better loot or keep the M+ timer style of dungeons.
[3:53:09] diivil92: all i need for bc is the heroics and nightbane for attuments
[3:53:42] Murlocz: Have they talked anything about flying in Shadowlands? The requirements
[3:53:44] pavepawns: i like hardmode alot

[4:15:01] CritcobainTV: @91Niki hi
[4:15:24] 91Niki: Just got back from watching A Quiet Place 2, that movie is amazing!!! :D
[4:15:42] 91Niki: Yeah
[4:15:49] 91Niki: Directed and written by Krasinski
[4:15:59] CritcobainTV: I've always found scary movies boring :(
[4:16:04] CodyKane: oh man you need to watch those movies, they are fantastic!
[4:16:14] 91Niki: That movie is FAR from boring. It's not your typical horror movie
[4:16:25] zgag: if *
[4:16:35] 91Niki: The one with Chris Pratt yeah
[4:16:38] Tripnbunz: yes i cant wait
[4:16:39] Alaquane: christ pratt movie
[4:16:43] Sincline387: it's pretty good
[4:16:44] daniel85mg: waht movie

[4:16:48] Mecabeast: also blackwidow is out
[4:16:57] h_u_r_k_: he's come so far since the office
[4:16:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: heard it was shit, but i'll probably check it out
[4:17:04] DynkLive: I watched it its good!
[4:17:08] Buckwink: it really does look bad
[4:17:09] Thrixel: @zgag every layer requires 4 stars to progress to next
[4:17:13] Blackoss: Dark was great
[4:17:18] xirangeix: I usually dont like time travel cause time travel is always contradictory but dark was amazing
[4:17:19] 91Niki: Pre premier of Black Widow was this week
[4:17:20] bruhSit_farmer: shadowlands has been one of the better horror movies in the last year imo
[4:17:29] sticksaredrifting: the 3rd purge is out today Kappa
[4:17:32] lithium364: lmao
[4:17:37] xXSiebzehnXx: Dark is great

[4:17:54] Unciatim: Reviewers... Imagine listening to bunch of failed directors, producers and actors/tresses for your movie viewing advice.
[4:17:57] zgag: Does that mean you need multiple 4 stars + or just 1 run
[4:18:01] zgag: to advance
[4:18:08] TheCliffyShow: Can anyone explain to me how the plot of Tomorrow War makes sense. Why bring people from the past to the future to fight a war instead of just prevent the shit from happening in the past.
[4:18:27] Thrixel: @zgag you need 4 stars layer 9 to get to layer 10. Then you need 4 stars layer 10 to get to layer 11
[4:18:30] Bammbino: @Towelliee Is that a specific display case in the back or a collection of different ones?
[4:18:30] 91Niki: I never watched the first A Quiet Place in the theater. Watched the second movie in IMAX. It was soooo worth it!
[4:18:36] xXSiebzehnXx: The controls in the original Tomb Raider was the difficulty of the game
[4:18:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: fun fact that are more polygons on lady dirmestrus ass then the entirety of resident evil 1
[4:18:43] KrimsonElite: Consumption is the worst fucking idea for a rare ever
[4:18:44] xXSiebzehnXx: They were awful
[4:18:50] othraerir: conduit upgrades?
[4:18:55] NVbrutal: think you can get the items to add sockets to gear also
[4:18:56] zgag: @Thrixel Does that apply to each Torghast zone. Ie Skada ect
[4:18:56] sticksaredrifting: can you re run torghast for more tower power?
[4:19:03] pavepawns: cant wait to do adamant vaults next week
[4:19:05] xXSiebzehnXx: @codeman19 yes until max
[4:19:05] GamerKillance: Pets, mounts and maw transmog according to datamine for adament vaults
[4:19:05] sirledros: is there a cap on how much you can progress on the Torghast talent tree this week?
[4:19:13] JibbsZ: the movie explains your question
[4:19:35] Thrixel: @zgag No, just the layer #. The wing doesn't matter. If you unlock layer 10 then all wings have layer 10 once you get 4 stars Layer 9
[4:19:36] lumaday: 180 i believe this week
[4:19:43] TheCliffyShow: Can anyone explain to me how the plot of Tomorrow War makes sense. Why bring people from the past to the future to fight a war instead of just prevent the shit from happening in the past.
[4:19:48] CritcobainTV: I'm excited to unlock adamant vault. I know i can get 5 gem runs, i sent u that screenshot EZ

[4:20:37] pavepawns: ooh new T&E vid
[4:20:37] CritcobainTV: gotta teach ony how to fetch you a beer
[4:21:12] robertjordan83: @Towelliee so you can get layer 10 this week, it says unlocks next week
[4:21:14] r0b928: That’s what the GF is for, have her bring you a drink lol
[4:21:18] Velladyn: Has Blizzard mentioned anything about the spawn rate of rare mobs improving?
[4:21:20] Havenmess: You don't drink beer anymore?!?!
[4:21:24] djvolty: pop a mini fridge in ?
[4:21:25] pavepawns: its analysis of the cinematic so not the weekly yet

[4:21:43] Hoxza: You know when we get our covenant legendaries?

[4:23:41] CritcobainTV: it makes flagellation like a 30 second cd
[4:23:55] zgag: Hoping Blizz can change up the WQ and make it more like Legion

[4:32:47] Buxbomber: @dragonofwolves unfortunately Nvidia just announced they are going to not make anymore 20 series cards so they can focus on the 30 series

[4:33:26] 91Niki: Unless your current GPU died, it's a huge waste of money to buy a 20 series, seeing the price is the same as a 30 series
