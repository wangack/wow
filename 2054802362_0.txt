[1:26:17] fetza108: i am disappointed with the ashenvale pvp event. Bugged as fuck. At 99% you have to wait random tiem to start the event (1-2 hours)..... And i realized agan to do a wailing caverns run as an alliance already impossible (if you are not a streamer or famous player) and no dungeon finder.... These things push me always back to retail but i would love classic.
[1:26:51] fetza108: i just tried out sod

[1:54:49] fetza108: @vulkankragon i just finished in retail the loremaster achievement and i started retail like 2023. july with a new char. that was fun but i think i go back to classic
[1:54:53] lunamoogle: I know a way they could've shortened that paragraph lol
[1:56:23] fetza108: the animations, visual effects can be too much in retail. in classic it is more simple visually. you can see beter what is going on and the fight is a lot slower
[1:56:40] fetza108: this is why i like classic more

[2:48:47] dimofodi: it's funny you grew up in north jersey and had krispy kreme, i grew up in south jersey and hadnt heard of it until i was in the army in oklahoma :D
[2:49:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: my town has a local donut place thats older then I am that kicks the shit out of krispy kreme
[2:49:39] dimofodi: nah it's dunkin
[2:49:42] slow_cheetaah: Fundraiser
[2:49:48] Molvonos: Dunkin's trash too

[2:51:17] Cabbageman007: Cold Coffee with some Caramel flavor creamer
[2:51:20] tr4ncetv: When I was a kid an aunt of mine would flirt with the gas station dude towards end of night so he'd give all the krispy kreme donuts that were left before he would throw them out
[2:51:25] devoted_bee: One of the best coffees I've ever had in my life was from a  gas station
[2:51:25] dimofodi: we didnt do coffee and donuts when i was little, we has 7-11s around but mom and dad werent coffee drinkers so
[2:51:35] KhorCables: it happends with burger king, kfc and mcd in my city, big line the first day and then desert
[2:51:46] Molvonos: @HaxzorJimDuggan Popeyes, Raising Kanes, and Chik-fil-a lines in CA are fucking absurd.
[2:51:46] AzedaNA: When I was in Indonesia they have this coffee called "Kopi Lewak" and it's where this animal eats a berry, shits it out and they refine it into coffee. It's some of the most expensive coffee in the world LUL

[2:53:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: @AzedaNA its also the coffee from the movie The Bucket List that Jack Nicholson has no idea how its made but loves it
[2:53:30] Kneckt: @Kneckt LOL, maybe im just being too ungrateful for it peepoSad
[2:53:44] Kneckt: this reply thing never works right for me lol
[2:54:52] abracka_: all i know is there better be increasing the amount of gear that drops off each boss in gnomer with how many pieces they added in that raid
[2:54:53] SamuraiWillZ916: I play pugs when I‚Äôm not playing with you‚Ä¶. so it makes me nervous
[2:54:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: tokens help prevent wasted loot because you didnt bring the class that wants the set
[2:55:07] abracka_: they better*

[2:59:11] Verdell263: I wonder if the price of gold will plummet in P2 with no GDKPs allowed
[2:59:42] N3llee: there is no gdkp eco system in retail
[3:00:10] Wulfgrym: just play wrath for gdkp
[3:00:10] ShadowzeroXX: ppl will still find ways to do gdkps
[3:00:17] SwagDapper: ran dm from 15-25 on my rogue didn‚Äôt even see cruel barb
[3:00:19] N3llee: @Verdell263 some 3rd party sites have started running "sales".
[3:00:27] Molvonos: Here we go
[3:00:41] AzedaNA: It has to be AI
[3:00:44] Wulfgrym: molv purge
[3:00:50] fewyn: probably the honor system i don't see how they can really enforce it
[3:01:13] Wulfgrym: those characters had families LUL @Molvonos
[3:01:28] DrkPhoenix6913: Molv massacre
[3:01:44] geokouts: oh the Humanity!
[3:01:49] AzedaNA: They referred to it as "new tech" which leads me to believe it's not human monitored. I have a feeling you're going to see a spike in wrongfully banned posts etc
[3:01:51] Mecabeast: Man just saw Toby kieth passed away at 62 from stomach cancer
[3:02:05] Molvonos: 'New Guild, who dis'

[3:05:16] Wildsmasher: 90% buy gold = bots so they F my game over
[3:05:31] Wildsmasher: because i like selling leather but cant because bots farm it 24/7
[3:05:41] N3llee: i think its larger then 1-2% by a lot.
[3:06:05] Wulfgrym: they think gdkp ban will curb gold buying LUL

[3:08:56] PhillyRhino: Go home Towelliee. You're drunk.
[3:09:22] Wulfgrym: you said it private auras, gkdps, its just trying to force players to play how they want and it doesn't work
[3:09:37] Irahh: GDKP "encourages gold buying"
[3:09:54] neosbe: neosbe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[3:09:56] N3llee: it has impacts to the economy over all. Causes inflation. In classic the economy is much more intertwined then in retail.
[3:10:03] Wulfgrym: yeah and gold buying will not go down at all lol
[3:10:04] Krazie_J: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/gdkp-in-season-of-discovery/1777411
[3:10:31] Wulfgrym: it does affect it, it puts all those crazy assclowns in their own little bubble
[3:10:34] sycnessx: can u still sell carries through raids? thats not gdkp thats a carry :D
[3:10:40] Vile_: it impacts the economy, doesn‚Äôt it? maybe the social aspect is just what they‚Äôre saying because they don‚Äôt want to admit the economical effect.
[3:10:45] Noobicron: man i wanted dual spec
[3:10:58] AzedaNA: It's easy to get a distorted view. Reddit was quite literally a toxic shithole of endless "GDKP BAD" posts. That subreddit has some toxic obessions
[3:11:08] Wulfgrym: yeah leave them alone
[3:11:14] Wulfgrym: and they leave us alone
[3:11:15] N3llee: @Vile_ no i dont think so
[3:11:23] desmo7: dual spec will be post lvl 60
[3:11:28] ClassicMalcontent: Blizz just wanted to ban GDKP spammers from chat. Kappa (the FR FR ha ha)
[3:11:51] AzedaNA: @ClassicMalcontent Download the BadBoy addon and it will change your life
[3:11:56] N3llee: at the end of the day not having gdkps will not have any impact to gold buying or selling
[3:11:57] Celicon: my only complaint is the Econ problem that gdkp normally causes
[3:12:03] Wulfgrym: @Vile_ i doubt your going to notice any difference in the economy

[3:39:23] Sollice: @Wulfgrym k
[3:39:46] AzedaNA: Ah, wait
[3:39:49] AzedaNA: "No. As much as fans want to hope otherwise, Yellowstone season 6 is not happening. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that the Dutton family saga is coming to an abrupt end. There are still six more episodes of Yellowstone season 5 that have yet to be filmed. It‚Äôs possible that Paramount Network may promote those episodes as Yellowstone season 6, but they are just an extension of the fifth season."
[3:39:52] OnceAMoose: They want to give him more money, but he doesn't want to have to give any more to his ex-wife.
[3:39:58] polaropposite76: @AzedaNA last thing I had read was there was a final season coming, I don't know what they worked out tho

[4:15:51] CeruleanStar: what i see too many tanks do is try to control the entire pack on every pull and that's just impossible
[4:16:04] CeruleanStar: ** impossible as a warrior at this lvl ? lol
[4:16:18] deanbeo: Think I'm going to main my rogue in phase 2. Had to switch to tank for a group, and it was a lot of fun. Plus the dps is awesome.
