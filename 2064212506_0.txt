[3:13:19] justinthyme222: @buck_nazty  easy there Ted
[3:13:21] HKRazieL: humans - anything that resembles a recognizable item "wow you're pretty good at this" AI - anything that is not absolutely perfect in every possible way to be mistaken for actual reality "this is dog shit"
[3:13:23] loofers: so like 1 year ago the quality was basically shit
[3:13:33] Kirby_The_Pink: watch some on stream
[3:13:33] buck_nazty: @justinthyme222  EZ
[3:13:43] loofers: obviously ai still sure but in 2 years? maybe not

[3:21:21] TheVaroon: yeah, for now it struggle to keep the models constant enough, but I bet this will improve shortly
[3:21:21] sudd7: the thing about some of those videos is, they're actually real. and they say it's AI so people say "obviously it's AI" but it's not AI, proving you cant tell. Kappa
[3:21:23] loofers: can just tell from the examples that it's better

[4:16:24] exeggutorx: You know how to thin i like it KKomrade
[4:16:29] rosittojp: so you have no money because no one pay taxes
[4:16:35] unmatched45: i cant believe people in america nowadays want to try that system. as if its every worked
[4:16:41] rosittojp: so the only way to finance a country is printing money
[4:16:46] rosittojp: and printiing money gives inflation
[4:16:49] buck_nazty: yugoslavia too KKomrade
[4:16:50] rosittojp: ofc
[4:16:54] onegod98: That is true Pshero (< Macedonian here)

[4:17:02] SnakeHelah: Imagine thinking it's gonna be "our means of production" instead of "means of production of those with most power"
[4:17:10] Vir0n: soviet satellites were thriving KKomrade

[4:18:14] gordastico: it sure would stop companies lobbying and disrupting the democratic process
[4:18:15] ExamanteD: theoretically, if my udnerstanding is accurate, you can even have a form of free market under socialism. The cirtical point would be that the people who produce the goods would own them.
