[6:21:58] brodycanuck: The AI must learn that scum is someone bad so they say it that way
[6:22:15] BigFatRestoCow: I love Jurgen Prochnow in the old film, fantastic actor.
[6:22:18] shawnquesty: God created Arrakis to train the faithful, one cannot go against the word of God
[6:23:03] BigFatRestoCow: The reason Prochnow has the marks he has on his face is  becuase of what happend on the set of Dune.
[6:23:22] bistraya_seledka: Astranaar quests are probably lower level because it's local hub, so you're expected to go there first, and then spread out to the outskirts of the location.

[6:23:25] JudieKiley: consider that quest the end of darkshore, not necessarily the start of ashenvale
[6:23:27] negativecody: Just use the good old one shot macro ;) you’ll win every time
[6:23:33] shawnquesty: Is that Dune 1984?

[6:26:06] BigFatRestoCow: Prochnow was the captian in the film Das Boot.
[6:26:06] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, there should be some baskets on the ground or something like that. And there should be undeads nearby not humanoids.
[6:26:10] rasghulz: swift do not do this questy
[6:26:15] JudieKiley: its on the ground, hard to see
[6:26:31] JudieKiley: looks like gray little pieces of grass
[6:26:53] bistraya_seledka: I think you need to pass behind the warlocks to where the undead will start.
[6:27:08] shawnquesty: Was he also in Judge Dredd
[6:27:24] JudieKiley: there was one in front of you slightly to the right
[6:27:42] Beastylol: Be careful on respawns if there are so many farming
[6:27:48] shawnquesty: And beerfest
[6:27:56] BigFatRestoCow: He could well have been. Prochnow had a habbit of turning up as a bad guy in films.
[6:28:14] JudieKiley: yea was the one you got.

[6:33:57] BigFatRestoCow: You do need a swing timer in pvp.
[6:34:13] Frikinmatt: no you dont
[6:34:23] BigFatRestoCow: And its just better to learn the practise in pve.

[10:34:40] MrThinger: like replacing the below average voicelines and make better voices
[10:34:41] FullySuited: Okay it’s called Voiceover (classic)
[10:34:42] kragnos0: sweet, that'd be awesome i'd love to add a line to it
[10:34:46] Spart4nm4n: @doublebansinth dont be posting bitcoin wallet id in here
[10:35:03] ausiemick: @mrthinger with the new module system we should be able to make a standalone voice pack to make one of the NPCs voiced by swift?
[10:35:19] MrThinger: @ausiemick 100% yea
[10:35:22] flye55: genius idea.

[10:36:02] ausiemick: @swifty reach out to MrThingy and we can work to adding an NPC to be voiced by you
[10:36:03] Barimur1: LUL
[10:36:17] prodigiousgaming: You just gave me flashbacks of your good old mw3 free for all videos with the mp7

[10:37:03] ausiemick: But @mrthinger if swifty can just read the lines and redo it how he likes that would be better than 11labs
