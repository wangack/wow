[5:10:00] kitroFPS: wait are u talkin about val

[5:10:13] kitroFPS: 2-0
[5:10:22] Fossabot: How do you earn points on Liquid+? Check here >> https://tl.gg/points
[5:10:38] kitroFPS: didnt watch but i heard bld was up 7-1 first map then it all got fucked after
[5:11:02] kitroFPS: and then they put yay on skye
[5:11:10] kitroFPS: p sure its current patch too lol
[5:11:14] kitroFPS: ppl are scared of gekko
[5:11:50] kitroFPS: an initiator that you can use his flash 7-8 times a round if used efficiently
[5:11:57] Memelord_Ozai: @Mendo any plans to try the new apex or OW season?
[5:12:09] kitroFPS: but skye was so strong for so long that now theyre scared to do shit differently
[5:12:37] kitroFPS: yea bc his flash trajectory and movement is also a little weird
[5:12:45] kitroFPS: and is easy to dodge
[5:12:46] kallysen: i could not imagine having yay and not let him chamber when theyre on breeze & lotus
[5:13:27] kallysen: if chamber dont work on those maps they have bigger issues i fear
[5:13:30] kitroFPS: they ran double ini double controller neon comp in breeze
[5:14:01] kitroFPS: no
[5:14:04] kitroFPS: jett IS good
[5:14:11] kitroFPS: thats the weird thing
[5:14:13] Memelord_Ozai: Would WoW work if they modernized the graphics?
[5:14:15] kitroFPS: neon is NOT played
[5:14:22] kitroFPS: the most i saw neon played was maybe fracture
[5:14:57] kallysen: literally every team plays jett on breeze too
[5:14:58] kallysen: so idk
[5:15:43] kallysen: but if hes gonna neon they cant make him sit on operator
[5:15:43] JDXL: oh talking about bleed?
[5:16:01] JDXL: apparently the team aint getting along very well
[5:16:02] kitroFPS: they played egoist on skye for map 1
[5:16:07] kitroFPS: that was his first time in competition
[5:16:09] kitroFPS: running skye
[5:16:11] kitroFPS: hes a senti
[5:16:28] JDXL: my friend that used to be in bleed told me that team cohesion aint very bussin rn
[5:16:28] kitroFPS: listen
[5:16:30] Memelord_Ozai: Are the two games different content wise? Does Classic WoW has stuff that retail doesn't?
[5:16:38] kitroFPS: Deryeon is a jett player
[5:16:49] kitroFPS: they couldve ran him on jett, yay on chamber
[5:17:14] kitroFPS: and it wouldve been jett chamber viper skye and sova
[5:17:17] kitroFPS: way better
[5:17:27] kitroFPS: but then again like u said, something happened in scrims
[5:17:27] kallysen: chamber is insane on lotus too
[5:17:31] kallysen: xccurate played it against them
[5:17:43] JDXL: but ayy the bleed player are getting that big paycheck

[5:17:54] JDXL: motion
[5:18:05] kitroFPS: chamber is super good on lotus
[5:18:08] kitroFPS: u just put his shit B
[5:18:18] kitroFPS: run 2-1-2 with a rotator on each side
[5:18:37] RangeRns: ok im done trying for now
[5:18:41] RangeRns: i did it twice in a row
[5:18:49] RangeRns: it just gets scarycause im so brain dead i press the wrong trap sometimes
[5:19:06] Memelord_Ozai: idk if u missed my question or ignored it, but incase u missed it: any plans to try the new apex or OW season?
[5:19:18] RangeRns: YEP
[5:19:18] Nightbot: COCK
[5:19:32] JDXL: apex omE
[5:19:39] JDXL: ok NAHHH overwatch
[5:20:08] kitroFPS: they run omen b lotus by breakable, chamber trap b main and he swings out c with tp, breach raze a skye c or u can switch around inis
[5:20:09] JDXL: yeah not like u needed to hit shots on tanks and supports anyways
[5:20:14] kitroFPS: im just yapping
[5:20:17] JDXL: om
[5:21:11] Memelord_Ozai: Projectile shotgun heroes feel great due to the projectile change- Genji, Torb, Zen
[5:21:35] kitroFPS: exactly
[5:21:40] JDXL: prx GIGACHAD
[5:21:45] JDXL: wait no
[5:21:49] JDXL: prx with jinggg GIGACHAD
[5:21:51] kitroFPS: not even joking an  yoru that knows what hes doing is better than most jett comps
[5:21:56] kitroFPS: jinggg is the goat
[5:22:27] JDXL: happie hes using the keyboard i made him
[5:23:02] kitroFPS: the problem with the val comp scene is that rn we have shit adaptability, no one wanted to run the yoru until kanpeki and tenz did now there are yoru comps, at some point we're gonna figure out gekko and how to build around him and then everyone is riding the train, and then he'll get nerfed eventually to omE

[5:24:25] kitroFPS: for lotus i think gekko breach omen any senti really and raze could be INSANE
[5:25:51] kitroFPS: but at the same time i can understand why theyre scared, they have maybe 2 qualifiers for t2 and if they dont make it they miss out for 8 - 10 months so theyre scared of experiementing
[5:26:09] Memelord_Ozai: Is double controller not common on Lotus anymore?
[5:26:34] JDXL: omg i caught my hsr daily before i overfilled
[5:26:36] JDXL: 239
[5:26:44] kitroFPS: thing is val pros have a very small window of success if they dont make challengers theyre just back to working day to day jobs until NEXT YEAR
[5:26:54] kitroFPS: so theyre scared to try shit
[5:29:14] kallysen: yea but the thing is that he was still playing operator on neon
[5:29:17] kallysen: that is so ??
[5:29:27] kitroFPS: i didnt watch
[5:29:38] kitroFPS: im talking purely on stats from vlr and what my friends told me
[5:29:45] kitroFPS: operator on neon breeze is absurd
[5:29:47] Memelord_Ozai: There are a lot of angles only Chamber and Yoru can play on the new Lotus

[6:53:26] Nightbot: This channel needs to hire some proper mods. Chat is just filled with idiotic people spamming mindless copy pastas who cant engage in intelligent conversation about the game being displayed. Its a step back in evolution in my opinionss
[6:53:38] Wasab7i: @Mendo ur coming to bfd?
[6:53:43] JDXL: taxi plays 0.1 actuation
[6:53:43] RangeRns: im 0.4 with rapid trigger at 0.15
[6:53:57] RangeRns: ya
[6:53:58] taxi2g: bro 1.5 why are u even using wooting its just like normal keyboard almost
[6:54:00] RangeRns: so its different im aware
[6:54:05] Wasab7i: yea we are forming a group
[6:54:13] JDXL: yeah 1.5 is normal switch actuation
[6:54:48] taxi2g: yea but rapid trigger only really works if u also have low actuation
[6:55:08] RangeRns: 1.5 is like
[6:55:08] JDXL: u can enable continuous rapid trigger
[6:55:11] RangeRns: 1.1 or something
[6:55:13] taxi2g: i understand that
[6:55:38] taxi2g: sure idk i came from logitech and razer so its upgrade for me wootility
[6:55:57] JDXL: yeah via is like actual programming
[6:55:57] taxi2g: wootility*
[6:56:13] illusive9073: apex pro is bis
[6:56:23] dmn1: boog75 is bis
[6:56:23] RangeRns: ideally u would be able to use rapid trigger with ur switches u like
[6:56:24] taxi2g: apex pro is mid compared to wooting
[6:56:31] JDXL: wootility does more than apex pro brother
[6:56:36] illusive9073: oh wooting, yeah i can't get that delivered here
[6:56:37] dmn1: put wooting in the dust

[6:57:10] JDXL: to my knowledge wooting still has the best scanrate rapid trigger performance
[6:57:27] taxi2g: rapid trigger takes time to learn
[6:57:46] illusive9073: how much yall pay for your wootings
[6:57:50] taxi2g: 220
[6:57:51] feuha: buh
[6:58:09] illusive9073: usd?
[6:58:11] JDXL: my total was like $400
[6:58:13] taxi2g: y
[6:58:25] JDXL: mines custom and i swapped out switches and stuff
[6:58:40] taxi2g: it doesnt work with wow rly
[6:58:47] taxi2g: because u can buffer abilities
[6:58:53] JDXL: wooting + case + weight + stabilizers + switches + plate + keycaps
[6:59:06] JDXL: so pretty much i swapped everything but the pcb
[6:59:13] illusive9073: nice guessing you need a wooting case for sizing
[7:00:25] JDXL: and i experimented with foam and mounting configs to get it to sound passable in my preferences
[7:00:56] taxi2g: jdxl thats autistic as fuck but i know what u mean
[7:01:01] JDXL: yeah
[7:01:06] illusive9073: lol
[7:01:18] taxi2g: i know who im talking to trust me
[7:01:20] Lenge: yo
[7:01:26] illusive9073: i got a keychron k6 and called it a day for portable coding
[7:01:39] JDXL: and in valorant its broken cuz u just let go and u have perfect accuracy
[7:01:51] JDXL: yeah
[7:02:41] JDXL: and its not like u have to fully let go u can just lift it a little shoot and strafe again

[7:03:04] RangeRns: yea elige really liked
[7:03:06] RangeRns: the rapid trigger IIRC
[7:03:08] taxi2g: u can do anything almost on a normal keyboard that u can do on wooting but u have to know that keyboard very well and u have to press A while holding D to come to a stop and such
[7:03:23] JDXL: pretty much every valorant pro in singapore is using the wooting
[7:03:24] taxi2g: wooting just has best rapid trigger/actuation
[7:03:35] disquared: !gamble 444
[7:03:35] StreamElements: disquared lost 444 points in roulette and now has 121527 points! FeelsBadMan
[7:03:49] JDXL: i think he meant normal switches
[7:03:50] taxi2g: on a normal keyboard when strafing in valo/cs
[7:04:08] taxi2g: like if u let go of a key to stop its slower than pressing other key
[7:04:38] JDXL: mhm u have to release it past the deactivation point for it to deactivate but not with rapid trigger
[7:05:08] JDXL: yeah the 45 are 52g
[7:05:21] JDXL: cuz if u take it apart
[7:05:25] JDXL: the springs are hufe
[7:05:27] JDXL: huge
[7:05:34] Lenge: y’all talking keyboards?
[7:05:36] JDXL: like 3x the diametere
[7:05:39] RangeRns: @Lenge yes
[7:06:14] JDXL: Kreygasm my BCP switches tho

[7:07:04] JDXL: yeah true
[7:07:19] RangeRns: honestly now that ur talking about weight
[7:07:33] RangeRns: i do wanna try lighter switches
[7:07:40] RangeRns: cause its why im using like a 0.4 actuation point
[7:07:48] RangeRns: cause the initial pressure to press down
[7:08:02] RangeRns: yea that makes sense
[7:08:16] JDXL: heavier switches are nicer for typing not that much forr fps cuz u have to hold it down
[7:08:23] JDXL: the stock 60 are 68
[7:08:28] RangeRns: damn
[7:08:42] Lenge: should i cop a wooting
[7:08:44] RangeRns: wait how hard is it to swap switches JD
[7:08:53] JDXL: easy
[7:08:55] JDXL: realyl easy
[7:08:56] RangeRns: like me a noob could i do it no problem
[7:09:00] JDXL: yeah
[7:09:13] JDXL: tealios are 67g
[7:09:28] JDXL: 50
[7:09:34] JDXL: kpp are 50g
[7:09:47] JDXL: it prolly feels heavier
[7:09:49] JDXL: cuz of the bump
[7:09:55] Flyshoot3r: Mendo is Glimmering Gizmo gonna be BIS over Rod for Spriest you think?
[7:10:09] taxi2g: how can u swap switches on wooting i thought its hall switches?
[7:10:18] JDXL: u just take em out
