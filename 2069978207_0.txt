[0:29:15] takhsick: just show up and start rambling your outlaw rogue rotation with a bottle of grey goose in hand
[0:29:23] diesel_patrol: I don't like the idea of being too close with neighbours because then its awkward when you aren't in the mood for interaction
[0:29:25] ashraf_ma: Explain to them the sub rogue opener @Pikabooirl
[0:29:30] Ivankov912: cant have a line of bushes?

[0:29:47] Bombdiggity3315: dont count on it. Associations attract all types
[0:29:53] moistydank: low key it might not be a bad idea to go. then if you have a party or anything that could maybe piss someone off, they might care less if you are somewhat social with them ya know? could be worth being somewhat social. go there for like 30 min or an hour, show your face say hi then dip lol
[0:29:54] matt_caste: They're gonna talk about you on nextdoor 100%

[0:32:06] poroyou: If you were renting I would be like whatever, but since you're planning to stay you want to start off on the right foot
