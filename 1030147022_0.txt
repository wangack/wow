[3:21:00] Reckless_Monk: 100%
[3:21:02] magemaster225: its weird though spacey has had 2 accusers and both have randomly died before trial 🤔
[3:21:04] KingsandClubs: I mean wasen’t he accussed of raping a young actor

[3:21:11] theDirtyon3: what is going on in chat right now.. lol

[3:22:00] KingsandClubs: I like the “aren’t you gonna wish a happy fathers day” and goes down her
[3:22:05] MasqureMan: Kevin spacey is a lesson that your response to an allegation can’t be “oh I’m gay”
[3:22:09] pixxelina: lol
[3:22:11] MrTerkyMan: Expanse is so good just finished it for the first time. Not a fan of how a certain thing happened in the latest season but...

[3:24:44] George2001k: You want to make a good movie? You hire Sean Bean and then you kill Sean Bean.
[3:24:45] anttrocitygaming: First and second Silent Hill
[3:24:45] BTiZZY_: honestly rewatching the show it is not as surprising either. rob makes so many decisions that def hint to his demise.
[3:24:53] AtomicHeartSon: Runed Scroll is a looted quest
[3:24:55] cineris_3: Not Troy, you know he gets lost on the way home

[3:29:19] crumbler81: I would probably be more okay with dungeon boosts if they were free. Mages probably make plenty from loot
[3:29:22] unrealforreal: Ret poped off at the end of TBC when they got Divine storm and could 1 shot everyone in pvp

[5:23:41] 770Cash: They dont care, they just dont want to be "canceled"
[5:23:42] Armdel: Finally a category worthy of my follow
[5:23:43] Nokterian: get that money ladies, stop hating
[5:23:43] Atruis_: omg...

[5:24:46] Nokterian: Ok i hear people hating here but i guess a lot of Men will go look anyway LUL
[5:24:47] Nevindaz: Kappa
[5:24:49] GorSTL: i guess that's actually good for actual Just Chatting channels. Less hot tubs at top of group
[5:25:00] Nokterian: Like really men you dont like women?
[5:25:02] Collected1: they'll just switch to 'stretches' and 'bed streams'
[5:25:03] Nokterian: LUL
[5:25:09] CoffeeDeus: @pixelins 13 year olds can stream on twitch lol - imagine twitch allowing 13 year old hot tub streams
[5:25:10] 91Niki: Right @Towelliee but wearing a BDSM outfit and doing "yoga" is not chilling at the pool ...
[5:25:12] Knocx: twitch is a fucking gaming site, not soft core porn
[5:25:15] Jarless: what lvl is he now?
[5:25:16] andycoin99: Yeah this is America dress up how ya want
[5:25:16] Ramzilla92: it is ez smart $$$
[5:25:17] Deadlytvstudios: @Towelliee  would you still be streaming on twitch if it went to adult content sucxh as porn
[5:25:18] sharie: Do people not know how to google to see shit for free in better quality ?
[5:25:24] Nevindaz: we have animals instincts..
[5:25:26] 770Cash: They walk the line and get rewarded
[5:25:29] raldrik: "stretching"
[5:25:31] ProClicker: If you're not hot you'll get banned like the shirtless fat guys
[5:25:33] pixxelina: @CoffeeDeus disgusting really
[5:25:35] ActuallyNico: Same
[5:25:36] shadowmoonsmile: LUL
[5:25:36] Artivicii: "ive seen too much of that"
[5:25:36] 11000BG: its pathetic..
[5:25:36] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee 1 sub - 5 squads infront of the camera Kappa
[5:25:37] froodyo: SQUATS FOR SUBS
[5:25:38] froodyo: lol
[5:25:39] Rujean: But Towelliee I am not a stripper this oily male body dressed like this is my beach attire. :D
[5:25:41] bigsing: NBA2k21 any good, free on epic?
[5:25:44] alibynx: is twitch a general livestream site or a gaming streaming site?
[5:25:46] davysaurus: girl yesterday was not wearing a bikini.  She was in a lacy bra and panties on the front page
[5:25:48] YNR_Chewmiester: What about the streamers that bend over to write on a white board. They know what they're doing.
[5:25:54] Archon86: possible pools, tubs ads incoming???
[5:25:54] Slinky309: You mean the one dry humping a bananna
[5:25:57] 91Niki: @Towelliee There's literally a chick in a BDSM outfit doing "yoga" at a swimming pool. That's the shit i don't understand is okay
[5:25:58] zgag: Twitch is moving closer to porn with channels like that. They also have their OF listed in their twitter.  OF shows far more than what they do on Twitch
[5:26:02] EggLar: its called only fans, get hot-tubbing out of twitch

[5:26:58] Wildside1177: You were going the wrong way
[5:27:05] 91Niki: I mean if twitch does wanna make a porn section. Fine. But, make a separate site then. and not on a website that says 13+ 🤷
[5:27:10] SonofHorus82: wow RIP Just Chatting.
[5:27:15] froodyo: boost can not be used on new races

[5:27:44] butt_face2000: Mt. Hyjal Raid music is bis
[5:27:44] zgag: All it's going to do is take for one 14 year old girl to take the mantle and do a hot tub stream. Twitch is playing with fire
[5:27:52] 91Niki: https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/nhzqmd/twitch_adds_a_pools_hot_tubs_and_beaches_category/

[5:28:02] Morpheusx25: @zgag scary
[5:28:21] 91Niki: They're like " twitch created their own booba.tv" LUL
[5:28:30] andycoin99: Fr zgag
[5:28:32] CoffeeDeus: @91Niki If they're going to allow it then they should also age restrict the content. 13 year olds are also capable of streaming themselves
[5:28:33] mattenCRO: is twitch a porn site now?

[5:29:24] 91Niki: @CoffeeDeus 13 year olds are capable of clicking "I agree i'm 18+" tho. If twitch wants to move in that direction, fine. But it NEEDS to be on a separate website.
[5:29:41] n00batplay: ^
[5:29:46] SonofHorus82: wow TIL you could mark an entire category as Not Interested.
[5:30:00] andycoin99: @sharie I feel like twitch is smarter than that they got the fine print down to a science
[5:30:11] 11000BG: imagine how boring it must be to sit in a fuckin tub for 3 hours.. such a miserable life
[5:30:14] Casual_Greg_: In short... twitch profits sky rocketed during this "trend" and staffers dont mind moderating the rooms either
[5:30:21] 91Niki: It's like streaming porn on nickelodeon after 12am, you just can't do that
[5:30:22] CoffeeDeus: @91Niki I'm more so referring to the possibility of a 13 year old hosting a hot tub stream themselves lol - so restricting the ability to host that type of content to legal adults
[5:30:30] Paramourn: boring? they are setting themselves up for a yeast infection in water that long
[5:30:39] TheUnknowing: Not so boring when you are making a shit ton of money @11000BG lol

[5:31:07] HeBeDead: twitch is so innovative :)
[5:31:21] Ashekor: its kinda interesting that they're giving it a category but they just removed ads from one of the hot tub streamer's channel
[5:31:28] Slinky309: i watched porn at 8 years old if a kid wants to watch a hot tub stream they will same goes for a porn site
[5:31:30] Ardailec: Feels like such a non issue to be upset about to me
[5:31:37] 91Niki: @Towelliee I agree, i think the biggest issue is allowing content like this on a platform where kids hang out too. Then you need to make a separate website. It's honestly just not safe.
[5:31:41] Burntlettuce: Truth is twitch wouldn't be doing it if it didn't make money
[5:31:43] Berexios123: atleast make it have to be outside its funny to see pools inside a room
[5:31:46] NickLeonhearth: Yea, but when the streamer has a link that say "see the fun stuff here" that leads to nudes on only fans....well do you really want that as twitch :D
[5:31:48] dibreno: is trading retail gold for classic allowed? @towelliee
[5:31:57] andycoin99: @ardailec I agree I’m all for it lol
[5:32:00] sharie: @Dankifide_ its Twitch we are Talking about here they also allow Animals being Treated like shit and they dont Care
[5:32:05] 91Niki: lol
[5:32:09] flickerzz94: @Towelliee That experience WA - Is that on wagio? Or Is it a specific one you made?
[5:32:15] LucienM: I don’t give a shit tbh, it’s just they suspend people for minor things and then let risqué things get official. Like a dude can’t stream with his shirt off?
[5:32:21] pixxelina: @Slinky309 that doesn t mean a platform mainly for gamers should serve it
[5:32:22] Cowmasutra: @flickerzz94 I think that's Luxthos' weakaura for exp
[5:32:24] rhodeos_: soon(tm)
[5:32:41] 91Niki: Yeah
[5:32:43] zgag: I doubt that they will enforce in section deal.  Amouranth does her ASMR streams on chatting and twitch created an ASMR channel
[5:32:44] Knocx: so can i stream my weightlifting in a speedo right?
[5:32:58] CodyKane: snafu3 is continuing the Gift Sub they got from not_pr0!

[5:33:08] Artivicii: makes sense

[5:33:12] Broomba: will we see a Goldshire Moonguard RP section on twitch ?

[5:47:17] Mystirose: Pallys and Locks get a spell to summon at 30 and it gives you 75 riding. Just did it on my Lock
[5:47:26] Biorrwolf: @nohitjerome I see you everywhere

[6:04:28] Artivicii: oooo wait it worked pre 2.3 i think

[6:06:00] Moobot: @Towelliee @zgag will not get timed out for the next 3m (@Towelliee)
[6:06:06] hammack52: the damage reduction works but the damage reflect will not work if you do not have a shield equiped cause you can not block with no shield
[6:06:09] uberstyle: hey towelliee any way we can get your ui for tbc ?
[6:06:12] TheItalianStallion321: there is a hot tub and pool category LOL this is becoming pathetic
[6:06:24] HeBeDead: coh spammin booba

[6:06:52] 91Niki: he replied to it
[6:06:54] 3dRes: @TheItalianStallion321 at this point Twitch are blatantly encouraging it, and no doubt given up
[6:06:56] TrippyJerms: better then it being in just chatting
[6:06:56] hammack52: careful with ECS on it can mess with with the stats on your sheet, they will sometimes read wrong
[6:07:01] schlongconnery39: How many needles are down here?
[6:07:13] NickLeonhearth: Not good: Most of the rest of the article.
[6:07:38] HeBeDead: does coh have good opinions?
[6:07:43] TheItalianStallion321: @3dRes yeah i agree. they are making $$ off it
[6:07:47] CaptainJoeyNY: let people make money, if you dont like the content DONT watch it
[6:08:02] HeBeDead: joey it just isnt that simple LULW
[6:08:04] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee can Towelliee after dark be streamed under the new category now? I mean if soft core porn is allowed...?
[6:08:11] CaptainJoeyNY: I dissagree with that. people watch what they wanna watch
[6:08:19] TrippyJerms: i think it's good to be in a separate category then just chatting at least

[6:08:36] schlongconnery39: The only bar i have studied for revolves around beer lol
[6:08:38] Comrade_Reaper: also looks bad for other streamers as people who are not familiar with twitch will go on the site and see that shit
[6:08:54] TheUnknowing: The whole reason for twitch initially was for gaming, but at this point it's just reverted back to justin.
[6:08:57] CaptainJoeyNY: @HeBeDead Please elaborate
[6:08:58] auralfX: didnt justin originally become twitch to focus more on games?
[6:09:09] Vita_activa: I feel like that would be very difficult to prove statistically
[6:09:11] 3dRes: @TheItalianStallion321 that's the problem. The more hate and exposure it gets, the more Twitch gets dayDerp
[6:09:30] GodKingMuninn: Theres eventually gonna be a plateua of where your 'genre' isn't really going to net that many new people. More variety would just increase the likelihood of discovery though

[6:10:03] Nerendis: I remember when it was made for StarCraft... rip
[6:10:08] CaptainJoeyNY: I watch more art streams on twitch, hell, Lula cooks on twitch.
[6:10:10] hammack52: @Towelliee to answer your question about the sanc blessing, if you do not have a shield equipped you can not block, so no reflect damage, but the damage reduction will still work just fine
[6:10:11] dylan_cabs: original intent of twitch was for a guy to stream his life, not even games
[6:10:15] Nico_vdM: lol there is already 24k viewers in the hot tub categoery
[6:10:19] 3dRes: @Towelliee you gotta see this https://twitter.com/imSethDrums/status/1395817613708701698 KEKW
[6:10:22] ncsu_riggs: I'm enjoying the new category.. there's several guys memeing the girls
[6:10:29] mattyjono: anyone have a video of how to install his UI
[6:10:43] GodKingMuninn: But now you attract hornies who want soft core and once they're done they might want gaming. It goes both ways @Towelliee
[6:10:44] HeatherJC83: but if you come looking for games you will watch games. 2 different groups of people really
[6:10:44] mytherel: more categories should be a good thing, more exposure means there are more chances someone may stumble onto your stream and stay for a bit
[6:10:53] Comrade_Reaper: justin.tv was originally just for games not IRL streaming...
[6:10:53] datmikez: i miss when you could get suspended for not showing any gameplay on twitch
[6:10:54] arnthetemplerider: BoW man
[6:10:54] 32shades_ofdark: Last year i showed my nephew twitch, some mario streams or whatever. this year i havent shown them shit LUL twitch is off the deep end
[6:11:04] HeBeDead: 3dRes THIS IS CONTENT
[6:11:08] Herzenliegen: LOL
[6:11:13] Dkgungo: looks like a floaty
[6:11:14] myfunkyself: lol
[6:11:15] DelcoAF: Twitch is turning to A/S/L?
[6:11:16] SkyJack1090: yup i agree 100% and im with the OG take if im being honest but you gotta adapt if you wanna live in peace
[6:11:17] TwoFacedFlan: sounds like she sharts with the sound on

[6:12:20] HeBeDead: 18yr+
[6:12:24] CaptainJoeyNY: the slippery slope argument is a conservative rhetoric move to keep change from happening.
[6:12:24] lolbigtrool: i realy want now to se towelliee is a hotub with a bikine noe :P

[6:13:00] duhworks: mobile games with a water proof phone

[6:14:00] Pannekaker: @dylan_cabs Justin, the guy behind Justin.tv, was the first streamer on there and he only streamed IRL
[6:14:10] TheLoneRanger2016: @Towelliee problem is when you let certain type of content go then that line keeps moving back on what should be allowed and then before you know it you have a hot mess on your hands with people abusing the system for gains.

[6:20:48] Ldysansa: Are mage good to have in BC?

[8:02:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: because now they need content
[8:02:19] LanRadio: Because deluxe editions actually come with the game

[8:03:10] zon_57: @Towelliee THANK YOU, I've been wondering the SAME thing, even though its classic, its still a Collector's/deluxe, so whats the problem if it gives a mount? Its also TWO mounts, one for each, seems pretty decent versus previous CE/DE

[8:03:33] Kattaztrophy: Towel did you get the netherwhelp pet ? if you purchased the original collectors tbc you get the pet in classic

[10:41:21] stallowned: if u liked wrath i think u will like BC
[10:41:28] Aquadriel: ttry it out if you have the time, i mean is included in the sub so why not
[10:41:40] Horseweave: The experience is probably worth.

[10:44:28] BJofBorg: Sounds delicious
[10:44:34] Horseweave: I've wanted to play Feral Druid in TBC
[10:44:42] cocytusfgc: Rogues are one of the top dps in BC it's kind of silly.

[10:46:39] YNR_Chewmiester: @ishamael85 hmm. Maybe I'll level the rogue to 70 first. Hopefully dungeons don't end up like Classic where everybody wants only mages for dps.

[11:10:18] mursherago: My take on it is so simple - we are here for a reason, why do thots seep into every fabric of our existence. I feel like thottery is the "ads" of the normal world
[11:10:24] dcmaniac11: It’s cowboys vs buccaneers
[11:10:44] Willamd: yeah but those streams also need to be age gated

[11:20:34] YNR_Chewmiester: 600g not bad he says. Anyone else here a poor boi? LUL
[11:20:43] Oddinlul: I read an article that theres 7k gold in quests from questing at 70 in TBC, assuming i dungeon grind the entire thing
[11:20:51] telethen: i just seen a space goat level 49 shaman on pagal unreal
[11:20:51] DreamWebb: @Commander_Eggi yeah its not the buffs and stuff its just the modern / private server commnuty mentality that everyones adapated now /. people think they need to play that way
[11:20:58] fusionred1991: multi questing can make you loads of gold do it all the time and you get plenty of exp too.
[11:21:28] sandduz1: Scarlet set
[11:21:50] EKS90_: @Commander_Eggi Yah I can see that, I would just try to find a guild that is more chill about it, and work from there, I have a guild that is sweating in the maingroup with naxx, but have other teams and even a "dad team" for people who have kids etc, so its pretty neat.
[11:21:56] BJofBorg: towOny

[11:40:16] Comrade_Reaper: yeah the best position to raid lead is tank or healer
[11:40:19] Lesrek: @Aphro_Samurai In mythic prog, dps is very difficult
[11:40:27] DecayedmiNt: @Lesrek No he didn't. it's easier to  lead as range dps
[11:40:43] laughing_octopus: tanks matter in m+
[11:40:48] Aphro_Samurai: @Lesrek i could imagine. have to be on top of the roto plus mechanics etc.
[11:40:57] laughing_octopus: a good tank is what make a m+
