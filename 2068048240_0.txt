[0:15:06] cantfindthebox: porn on Apple vr gonna be lit
[0:15:11] sukoWoW: i've watched my tv for a total of like... 2 hrs since the new year
[0:15:12] combobulous: 4k projectors have came so far its def worth looking into if you have the wall space, my Tv is on a stand and its outrageous
[0:15:14] drfeltgood: I have an 83 inch and its not that big of an upgrade form 77
[0:15:15] Blindactivity: when’s warrior practice?

[0:15:58] ligmalolkekw: OLED is worth
[0:16:00] ebub1: pika boo what’s good bro
[0:16:01] nsilva94: OLED is the wave

[0:16:08] huevoslol123: Shop around. You shopping at some mom and pop shop?
[0:16:12] tangdill: k
[0:16:19] dmcyi: the tech
[0:16:21] Uberbane: the Samsung 77" OLED is brighter than the LG C3 and they're the same price. But LG has Dolby Atmos and Samsung only has HDR10+
[0:16:23] cantfindthebox: I messed up and started drinking and don’t get food

[0:16:43] dizzyy_oce: they do TV stuff
[0:16:43] cantfindthebox: lasic
[0:16:46] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: OLED is a different technology. each pixel is individually lit which creates a true black for contrast. difference in price is Color, Contrast, Clarity it’s like buying a computer’s better the processor the better the quality
[0:16:48] huevoslol123: Samsung is top rated tvs
[0:16:48] KhaozGamingx: Sam’s club
[0:16:50] CovidiousOG: imagine seeing an 80inch bbc on that tv

[0:18:03] takhsick: costco/sams club stay away from places like best buy. best buy is always overpriced

[0:20:43] dizzyy_oce: @Pikabooirl "The LG C3 OLED and Samsung S90C OLED are similar TVs occupying the same market position. Of the two, the Samsung is the better gaming TV and slightly better overall TV, while the LG is the better TV for movie fans. The Samsung has a wider color gamut and gets brighter than the LG, especially in HDR; not only that, but it also maintains its HDR brightness better in Game Mode. "

[0:52:44] Suchacrisis: chicken is healthiest
[0:52:45] Wottl: especially lean beef, that stuff and eggs are the most bio available stuff out there
[0:52:49] GoSolarASAP: we don't eat no 80/20 ground beef around here
[0:52:50] swolegreekgod: ground turkey > ground beef
[0:52:53] gianni_gsp: @Captain_Crayolas Soy-boy: Conspiracy
[0:53:00] rfsat: @swolegreekgod THIS
[0:53:02] gianni_gsp: @swolegreekgod yeah, absolutely not.
[0:53:05] swaf44: a pack of chips has more calories
[0:53:08] ligmalolkekw: its gotta be lean beef, i hate fatty beef
[0:53:11] GoSolarASAP: ground beef aka real red meat > turkey all day
[0:53:19] cantfindthebox: chagnge that mentality to positive. pika
[0:53:23] GoSolarASAP: turkey does not have the nutrients that ground beef does
[0:53:24] lightsflux: ground beef and rice is the goat meal ate it all prep up til like 3 weeks out lmao
[0:53:25] GoSolarASAP: that's why you eat both
[0:53:31] GoSolarASAP: LMAO big lettuce

[0:53:59] Nyzoh: aand all of them get a heart atack at 40  bro...
[0:54:11] s3izur3s: @Pikabooirl is this rogue name gibberish or stand for something?
[0:54:12] Wottl: it's basically about making the protein not get boring
[0:54:13] poroyou: a lot of bodybuilders die from heart related illnesses too though
[0:54:14] matt_caste: you had me until you said to eat plants like an effin rabbit
[0:54:17] gianni_gsp: eggs, beef, butter
[0:54:19] GoSolarASAP: @Cuddle_Bunz it's a great protein source tho. when I was eatin 6 meals a day, 2 were ground beef, 2 were grilled chicken breasts, and 2 were ground turkey
[0:54:20] ligmalolkekw: meat is good for you but beef (especially high fat beeef) can cause flair ups in some people where turkey and chicken doesnt
[0:54:20] gianni_gsp: and feta cheese
[0:54:27] DINGODOGGERDUDE: juice yep
[0:54:27] IGna7iusIV: that;'d be the drugs lol
[0:54:28] Cuddle_Bunz: all the science saying red meat is bad for your heart has been debunked in the last 10 years
[0:54:28] Captain_Crayolas: because the steroids
[0:54:29] zylbo: wait, stepped him so he can't coil you? how does that work?
[0:54:36] bitcoinonlyfans: @pikabooirl that’s the recipe to larp as a ripped paper bag?
[0:54:36] ShutrMcGavin: quinoa
[0:54:38] GoSolarASAP: @poroyou very few bodybuilders die from heart related illnesses bro, that's the dumbest statistic i've ever heard lmfao
[0:54:40] atorob: ppl at work went and got chickens so now they are bringing free eggs in all the time to give out, ive been racking up lmfao
[0:54:44] Enazx: diet soda is goated
[0:54:48] GoSolarASAP: very few bodybuilders die in general lol tf
[0:54:48] pvprocks: you need fat to build muscle, skinny people have trouble building muscle always
[0:54:53] randyman26: lollll i remember when everyone was freaking out about aspartame
[0:54:54] Arthyius: why the hell can I never get lava burst procs when I play Ele???
[0:54:56] randyman26: wild
[0:54:57] thamysticog: water is the hack
[0:54:59] ignisae3: sprite zero bb
[0:55:05] ligmalolkekw: by the time u get cancer from diet soda ur gonna be dead anyway
[0:55:07] Bzarks: @GoSolarASAP they just undead?
[0:55:08] dgumby: all america food is so many chemicals for you
[0:55:10] GoSolarASAP: gotta eat more than 3 meals a day if you wanna gain boys
[0:55:14] ShutrMcGavin: diet sodas are fucking terrible for you, might as well have the sugar
[0:55:14] GoSolarASAP: it's all about that caloric surplus
[0:55:18] FateIRL: do you ever cast icefury on ele?
[0:55:19] playboymike_: diet soda is crazy lol, you wont die from it but the cancer will lol
[0:55:20] Tinmania: There are a few guarantees in life, and death is one of them
[0:55:22] theonebrenz: new study shows diet soda is the hack @Pikabooirl
[0:55:36] Wottl: i think the reason people think bodybuilders are unhealthy is becuse you always hear about the bodybuilder dying, but the person just randomly dying of diabetes from lack of exercise nobody talks about
[0:55:44] pvprocks: dosn't mean they are right lol
[0:55:47] atorob: everyones body is different, you just gotta find what works for you and go with it
[0:56:03] GoSolarASAP: @Bzarks he stated it as if it's like a crazy problem, i'm saying they die just as much as any other human does naturally. they don't die more than anyone else.. if that makes sense/
[0:56:11] theonebrenz: steroids related deaths are at the bottom of causes of death
[0:56:19] GoSolarASAP: @atorob this 100%
[0:56:24] ligmalolkekw: body builders are dying from steroids and enlarged heart not calorie surplus
[0:56:28] DINGODOGGERDUDE: ronnie coleman is still alive, kinda fucked up but alive
[0:56:28] GoSolarASAP: @theonebrenz bingo
[0:56:31] randyman26: wreckedd
[0:56:31] theonebrenz: steroids aren't inherently bad its ABUSE thats bad
[0:56:33] Johnykarate: ive seen alot of studies where people who dont  diet soda's lose weight cuz it helps with cravings a lot

[0:57:04] atorob: all of the zero sodas are goated, best invention in a long time
[0:57:07] ShutrMcGavin: either dont have the sugar, or drink a real soda

[0:57:29] theonebrenz: @GoSolarASAP been on that TRT health never been better, blood work is perfect
[0:57:32] ultideath: Would you recommend any steroids for chatters looking to live fast and die young?
[0:57:33] joebroegan: don't talk about it, be about it
[0:57:35] kingmason90: pika gonna be lookin like Sam sulek soon mashing that damn keyboard haha
[0:57:37] GoSolarASAP: everybody wants to preach a one size fits all in fitness.. which is the polar opposite of the truth
[0:57:47] Wottl: @theonebrenz how has trt treated your hairline etc? any issues pop up
[0:57:48] GoSolarASAP: @theonebrenz mental state is on another level too. motivated as fuck
[0:57:49] watkinscj: theres a wild amount of fitness misinformation
[0:57:56] mastacastah: Pika we need to get you on a workout stream with Baj
[0:57:57] Schwantes2: greek yogurt with protein poweder is good
[0:58:10] s3izur3s: what about the studies that aspartame is harmful? @Pikabooirl
[0:58:14] DINGODOGGERDUDE: I'm too drunk but would be fun to play, disc priest here
[0:58:17] GoSolarASAP: what you put in is what you get out. abs are made in the kitchen
[0:58:18] Ssolemn: it's like twitchful gladiators trying to tell you how to play. They talk the talk, but no walk the walk
[0:58:24] GoSolarASAP: 80% diet, 20% gym for sure
[0:58:35] GoSolarASAP: you can lift 7 days a week but if you eat 2 meals a day you'll never see results
[0:58:43] Voriq: alcohol better + it fixes your problems facts
[0:58:45] DINGODOGGERDUDE: yuck
[0:58:45] oceanmanfl: i got jacked in one year

[0:58:58] Nightbot: Youtube autoplay
[0:59:01] Wottl: pika youd definitely benefit from a good bulk though fr
[0:59:02] pr1maris: pika please can you oil up for bathroom bong stream
[0:59:03] ShutrMcGavin: tequila soda water every time
[0:59:06] randyman26: beer*
[0:59:09] Suchacrisis: you can be jacked like bajh and just eat chicke/rice/broccoli 3x a day everyday, but also blowin your brains out from eating that everyday
[0:59:10] takhsick: high fruc corn syrup is the actually the worst
[0:59:10] rembrandt89: bud light is terrible who drinks that dogshit
[0:59:11] DINGODOGGERDUDE: just drink normal beer
[0:59:22] s3izur3s: how does that compare to aspartame? @Pikabooirl
[0:59:26] DINGODOGGERDUDE: the sugar is what fucks you
[0:59:26] Ivanrah: SO MANY DHS smh
[0:59:26] oceanmanfl: depends on your genetics tbh
[0:59:27] theonebrenz: @Wottl my hair genetics are superb... all family has hair into their 70's 80's.. so I have not seen issues. Some people do because their body turns the test into DHT
[0:59:29] Wrbursch: @Pikabooirl can you queue with a dh? not a lot of options I know
[0:59:33] randyman26: @rembrandt89 same i quit drinking light beers at 21
[0:59:39] cantfindthebox: all i eat is chicken nuggies
[0:59:47] DINGODOGGERDUDE: or that yeah
[0:59:52] theonebrenz: @theonebrenz aromatizes into dht more for some people depends on genetics
[0:59:52] Wottl: @theonebrenz lucky guy, my family has the hair loss genes and that's keeping me from it
[0:59:56] itsjoexx: nice
[0:59:57] oceanmanfl: @cantfindthebox LUL
[1:00:09] cantfindthebox: song!
[1:00:10] pr1maris: white claws lowkey fuck the gains tho…
[1:00:15] cantfindthebox: what;s thta song tho
[1:00:27] DINGODOGGERDUDE: aspartame can cause problems but it's honestly way better than sugar
[1:00:27] oceanmanfl: just dont drink mixed drinks
[1:00:27] hellfiremetal: actually the body processes apartame differently than real sugar. So if u make a jack diet coke you'll get drunk faster
[1:00:27] s3izur3s: so the aspartame mixed drinks dont leave you as hungover?
[1:00:32] Voriq: chat realizes alcohol is not good for you Top 10 Moments right here
[1:00:32] watkinscj: @cantfindthebox lights ellie goulding
[1:00:35] theonebrenz: @Wottl A good doctor will hear your concerns and monitor. There are options on top of trt that protect from dht conversion
[1:00:41] Johnykarate: i was 270 at the beginning of school year. with just switching to low cal foods and diet soda ive lost 50 pound in less then a year
[1:00:44] Captain_Crayolas: I mean look is water better than diet soda yes but like diet is infinitely better than sugar
[1:00:45] takhsick: cherry coke zero is my best friend idc
[1:00:58] Wottl: @theonebrenz my thought is if i go trt, i would go light trt, and supplement finasteride to prevent dht into hair molecules
[1:01:01] CovidiousOG: Diet Coke for sugar drinks and zyn for cocaine
[1:01:02] GalachadQT: accurate tho

[1:02:04] ShutrMcGavin: The WHO's advice is based on a scientific review that found products containing aspartame and stevia—often marketed as diet foods—likely don't help reduce body fat in the long term. “People should reduce the sweetness of the diet altogether,” Francesco Branca, WHO director for nutrition and food safety, said Monday.May 16, 2023

[1:02:14] rembrandt89: carcinogens are healthy I consume them daily
[1:02:24] ShutrMcGavin: synthetic sweeteners are just as bad
[1:02:25] Nanoke007: whats up man
[1:02:25] Wottl: a similar thought is how a new golf player will just try to make contact, and a pro will tell you all you need is contact, but a mid player will tell you 7 different stance cues
[1:02:41] Tinmania: consume less calories and burn more calories is the recipe to losing weight. No more diets, make lifestyle changes
[1:02:46] fazejdc: Im getting my hair transplant next month :D
[1:02:49] ShutrMcGavin: @Pikabooirl they are probably on steroids
[1:02:50] poroyou: some of it is genetics

[1:03:02] i_Static: they’re on gear
[1:03:04] Suchacrisis: I lost 60 lbs last year, get asked constantly how I did it. Quit eating sugar. It's that simple.

[1:04:43] ultideath: Man fuck that tobacco and sugar shit. Go straight for cocaine
[1:04:55] ShutrMcGavin: any synthetic sweetener is bad for you, might as well have the sugar if you're going to do it. You obviously shouldn't have soda in general though

[1:05:20] zekjojo: synthetic sweetener is bad for you, can you elaborate

[1:05:30] i_Static: @theonebrenz a cop out for what? I’m not saying don’t lift or have goals, I just mean keep them realistic & don’t compare to other people
[1:05:44] Tablxtte: Why is everyone drinking soda in the usa?
[1:05:45] absterge: I'm going to eat a lot of teddy grahams now
[1:05:47] drreww: and thats why i just opened up door dash
[1:05:53] MisterRonB: So got a dark joke: Why were the twin towers mad on 9/11? They ordered pepperoni pizzas, and two planes instead.

[1:06:13] ShutrMcGavin: @GoSolarASAP why? you're stupid
[1:06:13] GoSolarASAP: if you want diabetes, drink soda with sugar and not diet soda lmao. it comes down to the INSULIN SPIKE and your INSULIN sensitivity. DIET soda does not cause an INSULIN SPIKE like real soda with sugar does. sugar is far worse

[1:08:13] i_Static: a burger, steak and yams, shake that he takes 4 hours to drink
[1:08:24] ShutrMcGavin: @GoSolarASAP Sure thing. Do you know what your body does with synthetic sweeteners?

[1:09:11] wizkx: cheese is evil
[1:09:12] bollskis: whats really crazy is how much damage dh did at the start of the season
[1:09:12] randyman26: when did that DH change happen? i thought dh sucked ass
[1:09:12] Suchacrisis: dude they are reachin like pro pally levels remember that shit? He bout won the championship as heals
[1:09:14] squarepusher_: No changes were made to DH when everyone got buffed a month ago.
[1:09:19] R1_Prototype: they can’t gouge or kidney without a weapon. and throwing a rogue off their rotation seems like it makes them panic
[1:09:20] gianni_gsp: @i_Static cdew analysis XD
[1:09:20] Arthyius: cheese bad but aspertine good??
[1:09:21] brandonnnnnnnnnn: The only thing that sucks is if your someone with extremely low metabolism it makes it more difficult and you have to dial in the diet even more.
[1:09:23] Tinmania: What's with Capital One acquiring Discover? I have both cards
[1:09:24] poroyou: unpasterized cheese feels like a bad idea
[1:09:29] GoldieGmoney: they need to make feral dh levels of broken

[1:10:04] JoordyT: Is DH as bad as when rets had their OP moment last season??
[1:10:04] GoSolarASAP: @ShutrMcGavin of course I do. do you know how insulin works? do you know what happens to excess nutrients when you have an insulin spike from corn syrup and dextrose? do you know how it affects your insulin sensitivity when it's sugar versus synthetic sugar? have you ever done real time blood work while drinking a regular soda versus diet soda? believe what you want, but trust me - drinking regular soda is not "better" for you than diet, it is terrible for you. but, believe whatever you want my
[1:10:08] Wottl: there's good cheese
[1:10:10] Wottl: and good milk
[1:10:13] ShutrMcGavin: @GoSolarASAP if you went to college for this shit, you should get your money back

[1:10:47] GoSolarASAP: @ShutrMcGavin it's crazy how you've insulted me twice and I haven't insulted you once.. men versus boys
[1:10:56] Schwantes2: I thought we were supposed to copy the r1's and not think for ourselves
[1:11:00] GoSolarASAP: @poroyou thanks babe
[1:11:01] Wottl: got some lactose intolerant fellas in here?
[1:11:07] ShutrMcGavin: @GoSolarASAP As i said, which apparently you didn't read.  You shouldn't drink sodas.
[1:11:10] Flashhny: David goggins vids every day to get me pumped to go to the gym
[1:11:40] ShutrMcGavin: @GoSolarASAP Thinking synthetic sodas are "free" when it comes to calories is why you see overweight people drinking them by the 12 packs

[1:24:41] trSwacky: does any1 know if the gurubashi arena chest still spawns in retail?
[1:24:58] Teehowdy: sourdough can have many different flours in it, but manly bread flour with hints of wheat or rye
[1:25:04] munchenout: making sourdough is pretty easy you just need patience and a kitchen scale.
[1:25:07] Teehowdy: whatever the artisan may choose
[1:25:57] GoSolarASAP: @munchenout I wanna try but I already got 2 professions.. shit's lame
[1:26:40] DrongoLightning: @Teehowdy bread flour is just wheat flour with additives
[1:26:46] Teehowdy: I wouldnt say its  easy but once you get good, you make two and just give one out as a irl gift
[1:26:56] Teehowdy: and people appreciate that
[1:27:32] Teehowdy: yeah they are close, both high protein flours which is why it works well for bread making

[1:29:55] kingmason90: where’s your house at?
[1:29:56] kriticaldk95: why u eating a sandwich when u got the money to eat sushi everyday
[1:30:05] GoSolarASAP: it's user friendly for sure
[1:30:07] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: Sonos is definitely the best unless you want to go full wired and get high end wired speakers
[1:30:18] kevogasm: @kriticaldk95 Gotta stay humble
[1:30:21] GoSolarASAP: @KhAoTiCFeeLeY yeah this for sure
[1:30:22] matt_caste: They have a lot of different bars. I'd like something that stops me having to change my netflix out of 5.1 every time I watch something because the audio goes to shit over the tv speakers
[1:30:29] Voriq: @kriticaldk95 cus you'll die of mercury
[1:30:32] kriticaldk95: @kevogasm true
[1:30:33] GoSolarASAP: it's expensive af for being wireless though
[1:30:38] kingmason90: norcal 5 percent chance of tornado today
[1:30:38] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: but then you need to wire through the walls and everything a lot more goes into it
[1:31:18] kevogasm: That's a team of all girls!
[1:32:53] matt_caste: Honestly I shouldn't buy shit. They called today and the pup needs an extra surgery for that chest thing yesterday so tacking an extra 1,500 on

[1:33:43] GoSolarASAP: yo why are you on a diff rogue account now, tf
[1:33:46] fearsii: that matress i linked was voted best matress by 6 company and best for side sleeper with back pain

[1:33:53] matt_caste: I mean, I've been asking the normal vet to remove it for 2 years, just had to wait for it to fucking explode like the chest burster in alien
[1:33:59] yani770: I love sleeping during a heavy rain...oof , i'm kind of envious
[1:34:06] lazyturtle0824: @somanie same
[1:34:09] xikronix_: is subtlety viable anymore? debated on coming back. not that I’m great at it but been gone awhile
[1:34:10] toolazy2work: @pikabooirl my gf literally just flew through those storms.  and she has a crazy fear of flying
[1:34:18] matt_caste: @Somanie Appreciate homie, she's on the mend, just a long road
[1:34:20] GoSolarASAP: ah so it's all MMR related, that makes sense
[1:34:37] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: @pikabooirl Sonos is the best soundbar type system and has the benefit of being totally wireless easy to install with awesome technology that allow you to do everything through the Sonos App. You could spend upwards of 2-15k on a full wired system that’s high end but you’ll have a way more complex install and wires will need to be ran through the walls etc. but the end result can be insane
[1:34:53] matt_caste: You had a trip today?
[1:35:12] vanity_tm: pika you should really update your bio it says you use geforce gtx 770 :D
[1:35:13] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: Sonos is GOATed for sure
[1:35:14] matt_caste: Levi visit at the airport? nice

[1:35:25] matt_caste: Fly brad in to wire your house, that's what he does
[1:35:35] aelysqt: vouch for sonos theres def better quality if you go for a full setup but sonos is super easy to install
[1:35:37] kevogasm: Train druid
[1:35:46] DINGODOGGERDUDE: pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove
[1:35:51] matt_caste: he'll build you a full outdoor sound system for the yard, get your house all rigged up, and he'll probably do it for a handy
[1:35:53] Teehowdy: anyone come across delay in sound from bluetoothe though?
[1:35:59] randyman26: wireless is OP, wired in home systems are too much
[1:36:18] randyman26: unless youre using it for professional work
[1:36:23] bigchurchman: @matt_caste for that id do it
[1:36:23] Teehowdy: my excercise earbuds use to have delay, granted they are small and im sure they tech is limited due to spacial constraints
[1:36:30] randyman26: just my opinion
[1:36:35] aelysqt: most people will be happy with a sonos setup
[1:36:40] matt_caste: @matt_caste I'll be in touch...
[1:36:47] GoSolarASAP: @randyman26 some people like home cinema sound lol
[1:37:05] randyman26: i love good audio lol. no argument from me
[1:37:10] GoSolarASAP: I don't think he is tho, so yeah sonos is clutch

[1:38:14] randyman26: i just install the shit for a living and it seems like its more work than its worth a lot of the time. thats all

[1:40:00] Teehowdy: @randyman26 can you install saunas
[1:40:06] ralvich: also they wanted to balance the game around 3v3

[2:53:40] Johnykarate: tesla are known to have a cheap interior i dont know personally tho
[2:53:44] anniefan1337: https://vossenwheels.com/wheel/hf-7/
[2:53:53] dashboarddaily: @Reaperz_kinetic Umm not safe at all, you dont get to hear the engine, the batteries are shitty and last a month
[2:53:53] anniefan1337: those are the wheels I bought
[2:54:10] Ralph1670: !playlist

[2:54:47] atorob: idk i know a few ppl with tesla's that love them, never see them having many issues
[2:54:55] Explicit_TKO: @anniefan1337 great choice
[2:55:03] Bloodw0lf1: Tesla's aren't road trip vehicles lol
[2:55:04] srrymyfingerslip: ppl who don’t know shit about teslas other than what the internet tells them giving their opinions to Tesla owners lol
[2:55:11] Bloodw0lf1: Not many issues for a daily driver
[2:55:14] notoriousztv: congrats on glad

[2:55:48] Johnykarate: huge improvement for sure looks like a new car
[2:55:52] Anjen: did  you say your left boob?
[2:55:52] Reaperz_kinetic: @dashboarddaily sooo actually theyre the highest rated car for safety sooo already wrong, the not getting to hear the engine is just a by product of it being electric and an opinion so doesnt mean the car is "bad", the batteries arent shit people just dont realize they need to take care of them, the road trips point is a very good point i wont even cap but gas powered cars were the same when they were new too
[2:55:56] anniefan1337: I spent weeks researching the right wheels
[2:55:57] Reaperz_kinetic: damn that was long my b chat
