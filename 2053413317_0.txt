[1:28:41] zachl_: @MATinMeteCaBRA u can either treeform 1 set of 2 fires or if u running convoke u can rotate flourish and convoke
[1:28:55] zachl_: u can also rotate both ur barks for both fire mechs and they line up every time

[3:45:36] anaya909: @ReSeT_VT that's insane, but i respect it.  not everybody hated them
[3:45:44] baseboned: spires being the worst is the most obvious SL take

[3:46:38] xxChef: What’s everyone’s favorite DF dungeon
[3:46:43] Bannakis_: I have nostalgia for Freehold because I started S4 BFA and was a BM Hunter so the dungeon was just lots of AoE and no mechanics for me
[3:46:45] baseboned: Algathar
[3:46:47] Thoreya: azure vault
[3:46:48] baseboned: is my fave
[3:46:50] Thoreya: or algathar
[3:46:56] Satimy: Uldaman good?

[3:47:22] tonybony614: azure is terrible
[3:47:23] Thoreya: he has to be trolling
[3:47:30] Bannakis_: If they removed the roof on Uldaman so I could have real camera angles I'd like the dungeon more
[3:47:33] xxChef: AA>Nokhud>Brackenhide
[3:47:39] baseboned: the change to Azure Vault is terrbile for real tho
[3:47:45] anaya909: @Bannakis_ that's me in almost every dungeon this season
[3:47:49] Thoreya: yeah uldaman brackenhide and nokhud ICANT
[3:48:04] naieisawful: bring boralus back!
[3:48:06] Satimy: Nokhud for the warrior Meta
[3:48:09] Thoreya: and infusion ICANT
[3:48:10] tonybony614: @xxChef I enjoyed Nokhud but the tornado boss beat my cheeks so bad early on that I have ptsd every time I go there
[3:48:20] ReSeT_VT: Chat, should they remove roofs from all  content?
[3:48:29] tonybony614: YES
[3:48:30] Silencbank: i think nokhud will be much better without thundering and with better dragon riding
[3:48:35] anaya909: roof removal would make the game 800x better
[3:48:35] naieisawful: @ReSeT_VT whats a roof?
[3:48:44] xxChef: @tonybony614 yeah the bosses in general aren’t easy. fun trash pulls tho
[3:48:50] Bannakis_: Nokhud was a reasonable dungeon, I just personally didn't like the down time flying from area to area, but I guess that travel time seems to have become more of a norm recently
[3:49:13] baseboned: I wont go so far as saying no roof ever, but I'd be willing to compromise a lot of aesthetic for better cameras
[3:49:14] ReSeT_VT: A roof is That thing where your camera gets stuck on and you can't play at your usual camera angle
[3:49:14] anaya909: even everbloom has all kinds of trees and bullshit serving no purpose but to block cam
[3:49:20] nightbreeze93: i didn't mind nokhud but it's amazing how they made that one of the most linear dungeons
[3:49:23] naieisawful: @ReSeT_VT OOOH
[3:49:27] naieisawful: those roofs
[3:49:36] Hawkism2: the "probably" call out goes hard lmfao

[3:52:29] Satimy: Is it TMSean Sundays
[3:52:37] zachl_: i love brandawgleston but man are his dungeon takes cooked
[3:52:38] corsair1995: kings rest
[3:53:01] Bannakis_: I just want them to embrace the Halls meme, just a season of every Halls dungeon ever created.
[3:53:08] anaya909: all i remember of kings rest is pre nerf spit gold
[3:53:12] IAmSolari: @Satimy  starechamp
[3:53:18] anaya909: when they cut the dmg by 75% because it was that op
[3:53:21] nightbreeze93: some men just have strange tastes

[5:51:44] baseboned: disc was my first healer in modern wow, not sure if that was ideal in hindsight, but shrug,
[5:51:58] zachl_: holy is a good not only first healer but a good way to like get in the groove imo
[5:52:06] zachl_: disc has a very unique playstyle
[5:52:19] baseboned: I feel like TE is an advanced disc talent, I wouldn't worry about it too much
[5:52:58] baseboned: I feel like the holy word stuff in holy priest is way more complicated than resto shaman, I feel like resto shaman is the more basic healer by far
[5:53:21] kabong200: Ive been resto druid this season and love it. Usually pretty chill
[5:53:23] baseboned: not that holy is super complicated
[5:53:54] whiskeyhide: HOLY
[5:54:02] GrowlFan420: @dorki
[5:54:07] baseboned: I just think shaman is super straight forward, especially in SL when healing surge span plus riptide was so strong
[5:54:20] Meteox: !civcheck

[5:54:39] roguerhino: dorki just ran an 11:01 EB for time trials noice
[5:54:52] HarveyPls: i think holy can be overwhelming to noobs for sure in like an m+ setting maybe im high
[5:55:20] HarveyPls: when ur whole team starts dying at the same time and u dont have an immediate answer u can panic if ur not used to it
[5:55:20] roguerhino: only 45 secs of 1st place time for the EB
[5:55:34] Meteox: re sto druid is the best healer. Why? You got access to meow form.

[7:30:51] TBouse: oof that's a lot of damage lost
[7:30:58] nightbreeze93: these last 2 bosses are hard
[7:30:59] GrimFandango: @Surefirexp this is the best key... just not on Bursting week
[7:31:04] n0s0upbr0: brother the Aug died

[7:32:42] baseboned: fire mage
[7:32:48] n0s0upbr0: oh
[7:32:55] stagnate92: is it just me or does mw look like what hpal was supposed to be
[7:32:56] mathrix__: Is pretz a buyer?
[7:32:57] n0s0upbr0: VRKTHER DIED AS A FIRE MAGE
[7:33:18] Oxycleanse: look at the details it also says classes?
[7:33:30] baseboned: nooooooooooooo Cryge
[7:33:35] JackOfAllApocalypses: 8(
[7:33:35] nightbreeze93: Despairge
[7:33:35] n0s0upbr0: wtf man
[7:33:37] GrimFandango: you tried Sadge
[7:33:37] Xepros: Why arent the dps soaking the flowers
[7:33:49] silmarilen: because they have to kill the add
[7:33:52] Shimorta: theyre trying to kill add
[7:33:54] Surefirexp: boss damage
[7:34:03] baseboned: and one was deadge
[7:34:04] nightbreeze93: that boss is some shit
[7:34:08] JustEclecticV1: @stagnate92 facts
[7:34:12] n0s0upbr0: damn man
[7:34:18] Razdruid: 450k ticks wow
[7:34:22] TBouse: does fire mage have to turret or can they move while dpsing
[7:34:29] Oxycleanse: when’s the pally powa coming out?
[7:34:30] Surefirexp: looking forward to this key being gone
[7:34:31] GrimFandango: @TBouse can move in combust
[7:34:35] khebul: tyrannical is a harsh mistress
[7:34:50] Surefirexp: I honestly enjoyed SL dungeons so bring them back
[7:34:55] yellingaboutsports1: gf dude. ugh sucks
[7:34:59] yellingaboutsports1: *gg
[7:35:02] Shimorta: this dungeon on tyran feels like the hardest one, fuck that boss man
[7:35:35] nightbreeze93: prodigy put up a fight
[7:35:38] GrimFandango: How would one live Yalnu above +29 without Aug? This seems like an aug required key
[7:35:46] Xepros: Growl do u think this season is fun for healing? Or do you find yourself having to pick the comp depending on what classes get oneshot or not?
[7:35:58] khebul: both sol and yalnu are MonkaSteer
[7:36:07] Shimorta: @GrimFandango just have 3 dps that are unkillable, mage rogue pally
[7:36:35] spicykekw: from a pug perspective i think is awful
[7:36:39] nightbreeze93: nobody has done a 30 tyran everbloom
[7:36:45] spicykekw: and frustating if u dont play the right class to not be one shotted
[7:36:57] n0s0upbr0: sorry yumy
[7:37:00] n0s0upbr0: love u
[7:37:26] Bansherz: the hawk guest appearance
[7:37:35] n0s0upbr0: Banshers is GOD
[7:37:56] n0s0upbr0: BANSHERS > azortharion NOT EVEN CLOSE
[7:37:57] khebul: How is the monk compared to other healers for high tyran?
[7:38:11] n0s0upbr0: Banshers wouldn’t die
[7:38:15] n0s0upbr0: live fucking lord
[7:38:56] GrimFandango: that Thunder Tea -> Expel Harm change was sooo nice
[7:39:00] Noisillex: is rsham bad in the higher keys?
[7:39:01] Ventorpoe: i think chiji is insane if you let ur group know when ur pressing it
[7:39:10] Ventorpoe: i wouldnt live a lot of stuff if i didnt have that
[7:39:13] TBouse: mw seems to have slightly better healing profile but less damage
[7:39:19] Ventorpoe: its big enough
[7:39:35] Shimorta: @Noisillex yes
[7:39:59] n0s0upbr0: vent hunter > Banshers ???
[7:40:01] jersynessss: chi-ji combined with enveloping mist is the go to
[7:40:07] jersynessss: especially when aoe hits
[7:40:09] n0s0upbr0: maybe ???
[7:40:13] raechu_: Chi Ji shield is about as big as Rally or Mass Barrier
[7:40:28] nepojoel: bring back the spot heals on hpal
[7:40:29] n0s0upbr0: listen yumy gives his best effort always
[7:40:34] JustEclecticV1: hows pally nowadays
[7:40:50] TBouse: the pretzul legend dying right after saying he doesnt need help
[7:40:52] Galois_rg: "if I play correctly" is a big if lol
[7:41:01] n0s0upbr0: @ventorpoe love you
[7:41:09] zeni_sama: zeni_sama subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[7:41:32] HarveyPls: did you ever use the new tea+expel combo? feels almost useless
[7:41:39] khebul: 180k is about as big as mass barrier, no?
[7:42:00] Ventorpoe: @khebul yes, just about
[7:42:05] SneakyPauly: mass like 220-230 or something yeah
[7:42:06] Ventorpoe: and chiji is 1m
[7:42:11] julian_fmv: do u ever use it with rsk?
[7:42:17] julian_fmv: i mean tea + rising sun
[7:42:21] Ventorpoe: like soulrend is every 30s on yazma, which means u get it every other
[7:42:23] Ventorpoe: its huge
[7:43:39] jersynessss: do you have leaf, maybe that helps?
[7:43:56] Chewbaccaw: bro im living in black rook hold for a weapon
[7:44:30] gigawatersoaker7777: Idk if it's just me but feels like dps getting hit by the jadefire stomp can be all the difference
[7:44:46] raechu_: MW is higher hps than druid though right?
[7:44:50] julian_fmv: I was feeling that way before using leaf and i got used to it, but both trinkets are good calls
[7:45:07] prugar: 29 EB well definitely warm something up for you guys
[7:45:11] TBouse: rdruid definitely more dps
[7:45:13] prugar: will*
[7:45:26] TBouse: certainly on prio damage
[7:46:07] khebul: Playing ith hunter, and today we tried 29 atal. Feels like there is severe imbalance in class survivability at this level
[7:46:22] cptjohnnnn: can u do more keys with max
[7:46:59] cptjohnnnn: its so fun watching those i just finished watching them on youtube
[7:47:19] raechu_: @yumytv have you thought about letting all the little adds spawn on yalnu so you can sck for a million hps through the add phase?
[7:47:36] totesnotbore: big io tonight?
[7:47:55] cptjohnnnn: wow 29 EB sounds rough
[7:47:55] totesnotbore: we got it today im never going back
[7:47:59] noldan216: live pug terrorism sounds fun, I'd watch the Growldh
[7:48:04] julian_fmv: EB truly feels like the hardest dungeons of the season after rise nerfs
[7:48:07] totesnotbore: i will drop my key to a +2 if i had to prove my point
[7:48:18] Chrissingr: then you get to do 30 :)
[7:48:24] GrimFandango: I hope they remove depletes next xpac, I'd love to see you guys just slam into +29s on repeat until you get it
[7:48:29] TBouse: the nice part about tyran is you know when you are done pushing a key level lol
[7:48:32] cptjohnnnn: did they nerf bursting?
[7:48:35] Arisolo: I’m surprised how much faster echo is this time trials. I thought dorki would make it super close
[7:48:37] totesnotbore: @TBouse 100%
[7:49:05] cptjohnnnn: yeah this week feels a lot better than a few weeks ago
[7:49:07] nahrniarcg: plus some classes are more tanky against bursting
[7:49:11] GrimFandango: @Arisolo Dorki's team has like 2ish days less practice because of TR issues, they'll catch up
[7:49:12] nahrniarcg: a resto druid is basically immune to bursting
[7:49:31] Arisolo: @grimfandango doesn’t it close tonight
[7:49:38] khebul: Member when blizzard said they want to healers to not top everyone off in 1 global?
[7:49:38] ritsrawr: @yumytv WHATS YOUR RANK RN ON THE MONK?
[7:49:39] GrimFandango: ooo... shit
[7:49:43] ritsrawr: mb capsd
[7:50:22] peaceffrog: What's the addon that brings up that circular item menu?
[7:50:32] MrBulborb: wait why are rdruids not affected by bursting
[7:50:35] MrBulborb: just the massive hots?
[7:50:38] Ultratoasted: Pog
[7:50:41] SkewterTheTooter: @peaceffrog OPie
[7:50:53] peaceffrog: Thanks
[7:51:02] Arisolo: 10:14 bloom
[7:51:02] nahrniarcg: @MrBulborb ye rdruid can heal 25+ bursting stacks, and also druid as the spec itself is super tanky against bursting
[7:51:09] Arisolo: 15:40 rise
[7:51:33] HarveyPls: Deadge
[7:51:38] TBouse: what are we looking at here
[7:51:43] HarveyPls: death
[7:51:45] MrBulborb: @nahrniarcg Is it a tie between them and mist or?
[7:51:46] cptjohnnnn: 29 WCM seems like aids
[7:52:09] TBouse: you can run by the essence lol
[7:52:40] nahrniarcg: @MrBulborb if u mean purely bursting druid is 100% better with it
[7:53:34] GrimFandango: RSham is better at bursting than MW, IMO
[7:53:46] GrimFandango: They're just worse at literally everything else relevant to surviving high keys
[7:54:52] MrBulborb: I thought on demand bear for huge hits is a guarantee survival and the vers buff would make them better
[7:54:55] TBouse: healing paladins reminds me of healing bdk sometimes
[7:57:59] TBouse: LUL
[7:58:02] Meteox: Deadge

[8:27:30] khebul: Push weeks should not be a thing, make every week push week
[8:27:50] Chewbaccaw: every weeks a push week
[8:27:51] JPAzS71121: What are decently flexible talent points for Disc in the class tree for phantasm?
[8:27:55] Chewbaccaw: cuz i be constipated
[8:28:28] baseboned: words of the pious

[8:29:42] baseboned: the dot damage mana gen one if you have points there
[8:29:59] Galois_rg: @yumytv I see you expressed some pro-animal murder sentiment in squish's cord, big mistake
[8:30:12] Ponzie: @vellocets What happened?
[8:30:41] Galois_rg: it's black and white, you're literally hitler in squish's mind now
[8:30:44] Chewbaccaw: this guy has opinions
[8:31:05] Galois_rg: I think 50% of the things they say are satire
[8:32:00] Essenix: this whole album is a banger
[8:32:03] Svesno: Are we able to get healing meter for trio?
[8:32:04] GoodyGodfather: song name?

[8:33:28] noldan216: I appreciate the overly aggressive usage of the whammy bar
[8:33:57] xxjameskingxx71: i feel like blizz is going to nerf shal gift ability on MW
[8:34:05] AnnaXOXD: catsittingverycumfortablearoundacampfirewithitsfriends
[8:34:07] TBouse: pretzul press a defensive
[8:34:38] itswowza: Any way to see the healing done on the bosses?
[8:34:40] khebul: @vellocets wouldn't be a surprise. Many guilds bash their heads against tindral and fyrakk. Pre last nerf tindral is too hard of a boss for an average mythic guild imo
[8:34:54] Chewbaccaw: cumfortable HUHH
[8:35:04] Essenix: itswowza bottom right details
[8:36:07] Ponzie: @khebul true. plus that raid team was a bit ragey tbh
[8:36:44] raminalamouti: !addons

[8:38:23] TBouse: timer is looking very good
[8:38:28] Akrylikzz: !song
[8:38:29] Nightbot: I don't have current song/mix setup but here is my spotify playlist https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2hEHzs3cEKVbxB9duyqByp?si=c54b103cd6214c6c | more music: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRTKWg18bBrGMaOoQq604614em6WpaYy0
[8:39:25] JPAzS71121: How are they managing to make these pulls not miserable w/ bursting stacks? All the little crap dies if you breathe on it
[8:39:58] khebul: @JPAzS71121 on 28 even smallies are quite tanky
[8:40:07] ottomr1990: MD + renewal + not being monkeys
[8:40:25] jessebona: @JPAzS71121 Shadow Priest for mass dispel and Monk for for Revive?, both cleanse of all stacks in one hit.
[8:40:28] ottomr1990: revival**
[8:40:48] JPAzS71121: I mean MD is 2 min and Revival is what, 3?
[8:41:24] TBouse: pretzul LOL
[8:41:26] hellheater: less than 3 with talent
[8:41:28] jessebona: @JPAzS71121 I'd imagine they stagger the big pulls between the cds being up for each.
[8:41:39] julian_fmv: omg healing this is so stressful lol
[8:41:44] YuzukiKaze: CHILLEN
[8:42:04] ottomr1990: yeah but even up to like 7 stacks monk healing has no issue getting through it, so most of the normal dreadpetal pulls won't require anything
[8:42:14] JPAzS71121: @julian_fmv I personally love healing this boss, but I'm only a weekly key gamer
[8:42:43] JPAzS71121: In a key this high, I'd imagine it's sweating bullets the whole time
[8:43:00] TBouse: uh oh
[8:43:06] TBouse: i think they die
[8:43:29] TBouse: you cant live with 1 person dead unless you use like everything
[8:43:38] HarveyPls: i think today everbloom won
[8:43:38] baseboned: Deadge
[8:43:39] xxjameskingxx71: sadge
[8:43:45] khebul: Sol does not mess around
[8:44:02] hellheater: classic EB
[8:44:09] hellheater: Sadge
[8:44:17] afkpoopn: Sol is our dad
[8:44:19] TBouse: arent the first two deaths just big misplays
[8:44:29] afkpoopn: beatin up on his kids at driveway basketball
[8:44:31] khebul: EB is tough cos you have two back to back bosses who are giga deadly
[8:44:42] Heapsofjoy: 0.4s between 2 ticks how to live D:
[8:44:57] JPAzS71121: Sol is such a sick boss. I'd bet it'd be awesome as a raid boss w/ some changes
[8:45:43] Nex_Healer: What the do you want to release WA?
[8:46:07] Nex_Healer: Thanks
[8:46:45] Linith_Heart: i would like it if they changed it so it does actual AoE instead of random targets. losing to rng is cringe
[8:48:04] c3rby_: Nah i just got here, you got like 3 hours added on
[8:48:04] hivplus__: GeoTime
[8:48:06] d3rftree: i just finished my math midterm, it only took me 6hrs
[8:48:11] JakobLowrizzle: love a good key sesh with a group
[8:48:17] baseboned: GeoTime
[8:48:30] gartsky: bro i've been spamming trying to get into groups for 1hr + and still cant get into shit
[8:48:39] baseboned: but you aren't just chatting
[8:48:51] baseboned: are yea we wow players HATE nerds
[8:48:55] Hyvest: We suck YEP
