[2:45:01] dyslexican1: HArd more will be about as hard as Heroic. Which isnt that hard. I love Wrath but it was "hard" compared to current raids.
[2:45:11] Todmeister9000: are we getting cata classic?
[2:45:17] Aquadriel: i quit TBC week one cause lvling speed was misserable
[2:45:21] dyslexican1: wasn't*

[2:45:53] Tambandia: The launches are the best part
[2:45:55] mmrghost7: the fact that they did arthas that dirty on SLs makes not wanna play wrath
[2:45:56] swordart2022: @tulladarthekids pay for boost
[2:46:04] boopbopbamski: ya it will be  a waiting room for a lot of retail gamers

[2:50:23] ObliqueTV: @TulladarTheKids In a way it is as you are constantly leveling up rep/gear etc. I played since release and quit in BFA :) No need to be toxic homie just stating an opinion

[2:51:25] ObliqueTV: @TulladarTheKids Nobody is salty here besides you it would seem, its just an interesting opinion my dude. Hope you still have fun playing though, thats all that really matters.
[2:51:30] swordart2022: @tulladarthekids nah just saying truth don't like quit bye.
[2:51:37] mrpresbaby: why haven't they nerfed soul collection yet? I hate having to go collect souls at this point on alts
[2:51:48] N3llee: not a lot of class/ability changes so not a lot of people playing this league
[2:51:56] swordart2022: @mrpresbaby should be account wide
[2:52:10] Sollice: @swordart2022 Your becoming a bit much in chat right now. Calm down. You dont need to pick fights with everyone
[2:52:27] mrpresbaby: @swordart2022 yeah
[2:52:44] swordart2022: @tulladarthekids bye, @solice okay gonna block them
[2:53:06] Sollice: Sounds best just block people you dont want to argue with
[2:53:10] ghost186_: Other than maybe a few bosses, such as Lich King himself, Wrath was easier than TBC imo
[2:53:14] swordart2022: Pog
[2:53:21] swordart2022: KEKW
[2:53:23] raldrik: you shove that up and twist

[2:54:27] Jarlan23: it'll be the hardest part of the entire game because every server is lop sided lol
[2:54:28] ghost186_: Yea that shit was broken
[2:54:31] Bayne77: wrath = massive tank pull, aoe down
[2:54:32] mmrghost7: was wrath horde populated ?
[2:54:38] swordart2022: I hear all sweat Lords swap to Human because of racial
[2:54:43] Armdel: they'll win... on that one server with like 90/10 alliance/horde split
[2:54:50] Colt_Engineer: what faction imbalance? no way KEKW

[2:55:12] WOOPsWOOP: Thank god as TBC is boring, the raids are too gated for me, can't get into them and don't have time for guilds
[2:55:26] ruhroraggy: i miss 10 man
[2:55:32] mavericks312: wow wouldnt have lasted with the TBC model this long
[2:55:38] ObsidianHealer: nagU Arthas?
[2:55:38] Colt_Engineer: sorry who?
[2:55:47] ChristianTX: casual - im interested
[2:55:48] callmestray: how much rep do you get for raid bosses in LFR?  I need to hit exalted
[2:55:59] TheKitsuneAdventures: arthas the lichking  or  arthas the spark that  fades away
[2:56:02] Sylphy_TV: Whoo? What sword... jees
[2:56:02] McconnelI: uwu
[2:56:14] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee who is arthas? lol
[2:56:17] xINFERNOx69: why would we want it more casual :(?
[2:56:19] Bayne77: this Arfist person, were they are strong and cool as the jailer?
[2:56:30] nvnto: @Towelliee gonna buy the rune?
[2:56:33] ruhroraggy: 10 man raiding so much easier to manage
[2:56:35] Colt_Engineer: lihuvem on heroic is no joke
[2:56:50] Armdel: @bayne77 jailor was his boss, so probably not
[2:57:04] xINFERNOx69: you want it to be easy?
[2:57:11] Jarlan23: how much are regular runes on ur server
[2:57:15] mavericks312: casuals carry the game not the hardcore players
[2:57:25] wowking35: towHype towHype towHype
[2:57:28] PvtHudson093: easy and fun
[2:57:50] Colt_Engineer: wrath was like my girlfriend at the time, easy and casual
[2:57:57] STILLSAD2: I think it's better if players are having fun with it, and to most that means casual.
[2:58:00] ghost186_: More interesting than hard imo. Final few bosses shouldnt be overly easy
[2:58:04] xINFERNOx69: yeah as long as there is easy and hard not just easy, if its just easy its kinda boring right?
[2:58:52] N3llee: 25 naxx will be cleared first day after the first 25 people hit 70
[2:58:52] mmrghost7: a day
[2:59:03] ghost186_: Solarian
[2:59:04] mavericks312: malygos and sarth will be dead in about 30 minutes

[2:59:16] swordart2022: As far I know
[2:59:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: no
[2:59:21] j3pp3tt0: I dont think so
[2:59:25] xINFERNOx69: dont think so but you never want a game to be just casual
[2:59:30] JQ47: less then 6 hoursn
[2:59:31] ghost186_: BT is Easiest though
[2:59:36] zysmos: they all got oneshoted
[2:59:37] mmrghost7: there are so many ppl that have played wrath in private servers they will eat the raid in one day
[2:59:45] Rottencoarse: bt was first day
[2:59:51] ObsidianHealer: It really was
[2:59:58] CloudPants8081: so console release inc? Kappa
[3:00:06] swordart2022: @xinfernox69 Then you play Shadowlands and so what you enjoy. no one plays classic for challenge
[3:00:07] emznev: why did you stop playing tbc?? @Towelliee
[3:00:08] mavericks312: wrath was the casualization of WoW
[3:00:09] kappaday23: Kappa
[3:00:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: having dumb players is what makes classic hard now
[3:00:16] shores_g: What do you define as casual in this case?
[3:00:22] duffluv22: A yo jimmy!!!!
[3:00:23] ghost186_: Solarian, Lich king and Yogg ) nly difficult bosses in its entirety
[3:00:28] xINFERNOx69: wait wait i am not saing nots not casual but you said before people in 2022 want game to be casual, thats not true
[3:00:28] swordart2022: @haxzorjimduggan KEKW
[3:00:42] MagicMonte: Do you think they'll keep limited attempts for bosses like they had in ICC?
[3:00:52] Kisswani: wrath is when I started using Keybinds instead of clicking , that's pretty hardcore Kappa
[3:00:56] vic_ave: some of you are argueing just to argue
[3:01:13] Colt_Engineer: @VicAva12 No I'm not
[3:01:16] Bayne77: RIP Wildstar
[3:01:23] CYNIC308: im late but idk if people know this but POE has a skill called Vampiric Link which basically turns you into a DiscPriest and links your life to the tank for any group play through @Towelliee
[3:01:36] Etsku: who wants an hardcore mmo except people who dont have jobs
[3:01:36] mavericks312: players dont wanna spend more then 30 minutes playing an mmo just look at ZM for example
[3:01:37] duffluv22: We just don't have the time anymore
[3:01:40] Voopee: Most people have a job and family, tring to inc a mmo inside of that can be hard enough
[3:01:45] c0mmander_starscream: Game is DOA
[3:01:45] notColt45: Hardcore mobile MMO maybe COPIUM
[3:01:51] chadadin: wildstar tried that, t hey flunked
[3:01:52] callmestray: Look at Mortal Online 2  sadge
[3:01:52] c0mmander_starscream: Game Over Man
[3:01:56] stratiss: wildstar sadge
[3:02:01] TheNoidd: if a game doesnt have challenging content in it i have no desire to play it
[3:02:02] ClassicMalcontent: Nearly no players have or want to invest the time it takes for traditional old school MMORPGs. Myself included, want to do more than just play a game all day.
[3:02:02] Durk101: Letting players have fun and enjoy a game is always for the better for everyone
[3:02:03] raldrik: New world tried and had to redo their entire game which caused it to be shit and died
[3:02:04] TeejayOCE: Yep, i dont play wow for mythic + or raiding what so ever anymore, just casually mount grind and do daily content
[3:02:07] xINFERNOx69: at the end of the day having a challenge with in any game is what is rewarding yeah?

[3:02:25] ghost186_: True
[3:02:26] Etsku: @chadadin so sad it didnt go well
[3:02:28] dyslexican1: I feel like that is true for any game. if you only cater to a small % of the population then you will only get a small % of the population that has any interest in it. whichis a bad investment.
[3:02:31] dannyis1337: the game is casual when everyone defends addons
[3:02:32] akia03: @Towelliee  you have any vault tokens laying around?
[3:02:32] chadadin: @Etsku me too but it catered too hard to hardcores
[3:02:34] fistofnature: sad but true
[3:02:35] Bayne77: most people want games to be casual so they can play for fun.  but you should always include harder tiers of content for those who want the challenge

[3:03:04] PresidentPepr: just finding time to play wow with a full life schedule is a challenge
[3:03:04] ClassicMalcontent: Games should be easy with optional content with higher difficulties from Heroics to Mythics and M+ and so on. And it should be that way.
[3:03:04] CloudPants8081: just wear a tabard for rep Kappa

[3:05:53] OGXanos: more Pocopoc system stuff
[3:05:54] Vendralos: @swordart2022 Bye :)
[3:05:56] OldPotatoJoey: accurate, especially with MMOs, as they age, to keep their grown base they have to cater to the more casual player because kids grow up to be adults and have adult responsibilities that don't allow for 6 hours a day to play typically.
[3:05:58] raye_gaming22: @Broomba this, casual dogos dont even know waht they want and they are in fault for the state wow is now
[3:06:08] Gargantix: they put a ton more people into the world building team to do just that though didn't they?
[3:06:10] Kisswani: give me protoform synthesis with faster genesis mote acquisition and I'll play every second of every day
[3:06:11] RagingPunk: lots of world events would be cool :)
[3:06:11] OGXanos: I thought I'd hate pocopoc but it's kinda fun, bit of a grind tho
[3:06:14] Molvonos: Pocopoc is bae
[3:06:16] xandux: more mr popo potion patrol
[3:06:18] Thoreya: shouldve done a dragon themed mage tower
[3:06:23] Thoreya: wouldve been a hot

[3:06:44] Myndjestyr: remember how good shadowlands sounded before release......
[3:06:47] Etsku: i miss legion so much Sadge
[3:06:49] CYNIC308: a fully fleshed out Torghast? LUL
[3:06:51] EscapePlan01: cant torghast be that?
[3:06:57] ClassicMalcontent: Nah. No thanks.
[3:07:06] Kisswani: Yeah but mage tower that gets easier with gear , that makes people not give up on it
[3:07:09] ClassicMalcontent: No more borrowed power. Need time away from the game.
[3:07:10] Dyriks: I keep saying Coco pops instead of Pocopoc
[3:07:13] raye_gaming22: agree put in mage tower every pacth with new bosses and mog but no ap girnd bs we had in bfa
[3:07:19] ClassicMalcontent: I like finishing something and moving on.
[3:07:19] Dyriks: LUL
[3:07:24] Etsku: i dont think they will make a expac like legion in a hwhile
[3:07:36] CYNIC308: @Dyriks i call it that too!
[3:07:41] stin_dips: I hate that spider
[3:08:00] Kisswani: this spider is harder than many normal bosses LUL
[3:08:09] Etsku: even the legendary fishing pole in legion AMAZING
[3:08:09] Dyriks: @cynic308 :D
[3:08:15] mavericks312: but this is what players wanted less stuff to do so less time on the game
[3:08:28] duffluv22: Needs to look scarier
[3:08:40] CYNIC308: imagine Torghast that is actually endless and gets harder and harder the deeper you go? the Torghast we were promised not a time gated boring daily
[3:08:44] wolvenhunt: contract then do 3 wqs
[3:09:21] CloudPants8081: you tried wow with a controller? is supported for a while right?

[3:13:04] Zippaya: I love leveling progress, wouldn't mind if it taese like 10-15 days to go max level at start of xpac
[3:13:05] Kisswani: world quest 3.0 ? Kappa

[3:13:47] mavericks312: id love the return of outdoor dungeons
[3:13:49] CloudPants8081: fishing? Kappa
[3:13:52] Kisswani: @Towelliee if they sort of tie it to dragon flying that could be cool , like races and shit
[3:13:59] CYNIC308: current world quests would be good if there were no flying and no addons ... which is why they restricted flying as default
[3:14:01] Aquadriel: but shadowlands had a lot of outdoor content, problem is that it was 1) not fun 2) the fun needed tons of anima to unlock
[3:14:06] cohesity: i also think having alot of zone that are dark while people where in locked down played a part as well
[3:14:07] Vendralos: I agree, Gw2 world content is great
[3:14:13] raldrik: I think the worst part about SL world quests is that we never had flying in the zone with the relevant WQ. Traveling the world sucked. That should be fixed in DF.
[3:14:17] xINFERNOx69: lol
[3:14:26] mavericks312: fast and the furious warcraft edition lol
[3:14:27] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:14:31] rohdey: check for feasting
[3:14:33] ClockworkZen: IMO, WQs failed in Shadowlands because they primarily offered Anima as a reward and all of the anima rewards are almost prohibitively expensive unless you're doing daily world quests.
[3:14:38] justnthyme: kekw out-designed
[3:14:39] bakurathewolf: 3 KEKW

[3:15:28] rsimpson105: I am chillin man
[3:15:33] Aidler: will we see the cloud dragons of mop in dragonflight again?
[3:15:33] Kisswani: @ClockworkZen yeah it felt like anima needed a sort of catch up kinda like AP had . and now that I have enough anima for the upgrades I just cba coz of souls
[3:15:39] Colt_Engineer: not only that world quest took longer to do this xpac
[3:15:43] JustAwaay: quests were also more annoying
[3:15:50] PvtHudson093: i liked BFA WQ, kill a mob done
[3:15:54] Colt_Engineer: legion you had kill 1 rare world quests
[3:15:56] Putcride: @Towelliee If i remember correctly  in tbc the netherwing had dragon racing
[3:16:00] Aquadriel: Anima was fine as a reward, problem was that WQs took 10 mins to complete only for 35 anima @Towelliee
[3:16:12] Kisswani: @Aidler I think they mentioned that they are more serpents than dragons . not sure tho
[3:16:15] vic_ave: @Towelliee  i hope they bring back the Pvp Quest from Legion those were fun
[3:16:17] DeeterDo: the actual gear from WQs in SL were so terrible
[3:16:24] CYNIC308: yea i think they saw that people liked artifacts n legendaries and just "went full retard" on those mechanics for 6 years now
[3:16:40] Aidler: @kisswani interesting…. thanks
[3:16:42] Bayne77: i stopped wq bcause instead of kill 15 and your done, it was kill 15 of these, now go over there, now kill 3 of these, now talk to this guy, now kill this person
[3:16:51] CYNIC308: gg ez

[3:16:53] Thoreya: i did so many emissaries in  bfa
[3:16:58] Poriand: warcraft arclight rumble seems kinda silent now :/

[5:54:02] mustiparta: 3k is the max now but 1800 for max combat effectiveness
[5:54:03] crowe6485: like artifact power for weapons but account wide?

[5:55:39] DragonofWolves: God of War might get delayed too people are thinking. Gives me enough time to try and find a PS5 somewhere
[5:56:24] tamer_bayne: is toweliee playing eso ?

[5:57:18] CrunkyBrewster: it's improved a lot over the years
[5:57:29] tamer_bayne: i did too @JagrZero  but i played on console
[5:57:33] CrunkyBrewster: meh food
[5:57:33] mustiparta: yeah it was an absolute mess at the beginning, its in a pretty great spot these days tho imo
[5:57:37] kokochris: @JagrZero it was. I was also in the beta.  Honestly it came a long way, its pretty good

[5:58:31] D0m1N_tV: @towelliee gold stars are passives dont need to drag them and blue, red and green stars need to be sloted in chempion points
[5:58:41] Shrenko: but you have 77k crowns so shouldnt be a problem honestly
[5:58:59] CrunkyBrewster: I dont think you can move the chat window without the pchat addon, correct?
[5:59:10] Jaxerath: i hope combat feels less... weightless?
[5:59:35] kokochris: @Jaxerath that was my same feeling, I would love to come back to it

[6:50:18] belfastcl: Summerset 2, Elsewyr 3
[6:50:18] CrunkyBrewster: I think it was Skyrim?
[6:50:22] Arcon_LP: Summerset
[6:50:23] byzantineicon: morrowind _> summerset _> elsweyr -> greymoor (skyrim) -> blackwood
[6:50:27] belfastcl: Greymoor 4, Blackwood 5
[6:50:30] h3ybrian: Summerset is best
[6:50:34] Robbsinsky: Elsweyr!
[6:50:36] CrunkyBrewster: oh yeah Greymoor rather.
[6:50:39] ambiotic: summerset is the best by far
[6:50:50] CrunkyBrewster: its Meh
[6:50:55] byzantineicon: blackwood is terrible. worst ESO expansion ever

[6:52:28] mustiparta: you can use those corpses for other necromancer abilities
[6:52:38] Sardren: Some necro skills consume corpses

[6:53:50] Slitze: i think they changed that with one tamriel
[6:53:55] CrunkyBrewster: yeah pretty much
[6:53:59] byzantineicon: the beginning area is still there. everything is just leveled to you now so order doesnt matter
[6:54:07] abracka_: that original starting area is the beginning part to the main story quest that the game originally launched with now
[6:54:08] Forztr: its still there if you pick one of teh OG zones
[6:54:08] h3ybrian: They removed it when Tamriel one came out
[6:54:17] h3ybrian: So you do that whenever now
[6:54:19] duhMarSeeYa: You can buy a merchant ally in the crown store and sell stuff anywhere by pulling the pet out
[6:54:32] Slitze: right click an armor piece and enchant it
[6:54:35] CrunkyBrewster: if you want to focus on end game later, you'll wanna deconstruct some of that gear

[6:58:02] sainstrife: All those skyshards all those skill points
[6:58:02] h3ybrian: God I love this game. Will never get old
[6:58:13] Shrenko: you can mount now I think
[6:58:14] shortyforthewin: how much does this game cost and are it subscription on it
[6:58:26] SilkeySmooth: and thats just the overland content.
[6:58:27] cuckoomucu: at lvl 10 u get the main quest
[6:58:30] h3ybrian: No subscription needed. Just an option
[6:58:30] Rudric_Ice: BibleThump
[6:58:35] CrunkyBrewster: I think the starter is pretty cheap. like $25?
[6:58:43] h3ybrian: There’s a 60$ bundle with everything including the new one coming soon
[6:58:48] CrunkyBrewster: OH damn you got that mount
[6:58:49] Darwoo: you need a sub for the crafting bag which is essential
[6:58:53] belfastcl: I think you can grab the quest from the zone guide
[6:58:58] Shrenko: check your quest log
[6:59:01] TheGaoSora: not an option if you plan on being a crafter though
[6:59:06] CrunkyBrewster: OH god yeah if you wanna craft you ESO+ is a Must
[6:59:08] shortyforthewin: looking good
[6:59:09] sealink1100: go to a wayshire,
[6:59:11] Narecotics: @Darwoo Not the way I play Kappa
[6:59:13] bypized: The Sub in this game is ike SWTOR
[6:59:22] belfastcl: check the zone guide
[6:59:28] Darwoo: @Darwoo Kappa
[6:59:33] h3ybrian: The one thing I wish they would change is making mount lvls account bound not character bound. Dumb you have to lvl it again
[6:59:36] sealink1100: there's a guy that will give you a quest to to north
[6:59:38] SilkeySmooth: zone guide
[6:59:42] betohero: there is a Zone guid now
[6:59:48] h3ybrian: Zone guide will start story
[6:59:53] betohero: *Zone Guide

[6:59:58] h3ybrian: Go to map and hit zone giide
[7:00:19] sealink1100: go east
[7:00:28] CrunkyBrewster: oh right yeah the Map + Zone Guide will give you the intro quest
[7:00:29] h3ybrian: You can start zone story through zone guide in map
[7:00:32] SilkeySmooth: look at your zone guide
[7:00:33] betohero: Map> Zone Guide i think that the way to go
[7:00:40] sainstrife: @h3ybrian Yes I 100% agree that is one of the many negatives this game has
[7:00:48] Narecotics: 1 mil gold, O.o

[7:01:36] Rudric_Ice: oh no Furry
[7:01:42] Overlordrynx: I've had a horrible experience with tanking in this game so I look forward to another perspective!
[7:01:50] CrunkyBrewster: mmhmm
[7:01:51] SilkeySmooth: yea
[7:01:54] Shrenko: there is allways a skyshard in every dvelve and an end boss @Towelliee
[7:01:59] CrunkyBrewster: Zone Guide button
[7:02:07] h3ybrian: Tanking is iffy, not enough aggro skills. My companion healer is the best tank bc he always aggros
[7:02:08] betohero: out from Delve i think
[7:02:14] CrunkyBrewster: yup thats it
[7:02:28] sainstrife: Tanking take alot to get used to in ESO u can't just pull everything and expect ur healer can keep u up
[7:02:34] betohero: "Start Zone Story" down there
[7:02:35] Overlordrynx: The whole aggro system is just silly
[7:02:45] CrunkyBrewster: yup
[7:02:50] Chuckforfun: @Towelliee what made you to paly again eso?
[7:02:54] CrunkyBrewster: thats the breadcrumb basically

[7:04:16] CrunkyBrewster: i wouldnt do it in dungeons though LUL
[7:04:26] sainstrife: I really wish animation canceling wasn't a thing in this game It's the number one thing that turns my off of ESO's combat
[7:04:27] Chugworth: ESO combat feels so clunky
[7:04:38] DragonofWolves: I wonder how crazy 1 shot macros in WoW would get if blizz removed the CD from abilities.
[7:04:47] Vaedrun: @Chugworth It is, can't get used to it somehow
[7:04:53] CrunkyBrewster: eh yeah it's not the greatest imo either. hence why i wont bother with Vetern Dungeons.
[7:04:55] h3ybrian: Combat needs an overhaul but it’s passable. At least they finally overhauled the champion point system
[7:05:04] Chugworth: @Chugworth same man and I really tried
[7:05:21] SilkeySmooth: the combat is the best thing about eso
[7:05:24] xXSiebzehnXx: Do you still have to do the weapons switching?
[7:05:34] h3ybrian: Yea @xxsiebzehnxx
[7:05:50] Alaquane: I like the limited action bar
[7:05:50] h3ybrian: Some classes are more complicated than others tho
[7:05:53] xXSiebzehnXx: towRee PizzaTime
[7:06:03] touchofpinkfizz: @SilkeySmooth has it improved as that was always an issue with the game
[7:06:06] Longiboi: do you still have that wierd leveling in this game? get to level 30 or something then level again to 190 to cap ur gear, and 620 for points
[7:06:08] CrunkyBrewster: Necro is definitely difficult to properly play imo
[7:06:11] mustiparta: i honestly prefer eso combat, it takes some getting used to tho
[7:06:12] larry_livinlike: this game looks cool but where is everyone? seems kinda empty
[7:06:19] CrunkyBrewster: I main a Templar. that's been pretty easy
[7:06:30] h3ybrian: It’s lvl 50 than need to get to champion 160 to cap out gear
[7:06:31] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || The World Of Warcraft GEOGUESSR is INSANELY difficult! youtu.be/6kfMRPoOcOA
[7:06:41] CrunkyBrewster: @nickhazor they're all over. because it's one Giant Server basically
[7:07:00] LordxSaura: how can ESO`s combat feel so clunky to players who plays wow and FF14, i dont really understand. In wow playing a caster is so annoying you cant even move while casting a skill and you just have to press a button and wait (I am not saying thats a bad combat just dont understand how that can be such a good "combat while eso`s combat is clunky). In eso combat feels so much more active and immersive, especially in pvp.
[7:07:16] sainstrife: Classes are just template in ESO it's the different builds is where difficulty come in to play
[7:07:31] xXSiebzehnXx: Ff is definitely clunky and weird tbf LUL
[7:07:34] mustiparta: very true
[7:07:49] CrunkyBrewster: @fatihbaja from my experience as a primarily WoW player, i do not like the animation canceling bs about it if you wanna do proper damage
[7:07:52] Alaquane: why play your base class when you can become a werewolf instead?
[7:07:56] bypized: I feel like the closest to compare to is Guild Wars 2
[7:08:00] mustiparta: i think people expect it to be the same somehow, but it's just entirely different styles
[7:08:02] Slitze: do light attacks in between skills
[7:08:06] h3ybrian: I enjoy everything about eso. It’s one of the most frequently updated mmo and constantly has influx of new content and areas
[7:08:14] Glitchmoo: I just wish ability animations was better in ESO. They kinda suck
[7:08:19] CrunkyBrewster: yeah its very different styles
[7:08:20] eitsix: the animation canceling takes a little getting used to in eso
[7:08:23] xXSiebzehnXx: @alaquane not a fan of anything with frame cancellation for the most point
[7:08:38] jamarky23: The games needs a combat overhaul 100 %
[7:08:38] LordxSaura: @Crunku_ i get that but animation canceling even makes it less clunky to begin with. Like it makes it so much more fast phase. New World even had to implement animation canceling because people were complaning how clunky it feels
[7:08:41] jamarky23: game*
[7:08:57] CrunkyBrewster: also i found dealing with the community in the end game stuff they can be just as toxic as wow players LUL im not no thankyou, I'll pass
[7:09:02] h3ybrian: There’s a guaranteed expansion every year and throughout the year a sub zone is added and more dungeons added
[7:09:02] Slitze: this combat grew on me after 16 years of wow
[7:09:08] sainstrife: WoW players will always compare a New MMO to WoW
[7:09:11] LordxSaura: People who plays and loves ESO loves its combat especially in pvp @jamarky23
[7:09:18] Slitze: once it flows it's nice
[7:09:26] xXSiebzehnXx: One of the reasons I just stopped playing fighting games.
[7:09:29] Alaquane: Some of the stories were really great in this
[7:09:29] bypized: The only thing I don’t like of the game is that the engine feels outdated. Just like FF feels
[7:09:32] CrunkyBrewster: fatihbaja well to be fair i dont play New World either. but to each their own SeemsGood
[7:09:38] h3ybrian: The biggest issue with eso pvp is the connection problems. It’s not super stable so sometimes attacks just don’t happen
[7:09:45] jamarky23: @fatihbaja Yeah but its stockholm syndrome at this point, its objevtively bad nowadays
[7:09:47] h3ybrian: And then you die
[7:09:49] Ohh__Kay: @bypized literally every mmo has outdated engine
[7:09:49] LordxSaura: @h3ybrian they just fixed that
[7:09:57] bypized: @h3ybrian they just fixed that
[7:10:02] schneid4: i always come back to this game but cyrodil is unplayable
[7:10:13] theDirtyon3: ESO just got a massive server upgrade btw chat Microsoft inveseted pretty big into it
[7:10:14] h3ybrian: Oh good! Maybe I’ll not die from invisible attacks anymore
[7:10:18] LordxSaura: @fatihbaja no its not, i started ESO fairly new and actually started with necromancer, gosh i love how the combat feels especially in pvp
[7:10:19] AIphaSwift: moon sugar :D
[7:10:32] CrunkyBrewster: I actually enjoy Cyrodiil pvp funny enough. I do that quite a bit from time to time
[7:10:40] Slitze: usually there's a mini boss they drops gear and other stuff
[7:10:43] LordxSaura: and i played gw2 for 7 years, gw2 has such an action combat it feels too much after a while. ESO is great happy medium, still targetting but more action based
[7:10:48] Alaquane: yeah, delves are just public dungeons with mini bosses
[7:10:50] schneid4: its fun but it just lags
[7:10:55] h3ybrian: I also hate that they added pve elements to the pvp zone. I absolutely hated doing everything in cyrodil
[7:10:59] CrunkyBrewster: yeah that it does
[7:11:26] LordxSaura: @h3ybrian cyrodiil does have any hardly pve. Imperial City has though which has amazing world bosses
[7:11:31] CrunkyBrewster: oh god LUL
[7:11:40] TobeyT85: oh no LUL
[7:11:49] h3ybrian: It has 18 delves, like 12 dolmens, 10 quests per city. It absolutely has pve elements
[7:11:51] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[7:11:53] LordxSaura: @schneid4 they just fixed the lag, it feels amazing in Cyrodiil now
[7:11:54] CrunkyBrewster: that must have been aweosme fun
[7:11:54] h3ybrian: Oh and 46 skyshards
[7:11:54] Its_Rumple: thats everynight baby!!1
[7:11:57] jamarky23: @fatihbaja Okay dude, but the numbers for the game are dwindling so much each month, game is on its way to its death... they keep releasing the same formula in content and re-skins upon re-skins of mounts, if you cant see that you are just as blind as the rest of the community
[7:11:59] mustiparta: that's cyrodil for ya lol
[7:12:15] SivertSchultz: Is there tank/healer/dps trinity in eso?
[7:12:28] SilkeySmooth: eso is the one mmo you have never done a raid in
[7:12:32] derBoensch: @SilkeySmooth yes
[7:12:43] Slitze: every class can play every role
[7:12:50] LordxSaura: @fatihbaja you are actually wrong, since they fixed the lag game started to grow and gained %20 players in a week. Cyrodiil is population locked almost all day even at 9 am and 2 am
[7:12:52] CrunkyBrewster: @SivertSchultz kind of yeah but depends. in Normals while leveling everyone is the tank!
[7:12:58] Its_Rumple: yup
[7:13:04] SilkeySmooth: yes bgs are still in
[7:13:06] schneid4: yeah they are pre good
[7:13:07] bypized: People saying that this game is dying OMEGALUL
[7:13:12] theDirtyon3: yeah BG's are great too
[7:13:15] liviu_81: lgxTeehee
[7:13:18] h3ybrian: Trials and dungeons are some of the best parts in this game. Except you can choose the role you play, so a dps can queue as a tank and you now have no tank
[7:13:20] CrunkyBrewster: oh hell no this game is doing mighty fine
[7:13:36] h3ybrian: This game is far from dying
[7:13:40] theDirtyon3: this game just a got a massive influx with the new servers in PVPV
[7:13:41] LordxSaura: @fatihbaja last 2 expansions have been really average and that was their issue, but since they just fixed the performance issues in cyrodiil game is again getting so much players back.
[7:13:42] mustiparta: yeah battlegrounds are a ton of fun
[7:13:45] SivertSchultz: @Crunku_ What kind of tank classes are there?
[7:13:46] jamarky23: @fatihbaja Thats a tempoary influx of players, keep taking that Copium
[7:13:49] sainstrife: Who else enjoys melee stamina Sorcs builds? Running around with cyclone of lightning around u melting mobs is super satisfying

[7:13:54] CrunkyBrewster: the majority of my gameplay in ESO is run around, get shards, level Mages Guild, etc. I'm very very casual in ESO. not like WOW
[7:14:02] Slitze: yeah Vigor
[7:14:02] schneid4: you can level in pvp fully
[7:14:07] SilkeySmooth: a lot of people just cane back because of the server upgrades cyrodill is popped lock every night
[7:14:10] Slitze: and increase in mount speed which is crazy
[7:14:11] mustiparta: at lvl 10 do those quests and get rank 3 for the passive mountpseed increase
[7:14:13] theDirtyon3: @jamarky23 keep being a negative nancy bud
[7:14:14] eitsix: templar is the bestr
[7:14:16] Arcon_LP: Don't skip the Cyro tutorial, it will unlock Riding speed passive
[7:14:16] eitsix: best*
[7:14:27] h3ybrian: You should do pvp anyway to get vigor and mount speed ability
[7:14:39] CrunkyBrewster: @SivertSchultz every class can tank if specc'd for tanking basically. Its kind of like Diablo Builds in a sense
[7:14:44] jamarky23: @theDirtyon3 Am i negative for speaking the objective turth?
[7:14:49] SilkeySmooth: you can get vigor in bgs just pvp
[7:14:50] CrunkyBrewster: Oh Templar is my jam
[7:14:53] LordxSaura: @fatihbaja its not copium, you are just not part of the community following what has been going on. people only left this game due to performance issues and the moment they fixed it they are coming back. Seeing the world pvp maps population locked all day every hour of the day is facts
[7:15:02] josh8555: the turth yes l I'll l
[7:15:03] CrunkyBrewster: I survive as a Templar LUL
[7:15:07] josh8555: lol
[7:15:11] mustiparta: templar is a ton of fun at max level, jesus beam and jabby jabs
[7:15:17] eitsix: as a lazy gamer, templar is just too good
[7:15:20] theDirtyon3: @jamarky23 its your literal opinion how is it the "objective truth" wtf does that even mean? KEKW
[7:15:20] LordxSaura: @jamarky23 thinking that your opinion is objective truth is just wrong thats it
[7:15:22] CrunkyBrewster: yeah its fun. i love it
[7:15:25] CrunkyBrewster: especially in PVP

[7:15:52] ItsCD: Settings>Gameplay>Double tap
[7:15:55] SilkeySmooth: change roll dodge in controls to one button
[7:15:59] Rudric_Ice: what's the max lvl ?
[7:16:01] Slitze: combat settings and turn off Active Combat tips
[7:16:01] CrunkyBrewster: yeah same here jamarky23 i was in the beta and day one
[7:16:01] bypized: Surprised they haven’t cross played this yet
[7:16:05] h3ybrian: Make sure you turn off the ability to kill citizens
[7:16:14] Slitze: you can pull mobs to u
[7:16:18] Slitze: is one of them
[7:16:18] h3ybrian: Can fuck you over big time lol
[7:16:28] abracka_: yep
[7:16:34] abracka_: all separate
[7:16:34] jamarky23: @theDirtyon3 So im wrong about them releasing the same forumla of content each expansion? and re-skins upon re-skins of mounts?
[7:16:35] mustiparta: they're not
[7:16:36] bypized: Yeah
[7:16:41] schneid4: they arent
[7:16:42] MeisterPetze: no,. i would play again if my char isnt stuck on ps4.... sadly
[7:16:43] Slitze: they're seperate
[7:16:46] bypized: They’re not
[7:16:47] CrunkyBrewster: yup
[7:16:50] h3ybrian: They are not m
[7:16:58] abracka_: and you can't transfer character data from ps4/xbox to PC
[7:17:02] sainstrife: One of the Bone armor morph allows u to pull mobs to u
[7:17:09] CrunkyBrewster: maybe it's a mechanic thing about the two versions
[7:17:10] CrunkyBrewster: yeha
[7:17:12] derBoensch: pc u got addons
[7:17:18] h3ybrian: They are still 2 weeks apart update wise
[7:17:19] CrunkyBrewster: that too
[7:17:21] CrunkyBrewster: addons
[7:17:25] ShleppyGaming: What scrolling combat is that? #
[7:17:29] bypized: It has to be an engine thing. The engine is very old and addons
[7:17:37] LordxSaura: i think the main coding of the game was so spagetthi that its just not feasible for them, performance would prolly really suffer
[7:17:39] h3ybrian: Add ons and updates are 2 weeks early on pc
[7:17:41] Slannder: @Towelliee PC has addons
[7:17:43] CrunkyBrewster: thats part of the LUI, UI Addon tow is using
[7:17:59] CrunkyBrewster: EZ PZ
[7:18:00] BigBusiness: I actualy really enjoyed just going through these little mini dungeons that ur in rn
[7:18:06] CrunkyBrewster: mmhmm
[7:18:14] Walking85: Puncture can be morphed! VoHiYo
[7:18:17] ShleppyGaming: Dang I didn’t realize LUI had one….I’m using bandits and I love it but the combat text is pretty cool
[7:18:19] CrunkyBrewster: you need to clear Skyshard for achieve
[7:18:27] mustiparta: yup quest, skyshard, and boss
[7:18:35] LordxSaura: housing in this game is crazy good also
[7:18:42] Parru030: Yo Tow
[7:18:42] bypized: Let’s cancel ADDONS here too?
[7:18:53] CrunkyBrewster: no
[7:18:54] CrunkyBrewster: LUL

[7:19:51] CrunkyBrewster: i got a couple of them, but they're tiny like apartments in New York
[7:19:52] maccaruso: maccaruso subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! Almost three years....time is flying.
[7:20:17] CrunkyBrewster: its mostly cosmetics
[7:20:22] CrunkyBrewster: mounts, skins, etc
[7:20:22] byzantineicon: exp scrolls is about the most you can get power wise
[7:20:27] SilkeySmooth: bo it doesnt have power
[7:20:30] Alaquane: loot boxes with mounts and pets
[7:20:34] mustiparta: yeah like 1650 a month
[7:20:39] CrunkyBrewster: yeah exp scrolls and potions are there, but they're not like a power thing imo
[7:20:42] LordxSaura: exp scrolls and some research scrolls but not really makes a difference
[7:20:50] Walking85: ding
[7:20:50] sainstrife: lvl up time
[7:20:51] Rudric_Ice: Yoshi should call Ion and tell him to have the balls and ban raid addons too
[7:20:59] Alaquane: strongest buff the subscription gives you is the crafting mats storage
[7:21:01] Parru030: This was fun game, i like the "new" Thief and Assasin guilds, but had to stop playing because i was pllaying alone
[7:21:13] CrunkyBrewster: yup that Crafting Bag is a must
[7:21:22] CrunkyBrewster: they cripple you hard on Inventory imo
