[0:20:35] fdaapproved123: Making it look like that's not a gold purchase

[0:29:53] mopchild: speeds up your leveling time crazy amounts
[0:30:05] mopchild: yeah in thunderbluff
[0:30:12] Skry667: maybe, i cannot figure it out. sorry
[0:30:22] mopchild: you use lavaburst with 2x1h
[0:30:22] Karonte88: how does the hunter on follow work? Pet on agressive and you get full xp?
[0:30:27] mopchild: with overload
[0:30:47] mopchild: yeah just more dam

[0:31:35] mopchild: i literally rolled another shaman a couple days ago so now ive got a tauren for ele and orc for enhance
[0:31:47] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: @Sinostra lvl 10
[0:32:35] seraph_wow: @mopchild autismo unlocked
[0:32:54] mopchild: tauren for ele for sure
[0:32:58] mopchild: enhance id say orc
[0:33:00] Kreynz: stun resist best racial in the game
[0:33:05] SR_Wadlet: that stun resist not gonna be mega surely
[0:33:07] nwacompton: tauren for ele is really nice
[0:33:17] mopchild: warstomp lavaburst or warstomp + ele mastery chain lightning etc
[0:33:30] stalkerbronet: tauren has bigger range on spells right?
[0:33:30] Sqwibbie: Troll gang rise up
[0:34:04] mopchild: either way orc male looks bis
[0:34:06] Sqwibbie: Nah tauren has bigger range on melee attacks i believe
[0:34:08] mopchild: even if the racials not
[0:34:24] stalkerbronet: i think the range is for spells too
[0:34:34] RedlightsTV: o/
[0:34:36] Sqwibbie: maybe i have never heard that!
[0:34:39] varatupaj: troll can be good if you need to heal at low hp
[0:34:45] varatupaj: faster casts
[0:35:56] Sqwibbie: Im playing troll enhance lol def not the best but something about swinging fast as shit in WSG at 25% health just feels so good to me haha. Plus im no super good player lol
[0:35:57] RedlightsTV: need to pick up that flame shock ^^
[0:36:48] nwacompton: xd
[0:36:50] derty93: I wonder if resto shaman is gonna be good next phase. like more so than priest/druid
[0:36:58] Sinostra: also, where do you put your first talent point ?
[0:36:58] varatupaj: well its a troll Kappa
[0:37:00] mopchild: troll is fuuugly haha can only get away with it as a hunter imo
[0:37:13] Barrmana: 12 raiders from Barrmana have joined! 
[0:37:19] kasjuss: Shammy for the ele at 40?
[0:37:26] khourdrick: @derty93 will definetly be better at 40, shamans miss alot of their spells at 25. 40 is HUGE
[0:37:27] Kreynz: imagine if blizzard trolled us and we actually get the wrist/helm runes this phase
[0:37:44] kasjuss: What realm you rocking?

[0:45:08] nass691000: hi you going to play elemental ?
[0:45:36] sprouts21: sprouts21 watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! loving the content <3
[0:45:49] jazni_23: what got you excited about starting that shaman?
[0:45:53] Waterwalk: slot machine like in shadowlands?
[0:45:53] Kreynz: i wonder if shamans will get thunderstorm!
[0:45:58] rampage60232: yo hydra you on living flame us ?

[0:46:58] Zelimeth: silverpine trek right
[0:47:00] Shmigly: water quest is like 2 hours of walking
[0:47:04] FIREMAGZZ: LOTS of travel
[0:47:10] RedlightsTV: its just treking around the world map
[0:47:10] Slyxen: not a pain, just trek back and forth
[0:47:11] FIREMAGZZ: ask for warlok friends
[0:47:19] Shmigly: you gotta be smart with hearthstone or summons
[0:47:24] Zelimeth: me and sinostra will lvl horde locks real quick
[0:47:27] Shmigly: or itll take like 2hrs
[0:47:32] Zelimeth: ghetto HS?
[0:47:34] Typh93: ye
[0:47:34] Zelimeth: yeh prob
[0:47:45] Kreynz: dont think so
[0:47:46] Kreynz: they fixed it
[0:47:49] Sinostra: @Zelimeth yeah xd
[0:47:50] Kreynz: im pretty sure u just go to the GY
[0:47:56] Karonte88: you can
[0:47:57] Zelimeth: @Sinostra ah ur here :D
[0:48:01] Sinostra: didn't you want to learn your spells ?
[0:48:04] Karonte88: /run InviteUnit("a");C_Timer.After(1,function() LeaveParty() end)
[0:48:07] Karonte88: this worked
[0:48:22] Kreynz: @Karonte88 problem is after the timer you go to the GY not your hearth location
[0:48:25] Kreynz: at least when i last tried it
[0:48:31] Karonte88: aha
[0:48:32] aslaboii: Do you think druid will fall off in pvp already in phase 4? I play druid and warrior, unsure what i should play/lvl first

[0:48:51] kult1010: let's go bryan
[0:49:10] lordlaesooor: do you think they should nerf starsurge?
[0:49:19] Karonte88: ez
[0:49:20] Kreynz: what the frick!
[0:49:24] Kreynz: why didn't it work for me!
[0:49:26] Kreynz: aha
[0:49:28] Slyxen: don't they have a list of current runes being changed? don't recall Starsurge being on there
[0:49:55] Karonte88: describe tastte
[0:50:00] Slyxen: yes
[0:50:02] Zelimeth: rockbiter bis dmg
[0:50:02] mopchild: rockbiter is miles better
[0:50:03] RedlightsTV: yea i believe so
[0:50:22] jazni_23: what happened to the warlock?
[0:50:26] mopchild: flametongue was only better on private servers with flurry
[0:50:26] Shmigly: if you take the way of earth tanking leg rune, then you can have earth shock on a different CD giving you 2x shocks
[0:50:47] Shmigly: that tanking rune req you use rockbiter
[0:50:57] mopchild: duel weild quest is in thunderbluff
[0:50:59] Sinostra: i hope you're at least gonna level the warlock before p2
[0:51:19] Chazzmichael: I see you streaming on Youtube aswell, how is that working?
[0:51:20] stalkerbronet: are u interested at all in retail AWC?
[0:51:37] NorwayLars91: Woooot, this aint a priest!!!
[0:51:49] Kreynz: hyped for the war within?
[0:51:55] ano_xy: technically it is - shamans were in fact priests
[0:51:57] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[0:52:15] stalkerbronet: they just need to scrap retail and make wow 2 to get ppl interest
[0:52:28] RedlightsTV: now you pew pew
[0:52:29] voodoodrop: bruv.. ench tho.. you can also 1 POP people like a clothie
[0:52:31] Karonte88: what proffs?
[0:52:40] Slyxen: heh yesterday i got that Cats Eye Emerald on 3rd kill. was so happy. that ones usually takes forever LUL
[0:52:54] big_damgur: i got cats eye first try LUL
[0:52:59] Shmigly: you can time your lava nova totem, with the double lavashock crit and cap it off witha f rostshock then earthshock for basically a guaratneed 1 tap
[0:53:03] RedlightsTV: im stuck between the belt runes for p2
[0:53:10] big_damgur: and i swear to god i got 4 zevra hooves from the first 4 zevras KEKW
[0:53:21] voodoodrop: but for ench you should have gone tauren now you ruined it XD

[0:53:51] dasiach: really hope ele will get flame shock range increase at some point
[0:55:08] Shmigly: you kill things so fast its not even worth using
[0:55:20] Zelimeth: 2/3 ish
[0:55:22] RedlightsTV: @dasiach maybe a skillbook.. that would be awesome
[0:55:23] fatlance: Do you think mages will be strong in phase 2?
[0:55:28] ama__deus: @Hydramist how do I get numeric HP values on targets with the default unit frames? It works on the player frame, but not on any others
[0:55:35] Shmigly: its 4
[0:55:38] FIREMAGZZ: YES
[0:55:43] Zelimeth: yeah thats the combo
[0:55:44] FIREMAGZZ: thats what the good eles do
[0:55:47] Zelimeth: into frost shock or something
[0:55:48] Shmigly: you can reduce it with talents if you want, but its sort of a waste of talent
[0:55:51] Sinostra: @Zelimeth how many classes do you play ?
[0:55:55] nwacompton: i promise u tauren is nice
[0:55:56] vegontoast: yeah ive done it to quite a few people
[0:56:04] Tedantic: even i know tauren is bis and i'm trash :D
[0:56:07] Shmigly: play way of earth and you can use 2 shocks after it
[0:56:10] vegontoast: its nice that not all trinkets remove stun
[0:56:23] Shmigly: you WILL have painful cast pushback against everyone that attacks you
[0:56:26] Zelimeth: @Sinostra play them all :D i got like 6 classes 25 atm
[0:56:35] voodoodrop: and for ele troll cause of the casting speed racial
[0:56:37] DnB_Junkee: @vegontoast new trinkets have been datamined to do so
[0:56:39] Shmigly: but generally that almost helps because you land it all at the same time
[0:56:40] Sinostra: @Zelimeth and which one is your main ?
[0:56:59] ama__deus: @Hydramist how do I get numeric HP values on targets with the default unit frames? It works on the player frame, but not on any others. Can't figure it out Sadge
[0:57:17] Zelimeth: @Sinostra i wanna say priest in classic / SOD but mainly mage
[0:57:26] feodred10: ele sham coming for it all Feb 8
[0:58:19] klikka: hello hydra
[0:58:19] Sinostra: feels like i'm the only one that will keep maining lock in P2
[0:58:21] Show_nl: Hello hydra why are u rerolling sham?
[0:59:02] Kreynz: have you made a mage yet?
[1:00:12] snakemcklusky: Hey hydra do you think you will make an updated pvp tier list with all the new information on runes and gear we have gotten this week? I know it’s all speculation but they are still fun.

[1:00:56] MxKV__: i finally got the hang of some mage healing last night.  it's pretty fun
[1:00:58] feodred10: so, anyone remember how hard chain lightning used to hit especially lined up with earth shock? now imagine that with overload + lava burst. They will have possibly the strongest single target kill potential of any spec in history lol
[1:01:03] voodoodrop: what we think about war/rogue??
[1:01:15] feodred10: can kill 1 target two times over 😂
[1:01:28] mopchild: warriors still gunna be cracked
[1:01:37] ama__deus: Oh, moderntargetframes sorted me out SeemsGood
[1:02:02] Sinostra: Warlock is not gonna be as bad as you all think, mark my words
[1:02:25] feodred10: yeah I think Warr’s will be really good in the right hands. ESPECIALLY if they’re teamed up with a priest or pally — or both
[1:02:27] ama__deus: @Sinostra nobody thinks locks will be bad, though FeelsThinkingMan
[1:02:47] feodred10: They’ll be meh by themselves, but in a group they’ll be stronger than anything else in the game in a group
[1:03:11] stalkerbronet: and dwarves
[1:03:46] feodred10: naw locks will be strong as shit too.
[1:03:58] feodred10: just not shadow priest or ele sham strong
[1:04:08] stalkerbronet: maybe u skipped the prequest
[1:04:14] luzid7: do you stay tailor engi for p2?
[1:04:43] Allstarplayabro: Tailoring and enchanting going to be BIS PVE
[1:05:15] NotoriousICK: @Hydramist how can i win a duel against mage as a priest can u help for it please i really need it
[1:06:21] montek15: u think shammy will be good in phase 2?
[1:06:41] mopchild: like a MASSIVE LOSER
[1:06:42] feodred10: you have tremor totem yet?
[1:06:48] ama__deus: Imagine
[1:06:50] FIREMAGZZ: SO TOXIC LOL
[1:07:01] ama__deus: I'd be afraid of any 2+ people, because i'll be oom KEKW
[1:07:16] feodred10: hunter I think will still own everything in the game in an open world 1v1 lol
[1:07:25] feodred10: they can either kill you or just outright leave the fight
[1:07:31] DLC90itno: how good is warstomp on ely compared to hardiness u reckon?
[1:07:44] Slyxen: i can't tell, is that guy griefing or helping?
[1:08:05] mopchild: bit special
[1:08:06] mopchild: and lonely
[1:08:11] voodoodrop: yo quick Q..bfd is still going to be a raid or is going to fall to party range??

[1:08:37] RedlightsTV: the fact he hasnt buff'd or healed you im going for real bad salty griefer
[1:08:51] ama__deus: Does anyone know how much more rep a win gives during WSG weekend? 30?
[1:09:29] snoopy239: guys, I won the rod on my alt last night and passed it to a guildy - any good warlock weapons coming in P2?
[1:10:16] mopchild: not particularly
[1:10:20] mopchild: its mainhand offhand ?
[1:10:23] Sinostra: @snoopy239 epic dagger
[1:10:39] Sinostra: but it's like every caster
[1:11:07] snoopy239: @Sinostra thanks, hopefully I'm building up my Karma I guess haha
[1:11:11] Slyxen: duDudu
[1:11:12] ama__deus: I am slightly afraid of STV PVP event as a priest. Just a sitting duck sometimes
[1:11:15] feodred10: a good player on any other class can kill a Warr 1v1 really easily basically
[1:11:24] Kreynz: i saw they are getting taste for blood.... lets hope they dont get unrelenting assault later on!!! lmao
[1:11:26] o0darling0o: like hunter
[1:11:37] Sinostra: @snoopy239 i also really hhope the droprates of epics in gnome are better than in bfd ^^
[1:11:37] BoyeTV: Hi master, who u think will be the best at 1vX world pvp?
[1:11:49] feodred10: @o0darling0o well hunters can kill everything 1v1 lol
[1:11:52] o0darling0o: @BoyeTV boomkin still
[1:11:53] snoopy239: No joke haha @Sinostra
[1:11:53] Kreynz: hpal/war would probably still be the best comp in wrath if unrelenting assault didn't exist
[1:12:05] zesik: Where can I copy this weakauras?
[1:12:29] o0darling0o: no one can break snare, root have instant heals and dmg like boomkin
[1:12:37] o0darling0o: travel form
[1:12:42] Kreynz: frost mage will just be able to spam instants between ffb procs, fof + icelance, and nova procs from r1 frostbolt
[1:12:47] Jellyxoxotv: Mindspike into MB p2 i reckon
[1:12:56] Sqwibbie: what server? 󠀀
[1:13:03] darkstarklife: crusader probably
[1:13:07] Sinostra: just do ashenvale at this point
[1:13:09] ama__deus: Got to grind 13k rep still Sadge
[1:13:09] Sinostra: on US
[1:13:10] o0darling0o: and stealth is a big factor
[1:13:12] feodred10: Surprised no hunter pick lol. They’re about to be able to kill stuff even being boxed
[1:13:17] Jellyxoxotv: Mindflay level 36
[1:13:22] RedlightsTV: shout when your doing EU.. i'll deffo come.. priest shaman or druid
[1:13:29] Jellyxoxotv: feels like mindspike should me more valuable
[1:13:56] o0darling0o: hunter is strong but has no self heal so you cant make any mistake
[1:14:04] darkstarklife: People would be spaming MS 4/5 globals if it was much stronger I like it as a filler
[1:14:17] feodred10: y’all take care!
[1:14:23] feodred10: 🙏🏻
[1:14:24] ama__deus: is that circle of healing nerf new or old as well like POM/Pen?
[1:14:39] ama__deus: SeemsGood
[1:16:04] prodigy_wow: Howd the shaman leveling go?
[1:16:04] Sinostra: everyone has a pearl
[1:16:05] Leiloni: are you on a US server?

[1:17:49] nobleguyyy: @Hydramist you said rogues priests are good whats your opinion about mages bro ?
[1:18:04] Leiloni: would you ever play any non-priest healer as an alt?
[1:18:12] o0darling0o: i live from welfare and have more time to play. us citizen have to work
[1:18:18] Sqwibbie: sunday

[1:19:21] nobleguyyy: @Hydramist you said rogues priests are good whats your opinion about mages bro ?
[1:19:23] o0darling0o: no levitate yet?
[1:20:01] Ninemmglock: wait what

[1:20:50] Ninemmglock: i didint know either
[1:20:53] o0darling0o: u playing on EU?
[1:21:20] Skry667: it resets after 4hrs of ingame play
[1:21:35] Skry667: or 12hrs offline in an inn
[1:21:56] o0darling0o: inn only?
[1:22:05] Bolveg: 8h in the inn
[1:22:09] Bolveg: Offline
[1:22:46] NotoriousICK: @hydramist can you teach how can i win duels agains mage as a priest if pos
[1:23:05] nass691000: only shadow talents ?
[1:23:05] baade123: howcome you dont use bagnon addon?
[1:23:23] StreamElements: Excited to be partnering with HelloFresh! Use my code POGUKFRESH3312 and get 60% off your 1st box + 20% off the next 2 months + free gifts! https://strms.net/hellofresh_hydramist #ad
[1:23:37] Kreynz: bagnon g ives a ton of errors
[1:23:39] Kreynz: i wouldn't recommend it
[1:23:40] Cafe0le: adibags bis
[1:23:51] moarpwp: @Hydramist I was playing lock but for phase2 I will pass lock and reroll shadow priest. As horde do you recommend Undead or Troll. I mean shadowguard is good but will of forsaken superb thou.
[1:23:55] baade123: the main reason i like it is the cleanup button which auto organizes and that you can seearch for items in them
[1:24:35] Slyxen: @baade123 +1
[1:24:36] Kreynz: it doesn't show until all 10 people are joined
[1:24:40] xhosas: it only shows when all ur team joined
[1:24:41] Leiloni: it shows near the end
[1:24:43] Extramediums: don't think it'll show until the full 10 are in
[1:24:51] dasiach: only shows, when both groups are full
[1:24:52] o0darling0o: when it shows late its premade
[1:24:52] Longtimer49: they said something about choosing your priest racials at the start of sod so i'd go with whatever you think is cooler @moarpwp
[1:25:28] almightysupersaiyansleaze: U can choose racials now in p2 chat?
[1:25:32] moarpwp: @Longtimer49 yeye then UD king
[1:25:36] Slyxen: undead is bis, so LUL
[1:25:38] Ananaass__: doesnt show until you have 10 players on ur team
[1:26:23] prodigy_wow: Close game xD
[1:27:56] Kreynz: im on US but a different server + alliance :(
[1:28:00] Kreynz: we need cross server and cross faction queuing
[1:28:21] Studiovirtanen: @Kreynz NO
[1:28:24] Slyxen: I thought it does do cross server
[1:28:25] xhosas: only reason they winning is coz they have good comps
[1:28:32] ama__deus: Going into a prem right now without a single boomie monkaGIGA
[1:28:42] perseay797: Will you grinding WSG the whole day of 7th? @Hydramist
[1:29:18] ama__deus: @Hydramist why do you usually bait dispels with r1 forts instead of r1 inner fire for half the mana? FeelsThinkingMan
[1:29:31] Kreynz: how much exp do you get per 3 token turn in?
[1:29:35] reggieface420: ive noticed that no one is dispelling my troll racial at all on sod, i wonder if they even know what it does
[1:29:38] reggieface420: u get 1200 kreynz
[1:29:44] reggieface420: unless ur level 30
[1:29:53] reggieface420: u get 1500 at 30
[1:29:56] ama__deus: Makes sense
[1:30:17] Longtimer49: you guys think the druid datamined "dreamstate" rune will increase all nature damage to target or just for the druid himself? if its the former expecting ele to top dps
[1:30:24] Kreynz: so i should farm stocks to level 30 then hand in wsg marks
[1:30:25] Kreynz: then go SM
[1:30:47] reggieface420: i don't know for sure but i'm confident stockades 25-30 is gonna be super rough
[1:31:02] Kreynz: i full clear stoccks on my mage in 13-14 min so im not worried about that
[1:31:02] reggieface420: sort of need a quest log
[1:31:16] reggieface420: oh right i was assuming u were 5 manning from 25
[1:31:21] reggieface420: i forgot mages
[1:31:21] Lunaatj: Hey, someone mentioned the IF missing WA not working on Discord.
[1:31:25] Lunaatj: Any ideas, Ryan?
[1:31:26] Lunaatj: FeelsThinkingMan
[1:31:32] Kreynz: nah but my priest and mage are on diff accounts so ill have my priest + mage in stocks and solo on mage
[1:31:35] BRADLIKESPVP: @Kreynz Lets see how you do that after the 80% healing nerf
[1:31:37] Kreynz: to level my priest for free
[1:31:52] Kreynz: @BRADLIKESPVP take a look at my highlight vid on channel, i did it in 14 min without regen (running burnout) so it's easily possible
[1:32:20] reggieface420: if i was able to get 30 before my marks expired i'd hand them all in at 30
[1:32:21] Lunaatj: Can you link the IF missing WA here or DM me on Discord I'll just give him that link and mention you've not changed anything recently.
[1:32:27] reggieface420: the exp is a big jump
[1:32:31] Lunaatj: hydraKit
[1:32:37] BRADLIKESPVP: @Kreynz Look at my highlight video, Im jesus in the flesh
[1:32:52] Lunaatj: Hotspot Pog
[1:34:59] fakemejo: bro i came back for ele levling, and u r back to priest, sadge..
[1:35:09] Lunaatj: hydraF
[1:35:19] xplicit39: blizz making everyone sweat for those 2 days for min max hahaha
[1:35:23] 0hlando: what class do u think will be scariest in pvp p2
[1:35:36] Leiloni: how do you get the nameplates to show class colors. Leatrix?
[1:36:33] NotoriousICK: !talent
[1:36:34] Longtimer49: @0hlando ele
[1:36:34] jimbonni: o7
[1:36:39] DnB_Junkee: @Leiloni AdvancedInterfaceOptions
[1:36:41] NotoriousICK: !talents
[1:36:41] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[1:37:22] NotoriousICK: @hydramist can you show talents please
[1:37:33] numero5218: 6 days man 6 days
[1:38:14] DnB_Junkee: so does sod p2 launch 1pm PST in europe as well?
[1:38:23] StreamElements: Excited to be partnering with HelloFresh! Use my code POGUKFRESH3312 and get 60% off your 1st box + 20% off the next 2 months + free gifts! https://strms.net/hellofresh_hydramist #ad
[1:38:48] numero5218: I’m NA idk lol
[1:39:22] xhosas: take me to the gulag? DansGame
[1:39:52] causemosmvp: best song
[1:40:10] reggieface420: @DnB_Junkee yes
[1:40:15] reggieface420: its a global launch
[1:40:19] DnB_Junkee: ty
[1:40:31] reggieface420: EU usually gets completely fucked, almost all launches are at 1am, this one is at like 9pm
[1:41:13] DnB_Junkee: which is fine, as I dont need to take that day off and fridays is off for me anyways :D
[1:41:18] crowdctrl19: https://www.bluetracker.gg/wow/topic/eu-en/492046-marks-of-honor-in-season-of-discovery/
[1:41:22] crowdctrl19: the eu post, 7th
[1:41:24] Longtimer49: that's because the world revolves around us americans. just kidding lol
[1:41:31] Extramediums: sluggish due to ping, maybe tick rate of server as well? I don't know if this version of the engine used for SOD/Vanilla have things like updated batching and whatnot
[1:41:40] reggieface420: they do
[1:43:04] reggieface420: next patch shamans can freedom and u can trinket hamstring too
[1:43:05] Extramediums: well, it WOULD make sense for the american servers to feel like movement is 'heavy' when a large drink is 2 liters
[1:43:12] reggieface420: we're all gonna make it
[1:43:43] acaciashrub: spider belt and that trinket from gnomer that has same kinda effect is nice
[1:43:46] reggieface420: the shaman freedom is actually crazy, the totem has 40 yard range
[1:43:47] Longtimer49: 2 liters? i'll need about 10 of those throughout the day
[1:44:01] reggieface420: they can freedom you from jamaica
[1:44:13] Longtimer49: i thought the sham freedom was personal only
[1:44:18] DnB_Junkee: @reggieface420 I doubt it's actually gonna make into the game
[1:44:26] Leiloni: freedom totem?
[1:44:28] perseay797: At which time p2 comes out to EU exactly boys?
[1:44:31] Studiovirtanen: @Longtimer49 What is sham freedom
[1:44:52] Longtimer49: theres a datamined rune that does the blessing of freedom effect
[1:45:00] reggieface420: The totem also grants the target immunity to movement impairing effects for 10 sec.
[1:45:11] reggieface420: seems like you can give it to your friends
[1:45:24] Longtimer49: wouldnt it be targets?
[1:46:05] Studiovirtanen: @Longtimer49 Wow
[1:46:39] reggieface420: Summons a Decoy Totem for 10 sec with 5 health at the feet of the target that will redirect the next melee or ranged attack made against the target to the totem instead. The totem also grants the target immunity to movement impairing effects for 10 sec.
[1:46:49] reggieface420: hmm yeah ur right, no removes
[1:46:52] reggieface420: just grants immunity
[1:47:40] Longtimer49: "Summons a Grounding Totem with 5 health at the feet of the caster that will redirect one harmful spell cast on a nearby party member to itself every 10 seconds.  Will not redirect area of effect spells.  Lasts 45 sec." thats grounding totem. so comparing the two i dont think its gonna work on party members
[1:47:46] Lunaatj: Come back Pog
[1:48:02] Longtimer49: otherwise it would say nearby party members
[1:48:06] Lunaatj: It's on like Donkey Kong.
[1:48:09] Lunaatj: hydraCreep
[1:48:25] reggieface420: it doesnt work for the entire party tho
[1:48:28] reggieface420: just the person ur targetting
[1:48:30] reggieface420: is how i assume it works
[1:48:34] Longtimer49: ooh maybe
[1:49:07] reggieface420: anyway if its real it would be crazy
[1:49:13] Longtimer49: yea would be nuts
[1:50:31] reggieface420: when i was messing with the spriest sims
[1:50:44] reggieface420: if you crit a death wearing the new irradiated set, you died
[1:51:40] reggieface420: so i guess that's why its 50% now
[1:51:43] Sinostra: ashenvale's coming up
[1:51:52] Beckon911: Beckon911 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:52:00] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[1:52:06] Lunaatj: hydraSub
[1:52:26] Lunaatj: Yeah, they had 2-0 up pretty easy.
[1:52:30] Lunaatj: They thought they had it in the bag.
[1:52:49] Lunaatj: But little did they know, they're like Hydra's bags.
[1:52:53] Lunaatj: Disorganized and shite.
[1:52:57] Lunaatj: hydraT
[1:53:03] reggieface420: a crit death in gnomer pre bis is 1500
[1:53:06] reggieface420: LUL
[1:53:15] reggieface420: void plague average cast 1401
[1:53:33] bassiemon123: U were right, it wasnt to bad. Half my face still numb, but thank god i got it over with.
[1:54:00] bassiemon123: Yeee pritty mutch
[1:54:16] Toppers25: what addon shows what you can dispell?
[1:54:45] Skry667: you still have your boofs! GG
[1:54:45] Lunaatj: EZ Clap
[1:54:45] xplicit39: HUGE WIN
[1:54:51] nailerak: woooooooooooo
[1:54:54] perseay797: EZ Clap
[1:54:58] bassiemon123: 21/0 now thats a nice score
[1:55:02] reggieface420: its crazy how powerful u are vs their fc druid with death, he can't heal himself and you destroy him
[1:55:10] phailix: DMF buff in bgs
[1:55:14] phailix: balls of steel
[1:55:22] NKT0X: What sayge bugg u chose?
[1:55:23] jenxgg: warsong weekend?
[1:55:27] NKT0X: buff
[1:55:39] prodigy_wow: as soon as you said "im gonna try hard" the whole team also went try hard mode
[1:55:46] jenxgg: nice
[1:56:01] daggerslife: guys you goin dungeon spamm or questing for the most part ?
[1:56:11] DnB_Junkee: btw: if you have the drums in inventory, you cannot loot the ashenvale q item (so I've heard)
[1:56:20] prodigy_wow: You know they disbanded xD
[1:56:27] bassiemon123: Wonder how mutch exp bfd will give
[1:56:30] reggieface420: u cant even loot the quest item if u have drums active
[1:56:32] prodigy_wow: 30 min loss vs pug
[1:56:40] phailix: Just do 2-3 lvls of dungeon the day of launch and you get go questing after
[1:56:47] bassiemon123: Kinda wanna go in with a 24 Just to test
[1:56:47] phailix: there will be so many dungeon groups
[1:56:51] shingoshango: do you think going deep holy is viable for pvp in p2? deep disc for a 3min PI doesn’t seem worth when spiritual guidance in holy give you the same pending the amount of spirit you have. also we have so much dmg mitigation already, barrier rune, dispersion, PS etc
[1:57:13] reggieface420: i found some "bfd grant xp" stuff on wowhead, two different spells that got datamined, one gives 3000 exp and another gives 5000, so i guess bfd is atleast 23k exp
[1:57:27] Kreynz: stocks is 150k exp per hour solo and it's 36k exp to level 26... lmao
[1:57:34] Kreynz: kinda hard for horde to do stocks
[1:57:38] Grumpy_Orange: Is there going to be  dungeon lockout or can dungeons be spammed?
[1:57:45] Kreynz: mages gonna be flying
[1:57:49] phailix: Questing is going to be horrible unless you stacked your quest and can get ahead by turning in fast and go to new quest hubs
[1:58:23] Kreynz: ive been doing it with burnout for practice
[1:58:28] Kreynz: i still full clear in under 15 min
[1:58:34] Kreynz: so no healing at all
[1:58:42] Extramediums: wait, so they're making mage healing even worse?
[1:58:48] reggieface420: sort of
[1:58:54] phailix: You think mages will be able to solo SM at some point in p2?
[1:58:55] Longtimer49: you mean i cant afk clear rfc on my level 16 mage anymore?
[1:58:56] Extramediums: yikes
[1:58:59] reggieface420: they are making the healing u get from aoeing way worse
[1:59:29] Kreynz: yep that will apply to living flame as well
[1:59:38] daggerslife: @phailix do u believe there will be so much dungeon spamming grps really ?
[1:59:48] Kreynz: surprisingly though, arcane explosion still does a LOT of healing if there are enough mobs, like 15+ haha
[1:59:54] reggieface420: i think a lot of people will dungeon spam on launch
[2:00:00] reggieface420: yeah kreynz, have u seen the bfd speedruns?
[2:00:05] Extramediums: I mean, I haven't healed much other than 5 mans with my mage, but still, I hope there's going to be decent single target compensation and something for raid healing other than mass regen
[2:00:12] reggieface420: the mage tanks the entire trash between lorgus and kelris
[2:00:18] phailix: @daggerslife most people arent reddit warriors or dont watch stream, so they did all quest for gold. They will have to go dungeon grinding
[2:00:19] reggieface420: with arcane explosion aoe
[2:00:23] Kreynz: @reggieface420 yep I haven't done a proper speed run, just a normal run where we do some of the pillars in a similar way (18 min run)
[2:00:28] Kreynz: and it seemed very good
[2:00:39] phailix: @daggerslife even in classic there were a ton of dungeon levelers
[2:01:03] prodigy_wow: You leaving my group made me layer
[2:01:07] prodigy_wow: i dont get this stuff
[2:01:11] PaEu: At what level can u participate in ashenvale?
[2:01:34] daggerslife: @phailix was wondering what if login server crash and u cant join the guys u arranged for dungeon farm, but it seems it wont be problem to join any other random guys as a healer
[2:01:53] fiskensfriend: @Hydramist the changes buffs mage single target healing. AE now recieves 150% increased single target healing. Pog change for duels 1vs1
[2:01:53] reggieface420: i think most ppl will farm stocks on alliance
[2:01:55] Buffoncete: it is incredible there are still 6+ layers in SoD, poor wotlk
[2:01:56] reggieface420: as a 4-5 man
[2:02:20] reggieface420: as horde u will go to rfk
[2:02:21] phailix: @daggerslife plus, dungeons are normally more stable than the open world. It prob wont crash as much
[2:02:33] evermanq111: what is the priest pvp spec in wow vanila? is priest good in wow vanila pvp ?
[2:02:47] reggieface420: there's a logout skip for horde to get to stockades aswell i guess if they wanted to solo it
[2:02:54] phailix: Priest is BiS healer in wow vanilla @evermanq111
[2:03:15] phailix: for pvp, it's the only healer that can dispel for horde @evermanq111
[2:03:26] Kreynz: @reggieface420 i will be leveling my mage + priest (2 accounts) same time by soloing stocks, but im not sure about what to do for 30+
[2:03:31] twitchnamebkr: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:03:32] Kreynz: i guess i try to solo SM GY but i'd have to learn it
[2:04:15] prodigy_wow: Is there a mage solo GY already discovered
[2:04:16] reggieface420: I think SM is really the only option
[2:04:17] prodigy_wow: ?
[2:04:26] prodigy_wow: Idk why people are sleeping on stockades
[2:04:27] phailix: Is it me or no one is playing warlock right now
[2:04:32] daggerslife: As a horde what would be the dungeon spamm from 25 - 30, before u go to SM graveyard
[2:04:32] evermanq111: @phailix what about 1v1, is priest getting farmed by everone ?
[2:04:39] reggieface420: There's a ton of fences / los spots in gy, i'm sure mages could get it done
[2:04:42] Kreynz: @Prodigy________________ there is a video from 2019 of it being done at level 34 so im sure it's possible with runes and bfd gear at 30
[2:04:48] fiskensfriend: @Hydramist if i read correctly the changes buffs mage single target healing. AE now recieves 150% increased single target healing. Pog change for 1vs1
[2:04:48] reggieface420: well remember
[2:04:54] reggieface420: that instances are also buffed
[2:05:03] prodigy_wow: @Kreynz Seems like youd have a nice time with less resists in Stockades
[2:05:04] Kreynz: oh yer
[2:05:21] reggieface420: RFK mobs for example have around 40% more hp than they do on era
[2:05:23] bassiemon123: @fiskensfriend cant u Just purge that shit
[2:05:25] reggieface420: level 28s
[2:05:26] phailix: @evermanq111 as a healer, kinda, you can win vs some classes, but it's scuffed. In vanilla, if you go shadow, you can 1v1 most classes easily. For SoD, priests are pretty strong rn, so they can kill most classes even as healers
[2:05:33] Kreynz: i noticed that mobs in the world have a longer leash range than normal as well
[2:05:49] prodigy_wow: @Kreynz Thats classic, you can kite a mob forever
[2:05:53] phailix: shadowstrike KEKW
[2:06:00] prodigy_wow: @Prodigy________________ unless you mean even if you didnt touch it ;o
[2:06:04] evermanq111: @phailix so the ultimate pvp spec for vanila pvp is shadow?
[2:06:06] Extramediums: I have NEVER seen shadowstrike in a bg lol
[2:06:09] Kreynz: @Prodigy________________ yes i understand that, i mean without touching it
[2:06:18] bassiemon123: These premades are dog if they get split

[2:06:25] daggerslife: @phailix which dungeon would u farm 25-30 as a horde ? RFK is 2 high , SFK is 2 low o.O  i know we go sm graveyard after 30 or at 28 even
[2:06:26] reggieface420: leash ranges depend on the mobs level too
[2:06:33] phailix: @evermanq111 for solo pvp, yes
[2:06:38] reggieface420: every 10 levels, leash ranges get bigger
[2:06:47] DeathToad007: @daggerslife you do bfd at 25 and hope to get to 27
[2:06:59] Kreynz: @reggieface420 so where i noticed it is the gnolls in wetlands, on hardcore i was aoe farming them and theres a spot i know very well the mobs releash (by pulling the  caster)
[2:07:07] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: slaughtered KEKW
[2:07:12] Kreynz: but on sod, they dont reset at that spot, you need to run like 20 yards further
[2:07:15] Buffoncete: you turn quests and get to almost 29, then do BFD and get to 30 and half, that's first 2h
[2:07:36] bassiemon123: Ohh u getting clean on the jumps
[2:07:40] phailix: @daggerslife if you have a group, sfk, but just the first part, kill for 15min and reset, then move to razor at 27
[2:07:40] Amoxychillen: Australia says hi
[2:07:44] Amoxychillen: <---fyir
[2:08:02] reggieface420: I don't think u can get 29 from a quest log, that should be like 140k exp
[2:08:03] xdingerx92: whats the shadowfrom tune? anyone know
[2:08:15] reggieface420: its a bit too much, for horde anyway
[2:09:27] Extramediums: I'm excited for all the new dungeons and newly added gear. SOD has really taken over my wow time. Vanilla was so much fun back in the day and this is like the classic plus that I always hoped would improve upon it
[2:10:44] daLuhz: it's too bad I can't get both improved wrath and swift mend on my druid sadge
[2:11:14] bassiemon123: I think with ulda being lvl 40 dung we might see some pendulum on the AH
[2:11:26] reggieface420: one thing i dislike is
[2:11:31] prodigy_wow: its a circle of healing angle
[2:11:32] reggieface420: the nameplate range
[2:11:39] Kreynz: need to figure out how to aoe farm uldaman for pendulum xd
[2:11:54] reggieface420: i wonder how much a pendulum will cost
[2:11:59] reggieface420: with the new warrior slam runes
[2:11:59] Kreynz: will it even be bis?
[2:12:05] reggieface420: slam isn't normalized
[2:12:08] shozgodx: dude that lava burst from downtown lmao
[2:12:12] shozgodx: cya speedy
[2:12:13] reggieface420: so it just fucks with a 4.00
[2:12:24] bassiemon123: @reggieface420 its going to be crazy expensive
[2:12:30] Buffoncete: @Kreynz living boom + frostbite and jump jump jump jump
[2:12:38] bassiemon123: It is actually
[2:12:40] xdingerx92: how can he see dispellable buffs ion enemy? i cant see that on mine, add on or setting in game??
[2:12:42] bassiemon123: Already checked
[2:12:49] cyanne112: isn the epic 2.7 speed or some shit?
[2:12:50] warpot0305: more top end slower and proc can crit
[2:12:56] Kreynz: the epic has like 30 strength on it tho
[2:12:57] reggieface420: the axe is 3.3 speed now
[2:12:59] reggieface420: it got fixed
[2:13:01] Kreynz: how much dmg is that worth?
[2:13:32] reggieface420: quite a lot, the 2h build is spamming an ability that scales off of ap currently
[2:13:43] bassiemon123: 60:14=4,3 extra dps on ur weapon
[2:13:57] Kreynz: seems to me pendulum may be bis but surely the difference would be pretty small
[2:14:24] scroteyx: the proc on it is insane
[2:14:45] HeyImArty: hydraKit hello
[2:14:46] reggieface420: the 2h epic axe from gnomer is 44 dps
[2:14:49] HeyImArty: how are we today
[2:14:50] reggieface420: pretty strong
[2:14:55] bassiemon123: I wanna see a shaman with it. The 60% attack speed + pendulum. Myess pls
[2:15:41] warpot0305: chammy with jackhammer another 30% attack speed lol
[2:16:08] bassiemon123: Jackhammer actually more rare then pendulum
[2:16:23] HeyImArty: i gotta find some solid goldfarm before p2 drops, running low on gold
[2:16:41] Skry667: quest
[2:16:55] Kreynz: ive farmed like 3k gold from stocks boosting lmao.... wonder how long that will last me...
[2:17:11] eatmyshrts: ncie vid!
[2:17:16] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[2:17:38] bassiemon123: I have 50g for phase 2 xd
[2:17:43] bassiemon123: Pvp life problems
[2:17:45] DjemDruid: 31 raiders from DjemDruid have joined! 
[2:18:24] DjemDruid: yo yo
[2:18:34] phailix: 50g is fine
[2:18:34] Terrawan: djemdrFEZ
[2:18:35] DjemDruid: hydra when are you rolling a char on our server man
[2:18:42] DjemDruid: cruader strike EU bis server SMOrc
[2:18:46] warpot0305: enough for mount your g2g
[2:19:07] Terrawan: DjemDruid this is not even CS??
[2:19:09] bassiemon123: Ye saw they decreased the mount cost
[2:19:14] bassiemon123: Lovely
[2:21:53] bassiemon123: Any alliance know if u cant enter gnomer rn?
[2:22:10] Skry667: you cannot
[2:22:22] bassiemon123: Aah to bad, makes sense tho
[2:23:28] nobleguyyy: @Hydramist bro how is mages looking can you share your thoughts
[2:24:10] nobleguyyy: would u choose rogue over mage ?
[2:24:46] Longtimer49: the time of the melee is over. the time of the caster has come.
[2:24:58] Miralqt: What do u think of affli warlock next phase ?
[2:25:01] NeVolent: plus crazy mobility,... they can blink reset position and blink again
[2:25:01] bassiemon123: Warrior kinda looking fun aswel.
[2:25:15] PaEu: What proff do u think will be bis for ret palas?
[2:25:15] NeVolent: affliction is bad! if they dont give them UA
[2:25:19] Kreynz: @NeVolent that rune is phase 3 (if it's real)
[2:25:47] nobleguyyy: if you had to play rogue and mage which one would you choose for phase 2 ?
[2:26:05] nephcs: @nobleguyyy play both bro
[2:26:10] NeVolent: so they are gonna be the worst class in the game :P
[2:26:12] nephcs: the phase will last more than long enough to level 2 characters
[2:26:13] bassiemon123: @nobleguyyy thats all about personal pref
[2:26:19] NeVolent: cause priests will dispell evereything
[2:26:23] NeVolent: and locks dan do dmg
[2:26:28] NeVolent: cant*
[2:26:31] bisonkron: i'm hoping for some changes to the shaman runs that have been datamined. so far nothing interesting for resto
[2:26:38] bisonkron: runes*
[2:26:42] nobleguyyy: yeah I will play both but I am trying to know  hydras opinion
[2:27:05] Kreynz: life drain still cancels if you move like 15-20 yards away from the warlock right?
[2:27:14] NeVolent: yea
[2:27:19] NeVolent: it breaks
[2:27:28] Alori_: its meant to
[2:27:30] bassiemon123: @bisonkron prayge riptide
[2:27:35] Sinostra: more like 30-40 yards away
[2:27:46] NeVolent: its 20 stop the cap :P
[2:28:03] Alori_: yeah its MEANT TO break at 20 but server lag means it wont
[2:28:15] bassiemon123: Anyone else find it crazy that paladins judgement going to have more range then boomies rn
[2:28:19] Amoxychillen: pleasure having my premade owned by you hydra
[2:28:19] bassiemon123: With the rune*
[2:28:21] Alori_: I saw pshero run like 40 yards and that shit was still on him KEKW
[2:28:24] bisonkron: @bassiemon123 or something original if they are capable of it KEKW
[2:28:33] Kreynz: isn't it 40 yards with the rune? Or not?
[2:28:52] Alori_: the rune doesnt affect the range
[2:28:57] bassiemon123: @bisonkron naaahh they still dont care about shammies unfortunately, dont think so. Would be nice tho
[2:29:41] reggieface420: i think u have to strafe
[2:29:43] Sinostra: also locks will have a better range on it in P2
[2:29:58] NeVolent: better than who?
[2:30:11] Skry667: do you have a vidoe on leveling specs for p2 yet?
[2:30:16] nephcs: real men play destro
[2:30:16] Skry667: video*
[2:30:17] HeyImArty: Really excited for druids in P2, just seems fun
[2:30:17] NeVolent: priests that can 42yards mind spike and druids bombard from 42 yards also?
[2:30:25] oldkingcole01: are you gonna heal or shadow dungeons to 40
[2:30:30] prodigy_wow: for those who need to learn jumps  https://clips.twitch.tv/FurryGlutenFreeBoarPraiseIt-nD-kjX7nAdagNzt1
[2:30:34] NeVolent: warlocks are 100% trash next p

[2:30:45] Sinostra: @NeVolent no way

[2:31:44] floki77777777: !nameplates
[2:31:45] Nightbot: Make a macro with /run SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance","6e1")
[2:31:52] optik_rec0rds: fekhunter is also like the onlz powerspike tho
[2:31:56] MrQrazy: @Hydramist you see hunter get that Lone wolf 30% buff MM back on top over bm??
[2:31:59] bassiemon123: Felhunters are so tanky

[2:32:45] prodigy_wow: Thats really cool
[2:32:47] prodigy_wow: Ill steal that
[2:33:14] xdingerx92: how do you see enemy buffs?
[2:33:16] NeVolent: yea what i am sayin is at 40..u dont need RNG to bear LOCK
[2:33:28] misstherese: what is this ask for the moon 🌙 the moon best
[2:33:30] NeVolent: u beat them 100% of the time
[2:33:38] Longtimer49: @Prodigy________________ can you link clip? i missed it :(
[2:33:39] dildyj: did you see sw:pain got buffed? how does it feel?
[2:33:46] MrQrazy: thoughts on hunter lonwolf rune buff?
[2:33:52] prodigy_wow: @Longtimer49 https://clips.twitch.tv/FurryGlutenFreeBoarPraiseIt-nD-kjX7nAdagNzt1
[2:33:57] Longtimer49: ty
[2:34:03] chiief: POGGERS appreciate the updated detailed tier lists
[2:34:07] dildyj: I meant death, sorry
[2:34:13] NeVolent: well they tuned shadowform (datamine) for shadowspells to cost less mana
[2:34:16] Sinostra: @NeVolent priest will still be the only class that can spam defensive dispel
[2:34:18] MrQrazy: 30% inc
[2:34:25] reggieface420: they buffed shadowform yep
[2:34:29] MrQrazy: instead of 15%
[2:34:30] Kreynz: @NeVolent huh? link?
[2:34:44] bassiemon123: Oooh ye there is a new one i havent seen yet.
[2:34:52] chiief: chiief subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! POGGERS
[2:34:59] NeVolent: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/additional-class-tuning-in-phase-2-ptr-datamining-season-of-discovery-337505
[2:35:14] prodigy_wow: @Kreynz They are considering making shadow form reduce costs of spells while in form (maybe just shadow spells?)
[2:35:16] NeVolent: its datamines so no idea what they are gonna do
[2:35:28] Anhov: same slot as lion rune, so pretty pointless buff
[2:35:28] NeVolent: they tweekin some stuff last second xD
[2:35:30] prodigy_wow: @Kreynz but it just says reduces cost by 0% atm, not the actual value
[2:35:35] ugyesgyerek: there's a whole lot of new pet abilities datamined
[2:35:41] NeVolent: ye we dont know
[2:35:43] Ryett: is warlock really failing off that hard?
[2:35:46] MrQrazy: yeah im hoping i wont have to run bm all p2 KEKW i wanna be a true hunter again
[2:35:57] NeVolent: @Ryett suuuper hard
[2:35:59] HeyImArty: technically tigers fury becomes a completely different ability, but its through a rune
[2:36:00] cyanne112: i dont think LW is ever the solution in pvp, you lose 20% stats AND the pet has great utility even if they nerf its dmg to shit
[2:36:13] Ryett: @NeVolent damn, that sucks
[2:36:20] reggieface420: they haven't changed any baseline abilities iirc
[2:36:27] reggieface420: its a real pain apparently
[2:36:27] prodigy_wow: @Kreynz I feel like this PTR adjustments arent final so i wouldnt get too hyped
[2:36:39] NeVolent: plus i wanted Imolation aura for tankin ffs!!!! wtf did locks get? nothing except some stupid passives
[2:36:42] Crawf6: lonewolf be good in clusterfuck pvp
[2:36:45] bassiemon123: Omg totemic projection.....yessss im giga happy with that
[2:36:55] prodigy_wow: Shadow fiend and dispersion is probably enough mana for spriest
[2:36:58] HeyImArty: SoD must be a headache to work on lmao
[2:37:01] Amoxychillen: thats such a dumb technical thing..
[2:37:04] HeyImArty: with the "same client" bullshit
[2:37:08] Kreynz: nah that's not true they can just duplicate the spell with a new ID then use the new version on SOD
[2:37:13] Amoxychillen: we couldnt be bothered copying a sdeperate client so were stick with it
[2:37:26] reggieface420: yeah, it just means that rune abilities are going to be distinctly more powerful than standard abilities
[2:37:26] xdingerx92: how to see enemy dispellable buffs??
[2:37:27] HeyImArty: but Ryan, what realm is your EU alliance character on
[2:37:48] reggieface420: u are incentivized already not to press anything but the rune abilities
[2:37:55] reggieface420: compare sw:p and void plague its not close
[2:38:16] mylittlehombre: are you on US rn?
[2:38:26] HeyImArty: and will you actually play your EU alliance chars?
[2:38:42] Kreynz: wait so they changed disperse to not be usable while stunned?
[2:38:47] dildyj: @reggieface420 isnt there a rune that does +50% more damage with mind blast on targets that have pain though?
[2:39:03] reggieface420: yes dildy there is, its the same rune as plague unfortunately
[2:39:52] Sinostra: @NeVolent what server are you playing on ?
[2:40:08] Longtimer49: woah mutilate only 40 energy? thats crazy
[2:40:13] BlueMoon1337: 1 i gues each flag brings 25+10 reputation
[2:40:23] BlueMoon1337: or 35
[2:41:04] AleGfi: Are you going bfd on release @hydramist ?
[2:41:10] prodigy_wow: That was the druid that beat me
[2:41:12] AleGfi: P2 release that is
[2:41:13] prodigy_wow: in the tourney
[2:41:18] prodigy_wow: i lost to him twice
[2:41:31] kottessontv: hi hydra! all good??
[2:41:42] MrQrazy: u on CS -US?
[2:41:44] bassiemon123: Seen the new enchant? Pritty crazy, cause all spells/attacks to proc 60/90 extra dmg.
[2:41:45] prodigy_wow: I think Death is actually Bis
[2:41:47] fizgaroth1: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance hello DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:41:49] prodigy_wow: vs druid
[2:41:55] bassiemon123: Chance of*
[2:41:56] prodigy_wow: more blackout chances too
[2:42:05] reggieface420: the datamined exp grant from bfd is 3000 + 5000, so bfd is 23k exp at least, seems worth doing for sure
[2:42:22] bassiemon123: Ohh im an idiot, only applies to mech targets
[2:42:24] bassiemon123: Meh
[2:42:31] perseay797: @BlueMoon1337 35+10
[2:43:05] EpShade: @reggieface420 and it gives xp to all 10 players?
[2:43:13] Kreynz: they said bfd would give good exp til mid to late 30s but that doesn't really make sense
[2:43:17] Kreynz: what level do mobs go grey?
[2:43:27] reggieface420: @EpShade yes
[2:43:27] nitramgucci: !commands
[2:43:27] Nightbot: @nitramgucci -> The bot commands for this channel are available at https://nightbot.tv/t/hydramist/commands
[2:43:42] reggieface420: u dont get exp based on the mob level kreynz
[2:43:48] reggieface420: its the hardcore version
[2:43:49] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: @Kreynz green mobs give less exp
[2:43:59] reggieface420: each boss has an exp drop
[2:44:08] Kreynz: @reggieface420 so because the bosses are skull they'll just always give exp or something?
[2:44:19] nillgren: Better to just die instead of reviving
[2:44:27] reggieface420: in hardcore they made it so that when you kill van cleef in deadmines u get like 3k exp
[2:44:32] nillgren: I meant for the hunters
[2:44:35] reggieface420: i assume thats what they are doing here
[2:44:43] AleGfi: No inner fire all game though
[2:44:50] Kreynz: ye makes sense and the bosses are skull so they can't go green or grey or w/e
[2:44:57] reggieface420: @Kreynz the bosses are level 27
[2:45:02] perseay797: Yes, pet will res and get happy too
[2:45:05] reggieface420: they just show as ??
[2:45:07] HeyImArty: imagine if there was a weakaura that told him to inner fire
[2:45:11] HeyImArty: hydraKit
[2:45:13] AleGfi: Weak aura was up all game on your icon
[2:45:20] Ragemax_TV: I believe pets spawn when they do at GY
[2:45:20] HeyImArty: that's the point
[2:45:20] AleGfi: It was tilting me
[2:45:31] nillgren: Yeah pet always spawn
[2:45:50] Kreynz: @reggieface420 at what level does 27 become grey? i guess thats when it will no longer be worth
[2:45:55] Kreynz: is it 9 levels?

[2:48:14] varatupaj: does anyone know if troll beast slaying racial work vs druids?
[2:48:17] perseay797: No, res on WSG makes pet happy
[2:48:17] nillgren: Yeah
[2:48:25] artform_: it loses happiness yes
[2:48:30] perseay797: No
[2:48:32] perseay797: You cannot
[2:48:34] sheeshkebab139: only reduces its happiness
[2:48:36] nillgren: But you usually feed when you spawn anyway
[2:48:57] nillgren: Depends on the pet
[2:48:57] sheeshkebab139: maybe not during a bg, but after
[2:48:58] Darkblue1: no mshr goof
[2:49:02] Darkblue1: no mage food
[2:49:04] prodigy_wow: I think once it gets to a certain companion level it wont run away regardless
[2:49:14] nillgren: You can feed mage food, depending on the pet
[2:49:14] cyanne112: depends on the type of pet
[2:49:16] GrenadeHPC: A good hunter never runs out of food or ammo, has both in spades
[2:49:20] GrenadeHPC: but lots of bad hunters ofc
[2:49:49] perseay797: If hunter is killed and pet is dead, ressurecting at GY will make pet happy
[2:49:50] Isindell: When the hunter pet gets revived by angel it respawns with full happiness/hunger
[2:49:51] varatupaj: serpents can eat mage food cats cant

[2:55:48] Cafe0le: bet deepfreeze is one of the fake runes they teased
[2:55:58] moarpwp: @Hydramist why did you shift from keybind C shield to 1. I am still using your keybinds since 2008 :P
[2:56:32] lasagnalord13: @Cafe0le they can't blueball mages like that
[2:56:36] Unholy_john: I whispered you @Hydramist
[2:56:50] mello_drama: i mean i wouldnt say they wouldnt do that
[2:56:50] Kreynz: imagine if they get water ele in phase 4....
[2:56:51] HeyImArty: inbefore they get Water ele and deepfreezee in phase 3
[2:57:15] wreckedgum: what was the shadowform change? @Hydramist
[2:57:25] CoolTV: @wreckedgum https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/additional-class-tuning-in-phase-2-ptr-datamining-season-of-discovery-337505
[2:57:32] HeyImArty: I mean, it looks like they are giving "bigger" abilities to classes, dispers, deep, painsup etc, so i dont think water ele would be that surprising
[2:57:34] wreckedgum: @CoolTV legend thanks!
[2:57:36] artform_: percy pigs are so moreish
[2:57:36] nillgren: Im just terrified that my hunter will be best as melee

[3:05:28] Extramediums: oh god, Cata release when Priest couldn't out heal warrior auto attacks, warriors being immortal vs so many classes cause of how broken second wind was at the time. Rets not being able to kill anything at all. Great times lol
[3:05:30] perseay797: Yeah, that will be OP. 40 energy for 2 combo generator
[3:05:41] perseay797: And 45% crit chance by default
[3:06:01] HeyImArty: Says the man with a human priest
[3:06:12] steadyvince: ill be shadowmeld mindctrolling bro

[3:06:49] Kreynz: if they add arena tho...
[3:06:49] wreckedgum: im playing human for the +10% rep
[3:06:50] bassiemon123: Got a orc + tauren sham. Making a troll now aswel.
[3:06:50] prodigy_wow: front flips op
[3:07:07] Cafe0le: human male for the arenas at 60 YEP
[3:07:55] HeyImArty: imagine if Ashenvale wasn't lagging worse than the original cata servers during tol barad
[3:07:57] HeyImArty: holy fuck
[3:10:05] bassiemon123: Any tremors in the lair

[3:12:02] jtothep_7: is that a addon that highlight the magic buffs? purgable
[3:12:12] Slyxen: did he just low key diss his viewers? Kappa
[3:12:18] dogtooth481: do you have any idea how black out procs on mind sear? only on the target your casting it on?
[3:12:28] HeyImArty: wdym Starsurge costs me an entire 4 mana
[3:12:30] HeyImArty: hydraKit
[3:12:31] NeVolent: SeemsGood SeemsGood <3 <3 <3
[3:12:38] varatupaj: i think you should not be able to heal from 40yrds as well
[3:12:42] Slyxen: no, I mean people watching you LUL
[3:12:56] bassiemon123: Oohh mealstrom weapon now reduces mana cost of the ability aswel. Thats super huge.
[3:13:00] Habblanen: yeah cast time in current state
[3:13:01] NeVolent: 100% true
[3:13:10] Habblanen: running with 20% speed and 42yd range
[3:13:12] bassiemon123: Or better makes it free
[3:13:13] Habblanen: so bullshit
[3:13:15] prodigy_wow: Void plague also has to cost more mana
[3:13:24] HeyImArty: depends on if Devouring plague and void plague work on the most, lots of bleed/disease immune stuff in OG gnomer
[3:13:28] optik_rec0rds: i think starsuge should just increase nature damage taken for like 6 seconds instead of being a nuke
[3:13:33] flugrman: is there a better gnomer staff than epic rod?
[3:13:36] bassiemon123: Yee agree
[3:13:41] snakemcklusky: do you think shadow will be viable in raids next phase? or will we be stuck healing still?
[3:13:43] creatorstorm1337: i see ppl stockphile supply shipment is it true u can do it? :O
[3:13:57] HeyImArty: void plague is a disease right
[3:14:00] HeyImArty: im not tripping
[3:14:18] HeyImArty: then theres a good chance it wotn work vs alot of stuff in Gnomer if they keep the theme of disease/bleed immune stuff
[3:14:25] bassiemon123: Ur nit tripping
[3:14:29] bassiemon123: Correct
[3:15:25] moneyshotx_: the issue is i dont think they can touch core abilities of classes. so how do u nerf starsurge without completely gutting boomies
[3:15:38] HeyImArty: Will you make a non-meme (read: not human) alliance priest on SoD at some point?
[3:15:47] Unholy_john: inv Naasz
[3:15:53] Unholy_john: rogue
[3:16:09] snakemcklusky: do you think shadow will be viable in raids next phase? or will we be stuck healing still?
[3:16:30] perseay797: 50% seems like a looot
[3:16:35] perseay797: Is it still not enough>
[3:16:37] perseay797: ?
[3:16:39] optik_rec0rds: lake of fire is also a good example
[3:16:47] HeyImArty: druid leveling is hilarious tho if u get Starsurge at lvl 1
[3:16:48] prodigy_wow: @perseay797 I think it was 30% on release
[3:16:56] stalkerbronet: the ppl who made dragonflight are also in charge of SOD so i dont expect much
[3:17:05] prodigy_wow: @Prodigy________________ i lied it was 20% xD
[3:17:07] HeyImArty: first 15 levels is just pressing starsurge once per mob

[3:50:02] bassiemon123: New engi nades pooog
[3:50:04] moarpwp: @Hydramist tyty
[3:50:40] flodaverlane: mage having deepfreeze is the best rune we agree ?
[3:51:13] NeVolent: still super strong rune
[3:51:17] HeyImArty: Dispers unironically 1 of the best runes next phase
[3:51:20] moarpwp: fpr phase3 imo best rune felghuard or unstable affliction
[3:51:22] HeyImArty: Dispers is insane
[3:51:39] NeVolent: Felguard also will be so fun rune but felguard<felhunter
[3:51:50] HeyImArty: @moarpwp felguard and UA cant be compared, UA is so much better than everything else its not even funny
[3:51:52] NeVolent: but way more dmg
[3:52:10] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[3:52:25] saund: they removed all stamina
[3:52:26] saund: from EVERY item
[3:52:30] saund: its shite
[3:53:31] NeVolent: @HeyImArty well it depends who u are fighting...if u fight a priest yes if u fight ahunter in wpvp felguard is better
[3:53:31] Lunaatj: SirUwU
[3:54:32] NeVolent: i remember at tbc prepatch...felguard was fkn strong
[3:54:36] flodaverlane: shadow step next phase tho it was either that or cloak
[3:55:40] Locky987: I dont like cloak, rogue can just infinitely reset if they have it
[3:55:57] NeVolent: i mean 5 sec immunities its too much...cause they also get trinkets and reflect spells plus 9 sec stunlock...i think cloack is too toxic
[3:56:20] flodaverlane: its fun that blizzard seems to have so many new ideas of new spells for certain classes but some of them are just wotlk spells
[3:56:44] NeVolent: very few new ideas its kinda pitty
[3:57:31] HeyImArty: Shoot spirit of the redeemer in the back of the head
[3:57:32] HeyImArty: ty
[3:58:23] saund: @HeyImArty yea if that stays op, they will just ask every priest to go heal, even if there's two instead of shadow
[3:58:27] saund: in raids
[3:58:50] HeyImArty: eh doesnt matter in raid, SoD raids are piss easy
[3:58:57] HeyImArty: spirit of the redeemer is just unhealthy gameplay in pvp
[3:59:08] saund: but you can't be hit
[3:59:11] NeVolent: I remember dk having a nice talent that said reduce chance to dispel ur diseases or when u blight them they cant be dispelled...that would be so good for dot classes
[3:59:12] saund: so won't be too good in pvp no?
[3:59:37] NeVolent: yea u cant be hit or lose mana
[3:59:49] NeVolent: they should nerf to 10 sec or smth

[8:50:14] niceguuyx: whats your favourite class in so far in SoD outside of priest?
[8:50:42] LesGoTV: @Hydramist what weakness do you feel like feral has in p2?
[8:51:25] niceguuyx: you pick
[8:52:13] Genxq: I'm debating if i wanna do the whole exalted grind on my feral aswell for next phase
[8:52:17] Genxq: is it even worth it tbh
[8:52:37] LesGoTV: Doing it on my Spriest and feral now, its dreadful
[8:52:52] LesGoTV: but theres are no leather bracers next phase for feral so its kind of a must whereas priest gets 9 sp bracers in gnomer
[8:53:06] NeVolent: if u remove drainlife lock has nothing hehe
[8:53:26] NeVolent: true true
[8:53:42] Genxq: @LesGoTV So u would say its important to do for feral?
[8:53:43] niceguuyx: nerf starsurge buff wrath for example
[8:53:44] NeVolent: yea because if it gets resisted u are screwd lol
[8:53:51] NeVolent: but if its there u win
[8:54:07] LesGoTV: @Genxq Yea for leather agi users id say its kind of a must

[8:55:08] vrsswow: put it on like 2 min cd
[8:55:11] vrsswow: and thats it
[8:55:11] duxmusic: hey Hydra, rolling a priest on horde for pvp as shadow. Is Troll better than Undead?
[8:55:29] Sinostra: @vrsswow that's like saying put starsurge on a 2 min cd

[8:55:48] niceguuyx: wait thats confirmed?
[8:56:09] Mystylerocks: if they fix the range it would be okay, not cd
[8:56:12] Mystylerocks: it alrdy costs mana
[8:56:18] Mystylerocks: at least if it broke easily with range
[8:56:24] Mystylerocks: u could work around that
[8:57:08] Mystylerocks: ye
[8:57:12] NeVolent: kinda harsh imo
[8:57:19] 7eamviewer: contemplating deleting the shaman? ;)
[8:57:55] niceguuyx: do you know if the devs are rolling solo or taking advice from the connected pvpers etc?
[8:58:03] vmttmv: datamine had priest getting a similar training wheels rune for renew right?
[8:58:05] niceguuyx: they seem open to feedback
[8:58:37] niceguuyx: aggrend seems open to it like asking about raid release, doesn't have ego
