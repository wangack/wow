[0:01:05] StreamElements: TaliesinAndEvitel is now live! Streaming World of Warcraft: Talking Cinematic Analysis and WoW News - Twitch's Most Boring Stream ***Not Clickbait ***
[0:01:28] Akaveary: Hola
[0:03:20] Aurora0044: Hello stream, how is everyone doing today?
[0:03:43] XettiPlays: Good you?
[0:04:18] Aurora0044: Exhausted but good otherwise
[0:06:11] YakSlacks: YakSlacks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! can you do an analysis on the hearthstone march of the lich king   cinematic plz/ty
[0:06:22] Awryn: weekly reset when? 0_0
[0:06:51] Andithus: Monday stream?
[0:07:17] Unconqueredfun: It does rather feel like monday
[0:07:32] leonardoh: Have they said anywhere if this twitch stream will qualify for the new wow twitch drops coming in a couple weeks?
[0:07:51] Unconqueredfun: If it doesn't I genuinely don't know what stream would
[0:08:06] honey_monkey: agree
[0:08:21] Quachiri: have to update my beta so I can see this updated login screen
[0:08:25] leonardoh: That's what I'm assuming but I never use twitch, watch all t&e on youtube, so setting all this up just for that :)
[0:08:44] lightforgedpally: Same
[0:08:55] Unconqueredfun: That's entirely fair. I imagine any channel who can regularly get 100+ viewers would have drops enabled if they're partnered.
[0:09:17] Unconqueredfun: But I do know Twitch will tell you if the stream you're watching is drops enabled
[0:09:21] lightforgedpally: But it looks like they do more on here than on YT so at least I get more Taliesin in my day
[0:09:30] brennibrennt: Even I have Drops enabled and I'm not even streaming anymore Kappa
[0:09:35] leonardoh: Since I'm chatting with other T&E fans, am I the only one who when I need a pick me up watches T's reaction video to Stony Tony being saved... just such joy in his eyes it always perks me up :)
[0:09:41] SirMorky: Collector's edition arrived today! LETS DO THIS FAM tneTayto tneStonyTony tneTayto tneStonyTony tneTayto tneStonyTony tneStonyTony tneTayto tneStonyTony tneTayto tneStonyTony tneTayto tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE

[0:12:02] Quachiri: @joetheredcoat it's been there since they first used this starter screen
[0:12:06] lightforgedpally: When the drops were announced it was like ‚Äúwelp, looks like T&E have a new watcher/subscriber‚Äù
[0:12:20] AsanoRan: tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE
[0:12:35] Kortinas: good mornin chat

[0:14:42] Ricohardt: 15th I believe
[0:14:47] bronioland: ah
[0:15:02] ProfSylvie101: I think they are all between phase II of pre patch and launch
[0:15:17] h3lyar: from 15th till 1st December I think
[0:15:22] kangaroostu: 2 slots.  15th-18th?  then 28th to 30th or 31st.  diff drop each time. Think there's a 3rd slot too
[0:15:23] mrswellrested: mrswellrested subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[0:15:29] leonardoh: Since I don't use twitch, what is "gifting" subscriptions... do I pick a channel and a person to give them to?  What if I don't know anyone else on twitch?
[0:16:02] ProfSylvie101: if you click gift a sub you can give to a specific person or a random person watching the stream
[0:16:03] carryondoctor: carryondoctor subscribed with Prime. 
[0:16:05] darthduk: You can just gift a random sub and it gives it to someone in chat
[0:16:09] Draxfur: @leonardoh you can choose to gift subs randomly on a channel to, you don't need to specify people to give the gift subs to
[0:16:13] Quachiri: that bit of Alexstraza on the  updated login screen on beta does a a bit to the look *watches it for a while during the wait*
[0:16:13] leonardoh: Oh that's cool then
[0:16:14] EighthEndless: there is an option under the video (it should be purple) called "gift a sub"
[0:16:30] leonardoh: I like the idea of giving it to someone who would want it
[0:16:34] piawak: T&E had the best hold/elevator music
[0:16:34] EighthEndless: you can gift a sub to the channel and it will be randomly assigne,d or you can gift to a specific person

[0:24:04] Lewmer: How did the sub drive for Evi' stream setup go last month buddy?
[0:24:05] vyseriax: Let's test the boy nipple theory
[0:24:08] brennibrennt: Stop gifting, drops only on Nov 15th!
[0:24:20] Prommien: Twitch still gets touchy about it.
[0:24:28] Felbones: nobbel works out now?

[0:24:30] JoeTheRedcoat: I heard tumblr just unbanned female presenting nipples.
[0:24:34] avohaj: you'd think the patriarchy would appreciate a female nipple, but no just prudes
[0:24:37] xBasicxWitchx: They did @JoeTheRedcoat !
[0:24:44] magemaster225: ask jdotb about it
[0:24:50] JoshMakesGames: being shirtless for men is fine ... getting shirtless on stream is a bit iffy.
[0:24:58] apixelops: Ahoy hoy
[0:25:00] xBasicxWitchx: The patriarchy is all about control.
[0:25:04] Unconqueredfun: Maybe you can get away with it if you cosplay the jailer too but don't quote me on that.
[0:25:10] Felbones: is it the patriarchy tho or the conservative women that force this?
[0:25:18] Felbones: or are they included in the patriarchy
[0:25:30] SirMorky: ü§£ü§£ü§£
[0:25:35] OneTrueKako: Letting women to go shirtless gives them a choice and that's a big nono under patriarchy
[0:25:36] ProfSylvie101: Hi Tali, do you have any recommendations for a first healer in WoW?
[0:25:41] lokyr5: lol
[0:25:47] HearthBits: Honestly not many people do have the shoulders to do Garrosh
[0:26:00] Unconqueredfun: You can cosplay his shadowlands appearance and put a pile of dust on screen
[0:26:02] pilco1990: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you think the jailer would've been a better character with nipple tassles?
[0:26:03] tandemshoehorns: A particularly difficult dungeon/raid may deserve nipple exposure.
[0:26:04] Fibnkak: @HearthBits i'm working on it
[0:26:04] Omogand: Choo Chooo HypeMwah
[0:26:17] Nulgar: I tried for the Tusks again today on 12 Plate Chars tneTaliCry

[0:26:34] Felbones: @Nulgar that's dedication
[0:26:41] Makaze78: Holypriest has basically 1 of everything in the toolkit
[0:26:44] Fibnkak: God don't be a shaman healer now we got all our buttons back. So if you want to get confused as helll shaman is your healer
[0:26:46] KamkazeV2: as a holy priest, I am offended
[0:26:50] azrael962000: yes Holy is the stereotypical healer
[0:26:53] leonardoh: @pilco1990 Thanks a lot, now I can't get that image out of my head :)

[0:28:53] Andithus: Did you see the nerfs to Disc?
[0:28:57] KibblesZA: original SF2, you could uppercut Blanka's roll and almost kill him, good old days
[0:29:07] Vodraalus: Evangelism up to 3 min CD from 1.5 min
[0:29:15] kolo_ttv: @TaliesinAndEvitel btw, we ended up going a bit more left here in Denmark

[0:29:24] Antiserumsx: thoughts on the new ESO Firesong DLC?
[0:29:30] brennibrennt: But how do you make the class/spec guides without knowing about the tuning? ^^
[0:29:34] Xx_Estos_xX: Street Fighter VS Mortal Kombat GO! TableHere FlipThis
[0:29:37] SirMorky: gotta say I've enjoyed playing around with the new talent trees tneTaliSelch
[0:29:47] Makaze78: @Vodraalus In Original SF II You could vacuum throw people mid air with ChunLi or Guile
[0:29:53] danathar_: Thoughts on the "second" cinematic in menu? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:30:00] Atomicpanda: tali do you think the 12 month sub should have been cheaper than the 6 month sub or is it fine? i think it should have saved another dollar
[0:30:06] bilzobob: I love Rep.
[0:30:12] DunesGames: Final Verdict is a fantastic animation
[0:30:20] WTFHali: Do you think dev evoker will be a hard class? My hubs thinks it‚Äôs going to difficult for ppl to grasp.

[0:30:41] SkyForged13: Tali do you think that Azeroth could be something other than a Worldsoul? After the players could access the First Ones portals in the Maw, it seems like it could be something else. Plus it didnt make sense for the Jailer to need Azeroth's power after he reached the SotFO
[0:30:45] The_Action_Man: but what about my hate boner?
[0:30:45] BigBarry1307: The tension between my Ret main friend and my DK main self is getting too high now with these talent trees

[0:30:56] azrael962000: I feel like the evokers should have a tank spec
[0:30:59] OneTrueKako: @TaliesinAndEvitel Honestly the first month of any wow expansion is great so even if dragonflight would become the worst expac you could still get your moneys worth that first month
[0:31:06] kangaroostu: @TaliesinAndEvitel has your Collectors Edition turned up?  I presume you ordered it!  Mine came this morning :)  Finally!
[0:31:13] gefuffel: I'm only here for the FFXIV content!
[0:31:25] SirMorky: @kangaroostu mine arrived today too woop! tneMovEEE
[0:31:46] Lewmer: ¬£40 to buy the xpac too, not just one month sub :(
[0:31:53] SirMorky: Preach quit didn't he? LUL LUL
[0:32:00] apixelops: "Didn't you say you were quitting"

[0:32:16] brennibrennt: We all will understand when these interviews release
[0:32:17] apixelops: tneHopium tneHopium tneHopium
[0:32:22] Thoreya: preach had a blast playing wow all day today lol
[0:32:23] pacmonkruzz: Lol back hardcore :)
[0:32:30] CapsuleCorpEmployee: LUL
[0:32:42] ebrahim_91: I have not ever been so hyped for Warcraft in a very long time, and I am in shock cause there is no Sylvanas involved LMAO
[0:32:46] covert7v: is dragon flight more casual player friendly - no more one shots in bg :)
[0:32:46] plopptart: tneTali
[0:32:56] BrainCleaner: we all know tali, we all know why he's back.

[0:33:02] apixelops: tneHopium tneMovEEE
[0:33:09] JarJar_Brinkz: Preach only likes DF because Ion gave him Pringles
[0:33:16] ebrahim_91: ohh I am sooo fucking hyped !
[0:33:18] halux_: hopium is perfectly safe
[0:33:20] lokyr5: I already miss her :(
[0:33:21] bladestitch: Dragons are always awesome.
[0:33:42] Lewmer: Resub when the xpac actually comes out, it's a bit quiet right now beside getting used to the talents
[0:33:43] azrael962000: halfway through sylvanus is gonna show up and say she finished up the maw
[0:33:49] bronioland: hey broski, thinking about renewing the subscription again for dragonflight but i dont know if i should wait or get it now. I already got one lvl 60 char and seems like I can play through most of the old expansions on my free lvl 20 druid so hmm
[0:33:51] Line_0: I hope that the patches give us loads of stuff to do because otherwise it might become boring with no systems
[0:33:52] kreten97: Copium
[0:33:53] apixelops: these are some EXTREMELE SAFE levels of Hopium
[0:33:54] Talieer: I think dragonflight focusing on the core mechanics and aspects of the game is succeeding in a way I only wished BfA had done
[0:33:57] Atomicpanda: is it worth a 12 month sub>
[0:34:13] OttoDeFe: And it has cool Tauren stealth animation.
[0:34:19] h3lyar: @atomicpanda ü§î
[0:34:21] Kieto313: finally connected zones again
[0:34:22] brennibrennt: "And for that one month, please buy the 1 year subscription. Thanks! Love, Blizzard"
[0:34:24] Nasarelor: Nasarelor subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:34:27] NeeK_23: NeeK_23 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months, currently on a 39 month streak! 40 months 2 kids, several homes and a wall built in that time
[0:34:33] BrainCleaner: any "triple AAA" game is about ¬£45 now, the exp and 1 month sub is 44.99, and will have 100's of hours more content than a normal AAA
[0:34:41] JarJar_Brinkz: Feels like the best talent trees to me
[0:34:42] elbardo_ts: @bronioland if you want to do the prepatch event or level up a drakthir, wait until it goes live, otherwise wait until it goes live
[0:34:45] stellar_sorcerer: It gives me wotlk vibes
[0:34:48] astralumi: true
[0:34:50] MrMoistToad: I just called to let you knowww. I got I think for u and I can't let gooo
[0:34:54] Thoreya: beta is more fun than SL ever was
[0:34:56] OneTrueKako: Legion was the start of the AP era
[0:35:01] Line_0: apparently the devs consider this a new era
[0:35:01] kreten97: @apixelops did you said safe?
[0:35:13] bladestitch: I mostly remember running around the Barrens during classic.
[0:35:14] AlanC2024: Indeed, Legion, BFA and SL is the last era. The AP era. Next one coming up
[0:35:20] bronioland: @elbardo_ts haha ok ill probably do that
[0:35:26] elbardo_ts: @bronioland i wrote it very poorly xD wait for prepatch if you want to do prepatch and level an evoker. Otherwise wait until the expansion is relased
[0:35:26] salvatorefortolino: woo liiive <3 just finished work, what we doing?
[0:35:32] conquestandvictory: Yup every 3 expansions a new era starts
[0:35:37] SirMorky: just give me my Tuskarr transmog and I'm good. That's end game for me. tneTali
[0:35:40] Nulgar: Apiera?
[0:35:40] amondiel: I'm sceptical. I won't return till I see Blizzard keeps their promises and don't change back in the next patch or expansion
[0:35:40] kangaroostu: It's because they ran out of things named AP so had to change
[0:35:46] chiseria27: the new dragonriding era hopefully!!!
[0:35:52] Talieer: last time I bought the physical copy of collector's was back in MoP
[0:36:00] Talieer: maybe it's time for it again...
[0:36:12] aeradrys: Just logged on for first time to mess with DH talents and I‚Äôm scared by the amount of buttons I have
[0:36:19] Line_0: I do that with ff14
[0:36:20] h3lyar: Tuskarr allied race please Blizz tneTali
[0:36:22] Madalynn: Hey tali, hows Swansea treating you and Evi
[0:36:26] aeradrys: *since pre-patch launch
[0:36:29] Sch1ey: first weeks of wow expansion is 100% the best time to play
[0:36:30] conquestandvictory: From my nerdy researching everything Dragonflight, i have a really good feel the expansion will get even better with the further patches (10.1, 10.2 etc)
[0:36:35] bladestitch: They miss the fun part of not getting into the game at launch.
[0:36:39] chiseria27: where's my aspect power??
[0:36:45] kreten97: I am fully high on copium
[0:36:47] Xx_Estos_xX: Tuskar Allied race for 12 month subs? KappaHD
[0:36:51] azrael962000: I want a murloc allied race
[0:36:59] Line_0: launch night is so fucking hype
[0:36:59] CapsuleCorpEmployee: Coming in late to an expansion is so daunting to me
[0:37:00] Emseypenguin: the social aspect in the first few weeks is the best
[0:37:02] h3lyar: @azrael962000 agreed
[0:37:02] elbardo_ts: as long as you don't mind about all the catch up you have to do if you come at the end of the expansion, go for it
[0:37:05] groovyboat: i didn't play SL until the end, but....it was meh
[0:37:10] Lewmer: I still disagree with the 6 weeks timegate to get quests and systems open. I understand with raid, but systems, no.
[0:37:17] lightforgedpally: SP guide please. That talent tree is crazy
[0:37:23] Madalynn: Love that for you guys, hope you are happy down there!
[0:37:27] bladestitch: Do your kids help or "help" fixing the house?
[0:37:31] azrael962000: they should be like tha panda though so they can choose alliance or horde
[0:37:35] salvatorefortolino: the brickwall?
[0:37:40] bronioland: @elbardo_ts oooh thjought that was on purpose
[0:37:41] Atomicpanda: nice. coming together is good.
[0:37:51] Mattysaiyan: Yea even if the expansion is ‚Äúbad‚Äù the first 2 weeks are a blast
[0:37:59] Quachiri: videos and twitch drops lol
[0:38:02] Tamz_tv: oh that is some nice wall
[0:38:18] salvatorefortolino: looks good Talli great job :)
[0:38:24] bitcoinonlyfans: New kid and carpets. You like to live dangerously @taliesinandevitel
[0:38:30] kangaroostu: Has there been a house tour?
[0:38:34] Atomicpanda: "brick slips" what's that a term for? lol sounds like something.
[0:38:44] h3lyar: @bitcoinonlyfans lmao too true!
[0:38:51] MrMoistToad: I can't wait for tali to give me my fel drake :)
[0:39:00] AlanC2024: One of the best things for me in a new expansion is the relief of not doing any alt grind / callings and I can focus on one character for a couple of weeks and relax while doing it. :D
[0:39:02] salvatorefortolino: have you found the lighting?
[0:39:27] NeeK_23: Tali whats you view on the idea that Azeroth the world soul is already corrupted and that finding out that nothing the aspects can do can prevent that and that the planets fate is fixed is what turns Nozdormu to Mura?
[0:39:36] Fibnkak: the graze
[0:39:38] Matahorn: Matahorn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[0:39:44] h3lyar: the hub lol
[0:40:04] dergNwolf: feldrake and dragon kite should be all streamers, purple fireworks and ichabod have weird wording that make it sound stupidly exclusive
[0:40:13] Pratypus: i think its so weird that there are now mounts in classic that dont exist in retail
[0:40:15] salvatorefortolino: yep good idea
[0:40:28] bronioland: @TaliesinAndEvitel whats the chain man? u got frodos ring around ur neck? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:40:34] gefuffel: wow.. can't believe Tali has the Tory website in his favorites...
[0:40:39] bronioland: oops double tag
[0:40:41] elsavate: Hey Tali how can I check when you go live?
[0:40:47] salvatorefortolino: definitely
[0:40:49] bronioland: oh lol
[0:40:56] ElyseMori: Tattoo reveal!
[0:41:00] bladestitch: News to me.
[0:41:00] Nulgar: @dergNwolf wait, Ichabod, too? Damn, that's weird...
[0:41:01] KamkazeV2: show us the tattoos!
[0:41:03] MissMoxzy: You have Frodo's rings tattooed on you?!
[0:41:04] anabelleigh0630: I forget you have them as well haha
[0:41:04] Crazyyelir: what?!
[0:41:06] h3lyar: any wow tattoos?
[0:41:07] cliche_cat: I... didn't expect you to have tatts
[0:41:09] SerasVallo: its true, you don't give off tattoo vibes
[0:41:27] brennibrennt: fulll chest and back tattoo :D
[0:41:27] c4rniv0re9273: we need a tattoo reveal stream
[0:41:28] candid_oak: we can't gain rested XP on our 60s now until the actual release of DF right?
[0:41:35] Talieer: that's a good approach
[0:41:35] gloomkid: is it bad if actors get tattoos? I always wondered
[0:41:35] Fibnkak: @TaliesinAndEvitel so we need a sub tattoo revile 6000 subs
[0:41:36] Reyoness: Sofa King
[0:41:37] Harper_n7: AHHHHHH that's how he got Evi... he was the British bad boy
[0:41:39] ProfSylvie101: next you will tell us your name is not Talisesin
[0:41:42] azrael962000: orange and grey compliment each other i think
[0:41:43] trshpndacmdr: you've gone and done it now, now one wants to hear the sofa chat and now want your tats XD
[0:41:44] Zaelsus: Only tuskar tattoos
[0:41:47] salvatorefortolino: right lol
[0:41:50] RealidLol: @TaliesinAndEvitel does the weather on the animated part of your broadcast (the window to the left of Evi playing) reflect the weather in your area?
[0:41:57] artisanhughes: show us your tats!
[0:42:03] sweargryllz: Two days in a row, you are spoiling me Talie <3
[0:42:06] ryarose42: did you find having tattoos made it harder to get acting jobs? my girlfriend wants tattoos but is concerned about making it hard for her to find work
[0:42:07] xirrizz: no, tattoo reviel is for the onlyfans channel
[0:42:12] elbardo_ts: next you will tell us you actually like coldplay
[0:42:29] gloomkid: is it bad if actors get tattoos? I always wondered
[0:42:36] stuckdr: I came here after a lecture on lighting and I see you looking at a lamp. I can't escape my lighting class
[0:42:43] Beppzy: Are they all prison tattoos?
[0:42:45] anabelleigh0630: Ugh. I miss getting tattoos. I want a new one haha
[0:42:47] netonkent: you've got a really big one ... nice
[0:42:52] SerasVallo: are they black and white or are they just black and you're the white?
[0:43:10] syncos2: @gloomkid Unless you're full of them, they're pretty easy to cover up depending on the role.
[0:43:12] MostGratuitous: Tali, I‚Äôm a museum/galllery lighting designer professionally. Do a lot of work with track light. Would be happy to do some design for you guys.
[0:43:14] Atomicpanda: mine are black and white and red all over.
[0:43:18] elbardo_ts: just watch a few electroboom videos and you'll know what to not do
[0:43:24] knokout64: Electricity fucks
[0:43:25] bladestitch: Fiddling with electricty is scary and stupid.
[0:43:25] Emseypenguin: You truly are a handy man
[0:43:27] danathar_: Thoughts about the new cinematic MrGM found in the menues? It's named "Dragonflight: Into the skies" @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:43:34] alumnia91: Very hungarian savvyness from you :D
[0:43:35] h3lyar: I agree, DIY everything...... electric....nope!!
[0:43:36] salvatorefortolino: less chance for domestic accident good choice
[0:43:41] azrael962000: yeah get that shit wrong your house burns down
[0:43:50] gloomkid: @syncos2 oh ok
[0:44:00] FaeyeLinn: Nobody ever died from touching the wrong part of the base boards...
[0:44:08] arthasblackstone: arthasblackstone subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! oh hey Hai missed you...im ready for dragonflight now.
[0:44:13] AlanC2024: For me its doing anything up a ladder. Can't do it. I have a fear of it. Not hights though
[0:44:17] syncos2: I've swapped fixtures and plugs and stuff, but would never add new electrics on my own.
[0:44:18] kangaroostu: What not RGB?!!!
[0:44:20] kreten97: Hey Tali What do you think about new Twitch drops???
[0:44:25] stuckdr: I'm just a interior architecture student. I just know basics rn
[0:44:28] kangaroostu: Disco Wall!
[0:44:28] skeletonetiquette: greetings Tali, how is the day going? already working on the next cinematic analysis?
[0:44:44] luckyener: My longstanding wish for WoW is Undead druid, think it will ever come true?
[0:44:50] elbardo_ts: I agree with the idea as long as we can use channel points to mess with your lights @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:44:55] BaldTheo: Hey Tali! love your videos thanks for making them
[0:45:03] MostGratuitous: 25 should be fine. I wouldn‚Äôt go narrower than that.
[0:45:06] syncos2: @luckyener That would be more akin to drust tho right?
[0:45:21] Fibnkak: So hyped you're playing on stream less and less
[0:45:23] Vixxel: Anyone else here keep calling in DragonLands? no, just me? okay..
[0:45:26] MostGratuitous: If you find it‚Äôs a little glary/spotty, I would put some light diffusion in front.
[0:45:27] JessiBear2115: Have you considered up lighting instead of down lighting. The couch would hide the lights and would give a nice effect
[0:45:37] arthasblackstone: @taliesinandevitel  I'm actually really enjoying the pre patch now. even if it is just talents and stuff.   but why are people so salty about the fel drake twitch drop?
[0:45:38] elbardo_ts: will there be a way to change your lights with channel points? tneEvi
[0:45:45] luckyener: @luckyener Well, I meant more like forsaken. I can assume there has to be at least 1 undead gilnean druid in their ranks
[0:45:46] AlpineHunterGSP: Dragontales? what?
[0:45:47] ZenjiBro: good morning Tali and chat
[0:46:06] sweargryllz: @Vixxel DragonLands or DragonStone. I have called it many things LUL
[0:46:18] skeletonetiquette: @zenjibro morning, how's the day?
[0:46:23] Atomicpanda: up lighting? down lighting? and here i'm stuck with mid lighting.
[0:46:26] RyleahStar: is is anny wow dragonflight content i have to watch or a specific channel? for the mounts.
[0:46:26] netonkent: I have to admit I'm do hyped for dragon flight but story wise I was so much more hyped for the start of stadowlands
[0:46:29] annizaki: annizaki subscribed with Prime. 
[0:46:30] azrael962000: azrael962000 converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:46:38] trshpndacmdr: sorry i've never joined you on your streams, glad I did today. I'm learning alot about lightning, thank you :P
[0:46:41] MostGratuitous: 2700 would look really good in person you might find it‚Äôs too warm for camera, though. Depends on your fronts. Will be *very* warm on the brick.
[0:46:49] salvatorefortolino: What do you think about the Uldum journal written by Tyr where he addresses his most trusted allies saying that once they reach their destination... smt smt but what do you think that destination was?
[0:47:05] annizaki: nope
[0:47:06] annizaki: :D
[0:47:11] jmj1987: jmj1987 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[0:47:15] annizaki: oh no, not my real name xD
[0:47:19] luckyener: @luckyener tbh I just want an excuse for Undead druid forms
[0:47:35] Nulgar: Tali, have you earned the Veilstrider title? If not, what's your progress?
[0:47:42] Haskins14780: hello Tali how are we today
[0:47:56] dwolf010: what do you think of the new cinametic added on beta? in the cinametic screen?
[0:47:57] azrael962000: they seem to be moving in the direction to allow all races to be all classes
[0:48:07] CottonEyeGoat: Uldorus?
[0:48:13] avohaj: didn't Tyr guide the "corrupted" Vrykul who became humans to Tirisfal? (aka Tyr's Fall)
[0:48:20] syncos2: Haven't been here in ages, as I've lost track of WoW news since quitting, but I have missed these just chatting streams.
[0:48:29] bilzobob: Isn't Uldorous TyrsHold?
[0:48:31] salvatorefortolino: thanks I was thinking if perhaps he was writing it to those 'deflectors' who went to Avalan?
[0:48:52] The_Action_Man: Ul'deeznuts?
[0:48:52] CottonEyeGoat: oh crap my bad!

[0:49:07] NeeK_23: good thing they were stolen, didnt want to have to borrow any power from a titan again tneTali
[0:49:26] groovyboat: never been to the titan waffle house...
[0:49:34] casssstellini: My new fav tin foil hat theory is that azeroth isn't actually a titan world soul but is something more powerful that we don't know about yet (given that everyone and their mother wants to eat it or use it and whatnot)
[0:49:38] KyleEverett: People already found old god eyes in the waters around the Isles
[0:49:40] bigoldmeatpie: the old god thing in wow is my favorite storyline. your prediction about the corruption has me so excited for hopeful old god stuff
[0:49:42] dwolf010: @TaliesinAndEvitel have you seen that they added an extra DF cinametic on the beta cinametic screen?
[0:49:44] Haskins14780: I can't stop listening to it lol
[0:49:47] HearthBits: 5:50
[0:49:49] Harsbo: 09:00 acoo
[0:49:54] Harsbo: according to youtube
[0:49:58] meth_aq: Would you be down for a revamped Ulduar?

[0:50:21] HearthBits: OK, thinking something else
[0:50:25] dwolf010: @TaliesinAndEvitel have you seen that they added an extra DF cinametic on the beta cinametic screen?

[0:51:23] TheDeekins: yeah your 760 managers wanna know why you aren't workin!
[0:51:23] dwolf010: @TaliesinAndEvitel have you seen that they added an extra DF cinametic on the beta cinametic screen?
[0:51:36] LGashly: LGashly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! I'm running out of funny things to say for these sub anniversaries, but I hope you're having a good one mate c:

[0:51:40] alextheblight: wooo, dragon kite!
[0:51:43] HearthBits: I learned something new today. I never knew it was called a nickel harp
[0:51:43] Fibnkak: Because you love to Procrastinate  that is why your here
[0:51:54] kangaroostu: Sorry Twitch removed formatting!
[0:52:04] Line_0: it's 29th for eu right?
[0:52:06] stellar_sorcerer: Oh yeah I love the music in howling fjord
[0:52:06] LGashly: I'm glad I can still impress ^.^

[0:52:26] poxbourne: poxbourne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Happy Wednesday stream!
[0:52:29] Line_0: but like an hour before LUL
[0:52:35] KyleEverett: the firework must be RWF people
[0:52:41] kangaroostu: correct - "select Wow channels" good spot :)
[0:52:45] palco2013: watch talie
[0:52:53] YayFiber: @KyleEverett that would make sense
[0:53:00] salvatorefortolino: where do you release your class guides?
[0:53:05] salvatorefortolino: publish*
[0:53:12] danathar_: @dwolf010 keep asking :D
[0:53:13] palco2013: it gonna be Preach because reasons
[0:53:23] Durwen: Streamers don't know who is "select" or not as of yet?
[0:53:25] apixelops: it's kinda interesting that they chose the Eternal Purple Fireworks (a WotLK era WoWTCG item themed on the Kirin Tor)... plus that Hearthstone's expansion is so heavily Lich king themed, wouldn't it make more sense to have more "Dragon" stuff?
[0:53:27] Talieer: don't forget the Ichabod pet
[0:53:30] palco2013: of course he did
[0:53:31] YayFiber: Would be cool if it was exclusively small streamers
[0:53:32] brennibrennt: that's not how you spell devastated
[0:53:34] Lazzouli: LUL
[0:53:37] Marach: @hearthbits Nyckelharpa
[0:53:38] lokyr5: LOL

[0:53:53] onetoughkitty: Lol he was playing live today
[0:53:54] netonkent: preach has too much ethics
[0:53:55] Immortale_G: preach ended his end of an era
[0:53:55] Zaelsus: Even Ion said he quit last week! LUL Kappa
[0:53:57] h3lyar: tneTali tneTali

[0:54:09] kaijoe_: A fully rendered one!
[0:54:10] DozlaT: or ion starts streaming and it's him
[0:54:10] apixelops: No, there's a thumbnail for an actual new one
[0:54:12] halux_: there is room there for 4 more dragons just saying
[0:54:13] alextheblight: MrGM tweeted about it
[0:54:14] palco2013: that pretty cool
[0:54:16] lucabav0: Preach is confirmed that he is coming back to play WoW got dragonflight

[0:55:00] salvatorefortolino: maybe he watched your vids and got infected with the enthusiasm ;)
[0:55:08] alextheblight: yep, he feels Blizz is taking the game in the right direction
[0:55:14] kreten97: Preach left the chat
[0:55:15] Madalynn: in all honesty he never quit, what he said was he wasnt going to be covering wow news on his channel going forward.  He still played with friends on raid nights
[0:55:16] Line_0: yeah a new cgi cinematic isn't usual is it?
[0:55:18] lucabav0: agreed, I am excited for DF.
[0:55:21] AlpineHunterGSP: good for the community?
[0:55:21] NeeK_23: his quit video even said he'd return if they improved in his opinion, only people who saw only the headline thought he was gone
[0:55:22] jmj1987: Preach is clearly a sellout
[0:55:27] syncos2: Unrelated to WoW, Ted Lasso followed by Welcome to Wrexham has made me care about Footie, and that makes me sad.
[0:55:28] SirMorky: Pahahaha fair.
[0:55:35] lucabav0: hahahaha truuuuue
[0:55:36] honey_monkey: agree
[0:55:40] KyleEverett: "Dragonflight: To the Skies" is in the cinematic lists
[0:55:42] avohaj: it is your DUTY
[0:55:48] eb_farnum: @jmj1987 sellout? It's a game, not a duty.
[0:55:53] salvatorefortolino: yea it's about HOW you do your exit :)
[0:55:53] Oracle_WoW: Start of a new Era!

[0:56:17] netonkent: I think I would have cried if you did a leaving wow video
[0:56:22] Graffis101: you wouldn't let it lie... (reeves and Mortimer)
[0:56:24] Antstar12: he should make an end of an era video with a montage of him not playing wow
[0:56:24] honey_monkey: This is better stream.  appreciate the analysis and good commentary
[0:56:26] SirMorky: wonder how many clicks it got. well played tneTaliCry LUL
[0:56:37] salvatorefortolino: exactly
[0:56:47] SpacedemonX: Preach is the Tom Brady of wow.  Retires one season, comes back the next.
[0:56:48] Talieer: don't say anything, if you change your mind say it was a break
[0:56:53] bladestitch: Don't strain your pc and get BSOD again.
[0:56:57] Morri_4u: He's British too and expects no less  :)
[0:57:04] fathomlordcrunch: do a leaving the room video
[0:57:08] leonardoh: Lol, I could just see a crying potato saying he was done :)
[0:57:13] Thoreya: preach was getting ready to gear his warrior today and to start sepulcher soon lol
[0:57:15] Fibnkak: but it isn't better to burn out the fade away
[0:57:17] syncos2: Anyone who plays wow knows the likelihood of quitting 10,000 times. So a video commemorating it is silly

[1:02:48] bladestitch: Should be optional.
[1:02:49] leonardoh: I didn't like it at first but when they explained it goes to people who also like watching you, it's all good.
[1:02:50] Ellycat1: I didn't like it when SE did it either honestly. It feels wrong.
[1:02:50] Quachiri: thankfully they didn't do it to the fel drake
[1:02:50] JarJar_Brinkz: @dwolf010 different people?
[1:02:50] jmj1987: spending money DansGame
[1:03:02] Haskins14780: hey bud you have to make a living to and you do what you love
[1:03:03] kaijoe_: Makes me feel better about supporting smaller streamers.
[1:03:09] kangaroostu: I saw a gift subs for FFIV and it really put me off a major streamer because they were basically encouraging people to gift like mad.
[1:03:25] chocossimo: The extra money will help you finish the brick wall
[1:03:28] fathomlordcrunch: it feels weird like good and bad
[1:03:29] Zaelsus: It's about the same cost as buying it from the blizz store, but still awkward for those who can't afford or don't want to buy the stuff
[1:03:37] Zilas11: Zilas11 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Good morning, fam
[1:03:37] halux_: when does it start?
[1:03:37] Ellycat1: Will you be part of the gifting campaign Tali? If you can say.
[1:03:38] Xx_Estos_xX: Hey guys, have you heard @taliesinandevitel  just quit wow? Proof! ***‚ÄîQEvO14NswN0YEf1
[1:03:39] AlpineHunterGSP: i get that, but i feel like its Blizzard getting their community to support their content creators. double edged
[1:03:44] Luchifae: The difference being here you'd give 10 bucks to a streamer instead of blizzard, but won't be able to buy it with a wow token
[1:03:53] DozlaT: imagine if they asked people to sub for the fel drake lol
[1:03:55] Haskins14780: yes I'll be watching for sure
[1:03:59] JarJar_Brinkz: Twitch marketing is a really big player now
[1:03:59] Line_0: in my mind it's just disconnected from the other free drops so I don't really mind. Same as buying from store
[1:04:00] netonkent: so you have morales now?? you didn't quit in 9.1 ..üòùüòùüòù
[1:04:06] Talieer: imagine being one of the people who bought the mount tho
[1:04:06] valeor38: i cant wait to use dragonriding with the new feldrake, that looks AWESOME /j
[1:04:06] JarJar_Brinkz: WoW has been way behind for a long time
[1:04:08] Vidaloo: No it's doesn't anymore @TaliesinAndEvitel , they changed it just today
[1:04:13] FaeyeLinn: T did, not E.
[1:04:14] Morri_4u: only T quitted, E did not
[1:04:16] bronioland: bye guys imma go out wit m,e broskis have a good time this is the end of an era
[1:04:27] DozlaT: good ol daddy bezos
[1:04:31] groovyboat: do i have to have a wow sub to get the drake drop? or can i get the drop and sub later
[1:04:32] xirrizz: what is the % that goes to streamers?
[1:04:32] skewlbeta: the T might be gone. E is forever.
[1:04:40] azrael962000: should rename the stream "triumphant return to WoW"
[1:04:42] Ellycat1: I can't wait to never use the feldrake danLUL
[1:04:47] bladestitch: 3 seconds at the time. :)
[1:04:54] Harai_Ulfsark: @groovyboat you can get the drop and sub later
[1:04:57] Vidaloo: As in it still is a drop but not on the 15th but from the 28th til Dec 1st
[1:05:03] stellar_sorcerer: I don‚Äôt like looking at like 2012 WoW textures so I don‚Äôt want the fel drake lol
[1:05:04] Osaril: I do feel like that the fel drake is the right choice for an expansion about dragons
[1:05:07] DozlaT: God look at malygos
[1:05:07] Line_0: oooh
[1:05:10] bigoldmeatpie: malygos looks so good
[1:05:10] AsanoRan: panick!
[1:05:11] Quachiri: that means we get a first look ;P
[1:05:12] KamkazeV2: You're on stream today because you're going to paly the fresh start servers on New World, aren't you?
[1:05:13] AlpineHunterGSP: do it live?
[1:05:18] AlpineHunterGSP: hell yeah
[1:05:18] Atomicpanda: tneTayto can't wait to watch potato dance for a mount tneTayto
[1:05:18] annizaki: woop
[1:05:20] Line_0: I'm in
[1:05:22] salvatorefortolino: woo
[1:05:25] Rantsuu: I can't get over Malygos, he looks so good
[1:05:25] Emseypenguin: oh cool!
[1:05:25] sheepwipe: fuck it, we'll do it live
[1:05:25] Zilas11: yay
[1:05:27] annizaki: so here for it
[1:05:29] bladestitch: Cool. Getting my tea and cookies.
[1:05:31] Emseypenguin: no fomo on this channel
[1:05:35] Dintory: nice, free preview
[1:05:41] xirrizz: recorded with a live studio audience
[1:05:41] elbardo_ts: and if it doesn't turn good, you can put it on the clips channel tneEvi
[1:05:41] Zaelsus: Would you rather give the pet money to the Bezosbag or the bank of Kotick? cohhHmm
[1:05:46] xirrizz: and laugh track
[1:05:46] Wirhl: So what you're saying is you're going to WING IT!!!!  YEAH WING IT BABY!!!!
[1:05:48] Zilas11: mama mia
[1:05:49] Haskins14780: so we are only getting 3 of these?
[1:05:53] gmac1982: You‚Äôre slacking on your painting I see, or is the splotches the final design? üòÅ
[1:05:57] Anthy1887: danP
[1:05:58] ProfSylvie101: that sounds fun
[1:05:59] Xx_Estos_xX: Wait, the 4 hour potato dance stream is really happening?! tneTali tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE
[1:06:01] kameleon0728: streamatic analysis you can say
[1:06:07] ProfSylvie101: is it part of the build up to a certain castle?
[1:06:13] elbardo_ts: wait, who?
[1:06:14] skeletonetiquette: don't blame you first one was 40 minutes, absolute monster of a video, doing another back to back basically is just intense
[1:06:16] AsanoRan: gluYay gluYay gluYay
[1:06:16] Atomicpanda: uh oh. i better up my game if i want to make it into the video. tneDorkthyr
[1:06:18] Andithus: Fremily are sick mate
[1:06:24] Ulashtlove: tneDorkthyr tneDorkthyr tneDorkthyr
[1:06:26] Harai_Ulfsark: oh so thats what mrgm is doing today
[1:06:31] NiteOwl11617: Jaina Warbringers was epic
[1:06:32] Xeby17: Elf Malygos looks so cool
[1:06:43] Kyferus: this cinematic pretty much confirms Murozond, but yes not very hype
[1:06:46] Wirhl: These cinematics are totally full of Lorecraft :)
[1:06:48] grimetotem: We'll never get any as good as the Jaina cinematic
[1:06:48] Haskins14780: Tali teach me the ways of warcraft lol
[1:06:50] Mathavian: I was here for T&E‚Äôs FIRST cinematic analysis since their return to WoW.
[1:06:52] Zaelsus: So far this has been fairly ominous
[1:06:53] skeletonetiquette: I think it's pretty hype honestly
[1:07:07] AlpineHunterGSP: we need a dracthyr doing an iron man landing, crazy epic music, and underdog going bad ass
[1:07:09] dem0sin: why are mommy dragons wearing so much clothes?
[1:07:13] TK241: @TaliesinAndEvitel i mean as a dragonophile i think these are super hype
[1:07:15] dday_movies: The Jaina warbringer was an insanely cool video holy god
[1:07:16] Zaelsus: Not yet, we can hope
[1:07:18] Ellycat1: I liked the SL cinematics a lot more but these are fine.
[1:07:22] Lenitas: Warbringers Jaina was very special though
[1:07:24] annizaki: exciteeeeeeed
[1:07:33] weapon000: that's interesting.  I don't think I've ever seen Malygos' humanoid form.
[1:07:33] salvatorefortolino: @skeletonetiquette I was thinking the same when I realised now i need to wait 1 week to learnt that ONE MOMENT IN TIME
[1:07:51] Bamboozl: tneTali tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE
[1:08:06] Tigerlilium08: I introduced one of my coworkers to wow and he's been really enjoying these because it gives him story he doesn't know.
[1:08:17] skeletonetiquette: @salvatorefortolino right?!
[1:08:17] NiteOwl11617: After seeing the Emberthal concept art from these, I want a second pass at dracthyr customization.
[1:08:44] neleaza: i find it interesting that Ysera is the only aspect to take on the visage of a nightelf, everyone else look like highborn
[1:08:45] salvatorefortolino: @skeletonetiquette right :)
[1:08:46] Haskins14780: get him Dawn of the Aspects book also
[1:08:55] aeradrys: I‚Äôm excited for these as their own things, I‚Äôm here for the ghost of Christmas past seeing things we know about
[1:09:04] valeor38: evi thinks wows gone soft confirmed
[1:09:07] Atomicpanda: they're nice. i just wish the art and "animation" looked better. i mean, they're not bad.
[1:09:45] kameleon0728: So we blame steve danuser ?
[1:09:56] salvatorefortolino: @skeletonetiquette what do you think it is?
[1:09:59] ewannorton: @kameleon0728 lol
[1:10:03] Kyferus: the end hints Murozond sooooo hard
[1:10:20] annizaki: we love a good conspiracy theory
[1:10:22] weapon000: You can tell this happened awhile ago because Alexastra and Ysera don't have their high level raid gear.  crendorSkittles
[1:10:25] Tigerlilium08: @kameleon0728 Don't we always?
[1:10:36] Bird_Years: My question about the cinematic is, why can't time dudes ever answer questions in a straight way?
[1:10:39] Lerosyl: Yes!!
[1:10:48] annizaki: that would be mega cool
[1:11:00] Lerosyl: Never trust someone with a beard like that!
[1:11:02] Durwen: I love seeing Plato's myrh of the Cavern parallels in these cinematics. And they support Murozond's theory
[1:11:04] gurkenglashalbvoll: but why?
[1:11:08] Haskins14780: your making me sad üòî
[1:11:09] CottonEyeGoat: You can hear his voice changing more "dark" at the end of episode 1
[1:11:13] CottonEyeGoat: 2 i mean
[1:11:14] grimetotem: I think it's Nozdormu putting a contingency in place for when he does turn
[1:11:18] Lenitas: Is Anakin Darth Vader?
[1:11:22] Haskins14780: I dont want to kill Nozdormu
[1:11:34] salvatorefortolino: have you gone back to check the eyes of Murozind versus this visage eyes?
[1:11:35] Line_0: After this video I think it's nozdormu enlisting the dracthyr to help kill him now
[1:11:42] Kyferus: i disagree with that, i think this is him but its hinting at him about to learn the truth and become Murozond
[1:11:48] Qustav: @ishreku1v1m8 semantics, it only changes the context and his goals
[1:11:52] apixelops: I find that he might TURN into Murozond on the 3rd cinematic because he does mention he can't see a SPECIFIC moment in time and that he hopes the Dracthyr will help him - what if that moment, is what turns him?
[1:11:53] netonkent: accolonn had a interesting theory. that episode 3 might be him seeing his death
[1:12:01] beeplaced: not scary if that is Murozond
[1:12:05] Ellycat1: That's what I'm thinking
[1:12:07] Line_0: yeah same
[1:12:07] skeletonetiquette: I think the moment in time he needs to see is when the drakthyr were made, how they made
[1:12:15] Lerosyl: I think 2 options: Either Nozdormu wants to seek his salvation, or pursues his own damnation.
[1:12:17] gurkenglashalbvoll: I still think that's just Nozdormu who wants to figure out how he becomes Murozond
[1:12:26] Kyferus: i agree with that for sure now
[1:12:28] Tonyalaska: don't we see nozdormu at the end of the forbidden reach intro and these take place right before the dracthyr wake up?
[1:12:29] Durwen: The problem I see is that he's not actually lying. Being biased, yes. Misleading, yes. Lying, not so much.
[1:12:36] apixelops: He wants to see a specific moment that SOMEHOW has been denied to him, his death? perhaps, something sinister about the Titans that will break his faith?
[1:12:36] salvatorefortolino: but his death he has already seen, he said it's a moment that was hidden
[1:12:37] Zaelsus: I'm thinking it's either Murozond coming back in time to pull one over, or it's Nozdormu at the point where he's becomming Murozond. Can't recall if he can see the point where he makes the changeover (aka the thing he needs Emberthal to see for him)
[1:12:41] Trebled_Mind: Hot take: Murozond like the Doctor‚Äôs Valiard regeneration
[1:12:45] Solstrike06: From the trailer clips, we know that episode 3 will involve the dracthyr's story somehow
[1:12:48] Silvechi: in a glorious timey wimey thing, this might be murozond causing nozdormu to become him
[1:12:51] xirrizz: no we will team up with Murozond against the Titans
[1:13:04] shunko_ffxiv: The blue tint to his eyes makes me think it is Murozond
[1:13:06] bladestitch: Blindeside us and it's neither Nozdormu or Murozond, just someone pretending.
[1:13:10] NiteOwl11617: The time travel questline was my favorite.
[1:13:10] Line_0: he says that emberthal will have to make the same decision that the aspects once made. Which to me sounds like he wants them to kill him once he becomes murozond just like they had to kill deathwing @taliesinandevitel
[1:13:18] Kyferus: im thinking primalist first patch, BIg dragon .2 patch and Murozond for end of expansion
[1:13:21] gurkenglashalbvoll: I still hope it's Yogg-Saron or C'thun that corrupt Nozdormu into Murozond
[1:13:24] aeradrys: Perhaps it‚Äôs the lead into the next xpac, he falls during this one
[1:13:27] Rionne_tw: So it would make sense that we fight Murozond "now" in Dragonflight, but he escapes to "End Time" timeline and we finally defeat him there then
[1:13:38] jmalmin: I have a feeling this is the real deal.. Because Murozond would have shown the dragonkin something very different to trick them into his side. He would not have shown Deathwing. or just shown the death.
[1:13:49] valeor38: murozond last boss?
[1:14:05] AlpineHunterGSP: what if... what if... his corruption leads to the void expansion >.>
[1:14:12] Brittnee1188: Brittnee1188 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:14:14] Ellycat1: I think he might snap if he finds out the truth about the titans tbh.
[1:14:14] CottonEyeGoat: @valeor38  i dont think Murozond will be the last boss, more like gul'dan or azshara
[1:14:15] Durwen: Sure, let's do this live. What could possibly go wrong?
[1:14:18] Silvechi: I'm still thinking about the conspiracy theory you read from wowhead about the primus being the baddy >.>
[1:14:31] apixelops: I mean, if there's a villain that can cause all sorts of future xpack shenigans, it's Murozond  What if he brings back the Black Empire by literally time travelling and folding it into our timeline
[1:14:36] Talieer: yes
[1:14:36] Durwen: yes
[1:14:36] apixelops: yes
[1:14:36] salvatorefortolino: yes
[1:14:36] thinkoutsidetheBoex: yeah

[1:14:43] Ellycat1: It's very loud
[1:14:43] beandohh: yessir
[1:14:43] Lerosyl: in Endtime, we kill Murozond in Dragonblight. Dragonblight has been a huge theme in these cinematics. Clue?
[1:14:43] Honorbean: louud
[1:14:44] Quachiri: yep
[1:14:45] palco2013: why ding
[1:14:45] AlpineHunterGSP: tes
[1:14:46] xirrizz: huuuurt
[1:14:46] valeor38: that ding broke my ears
[1:14:46] Tigerlilium08: very very loud
[1:14:46] salvatorefortolino: YES
[1:14:47] EighthEndless: its very very loud yea
[1:14:51] gloomkid: my cat hates the ding

[1:15:00] skoxxinator: a bit louder pls
[1:15:00] BertTheFrenchy: Really quiet now
[1:15:01] Lenitas: Much better, but maybe too low
[1:15:02] Mathavian: Big yikes
[1:15:03] apixelops: too low
[1:15:03] JessiBear2115: Because the Dracthyr have all 5 dragon flights within them, the birthplace of the Dracthyr can be used in reverse to make an aspect. The Dracthyr are the key
[1:15:04] EighthEndless: split the difference maybe
[1:15:04] Estralmage: not too low thats good
[1:15:05] palco2013: it fine
[1:15:06] Mathavian: Owwwww
[1:15:07] Nulgar: too low
[1:15:07] Durwen: a bit louder

[1:15:10] Wirhl: nice and intimately soft
[1:15:13] beandohh: perfect

[1:15:21] salvatorefortolino: perfect
[1:15:22] Ulashtlove: perf
[1:15:25] Nulgar: tbh it was just barely too loud the first time
[1:15:26] DragnosiOfNede: thumbs up
[1:15:27] doon03: Blues clues!!!
[1:15:28] Silvechi: still thinking about the conspiracy theory you read from wowhead about the primus being the baddy >.>
[1:15:28] blue_eyes769: perfect
[1:15:29] jmalmin: Ding... rom service!
[1:15:34] Lenitas: Just below too loud
[1:15:34] EighthEndless: i love it lololol

[1:15:46] Mathavian: Stay there
[1:15:51] palco2013: mhhh intriguing
[1:15:53] doon03: Good
[1:15:55] EighthEndless: ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE TALI
[1:15:58] ebrahim_91: thats a good catch
[1:16:02] salvatorefortolino: can you bring up a pic of Mur
[1:16:17] Spykadelic: I feel that you should invest in a tin foil hat for these, would add to the atmosphere
[1:16:18] blue_eyes769: ding
[1:16:21] Ellycat1: God nozdormu is so hot danBlush
[1:16:24] Babyspinat: DING!
[1:16:31] azrael962000: TwitchLit TwitchLit TwitchLit TwitchLit
[1:16:32] Quachiri: hope all your sounds are coming through on the same output
[1:16:38] Nulgar: nono, Yntrige is the German name of the black dragon Malice
[1:17:04] salvatorefortolino: overstylized yes
[1:17:11] groovyboat: dragons are shiny...they glitter....glitter! this is what's happening to all the glitter !!
[1:17:17] TrashmasterRihi: Wouldn't these cinematics take place before/during the Dracthyr starting zone stuffs? Or would this be Murozond going back in time to chat with Emberthal?
[1:17:34] rws26: Murozond may not be bad as well, he could be a genuine player guide character, final cinematic leading to you being left with the question what happened leading up to endtime with him.
[1:17:40] azrael962000: for real this is The Last Supper with dragons
[1:17:43] rws26: He's not a clearly bad character
[1:17:45] grimetotem: Judas!
[1:17:46] ChuckleButty: @TaliesinAndEvitel But he says in the most recent one that 'The sands of time do not lie'. So this is surely just 'factual' representation?
[1:18:07] salvatorefortolino: agreed
[1:18:14] blue_eyes769: what if the tians turn him evil what if he uncovers a titan secret and they betray him and thats part of why he doesnt show them
[1:18:18] AlpineHunterGSP: yeah... dragons never lie
[1:18:31] bladestitch: What would be Murozonds interest in the Dracthyr?
[1:18:36] Nulgar: ALL TRUTHS
[1:18:36] Harsbo: I'm in the process of convinsing myself that the 5 dragons' "spark of intelligence" is actually a product of Old God intervention. If Galakrond was a product of Old God experimenting, why couldn't the 5 also be affected by Old God influence? And this could be what Odyn is referencing when he talks about the advanced achievements of the Old Gods.
[1:18:36] ebrahim_91: I am so anti titans
[1:18:37] TK241: just dont tell you everything colaFingies
[1:18:46] EighthEndless: what if nozdormu was always just a front, and he was really murazond all along!  because, ya know, time?
[1:19:01] skeletonetiquette: the most important line in the entire series for me is trust your eyes, when we know we can't because he can show whatever he wants. Immediate red flag.
[1:19:07] OrganicPasta: I think they're playing into the "pride before the fall" kind motif
[1:19:09] groovyboat: i confess....i'm titanphobic
[1:19:17] blue_eyes769: snap camera very sexxy
[1:19:17] HastetheDavid444: snap camera
[1:19:24] blue_eyes769: looking goos
[1:19:25] apixelops: snap camera
[1:19:26] bladestitch: Your camera doesnt like you.
[1:19:28] Quachiri: snap filter again
[1:19:37] BertTheFrenchy: oh snap
[1:19:37] siegeorc: Mmm... what a snap camera!
[1:19:38] Tigerlilium08: Oh no, not again. I hope the stream doesn't drop like yesterday
[1:19:40] AlpineHunterGSP: actually gone
[1:19:43] EighthEndless: @bladestitch or it really likes him and wants him to play with its plug lolol
[1:19:45] apixelops: the secret does come out, tali internet man uses Snap Camera
[1:19:47] salvatorefortolino: @ChuckleButty I think we are getting to the point where he doesn't actually take us to that moment in time, he recreates it for us and Emberthal so it could be whatever he wants it to be
[1:19:50] thunduz: you broke it
[1:19:55] Babyspinat: Time to sell snapchat stocks
[1:20:00] BertTheFrenchy: Typical IT comment: "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
[1:20:02] HastetheDavid444: chonk
[1:20:02] Talieer: This is all proof tali is onto something
[1:20:02] Faelicitas: RIP
[1:20:03] Morticia24: audio was not syncing before the camera went out
[1:20:03] Zaelsus: Blizz have a direct line to the camera and are trying to stop you from revealing their expansion plotline @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:20:08] bladestitch: BSOD incoming...
[1:20:15] Nulgar: Titan Hit Squad took out Tali's camera
[1:20:17] palco2013: uh
[1:20:19] BertTheFrenchy: It's back!
[1:20:22] BertTheFrenchy: Oh
[1:20:23] EighthEndless: CAMERA WATCHING THE CAMERA
[1:20:25] BertTheFrenchy: Wrong camera
[1:20:26] AlpineHunterGSP: thats what she said
[1:20:46] salvatorefortolino: dang you have to do this manually every time?
[1:20:48] MDSouleater: Can't both Murozond and Norzdomu exist at the same time as Murozond exists outside of time itself?
[1:20:55] Honorbean: Question; is this correct?: At least initially, whether Nozdormu's fate was inevitable seems to have been unclear. Nozdormu stated that the End Time was not an "inevitable" future, Alurmi adds afterwards that the End Time was overwritten as a timestrand, and Alexstrasza in her post-Cataclysm meeting with Nozdormu and others confirms that they "had altered that future forever", thereby erasing his responsibility for Murozond. Chronicle Vol. 3 however stated that Nozdormu's fate was "inescapable"?
[1:20:55] BertTheFrenchy: Nice workaround xD
[1:21:10] apixelops: @MDSouleater Absolutely, because they exist simultaneously in the End Times fight
[1:21:22] palco2013: did we see malygos form before?
[1:21:26] beandohh: DING
[1:21:28] degnomiak: it's basiscally a fancy powerpoint with nice transitions
[1:21:28] palco2013: human
[1:21:29] FriendMorf: DING
[1:21:31] apixelops: @palco2013 Only in Hearthstone
[1:21:32] Honorbean: *taken from the wiki btw
[1:21:35] timeninja888: DING
[1:21:38] palco2013: oh nice
[1:21:39] Talieer: am I watching breaking bad, can't tell
[1:21:41] ChuckleButty: @ChuckleButty I'm 100% up for a bit of cheekiness, but I feel these cinematics, from a marketing point of view, are to catch people up on a story that started a few years before a lot of the playerbase joined, rather than to be a major *gasp* moment in themselves.
[1:21:46] thunduz: we hear nothing
[1:21:53] Lenitas: No video audio
[1:21:56] salvatorefortolino: @Honorbean I'd love to bump this question
[1:21:57] palco2013: once
[1:21:59] im_hugou: did u play something?
[1:22:01] Babyspinat: @Talieer I got the reference *ding*
[1:22:06] Atomicpanda: no audio from the video.
[1:22:07] AlpineHunterGSP: no video audio
[1:22:07] LGashly: it was real quiet chat but you COULD Hear it
[1:22:13] raylse: I guess time-wise we don't know where the launch cinematic vs legacies take place, but it looks like nozdormu in non-murazond form in the launch cinematic? ***
[1:22:17] thunduz: LOL
[1:22:20] Anthy1887: LUL
[1:22:21] palco2013: ding
[1:22:30] thunduz: solid point
[1:22:38] lokyr5: I had audio
[1:22:39] Harsbo: @Honorbean It is "inescabable" that Nozdormu becomes Murozond, but the End Time scenario cannot happen anymore. It's two different events
[1:22:40] Kyferus: as far as i know what they lost is immortality,
[1:22:42] RealSolaroid: Did you get your Dragonflight Collectors Edition? Mine has just arrived! :)
[1:22:48] Nulgar: it's *Time* magic, not *Aspect* magic
[1:22:50] DragnosiOfNede: He does clarify that the power they lost was their immortality.
[1:22:51] Silvechi: maybe they have and this is literally *the* hint >.>
[1:22:55] Spykadelic: Does he use 'aspect powers' specifically? Chromie can show us the past too
[1:23:15] AlanC2024: In the revamped uldaman dungeon its hinted that the aspects are looking to get thier power back
[1:23:23] Kyferus: @Spykadelic good point
[1:23:24] Talieer: Or did nozdormu do a batman/iron man and not lend all his power to have a backup plan if someone turns evil again, paving the path for him becoming murozond?
[1:23:46] ChuckleButty: I feel like Murozond is key to the Aspects getting their power back. Because in End Time, the Aspects had their full powers, and if he DOES transform into Murozond, that means the aspects have their full powers again.
[1:23:47] Sch1ey: dont we still refer to the flights in game @taliesinandevitel
[1:23:54] Honorbean: @Harsbo so basically branch in the timeline happens when he becomes Murozond, but our timeline wont lead to the endtimes anymore?
[1:24:09] Harsbo: @Honorbean Exactly, as far as I understand
[1:24:14] bladestitch: What does he want with the Dracthyr then?
[1:24:21] Tigerlilium08: Perhaps, they're working on filling all five seats of the aspects, because they really only have their full power when every aspect is covered. Sort of like without one, the power seeps away in the gap of power.
[1:24:32] apixelops: @ChuckleButty What if Murozond's empowerment into the Leader of the INFINITE flight comes from someplace else? Not the Titans but either a Primal Force or... the Old Gods?
[1:24:40] Kyferus: i think his fate is set in stone while dracthyr for some reason are not
[1:24:42] grimetotem: If you have the power over time, you are immortal regardless right?
[1:25:01] Talieer: a little bit low
[1:25:04] BertTheFrenchy: Low
[1:25:05] DragnosiOfNede: Technically that line of his story is already written, backs up he's already Murazond.  The Infinite Dragonflight had a massive army, is this the beginning of him building it?
[1:25:13] halux_: turn on captions, it helps
[1:25:24] meister_reinecke: a bit low
[1:25:35] Spykadelic: It is just manner Tali, it would be rude otherwise
[1:25:39] thunduz: lol rip
[1:25:41] AlpineHunterGSP: well that go dark
[1:25:45] AlpineHunterGSP: got*
[1:25:50] Spykadelic: *manners
[1:25:53] ChuckleButty: Chromie would know her name
[1:25:55] Abruhcadabro: Anyone know who Nozzy's new voice actor is? I'm getting Josh Brolin/Thanos vibes from him
[1:25:57] DonCuzu: Might be testing if Ember knows it her/himself (dno)
[1:25:59] FriendMorf: might just want to make sure the being is coherent?
[1:26:00] Solstrike06: I feel like he was just giving her an opportunity to introduce herself, for the friendliness? idk
[1:26:01] apixelops: He did see it but he hasn't done it yet, simple
[1:26:01] Kyferus: or they did but knew the alternative was worse Kappa
[1:26:02] timeninja888: he could just be being polite
[1:26:02] mrfiddleswitch: unless they exist out of time maybe?
[1:26:03] RahnaRocks: RahnaRocks subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 34 months! Love this channel tneEviHeart
[1:26:04] dwolf010: didnt the dragons not know about the dractyr @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:26:07] Harsbo: I think we can go even further than the Murozond theory. I think we can start talking about dragons being Old God creatons, or at least that their initial superior intelligence was a result of Old God influence. Because if Galakrond was influenced, why couldn't the 5 have been affected?
[1:26:08] stellar_sorcerer: He‚Äôs just being polite, it‚Äôs a dick move to just start calling her by her name
[1:26:09] woknarf: Nah, he's just being respectful lol
[1:26:12] Tyrgal1202: Nozdormu wasn't in the chamber of the heart in BFA but all the other Aspects were (well except for Ysera)
[1:26:15] apixelops: He has to ask her name so he can see her giving him her name in the past
[1:26:17] DarthTaz0: well maybe her name varies a bit by timeline. Like sometimes she's Thalember and knowing her name helps identify which timeline he's in.
[1:26:18] beeplaced: but her story is not yet written
[1:26:24] ChuckleButty: They exist outside of the timeline he can see. That's why he needs them?
[1:26:28] NiteOwl11617: @TaliesinAndEvitel Did you ever read Alan Moore's Watchmen? Could be like a Dr. Manhattan situation.
[1:26:30] Lenitas: He'd still need to ask, otherwise she wouldn't say it, so the time where she tells him her name never happens, so he wouldn't know
[1:26:51] Gorgosky: or just dosnt want to freak em out
[1:26:52] Quachiri: probably about the dracthyr considering the next cinematic to come
[1:26:53] literally_human_garbage: He knows she plays some role in his destiny specifically because he doesn't know her
[1:26:57] Bird_Years: If she never says her name, he won't be able to know it
[1:27:11] lucynsol: maybe neltharion purposely hid their existence from even him? mamsZPeek and only now he's learning about them
[1:27:11] Sharktribe: Maybe he's just asking her name to be polite?
[1:27:15] Trebled_Mind: What is it with the dracthyr that is hidden from time?
[1:27:16] Kyferus: i think the dracthyr are not part of the timeline or something. they were hidden from his sight all this time, and by unlocking waht ever it is he will know the truth about titans
[1:27:32] beeplaced: But what could it mean, if it is Muro?
[1:27:47] Abruhcadabro: Deathwing made the Drakthyr specifically as a personal army to fight AGAINST the other dragon flights. That's why they have the powers of all the flights and why Nozzy couldn't see their origins.
[1:27:50] blue_eyes769: could they be a shadow of their former selfs
[1:27:56] rof23: Cave men
[1:28:11] Quachiri: üîî
[1:28:13] Atomicpanda: are we supposed to be seeing something?
[1:28:15] Nulgar: could be a reference to Plato's Cave
[1:28:16] xirrizz: "from the shadows i come" StarCraft crossover
[1:28:20] AlpineHunterGSP: thats some serious... fore ... shadoowing
[1:28:32] palco2013: he is too big for the pathway, his dragon form lol
[1:28:34] Fibnkak: the dracthry are from WOD
[1:28:41] Sharktribe: Or because dragons fly, and leave shadows on the ground below them like raptors
[1:28:52] Zaelsus: I think him asking for Emberthal's name is also a way of him trying to gain their trust to do what he asks for at the end, because I would find it dodgy as hell if a random dude appeared knowing my name and everything about me, then asks me to do something for him @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:29:00] EighthEndless: @413xxx the first ones are the xel naga and starcraft and warcraft are actually the same multiverse
[1:29:06] Antstar12: could be that the dragons fate's are tied to the void/old gold, what is the void also known as? Shadow!!
[1:29:08] Spykadelic: There is a difference between being mysterious and being rude
[1:29:13] NiteOwl11617: Doesn't he explicitly state that there''s a future he can't see?
[1:29:16] Durwen: with Maalygos's help?
[1:29:19] Cibbip_: will the next new class we get to play come out of a prison? first DH's now drakthyr
[1:29:20] Okami_117: lizard tongue going flicky on the back of Nozdormu's neck (the shadows look like that to me... sorry) Cheer100
[1:29:22] Ellycat1: What if that was deathwing's design of rebellion vs the titans and his descent into madness will be framed as mostly titan propaganda. NotLikeThis
[1:29:27] VytheZ: he wants to know how he could not foresee his friend's Neltharion corruption
[1:29:36] skeletonetiquette: imagine how maddening it is to know everything and then find out thousands of years later there's something you don't know, and can't find out without help
[1:29:41] chiseria27: i reckon the dracthyr are still in jail, all the ones we see are actually nathrezim
[1:29:46] DragnosiOfNede: Because hidden deep within it, is the actual old god that corrupted Deathwing.  An as of yet previously undisclosed Old God (maybe even Void Lord).
[1:29:49] thunduz: tneTaliCry tneTaliCry tneTaliCry tneTaliCry
[1:29:52] Kyferus: rub it in our face bro
[1:29:55] bladestitch: Drachtyrs are so freaking tall.
[1:29:55] thunduz: too soon
[1:30:03] Harai_Ulfsark: wish i could be a tank
[1:30:05] Zaelsus: He brought all of the butter for them LUL
[1:30:08] Fibnkak: oh Laim Neeson
[1:30:10] Nulgar: not all NPC Dracthyr are Evokers
[1:30:21] EighthEndless: @DragnosiOfNede no, its very explicitly nzoth that corrupted him
[1:30:22] eyallse: fucking malfurion will come and save the day
[1:30:23] Harsbo: @DragnosiOfNede Uuh, a Void Lord, that would be interesting!
[1:30:29] Sharktribe: Evokers are one of the squishiest calsses lol
[1:30:32] Nulgar: @Fibnkak that's who he reminded me of tneEvi couldn't point at it
[1:30:35] Solstrike06: im like 90% sure dracthyr classes will be a patch content thing lol, theres no reason not to
[1:30:50] Kyferus: @Solstrike06 we can only hope so
[1:31:11] eyallse: i still wait for night elf paladin blizzarad
[1:31:21] Harsbo: This is a Diablo II reference!
[1:31:23] EighthEndless: the fact that drakthy can use basically every single weapon in the game shows that theyre almost certainly going to add more specs, probably in 11.0
[1:31:37] Kyferus: im also kinda disappointed in the lack of black dragon magic in them
[1:31:37] skeletonetiquette: imagine how maddening it is to know everything and then find out thousands of years later there's something you don't know, and can't find out without help
[1:31:47] netonkent: how could they become as great as aspects?
[1:31:49] eyallse: i hope the infnity dragons will fix wow lore
[1:32:12] ChuckleButty: From the Adventurer's guide on End Time dungeon: "... the tormented Nozdormu was tricked by the Old Gods into trying to subvert his mortality. As a result, Nozdormu shattered the timeways and created the infinite dragonflight..." He is currently trying to 'subvert his mortality' because he's now mortal. Adds fuel to your fire there @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:32:28] Kyferus: or more like civilization
[1:32:34] xirrizz: buttering them up
[1:32:38] EighthEndless: tali, there is that blank spot with the aspects in the tower
[1:32:40] Atomicpanda: the dracthyr might be elevated by the titans. tneDorkthyr
[1:32:40] Solstrike06: maybe he means as mighty as full grown dragons in general?
[1:32:47] Kyferus: not power wise but, culture city wise
[1:32:47] Harsbo: In Diablo II you see that guy follow a man into the depths of hell only to realize down there that the man is actually Diablo! Nozdormu walking down here feels like such a recreation of that Diablo scene
[1:32:50] blue_eyes769: maybe all the drakthyr together could be as powerfule like we as heros are as strong or stonger then the aspects at this point
[1:32:53] EighthEndless: emberthall could def ascent to aspect level and be one of the leaders
[1:32:59] YakSlacks: because they are now player character
[1:33:04] literally_human_garbage: Maybe Nozdormu considers them as children of the Aspects
[1:33:04] EighthEndless: **axcend
[1:33:12] EighthEndless: ****ascend damn i cant type
[1:33:13] thunduz: no I think he means power
[1:33:13] djadanis: the dracthyr were given access to the same magic of the aspects, they may master it in the future to elevate themselves?
[1:33:16] Estralmage: mighty doesnt suggest culture
[1:33:17] Ulashtlove: its pretty obvious from that statement that "Nozdormu" doesn't view the other aspects very highly anymore
[1:33:17] halux_: could be political might dunno
[1:33:18] Spykadelic: There are only 5 Aspects, so there might be enough Evokers to collectively be as much of a defence force as they were
[1:33:21] eyallse: the infnity dragons are the good guys
[1:33:21] netonkent: if that was the case the aspect would still be mighty
[1:33:23] Estralmage: mighty suggests power
[1:33:28] grimetotem: Emberthal new black dragonflight aspect confirmed
[1:33:31] Kyferus: like protectors of the world
[1:33:33] shortstackrin: just a father telling a child you can be stronger than us.
[1:33:39] Nulgar: "the desire for power" also reminds me of Josh Brolin's Thanos
[1:34:02] eyallse: maybe he will summ yrel
[1:34:04] luckydracolich: There as powerful as the champions of Azeroth who killed Deathwing
[1:34:14] Fibnkak: infinite Dracthry?
[1:34:16] blue_eyes769: maybe lore stuff he thinks the drakthyr could hold the same blessings the titans gave to the aspects
[1:34:17] shunko_ffxiv: @TaliesinAndEvitel Aren't we as the hero's stronger than the aspects base on all that we have accaccomplished?
[1:34:18] getswolljones: Is it because the dracthyr has free will and aren‚Äôt bound to represent aspects like the aspects were tasked to do
[1:34:24] djadanis: wouldn't murozond tell them about how weak they are but with his help they may ascend?
[1:34:27] Aeolidae: at first I was sad about Nozdormu becoming Murozond, but I really like the idea that he turns because he learned something devistating about the Titans. I think that's a neat theory and hope it is true.
[1:34:28] NiteOwl11617: @Nulgar I was just thinking that! Are we going to see Nozdormu dropping moons on people next?
[1:34:34] literally_human_garbage: Would be interesting if Nozdormu/Murozond pulls a Neltharion/Deathwing by tricking the Drac'thyr into giving him their power so he can defeat the other Aspects
[1:34:35] salvatorefortolino: maybe Deathwing had something to do with Nozdromu becomng Murozond and he meant the drakthyr for a purpose for him and now is the time?
[1:34:37] Line_0: I think he means that they will have to kill someone just like they had to kill deathwing
[1:34:42] eyallse: funny that the dragons have the same powers from this dragon movie
[1:34:52] Tyalexxx: Tyalexxx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 43 month streak! Good evening!
[1:34:55] Kyferus: i mean yes they are its numbers wise, not individual wise, the aspects couldnt take on deathwing
[1:34:58] eyallse: bravo
[1:35:29] Harsbo: And also perculiar that he bring it up just after sayng that the Drathyr are super powerful and that he needs their help
[1:35:33] Spykadelic: I still think he means collectively, not on a one to one scale. Much like our characters aren't as strong as a dragon one-to-one, but collectively we have matched them at least
[1:35:38] EighthEndless: dont forget that there are empty spaces in the dragon tower with the other aspects.  emberthall could ascend to aspect-esque power and lead the drakthyr as their "aspect"
[1:35:56] Aeolidae: tneStonyTony_TK
[1:36:04] Thoreya: LUL
[1:36:15] bangoobangoo: Could he not have just meant dragons, and not aspects?
[1:36:17] camba4ever: truth
[1:36:19] EighthEndless: didnt he say "the pursuit of power"?
[1:36:30] EighthEndless: the aspects didnt pursue power, they were granted it
[1:36:32] EighthEndless: as a reward
[1:36:35] ChuckleButty: It's similar to the Emperor and his 'Strike me down' thing. He's tempting them with power
[1:36:37] camba4ever: he's just speaking in hopeful hyperbole
[1:36:37] Lenitas: Yeah but we beat Zo'val who's Titan++
[1:36:45] Saumur: So, Im playing through the DK-Intro right now and I had problems differenciating between Nozi and Arthas talking, because they sound so similar. Not pointing out anything btw LUL
[1:36:47] XanderDarks: good morning @TaliesinAndEvitel hope you, and the family have been well man! <3 :3
[1:36:49] literally_human_garbage: @bangoobangoo He said "be as powerful as we ONCE were," implying when they were Aspects
[1:36:55] Atomicpanda: dracthyr can't even melee tneDorkthyr
[1:36:58] Line_0: feels like the game thinks differently a bit
[1:37:04] Kyferus: and they got slap by deathwing, and players became more powerfull collectivly then what they could do, the aspect couldnt defeat the legion players did. and now dracthyr are players
[1:37:15] EighthEndless: @Lenitas no, hes on the same level as the titans.  and we beat argus as well
[1:37:20] ebrahim_91: I actually love dragon lore now I know this will be good
[1:37:21] luckydracolich: Final raid of the expansion we kill all the aspects
[1:37:31] salvatorefortolino: what he wants us to c
[1:37:38] shortstackrin: Sand contructs
[1:37:39] bangoobangoo: @literally_human_garbage yeah true, although I think the word was mighty, right. Maybe he meant the dragonflights on the whole. "Age of dragons" and all that.
[1:38:02] Lenitas: @Lenitas Pantheon of Death has been described as Titan++ before SL launch
[1:38:05] literally_human_garbage: And that's why the visage forms of the Aspects look more modern than what I imagine they looked like at the time (assuming they even had visage forms back then?)
[1:38:45] Solstrike06: I agree having it be a 'vision' of the past would be better for storytelling, but how do we know that? couldnt he really be traveling to the past, since we do that ingame? (i think?)
[1:39:06] bladestitch: Bad boy.
[1:39:14] fathomlordcrunch: I think he has something bad going on
[1:39:15] shortstackrin: Got that horn bling
[1:39:30] netonkent: why doesnt she know what the dragon isles look like? aren't they from there
[1:39:43] Lenitas: Neltharion*
[1:40:11] shortstackrin: I think would clarify this with Murazond. That guy seems alright.
[1:40:17] Qustav: the later part of the cinematic does say that "the sands of times dont lie, trust your eyes", so he does imply that everything seen here is 1 to 1
[1:40:19] literally_human_garbage: @Solstrike06 If they were actually traveling into the past, everyone would be like "woah why is there a 2nd nozdormu and what is that weird dragon thing next to him?"
[1:40:35] kameleon0728: Oh harder daddy Neltharion
[1:40:37] Mezukage: General meaning Zaddy in their language Kappa
[1:40:37] Zaelsus: It could also be that the dragon isles they know were different to what she sees here
[1:40:40] Durwen: Daddy D 2.0?
[1:40:58] Harai_Ulfsark: @Qustav but then nozdormu could simply be a non reliable narrator
[1:41:15] Aeolidae: I'm super excited to hear more about the creation of the Dracs
[1:41:16] Solstrike06: @Solstrike06 thats true, I figured that they were 'shrouded' from view or something like that, like 'observing the past but not partaking' idk
[1:41:21] bladestitch: Given that they have abilites of the other dragonflight are Dracthyr some sort of chromatic dragon?
[1:41:29] Qustav: @Qustav true, but it does imply that the visions he is showing are seperate from his opinions
[1:41:42] Ellycat1: I think he might not have been purely corrupted but rather rebelled against the titans as their masters. danHmm
[1:41:54] xIncryptedx: look, a little bit of void typically has been a good thing. just don't worry about it. rhyzDEAD
[1:41:56] saedar: Yeah but isn't the neat thing about mortals that we are really good at integrating cosmic forces?
[1:41:59] Ueberschande: dracthyr shadow priest confirmed?
[1:42:08] EighthEndless: he mustve used the dragon soul to craft the drakthyr
[1:42:08] s7wede: Didn't he use the dragonsoul to create them. That was post corruption
[1:42:10] HeadlessBoogey: HeadlessBoogey subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months, currently on a 38 month streak! 38 and counting <3 :)   hope you're well tali!
[1:42:13] djadanis: maybe the corruption was the missing piece to combine all of the dragon's titanic powers ?
[1:42:21] EighthEndless: its why he convinced the other aspects to use parts of their power to
[1:42:22] djadanis: which was why nefarian couldn't make them again?
[1:42:26] EighthEndless: empower the dragon soul
[1:42:30] Runzi333: I thought it was before all of the corruption because the old gods prisons were still fully intact back then?
[1:42:31] Nulgar: @s7wede no, the Dracthyr were imprisoned a good while before the War of the Ancients
[1:42:32] Kyferus: wish they inherited tanking powers from black dragonflight
[1:42:34] xIncryptedx: @maikeull old god goo glue
[1:42:34] gurkenglashalbvoll: @TaliesinAndEvitel Btw why do the visage forms look like High Elves when even the Highborn back then had blue/purple skin (even Dath'remar was kinda purple, he just had golden hair)
[1:42:56] shortstackrin: Maybe he made them because he couldn't fix his own corruption. All his power and he couldn't fix himself. But the dracthyr are immune, thusly stronger than him.
[1:42:56] djadanis: @xIncryptedx exactly
[1:43:00] Aeolidae: bc they wanted to
[1:43:09] saedar: @TaliesinAndEvitel Could part of this expac be about recontextualizing the concept of "corruption" in WoW?
[1:43:40] SwimsDry: Theoretically too if they are partially corrupted wouldn‚Äôt that give them a sense of free will that the dragons themselves just cannot possess. Maybe that is why he needs the Dracthyr‚Äôs help to see what he is unable to.
[1:43:44] Sharktribe: I'd put money on Drakthyr NOT being corrupted, their magic effects, etc are too "pure".
[1:43:46] EighthEndless: that little bit of corruption could ensure free will for the drakthyr
[1:43:47] xIncryptedx: @gurkenglashalbvoll they based their forms a bit on the high elves of the past they interacted with
[1:43:55] Bradykinn: was neltharion corrupted when he made the dracthyr? I thought that happened later, I thought they were made like ~20k years ago
[1:43:56] s7wede: @s7wede The problem I have with the timeline is that the Dracthyr are flight agnostic. Wouldn't the other flights realize that eggs were going missing?
[1:44:11] IHDarklord: IHDarklord subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! Weeeeee, last Shadowlands sub! :D
[1:44:24] fathomlordcrunch: is murozond after the gold beam orb that they used or is he looking for an old god that he can't find
[1:44:37] Line_0: thats what i think
[1:44:42] grimetotem: Emberthal name.
[1:44:42] bladestitch: It looks so good.
[1:44:58] gurkenglashalbvoll: @xIncryptedx But this scene here happens during the war of the ancients, when High Elves didn't even exist (I mean look at the Shen'dralar, their Highborne and very blueish/purpleish like all other Night Elves)
[1:45:00] xIncryptedx: i hope murazond gets the dragon soul and uses it to fire a beam at the red star in an attempt to free us from arcane titan corruption
[1:45:02] saedar: Malygos hot.
[1:45:12] Kyferus: test tube babies
[1:45:18] CometOtter: Im legit disappointed that Visage Malygos has such a tiny beard.
[1:45:22] literally_human_garbage: Hotboi Malygos - it is canon that all blue dragons are hotbois
[1:45:26] grimetotem: Emberthals name is interesting. Ember - smouldering remnants. Thal - Of Earth.
[1:45:26] GabrielBelinazo: is murozond the next episode?
[1:45:33] Line_0: ysera looks weird here
[1:45:34] EighthEndless: it seems like neltharion used the dragon soul.  otherwise how would he have gotten the powers of the other aspects?
[1:45:45] BertTheFrenchy: @grimetotem Neltharion was the Earthwarder
[1:45:47] xIncryptedx: @gurkenglashalbvoll i know. war of the ancients has a little blurb about how the elves think they look weird with fair skin and such
[1:45:48] bladestitch: Wonder what Embertals visage will be?
[1:45:50] EighthEndless: which would confirm that neltharion was corrupted when the drakthyr were created
[1:45:52] PariahG: I want Ysera's outfit
[1:45:53] shortstackrin: has Ysera alway been that short?
[1:45:58] Nulgar: @CometOtter that was 10k years ago, through
[1:46:01] netonkent: don't you think how he describes alexdreza as pissed offf
[1:46:02] bladestitch: sus
[1:46:02] Fibnkak: whay are all the dragons elves but the bad guy is a human?
[1:46:04] Synyster182: I don't know if want to know how they were created... that'd be some odd porn i fear.
[1:46:07] cardrenn: imagine they hint at murozond in the last sec of the last episode
[1:46:07] xIncryptedx: @gurkenglashalbvoll it is basically an oversight they had to create a reason for
[1:46:17] neleaza: those are actually his horn shape
[1:46:20] FaeyeLinn: Where can I find these cinematics?
[1:46:21] neleaza: im pretty sure
[1:46:22] NiteOwl11617: Hey, maybe the dude just likes spikes
[1:46:30] goggarthy: He just looks sus
[1:46:30] xIncryptedx: @cardrenn i thought his desperation at the end of this cinematic was a little murazondy
[1:46:36] EighthEndless: @FaeyeLinn google, wowhead, or warcraft dot com
[1:46:37] literally_human_garbage: It IS his horn shape, but they do evoke old god tentacles as well
[1:46:49] fathomlordcrunch: dracula
[1:46:50] Runzi333: Those are the new outfits so is that them returning to old visage forms or Nozzy showing them in a way Ember would more currently come to know them I wonder
[1:47:00] Trebled_Mind: Neltharion was the goth punk kid of the group
[1:47:05] bladestitch: This is the eye discussion again. XD
[1:47:11] JoshMakesGames: his form is human?
[1:47:11] hulkhockey: @Trebbled_Mind very true
[1:47:11] AsanoRan: he stands appart by having a human visage while the others are elven
[1:47:12] McShloven: Oh snap Tali doing a video analysis!!! This is some of my favorite content thanks for doing these man!!
[1:47:14] FaeyeLinn: @FaeyeLinn I could have guessed that, but they're unordered there.
[1:47:16] Jannikhp: i don't belivie you :D
[1:47:17] Lenitas: Wasn't it at least implied in Dawn of the Aspects, that Neltharion heard Old God whispers right from the start?
[1:47:25] s7wede: Everybody wants Nozdormu to be the final boss but I want to join the Infinite dragonflight. Wasn't there a datamined Tabard?
[1:47:26] Dolphil: never thought of his form being human
[1:47:28] MarcusMaximi: LUL
[1:47:33] gurkenglashalbvoll: @xIncryptedx Wait, that's mentioned in the book triolgy?
[1:47:37] Durwen: Two things can be true at the same time
[1:47:41] Nulgar: symbo-what? Dude, just show, don't tell /s
[1:47:49] TownPortaI: @Asanoran Actually i didnt notice this.
[1:47:50] salvatorefortolino: he looks like a shady banker :D
[1:47:56] Kyferus: look at gigers work... its a PPs
[1:47:58] Ellycat1: He looks a bit like a vrykul.
[1:48:05] netonkent: do you think conscious is an interesting word? almost like she thinks she right
[1:48:06] Harsbo: Couldn't it be a Titan-inspired visage form?
[1:48:07] bladestitch: Maybe he just didn't like pointy ears.
[1:48:08] shortstackrin: what a pronounced chin he has...
[1:48:08] Fibnkak: no taruen no trolls no pandareans  theya re Alliance bias
[1:48:11] xIncryptedx: @gurkenglashalbvoll yep. i think it is in the first book
[1:48:12] Lenitas: Well this has to be before the Sundering, because they're in Valdrakken
[1:48:13] VytheZ: Visage forms is just for us viewers
[1:48:13] literally_human_garbage: I'm wondering if what we're being shown isn't REALLY how they looked back then? Like would there have been a need for a visage form?
[1:48:15] fathomlordcrunch: maybe he did some time trav first
[1:48:17] Nulgar: could've been a Vrykul
[1:48:21] gurkenglashalbvoll: @TaliesinAndEvitel Humans existed, but were slaves to the Kaldorei, which is fucking weird
[1:48:22] Acheronas: He wanted to stand out from the rest of them
[1:48:23] blumberquack: Could also be that they just want to be human :p
[1:48:23] Mathavian: Not according to Game of Thrones. Themes are for book reports, not media. Obviously.
[1:48:27] Retiosanti: Vrykisage
[1:48:33] netonkent: there was definely no high elves
[1:48:34] thunduz: humans are vykrl, vykrl are from odyn, Odyn is connected to deathwings corruption!!
[1:48:36] mxfelwinter: It's like in media, if in an army dress they like nazi officers, you know they are not the good guys
[1:48:41] avohaj: I mean they ARE bigger in their visage form
[1:48:45] Dolphil: Is Nozdormu a high elf then?
[1:48:48] Nulgar: and didn't I read somewhere that Humans participated in the War of the Ancients?
[1:48:48] wickedjesther: maybe he took a visage of a titan keeper
[1:48:49] Bradykinn: Since this is a memory by Nozdormu, the specific visage looks could be retconned a bit by him. Or maybe Neltharion had some part to play in humanity
[1:48:52] fathomlordcrunch: that's defiantly dracula look
[1:48:54] tnhorrorfan: Why does he look like Mr sinister
[1:48:55] Line_0: yeah lol
[1:48:56] Rolaz: why Nozdormu didnt see Deathwing betrayal or he didnt believe it ? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:48:58] Fibnkak: trolls existed.
[1:49:03] Bundschuh: @thunduz Lie, it was the Jailor all along dont spread lies
[1:49:04] Fibnkak: taurne existed
[1:49:04] YakSlacks: i thought neltharions shoulder pads look more like a dragons claws grabbing his shoulders
[1:49:05] EighthEndless: slave to the titans
[1:49:08] salvatorefortolino: or since he's perhaps already corrupted, the 'concept' of human form already existed in the old god plans and they used that for him?
[1:49:10] gurkenglashalbvoll: Yeah, it's either an oversight or at least bizarre
[1:49:15] OatsMate: Ysera having a completely different Visage than normal is kinda weird.
[1:49:22] TownPortaI: Nelth did kinda take an odyn role. And we didnt take care of odyn yet and his brothers/sister just let him dip and hide this whole time.
[1:49:23] AsanoRan: it's strange when we've gotten so used to seeing them as elves. the only other 'other' we know are chromie as a gnome
[1:49:27] ArkyteCurse: Maybe he feels like a slave to the titans
[1:49:28] xIncryptedx: @Dolphil no, he just likes the look. we know blood elves got fairer skinned with exposure to arcane energy. dragons are infused with it so maybe that is why.
[1:49:29] Runzi333: The outfits are new so likely not the correct to time visage form but the most recent for the viewers to easily understand
[1:49:31] MostGratuitous: Did high elves exist yet? Nozdormu codes as one.
[1:49:32] Kyferus: where the dwarft dragons?! or trolls? racist elf dragons lol
[1:49:33] FriendMorf: I think that's just more indicative of his aspect of earth part. humans evolved from vrykrul who were part stone, etc etc?
[1:49:35] azrael962000: well the time dragon is showing some one something they would use the form that person knew or the vision wouldnt make sense
[1:49:45] Sharktribe: kadorei ensalved humans??
[1:49:53] literally_human_garbage: Since this is a vision we're being shown by Nozdormu, it could be just how he chooses to show them to us rather than how they actually looked
[1:49:55] Aeolidae: Senegos is a troll
[1:49:57] mxfelwinter: Wait...but at the time the aspects were created, the elves were trolls, aren't they, tali?
[1:50:05] xIncryptedx: high elves existed, but they were a bit darker skinned as they were evolved from dark trolls @MostGratuitous
[1:50:05] shortstackrin: the earth dragons didn't know more about what was the race's were doing more than the other flights
[1:50:07] halux_: can we comment that malygos?
[1:50:10] Kyferus: NO
[1:50:11] shortstackrin: did*
[1:50:34] TownPortaI: The hornes on his shoulders look almost like Feathers. Medihv
[1:50:37] Kyferus: they got visage form to talk to mortal races so before that they didnt have any, no need
[1:50:43] AlanC2024: when they became aspects they probably had no need for visage forms
[1:50:44] TownPortaI: xd
[1:50:45] Abruhcadabro: I assume Noz is just showing their current forms, so they would be recognizable.
[1:50:57] salvatorefortolino: @Mexrage yea it's a it murky as well ;)
[1:51:01] netonkent: in the well of eternity books. they was no high elves but 2 of them look like them which makes no sense.
[1:51:02] fathomlordcrunch: I thought it was in a book they took them to communicate with the children of azeroth
[1:51:02] Yetik: Titans have ¬´ human ¬ª forms
[1:51:16] GoldSmog: Brox tneTaliCry
[1:51:29] xIncryptedx: technically dragons can take whatever visage form they want, real race or not. nozdormu is a time god, so he would know blood elves exist and what they look like
[1:51:33] Trebled_Mind: Well the Titans looked ‚Äúhuman-like‚Äù right? so maybe neltharion was just arrogantly imitating the looks of a titan?
[1:51:35] literally_human_garbage: @xIncryptedx Well that's not technically true. The night elves, or Kaldorei, were evolved from the dark trolls near the well of eternity. The upper classes of the Kaldorei were called the Highborne, but were definitely night elves.
[1:51:47] Line_0: and the ticking
[1:51:50] Geoblood: anyone else noticing the clock ticking in the background
[1:51:57] TownPortaI: The seas have seen it all
[1:52:02] Solstrike06: i like how the music changes at the same time as the water color changes
[1:52:05] Kyferus: yes
[1:52:05] AsanoRan: yeah
[1:52:07] Thoreya: yes
[1:52:07] Ellycat1: Yes
[1:52:08] salvatorefortolino: @xIncryptedx Yes but the visage form is high elf
[1:52:09] djadanis: there is
[1:52:09] wickedjesther: Deathwing saw Rhonin?
[1:52:10] Lenitas: Definitely
[1:52:12] Yetik: Yeah very cool shot
[1:52:16] xIncryptedx: @literally_human_garbage oh i thought the elves were just all "high elves" back then but yeah i am remembering there were the highborn, not high elves
[1:52:18] Kyferus: thats what i mean its a ticking time bomb
[1:52:20] Nulgar: kinda, yes
[1:52:26] Bradykinn: Interesting. I wonder what the clock at that specific point means.
[1:52:38] shortstackrin: They just left the metronome on while recording
[1:52:42] InfernoRain: Peter Pan is canon
[1:52:45] literally_human_garbage: @xIncryptedx The exiled Highborne traveled to the eastern kingdoms and formed Quel'thalas, eventually becoming what we know now as High Elves
[1:52:52] Kyferus: its to simbolize deathwing becomming what he will, and by proxy Murozond
[1:52:57] Ellycat1: To create his one ring.
[1:52:58] xIncryptedx: @salvatorefortolino he is a time god that can see every moment in time. the other dragons just copied noz.
[1:52:58] srsFist: are we getting into Clockmaker territory?
[1:53:08] saedar: She looks VERY feline in this.
[1:53:15] salvatorefortolino: @xIncryptedx lol good one, I take that ;)
[1:53:24] xIncryptedx: @salvatorefortolino rhyzGIGA
[1:53:25] shortstackrin: I feel like her back story has been shrunken...
[1:53:26] bslapp: nice hat
[1:53:29] TownPortaI: Runes coming threw on that dragon like its reverting to a prototype.
[1:53:32] blumberquack: I want those horns tbh
[1:53:42] TownPortaI: oh
[1:53:43] TownPortaI: thats a demon
[1:53:51] fathomlordcrunch: whys she in visage and not drag9n form
[1:53:53] salvatorefortolino: @xIncryptedx but now i need a cinematic of the meeting where he presented the catalog hahaha
[1:53:54] Ellycat1: Yes, alex's horns are perfection
[1:54:19] gurkenglashalbvoll: big brain mode
[1:54:26] BreninUK: All of the dragons do it
[1:54:31] BreninUK: in the book
[1:54:32] Durwen: Option 1
[1:54:34] JoshMakesGames: i thought it was all of them
[1:54:35] Line_0: looks like all dragons
[1:54:36] xIncryptedx: @salvatorefortolino nozdormu time-bending fashion montage
[1:54:38] gurkenglashalbvoll: a)
[1:54:38] BelacKriv: this is like, almost the same shot from when they destroy it as well, later
[1:54:49] TrixStar36: It‚Äôs just their shadow but as a dragon
[1:54:50] VoidPoet: All dragons do it which is why the Demon Soul can be used to compel all dragons
[1:54:57] YakSlacks: it was the aspects and some of their consorts i thought
[1:55:00] The_Action_Man: those dragons don't look like the Aspects either
[1:55:02] Prinnylipi: They use the same shot later in the video, right?
[1:55:06] TownPortaI: LIGHt from shadow kinda like anduin in the maw
[1:55:08] Line_0: yeah if you go back you can see it isnt their shadows
[1:55:10] BreninUK: its the reason he has power over all of them
[1:55:13] avohaj: basically it's a spirit bomb
[1:55:19] MoistPriest: It was all part of the jailors plan
[1:55:19] AlpineHunterGSP: lol
[1:55:23] Honorbean: like the moon
[1:55:25] Aeolidae: who's the artist(s) who did these scenes?
[1:55:27] grimetotem: elune
[1:55:28] Durwen: Captain planet?
[1:55:28] ryarose42: eclipse from night warrior?
[1:55:31] netonkent: nosdurmo didn't actually take part in this. it was his mate. but he talks like he was there
[1:55:32] blumberquack: First thought here was "they're making a smiley face :)"
[1:55:33] filthytoaster: elunes cinematic in ardenweald
[1:55:38] halux_: yogg saron fight?
[1:55:38] TownPortaI: Anduin in the maw
[1:55:39] Retiosanti: The Golden Disk from Beast Wars
[1:55:45] Line_0: i did too, but i dont know what it is
[1:55:46] TownPortaI: Anduin being able to summon light inthe maw.
[1:55:48] Ueberschande: corruption of green dragon
[1:55:49] Zivs: yseras death kinda
[1:55:49] BertTheFrenchy: When we gave up our artifact's powers
[1:55:49] Harai_Ulfsark: ysera dying cinematic
[1:55:52] Caenogenesis: Heart of Azeroth
[1:55:54] literally_human_garbage: @Retiosanti what a throwback
[1:55:54] bad_gizmo: heartof azeroth?
[1:55:56] timeninja888: is it when thrasll uses it to shoot deathwing down
[1:55:56] lokyr5: One of the lazer balls from Spencers?
[1:55:58] FriendMorf: Pink Floyd Album cover?
[1:55:59] LordZzer0: We channeling artifact powers in sword?
[1:56:02] SleepyPlant2: end of battle for azeroth?
[1:56:06] xIncryptedx: channeling our artifacts into the sword PoroSad
[1:56:07] TheDeekins: artifact weapons into the sword
[1:56:07] fathomlordcrunch: anduin in the birth canal
[1:56:08] Adherbal032: genkidama ?
[1:56:09] skeletonetiquette: can you play it again? was on audio only
[1:56:10] goggarthy: Dragon soul ü§©
[1:56:11] Adrianocirilo: gentileza dama from dbz
[1:56:12] TownPortaI: Anduin being able to summon light inthe maw..
[1:56:16] neirfman: looks like reverse elune moon from war of thorns?
[1:56:16] nejore: the start of the argus fight
[1:56:25] grimetotem: It's similar to when Elune raises Yseras spirit in Legion. I'm sure.
[1:56:28] xIncryptedx: @TheDeekins NODDERS
[1:56:29] Adrianocirilo: genki dama from dbz
[1:56:31] nejore: it reminds me of the titens beaming argus
[1:56:33] bladestitch: Just waiting for someone to meme it with a troll face.
[1:56:37] BreninUK: Maybe captain planet combining the power of the rings >.<
[1:56:48] LGashly: @grimetotem yep, I think its this
[1:57:03] salvatorefortolino: @xIncryptedx SeemsGood
[1:57:09] azrael962000: well thats not nice
[1:57:19] grimetotem: It's what I immediately thought when I saw that part
[1:57:23] halux_: is that music end times raid music?
[1:57:26] AlanC2024: He killed 90% of the blue dragonflight here and drove Malygos mad
[1:57:29] Line_0: maybe just any dragon
[1:57:34] AlderadeCast: Tyran ?
[1:57:39] McShloven: Unnamed red shirt right?
[1:57:45] salvatorefortolino: ANYONE FOUND WHO THIS IS IN THE END?
[1:57:45] EighthEndless: i still think thats a black dragon, suggesting that deathwing even attacked his own brood
[1:57:49] literally_human_garbage: I'm not sure it's any one dragon of particular significance
[1:57:52] kaijoe_: It sounds like what plays in the Wrathgate at the end?
[1:57:53] Yetik: Also how could nozdormu not forsee thia betrayal ?
[1:57:56] Labatleam: no it's no
[1:58:01] Labatleam: not*
[1:58:02] kaijoe_: When the red dragons are burning the corpses
[1:58:07] blumberquack: Kappa
[1:58:11] Kyferus: so what do you see mf?!
[1:58:21] Norayota: LUL
[1:58:21] Saumur: You had one job, Nozi
[1:58:24] shortstackrin: I guess he didn't have the time
[1:58:24] TownPortaI: @Yetik Noz wasnt there he was already frozen in time with the drac himself.
[1:58:24] Caenogenesis: aw jeez! my future seeing powers just werent up to task! sorry guys!
[1:58:26] bad_gizmo: LUL
[1:58:26] Line_0: all bronze dragons failed LUL
[1:58:26] azrael962000: lol
[1:58:28] Quachiri: probably old God corruption
[1:58:28] VytheZ: That's what he wants to know at the end of this video
[1:58:29] blumberquack: Tbf there is a LOT of time to look through LUL
[1:58:30] AlpineHunterGSP: #worstdragonaspect
[1:58:30] Lenitas: Nozdormu was AFK during war of the ancients, his concert was his stand in
[1:58:32] Kyferus: he's a fake
[1:58:33] AsanoRan: maybe he had lag?
[1:58:34] halux_: *** patch 4.3 music
[1:58:35] Yetik: big yikes nozdormu
[1:58:36] salvatorefortolino: Velen made the same mistake
[1:58:39] gurkenglashalbvoll: @TaliesinAndEvitel I think that's explained because the Old Gods created a time anomaly, if I remember correctly
[1:58:40] JoshMakesGames: is it possible he never looked through time until after this happened, so he didnt know beforehand
[1:58:40] jevinkames6: so many tachyons blocking Dr. Nozdormu
[1:58:43] saedar: Almost like his view of time is FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW
[1:58:43] TownPortaI: Noz had a fill in and was already limbo in another timeline
[1:58:47] Ellycat1: Could he not see because the void influence protects against time travelling viewing? The void also sees properly all.
[1:58:51] Line_0: yeah could be
[1:58:51] aeradrys: Perhaps it‚Äôs Alex just being horrified at the wreckage of their decision?
[1:58:56] Qustav: could also suggest that the events are part of the true timeline, so cant intervene?
[1:58:57] Yetik: YEAP
[1:59:08] lucynsol: could be the same way he might know of Emberthal's name mamsGasp
[1:59:14] lucynsol: not know*
[1:59:15] Kyferus: seems to have a blindspot to old god shit
[1:59:16] Drazarr: Or Murozond has been helping Neltharian hide things from time
[1:59:19] salvatorefortolino: maybe the cave is NOT in the time loop?
[1:59:21] djadanis: maybe murozond can keep nozdormu from scrying certain old god related stuff?
[1:59:27] salvatorefortolino: it's like in limbo?
[1:59:27] Saumur: or Moruzond Kappa
[1:59:30] Line_0: yeah that or old god stuff
[1:59:37] xIncryptedx: even if he saw it it is also possible he was just in deep denial. he isn't exactly the most stable of the aspects himself.
[1:59:38] qolafrog: what if nozdormu knew about it but couldn't interfere because its part of the timeline
[1:59:38] EighthEndless: nozdormu can see an ordered path, because arcane energy.
[1:59:43] azrael962000: oh noes
[1:59:47] GoldSmog: Don't they trap him in the time ways in the book orsomething
[1:59:50] halux_: the shadow shows many futures, not necesseraily the true one
[1:59:51] shortstackrin: makes sense that all of the dragons counter each other. They all had the same power source
[1:59:52] netonkent: so what he " has seen" could be the next cinematic
[1:59:53] Kyferus: OR! a titan thing
[1:59:56] Honorbean: good point
[2:00:00] McShloven: Yeah you know logic would say old god thing but who know's what the lore will say when it's written.
[2:00:07] mcbeaty: Maybe the outcome was worst, not making the dragon soul would have been the end of AZ/
[2:00:10] Ellycat1: And drakthyr stuff, which deathwing just happened to have made.
[2:00:14] TheDeekins: sands of time are the same color as the light, which sees only one true path
[2:00:22] Estralmage: I believe in the Books, that Deathwing uses the dragon soul and Nozdormu's own power to alter what he was able to see. I thought it was a kind of retroactive thing that he did
[2:00:24] gurkenglashalbvoll: @TaliesinAndEvitel I could look it up but in the books it's I think explained through the time anomaly created by the Old Gods
[2:00:24] Line_0: maybe he cant see dracthyr well either
[2:00:26] salvatorefortolino: maybe at the time it simply didnt occur to Noz to check what will happen casue he did not suspect
[2:00:27] Gragnar: power of Nozdormu is from Order, they're not known for seeing all possible paths
[2:00:31] Saumur: But still it would be rather interesteing, that the titans create the aspects to protect Azeroth from partly the old gods and the aspects have a blind spot for old gods LUL
[2:00:31] Quachiri: if he does have a blind spot maybe that's partly to do with the titans keeping things from him?
[2:00:37] ryarose42: maybe he knew dragonsoul was only way to stop Deathwing in the end?
[2:00:38] djadanis: that would make sense that time is an Order ability, and old gods are anything but ordered
[2:00:39] s7wede: Maybe being a creation of Order he cannot understand the Chaos of Old God influence
[2:00:41] saedar: Or Noz isn't as all-seeing as he thinks.
[2:00:43] Lenitas: I think Nozordmu knew, because he was shown his death and told he could never change it, so he could know Deathwing would turn and just not be able to do anything about it. But that does make his statement "we could not foresee" weird
[2:00:47] grimetotem: EMBER - burning remnants. Thal - Of Earth. I'm telling you there's something there man
[2:00:49] Kyferus: I think Titans have really good version of parental controll that He can not see through @TaliesinAndEvitel
[2:00:53] Unciatim: most likely due to the old gods being on same power level as the titans.
[2:01:02] salvatorefortolino: well we all know that can be difficult to see all at once
[2:01:03] EighthEndless: @TheDeekins arcane is fairly far removed from light on the universal-power-cube, but yea, im of the same thinking
[2:01:04] AlpineHunterGSP: or he stops time to be that no it all to google it while times frozen
[2:01:06] TheDeekins: Maybe Nozdurmo had a crush on him and didn't want to look ahead in the story to keep the tension
[2:01:06] TownPortaI: Noz doesnt predict or change shit in the future hes afraid of his own death so he only shows people shit thatsa already happened and allows them to try and change it  so he doesnt move forward into his own demise.
[2:01:12] Rolaz: @TaliesinAndEvitel Maybe Nozdormu cant see his future or all related future where he is present? I think Amanthul showed his death, not a Nozdormy saw it.
[2:01:19] mcbeaty: Norzdomo needed the dragon soul to defeat the legion.
[2:01:22] saedar: @TheDeekins uwu
[2:01:27] ArkyteCurse: I think it's more that Noz has access to everything that happens, but he only knows what he's looked into
[2:01:40] Uthanman: Kinda imagining Nozdormu having a prediction chat on his timephone loaded with unread messages now
[2:01:42] TheDeekins: when he's so hot you don't want to look ahead in time to see how he breaks your heart trikSugarDaddy
[2:01:43] Streetfarm32: That's how I felt about the Dracthyr eye in the first cienmatic
[2:01:45] Line_0: love this story
[2:01:48] Caenogenesis: bit wide isnt he
[2:01:50] Qustav: or, he needs to look through the events explicitly to gain knowledge of those events. but it still doesnt explain how he's unable to know some things he has tried to find out about
[2:01:52] TownPortaI: Noz cant move forward himself hes afraid of his own death. He shows timeways and allow those untouched by it to try and change it for him
[2:01:53] ryarose42: I think its connected with the next line saying he chose not to believe it even though he saw it
[2:02:01] VoidPoet: A theme at this point that all characters who are supposedly ‚Äúomniscient‚Äù or able to see the future are always wrong as soon as mortals come into the equation.
[2:02:02] Kyferus: Ticking timebomb!
[2:02:04] salvatorefortolino: he looks like he is musing
[2:02:09] Solstrike06: "we could not foresee, or perhaps did not want to believe" Sounds like Nozdormu might have saw it and just didnt want the knowledge?
[2:02:25] EighthEndless: @VoidPoet yea, the patterns giving rise to the chaos of reality
[2:02:31] Adrianocirilo: @taliesinandevitel or is it a trick of murazond to keep nozdormu from prevent hiz transformation
[2:02:39] Trebled_Mind: What would have happened I wonder‚Ä¶.if Deathwing got Azerite?
[2:02:41] salvatorefortolino: could be yes
[2:02:42] Streetfarm32: Chronicles ARE titan-written... Maybe it WAS the truth the titans, and they want to hide that?
[2:02:47] TownPortaI: THATS WHY HE DOESNT MOVE FORWARD HE JUST SHOWS PEOPLE THE PAST and lets them try and change it
[2:02:49] salvatorefortolino: SO WHO IS THAT?
[2:02:51] TownPortaI: Hes afraid to move forward HIMSELF
[2:02:58] TownPortaI: Because himself will just turn and he knows that
[2:03:00] Runzi333: If he can't see everything than is the corruption he "knows" is coming actually unavoidable or was he just told it was?
[2:03:03] InfernoRain: Can it not be Nelfarion?
[2:03:06] Iwony: Prolly a child or a consolt
[2:03:07] Line_0: i think its just a random black dragon, to show that deathwing killed everyone
[2:03:07] Kyferus: could be her mate, somehow she made so many babies
[2:03:12] TownPortaI: Hes gonna need someone to make the hard decision in killing there new general.
[2:03:13] neleaza: It could very well just be one of her childern
[2:03:13] elleria_plays: greg
[2:03:14] salvatorefortolino: Cprialstraz,
[2:03:14] jzonna: It should be Tyranastrasz. He died to Deathwing
[2:03:17] halux_: koriastralz
[2:03:19] GoldSmog: Krasus but dragon name
[2:03:19] salvatorefortolino: Cor*
[2:03:19] Streetfarm32: Bob
[2:03:19] ryarose42: doesn't he say "we could not forsee, because we didn't want to believe", meaning he saw it but didn't believe it
[2:03:21] wickedjesther: KoticKstrasz
[2:03:21] Solstrike06: No Korialstrasz exploded
[2:03:22] RAF_Sean: Korialstraz - Can't be him he doesn't die then
[2:03:23] gurkenglashalbvoll: Korialalstrasz?
[2:03:23] Line_0: the other one was black
[2:03:23] Wunani: CaptianStrasza
[2:03:33] xIncryptedx: it can't be krasus
[2:03:35] BuckyDK: Reddish-black,
[2:03:37] heal_corpse: korialstrasz
[2:03:40] Giralte: syndragosa
[2:03:44] neleaza: Krasus dies during way way way later
[2:03:49] elleria_plays: Pretty sure Deathwing killed Greg
[2:03:49] xIncryptedx: it is 100% not korialstrasz/krasus
[2:03:50] salvatorefortolino: I checked this a little bit yesterday after the stream but came up empty
[2:03:50] wickedjesther: look at the horns tho!
[2:03:52] literally_human_garbage: Truly - I think she's just among her brood, maybe not anyone in particular
[2:03:52] Kyferus: @BuckyDK yeah the black its cause they were burn alive lol
[2:03:53] Fibnkak: @BuckyDK red and burned black
[2:03:54] Nulgar: Korialstrasz = Krasus died at the end of WotLK
[2:03:55] wickedjesther: look like black
[2:03:59] TownPortaI: Because he never goes ahead in time. Not because he cant see.. hes afraid to go forward because he was shown morazond.... Lmao he only shows people the past to allow them to change it since he cant move forward with changing anything himself....
[2:04:02] bslapp: Redshirtystrasza
[2:04:02] RAF_Sean: Korialstraz DOES get nuked when he dives into Deathwing to knock the Soul from his hands. Might be him injured, not dead?
[2:04:08] Wildflower_Ink: or it could be rando
[2:04:15] AlanC2024: One of her consorts. Maybe an unamed one. In the war of the ancients book she has 3 or 4 consorts.
[2:04:17] Wunani: Oh shoot, I know who that is Its Timothy the Dragon
[2:04:18] bad_gizmo: maybe this is the moment he forses something
[2:04:24] djadanis: couldn't that just be one of her kids ? she's the aspect of life so any death is horrible to her, especially her kids
[2:04:24] Line_0: just a random dragon to show that everyone dies imo
[2:04:24] Zaelsus: With the old gods having their "seeing everything at the same time", that could give some credence to the naming of the infinite dragonflight (if the reason behind the name isn't already established) and maybe Nozdormu "gaining control" over the infinite timelines, but in the end not having the control he believes he has and goes full madman Murozond on us
[2:04:24] elleria_plays: @Wildflower_Ink That's always an option
[2:04:29] salvatorefortolino: what is this is noone in paricular, after all Alex has great compassion for all
[2:04:29] netonkent: she loves all life so could be any dragon
[2:04:39] jzonna: Yes, the Second War is where Tyranastrasz died
[2:04:44] Solstrike06: Which, I just learned Korialstrasz died yesterday and Ive played since BC, thanks Books for having important events lol, I thought he was alive this whole time
[2:04:46] Sharktribe: It's Greg.
[2:04:47] salvatorefortolino: sorry about typos cold hands but wont use my gas to heat ;)
[2:04:47] Quachiri: all named mates died well after this moment. so as of yet they have not been named
[2:04:48] Durwen: It can be symbolic of their defeat. The Aspect of Life surrounded by death
[2:04:54] djadanis: tyrue
[2:04:57] wickedjesther: its the body of last good wow lore writer
[2:05:01] wickedjesther: he died long ago
[2:05:01] Lenitas: Note that a large part of the red dragon flight are directly Alex' children too ofcourse
[2:05:02] TownPortaI: He needs the dracthyr to change time nto him he cant do anything but replay shit for people because if he does anything he will push his self prophecy forward and become mor. Hes AVOIDING self fulling prophecy.,
[2:05:03] shortstackrin: what if someone just messed with him and he's remembering an altered past?
[2:05:16] Line_0: so neltharion was good to them
[2:05:23] Trebled_Mind: Wait how did Krasus die?
[2:05:39] neleaza: krasus died protecting his and Alex's clutch
[2:05:42] xIncryptedx: is this hinting that murazond could have had something to do with deathwing?
[2:05:42] Atomicpanda: anikin would never turn evil
[2:05:47] Nulgar: ALL TRUTHD
[2:05:50] neleaza: if i recall
[2:05:52] Lenitas: @Trebbled_Mind He blew up the Ruby Sanctum with him in it cause all the eggs were corrupted
[2:05:52] Nulgar: *ALL TRUTHS
[2:05:54] Saumur: what if moruzond actually did corrupt deathwing? he can travel the timelines after all
[2:05:55] Runzi333: My truth your truth and the real truth?
[2:05:56] jazwyn: ...oh no, deathwing redemption ark coming
[2:05:57] Fibnkak: wait I thought the light and titans only see one truth. but the old gods see all truths
[2:06:01] BuckyDK: I find it interesting he didn't go into deeper details about N'zoths corruption of DW, when they say that's not the general they remember.. cuz it's not
[2:06:11] Solstrike06: @Trebbled_Mind in the cata Thrall book apparently he was defending Wyrmrest temple eggs from the chromatic corruption
[2:06:13] saedar: SUS PAUSES
[2:06:16] blumberquack: Clearly they don't if you're asking them for info LUL
[2:06:24] LordKurgen: his truth?
[2:06:25] plasticbus: shows all truth, but can't see you name..... gives fake name.
[2:06:28] xIncryptedx: "all truths" is old god af monkaS
[2:06:29] jevinkames6: chekov's stupid?
[2:06:29] LGashly: The only ones who were killed right as deathwing turned was the blue dragonflight, and most of them died
[2:06:30] literally_human_garbage: It's almost like we know he's deceiving her, but she doesn't
[2:06:35] stimpackjunkie: maybe it shows the truth in the past and a possible future?
[2:06:37] Bradykinn: Does Emberthal know that these are not showing the literal past? Maybe Emberthal doesn't know that this isn't a literal recreation of the past
[2:06:50] Bradykinn: Keeping in mind that it is Emberthal asking the question, not the audience
[2:07:00] BuckyDK: Also does anyone want a clock with Nozdormu's eyebrows as the hands?
[2:07:01] Borgirsson: ALL truths. old god vibes man
[2:07:08] bladestitch: Still wondering why Nozdormu (or Murozond) is interested in the Drachtyr.
[2:07:12] wickedjesther: his vidoes are ok. we sshould all sub to nozdromu channel
[2:07:26] Fibnkak: sounds old guys seeing all
[2:07:29] Spykadelic: I think the problem is that they couldn't show us everything in the right timeframe, the line is bad in that context
[2:07:30] Fibnkak: golds
[2:07:32] Fibnkak: gods
[2:07:37] Adrianocirilo: that are His truth
[2:07:37] xIncryptedx: we are gonna get a murazond reveal/semi-reveal next week aren't we
[2:07:42] TownPortaI: @bladestitch because he cant change anything himself and he needs someonething that was hidden untouched by time with him to change it.. if he moves forward he knows he becomes mor....

[2:08:01] saedar: ouch
[2:08:03] bladestitch: @TownPortaI Nice theory.

[2:08:54] TownPortaI: You cant change the past
[2:08:54] Yetik: Nozdormu ? More like SUS-dormu
[2:08:54] LordKurgen: bloody propaganda
[2:08:55] TownPortaI: No
[2:08:59] Babyspinat: S U S A F
[2:09:00] ElyseMori: yeah it's weird cos we would expect to trust Nozdormu
[2:09:03] Kortinas: I am glad that I am not the only person who had theses thoughts when I watched it
[2:09:07] EighthEndless: it was SOOO old god heavy that i think its a red herring
[2:09:08] thunduz: donnny blaze!!
[2:09:16] Spykadelic: I could write off the first line as a production-time problem making a single line awkward. But to follow it up with that second line can't be a mistake
[2:09:17] mxfelwinter: I feel you are falling into the trap most people doing story predictions fall into, thinking everything have more layers than it actually does
[2:09:19] Sch1ey: trust your eyes *shows propaganda*
[2:09:26] salvatorefortolino: plus Nozs eyes I think more and more to resemble the MUR color theme by the way
[2:09:31] Kyferus: nah uhhh
[2:09:40] Adrianocirilo: they dont desapear? o.o
[2:09:44] shortstackrin: I trust Nozdormu but that Murazond...he scares me.
[2:09:47] Harai_Ulfsark: and i hope they follow through with this storytelling, not abandon it at the start like they did with shadowlands
[2:09:48] Runzi333: Could also be that he's showing her the actual real life play by play and it's just us the viewers getting a cut down version?
[2:09:49] bladestitch: haha
[2:09:49] TownPortaI: Noz has himself stuck in time. Stuck in the truth. Because he knows if he moves forward he will somehow end up morazon he needs someone powerful enough or that knows how to stop him when he turns (the hard decision) he cant move forward with time he can only show people past and have them change NOW based on what WE MISSED...
[2:09:51] AlpineHunterGSP: cunt alert

[2:10:57] stimpackjunkie: tali = murazond, old god infected future teller!!!
[2:10:59] thunduz: speculation is fun
[2:11:00] netonkent: well the winter queen looked dodgy for 0.00001 second ha
[2:11:08] TownPortaI: Noz has himself stuck in time. Stuck in the truth. Because he knows if he moves forward he will somehow end up morazon he needs someone powerful enough or that knows how to stop him when he turns (the hard decision) he cant move forward with time he can only show people past and have them change NOW based on what WE MISSED... WHAT WAS right in front of our eyes.
[2:11:12] Spykadelic: It is suspicious regardless of the reason, it could be Murazond, but it could also just be Noz hiding things. Doesn't need a big thing behind it, but also that could be there
[2:11:15] Fibnkak: @TaliesinAndEvitel have you ever done a post mortem on these type of cinematics at the end of an expansion
[2:11:22] MostGratuitous: Tali, there‚Äôs clearly nothing in the cinematic to pick up on. It‚Äôs so empty, you shouldn‚Äôt even watch it.
[2:11:27] rws26: They actually are often conceptually very meta*, they just don't follow-up in game with the ideas, see the n'zoth fish in like hearthstone
[2:11:40] jazwyn: Muzrond and Nozdormu trying to manipulate each other through time would be good novel material
[2:11:43] christabelle: Blizz also loves to tease little things, so examining the layers and the wording *is* important, and I love it! (I also enjoyed it in lit class too, so...maybe it's just not for some people)
[2:11:44] hakunafritatta: I am angry at a streamer that I'm watching doing the thing that the streamer does /s
[2:12:05] Trebled_Mind: Listen even if this is all speculation. We KNOW Teron Gregory is feverishly writing all these things down since he watches the streams. Or at least some blizz writer
[2:12:06] EighthEndless: @hakunafritatta strimmer lol
[2:12:08] TownPortaI: I was saying the past has alreayd happened. He is showing us the truth. He cant go into the future. Because he will turn and he knows that haha. I wasnt saying you cant try and predict the future i was saying Noz cant
[2:12:16] Aeolidae: hakunafritatta, what a wonderful name
[2:12:16] bladestitch: Will we have a spiderman moment with several Noz pointing at eachother?
[2:12:16] TownPortaI: I really hope you werent responding to me lmao.
[2:12:18] bslapp: I predict patch 10.2 is a buddy comedy about this dracthyr and Zappy Boy
[2:12:21] thunduz: @TownPortaI someone or someones powerful enough like a race who could possibly be as mighty as the aspects
[2:12:27] TK241: @TaliesinAndEvitel no the most important this is.... Have you come to bargin colaHmm
[2:12:28] JarJar_Brinkz: Wehh
[2:12:30] Spykadelic: Guys, the discussion and theories are literally the fun of doing this
[2:12:34] TK241: thing*
[2:12:50] hakunafritatta: @Aeolidae :)
[2:12:55] cardrenn: 2 and a half D.... great show, wait no
[2:13:01] Arktoz_OnyxThane: My Dragon Flight CE turned up today woo-hoo
[2:13:03] TownPortaI: WE have more power than noz there. WE CANT PREDICT THE FUTURE.. if noz does he knows he will turn into morozun. THats why hes constant dancing in the sands of time.. THE TRUTH. so he doesnt turn and he can help others lmao.
[2:13:06] lulsbane: Dont try to predict the future of a character that his whole plot is about his future 5Head
[2:13:11] PariahG: Also. Is it too early to mention that Tali WAS in fact right about stuff before.
[2:13:15] TownPortaI: we can try and predict it tho
[2:13:20] EighthEndless: the best evidence of the foreshadowing that blizz does in cinematics is the ink spilling on the map in the jaina/her father cinematic
[2:13:30] transylvanen: You are not wrong, sadly its the result that is a bit cheesy morst of the time but again its subjective.
[2:13:46] menzlo: the drapes are blue there's no such thing as literary criticism!!1!
[2:13:46] TikalValkyrie: blizz wouldent be reminding/teaching us of galakrond and deathwing if they wernt gonna be relevent.  Like the azshara cinematic with nzoth.
[2:13:47] grimetotem: they are literally standing in the image of an eye. come on.
[2:13:49] LGashly: you're media litterate
[2:13:58] LGashly: thats all it is lol
[2:13:59] Milky_J: you mean we have to... trust our eyes?
[2:14:07] Talieer: no, words
[2:14:13] caffeas988: Its high likely that Nozdormu becoming Muruzond is due to pure sacrifice that he accepted.
[2:14:14] Nusu1828: wow's story is hardly high level literature
[2:14:27] Zaelsus: Tali, does that mean that you "use your eyes"? Kappa LUL
[2:14:28] transylvanen: @Nusu1828  not 2022 at least :P
[2:14:29] bslapp: @grimetotem riffGasp
[2:14:30] MissMoxzy: You can be my english teacher Tali
[2:14:41] Kyferus: its no diff to a show or movie trailer
[2:14:42] placeholdername33: Love your cinematic analysis
[2:14:43] taloc44: taloc44 is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel! 
[2:14:43] stimpackjunkie: Lies Tali, the old gods are whispering to you, admit it!!!
[2:14:43] salvatorefortolino: @Milky_J more like open them
[2:14:44] taloc44: taloc44 gifted a Tier 1 sub to s7wede! 
[2:14:44] taloc44: taloc44 gifted a Tier 1 sub to dr_1234! 
[2:14:44] taloc44: taloc44 gifted a Tier 1 sub to zamyrha_! 
[2:14:44] taloc44: taloc44 gifted a Tier 1 sub to jilfranco! 
[2:14:44] taloc44: taloc44 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Rayzodoom! 
[2:14:45] Aeolidae: I must away. have fun everyone.
[2:14:47] Kortinas: The cinematic teams didnt just pull stuff out of their ass and throw it to a board lmao
[2:14:51] jevinkames6: would love nozdormu to turn out to have a long-term sinister plan that is not just he's suddenly Bad Guy
[2:14:58] Nulgar: I always hated book analysis in school, it was always random shit like a red hat symbolizing hope/despair/whatever the author supposedly felt, but here, symbolism is very much intended. You don't just slap together random animations like these without some subtle allusions
[2:15:03] dcmvt: Have you seen the comparison of Deathwing/Neltharion human visage and Gaston from beauty and the beast on r/wow? üòÇüòÇ
[2:15:06] Sch1ey: People's media analysis is unironically so bad these days. I thought people were just memeing when they were saying stop reading into it
[2:15:10] transylvanen: You're not wrong, sadly they introduce the big wait in 1 patch most of the time then move on to the next one.
[2:15:10] Yetik: I really appreciate the work you do for those. Always really interesting, and gives me a fresh way to watch them.
[2:15:15] zamyrha_: @taloc44 Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:15:17] shortstackrin: So Noz has limited power. If he goes for more he becomes Murry. Has to chose between being useless or an absolute threat. Sucks to be him
[2:15:20] Spykadelic: Also, if you don't look at it all, how do you know what is a red herring and what isn't
[2:15:35] ElyseMori: Critical thinking is like an essential part of life
[2:15:48] Browl22: Good evening, hope you all had a nice day so far
[2:15:59] Kyferus: it just means they did a good job getting you there
[2:16:00] EighthEndless: yea, i think this time/truth/believe your eyes comment is soooo over the top its a red herring
[2:16:12] Venjur_Is_Gaming: Venjur_Is_Gaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hello team!
[2:16:19] AlpineHunterGSP: eh no one likes fun wreckers
[2:16:28] salvatorefortolino: @Nulgar I had a fantastic teacher who always embraced our take on the book/poem, apart from presenting the general idea of 'what it meant' written in the educational material
[2:16:41] The_Action_Man: Fit the analysis to their biases
[2:16:44] Jannikhp: is the reason the didn't understand it maybe the age of the viewer ?
[2:16:47] transylvanen: I think people just don't wanna get too excited for the prediction because most of the time it end up being disappointed.
[2:16:50] grimetotem: You ever see someone standing for an hour looking at a painting and becoming infatuated with the meaning behind it. This is the exact same thing. Art is expression, its the best way to express narrative.
[2:16:56] Yetik: Yeah Skepticism is also part of critical thinking. But the developpers have always been keen on adding lots of details in those.
[2:17:19] timeninja888: Well Tali you handled that kind of comment a lot better than Pyromancer ever did
[2:17:35] menzlo: belly
[2:17:42] netonkent: i an worried that over analysing did ruin the story of shadowlands . cause when it wasn't what they predicted they got angry cause they thought there was better
[2:17:42] DarthTaz0: some people just want to be angry
[2:17:47] Nulgar: @Nulgar @salvatorefortolino yeah well I had German teachers that wanted their opinion mirrored, in 10 pages or more, and even if I said that in 1-2 pages, as agreed by my classmates, I still got a D at best
[2:17:47] Spykadelic: I miss the BfA & Legion whisper theories, they were great
[2:17:54] AlpineHunterGSP: @timeninja888 lol so true
[2:18:03] JarJar_Brinkz: And dont read into things, and get mad when its not the thing that happens! PogChamp
[2:18:12] SwimsDry: So Tali, since we have determined Deathwing may be able to hide things from Norzdumu possibly because of Old God influence. Do you think it‚Äôs possible that the old gods are the ones that have hidden his death from him and hidden how he transforms that way he believes it is the only possible outcome? Like what if the old gods have only allowed him to see his transformation into Maurizond.
[2:18:12] neleaza: huh, someone mentioned that Nozdormu wasnt actually present during the war of the ancients. it was his consort.
[2:18:14] Qustav: is this not the old comparison of "artist puts purple here to express x" vs. when you ask artist what this means; "it's purple". you can go both ways, neither is really wrong
[2:18:24] MjolnirRAGE: people are still salty about arthas getting turned into 35 anima
[2:18:33] Sharktribe: He's talking about Nobbel right now ; )
[2:18:33] transylvanen: I think people need to stop deep dive too much into WoW story, because it isn't Tolkien or Martin Writing. Its a simple story meant for everyone. Sadly people who deep too much into WoW's story will end up like Pyro
[2:18:45] salvatorefortolino: @SwimsDry I thought Noz has seen his own death no?
[2:18:47] Kyferus: i agree its fun but im 99% its not whats happening here
[2:18:51] netonkent: we know you would lose your shit if your wronf
[2:18:54] netonkent: wfong
[2:18:55] Spykadelic: @TaliesinAndEvitel I was a whole lot less convinced before those last two lines, now I think you might be right
[2:18:59] netonkent: wouldnt
[2:19:13] EighthEndless: tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight
[2:19:16] TheDeekins: Halbrand trikS
[2:19:19] placeholdername33: Being wrong is fun!
[2:19:21] netonkent: yep your level headed
[2:19:22] Browl22: Well, luckily you are never wrong :P
[2:19:25] wickedjesther: you did quit wow tho. ragequit?
[2:19:28] Nulgar: I want Nozdormu to pull a River and trick his way out of his inevitable "demise"
[2:19:33] schlakt: You are never wrong Tali
[2:19:35] nejore: being wrong is part of the fun of speculating
[2:19:38] rws26: Only thing we should be speculating on is Paul Pelosi.
[2:19:40] shortstackrin: Have the finished that brick wall yet?
[2:19:40] salvatorefortolino: noone should care, it would make the world a better place
[2:19:44] Vidaloo: Tbf I just don't like speculating on time travelling because it's never done quite right, and Nozdormu too
[2:19:45] Saumur: But you surely love being right. Just as you singlehandedly predicted all of BfA
[2:19:46] TheDeekins: yeah that's me all over lol
[2:19:55] LGashly: @rws26 oh god can we not
[2:19:59] rohdey: So when do we get Tinkerers @taliesinandevitel Kappa
[2:20:01] drunken_werewolf_hunter: @taliesinandevitel I am curious if this premonition that can't be seen will make norsdomu be a good guy through all of it instead of a bad guy.
[2:20:02] bladestitch: It's fun to speculate and look backa at failed theories.
[2:20:04] Runzi333: People can and should have headcanons if that's what they like to do, it can be very fun! but yeah they should also understand they may be wrong and that's also okay and not the end of the world
[2:20:08] MostGratuitous: I think there‚Äôs something going on in the community right now where a lot of it *wants* to be angry at WoW and will grab at any reason to be so.
[2:20:09] MjolnirRAGE: its a can of worms
[2:20:17] netonkent: sorry my English is bad. too bad that I'm English ha
[2:20:27] Kyferus: yeah i feel that was something that happen to pyro he got really into his own story he was making, and then was angry when the story was straight forward
[2:20:33] halux_: it worked in the end of mop though
[2:20:34] Talieer: accepting that you're wrong is also acknowledging what is right
[2:20:40] salvatorefortolino: @spontaneoussouffle I asked this at the beginning, he shows it too, 2 rowd missing mortar on the bottom, lighting was purchased, not yet installed
[2:20:40] The_Action_Man: Chrono Trigger was great because Time Travel was the central mechanic of the game. When it's tossed in, it usually feels ad
[2:20:50] halux_: timeless isle worked
[2:20:55] nejore: Yhea the CoT dungeonss were always great
[2:20:59] Vidaloo: Yeah absolutely, different realities is sort of different but when you time travel in your own dimension suddenly the narrative becomes so hard to explain haha
[2:21:06] MorninMews: WOD went wrong by trying to do different reality and time travel simultaneously, shoulda just stuck to time travel :(
[2:21:07] JorickNP: JorickNP subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:21:14] MjolnirRAGE: Just drink the Kool Aid
[2:21:22] BuckyDK: I went for a shit and we haven't moved an inch lmao, good show.
[2:21:24] nejore: its way to suss
[2:21:43] Runzi333: Yep people should just write fanfics and not be so salty about other writers making other choices not every story is for every reader
[2:21:48] azrael962000: he means Trust me
[2:21:52] salvatorefortolino: @MorninMews but that's the point - who knows how many of those happened what with the Infinite flight
[2:22:14] stimpackjunkie: if only one could see whispers
[2:22:15] smashwow: yeah just open your eyes fam Kappa
[2:22:16] Browl22: My guess would be that this is Murozond. Nozdormu is so shady in these cinematics
[2:22:22] Nulgar: @MorninMews should've just done pieces of Outland drifting back, with Orcs and Ogres (Goria!), claiming to be the children of the Warlords, and thus the rightful rulers of Outland
[2:22:25] Iwony: There is a reason why it is said : Looks can be deceiving
[2:22:29] Browl22: This "Trust me bro" mentality
[2:22:52] gurkenglashalbvoll: "how can mirrors be real if you're eyes aren't real?"
[2:22:52] Babyspinat: And we are seeing the cinematics with OUR EYES right now!!!!111
[2:23:03] Saumur: But you can trust your eyes, if you hvae a hell lot of them! #EmbraceNzoth
[2:23:09] shortstackrin: is the whole thing about old gods is "SEEING" them causes madness?
[2:23:16] Helltz68: all truths like the void?
[2:23:24] tjiani_: I only realize now, that neltharion literally chose his gamertag for his evil guy name. xXDEATHWINGXx
[2:23:31] weplord: he only said it because the other doubted Deathwings betrayal. No more no less
[2:23:31] gurkenglashalbvoll: Didn't farm enough insight
[2:23:39] Beanbeanpouch: deathwing with the 10/10 olympic dive
[2:23:45] Harai_Ulfsark: i know ill be using my Servant of N'zoth title day 1 on my dracthyr LUL
[2:23:46] azrael962000: do you have a degree from university?
[2:24:02] jevinkames6: nozdormu deal with the old gods to give them deathwing in exchange for Infinite powers?
[2:24:04] Browl22: The ways of time show only truths? Just like the light? Just like the void?
[2:24:06] Babyspinat: 1.5/10 olympic dive
[2:24:28] MjolnirRAGE: Are there any Il'gynoth whispers that could relate to Nozdormu?
[2:24:32] DataDonut: I don't recognize it, I churned in the first patch of Cata
[2:24:32] siegeorc: Damn the music for that though!
[2:24:35] Line_0: i think they denoate changes in time by restarting the sands of time
[2:24:38] Line_0: denote
[2:24:39] siegeorc: The strings going wild
[2:24:53] salvatorefortolino: @Browl22 good point if you mean that we haven't met yet someone objective
[2:24:58] gurkenglashalbvoll: he had been defeated twice before he was defeated for the last time in Cata
[2:24:59] redspike15: narrative propaganda
[2:25:02] blumberquack: @MjolnirRAGE Oh god, we're never gonna let that guy go are we LUL
[2:25:08] Milky_J: each grain of sand is 100 years
[2:25:24] Nusu1828: History's written by the victors and all that
[2:25:31] MjolnirRAGE: @MjolnirRAGE never hahahahah
[2:25:49] Harai_Ulfsark: iggy whispers are so fun tho
[2:25:50] Line_0: madness
[2:26:23] Talieer: and emphasizing the similarity between dragon soul beam and the beam from heart of azeroth coming in just a bit
[2:26:27] Line_0: it can still inspire designs
[2:26:28] TheChef08: Hey look, another example of transformation and not being able to trust your eyes
[2:26:34] stimpackjunkie: hearthstone has plenty of cannons
[2:26:36] netonkent: maybe it should be
[2:26:37] kameleon0728: RAAAAAAAAAAAAFAm
[2:26:41] proffknight: hearthstone has influenced cannon a lot
[2:26:47] JoeTheRedcoat: I thought you said "Hearthstone's not camp" for a minute there.
[2:26:49] shortstackrin: who said the art wasn't canon?
[2:26:54] rohdey: I‚Äôve had the feeling that Hearthstone foreshadows what is to come in WoW
[2:27:02] s7wede: half of the explorers league comes from HS at this point and they are in DF
[2:27:03] UncleJarf: Hearthstone revealed the tortollans as well
[2:27:04] Pryy: Pryy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months, currently on a 44 month streak! Good Evening
[2:27:06] Babyspinat: just crosspromotion from activision
[2:27:14] Wirhl: Hearthstone might not be cannon but it is WoW and there is no reason why Blizz can pull from it and make it cannon
[2:27:17] TownPortaI: :(
[2:27:23] Sombregard: rAFFAM?
[2:27:27] rohdey: @s7wede they were in Mechagon too during Bfa
[2:27:34] warwych_druchii: I want the three Hstone factions in Gadgetzan.. would be so cool as a questing hub hobbsCardburn hobbsCardburn
[2:27:34] Spykadelic: It is like when you talked about the watchers, they are made to evoke a sense of history in us. So I don't see why they wouldn't reference Hearthstone to evoke feelings in us too
[2:27:34] KiloEagle: KiloEagle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[2:27:37] qolafrog: is reno jackson aka renogos in dragonflight?
[2:27:46] fatbat8: fatbat8 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! whaddup
[2:27:46] placeholdername33: Vulpera originated in hearthstone didn't they? Or am I wrong about that
[2:27:47] christabelle: Well, Hearthstone is an in-universe game that people *in* Azeroth play. So what happens IN Hearthstone isn't canon, just like Tolkien's books aren't canon for us, despite it being an alternate earth.  (Also Blizz just loves to drop references to their own games in their other games.)
[2:27:53] EighthEndless: @qolafrog yes
[2:27:53] netonkent: how expensive do you think these cinematic would be ? like half the cost of a normal one maybe?
[2:28:08] djadanis: the galakrond card in hearthstone has different images depending on which class resurrects him
[2:28:18] im_capy: Hearthstone wotlk video was some kick ass art style too
[2:28:27] djadanis: true true
[2:28:33] MostGratuitous: Honestly, the teams using hearthstone as a way ti experiment with the narrative, that‚Äôs good.
[2:28:35] ExPonric: i mean if he doesn't try to resurrect him, they should at least put in an easter egg or joke about him wanting to
[2:28:38] EighthEndless: @im_capy arthas returns #Confirmed
[2:28:46] shaxxtv: did you watch chapter  2?
[2:28:53] LGashly: @im_capy hype
[2:29:00] MorninMews: It's like they're opening the door to hearthstone just being alternate/parallel realities
[2:29:04] pomi2137: Just like nozdormu is by...
[2:29:04] NinjAnola: hello
[2:29:06] AlpineHunterGSP: in this expansion
[2:29:09] Ellycat1: Interestingly, Murozond's last line is "Aman'thul... What I have seen..." And now Nozdormu is off to see something he was unable to see normally. danHmm
[2:29:11] gurkenglashalbvoll: did C'thun ever corrupt anything? Poor buy never had the chance
[2:29:13] im_capy: @EighthEndless "no king rules forever"
[2:29:15] rohdey: Speaking of Hearthstone, I took the Shudderwock, to Poland Kappa
[2:29:17] NiteOwl11617: So where's the Old Gold this expac?
[2:29:18] Trebled_Mind: Weren‚Äôt they planning on adding the Hearthstone Tavern into wow? What happened to that?
[2:29:25] kostbobler: Damn dragons and old gods...
[2:29:27] Estralmage: üëÄ
[2:29:36] Harai_Ulfsark: @gurkenglashalbvoll the qiraji
[2:29:36] Wunani: Here is what is confusing.  Galakrond was said to be growing a bunch of eyes but YOGG is the beast of 1000 maws he just had mouths all over the place
[2:29:49] The_Action_Man: just like the rest of us mortal races
[2:29:53] skeletonetiquette: still of the belief that Maldraxxus is Galakrond
[2:29:56] Solstrike06: speaking of non-canon HS lore, did you guys know Reno Jackson is a blue dragon? will that come up? idk
[2:30:03] shaxxtv: where do you see chapter 2???
[2:30:06] Saumur: Ahh, your miswording remembered me of something! Names of Dragons indicate something. -asza are all female red dragons, for instance. And -ond seems to be related to Infinite Dragons. So what about GalakrOND?
[2:30:19] NinjAnola: what cinematic is this?
[2:30:28] im_capy: Wonder if we will see any more of Thrall with his mom in DF
[2:30:29] s7wede: I have a feeling that The dracthyr are going to be key in bridging the timeliness. End Times made no mention of Dracthyr so with their inclusion it's proof that time can be changed.
[2:30:30] deboots: Moses, not Jesus right?
[2:30:31] AlpineHunterGSP: balls* massive red balls*
[2:30:32] rumocrytuf: Didn't Thrall's wife(?) have a kid on the way at the end of Cata? Whatever happened to them?
[2:30:33] Yetik: his beautifull BALLS
[2:30:38] Zaelsus: Bit of a tinfoil hat meme but imagine if this is Murozond and the next one has Nozdormu appear and they have a recreation of that multiple spiderman meme
[2:30:56] GabrielBelinazo: in the end of the boat fight
[2:31:07] LewsTherinTelefrag: that's what ends the spine fight, yeah
[2:31:11] bigoldmeatpie: before spine and manicure of deathwing, yeah
[2:31:13] LewsTherinTelefrag: I've run that raid too many times...
[2:31:14] salvatorefortolino: reuse
[2:31:15] bladestitch: Yeah.
[2:31:15] salvatorefortolino: yes!
[2:31:15] gurkenglashalbvoll: @Harai_Ulfsark They already were old god creations
[2:31:16] P4weZ: ye
[2:31:21] Line_0: flashback
[2:31:23] aladinsane25: Still now convinced Neltharion is Deathwing
[2:31:25] aladinsane25: Not
[2:31:32] Osirisson: @rumocrytuf Pretty sure last we heard they where living back in Nagrand. But I might be wrong
[2:31:47] EighthEndless: @rumocrytuf both of their kids were on outland during bfa.  its unknown if they came back to azeroth with thrall when he came back in BFA
[2:32:00] salvatorefortolino: maybe the template Mur/Noz ran out of new images :D
[2:32:11] salvatorefortolino: uses*
[2:32:15] im_capy: catching up new players with the story as well
[2:32:16] Nirial: Seems unnecessary to do a flashback within the same clip. I thought they re-empowered it again for the dragonsoul raid didn't they?
[2:32:26] Wirhl: Pretty sure that is how the Aspects are going to get their power back
[2:32:42] EighthEndless: dragon soul/drakthyr: created to destroy life, but can be used to protect life
[2:32:48] shaxxtv: corruption season inc boys!!!
[2:33:01] Browl22: They are ok, they drank the mind-control water
[2:33:05] BlackRockWednesday: I want to frame so many of these screencaps
[2:33:11] JarJar_Brinkz: @Nirial unnecessary for what?
[2:33:16] Bumsbatze: so maybe Rafam resurrecting Galakrond with the Dragon Soul? ..
[2:33:20] Angistar: didn't we see a seed of some sort in legion?
[2:33:25] grimetotem: Ember - Burning remnants. Thal - Of Earth. I'm gonna keep saying it because it's so fucking relevant
[2:33:28] Spykadelic: Perhaps the Dragons Primal connection is a conduit that the Old Gods can exploit so all dragons are potentially corruptable
[2:33:29] salvatorefortolino: 1/6th isn't it? if you add human too
[2:33:48] The_Action_Man: I think Neltarion's corruption began as sson as he was made an Aspect and given domain over earth
[2:34:11] codicier: tbh its more almost more notable if a dragon aspect HASNT been corrupted or gone mad than if they have XD
[2:34:22] BlackRockWednesday: RIP
[2:34:25] The_Cosmic_Nova: the Dracthyr dont use black dragon magic, only the other four...is this because the black dragon one is corrupted like you say?
[2:34:25] Lerosyl: His eyes are very blue, matching murozonds color palette
[2:34:27] Line_0: very rip
[2:34:32] BlackRockWednesday: Can vouch. Was there.
[2:34:33] im_capy: Wrathion also knew all about the corruption in BFA when talking to Anduin ahead of everyone else
[2:34:35] JarJar_Brinkz: Nozdormu got enough forehead to last every future and past in the sands of time
[2:34:37] menzlo: he chose that facial hair damn
[2:34:39] Abruhcadabro: Alex isn't in her dragon bikini in these videos, like her model had in WotLK and Cata, so he is editing his Power Point Presentation that he's giving her.
[2:34:40] fearghusson: fearghusson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[2:34:41] shortstackrin: I don't remember but what was desthwing gonna do with that power?
[2:34:49] AlpineHunterGSP: or is he\
[2:35:00] Harai_Ulfsark: @The_Cosmic_Nova they have a root that is black dragon power
[2:35:06] kreten97: Most of it
[2:35:24] salvatorefortolino: and again here not only looks sad but musing in the same time like 'is that what I'd do too eventually'
[2:35:45] im_capy: Titan influenced "order"
[2:35:47] The_Cosmic_Nova: @The_Cosmic_Nova but their specs use specifically red /blue and green/bronze The specs dont list black as an essence they use
[2:35:47] shortstackrin: why are his eyebrows so rigidü§£
[2:35:51] xIncryptedx: nozdormu is all about stopping threats to the planet azeroth. i wonder what would happen if he found out titan's were planning on destroying the planet to birth the titan
[2:35:59] xIncryptedx: titans*
[2:36:01] Spykadelic: I hope he is right, cause we murdered Deathwing too, so we would be in trouble too!
[2:36:11] grimetotem: @spontaneoussouffle  Just happy to see you
[2:36:13] Browl22: I guess he suffers from his own actions himself and therefore has to soothe himself
[2:36:22] salvatorefortolino: @xIncryptedx i love this point
[2:36:22] Word08: tneKhadgarWut_TK
[2:36:25] netonkent: I never thought they wouldnt be immortal now
[2:36:36] Azallus: The way Nozdormu tells this story,  Neltharion already called himself Deathwing by the time he asked the other Aspects for power. Now, it might just be me, but if a friend of mine is like: "I now call myself Monseiur Murderkill, please, lend me your power!", perhaps that ain't a good idea.
[2:36:38] EighthEndless: i mean, the aspects have been involved in 3 major fights in 10k years, it seems like they keep to themselves except when the situation is world-ending-serious lol
[2:36:44] JarJar_Brinkz: Dracthyr are huge though, i love it
[2:36:49] Kyferus: Murozond!
[2:36:52] Nirial: I don't think Emberthal will be a baddie. I think she will feel responsible for Murozond's creation
[2:36:53] menzlo: only you can prevent forest fires
[2:36:56] djadanis: the delivery in his last line is so ominous and menacing
[2:37:00] bigoldmeatpie: i'm really excited for the dracthyr starting zone. i've avoided all of the leveling and dracthyr stuff on beta
[2:37:03] wickedjesther: HE wants to see how deatwing was corrupted
[2:37:06] Yetik: Very pog
[2:37:06] salvatorefortolino: long reamined hidden from me - so it shouldn't be his death right? Isn't it how Murozond was created??
[2:37:08] xIncryptedx: i now need to hibernate until next tuesday
[2:37:11] wickedjesther: to avoid it
[2:37:14] Haskins14780: the memory morazond is hiding from him which his  death
[2:37:22] Line_0: this moment is great
[2:37:27] shaxxtv: he is galakron
[2:37:28] xIncryptedx: we all know what the moment does but not what it is
[2:37:30] The_Action_Man: What actually causes Nozdormu to turn?
[2:37:32] Adrianocirilo: his turnin
[2:37:35] menzlo: the moment he turns to murazond
[2:37:35] JarJar_Brinkz: Me not getting the Headless horseman mount FeelsBadMan
[2:37:38] kameleon0728: its joe
[2:37:38] djadanis: this place is the forbidden reach right?
[2:37:39] Trebled_Mind: Creation of the Dracthyr
[2:37:45] Crazyyelir: when nozdormu turns to murazond
[2:37:46] SisterblissUK: his death
[2:37:47] CuVulpi: its gotta be what causes him to turn bad
[2:37:47] Durwen: Famously, he doesn't know how he turns
[2:37:49] Ceranis_: The Death of Nozdormu
[2:37:50] onetoughkitty: His corruption or death
[2:37:51] salvatorefortolino: or maybe Deathwing does
[2:37:55] Line_0: i think its his death or when he becomes murozond
[2:38:01] Iwony: nice picture with to many windows
[2:38:02] shortstackrin: someone just said it, the first time the old gods contact.
[2:38:03] Haskins14780: i dont think he could take all the stress from the titans being bad
[2:38:05] Abruhcadabro: Creation of the Drakthyr as a secret army against the other flights
[2:38:05] bladestitch: I fully expect that the last one next week will completely pull the rug out from us and do something we couldn't ever guess.
[2:38:06] SleepyPlant2: what do you think is that room they are standing in? it seems interesting
[2:38:07] Nirial: Has to be what causes him to turn. once he sees what turns him mad, he turns
[2:38:11] Kyferus: Titan parental controls, he cant access paperview
[2:38:13] Zaelsus: On a side note for the final image of Nozdormy @TaliesinAndEvitel , could you say that this room is like a maze (similar to the paths of time) which he cannot traverse, but Emberthal can and therefore let him find that which he cannot see?
[2:38:14] Iwony: many windows many possibilities
[2:38:18] Haskins14780: so his mind want mad
[2:38:21] Talieer: if dracthyr has a seed of corruption, is that why he can't tell their names? Kappa
[2:38:23] EighthEndless: @Line_0 he was there for his death.  so were we.  we killed him in the end time dungeon.  so its def not a secret lol
[2:38:25] Harai_Ulfsark: but what about deaths of chromie? LUL
[2:38:25] Haskins14780: went*
[2:38:47] lfvre: To me this is the titans that hide things from him
[2:38:50] Line_0: @EighthEndless that death wont happen now though, he will have a new death that he might not know about, if he even dies
[2:38:57] Lenitas: Now I'm just thinking "Aspect of Dirt"
[2:39:00] Nulgar: @Line_0 @EighthEndless Nozdormu's "death" would be turning into Murozond, and I doubt he can see beyond that point
[2:39:02] Haskins14780: i think he needs the drakthyr because they were there after his death?
[2:39:04] salvatorefortolino: drink Talli
[2:39:10] Uthanman: Imagine if it was Murozond that travelled back and fascilitated Deathwings corruption...
[2:39:11] EighthEndless: @Line_0 we dont know that.  tali has guessed that, but it doesnt mean it wont happen now.
[2:39:17] bladestitch: Doors to many places.
[2:39:18] djadanis: it looks like where dracthyr are born/created
[2:39:23] chlorophyllkid: ruby life pools
[2:39:24] djadanis: like nests on a wall
[2:39:25] Ellycat1: Perhaps Aman'thul's gift to nozdormu specifically hid part of the timelines to prevent him from losing his mind/betraying them. ü§î
[2:39:26] djadanis: for dracthyr
[2:39:31] SleepyPlant2: looks like a room with viewing areas
[2:39:33] Haskins14780: the graves from  lord of the rings lol
[2:39:34] EighthEndless: @Uthanman oooo i like this, and he taught deathwing how to hide shit from nozdormu!
[2:39:35] Line_0: @EighthEndless thats just my own opinion. I dont think the end time events will happen now
[2:39:38] shortstackrin: that's just Blackrock inner inner inner depths
[2:39:43] Abruhcadabro: Deathwing didn't create the Drakthyr, he FOUND them. The Titans created them to replace the Aspects.
[2:39:46] Caenogenesis: is there one dragon per door in here
[2:39:47] SleepyPlant2: some sort of meeting room?
[2:40:08] Line_0: @EighthEndless so basically lots is unknown to nozdormu now. There are things he cant see
[2:40:08] nejore: na man. he was trying to avoid the word prison
[2:40:09] Chasdamm: @Ellycat1 you mean to keep him "loyal" to the Titan-ways?
[2:40:15] besidethesky: Hi i wanna try  wow for first time. Should i play retail or the classic?
[2:40:16] njerxs: confinement, right?
[2:40:35] salvatorefortolino: yes very interesting word that
[2:40:39] EighthEndless: @besidethesky retail, no question
[2:40:41] McShloven: @besidethesky probalby retail.
[2:40:58] guy_handsome: A creche
[2:40:59] SisterblissUK: @besidethesky retail
[2:40:59] djadanis: can't wait for next video
[2:41:02] Ellycat1: Exactly Chasdamm, he calls out for Aman'thul at the moment of his death in end time instance.
[2:41:06] Harai_Ulfsark: black mud pools
[2:41:09] camba4ever: right, so thats the moment, the moment of their creation
[2:41:12] Haskins14780: when do we get the collectors edition delivered?
[2:41:14] EighthEndless: classic is objectively a bad game.  its a ton of fun if you have the nostalgia, but without 100 addons, its a bad game compared to retail
[2:41:30] The_Action_Man: aren't all of the mortal races carrying that seed too?
[2:41:32] im_capy: I wonder if the Primus and Nozdormu hang out, with the whole timey whimy stuff
[2:41:46] CuVulpi: Murazond
[2:41:47] shortstackrin: maybe he can't find his roku remote and needs help
[2:41:50] tjiani_: might be a stretch, but what if all the aspects are bound to get corrupted. malygos, neltharion and ysera all got corrupted and we know nozdormu will be. that leaves alexstraza
[2:41:50] SleepyPlant2: do you think were going to get a clone wars order 66 twist with the non player dracthyr?
[2:41:53] besidethesky: I mean i have no idea about thus game so i guess retail alrighty thanks you im gonna try retail
[2:41:53] Pvm_Dvn: Will this final vision be the "revelation" which pushes him over the edge to the dark side? will we see that transformation in the cinematic?
[2:41:54] Rolaz: Maybe artefact from Uldaman? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[2:41:56] bladestitch: Excited to see what it leads to next week.
[2:42:01] LGashly: remember when wrathion supposedly killed EVERY black dragon?? and now theres like . . a lot of them left somehow???
[2:42:02] Azallus: He COULD be looking into what corrupted Galakrond.
[2:42:02] Spykadelic: Could be what sends him mad, so maybe a titan secret?
[2:42:04] MorninMews: the moment he turned into murozond?
[2:42:05] Tamz_tv: he's wondering what happened to all those turtles which made it to the water
[2:42:06] SisterblissUK: @besidethesky we have a 50% exp buff on leveling atm, so it will be fast for you.. but the stories might be a bit jumbled lol
[2:42:09] Saumur: If he was Moruzond probably the ability to hide things from is former self
[2:42:11] besidethesky: Is there any class like water or ice mage?
[2:42:15] MikeyGy: i like the juxtaposition of Nozdormu leading Emberthal in the place that is her home, adds to the growing sinister atmosphere @TaliesinAndEvitel
[2:42:17] netonkent: maybe the first ones
[2:42:20] LGashly: like I get abyssian and ebon horn . . but where did all these other black dragons who are "voting" come form???
[2:42:21] menzlo: he wants to understand how deathwing got corrupted so he can prevent his own
[2:42:31] lulsbane: nah
[2:42:36] SwimsDry: A new artifact weapon? Perhaps lol
[2:42:39] EighthEndless: someone earlier said that murazond goes back in time and helps corrupt deathwing, which could be why deathwing could hide stuff from nozdormu, murazond taught him!
[2:42:44] gangst3rpanda: Do we know why the dracthyr were sealed originally?
[2:42:44] Haskins14780: yea she was the first awake
[2:42:45] CuVulpi: or perhaps endgame of the Titan's plans
[2:42:48] DonCuzu: @TaliesinAndEvitel I think its why the Black dragonflight has always experimented with creating "superdragons" from a mix of all the aspects. I am sure, the black dragons either know something (about the titans?) that has made them try to create these super soldiers to fulfill something
[2:42:49] Nusu1828: he wants to learn how to create the infinite dragonflight
[2:42:53] salvatorefortolino: because we don't know WHY they were really created
[2:42:53] Uthanman: @taliesinandevitel Lorewise Murozond hasn't actually been behind anything bad that actually succeeded as far as we know, right? I imagine it might be revealed he was pulling the strings behind something important, such as Neltharion becoming Deathwing.
[2:42:55] XanderDarks: Yasera could still be corrupted by the void i think @TaliesinAndEvitel  void seed is still in the dream
[2:42:56] TrashmasterRihi: Maybe wants to know for what the Dracthyr were made for?
[2:42:56] shortstackrin: does notdormu have a consort?ü§î
[2:43:01] Haskins14780: then it might go onto the others being released
[2:43:02] SisterblissUK: @besidethesky @besidethesky frost mage for sure.. or if you want the elements to play with try a shaman
[2:43:02] Tiroxina: I think it's when he turned into Muro, it seems so personal, 'a crucial moment hidden from ME'
[2:43:06] azrael962000: where he left his 10mm socket
[2:43:08] Adrianocirilo: where is noz on dragonflight?
[2:43:12] Azallus: @EighthEndless Yes, it is QUITE possible Nozdormu here -is- Murozond already, and is doing just that.
[2:43:14] GugsArch: Doors for multiple futures
[2:43:20] Zaelsus: To create the Infinite Dragonflight?
[2:43:28] HavocHardt: @spontaneoussouffle They all do. One of the ones resting in Caverns is labled as such
[2:43:29] Spykadelic: He is going to find out how much of a dick Odyn is and be all like 'hell no' and that is how Murazond is actually the good guy
[2:43:30] Dagraine: Nozdormu needs Emberthal to show him where he forgot his keys, the one thing that he cant find KEKW
[2:43:36] l0nnl0v: Mby he want to know how Deathwing could use all dragons powers without them knowing?
[2:43:38] timeninja888: i would love if nozdormu's attempts to prevent himself becoming murozond CAUSES it
[2:43:39] CottonEyeGoat: ding!
[2:43:42] Trebled_Mind: I agree, creation of the Dracthyr is most likely. Follows the story beats. Any other ‚Äúmoment‚Äù would feel out of place for what the videos are trying to tell.
[2:43:46] besidethesky: @sisterblissuk frost mage sounds awesome ill google about it thanks . In mmos im all in for water or ice mage
[2:43:55] chlorophyllkid: what if there is an event during the expansion that turns him
[2:43:55] schlakt: Kinda like Magni in BFA?
[2:44:00] SisterblissUK: @besidethesky :)
[2:44:07] Azallus: He wants to see how the Dracthyr was made, so he can create the infinite dragonflight!
[2:44:24] EighthEndless: @besidethesky frost is my main, but for a first timer i recommend beast mastery hunter.  frost will server you well, but BM is a great intro spec
[2:44:26] grimetotem: In the preview didn't we see an infinite dragon, we're yet to see that
[2:44:26] Adrianocirilo: creating hiz infinite army?
[2:44:30] Azallus: Ermagerd, that is totally plausible.
[2:44:31] kostbobler: "Nos dont know how to get some"
[2:44:32] menzlo: thats a fun idea
[2:44:33] netonkent: maybe because they the power of the flight without the Titian giving them the powers
[2:44:36] Tiroxina: so the infinites are just Walmart dracthyr
[2:44:37] halux_: he wants to create the infinites
[2:44:41] skoojare: might be stupid but can't they travel through time, then in theory he can have a infinite army?
[2:45:06] camba4ever: in a secret 4th cinematic
[2:45:06] djadanis: isn't infinite dragonflight infinite because he can just retake his dead soldiers from back when they were still alive?
[2:45:10] shortstackrin: üí° What if he wants to make a vessel that can live after becoming Murazond? üò¨
[2:45:14] evilgnome42: So was Nefarian's Drakonoids - an attempt to remake the Drakthir?
[2:45:15] besidethesky: @eighthendless if i start as a beastmasterhunter i can change my class later to frostmage?
[2:45:16] Babyspinat: He wants to know how to escape the 1 Dracthyr pro Realm thing to create more ALTS!
[2:45:22] xIncryptedx: i need a murazond v nozdormu fight cinematic now
[2:45:23] Trebled_Mind: Dracthyr would make perfect Time Agents. Think of it as Murozond‚Äôs version of Dreadlords
[2:45:28] Sharktribe: There is an infinite color scheme available to Drakthyr, keep in mind
[2:45:28] MexulTV: Grasping at straws here: maybe he wants to see how DW created the dracthyr. If the dracthyr came to be from DW "elevating" protodrakes in his own way, like the titans once did for the aspects?
[2:45:29] djadanis: man i actually don't know much about dragon lore i need to get up to date
[2:45:43] EighthEndless: @maikeull yea, its like time travel fel-battery-twisting-nether
[2:45:49] ebrahim_91: thats a fucking amazing theory I am already convinced
[2:45:54] Gebruiksvoorwerp: Would you, knowing that your goals will change in the future, without knowing how or why, still try to thwart future-yous plans. What if future you has a valid reason and you ruin the world trying to stop him
[2:46:01] djadanis: okay thanks :D
[2:46:04] bladestitch: Are Drachtyr a little like Chromatic Dragons given they can use different flights abiliteis?
[2:46:07] salvatorefortolino: i agree
[2:46:09] The_Action_Man: If Nozdormu is very present in DF, i twould be SUPER weird if we learn he's Murazond already
[2:46:13] Trebled_Mind: Dracthyr would make perfect Time Agents. Think of it as Murozond‚Äôs version of Dreadlords
[2:46:20] DonCuzu: Would be kinda fun if the Black Drake s were trying to do the right thing all along, because the Old Gods actually revealed the "truth" about the Titans, so they knew all along, and were trying to fight back against the Titans, and the world order as we know it
[2:46:20] netonkent: Tali just trust your eyes üòù
[2:46:27] CuVulpi: I think he's going to try and find out the titans game plan, and that's what drives him insane turning him to murozond
[2:46:29] Solstrike06: @besidethesky no, you can only change specs within a class (with hunter and mage being different classes so you cant change) IMO just go mage if you think youll enjoy it! youll have a lot more fun on a character you like
[2:46:30] Dagraine: In theory the visage form can look like anything no matter if Murozond or Nozdormu so it is plausible
[2:46:31] xIncryptedx: @Gebruiksvoorwerp i was just thinking about this. i don't see how that action would ever make sense unless your future self was mentally compromised somehow
[2:46:36] EighthEndless: there is only when he literally says "my name is nozdormu," but other than that it can def be murazond
[2:46:37] bigoldmeatpie: i know it won't be this. but i'd love it if noz finds out what changes him and he tries to stop it from happening and that actually causes it to happen
[2:46:41] MikeyGy: he sure is looking for something down there
[2:46:54] l0nnl0v: How can dracthyr have power from all flight without all of the other aspect  knowing it
[2:47:08] besidethesky: @solstrike06 water ice mages is my way to go in every mmo i ve played
[2:47:08] guy_handsome: I like emberthals design
[2:47:09] djadanis: @bladestitch i believe i've read that chromatic dragons are a failed attempt to recreate dracthyrs
[2:47:24] besidethesky: Ill google about frostmage and beasthunter
[2:47:25] bleedout35: it would be cool to see murozond revealed in cinematics while keeping the player character in the dark although we would "know"
[2:47:27] ishmael_euler: The Pandaria ones had a continuous plot
[2:47:32] besidethesky: Thank you all
[2:47:39] avvaari: @l0nnl0v Deathwing probably used the dragon soul with all the aspects powers in it to make the drakthyr
[2:47:40] salvatorefortolino: do we really know what moment in time this cinematic is taking place exactly??
[2:47:40] EighthEndless: @l0nnl0v i still think deathwing used the dragon soul to empower/awaken the dracthyr (whom he had created slowly over time, and just used the dragon soul to actually power them up)
[2:48:00] besidethesky: All servers are same? I m from europe should i choose any specific server?
[2:48:01] EighthEndless: @salvatorefortolino no
[2:48:05] Runzi333: The chromatics failed because corruption where Dracthyr don't have corruption maybe?
[2:48:14] Dagraine: what if the third cinematic ends with Nozdormu's eyes slightly shifting with the infinite color palette to just give a little hint of things going beneath the surface
[2:48:17] besidethesky: I wanna play night elf
[2:48:26] EighthEndless: @besidethesky all are pretty much the same.  RP servers have naming restrictions.
[2:48:37] MorninMews: But we have access to see these cinematics pretty early on in the beta though don't we?
[2:49:00] Nulgar: think so? I'd say ambiguity would do more
[2:49:11] djadanis: inb4 every appearance of nozdormu gets replaced by murozond in game after next week's video
[2:49:14] menzlo: it would mean we couldn't see his corruption in real time
[2:49:17] Ellycat1: I think a reveal would be better saved for during the expansion.
[2:49:20] Bradykinn: It feels too early for a Murozond reveal, even if he is Murozond at this point. This presumably happens early after Nozdormu got to the isles, and we have the whole questing with the player with him, and other more immediate threats. I feel like Murozond would be a 10.1 or 10.2 reveal
[2:49:20] camba4ever: A man meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it
[2:49:23] salvatorefortolino: @l0nnl0v but Emberthal has good memories of DW, meaning they had a period they existed while he wasn't acting up, no?
[2:49:31] Durwen: We're supposed to not know who the bad guy is until the end of the raid. So no Murozond reveal, I'm afraid
[2:49:33] LGashly: wait you DONT see all of time??? fuck you had me convinced you did with how often you're right
[2:49:53] tjiani_: do you think murozond is related to the raszageth cultists?
[2:50:03] EighthEndless: ion did say that we would know who the big bad is by the end of the raid, so i think we will get the reveal as the final raid cinematic, not now imo
[2:50:05] timeninja888: I thought that the dracthyr cinematic came out with the dracthyr release? But i thought the dracthyr came out on the 15th?
[2:50:08] HavocHardt: I have a suspicion that talking about the dragon soul, losing their powers, the fact the dragon souls itself required a mortal to wield. It's possible he could be trying to find whether the ambitious mortal essence they clearly have may have lingering residue of that initial titan gift.
[2:50:20] LGashly: DING
[2:50:20] MikeyGy: on the other hand, what if he is trying to find how were the Dracthyr imprisoned to lock himself up and cheatdestiny
[2:50:23] Bradykinn: Oh I see what you mean - this is nozdormu's future, not our nozdormu having turned offscreen. Sorry, been in and out during work meetings. That is possible and interesting yeah
[2:50:30] salvatorefortolino: Tali, we don't really know what time this cinematic is taking place
[2:50:32] Dagraine: Id say we could witness the seed of Nozdromu's corruption starting, little hints and differences in behavior first
[2:50:34] Kyferus: i think the better story is to just play this story in order, as in this is just him and we will see him become Murozond
[2:50:48] evilgnome42: Well with Time Travel - Noz and Murazond can both physically b e there at the same time.
[2:50:58] MikeyGy: @salvatorefortolino thats the point, he can travel in time
[2:51:05] salvatorefortolino: you sure?
[2:51:10] ishmael_euler: So you mean like this is Murozond but the Nozdormu we encounter in the actual Dragon Isles is still Nozdormu? My head hurts.
[2:51:11] s7wede: I think the Dracthyr are a genuine surprise for Nozdormu. There were no Dracthyr present during End Time. Not even 1 mention. Maybe with their help, the Infinite Dragonflight can be redeemed and be an ally instead of the big bad.
[2:51:22] salvatorefortolino: why can't it happen before that even?
[2:51:24] Harai_Ulfsark: yes we just saw emberthal waking up
[2:51:37] salvatorefortolino: ah
[2:51:37] TheRealReacher: Timey Whimey
[2:51:39] salvatorefortolino: :3
[2:51:39] codicier: Personally i think this cinematic all ends in the pointing spiderman meme with Murozond and Nozdormu :D
[2:51:39] Nolithan: Nolithan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Love this stream!
[2:51:40] shortstackrin: SPOILERS
[2:51:49] Spykadelic: Are Murazond and Noz different beings? Couldn't it just be Murazond pretending to be Nozdormu?
[2:51:51] salvatorefortolino: right, thank youu
[2:51:58] salvatorefortolino: dont have beta :(
[2:51:59] chill_xf: what if eyes open up in the doors and nzatho comes out like a bat out of hell
[2:52:07] Talieer: @Spykadelic Murozond *is* Nozdormu
[2:52:12] Nirial: Couldn't it also be just after the intro zone since Emberthal goes on her own?
[2:52:15] Kyferus: i just dont see the point, it feels like Mnight twist like in the village, like Okay..
[2:52:25] Dagraine: With them moving to light and titans potentially being bad, I could see Murozond being actually the "good guy" with the mentality of "ends justify the means"
[2:52:25] LGashly: OLD GODS
[2:52:32] EighthEndless: @Spykadelic same being at different points in time.  yes, the theory is that this could be murozond pretending to be nozdormu
[2:52:34] LGashly: OLD GODSSSS
[2:52:39] njerxs: do we know why the Dracthyr were confined? did i miss something obvious? on wowpedia it only says they were ordered there by Nelfarion and sealed by Malygos
[2:52:46] Babyspinat: D I N G !
[2:52:47] kuromebro: is anyone else having problems with wow not launching? my game just isn't launching at all somehow
[2:52:52] TikalValkyrie: old gods! <3
[2:52:58] EighthEndless: @njerxs not yet.  probably next week
[2:53:01] LGashly: tali there are no old gods in dragonflight
[2:53:09] salvatorefortolino: TRUST YOUR EYES!
[2:53:16] butlerlog: previous old god content had HUGE amounts of foreshadowing
[2:53:18] Yetik: Oohhh could it be a new torghast-type activity ? Pog
[2:53:27] LewsTherinTelefrag: aren't there nzoth tentacles out in the water somewhere?
[2:53:28] Harai_Ulfsark: i think a old god temple will come from that circle of water just near onahran plains
[2:53:29] Browl22: There are no old gods in ba sing se
[2:53:29] Abruhcadabro: There is no war in Ba Sing Se
[2:53:33] Angistar: there are no old gods in bai sing sei
[2:53:37] Browl22: xD
[2:53:39] xIncryptedx: maybe there is a new old god locked underground that is awakening along with the isles
[2:53:40] Nirial: I think there were also dragons there to be fair. I think the reason Metzen didn't like it is because we would fight all the other dragons in the raid and he said we wouldn't kill the good dragons unless they were corrupted for some reason
[2:53:42] Angistar: @Abrahcadabro LUL
[2:53:43] craftysloth: Noo @Yetik . No more Torghast homework! Lol
[2:53:47] EighthEndless: @Yetik oooo searching the procedurally generated caverns looking for the source of old god corruption lol
[2:53:47] njerxs: @njerxs oh okay, thanks :D
[2:54:02] xIncryptedx: "our earth. our strength."
[2:54:06] Spykadelic: @EighthEndless I meant that the Noz we meet in the Isles could also be Murazond. I don't see why they need to be different.
[2:54:12] Talieer: there are no old gods in ba sing se
[2:54:16] nulian: isn't the black empire reference to old gods in final part of quest
[2:54:22] craftysloth: Lol @Talieer
[2:54:23] Adrianocirilo: this place does not have titanish archtecture
[2:54:24] salvatorefortolino: the clouds for one
[2:54:24] Estralmage: YEP
[2:54:24] Gebruiksvoorwerp: Can Moruzand hide his form from the others, posing as Noz, or is the change too large to hide?
[2:54:27] AlpineHunterGSP: dude
[2:54:27] LGashly: DUN DUN DUUNNUUUUUUUU
[2:54:30] evilgnome42: All prisons have a door....
[2:54:34] shaxxtv: galakronds soul
[2:54:38] MikeyGy: it was very reminicent of nzothsprison
[2:54:45] Dagraine: Nzoth 2.0 Li-ion battery
[2:54:47] salvatorefortolino: the clouds for sure it controls
[2:54:48] Yetik: @craftysloth if they made it more like the visions in Bfa i wouldnt mind it ! Just to get mounts and transmogs !
[2:54:59] butlerlog: well we know the primalist dragons are imprisoned
[2:55:02] EighthEndless: @Spykadelic if that was the case future murozond would have to have killed present murozond?  or are you thinking nozdormu became corrupted some time during legion/bfa/SL?
[2:55:04] chlorophyllkid: alternate dwarfen race
[2:55:07] Bradykinn: These cinematics aren't the only old god references. The books form Uldaman
[2:55:07] Kyferus: the earth warden
[2:55:08] Spykadelic: @TaliesinAndEvitel Given that, why does stopping the flow cause the island to be hidden? More Old Gods stuff?
[2:55:10] Sombregard: 10.1, the return of Azerite grind
[2:55:11] Estralmage: The dragon Isles was the Titan's Main Foothold and Fortress against the Old gods
[2:55:11] Uthanman: Maybe Murozond is imprisoned beneath the Dragon isles o.O
[2:55:14] CuVulpi: Given the color of the gem, I assume it was some kind of gem that trapped the isles outside of time when broken
[2:55:15] craftysloth: If they had switched up the aesthetics of the different floors, it might have been a bit of a better experience for me, @Yetik !
[2:55:19] Saumur: But, Tali. You know: There are no Old Gods in Dragonflight! Cant you see it? None at all! Kappa
[2:55:27] skoojare: but if it was keeping something down there then why did nothing happen for 10 000 years while it was off?
[2:55:32] xIncryptedx: have we gotten a pre-expansion book yet?
[2:55:36] Wildflower_Ink: I think theis is after Raz is freed cause Emberthal goes off to wonder on her own and Noz shows up then.
[2:55:38] nulian: time travel quest to black empire
[2:55:47] salvatorefortolino: noone was there
[2:55:52] shaxxtv: i just hope blizzard start an anime serie !!!! for us who dont like reading :(
[2:55:57] Bradykinn: True. They are all "off the beaten path" lore so to speak, not part of the main story in game. There's more subtle references also, in some of the dragon conversations, but that's more the backhistory of the black dragonflight instead of a modern reference
[2:55:57] Spykadelic: @EighthEndless Yeah, kind of, or at least has begun to turn because we have been promised a reveal of the 'moment'
[2:55:59] skoojare: :(
[2:56:00] TacoWayno: Xalatath?
[2:56:02] Dagraine: Imagine Murozond being the twin of Nozdromu, not Nozdromu himself
[2:56:02] Nirial: Tali makin threats
[2:56:05] Outsane: D:
[2:56:05] Quachiri: 2 years and still no old golds in the game ;)
[2:56:07] shaxxtv: with Taliesin as story teller
[2:56:08] Wunani: So Nozdormu is a unique character because he already knows whats going to happen he would have already known Deathwing would become Deathwing
[2:56:11] GugsArch: Xal'atath back?
[2:56:13] Yetik: Wtf tali BibleThump
[2:56:16] ArkyteCurse: 10,000 years really isn't a long time to an immortal race
[2:56:16] xIncryptedx: @nulian actually getting to see the real black empire after the disappointing last bfa patch would be amazing
[2:56:22] LGashly: I mean if you think about it . . . every OTHER expansion has had some sort of big old god threat at the end . . ones that didn't are Vanilla, BC, Legion, and Shadowlands, the ones that DO are wrath, Cata, Mists, and BFA . . .soooo
[2:56:23] ishmael_euler: @TacoWayno Nah, she's not an Old God
[2:56:28] Gebruiksvoorwerp: please don't beat me up and throw me in a jail cell
[2:56:28] tjiani_: i wonder if there is actually something else locked away in the vault of the incarnates besides the other incarnates
[2:56:30] craftysloth: How do you feel about the concept of going underground in an expansion that's so focused on..well, flight? It's in the name of the expansion and all!
[2:56:31] LGashly: I think its more likely then not to be some sort of old god
[2:56:44] Saumur: Well, considering im a quite skinny guy, 10k years would be enough for me to fully recharge my strength Kappa
[2:56:44] EighthEndless: i always thought the shrouding mists sort of froze the dragon isles.
[2:56:48] MaMad666: @TaliesinAndEvitel Nozdurmu sounds devilish in the end
[2:56:48] Graffis101: what if the reason he can't see it is because it directly deals with the old god's, we know they deal in infinite possibilities
[2:56:59] SkylerQD: is it just me or do those doors in that room kinda remind anyone of yogg saron
[2:57:03] xIncryptedx: tentacley snot rockets
[2:57:05] casssstellini: She's like a void human, old gods are like void sneeze
[2:57:07] Talieer: so old gods are as much part of the void as the dragonflights are part of the arcane?
[2:57:08] EighthEndless: the void lords sneezed them out to infect our reality
[2:57:11] EighthEndless: theyre viruses
[2:57:13] tjiani_: voidlord boogers
[2:57:13] djadanis: i believe there is old god stuff in the isles that hasn't been found dead (i remember some dev tweeted in Shath'Yar and gloated about the secrets being well kept)
[2:57:17] Browl22: So the void dudes are like nice drinking companions?
[2:57:18] skoojare: void sneeze
[2:57:25] salvatorefortolino: @tjiani_ lol
[2:57:26] djadanis: found yet* not found dead
[2:57:26] JarJar_Brinkz: Old gods are partying as we speak since we banished Sargeras, they get free reign of all the other worlds
[2:57:27] Ryylar: Ryylar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[2:57:27] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL
[2:57:29] AlpineHunterGSP: weve all had bogies that look like old gods
[2:57:31] rumocrytuf: What's Knaifu been up to lately, anyway?
[2:57:31] majesty_2k1: bless you
[2:57:41] Graffis101: what if the reason he can't see it is because it directly deals with the old god's, we know they deal in infinite possibilities
[2:57:42] EighthEndless: old gods are very likely more powerful than most void creatures because they were specifically created to be powerful
[2:57:50] Spykadelic: Odyn just wanted Knifu land all for himself, that is why he lied to us about the Black Empire
[2:57:53] s7wede: The closest we have come to see something from the Void is Murmur in BC
[2:57:55] EighthEndless: nytharlotep!!!
[2:58:08] bladestitch: Do you think Anduin will show up at some point or sit this expansion out completely?
[2:58:13] LazyTitan7: a noble
[2:58:19] craftysloth: LOL on a gap year.
[2:58:21] Kyferus: old gods are like a bio weapon
[2:58:25] LGashly: but . .  xalatath was an old god that was killed by the other old gods wasn't she??????
[2:58:26] Caenogenesis: void spring break
[2:58:30] salvatorefortolino: lmao
[2:58:33] Lerosyl: And her dad is the Void Lord which shot the old gods onto azeroth.
[2:58:36] rohdey: Can we ship Xal and Anduin?
[2:58:37] ishmael_euler: Void Hipster Girl
[2:58:38] Caenogenesis: llike the kyrian do too after ascension
[2:58:38] EighthEndless: @bladestitch nah, hell be out completely.  he was the primary focus for 3 expacs in a row
[2:58:39] Saumur: Oh no, Xalatath is already dreaming in Old-God-Speech Kappa
[2:58:40] craftysloth: I want to be a rich girl on a gap year..
[2:58:44] MostGratuitous: ‚ÄúXal‚Äôatath is a much better representation of void society‚Äù      What, you mean sexy?
[2:58:50] Pinfeldorf: @LGashly My read on Xalatath is that she was a lieutenant or something of N'Zoth's
[2:58:55] Graffis101: how big is yogg?
[2:59:03] Lazzouli: Sounds like Juliette Mao from the Expanse series... But like, a super void entity
[2:59:05] EighthEndless: @Graffis101 roughly *this* big
[2:59:06] menzlo: gap megaannum
[2:59:10] JarJar_Brinkz: Kreygasm
[2:59:12] majesty_2k1: that's what she said
[2:59:13] Osirisson: "that's not big enough"
[2:59:20] Babyspinat: I want to solo raid this rich girl on a gap
[2:59:22] Pinfeldorf: As big as he needs to be.
[2:59:25] LGashly: is yog the only one still standing or is C'thun still alive aswell???
[2:59:27] Tiroxina: One of her lines even say that the OG's images we've seen are nothing like the actual bad Void shit
[2:59:28] zamyrha_: need more xalatath in wow, she's awesome
[2:59:31] Outsane: If someone has an interest in learning all about the lore, where should they start?
[2:59:34] Dagraine: meanwhile Xal'atath : I am my prison! (makes angry purple beams).
[2:59:35] evilgnome42: Bigger than the biggest thing ever, and THEN some...
[2:59:37] Saumur: And the Old GOds like parasites that delved through the entire crust of the planet? So Yogg should be as huge as the northern hemisphere, probably
[2:59:38] chlorophyllkid: If Xalatath was in the Dagger, is Remornia also a character in a weapon?
[2:59:39] EighthEndless: @LGashly its strongly suggested all old gods are dead.
[2:59:40] chill_xf: loki
[2:59:40] Talieer: are the old gods as much puppets as the dragon aspects presumably are to the titans?
[2:59:45] Trebled_Mind: I wonder if the void lords intended for the old gods to get as powerful as they did. The blood of Azeroth must have been more powerful than they predicted.
[2:59:49] BreninUK: Nobbell youtube
[2:59:59] jbmoongirl: She‚Äôs a Loki lol
[3:00:04] Tiroxina: she's like 'ask the ethereals cause they'll blow your mind'.
[3:00:05] tjiani_: why did xal even knew stuff about the future with the whispers and all
[3:00:08] BreninUK: yeah true
[3:00:11] LGashly: @LGashly thats just definitely not true though. Yog is so definitely not dead, and I dont think cthun is either but its not explicitly said either way
[3:00:14] EighthEndless: @LGashly there were theories that mortals couldnt kill old gods, but we almost certainly can kill them, so theyre probably all dead
[3:00:14] ishmael_euler: Chronicles is honestly worth it for the beautiful art alone imo
[3:00:19] GovernatorAO: what are your thoughts on the exploring azeroth books?
[3:00:20] JarJar_Brinkz: If you want to learn about lore, just avoid Moon guard, Lore doesn't exist there Kappa
[3:00:23] Abruhcadabro: *** and just fall down various rabbit holes
[3:00:28] Pinfeldorf: @tjiani_ Oh wait until you do a certain quest in Dragonflight that'll really fuck with you.
[3:00:32] rohdey: But isn‚Äôt Chronicle half truths/lies at this point?
[3:00:44] Tordrek_: and if you dont like reading the audio books are brilliant
[3:00:48] majesty_2k1: from a certain POV...
[3:00:52] Kyferus: and dosent help that 2 months later a vid about a character is compleatly diff
[3:00:57] The_Action_Man: History being written by the victors and all
[3:01:07] Saumur: Well, only because I tell you my POV that doesnt mean I am lying. Thats just meaning its my perspective
[3:01:09] ishmael_euler: Agreed, I showed nobbels summary to my fiance when she started playing and she was just overwhelmed. With chronicles you can just go at your own pace
[3:01:12] Spykadelic: Imo, it is like getting into comics, look into something you like, and when you have a question, look into that. You'll build a more natural understanding
[3:01:13] tjiani_: @pinfeldorf which zone? didn't do many sidequests on beta yet
[3:01:14] craftysloth: Are we talking about the Chronicle book series? I just searched it and that's what I'm seeing
[3:01:21] Tiroxina: DO WE, TALI? DO WE?
[3:01:22] Pinfeldorf: @tjiani_ Main quest, Thaldraszus
[3:01:23] bladestitch: What would be a wild card baddie that we haven't considered as "logical"?
[3:01:31] Kyferus: its titan propaganda
[3:01:34] xIncryptedx: odin has hidden the truth of dinosaurs from us for too long
[3:01:34] tjiani_: @pinfeldorf oh dang, ok thanks
[3:01:47] salvatorefortolino: out of context
[3:01:48] chlorophyllkid: THEY HAD FEATHERS!!!!
[3:01:48] shortstackrin: they call could have used magic for all we know
[3:01:57] majesty_2k1: Dinos, like birds, aren't real...
[3:02:01] bigoldmeatpie: t rex with feathers is wild
[3:02:02] SkyForged13: like how the appearance of dinosaurs have changed over time as we get more info
[3:02:03] Uthanman: Interpreted in a certain cultural framework ish
[3:02:05] grimetotem: Ember - Burning remnants. Thal - Of Earth. There's meaning behind it, I'm convinced.
[3:02:06] Dagraine: basically to get the final baseline on lore of wow we would need chronicles from PoV of all the cosmic forces
[3:02:09] Saumur: To be fair, the titants wouldnt say Chronicle is Titan propaganda either LUL
[3:02:23] Tiroxina: "And that's how I feel about dinosaurs" - this is what I'll take from today
[3:02:26] ourmanyfans: It's like when a book is in the third person but only follows one character's perspective
[3:02:26] LGashly: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you think all the old gods are dead right now???
[3:02:32] rohdey: I like the conspiracy theory that dinosaurs were actually remains of biblical giants
[3:02:40] salvatorefortolino: check out Tali's 3d cosmos vid
[3:02:42] Kyferus: titan bias
[3:03:12] EighthEndless: titan-leaning
[3:03:14] Lenitas: A lens of analysis
[3:03:21] shortstackrin: Odin would call them "tales"
[3:03:22] tjiani_: @grimetotem that kinda makes me think neltharion might be able to be reborn as a dracthyr
[3:03:24] Uthanman: Told in a language that doesn't have words for certain things yet
[3:03:32] HearthBits: titan friendly
[3:03:35] ishmael_euler: @spontaneoussouffle Yeah, because he's a dick!
[3:03:38] Kyferus: idk i feel like it might lie about the black empire
[3:03:41] woifee13: critical titan theory
[3:03:50] LazyTitan7: Titan's dairy
[3:03:58] Gebruiksvoorwerp: All i know about dinos comes from a documentary called Littlefoot
[3:04:12] rohdey: Wait, I thought they were filled with frog dna Kappa
[3:04:19] Xoyzor: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you ever feel that sometimes with your cinematic interpretations you bring to light things that their authors themselves never even taught about and it's just an overinterpretation?
[3:04:22] Kyferus: titan whitewashing LOL
[3:04:30] grimetotem: @tjiani_  I was leaning towards she may have the same corruption or be susceptible to it
[3:04:40] MaMad666: @TaliesinAndEvitel I really like to see the kids grow up e.g., Dagran Thaurissan II or Rhonin's twins Giramar & Galadin. Any clue if they are finally grownup?
[3:04:41] Osirisson: "history is written by the victors"
[3:04:42] EighthEndless: when they announced it they specifically said it was history from the titan's perspective
[3:04:43] Dagraine: Im just here waiting for Old Gods Chronicles where they all just sit around table upset that titans killed their bro Y'shaarj
[3:04:44] butlerlog: we know the titans did have an intent to deceive though, for their greater good
[3:05:05] ishmael_euler: Titan's "order" is like the lens we use to look at the chaos that is creation
[3:05:13] Sophrishea: just a matter of considering the source when looking at history
[3:05:21] AlpineHunterGSP: its psychoanalysis
[3:05:37] EighthEndless: @Dagraine nah, they would be like, yay! yshaarj is ded!  because he was so powerful the other old gods were, like, tucked into the corners of azeroth lol
[3:05:45] Sharktribe: As a person who works in animation and film- we think about all of this stuff, trust me.
[3:06:37] shortstackrin: maybe they watch the channel and go "that way better than what I was gonna do. Let's go with that, Stony Tony!"ü§ó
[3:06:43] Tiroxina: That's why there's straight up careers on how to tell stories through cinematic media, there's a lot of ways to convey a same thing.
[3:06:46] HavocHardt: Tali, to your point from before. What are your thoughts on the fact that Galakrond, and the proto aspects, of every proto dragon shown in Ch.1, only they are the ones shown with horns. All the rest of smooth.
[3:07:02] GovernatorAO: as a mixed media/fine artist there are plenty of interpretations of my work that totally make sense that I never thought about in the first place
[3:07:06] ourmanyfans: Animation is one of those mediums where because of the effort it takes to do anything, if you notice something it's probably intentional
[3:07:10] rws26: 2% of the time they did it to troll Bellular
[3:07:13] Trebled_Mind: They‚Äôre artists at heart so when you notice these things it makes them happy.
[3:07:25] Line_0: this is well explained
[3:07:31] valeor38: im still convinced the primus is the real jailer ngl
[3:07:31] idirai: idirai subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! wrong, we are all equals comrade
[3:07:39] grimetotem: @sharktribe as a writer and artist, I wholeheartedly agree
[3:08:09] majesty_2k1: do you have Evi watch them first?
[3:08:32] majesty_2k1: lol
[3:08:36] salvatorefortolino: it's a lovely stretch of the mind, these analyses
[3:08:47] bladestitch: I still think back to theories I had for other expansions and how different it ended up.^^
[3:08:51] EighthEndless: i will get this done :)
[3:08:51] Xoyzor: yeah I am a programmer so there no interpretation work in my field LuL
[3:09:02] LASpiritual: The cinematic analysis are my favorite of your videos! I always look forward to them.
[3:09:31] salvatorefortolino: yea but your videos made me more observant as well without realising
[3:09:33] SleepyPlant2: hey Tali, if deathwing created the dracthyr in secret, why do you think did he create dracthyr from all aspects? since you can create them in all 5 colours
[3:09:36] XanderDarks: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you think the 1st video will have that same "ticking" sound but slower? and the new vid after this will have the sound even faster and louder?
[3:09:51] Kyferus: i mean sometimes its subtle like a ticking clock or a music tone thats a reference to a character that the average person wont pick up
[3:10:14] majesty_2k1: @XanderDarks brilliant theory
[3:10:22] butlerlog: to make them stronk
[3:10:34] butlerlog: making dragons out of all aspects is what black dragons DO
[3:10:39] djadanis: oh wait, maybe death wing used the dragon soul to create the dracthyr
[3:10:41] djadanis: SMART
[3:10:50] bladestitch: Are the shots exactly the same?
[3:10:58] menzlo: we gonna get that power back
[3:11:04] XanderDarks: @XanderDarks it would be crazy to hear it as we get closer to the "present" it just gets to the point where it overtakes most of the music lol
[3:11:06] Dagraine: reverse the power suction into power propulsion back to the dragoons
[3:11:06] Durwen: LOL
[3:11:07] grimetotem: Emberthal knows they're weaker now if she wanted to rise up
[3:11:08] SkyForged13: moment ruined
[3:11:09] Bradykinn: Maybe the dragonsoul will be destroyed to release that power back out, to finish the empowering of the aspects. The aspects have the dragonsoul still right?
[3:11:09] ZerephTheFirst: Ah good ol Snap Camera
[3:11:11] Trebled_Mind: I wonder if Neltharion got the idea for the Dragon Soul from creating the Dracthyr.
[3:11:11] Xoyzor: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you think that Nozdormu is feeding us propaganda in those cinematics or are those just plain facts?
[3:11:16] Kyferus: and now theres a race that has all the powers in them...
[3:11:23] Line_0: good point
[3:11:29] djadanis: that sounds so obvious now that you mention it
[3:11:32] majesty_2k1: hmmmm
[3:11:33] AlpineHunterGSP: ...gee i wonder if it explains that in the starting zone...
[3:11:38] Chuelis: weren't the drakthyr created before the dragonsoul
[3:11:47] NinjAnola: yes
[3:11:51] Babyspinat: Maybe the Jailer helped him
[3:11:56] EighthEndless: ive been saying this all stream!  how come you didnt pick out my comments in a chat with 1000 ppl in it!!?!!
[3:12:04] Xoyzor: it must have been the first ones
[3:12:13] InfernoRain: Do you expect the next video next week, or maybe dropping with the release of dracthyr in prepatch?
[3:12:16] EighthEndless: @Xoyzor the xel naga
[3:12:17] kalecraft1: how many cinematics are they releasing?
[3:12:21] bettys_dungeon_adventures: that makes sense and if he did make them with the dragon stone he was already corrupted by then
[3:12:41] SkyForged13: The first chapter told the past, the second gave context to the present, and the third will likely tell what Nozy hopes for the future
[3:12:43] MachoCham: Murazond reveal feels more like an in-game cinematic during a patch
[3:13:05] Karthainn: Are the Dracthyr considered chromatic?
[3:13:09] Softex: did we look at the "new" login screen yet?
[3:13:19] Xoyzor: wow shifted from fantasy to scifi setting anyways
[3:13:23] LASpiritual: i was hype at the end of this one because i assumed the moment noz meant was when he learns info that turns him into murazond
[3:13:26] majesty_2k1: Ep 3, a new hope
[3:13:30] Dagraine: Out of the aspects we are still waiting for Alexstrasza to get some tragedy on the big screen, everyone else was corrupted or died (Ysera)
[3:13:38] xIncryptedx: promise, peril... and...
[3:13:40] Line_0: promise, peril, salvation?
[3:13:44] Line_0: who knows
[3:13:44] lokyr5: 2 p's i bet the next is a P word
[3:13:44] MachoCham: Promise > Perils > Potential?
[3:13:47] Tiroxina: Tiroxina subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Corrupted Taliesin: Niseilat
[3:13:53] SwimsDry: The third could be ‚ÄúThe Destiny of the Dragons‚Äù
[3:13:58] literally_human_garbage: @MachoCham i do like alliteration
[3:13:59] JoshMakesGames: no hands off the dragon queen, nothing bad for her
[3:14:04] Kyferus: i think it might have to do with whether dracthy are immune to titan or old god influence
[3:14:06] Uthanman: Potato
[3:14:06] salvatorefortolino: @LASpiritual same :)
[3:14:08] Durwen: pitfalls
[3:14:10] warwych_druchii: prophecy
[3:14:11] literally_human_garbage: progeny is good
[3:14:17] DozlaT: pasghetti
[3:14:18] Mistmay: Power
[3:14:21] MaMad666: Prophet?
[3:14:22] Thundryk: what if he has already turned, but just hasn't shown his true appearance
[3:14:24] SkyForged13: Do you think we'll have the ability to prevent Noz from becoming Murozond in some way?
[3:14:26] Xoyzor: spaghetti
[3:14:27] majesty_2k1: potato chips
[3:14:36] Dagraine: promise, peril, parliament
[3:14:39] JarJar_Brinkz: Of course not, its his long lost cousin
[3:14:39] Wunani: He has always been
[3:14:40] EighthEndless: nope
[3:14:43] EighthEndless: ill take that bet lol
[3:14:44] Wunani: Time is a Flat Circle
[3:14:44] Haskins14780: nope
[3:14:46] Trebled_Mind: I wonder if the creation of the Dracthyr creates doubt in Noz that the titans are the ultimate creators.
[3:14:56] menzlo: when does next chapter come out
[3:14:58] Bradykinn: I worry that however the moment that turns nozdormu into murozond ends up playing out is done, it can't meet audience expectation. It's hard to imagine what they can sell to the players to transform a nozdormu who is fully self aware into a murozond that he knows will be killed. Gets into weird timeloop stuff
[3:14:59] Xoyzor: promise, peril, paracetamol
[3:15:01] literally_human_garbage: promise, peril, parses
[3:15:05] bladestitch: Sounds fun.
[3:15:07] salvatorefortolino: thank you Tali it was great fun! :)
[3:15:07] LongConnSilver: omg
[3:15:07] MachoCham: I quite like off the cuff stuff to see the cogs turning as well
[3:15:19] majesty_2k1: promise, peril, pretzels
[3:15:19] The_Action_Man: Tali taught his brother how to play WoW, an dhe's a famous actor now!
[3:15:19] tommytheecommie: Not
[3:15:20] jimbowheat: Is that for the same thing Preach was helping the Togcast dudes?
[3:15:21] dergNwolf: never heard of
[3:15:29] bladestitch: On your stream?
[3:15:32] jimbowheat: *Yogcast
[3:15:36] Crazyyelir: Tali did you see the new community feasts coming in wow?
[3:15:38] kylinsky: I bet the dracthyr are the key to the aspects regaining their titan immortality powers.
[3:15:42] LongConnSilver: @jimbowheat they at least have played wow before lol
[3:15:49] Browl22: will we be able to get the wow twitch drops by watching you?
[3:16:07] MachoCham: Lets just say Dan has been dubbed WishPro
[3:16:09] MachoCham: KEKW
[3:16:19] idirai: @Browl22 it would be really weird if we couldn't
[3:16:20] majesty_2k1: flip flopper
[3:16:21] jimbowheat: I watched a bit of Preach earlier. His ilevel is 190 and the Yogscast dudes had better gear!
[3:16:22] MaMad666: KEKW
[3:16:23] salvatorefortolino: lol here we go again hahaha
[3:16:24] Anthy1887: LUL
[3:16:30] Line_0: got him
[3:16:32] JarJar_Brinkz: Call steve for the stream
[3:16:32] wizlordherbie: Preach never quit, he went on an extended vacay
[3:16:34] kalecraft1: Preach got kidnapped by Blizz
[3:16:39] woknarf: Why end the stream on a bad note, thanks
[3:16:50] SerMitten: I mean, you quit the game too, didn't you @TaliesinAndEvitel
[3:16:57] MaMad666: TheIlluminati TheIlluminati TheIlluminati TheIlluminati
[3:17:07] majesty_2k1: besh Channel right here
[3:17:11] NinjAnola: lol
[3:17:11] majesty_2k1: Best
[3:17:12] valeor38: tali getting paid by blizz? typical SHILL behavior /j KEKW
[3:17:16] Bluedreamss95: Bluedreamss95 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:17:18] jackphilipsen: He can never quite.
[3:17:25] Osirisson: I quit playing last night. But might pick it up again tonight after work.
[3:17:27] Harai_Ulfsark: i quit the game everyday and come back the next day
[3:17:30] Rolaz: i am paying blizz so they can create new addons, every month 15$
[3:17:31] Tiroxina: $hilling
[3:17:47] literally_human_garbage: i quit play at around midnight last night, but i imagine i'll come back after work
[3:17:58] LongConnSilver: they seem to be making a real effort at marketing and hyping up dragonflight which they didn't do last time
[3:18:04] MaMad666: Each expansion, I wish Dagran Thaurissan II grows up and gets a new model
[3:18:06] jimbowheat: They're paying Hurricane for stuff, which is great
[3:18:20] LASpiritual: Warcraft's TikToks have been really funny. Whoever is running that account needs a raise.
[3:18:24] Trebled_Mind: Speaking of wrath. Playing the DK starting zone again feels like coming home. Wrath was my first expac too.
[3:18:26] Osirisson: I will give Blizzard's social marketing game has stepped up A LOT for this expansion.
[3:19:00] adam3comp: YASSSS TALI I NEVER GOT A STREAM NOTIF
[3:19:01] Line_0: its good for the game
[3:19:03] adam3comp: how u doing bro
[3:19:06] Line_0: that you are involved
[3:19:10] nejore: good to have preach back
[3:19:26] jackphilipsen: They gave stony Tony some text. So they really rubbin on the content creaters.
[3:19:32] JarJar_Brinkz: The only downside to Preach playing WoW, is the FF starting wars in his chat monkaS
[3:19:40] Rugmanimus: Did you see the Guide/Newcomers chat being changed. Newcomers get booted after level 20. I feel like new players still have lots of questions after that stage of game play
[3:19:40] LASpiritual: That 100% would have happened
[3:19:40] Thoreya: he played wow for like 8 hours straight today lol. he was loving it
[3:19:44] nejore: well it
[3:19:45] Thoreya: hes already looking to raid the new raid
[3:19:48] Mistmay: preach is getting shit too but he did say he would come back if it changed
[3:19:49] bladestitch: Evil laugh.
[3:19:55] Kyferus: i mean he said he was taking a brake
[3:20:01] brybeanis: In all honesty he was back faster than that cause he did RWF casting
[3:20:04] kalecraft1: i wanted to try out FF again but i got screwed by the new authenticator lol
[3:20:05] MDSouleater: feenP A NEW ERA feenP
[3:20:15] scariewow: You right
[3:20:17] scariewow: =)
[3:20:20] LASpiritual: Are both you and Evi going to the castle?
[3:20:20] Kyferus: no i woulda agreed with you
[3:20:36] nejore: maybe not kyferus though
[3:20:38] Line_0: some people already said that LUL
[3:20:39] jackphilipsen: This sounds like a Drama time topic:P
[3:20:39] majesty_2k1: Square Enix account management is the worst
[3:20:39] Kyferus: WHy you calling me out bro lol i agree
[3:20:43] bladestitch: Food!
[3:20:44] lightweight1: dentists have molars
