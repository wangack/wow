[0:15:08] elysian1960: It was some UI addon
[0:16:01] undisputedmoe: Is it addon or you have to change something with the font folder ?

[0:17:33] elysian1960: I seem to recall adding fonts to the folder that came packaged with it
[0:17:35] ottavianimamax: Can someone help me figure an issue out.. my twitch is linked an I claimed the pet an mount but have not received either

[0:19:52] ottavianimamax: Yes I claimed both
[0:20:12] Sollice: No I said IN GAME
[0:20:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: hint its not the mailbox
[0:20:45] Sollice: You have to go to the mounts page and you will see a gift wrap package for the camel, and pets tab for the pet
[0:21:12] ottavianimamax: Yea I've done that an still not showing
[0:21:43] Molvonos: Question 1:  Does Twitch show that both are flagged as 'Claimed' in the Drops window?
[0:22:06] 91Niki: Might just be delayed honestly
[0:22:21] Molvonos: Might be.  The pet shouldn't be at this point, but plausible
[0:22:31] ottavianimamax: Yes
[0:22:58] 91Niki: Seems like if you start watching from the second it goes live, it shows up right away. People later on have to wait 24-48 hours before it shows up
[0:22:59] ottavianimamax: I wish I could screenshot an share but u can't on here
[0:23:11] 91Niki: Oh it's the pet not showing up
[0:23:17] Molvonos: Its both, Niki
[0:23:19] Molvonos: Pet and mount.
[0:23:21] neverbornlucky: The actor who plays Mando in star wars has been announced as reed richard in fantastic 4 of Marvel MCU remake they are doing
[0:23:23] Molvonos: Pet should be there.
[0:23:36] 91Niki: yeah it should be, but then again the feldrake took forever for some people to show up
[0:23:42] Sollice: All Hail Daddy Pascal
[0:23:44] ottavianimamax: I've not gotten either
[0:23:51] GILLBERTSON: 30 minute intro 👀👀

[0:24:24] Sollice: @Lulaboo I agree

[0:24:33] MoodyVanessa: @lulaboo i agree with that
[0:24:34] 91Niki: I still don't trust anything
[0:24:51] 91Niki: They have talked about so many different actors at this point
[0:25:01] 91Niki: I'll wait until Marvel makes it official before I trust anything
[0:25:36] Sollice: What is the world coming to. It's like 10 bucks for a dozen original cripsy creme?
[0:25:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: John Krasinski or riot

[0:35:21] Sagevaulk: the manhole issue
[0:35:23] drunkieduckie: Morning everyone!
[0:35:31] MoodyVanessa: 2 of those are hearthstone promotion, the hearthsteed and the disk
[0:35:34] Sagevaulk: yeah.  been really bad.
[0:35:35] neftario105: vape fill your lungs with liquid
[0:35:42] firehawk73: its was a shitshow when i was there 2 weeks ago...couldnt even see the fountains at the Belagio
[0:35:47] robby136: They did the second practice, but then kicked everyone out the grandstands for some reason
[0:35:50] tr4ncetv: they kicked out fans in the stands at 130am because the "track was closed"
[0:35:54] PotbellyGoat: they ran the other practice at 0530ET this morning lol. It meant the roads had to be closed longer, plus no fans
[0:35:54] alphabot357: Question is, is this a bad look on F1 or Vagas
[0:36:01] Teldrin89: ... I mean it's practice today, right?
[0:36:14] Sollice: @alphabot357 Both

[0:36:43] jeffnsteff2019: morning sir toweliee
[0:36:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: @91Niki car drove over manhole and the lid shot into their car breaking it
[0:37:17] 91Niki: @HaxzorJimDuggan Wait... in F1 race?!
[0:37:23] firehawk73: Uber driver was telling me ....complete shitshow there
[0:37:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah a f1 car
[0:37:34] Sagevaulk: it was one of the practice races
[0:37:44] jeffnsteff2019: how u guys feel about dreymond greeen being suspended 5 games for his choke hold other night
[0:37:45] 91Niki: @HaxzorJimDuggan Like an actual race or just a F1 car driving on official roads?
[0:37:48] Vampiria_for_the_Horde: :)
[0:38:02] MoodyVanessa: they will for sure have to remove Las Vegas from F1, its not going to work out like this
[0:38:08] Sagevaulk: it was Sainz car
[0:38:09] firehawk73: @91Niki real race , like Monaco
[0:38:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: @91Niki i believe it was during the first race yeah
[0:38:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: race was cancelled after that
[0:38:24] PotbellyGoat: did any testing of the Dragonflight follower dungeons happen yet?
[0:38:27] 91Niki: WTF is a pot hole DOING ON A F1 RACE TRACK?!?!?!?!
[0:38:27] doogs44: I think they are going to get stuck on smolderon
[0:38:54] Sagevaulk: so now that Ferrari will need work.  car only cost $15 million.
[0:38:57] MoodyVanessa: @haxzorjimduggan it was a practice the actual race is tomorrow night
[0:39:02] robby136: The F1 track is on the streets, the manhole cover was on the strip
[0:39:08] nostreamerstream: Blizz hadW's since 9.1.5
[0:39:10] iamelcapitan: They wont get through last few fights before reset... but i do think it doesnt make it to next weekend
[0:39:16] neverbornlucky: Towelliee so you think the mando actor will finally break the fantastic four curse of horrible movies ?
[0:39:19] MoodyVanessa: @91niki street circuit
[0:39:21] jkitchin75: @91Niki cos the track is the normal road
[0:39:24] Sollice: @91Niki I mean they converted regular roads
[0:39:27] gho5tfinger: do you think they ever ban splits just for LULZ
[0:39:47] 91Niki: Right?! But the amount of inspections you gotta do before a F1 race. Someone fucked up BAD

[0:40:17] Sagevaulk: @91Niki yeah.  someone really messed up.
[0:40:38] TweektheProphet: i think the only way to make RFW exciting again is to split out the mythic phase from the normal heroic, but then you are just doing something for the 1%
[0:40:49] robby136: Modern day F1 cars are ground effect, they basically suck themselves to the floor to gain downforce, the car literally sucked the manhole cover up
[0:41:01] 91Niki: @robby136 Yep
[0:41:25] 91Niki: Is the driver ok?
[0:42:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah he if you watch his pov he barely noticed, car just told him to stop

[0:44:11] mmrghost7: its realy a bad idea to deny everyone the lego axe untill someone gets it first in mythic ,

[0:44:27] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[0:44:55] mmrghost7: becuz not everyone is mythic player , many ppl do hc and normal
[0:45:14] Molvonos: And they have to wait until mythic clears it before it becomes available.  I don't see the issue.
[0:45:39] Molvonos: This coming from a decidedly not-mythic raider Evoker who had to 'wait' last season too.
[0:46:05] mmrghost7: the issue is i dont get my lego axe bcuz of some 0.1% player have not got their lego axe first
[0:46:15] Molvonos: Oh noes.
[0:46:29] Molvonos: That's if RNG likes you enough to even give it to you.
[0:46:33] yshtola1337: instant dollars might become the new champion they 6/9 now

[0:52:12] Lulaboo: @Molvonos Doubtful but on the chance they do they would make guilds consider how much time to spend in splits

[0:52:57] dyoda2015: dyoda2Hi dyoda2Love
[0:53:02] Lulaboo: @neftario105 Usually if the RWF is a marathon, Echo does well, if its a Sprint, Liquid does well. The method rebuild is still in progress but are still contenders
[0:53:03] Nerendis: Morning Towel
[0:53:16] Molvonos: @Lulaboo Yep, that's what i'm hoping.  People're bitching about Mythic tuning, but you've got Top 1%ers spending so much time in Splits when they could, you know, just run the raid.
[0:53:36] 91Niki: @Towelliee did you see all the new mounts in the next patch? :D https://www.wowhead.com/news/first-look-at-patch-10-2-5-mounts-fur-endship-fox-peafowl-hearthstone-336200
[0:53:39] neverbornlucky: Towelliee can the main actor of Mando finally break the Fantastic four curse of bad movies as the new Reed Richards

[0:55:59] 91Niki: @neftario105 Is that 100% official from Marvel or more rumors?
[0:56:07] Skizzurp: how did shade 1st raid night go?
[0:56:13] phisig: They freak out when they see some random 6/9
[0:56:22] neftario105: and a Spanish actor who is Husband to Penelope cruz will play Galactus
[0:56:27] Lulaboo: it was supposed to be 100
[0:56:29] Lulaboo: hold on
[0:56:44] Lulaboo: opp wrong chat
[0:56:51] Nerendis: I guess it's a good sign that there are so many people unfamiliar with how the race works? Like that means new people are watching? Even if it's funny how worried people are about Liquid not being 6/9 lol
[0:56:53] neftario105: @91Niki and a Spanish actor who is Husband to Penelope cruz will play Galactus
[0:57:08] neverbornlucky: Towelliees  favorite Helmt dude is going to be a fantastic Four
[0:57:11] 91Niki: @neftario105 Again I am asking did Marvel officially announce that or is it rumors?
[0:57:15] neftario105: @91Niki was on Twitter
[0:57:25] 91Niki: @neftario105 Was it from marvel officially? LUL
[0:57:29] 91Niki: My god it's a simple question
[0:57:41] thekl0wn2: no its a rumor
[0:57:44] Aflictionn: whats the sword mog u got on

[3:41:59] Clay2K_: @91Niki nah it's Blizz's fault. it gives you the item stil lbut just unlocks it immediately in barbershop so keep the item banked in case
[3:42:18] 91Niki: @Clay2K_ Yeah but it's still an exploit
[3:42:21] 91Niki: That is not how that works
[3:42:25] Clay2K_: either way, it's not to hard to get the 20 fish to do it correctly

[4:09:17] stratiss: it makes so much money, they wont stop raiding
[4:09:27] Screamnsteam: but EU has been winning for so long until recently, so why is it now an issue lol
[4:09:32] Armdel: im sure a lot of echo raiders are just ready to quit regardless, some of them have been at it for a decade
[4:09:37] 91Niki: But, what about all the raid tiers where EU won? cohhHmm
[4:09:42] 91Niki: What was the difference then?
[4:09:55] mooseon: general question, how is the re-entry to dragonflight, last patch i tried coming back but got overwhelmed with the million different quests that were being offered, and the renown grind doesnt sound fun
[4:09:57] Dcarter: There’s isn’t it’s a problem now bc they’ve lost some due to this
[4:10:06] Maydie6066: @91Niki Skill if we win, blizzards fuck up if we lose Kappa

[4:22:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Evoker's rescue is also good for fast movement
[4:22:21] Molvonos: Rescue's dangerous because it puts damage on the Evoker.

[4:23:58] Sollice: @CaptainSantors Not really winning when the other top guilds aren't trying yet

[4:50:00] Molvonos: They've been steadily nerfing them to try and bring them in line with other dps, problem is, like Paxinoro said, if one other dps dies, then you're kinda fucked.
[4:50:13] S1appadabass: they dont contribute much outside of Ebon might windows

[4:51:01] neftario105: @Molvonos so is not a dps is something else like Bard in FFXIV?
[4:51:03] Molvonos: If you're talking raw damage, yea.  But you can keep Ebon Might up almost constantly.
[4:51:07] Molvonos: @neftario105 Yep
[4:51:07] S1appadabass: @Molvonos oh snap, i forgot about pres

[4:52:03] Molvonos: And most Aug's are running Sansok pants, so that's even more Verse into the group.  Basically, we want to gear to help our group as much as possible, even if it shafts our dps.
[4:52:21] Molvonos: I was giving out like, 1800 primary stat last night in our heroic raid.

[5:24:44] the_general01: wasnt the last time it was really good legion?
[5:25:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ret is still a good spec, they had their nice rework and did get tuned down, but it's still very good
[5:25:07] 91Niki: WW burst aoe is great, burst single target is doing pretty well as well. Sustaining dps however is just junk
[5:25:09] awakenedshadow92: I never got dungeon running myself
[5:25:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ret with that legendary 2H axe is going to be wicked

[6:00:24] jerseyfive: blizzard should buff those bosses now LUL
[6:00:43] Syntrosis: Just curious because it's been something I think about constantly, would Blizzard ever set Time limitations or some sort of scheduling for WF race? Limiting game time and splits
[6:00:53] Robodope: wouldn't they want it to end before thanksgiving weekend? feels like sunday kill would be best for viewership
[6:01:00] Robodope: like this sunday
[6:01:28] Robodope: yea I know, I just mean like buffing the boss would do the opposite is what I mean

[6:01:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Limiting attempts would be rude, yeah
[6:02:01] Syntrosis: @Towelliee That makes a lot more sense, I've always thought of it as problematic, just something I've had stuck in my brain the past few years lol
[6:02:14] Sollice: I have all of next week off :P
[6:02:22] Robodope: imagine if they hit fyrakk on thanksgiving and then the boss is bugged
[6:03:40] Aidler: that the race always getting limited by some holidays is odd
