[1:36:40] dylondium: Tip: Your first Dracthyr can be on any realm. Subsequent Dracthyr must be on a realm where you already have a level 50. So it might be good to roll on a new server for your first.
[1:36:42] galaxy11plays: @stellular2 very easy because i setup my UI to look exactly like the buttons on the side so the ability on screen coresponds to the button i push
[1:36:45] unknownbudz: @Tordrek_ correct and i think thats why they gave them so much mana is cus most of thier heals is 25yd range meaning they are basically pocket healers and open to alot of CC and hard switches. but the problem is they have a ton of mobility/mana/immunities thats its not even and issue if they get hard switched ur best way to win is cc evoker for kill.
