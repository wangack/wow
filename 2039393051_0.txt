[0:44:41] ama__deus: @Ziqoftw I need your big brain. BURNOUT RUNE: it says non-periodic CRITICAL STRIKES cost 1% more base mana, but how does that work? If you only got enough mana for a non-crit, how would the game know? Does it reduce your mana retroactively if you crit? Confused
[0:44:49] JonaDefty: die in stv and act surprised for the youtube vid
[0:44:56] StaXxGaming: why did they stop raiding after 2 MCs?  @Ziqoftw

[3:53:20] Wryz: Do you think they could actually  use Wotlk talent trees in SOD (up to 31 points in each tree like in classic to get last node), imo they would suit quite well they're more refined

[3:58:20] Wryz: @blizzardpolice69 yeah probably the community wouldn't like it, but I'm pretty sure we'll get some of the wotlk talents as runes in the future of SOD, for warriors for example I'm pretty sure they'll have taste for blood and sudden death procs or maybe even titan's grip
