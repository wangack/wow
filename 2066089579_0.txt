[1:04:13] Anhak: and by fast i mean actually one shotty
[1:07:23] c0jaK: my m+ friends just aren't playing right now
[1:07:49] c0jaK: it's fine i hit my gear goals so it's whatever
[1:08:25] squikie: PVE always follow the same cycle. Lots of activity at the start, then it dies out, then a patch hit and it kicks back in. Retail pve is dead cus most people got keystone conq already and full gear so peeps be taking breaks / doing other stuff until the .5 pach hits
[1:08:30] squikie: patch'
[1:08:45] c0jaK: yeah i don't think that's a problem
[1:08:50] c0jaK: i'm fine with the cycle
[1:09:19] Anhak: the thing is .5 isnt coming soon cause its suppose to be a new season also a lot of m+ers are not big on it
[1:09:47] squikie: I mean for PVE I just log in every wednesday, do Fyrakk LFR and HC to see if I get the legendary, then spend the rest of the week doing pvp or farming some transmog or something. Not much else happening in PVE atm
[1:10:21] squikie: Oooo Challenge mode / Set Gear pieces stuff would be super fun
[1:10:55] Anhak: heavily speculated that the next m+ season will have some sort of CM wheather the system is more cm or etc unclear
[1:10:57] c0jaK: wasn't there a thing in mop that you had to do to go into the raid?
[1:11:00] squikie: I had a lot of fun with Challenge Mode in MoP when it came out
[1:11:47] Hani_Senpai: I guess I’ll play sod if it’s popping that fast
[1:14:24] squikie: @c0jaK MoP had the legendary cloak quest chain which required both PVP and raids if that what you're thinking about?
[1:14:51] c0jaK: wasn't there some solo thing that you had to do for something
[1:14:54] c0jaK: maybe it was for like LFG
[1:15:22] c0jaK: but it had like bronze/silver/gold thing
[1:15:46] squikie: Other then the legendary cloak Q I cant remember anything else at least
[1:15:57] Izzythediscpriest: @c0jaK the proving grounds?
[1:16:08] c0jaK: thats what it was

[1:17:32] Izzythediscpriest: venruki made a great vid about it
[1:18:21] Anhak: thats like saying u need to play 10 random bgs to queue arena
[1:18:58] Anhak: this was wod tho right after the simplifications
[1:19:11] c0jaK: or leveling needs to actually be longer
[1:19:19] c0jaK: you don't actually spend time with your class anymore
[1:19:24] Izzythediscpriest: i'm old, slow and dumb. the simpler the better for me lol

[2:17:23] kirk_hunts: Why are we giving this dude more attention
[2:17:42] kirk_hunts: ignore him is the worst thing we could do to him
[2:17:50] americanmoses18: perma these nutz
[2:18:23] kirk_hunts: he should be permad and IP banned
[2:18:44] Anhak: 12 ppl that raid 30 some in no offcial like legit this is very hard griefing
[2:19:25] dawsonator171: I'm waiting for the anhak BFD carry.
[2:20:19] artsskeit: @kirk_hunts wont more attention (and the communitys reaction) make it more likely for blizzard to see it and ban him
[2:21:14] kirk_hunts: I'm just tired of the dude
[2:21:18] kirk_hunts: Blizzard knows
[2:22:07] kirk_hunts: yeah that was the addon
[2:22:11] blowoutsale: @notmes  is it confirmed he did it on purpose?
[2:22:19] kirk_hunts: this was against actual tos
[2:23:05] tooch2: how did they let him back in the guild?
[2:23:35] kirk_hunts: However he does his fake c onfusion bs which if you stirip away all of the things we know and look at it like a judge would look at a case he would probably get off scot t free and just stick with his bull shit wrong corner thing.
[2:23:45] tooch2: that's some devious shit
[2:23:55] kirk_hunts: a good lawyer would win that case
[2:24:24] morgraz: anyone got a clip
[2:24:26] tooch2: he's got priors lol
[2:24:30] dawsonator171: Wait, what happened? I'm lost.
[2:24:33] morgraz: i just got here
[2:25:24] kirk_hunts: That's what good lawyers do is they make everything other than what they want to be seeninadmissible.
[2:25:30] dawsonator171: Sounds like the man has some issues of the endowment variety.
[2:25:30] kirk_hunts: but regardless
[2:25:38] kirk_hunts: he's jsut a pos lol
[2:25:40] Anhak: a lawyer protects you from the goverment not a company
[2:25:50] dawsonator171: it's not only his violin that is tiny.
[2:26:00] Anhak: ur never winning getting banned from a company
[2:26:11] kirk_hunts: every stream I've been in he's dropped a sub in to get attention
[2:26:14] kirk_hunts: al lday today
[2:26:41] eMBeaR64oz: I just got here, what’s happening lol
[2:26:48] kirk_hunts: it's horrible
[2:26:54] Anhak: i mean 7 days played atleast
[2:27:01] Anhak: likely 20 40 days
[2:27:08] kirk_hunts: I would be completely fine with blizzard restoring that
[2:27:12] kirk_hunts: and undoing his bs
[2:27:53] eMBeaR64oz: I assume someone friended a raid of hardcore wow players or something ?
[2:28:05] eMBeaR64oz: griefed *
[2:28:13] dawsonator171: should definitely run double outlaw. for reasons relative to AWC and success.
[2:28:24] kirk_hunts: Yeah this dude who's name will never be important
[2:28:43] kirk_hunts: like to grief hardcore raiders on final bosses
[2:29:02] kirk_hunts: Or like some of the biggest bosses in the game
[2:29:32] kirk_hunts: The problem is the guy is actually very good and he can just buy an account and show up as a wolf in sheeps clothing and then kill 12 of your raiders
[2:29:42] tooch2: stop bulling my poor ele shamans lol
[2:31:18] kirk_hunts: But yeah I looted 2 agm chests this morning with PB

[3:09:21] MaybeRespect: @Devcomz It usually takes me a whole season to find people then they quit game

[3:43:34] felstorms: @sandorvargas No, DH ms is 25. It's nerfed by half in pvp
[3:44:44] felstorms: I think wound poison stacks to 24% so it's basically the same
[3:45:12] krome2dadome: but wound poison will always be removed by blade dance ms
[3:45:19] krome2dadome: it's like legit bad to play i think
[3:45:35] sandorvargas: wound poison is 48% just checked
[3:46:00] FateIRL: im pretty sure smaller ms doesnt override bigger ones
[3:46:01] sandorvargas: if us nerfed in pvp should be 24% :P

[6:34:17] Axtin: wounds heal seemed really powerful in some cases before
[6:35:43] xiliketurtlex: do you think we will have another tuning this season? or are we just stuck until season 4?
[6:35:54] Axtin: yea seems best into high hps healers
[6:36:10] Yoskexz: prob feral nerfs
[6:36:38] Axtin: need feral nerfs asap
[6:37:21] atoker: 2 charges of survival instincts
[6:37:23] atoker: yeah?
[6:37:39] Yoskexz: wall lasts for 15 sec so they can press it in the opener like rogues do with evasion
[6:37:51] Axtin: i dont even think feral is that squishy, is the casting cyclones that makes feral seem sqiushy
[6:38:02] Axtin: it's*
[6:38:07] Yoskexz: u need the manther back
[6:38:30] Axtin: being out of form and standing still basically
[6:38:40] fahrell29: is there any feral rework planned ?
[6:39:04] Axtin: when you are playing in cat form and constantly being evasive against melee you can live pretty well
[6:39:12] krome2dadome: ^
[6:39:14] thinkablelol: having to swap out of cat form to live while having ur bleeds drop is insane, every dps class has gap closers which we cant outrun anymore.
[6:39:17] Axtin: soon as you stop what youre doing to cast cyclones thats when you take the most damage
[6:39:31] thinkablelol: also casting clone in normal form is redic when ur getting trained
[6:39:48] popzirl: i think they're squishy in cat too but im DH
[6:39:48] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[6:39:57] krome2dadome: there’s an annoying feral/arcane/pally team that just runs away the entire game
[6:40:05] atoker: if you sac healing you can get boomkin form without starsurge to cast clones
[6:40:15] Axtin: i think survival instincts should have a longer duration or make it 2 min cd
[6:40:46] popzirl: that makes sense yeah something to suriv instinct
[6:41:53] Axtin: you already get insta regrowths from finishers
[6:42:05] xiliketurtlex: sounds like feral need claws of shirvallah back
[6:42:22] thinkablelol: but then we have no cc whatsoever, bash is too long of  cd
[6:42:28] Axtin: im not a fan of that i think feral frenzy should just be unnerfed and go back to being only accessible by pressing the actual button
[6:42:34] redskinlgnd: In mop the instant regrowth you could use on a clone or root as well
[6:42:59] popzirl: instant clone might be too op tho w current meta
[6:43:05] Axtin: blizz already decided they dont want predatory swiftness to be a part of our damage when they redesigned bloodtalons
[6:43:41] Axtin: 10% i believe
[6:43:47] redskinlgnd: I didn't like there not being an outplay to the instant clones but meh not sure if they need it or not
[6:44:04] Axtin: nah insta clones is a bad idea
[6:44:06] Axtin: imo
[6:44:21] drfeltgood: !discord
[6:44:21] Moobot: @drfeltgood Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[6:44:26] Axtin: they need to just get rid of "fast clones" like with heart of the wild
[6:44:31] Axtin: its toxic
[6:44:49] Axtin: and remove the wild attunement honor talent
[6:45:06] iLLwiLL_HS: mop was super toxic with the instant cc but it was still my favorite pvp expac
[6:45:31] redskinlgnd: I did prefer mops cc compared to the bazillion micro ccs for sure
[6:46:07] redskinlgnd: but that could be rose tinted glasses
[6:46:11] popzirl: then it would just be rmd all over again all day

[6:46:59] iLLwiLL_HS: god comp and lsd were the strongest comps in s15
[6:47:05] Axtin: ideally what i want for feral is remove the cyclone pvp talent, make cyclone baseline and buff feral frenzy/adaptive swarm. the druid talent tree makes it really punishing to get cyclone
[6:47:14] JockeTB: can you show talents? @notmes
[6:47:18] thinkablelol: @Axtin what u play more dot build or big bite?
[6:47:29] redskinlgnd: yeah s14 was godcomp and wps

[7:01:43] hackit_: this damage is ridiculous
[7:02:01] saren8: You were the chosen one [Mes]. It was said you would destroy the DHs not join them! Bring balance to the classes not leave it in darkness
[7:02:03] Axtin: @thinkablelol 💀💀💀💀
[7:02:12] avenueone: mes is destroying dh
[7:02:14] avenueone: by playing it
[7:02:18] saren8: Quoting starwars
[7:02:39] TheEyeVII: @saren8 oh darkness, I get it
[7:02:45] popzirl: i watched that today w my son lol
[7:03:17] Shablagoosh: nah flightstones suck its always terrible
[7:03:20] TheEyeVII: @avenueone idk, pretty sure blizz saw his team dominate everything as not DH so.. might wanna rethink the strategy there
[7:03:41] avenueone: mes got the pre emptive nerf on dk :)) dh inc
[7:03:55] Axtin: isnt there a 1 time quest in emerald dream for 50 or something
[7:04:08] Axtin: i forget
[7:04:13] saren8: @TheEyeVII But the majority of players aren't playing 3k rating 3s, they're playing solo shuffle getting stomped by the same spec every lobby
[7:04:19] TheEyeVII: didn't dh got nerfed like 10 times after their rework
[7:04:20] avenueone: all that crap in emerald dream gives a fair bit of flightstones
[7:04:21] avellan94: used to farm rise hc for flightstones.. was very fast dunno if it got nerfed tho
[7:04:38] TheEyeVII: get nerfed* rather
[7:04:38] popzirl: dh hasnt gotten touched in a while
[7:04:47] avenueone: in s1 df? ye
[7:04:53] avenueone: they were baby nerfs each time though
[7:05:09] TheEyeVII: the rework was this season bud
[7:05:41] saren8: uh the rework was start of DF
[7:05:53] popzirl: the chaos dmg? not rly a rework
[7:05:57] TheEyeVII: noway, lemme check
[7:06:13] Axtin: it was this season lol
[7:06:18] Axtin: pretty sure
[7:06:27] TheEyeVII: the dh rework was in 10.2 you liars
[7:06:44] popzirl: it wasnt a nerf tho
[7:06:46] TheEyeVII: and they did get heavily nerfed after that, but the remains of that is still shown on ladder, i'm guessing
[7:06:46] popzirl: at all
[7:07:18] TheEyeVII: you want me to post the blues? cuz you're mistaken it was huge nerfs
[7:07:29] TheEyeVII: bigger than dk got
[7:08:08] saren8: def not enough, they could use another 20% across the board
[7:08:12] Axtin: ya they got big nerfs cause they were nearly ret rework levels of op, and theyre still s tier after all the nerfs
[7:08:58] saren8: They're only #1 in solo shuffle, #2 in 2s and #2 in 3s
[7:09:15] TheEyeVII: you can kill the class at this point, who cares, although the dmg is already done the ladder is filled with them & it's not changing until next season
[7:09:36] avenueone: what tier set did dhs get for next season
[7:09:52] TheEyeVII: uh i can check, i think it's same as this current one
[7:10:00] TheEyeVII: ya it is
[7:10:47] avenueone: well im not gonna be able to do anything
[7:10:54] avenueone: iv got dinner very shortly so maybe in 30 ish
[7:11:04] Axtin: you got the green thingy
[7:11:07] Axtin: which has them
[7:11:08] popzirl: the whispering things give a few
[7:11:10] saren8: I dont mind the current ladder if they just nerf it into the ground
[7:11:32] snickersxdd: what do u need flightstones for
[7:11:54] Axtin: to create sparks for crafting gear
[7:11:58] avenueone: each spark costs like 250 each
[7:12:08] TheEyeVII: the only thing making dh viable is essence break, no need to nerf overall dmg, just nerf that one ability and it has zero real burst
[7:12:17] Axtin: idk why they made it so you need flightstones to make sparks this season, such a random change that nobody wanted
[7:12:19] xiliketurtlex: just do some world quest
[7:12:33] xiliketurtlex: think they give you fstones
[7:12:34] TheEyeVII: at least not as insane
[7:13:14] Axtin: you already opened it
[7:13:14] basedgodgerald: mes if you follow that questline you just took for SHandris, go to Emerald Dream area and there's 1 where if you upgrade a piece of gear (do cape) it'll give you 100 flights
[7:13:17] Axtin: it was the faint whispers
[7:13:38] popzirl: yeah that was wierd
[7:13:42] saren8: Why would making them be inline with other classes fair
[7:13:47] popzirl: usually gives me flightsones
[7:13:55] xiliketurtlex: might have to do that quest maybe?
[7:14:07] xiliketurtlex: flighstone upgrade quest?
[7:14:19] popzirl: prob need to do some emerald dream stuff yeah
[7:14:35] avenueone: if any chars got full sockets i think u can buy em there unsure if boa
[7:14:43] TheEyeVII: is it an established strat btw for streamers to play the class/comp they want nerfed & then post it @blizz for next cup, for an easier win
[7:15:00] TheEyeVII: noway right Kappa
[7:15:36] saren8: DK just needs to be balanced to be along side frost DK
[7:15:39] saren8: in terms of strength
[7:16:01] TheEyeVII: that'd just kill frost, how does that make sense
[7:16:31] StreamElements: Get 50% off your first Factor75 box + Free Wellness Shots for Life using my link! Two free wellness shots per order with an active subscription https://strms.net/factor75_notmes #ad
[7:17:30] saren8: Huh?
[7:17:42] saren8: I'm saying bring them to the same level, so bring where havoc is down to where frost is
[7:17:59] TheEyeVII: one thing i do want nerfed is rogue "kit" just too much defensives & cc, put higher cds on everything & make clone dispellable/or breakable by any dmg
[7:18:32] saren8: And then just like frost DK leave it in the gutter for a few seasons
[7:18:39] aod0311x: isnt it sad that you have to wait for dampening to get high enough for someone to die
[7:18:56] thrakzr: What makes you want to have multiple DH's?
[7:19:35] popzirl: lol
[7:19:48] TheEyeVII: @aod0311x well if you wanna be a 1 button clicker, you can play an fps & 1 shot an entire team by aiming at their pixel heads but that's just a gaming preference I suppose

[7:22:44] avenueone: ok
[7:23:19] thrakzr: What is that 3rd item from the left that you put in when crafting?
[7:23:47] yarth85: Hi mes
[7:24:00] saren8: @thrakzr the mettle or the missive?
[7:24:09] sunileif: how do you get things crafted ona a podunk server?
[7:24:14] TheEyeVII: it's so weird that resto druid has most 2.4+ characters 9.42% and it's a healer, insane to me 2nd on the list is dh 3rd is rsham 4th is lock 5th is hpal, wtf
[7:24:24] popzirl: 3rd from left was missive i believe
[7:24:32] thrakzr: not the missive and not the item that makes it 489 in pvp. It's blue
[7:24:45] saren8: blue silken lining
[7:24:47] thrakzr: Wasnt the missive @saren8
[7:24:53] thrakzr: yeah!
[7:24:55] saren8: gives you mastery above 90% health
[7:24:58] popzirl: oh zone
[7:25:14] saren8: 3rd from the left is weird, because like from left to right its
[7:25:15] thrakzr: That's what I need to get right now! Haha
[7:25:18] popzirl: zone of mastery ^
[7:25:22] saren8: pve i-lvl, embellish, missive, pvp
[7:25:28] saren8: so it's 2nd on the left
[7:25:32] thrakzr: Tysm @saren8
[7:25:46] TheEyeVII: trill said he uses the mastery wrist on his dh, idk if it's still good

[7:31:54] sunileif: gross melee hunter D;
[7:32:02] sunileif: thats like a failed rogue
[7:32:13] sunileif: which is like the worst class
[7:32:28] popzirl: they're broken in pvp and right under rogue in pve
[7:32:32] sunileif: buff MM
[7:33:24] sunileif: hmmm soding dps charts
[7:33:30] popzirl: i went orc on hunter hoping melee was gnna be good eventually something diff i guess
[7:33:36] popzirl: pets still broken
[7:33:53] sunileif: nope says melee hunter top dps by alot
[7:33:57] sunileif: then spreist
[7:34:02] sunileif: or dps priest
[7:34:09] avenueone: melee hunter hurts
[7:34:24] avenueone: i got hit for 1k w 4k armor and a shield on

[7:35:22] popzirl: well
[7:35:24] avenueone: 1 raptor strike
[7:35:26] sunileif: a pitance then
[7:35:27] popzirl: yeah lol
[7:35:37] sunileif: just rub some salt on it and walk it off bruh
[7:35:45] atoker: mes, and chat... do you guys think that having 2 dhs will be good for the war within, because of possible different builds with hero talents?
[7:35:47] Shablagoosh: how do dhs play without the sigil at targets feet talent? everyone on armory skips it after rework
[7:36:17] saren8: you just cast @cursor
[7:36:20] sunileif: waht makes you think yu cant alternate between hero trees?
[7:36:21] popzirl: you just @cursor or @player it
[7:37:15] sunileif: scare beast
[7:37:45] popzirl: gnna resist lol
[7:37:52] atoker: @sunileif I still don't know how hero talents will be, even after all the videos I've seen
[7:38:19] sunileif: dark ranger looks sad
[7:38:41] popzirl: you're on crusader strike right?
[7:39:08] sunileif: the elite giants ont he coast?
[7:39:23] Shablagoosh: i wish dark ranger procced kill shots like flayed shot, not aimed charges
[7:40:07] TheEyeVII: i don't understand hero talents, makes no sense to me, why even do a buncha rows of passives & multipliers when we know w/e sims higher is gonna be meta.. just give people a new  button or something visually fun for their class? meh
[7:40:47] sunileif: well its sposed to make you "feel" like the hero class

[7:41:08] TheEyeVII: it's just passives tho, where's the feeling at
[7:41:12] sunileif: only dark ranger fails on that bit
[7:41:33] sunileif: yu get black arrow... again
[7:42:13] Shablagoosh: black arrow is sylvanas number 1 iconic ability tho
[7:42:15] Shablagoosh: since wc3 lol
[7:42:16] TheEyeVII: do passives bring cool visuals at least? for all classes
[7:42:19] Shablagoosh: pretty thematic
[7:42:49] sunileif: ya we fought sylvannas she does more than black arrow
[7:43:05] TheEyeVII: she also does reee
[7:44:47] sunileif: @Shablagoosh you drinking tha tkool aid man
[7:45:03] popzirl: seemed to be less mobs if you pulled north
[7:45:14] popzirl: from where the giants were
[7:45:16] sunileif: you sure its not the sea giants on the coast?
[7:45:49] Shablagoosh: @sunileif I don't like it, I wish it was kill shot procs, but it is black arrow, chains, shadow arrows, undead minions thats pretty much entire sylvanas

[9:46:45] waitimdesyncd: wizk was ranting about it, but you can venge at different times
[9:46:50] waitimdesyncd: like venge right as hunt goes off
[9:46:50] atoker: it was a lot lower for me in shuffle so I dropped the 4 piece

[9:49:58] sunileif: NODDERS
[9:50:00] waitimdesyncd: the unpeelable thing where you insta apply the big hit, and another one that applies the dot to everyone even though you dont charge through them, as I understood it
[9:50:02] sunileif: both hean irl
[9:50:05] sunileif: here'
[9:50:14] sunileif: both here and irl'
[9:50:29] waitimdesyncd: yeah i think its a pve trick to pad the meter

[10:15:13] harleyjaymes: Dude, I need the same set up you got. how do i get that interface and the addons
[10:22:55] figurines: someone needs to make a full addon that is an entire UI for pvp. new players need this so bad
[10:28:06] Ronsimus: @figurines or just disable all addons for arena, that would be my pick
[10:31:52] Alegral: u seen legendary soda speech ? https://clips.twitch.tv/PrettyHonestWallabyBCWarrior-CJ_8th2sR9kmSu08
[10:33:35] Alegral: it worth to watch that show just for this moment LUL
[10:33:37] Ronsimus: what is ur take on addons mes?
[10:33:42] Ronsimus: yey or ney?
[10:33:56] Ronsimus: yesd
[10:34:18] Ronsimus: would make it harder to play, but in a fun way
[10:34:28] Alegral: yes remove every addon build important things into game ! xd

[10:35:06] wowsuomi: Pretty loaded question
[10:36:13] Ronsimus: i think more people would enjoy it without addons. there will be bigger differences between players.
[10:37:10] wowsuomi: Changing something thats been in the game for 19 years
[10:38:34] Ronsimus: have to disagree
[10:38:44] wowsuomi: I would never made gold without addons in my garrison in wod
[10:38:55] waitimdesyncd: there is a legal 1button auto rotation bot that has thousands of players making scripts (the better the script maker is the better the script), and somehow that is OK because it helps people with disabilities
[10:39:41] waitimdesyncd: I found out about that yesterday
[10:40:28] waitimdesyncd: and the bot is an addon on curseforge and it can do some pretty nutty shit if youre good at scripting
[10:40:49] Ronsimus: i really dont think I do
[10:42:02] Ronsimus: i think people would adapt rather quickly and i dont think the game would be harder, rather easier
[10:43:49] wowsuomi: Its like Skyrim with mods
[10:44:04] wowsuomi: I think it makes the game better
[10:47:50] Ronsimus: i feel like addons is something people felt they had to use to compete. If u lower the playing-field and put everyone in the same boat. I dont think would feel the same about addons
[10:48:40] happyheals: cool thing is : People don't have to use add-ons
[10:48:43] figurines: @waitimdesyncd lol no shot theres an adodn that does everything for you
[10:49:41] Tiebot87: @notmes is chuck a pres main now? is shaman number 2?
[10:49:50] Gooseberries: Both sides are like crack fiends with add-ons
[10:50:35] Blaze150000: why is there so little pvp players  compared to pve players?
[10:51:38] Blaze150000: at 1600 cr u need good game knowledge ?
[10:51:44] wowsuomi: Even as DH
[10:51:52] meiscorn: its good to hear that from a pro. bc so many people say its sooo easy in pvp
[10:52:25] Blaze150000: so if some one push above 2k he is a damm good player ?
[10:52:31] wowsuomi: 1600 Start of season or ead of season /1 haha
[10:52:48] Ronsimus: if you look at popularity of "classic" and old wow in general I think there is an argument to be maid that the game could be made much better without the needs of addons. that include the pve of things, but i guess we have to agree to disagree
[10:53:33] Ronsimus: because they can
[10:53:51] Ronsimus: i dont think so

[10:55:01] Farz82: remove addons in pvp 100% and i will come back lol
[10:55:02] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[10:55:11] Farz82: well weakauras
[10:55:23] Farz82: jesus lol
[10:55:34] CompulsiveDabber: if they removed addons or weakauras i just would stop playing the game full stop
[10:55:38] happyheals: People who have an issue with add ons and weak auras probably aren't doing the level of content that requires them the most
[10:56:36] Farz82: I can assure you i def did the content where they helped.
[10:57:03] wowsuomi: Hardcore would never of existed with out addons
[10:57:37] Farz82: but at the sametime to have a weakaura tellingyou every time someone pops something instead of it being required of the player to pay attention and note it. i dunno just more my feels than anything
[10:57:41] happyheals: I say probably, because I am sure there are a bit of people that have high level history that don't like them
[10:57:53] Ronsimus: @happyheals so not true. Ive palyed wow for 20 years, every aspect of it. I love my UI and addons, but for the welfare of the game and recruiting new players, it would better without I think
[10:57:56] Zenlyn: p sure blizz could put a zone wide aura into every arena that blocks certain addon's from accessing api's to track stuff it obv wouldnt be an overnight fix but it'd stop alot of it in its tracks, there would be weird workarounds but for the masses it'd remove most addons no?
[10:58:59] Farz82: i think the problem is too far gone to try and limit any aspect now. they would lose more than they gained on blizz side
[10:59:05] Ronsimus: remove access to combatlog in arena
[11:00:13] Knaitx: people who asks to remove addons are the ones that would use third party programs and cheats to track cds in place of addons
[11:00:27] FateIRL: do you think your ele will see any play in awc?
[11:01:14] simszszy: PogChamp
[11:01:26] wowsuomi: I used it in cata
[11:01:31] StreamElements: Get 50% off your first Factor75 box + Free Wellness Shots for Life using my link! Two free wellness shots per order with an active subscription https://strms.net/factor75_notmes #ad
[11:01:42] FateIRL: ppl used gladiatorlossa in cata
[11:01:48] pedrayy: @Zenlyn honestly just remove the api at this point, pve boss fights are literally relying on addons to be done which would have to be changed, and the only actual necessary thing in pvp which is missing is dr, blizzard could easily put it there if 30 addons do it
[11:01:48] FateIRL: at the time it was insane
[11:02:22] FateIRL: im gonna be honest theres too much going on in the game to play without addons/weakauras
[11:02:36] Ronsimus: the pvp side of the game is declining alot. Its basicly now only a mode for veterans of the game. They can continue what they are doing and it will die out completly with time
[11:02:58] Gcannonz: Weakauras I use for this I just need to be able to see
[11:03:08] figurines: pvp would have to be simplified an immense amount for addons to matter less. not sure thats what we as a community really want
[11:03:09] Gcannonz: I'm blind in one eye so it helps lol
[11:03:09] figurines: i dunno
[11:03:30] wowsuomi: Using it was insane because at the time everyone had a lo less awareness bck then
[11:03:41] Farz82: This is why i <3 you mes lol
[11:03:43] Ronsimus: no...
[11:03:56] Ronsimus: im talking about barrier to entry
[11:04:39] luckydyldo: Dont think so no
[11:04:41] mengon: It's good the entry barrior is high. Don't bait new players into PvP
[11:04:43] figurines: on a base level pvp is fun. when you get into the micro of managing every little thing you can possibly do and what you should kick and managing DR and...people just use nannies to make that stuff easier and therefore make the game more fun
[11:04:44] Ronsimus: ofcourse, less UI complexity with make it easier for new players to try pvp
[11:04:51] pedrayy: there isnt much of a barrier to entry, you just install weakaura addon and import a weakaura package
[11:04:57] pedrayy: its a chore more than a barrier to entry
[11:05:08] Ronsimus: they can, but they would be destroyed
[11:05:24] luckydyldo: I think people overblow the amount of addons you really need to start pvping you legit need like 5 addons
[11:05:37] luckydyldo: I also agree with that
[11:05:44] figurines: like the amount of kickbots and dispel bots and wont let you press CC if the guy is on DR or not casting and rotation bots. Obviously everyday player wants things simplified.
[11:06:09] luckydyldo: If the game completely removed addons new players would get shit on even somewhat experienced players too
[11:06:14] Ronsimus: both me and you agree, that for the health of the game, we need a bigger playerbase and the barrier to entry is too high
[11:06:15] pedrayy: but its also the same thing for any other game, first time i played league i was getting oneshot left right and center
[11:06:25] FateIRL: at the very least you need sArena
[11:06:30] FateIRL: and bigdebuffs
[11:06:38] FateIRL: game is unplayable without
[11:06:47] Ronsimus: sure
[11:07:34] Ronsimus: 100%
[11:07:45] atoker: templates gave more stats depending on ilvl in legion
[11:07:49] Ronsimus: its a mmo, u need progression
[11:07:54] Gcannonz: Cata was my fav
[11:08:15] pedrayy: but it cant give power either
[11:08:22] figurines: You gotta make pvp a lot more similar to pve. It's like an entirely seperate game iwth different gear different addons and you need an entirely different amount of game knowledge.
[11:08:42] Farz82: Yea like I was saying before. The addon/weakaura thing is too deep at this point to do any corrective action for the most part. It would not benefit blizz in anyway because at this point if you break a ton of stuff, people inately hate massive change and they would lose mroe than they gained
[11:08:51] luckydyldo: Unironically i remember in Shadowlands S1 i remember pve players complaing the easiest way to get a 226 weap was to get elite in pvp
[11:09:42] wowsuomi: Arenalogs
[11:10:05] Gcannonz: I still remember going to warcraftmovies to watch a good player just to learna few small things
[11:10:42] wowsuomi: Even just learning new things from clips
[11:11:06] figurines: I mean classic players are gone. those are the guys who could only press buttons real slow and never learned. classic saved them and now pvp is full of ultra sweats
[11:11:12] luckydyldo: I think part of the issue is also the divide of 3's vs Solo shuffle you already have a small portion of the playerbase and then you split it more between the 2
[11:11:21] Farz82: big brain tbh
[11:11:37] crucybletv: either give me a mount for shuffle or fix LFG so i can get the "difficult" rewards from pvp
[11:11:45] Gcannonz: Pvp is the best part of the game
[11:11:56] FateIRL: if you ban addons/ weakauras you lose the casual audience
[11:11:57] Ronsimus: they have invested very little into making pvp good imo. When it actually have a huge potential
[11:11:58] Gcannonz: Open world pvp was the best I think
[11:12:14] drazzah: drazzah subscribed at Tier 1. 
[11:12:14] StreamElements: drazzah just subscribed mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[11:12:26] Farz82: they need to entice me to come back lol
[11:12:30] figurines: you also play at the top end of hte ladder. so its especially not about you. need more casuals and sub 2k players to return
[11:12:34] waitimdesyncd: I will adapt to anything and everything and still play. Cuz im addicted to arena and Retail has the best arena pvp
[11:12:38] Farz82: yea 100%
[11:12:39] wowsuomi: Try doing high level keys eithout addons
[11:12:50] pedrayy: i think blizz's top priority for pvp is to somehow fix soloq, the 1 hour queues and being the only mode in which you have to play 6 times and may even get +0 rating discourages a lot of ppl
[11:12:58] pedrayy: but then again there arent many ppl playing for it to not be 1h queues
[11:13:01] figurines: it has to be fun to lose a game. it can't be fun to only win
[11:13:08] Gcannonz: I'm more casual these days but the only addon I even truly like using is Gladius
[11:13:19] mengon: It's to late
[11:13:36] luckydyldo: Well thats what SS was for no? but nobody wants to sit 30 min queues
[11:13:49] jujujay_myalias: I used to only PvE but my BIS as Prot warrior in TBC Classic included some arena gear so I was forced into the arena and it got me into it and I was enthusiastically PvPing by wrath
[11:14:01] figurines: they dont actively balance pvp to make a good product. the issues are 100% them not putting time into it. even just logical class turning on a regular basis would be huge
[11:14:12] wowsuomi: I just realise no auctionator nah f that
[11:14:29] FateIRL: now that you mention it, s1/s2 shadowlands had insane participation because of that
[11:15:04] luckydyldo: dont you dare talk shit about 5.2

[11:15:13] waitimdesyncd: Yeah but at that point every other expansion was lit
[11:15:20] figurines: the few remaining pvp players that I played with this xpac are quitting or on SoD now. Regardless of bringing in pve player we aren't putting enough effort in to retain existing players
[11:16:03] waitimdesyncd: no, but legion was pretty lit, no?
[11:16:03] Ronsimus: @figurines very true
[11:16:29] pedrayy: wasnt there like 4k ppl above 2400 in 3s in sl s1

[11:16:46] waitimdesyncd: we did pile in on pve in BFA s4
[11:16:58] waitimdesyncd: getting essences, azerite, corruptions, visions
[11:16:59] figurines: As long as interlinking the communities doesn't force me back into m+ or choregast or w/e
[11:17:16] Gcannonz: I liked every season in Cata
[11:17:26] Ronsimus: i miss doing pve to get good pvp gear, but thats just me
[11:17:30] jujujay_myalias: I think PvPers tend to be irritated having to raid for gear. In their defence it's a lot harder to get into organized PvE for specific items than the reverse
[11:17:32] raeza444: SL benefitted from the pandemic
[11:17:40] mynameistwavis: 2nd or 3rd week i had glad lol
[11:17:40] Gcannonz: I main rogue and rogue in cata was the most fun to me
[11:18:02] altopstra: time to show the shadowland season 1 dragon mount
[11:18:07] wowsuomi: Thats the opposite of Venrukis take, He doesn't want to be forced to pve
[11:18:08] figurines: slands was just pve players buying carries. quit that season as it was so unfun
[11:19:19] wubsyo: wubsyo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months!

[11:19:49] rscmadnes: I get nightmares about torghast
[11:20:00] jujujay_myalias: I like the idea that to be fully BIS you need to do all types of content and be an all round good players. Makes perfect sense as an rpg
[11:20:01] waitimdesyncd: I did a mythic +15 every week to get my gettiku in BFA S4, everyone who got their 475gettiku will remember it forever
[11:20:30] luckydyldo: I definitely have really good and fond memories from getting really good pve gear in bfa season 4
[11:20:38] Ronsimus: @waitimdesyncd same and i really enjoyed it from a psykological point of view
[11:20:45] wowsuomi: If they did it you have to do it both ways
[11:20:46] Mckriminal: you start nerfing dh :p
[11:20:48] atoker: having high level pvp gear that was competitive in pve would get me to pve again
[11:20:51] waitimdesyncd: @Ronsimus  yeah same
[11:21:01] pedrayy: i never had any fun in pve, it was so bad pugging my way in nyalotha to get drest trinket, but it was fun 50-0ing someone in a global, overlaps like that in some seasons feel bad and good at the same time
[11:21:05] figurines: you don't gain players without simplifying the pvp product immensly. first step: diminishing returns
[11:21:32] waitimdesyncd: @pedrayy  big same
[11:22:14] wowsuomi: In SL pvpers had to pve but pvers didn't have to pvp
[11:22:27] Ronsimus: @waitimdesyncd i think its important to have goal and things to stretch for. Nowdays, i log in, realize there is nothing to do. Jump around in circles for a few mins and log off
[11:22:34] pedrayy: @wowsuomi not entirely true
[11:22:57] pedrayy: a lot of pvers were pvping to get the badge trinket which was bis for some major fights
[11:23:07] atoker: @Ronsimus there's always something to do
[11:23:20] waitimdesyncd: @Ronsimus  yeah, I enjoyed visions too. A chance at getting a nice corruption or some gear
[11:23:34] Ronsimus: @waitimdesyncd same same
[11:24:11] Ronsimus: @atoker like what. there is no progression for me that likes to pvp
[11:24:16] wowsuomi: I was thinking other then the trinket i couldn't think of any other time
[11:24:26] waitimdesyncd: but I had ptsd from haste corruption lock/mage D:
[11:24:51] Chillinar: who the fuck liked visions?! shit was horrible
[11:25:02] Chillinar: I still have 50 keys in my bank...
[11:25:04] waitimdesyncd: shit was fun as fuck when you were goot at it
[11:25:08] waitimdesyncd: goo*
[11:25:13] waitimdesyncd: good* lul
[11:25:16] Chillinar: no
[11:25:23] Ronsimus: i really enjoyed the visions at the start when they were hard
[11:25:24] atoker: @Ronsimus leveling alts on a 2nd account while your in queue can be done... or working on professions... gold quests... world pvp quests
[11:25:25] Chillinar: stormwind was the worst
[11:25:32] pedrayy: i liked visions, just didnt like that you had to do it regardless of wanting to or not lol
[11:25:38] waitimdesyncd: made good money boosting it with PVP gear, could boost friends in gear, and it was skillbased
[11:25:40] Chillinar: with them dumb circles affix bleh
[11:26:08] waitimdesyncd: I could bring my homies on a 5 mask run on their fresh alt and get them insane gear and PVP gear was perfect for it
[11:26:21] Chillinar: took me like 500 runs to get the mail muncher..
[11:26:22] Ronsimus: @atoker i dont feel like having a second account... I do some professions etc for gold.. but again.. its very limited
[11:26:35] waitimdesyncd: took me less than 12 lol
[11:26:36] wowsuomi: Some ppls memories are better then others haha
[11:27:13] atoker: @Ronsimus without a 2nd account you can't do 2s on a healer while in queue on dps
