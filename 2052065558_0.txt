[3:08:56] ama__deus: Nothing as sastifying as silencing mages. Looking forward to that. Still think It's BS they can blink while silenced 😡
[3:09:17] vrsswow: coz this is a 2nd year that he got title in his scool as most creative kid

[3:10:28] SireTV: hey @Hydramist - i've been reading more into shadow priests for SOD, but I had a question - it seems like a lot of the healer gear overlaps with the dps caster gear, right?
[3:11:59] ama__deus: Just disable comments Kappa
[3:12:10] SireTV: @vrsswow your son needs to be at least level 13 irl before making a YT
[3:12:10] Reachhx: hey hydra whats the setting for highlighting magig buffs on unitframes?
[3:12:15] SireTV: otherwise it's not allowed
[3:12:53] Plushie__Tv: my cousins kid records pokemon card openings, hes 8 and the videos are private but hes still so chuffed to see them on youtube.  Maybe its a safer way to start

[3:15:14] kult1010: there is a typo in !discord @bryan :O

[4:37:34] snoopy239: it will just crash the market for magic dust.   The only way it will work is if before each GDKP, they pick an item to make it currency for the run.   Problem is it will make everyone fuck up the market if its abused
