[0:50:38] CeruleanStar: ah yeah it's weapon + spec
[0:50:42] CeruleanStar: weapon alone isn't
[0:50:57] WymGaming: Then just your offensive build with DW is 12k more than what you have equipped
[0:51:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: ff14 fan fest, d4 campfire, and exile con all in the same day
[0:51:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: should be

[0:58:55] flookguy: I’m probably not playing it right but since 10.1.5 I’ve been getting my cheeks clapped playing VDH
[0:59:01] dimofodi: I'm missing 1 item from the boss drop transmog....have almost all vendor stuff but the weapons you buy with tokens.
[0:59:12] mc85000: @Towelliee Question. in Diablo 4. I'm in. World tier 3 Getting absolutely destroyed, Should I step down to world tier two? or keep fighting the struggle in World Tier three to. get unique items.

[1:00:55] dimofodi: Yeaaaaaa you get smacked at 440+ if you aren't careful too.
[1:00:58] fizzalf: @mc85000 my friends go buy kills per lvl so they are doing lower tear but going until they reach a sertain lvl

[1:01:37] Eshel: So your group matters too
[1:01:41] Molvonos: The old version is way more expensive

[1:12:15] flookguy: I mean I pretty sure blizz forgot WW monks exist
[1:12:25] Eshel: Negative ghost rider - rogues are still waiting for our rework that’s was supposed to be in last patch
[1:12:29] hisfrankness: Just for transmog reasons. Lol.
[1:12:30] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: my rotation has been the same for 4 expansions
[1:12:33] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: as hunter
[1:13:34] flookguy: All of monk needs a full rework. Makes no sense
[1:13:46] PidiaP: Ele and resto shaman are just like hunter in that they bring nothing unique to make you want to bring one to your group that enh doesn’t just do better

[1:19:45] Incredible_Sausage: LUL dude got benched
[1:20:01] Aethius: haha, I agree. I was just being a little sarcastic :P @91Niki
[1:20:07] 91Niki: Maybe he did it on purpose to not have to go on anymore LUL
[1:20:10] Wulfgrym: he clutters the message or creates distractions which are not helping
[1:20:22] Robodope: hope they let those dude take a nap before this week's chat cause they looked tired as hell especially joe shely
[1:20:46] abracka_: https://imgflip.com/i/7twqrv
[1:20:52] Robodope: i doubt it was the launch it was probably the reaction to the patch
[1:20:59] Mack_n: IS D4 worth it for a guy who hasn't played the former Diablogames?
[1:21:09] Mecabeast: I think we will have a talk about ui stuff since it's been allover twitter people getting banned for using 3rd party software to alter the diablo ui
[1:21:42] jerseyfive: @Mack_n not for the price right now , wait for a sale imo
[1:21:43] 91Niki: @Mack_n If you like ARPGs, for sure!
[1:21:59] hisfrankness: God that job sounds like such a dream. I'd love to be a developer.
[1:22:14] 91Niki: @Mack_n and like someone said, if you don't wanna justify the price right now, wait for the a sale
[1:23:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: the gem system sounds soooo much better to me
[1:23:15] Robodope: i'm ready for more POE i haven't played since the start of the last league
[1:23:47] 91Niki: @HaxzorJimDuggan But that very much depends, are you familiar with the game and somewhat decently understand it now, then yeah the gem system seems better, but for new players who still haven't learned, not so much
[1:24:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah true
[1:24:09] reggiepowa: some quality of life is good but they shouldn't dumb down the game too much. poe was always targeting very specific niche of players and we need games that do that
[1:24:19] Robodope: i just follow build guides every league and see no shame in it. there's so much content to learn in that game
[1:24:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Web-based auction houses are janky, definitely can be better
[1:24:52] 91Niki: @wEiRdO_dUdE Yeah, sadly the devs are very anti "auction house" type systems
[1:24:52] Robodope: i don't really have problems with the trade site. i think the janky part is that most people run a pricing addon

[1:25:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: one of the things i saw is now it won't be possible for people to link a gem to another gem that doesn't have some effect, right now you could put two gems together that do nothing
[1:25:36] Robodope: i'm not sure if RF is actually a beginner build. you have to do specific things to make it work. but those specifics are WELL documented by RF enthusiasts
[1:25:54] Aethius: I love summoner builds but the AI always sucks on them. Last Epoch had the best summoner due to how much control over your minions you have
[1:25:54] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[1:26:18] mi3f: hardest part of POE for me is finding reliable information on specs
[1:26:41] Robodope: yeah it's a starter because you dont need gear. you just need to know what nodes to pick. and its easy because there are RF fans that write real detailed guides
[1:26:42] ScalarGaming: ScalarGaming subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 94 months! 
[1:26:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: one thing I would love is if they remove the xp penalty from dying. feels so bad when you just get gibbed and have no idea how you died and you lose progress as a result
[1:26:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: not holding my breath on that though
[1:27:03] Plaen: Plaen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 60 months! 
[1:27:17] Mecabeast: So kinda like how in wow warlocks can turn their fire green?
[1:27:51] Robodope: yea, although in poe turning the fire green costs $
[1:28:05] Robodope: its how they make their money
[1:28:38] PrimalRain: I doubt it
[1:28:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: this is there chance to do it
[1:28:55] Robodope: well, at least poe 2 it's a new campaign
[1:29:33] reggiepowa: does this boss wipes you if he finishes cast?
[1:29:33] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[1:29:47] Molvonos: @reggiepowa Yep
[1:30:07] Wulfgrym: if the new campaign doesn't have a skip option ill play it once maybe twice and quit
[1:30:15] Igrasie1: Igrasie1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! vamos
[1:30:24] Robodope: i'm pretty sure its a whole new campaign but who knows the details
[1:30:32] mi3f: i dont see them focusing on the story.  that's the part no one really gives a crap about, but it would be cool
[1:30:48] kitchensynk: Oye Toweliee long time no see man.
[1:31:11] Robodope: it would be nice to just jump straight into maps or delve or something but i dont really mind the campaign
[1:31:27] mi3f: yeah barbs feel so bad atm
[1:32:27] Wulfgrym: we love the story but you dont want to run it for yeas

[1:32:38] Robodope: i dont think anyone cares about the story, d4 or poe, after several seasons
[1:32:55] Robodope: guess we'll find out tomorrow
[1:32:58] mi3f: i think having it be skippable makes you appreciate the story more since you don't need to do it over and over again and kill the fun of it
[1:32:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: We love skips
[1:33:03] smashwow: if poe2 turns out like ow2 we got problems
[1:33:12] mavericks312: i just dont know if PoE cares about holding onto the casual base
[1:33:20] maustercheese: there is indeed going to be certain things different from what is known
[1:33:30] smashwow: yes
[1:33:34] skylaars: poe2 will be free to play, yes?
[1:33:37] smashwow: that's my point

[1:34:29] KaisenSiru: Overwatch Pog
[1:34:52] BoezIRL: are you doing the hard mode?
[1:35:01] SSD511_: towChad
[1:35:19] maustercheese: like there is not much that they have shown yet other than there will be shapeshifting stuff and sockets will be much easier to deal with(that's all i can remember atm, there was not much more anyways really)
[1:36:34] atsq1: Quick run
[1:37:00] BoezIRL: can't use it
[1:37:07] alluza: you cant use it its 2h
[1:37:19] BoezIRL: no
[1:37:27] maustercheese: it should be interesting to see what they do show off tomorrow
[1:37:27] alluza: nope

[3:15:39] abracka_: @Sollice if you go on amazon, checkout the huanuo monitor stand. i use it for my PC tower and it's very sturdy/reliable. it's long and wide enough to hold a tower
[3:15:46] Sollice: When Twitch does H265 or AV1 encoding its going to be a game changer

[3:32:43] AnimalCrackers_19: I got all the gear before the D4 lauch it was crazy fast how you could gear up
[3:32:45] cyrex172: you guys are tempting me to reinstall wow and try again, i wont do it tho!
[3:32:47] 3663Sharad: I finally found some time to do my alts since a long time
[3:32:51] cyrex172: i even bought dragonflight...
[3:33:04] RagingPunk: i hope they just release the game next week
[3:33:10] Wildsmasher: what game is that i only speak Diablo
[3:33:12] PinkDolphinSkincare: I played PoE for 2 days.. just couldnt dig it
[3:33:15] Affiiance: The tactical nuke fired at D4?
[3:33:43] cyrex172: PoE same, it was so minotonous
[3:34:03] Inthezonewow: Going from D3 to D4 is such a change in pace Sadge
[3:34:15] RagingPunk: dam unfortunate u gota folow a guide
[3:34:20] PinkDolphinSkincare: yeah, think I was just overwhelemd with everything.. maybe Ill take your advice and try again
[3:34:56] RagingPunk: true
[3:35:01] chaotikz7: I liked the cartoony feel of D3 over D4 myself. Too many realism games already
[3:35:02] Cal_Kat: they do it, then very quickly regret their decisions in life LUL
[3:35:05] TheLawwd: why does the SoO skip always dc?
[3:35:14] RagingPunk: i hope po2 is a bit more friendly to new ppl

[3:35:22] zysmos: gave poe a shot several times definitely not for me miserable experience every time
[3:35:38] cyrex172: to me PoE just felt unrespnsive and kind of amatuer whereas diablo feels like a blizzard game with ability responsiveness and obviously graphics and art style music etc which to me arent  insignificant
[3:36:05] RagingPunk: i cant knock on poe i just never got far in it

[3:36:10] Affiiance: I really just wanted D4 to be an graphical update for D3 with new classes/gear
[3:36:17] cyrex172: i actually liked the depth ope has i respect the hell out of it\\
[3:36:19] Affiiance: I love D3
[3:36:24] cyrex172: the depth of poe is great
[3:36:31] cyrex172: in terms of build creativity\
[3:36:35] cyrex172: i love d3 too..
[3:36:40] RagingPunk: yea i have respect for the poe guys they are dedicated
[3:36:40] zysmos: the game feels so unresponsive tho feel like there is latency built in this game hate it
[3:36:41] DunzoCD: the crafting in PoE is top tier as well
[3:36:46] cyrex172: and d2 i still play it
[3:36:49] 91Niki: @Affiiance Essentially they wanted D4 to be the best of D2 and D3. Cuz people love both
[3:37:11] RagingPunk: towLets towGo towHype
[3:37:16] RagingPunk: towDed
[3:37:54] KingSlayerYotam: I quit D4 cause it was slow, i though arpg should be faster gameplay. You can tell they learned nothing from wow gcd drama
[3:38:28] Affiiance: I will eventually get D4… enjoying my OP Augvoker right now
[3:38:35] cyrex172: im excited to see where d4 goes despite these early stage difficulties from incompetent balance teams at blizzard
[3:38:42] mavericks312: rogue and necro just obliterate everything lol
[3:38:58] RagingPunk: just gota wait for phill Kappa
[3:39:02] KingSlayerYotam: tried them all, but tbh i quit at around 40~50. Couldnt push myself to farm that much
[3:39:04] cyrex172: damn that TMNT movie looks kinda sick
[3:39:06] Affiiance: I’m sure, like D3, that D4 will get fixed in a year or so
[3:39:10] Jango_: level 55 poison rogues soling the 70 capstone
[3:39:14] 91Niki: @KingSlayerYotam Yeah rogue is super fast. However we are getting mob density buff. So that also might help with it feeling slow on that aspect
[3:39:16] Jango_: soloing*
[3:39:30] cyrex172: im running rogue r now

[3:46:17] cyrex172: yeha man
[3:46:28] ackdogg007: The season would have been just fine but the main issue was when they blew up the classes and the overall game with there bs patch everyone was just done and the fact that you still have massive stability issues

[3:46:35] zysmos: all these tcg items for the people

[6:30:23] AlphasaurusRexx: @HaxzorJimDuggan is this custom keyboard thing like a side hustle or a hobby?
[6:30:26] abracka_: @HaxzorJimDuggan not only that, but it'll help the economy not dip again and help the workers with getting the fair wages they deserve
[6:30:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: it could still happen later, but for now its not planned to start on august 1st as before
[6:30:47] Sollice: @HaxzorJimDuggan Hobby. I have like 15 keyboards with another 3 coming lol.

[6:47:25] FutileDiploma: @towelliee as a new prot pally first toon putting some time into should I go enchanting as profession or is it a waste as prot pally
[6:47:27] inj0shwetrust: 11s and lower and basically like heroic dungeons
[6:47:29] CGd0c: too ez
[6:47:33] Finansdepartementet: all these numberes

[6:48:03] cyrex172: i even already bought dragonflight...
[6:48:07] inj0shwetrust: get your key
[6:48:09] Onearmyof2: I thought 16 vault gives you 8/8 champion 441 gear and 17 gave you 441 1/3 myth gear
[6:48:11] cyrex172: and have my 60's
[6:48:24] inj0shwetrust: invite who ever you want

[6:48:55] herzlustafir: ill try again pls drop
[6:48:55] inj0shwetrust: 20s give you straight up 447 vaults
[6:48:55] abracka_: finish the entire zaralak caverns questline, loot some treasure alongside doing the questline. use the whelpling shadowflame crests and place a work order for enchanted whelpling's shadowflame crest. use the whelpling shadowflame crest to create a almost full 408 ilvl set.
[6:49:03] thomssone: so 16 is myth track?
[6:49:18] inj0shwetrust: no you dont now
[6:49:20] Murlocz: @towelliee Is there still a mount for all +15 in time?
[6:49:22] inj0shwetrust: big facts
[6:49:25] abracka_: then just do LFR and you're cruising
[6:49:28] raye_gaming22: vault is mythoc track yes 16s
[6:49:33] merlin__93: I think theres confusion around End of dungeon loot vs Vault loot at the end of the week
[6:49:34] inj0shwetrust: Yes @Murlocz
[6:49:39] cyrex172: @abracka_ thats the easirst way to get 408 ?
[6:49:44] inj0shwetrust: Keystone master mount
[6:49:45] Murlocz: Poggers
[6:49:50] abracka_: @cyrex172 by far
[6:49:53] Murlocz: Must be easy now
[6:50:09] inj0shwetrust: which this xpacs KSM are  underwhelming given its called Dragon flight and you dont geta flying dragon lol
[6:50:13] sackk69: whats favorite expansion of all time?
[6:50:17] Murlocz: Yeah no rep grind no atunement its only alt gearing and raids
[6:50:35] gemini903: imo gear is no long the barrier to entry. Plenty of 444 Ilvl people can't get a 20 done cause they just aint good enough
[6:50:43] Murlocz: @sackk69 Pandas for the win
[6:51:15] Ex0dUs101: Its made me come back, I dont have time with work and kids anymore so its been a blessing

[6:51:21] cyrex172: they will fuck it up
[6:51:26] Finansdepartementet: i like that, but id also like legendaries that take a long time to get. Kinda like the MoP cloaks
[6:51:28] SoriinX: WoWs future is bright if we keep this upgrade system
[6:51:37] FutileDiploma: Can you change professions after you pick one?
[6:51:37] abracka_: @cyrex172 once you're near that ilvl from doing what i said, run LFR. you'll get splintered spark of shadowflame, which turns into spark of shadowflame. you can use sparks of shadowflame to have 424 gear crafted
[6:52:06] Murlocz: So all these dragons are actually mounts usable outside of Dragonlands? Or they are a separated flying system
[6:52:09] death_cam_: crest system was the best ever for me
[6:52:11] mizerboy: The only thing I don't like about DF is the profession system
[6:52:14] raye_gaming22: there is stil problems with gearing like trinkes from keys but is way better than before
[6:52:18] inj0shwetrust: This is by far better
[6:52:28] Nokterian: the crest system with the flightstones is the best thing
[6:52:30] cyrex172: @abracka_ im actualluy pasting what ur saying in a doc ill wiki all that shit later
[6:52:30] inj0shwetrust: for everyone
[6:52:31] Lintgamer: @Towelliee But make them BoA
[6:52:31] RoboMaximillion: I like upgrading raid gear
[6:52:38] RoboMaximillion: This is better
[6:52:38] Nokterian: easiest to gear up and level up
[6:52:42] kimmo_gaming: its a great system but there is always place for improvement
[6:53:26] Finansdepartementet: What do you think about account wide reputation?
[6:53:32] abracka_: @cyrex172 https://youtu.be/DWA0W0HJabg here's a good guide going over basically what i said. i didn't know this existed but it goes into detail better what you'll need to do
[6:53:46] Onearmyof2: I would pay 5-10 crests just for one to send to an alt at this point
[6:53:58] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Murlocz (warning)
[6:54:09] UltraKSlaya: true
[6:54:14] kimmo_gaming: exactly, and maybe dont make people do lower dungeons if you already passed that difficulty lol
[6:54:16] lorddrekken: especially with the renown
[6:54:23] lorddrekken: account wide would be great
[6:54:34] chickdrummer88: Still waiting on allowing factions to queue together
[6:54:35] cyrex172: @abracka_ thank u dude!
[6:54:51] jerseyfive: I want account wide everything!
[6:54:52] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || He's not Wrong? youtu.be/ITshVb1MN3Q
[6:54:58] Murlocz: @chickdrummer88 that would be epic
[6:55:01] xziyn: @chickdrummer88 Probably a spaghetti code thing lol
[6:55:12] TheGiant99: Why do people hate doing renown....it's literally just playing the game
[6:55:23] Murlocz: Imagine being able to have a gnome in every dungeon @chickdrummer88
[6:55:26] chickdrummer88: Yeah, I just want to be able to queue timewalking, LFR, etc with the rest of my guild
[6:55:48] abracka_: @cyrex172 once you're in that 408-410 ballpark, you can start doing m+ to get gear, create your own groups because you'll likely not get invited to any. keep the key below a +7 until you get more comfortable, as well as build your m+ IO score
[6:56:11] inj0shwetrust: after coming back to the game in middle end of BFA from being gone since Twilight raid in Cata...... I can tell you what theyre doing with retail right now is the best its been since I came back by a landslide
[6:56:30] abracka_: @cyrex172 you'll start at a +2 keystone, which upgrades to a +3, 4 or 5 depending on what time you finished it in. you can keep the key level downgraded, just search "dragonflight downgrade keystone" on google to find out ho9w
[6:56:35] Murlocz: @abracka_ thats really good advice tho, thats what i would do if im back to playing
[6:57:04] Murlocz: @inj0shwetrust Why classic players still hate it tho
[6:57:38] inj0shwetrust: I have no clue this is by far the better game my guess just huge copium levels and nostalgia
[6:57:47] cyrex172: @abracka_ what ilevel do i need to be to start the zalrak caverns questloine
[6:58:20] Murlocz: @inj0shwetrust Yeah the nostalgia factor is insane, also GDKPs and pvp maybe
[6:58:45] abracka_: @cyrex172 how much gold do you have? you could buy some 376 ilvl green pieces from the AH for a few hundred gold a pop
[6:58:55] inj0shwetrust: Idk I played wrath when it was retail ..... I got bored on classic and not being able to fly in those zones kills it for me
[6:58:55] ElmSpace: @cyrex172 You can do it an any ilvl but it might be easier if you spend some gold on green items that are 376

[6:59:31] khrovaa: What that’s nuts
[6:59:33] abracka_: @cyrex172 you can also do the time rifts now to get a currency once a week to purchase a 402 ilvl piece of gear, which is upgradable to 424
[6:59:34] inj0shwetrust: once you have that quality of life in game(being able to fly in Kalimdor etc etc) its very hard to go back

[6:59:41] Finansdepartementet: How are brewmasters doing?

[7:01:08] robbo1010: robbo1010 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[7:01:31] cyrex172: whats right below druid?
[7:02:07] vazdru1129: Druid is the "easiest" tank also, correct?  If someone wanted to get into tanking would you recommend that route?
[7:02:12] khrovaa: @towelliee just came back and am playing my paly, once I’m geared and want to mess with an alt, yoh recommend Druid? Never bear tanked beforr
[7:02:13] inj0shwetrust: Its player dependant ^ more so than class but Guardian Druids are bad ass right now
[7:02:24] cyrex172: blood dk?
[7:02:39] Murlocz: @towelliee Can you imagine that people are already pre bidding on shadowmorne quest itens on Classic GDKPS. Its going to cost around 1.2 mil gold lmao
[7:03:23] cyrex172: they should bring wow to xbox x it has full kb and mouse support
[7:03:32] cyrex172: it would bring so many more ppl in
[7:03:44] MrShimadaX: Is that hard mode or sissy mode?
[7:03:44] khrovaa: That’s DK is pumping lo
[7:03:51] cyrex172: and blizzard is owned by microsoft now
[7:03:58] cyrex172: or will be
[7:04:44] herzlustafir: really?
[7:05:02] cyrex172: hehe
[7:05:09] sackk69: there is talk they'll combine WOW sub with game pass
[7:05:11] TheGiant99: Started a necro in D4 for the first time ever and enjoying it so far
[7:05:24] TheGiant99: Wow would do great on xbox
[7:05:31] NickLeonhearth: But give me an option to see if players are on console, so i can not inv them
[7:06:06] khrovaa: WoW with no addons lol
[7:06:19] jerseyfive: high keys are all about the route and right pulls, tanks dont matter until really really high keys
[7:06:22] Sollice: They could do add ons. Doesnt xbox have add ons for ESO or Fallout?
[7:06:27] sackk69: there is physically not enough buttons for console lmao
[7:06:36] Glynn11: for real, wow is one of the few things my shitty thinkpad can run well
[7:06:44] ryosh86: You have cut your hair! You look good mate
[7:06:49] Molvonos: especially for monk players.
[7:06:59] Murlocz: @glynn11 is it that bad tho?
[7:06:59] LuiBMHunter: console would work for hunter :)
[7:07:09] TheGiant99: People use controller for wow now
[7:07:21] cyrex172: yeah skyrim and fallout had add ons im pretty sure
[7:07:21] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[7:07:23] Sollice: If you see a HUGE ability trim this coming blizzcon you will know
[7:07:32] raye_gaming22: try to play priest druid or monk with controler they have 30+ keybinds
[7:07:41] lorddrekken: might have preferred to buy D4 on console
[7:07:43] TheGiant99: Sit on couch and play
[7:07:46] carmelchaos: Its to reach a wider audiance if anything, more money.
[7:07:48] Glynn11: @Murlocz not at all. able to do ~ medium settings
[7:07:52] LuiBMHunter: blizzcon - all talents gone! - autoattack only!
[7:07:53] SoriinX: Well the way i see it is to be able to play with a controller, Also.. why not?
[7:07:57] Brodih_: how is it even possible with a gamepad?
[7:07:57] kokochris: but @Towelliee can i play it on my toaster...
[7:08:11] cyrex172: ibut u can have a kb and a mouse.... on xbox
[7:08:13] Murlocz: I would have an anxiety atack playing it on Console. The sensibility turning around etc the response timer, the limited buttons yikes @towelliee
[7:08:15] veroggo99: controller is fun on pc :D
[7:08:16] khrovaa: It’ll play like shit
[7:08:23] hammack52: considering the most button heavy class in wow has nothing on the lowest button class in FF14 there is enough buttons for it to be played on consol, thing is the boss fights would have to be dumbed down
[7:08:25] jkitchin75: some just want to see the world burn
[7:08:28] TheGiant99: Ivdont want it on gamepass.
[7:08:31] Murlocz: @glynn11 Im looking for a new one
[7:08:31] cizal: No thanks who the hell would wanna play wow on a controller
[7:08:32] carmelchaos: towDed  then it sounds silly to me.
[7:08:37] Molvonos: Game can't handle a cluster of people in these new Time Rifts, you think an XBox will do better?
[7:08:37] jerseyfive: well there is room for a game now that everyone uninstalled diablo Kappa
[7:08:38] cyrex172: i play halo infinite with a kb and mouse
[7:08:41] cruzeal: tow speaking truth
[7:08:53] cyrex172: on my xbox
[7:08:56] RansumFSU: 2004 technology on PS5
[7:09:05] Murlocz: Thankfully LUL
[7:09:11] uglla3np: parents of 14year olds play wow nowadays
[7:09:13] veroggo99: yup you can just play with a controller wow pc lol
[7:09:14] flookguy: Why not? Just make it so you have to use a mouse and keyboard? Like they still need to pay the subscription but why wouldn’t that bring more people to the game?
[7:09:16] Murlocz: Let them in Fortnite
[7:09:17] herzlustafir: imagine a raid mythic on xbox.. its gonna be shiiit
[7:09:19] Finansdepartementet: they think wow is for old people
[7:09:21] 3dRes: WoW crossplay KEKW
[7:09:21] herzlustafir: ill tell u that
[7:09:24] Glynn11: @Murlocz for job purposes, the thinkpad is a workhorse. but any gaming will always be limited by their graphics card
[7:09:31] Va1ham: Va1ham subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 73 months! 
[7:09:34] xziyn: Pretty sure it's older folks wanting to play on their sofa with a controller lol
[7:09:42] MenacingMeow: Stop comparing WoW to XIV, XIV was built from the ground up to be playable with a controller
[7:09:47] hammack52: while i do think that one day WoW will be ported to consol, it will never get put on the game pass
[7:09:48] zoovthepally: use warcraft ip and make a console/pc adventure game or something
[7:09:54] smashwow: yeah no cross play mmo can stay over in ff14 land

[7:10:13] cyrex172: sorry guys i didnt mean to bring up a bad subject we can keep wow on pc thats ok
[7:10:20] TheGiant99: ESO works on console why not wow? And I don't mean on gamepass. Still need a sub to play
[7:10:43] herzlustafir: they will lose the oldtimers for sure
[7:10:56] AlphasaurusRexx: doesnt eso have like 7 buttons
[7:11:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: FFXIV is also on console, and one time Phil Spencer said he wants it on Xbox
[7:11:04] xziyn: @xziyn The most vocal people about porting it on console are definitely not kids
[7:11:24] abracka_: ESO has 6 buttons
[7:11:25] lorddrekken: eso is on gamepass
[7:11:27] Murlocz: Whats the difficulty of this dungeon? I dont see any mythic + timer
[7:11:32] abracka_: or 12 i guess
[7:11:36] hammack52: just because a game might go to the xbox does not mean it has to go on to game pass
[7:11:44] TheGiant99: You have ri but eso yes
[7:11:49] smashwow: uh... you see how many buttons wow has right?
[7:11:51] TheGiant99: To buy
[7:11:52] Murlocz: @abracka_ Yeah it could work for ESO and GW2
[7:11:56] AlphasaurusRexx: yeah 6 buttons vs the potential of 30 if youre playing brewmaster. things would have to get simple

[7:12:34] uglla3np: u ena xbox
[7:12:37] inj0shwetrust: nopers

[7:12:49] AlphasaurusRexx: im 9/10 not inviting crossplayers
[7:12:50] raye_gaming22: insta kick
[7:12:57] Armdel: thats very elitist of you sir! Kappa
[7:13:03] Finansdepartementet: cant discriminate man, i signed the social ToS

[7:13:21] herzlustafir: no sir
[7:13:23] flookguy: Oh hell no
[7:13:26] skrin001: i love xbox but I would never play wow on it.
[7:13:35] Sollice: I have a 77 inch oled if I could try WoW and it was function on XBOX or PS5 I would try it
[7:13:35] TheGiant99: It's nice to sit back on the couch and game
[7:13:41] cyrex172: lol
[7:13:45] smashwow: i don't even own a xbox because i own a PC
[7:13:46] Sindova: They would need to fundamentally change the whole game, and integrate a full suite of features that replicate mandatory combat add-ons.
[7:13:46] instant_savage: i would like to be able to lay in bed and do my tmog and mount farming runs but i wouldnt try to do keys or anything like that on there
[7:13:46] cyrex172: im super awk sorry tow
[7:13:50] thomssone: fucking reddit at again I think
[7:13:51] skrin001: 2536
[7:13:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Console porting is not for us, though, it's for new players
[7:13:59] hammack52: thing is its not about if we think it is needed or not it will be about do they think it will make money, if their data says it will than they will put it on consol
[7:13:59] TheGiant99: What solice said
[7:14:00] instant_savage: but daiies or tmog runs would be cool for console
[7:14:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: PS5 just went over 40 million units sold
[7:14:08] Murlocz: If people think that raider IO andys are elitist, wait till then can see you play on Xbox LUL @towelliee
[7:14:15] cyrex172: NotLikeThis
[7:14:21] Finansdepartementet: Get an hdmi cable and plug your computer into the tv and then get a couch keyboard

[7:16:00] polaropposite76: @TheGiant99 meh in this case it's not console hate, it just wouldn't make sense
[7:16:14] Murlocz: @thegiant99 They would definitely presume that you cannot play as good as you could using a Keyboard
[7:16:19] Sollice: Has anyone tried Bokksu Japanese box delivery? Or any other Japanese box food delivery? random question I know
[7:16:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Overwatch2 "Platforms: PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Xbox Series X and Series S"
[7:16:36] TheGiant99: Then why do people hate d4 is on console
[7:16:41] AlphasaurusRexx: i dont hate console. i prefer games like guild wars and eso on console. Diablo series and POE feel insanely good on console. WoW is just integrated with its addons to make the switch
[7:17:09] MenacingMeow: @sollice I’ve tried Bokksu and one Tokyo Treat
[7:17:11] Molvonos: towDynt towDynt
[7:17:12] raye_gaming22: @cyrex172 ofc they do an FIFA and NBA but not WoW all my RL Console freidns dont even know how WoW looks like
[7:17:16] boostedeg93: lmfao
[7:17:16] RoboMaximillion: Do u need
[7:17:19] cruzeal: towDynt
[7:17:19] Sollice: @MenacingMeow What did you think between the two?
[7:17:34] cyrex172: u can use keyboards on console right and can probably do add ons too if fallout did it
[7:17:39] cyrex172: jus sayin
[7:17:56] cyrex172: lool
[7:17:58] Murlocz: @thegiant99 idk but Diablo 4 definitely do not have the minmaxing that end game have in WoW
[7:18:05] Murlocz: As a MMO
[7:18:06] 3dRes: This is starting to get sad
[7:18:09] cyrex172: imm trying to make a counter argument though it may be weak

[7:19:05] its_andyd: holy shit i went up and rolled a blunt and came back 10 minutes later and youre still on wow on console
[7:19:14] Finansdepartementet: but microsoft is an ethical company
[7:19:18] cyrex172: that dude got a cool mount
[7:19:18] MenacingMeow: @sollice if you want common snacks, Tokyo Treat and ones like it are nice, Bokksu has more artisanal snacks but is more expensive, I think the quality was worth it though
[7:19:18] Yagr6: skyrim has add on for console
[7:19:25] brewgamingtv: lol
[7:19:25] cyrex172: yeah fuck him for keeping the cool mount bru
[7:19:31] cyrex172: so selfish
[7:19:32] polaropposite76: LUL
[7:19:32] zoovthepally: i wonder if gamepass will have a "pass us a bit more and get access to wow" kinda thing

[7:19:51] hammack52: @Towelliee just because they may or may not put WoW on a console does not mean they HAVE to put the damn thing on Xbox pass, they can still leave it as a sub based game

[7:22:15] Stixxerz: you would be surprissed how many modders would jump on that offer
[7:22:23] jkitchin75: dont play wow on pc letalone xbox
[7:22:29] Yagr6: sure
[7:22:30] thomssone: they would move the cursor with the joystick LUL
[7:22:32] alex12645: it can work on d4
[7:22:42] Fawcheddar: world first PS4

[7:23:30] TheGiant99: Ok let's not do wow. Why do players have a issue d4 is on console
[7:23:33] Mecabeast: They'd probably play with proximity chat too
[7:23:40] Yagr6: then microsoft could market a mmo controller

[7:27:36] smashwow: is that tomorrow?
[7:27:46] Sadisticmedic: POE 2 and Season
[7:27:52] smashwow: was half listening
[7:27:58] Sollice: Clever like a fox
[7:28:06] abracka_: big brain strat
[7:28:07] Sadisticmedic: Tomorrow is ARPG day of D4 and POE
[7:28:21] polaropposite76: datmodz isn't online....what do I do now.... actually work?
[7:28:26] smashwow: i mean blizzard not having a ladder until season 3 is almost the nail in the coffin.
[7:28:48] TheGiant99: D4 will be fine
[7:29:06] zoovthepally: yeah just should have been fine sooner
[7:29:15] abracka_: prepare the wallets boys
[7:29:45] smashwow: d4 might be ok. but poe2 gonna eat up the players if they launch with a ladder and better leveling experience
[7:30:12] TheGiant99: Still game has been a couple months
[7:30:28] Madknox: Oh damn you going poe ? :D
[7:30:59] smashwow: yeah but it's 2023 it's not like they didn't know about a ladder and seasonal game play. they had d3 and poe as a reference
[7:31:01] Sollice: Oh shit Homeworld remastered for free on Epic store today almost forgot
[7:31:12] TheGiant99: You should check the numbers. Not as many people play poe as you think
[7:31:16] smashwow: just saying that's turned a lot of players off
[7:31:33] smashwow: people play poe in seasonal terms
[7:31:44] Nokterian: yeah
[7:32:06] smashwow: sure numbers aren't good now. but the first month of a seasonal it's usually pretty high

[7:32:07] Madknox: omg that soundtrack makes me wanna install it to!!
[7:32:34] Yagr6: old ass game smh
[7:32:46] TheGiant99: @smashwow agree but it's not as high as people make out
[7:32:56] Padraigah: D4 needs to take a cue from POE and make their tmog work for every class rather than being class locked and then I might actually be tempted to buy something.
[7:32:59] SpreedyTV: r you not logging in with steam ??
[7:33:02] Madknox: @Yagr6 true but still better than D4 by miles
[7:33:11] smashwow: @TheGiant99 fair but look at the numbers now for d4 and the season just launched yeah?
[7:33:33] smashwow: that's my point blizz missed it by not having the ladder out of the box
[7:33:45] KingSlayerYotam: towHAMUP
