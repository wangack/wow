[0:47:18] Garrott2: hello Snutz and chat friends
[0:47:21] rollinsthechamp: @snutzy My plan was conflag and chaosbolt and then succubus charm ele curse then Incinerate>Immolate>Conflag then I got Immolate buff and then re-charm into a chaosbolt>Immolate>Shadowburn something like that but idk
[0:47:37] Stars69: tbh there really isnt too much to do
[0:48:00] Stars69: ya close
[0:48:21] jsantirayn: @rollinsthechamp imp for more damage with improved imp talent and void walker
[0:48:55] Stars69: up and to the right, there's a path on one of the sides
[0:49:04] jcurt03: Rollin ur overthinking it. While you do all that a boomkin is going to starsurge you twice and kill you, or a sp is gonna SW:D for 1.2k

[0:53:11] dj_efx: but a gain in pve due to starfall
[0:53:18] gamedemon010: its basically useless
[0:53:33] gamedemon010: going feral on my druid till they fix it
[0:53:45] xalu_24: what you been up to bro

[2:45:36] Stars69: its a defend farm and watch tv angle at 40
[2:46:23] Stars69: solo q, dont think you need ab exalted so it wont be TOO bad of a grind hopefully
[2:46:44] Stars69: gnomer is fun
[2:48:12] Blackimus_: are you running for xp or just the staff?

[2:55:41] Lmart97: in game audio acting up a lil
[2:57:37] buggzymalones: Id be curious to see around where it lands on a ranking list
[2:57:55] angrykittymeow: why u doing old raid?
[2:58:18] Featherfeeet: my favourite tune from the 2000's
[2:58:22] buggzymalones: I think it  would be pretty clear that destro would win out, I would personally love to find a decent aff build tho. It sucks running into any pvp while in a destro build.
[2:58:50] Miken: They killed boomie Sadge
[2:59:00] buggzymalones: dude shadow bolt volley up to 30 was so much fun
[2:59:00] Inzio: its not even the dmg nerf
[2:59:06] Miken: It crits for 600 now
[2:59:09] Inzio: you go oom after 1 fight pretty much @snutzy
[2:59:15] Miken: Starfire does 400dmg with the buff
[2:59:17] buggzymalones: well it was bugged before so
[2:59:19] Miken: Its unplayable
[2:59:25] angrykittymeow: what do u expect from blizzard :D
[2:59:43] plebTV: was 50% nerf, it was a 30% flat nerf and a 58% nerf to spellpower coefficient
[2:59:46] plebTV: wasnt*
[2:59:51] angrykittymeow: i feel like they lack good mathematicians
[2:59:57] exteps: they made bfd harder?? lol
[3:00:21] Miken: Best part is, eclipse rune is bugged for starfire and for knockback aswell, so in PVP u will never cast it out and u go out of mana giga fast
[3:00:43] ssourii: druid tears are yummy
[3:00:47] buggzymalones: hahaha
[3:01:19] Miken: It feels so fucking shit aswell, because balance was so bad whole phase 1, its kinda broken for few days in phase 2 and it gets insta nerfed to ground Sadge
[3:01:23] buggzymalones: I mean it wasnt really a nerf though, it was a bug fix...
[3:01:30] plebTV: ez solution..just make spells do different dmg to players
[3:01:46] buggzymalones: so we should be complaining that they allowed the bug to be in the game to where people invested a bunch of time making a broken class lol
[3:01:47] ssourii: @Miken balance was broken for the past like 6 weeks bro
[3:01:49] iconzerraa: 1800 starsurges, it was overtuned for sure
[3:01:52] plebTV: dont think their engine is designed to integrate that kinda shit tho lol
[3:02:09] aztelol: well my warrior wanted that sword xD
[3:02:26] yoitshesi: finally 40
[3:02:31] fanniclap: Druids were honestly the most annoying class rofl. But that's not a nerf that's death
[3:02:33] yoitshesi: only took all weekend
[3:03:04] yoitshesi: just got my mount, bout to try to farm some gold back lol
[3:03:07] ssourii: theyre still gonna be strong lol its just not gonna be brokenly unfair
[3:03:20] ssourii: they made their nuke damage come from harcasting instead of a spam insta
[3:03:41] buggzymalones: ^^ just like anyone elses nuke dmg lol
[3:03:45] ssourii: yerp
[3:03:47] Stars69: o7
[3:03:54] RottenBanana209: gg later
[3:03:58] ssourii: ggz
