[2:12:43] Yanoru: The thing here is, a lot of people were scared of bringing modern wow into classic with a lot of changes
[2:12:53] thebassdruid: hi towelie, are you doing hardcore  or regular SoM?

[2:20:13] PToastman: Johnny Five, alive?
[2:20:15] CrusaderNero: @NabJnov you get to do that, for free
[2:20:21] Zakali: @NabJnov  You can for free.
[2:20:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think Esfand is going to do it there

[2:21:22] CaptainJoeyNY: ironman mode does not appeal t me
[2:21:23] punpunisimo: @Towelliee when do you think 9.2 will be dropping?

[2:21:48] PToastman: Goldshire Inn on Classic is where the pros hang out
[2:21:49] Aquadriel: classic, seems like JAB was right Kappa
[2:21:52] McpoT: kinda the same model they use for D3 with the seasons
[2:21:58] falsecopyofsunder: What is a ripcord? I urban dictionary'd it and got interesting results 8)
[2:22:06] CrusaderNero: there are ppl playing classic era. im even in a guild that actually raids
[2:22:14] robertjordan83: @Towelliee disappointed that tbcc wasnt what you hoped? or its just whatever
[2:22:18] ohnot___her: It should be exactly like D3, after season is over toons should go regular and should be able to chose to bring it into TBC
[2:22:41] theSalute: lewt it rip !!!
[2:23:05] spencer36336: ur char looks like he wants to pee
[2:23:30] bigbambooski: they said there would be an option to movce to classic servers after SoM is over

[2:26:35] RunningOutOfRAM: @Lothawia my whole life is one big KEKW
[2:26:44] FerociouzMonk: hows demon hunter doing
[2:26:55] shmokindoink: Hype for SoM?
[2:26:56] TheHardcorian: Is it correct that its a 1% drop chance? LUL
[2:27:01] The_Mail_Man__: imfiredupDrip
[2:27:06] soundzGOOD: mount is not a guraanteed drop FeelsBadMan
[2:27:07] Lothawia: Yeah 1% chance lol
[2:27:15] valianya: Isn't it the game director 's job to decide both when to pull ripcord and that things should be held back for a ripcord pull?  I mean who was responsible for the idea to release systems that they know  need qol changes but deliberately  withhold those changes till later ?
[2:27:18] Dankmanarmy: Rare bosses are usually around 1%
[2:27:29] TheHardcorian: What idiot thought it was a good idea for a 1% chance for an anniversary event? KEKW
[2:27:31] Sajko33: I dont think its 1%
[2:27:34] wrhashwizard: where is the boss you have to kill?
[2:27:35] theoriginalzinng: @Towelliee hows your herman miller embody holding up after a year or so of having it?
[2:27:36] king_julian_96: the last event was deathwing mount
[2:27:42] reyvin40: rare only kyrians can summon
[2:27:46] Kromede: IonJam TheHardcorian
[2:27:53] king_julian_96: I love that mount
[2:27:55] Sajko33: Rocket is 1/2000
[2:28:15] sgtalash: and this is a 30 level only requirement
[2:28:25] sgtalash: rocket  is 50 level
[2:28:25] nikola: yea, but rocket is special becaues of that
[2:28:32] TheHardcorian: I see your point, but still think its bad thinking.
[2:28:36] Monkkey: towel are you EU?
[2:28:46] arzak: this patch is season 4?
[2:28:48] theoriginalzinng: thinking about getting one, might have to splurge
[2:28:53] nyare__: whats the name of the anniversary mount?
[2:28:58] king_julian_96: Didn’t we get the deathwing mount last anniversary
[2:29:29] reyvin40: yes
[2:29:43] TheHardcorian: You believe the hype that 10.0 will be this "big reset" in the Warcraft universe? I seen your clip about the future of wow being, "different".
[2:29:54] ZlayeN: @Towelliee did u hear the news? Blizzard will shut hes doors and all servers will go offline permanently
[2:29:57] Zocoe: Illidari Doomhawk
[2:30:09] RunningOutOfRAM: I have been leveling without the 17 % EXP BUFF WTF  I"M I RETARDED  (chat dont answer)
[2:30:18] Freddye: he knows
[2:30:26] nyare__: @Zocoe thanks its ugly as fuck
[2:30:33] kharditv: @sl4j3n towStop towIt
[2:30:35] TheHardcorian: I personally starting is Mists, it would be great to see a huge reset in terms of story, a light reboot.
[2:30:40] Kromede: New Classic 10.0 towPog
[2:30:42] valianya: The only other anniversary mount is corehound from completing Ragnaros anniversary content.  Rare drops from Ragnaros were made available in Xmas gift randomly
[2:30:45] DuploThief: 1 more calling tomorrow and i will fanilly have 80 renown on my main lol
[2:31:07] soundzGOOD: believe!!
[2:31:11] RunningOutOfRAM: @DuploThief I farm 80 renown in 2 days

[2:31:52] theNebuchadnezzar: more lfr?
[2:31:55] Blah206: lol
[2:32:00] Dankmanarmy: Do you think there's any chance we will have 10.0 reveal at game awards in december or will they announce it after the 9.2 raid cinematic? @Towelliee
[2:32:10] idenkaz_: and that's the why this will probably never happen lmao
[2:32:10] azzurrin: They just need instance apartment
[2:32:12] LegoCoin: housing is kind of a thing in all games now LOL
[2:32:15] Sollice: On what game has housing ever felt wrong?
[2:32:32] TheHardcorian: Patch in housing and set housing  accessories in the store, EZ. That will be Blizzards approach. Pessimistic I know.
[2:32:45] RunningOutOfRAM: @RunningOutOfRAM no it doesnt you spam torgast level 9 layer and bam you can get from 1 to 80 in a day
[2:32:47] Clicklesly: Well, Garrisons were basically housing...
[2:32:47] azzurrin: it has to be tired to power most likely LOL
[2:32:50] deadman385: I’ll give you something that feels right
[2:32:54] iblighters: It's the easiest win for them though
[2:33:08] TheHardcorian: Blizzard need to stop thinking whats suitable to their vision and what the players would enjoy, they arent the ones subbing and paying PrideShrug
[2:33:10] SpoonManes: housing is for interior designers, it doesnt add to game for me peronally
[2:33:20] Sollice: @Towelliee They definitly have the people to do it. How many did they bring in from VV in to Blizzard
[2:33:21] PokerFaceMoose: just do space housing like wildstar, instead of science we have magic
[2:33:33] RunningOutOfRAM: HAUSE  = Garrison 2.0 KEKW
[2:33:35] Waspire: arent you not tired of being a  killer hobo?
[2:33:43] TheHardcorian: ESO's approach to housing is the best, you can even put dungeon/raid heads in the houses with quest collectables.
[2:34:02] Clicklesly: Can't we just finally build dance studios instead Kappa
[2:34:05] BoiAtomico: towelliee senpai going strong in world of timegates
[2:34:08] king_julian_96: Yeah and then you will have the shit show of draenor garrisons all over again
[2:34:08] Teldrin89: my guess the engine is not capable to hold housing system
[2:34:12] LegoCoin: yeah I think housing might be a waste of time and $ at this point
[2:34:13] idenkaz_: housing cant be done in WoW because its not canon that your character even exist in the world. putting a house in the world would break canon for them Kappa right Ion, right.
[2:34:15] Sollice: I dont think anyone expects to BUILD their house manually
[2:34:17] TheHardcorian: The market for housing is crazy in mmo's people dedicate 100's of hours to it
[2:34:22] Sollice: cool but not what we have to have
[2:34:22] soundzGOOD: how about: the jailer reaches his goal and redefines reality, which means we get back to a point where everything we did so far resets, starting fresh, before stormwind and orgrimmar were built. thats where they introduce housing as we built the city for "the first time"
[2:34:23] Templexx: 100% how it should be done. incentive
[2:34:25] valianya: We cannot do housing, too busy assigning one person to make our cutscenes at lower quality than a fan hobbyist
[2:34:26] reyvin40: I would be happy with guild housing
[2:34:26] Blah206: castles PogChamp
[2:34:49] BoiAtomico: Water like never seen before?
[2:34:50] LegoCoin: Maybe they make a new game - Warcraft Housing LUL
[2:34:51] CaptainJoeyNY: Floating rock houses
[2:34:52] Templexx: 9.2 haha
[2:34:52] DeanoTV: KEKW
[2:34:54] im_n0t_jezus: LUL
[2:34:58] SpoonManes: wop wop wop walking on water
[2:35:05] Bassar94: this aint nagrand
[2:35:07] poptune: you wanna build nagrand?
[2:35:11] theSalute: rock water !
[2:35:12] kamikazis: you mean like malygos floating rocks?
[2:35:17] abbosss: hall of fame unlocks floating rocks Kappa
[2:35:20] Stragmol: player housing, but then the cities won't "feel" alive anymore..
[2:35:24] Miklagart: but didnt they want housing anymore where everybody is chilling in their own house. there would be nobody in the open world (cities) anymore
[2:35:25] Sollice: WATER WATER WATER.....YOUVE NEVER SEEN WATER LIKE THIS BEFORE towRee towRee towRee towRee towRee towRee towRee towRee towRee towRee towRee
[2:35:27] Alittlegeeky: mind blowing
[2:35:30] wildwittra: and a snail
[2:35:32] Greeneggplant: yep, nagrand neighborhoods
[2:35:57] Episodical: locks still not dong their jobs I see
[2:36:01] Episodical: doing*
[2:36:03] TheHardcorian: I'd love if the Jailer wins, Thanos snaps his fingers (because he is basically Thanos at this point) and we see flashbacks of all the expansions, and the very start of wow, then it cuts to a black screen. Do a Fortnite type of event, leave us in suspense for 10.0.
[2:36:03] reyvin40: I think housing should be dependent on the race.  example Dwarven houses underground
[2:36:05] Sollice: @Miklagart No one does that in FF.
[2:36:06] idenkaz_: stop KEKW
[2:36:09] CrusaderNero: OH SHUT UP
[2:36:10] king_julian_96: it’s like when that guy said that in the video he completely forgot about dks and shaamys being able to walk on water
[2:36:12] Sollice: So it can be done correctly
[2:36:13] Titosamson: haa
[2:36:15] PokerFaceMoose: towStop towIt
[2:36:17] robertjordan83: @Towelliee damn thats genius
[2:36:19] Stangin2122: I hope no housing comes..go back to your Garrison and enjoy it
[2:36:19] Fafnyir: What? You don't have phones?
[2:36:20] Bassar94: NEW CEO OF BLIZZARD RIGHT HERE
[2:36:24] DrWraithjr: LUL don't give them any ideas
[2:36:25] Templexx: didnt they confirm a warcraft mobile game? like in some stock meeting
[2:36:25] Demanisraar: NotLikeThis
[2:36:27] CrusaderNero: yes thats why you need to SHUT UP :P
[2:36:29] idenkaz_: it will happen, thats the problem KEKW

[2:36:31] Djfarmville: very scared
[2:36:33] curlytopcoffee: wow housing immortal
[2:36:36] Kyrioz: what time does the U.S get to do the 17th aniv event
[2:36:41] Miklagart: @Sollice but it happened with garrisons
[2:36:48] EllisTheMenace1: can't we just get WILDSTAR back please
[2:36:51] deadman385: @towelliee gone off the deep end
[2:36:51] BoiAtomico: by this point, they should just fire Ion and hire Preach KEKW
[2:36:51] TheHardcorian: World of StoreCraft, subscription required.
[2:36:58] valianya: Just pick a few buildings per city and make them instanced you see your own house when outside
[2:36:59] Alittlegeeky: and hey who knows, maybe Ion could make WoW more like animal crossing and we can do interior and exterior design too
[2:37:00] Sollice: Thats because they let you do TOO MUCH in terms of gathering and crafting in garrisons
[2:37:02] TheHardcorian: @TheAtomicRam I second that KEKW
[2:37:02] Valestrus: wow mobile game?
[2:37:05] Valestrus: what?
[2:37:07] RunningOutOfRAM: LOLI WOW GAME KEKW
[2:37:07] king_julian_96: What don’t you guys have phones
[2:37:07] pinoculus: in-store limited time furniture sets
[2:37:09] eakiller: loot boxes
[2:37:12] eakiller: ?
[2:37:14] Sollice: Just make WoW housing...a house you can buy and decorate things in
[2:37:21] Bassar94: my house gonna have a cosby suite in it
[2:37:30] SpoonManes: they shold make wow tokens a cryptocurrency and tie the game to the blockchain
[2:37:53] KillaPr0: or even state
[2:38:10] TheHardcorian: The jailer wins and forces us to work in our garrisons until 2023. That would be a great reason to kill him in the next raid after 9.2 KEKW
[2:38:19] Alittlegeeky: The sims 5: WoW edition
[2:38:27] valianya: Sunsong farms was almost player housing, but they didn't take it the last steps

[2:39:02] Djfarmville: and then multiboxers do a 51% attack

[2:42:07] CrusaderNero: its a good thing
[2:42:12] 위캔어퍼: do u think cross faction will be certainly done in 9.2 or next expansion?
[2:42:13] king_julian_96: What’s your thoughts of blizz time gating the final raid of shadowlands in 9.2 towelliee cause for me I’m pissed it means I can’t get 11/11 norm first week of raid
[2:42:23] CrusaderNero: for 99.9% of the players it doesnt matter either
[2:42:29] Getitonthelow: @towelliee you think star wars story is worth playing through?
[2:42:37] RunningOutOfRAM: KEKW
[2:42:39] death_cam_: wasnt the last time they kept a boss hidden with no knowledge raden in tot?
[2:42:48] death_cam_: was*
[2:43:09] idenkaz_: the sponsors gonna flip KEKW
[2:43:19] Polarisss_: I think they also need to not let EVERYONE have beta and it out for so long. feel like it kills the hype since you already know the content
[2:43:26] soundzGOOD: be WOTLK please @BLIZZARD
[2:43:26] CrusaderNero: literally everything is dataminded, tested and "done" long before launch. so its cool they do it like this now and again
[2:43:27] tebbix: YEP
[2:43:32] Ramdorpser: Instead they just release classic again. lol
[2:43:50] CrusaderNero: @Ramdorpser classic seasons is a requested feature sooooo...
[2:43:54] touchofpinkfizz: I much prefer WoW over FF
[2:44:05] MoonwalkingAngel: i hate going thru story in ff14 i just wanne kill shit
[2:44:12] Holysal: @Ramdorpser no issue. its a different team and ppl wanted it
[2:44:13] CrusaderNero: Tried FF, not my kind of MMORPG.
[2:44:14] dpung9119: Will you every return to GW2?
[2:44:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: what if they do a tbc classic season of mastery one day
[2:44:17] bruhSit_farmer: do you think they will bring back AP in 9.2 or 10.0 ?
[2:44:25] soundzGOOD: im not sure if a fun version of a game should take ressources when theres a retail MAIN game which needs HELP URGENTLY
[2:44:30] tebbix: People have short memory and thinks WoW has been bad all the time
[2:44:41] CrusaderNero: now Blizzard will force you to every quest from each xpac before doing newest content Kappa
[2:44:46] Djfarmville: @CrusaderNero it wont have any change...
[2:44:56] Hashmuff1n: For people who don't like western mmos wow is the only tab target option.
[2:44:56] bruhSit_farmer: will they bring back AP that is the question
[2:44:59] king_julian_96: Hjo1992 don’t even mention ap plz
[2:45:00] CrusaderNero: @Djfarmville theres some, and theres many more seasons to come.
[2:45:12] valianya: WoW has so much past content they could Evergreen with a min ilvl system
[2:45:31] Danfer17: Do you think they will stop timegating everything in the future?
[2:45:33] bruhSit_farmer: or an azerite equivalent
[2:45:55] Easymode: gotta grind our artifact power to power up our hearthstones to get back to azeroth after we're stranded next expansion Kappa
[2:46:13] Stangin2122: Seriously..why would an MMO ever not time gate the content.  It retaining players
[2:46:15] king_julian_96: What are the final fantasy raids like towelliee
[2:46:24] Danfer17: A good thing would be, if you decide to do an old raid with a full group, you get higher drop chance on mounts
[2:46:28] NennanPie: you can reduce your level and item level to level with friends
[2:46:37] Valtuex: Don't even need to do 10.0 make it a 9.2.5 patch to bridge the 2 year gap for 10.0
[2:46:46] ShoulderOfOrion: hey happy anniversary towels!  :D
[2:46:50] Stangin2122: exactly!!
[2:46:56] valianya: Since Legion they keep bringing back AP as a borrowed power system  every expansion, they need to stoppit
[2:46:59] bruhSit_farmer: bring corruption and azerite back !!
[2:47:02] Polarisss_: wtb mop cm gear account wide
[2:47:15] Miklagart: but when ff foes it its fine
[2:47:32] Holysal: the same ppl that dont want time gate will complain when they do all the content in a week
[2:47:33] Vivelli: its a matter of what is being timegated
[2:47:42] Maxoru0: Is this on normal?
[2:47:44] Hashmuff1n: ^
[2:47:50] BoiAtomico: Every MMO timegates, WoW exagerates with timegating. You can pace yourself in FFXIV or be done with it in a week, it's up to you. You can't pace yourself in WoW, they choose how much you advance per day/week, that is troublesome
[2:48:22] Hashmuff1n: truee
[2:48:23] Danfer17: True
[2:48:30] TheHardcorian: Are fury warriors still viable?
[2:48:32] king_julian_96: How quick do you think you will get to 60 in SOM
[2:48:32] Derelict80: iTS lfr\
[2:48:38] Valtuex: Time gating in the form of collection is fun (unlock this), time gating in the form of here is a 5 minute quest now wait a week is not.
[2:48:41] TheSteve: its not
[2:49:32] RunningOutOfRAM: @Baleroc1 wait like 10-20 more years and you will play classic classic
[2:50:21] Knocx: what no its regular quests on the ptr
[2:50:39] Zyxver: ýes its from regular quests too
[2:50:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the buff just said quests
[2:51:05] Hashmuff1n: Yeah from reg quests on ptr also
[2:51:10] Mecabeast: is this lfr nerzhul?
[2:51:17] king_julian_96: With faster leveling how long do you think it will take you towelliee to reach 60 on season of mastery
[2:51:21] Evolutious: it is only elite quests
[2:51:29] Knocx: also elite and dungeon quests
[2:51:32] Pubstar_LTD: dungeons and elite quests it says
[2:51:56] Shrenko: Im hyped for SoM aswell, theres just something about starting fresh on a classic server

[2:52:27] valianya: Time gating content for reasonable story progression isn't the same as stalling to draw out dead space to make it seem like there's more filler than there actually is.  Its the difference between Legion Nightfallen rebel questlines and the Broken Shore unlock questlines with Khadgar's jebait quests
[2:52:46] king_julian_96: do you think you can get to level 20 first day towelliee
[2:52:54] Shrenko: what class are you gonna play @Towelliee ?
[2:52:55] gold9871: +- 40 % faster maybe :)
[2:53:05] racketpunch: Which SoM server is Towelliee rolling on
[2:53:21] xenonpanda: like the people who played new world for 300+ hours then complained the game wasnt finished
[2:53:23] Miklagart: and then complain that there is nothing to do
[2:53:30] MadCowScurge: so many people in Tanaris it's insane
[2:54:16] joebafett_: FF story isn’t based on a calendar.

[2:54:18] Hashmuff1n: Lol you're playing the game too fast just sounds silly to me.
[2:54:20] Kromede: super time gated
[2:54:21] Mockle: get the what?
[2:54:29] mcgrady240: but at least its available to you and not sitting and waiting
[2:54:29] TheSteve: streamer im just repeating a buzzword stop being rational pls @Towelliee
[2:54:51] valianya: I'm saying its not always bad, but it can be especially frustrating to players if the payoff isn't worth the wait
[2:54:55] ThatsProto: I thought time gating was just prohibited achievements based on time, and not time + effort
[2:55:03] DeanoTV: truuu
[2:55:04] idenkaz_: normal average consumer doesnt have that time. get it done quick come back for new content. whats wrong with that?
[2:55:13] crashoverride_gaming: Wait so it’s like reading a book? I have to read page by page in order to understand the story and get the content? That is mind blowing
[2:55:15] grapyz: Imagine how unhealthy it would be for the harcore players if nothing was timegated.
[2:55:36] Aravarth: It's like an audience of gamers shouting, "It's MY MOUNT, and I WANT IT NOW!" Call JG GATEWORTH, 877-REEE-NOW
[2:55:37] Malkyr: Man the ilevel requirements in Stormblood felt so punishing. You had to grind through like 3 different sets of Tomestone gear and buy player crafted stuff to do all the raids.
[2:55:40] RunningOutOfRAM: 200 hours on day one and you do it all 24 > 200 Hm...
[2:56:01] Alacod: why every time I enter a WoW or FFXIV channel it's most often a WoW vs FFXIV convo happening ResidentSleeper
[2:56:05] Shrenko: a part of me want to setup the Russian server for Lost Ark 🤔
[2:56:09] im_n0t_jezus: LUL
[2:56:09] Pubstar_LTD: amen
[2:56:13] Buttscratchrr: towRee
[2:56:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: i did research Kappa
[2:56:22] maacckk_: auto confirmation bias
[2:56:27] luckfore: LUL
[2:56:28] DeanoTV: KEKW
[2:56:40] joe_g_433: Lol
[2:56:41] Mockle: my data: trust me bro!
[2:56:41] Nosdunk24: @Towelliee will you be playing alliance or horde for SoM?
[2:56:45] Wildside1177: Blizzard has 17 years of marketing and sales data from WoW plus all the data from their other assets. We have....opinions.
[2:56:47] DrWraithjr: LUL are you saying that people talking trash on the internet aren't always true? How dare you
[2:56:49] CaptainJoeyNY: perception is reality right?
[2:56:59] bladdes_00: Bellular had solid data for wow recently :P
[2:57:02] Wolfzlol: is coming back to WoW worth right now?
[2:57:02] Okri24: and they leave out they are on an extremely low pop server
[2:57:09] sarkastik_: What's that addon?
[2:57:13] subversv: go to torghast they will be waiting for u
[2:57:20] cudlsac: so what in 9.2 are you looking forward to? just wondering cause nothing I saw got me excited about coming back.
[2:57:22] SinicalDev: @Wolfzlol Depends how you attribute worth, I'm enjoying coming back since 9.0 personally
[2:57:24] NinjaGlovz: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:57:26] Puurre: everyone has left wow and its dead because my 4 friends on my friends lists stop playing LUL @Towelliee
[2:57:26] Huntauren: AngelThump
[2:57:26] axellent_x: We all know how well blizz utilizes their data Kappa
[2:57:36] Maxoru0: It was the reward system, is the reason why I quit, not so much the time gating. They would be a dead game a long time ago, if it weren't for time gated systems lol.
[2:57:36] idenkaz_: i mean most ppl do work 8 hours a day and have other thing to do right? its not like playing the game for a living is the norm. you dont need data for that. jesus christ
[2:57:38] crowel: they are sitting in torghast waiting for you if they are unlocked
[2:57:40] Rexialiton: @Wolfzlol imo, yes
[2:57:49] CaptainJoeyNY: Blizz needs to rebalance the BC servers. Herod is 99.5% horde now. there are like 15 inactive accounts for the alliance on there
[2:57:51] Alacod: so how bout that crossplay?
[2:58:04] Wolfzlol: Thanks guys!
[2:58:16] EdgeoftheBladez: Towlliee spill the beans on 10.0 come on man don't hold out on us
[2:58:17] Malkyr: Yeeeeees please all I want from 10.0 is crossfaction
[2:58:19] Okri24: need Gnome and Gobo paladins
[2:58:24] king_julian_96: Yes every mmo does time gating but time gating the final raid of shadowlands come on I think that was dumb
[2:58:34] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: You do
[2:58:40] Radtvlol: cross faction feels so wrong
[2:58:43] RunningOutOfRAM: WHENRE ARE YOU STATISTIC S WHERE ARE THEY ?
[2:58:50] RunningOutOfRAM: :D
[2:58:58] SinicalDev: @king_julian_96 it's 1 week for 3 bosses, who cares - the mythic race will be after the 'gating' ends
[2:59:07] Zakali: Easy with the capslock my man ^^
[2:59:18] Vivelli: like corruption resistance from nzoth?
[2:59:20] Tomaterrs: are there any groups doing mythic raiding without any addons for challenge?
[2:59:28] Mecabeast: faction systems where you can't play pve with the other faction(s) seems dated in this day and age
[2:59:29] Alacod: @RADtvlol why?
[2:59:30] lumaday: the domination magic resistance maybe
[2:59:39] Stangin2122: @magemyway..LOL.  I want to be heard because I'm right.  LOL
[3:00:01] cudlsac: I miss class specific legendaries I don't really care for these welfare ones everyone gets.
[3:00:03] Vivelli: o soft enrage to being MC'd for the fight lol
[3:00:06] Vivelli: a*
[3:00:15] stjon13: or the last 3 bosses are in Azeroth?
[3:00:24] Draecco: @cuddlsac agree
[3:00:24] ambatukek: so their cinematics make sense also an argument LUL
[3:00:27] Radtvlol: @alacod orcs in stormwind just don't seem right
[3:00:38] Malkyr: 90% of guild wont even clear Heroic first 8 week 1
[3:00:43] iblighters: doing that in the raid for story is fine. Like who does it impact really? The top guilds in the world? I bet they don't care.
[3:00:44] joe_g_433: How many people are actually going to clear first 8 the first week anyway? Like 2 or 3% of players will be hurt by the first week. Idk  doesn’t seem that bad to me.
[3:00:49] CaptainJoeyNY: @Towelliee whats the pink circle on your cursor?
[3:00:54] Maxoru0: A week is not bad though, to time gate a raid lol
[3:00:56] MosesBun: didnt they legit already said they are doing it for cringe story reasons
[3:00:58] TheHardcorian: They probably saw the feedback on cinematics and woeful story so they are timegating it to inject 10 cinematics LUL
[3:01:20] Maxoru0: @TheHardcorian LUL
[3:01:34] Zyxver: For ppl that dont understand the season of mastery buff look at the wording of the buff. Quest experience increased by 40%. Dungeon and elite quests grant bonus experience, this means that you get 40% from regular quest and even more exp for elite and dungeon quest, and if you dont believe me, do a quest on the classic era and then do it again on SoM beta and you see that u get more exp from regular quest
[3:01:45] Mr_Moo5e: we give anduin his compass back and he leads us to the black pearl

[3:02:02] BoiAtomico: it's the real real real end
[3:02:08] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: COPIUM
[3:02:12] Radtvlol: COPIUM
[3:02:15] Vivelli: if this is the end of the saga, there better be some BFA quality of cinematics on it
[3:02:18] TheHardcorian: For sure will make or break the communitys trust going forward, if its space shit i'm out KEKW
[3:02:31] BoiAtomico: except it's the end by the 3rd or 4th time now?
[3:02:45] Radtvlol: Awakenings Kappa
[3:02:52] Alacod: @RADtvlol They work together already?, So saving the world is cool but when thats done you just randomly hate each other again?
[3:02:52] ReaVaeR_: wuttt spanish add? LUL
[3:02:59] ReaVaeR_: ad*
[3:03:05] Rexialiton: im excited about 10.0
[3:03:05] BRUTALIT0PS: I can not catch a fucking break in Lula's FF league this year
[3:03:05] Padarius: Padarius subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! don't me me, just passing thru
[3:03:08] HaloS23: @Towelliee you did say 10.0 was going to be different!
[3:03:28] Aravarth: TBC, Legion... uhh that's it lol
[3:03:30] Zakali: pandaria was not space!
[3:03:33] Godrick85: Mop wasnt space shit...
[3:03:33] NinjaGlovz: towLets towGo SPACE SHIT
[3:03:33] Demanisraar: WOD KEKW
[3:03:33] joe_g_433: @towelliee do you think we get 10.0 at a somewhat regular time? Like in a year?
[3:03:35] adubwest: wow worth getting again? haven't played in 12 year
[3:03:36] Miklagart: wotlk was sick space
[3:03:42] CaptainJoeyNY: Space shit was dope
[3:03:48] stjon13: we still haven't seen Varian Wrynn in Shadowlands
[3:03:50] LolitaAldea: because they have a shit ton of content
[3:03:55] davysaurus: @Towelliee it was all a dream - N'zoth won and get woken up by Hogger to return to t he fight in space.
[3:03:57] Draecco: Final boss for 10.0 is going to be kel’thuzad Kappa
[3:04:03] ninetynil: SoO was not space shit Kappa
[3:04:05] racketpunch: Wrath and MoP over those two
[3:04:05] Radtvlol: @alacod I guess from a lore perspective it can work sure and I think it will happen. but still seems wrong to me lol
[3:04:08] EdgeoftheBladez: ya but we are tired of it tho. Space shit every other expac would be cool. but now its like every one
[3:04:11] Shrenko: fuck housing lets get a spaceship instead
[3:04:12] MosesBun: @stjon13 you wont see him his soul got turned to dust from guldan
[3:04:13] Dalaness: An expansion where all the old gods get released could be fun
[3:04:16] Demanisraar: @stjon13 he's not there.. he got deleted
[3:04:29] cudlsac: wod was more time traveling
[3:04:41] dutkus92: dutkus92 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:04:41] mrz_as: i think it's going to be alliance civil war
[3:04:45] Armdel: it was pretty grounded aside from the inclusion of the legion wasnt it
[3:04:46] Radtvlol: SWT OMEGALUL R
[3:04:56] Zakali: Gief Old Gods expansion
[3:04:57] TheHardcorian: @Dalaness Nzoth was an old god that a 40 man raid defeated LUL they have no power
[3:05:05] Zakali: Like where they all get reborn or whatever
[3:05:05] cudlsac: and I don't feel like BC was space
[3:05:29] Demanisraar: Turalyon is going to be the mad religious freak
[3:05:42] Easymode: #NotMyKing Kappa
[3:05:55] Maxoru0: he's going to have some serious trust issues going forward.
[3:05:56] cudlsac: you went through a portal in BC you didn't get to it by traveling through space.
[3:06:02] Mr_Moo5e: Turalyon, Scarlet Crusade 2.0
[3:06:10] HaloS23: and hes going to oust the NEs due to Illidan killing the prime naru
[3:06:12] TheHardcorian: Shadowlands at this point, im not convinced they knew what direction they were taking the game at all, it just seems to messy and disconnected from patch to patch.
[3:06:15] Stangin2122: #HouseofWrynn
[3:06:16] Dalaness: Yrel comes through the dark portal and goes haywire
[3:06:26] Roaringkittylol: Turalyon, Scarlet Crusade should be a faction! I'd join!
[3:06:28] Todmeister9000: @cuddlsac it is literally on another planet LUL
[3:06:32] Shrenko: AYAYA
[3:06:35] Linasha: is it exciting tho? There was nothing about the preview that has me at all hype to come back.
[3:06:39] ReaVaeR_: a world with never seen water Kappa
[3:06:44] cudlsac: that's not space that's another planet
[3:06:44] Alacod: @RADtvlol It will be a nice narrative to set aside their prejudice for a better future especially since they do it already. lately the faction violence towards each other seems so forced.
[3:06:45] valianya: Maybe another Old God spore will crash into Azeroth from where its been floating in space ejected from some wholly old god corrupted planet, have a real Black Empire to fight against
[3:06:47] Aervyper: @Towelliee going to go back to Warcraft 1 so they can repeat content for the next 20 years over and over and over until we are all dead
[3:06:48] realnzall: Man, it is fun to finally have a competent guild to raid with. Relied on PuGs and streamer groups for 12 years with all the misery that entails. Joined a Mythic guild as a casual for the HC fun runs and it's really fun to finish the raids
[3:06:50] Coldfire989: Azeroth 432
[3:06:50] dutkus92: can we just go back to fighting big ass dragons?
[3:06:59] bladdes_00: no blizzcon this time.. so no expansion in 2022 :P
[3:07:00] cudlsac: you do zero space travel in BC
[3:07:00] Radtvlol: deathwing again
[3:07:01] valianya: Azshara too
[3:07:01] Linasha: Linasha subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:07:04] BoiAtomico: @Towelliee they said at the start that the time in the shadowlands passes differently, so it could be 1000 years after in Azeroth in the next expac
[3:07:06] JoeyBagadonuts: we come back, alliance is destroyed and horde rules the world
[3:07:11] Bosweny: more tentacles wooo
[3:07:14] Demanisraar: Jailor will thanos snap us back to classic wow and we all start over Kappa
[3:07:16] Munz13: possibility of a mini raid in 9.2.5 ala crucible of storms leading up to a 10.0 storyline?
[3:07:19] Mr_Moo5e: turalyon leads the next scarlet crusade, determines anduin is corrupted, big fight
[3:07:30] flebbooo: Xaltatha
[3:07:33] Dalaness: x-lady
[3:07:39] Aravarth: Xal'tatha?
[3:07:40] flebbooo: Xalath* or something LUL
[3:07:44] mrz_as: and light invasion from draenor to support  turalyon
[3:07:46] Maxoru0: I kind of hope Jailer gets what he wants lol
[3:07:47] Aravarth: Xalalolololol
[3:08:09] r0b928: I’m glad you’re playing WoW again towelliee. How do you feel about it?

[4:21:37] Jimbobaus: my series X is connected, but never used it since i got it launch day.... Keeping it for Bethesda games basically @Towelliee
[4:21:38] freetherocktv: @Towelliee HALO 5 is Xbox only
[4:21:38] CaptJack68: Series X would be better than my Series S
[4:21:39] YFNSpider: @Shrenko But why, when releasing it on the Halo anniversary like they're already planning to would make way more sense?
[4:21:40] FranciscoTheMage: unfortunately because of head shake or whatever i can never play HALO.. the game as much i love it makes me physically nautious for some reason
[4:21:42] xluckydawgx: Halo was supposed to release today but the campaign delayed it, so the rumor is that the MP will get shadow dropped today
[4:21:42] Mecabeast: w.e happened to consoles and controllers having print runs of the transparent plastic
[4:21:52] rohdey: wtf why your closet so dusty Kappa

[4:22:07] elwingk: !wow
[4:22:07] Moobot: @elwingk Towelliee is not playing WoW for the time being. Maybe sometime in the future until then, FFXIV, SWTOR, Battlefield 2042 and New World will be holding us over.
[4:22:07] NickLeonhearth: master chief collection no?
[4:22:08] Kay_8k: halo 5 isnt on pc
[4:22:15] stagpul: I doubt it
[4:22:18] Shrenko: @YFNSpider campaign releases in December I think, multiplayer today
[4:22:19] TaNGoIX: They are different games

[4:22:24] FranciscoTheMage: little know fact .. DUST --> is actually dead decomposing hair and skin
[4:22:29] Colt_Engineer: infinite
[4:22:29] rreaks: @TaNGoIX halo infinite IS on PC dude.....
[4:22:30] TaNGoIX: Halo Infinite = Halo 6
[4:22:33] Shrenko: @YFNSpider most likely!
[4:22:34] Colt_Engineer: 5 came out years ago
[4:22:35] MicNoobs: new game = halo infinite

[4:23:21] jamarky23: I do believe it is dropping today. Insiders and even some devs hinted at it
[4:23:25] Mecabeast: halo infinite campaign $60 multi-player is free

[5:27:26] GameingAspect: twich drops only for partners?
[5:27:29] TheRandomoGuy: what's the take on wow boosting ?
[5:27:39] Short_Film: Imagine if WoW did drops
[5:27:39] Squirrel_nutty: to the vindicar! to the wall!
[5:27:48] s7wede: New World needs to keep getting fixed and get better so it can be real competition to World of Warcraft. Nothing will improve wow more than a real competitor
[5:27:49] N3llee: TLDR Overwolf has added new restrictions for Curseforge and its API. They will no longer allow 3rd party  Addon Managers to use their API. They are discontinuing any and all programs that allowed
[5:27:52] thecynicalshuffler: plenty of people saying to not like new world.. maybe not you... lol i dont hate but a lot of people do
[5:27:56] N3llee: They will deprecate the current API and create a new API where downloads do not count towards the CurseForge Reward Program—essentially splitting the community by turning addon developers against third-party addon managers. In addition, they will rate limit third-party addon managers if one becomes too popular oh, and not all addons will be available over the API.
[5:28:12] Zeuzo: @lh2301  Huntard
[5:28:15] themonkoffunk77: why are you playing wow?

[5:28:31] yulelogged: @lh2301 what are you interested in? casting? melee? healing? tanking?
[5:28:31] TweakT: New world shouldnt have released a broken game in the first place
[5:28:51] RealSolaroid: Wishing a games death every time a new MMO comes out is the weirdest thing honestly. Just play the game you wanna play
[5:28:52] Rabbi19: why cant ppl just enjoy games for what they are
[5:28:53] Astaris: Don't worry, Blizzard will sink wow in it's own time sadly
[5:28:53] TweakT: greedians still dont understand how to make mmos successful in 2021
[5:29:19] themonkoffunk77: only asking bc towellie made a big deal about never supporting the game again. wasnt sure what changed
[5:29:19] Meowzamere: catJAM Clap  agreed
[5:29:30] Blah206: amen <3
[5:29:33] ARROOCE: @Astaris People said this since classic and SL was still the fastest selling game in history
[5:29:34] Gingerprimer: WOWs real mmo competition is FFXIV. But wow is nowdays more competing vs tons of diffrent games rathern than just mmos
[5:29:36] flebbooo: big true
[5:29:36] Squirrel_nutty: stream died
[5:29:37] GameingAspect: play games enjoy the games
[5:29:39] N3llee: I want to play New World the bugs are just to much
[5:29:46] ViljoBenzo: The history in WoW is so long and we all got so many nice memories around it so i think none of MMOS will "kill" WoW ever @Towelliee
[5:29:53] TweakT: classic wow is still unbeaten lol
[5:29:54] Eraste: i played WoW hoping it'd be a WoW killer Kappa

[5:30:09] Thoreya: i used to play a lot of maplestory and OSRS before WoW
[5:30:22] LordJeffers: @Towelliee you've never been so right dude. 100%
[5:30:24] FluffyRampage69: I like new world. Its fun.  Wish there weren’t that many bugs. But it can get batter
[5:30:26] juicejacoby: Wildstar was good af @Volly
[5:30:27] CardinalTX: WoW is already following in Everquest's foot steps. Keep re-releasing classic progression. How long before tokens on classic servers?
[5:30:27] yulelogged: @lh2301 do you like summoning pets, or having pets? if so maybe hunter or warlock, hunter is a good class for a newer player plus you can collect pets
[5:30:28] Squirrel_nutty: why twitch gotta be twitching?
[5:30:28] ARROOCE: the fact that people think like that just shows how huge WoW is LULW
[5:30:30] gidgeet: I've been playing new World despite the bugs and early lag issues, I enjoy the crafting and gathering so much.
[5:30:33] dirk_diggler0: That's good vibes right there! play what makes you happy. not whats trending...
[5:30:40] Scoodles91: only wow can kill wow

[5:30:50] palasuun: You mean you guys aren't actively hoping WoW dies and we can all be freed from our addiction cold turkey?
[5:30:55] dmv_luke: what can you get from the doomwalker\
[5:30:55] miriones: why so many ppl want WoAW to die?
[5:30:56] Zeuzo: @Towelliee  ppl just Want to belive that someday ...an MMO will be better than wow and give them the same experience that wow did in the days!
[5:30:57] LSBreed: it's okay to enjoy what you enjoy
[5:30:58] Rexialiton: It is a daily
[5:31:02] 2scrubbie: Some people just weren't hugged enough as a child....
[5:31:02] GameingAspect: its a daily quets?
[5:31:02] yulelogged: @lh2301 rogue and warrior are good melee specs as well that are fun, same with paladin which kind of has a good mix of casting and melee
[5:31:03] akia03: still waiting on palia to release
[5:31:04] shinta__: it is daily
[5:31:19] BrutalHermit: Hell I still play GW2. Not a dead came but def not "trending" LUL
[5:31:23] CardinalTX: @Zeuzo Truth!
[5:31:45] Spoopyfoop: Why would you want WoW to die? Listen, I've enjoyed playing Wow for a VERY long time and my thought process on the whole Wow situation is to hope that the game will eventually recover and NOT die off... People who want Wow to die are just imo show the community exactly how toxic of a person they really are!
[5:31:46] Biotechz: @Towelliee what's the client you're using there to update your addons?
[5:31:50] Sollice: Ahh shit I was on a work call and I saw him watching something about OUtriders...Why?
[5:31:51] MoonwalkingAngel: ppl stil play everquest so ya
[5:31:54] yulelogged: i miss wildstar

[5:32:48] TweakT: nothing comes close
[5:32:49] ShowDUH: Imma be curious to see how the future Riot MMO will turn out it's going to be interesting for sure
[5:32:54] TodaysTheDayEh: PepeLaugh
[5:32:54] s7wede: You are looking at competition from the players perspective which doesn't work. Look at it from a dev perspective. MMO's should be constantly evolving to try and one up each other. Competition spurs creativity
[5:32:55] Eraste: yea, my best WoW friends I met during TBC on a dead server
[5:33:00] cosmothug: @Towelliee seems like crossfaction raiding is inevitable at this point. prolly dungeons and BGs too

[5:35:34] cosmothug: @gravess_66 that was probably the point, build up lore for MMO
[5:36:06] Molvonos: Jigganormous, my new favorite word.
[5:36:13] TweakT: they should create an mmorpg with the sole goal of killing wow
[5:36:23] Thoreya: wow needs more casual content that doesnt revolve around player power
[5:36:24] TweakT: maybe then will they make good games

[5:59:33] wreckshoptv: im using wowup
[5:59:40] luckfore: yea curseforge
[5:59:44] sharpps: @ormenlange123 wowup will have the same issue
[5:59:45] zPossum: just use wowup
[5:59:52] Molvonos: Overwolf can eat my whole ass.
[5:59:55] wreckshoptv: @ormenlange123 ah damn
[6:00:00] sharpps: WoWup also uses the same API so
[6:00:06] ItsGlime: @Molvonos can I also?
[6:00:06] theawesomestshow: yea basically curse is just restricting their addons is all sounds like
[6:00:11] Molvonos: @ItsGlime Sure
[6:00:12] valianya: Can you still just manually update addons?
[6:00:14] crawcook: It's a manager, not the api directly, so I guess no?
[6:00:17] UmmNoU: PogChamp
[6:00:18] Kinghorn: PogChamp
[6:00:18] lilwaldo: PogChamp
[6:00:21] Mecabeast: overwolf owns the rights to curseforges apis  so they are monopolizing the site
[6:00:37] Brendo____: can we see what the mount looks like?
[6:00:37] legendeur: it also fits the tmog PogChamp
[6:00:39] luckfore: wowup will be disabled too
[6:00:39] Rubbadubdub418: just saw a guy get the mount on stormrage
[6:00:58] theegoomba: if creators wanna put their addon on curse theyll have to agree to not upload it anywhere else is the thinking
[6:01:07] sharpps: @crawcook You're just saying something random here. Wowup and other managers load in the curseforge API so
[6:01:12] Meliea_EU: no need too use overwolf bloat, wowup is fine for addons
[6:01:13] Sulm: addon authors just have to switch to a different website for uploading their addons
[6:01:19] maraz909: It is free, if they would charge for using it then blizz would intervene for sure
[6:01:21] SinicalDev: theres no monopoly, its just that addon devs have to upload to curseforge and github, which most authors dont do
[6:01:23] N3llee: @Towelliee thats what I was talking about
[6:01:26] N3llee: it impacts everyone
[6:01:27] AndwariTV: i use wowup
[6:01:35] Meliea_EU: yea wowup works just fine
[6:01:35] luckfore: they added a bunch of ads to the app
[6:01:35] N3llee: I use WoWUp
[6:01:36] EllisTheMenace1: wowup is goood
[6:01:43] CoffeeDMG: wowup is one of the 3rdparty uses that will be hurt by this
[6:01:47] DuploThief: wowup for the win
[6:01:47] N3llee: but its about to be all over
[6:01:50] bapele45: if u change to wowup do you have to delete all of the addons from curseforge?
[6:01:51] Purivier: did i one shot the mount or did mount drops for everyone ?
[6:01:52] Meliea_EU: and wowup is no bloat
[6:01:56] Dark_Kornax: Imagine not having moved to wowup.io like a year ago
[6:01:58] DuploThief: @bapele45 nope
[6:02:02] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[6:02:17] Blackminuz: curseforge bad?
[6:02:22] Sphexator: If ya can't make a manager just as good as the others, exclude em from the API to force people on your inferior manager Kappa
[6:02:27] NashMarco: cant wait for blizzard to intervine and  put addons up for sale on the blizzstore
[6:02:28] mandilozano: lol
[6:02:43] N3llee: @Towelliee Curse offered devs reward perks and incentive to have top rated addons Overwolf is taking all of that away. No more money, rewards or perks
[6:02:44] BlindFaithFuel: serves him right for torturing us noobs in BC
[6:02:47] CoffeeDMG: boss pinata
[6:02:48] crawcook: @sharpps yes, I phrased in weirdly, I was thinking Blizzard won't care because it doesn't affect the TOS directly.
[6:02:48] Moose_Ka: Wait what? Why wouldnt wow addon devs upload to github? How else do they version control?
[6:02:51] akia03: well nobody touched him in tbc
[6:02:58] Molvonos: welp, just got the 2-handed axe on my DK.
[6:03:01] Meliea_EU: @NashMarco like bethesda? ^^
[6:03:04] SinicalDev: Yeah, I don't like Overwolf - but WoWUp etc. downloading from their servers incurs a cost to them, so makes sense they'd take it down
[6:03:05] Samurai3434: He's been degraded to Punching Bag status
[6:03:21] Cryogenic77: wowup will just lose access to curseforge servers but wowup has builtin multi access to other libraries like git and such. Overall wowup will still work the same, most devs upload to more than just curseforge.
[6:03:27] Mecabeast: the reason I went wowup was light weight great interface with no ads whereas I heard overwolfs application was heavy and had ads
[6:03:41] Moose_Ka: Scrabble >>> Monopolyy
[6:03:49] N3llee: If a Addon Dev wants to use Overwolf they have to sign thing saying they wont post their addon to any other site or share it through any other means.
[6:03:52] DuploThief: why am i getting a nerf fortnite add lol
[6:04:07] crawcook: yeah overwolf is a for profit company that is why they are pushing ads.
[6:04:09] Moose_Ka: @N3llee Thats so weird. I guess that makes sense why they dont upload to github
[6:04:23] N3llee: this doent just impact ow. It impacts tons of games. Minecraft for one
[6:04:27] Meliea_EU: there is another lightweight addon updater, ajour but its not better compared to wowup
[6:04:32] michaelmm: Overwolf are creating a new public API and WowUP devs have requested access.
[6:04:39] Molvonos: All his original gear, but upgraded.
[6:04:52] Inthezonewow: @Towelliee The Rarity string that was linked does not track kills
[6:04:54] N3llee: @Meliea_EU read mmo champ. Ajour is done as well
[6:04:59] michaelmm: Individual Addon authors can choose if they want their addon to be available through the new API.
[6:05:01] Inriden: All the 3rd party apps using curseforge download servers will be able to apply for a key to download from the servers.
[6:05:23] vocalpenguin: what level do u need to be to kill doomwalker
[6:05:23] Thoreya: pog
[6:05:40] luckfore: POGGERS
[6:05:41] N3llee: @Towelliee wowhead has a public "road map" that they gave to addon devs if you wanted to check out the details.
[6:05:46] Meliea_EU: @N3llee thx did not know that, hope wowup keeps going
[6:05:53] Kinghorn: 30 for reward chances vocalpenguin
[6:05:54] ItsGlime: whats season of mastery
[6:06:01] N3llee: @Meliea_EU chances are no addon manager will. get ready
[6:06:03] theawesomestshow: its literally gonna be Mages warriors and rogues
[6:06:05] vocalpenguin: @Kinghorn ty
[6:06:07] Taevenx: Just got the mount, toy and axe... does that mean I'm done now?

[6:06:15] Blueduck89: Just got the doomhawk
[6:06:20] Hazmatiq: What is season of mastery?
[6:06:24] Kinghorn: RIGGED
[6:06:26] SinicalDev: XP boost makes sense because its a compressed timeline of 12 months instead of 18months
[6:06:26] Taevenx: 100% :D
