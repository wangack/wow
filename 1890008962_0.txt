[1:04:11] hiitsmeguy: @muddelito details cant capture the dmg evoker adds to other ppl so it looks terrible there
[1:04:12] harmless52: @HeavyWavez every tpg and mdi is 99% the same comps
[1:04:44] theslinny: @agressietv TGP is notorious for having a lower quality cause they constantly have 4 streams open. But it is as good as it gets
[1:04:46] HeavyWavez: @harmless52 still dissapointed hahaha
[1:04:49] GuardMoony: last minute also had one
[1:04:55] AUTiger0325: Hey spectators, Why is Echo and Y on the screen 100% of the time when Last Minute has been fastest all day?
[1:05:01] Ellietools: If Critcake was a cake, what type of cake would Critcake be?
[1:05:07] Shearin77: yeah don't get tricked LUL
[1:05:08] Moobot: Check out the Raider.io highlights! https://raider.io/mdi
[1:05:12] Nylothar: @HeavyWavez it's overwhelmingly the best comp...like not even close...it's the most powerful the meta has ever been
[1:05:13] Ryssplays: echo just chillin atm
[1:05:18] Torqez: @AUTiger0325 Fan favourites
[1:05:21] saeron93: @AUTiger0325 all day of 45 min?
[1:05:23] Sebleh: Lmao Did blizz really get so mad at no healer keys that they need two healers for a 25 now? That preservation evoker isn’t even doing tank damage.
[1:05:24] harmless52: @AUTiger0325 cause echo is the big name in europe and y is the big name in china
[1:05:26] morZaw: @AUTiger0325 my guess would b so that people dont spam "Where is echo" is echo playing
[1:05:28] wizardxc: Hey spectators, Why is Echo and Y on the screen 100% of the time when Last Minute has been fastest all day?
[1:05:35] grommey_: Hey spectators, Why is Echo and Y on the screen 100% of the time when Last Minute has been fastest all day?
[1:05:36] agressietv: @theslinny Alright, I was wondering why quality was that low but makes sense, t
[1:05:37] Shearin77: echo will turn it up when they need to
[1:05:38] TANENOS: the hate to ECHO is real XD hope they win

[1:08:03] Rogastik: @hiitsmeguy the game is too complex to balance that perfectly, you'd lose some of that complexity and fun actually playing the game just for esports, however current best comp is way too ahead of other comps and needs nerfs for sure
[1:08:04] Severte: show last minute they already on +30
[1:08:08] meteorhill: director slept
[1:08:10] CherylK1972: What he’s speaking about has nothing to do with showing ALL TEAMS. Not just their faves.
[1:08:14] orcahontas: @UchicaItachi1 9 rogues 1 healer, entire enemy in cc for the entire bg, sound cool to me
[1:08:14] business_man_alex: This comp in particular is jus5 uber degenerate
[1:08:20] ModeraYsera: @BeyondBright ooo, fabled wafflecat
[1:08:26] Kritex: the fact that their all running the same comps, tells me exactly what i need to know about retail at this point. Theres still no versatility in this game. Meta has been said 67 times in the last 2 minutes.
[1:08:51] headlocks000: @Kritex this is a "speedrunning" meta. any spec is fine if youre just doing 20s with the bros
[1:09:08] moderatygos: this is a high push meta
[1:09:09] dumbdrummer: @Kritex its literally a competetion why would you play anything other than the best comp
[1:09:30] Tickticktack1: @headlocks000 mage stats is haste vers so what do you mean?
[1:09:31] Torqez: @Kritex At this level, which you're probably unfamiliar with, if there's even a comp that gives 5% advantage - these guys'll use it
[1:09:32] BizBichou: VIBE finally meeix casting time
[1:09:34] moderatygos: this is also a competition, players will want to min/max to win, which is why you see less variety
[1:09:35] Kritex: It makes what difference. The best comp cant be versatile is what im getting at.
[1:09:37] Sebleh: @kritex wdym there’s totally versatility in the game my Druid has like 8% versatility with the versatility flask
[1:09:45] flookguy: Came in wanting sheesh and echo to win but if All Good rolls monk all weekend I’m gonna be ALL IN on ALL GOOD

[1:09:56] aanti: what was the previous loot on 25?
[1:09:57] tesch384: bro last minute is NUTS
[1:09:58] headlocks000: @headlocks000 I mean its the meta for speedrunning and pushing max keys
[1:10:01] Vendethtv: The Exodia Comp dominating @Warcraft
[1:10:10] Rogastik: Also for live high keys last season you could run so many different classes and comps, balance was amazing S1 DF, its just most recent patch aug evoker broke the game a bit

[1:19:00] headlocks000: @Kayonee01 this comp isnt based on what season it is
[1:19:07] ModeraYsera: @Tickticktack1 what did we learn? StillWaiting
[1:19:11] Sebleh: If Wildi has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has only one fan then that is me. If Wildi has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Wildi, then I am against the world.
[1:19:14] Cheatin: Echo have echo route in Nelt ofc they dont want to show it early in the evening :D
[1:19:17] jannieglass: @Hazard at least in prev there was SOME tho.. this ssn theres NONE. its the same comp every run in every group. inot even SL was that bad where you used the same comp in every dungeon..
[1:19:31] ArnesMeyer: Lets see this broken chains in neltharus
[1:19:31] headlocks000: @Hazard Kappa
[1:19:48] harmless52: @jannieglass different comps wouldn't make it more exciting

[1:20:53] kimohunt: @Torqez you can go to the streamer's stream and there you can watch the team
[1:20:53] Ultratoasted: What profession?
[1:20:55] jannieglass: @Bekindorplink who said i was crying LUL its an observation
[1:21:01] Laptican: @requzzx When it actually need nerfs

[1:21:20] mazllli: halls of confusion, never knowing to go left or right
[1:21:31] Dez747: Lol the GDruids health just isnt moving... so boring
[1:21:41] BizBichou: blizzard should probably buff augvoker considering they do so little damage on the meters
[1:21:45] jannieglass: @Zirkx94 funny. changed the tank and suddenly DIVERSITY lol
[1:21:50] phodi: @Dez747 first time?
[1:21:55] Kelthiz: @Dez747 +22 btw KEKW
[1:21:58] kimohunt: @kimohunt most of them are streaming. i think you can find who is streaming on twitter
[1:22:03] Hazard: @jannieglass Fire, rogue, boomie was pretty dominant in SL. There's not as much variance as you seem to think. Maybe you just don't like this comp?
[1:22:06] Laptican: @BizBichou I hope you're joking :p
[1:22:08] khannivore: tools
[1:22:09] flywinget: @Dez747 "tanks health isnt moving on a 22, game is so bad"
[1:22:20] Ultratoasted: @meeix PogChamp tyty
[1:22:23] Dez747: @Dez747 Oh lol is that it. Thought these were meant to be 30s
[1:22:38] phodi: @Hazard people are just complaining to complain
[1:22:41] Sebleh: How come every group is running two healers? The prevoker dam is so low the h pal is just extra DPS?
[1:22:41] Dez747: The meta is stale though that isnt wrong
[1:22:51] buseereal: Ye, definitely First time here
[1:22:58] jannieglass: @Hazard uhh there was also hunters. warriors, locks
[1:23:19] grubcub: omg guardian druid is good for the first time in forever QQ
[1:23:29] hackiii: @BizBichou agreed NODDERS

[1:23:44] Sebleh: @hackiii seblehOrbitBreaker seblehOrbitBreaker seblehOrbitBreaker
[1:23:45] Laptican: @Kelthiz Who told you it was gonna be 30's to begin with? It's called TGP for a reason
[1:23:47] moffz0r: wow
[1:23:54] hackiii: @Sebleh naguuraIceBlock
[1:23:57] najffo42o: this meta sure is exciting
[1:23:57] MindhackerTV: this is the most boring great push ever... all teams are the same all tournament, no flavor, no variety, just poor balancing =s
[1:24:06] Dez747: @Kelthiz Yeah but why are we watching 22s... I'm tanking a 22 right now
[1:24:06] PelPet: Oh taking on the frogs monkaS
[1:24:24] takedaHT: hey
[1:24:26] jimcarr666: @Kelthiz they have to level their key
[1:24:36] grubcub: @phodi  what was that like almost 2 years ago
[1:24:36] Sebleh: @mindhackertv that’s silly balance is great right now
[1:24:36] thepanoramiks: Wtf Naowh in cat form runing around while getting hit by boss
[1:24:37] sussydaki: @Dez747 they have to build there keys up. they trying to 3 chest each key until its 28
[1:24:42] FlappyMMO: the frogs dont drop sanguine
[1:24:43] phodi: just by looking at people's take here, either 80% of the ppl in this stream are all kapping or just dont play the game
[1:24:55] Sebleh: @mindhackertv balance is doing so well except in single target they need some buffs poor moonkins
[1:25:02] Dez747: @Kelthiz Right okay. I thought they'd just be starting from like a 26/27 that's all
[1:25:04] Kelthiz: @jimcarr666 You kinda missed the point, I said +22 to the guy complaining druid hp not moving
[1:25:11] Sebleh: How come every group is running two healers? The prevoker dam is so low the h pal is just extra DPS?
[1:25:11] Moobot: Leaderboard: https://rio.gg/TGPS2_GroupC

[1:25:31] Laptican: @Dez747 That would be kinda boring if it was 28 instantly ngl
[1:25:48] theslinny: @Dez747 The reason they don't is there's skill expression in 2 or 3 chesting a 25-27, if they started high enough they would have no expression. As you can see some teams 3 chested a 25, some 2
[1:25:50] Dez747: @Dez747 There's alot of dungeons haha

[1:38:54] crippsys: They are giving the 2 other DPS big buffs to their DPS which means the aug "looks" like its doing less dmg when its not

[1:39:12] Draves80: Man I stopped doing keys as melee, because of this meta. Dont even go there xyronic!

[2:43:25] buseereal: @SelistriaMonk same now, in the case his team passes today he might switch if they manage to go onto 29-30 keys dunno
[2:44:10] MrRox1337: @MrRox1337 you can't help it. These guys are the top 0.1% of top 0.1%. If the mass follow them it's inevitable.

[4:12:17] Van_Argiano: @moohuu agreed
[4:12:20] kcamptko: Technology is the application of knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproducible way.
[4:12:22] Kershyll: @KissyChelle no, its from the fighting scene and means technique in gaming context
[4:12:24] gruthori: @sonata223 context makes a difference lol

[4:13:18] ncatter: it should just have been tac instead of tech, since what they are doing is tactics to improve their strategy
[4:13:20] ToxicKnief: @DaBo00 It's not like teams have different technologies though, they have different techniques
[4:13:23] ModeraYsera: just because a lot of ppl use it wrong, does not make it correct
[4:13:30] DaBo00: chat has spoken, tech = technology
[4:13:34] Emiliability: im glad my fellow 15 tech deckers know what's really up
[4:13:35] Sebleh: @meeix it’s contextual

[4:14:19] tettles: @greifat good comms
[4:14:20] sterlandd: Tactic wins a battle but a good strategy wins the war. Easy as that.  :D
[4:14:20] hugsy19: There is the equivalent word in other languages which means secret exploit in video games and has no other meaning. AND it translate literally to Technology.
[4:14:26] Kershyll: @ModeraYsera context is extremely important in language. and a lot of people use certain words a certain ways is exactly how language evolves and advances

[4:29:27] Snayderino: @staafen method still owns that title even with their break up, they have the most world firsts and what not
[4:29:30] SethSteckler: didn't 4 teams have to take a break?
[4:29:30] TrainedTiger: 29 as tiebraker to force other teams into a 29 to avoid elimination by tiebreaker
[4:29:35] lionicicles: did all groups do their break timers?
[4:29:50] Lazeeqt: arena M+ when?
[4:29:50] eksaro: !score

[4:30:08] NewTechGuy: 70 MIL sanguine OH NO
[4:30:08] fremen14: im such a echo stan its unreal
[4:30:09] con_artist__: Sounds like a different way to describe a strategy. That’s a strategic use of a skill or ability. Pretty subtle difference to bother differentiating hence my confusion

[4:30:30] linkasfd: sanguine popping off

[4:31:17] ChadOrc: @Sheeyma tech support is short for technical support not technology support... you proved that tech can be short for multiple things
[4:31:26] dzwen: @Grandpa_Zaltah y
[4:31:52] SethSteckler: @TerraOdium well they said 4 teams still needed to do it and none of them ever went off screen in like the last 25 minutes
[4:32:11] Snayderino: @SethSteckler i thought it was only 2 teams
[4:32:17] Eltorotorotoro: anyone know what bear form All Good and Echo are using? Keeping track of the bear form meta. i see they have toys on
[4:32:27] Sheeyma: @ChadOrc using tech to shorten technique is just a gaming thing
[4:32:34] malven33: How is sheesh in 27 HOI and echo in  28
[4:32:38] gruthori: kennW im blasting damage
[4:32:54] ChadOrc: @Sheeyma agreed
[4:32:57] dzwen: @malven33 echo played the 25 +3 =)
[4:32:58] Snayderino: @malven33 echo 3 keyed the 25 and sheesh did not
[4:32:58] Lonely_TTV: @Eltorotorotoro Naowh usually likes the white werebear but no clue if he is using that atm
[4:32:59] crimsonwarcraft: @malven33 bc echo 3 chested and sheesh 2 chested a 25
[4:33:12] boochacho: where is group c even from?
[4:33:21] kimohunt: @malven33 cause Echo 3 chest the 25 so they are doing 28 which Sheese only 2 chest the 25 so 27 it is
[4:33:30] Cherio01: they are called last minute not last moment!
[4:33:42] Chetroki: Echo the only group so far that 3 chested 25 HOI?
[4:33:43] Eltorotorotoro: @Lonely_TTV thanks i'll mark it with an asterisk

[4:35:36] LGhost: The 3 chest 25 might not be beneficial outside of day 1, if the 27 can be 2 chested and the 28 can't.. It mostly depends on what the highest key teams will bother doing, no?
[4:35:48] boochacho: ellesmere and nerf never practice

[5:00:03] TrainedTiger: 5 sets of 5 minutes left
[5:00:10] djthednadan: on a 27 boss fight without healer. nice
[5:00:30] TrainedTiger: 2 pairs of sets of 5 minutes left
[5:00:30] Sathyron: Last Minute is going for 114 points probably
[5:00:33] DaBo00: @TrainedTiger calebdACKSHUALLY ackshully it's 4 sets of 5 minutes
[5:00:50] Goliathse: I wish different classes gave you more points somehow, depending on performance
[5:00:51] kimohunt: if last minutes time 28 then time the 30 Nel, they will have 113 score which will take n°1 spot today
[5:01:02] Shearin77: maths is hard
[5:01:17] kimohunt: kekw
[5:01:31] plejka123: @kimohunt echo will time 30 Nel before them since they have to time 2 keys and Echo has to time only once
[5:01:33] Sathyron: @kimohunt no they will be on 114 (25--> 28 --> 30 is 5 points + 109
[5:01:35] ArnesMeyer: DinoDance DinoDance !!! SHEEESH !!! DinoDance DinoDance
[5:01:37] DaBo00: LM should have time for another run

[5:02:19] plejka123: echo is already doing 30 and last minute is on 28 so yeah they have to time twice
[5:02:30] kimohunt: @plejka123 if you do the math they will have 114. 109 +3 +2 XD
[5:02:50] TrainedTiger: No way 30 Nelt in overtine
[5:02:50] kimohunt: Echo only have a +2 so 113.
[5:02:53] Cherio01: last minute could end at 114?!
[5:02:58] plejka123: im saying echo will time it before them,they have to time 2 keys
[5:03:02] TrainedTiger: 30 UR so much safer
[5:03:07] dulcius183: can we see all good trying to stay alive?
[5:03:13] plejka123: they wont make it in time there is 17 mins
[5:03:16] Radsol54: wait echo didnt 2 chest the halls
[5:03:19] Sathyron: @plejka123 yes and why is that a problem? Last Minute can just start a 30 after this one and Echo can not start another key after theirs cause time is over then
[5:03:28] Radsol54: i thought i saw it say +2
[5:03:30] snorrow92: @plejka123 last minute has time to to do another run after this, echo doesnt
[5:03:31] Shearin77: CoolStoryBob
[5:03:32] kimohunt: @plejka123 yeah but they have time to do 2 keys but Echo dont have time to do a 2nd keys.
[5:03:38] Chetroki: @Radsol54 Nop look like 28 was pretty hard
[5:03:43] Rasseras: SeriousSloth SeriousSloth SeriousSloth SeriousSloth
[5:03:55] TrainedTiger: 30 NELT needs resetability for the giga pull to go right and get started
[5:04:10] plejka123: yes i know how it works but i dont belive they will pull it out tbh
[5:04:13] dempseytrash: what am I looking at

[5:06:42] TrainedTiger: I bet the team with the Augment Ecoker wins
[5:06:50] LGhost: Sheesh and Echo are technically tied with Sheesh having the time advantage as long as they both plan on doing 29 Halls. Not sure where LM is but it feels like they're right there with them
