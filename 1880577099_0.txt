[5:26:29] rcxdalton707: LUL
[5:26:37] poopyrocks: It's John Negron
[5:26:43] Mhortai: Dragonflight is pretty good. BfA/Shadowlands did a lot of damage I think. Hopefully people start bringing players back now.
[5:26:45] Inquizz: Retail is already dead, but salvageable still. Solo shuffle queues is the best indicator that theres noone playing the game any more

[5:27:20] TY_Dunston: Wow def has new players. I have 6 friends currently in epics to get honor gear.
[5:27:29] Arkitek: @Inquizz oh you must mean from a pvp perspective
[5:27:32] skyestormz: I’ve come back to retail from classic wow and I’m enjoying it. As a causal it’s much easier to play

[5:28:54] Inquizz: Solo shuffle is the most «fun» new and innovative pvp aspect atm. And queues are 1-3 hours. That really says alot. They made LFG cross faction. And you still think the game is blossoming?
[5:29:00] SSD511_: WoW will stay for a long time,  everquest still up image that LUL
[5:29:15] Mhortai: Queues are not 1 to 3 hours lol
[5:29:26] Arkitek: lmao 1 to 3 where u at
[5:29:31] Mhortai: 40 minutes yes, but it's because there are no healers, not because no one is queueing for it
[5:29:35] Pallyofhell: lfg cross faction has been asked for years
[5:30:00] Pallyofhell: and you still can't use que systems with cross factions
[5:30:26] Mhortai: You can LFG arena/ rbgs etc though
[5:30:27] bigboyforyou400: runescape players are just players from ghetto familiies
[5:30:28] baxter5569: i started healing this season, i love the fast queues, but it really isnt worth the toxicity you get cuz ppl are having a bad day queuing @Swifty
[5:30:33] Mhortai: just not normal bgs
[5:30:48] Pallyofhell: thats lfg ranked
[5:30:55] Pallyofhell: that's it
[5:31:15] Mhortai: BGs just need to be cross faction honestly
[5:31:27] Mhortai: and there needs to be solo queue RBGs
[5:31:36] bigboyforyou400: i just cant deal with retail where are u ur on a flying magical ship at this point u dont neve know whats going on in retail
[5:31:52] Pallyofhell: pve has the largest scene in wow. and there's never a shortage of groups for content

[5:32:58] Pallyofhell: what xpac are you playing lol
[5:33:06] Mhortai: Have you played Dragonflight? lol
[5:33:09] Inquizz: Back in the day you could queue rbgs all the way from 19-X lvl and get 3-4 minute queues. In twink lvls instaqueues. Now you sit 1 hour for rbg queues on off hours in max lvl 😂
[5:33:11] KodiakJedi: All I see are dragons
[5:33:12] bigboyforyou400: @Mhortai thats how it feels playing retail
[5:33:23] baxter5569: as long as you play a round of shuffle you get field medic box as a healer in shuffle and you get a 50 token :) that is BoA @Swifty
[5:33:46] Mhortai: @bigboyforyou400  Idk not how Dragonflight feels
[5:33:50] Mhortai: SHadlowlands maybe
[5:33:50] KodiakJedi: The story in WoW right now is actually pretty good.
[5:33:56] KodiakJedi: right now
[5:34:03] lethal_xethal: the 50 conq is gonna go away soon watch, as players keep throwing to get fast boxes

[5:34:27] bigboyforyou400: in space
[5:34:35] lethal_xethal: someone was bragging about it yesterday on someones stream
[5:34:39] Inquizz: The gameplay feeling of retail is probably one of the best games in the world. The other aspects of it, not so much.
[5:34:46] lethal_xethal: fast q for heals, guaranteed 50 conq box win or lose
[5:35:08] insectplato: the rotation on most specs is very smooth
[5:35:15] Mhortai: You need to win at least 3 to get a box...so you can't really throw
[5:35:27] lethal_xethal: not the healer box
[5:35:34] bigboyforyou400: u have to argue to act like u arent the reason ur side is losing
[5:36:09] bigboyforyou400: and constantly show ur at the top of the leaderboards
