[0:09:00] Vyndrodis: hows the no doordash going?

[0:11:41] uniqueusername7: stop watching a show in bed
[0:11:43] Carameldasen: Afternoon :D
[0:11:45] uniqueusername7: take everything out the bedroom
[0:11:47] harzu_: do you drink a lot of caffeine
[0:11:59] m_dep: you have an extreme late circadian rhythm, people are binned into 5 groups (extreme early/late, early/late, normal) and its really hard to fight it
[0:12:03] uniqueusername7: when you go to bed actually go to bed, no coffee or drugs
[0:12:14] evnaae: Tell Dorki to get his ass in your group to come tank and do some 30's
[0:12:18] Ventorpoe: true
[0:12:27] Ventorpoe: i have to have it or i die
[0:12:28] kwizzzz: life is much better without caffeine, i dropped it almost completely
[0:12:31] uniqueusername7: even if you wake up after 5 hours try and get back to sleep, gotta train your body to sleep
[0:12:44] m_dep: its like an inbuilt thing to some degree
[0:12:48] m_dep: its habit + also genetics
[0:12:52] uniqueusername7: adult ICANT
[0:13:29] Razdruid: I worked for 10 years on night shift. It took me 6 months to break out of the rythmn of sleeping during the day or at odd times. everyone is different
[0:13:47] sim967: I was told to cut out coffee within 8 hours of when I want to go asleep, caffeine affects the quality of your sleep
[0:14:01] uniqueusername7: up till 3am gaming, up at 7 for school
[0:14:08] uniqueusername7: peak gaming
[0:14:20] sim967: having caffeine in bloodstream decreases the amount of REM
[0:14:23] Valleerion: @sim967 I can drink a rockstar/monster 30 minutes beore i go to sleep, and ill slepfor 8 hours haha
[0:14:41] OortCloudBig: u should slam water first
[0:14:43] uniqueusername7: that doesnt sound healthy at all
[0:14:43] kwizzzz: "healthy"
[0:14:45] leubinator: just have a 24/7 coffee infusion
[0:14:59] Lime_the_citrus: @Valleerion It's mainly about quality of sleep and not the hours when ppl talk about this IIRC
[0:15:00] harzu_: BASEG
[0:15:04] Ciqq: *judging intensifies*
[0:15:05] ClipCraft: wait you stopped drinking energy drinks?
[0:15:14] Vyndrodis: For me, waking up at a consistent time and energy is all about having a regular or set activity for after you wake up. Workout, showers, whatever as long as its consistent
[0:15:26] leubinator: i had to stay up till 6 am to watch the chiefs beat up the dolphins and even i was up earlier
[0:15:28] Valleerion: @Lime_the_citrus oh 100% I wake up dang  rested. You know the sleep wher you wake up an go what the hell day is it
[0:15:28] leubinator: streamers man
[0:15:30] zachl_: i can’t wake up in the morning without chugging water cause my eyes feel heavy and dry asf
[0:15:30] uniqueusername7: you can just wake up by taking a shower or something, drinking 5 coffees isnt the route
[0:15:34] Vyndrodis: human body likes patterns
[0:15:35] kondelol: yo
[0:15:44] evnaae: Caffeine is good for you and people don't understand that. Just don't go crazy with it lol. I have around 400-600mg a day and im still very healthy. I know people that take 1200mg of it and are still very healthy, Just dont take it and do nothing lol. Start moving around and doing stuff
[0:15:57] Drixcie: My sleep schedule has become more normal in the last couple of year. Before I slept during the day as soon I had the chance. I am 48
[0:16:08] uniqueusername7: hooking up the redbull IV like a normal person
[0:16:13] ClipCraft: i literally roll out of bed to drink a energy drink lol
[0:16:15] uniqueusername7: doesnt slam a can or something degen
[0:16:18] sim967: caffeine is fine, in moderation
[0:16:28] MimiBear21: caffeine <3
[0:16:31] m_dep: Caffeine/habit definitely affects things, but also just genetically you probably have an "extreme late" circadian rhythm or you wouldnt have been able to stay up til 7 even with caffeine
[0:16:44] m_dep: @zachl_ yep, now that im 30 same for me

[0:21:18] Clankoo: do you have a raid guide for disci priest ?
[0:21:25] 33GUNDY: as long as your verbal waycrest is easy
[0:21:34] catechism__: AD/BRH/Fall are the easiest. DHT/WC/THOT are mid and depend on affixes for me. EB and Rise suck
[0:21:38] trentbail23: @33GUNDY xD

[2:46:31] reppap: i think they won the dungeon
[2:46:46] n0s0upbr0: brother got off season of discovery and became relevant again
[2:46:50] n0s0upbr0: growl heals are big
[2:46:52] Vods: Dead 30s into the boss btw Chatting
[2:46:52] swattduck: wo wo whatwawahwawhat
[2:46:55] RoyalCheese0_0: no pi tho Kappa
[2:46:57] swattduck: what was that skip
[2:47:18] Ciqq: @swattduck DH can jump over and go passenger mount so people can mount in across the barier
[2:47:20] drdrozd12: this is a raid boss on tyran
[2:47:23] BobPlaysTheGames: You can Rescue, vdh leap etc. past the game
[2:47:28] Ciqq: and in this case SP gripped growl so he could get a drink in
[2:47:38] swattduck: looool didnt know this
[2:47:40] swattduck: nice
[2:47:42] ShaggySummers: 500mio hp lul
[2:48:00] Ciqq: @ShaggySummers ye but 400% damage most of the time
[2:48:14] stagpul: PausersHype
[2:48:50] Razdruid: not even tyran and people are getting absolutely trucked
[2:49:00] n0s0upbr0: i think the add is fortified
[2:49:03] n0s0upbr0: not sure tho
[2:49:08] swattduck: serious question, how do u fight this boss on tyran +29, i mean you have some deff cds yes but if they are all used what do you do then, cause i think the boss will just oneshot u with that smash
[2:49:26] Ciqq: @swattduck there are group defensives and personal defensives, you rotate them
[2:49:27] n0s0upbr0: the add is fortified the slam is tyrannical I wanna say
[2:49:35] feen33: @swattduck i think if you arent able to live the stomp with nothing from full hp then the boss is unplayable for you
[2:49:52] lol_kronuss: @swattduck the actual problem is add overlap with slam
[2:50:04] IAttackYou: how come keys are never this easy with you and dorki
[2:50:11] n0s0upbr0: ^
[2:50:11] IAttackYou: both of you guys play worse when playing with each other i swear
[2:50:16] IAttackYou: PupperLUL
[2:50:18] reppap: @swattduck watching a vod from some streamer doing it will tell you a lot more than twitch chat ever will
[2:50:23] shale93: shadow priest stocks are rising
[2:50:23] ShaggySummers: because growl reads chat during dorki keys
[2:50:28] goblingher: @IAttackYou Dorki slacking ofc
[2:50:35] IAttackYou: nah, its also because its for the content
[2:50:42] IAttackYou: the comedic content
[2:50:45] Vods: Dorki pulling half the dungeon ofc YEPPERS
[2:50:49] TripleXTN: VE and AG work always in this boss bc damage amp @yumytv
[2:50:52] FrabjousDaze: @IAttackYou cause they are both yumytvStreaming talking in each others voices Kappa
[2:50:56] Grillyo: @IAttackYou you know how god sends his hardest battle to his strongest soldiers? well, Dorki is the arch devil
[2:50:59] snowbot01: how come they have only 2 mins left, i finshed his with like 12 mins left on +8 OMEGALUL
[2:51:04] feen33: @TripleXTN you dont have the dmg amp when it matters i.e. when the add is out
[2:51:08] drdrozd12: because dorki trusts growl healing a little too much, so he does a little too many dorki pulls
[2:51:25] dunt___: aahhhhh

[3:02:34] Berriesqt: @piggwa hey @yumytv what would u say r the absolute best uses u can get out of voodoo totem aside from healing chromie and the thorn dmg on soulbound goliath
[3:02:55] zachl_: crushing depths on tott sentinels
[3:02:57] zachl_: uh
[3:03:02] zachl_: dot on last boss yazma
[3:03:07] zachl_: uh
[3:03:09] zachl_: uh 󠀀
[3:03:12] drdrozd12: yea, always use it in tott for that
[3:03:18] seamuscg: do u have any cats
[3:03:19] zachl_: totem is wayyy more nieche than leaf also
[3:03:45] drdrozd12: when its good, then its amazing
[3:03:57] drdrozd12: but leaf is overall way more useful
[3:04:03] drdrozd12: its good in every key
[3:04:13] piggwa: Can also top tank ez
[3:04:48] zachl_: can use leaf for first boss dht? but leaf better for that
[3:04:54] zachl_: err use totem*
[3:05:19] reppap: totem would have been way cooler last season
[3:05:21] piggwa: Tbh i think it just compliments disc priest really well, they've got all the aoe healing in the world but lacking in st, so voodo just makes up for it
[3:05:23] FarCoast: misclicked his name plates
[3:05:45] drdrozd12: its definetly a good trinket
[3:05:54] zachl_: totem woulda been good last season but you still woulda perma taken beacon
[3:06:03] zachl_: *sadly*
[3:06:06] reppap: or both
[3:06:19] zachl_: nah cause you needed to wear your OCE
[3:06:51] piggwa: tank trinkets were pretty cool last season
[3:07:13] reppap: i dont think  beacon was that mandatory tbh, it's good damage for sure but keys rarely depended on the healer having a beacon
[3:07:16] piggwa: The fact that some classes have the highest parses this season while using it xd
[3:07:42] zachl_: @reppap if i wore anything but those two trinkets even at 437 ilvl i got scolded by my tank
[3:08:08] reppap: maybe he was wrong PupperLUL
[3:08:43] zachl_: i had 447 trinkets but couldn’t wear cause if i didn’t wear oce beacon he’d get mad
[3:08:52] zachl_: BatChest i love raid trinkets

[3:58:50] greatangelsanguinius: @reppap ah
[3:58:52] Emm_Zee: Hmm I would think it's DA because xddPeat would track voidform but have no idea what DA is xdd

[4:00:48] Lonely_TTV: You only run VF if you pull big all the time the only thing VF is better at is keeping up dots, its way less dps on lower target counts @triplextn so he is likely DA

[5:07:41] JMaC727: lmao
[5:07:57] sukoWoW: nerf muted, jpc wasn't havin it
[5:08:23] praysten: nerf got mad at elles and went silent for the rest of the night. jpc called him on it being a BS way to handle his frustration. nerf stayed muted and jpc said "bye forever"
[5:08:26] JMaC727: now our healer is NonVerbal?

[5:09:54] Mjawwww: chatters stay verbal and all will be ok
[5:09:56] Penwryn: While I agree the situation was handled poorly, I have no idea why Nerf acted the way he did. He's always rubbed me the wrong way, but IRL circumstances could put him in a negative mindset, unfit for the role he was playing.
[5:09:58] sukoWoW: theres lots out there, got some catchin up to do lol

[5:17:47] kondelol: garf TeaTime I need more drama
[5:17:49] Penwryn: Hpal lacks healing and damage, but has good CDs. Shaman is tanky, but runs out of CDs for long fights. Pres is janky. Hpriest is actually probably the closest, but isn't disc in the way it heals.
[5:17:52] flickflackoverduck69: as disc i strugle with that stuff

[5:28:36] RamblingJosh_: I mean in the past there just wouldn't be a S4, so i wouldn't really call it phoning it in, at least yet
[5:29:24] kurusaij: i do feel like its really lame they arent releasing another raid. Especially with the time in between the last raid and the next expac and considering the amount of hype/publicity RWF gives the game

[6:15:29] n0s0upbr0: nice play on words
[6:15:29] Vyndrodis: yeah there was a distinct difference from what they had tracked in their software versus what they did as a live input recording over the track, so that alignment and blending needs a bit more work. some more layers will help with the chip sounds sounding too bright as well
[6:15:36] kondelol: any Weedge ?

[6:19:32] baseboned: at least Chicago isn't windy tho amiright?
[6:19:32] VladTehLad: @Vyndrodis I agree - a metronome or a beat alignment plugin is needed.. but also, I feel that the concept for the tracks are a very niche use case/audience. Not suited to an "easy listening" playlist, but, would definitely find it's place in some genres (retro video game soundtrack or something of the like).. The thought is definitely there, just needs proper refinement

[6:21:17] Vyndrodis: @Vyndrodis I think the listening would be easier with a thicker texture and a spread of lows to counter the highs. it was mostly high timbres over a upper-mid track. needs some rhythmic mixup and a lot more low in the mix to make it an easier listen
[6:21:20] zachl_: @Weedfists sending it 4 u weed cheers
[6:21:29] RamblingJosh_: I prefer fahrenheit for measuring the weather, even tho in canada we use celsius. It just feels better in my brain

[7:48:05] Asuriuz: @Satimy i'd say in most cases the 30 boss doesnt do any more dmg than a 31 Nerdge
[7:48:17] Satimy: so a fortified 30 boss is the same damage as a 20 tyran boss?
[7:48:23] MBG_95: No
[7:48:26] zachl_: @Satimy i wish
[7:48:34] zachl_: fort 30 is CLOSE to tyran 28

[7:58:16] sarefx: Resto druid feels so smooth when you do things right, you feel like a healing god
[7:58:29] bschs1: @zachl_ oh nice, nvida just stores in my pc, since i cleaned my pc i didnt reinstaled
[7:58:29] sarefx: but when you fuck up you feel so miserable Sadge
[7:58:31] IAttackYou: HUHH
[7:58:40] baseboned: dorki just reading overwatch patch notes during keys
[7:59:14] Kershyll: @baseboned there was downtime to be fair KEKW
[7:59:21] zachl_: @bschs1 ya videos are just something i never like to keep phsyically stored- just stream to twitch and it will store ur vods in a cloud
[7:59:36] baseboned: what if they removed everyone's defensive and abilities just did 25% less damage, would the game be better or worse?
[7:59:45] zachl_: @baseboned worse
[7:59:51] sarefx: that would be boring
[7:59:57] baseboned: would it?
[8:00:03] sarefx: no way to outplay things make things boring
[8:00:11] baseboned: stopping blasting to hit your dr is fun?
[8:00:17] zachl_: a lot of mechanics at the higher level kill u by over 25% of ur hp bar
[8:00:18] Morayeden: @baseboned ?
[8:00:22] Satimy: Part of the reason wow is kind of boring is every class is largely homogenized
[8:00:26] baseboned: it's not outplaying its just a binary hit a button check
[8:00:30] Satimy: especially in pvp
[8:00:31] sukoWoW: no abilities and less damage, thats called WoW classic lol
[8:00:34] bschs1: @zachl_ i'll try that, thx for the tip!
[8:00:41] zachl_: okay but how is hitting no buttons to help urself live better
[8:00:45] zachl_: doesnt make sense
[8:00:55] sarefx: figuring out your limits when to use that defensives or something else is fun in wow
[8:01:03] WhitakerTheWild: ratJAM
[8:01:03] Nightbot: ratJAM
[8:01:08] baseboned: because the  fun part is optimizing for damage
[8:01:14] Mikazu85: Dunno if its allowed to ask but is Floorki streaming as well?
[8:01:27] Satimy: Does Holy Priest do more damage than disc
[8:01:33] baseboned: I'm not sure I believe this, i just think it's interesting to discuss
[8:01:33] imjebb: LETDS GOOOOO LIONS WIN WE GONNA TAKE IT ALL THE WAY
[8:01:35] K4lsdern: o7
[8:01:36] zachl_: @baseboned the fun part is timing the key and not dying
[8:01:37] Morayeden: MODS
[8:01:40] flockheart: o7
[8:01:41] sarefx: @Satimy overall yes
[8:01:45] baseboned: blasting is fun

[8:01:59] michael: jail
[8:02:05] Satimy: @menzlo couldnt happen to nicer people Kappa
[8:02:08] FrabjousDaze: @Mikazu85 asking if dorki streams is a meme in this channel

[8:02:12] Morayeden: SCATTER
[8:02:12] Messyah: Imagine wanting to watch floor simulator
[8:02:13] zachl_: @baseboned no one is blasting when ur dead because no class has a defensive and ur relying on ur healer
[8:02:15] baseboned: being a healing and having ZERO way to save your buddy who didn't hit astral shift isnt that fun
[8:02:16] Klon_____: SCATTER COPS

[8:02:41] zachl_: @baseboned ? thats on them then
[8:02:44] sarefx: @baseboned i mean you're not playing game solo
[8:02:48] Nonritz: Nonritz subscribed with Prime. 
[8:02:51] baseboned: youre right that it might be too much on the healer in lower content, I was thinking "as a good healer myself, it would be more fun for ME to have more impact"
[8:03:12] denemori: @aggroboy but spell reflect can solo bosses
[8:03:15] Mikazu85: @harmless52 sadge
[8:03:18] zachl_: just keep defensives like whats the point of dying at a certain level to a mechanic u cant outplay
[8:03:22] zachl_: that just sounds like dogshit
[8:03:47] zachl_: in both lower and higher content
[8:03:48] sarefx: without defensives you just a hit a wall when you are oneshot
[8:04:00] NkKouros: @baseboned high keys aren't about the healer, have never been
[8:04:01] baseboned: that happens now with defensives just at a different level
[8:04:13] zachl_: ya but the difference is that u can live
[8:04:21] zachl_: you wouldnt if u didnt have smth to press or an aug evoker
[8:04:29] NeptuneGaming9: Why do pugs I join die on this trash on repeat until its all dead
[8:04:31] baseboned: fucking augs
[8:04:43] zachl_: aug would be even more required
[8:04:44] baseboned: this trash sucks donkey balls that's why
[8:05:05] Aggroboy: Aug kinda DPS loss at +20 and below
[8:05:16] Satimy: @yumytv sorry if this has been asked but what happened to JPC
[8:05:22] WhitakerTheWild: Spreadge ratJAM
[8:05:25] FrabjousDaze: !nonverbal

[8:05:56] Melancholy_Mode: amz KEKW
[8:05:59] baseboned: pesto maybe?
[8:06:04] karbonMAYne: ya everyone dies on this
[8:06:06] feen33: this trash kinda unreal
[8:06:14] karbonMAYne: this is a +5 death trash room
[8:06:23] K4lsdern: it's the entended way to deal with the room
[8:06:23] karbonMAYne: the rest of the key is free ish though
[8:06:27] dharmov: what's the "dispel"/"dodge"/"spread" addon?
[8:06:27] K4lsdern: intended*
[8:06:28] dpayan2: what does jumping off do with the chronoburst
[8:06:29] skorchhx: Deadge
[8:06:31] cajovysacok: every key is geting worse
[8:06:48] LordAnomandaris: -50% damage from bloom is needed.
[8:06:55] Aggroboy: had a PuG evoker from Area52 raging because team didn't skip final trash pack
[8:06:56] Canwestop: become nonverbal 变得非语言 tiger paw incident 虎掌事件 ambition dissolves 野心解散
[8:07:26] baseboned: i never understand pugs getting mad over route stuff, like its a pug
[8:07:37] Aggroboy: imagine raging over sub +20 skips, Augs are something
[8:07:45] karbonMAYne: im watching dorki and them get farmed by fall lmao
[8:07:56] karbonMAYne: looks like my group :(
[8:07:58] jukeboxherokid: @skorchhx pretty sure its just to spawn less adds while getting dmg off team
[8:08:02] FrabjousDaze: @karbonMAYne dorki is in this key
[8:08:15] karbonMAYne: @FrabjousDaze ya im saying it happens to the good players too xD
[8:08:16] baseboned: seen people get super mad about not skipping that solo dragon that flies in, on an 11, like are you serious
[8:08:54] FrabjousDaze: @baseboned step 1: get out of the 11s bracket Kappa
[8:09:01] Aggroboy: i was like, dude we don't have a rogue, the Aug then said everyone should use potions, even at a +13
[8:09:12] discomancer1: @baseboned you ask too much of me
[8:09:24] baseboned: I was farming crests on some rat alt, I kind of like pugging low keys just to experience pugs in the wild, its interesting
[8:09:38] MBG_95: @baseboned probably because anyone doing an 11 wants to be in and out asap, so pulling it adds 1-2mins to your timer for no reason
[8:10:08] baseboned: you can kill it in the time it takes to type ???
[8:10:09] sarefx: for guys wanting in and out these packs are like 30s on 11
[8:10:10] IAttackYou: xdd

[8:10:47] Aggroboy: yeah but expecting low-mid key pugs to all have zephyrs ready is unreasonable

[8:10:53] Bwelder87: how fucking bored is na
[8:10:57] IAttackYou: or not mean enough
[8:11:00] IAttackYou: hard to say
[8:11:02] relimee0: @IAttackYou real
[8:11:04] sarefx: when i was farming tank trinket in fall i was just insta pulling dragon if i saw that someone doesnt seem to know skip, no point in dragging it when it dies instantly anyway
[8:11:05] flockheart: dorki is the one starting shit
[8:11:16] relimee0: i'd let dorki whip me
[8:11:29] flockheart: WIDEDUCKASS

[8:29:36] Ikitoro: @NeptuneGaming9 guessing
[8:29:55] discord_421: How did they bug out the dragon you skip after second boss, struggling to figure it out.
[8:30:08] murazzond: @discord_421 distracted by rouge it seems

[8:44:36] swerllwow: growl/chat, I have a healer question. If you get the debuff on second boss of fall, should you move with the fast zone or stand still? which is better for the healer.

[8:47:00] swerllwow: that has not been my expirience
[8:47:03] swerllwow: but idk
[8:47:05] mistr__p: they should just nerf rise already
[8:47:06] 07Kid: !talents
[8:47:06] Nightbot: Current disc talents, might change later idk https://imgur.com/a/KkD8HHd
[8:47:09] dillydilly4206969: real and true
[8:47:15] WhatAShock: 6/8 runs last week was rise
[8:47:16] FrabjousDaze: thats a copypasta if I ever heard one
[8:47:17] rainbowcereal: i heard biden is personally looking into this matter
[8:47:18] Patrikhg: obvious since they play anything but those keys
[8:47:22] cajovysacok: it should be random your are just paranoid
[8:47:25] Neztea: give up vote
[8:47:28] mistr__p: true and real
[8:47:28] RamblingJosh_: Well certainly more than I'd like, anyways
[8:47:29] bigswiss6456: bro my key had turned into rise like 3 times more then anything else
[8:47:37] javybavy: i swear i get rise so more than other keys
[8:47:41] Lagbugddosdc: @swerllwow you should figure out a general idea of who you want to dispel first @swerllwow it doesnt matter that much until you get into higher keys
[8:47:41] ritsrawr: @yumytv as someone who does some coding on the side... im like 99% sure that line of code is literally just a 1-8 random number generator
[8:47:41] Fenrysk: yeah i hate it, last two weeks me and my guildies are all rise and fall
[8:47:44] TaioJ: we had only rise keys last week
[8:47:49] Fenrysk: and whenever we do clear it we don't get any of the good loot from it
[8:47:52] K4lsdern: one wipe into 5 minutes of flying Pog
[8:48:00] Fenrysk: haven't seen a weapon or mirror drop at all
[8:48:01] dankNstein_: rise needs better checkpoints and 300% mount speed on the platforms to go to next zone
[8:48:07] Alarius_: i've had multiple rise keys today
[8:48:09] TaioJ: i mean our team got all rise from vault
[8:48:22] Alarius_: they all failed because the timer is bad and for reasons like you said
[8:48:23] javybavy: no its a higher chance to get rise because you are never actually DOING a rise key
[8:48:37] TaioJ: yep
[8:49:01] Okiesmokie: @ritsrawr Can't be 1-8 because you don't get the same key you just ran
[8:49:07] Xurmi: I dont remember the psych term but I think it is that you are more likely to remember negative experiences than positive ones
[8:49:17] Alarius_: straight up that logic tracks
[8:49:22] FrabjousDaze: but then literally no one would roll black rook hold Kappa
[8:49:26] GooseComics: @dankNstein_ it really just needs you to teleport you to the next zone right away. NO travel time
[8:49:37] baseboned: it's a form of confirmation bias
[8:49:47] baseboned: maybe just negativity boas
[8:50:04] Aggroboy: noob civilian question about great vault, do dungeon slots only give dungeon gear?
[8:50:13] Minigamer911: Since we're talking about rise, the true question must be asked
[8:50:13] GooseComics: @Aggroboy yes
[8:50:20] specialtydish: Omg I love this track
[8:50:24] Aggroboy: thanks! o7
[8:50:25] Minigamer911: If someone dies to the orbs knocking them off, who is at fault?
[8:50:28] Duckduckgoose38: Does your vuhdo profile work for SoD druid?
[8:50:33] FrabjousDaze: @Aggroboy dungeon gear and tier pieces
[8:50:37] javybavy: wheres the gamer music from earlier
[8:50:40] Okiesmokie: @Minigamer911 Both people
[8:50:42] chemcat5: @Aggroboy yes, and are the only way to get myth track level gear from the dungeons
[8:50:45] Aggroboy: is that Shingo music
[8:50:49] specialtydish: It is
[8:50:54] Minigamer911: The autorunner straight line that hit it, or the autorunner straight line that ran in to a giant swirl oddoneHmm
[8:50:54] yungbooma: do you guys just miss a lust cuz u want to lust boss
[8:51:15] Aggroboy: @FrabjousDaze @chemcat5 thanks SeemsGood
[8:51:22] ritsrawr: @Okiesmokie >>IF var=<current key> THEN <Roll again> ... i guess
[8:51:30] Minigamer911: I lean towards the person who got knocked off
[8:51:54] Okiesmokie: @ritsrawr That seems incredibly inefficient, it's more likely to be a list of keys and they remove the one you currently ran and random from the rest
[8:52:19] Okiesmokie: @ritsrawr But that alone is showing that there is at least some bias in the rng calculator
[8:52:44] Aggroboy: the software team im working at is cutting headcount, bosses believe AI can increase productivity
[8:52:44] ritsrawr: @Okiesmokie true ..
