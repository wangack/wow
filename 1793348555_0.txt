[3:32:40] Thdlock: i mean magmarox is clearly unfinished
[3:32:48] Thdlock: but zskarn was a 2nd pull kill

[6:00:05] mooncaster2034: I like this system
[6:00:11] robertjordan83: where can i find this chart?
[6:00:19] hammack52: i like the crest so i want those to stay the way they have it planned but i hate the gear break down, i dont think they need all those different teirs of gear
[6:00:20] mooncaster2034: im an snchanter too
[6:00:27] mooncaster2034: enchanter*
[6:00:36] Sarcastard: Cesspool in discord
[6:01:06] strike879: what was the alt friendly part again they did do something that made the crest part friendly for alts but i cant recall what they did exactly
[6:01:37] magemaster225: @strike879 alts pay half upgrade cost
[6:01:49] tastytictacs: the IO requirements were the bane of my alts
[6:02:09] hammack52: @strike879 they made it so that you get a 50% discount to the flight stones if your main has a item level for the piece higher than what you have
[6:02:10] TheAllMightyHalfhorns: TheAllMightyHalfhorns subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months!

[6:02:44] Phoxzy: I agree with you, S2 should be great for Casuals, my guildmates argue with me that Blizzard is making gear harder to get/upgrade in s2.
[6:04:24] Phoxzy: scene change?

[6:05:02] 3dRes: Smoking that true Garrosh grass
[6:05:15] hammack52: i will say that its not harder but its not alot easier if you are looking to get the highest level gear you can from M+, they are just trading one thing for another
[6:05:54] strike879: but it is though? if you were to get your bis item on a +2 now you could upgrade it to max if your luck is so bad you dont get it to drop again in 10.1 it caps way earlier
[6:07:35] hammack52: like i said they are just trading one thing for another, would say its worse but i would say its all that better either, with the changes it will just mean that you will not run anything below a 16 once you get there

[6:16:36] neverbornlucky: Towelliee how come white dudes are ok if Miles from spiderman were to be White in live action instead of black
[6:16:38] 91Niki: The movies didn't give the books justice, if you ask the original book fans.
[6:16:40] gidgeet: but then again Hollywood lacks creativity these days always remaking something and turn it to crap LOL
[6:16:44] tastytictacs: i love the original harry potter and stuff, but id be down to watch it if it's still good. i mean the first few movies are rouuggghh, and even the later movies have some odd acting
[6:16:45] 91Niki: But ijpSHRUG
[6:16:51] 91Niki: I'll watch it
[6:16:54] strike879: depends is amazon gonna make the show? because then its gonna be a bad fanfiction no matter who plays who
[6:16:56] Bestbud: yeah missed a lot of stuff from books
[6:17:01] sethman93: the moviesd left a bunch out from books i think it will be good
[6:17:05] Wcvechten: They missed like an entire game from the 4th movie per example iirc

[6:18:03] carmelchaos: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:18:05] 91Niki: they missed a lot from the books, and cut a lot of stuff short. which TO BE FAIR, is understandable. There is only so much you can cover in movies
[6:18:07] Asyia3: I'm currently rereading the books (I havent read them since I was a kid) and watching the movie while doing to compare. The 4th movie missed a lot of stuff from the book
[6:18:08] PigPenLen: only 8k more to catch steve!

[6:19:35] Bestbud: look at witcher, had the perfect actor for it and all he wanted was stay true to story and writers were like nah
[6:20:10] 91Niki: @valianya That's because it's easy money. They just aren't willing to take risks and hope it bites. Even if you aren't willing to make your own content, there are soooo many books and scripts out there in the world that can be put to life. But again it's taking a risk. you don't know if it will make money or not. Known stuff will always make money

[6:22:15] 91Niki: @Karn1987 ijpHI
[6:23:24] mikejensenn24: As a HP fan myself i think it's dumb that they are making it to a series. I get that you can get more content from the books. But why not ''expand'' the universe or maybe do a storyline on Voldemort on his rise to power or The marauders

[6:37:01] LuiBMHunter: hunters should be ok on last boss? in theory ...
[6:37:19] LuiBMHunter: well bm hunters anyway :)
[6:37:23] Bestbud: is that their way of combating bots or are they just sayin, spend money lmao @91Niki
[6:38:14] LuiBMHunter: oh dear
[6:38:18] 91Niki: @Bestbud Right... but give the creator of the polls the option to opt out. It can make sense in polls that actually matters for something. But not your casual twitch content creator asking what games to play next week LUL
[6:39:17] Bestbud: opt out is a good idea, I didn't even think the blue check mark would pop off as it has but the few times I'm on twitter I see it everywhere
[6:39:29] LuiBMHunter: wonder if tyr is old dungeon tech making it worse
[6:42:10] 91Niki: @Bestbud The bot spam voting is only really an issue for the 1%. Not your average twitter user just trying to get their followers opinions. So yeah an opt out option should definitely be in place

[6:50:42] Nokterian: NotLikeThis
[6:51:43] hammack52: for the spawn rate i think at this point we should be asking for a faster cd on cleasing spells so you can deal with them better
