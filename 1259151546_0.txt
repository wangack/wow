[3:27:14] Crabzor420: they removed the gating
[3:27:16] solsaver12: after my main got all renown to 80 I qut playing SL
[3:27:18] AllDayMan: I just think there's too much systems in Shadowlands
[3:27:25] Seoken1: @tapmach1ne It's about half the total time overall (number of weeks), but the actual number of hours/week may even be higher than in original classic
[3:27:38] NoshTimue: in order to upgrade conquest gear, you have to do one rated bg
[3:27:40] JDoggWoW: can spam thorgast now :D
[3:27:41] Crabzor420: they removed the soul ash and cinders cap
[3:27:44] Ev0hz: It's super easy to catch up
[3:27:47] AllDayMan: me too, i hate torghast
[3:27:58] naruumskie: you can just do torghast and get a 262 lego in  one day

[3:28:07] Digmadness: I agree im over that grind they hopefully will change next exp with less systems
[3:28:08] tywizdom: basically though LUL
[3:28:12] dantezalive: they made the catchup way faster for legendaries
[3:28:13] nareshnalol: Covenant grind isnt that bad imo. Thorghast and the maw were super cancer.
[3:28:13] PooperTrooper90s: retail is mad mind numbing
[3:28:19] soundout1: torghast is easier now and you can run the same wing/floor infinitely

[3:29:38] Seoken1: Wait there is NO raiding on your server? How can that be
[3:29:44] soundout1: the lower wing layer 9 is the most time efficent considering reward and difficulty

[3:41:08] homewrecker101: its 60 cp a win
[3:41:08] j4imu5: Getting the gear through arena isn't as bad as you think. You get a decent amount of honor from winning arena. I caught my DK up really quick.
[3:41:08] Amayseing6: and to upgrade the gear all the way you have to  be like 1900 in 2's or 3's which is so dumb
[3:41:18] Dimitrios90: LUL
[3:41:26] vapegodlars: i started wow a year ago, and tried to get into pvp recently.      I just got stun locked by rogues or watched as druids ran away and healed or went invis lol

[3:41:40] nolifeAlice: sad the game got so pay2win
[3:41:56] lunatik710: You are complaining about grinding but you’ve been grinding r14 for like weeks which is a much larger grind
[3:41:57] denkolainen1: I have 500 wins on my monk, 30,000k conquest so far xd
[3:42:01] mrsmiggles69: som classic and tbc way better, doesnt even make sense to play that
[3:42:01] impleblol: super pay 2 win and really isnt even fun
[3:42:04] djkrae: paytowin? LUL
[3:42:16] razoraH: i could only reach anything if I'd have home office all the time LUL
[3:42:21] Shadow_28: yea its just boring
[3:42:30] bjerretvv: how can it be pay to win?
[3:42:32] insomnolence01: it's difficult but you only need 1500 in 2s to buy the crates, with the new catchups instantly renown 40 all conduits at 200 baseline i think the catchup is nice
[3:42:35] OhNinjaPlease: Ab probably was hard carried, even in LFG
[3:42:35] bjerretvv: you need to play alot to win not pay
[3:42:38] cenixse: i'm doing m+ really like it soon 2000 on my fury warr
[3:42:43] djkrae: im looking on the blizzard shop, not seeing anything to buy so i can win
[3:42:43] s0gy0h: They make us pay for the game but have 0 catch up ..
[3:42:50] insomnolence01: i didnt mailover crates got full duelist in 3 weeks as a fury warrior in lfg it's difficult not impossible
[3:42:53] impleblol: pay someone to boost you for gold which is from wow tokens. Lol
[3:42:57] world_of_roguecraft: @bjerretvv buy tokens, get gold, buy a carry. p2w
[3:42:59] VanishSHRoguE: @Swifty Ur saying you need 100's of matches lol, how much have you grinded compared to classic. I'm more then certain you've done 100+ avs easily lol. Issue is about managing your gear up b4 entering arena. As alot of us state absterge did it with a fresh account and changed name 2x bc people started knowing who it was.
[3:43:02] monkatiwesz: that's because you haven't tried shaman, shaman is op in arenas ofc
[3:43:03] tywizdom: understandable
[3:43:04] RuneBlade: which specc with paladin?
[3:43:16] j4imu5: warrior and hunter are crazy strong... as long as we're talking about retail.
[3:43:20] HondaCRV05: oh no...

[3:44:35] djkrae: LUL if you think wow is p2w

[3:45:18] carscarr: FBI open up
[3:45:19] impleblol: yepp
[3:45:19] wahtabee: If you don't think wow is pay to win you're dumb. you can literally swipe your credit card for gold and turn that into anything you want, including carries.
[3:45:20] mrsmiggles69: I am scared wow classic will die, this SoM has been so much fun
[3:45:20] oldcauliflower: Holgrim believed in Honor. That was the name of his base many times over. Is that Neth! I recognize Fast pass from Disney. Now I think you have to pay for it.
[3:45:20] saiyenale: how long are you going for today?
[3:45:23] VanishSHRoguE: @nolifealice its not the pay towin killing the game. Pay to win on retail is more related to buying carries or Mythic prog kills, token system messed that up. The main issue on retail is the improper systems in the game. IE how you upgrade gear it is a problem.

[5:43:40] swagrlicious: Did some math and you're at 20940 decay and need +2650 to get to r13 0% wich adds up to 23590, this could be 1% off due to pixels. so a high br2 spot will get you there aswell (wich is 11.5-12k RP * 2 cuz SoM).
[5:43:46] Horfent: is classic still worth getting in to?
[5:43:52] Lank_17: he also cant catch me at top >:)

[5:45:33] Lank_17: @Barticletv each bracket gives a set maximum amount of rank points. br14 gives 24-26k, br13 gives 22-24k etc. each week you get hit with 40% decay. calculation is simple after that

[6:30:28] houndamongswine: Might be a dumb question but is poolboosting allowed?
[6:30:46] itzLeoBreaker: Sup 👋 @swifty
[6:30:47] aviduser2: yes poolboost is allowed
[6:30:49] houndamongswine: I don't really understand it tbf
[6:30:55] Its_Beer_Bacon: can't get my head around it
[6:31:05] tizom: have your stream do a poolparty
[6:31:07] tizom: bro
[6:31:12] aviduser2: its allowed to have massive pvp
[6:31:12] Antimateri4: make sense
[6:31:17] king_king10: The more players pvping the more spots open for standing 1
[6:31:29] BaronKendrick: whats a pool party?
[6:31:42] Skillzoorz: I got 200k honor this week at rank 5
[6:31:44] tizom: i would not strema it

[6:31:48] tizom: i would tell people a time
[6:31:52] houndamongswine: I think it's a good idea to be cautious about it
[6:31:53] the_son_in_law: dont stream it
[6:31:57] SIMBOLC: almost like fixing or racketing
[6:31:57] the_son_in_law: i would help you with a lvl 1
[6:31:59] redpadavan: lots of eu streamers did poolboosting during streams
[6:32:06] the_son_in_law: on an alliance account
[6:32:14] Antimateri4: yea don't stream it
[6:32:16] tizom: ya how is suggesting we so that on monday at 4pm is worth
[6:32:19] cobrakai311: Calling AV spam pvp is criminal
[6:32:20] the_son_in_law: i dont think its against the rules
[6:32:21] houndamongswine: Yeah the not streaming it part seems shady, basically admitting it's bad
[6:32:23] simmy_0: its not like honor traiding
[6:32:23] Skillzoorz: Got some tips for gold , Schwifty?
[6:32:25] aviduser2: swifty, send a ticket and ask if its allowed
[6:32:26] Antimateri4: to be safe idk :D
[6:32:31] aviduser2: that way u get a answer from GM directly
[6:32:33] shock_wave89: what's that shield weakaura thingie

[6:32:38] Dak30000: Should be ok
[6:32:40] the_son_in_law: they made it so you cant make a lvl 1 and delete it
[6:32:45] houndamongswine: I'd really just contact, yeah, might be worring about nothing
[6:32:47] aviduser2: Do it.
[6:32:47] Bruegs: He is right, bliz is spastic when it comes to what is an exploit and what isn’t. And who you are can sometimes bring more scrutiny on them.
[6:32:49] beatfreaks: I don’t think padding is against the rules, it’s mostly the bots that padded back in the day that got banned.
[6:32:53] ipositive: I've never seen anything against pool boosting
[6:32:56] KazakiTV: dont do it you will get griefed plus its boring
[6:32:57] Dak30000: You can’t ban alts
[6:32:57] Antimateri4: LUL GMs? LUL

[6:33:34] king_king10: swifty go now
[6:33:37] Lank_17: pool boosting was against the TOS in classic because people were DELETING the characters but they stayed in the bracket, it wasnt intended
[6:33:44] Lank_17: doing it on your 9 character slots is not against TOS
[6:33:47] aviduser2: swifty send a ticket, people in chat are just guessing. That way you get a real answer from a GM @Swifty
[6:33:49] houndamongswine: We can eat popcorn, now please go make it while I pvp lol hahaha

[6:34:32] Skillzoorz: ye "don't look up" I watched last night with my GF, it's pretty good
