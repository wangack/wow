[6:09:14] Hizuru1: @Lazeeqt Because Havoc is overnerfed and weak
[6:09:17] Shredmuffn: @davidbleaja you mean the only comp that wins vs a Ret?
[6:09:19] Undeadmerlin: @EdgySanTV Did more than the mage.  thought he didn't do any?  They got double block etc.. I think you're just mad it took one of the best mages in the world and every CD known to man to kite around that long.  But ya sure.. ret paladins are fine.  Not like they beat them 3-0 either
[6:09:20] Rands60: cdew vs P boy gonna be best matchup
[6:09:20] chaosb0rn: THE ONLY NERF THAT RET NEEDS ITS THE WINGS. EVERY 1 MIN WINGS. JUST DO IT 1.5 OR 2 MINS AND ITS GG. NOTHING ELSE
[6:09:26] MizzusE: GlitchCat
[6:09:28] Hamhocks11: @Lazeeqt cause it isnt op like in the beginning of df, once it gets a buff everyone will reroll.

[6:09:56] david_1k_andy_j0nes: B-?\) I've played arena since 2010 and reached 1800 twice, trust me when i say chat knows nothing
[6:09:58] ThisIzD: Ziqo in a turtleneck is a vibe.
[6:10:01] felstorms: DH needs meta CD reduced to 2 minutes and 20% buff to chaos strike
[6:10:04] ram13ll: where can we see the EU games?
[6:10:06] aroamngpanda: Why does everyone poo all over the DH. It‚Äôs a very mobile fun class.
