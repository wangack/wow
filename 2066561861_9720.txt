[5:29:09] emecci: You need to see the rise tech MightyTeapot
[5:29:10] NotYetRatedd: I just smashed my TV in front of 30 guests at my party because of this key. My wife just took our crying kids and said they’re all spending the week at a hotel. This team has ruined my life and my party. I can’t handle this anymore. Goodbye dawg . I am no longer a fan..
[5:29:22] ViviLouF: dogs are litterally done for
[5:29:32] NotYetRatedd: it is joever
[5:29:39] emecci: Not that
[5:29:51] emecci: They make a portal from Battlefield to morchie
[5:29:55] NotYetRatedd: they port the riftmages over to the other platform and use that as a a TP
[5:31:21] hatad: damn
[5:31:22] NotYetRatedd: this is the tech we we're missing to qualify surely
[5:32:27] Angeels: warlock is just so good for everbloom
[5:32:32] Angeels: dps scales well with the large pulls
[5:32:38] Angeels: and gate is broken for it
[5:33:08] Angeels: and on fort week you skip all the horrible trash too
[5:34:08] hatad: vivi should get better and do big dps and heal so you can 1 more dps in
[5:34:10] Angeels: honestly its difficult to be motivated for mdi unless you're close to qualifying already
[5:35:06] MightyTeaBot: doot doot
[5:35:49] kreedtao: doot doot
[5:35:50] MightyTeaBot: KREEDTAO IS THE CHOSEN ONE!
[5:35:53] Angeels: well yes but thats kind of the issue when its once every 9 months or so, its a unique skillset so for many its just not worth the time to put into
[5:36:00] Angeels: kind of a summit gw2 pvp angle
[5:36:01] hatad: this teams are to good
[5:36:02] TheLegendaryLyn: This honestly sounds like any of the tournaments we ran KEKW
[5:36:59] chewuu: damn whatever happened to playing games for fun
[5:37:13] Angeels: competing is fun
[5:37:17] nohabb: That is fun
[5:37:30] hatad: alot of skilled player in Echo and liquid is not playing in this
[5:37:40] chewuu: thats fine thats your fun but you are saying you dont understand why other people might just play for fun and not to compete
[5:38:29] Angeels: It's a time issue
[5:38:39] Angeels: most people do not have the time to put into it to get anywhere close
[5:39:44] Angeels: Well yeah, but that assumes no other considerations in game tbh
[5:39:58] hatad: problem this guys is gods on 7-8 classes! most people can only play 1 class good xD
[5:40:14] nohabb: These guys are gods on all the classes
[5:40:38] Angeels: Exactly
[5:41:02] Angeels: I mean that is where we need to get to
[5:41:06] MightyTeaBot: Enjoying the stream? Then be sure to follow for more high energy!
[5:41:52] Angeels: maining in raid is fine, in m+ not really
[5:41:59] nohabb: To compete with the top 2 guilds you will need a meta comp but outside of that you can qualify with a solid team
[5:42:01] ViviLouF: HOLY flap
[5:42:05] aFlyingGuru: NECROMAIN
[5:42:08] dolordolo: Gingi god GIGACHAD
[5:42:26] iZZY404_: but they are still very good on every spec even while multiclassing
[5:42:31] Angeels: Perplexed had a similar rise time in time trails
[5:42:33] Angeels: trials
[5:42:36] Angeels: so they for sure knew the tech
[5:43:02] nohabb: Echo been holding down M+ for a bit
[5:43:06] Angeels: Last MDI was a lot closer
[5:43:09] Angeels: than previous times
[5:44:13] Mkiz: it would be good for the competition if somebody else won for once
[5:44:34] hatad: teapot in 2029 breaks Echos unbeaten 6 years run
[5:44:37] Angeels: actually sad af for dawgs they had like no time to practice going into the weekend

[5:45:11] dolordolo: Chadge
[5:45:56] Angeels: when the company I work for is sold Ill take a 5 year break from working and make unhinged rank 1 guild EZ
[5:46:26] nohabb: Yeah to put it into perspective these guys are clearing 15+s day one of a new content patch and full clearing mythic in the first week give or take the advantage these top guilds have are insanse
[5:46:44] dolordolo: @Angeels  Zased
[5:46:49] Angeels: its not just the time and cash, its the lack of cognitive load (xd) on other things like work, life ,etc.

[6:17:50] Angeels: you'd know thats not true
[6:18:03] niko_is_bad: At this key level it doesn't

[6:20:54] tigerfeets: wait what expansion is this dungeon from?? I am 100% sure I've played it
[6:20:59] ViviLouF: Legion
[6:21:00] niko_is_bad: legion
[6:21:12] tigerfeets: ohhh is this like Timewalking?
[6:21:25] emecci: La Legion (French)
[6:21:35] ViviLouF: it's M+ they bring back dungeons from previous expacks
[6:21:45] tigerfeets: wow holy crap, I've never heard of that
[6:21:54] ciraxa: what did they do before this?
[6:21:56] Angeels: yeah only started with season 4 of shadowlands
[6:22:02] niko_is_bad: m+ used to be same 8 dungeons whole expac
[6:22:03] niko_is_bad: OMEGALUL
[6:22:05] ViviLouF: they just did current expansion dungeons only
[6:22:15] ViviLouF: but the seasonals kinda mixed things up i guess
[6:22:25] Angeels: seasonal affixes used to be kinda crazy though
[6:22:29] Angeels: some of them were super interesting
[6:22:42] trbotubbo: People were coming up with tech for Plaguefall and Halls of Atonement over a year itno Shadowlands
[6:22:51] Angeels: and honestly the good ones should be brought back and made into weekly ones rather than the fetid ones we have now
[6:22:55] Angeels: that would be interesting stuff

[6:23:28] Angeels: btw did you see that new world was completely rebuilding their combat code
[6:23:32] niko_is_bad: idk having a 50/50 if the seasonal affix is dogshit or not is a good enough reason to not have the system
[6:24:23] Angeels: they're transferring all the combat abilites into the far more optimised scripting that their dungeons have been using
[6:24:30] oussamahouri: combat is more fluid rn and less ganky , they are preparing for something it seems
[6:24:43] Angeels: pretty sure they're porting it to consoles
[6:25:06] niko_is_bad: All it means is that I haven't done a single mw key this week
[6:25:11] ciraxa: it’s just varying degrees of annoying each week
[6:25:13] niko_is_bad: cus others dont want to play
[6:25:31] oussamahouri: @Angeels when u plug in the ps5 controller, it shows PS icons
[6:25:59] oussamahouri: so probably yeah they are porting it to xbox and ps
[6:26:06] trbotubbo: Some affixes couldve been really interesting like Teeming and Inspired, but Blizzard decided to remove them instead of fixing their problems
[6:26:48] trbotubbo: Cryptic was the best seasonal affix ever
[6:26:49] Angeels: thats why I think they should get rid of the current affix list and then bring back some of the old (and popular) seasonal affixes and rotate them biweekly as those do change the way you play the dungeon significantly
[6:27:20] niko_is_bad: wow I get to press my dispel every 30s on an add that spawns instead of doing the dungeon
[6:27:36] tigerfeets: I think there's a rare chance an affix has an unusually big effect on a specific dungeon, like getting the increased enemy movement speed on Siren's Reef which has so many adds on the boss
[6:28:10] trbotubbo: Yeah like what Inspired was

[6:31:34] Angeels: @niko_is_bad LMAOOOOOOO
[6:31:35] niko_is_bad: Meanwhile in mdi you see the dps afk for 30s as the tank sets up the pull
[6:31:38] niko_is_bad: Gladge
[6:32:00] Angeels: they dont experiment
[6:32:03] Angeels: they dont try anything
[6:32:11] Angeels: yeah I thought the same
[6:32:25] Angeels: they added an entire upgrade system with season 2
[6:32:30] Angeels: that is near universally praised
[6:32:44] ferkorkut: “Relics”
[6:32:58] tigerfeets: I mean GW2 put the 6 piece rune on a relic, so we got that going for us, which is nice
[6:33:13] Angeels: games have to
[6:33:22] Angeels: I dont think its enough though
[6:33:49] ferkorkut: something like traits overhaul?
[6:33:56] ViviLouF: rancid single target Zased
[6:34:12] MrMulinn: I think SotO was a step in the right direction
[6:34:16] tigerfeets: Arena net needs to add more boons even more powerful than alacrity and quickness. Like maybe a boon "Speediness" that makes all your skills activate twice for each press.
[6:34:24] niko_is_bad: soto was literally worthless
[6:34:26] niko_is_bad: it did nothing
[6:34:33] trbotubbo: Any change suggestions?
[6:34:34] RullRough: I want a pair of boots that makes my health double in gw2
[6:34:37] Angeels: I think one area anet could really innovate on is the speedrun element - the content isn't challenging but it doesnt have to be if they say yeah okay push the limits of stuff and see how fast you can go MDI style with all their content
[6:35:06] MightyTeaBot: doot doot
[6:35:09] niko_is_bad: IDK what change you see in SOTO but other than weaponmaster everything is the same
[6:35:11] niko_is_bad: doot doot wawa
[6:35:21] cronic: doot doot wideWalk
[6:35:21] Angeels: blizz in hte past wasn't willing to
[6:35:36] Spinerek: soto model implies the oposite of trying new stuff
[6:36:00] vignola99: this franchise basically made blizzard they have no choice but 180 when it gets that bad
[6:36:29] omegasrevenge: XD
[6:36:37] Angeels: @Spinerek sort of true yeah
[6:36:41] omegasrevenge: FF14 lickL
[6:37:00] trbotubbo: Torghast is the reason why im playing Vulpera
[6:37:05] tigerfeets: Maybe in 15 more years arena net will put roles in the LFG, if they break down and admit there are roles
[6:37:17] Angeels: anet has obviously taken risks with their business model, but I dont think they're taking risks with content
[6:37:45] spruudel: doot doot Binoculars
[6:37:50] Scales023: doot doot ?
[6:38:04] spruudel: any claimers SNAILS
[6:38:05] Byrchi: doot doot wawa
[6:38:06] MightyTeaBot: BYRCHI IS THE CHOSEN ONE!
[6:38:14] cronic: @Byrchi KESKITY AVAIMEEEN
[6:38:17] spruudel: wawa 💱
[6:38:31] vignola99: does NCsoft has a lot of say over anet ? bc i sincerely believe anet are not oblivious so you wonder why they dont try harder
[6:39:07] montyshmonty: i would love 2 stick with gw2 as a wow player but the lack of a triangle class system ruins the game for me and perhabs for many other wow players
[6:39:09] vignola99: everytime i saw anet staff they were pretty cool and aware
[6:39:11] niko_is_bad: Why not doing raIders on top of morchie?
[6:39:13] vignola99: but it honestly doesnt show in the game
[6:39:30] Angeels: contrary to popular belief, most games companies are directed primarily by the execs of the actual company, not the "greedy" parent company
[6:39:50] vignola99: @Angeels i seee, i just asked bc i have no idea
[6:40:00] Angeels: thats fine
[6:40:03] Angeels: was just responding
[6:41:03] Angeels: I think it was steve jobs that talked about how over time creative leadership gets replaced with sales leads because they generate more revenue and are more likely to get promoted

[6:47:31] vignola99: @MightyTeapot did you watch the "Jorodowsky's dune" documentary ? jorodowsky was about to make dune with every single cinema pro in the industry but the scope creep was too big
[6:47:34] RaviFFXIV: thats weird because im pretty sure dune was before red alert 2
[6:47:34] vignola99: and it never happened
[6:47:35] Spinerek: strikes...
[6:47:37] vignola99: but the documentary is insane
[6:47:38] omegasrevenge: holy shit requiem was intense
[6:47:53] daf_plays_games: requiem is my favourite film i will never watch again
[6:48:09] RaviFFXIV: maybe just an ad or something yeah
