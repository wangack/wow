[2:56:21] HawtPepperTuna: trivial quests show up on the minimap not worldmap?
[2:57:00] ZakuzaGB: Because bolvar is the manliest man
[2:57:02] Inthezonewow: isnt it because he is infused with life from red dragonflight
[2:57:11] Cosmolus: @TRAIN3R They always work on something big and in the end it comes down biting them in the ass.
[2:57:13] ZakuzaGB: I like bolvar i just feel they didnt use him enough/properly

[4:29:18] flebbooo: idk at this point people like xqc who are pushing these limits just feels selfish/ego andy behvaior
[4:29:27] HexaDroid: xqc is so overrated, half the time I don't even understand him
[4:29:27] GiraffeHydra_: Double standards are the best standards. Also, don't put that on us bipolar peeps, his shit is straight up dissociative personality
[4:29:41] Aquadriel: he was loud about anti hottub meta.

[4:31:37] BoiAtomico: as soon as you say "He can't be that stupid" people prove they can be even worse KEKW xQc is known for being on the idiot side of life
[4:31:41] Frank4LuLz: nothing wrong with boomers, we own homes , good cars and some have a nice woman to cook for us
[4:31:50] M0nkTV: mb he is 5head and streaming those episodes bevcause he tries to neglegate the rebroadcast meta for any kind of dmca series and try to stop the little content creators to do that
[4:32:18] GodKingMuninn: free gold atleast
[4:32:32] DegenerateHaven: why ado people watch other people sleep on twitch?
[4:32:34] Frank4LuLz: DMCA monster is coming
[4:32:38] Aquadriel: maybe he is doing it cause he is moving to youtube soon lmao @Towelliee
[4:32:42] sgtalash: big true

[4:33:05] flebbooo: yep, they just see their own gains in this
[4:33:14] Screamnsteam: @DegenerateHaven just say amouranth KEKW
[4:33:22] BoiAtomico: let's be honest, most of the streamers in "Just talking" are over rated ass faces who lost revelance in gaming and only have following based on drama and their "content" is pretty much non existent lol
[4:33:46] BoiAtomico: Could just rename the Just Talking section to Live Stream Fails
[4:33:56] Frank4LuLz: all these zoomers are like wann-b- edge lords

[4:34:23] fosbjorn: Hi chat, Hi Towel
[4:34:41] M0nkTV: that s why i m thinking he can't be so dumb )or does he?) and he doing it for purpose that stop these chef meta streams and such
[4:34:52] prynnibr: 49% works 1000% of the time
[4:34:58] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee devil's advocate here, but the best situation you can have from an "ends-justify" standpoint is everyone following the rules but you. Thats how you end up with sociopaths rising all the time. "Shit floats to the top" indeed
[4:35:01] Autoexeq: You need to call out Dinosaur Peuinus
[4:35:04] BoiAtomico: I actually fell out with some friends due to the extreme following on the "meme culture" around said streamers. It's abuse I don't have time to deal with lul
[4:35:06] Pharaoh_326: Area 52 they are all dead :(
[4:35:40] Frank4LuLz: TV and Movie industry way greedy
[4:35:59] BoiAtomico: And by god, Bahroo smacks the balls on xQc forehead hard rofl
[4:36:35] GiraffeHydra_: no, don't stream "deal or no deal", its a trap Kappa
[4:36:35] Bayne77: this might make it more expensive in the long run
[4:36:39] facerolljack: you know all those morons just need to get removed from twitch, they fuck over all the newcomers and medium sized streamers just because they are rich and dont care if they cant stream for 6 months
[4:37:01] elvia_: do you realize that xqc is on top and dont care about other streamers, and his team is talking with the gordon team to stream some of their shit
[4:37:03] SpoofAvatar: that's why they have streaming services like Disney+, HBOmax, Netflix, etc
[4:37:05] Amarlian: Large industries like that do not like change. They make money now why change
[4:37:09] kalashftp: Are you friend with a guy called Pielosu?
[4:37:22] MrGattz: yeah every streamer would have to have their own license
[4:37:23] jkitchin75: jeff will take care of it
[4:37:25] KuruxGaming: every stream key would have to be a liscense
[4:37:29] MrGattz: similar to the music industry
[4:37:30] Amarlian: The RIAA was dragged kicking and screaming into the digital age
[4:37:33] eakiller: and worldwide licences are almost unheard of in movies
[4:37:33] MariusBota: prob gonna be a royalty system
[4:37:35] Frank4LuLz: each streamer buys a license,
[4:37:36] kochiee: @Towelliee what addon are you using for your rare scanner?
[4:37:37] MainlyHigh: can you just watch whatver is on amazon video?
[4:37:54] elvia_: you have watch party
[4:38:00] MrGattz: a site wide license would be astronomically expensive
[4:38:02] AvoidtheHat: Doesn’t that exist already? Watch Party? Sure it is only prime video but still
[4:38:13] SpoofAvatar: I could see amazon prime and twitch collaborating, but that is it
[4:38:25] MuttonChopins: there are some companies who would try to collab with streamers to watch shows
[4:38:28] GodKingMuninn: Seperate licenses, different countries, sounds like twitch would be better off just expanding watch parties with prime
[4:38:30] BoiAtomico: Cohh Flanders did a great tweet on the issue as well cohhJam cohhCop
[4:38:31] AvoidtheHat: Ok my bad
[4:38:32] elvia_: I meant they will not buy the right to all movies, they want to push watch party
[4:39:03] Frank4LuLz: gave free facebook analiticks i bet
[4:39:58] sensibleturnip: @Towelliee Oh they no that what they are doing is wrong, but they are just pushing the boundaries of what will get them banned to cash in on the opportunity to make money without worrying about the consequenses. It's also a bit of an ego trip too see if they will get banned or not because they bring so much "value" to the platform.

[4:40:12] Amarlian: Can you imagine if they did, people would be so upset when they see ads in the middle of the movies? "Towelliee Can you pause while i go through these ads?" @Towelliee
[4:40:18] Katestershay: got a jade up with Warmode off
[4:40:37] PvtHudson093: rooJade
[4:40:59] jkitchin75: well prime does have films with adds
[4:41:24] BoiAtomico: @GodKingMuninn this is actually a great point! some rights are so messed up in some countries that the official distributor in Portugal didn't have showing rights for the movie it was distributing, so there was no showing's for F&F Shaw & Hobbs LUL
[4:41:40] elvia_: I think Amazon want the average viewers to buy Prime, and this is why they made the watch party happens, they will not buy any license

[4:42:19] BoiAtomico: @bayne77 no1GUN
[4:42:19] DonnieDice: avatar the last airbender
[4:42:38] sensibleturnip: For sure they will the meta on twitch always changes
[4:42:42] Armdel: pokimane's ban was already confirmed to be a 48 hour suspension i believe
[4:43:00] Sarocus: So close
[4:43:05] Ballsonfire_: @Armdel it changed i believe

[4:43:59] M0nkTV: you see @Towelliee you just said it then they ll get the hint and wont stream chef meta and stuff and the ppl will go back to the big streamers and the little ones wont gain viewers with these meta streams
[4:44:10] PvtHudson093: Shh-kebab
[4:44:23] Bayne77: Shh-cago
[4:44:38] sensibleturnip: @M0nkTV Yeah they will just change to the new meta once it's established

[4:44:49] fumblyfangers: videogames DansGame

[4:45:07] Bayne77: vig-ma-games
[4:45:10] fearxj: playing video games on twitch wtf
[4:45:16] sensibleturnip: @TheAtomicRam True!
[4:45:25] jkitchin75: that just crazy talk @Towelliee
[4:45:47] belfastcl: just chatting feels a lot like the old reality shows, except people can interact with the participants
[4:45:50] Amarlian: Amarlian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! People wouldn't watch people play video games all day. That is just not realistic!
[4:46:01] Sayryn: Just Watching Movies
[4:46:04] sensibleturnip: I feel like IRL strems was the big gateway to make just chatting so big

[4:46:41] M0nkTV: tbh craftuing, singing, painting, just chat and such like these it s completly fine (besides this ear licking shit) but when you gain vewers with chef meta and such it s a NO GO
[4:46:44] Bayne77: well to be fair, Just Chatting is so big because of Amouranth sticking her tongue in a mic
[4:46:57] Pharaoh_326: my wife and i have covid
[4:47:08] luckfore: having covid is the meta now towellie
[4:47:35] Skylin3r: The Nomad Soul is spreading
[4:47:40] sensibleturnip: I had to legit take a break from twitter since it's just all the same 3 things
[4:47:45] KuruxGaming: Yep, wife got tested pos wednesday, me thursday.
[4:47:45] Screamnsteam: idk how people have gone this long without getting it tbh lol
[4:47:49] luckfore: how do gamers get covid tho lol
[4:48:36] ijuki: I haven't got covid (yet)
[4:48:41] Pharaoh_326: my wife works at the hospital and i work as well.  could of got it from anywhere.
[4:48:59] Bayne77: well and theres a big chunk of people who get it and stay completely asymptomatic
[4:49:02] BoiAtomico: I've been locked at home for the last 2 years pretty much, I think that's the only reason why I didn't get covid so far KEKW my imune defenses are shot to shit mosdef tho, 2 years without walking around outside kills you
[4:49:07] sensibleturnip: @ijuki same, but I feel like it's getting much harder to doge
[4:49:15] sensibleturnip: dodge*
[4:49:18] elvia_: i had my booster yesterday, i'm fucked up worst than covid KEKW

[4:49:40] jkitchin75: whats this outside and sun you talk of @Towelliee
[4:49:49] Katrikan: @Towelliee may i change the subject and ask about Lost Ark? Aren't you afraid that free-to-play games usually have pay-to-win options like ''catch-up'' transactions? Won't that ruin the game?
[4:49:53] sensibleturnip: alot of them would have
[4:50:05] Pharaoh_326: i need the amber one
[4:50:05] Effin_Steffin: Knock on wood I haven’t caught Covid since it started.
[4:50:11] jamarky23: Not to say how depressed some top streamers are
[4:50:16] jamarky23: mention*
[4:50:23] Pharaoh_326: been farming amber for years :(
[4:50:30] gold9871: hard yes 10 % chance for it to spawn.
[4:50:36] BoiAtomico: not only streamers @jamarky23 the overall population
[4:51:03] jaydavidsen: He might also have gotten an earlier mutation. Omicron proliferating more in the bronchus makes it less dangerous, delta and previous would build up in the lungs themselves and drown people
[4:51:24] PvtHudson093: its hard to catch it when you dont leave the house.....then again i started a new job this year and spent 2 months in the office learning it and now i wfh
[4:51:38] KaisenSiru: monkaW
[4:51:54] SpoofAvatar: I had delta
[4:51:54] SwongoTV: The Problem is no one is testing for which version people have, so all the data is flawed
[4:52:08] sensibleturnip: @PvtHudson093 I wish I could work from home
[4:52:09] SpoofAvatar: that shit sucked
