[0:34:57] MonsterhunterP: im curious if you can go all the way with ur rogue/boomy since noone else plays this
[0:35:08] zachgamegodx: dh ret seems better over dh warr
[0:35:19] brewtank: do you think you'll call upon lord Mesidan?
[0:35:37] eygton: DH/ROGUE I know you secrets
[0:35:37] zachgamegodx: not as a dk
[0:35:38] zachgamegodx: plz
[0:35:41] eygton: YYUUPP

[0:35:51] Xeliumimar: Let Mes cook on blood dk man

[0:36:14] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:36:20] eygton: DH/Rogue/rsham best comp in the game no cap
[0:36:31] kaoblast: do you think healing is harder now than in the past?
[0:36:46] samiyam: dh warr counter dh rog
[0:36:47] samiyam: eu tech.
[0:36:49] Blessedx: Blessedx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! we're so back
[0:37:03] zachgamegodx: dps feels bad too when ur doing ur best dps rotation and peeling
[0:37:07] samiyam: Kappa
[0:37:08] zachgamegodx: and nothing dies
[0:37:10] eygton: samiBoom samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS2
[0:37:14] dubbfiend: is there a name for the comp DH/rogue?
[0:37:14] Mechgyrasaur: as a dps main whenever I heal shuffles I'm mind blown people heal it everyday unfun for me like 90% of the time
[0:37:20] eygton: samiHTS idk about that
[0:37:44] brewtank: remember when sam streamed shuffle? the good ol days
[0:37:50] zachgamegodx: I like and dislike that nobody has comms all at the same time
[0:37:57] Onshuffle: Fuck healing shuffles
[0:37:57] Xeliumimar: 6 rounds of shuffle is to much, should just be 1 or 2 rounds
[0:38:09] linuswarlock: @dubbfiend Hooligan cleave
[0:38:11] Onshuffle: Game mode was designed for dps
[0:38:13] eygton: sams also an fps god
[0:38:23] freelofear: only thing I dislike about healing shuffle is the healer mmr
[0:38:30] zachgamegodx: thatâ€™s cap @eygton
[0:38:40] NASAdesigner: it would be solo que like apex and every other game lol
[0:38:49] dubbfiend: make shuffle 24 rounds and name it bolo buffle
[0:39:25] eygton: is that why it takes to long? they try to match up good comps
[0:39:41] Mechgyrasaur: I mean you can still rng as a warr into an arcane mage lobby KEKW
[0:39:50] NASAdesigner: mmmm no takes long bc healers dont want to heal idiots
[0:40:03] Shablagoosh: if healers got like guaranteed 15-20mmr for a 3-3
[0:40:06] Shablagoosh: i think it would be fixed
[0:40:10] eygton: makes sense
[0:40:17] zachgamegodx: healers need unstoppable dam and that would make them q
[0:40:37] FoxiekittenWoW: @Shablagoosh people would just wintrade all the time if you gained rating for going 3-3
[0:40:51] Shablagoosh: @FoxiekittenWoW mmr not rating
[0:40:53] Omar4511: they will never do that bec every one will say wow is dead
[0:40:59] RottenBanana209: there should be a addon for that?
[0:41:10] Omar4511: and wow is good for making the game alive
[0:41:10] FoxiekittenWoW: @Shablagoosh but eventually mmr turns into rating
[0:41:14] zachgamegodx: that would make them q
[0:41:14] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:41:14] eygton: you think it would be a good idea to have a solo shuffle 2v2 dps comps only
[0:41:21] eygton: to help some overflow?
[0:41:25] zachgamegodx: anytime disc is meta, wait times go down a lot
[0:41:38] zachgamegodx: like it or not, thatâ€™s the known truth
[0:41:47] Mechgyrasaur: make trinket 30 sec cd Kappa
[0:41:49] NASAdesigner: i really think solo que - apex style would be a better and or another option. 2 friends just wanna play 3s que up get a random 3rd. if they suck ok 1 game lost next game, no different from LFG now, just replace it
[0:41:50] Mechgyrasaur: for healers
[0:42:14] zachgamegodx: s1 with expiation was instant qs, then it was noticeably longer when it got nerfed
[0:42:20] freelofear: hpally is rlly lobby dependent
[0:42:26] corla1: why isnt blizzard fixing mmr? its litterally 2 clicks. none of my friends is playing anymore because they dont get rating
[0:42:31] Raskopp: 0/6 and 6/0 healers lobbies happens all the time
[0:42:44] MonsterhunterP: rsham cant heal hunter, mages, eles as soon as u get one of those its bad also
[0:42:48] dubbfiend: why does rsham do bad into melee cleaves?
[0:42:52] NASAdesigner: and s1 mmr was good so you could get awards
[0:43:02] TheNutcracka: and ppl would get matched with 600+ rating difference
[0:43:13] eainzsp: i think healing is way too complicated and they need to figure out a way to dumb it down. you cant get new healers if the barrier to entry is so high
[0:43:14] notdustinx: thats interesting
[0:43:21] notdustinx: with poison rain too?
[0:43:38] Shablagoosh: is it the armor nerf or was rsham bad against melees before
[0:43:52] Face_rolling: what weakauras do you recommend?
[0:43:52] tdey: dewYo
[0:44:10] damiaN_bda: have you ever heard of not being able to get mes's weak auras to work?
[0:44:18] damiaN_bda: i swear ive tried everything it just doesnt work for me
[0:44:22] tdey: yeah lol we played
[0:44:24] tdey: lost
[0:44:25] Raskopp: yeah man I would love to just SEE things, not just look at the interface to understand whats happening
[0:44:28] NASAdesigner: if ur new just download gladiator losa lol same as mew WA's
[0:44:42] jose_won: Before focus macros, we set our focus and see who they were cloning/fear/etc
[0:44:44] ChumpSeason: i heal w/out weakauras. i know its bad but its such a "busy" addon
[0:44:46] iiconiicz: Do you have a website or YouTube video on the weak auras you are currently using?
[0:45:07] zachgamegodx: @damian_bda I have and itâ€™s usually cause you have multiple versions of his weak auras or youâ€™re not in an arena
[0:45:23] tdey: played against the college team with a NHL sized roster
[0:45:26] Ristvakbaen1911: Are they allowed in an AWC setting?
[0:45:28] ChumpSeason: oh 100%
[0:45:30] Adolescents77: @cdewx just saw a vid of you twerking in venrukis stream you were so young toned
[0:45:39] tdey: 8 - its like the most all season
[0:45:53] What_ln_Tarnation: thoughts on tuning tomorrow?
[0:45:54] Featherfeeet: 2019 yeah

[0:46:55] zachgamegodx: nah sit the q
[0:47:07] jose_won: Remember when someone lost a 3v2 because blizzcon had a time limit for most damage Done ?
[0:47:22] What_ln_Tarnation: big agree

[0:47:24] brewtank: that'd be nuts lol and so good
[0:47:25] zachgamegodx: priority pass
[0:47:28] CabinetMistake: that would be so sick lol
[0:47:37] Face_rolling: thats actually an insanely genius idea
[0:47:39] brewtank: id q so much fucking healer shuffs lol
[0:47:49] freelofear: ur just going to get healers that que and grief to que their dps lol
[0:47:56] shredder1111: put it in a token with the healer box ez
[0:47:56] ChumpSeason: genius idea actually
[0:47:57] TheNutcracka: i watched 2016 finals last time i couldnt believe it was so long time ago.. splice with boetar, fabs and swapzy vs you, bean, snutz and smexin
[0:48:00] Omar4511: but ppl will que healer and feed
[0:48:03] Recyclemanx: just be people throwing as healer for their dps main
[0:48:04] TheNutcracka: sooo pog
[0:48:05] eainzsp: yea they would grief
[0:48:11] Old_Tomatoes: It would be account bound right?
[0:48:11] Shozerty: 6 rounds too much
[0:48:12] Omar4511: 100% will feed
[0:48:13] zachgamegodx: thatâ€™s gonna create alot of apathetic healers, overwatch had that system when nobody qd healer in overwatch 1,
[0:48:14] nikthevoker: it happens alot
[0:48:16] What_ln_Tarnation: good more wins for my healer :)
[0:48:25] freelofear: 100% will feed if they dont care about the character
[0:48:25] pwntrd: you could have one healer alt to quickly feed lobbies for dps prio q
[0:48:26] GoldenA_: the low rating healers are already doing that rofl
[0:48:26] dubbfiend: maybe have to win 3+ as healer to get the fast pass
[0:48:26] NASAdesigner: Orrrrrrr they just redesign healers to be fun
[0:48:26] leeka: maybe every 12 wins
[0:48:30] addyz0r: Then report them and get them banned.. problem solved
[0:48:36] shredder1111: u could have a 3 win prerequisite
[0:48:37] Old_Tomatoes: 12???
[0:48:41] Face_rolling: the amount of people that would feed for no reason compared to the amount of increased engagement i think would far outweigh the other, not that many people would grief
[0:48:42] Omar4511: just remove shuffle
[0:48:43] zachgamegodx: guess what made ppl q healer,? giving them lethal dmg after a year of the passes
[0:48:54] Omar4511: and make shuffle less rounds
[0:49:00] What_ln_Tarnation: how about 2 games at a certain mmr fast passes up to a certain other mmr for dps so healer not throwing
[0:49:15] Omar4511: or
[0:49:16] Mechgyrasaur: if it's 6 wins you could get a 6-0 lobby and then just afk the second one Kappa
[0:49:18] shredder1111: also i think it depends on what healer is meta, people seemed to like playing disc more than they do rdruid/rsham
[0:49:19] eainzsp: wouldnt that slow q's on the back end? since people are jumping ahead in q
[0:49:19] dubbfiend: make shuffle great again
[0:49:21] addyz0r: KEKW
[0:49:29] pharmztko: thatâ€™s 3s
[0:49:30] zachgamegodx: it wouldnâ€™t be shuffle without a multiple of 6
[0:49:42] What_ln_Tarnation: @eainzsp next time they should queue healers then
[0:49:42] zachgamegodx: maybe 12 rounds
[0:49:43] gaulois62: they need to make shuffle 1 games at a time not 6
[0:49:53] zachgamegodx: that would blow
[0:49:54] Face_rolling: i doubt it the healer participation is so low it would take an insane increase to make dps qs slower
[0:49:59] Adolescents77: wash hands
[0:50:02] zachgamegodx: q skirms if you want that
[0:50:02] Raskopp: shuffle has to exist
[0:50:10] Iridiumspx: if anything it would help qs on the back end because in theory if the ratio of healers to dps is exactly 1:2 then nobody has to wait
[0:50:12] eainzsp: @What_ln_Tarnation Im just thinking of the casual that has like 2 hours to play and so will blizzard i think
[0:50:26] kand1nsky: Make it 6 rounds without shuffling the players Kappa
[0:50:29] jose_won: Wld a feard comp back in the day
[0:50:29] zachgamegodx: they should have multiple rated solo q modes tho
[0:50:36] What_ln_Tarnation: @eainzsp i mean if you think about it the dude queueing 2 healer games is injecting more healers into the queue reducing overall queue times for everyone
[0:51:24] zachgamegodx: the prio pass  system brings a lot of people that donâ€™t wanna be on the role and it creates a lot of rly depressing scenarios
[0:51:29] Staink: Can't see the scsreen through the 85 pet nameplates.
[0:51:41] What_ln_Tarnation: theyll be adding 2 healers into queue to take 1 dps slot where as before theyd add 0 healers to the queue
[0:51:41] zachgamegodx: would be nice if tried it tho
[0:51:43] addyz0r: Some low IQ comments in chat today KEKW
[0:51:45] zachgamegodx: just anything

[2:09:54] 101Leet: My Grandma told me I could play the meta class but I had to do it without addons, if I wanted addons I had to play c-tier shit
[2:10:05] Lonewulf_NA: Wingstop is not insane at all.
[2:10:08] Ristvakbaen1911: @Swishinn BWW > Wingstop imo

[2:10:34] Swishinn: the BWW around here are horrible
[2:10:51] Lonewulf_NA: Personally, I don't think BWW is insane either but better than wingstop lol.
[2:10:52] SniggleJake572: BWW is trash
[2:10:59] JaeDee: east coast wings the GOAT
[2:11:05] Ristvakbaen1911: But only go to Buffalo Wild Wings on Tues/Thurs imo. If they have the deal, bone in/boneless bogo.
[2:11:18] Lonewulf_NA: You find the best chicken in random towns in random restaurants that are going out of business I swear bro.
[2:11:18] What_ln_Tarnation: i only eat their wings
[2:11:21] Ristvakbaen1911: The one near me is good. But I've DEFINITELY had some trash ass BWW too

[2:13:41] Ristvakbaen1911: I'm getting a Zaxby's like 5 min from my house, and a Raising Cain's
[2:13:51] Lonewulf_NA: Raisin cains now is mid.

[2:27:46] What_ln_Tarnation: heals
[2:27:48] Cfjordd: I feel like DH gets boring so fast
[2:28:26] harrisponge: TIME TO SIP SOME WINE RN
[2:28:27] slingbladescro: DH is the only class,imo that doesn't fit in WoW
[2:28:53] Cfjordd: Its lore definitely belongs in wow
[2:28:56] Cfjordd: at least
[2:28:56] thorgasm69420: dh was built for controller players
[2:29:00] What_ln_Tarnation: dh literally modeled after one of the most famous wow chars
[2:29:02] slingbladescro: I hate it,and this new class. Awfull. Thats when i quit
[2:29:08] Shablagoosh: dh is literally from warcraft rts games lol
[2:29:09] Ristvakbaen1911: I'd say monk if anything tbh. DH is one of the original big things in WC3
[2:29:12] Shablagoosh: it fits more than evoker and monk
[2:29:31] 101Leet: Nobody's opinion is wrong, but that's damn close playa
[2:29:39] allentrinh: Evoker is the outlier for me. Charged abilities are weird.
[2:29:43] Ristvakbaen1911: Evoker fits more because dwagons
[2:30:06] What_ln_Tarnation: @Ristvakbaen1911 monks modeled after chen which was also from wc

[2:30:40] addyz0r: Dh could easily have been mail
[2:30:47] flames222: DH has a design? I thought it was a 2 button character designed for roblox
[2:30:57] Old_Tomatoes: Felt like rogues were so popular in the first few expacs then they fell off a cliff
[2:31:01] FreddyFerrera: someone tell him that the turnip cant be killed
[2:31:24] Drathimos: he needs to practice his 2 button rotation
[2:31:35] BossmanRitz: oh god you joined the DH train?
[2:31:38] Swishinn: this is peak wow gameplay btw guys
[2:31:38] Ristvakbaen1911: @What_ln_Tarnation Very true
