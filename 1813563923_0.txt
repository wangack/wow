[2:21:15] Visuals66: Im spoiling the RWF fun but all the HC people are just saving all the quests and stuff so they dont waste stones. 2k is the cap you can get by just killing rares and stuff.

[4:59:06] kilox97: You just can't die in retail while lvling, it's impossible, unless you're doing a dungeon and tanks decides to go ooga booga

[5:00:15] futomara01: even now retail leveling is too slow
[5:00:27] xmedpakx: classic is fun and all but its archaic
[5:00:33] Broomba: Lol
[5:00:36] zeiours: I would like some challenge while leveling in retail though, not like classic but just a bit more challenging
[5:00:52] genobear: @futomara01 found the retail andy
[5:00:53] Anacydae: @Disney_Plus_and_Thrust lol never heard nor had that
[5:01:03] jamarky23: @xmedpakx and whats wrong with things being archaic if its good?

[5:01:14] Broomba: Wow, people need to take a break from Reddit
[5:01:18] HimerosTB: Leveling before 60 in retail is garbage and broken

[5:01:54] jamarky23: i think theres a silent majority that wants that tbh
[5:02:19] Slitze: ppl like azeroth
[5:02:25] Lintgamer: Hell no @jamarky23
[5:02:27] Phobiums: Cataclysm too, they tried to make the game more difficult. believe that was the biggest dropoff in players registered
[5:02:31] Rilipso: i would like it to increase difficulty
[5:02:33] xmedpakx: @jamarky23 there is nothing wrong with it it just old and ppl want more nowdays
[5:02:36] emoalll: Fuck hard leveling in retail.
[5:02:46] Broomba: Silent majority???? Wtf?
[5:03:29] TrustNoOneTV: NO ONE
[5:03:30] Glialka: Old content isnt relevant on retail while leveling.. They are trying to make it relevant when you are lv 70, so making leveling slow on retail is not a smart move imo.
[5:03:30] xmedpakx: @jamarky23 i am in classic now enjoying it
[5:03:30] Ortinoth: Leveling in retail is already super easy
[5:03:44] Slitze: HC is a silent majority
[5:03:47] Kierthas: Vocal minority I think is what he means
[5:03:50] Totemkatsu: clearly this is the drunk typing hours
[5:03:51] Slitze: bit time
[5:03:53] Broomba: Seriously people stay off of Reddit, it ruins your brain
[5:03:56] Slitze: big*
[5:03:56] jkitchin75: @jamarky23 thats why there silent
[5:03:57] Veegore: They can't really make leveling harder for retail without changing the entire end game.  when you're whole game is built around end game progression, walling your players behind  "meaningless" leveling difficulty is a death sentence
[5:04:00] Anacydae: Idk in a game where the vast majority of content is at max lvl, and aimed at that, why would you want the journey there to be long and annoying?

[5:04:31] sethman93: classic is just a fun alternitive to when you get tired of retail. and when you want a little bit of both worlds you play wrath
[5:04:35] Epiclurker27893: Harder leveling would just end up with plate classes sitting around waiting for everyone else to catch up.
[5:04:38] mozavich: the hc community existed before the addon though.

[5:07:38] aviddy13: @emoalll yea good idea cheers
[5:07:42] spiked16: i only made it till lvl 12 on my pala classic and gave up on him..way to boring to level

[5:07:51] aviddy13: @aviddy13 how to find them Lol
[5:07:52] zeiours: As I said, I don't want retail like classic, but I would like just a little more difficulty while leveling when new xpac comes out, not saying extreme just a bit more.
[5:08:01] jamarky23: its not about that tho, its about a product that is objectively better than the disney version of wow nowadays

[5:08:04] dracullus: @jamarky23 that is problem with you people, you think twitch is real world, check how many servers are played for hardcore or even wrath, then check how many full realms has retail (yes, counting connected as one)
[5:08:07] Totemkatsu: idk how wasting an ass load of more time is better game play
[5:08:18] Slitze: i think the struggle questing in classic is the hype
