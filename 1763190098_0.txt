[1:36:10] cl3k0: its more competitive, but less "real" imo. they take away the hardest part of these end game keys, which is the prep and endurance
[1:36:13] Bodacious_Hazy: @docsmith06 i mean whats honestly unfair they have access to weapons and stuff at 421 ilvl that we cant even get that high
[1:36:24] Bodacious_Hazy: as in Forgestorm from Neltharus

[1:55:28] Muzluk: I have two questions:
[1:55:39] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: question away
[1:55:49] lovelywaz: Thunderstruck are stuck?
[1:56:00] Muzluk: 1. Can the teams train between the broadcast? Or are the dungeons locked?
[1:56:10] SpoofAvatar: doom and gloom
[1:56:23] Winnnie: dungeons are locked
[1:56:30] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: I think the tournament realm is down between days
[1:56:34] Muzluk: 2. When do the teams get to know the new dungeon of the day (for day 2 and 3)?
[1:56:46] moderatygos: the dungeon is announced when the timer starts
[1:56:48] MrBira: im a noob, how long do they have to keep re-runnin dgs?
[1:56:49] moderatygos: they don't know in advance
[1:56:52] Tremin: @Muzluk They can do them on live for routes I guess? but dont think they can train on tournament realm.
[1:56:53] Winnnie: the same time we do
[1:56:58] Muzluk: Thx :)
[1:57:07] xaub9r9r: Yooooo
[1:57:09] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @MrBira until 3PM PST
[1:57:13] moderatygos: for last stand they cannot train, dungeons are closed outside of the 5 hour daily run time
[1:57:19] MrBira: thx
[1:57:26] Dashuriax3: @Muzluk afixes on live are different than ones they have so they kinda cant
[1:57:33] Winnnie: @MrBira they got about 3 hours left?
[1:57:45] moderatygos: 3 hours 29 minutes
[1:57:58] Winnnie: ty
[1:58:00] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: Cheese is popping off
[1:58:23] MrBira: once they finish one dg, they can re-run it after to try and time it better? or is it the first timed finish?
[1:58:31] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: They can rerun it @MrBira
[1:58:40] 2916nick: When do they pvp?? This is just a dungeon run haha
[1:58:48] Winnnie: they can rerun as many as they want until time is done
[1:59:20] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: It's completely up to them what dungeons they run but at the cutoff it's the total time over all that's what's used to score the teams
[1:59:20] skinyyo: can someone please explain what is this??
[1:59:40] zupa2552: @2916nick end of the month is awc i think

[2:00:57] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: i really like the format of the last stand, i think the complexity of allowing them to pick and choose which dungeons to push harder on is awesome

[2:02:53] moderatygos: @Vanboozled it was delayed to allow players more time to prepare after the 10.0.7 launch
[2:03:10] Dashuriax3: i completely forgot the time changes, im suprised its been so long and only 1 team put the time on the board
[2:03:11] Zed6151: Delayed to when?
[2:03:13] Vanboozled: @Zed6151 March 24 not April 7 unless it changed
[2:03:24] Vanboozled: ah wow
[2:03:25] moderatygos: awc is april 7th
[2:03:31] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @MrBira bear in mind the vast majority of mythic dungeons look nothing like this :p the strategies these teams use are pretty crazy
[2:03:38] Zed6151: Ahh ok
[2:03:38] Meeix: @Dashuriax3 the mostly revisited old dungeons
[2:03:43] Meeix: and improved their times there
[2:04:00] zupa2552: PVP is different , at some point you know what every class does and it's just doing the same thing untill someone of the enemy team makes a mistake

[2:18:42] Bloodbottler_88: You can only defeat a troll if you're in Hogwarts, in your first year. You can defeat it by using the wingarium liviosa spell.

[2:19:24] Tremin: @RagingXRob MWs are plenty viable for mythic plus atleast within the spectrum of what is necessarily relevant for gear acquisition
[2:19:26] SirJonny1998: plonk
[2:19:34] admiraltegetthoff: its wingardium leviosa and not wingarium liviosa...
[2:19:40] ModeraYsera: @Bloodbottler_88 I dont think they knew about dark spells at that time, lol
[2:20:21] RagingXRob: u obv dont play mw if you say that. you can check raider io and see the vast disparity between scores between MW and the other healers. u will see no mw in this tournament do anything compared to a evoker or the other healers even
[2:20:47] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: you're not  speedrunning +23s so why does it matter?
[2:21:01] AaronDhOCE: @RagingXRob ok but what is viable by your standards, I'm not at mdi level but I see MW's healing 23/24 fine

[3:00:20] ジェーり: why thunderstruck doesn't do RLP? O.o
[3:00:20] Jereico: At the very least the Dragonflight story is (pretty) standalone so that's pretty good new player spot I think
[3:00:23] shiiiftkey: Yeah. better anything but SBG really
[3:00:32] daegyn: Ooh Legendary and Cheese basically head to head run
[3:00:42] daegyn: nvm
[3:00:50] Thomas_Huayra: AA, Jade and Ruby are the only way for Thunderstruck, but it's too late and the time to shave off is too great.

[3:04:31] Ahlzen: I'm confused how things are rated?  By key size+fastest time?  How much time does one gain with an extra + on the key or is it always 23s?
[3:04:40] KodyNM: @Thomas_Huayra than just go off xD  and dont do dungeon that alry have a time. should do av or ruby

[3:05:23] Jereico: Yeah you just want to put up the best total time
[3:05:24] Kaelangg: @dhektiqa best time by the end of the 5 hours, top 2 go through
[3:05:25] daegyn: Have Wolves made it past 1st boss yet
[3:05:36] mitigant: I think their plan is improve SBG by ~50 seconds, and then hope they can post a RLP time that is 1.5 minutes faster than Legendary
[3:05:38] dhektiqa: KK!
[3:05:38] Jereico: Sum of best runs in each dungeon
[3:05:40] Winnnie: fastest time between ALL dungeons
[3:05:44] Thomas_Huayra: scuse me? Don't "confused" me, Meeix 😡

[3:11:08] itsdubbz710: @SUPER_MEGA_T_REX just realized that
[3:11:18] mrmudwaters: @thalantas123 cuz I was wondering how much time they can really save on SBG when they spend hours there, instead of trying for a good RLP hehe. Everyone has exactly the same time in sbg, can the effort be worth it…?
[3:11:20] Jereico: I think it was dobbie downer
[3:11:33] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: doobie denier
[3:11:39] EzzLyfe: @MrBlackwell they seem to think its worth it

[3:12:17] anna_zoe_: plink
[3:12:26] Seidrrr: I no expert, but "I doubt, but I am confident" sounds odd
[3:12:29] efcon: what are tehy doign in shadowmooN?
[3:12:29] thalantas123: @MrBlackwell casters (and me, but i'm only running 23/24 on live so i'm a pleb compared to those guys) believe they can't shave time and this is very tight, they discussed it with dratnos and xyro like 2h ago
[3:12:40] thalantas123: but hey maybe they got something in the tank that we don't know about
[3:13:04] WadyCesar: AYAYA ?
[3:13:06] daegyn: thunder gotta believe they can shave a looot of time off SMBG
[3:13:07] Taxel: @Seidrrr I am confident that I doubt coxBut
[3:13:12] Bearman999: would have to ramp up the dps by probably 30 percent to shave significant time
[3:13:23] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @daegyn might be good to just shave a decent amount of time off for the morale
[3:13:26] daegyn: 4:45 Mel is nice
[3:13:31] Seidrrr: @Taxel Thank you
[3:13:34] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: before heading back somewhere else 󠀀
[3:13:46] ultideath: Even if thunderstruck gets a 10 minute SBG, they still need to run RLP
[3:13:54] thalantas123: @Bearman999 that's not really true, they need to reduce the amount of pulls
[3:13:56] mrmudwaters: @thalantas123 just based on all four having the exact same time, they really gotta believe in some mind blowing strats to hope to get even better time…
[3:14:17] thalantas123: @Bearman999 That means they probably look to do some insane pull between 2nd and 3rd boss
[3:14:19] Bearman999: cheese keeps having deaths
[3:14:23] GuardMoony: legendary doesn't even have a time yet :/
[3:14:29] thalantas123: @MrBlackwell i don't disagree my friend :p
[3:14:40] darknarius: odiRage odiRage odiRage
[3:14:41] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @GuardMoony Cheese are the only ones that have finished it
[3:14:45] SpoonDealer: LET DRJAY COOK GUYS
[3:14:50] torx10: why thunderstruck no rlp play?
[3:14:54] Miuuu: "used plagueborers" is an understatement
[3:14:59] daegyn: cheese can afford to bash their heads against RLP all day unless Wolves or Thunder pull off something crazy
[3:15:03] thalantas123: @GuardMoony yesterday TJS was the same they tried until they had a pretty ok time
[3:15:06] zupa2552: a bad time wouldn't matter , so they rather have a good time
[3:15:15] thalantas123: @GuardMoony they don't need to post anything for 2 hours
[3:15:20] Rekiel_: Probably they are just enjoying the show and make the best of best SBG
[3:15:21] Bearman999: yea they have their trash planned out pretty carefully though, not sure what else they could skip
[3:15:22] Tremin: @GuardMoony They were close to having one and could have probably finished it in 20 min or so, but they just exited not wanting to waste time on a slower clear
[3:15:55] daegyn: oopsy with some ball on curb action
[3:16:19] GuardMoony: I've watched from the start. Yes they still got 2h. But untill they post one the other got equal odds
[3:16:26] Tikila_TV: Thunderstrucks tactics revolves around the other teams not being able to finish RLP. 4Head 4Head
[3:16:43] morieta: I don't get why Thunderstruck is doiing SBG unless they have a special strat
[3:16:46] leon8221: cheese down
[3:17:12] mazllli: @morieta they have, thats because they are doing it

[3:19:25] mrmudwaters: Cuz I’m getting excited
[3:19:32] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: But if they're in a dungeon at the cutoff they can finish the run
[3:19:37] Shearin77: @daegyn break

[3:29:40] moderatygos: we kid because we care
[3:29:47] MonstroMart: @itsMint yeah but by improving it more they are securing it more. It's a chill key too why suffer thru RBL when it's over. The casters have to make it interesting but it's over let's face it Legendary and Cheese will pass.
[3:29:53] goesidd: give drarnos a cosmetic that makes his grounding totem look like tettles
