[0:31:27] Martylang: imo its cause tarov is also an rpg not a sim
[0:31:31] rato_de_esgoto88: Squad does movement just right. Perfect acceleration curves
[0:31:49] JohnDoeRadio: tarkov was an absolute incredible game before the flea. i like the flea, but no doubt the game was the best its been and the timeframe veritas is talking about
[0:31:51] metaphour: movement is so important in games... just really turns a community against you if u mess with it in a negative way

[0:32:55] CoolpantsTV: @Essetx it literally is

[0:32:58] neverluckyp: Why does it look smoother back than
[0:32:59] lazlow_1: this game looked so much better as gameplaywise than it is now
[0:33:01] Lawman74: @Essetx Ever heard of adrenaline?
[0:33:05] Derpate10: those were the times
[0:33:05] dager3: Hes not DEAD yet xD
[0:33:09] maddogs_world: imagine if they actaully implemented an adrenaline rush when being shot at. Having real world real life effects in Tarkov would definitely make it stand out among other games.
[0:33:10] PimpsNotSimps_: @neverluckyp cause it was
[0:33:13] aarondotjpeg: aware
[0:33:15] Derpate10: now the Game feels sluggish af

[0:33:31] goatt420: this scene is from a movie called escape from tarkov
[0:33:34] RebelFoxtrot: Why? Its just a side step lean?
[0:33:37] ForlornKensei: Mf playing cod
[0:33:37] delur: glorious e peeks lol
[0:33:45] 0PYR3X: truuue
[0:33:46] WrinkledBallBag: oh its over
[0:33:47] DrPouches: That already was a thing
[0:33:48] MisterBolticus_: holy peekers advantage
[0:33:49] DrPouches: That was a peak
[0:33:53] lnuteroo: im not gonna lie i beyond MASSIVELY prefer old tarkov movement and combat. Nowadays only the no life sweats are going to get high level enough for the game to actually feel good, while it likely takes months for casuals of pure cancer
[0:33:54] JohnDoeRadio: pretty sure that lean is what changed the game to inertia single handed
[0:33:55] EnVFireFrost: siege type beat
[0:33:58] skyblueruru: That’s what was happening last wipe haha
[0:33:59] Canadian_Luke: Its aalready like that
[0:34:01] rodriguezgerardo: That was a thing
[0:34:01] BakinPacman: it turns into siege
[0:34:01] WrinkledBallBag: at peak thats kinda how it was

[0:34:08] galick_gunner: Fast movement makes D-Sync so much worse too
[0:34:08] giornocannoli: TrollDespair 2018 Siege type beat
[0:34:08] imozrabbit: might set a cooldown for that?
[0:34:11] InnerKonflict: inertia is good, stamina and recoil isn´t, old recoil was too low, new is too high. we need a recoil balance and overwork stamina.
[0:34:14] meniK_Dangeruss: Just lurking in the shadows to show some love, hi Twitch chat! menikdO7
[0:34:20] Crankt_: @JohnDoeRadio im pretty sure it was the 120 KG haul raids
[0:34:22] BakinPacman: yeah blind fire was cool
[0:34:23] mtalhasial: that PUBG leaning is annoying
[0:34:26] maddogs_world: If they made it where you get shot at, adrenaline sets in, or had an epenphrine shot, you would be able to move and run like older Tarkov.
[0:34:31] WrinkledBallBag: I think low key interia was a way to combat shitty netcode @shroud
[0:34:32] CROSliffer: peeking and leaning was holly grail of netcode issues
[0:34:36] JohnDoeRadio: touche
[0:34:39] chapistola4: game is fine its just cry baby streamer

[0:38:29] LegaIizeRanch: @GmxxGoose crouch walk andy's cant even play this wipe with the audio lol
[0:38:29] dmskrtaes: PixelBob

[0:39:02] Temetre: These clips really remind me of how much better the combat was back in the day.
[0:39:13] welladjustedx: @koolerjake EFT has been my favorite game, but you're not wrong- sadly
[0:39:17] poeticile: I mean...the reality though is mixed with the crazy armor + high skill ceiling, game was bleeding new players nonstop though

[0:40:28] benny_potato: like its made to be close to simulator, so if they want shields like warzone go play cod, give me example of gigachad who takes so many bullets and still walk and shoot
[0:40:32] dmskrtaes: PogChamp
[0:40:32] B3KA: but isnt that because he's low level or no?
[0:40:35] WrinkledBallBag: thats so terrible
[0:40:35] pepohead: yeah it's that bad
[0:40:35] Temetre: @cancerous_reply Ive playe Tarkov for >3 Years. The gameplay of those last wipes is 100% worse. Jiggle peaking is better than the garbage we got now.

[0:41:30] nib__rl: prepopping painkillers is mandatory because of the stamina drain, you're forced to stand still without it
[0:41:30] abeester: bad aim
[0:41:31] abeester: KEKW

[0:42:06] Nora_Alter: true PepeLaugh
[0:42:08] lyfeofbeingk: brainded
[0:42:09] BallsyGG: its the ads and the aim punch i think is his point \
[0:42:10] DopeReefer: these clips are just about armor tho
[0:42:11] czekm8: that was .45 fmj which doesnt do shit

[0:42:20] itzBlaZn: Watched Klean watch this last night, interesting to see your perspective
[0:42:22] I_aM_Pseudo: AKs are so bad till you can dump a mill into them
[0:42:25] DonDaBiscuit: aiming is terrible in modern tarkov
[0:42:25] welladjustedx: @Temetre don't gotta tell me bro, i have 6K hours in game lmao
[0:42:26] AnotherArchon: But the point is that 1/6 clips is like the clips before!!!!!!!!!
[0:42:26] vilzu150: its just random aimpunch tho and both of them are blind
[0:42:34] poogyboy: looks to be like a skill issue Kappa
[0:42:35] gutbuster117: smg btw lol
[0:42:35] definitelynotak: !AK
[0:42:36] SAKIZONE: heshe's not very good too

[0:42:37] Handaa_: @I_aM_Pseudo facts
[0:42:38] pepohead: yeah its aimpunch and shit not so much the length of the fights
[0:42:40] Sa1yanZ: think he's mosly just commenting on camera recoil and how terrible it is to aim rn in this game
[0:42:40] Scream1e: He plays like hes playing COD or something
[0:42:41] Jmontast1c: spray and "pray"
[0:42:44] Clawstorm_: He's got a clean setup though

[0:43:01] Temetre: @Ramtho It basically is
[0:43:02] AnotherArchon: But the point is that 1/6 clips is like the clips before!!!!!!!!!
[0:43:03] NovaNox144: @scream1e, what do you mean
[0:43:04] mariuszenigma: PepegaAim
[0:43:13] monsnow: Isnt like 90% of this clip is basically a bug? Thats the only tarkov problem. Theres a lot of bullet that didnt get registered here.
[0:43:15] LegaIizeRanch: he got semi tapped by a guy while he was sprint jumping around and spraying
[0:43:17] VenomVeinV: idk what this guy wants to shoot people for 10 mins er what
[0:43:19] Clawstorm_: bro ran away from cover lmao
[0:43:20] gutbuster117: the stam drain
[0:43:22] I_aM_Pseudo: That was tracer round? That's high tier ammo
[0:43:22] DUTCHY_ZA: i once jump shot a terrorist and its the reason im here today
[0:43:24] BakinPacman: i do feel that prone should help with recoil alot
[0:43:25] janissary_hsn: this guy keeps moving while shooting what does he expect. arcade game?
[0:43:26] H5TERiA: its the stamina drain
[0:43:26] abeester: yea, this video is buttcheeks
[0:43:29] trollul: It was about aim punch, stamina drain etc
[0:43:30] ssslyder: bless the hip-fire meta
[0:43:32] nib__rl: true
[0:43:33] Under_Growth: It points out how useless armor which is one of his points
[0:43:34] 0xygenhomie: u ever got shot before? Kappa
[0:43:34] seal45: yeah allot of these clips shoulnd't be in the video
[0:43:35] dreadmunky03: Hello! Shroud, only saw you on youtube videos, i just started using twitch today!
[0:43:37] itsmeJmac: @RebelFoxtrot he can call whatever he wants reality cant change his ability
[0:43:40] lyfeofbeingk: vampiree mechanics
[0:43:40] qtVEIN: @shroud why dont you play tarkov anymore then?
[0:43:41] TheKillaKhaled: @abeester make a single counter argument KEKW
[0:43:43] definitelynotak: damn drain
[0:43:43] speytz: Shot trough the lung will drain ur stamina IRL
[0:43:45] AnotherArchon: he would have been able to run!!!!!
[0:43:45] lazlow_1: should go down but not all of it
[0:43:46] WrinkledBallBag: i think hes just talking about the combat in general
[0:43:47] VladuFTW: @shroud should go UP instead because of adrenaline
[0:43:51] RebelFoxtrot: @itsmeJmac LUL dude would destroy you.
[0:43:52] itzBlaZn: Adrenaline would kick in no?
[0:43:53] amoguscocker: Not winning 100% of the time = game bad OMEGALUL
[0:43:55] Aloomiii: that's way too fast
[0:43:56] OostBlockBoys: @speytz what kinda dumass comment is that, tarkov is not irl
[0:43:57] chl7walomaydi3: try lost light
[0:43:57] mazu001: surely if you got shot, your stam would go down no?
[0:43:58] Scream1e: Dont run in Tarkov
[0:43:58] definitelynotak: system train
[0:43:58] maddogs_world: tell me you wnat realism but not give us realism
[0:44:00] HandTV: That clip on Interchange was to emphasize the point of being 2-tapped by BT through level 5.  Armor doesn't seem to protect you.
[0:44:02] metaphour: these are high risk situations tho...
[0:44:04] definitelynotak: ed
[0:44:04] Nisl: when you get shot IRL your stam goes up not down, it's called adrenaline.
[0:44:08] Lawman74: Devs never heard of adrenaline....
[0:44:08] lyfeofbeingk: it should be heart rate instead of stamina
[0:44:09] ssslyder: @amoguscocker Pepega
[0:44:12] Thrillz_: making everything like irl doesn't make it a fun game lol
[0:44:19] NovaNox144: @amoguscocker, if that's unironically what you're taking away from this then idk what to tell you
[0:44:23] RebelFoxtrot: Chat has no ability to understand long explanations and points being made. They see clip, they react to clip..
[0:44:25] GlutenFreeVapes: What do you mean, what else is there?

[0:44:35] hackinglove: true shroud PETPET
[0:44:39] Ryo_39: getting up from prone killed his bar there
[0:44:59] Yumpone: what would u do instead of a bar tho? Oo i actually cant think of one :D
[0:45:08] ThyDeadeye: getting shot should give you an adrenaline boost not take stamina down
[0:45:15] amoguscocker: @novamaenox most of the moronic changes in this game happened because streamers cried for it, so yeah, fck him
[0:45:15] monsnow: @Nisl Adrenaline is not a stamina, its a reaction from ur brain.   When you got shot IRL you basically cant run at all.
[0:45:20] itscrazydoog: recoil needs to get fixed
[0:45:21] KontrolStyle: tis long one NODDERS
[0:45:23] GlutenFreeVapes: BRUH
[0:45:26] cptwhoopass1: just give us better load times I'll be happy
[0:45:26] TrixieKat: the ending is the best part @shroud
[0:45:34] miill0: TEHNICALLY Game is still in BETA KEKW
[0:45:36] xer0b1t: if they got rid of the initial recoil it would be fine, the initial recoil is absolutely insane
[0:45:42] seal45: whats the point of naming things he wish he put in the video?
[0:45:43] OlsargeTV: raids? mythic vault?
[0:45:43] prateekdoteen: 40mints still he is more tilted 🤣 LUL

[0:45:54] PimpsNotSimps_: @rdvnv 6 year beta btw
[0:45:58] smiiik: bro is mad
[0:46:00] maddogs_world: @rdvnv as is any game they don't want to completely release becuase they change the way its fabricated
[0:46:00] KontrolStyle: hahaha
[0:46:03] NovaNox144: @amoguscocker, ;)
[0:46:04] Lawman74: @monsnow You should research on more what adrenaline is.
[0:46:05] OostBlockBoys: @itzBlaZn devs listening to klean is the reason for these shit changes
[0:46:05] B3KA: @shroud what if they make it so u can only take painkillers if you're in pain

[0:46:37] Sa1yanZ: gaming community doesn;t deserve Veritas. man's doing gods work
[0:46:37] atromere: adrenaline system would be awesome.  seems like they have the opposite of that right now and rely on pre-paining which suuuucks

[0:50:07] MrStormFlex: It feels like GAMBLING 50 50
[0:50:08] DunningCougar: The recoil problem is the worst of all of them, makes it too much RNG
[0:50:08] Ragin_Saiyan: a hard coin flip at that
[0:50:10] pLemiel: the only problem in tarkov is i dont see any players and always gets one tapped

[0:51:03] Xaker167: Don't play 24/7 and you not gonna be eshausted
[0:51:03] LegaIizeRanch: yeah idk i feel like theres a lot to learn from losses, even if theres randomness in the recoil
[0:51:04] NovaNox144: @imsunborne, there's a bit more nuance to it, it's not either completely RNG or a competitive Esports
[0:51:04] jakebot: i like veritas but this sounds like someone who is seriously burnt out from playing 10,000 hours and should just play something else for a while
[0:51:07] RebelFoxtrot: @oxygenhomie I think you have a really hard time understanding nuance in the english language, and how to take in a point that might take 5 minutes to make.
[0:51:08] BeepsBPS: @Mr_Tundra22 Hell yeah!
[0:51:08] poogyboy: COPIUM true
[0:51:08] janissary_hsn: what i like abt tarkov is closest to irl experience. not skill based games. in irl positioning is the utmost important rhing.

[0:51:24] monsnow: This is EFT reddit type of post, "I'll leave the game" and back within the few days.
[0:51:26] nib__rl: @DelahoussayeTV ^ completely missed the point.
[0:51:29] Hazzard_tv: nah thats what happens with every game
[0:51:29] TanethFPS: @shiftix_____ more like controller AA leverage
[0:51:31] sssnic: He has valid points but if he summaries with “i just hope they listen you me or I’ll leave” it ruins the message

[0:54:28] yararetai: damn scopes were actually seeable
[0:54:28] abeester: so guns were lasers back then?
[0:54:34] l0fii_: watch the vid , that first 4 minutes are literally about how cod is more tactical and realistic.
[0:54:36] flu3ncy: [____]
[0:54:42] DonDaBiscuit: @abeester guns are lasers irl at those distances
[0:54:42] Nora_Alter: @yararetai ikr KEKW
[0:54:43] nib__rl: @cancerous_reply The rifles shouldn't kick like a mule, its dumb from a gameplay POV and a logical POV
[0:54:45] Pekter: [__] love that
[0:54:49] SOLIDFPS: those were meta m4 builds iirc
[0:54:54] promemer227: true
[0:54:56] sssnic: Exactly #
[0:54:57] MikeMegaMildMojo: not at all

[0:55:02] nib__rl: @ImSunborne OMEGALUL
[0:55:02] NovaNox144: we need a middleground
[0:55:03] Sr_reX: Agreed
[0:55:04] ProHdawg: YEP
[0:55:04] WrinkledBallBag: middle
[0:55:04] JohnDoeRadio: yeah
[0:55:04] mazu001: True
[0:55:04] InnerKonflict: yes, i dont want laser m4 to come back.
[0:55:05] mascapaia: balance
[0:55:05] Ciraya_: they need a middle ground
[0:55:05] ronfondle: happy medium
[0:55:06] 0PYR3X: EXACTLY
[0:55:06] menumitch: some middle ground yeah
[0:55:06] BakinPacman: healing while moving is kinda ehhhh but it can be required
[0:55:06] Ciraya_: AGREE
[0:55:07] Snukki: knaDyppaHopeep
[0:55:07] ScorchedR: the recoil looks better at leats
[0:55:07] netFliQz_: no .. its cod tarkov .. wtf
[0:55:08] PimpsNotSimps_: speak 4 ya self
[0:55:08] promemer227: yep exactly
[0:55:08] welladjustedx: What it is now is LESS than what we want tho, compared to this
[0:55:09] Lawman74: YEP
[0:55:09] ladskius: old recoil + inertia
[0:55:09] HandTV: It emphasizes points that can be better than what they are now
[0:55:10] qtVEIN: take parts of each side
[0:55:10] Jacksteri: Some fine tuning :p
[0:55:10] syhkoe: a inbetween for sure
[0:55:11] 5haun: its never gonna be perfect Sadge
[0:55:11] 0PYR3X: EXACTLY BALANCE THINGS UP
[0:55:12] HostiPl: agree
[0:55:13] ChiefK1ng: they can keep inertia. They just need to bring back the recoil how it used to be
[0:55:14] Cpt_SpicyWeiner: E Z
[0:55:14] B3KA: is tarkov ever going to be open world?
[0:55:15] Nora_Alter: exactly KEKW
[0:55:16] qtVEIN: old recoil + intertia
[0:55:16] giitzz: not easy to find tho
[0:55:16] Shipsternz: prone out of raids coz it was good doesnt make sence
[0:55:16] Coup3dUp: @abeester Recoil was much more balanced with skill upgrades
[0:55:17] nymerjack: 12.11 was that line @shroud
[0:55:17] Jimmyltd: @SOLIDFPS they were, when the new attachments came out
[0:55:18] iDanorii: somewhere between. tweak how much weight effects you, tweak inertia
[0:55:18] costcohotdawg: HACKERMANS
[0:55:19] Xaker167: Why this guy is not playing COD instead ?
[0:55:20] Cosbyy: it's like cs 1.6 vs cs source players
[0:55:20] Dragons952: bawkHm
[0:55:20] Snukki: Just give back recoil and sound, and some good scopes KEKW
[0:55:21] Canadian_Luke: They keep making it harder for newer players
[0:55:21] gutbuster117: recoil needs to be better but internia need to be in the game
[0:55:22] Jmontast1c: its still "beta"
[0:55:22] yaashs: This is a little COD'y
[0:55:22] mazu001: COD-OV
[0:55:22] not_that_ethan: this recoil we are all shooting laser guns
[0:55:22] quanion: spooiler: they wont
[0:55:23] Cpt_SpicyWeiner: SO E Z
[0:55:25] rodriguezgerardo: True this feels like cod
[0:55:25] cloakzy: looks like COD gameplay rn
[0:55:25] Nora_Alter: i mean its 7 years alrdy and still in beta so LUL
[0:55:26] PeepTheSheepie: @BakinPacman No healing animations is not what they're talking about LUL
[0:55:26] LameMen: they just need to add good recoil to the game imo
[0:55:27] Budgt: nah they wont
[0:55:28] xxaltarxx: I like it where it is now I just want to run it more than 15 fps KEKW
[0:55:29] tprodigy4655: Yeah cuz recoil truly is just total ass all around like most guns feel completely unused me
[0:55:30] grumpygawwd: Play with Veritas he's on!
[0:55:30] TitanxAU: the game just needs more viability in a large range of guns and armour and ammo
[0:55:30] pepohead: i don't think anyone is wanting exactly old tarkov, but when compared to now it had alot more positives
[0:55:33] Budgt: They never will
[0:55:33] not_that_ethan: even CoD has more recoil
[0:55:34] ssslyder: another 10 years of beta KEKW
[0:55:34] TanethFPS: same thing happend to the cycle. only sweats playing it like its COD.
[0:55:35] syhkoe: happens when its 3 russian guys in a basement
[0:55:36] selfftp: @cloakzy hahahha
[0:55:42] SandySamuel: then they need to remove the weight system, which wont happen because realism
[0:55:43] jinxaur: its the 1 tap headshot that kills it
[0:55:44] ImSunborne: damn even cloak is saying it just looks like cod
[0:55:46] TheMindTerrorist: If I wanted to play COD I would play COD, Tarkov is not supposed to be a arcade shooter
[0:55:47] lgnashevich: LUL
[0:55:48] hackinglove: peepoDJ pepeJAM peepoDJ
[0:55:48] mascapaia: LUL
[0:55:49] knear2: what changed?
[0:55:51] kolas_b: drop shots KEKW
[0:55:53] 0xygenhomie: he wants an arcadey tarkov.. drop shotting ppl
[0:55:57] AmazeJ: that flop should be in the game
[0:56:02] janissary_hsn: let some games be highly realistic🤦‍♂️
[0:56:05] Ciraya_: @oxygenhomie did you even watch the video dude?
[0:56:06] monsnow: Nah, they just need to focus on BUG and cheat, if thats get minimized then they can determined which direction they are going to.
[0:56:07] Schmax: fal meta Kreygasm
[0:56:08] MikeMegaMildMojo: cod or eft?

[0:56:15] BeepsBPS: Yum!
[0:56:20] callmeb0x: 4 years of watching on this account. 2 year badge shroudY shroudFC
[0:56:21] maddogs_world: Here is also my thought about it. This waould also go well into Match making in a way. All PMC's have a level to them. What would help teh game maintain it's element is depending on what you do, fire fights or missions, you can train and learn different weapon handling between different weapons.
[0:56:22] 0sama___: is this a br game ?
[0:56:23] hackinglove: head shot reckH
[0:56:23] ScaryBerry: @oxygenhomie LUL LUL
[0:56:24] 0PYR3X: THAT ERGO
[0:56:26] DonDaBiscuit: @oxygenhomie lol way more realistic than a 300 lb athsma pmc with noodle arms
[0:56:27] itsmeJmac: @TheMindTerrorist people dont understand that, they want other games to be like other games they like
[0:56:28] jotanie: i think people just want the pace of the game to not be slowed bc of arbitrary  systems
[0:56:35] PudPo: Is Shroud playing WoW today

[0:56:48] 0xygenhomie: he must be showing these clips for no reason then, sorry chat
[0:56:49] iDanorii: also i dont get the armor argument. with nerfed ammo, good armor is better than its ever been
[0:56:49] ScaryBerry: VAL gamers

[0:57:31] PeepTheSheepie: At least it was fun
[0:57:35] ChiefK1ng: @ultimatekc_ yeah you're right. Plus the weight system was as bad as it is now
[0:57:37] Coup3dUp: This looks PRE weight system
[0:57:39] welladjustedx: The servers can't keep up with the old movement tho lol
[0:57:39] Cpt_SpicyWeiner: thats arcady as hell
[0:57:39] ItzSpiffie: yeah before bullets took ur stam lmao
[0:57:40] iAmSpacedOut: factory used to be 1 of my fav maps

[0:57:41] 0PYR3X: HEAL WHILE SHOOTING qtcDeadge
[0:57:42] TheMindTerrorist: @itsmeJmac That doesn't make any sense. What is the point then in making a new game if it's going to be exactly the same as other games in same genre?
[0:57:44] WrinkledBallBag: the days of healing and shooting LUL
[0:57:45] InnerKonflict: when arena comes out, they have to take a relooksie at gun balance and gear balance anyway since its pvp compeititve @shroud

[0:57:46] salami_goblin: Have you ever played the metro games @shroud?
[0:57:47] RebelFoxtrot: Old MP5 recoil Kreygasm
[0:57:50] JohnDoeRadio: i think the main point is having some sort of control, but not like cod total skates. or even half what cod is.
[0:57:51] noseguy1: this doesn't even look good I'm confused does he want to go back to this from what tarkov currently is?
[0:57:53] PimpsNotSimps_: @ChiefK1ng there was no weight system
[0:57:53] NovaNox144: @amoguscocker, you dont play either games apparently

[0:57:59] Jacksteri: bullet sponges OMEGALUL
[0:58:01] jinxaur: shooting blanks
[0:58:01] GlutenFreeVapes: Part of the issue is that most people play tarkov on lowest settings, 200% saturation, some even 4:3 stretched, aiming guns is too easy, it's no problem 1 tapping heads like that
[0:58:02] itsmeJmac: @TheMindTerrorist facts
[0:58:06] iSm1lez: LULW
[0:58:08] Raein91: Why are these clips in the video??

[0:58:09] Inline66: ahhh yess 30 bullets and guy still isnt dead
[0:58:09] twizzle_dk: what if Tark off and pub G devs combined forces
[0:58:10] DonDaBiscuit: it was skill based at least. not a coin flip
[0:58:11] Harry_PotHead420BlazeIt: 9mm gaming?
[0:58:11] Nora_Alter: he sure sprays alot KEKW
[0:58:16] iDanorii: bro this is an awful clip to include lmao
[0:58:16] ChiefK1ng: @ChiefK1ng I'm talking the patch prior to inertia even when there was a weight system. but you right
[0:58:17] SOLIDFPS: I hated the RPG stats in that era of tarkov, you didnt really have COD movement until you had max strength or w/e, then ppl were sprint jump peeking like maniacs LUL
[0:58:17] M1chael: Mag dumping PepegaAim
[0:58:21] sssnic: Like that clip, that can’t be at all what the devs were hoping for at any point in the game’s life
[0:58:22] hackinglove: i like that win it can move fast HACKERMANS
[0:58:27] kickedmidget: @Raein91 Reminiscing duhh

[0:58:32] I_aM_Pseudo: some of these fights look like people slapping other people with wallets instead of skill
[0:58:35] LegaIizeRanch: @DonDaBiscuit top players must be really good at flipping coins
[0:58:36] LuisNoLimit: @GlutenFreeVapes graphics settings = insta aimbot headshots delusional

[0:59:04] Vinncentgg: I mean yea sure, but Nikita sad like 10 thousnd times its his game and he doesnt care about others opinion and still im sad too, that this game is going wrong direction. Im suprised he's talking about the soldiers and stuff, but as u start a wipe u are like normal person without any skills in combat etc. I would love to see Veritas run with 60 kg backpack right now
[0:59:04] DonDaBiscuit: @LegaIizeRanch nah theyre just good at abusing desync

[0:59:09] gutbuster117: fuck bloom
[0:59:10] jinxaur: no bloom. bounce the gun
[0:59:11] welladjustedx: gonna piss EVERYONE off with that
[0:59:11] iDanorii: nahhhhh, i was always in the boat that recoil legitimately wasnt a problem EXCEPT meta aks / m4s, so nerf attachments
[0:59:11] not_that_ethan: thats worse in a fps tbh
[0:59:12] gutbuster117: no bloom
[0:59:12] impurex: you want csgo
[0:59:13] okaberintarou_okarin: I am new so I want to ask..y spraying is not a thing in this game
[0:59:13] UntouchableOfficial: nah fuck bloom, just lower recoil to a more fair amount
[0:59:13] Shokwave2k: nope skill based, not luck based

[0:59:18] V1rtuou5: @shroud that would infuriate people more, like BF2042 shooting
[0:59:18] rato_de_esgoto88: @Cosbyy better than recoil.
[0:59:18] bamfasaur: we have a whole arm stamina bar why not implement that into the recoil
[0:59:19] sprCircuit: like valorant vandal
[0:59:19] DanielTTK2: @shroud That's how contract wars was, the game tarkov made b4 tarkov

[0:59:25] dylan622: there is no point of Semi auto atm
[0:59:25] valrash1981: Where ever that muzzle is pointing is where that bullet is going.
[0:59:26] LameMen: why not an intense naked pubg gun recoil? @shroud
[0:59:26] Crankt_: if only this game was single player Clueless
[0:59:26] CHR1XX: but aint that what recoil does anyway?
[0:59:26] PimpsNotSimps_: over your head nobody wants rng
[0:59:27] rockyman797: i like bullet go where barrel is pointed not bloom
[0:59:27] Yvirten: bloom is horrible.
[0:59:27] HermesGrey: that would be good imo,
[0:59:29] buckmeat: fuck the guy who invented bloom
[0:59:30] RebelFoxtrot: Not how real guns work, and you know this game wants authentic guns.
[0:59:30] iAmSpacedOut: so like the recoil gets higher the more you hold down?
[0:59:31] Cosbyy: @cancerous_reply how? bloom is random?
[0:59:32] KeysTv__: nahh bloom isbad fr
[0:59:34] HermesGrey: how things work irl

[0:59:41] Drolyx: KEKW
[0:59:42] Under_Growth: @shroud DIdn't you used to say you despised bloom in battlefield though
[0:59:42] TitanxAU: watch trey's video, he has a good point at the end of it for recoil
[0:59:42] Hangwires: yes
[0:59:43] kasper11996: this is cod recoil, no recoil LUL
[0:59:43] FetusMeatloaf: yes

[0:59:46] ssslyder: can you buy BSG ??  please
[0:59:47] ayammasin: yea
[0:59:47] yararetai: camera recoil just needs to be taken away
[0:59:48] H5TERiA: PSO ak spray lol
[0:59:48] dannyx27: that's like random recoil. can't really learn controll if you don't know where your bullets are going to go
[0:59:48] thenamesshane: yes this recoil
[0:59:48] KeysTv__: YESS this recoil over bloom
[0:59:50] Kiuum: Controled recoil is better than bloom
[0:59:50] MeestahJahn: i hate how we cant spray with an acog with out seeing blqck cor the first 8 bullets
[0:59:50] jinxaur: yes recoil now is good
[0:59:51] SteadyOP: I think they just tune down recoil
[0:59:52] NotHyx: Old recoil new movement
[0:59:52] twizzle_dk: current recoil trash
[0:59:56] Drolyx: I love seeing the ceiling when I shoot
[0:59:57] mascapaia: old recoil is 4Head
[0:59:58] Weldzz_: you cant do anything about bloom but you can do something about recoil, be better
[1:00:02] Borbaaaa: 10% less recoil gg
[1:00:04] DonDaBiscuit: @kasper11996 so you never shot guns irl? its how it is
[1:00:05] LameMen: i just want pubg recoil in everything
[1:00:05] Crankt_: @ssslyder Pog top tier idea
[1:00:07] giitzz: this recoil x5 over some fortnite bloom
[1:00:08] not_that_ethan: this AI is bad tho
[1:00:08] Raein91: @shroud Why are these clips in the video??
[1:00:08] Alaziara: If this was current guards you'd be head/eyes'd already
[1:00:09] ZudoL_: i dont mind it, honestly I like how it is, IMO
[1:00:09] amatripsis: hey
[1:00:10] rageteletubbie: rng bloom is no fun
[1:00:10] afk47: what recoil is broken now who said its good now ?
[1:00:10] thedirtyd16: Trey24k put up a good short video for recoil change
[1:00:11] FetusMeatloaf: even this recoil is more than a lot of fps games
[1:00:11] azzawraths: this recoil much better then right now
[1:00:11] Commandant_Steel: pre 12.12 patch was better cos it was more fun.
[1:00:11] JohnDoeRadio: it looks shitty af but it really wasnt that bad other than a few guns
[1:00:11] valrash1981: This recoil over cod mechanics.
[1:00:13] Ciraya_: Old Recoil with a more balanced Inertia system and weight
[1:00:15] Cpt_SpicyWeiner: this recoil is like bf2042 .. all the same for all the guns @shroud
[1:00:16] wimgonee: old recoil and nerf ammo
[1:00:17] phxarcher: ???
[1:00:19] StreamElements: Subscribe to my second YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmteEZzq7A2qVtXPMeYhAHg/videos

[1:00:20] picklericki: dude spraying 50 m62 to someones thorax with 0 recoil
[1:00:20] kasper11996: @DonDaBiscuit I never shot a gun irl
[1:00:21] ChiefK1ng: @Alaziara true
[1:00:22] NovaNox144: current recoil is random af
[1:00:24] Hangwires: nah tarkov aint fortnite
[1:00:25] realsmile: no one likes bloom
[1:00:27] LuisNoLimit: wait i like that
[1:00:28] ssslyder: old recoil was like cod shit  ( no recoil )
[1:00:29] sssnic: oH hEs CooKEd
[1:00:29] xxaltarxx: I mean certain guns I think should have less recoil like the AR's but overall it's more realistic you just don't hold mouse one
[1:00:31] oCallMeViper: monkaHmm
[1:00:32] Ciraya_: current recoil is literally a slot machine
[1:00:32] vvACvv: Skill based recoil > rng recoil
[1:00:33] TheHappyBunny: like a real gun when spray a full 30 mag
[1:00:33] Hangwires: its a no
[1:00:33] PWNut: That’s called MOA we have that
[1:00:36] Koffiekoekje: Wtf is that note on the AK LUL
[1:00:36] MrFray1: Like in world of tanks Kappa
[1:00:38] PimpsNotSimps_: ah yes more rng! you get it entirely !
[1:00:39] rodriguezgerardo: That doesn’t sound fun lmao
[1:00:40] WhyYeIl: @shroud guns work like this IRL, barrel flex rounds don''t hit exactly on the reticle
[1:00:42] Sikkab: NODDERS
[1:00:42] PeepTheSheepie: @ssslyder Almost like irl
[1:00:43] Hangwires: Minute of Angle
[1:00:46] TanethFPS: logical
[1:00:46] DonDaBiscuit: @kasper11996 modern guns are all lasers. up to a good amount of distance
[1:00:46] olipezin: it's my refile shroud
[1:00:46] HostiPl: like in squad
[1:00:47] BakinPacman: people were mostly mad at stuff like killa slides etc but that is mostly due to the sound issues of no noise until he already kills you LUL\
[1:00:47] rolandswarzone: wwwwww
[1:00:47] goatt420: this guy is wathcing u on twitch rn @shroud
[1:00:47] netFliQz_: true
[1:00:48] 10skywalker10: its not like pubg
[1:00:49] tusky_tusky_: when does the arena version of tarkov come out?
[1:00:49] whollaaa: What a dog shit idea
[1:00:49] Nick0414: this recoil and more recent old recoil is boring af.
[1:00:49] syhkoe: yes
[1:00:49] Inline66: they should just tune everything back a bit. we dont need laser beams but current recoil is way to much
[1:00:50] tprodigy4655: Honestly if they just cut the recoil across the board by like 30% it would fix a lot
[1:00:51] rato_de_esgoto88: @realsmile do you like recoil? better than having your entire screen shake and not see enemy cus of a fucking recoil that cant be replicated like it is irl
[1:00:52] 0xygenhomie: i dont understand these clips if ppl are saying "did you watch the video"
[1:00:52] LegaIizeRanch: thats basically how it is now
[1:00:52] dannyx27: so tap firing at distance stays accurate?
[1:00:54] Dunkin_3: basically wants that csgo shooting
[1:00:54] Koffiekoekje: O wait that's his overlay
[1:00:55] menumitch: itd be better than what we have now
[1:00:55] giitzz: easier said then done tho
[1:00:55] Crankt_: bursting would never work at distance unless you have a laser
[1:00:56] zTreino_xD: Way make ez ? Kappa
[1:00:57] hackinglove: yes i like that shroud monkaHmm
[1:00:57] ShadesReign: Suppression on BF3 did that for a time and it made competitive feel awful
[1:01:00] olipezin: -_-
[1:01:02] ZionCzan: but what about when they and LMGs that are made for long range full auto combat
[1:01:03] zTreino_xD: why
[1:01:04] Tha_Sneakery: Like the RPK in Warzone now its better the way suggest it m8
[1:01:07] vvACvv: it would be = as bad
[1:01:07] ThomasYuhh: Like DAYZ
[1:01:08] blissfulrubly: shroud can u play some radiohead
[1:01:08] mascapaia: kind of a CS or Val sprays?
[1:01:09] RebelFoxtrot: They had that in BF1... and got rid of it in BFV
[1:01:11] VchecK: the point of tarkov is realism, you shouldnt be memorizing recoil patterns
[1:01:12] Jacksteri: Notice how you can hold angles?
[1:01:13] zulufoxtrotttv: thats in the game already its called MOA its an IRL thing too
[1:01:14] gh0stblake: Should be less recoil if you wait till full ADS ( like a strong grip on the weapon) vs mid ads should he higher recoil (like hip fire)
[1:01:16] quanion: i thought they did research and shit about real life guns. the way the recoil is rn is completely unrealistic
[1:01:16] littlesausageroll: more speed but keep the inertia changes
[1:01:17] DanielTTK2: @shroud It's def a solution but I think toning things down is the way, less recoil, less obstructive shake but try to mantain that realistic or chaos feel while allowing for skill to be prevelant
[1:01:17] bamfasaur: we have a whole arm stamina bar why not implement that into the recoil @shroud
[1:01:19] Akitake: chat is an eyesore
[1:01:23] xs1eepyy: why do you think pubg died @shroud
[1:01:23] CaptainDrunk: Blooming is like, RNG from BSgames, we surely don;t wanna do that xD
[1:01:24] ssslyder: @PeepTheSheepie yeah but you cant have old recoil with now days health and  gear system
[1:01:24] Xaker167: zero recoil, insta heal, fast movement, this is just stupid imo.
[1:01:27] Harry_PotHead420BlazeIt: but the zoom zooms want to full spray 200m
[1:01:27] Crankt_: @VchecK nobody is saying you should LUL
[1:01:28] iDanorii: old val shroudHug
[1:01:30] ToasterBrutal: look at your spray in the new gun range, full auto meta is still bloomed a bit
[1:01:30] maddogs_world: The problem with that shroud is people will end up just getting a mod that makes single fire act like full auto and they have perfect aim and lazer people, just like COD's issue
[1:01:34] PeepTheSheepie: @VchecK And the current recoil is realistic LUL
[1:01:38] darl1ck: they just need to remove the rng from recoils etc
[1:01:40] SloyFPS: !chair
[1:01:40] Skadakar: LMGs are area effect, so even at 70% accurate the volume makes it viable
[1:01:40] StreamElements: @SloyFPS, he is using the Embody Gaming Chair from Herman Miller x Logitech https://bit.ly/HMxLogitech (With a Herman Miller Eames in the background)
[1:01:41] realsmile: @cancerous_reply No one said tarkov recoil is good, im just saying no one likes bloom. dont be pressed :)
[1:01:42] BakinPacman: bipods could be interesting NGL
[1:01:42] ShadesReign: @FartShockWave There was a pretty huge competitive scene on bf3 dude
[1:01:44] valrash1981: @ZionCzan Not supposed to shoulder carry lmg and be accurate full auto.
[1:01:47] SteadyOP: would be nice if bipods actually worked
[1:01:48] MrPhoNoodle: what about old pubg recoil?
[1:01:49] afk47: yeah go prone and lose half stamina lets go
[1:01:50] GreenStr33t: lmg is an area gun
[1:01:52] oCallMeViper: LMAO RAMBO
[1:01:53] applesaus4K: TLDR for the vid: veritas is trash right now and always has been, he just got away with more back in the day because the game allowed it. @shroud you're welcome.
[1:01:57] Raein91: @shroud have you played "Project Reality"?
[1:01:58] hawtic: LMG's are meant for fire suppression not accuracy
[1:01:59] Koffiekoekje: I loved it a lot in BF3
[1:01:59] ImSunborne: like CoD currently KEKW stupid ass RPK
[1:02:00] xxaltarxx: you think of Tarkov in a very Arcady way which I don't think this is what this game is about
[1:02:00] Dragons952: quackSmile so the story is that I started blasting
[1:02:01] VchecK: it's a spectrum. @PeepTheSheepie @Crankt_ theres a big diff between memorizing recoil patterns and compete fortnite b loom , lol
[1:02:02] DaWeed_974: LUL
[1:02:02] zTreino_xD: Turret
[1:02:02] PimpsNotSimps_: 5 min later? wym
[1:02:06] RebelFoxtrot: @applesaus4K L take.
[1:02:07] kitsat: lmgs are used more for supression vs long ranged accurate shots
[1:02:08] mcpeppercino: mcpeppercino subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[1:02:09] Crankt_: @applesaus4K you sounds really mad
[1:02:09] sum1machine: rambo mode
[1:02:09] mascapaia: Pog
[1:02:11] Cliche_AF: @applesaus4k herro
[1:02:11] sssnic: But is this game ever gonna go back to the gameplay hes showing in this montage? Never
[1:02:12] kopraokse: lmgs are more like meant to do suppresivefire anyways, they aint accurate
[1:02:14] BigDaz72: LUL
[1:02:17] mascapaia: that was cool
[1:02:17] GlutenFreeVapes: BatChest get destroyed
[1:02:19] slavdope: LUL
[1:02:19] AlmaPerdido: theres literally only 1 lmg in the game atm
[1:02:21] wangchukn: ur vid
[1:02:21] vvACvv: thats kinda how trey24k was talking about in his newest video with changing recoil @shroud
[1:02:23] TrashPandacoot: gaem bad, roger
[1:02:23] Inline66: also fix armor. dont need one taps but not bullet sponges either. everything is just too extreme and they need to find the middle ground
[1:02:23] Trivski: Skill over bloom pls
[1:02:27] ShadesReign: @FartShockWave Whatever you say man
[1:02:27] zalciunaz: Like video
[1:02:28] InnerKonflict: @hawtic no. both. depending on caliber, sight and recoi lsystem as well as skill of the operator. kiddo
[1:02:31] hackinglove: spray and pray PepegaAim
[1:02:31] sssnic: Would be cool to watch your older videos

[1:02:36] zTreino_xD: Forspoken ?
[1:02:36] quanion: it is going in the wrong direction
[1:02:37] giitzz: @shroud a bigger issue is how little recoil some guns can get at end game meta making them 100x better than like 95% of the guns
[1:02:37] 0PYR3X: TARKOV JUST NEED A MIDDLE GROUND BETA BEFORE AND NOW @shroud
[1:02:37] PeepTheSheepie: @VchecK An AKM will shoot the same everytime you shoot it irl. Would expect to be able to memorize what its like
[1:02:37] sssnic: YES
[1:02:38] DaWeed_974: watch ur old tarkov video
[1:02:39] ElleHarribel: Game did use to have a lot more potential for player skill
[1:02:40] twi3ta: @applesaus4K Nah tarkov has made some bad changes, recoil is too nuts now.

[1:10:15] sunjo_hsk: i dont care what people say about realism, old tarkov was 100% more fun

[1:10:40] poogyboy: hire u :)
[1:10:41] Crankt_: The Division and Tarkov could be a good mixup IMO (bullet sponges out ofc)

[1:10:55] dummymailbox: Hey @shroud. Unreal Tournament 4 pre alpha is having the servers turned off today. The community did everything to support the game and still Epic is killing the game. Talk about sitting on a goldmine, AFPS will rise again. 1 last blitz shrowdyrowdy?
[1:10:55] cooked_1: if there was more content in dmz it would be fun honestly
[1:10:56] Queenjii: They've got their priorities wrong. They focus on milking the players first and foremost rather than trying to implement great gameplay

[1:11:21] tulapancho2: If something works, dont change it they say hahaha
[1:11:21] Cosbyy: They should make Tarkov how they envision it. Companies look to the player base for how to make their game and they always ruin it that way.

[1:34:28] FatherOwens: @trancefury 100
[1:34:41] Milkman157: @zucroh it wasnt trying to be smite or league more like a mix of the 2. it wasnt bad just on the epic launcher that was its biggest downfall
[1:34:44] novantium: clearly KEK
[1:34:45] XHighHammerX: @cancerous_reply they plan to add paid DLC for new maps and such. Emotes are only the start of this mess

[1:36:03] MikeMegaMildMojo: COPIUM
[1:36:07] xEXARAx: its kinda fucked sometimes but i like it
[1:36:11] maestr0: people need to understand that they have no idea what they’re talking about when they say “this will only take the devs X time”, they don’t know how things work, most of them who say that have never game developed in their life or are optimistic producers

[1:36:43] Mightyymau5: They basically ruined the game
[1:36:45] RebelFoxtrot: @maestr0 You realize recoil values are just numbers you can change right?
[1:36:58] Dragons952: Someone trying to sound smart by adding some bigger words into that sentence more than needed. bawkLul
[1:37:06] sssnic: Yes the sr-2m ty

[1:37:26] FatherOwens: what changes
[1:37:31] Shakeron: I want to start playing Tarkov just because of loot
[1:37:37] Surlaw1_: @shroud elaborate
[1:37:38] SlayedyBug: fix all those problems and we stilll will be spawning next to eachother :(
[1:37:39] sogrubegroj_: So you want recoil that is a bit lets randomized and more seed based so your brain can train muscle memory, i mean its doable.
[1:38:03] chuy4sknn: Hey shroud 👉👈
[1:38:03] nuclearcarmah: @therathuntr Just play the music but keep it low, and make sure something appart from the audio is playing, like your own voice or the game or whatever
[1:38:05] RebelFoxtrot: @sogrubegroj_ Precisely.
[1:38:09] Mightyymau5: 🤓 3000 rpm
[1:38:20] TheKillaKhaled: yea
[1:38:23] StalkmaN: Better recoil ?
[1:38:24] ch3kla: yes
[1:38:25] Basicdope: the less recoil
[1:38:25] kiTTiponX11: YEP
[1:38:26] Kiuum: the less recoil
[1:38:26] jplaguex: ye
[1:38:26] carter_as: the lower the recoil
[1:38:27] iNk_CS: yes
[1:38:28] iDanorii: that is 100% true, yes lower rpms = more accurtae
[1:38:28] quanion: the slower the less recoil
[1:38:31] MikeMegaMildMojo: This guy plays way too much tarkov KEKW
[1:38:33] come0n: 5Head
[1:38:36] mmmowww: arse ass]
[1:38:40] gorpv2: hes saying 762 shouldnt have the same recoil as a 9mm MP5
[1:38:41] Nav22: regardless of ammo size tho
[1:38:47] jackiepockets: do you enjoy mobas at all?
[1:38:47] sssnic: Bsg made that statement that they need to work on things like audio and spawns but when will those things be done? It’s been almost a month since wow and main changes were to limit what ammo we can get from traders
[1:38:47] KodaOTE: no it doesnt
[1:38:48] DaWeed_974: irl too LUL
[1:38:52] Chimerical_Eclipse: kinda but not really - tarkov has a hidden stat called "convergence" that dictates the intitial recoil recovery
[1:38:56] TheRatHuntr: @therathuntr will that work for tarkov if im like not talking constantly?
[1:38:57] Schmax: yeah but less recoil than a mp5 cmon
[1:38:58] BakinPacman: if bullets did the same damage regardless of the caliber in video game sense only
[1:39:00] khatZalasphere: why am I more into this than my actual algebra school work
[1:39:05] jplaguex: BabyRage
[1:39:06] peaq_tv: faster fire = less time to reset between bullets fired
[1:39:10] Playermodd: The ump is the only gun that feels good full auto in eft right now
[1:39:12] SpreazFn: Your my favorite twitch streamer finally found your account
[1:39:33] zagiki: thinking rpm and caliber and not the weapon construction would be main reason for recoil is such gamer way of thinking
[1:39:36] xEXARAx: wait isnt more fire rate it makes spary more accurate?
[1:39:42] SpreazFn: !lurk
[1:39:44] Chimerical_Eclipse: its a combination of factors - weapon recoil, ammo recoil, RPM and convergence rate

[1:42:16] sssnic: Tarkov modded guns irl look crazy
[1:42:21] mascapaia: Pog
[1:42:22] Bevo__: I mean... cool... but its a video game. There are 1000 other things not 100% realistic.
[1:42:24] jackiepockets: league of legends or???????
[1:42:24] zagiki: waiting for someone to explain the recoil with toilet brush
[1:42:25] Nav22: exit
[1:42:28] fallenntv: hes john wick
[1:42:39] SterbenGM: that guy camping extrack
[1:42:40] DaWeed_974: moa
[1:42:41] Sa1yanZ: this is kinda like bloom
[1:42:42] Potatoplayerr: nice range
[1:42:45] chewyapp1e: 🤓
[1:42:47] Chatting0nAaYoinkedPhone: lets go from vertical recoil to complete RNG OMEGALUL
[1:42:48] VenomVeinV: DAJAVU
[1:42:49] kobywanna: holy moly thats jason bourne
[1:42:52] Ayjayyy: @Bevo__ the whole point of this game is its realism
[1:42:53] VenomVeinV: BLOOM LUL
[1:42:57] khatZalasphere: best example of a recoil is when crush doesn't like you back
[1:42:57] sssnic: If i hold my grenade with the pin out indefinitely then the game isnt real enough
[1:43:00] BurpYeah: nice range
[1:43:01] sleepyclair: shroudDab
[1:43:01] StalkmaN: yup
[1:43:03] large_boss: this kinda seems like what the aug is setup as now
[1:43:04] sogrubegroj_: So this is a video game... the idea is that brain has to be able to learn/muscle memory recoil, if its to sparse and random...its just annoying period. You can make it close to reality after all professional shooters use muscles in a certain way etc...
[1:43:06] Sa1yanZ: i mean this is basically what you were saying with bloom @shroud
[1:43:07] Eastern_Cowboy: That is not bloom -_-
[1:43:08] Surlaw1_: the same
[1:43:09] rioterz1: just make the circle bigger when spraying
[1:43:13] BluelightCT: single fire works well
[1:43:13] Flookiee: would still work when spraying, it would just happen faster
[1:43:13] o7General: thats what recoil rng is
[1:43:14] xzTWINzx: same
[1:43:14] oCallMeViper: that is a good point
[1:43:16] Bevo__: Br we also eat too quickly. gotta slow that down. Chewy foods should take longer.
[1:43:20] iambreathtaking: shroudDab
[1:43:26] spr3an: the first few bullets is the biggest problem when spraying in tarkov
[1:43:27] WrinkledBallBag: yeah that doesnt make sense what they are saying here
[1:43:31] gutbuster117: full auto and scope should be not good
[1:43:33] earn: he showed full auto
[1:43:34] StalkmaN: Shroud is right
[1:43:35] Ginovonni: you cant even single fire some guns tho
[1:43:42] Ginovonni: wit hthe dog ver recoil
[1:43:43] Schmax: The problem is the first few shots, also the first one bc its jupmes way too much
[1:43:44] Mokeskii: the guns are modeled so the stock of each gun are not flat against a pmc's shoulder; it didnt used to be like that. veritas talks about it
[1:43:44] sogrubegroj_: I am i would be ok if when you are NOT 100% health your recoil is worse... also low on stamina...but fix the randomness of it.
[1:43:45] deatherdealer: Just use a compound bow.
[1:43:46] KontrolStyle: LUL
[1:43:47] BurpYeah: monkaGIGA
[1:43:48] kiTTiponX11: monkaW
[1:43:48] sk8terpinoy42X: Full Auto No ADS
[1:43:51] Sa1yanZ: tbh single firing in this game is really really bad rn
[1:43:52] KontrolStyle: that's lame
[1:43:52] AndyJyyR: Pubg had a great blend
[1:43:52] flightcomplex: @shroud can you check out Stalcraft? It is a MMO Stalker Shooter that came out recently tons of fun!
[1:43:53] sssnic: Meme or bring issue to light?
[1:43:54] OnlySeanss: when theyre going for realism spraying at most ranges with most weapons is useless no?
[1:43:56] xEXARAx: so they have a single system for recoil to all guns ?
[1:43:57] KontrolStyle: that people are doing that
[1:43:57] quezzas: threats? monkaW
[1:43:57] no_code_: I suspect they wanted slightly longer TTK and messed with recoil instead of ammo armors
[1:43:59] its_npz: wish they just experimented a bit more since they redid everything
[1:44:00] choowastaken: Imagine threatening someone over a video game
[1:44:00] VenomVeinV: or if your holding fire down your screen goes black for your eyes closing LUL JK
[1:44:01] cluelesschemist: SKS recoil is broken thought so semi isn't working either

[1:44:04] nimble_body: tarkov community haHAA
[1:44:04] Playermodd: you hip fire full auto
[1:44:06] RodJavier: hi
[1:44:12] Mokeskii: the game is in a shit state right now you cant deny that
[1:44:12] BakinPacman: i wonder if you just make it so long range scopes make then gun get worse recoil in automatic setups LUL
[1:44:12] Hauspeddler: Is there a dog whining in the background or am I going crazy?
[1:44:13] sssnic: Truuuuuu
[1:44:14] KontrolStyle: it's a game.. sheesh
[1:44:14] StalkmaN: It should be
[1:44:14] Serocity_HD: no cause tapping in tarkov isnt possible you cant single fire guns that can be fire full auto the reset is horrible
[1:44:14] beewweee: react to your twitch rivals vids
[1:44:17] ttvoreoloco: people shooting at docs house like wtf
[1:44:19] Queenjii: random message #221
[1:44:20] Eastern_Cowboy: Threats ... something's wrong with people sending threats like that.
[1:44:21] cChuck_: agree with them or not, threats are pretty childish
[1:44:22] cheka_: @shroud Lirik found the right way to play https://clips.twitch.tv/FlaccidTemperedCougarCclamChamp-mzyles6psXu62F9A
[1:44:23] PIXAXESSS: xD
[1:44:23] kxrlmxddenn: 90% are probbaly bots also xD
[1:44:24] Gorilla_Gluue: this game has been going downhill for a couple wipes now no cap
[1:44:28] Potatoplayerr: Social media are brainrotting for sure
[1:44:35] ParalyzedPosty: sendiong death threats because he make fun of your video game is fucking crazy KKona
[1:44:42] rato_de_esgoto88: because anonimity can do damage, but its also important
[1:44:43] jackiepockets: thoughts on some LoL??????
[1:44:46] hoodride: Sometimes you have to sacrifice realism for balance as well
[1:44:47] synaxYO: that sounds like lazyness LUL
[1:44:48] RyklezzWkey: shroud plau escape from tarkov
[1:44:48] kiTTiponX11: shotgun is the way then KEKW
[1:44:51] shin_hong: YOO what we doing today shroudDance
[1:44:51] Mokeskii: @ParalyzedPosty posty Pog
[1:44:53] sogrubegroj_: How do you feel about recoil getting worse if your stamina is low and you run a lot etc?
[1:44:53] dylan622: regardless of where the game is atm, everyone is on the same playing field
[1:44:55] 2h4rd4u_b2k: @shroud will we see you in PubG in the future ? i love eisenp3lzHERZ this game and they added Vikendi reborn cool map shroudDab
[1:44:56] flightcomplex: You should check out STALCRAFT on steam it is a MMO Shooter that has Stalker elements in it. It just came out recently @shroud
[1:44:57] citrinesoan: hey shroud

[1:45:00] maximiliansz97: Can u play apex legends?
[1:45:00] gnarmander527: @jackiepockets yo chill man i dont think he even plays league anymore
[1:45:00] RiskDreams: @shroud there is no doubt there are some problems that need to be fixed with tarkov but i think these ALPHA players are wayy over the top about it. EFT is still great fun and ag ood time. its just a different game then it used to be. i too would like to see audio and recoil changed but its really not as bad and game breaking as they make it seem
[1:45:00] JackHale: sunfHandsUp sunfHandsUp made in Unity sunfHandsUp sunfHandsUp

[1:45:05] itzBlaZn: I expect internet historian to make would make a video for tarkov eventually no?
[1:45:07] Chatting0nAaYoinkedPhone: making AR so realistic would make it RNG af like come on its a game bruh
[1:45:07] vivisect: Tarkov seems.... verrrry poorly made.
[1:45:10] TheRatHuntr: how you doing shroud been awhile since ive been here
[1:45:12] DefconEngaged: cant chock my recoil if i only use shotty lmao
[1:45:13] rato_de_esgoto88: Squad?
[1:45:14] xEXARAx: thats dumb so lighter weapons with high rpm have the same recoil as heavy ones??
[1:45:16] OnlySeanss: their aim is realism so isnt spraying irl fucked aswell?
[1:45:17] hackinglove: jake modCheck
[1:45:19] rato_de_esgoto88: @shroud some killing floor 2?
[1:45:19] ShinsoXDD: what do u think about destiny 2 :3 specialy next dlc lightfall ?
[1:45:23] MxMuffin: Remember that BSG is not a million dollar company but rather a smaller team so the Ressources are limited
[1:45:23] khatZalasphere: Review destiny 2 guns pls
[1:45:24] GlutenFreeVapes: amybe they should JUST fix the recoil system Clueless
[1:45:28] wbgguy: @shroud do you think a less real tarkov experience with simplified ammo with more like dayz style maps would work?
[1:45:29] MrNappyC6IX: Have you seen frozenheim? @shroud

[1:46:19] NourAGlive: @shroud the new recoil system just for signle guns ?
[1:46:19] Scadarn: The takeaway is that recoil is fundamentally broken in it's implementation
[1:46:20] jam_a_man: also single fire is fucked for most guns

[3:08:48] KontrolStyle: @Kaspian98, dps, but low dps
[3:08:51] aino33: did u kill xt 002 hm?
[3:08:53] Roreo_: Did they really call it "hard mode" back in the day? wheres the creativity LUL
[3:09:07] Hamsterjan: Mimiron HM requires coordination not as much DPS, but it's pretty fun

[3:09:16] Kaspian98: @kontrolstyle ah so he still getting it. OK thx

[3:11:18] iftix: wow classic?
[3:11:21] torgeth: I lvled up a ret pally years ago, but only raided on my lock. Ret was hella fun though!
[3:11:27] Szignec: Shroud's like one of my best friends
[3:11:29] scourgem1: Why do ppl play it then as ret
[3:11:31] Fennyyy: is ret good dps this tier
[3:11:33] ultraangry: they were called hardmodes yes
[3:11:34] PhysicsPlease: they did call it hard mode.

[3:11:35] zigsore: ´they did
[3:11:35] hikazey: sumWut The symbols, what do they mean
[3:11:36] dark_0s: for sure
[3:11:37] KontrolStyle: @deletem1, it's fun
[3:11:37] burningrob: yes we referred to this as hard mode
[3:11:40] iwantbetterlife: who is your raid leader @shroud
[3:11:42] Fierceee: It was 100% hard mode
[3:11:45] iisimiz: ModLove
[3:11:52] KEITHKILL11B: YES.. we did call it hard mode
[3:11:54] dark_0s: i mean we did it and we called it hardmode
[3:11:58] Rampageretadin: Ret is not good this tier. It's bottom tier. We don't get undead dmg buff + lose an ability in Holy Wrath.
[3:11:59] hikazey: Hardmode YEP
[3:12:00] iwantbetterlife: is the raidleader swedish?
[3:12:06] Kaspian98: @kontrolstyle is shroud close to top7 dmgers?
[3:12:08] hikazey: Sounds like it
[3:12:13] KontrolStyle: @Rampageretadin, they nerfed them this patch?
[3:12:13] PhysicsPlease: yes
[3:12:14] LeadEnder: 100%
[3:12:14] deekseverywhere: yes

[3:12:16] meikea_: yes they did lol
[3:12:17] Becuzihaveto: yes it was called hardmode
[3:12:18] Aculus: ya
[3:12:18] dark_0s: yes
[3:12:18] Becuzihaveto: lmao
[3:12:18] Leex2: we called it hard mode back in the day
[3:12:19] KontrolStyle: @Kaspian98, *shrug*
[3:12:22] burningrob: my guild 100% called it hardmode
[3:12:22] pugNana: it wasnt called achievement mode
[3:12:28] Fierceee: Was there. Can confirm. Hard mode
[3:12:29] TheCannnoN: it's not just an achievement, it's hm because it gies hm loot
[3:12:30] Exilez: Yes it was called hard mode because you had to trigger the "mode" with certain things
[3:12:33] Rampageretadin: However, it's useful for utility - more impact for utility this raid than Naxx
[3:12:33] iwantbetterlife: it was HM
[3:12:40] Beerski: it was pre heroic so you had to do something in the fight to make it "hard mode"
[3:12:42] b0gger_: hey @shroud random question bit of nostalgia but do you miss playing pubg with the likes of Wadu Hek and Bannaman ? all the old videos of you and them are absolutely hilarious watching back on them
[3:12:44] PhysicsPlease: it was the og hard mode called hard mode
[3:12:46] BakinPacman: achievement and the gear dropped higher ilvl
[3:12:47] Kesint: Tried constantly to get my guild do attempt hard modes back in the day
[3:12:53] Aragaith: i did algalon 10 man back in the day, a nightmare
[3:12:54] Sithres: How are people still talking about strats on a boss that has been killed like 100 million times by now
[3:12:54] KEITHKILL11B: it isn't JUST an achievement..it was the first raid they introduced better loot for the harder version of the fight. it was called hard mode and every player called it that
[3:12:54] iwantbetterlife: who is your raidleader?  @shroud
[3:12:55] Fight4Honor117: pretty sure its always been called hard mode
[3:12:59] Aragaith: but so much fun
[3:13:01] KontrolStyle: @b0gger_, wadu comes around sometimes
[3:13:10] EroX455: @Fight4Honor117 heroic
[3:13:15] KontrolStyle: @KEITHKILL11B, better loot
[3:13:27] hikazey: HUH
[3:13:34] b0gger_: @kontrolstyle I know he's a cool chill dude but I miss Bannaman
[3:13:35] iwantbetterlife: BANGER
[3:13:36] Fight4Honor117: @EroX455 never heard anyone call it that
[3:13:37] guatalian__: @shroud go youtube whatever boss hardmode you will see 13 year old videos calling it hardmode
[3:13:41] iwantbetterlife: GIVE US A BANGEER
[3:13:45] kelo__95: every comp is different also
[3:13:47] hikazey: music? Pog
[3:13:50] duuhveed: Its also hard..
[3:13:51] Fennyyy: imagine not doing this in 2008 KEKW
[3:13:53] FRANTICjk: "but it is old content" Pepega
[3:13:54] PhysicsPlease: The reason it started being called hardmode was largely based on the fact that you push a red button on mimiron, and it was fkn hard lol
[3:13:55] burningrob: this also isnt exactly the same as back in the day, different client, different coding
[3:13:56] Ali1331: I hated interrupting this boss so much
[3:14:07] guilexs: @shroud why not play dragonflight? new content dog
[3:14:15] Fight4Honor117: maybe alliance players called it heroic?
[3:14:21] Sithres: Damn well... true i guess
[3:14:23] hikazey: @guilexs savoring it
[3:14:23] KontrolStyle: @b0gger_, may have saw banna few years ago (i'm pretty new shroud watcher though)
[3:14:45] iisimiz: Squid1
[3:14:50] deekseverywhere: @guilexs he does play it, 413 enhance shaman
[3:14:57] burningrob: ranged gets an insane buff here
[3:15:00] hikazey: That's that sponsored content
[3:15:38] kleptos18: movement
[3:15:40] kleptos18: is horrible for locks
[3:15:45] hikazey: Takes a bit
[3:15:48] fndope1: shroud
[3:15:51] Tee__Gee_: probably losing snapshots
[3:15:58] zayneb666: that and if they go hard with dots in the puddle agro is an issue
[3:15:59] iwantbetterlife: mages are broken
[3:16:02] iwantbetterlife: Arcane mane
[3:16:05] iwantbetterlife: mage
[3:16:08] nitroe: Do you like Classic raiding more than retail?
[3:16:11] pugNana: are they doing 2 range groups?
[3:16:23] ra_kaethe: i dit 10k on this fight in 10man.. guess its alright
[3:16:26] Sweggee: nah, the locks are just bad tbh
[3:16:29] LordPoseidon1204: What am i watching rn? pepeMeltdown
[3:16:30] swaminatorr: @shroud do u like wotlk or retail better
[3:16:31] Sweggee: mages and locks are amazing here
[3:16:33] rippy15: arcane is really good here
[3:16:37] xxHELLOKITTY420x: arcane is nuts on this 12-15k easy
[3:16:37] hikazey: Always play arcane EZ
[3:16:38] iwantbetterlife: arcane is strong
[3:16:39] HighbrowTheInsane: warlock shouldnt rly dps till phase 2. Mana tap doesnt work
[3:16:40] jojoneutron: You can play arcane just do mana converve rotation
[3:16:44] briskrain710: your corruption will only last like 5-6 seconds with all the haste
[3:16:55] xxHELLOKITTY420x: the black pools reduce mana cost so can go more ham
[3:16:55] hikazey: Just have to COGGERS

[3:17:27] HHTiemo: It’s not like tbc anymore
[3:17:27] Zijkrial: IIRC kick has a 1% miss chance at max hit, but maybe I'm thinking of a previous expansion.
[3:17:28] LND_Otaku: kicks never miss
[3:17:46] snochalar: dk kick is a spell so can miss coz they arent spell hit capped

[3:20:18] zayneb666: hunters carrying the ranged

[3:20:32] Classicolas: copium
[3:20:35] iwantbetterlife: can someone tell me who is the raidleader?

[3:21:19] iwantbetterlife: is he swedish???
[3:21:20] Realskeel: WoD > vanilla and tbc
[3:21:21] dragoniitezz: @HHTiemo So HM is essentially not killing the Saronite and the extra Boss? If they kill 1 saronite will the boss not spawn or how do they engage in HM?
[3:21:23] Kiljir: Ulduar is the one good thinhg about WotLK
[3:21:26] Ikemp2: How did Shroud do 427k healing rooWut

[3:22:39] knostagosta: @shroud What watch do you wear?
[3:22:40] HHTiemo: @demonify no you kill them and they spawn pools where you can get mana back from, and animus only spawns if you keep all 8 saronites Alive
