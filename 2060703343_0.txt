[1:26:37] fabfizz: @olbrok we aren't all hydra
[1:26:52] prodigy_wow: they need to make STV no groups and kill streaks give bonus blood
[1:26:55] UnsafeCell: welcome to the jungle ;)
[1:26:59] Skry667: this was before the death debuff
[1:27:04] daggerslife: i think stv rewards for everything, but melee's are laughable :S
[1:27:12] RustyCusty: res at the ghost , that way you max hp and mana and run to new spot together
[1:27:25] Skry667: the ring is pretty good on priest
[1:27:31] ostkatt: What is the most op spec/class in pvp right now?
[1:27:39] olbrok: at current state priest/boomy/rogues are just miles ahead of others, or maybe it's because I play warrior, i'm a victim :/
[1:27:45] daggerslife: i as druid have super scuffed off hand and a good cloak
[1:27:46] fabfizz: @daggerslife that's what happens when you have the highest dps and non-range
[1:27:48] thommy_brasco: yo do you want an WA that shows you which target has the debuff and which target you can kill?

[1:31:19] Da_Funkz: It's good for PvE but I don't like how they've removed running out of mana for PvP

[1:36:35] fabfizz: @fakemejo nah
[1:36:35] JNOFI: I swear Blizzard has some internal document that was written in 2004 that says 20yard nameplates is essential for balance and must not be changed.
[1:36:48] fitzgeraldn: did you level US cause of tournys?
[1:36:56] gorglinz: @bezerka1 cnet.com is where I got mine!

[1:37:40] fitzgeraldn: @Annoulol whats the dispersion macro?
[1:37:43] Annoulol: it cant be from day to day
[1:37:55] Mystiggo: I just have a basic ass /cancelaura Dispersion on some of my spells and so far works 100% of the time
[1:37:57] Extramediums: @JNOFI I mean, Vanilla name plates were limited like that. I don't really hate it per se, but it is kinda true to vanilla in that way. Would I like 30+ yard? Sure, is it game breaking? Not really
[1:38:00] Mystiggo: idk what's up
[1:38:02] Annoulol: we cant make a cancelaura macro with dispersion
[1:38:36] cyanne112: they should make them 40y and make them not show through terrain
[1:38:39] cyanne112: and be done with it
[1:38:41] Annoulol: worked without any problems yesterday, but today it aint working
[1:39:04] bezerka1: Ive got the DPS and Healing ring from this event now, whats worth spending the coins on next? trinket seems ASS
[1:39:07] fitzgeraldn: @Annoulol just tried /cancelaura Dispersion macro and it worked
[1:39:39] Annoulol: @fitzgeraldn Yes, i did that yesterday. Worked great, but logged in now and its not
[1:39:54] fitzgeraldn: @Annoulol werid lol
[1:40:17] HeyImArty: respect the Owls
[1:40:24] Oxenia0: more like unlabalance druids amiright? haha
[1:40:31] Mistolin_: yeah
[1:40:33] Extramediums: I heard some one on stream the other day complaining that others should shut up about balance druids and let them have their 'op time'
[1:40:38] Syraky: druids are always OP blizzards baby
[1:40:39] Syraky: I hate it
[1:40:43] JNOFI: @Extramediums Sure, but a lot of stuff was changed in 2019 classic. Much higher view range, completely different addon API, different tab target behavior.
[1:40:52] eggsmasher: @Syraky druid is not always op xD
[1:40:56] HeyImArty: the amount of broken classes in SoD atm isnt even funny tho
[1:41:06] Extramediums: @Extramediums I'm aware.
[1:41:07] hunkuspocus: @Syraky i think you meant mage and rogue
[1:41:31] Syraky: godcomp for years, mythic + for years. SLSL lock duo entire TBC
[1:41:42] Syraky: yea god forbid something can challenge them right
[1:41:53] msnedker: And 10000 bomies 🤣
[1:42:03] Syraky: much rather play 100 games against mage rogue then a single fking druid
[1:42:08] nwjames1310: Why aren't you disc? Can you still not pump and be disc
[1:42:10] hunkuspocus: lmao. its insane that somebody complains about druid while mage and rogue exist.
[1:42:25] eggsmasher: what made druid op in TBC tho ?
[1:42:27] KussTV: I'll heal you on the next one, hmu
[1:42:41] Extramediums: I don't think SOD needs abilities that are 6 sec cds, use essentially no mana, and consistently crit for 1k+ and are instant
[1:42:48] daggerslife: whats the spawn time of this Techbot wtf
[1:42:50] msnedker: Yea wild growth is Nice tho 500 + healing on all party awhile pumpning 🤣😎
[1:42:55] Syraky: yea fck people having different tastes and annoyances right hunkus? @hunkuspocus
[1:42:58] optik_rec0rds: sod also does not need shadowstep and yet we are here..
[1:43:11] eggsmasher: @Extramediums might need a dmg nerf but else its fine
[1:43:14] JNOFI: As a druid, Starsurge is boring for us too, but the rest of our kit is so shit, we only got Starsurge

[2:08:49] Kyfoon: warr is better
[2:09:03] Kyfoon: for cleave
[2:09:04] Mafajazz: feels like 4 mages and a lock that just pulls with eye of killrog would be quite dirty, could be wrong tho
[2:09:15] majingold: any spec for healing?
[2:10:38] fakemejo: @Mafajazz eye dies on 1 hit without shield
[2:10:40] KussTV: are you only using LFG addon?  I wonder if the pumpers don't bother and just find groups in LFG channel
[2:10:54] letsgetgoingyo: how much damage does 1 application of void plague do?
[2:10:56] frozenpizza2209: is STV pvp fun?
[2:11:20] Mafajazz: @fakemejo ah ofc, so true lol
[2:12:36] Mystiggo: melee cleave is probably more chill healing wise than wiz cleave
[2:12:36] cgc11: Its constant healing, everyone taking damage
[2:12:45] Mystiggo: cus you chain pull but smaller pulls
[2:12:59] Sinostra: might be worth a shot

[2:17:19] Mafajazz: no boon leveling on priest is sad times
[2:18:09] Byshash: is that a privacy addon to hide nicknames? that's clever
[2:18:15] HeyImArty: survival requires atleast 15 IQ, BM requires 5
[2:18:20] HeyImArty: so they default to BM
[2:18:32] TrebekTv: prob dont have the proper runes either
[2:18:39] letsgetgoingyo: what would survival do? For dungeons you go MM to maximize aoe damage
[2:18:47] peeweeherman69: melee hunt going surv for the 20% crit and hit %
[2:19:10] Sinostra: GY doesn't give the best xp, once you're gonna be 32, it'll be better with Lib
[2:19:17] letsgetgoingyo: melee sucks without runes, that requires you to hunt around the world lvl 40 elite
[2:19:17] TrebekTv: warriors
[2:19:32] letsgetgoingyo: melee isnt viable until you get the max level runes thats why
[2:19:52] frozenpizza2209: 2h enhance bis or dual?

[2:25:32] Sinostra: maybe there's one here in chat ?
[2:25:53] carlosctc: is there any decent gear in any sm inst ?
[2:26:06] Kyfoon: ye they buffed it
[2:26:09] veil_dust: maybe they watch ur stream on 2nd monitor so that's why do low dps Kappa
[2:26:13] daggerslife: if ur melee yes
[2:26:20] daggerslife: if ur caster and fully bis from 25
[2:26:23] daggerslife: nope
[2:26:35] carlosctc: am a caster so am chillin
[2:27:56] pAnicc: I always leave it

[2:33:01] Danzolicious: no stream snipe
[2:33:20] Skry667: its a nameplate mod, think for visability
[2:33:31] Sinostra: Student's folder is a nice thing to have
[2:34:30] Rebukenx: 40k xp/h is horrible
[2:35:02] pAnicc: Im in the swamps killing there for 40k
[2:35:21] ConnectKivik: they are fucking trash then
[2:35:33] Mystiggo: it's tilt city out here. you find a nice 50-60k an hour group and 3 runs in someone "has to go"
[2:35:42] MxKV__: pugs are so insanely below average.  it's painful.
[2:35:43] Mystiggo: just standing around looking for groups wasting time
[2:35:46] poodiiyo: the average player skill in sod is that of a poorly set up bot in 209
[2:35:47] poodiiyo: 2009

[3:28:47] letsgetgoingyo: its 1100 damage guaranteed for 1 GCD, doesnt even have to crit like starsurge. crazy actually
[3:28:51] notJumu: classicaura had an update
[3:29:21] breadwilton: @letsgetgoingyo what is?
[3:29:26] bassiemon123: Does dispersion remove all slows aswel?
[3:29:33] letsgetgoingyo: void plague. 188 damage per tick, 6 ticks.
[3:29:38] krit23k: krit23k watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! HAI! TwitchVotes FBPass FBPenalty Kappu HSWP
[3:29:52] krit23k: hydraFOE
[3:30:03] Feadshy: Hey Hydra, what specc did or would u level with starting at 25 with bfd gear?
[3:30:13] breadwilton: id trade it for starsurge any day XD
[3:30:27] FrizzBizz: @Hydramist You can't make opposite factions on same account on pvp server.
[3:30:48] xsurgonx: @Stompsville another silly question. should i go shadow from 30 on? or need mind spike first?
[3:30:49] bassiemon123: Bloodmoon event everywhere hydraTilt
[3:31:25] letsgetgoingyo: its combined with SWP and you do like 1800 damage in 2gcds. Everything that comes into your LoS will die for 2 globals spent. Just have to live while they perish
[3:31:32] bassiemon123: This is for the raid/profession item?
[3:31:45] breadwilton: @letsgetgoingyo that last part is hard in this patch XD
[3:31:50] breadwilton: or if they have a healer
[3:31:55] thenewguy176: is blizz going to reduce boss armor values?
[3:32:10] letsgetgoingyo: granted yea, but you also got disperse too. My point is just the damage is really broken on VP specifically.
[3:32:19] HeyImArty: t
[3:32:33] breadwilton: ya for 1v1s its nuts but in stv its useless
[3:32:36] breadwilton: only burst matters
[3:32:42] letsgetgoingyo: will scale even further with more SP gear from raid
[3:32:56] breadwilton: it will get nerfed lots of ppl crying about spriest and boomkin
[3:32:56] bassiemon123: Stv isnt that mutch fun tho, in my opinion
[3:33:02] breadwilton: im surprised nobody crying about melee hunters 1 shotting
[3:33:17] breadwilton: @bassiemon123 ya but its the only pvp content that matters atm XD
[3:33:29] bassiemon123: Yee true
[3:33:39] letsgetgoingyo: probably will get more complaints about that later, but melee is easier to deal with generally rather than 40 yard abilities killing you with no counterplay
[3:33:42] breadwilton: i guess ppl dont care if melee 1 shots since its melee
[3:34:03] breadwilton: they just need to remove all 1 shots from the game
[3:34:09] breadwilton: need to slow down the TTK like crazy
[3:34:13] breadwilton: but all the trash players will complain
[3:34:28] bayernmunchen90: how to get tailo head?
[3:34:29] breadwilton: high ttk - favors skill and makes it harder for average players to keep up :(
[3:34:39] letsgetgoingyo: some more stamina on gear would help, and also reduce damage of starsurge/voidplague by like 30% too
[3:34:40] breadwilton: @bayernmunchen90 wowhead/yt vid has all u need im sure
[3:34:43] Shrek_xxd: what is this song ?
[3:34:59] breadwilton: I have 1.5k hp :( just about everyone one shots me
[3:35:30] breadwilton: hydra geared af so expectations should be wavered a bit lmao
[3:36:14] thereal_flair: best class in SoD at 40 so far?
[3:36:21] letsgetgoingyo: druid and priest

[3:40:20] breadwilton: P1 spriest was abysmal
[3:40:30] bassiemon123: Thats some dmg Kreygasm
[3:40:34] snayrofficial: how many wildvine you get last night

[4:04:06] drpuppenbock: u dont play disc more ?
[4:04:08] drpuppenbock: in p2
[4:04:09] BebopHero: i believe thats still pretty good damage for a 1.5 cast, compared to scorch and searing pain for lock
[4:04:28] Dreameaterz: bruh spike shouldnt be compared to scorch or searing
[4:04:31] Dreameaterz: KEKW
[4:04:39] BebopHero: why not?
[4:05:02] algroe: what u think about feral in pvp?
[4:05:13] Dreameaterz: look at the use of searing or scorch in a dps rotation
[4:05:19] Dreameaterz: now look at spike
[4:05:38] BebopHero: spike is literally better, it buffs your mind blast
[4:05:49] BebopHero: while having a better coefficient and scaling from talents

[4:10:27] HeyImArty: thats just unhealthy
[4:10:49] thunderpunx: STV event as shadow priest sounds fun

[4:41:56] Kreynz: it's stupid how u can still get blood with the 60 second debuff

[7:28:09] sudd7: not sure if I like this or not, it doesn’t feel very skillful. not implying your anyone else has no skill, it just doesn’t seem to require any. that’s just my opinion
[7:28:13] mussletets420: can you use the epic boots use-effect together with dispersion and they stack?
[7:28:22] cig_ldn: Sorry to ask, why is everyone flagged for pvp?
[7:28:31] Millzeh: Whats disc like for the wpvp stuff @Hydramist ?
[7:28:42] niko5341: @sudd7 u dont need skills for classic
[7:28:53] hamzaderkiller: wtf you cant see now if ppl are worth coins  ?
[7:28:58] hamzaderkiller: thats unreal retarded
[7:29:16] sudd7: @niko5341 in a 1v1 you need skill against evenly geared lvl’d players
[7:29:32] sudd7: in a 1v2 or even 1v3
[7:29:36] kinglourenco: swim underwater and hide
[7:29:47] sudd7: but 1v anything in this you just get steamrolled
[7:30:00] sudd7: still seems fun.
[7:30:22] kinglourenco: i heard you can fish for rare items during stv event
[7:31:31] Blaastrix: hello

[7:34:33] Gremara: how is warlock performing in pvp
[7:35:10] NeVolent: poorly

[7:35:31] Vir0n: Vir0n watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! insane dedication
[7:36:13] BebopHero: so crazy how many ppl fotm rerolled to boomkin LOL
[7:36:21] BebopHero: remember era where seeing a moonkin was a rare treat
[7:36:25] NeVolent: warlock suposed to be the DOT class and its the worse dot class in the game xD even mages living bomb does more dmg than all of his dots
[7:36:50] enigmasvea: boomie ms still meh in pve tho so rip those who rerolled boomie
[7:36:51] NeVolent: are they? :P
[7:36:55] NeVolent: i think rogues do that
[7:36:59] Sinostra: Broooooooooo, what am i coming to
[7:37:00] twitchara7: that is so right lol warlock always beent op
[7:37:10] artform_: lmao leave us warlocks alone ryan Sadg
[7:37:12] artform_: Sadge
[7:37:14] twitchara7: preist hard countering warlock in sod
[7:37:17] Sinostra: why so mad about locks ?
[7:37:23] BebopHero: i dont think that should justify a entire class being dogshit
[7:37:30] BebopHero: i think there should be a strive for balance
[7:37:40] replayxtv: druid is thw rost sod could have happen imo. starsurge is on another level w 15% chance on stun for an insta cast
[7:37:45] twitchara7: tounrey im calling it priest takes tthe win
[7:37:54] artform_: spoken like a true priest main KEKW
[7:37:55] Sinostra: do you prefer enhance ?
[7:37:57] Kyfoon: you clearly hated tbc 2s lock/druid comps KEKW
[7:38:01] Sinostra: or ret ?
[7:38:13] BebopHero: im calling it now, OTK is gonna call off the sod tournament after witnessing phase 2 pvp balance
[7:38:18] sudd7: there not gonna do weekly balancing for lvl 40 pvp tbf
[7:38:20] BebopHero: or change it for lvl 60
[7:38:22] sudd7: they’re
[7:39:15] nwafighta: @hydramist 6th !!!!
[7:39:18] nwafighta: nwafighta subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[7:39:20] NeVolent: wish the dmg toned down a bit :P i prefer to see or do some kiting outplays etc , now you have no chance :P u either one shot or get one shot :P
[7:39:38] NeVolent: Hydra i think u are kinda biased against locks :P
[7:39:42] Sinostra: when you're talking about 1v1s, yeah
[7:39:50] BebopHero: haunt needs a cast, drain life rune should be only 25% extra healing
[7:39:53] Sinostra: in 3s, you can also beat a lock comp
[7:40:07] BebopHero: all the gimmicky instant cast runes casters have gotten all need cast time, living bomb needs a cast time living flame needs a cast time
[7:40:12] Istunlocklocalpensioners: !server
[7:40:12] Nightbot: Living Flame Horde EU / Crusader Strike Horde US
[7:40:38] NeVolent: then Void plague needs cast time also? no i dont like cast times... then melees are king
[7:41:07] BebopHero: is void plague is still doing the same damage then yes it should have a cast time
[7:41:20] Istunlocklocalpensioners: is crusader strike locked atm?
[7:41:27] NeVolent: i dont agree..especialy for haunt cause it does 0 dmg
[7:41:46] brexy808: you are farming right next to the GY lol
[7:41:49] sudd7: slam needs a cast time Kappa
[7:41:53] BebopHero: yeah but it requires zero skill to setup and it gives a huge self heal while buffing all your other dots. its too much value
[7:41:56] verylovelyx: damn death is op
[7:41:57] BebopHero: aka a gimmick
[7:42:22] NeVolent: then the same goes for melees...whats the skill to just pump all ur skills?
[7:42:26] Sinostra: @BebopHero kinda like every class in sod, yeah
[7:42:35] NorwayLars91: Do you have a video out on your pvp spec? I know ur pve now, but I wanna se how you set up ur pvp :)
[7:42:38] BebopHero: thats the issue with sod runes its a literal gimmick arms race
[7:42:42] algroe: do u think arcane heal will work in pvp?
[7:42:43] NeVolent: the gameplay of sod is amazing...its just some skills are overtuned...
[7:42:49] BebopHero: for melee? use your pets to cc/ nades ect like you used to in era
[7:43:03] BebopHero: use a gnomish net launcher
[7:43:04] BebopHero: theres so many things
[7:43:06] Sinostra: @BebopHero that's the entire point of sod
[7:43:07] NeVolent: they just shoudl nerf dmg or pump the HP
[7:43:41] cptjohntravolta: oh is this the Netsky remix?

[7:43:49] schvckv: feels like you dont need minf flay anymore in pvp :D
[7:43:57] schvckv: mind flay*
[7:44:04] BebopHero: @Sinostra they originally stated it was to make the meme underperforming specs be brought up to warrior level and add interesting new ways to play a class. instead runes are just 1000% better abilities than your base abilities

[7:45:14] Toxiferous: why res at the gy and not another spirit?
[7:46:03] Sinostra: @BebopHero yeah, but it also did make some specs viable, how were sp, boomy, back in era ?
[7:46:05] replayxtv: Bro devs nowadays don't even play their game
[7:46:19] Sinostra: sure, it's overtuned
[7:46:27] Sinostra: but it did kinda deliver
[7:46:42] uaintgotno1: is mind flay never used?
[7:46:57] BebopHero: @Sinostra making them viable by buffing the foundation of the class is a much better solution than adding "x ability does 10x more damage than all of your normal spells at almost no cost and instant"
[7:47:00] spojav: @Sinostra sp was decent, boomy was just kiting forever with moonfire xD
[7:47:02] jonisyntinen: Kekw 1,2k instant
[7:47:09] pew2700: Did they make mind spike the same animation as haunt...lol
[7:47:10] NeVolent: why use it? :P mind spike does more dmg and its 42 yards range...plus lower mana
[7:47:24] NeVolent: no its like frsotbolt
[7:47:31] MeerTwT: imagine mind sear there
[7:47:33] MeerTwT: haha
[7:47:37] BebopHero: @Sinostra take for example void plague vs devouring plague, dp costs 4x more mana while doing 4x less damage
[7:48:02] kunkkadosed: @BebopHero thats good, i dont want meta to be must be undead or gtfo
[7:48:05] Sinostra: @BebopHero Then you'd have to buff all the talents
[7:48:21] BebopHero: @Sinostra sure, thats 100% fine, make a rune that buffs talents those exist already

[7:51:13] NeVolent: i dont like the fact that 30% stamina only works for the event
[7:51:21] CARL_9000: dont even need death, 1 fear and the dots will kill me alone xD
[7:51:23] Ak3rf3ldt: How many coins you need ?

[7:52:56] jess1ng: !spec
[7:52:56] Nightbot: no jerome
[7:53:19] Mafajazz: hmmm maybe a weird take, keep the dmg. make backlash 100% again... so we have to be careful until they have 60% hp then press it haha
[7:53:23] MeerTwT: get 10mithril bar
[7:53:26] MeerTwT: first
[7:53:38] NeVolent: they shouldnt gave us 30% stamina...should gave us items on blood moon Vendor with MORE STAMINA!!!!!
[7:53:48] NeVolent: pvp sets or smth
[7:53:50] MeerTwT: oh wait sry
[7:53:53] Sinostra: @Mafajazz make backlash 300% ^^
[7:54:19] BebopHero: that would be fun lmao
[7:54:20] aesash: i wonder if lifebloom is busted, noone took it cuz they take starsurge
[7:54:43] prodigy_wow: inv!
[7:55:09] Sinostra: just farm them on eu next week
[7:55:09] blahpjiyah: the bloodmoon changes are nice
[7:55:13] oddfud: cross server grp possible now?
[7:55:13] apostolis131313: talents please
[7:55:14] tharinde: 1k rep per weekly quest from ashenvale you'll get it by end of phase
[7:55:17] Sinostra: you're almost exalted on eu
[7:55:24] Mafajazz: @aesash lifebloom is absolut dog crap
[7:55:31] Sinostra: @tharinde that's over
[7:55:38] Sinostra: at 40, it doesn't give rep
[7:56:32] Weddzz: New blue post :D

[7:57:12] Ballprint: i went 2 ferals 3 rogues in STV
[7:57:13] Sinostra: why don't pets respawn with players like in  wsg ?
[7:57:14] Ballprint: farmed 550 coins
[7:57:17] Ballprint: 3 events in a row
[7:57:19] Sinostra: that's fking annoying
[7:57:24] Weddzz: I mean compare it to Ashenvale PVP event - this is a hella win tbh
[7:57:24] Abovedeathxgodx: @hydramist do you need something more for the helm from tailoring?
[7:57:27] JustOndore: Its super fun. Just too laggy
[7:57:44] NeVolent: yea
[7:57:46] rusemucho: hydra, whats talents u use for shadow pvp?
[7:57:46] NeVolent: lagg is problem
[7:57:48] Istunlocklocalpensioners: I want a blood moon to come out IRL nadedSpin
[7:57:56] Ballprint: lagg on EU daytime event is horrendous, cant do shit
[7:58:16] Sinostra: @Istunlocklocalpensioners there are countries that fit that need
[7:58:20] BebopHero: i think locks have the worst stv experience atm, not even cause of balance but because when u die it respawns you without your pet so you just run out of shards insta
[7:58:21] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @Sinostra lol
[7:58:24] Zelimeth: im i late to the party about the starsurge nerf @Hydramist

[7:58:53] bubbagumpptv: Can you show your runes?

[7:58:55] BebopHero: WORLD WARCRAFT Z
[7:59:01] Mafajazz: Damn i can get behind that!
[7:59:01] blahpjiyah: itll just be filled with rogues sniping kills
[7:59:04] Pulleft: that would just be hardcore colluded
[7:59:06] BebopHero: becomes a survival game
[7:59:12] marsj0: Group of 5 rogues. Would not work
[7:59:13] Mafajazz: but no grping or only 3 per grp then?
[7:59:14] Weddzz: ppl would just camp altars?
[7:59:16] BebopHero: genius @Hydramist +1 to that idea
[7:59:16] Weddzz: 5 man rogue parties
[7:59:17] uaintgotno1: shit idea with rogue groups around
[7:59:20] Kyfoon: escape from tarkov? Pog
[7:59:28] Istunlocklocalpensioners: group of 5 rogues would actually ruin everyone lol
[7:59:32] Istunlocklocalpensioners: if co-ordinated
[7:59:46] Istunlocklocalpensioners: spec ops team
[7:59:47] Sinostra: still want a battle royale i see
[7:59:54] BebopHero: why did you have to come up with that idea. now im gonna be perma upset that they never did it that way
[8:00:00] Pulleft: blood moon royale
[8:00:28] Mafajazz: @Pulleft lol actually sounds like a game
[8:01:06] Mafajazz: just bring the bus and let us glide down ^^
[8:01:37] dogsenses: whats that small green number on your spells?
[8:02:12] BebopHero: it would also draw out the event much longer to extend the gameplay loop instead of people doing the event a few times and receiving all their bis items
[8:02:13] Nyoxx: 2 days back to back can you believe it it's like a guinness advert
[8:03:14] ItsaMeGeneParmesan: in bg's as a disc, what are your thoughts on empowered renew vs renewed hope?
[8:03:29] elarielxdfg: If I am rank 3 currently and I have 10k honor, would it matter at all for my rank 4 if I end the week with this or I will just need to make the quota next week?
[8:03:32] BebopHero: you should make a reddit post of that idea, it would do well. then maybe blizz can implement a blood moon part 2 for phase 3
[8:03:35] khourdrick: can you get AB rep from blood event?
[8:03:57] ItsaMeGeneParmesan: oh true! that actually sounds amazing. thanks
[8:04:12] Sinostra: @BebopHero blizz wouldn't do it, death is too punishing for that
[8:04:19] Dreameaterz: helm done mate?
[8:04:22] SchmeckoButterboy: the ab rep just got demolished by the early brids so they had to adjust
[8:04:45] BebopHero: @Sinostra that's the point. it gives a taste of hardcore without all the hyper negatives of losing your character. you just gotta wait till next bloodmoon to try again
[8:04:51] lucasthebestx: are u raiding with pugs?

[8:10:59] NeVolent: damn how myuch gold u have to spend?
[8:11:02] Mafajazz: gonna be like 30% nerf death and like 20% void spike buff or something pve related, just like boomy nerf now, compensation 100% pve related

[8:16:24] Nyoxx: was that 6 paladins??
[8:16:28] Mafajazz: its like the baseline always stays same, with coefficient gearing is not gonna feel as good
[8:16:57] vrsswow: boomies getting nerfd or they already nerfed
[8:17:09] BebopHero: i cant believe they called the 100% coefficient a "bug". if it took them that long to hotfix a widely-known "bug" i'm a bit worried
[8:17:13] Mafajazz: but it surely needed a nerf, death need one also if im honest. sadly lol

[8:29:35] AshSzpigel: shadow is jokes this phase its embarrassing
[8:30:01] BebopHero: @AshSzpigel alot of specs are jokes rn, rogue mutilate does more damage than a 5 point eviscerate
[8:30:06] prostyle27: what talents am I running for leveling to 40 ?! as shadow
[8:30:11] Draytx: shadow is the new moondkin, but a bit better xD
[8:30:37] AshSzpigel: @BebopHero nowhere near as much as dps/survivabilit as spriest and moonkin
[8:31:00] Dreameaterz: stv event broken mat
[8:31:11] Dreameaterz: they changed the debuff to a buff> so cant see who has it
[8:31:23] BebopHero: @AshSzpigel regardless, a 40 energy ability should not be doing more damage than a 5 point finisher. my point is that alot of specs rn are jokes including the ones you said
[8:32:33] tokyolab40: i'm a main moonkin but i'm glad about the 30% nerf dmg
[8:32:34] LuxzGaming: Is gold farming doable on a shadow priest?
[8:33:06] thesunnyside: @LuxzGaming Made 200g yesterday. Not shadow specific but worked well

[8:37:41] SpazzleDazzle: Starsurge is getting a nerf they posted
[8:37:42] nikaedge: pvp
[8:37:42] blahpjiyah: the amount of druids crying in the classic discord over the nerf is disgusting, black mold brain rot
[8:37:49] murxll99: randy trouble
[8:38:27] vrsswow: 1,3k swd ? wtf
[8:38:50] nikaedge: were druids nerfed? when?
[8:38:53] BebopHero: @blahpjiyah have you seen the census? balance druid is the highest by a ton, and thats because of fotm reroll
[8:38:53] Toxiferous: @blahpjiyah sounds entertaining
[8:39:04] aoe_enjoyer: KEKW
[8:39:05] Kyfoon: im playing a druid and i think its a good change, i think the coefficient nerf might be a bit overkill but *shrug*
[8:39:13] tokyolab40: @nikaedge 30mn ago
[8:39:16] tapestry11: @Hydramist is SS getting nerfed?
[8:39:19] BebopHero: @Kyfoon starfire will truck
[8:39:21] blahpjiyah: i play druid too and the nerf is good lol
[8:39:29] ReykooTv: starsurge gameplay is fun yo

[8:39:37] vrsswow: is it nerfed or gona be nerfed
[8:39:47] SpazzleDazzle: @tapestry11 fixed sp coefficient, and reduced base dmg by 30%, but it buffs next SF
[8:39:52] ReykooTv: i push button they die i happy
[8:40:18] theEntropie: don't nerf death, I need another 4 days of fun
[8:40:19] BebopHero: dont worry guys the 100% coefficient for 3 months was just a bug
[8:40:37] BebopHero: totally not a lack of balancing foresight nope

[8:45:14] LuxzGaming: Ive always jumped around on a lot of classes never really settled on a main class. Priest is prob the one ive played the least, maybe i should try it out
[8:45:19] Sinostra: i don't understand why you're pve spec in the first place
[8:45:20] NorwayLars91: And I also wanna se ur mindflay action

[8:46:43] Skiban123: Will you be going for the engi belt or what are your thoughts on it?
[8:46:53] Sasoriyo: Does shadow also feel good in pve? @Hydramist
[8:47:23] qmvplol: what about pve is SP good?
[8:47:34] nikaedge: @SpazzleDazzle so theoretically it would work if I'm at ~50%? I only play enh so trying to find ways to make it work
[8:47:45] Sasoriyo: Wait, it's that high?
[8:47:47] Sasoriyo: Who's #1?
[8:47:56] Toxiferous: melee hunter by a mile
[8:47:57] BebopHero: @Sasoriyo melee hunter and its not even close
[8:48:07] elarielxdfg: actually, it's 4th
[8:48:11] exzetron: rip Starsurge nerf
[8:48:19] elarielxdfg: Mage, Hunter, Lock and even high end boomie beat it
[8:48:32] grimd0g: Ele or Sp for pvp?
[8:48:34] BebopHero: @elarielxdfg mage is misleading the ignite damage is from 2 mages stacking
[8:48:38] rebelscumx: rip mind flay =[
[8:48:51] Sinostra: poor lock :(
[8:48:52] Sasoriyo: What happened to mind flay?
[8:48:56] SpazzleDazzle: @nikaedge if you time AG with a free heal and missing HP then ya, it'd work. But thats a good chunk to invest in one kill. If you even get the kill
[8:49:01] ligmasauce: how is affli on pve guys ?
[8:49:03] elarielxdfg: @BebopHero that doesn't make sense considering there is 1 mage in raid
[8:49:20] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[8:49:29] SpazzleDazzle: Youd probably be better off going 2h bonk spec and praying for procs

[8:49:42] qmvplol: PI buff?

[8:52:17] nikaedge: does the shadow word kill require some kind of setup?
[8:52:27] huzzleqt: @ReykooTv its huge dm nerf
[8:52:31] SpazzleDazzle: @nikaedge way of earth is pretty OP in pvp overall, so id almost always runs it personally

[9:20:58] Anhov: i farmed heart for about an hour today, got 10
[9:21:09] bomzzwtf: But there are 50 people farming heart of the wild
[9:21:11] niceguuyx: where do you farm heart, swamp?
[9:21:15] Revansoon: heart of the wild should cost a bit more
[9:21:27] Mafajazz: i miss arena so badly, but im done with retail now also
[9:21:32] Pettidutt: hey bud, cant find ur upgrade links in your latest vid, any chance u can ppullem out?
[9:21:33] Mystylerocks: what do ppl use it for and has become so pricey? some rune?
[9:21:39] bomzzwtf: tail;oring
[9:21:42] Lythi: nah thats fair! luckily i´ve got about 10 yeaars of pvp practice to catch up on, thats keeping me in the game atm! and AWC ofc
[9:21:45] bomzzwtf: Some other things iguess

[9:24:11] HelluvaWrecks: the amount of time ive been stunned by starsurge back to back
[9:24:22] bomzzwtf: Imagine if we had SWD on 6 sec cd
[9:25:18] murxll99: meanwhile proccing stuns left and right with any shadow - "starsurge should not procc stun" xD
[9:25:21] Lythi: sheesh, the dmg
[9:25:35] leetsu1: spriests are mega broken too tbh :D
[9:26:08] bomzzwtf: Dont  compare starsurge and death
[9:26:43] the_moist_factory: we need to do skull of ID soon bro
[9:26:44] ConnectKivik: Starsurge is way too op
[9:26:45] bomzzwtf: Starsurge has a 6 sec on a class that can kite you and is immune to slows that does no damage to you ever
[9:26:46] Mafajazz: shadow at 40 is always gonna be good, the prob is they ran out of mana lol, no more + some cheeky 1 shots.  Luv it ^^
[9:26:56] smartmovez: can you control the homonculus minions? they often don't target ranged mobs
[9:26:57] niceguuyx: starsurge has already been nerfed boys coming soon dw
[9:27:04] bomzzwtf: If u death and dont kill which is on 12 sec cd u just kill yourself
[9:27:10] xhosas: 1.3k crit, dont compare starsurge with swd Pepega
[9:27:12] ConnectKivik: Starsurge is a different beast compared to everything else that is broken
[9:27:17] Ak3rf3ldt: That pala inted
[9:27:22] luzid7: is critt also the best stat for shadow in pvp?
[9:27:24] bomzzwtf: @xhosas Starsurge crits the same
[9:27:41] xhosas: thats why both should get nerfed, but only one got
[9:27:48] pw_scyld: is it still worth running tap with how much more mana efficient spriest is now?
[9:27:51] Dreameaterz: such a banger this is too
[9:27:56] xhosas: im a priest myself btw, id swd should be nerfed
[9:28:03] falfr: Imagine if starsurge had a 12 second CD and damaged you if it didnt kill the enemy for half the damage
[9:28:14] bomzzwtf: So i suppose we nerf rogues too cuz they kill priests in a cheap shgot
[9:28:21] KcolraWertex: @falfr would still be broken
[9:28:34] richardgeniusturkey: @Hydramist Think they will add RBGS?
[9:28:37] Lythi: Hydra, would you mind me asking what you prefer about classic/SoD pvp compared to retail?
[9:29:00] joofannej: !tierlist
[9:29:09] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpPjLHVpiyU
[9:29:16] niceguuyx: ok
[9:29:37] niceguuyx: so i nuked my points
[9:29:42] griffithismydaddy: expect new 60 raids?
[9:29:53] lemarky_: 10$ a month from 1m~ ppl; cant afford 300k/y in salary Kappa
[9:30:23] leetsu1: pvp wise its good to nerf surge, but what about pve, its gonna be dogshit dps :D
[9:30:24] bomzzwtf: @lemarky_ probably even less salary cuz blizzard pay the worst
[9:30:30] Lythi: basically it feels a lot more like chess with the big buttons than an MMO where every button matters
[9:30:40] nosefinger: i enjoy the pace of the game in retail it just feels smooth pressing globals
[9:30:49] xhosas: had to fire 20% of devs coz to cover bobby exit fee KEKW
[9:30:54] richardgeniusturkey: @Hydramist Balance the game around PVP, i feel like it would be so easy to adjust things about RBGs. The game would be way more popular with an MMR based system in it for PVP like Arena etc.
[9:30:55] Lythi: yeah gotcha, that makes sense! thanks dude
[9:30:59] Mafajazz: could not said it better myself, thats why i quit
[9:31:10] Mafajazz: its like a spreadsheet
[9:31:10] falfr: its unironically why some people suck in classic wow because they dont think about how they are actually playing the game and using their abilities
[9:31:11] richardgeniusturkey: @Hydramist Surely thats a copout "cant afford to hire people for PVP balance"
[9:31:16] Toxiferous: improv
[9:31:16] Mafajazz: somone pops this, you pop taht
[9:31:21] lequani: outplay
[9:31:44] Mafajazz: its almost like a boss fight when you get to higher ratings

[9:33:06] Mafajazz: thats why i enjoyed doing a undergeared new char at retail before i quit, low rated and no gear, people had no clue so shit felt so unscripted
[9:33:10] Kalnyer: is shadow pvp s tier?^^
[9:33:21] lemarky_: Wrath pacing migth be too fast vs tbc tho
[9:33:32] phnx2k: retail is fun rn tbf
[9:33:41] the_moist_factory: do we ever craft dreamweave or not worth?
[9:33:49] bomzzwtf: On my server heart of the wild costs double of wildvine ryan
[9:33:51] aroneatingsoup: positioning as a healer is everything in retail with the amount of ccs and kicks
[9:33:56] wowjunkie94: Quick Question about the raid when u get time about grubbis
[9:34:02] Dreameaterz: Ima dip it lad, pcepce have a goodone
[9:34:08] gmar_07: whats the best pvp opener and rotation?
[9:34:24] Lythi: i think your description is pretty on point
[9:34:37] sleepytempest: this song SLAPS
[9:34:44] Mafajazz: its not that retail is not fun, its the cooldown trading and the passive gameplay that ruining it for me atleast. to start with lol
[9:35:06] unselfish123: can't wait more mop classic
[9:35:20] luzid7: im so glad they nerf boomkins

[9:35:46] bomzzwtf: What they hitting for now
[9:35:49] arieuh: Why boomy nerf priest way to strong lmao
[9:36:11] lemarky_: Retail is all about who got the best pve rotation LUL
[9:36:27] lemarky_: Kinda like how melee play in wrath tbh
[9:36:47] Mafajazz: @lemarky_ it do be like that really
[9:36:50] Lythi: yeah retail seems very "figured out" at the top level
[9:36:51] wouch88: EZ GG
[9:37:11] fafoo204: whats the rep lookin like so far
[9:37:18] lequani: is mind flay any better ?
[9:37:18] jarpzy: is there any point to have holy fire and smite on your bars anywhere as spriest?
[9:37:39] bomzzwtf: Have you done the pain supp rune? @Hydramist  how was it
[9:37:52] GharzokTV: private server classic was way better than the official relaunch tbh

[9:39:42] Mafajazz: yeah holy fire, better of save gold not train lol
[9:39:58] wouch88: how nice is it to have a mount now?
[9:41:00] luzid7: is that the rfd chest?
[9:41:57] fitzgeraldn: its unreal how stacked you are after 1 gnomer, nothing dropped for me :(
[9:42:43] Kiroxx: yeah 600/300 priest trinket would be palayble
[9:43:24] Loomilol: which class do you think is the worst in pvp right now ? like an absolute joke
[9:43:57] pw_scyld: the damage you take from the trinket is also affected by shadowform. you take 345 instead of 300. But you can use it on yourself, so i guess still good 1v1 against mage
[9:44:28] jbeckers2: can u share your play list ?

[10:30:50] Dakkroth: doesnt sound bad
[10:30:53] Mafajazz: but rested almost 600 xp mob so, ended up around 60% mana after 1 mob
[10:31:25] Mafajazz: but i have disperse and mind spike and 33 so that kinda makes it easier
[10:31:27] Dakkroth: ya even just killing mobs 1by1 with good pace is way better xp/h than world farming or bad dungeon grps
[10:31:43] Mafajazz: but tbf if i have WB and soem consumes i could do 3 mobs a tiem under 1 min
[10:31:52] Dakkroth: u should always go there with wb ofc ofc

[11:50:46] ReykooTv: @Sowiloo you must be talking about pve
[11:51:09] Sowiloo: @ReykooTv starfire hits like a truck now
[11:51:28] Mafajazz: soz but starfire does not do pvp
[11:51:50] nike_rise: warrior or rogue
[11:51:51] ReykooTv: @Sowiloo lol starfire? no eclipse crit (so 2% crit) and no knockback or kick protect. gl in pvp son
[11:52:57] Sowiloo: @ReykooTv well having an instant 600 crit starsurge is still "decent" not completely overpowered and overtuned as 1200
[11:53:11] 7dogtreats: are you gonna do a sp guide
[11:54:18] Mafajazz: @Sowiloo the thing is even if SS dmg is quite good, what more can they do`? spam moonfire (sunfire but then no WG)
[11:54:51] Lunaatj: Cheeky 1.3k
[11:54:59] ReykooTv: @Sowiloo unfortuantely blizzard based the entire spec around 1 op skill. they didnt spread the power across casted spells so its just a huge nerf
[11:55:16] Mafajazz: belive me SS needed nerf, its just they need something, im not even boomy player now
[11:56:00] Mafajazz: but 1 spell literally making boomy even viable is such a bad design, and now  gutt it for pvp
[11:56:16] ReykooTv: @Mafajazz basically this
[11:56:16] Sowiloo: it wasn't designed that way in any case, the damage per spell power was bugged
[11:56:34] ReykooTv: @Sowiloo thats even worse if that were the case
[11:57:25] Sowiloo: the modifier was like x1 when should be 0.4 on top of that they nerfed the base damage 30% so yeah rip xdd
[11:58:00] Mafajazz: yeah they fucked it from the get go lol
[11:58:01] flackycl: i dont need to search music for grinding, just watch hydra thats it
