[0:43:12] Dzor12: @miceinmyveins Turn off mono on your headset, it bricks the audio since he changed mixers
[0:43:14] Hred5: isn't that what u want?

[0:44:48] juniper_xd: mic lines can only be used by 1 app at a time, right?
[0:44:52] srtteddy: wtf is this audio
[0:44:55] phemii: do we kinda can predict when s4 starts?
[0:45:00] simplygabe22ofc: @Maximum There is an option called Cue Outputs with an menu
[0:45:00] xensemusic: you have to install a ASIO LINK PRO, i have the same issue
[0:45:11] skunzy_: its like you are coming through on the wrong channel on surround sound or something
[0:45:12] roookai: mic sending as stereo
[0:45:15] Hred5: There is an option called Cue Outputs with an menu
[0:45:41] HilasPrime: does anyone knows what desktop background he has ?
[0:45:41] DaSeegs: Audio channels maybe?
[0:45:41] simplygabe22ofc: try mono on obs again

[0:46:02] Hred5: next to the "aux mono"
[0:46:09] Docaan: @The_Nicaraguan it feels like an ASMR, maybe this is intentional and Max gonna whisper sweet things to chat for valentine's day

[0:46:16] Hred5: I mean try it
[0:46:17] simplygabe22ofc: yeeee
[0:46:18] AnesthesiaFC: @HilasPrime steam program called wallpaper engine
[0:46:20] friendshrimp: scroll down ur audio mixer in OBS

[0:46:50] TheFamilyHorde: Super wide stereo spread.
[0:46:51] goblingher: even while muted you have static sound
[0:46:51] Hred5: KEKW
[0:46:56] TattersAU: Audio is voodoo
[0:46:57] simplygabe22ofc: Obs is maybe the problem
[0:47:00] Zithix: i feel like youre standing behind me a bit
[0:47:02] roookai: output mono doesnt work?
[0:47:04] RobNXS: this looks like a fruity loops studio plug in haha
[0:47:12] Hred5: I wonder if the OBS is the problem honestly
[0:47:12] simplygabe22ofc: I loved it for my music work but i never used it for obs
[0:47:22] xensemusic: i think it's OBS because your output has same level of L/R
[0:47:23] asd123qwerty1: I would look into obs instead of uad since discord works
[0:47:25] Nichts2187: You can scroll down in the audiomixer in obs
[0:47:27] skunzy_: i swear it sounds like you are coming in on the wrong surround sound channel
[0:47:29] friendshrimp: scroll down
[0:47:31] xanleronwm: aight man I gotta leave the audio legit makes me dizzy
[0:47:39] Hred5: @xanleronwm  KEKW
[0:47:39] xensemusic: but UAD is pain to use with windows
[0:47:40] Zithix: its like youre voice is only on the lower half of my headphones if that makes sense lmao
[0:48:00] roookai: can you open your microphone in your device settings?
[0:48:10] RobNXS: holy dog noises comming in LOUD
[0:48:21] Docaan: New people gonna come to the stream and ask about the audio LUL

[0:48:30] booznoon: dual mono
[0:48:46] sebastian___96: Cant hear you Sadge
[0:48:47] Toointro: i just hear like a small dog whistle sound but barely

[0:48:58] yooyoo1337: I wonder what hes saying
[0:48:59] Hred5: I mean can you try obs on mono? idk man
[0:49:09] goblingher: The dog licking sounds and shakes, sounds so ambient
[0:49:10] poroyou: If I listen with just one ear in, its totally normal
[0:49:12] mycho_: bro is deep in my ear canals rn get out
[0:49:15] itsrhinobruh: is this a new silent max bit
[0:49:19] magemaster225: why dont you put the wire into mic line 1?
[0:49:23] TheFamilyHorde: The gears under your audio channels in OBS
[0:49:23] Docaan: U can make a clip and make command !audio in title
[0:49:25] XaelXXI: You are on the right side talking to me
[0:49:32] itsrhinobruh: im so sorry thats a 1 guy bit
[0:49:34] juniper_xd: you're not silent. i hear you just fine
[0:49:34] Joneim: Depends on their audio set-ups
[0:49:36] Mecabeast: youre fine for me
[0:49:38] Mythos24: Maybe there's a simulate surround sound setting somewhere to broadcast across all channels no matter the input
[0:49:43] Hred5: are u using stereo or mono for audio on OBS on your stremaing pc??
[0:49:45] Nichts2187: Tbf, im on mobile, i cant hear any difference left/right KEKW
[0:49:46] RobNXS: So when I was using my blutooth speaker I could not hear stream, switched to headphones and can hear

[0:51:09] Hred5: also what I meant max was setting your STREAMING pc to mono not your gaming one
[0:51:11] richardmu: this sound is so weird
[0:51:16] Nichts2187: Maybe wrong line selected in obs for mic?
[0:51:22] simplygabe22ofc: right > show > aux
[0:51:26] heat31: I will say, this audio makes you stand out in my ADHD 4 windows playing sounds
[0:51:27] TheFamilyHorde: Don't have to turn off stream
[0:51:32] TheFamilyHorde: It's under advanced audio properties.

[0:53:56] Hred5: and seing if that works? idk
[0:53:57] xensemusic: don't forgot that it's console > Windows > App with UAD
[0:54:01] xensemusic: it could be windows
[0:54:28] TheFamilyHorde: I'd say just turn on some 30 Seconds to Mars and rock with it.
[0:54:29] olbaid957: it feels like ASMR stream right now
[0:54:40] Docaan: my mind adapted to this audio and now I don't remember what normal audio sounds like

[0:54:58] Hred5: @Docaan bro preach lmfao

[0:55:30] mycho_: @Haydenk you're crazy sorry
[0:55:37] Hred5: gabe PauseChamp
[0:55:53] Jazzarus_: @Maximum It's not the Mic, the music you had in the intro had the same problem!

[0:57:11] Hred5: gabe typing up a testament
[0:57:17] simplygabe22ofc: when u put line 3/4 and mono it should work > it works on mine
[0:57:20] Slapsstick: @Nichts2187 its the cable from the box to the pc, so it affects everything
[0:57:23] maxmagee: but I would do that when everything else works
[0:57:28] majkdragon: doggo's goin to town on squeaky toy
[0:57:49] Nichts2187: Why not get another cable? LUL

[1:00:03] shootbuckets101: How are you doing?

[1:00:07] Somizzle: To change it to stereo
[1:00:15] simplygabe22ofc: inserts
[1:00:18] simplygabe22ofc: inputs
[1:00:21] simplygabe22ofc: there is an eq
[1:00:31] TheTerror87: does obs have access to the mic under windows privacy and settings?
[1:00:34] Oxytosin_TV: why are you inside my head
[1:00:35] simplygabe22ofc: Inserts must be the plugin option
[1:00:38] goblingher: @Watermyrain1 RIPBOZO
[1:00:42] booznoon: inserts, then one of the plusses
[1:00:49] mycho_: @Watermyrain1  SCHIZO

[1:01:17] juniper_xd: have you tried just telling it to work correctly?
[1:01:30] maxmagee: thats all the plugins KEKW

[1:01:55] Itsimprov: can you right click where it says analog 1 and change to line 3/4 ?
[1:01:56] iTsGRANT: because it's made for giganerds
[1:01:57] Ruinx81: That is a pro interface for music recording
[1:02:07] OsyrissTV: beacn creative is made by the same people who invented goXLR, they left the old company @Maximum
[1:02:09] mycho_: yea sounds great man
[1:02:12] oAtlas: I like the one called Little Labs
[1:02:12] booznoon: all the eq's here are based on analog eq's from the music industry
[1:02:12] Zithix: fuck it just add autotune and lets roll
[1:02:18] xensemusic: UAD is not the best/most optimal for windows. As a producer I can tell you that haha
[1:02:19] mycho_: @Zithix THIS ^^
[1:02:24] sillyman29: kinda used to it now
[1:02:25] mycho_: hit those notes
[1:02:25] MBG_95: where you clicked equalizer there was also microphone as a drop down
[1:02:27] Docaan: LUL
[1:02:28] Voyburke: Probably because there's a pic of a guitar on your device and not a joystick lol
[1:02:32] JustinFromFlorida: Nothing sounds different to me. Idk what the issue is.
[1:02:41] MVPBuster: get scammed PepeLaugh
[1:02:41] Archerone: If you can't make it right, make it intentional
[1:02:42] theweirdsquiggly: how long has he been at this?
[1:02:44] OG_Kawngi: EZ baited
[1:02:44] MBG_95: I swear you got one guy'd into buying this
[1:02:48] bevo70: factor
[1:02:52] justleggo: got em
[1:02:57] TerribleToller: Money is no object for your stream setup
[1:02:59] misran: you have no choice now, for max value you need to learn guitar
[1:03:01] BigTrout3: hold up, how many chatters do you think ACTUALLY do anything with audio??
[1:03:03] xensemusic: its mostly used for music producers, hence why all the plugins
[1:03:07] mycho_: idk shit about audio i plug my earbuds into pc n game
[1:03:10] vaironixx: where are the people who said to get it? why cant they help? kekw
[1:03:11] surpriseparty20: doodGG
[1:03:15] Docaan: the one guy got his friends to join in
[1:03:18] itsgamz: Prove it
[1:03:19] Slapsstick: I listen to audio so im qualified Kappa
[1:03:22] booznoon: the UAD would really be used for recording music, i want one lol
[1:03:23] jonn_bonn: play
[1:03:25] MBG_95: Music stream 0.o
[1:03:27] oAtlas: your mic sounds great, if it was just in my ears not inside my skull it would be perfect
[1:03:28] porongochee: catsittingverycomfortablearoundacampfirewithitsfriends
[1:03:41] Zithix: hot cross buns goes hard
[1:03:46] bearded__dad: bearded__dad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[1:03:48] simplygabe22ofc: the best way is to use the other cable, there is a workaround and i have an older version of the software
[1:03:52] mycho_: dog foot goin sicko mode
[1:04:10] TheFamilyHorde: Bricked up.
[1:04:14] RobNXS: can you drag right side of console to the left to make console window smaller, way too big
[1:04:16] simplygabe22ofc: so i cant find something and im fucking tired :D im in eu :D
[1:04:17] Somizzle: My google-fu tells me that you should right-click that "Analog 1" and click "Link". Other option would be to duplicate your line 3 to another output then link them together.
[1:04:18] misran: basically you're trying to figure out how to drive a car on 3 wheels when the answer is to just get a 4th wheel
[1:04:25] chimneybob: did you already buy it?
[1:04:46] simplygabe22ofc: but ur mic is nice
[1:04:55] Voyburke: put in streaming setup or something
[1:04:56] OG_Kawngi: it's for lifting your clouds ok
[1:04:58] mycho_: i blow clouds and get lifted
[1:05:02] surpriseparty20: If the tutorial is not made by an Indian guy I don't trust it Kappa
[1:05:28] MBG_95: his video is 1min 40
[1:05:32] maxmagee: people use 10k microphones on these things. It has to have some power KEKW
[1:05:38] Joneim: yuh
[1:05:40] toastbam: yes
[1:05:41] xensemusic: yep haha
[1:05:41] mycho_: switch to mac EZ
[1:05:42] Ruinx81: Thunderbolt
[1:05:46] juniper_xd: made for max xD
[1:05:51] xxpurplehazen: made for max Pog
[1:06:03] mycho_: tam abernathy got the info for sure
[1:06:07] Zithix: shows you already started watching that vid lmao
[1:06:13] oAtlas: just starting singing
[1:06:19] simplygabe22ofc: one stupid question :D u use the headphone output ?
[1:06:37] misran: looks like the official UA channel has some tutorials
[1:06:45] simplygabe22ofc: ok this would be an workaround too
[1:06:55] Docaan: If i get that I would probably turn the knob around and pretend I am a DJ
[1:07:11] Linith_Heart: oh god your audio is louder in the left ear
[1:07:17] BigTrout3: well so much for watching a tutorial
[1:07:33] simplygabe22ofc: it was funny haha :D now im going to sleep @Maximum and have a great time @Chat
[1:07:38] juniper_xd: can you just add a new mic input to that obs and see if it picks it up then? could just be a weird software glitch.
[1:07:51] Docaan: @simplygabe22ofc Valiant effort gabe
[1:07:56] mycho_: sleep tight gabe
[1:08:00] Itsimprov: could you not make it into 2 channels and pan one left and one right ?
[1:08:10] juniper_xd: worth a shot. yeah weirld
[1:08:36] juniper_xd: he probably meant run as admin
[1:08:55] hotdogmartyr: why does audio sound so weird
[1:08:57] mooocho: are nightborne priests cool
[1:09:03] juniper_xd: i don't see why that would fix it, but just guessing that's what he meant
[1:09:11] Docaan: If anything tyler1 proves audio isn't mandatory with his scuffed mic
[1:09:19] dustin_handsupdb: currently on a studio setup: theres a volume difference and a latency difference left to right I'm getting wicked comb filtering
[1:09:26] y0mii: wait why do u have a goxlr and apollo interface?
[1:09:30] dustin_handsupdb: Is the cable plugged in fully
[1:09:31] SoulEdg3: tyler1 goated audio

[1:10:31] Onyo1337: Looking
[1:10:31] Docaan: ngl though it's fun
[1:10:32] CptReymious: @dustin_handsupdb he needs a splitter for his plugin on the back the set up so ur only getting 1 soundf channel
[1:10:36] theweirdsquiggly: max looking at cox on twitch smh
[1:11:03] zolado_: U sound like u inside my head
[1:11:04] ktthemage: Equipmonk
[1:11:10] AoPsyke: woah wtf. Bassy voice
[1:11:20] Ruinx81: Min into xlr use usb c
[1:11:24] daevyfan: it adds some charm to the stream imo
[1:11:29] razzzz6: wow thats a nice audio interface tho
[1:11:30] Ripxuzi: new audio quality sounds like you are speaking my thoughts
[1:11:33] stelfbronco: are you going to look at the MDI trailer!
[1:11:33] bglpuppy2: damn this audio quality is so good
[1:11:33] xensemusic: the quality is great though
[1:11:34] NickyNiclas: Yea why not USB?
[1:11:39] itsgerald2k: bro this sound massaging the back of my head. what is this @Maximum
[1:11:46] shea4it: ban anyone who says "audio" "weird" or, actually just ban everyone
[1:11:49] antipheonixna: mute chat so we both are fucked

[1:12:25] GrimFandango: don't Kalamazi and Jak have those mics?
[1:12:31] RobNXS: Yeah i've got a beacn mic and it sounds p good
[1:12:40] Ripxuzi: ill try tomorrow when you get this fixed
[1:13:03] roookai: he likes to smell his own farts is what ur tryna say
[1:13:12] chimneybob: their software still needs polishing
[1:13:18] jaco163: Good luck with your stream, at least we know you're alive
[1:13:28] RobNXS: yeah it's just USB c
[1:13:39] brodieman2: USB c only
[1:13:43] RobNXS: Mic is also USB c
[1:13:43] dustin_handsupdb: Their interfaces definitely cannot drive your HD 800s
[1:13:55] RobNXS: yeah, it's handled through beacn software
[1:13:56] brodieman2: meant for their mic
[1:14:05] pseudobudo: that's a separate mixer. the mic has it's own processing on it
[1:14:08] chimneybob: its bsically just a volume controller for different sources
[1:14:14] NickyNiclas: Gimmicky for sure
[1:14:16] xensemusic: meh, USB mic will never sound as good as SM7B
[1:14:17] x_Baggers: that looks like a fisher price toy

[1:15:06] slowfetch: shit
[1:15:07] pseudobudo: yeah, buy the sm7db instead
[1:15:12] SoulEdg3: tyler1 says hello
[1:15:16] vaironixx: tyler1 as evidence
[1:15:16] NickyNiclas: @xensemusic You can use a USB interface for SM7b and it sounds great so USB is not a factor
[1:15:21] yaboyandel: nickmercs the perfect example. 50k subs and dude used a $40 headset lol
[1:15:23] TheTazzyBoy: Ima pull the T1 and only use a logitech headset mic
[1:15:34] slowfetch: i just spent my savings on a mic because i thought it would make me have a personality
[1:15:36] SoulEdg3: shitty mic = god status
[1:15:37] roookai: true
[1:15:54] dustin_handsupdb: @xensemusic Give me an Elgate Wave and I'll give you an SM7B and a shit interface. We'll see who can make it sound better.
[1:16:00] demepunkk: jynxzi as well
[1:16:05] RobNXS: yeah beacn mic just has usb c out and headphones in on bottom of mic
[1:16:05] gnawlix: @slowfetch and what was the outcome? maximumBeak
[1:16:06] Mecabeast: i really like the blue mini as a starter mic over literally any headset mic
[1:16:13] vaironixx: darthmicrotransaction just broke his goxlr and had to get a friends old one
[1:16:15] luxumbra69: blue yeti from before logitech. pepega
[1:16:19] pseudobudo: apparently the beacn was made by the people who were working on the goXLR
[1:16:22] Docaan: I always heard about them from streamers, surprised they went out of business
[1:16:48] TeamLiquid: Interested in purchasing a Mythic Amirdrassil, the Dreams Hope boost with Team Liquid? Head over to go.adv.gg/4XuCPI for pricing and to schedule a run! (Gold Only)
[1:17:05] xensemusic: @dustin_handsupdb haha im up for the challenge! I have a SM7B & UAD interface though so
[1:17:10] agnarz: lirik is such an exception
[1:17:29] gnawlix: Lirik is only good at slither R)
[1:17:41] TenFatties: yo max I’m watching on my phone, I can’t hear u with my headphones but if I go to speaker I hear u fine

[1:20:37] Archerone: No cam
[1:20:38] xxpurplehazen: Ben bla
[1:20:42] Joneim: He was at 12-15k when he was bossing during the Gauntlet
[1:20:42] asd123qwerty1: @maximum do you think ben is coming back for a war within Prayge
[1:20:44] vaironixx: ben is actually the best play in poe
[1:20:47] Joneim: Ben said bla
[1:20:47] vaironixx: player
[1:20:54] surpriseparty20: He doesn't have any drama around him for so its not interesting for those idiots LUL
[1:20:57] dustin_handsupdb: Ben literally has more viewers than Max right now
[1:20:58] vaironixx: Garf to the max
[1:21:02] Bwandin_: maybe the name switch
[1:21:04] SyMmBoLz: POE GOD!

[1:22:43] goblingher: @mentoku thx
[1:22:49] JakeParkbench: Just a merc for the team
[1:22:58] vaironixx: i think its definitely worth it to have ben
[1:23:23] Ifwuzzy: are you guys raiding daily?
[1:23:34] vaironixx: yeah letting a few players be the exception
[1:23:38] NickyNiclas: makes sense
[1:23:39] xilrasis1: Ben was concerned about basically the same thing
[1:23:43] jvmes_r6: imagine if this was rwf right now lol max would be livid
[1:23:49] Docaan: yea
[1:23:49] vaironixx: getting away with just only doing the bare minumum
[1:23:51] gnawlix: if that’s the problem then people need to leave there egos at the door lol
[1:23:51] RobNXS: makes sense when thinking about time commitment
[1:23:55] gnawlix: their
[1:23:57] Slapsstick: thats fair, but as long as they are all close then its usually fine since theres less ego there
[1:23:58] PrimeDamage_: this audio sounds weird on speakers
[1:24:02] corebitz: OMG YOU SOUND SO CRISP MAX
[1:24:03] theGNL: are you inside my head now?
[1:24:05] surpriseparty20: It absolutely makes sense
[1:24:05] vaironixx: i doubt ben would want to be that guy as well
[1:24:11] izzyx_tv: this audio sounds weird in general
[1:24:15] pnguinwow: bro you are deep in my skull
[1:24:21] corebitz: I love this audio
[1:24:22] flicqt: @Maximum your audio is heavy on the right
[1:24:23] Greytness: thats why trill said he wouldnt participate in the race. he didnt want to have so many toons
[1:24:28] valarbravoosi: if the less characters is a matter of need and not want (i.e. time issues) than it'd be more accepted probably quinThinking
[1:24:32] jvmes_r6: i can hear audio through my phone i cant hear anything on my pc
[1:24:33] Kippereno: yeah the audio is a little weird idk
[1:24:38] malicrin: I want to be that guy. sub me in
[1:24:39] cannibalcanyon: @flicqt i thought this was just me LUL
[1:24:45] EpixsTheGamer: audio sucks
[1:24:51] Xilicks: it does sound weird
[1:25:00] cannibalcanyon: i though he was showing something with this mic LOL
[1:25:00] misran: he knows about the audio chat
[1:25:02] ezpz_viscous: the audio is kind of making me sick
[1:25:07] ezpz_viscous: its neat lol
[1:25:13] ziggy23: Why you sound like your talking from behind me
[1:25:14] Joneim: @ezpz_viscous dw, its getting fixed for next stream

[1:25:26] CrispDude: so true max
[1:25:27] surpriseparty20: What dps would u like Ben to play ?
[1:25:29] Basic_3: Do you see the mirror issue getting worse or better in TWW? Same?
[1:25:31] gnawlix: that’s why there is a hierarchy of talent, people shouldn’t get egod
[1:25:36] xxpurplehazen: the audio isnt even that bad anymore
[1:25:38] xxpurplehazen: ok
[1:25:38] Readyforbagels: sounds like you're below me
[1:25:41] valarbravoosi: ok
[1:25:41] glitsmonk: you sound good
[1:25:41] ShishoPoe: it aint even that bad
[1:25:42] flicqt: I just joined so I thought I let you know about it being heavy right ok
[1:25:42] glitsmonk: crisp
[1:25:43] ottermatic69: reading the morning announcements at school flow
[1:25:43] Hoshma46: no :)
[1:25:43] Ifwuzzy: i like it
[1:25:45] Joneim: ok
[1:25:45] Basic_3: It seems like Liquid/Echo are racing to the bottom with making unsustainable numbers of alts.
[1:25:46] Ifwuzzy: you're inside of me
[1:25:49] ezpz_viscous: its like really interesting though
[1:25:49] bigsbe: it sounds fine to me
[1:25:50] Docaan: sounds like a headache being raid leader managing people
[1:25:51] pent217: Audio is 100% fine
[1:25:51] ezpz_viscous: how the sound hits
[1:25:56] dustin_handsupdb: Depends how Warbands work
[1:25:57] goblingher: The sound is fine now
[1:26:09] CrispDude: yea it sounds great honestly keep it as is
[1:26:10] Lindorn_: Chatting surely im the first one to type this audio bit, ima go for it
[1:26:20] flicqt: heavy left now
[1:26:25] flicqt: back to right
[1:26:27] flicqt: KEKW
[1:26:32] Basic_3: It's a weird issue because it's literally only like top 10 guilds that do it
[1:26:42] bigsbe: I wonder if warbands will have interesting impacts on the race
[1:26:42] Byggareebob: def not top 10
[1:26:46] Byggareebob: top 5 maybe if even
[1:26:56] flicqt: thats pretty center did you adjust anything
[1:27:03] Basic_3: The "pact" solution
[1:27:07] Hoshma46: KEKW
[1:27:07] Docaan: LUL
[1:27:15] ottermatic69: it would never happen people always want the edge
[1:27:16] vaironixx: someone is gonna no life it
[1:27:16] Kippereno: Wait so why is so many characters better?
[1:27:20] Basic_3: Do a carve-out for THD as a freak
[1:27:23] jaynkumz: thd
[1:27:32] DanteDemonZ: gentlemens agreement
[1:27:34] Denz_9: you need to hire gromnak as commissioner
[1:27:38] Joneim: xdd
[1:27:40] Docaan: THD
[1:27:40] Pyrrha_GG: you just dont bring the extras into raid
[1:27:41] TattersAU: xdd
[1:27:45] Basic_3: @Kippereno They kill heroic Fyrakk 25 times on week 1 because of gear allocation. That's why.
[1:28:08] Pyrrha_GG: yeah would require everyone to stream publicly
[1:28:09] AoPsyke: @Kippereno and to add, allows to guarantee proper itemization
[1:28:10] Galinnyr: I mean you can make more than 4, just before the race you need to pick 4
[1:28:12] flicqt: giga alts is annoying though no?
[1:28:15] dango0n: bro, it sounds like Im in a zoom meeting
[1:28:16] nnikitous: Hi, Max! Nice sound @Maximum
[1:28:18] TattersAU: First tier of an expac is always best for the huge gear gap imo
[1:28:28] xxpurplehazen: my fingers were crossed xdd
[1:28:29] BizzlexJB: wait, wtf with audio???
[1:28:29] TattersAU: for race *
[1:28:30] BigTrout3: RWF addon developed my third party? PauseChamp a la Hardcore classic before hardcore servers?
[1:28:35] notahotd0g: RWF only server, only limited character copies. WF is only judged on that server
[1:29:02] CrispDude: Hey max! big fan and this new mic sounds so clean
[1:29:02] Mezzedii: more accounts KEKW
[1:29:08] Machine42593: so the most boring race ever lol
[1:29:09] glitsmonk: are you going to try last epoch later this month?
[1:29:09] johnnboitoi: Imagine a raid guild lockout instead of player lockout

[1:29:59] surpriseparty20: LUL*
[1:30:00] Byggareebob: you would be surprised max we are the minority people dont like heroic week
[1:30:09] Joneim: Heroic week with unlocked M+ would bang
[1:30:11] tehspudder: @Pwndepot1982 limiting what you can get on an account just means they'll just buy more accounts
[1:30:18] N3llee: am i high.. no sound?
[1:30:23] Mezzedii: quit his job
[1:30:31] Pwndepot1982: yeah
[1:30:33] CrispDude: @N3llee try refreshing browser
[1:30:35] jberry: @N3llee baked brother
[1:30:35] Choice_au: the current release schedule is already taxing guys abilities to take time off
[1:30:35] Joneim: @N3llee Audio will be fixed by next stream, its wild atm
[1:30:36] GrimFandango: which mark is this?
[1:30:49] Xesevi: 3 days of splits > 7 days of splits

[1:31:49] flavienbx: yeah weirdness confirmed after refresh
[1:31:52] Teepone: @Maximum Put some subway surfers gameplay on whilst you talk to chat. My attention span ontop of this audio ain't working.
[1:31:54] Evcon_: (Terrible take incoming) just don't do splits. Progress natty like back in 2004.
[1:32:02] Dreww_P: @Teepone LOL
[1:32:08] johnnboitoi: splits will be a thing until a guild goes in and clears mythic without a single split
[1:32:10] CrispDude: @flavienbx it might be your headphones, maybe buy a new pair
[1:32:14] johnnboitoi: Which will probably never happen
[1:32:18] Lindorn_: LUL
[1:32:20] Hoshma46: xdd
[1:32:21] vaironixx: KEKW that happens every race

[1:32:52] Jazrial: Would you participate if the RWF was hosted on the tournament realm?
[1:32:57] misran: so like the average sports fan xdd
[1:32:58] vaironixx: we just know GO USA haha
[1:33:00] RobNXS: my take is USA > EU deal with it nerds
[1:33:05] basherbash32: Not like it comes with a handbook
[1:33:05] hattori718: I feel like I'm listening with 3D surround on but it's not weird
[1:33:07] yawgmothsupp: Everyones always worried about another EN, though thats impossible now
[1:33:34] Mezzedii: that was so annoying
[1:33:49] Joneim: LOGIN
[1:33:54] Zaisx: LOGIN
[1:33:55] Joneim: garf
[1:34:07] surpriseparty20: There are some people that no matter how many times u explain something to them they are still gonna be clueless/have shitty takes
[1:34:07] Docaan: I was surprised by that as well, but then I remembered they got a lot of casuals with their marketing
[1:34:14] aden_potato: @Maximum you gonna play some last epoch?
[1:34:17] TattersAU: POE is just reaching a critical point, then you wont look back
[1:34:40] Criarcy: why does your voice sound like its coming from behind me
[1:34:49] Zaisx: I'm a casual who enjoys PoE
[1:34:50] Docaan: True
[1:34:56] Dreww_P: @Criarcy turn around
[1:35:06] Criarcy: @Criarcy bet
[1:35:13] Docaan: prob those customers gonna keep playing whether the opinions on the game good or bad
[1:35:19] Mezzedii: ssf poe is the real hard stuff trade is easier
[1:35:22] Rictamar: Last Epoch though, a nice middle ground pog
[1:35:24] GirlNinja: wow mic sounds so clear
[1:35:31] Baskkov: he hasnt streamed for ages
[1:35:34] hattori718: He is not streaming
[1:35:35] EdBoy_: LOGIN
[1:35:52] TomaHawK_The_One: tough it was a single player game?
[1:35:59] hattori718: Pretty sure that is exactly what he is busy with
[1:36:07] Joneim: @TomaHawK_The_One Nah its been multiplayer since last year
[1:36:11] antipheonixna: @Maximum what if mythic bosses gave a bit more loot would that cut down, or higher ilv for higher lv keys?
[1:36:17] Mrjakoby2001: hows Horseboy doing?
[1:36:34] Kourk: yo wtf ur in my head now compared to the past :O
[1:36:42] vaironixx: HUH
[1:36:49] Docaan: LUL
[1:36:54] JustJoshin____: lay off the weed bro
[1:36:57] ThisIzD: Dentge
[1:37:19] shoneshaman: I feel like you moved in my headset
[1:37:25] shoneshaman: Like now you're in the background
[1:37:29] DanteDemonZ: idk how I feel about it
[1:37:32] vitaax13: Why do wow bosses need so many nerfs compared to ffxiv?
[1:37:33] Baskkov: thats only fyrakk mythic trinkets
[1:37:54] ottermatic69: its fine for one characters it becomes ass with more alts
[1:37:58] hattori718: I still think we could use a few less M+ required for vault
[1:37:58] zukohonor: gear boring though :/
[1:37:59] Morinik: Hey Max, are you having an MDI watch party?
[1:38:06] GrimFandango: we need a late season crest increase, like 3x
[1:38:11] zeckzeckzeck: vault targeting slots
[1:38:22] BloodSick_PT: except weekly caps NotLikeThis  let me just no life as i want
[1:38:32] TattersAU: Still surprised they havent done a trinket token system for bad luck protection
[1:38:44] hexlol_: ban for vaults
[1:38:46] Hoshma46: random tertiary from vault tokens would be rad
[1:38:48] roguerhino: that would actually be so much better
[1:38:49] AoPsyke: Just been trying to get nymue staff since week one from raid or vault. nada
[1:38:51] Linith_Heart: forcing non-raiders to raid mythic to play M+ feels bad
[1:38:52] TattersAU: Still trying to get Augery Madge
[1:38:56] yaboiamsung: i thought my headphones were broken because of new audio lmao
[1:39:03] Slapsstick: still havent seen the Cheat trinket from DOTI Sadge
[1:39:14] JustJoshin____: trinket protection pls blizzard
[1:39:16] braillz: Sounds like ur third partying me
[1:39:18] DanteDemonZ: @AoPsyke same bro, I have myth nymue trinket, but staff doesnt exist for me it sucks
[1:39:24] Pyrrha_GG: pinned message?
[1:39:28] Joneim: Big header "MICROPHONE IS FUCKED"
[1:39:29] AoPsyke: big ass paint message
[1:39:33] bigtony466: Change Stream Title maybe?
[1:39:41] Evcon_: I'd be happy with vault just giving Dinars and picking items off vendor from the beginning of season.
[1:39:44] AoPsyke: @AoPsyke ya fr.
[1:39:44] Docaan: Putting a text on screen with "I know there are audio issues, it will be fixed next stream"
[1:39:45] ThisIzD: Just got here and I feel like im listening to max in 10D audio
[1:39:47] Docaan: oh there it is
[1:39:49] vaironixx: put it right in the middle
[1:39:54] flicqt: audio is good if I use one ear
[1:39:57] flicqt: Pog

[1:40:43] vaironixx: no one is going to read that

[1:40:48] flicqt: KEKW
[1:40:55] hattori718: Lol it really does
[1:40:55] aden_potato: @Maximum ive been enjoying last epoch a lot lately don't need a phd to enjoy it like poe but still more stuff then diablo 4
[1:40:57] jberry: sounds like ur behind me wtf
[1:41:03] ThisIzD: HES IN OUR WALLS
[1:41:04] d1ehardy: gonna have nightmares for weeks
[1:41:06] Hoshma46: WOW IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE BEHIND ME BatChest
[1:41:14] aden_potato: yup
[1:41:16] DecayingPopcorn: just tell people to put their headset the other way around
[1:41:19] PizzaPizzaV34: I suspect he's saying, "Watch the frontal.  Blaze in 3...2...1...".
[1:41:20] SirScizor2020: luckily im a bit hard of hearing and cant hear anything wrong with the audio
[1:41:25] vaironixx: sounds like jerry garcia's in my head maaaan
[1:41:28] ThisIzD: WAYTOODANK
[1:41:28] Evcon_: It does sound like you are whispering all the right things in my ear on valentines day. No complaints.
[1:41:32] Docaan: yea was just about to say that
[1:41:35] Aejique: I kinda like it. I'm listening to like 3 things at once and the audio being like this makes it easier to separate him from the others
[1:41:39] tehspudder: tehspudder subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 20 month streak! doggoArrive
[1:41:39] swftrrr: it feels like he is inside me... and i like it
[1:41:44] jberry: ?
[1:41:45] Docaan: it's 10 years behind in terms of content compared to POE
[1:42:00] RhoSigmaPhi: I only play D4 couch co-op lol
[1:42:00] dika93: D4 BAD
[1:42:01] vaironixx: no the leaderboards is shit, i dont even wanna play it
[1:42:04] hattori718: So if you sound 3D and I put you on my 3D sound system then do you become 6D? LUL
[1:42:06] Joneim: d4
[1:42:11] D4RD4N: there's more endgame in last epoch than d4 rn, thou it's not enough
[1:42:13] Dakhaos: D4 is dead
[1:42:21] Tigerklaue: even the biggest d4 streamer dont stream d4 anymore
[1:42:30] JustJoshin____: @hattori718 9D i think
[1:42:30] ottermatic69: diablo is always fun for a week then you move on til the next time
[1:42:38] misran: i mean they thought we'd want to re-click lilith statues every season so nothing surprises me
[1:42:39] vaironixx: in poe theres so many things to shoot for
[1:42:44] ThisIzD: Even Datmodz said they should just wait until they can release it with a progression event.
[1:42:47] pinealpro: so how do i fix max sounding like he's only in my left ear
[1:42:49] vaironixx: ubers, map clears, item chases, so many things
[1:42:59] Slapsstick: @pinealpro top screen
[1:43:01] roguerhino: @pinealpro you cant
[1:43:16] Tigerklaue: but we get shop updates every week!
[1:43:22] Joneim: Lillith is still harder than any of the uber bosses by a mile
[1:43:28] Evcon_: They also probably fired 90% of the people who originally made Diablo 4.
[1:43:30] GrimFandango: $90 cosmetics btw haHAA
[1:43:32] pinealpro: im blind
[1:43:37] TattersAU: I remember Shak + IFU grinding Lilith for days
[1:43:41] dubbyatt: lillith tricked me into thinking d4 would be sick
[1:44:00] bluntlol: Hey Max, I am not sure but I think there is something wrong with your audio
[1:44:02] zeckzeckzeck: minecraft
[1:44:03] Baskkov: depends on the game
[1:44:09] RhoSigmaPhi: Yes, d4 is a big success, and it's for casuals on console
[1:44:11] bluntlol: smile
[1:44:13] Krulani: what's making this audio make my ears tingle?
[1:44:16] planooooooooooooooooooooo: max your voice is coming from inside my head monkaS
[1:44:17] ZombFeed: mobile games

[1:44:25] RobNXS: whats that nintendo game? with plants and stuff
[1:44:27] Joneim: Nah, you kill any of the jingly key gamers aspirations
[1:44:27] Docaan: that is genshin impact and Honkai star rail audience
[1:44:28] antipheonixna: as a live service, pc games hell no i think
[1:44:36] zeckzeckzeck: minecraft is that
[1:44:36] x_Baggers: they cant compete with poe on that front, they needed to aim for babygamers
[1:44:36] Archerone: Sims
[1:44:48] vitaax13: Genshin has no challenging stuff and its huge
[1:44:48] vaironixx: no there should always be some sort of challenge for people
[1:44:51] Joneim: 90% of the people who play poe dream of farming Uber bosses in Poe, its called aspirational content for a reason
[1:44:53] vaironixx: even if its not the top challenge
[1:44:57] ZombFeed: minecraft
[1:45:13] vaironixx: yeah poe has so many things to aim for
[1:45:25] Mecabeast: I like my first play through to be on the highest difficulty not the biggest fan of replaying game
[1:45:32] PJs_Banana: I like my challenge in racing games, everything else i play on easy just to enjoy it
[1:45:38] vaironixx: even if you are casual in poe you can aim for just completing campaign, and it gets harder from there
[1:45:48] Baskkov: dont think you can make a game without at least some challenge successfull
[1:45:49] aden_potato: they have leaderboards i think for endgame stuff
[1:45:52] eionsx: Sadge
[1:45:54] panta_xdd: in poe if you overgear you just one shot every boss
[1:45:56] antipheonixna: i mean the historic biggest games is wow lol valor csgo ppl care about competition even if they are meh or casual
[1:46:19] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Madge
[1:46:22] Joneim: Gamers need dreams and goals
[1:46:23] pokirane: we're entering baseg
[1:46:32] ThisIzD: just make some hard bosses. i dont think casuals will care if they cant kill the hardest bosses. I dont mythic raid and I still log into wow every patch.
[1:46:42] Mezzedii: because they actually play the gaame
[1:46:52] Denz_9: Chris Wilson just gets it
[1:47:01] vaironixx: yeah he is confident, so is the poe 2 guy jonathan, they are both really smart and you can tell they know what they are doing and want to do
[1:47:08] Joneim: Some of the recent Poe 2 interviews have been amazing as well
[1:47:09] antipheonixna: mortdog
[1:47:10] Thasin22: rod and joe need to be kicked off the d4
[1:47:23] Jazzarus_: I know you're not a pvper, but the BG Blitz is the most fun pvp mode atm, can't wait for it to be rated.
[1:47:37] flicqt: AAA studios are extremely out of touch with the audience and have some skewed relationship with their communities, D4 started strong with the community aspect, but are falling very quickly because of them being out of touch or reacting to extreme measures to appease this view of "too challenging"
[1:47:38] hexlol_: They dont
[1:47:45] vaironixx: it feels like they havent played a game
[1:47:54] panta_xdd: D4 doing bad will make Poe2 blow up big time
[1:48:03] unexpected070: Kinda feels like they themselves are jingly keys baby gamers
[1:48:06] Tigerklaue: the d4 devs saying "vaults are fun"
[1:48:09] planooooooooooooooooooooo: the stuff they mention as game highlights has nothing to do with why people play(ed) diablo to begin with
[1:48:19] ThisIzD: they dont. clearly by the way the game is going. They had success with season 2 and then just shit all over season 3 like they learned nothing.
[1:48:28] BuffElePls: max is talking inside me yum
[1:48:29] vaironixx: @planooooooooooooooooooooo this
[1:48:29] Zaisx: successful from a sales perspective donest mean its successful from a game design perspective idk
[1:48:32] RobNXS: What. you don't have a cell phone?
[1:48:45] vaironixx: there are 2 teams i guess
[1:48:46] mycho_: there's 2 team allegedly
[1:48:47] dika93: problem is they will "fix" D4 with a 70$ paid expansion
[1:48:55] andrankr: AHHH      My ears, what happened here?
[1:48:55] Joneim: Yeah the campfire chats always felt off, like they were trying to appease everyone instead of just the people playing
[1:49:00] vitaax13: Lol
[1:49:03] pokirane: fixed by horse Pog
[1:49:03] roguerhino: @andrankr top screen
[1:49:04] Mezzedii: fire the odd season team then
[1:49:04] Zaisx: they said they have 2 teams for seasonal content
[1:49:05] Joneim: @andrankr Read the big black letters in the middle of the screen
[1:49:06] vaironixx: ive also heard season 3 was using season 1 build and released it with season 1 bugs
[1:49:09] imhadeen: just got into d3, d4 seems awful and im preparing to play POE if that means anything. never played anythign of them before
[1:49:10] Zaisx: which means 6 months for bare bones stuff
[1:49:11] mycho_: if season 4 is a banger we'll know for sure
[1:49:13] PJs_Banana: @andrankr issue with eyes too i see
[1:49:17] pokirane: @andrankr firstGarf
[1:49:19] surpriseparty20: If that's true then the odd season team is clueless
[1:49:27] flicqt: max have you heard of the New Egg stuff a couple years back? where Gamers Nexus did an interview with 4 executives in customer relation branches, TLDR: they kept using big strong appealing words, but it meant nothing in the overall spectrum, D4 devs do this
[1:50:04] vaironixx: gamersnexus is good stuff
[1:50:07] andrankr: I came to get knowledge I got a headache
[1:50:18] panta_xdd: imo arpgs without compouding mechanics from past seasons just get null. Devs spending so much time developing good content to throw then away couple of mounths later just sounds bad
[1:50:21] vitaax13: D4 should be f2p their monetization is crazy
[1:50:25] Darkminst: @flicqt banger of a vid btw
[1:51:04] ottermatic69: i want sets back like diablo 3 the gear is just pretty meh outside of uniques and outlier aspects
[1:51:06] vaironixx: sod phase 2
[1:51:07] flicqt: @Darkminst yeah dude I was under a rock and saw it a few days ago and caught up on all that stuff, it's pretty wild how much they let get by and basically scammed customers KEKW
[1:51:23] vaironixx: poe devs dont throw away content though
[1:51:39] Darkminst: @flicqt even GN themselfs LUL
[1:51:44] nemziac: well more like they reverted to the pre lesson learned issues
[1:51:44] Joneim: @vaironixx they definetly do
[1:51:48] Silencbank: imagine if they decided m+ was a legion only thing
[1:51:50] nemziac: somehow
[1:51:52] JustJoshin____: you just have to clean it up for new ppl
[1:51:53] vaironixx: i mean they do for some
[1:51:54] Camelbak21: I have been converted, wow needs solo m+. Tryna get into keys as a non meta class is just Sadge just wanna play maan
[1:51:59] Joneim: Poe has phased out a ton of outdated content
[1:52:01] antipheonixna: u would hope diablo would of been an arpg with the lessons wow learned and be a good live service but nah fuck it season
[1:52:14] vaironixx: @Joneim yeah but they have also kept a ton of it
[1:52:16] Ikarus_77: they just started doing that, cuz there is just to much in the game from past patches
[1:52:18] farfarofa: Thats kinda what POE does
[1:52:25] lsdeeezus: imo entire loot system is boring and bad in wow
[1:52:26] vaironixx: @vaironixx i could have a whole list right now so yeah
[1:52:28] flicqt: @Darkminst the fact that GB had taped their findings and Newegg never opened the box to see that until he pulled his following is insane to me
[1:52:30] Joneim: @Joneim Ye, but the current stuff is 95% banger content
[1:52:37] phemii: do we know roughly when season4 arrives?
[1:52:44] ottermatic69: doom brand for the doom talent in demo
[1:52:52] vaironixx: BASED
[1:52:55] Boreall: Boreall subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Hey Max, I've been watching your stream for a year now! I just wanted to tell you I've regretted every minute of it, here's to another year
[1:52:56] Joneim: Pog
[1:52:57] vaironixx: LE is looking good
[1:52:58] flicqt: Pog
[1:52:59] TheEyeVII: who's got their DUNE 2 ticket baby
