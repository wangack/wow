[2:33:30] OJWestTV: side hustle
[2:33:48] Se7enthSinn: so gathers should make lot of gold in DF?
[2:34:37] zeiours: @towelliee Have you decided which tank you're maining yet
[2:34:49] Thoreya: fury cranks
[2:34:52] captiv8: ore, herbs and skins are all region wide on the AH right? so might not be as much as you think
[2:34:52] Thoreya: and is v fun
[2:35:00] Bugszy: i have every proffession covered
[2:35:03] krozym: the only gather prof is going to make alot of gold all expansion is going to be herbalism
[2:35:07] Tjenne92: They'll be worth alot at the start
[2:35:11] Zilberg: Why they don‚Äôt allow us to have more then 2 professions always confused me
[2:35:12] Thoreya: hes maining bear obv
[2:35:14] Tjenne92: Like always
[2:35:14] Sollice: @NewWorldReign That his stock as the GOAT ( which I don't think he is thats MJ ) goes down everyday, that he got exactly what he wanted player wise, and that if he ever became a coach or owner he would have a terrible record
[2:35:23] Bugszy: and back in the old days had diff transmuters aswell
[2:35:39] Killerstorm133: Killerstorm133 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Yo @Towelliee how is the pre patch
[2:35:40] backstreetalright: You think gold inflation is relavant? Imo if its too high reduces the face value of gold
[2:35:44] Thoreya: @NewWorldReign @NewWorldReign hes 38 and putting up 30 a game
[2:35:51] Thoreya: they shud trade him and move on with their horrible franchise
[2:36:13] Sollice: Who Lebron or Westbrook?
[2:36:29] Thoreya: lbj
[2:36:38] Thoreya: and just tank with wb and AD, aint going anywhere
[2:36:40] Killerstorm133: what the 15
[2:36:53] Rottencoarse: @NewWorldReign @Sollice  dude it's so bad i watched yesterday's game it was bad. Especially the trade choices and such
[2:36:57] PvtHudson093: When does the anniversary start?
[2:37:09] qualybased: what is this oculus 2.0
[2:37:09] Rottencoarse: @Sollice Westbrick
[2:37:12] unholyagony: dungeon
[2:37:30] Killerstorm133: oh ok so this was the pre patch to the pre patch
[2:37:31] Sollice: Westbrook wont be there next year. Didn't he only sign a one year extension? They couldn't get rid of him this year because Lakers wanted 2 first rounders for him lol
[2:38:00] Rottencoarse: @Sollice  they did not want to give those picks in retrospect they should have imo
[2:38:05] Triggered: Surely they'd still do that in the 3 days anyway?
[2:38:07] Rottencoarse: they do not have shooters at all
[2:38:09] Sollice: Or know sorry. People wanted two first rounders to trade FOR HIM
[2:38:18] Aquadriel: i mean they not wrong, people on beta already asking you to list your live rio in order to invite you lol
[2:38:27] Thoreya: which the lakers shouldve done, but jeanie and pelinka dont know what theyre doing
[2:38:31] Sollice: Like Pacers wanted Russ and 2 first rounders 27,29 for Buddy Heald and someone else and Lakers wouldn't give up those picks
[2:38:39] Nasilvera: how are shadowpriests in the patch so far?
[2:38:43] abracka_: found a awesome bug. sending enchants to alts, then trying to use the enchants causes the game to crash
[2:38:45] Rottencoarse: @Sollice  miles turner
[2:38:48] Ander1345: they really made this M+ for the season
[2:38:58] Sollice: Yeah thats who it was @Rottencoarse   Pelinka has to go
[2:39:03] Rottencoarse: @Sollice  they should have done it imo
[2:39:16] Rottencoarse: @Sollice  he got an extension :D
[2:39:25] Triggered: L E T S F L Y
[2:39:30] Rottencoarse: so i dunno how they are going to remove him
[2:39:39] spookychefkarolina: Saw a commercial for DF last night and I‚Äôm sorry, but the cat China commercials are better LUL LUL
[2:39:41] KaisenSiru: LETFLY
[2:39:42] srze94: :D :D
[2:39:49] futomara01: asmodan all over again
[2:39:52] Sollice: Of course they should have done it. Last year he was literally last in almost all Shooting Guard stat placements. And this year is starting off WORSE.  I don't know if he is trying to tank himself or like something happened but that dude is done
[2:39:55] Zivs: they have until season 2 to fix it np KEKW
[2:39:56] Se7enthSinn: Russell Wilson raid lol
[2:40:01] Ander1345: Nokhud Nation, Let's fly
[2:40:08] Zivs: or wait is it in s1
[2:40:18] Rottencoarse: @Sollice i mean they do not have the picks for next season lmao
[2:40:25] Rottencoarse: so why would they tank? :D
[2:40:41] Rottencoarse: that French kid victor is going somewhere else
[2:40:45] Sollice: No not Lakers tanking, I mean RW himself tanking for some weird reason
[2:41:06] Rottencoarse: who was RW? ?
[2:41:16] Sollice: Russel Westbrook
[2:41:21] Rottencoarse: ah
[2:41:27] Rottencoarse: that i do not know bro
[2:41:43] Rottencoarse: i watched all of the lakers games so far

[2:42:13] Thoreya: osu will roll. james franklin doesnt get top 10 wins
[2:42:26] Thoreya: hes like 0-9 or something against top 10 teams
[2:42:53] Sollice: Hope so. Their only regular season test is of course at the end against Michigan.

[4:36:02] ytsidilas: even the last is preped
[4:36:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: last one is sauced its just tradition to add a little more

[4:38:33] Bowyn_: @towelliee you can do it any way you want, as long as you take a bite of something with each sauce on it. you can wait like 30 seconds between each one or several minutes. then the last one you put extra of the last dab on it.
[4:38:34] halfblood74: thats the first one lol
[4:38:34] MrGattz: what do you want them to start off at 250 million?

[5:08:38] valianya: He's still stone cold
[5:08:38] Mecabeast: i like the vid of steve trying the different mixed drinks

[5:08:46] Twizted23faith: he did better than alot of the others I've seen
[5:08:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: He said his heart rate spiked
[5:08:47] GiveLoveLive: Is 32‚Äô monitor optimal for Wow? Or bigger?
[5:08:57] Dcarter: I‚Äôm down I need to come up with good questions
[5:09:02] Stronkk_EQ: 32" is great, that's what i use
[5:09:10] BlewGamingGroup: thatll get hit day 1
[5:09:13] mrz_as: AngelThump
[5:09:15] Hurtallpoptarts: The thing with it is not only compounding head but also the other ingredients causing your taste buds to fire up so it makes the more basic ones feel hotter
[5:09:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I use a 32" 144Hz monitor that is nice, but some gamers still prefer like a 27"
[5:10:08] Sollice: @GiveLoveLive Depends on resolution. 32 inch you should have a 1440p. I would advice against 1080o at 32
[5:10:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: The biggest issue is that when you go bigger, it's harder to see in detail all of the stuff on the screen because of a limit focus area
[5:10:35] Sollice: I have 3 32inch 165hz and its glorious
[5:10:55] Sigwoods: !drops

[5:10:57] GiveLoveLive: Ah okay thanks for the info guys!
[5:11:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Your eyes can only be focused on the middle of the screen, if you go to like a 42", you won't really be able to notice all the things going on in detail
[5:11:07] MR_WYTE: Still use 24inch 1080 @144Hz üò¨
[5:11:15] radakant: !drops

[5:11:44] Ballsonfire_: playing on my 75'' right now and i cant see shiiit
[5:11:58] GiveLoveLive: @ballsonfire__ hahaha
[5:12:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: With a 32" you have to move your head a little to be able to take in all the visual information, but for WoW it's not a big deal if the edges are kind of blurry
[5:12:48] Sollice: @Ballsonfire__ How close are you sitting? I play on my 65 inch oled every once in a while but I have a lapboard setup wireless everything from our couch and NW on it is chefskiss

[5:14:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: There's also a factor of "pixel density" and what resolution you like best does come into play
[5:15:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: When I was using a 42" 4K on my desk, it just wasn't real dense, this 32" in 1440p a little closer looks better to me
