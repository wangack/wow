[0:48:26] ProClicker: I wonder if Metzen is working on a classic plus. What are the chances it would make its own new timeline and an expansion not being TBC?
[0:48:51] Shirey12: Brewmaster seems to be the meta tank coming 10.2
[0:49:06] abracka_: vdh is the move, those changes are wild

[0:53:43] Nerdy1: Good morning Towelliee and chat! Happy Friday, I hope you all are well.
[0:54:16] ProClicker: Maybe Metzen can stop Thrall from becoming a pussy
[0:54:29] cipusanx: the main guy from cinematics twitted that he was working with metzen for longer than a year
[0:54:43] Mecabeast: Rip Michael Gambon  the actor who played Dumbledore second

[0:54:47] JoshuaTree6969: coffee and gaming
[0:55:05] Shirey12: I think the storyline is fine, But when I explain metzen's artstyle is the Venilla artstyle of wow. If you look up his artwork it was less PG and disney themed.
[0:55:10] Ealdfox: Chain smoking NE
[0:55:24] uyouu: Go Lions!
[0:56:33] abracka_: "less disney themed and PG" KEKW

[0:58:39] naamaristara: Wait Metzen working on classic now?

[0:58:55] abracka_: viable*
[0:59:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I wouldn't expect to see the Reforged label
[0:59:37] mavericks312: If they called it reforged retail players would get they popcorn ready
[0:59:59] mavericks312: True maybe that’s why it doesn’t hit as hard for me that he is back

[2:48:11] mavericks312: @DunzoCD we will give you ridder for fields

[2:48:56] CapitalFriction: Bears need all new coaching before they can find out if Fields any good or not
[2:48:57] mavericks312: bro FREE justin fields
[2:49:02] dapps231: what pause
[2:49:03] NickLeonhearth: that mage gonna drown
[2:49:09] dapps231: justin fields is 80% of the problem

[2:49:23] DunzoCD: yep, eberflus has like 0 personality too as a coach
[2:49:29] mavericks312: @dapps231 you dont know football then
[2:49:59] amaceika: Where is the rest of your group.
[2:50:01] mavericks312: imagine having a better version of jalen hurts and trying to turn him into a pure pocket passer
[2:50:24] CapitalFriction: Fields decision making has been slow, but everything else is coaching
[2:50:26] Savagee320: When is your next pack opening? The last one was actually fun to watch.
[2:50:32] racketpunch: A better jalen hurts?  Slow down there
[2:50:39] GreenBean59: he's flying lol
[2:50:42] Brodih_: getting the FP maybe
[2:50:45] GreenBean59: he doesn't move that fast unless on a flight
[2:50:49] DunzoCD: last year the dude ran for 1000+ yards and theyve run him like 4 times the first 3 weeks LUL
[2:51:00] mavericks312: @CapitalFriction ill agree with that to a point but when your line only gives you time for 1 read how can it improve
[2:51:03] dapps231: @mavericks312 bra watch the film and break it down, homie is pumping the ball rather than hitting the open guy... worst qbr in the nfl... worse than wilson!!!
[2:51:25] dapps231: my guy said "you dont know ball" LOL
[2:51:33] mavericks312: @racketpunch faster and throws a way better deep ball then hurts
[2:51:46] mewkittymon: Can you summon him ?
[2:52:00] mavericks312: @dapps231 you put fields on a team that knows how to use him and he is an mvp contender
[2:52:00] DunzoCD: @mewkittymon no warlocks
[2:52:50] dapps231: @mavericks312 CAP AS FUCK, you put hurts on the bears and they are a playoff contender.. you put fields anywhere and he still sucks massive peen

[2:53:18] mewkittymon: I was thinking there was a stone out side
[2:53:34] DunzoCD: @mavericks312 bruh bears arent a contender with hurts, they have more problems than the QB, not saying fields is better than hurts but theres bigger issues
[2:53:48] CapitalFriction: @dapps231 tell me you have never watched a Bears game without saying you havent watched a Bears game
[2:53:54] MoonwalkingAngel: sweaty no patient war is gonna get you all kild
[2:54:07] mavericks312: @dapps231 i hate to break it to you but if you take hurts off the eagles he is a back up level qb
[2:54:26] wildragehs44: what
[2:54:31] MoonwalkingAngel: oh thought you were tank
[2:54:41] dapps231: so everyone here truly believes that if fields is on ANY other team he is a mvp qb.. alot of dick smoking going on in here..
[2:55:10] mavericks312: @DunzoCD bears have a front office and coaching problem, O-line problem, lack of weapons problem fields is literally the least of there problems
[2:55:49] CapitalFriction: @dapps231 i never said that personally, but the coaching/playstyle of the staff is problem #1 with the Bears

[2:56:40] DunzoCD: @dapps231 bruh pretty clear you dont watch bears games
[2:57:21] Shamwise: Dang Wow token is at 339k
[2:57:25] dapps231: @DunzoCD you have said that 3 times now.. watched bears games since i was 9... the "you dont know ball" "you dont watch"
[2:57:33] falldrgn: well when you keep firing head coaches.. after drafting QB's
[2:57:39] dapps231: @dapps231 save it for someone that truly doesnt watch lol..
[2:57:56] mavericks312: @dapps231 okay cool since your anti fields give us fields for ridder then
[2:57:59] abracka_: shit it was at 350 even a day or two ago
[2:58:02] DunzoCD: @dapps231 then dont make ignorant comments

[2:58:33] falldrgn: @mavericks312 LOL as a falcons fan.. and a GA native.  I don't want fields back here.. hes a quitter
[2:58:46] racketpunch: You kinda have to just stop debating when someone says Fields is better than Hurts.

[2:58:57] mavericks312: @DunzoCD the problem with chicagos coach hirings are there trying to implement a certain scheme rather then coaching to his strengths
[2:59:02] wildragehs44: ok dapps now you  you being a clown.  cause coaching in football   is very important  so saying if madden coached the bears is bad  you clueless
[2:59:13] mavericks312: @falldrgn ill take fields over ridder 9 times outta 10 sorry
[2:59:15] dapps231: @racketpunch these people have some serious soul searching to do lol
[2:59:28] wildragehs44: even with fields there
[2:59:47] dapps231: we gotta talk about something the game play is slow and boring

[4:05:30] Odifma: The first day I took it I threw up 6 times in 1 day. I had a headache all day and I felt like I had a cold
[4:05:59] valianya: @towelliee is it different from your testosterone shots?  You taking both?
[4:06:20] Jango_: nothing beats diet and exercise
[4:06:42] Odifma: Its insane how it kills all your cravings and hunger. After the first 2 weeks on it I was like no wonder celebrities are taking this. It's a miracle weight loss helper
[4:06:46] Molvonos: Just like nothing beats depression like going out and touching grass, right?

[4:08:24] Spartapus: if you're obese or have other risk factors you could be dead in 10-20 years so it could be a trade off some people are willing to take
[4:08:46] zeitgeiz: My doctor really wants it readily available for everyone. It would reduce the number one killer, heart disease, and cancer is number two but several are related to obesity so it would reduce the number 2 killer
[4:08:58] Odifma: But I will say this, because of the shortages , I was off it for 2 months and man... the cravings for food came back after a few weeks. It was insane
[4:09:05] Jango_: @Spartapus for sure, and those who wish to take that chance i support fully.  Im just curious

[4:10:41] Zapp_Brannigan86: Can you still smoke weed on it?
[4:10:50] Jango_: my mother in law got gastric and it lasted for about 2 years
[4:10:54] Spartapus: and with gastric bypass, youre looking at the rest of your life, fighting malnourishment since you can't absorb
[4:11:24] Odifma: From what I've been told, the chemical that you produce when your full and gets sent to your brain, is being produced constantly because did the drug. So it curbs your appetite like crazy. You feel satisfied and full after a few bites
[4:11:28] Zapp_Brannigan86: i could scale back on drinking for sure, but wouldnt wanna quit smoking weed lol

[4:34:16] MoonwalkingAngel: there only is 1 boat
[4:34:30] napur_a: There is no way to trim armor in Runescape, but I had to identical armors, one with gold trim and one without and then I'd trade and keep the armor they gave me.
[4:34:39] napur_a: Two*
[4:34:51] Nuggnuts: @Towelliee its where ppl would "trade" you armour and you would "trim" it to give ita gold/white outline.. this is not possible to do. BUT you can obtain the armour from doing rewards caskets "clue scrolls"
[4:35:18] lorddrekken: Its kind of a shame shadowmeld can't be used in combat
[4:35:28] digaboom: @Towelliee  do you feel more relaxed playing vanilla wow stuff since it's mostly just adventure type-gaming or is it not that different?

[4:49:29] Rulem: the annual subscription for mounts definitely helps keep that sub number high
[4:50:09] Aquadriel: @Towelliee people saying d4 lost most players based on a activeplayer dot io. Yet on that same website d4 has more players than PoE KEKW
[4:50:10] breadwilton: @Rulem I didn't know people actually signed up for that

[4:51:22] NickLeonhearth: Rykher was playing D3 and had a stream title - Playing D3 because new season not because D4 bad" made me chuckle
[4:51:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ouch
[4:51:48] ashwing_: @dracullus How exactly can a single player game be dead?
[4:51:55] dracullus: releasing season 1 so fast before they made enough new content was stupid in the first place
[4:52:09] denflup: yeah, same as wow
[4:52:10] Aflictionn: i think the playerbase is atleast 60% less than before
[4:52:12] breadwilton: Twitch crowd is EVERYONE THAT HAS EVER GAMED EVER!!!
[4:52:20] Aquadriel: people using activeplayer dot io website to see "playerbase" @Towelliee
[4:52:22] ItsNobbie: Make Shako drop  at the same rate as they drop in Diablo2/Diablo2Resurrected - problem solved.
[4:52:30] AnimalCrackers_19: What is D4 views on other platforms?
[4:52:32] breadwilton: Lets just pull out random numbers from our ass
[4:52:41] breadwilton: I think its 54.572344% less
[4:52:44] ashwing_: People have never played a Diablo season in their life it seems KEKW
[4:52:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: 50% of the time i right all the time
[4:53:04] cipusanx: hard to believe that there are hundreds of thousands still playing with the game having the same content as the base ...not to mention millions
[4:53:23] dracullus: @ashwing_ but you don't play diablo like multiplayer game with rankings and such, you simply have specific goals in season and then you finish game
[4:53:47] breadwilton: Most of the people I played with in D4 didn't even know there was a Discord for it to find groups etc
[4:55:04] Aquadriel: Thank god d4 cosmetic shop is so bad so i dont feel need to buy anything

[4:56:53] breadwilton: overcharged for lilith carries on bone necro
[4:56:54] dracullus: I'm against cosmetic shop in diablo, cause unlike wow it isn't few shop cosmetic items + ocean of drops in game, you get all 'free' transmog pretty fast in single season and then all new transmog is only for $
[4:56:59] breadwilton: community paid him 30-50m a pop
[4:57:22] CapitalFriction: most people that are playing D4 are old dads that have never even been on twitch let alone care who's watching people play it
[4:57:28] freakyyytv: POE is over priced
[4:58:18] freakyyytv: they are awesome cosmetics though
[4:58:27] PotbellyGoat: @CapitalFriction ...I'm an old Dad
[4:58:27] PilusMedicus: Poe transmogs are amazing,  the price tough is absolutely rediculous,  there is a skin in there that costs 84 dollars, for ONE skin
[4:58:32] MrHI6HWAY: I miss the green sets in Diablo, didn't they say it's coming later or something?
[4:58:35] PotbellyGoat: go to bed
[4:59:38] CapitalFriction: @PotbellyGoat so am i. eveyone i know that game plays it causally and dont give a fuck if they ever hit max or get a shako or anything else.
[5:00:03] dracullus: yeah, sets would be good way to fill that gear gap between 80-100 level
[5:00:25] mavericks312: let s2 drop like s1 did an d4 is in trouble though
[5:00:30] NickLeonhearth: towHesaidit towHesaidit

[5:01:32] TheGiant99: D4 isn't going anywhere. There are a bunch of people who still play. Twitch numbers isn't a indication of if people are playing or not
[5:02:51] mavericks312: d4 was 0-100 then 100-0 real fast
[5:03:07] Alienfromger: 622 rigt now lol
[5:03:10] TheGiant99: The top streamers are not streaming it.
[5:03:48] CapitalFriction: right max stream numbers were like a mill with 13 mill actually sold.. twitch/reddit/gamer online viewers are minority
[5:04:03] TheGiant99: But losing people on twitch doesn't mean people are not playing the game

[5:05:04] Zapp_Brannigan86: last boss is 29 i think?
[5:05:13] TheGiant99: Even if this next season is perfect people will find stuff to complain about as thst is what gets clucks
[5:05:30] PilusMedicus: @cipusanx Like asmon said,  you dont get that '' wow i found something amazing '' in diablo, because you do that afterwards at the NPC playing item tetris
[5:06:03] Zapp_Brannigan86: Yeah Bazil Thredd is 29
[5:06:27] TheGiant99: People want their forever game instead of a right now game
[5:06:30] PilusMedicus: just sitting there for 6 min straight watching every yellow item if it has 0,1% more damage is absolutely trash
[5:07:24] Zapp_Brannigan86: Hes 29 and also fears so gotta be careful

[6:34:17] ocicatthedruid: Solo content like Tower of the Dead/Heaven on High from FF14. And do not tie it to player power outside of that content. What Torghast should have been
[6:34:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Make the housing stuff optional, have it look cool, and people will love it
[6:34:55] ocicatthedruid: Er, Palace of the Dead*
[6:35:03] Exodeo_: I'd love a return of the legion artifiact weapons
[6:35:18] zorantt: housing system but done right.  ship pvp combat system (even if the expansion isn't a pirate expansion), aerial combat system
[6:35:45] DunzoCD: towNut3 artifact power
[6:35:46] N3llee: plz no.. not looting a weapon the entire xpac felt terrible... and no thx to the endless grind.
[6:35:55] Xeressia: I don't envy those guys coming up with ideas
[6:36:06] byrdeen45: i just wish they would let you delete all those items there coloecting dust in my bank
[6:36:07] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[6:37:23] zorantt: Guild housing system. Doubt it would happen but let a guild build a city, decorate it, run an economy (probably won't because that will destroy any economy),
[6:37:28] DrkPhoenix6913: gimme account wide rep so i can play my alts without getting all OCD about it
[6:37:31] Wcvechten: customizable pirate ships obviously
[6:37:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's definitely hard to come up with ideas that 150 other MMO's haven't already come up with

[6:37:44] LifeJackett: to bring a large portion of the playerbase back they need to stop the seasonal model and the gear reset 4 times per expansion
[6:38:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Guild hall stuff would be great
[6:39:28] byrdeen45: it would bring back alot of players if done right
[6:39:59] denflup: Kappa
[6:40:23] zorantt: Towellie confirmed player housing is coming in 110.0 Kappa
[6:40:25] Moobot: THE new wireless Scimitar and Virtuoso Pro Open Back Headset now available! towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee
[6:40:32] luckfore: no lol
[6:40:34] BTiZZY_: it’s cooler than anything else they’ve released recently and i’m not even a player housing guy
[6:40:36] AnimalCrackers_19: new class how can they beat that
[6:40:37] LifeJackett: Novelty would wear off 1 to 2 patches in I think
[6:40:41] Day_Walker78: player housing no pls
[6:40:43] luckfore: play ff if you like that shiet
[6:40:44] Alienfromger: only wow2 could top that Kappa
[6:40:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I wouldn't expect player housing to be the headline feature
[6:40:48] Darkhrono: it could be similar to wod, where garrison was a main feature, and we still got everything else
[6:40:49] shadow2step: can we go and destroy other peoples houses?
[6:40:50] PotbellyGoat: Hobbit Hole housing confirmed
[6:41:05] manmower: if they add player housing they're gonna make us farm old raids for curtains and table drops
[6:41:12] Molvonos: God I hope so.
[6:41:25] Nerzalus: wow 2 is real Kappa
[6:41:31] Exodeo_: Also add craftable stuff for houses from profs
[6:41:45] manmower: every patch with indoor activities
[6:41:54] Wcvechten: I mean, ways to involve old content for cosmetics I think is good
[6:41:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bring back the MoP gardens!
[6:42:09] rokath1803: Wow sims
[6:42:09] manmower: 11.2 "we're adding basements and lawns"
[6:42:18] Korupcija_: mop garden was actually lit
[6:42:24] totoroblack1: trophy buffs what is this wayfinder XD
[6:42:26] Nerzalus: im not in that 1% but i think thats a cool idea
[6:42:27] totoroblack1: jkjk
[6:42:37] byrdeen45: get your epic lawnmower
[6:42:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was out there watering the plants and pulling weeds for quite awhile
[6:42:53] manmower: it'll probably be popular with collectors
[6:42:54] DunzoCD: MoP garden was WoW farmville
[6:43:13] XshadowturkeyX: yeah
[6:43:13] CDubTheRIPper: they add all that stuff but nothing is account wide danEvil
[6:43:20] manmower: all those new old world 'game assets' are for player housing drops, not an old world revamp
[6:43:20] Herzenliegen: easily
[6:43:22] zorantt: Let guilds build a city, decorate it
[6:43:22] Molvonos: Its only really bad in like, two places.
[6:43:46] DunzoCD: like Lost Ark
[6:43:52] Wcvechten: can't wait to make a brothel
[6:44:02] manmower: yea every single mount hangs out at your house
[6:44:03] CDubTheRIPper: id dig that
[6:44:05] stagturtle: I want housing with portals and ah, while being in a global trade chat. Just get rid of main cities
[6:44:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: alts you hate live in the basement
[6:44:12] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[6:44:28] byrdeen45: have all your pets running around your house
[6:44:31] dracullus: 50 chars in your house will haunt you that you don't play them
[6:44:31] CDubTheRIPper: what if you could make your alts your companions
[6:44:32] manmower: armor racks to show off the sets you earned
[6:44:53] manmower: put every boss head on the wall
[6:44:57] Darkhrono: @stagturtle thats the worst take on housing, its like playing a sigle player game
[6:45:02] MinivannGaming: I'd like to see a revamped Archeology profession - anyone can pick up like first aid used to be.  Then, make it so dungeons have alternate areas, bosses, etc. based on archeology, along with findable artifacts similar to the Zinh Rok, but other "lost items" from before Cata - Also will unlock original versions of dungeons that changed
[6:45:11] LuiBMHunter: Press your taunt button oh ermm :D
[6:45:21] SconsieJ75: getting rid of main cities and having alts as companions would be like turning WoW into BG3. no MMO aspect to that imo
[6:45:35] manmower: then they put housing items on the trading post
[6:45:44] valianya: I kind of want to see 2 types of housing.  A more involved and expensive land plot housing in various zones, and a cheaper type of ship housing - various ships and even airships as a mini housing system
[6:45:51] Broomba: Chat what did @towelliiee do after he did the deadmines, just got back from a massage
[6:45:54] byrdeen45: good i miss it
[6:46:03] zorantt: What systems can the coding work with?
[6:46:14] CDubTheRIPper: danHmm
[6:46:22] DunzoCD: theres a 2 on it LUL
[6:46:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoW 2 could have a different combat system, for one thing
[6:46:27] Darkhrono: mash up with starcraft universe for wow 2
[6:46:27] cipusanx: graphics, combat, story, world and so on
[6:46:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: worked out so well for Everquest 2 Kappa

[6:46:40] Broomba: that wow 2 fake hype train for years
[6:46:56] zorantt: Wow2 = Confirmation of a new heroic PVP system but months after pre ordering, they say they can't make it work Kappa
[6:46:59] ocicatthedruid: What could be different with WoW 2 is a brand new game engine that can have more than 40 people in a battle that doesn't lag out the whole game
[6:47:10] LuiBMHunter: there's no way Blizzard will split their playerbase by doing a wow 2
[6:47:20] CDubTheRIPper: if they do a new combat system then theyd have to keep 1 and 2 running
[6:47:26] Broomba: lol KEKW wow 2 a better graphic engine
[6:47:37] manmower: more realistic blood splatter
[6:47:47] ocicatthedruid: New game engine, that would change and that opens up tons of possibilities
[6:47:49] byrdeen45: combats fine
[6:47:52] strungoutlv: The combat is already the best out there. No other game is as fluid or responsive
[6:47:57] PokerFaceMoose: full mature game
[6:47:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Make it a hybrid tab targeting, more than likely
[6:48:10] manmower: make it FPS combat
[6:48:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Get rid of auto attacks
[6:48:21] Broomba: wow 2 new combat engine and style adopt from BG3 KEKW
[6:48:22] llNoTToXiCll: you got this Mr.bearto
[6:48:40] manmower: make wow 2 fully VR
[6:48:51] cipusanx: combat - something different to what we got. and as for graphics, i think wow would have more success with diablo 2 graphic style. not to mention a new engine that does not lag when 10 people are spamming abilities
[6:49:02] cipusanx: so much can be improved
[6:49:24] manmower: there is about a 50% chance they announce WoW 2 during Blizzcon
[6:49:26] Wcvechten: honestly changing the artstyle would be a bad choice with how distinct it is
[6:49:28] Xeressia: The respawns in here are really fast
[6:49:44] llNoTToXiCll: i dont
[6:49:45] llNoTToXiCll: sorry
[6:50:22] Haegemon: if WoW stops looking like a saturday morning cartoon, it stops being WoW
[6:50:28] byrdeen45: nothing wrong with the grafics
[6:50:42] manmower: Lineage 2
[6:50:48] ocicatthedruid: combat is fine, it's the outdated game engine that doesn't support it in large numbers

[6:51:25] Broomba: wtf?
[6:51:33] llNoTToXiCll: but you also cant just flip a games engines tho
[6:51:42] righteous07: I really like WoW combat. Feels strategic, fast paced, and responsive.
[6:51:46] Molvonos: The Art Style isn't going anywhere soon
[6:51:51] Th0rdoth: I like a good action combat mode, but wows target system is unique. And its very good.
[6:51:53] cipusanx: yep. as long as wow still makes money, we wont see wow 2 ever
[6:52:03] Haegemon: if WoW got a new/updated engine, it'd be their own internal tech, Blizzard isn't gonna tap UE5 or anything
[6:52:04] ocicatthedruid: large scale PvP or PvE events
[6:52:13] zorantt: Wow could be like D4 and open everyone's bag Kappa
[6:52:14] cipusanx: making wow 2 is a huge risk
[6:52:14] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[6:52:20] llNoTToXiCll: wow doesnt need a wow 2
[6:52:29] LearnedSomething: I want to see the same level of dedication and content release as they had for legion, in all areas outside the 3 endgame activities
[6:52:37] zorantt: Sorry. Load everyone's bag. Not open for D4
[6:52:38] tedol: wow 2 can be just the same game but multi-platforming
[6:52:38] Molvonos: Sony fucked up hard when they tried their Everquest 2 experiment.
[6:52:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: I believe in gameplay first, too
[6:52:51] Broomba: true
[6:53:13] LearnedSomething: including class fantasy, challenge solo content, brawlers, evolving zone storylines, professions, etc.
[6:53:21] medanmarko: Why should WoW aim to be like the others? Its unique, with all its differences, and thats why it stands out. Other MMOs all blur together, by aiming to uniform mechanics and not make their own. Thats what WoW does differently. It has its mechanics and it stud by them for 20 years.
[6:53:28] Th0rdoth: I think the only "right" way to blizz try a "WoW 2" is making something like POE 2, you know, a sequence connected (really) with WoW 1
[6:53:32] Nerzalus: i just want the wow we know and love but on unreal engine so i can loot even shinier
[6:53:39] Totemkatsu: cata
[6:53:40] Broomba: its like taking pac-man and try to evolve it or improve it but in the end its pac-man
[6:53:40] tedol: wow has something like that
[6:53:44] LearnedSomething: we had that for suramar
[6:53:48] Nerzalus: items
[6:53:57] tedol: basically cata
[6:53:58] manmower: Suramar-style for every zone

[6:54:05] LearnedSomething: no just content released at a steady pace that's all
[6:54:06] ocicatthedruid: basically phasing as you complete stories
[6:54:12] Molvonos: @Th0rdoth The only problem with that, like OW2, anything that's sequential for a multiplayer online game is seen as nothing but a shitty cashgrab.
[6:54:18] Broomba: evolving story lines, sounds like a choose your own adventure
[6:54:32] Syllvn: Syllvn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 86 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[6:54:37] Zolshy89: they have that
[6:54:39] Zolshy89: it is called phasing
[6:54:40] justagamingfiend: so firelands?
[6:54:41] Zolshy89: Lol
[6:54:55] manmower: they already have the time stuff
[6:54:56] tedol: I think, it will be against MMO like concept
[6:55:01] zorantt: Twilight Highlands had that
[6:55:04] Haegemon: phasing works in linear sequence, but not diverging outcomes
[6:55:14] luckfore: they just need to give us Legion 2.0 and we gucci
[6:55:17] manmower: games were doing that 10+ years ago
[6:55:27] Snabido: Say if you got mugged in this alley, but you kill the npc, and now the npc is visibly dead for all time CoolCat
[6:55:29] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[6:55:35] Mecabeast: so like the old wrath gate questline in wotlk?
[6:55:37] manmower: didn't GW2 do that?
[6:55:51] byrdeen45: wonder if there going to do anything with undercity?
[6:56:01] Wcvechten: foreshadowing at its best lmfao
[6:56:03] SSD511_: oh
[6:56:03] Bixster: @luckfore Players in Legion werent happy with Legion
[6:56:04] zorantt: I believe Twilight Highlands had that as the main quests, or at least part of it
[6:56:06] Nokterian: LUL
[6:56:10] manmower: we've got chromie time, i thought their phasing tech was way better now
[6:56:17] Alienfromger: he knows
[6:56:17] Nokterian: Cata classic oh my
[6:56:27] LearnedSomething: cataclysm classic is an oxymoron
[6:56:27] Thewunk: I really hope we dont get Cata Classic
[6:56:32] luckfore: @Bixster alot were ;)
[6:56:51] manmower: player housing would be an additional reward track to drive the blizzard store
[6:56:54] raldrik: more interactive harvesting like new world does would be cool
[6:56:58] zorantt: Would love some sort of naval pvp system
[6:57:22] quentinkil: hi how are you king @Towelliee
[6:57:24] manmower: what happened to all the airship battles we thought we would get after wotlk?
[6:57:38] tedol: Wow in outer space, that will be funny
[6:57:45] Necrothia: i think that is the quest yeah
[6:57:49] xmedpakx: be able to travel the seas would be cool honestly
[6:57:57] flyingmachin3: getthe apples yet?
[6:58:00] eldritchcoffee: orcs in spaaaaaaace
[6:58:23] Haegemon: did new world change their harvesting mechanics? they were never anything more than "push button, get biscuit" like WoW harvesting is
[6:58:29] PokerFaceMoose: you DAFT FOOL
[6:58:35] Rosstt: Whats the addon that voices the quest text?
[6:58:40] Nokterian: That gnome man KICK HIM
[6:58:42] Rudric_Ice: if they release housing oh my get a Chair for your house for only $9.99 from the store hurry limited time only
[6:58:43] Snabido: Hidin' in the bushes
[6:58:44] manmower: archaeology, player housing, ships, revamped large scale pvp
[6:58:48] flyingmachin3: im almost done in ulda but you might finish first
[6:58:51] LearnedSomething: I pity the fool
[7:00:10] vurax1: are you going to play Cata if it comes out or no
[7:00:14] Trawkey: oculus was the air battle
[7:00:15] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[7:00:15] MinivannGaming: Mounted Combat would be nice
[7:00:31] LifeJackett: A big one would be shared reputations, shared seasonal progress across all characters - except gear
[7:01:00] Shrenko: shared reputation is a must in next expansion 😡
[7:01:12] Haegemon: what would "large scale PvP" even be that doesn't just devolve into "our blob vs their blob", especially when there's no collision between player characters
[7:01:35] LifeJackett: The one thing that eventually killed wow for me (played from Vanilla through to Dragon flight 10.1) was the seasonal model and gear reset per patch. Im just completely burnt out now
[7:01:42] DunzoCD: Ashran was horrible and still sucks to get as your epic bg LUL
[7:01:50] Snabido: Closest thing you will get is reputation percent as catchup, but not shared
[7:02:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they don't want reputations shared because one dude on the forums said he likes regrinding it on all his alts LUL
[7:03:30] Aidler: I still wear my 395 head and legs item. it's better than everything I could get on 437
[7:03:42] delaine: it would look like 8 frames a second
[7:04:05] Purgatan: Gw2 had some awesome large scale pvp back in the day. Not sure if that is even a thing anymore.

[7:04:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: The exp boost from war mode did get some people to turn it on
[7:04:14] Rudric_Ice: wish we got the dota azshara bg map which was datamined years ago
[7:04:28] Snabido: Sympathy chance Kappa
[7:04:30] Purgatan: I don’t like pvp out when I’m questing, just want to vibe and do my thing
[7:04:33] Broomba: @towelliee after you ran Deadmines what did you do before stockades?
[7:04:41] Korupcija_: it's always 10% now since a lot of people went alliance
[7:04:52] manmower: BFA world pvp was scratching at starting to be interesting
[7:04:56] Haegemon: GW2 PvP was just blobs slamming into each other, felt like it was a shadow of what PvP in GW1 was
[7:05:37] Chris_Cringle: hamhock and bazil thredd slap pretty hard
[7:05:38] manmower: the could link BG end of match results into a Horde v Alliance tug of war experience
[7:05:44] PhillyDilly18: Seal of Wyrnn
[7:05:46] Purgatan: Never played GW1 pvp…in 2, loved scouting and or defending stuff
[7:05:49] PhillyDilly18: Wrynn?
[7:05:52] Rudric_Ice: bfa had the best wpvp i dont know why they removed the random crate drops from the world
[7:06:00] xmedpakx: ya super nice ring
[7:06:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Solo queue rated battle grounds is definitely something for the PvP people
[7:06:32] XshadowturkeyX: yes it will ive always wanted queable rbgs
[7:06:35] Shrenko: yep Im hyped for that
[7:06:37] Purgatan: I’m excited for the solo queue for rated bgs
[7:06:37] Dinomight3: I feel like high tier rated BG will be unbareable?
[7:06:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: They are excited to see it
[7:06:47] Snabido: Few threads later of "this class is too good in solo rbg, nerf pls" Kappa
[7:06:52] flyingmachin3: on last boss
[7:06:52] Shrenko: but normal BG's would be kind of dead, no?
[7:06:57] manmower: need a pvp renown track
[7:07:23] Shrenko: or I guess peoplel will use normal BG's for practise
[7:07:34] Wcvechten: it does  lmao

[7:09:48] UtherBrexton: also wasn't batting against 15 pitchers throwing 100 mph fast balls
[7:09:54] MinivannGaming: A lot slower pitching back then too

[8:24:03] Brenndon: yup
[8:24:03] Sylphy_TV: The Submarine Pirate Expansion POGGERS
[8:24:07] Broomba: Kungen is working and leveling through WOW 12.0

[8:24:17] Korupcija_: he was on the team since november
[8:24:17] Sicknessqt: Terrans been working with Chris which is kinda interesting
[8:24:35] Brenndon: I mean, i just want him to go on stage and yell "for the horde". i don't care about anything else :P
[8:24:43] Korupcija_: and all the retail devs tweeted they love working with him
[8:25:26] Brenndon: Nah i mean, for 11.0 that he might have influence on that story line as well.
[8:25:27] Chubfishh: Why would he do Classic? Classic is finished stuff.  They NEED him to make story and gameplay better. Thats my take

[8:26:41] darkjedi1787: lol
[8:26:47] Snabido: Emerald Dream coming to Classic, this patch will be the crossover? PogChamp
[8:26:58] Broomba: WOW Classic Progressive
[8:27:02] decoytph: What is Classic+? Not sure I understand what that would be.
[8:27:06] Brenndon: Can you imagine, if they changed the ending of wotlk just for funs and giggles and it changes the whole outcome haha.
[8:27:11] CloudPants8081: is the leak awakening real? Kappa
[8:27:14] LearnedSomething: come on man

[8:27:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: GOT 'EM
[8:27:36] LearnedSomething: I don't buy that for a second
[8:27:40] Broomba: too many people in chat spending too much time speculating on something no one has knows
[8:27:42] luckfore: story would have been made long before he joined
[8:27:44] Chubfishh: I think Chris helped polish it up

[8:29:30] SavageCheez: Meyzen is the Godfather of the Warcraft uNIVERSE
[8:29:35] darkjedi1787: I want more dragon abuse

[8:32:24] DunzoCD: everything was the jailers fault Kappa
[8:32:30] Arbszy: i can't wait for the rage posts about Blizzard hyping them up and not giving what they want KEKW
[8:32:51] Snabido: Diablo Immortal style

[8:34:35] Brenndon: People were just hyped because of dragonriding.
[8:34:36] Snabido: Have this channel ranked wow trailer cinematics, or we past that
[8:34:36] darkjedi1787: the last best xpac was WoD idk the lore was interesting
[8:34:38] aladinsane444: Wod cinematic was the best
[8:34:46] HaloS23: i miss the actual CG cinematics! But Terran and team KILL IT!!!
[8:34:54] Sicknessqt: BFA and WoD had insane hype cinematics
[8:35:15] Purgatan: Df cinematic was least exciting…good quality, but not really exciting. Bfas was epic

[8:35:49] CloudPants8081: towKek
[8:35:57] valianya: DF intro cinematic gave Koranos more characterization than Jailer had all of Shadowlands
[8:35:57] DunzoCD: draenor had an amazing cinematic
[8:36:00] manmower: Lords of War cinematics pre-WoD were good

[8:37:23] Purgatan: Draenor questing was so good. I liked Garrisons, but I play solo a lot
[8:37:41] DunzoCD: WoD's storytelling kinda went off the rails a bit
[8:38:07] manmower: zones were good
[8:38:10] Endofdreams: Wod sucked because blizz gave up on it in the first 6 months
[8:38:17] Endofdreams: and there was no content
[8:38:17] Sicknessqt: Raids and garrison gold KEKW
[8:38:24] darkjedi1787: I liked it i guess i'm different lol

[8:39:42] Sicknessqt: MoP will be the first classic i play
[8:39:44] Snabido: 2 more years then we got it Keepo
[8:40:02] hugotanks: The second raid of mop was grest and firelands off of cata. I didn’t like cata but heroic firelands was a good raid
[8:40:19] manmower: basically for an expansion to be good they need to highlight orcs a lot
[8:40:24] SSD511_: idk every classic don't feel hype the way it's come out before
[8:40:40] dudeimunknown: You ever played with yumy before?
[8:40:44] occtriple: Think about how great the first tier of Cata raids was though, 3 raids in one tier like hello when did they last do that?
[8:40:54] manmower: WoD also updated all those character models
[8:40:56] Chubfishh: The Void stuff can possibly become 2 expansions
[8:41:13] Keyastaron_: whats up @Towelliee  hows raid
