[0:33:25] obbi87: @Darksider2008 I guess he is back. Also just a side note. people would not care about the lawsuite if the products was good :P Only reason so many "none blizzard staff" is mad, is because most of their products are so bad and everything at blizzard are so delayed. Lets say this happened during TBC, Warth back in the day, no one would care. In the end of the day, people just want a good product
[0:34:29] Darksider2008: agree i played through the newest expansion and burned out pretty quick

[0:55:51] Zugspect: i dont think OTK will be doing any more wow stuff
[0:55:55] Zugspect: since their arena team fell apart
[0:56:09] redfernn: ah
[0:56:42] obbi87: @Zugspect REally hjope its not OTK, dont get me wrong love asmon, but all what the org do is boring imo
[0:56:54] Zugspect: OTK kinda swung towards a LSF/irl shit
[0:56:59] Zugspect: instead of actual gaming
[0:57:23] TheZander: If OTK cant hold cdew and co how the fuck are they going to pay a roster of at least 30 people?
[0:57:41] MrKhanes: yeah OTK is mor of a show/irl content org now @Zugspect
[0:58:14] Zugspect: we will just have to wait and see, they could have scored something huge and will announce it before 9.2 releases
[0:58:27] banNickk: courage is a big fan of yours
[0:58:28] Zugspect: the OG optic days was my fav time to watch cod

[0:58:59] redfernn: I dont play wow any more, but it seems like shadowlands has been such a small expansion. albeit 9.2 could last like 10 months like nzoth path for BFA
[0:59:04] Zugspect: they were also some of the first big gaming content creators

[1:10:17] redfernn: it's better... but only 1.3k viewers on twitch
[1:10:35] Zugspect: well the thing about battlefield is its never beena big streaming game
[1:10:44] Zugspect: its a game for middle ages dads to bang out on
[1:10:45] Masqerader: I would rather play 5 honestly.
[1:11:03] Zugspect: likr 90% of battlefields player base is dads on consoles

[1:11:36] Nokterian: it never had a competitive scene with bf
[1:11:51] Masqerader: they tried to have competitive in bf3/4 but there netcode/hit detection just made it impossible
[1:11:57] DailyDisclosure: well there used to be amateur leagues
[1:12:05] DailyDisclosure: BF4 had tourneys
[1:12:13] Zugspect: same thing with recent cods LMFAO
[1:12:22] Zugspect: vanguard came out and like 2 weeks later they put it on sale on b net
[1:12:27] Nokterian: I stopped buying BF with BF4 that was a shit show.
[1:12:41] Talason: 2042 is already 34$ on green man gaming
[1:12:41] redfernn: there is no new content coming to the game until March apparently.
[1:12:43] Masqerader: 2042 suffers from shitty maps with no cover and 128 player being farmed by choppers
[1:12:56] Talason: i agree mas
[1:13:02] Talason: did they ever nerf the hoovercraft shit
[1:13:09] Zugspect: imo apex legends has been pretty good since its release
[1:13:13] redfernn: the 64 player mode has improved massively imo
[1:13:16] WizenLogarithm: Halo did good tho
[1:13:18] Nokterian: Halo Infinite MP came out winning tbh
[1:13:19] DallTV_: vangaurd was not a great game
[1:13:25] Warjun11: yeah the new maps are crap
[1:13:30] Nokterian: such a solid MP
[1:13:54] Zugspect: BUT the halo campaign is sick tho
[1:13:59] Zugspect: its a brand new style
[1:14:13] Touchpadwarrior: WHADDUP T-DAWG
[1:14:16] Masqerader: To be fair, vanguard/battlefield being on sale for the price it is, isn't uncommon, all past battlefield/cod games usually go on sale at this time. battlefield 4 was like 30 dollars on pc/ps4  a few months after it released
[1:14:25] Nokterian: free on game pass
[1:14:27] DallTV_: gamepass :)
[1:14:45] Zugspect: gamepass si like 10 bucks a month i think
[1:14:48] WizenLogarithm: 1 buck
[1:14:51] Zugspect: for like 200 games or something
[1:14:52] WizenLogarithm: for now
[1:15:13] Nokterian: you dont have to buy games
[1:15:22] Nokterian: it is all included in the game pass
[1:15:46] Talason: halo is $60
[1:16:04] Nokterian: you get 200+ games on there and it's 12 euro's a month but i have game pass for 3 years LUL
[1:16:05] Zugspect: xbox game pass is nuts for its cost
[1:16:09] WizenLogarithm: Is torghast the same boring stuff like in the beginning of the exp?
[1:16:20] Zugspect: 1000% worth the money
[1:16:38] DallTV_: gamepass is the best one of them out there
[1:16:47] Masqerader: @WizenLogarithm and 1 less floor
[1:16:50] TwitchTourist_: @WizenLogarithm it is still boring as hell.
[1:17:00] Nokterian: gamepass gives you all the newest games on release
[1:17:04] Zugspect: this version is alot better than release torghast

[2:18:53] CrixPTSDgaming: Just drop it after the new year we have been beta testing for a year now already
[2:18:59] Masqerader: Everyone thinking OTK is rolling in money lol
[2:19:10] Zugspect: OTK is rolling in money but they are not a gaming org
[2:19:17] Zugspect: they are basically offline tv
[2:19:23] Zugspect: but a different group
[2:19:42] Romeexx: I hope Dying Light 2 will be amazing. The first one was awesome.
[2:20:16] liviu_81: they delayed coz need to change starting cosumes; show too much skin KEKW
[2:20:20] CrixPTSDgaming: Whats the other big MMO coming out Riot? or is that far off?
[2:20:22] Fakenezz: According to the Lost Ark director, thjey wanted to localize the latest tier before the release of the game
[2:20:37] qbabattoir: lol
[2:20:39] Zugspect: yea @CrixPTSDgaming thats gonna be a ways off
[2:20:42] Zugspect: but i have HOPE
[2:20:46] Kaykerrs: Riots game has years to go still
[2:20:48] Zugspect: HOPEIUM
[2:20:52] dalaraz: didnt we cover all tities on wow cause of china ?
[2:21:07] Zugspect: i have faith in riot tho
[2:21:19] Zugspect: with how good valorent is as a game, i think they can pull off an mmo
[2:21:20] luckfore: why does blizz think boob is bad? lol
[2:21:24] Fullmetalpwn: when Riot does launch tho, it will hit hard
[2:21:52] dalaraz: lets talk AoC :3
[2:21:52] Zugspect: and the massive ammount of lore they could build off of from a game like league, their little metaverse shit they have between games
[2:21:57] Zugspect: a riot mmo would be insane
[2:22:16] qbabattoir: tru
[2:22:16] MrPiingo: !oondasta

[2:22:19] Korupcija_: I took vaccine just to live long enough to see riot's mmo
[2:22:27] CrixPTSDgaming: New wow expansion?  Dragon Expansion @Towelliee
[2:22:31] SpikerzX: A riot MMO will be the same as New World, just total trash
[2:22:32] dalaraz: moba communities are worse than mmo
[2:22:36] Kaykerrs: Did you watch the League of legends series on Netflix towel?
[2:22:45] Zettabyte: @Towelliee A good game or Riot Kappa SoSnowy

[2:23:05] luckfore: riot mmo is wow 2? :O
[2:23:11] Freestar25: might die faster that way LUL
[2:23:16] zenFX_: @dalaraz moba communities are the worst period.
[2:23:22] QuigsTV: @towelliee how’s it going today?
[2:23:41] Zugspect: and great raids/dungeons etc
[2:23:48] Zugspect: its going to have to really hit, but i believe
[2:23:49] KillaPr0: KillaPr0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 21 month streak!

[2:25:23] originaladdict: yeah
[2:25:46] echterman: what about a mmorpg in the horizon zero dawn universe? i think it would be great.
[2:25:48] Zugspect: wildstar was literally what i was thinking
[2:25:57] Valvax: i miss wildstars tbh
[2:26:05] raiwist: they just missed the furry epoch i think
[2:26:07] raiwist: LUL
[2:26:07] Rev_4_Life: tbh the telegraphing in that game killed it for me. felt like i wasnt fighting bosses
[2:26:13] CrixPTSDgaming: How do you rate endwalker?
[2:26:21] originaladdict: I think they still going to go for cartoonish look to be honest, i am sceptic even if the game will be good. Like Genshin, similarly
[2:26:22] qbabattoir: same
[2:26:26] QuigsTV: @towelliee if you’re using that toy so much why don’t you put it as a favorite so it will always be the first page
[2:26:46] Masqerader: Wildstar was another game that couldn't get out of its own way and kaboom
[2:26:55] liviu_81: @originaladdict  what game ?
[2:27:00] spyrit14: Do you think AGS is pushing dungeon mutations too soon?
[2:27:13] neorang3r: genshin is a lovely waifu collector game
[2:27:24] originaladdict: @liviu_81 Genshin Impact
[2:27:30] Ratthard: how many attempts did u have on Sha, galleon? and so far on nalak and oondasta.

[2:27:38] CrixPTSDgaming: Genshin and Breathe of the wild need to be the art styles of the future.
[2:27:48] SpikerzX: @CrixPTSDgaming no
[2:28:04] qbabattoir: i think they have enough money to make a good game
[2:28:08] valianya: Wasn't there a thing about China demanding Tencent let them put in spyware and control if they wanted to keep operating there?  Or was that another huge gaming company?
[2:28:10] qbabattoir: hopefully
[2:28:11] CrixPTSDgaming: what would you suggest @SpikerzTV
[2:28:29] spyrit14: The changes to the trade skills in NW are amazing they made trade skills addictive
[2:28:30] Masqerader: i can probably send fox back to town and comeback with wm
[2:28:31] Kaykerrs: @crixptsdgaming new Breath of the Wild 2 soon I hope lol
[2:28:45] raiwist: are you mount farming?
[2:28:48] CrixPTSDgaming: @kaykerrs for sure bro
[2:29:00] spyrit14: rare crafting mods are dropping from the chests
[2:29:14] AgentWhiskeyy: Towellie you are The Godfather of WoW
[2:29:14] raiwist: gl
[2:29:15] CrixPTSDgaming: Riot is making the new WoW movie
[2:29:17] xAkeRoN: I think any new MMO can be a good game only if they don't make the mistake to be the Wow killer. FF14 devs always say Wow inspired them etc but their game is significantly different from Wow. This is what killed wildstar imo
[2:29:33] Moobot: @Basilwheat 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[2:29:39] SpikerzX: @CrixPTSDgaming If all the future MMO's would look like that, it'll be horrible. MMO's need to come up with their own design and looks. If people like it, yaay, if not, who cares
[2:29:39] I_Baja_I: p. sure creators have like a 5% stake in riot or something
[2:29:42] Dalsonson: Riot is 100% Tencent, 100% Epic, 42% Activision Blizzard
[2:29:43] Zugspect: What about ashes of creation, you have any faith in that?
[2:29:47] Ratthard: Can u show mount tab and your collection? 🙂
[2:29:51] Dalsonson: Err, Tencent is 100% Riot
[2:30:14] Roccocco: hey towelliee. how many tries did it take u on ur pala to do mage tower?
[2:30:22] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[2:30:25] liviu_81: raiding hard af  kiled it ?
[2:30:28] CrixPTSDgaming: @SpikerzTV I agree but they were innovative that's what I am saying.
[2:31:11] byebyeshy: I think it's the brand name because the FF devs cannot deal with bots for their lives
[2:31:12] CrixPTSDgaming: I keep thinking you get a legendary everytime the Rare announcer pops up
[2:31:15] spyrit14: Final fantasy 11 is still sub and it's 20 years old
[2:31:16] Zugspect: @Towelliee you have any faith in ashes of creation, or is it still too far out, or do you even have any interest in it
[2:31:16] SpikerzX: @CrixPTSDgaming agree, but if all games were made like that, its gonna be boring because they will all be the same
[2:31:23] restokin: I just want WoW 10 to be good :( I don't know what they can do to breathe life into the game again
[2:31:46] Tobysina: I really want a WH40K MMORPG
[2:32:00] mmo_kenna_: ESO is in a good place atm, great MMO
[2:32:13] CrixPTSDgaming: WoW just needs to value players time more
[2:32:14] spyrit14: I don't trust the producer of ashes is an archeage whale
[2:32:19] SpikerzX: @restokin get rid of bobby, and dont be stupid online with replying to stuff.

[2:32:44] griffdog125: Like fallout 74
[2:32:54] BlueBabo: !oondasta
[2:32:55] conv3rge_: I mean the CEO was also involved in a literal pyramid scheme/MLM Scam (Xango)
[2:33:12] mmo_kenna_: ESO isn't a great streaming game but a great immersive experience
[2:33:26] Freestar25: not a scam...

[2:33:38] HenricoM: What is your hope, for WoW? :) @Towelliee
[2:33:48] conv3rge_: Okay I guess not technically a scam, but depends on people's stance on MLMs
[2:33:55] Zugspect: the only problem i have with mmos is that just nothing feels as fluid to play as wow does
[2:34:07] Zugspect: its always had the best combat to me and ive tried pretty much every mmo
[2:34:09] iOrion_: @Towelliee Colts are playing good right now, JT MVP
[2:34:17] xAkeRoN: @Zugspect This
[2:34:21] CrixPTSDgaming: What new class for WoW do you hope for @Towelliee
[2:34:24] Freestar25: "stance" lmao if there are goods/services sold, by definition it isnt a scam
[2:34:36] luckfore: @Zugspect yep true
[2:34:39] originaladdict: @Zugspect You don't like BDO combat style?
[2:34:39] CrixPTSDgaming: it's a quarterback league
[2:34:46] ispyyro: The talks of a new Marvel mmo for console and PC sounds good
[2:34:51] CrixPTSDgaming: Aaron rodgers will win it
[2:35:00] iOrion_: Facts. But im born and raised and Indiana, pushing for JT
[2:35:03] Zugspect: nah BDO feels like FFXIV to me and i have no interest in either
[2:35:16] Thoreya: same ^
[2:35:27] raiwist: wow 2 would be awesome
[2:35:30] Zugspect: i would love a revamp
[2:35:33] raiwist: start from scratch
[2:35:42] luckfore: havent heard from Ion in a while
[2:35:44] Zugspect: start from scratch BUT KEEP ALL YOUR OLD SHIT
[2:35:48] Zugspect: mounts/toys/ etc etc
[2:35:49] Raaeni: they'd lose too many ppl to a reset
[2:35:55] originaladdict: GTA haven't gotten a new game, don't even start hoping for wow 2 bros :)
[2:35:56] Alegnowar: i feel like the wow team is not ambitious enough to revamp azeroth
[2:36:01] arcanedream69: BDO looks awesome and the combat system is nice until u start pvping
[2:36:03] geokouts: WoW 2 that starts from 2004 WoW and alllll again P
[2:36:18] Korupcija_: let's just delete everything people collected over the years :)
[2:36:21] Valzark: season of mastery retail WoW
[2:36:37] Zugspect: it could basically just be a soft restart of wow
[2:36:38] conv3rge_: @Freestar25 Go to wikipedia, literally on the entry for pyramid schemes it addresses why they viewed by people as scams lmao.
[2:36:39] Neizrc: @arcanedream69 what do you mean bdo pvp is good
[2:36:43] raiwist: oh hell yeah
[2:36:44] CrixPTSDgaming: Steelers need a new QB if you guys can get Russel Wilson or Even Jameis Winston you will be so much better next year Najee Derrick Henry 2.0
[2:36:44] Zugspect: new players should start on the new continent aswell
[2:36:53] EmpathyLiveChat: I'd love that
[2:36:54] Freestar25: dude wikipedia isnt a good source lol
[2:36:55] Zugspect: the old game is way too conveluted with too much shit going on
[2:37:02] raiwist: i would lose a few months of my life
[2:37:03] palastiel: Dragon Isles xpac maybe?
[2:37:08] WelshMango: They need that
[2:37:12] Deroes73: noninstanced

[2:37:14] Korupcija_: I wanna crit for 200!
[2:37:21] spyrit14: maybe a black empire xpac?
[2:37:27] Fakenezz: World of Starcraft, change my mind
[2:37:28] arcanedream69: @Neizrc i never said pvp is good i said combat system looks nice until u start pvping and realize its not
[2:37:38] liviu_81: monkaW
[2:37:39] WelshMango: @fakenezz yasss
[2:37:41] CrixPTSDgaming: What do you think about Cordelle Patterson not making the probowl?
[2:37:41] Zugspect: wasent BFA basically a black empire x pack?
[2:37:43] Zugspect: or am i tripping
[2:37:45] originaladdict: @Fakenezz i would try that ngl
[2:37:46] TwitchTourist_: yeah make the hp, mana, hit, crit numbers small again!
[2:37:46] qbabattoir: xqcT
[2:37:47] WelshMango: With space tauren
[2:38:02] Royal_Sen: and no dungeon maps or raids tactics explained pre release
[2:38:07] Masqerader: We lose and Sargeras/Illidan and the Pantheon appear, Velen shows up in the Vindcaar and Khadgar is in karazhan wondering why there is a picture of a bowl of fruit
[2:38:10] Neizrc: @arcanedream69 no i mean pvp is good... dunno why u think otherwise, too fast?
[2:38:13] Beet4: A normal expansion in 10.0 would be so anticlimatic
[2:38:18] shakinground: @CrixPTSDgaming  ben did announce this was his last year
[2:38:19] palastiel: Turalyon goes loco
[2:38:21] Alegnowar: i mean they're waiting to announce next expansion after we get the ending in 9.2, they must be hiding something "different" behind
[2:38:22] jerseyfive: i want to go home
[2:38:24] spyrit14: the lore of wow has been less than impressive lately
[2:38:27] conv3rge_: @Freestar25 From the FTC website: Pyramid schemes are scams.
[2:38:28] arcanedream69: @Neizrc animation glitches
[2:38:28] raiwist: they have a lot to work with yeah
[2:38:31] NerdyTeK: bring back legion SwiftRage
[2:38:35] originaladdict: @Fakenezz Starcraft MMO , daymn
[2:38:38] dalaraz: metaverse multiverse are the new words i seem to start hating
[2:38:41] Rev_4_Life: naruu vs void lords where we have to stop them both
[2:38:44] Zugspect: Legion was the best x pack tho @NerdyTeK 👀
[2:38:51] CrixPTSDgaming: @shakinground he is looking like peyton manning before he retired
[2:38:51] Freestar25: pyramid schemes are when money trades hands but goods/services dont
[2:39:02] Neizrc: @arcanedream69 nope, that's like .1% of the fights. animation glitches happen when u iframe a grab for example
[2:39:04] CrixPTSDgaming: Steelers have too much talent to not be better than what they are
[2:39:04] NerdyTeK: @Zugspect thats wut im saying
[2:39:25] Zugspect: Legion, then MoP for me best x pack wise
[2:39:25] Moobot: Get the Prime Gaming Bundle in Genshin Impact now - https://gaming.amazon.com/loot/genshinimpact?ref%20=SM_GI_TWL_CB

[2:39:26] shakinground: @CrixPTSDgaming really sad for all those steelers fans
[2:39:28] arcanedream69: @Neizrc i know how it works i've been playing bdo since release in 2016 =D
[2:39:29] valianya: Won't 10 be the first time Danuser has actual full creative control ?
[2:39:35] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Well not totally true, we didnt know we are going to Kul Tiras and Zandalaar after we killed Argus LOL
[2:39:45] spyrit14: Xal;atath said there was a thin veil in the priest order hall to the void

[2:39:59] Rudric_Ice: Kappa
[2:39:59] conv3rge_: @Freestar25 I just quoted your source bro.
[2:40:16] Hakazo: @Towelliee Do you think they will revisit the bobby kotick thingy?
[2:40:25] Freestar25: You are not understanding your own previous statement
[2:40:27] Neizrc: @arcanedream69 ye same, im spending 90% of the time in the battle arena and pvping and i still think pvp is good
[2:40:31] Zugspect: idk it just feels like we are literal super heros nowadays in wow and im not playing a super hero game
[2:40:32] CrixPTSDgaming: I drafted Russel Wilson this year a broken finger made him pretty bad
[2:40:37] Zugspect: i just want the scaling to be taken down a peg
[2:40:46] Masqerader: ya the void lords should finally appear and stop giving world souls syphilis
[2:40:53] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Thats what i mean, so who knows what might happen, maybe we get teleported to Dragon Isles when we kill the Jailer, or we go to totally different planet as you say
[2:40:55] Rudric_Ice: danuser is the lead story guy in SL too
[2:41:07] arcanedream69: @Neizrc i still like bdo i've just grown tired of enchanting and breaking and repairing items

[2:41:45] silvabaq: cardinals white hopkins isnt a contender anymore. thats why colts gonna blast them
[2:41:46] Masqerader: Think the Bucs signed Bell today
[2:42:13] palastiel: If Steve is there
[2:42:14] geokouts: Got it! before Jailer is defeated at end 9.2 he is saved by N'Zoth and then brings him to Azeroth, corrupting it. Now next Expantion we decide to be Normal races or Corrupted ones!!
[2:42:17] othraerir: his first rodeo :)
[2:42:26] kimmo_gaming: They are always going 2 expansions forward when doing development, i mean yeah changes can happen, but lore stays the same
[2:42:34] Bogzeh: the guy who said theyve been setting this up since warcraft3?
[2:42:47] Alegnowar: they have to release an expansion next year, that's what corporate ask
[2:43:03] valianya: Imagine if another old god corrupted planet is full black empire and they send another full old god out into space as a void spore invasion that crash lands on Azeroth for a better Old God/Black Empire expansion?
[2:43:22] PvtHudson093: He knowa
[2:43:29] Kurincion: HeyGuys
[2:43:30] kimmo_gaming: Now, when all the things happened, yeah, but they will get back on track next year i guess, maybe
[2:43:31] Zugspect: yea theya re already 100% aware of the hit they are going to take with subs with how long 9.2 will be around
[2:43:34] raiwist: issues ate blizzard? Kappa
[2:43:37] raiwist: at
[2:43:40] Zugspect: so im almost 100% sure whatever is next will be good
[2:43:43] BananaCatchUp: what version are we on?
[2:43:49] BananaCatchUp: 9.1 right now?
[2:43:50] othraerir: their own catchup mechanics, i like it
[2:43:51] luckfore: 9.2 is almost done so i guess all their work is on 10.0 now
[2:43:52] arcanedream69: isn't there any hints in the books what the next Expac might be?
[2:44:05] Zugspect: oh fuck yea i forgot about that
[2:44:08] raiwist: oh that is gonna be awesome
[2:44:08] Rudric_Ice: SL is WoD 2.0
[2:44:13] CrixPTSDgaming: I mean legion was great and Draenor didn't have a 6.3
[2:44:16] Zugspect: woahhhhh relax
[2:44:22] Zugspect: wod was by far the worst x pack ever made
[2:44:37] Zugspect: i wouldnt compare SL to WoD
[2:44:51] Thoreya: play till ulduar
[2:44:52] Alegnowar: different in what sense? more qol?
[2:44:54] Thoreya: then bounce
[2:45:01] Zettabyte: #NoChanges!!! Kappa
[2:45:02] CrixPTSDgaming: WoD was terrible
[2:45:04] StewartJ1994: WOD BFA  worst xpan
[2:45:10] nezzorztv: WRATH IS THE BEST ID SAY
[2:45:12] ispyyro: What didn't you like about WOTLK?
[2:45:16] silvabaq: is it possible for blizz to put out a 4th raid to get more time for next addon? or is that not possible for lore reasons. assuming that a raid tier is easier done than a new world @Towelliee
[2:45:18] Leafylockx: @Zugspect WoD raids were far superior to SL ones so far
[2:45:25] Alegnowar: that sound exiting
[2:45:29] Masqerader: Towelliee will play till end of ulduar
[2:45:29] CrixPTSDgaming: Essenses and Corruptions saved BFA
[2:45:33] Exusprime: Question, would Blizzard have gained any favour if they said we arent doing 9.3 because of internal issues (TLDR) rather than they were never planning on doing a 9.3?
[2:45:40] Zugspect: BfA wasent really good until season 4

[2:48:39] liviu_81: legion was awesome
[2:48:45] CrixPTSDgaming: it is keeping wow competitive with FF14
[2:48:50] Beet4: They need to drop the classics and focus on making retail perfect instead
[2:48:52] Ajintroz: legion was my favorite
[2:48:52] dinobille: nighthold best raid ever
[2:48:54] Masqerader: only like 3 good thing about WOD.  Raids, Mythic Dungeons/challenge mode and Gold Farming Mission tables until they ruined it
[2:48:55] CrixPTSDgaming: literally 5 year old content
[2:48:55] palastiel: Not like all these classic servers are taking away from retail development Kapp
[2:48:56] dalaraz: legion with little bit changes to avoid the frustration,would be perfect @Towelliee
[2:49:08] miser_o: do you think if they know how useless staff conduit energy are?
[2:49:12] Tharia: nighthold is my favorite
[2:49:15] zenFX_: @yllibbilly definitely top 2 for me
[2:49:17] Zugspect: most of the x packs dont feel great until a few patches in
[2:49:18] miser_o: *like
[2:49:24] CrixPTSDgaming: Well the legendaries plaqued it
[2:49:27] Bogzeh: legion best expac for me, had such high hopes for future expacs
[2:49:31] Masqerader: 100s of sad saps that are slept deprived on attempt 6000
[2:49:34] MosesBun: eh too much bad will for me probably last xpac for me tbh unless somehow next xpac will be crazy with bfa into shadowlands having more fun with ff14 tbh
[2:49:35] Zugspect: for some reason they always fumble launch but end up getting their shit together toward the end of the x pack
[2:49:36] dalaraz: legion was terrible on start cause of lego acuizision,if they fix that for a potential classic,it will be epic
[2:49:45] luckfore: @Bogzeh yep and then bfa/sl happend :D
[2:49:49] Tharia: thing I didn't like in legion was the restriction on weapon
[2:49:52] Tharia: but then I got over it lol
[2:49:54] TwitchTourist_: I just wanna start over and get the cool paladin transmogs, nothing else :D
[2:50:00] Raaeni: legion was terrible for me until 7.3

[2:50:30] Masqerader: Remember the start of Legion, if u got the worst legendaries you were essentially fucked.
[2:50:33] Vapo: i got hardcapped on legos with 4 of the 5 worst legos until they made them drop more KEKW
[2:50:35] TwitchTourist_: @Towelliee show your transmogs for pala please :)
[2:50:39] valianya: The whole idea of the story stretching back to the start finally wrapping up might be in reference to their old expansion roadmap, which only went up through the climax with the Burning Legion, which links to the Sylvanas storyline and the SL storyline because of Legion having a hand in creating the Lich King but it was dreadlords and Jailer manipulation behind scenes
[2:50:47] liviu_81: i was getting warrior   leggos in lfr  like you won t believe it KEKW   while  my pally ... Sadge
[2:50:50] CipansR_Ayaya: KEKW

[2:51:05] spyrit14: Yoshi-P coined the phrase themepark, something for everyone philosphy, and still continues to make the game that way
[2:51:17] Secondbreakfasttt: what i 'v learned  so far there is no rough start,  this is their strategy and  then serve  like not a fix
[2:51:17] Zugspect: my first leggo on my warrior in legion was aggrimars stride peepoSad
[2:51:20] Zugspect: it was brutal
[2:51:24] valianya: So they hit the end of those storylines

[3:32:09] futomara01: less systems more dungeons
[3:32:19] Zettabyte: less grinds Kappa
[3:32:19] nursenils: Mythic+ Deadmines
[3:32:26] geokouts: more Free stuff :P
[3:32:36] Vapo: less layers of borrowed power that fades the moment next expac hits
[3:32:39] Kromede: more fruit bowls
[3:32:48] originaladdict: no subscription :P
[3:32:52] Zettabyte: pepeMeltdown
[3:32:59] Kromede: pepeMeltdown
[3:33:19] SpoofAvatar: are you doing a stream at 9 PM pst for twitch drops, or normal time tomorrow AM?
[3:33:20] ralecgos: I agree about old content. I've always disliked that old content is made totally irreverent when a new expac comes out
[3:33:22] stryderr88: !oondasta
[3:33:22] Moobot: @stryderr88 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[3:33:37] HazyThunder: Flight from day one of an expansion.
[3:33:41] SpoofAvatar: nice
[3:33:41] Raaeni: the cypher of the first ones seems fun, too bad ppl are saying its a waste of dev time because no player power
[3:33:43] FutileDiploma: Have you checked out last epoch yet ?
[3:33:50] af2kk: bring back denathrius
[3:33:51] KingsandClubs: I,m from Serbia and let me tell you Doncic and joking will surpass European legends
[3:33:56] Codeoffry: what you got in that vape?
[3:33:57] rockthefries: same as last time? need like 10 hrs for all drops?
[3:34:04] nursenils: I like what they did to leveling in Shadowlands, that you can do all dungeons from 15-50 or whatever level it was.
[3:34:14] Inthezonewow: damned if you do, damned if you don't
[3:35:03] Korupcija_: make it fast to farm and it's fine
[3:35:07] Mallas2: just make the game so you dont have to fix every single big system over 2 years.
[3:35:07] bigjuicystan: but tbf most classes feel so empty with no borrowed  power
[3:35:09] lithium364: the cypher is supposed to be an 6 month grind if you want it maxed right
[3:35:18] Dalsonson: But what’s wrong with a zone without player progression when the entire expansion has been PP??”
[3:35:22] geokouts: put auto-quest and auto-play :P nah
[3:35:40] futomara01: is it so much to ask for new content to also be fun and give player power
[3:35:44] rockthefries: still have yet to get that vinyl for mecha done D:
[3:35:46] originaladdict: WoW has many aspects, people want to personalize those aspects, to be honest that was the og comment's question.
[3:35:48] Zettabyte: @Towelliee Bring the player, not the class Kappa
[3:35:50] Masqerader: coolio gangsta paradise parody for WOW  one of the lyrics "Player in the Power, Power in the Player, system after system hour after hour
[3:36:09] Contendedlemon: still waiting for my tinkerer class PepeHands
[3:36:17] Korupcija_: nah game is literally unplayable without soul shape
[3:36:24] Greybeard_ttv: they need to just keep it simple
[3:36:28] PvtHudson093: Make better trinkets
[3:36:33] Mallas2: the issue is they spent what last 6-7 years with borrowed power than removing that might be too big of a thing for them to do
[3:36:37] stagturtle: !oondasta
[3:36:37] Moobot: @stagturtle 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[3:36:53] af2kk: just dont repeat that cataloged research sys
[3:36:58] donutcrooks: rip new world. i just joined wow now and took 2 hrs to get lvl 8. am i doing something wrong lol
[3:37:01] Mallas2: i mean for the community
[3:37:06] Mallas2: they can do whatever they want
[3:37:12] Inthezonewow: Ressurect the artifact weapons FeelsBadMan
[3:37:26] zarod89: not everyone wants a stripped down wow tho, like classic
[3:37:26] FourFootTree: facts
[3:37:33] originaladdict: truth!
[3:37:37] dalaraz: thats waht makes game boring
[3:37:42] FourFootTree: based
[3:37:42] lithium364: or WoW Nfts
[3:37:43] gravess_66: but the tip says to take friends outside azeroth lol
[3:37:52] Inthezonewow: Sylvanas and Jaina skins for Fortnite coming soon
[3:37:56] Dalsonson: Warlords of Draenor did it, replicate the magic of WoD. Players enjoyed the xpac (albeit lack of content, what was there was good) and what borrowed power was there?
[3:37:58] luckfore: its sad to see, shadowlands started so well and now its a shiteshow
[3:38:08] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I mean they can make all the content relevant by gear scaling so the gear from every single dungeon in the game is current but the latest m+ and raids are more powerful, or something like that
[3:38:21] FourFootTree: WoW just needs to refine its game and stop adding shit
[3:38:25] mmo_kenna_: Don't make the content too hard tho ffs, chilled runs through old content
[3:38:37] Arcon_LP: We just need to take the big sword out of Azeroth‘s a**. Should be plenty of power in player‘s hands.
[3:38:39] Vapo: borrowed power should enhance classes, not fill the gaps left in designing them
[3:38:41] af2kk: you think using old areas and systems is good or bad @Towelliee ?
[3:38:44] runitbacklivie: Do you think could ever come back on top?
[3:38:47] dalaraz: why we scrapped garisson and class halls really ? they were a decent base to move on with
[3:38:59] Mallas2: like they did after BFA Jebaited
[3:39:16] nursenils: So many zones and dungeons deserted. Make them relevant
[3:39:23] Mavrick33: Mavrick33 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[3:39:23] runitbacklivie: *wow could come back on top
[3:39:33] FourFootTree: I feel like WIldstar would do great in today's market - to bad it shut down
[3:39:48] fistofnature: but thats gonna cost us an entire expansion LUL
[3:39:48] Moobot: Get the Prime Gaming Bundle in Genshin Impact now - https://gaming.amazon.com/loot/genshinimpact?ref%20=SM_GI_TWL_CB
[3:40:11] Rev_4_Life: cross faction raiding is long overdue at this point
[3:40:25] Mallas2: if you did token gear for like LFR or normal (but for limited amount of pieces or some kinda reforge system) and then tons of cosmetic items for old content ala FF14 might be good
[3:40:36] af2kk: exactly connect the whole thing together .... u get more time to put into quality rather than making new maps ... use the older ones but do quality stuff using the time the would design a new map
[3:40:41] Masqerader: raiding/mythic + feel like mythic + needs to be in cross faction grouping
[3:40:43] ralecgos: they kinda did it whenever they added those companion pets to the old raids, but that was for sololing of course. I'd love if they made the old raids like a real raid again for sure
[3:40:45] dalaraz: just 1-2 raids per expansion,and they we will be fine
[3:41:16] Raaeni: didnt ppl shit on blizzard for being lazy because of the nzoth assaults in old zones?
[3:41:23] mario32: how come i lag on some streamers but not here. can it be due to the streamer settings
[3:41:57] af2kk: its fine quality stuff takes time were not gonna get everything at once but man there are some nice zones that could be used beautifully with nice neat systems
[3:42:01] fistofnature: please no

[3:42:12] futomara01: battlepas + sub?
[3:42:16] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Do you think they can make the old gear scale to current and old dungeons scale as well so all of the content in the game is relevant?
[3:42:29] lithium364: Kappa
[3:42:33] runitbacklivie: Black desert has a battle pass
[3:42:36] mozavich: sorry, haven't watched in awhile. what's battle pass?
[3:42:36] CrusaderNero: if its stupid, Blizzard does it Kappa
[3:42:43] dalaraz: like timewalking seasons witha pass ?
[3:42:45] Javi2Great: Only cosmetic tho right?
[3:42:46] Dalsonson: So, here’s a serious question Towelliee: What did MoP and WoD have that Legion/BfA/SLands didn’t?
[3:42:48] KingsandClubs: @crusadernero LUL
[3:42:53] mmo_kenna_: WoW classic should've went down seasonal battlepass SoM is half arsed
[3:43:00] Clicklesly: But they are kinda doing that with timewalking ^^
[3:43:11] dracullus: regular patches are key, people get bored, find every weak spot in expac and start complaining/quiting
[3:43:16] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Not current as such, but LFR ilvl for example or something like that
[3:43:22] Elff11: @Dalsonson Easy, challenge modes!
[3:43:24] ralecgos: You know what I want? As a mage main I really want them to put in an option where you can cut the dress off cloth chest pieces so it's a tunic *cries in transmog*
[3:43:37] KingsandClubs: @towelliee Santa towlz can i get an infinite Timereaver for christmas? 😂
[3:43:41] Mallas2: i am just glad ff14 has raid fights as 1 boss thats it and once you get your tokens for the week you are done and you don't have to farm a million things to stay up to date
[3:43:48] Catcoaster: !OONDASTA
[3:43:48] Moobot: @Catcoaster 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[3:43:51] af2kk: for example mop zones are really nice they could spread expansion content around old zones and be nostalgic as well as better than new zones because i think the started to run out of ideas ... design wise
[3:43:55] CaptReddBeard: you still in death jesters?
[3:44:06] Naturalbeef: Happy Holidays @Towelliee and chat!
[3:44:16] CaptReddBeard: lmao been a while brotha
[3:44:28] CrusaderNero: pls not spacelazers
[3:44:32] futomara01: its time for the void
[3:44:36] KingsandClubs: I don’t want another planet azeroth needs to be explored more
[3:44:43] ralecgos: new dark portal????? call it the light portal lol
[3:44:48] Raaeni: azeroth is boring at this point
[3:44:51] dracullus: people would hate reveal with new planet, most want return to Azeroth
[3:44:52] af2kk: but would they nail it thooo???? i mean you can make one new map but also use older ones
[3:44:54] payasoplimplim1: next exp remembers me to the khadgar's comic
[3:45:13] Yurian33: gotcha
[3:45:16] Yurian33: haha
[3:45:16] dashzombie: off white portal
[3:45:34] Rev_4_Life: Azertoth is kinda forgotten about at this point.
[3:45:34] Korupcija_: if you give people content every few months nobody would care about anything
[3:45:39] Maneguster: There is nothing stopping us from expanding on Draenor with Yerells light cult
[3:45:41] ralecgos: we need to explore the BACKSIDE of azeroth before we leave the planet lol. we need to milk azeroth for all she can give
[3:45:59] dracer30: because wow players are old and super nostilgic
[3:46:02] KingsandClubs: I would like it to go to another planet if at the end we don’t kill jailer and shit goes south yeah but now just get me home and let us see the other side of azeroth
[3:46:02] dalaraz: crossroads lets gooo
[3:46:07] TheHardcorian: I want a magni expansion farming aserite all day every day KEKW punish us all
[3:46:07] dracer30: they dont like change
[3:46:09] ElPolloBatman: there's still the potential for 2-3 "undiscovered" continents Kappa
[3:46:10] zarod89: I think they want old fashioned D&D content
[3:46:10] arcanedream69: people want the nostalgic feel when they were young and had carefree time at their disposal
[3:46:11] KurumTV: Lots of speculation next expansion will be something like the Dragon Isles, the dragon mount pack came out now and if all went according to schedule, next expac would've already been revealed
[3:46:15] Naturalbeef: I feel like it would be awesome if they incorporated all of the old content into current gameplay. Imagine having 130 M+ dungeons to run
[3:46:15] nursenils: If you want Barrens and Elwynn you play classic
[3:46:21] Sockfrog: I guess it's more the idea of having something a bit more down to earth that reality ending afterlife shenanigans run by 7-head nippleman :P
[3:46:24] af2kk: i dont want to go back to the azeroth we know today i want a new azeroth ... changed where it got a little destroyed or something new ... but use the actual map
[3:46:27] SpoofAvatar: she got a big ass we can explore :P
[3:46:37] fistofnature: hahah
[3:46:47] runitbacklivie: Whats max lvl in wow now
[3:46:49] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Yeah but make new planet with Tirisfal Mountains, Eastfall and Elwyn deserts Kappa
[3:46:56] Dimitrios90: true LUL
[3:46:56] ralecgos: We were in azeroth in the entire BfA expansion pretty much
[3:47:04] dashzombie: but classic da best Keepo
[3:47:07] flebbooo: KEKW too many murlocs and kobols killed through these years
[3:47:10] Rudric_Ice: towStop towIt
[3:47:12] ElPolloBatman: what about bizarro azeroth?
[3:47:18] Dalsonson: So if we did go to another planet, start from level 1, we run into a massive issue. 2 different levels. ACTUAL levels, not Level + Artifact Lvl/Neck Lvl/Renown Lvl
[3:47:31] ElPolloBatman: where horde is good and alliance fel humans from draenor
[3:47:34] futomara01: i hope the jailer wins so all this retconning has not been for nothing
[3:47:38] goofywizard: Yall like WoW turning Sci-fi?  I mean with the light and void. That’s on different planets
[3:47:45] Mallas2: i am still salty they didn't make those nzoth invasions  all over the planet. You bring in Lovecraftian stuff and you do that? bleh
[3:47:55] af2kk: i loved the void effected azeroth in bf it looked new .... cool ... thats what im saying not just use the map .... change it a little and give it to people
[3:47:57] goofywizard: It’s already sci fi but that ain’t it
[3:48:03] ralecgos: I have a strange feeling they're going to kill all the main characters except maybe a couple one of these expansions and just start a whole new story
[3:48:06] Prince_Puppa: Wow isnt fun any longer… ppl are hanging on to their memories
[3:48:07] KingsandClubs: @futomara01 jailer dies soooo yeah not prob gonna happen
[3:48:09] mihailo1306: oh on
[3:48:11] mihailo1306: no
[3:48:19] zarod89: optional light and dark factions lol

[3:48:48] gooni_coyg: do we finnally get a new class in the next expansion?
[3:48:55] medanmarko: Well if they make the whole Light VS Dark the same as Ally VS Horde then... its just a reskin... SO that exactly what they will do :D
[3:48:58] dalaraz: we need less class ,not more
[3:49:03] KingsandClubs: New expesion new class?
[3:49:05] luckfore: john hight
[3:49:07] sherry_bi: Do u think the game now is playable for the new players ?
[3:49:10] flebbooo: Wasn't it John Hight?
[3:49:18] Prince_Puppa: Ofc its my opinion… i know some still like it esp if u make a few hundred grand a yr from playing it
[3:49:24] Yurian33: John Hight moved up
[3:49:30] flebbooo: yeah we don't need more of that classic influense
[3:49:31] af2kk: rather than making a new class give a new spec to each class ... that would be cool
[3:49:32] flebbooo: LUL
[3:49:35] Prince_Puppa: :)
[3:49:38] Bladerdiblaat: The alpha and omega
[3:49:47] Yurian33: hes the boss of what this new person will be
[3:49:50] ElPolloBatman: it's time to bring peter molyneux to wow development!
[3:50:05] dalaraz: we dont need more specs or classes,we have so many dead already and balance issues,20 spots on raid etc
[3:50:12] luckfore: check his linkedin
[3:50:13] Inthezonewow: He oversees the warcraft/wow franchise
[3:50:15] luckfore: General Manager, Warcraft Franchise
[3:50:19] yokai_5: @af2kk like if blizzard existing most specs are good or fun ... LUL
[3:50:28] zenFX_: @Gooners well since wrath theres been a new class every two expansions so I'm guessing there will be
[3:50:35] KingsandClubs: I petition to put gordom ramsey as CEO LUL Game would be fixed in a couple of months
[3:50:39] Naturalbeef: #1 thing I want in 10.0 is a new talent tree. Get rid of the "set in stone" specs we have now.
[3:50:48] Raaeni: wouldnt 10.0 still be affected by that classic mindset though?
[3:50:50] gooni_coyg: Shadowlands broke that theory @zenFX_
[3:50:56] Korupcija_: meanwhile Ion quit wow KEKW
[3:51:16] af2kk: @yokai_5 ORrrr re-design some of those dead ass spec classes has .... like the whole thing from scratch
[3:51:17] ElPolloBatman: and he also gets paid more for streaming wow than the other ceo, who left the company. oh, wait!
[3:51:31] KurumTV: Feels like a LOT of talents are unusable rn, if they just rework the talents themselves, classes would feel alot more fleshed out
[3:51:47] flebbooo: yeah and that worked so well for them LUL
[3:51:54] CrusaderNero: thats good
[3:51:55] CrusaderNero: keep him
[3:52:07] Mallas2: less titanforging is fine. less gear.. yeaaaa
[3:52:10] yokai_5: @af2kk i wish blizzard listens to the class changes from the players , it feels like they never play their game classes or specs
[3:52:10] zardistus: good morning towelliee and hammer squad
[3:52:13] KingsandClubs: Rework talent system maybe input a 4th row and give classes one more spec game fixed
[3:52:15] luckfore: felt so good to get no loot in castle nathria
[3:52:17] CrusaderNero: take away? They have done that since BC
[3:52:20] 1law_chroniclaw357: wow about to die out
[3:52:22] af2kk: the game feels so linear ... the idea of it .... other than farming mogs and mounts
[3:52:28] GombiG1: what made us quit was lack of loot and lack of rewards from m+ and activities
[3:52:37] yokai_5: and shitter systems
[3:52:40] kimmo_gaming: I mean just make warforging scale to a certain ilvl and thats it
[3:52:43] maalow: warforging wasn' that bad... titanforging is
[3:52:48] CrusaderNero: they listen, they just dont act on it
[3:52:56] youngpandalul: what about recrute a friend system now
[3:52:58] Yurian33: you are optimistic giving it a month
[3:53:10] af2kk: wow2 incoming
[3:53:18] EFFSIN: I actually think this 9.1. 5 catch up is fun for pvp I hope they keep it going

[3:53:36] Frostfury: KEKW
[3:53:36] KingsandClubs: @towelliee SHOE ON HEAD NOW LUL
[3:53:37] CrusaderNero: tiddiecontent
[3:53:46] TheHardcorian: my biggest gripe with wow is the sheer amount of systems and currencies added each patch that mean nothing in years to come, only relevant at the time
[3:53:47] MedryWoW: man wasnt sure i heard that right
[3:53:55] EFFSIN: They’ll force u to show ur tittys supposedly
[3:53:59] EFFSIN: Or fry u
[3:54:04] yokai_5: im pretty sure , they do how economy growth meetings are , so they do a table round with the most income out of the faster way from the people without giving a shit about the players
[3:54:05] Calphurnious: A great christmas gift from Blizzard would be to be able to download and play the original wc3
[3:54:43] gooni_coyg: tbh dont think wow players know what they really wants
[3:54:44] flebbooo: Wc3 Refunded
[3:54:46] CrusaderNero: that reforge is so fucking bad it hurts

[3:55:04] HazyThunder: I think a community council is a great idea, but maybe not for a game as gigantic and system heavy as WoW.
[3:55:10] Calphurnious: krippKEK I refuse to taint my pc with that install lol
[3:55:14] MackAttack1421: I think WoW needs to add some more fun stuff to do, but it needs to have variety to keep different interests addressed.
[3:55:17] Drakossbane: you're missing out
[3:55:23] Thunderbrew: Why is reforged 3 bad?
[3:55:23] flebbooo: And now no one ever mentions reforging for wow cause of it LUL
[3:55:30] MackAttack1421: like housing, transmog, pvp, raiding, battle pets, mounts
[3:55:32] yokai_5: IMO the best blizzard game that got better over the years because the dev team wasn't under pressure is heroes of the storm in it is current stage .
[3:55:36] KurumTV: There's a good video about it from the OG WC3 map designer who also made Culling of Stratholme map, he explains alot about what happened and how almost everyone got sacced

[4:00:59] WhiteTiger91: so true
[4:01:01] af2kk: they still milking ow
[4:01:03] CrusaderNero: problem with OW early on was that meta was 3 heals & 3 tanks
[4:01:08] MrGattz: idk why blizzard does a lot of things tbh. at least to me half the stuff they do with their games seems ass backwards from a monetarily standpoint.

[4:01:35] MedryWoW: Even with starcraft, Korea did it independantly with broodwar and when blizzard stepped in they damaged the korean scene and it took years to recover

[4:04:53] flebbooo: aaww
[4:05:13] Masqerader: Bobby needs to go back to acting in Money Ball 2 the A's move to Las Vegas
[4:05:20] af2kk: yo i feel like activision is the big bug here .... look at the big games that makes tons of money the go the wrong way and lose fans after a few years .... its like activision milks those games and then leaves ... good example is destiny 2
[4:05:24] yokai_5: no one cares about her now anyway she got in the story way too much
[4:05:32] shale93: lol next dog will be zovaal
[4:05:39] KingsandClubs: Why didn’t phase out varian like that man.. fuck sylvanas
[4:05:45] valianya: I think its less blizzard devs driving the bad/greedy money decisions and more the shareholders and Activision telling them what to do and making demands without guidance on how.
[4:05:52] Yurian33: Shes going off to join Khadgar for a few years
[4:05:59] thorined: tyrion PepeHands
[4:06:04] MrGattz: f
[4:06:08] Contendedlemon: he got so phased out he didnt even go to the shadowlands

[4:06:29] payasoplimplim1: @KingsandClubs to soon bro
[4:06:29] Masqerader: Varian got disenchanted by Gul'dan and put on the AH
[4:06:43] NewWorldReign: Her lore is pretty decent to read.
[4:06:48] Dalsonson: You think she ever goes back to leading the Forsaken @towelliee ?
[4:06:49] valianya: Dadgar don't want her in his tower
[4:06:50] KingsandClubs: Didn’t someone make a video that there is a crow in oribos representing khadgar overseeing everything that is happening
[4:06:53] dracullus: it was surprising how little nostalgia fuel was used in SL
[4:06:57] yokai_5: Zul'jin story and reghar story is much better imo
[4:06:59] Calphurnious: Everyone save your snowballs for sylvanas
[4:07:17] Tito429: How many 60’s do you have
[4:07:30] dalaraz: ive seen that vid yeah
[4:07:35] dranet11: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA0dZR0lak4
[4:07:36] NewWorldReign: Although she got more tongues waggling than her sisters until Blizzard thought "Lets give Sylvanas a quote were it asks the player if she is their favorite Windrunner"
[4:07:36] thorined: LUL
[4:07:38] Zivs: Think it was a Bellular video, the crow is outskirt of oribos
[4:07:39] pilhass10: 42 50's monkaW
[4:07:41] af2kk: imagine an orc but its a nightfae orc dude come on couldnt they make it like a woods barbarian style for orcs or from melees in general ?

[4:08:16] dranet11: I just linked the video
[4:08:20] Sockfrog: Her story is like a trilogy that decided to add far too many more books after their success, and now it's just getting tedious.
[4:08:22] yokai_5: medivh has the most and best story im wow imo , sadly it get ignored after karazhan

[4:11:14] TheHardcorian: sneaky Blizzard KEKW
[4:11:15] jason_tacey: Magni's spirit animal?
[4:11:21] Sarocus: No reason for Khadgar to be incognito, though
[4:11:24] ElPolloBatman: kadghar got transmogged, he's catgar now
[4:11:27] KingsandClubs: IT’S ANNN ILLUSION!
[4:11:31] CrusaderNero: that crow will generate 100+ speculate YT videos
[4:11:33] TheHardcorian: would you quit if Magni came back? @towelliee
[4:11:35] Raggamoffyn: maybe its there to HEAL THE WOUNDS
[4:11:36] Sarocus: Or does he owe the cartels money?
[4:11:44] NewWorldReign: What does Dadgar have to do with Shadowlands anyway?
[4:11:45] HazyThunder: that transmog on your DK is amazing!

[4:12:22] af2kk: yaaaa its like the fire has been lit for story andys
[4:12:26] CrusaderNero: the only mage they nerfed was khadgar
[4:12:27] zarod89: he was a man, they needed a woman
[4:12:27] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Yeah but where is Magni? LOL
[4:12:30] Melonbrew: He's a shit wizard :)
[4:12:36] stankould: XD
[4:12:36] XarkoLP: i hope kaghgar comes back one time
[4:12:37] pinkphoenix90: They seem to have an issue with characters reoccurring too much =(
[4:12:38] Yurian33: Khadgar was problematic as a powerful white male.... he needed to be replaced
[4:12:39] flebbooo: Just felt weird, he was previlent in the story. My guese they just thought people got fed up with him after wod/legion
[4:12:43] TheHardcorian: but Jaina is horseshit LUL she's useless
[4:12:47] Naturalbeef: He's learning about the Dragon Isles
[4:12:48] temp3st98: LUL
[4:12:49] ralecgos: I feel like his story was so tied into the Burning Legion and they kind of left him in Legion because of that
[4:12:49] KingsandClubs: Yet in warcraft movie khadgar shoots lighting LUL
[4:12:50] thorined: CHAMPION!
[4:12:52] dranet11: magni got taken out by the azerite beam
[4:12:55] prongs__: I don't play wow for a couple of months what's going on with the game right now?

[4:12:56] PvtHudson093: The Woons
[4:12:59] flebbooo: BUT CHAMPYEN
[4:12:59] arlog111: magni overdosed on azerite dust
[4:13:04] yokai_5: valeera / reghar and shen got ignored totally in the last 3 expansions and they are main characters in the lore
[4:13:05] XarkoLP: but we need to heal the woons towe!
[4:13:07] Kisswani: POGGERS
[4:13:08] Dalsonson: Is it just me or is that Sylvanas/Uther 9.2 Cinematic the best they’ve put out, hands down?
[4:13:08] CrusaderNero: LUL
[4:13:11] Thunderbrew: I like how FF14 keeps most characters relevant and in the story.
[4:13:14] dalaraz: what if khadgar is training with medan and wrathion in dragon isles @Towelliee
[4:13:16] chukudu: Dragon Lord Kungen Kappa
[4:13:18] jason_tacey: He knows!
[4:13:19] HDrx: actually 100% true
[4:13:20] Masqerader: Khadgar/Velen "We need to save Azeroth at all cost" when legion appears... old gods appear *crickets*
[4:13:29] Raggamoffyn: magni enters shadowlands in 9.2 and wants to "heal its wounds"
[4:13:46] dranet11: kungen had a guild in castle nathria dont you remember?
[4:13:50] NewWorldReign: what 9.2 Sylvanas/Uther cinematic?
[4:13:55] Relic7: Kappa
[4:13:57] pilhass10: lul
[4:14:05] dawnclaw22: he fell off :P
[4:14:13] Zivs: The clip of Kungen on Xy'mox is so good KEKW
[4:14:15] Treyeangowls: LUL
[4:14:20] Masqerader: When he didn't get world 1st anything and said the game was too easy?
[4:14:34] KingsandClubs: @zivs can you whisper me that clip?
[4:14:44] Zivs: @KingsandClubs ill see if I can find it
[4:14:44] Melonbrew: Game is on sale as well, I was thinking of getting it lol
[4:14:50] Thunderbrew: Funny how New World was gonna be the greatest.
[4:14:56] Polebegood: it seems the standard for games nowadays
[4:15:01] Thoreya: Hyped died down real quick
[4:15:05] Sarocus: But New World was soo much fun for the first few weeks
[4:15:07] Thoreya: Which I expected
[4:15:21] Thunderbrew: If they spent the money on development instead of advertising might have worked.
[4:15:29] IrrelevantFerret: They sold so many copies of NW, so I guess it worked
[4:15:31] Soeron: do we speak about the WoW killer New World?
[4:15:32] KingsandClubs: New world is a victim of overhype just like cyberpunk
[4:16:05] Bladerdiblaat: New world has nothing to offer, thats the problem
[4:16:13] Bladerdiblaat: end game wise
[4:16:15] Melonbrew: is New World still bricking 3000 series cards? or did that get fixed?
[4:16:17] 3663Sharad: The game concept is a great "casual" approach, with grinds that can be completed by elitsts and normals
[4:16:36] Thoreya: Asmon was checking the users last night. It’s been hovering around 100k
[4:16:42] Slitze: F that shit it'll eat my gpu
[4:17:07] Thunderbrew: How many servers?
[4:17:12] valianya: @towelliee  Khadgar explained it hurt him too much to see azeroth's champions fighting each other in war again with bfa so he stepped back and refused to take sides or get involved.  He went into seclusion in Kharazan to search the archives and seek answers to what happened to Medivh and to fully master the tower as Medivh 's successor.
[4:17:30] Masqerader: They made the same rookie mistake most companies do when launching a new MMO, they don't compensate for the tourist who are gonna quit in a 10 to 14 days so it leaves a trail of dead servers
[4:17:57] Qeevdo: Eso with 1 mega server might also have?
[4:18:00] Thoreya: Yeah that’s if all servers are like that tho
[4:18:23] Warchief_Guldahn: Copium
[4:18:36] dalaraz: its watermark taht made me quit
[4:18:40] Thunderbrew: I'm glad the Queue in FF14 is back to normal.
[4:18:57] Treyeangowls: were they ever able to recover the US East toons they deleted?
[4:19:02] Vashile: why was burty burt made in the first place if you were going to reroll?
[4:19:02] Thoreya: I just stick to WoW and other non MMOs. NW and FF don’t really interest me
[4:19:05] fewyn: at least you don't get 2002ed anymore
[4:19:06] Mallas2: jenova is pretty good until evening
[4:19:06] valianya: Can't you just rename Berty?
[4:19:08] cookeesz: @thunderbrew def isn’t
[4:19:20] Screamnsteam: WoW, no que at all EZ
[4:19:25] Thunderbrew: Brynhilder was a couple minutes to get in at 230pm pacific for me yesterday
[4:19:28] vollie95: Hello mate how you doing today?😎
[4:19:32] dalaraz: new world way of getting higher ilvl is terribler
[4:19:57] Slitze: cost you likr 160 bucks in battle net
[4:20:00] Masqerader: I love Terry's discord message for going live "short OW stream" 8 hrs later mofo still going
[4:20:02] rockthefries: have they done anything in terms of azoth cost for travel?
[4:20:15] Thoreya: Yeah
[4:20:47] Thunderbrew: I would drink like that if I worked for Blizzard right now
[4:20:53] 3663Sharad: @rockthefries They will change / have changed the formula
[4:20:58] flebbooo: Gotta sees the oppurtunity LUL

[4:21:43] 3663Sharad: SO bruv night is basically worktime LUL
[4:21:53] dalaraz: i bet he has a big crew and o nothing :p
[4:21:57] thorined: he works with asmon? PogChamp

[4:22:52] Masqerader: all roles are made up
[4:22:56] kweas1: hell even small companies have social media managers
[4:23:02] FrankTizzle: @Masqerader 5Head
[4:23:03] IrrelevantFerret: Late-stage capitalism alright FeelsBirthdayMan
[4:23:07] Bladerdiblaat: Yeah and most of the people are shit at it.
[4:23:08] Leokyn: So 1 figure job in blizzard
[4:23:29] Masqerader: we're saying role dangerously too much right now
[4:24:02] dranet11: https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1471636146698416129 what's this job role?
[4:24:30] MrGattz: its just someone trying to justify being upset
[4:24:43] Yurian33: All roles are made up
[4:24:49] dalaraz: prolly meaning its a fancy title on the role
[4:24:50] Relic7: In large companies there are certain roles that are redundant or could be merged - but clearly the role has been defined and created by a Director for a reason.
[4:24:50] Masqerader: Blizzard should be a 3 role company, tank, dps and healer
[4:24:56] Slitze: shut this idiot up
[4:24:57] Yurian33: just like all words are made up... they didnt show up out of the ether
[4:25:07] CrusaderNero: its bullshit jobs
[4:25:10] CrusaderNero: Kappa
[4:25:10] Rudric_Ice: so it's a cool name for marketing manager
[4:25:11] Screamnsteam: Rolls at Christmas Dinner
[4:25:15] ArkantosPlay: small pp and brain guy Kappa
[4:25:16] rekiosuTV: LUL

[4:25:27] keepcalmchris: That guy is having a bad morning lol
[4:25:33] Yurian33: the tew eweths
[4:25:37] Storm0118: watched that movie last week. Still hilarious even after a few times
[4:25:38] abracka_: it's 7 am why choose violence this early
[4:25:42] Dalsonson: All roles are made up because of societal norms, but what the role means and what the person does is not something new. That’s where people get confused
[4:25:51] Secondbreakfasttt: who's next lol
[4:26:07] jason_tacey: Must be upset he doesn't get his own "made up" role at work.
[4:26:09] RageQTT: All roles are made up when the need for them come up
[4:26:11] pinkphoenix90: When an entire industry adopts a 'role' and the definition for it, then it's not just made up on the spot <3
[4:26:28] keepcalmchris: LUL
[4:26:29] KingsandClubs: I think out of all the teams in blizzard thr cinematic one is the most appreciated one
[4:26:34] twistedstick1: towLets towGo
[4:26:35] Screamnsteam: we could give him a roll then say its made up Kappa
[4:26:37] Naturalbeef: These kids
[4:26:42] jason_tacey: Channel troll role LUL
[4:27:01] Leokyn: Channel Karen new role
[4:27:03] keepcalmchris: when you think about it, every role is made up lol
[4:27:09] OnyxLair77: What's TowelClaus going to bring this year?
[4:27:14] Yurian33: All this talk of rolls is making me hungry...
[4:27:18] Mockle: if the need for expertise comes up because the market demands it then it becomes a role --- its just that simple
[4:27:19] dranet11: europe...france...
[4:27:20] Slitze: 9099
[4:27:22] KingsandClubs: Didn’t they close offices in France?
[4:27:30] Naturalbeef: Mmmm Hawaiian Rolls
[4:27:41] valianya: Honestly at that global level he shouldn't be dealing directly with streamers himself.  Regional managers would be reporting zone stats and only major issues to him, and he'd be policy designer and middleman between the company heads and the regional influencer managers
[4:27:43] dalaraz: i guess there are 3-4 people under him working on regions
[4:28:02] 3663Sharad: French people refuse to speak english, soo his point counts LUL
[4:28:10] Ponickz: i havent seen lore in the channel in awhile
[4:28:12] jason_tacey: Loretta Stone
[4:28:14] Thoreya: praying this work day goes quick af
[4:28:18] Raaeni: do you think blizzard would ever sponsor streams?
[4:28:19] Relic7: Classic big giant company.
[4:28:27] Thoreya: blizz cant keep up with the times, need modern peeps
[4:28:28] Nokterian: shame they shutdown Blizzard France last year Sadge
[4:28:33] Masqerader: they just send u things when a new expac comes out
[4:28:39] dalaraz: a russian guy a chinese guy a hispanic guy etc,to be adaptable

[4:28:46] Dalsonson: Speaking of Lore and his job, has he said anything of a BlizzConline or is this year torched completely due to legal shit?
[4:29:01] KingsandClubs: They missed out on a Warcrafty Arcane and could of done it way wat earlier and made bank and good maretkig doing an animated series of Warcraft
[4:29:32] Keyastaron_: towelclause? Kappa
[4:29:33] Shrenko: @Dalsonson year is allmost over..
[4:29:35] zenFX_: @Clinophobia you'd be surprised how many french do speak english but they point blank refuse to

[4:29:49] Moobot: @darksos98 3/5 MOP World Mounts https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/HilariousLivelyLyrebirdFailFish-8yAgrAgowIq4WpjE
[4:29:50] FrankTizzle: @Dalsonson He's probably said stuff to Towellie but seeing as their friends IRL, Towellie won't say anything that Lore would prefer not go public
[4:29:55] Narktali: I'm french guys and i speak english Kappa
[4:30:22] 3663Sharad: Catch him, its a rere fish in the pond right here LUL
[4:30:27] 3663Sharad: *rare
[4:30:27] Dalsonson: I know they canceled Blizzcon, wasn’t sure if I missed an online convention announcement or not. Ty for that info Towel
[4:30:30] valianya: Blizzard don't have the writers for a good long term animated lore series
[4:30:37] FrankTizzle: that would be mindblowing
[4:30:43] FrankTizzle: Blizzard NEVER sponsors
[4:30:51] LSBreed: a sponsored WOW steam.... omg...
[4:30:51] Slitze: make ww great again?
[4:30:51] dranet11: big streamers play wow without needing to be paid by them though
[4:30:53] Thoreya: to be fair they didnt really need to. wow was huge
[4:30:53] Shrenko: nah everyone knows about wow at this point
[4:30:56] KingsandClubs: The fact is nowadays blizzard isen’t running a monopoly on MMORPG market,
[4:30:58] luckfore: they should do sponosered streams with 10.0 launch, it will be fucking huge
[4:30:59] KingsandClubs: Anymore
[4:31:08] 3663Sharad: Towel will be the first
[4:31:09] Yurian33: they were so big for so long its crazy how much they dont care about that stuff
[4:31:12] Keyastaron_: @progettazione_inferni  i got back into FFXIV at the beginning of this month its good but a bit slow for me playing WOW for 9 years its hard to change
[4:31:13] othraerir: how about 10cent? ;)
[4:31:27] Thoreya: they were on top of the world for a while so they prob felt like they didnt need to do any of that
[4:31:30] Slitze: incentive
[4:31:32] Naturalbeef: Swag'
[4:31:32] LSBreed: Tankspot .com
[4:31:34] mmo_kenna_: perks
[4:31:36] Gennzo: benefits?
[4:31:38] FrankTizzle: favors? trinkets?
[4:31:43] Shrenko: Blizzard has never needed to sponsor anyone
[4:31:45] 3663Sharad: Copium? LUL
[4:31:47] Birder_L: lootboxes
[4:31:52] FrankTizzle: friends/family/insider stuff
[4:31:55] Masqerader: swag
[4:32:03] IrrelevantFerret: Personal relationship with Kotick WutFace
[4:32:15] LSBreed: They don't even truly endorse the RWF.
[4:32:20] keepcalmchris: Damn I forgot about Ducksauce
[4:32:23] jasperboy: jasperboy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 122 months! 
[4:32:23] Yurian33: man what is Duck up to now... last i heard hes off in the woods with his woman
[4:32:30] Ponickz: What happened to Ducksauce?
[4:32:34] FrankTizzle: @LSBreed They go on record saying they don't want to, keep it a "community event"
[4:32:38] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  what about when soda was in that WoW trailer for WoWclassic
[4:32:50] dawnclaw22: 122 wtf
[4:32:52] 3663Sharad: Jebaited
[4:32:52] Nokterian: LUL LUL
[4:32:55] Bladerdiblaat: The voice of ducksauce in th3e morning was awesome
[4:33:08] danneler: lol
[4:33:09] luckfore: 122 months :O im not even that old yet
[4:33:12] valianya: Blizzard got lazy in competitive marketing and development because they were a monopoly for so long so it was take what scraps we give and you'll like it.
[4:33:14] FrankTizzle: @LSBreed Also the commentary would be a lot more tame if Blizzard sponsored the event; more PC or w/e
[4:33:17] MrGattz: been around a short minute
[4:33:19] Keyastaron_: ahh
[4:33:19] Ponickz: @Bladerdiblaat greatest voice
[4:33:29] LSBreed: @franktizzle it can be both. Them endorsing it doesn't necessarily take away from it being a community run event.
[4:33:37] KurumTV: It
[4:33:39] Korupcija_: they're kinda right though, shadowlands had 1M viewers on twitch without sponsors
[4:33:50] Korupcija_: classic had 1.1M
[4:33:53] Raidr211: that shield is BA looking @Towelliee
[4:34:00] MrGattz: @Volly yeah the majority of the high one dont talk in chat
[4:34:04] FrankTizzle: OMEGALUL
[4:34:06] Shrenko: D:
[4:34:06] Pippinn: hello
[4:34:08] Dalsonson: To be completely honest though, the Blizzard move of not paying creators when they’re gonna play xpac launches checks out
[4:34:18] ryanc1124: I watch in silence!

[4:34:33] MyriaK: Good thing New World threw so much money at Twitch streamers, definitely saved that game.
[4:34:37] mmo_kenna_: It's good for the WoW because there's so many good games out there now, wow has to buck it's ideas up

[4:35:05] a23pk: Don’t forget me @towelliee  but idk where my sub went ahahah
[4:35:10] LSBreed: @franktizzle they don't even have to put $ into it. Just promote it on launcher, Twitter, a twitch add. it will bring people to their game without direct sponsorship.
[4:35:10] Keyastaron_: dan the man Kappa
[4:35:14] temp3st98: 55 years of sub LUL

[5:08:53] KaisenSiru: I mean P1 with 3 Infernos is fine, P2 matters and with lust and unbridled, it can be killed before the second annihilate
[5:08:57] Zinaroth: I wish they had just done templates and removed gear from the equation for these specifically.
[5:09:03] severedfemoral: @osatox ooof sorry D:
[5:09:13] KaisenSiru: and my Dh was only level 54
[5:09:16] osatox: 9 stacks
[5:09:30] CaptainAlkohol: @Zinaroth i think its a fine way for not-so-skilled players to kinda outgear it
[5:09:31] cokezer0o: this fight was scaled for you to have a gem in every piece
[5:09:49] Nightshadre: @Towelliee popping unbridled fury potion before clikcing to enter the scenario will reset the pot countdown when you enter, and leave you with 25 seconds of the pot

[5:11:16] Rudric_Ice: I spent like 100k on consumes and gear just to do my  warrior challenge
[5:11:17] Zinaroth: @Zinaroth It was tuned with gear collection in mind. Just because a handful of players managed to do it without does not mean the tuning is right.
[5:11:27] hylexm: this just looks stupidly overtuned
[5:11:48] Rudric_Ice: then I was like I'm done not worth wasting 100k for a recolored mog

[5:13:19] CaptainAlkohol: @Zinaroth you have no objective evidence of that. forum andies complained back in legion just as they complain now. some challenges are harder than they were back then, some are easier, its impossible to recreate the exact same difficulty
[5:14:43] dalaraz: check if glaive throw kills the eyes @Towelliee
[5:14:45] DehCantao: dh flying back is so op
[5:15:11] Mockle: @DehCantao on my bear the knockback is what kills me 99% of the time
[5:15:20] Zinaroth: @CaptainAlkohol With specific templates everyone would encounter the exact same difficulty. I am all for gear making a difference in MMORPGs, in fact I am a huge advocate for it and hated Legion PvP for it's template function. But for this content, now, I think it makes more sense than having arbitrary legacy gear make you stronger.
[5:15:31] rikipy: OWLgg
[5:15:42] Aquadriel: WORD
[5:15:48] EclipticFate: sup dude
[5:15:52] sinlesssinner: thats harsh bro :)
[5:16:00] EclipticFate: suh
[5:16:12] Pfeilheld: it's not
[5:16:13] hylexm: it's also the truth
[5:16:18] Rudric_Ice: they Jebaited the casuals EZ gametime
[5:16:20] EclipticFate: werd to the world.. I never traveled that path
[5:16:21] luckfore: morgan said they now have all the tools to easily scale and tune old content current level characters
[5:16:24] ninousT: that was probably their whole plan was to make people go farm that old stuff
[5:16:28] Rudric_Ice: I mean subs
[5:16:34] Zinaroth: The only good thing about this is that I am more motivated to farm Dragon Soul mounts now that the gems sell for so much.
[5:16:36] CaptainAlkohol: @Zinaroth well not everyone encountered the same difficulty back then since you could majorly outgear it. every single challenge is doable without any special gear, if you need it, go farm it
[5:16:40] Pfeilheld: just because some ppl can't do it doesn't mean is done wrong
[5:16:48] EclipticFate: couldn't get over the scaling in WoW, drove me fucking crazy from first second
[5:17:06] Fragglevision: y'all just need to git gud
[5:17:08] Fragglevision: :P
[5:17:15] Aquadriel: @Towelliee they didnt want us to use our legion borrowed power but had us go for 'borrowed' power from legacy gear KEKW
[5:17:19] Fragglevision: jk, i havent touched retail in months
[5:17:35] Zinaroth: @CaptainAlkohol Everyone outgeared it back then eventually the same cannot be said now. You can disagree with me but I am not going to change my mind. They fucked up big time with the tuning.
[5:18:31] Captain_nShaneO: wait.. mage towers are back??
[5:18:37] EclipticFate: I see wow DOES have far cam, but what the hell.. feel like I missed out, and I can't be bothered to fight controllers in console games like halo either... feels bad though
[5:18:43] hylexm: so nasty
[5:18:56] Prayshock: the eyes dont take physical damage right?
[5:18:58] Rudric_Ice: if mage tower came out  unchanged from the ptr people wouldn't have complained so much
[5:19:00] CaptainAlkohol: @Zinaroth i dont see the difference between waiting 12 months for new patches to outgear it or just farming some old pieces rn except you can do one NOW and people had to wait back then? much better imo
[5:19:10] Korupcija_: k

[5:19:55] K9kal: @CaptainAlkohol I think MT is only open for another 2 weeks
[5:20:05] dracullus: in 7.3 I did Agatha on all specs same day, it was seriously a joke
[5:20:07] Craziex: hello, what do you get from doing this thing?
[5:20:11] Zinaroth: @CaptainAlkohol If it was up 24/7 I could be inclined to agree on that point but then again that is a whole other pain point.
[5:20:45] Klambjorn: Think the druid healer one became hard because increased healing was bad at the end fight
[5:21:07] Zinaroth: WoW needs more evergreen content in general. Time limiting things like these makes little sense to me. I don't see why they had to be part of a TW rotation.
[5:21:09] CaptainAlkohol: well 4 weeks should be plenty to get some socketed pieces and it will come back every legion timewalk. but i agree that it should be up permanently
[5:21:24] Sollice: Good morning everyone
[5:21:39] amricatt: towLets towGo
[5:21:49] EclipticFate: I love how NOTHING EVER has changed in gamer views, positions, stances, differences. Like I still feel exactly the same as the early days in my gaming. And still differ in specific ways to other people. It's because the community of gamers aside from very small groups is incoherent... if that's the word I'm thinking of
[5:21:54] cokezer0o: LOL
[5:22:03] Zinaroth: @CaptainAlkohol For one spec or one char? Sure. I just like availability. I don't like this engagement driven way of running the game.
[5:22:03] Craziex: what do you get from doing this?
[5:22:04] DinkytheDoodle: It’s like watching a monkey hump a football
[5:22:07] sinlesssinner: sub retention bro

[5:22:14] sinlesssinner: you cant have fun all the time :)
[5:22:17] Davcev: they also need to make balance of power achi boa
[5:22:20] cokezer0o: if torghast is here forever so could this
[5:22:27] kharnij83: its like the McRib some reason they just keep taking it away
[5:22:31] Firelordxsrx: I think you should be permanent
[5:22:37] SmokedHog: I literally got 6 months because of the baby murlock
[5:22:42] sinlesssinner: then ppl would be done with it sooner tho, so unsubing after they are done :)
[5:22:42] maalow: permanently and make timewalking events a weekly rotation, on top of other events
[5:22:49] m3rk_zion: I feel they should allow us to scale it like dungeons, Normal, Heroic, Mythic, Mythic+ and allow groups where they have personalized loot not
[5:22:57] Farrgrim: flask
[5:23:06] reggiepowa: @overzealotz could have just bought it on the store separately
[5:23:10] SmokedHog: mythic + gets boring AF after a while
[5:23:14] Korupcija_: technical difficulties, you wouldn't undertand 🤓
[5:23:20] Thoreya: mage tower shud always be up, along with legion m+. m+ needs more dungeons in the list
[5:23:25] cokezer0o: the coolest things dont last
[5:23:27] dracullus: or just turn on MT with every timewalking
[5:23:29] Thoreya: hopefully 10.0 they revamp some old dungeons
[5:23:31] cokezer0o: cant have to much fun
[5:23:34] Thoreya: for m+
[5:23:37] SmokedHog: @reggieswag14 needed 6 months anyway haha
[5:23:43] JonnyScotland: That's what's been wrong with Blizzard, frustrating players with stuff that doesn't make sense.
[5:24:00] reggiepowa: @overzealotz then it's a good deal
[5:24:23] SmokedHog: doesn't matter what it is, players will always complain about blizz
[5:24:26] Rudric_Ice: boosters are now selling mage tower runs too my guildmate even payed for his druid one lol
[5:24:30] SmokedHog: have to keep blizz on their toes
[5:24:54] LORDGARGALON: shruggers
[5:24:55] Redoake: You want a weakaura for the debuff? Got a link to it
[5:25:02] Screamnsteam: @Rudi_Ice how is that even possible
[5:25:09] Zinaroth: @overzealotz WoW is simply being held to a higher standard than any other MMORPG that is popular right now and that is a good thing IMO.
[5:25:24] R2RHIN0: Thats account sharing...
[5:25:34] Davcev: TAHST LITERALLY ACC SHARE LUL
[5:25:34] Theduskflyer: AND they should bring back the weapon tmogs. This coming from someone who has the ones I wanted. The whole, it’s meaningful to the people who got it is bullshit. Lots of shit on BMAH that was meaningful to people who got it back in the day. T3, Mounts, etc.
[5:25:34] Mallaes: yeah
[5:25:35] JonnyScotland: People bought boosts for mage tower in Legion too. My friend done it
[5:25:38] JonnyScotland: it's not new

[5:25:53] cokezer0o: what happens when you log on your friend account
[5:25:55] DehCantao: maybe not real money, but definitely account sharing
[5:25:58] Melonbrew: They do shit like that in Destiny 2, They call it account recoveries
[5:26:13] cokezer0o: is it a perma ban?
[5:26:21] CaptainAlkohol: @cokezer0o if they catch you yes
[5:26:26] lahroy: !oondaata
[5:26:27] retro_justice: @DehCantao rmt FOR account sharing aha
[5:26:27] Screamnsteam: @cokezer0o situational
[5:26:31] SmokedHog: don't get got
[5:26:34] JonnyScotland: @cokezer0o 6 months ban, it used to be a slap in the wrists, not anymore
[5:26:36] Rudric_Ice: he said he's not even scared of getting banned he knows blizzard ain't doin shit to ban people

[5:26:50] hylexm: they did. the new anti cheat reduced it in D2 quite a bit
[5:26:56] cokezer0o: wow so you cant even log onto a friend account without jail time
[5:26:56] tonyr23: anyone know if towlie has done guardian druid mage tower yet
[5:27:08] CaptainAlkohol: @cokezer0o and that is a good thing yeah
[5:27:11] JonnyScotland: @Rudi_Ice they are doing stuff about that if you get caught, I know this as I have a serbian friend whos a gold seller, and his customers got hit cause he was sloppy
[5:27:14] dracullus: 3/5 MOP world mounts? what's 5th?
[5:27:57] JonnyScotland: it's normally a 6 month ban for the booster buyer and perma for the booster back to their account now, It used to be they didn't ban the boosters account if they didn't do anything dodgy on it, now they do
[5:27:59] cokezer0o: @CaptainAlkohol its a good thing for you not to be able to log onto somebodys accoutn with ther epermission in what way
[5:28:24] cokezer0o: how does that benefit you other then blizzard
[5:28:34] cokezer0o: so they can milk max money
[5:28:48] JonnyScotland: Also had a friend who sold gold as a one off, instant perma banned , no idea how he got caught

[5:28:54] CaptainAlkohol: @cokezer0o because it stops degenerate boosting shit. and how does that make blizz money
[5:29:19] CaptainAlkohol: you could legit boost entire guilds to CE in the first weeks if that was allowed
[5:29:21] cokezer0o: @CaptainAlkohol it forces people to have to all pay for there own accounts instead of fmaily sharing one
[5:29:31] cokezer0o: family

[5:29:59] AugustoAlvs: !oondasta
[5:30:06] cokezer0o: its all down for max profit blizzard dont care about booosting dude @CaptainAlkohol
[5:30:09] DehCantao: @Zinaroth I believe this is legal
[5:30:12] JonnyScotland: @Zinaroth he's allowed to if he's under 13
[5:30:37] Zinaroth: I don't even live in NA so that age restriction means nothing to me. But he's 8 for reference.
[5:30:41] kekelsfloorpov: How many pulls has he had
[5:30:44] cokezer0o: if blizzard made money from boosting they would do it too
[5:31:05] Rudric_Ice: my nephew plays from my account sometimes I nvr got banned
[5:31:17] K9kal: I think they catch people when they notice the account when it's being accessed by a different IP address then normal
[5:31:28] Zinaroth: As long as it's from the same PC I don't see  how they would tell anyway.
[5:31:30] CaptainAlkohol: @cokezer0o ok mr tinfoil. acc sharing has been abused in a lot of ways in the past, its just the lesser evil. also its not like people dont share accs in their family, blizz aint gonna ban you if your acc does worldquests all day from the same IP adress
[5:31:41] WhiteKnight74648: Nice hat ^_^
[5:31:50] amricatt: As a general rule of thumb, I'd stop talking about account sharing in a public forum.
[5:31:52] Zinaroth: BTW multibotting is bannable now, right?
[5:32:02] seazunn: whatcha eating good
[5:32:04] wpprrz: @Zinaroth no
[5:32:07] osatox: @Zinaroth nope
[5:32:15] cokezer0o: @CaptainAlkohol all fmaily doesnt liv ein the same house
[5:32:19] cokezer0o: family
[5:32:19] DehCantao: @Zinaroth using software to transmit key pressing is banable. multiboxing is not.
[5:32:22] osatox: just cant use things that make it "easy" such as hardware or software
[5:32:22] Zinaroth: I am sure they imposed some kind of restriction?
[5:32:24] JonnyScotland: @Zinaroth no, multiboxing with a program that makes all characters attack at same time is
[5:32:24] wickedmgg: cant use input stuff yea
[5:32:28] Armdel: if you use a program for it yes
[5:32:31] Zinaroth: Ah okay
[5:32:37] rockthefries: you would have to alt tab to do it
[5:32:43] JonnyScotland: I multibox but 2 of my characters are on follow and don't do anything, I do it to farm sha etc
[5:32:43] Zinaroth: Explains why I still see 5 druids flying around gathering herbs.
[5:32:44] CaptainAlkohol: unlucky @cokezer0o

[5:33:11] Stropalot: you can still do hardware multiboxing
[5:33:15] EmpathyLiveChat: I report players who look like they might be multiboxing
[5:33:20] Rudric_Ice: time to ban sloot  Kappa
[5:33:21] ProClicker: Now they use a bunch of pc's to multi box
[5:33:29] JonnyScotland: @Zinaroth you can have druids flying easily, also just because something isn't allowed doens't mean people wont do it
[5:33:36] KaisenSiru: pieNom
[5:33:42] wpprrz: @EmpathyLiveChat but multiboxing isnt against TOS
[5:33:42] sooziecuzie: Sloot has his follow and tabs to do whatever.

[5:52:12] AlphasaurusRexx: @Towelliee rotate your sigils to interrupt. dont need to use orbs on dh except for "oh shit" situations. you have two sigils that interrupt their cast.
[5:52:15] Contendedlemon: wow music stopped at the right time
[5:52:24] KaisenSiru: The DW currency is called Essence of Corrupted Deathwing btw, for epic gem clusters
[5:52:32] Triggeredaf: Yeah :p

[5:52:40] nike_eredar: yep
[5:52:43] JediNeo99999: Velen will do about 1% of kruuls hp if you have it left
[5:52:44] gold9871: he can under 1k hp
[5:52:45] kimmo_gaming: of course, Justus killed it like that Kappa
[5:53:09] gold9871: one is a aoe fear
[5:53:10] AlphasaurusRexx: no, but for the netherwalker things
[5:53:34] Rktmx: why would u interrupt annihilate? he just recasts it
[5:53:35] Ozharos: !magetower
[5:53:51] AlphasaurusRexx: blue and purple will stop their cast. blue just needs to go off after their cast.
[5:54:05] Ordicos: yeah he got me werebear back in legion as i got knocked off at 0.1% so velen won it for me
[5:54:09] WhiteKnight74648: I remember Siege of Ogrimarr and doing the fight where you could have Gamon help you out. They didnt tune Gamon's damage yet and when we wiped, Gamon took out the remainging 3% health and we got the kill
[5:54:15] cokezer0o: how about pally bubule and bop
[5:54:22] cokezer0o: thats op
[5:54:27] Aquadriel: yeah but with dh you can fuck up as many knock backs as you want LUL
[5:54:43] m3rk_zion: Yeah Bears have a stupidly high survival rate over most tanks as far as I know
[5:54:52] AlphasaurusRexx: i feel like dh gets more infernals than other tanks.
[5:55:25] cokezer0o: your a pretty good tank man
[5:55:54] roguening: just save orbs from p1
[5:55:59] Aquadriel: man iam dreading doing this on my blood DK.. i remember it was a struggle back in legion

[5:56:24] mmrghost7: do u think we will ever have spec oriented expansion like legion again ?
[5:56:41] cruzeal: brew is ez
[5:56:45] AlphasaurusRexx: @Aquadriel it was easier than dh imo. Rotate bonestorm and seed pod every netherwalker spawn and it's a cakewalk
[5:56:57] Aquadriel: you got shitty positioning of fel pools too, it fucked your visibility of orbs.
[5:57:20] Gameriders: !OONDASTA

[5:57:23] cokezer0o: the dps challenges to me werew really easy it was the tank and healing one that tramutized me
[5:57:28] Aquadriel: AlphasaurusRexx i see. i havent prepared at all for it, prolly wont try it this time around, but will see.
[5:58:14] cokezer0o: i just didnt have the dps for the tank one
[5:58:20] cokezer0o: but finally did it
[5:58:38] AlphasaurusRexx: i did it in all SLands gear minus the seed pod trinket. dk has so much aoe the infernals dead often. pull the boss to the far left side on pull and the eyes all spawn close to you.
[5:59:06] AlphasaurusRexx: and blood boil has a deceptively long range
[5:59:57] Gillrad: just curious, why aren't you using the silencing sigil for the adds?

[6:00:21] Gillrad: oh ok, didn't know if there was a reason for it
[6:00:35] AlphasaurusRexx: lol. felt like i was RP walking around during the challenge compared to DH. DH mobility is nutty
[6:00:44] m3rk_zion: Here's a Question for you, out of all the expansions which one has the best soundtrack? In my opinion it's a toss up between WOD and Wrath
[6:00:48] DigitalChill: Matrix any good? Gonna watch today..
[6:01:08] KaisenSiru: Draenor Kreygasm
[6:01:11] retro_justice: @Digitalchill its getting roasted but i enjoyed it, dont expect it to be good as the first one lol
[6:01:15] MrGattz: panda land had some good music to though
[6:01:15] Black1992: Draenor's cinematic theme was king imo
[6:01:18] retro_justice: its like a 7/10
[6:01:30] Detonite: BFA has the most beautiful sound
[6:01:30] DigitalChill: SeemsGood ty
[6:01:32] EmpathyLiveChat: I did like some of the BFA music.
[6:01:33] m3rk_zion: Yeah I'd have to go WOD WOTLK and then BFA and Legion.

[6:27:07] TyndiVelspaz: yes. OR maybe they just don't like your face.
[6:27:24] AlphasaurusRexx: @Towelliee no, they just aggro if youre attacking the boss when they spawn
[6:27:36] AlphasaurusRexx: same with Dk

[6:29:56] retro_justice: times*
[6:30:02] KaisenSiru: Ahh
[6:30:27] Autoexeq: I think they don't on Paladin because you have more ranged so it's a class specific thing to pick them up.
