[1:54:04] Tilly4Rilly1337: Nvidea has an overlay that causes lag , most people do not use it, so just disable
[1:54:06] zero__co0l: test it^^
[1:54:13] leon_158: Mmm ok
[1:54:40] FONGHH: oh :o if it lags it s a problem
[1:54:59] FONGHH: @Tilly4Rilly1337 does the background blur effect cause lag aswell?
[1:55:05] Tilly4Rilly1337: @Swifty If you experience stream and or game lag, just open task manager during spikes to see the processes running.
[1:55:16] Tilly4Rilly1337: @Tilly4Rilly1337 Yes, I disable all blurr effects
[1:55:22] Tilly4Rilly1337: like, why not see clearly lol
[1:55:25] Foe009: why AH is closed?
[1:55:43] FONGHH: @Tilly4Rilly1337 it is used for the background..
[1:55:57] TheFernandeez: what UI is this ?
[1:56:29] kragnos0: I feel AH is def been buggy since the region wide implementation. Give it some time to clear up @Foe009
[1:56:32] Foe009: yeah, auction house is not working atm
[1:56:36] Tilly4Rilly1337: @Tilly4Rilly1337 So, if you understand anything about competative gaming... those that often win have all their settings turned down except for draw distance, Anti-Aisling, and resolution. View should be 101 at max or 90 preferred.  Rest is fluff

[1:57:54] Galdrena: @Tilly4Rilly1337 that's not what Swifty is doing. He's seeing if Nvidia Broadcast will blur the cam background not in game stuff
[1:58:54] Tilly4Rilly1337: @Galdrena We aren't talking about Swifty at this point in the tangent.  The original idea was lag.  What we are talking about is something else. Stay on topic. Anyway, to add to my example: shadows. You might think you hiding in a dark spot but gamma + brightness = you are not hiding LOL
