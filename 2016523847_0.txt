[0:14:09] btyr_Cloud: the problem now is that the armor plates only cover like 40% of the body, so any bullet that ccan pen class 2, for the most part, can kill anyone through their armor

[0:58:56] TheG4MER14: if they would have just ripped off twitch 1 for 1 like Kick did, then I think Mixer would have been successful
[0:58:56] Rayzum88: They don't offer anything different/better and twitch is already established as the main streaming platform. Gotta come with something special to take over.

[1:43:29] vvactor1: Yep
[1:43:34] Snubzie: @Jakeyboy1052009 both, but they reworked it for this wipe and so far it feels really underwhelming as far as protection goes.
[1:43:35] MAERYUS: @Artiriouz in normal version you level up faster or?
[1:43:37] TheYellaKing: they probably grbbed the key
[1:43:39] TheYellaKing: and are up in the office
[1:43:44] Suaden: GOTEM
[1:43:52] JJROKCZ: the recoil change is garbage, this should not be so easy this early
[1:43:55] Artiriouz: @MAERYUS yeah in retail you level way faster, content is a little more challenging
[1:43:55] AceOfHalo2: Best part now is that you have to pick and choose your fights now. Getting throated will be the end of you lol
[1:43:55] Klaytn: w
[1:43:57] sap_yaps: with the lower recoil maybe they could make a console port now (without aim assist)
[1:44:02] The_Rhym: he can jump out the window
[1:44:06] RevenantNeverDies2009: @snubzie what kinda armor you talking? if its some random helmet in an apartment its prolly not gonna do shit against an ak47

[1:45:03] texx1n: @qjuramentada Oooo nice
[1:45:04] Snubzie: @Jakeyboy1052009 Chest armor was what was reworked. Now there's a lot of gaps between the plates. More realistic, but you can die now without your armor doing anything. before it used to cover your whole torso regardless.

[2:12:27] Carld2: !settings
[2:12:27] Fossabot: @Carld2, Looking for settings for a specific game? Try the game name followed by settings - like !eftsettings or !cs2settings
[2:12:28] Fictitious1267: the GL location had a roller on the desk going in
[2:12:29] Fox56: 1% is my constant KEKW
[2:12:30] Flekz127: he should try out street of tarkov and let the BTR melt down people lol
[2:12:34] Zakeesha: you dont rifle through things aggressively so the armed men around can hear you? i certainly do
[2:12:39] Carld2: !settings tarkov
[2:12:46] pkmn_canada: is this landmark?
[2:12:48] jsseeee: that tapping recoil looks pretty realistic

[2:12:57] Jehenem: Love how theres spectating and death cams in arenas but not the main game
[2:13:07] yewfuknwot: try gaming in australia... lmao
[2:13:09] Carld2: cheers
[2:13:13] FaDezZ__: mtape
[2:13:21] GiraffeMofo: how does he have bp? lol
[2:13:29] ZZjarosz: @Jehenem death cams would be silly in squads
[2:13:30] littleryzhy: @jehenem how many people who would called out in discord I'm glad it's not in the main game
[2:13:31] Nadool: @Jehenem it makes sense for arena
[2:13:34] secksmachine69: @GiraffeMofo got off dead player last match
[2:13:41] GiraffeMofo: @GiraffeMofo ah ok
[2:13:47] rabireason: no this is the Krusty krab
[2:13:49] JayBoost: @Jehenem you really think this should have a death cam?? so you can just calll out to your teammate?
[2:13:53] FaDezZ__: @shroud  m-tape on the toolkit location
[2:13:53] pkmn_canada: is there a boss for this map?
[2:13:55] bhmotorsportslive: All games struggle with it, yes. But EFT has an unusually large amount of them. H@xers, I mean. And I really like Shroud but, to a degree all of them have to be doing it to keep from losing revenue, at this point.

[2:14:24] General_HAM: @goospeddle its 25% off rn
[2:14:27] JackHammer3: Never fully understood this game. If you dont go looting on wipe, what else do you do?
[2:14:29] Jehenem: Maybe not death cam but spectating teammates should be in the main game when you die
[2:14:30] Tasarorm: Damn this map is sick
[2:14:31] littleryzhy: Don't forget you can left shoulder peak now
[2:14:36] secksmachine69: wat

[2:14:43] Ghaladeon: @jayboost You don't seem to understand the survival genre. You are dead = nothing more to do
[2:14:45] DiniVibez: @JackHammer3 tasks
[2:14:48] iFalco: @JackHammer3 theres quests too
[2:14:49] NoobShiesty: did they fix the cheating or nah?
[2:14:50] KontrolStyle: @Muffelll, don't think so
[2:14:51] JackHammer3: gotcha
[2:14:58] cantgetriight: @JackHammer3 get kills, sell guns, level up
[2:15:07] IamBramer: I think top floor of the building you were in has gun
