[2:15:36] Tears_0f_sin: yeah that's actually really dumb @LinK99191 i can understand m+ not being as high as mythic raid but under heroic is so dumb
[2:16:02] bob_tables: I only fully cleared N CN, but why is the last 2 bosses the easiest in the raid? And is this the case for HC too_
[2:16:06] LinK99191: It shouldn’t be as high as mythic raid but yeah below heroic is just silly
[2:16:21] inkstainedadventure: I lift a dram of Ardbeg to all Vengeance, Prots, and Brewmasters in the house
[2:16:46] Saiteck: as it should be
[2:16:50] Spathotan: A heroic raid is technically harder than a mythic dungeon, why would the dungeon drop better gear
[2:17:13] LinK99191: Yeah I just disagree with that philosophy at least let 15s drop heroic gear
[2:17:14] sneakyobese: s
[2:17:26] LinK99191: 15s are way harder then heroic raid wat

[2:22:27] OG_Yaowa: I like the vibe for the season, nothing feels forced
[2:22:28] jdog1360: sludge isn't bad if you control rubble alot of groups don't control it
[2:22:32] LinK99191: There’s a decent chance they have to nerf sludge fist because the dps check is too high on mythic
[2:22:42] LinK99191: Depending on what the scaling is
[2:24:16] jasonbriggs: will they run with 25 in raids
[2:24:39] Chris_127: love how unbalanced torghast is from class to class mages are so bad in there
[2:24:53] jdog1360: sludge literally is a mechanic fight you have to wait for all 4 pillars and have to control ruble all while not really moving

[2:48:25] jasonbriggs: open up the dungeon icon
[2:48:33] Endymion32: for new ppl lfg is way faster to gear up
[2:48:34] 2GramsofJam: same as queuing for a regular dungeon but there's a drop down on top right to change difficulty
[2:48:44] rhkka: ohh thanks for help i was struggling
[2:48:57] jasonbriggs: no probs
[2:48:58] brucezhu: nah I guess you cant queue for heroic unless you have ilvl 155, I think he only has 150

[2:51:24] brucezhu: jailer loot is weekly
[2:51:27] tkbrummett: Is the mythic+ tracker thing on top right a weak aura or an addon?
[2:51:33] 2GramsofJam: ohhh wrath of the jailer is an elite mob?? I was wondering what that icon was in the maw all this time
[2:51:40] CloudPants8081: cohhEZ no cp?
[2:52:00] brucezhu: it's a small encounter, you go into the area, kill some mobs, then an elite will spawn, and you kill it for loot

[2:53:56] 2GramsofJam: enh is good, but ppl don't like melee dps and there's an enh stigma so depends if u got a group already
[2:53:57] Tatiipoewz: what ilvl you get from +10?
[2:53:58] Laffitaffi11: can someone pleasse tell me if we have to use our anima to upgrade our convenats? does it help with gear or anything? or can i use it on the cosmetics or mounts without losing out on gearing?
[2:54:24] 2GramsofJam: pugging as enh has been a bit of a struggle
[2:55:21] SpaceMedjay: @Laffitaffi11 anima is only for cosmatics

[2:57:58] Discobuble: Unless you allready got them
[2:58:08] jasonbriggs: play what you enjoy playing
[2:58:14] brucezhu: Wait, did you skip any trash? Thought this dungeon was pretty linear
[2:58:34] Endymion32: @freebieee btwquests is nice for new player, deadly boss mods is a must, details for dps meter, a good nameplate addon like plater also really helps

[3:44:04] Tears_0f_sin: have you noticed that dps people only interrupt things when dbm tells them to
[3:44:22] Tears_0f_sin: like other things out there hurt like a bitch but if dmb doesn't say to kick it they just sit there never using their kick
[3:44:56] SlyXDog: That's why I use Exorsus LUL
[3:45:17] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @Tears_0f_sin on my dps alt i kick,what i think is necessary. dbm sometimes even wont telll u to kick important stuff,when u dont have said enemy as a current target

[3:48:13] wigglenobber: yo @Towelliee which covenant did you choose bro
[3:48:18] Tears_0f_sin: hope so, the highest m+ giving lower gear than heroic raid is dumb
[3:48:21] Discobuble: Do you think they have made the dungeons a bit harder intentionally so that people would have a harder time gearing up before the RWF?
[3:48:38] chrisbros: @towelliee what happens if you dont beat the timer?

[4:16:10] wommy: gearing is way too slow now
[4:16:18] Masqerader: or walking through the maw which is REALLY slow lol
[4:16:18] wigglenobber: back to the same ol same ol. but its fressh
[4:16:26] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: srsly i have been abandoning maw quests. its so boring
[4:16:31] Heavuh: Do you think shadowlands is/will be better than Legion?
[4:16:38] Zettabyte: time for ore farming then @Towelliee :tf:
[4:16:43] Kromede: maw is terrible
[4:17:09] Erendyr: i hope gearing stays this way, i think its better this way rather than being capped on loot 3 weeks in
[4:17:10] pavepawns: is it the next raid that gets tier sets
[4:17:14] pavepawns: or the one after
[4:17:18] Gorestack: people got too spoiled by gear showers in Legion/BFA, outgearing raids before even entering them was degenerate gameplay
[4:17:21] CADZtv: i agree with max's tweet tho were just in withdrawal right now
[4:17:23] Zettabyte: The Maw FeelsBadMan
[4:17:29] wigglenobber: i havent seen the castle yet, you enjoy that?
[4:17:30] Villie: I really like the new item system, if someone has a lot of gear, you know he earned it
[4:17:35] ambiotic: it has started better than legion
[4:18:04] Erendyr: Definitely dont want warforging to come back tho
[4:18:24] Valearleen: this system is soo much better..... i hope ppl stop crying so blizz dont change it
[4:18:51] Fhirn: sadly but true
[4:18:51] Menion01: Alt friendly expansion where nobody has time to keep up with alts.
[4:19:09] akia03: running 6 m+s and zero gear isnt going to keep people doing m+
[4:19:11] KYANGOz: I just feel discouraged from running M+ since I have timed 25+ keys and have only gotten 3 drops
[4:19:34] R4d1o4ct1v3_: I wish they rewarded us for doing raids in big groups, rather than small ones.
[4:19:35] Valearleen: @KYANGOz hum i find that hard to believe ngl
[4:19:37] Menion01: That's because you play WOW for a living...
[4:19:44] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: i just want M+ to get the same ilvl than raid,cause i dont have a guild

[4:20:38] pavepawns: hes loving keys arti not the rewards being diminished
[4:20:39] ninjitsu124: naw m+ needs to drop higher itl gear shits rediculous
[4:20:44] Villie: Classic primed us really good for the less loot system
[4:20:47] Heavuh: Will tier gear return this xpac?
[4:20:49] kodtheog: i think there should be a level of reward for the people who grind a lot
[4:21:02] EpicJune: Just bring back tokens imho
[4:21:06] kodtheog: but i do agree the loot is trash in mythic keys its a little wild
[4:21:18] Gorestack: people run dungeons for 10 hours and then feel exhausted... LUL
[4:21:23] Erendyr: maybe the titan residuum system shouldve been here from the start, like the pve version of conquest, like m+ dropping currency
[4:21:25] Skylin3r: you still grind, but don't get anything out of it
[4:21:40] Villie: Loot is fine, maybe increase the anima a@oh t
[4:22:27] toogoo: i agree with max

[4:22:46] Recording_on_the_grass: zerg of casuals
[4:22:49] kodtheog: i think torghast is a very unrewarding especially since we are gonna have our legendaries fully upgrading so why would we keep going there?
[4:22:50] Auru: i mean the gear is shit. Its raid to gear atm.
[4:22:53] Srylnir: The question is how long it takes to get used to it.
[4:22:54] BjornOtter: how did towelliee get famous for playing wow ?
[4:22:54] fallengladius: like Kungen that rage quit
[4:22:57] Menion01: Yes
[4:23:01] CADZtv: if we go back to it like it was in bfa then people are gnna say we have to much lol
[4:23:05] Heavuh: Why did they remove bonus rolls?
[4:23:10] Daggerstry: My guild already stopped raiding because they cleared all of normal raid and they only got 3 pieces of loot
[4:23:13] Artivicii: LUL
[4:23:15] kalamari__: @Towelliee I am playing more different parts of the game now, because I can get gear from it. havent done that in BfA at all

[4:23:19] Artivicii: draenor slootS
[4:23:30] R4d1o4ct1v3_: I'm afraid this will mean it'll be harder for casuals to get into raids/M+, since the hard-core players will be optimizing for loot. (Small skilled groups = better)
[4:23:39] sarcilav: my guild went from 30 man groups to hardly getting 20 to complete normal
[4:23:44] Deadly26: I remember running over 300 M+ on legion launch for my first legendary
[4:23:48] BjornOtter: @Daggerstry theres about 3 pieces per boss though
[4:23:54] Artivicii: raids dropping hella loot rn
[4:24:00] BjornOtter: @Daggerstry more actually
[4:24:01] Recording_on_the_grass: took over 100 dungeons to get 196 il
[4:24:13] kodtheog: yeah thats a lie the gear is very well dropped in raid right now
[4:24:18] Ex__Shinra: 3 PER 20 people, so if your going in with more than 20 then it may be working as intended

[4:25:04] kodtheog: i just started playing the game and im considered casual probably but ive been able to grind and get into a guild do heroics, and normal raid with high level keys so i really think for casuals to complain its dumb put the work in ull get rewards i like the system
[4:25:09] Noobslicer: Elitist will become even more elitist.. and ppl will require insane ilvl for even low m+.. FOR SURE
[4:25:26] ambiotic: the casuals love the cosmetics of the covenants and all the rares that drop backs and xmogs and what not
[4:25:49] King_M4ntus: drenor was no fun, shadowlands is fun coming from a casual :D
[4:25:52] Chris_127: as a casual its pretty annoying going from m0s being the best gear to this week i already feel it and never get invited to groups have no guild etc
[4:25:58] Zettabyte: i miss the farm in MoP Kappa
[4:26:00] R4d1o4ct1v3_: Yea. I'm a casual player. I want to raid and do M+, but I'm not going to be doing a job interview, background check and a test period to get into a guild LUL
[4:26:09] Heavuh: Do you think tier needs a return?
[4:26:10] actuallygriefing: @Noobslicer I mean if it's their key, it's their requirements on who they invite. If you don't like it, just start your own group instead
[4:26:11] Crystalyzee: you mean conduit collecting right since thats all ive been doing in m+ blizz removed gear from my loot table
[4:26:27] kodtheog: you dont have to do a backround check to get into guilds or groups you jsut have to put the work in
[4:26:44] Scruffy_Robot: It might help if they turn on legacy damage for Legion
[4:27:11] ambiotic: the ??? trinket is a trap in raid i need to ditch it
[4:27:13] its_andyd: which trinket??
[4:27:18] R4d1o4ct1v3_: @kaeod that has not been my experience. If I couldn't link an archive of acievements and a pile of whatever raider scores people go for these days, I'm not even considered.
[4:27:24] Kelticlore: I've missed Teir's

[4:28:24] Artivicii: separation of power should be apparent considering how many casuals play
[4:28:26] Skylin3r: imo instead of creating 4 versions of same content they need to create more unique content

[4:45:36] bad_fish_too: Does 550 conquest cap go up week to week?
[4:45:54] MuttonChopins: they might end up getting nerf since they are the best for M+ runs right now @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect
[4:45:56] CADZtv: wait how did peices loose to method for heroic ino its not mythic but still
