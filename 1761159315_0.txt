[2:39:19] Kezeth: Im worried about Cheese improving their time so much, at this rate they'll be the fastest team and get eliminated.
[2:39:27] Winnnie: @Latensify it's a free trial, but you have to buy the expansion at the discount price. it's a gimmic to get people to buy the expansion lol
[2:39:28] torx10: Mods, PS CHeese full live
[2:39:29] Latensify: @moderatygos But does trial not indicate a period of time where you have full access? Its nothing to do with me, I have the game and a sub, but nobody I know who is a former WoW player is interested because of the restrictions.

[3:00:21] Sheepeo: Why do they restart the dungeon guys ?
[3:00:39] moderatygos: @Sheepeo they can restart if they know they won't have a good time, if they wipe or pull the wrong trash or something
[3:00:43] Xiyoth: @leo94 i make the orc yell louder and glow redish then probabbly nerf it like 15% but it would last like 5% longer
[3:00:47] Octem: if they think they wont get a good enough time, might as well start and try again
[3:00:56] 0co2l: Looks like that this add-on is one that hasn't forgotten the ferals :-)
[3:01:05] potatofarmer: @Sheepeo theyh need to put up a good time, not just complete the dungeon. Can reset as often as possible.

[3:05:18] moderatygos: 5 hours per day all weekend, 15 total hours
[3:05:22] Culver42: So question from a noob on this, is there a rule where they have to stop the run when the last boss dies? why do they just say the run is killed if they don't have count? can't they go back and kill it like in live runs?
[3:05:29] moderatygos: we'll run dungeons starting 10 am pacific tomorrow and sunday
[3:05:47] moderatygos: @Culver42 they can go back and finish, but its most of the time too much time added to the run
[3:05:49] Almanes: not with Fenrir in HoV .. if you have agro on him as a tank, he will just teleport you to him LUL
[3:05:51] EzzLyfe: @Culver42 they can and do

[3:06:30] lmnop_mnb: buff unholy dk more
[3:07:03] tiltedgaming_ttv: @godfather188 Unholy is fine in live keys, as you dont pull half the dungeon in one go.. their dmg scales with more mobs

[3:07:50] AloftPanda: Was that thundering?
[3:07:55] Emerno: @godfather188 sounds like they need more harsh aoe caps then
[3:07:58] Maxheadspace: Legendary wipe

[3:08:18] Winnnie: @Sk1f3r i believe twitch only goes to 1080?
[3:08:24] tiltedgaming_ttv: @EzzLyfe yeah of course they are good, they are in bis gear with the correct buffs and such used at the right times
[3:08:33] Mokkun: It's so weird having mained feral since Legion, seeing them actually be desired in M+.
[3:08:51] imjoyybtw: @Sk1f3r some streamers can get 1440p i think
