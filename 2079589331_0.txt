[1:56:59] Spanky042: that's 200 dps on everything that doesn't stand away from it
[1:57:01] AgentIce99: overheat also makes the dragon do 25% more dmg
[1:57:52] Spanky042: I think overheat makes it TAKE 25% more dmg
[1:58:06] Dassrullen: ^
[1:58:08] Spanky042: not do more
[1:58:14] Byggareebob: Is trinket or ring from STV event better
[1:58:23] Cereal_Killa: he takes 25% more and does an AOE that doesnt add a dot
[1:58:28] Shreddingly: And having 3 overheat is either a major loss on melee dps or intense healing check. Having 1 is a breeze. I think they also take slightly more damage so we usually pull whelp close to sheep
[1:59:17] Cereal_Killa: @StaysafeTV i think it will be interesting to see if felguard is a rune at 50 though cause that could make a difference for going demo
[1:59:17] Dassrullen: nono overheat is fine, cluck is what's scary, and reflect obviously
[1:59:56] cyonara74: mages need more buffs
[2:00:10] Grimdotter: felguard benefits from all demon talents it says
[2:00:13] Cereal_Killa: yea they would make changes to the talent trees like they already have done
[2:00:42] Mtruck27: if they do felguard, and you get ashbringer....does the felguard hold it??

[2:26:46] clockworkillithid: How do you feel about the XP changes tuesday Staysafe? I quit SOD over it, if the game is easy and everything is handed to me. I feel no connection to the world and no enjoyment from playing. Am I in the minority?

[2:31:20] clockworkillithid: @Yarith 100%, At max level they will introduce token. Argument will go "We tried to stop RMT and ban people but it didnt work" when in reality the Token incentivizes bots because of gold inflation. Theres 0% Chance they don't add it P4. Wrath proved that IMO
