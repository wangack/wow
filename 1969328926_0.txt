[0:05:26] Effin_Steffin: towLets towGo
[0:05:35] 91Niki: towHi towSip
[0:06:01] krypkicks: all i wanted was a dam roadmap all i got was a 7 year story expansion
[0:06:34] Nehcrom: Anyone else got the hype going after the panels, info being release etc? Wow is going to be even more lit.
[0:06:48] mackieeswe: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[0:06:55] HeyItsForza: this should be an interesting episode of Towelliee
[0:07:04] mavericks312: that ion panel got me super hyped
[0:07:04] atsq1: Was there anything on DF if they’ll do anything beyond a 3rd season?
[0:07:05] Odinslayer: morning peeps!
[0:07:07] DunzoCD: Morning all towHi
[0:07:09] Odinslayer: lets GO!
[0:07:20] Brodih_: morning dudes
[0:07:31] Brodih_: and ladies!
[0:07:32] mavericks312: @atsq1 more story focused patches till 11.0 an probably a fated season
[0:07:44] Effin_Steffin: Warbands towLets towGo towNut3
[0:08:10] Zivs: what a crazy 2 days it's been
[0:08:12] Nehcrom: Even 10.2 looking interesting :)
[0:08:14] krypkicks: @mavericks312 they didnt say anything about a fated season
[0:08:16] atsq1: @mavericks312 was that in a panel? I missed it
[0:08:34] Nehcrom: The crowd reaction when Metzen entered the scene :D
[0:08:42] dwsunshine: !lurk  dwsunsLove  dwsunsLove  dwsunsLove
[0:08:43] krypkicks: all they said was this is the last raid of this expansion
[0:09:04] Brodih_: what are Warbands? pleb here, missed it...
[0:09:23] MrGattz: basically account wide everything
[0:09:23] mavericks312: @krypkicks true but they also didnt really specify on DF much other then more story
[0:09:25] MoodyVanessa: @krypkicks last raid doesnt mean there can't be a fated season
[0:09:30] Sereannon: Shared alts - bank, rep
[0:09:33] Silverwards: @Brodih_ account wide everything, new UI stuff to better communicate it
[0:09:35] Armdel: not sure exactly how it works, but basically more stuff account shared
[0:09:37] rxsunshatter: @krypkicks there was an interview with Ian and he confirmed fated season for DF
[0:10:01] krypkicks: @rxsunshatter link for proof?
[0:10:07] Armdel: pretty cool to have a shared bank between your own characters
[0:10:16] rxsunshatter: @krypkicks sure one sec
[0:10:18] Nehcrom: Loved Ion's shirt as well, laughed greatly at that.
[0:10:33] Brodih_: @Tai_Silverward oh thats cool, thanks
[0:10:37] Nehcrom: That t-shirt is going to sell like hot cakes :D
[0:10:40] Silverwards: i want Ion's shirt from yesterday
[0:11:31] Collected1: the account wide stuff is probably the biggest win since vanilla
[0:12:19] MoodyVanessa: i just want 10.2.5 for the dynamic flying everywhere
[0:12:33] Collected1: all thats missing is an account wide "paragon level" system
[0:12:44] Silverwards: aren't we also getting lobal Dragonriding in 10.2.5? Was that a cheeky mention from yesterday's panel?
[0:12:50] jumbobananasplit: man, the worst part of getting old is how hairy your feet become Sadge
[0:13:07] MoodyVanessa: @Collected1 like diablo?
[0:13:18] MoodyVanessa: @Tai_Silverward yes, we are
[0:13:18] lithium364: i love the vault changes for world content, finally i can skip m+ and raids full time
[0:13:55] LehBiscuit: LFR Chad and Delves PogChamp
[0:14:31] LehBiscuit: which is fine to me as mythic + and raids give me anxiety LUL
[0:14:48] PotbellyGoat: towHAMUP
[0:15:17] ParzivalMcfly17: Hero talents are the shit. Deeper class fantasy? I’m all in baby!
[0:15:49] Collected1: we just need class quests now

[0:15:59] krypkicks: @LehBiscuit surely that gear wont be on the same level as mythic + or raid gear
[0:16:04] LehBiscuit: just excited to only have to run old raids on one character for transmogs finally
[0:16:14] geokouts: so in new expantion i could get totier gear JUST from World content?
[0:16:20] LehBiscuit: @krypkicks they said it can be abut mythidc + 10-15 and heroic level gear
[0:16:46] LehBiscuit: but obviously that can change or w/e
[0:16:46] Brodih_: I wonder if Sloot will crack and decide to come back to WoW already
[0:16:51] src1923: yea the max ilvl reward from world tier would be like last heroic boss
[0:17:22] LehBiscuit: which even if its that still awesome for casual play
[0:17:35] ParzivalMcfly17: @collected1 no doubt. Class specific quests would be the icing on the cake. I’m sure we’ll see then return at some point
[0:17:36] FryeTV: @Brodih_ ofc he will.
[0:17:42] LehBiscuit: fine leaving mythic level gear to myhthic, makes sense
[0:18:17] krypkicks: that makes sense on the gear i mean just after 1 month heroic and mythic + is puggable
[0:18:28] Collected1: as a solo player I finally get to use the vault!
[0:18:29] Moobot: THE new wireless Scimitar and Virtuoso Pro Open Back Headset now available! towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee
[0:18:40] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @rxsunshatter (warning)
[0:18:45] Silverwards: as a solo casual andy, wanting Mythic level gear without doing Mythic content is insane. Heroic is perfect
[0:18:49] mavericks312: @Collected1 did you not LFR?
[0:19:05] lithium364: im sure that delve seasonal mount is already better then the keystone one haha
[0:19:13] rxsunshatter: @krypkicks i whispered you the link
[0:19:23] src1923: i was always a solo player but still manage to pug +20 and aotc, it will be even easier now.
[0:19:40] HeyItsForza: @Tai_Silverward i agree.   im not a raider....i like leveling and doing solo things.
[0:20:45] ParzivalMcfly17: @tai_silverward from what I’ve seen over the years too mythic level gear, from an “aesthetic point,” doesn’t exactly warrant the kind of effort to get it. I wish they’d would be mythic specific sets that have a whole different design Separate from the other modes.
[0:20:55] krypkicks: @rxsunshatter i see it thank u
[0:21:16] rxsunshatter: @krypkicks np sorry it took me a second to find!
[0:21:42] Collected1: @mavericks312 Nah not for a while.
[0:22:28] lithium364: maybe they wont even do fated, because everyone is gonna play beta anyway with the epic edition kekw, theyre plan all along
[0:22:44] rxsunshatter: fated is confirmed
[0:22:51] rxsunshatter: interview with ian with icy veins
[0:22:53] Silverwards: i'd love to see Fated, it was a good idea
[0:23:06] krypkicks: @lithium364 beta wont exist until summer of 2024
[0:23:18] MOLAR305: MOLAR305 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! towLets towGo towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[0:23:34] Collected1: nah beta Spring imho
[0:23:40] Collected1: alpha will be super short
[0:23:56] krypkicks: alpha is sping
[0:24:25] Collected1: both can happen in the same season
[0:24:30] jason_tacey: didn't they say alpha was gonna be starting first couple months of 2024? but that new BG they want to test super early and maybe have some skirmishes with the map, iirc
[0:24:32] Collected1: alpha is just a content creator preview at this point
[0:25:10] mavericks312: beta most likely is late april early may if i had to guess
[0:25:21] rxsunshatter: not really anymore, alpha and beta is where there making most of their class changes now adays especially gonna need it with those hero points.
[0:25:49] Collected1: mavericks312 : yup then late summer release
[0:25:54] mavericks312: but remember they were alot further along with DF then we thought when the beta dropped so who  knows
[0:26:01] Collected1: i think they'll surprise everyone with how quickly it comes along
[0:26:14] krypkicks: 2-2.5 months of alpha i dont think so?
[0:26:16] mavericks312: @Collected1 id say its probably a late september early october release
[0:26:29] Collected1: all of the screenshots yesterday looked done

[0:26:44] ashwing_: With the amount of people that will get Beta due to the Epic edition, they would probably pump it out real quick
[0:26:56] chabouy: they said and shhowed fall of 2024
[0:27:59] sparks_support: sparks_support subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[0:28:10] krypkicks: i would say oct at the very earliest for expansion release
[0:28:29] rxsunshatter: i mean think about it.. we got what 6-8 weeks with 10.2, then 10.2.5 for 6 weeks, then 6-8 weeks of fated and thats when they will probably drop beta or alpha
[0:29:06] mavericks312: i think we get alpha late feb early march

[0:31:08] Veegore: @Odinslayer it won't be, they already said it's not the last patch just the last raid. so there will be a s4 like SL with fated raids most likely
[0:31:13] Collected1: they went from alpha to release in 4 months with DF.
[0:31:40] Collected1: so Alpha Feb/Mar .. release July/Aug
[0:31:47] LehBiscuit: yeah there will be a 10.2.5 and the fated raid season and anything else they ddcide to do
[0:32:03] rxsunshatter: pre patch too
[0:32:26] Collected1: yup pre-patch will be huge with all the cross account stuff etc
[0:32:49] LehBiscuit: people gonna be running a lot of old raids for mogs
[0:32:55] rxsunshatter: thats realistically when we will get all the stuff we really want anyways
[0:32:58] clazuls: @Veegore they said fall 2024 for the next xpac
[0:33:12] Collected1: when did they say fall?
[0:33:25] rxsunshatter: it was on the big panel
[0:33:31] LehBiscuit: fall extends all the way to to like December 22nd so that is still a poor indication of time frame

[0:34:14] garymustang: @lehbiscuit 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[0:34:30] Nebulizer87: they said ~march for alpha testing i believe
[0:34:40] skillet_twitch: !uptime
[0:34:45] DunzoCD: i would guess Oct/Nov
[0:34:56] ahies28: !soon
[0:34:56] Moobot: @ahies28 it usually takes ~45 mins after going live to start. its been 35:01 since he went live. grab some snacks or go do something, the stream will start soon™
[0:35:16] Collected1: Oh yeah. I didn't spot that.
[0:35:23] emznev: Wish they announced classic shadowlands BibleThump NotLikeThis
[0:35:39] LehBiscuit: Any SoD enjoyers in chat today?
[0:35:40] krypkicks: Fall is from the end of September to the end of December
[0:35:42] Collected1: so September then I guess
[0:35:53] PlagueHit: @emznev Kappa
[0:36:11] emznev: Kappa
[0:36:17] Collected1: they could still bring it forward. perhaps fall is just a safety net.
[0:36:17] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[0:36:34] Collected1: under promise, over deliver etc
[0:37:00] krypkicks: true
[0:37:19] Sereannon: Fine print on the preorder page says "by Dec 31 2024"
[0:37:23] MoodyVanessa: @Collected1 maybe... but i think the expansion could be October with a S4 in May and prepatch in August/September
[0:38:15] LehBiscuit: @Sereannon thats just legal print. have to put at least that there
[0:38:38] Khalostaran: hi
[0:38:40] skymercii: Think we getting another fated season? fangzJam
[0:38:52] LehBiscuit: we wil be yes
[0:38:58] PlagueHit: It can be sooner right? There is a long time until december
[0:39:04] MoodyVanessa: yes
[0:39:20] mavericks312: @PlagueHit define sooner?
[0:39:38] Zettabyte: G'mornin' towHAMUP
[0:39:38] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[0:39:39] MoodyVanessa: sooner as in the expansion launch or what
[0:39:40] krypkicks: well its a 8 week content release right?
[0:39:40] PlagueHit: August Kappa
[0:39:54] mavericks312: like the earliest i think we get it is late september
[0:40:01] Sollice: Morning
[0:40:19] rxsunshatter: 6-8 weeks is what they aim for for patches i think
[0:40:20] mavericks312: whats up sollice
[0:40:24] PlagueHit: Yea september is a fine deal for me
[0:40:34] HeyItsForza: did he fall back to sleep?
[0:40:34] PlagueHit: Morning
[0:40:36] mavericks312: 6-8 is the patch cadence
[0:40:47] krypkicks: so 10.2.5 is like in Jan then  S4 like in March
[0:40:47] skymercii: @sollice fangzHi
[0:41:04] mezza77: october 8th is my guess
[0:41:07] rxsunshatter: that seems right to me
[0:41:22] szble: least we got dawntrail for summer
[0:41:29] rxsunshatter: then may-june for pre patch
[0:41:31] swervity82: swervity82 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 51 months! 
[0:41:31] strike879: march will be 10.2.7
[0:41:33] skymercii: I think it was amazing that Chris metzen got a standing ovation
[0:41:34] mavericks312: 10.2.5 is most likely january and 10.2.7 is most likely march
[0:41:37] mmrghost7: i havent played since 10.0 are there anything new for minig and herbalism to farm in 10.2 ?
[0:41:40] MoodyVanessa: @krypkicks i don't think it will be like that each Season has lasted 6 months and i think they will do like Shadowlands with the S4 lasting 4 months and launching 2 months after the .2.7 release
[0:42:06] pathebaker: April may gonna be prepatch with release in June right

[0:42:09] mavericks312: @WildRaellie season yes not patches though
[0:42:18] rxsunshatter: that could work too, fated season is confirmed so it could be similar
[0:42:40] mavericks312: @pathebaker no lol beta will still be going on in june
[0:42:45] rxsunshatter: heres to hoping this fated season gets a little more content that just raids and mythics though
[0:42:46] SpoofAvatar: Fall 2024, 1 year away
[0:42:54] MoodyVanessa: @mavericks312 huh? i'd say Jan .2.5, March .2.7, May S4
[0:43:01] tumtillion: Good morning all
[0:43:27] mavericks312: @WildRaellie also just cause were getting another fated season that doesnt mean its s4
[0:43:50] mmrghost7: are there any changes to herbalism and minig in 10.2 ?
[0:43:56] mavericks312: @WildRaellie 10.2.7 could just add all the fated stuff in that rather then worrying about a 10.3
[0:43:57] Sereannon: Fated = Season 4
[0:43:57] doomester: 4:49pm here
[0:44:02] pathebaker: @mavericks312 no way. That would mean this patch would go longer than 6 months?
[0:44:09] krypkicks: @mavericks312 ion directly says Season 4
[0:44:17] cabalish: towLets towGo towTnn towLove
[0:44:23] rxsunshatter: he does say season 4
[0:44:23] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[0:44:28] MoodyVanessa: @mavericks312 in SL fated was S4
[0:44:30] strike879: you can normal fly again so thats a change to mining herbing
[0:44:48] mavericks312: @krypkicks yes but when you say s4 players start to think another m+ season and another raid which isnt happening
[0:45:05] rxsunshatter: it is though..
[0:45:13] rxsunshatter: it will be fated raid and a new season
[0:45:13] mavericks312: @pathebaker you have 10.2.5 and 10.2.7 along with the fated season
[0:45:19] rxsunshatter: for M+ and pvp

[1:00:35] Line_0: 4 zone pics were obviously fake
[1:00:44] zelours: 1 every year instead of 2? As they're calling it a saga?
[1:00:48] Blistz1: 3 expansions is wildd. wayy better than 1
[1:00:56] Effin_Steffin: Suck It Dataminers!
[1:00:58] Metket: @Towelliee what did they do to keep this as a secret this time for a long time?

[1:01:07] rosina_scarlett: were going to start in the middle of Azeroth and end up at the other side of Azeroth
[1:01:09] Blistz1: I was shocked. I didn't expect a expansion to be annouced this year too ahahha

[1:01:16] just_laxus: every 18 month or so
[1:01:20] FutileDiploma: Can I get the tldr for WoW at and classic as blizz con or a video you have of it

[1:01:26] DeanoTV: @Towelliee the expacs did get leaked, want the link?

[1:01:29] Greencaps07: i think it would be still 2 year but we actually get content every 8 week or whatever
[1:01:29] NovaNax: @Towelliee wow head says the sage is gona end at 2030
[1:01:31] ronny_84: they said no 10.3 but wondering if that means no fated season? any thoughts?
[1:01:32] FreshgamingQ: don`t think it`s faster, they also said they have content for the next 20 years
[1:01:33] dracullus: it's faster from Metzen perspective when expacs had 1 year drought LUL
[1:01:46] geokouts: 2030 expantion maybe the last expantion?
[1:01:47] vitloggg: would you reccomd playing now, i quited after before DF
[1:01:49] Greencaps07: so the story can actually be built
[1:01:49] BoezIRL: shorter end time

[1:02:32] CipansR_Ayaya: must collect pins
[1:02:36] exiousgb: You have Rumble on PC? How?!
[1:02:40] NovaNax: @ijuki yup forgot a few words

[1:02:47] mavericks312: @Line_0 i do think after this saga they will do a soft reboot
[1:02:55] kalamari__: everything wow saved the con
[1:02:59] BoezIRL: starcraft
[1:03:02] szble: wonder why ow LUL
[1:03:02] geokouts: they should have made an 3 expantion boundle for 250 :P
[1:03:03] ijuki: @NovaNax All cool SeemsGood
[1:03:07] ashwing_: OW tries too hard too late and they made a mistake with the PvE cancellation
[1:03:09] akia03: @Towelliee  anything about the new surv game?
[1:03:09] Collected1: that "what about star craft" guy LUL
[1:03:10] king_julian_96: when is alpha for war within
[1:03:13] Jkob_Jkob: WoW had best presentation imo, Metzen and Ion killed it both days
[1:03:14] kyshen3: Yea i felt like D4's panel was very on the light side of content.
[1:03:16] just_laxus: i was even freaking out at home when i saw him
[1:03:18] CipansR_Ayaya: LUL
[1:03:22] kyshen3: Ion had the best panel though, so good.
[1:03:22] MMokuin: Wow next logos are more destroyed until last one. Moved sidewayse and look like mechanic "clock"
[1:03:24] cptrogers123: Metzen is iconic
[1:03:25] REALPolarbeezy: Chris 3:16
[1:03:25] Line_0: @mavericks312 I mean either way the point is that's not the end like some people say
[1:03:28] Lith0n: was the only game with real hype
[1:03:28] jerseyfive: overwatch let me hear you! one lonely guy clapping woohoo
[1:03:29] ItsDerpDiggler: Then he gave a Stone Cold speech lol
[1:03:32] PvtHudson093: "Daddies Home" Metzan walks out
[1:03:33] Jkob_Jkob: Overwatch was so UNDERWHELMING, the worst of all
[1:03:39] exiousgb: How do you get Rumble on PC??

[1:03:53] Sarocus: I really like the mount we got
[1:03:53] mavericks312: @Line_0 oh hell no im just saying it could be there chance for a soft reboot
[1:03:54] king_julian_96: what version did you order toweliee
[1:03:54] cabalish: @Towelliee get the cata preorder too, with mount pet and more
[1:03:54] Collected1: March Alpha doesn't fit with Fall unless they're going to take more than 4 months this time
[1:03:57] Rhiinehart: the mount is really nice
[1:03:57] kyotoboss: yes , mount , transmog , tendis
[1:03:58] DunzoCD: the new mount is cool
[1:03:58] PigPenLen: they gave warcraft the time it deserved finally, even with the stupidity around OW2
[1:04:03] deaddwarfwalking: the in game rewards are awesome
[1:04:03] 91Niki: The war within pre order stuff is in there. The Cata pre order is not yet
[1:04:04] byrdeen45: the mounts great
[1:04:10] Sarocus: Dragonriding gryphon ftw
[1:04:12] cabalish: warcraft dropdown menu
[1:04:13] fumennen: @Towelliee the set has an advance to it
[1:04:13] BlueBlurPrime: was suprsied about the 3 day early access part, first tiem I have seen that
[1:04:14] r_Wazze: 3 days prelaunch everyone will get the 90$
[1:04:14] Thirdheaven: Anyone know where to get his desktop backround?
[1:04:15] まっと: cata is under the wrath tab
[1:04:20] elirank9: worked for d4
[1:04:22] strike879: only after ppl complained i found out it has 3 day early acces
[1:04:23] Sambhur: You'll need to get the tenders from the chest
[1:04:29] ragnacorelol: Where did you get that wallpaper at?
[1:04:34] Collected1: what does the "Limited Time Only" mean
[1:04:50] dracullus: @Towelliee what would happen if someone buy it on another account? I hope they wouldn't give more tendies for that?
[1:04:55] Line_0: I think the 3 days early will be fine if they shut off the ah
[1:04:55] rosina_scarlett: go to show then scroll down and you should see Cata
[1:04:59] Niksen_99: I felt bad for the girl presenting WoW Classic... Nobody was cheering in the crowd lol
[1:05:00] cptrogers123: The future is looking good for wow
[1:05:03] Thorian92: 3 days earlier is a bullshit sorry but it is
[1:05:05] Herzenliegen: @r_wazze I won't be
[1:05:06] mavericks312: yea the 3 day early stuff has sent the ragers off the edge lol
[1:05:09] Shrenko: @ragnacorelol its from Wallpaper engine on Steam
[1:05:13] Sarocus: Can't preorder after launch
[1:05:14] king_julian_96: so i take it you got the epic editon toweliee
[1:05:17] bierarnoo: 3 day early acces sucks.
[1:05:18] gassygatinho: Kungen fanboys alread calling season of discovery classic minus
[1:05:29] Collected1: the 3 days is super unfortunate imho
[1:05:29] mavericks312: @Thorian92 i mean every game is doing it now
[1:05:37] ijuki: @gassygatinho lal, funny
[1:05:39] cabalish: no more downtime confirmed ?
[1:05:40] Djfarmville: Unless profs are locked off during the 3 days early access alot of people will feel forced to get it i think
[1:05:40] king_julian_96: yeah sucks for non epic edition holders
[1:05:44] spainard15: With them announcing three expansions that gives them lots of time to work on something great in next few years maybe like a wow2?
[1:05:46] PvtHudson093: will be out before 31/12/24
[1:05:48] Rooseweld: @gassygatinho  because it is
[1:05:48] Camelbak21: Gatherers, farmers
[1:05:49] KrimsonElite: Assuming it means limited time only for the beta since betas are technically limited time probably just legal jargon
[1:05:49] belfastcl: only the people trying to make tons of gold early launch
[1:05:52] ragnacorelol: @Shrenko Thank you!
[1:05:52] Line_0: Only ah, nothing else
[1:05:55] DunzoCD: the early access should maybe be in the $70 pack tbh
[1:05:55] akia03: gold farmers
[1:05:57] fewyn: how much of the early access servers will be broken
[1:05:58] vitloggg: its just because its weekend
[1:05:58] kokochris: Warband idea sounds cool
[1:05:59] Effin_Steffin: people are gonna be level capped ib those 3 days
[1:06:00] holst23: Its pretty much the standard in game nowadays to give early access
[1:06:03] strike879: if it was not the 3 days it wouldve been something els those ragers live for being angry
[1:06:05] lighirr: gold farmers
[1:06:05] just_laxus: it really only effects world first people for leveling and stuff
[1:06:05] r_Wazze: i think maybe this help server stress at launch
[1:06:08] Dkgungo: im a filthy casual so it dont effect me at all
[1:06:09] KinggKebab: They already said end game features are locked for early access
[1:06:11] dracullus: it sucks because launch was always community event when everyone waited together
[1:06:12] mavericks312: you will just get pre m+ ready thats all
[1:06:13] Goodnevi1: profession head start is the only thing i can think of
[1:06:13] FryeTV: is there gunna be a collector's edition?
[1:06:17] kyotoboss: look how many people are playing rumble in your FL , thats impressive
[1:06:19] src1923: They say mythic dungeons and weekly quests will not be avaiable for the early acces
[1:06:19] Dragali: @Towelliee  Working Crowd perhapbs. If Launch is on Reset Day. They can play on the Weekend before
[1:06:23] Heartic07: I mean it basically forces you to buy epic edition
[1:06:27] Theduskflyer: Towelliee, its just something people will bitch about. the same people would bitch that you gave them a million dollars but its in 20s not 50s.
[1:06:28] BoezIRL: gold making
[1:06:28] rbolude: im happy the base edition is only 50 bucks lol
[1:06:30] EpicJune: i think just starting all on the same day is fun, but it will help ques maybe
[1:06:37] LoGoshXCIII: 3 days is nothing no raid no mythic....
[1:06:37] brozzy: kinda fucks the auction house for casuals but its what it is
[1:06:38] DunzoCD: DF was 99
[1:06:38] king_julian_96: they allready said in that time you won't be able to do world quests or mythic 0's in that 3 day early access
[1:06:39] Line_0: Same prices
[1:06:40] MoodyVanessa: yeah same prices
[1:06:41] Blackhaxx: dont give em ideas LUL
[1:06:42] Ryuenjin: Yeah, same prices as DF
[1:06:42] s7wede: This is probably the most hyped I have ever been for an expansion. As somebody that has had to slow down the more hardcore grind due to health, the solo content in WW is such a vibe for me
[1:06:47] mezza77: give me the collector's edition!! lol
[1:06:48] kyotoboss: yes same price
[1:06:48] Syrc0: @Towelliee DF Epic did also cost 99€
[1:06:58] PigPenLen: I would've paid that much for the damn dynmaic mount by itself tbh
[1:07:00] Collected1: it's purely commercial greed
[1:07:02] FreshieFresh: it's a cash grab, plain and simple
[1:07:02] DaLawII: df was 99 for me
[1:07:09] gassygatinho: Kind of ruins the whole 'it was the night before [insert expansiom]'
[1:07:11] just_laxus: the cataclysm upgrade mount is pretty awesome
[1:07:13] geokouts: the 3 days sure pissed alot of people
[1:07:14] KinggKebab: But it makes no difference with end game features being locked
[1:07:15] nickyptheg: It matters a lot for gold making is my guess, if you are a profession gold making enjoyer
[1:07:16] Shrenko: you also get a mount in retail for pre-ordering the Cataclysm version
[1:07:18] Hedrins: Where did you get that background?
[1:07:19] holst23: The Cata mount is neat
[1:07:27] rosina_scarlett: @Towelliee if you go to the shop then the side and click wow classic you can see the cata pre order
[1:07:28] mavericks312: @FreshieFresh whats your point name a dev company not doing this now
[1:07:33] opidlx: unpopular opinion but wow releases hit different i will always buy the sickest edition.
[1:07:34] FreshieFresh: $$$$
[1:07:34] DunzoCD: the customizations for the stormrider mount are pretty dope
[1:07:35] kalamari__: @Theduskflyer no, its not. release day together with *everyone* is one of the most hype things every for  expansion
[1:07:40] Velha_Senhora: we didint get any news on subs changes right?
[1:07:42] shortyforthewin: but you need the dragon too buy the new expansion or
[1:07:42] shale93: reason is ti create moro FOMO
[1:07:43] Pharaoh_326: isnt early access a microsoft thing? @Towelliee
[1:07:44] Charmmie: any idea what the "enhanced character boost" is ? whats enhanced.. just that its 70 not 60?#
[1:07:44] ashwing_: people on forums going meltdown for these 3 days LUL
[1:07:47] MoodyVanessa: 70 boost also gives 424 gear
[1:07:49] akia03: microsoft smells money
[1:07:50] BoezIRL: classic upgrade is in the shop at least in EU
[1:07:51] newwayz92: Any thoughs on updating your UI ?
[1:07:51] NickyNiclas: Maybe to get less pressure on the servers on launch day?
[1:07:51] wdotk: @Towelliee  did you get to talk (1 on 1 ) with ion or any of blizzard's big boys ?
[1:07:53] rosina_scarlett: level 70 boosts get 424 gear
[1:07:54] Day_Walker78: DF was  $89.99 on relase
[1:07:55] EpicJune: tbh should be if you pre order any editions of the game
[1:07:55] rufemannen: tHE 70 BOOST GIVES YOU 20 RENOWN WITHT HE FACTIONS
[1:08:00] Blackhaxx: i wonder is pre event is in old world now
[1:08:01] MoodyVanessa: yup lol
[1:08:01] rxsunshatter: yep
[1:08:01] rosina_scarlett: Yes
[1:08:02] fewyn: yep
[1:08:03] SphinxyOCE: yeah
[1:08:04] rxsunshatter: but cant get tier
[1:08:06] Collected1: shortyforthewin : current expansion gives you all previous stuff
[1:08:07] Line_0: Oh nice
[1:08:08] SisterblissUK: @akia03 4Head
[1:08:09] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[1:08:09] ijuki: WHAT?! 424?
[1:08:11] visaeris412: 20 to all renown except niffen which is 12
[1:08:12] Whammostar: yep
[1:08:15] kyotoboss: but you cant make it into tier
[1:08:16] SaiyanKent: @Towelliee 424 and 20 for all faction rep
[1:08:16] Wammus: I think it was meant to be for 10.2
[1:08:17] bierarnoo: yep
[1:08:17] Veegore: 424 gear and level 20 renown i think?
[1:08:19] Tw1tchyy: Yee lol, this new prot pally is nuts
[1:08:22] Sarocus: Higher than my main :p
[1:08:24] luckfore: its an "enhanced" boost
[1:08:24] FreshieFresh: @mavericks312 point is people should stop buying it, but I know that won't happen. It's scummy for them to do.
[1:08:24] ijuki: You are serious now chat?
[1:08:25] visaeris412: items arent upgradeable though
[1:08:27] MoodyVanessa: that is the quest for the new mount special races
[1:08:27] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[1:08:28] Whammostar: for the mount
[1:08:28] Djfarmville: Adjusted for 10.2 gear
[1:08:30] rosina_scarlett: all renown goes to 20 as well but niffen
[1:08:31] BoezIRL: welp daycare
[1:08:34] Ragnaros_Lothbrok: for mount i think
[1:08:35] fathertoast1: fathertoast1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hammers UP!
[1:08:40] 91Niki: I don't think the 3 day early access is per say a bad thing. Might help the servers not get slammed as hard. Only thing it might hurt is for some people to catch up economy wise. They won't get the chance to get in on the market when it's the highest
[1:08:40] laaxxxd: It's true
[1:08:43] WSilverHawkW: That quest is for preorder transmog
[1:08:45] Tw1tchyy: Well Niffen is level 12
[1:08:46] SaiyanKent: 100% the truth sir lol I was just as shocked
[1:08:46] Born2Die343: @Towelliee Good Morning! How was Blizzcon?
[1:08:47] shadowtalya: and 12 for Niffen
[1:08:47] mavericks312: @FreshieFresh yea thats not gonna happen
[1:08:48] king_julian_96: iam not complaining about hte 3 days early access gives me a head start over none epic edition holders
[1:08:48] overlyintelligent: They said "raid ready" char boost, so that fits

[1:18:21] whoislarsus: do we get s4 or s3 will be the last one?

[1:24:42] mavericks312: W's all around you love to see it
[1:24:46] Trafikk_: you cant make the boosted gear Tier
[1:24:46] Djfarmville: for 10.2 its not that high ilvl
[1:24:48] deaddwarfwalking: it is from a little dragon following you around
[1:24:49] aaronboxedya: !following
[1:24:53] Larc9783: They really want to eliminate any pain point from people they pulled back in from blizzcon
[1:24:55] Shrenko: Im most excited for accountwide Achievement progress, I can finally play my alts....
[1:24:56] randsam2002: the next patch gear is 440+ sooo its kinda usless
[1:24:59] Aceblace: for someone who didnt play DF, how far does it get you? The itemlevel
[1:25:13] jargoo: That boost give to renown max or 20 ?
[1:25:17] DeanoTV: @Shrenko same POGGERS
[1:25:18] Ziddrax: 424 from boost?
[1:25:18] SamuraiWillZ916: collect the stuff from each faction
[1:25:20] kyotoboss: yes and a reagent bag
[1:25:23] まっと: finally feels like its worth the money. felt like a scam before since leveling is so fast nowadays
[1:25:23] zorantt: Heard the boost is based off of 10.2 gear
[1:25:24] Forlagon: its only proper ilvl for like 3 days
[1:25:27] r_Wazze: because that ruins all 424 crafteds.
[1:25:28] Rhiinehart: its a pretty good boost
[1:25:29] funviking99: 424 which is normal raid item level
[1:25:30] Line_0: @aceblace with a few upgrades you'll be ready for normal raid next patch
[1:25:30] WSilverHawkW: @jargoo 20
[1:25:31] poorhooligans: what level keys can you run at 424?
[1:25:33] matthewkshearer: Can you turn the gear to tier?
[1:25:38] shale93: question is can you convert the 424 gear to tier set?
[1:25:38] Krazeera: @Towelliee Every time I come back and watch you, you look thinner. Good job on the weight loss man!
[1:25:39] Nethil: they missed opportunity to give 420.69 ilvl
[1:25:41] Faregon: @poorhooligans +15
[1:25:47] Theduskflyer: like 30k gold too
[1:25:50] king_julian_96: 424 is low for 10.2 though toweliee
[1:25:51] cripplious: @Towelliee does it also boost your dragonriding?
[1:25:53] poorhooligans: wow
[1:25:59] swervity82: Can you turn your gear into Tier?
[1:26:00] Ziddrax: maybe you should've boosted when the next patch was out
[1:26:01] onous_: @randsam2002 useless? Lol of course there'd be some scrub like you complaining about them boosting you to a manageable ilvl.
[1:26:04] Shrenko: any crests ?
[1:26:06] Aceblace: @Line_0 that sounds fair for a 60 dollar boost, thanks :)
[1:26:08] Blugamma: How about dragon riding glyphs?
[1:26:13] matthewkshearer: Check if you can upgrade the gear to tier at the catalyst?
[1:26:15] Veegore: they should've added a mythic keystone in the survival bag lol
[1:26:21] s7wede: it's very low even for LFR. LFR drops 441
[1:26:22] Metket: @Blugamma those are acc wide
[1:26:26] Armdel: you're supposed to be able to start the latest patch, not be geared immediately
[1:26:30] instant_savage: u can spit on urself and be 435
[1:26:34] SphinxyOCE: nah you can't
[1:26:35] Line_0: You cant
[1:26:36] Rhiinehart: you cant catalyst it
[1:26:37] Melgor101: SMOrc PopCorn
[1:26:40] sadgersqq: cant catalyst into tier
[1:26:41] fcwar_: You cant
[1:26:41] Line_0: It won't turn into tier
[1:26:42] Ryuenjin: No, you can't
[1:26:42] mavericks312: probably not
[1:26:52] Nemesis_: thats fair imo
[1:26:56] mavericks312: a brand new toon with 4 pc is way to broken
[1:26:57] SphinxyOCE: i was hoping to get 4 piece instantly LUL
[1:27:05] dracullus: yeah. buy 70 boosts for free sets xD
[1:27:05] 6all: overpowered to get tier for 1 week?
[1:27:05] Ryuenjin: It means you have to scramble to get tier
[1:27:20] brewsuadeshoes: Check the tmog
[1:27:20] kyotoboss: look at the t mog set
[1:27:22] herr_iceman: it's starter gear supposed to be replaced
[1:27:22] kyotoboss: :)
[1:27:28] mavericks312: can we talk about the massive W that is warbands
[1:27:36] lillithsbathwater: wow pay to win
[1:27:41] trakshun21: would you say now is a good time to get back into DF for a returning player?
[1:27:49] Metket: check in b.net?
[1:27:52] just_laxus: it's on the bnet homepage
[1:27:53] CaraxesNA: its 80 bucks to upgrade the classic edition
[1:27:54] s7wede: @Towelliee Do the quest you got from the little dragon. It gives you an upgraded transmog set. You don't even need to gold the races
[1:27:55] magemaster225: $30 for rag mount, $80 for 1 free boost
[1:27:56] DunzoCD: https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm-classic-upgrades
[1:27:58] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @rosina_scarlett (warning)
[1:27:58] Shrenko: the transmog set comes with a quest, when you finish it you get glowing lightning on your armor @Towelliee
[1:28:00] MoodyVanessa: 30 for heroic and 90 for epic
[1:28:04] mavericks312: @trakshun21 100%
[1:28:05] lillithsbathwater: pay to winnnn
[1:28:06] Line_0: I'm glad they do cata
[1:28:07] CipansR_Ayaya: cata retail classic
[1:28:10] PvtHudson093: Cata replaced the Wrath Epic edition on the store page
[1:28:11] 91Niki: I do not understand the price difference. It does NOT make sense
[1:28:14] Blistz1: I knew cataclysm will come out
[1:28:15] king_julian_96: so if alpha is early next year i am guessing beta will be mid next year aroudn the tiem season 3 ends probably
[1:28:19] CaraxesNA: i hate the price jump
[1:28:20] vaironixx: hey and people cant say you were wrong about the underground stuff too
[1:28:24] Nebulizer87: i would play classic but not paying 80 for a boost
[1:28:24] mavericks312: @lillithsbathwater stop it
[1:28:25] herr_iceman: idk about cata man
[1:28:30] Shrenko: jesus
[1:28:31] lillithsbathwater: trash
[1:28:32] DunzoCD: thats crazy
[1:28:32] Line_0: Weird
[1:28:34] dSaipher: We Skyrim now boys
[1:28:35] CipansR_Ayaya: so dumb
[1:28:36] Veegore: you get a Rag mount for retail woooo
[1:28:36] NickyNiclas: That's so odd
[1:28:38] SaiyanKent: yeah bought cata once, thats enough lmfao
[1:28:41] Ralandis: ...oh. ewuh.
[1:28:43] Larc9783: Bliz is going for all the marbles
[1:28:44] CipansR_Ayaya: they are just milking dumb people
[1:28:44] randsam2002: @onous_ chill dude you kinda high I meant for the next patch that you will change it instantly, the lowest gear over there is 440
[1:28:48] Collected1: maybe they forgot to add the early access to this one
[1:28:48] itsDets: that's what I was thinking
[1:28:51] Exilox: its the boost and gametime
[1:28:51] src1923: no reason to buy either though just play
[1:28:53] ThePawPaw: can i get my Worgen boosted to 80?
[1:28:54] Shrenko: you get a retail mount for the 30$ one
[1:28:58] Niksen_99: They made leveling faster for cata too so it really doesnt make sense this offer
[1:28:58] dranet11: you can pay a dude to level for you 1-80 for $10
[1:29:02] cipusanx: you have no reason to buy any of them at all
[1:29:03] Armdel: bobby going all out on his way out the door Kappa
[1:29:03] xhaven: what servers will cata be on the regular Wotlk servers?
[1:29:04] lillithsbathwater: blizzard trash
[1:29:04] CipansR_Ayaya: @radudk yep
[1:29:04] dracullus: maybe its was typo, but they decided to just go with it Kappa
[1:29:06] mavericks312: is that mount available for retail?
[1:29:09] Skyymarshal: would consider it for 50-59$
[1:29:11] WadeWilson: If I had saved boosts on my account, do they now become enhanced boosts?
[1:29:11] CodyDaBrodie: If it was $59 I’d be down haha
[1:29:12] mizerboy: And 3 days early access
[1:29:16] mizerboy: and beta access
[1:29:17] rosina_scarlett: @xhaven yes

[1:29:20] 91Niki: Not yet
[1:29:23] DunzoCD: if it was $50 id come back for cata

[1:29:24] Shrenko: but not out yet

[1:29:50] BoezIRL: you get the ragnaros mount in retail
[1:29:50] l0n3w0lf28: I think they done it because you can't get a character boost separately
[1:29:51] Riondrius: Has he already said his thoughts on the 3 day Early Acces for retail?
[1:29:54] Shrenko: its a mount for retail too but out after reset

[1:32:51] Boioioioing: you can just boost now in classic as well
[1:32:53] Theduskflyer: Classic sells a boost too, though
[1:32:54] dranet11: ions deep dive was just positive after positive
[1:32:56] Boioioioing: can boost any time
[1:33:03] Theduskflyer: classic wrath**
[1:33:18] r_Wazze: i paid $50 12 years ago for cata not doing that again.
[1:33:19] kalamari__: deep dive was 100% a win
[1:33:25] Veegore: it's account account wide
[1:33:26] Rhiinehart: theres loads of customisation for the new mount too
[1:33:27] Line_0: They already said its the whole account
[1:33:28] jenos01: i mean i paid 350 for the ff7 rebirth collectors edition its always subjective to the person if somthing is worth or not
[1:33:30] Line_0: No limit
[1:33:30] rxsunshatter: it is completely account wide
[1:33:31] rbolude: its true account wide
[1:33:31] Cafe0le: why do they iterate on torghast and islands instead of mage tower ?
[1:33:32] Trafikk_: all characters
[1:33:32] ashwing_: All characters on your account
[1:33:35] 6all: account wide, 4 characters just show on the screen
[1:33:35] Hommel88: warband is all you chars
[1:33:35] oktapus: They said that it's account account wide
[1:33:35] HerbieEregos: its account account wide
[1:33:37] CaraxesNA: would it be cheaper to buy the heroic version then the boost
[1:33:37] dranet11: all benefit but only 4 on the warband screen
[1:33:38] rxsunshatter: 4 people in a camp is just visual
[1:33:40] MikeyGy: all chars on bnet account
[1:33:41] Ziddrax: knowing blizz probably only 4
[1:33:41] BullDevil: It’s account wide
[1:33:42] Line_0: It was clarified already
[1:33:43] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[1:33:43] Veegore: there's a couple of interviews on wowhead that go into it, the screen for it will only show a few characters but all of them are in it
[1:33:43] Draahl: yeah finally alt-friendlier, ive been waiting for this since mop
[1:33:44] Collected1: i understood the 4 limit to just be the log in screen crowd
[1:33:44] Docta_G: Whole account, can just display limited char on char screen
[1:33:45] instant_savage: im assumong its 1 for each armor type
[1:33:46] magemaster225: wowiki interview is good, its almost all acct wide
[1:33:48] Syrc0: IT is account wide however on the screen it will only show 4 or something like that
[1:33:48] instant_savage: per account
[1:33:48] kaijoe_: Whole account. That screen is just who you want to see when you log in
[1:33:49] Necrom93: Season of Discovery has me hyped since it looks awesome it's so soon.
[1:33:51] MoodyVanessa: all characters are in the warband just 4 in the camp
[1:33:52] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I wonder if the collection side is retroactive.
[1:33:52] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: he said account wide and server wide so sounded like all alts will be listed from all servers
[1:33:53] mavericks312: the limit is for toons on the character select screen
[1:33:54] src1923: You will see characters from multiple servers on the same login screen too
[1:33:54] Arocian: sounded like all linked, the loading screen can just have 4 displayed
[1:33:54] Goodnevi1: Whole account, but you chose four for the load screen
[1:33:56] crittinkitten: They said it was 4 characters that are displayed but all characters accross all realms
[1:33:58] HerbieEregos: the Camp is just what you see on your screen so you can choose who to showcase etc
[1:34:01] 91Niki: It's everything! But the screen you see is just whichever characters you want there. So your favorites. Purely visual
[1:34:02] alextheory_: ''everything kinda''
[1:34:02] wildwittra: thinking of it from a technical point you, as a account owner, needs to add char to the warband
[1:34:03] BoezIRL: all the alts only 4 in the camp but it's only for visuals
[1:34:05] Line_0: No limit, only limit is characters shown on screen
[1:34:06] Sielu11628: The Algarian Stormrider is my favorite mount!
[1:34:08] wowbigs: It may only show your "TOP 4 favourites" however it applies to all characters account wide, Id imagine
[1:34:12] deaddwarfwalking: ion did say not to read into the screenshots
[1:34:12] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[1:34:15] Baldarsar: @Towelliee the always talk in riddles kinda, just say its all accountwide and good is
[1:34:18] Nasilvera: Has to be some restrictions it’s always restrictions
[1:34:19] Azukh: Ye they confirmed in an interview it's all characters on your account sharing the warband
[1:34:28] Vattss: races are fun!
[1:34:29] Mallaes: You just need to complete them
[1:34:29] CrunkyBrewster: morning tow welcome back
[1:34:31] mavericks312: tahts a no for me dawg lol
[1:34:31] Vattss: don't be racist!
[1:34:32] Vetere30: Vetere30 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:34:33] snarkydonald: put on that race face towChad
[1:34:33] Jarlan23: races are fun as hell
[1:34:33] 91Niki: @Towelliee all gold = a title :p
[1:34:35] Line_0: @baldarsar they did, its clarified
[1:34:36] Pharaoh_326: isnt that what you just got?
[1:34:38] Skobble: The 4 Characters on the Top the the ones around the fire. Imagine having all your million Alts around that fire. At least thats how I understood it
[1:34:43] funviking99: You don’t need gold btw just complete them
[1:34:44] src1923: races are free gold
[1:34:45] Mallaes: No need to go for silver and gold
[1:34:45] BlueBlurPrime: its easy though
[1:34:47] Shrenko: I love races
[1:34:56] WSilverHawkW: Races are for upgraded look
[1:34:56] CrunkyBrewster: LUL
[1:34:58] torchlight77: Why would you pay for an expansion you already own?
[1:34:59] Tyrolore: GOLD is NOT required for the transmog (only title)
[1:35:04] CrunkyBrewster: that is creative
[1:35:05] CaraxesNA: do you think this expansion was alt friendly for a casual player or more towards the hardcore players?
[1:35:05] Djfarmville: racing goggles?
[1:35:05] Baldarsar: @Line_0 i know , i mean how the say  its warbands i mean
[1:35:08] Nasilvera: Races are easy you use the storm mount
[1:35:16] cripplious: I thought Earthern were just clay dwarves
[1:35:22] QuigsTV: Gold does give you the title the storm racer
[1:35:23] alextheory_: have you gave your take about early accesss? @Towelliee
[1:35:24] mavericks312: the big dick donny cosplay was so good
[1:35:24] Melonbrew: Where did you get the quest @Towelliee
[1:35:27] notdustinx: heard the hilton popped off last night with a bunch of Marines LOOL
[1:35:30] Vattss: @Towelliee Races are fun, dont be racist!
[1:35:38] Mauraderss: Yo towelliee, are you going to be playing season of discovery? What class looks appealing
[1:35:40] timex1: cross realm stuff going to work on RP servers?
[1:35:41] PadidinJones: @Towelliee quick take on new expac/3 expacs?
[1:35:41] Line_0: @baldarsar I mean they immediately said "warbands is just a cool name for account wide". Can't get more clearer
[1:35:42] CrunkyBrewster: im excited for Shared Banking and Reagent Bags
[1:35:44] BoringBrit: servers mean nothing at that point R)
[1:36:00] Dax0n3: i think the Warbands is the biggest W
[1:36:04] CrunkyBrewster: they really dont mean anything yea
[1:36:06] Dopplebok: Pre-purchase boosted char starts with a higher ilvl than my main LUL
[1:36:20] Jarlan23: recruiting and getting ur raiders to stay in 11.0 will be a lot more competitive
[1:36:27] jarilrpg: @Towelliee dont know if you saw, Ion confirmed a fated season 4 for DF
[1:36:27] strike879: or if you have a million alts and dont want to transfer them all
[1:36:27] Fazerna: I wanted 10 player Mythic mode, but cross server stuff was cool too
[1:36:28] Kellytaaa: Kellytaaa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! WoW future is bright :D
[1:36:30] akia03: would they remove region locks?
[1:36:34] kyotoboss: @Dopplebok start gaming ma man
[1:36:35] wildragehs44: how was blizzcon. and i was excited for the wow classic news
[1:36:36] Milanesa_De_Pollo: They need to either increase guild roster, or have it where you join with your bnet rather than characters, as alts take up too much space
[1:36:41] Effin_Steffin: Login screen alone is worth it
[1:36:42] CrunkyBrewster: the login screen very diablo 2 to me
[1:36:48] sellblade: @Towelliee I wonder if their can build on the Delve tech in the future to make Dungeons and Raids a seamless entering process without a loading screen? The way it works intrigues me a little. Has to be a mix of their Sharding tech + Airlock
[1:36:51] Shrenko: I hope you can change the background
[1:36:59] Dinermoe: the thing thats weird to me is the fact that in an interview, morgan day said warbands are planned to be a War Within feature only so far
[1:37:00] CrunkyBrewster: LUL
[1:37:02] BoezIRL: the ah will be interesting
[1:37:03] DunzoCD: for such a small thing im so hyped for that login screen i love the lost ark screen being able to see all your toons
[1:37:05] WundertueteGER: PogChamp
[1:37:06] mavericks312: i wonder if they will add backscreens to get in game for your warband
[1:37:06] chefdejour82: im guess in can also change the background
[1:37:06] Avalonshade: Yes! And I hope we get a variety of backdrops just like Lost Ark!
[1:37:06] notdustinx: so sick dude
[1:37:07] Dopplebok: @kyotoboss I need those Deeeeelves for my solo play
[1:37:08] Alisera: i love it
[1:37:08] alextheory_: the good whole yoink and twist from blizzard we are so back
[1:37:08] notdustinx: W
[1:37:10] CrunkyBrewster: that is a nice touch
[1:37:13] Shrenko: the background is from Azure span
[1:37:24] notdustinx: SHAMAN TANK @Towelliee
[1:37:26] Djfarmville: cobalt sanctum
[1:37:26] WundertueteGER: I'm so hyped, i want it now PogChamp
[1:37:28] Cabbageman007: Love seeing You and Sloot back together again!
[1:37:34] Cabbageman007: slootFistLove slootSmug
[1:37:35] neverbornlucky: is blizzcon over ?
[1:37:37] BoezIRL: hope you can change the camp
[1:37:38] mavericks312: imagine gettin an achievement that rewards an icecrown background for that screen
[1:37:39] Line_0: Delve stuff is amazing for those of us who hate m+
[1:37:40] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Cafe0le (warning)
[1:37:40] exiled__93: Weren't delves on like eso
[1:37:45] SphinxyOCE: gotta see it in action to really know
[1:37:45] lesley2280: Hi Towelliee no mention of player housing i see
[1:37:47] Dopplebok: slootFistLove slootFistLove
[1:37:50] Jarlan23: i hope theyre not just the digs for loamme i hope theyre more involved than that
[1:37:50] cipusanx: put the D in the elves and you get delves @Towelliee
[1:37:51] akia03: delves give hc raid endboss lvl gar
[1:37:54] CrunkyBrewster: correct me if Im wrong. Atre WoW Delves like ESO's Delves? Open World single dungeon areas?
[1:37:55] r_Wazze: island expeditions sounded fun too
[1:37:56] Line_0: 15 m+ is good
[1:38:00] Alisera: im so excited to see content like delves
[1:38:01] Molvonos: @Towelliee I enjoyed seeing you in front of that empty display.
[1:38:01] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Delves sounds like those niffen digs, but scaled up
[1:38:01] josdm34: WoW is going in the good direction
[1:38:02] Mauraderss: @towelliee what is the perk to the characters being in a warband? Or is that screen just for looks
[1:38:02] tmiguel27: How does warband really works do you think we have a limit of carachters for that?
[1:38:02] BoezIRL: hc mode
[1:38:04] Melonbrew: They said Heroic level of loot
[1:38:05] HerbieEregos: Delves will be huge the moment we get them in the old world which we for sure will as he says its Evergreen
[1:38:06] just_laxus: i am so excited for delves since i don't raid or do mythic+
[1:38:08] Melonbrew: not mythic
[1:38:17] alextheory_: daaaaamn
[1:38:17] StraightErro: delves were 1-5 people I thought
[1:38:23] Riondrius: Thoughts on the new xpac names? WOW WW or WoW Midnight seem kinda silly to me
[1:38:25] shadowtalya: Nice
[1:38:27] Collected1: you didn't fall asleep in a fast food establishment like one content creator
[1:38:27] mavericks312: @tmiguel27 no limits and everything is account wide
[1:38:32] BoezIRL: @StraightErro they are
[1:38:36] ytsidilas: I do think that 15 is too much of a challenge for some of the players
[1:38:41] WSilverHawkW: @tmiguel27 There is no limit, everything is account based, the selection screen is just for showing off your 4 characters
[1:38:41] kyotoboss: @StraightErro yes they are
[1:38:42] Beltorz: what is delves?
[1:38:43] CrunkyBrewster: I saw it hehe
[1:38:44] lumaday: lol
[1:38:49] Sollice: Where is drunk with Ted
[1:38:50] sellblade: @Towelliee They said the Loot range is somewhere in that up to 15ish Area. The difficulty is scalable to some extent. Guess the difficulty will be similar, so top end Delves are around Key +15 difficulty
[1:38:51] Sollice: passed out?
[1:38:53] Collected1: Sloot tweeted it
[1:38:53] CrunkyBrewster: there it is

[1:39:03] neverbornlucky: Towelliee tell us the truth when do we get to go back to shadowlands
[1:39:03] devoted_bee: BOOBA
[1:39:03] tmiguel27: @mavericks312 but i see some caracthers belong and others that dont
[1:39:04] CrunkyBrewster: awww tuckered out
[1:39:04] Andruin88: :D
[1:39:06] Melonbrew: If delves deliver then I am all set. I can't raid and M+. If I can delve and Raid I would drop M+ in a heartbeat

[2:11:01] dream_boxing: @bigcountry555 yes the wallpapers are free after the 3.99
[2:11:03] mavericks312: i would think the 3rd xpac would be the longest
[2:11:04] gho5tfinger: annual
[2:11:04] blinca: that 3 day antecipated acess feels so shitty
[2:11:07] westsidewow: what do  you think about them saying that this will be the last raid of the expansion?
[2:11:08] CipansR_Ayaya: faster monkaS
[2:11:08] jarilrpg: thats about 2 years per expansion
[2:11:10] zmorix2013: id say the first 2 will be short and the 3rd a normal timeline
[2:11:15] bigcountry555: @dream_boxing ty
[2:11:16] Folgrum: 2 raid tier mayby in each expansions ?
[2:11:17] dracullus: @Towelliee I think it will be big finale for WoW1 as well
[2:11:17] alvyOG: did they explicitly say the Saga was only 3 parts?
[2:11:19] EKS90_: its prob 1½ years instead of 2, to not have that 6-10 months deadtime.
[2:11:19] bekindtoeachothr: I think the headline is misleading they ment before 2030
[2:11:25] valianya: 2 year cycles
[2:11:25] Clicklesly: Ah, i actually worried if these expansions would also mean increased cadence, like 1/year
[2:11:28] dSaipher: Sounds like the '2030' date is more sarcastic than anything else
[2:11:28] Arore_1599: that like now... 2 years per
[2:11:28] Line_0: A few months faster than 2 years per expansion
[2:11:35] byrdeen45: Xpac every year ?
[2:11:35] dream_boxing: @bigcountry555 yep!
[2:11:37] DarqStalker: 2024-2026, 26-28, 28-30 I'm guessing
[2:11:38] Anachron10: thats good, a main sotry line like going from .1 to .2 shoudnt take 6 months
[2:11:40] Densetsu_: So, same as Dragonflight went probably
[2:11:40] WSilverHawkW: I read in an interview they have a team already working on Midnight
[2:11:41] Djfarmville: So we prob not getting mop classic during those 4 years
[2:11:43] DunzoCD: itll prolly be more like 18 months
[2:11:47] Sykum: another level squish
[2:11:48] zenkodac: Its probably gona be from 2025 to 2029, that would be one and a half year expacs which cuts the normal 6 months of dead time we have per expac
[2:11:50] Djfarmville: 6
[2:11:50] dracullus: imo 3.5 seasons, 18 month is perfect length
[2:11:54] lalelusa: with an xpac every 2 years, the last one will go live in 2028 and in 2030 we'll start a new saga
[2:11:59] lumaday: comes out fall 2024 right?
[2:12:00] gho5tfinger: @Towelliee do you think worldsoul saga will be the end and then they make wow2 copium lol
[2:12:03] Line_0: Not 2 years because that would mean the last titan is released in end of 2028 and run into 2030. So it's like 18 month expansions
[2:12:04] mavericks312: bro these guys are iron men the way there pumping out content
[2:12:05] Collected1: oh damn
[2:12:10] Collected1: already working on 12.0

[2:12:24] Kinghorn: covidlands
[2:12:25] Dibsy: @Towelliee do you recon this is the end of WOW and after the saga we will get WOW2?
[2:12:26] yelp26: And now they have microsoft money
[2:12:44] thor798: I love how the Midnight Expansion will be 12.0
[2:12:47] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee they said they don't want anymore 8 month droughts at the end of the expansion
[2:12:50] jbmoongirl: Every 8 weeks is great
[2:12:55] mavericks312: getting there 15$ worth and more

[2:13:51] zenkodac: People assuming since the expac is shorter we're getting less content  but to me it just seems the same amount of content just less spread  over time

[2:20:40] RSBlunden: that fake Avaloren leak got me good @Towelliee
[2:20:41] Animemron: You should check if you got the two swords from the trading post. Alot of people didnt get them if they completed the travelers log too early.
[2:20:43] Sielu11628: The Demo people pulled out

[2:21:21] HerbieEregos: the leak was a lot of teases we got that could be real but lore wise, less so expansion wise
[2:21:26] Collected1: the fact they kept the 3 expansion drop a secret is mind blowing
[2:21:28] Line_0: The only thing the leaks got right was stuff already in game btw
[2:21:29] Skobble: @Towelliee when did you know about the new Expansion?

[2:22:03] jarilrpg: @biohazard1935 10.2.5, so next patch
[2:22:04] dracullus: its because we knew about Algarian Stormrider = Khaz Algar = Dwarfs
[2:22:04] Ferokz: They couldn't have done it better imo
[2:22:08] peon501: ngl wow getting interesting, I might come back after 10+ years of hibernation.

[2:27:56] SisterblissUK: I love the warband logging screen, i wonder if we can customize the background
[2:28:00] RandomGamerChick: I wonder if there's a cut off between "warbands" like will it only be 5 characters or something...?
[2:28:00] WSilverHawkW: @DiranJei there is no limit, everything is account wide, the 4 thing is just display on character selection

[2:28:11] Snappole_: did they ever mention what the ilvl from the vault could possibly go up to?
[2:28:11] jbmoongirl: I like the crafting shared stuff.
[2:28:16] alextheory_: gold account wide will be easier for world first guild to pay helper KEKW
[2:28:17] diyreality: will warbands be limited? 5 alts?
[2:28:18] jbmoongirl: Out of the warbanf

[2:28:29] jeffnsteff2019: wait what prophecy did anduin see
[2:28:31] Cafe0le: another xpac without a mage tower 2.0
[2:28:33] src1923: they might be the new "mage tower"
[2:28:33] akia03: atleast delves give hc raid gear
[2:28:36] Eviltuna13: so now you just need 1 gather and can use bank to craft from?
[2:28:37] Megadisaster24: aren't Delves in the Open World though?
[2:28:40] CrunkyBrewster: yeah i was hoping it'd be like ESO's Delves

[2:28:52] thecrimpchimp: Delves similar to ESO would be amazing
[2:28:53] HerbieEregos: Delves feels like their way to add content to the Old World tbh via those instanced areas
[2:28:54] WundertueteGER: mage tower Aware
[2:29:07] src1923: they gonna reward heroic raid ilvl or mytihc plus 15 gear so they should be challenging enough
[2:29:11] Melonbrew: I am not a high M+ player but if I have an option for progression without doing M+ I am all for it
[2:29:11] DiranJei: @WSilverHawkW ooooh gotcha. thanks <3
[2:29:18] dSaipher: Yo here's a crazy question: i boosted a toon with the pre-order boost and it didn't give me shoulders, wrists, or belt? is this a bug?
[2:29:18] valianya: Ian talked about Delves and they sound more fun than Scenarios because less restricting

[2:31:19] tezrelli: it's magni asking for more azerite
[2:31:19] Larc9783: I dunno why they are pushing the anduin/arthas angle when they did arthas so dirty in Shadowlands
[2:31:19] sorliee: Did you like Anduins new design?
[2:31:22] JBonezey: They are doing the Star Wars thing. Arthas was Vader, Anduin is Luke.
[2:31:22] cranked2023: I didnt catch it, but that was emotional man. ngl he had me in the feel,s
[2:31:23] gho5tfinger: has to be azeroth

[2:33:22] WundertueteGER: Aware
[2:33:25] mavericks312: probably a new planet and a fresh new story
[2:33:26] riotinprogress: WoW 2 in Unreal 7
[2:33:26] Herzenliegen: That's what I'm excited for.
[2:33:27] StraightErro: @Towelliee the expansion name also has double-meaning, not just going underground, but also inner turmoil for Anduin
[2:33:29] Molvonos: @Towelliee Check Disc
[2:33:31] Snabido: Here comes the WoW2 train

[2:33:50] bygodwest: the last titan logo looks exactly like the prisons the primal incarnates were kept in
[2:33:51] chewyy514: i think thats when we either get a full world revamp as azeroth wakes up, or we legit bounce to a different planet
[2:33:52] zenkodac: probably not that long , i assume this saga is gona last like 4 to 5 years
[2:33:52] Exoduc: its just metzen telling us he needs 3 expansions to clean up the mess they made after he left @Towelliee
[2:33:53] WytChapp: im most excited for midnight tbh

[2:34:03] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee Midnight is the 12th expac
[2:34:06] Rturnerz: When Azeroth finally wakes up we realise there’s another side and spend 25 years on that side this time
[2:34:06] mavericks312: @Zeppyy funny of you to assume we remain on azeroath
[2:34:08] SensationalBanana: WoW 2 would be my way out. I ain't restarting from scratch after 20 years, come on now.
[2:34:09] CrunkyBrewster: no shot they do a WoW 2 i feel
[2:34:11] Rulem: This engine will be 24-26 years old by the end of the sage; its time for a new engine
[2:34:17] Kelticlore: I feel midway through the last titan that well see azeroth be woke  up
[2:34:20] jason_tacey: @Towelliee at the end of the cinematic they said the sword was pointed at someone, who do you think it could be?
[2:34:26] Herzenliegen: @darqstalker haha I thought about that after they announced it LUL
[2:34:29] d1stract10n: @Towelliee remember there is "deceit and turmoil" within the titans
[2:34:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: @kuiper_ow those are usually a few months later
[2:34:30] mavericks312: @Rulem not gonna happen
[2:34:38] Shrenko: Ulduar towPog
[2:34:39] essadis: leak season, my ass...leaky ass!
[2:34:39] just_laxus: that looks kinda like the war within logo
[2:34:45] valianya: Next story might be travelling the Dark Beyond of space on a Living Titan planet
[2:34:47] skoll135: It’s Titan architecture
[2:34:47] Megadragoonx: Moobot still saying Avaloren leaks
[2:34:48] liviu_81: vast Pog
[2:34:51] deaddwarfwalking: northrend will get a revamp in that xpac
[2:34:51] Snabido: If your Algalon tattoo starts blinking, please notify us monkaS
[2:34:51] CanadianCataclysm: They will test the waters with different systems through Classic (season of discovery) as well as what works and what does not work with retail systems. Then after the saga is done they will roll out wow 2.0 on the unreal 5 engine
[2:34:52] Beerplz: @Towelliee it looks like the prison Iridrikron was in , in the first raid of Dragonflight
[2:34:54] Engram08: if you look at the icons for both 3 xpacs, it seems the last titan Azeroth the planet is gone
[2:34:54] CrunkyBrewster: I have that same feeling Tow
[2:34:54] DunzoCD: gotta be when azeroth wakes up
[2:34:54] WundertueteGER: yea 100%
[2:34:55] xALcaPWNedx: got me motivated to just level brand new toons in retail...ready for TWW
[2:34:55] jeffnsteff2019: titans are bad guys
[2:34:57] Razekichoo: titans are just as bad as the void IMO
[2:34:58] essadis: the Titans are a griefer guild
[2:34:58] Kinghorn: mommy eonar cant be a bad guy
[2:35:00] Broseidon7624: Our lord and savior illidan will return
[2:35:01] shizengoki: Just like in Attack on Titan
[2:35:01] Whammostar: algolans door?
[2:35:04] MarcoTheGreat: Azeroth was made to cleanse the universe and start again @Towelliee
[2:35:04] lalelusa: bc the Titans aren't bad guys? *gasp*
[2:35:05] Blankelos: well atleast aman thul can not me trusted
[2:35:06] diyreality: algalon speech for something
[2:35:07] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Metzen spoils the next 2 expansions because he's tired of streamers like Towelliee leaking expansions Kappa
[2:35:08] Ezekyler: Sargeras did nothing wrong
[2:35:08] Mr_Arson: The titans are bad guys and Sargerath was the based truther who knew Azeroth was the real big bad
[2:35:09] xhaven: I hope they just dont try to make Titans evil though
[2:35:09] WytChapp: @PvtHudson093 11th
[2:35:11] smashwow: more like a dyson sphere
[2:35:11] Larc9783: Iridicron got put in the freezer
[2:35:11] DunzoCD: xalatath has the thing iridikron took in DotI
[2:35:12] Felldoh_: Definitely happening... Story is going to be that the Titans imprisoned Azeroth and we will free her
[2:35:14] radkkos: They cant spoil the raid to come and the last cinematic
[2:35:14] Thewunk: The hype is real!!!!!
[2:35:15] StraightErro: Sargeras gonna realize he got played by the Jailer and turn all good
[2:35:20] jbmoongirl: There is so much they didn’t mention.
[2:35:20] Herzenliegen: Well in DF they keep saying how bad the titans are
[2:35:22] essadis: i hope Azeroth has massive bodonghonkaroos
[2:35:23] KiLLMasTer20: @essadis what one there is 15 guilds with that name
[2:35:24] Razekichoo: titans =/= void @Towelliee
[2:35:25] WSilverHawkW: Iridikron is calling the titans to come back in The Last Titan
[2:35:27] Vapo: my bet is that hes boss at second raid tier in TWW
[2:35:28] CrunkyBrewster: The Twist: The Titans are the real bad guys and the Void are actually good guys
[2:35:29] src1923: 10.2.5 will be about iridikron i think they kinda hinted at that
[2:35:32] Yurian33: they are going the Babylon 5 route with the Vorlons.... We dont need your light / dark war... get out of our galaxy
[2:35:35] mavericks312: i could see xal'atah not needing iridikron anymore an just offing him
[2:35:38] Beerplz: @Towelliee the logo is the prison of Iridikron where we free her after killing Raszageth
[2:35:40] WeE_wOo_WhEn: Iridicron was wandering off to the void peeps
[2:35:42] ZarisHeal: anyone said anything about crests? are they gonna keep crests in tww too?
[2:35:44] Vigilnace: Nobbel said something about iridikron in the book. He could be a boss in The Last Titan
[2:35:46] Folgrum: last titan will be raid with titans as enemy and azerth as last titan ally ? probably
[2:35:46] ragehoof24: i think the idea some people throwing out might be true.... Azeroth is the only titan we have ever seen period and the others are just constructs
[2:35:47] HerbieEregos: He is moving the trinket to the next expansion
[2:35:47] hippieh8rlol: The new Diablo glyph icon looks oddly similar to Rhykers logo lol
[2:35:48] essadis: @KiLLMasTer20 oh man...i thought names were unique...no wonder
[2:35:48] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Maybe we team up with Iridikron

[2:39:05] Herzenliegen: I thought the same thing

[2:39:26] rws26: It's a crystal sun, not the sword apparently, but should be
[2:39:27] nytebayne: so excited about hero talents
[2:39:29] HerbieEregos: its something different and it looks like an Azerite light source
[2:39:30] Jinx1348: three zones under ground and that is not the sword.

[3:07:51] HaloS23: @Towelliee So clarify: Metzen said "we are going back to Quel"thalas and Northred" in the next expansions. Are we going back in time or just going back???

[3:08:17] xotankkk: asmongold think he is a pussy asss bitch

[3:08:18] Seventhedeadly: He looks like the dude from Arrow
[3:08:19] maccaruso: Feelings is how you get invested in characters.....
[3:08:19] DeanoTV: Asmon viewers....
[3:08:21] VarlBGem: Remember how young Varian looked early on, and then how he was at the end?

[3:08:32] Snabido: "You are not prepared" didnt give y'all feels? CoolCat
[3:08:32] LadineL337: It's supposed to give you an emotional connection to the game
[3:08:33] zenkodac: They do know that being mad, angry, aggresive is also feelings

[3:08:35] skmma897: its when you have too much of it that makes it just weird
[3:08:37] HAMMERRAZOR: nobbel said it best, for story to have substance you have to have some story with emotion behind it
[3:08:37] kalamari__: DF hasnt. its not deep or interesting at all
[3:08:38] Dys_Troy: Hes a Beta, this is warcraft lol....
[3:08:42] src1923: asmon viewers mostly
[3:08:42] bgriff87: Gotta get an emotional response from your product. Gotta market it
[3:08:43] Th0rdoth: maybe he feels he is not worthy of anything. Genn said that "long hair" was a "mark" of his family. Maybe that's why the "my son" triggers him on the cinematic
[3:08:44] liviu_81: draenor had some good feelings stuff
[3:08:47] Nerendis: What kind of man child is afraid of feelings in a cinematic? Wtf?

[3:08:49] lumaday: While conscious that he was doing it
[3:08:50] XLcoj: Could Arthas be alive in him?
[3:08:50] wildwittra: will Anduin ever be king when he himself does not trust him ? what will the Alliance think of a mentally flawed leader ?
[3:08:51] mavericks312: this man was mind controlled and killed ppl and attempted to kill his friends
[3:08:51] LazerChickenTV: At least they show him as realistic, id be more worried if he had no feelings
[3:08:51] Nokterian: he had could see what was happening he had no control
[3:08:52] Theduskflyer: Oh he’s the next Lich king
[3:08:52] CelestialVoyager: "Remember that the most epic stories start with small heartfelt moments" - Chris Metzen
[3:08:57] maccaruso: maccaruso subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[3:08:57] drackmesh: Putress betrayals in WotlK was emotional and it was the first right ?
[3:08:57] Redpandalol: @Towelliee do you think we have been too hard on andy? i mean his dad died and varians shoes are huge to fill. he had to step in as king, he never got to mourn his dad. he then got kidnapped and brainwashed. he has had a rough go
[3:09:00] Aidler: because feelings define humans/people
[3:09:01] MsAriez: and Syl can't feel the same seeing how she went through it as well

[3:09:06] mayonaes: All of these gig chads out here don't have feelings
[3:09:07] Yetik: The domination messed him up
[3:09:08] Masqerader: look at Resident Evil Series, Leon and Chris got some major ptsd
[3:09:09] MrWoodsmith: it just Asmon spergs freaking out about emotions.
[3:09:10] Calphurnious: @Towelliee With them doing some modular mounts, what you think the odds of them doing some modular weapons or something too?
[3:09:10] zenkodac: Exactllly
[3:09:11] bgriff87: yup
[3:09:12] Hebrewish012: the fact that he even agreed to join thrall surprised me
[3:09:13] Kyetto53: what if the sword is for his dad?  his dad could be the last titan!!!
[3:09:16] Tuturs: Thrall took a time in Nagrand too
[3:09:17] SensationalBanana: Feelings are not dangerous nor abnormal. More guys need to know this.
[3:09:18] geokouts: grew up with No mother, father mostly not in his life and then died
[3:09:18] ilovethemapdust: That sword gave me some emotions.
[3:09:22] HaloS23: IM IN!! pure and simple!
[3:09:23] jayaiir: It wouldn't make any sense if he wasn't sensitive. He isn't a battle hardened stoic.
[3:09:24] DewiTT___: Definitely was in my feelings
[3:09:25] EpicJune: Kind of, not major emotion imho
[3:09:25] Mr_Arson: After all the stuff those blizz devs went through the last 5 years, no wonder they want to talk about feelings
[3:09:26] stressley89: he got mind duckt by bot
[3:09:26] Broseidon7624: @Elff11 wallpaper engine on steam
[3:09:29] TazIsSum: i act like i have +50 toughness but really im -100 afraid Kappa
[3:09:34] rws26: The feelings stuff in DF hasn't been great though.
[3:09:35] Fazerna: People who cannot handle feelings are afraid of them
[3:09:39] jayXtream: the combination of chris metzen coming back and then this crying anduin... doesn't work for me.
[3:09:39] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!

[3:09:44] Yetik: Im putting a spoiler on that shit KEKW
[3:09:45] FoolMonty: wotlk trailer still stirs me lol
[3:09:47] Shrenko: @Towelliee you should try to customize the new one from epic edition

[3:10:02] zenkodac: I wish they did the same to the m+ mount cus those are always so lame
[3:10:05] flebbooo: I'm curious if we'll see Anduin embracing more of his Shadow priest side with his loss of the light
[3:10:13] bgriff87: @Towelliee whats the background called on wallpaper engine?
[3:10:15] SensationalBanana: @Respls We are going back to Northrend in a future expansion.

[3:17:40] IgoR_25: They are dead as long as the writers want to
[3:17:41] Greencaps07: from the character pov wouldnt it be dead but are they ?
[3:17:46] Molvonos: I think the 'Black Empire is Dead' is that all the old gods are dead-dead.
[3:17:46] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:17:52] Berthez94: not a fan of how a they leave a massive cliff hanger (sargeras sword in azeroth) and taking years to return to it and leaving it out for a couple of expansions.
[3:17:52] sitmeee: lets find out together
[3:17:53] Ryukotsu: Do the old gods actually die if we dont kill them in their own realm?
[3:17:53] mavericks312: i hope xal'atath stretches the whole saga
[3:17:53] BarrayarGaming: maybe they are like pokemon, not dead but like in a coma :D
[3:17:57] Molvonos: Which I'm very happy they finally vocalized that, it's what I speculated for years.

[3:18:02] charlie_the_snowman: @Poriand patience young padathrall
[3:18:06] Sorraxe: @Towelliee they want them dead so they move on to their masters, void lords?
[3:18:08] MrBr1ghtsid3: Mayhap they pull an Undertaker stunt
[3:18:24] LucidEhms: @Berthez94 That's why they are doing this world soul saga thing, so theres always a thread
[3:18:25] smashwow: "dead" they've said they can't die before right?
[3:18:31] wildwittra: wait for the Return of the Jailor. "Shadowlands, part 2"
[3:18:33] theoneeleven: @Berthez94 they have previously said expansions were written as one of stories. That is why we were left with hanging threads constantly
[3:18:35] charlie_the_snowman: I wanna wife a nerubian
[3:18:42] sadstruggle: sadstruggle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! towHAMUP

[4:06:36] Brodih_: Sloot did not give a hint of returning to WoW after the event?
[4:06:41] Molvonos: I'll be honest, whenever I see 'delves', my brain translated it to 'deep elves' or some sort of 'd elves'
[4:06:47] vikaelzidek: where at the point if u die in real life u can return again and play wow again in your next life lol

[4:08:23] HaloS23: in a way i hope they drop a sub number... would like to see
[4:08:25] Seerated: I still think alot of the active subs actually are us that have been playing since Vanilla. I'm closing 50 yrs old and time is ofc an issue
[4:08:26] zenkodac: EpicSwag17 they are talking about their philosophy, keep watching cus that is everything else

[4:09:23] gho5tfinger: removing pvp from great vault
[4:09:24] lumaday: Ion crushed the ddep dive
[4:09:28] Kneckt: the deep dive was INSANEly goof
[4:09:29] HaloS23: @Drakenking true, still am curious tho
[4:09:29] 91Niki: As a casual player who don't wanna rely on pugs, this is HUUUUUGE
[4:09:30] Kneckt: good
[4:09:34] Molvonos: @Dinermoe Nah, they got a system that's better for them actually
[4:09:38] macmittens808: They finally let Ion cook

[4:10:00] nytebayne: like eso!
[4:10:00] Molvonos: They removed the RNG aspect of gearing for PvP, which works better imo
[4:10:00] Line_0: yeah they said it will carry over

[4:10:13] Jamcal: @Dinermoe Not really, PvP conquest is getting buffed so we'll get the same amount of gear (or more) without the RNG of the vault (and means we can get PvE and PvP gear on the same char without cucking yourself) EZ
[4:10:13] magisterofquelthalas: Can u imagine adding DELVES as a levelling OPTION?
[4:10:13] gho5tfinger: eso has delves that work well, idk if it will be the same

[4:15:12] herr_iceman: agree
[4:15:13] notColt45: Now can we get bonus loot for how large our warband is?
[4:15:14] flebbooo: huuuuge W
[4:15:14] EnragedPyro: kinda shocked it took so long.
[4:15:15] KingSlayerYotam: collecting is the main gameplay loop
[4:15:15] rbolude: W
[4:15:16] unowncreature: been needing this for a while
[4:15:16] valth: i have 27alts and i love transmog this is  HUGE win for me
[4:15:16] elsnickito: another thing like gw2, nothing new
[4:15:16] MagicMarker1: big time saver
[4:15:17] DunzoCD: just do mog runs on druids and DH now so its fast
[4:15:17] zenkodac: its why i stopped farming tmog
[4:15:19] Mattsta: I hope they also open up transmog appearances application...bit annoying to only be able to set like 6/8 of a different classes raid set pieces
[4:15:20] Snabido: For all the people that has unused Tusks in their bank
[4:15:20] sorliee: Ye massive W
[4:15:21] Yetik: Giga W
[4:15:22] ClassicMalcontent: Glad I don't care about Xmog but glad for others its coming.
[4:15:25] zenkodac: so im super excited
[4:15:27] macmittens808: I'm upset it wasn't sooner, already did all my mog runs
[4:15:27] Mr_Arson: WoW: TWW has been all W's so far Kappa
[4:15:28] Tharia: like my paladin keeps geting mail that never drops for my hunter!
[4:15:29] Maldor313: nice, now I can run Garrosh with all my alts to try an get that damn shouldepads LUL
[4:15:32] Seventhedeadly: Im so happy about that
[4:15:33] Tharia: ugh. this is fantastic
[4:15:35] Ardailec: Hell just making it so you don't biff a drop because it happened on the wrong character is nice
[4:15:39] Sykum: reading
[4:15:39] Zivs: looks like he needs glasses yea
[4:15:41] ArcaneMaki: suinting at prompter
[4:15:42] zenkodac: yes
[4:15:42] Drakenking: its super bright on stage
[4:15:42] JasperCalico: forgot his contacts
[4:15:42] SavageCheez: Lights
[4:15:43] Yosbo: prob has 2982092 lights in his face
[4:15:44] dapeanutbutter: light probably
[4:15:44] maccaruso: Squinting at teh prompter
[4:15:45] Broseidon7624: think the spotlight in his face is messing with him
[4:15:45] limburgse: the only thing i dont like is that earthern dwarves will be playable for Horde, imo Dwarves are really Alliance
[4:15:47] Consor: he was staring at the prompter the whole time
[4:15:47] unowncreature: probably just stage light
[4:15:48] Veegore: It's not quite just collecting. you get the drop and then you have to put it in the warband stash and take it out on someone that can equip it
[4:15:48] MisterBongwater: I often wonder if there was some technical challenge that kept them from doing it before
[4:15:49] Snackyy23: I think it was the light as well
[4:15:49] BoezIRL: yeah he is trying to read
[4:15:51] zulter2: It really seems like they're finally listening to the community. Chris came back and started smacking them around LUL
[4:15:52] kokochris: Might be the light in his eye
[4:15:52] mavericks312: Retail is back baby!!
[4:15:52] instructOS: probably high
[4:15:53] Amarger: This will bring in so many more tmog collectors as it will have a way lower barrier to entry
[4:15:59] Nico_vdM: Just imagine how HUGE the addon ATT is going to be with EVERYTHING combined
[4:15:59] kokochris: Super awesome
[4:15:59] lumaday: another Huge W
[4:16:00] Azzudin: Now you got to do a raid on ALL of your tunes each week for that 1 drop! lol
[4:16:00] HatchlingMiquela: lights are really difficult if you arent used to being on stages
[4:16:01] ZeroNpcTV: LETSGO
[4:16:02] Kaernunnos: well he did say people would screencap weird faces...
[4:16:03] Goodnevi1: Seems like he's having g a hard time reading prompter
[4:16:03] Kriven: prolly light. stage lights suck when they hit you
[4:16:04] Nokterian: towLets towGo
[4:16:06] VarlBGem: One rep to rule them all
[4:16:06] MrFuzzynuts420: you're also gonna be able to send loot with Warbands, so if you get plate loot on your leather toon you can send it to your warrior or dk or whatever
[4:16:07] x___shadow___x: might be both as the woman said about it being bright and not being able to see everyone
[4:16:09] toobaked1987: It only took 86 years to do that
[4:16:10] stallowned: account wide is a giant W

[4:16:15] Ferokz: He will explain that
[4:16:16] JasperCalico: they explain that actually
[4:16:17] DxDamn: he will tell you
[4:16:18] lumaday: Because Druids are hard
[4:16:18] qualybased: do you think metzen had any impact with war within?
[4:16:18] jawnskii_: chickens are dope
[4:16:20] Metket: @Towelliee ian mentioned that
[4:16:20] rymerre: cuz they always dev the druid first
[4:16:21] Ribbheden: Because druids are special LUL
[4:16:21] zenkodac: ion said why
[4:16:21] kibarashi: lol, they will explain why
[4:16:22] Todmeister9000: Ion said they always do druids first
[4:16:24] CanadianCataclysm: They explain it
[4:16:26] DunzoCD: they complain the most
[4:16:26] DraulTheVikingFox: are hero talents gonna be character defining?
[4:16:27] Nokterian: There always using druid because its the most complex class in the game @Towelliee
[4:16:27] Kriven: so are all the hero talents just passives?
[4:16:27] ijuki: They actually explain why boomkin is used first
[4:16:27] Ch0p_Su3y: druids are usually the more complex
[4:16:27] BradySafety: ion explains it
[4:16:28] Exoduc: they say druids are hardest
[4:16:28] Goodnevi1: He tells you
[4:16:28] dindu1: probably the only one thats "ready" KEKW
[4:16:29] MizixTV: Ion explained it
[4:16:29] just_laxus: ion actually explained why u see mostly druids first
[4:16:29] Staaxxs: he tells you lol
[4:16:30] MisterBongwater: hehe remember what ion said "if we can make it work on druids, everything else will be easy"
[4:16:30] NovaNax: its them saying you wont ever get rid of the chicken
[4:16:31] ursinealli: Ion said they start with druid cause if they system works for druid they can usually make it work for others
[4:16:32] jeffnsteff2019: because druids are red headed step child of wow
[4:16:36] souleymaster: druid hardest tree out there
[4:16:37] TekReset: they said they uise drui9ds cause if they c can make it work for them then othersa should be easy
[4:16:38] oleohlsen: Druid is probably the most played class?
[4:16:39] ColdIceCreamMan: ion explained it. "they are the hardest to do, so we do them first"
[4:16:39] DraulTheVikingFox: like will they potentially add new roles to classes?
[4:16:42] Nokterian: its passive
[4:16:42] JasperCalico: mostly passive
[4:16:44] Ferokz: Yeah nvm ion explained the druid thing
[4:16:46] Nokterian: no button bloat
[4:16:46] Armdel: he goes through some examples
[4:16:47] WSilverHawkW: yes, all passives
[4:16:47] Maldor313: they always start with druids and always make crappy things for them at the start LUL
[4:16:47] zenkodac: yea
[4:16:48] Von_Liechtenstein: Most is passive
[4:16:48] Rhea_the_Cat: @Towelliee They keep saying evergreen this and that, whats evergreen
[4:16:49] Jarlan23: they said most of them would be passive yeah
[4:16:49] The_Stogie: yea they are passive
[4:16:51] CanadianCataclysm: They have to work on Druids first due to it has 4 specs.. So if a system works for Druids then they can make it work for all the classes/specs
[4:16:57] PidiaP: Ion said its cause of druids being complicated
[4:16:57] zenkodac: seemed so atleast form the examples ion gave
[4:17:00] MrFuzzynuts420: i can't wait to AoE stormbolt people in arenas LUL
[4:17:03] zenkodac: from*
[4:17:11] Staaxxs: @Towelliee basically druid is the hardest to do this stuff on because they have 4 specs, so they start with druid
[4:17:13] Crimzon7: yeah said they will be passive unlease it makes sense
[4:17:18] sorliee: Slayer GIGACHAD
[4:17:33] BoezIRL: yes
[4:17:35] Nokterian: its a great system
[4:17:36] TheGiant99: @Towelliee you gonna watch the deep dive again
[4:17:37] Von_Liechtenstein: YEs
[4:17:38] Nerendis: correct
[4:17:38] DunzoCD: its like an ascendency
[4:17:38] Sykum: choose 1
[4:17:39] MrFuzzynuts420: yup
[4:17:39] PharoGames: correct
[4:17:40] Von_Liechtenstein: Correct
[4:17:40] Goodnevi1: Correct
[4:17:41] unowncreature: yea
[4:17:42] WSilverHawkW: yes
[4:17:42] just_laxus: yes
[4:17:43] zenkodac: yup
[4:17:43] flebbooo: correct
[4:17:46] VarlBGem: Mountain Thane! towLets towGo
[4:17:49] Veegore: Yea it's a choice between the two
[4:17:55] TheGiant99: The Deep Dive is awesome
[4:17:59] yib_: yes you can hybrid from what you are speced into and one of the other
[4:18:02] BobLongMVP: so sick
[4:18:02] DraulTheVikingFox: dwarf slayer!
[4:18:03] zulter2: I feel like Mountain Thane should be renamed to Thunderlord. Mountain Thane feels too dwarf agnostic
[4:18:10] Julifrass: The Hero Specs names all sound so cool
[4:18:19] Featherbow: @Rhea_the_Cat it means not aimed at any one thing. The actual definition is  universally and continually relevant : not limited in applicability to a particular event or date.
[4:18:22] Nokterian: Ion talked about it why there doing druids first because its the most complex class
[4:18:23] Snabido: BrokeBack got that right
[4:18:27] Veegore: Pack Leader:  We really want to expand on the beast theme - now, while in combat and 20 seconds after, when a Pack Leader spec’d hunter spawns a dire beast they will remain out. Allowing a Pack Leader hunter to have up to 20 pets at once. [4:41 AM] I made that up. But imma spread it around like it’s fact, everywhere
[4:18:27] ArcaneSyntax: The paladin ones are Templar, Lighsmith and Herald of the Sun
[4:18:29] sorliee: Yo the shirt he is using is sick, is that merch+
[4:18:31] TheGiant99: Im jealous you got the blizzard cards already
[4:18:32] rbgdev: Where can I watch the deepdive?
[4:18:36] Rhea_the_Cat: @Rhea_the_Cat ok ty :O
[4:18:39] qwerth: yo, just tuning in, thoughts on on worldsoul saga being the last of WOW that transitions us into WOW 2?
[4:18:48] Ferokz: @Veegore lol
[4:18:52] Todmeister9000: it's just 10 more talent points, nothign special
[4:18:53] JasperCalico: @ajaxdh_ i think he is gonna watch it next, but it is also on youtube
[4:19:03] Tharia: nice
[4:19:04] Merqury3: think this was the only mention of the level cap going to 80 funnily enough
[4:19:07] MrWilsonFPS: is this classic or retail related
[4:19:08] MisterPeace: yes please
[4:19:10] MrBr1ghtsid3: Two things need to happen: WoW come to Games Pass and/or GeforceNow & Native controller support. ;)

[4:21:18] Sarocus: Crackbolds
[4:21:20] EvilMalek: You no take candle
[4:21:24] Crimzon7: Question for account wide reps: Will the older reps that you grind doing Dailies. If I do the dailiy quest on 10 characters do I get 10 days of progress on the rep grind or will dailies become only 1 per day per account?
[4:21:26] mavericks312: Give me all of that shit
[4:21:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: i bought mine
[4:21:36] ClassicMalcontent: BOOO no to Cata

[4:22:00] notColt45: It sounds so fun and is out so soon

[4:22:04] mikhaeld277: this is better i feel
[4:22:05] s0trendy: Hey Towlie new tuber do you find it a shame EU and US mix? realms
[4:22:05] Todmeister9000: SoD looks amazing tho
[4:22:05] crawds: @Towelliee is 1-25 going to be slower or just normal classic speed?
[4:22:09] ArcaneSyntax: Classic but more fun to play is exactly what I want
[4:22:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: season of disovery is the closest thing to classic + they gonna get
[4:22:09] herr_iceman: haters gonna hate
[4:22:10] tiyanigean: @Crimzon7 old reps wont be part of the system for a while
[4:22:10] MabusGaming: Which is weird to me because once we hit 60 it's basically classic + and a test for it
[4:22:10] DunzoCD: theres private servers for them
[4:22:11] Krait06: Nerds just mad they didn't call it classic plus
[4:22:11] qualybased: this feels like the start of classic +.  to see what works and what doesnt for real classic +
[4:22:13] kokochris: I love the idea
[4:22:15] Staaxxs: its literally C+ beta
[4:22:16] N3llee: @toobaked1987 some are
[4:22:17] Mickol: Wait classic fans are salty? Would of never guessed
[4:22:17] stallowned: it looks like alot of fun
[4:22:17] DraulTheVikingFox: season of discovery actually has my attention
[4:22:19] JesikaPlays: JesikaPlays subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[4:22:21] rymerre: why even call it classic at this point?
[4:22:22] gho5tfinger: pretty much will be classic+ when they get to level 60 cap, said adding unfinished content and zones
[4:22:27] notColt45: Vocal classic fans have no idea what they want haha
[4:22:28] toobaked1987: Classic fans are excited. Its a beta for Classic Plus
[4:22:29] EvilMalek: I think Classic starts and stops with Hardcore. the stress is so fun
[4:22:34] DarqStalker: im hyped over seaon of discovery over everything else.
[4:22:37] qualybased: how was the radi
[4:22:37] PidiaP: You know if they did Classic+ the Classic players would complain about it not being Classic, Classic+ is a paradox
[4:22:41] qualybased: raid*
[4:22:42] Drakenking: Rogue tank sounds cool
[4:22:42] shavinglove: Level 25 seems low
[4:22:47] CanadianCataclysm: They took that WoW Asension clone and they are doing it in there blizzard fashion by tweaking it to there vision.
[4:22:47] Crimzon7: @tiyanigean but they will eventually be
[4:22:52] Gezber: Pog
[4:22:54] DarqStalker: I'll prob start playing again with season of discovery
[4:22:57] qwerth: its classic plus testing grounds to see what the classic andys will actually want in "official" classic plus
[4:22:59] herr_iceman: its the initial cap
[4:23:00] Krait06: Ret pally actually does damage
[4:23:04] cokodnb: rogue tank LMAO wtf
[4:23:09] Vradek: So do tanks do dmg now?
[4:23:12] ijuki: Mara?
[4:23:17] Lordmann712: scarlet monastery
[4:23:17] DunzoCD: 40 man BRD LUL
[4:23:18] notColt45: Gnomer probably
[4:23:19] flebbooo: they even teased a Kara crypts raid at the end
[4:23:22] hutzika: Scarlet monastery
[4:23:23] macmittens808: Scarlet monastery for sure
[4:23:23] tiyanigean: @Crimzon7 apparently, but I think questions like yours are the exact reason they wont immediately be
[4:23:24] mavericks312: Probably scarlet moon after bfd
[4:23:25] herr_iceman: dual wield enhancement Kreygasm
[4:23:26] scramperlive: if you watch the end of the classic panel deep dive, kara crypts are in the screen shots
[4:23:27] DarqStalker: I like that it's cap 25 for now, give a bite size chuck of wow to focus on, no need to rush to some high level.
[4:23:27] just_laxus: the funniest shit was esfand dc'd in his shaman run for like 2 min and when he reconnected he still had aggro
[4:23:28] CeruleanStar: lvl 40? RFK ?
[4:23:29] MabusGaming: the hinted at gnomeregan, scarlet monastery, and karazhan crypts
[4:23:30] Krait06: They hinted at SM and Kara crypts
[4:23:31] ColdIceCreamMan: they showed Gnomeregan, Scarlet Monastery and Karazhan Crypts
[4:23:33] Gezber: Shadow Bolt
[4:23:34] Zimmygee: Its very obvious they're experimenting with ideas of how to do classic+... why anyone would be salty with that is dumb
[4:23:36] mrwaddles22: they need to make gnome a 40 man raid

[4:32:14] jamarky23: it will evolve into classic plus in due time
[4:32:14] Orthobullet: I think thats where they will go with it after Season of discovery
[4:32:14] razeriel123: they will add new content in class+ on 60
[4:32:15] Yetik: oohhh
[4:32:18] Mr_Arson: Season of discovery is like a like a living ptr where we get to test new stuff together
[4:32:20] N3llee: Yep and that was the viewpoint of many of the classic community
[4:32:22] Deekan33: Also it is a "Season" so wont be forever.
[4:32:24] jure__: Classic + could only happen if they greatly bolster the classic dev team id say
[4:32:24] Fleymour: classic player never getting happy ... because its 20 years ago

[4:32:58] Wcvechten: Atleast they got the classic experience from back when they were children, by complaining like children now
[4:33:04] Snabido: Gotta love those 'nobody/everyone' statements 😏
[4:33:08] N3llee: Its because everyone has a different idea what classic + actually means
[4:33:11] mavericks312: Candies are crying cause they didn’t get there fresh servers
[4:33:14] ArcaneMaki: I don't care what Kungen opinion is, I'm excited for it

[4:34:10] Thoreya: anytime they do a survey, 99% they are doing it
[4:34:13] Maruika: wait people didnt think cata was gonna happen wtf

[4:38:50] Razekichoo: i loved cata..
[4:38:50] Velkhan: Cata is awesome
[4:38:52] ThePawPaw: i started with CATA so im full in
[4:38:54] chefdejour82: PVP was the best

[4:38:54] The_Stogie: or they just want to troll the wrath crybabies
[4:38:54] Sycogenesis: I mean if they didnt ask for it i doubt theyd waste resources

[4:38:55] LegendaryHero20: actually i was one of the people who responded to the survey that said I don't want cata classic
[4:38:55] fetza108: and there are some private servers too with cata
[4:38:55] Rabbi19: also those of us that started in cata wanna relive it too @Towelliee
[4:38:56] LegoCoin: I think players want full progression of all expansions - Rolling expansions on servers over time.

[4:38:58] Herzenliegen: People want Mop so gotta have cata first

[4:38:58] BadgerMan9: I asked, it was the first expac my IRL friends joined me in wow and they still play
[4:39:01] califamadness: cata classic with decent changes is probably going to be the best expension on classic
[4:39:01] Snabido: @Niksen_99 One of us is deaf
[4:39:01] Dyez: og heroics
[4:39:03] draxius34: The talents....

[4:39:07] SensationalBanana: Firelands and Ragnaros HC was amazeballs. People be trippin'
[4:39:08] aesirsghost: Bastion of Twilight is a great raid
[4:39:09] oleohlsen: Ok, between 30 and 40. LUL @rilefors
[4:39:12] Punk611: Cata was ok. The zone revamped sucked and the last 2 fight of the last raid was bad.
[4:39:12] ArcaneMaki: re-tonk
[4:39:13] FoolMonty: loved cata's new zones
[4:39:13] Exoduc: They tried the spine fight once thats why

[4:39:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: 100% true

[4:39:25] Miguel85NYC: Didn't they nerf DK  in Cata
[4:39:26] HatchlingMiquela: Cata was super patchy for me, i moved 3 times and had a baby during it. So my play time was very fragmented
[4:39:27] Amarger: Depends how the survey was worded too
[4:39:27] Giantman407: My Guild was most active during Cata.
[4:39:28] Alisera: i dont think that's true
[4:39:28] SensationalBanana: @Mackplays so is Northrend and WOTLK.
[4:39:31] Etherdon: Hey, another chance to get the pre-patch "Stood in the fire" achievment?
[4:39:32] Putcride: cata for me was the best xpack after 4.2
[4:39:35] smashwow: Cats is in my top 10 of xpacs LUL
[4:39:37] Alisera: i think they HAVE to release Cata to get to MoP which people do want lol

[4:40:23] d1stract10n: i hear no chearing in the croud
[4:40:23] devilhawk83: Cataclysm wasn’t a bad expansion at all though Blizzard nixing Path of the Titans from Cataclysm was a bit of a bummer
[4:40:25] DunzoCD: they should just add all the retail class/race combos att his point lol
[4:40:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: The PvP people really did love Cataclysm

[4:42:59] ClassicMalcontent: I'll only delete if they dont spin up Wrath era options.
[4:42:59] MackPlays: They are just copying over Cata from Chromie retail
[4:42:59] BigMikeBison: already said it
[4:43:00] DunzoCD: @ClassicMalcontent bye

[4:43:33] Molvonos: @ClassicMalcontent They didnt spin up Vanilla/TBC options when LK came out, you're expecting favoritism due to your bias?
[4:43:42] dracullus: they know most people want MoP LUL
[4:43:45] Punk611: I like the slower patch speed. I only play classic between raids in retail.
[4:43:48] Miguel85NYC: I need a computer :(
[4:43:48] ClassicMalcontent: I think Cata Classic is great. For everyone who wants it.
[4:43:51] zelours: Why does it need faster leveling....?

[4:44:03] N3llee: #changes   i hope they nerf druids so we dont see another 25 man all druid world first Nef kill
[4:44:13] Molvonos: @FoolMonty Basically 'Heroic+', with higher difficulty+affixes.
[4:44:19] brimtank: imagine if they unlocked transmog collections account wide so collecting in classic gave you transmogs in retail, or even mounts.
[4:44:22] scramperlive: @FoolMonty LK CLassic's "Mythic Plus" equivalent
[4:44:23] WytChapp: @FoolMonty titan rune dungeons
[4:44:27] infektyd: so faster leveling to reach cata levels, than normal pace for 80-85, thats nice
[4:44:28] herr_iceman: @FoolMonty catch up system in wrath classic, you get previous raid loot so you dont have to do those
[4:44:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Cata Classic is not a replacement for Vanilla, it's a different thing for retail players to enjoy too

[4:52:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: These runes are a game changer
[4:52:18] Hexof: the classic+ people are very picky
[4:52:39] kamuriz: level 25, do the raid level every class to 25 then read guides to find all them secrets :D
[4:52:42] magisterofquelthalas: Better than being revealed when the game is in beta
[4:52:59] Wulfgrym: discovery looks like it will eventaully be classic +
[4:53:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah this is new stuff
[4:53:02] Janigiv: classic+
[4:53:04] XadanarGaming: If mages dont get necromancer spells imma riot... Raise Skeleton
[4:53:04] Nehcrom: I like how they are evolving classic.
[4:53:07] Nightwielder1: I'm honestly excited about it. It's like classic with a mixed up formula
[4:53:07] Deathchampt: I hate this il just be lost
[4:53:12] Nehcrom: Not that I am going to play it :P
[4:53:13] Molvonos: #NotMyClassic+ lol
[4:53:15] oleohlsen: I just asked a friend of mine who never played WoW but is a MMO-lover like me, to check out SoD.
[4:53:19] VarlBGem: If so, that would be great.
[4:53:20] herr_iceman: @XadanarGaming mages gonna be healers LUL
[4:53:23] DunzoCD: i wonder if they wil use like old ironforge and other spots like that
[4:53:25] Shrenko: Turtle wow Kreygasm
[4:53:25] mavericks312: @magisterofquelthalas I mean for like a day or 2 then it will be up on wowhead or mmo champ
[4:53:28] funviking99: Classic players want the wow team to focus on classic rather than modern wow LUL LUL LUL
[4:53:34] MackPlays: The “secrets” will all be on WoW head within 24hrs of release, not first few weeks
[4:53:34] N3llee: My single biggest issues with this Discovery is they are not doing any beta testing etc
[4:53:34] HeatherJC83: i can't play classic bc its so ugly. im weird lol
[4:53:35] Nehcrom: @Molvonos Your memes are off the chart :)
[4:53:36] kamuriz: paladins get taunt :3
[4:53:38] riotinprogress: they need to add retail gfx to classic ;)
[4:53:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: No public testing is a shocker
[4:53:41] Morbid_Axiom_: he called it "classic, plus"
[4:53:41] FoolMonty: classic streamers worried about viewers most likely
[4:53:42] Deathchampt: So copy gta to
[4:53:43] Jadateam: i think people wanted new quests / content but keeping the org characters and abilities
[4:53:45] Molvonos: @Nehcrom lol thanks
[4:53:54] vic_ave: no ptr is great
[4:53:57] illuminity44: I thought general chat was just "Where is Mankriks wife?"
[4:53:58] LegoCoin: So they will have 2 new game versions? Classic - season of discovery and Classic - Cata
[4:53:58] gho5tfinger: datamined
[4:54:06] N3llee: Worry how fucked up the servers are going to be
[4:54:08] ClassicMalcontent: Wish List: If they added a Chromie Time option to just enabled OG game world in Retail (even without flying) would never even touch classic. Perhaps some day.

[4:54:15] Deathchampt: Datamined
[4:54:21] ParzivalMcfly17: I used to be all about classic, but I realize retail WoW is so much better. Constant progression, collecting things, amazing art and animation. I can’t go back to a game that doesn’t have evolve.
[4:54:23] Hexof: i'm all for having a viable specs with the added runes
[4:54:26] DankDirk: Will you do the community night contest next
[4:54:28] AllenzoTV: Plot twist , this is all a public test xD

[4:55:59] Exoduc: esfand covered it, its a beta for classic+
[4:56:00] kamuriz: that launch is going to be crazy! it will probably be queus again :(
[4:56:01] Dontstealmykebabs: basically ascension
[4:56:06] Wulfgrym: paladin taunt incoming
[4:56:22] DankDirk: They should make progression evolve based on average time played,
[4:56:43] Deathchampt: Ye I not doing wow over again
[4:56:44] XanadosX: !drops

[4:56:55] Fazerna: They should do this in retail. 1st patch level cap 73, next 76 etc.
[4:56:57] LegoCoin: yep keeps the elitists in check so doesn't make everyone who works left out. I agree this is good.
[4:57:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: We loved Joyous Journeys
[4:57:07] MackPlays: So are they just locking out everything 25+ or will people try lvl 25 Molten Core
[4:57:10] Krait06: all the classic andies saying exp boost is bad
[4:57:10] DunzoCD: monkaS

[4:57:24] Mandoogles: they are gonna have a version for every persons play style pretty much
[4:57:24] N3llee: WoW is a Cow and they are milking every ounce of it
[4:57:24] Alisera: oh wow
[4:57:27] TheGiant99: Only one is actually new things though
[4:57:29] DunzoCD: NotLikeThis

[4:57:38] fetza108: and people are mad :D

[4:57:49] fewyn: it's insane and it's not gonna stop
[4:57:49] BStrukbyLightning: hey you don't have enough time to play your wow character but here are 5 different wows
[4:57:51] fetza108: WOW IS BACK BABY
[4:57:56] tiyanigean: @AllenzoTV all 5 of them run on the same sub
[4:58:00] Broseidon7624: theyre already printing money with rumble now
[4:58:01] DankDirk: It would be nice to have a new IP
[4:58:01] Drakenking: now everyone can just have what they want
[4:58:02] Outerlaw: LUL
[4:58:04] prophitmoffett: time to by stocks
[4:58:05] Drakenking: its great
[4:58:06] Thewunk: LETS GO
[4:58:07] MikeyGy: and yet doomers are still dooming LuL
[4:58:09] sprert: best part - every version with just on sub
[4:58:09] wolvenhunt: Get u hooked and won't let u go
[4:58:10] starfinder358: 5 its just crazy
[4:58:11] AllenzoTV: LULW
[4:58:14] Wulfgrym: wow killer!
[4:58:22] toobaked1987: I subbed for a year JUST FOR CLASSIC
[4:58:22] Charmmie: towOof
[4:58:25] DankDirk: Titan revvvv up 🆙
[4:58:29] Outerlaw: just imagine when blizzard raises the sub fee
[4:58:30] illuminity44: It is nice that all are on the same sub. I think it'd be a good idea to put WoW on gamepass and as long as you have gamepass you have a WoW sub
[4:58:31] vic_ave: its Blizzard Gamepass
[4:58:33] Deathchampt: I pay my sub even if I’m not playing
[4:58:33] LegoCoin: yep see FANs were right we saved WOW with classic and more subs :-)
[4:58:34] kamuriz: and SF
[4:58:35] LoreBandit: it also splits the player base
[4:58:38] thePegLeg: I'm def subbing for season of discovery i'm excitedc
[4:58:39] EppatTV: Also super good choice for people that wants to play more of them
[4:58:40] Niixten: if classic progress/collection will crossover to retail I will get mad
[4:58:46] Exoduc: and you can play most of them on the wow sub
[4:58:50] Hexof: gamepass for wow would be great
[4:58:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having millions and millions of players overall is freaking awesome, yeah
[4:58:55] yahtzee711: haircut looks good Towelliee
[4:58:58] Hexof: they wont do it though
[4:58:58] Metket: @LoreBandit who cares though
[4:59:03] MsAriez: that's why twitch should open more channles for those hard to find who I wanna watch in one section
[4:59:04] JBarlak: Lol
[4:59:05] MackPlays: And none of the 5 WoW player bases get along
[4:59:12] segarth: Is season of discovery 1 live like hardcore or no?
[4:59:13] tokeruh: finally the wow killer arrived. spoiler, its more wow
[4:59:13] LegoCoin: @Niixten it probably will once they have full progression servers of all expansions
[4:59:14] ArcaneMaki: I'm so happy about season 4 confirmed.
[4:59:23] Deathchampt: Ye add wow to game pass
[4:59:23] RhadigarTV: Josh is my hero! He also has my favorite bands tattoo
[4:59:28] tiyanigean: @LoreBandit plenty of people play either just one version- and wouldnt play at all if it didnt exist, or play several versions and onl yone of them ""seriously""
[4:59:28] herr_iceman: @segarth no its normal wow not hc
[4:59:29] ClassicMalcontent: Give me Retail with Chromie time old world nostalgia option and I'd be set. Glad some enjoy classic but I just miss the old world.
[4:59:31] JBarlak: Meh
[4:59:36] macmittens808: I think they'll put wow on gamepass but it'll be more expensive than the normal one, probably working out the details
[4:59:38] Exoduc: mechanic easy yes but statwise less so, in the spirit of vanilla
[4:59:39] DunzoCD: is any classic boss hard mechanically?
[4:59:40] illuminity44: If they added WoW to Xbox PC Game pass and the sub tied to that... i think WoW would get a  LOT of new players
[4:59:46] segarth: @ledotz ok ty
[4:59:48] asthelegendgoes: this is going to get most of my limited gametime each week
[4:59:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: New loot is a big thing
[4:59:52] CordovaGC: Me personally I'm beyond excited for cata! Towelliees new world order 2.0?
[4:59:56] ThaOriginalGamester: i love lamp
[5:00:02] Molvonos: https://i.imgur.com/duvFdoi.jpg @Towelliee
[5:00:05] JBarlak: Lol redesign so it’s not classic then
[5:00:06] MackPlays: WoW has too many abilities for consoles
[5:00:07] Outerlaw: LUL
[5:00:07] Wulfgrym: LUL
[5:00:09] BStrukbyLightning: i only play mmo's for the loot
[5:00:10] PvtHudson093: pvpe pass
[5:00:11] SSD511_: KEKWlaugh
[5:00:14] mavericks312: @illuminity44 they lose money so that’s not gonna happen
[5:00:21] 07biby: the lowbie gankers Kappa
[5:00:22] MackPlays: They’d need to fit all the abilities on a controller
[5:00:23] Wulfgrym: its classic + KEKW
[5:00:26] herr_iceman: pvpers trying to kill the pve faction boss LUL
[5:00:27] asthelegendgoes: hell yes
[5:00:29] Nightwielder1: sounds cool
[5:00:31] asthelegendgoes: write us a new story
[5:00:31] kh0nan: @mackplays ffxiv works fine and I have more keybinds than wow
[5:00:32] SpoofAvatar: lower karazhan
[5:00:32] AllenzoTV: Hyjal Pog
[5:00:33] gho5tfinger: thats the classic+ part
[5:00:34] illuminity44: @mavericks312 No they dont Blizzard = Microsoft.... price of gamepass is same as a WoW sub
[5:00:37] kamuriz: Raid on GM island please!
[5:00:38] asthelegendgoes: @Wulfgrym yep, y oure 2 days late
[5:00:49] MackPlays: @kh0nan doubt
[5:00:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Just the first step, pog
[5:00:52] Hexof: ret pally for me
[5:00:55] Molvonos: @illuminity44 That's incorrect.  It would be a net loss, because the WoW token exists.
[5:00:59] mavericks312: Rogue tank ftw
[5:01:01] Broseidon7624: definitely doing shaman and lock tank
[5:01:02] herr_iceman: would love to see a warlock tank
[5:01:02] asthelegendgoes: warlock tank going to go crazy
[5:01:05] biirrd: ret paladin will be so broaken
[5:01:06] ArcaneMaki: 100%
[5:01:07] limburgse: 100%
[5:01:08] KingTarro: PROT PALLY
[5:01:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot paladin needed a taunt
[5:01:10] SpoofAvatar: and crusader strike
[5:01:10] prophitmoffett: LETS GO!
[5:01:13] MrKhanes: You could have 2 chars :)

[5:39:07] Hammerify: I'm upset
[5:39:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: it does say that no weekly things can be done in the 3 days
[5:39:12] Masqerader: so its not like its not a big deal
[5:39:15] Velkhan: I dont see the giveaway section
[5:39:15] ThaOriginalGamester: they're already crying on reddit
[5:39:17] Celestia6: Theres a lot of people on twitter upset about it
[5:39:19] Hammerify: Professions and market stuff effected by 3 days of access
[5:39:20] mavericks312: its not like endgame stuff is open those 3 days or anything
[5:39:22] N3llee: One thing I am not happy about. $90 bundle and 3 head start
[5:39:30] Allexi88: You literally can't do weeklies or mythic 0's for those 3 days, so it really doesn't matter
[5:39:30] VarlBGem: I seldom do the betas other than to pop in and say ooo pretty.

[5:40:19] Fleymour: profession / goldmaking .. can be millions @Towelliee
[5:40:20] AjaxGamingTTV: @bunta80 D4 did the same thing before Microsoft buying Blizzard
[5:40:23] zeitgeiz: Bad thing is the 3 day access is more important for the people with less time to play
[5:40:23] theDirtyon3: the extra pay foir that extra 50 bucks for sure
[5:40:25] xziyn: The real issue is if you can't afford the 90$ version and some of your friends can, so you'll have to watch them play while you wait
[5:40:27] ursinealli: $115 CDN lawl
[5:40:31] Karn1987: d4 was more
[5:40:39] just_laxus: it is kinda expensive but they at least keep adding stuff to make it worth
[5:40:40] Trobbels: !discord
[5:40:45] LorienV: Okay with the price, but the 3 day early access is weird. Not like this is Diablo.
[5:40:45] Molvonos: People're freaking out, saying they're paying $90 for 3 days early access and completely forgetting everything else that comes with it, that's been available for years previously.
[5:40:45] Nehcrom: Man I bought the epic one straight away and also renewed my 1 year sub :P
[5:40:46] Antoinas: 424 gear is nice
[5:40:46] Mckhero: ele shaman or rogue... c ant decide
[5:40:51] Arbszy: @ursinealli it is 130 with tax included.
[5:40:52] zeitgeiz: 424? Wow
[5:40:53] TheGiant99: @xziyn so what
[5:40:57] N3llee: $90 bundle never did anything but xmog mounts, etc which more cosmetic stuff.
[5:40:58] Nehcrom: So GL all.
[5:40:59] Drakenking: ye
[5:40:59] Masqerader: level 70 boost

[5:41:05] chulklol: a month
[5:41:07] RolexKT: Yea one month
[5:41:09] CatsRusOfficial: Gear is nice. But I suppose  that wiht the gaming going to 460+ it makes sense
[5:41:09] theDirtyon3: 1000 tendies too
[5:41:09] TweektheProphet: or no 30 days
[5:41:11] Jaqhuir: 424? that is really nice
[5:41:11] Broomba: yes
[5:41:13] Antoinas: + the tendies they give u
[5:41:14] geokouts: GoodLuck everyone on the giveaway :)
[5:41:16] Nehcrom: 1000 tenders!
[5:41:20] Ronangic: 424 is more gear than my main, i;m pretty sure KEKW
[5:41:20] RolexKT: The pet + sub time makes up the cost increase
[5:41:21] DamaarDK: @Towelliee  does the renown increase also open on ur main if u boost with epic edition ?
[5:41:26] xziyn: @TheGiant99 Me, I don't care at all, but I can see the argument
[5:41:26] wasserhammer: I'm just waiting to find out if there will be a physical collectors edition
[5:41:27] Masqerader: 1 month and a level 70 boost
[5:41:28] Hammerify: I'm cool with everything BUT the Early Access being limited

[5:42:00] PojaLive: The early release is the only problem
[5:42:01] Celestia6: The mount is so gorgeous, and I love how it is customizable
[5:42:01] Alliewh33lz: So it's worth it
[5:42:01] ThaOriginalGamester: less than a day of work
[5:42:05] NYKO7_: boost is 60$ alone
[5:42:05] nostreamerstream: true
[5:42:06] duhworks: beta is worth 20 bucks ngl
[5:42:09] GodKingMuninn: Also anyone who complains about tendies i'm gonna hit you with a fucking brick - 1k tendies came with DF purchase too :D
[5:42:13] Nehcrom: Been playing WoW since launch brought me tons of fun, will always be worth it to me. Also I can afford it.
[5:42:15] PidiaP: I like telling people the Hearthstone Epic Pre-expansion bundles are $80 and they do 3 a year
[5:42:16] Arbszy: After the Ws from Blizzcon it is worth it.
[5:42:17] NickLeonhearth: I'm gonna buy it with gold like always so i don't care :D
[5:42:20] Masqerader: @Towelliee people also forget u pay for it over time so u can take ur time and pay for it too
[5:42:22] VarlBGem: $90 is pretty cheap really.
[5:42:26] Xanctius: The beta access is weird
[5:42:29] CatsRusOfficial: Drives more sales to the higher version.
[5:42:31] Mystai: How do you enter?
[5:42:32] Herzenliegen: Yep,lol
[5:42:32] Fleymour: 500 tenders more = 5$ ?
[5:42:33] brentosxd: yeah thats fucked up
[5:42:33] HoppsiDejsi: Me litrually only buying these things for the mounts
[5:42:35] just_laxus: because i have add and cannot wait those 3 additional days
[5:42:35] BigMikeBison: 3 day access mean i can slow play up to my vacation lol
[5:42:37] zeitgeiz: Yeah the Cata is pathetic
[5:42:40] Nehcrom: Like towel says if you cannot afford to pay your rent.. perhaps not play online games that cost money.
[5:42:42] tebbix: wait what
[5:42:42] itsDets: do you know if ppl who got inv to beta for DF(by Blizz) gonna get beta for TWW or is it random-ish? @Towelliee
[5:42:42] N3llee: Its an Activision move not a Blizz reincarnation Micro move.

[5:42:53] Hitokiri83: I think they put in the early access in is because other games have done it recently
[5:42:53] Merex760: Should be 60 lol

[5:44:45] ClassicMalcontent: Enjoy it! Won't be joining. Glad they enjoy it. Apparently as a group they matter. I think enough would pay to remain. I'll pay to transfer to a Wrath only server.

[5:45:51] Broomba: @towelliee soda is running Only Fangs like a general -- very strict
[5:45:52] Fleymour: KEKW
[5:45:53] the_dayquill: OnlyFangs is a Cult for sure, but its a pretty cool cult i think
[5:45:55] Featherbow: @LinkmizteR it's a guild name.
[5:45:56] Sycogenesis: @tebbix i can see that
[5:45:57] fetza108: yes
[5:45:59] AveragePvp: Discovery is going to be so sick

[5:46:23] mavericks312: i have 0 interest in classic era but SoD im down for
[5:46:28] fetza108: but what some classic players say sod is retail KEKWlaugh
[5:46:35] sacrifixion: classic isn't cannon
[5:46:36] zeitgeiz: @towelliee the only thing left for them to do now is let you run a retail client AND a classic client. Would have played classic more if I could have done that
[5:46:43] LadineL337: Im gonna try a class I have never tried before which would be rog or warrior
[5:46:43] OldDraenor: What we need is classic fresh, not sod :)
[5:46:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I believe it
[5:46:50] Sycogenesis: I just wanted to experience the glory days of Windfurry Shamsn again
[5:46:51] OldDraenor: SeemsGood

[5:47:23] Krysarith: @Towelliee Is OnlyFangs Streamer Only or open membership?
[5:47:42] GodKingMuninn: instead of Dinar they could just double the amount of loot that drops :)
[5:47:53] KyleEverett: 10.2 being months longer than 9.2 is such a massive L for me.
[5:48:11] NiteshadezTV: All TW dungeons are a joke anyways, I don't get the "no classic TW dungeons" thing
[5:48:14] Affiiance: FIX MONKS!
[5:48:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Reducing button bloat is good
[5:48:22] asthelegendgoes: yeah 10.2 gunna last 2x longer than any patch this season
[5:48:33] mavericks312: @KyleEverett were literally getting a fated season what are you on about
[5:48:44] Thoreya: pog
[5:48:53] notColt45: The pvp gearing is another "finally!"
[5:49:11] tebbix: yeah same
[5:49:14] notColt45: Yeah same
[5:49:14] Arbszy: Spiritborn
[5:49:16] valianya: PvP gearing faster and deterministic
[5:49:17] N3llee: D4 fireside chat was a huge let down
[5:49:18] Wulfgrym: the diablo 4 campfire was a total disaster
[5:49:18] Sycogenesis: Lol bro i kept telling you  Crusader was pure hopium
[5:49:19] Scoodles91: priest
[5:49:20] futomara01: d4 they said fucking almost nothing
[5:49:20] KyleEverett: @mavericks312 Fated is not real content, if 10.2 was the same length 9.2 was we'd be getting prepatch in July.
[5:49:26] rymerre: good...tired of diablo just using the same shit over and over
[5:49:28] TheGiant99: I got both
[5:49:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: now if they do an early access edition of d4 expansion when its the start of a new season that could be an issue
[5:49:35] Alisera: lol i need that shirt
[5:49:36] Crawlern: Hold up. there is a sword ?
[5:49:37] Merex760: They'll probably add Paladin like they did Necromancer in D3 as DLC
[5:49:42] notColt45: I wasn't expecting much from D4 this blizzcon though so a trailer was something
[5:49:42] ScalarGaming: trueeeeeee
[5:49:44] Kneckt: they havent shipped my hockey jersey from 10 days ago
[5:49:45] Sycogenesis: it always does
[5:49:45] limburgse: 100%
[5:49:48] Celestia6: Yeah it did
[5:49:50] mavericks312: @KyleEverett were still getting a 10.2.5 and a 10.2.7
[5:49:51] ChildishAnbu: they could bring another class down the road like they did with necromancer with D3
[5:49:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: this was a WoWcon
[5:49:53] ScalarGaming: imagine being an overwatch fan
[5:49:57] NickLeonhearth: Well Overwatch 2 and D4 were already poop so...
[5:49:59] Molvonos: @KyleEverett Man, I love imaginary content I don't play, don't get proper gear for, don't get achievements for, and don't get to enjoy with my raid.
[5:50:02] DunzoCD: metzen got a bigger pop than phil lol
[5:50:03] Rudric_Ice: it was a WoWcon
[5:50:06] valianya: Fated is going to be Epilogue story and bridge to 11
[5:50:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: It made sense that WoW was last in the opening ceremony, yep
[5:50:10] Wulfgrym: they have given next to no info on d4 expansion
[5:50:10] asthelegendgoes: OW was so underwhelming
[5:50:11] xmedpakx: WoW needed a much larger area represented at blizzcon imo
[5:50:11] dhavocdh: sound nothing about starcraft 2
[5:50:12] KyleEverett: @mavericks312 Those aren't raids or dungeons.
[5:50:12] Molvonos: The fuck is 'real content'.  Fated is 'real' content, get out of here.
[5:50:12] Moobot: LEAK SEASON HAS STARTED https://www.wowhead.com/news/avaloren-expansion-leak-for-world-of-warcraft-11-0-335727
[5:50:12] Menion01: Diablo 4's presentation was ass.
[5:50:13] limburgse: the rest of the games the room was pretty quit, when WoW was announced, the roof blew off :P
[5:50:14] dhavocdh: sad
[5:50:14] Sycogenesis: Hot Take 90% of ppl go for Wow
[5:50:15] segarth: That’s mostly because of blizzard shitting on their other IPs
[5:50:16] rymerre: sad there was no heroes of the storm
[5:50:16] mavericks312: the new OW hero isnt that impressive tbh
[5:50:17] Masqerader: I don't know how they didn't add crusader, it's like one of the most iconic lore classes in Diablo
[5:50:20] NiteshadezTV: @mavericks312 Not the same lol
[5:50:20] timmehsee: I'm back playing wow after neraly 4 years away all because of what was announced + Metzen
[5:50:22] prophitmoffett: WoWCon

[5:50:43] PidiaP: They really messed up the floor layout doing two Overwatch halls and one Warcraft floor for all the Warcraft universe games
[5:50:44] PvtHudson093: Daddy Metzen is home
[5:50:48] Sycogenesis: Ever since SC got burried

[5:50:55] cothxd: the hearthstone panel was so sad and quiet
[5:50:56] mavericks312: @NiteshadezTV sure not the same as a new raid but log on during that time and you will see those fated raids flooded
[5:50:56] gassygatinho: How tall is imfiredup @towelliee
[5:50:59] GodKingMuninn: Diablo peeps are basement dwellers we don't leave house
[5:51:00] prophitmoffett: Whats starcraft?
[5:51:00] notColt45: They don't have phones Kappa
[5:51:01] Masqerader: Metzen getting pops like he was stone cold
[5:51:08] Affiiance: I think Im going to go the next time it rolls around
[5:51:15] limburgse: i loved it when Metzen came up <3

[5:52:17] valianya: At most they should stop after Legion.
[5:52:18] kennyrip7: cata classic just doesnt make sense, "classic" so always be prior to cata world change

[5:53:04] Wulfgrym: they said nothing
[5:53:05] Menion01: It sucked
[5:53:05] DunzoCD: nope nothing KEKW
[5:53:06] Masqerader: It's all fun and games until you get to spine of deathwing
[5:53:09] Celestia6: It was mostly stuff about the christmas event
[5:53:09] RolexKT: Yea the campfire was mostly just repeating stuff we heard
[5:53:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: it was mostly season 2 stuff coming in a few weeks
[5:53:12] Veegore: very broad general infomation
[5:53:17] valianya: Talked about expansion
[5:53:24] N3llee: Of all things to build off the hype of S2 they could have dropped bangers for S3 but failed miserably.
[5:53:25] futomara01: expac is obviously far from ready
[5:53:33] VarlBGem: I wonder what happens with the campfire if you have 50 alts.
[5:53:36] Drakenking: yes
[5:53:39] Veegore: yes
[5:53:40] Miguel85NYC: @towelliee was there a Q&A panel?
[5:53:43] Zansepharos: Zansepharos subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 78 months!

[5:53:46] mavericks312: think they said interviews will be this coming week and further
[5:53:46] Masqerader: the q/a will be released later
[5:53:47] Wrizzik: @Towelliee I just want Cata so I can try out that bug again to Prospect ore and vendor to goldcap
[5:53:53] VarlBGem: Could get crowded.
[5:53:55] billybaggens: preach did no?
[5:53:57] menzo1337: I wonder if they’ll have the guild stuff in Cara. Have Group Will Travel was awesome
[5:53:59] N3llee: @Towelliee Seems like they did interviews but they havent dropped. Preach teased one on twitter with ion.
[5:54:01] Veegore: not video just text
[5:54:03] valianya: Talked about D4 expansion and the two seasonal events this year
[5:54:03] coldhandsbeatz: Warcraft Wiki, Wowhead has an exclusive one, Icy Veins
[5:54:04] TheGiant99: Ions deep dive is the best
[5:54:06] coldhandsbeatz: No videos
[5:54:09] TweektheProphet: from what i could tell they were waiting till next week then releaseing a Q&A video
[5:54:46] coldhandsbeatz: Wowhead does have an exclusive interview. Its just not on video, only text. I think is that one
[5:55:08] mavericks312: bro midnight could legit drop mid 2025
[5:55:31] CrowMomocle: Seems we can't buy the What Sword shirt in the EU shop :(
[5:55:41] MrWoodsmith: Midnight prolly going come out early 2026
[5:55:46] kronospally19: Still not a fan of waiting a year with having a season of fated. rather just have a 18 month expansion cycle
[5:55:47] Snabido: Account wide battle pets > hunter pets Kappa
[5:55:56] asthelegendgoes: @Pantelijus no one knows yet, i'm betting on a COD release schedule
[5:55:57] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[5:55:58] Sycogenesis: My guesstimate is to have the last titan by 2028
[5:55:59] Wulfgrym: going to wait to see what metzen says
[5:56:01] TheGiant99: Are the warbands cross server....
[5:56:01] chocobobo16: I think it's great that Midnight is patch 12.0
[5:56:02] NiteshadezTV: Midnight is 2026, end of year most likely.
[5:56:04] mavericks312: or rather mid 2026
[5:56:09] gho5tfinger: well they said getting expansions faster than we used to
[5:56:09] kennyrip7: if we get war within early early 2024, midnight might come late 2025
[5:56:09] MrGrimms: They said that the 3 expansions are taking us to 2030... so doubt that early
[5:56:13] Greencaps07: wouldnt they want to announce the new expansion at each blizzcon
[5:56:13] GroovyBryan: IDK How they are going to fit all my alts on that warband screen. Lol
[5:56:16] necralia: no they are not
[5:56:25] DunzoCD: midnight would be Q2 2026 prolly
[5:56:26] Wulfgrym: metzen did say they are planning to change how content comes out from how we are used to
[5:56:26] icerasta: YEah that would be super spoiler if they did that
[5:56:27] RolexKT: Late 2024 iirc
[5:56:27] scumlucki: @GroovyBryan its probably gonna be a select few
[5:56:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Fall 2024
[5:56:29] Kneckt: it says on or before dec 31
[5:56:30] RolexKT: Nothign else
[5:56:32] Kneckt: so could be anuythoing
[5:56:32] mavericks312: i wonder how much "faster" is faster
[5:56:33] Greencaps07: before dec 31 2024
[5:56:34] PojaLive: Just fall
[5:56:35] illuminity44: @GroovyBryan You arent supposed to fit them all, just your favorites
[5:56:36] Starblaster_1: Just Fall
[5:56:36] duhworks: every 2 year i though
[5:56:38] WSilverHawkW: just Fall 2024
[5:56:38] motorboatingpro: it feels like it'll fall into 3 seasons per xpack and they'll use the fated season 4 if they need extra time
[5:56:39] ursinealli: just a screen that said Fall
[5:56:39] j_hooligan: Well if they step up the time table we could see it next year
[5:56:40] Rottencoarse: it only said fall 2024 @Towelliee
[5:56:40] asthelegendgoes: @GroovyBryan they said your most played characters across all realms..and only saw 4...so
[5:56:41] COGBLOCKERR: it was fall 2024
[5:56:41] Arbszy: Late Fall is the usual WoW release so Oct/Nov/Dec
[5:56:43] JumpTroopC5: If it’s part of one big story how could it not be spoilers
[5:56:46] matx83: Just said Fall 2024 there was no later or earlyt
[5:56:47] Masqerader: sept 21st ish
[5:56:49] oradros: 20 sept to dec 2
[5:56:51] Kneckt: it just a placeholder date imo
[5:56:52] TopherAllen: Fall 2024 on screen...terms in pre-purchase Dec 31
[5:56:54] Sycogenesis: "we don't want to have your grandchildren controlling the mouse trying to wrap this story up"
[5:56:55] oradros: dec 20
[5:56:55] chazemoto: someone said every 12 months a new xpac
[5:56:56] kennyrip7: @GroovyBryan  i think we will get 5 around the fire that we can choose, then the others in the menu, like the picture
[5:56:56] asthelegendgoes: they said 10.2 was coming in fall and we're getting it now in november
[5:57:01] Krysarith: They said that the Worldsoul Saga would go to 2030 so your looking at The War Within 2024 / Midnight 2026 / The Last Titan 2028
[5:57:06] menzo1337: Their goal has always been 18 months between each xpac.
[5:57:09] Aidler: the entire story will be finished after 2030
[5:57:13] Zyvuun: Blizzard is saying on or before Dec 31,2024
[5:57:23] hypexsauce_: 46 STARTING to sound old when talk about 2030 dam it geezzz
[5:57:24] KPable: are they going to change how Renown is gained in DF in 10.2?
[5:57:28] coldhandsbeatz: almost whole year between 10.2 and 11.0 is crazy. we will have more story content but no dungeons raids etc is kinda crazy
[5:57:29] wickedmgg: they said story done by 2030. so xpac still gonna last 2 years
[5:57:36] GodKingMuninn: October 8th 2024 - best fits launch date for War Within
[5:57:36] Thoreya: midnight is gonna be a banger
[5:57:36] Valo916: Valo916 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[5:57:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: probably 11.1 trailer and info at best
[5:57:39] TialePetit: @Zyvuun that is a placeholder date so they can activate pre orders.
[5:57:49] Nightmareo: The placeholder release date for cata classic on the store page says august 2024
[5:57:53] Snabido: @coldhandsbeatz First time? KKona
[5:57:55] mavericks312: @Kaapp_ why would they change it, its fine as is
[5:57:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I expect 2 year cycles
[5:57:59] SlipusSly: i was thinking 1.5yr
[5:58:04] sacrifixion: I think we're in the final years of retail and maybe wow 2 comes next
[5:58:05] Tambandia: Rather they just have the extra time to get shit done right
[5:58:06] NiteshadezTV: I mean they said this saga is set to expand to 2030 soo.. 1 year between them makes no sense
[5:58:07] rymerre: 2 years is probably it
[5:58:07] j_hooligan: I think it will be 18 to 20 month cycle
[5:58:08] Nuvene: they did say they were going to come out faster than the normal
[5:58:09] coldhandsbeatz: @wickedmgg I dont think thats the wording. I got the sense of it being well finished and done before 2030

[6:17:48] kokochris: im really looking forward to this feature
[6:17:48] Calphurnious: The whole of Azeroth being red, glowing and cracking is a little concerning though
[6:18:01] JumpTroopC5: My friends and I still run islands
[6:18:04] wreckshoptv: could the new dwarfs be horde too?
[6:18:05] Molvonos: @herzlustafir Its an allied race, which most allied races are 'recolors'.

[6:20:14] herr_iceman: like lost sectors in destiny 2
[6:20:16] WundertueteGER: delve sounds sick PogChamp
[6:20:19] herzlustafir: @Molvonos ofc there is some expectations going in to a new expantion! it looks great! just a little disappointed. expected more..
[6:20:28] JeemTeam: @Towelliee what tank you raiding with in 10.2?
[6:20:29] AlphasaurusRexx: also looks like he's talking from a place of knowledge instead of reading a prompt
[6:20:32] Tambandia: This is gonna be so big for keeping the open world alive
[6:20:34] Moobot: THE new wireless Scimitar and Virtuoso Pro Open Back Headset now available! towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee
[6:20:43] VarlBGem: So are delves instances? Can other people come in after I enter?
[6:20:45] TheGiant99: Its awesome they are solo as well as group
[6:20:45] PidiaP: Sloot reinvents himself as a mythic delve streamer Kappa
[6:21:13] DunzoCD: im sure there will be some good side stories with these for more lore content
[6:21:13] GodKingMuninn: Delve to World First
[6:21:14] kokochris: super cool
[6:21:15] Effin_Steffin: Retail players gonna be eatin good!
[6:21:15] herzlustafir: im making one for sure
[6:21:16] Molvonos: @herzlustafir Unsure what more you could expect, tbh.  It's a Neutral Allied race, we havent seen what their mount is, their racials, etc.  Were you expecting a brand new race for an allied race?
[6:21:23] Rudric_Ice: im confused so how is it outdoor when it is instanced ?
[6:21:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: i hate doing mythic + so im loving this
[6:21:31] LorienV: Sounds like the Trust system
[6:21:36] kokochris: yup
[6:21:36] duhMarSeeYa: ESO too
[6:21:37] Niixten: imagine having Magni as a companion follow you around LUL
[6:21:42] Dauphim: as a healer that usually plays solo, that's huge
[6:21:42] scumlucki: @Rudric_Ice no loading scream so iits outdoor
[6:21:43] Calphurnious: @VarlBGem Pretty sure it's based off who is in your party and not like in ESO
[6:21:43] Artful_Dodger: Or WoD
[6:21:44] Uttv32: Wasn't Brann saying he was retiering in DF ?
[6:21:44] CreativeMikeMedia: esop
[6:21:48] CreativeMikeMedia: eso*
[6:21:51] mrniceguy817: Kind of did in legion but very basic
[6:21:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah you can make them a tank or healer, it's very convenient
[6:21:58] Ezekyler: what will be cool is with the Warband an alt be your companion @Towelliee
[6:21:59] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!

[6:22:01] kyotoboss: @Niixten The Wounds Champion !!
[6:22:01] WundertueteGER: yea
[6:22:02] Caedranos: @Niixten You are wooooounded champion, I must heal thee!
[6:22:02] AlphasaurusRexx: @VarlBGem it's instanced, but it's done in a way that there is no loading screen, similar to Destiny 2 lost sectors you run through a cave or corridor that acts as the loading screen to make it seamless
[6:22:07] metallicv12: guild wars 1 had that with companions i loved it
[6:22:10] Destro421: @towelliee how does the “bad luck protection” work for the 2H legendary?
[6:22:22] dinomiyte: do we get in game shit on retail for preordering classic?
[6:22:28] LGilbert1982: This reminds me of a mix of maps and varient dungeons in FFXIV, but I know a lot of these ideas are built from many diff games as well as their own history.
[6:22:33] VarlBGem: ty @AlphasaurusRexx That would be sweet
[6:22:33] kokochris: fucking dark souls fog door danS
[6:22:41] GodKingMuninn: can't wait for the double 2x4 delve groups farming those places
[6:22:41] Rudric_Ice: @Lucki8Fentynl so kinda like dark souls before bosses ?
[6:22:42] liviu_81: yeah, just don t   make it so you become his companion, much stronger than you
[6:22:51] scumlucki: @Rudric_Ice basically
[6:23:07] SpidercowSD: POE Delve

[6:23:32] MOLAR305: Ion rocking sketchers in his old age?
[6:23:34] kokochris: so if you go into a delve, with 1 other person; can both of you bring your companion ?
[6:23:48] kokochris: loll
[6:24:00] AlphasaurusRexx: @Rudric_Ice yeah
[6:24:02] SpidercowSD: @Towelliee  M+ Candle King is going to be "LIT"

[6:24:15] herzlustafir: @Molvonos what i expect is not relevant i get what they are doing... but after all pandas and dragons... and foxes....
[6:24:15] chocobobo16: Justice for Kolbolds xD
[6:24:17] liviu_81: current arm wrestling champion
[6:24:33] Molvonos: ok
[6:24:34] irishwhiskey__: Sometimes they ARE out to get you and your candle
[6:24:36] kokochris: that kobald was pumping iron waiting for the day you show up
[6:24:38] Dcarter: Sketchers are actually great shows for lots of walking
[6:24:42] acklesdh: hopefully there's a lot of variability in the delves
[6:24:47] Dcarter: We used to wear them when I worked in the watbiuse
[6:24:51] Dcarter: Warehouse
[6:24:51] GodKingMuninn: Its nice seeing wow going back to what they do best - steal what others do and do it better.
[6:24:59] JasperCalico: @GodKingMuninn this
[6:25:12] itsCloaker: those are adidas w/ the 3 stripes
[6:25:16] irishwhiskey__: my sketcher work shoes still look nice after a decade
[6:25:20] Artful_Dodger: @GodKingMuninn True.
[6:25:21] Calphurnious: @MOLAR305 Is there an S logo, 3 lines looks like addidas to me
[6:25:28] Rudric_Ice: i hope delves doesn't have a "Timer" cuz that would be dumb
[6:25:30] Aidler: maybe they took some elements from visions
[6:25:35] Molvonos: Some of ya'll perpetual negatives are starting to get old.
[6:25:37] VarlBGem: I hope they use the cool gold piles you can find in the Forgotten Reaches vault.
[6:25:41] kokochris: 13 total right away
[6:25:43] Astaris: I will say this Blizzcon has done a great job of drawing me back in to play lol
[6:25:43] DunzoCD: they said 13 right?
[6:25:43] donkunn: 13
[6:25:44] kyotoboss: 13 different ?
[6:25:46] bunta80: 12 and secret 13 apparently
[6:25:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: 13 unique delves
[6:25:50] Molvonos: It's one thing to have criticism, but holy shit.
[6:25:51] Blankelos: think he told 13
[6:25:52] fistofnature: i hope its simular to the withered army training, that was fun
[6:25:57] chulklol: 13
[6:25:57] ssbmang: Wow classic + our only hope
[6:25:58] valianya: 13 delve locations
[6:25:58] Nebulizer87: They said 12 1 secret so 13
[6:26:00] Karn1987: hi @Molvonos
[6:26:03] kokochris: yup could be different
[6:26:09] Molvonos: @Karn1987 Eyyyy
[6:26:11] Threhn: 13 delve locations, but it sounds like multiple permutations exist
[6:26:13] Greencaps07: probably only 3-4 types on delve over the 13 locations
[6:26:13] Ch0p_Su3y: 12 known.. 13th hidden.. at least 4 modes for each
[6:26:18] Nebulizer87: I think they are curated not procedural
[6:26:22] WundertueteGER: jumping puzzles etc. Prayge
[6:26:25] kokochris: shroom delve danK
[6:26:32] starfinder358: 12 1 hidden
[6:26:39] AlphasaurusRexx: it's probably something akin to dungeoneering in runescape. can increase the difficulty
[6:26:43] Aidler: jumping puzzle
[6:26:52] WSilverHawkW: There are 13 Delve locations and they will have unique map, but content in them can be random
[6:26:56] herzlustafir: the only negative i found.. everything else is amazing... chat will be chat tho
[6:27:23] Derca_: KEKW
[6:27:27] kyotoboss: The Dread Pit is Torghast 2.0 LUL
[6:27:28] Broseidon7624: better be a cow delve
[6:27:28] Snabido: *datamine he means Kappa
[6:27:28] Molvonos: @herzlustafir Yea, that wasn't directed at you.  I was honestly curious what you might have wanted/expected.

[6:37:34] Mecabeast: 98 slots by default
[6:37:35] DreamSweet: Heck yeaa
[6:37:36] Masqerader: now they just need an auto sort to guild banks and more tabs

[6:38:38] JAG19d: @towelliee any guess how many alts you can have in your warband?
[6:38:43] notColt45: They gonna do it no matter what

[6:38:50] GodKingMuninn: I laugh cause the liquid people are gonna fuck themselves so hard with this LOL
[6:38:51] Greencaps07: its lower ilvl then it normally would drop
[6:38:52] Aidler: how is it different from account bound?
[6:38:52] BoezIRL: @JAG19d all of them
[6:38:55] BlinkHeals: Its really just BOA gear same think maybe just more drops than just catch up gear

[6:39:56] Sarocus: I personally have absolutely zero craps to give about what Method and those guys do
[6:39:56] Greencaps07: how when its lower ivl then normally would drop
[6:40:04] BlinkHeals: ITS BOA items and they said personal drops @Towelliee
[6:40:12] AvrithSATX: It a new type of gear, not just any item drop.
[6:40:13] madbombz_fth: prob bonus loot
[6:40:14] BoezIRL: no
[6:40:15] DunzoCD: they said it will be bonus loot
[6:40:16] honeychonker: It's extra personal loot
[6:40:17] CatsRusOfficial: @Towelliee I am worried about those gold makers with crafting  on Warbands
[6:40:17] Brutefiend: it will be its own thing
[6:40:17] Cituen: not sure
[6:40:19] jarilrpg: he said its personal extra drops @Towelliee

[6:40:22] biirrd: no
[6:40:25] Metket: you get no loot and instead you get warbound i guess
[6:40:25] lesley2280: i THINK IT WILL SAY wARBOUND
[6:40:27] bunta80: No just certain items. BoA non-tradable.
[6:40:27] Broseidon7624: probably any bop item
[6:40:27] BoezIRL: they are extra gear
[6:40:28] Krysarith: Its going to be its own version of a Raid BOE
[6:40:28] CanadianCataclysm: Its a extra bonus personal loot drop
[6:40:30] prophitmoffett: like chest gear
[6:40:31] TweektheProphet: I think it will be like soul bound or BOE, it will be a new option
[6:40:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: its like those things you use to consume and it made an item
[6:40:32] valianya: Warbound is personal loot outside boss loot
[6:40:33] JAG19d: @boezirl  I watched this deep dive, they didn’t confirm all alts. In fact he specified renown is only shared by alts in your warband implying it won’t be all
[6:40:35] Zivs: will be interesting to see
[6:40:37] VarlBGem: same as account bound really.
[6:40:37] Subjektive: they are lower ilvl also
[6:40:39] biirrd: no its a new type of loot
[6:40:41] allisonkielle: It's a gear from an insance that drops as warbound so it can be a raid piece
[6:40:54] AvrithSATX: It's extra gear, lower iLvL, designed to give to alower level alts.
[6:40:55] Angryfist40: what sword
[6:40:58] MisterBongwater: It does seem like that could taper off yeah
[6:40:59] jarilrpg: nah, that is catch up gear
[6:40:59] Metket: they should
[6:41:01] mavericks312: yea i think those catch up events maybe every other patch
[6:41:01] 5rsetko: NOPE
[6:41:02] Wcvechten: they'll probably use that to get you that warbound gear

[6:41:16] Molvonos: kk
[6:41:17] SMRyan: the thing that sucks if there is alot of warbound item drops in mythic plus.. it de-incentivizes gear sharing at the end of a dungeon.
[6:41:20] Aidler: maybe just a thematically new name for account bound
[6:41:22] Brutefiend: i dont think they can stop completely, they need a catch up for returning players

[6:57:42] Shrenko: LOVE it
[6:57:43] mrniceguy817: Old flight was how I loaded my bowls so I miss the old ways it was my afk time
[6:57:43] gho5tfinger: so much faster
[6:57:43] DunzoCD: its so fast though
[6:57:44] JasperCalico: why would you wanna move 10x slower
[6:57:45] 770Cash: its fast but i kinda just wanna ride
[6:57:46] MyNameIsVortex: Rather have dragon riding than regular at this point tbh
[6:57:46] MizixTV: Can’t stand Dragonriding. Hated it from Day 1.
[6:57:48] Nokterian: KEKW
[6:57:48] acklesdh: LUL
[6:57:50] Sheckly84: wow

[6:57:52] Sheckly84: thanks ian
[6:57:53] Zoitack: its just better than normal
[6:57:53] necralia: huge
[6:57:54] jiuggernaut: olofFACE
[6:57:55] ijuki: Funny guy
[6:57:56] Macehaed: KEKW
[6:57:56] Skobble: Explain that joke
[6:57:56] Asyrr1: cool at first then got boring
[6:57:57] chocobobo16: he got jokes
[6:57:59] Theduskflyer: yeah dragon riding is meh. its not terrible but ill take my reg flying anyday
[6:58:01] Yurian33: Ion dad joke
[6:58:03] illuminity44: It should be optional
[6:58:05] SerinaPendragon: I dont hate it, I jsut want a choice so I'm glad we are getting it
[6:58:11] DunzoCD: they should make normal flying much faster though
[6:58:12] MisterBongwater: you mean like the dragonflight season mounts ion? lol
[6:58:13] neftario105: towLets towGo
[6:58:15] Nokterian: you can choose between dragon and static riding chat
[6:58:16] Rem753: @Skobble horse is called invincible, people mistakenly called it invisible then memed that
[6:58:18] Eviltuna13: farming herbs will be better with TBC flying
[6:58:19] Nokterian: dont be angy
[6:58:19] Jarless: @PrincessAww because u can afk why doing it and hover
[6:58:22] Asyrr1: when im on a mount I dont wanna think
[6:58:24] src1923: i still enjoy dragonriding
[6:58:27] mrniceguy817: Big ass frog flying around
[6:58:27] HeatherJC83: yea regular flying feels soooooo slow now... i hate it lol
[6:58:30] necralia: Clap
[6:58:30] BulletSteel: running out of vigor and having to wait on the ground is annoying
[6:58:32] ijuki: @Skobble "why is called invincible when you can't see it" - That is joke
[6:58:33] Clicklesly: Isn't regular flying half slower?
[6:58:37] bunta80: @Towelliee with dynamic riding, what do you think this will mean for druids given shapeshifting is core fantasy? New form or not all?
[6:58:38] MyNameIsVortex: @Asyrr1 You play WoW to think?
[6:58:39] thenipple420: If i can't dragon ride mims head ima refund the xpac
[6:58:43] BulletSteel: especially when you are trying to tag a mob and cant get to it
[6:58:44] Skobble: @Rem753 Got it. lol thanks
[6:58:45] CrowMomocle: evilfmBONGO
[6:58:50] necralia: nice
[6:58:51] gassygatinho: @wsilverhawkw yes but if let's say mountain thane ends up being the best overall and you as arms warrior cannot select it you would be pretty much forced into playing fury at that point - this is more for mythic raiding and stuff but I really hope you can choose each of those 3 trees based on situation
[6:58:51] Syprus1: so we can still fly normal?
[6:58:53] xmedpakx: @Jarless as i said add a hover to dragon riding and bam fixed
[6:58:55] kostchie: I like it. It serves the purpose of traveling from place to place. What I do not like is that dragon riding is not very good for farming ore and herbs with
[6:58:56] VarlBGem: Ghostlands?
[6:58:58] Henke1983: not a fan of dynamic fliying
[6:58:59] Clicklesly: What about Silvermoon ^^
[6:59:01] Asyrr1: @MyNameIsVortex well just its just one spot to another
[6:59:01] Thoreya: we gonna be zoomin everywhere
[6:59:02] KillerSPER: @towelliee I just hate the resource of dynamic flying. Get rid of that and I'd be happy.
[6:59:02] WundertueteGER: LETSGO
[6:59:03] SavageCheez: So, no more hovering
[6:59:04] veryhairyheyyall: POG
[6:59:04] VarlBGem: Eversong?
[6:59:05] trippsski: what did the joke mean
[6:59:05] WSilverHawkW: @syprus1 yes
[6:59:06] just_laxus: hey thats me
[6:59:09] Eviltuna13: but still not in Blood elf zone
[6:59:13] VarlBGem: tear the portal down!!
[6:59:17] mrniceguy817: I’d like a toggle to turn old flying or new flight on or off
[6:59:20] gho5tfinger: @SavageCheez you can do both
[6:59:23] Aidler: yeah… how can you dragonfly on this sailing ship, you can have as a mount, for instance?
[6:59:24] Nokterian: see? dont be angry chat you can fly normal if you want
[6:59:25] SavageCheez: there we go
[6:59:26] Jarless: thank god
[6:59:26] just_laxus: thank god normal flying stays in
[6:59:28] neftario105: Dragon baby
[6:59:37] mrniceguy817: Oh shot I asked and he delivered
[6:59:41] chaffeeman: is today the last day to push keys?
[6:59:44] DunzoCD: tbc flying should be 850%
[6:59:45] jarilrpg: they need to speed it up
[6:59:45] Wcvechten: probably not
[6:59:45] kaijoe_: Nah, you gotta suck it up
[6:59:45] madbombz_fth: probly not
[6:59:46] notColt45: probably not
[6:59:46] MyNameIsVortex: Nope
[6:59:47] Maruika: you gonna be slow
[6:59:47] Metket: no
[6:59:48] Shrenko: you gonna be slacking behind
[6:59:50] JasperCalico: yeah that ain't happening
[6:59:52] Featherbow: I doubt it
[6:59:52] mavericks312: probably not
[6:59:54] Ezekyler: i don't think sio
[6:59:55] grimmy17: Definitely not
[6:59:56] kostchie: no
[6:59:57] Armdel: im guessing thats the trade off, normal riding are slower
[6:59:57] Molvonos: nope
[6:59:57] Greencaps07: probably not
[6:59:57] ijuki: No, you will have 310% and be happy with it
[6:59:57] Ezekyler: so*
[6:59:58] necralia: prob not
[6:59:58] malaano: asking too much LUL
[6:59:58] snake_like: doubt it
[6:59:58] just_laxus: i hope so
[6:59:59] herzlustafir: checking off some predictions
[7:00:01] Eviltuna13: i hear the druid flight form will be dragon riding also
[7:00:02] Jarless: honestly i hope no
[7:00:04] ElymianStream: Nah, for active participation you should be able to fly faster
[7:00:04] Rem753: well then no one would dragon fly
[7:00:04] jarilrpg: it should be slower than dynamic, but faster than it is now
[7:00:04] Maruika: that would make no one dragon ride lol
[7:00:05] kaijoe_: Nope
[7:00:06] Anthy1887: nah
[7:00:06] JasperCalico: they're not even letting you use tbc flight at the start STILL
[7:00:07] elirank9: No cause no one would use dragon flying
[7:00:08] notdustinx: flying thru stormwind at 700%?
[7:00:09] kostchie: We are not getting both
[7:00:09] edeasknight: boomer flying goes boomer speed
[7:00:09] VarlBGem: I would hope they'd match speeds
[7:00:09] Greencaps07: at least 500%
[7:00:09] sirhazelton: no
[7:00:11] allisonkielle: I mean dragonriders have to work for that speed
[7:00:11] xrandomdoodx: Im OK with that tradeoff of the easier flying being slower
[7:00:12] Yurian33: tooo much
[7:00:13] Minifurnace: I think it might look cheeky if regular mounts went that fast
[7:00:14] Asyrr1: its like you feel like you have to do dragon riding or youre gonna be left behind
[7:00:15] snake_like: it's a tradeoff imo
[7:00:15] notdustinx: sounds like ez flyhacking
[7:00:16] mavericks312: you have to have a reason for ppl to use dynamic flying
[7:00:17] smashwow: probably but they haven't said
[7:00:19] motorboatingpro: speed will probably be the perk of manual flying
[7:00:19] MisterBongwater: I could see them bumping it up a little but not comparable to dragonflying
[7:00:21] eldritchcoffee: I'd rather 310% fly most of the time than use dragonriding
[7:00:24] just_laxus: i can't really do dragonriding cause of my visual impairment so i hope they buff normal flying a bit
[7:00:26] SaltywankeR: they said if u dont wanna dragonride n jus afk in the air then toggle.. guess thats the W for it
[7:00:29] grimmy17: Doubtful
[7:00:30] BoezIRL: they could make it a bit faster
[7:00:31] Mishkka: I just want to be able to afk fly in the new zones
[7:00:34] Dreathhammer: 500%
[7:00:42] necralia: Clap
[7:00:43] JasperCalico: Clap
[7:00:43] AlphasaurusRexx: dragonflying fastest default is 930%. just make regular flying that
[7:00:44] VarlBGem: regular flying doesn't have that boost either
[7:00:45] Alepouditsa: yea some times you just want to watch youtube and auto fly
[7:00:45] grimmy17: No point updating an old system that's technically being replaced
[7:00:46] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @shaxxtv (warning)
[7:00:46] MyNameIsVortex: Make dragonriding even faster instead EZ
[7:00:49] valianya: They might reduce max speed in old zones and use graphics to still visually feel fast
[7:00:54] Laptican: If they kept the regular flying to the 310% then i doubt anyone would go for it
[7:00:54] ijuki: That "yeah" was amazing lol
[7:01:07] shaxxtv: why did i get timed out?
[7:01:08] mrniceguy817: I’m ok with that
