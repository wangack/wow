[0:57:20] TaogWoW: @Fishmobile I haven't tried a controller, but it may be worse. Problem is more lack of feeling in right hand than it is dexterity. I've got full range of motion back now.
[0:57:33] Tzarrus: so it's like the Runes in LA?
[0:58:12] SadSleepyGirlGaming: oh this looks neat
[0:59:11] Khadgarlic: Season 8 will be good, we promise
[0:59:25] theANGRYcasual: So is the consensus that this next season might make it worth playign again?
[0:59:27] Fishmobile: @TaogWoW That's great to hear your range is back!  Hopefully things continue to get better.  I'm glad you are able to enjoy WoW.  I've played both WoW and D4 with K/M and a controller, so was curious if that would be something to consider.
[0:59:43] side_eff3cts: sorry, you said loot filter this season? or next
[0:59:54] malnourish_: s4 seems like itll be same core issue tho, better items... but what do i use them on? the power gains are easy, nothing rewarding to utilize it for
