[0:51:54] Klopernikus: WoW in Gamepass soon?
[0:51:58] XauceLord: honestly fuck microsoft
[0:51:59] Erixx: def a little nervous
[0:51:59] aziidus: maybe he was forced to go
[0:52:02] polesreport: Not nervous at all. Ybarra didn't do much and the CDO focused on mobile games
[0:52:03] Zarjanda: could it not be microsoft forcing this? either quit or get let go
[0:52:03] saamwiseganja: Xar, sometimes people are fired but are asked to quit to save dignity etc.
[0:52:07] Whitemamba236: I iamgine there is so much more red tape that the executives have to deal with now that Microsoft is in charge
[0:52:09] zupokupo: they probably felt accomplished and want to move onto their next chapter after selling to msft
[0:52:10] dotglad: i agree @XauceLord
[0:52:10] larnsmarf: wait a company got bought out and people got fired?? no way shocker. crazy
[0:52:11] Nazhjin: exec teams likely got multi million dollar packages

[0:52:26] adam_brisbane: leaving or getting sacked as Blizzard has had a lot of big failures the last year not in Wow, D4 is a mess and OW2 is terrible
[0:52:26] hutchyy917: @saamwiseganja yes. that's not what's happening here
[0:52:27] Diddly_dope: likely worse

[0:52:36] sound_wayv: coulda been for any reason, re-locatin, different job responsibilties, better offers, etc
[0:52:36] aziidus: yeah
[0:52:39] saamwiseganja: correct
[0:52:39] SillyPanda: 100%
[0:52:40] H_9_K: scummy af
[0:52:42] jtemp23: yeah maybe MS didnt want him back
[0:52:42] killthnrun: wht clas did he play
[0:52:43] hutchyy917: i dont think so
[0:52:44] Mestema17: that happens a lot at senior levels
[0:52:44] mello_yollo: most liekly
[0:52:47] Overdue_Cake: Happened to me
[0:52:47] chroakio: microsoft has done a good job in most aspect, I think they will deliver on blizzard, look at mincraft they have done a good job
[0:52:47] bodaciousblood13: that's the most likely scenario
[0:52:48] walozdle: "refired"
[0:52:49] Alassianss: no shut
[0:52:50] Greytness: They let the employees go this morning. 1 of my friends was 1
[0:52:50] bralter: forced retirement essentially
[0:52:51] FuriousNoodles: no theyre asked to quit so the company doesnt have to pay severance
[0:52:52] hutchyy917: wow, nevermind lol
[0:52:53] DuckTwelve: When wells fargo laid us off, we all got an email that told us to be on a call at 11, we called in and it was a recording of someone laying us off... @Xaryu

[0:52:57] disciple007: usually massive layoffs in every big merger @Xaryu
[0:52:57] Reaperz_kinetic: nah that’s not tinfoil that happens all the time
[0:52:57] TheLaxedd: i was just in another stream and the streamer said “somebody bad that guy” and I thought of you Kappa
[0:52:58] GetSomeSon: Keep blizzard blue? Political reasons? 1/2 truth speak, maybe he left cause he was red?
[0:52:58] seven__h: They made an offer he couldn't refuse
[0:52:59] wy0m1ng: very common practice
[0:53:00] stycks_on_: most likely, quite common for higher ups
[0:53:00] Chrigss: thats pretty typical for these situations
[0:53:02] joonelius3: who was this guy?
[0:53:04] BCboy_: That almost always happens
[0:53:07] xWizard_Dx: Why? Don't you not get severance if you quit?
[0:53:10] Reaperz_kinetic: @ducktwelve that’s fucked
[0:53:11] Zarjanda: It is either Mike said I did this already and they suck or microsoft was like you're out quit to save face if you want
[0:53:12] adam_brisbane: looks at D4 and OW2 they are both a mess under his watch he would of bene asked to leave for sure
[0:53:12] dotglad: i wouldn't leave a company go to work for someone else just to have the original company buy them out. have to give them the finger twice
[0:53:13] Grocery7: rainbows and butterflies
[0:53:13] RayLawn: that does happen a lot in companies
[0:53:15] GordyW: $$
[0:53:21] Bamboo808: with large M&As this isnt uncommon to reshuffle leadership
[0:53:22] Diddly_dope: ok but in all honesty microsoft is a very solid company that has been consistent for years hopefully they will translate that over to bliz
[0:53:22] swyftboi: It wasn't all strippers and burritos

[0:53:40] Morningscraps: Blizzards color are blue, no?
[0:53:41] BCboy_: maybe diablo losing 90% of players was part of it lol
[0:53:42] chroakio: @berserage95 I dont agree
[0:53:43] jacksunson: sunshine, lolipoops and rainbows
[0:53:48] asloff: oh god, please dont let there be more "cubicle crawls"

[0:54:05] geminuspr: Hmm
[0:54:07] killthnrun: yes
[0:54:08] ketchgg: @Xaryu I think its related to a personality activity where a "Blue" is someone who values the emotional wellbeing of their coworkers.

[1:07:30] Spikeqc: Susge TeaTime  󠀀
[1:07:30] zupokupo: it could also just be because they want change, and cant have change with someone who's content at 20 years
[1:07:31] RaavGaming: RaavGaming subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:07:32] demonzhunter: i mean what does it mean?
[1:07:33] Sendsz: It really comes down to what people are in positions
[1:07:35] Chrigss: he left microsoft to work on the merger
[1:07:38] CardozaYT: @Adaliahx You literally cannot do that. You need to pump (or breastfeed) regularly or you stop producing milk. And with regularly it means every couple of hours. I understand you are a wow player and therefore most likely virgin, but please take an anathomy class.
[1:07:39] chewzlurv: A lot of C suite folks stay through the transition but know that they're going to leave after
[1:07:43] TheMightis: Uncertain times for WoW for the next 2 years
[1:07:43] Tropicocity: chief design officer, cofounder, also leaving Aware

[1:07:47] Coorslite619: its time
[1:07:48] Snakix: retirerment
[1:07:52] myggen2000: He just got bored man
[1:07:54] N4A5T: conflict of interest? he didn’t like Microsoft and didn’t want to work under those people?
[1:07:54] naturalcompassion: naturalcompassion subscribed with Prime. 
[1:07:56] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: they cut him a check

[1:07:59] ilummina: becouse money
[1:08:00] packtar: retaliation
[1:08:01] ScuzzyScoundrel: because he got a phat check and they wanted fresh meat

[1:08:07] spiritsland: @Xaryu probably personal reason, MFST now most valuable company in the world I wouldnt worry

[1:08:09] demonzhunter: fair play
[1:08:09] Tropicocity: Hmm
[1:08:10] snugglefistsgaming: might have been reporting to a boss he hated.
[1:08:10] Knaxxis: joining Ghostcrawler team @Xaryu
[1:08:11] Veniman: he wants to spend time with family
[1:08:12] RaavGaming: They probably bought out his equity and gave him no reason to stay
[1:08:12] Tangents92: They could of offered him something so thats why he stepped down instead of getting fired @Xaryu
[1:08:13] XauceLord: it was probably when microsoft patented patent WO2020060606
[1:08:14] inspect4: let the man enjoy his milk smh
[1:08:16] VerdenTheBleak: he could have issues with microsoft higher ups

[1:08:25] Jinjzo: TELL ME IM BLIND
[1:08:26] Sendsz: his promotion could have been cut off, structural changes, are MASSIVLEy impactful. As someone who has gone through a merger like this, it is more than likely he weighed his options "do i continue" or do i just go ahead and take some time off and go to a new company for a change".

[1:09:26] Klopernikus: sod best thing since legion
[1:09:26] MrCharles_12: I feel like you hit it on the head earlier, he left to do something new.. The past came into the new and he probably just wants to keep growing and challenging himself.. Most people aren't like that and accept complacency.
[1:09:28] demonzhunter: more than other expansions anyway

[1:11:23] mellven: laying off the big covid bloat hires that all of tech saw, makes sense
[1:11:24] BCboy_: have to wait for next expansion for any blizz game to tell
[1:11:25] grylz89: 1900 jobs cut is a massive deal, clearly the new owners seen alot of bloated salaries
[1:11:26] efracozz: they always do when takeovers and mergers
[1:11:28] thebigdongerhere: Listen u can see every company does it
[1:11:29] brent2041: @Xaryu  history says L. Bethesda and Rare are L examples
[1:11:35] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: competition is good for the consumer, so we'll lose that soon
[1:11:38] Coorslite619: I think we just need to be cautiously optimistic
[1:11:42] brokkrbadger: maybe they fired bad balance / feature ppl X__x
[1:11:43] CardozaYT: What competition? 10 companies own the whole world.
[1:11:43] pyrosupreme1: yeah
[1:11:44] Jubilation12: competition creates good products
[1:11:48] Tropicocity: Microactiblizz
[1:11:51] chroakio: its difficult to see why they leave, when blizzards was just blizzard they were their own bosses and had more freedom, now when blizzard is under microsoft, its like getting demoted and angry step dad standing over you. I would leave aswell.
[1:11:51] demonzhunter: yeah
[1:11:52] berserage95: a company that cant make good games bought another company that cant make good games, what is there to discuss LUL
[1:11:53] H_9_K: Mass firing can only be seen as a massive L, no matter the reasons imo
[1:11:53] HunterericTV: big W maybe now they will make stuff we want and not what we want with their own ideas (SOD)
[1:11:55] XauceLord: I would say its fixing whats not broken but blizzard broke their own product doing the same shit
[1:11:56] cobraCordite: Seeing lots of twitter messages popping up from Blizzard employees that have just been laid off, it's filtering through now.
[1:11:58] thebigdongerhere: I put my faith in the light and metzen ofc ppc
[1:11:58] Doimos89: They should include WOW sub in gamepass then we would have all the tgames
[1:12:02] demonzhunter: maybe
[1:12:06] Judeese: Maybe Holly Longdale will be president at this point flopdrPog
[1:12:12] somadaz: the previous 10 ish
[1:12:15] roztoky: Let people can be cause of a new direction or ego battleing other reasons already mentioned
[1:12:18] its_starsky: less competition means they will jump the monthly payments !
[1:12:19] thebigdongerhere: Meh medium efford
[1:12:20] demonzhunter: yeah its been good
[1:12:21] VerdenTheBleak: Didn't they cancel the PvE in OW2 last year?
[1:12:21] packtar: Where do you think Allen Adam will go, maybe team up with other x-blizzard folks working on new games.
[1:12:23] demonzhunter: recently
[1:12:24] chroakio: It's easy to understand why they're departing. When Blizzard was an independent entity, they enjoyed greater autonomy and freedom. However, now that Blizzard is a part of Microsoft, the dynamics have changed significantly. It's akin to experiencing a demotion, with a strict overseer monitoring every move. Personally, I would also consider leaving in such circumstances
[1:12:25] The_Naise: microsoft has never acquired a developer and not made them worse
[1:12:25] Snakix: What does Barny think about all that ? xarKEK
[1:12:25] adam_brisbane: no Wow has done better not blizzard
[1:12:27] Grocery7: meh they're just rebranded version of the same old product though
[1:12:28] Tokman: Yea but xbox console is a dead brand in Europe and Japan. They need so step up.
[1:12:29] Famewar: this news made me micro soft
