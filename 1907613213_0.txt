[8:20:34] Vx_Odessa_xV: @swifty - Why by your stream’s title name..is your swifty only harcore..and not hardcore, Swifty? Does he have performance issues? Perhaps issues in personal value or worth? …I’m curious.

[8:23:32] adhd_rbg: Happy to see no yiming dragons here….
[8:23:44] Vx_Odessa_xV: @swifty - Just a cheap, backwards way of saying your swifty didnt have a D..both playing at well, the obvious D we know HE would and should have..and the “D” you dont want him to have, as it would mean even another “D” he would be given..those being Death, and Deletion.
