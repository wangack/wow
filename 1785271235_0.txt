[3:02:57] Zucchey: I'm sure countries that didn't get adds are happy to get a form of add now :D they must by thrilled
[3:02:59] itsDets: I think it's way better this way than "seeing" those ads
[3:02:59] nouwandhi: Just install a add blocker and never see ads no moew
[3:03:05] SymphonyOnIce: plot twist
[3:03:05] veryhairyheyyall: FeelsBadMan
[3:03:07] DudeTheory: Takes away one of the main benefits of being a sub
[3:03:09] Shakalakin: I also think it's less on the viewers to be pursaded to buy a sub to said channel

[3:10:28] Molvonos: 'I like watching streamers do their thing but I dont want to make sure they get paid so they can't keep streaming.  Where streamer go?!'

[3:10:55] SimplyRed: Well its interesting right, with a tv commercial you know while watchin it that the show is "Paused" on here, you're going to miss things. I've seen people like Maxamillion, take a moment for himself during ads so nothing is missed.
[3:10:57] BlindsydeGaming: Do they feel that ad revenue out weighs viewer retention? Won’t people just come in for free loot and to click the ad and then never watch the streamer?

[4:21:16] abracka_: wish it launched earlier in the day on 6/1 but 4pm is still okay
[4:21:55] gazaway: I think they expected people to realize they can teleport to the top and wind around from there
[4:22:44] ninedraft317: it looks like it doesnt go to the bottom
[4:22:57] gazaway: But faster than randomly teleporting I'd imagine
[4:24:06] xmedpakx: i am surprised the fire ones are not stronger tbh
[4:24:21] xImmortalGodx: can you pass along to blizz that AA still bugs lol
