[2:27:56] FaxiEUW: Daytrading is not illegal lol..
[2:28:07] Goonzie99: the game is rigged man
[2:28:12] GenericFutureMan: you just have to use a different platform
[2:28:18] FaxiEUW: thats a stupid app!!
[2:28:19] goosejamss: you need an account with $25k in it
[2:28:26] NinjaChane: That's why people don't like robinhood
[2:28:27] Maraiko14: use an other app
[2:28:27] goosejamss: then you can daytrade
[2:28:32] Gotizie: there are different sets of rules in some platforms for day trading vs non day trading
[2:28:40] goosejamss: its not about the app guys
[2:28:40] bavomeisteR: dont use robinhood
[2:28:49] NinjaChane: use fidelity or something else
[2:28:55] NinjaChane: I use fidelity.
[2:28:59] goosejamss: it has to be more than $25k in an account for any broker @Swifty
[2:29:05] Mesmaroth: Have you tried Public?
[2:29:27] bavomeisteR: daytrading is a pita for taxes tho
[2:29:31] FaxiEUW: You dont need 25k. You can leverage your investment. e.g. 30x your investment. But be warned, you may be getting big earnings fast, but you can loose everything just as fast.

[2:30:09] FaxiEUW: So if you leverage 1k dollars. Its like you invested 30k.
[2:30:13] NinjaChane: robinhood is so popular because they have one of the cleanest and user friendly UI for people new to stocks/investing
[2:30:29] Hyelander_: Also, earning taxes for that is on another bracket
[2:30:31] artalis89: Just put in what you are willing to lose.
[2:30:41] bavomeisteR: pita = pain in the ...
[2:30:49] goosejamss: you're literally borrowing the money to bet it when you "leverage"
[2:30:52] SiderealAngel: Teach me your ways @faxieuw

[5:07:01] Ramenmaster7000: Huh? I got hit by ads. Carbs?
[5:07:50] Larry_J_Gooseman: Under 50g a day is usually an obtainable goal
[5:07:56] Ramenmaster7000: I eat like none now. I eat air fried chicken, fish, squash, broccoli. I'm not a expert on keto I just know I think its 20 carbs
[5:08:02] diedsoloblameme: for men its 50g of carbs tops on keto. For women its 25
[5:08:05] Ramenmaster7000: It may be 50
[5:08:11] terrible_cereal: wont lie kinda sad your not a human wearing the banana set anymore :(

[5:09:08] nixn456: jesus
[5:09:10] Ramenmaster7000: Yeah it's crazy how it works. I tried keto before and barely ate keto friendly food so I quit. This time I'm eating more and staying full. 3 meals a day, 2 chicken thighs and some greens.
[5:09:14] JWelly: !points

[5:10:29] pogslammer89: Keto can be dangerous biologically spea\king for some, but what isnt.
[5:10:40] Ramenmaster7000: Yeah I'm ok if I'm full just last times I barely ate. I'm happy now and I'm losing weight. 60 pounds to go.
[5:10:41] thedonmac: FortOne <3 FortOne <3 FortOne
[5:11:00] Larry_J_Gooseman: tbh carb cycling on keto works amazing
[5:11:26] Lightasaurus: Murse here, as long as you don't have a preexisting condition that predisposes you to kidney injury, kidney disease etc, it's just fine

[5:12:25] Ramenmaster7000: I think it'll work for me. I stopped gaining weight off-keto by eating small portions.
[5:12:41] lordcosmiccloud: i lost like 20 kg on keto
[5:13:01] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[5:13:29] Cowardpatty: I lost 50lb's from Oct. 21 to April 22 just by being in a calorie deficit the entire time.  It kind of sucked, but needed to be done.
[5:13:30] Lightasaurus: The ultimate goal is less calories in than out. Keto is a hunger friendly way to accomplish that. I see good things with IF
[5:13:56] Fopfop: so how does this build works?
[5:14:04] Zethious: Is keto not bad for your hearth? So much fat with cheese and meats
[5:14:12] Zethious: Heart*
[5:14:15] Ramenmaster7000: I will heed your warning. I just hope I don't get sick and have to go to the hospital.
[5:16:08] 5antino: I do intermittent fasting and just eat when hungry
[5:16:17] Ramenmaster7000: Hmmm....research
[5:16:24] TeraCeltica: working out and eat correctly is the way =)
[5:16:40] gutzwow: best way is to slowly introduce more and more carbs after doing keto so your body adjusts slowly
[5:16:54] pogslammer89: Keto, carnivore deits etc, imo theyre all get rich quick schemes, just burn more calories than you intake its really that simple.

[5:19:46] 5antino: yeah my brother did it and he lost like 70+ lbs and has less body fat
[5:19:59] gutzwow: you lose weight on keto because you are always in a calorie deficit
[5:19:59] Talason: swifty are you prepared for wrath?
[5:20:03] Ramenmaster7000: Hard DnB
[5:20:07] gutzwow: its very hard to over eat on keto

[5:20:37] Ramenmaster7000: OH REALLY?!
[5:20:49] MADcefa: I tried keto and I f*** up haha
[5:21:05] gutzwow: yeah once your body starts using your fat as fuel u get energy back, thats from calorie deficit not keto
[5:21:18] Ramenmaster7000: I can't workout on keto but maybe I get energy in ketosis.
