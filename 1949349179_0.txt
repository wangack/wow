[0:53:13] Cathercy: @mark_th3_gr3at there was a blue post: Icecrown Citadel has an attempts counter. When your Heroic attempts counter hits zero, both the Heroic and Normal difficulty end-wing bosses will no longer spawn for the rest of the current week. Thus, in order to fight Putricide, Sindragosa, Blood-Queen, or the Lich King on Normal difficulty, you must have at least one remaining attempt.

[2:37:31] Imparu: 3rd hardest?
[2:37:31] zynomicon: @D347Hzor this? nah. Putricide is probably the only hard boss outside of LK
[2:37:32] PrangePlays: yeah its nice to see a game that requires everyone to have good skill
[2:37:33] Imparu: isnt prof harder
[2:37:36] awake_84: wait till you get to sindragosa lol
[2:37:36] demiilova93: @shroud sup man
[2:37:42] aleckarlo: Harder than prof i think
[2:37:44] D347Hzor: people usually skip it on heroic cause u dont need it to go lk
[2:37:45] jjersku: Does Ska still play WoW?
[2:37:49] RiuKuli: Chill of throne -20% dodge and without buffs 5-30% for heal, hp, damage. It is really hard
[2:37:54] Imparu: lk>prof>lady
[2:37:59] FlylessJake: hi
[2:38:10] ree0ree0: lady dm heroic is one of hardest. prof is harder.
[2:38:11] FearMe2020: i remember pulling this boss by mistake with my warlock lol
[2:38:15] Mdc_Sharingan: LUL
[2:38:25] yunojelly: Increase your Contrast to 100% for this fight only, it makes the ghost so easily spotted
[2:38:28] Tolkien_Bullet: Good Night From Portugal <3
[2:38:29] XenoBaz: id say hardest bosses in here are lady deathwhisper, putricide (until the tank knows how to mop up and drive the abom) and lich king is well a 20 min fight xD regardless of difficulty
[2:38:29] RiuKuli: @Imparu This
[2:38:37] Juggax: Mad cleave
[2:38:37] D347Hzor: theres an addon that makes ghosts look like bears

[2:38:44] Mapthesoul: Honestly watching this makes me glad I didnt start it looks like a clusterfuck of a lot of stuff
[2:38:45] zynomicon: @ree0ree0 yeah. but again, those are just things you go through and have everyone learn. there's not much in them
[2:38:50] slothestsloth: Pp >LDW>BPC is 3 hardest imo in heroic
[2:38:52] Tolkien_Bullet: watching this i miss PWI
[2:39:05] CodyTheParadox: @FearMe2020 yooo what same!!! Lifes a simulation LOL
[2:39:26] PrangePlays: this is nostalgic as hell lmao
[2:39:37] Tolkien_Bullet: @PrangePlays legit
[2:39:50] Haynex_: what is going on even in this game. i only see numbers and bars....
[2:39:52] bilochita: yeah i was harsh in my last msg,.
[2:39:58] RiuKuli: Actually maybe in difficulties: lk>prof>lady/sindragosa
[2:40:05] ree0ree0: @zynomicon ofc if everyone is on-point ..
[2:40:16] Mimerss: @Haynex_ Read the timers to the right
[2:40:20] aperioNFPS: noooo WoW????
[2:40:31] Supersamss: first LK tries any second from progress
[2:40:33] MrWilsonFPS: is this retail or classic
[2:40:42] XenoBaz: @Riukuli you are spot on although sindragosa is pretty dam easy when every hides properly, xD
[2:41:03] Fossabot: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[2:41:07] 3xohit: Wow retail is so ass
[2:41:11] zynomicon: @ree0ree0 idk. I think we got world first on pretty much all of those, except the easiest ones where US guilds got them due to being 1 day early. only LK was tight, rest was handful of people just fucking up
[2:41:21] AngerBert: my biggest icc ptsd is from lk defile on hard mode. messing that up was the worst lol
[2:41:34] eut_im: Can u move raid frame ?
[2:41:45] flipppig: wipe it up boys
[2:41:47] PrangePlays: that is tough
[2:41:48] Tolkien_Bullet: i still prefer Perfect World International to WoW tho <3
[2:41:50] XenoBaz: @AngerBert being the one screaming on discrord when the angels taking you off the ledge :<
[2:41:54] ree0ree0: @zynomicon you referring to classic or original ?
[2:41:56] thr6x: when new world
[2:42:02] zynomicon: original
[2:42:05] th3_ficho: Is this hc or
[2:42:07] bilochita: you like shooter games. yes?
[2:42:09] Tolkien_Bullet: but this is VERY nostalgic
[2:42:11] AngerBert: @XenoBaz NotLikeThis
[2:42:15] neugassh: @thr6x nw is dead
[2:42:16] ree0ree0: @zynomicon na or eu ?
[2:42:25] snuggielol: @th3_ficho how could it be hc? when hc is only classic
[2:42:34] th3_ficho: Heroic
[2:42:34] Tolkien_Bullet: @neugassh alrdy?
[2:42:35] zynomicon: EU. I meant my guild specifically
[2:42:39] XenoBaz: Most guilds needed the buffs to kill LK, lk was by far one of the hardest bosses they ever made
[2:42:45] XenoBaz: 20-25 minute fight.
[2:42:46] th3_ficho: Not hardcore
[2:42:47] vu___: wiping on 20yr old content LOLW
[2:43:01] ree0ree0: @zynomicon then i guess you heared of kebab then ?
[2:43:05] Supersamss: progress is on LK

[2:43:28] Tehsunman: @vu___ and making money from it, what are you doing? KEKW
[2:43:29] zynomicon: @ree0ree0 doesn't ring a bell. what do you mean?
[2:43:30] datmoose23: uhg =(
[2:43:32] XenoBaz: i would love to see these people killing it without ICC gear on launch.
[2:43:39] RiuKuli: @zynomicon Those 30s debuffs and coordination when 6 icejails came (hide) and destroying them at the right time was hard to coordinate
[2:43:41] XenoBaz: having tier from normal would help...
[2:43:44] HaZaRaKK: <3
[2:43:50] Luxper1: if ONLY I COULD WATCH THE STREAM FROM THESE 10 MIN ADS
[2:43:52] ronzu: @datmoose23 get adblocker
[2:43:58] johnnnnieg: You no longer need to clear it once before heroic? :O
[2:44:08] eut_im: Can u move raid frame ?
[2:44:09] ree0ree0: @zynomicon kebab had world first on icc 25 and hc on eu. i know this because i was in kebab
[2:44:31] zynomicon: @ree0ree0 I don't remember. I played in Paragon
[2:44:44] irishxfl: Shroud do you play PUBG anymore?
[2:44:46] NicNameXD: Oh no, i have an Assassins Creed ad
[2:44:46] XenoBaz: on launch id go for saurfang, boat, valithra on hc probably sindragosa too.
[2:44:53] Tolkien_Bullet: PWI FTW
[2:44:56] Tolkien_Bullet: <3
[2:45:08] ree0ree0: @zynomicon oh right ok...
[2:45:10] RiuKuli: @XenoBaz Those 30s debuffs and coordination when 6 icejails came (hide) and destroying them at the right time was hard to coordinate at sindragosa
[2:45:25] cs2beans: i have no idea whats happening

[2:45:35] Tehsunman: @cs2beans they're dying
[2:45:37] Alaziara: again
[2:45:59] cs2beans: thats all i understand
[2:46:04] XenoBaz: @Riukuli tbh i genuinely dont remember much issues with that boss, it wasnt as hard as say the bite mechanic and putricide, like LK was legit impossible even on normal,
[2:46:09] JackJackerJacky: PUBG unless you tryhard you wont have a good time FallCry
[2:46:15] cs2beans: this game brings only death
[2:46:30] Tehsunman: @cs2beans their gear sucks and they skipped to heroic, its expected
[2:46:37] Yedips69: whats this guild's name?
[2:46:54] Derpiino: the Voice actor for lady is great man
[2:46:56] Derpiino: give me chills

[2:47:18] Yedips69: name of the guild!!!!
[2:47:20] Ravenfeldt: @Tehsunman did they seriously did that? lmao. Endless wipes incoming
[2:47:36] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[2:47:37] Tehsunman: i mean its possible @Ravenfeldt but you gotta put a lot of hours into it
[2:48:10] Keshmar: is this test server or official icc launch ?
[2:48:10] kachupoyski: Is RMT allowed here?
[2:48:12] cs2beans: what is shrouds job here
[2:48:17] Tehsunman: official @Keshmar
[2:48:25] Tehsunman: @cs2beans dps
[2:48:26] Keshmar: @Tehsunman ty
[2:48:26] dotaritodorito: 0 dispells
[2:48:38] ree0ree0: my favourite is Blood-Queen Lana'thel  make sure you have the dps :)
[2:48:41] RiuKuli: @XenoBaz Vampire princess(bite) we did it like 3rd try. Sindragosa gave nasty debuff that you couldn't hit her or it stacked the debuff and did aoe dmg. Cant remember how many stack you could take with your own cd's but had to run away etc.
[2:48:51] zynomicon: I think there's a decent chance of a HLK clear on first week. if you stack the raid hard enough to skip most Valkyrs it's borderline doable; you don't have to waste pulls on making addons work and figuring out the fight
[2:49:22] goonttv_yt: chat is he over new world already?
[2:49:32] MrTTapson: What‚Äôs Azeroth campaign?

[2:50:39] MrTTapson: What‚Äôs the difference between wow classic and wow?
[2:50:45] trillwrldd_: can u move the raid ui up a little
[2:50:50] Matthes10499: @iacewheeler different expansions
[2:50:51] XenoBaz: the only thing that went wrong with that pull was people didnt freak out and panic and just cleaned up the adds.
[2:50:55] Tehsunman: @iacewheeler one is old and one isn't
[2:50:59] isatchy: Not using track undead? 1% more dmg vs undead

[2:52:02] zl_Realistic_lz: What UI are you using @shroud
[2:52:02] XenoBaz: LOL
[2:52:04] CAD604: tongue the boss
[2:52:07] dotaritodorito: its funny how in wotlk private servers ppl standard for dps in icc25hc  is 17-19k bcs thats all they do xD
[2:52:18] wyldbylli: What servers are raiding still?
[2:52:20] kachupoyski: is their guild wars?
[2:52:24] ronzu: @zl_Realistic_lz uber UI maybe?
[2:52:34] XenoBaz: also get dks to blow their anti magic shells so they can be cced cleanly
[2:52:37] Halfyy_: Mythic Razageth was so dogshit
[2:52:40] MrTTapson: Is shroud playing classic?
[2:52:41] Bleedorang3: Nah I loved the Rasz fight
[2:52:41] jordzkie05: nostalgia factor helps
[2:52:49] xiongz: anyone here who quit smoking weed getting chest pains & anxiety attacks

[3:59:12] DystceBtwen: Google says: It is often found near citrus plants. While scorpions are basically associated with desert climates, the bark scorpion prefers dark, moist environments. Citrus trees provide the perfect place for them to settle in. If you have citrus plants in your yard, you are unknowingly hosting a scorpion infestation

[4:04:48] MoonLiit: (Never played ICC) So basically what you need to do @shroud is A, B, and C. And don't forget D
[4:04:51] XenoBaz: enhancement shammy is fun in icc
[4:05:01] Hellmenarms: I just came for wow content, but not for the adds
[4:05:03] Bomb_Logic: Shroud have you tried simply KILLING the boss? PepeLaugh
[4:05:11] LeAndylon: Prolly sucks because you adapt to people always talking out their ass and you end up missing the good stuff cuz you auto filter.
[4:05:11] kodder12: @freshlife  hell yes
[4:05:12] 9GM_: is WoW similar to PoE?
[4:05:14] taiwanesedave: just beat the boss and don't die, easy
[4:05:28] MoonLiit: @9GM_ nope
[4:05:33] HalfLeif: @smcoffey Yet combat in wow is so far ahead of those two that it keeps pulling ahead with 15-20 year old content on repeat, nothing feels as snappy/responsive as wow combat in the mmo genre
[4:05:34] irishjewbacca: too much comms
[4:05:35] bilochita: have a good night due
[4:05:35] huhahc_beastly: @9GM_ not rly
[4:05:37] striderik: @9GM_ very similar my dude, you have Hp and mana bar
[4:05:54] maxiReamer: !dbm pull 30
[4:05:57] 9GM_: was PoE similar  Diablo then?
[4:06:05] 9GM_: @striderik LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL PogChamp
[4:06:13] smcoffey: @HalfLeif that is not even relevant when people are bored of the content though
[4:06:21] hakkorato: @shroud will you go for sm quest ?
[4:06:24] MoonLiit: @HalfLeif BDO combat is ten times better, but yeah as far as tab targeting goes WoW is fire
[4:06:51] irishjewbacca: @hakkorato sm ? streamer loot xd
[4:06:53] Zagreus_IV: Is this nm or hc ?
[4:07:00] satafou: hc
[4:07:04] HalfLeif: @smcoffey It's highly relevant, because if people were so bored of the content why would they flock to that same game still? Must be something else then right?
[4:07:10] taiwanesedave: combat is great but can't deny that FFXIV has bucket loads of shit that doesn't involve just grinding for gear at end game
[4:07:12] smcoffey: wow is still a damn good value and good game it's not a question but its old and people are moving on

[4:16:29] hakkorato: dude bis rog is pog
[4:16:40] hakkorato: best dps is rog in this game
[4:16:46] Zagreus_IV: I've been doing icc for awhile now on private servers imo the difficulty order is LK>Sindra>pp>lady but as shroud said it depends
[4:16:53] HalfLeif: @smcoffey Doesn't prove people have abandoned wow and gone to gw2 and ff, which was your initial claims together with "wow" dead
[4:16:54] hakkorato: after rog bis balance dudu

[4:18:29] smcoffey: @HalfLeif i never once said it was dead maybe you should read.  it's getting smaller due to design choices and also people exploring other mmos after such a long time

[4:37:44] z1mpL_: They take reduced AOE dmg so you will only be at risk of pulling aggro if you have 2 points in Sanctified Wrath, and are under the effects of avenging wrath. Youd be hitting them for only a 50% reduction instead of like 98%
[4:37:45] blukush3: if you DI before he cast it will cancel the mark
[4:38:03] worry0r: It worked in original wrath but not anymore

[5:51:55] blindalbinio: Lost ark

[5:52:04] foooooozzzz: eso is still better than new world
[5:52:08] ryukexo: @Jlonn Nope
[5:52:17] Fair_Fites: only thing good about it is the constant effect
[5:52:17] triplezro: true and dont worry this week is a good week to skip mutations, they are horrid
[5:52:21] YotaByte1: the libram is strong
[5:52:21] Jlonn: @ryukexo then go for lost ark/new world
[5:52:23] Fair_Fites: exactly
[5:52:26] YotaByte1: and works for aoe

[5:52:43] Treir44: 2 piece
[5:52:44] Treir44: for sure
[5:52:46] marsh_8: has he been in here for 4.5 hours?
[5:52:51] irdakss: how about black desert?
[5:52:54] Death_Dono: libram early is good because later boss will die faster
[5:52:56] Fair_Fites: yeah
[5:53:03] wockyneek: New world is gonna die just like every other mmo that isn‚Äôt wow or RuneScape lol
[5:53:04] thetranchan: 4 set is kinda insane

[5:53:22] notsk24: @wockyneek dang I like new world lol
[5:53:27] GarbageM4n: There is no better time to get into retail WoW, it‚Äôs so fast to get to endgame and Metzen is back so story will actually make sense again

[5:55:18] crownymax: @lwisecarver  warlocks and dks are really good for progress but they will fall off hard to feral and mages when they are geared
