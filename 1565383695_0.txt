[1:33:33] llNoTToXiCll: alt f4 out Kap
[1:33:36] mavericks312: did they rework renown to level it up rather then 1 quest=1 renown
[1:33:43] zgag: BFA corruption gear was some of the best ever implemented
[1:34:00] TheCliffyShow: @RunningOutOfRAM They didn't remove it. Just forgot it existed.
[1:34:06] primej_24: How does Brew feel in DF
[1:34:06] mavericks312: so like 130k to max it all out
[1:34:08] llNoTToXiCll: @RunningOutOfRAM  if you are running out you should download more

[1:35:58] Zoitack: @PokerFaceMoose nah would be great but wouldve been in the leak that predicted everything else
[1:36:01] mavericks312: yea cause usually when you hit revered your already geared and the gear they offer isnt tht great
[1:36:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh shit
[1:36:28] mavericks312: if the rep itself offers gear that might be why its not account wide

[1:43:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: The soar speed thing doesn't sound like a real issue to me, as long as it feels fast
[1:43:57] Intern_Froddy: how much did they lower the speed though?

[1:54:59] Mecabeast: @glubbietv doubtful they really want you to interact with dragonriding so a whistle would be against it
[1:55:01] Frobnox: EverQuest had the best world events. You left with nothing or some really cool stuff.
[1:55:05] KaisenSiru: Events Pog
[1:55:31] atamala: @Mecabeast bummer with how big these zones are it wouldve been nice haha

[1:57:41] atamala: would be cool to grind rep for any faction regardless of expac via tabard
[1:57:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was convenient to get rep just by putting on a tabard in a dungeon
[1:57:53] Ekvision: or a daily cap
[2:00:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Elemental invasions sound like they could be good
[2:01:01] LCS01: @Towelliee thats something i miss in WoW, farm gear without being in dg and raid

[2:02:43] thebakeriscomingforu: ideally a healthy mix of renown gear, crafted gear, and dungeon gear would be nice.
[2:02:48] LCS01: @Ekvision ok but dg isnt the only way to grind, u can spend all they killing elites, but in wow not gonna work
[2:02:50] tornbraclet: @Ekvision for those of us that played everquest we dont mind grinding cause thats what we did
[2:02:51] Ekvision: also depends on the time it takes to farm that rep if it takes 4 weeks to get the good gear or 5 dungeon runs the choise is easy.

[2:04:30] Mecabeast: sl rep gear was decent it was at cn normal ilvl but was only like 2 pieces per re
[2:04:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having multiple sources of gear, from different kinds of content, yeah that's great

[2:35:43] mewkittymon: Can the spiders in that dungeon can that be tamed ? On a hunter.
[2:35:58] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I'm sure the reason mining/herbalism isn't out yet is because they plan on having them be secondary professions like cooking Kappa
[2:35:58] Analfabestia: yeah, I also thought it was 4 monks in the party :D
[2:36:02] gyllygan: !alpha

[2:39:21] Shrenko: @Skorbol1 ohh thank you
[2:39:40] bartholimu: get them sick gains brah
[2:39:44] Analfabestia: I don't like that to get roll, you need to spec into soothing mist
[2:39:50] Analfabestia: it should be baseline no?
[2:39:57] smol_gunner: i can see people getting insta kicked out of m+ if they dont take interrupt
[2:40:12] Ekvision: that one guy still dead and healer is like thats how you learn mtf
[2:40:14] Vitalsigns64: I think the roll in the tree is an extra charge
[2:40:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's already happening where the DPS doesn't have any interrupts because they chose damage instead....damn
[2:40:29] bypized: So how is the faction system? any good? @Towelliee
[2:40:46] KaisenSiru: Charizard?!
[2:40:48] RiskyBusines_ez: it has its own dmg
[2:40:48] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!

[2:45:32] theDirtyon3: i doubt more people are invited until Beta
[2:45:32] Tambandia: leech build is in
[2:45:33] jackace79: monk specs are looking pretty good. Hopefully some good tuning and all 3 specs could be good.
[2:45:38] AtriseOW: that helmet hahaha omg
[2:45:38] Shrenko: is this the new dungeon added @Towelliee
[2:45:44] zgag: Wave of invites for Alpha isn't really much of a wave.  You're probably looking at less than 100 invites
[2:45:47] Analfabestia: yeah, Blizzard saw that healers don't heal you so your new meta will be to gear with versatility and leech Kappa
[2:46:06] Mecabeast: I just copied tiger pandas mog for my monk

[2:46:11] zgag: Most of those go to content creators/ media,  WF types
[2:46:14] Dankind64: LOL what is that chart!
[2:46:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: evoker guy wtf
[2:46:18] jure__: one button gang

[2:46:38] ForgottenTime: Found the bot on alpha
[2:46:38] Dankind64: he's testing viability of one button playstyle
[2:46:41] Orion280: boosted
[2:46:56] JansonLives: He's just learning the spec one button at a time.
[2:46:59] CYNIC308: Towelliee you bring up something super interesting ... now that interrupts are optional for many tanks will that responsibility fall to dps now or do you think tanks will still be required?
[2:47:02] Eggz1004: mobs dying too fast, not enough time for rotation maybe?
[2:47:07] CYNIC308: brought up*
[2:47:18] elizondria: pyre isn't there for preservation and they did nerf evoker healing this build
[2:47:34] ruhroraggy: how does specing liek live play? going call to arms and last keg?
[2:47:43] zgag: If you're a normal player don't expect an Alpha invite.  It can happen, but it's pretty slim.  Best bet is beta invites
[2:47:57] AtriseOW: yeah i forgot to specc bonedust brew lol godsake. Ofc dps was low
[2:47:58] BillBob605: No Karma anymore BOIZ??

[2:49:42] zgag: @gamingaffliction_  Yea, beta will have the actual testing where Alpha is just mainly more about the marketing .   There will be far more invites going out for Beta
[2:49:54] Hodbroddpl: @Towelliee hey Mate
[2:49:55] Haikonlol: Hi @towelliee can u test prot warrior or dractyr healer please? Or have u already done it today on your stream?
[2:50:15] Hodbroddpl: @Towelliee Dragomir here :)
[2:50:19] RiskyBusines_ez: u have both ox talents?
[2:50:23] Haikonlol: Alright thanks mate!
[2:51:09] Warphunter: did instant vivify feel way better or didnt really change self healing
[2:51:09] RiskyBusines_ez: the bonus dmg is alot bigger in retail i think
[2:51:12] RiskyBusines_ez: cuz the conduit scales
[2:51:20] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[2:51:27] Haikonlol: U can swap talents like at the start of the dungeons right? Is this locked out on m+, or is that kind of info still unknown at this point of alpha?
[2:51:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think expel harm is better than instant vivify, probably
[2:51:56] Hodbroddpl: Cheers Mate nice tanking :)
[2:52:12] Mecabeast: wonder if instant vivify is good on mw
[2:52:25] Ekvision: I think since cd is faster it's lower dmg
[2:53:12] RiskyBusines_ez: if you spam crane kick, it might be good
[2:53:15] RiskyBusines_ez: otherwise i dont see it
[2:53:16] zgag: Oh and almost  forgot. New POE league soon
[2:53:21] Kentach: dont think instant vivify is gonna stay seems a tad bit too strong
[2:53:57] Mecabeast: does it make a sound ww does for procs
[2:54:20] ruhroraggy: have you played with call to arms yet?
[2:54:23] Ekvision: the talent tree is so much better that the crap we had last expansions
[2:54:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bear healing is way higher
[2:54:56] ruhroraggy: rip
[2:55:00] Squirrel_nutty: is there no char boost for bc classic
[2:55:02] rbailey_2222: good morning everyone

[2:57:22] DeanoTV: P OMEGALUL E
[2:57:33] cruzeal: poe ResidentSleeper
[2:57:43] cayna: PoE is bis
[2:57:46] cayna: I am offended
[2:57:48] FluffehZ: Poe is not bad, it's just not for everyone towSip
[2:57:58] Technogre: diabl LUL
[2:58:04] cayna: That's fair
[2:58:05] TheItalianStallion321: DEFINITELY not for everyone
[2:58:18] Haikonlol: Where can i get my sub back for this month? You are hallucinating!
[2:58:18] zgag: Tell that to Quinn
[2:58:21] zgag: p
[2:58:25] ForgottenTime: Towelliee throwing wild punches out here
[2:58:29] TheGiant99: PoE is not new player friendly
[2:58:32] Brodih_: I would play PoE if i did not feel like i have to take a 15h course on all the mechanics
[2:58:45] zgag: POE 2 will be something to check out
[2:59:00] Hodbroddpl: I go off to retail I need to do ksm there
[2:59:03] cayna: I am about to leave house sadly
[2:59:12] DeanoTV: i cant stand redoing the story over and over every league in POE ResidentSleeper
[2:59:13] cayna: It appears I ran out of food :D
[2:59:17] DeanoTV: thats why i dont play
[2:59:28] harver: Which build are you playing for brewmaster?
[2:59:39] hasan666: True KEKW
[2:59:42] Barret: thats subjective
[2:59:46] mewkittymon: Are you going to do a vid on the new dungeon?
[2:59:51] TwitchTronikk: How do you feel about Monk? Seems like a lot of players say its more complex and difficult
[2:59:51] zgag: POE isn't for super casuals that is true, but it's very playable by a new player. There are plenty of guides to check out that are well written
[3:00:08] Earsofpower: ah brh is out? is it a bigger one with way more trash than you will need for count? i just assumed from the name it would be that style
[3:00:10] Draz3nx: Poe is old boring piece of trash
[3:00:17] zgag: POE isn't for the LFR type crowd that is pretty much a fact
[3:00:19] FluffehZ: I think everyone will try Poe 2 when it releases towNod
[3:00:19] Korupcija_: that can be said about wow too KEKW
[3:00:25] ForgottenTime: Speaking of a towellie I‚Äôm gonna go get hiiiigh. Anyone wanna get hiiiiiigh
[3:00:28] Analfabestia: @Towelliee shouldn't roll be baseline instead of a talent linked to soothing mist?
[3:00:35] harver: How much damage does rising sun kick do for brew?
[3:00:38] frasidark: don't try to convince them about poe let them  dream on diablo :D
[3:00:41] Technogre: if you're new to poe all you have to do is find a build guide to help you learn the game and take it from there yourself I'm dumb and I learned poe
[3:00:56] nothumbgamer_ttv: the best "POE" was in destiny (prison of elders) that was super fun
[3:00:57] CYNIC308: do you have a Stagger bar? or are you using the icon by the minimap?
[3:01:01] QQisLIVE: Path Of Exile was much different 8-9 years ago. I found it way more enjoyable. They seem to be catering to the 1%ers and unfortunately the game is overfly fun to get that involved for newer players.
[3:01:12] QQisLIVE: isn't *
[3:01:20] harver: It has a modifier in the main tree to make it do more damage as well
[3:01:22] QQisLIVE: overly* jesus christ lol
[3:01:32] Draz3nx: I like poe but they don't change enough to make it differnet every league mechanic is similar
[3:01:34] Analfabestia: you should spec into the bonus damage for rising sun kick

[3:02:38] Analfabestia: yeah
[3:02:39] kokochris: POE's petty shots against Diablo shows how fragile they are danLUL
[3:03:02] Analfabestia: or vivify
[3:03:09] QQisLIVE: The crazy part is about PoE is if you go to the China side it has everything I've been craving for in PoE. Pets that collect loot, better quest rewards, more involvement etc. PoE is just a huge chore and makes me only want to run extremely strict filters to not see loot lmfao.
[3:03:11] Barret: so much poe hate, let people enjoy what they like
[3:03:13] CYNIC308: POE is all about choice ... you can literally make whatever class you want and that is why they feel superior to Diablo
[3:03:25] Analfabestia: how much damage it does now?
[3:03:31] Analfabestia: 17k?
[3:04:00] FluffehZ: i partially hate Wow towSip

[3:13:35] theoriginalzinng: yeah honestly i've given feedback that the 1 extra hit of revenge for 50% is duplicating based on the amount of mobs
[3:13:37] redbeard421: im enjoying my advance drinks. they all seem pretty good
[3:13:56] frasidark: compare it to a bear tank
[3:13:56] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:14:13] theoriginalzinng: pretty sure the seismic reverberation talent is broken in its intended functionality
[3:14:25] warrenny: @zgag Hows demo?
[3:14:33] theoriginalzinng: should be a revenge hit then only one more at 50% effectiveness how its worded
[3:14:41] arnell83: hunter or pala in new exp, and why? :)
[3:14:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Disco bear is awesome
[3:14:57] theoriginalzinng: but if there is 5 mobs it does that 5 times
[3:15:14] CYNIC308: how so? why? compare
[3:15:59] Zayvion: yea if you have the reduce cds for blackout kick then i dont see if you would have the gcds for the rising sun you might end up skipping it in some builds
[3:16:05] zgag: @warrenny Looks pretty good so far.  I would check out kalamazi stream to get a better viewpoint.  He's a good lock and streams Alpha

[3:16:52] Badziee: for me I think I'll play bear tank. never really played that spec. it seems easy enough to start some tanking :)
[3:16:56] thymos_: @zgag IT'S YOUTUBE
[3:17:11] icethousand: but is bear fun?
[3:18:20] Zayvion: iv played Brm since mists never went back to any other class as a main so there looks to be alot of really good talents here. There seems to be alot of if you want to be more tanky you miss out on damage and vice versa
[3:18:33] Highparkk_: how is brewmaster looking?
[3:19:09] warrenny: @highparkk_ Drunk
[3:19:10] raldrik: spin to win
[3:19:26] Highparkk_: @warrenny KEKW you're right

[3:20:57] dannyis1337: How‚Äôs the BM tree?  missed stream yesterday
[3:21:27] zgag: BM tree is looking better, but still needs lots of work
[3:21:30] captiv8: Your healer is almost oom
[3:21:35] TheNoobTaurenDruid: So far, which dungeon will be most challenging in high m+ in your mind?
[3:21:45] zgag: Hunter in general is lagging behind most classes on the Alpha
[3:22:01] nastygoogle: im looking into playing a tank next expac. what tanks seem fun
[3:22:03] Highparkk_: good, hunters have had their time to shine
[3:22:23] ohnot___her: @nastygoogle bear and monk imo
[3:22:50] thymos_: prot pally if you have a small peepee
[3:22:59] soge131: War Protect and Monks are the tanks I enjoy the most
[3:23:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tuskarrrrrrr
[3:23:13] Highparkk_: prot warriors as usual will be dog shit
[3:23:20] Highparkk_: prot warriors are the shunned tanks lol
[3:23:54] soge131: We were glorious for 2 patches in BfA, we're still paying for it
[3:23:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, Brewmaster dodges a ton
[3:24:14] CYNIC308: you dodge or THEY miss
[3:24:18] Highparkk_: exactly @soge131 i played the shit out of my prot warrior in bfa
[3:24:19] Roaringkittylol: Are we getting a Hogger Raid?
[3:24:32] CYNIC308: true
[3:24:35] thymos_: wearing leather in a world full of monsters monkaS
[3:24:53] CYNIC308: it should be up 99%
[3:24:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Hogger raid would be epic
[3:24:57] PastelByeol: uni1 Corgo1
[3:25:28] mikeygames: wait that was a boss, dropped so fast
[3:25:51] Roaringkittylol: That would be hilarious. Much needed laughter after the past 2 years. It could be a cool mini raid like ToTC - Ony - and other small raids.
[3:25:55] QQisLIVE: Do they plan to give you beta keys for giveaways in the future ?
[3:25:58] Strouss: how does the heal feel on Purify vs Keg?

[3:28:06] CYNIC308: ?

[3:29:45] captiv8: It probably isn‚Äôt accurate since you are stuck in combat the whole dungeon
[3:29:49] JuveLuL: How is Evoker looking on dmg so far? S tier?
[3:30:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Breath of fire!
[3:30:22] wowcore95: it's alpha, tuning is way later
[3:30:35] flebbooo: RSK honestly seems solid, maybe a bit much in heavy gcd builds but still nice
[3:30:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: It really is strange not to see keg smash as top dam
[3:31:03] CYNIC308: single target vs aoe tho
[3:31:04] geokouts: rising sun kick top dmg for ww
[3:31:06] Hyundrood: is special delivery not working?
[3:31:10] MaadMexx: spinning crane kick does 100% more dam with charred passions
[3:32:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah you have to use tiger palm regularly
[3:32:10] critin87: have we done demonhunters yet
[3:32:14] rockhell12: Do you think they should change that to stack to maybe 3 so you do your normal rotation and build up SCK?
[3:32:38] ohnot___her: @Hyundrood hes not running that
[3:32:52] Strouss: have you done weapon of order?
[3:33:15] Strouss: ahh
[3:33:20] imTymp: i think its not gonna be a massive difference which is nice that its a choice of playstyle and wont punish u too much for choosing diff choices
[3:33:23] TheItalianStallion321: @critin87 need new talent trees to do that
[3:33:40] critin87: ok ty
[3:34:06] CYNIC308: wtf is Effusive Anima Accelerator? LUL
[3:34:14] Strouss: shocking blow feel good it saounds odd to me lol
[3:34:19] critin87: so only the monk cool
[3:34:36] ohnot___her: @critin87 Every class tree is out minus DH
[3:35:14] critin87: even better
[3:35:19] Theliahh: yeah that's the mikanikos soulbind trait
[3:35:39] Theliahh: that's pretty nuts
[3:36:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah light brewing is important, I bet
[3:36:35] ohnot___her: I hate that last keg is all the way at the bottom
[3:36:47] mikeygames: Would you recommend brew? as someone who wants to get into tanking
[3:37:01] ohnot___her: @mikeygames its the most forgiving tank by far.
[3:37:13] raldrik: The loadouts and changes will be fun
[3:37:14] thebakeriscomingforu: the theorycrafters are going to have a great time with some of the talent trees.
[3:37:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: I heard a windwalker guy saying he wants stagger LUL
[3:37:34] thebakeriscomingforu: people like big numbers
[3:38:38] Strouss: shadowboxing is nice
[3:38:39] TheItalianStallion321: is it a 10% chance for both? or just the damage?
[3:38:43] Vaellder: If there's anything below it it's basically just a flat 30% damage increase to tiger's palm with some CDR
[3:38:45] ForgottenTime: You can take that point back for sure
[3:38:51] Strouss: ahh
[3:39:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, that cleave would be really nice
[3:39:08] Strouss: i know i love it in torghast lol
[3:39:27] Strouss: i love special delivery in certian keys
[3:39:57] Knocx: fun in wow, we dont dp that here
[3:40:04] Knocx: do
[3:40:45] kaybrink: what
[3:41:43] ForgottenTime: Do you feel any of these 2 point nodes should be one point? @towelliee
[3:42:25] rtucker04: Monk looking solid?
[3:42:26] Moobot: Read all about the new Auction House changes at https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23833174/shadowlands-927-update-notes
[3:42:27] Strouss: did they change the stat weights on Mastery for Brew?
[3:42:35] CYNIC308: is it good or bad that it feels like there are to many talents and not enough points?
[3:42:47] Kneckt: Cotton Candy flavor + milk, holy shit
[3:42:48] GamingDad77: Opinion time chat: Do you think Blizz will ever change the combat to be more spec focused. For instance tanks/healers doing less dmg but increasing dmg mitigation/healing? But in return dps doing more dmg and being more squishy

[3:45:49] HighThereBud: I smoked pot with Johnny Hopkins.
[3:45:56] DeanoTV: People have been crying about account wide for yearsss
[3:46:01] DeanoTV: rep
[3:46:30] AlphasaurusRexx: @hothotheals they said the dragonflgiht zones will essentially be similar to covenents. its just the new way they are expressing reputaion
[3:46:33] Peoplewhinetoomuch: My faction is the Horde SMOrc
[3:46:47] HotHotHeals: :(
[3:46:51] Theliahh: @hothotheals they're using the covenant renown system for dragonflight reputations
[3:47:02] DeanoTV: this is not covenant
[3:47:07] Eviltuna13: Say you can only get 2 rep points pre day on a toon. You can spam alts to max out the rep bar in a day
[3:47:08] DeanoTV: its renown, replacing reps
[3:47:11] DeanoTV: and account wide
[3:47:19] GamingDad77: @deliriumvoid you think they will ever go back to that model?
[3:47:28] backstreetalright: This is what it no turning back now Df is gonna make it or break it
[3:47:39] Gregadeaux: what addon does towelliee use to show the raiderio score on the dungeon search screen?
[3:47:50] Gillettefuzionz: @xxchaoticjessxx It nailed Wotlk, blizz announced it about 12 hours after leaks.
[3:48:05] AlphasaurusRexx: @Gregadeaux pretty sure that
[3:48:12] AlphasaurusRexx: @Gregadeaux pretty sure its base game
[3:48:19] HotHotHeals: Man i rather grind rep in dungeons like the old days rather then have daily chores to compete in end game
[3:48:23] Eviltuna13: So they can limit how much rep a account can get per week to solve that
[3:48:34] Gregadeaux: really. so elvui hides that?
[3:48:41] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @xxchaoticjessxx what is the date
[3:48:48] DeanoTV: @hothotheals u have classic for that
[3:49:00] AlphasaurusRexx: @Eviltuna13 same question. who cares if you get max rep in a day
[3:49:16] HotHotHeals: Im a 99 parser on tbc trust
[3:49:20] VoxDeMorte: yeah, i dont like metered progression
[3:49:23] Eviltuna13: Some people do
[3:49:32] DeanoTV: i dont get this lmao
[3:49:33] VoxDeMorte: why slow me down bc you cant keep up
[3:49:35] HotHotHeals: I was just hoping for something different this time aroubd
[3:49:35] AlphasaurusRexx: @Eviltuna13 youll be able to buy a mount faster than others. they said there is no power tied to the rep

[3:50:16] AlphasaurusRexx: @DeanoTV dude..so many doomers 24/7 lol
[3:50:31] Eviltuna13: @alphasaurusrexx I agree with you but there are people out there who will complain about anything
[3:50:37] AlphasaurusRexx: @rufphus yes
[3:50:39] rufphus: i understand it's not final but i haven't seen that UI element yet
[3:50:40] VoxDeMorte: i just hope this expac is ACTUALLY alt friendly LUL
[3:50:54] AlphasaurusRexx: @Eviltuna13 nobody cares about their opinion though
[3:51:03] DeanoTV: dragonriding talent system is account wide, renown (reps) is account wide
[3:51:06] HotHotHeals: The ui element was just allowing you to move your bars around
[3:51:07] DeanoTV: so will be alt friendly
[3:51:09] rufphus: @AlphasaurusRexx thanks for answering. once they make it look pretty that'll be neat

[3:51:21] VoxDeMorte: good
[3:51:43] AlphasaurusRexx: @rufphus so i kinda like that layout. i think if they added art to each of the colored bars it will look a lot better
[3:51:46] l_Phoenix_l: hi @ll
[3:51:48] thenormalbeast: Repos are not account wide?
[3:52:06] DeanoTV: they are in DF
[3:52:15] thenormalbeast: @DeanoTV ty
[3:52:21] rufphus: @AlphasaurusRexx i agree. i think, again once they make it look pretty, that'll be a nice way to quickly track things
[3:52:24] Theliahh: hopefully...
[3:52:56] DeanoTV: chat this is the new rep system, towel checked it on alts yesterday and it was account wide FailFish omg lol
[3:53:06] Eviltuna13: So only mounts and costume items for rep no gear or crafting patterns?
[3:53:11] AlphasaurusRexx: @rufphus im curious how they will correlate this rep with the 100 rep achievement. i assume max "renown" will be exalted
[3:53:23] Theliahh: he literally just said he isnt sure if it's account wide because all characters start at the same amount
[3:53:24] Deggon: so how goes the dragonflight, does it look like a good time to come back if Legion was last expansion I played
[3:53:43] DeanoTV: they confirmed it multiple times will be account wide
[3:53:56] AlphasaurusRexx: @Eviltuna13 we have no idea the rep rewards. they already said no player power tied to it though
[3:53:57] VoxDeMorte: i wanna see evoker gameplay, idek what its like
[3:54:14] Eviltuna13: Ok
[3:54:33] AlphasaurusRexx: @Eviltuna13 time will tell
[3:55:04] GamingDad77: @VoxDeMorte youtube it. there are tons if videos

[3:56:20] Eviltuna13: If they keep it just to mounts and transmog items it will be great but the second they add in gear or item level boosted gear from dailies I can see a shit show coming

[4:02:12] Shrenko: Arthas BibleThump invincible BibleThump
[4:02:13] lucid_wow: oh yeah SL wqs were fucking awful only good part is they werent really required at all, legion/bfa wqs were way better bc they took like 2 mins each

[4:04:30] magemaster225: its taking that long for druids
[4:04:36] volkreig: Imagine if glide is on the top and you have to use a point on it @Towelliee
[4:04:39] the_gody: what will take blizzard 3 months to figure it out tho
[4:04:41] bc_23_: New Faction system??
[4:04:42] JokaThS: the datamined stuff are pretty good tho for dh
[4:04:42] mikeygames: it'll just be 10 boxes in a vertical line with no branches.
[4:04:43] Shrenko: I think they are adding alot of stuff to DH this time, new buttons and stuff, reworked class with new abilities and rotations towCopium
[4:04:46] Strifelol: Did someone say DH tree :O?
[4:04:49] Masqerader: some of the early spells changes for DH look nice, the momentum change is pretty nice
[4:04:50] AlphasaurusRexx: @Eviltuna13 youre right, it looks like the 233 gloves isnt locked behind rep. but the cov rep gear was ilvl 200 and you can only get a couple items at that level. not really a huge powerspike there
[4:04:53] Arendiel_: DF delayed because of DH KEKWlaugh
[4:04:56] Katrikan: DH New Talent : Whenever you use Eye Beam you transform into a demon.
[4:05:06] mrrazputin: DH will be easy spend point to jump spend 2 points to double jump spend 3 points to glide :D
[4:05:14] Phil87z: Cries in Shadow priest
[4:05:26] Roaringkittylol: They need to just delete Feral, Demon Hunters, Engineering, add tank spec for evoker, and add the Tinker Class.
[4:05:27] Masqerader: DH- When you cast META - All Warlocks bitch on twitter
[4:05:37] CYNIC308: Demon Hunter Flight? that would be sick if they could fly like dragthyr
[4:05:50] Thoreya: im pretty sure the dev for priest/druid quit blizzard so
[4:05:50] mikeygames: What's your ilvl Towel?
[4:05:53] Thoreya: might have to wait a bit
[4:06:21] cinamonjackz: true, but it would still be nice to know why some talents are the way they are. making horse 4 points and spliting avenging wrath into 3 seperate nodes @Towelliee
[4:07:17] Arendiel_: the new thunder lizards are looking really cool, i hope they will be tamable
[4:07:47] cinamonjackz: like it just feels like some feedback is being ignored without haven given an explanation as to why
[4:08:24] apb89: Can goblins and worgen be monks in df
[4:08:28] CommanderKrano: please Blizz, add back Long arm of the law for paladins craft1Sad
[4:08:53] WhoIsAndrewJ: they can just pull the spell book and make them talents like they've done for all the other classes
[4:08:54] SilkeySmooth: 10 talents per node...lol
[4:08:55] Masqerader: delete warloicks and give DH a range spec :P
[4:08:56] Katrikan: ...give 2 more buttons to it?
[4:08:57] Roaringkittylol: Toss in legion legenary talens, azerite talents, and shadowlands conduit crapola
[4:09:03] ChumbaWumba6943: i think their best bet for dh is to use as many legendary item effects they've had and modify those where needed
[4:09:14] im_n0t_jezus: come up with something new lol or thats too much kek
[4:09:14] PToastman: night fae blade dance havoc represent

[4:10:24] CYNIC308: Demon Hunter is like dual wield glaive dancer slice n dice hero ... not that hard to flesh that out

[4:11:07] smol_gunner: watch blizzard make DH glide a talent KEKW
[4:11:10] Retpally9329: I wouldn't be surprised if those ideas were tossed around honestly
[4:11:12] SpyCrabbo: they could always go back to classics and put in nodes for secondary stats
[4:11:16] WhoIsAndrewJ: @Thoreya yep - they pulled abilities that aren't "talents" and made them optionable - instead of making just modifiers to talents/spells that we already have -
[4:11:18] im_n0t_jezus: LUL
[4:11:32] Tripnbunz: free guild point
[4:11:32] Warcraftthor: spec into removing trade chat

[4:11:59] AlphasaurusRexx: hey trade chat is respectable now
[4:12:08] DeanoTV: @angrymann420 its LITERALLY replacing rep and ACCOUNT WIDE
[4:12:09] Roaringkittylol: Unfortuantely, they are keeping the Renown System : /
[4:12:12] AlphasaurusRexx: channel 5 is the sesspool
[4:12:12] WhoIsAndrewJ: @Thoreya Feels cheap/lazy as a destruction warlock to have to "talent" in to get Curses/Demo Circle etc - And in Destro tree - it's a "talent" to get Chaos Bolt/ROF/Conflag - those are MAIN Destruction spells - shouldn't be talents imo -
[4:12:15] DeanoTV: u wished for that for YEARS
[4:12:22] TheLilBr0ski: looking to get away from Feral main any thoughts on Frost dk?

[4:12:56] Thewunk: Hey @towelliee how‚Äôs the Alpha this morning??
[4:13:01] newkingcody: @DeanoTV POGGERS
[4:13:02] Akuka_: @Thoreya Agreed big time, core abilities for over 10 years in some cases shouldn't be a forced talent choice because that's not a choice
[4:13:02] AlphasaurusRexx: i mean im tired of seeing boost spam so its a win for me
[4:13:07] Vilkanog: Thx for the info
[4:13:09] AlphasaurusRexx: feel free to keep channel 5 open
[4:13:15] Vile_: Them keeping Renown in DF is a good decision because we don't have to grind to exalted with four new factions. That's a GOOD thing.
[4:13:25] Caedranos: What new factions system?
[4:13:29] ZeroNpcTV: how was monk towel
[4:13:47] DeanoTV: they confirmed multiple times renown (reps ) will be account wide
[4:14:06] Funderik: would they not have the progress bar account wide too not just the level on renown?
[4:14:06] MimikTheMonk: I think Renown is a much better rep system. The old system was very outdated

[4:14:21] Vilkanog: @vile_ that‚Äôs what gave me a challenge back in older expansions. This new renown system is literally made for casuals
[4:14:22] AlphasaurusRexx: @DeanoTV there is still time for them to reconsider =P
[4:14:34] Roaringkittylol: Sure it does... however, Its annoying to have player power tied to it (Stamina).
[4:14:41] WhoIsAndrewJ: @Thoreya That's my problem with it - they pruned the spell book to give you "talents"
[4:14:55] Obidal: Hey @Towelliee When will we see your brewmaster in action in some dungeons :D
[4:14:58] Funderik: ion said renown was too
[4:15:02] TheLilBr0ski: Looking to get away from Feral main, thoughts on frost dk gameplay wise?
[4:15:06] Vile_: @angrymann420 Just because something takes a long time doesn't make it challenging. If you think time invested = challenging, you're mistaken. It's not "made for casuals," it's implementing what people have been clamouring for for a long, long time.
[4:15:06] Mitune: They have confirmed that Rep aside from ilvl increase things from those reps is account wide
[4:15:19] Wolfenhoof: @Funderik Ion said alot of things during the last 10 years.
[4:15:25] newkingcody: just because you had an ability for a long time doesnt mean your class cant be played without and replaced with a different choice
[4:15:30] strike879: with renown its also easier to add new rewards with rep there was no higher point then exalted
[4:15:31] newkingcody: so it is a choice
[4:15:39] Thoreya: renown shit people arent gonna believe till they see it in alpha
[4:15:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Spider cave?

[4:17:20] Vile_: @angrymann420 You may need to see it before judging it, but the Renown approach is better on all fronts. The "back in my day!" logic falls short, here.

[4:20:15] WhoIsAndrewJ: @Thoreya they're drinking the juice
[4:20:53] HyirGaming: Farming spot maybe?
[4:21:00] Akuka_: @Thoreya Honestly it's still better than what we've got so it makes it upsetting to be mad they could be better
[4:21:01] HyirGaming: Hmm maybe not
[4:21:31] MrSpicyJ: i feel like double keg smash should have been way higher in the tree since its something we are always taking anyway in both raid and M+
[4:21:50] Strouss: Does staggering strikes work well to reduce stagger?
[4:22:05] HyirGaming: He 2x keg smash shouldn't be a keystone as it is an 100% take

[4:23:20] Theliahh: @o_manolios_o_bixtis renown is good
[4:23:25] DeanoTV: @o_manolios_o_bixtis its rep
[4:23:39] o_manolios_o_bixtis: Ah rep is good
[4:23:44] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @yepclocc (warning)
[4:23:45] HyirGaming: Renown is great as a rep grind
[4:23:49] mavericks312: i would guess we get renown for future factions as well in patches
[4:23:49] Theliahh: renown is just rep with more defined levels so you get rewards more regularly
[4:23:57] Doublezoh: are there any other reps than the main ones for renown?
[4:24:03] akia03: no player power behind it right
[4:24:08] knyttneve: Do you think they will make reputation pre-DF account wide @Towelliee ?
[4:24:16] Theliahh: no player power besides very basic gear
[4:24:21] xmirrxrs: could be bugged
[4:24:24] Theliahh: but not gear you'll care about if you do dungeons/raids
[4:24:26] Xynthos_Gaming: just cosmetics

[4:25:00] Mitune: Everything is looking good though Preach was having issues with everything being just fill the bar or kill x things. Though the fun stuff maybe locked behind renown which is a bit dumb
[4:25:07] QQisLIVE: They just need to make more soulbound fishing items so the botters don't abuse it
[4:25:24] GamingDad77: fishing all day..cool. fished up ALL dalaran coins in one sitting

[4:27:44] mavericks312: have to equip it
[4:27:47] Scoodles91: rod must be equiped for stats
[4:27:48] lalelusa: read the wowhead post about the feast while you wait
[4:27:50] QQisLIVE: Check your fishing levels. I'm sure you have to equip
[4:28:23] SLoPPYALieN: .... why isn't blackout kick working?!?! oh fishing pole is equipped. :D
[4:28:28] Einzbern: Does the fishing pole not go in one of the profession equipment slots? I figured it would
[4:28:29] raldrik: start m+ with fishing pole, rip kiey
[4:28:40] QQisLIVE: Oh wow I didn't even notice the bar up there
[4:28:43] doomlolz: I wish they could add something new for each spec, not just SL abilities+some old legendary effects
[4:28:45] greekttv: just make a wa reminder Kappa
[4:28:46] PanoramicPanda: i am loving these new ui elements
[4:28:57] MrHI6HWAY: i did that in classic on my prot paladin. was not pleasent lmao
[4:28:58] Artiiz: Wish they‚Äôd add timer to the castbar
[4:29:16] AC1DNUK3: Seems like viable content to me, should do it lol
[4:29:23] PanoramicPanda: @Artiiz could be an option perhaps?
[4:29:30] akia03: start farming for it :)
[4:29:35] Mitune: Kinda wish they would go Stardew valley with the fishing
[4:29:39] Frank4LuLz: i still have the wrath daily in my bank
[4:29:48] greekttv: like an hour or two
[4:29:52] Tripl3dot: Should have to wear a fishermans hat during that sub goal
[4:29:52] Mecabeast: fishing Sundays coming back

[4:30:21] cruzeal: @byrdeen45 gz
[4:30:27] greekttv: for the legion fishing poll
[4:30:32] Xynthos_Gaming: any new dungeons with this alpha phase?
[4:30:36] JackedDown: Pvp in 2022 KEKW
[4:30:39] mavericks312: nobody cares about pvp lmao
[4:30:48] AlphasaurusRexx: @Xynthos_Gaming one new one
[4:31:02] Denohar: i live for world pvp
[4:31:08] Sprayz4dayz: new ui looking kinda nice
[4:31:10] Xynthos_Gaming: cool
[4:31:12] szble: if they're too good the pve only crowd will cry
[4:31:17] SpyCrabbo: i wouldn't even world pvp for mythic raid gear
[4:31:20] Are_Jealous: I really liked the supply drops
[4:31:21] Aquadriel: all BFA was godlike for world pvp
[4:31:21] GamingDad77: Servers can't handle full on world pvp
[4:31:27] memnon94: nazjatar world pvp was good
[4:31:27] endraax: this game was all about world pvp
[4:31:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: PvP is one of their three pillars of the game, it should get content added for itr
[4:31:29] Scoodles91: nazhatar reward were good and on reset they it was a masacre at the citys
[4:31:29] Mitune: Zerith Mortis just was awful on warmode
[4:31:40] Malivise70: But it‚Äôs just pure deathball
[4:31:41] Jollywhompus: @Towelliee I really liked the concept of BFA's treasure drops that you could chase down in PvP mode. For a map this size, it has to be something very specific map location
[4:31:43] cruzeal: i pvped for that conflict and strife essence
[4:31:52] raldrik: let them be able to grief each other they will fight
[4:32:00] trailerparkkgamer: war mode killed wpvp on my realm
[4:32:01] mavericks312: @endraax wow was never fully about pvp
[4:32:03] OGXanos: 10% xp isn't worth it if you get camped for more than 5 mins
[4:32:04] AlphasaurusRexx: @wEiRdO_dUdE some would say its a cosmetic pillar, and not a structural support pillar
[4:32:04] Jey1h: @endraax what game is this? Cause wow has never had world pvp as a main thing
[4:32:04] Luis_Simoes: xp 25 and gold
[4:32:11] Magdelia: cata was the last time pvp was fun
[4:32:14] yardmmada: Maybe in your circle. My whole guild plays for PvP.
[4:32:16] greekttv: world pvp is ass even if you like pvp
[4:32:17] OrieleHS: wow pvp is terrible. no chance i will do it, doesn't matter the rewards
[4:32:17] Thoreya: tbf pvp has been in the game since day 1
[4:32:25] isekmanek: Towelliee  world pvp is the reason why i stop played wow most
[4:32:30] Mitune: I mean only 6% do mythic raid
[4:32:31] Shattermare: Pvp is fun but deeply flawed and not worth doing long term
[4:32:34] Thoreya: and theyre adding solo que
[4:32:34] Templexx: its been teh same game modes and bgs forever.
[4:32:35] Thoreya: for 10.0
[4:32:40] OmgItsEdizzle: Think season 1.... EVERYBODY pvp'd....bc the juice was worth the squeeze for the gear
[4:32:41] Scoodles91: its not like they spend any development time on pvp to begin with :D
[4:32:42] mashiesmashie: I enjoy watching it but no interest in participating mysefl
[4:32:45] AC1DNUK3: Yeah it's very unfortunate how many people disregard WPVP nowadays, I personally love it, would enjoy seeing it make a comeback
[4:32:48] Templexx: if they actually update the bgs n stuff
[4:32:49] Jollywhompus: I wish the world had PvP only events on the map itself, like towers in TBC. Make various locations once every few hours so that pvpers can chase around the action and questers can join in when its favorable
[4:32:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: The PvP people want new or reworked BG's, too
[4:32:53] Mecabeast: maybe if world bosses were only available with wm on that'd be a reason?
[4:33:07] xhaven: the 1st week of season 4 envigorated pvp, because it gave players easier access to gear
[4:33:12] yepclocc: didnt holinka say theyre adding more incentives for warmode
[4:33:19] SpyCrabbo: then i would just stop doing world bosses
[4:33:29] lirly__: Ruin gaming will be out ganking lowbies levelling in warmode all expansion no doubt
[4:33:29] trailerparkkgamer: use to set up hellfire wpvp during mop and wod warmode its dead now
[4:33:31] Theliahh: wm incentives should be pvp related, not world bosses
[4:33:31] mavericks312: @Mecabeast you want riots huh lol
[4:33:32] xXArchilonXx: How much feedback is blizz not going to listen to this time?
[4:33:33] AlphasaurusRexx: Nazjatar WPVP was pretty fun
[4:33:34] Frank4LuLz: ya, but the streamers that i see at night, that pvp, arnt that good, except like Desiheat, she got personality
[4:33:37] casom2727: Even if you hate pvp, it is always fun to watch Mitch Jones
[4:33:37] Sprayz4dayz: a lot of changes to "force" people into wpvp would make less people want to play
[4:33:38] yaadaveyaa: @Towelliee which tank looks more promising for the next xpac, guardian druid or brewmaster monk?
[4:33:38] Overhaul_1229: if that was the case RUIN would wreck horde going for that lol
[4:33:39] greekttv: rbgs are fun but no one does them
[4:33:41] Unciatim: F warmode and pvp
[4:33:41] mrniceguy817: I turn warmode on when I want to be alone haha
[4:33:44] emznev: @Towelliee how long you going to play wotlk for?
[4:34:03] Redpandalol: Plus the toxicity in pvp kills it
[4:34:14] unholyshiz: the new gnoll sounds are  so good
[4:34:17] Jomuse92: I kinda want breath of fire as ww
[4:34:18] Roaringkittylol: Lol Warmode is great if your farming
[4:34:20] xanarel22: xanarel22 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! towByah
[4:34:22] Jomuse92: doesn't make sense but I want it
[4:34:50] Jey1h: I love both the new MW and new WW, and im now so torn between evoker and monk as a main xD
[4:34:51] Sprayz4dayz: @Jomuse92 what about aoe jade lightning instead
[4:34:53] CYNIC308: it seems blackout kick has more potential with the extra points spent
[4:35:23] OGXanos: "hammer of fuck yo face"
[4:35:29] TwoCenk: cata prot pala was really fun at BG's
[4:35:34] alwayspresto: your cata videos of throwing insane shield of the righteous at people was the best
[4:35:41] CYNIC308: remember when that Taugrim dude got 2400 with prot pally? LUL
[4:35:41] SpyCrabbo: i remember you doing pvp with corruptions in bfa
[4:35:49] nightkok: @Towelliee do you think with RSK reducing the amount of globals available you might be better off playing special delivery over RJW given that currently they do the same damage overall?
[4:36:00] greekttv: the cancer that is prot pally pvp metas
[4:36:18] OrieleHS: just means you have less free globals
[4:36:21] Jey1h: i think he means it eats up 1 gcd each 10 seconds
[4:36:25] nightkok: no i mean with an additional button to press every 10 seconds you have less free globals
[4:36:30] Jey1h: like it costs one gcd
[4:37:00] MrSpicyJ: brewmaster has some free gdc time tho
[4:37:05] Jey1h: BoK probably
[4:37:11] pickle_niik: hey chat i just get in what is the new faction systems?
[4:37:17] CYNIC308: yea RJW and RSK are globals for blackout kick or palm strike
[4:37:39] CYNIC308: blackout kick has quite a few talent modifiers
[4:38:18] Angxlic: these zones are so cozy
[4:38:22] SpyCrabbo: @HAmynamesNik you get rep but instead of the old friendly/honored it's renown levels now
[4:38:24] nightkok: you never want to miss a BoK or miss on SCK for the cdr though
[4:38:47] Shattermare: Do Brewmasters get Clash back?
[4:39:01] nightkok: special delivery on live does the same damage in a dungeon as rjw and with the additional brew cdr it's getting more strength
[4:39:07] MimikTheMonk: tuskarr feast nom nom
[4:39:34] BigHeroSixy: We have to cook. monkaSoap
[4:40:02] Xynthos_Gaming: wow

[4:55:12] Molvonos: It prolly scales up with the amount of people who put in materials
[4:55:12] Moose_Ka: Maybe cause its poor quality it doesnt give much
[4:55:13] OrieleHS: it will be better with higher levels of soup
[4:55:15] Arendiel_: it's a good buff for leveling tho
[4:55:19] EthicalHermit: It is probably better if the quality is higher
[4:55:34] Molvonos: So few people = poor quality, lots of people = excellent quality
[4:55:37] Zoludar: you said you got rep at the beginning
[4:55:47] Subjektive: wonder if it goes up to legendary quality

[5:20:51] Mecabeast: lightning bolt 360 are good
[5:21:24] TixesDT: IS dragonriding 100% on ground ?
[5:21:52] andre_scb: maybe its just larger fishing pools
[5:22:08] Teddymouse25: do you still need the old weather  beaten journal to track Fish pools?
[5:22:58] Zippaya: for next zone after
[5:23:04] Zippaya: 10.3 or so
[5:23:21] andre_scb: didnt we have track fish since classic?
[5:23:26] SpyCrabbo: you need to learn the ability to track fish from a book in vanilla
[5:23:27] Akuka_: Isn't that still a book?
[5:23:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Fish don't leave footprints!
[5:23:58] suvati68: Is that hud edit mode new or addon?
[5:24:10] Shrenko: just pay the Arenanet devs some good bucks to get the dragon riding right
[5:24:19] pumpkinking999: @towelliee look in spell book general
[5:24:48] Mitune: I think they have been just testing a whole bunch of different things with dragonriding. It seems each week they have changed something to get a response
[5:24:52] drazlok95: it's probably so they have something to "buff" in future patches

[5:26:18] swistedz: thats snow tho
[5:26:24] Jango_: are you sure its a literal hole and not just a place to fish?
[5:26:25] procyon_mfc: look for a pond?
[5:26:25] gratise: isnt the darker blue upnorth a frozen lake?
[5:26:25] andre_scb: im 100% sure the holes are just larger fishing pools
[5:26:30] Zippaya: its a snow you need ice
[5:26:33] GamingDad77: isn't ice usually above water?
[5:26:37] EthicalHermit: It could also just be NYI too
[5:26:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess we are looking for something similar to the school of fish
[5:26:47] Erohw666: idk... they steal breast milk, anything is possible these days
[5:26:51] Jango_: a fishing hole is traditionally a place you fish, not an acutal hole
[5:27:09] andre_scb: like new world...remember the larger fishing pool where everyone could fish?
[5:27:19] Akuka_: So dragonflying sucks now? One of the pillars of the xpac? Why does blizzard do this
[5:27:31] procyon_mfc: the hole would be there but it just wouldn't be interactable for them
[5:27:36] AmiTeufel: might be a hole in a patch of ice - like where you are exactly
[5:27:43] ChaosRaiser327: Has Blizzard said anything about reworking Fishing like the other professions or is it staying as it is?
