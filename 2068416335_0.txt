[0:19:17] Jaythebard: One time Dan said "Hey, Jay, high five?" and i was sadly dissapointed that there was no number 5 that was high at all
[0:19:20] Jaythebard: What a liar

[0:39:09] Akela3: 9.5/10
[0:39:15] mikeygames: how much was it?
[0:39:17] Lausten: All things brown/baise is what makes life worth living Kappa
[0:39:19] Layliah79: i had fish filets, coleslaw and hushpuppies for dinner last night
[0:39:50] NeeK_23: £25!!!!!!!!!!! robbery
[0:39:59] mikeygames: that's cheap compared to here
[0:40:08] Annathebanana1986: my local chip shop was doing battered brussel sprouts at xmas, they were to die for
[0:40:12] Layliah79: was it worth it?
[0:40:55] Annathebanana1986: anything in batter is good
[0:41:35] AlanC2024: chips in my village cost £80 roughly for chips jumbo sausage in batter and curry
[0:41:43] AlanC2024: 8 i menat
[0:41:56] mikeygames: a large cod in my chip shop on it's own is £9
[0:42:00] AlanC2024: 8 quid i meant :P
[0:42:17] Elrathir: So it's the first time I'm questing throught the classic zones since Cata hit. I'm like "Holy shit they put a lake in Loch Modan!!"
[0:42:37] SirRobHiFi: read the small print, the fish is usually no longer cod
[0:42:40] Elrathir: I have, but it's been so long lol
[0:43:00] Elrathir: the sight caught me by surprise
[0:43:04] NeeK_23: Plaice
[0:43:16] NeeK_23: or Hake
[0:43:36] AlanC2024: I can get Plaice, haddock, cod, pollock. I live in cornwall near a fishing town
[0:43:56] NeeK_23: everywhere in the UK is 70miles from the sea, its usually from northsea fish
[0:44:01] SlithTheSivak: wouldnt most of ur fish be caught by british fishermen now that ur out of the EU
[0:44:32] SlithTheSivak: no fish for u!
[0:44:35] NeeK_23: we had a "war" with Iceland over fish
[0:44:58] NeeK_23: fisherman fighting and ramming each other
[0:45:12] Lausten: UK aint got Trump as their leader..
[0:45:22] Lausten: So they are allowed to trade with other countries :D
[0:45:28] Madve: cuz ppl are braindead, just dont mind them
[0:45:32] NeeK_23: its called the Cod War
[0:45:32] Madve: legit room temp IQ ppl
[0:46:16] AlanC2024: honestly most people who make wow videos make the thumbnails look good and people say its clickbait
[0:46:30] SlithTheSivak: im pretty excited for Dorn if for no other reason than we can make GoT references all day
[0:46:57] SlithTheSivak: The Dornishmans Wife is like a running joke in GoT
[0:47:15] SirRobHiFi: I heard they are closing down The History Channel because it's all old information and therefore pointless.

[0:49:00] SlithTheSivak: absolutely
[0:49:11] SlithTheSivak: him and asmon are getting skewered on reddit right now
[0:49:16] StreamElements: EARLY LOOK at Khaz Algar Zones in The War Within (Pre-Alpha) - https://youtu.be/XbrZRxCSM50
[0:49:32] SlithTheSivak: they put out a video about how war withing was already over
[0:49:34] Madve: wait what did i miss? xd
[0:49:34] AlanC2024: i seen a comment on wowhead that said that the new capital in the war within is harder to pronounce than Thaldrasus. I don't have trouble
[0:49:43] kaijoe_: They're just begging for crumbs of engagement lol
[0:50:24] NeeK_23: I mean pick stupid Thumbnails and Titles like "War With is Dead" and expect dumb reactions
[0:51:04] Larkaro: is War Within really "over"
[0:51:31] AlanC2024: the devs for oracle priest who had the interview with tali and other priest players said that they have other ideas if its needed. The devs are more open to us now
[0:51:31] xmalthael02: I really like the idea of hero talents, i want to see the warlock ones next

[0:52:25] ArcavusX: 2 Hour Mainetenance - CRIES in Sad
[0:52:47] NeeK_23: Bell's video titles have poisoned the wow discourse for so long now. He knows what he (or his team) are doing. It doesnt matter if the content of the video is positive, most people only see the thumbnail and dont watch
[0:53:05] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:53:35] dright424: I am pretty sure they want a ton of feedback. They have been changing DF's talents a ton based on feedback.
[0:53:50] Lausten: Clips
[0:53:54] dright424: @NeeK_23 I think people more have issue with Asmon's reaction video title
[0:55:43] SlithTheSivak: asmon said he makes more on reaction videos than he does playing games
[0:56:22] Lausten: I agree with Belluar on his view about the talents. I havent watched Asmongolds reaction to it, which is people most mad about?
[0:56:23] dright424: A large amount of the online discourse around WoW is by ex-wow players, so they just go based on what they see other people saying
[0:56:26] Raxus: People click on it, thats all that matters.  If you dont like it, you can ignore it on youtube..
[0:58:37] Rexy95: what server ya on mate ? :)
[0:59:10] Rexy95: how much gold you in need of ? :D
[1:00:02] ArcavusX: Servers down for maintenance for 2 hours, how do I log into EU servers now? Lol
[1:00:19] mikeygames: To answer your question Dan, no you can't get to exalted with Azerothian
[1:00:27] mikeygames: I turned in 30 boxes and nothing ha
[1:00:28] Rexy95: well i got 172 :P and i dont really find it hard to make it :)
[1:00:44] Rexy95: mining ;)
[1:01:09] mikeygames: I'm personally farming solid chests, then Ah'ing all the crap
[1:01:29] Rexy95: mithril was selling for like 4-8g a stack xD
[1:01:29] mikeygames: I'm getting about 20+ solid chests/hour give or take, maybe more
[1:01:39] mikeygames: problem is inventory keeps filling up so I've bought 14 slot bags
[1:01:53] Lausten: Strength still gives you attack power, just half as much as from agi if I recall correctly
[1:02:08] Vesamora: Sorry for the bother. Was that Phase 2 BIS tag on the tooltip of that sword from an addon, or do you have an addon that allows you to add manual tags?
[1:02:27] Rexy95: the other way around @Lausten  agi just gives crit aswell :)
[1:02:46] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:03:03] Lausten: @Rexy95 Ah is that it, been ages since I played classic :D
[1:03:26] Vesamora: Ah nice, cheers.
[1:05:05] CrowMomocle: oh that's great!
[1:05:23] CrowMomocle: The sucky thing is if there is a chain
[1:05:23] Lausten: Thats awesome to hear, hope you find a buyer
[1:05:38] CrowMomocle: like your house sells but you don't have new house
[1:06:10] CrowMomocle: but, if you get a good deal selling you could temp put stuff in storage and live in temp place
[1:06:51] CrowMomocle: hopefully the house you find and love doesn't have long waiting for it
[1:07:32] CrowMomocle: I've been in process of moving and it happens Thursday, trying not to stress

[1:09:04] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:09:08] SinicalDev: Might just be people are wanting to be hyped but if its not new stuff thats been revealed since blizzcon then someone might feel duped a bit but thats their problem
[1:09:09] Katariatv: i miss class halls
[1:09:57] xmalthael02: I LOVED class halls wish they could find a way to use it again
[1:10:16] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies 🧡 https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[1:10:30] mikeygames: keep making them, yolo!
[1:11:21] BBMezzy: Class halls were great because it meant there was so much content to play
[1:12:21] xmalthael02: I wouldn't mind if the class hall were player housing
[1:12:26] SinicalDev: they should really repurpose them as like flavour/fantasy building for the levelling process, like use it as a hub to learn things about your class and the game mechanics like the proving grounds
[1:12:36] mikeygames: there's also an achievement to do all twelve campaigns
[1:12:59] Lausten: Yeah it goes 1 3 12 I think
[1:13:02] shax_livee: Hey buddy how we doing
[1:13:19] Aenaphos: I appreciate the pre-alpha content. I like sharing upcoming content with friends to see if they'd be willing to come back to the game.   They have no desire to skim through all the Blizzcon content to find the info themselves.
[1:13:22] shax_livee: Am good thanks just finshed work at home
[1:13:41] Lausten: Im a top 1k DFA collector and I've only ever done 3/12 class halls.. I've been slacking so much..
[1:13:52] Lausten: Literally so much content
[1:14:10] BBMezzy: Maybe see how you're feeling tomorrow
[1:14:29] fooxytv: was sad to hear they will be no more tickets for LFG :(
[1:14:31] SinicalDev: Do you have any idea when Alpha may be dropping, excited to see what you discover
[1:14:50] NeeK_23: top 1k ??? damn @Lausten
[1:15:28] Lausten: @NeeK_23 Yeah I know, casual slacker
[1:15:34] SinicalDev: Maybe next time you should make it paid but then provide a goody bag or something that has that value if you dont want to make a profit
[1:16:19] shax_livee: It is what it is buddy you thought not many people would come but it turned out alot did want to come just concentrate on the event and do bigger next time now you know numbers
[1:16:23] ruuhll: Upps wrong chat
[1:17:25] Lausten: Hey, its a positive that so many people instantly wanted the tickets, take that as a W
[1:17:30] mikeygames: Dan
[1:17:31] shax_livee: Just don't be bumbed our that you couldn't get more people it not your fault mate 👍
[1:17:34] mikeygames: I'll invite you we are doing the riders now
[1:18:32] Gordiie: What Zygor module is it that has all the SoD stuff?
[1:19:03] Gordiie: oh nice
[1:19:45] Gordiie: same way people figured out the paladin rune that you need to swim for legitimately 20 minutes to get to
[1:19:47] mikeygames: 4
[1:19:50] Gordiie: insanity lol
[1:21:05] K0rzak0v: how does your SoD ui look like retail? or am i confused
[1:21:29] Davinah_00: @K0rzak0v you can find an ad on for almost anything lol
[1:22:19] K0rzak0v: looks good
[1:23:49] mikeygames: magic prob
[1:23:54] mikeygames: you get a debuff
[1:24:07] mikeygames: it's called dark presence
[1:24:36] mikeygames: Each Dark Rider has about a 5-minute respawn timer, so players won't have to wait long if they cannot find one.
[1:25:19] mikeygames: the other 2 have done this one, I joined then mid, they are waiting at the next

[1:28:43] RAF_Sean: Good morning Legend
[1:28:59] RAF_Sean: How's SoD treating ya?
[1:29:10] SuperLost89: 30% i think, but apparently you want to use the beast mastery one and keep your pet, but thats just from what ive heard
[1:29:15] Lausten: And that kids is how your dad went from being a hunter to being a warrior again.. Kappa
[1:29:20] RAF_Sean: Ain't that the way
[1:29:29] RAF_Sean: I also had more fun when I was 25 than I had when I was 40 ;)
[1:31:19] SuperLost89: i hope blizzard buffs some of the lacking runes soon. also for the melee rune, you'll want to use 2 of the same weapon type for 30% increased damage from raptor strike (boot rune)
[1:31:41] SuperLost89: oooh yea! that would be sick
[1:32:46] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM

[1:34:01] Ambersulfr: hater
[1:34:13] RAF_Sean: Just reply with 'Bye Felicia'
[1:34:14] faelidah: I mean it does say pre-alpha. What did they expect?
[1:34:16] StreamElements: EARLY LOOK at Khaz Algar Zones in The War Within (Pre-Alpha) - https://youtu.be/XbrZRxCSM50
[1:35:05] BBMezzy: (Blizzcon + Interview Summary)? Can't make it clearer than that
[1:35:14] Lausten: (Dont watch if you're a cunt)
[1:35:33] faelidah: I mean Pre-Alpha basically just means Pre-Alpha. What did they really expect? lmao
[1:35:55] BBMezzy: Yea it does.. people are just starved for new WoW info
[1:36:04] mikeygames: should troll them with a video of the midnight expansion and just have the 'expansion logo' on screen
[1:36:10] Larkaro: Put a giant stamp on the thumbnail saying [PRE-ALPHA]. That will just those dogs up
[1:36:21] SuperLost89: EARLY LOOK at Khaz Algar Zones in The War Within (Pre-Alpha Clickbait)   lol
[1:36:34] SuperLost89: that will get them going
[1:36:39] mikeygames: don't forget the red circle and arrow
[1:36:40] faelidah: Ngl I only wanna know what pets they gonna bring out. I really want another spirit beast pet ngl
[1:36:46] Jack_the_Dipper: Not-yet-Alpha Kappa
[1:36:54] Jack_the_Dipper: manthiWave
[1:36:56] Larkaro: POST ALPHA
[1:36:58] DevoidX: i think it sort of indicates that 'pre-alpha' is some kind of testing phase that you are privy to. can't legislate for peoples ignorance
[1:37:35] SuperLost89: (Open Beta Notes)
[1:37:35] faelidah: Petopia has about 1500 pets on its site lmao Makes you wonder how many the new expansion will have.
[1:37:48] DevoidX: perhaps say 'prior to alpha'
[1:38:06] Jack_the_Dipper: Alpha Male
[1:38:06] mikeygames: it's about time Blizzard let us transmog our pets with 'skins' so we can collect all the skins
[1:38:41] NeeK_23: tbh one guy in the comments has a decent lore theory that seems at first glance to be good
[1:38:50] Lausten: If people cant read a title then they cant be reasoned with either, just ignore them
[1:39:00] faelidah: I mean pre-alpha kinda just states everything that the people will only know (Which is barely any) before Alpha launches tbh
[1:39:30] faelidah: Exactly. Its mainly just a catch up tbh
[1:39:59] faelidah: The pet stables should have at least 40 pages. 20 stable pages isn't enough
[1:40:05] BBMezzy: Like a pokeball going to the pc

[1:41:01] Lausten: https://civxl.net/
[1:41:37] Lausten: Imagine if he could collect them all without needing x number of hunters cause there was actually a system like that in the game.. That would be awesome. The Hunter Stable really need a rework!
[1:43:02] faelidah: Yeah Hati you could purchase an item to ride him for an hour or so.

[1:45:15] Lausten: Gotta push for that stable rework into the Barbershop just like Warlocks got
[1:46:27] OatsMate: But what if they add pet special abilities back for the third time?
[1:47:26] Jack_the_Dipper: you cant produce milk?
[1:47:39] Jack_the_Dipper: Everyone should have a cow
[1:47:47] OatsMate: I like the ability to res and bloodlust without needing others, but some of the other abilities are just too PvP focused.

[1:48:21] OatsMate: no
[1:48:26] Goblocker: that sounds awful
[1:48:30] faelidah: There is only one way to find out
[1:48:32] faelidah: Give it a try lmao
[1:48:32] Jack_the_Dipper: nah
[1:48:36] OatsMate: You might hear colors for a few hours, though..
[1:48:43] bojackhorseman2004: Hello MrGm
[1:48:44] Lausten: You'll just be a bit more jittery
[1:48:53] CrowMomocle: Just don't add strong coffee to it, sounds lovely
[1:48:55] bojackhorseman2004: is your new preview video just from blizzcon?
[1:48:57] Jack_the_Dipper: YOu are replacing a bit of cofee with the stuff
[1:48:57] CrowMomocle: but then I love coffee
[1:48:58] OatsMate: Or you could just heat up the pumpkin spice coffee...
[1:49:43] bojackhorseman2004: Ok, ngl a tiny bit dissepointed when it says its a zone preview
[1:49:52] bojackhorseman2004: since you showed the same videoclips in previous videos
[1:50:01] Jack_the_Dipper: @MrGM you have some chocolate? Put some chcolate in the cofee
[1:50:14] faelidah: Can't lie, I actually like the new zones. Design wise and color wise tbh seems interesting to explore
[1:50:15] bojackhorseman2004: I am just giving honest feedback, i like allot of your videos :)

[1:50:17] BisonD: put a tab of butter in the coffee
[1:50:30] Lausten: Which commenter are you on YouTube? @bojackhorseman2004 Kappa
[1:50:32] bojackhorseman2004: Oh ok, nvm then xd
[1:50:32] mikeygames: put a cream egg in the coffee
[1:50:48] Jack_the_Dipper: @BisonD o yeah some butter could work
[1:51:11] demololtv: what up dan
[1:51:25] bojackhorseman2004: @Lausten i havent commented on youtube
[1:51:42] bojackhorseman2004: as i said i am not a hater, but i think its important to give honest feedback.
[1:51:47] Diathros: !fight
[1:51:50] bojackhorseman2004: I can talk about videos i really like
[1:52:41] Lausten: @bojackhorseman2004 Just taking the piss, hes just had a few angry comments about unsubbing and such 5 minutes after the video was out, I bet some of them didnt even watch the entire thing..
[1:52:44] bojackhorseman2004: "EVERYTHING Coming in Patch 10.2.5 "Seeds of Renewal" |"
[1:53:04] bojackhorseman2004: I really like this video, becuse its very nice to see if you want to come back in a patch
[1:53:12] adampanerabread: well he did mention pre-alpha in the title. there's literally no other way that he could have different footage other than what's seen at blizzcon, and not everyone watched the blizzcon preview
[1:53:22] bojackhorseman2004: and get everything in one place instead of having to dig in wowhead
[1:53:36] bojackhorseman2004: also mrgm has really good "visuals" for hes video its always clean
[1:54:28] bojackhorseman2004: @Lausten I didnt know before i joined stream :)
[1:54:51] faelidah: I mean Pre-Alpha kinda states, before Alpha. It just shows to the crowd whats known as of current before Alpha launches.
[1:55:20] faelidah: Is it any good tho? lmao
[1:55:29] faelidah: lmao
[1:56:36] Lausten: Gotta put a disclaimer on future videoes.. "May contain information you already know if you're watching too many wow content videos" Kappa
[1:57:04] bojackhorseman2004: When it says "pre alpha" I am thinking, maybe its non blizzcon footage but from a datamine or insider info. If it said "blizzcon footage" i wouldnt think it might be new footage
[1:57:26] bojackhorseman2004: I am not saying its logical, i am saying its how my brain thinks when i see the thumbnail and title
[1:58:19] bojackhorseman2004: I think you should do that, but write in the title "blizzcon footage" or somthing
[1:58:23] fooxytv: WoW community for you..
[1:58:30] bojackhorseman2004: so people who watched it already knows, and people who hasent wont care
[1:58:52] bojackhorseman2004: i mean instead of "pre alpha"
[1:59:04] bojackhorseman2004: "pre alpha" can mean from secret source or blizzcon
[1:59:14] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Maybe at the end of title, put in parenthesis "Blizzcon footage", and if that's not clear for people, I don't know what is
[1:59:17] fooxytv: you need your mods to manage your youtube etc so they can remove the troll comments
[1:59:29] chelfx: it has blizzcon watermark on it
[1:59:52] chelfx: in the top corner
[2:00:02] AlfredK: What happened?
[2:00:07] bojackhorseman2004: True, but for zones we kinda just wanna see how they look and feel. But please dont, not upload somthing becuse of this
[2:00:12] bojackhorseman2004: since its just a missunderstanding
[2:00:22] fooxytv: I was looking forward to the class shorts
[2:01:15] bojackhorseman2004: how long are we from actual alpha? not far
[2:01:25] bojackhorseman2004: so then its like a sea of content
[2:01:27] Ambersulfr: *pat pat*
[2:01:29] OatsMate: my condolences, I feel your pain.
[2:01:48] fooxytv: I know it's easy for me to say it, but don't let online trolls bring you down <3
[2:01:48] Ambersulfr: give everyone who makes you sad a 24-hour timeout
[2:01:59] bojackhorseman2004: I feel so shit now >_<
[2:02:07] Ambersulfr: they can come back tomorrow

[2:04:42] bojackhorseman2004: :O old god confirmed!
[2:04:51] mikeygames: "War Within Ending Cinematic - Pre Alpha"
[2:04:59] OatsMate: I can't wait for the WW book, hopefully it's good.
[2:05:03] ratgefingah: im fuckin in love with isle of dorn
[2:05:16] Ambersulfr: click bait is thrown around too much as a term, you said what's in your video... that's not click bait imo
[2:05:24] Lausten: Thats waht I thought when I read the title, you were just making a video to sum up what have been forgotten since Blizzcon, I follow the news quite a bit, and was not  expecting to see any new footage from an expansion thats not in alpha yet..
[2:05:24] ratgefingah: and hallowfall is amazing too
[2:05:30] bojackhorseman2004: I am really excited, becuse tbh i got dragon fatigue
[2:05:32] Ambersulfr: click bait is saying you've got pre-alpha info and talking about current release info
[2:06:34] Goblocker: I'm pretty happy we will have flying at the start
[2:06:36] ratgefingah: I skipped the whole presentation at bcon /didnt play at the time) so ur vids r perfect for me to catch up
[2:07:20] ratgefingah: atleast u dont title ur vids "war within is dead" Kappa LUL
[2:07:27] Calicice12: Hey Dan, just saw your WW video. Enjoyed the recap
[2:07:49] Lausten: Its news frustration, we are news starved cause we are all just waitng for alpha release date
[2:07:54] Goblocker: any ideas on when we might get more WW info from Blizz
[2:07:59] AlfredK: Probably just people who assumed there was some new footage and then got pissed off

[2:08:30] BBMezzy: Those are crumbs
[2:08:37] bojackhorseman2004: Alpha comes close after pirate flag patch, and pirate flag patch they said is comming next month
[2:09:02] Calicice12: Those new priest "PI" hero talents look gross
[2:09:09] bojackhorseman2004: I was hoping early march for pirate flag and late march for alpha
[2:09:11] bojackhorseman2004: but who knows
[2:09:14] Jack_the_Dipper: Maypril
[2:09:54] fooxytv: is it confirmed pirate patch? for 10.2.6?
[2:10:12] bojackhorseman2004: it could be a bait, but the community wouldnt take it kindly
[2:10:15] Goblocker: I can't wait for Hearthstone event so many cool rewards
[2:10:19] fooxytv: or are they just messing with everyone?
[2:10:24] mikeygames: Pirate Class
[2:10:28] Lausten: It would be weird if its not pirates since they keep posting it, honestly I think they would make people very very dissapointed if its not pirates
[2:10:46] BusterDonuts: @MrGM I have a few ideas you should tweet about at warcraft devs. 1. Warlock glyph for randomized demon customizations. 2. Bring back Resto Druid form / customizations. 3. Let me dungeon que on my main, and let me logon to an alt and level while I'm waiting for my que to pop. 4. Love rocket drop rate increase mechanic, basically each toon you do adds a .5% to drop rate. so if you have 20 alts, by the end of the 14 days you should have your mount.
[2:10:53] bojackhorseman2004: Tbh no matter what it is, idk if it can live up to expectation. We have a tendency to think to big whenever we have close to no info
[2:11:39] adampanerabread: jesus christ
[2:11:46] RAF_Sean: I honestly don't think people know what 'clickbait' means
[2:12:13] RAF_Sean: Either they can't read and comprehend 'pre-alpha' or they don't know what 'clockbait' is. Either way they are very low quality humans
[2:12:17] bojackhorseman2004: Rdruid custemization should had happend already, wierd it hasent
[2:12:21] bojackhorseman2004: with the boomkin one
[2:12:50] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Pretty sure people going for rocket are already doing degenerate behavior KEKW
[2:12:51] Pathstrider: needs to be increased tho, not getting it after 14 years is insane
[2:13:12] Uchiha_Cloaky: snupyHey
[2:13:19] BBMezzy: That's how it should have been implemented from the get-go
[2:13:23] Milanesa_De_Pollo: But bad luck protection for mounts with low drop rate would be good.
[2:13:24] BusterDonuts: They need to just remove the buff timer... like theres toys that have permanent buffs.... just remove the time duration
[2:14:36] bojackhorseman2004: i dont even know what that toy is
[2:14:40] Lausten: They just need to always have the toy CDs being half the time of the duration of toys
[2:15:07] Goblocker: lowering the cd on stampwhistle would be nice
[2:15:12] BBMezzy: Was endless possibilities a 10.2.5 item?
[2:15:26] BBMezzy: Well that explains it, made by the intern
[2:15:35] BusterDonuts: @MrGM did you happen to see, one of the community members posted about an addon called Sorted. it's sooo nice for organization.
[2:16:05] BusterDonuts: retail, not sure if it's for sod or classic
[2:16:07] mikeygames: @BusterDonuts that the one that changes merchant frames?
[2:16:32] Lausten: @BusterDonuts I saw Soul use it, I personally dont like a list of text, im better with icons
[2:16:41] BusterDonuts: @MrGM soulsobreezy
[2:17:11] Arascayn: And why isnt auto loot pre selected in the settings
[2:17:27] moriartiphd: Vendors were fine in Legion. But then they broke them in BFA.
[2:17:35] mikeygames: more like why is the services channel on by default
[2:17:43] Arascayn: Ah okay
[2:18:32] Lausten: Icons is better than lists
[2:18:35] BusterDonuts: Takes some getting use to I was the same way :D
[2:18:46] ratgefingah: jo what is this
[2:18:46] BusterDonuts: you can add an "Age" too

[2:33:35] Okami_117: the meds tbh
[2:33:55] Okami_117: so whatcha doing?
[2:34:32] bojackhorseman2004: I really hope in twilight when we go back to qualthalas that they remake all of northern eastern kingdom, bigger and dynamic flight worthy. Instead of intreducing new islands and continents
[2:34:39] thegnomeking775: Good morning!
[2:34:41] SuperLost89: you get a lot of gold from the quests as well which is nice
[2:34:43] bojackhorseman2004: midnight* yes xD
[2:35:07] Goblocker: I would just like to fly in Silvermoon and BE zones
[2:35:13] bojackhorseman2004: 1 xpac northen eastern kingdom, 1 xpac for southern eastern kingdom and 1 expac for all of kalimdoor
[2:35:26] mikeygames: this sync feature is great on Zygor
[2:35:38] bojackhorseman2004: yeah, so this has to happen after the world soul saga
[2:36:11] SuperLost89: click bait video lol
[2:36:12] Lausten: He even showed Blizzcon video
[2:36:37] Lausten: Glow ups?

[2:37:52] bojackhorseman2004: That dosnt sound like what i was talking about
[2:37:58] bojackhorseman2004: they done "glowup" loads
[2:38:05] bojackhorseman2004: like when they burned down the tree
[2:38:30] faelidah: So its gonna be a mini cata with  the revamp for those zones
[2:38:53] Lausten: Glow ups with dragon riding is gonna feel weird, I guess they need to remake the zones to be larger
[2:39:06] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:39:45] LuiBMHunter: maths is hard
[2:39:54] Okami_117: I wanna fly in Quel'thalas dang it (also i miss my alts so bad.... left the game back in 2020) cheer50
[2:40:09] Okami_117: My alts are my precious little babies...
[2:40:16] SuperLost89: if you kill near the loa, you get triple the coins
[2:40:34] bojackhorseman2004: Thing is, do we know in what form we are gonna visit qual thalas? might be karazan style where its just an instanced raid :(
[2:40:42] Okami_117: So they didn't get deleted?
[2:41:27] LuiBMHunter: back where you were *snicker*
[2:41:28] Okami_117: promise?
[2:41:34] Katariatv: do we know the name of the first raid next expansion
[2:41:59] Katariatv: xD
[2:42:07] mikeygames: I hope we get the Arathi as an allied race
[2:42:16] bojackhorseman2004: Any good guesses of last boss of warwithin?
[2:42:29] Okami_117: a friend says theirs's were after two years away from the game for "data saving purposes"
[2:42:40] thegnomeking775: @mikeygames Same!
[2:42:41] Lausten: @bojackhorseman2004 Pretty sure they already said they are gonna remake something like the upper top of Eastern Kingdoms.. I imagined something like from Thandol Span (where Wetlands bridge into Arathi) and up..
[2:42:56] LuiBMHunter: nah afaik blizzard never delete toons
[2:43:05] mrsrockguru: Yeah and that boss in the preview was a light paladin in that arathi dungeon
[2:43:10] Jack_the_Dipper: Jailor 2.0 end boss Kappa
[2:43:29] mikeygames: characters DO get deleted well purged, if you have a character deleted for a while, it'll eventually get purged from the database.
[2:43:29] LuiBMHunter: just log in and see  -don't need a sub to log in
[2:43:51] bojackhorseman2004: @Lausten yeah, but there is a massive diffrence between the way they remade some zones in bfa. Or like a level zone area
[2:43:53] Okami_117: I stopped the sub
[2:43:57] mikeygames: I deleted my warrior a while ago, can't be restored as it's been purged from the database
[2:44:02] Okami_117: my friend did something else
[2:44:11] bojackhorseman2004: I twilight to happen and we level from 80-85 in northedn eastern kingdom
[2:44:35] bojackhorseman2004: then 85-80 in northrend
[2:44:41] bojackhorseman2004: 85-90*
[2:44:44] Lausten: @mikeygames People have had their characters all the way from back in classic have had their characters restored. I think the cut off is level 10 and below always gets deleted straight away..
[2:44:51] mikeygames: I'll level in party sync and chromie time and smack rares, like always
[2:44:57] bojackhorseman2004: I have no idea, but i would like 5 levels
[2:45:03] Jack_the_Dipper: I wish they updated the chat system and settings
[2:45:20] Jack_the_Dipper: I hate it I can setup a global chat setting
[2:45:22] Okami_117: Think the Stormwind graphics will be updated too?
[2:45:24] Jack_the_Dipper: can't
[2:45:35] nevillethewizard: @mrgm Disappointed the love rocket didn’t drop again this year. ugh.
[2:45:39] bojackhorseman2004: @Elkhuntsman yes, its a sub to play game
[2:45:53] nevillethewizard: nope
[2:46:05] bojackhorseman2004: Do you know who Doronsmovies are? and what do you think of the videos he makes
[2:46:19] Lausten: @Jack_the_Dipper Yeah the chat settings should be part of the editmode, but I guess it aint cause its actually running seperate to the ingame servers..
[2:46:31] Jack_the_Dipper: No, I mean I need to do for every character chat changes
[2:46:33] nevillethewizard: @mrgm Dude Khazalgar looks so damn gorgeous.
[2:46:37] bojackhorseman2004: Hes thumbnails and titles are what most people would consider clickbait
[2:46:40] bojackhorseman2004: like on the heavy side
[2:47:01] Jack_the_Dipper: @Lausten YES!!!
[2:47:57] bojackhorseman2004: well, speculation is fine when you dont write stuff like "confirmed" in the title xD

[2:48:56] LuiBMHunter: tarot cards are used to predict your future  -
[2:48:56] chelfx: Its like fortune telling
[2:49:03] SlithTheSivak: tarot is a method of diving fate or reading someones aura by drawing cards while asking pertinent questions
[2:49:06] chelfx: like reading your horoscope
[2:49:17] chelfx: its just merch they can make moeny off
[2:49:21] CrowMomocle: Tarot cards are most often used in reading someone's fortune, they tend to have great artwork.
[2:49:40] Okami_117: I think they're doing a challenge via the cards
[2:49:47] Okami_117: cool art yeah
[2:49:53] SlithTheSivak: the cards themselves are all symbols, so pertaining to wow, one of the cards is the Warrior, so it would probably show like Varian or something on it
[2:49:54] CrowMomocle: I collect Tarot cards so good for collectors
[2:49:55] chelfx: my fried who likes tarot is buying it since she loves wow and tarot
[2:50:12] CrowMomocle: no
[2:50:14] SlithTheSivak: tarot is a collection of symbols depicted on cards
[2:50:17] chelfx: Just the name of the cards
[2:50:25] mikeygames: enjoy rest of stream! thanks for helping with rune
[2:50:25] Abruhcadabro: Fortune telling cards
[2:50:27] Okami_117: kinda like Ouiji is a hasbro trademark
[2:50:48] CrowMomocle: Tarot is a pack of playing cards, used from at least the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe
[2:50:58] magicalrng: DBW trinket in sod? they made new update?
[2:51:00] CrowMomocle: but you tend not to play with them :)
[2:51:00] Lausten: Go read the 2 page wiki about Tarot cards :D
[2:51:20] magicalrng: LUL
[2:51:23] SlithTheSivak: One of the cards is The Tower, it'll likely show Kharazan, another is The Betrayer, who will likely be depicted by Illidan etc...
[2:51:27] CrowMomocle: They are taken quite seriously by many
[2:51:43] moriartiphd: That's what you get for hanging all the witches.  In the US we still have plenty of fortune tellers. It's a booming business.
[2:51:44] ImperfectDark: oh you'd see Tarot cards in shows/movies all the time. People doing fortune telling. The famous DEATH card
[2:51:50] chelfx: i would like it if they added DK moves to warriors, or monk moves for rogues
[2:51:50] Lausten: Theres even a card called Death if I recall
[2:52:03] Okami_117: can also be used as curse objects if my great aunt is to be believed
[2:52:13] chelfx: im bad at catch

[2:59:35] Lausten: "I cant tell ya directly, but yes its planned" is waht she said
[2:59:38] magicalrng: probably will be 1000g for dual talent
[2:59:42] SlithTheSivak: it used to be a scaling respec cost, 1g, then 10g, then more n more
[3:00:23] chelfx: gold sinks has it purpose

[3:02:55] Lausten: And no, they are still Blizzard employees
[3:03:52] Lausten: Blizzard is just owned by Microsoft
[3:04:16] StreamElements: EARLY LOOK at Khaz Algar Zones in The War Within (Pre-Alpha) - https://youtu.be/XbrZRxCSM50
[3:04:56] magicalrng: sod is basically ur gear to max, do a raid and lvl another character lol
[3:06:45] magicalrng: well i cant blame you for putting in all that work because sod ph1 was big hype
[3:07:32] chelfx: well we kinda know what to expect now
[3:07:32] CrowMomocle: I absolutely loved the first phase of SoD
[3:07:49] moriartiphd: Thd glyphs are not as impactful
[3:07:52] CrowMomocle: But now with house move I can't commit to it for a bit.
[3:08:00] magicalrng: yeah its a shame dual talent isnt in the game because that hinders me from pvping pve

[3:09:34] Lausten: Is it literally in Wrath?
[3:09:34] thegnomeking775: Phase 1 had a lot more crazy runes that mixed up the gameplay (Meta, Crusader Strike, Divine Storm, etc)...
[3:09:42] Lausten: Without the Dungeon Finder?
[3:09:45] magicalrng: well i wanted to do RFD and couldnt find people for 1 hour. that really demotivated me to play that day because i see what you're getting at
[3:10:16] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies 🧡 https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[3:10:27] magicalrng: yeah just an easier system to find people without having to spam the chat every 1min
[3:10:41] Lausten: An official interface over needing to download an addon is always preferred!
[3:10:57] magicalrng: my friends dont even know the LFG addon exist
[3:11:40] chelfx: So what you saying with the grup finding is "Let the Past Die, Kill It If You Have To
[3:12:02] Jack_the_Dipper: Pokemon?
[3:12:14] chelfx: YEs
[3:12:18] chelfx: they did for the prequals
[3:12:27] SlithTheSivak: i def know there are little girls who f'ing love Rey
[3:12:30] magicalrng: i rewatch them every 5 years lol
[3:12:42] chelfx: The people who grew up with the new ones will be the older fans
[3:12:51] Lausten: Gotta give the internet visuals, like screnshot the retail UI and put a big red X on top of the Dungeon and Raid finder and put green arrows towards the Premade Groups, and even then you'll still have people complain about being teleported to dungeons automatically LUL
[3:13:04] Tmicrochip: SoD had me hyped but now it feels like it's just retail skills in vanilla. I love the world changes like the PVP zones and events and all but hoping they really do different things. Like give classes differnet weapon type optiosn and such. I wanna be an Enhance with Thunderfury.

[3:13:56] SlithTheSivak: I wish we were getting this level of attention in retail for PvP
[3:14:28] Jack_the_Dipper: !song
[3:14:31] chelfx: they should have given both factions shamans and paladins
[3:14:34] Jack_the_Dipper: D:
[3:15:07] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:15:13] Lausten: @chelfx That would also have required allowed existing races to be those specs..
[3:17:45] chelfx: they did sound evil
[3:17:48] BBMezzy: That's still up in the air I think
[3:17:50] chelfx: like the new scarlet
[3:17:51] SlithTheSivak: We are friends i thought
[3:18:25] BBMezzy: They could just be a subfaction of the arathi
[3:18:25] uglukz: i got the vibe we are friends with some
[3:18:34] uglukz: but there will be radical ones
[3:18:35] SlithTheSivak: i think the whole zone turning puple regularly indicates some void influence, likely corruption
[3:18:35] chelfx: They sound like over zealot light users
[3:18:47] uglukz: like venthyr
[3:19:15] SlithTheSivak: the arathi "beacons" that turn on when the zone turns puple are supposed to be safe zones
[3:21:22] chelfx: Nothing compared about the threat above
[3:21:27] chelfx: is that impying they are threat
[3:21:35] chelfx: threat below**
[3:21:51] SlithTheSivak: threat from within, corruption
[3:22:36] uglukz: the kultiran lookin dude
[3:23:04] Lausten: They're humanoids, humanoids corrupt
[3:23:09] SlithTheSivak: already know thats gonna b my favorite zone
[3:23:18] uglukz: love the idea that those would be the leveling sets
[3:23:26] uglukz: makes sense
[3:23:42] SlithTheSivak: the purple change mechanic is gonna be fun, and hopefully it impacts Warmode significantly
[3:24:17] chelfx: i do love me some soup
[3:24:20] Lausten: Blood Moon event rings a bell?
[3:24:27] SlithTheSivak: ooo we can purge the corruption, revert it to golden time if we work together
[3:26:58] Lausten: Sure seems like you're spending tons of tie summoning it every time you die
