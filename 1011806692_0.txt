[1:11:57] Skizzurp: its funny u said diablo shit cuz the cube thing for knowledge reminds me of the D3 cube and also i think they gonna add leaderboards to Torghast corridors
[1:12:40] Voltsicle: @Towelliee is the new Ret pald lego any good?
[1:12:51] Cerbrus0: @dalaraz i know butr let's hope that all classes get 256 weapons, as much weapons tokens "were bad" at least they were for everyone at 233 ilvl
[1:13:00] kowaikoro: yes weapon token is nathria thing
[1:13:12] Skizzurp: yea no weapon token just loots and not every class has a 259 weapon lol
[1:13:34] Samurai3434: My friend and I did a M+ yesterday, and we both have everything unlocked to T1 in our Sanctum, and he got more Anima at the end. Anyone know why?
[1:13:38] dalaraz: @Cerbrus0 yeah loottables are up atm,some melees will have lower weapons as it seems
[1:13:42] Corigg: Weapon token is the lazy way of givin out weapons
[1:14:16] Voltsicle: @Towelliee Did you test the new Divine Toll Legandary? is it any good?
[1:14:22] nitairlol: weapon tokens is like just 1 additional step to get the weapon... I do not see any beneficial thing of it
[1:14:22] dalaraz: but since it happened in the past and wasnt fixed,im not expecting anything :p
[1:14:34] Cerbrus0: @dalaraz i know, most of the class that uses agi 1 handed weapons are getting fucked
[1:14:45] andreastb: in what way lol, it just gave us more options to choose from so u can get the stats u want @Corigg
[1:14:56] Alexkayzz: naa they wouldn't, you need to test the meaningful choice making too

Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || Towel will be switching to Belf Pally on prepatch || No TBC Launch date or prepatch date yet.
[1:34:41] HolyDaizy: its just that ppl know now kinda what they are doing compared to 2007. Thats why they uplifted the arenarating aswell
[1:34:41] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[1:35:08] dalaraz: arena teams and ratings are way different so it collides there.people used to switch teams etc,now you cant since you have to start back from 0
[1:35:09] PhillyDilly18: So prepared !
[1:35:22] SpoonManes: excited for RE:Village?
[1:35:23] Artivicii: yeah might be true
[1:35:24] PadidinJones: Lol it makes illidan look kinda cross eyed
[1:35:25] dalaraz: @Towelliee today is a personal rating,in bc it was arena team too
[1:35:50] Artivicii: it only took me like 3-4 weeks to get my gavel. doesnt make sense for a BIS pve and pvp item
[1:35:55] HolyDaizy: @dalaraz rip boosting :p
[1:35:56] xecksi: its that s1 and s2 gear diddnt have a rating at all. and the rating for weapons is 2050 and shoulders at 2200. this affects enh shaman way more than other classes because they made bs and kara weps mh only
[1:36:11] xecksi: they have 2 weapons to choose from in the offhand
[1:36:23] dalaraz: @HolyDaizy boosting will work just fine,imagine though getting kicked out of your team then have to regrind
[1:36:30] dartrilas: with the amount of witched on players compared to then, starting at 0 makes sense
[1:36:46] dartrilas: othwerise itd be so toxic with teams just restarting to get rating and never sticking together
[1:36:47] Artivicii: true

[1:48:37] Artivicii: if they arent changing it
[1:48:41] Blynx: guardian druids want pvp gear early though right
[1:48:42] belfastcl: i don't think free loot is the issue, you required a pretty decent rating to get all the items in an arena season, even if it had no requirements to use it
[1:48:45] Crimadus: if we got 5 key one Person more is lucky
[1:48:53] Artivicii: shoulders were 2100
[1:49:14] Wildside1177: That is going to destroy  the PvP population. But hey, some people like it.
[1:49:25] MrGatti: #neverlucky
[1:49:31] xecksi: enhancement shaman are affected more than all the other classes by the mh only bs weapon  and mh only kara weapons and now this arena change. they only have 2 offhands that are slow enough to choose from.
[1:49:35] SlayerLightStorm: @belfastcl Then again, I don't participate in pvp.
[1:49:47] wraaith: if anything it makes the pvp season a little longer
[1:49:51] Wildside1177: Now that I have to grind all that rating I will instead do something else.
[1:49:53] Artivicii: yeah bear druids use some pvp gear. they cant reach proper def rating even if they tried early in the exp
[1:50:19] dartrilas: whatst hat addon that shows rtarity of mount drop
[1:50:28] izabeL: @Towelliee what's a good amount of gold to have in BC?
[1:50:40] wraaith: @Artivicii with the gear u get in pre made boost ur def capped
[1:50:47] Tr3sko: Think a lot of PVE'ers are bit malding because of main hand restrictions on BS mace
[1:51:46] Freddy_Krueger: cant wait to watch some kara raids, even though it will be easy, it was such a nice instance
[1:51:52] Wildside1177: I am a PvEer. It would have been nice to toss out a few arenas every now and then but there is no point now. Not a bbig deal. More time for aldor/scryer farming.
[1:51:57] xecksi: if they had it at 1500 rating and people just did 10 games and lost every one of them it would take 12 weeks to get a weapon.  now only the top 5 % will be able to get a weapon or top 1% for shoulders

[2:10:11] DeanoTV: 2 weeks after 9.1 we get flying
[2:10:12] Freddy_Krueger: will you be able to fly in the maw also? Havent been up to date with shadowlands
[2:10:41] DeanoTV: nah blizz confirmed its 2 weeks
[2:10:57] Freddy_Krueger: ah alright, nice nice
[2:11:00] Chaosruler: Unfortunate, flying kind of ruined the game to begin with
[2:11:16] DeanoTV: flying doesn't ruin the game wtf LUL
[2:11:34] jerexify: @Towelliee I'm assuming in this case that each of your characters will have to do it, right? Not just one and then it's account-wide?
[2:11:58] silversoidier: Just came back to shadowlands is there a rep requirement for flying?
[2:12:02] Sincline387: @jerexify account wide

[2:12:11] DeanoTV: no rep required for flying
[2:12:18] Chaosruler: I never liked it personally, gliding sure but not a huge fan of flying.
[2:12:31] jerexify: @Sincline387 Really? Only one character has to do the questline, and then all of your alts can fly?
[2:12:32] bembeyaz_: do we need venari rep for 9.1 ?
[2:12:33] jerexify: Nice.
[2:12:35] Artivicii: bewm
[2:12:42] SlayerLightStorm: @Chaosruler What, may I ask, kinda shit are you smokin'? You are out of your gourd. Flying has done nothing but ENHANCE the gameplay experience.
[2:12:47] Sincline387: @jerexify yep only one
[2:12:56] willeh55005: do we need vanari rep in 9.1
[2:13:05] DeanoTV: its called WORLD of warcraft flying is better for exploring

[2:13:08] Freddy_Krueger: @Chaosruler I agree. I would take no flying over flying, but once its there I just go with the flow otherwise I will be the slowpoke LUL
[2:13:11] PToastman: I like doing the zones without flying at launch
[2:13:13] jontrann: thats awesome, eye of the jailer sucked ass
[2:13:15] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @ozzydaymo (warning)
[2:13:45] Scarhearth: People will complain regardless. Flying unlocked early? Omg flying is too easy to unlock you should have to work for it. Flying unlocked too late? Omg why is blizzard making us wait until near the end of the tier to let us fly
[2:13:48] Chaosruler: If you look back there was more play interaction overall before flying was introduced and wasn't a general thing.
[2:14:05] jontrann: people will sweaty nerd everything LUL
[2:14:14] Ozzyminion: hmm messages deleted by moderator....
[2:14:40] Holysal: u posted a link
[2:14:44] Scarhearth: People still bitched that it was too hard when flying was locked behind just gold lol
[2:14:44] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[2:14:45] Ozzyminion: as i was saying , icy veins still states flying will take 7 weeks to get , weird that they havent updated it

[2:21:24] Phantomstrk: for the general player, best spec to level pally in for TBC ?
[2:21:33] Holysal: afkers
[2:21:34] Samurai3434: How many people can a guild have in TBC?
[2:21:37] Ozzyminion: First half of BT was a prick , second half felt faster
[2:22:15] Ozzyminion: @Phantomstrk ret my man

[2:25:34] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Towelliee is a boomer, don't confuse him with twitch memes
[2:25:34] Ozzyminion: True for the pre patch
[2:25:50] Ozzyminion: but its possible , 2 week pre patch
[2:25:57] Wedgeh: @Wedgeh There'll definitely be good times ahead trying to find out :D
[2:26:03] Tigerklaue: i hope they dont rush it , 2 weeks pre patch is a joke
[2:26:07] NILLme: i think Towl feels like Sloot now when someone ask about June first :D
[2:26:23] Ozzyminion: absolutely not ,
[2:26:39] Ozzyminion: 2 weeks pre patch is plenty of time
[2:26:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah 2 weeks is enough if you really try
[2:27:19] RocketMan23: and you know what happens when you assume
[2:27:19] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: And I took that personally!
[2:27:23] Artivicii: no boost, no time to level BibleThump
[2:27:33] Scarhearth: People hear and think what they want to hear
[2:27:35] Wildside1177: Yes but it is definitiely reasonable to think that is what they meant.
[2:27:45] Samurai3434: What would the XP boost be from?
[2:27:57] shale93: I took 2 weeks off of work on a classic launch and I literally hit 60 on 14th day and I played like 12h a day
[2:27:59] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee  Are you factoring the exp squish of tbc pre patch though?
[2:28:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: or a mage friend thats gonna boost the reroll paladins
[2:28:09] Kinghorn: he just said -30%
[2:28:25] Dirtnose: @Samurai3434 TBC just requires less XP per level
[2:29:01] silversoidier: Did you raid TBC with djs?
[2:29:26] Ozzyminion: ahh that was the question i was going to ask what level does it kick in

[2:29:37] Senn0w: i hit 30 today on my druid for the tbc prep and shit is going slow  I hate lvling in classic man
[2:29:51] GodKingMuninn: Wouldn't it be stupid not too though?

[2:30:47] Exodeo_: I just quest and make sure i'm having fun, it's slow but effective for me
[2:30:48] NILLme: with a quest helping addon is much easier (and faster) to lvl. Its always telling you where to go and what to do
[2:30:58] Holysal: @H3adCracker theres free ones that are better
[2:31:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: i'll do it in 7 days, but im sweaty LUL
[2:31:29] Ozzyminion: Heres an interesting question then , do you think that  the early release may be intentional in order to split the player base that are leveling dranai and bloodelf ?\
[2:31:33] Kale_Nd: @Holysal who says i don't get it for free, wink wink
[2:31:38] Samurai3434: It'll be like a Mage Bukakke
[2:31:39] Bigmann109: So when do you think I need to drop my vacation time off for launch of BC
[2:31:39] NILLme: SM boosts start around 20 i think
[2:31:46] Holysal: @H3adCracker hehe
[2:31:47] SonofHorus82: mos def using the lvl boost on my shaman and getting him to 60 so I can get my belf up and going.
[2:31:49] Dirtnose: Zygor is also way ahead of everyone when it comes to an in game addon and ease of use

[2:32:08] tmenace017: Well that just means that if you’re a belf or Draenei the dark portal will be less clogged up when it’s your time to go through right?
[2:32:13] Kinghorn: towTinfoil sell more boosts towTinfoil
[2:32:24] Ozzyminion: That was my thought
[2:32:28] NILLme: that will surely save them some server stress
[2:32:36] bewm: so are we buying into june 1st?
[2:32:47] Makkek: but you can't use boost for draenei and bloodelf?
[2:32:54] Finalboss1401: i thought they said no boost for Draenei/bE
[2:33:01] NILLme: @Finalboss1401 mage boost i guess

[2:46:16] TyndiVelspaz: I'm strongly considering sinking time into leveling in Classic instead of leveling alts in retail. Is priest leveling as slow and painful as I remember?
[2:46:20] NILLme: @WhiteKnight74648 im the same, 9.1 feels like meh to me. Planning to skip it and focus fully on TBC

[2:55:58] croco_405: this video was posted by the layoff dev gang
[2:56:03] spanij: @Towelliee true man
[2:56:14] StApexart: It's not the developers fault though
[2:56:21] StApexart: They get their instructions from the top down
[2:56:23] firefly_on: lets hope for 9.1 to be good
[2:56:25] tripl3heart: They literally destroyed the game for casuals
[2:56:29] Thoreya: meh its some on the developers
[2:56:36] Thoreya: cant blame it all on the higher ups
[2:56:44] PToastman: Literally destroyed lul
[2:56:50] MrFuzzynuts420: I can’t believe I’m saying it but I miss BFA lol
[2:56:55] soth_klf: it's the Devs fault lol. the top people don't decide what's in the game
[2:57:13] fat_european0: Working hard means nothing when what they're working on isn't great Sadge
[2:57:13] isoness88: Yerp
[2:57:34] MrFuzzynuts420: Yeah it’s definitely all of the above situation
[2:57:45] DeuceDempsey: LUL
[2:57:49] Thoreya: for example
[2:57:55] Thoreya: conduit energy is not the higher ups fault
[2:57:58] JimKappa420: what the point of aoe cap under 60 and in open world
[2:57:59] Heos90: lets all just blame bobby no1 will feel bad lol
[2:58:00] king_julian_96: yeah 9.2 is looking like janaury/ feb and 9.3 if there is a 9.3 will probably be like july/august next year
[2:58:03] SnackbarTV: Let's not forget, the devs want the game to be great. Even if they make some bad choices and things don't work out, they still love WoW.
[2:58:03] Thoreya: thats just bad decision making
[2:58:06] CritcobainTV: Obviously the issue is the players. Just shut the hell up and enjoy what they give us Kappa
[2:58:17] tripl3heart: the problem is they play beerpong before they make every executive decision

[2:59:01] NILLme: i think some of the decisions are made by people that never played the game
[2:59:06] CritcobainTV: @Aaradin it's kinda bad tho
[2:59:07] firefly_on: that would be ion right ?
[2:59:12] DeuceDempsey: i just hope tbc doesnt come before retail patch
[2:59:14] soth_klf: waiting 7 months for a patch should be not acceptable for a AAA subscription game
[2:59:26] Aaradin: no one was saying it was bad when it launched just now that its so long for 9.1
[2:59:33] sammsunn: I agree
[2:59:57] manmower: i heard Bobby been doing Undercover Boss as a developer, he came up with conduit power
[3:00:05] fat_european0: So what you're saying is that I should be tweeting at John Hight

[3:31:04] Nehcrom: lol
[3:31:10] FresheFefe: LUL
[3:31:14] CritcobainTV: God damn D:
[3:31:16] SpoonManes: @nilo2442 i like your complaint buddy just wanted to let ya know
[3:31:17] Knight_Sid: FeelsBadMan game is going downhill right to Crap Lake
[3:31:17] Nehcrom: WoD was the best expansion!
[3:31:20] MistaHat: bro it is so weird but BFA is starting to feel better lol it is so weird
[3:31:26] EmbraceNext: You need to wash your mouth out with soap for saying BFA is better.
[3:31:32] Holysal: @Nehcrom Jebaited
[3:31:32] bruhSit_farmer: BFA > SL ez
[3:31:34] ice_ross: in other news irishman mad
[3:31:34] Sollice: 8.3 BfA was better
[3:31:36] cruzeal: bfa is better
[3:31:38] DeanoTV: shat the bed KEKW
[3:31:42] S1appadabass: he seems upset
[3:31:45] MistaHat: @Sollice agreed
[3:31:47] Redstarz14: The complain meta sucks since it's literally every expansion, but i feel it's justified
[3:31:50] Thoreya: "ideas are easy"
[3:31:51] Orthobullet: LOL
[3:31:53] Thoreya: lol
[3:31:56] TheCliffyShow: That was a hard "Fuck" right there.
[3:31:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: some of my favorite fights where in bfa
[3:32:02] Zurgski: I don’t understand how they made shadowlands to be such a terrible expansion
[3:32:06] SmokedHog: isn't there a part 2?
[3:32:08] SmokedHog: of the rant
[3:32:10] nilo2442: the most anoying thing is that noone is challenging this complains, they just keep going on spitting half true crap
[3:32:19] FissuresNDK: dude his dick in the salad comment is great
[3:32:21] bruhSit_farmer: shadowlands was so hype but they actually shit the bed so hard we have to buy a new one
[3:32:27] TheCliffyShow: That was a hard "Fuck" at the end.
[3:32:30] Knight_Sid: aren't we ? KEKW
[3:32:34] SmokedHog: I think the dick in the salad quote is in part 2 of the vid right?
[3:32:40] Gruffian: Wow is a paid beta is the laziest take in existence.
[3:32:44] t_a_t_s_u_r_o: it's empty.
[3:32:47] fat_european0: There were lots of bugs in the raid & dungeons
[3:32:48] Simajz: When i saw your early beta streams i tought that kyrian "crafting" shit for challenges was actually legendary crafting then I saw that soulash shit..
[3:32:57] Knight_Sid: some Early Access games are polished Kappa
[3:32:57] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: The systems are very basic
[3:33:03] Artivicii: true
[3:33:05] Thoreya: "everything that i dislike about the game means the game is not polished"
[3:33:06] Zurgski: They literally forgot to add rep rewards to the game
[3:33:12] morgan_le_fayyy: why does towliee look like he is a college kid in a dorm right now
[3:33:30] BodyshotsAllDay: super low anima gainz
[3:33:55] Holysal: @Restosaurus getting his streaming room remodeled
[3:34:05] kw3nk: Is it me, or is the screen flickering o.O?
[3:34:09] GreenveinZ: The Problem is that blizz is trying too hard to make everyone happy
[3:34:09] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:34:18] DogShep: It is flickering silly bug
[3:34:23] kw3nk: Aw man, that sucks
[3:34:25] SmokedHog: my eyes
[3:34:30] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: my game does that too, annoying
[3:34:36] Fawcheddar: its finished Kappa
[3:34:36] Oldguvner: aw my eyes
[3:34:39] Knight_Sid: people say that because Blizzard always "fix" these crappy systems in X.2 or X.3, it's always the same pattern
[3:34:40] forcegamerrr: Why don't you switch to dx11?
[3:34:41] lumaday: Lack of loot drops really crushed the vibe of my raid team prog throughout Cn
[3:34:41] Clawanorder: Why not switch to DX11?
[3:34:43] Sollice: Ardenweald is bad for me

[3:34:48] FerociouzMonk: It’s a feature Kappa
[3:34:49] Simajz: Kyrian pvp arena is hardfucked with these flickers
[3:34:50] its_Steevee: ardenweald its everwhere
[3:34:50] c3ck0o: same with ardenweald
[3:34:51] Chiraakitteh: High quality Microsoft systems!
[3:35:07] MistaHat: I feel like if they would, per say, change conduit energy when people overwhelmingly dont like it, not in 9.3, people would have a better perception of the dev team
[3:35:07] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:35:19] Fawcheddar: screen flickering going as planned Kappa Kappa
[3:35:23] Simajz: Nvidia problem try to switch it back to Directx11 @Towelliee
[3:35:32] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: the x.3 is always the best form of the game
[3:35:40] Yagr6: they desperately need to revamp our talent system... it has been the same for a very long time!
[3:35:45] itsyoboywill: I love how Bell referred Torgast at choro-gast
[3:35:47] manmower: f that, i aint paying them to do coding, that's their job
[3:35:53] kw3nk: I miss MoP FeelsBadMan
[3:35:56] Drekorve: The perfect expansion is when those two visions align
[3:35:58] CallMeWallie: Towelliee I hope you get your renovations done soon, maybe it’s the pandemic but I feel like you’ve been out of your home for like a month now
[3:36:10] Sollice: Most of ALL software product laucnhes go through the SAME exact cycle. Phase 1 is pushing out the product and getting it in to the hands of the end users. Phase 2 of a product cycle is learning from success and failure and pushing out features that maybe we couldn't get in phase 1 or more polished items that we have given more feedback on
[3:36:12] Knight_Sid: 9.2 no more covenant restrictions Kappa
[3:36:18] 2naDlisch: To a point, we still had that rotating corruption vendor bullshit throughout the end of bfa
[3:36:42] Gorestack: yea and in 9.2 they'll remove conduit energy and in 9.3 make free covenant swap  LUL
[3:36:51] Sollice: @2naDlisch That was a bad Blizzard decision for sure. They should have put them all out there and let us go ham
[3:36:58] RocketMan23: 99% of people dont even notice conduit energy
[3:37:03] s7wede: Why is Blizzard so scared of talent trees. All you have to do is see how popular POE is and that shitshow of a talent tree. All they need to do is give us QOL upgrades to skills every expansion and people will feel like they have control over the customization of their characters.
[3:37:04] lumaday: Sucks for warlock
[3:37:04] TheCliffyShow: Doesn't bug me, but I hardly ever change conduits.
[3:37:06] CallMeWallie: Is conduit energy pretty much Azerite?
[3:37:20] theDirtyon3: yo towel your screen is blinking. anyone else see this?
[3:37:29] Thoreya: i just dont like how they give us 10 systems every expansion but then limit us on how we can use those systems
[3:37:34] Zettabyte: Good morning towHi
[3:37:34] Thoreya: makes it completely counter productive
[3:37:34] Sollice: @s7wede Balancing. They have a hard enough time with what they have now. Adding more options would be difficult for them to manage balance
[3:37:51] Scarhearth: as someone that swaps between brewmaster and windwalker. conduit energy kinda sucks

[3:38:23] king_julian_96: i don't think the will remove conduit energy so i don't gt why people keep asking it's not gonna happen
[3:38:38] s7wede: @s7wede Maybe Blizzard should stop trying to balance things unless it creates a disparity in PVP
[3:39:03] Sollice: Nvidia Inspector fix for flickering https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/hpclhu/nvidiaflickering_fix_for_directx_12/
[3:39:14] brutalif: If 99% don't care bout it what's the problem with it
[3:39:24] FresheFefe: Ian:"yeah yeah fuck the balance"
[3:39:27] SmokedHog: the most annoying thing is all the systems that add a time gate. only reason for that conduit energy is time gate for subs, don't think they really care about people abusing it. they want your sub
[3:39:27] brutalif: the 1% can live with it
[3:39:36] S1appadabass: WoW hasnt been balanced since its inception
[3:39:37] Vyntage1: @king_julian_96 agreed - it's small potatoes compared to other items. Yet, the community loves to get stuck in a rut
[3:39:47] RocketMan23: its impossible to truely balance the game, there are just way to many things going on, they can only do as much as possible in a given time limit
[3:39:54] Scarhearth: I'll be glad if mikanos becomes the best soulbind for brewmaster so that i dont have to keep worrying about swapping conduits when i swap specs
[3:40:05] Sollice: Thats correct
[3:40:15] Simajz: Try to switch wow settings to DX11
[3:40:15] soth_klf: I play Ret most of the time but getting KSM was such a pain in the ass, so i switched to Holy and I switch back and forth with with conduits

[3:40:18] RocketMan23: given infinite time and testing mayyyyybe they could actually balance everything, but thats not realistic
[3:40:24] Sollice: We have to update after each driver release....You know every knew driver release where they DONT fix it lol
[3:40:28] Holysal: @brutalif well im not the 1% i like playing different specs. why should I be punished for that?
[3:40:29] CADZtv: @brutalif thats not even true majority of the players love min maxing even if they arent limit or echo level
[3:40:32] Artivicii: that DH got gang banged LUL
[3:40:32] Reznr: DX11 fixed it for me
[3:40:56] CallMeWallie: Is PvP still whoever has a pet basically wins?
[3:40:58] king_julian_96: holysal that's your problem
[3:41:08] Thoreya: @olliecaulliwallie no lol
[3:41:09] Holysal: @king_julian_96 ok bud LUL
[3:41:15] Sollice: The Soul Conduit energy thing is dumb. Even if it affects the 1%. It's a dumb system that can be removed and it will be 100% people happy
[3:41:29] Sollice: Make sure your importing retail not the classic one
[3:41:32] king_julian_96: if it's that bad  don't play multiple specs simple
[3:41:50] Scarhearth: @olliecaulliwallie pets used to make people win pvp? Guess I played a hunter and warlock wrong all this time

[3:41:59] Sollice: @king_julian_96 That is NOT an acceptable solution.
[3:41:59] NILLme: its listed in Nvidia's known issues from like 6 months :D
[3:42:20] theDirtyon3: LUL
[3:42:23] Sollice: Nvidia Inspector fix for flickering https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/hpclhu/nvidiaflickering_fix_for_directx_12/
[3:42:28] kokochris: Flickering usually comes back once you switch zones
[3:42:32] Hastif: ty
[3:42:32] Knight_Sid: they just can't
[3:42:34] Sollice: It use to work. Towelliee is trying it now
[3:43:31] cbiskit89: for blizzard to balance the game they would have to remove specs and classes. there are too many choices for filling a raid. doing this to appease the players who seek meta is not worth pissing off the casual player base
[3:43:35] Voxxzz: Boosting on every aspect of the game is also a problem that's got bigger in SL
[3:43:43] Wildside1177: But they are not shit. The world does not revolve around the 1%.
[3:43:53] brutalif: who cares bout the 1%
[3:44:16] brutalif: sick of hearing bout how hard it is for the 1%
[3:44:20] PToastman: The 1% streams and can influence thr 99
[3:44:20] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:44:21] Voxxzz: What power did we have in WoD? We had none
[3:44:24] sloppy_rogue: yo guy
[3:44:33] MistaHat: If i may, i think you all miss the point of the 1%, THDlock is the 1% and that dude collects everything like a casual
[3:44:33] sloppy_rogue: guys*
[3:44:41] Gorestack: the problem is they keep injecting external variables with shitty systems making the balance even wrose
[3:44:42] smashwow: we had the power of the babe
[3:44:44] Chiraakitteh: We had the power of endless orc bosses
[3:44:47] Gruffian: @Wildside1177 In wow it does because everyone just copies the 1%
[3:44:48] king_julian_96: are vox yuor wrong we did have soem te legendary ring in wod
[3:44:55] king_julian_96: that was bowerred power
[3:45:04] Heos90: well borrowed powers by the time they start to balance them they about to be scrapped for the new borrowed powers in the next xpac
[3:45:21] MistaHat: The 1%  isnt always right but they do make a lot of sense if you listen and take the time to understand their side
[3:45:23] s7wede: @Voxxzz WOD we had the zone powers. Attacking while mounted in Nagrand etc
[3:45:26] LeonardLongNips: The problem is they keep injecting shit into the game but then come out and say "Yeah we can balance it, for sure!" As they add in 15 more layers of unbalanced stuff.
[3:45:30] Templexx: yea the old days talk is getting exhausting to listen to
[3:45:33] Exodeo_: hey i'm enjoying bear atm lol
[3:45:40] MistaHat: @LeonardLongNips honestly, not a bad take
[3:45:55] CADZtv: people have always wanted to min max in mmo's
[3:46:03] king_julian_96: even in wod we had bowerred power
[3:46:09] CADZtv: the information is just easier to get now
[3:46:17] king_julian_96: in the legendary ring so this is'nt anything new
[3:46:22] Wildside1177: The wow community is funny. There is maybe a 5% difference in the tanks - the ones that are 5% less are shit...utter nonsense. There is no fix for stupid I guess.
[3:46:22] NILLme: the worst part is that blizz are too slow with making small frequent balance updates
[3:46:51] TheCliffyShow: I don't mind borrowed power. Keeps each expansion more interesting and fresh.
[3:46:57] TechieTaco: YUP
[3:46:59] Gorestack: that's because the game is almost completely designed around competitive content. raids for world first, dungeons for mdi, pvp for arena tours.
[3:47:00] Fawcheddar: This guy in my classic guild was freaking out about not being able to level optimally. Im like my man - just chill.
[3:47:02] Mallaes: It's complicated
[3:47:13] Gurtington_: I'm the one percent tryna be like the 99% 😎
[3:47:19] LeonardLongNips: I mean the M+ tourney had like 10k viewers lol
[3:47:33] LeonardLongNips: MSI was kind of a joke
[3:47:36] king_julian_96: leaky wtf how do you  3k dps at ilvl 220
[3:47:38] HolyDaizy: GOD BLESS YOU
[3:47:42] HolyDaizy: OH NVM
[3:47:46] j_bar111: Mr. Streamer What is the best dps
[3:47:48] king_julian_96: that does'nt seem feasable
[3:47:50] s7wede: I don't care about balance. I just want to be able to tank on my DK and not feel like I'm giving the poor healer a heart attack every single pull
[3:47:53] FissuresNDK: even though i hadn't raided seriously since ICC i still went for the meta to give myself the advantage i needed. alot of people go for the meta
[3:47:53] S1appadabass: not a demo lock
[3:47:56] TechieTaco: I never thought about it like that, but you're 1000% right. I used to look up to Switfty like that.
[3:48:06] NILLme: even back in tbc i was watching pvp videos and i wanted to be like them, was copying their speccs and strats..
[3:48:10] CADZtv: exactly
[3:48:16] DrakhanGaming: being op is fun
[3:48:18] Heos90: topping a meter is fun lol
[3:48:35] xrandomdoodx: Most of the people who still play this game after 14 years  will care about min-maxxing, people who don't care prob moved on to other games at this point
[3:48:39] RocketMan23: so what you are saying is.....blame twitch Kappa
[3:48:43] SilkeySmooth: thank mythic plus
[3:48:46] FissuresNDK: fun is killing the boss
[3:48:47] GreenveinZ: SO TRUE
[3:48:48] king_julian_96: yeah if you don't do good dps
[3:48:49] xrandomdoodx: wow casual content isn't enough to keep people engaged anymore lol
[3:48:53] king_julian_96: you gt kicked
[3:48:55] Clorichu: a lot of poeple also don't get invited to groups if they aren't min maxed
[3:49:02] Mallaes: What's the best isn't always the right question
[3:49:02] Shallo1988: tbh i blame twitch for it
[3:49:06] brutalif: is that a blizz problem or player problem
[3:49:07] Oriqqs: Ya, it went away from just slaying dragons to watching meters
[3:49:14] S1appadabass: @Towelliee thanks a lot, streamer
[3:49:14] Templexx: my man spitting facts today. whens the album drop?
[3:49:24] sphynx_rayne: But that everything in the world. Everything changed the way people look at things.
[3:49:27] Artivicii: LUL
[3:49:29] king_julian_96: or if not get kicked people won't inv you if you don't do enough dps
[3:49:29] FluffehZ: rooOWO
[3:49:31] FresheFefe: i play sv hunter for fun, best specc in the game
[3:49:32] Cilir: Morn'n towelliee, did you see preach and bellular's vids about 9.1 and how disappointed they feel about it
[3:49:37] Liamhys2017: What tank do you think suffers more than the others? personnaly I think bears feel lacking in terms of CD's, especially compared to like warriors
[3:49:41] Schlong_John_Silva: Schlong_John_Silva subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 62 months! 
[3:49:43] grimblymcgoo: I dont know why people say that it was different in classic. Sure we didnt have streamers but everyone i know/knew checked thottbot/alakazam daily

[3:49:48] Scarhearth: sad but true nowadays fun is so subjective
[3:49:58] Angerina: You gotta cut back on playing a fun class so you don't get shot on in groups and raids, which is even less fun.
[3:49:58] Sollice: @beedio Just got some new buffs on 9.1 PTR but the wowhead class writer for Surv doesn't think its near enough of a buff yet
[3:49:58] TechieTaco: Thank you for coming to Towelliee's TED talk
[3:50:06] Mecabeast: happy cinco de mayo
[3:50:14] Yagr6: @Towelliee i play enhance shaman for 7 years now , i have straight orange parses and I dont care that i could play a better spec ! i enjoy enhance!
[3:50:14] king_julian_96: what's a paid beta then towelliee
[3:50:22] Gurtington_: I play a bear tank every now and then. and I hate it compared to my Warr or pally. even though I main a resto druid. the bear just seems so squishy becuase I lack as many big defensive cds
[3:50:24] maccaruso: TBC pre-patch will be June 1st.  Calling it now.
[3:50:31] Scarhearth: I dont like bellular imo
[3:50:31] mulletrocker11358: my only shadowlands launch problem was the damn login boss
[3:50:35] MistaHat: I think barebones is a better term. i think youre right after listening Towelliee
[3:50:40] Sollice: "cough" AoC $500
[3:50:40] Unciatim: Does Bell even play the game anymore really>?
[3:50:41] Heos90: well it depends on each persons definition for polished
[3:50:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: could be worse, Ashes has a paid Alpha coming up Kappa
[3:50:43] Knight_Sid: some early access games are quite polished Kappa
[3:50:57] SonofHorus82: Good thing no one does that kind of thing right Ashes of Creation!
[3:51:01] Toradin: unfinished same shit
[3:51:02] Sollice: It's just boring. Boring doesn't mean broke
[3:51:10] CADZtv: wait AOC charging 500 dollars???? KEKW
[3:51:10] Aldria_: Dont forget player knowledge increasing over the years aswell, but I agree with you regarding  influence on the casual playerbase
[3:51:10] s7wede: @Towelliee He' talking about the balance of the covenant powers and abilites in reference to a paid beta. They keep promising balance
[3:51:18] smashwow: the experience if awful though
[3:51:27] HAMMERRAZOR: hey @Towelliee hey chat how are we all
[3:51:27] Sollice: @CadzFPS Yes. You have to pay $500 to get in to the next closed alpha I believe
[3:51:34] raptorstrick: This is the first expansion in a pandemic
[3:51:34] Knight_Sid: people say it's alpha/beta because the systems are terribly thought out and as usual blizz change things in X.2 / X.3
[3:51:36] NinjaGlovz: If you like it then play it, If you don't like it then don't play it. Simple
[3:51:36] wreckedgum: its a well polished turd
[3:51:37] manmower: need some rewards in that damn thing
[3:51:41] wreckedgum: but is still a turd
[3:51:46] CADZtv: fuck that KEKW
[3:51:48] PhoenixAuTv: I mean dungeons were broken since realease for weeks
[3:51:52] Redpandalol: Feels like a semantics argument
[3:51:57] LeonardLongNips: I mean isnt part of a beta to see if a system is fun/enjoyable? I think a beta isn't solely for polish it's also for implementation.
[3:51:59] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Polished Turd
[3:51:59] Sollice: @wreckedgum That would be an accurate assessment :)
[3:52:00] ixianprince: they did a good job at what they wanted to do
[3:52:09] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee I think they just mean that a system never launches fully fleshed out. They always make bad decisions they end up spending the rest of the expansion fixing, then repackaging that as new content.
[3:52:12] Peluson11: imagine if it was unpolished...
[3:52:16] PhoenixAuTv: Not in a hard easy way, as in the dungeons's were buggy and glitching alot
[3:52:20] kowaikoro: 4 dailies and scoreghast POGGERS
[3:52:20] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Look at Mr GM's tweet, Torghast drops cosmetics in 9.1 now LOL
[3:52:23] NotEnoughMana: spice it up ion Kreygasm
[3:52:29] Schlong_John_Silva: I'm still happy with Shadowlands as a whole. Sure there's things they can work on but people now a days want the perfect content
[3:52:29] wreckedgum: hopefully they give it mage tower level rewards
[3:52:32] Cilir: I don't why they want to add affixes to it wouldn't that just turn players off from it
[3:52:34] Clawanorder: It is working as the developers intended to be.
[3:52:34] Absogames: Absogames subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 107 months, currently on a 107 month streak! almost 9 years
[3:52:38] NILLme: by 9.3 it will be actually fun and then they will scrap the idea in the next expansion :D
[3:52:40] Sollice: @xrandomdoodx Welcome to the world of software development.
[3:52:43] Nystrianzia: Isnt the dino walking right in front of him? Or I see it wrong? xD
[3:52:45] kokochris: yup Mount and Transmog would be nice
[3:52:46] JokaThS: at least we got the shoulders
[3:52:47] manmower: better than islands, but less fun because islands had loot
[3:52:47] mavericks312: it's looking like torghast will have tmogs at the least
[3:52:48] niebvelungen: ti does
[3:52:51] niebvelungen: it does
[3:52:52] LoJackATK: this all sounds like a disagreement in semantics with words used.
[3:52:59] grimblymcgoo: that was a wowhead post
[3:53:01] niebvelungen: https://www.wowhead.com/news/torghast-gets-cosmetic-shoulder-rewards-in-patch-9-1-322179
[3:53:02] J_HUG: think hes talking more about it feeling incomplete, and they have to use the exp cycle to fix it. like nothing being in the maw, torghast being light on features etc.
[3:53:03] niebvelungen: regular
[3:53:04] Sollice: I think they said shoulders and cloaks were in now?
[3:53:05] Unciatim: Reg
[3:53:10] king_julian_96: how about add some ilvl  236 gear drop
[3:53:11] DogShep: Regular since soul ash
[3:53:13] kowaikoro: floor 5 would imply regular
[3:53:20] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Random layer 9, look at the comments
[3:53:23] fistofnature: Clap
[3:53:28] Schlong_John_Silva: @king_julian_96 lmao
[3:53:28] fistofnature: expansion saved boys
[3:53:28] Mecabeast: people dont do things just to do things anymore
[3:53:30] Speedmetal: in the comment..it's layer 9
[3:53:36] Steppie: Oh look it’s me on the right
[3:53:36] Sollice: They are not going to add gear other than transmog to Torghast. Don't die on that horse
[3:53:38] dankmeliodas: wowhead shows the cosmetic models
[3:53:38] Liamhys2017: @kowaikoro There is still a floor 5 in twisting lol
[3:53:38] manmower: they should just add all the rare mounts from past xpacs in there
[3:53:40] kokochris: lol
[3:53:41] Mr_Pennywise_: lol
[3:53:43] pixxelina: LuL
[3:53:44] JiberishUI: hahahah
[3:53:48] JiberishUI: that's the best I've ever seen

[3:53:49] fistofnature: LUL saved Clap
[3:53:51] Templexx: GOT EMM
[3:53:52] CADZtv: WTF DELETE THAT TOW KEKW
[3:54:00] kowaikoro: @Liamhys2017 yeah but is there an boss at floor 5? thought it was 6 > 12 > 18
[3:54:11] TechieTaco: YUP
[3:54:12] manmower: make it drop anima
[3:54:13] Toradin: and good bosses
[3:54:14] kokochris: for sure agree
[3:54:16] Schlong_John_Silva: @manmower but then the people that farmed those mounts for years will complain
[3:54:16] hectabit: god this m+ week sucks
[3:54:18] LeonardLongNips: its only shoulders though
[3:54:22] DrakhanGaming: so thats what you would look like bald, not bad tbh
[3:54:22] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:54:23] Gorestack: those covenant armor recolors should've been in Torghast
[3:54:27] Liamhys2017: There isn't a boss on 5 in twisting either, not sure whats goin on there
[3:54:30] Liamhys2017: @kowaikoro
[3:54:31] etter00: mount or something
[3:54:35] tommy_thick: @Towelliee Any opinion on Tom Wilson from the Capitals Rangers game? The NHL 5k fine was a joke.
[3:54:44] SilkeySmooth: maybe by the next prepatch blizzard will get torghast right🤣🤣🤣
[3:54:46] kimmo_gaming: Tmogs, mounts, toys maybe, something that will make people farm that shit
[3:54:46] piratechris: Why not a currency that you could use to buy transmogs.. like older transmogs?
[3:55:06] fistofnature: thats the trial of style

[3:55:08] CADZtv: yessssssssssssssss
[3:55:10] Wcvechten: There's so many unused colours for old gearsets and weapons even now, they really could add it into twisting corridors or something
[3:55:14] dankmeliodas: The race weapons you see on npc's too
[3:55:14] stallowned: yes
[3:55:22] MrKhanes: yes please!
[3:55:23] Sollice: Torghast is a perfect vehicle to add all of that kind of stuff
[3:55:25] s7wede: Torghast just needs to drop full transmog pieces and then currency that you can spend to eventually purchase the missing pieces.
[3:55:35] Toradin: its hard for indie company))
[3:55:41] Sollice: Blizzard, and hopefully they are now, just need to commit to it
[3:55:50] LeonardLongNips: Its only shoulder pieces
[3:55:52] LeonardLongNips: no other slot

[3:56:35] Steppie: Layer 9 he said to me
[3:56:54] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Fuck it, rather do Torghast

[4:09:57] LeonardLongNips: torghast is just a mandatory snoozefest
[4:10:07] sahhe: hey what is your nameplate addon
[4:10:12] jerexify: So, the more things you kill in a row, the higher your score stays, I'm assuming? Slight tank advantage to Torghast still, then?

[4:20:00] Liamhys2017: What tank do you think suffers more than the others? personaly I think bears feel lacking in terms of CD's, especially compared to like warriors

[6:07:11] Sniped23: Bc I’m assuming blizzard is trying to space out tbc classic from 9.1 correct? @towelliee
[6:07:56] mozavich: @Sniped23 they stated they weren't going to delay tbc or 9.1 regardless though.
[6:08:05] Sniped23: 9.1 first?
[6:08:10] ProjectSevan: I just want TBC prepatch so I can start leveling my Blood Elf
[6:08:13] soysos91: plz 9.1 first haha
[6:08:42] Mahca_: id like to see prepatch soon too
[6:08:52] soysos91: I'm hoping it's a good sign they're testing a bunch of bosses this week

[6:09:55] rsimpson105: 2-3 weeks for prepatch right?
[6:10:07] Sniped23: Ok asmon was saying he thinks tbc is in august.. nice to hear you say sooner I want it in like June hooefully
[6:10:14] Mahca_: yeah i cant see them overlapping
[6:11:03] kr95tho: we need to give all the dads time to get tier 3 on their shaman/pally
[6:11:06] mavericks312: how does a June 1st tbc date get leaked and ppl still think 9.1 is coming first
[6:11:11] A_New_Challenger: Haven't we always thought their roadmap looks like it points towards BC release softening the blow of the extended time it is going to take for 9.1?
[6:11:29] PokerFaceMoose: legally have to do it
[6:11:33] RoboMaximillion: that sounds awesome
[6:11:56] PokerFaceMoose: 1 time use but you can buy multiple i think
[6:11:56] Moobot: Be on Discord. I will announce the giveaways as I play some Classic. Be active and be IN Twitch chat at time of winning.
[6:13:18] mozavich: "...So, while we want to avoid too much collision between the two, we also understand that there are many players who only play Classic, and there are many players who only play Shadowlands, and we don't want to punish one group in order to avoid a conflict for the other, while still trying to make sure that each game has some time and space to breathe on its own." -Ion Hazzikostas

[6:15:10] LeonardLongNips: supposedly a 1pm est announcement happening
[6:15:13] Sniped23: For awhile I thought they’d hold on to bc or 9.1 to release at the same time as either ESO expansion or new world.. they always like to release stuff to combat competition
[6:15:21] pereadin: Looked like shadow bolts
[6:16:00] briefbreadfruit: youve been told theres something happening today? fucking hype

[6:16:35] ProjectSevan: I wonder if it changes based on your class, since you're paladin it's like the opposite of you

[6:55:55] Mitchendo64: im starting to get sus
[6:55:55] fooboo2: Pandaria was mine. I think it still holds up for leveling and the experience as well. Wish that I could have the same feelings for any of the new expansions, but I can’t get the same satisfaction that I did back in the day when playing pandaria. Too bad Garrosh blew up the vale, such a pretty zone...
[6:55:57] volkreig: What zone?
[6:56:00] Jattell: hell no, vashjir is beautiful with a great questline
