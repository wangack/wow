[1:14:28] abogdanov93: some days ago you were on rap music :D
[1:14:42] likemybubble1: shinta is crazy good player the people he played with he always told them every gcd to press
[1:15:01] shucoco: Its so hard to understand why tho. Gcd's should be sort of scripted as warr?
[1:15:34] shucoco: Never understood why some warr do double damage
[1:15:59] likemybubble1: tracking revenge proc is insane dmg diff by itself
[1:16:16] likemybubble1: which most prob dont
[1:16:27] notmorbos: but thats so basic isnt it
[1:16:31] Cahirs: Is it easier to find ppl to play with in PvP on classic than on retail?
[1:16:49] shucoco: I think one of the biggest difference is how selective best warriors are with charge / cept usage
[1:16:51] braphlol: its all about clean globals, that being said im dogshit at it myself

[1:18:03] notmorbos: from my experience it sucks on both
[1:18:18] notmorbos: there is some solid discords for finding mates in classic, just the ingame options are miserable like pojke said
[1:18:49] notmorbos: but its never easy to just find a longterm teammate
[1:19:20] godreazy: i found 10x more 2s partners in the ingame tool than in dragonflight s1, the new xross realm lfg is fine

[1:26:08] hattenhaus: they stick with sub (easy spec)
[1:26:12] HeyImArty: @hvckfy dont you literally have your warmane achievements/Rankings listed on your twitch page
[1:26:16] waffle977: i think counter gearing counts even if its 1 game. you should not switch gear because you can see on stream what ur facing
[1:26:18] HeyImArty: bro giving off clown vibes
[1:26:21] Xeriyo: @hvckfy my bro you literally have a stream on your youtube 2 years ago that says "warmane solo q"
[1:26:23] rebarmuskel: I just asked every warmane player they all said hvckfy played warmane
[1:26:28] Xeriyo: what is that meme you are generating
[1:26:36] hvckfy: @Xeriyo so i was playing wmane 2 years ago? or it was 10 years?
[1:26:43] Xeriyo: did i type 2 or 10
[1:26:45] shucoco: @godreazy only reason why assa disc could win vs warpal is cause of burns and offensive dispel man
[1:26:47] Unfeatured: Point is Hv you said NEVER
[1:26:49] HeyImArty: You said you never played it

[1:31:07] zelraftw: the aim of the game is to win so if the game allows u to choose different gear why wouldnt you?
[1:31:23] breakyax: aim of game is collect mmr and stand in dalaran
[1:31:23] kkush2: games dead because of the SOD garbage
[1:31:28] Unfeatured: Bro wants to lock in gear and talents and never have the game change. That's why he played warmane.
[1:31:28] Evilhoney: how dare you improve ur chanse to win
[1:31:30] braphlol: heckfy u been playing spr all inning people first 30s for 4 seasons straight can u just shut up please ur playing pvp like its a fucking pve encounter
[1:31:31] hvckfy: @zelraftw the aim of life is having nice life so go kill everyone and still everything lol
[1:31:39] cepsegnever: @hvckfy i mean if u getting hard counter by something, and swapping gear u can manage to win it, why wouldn't you? specially when they play at top ladder mmr and u can guess who u facing, this is why SPR win warpals at low rating (if the spr doesn't shit their pants tho)
[1:31:40] chinchin23: double healers are all the way to WoD right?
[1:31:42] Zero_Kelvin: @zelraftw when you enter arena, you don't know who you're facing, that is the idea. In later expansion you could see the comp and adapt, but it's not classic idea

[2:03:31] Caej: all ur arguments its
[2:03:36] Caej: he was banned, so he is cheater.
[2:03:58] demongodxtv: course he did they all did and not just imorph just go look at the endless posts of people on private servers crying from years ago and then all of a sudden its the same shit now? theres no smoke without fire in my eyes but sure imorph
[2:03:59] notmorbos: well he got banned in a 9k people banwave for cheating
[2:04:03] mike_aqu: TORSTEN AND CHOCO ARE WRATH SCUM

[2:05:23] joshmcdonaldsx: @demongodxtv been using imorph since 2019
[2:05:29] Caej: @notmorbos ye, and banned time was removed from perma to 6 month cuz we dont care about ur situation and cba understand something
[2:06:00] notmorbos: tbh if i was a dev and someone gets caught in an automated cheating banwave
[2:06:04] notmorbos: im not sure i would do much

[2:07:26] Fiftyswen: @Caej he is back to perma qwener said in one of his streams
[2:08:08] demongodxtv: clearly xD
[2:08:09] AnnxxR: same with ahk, its unlikely u will get banned for using it
[2:08:18] notmorbos: like i dont like making stupid conclusions based on some twitch clips or whatever, but if theres a permaban issued explicitly for cheating we kinda have to trust that no

[2:09:22] Caej: choko is bug abusers, sniper and more more more
[2:09:23] demongodxtv: not just one permaban hes been banned multiple times at different intervals but sure lets all ignore the elephant in the room

[2:09:33] JustTryingToOwn: bro this opposing warrior got so many tauren procs lmao!

[2:10:23] notmorbos: @Caej i mean thats what i said, i really dont care about any single clip. weird textures, gouge turns, it could all be legit
[2:10:30] demongodxtv: you work at blizz caej?
[2:11:00] Caej: @demongodxtv stupid provocation
[2:11:09] notmorbos: like blizz has stuff on our pcs to check program were running simultaneously with wow

[2:12:18] AnnxxR: u can combine it with weakaura and do automated actions like bop on blind if trinket on warrior is missing
[2:12:25] breakyax: only problem with AHK is that they ban for it
[2:12:27] AnnxxR: 0.0000001 ms into the blind
[2:12:30] Caej: @AnnxxR ur eye have color recognition. can u please delete ur eyes?

[3:13:44] RuptureKD: @cepsegnever But hey, it's not oonly about arenas, people at the end of Vanilla classic was flaming on vanilla, TBC Hype, then they quit TBC after one month WOTLK Hype, then...
[3:13:57] cepsegnever: tbc was legit 5 classes viable, scuffed wotlk version of the game, wotlk is the upgrade of tbc, the same tbc was for vanilla, but u can argue vanilla is good bcos of importance of the world and wbuffs and alot of things, MMO things they game removed with expansions

[3:16:12] cepsegnever: wotlk and mop by far best expansions, objetively, from any class POV, not ur personal opinion like most ppl give, every expansion has their things tho i rly like most of first expansions till mop end, i played till shadowlands s2 tho was fun till then still playable
