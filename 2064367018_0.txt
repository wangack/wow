[3:20:53] Webchika: @RespectedBandito Don't stress it if people die at first =) A lot of DPS atm seem to think healers will save them no matter what they stand in, and when you're learning they'll die but it more than likely won't be your fault

[4:54:28] Vexoroni: Do you ever run tree form instead of convoke?
[4:54:43] theBroHam: @Vexoroni he does in certain dungeons, just depends
[4:54:50] Vexoroni: Oh cool ok
[4:54:57] frazlord: High Fall and Rise are good tree dungeons
[4:56:30] dragona92: JB, why Edge and not a new window of Firefox Susge
[4:57:02] Whitewolf1441: addons?
[4:57:07] dragona92: That's odd
[4:57:08] FlustTV: i feel like with the power creep this season the mdi should be running 24-26 instead of 22-24
[4:57:27] FlustTV: watching echo blow through 22 brh is of course impressive but it feels less so because its just not very dangerous
[4:57:28] Felilyy: would u ever play master shapeshifter in high keys?
[4:57:30] cheesey_oce: no spring blossoms interesting
[4:57:54] faleley: if they did that, tyra would be boring af @flusttv
[4:58:03] macildevil: i would love to play master shapeshifter, but it feels off on higher keys that really require you to heal a lot
[4:58:20] faleley: @cheesey_oce dont need for these keys
[4:58:59] FlustTV: @faleley i mean the first boss trash barely even got to them before the boss died
[4:59:03] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[4:59:08] Felilyy: @macildevil +1

[5:06:54] SinstoneRelics: we thought we ran too close to the stairs
[5:07:15] bebincalicious: If the Saurid doesn't get downstairs, it resets the boss. Happened on multiple first boss pulls
[5:07:32] ole94_: check them pc
[5:07:38] Whitewolf1441: !!!! WHAT WAS THAT GATE
[5:08:18] flawlesslykun: YEP
[5:08:29] theBroHam: I saw that in BRH too
[5:08:55] theBroHam: tattles on people when they die
[5:10:36] KineasRM: @jdotb do you think there is a enherited "nerf" to melees while playing higher keys or time attacks like MDI? ex: on PoE, melees are vastly nerfed due the insta kill nature of the game
[5:10:37] Whitewolf1441: How does echo just do so much damage
[5:11:23] ole94_: LULW

[5:20:25] eainzsp: i got cooked in max's chat for saying who cares about dps meters as long as the mobs die lmao
[5:21:20] tryhard_scrub: you still do the MDI jb?
[5:21:23] davidart2: what happened to nerf and his m+ team haven't seen them for a while
[5:21:52] Guffels: !mdi
[5:22:03] Funkytree: @theBroHam i think english misses the sounds needed for this word, the "Ł" does sound like "w", the 'ó' is just a 'u' but you'd say it more like 'ou', but the 'dź' is the fucked one
[5:22:53] scheriel: echo is going down today
[5:23:06] Nymzeee: @scheriel They don't play again today

[5:32:45] theBroHam: they are quiet
[5:33:01] kelly_mac06: i can hear them fine but like growl sounds louder than max
[5:33:29] Sombregard: How about a prot pal as a "healer"
[5:33:45] Bobugs: that evoker is doing 0 damage!
[5:33:54] Sombregard: You bring 2 tanks ( prot pal included) and 3 dps
[5:33:57] Geekop_: Evoker paid for a boost in mdi ?
[5:34:01] theBroHam: I can get up to like 50k hps playing ret if necessary. Could be alternative
[5:34:17] Funkytree: bruh why bring 2 tanks if you can just have prot pala tank and heal with 4 dps
[5:34:18] Guffels: im just using maxs audio lol
[5:34:24] KembriaTV: HPS =/= proper effective healing
[5:34:43] haelthyr: you cant port in and out in mdi?
[5:34:51] Sombregard: @Funkytree In the kinda pull they do in MDI, prot pal tanking and healing would flop
[5:34:52] scheriel: is that sodapoppin on priest? pog
[5:36:34] scheriel: wdym they have no healer monkaHmm sanguine topping the healer meters
[5:36:59] Funkytree: @Sombregard maybe, but if they're doing these pulls without any healer i think it could work, maybe not in all dungeons tho
[5:37:04] Guffels: yeah who is this sanguine person. echo should recruit hi,
[5:37:06] Guffels: him*
[5:37:06] Celissah: wtf they are 4 dps they will bring it down so quick anyways.
[5:37:13] lanio91: hy jb
[5:37:15] Celissah: Dont care if it's solo witherbark.
[5:37:22] supzfly: with sang you kinda don't wanna pull mobs on the boss tbh
[5:37:33] KembriaTV: Everyone watching MDI just to find out who will come in second place KEKW
[5:37:38] knick_knack99: 6% in front of last boss
[5:38:00] Sombregard: @Funkytree I doubt it, you would need every Holy Power to keep SotR up, nothing left to heal
[5:38:04] Orgabism: That evoker is considered a dps now?
[5:38:07] caradea_: lmao ad
[5:38:24] Sombregard: @Sombregard maybe in a caster heavy dungeon
[5:40:44] Funkytree: I guess some testing would be needed :P after I've seen Andy do Echelon on I think 28 tyra without a healer cuz he died, Im  not gonna say smth is not possible cuz ppl do be crazy
[5:41:09] Whitewolf1441: ppl do be crazy indeed
[5:41:40] scheriel: obvious choice! Shaman needs a nerf
[5:41:40] ole94_: lmao

[5:47:55] Whitewolf1441: @KembriaTV ok sorry im afk between dungeons
[5:48:18] KembriaTV: They suspected it to be a no-healer dungeon, and teams likely didn't want to practise it
[5:49:16] Zircons: its wizard weekend
[5:49:21] s_dawg1: There was an unholy
