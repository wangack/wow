[0:16:26] thommy_brasco: i dont get it why, cause im using a cancelmacro as a druid aswell.. and it works
[0:16:29] itsmekaisar: Engraver is bis

[0:23:49] shoniewow: qhy
[0:24:09] shoniewow: @Hydramist my guild say i need to play my mage for pve but i like my main shadow :( for pvp and pve
[0:25:58] Sinostra: are you gonna click moonkin aswell ?
[0:26:19] shoniewow: shadow is still solide till 60 or?
[0:26:22] Danimal_Media: leave the guild find new one
[0:26:34] notgarru: delete your mage, problem solved
[0:26:47] Danimal_Media: @notgarru legit
[0:27:33] itsmekaisar: i would fuck off gquit if im in need to play mage
[0:27:43] Danimal_Media: best mark this for a rant for a short LUL
[0:27:51] shoniewow: thank u , i got u <3
[0:28:02] Linaro: KEKW  go off m8
[0:28:04] Danimal_Media: @shoniewow we got you bro
[0:28:06] funkyzied: this is the best take
[0:28:08] funkyzied: clip it
[0:28:09] MazzleTV: 90% of the classic player base feels like they're completely new to the game
[0:28:12] Tdogggg1: daddy chill
[0:28:24] Linaro: I agree!
[0:28:27] Greyu: They think SoD is retail Kappa
[0:28:31] deadzyloll: preach <3
[0:28:35] itsmekaisar: or ppl that willing to lern
[0:28:49] luzid7: yeah its carzy how the mentality is atm people think everyone without 90+ parses is a bad gamer
[0:29:19] Danimal_Media: need a agents of brill EU guild tbh no fucking parser andy goons allowed
[0:30:01] Danimal_Media: carry by the warrior dps Kappa
[0:30:29] Revansoon: oop
[0:30:30] Danimal_Media: LUL
[0:30:34] luzid7: and the thing is that all the parse andys leav the raid after 1 raid. so you don't clear the raid because of them and not because of new player or player that don't do much dmg ^^
[0:31:01] Danimal_Media: just enjoy blasting and having fun with your group
[0:31:23] Sinostra: yeah, but you also always want the best parses
[0:31:26] Linaro: i guess people are trying to make the game interesting by min-maxing, because it is too easy
[0:31:31] HideLemonsYo: got no problem with min maxing, some absolute shitters that play wow and want to be carried
[0:32:00] notgarru: keep the rant going you can get a 10min yt vid and get that EZ ad revenue
[0:32:11] thommy_brasco: hell yeah, i love it to what i tuned in haha
[0:32:18] Art1STxtv: Chat gpt thinks your name is Jake Kwon and that you're an exceptional PvP rogue
[0:32:25] Danimal_Media: retails bad for it too in mythic plus
[0:32:37] Art1STxtv: I corrected him
[0:32:42] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[0:33:03] Amandusz: Did you ever try m+ mate? never saw you play it :)
[0:33:04] HideLemonsYo: failing a key is the same as not clearing bosses no?
[0:33:18] ero__oce: m+ is only worth doing with a permade team, pugging is pain, just bricking keys, ppl rage quiting after 1 wipe

[0:34:39] ephixa_fan: hi
[0:35:04] ephixa_fan: I'm not Andreas
[0:35:08] shoniewow: how long you take time for your lvl so far?
[0:35:21] HideLemonsYo: fair, you talking about shitters wanting to min max i thought you meant overall
[0:35:22] ero__oce: @shoniewow top left of screen
[0:35:26] peeweeherman69: so you need like 3 binds for druid?
[0:35:35] ch0wder92: get the boooooon
[0:36:20] In_Stillness: what server is popping on EU now:? Wanna play where most likeminded people are
[0:36:58] Linaro: maybe they need mage to make water LUL
[0:37:23] HideLemonsYo: yeah theyre not thinknig about how can i improve its this is whats said is best we need that
[0:37:29] Sinostra: or to portal after the raid
[0:37:34] In_Stillness: That's what I heard
[0:37:35] In_Stillness: ty
[0:37:52] In_Stillness: everyone rolling horde it seems too
[0:38:04] In_Stillness: might have to make a shammy
[0:38:39] HideLemonsYo: this is all your years of arena kicking in xD
[0:39:20] borkensonbork: @Hydramist how do you feel about all the wcl ranking tooltip addon drama?
[0:39:49] Revansoon: we get less deaths on the last 2 bosses than electrocutiner at this point
[0:40:01] 0dceus: hello lads? what is the weak aura abovee the player frame? the one that looks like a rotation thingie
[0:40:02] In_Stillness: look after the pebbles and the rocks will look after themselves
[0:40:18] Teplokot: @Hydramist HeyGuys will you be leveling on Living Flame or you are done with EU?
[0:40:22] Falahaaaaa: alot of road talk suddently
[0:40:40] Danimal_Media: fucking pebble focusers
[0:40:49] Baxxtah: thats cause pebbles are easy
[0:41:07] Sinostra: just CC the rocks, focus pebbles
[0:41:08] In_Stillness: pebbles are then easily to resolve once rocks are cleared. more bitesized chunks
[0:42:15] Baxxtah: best TED talk
[0:42:25] MarkyOchoa: They're MINERALS
[0:42:28] Sinostra: didn't you need  to fix all the pebbles to get r1 tho ?
[0:42:33] Danimal_Media: sometimes you kick pebbles while moving them rocks
[0:42:39] In_Stillness: the obstacle is the way, that's what your saying essentially
[0:42:48] luzid7: i don't cleared the raid 1 time and it was in a parse run because people just left the grp after 1 wipe xd
[0:42:58] HideLemonsYo: If you dont shout AV IT when you kick a pebble youre doing something wrong
[0:43:30] HideLemonsYo: TRUE
[0:43:34] HideLemonsYo: straight over the fence
[0:43:42] In_Stillness: savage
[0:43:43] Danimal_Media: is it acceptable to do that at 35?
[0:43:59] In_Stillness: AV IT LADS go and get that one as it rolls down the street never to be seem again
[0:44:12] funkyzied: What was it like growing up in the UK for you? LIke being a kid at school and things like that
[0:44:14] Danimal_Media: true LUL
[0:44:40] Danimal_Media: mrs is a primary school teacher the situation could arise...
[0:44:43] In_Stillness: hydra have you looked at the stat for your viewers? like what countries are you top 5-6 watchers
[0:44:45] prodigy_wow: Leveling is kind of addicting with the exp boost, lots of dopamine
[0:45:21] Danimal_Media: more likely to curl it top bins and yell ronaldinho and they would ask who that was LUL
[0:45:28] In_Stillness: I haven't played s02 of SOD yet might come back after the boost
[0:45:30] Amandusz: Is feral an option to lvl as or is Balance just simpy the besT?

[6:49:31] sanders163: SeemsGood
[6:49:42] PerplexOW: @Hydramist classicauradurations was heavily nerfed by the most recent blizzard patch. you cant see auras unless they gain the aura while in range of you now
[6:50:20] PerplexOW: I agree with you. Especially cause they let ClassicAuraDurations work for 3 years
[6:50:50] Sinostra: if they display buffs, they render reveal magic useless
[6:50:56] PerplexOW: However from their perspective it was a bug i guess. It's not technically blizzlike to see enemy auras from before you interacted with them. But waiting 3 years to change it is very fried
[6:51:32] PerplexOW: yup agreed. buffs and nameplates need to be in
[6:51:46] Kiroxx: all i want is a fking focus target

[7:10:08] ghowstyuink: i did that on my 30 druid with the fences on the other side
[7:10:13] BeeMcG: I think there is an option to get rune without killing her or maybe just for night elfs not sure but you auto completed dialog
[7:10:19] thommy_brasco: yes
[7:10:21] Hypasonics: behind
[7:10:23] ghowstyuink: and took me more than 30 min before someone helped me

[8:21:32] Sinostra: can't you train dash at this level ?
[8:24:03] Akrew09: GO PLAY CATA
[8:24:23] Akrew09: yes but go play cata when comes
[8:24:26] Akrew09: not that Sod madness
[8:24:31] Sinostra: can't you ding here ?
[8:24:58] Akrew09: Cata was awesome
[8:25:05] MarmeN28: Cata is dog
[8:25:06] Akrew09: no
[8:25:07] QqmoreTV: I stopped playing when cata came out they fucked mana so hard for healers
[8:25:16] Coilwork: cata was shit
[8:25:18] Akrew09: Cata pvp was also cool i also played it back
[8:25:21] Wolf_Monster: why?
[8:25:29] arcaner_: weird take
[8:25:34] tdbeach1985: isnt it 1am for you?
[8:25:38] Wolf_Monster: what made it so bad?
[8:25:44] peeweeherman69: all i remmeber from cata is the stupid fucking swords that spawned tentacles
[8:25:45] QqmoreTV: truth
[8:25:46] Einewassa: wasnt cata the start of rated bgs?
[8:25:55] arcaner_: you can use that same argument for wotlk
[8:25:55] Coilwork: i liked cata when i got my legendary daggers PepeLaugh
[8:26:02] agret_: Cata PvE was a good time
[8:26:03] Zelimeth: could be true, i was young and cata was my first fave xpan
[8:26:06] Akrew09: i am same age as you brother, and i liked cata so much i cant tell better
[8:26:06] Zelimeth: into mop
[8:26:13] Deaddovedonoteat: i started in vanilla & quit after clearing my first raid in cata :)
[8:26:23] Akrew09: i started pvp more in cata, i dont liked the INBALANCE between classes in TBC and also wotlk was broken
[8:26:28] Akrew09: cata bring some of balance for pvp
[8:26:33] agret_: I played every expansion, loved Cata.
[8:26:44] arcaner_: had the most fun by far in mop then cata for pvp
[8:26:50] Akrew09: ye bro you played TBC a lot as pvp -er
[8:26:59] Akrew09: and TBC was the shittiest from a pvp perspective
[8:27:12] Akrew09: there was like 2 healer class u can play couse they dominating the others
[8:27:14] peeweeherman69: blizz must be loling releasing 10 year old content
[8:27:19] Akrew09: and also the DPS classes were like craze inbalanced
[8:27:32] MazzleTV: @Akrew09 clearly u dont remember feral druids if u talk about cata being balanced lol
[8:27:44] arcaner_: cata was much more balanced than tbc in pvp lol
[8:27:48] Sinostra: at the end of the day, it's just our opinions
[8:27:49] arcaner_: you cant argue otherweise
[8:27:56] Akrew09: Rog/Mage Lock/Rdruid or Dpriest Warri/Rdruid  3 comp that dominating the rest
[8:27:59] Akrew09: no other setup viable
[8:28:01] Sinostra: ofc we're gonna disagree on some things
[8:28:06] Akrew09: yes its means brother XD
[8:28:20] Akrew09: like why is good when u check ladder and like the top 2000 teams are the same comp? :D
[8:28:22] arcaner_: i think in pvp, balance is important... the more specs that are viable, the more enjoyable the game is
[8:28:29] Akrew09: yes
[8:28:32] Akrew09: thats i am talking about
[8:28:39] rabscuttled: !talents
[8:28:39] Nightbot: Shadow Talents: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-XptVsA3A0 /// Disc Talents: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmAxwZ8lzYs
[8:29:06] Akrew09: its allright
[8:29:11] Akrew09: i get your point
[8:29:25] Coilwork: to me, it's more important that every class has a viable specc
[8:29:27] Sinostra: hey Hydra, shouldn't you kill yetis to ding 32 ?
[8:29:49] arcaner_: different target audience i guess. i cant play the same classi/spec for an entire expansion in the same arena games. i get really bored
[8:30:01] Akrew09: you are a priest guy and u dont like cata couse priest was dogshit in cata, sham healers and paladins are getting balanced to your state and they can also beat you
[8:30:24] Sinostra: wait
[8:30:26] peeweeherman69: must have 50iq if you enjoy playing same patch for 10 years
[8:30:28] Coilwork: How can one expect to play a class/specc for a year to begin with
[8:30:32] Sinostra: didn't you have the hammerfall FP ?
[8:30:39] Sinostra: flyyyyyyyyyyyyypath
[8:31:09] arcaner_: wow never has esport potential
[8:31:10] Akrew09: esport people can play multiple classes
[8:31:20] arcaner_: but yeah
[8:31:33] Shatteredlol: @Hydramist Cata was so bad for pvp, MOP wasnt too bad tho!
[8:31:34] arcaner_: from a very high level point of view, i understand what you are saying
[8:31:57] arcaner_: what is your opinion on wotlk pvp
[8:32:11] Akrew09: cata was more of a player skill than bring the class
[8:32:11] Zelimeth: is it fair to say u may have a biased opinion cos disc felt shit? that was an impression i got from ur vid - or did cata not have as much depth and strategy to it
[8:32:15] Akrew09: in my opinion
[8:32:19] Akrew09: and its same for pvp and pve
[8:32:19] playboifranklin: lol akrew..
[8:32:22] playboifranklin: pls stop
[8:32:25] amexpog: hi hydra
[8:32:54] Shatteredlol: @Hydramist Cata is almost as bad WoD
[8:32:57] drwaldorph: mls xdxdxd
[8:32:57] peterdeleterz: how was feral

[8:33:10] MazzleTV: wasnt it in cata feral got insta clone and completely ran everything
[8:33:11] Akrew09: i played both WOD and CATA. Cata was WAY WAY WAY Better.
[8:33:18] Sinostra: RMP was still good tho
[8:33:26] Akrew09: In PVE -> Its S Tier and in PVP its good also.
[8:33:48] arcaner_: wod ruined the game for me with the ability prune
[8:34:21] arcaner_: i dont recall losing abilities in cata that i cared about
[8:34:35] Zelimeth: maybe cata classic might be OK? tbc classic surprised us how good it was
[8:34:46] Sinostra: mop was the ability prune to me
[8:35:26] arcaner_: was that remedied with the final patch in cata?
[8:36:14] teublife: amazing song
[8:36:30] Akrew09: Yes PVP was not about playing your joker cards, and zerging the enemy
[8:36:37] Akrew09: like it was in TBC
[8:36:38] Zelimeth: cata the birth of drainer comps
[8:36:48] Akrew09: i remember how good was getting a 15 sec CC chain and getting killed
[8:36:50] Akrew09: wow nice
[8:37:21] Akrew09: yes tbc was so nice bro, getting CC-ed by Mage/Rog for 20 sec and wathicng your teammate getting fuked was so nice
[8:37:57] Akrew09: yes cata pvp was getting close to retail pvp
[8:38:06] Zelimeth: cant wait for x5 monkey stun + ros
[8:38:18] Akrew09: and its good, who the fk wants to play classic pvp where eveyrhing was in baby feet and the game was inbalanced like shit
[8:38:34] Sinostra: remember triple dps ?
[8:38:48] MarmeN28: rogue,ret, hunter
[8:38:51] MarmeN28: have fun guys
[8:38:54] Zelimeth: icematikz, ben, blazin days
[8:39:10] MarmeN28: even worse in last season when all pve shit is in real play
[8:39:23] trawarica: good music bro
[8:39:30] amouranth_subscriber: FirstTimeChatter
[8:39:31] arcaner_: @MarmeN28 isnt that what currently exists in wotlk
[8:39:41] drwaldorph: mage mage rogue was funny
[8:39:42] MarmeN28: not the same
[8:39:52] MarmeN28: some random trincket that spread dmg in RBG to whole team
[8:39:58] ndras: i had fun playing dk ret war
[8:39:59] Sinostra: triple dps shouldn't exist
[8:40:00] MarmeN28: you got that in wotlk?
[8:40:01] amouranth_subscriber: h0w bad is retail wow rn
[8:40:02] arcaner_: the shadowbolt trinket?
[8:40:10] MarmeN28: ya cunning
[8:40:16] MarmeN28: plus leggo staff
[8:40:19] MarmeN28: have fun in rbg
[8:40:21] arcaner_: i take more issue with legendaries
[8:40:22] MarmeN28: x3 boomys
[8:40:27] ndras: necro strike necro strike necro strike LUL
[8:40:31] drwaldorph: vial of shadows pre nerf
[8:40:36] drwaldorph: my first 2k as a 13 year old kek
[8:40:53] arcaner_: they fixed that issue in mop right?i dont recall pve gear being bis in pvp
[8:41:10] MarmeN28: ye
[8:41:13] Extramediums: Cata is where I stopped playing pvp seriously.
[8:41:19] Extramediums: because everything about it was garbage
[8:41:28] arcaner_: @Extramediums bit harsh
[8:43:05] Extramediums: I was never a r1 player, I was a few season glad, and honestly, the moment they gave every single dps abilities to make them fully self sufficient in regular content, not needing to drink, or worry about health, on top of all the god awful balancing of classes, on top of the direction of the game going into 'well, we're pruning, but not really, we're homogenizing literally everything'.
[8:43:12] arcane_p: what was good about Cats pvp? I am debating playing it
[8:43:24] arcaner_: was during wrath yes
[8:43:27] Zelimeth: celestial steed was wrath i think
[8:43:36] bockylockie: yeah end of wrath
[8:43:43] ndras: ye clestial was in wrath
[8:43:54] ndras: like ghost invicible holy shit that was bad
[8:44:14] Extramediums: server communities died, thanks for group finder and then raid finder
[8:44:14] Sinostra: did you pick your talent ?
[8:44:16] flemminggXD: im not touching cata
[8:44:35] ndras: playable goblins were cool ill give them that
[8:44:41] ndras: sod needs playable goblins
[8:44:47] arcane_p: can someone tell me some good things about wrath?
[8:44:55] arcane_p: I never played it
[8:45:10] Extramediums: as soon as I saw shit like recuperate, and second wind and all that shit, I knew the game was going in a direction of every one can do everything
[8:45:12] arcane_p: also I want to try arena in wrath
[8:45:21] MarmeN28: i am actually sitting here and i am mad now when we talk about cata, its kinda sad how the game went from good to complete dog for pvp
[8:46:17] Sinostra: @Extramediums second wind already existed in wrath
[8:46:27] Sinostra: wrong example
[8:46:47] itsmekaisar: just play what make the most fun to u
[8:46:50] Extramediums: @Sinostra not in the rendition it was in cata that was braindead
[8:47:01] Coilwork: i play wow while waiting for new PoE leagues PepeLaugh
[8:47:40] Extramediums: cata came out, healing on priest was the worst it's ever been, ret palla couldn't do damage to warrior, warrior second wind below whatever the threshold was at the time healed through tons of dps's classes damage, etc
[8:47:50] dopezs: Why do you hate cata ? what changes u did dislike ??
[8:48:24] dopezs: Ok ill check it out
[8:48:50] Extramediums: Cata was where wow took a shift into being the COD of MMO's instead of being an MMO
[8:49:25] braln1: i feel like og wow players are done after wotlk ... the game changed for the worst from there.
[8:49:30] miko3x: @Extramediums no shot I play cata its booty
[8:50:24] itsmekaisar: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[8:50:56] arcaner_: i think the og wow players dipped once tbc flying ruined wpvp
[8:51:13] thenewguy176: SWIFTY?!
[8:52:10] MarmeN28: Swifty come on haha ^^
[8:52:27] itsmekaisar: im out gn @all
[8:52:48] braln1: let's hope they'll balance the SoD PVP a little
[8:52:52] Frig0z: @arcane_p it's hard to overstate how bad flying was for the game tbh
[8:53:20] Coilwork: which is fine tbh
[8:53:22] Sinostra: wanna do the blood moon in 40 minutes ?
[8:53:22] braln1: i said the exact same thing to a friend , that's where you know what all classes are capable of
[8:53:53] AlphonzeVII: the balancing is not that terrible considering
[8:54:22] thenewguy176: don't fuck up teh schedule prayge
[8:54:32] braln1: true  , it's somewhat decent
[8:54:39] MarmeN28: GN i am out for today, keep it up hydra your the best !!
[8:54:55] Frig0z: It's pretty fun at least
[8:54:56] Sinostra: pvp is too bursty atm tho
[8:55:27] Coilwork: gonna be fun to see what they do at 60 with all the dungeons and so on
[8:55:29] AlphonzeVII: pve gear should have at least SOME stam
[8:55:44] MazzleTV: i'd like bigger health pools and mana pools, dunno if mana would unbalance the game too much but still
[8:55:46] braln1: they should put stuff like rewards after clearing a team , to keep you farming , casters/healer need to drink after fighting a team
[8:55:55] AlphonzeVII: irradiated only exception cuz its the trade off
[8:56:08] braln1: like getting hp/mana regen after fully wiping a team of 5
[8:57:24] AlphonzeVII: some of the ruins in STV arent even LoS lol
[8:57:55] Zelimeth: too complicated for blizz, they cant get normal layering done right
[8:58:01] AlphonzeVII: you want it like a battle royale?
[8:58:49] Sinostra: thing is, layers aren't meant for that
[8:59:03] Hozitojones: hola
[8:59:17] xtinzyx: that idea seems like squads in fortnite battle royale. -> drop -> kill -> if u die u out
[8:59:37] xtinzyx: would be fun
[9:01:06] Kiroxx: EPL dodge hopefully
[9:01:23] xtinzyx: u know the arena they added in hardcore? they could make that but ffa everyone vs eachother. last man standing. or a party mode, last team standing gets a certain amount of blod
[9:01:29] xtinzyx: blood*
[9:01:50] xtinzyx: yah
[9:02:05] Kiroxx: EPL Battle Royal would be superb
[9:02:22] Kiroxx: wod was huge, cuz u could win as healer

[9:05:27] DeathToad007: no to wow fortnite
[9:05:29] SpaceGrape: What addon shows the damage of spells on the action bar?
[9:05:33] ironpallyone: they need to have random stealth eyes that let you find rogues in the zone also
[9:05:34] DeathToad007: gn brother
[9:05:35] xtinzyx: goodnight
[9:05:37] Sinostra: gn
