[2:34:49] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: It's like Godzilla and Goku if he was shenron mixed into one
[2:34:56] Capnrein: you need to download more RAM
[2:35:18] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Reminds me of your chat all the time this is why I'm looking for a new computer
[2:35:24] Spart4nm4n: MORE DEDOTATED WAM!!!

[2:35:43] hilarious_darius_: the hall is nice^^
[2:35:44] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Bad thing about it you need at least 24 gigs of VRAM to play VR chat properly That's why I don't like playing VR chatting VR because of the lag from other people's avatars
[2:35:48] darthyapper: hello there @Swifty
[2:35:51] danswann31: your arms are eceptionally white
[2:36:13] Capnrein: What's the wecommended amount of dedotated wam I should have to a survr ?
[2:36:26] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Very similar to particle effects any particle effect in VR if you're playing standalone through PCVR air link is bound to lag you VR chat is known for that

[2:54:42] SSD511_: he should try AV
[2:54:56] slidd: Isn't WoW CPU based?
[2:55:11] BoricuaSJ: $400 https://www.ebay.com/itm/394675921236
[2:55:25] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Oh hey at least it's not as bad as VR chat that is the most poorly optimized game in all of history you literally have to have a 490 or a 3060 because the game is a hog for VRAM It doesn't matter what kind of graphics card you have as long as the graphics card itself's RAM hence VRAM is very high
[2:55:33] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: It's a glutton for VRAM not sure why always been that way though
[2:55:38] BoricuaSJ: but says local pickup only
[2:55:39] savagestrix: @slidd its not cpu based but mmos are generally intense on the cpu
[2:55:50] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: That's why I'm debating I'm playing it right now I want to hop in VR so bad but your chat ehhhh
[2:57:19] SSD511_: feelGood
