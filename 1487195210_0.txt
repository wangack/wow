[0:11:56] Armdel: i guess that titles means the announcement is for one of the phones games, most likely arclight?
[0:12:08] Armdel: unless they decided to launch Diablo early
[0:12:37] Crowargus: na theyd give a date for immortal surely instead of springing it on ppl

[0:13:37] vulkankragon: guys bad news. In diablo immortal the barbarian cannot wield 2 handed big weapons, he can only dual wield.

[1:00:44] Narecotics: Diablo immortal only two weeks out, why would they do a beta?
[1:00:56] Turet78: I wish they still announce DF alpha or preorder tonight along with the Arclight stuff

[1:08:42] TheCliffyShow: Disappointed Iron Docks got the other spot. I was hoping for Everbloom.
[1:08:43] MR_WYTE: @Towelliee - hey Tow, what are you using now to manage addons since Curseforge removed access to third-party apps (i.e. WoWup)? Thanks.
[1:08:44] reggiepowa: do upper kara
[1:08:46] BoezIRL: why can't they just put the max stack at 5000?
[1:08:51] ArcaneSyntax: Mechagon workshop
[1:08:51] Greenfeuer: And more bank storage
[1:09:01] MR_WYTE: !wowup
[1:09:10] BoezIRL: @MR_WYTE he's using curseforge
[1:09:31] TheCliffyShow: I heard cross-faction doesn't apply to heroic group finder. I imagine LFR would be the same.
[1:09:36] MR_WYTE: @BoezIRL Ah, thanks man. I've heard so much crap about their client. I'm hesitant. :(
[1:10:04] Dyasis: @MR_WYTE they have a new stand alone version that doesn't include overwolf
[1:10:14] BoezIRL: because you had to use overwolf, now you can download a standalone version
[1:10:14] MrGharr: they should just invent account bound currencies.
[1:10:44] luckfore: elvui
[1:10:46] MR_WYTE: @Dyasis / @BoezIRL Oh?! Thanks! I'll check it out. I thought Overwolf effectively owned and developed all Curse stuff now - didn't know I had a choice.

[2:00:54] luckfore: they are for 9.0 LUL
[2:00:55] MisterYeeticus: I think ElvUI uses several folders. Not just Interface - I might be wrong though. It might just re-generate what's missing.

[2:01:00] Lightninghandz: I'm hoping they break all the custom UIs people are using and force them into what the game is using, terrible for new players to see this crap

[2:26:40] akia03: is this affix also in the raids?
[2:27:02] emznev: 8.3 Affix was the best
[2:27:30] jerexify: @Towelliee Is it always Vers? I thought for some reason it would change.
[2:28:19] Odd3ty: !affix
[2:28:33] EthicalHermit: Have fun with Sanguine right there
[2:28:35] Clicklesly: You can pick it at start, it just defaults to Vers if you don't ^^

[2:32:52] jerexify: What's with the "pal"? "You're not that guy pal. Trust me, you're not that guy." Is that you?
[2:33:16] herpderpdoublederp: rag and az have the worst players I have ever seen, and the most toxic, but that;s just anecdotal
[2:33:22] theDirtyon3: I am one of the people who voted for this and seeing people in pain is gonna make me happy

[2:44:08] jerexify: @zeitgeiz Ah, gotcha. That makes more sense. If he's about to ZM, he's almost to the 2x leggo point, so he is close.
[2:44:36] theDirtyon3: @zeitgeiz kinda sounds like your friends just doesnt like to gear up..thats half the fun in this game. May not be for him
[2:44:57] magemaster225: I think they added portals to the dungeons in oribos
[2:45:01] MayroVision: I haven’t played since panda, so I’m just curious. When you start a new toon, do you start in a BFA zone? Or do you start in traditional new zones?

[2:51:37] Thoreya: i wonder if mech braces for mage will be good again
[2:51:38] Quakezilla69: @Darwoo uhh, in general i would say easy, but like with most things little things people can do to set themselves apart from being a mediocre tank to a great tank
[2:51:51] Thoreya: bracers*
[2:51:53] bankier9999: bankier9999 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:51:54] skdmaster: Drathos video said if you don't talk to the broker you will get verse
[2:51:59] Keyastaron_: what's the affix for season 4?
[2:52:16] Keyastaron_: shrouded?
[2:52:43] Keyastaron_: is.... is this iron docks
[2:53:00] MILESkg21: yes its THE DOCKS FeelsGoodMan

[2:53:27] dreamwalker213: lower kara has a 42 min timer, gross
[2:53:39] MILESkg21: 42 min WTF WutFace
[2:53:42] zeitgeiz: 42min, ouch
[2:53:49] dutchie76: @MilesKG21 LUL
[2:54:00] Keyastaron_: see if you can get loads of mobs and use the wheels Kreygasm
[2:54:01] Thoreya: another DoS..nice
[2:54:07] zeitgeiz: Wrb MoS like dungeon option
[2:54:19] Keyastaron_: pog it works
[2:54:19] Gunfluster: wtf that gives %
[2:54:22] Thoreya: yea
[2:54:23] Gunfluster: thats so busted
[2:54:25] Keyastaron_: yes
[2:54:26] MILESkg21: HAXX KEKW
[2:54:28] dutchie76: kek
[2:54:28] theDirtyon3: LUL
[2:54:33] Amarlian: Bowling for percentage
[2:54:34] Alllprimer: Nice!
[2:54:35] Turet78: Ohh it gave % noo way
[2:54:37] ZujuZapp: it used to count in challenge modes
[2:54:37] theDirtyon3: EZ route
[2:54:49] Keyastaron_: GET ALLL THE MOBS BRING EM BACK Kappa and use the wheels POGGERS EXPOLIT FOUND
[2:54:49] TheCliffyShow: The wheels on the dock go round and round.
[2:54:52] A_t_r_i: that seems abusable
[2:54:56] ursinealli: there isn't a lot of trash left in the dungeon, why shouldn't it count?
[2:55:00] ZujuZapp: i remember pulling extra stuff into the iron stars
[2:55:07] Dyasis: working as intended...
[2:55:39] Gunfluster: you could get a decent skip before the last 2 bosses
[2:55:40] DannyColdCuts: Hey Towelliee, what was that software that you mentioned one time where you can stream using your internet bandwidth/resources. I wasn't sure what the name was
[2:55:49] Sollice: NDI
[2:56:11] MILESkg21: FeelsGoodMan /
[2:56:11] PvtHudson093: raid were fun
[2:56:12] willy_billy_silly: so will be farming old content for tmog stop during this
[2:56:15] temp3st98: me :)
[2:56:18] Pumbaaa123: Wod dungeons m+???
[2:56:24] SG_World: april fools all the time
[2:56:26] MILESkg21: RISE MOUNTAIN
[2:56:28] GraaMee: The raiding was good but sdalyt that was all there was to do
[2:56:41] Nerendis: small one first
[2:56:43] Bayne77: WoD had the best Garrisons in the game
[2:56:44] Gunfluster: healer > goblin > orc
[2:56:55] Quakezilla69: I do caster
[2:57:02] Nerendis: goblin has to be first because she can 1 shot
[2:57:11] DannyColdCuts: @Sollice is that the software suite im looking for?
[2:57:12] Bennodkk: tierset sttill works season 4?
[2:57:36] skittlesman09: yea
[2:57:42] zeitgeiz: For high end raider and pvpers WoD was perfect since they don’t like to engage in anything except raid/arena. They could make gold, do their content, and never do anything else
[2:57:57] Sollice: @Sollice NDI is the technology. I believe you do download something on both PCs and you setup NDI as a source in OBS
[2:58:10] critin87: ptr ptr yeah
[2:58:16] DannyColdCuts: @Sollice ah ok. thanks for your help!!
[2:58:21] Sollice: Look for NDI Tools
[2:58:40] Gunfluster: wod was great, because you could get gold from garrison, raid, and then play hearthstone
[2:58:41] Mistery836: w8.. are WoD dungeons going to be added in S4?! towPog
[2:58:58] Dyasis: @Mistery836 only 2
[2:59:06] zeitgeiz: @mistery836 yes, grimrail depot and iron docks
[2:59:14] Turet78: Junkyard had some interesting places but not that off from the usual route
[2:59:16] Mistery836: @Mistery836 but they are going to be added in s4?
[2:59:25] Mistery836: @Mistery836 still nice though
[2:59:32] Dyasis: @Mistery836 yes
[2:59:36] zeitgeiz: Not sure why the community picked these two…better choices out there
[3:01:04] Mistery836: irondocks is fun, but it's a bit too big arena wise
[3:01:06] Nerendis: Why would they let the community vote anyway
[3:01:13] Samurai3434: I voted skyreach... def not grimrail
[3:01:14] TheCliffyShow: I voted for Grimrail because I like it. My other vote was for Everbloom.
[3:01:34] tampooon: @Towelliee and bliz knew it was a troll and was like "haha ok you got it lulz"
[3:01:35] MILESkg21: i hated Everbloom
[3:01:37] dimofodi: I feel bad voting for it. In my defense, I had no clue which each option was and I asked people in my guild and they all said to do that.
[3:01:40] Nerendis: Honestly most WOD dungeons were great, except grimrail
[3:01:43] zeitgeiz: I think Iron docks would have been better if the 2nd one hadn’t been grimrail. Just two dungeons the same color and feel
[3:01:44] dutchie76: everbloom eh
[3:01:45] menethas1: auchindoun is fun, but m+'ers hate dungeon RP events

[3:02:59] lithium364: i voted grimrail to make m+ runners suffer in high keys
[3:02:59] Mistery836: @RadRage69 what shadowlands? Kappa
[3:03:03] MILESkg21: they were all troll votes 4Head
[3:03:11] Nerendis: I mean let's be honest, the people who voted for grimrail are trolls and classic players messing with retail players
[3:04:09] ijuki: Iron Docks: Gold POGGERS

[3:04:27] shobolt1980: why cosmic flux??
[3:04:30] TheCliffyShow: I voted for Grimrail because I like it.
[3:04:51] Thoreya: i wonder if mech bracers are gonna be good again for mages in s4

[3:05:20] akia03: its super short tho
[3:05:28] dreamwalker213: @Samurai3434 by the end, pretty much
[3:05:32] Mistery836: btw 15 mins for a dungeon is SeemsGood
[3:05:36] board4life65: as no good gear comes from Grimrail
[3:06:22] RoboMaximillion: thanks actually
[3:06:24] critin87: it's  mostly plate in grim rail right
[3:06:27] RoboMaximillion: that is annoying me lol
[3:07:20] TompsonX: It's also bad in OSRS
[3:07:43] MILESkg21: a what KEKW
[3:07:50] Mozzeyy_: It involves community though
[3:08:11] TheCliffyShow: Now, what's wrong with Everbloom.
[3:08:13] raye_gaming22: everbloom was not even that bad
[3:08:16] kipduran: vote should be in game so only people paying and playing get to vote
[3:08:17] ijuki: Who is Towelliee ? Kappa
[3:08:21] dreamwalker213: i think them doing a vote is a good idea tbh, community can just never be trusted to take it seriously
[3:08:29] generaljosh721: They should do in game voting booths like osrs. You have to have an active game sub to vote
[3:08:32] MILESkg21: EB was garbage and u know it KEKW
[3:08:39] Jarlan23: i remember asmongold told everyone to vote for that cat slime mount when they did the poll
[3:08:42] ijuki: @kipduran That is actually genious
[3:08:43] Jarlan23: it moved a few %
[3:08:45] fred_birkhoff: yep, i followed asmongold for like a bit when lost ark came out ... i unfollowed when i saw what kind of cult he's running there. he talks viewers nod. it's unsettling monkaS
[3:08:49] dimofodi: only people with a m+ score over 3500 should get to vote
[3:08:52] dimofodi: :D
[3:08:52] lithium364: just so that were clear here guys, if they make us vote for cataclysm m+ i WILL vote for halls of origination M+ with an 40 min timer
[3:08:55] TheKitsuneAdventures: i vote for  towelliee  president
[3:08:57] ZeusDNA: OSRS has some kind of community voting for content stuff. Should copy that
[3:09:00] Clicklesly: Voting booth should be at the end of +20s only Kappa
[3:09:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, OSRS with their in-game voting figured it out

[3:09:40] Jarlan23: @Theduskflyer having polls in-game would cost us a raid tier Kappa
[3:09:53] warrenny: Im voting sm
[3:09:56] zeitgeiz: Asmon basically told his stream to vote GRD by saying he hated it. They are always going to try and troll him
[3:09:56] raye_gaming22: ill vote for seat and catedral next time they are up for vote
[3:10:14] ijuki: @chizu_gaming monkaS x20
