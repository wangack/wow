[3:25:04] rbubbaray: yup
[3:25:07] foxxys856: what was worse was making a class do more damage around a leggy and u were utter useless if u didint have it due to rng
[3:25:08] Truthseeker96: @rbubbaray same thing rn
[3:25:11] rbubbaray: non stop grind
[3:25:26] Jumbomuffen: I remember me geting my first 3 legendaries and they all were my 3 BiS. While our other mage got every Leggy but the BiS ones. Took him over 3 months
[3:25:40] contendernumber: legendarys is not a good thing for the game imo
[3:25:43] foxxys856: by that time it was too late esp for casual people

[3:26:55] theprimetimelime: sephuz' secret was awesome for m+
[3:26:58] foxxys856: the amount of leggys they had wasn't good, and it ruined any chance for alot ppl due to the stupid rng system i got refused over ppl who had them because i never had my bis ones drop
[3:27:06] Truthseeker96: its about pvp. stuff being broken
[3:27:07] Truthseeker96: yea

[3:28:25] sheerheartattackyk: i literally got good legendaries at the end of the expansion wich sucks because well they were gonna  be useless at some point
[3:28:26] foxxys856: im super happy they released vaniila tbc and hopefuly wrath classic thats when the game was real fun

[4:13:15] goodtimechuck: @Tenacious__T If youre going for a fast run to 50, to run endgame, its faster to just do the main story quest, if you dont care, do the side quests too though
[4:13:22] GuyNotFromHarlem: Nice try
