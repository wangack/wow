[3:48:19] merlygood_: mages are broken
[3:48:20] kozmoraa: anyone with a slow fall and speed pot can get up there
[3:48:28] overheatedx: they should delete evo
[3:48:30] shloom995: when you crafting your epic ?
[3:48:47] ErobbIsWhite: no classes can do so much bullshit FeelsWeirdMan
[3:48:53] Marhazad: mana gem YEP
[3:48:53] bigsteve1015: yall just need a mana battery rune like pallys, just reduce healing so mage healers dont have infinite mana
[3:48:53] mr_az3k: should be a rune that turns evo into passive regen and adds arcane dam
[3:48:54] Trodenskjold: Its crazy how much mage players cry. Mages are for real the biggest bitches in wow
[3:48:57] Forlagon: yes lets make mages more broken by giving them no mana issues
[3:49:03] Lifeles85: Pog okay thats awesome
[3:49:04] BingoTingler: huge
[3:49:07] sepph_: buy the mount WeirdChamp
[3:49:08] bhert321: they need to make it for wsg too
[3:49:10] jimihendriks: There was this guy names Joecrumble in the guild (crusade) and he said graycen was so annoying that he deleted his lvl 40 toon and went to horde to join sodas guild
[3:49:10] DMGlol: yes because that means I never have to play AB
[3:49:12] BerkTheLUL: ab doesnt give shit for boomies. kinda dumb
[3:49:14] BingoTingler: common blizzard w
[3:49:24] Forlagon: shaman

[3:49:32] Horny_Captain_Falcon: I mean they are xdd
[3:49:34] ErobbIsWhite: they are 4Weird
[3:49:36] BingoTingler: just give mages more mana regen in pvp combat
[3:49:38] kywozen: w
[3:49:40] Lifeles85: they should add wsg faction to that
[3:49:41] dareohh: regarded class
[3:49:41] GTokie: im like a wet paper bag in pvp, level 39 and i got 1k health lol
[3:49:42] Jaeslow: as a hunter i live in aspect of viper now, shit is so easy
[3:49:43] bamboniiii: what a dick
[3:49:46] kirbz2011: hi gray son
[3:49:48] Totesmag0tes: that name
[3:49:48] Trodenskjold: SURE Buddy
[3:49:49] bamboniiii: @Graycen

[3:49:51] ErobbIsWhite: ?????????
[3:49:57] Totesmag0tes: bzzt
[3:50:02] dammitcyrus: hunters need hard NERFs
[3:50:02] Jaeslow: no
[3:50:05] Lifeles85: No
[3:50:06] Jaeslow: nope
[3:50:06] hekeh: no
[3:50:07] AlphaSimply: always on the fence
[3:50:07] Forlagon: im a shaman i dont have bubble
[3:50:08] Iol69: hell no
[3:50:09] overheatedx: your biased about thinking ur unbiased hah!
[3:50:10] grethedren: never
[3:50:14] AlphaSimply: yeah you just flip viper
[3:50:16] LazerDefender: what about a rune on legs so you gotta choose between mana or living bomb
[3:50:17] Lifeles85: I literally switch to viper for like 7 seconds and i'm full
[3:50:17] AlphaSimply: its so nice
[3:50:18] beastie_: I only see you play mage
[3:50:18] Trodenskjold: I like drinking
[3:50:20] baldanduseless: both fire and arcane are way more efficient than frost for long term fights @Graycen
[3:50:20] sepph_: Aware
[3:50:21] Horny_Captain_Falcon: I like drinking
[3:50:21] Totesmag0tes: no gups
[3:50:23] Jaeslow: mhm
[3:50:23] gay_fish69: Aware
[3:50:24] Bamu3099: u lose a lil dps with aspect of viper
[3:50:26] Austyz: if mage had unlimited mana though they might possibly be worried about the aoe farming / dungeon boosting being even crazier
[3:50:26] Starasta1234: KKonaW I love drinking brother
[3:50:28] Iol69: i drink irl to make up for drinking in game
[3:50:33] ErobbIsWhite: "lets just remove mana" idiota moment
[3:50:34] Totesmag0tes: some gups
[3:50:36] shloom995: i like yo drink water
[3:50:37] EmDuBB13: wait i might actually play sod now... thats my biggest gripe of classic.the mana issues
[3:50:40] shloom995: to*
[3:50:41] Dr__Pumpkin: every class is OP but warrior is DOG ASS and I don’t play warrior
[3:50:43] BingoTingler: there's a reason why mana isn't a major issue on retail in pvp for mages - only things like dispel and spellsteal cost mana
[3:50:44] DMGlol: fire is literally the oom spec om
[3:50:47] Leeroyjenkss: Thanks for STV grouop graycen, u a real one
[3:50:48] Wildboomkin: shootin deer and drinkin beer KKonaW
[3:50:51] BingoTingler: they could do something similar
[3:50:52] sepph_: auh
[3:50:54] baldanduseless: the crtit refund talent @Graycen
[3:50:56] Beakz______: boomy
[3:50:57] GoodGuyEli74: ranged hunter is lacking damage they should revert the chimera shot nerf at least
[3:51:03] GoodGuyEli74: idk why they did that
[3:51:05] Arcsilin: druid wtf
[3:51:06] Forlagon: cries in ele shaman
[3:51:08] Zashooo: affliction warlock
[3:51:10] Trodenskjold: @Leeroyjenkss Man this gotta be some kind of selfharm. Its sad to watch
[3:51:16] boyhasheart: youre putting off homeless girl vibes
[3:51:18] Iol69: @EmDuBB13 ya if u actually looked at sod and the updates themselves you'd definitely enjoy it i could bet
[3:51:18] scaff_24: mages always crying
[3:51:22] shloom995: no one playing ranged hunter
[3:51:22] scaff_24: COOKED
[3:51:25] BingoTingler: @boyhasheart lol
[3:51:28] Leeroyjenkss: @Trodenskjold ur mom dont love you?
[3:51:29] overheatedx: ret does if they dont have guarded by the light
[3:51:42] Dr__Pumpkin: melee hunter is like a better warrior and a better rogue right now
[3:51:43] Trodenskjold: @Trodenskjold She does. But tbh im not a big fan of her
[3:51:43] EmDuBB13: @Iol69 ok bet ill check it out :)
[3:51:45] hogwarts_dropout: I have played mage for 6 weeks now and don't think they need mana help. They are fine
[3:51:47] overheatedx: not as much as mage
[3:51:47] BingoTingler: i bet boomkin ooms too in pvp
[3:51:48] GoodGuyEli74: lock feels like shit in pvp ngl
[3:51:49] overheatedx: ele is not bad
[3:51:50] ipntheshower: ele shaman be drinking
[3:51:53] snimb: 85
[3:51:53] BingoTingler: starsurge offsets that though
[3:51:58] baldanduseless: sham rage is a free mana bar every minute?
[3:52:00] catjammespam: @GoodGuyEli74 true
[3:52:00] baldanduseless: i never oom on ele
[3:52:06] AlphaSimply: @GoodGuyEli74 agreed, and everyone is crying about melee hunters, just bc they are getting beat by one xdd
[3:52:11] BingoTingler: give mages starsurge call it arcane fall xdd
[3:52:15] overheatedx: ya sham rage is so nice
[3:52:17] Beakz______: boomy really bad rn
[3:52:17] ipntheshower: well i see shaman tanks ooming
[3:52:32] GoodGuyEli74: @GoodGuyEli74 ya but a melee hunter has to get in melee range its not like shadow priest boomkins who just 2 tap u every 6 secs
[3:52:34] kirbz2011: ill give u the tip
[3:52:44] Lifeles85: isn't there something that gives shaman tanks mana on block?
[3:52:47] sepph_: Just dont get hit 4Head
[3:52:51] BingoTingler: would you give up block for a starsurge like spell?
[3:52:53] Beakz______: promise u it is lol
[3:52:56] baldanduseless: i was thinking just for stv with 2 priest dont need barrier
[3:52:57] Wildboomkin: @Graycen  just your daily reminder that you look like the hamburglar
[3:52:59] itz_prismo: oda
[3:53:03] JTRoyson: Gustav: pungkula pungkula pungkula pungkula pungkula pungkula pung (silence) kula! (fart)
[3:53:04] GoodGuyEli74: boomkins crying are just mad they cant kill ppl every 6 secs now lol
[3:53:06] AllieQuack: for pve boomy is terrible
[3:53:06] Shak_ka: oda
[3:53:08] AlphaSimply: yeah theres more op classes people just dont realize, shadow priest dot ticks randomly Deadge you
[3:53:08] sepph_: @Wildboomkin mhm
[3:53:10] overheatedx: boomie is still good u just actually have to cast spells LOL
[3:53:12] dammitcyrus: it is
[3:53:15] dammitcyrus: ive been trying
[3:53:15] Leeroyjenkss: @Graycen did you see new Paladin boot rune, you get %5 of mana back per meele hit over 15 seconds, itss opppp
[3:53:19] DMGlol: most of the time it is
[3:53:20] shloom995: yes
[3:53:21] DOPBOP_: oda
[3:53:23] Zashooo: pungkula?
[3:53:23] Jaeslow: it locks every so often
[3:53:28] WingsDub: they should add a raid mechanic that acts like a life tap
[3:53:31] Iol69: boomies just cry
[3:53:32] BerkTheLUL: i dont think its terrible
[3:53:32] GoodGuyEli74: pretty sure they got buffed for pve
[3:53:34] jimihendriks: @Leeroyjenkss damn thats nuts
[3:53:35] DOPBOP_: oda fuck u Graycen oda
[3:53:39] dudeshamus: Evening everyone! hiHelloHi:)
[3:53:42] Beakz______: boomy has no defense and can do damage like everyone else but have to cast and go oom fast
[3:53:45] Leeroyjenkss: @jimihendriks fr
[3:53:46] AllieQuack: only class worse than boomy is paladin for dps, tanks sim more dps
[3:53:49] GoodGuyEli74: I think they do more damage but have to cast
[3:53:50] BingoTingler: they will do more in pve
[3:53:52] sepph_: hiHelloHi:)
[3:53:54] Iodobol: is shadow priest already nerfed?
[3:53:54] dudeshamus: Ah dang
[3:53:58] BerkTheLUL: PI kinda ruined pve parsing tho ngl
[3:53:58] dudeshamus: Hope they went well!
[3:53:59] Trodenskjold: Blizz locked Crusader Strike for alliance, to keep people from accidently making a char on the same server as you Graycen which would result in them quitting the game, and Blizz losing money
[3:54:04] bassey_: boomy offers spell crit
[3:54:08] seeyous8n: they are good and will be at the same spost as spriest after nerf
[3:54:17] BerkTheLUL: why would they bring PI to sod?
[3:54:18] itsBdaws: come to horde crusaderstrike i wanna join a viewer raid
[3:54:23] Beakz______: im only talking pvp tho who cares about pve
[3:54:24] jimihendriks: @Trodenskjold thats a smart financial desicion
[3:54:30] sepph_: @Trodenskjold OfCourse
[3:54:35] Iol69: as a horde on NA crusader, i feel almost always outnumbered by alliance
[3:54:38] H0tslice: yeah I had to make a horde character
[3:54:38] Jaeslow: yeh
[3:54:43] Jaeslow: it alternates
[3:54:45] AlphaSimply: yeah its like a 5 to 1 ratio
[3:54:45] Austyz: the server reopens at random times
[3:54:59] Mightyhal: all those bot accounts on alliance created a faction inbalance
[3:55:06] Trodenskjold: Ang dont wanna play with your dumb ass
[3:55:09] sepph_: OPAUG SALAMIhand SPEED3 DrakeWide GlueTime
[3:55:15] Jaeslow: yeh just gotta be patient and camp it to unlock
[3:55:16] AlphaSimply: bots fucked it up YEP
[3:55:16] Leeroyjenkss: @Graycen Do you think they should let you have an alliance and horde charachter on the same server
[3:55:21] kirbz2011: cant u use leatrix to speed this shit up
[3:55:25] GoodGuyEli74: ranged hunters are at the bottom for WCL glad they nerfed them within 24 hours of SoD coming out
[3:55:26] Egyptian_Joe: @AlphaSimply, no its not
[3:55:26] Nightbot: Please check out and subscribe to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/GraycenTV
[3:55:28] Dr__Pumpkin: it kinda makes me mad they are balancing around PvE. the spriest nerf won’t affect PvP much cause void plague gonna hurt even more now
[3:55:30] itz_prismo: what rep
[3:55:35] skyestormz: what time does the big time content start graycen, did I miss it?
[3:55:35] AlphaSimply: Yes it is ReallyMad

[3:56:05] AlphaSimply: not even reading that lil bro
[3:56:09] Elijahss: Horde out numbers us
[3:56:14] Austyz: nah i think if they are inactive for too long the system registers that
[3:56:16] Lifeles85: idk but I remember in the start they had so many people in the wall running around
[3:56:16] Arcsilin: yeah kinda pisses me off tha ppl just follow asmon like that and never play
[3:56:19] Egyptian_Joe: @AlphaSimply, thats expected you are too stupid
[3:56:20] Elijahss: Go to Ashenvale at night
[3:56:23] catjammespam: Ok throwing my pc out the window YEET
[3:56:24] Leeroyjenkss: but after there sub ends new ppl will come in
[3:56:24] tjzlock: they should just not include anyone in the wall as part of the faction imbalance
[3:56:26] sepph_: nope
[3:56:27] shloom995: asmon fan ruined the server
[3:56:30] Lissard: nope
[3:56:32] WingsDub: how many asmon hater accounts were made
[3:56:32] hogwarts_dropout: no one gunna do that gup
[3:56:40] AlphaSimply: i cant read Pepega not arguing with some Nerdge in Graycens chat
