[2:37:28] themanjake2020: COOKED EXTRA WELL DONE
[2:37:28] subsonic_eye: i say release on same day so the people that want to prog the raid without great gear can do so with it still being a challenge
[2:37:30] themanjake2020: WICKED
[2:37:32] Troy_G_94: Who gives a fuck about racing to gnomerang 🤣🤣🤣
[2:37:36] TheEyeVII: not anymore

[2:37:47] Zaitherion: indeed
[2:37:59] themanjake2020: Imagine being so down bad you race world first on a 20 year old game
[2:38:04] PieckuF: What will skills be increased to?
[2:38:05] Traitmark: no rush
[2:38:12] Madwo: wideMonkePls i just wanna dance
[2:38:13] Kurama__95: They do the 1 week delay on retail every patch to give ppl time to just check out new features, don't see why not do the same in Classic
[2:38:15] Traitmark: i just did BFD for first time today om
[2:38:16] bilbo_bohannans: 0 rush
[2:38:16] themanjake2020: no rush
[2:38:17] HidekiKojima: rush it LULW
[2:38:19] RudyRube: no rush

[2:38:30] wreckstormx: they they are gonna complain about nothing to do again
[2:38:33] cthreeplo: im still lvl 2
[2:38:33] sohnvomvadda: how do you spell Gnomegadron again? getting mixed signals here
[2:38:36] vahngogeta: can’t think too bricked
[2:38:43] TheEyeVII: 25>40 won't be long especially with the dung spam & the broken gear we have right now, it'll be extremely fast
[2:38:45] Norcore: i enjoy the grind but i understand where do people come from. i wouldn't mind a week delay
[2:38:49] AstralDoge: It'll prob be cleared up with a group of lvl 35 rushers, so why not just delay it?
[2:38:51] wreckstormx: then*
[2:38:52] Madwo: im still progging DM borpaWICKED
[2:38:57] themanjake2020: People just complain in WoW, you cant please them
[2:38:58] RudyRube: lvl 25-40 is actually the 2nd longest grind, longer than 40-50.  50-60 is longest of course
[2:38:59] Zaitherion: just say Gnomer
[2:39:02] Traitmark: @Madwo Skipped it, was to hard
[2:39:03] themanjake2020: yes it is
[2:39:09] Madwo: @Traitmark baserg
[2:39:10] themanjake2020: 1 week is good
[2:39:18] Staggerchad: ABOBA
[2:39:18] Norcore: yeah, i can level profs in that time
[2:39:19] mafiappc: one week is good
[2:39:21] steinis2k: have they not always done 1 week ?
[2:39:23] Cpt_Titus: content from first phase was done in 1 week tho^^ not gona be diff on 40
[2:39:25] Traitmark: iuh
[2:39:31] Kinnoli: do you think ppl will just be so geared with a 1 week wait time tho that it will make it super easy to clear
[2:39:33] aco87: well yeah no mount
[2:39:37] j0llylox: @savix imagine playing SOD at 60 and out of no where blizz is like "next phase announced" hooooly savixPraise
[2:39:37] blightweller: maybe do 3 days so you can have a good leveling time
[2:39:42] Troy_G_94: It would be nice if the casuals can get into the raid before there's 400 strategy videos on how to do it online 🤣🤣
[2:39:43] HidekiKojima: yo king, let me clean your emotes BEGGING
[2:39:47] fuzzywuzzyqt: 50-60 is the longest
[2:39:56] RudyRube: based on exp divided by per mob kill, 25-40 is longer than 40-50.  Plus, no mount
[2:39:58] TheEyeVII: what prep it's classic pve, literal joke if you're above room temp IQ
[2:39:58] Naboo69: savixOld its gonna be super easy anyway
[2:40:06] Kurama__95: om
[2:40:21] its_me_: BFD was dungeon difficulty anyways
[2:40:22] Madzbazz: Hard and classic in the same sentence om
[2:40:23] Xhimon: but sir classic is too hard peepoNerd
[2:40:28] Xhimon: but sir Classic is too hard peepoNerd
[2:40:31] Naboo69: savixOld the mechanics consist of maybe a taunt swap and a kick with dont stand in the bad
[2:40:37] TheEyeVII: true
[2:40:39] nikola420tesla: they should make a heroic mode with better gear Pog
[2:40:40] AstralDoge: I wish they tuned last bosses harder in classic
[2:40:40] HidekiKojima: yo king BEGGING let me remove all the cat emotes, I'm kidding I wont touch them fuh Fuzzy will add them back
[2:40:43] subsonic_eye: the first attempts at bfd were kinda hard for really good players that had shit gear, then it got really easy
[2:40:44] Norcore: what if we had heroic difficulty or is that a bad idea
[2:40:50] j0llylox: If they make THIS hard then THESE will be harder too
[2:40:54] Cpt_Titus: true
[2:41:01] vahngogeta: need heroic gnomer
[2:41:03] blueNovaster: @j0llylox bad bad
[2:41:03] Traitmark: just let it release immediately and give the rushers a massively overtuned raid OM om
[2:41:04] TheEyeVII: bfd is lfr level imo you basically run through it with zero knowledge
[2:41:11] Cpt_Titus: need m+ brd
[2:41:19] TheEyeVII: heroic level would kill SoD
[2:41:31] blueNovaster: oh wrong reply lol
[2:41:34] ShadyClaws_: i even bored of lived, how people doesnt bored of play wow LUL
[2:41:50] AstralDoge: Do you think we're getting SM too?
[2:41:53] steinis2k: why can't we just have hc mode on dungs but the gear dropping being the same instead so that people who wants it hard can do it hard and the ones who wants it easy can do it easy ?
[2:41:53] Madwo: guh
[2:41:55] Madwo: rogues
[2:42:00] Xhimon: yeah savix thats true. Imagine dying in HCSoD BFD 💀
[2:42:09] Naboo69: KEKW
[2:42:12] bilbo_bohannans: classic is just a cozy and chill game. all about how many buffs you want to get
[2:42:16] vahngogeta: EGO
[2:42:16] Deadge_Gartic: savix can you do this irl widetuhjam Tsk
[2:42:19] thenomadds: its the azamous vid, cant even play wsg solo

[2:42:48] subsonic_eye: 2 more world buffs
[2:42:52] Madwo: maybe the OG world buffs will be removed
[2:42:54] Madwo: fuh
[2:42:57] Houkiedoukie: yes
[2:42:57] Deadge_Gartic: tbh they should remove all the world buffs LULW
[2:43:00] themanjake2020: replace
[2:43:01] GoodGriffey: replace
[2:43:01] jtstroud: yes replace
[2:43:01] Xhimon: yes
[2:43:03] Aalee: na LETS STACK BUFFS
[2:43:03] fuzzywuzzyqt: yes
[2:43:03] Norcore: replace please pepeW
[2:43:05] andyl0l: Same buff different way to obtain please COPIUM
[2:43:06] subsonic_eye: this is what ive been wondering about
[2:43:06] Crazia: replace them for sure
[2:43:07] Naboo69: savixOld just make gnomer buff give the same buff from BFD and make the old buff only work until level 39
[2:43:08] tubbscoolguy: Replace
[2:43:11] Madwo: SCHIZO
[2:43:12] Elrom_77: BFD buff makes sense pre mount
[2:43:13] subsonic_eye: there will be 12 buffs
[2:43:14] LeBiz: Just make the same buff for all raids
[2:43:14] steinis2k: replace 100%
[2:43:15] jtstroud: replace or its stupid and we would have 5 more buff tyo get im not ever doing that
[2:43:18] AstralDoge: Remove old ones cuz it's going to be a sweaty farm otherwise lol
[2:43:19] fuzzywuzzyqt: !cbt
[2:43:19] Aalee: GIGACHAD world buff enjoyers
[2:43:20] bilbo_bohannans: god please no, too much travel to 20 second bosses
[2:43:22] Madzbazz: 15 world buffs pepeW
[2:43:23] Deadge_Gartic: tbh they should remove all the world buffs LULW 󠀀
[2:43:28] Traitmark: just give it the same stats and don't let it overlap @Savix
[2:43:32] blightweller: i would prefer only 1 pvp and 1 raid buff allowed, like being unique on gear
[2:43:33] steinis2k: maks level having like 20 wb's xD
[2:43:36] Grashh: They should keep world buffs limited to open world or to the dungeon you got it from like bfd for example
[2:43:36] Naboo69: savixOld just make gnomer buff give the same buff from BFD and make the old buff only work until level 39 󠀀
[2:43:40] themanjake2020: less
[2:43:40] Grashh: no stacking
[2:43:43] TobimaroTV: remove them all
[2:43:45] emmision: replace
[2:43:47] themanjake2020: i dont like WBs
[2:43:48] blueNovaster: no stacks
[2:43:49] Trodenskjold: replace ofcourse
[2:43:49] blightweller: so you can still choose which 1 you take
[2:43:50] Elachiko: ORRRRR NEW RAIDS THAT REQUIRE ALL 20 WBS
[2:43:52] Norcore: yeah
[2:43:53] subsonic_eye: i think gnomer buff should be same as bfd and same with stv
[2:43:55] AstralDoge: Maybe mix the world buffs into 1 with multiple turnoffs?
[2:43:56] its_me_: 1 world buff
[2:44:02] SOAGGY: just make it to where if you have 10 buffs your char is invuln  EzpZ
[2:44:04] TheEyeVII: when I see people requiring buffs or GS for bfd runs I know they're bad anyway
[2:44:10] blightweller: like 1 from p1 and the other 1 from p2
[2:44:28] Shepp22: you talking about the drums?
[2:44:29] definitely_not_sure: savix uau
[2:44:32] definitely_not_sure: Train
[2:44:40] Shepp22: the drums you can carry in your bag tho
[2:44:42] Naboo69: savixOld make it boonable or make the quest a daily quest but only rewards rep once a week
[2:44:47] cmdrfail: they should make the ashenvale buff same as the 3 days reset, its a shame to wait 1 week to get it again
[2:44:51] j0llylox: @savix do you think BFD will be closed with the new level cap or set a level cap to enter it?
[2:44:52] evilmurder1949: i just want them to make dual wield enh shaman actually good lol
[2:44:55] subsonic_eye: or u can get 2 a week maybe
[2:44:59] AstralDoge: Mixing a fair amount of the world buffs into 1 or 2 would solve the huge grind
[2:45:00] TheEyeVII: idc if low-skilled players need 10 buffs to clear lfr level sod raids, I won't require em' in my pugs is my take @Savix
[2:45:15] Naboo69: charges would be nice
[2:45:20] Shepp22: but you can carry it in your bag until you get to the raid…
[2:45:23] Byshash: you know what would be even better? removing world buffs from raids
[2:45:49] Naboo69: @Shepp22 there are 2 raids a week and 1 buff
[2:45:56] subsonic_eye: SoD is exciting because there is so much unknown never been done
[2:46:03] EdubZanji: yo savix can i link a video ?
[2:46:13] j0llylox: What if they make booning a micro transaction option only?
[2:46:50] j0llylox: savixWiggle
[2:46:50] subsonic_eye: LULW
[2:47:01] 5hourandy: yeah wahts next? a monthly sub? KEKW
[2:47:02] bogartblind: yea i was really surprised u coudlnt boon ashenvale made me Sadge
[2:47:04] amoonguss_3000: what if you get thunderfury for only $10
[2:47:12] Shepp22: it’s fun to pump, not fun to get them or die with them
[2:47:22] trmonx: a little world buff not 50 world buff
[2:47:31] Houkiedoukie: they should add a battle pass to classic wow where you get a chronoboon displacer every 5 levels and then when you reach level 100 on the wow classic battle pass you'll get a free boon every level
[2:47:40] amoonguss_3000: they should add a battle pass to classic wow where you get a chronoboon displacer every 5 levels and then when you reach level 100 on the wow classic battle pass you'll get a free boon every level
[2:47:52] Houkiedoukie: LUL
[2:47:54] Naboo69: more damage = peepoHappy less damage = Sadge
[2:48:00] subsonic_eye: i like it when its manageable, when people require all then for 40 mans its rough
[2:48:10] fuzzywuzzyqt: I think world buffs need to go
[2:48:11] fuzzywuzzyqt: imo
[2:48:19] bilbo_bohannans: #murloc dance death
[2:48:29] shinra40: they went in season of mastery ppl hated it
[2:48:32] TheEyeVII: sod is not meant to have a future tho, it's meant to be a sub retention for classic-only players bored with HC or som imo
[2:48:34] andyl0l: You mean flame the tank
[2:48:38] fuzzywuzzyqt: I'm well aware lol
[2:48:43] AstralDoge: People were doing the quillboar quests for more buffs, so I think they'll be fine, just make the raid to not need them or limit the amount you can have.
[2:48:47] bennihanah: reeburr barr behm burr bee
[2:49:08] vegancatsalad: world buffs make the game more fun, full stop, why would you remove fun
[2:49:17] Norcore: i like the aspect of getting rewarded for putting in effort, but when they stack the buffs too much it's just annoying
[2:49:20] trmonx: just remove ashenvale buff
[2:49:25] andyl0l: It's ok I'm the tank
[2:49:40] Madwo: guh
[2:49:41] shinra40: bean just pulls earlt oh wait that s kaizer om
[2:49:50] fuzzywuzzyqt: Hold on
[2:49:51] Spazzytuna: could I see your talents Mr. Vix?
[2:49:54] TheEyeVII: classic parsers have to be the saddest bunch of people i've seen in wow ngl, that's similar to bragging about a middleschool diploma LUL
[2:49:55] fuzzywuzzyqt: I'm having an issue
[2:49:57] fuzzywuzzyqt: says I'm offline

[2:50:37] clowntastik: my mail got layered
[2:50:44] vegancatsalad: @Savix thoughts on Gnomer being 10 man?
[2:50:48] juicebarspecial: dude last hit on an elite quest mob and i've layered ... or we got 3/5 to summon and the SECOND we go to summon we got layered...
[2:50:50] KroocsMD: that layer during world pvp at the wetlands bridge om

[2:51:11] Zaitherion: totally
[2:51:13] Naboo69: savixOld real and true
[2:51:14] radiorahem: randomly getting layered into a losing Ashenvale made me logged
[2:51:17] evilmurder1949: layering in general kind of sucks
[2:51:28] TheEyeVII: they won't remove layering doesn't really matter
[2:51:28] jb_eitht: we goin for warr rune? PauseChamp ?
[2:51:35] cthreeplo: its like getting a bj then feeling an adams apple
[2:51:39] hugemuscles__: we need gigavix rule 34. if you are an artist DM me I will pay well
[2:51:41] andyl0l: Though it was like 2am so I guess one layer just got "turned off"

[2:52:15] geminuspr: Tried to help a fr with a rune and we couldnt layer together at like 2 am guzuUGHN guzuUGHN guzuUGHN
[2:52:17] radiorahem: should major cities layer you while in a party ? it happens all the time to me
[2:52:21] mafiappc: tuh
[2:52:23] bilbo_bohannans: dont remember the issues in tbc, wotlk or HC
[2:52:25] Cpt_Titus: the sharding/layering is fucked
[2:52:28] shinra40: you didnt play hardcore on farlina
[2:52:37] subsonic_eye: the random layering is a bug or an emergency thing i guess, it sux they need to fix that
[2:52:39] bodadieda: Heard they did that so the pvp event is more populated
[2:53:00] exstas1234: I got randomly layered at the end of an escort quest and it failed
[2:53:09] m3nkind: It is legit what is happening rightr now in our group
[2:53:20] radiorahem: tbh Ashenvale event isn’t even PvP
[2:53:24] andyl0l: Yep been there as well lmao
[2:53:26] WhySoSandy: that happened to me too!
[2:53:48] Shepp22: got layered randomly from a winning ashenvale to a horrible loss
[2:53:53] mafiappc: @exstas1234 om
[2:53:53] Shepp22: it’s so random
[2:54:17] johncrouton44: stv ptsd :(
[2:55:01] LeBiz: bigger reward for HK during event, ppl only care about tagging the boss then run to the next one
[2:55:07] Madwo: fuh
[2:55:09] TheEyeVII: it's a pve world event it's not pvp at all aside for the 40vs1 on the road
[2:55:13] Naboo69: payoOld the secret tech darkmoon canon escape
[2:55:22] balithos: i wish each each eset gnomer has 7 different bosses?
[2:55:25] Uogien: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmPA3BGlCo4  imNOTcrying
[2:55:25] subsonic_eye: funnel the faction into each other somehow
[2:55:29] exstas1234: Maybe an item to port you to your HQ to defend like in Alterac Valley
[2:55:30] juicebarspecial: we got layered mid summons for bfd into getting camped by 2 horde raids and hour raid ended up being an hour late
[2:55:31] Madwo: monkS
[2:55:36] hugemuscles__: add the double arm twisty technique in STV PvP :)
[2:55:39] killerbees_tv: supplu drop would be fun
[2:55:42] Traitmark: what if STV PVP Buffs random (max lvl) players in the zone and you gotta protect them or kill others.... atleast it means people will have to attack others
[2:55:42] Norcore: that would be sick
[2:55:54] trmonx: inv to farm layer lol
[2:56:23] jb_eitht: PauseChamp
[2:56:24] TheEyeVII: the layers being random are def an implementation to make ashenvale more active on more layers, right? would explain it
[2:56:57] jb_eitht: do u think we will have arathi basin pvp event p2?
[2:57:11] bilbo_bohannans: layer pain sadge
[2:57:20] jb_eitht: om

[5:02:01] fallendarkone220: SoD mythic plus dungeons calling it right now
[5:02:34] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic It's why I'm playing arms on my warrior tbh, Fury just doesn't look fun in S3. I had like 4 days of Tindral prog in total before nerf, it was pain, but after nerf ppl seem to think it'll be much easier

[5:03:31] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic I think we're mid patch, HoF is not even closed yet. Also, if you plan on playing S4 and they do the same as they did with the Sylv bow, you'll be able to use a Dinar to get the leggo up to S4 ilvl, so it won't be wasted
