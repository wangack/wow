[0:24:32] Molvonos: Devoker's all about setting records.  Records on how quickly you can rip aggro before the tank can get enough threat.
[0:25:13] Dagomarus: Thats why you flap away as soon as you have ripped aggro LUL
[0:25:16] mewkittymon: I find I hold it quit well off them hehe

[3:28:48] visaeris412: @Mecabeast dont really think you can compare because vault came out with an entire expansion essentially
[3:29:30] king_julian_96: my guestion is since according to the dungeon hournal that none of the 3 primal incarnates that escaped at the end of vault are raid bosses when are we going to kill them
[3:29:47] Sykum: gonna see a few more troll priests
[3:30:09] NVbrutal: october 14th was last day of testing for vault i think

[5:21:47] Tooyoo: the only improvment is that you can upgrade normal / heroic raid gear doing M+
[5:22:19] Tooyoo: Yeah, still have to play the game to get upgrades.
[5:22:26] Steelsky_: didnt they say you could upgrade outdoor gear like trinkets?
[5:22:42] dreamwalker213: I always been of the belief you should have to do the highest content do get the highest gear
[5:22:46] t1mbstone: Warcraft 3 music towNut3  thank you for this
[5:22:47] vhaal97: I’m surprised you don’t have more characters.
[5:23:23] Tooyoo: @dreamwalker213 that is still the case. You can't upgrade gear without doing HIGHER level M+. You cant spam +2's and upgrade gear.
[5:23:31] t1mbstone: SO many wow, what's this area ?
[5:23:39] faulen: is this 10.1 area or the 10.07 area?

[5:25:45] Steelsky_: Man I wanna play priest just for that mog, looks dope on all colors
[5:25:49] dreamwalker213: @tooyoo I know that’s the case now. But I like the idea of having to do higher keys all the time to upgrade instead of hitting 2400 then just spamming 2s

[5:27:51] Tooyoo: @dreamwalker213 You can't do that though. You still need to get a crest per item.
[5:27:57] Foretoldlegends: So I transferred a character from live to PTR and for some reason, it says I have negative dragon glyphs.
[5:28:13] Tooyoo: So it actually is more "higher level" spamming than the current 2400 rating system.
[5:28:30] Malphasdub: donkey teeth
[5:28:54] thecynicalshuffler: flowfy? is that supposed to be like fluffy?   lol
