[2:38:46] abs1830: Reroll Prot warrior inc?
[2:39:01] fistofnature: those dragons are really annoying

[2:40:49] Oldduketree007: only mobs befor last boss*
[2:40:56] jacefullness: I feel Jade temple might be the most balanced dungeon atm.
[2:41:14] WaverlyP15: for the same reason that peole refuse to move
[2:41:14] warrenny: @kelticlore Single boss m+? Wouldnt work
[2:41:18] Oldduketree007: hm Jade feelt cramped at 16
[2:42:09] DavisFacts: hello mr towelle
[2:42:28] jacefullness: Yeah, but Jade has no real unavoidable one shots etc. If you kick well, and tanks have mitigation for tank busters it's a pretty devent key. It's not easy, it's not hard.
[2:43:11] abs1830: too much stun resist too
[2:43:58] toocheap2rhyme: omnicd is what youre looking for

[2:45:14] shredcruuzz: court of stars has been a terrible experience for me so far. tanks chain pulling or over-pulling and the group runs out of kicks for all the different cc
[2:45:16] jacefullness: @Oldduketree007 Everything except the circle is avoidable on that one though. Requires coordinated kicks however, a bit like medivh but easier.

[2:47:16] jacefullness: @Oldduketree007 Someone I learned last week is that the water pulses 3 times before it blows up. So if you count them, and make sure to stand on stone when it blows you take a lot less damage
[2:47:17] DisparagingTurtle: I got yelled at when i was tanking a lower key cause the dps were in narnia causing the add to spawn across the entire arena eabSHRUG sorry let me control where the adds spawn next time i guess
