[1:35:24] Brauner0910: dont fotget abouzt br always nice to have
[1:35:48] Faeynna: Like on higher tyra on this boss,  you want to ignore the totem, so a bubble taunt is really good to let the tank survive it

[1:36:17] Berrasw3: do you also remember what you were gonna do after this key?
[1:36:26] Berrasw3: yes :D
[1:36:37] Faeynna: You want to focus down the boss as fast as possible. Killing the totem takes to long time and just increases the risk of tank death
[1:37:14] Faeynna: When the totem is active, the boss hit's insanely hard.
[1:37:44] Faeynna: But a good tank with overlapping cds and externals can survive it long enough for him to phase

[2:49:32] P_and_A: I thought they added the function of account wide ignore many years ago :o
[2:49:36] TheFernandeez: Sometimes I wonder if blizzard ever read tickets
[2:49:47] kelly_mac06: it's a shame you can just send in twitch clips of them doing this shit
[2:49:53] Laturi1212: you could try the addon "global ignore list" - it has the function of accountwide ignore
[2:49:59] Krohnk: So typical ppl with low selfesteem to behave like that. Very sad person. It's wierd actions like this is not handled asap. If i say somthing like "how stupid are you" in bg chatt i get insta silenced for a week..
[2:50:01] Benantao: who is?

[2:51:42] Noobaroni: he's no doubt getting off on you reacting to it on stream
[2:51:44] chimmyshu: they will prob just suspend him for couple days. I'd be positivelu surprised if thery'd ban him for long time
[2:51:53] dusttiy: it should 100% be an account ignore not only a character ignore
[2:51:57] EmanuShow: Good game mechanics ignore shouldnt be able to reach you in any sort of manner
[2:52:22] Krohnk: <3
[2:52:57] Berrasw3: yeah it fucking sux.. and clearly shows how little blizzard cares about their players
[2:53:04] kalfjaell1: so sad when people even want to go on like this. have fun and respect each other and have fun, don't understand why it should be so hard to actually just be nice :)
[2:53:12] EmanuShow: He probably on stream listening so he knows when you go online
[2:53:46] EmanuShow: Can only ignore so much
[2:53:59] balnafettack: I've had similar problem. Blizzard does nothing with reports. i no longer play wow.. sorry this does not help your situation. but letting you know that Blizzard are very poor at dealing with this

[3:13:15] EmanuShow: Look up original latin translation for respect and learn
[3:13:31] Faeynna: Best not to comment other peoples eating habits, or how they look. Never know what that person has been going through.
[3:13:48] xaphrodite_x: @Faeynna Exactly this!!!
[3:14:09] EmanuShow: Best not to comment on other peoples life at all, we all kings and queens of our castle^^

[3:14:51] Lugosiqt: @EmanuShow I agree with this, unless they're leading very unhealthy habits, positive influence is never a bad thing but unsolicited advise can be :P
[3:15:28] Faeynna: @Lugosiqt But what is unhealthy habits? Sure, doing drugs might not be the best choices.
[3:15:39] EmanuShow: No matter people have high enough iq to make descisions for themselves and learn from own consequences
[3:15:51] StreamElements: My current playlist is: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5yfpG2DjHPthKZwAbD8tYE
[3:16:09] EmanuShow: Let me rephrase that all adult lives
[3:16:49] EmanuShow: If you cant learn from your consequences you wont be considered legally adult in sweden
[3:16:49] jeenniiffeerr94: oh whats happening here D:
[3:17:52] mathund1111: we've been educated by various chatmember that the best way to respect people is to not pay attention to their problems
[3:18:11] EmanuShow: So let all learn from their own consequences, let proffessional shrinks deal with rest
[3:18:21] Lugosiqt: @Faeynna I can think of a whole hooost of things, one example being a friend drinking nothing but energy drinks, I'd advise to drink some fuckin water lol
[3:19:07] bsg_wiz: hey snow how u like ret so far? also what pve content u doin?
[3:19:21] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[3:19:51] Faeynna: @Lugosiqt aye sure. I was just being on defense there. Because I've been struggling with ED. (Could go days without eating at all). And then I could eat like half a pizza or something, and someone asked "Is Pizza really the best choice?"
[3:20:21] StreamElements: Don't forget to check out my new video https://youtu.be/2tEMjiRCgiQ
[3:20:22] Faeynna: It's like, yes. Because the other option would be starvation and death.

[3:21:02] Lugosiqt: @Faeynna of course - people may say things without ill intent, as long as they want the best for you and you can have an open discussion about how it makes you feel, thats the important bit imo
[3:21:29] Lugosiqt: but what do I know! (fuck all!)
[3:21:53] Faeynna: Yea.. but for someone that struggling with it. Even getting that question is triggering. So it's better not to ask at all.
[3:22:04] Faeynna: Unless the person ask.
[3:22:09] Grohma_: i dont get the whole Point on commenting or advising on other ppl lifestyle at all. i mean it is not your Problem/life, nor do you have to deal with any possible consequences.
[3:22:13] EmanuShow: Medling with others life is not the adult way either
[3:22:26] Lugosiqt: @Grohma_ some people want the best for others suffering.
[3:22:54] Lugosiqt: I wouldn't say giving advise to loved ones and having an open chat about stuff is "medling" but hey ho
[3:23:23] Grohma_: @lugosiqt even if you mean helping, some ppl dont want your advice or Are able to take it at the Moment
[3:23:28] EmanuShow: What you consider advice to mean in english dictionary?
[3:23:46] Locke3796: ah this is the churchkids
[3:23:51] Lugosiqt: @EmanuShow "offer suggestions about the best course of action to someone."
[3:24:00] EmanuShow: If i want advice i see a proffessional
[3:24:21] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[3:24:22] EmanuShow: How you offer suggestion without medling?
[3:24:26] Lugosiqt: @EmanuShow you would need a Dr to tell you that terrible eating habits are unhealthy?#

[3:27:14] Lugosiqt: @EmanuShow absolutely don't agree,
[3:27:20] EmanuShow: Leave it to the proffessionals?

[3:31:13] EmanuShow: Was talking about the one doing spam invites lugo

[3:31:55] EmanuShow: Its a bit of judgement yes but he meddling with others life he needs to stop it
[3:32:07] Faeynna: @Crille3 they should just add "Only allow invites and whispers from people on friendlist"
[3:32:27] iivan321: im new here, does that guy rly spend 4-8 hours a day doing this? what
[3:32:31] Crille3: What they should do is after you blockt someone in game it is cross all their chars
