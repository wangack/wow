[0:25:16] Tonyromoisreal: thats not everything
[0:25:18] Tonyromoisreal: not even close
[0:25:37] astranna: It's broken up into many articles
[0:25:43] Mokilok22: just gotta scroll thru wowhead

[0:31:57] Omypulls: make sure to check out the sod talent calculator on wow head. it shows helmet runes and more! https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc
[0:32:41] samaxis: @Omypulls wait until after seeing the official stuff, all the rest might not be real.
[0:32:46] TOINOUZEUBI: I don’t know I feel watching sod stream sucks arena still better to watch to my opinion
[0:34:26] Nerfed4U: how can they possibly police gdkp effectively thouigh
[0:34:29] Omypulls: @samaxis hmm, I don’t think so bro. don’t see why they wouldn’t give use those runes??? hope they do though haha. UA and Fel Guard sound soooo nice haha
[0:34:39] Inzio: @snutzy ik you're making a shadow priest after seeing the runes lol
[0:34:42] inspect4: no way why would they remove chest
[0:35:04] samaxis: @Omypulls my guy, some of those runes that got datamined already exist as another rune or are for abilities classes dont learn until 50+
[0:35:24] inspect4: @nerfed4u u will get perma banned for it, no1 will spam that shit in wow chat
[0:35:26] Radonn_: wasnt the whole point of sod that theres no datamining and everythings fresh lol
[0:35:27] samaxis: @snutzy we dont know some people only got 2 more slots
[0:35:39] pipxsqueak: belt/feet for p2
[0:35:52] NeVolent: if belt feet p2 locks are fucked
[0:35:52] pipxsqueak: i think
[0:36:03] NeVolent: hope for 3
[0:36:12] samaxis: pretty sure its only 2 slots
[0:36:15] Omypulls: yes!!
[0:36:17] Flaberz: where u go vegas?

[0:40:35] Nerfed4U: i hope
[0:40:41] itbeHootie: mobility creep inc RIP
[0:40:43] samaxis: I dont think so, not with the other shadowstep already
[0:40:50] kreoxlol: when phase 2 go out?
[0:40:54] itsTazhe: surely this is just gunna feel like a wrath server capped at 60 eventually
[0:41:09] kreoxlol: thanks sir have a good stream
[0:41:20] DerpTDG: bro it's literally just wrath
[0:41:22] DerpTDG: OMEGALUL
[0:41:32] samaxis: The biggest reason I think its fake is the final line of the ability
[0:41:52] samaxis: plus we already have it
[0:42:19] Roseqt: Snutz thinking 10 years ahead
[0:42:24] inspect4: @samaxis shadowstrike is trash
[0:42:30] inyoface009: everyone said u quit streaming man !!! nice to see you back
[0:42:31] Omypulls: if so, maybe we will get demonic portal haha
[0:42:32] DerpTDG: ele is gonna be nasty
[0:42:48] shootinmyshot22: mutilate is 40 energy now… insane
[0:42:54] r_kramerz: are we getting all the rune slots unlocked is that confirmed? I thought it was only wrists and feet

[0:43:07] samaxis: @inspect4 Ok, but it exists. If they wanted shadowstep they would replace shadowstrik and not have 2 abilities that do the same thing but one is just better at everything
[0:43:08] inyoface009: best wow player ever bro
[0:43:17] Cdenzy: How was the AVNs

[0:44:52] PuffnTuff: LUL
[0:45:01] PuffnTuff: it was worth a shot.
[0:45:17] inspect4: @samaxis wouldnt be first or last time
[0:45:19] pitzprod: yep
[0:45:52] DerpTDG: PepeLa
[0:45:53] inyoface009: i feel like shaman have the worst rune by far
[0:46:05] inyoface009: im tanking shaman and im really sad for p2
[0:46:10] samaxis: just saying I dont believe shadowstep, probably a hod over. If I am wrong I am wrong but it wouldnt make sense
[0:46:15] samaxis: hold*
[0:46:22] delirious555: Is it a snare? It doesn't mention a slow?
[0:46:37] DerpTDG: not a snare

[0:59:21] TheBarehand: i like that they're making BFD give a lot of XP so it's still worth doing while leveling.
[1:00:17] danparsonss: what profs you gonna run?
[1:00:18] glory_time: gotta kill the twinks early
[1:00:26] Ryett: ok bro, how willl locks be in pahse 2?
[1:00:46] TheBarehand: ya a lot of cool changes, they just updated loot in SM, RFK etc. so it's worth getting too
[1:00:50] glory_time: i went back to Era, pumping BWL and Naxx. We down bad fam.

[1:05:15] TheBarehand: a lot of people are stacking the higher zone waylaid supplies too
[1:05:24] Ryett: snutz youre really slipping with youre lock knowledge, must be how much time you have spent at fansly, you do realize that our dots now can be refreshed at 6 seconds for a tick of damage. How is that not S++
[1:05:36] glory_time: @paxz07 pax you got a pally on alli to carry me to 4k rq?

[1:16:55] Zeroflex1: I gotta decide what to play first next phase man, I always have trouble
[1:17:07] Zeroflex1: it was gonna be pally for sure, but the runes are underwhelming
[1:17:13] Zeroflex1: well rogue is an option too
[1:17:25] syntackx: snutz on retail i recently started going from clicking to using mouse wheel for targeting and wow what a diff
[1:17:28] danparsonss: shadowstep
[1:17:28] tgrad_21: im in the same boat
[1:17:29] danparsonss: gg

[1:17:48] glory_time: i think horde was champ this phase. I think alliance SHOULD take control of P2 w/ more pally runes and mana
[1:18:07] danparsonss: did u see the helm rune? honor among thieves ?
[1:18:12] danparsonss: that is insane
[1:18:18] Ryett: is this a decent buff ?
[1:18:20] Zeroflex1: nah, never sent it
[1:18:21] Ryett: Engrave Belt - Invocation  Engrave your belt with the Invocation rune:  Refreshing Corruption, Immolate, Curse of Agony, or Siphon Life when it has less than 6 seconds duration remaining will cause you to deal instant damage to the target equal to one period of that spell's periodic damage.the spell's remaining periodic damage.
[1:18:36] Ryett: looks beeter

[1:19:26] Zeroflex1: dual wield was annoying to get
[1:19:30] Zeroflex1: its just a gold sink
[1:19:35] Zeroflex1: yeayh
[1:20:22] fanniclap: Wpvp. that's it
[1:20:26] NoPressureTV: Hey @snutzy how are you man?
[1:20:27] Libertas09: Playing PalWorld and Enshrouded ha
[1:20:29] Zeroflex1: Alts, I have a bis pally and rogue, geared enhance and 25 boomy lol
[1:20:31] fanniclap: I still find it fun idk
[1:20:33] fanniclap: lol
[1:20:37] Flaberz: fkin with rogue?
[1:20:43] EmpurityTV: just did my wsg grind
[1:20:51] Roundhere_: enshrouded looks like valheim but cooler
[1:20:52] Libertas09: Its like Valheim as a true adventure RPG
[1:21:16] Zeroflex1: The question is - do we go combat mutilate or assa mutilate? 50% offhand dmg on mutilate with dual wield spec seems nasty
[1:21:25] Zeroflex1: plus imp backstab effects mutilate
[1:21:27] Ryett: im playing diablo 4 and liking it
[1:21:30] soaXP: which class to main p2 ?
[1:22:17] Zeroflex1: mutilate with blade flurry and adrena rush
[1:22:19] Zeroflex1: insanity
[1:22:26] Ryett: do you think mage will be good?
[1:22:45] lastad94: what do u think about boomy and feral in p2 ?
[1:22:52] Ryett: ok lock is my main, but my alt is a mage
[1:23:02] proto1953: S priest is going to be scary
[1:23:02] Zeroflex1: feral is gonna be filthy
[1:23:09] Flaberz: standard mut with full dps runes kinda boring imo
[1:23:18] ashhka02: Im thinking the warrior stuff is kinda lame. What do you think?
[1:23:25] Zeroflex1: brb
[1:23:36] delirious555: Do you think rogues should get cloak?
[1:24:06] Flaberz: yea i think its backstab prep for me
[1:24:24] tgrad_21: @Flaberz this is what i was thinking
[1:24:39] mondegreen617: is warrior easier to play in pvp than rogue? thinking of rerolling
[1:24:44] Nadez: Nadez subscribed with Prime. 
[1:24:47] lastad94: im torn between rogue and druid.. what wouild you suggest ?
[1:24:52] glory_time: i just read all the changes. Consumed by Rage for warriors getting nerfed sucks, but also I dont really like playing see-saw with rage lol
[1:24:58] fanniclap: I never played BS until SoD and I can't lie positioning was a learning curve.
[1:25:47] lastad94: so u think rogue is better bet than druid ?
[1:26:13] Flaberz: sl haunt drain can u die on lock
[1:26:37] pikaseul_: thoughts on trap launcher for hunter
[1:26:53] Ryett: so you think 1v1 we fall hard? Hydra said locks are b tier cause aff is too squishy , and demo does dick damage
[1:28:02] Deneezy: well locks were pretty good @25 no king rules forever
[1:28:09] Ryett: but you say 50 or 60 they will bounce back?
[1:28:43] Neggs15: hunters having two traps down with entrapment ughhhh
[1:28:47] Ryett: sweet swwet soul link
[1:31:43] TheBarehand: u see all the items and reworked gear from sm and rfk

[1:36:33] fanniclap: rogue game changer lol
[1:37:13] dj_efx: i think it would be dope if they put in an stv kills leaderboard
[1:37:37] dj_efx: a leaderboard would make more people participate
[1:37:37] TheBarehand: They also added a raptor and tiger mount both factions can get
[1:37:52] deltrexx: warlocks ):

[1:59:33] Steveleeb: deep freeze at lv 50 seems reasonable too
[1:59:47] gianni_gsp: @snutzy did you ever consider competing for AWC again considering the prize pool or is it still poorish ROI wise?
[1:59:48] Steveleeb: displacement seems like a troll. That would be ridiculous in classic
