[0:09:57] micheladaw: personal loot seems better for pugs idk why they changed it
[0:11:15] micheladaw: yeh I'm not sure how it maths out but it feels awful to have people roll need on stuff they don't need
[0:13:14] micheladaw: I like it
[0:13:40] gellyy: surely enough jb enjoyers to kill tindral
[0:14:16] DogShitPaladin: you have a homie clear UP to tindral on a character
[0:14:26] DogShitPaladin: yes
[0:14:29] DogShitPaladin: it would work like that
[0:14:32] DogShitPaladin: as long as your lead
[0:14:36] DogShitPaladin: or the character with the lockout is lead
[0:14:52] micheladaw: don't you have the skip?
[0:14:54] DogShitPaladin: no
[0:14:58] DogShitPaladin: youd need to kill all of them or
[0:15:00] DogShitPaladin: have the skip
[0:15:05] gellyy: you still need to kill 3 bosses with the skip
[0:15:39] DogShitPaladin: get someone to save a lackout with you this time
[0:15:54] DogShitPaladin: have him make the group for you and then log off that char
[0:15:54] gellyy: yeah
[0:16:04] DogShitPaladin: you could keep re using a lockout like that
[0:16:40] DogShitPaladin: this is how people farm invincible
[0:16:50] DogShitPaladin: they clear up to lich king on a character
[0:17:09] DogShitPaladin: and re use the lockout to kill LK

[0:59:30] LogikHQ: thanks
[0:59:33] ren0m: How big of a priority is Efflorescence? I watched some of my keys and I noticed that I don't have 100% uptime since the group constantly moves.
[0:59:38] antonwnw: im so scared of healing this boss as monk, dont even know how to do it between cds, the dmg output is constant
[0:59:44] ren0m: Should I focus on it much more?
[1:00:33] iMuru: how long was the bossfight?
[1:00:46] treavorthenusance: hes like short 5% overall dmg. that must be annoying
[1:01:18] shamanticsx: Is that a wa that shows class color in lfg?

[1:16:02] ratExterminatorDevie: you're like really good it's weird that you don't have a group
[1:16:32] dragona92: @ratExterminatorDevie People still perceive JB as a rager like it's 1994 or smth FeelsWeirdMan

[1:16:43] ratExterminatorDevie: yeah that's cringe if it's true
[1:17:10] ratExterminatorDevie: and it wasn't like you committed a war crime by raging once a blue moon
[1:17:14] ratExterminatorDevie: it happens
[1:17:29] nash25pl: maybe its time for @jdotb to join esport team like method or echo ?
[1:17:53] nash25pl: tree too good on 2nd and 3rd boss
[1:18:02] Shkafche: this is the tree dungeon if there is one for defensives imo
[1:18:02] dragona92: I feel like they take you way more serious raging than others that get into groups tho... Dunno if it's cuz beard or hair or smth KEKW
[1:18:32] nash25pl: you can also proc tree threw swiftmends if u want to
[1:19:46] treavorthenusance: its nature damage
[1:24:14] bananomon_: hey JB, what you think would make dps DK be meta?
[1:25:01] sw0ngs: @bananomon_ utility
[1:25:54] dragona92: @bananomon_ Utility is never the right answer... THe right answer is always DAMAGE and more DAMAGE than anyone else
[1:26:11] dragona92: If u have dam - they will find a way to play around your utility
[1:26:41] Morayeden: One thing to help dk, get rid of the mandatory Death and Decay gameplay
[1:28:04] sw0ngs: @dragona92 yea but blizz won't go and do that

[1:31:24] dragona92: @sw0ngs Eh, IDK... Unholy used to be pretty strong in massive pull situations like MDI... I think they still are. Problem is that MDI type of situations rarely happen in live keys so it's hard to stand out
[1:31:28] ren0m: Having 5 min boss fights doesn't sound fun
[1:33:45] dragona92: @ren0m Wait until u see the last boss in this dungeon KEKW
[1:33:48] dragona92: That's close to 6
[1:34:46] ren0m: I'll go make some coffee when it starts
[1:34:51] ren0m: And I'll probably catch the kill
[1:35:07] dragona92: YEP
[1:35:27] ren0m: The lyrics really speak to me
[1:40:29] Robbielee1991: Look at this guys face. You can really see how much fun he's having

[1:44:34] Lenietwitch: butt

[1:47:21] EmElw: im amazed the grip didnt insta freeze you
[1:47:42] dragona92: That's a lot of split second decisions

[1:47:56] EmElw: counterplay was better setup ofc
[1:48:19] EmElw: checkmate like 3s before death
[1:48:21] dragona92: I wish I could clip all those situations at once
[1:48:41] dragona92: Most likely yeah
[1:49:07] ren0m: I wondered today, do people not use nitro boosts?
[1:49:15] EmElw: shares pot cd, generally no
[1:49:30] dragona92: 330k or smth
[1:49:30] tabxzer: you like tranquility now?

[1:50:07] EmElw: still pretty good, especially on tanks
[1:50:40] ren0m: !addons
[1:51:04] dragona92: I also genuinely wonder how u recovered from the stun on a 28 tyran KEKW
[1:53:13] ren0m: !commands
[1:53:17] ren0m: I give up
[1:53:32] Ckraigfriend: will you get that rise key this week
[1:53:43] zNzUV: dude how do u guys yesterday put nokud in B tier sadge
[1:53:43] Deagen: Tyrstone works well bound with using Flourish I've found.
[1:53:46] ren0m: Can you tell then please if you're using Big wigs or DBM
[1:53:53] ren0m: Or something else?
[1:54:49] waelrick: LUL  󠀀

[1:55:26] Whitewolf1441: jb, loved you in the m+ discussion yesterday, wish you would do more of those, you have such a podcasty voice
[1:55:36] Lenietwitch: i was watching here when that happens and now she not going bear form is a chat meme xD
[1:55:46] tabxzer: @jdotb That build you playing looks interesting, do you only play it in everbloom? Could be good in high falls keys too no?
[1:56:25] ren0m: Thank you
[1:57:03] Whitewolf1441: sick
[1:57:55] Whitewolf1441: arent they trying their hardest to make buffs and debuffs unweakaurable?
[1:58:02] ren0m: affix that turns off all WAs?
[1:58:05] Whitewolf1441: I remember something like that in the world first race on fyrrak
[1:58:09] ren0m: That would be something
[1:58:22] Iqqo: now i got all 3 fyrakk trinkets from hc ( myth ) lvl hc tindrall and 489tyrstone
[1:58:30] Iqqo: not stepping my foot inside that raid again

[2:03:31] Whitewolf1441: lol are you serious? cus i feel rising with the sun is natural
[2:03:35] Whitewolf1441: do you actually think its bad?
[2:03:38] ren0m: Like they want to make it as miserable as possible
[2:03:45] FuruF: Yeah, I lived in Chattanooga a few years ago and it blew my mind how early the school buses picked up kids.
[2:04:25] ren0m: At least you'll let us know if its good LUL
[2:04:40] tabxzer: @Whitewolf1441 We are all wired differently, which is good and actually make sense from an evolution perspective that some people likes to stay up at night and some people like to go up early, so the flock is protected from danger.
[2:05:09] AstralKiwi0292: sunrise in Dublin Ireland is 8:11am today
[2:05:13] ren0m: Wake up at 5 into a -15C weather
[2:05:20] tabxzer: if everyone as wired same, we as a spiecies would be dead prob since everyone was asleep when the big bad wolf attacked
[2:05:40] dragona92: @tabxzer Prayge
[2:06:40] WytherOK: it will improve your experience, which in turn will improve your mood while streaming
[2:06:49] Calair_: we'll see the better colors in your glasses reflection, big gains for us
[2:06:52] buzwiteyer: hypothetically if you’re having more fun the stream will improve
[2:06:59] ren0m: We'll get to know if its worth buying
[2:08:06] ren0m: People are still working
[2:08:08] ren0m: Or in school
[2:08:29] yesman297: U will be disapointed
[2:09:16] dragona92: @buzwiteyer ^ This
[2:09:54] Whitewolf1441: so why are you buying it
[2:10:23] WytherOK: I learned that with high end headphones

[2:13:18] Kingcoconutcrab: ideal coffee-getting moments
[2:13:22] the_pyke: supposedly ... ok i like LED :D
[2:13:24] ren0m: Similar thing than going above 60HZ or getting a mechanical keyboard
[2:14:07] dragona92: Mechanical keyboard so much better, I agree, but cleaning it - u do need to do it way more often FeelsBadMan
[2:14:38] ren0m: True
[2:14:40] Whitewolf1441: didnt know you were a tech nerd
[2:14:43] ren0m: But they're great
[2:15:03] camshreds: far too early for experiential graph

[2:15:45] Kingcoconutcrab: with static images, the old ones did still have burn in if you play 10-12 hours a day :p (degen)
[2:15:51] dragona92: @Shinishi Really? PepeHands
[2:16:21] Shinishi: yes, where my WA's playerframe, details are mostly, so all the static things in wow
[2:16:53] Shinishi: not rly noticable until i fullscren some static color on my screen

[2:19:15] WytherOK: it also covers all appliances delivery and setup
[2:19:40] WytherOK: *shrug*
[2:19:54] Kingcoconutcrab: the "I didn't know"-card doesn't tend to work
[2:19:56] WytherOK: or I can buy it and ship it to you
[2:20:13] dragona92: @soul2250 It says 57'' when I google it monkaS
[2:20:22] FuruF: Just say you have a kid in college in Chattanooga :)
[2:20:35] WytherOK: @FuruF the truth here

[2:22:50] Kingcoconutcrab: D4 will own after 1.5 years :p
[2:23:00] ren0m: I mean there was a huge hype around it, and now no one talks about it anymore.
[2:23:01] WytherOK: Whitewolf1441 you get that a lot when a streamer plays a game they don't enjoy, I think he still enjoys wow
[2:23:27] Whitewolf1441: @WytherOK good point, some streamers chase the popular games regardless

[2:30:46] Xastin3: taylor thing is fine
[2:30:54] koala_715: People just like to hate on her. She doesn't even like the coverage they put on her lol.
[2:30:55] xilyx2: she gives them access to a demographic they would never reach
[2:30:56] pizzatimefrank: Taylor swift is just an easy target to bitch about.
[2:30:57] caradea_: why does that matter
[2:31:01] zebracak35: liek if you're getting your feathers ruffled because of 28 seconds over 5 hours you need to garble some bleach
[2:31:07] the_pyke: we see here more often
[2:31:17] MrChillGates: Don't act like none of you have listened and liked a T-swift song
[2:31:20] xilyx2: its gonna go nuts
[2:31:24] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:31:24] Whitewolf1441: didnt know she was that popular
[2:31:24] xilyx2: i wonder what ad space is going for
[2:31:28] Guffels: i swear every time travis scored it goes straight to their booth. just very funny to me
[2:31:32] koala_715: I heard something like chiefs made like 300 million more in merch than last year... so yeah i'm sure the chiefs love it
[2:31:39] xilyx2: bro shes like #1
[2:31:40] zebracak35: taylor swift is a billionaire due to her music
[2:31:40] Xastin3: i dont think taylor going to be at superbowl. she has concert in tokyo the night before
[2:31:43] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: her tour made like a billion dollars
[2:31:48] numberseal: @jdotb What class would you says is the best healing class to start out with as a person who hasn't healed since TBC ???
[2:31:48] Whitewolf1441: ?? a cult?
[2:32:09] zebracak35: shes this generations michael jackson
[2:32:15] koala_715: I saw her show in Chicago, it was absolutely the best show I've ever seen. Not even close.
[2:32:15] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: imagine if she militarized her fans and attacked a city
[2:32:17] Whitewolf1441: yikes, kinda weird
[2:32:19] Guffels: @numberseal something you enjoy. unless you really just want easiest then prob holy priest or resto shaman
[2:32:24] FLUFFALOBUFFALO: she saved a small countrs economy
[2:32:24] caradea_: @GirthControlPill hahaha what
[2:32:35] Whitewolf1441: @GirthControlPill need this experiment done
[2:32:35] gelth: she's royalty basically lol
[2:32:51] ren0m: This really might be a US thing. I know no one that listens to her. But I'm a man and not 15y old.
[2:33:02] Whitewolf1441: god thats so funny
[2:33:03] numberseal: @Guffels I don't know anything about healing classes at all, so I don't know what I would enjoy
[2:33:12] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: @ren0m well no shit man wow
[2:33:23] Whitewolf1441: @numberseal resto is fun
[2:33:40] ren0m: I'm just saying I don't feel like the hype is as big in Europe
[2:33:44] Xastin3: man i hate nfl oversees games
[2:33:46] xilyx2: so does almost every music and entertainment A lister
[2:33:50] Whitewolf1441: @GirthControlPill why no shit? are you saying americans are the only crazy ones?
[2:33:59] Myusen: @ren0m i think taylor is quite big in eu too
[2:34:00] koala_715: I have friends that are loving it because their young daughters now want to watch football with them.
[2:34:07] WytherOK: well got my 4080 super, thanks nvidia
[2:34:09] ren0m: Maybe, I just haven't noticed
[2:34:12] Xastin3: emergency i dont want to do throne LUL
[2:34:17] xilyx2: @ackbarite exactly
[2:34:22] dithrica: meh I'm 33, ngl Midnights album was great
[2:34:24] Guffels: @numberseal yeah then just pick something. every healer is atleast medium good right now and none of them are super complicated after disc changes recently
[2:34:30] Whitewolf1441: hahahha
[2:34:36] ren0m: And she'll make a breakup song and probably mention the NFL
[2:34:39] ren0m: So another win
[2:34:44] xilyx2: i dont think it fell in their lap.. i think there was jostling with it
[2:34:44] numberseal: @Guffels Okay
[2:34:51] Kuliflop: Kelce and Mahomes are paying for the booth
[2:34:56] dragona92: @ren0m I'm European and a friend of mine is gonna spend like 3k eur for tickets for her concert KEKW
[2:34:57] Xastin3: oh yeah they get 1 minute of taylor and kelce mom every game
[2:35:02] Xastin3: for free
[2:35:08] ren0m: @dragona92 damn
[2:35:23] ren0m: How can a ticket cost 3k?
[2:35:25] koala_715: Yeah NFL don't let the families go for free. They still have to pay a shit load for the booths.
[2:35:31] ren0m: Does Taylor give them a lap dance?
[2:35:39] monochromator: Those marketing agents are rolling in it now with no work done
[2:35:41] Svesno: One of the best TE ever
[2:35:43] frazlord: I picked Travis Kelce first in my fantasy draft. Everyone clowned on me. I won $500.
[2:35:48] Guffels: hes a massive fuckboy. its a great persona for making money
[2:35:50] Xastin3: travis was litterally brawl baltimore
[2:35:50] dragona92: @ren0m I wish... I think it's 3k for 2 tickets but 1,5k ain't too much cheaper
[2:35:54] zebracak35: the fact that conservatives are complaining that its  a joe biden psy-op and that hes scripting the nfl for the chiefs to win for taylor swift so he can steal teh election from trump shows us that we're in the end times
[2:35:58] xilyx2: I think believe it just 'happened' is kinda niave. The guy shes dating has a massive podcast, I think it's all verrrryy convenient but a good win none the less.
[2:36:00] caradea_: the chiefs could get me to visit their games for a more modest fee, might have to get in touch with them
[2:36:19] xilyx2: yea way too perfect.
[2:36:23] Whitewolf1441: but she has to benefit too no? what does she get
[2:36:26] Whitewolf1441: from this
[2:36:36] Whitewolf1441: aw
[2:36:38] chrisb156: she gets a dickin
[2:36:41] Guffels: i mean she might actually just like travis lol
[2:36:42] Ninjian: @Whitewolf1441 shes seeing her BF play football from the nicest seats in the house
[2:36:48] xilyx2: she gets market access too guys.. football fandom is huge.
[2:36:48] Xastin3: i would rather see taylor then fan thats shirtless and overweight
[2:36:56] MasterNewt: 2 albums worth of breakup songs after its over.
[2:37:19] monochromator: People have already made fake songs about them breaking up haha
[2:37:20] the_pyke: so ... after KC a new #1 album incoming :D
[2:37:32] Whitewolf1441: do you think more people will date for marketing now?
[2:37:37] koala_715: It's just hilarious and sad that people REEE about taylor being there and cheering travis on, but cheer when jason get's drunk, shirtless, and is more obnoxiously supportive.
[2:37:38] Whitewolf1441: celebrities
[2:37:43] xilyx2: well im a marketer.. i see the prints on this but obv who knows
[2:37:57] monochromator: Bruh 2023 was the year of finally tapping into the women market. Barbie, Taylor Swift, etc
[2:37:57] Guffels: that is no happening lol
[2:37:57] Svesno: @Whitewolf1441 That is been done for long time already and a lot?
[2:38:04] Xastin3: she has to be there first.
[2:38:05] Whitewolf1441: @Svesno well thats sad
[2:38:05] xilyx2: it might
[2:38:09] caradea_: well
[2:38:22] xilyx2: they could monetize every aspect of that
[2:38:27] the_pyke: so ... go Lions? :D :D
[2:38:38] WytherOK: imagine being travis kelce and being the less rich member of a relationship
[2:38:53] Xastin3: travis only 100's of millions
[2:38:58] Xastin3: less rich Kappa
[2:38:58] Guffels: @WytherOK lol wat thats a great image
[2:39:09] xilyx2: well he is way less rich than taylor lol
[2:39:10] CyonDru: morning JB and chat
[2:39:13] monochromator: @WytherOK Im sure he is A-ok with that
[2:39:15] zebracak35: @WytherOK Tom brady made pennies compared to his ex wife
[2:39:24] WytherOK: zebracak35 that's true, I forgot about that
[2:39:29] Tombah: entangle just tried to assassinate your ass
[2:39:32] Tombah: lmao
[2:39:40] dithrica: @wytherok gotta be careful cause she could straight up buy the team like five times over lol
[2:39:52] koala_715: every bursting week i usually forget it's bursting the first pull and we accidently do like an 8 or 9 roll stack. oops lol
[2:40:20] Xastin3: tom still gets talked about a ton
[2:40:35] Guffels: !vault
[2:40:49] Guffels: thanks bot as always
[2:40:54] dragona92: Tbf as a European - I didn't even know who he is KEKW
[2:41:05] monochromator: Im excited for all the exploding heads if the Chiefs win the SB
[2:41:13] Svesno: I chuckled when some politician said Taylor is with Travis because of money after $70k bonus incentive was triggered
[2:42:05] WytherOK: dithrica except nfl franchises that are bad sell for multiple billions, swift couldn't even approach that chiefs
[2:42:17] Sorr08: I thought after you got 3700 you were gonna push on other classes?
[2:42:23] xilyx2: @Svesno Imagine having a constituency thats so dumb you can say stuff like that and get away with it.
[2:42:56] koala_715: It's interesting everyone seems to think that all of her songs are breakup songs. Just shows they don't understand her music.
[2:43:26] dithrica: @wytherok I was kidding but also that's wild
[2:43:59] Whitewolf1441: @ackbarite not all, but you gotta admit she sort of has a theme
[2:44:06] xilyx2: I feel like if you understand that Taylor is a company, you have an easier time understanding why certain things 'work out perfectly' for her, lol.
[2:44:42] xilyx2: to that end.. im betting on KC lol
[2:45:38] maenkins: and how was the all powerful box today?
[2:45:40] koala_715: @Whitewolf1441 each album has a theme. She's a lyrical genius. They often come off as break up songs. But most of them actually aren't. She has also said she like to write songs that can open ended so they have different meanings to different people
[2:46:46] xilyx2: @ackbarite She has a team of people who is really good at their jobs. I believe you, probably a lot of content in her albums! They're good at that shit

[2:47:59] WytherOK: I mean if you don't learn from jak, I don't know who would help you
[2:48:01] dithrica: @fluffalobuffalo I think growl (yumytv) has mostly been playing disc
[2:48:10] WytherOK: don't watch growl to learn
[2:48:18] dithrica: XD
[2:48:32] WytherOK: he'll just tell you to hit your buttons harder
[2:48:33] xilyx2: yea jak is probably better than moad for learning lol. moad is just mechanically insane
[2:48:41] nightbreeze93: wtf

[2:56:10] Whitewolf1441: @twinkieruler95 same i love food
[2:58:47] klingzundo: @jdotb yooooo question! Is it worth playing Hunter, or dps for that matter, in DF now if the que times are bad? The only time i played wow in my life i mained a tank and que times were so fast, are they bad for hunters?
[2:59:09] monochromator: Half of the reason I play a healer is because of queue times
[2:59:33] klingzundo: thats whar im thinking, I so badly want to play a hunter but im scared that i am gonna have to wait 30 minutes every dungeon
[2:59:51] Guffels: yeah thats all dps
[2:59:54] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:59:54] klingzundo: Im still new to wow, only played for like 3-4 months total
[3:00:08] kelly_mac06: ive never waited 30 minutes per dungeon at max level but for leveling? yea that's about right for all dps
[3:00:12] monochromator: Can always run your own key
[3:00:14] klingzundo: warrior was fun bc i never had to wait, so im thinking doing paladin but i want hunter
[3:00:14] kelly_mac06: it's not a hunter thing duded
[3:00:32] Snizzlenose: how do you get a countdown for flame shock? is it bigwigs?
[3:00:37] klingzundo: i know i am talking about dps in general
[3:00:54] klingzundo: so at max level dps que times are pretty normal, yes?
[3:01:01] dragona92: @Snizzlenose yes
[3:01:18] Sokchoy: push week??
[3:01:21] dragona92: Unles it's the WA, but BW has a personal countdown on events
[3:01:38] Whitewolf1441: this fight is a nightmare
[3:02:04] dragona92: Healer POV is defo nightmare here KEKW
[3:03:04] Hellgrinnnn: timeable ?
[3:03:34] Lara_TV_: Yeah definitely, last boss isn't that long with lust
[3:04:00] dragona92: Think u need like 4-5 minutes for last boss on Tyra. It's about 3 on fort
[3:04:10] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: the doublt pull at the end is always fun
[3:04:22] dragona92: That's where it depletos KEKW
[3:04:42] Hellgrinnnn: ho yeah they didn't bl totem boss
[3:04:51] Hellgrinnnn: wait they did

[3:55:38] FrostmagicED: b/c helm has haste crit and then haste vers in M+
[3:55:48] FrostmagicED: but tier chest has versa on it
[3:55:57] CyonDru: how are keys going today?
[3:56:12] Hellgrinnnn: do you need rise 29 by any chance ?
[3:56:52] FrostmagicED: do u have any tips on getting my 1 minute shadowfiend in my opener
[3:57:13] FrostmagicED: that isn't "don't get a mechanic"
[3:57:14] CyonDru: priest talk LuvSnooze
[3:57:21] kh9911: yo guys what best to choose for push keys ez between disc . mw if anyone can help
[3:57:53] FrostmagicED: @kh9911 Mistweaver will go further with less skill, imho.
[3:59:05] kh9911: @FrostmagicED ty
[3:59:17] FrostmagicED: NOTED
[3:59:34] FrostmagicED: I was missing my shit trying to do the movement and was consistently like 12 seconds off on sf
[3:59:38] realnzall: I'm surprised that I'm actually much more capable at doing the Resto Druid mage tower than doing it on any other healer spec. Mainly because catweaving makes it so I can have DPS spells with the same keybinds as healing spells
[3:59:46] FrostmagicED: and I'm on 42% haste
[4:01:02] Kaizen_UK: Sorry if you get this question alot, but why are many healers running the tank rage heart trinket? @jdotb
[4:01:06] CyonDru: @realnzall that one is p fun on rdruid
[4:01:19] Thv_: It's also pretty good to cancel your penance channel by spamming smite again to get more CDR
[4:01:22] CyonDru: @kaizen_uk it’s broken. good for damage and has a huge shield on a short cd
[4:01:37] Thv_: you lose out on a little penance of course but if you really struggle with the CDR then thats the best way to do it
[4:02:32] Kaizen_UK: @cyondru i see, thanks. I have it but wasn't sure if it was worth dropping voodoo totem as my on use for it
[4:02:35] realnzall: @jdotb Do you have any advice for the Resto Druid mage tower of the type "I wish I knew this when I did it"?
[4:03:59] bruisedcyclist: ty for soundtrack!
[4:04:41] realnzall: Everything alright? you seem so quiet
[4:05:18] CyonDru: I personally think voodoo totem is hot garbage. so I would def swap it out with rageheart if that were an option @kaizen_uk
[4:05:53] CaptainBoop: 4 hours later...
[4:06:15] CyonDru: NA servers back up. weird they went down
[4:06:25] MicHawkh: kekw na servers
[4:06:29] CyonDru: I am going to go through hell to craft T3
[4:06:36] CaptainBoop: blizz laid off servers
[4:06:51] Kaizen_UK: @cyondru ill do a few runs with it and see how it plays out. Thanks for the advice :)
[4:06:55] CyonDru: @michawkh yes I beta test for you guys jdotbComfy
[4:07:11] realnzall: @jdotb I got to the last doors before you get back to your allies. I think that's past the hardest part, right?
[4:07:34] CyonDru: imo the hardest part was the first phase
[4:08:05] CyonDru: yeah that was the hardest part imo
[4:08:10] realnzall: Yeah, I messed up and forgot to kill an orb, and it killed me really fast
[4:09:16] CyonDru: it happens. you’ll get it next time @realnzall
[4:09:54] frazlord: Time to bounce
[4:09:59] theBroHam: 10 min means 30
[4:10:27] s_dawg1: Just 10 more minutes. 3 times more
[4:10:29] CyonDru: is zero still messing around on outlaw
[4:13:25] Whitewolf1441: jb important question, how do you feel about the random nature of the keys you have to run
[4:13:37] Whitewolf1441: (what if you just choose the dungeon and level)
[4:13:47] CyonDru: sounds about right
[4:14:15] stryped: This season you're raiding on priest and pushing on druid. At this point is mythic raid fun since you're not really doing it for gear?
[4:15:45] chaarp: i think fyrakk and tindral are really cool bosses, but it's kinda frustrating progressing it so slowly
[4:15:52] frazlord: No luck replacing the mistweaver?
[4:16:26] ErikJugend: I think it sucks that they removed max ilvl gear from the end bosses, feels shit to be done gearing with my guild having not killed Tindral yet
[4:17:09] Whitewolf1441: he quit???????
[4:17:53] MrDadDude: preach!
[4:17:56] bootymcboatface22: JB do you raid on your druid or something else?
[4:18:03] chaarp: he bailed
[4:18:09] Taijituwu: burnt out
[4:18:10] FrostmagicED: it's easy to say he quit
[4:18:10] stryped: What's the reason you continue raiding then?
[4:18:14] MrDadDude: is he alive lol?
[4:18:15] BradIey: BradIey watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! wow so cool
[4:18:16] Whitewolf1441: kinda weird behaviour, just say you dont wanna raid
[4:18:16] FrostmagicED: he also could have had something happen irl
[4:18:23] SupaCoopa2688: and hasn't like communicated with anyone? thats weird
[4:18:27] Dermonica: Let´s hope nothing bad have happened to him!
[4:18:33] sw0ngs: sounds like he took a sabbatical haha
[4:18:49] Whitewolf1441: wait what does raiding have to do with m+?
[4:18:56] Yrelienne: hey your other stream does not working at least for me
[4:19:01] Taijituwu: i did m+ without raiding for 6 seasons
[4:19:10] Blu_ClosetGamer: im 488 without any raid gear other than heroic trinket last b
[4:19:16] Taijituwu: but i guess it is nice having mythic raid gear
[4:19:54] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[4:20:10] s_dawg1: Augur is really nice as well
[4:20:41] BradIey: unpopular opinion i liked titanforging
[4:20:51] chaarp: @BradIey same
[4:20:52] FrostmagicED: I liked TF except for the triple raid reclear at end of xpac
[4:20:53] Minigamer911: Thunderforging DansGame
[4:20:53] ridder30: fucking loved titanforging
[4:20:56] FrostmagicED: that fucking blew ass
[4:21:23] dingoose88: absolutely
[4:21:25] Morayeden: I hated it at the time. But in retrospect Titanforging was prob a net good for most players.
[4:21:29] BradIey: i used to be a CE raider, i was so happy when i got a max titanforge inkpod with socket
[4:21:53] ridder30: whats funny, is the reason raiders hated titanforging was because mplus players could get raid ilvl gear.  and now they can do that anyway
[4:21:55] s_dawg1: I didnt like titanforging specifically but warforged I really enjoyed
[4:21:55] FrostmagicED: @BradIey and then me; who cleared for it every week and never saw one above half effectiveness
[4:21:56] Sizebot: If titanforging existed in combination with the current upgrade system I would be very happy. Just a nice way to bypass the need for some crests.
[4:22:11] FrostmagicED: @ridder30 raiders hated it because we had to clear the content in ever difficulty
[4:22:13] BradIey: FrostmagicED in my mind i deserved it cause i was also very dry of it :^)
[4:22:51] SupaCoopa2688: Dude in legion I got a titanforged arcanocrystal and never had to replace it the entire expac
[4:23:06] bigviewer3: M+ keystones should only drop from mythic raid bosses
[4:23:16] MrDadDude: at this point, it seems M+ is better content for the majority of players though..
[4:23:21] FrostmagicED: I remember fucking clearing normal/heroic/mythic emerald nightmare on monday with my guild in a 10 man to fucking farm bloodthirsty instincts for our hnter
[4:23:25] FrostmagicED: I dont EVER
[4:23:30] FrostmagicED: want to do that level of degenerac
[4:23:31] FrostmagicED: again
[4:23:38] MrDadDude: the time sink is less and it can scale to your skill level. this promotes an overall more enjoyable experience.
[4:24:03] FrostmagicED: "Oh just don't do that then" ~You get replaced by someone willing to do it
[4:24:08] MrDadDude: imagine if you had "key" levels for raid...
[4:24:21] LCSpartan: Morning JB :)
[4:24:30] MrDadDude: just every week you clear raid you can put in a key the next week that scales it up slightly
[4:24:59] Whitewolf1441: jb if you could play druid on any race which would you choose?
[4:25:01] Sorr08: I thought you were gonna push other classes after getting druid to 3700+?
[4:25:07] LCSpartan: trying to find an alt that i like outside of druid xD
[4:25:45] MrDadDude: Someone PM tettles to say some wild shit so JB has content until raid time
[4:25:59] LCSpartan: kinda like evoker but would rather pull my teeth out than play aug
[4:26:50] ridder30: @MrDadDude just go watch any of his content
[4:27:06] Blu_ClosetGamer: What rating do you think title will end at?
[4:27:16] CyonDru: I thought you were going to join that Group? to replace the healer @jdotb
[4:27:20] CyonDru: sorry I stepped away
[4:27:21] ridder30: yesterday NA was dead
[4:27:27] sw0ngs: mdi time trials messing the queue up?
[4:27:29] Taijituwu: my theory is palworld killed lfg
[4:27:48] Telonus: People probably just kinda done with the patch, waiting for s4
[4:28:17] CyonDru: @taijituwu kekw
[4:28:50] MrDadDude: this season does feel odd.
[4:28:57] Telonus: I don't raid so I kinda just forgot Fyrakk existed
[4:29:05] LCSpartan: yeah i think alot people are kinda just chilling  like atleast my guild is on hiatus until next patch with no set raid days and what not
[4:29:33] MrDadDude: my guild on trindral wall and last night it was clear mental is slipping fast. 3 weeks on tswift
[4:30:04] GoodyGodfather: I just want you to know, your tweets get me through the day good sir @jdotb
[4:31:08] Geveros: you are just too good
[4:31:12] Whitewolf1441: the "future me" concept has improved my life
[4:31:21] CaptainBoop: isnt it always the case that past you messes with current you?
[4:31:22] BradIey: sometimes JB do be tweeting bangers
[4:31:36] Sorr08: Push on resto sham 🙃
[4:32:37] LCSpartan: @CaptainBoop sometimes drunk past me does good things for future hungover me...like ordering pizza
[4:32:46] GoodyGodfather: What earbuds are you using?

[4:35:10] casualshame: Fpund MW?
[4:35:11] Whitewolf1441: thats sad
[4:35:20] BradIey: the EU effect
[4:35:39] MrDadDude: 4 hours raid nights is willdddd
[4:35:40] LCSpartan: it kinda feels like a job weirdly for raids
[4:35:46] BradIey: 3 days is quite a lot though tbh
[4:35:55] stryped: Wait you raid 12 hours a week?
[4:35:57] MrDadDude: 12 hours a week of raiding
[4:36:03] selerf: I've been hearing several streamers dreading fyrak/tindy prog. Are those bosses just absurdly rough?
[4:36:13] Guffels: im getting very tired of smolderon prog. feels like its gunna hard wall us with the number of people dying to random shit
[4:36:16] BradIey: i used to prog raid 2 days 3 hours each and even that felt like a lot :/
[4:36:30] FrostmagicED: but killing them will FEEL good
[4:36:35] sparklifegaming: !mdi
[4:36:37] stryped: My guild is 6 hours a week and are about 100 pulls into Tindral
[4:36:39] FrostmagicED: and you wont have fun on fyrakk when ou know
[4:36:42] LCSpartan: @BradIey thats what we do and we have had probably 1/4th the raid team burn out
[4:36:58] alexxheartless: as satisfying as it is to prog and finally kill mythic bosses, i benched myself this season after we got AOTC because i just couldnt bring myself to sit through those nights of banging our heads against a wall for 4 hours
[4:37:14] GoodyGodfather: The problem with the bosses is they are all super super individual responsibility and random in their patterns it seems
[4:37:55] Guffels: we do 4 hours a week and just passed 100 pulls on smolderon.
[4:38:06] LCSpartan: it feels like they just went back to...someone fucks up...wipe the raid
[4:38:30] luxumbra69: Personally, i like that part of Mythic raid.
[4:38:46] Jogiboio: Hello, i basically only pug, so i was just wondering how much impact efflorecence has on healing checks, since a lot of the time when ppl stand in it its heaven, but when ppl dont its hell
[4:38:47] Blu_ClosetGamer: have you thought of swapping G after this tier? Maybe find one that clears through it faster? Maybe that would make it less painful??
[4:39:27] Jogiboio: TMI: can i shit on ppl if they die on healing checks if they dont stand in my efflo?
[4:39:32] majestictaco0: Tindral and fyrakk is the problem, they're miserable to prog for normal guilds
[4:39:34] ren0m: Have you cleared it on Mythic yet?
[4:39:40] ren0m: I legitimately don't know
[4:39:54] ren0m: %?
[4:40:10] Jogiboio: thinkin verdancy etc
[4:40:24] Jogiboio: ait ty
[4:40:59] Jogiboio: yeah, iget that, but my efflo heaaling is usually around 5m lul
[4:41:43] ridder30: ive noticed that on yalnu ppl know to stand in it
[4:41:44] Jogiboio: ye i mean its more for me to be free to do other shit than spam regrowths
[4:42:18] Jogiboio: yeah its only for certain scenarios

[4:53:28] Lara_TV_: @tylxrwow this
[4:53:39] Khillion1: do you enjoy the content or do you find yourself hooked to the io chase?

[5:05:06] Whitewolf1441: interesting perspective
[5:05:07] ren0m: So basically find other problems to deal with
[5:05:17] CaptainBoop: diversify yo life
[5:05:18] Whitewolf1441: @ren0m better* problems
[5:05:26] theBroHam: Real life problems make video game problems seem small
[5:05:32] Khillion1: love that I get what you mean, a relationship and family really puts things into perspective
[5:05:37] ren0m: So diversify the problems, got it.
[5:05:46] ren0m: Yes, better problems @Whitewolf1441

[5:40:01] spampurge: does jdot pug all his keys?
[5:40:16] Jogiboio: any other mdi strats that helps not getting rekt?
[5:40:33] ren0m: @theBroHam thank you
[5:40:51] theBroHam: np
[5:41:55] Nonyamuff: I wish twitch would fix their fucking phone app
[5:44:23] Guffels: the twitch phone app is ass. I have loved having the youtube stream for mobile even if I miss out on chat
[5:46:05] Jemba: Deadge
[5:46:12] nano1895: :(
[5:46:22] Jogiboio: agree
[5:46:35] WoahNelly: me too
[5:46:36] lolplix: this boss is such a pain
[5:46:37] joffrey0101: agreed
[5:46:47] Jogiboio: i fucking hate that boss as druid
[5:46:51] joffrey0101: it's so stupid to have to play around such an important cd for us
[5:47:10] Sokchoy: is this the last deplete before raid
[5:47:21] apertured_wizard: JB, if you picked up d4, would you play druid? or mix it up?
[5:47:50] JukeboxHey: One more deplete before raid StinkyGlitch StinkyGlitch
[5:47:56] JukeboxHey: JukeboxHey watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! :)
[5:48:15] Sokchoy: key will only be 15 minutes anyway dw
[5:48:17] JukeboxHey: do eet
[5:49:23] Jogiboio: happens to the best man
[5:49:36] i_am_in_stealth: show your talents
[5:50:54] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[5:50:57] FrostmagicED: I was in this boat with a guild perma extending on every boss after volcoross this tier
[5:50:58] gnarrizard: yeah I can never do mythic raiding. I want every boss to be one shot and I get impatient after 1 wipe
[5:50:58] nastye: my thoughts exactly YEP
[5:50:59] Qliimaaxx: /gquit angle
[5:51:04] Whitewolf1441: do you  feel any sense of accomplishment when you kill bosses?
[5:51:06] FrostmagicED: I just quit and found a new guild that was farming bosses
[5:51:15] FrostmagicED: THEN got invited to trial ON Fyrakk so
[5:51:59] Whitewolf1441: recruit your replacement :P
[5:52:20] ren0m: The despair
[5:52:45] ren0m: That sounded like someone who has to wake up at 4 to go to a shitty job LUL
[5:52:45] Blu_ClosetGamer: could you playing priest in raid be adding to the displeasure?
[5:53:01] i_am_in_stealth: Please show me your talents =*
[5:53:37] Guffels: i had a kid and found a 4 hour guild. idk if we ever kill fyrakk but for my first time doing mythic, its been really fun
[5:53:40] leubinator: mdi time trials start in 30 minutes any hot take on the teamcomp
[5:53:49] Piaggio: "i dont want to stop raiding, i just want to stop raiding" KEKW
[5:53:52] cultbaus: streamer hop on xiv
[5:54:02] ren0m: I assume people don't stream time trials?
[5:54:06] Whitewolf1441: gonna be honest jb i wish i was in your place bashing my head against a boss, so much fun to me
[5:54:36] Dermonica: @ren0m No they dont
[5:54:42] ren0m: Don't you have subs?
[5:54:46] Whitewolf1441: you need a break?
[5:54:53] ren0m: @Dermonica makes sense
[5:55:36] Whitewolf1441: did you tell them that?
[5:57:17] Piaggio: from my experience the guilds what go for ranks (even when they are like server 20th) rather than reclear for fun and get slightly higher ranks (irrelevant) go through players much more often yeh
[5:57:38] kondelol: What do you drop to get tranq?
[5:57:43] Whitewolf1441: the decision seems clear to us but we dont love your friends as much as you do
[5:58:24] Miltrath: It's crazy how often a guild is just a random collection of people with wildly different attitudes and expectations
[5:58:51] Whitewolf1441: @Miltrath shouldnt that be made clear when recruiting/joining a guild?
[5:59:16] Miltrath: It should, be yo, check out this guy's parses. We NEED him.
[5:59:17] cultbaus: why are you listening to a playlist called nice hair
[5:59:43] Whitewolf1441: how do they gather consumables lol
[5:59:57] brett1337: 3?? That beats my guild's 1 (me)
[5:59:59] luxumbra69: that's awful to be apart of
[6:00:25] nano1895: LUL
[6:00:25] JukeboxHey: why not find a better guild that is more efficient?
[6:00:50] JukeboxHey: 3 days for 4 hours, there must be another guild that would have a US ass with them
[6:01:19] thataj101: I miss the wow days where guilds where guilds. Covering raid, dungeons and PVP
[6:01:29] FrostmagicED: you COULD find a guild that's killed it though
[6:01:37] FrostmagicED: they aren't going to nerf it untill HoF is over
[6:02:03] leubinator: hof not being full in week 12 is just wild
[6:02:13] Frostfury: Plus it's been a few months and cross-realm not even active for Mythic yet it's so daunting
[6:02:17] Sokchoy: in a normal tier they wouldnt have 800 guilds progging the same last two bosses
[6:02:20] cultbaus: they held balance hostage for rwf and now its happening again for hof
[6:02:21] tsumai: How far off is HOF from being full?
[6:02:22] FrostmagicED: this is how it is, and how it has always been. Nothing has changed. If they nerfed it there'd be a guild that WOULDN'T get top 200 as a result of the prog time. There's a title attached to it. You don't care, but the people that ONLY raid care
[6:02:24] cultbaus: wcyd
[6:02:28] FrostmagicED: 20ish slots @tsumai
[6:02:45] leubinator: 188/200 @tsumai
[6:02:46] Protracks: @tsumai 14 spots left but it'll stay open until reset
[6:02:53] FrostmagicED: that's exactly what your 4 hour guild is doing
[6:03:01] FrostmagicED: pepeLaugh
[6:03:04] Sokchoy: wheres the pash man
[6:03:11] FrostmagicED: if you don't care then... stop raiding
[6:03:13] JukeboxHey: PunOko
[6:03:24] FrostmagicED: what do you even need off of mythic fyrakk that you'll ever see.
[6:03:35] JukeboxHey: When did you stop caring about raiding?
[6:03:36] FrostmagicED: you can find a guild reclearing for SURE
[6:03:41] FrostmagicED: that'll invite you
[6:03:42] JukeboxHey: didnt u raid hardcore in ur past
[6:03:49] luxumbra69: i'm hoping next season we get dinars
[6:03:59] tsumai: I always secretly hope that some other company sees how popular M+ is and makes it a standalone game not tied down by PvP and Raiding,
[6:04:09] FrostmagicED: Bud. I haven't killed Smoldy / Tindy and got invited to trial on Fyrakk
[6:04:11] FrostmagicED: roster boss is REAL
[6:04:33] Protracks: idk most guilds aren't missing healers
[6:04:49] luxumbra69: @Protracks most guilds are missing good healers though.
[6:04:53] FrostmagicED: from *my* perspective you have a unique opportunity as the disc priest player. I'm LEARNING disc live and it's HEALER BURNOUT that's the worst rn
[6:04:54] cultbaus: they certainly arent missing rdruids forced to play disc
[6:04:57] cultbaus: kekw
[6:05:14] FrostmagicED: costs you nothing to look peepoChat
[6:05:22] Miilloo_tv: our druid went mistweaver for tindral/fyrak
[6:05:24] Miilloo_tv: xD
[6:05:32] FrostmagicED: I wish I could just play holy priest on Fyrakk man
[6:05:39] FrostmagicED: It'd be so free
[6:05:44] FrostmagicED: spec is easy
[6:06:14] sw0ngs: pull a sickie
[6:06:19] sw0ngs: take the day off haha
[6:06:37] FrostmagicED: even if you get through intermission; you're making NO prog
[6:06:41] FrostmagicED: you don't have a MW
[6:06:44] FrostmagicED: how tf do you heal the trees
[6:07:24] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[6:07:34] Protracks: I think I saw some private log of 2 scuffed holy priest lightweaver talent trees
[6:07:44] Protracks: being able to without MW but yeah it's not realistic
[6:08:03] Miilloo_tv: the triple big trees
[6:08:07] Miilloo_tv: is gonna be rough without mistweaver
[6:08:12] Miilloo_tv: unless u have 3 priests that can void shift
[6:08:14] JukeboxHey: why is there a MSI desktop living rentfree on ur youtube channel?
[6:08:17] Sokchoy: dont worry its getting deleted on tuesday
[6:08:36] Nonyamuff: It's kinda dumb you have to have a certain comp to do it. But it's WOW
[6:08:41] cultbaus: hey streamer why isnt there an activity scheduled after disc raid in your title
[6:08:46] cultbaus: do you need someone to talk to
[6:08:55] SCxFaytal: gl jdot
[6:09:38] leubinator: if gang activity can do it u can too
[6:10:25] Nonyamuff: I've been trying 3 weeks to get heroic fyrakk...but all the groups fall short
[6:11:32] PapysChulys: It's one of the ting that starts to bother me about WoW and dont get me wrong its the only MMO that makes me stay. But the game is built in a way that you feel force to stay for all the season cause you wont be able to complete content or you gonna fill like you didnt do enough. Compared to games like FFIV that are built so you can go in complete content and take a break
[6:11:42] Guffels: @Nonyamuff do it on reset day. i get a 1 shot every time within the first hour of reset
[6:12:15] PapysChulys: Feel not fill*

[6:26:56] Sokchoy: non-healers giving healer balance opinions peepoLeave
[6:27:14] Rypick: This guy saying healers are balanced then saying there not make up his mind
[6:35:52] SCxFaytal: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[6:36:03] luxumbra69: healers aren't that far out of balance once you consider buffs/debuffs/DR/throughput imo.
[6:36:06] luxumbra69: hpal still dogshit tho
[6:40:00] CaptainBoop: he sleep
[6:40:03] Sorr08: Is no one willing to reroll or recruit a new mw?
[6:40:08] flowerpwrxd: progging this boss looks like what my therapist would tell me to cut out of my life

[6:44:49] CaptainBoop: This reminds me of dancing

[7:04:21] Dean_Zaral: I think they got hit by frontals
[7:05:08] pichuux: i mean, for how many pulls they have done till now, kinda hard to still not get it xD
[7:06:08] pichuux: hard boss anyway
[7:06:11] Dean_Zaral: In mythic all it takes is a couple mistakes and it's a wipe
[7:06:17] pichuux: indeed
[7:06:32] Dean_Zaral: Or a bad overlap of mechanics
[7:06:44] Spritesgud: oh no

[8:08:26] Calair_: If it helps, you can have people assign a big sound effect (or even a TTS) to just the red buff so they only macro on the sound rather than the visual
[8:09:05] Calair_: just in bigwigs, no need to WA mess
[8:09:11] Calair_: theyre different buffs
[8:09:37] Calair_: no, you can play sounds for specific private aura ids
[8:09:44] Calair_: and red/purple are different ids
[8:13:07] Calair_: Lol okay, let me amend my previous statement. BigWigs has most of the private auras, but for some reason they never added the red/purple. It is settable via a WA custom optiion though, screenshot incoming
[8:14:28] purpformance: big ole wet diaper
[8:16:54] Calair_: https://imgur.com/a/oOCc8ga - where the private aura sound settings are in the Liquid Anchor pack.
[8:21:43] Calair_: @SneekzzTV Can you DM me a screenshot of what you're seeing + your settings under that tab? That's what controls  it for me
[8:22:07] Calair_: @SneekzzTV Also if you have anything like OmniCC (not OmniCD) installed that does its own  timers
