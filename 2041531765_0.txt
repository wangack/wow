[3:37:01] KaydenGrey: yazma is such a brick of a boss :(
[3:37:09] Dranni21312: yazma is a pug breaker, especially on tyran
[3:37:10] KaydenGrey: so much dmg goes out on her it's difficult to deal with
[3:37:17] dimi9231: Yazma is awful
[3:37:28] pesach_wow: u can do it zepla
[3:37:29] xCD80: poison sucks
[3:37:34] silviel: @ZeplaHQ Howdy! so have you tried PalWorld already? There is video uploaded already?
[3:37:39] dimi9231: true
[3:37:43] Stoicgamingx: I remember running all the way to the end of the arena to drag out the spirits because they were strong
[3:38:35] dimi9231: Selly gigachad
[3:39:58] awatariusfanum: If you need a key healer add me
[3:39:59] dimi9231: its alright
[3:40:03] Dranni21312: they also made wracking pain undispellable and it's a pain for healers
[3:40:26] pesach_wow: the hardest mechanic in this fight is the small purple swirlie that happens directly under u, it will most likely kill u if you dont move
[3:40:32] xCD80: yes keep calm and keep tryinh
[3:41:04] LordConga: zeplaQnotes zeplaQthink
[3:41:06] dimi9231: if tyime runs out the key disappears or am i remembering wrong?
[3:41:29] dimi9231: or it drops down a level
[3:42:07] Dranni21312: @dimi9231 it deplets, which means you'll get a lower key at the end
[3:42:12] darthkazu: im too scared to do any of this crazy mythic+ stuff. im just gonna be runnin around pickin up leaves and making potions
[3:42:28] dimi9231: @Dranni21312 thanks
[3:43:07] Dranni21312: if they kill the boss and finish the dungeon, her 18 will turn into a 17 from the pool of dungeons; if they don't finish the key, her key will turn into 17 Atal Dazar

[3:46:05] rob487h: Zepla is OP
[3:46:49] Alastor7783: also, ppl can't break the CC cuz they're not attackable
[3:46:54] dimi9231: the mobs go to bedge
[3:47:10] pesach_wow: great healing!
[3:47:16] MysticalOS: and specs with passive slows like frost mages are horrible sanguine weeks
[3:47:22] MysticalOS: fortunately not popular this expansion

[3:49:34] dimi9231: shaman great class
[3:49:38] Dranni21312: waycrest is one of the easier dungeons, i wouldn't say first boss is difficult, but I guess it depends on if you know what you're doing NODDERS
[3:49:41] nightst314: besides tree being brutal on high tyrannical WCM has the highest success rate
[3:49:57] volus1: Been maining enhance since bc
[3:50:09] pesach_wow: whenever u think a dungeon is hard, just remember it's not Neverreap
[3:50:16] Dranni21312: at least all the doors are open this time around KEKL
[3:50:18] pesach_wow: thats how i cope
[3:50:23] volus1: That tree hits like a truck on tyrannical
[3:50:49] dimi9231: @Dranni21312 and no boulders :D

[4:18:32] taranathome: second vault slot?
[4:18:56] Lorrdzik: for second slot you need 4 dungeons done
[4:19:07] KaydenGrey: @dimi9231 it wasn't a theory, it was fully datamined and everything, a raid was going to be in it and it was going to involve Tyrande and the Night Fae. They cut it early on when the reaction to shadowlands was becoming a riot
[4:19:34] LordConga: zeplaQnotes zeplaQnotes zeplaQyay

[4:21:59] Lorrdzik: @taranathome it could be, I dont know how many she did, saw only 2
[4:22:03] OMGJesuis: @Whiskerbond I disagree, the crafting is quite straightforward. The complication is to get the crafting classes proper leveled.
[4:22:22] dimi9231: yep it looks complicated
[4:22:47] DrSoulBrew: @OMGJesuis Yeah the leveling for the professions is quite a drag-- takes a good while.
