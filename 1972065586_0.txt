[0:26:22] Kong1290: @bbq489 look at Rockstar twitter
[0:26:28] YoYo49111: Yea thats how nopixel works
[0:26:28] hakst3r123: It'll probably come out in 2025 so at that point, the 2000 series would become obsolete. @shroud

[0:27:09] GlGa: I dont think they'll have a dedicated RP server, they hired teh FiveM crew which is more about hosting private servers than just RP servers, it's more likely that they'll just have that integrated into their base system and let people make their own servers much easier.

[0:50:30] kay_paxx: Would you ever make your own Esports team?

[1:39:57] KJstan: They make more money off the software, like kik runs off the aws streaming stuff
[1:39:58] krak2q: no
[1:39:58] arkunah: Twitch would still use AWS, so they would still make money :D
[1:39:58] xmoiiboiix: let me talk to Jeff rq

[1:41:07] DystceBtwen: 35% of Amazons Revenue is from Twitch @shroud  -- I don't think its going anywhere.
[1:41:07] Alaziara: @Alaziara god damn it lmfao
[1:41:11] amadrob: You still have stakeholders to answer to. You cannot spend money blindly
[1:41:11] Androzis: HHI DADDY

[1:41:39] Zarke___: maybe they dont see much profit?
[1:41:40] Doomsday1201: AV1 would be the next big thing for twitch, they just don’t care
[1:41:40] maestr0: bro why did youtube enter the streaming space and do literally nothing for their streaming homepage/UX
[1:41:43] dustyraydiaz: This is the live streaming app. When I think live streaming I think of this platform, and would never trade that for anything because so far I love this community.
[1:41:44] FalconPreacher: Was tha amazon outside?

[2:04:56] DanielFAILED: Also just drive and save the life
[2:04:56] RoastBeefPoboy: there is a certain amount of understanding, you would probably get a police escort if it was a real emergency
[2:04:56] ace___135: yes intent would matter and you will be fined not jailed
[2:04:58] cranza: U just your pants and tell them you are sorry they will let u go

[2:05:12] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[2:05:13] JTasu: You'd get a ticket -- and then you could go to court to appeal it, judge would probably look at it, and maybe give you leniency based on your situation.
[2:05:15] mik_2_: no matter the cause. Legal consequences are same.
[2:05:17] JIGGLESSSSS: As long as you drive fast enough to drive away from the cops your fine
[2:05:18] M4sterPe4ce: It depend a lot on the cops you talk to, if you get pulled over

[2:05:22] jlasp1re: Ticket driving without license
[2:05:27] itssbounty: Can I see your iron man suit?!😍
[2:05:29] tiptopbigdog: So are you implying you actually know how to drive
[2:05:29] Papai_gsT: just start speaking spanish and say no ingles. They will let u go
[2:05:32] jedidiah0024: been to new zealand bro?

[2:05:36] bqgaming112: GTA 6 poggg
[2:05:37] ev4n: if you save someones life i can almost guarantee you wont get a ticket
[2:05:37] TheOriginalMikey: Nurse here. They won’t ask. If they do you’ll get in trouble regardless. But it’s up to the cop, sometimes they will actually let you slide or you can fight it in court.
[2:05:41] beastlyhoods: just get your license lol it cost like 26$ every 4 years
[2:05:46] Killysunt420: depends on emergency too i guess
[2:05:46] HRQ99: Nothing happens, obvius you depends of the cop.
[2:05:47] Snack4U: idk how it is in america, but here you get treated faster, if you get there by a emergency call.
[2:05:49] blissfulparanoia: @GoHello123 so a fraction of what it costs to get call ambulance
[2:05:50] LoKiSMS: You wouldn't go to jail LUL
[2:05:52] Mattikulous: Ambulance. They would get there to stabilize, then move them. As honest as it may be, they are still breaking the law, and could cause further injury when diving.
[2:05:53] Yolo_Andthenagain: the jail time is only for poor people thoughj
[2:05:55] uncuzimagyi21: Doe shroud know how to driv
[2:05:57] ventrixs1: just fly with ur iron man suit duhhhh
[2:05:58] mik_2_: in some states there is a defence of "necessity" or "choice of evils"
[2:05:59] brokenanklesfpv: i think it would depend on the cop as well a lot of variables
[2:05:59] dust17: Yeah but call first 911 and you have a defence
[2:06:00] mossmanGABE: thats max penalty tho
[2:06:00] BigRoss2170: Only illegal if you get caught then you just be like yea I'm shroud so I'm kind of a big deal also god gamer
[2:06:00] ShaxArc: so the answer is yes , you would be allowed to drive if there really was an emergency
[2:06:02] Saccaa: just drive safely and you don't get caught
[2:06:02] stony48: Silverhand
[2:06:04] iplayvideogameshahahaha: I went to jail
[2:06:04] eriksen29: w
[2:06:04] ogjunior421: they would just slap you on the wrist
[2:06:07] GlutenFreeVapes: You can almost always, pay it's capitalism
[2:06:11] JustDivis: what if someone threatens to beat me up, but I, an unlicensed driver, run them over in pre-meditated self defense?
[2:06:16] schneezit1: jail stream could be pretty pog tho
