[1:52:55] Skry667: i think 2 points of ignite is same % as 3
[1:53:06] fiskensfriend: @Ziqoftw if u take spell power rune ur ignite gets value from the 1.75x crits which is kinda huge

[2:07:54] noxheart: yea mages would never do some op shit in classic
[2:07:56] spacecowboyr: it'd be cool if they put in like a version of deep freeze for mage with a decent CD that could stun, or be used a defensive to block as a rune. make it self heal too. basically Lissandra's ult in League.
[2:08:15] Vir0n: @jaeger4kd it's all non-hard cc
[2:08:17] ExSpurtMEMES: wonder if they will give rogues recoup?
[2:09:23] jaeger4kd: @Vir0n Well as a shaman i hav to pray for procs most of the time, because the pushback on spells is insane, kiting with a mild slow is rarely very effective

[4:31:25] akonel89: Somebody had to figure it out too
[4:31:26] COMMEdesRATS: True
[4:31:33] sjokkateer: that's wild
[4:31:46] AidizzleTV: I cant believe Ive watched this entire thing
[4:31:47] hotmanpop: you would NEVER see that in retail.. :(
[4:31:49] Fogged: my buddy still has his char with scarablord and mouont from OG vanilla
[4:31:54] eyekon_ysl: yeah it takes a whole raid pretty much
[4:31:56] Fogged: doing this back in the day was insanity
[4:31:59] marshedpotato: the best part was layering was disabled when this quest dropped
[4:32:00] ranond: entire server has to help... questline opens when all supplies are turned in
[4:32:07] marshedpotato: no layering was peak classic
[4:32:16] vbx93: "figure it out"
[4:32:25] akonel89: "where is the big chicken" kekz

[4:34:30] zwussel: i think azuregos was supposed to protect the blue shard but he got bored and didnt want to do it anymore so he gave it to the shark xD
[4:34:37] marshedpotato: The start of the quest is gated behind a brutal rep grind, you need to farm 40,000 bug parts. so getting multiple people to start the quest at the same time is very challenging
[4:34:37] Korvynah: this might be one of the greatest wow videos of all time
