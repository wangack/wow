[2:34:23] Solushun: as a warrior main i must ask myself these things
[2:35:16] Guelag: @Solushun its not S tier but cata is as balanced as pvp gets out of any expansion. so dont FOTM like a rat and play a class you genuinely like
[2:36:05] Solushun: playing a class i genuinely like means rdruid WOOO good times ahead

[3:06:30] Tekayama: 2 raiders from Tekayama have joined! 
[3:06:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: The way Blizzard have it set up, clearing the raid on heroic is where the big bump up comes from, and doing the mythic raid gives the best boost to it
[3:07:32] avenueone: still never got it from heroic after seeing so many 420 ilvl ppl get it off heroic
[3:07:33] al_capow: yooo
[3:07:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: In the datamining article, they say like 15 heroic Fyrakk kills is a guaranteed axe drop
[3:08:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: The axe can drop for the raid apart from dropping as personal loot, so there is always some chance
