[2:26:07] Terinn23: @Towelliee what do you think of the Heroic plus dungeons?
[2:26:41] xmedpakx: does anyone know the name of the stats weak aura?
[2:26:49] Finiin: yea nax 10
[2:27:15] Terinn23: yea that is what I was wondering
[2:27:48] wildwittra: i read it as a catchup from Heroic dungeons to raid-ready. instead of running Naxx10 for gear you can run Dungeons+
[2:28:28] wildwittra: i read it as Blizz think there will not be enough raid-groups for people to gear in

[2:28:33] Kyrioz: im not sure how much more time i will put into wotlk haha with pre patch coming soon i feel like i should take this time to play a dif game haha
[2:28:39] JerBoody: Naxx 10 gear really better than emblem gear was it?
[2:28:45] Contendedlemon: in the spirit of classic!
[2:28:49] oSpaced: 100% LUL LUL
[2:29:13] Terinn23: Yea I don't think it will be harder and I think ppl will face roll
[2:30:11] JerBoody: Well that was the real problem in classic wow, if you didn’t raid naxx, you couldn’t raid ulduar but no one was raiding naxx once ulduar was out so idk
[2:31:54] JerBoody: The evoker rotation looks painfully simple
[2:32:04] Kneckt: yeah u kinda just press buttons lol
[2:32:09] Kneckt: and do damage
[2:32:11] Contendedlemon: but i typed "advanced" when creating an evoker!
[2:32:26] JerBoody: Controller friendly?
[2:32:49] Kneckt: i think do
[2:32:49] Lorilath: evoker healer has a lot of buttons
[2:32:50] Attackroot: ya its fun tho so far for what ive played of it healing
[2:32:50] Kneckt: so
[2:33:41] pavepawns: is there raid testing tonight?
[2:33:51] Plague_GG: I don’t understand the spells. You have 2 fillers 2 spenders and 2 empower spells. Seems like they need to synergize them more. Maybe im not talented right.
[2:34:06] JerBoody: Evokers look super silly from a thematics and aesthetics perspective

[2:39:10] Kneckt: that is true, i did not miss any of the one shot mechanics while testing
[2:39:26] Kneckt: felt more of a fair fight lol
[2:39:34] pavepawns: i dont mind 1 shot mechanics as long as it isnt being left in someone elses hands whether i live or die
[2:39:45] PvtHudson093: oh god not this place
[2:39:55] pavepawns: gotcha
[2:40:03] PvtHudson093: rygalon

[2:41:56] KuromiBlackheart: EXP buff on the 4th right?
[2:42:00] Sertrunku: they see it as a catch up mechanic
[2:42:00] pavepawns: i think 3-4 weeks would be a better amount
[2:42:19] BenBeckman1: @Towelliee missing ur aggro buff
[2:42:38] SilkeySmooth: launch the catalyst early or no tier sets at all until after the first riad
[2:43:17] PvtHudson093: 6 weeks seems like a long time
[2:43:58] pavepawns: atleast our tier sets this time around arent busted so its not a must have instantly
[2:43:59] Kyrioz: i remember when this first game out and people had no idea how tro do the drakes lol

[2:57:21] Kyrioz: why everyone just goes zerg drakes

[2:58:43] realnzall: Morning from Belgium Roberto! It's my birthday today, I turn 32
[2:59:03] JerBoody: Yea but if you target them, then it jumps to the boss and hits him harder

[5:02:32] mozavich: @Rudric_Ice yes, wrath
[5:02:35] Meanfellah: @kuulibar depends on class and what your definition of "best way to lvl" is... because if you want the fastest -> aoe killing mobs in IC is the fastest, if you want the best way to do it while maintaining a method to get as much gold as possible from questing, then dungeons is the best, if you want to get 80 and hunt for achievements at the same time, then questing is the best way to lvl .... so it depends
[5:02:46] j3pp3tt0: I think XP boost in retail starts next week, I could be mistaken

[5:26:51] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: In the show The Wire in the 3rd season, this 1 character recently got out of prison and needed to go in to get drug tested. So his "colleagues" took him to this 1 corner to buy pee from a guy who keeps them in a trench coat "I get mine from the daycare" I can imagine some players doing something like that lol
[5:27:06] bip118: batting leadoff for no reason, no offense Boone. but what happens when Benintendi comes back
[5:27:16] tocu: This whole discussion just reminded me that Ken Griffey JR was the great player in the 90s

[5:29:07] j3pp3tt0: It sure did. Was a different era and hitting like that still takes skill. I think pretty much everyone was juicing during that era
[5:29:42] Denat0: i just looked....if you're looking to buy belts for emblems they're typically 40
[5:29:42] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: I need 0.52 points today from the 49ers defense to win my fantasy matchup

[5:49:28] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I remember when they were talking about the problem with "MEGA DAMAGE" numbers and how they wanted to squish that. Whereas Diablo 3 was like "I like that...Mega damage" Now you can crit in the trillions in D3

[6:15:10] Nico_vdM: but we usually kept a charge or 2 for last boss
[6:15:18] BoogieDuck: Good morning Team T...
[6:15:41] tn_lukeduke: this looks like a great PvP map
[6:15:42] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Run away little girl, Run away!

[6:17:43] Stiffy84: how long do u think till we see prepatch? end of this month?
[6:18:07] 3663Sharad: Seeing the "old" dragon models from WotLK and the new DF ones, I feel like the new models looking to clean

[6:19:15] durrttee: Darkmoon card
[6:19:19] Talason: aka dmf trinket
[6:19:22] Gingerprimer: I guess they just did want to mess with "balance"
[6:19:35] AlfredK: When are you switching between the seals?
[6:19:48] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I make tanks *work* for their meal on my afflock in wrath classic. Even prot pallies

[6:21:05] headshot_hunter6: what bags do you have towelliee, i have 3 spare frostweave bags
[6:21:10] FutileDiploma: @towelliee I know why they a pushing content out so quick but do you think the game is going to suffer with a launch this year? Or do you think it’s ready with your beta experience.
[6:21:15] Crudler1: spoken like a true pally haha
[6:22:06] headshot_hunter6: check your mail in an hour

[6:22:38] Nico_vdM: it will be more or less ready as SL
[6:22:56] theoriginalzinng: i was legitimately concerned about tier set balancing until i saw the boring and honestly easy to tune tier sets
[6:23:05] tedol: it won't crash, that for sure
[6:23:18] ggilgamech: they think it's ready*
[6:23:19] mavericks312: every xpac has worked from the start just cause you dont like a talent doesnt mean it isnt ready
[6:23:23] FutileDiploma: 2 months aka the dev have 1440 hours to get it ready
[6:23:25] bfjacke: They launched cyberpunk when it was ready. Otherwise they wouldnt have launched it

[6:23:39] grylz89: I'll dip my feet in DF but man wotlk had my full attention.  such a great expansion
[6:23:54] lithium364: why not delay the expansion to lessen crunch for the dev themselves then?
[6:23:55] Gauner_: Buff warlocks
[6:24:04] tedol: @bfjacke that why I won't get AAA game for full price anymore
[6:24:04] joeyshades101: blink if you are under duress

[6:24:16] FutileDiploma: I don’t like my class in dragon flight…..ok I’ll boost a prot warrior
[6:24:30] Nico_vdM: Look at it this way. They could have dropped it 31 December, but chose 28 Nov
[6:24:32] theoriginalzinng: warlocks do need some tuning in df lol
[6:25:12] headshot_hunter6: i sent you 3 frostweave bags towelliee, check your mail in an hour
[6:25:17] falldrgn: If people can do  the major components, M+, Questing, DF and crafting  and the talents are 95% good, its fine, they can adjust
[6:25:28] mavericks312: tuning doesnt equate to an xpac not working
[6:25:34] Alepouditsa: danKEK
[6:25:34] cynical_effect12: HOW ABOUT THEM TITANS!
[6:25:36] lithium364: prot paladins sadge
[6:25:45] Contendedlemon: moonwalking dragon
[6:26:08] Gingerprimer: @Nico_vdM they could have dropped it at any time they wanted
[6:26:09] mavericks312: imagine the falcons being tied for first and the colts being damn near in last place
[6:26:33] Molvonos: Fuck no, lol

[6:33:14] AlfredK: Would be nice if all players would come in completely blind to the raids. No idea about the bosses or abilities. Ofc they would have to test it properly internally.

[7:07:02] Taaliaaaa: its back for DF then??
[7:07:26] coldhandsbeatz: He said timewalking @taaliaaaa haha you got confused. Nothing forged at all
[7:07:44] LSBreed: I feel like that mom has evaded there since original wrath
[7:07:45] AkuTVgg: They have a perfect race/class alignment (per faction). A new allied race throws off my 0 overlap lol
[7:07:49] LSBreed: mob*
[7:07:54] FrozenBroo: Tuskar when
[7:08:04] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I always wanted The Ethereals as an allied race
[7:08:06] Whoracle1337: we have killed to many murloc lmao
[7:08:06] kalamari__: @Taaliaaaa you probably heard about the few special drop items with a slightly higher ilvl
[7:08:08] Nutqase: murloc is the only allied race i want
[7:08:11] Animemron: Ogres have to be a allied race for horde. I mean they are already in the horde
[7:08:13] Fugazi811: housing LUL

[7:08:43] Taaliaaaa: @Zulesh I read this stupid question about warforging and thought it didnt get removed
[7:08:51] dyslexican1: Murlocks as a alied race is my favorite meme. I would love it.. but its also rediculus!
[7:09:01] Nutqase: they should have added murlocs as an race from the start
[7:09:10] Nutqase: *playable
[7:09:23] Peepo95: I can only loot hc dungeon once per day right?
[7:09:58] LeGoogs: Towellie bout to be retired before housing
[7:10:05] tocu: the barracks was housing at home
[7:10:09] coldhandsbeatz: I think housing is 11.0
[7:10:16] byrdeen45: I dont know why they would be against it
[7:10:25] SpeciousArgument: problem with housing is that it's almost always instanced. rarely something in the open world
[7:10:30] kalamari__: they also should revamp ground mounts
[7:10:31] Trawkey: we had housing and everyone hated it..
[7:10:46] FrozenBroo: They've done good with the character customization but I'd like more, or just a general graphics overhaul for older content
[7:10:48] jenos01: Housing 11.0 copium
[7:10:51] Vashetlee: Garrisons was a step towards housing but not fully
[7:11:16] SpeciousArgument: game feels dead when everyone is hiding in their garrison
[7:11:16] Storm_Taker: morning everyone
[7:11:29] ShadoodHD: like ff14 housing 4Head
[7:11:39] byrdeen45: Wildstar had the best houseing
[7:11:58] sellig: should be pure cosmetically but still have a social impact
[7:11:59] dyslexican1: Everyone: We want player housing... also everyone: Garisons suck
[7:12:00] LeGoogs: Just make it solely cosmetic and maybe add a secondary profession for like furnishing.
[7:12:07] sellig: so not on a separate shard
[7:12:14] Vashetlee: ESO housing is pretty good

[7:13:07] Vashetlee: @vajankle_kj true
[7:13:20] LeGoogs: Yo Runescape has had housing for almost 2 decades now and make a whole skill for it.
[7:13:28] sm0keo: swtor too
[7:13:29] headshot_hunter6: lost ark housing is pretty cool
[7:13:33] sm0keo: yea they al ldo
[7:13:37] Zettabyte: Even SWG (restoration) have
[7:13:48] ShadoodHD: ffxiv housing is wild, i've seen a lot of custom decors that makes it cool
[7:13:54] DeCoyThatGuy: BDO
[7:13:55] Deadly26: Wildstar Kappa
[7:13:57] WhiteKnight74648: Wildstar
[7:14:03] Vashetlee: Soooo what you are saying is WoW is still being unique?
[7:14:06] Pyrophilia264: ff14 is the best housing mmo
[7:14:08] FrozenBroo: Rift still exists? Wild
[7:14:24] Bakasumi: wildstar had the best
[7:14:24] SpeciousArgument: any housing system that is in the open world, without feeling like a ghost town, would be awesome
[7:14:37] Whoracle1337: housing didnt save wildstar xD
[7:14:39] billybaggens: new world has it
[7:14:40] abracka_: good mornin towHAMUP
[7:14:45] portend: EverQuest 2 had decent housing
[7:14:50] Mostdangspy: Everquest has has housing
[7:14:54] portend: They didn't at first
[7:14:55] FrozenBroo: even runescape has housing
[7:14:57] DoubleKillDan: runescape has it
[7:15:15] lurker198: and housing is stupid in all of those games, in my opinion
[7:15:16] Cacos: I remember Lineage 2 has/had housing and even castles you could bid/fight for
[7:15:27] heydjzs: wow doesnt need it really
[7:15:35] Quakezilla69: SWG had the best
[7:15:35] DeCoyThatGuy: @Mostdangspy Everquest 1 did not have housing, but EQ2 did, but was the worst. cause ppl can come in and move all your stuff to the front of your door.
[7:15:39] tocu: I worry its great and it still has the ff14 issue of not beign enough
[7:15:44] sm0keo: yeah garrison was pretty much an expansion feature lol
[7:15:46] raldrik: it has to be awesome and not be tied directly to an expansion. Cant give housing for 2 years then take it away
[7:15:46] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: why not revamp garrison
[7:15:47] Vashetlee: I think WoW go so much backlash about garrisons they didn’t want to try again
[7:15:49] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: lol
[7:15:52] sm0keo: housing has to be like, a forever thing lol
[7:15:53] Zippaya: Garison was fine
[7:16:02] Redpandalol: @towelliee for df the gearing plan is get to max level then jump into mythic 0 then fill in holes with crafted gear? Coming from a tank perspective
[7:16:04] SpeciousArgument: would be neat if achievements unlocked decorations for your house. And professions could create furniture/carpets/drapes :)
[7:16:19] GodTheMechanic: Hire some interior designers
[7:16:19] portend: @DeCoyThatGuy I heard that changed later on, but then again I haven't touched the game in years like I did with the first EverQuest
[7:16:21] sm0keo: nah, i just want rare furniture from doing achievements, thats whatll make housing cool for me
[7:16:27] abracka_: yeah the way to get a house in XIV is a nightmare. i think new world did a great job with their housing system
[7:16:28] MammothGB: I wonder if Garrisons + Class halls were blizz testing the water and decided against dedicated housing
[7:16:30] Proto_Paradigm: @Towelliee what about guild housing instead of individual player housing like they have in Warframe?
[7:16:36] jerexify: jerexify subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 34 months. Dang. Almost to that 3 year mark already.
[7:16:46] Mostdangspy: @DeCoyThatGuy EQ1 has housing now, I kind of like the way they do it. That crazy about EQ2 though
[7:17:00] thebakeriscomingforu: class order halls were cool
[7:17:03] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: or give us a aachievement points vendor and let us spend are points
[7:17:22] BlewGamingGroup: go back to guild perks
[7:17:42] RemwayTV: They tried that in cata
[7:17:49] silversoidier: How can you find guilds? Looking for m+ mostly
[7:17:50] sm0keo: i mean, they can add cool furniture or something for guilds getting mythic kills or something if they add guild housing
[7:17:51] MammothGB: I'd say the average guild isn't as social as it was 5-10yrs ago
[7:17:58] FrozenBroo: I join guilds on retail to get the hearthstone CD and nothing else, basically
[7:18:04] actionring123: watching people sleep has to be the weirdest twitch evolution ever
[7:18:23] ChrisFitz: Ret pally here! What rep should i do first????

[7:20:59] abracka_: that was a cursed message
[7:21:04] LeGoogs: Sus ass question
[7:21:06] BlewGamingGroup: i think with the hosting channel going away . sleep streams are going to become more prevalent because streamers dont want to lose the viewers that are sitting afk in their chat channel
[7:21:12] DilanaLynn: I think waking up in the streaming room would be a hint you're live LUL
[7:21:14] DovahChicken: @Towelliee  Hello! how has your day been?   also do we have any date on pre patch for retail?

[7:30:17] TacDuc: @Mostdangspy Fat helps against spicy stuff
[7:30:36] DeCoyThatGuy: butter coats the lining of your stomach and intestines
[7:30:42] EpicJune: heard snails help too Kappa
[7:30:47] supersmak: Anything to coat your stomach ahead of time will help with the cap cramps, but not the heat
[7:30:50] FrozenBroo: Have some milk or something handy, it's dairy for spicy isn't it?
[7:30:54] Wulfgrym: its fat so it works with the oils from the spice
[7:30:59] VigorHabitus: capsaicin is fat soluble, not water soluble, that's why
[7:31:06] Featherbow: my dad eats ghost peppers like candy. We got him the death nut challenge as a bit of a joke and he only had a mild case of indegestion. Mom and I think he might not be human lol
[7:31:18] discodarth: how many days i've spent farming saronite for all these years NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[7:31:21] Sir_Cranium: Milk and bread help for the heat
[7:31:28] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: The best drink for spicy stuff is a White Russian, The alcohol breaks down the capsaicin and the cream soothes the tissue and coats the stomach
[7:31:29] Wulfgrym: what was his stomach made of asbestos?
[7:31:32] tocu: or just be david blaine and magic your way out of hot stuff. Dude didnt even flinch at da bomb and called it good like wtf

[7:32:47] Whoracle1337: alcohol doesnt do shit
[7:33:05] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Moistcritical went delirious from the wing challenge
[7:33:05] supersmak: That's nothing compared to the death nut
[7:33:18] MammothGB: Oh yeah, the spice sets in on the pauses
[7:33:23] ClassicMalcontent: @featherbow heh phew yeah. I can handle some pretty hot spice but I hit a limit and that's above my limit.
[7:33:31] TacDuc: @ClassicMalcontent Yeah, if you eat lots of spices and such, other food begins tasting bland, but you can stop eating spicy stuff and then get your taste buds used to non-spiced food again
[7:33:32] Megadisaster24: Death Nut is like 5 times worse
[7:34:18] ClassicMalcontent: @TacDuc I like spicy. But I do have a limit. It's Medium-Hot and then I start to go, okay I'm good. Ha.

[7:34:32] Rottencoarse: poor Terry lol

[7:47:56] Kinkd: socks/carpet is fine as long as you're grounding yourself such as touching the back of the power supply while it's plugged in/switched off.

[7:48:52] mozavich: @reacttime_enjoyer @reacttime_enjoyer @FrozenBroo it's not collectors. it's the heroic/epic digital bundles that blizzard had for sale. there wasn't a collector's edition of wrath classic unfortunately.

[8:23:42] itsbananas01: LUL Same
[8:23:43] gidgeet: agreed
[8:24:02] Mecabeast: the trailer did nothing but show off dragon riding
[8:24:05] CrusaderNero: well nothing beats the wotlk trailer. maybe the wod one
[8:24:09] Blah206: TRUE
[8:24:13] jaygutta504: Hurricane?
[8:24:13] Moobot: Details for DF Beta https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files/3974119
[8:24:15] Aquadriel: @Towelliee that trailer had the hype levels 9.2 patch trailer did KEKW
[8:24:21] dimofodi: How do you feel about the different tanks? Will you be going back to Paladin from BrM or is BrM still going to be better?
[8:24:21] BlewGamingGroup: they just need to let hurricane do all their trailers
[8:24:27] zysmos: yeah that trailer was so disney LUL
[8:24:28] raldrik: DF trailer looked like classic. It felt old and dated
[8:24:30] tocu: Also they  released that trailer within weeks of the God of War trailer your just going to look bad at that point
[8:24:49] BlewGamingGroup: give him a team of 10-15 people  and let him go to work
[8:24:55] EpicJune: yeah DF trailer was i pretty forgetable tbh
[8:25:21] Mecabeast: can we also have him do the in game cinematics as well as trailers?
[8:25:24] kokochris: anyone got link ?
[8:25:26] zysmos: yeah the reveal cinematic was great
[8:25:27] Blah206: lol
[8:25:42] joey1123: I sure hope DF wont disappoint us
[8:25:43] im_capy: funny how thats how wow kinda started too. Outside the fringe people like Jeff being brought in
[8:25:50] Karbonn: TBH they need to take a page from Bungie and Destiny 2 trailers. They have that locked down on the hype part.
[8:26:03] zysmos: the trailer was just a dragonriding showcase LUL
[8:26:14] Crauhm: DF will be dog shit. Nothing can compare to wrath
[8:26:39] MoonChocolates: lol
[8:26:39] Blah206: LUL
[8:26:49] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: The thing about that cinematic he did. It *felt* more like WoW, than the CGI trailers they do. Those CGI trailers are amazing, but they don't feel like WoW. They feel like a CGI movie trailer.
[8:26:54] joey1123: @Crauhm what do you like about Wrath ? Anything in particular?
[8:26:55] aesirsghost: SWTOR cinematics slapped so hard
[8:26:58] kokochris: @Crauhm danDerp

[8:27:50] BMagicTX: Morning ! @Towelliee  how you making out gearing etc?
[8:27:55] Beined: is it the roid era record?
[8:27:55] Gibsonex937: I played wow on release a lot of us actually quit first two weeks of wrath.
[8:27:57] mavericks312: legion  > wrath
[8:27:58] joey1123: I think the hype about wrath is just mainly because of nostalgia, thats why old school runescape is still that popular
[8:27:59] tocu: Wrath is also the 2nd best mmo exspsnasion ever for me so its not shocking its still solid

[8:31:41] Mylamage: wrath is easy
[8:31:43] macrolom: Towe  don't you think sometimes the idea of games without content or boring like wow, comes from the streamers that plays long session that in reality the 80% of the player base wouldn't do it or een can't?, I mean how many pple is able to play every day for 8 hours?
[8:31:43] inj0shwetrust: Us retail andys also played wrath when it was retail

[8:32:01] KaisenSiru: HUH. I got Heroic LK 25m Realm First. You'd think I''d be all over Wrath, but I'm not. Definitely prefer current WoW over anything Classic

[8:36:44] Se7enthSinn: Before LK there was C'Thun.. hard as fuck
[8:36:45] kokochris: @DeadMayn yup. WoW perfected the theme park MMO. I came from EQ and Asherons Call.  WoW felt casual.  Thats not a bad thing.  They improved the systems, mechanics and made the game more enjoyable.
[8:36:45] Mylamage: the literal computer god
[8:36:45] pk99: nah you just said skinny man undertones LuL
[8:36:48] MoonChocolates: Playing both retail and classic makes me love the game even more. I can see how far the game came and what its missing etc. I still like the graphics of retail
[8:36:58] KaisenSiru: @mavericks312 Thats what I'm saying, take the limited attempts out, it would've been defeated quick by the top guilds
[8:36:59] Spathotan: How was his video a "shit on"? Are we hating on Starforge because its OTK or because it isnt Origin? Im confused

[8:37:58] kokochris: @DeadMayn 200% my man. I would never want to go back to my EQ and AC days (as much as I loved them at the time)
[8:37:59] iknowido: Lol

[8:38:53] Se7enthSinn: Kil'Jaeden wasnt even the hardest boss.. M'uru was
[8:38:59] Joren456: everquest was stupid. grinding for 12 hours straight just to see your exp move a little. noone has time for that
[8:39:02] tocu: The most hardcore Everyquest raider is the dude who invented the cosby room so thats not a great thing
[8:39:06] mavericks312: blizz is never getting rid of addons
[8:39:15] Mecabeast: what's really impressive is the guild that cleared vanilla nax with no deaths mc through nax

[8:39:23] kokochris: @soge131 everquest.  and AC was asherons call. Great games at their time. but dated to hell now (AC no longer exists :( )
[8:39:25] Mylamage: hardcore raiding and pvp definitely takes you out of that casual spectrum depending on how hard you go in it
[8:39:27] Ensanee: @91Niki lol did u ban that guy?
[8:39:36] BlewGamingGroup: @Sarocus .... i need bags   :)

[8:39:38] soge131: Oh, I see
[8:39:44] steelyn: Hardcore or waste 19hrs to farm, I’d rather be called a casual. Fk that noise lmao I don’t have enough time for that
[8:39:45] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I came from City of Heroes before WoW. When you died, you accrused XP debt and you couldn't earn anymore XP until that debt was removed from stuff that gave XP. At max level, currency earned went towards XP debt. So if you died a lot, your money making took a hit.
[8:39:55] notdustinx: Luxthos gonna have a hell of a time make his WA for DF lol
[8:39:56] Laelas_sm: new ui just means you dont HAVE to use elvui or others

[8:41:11] tacovendor_45: the towliee laugh in his rewards is awesome
[8:41:12] Joren456: question about retail from a newb, after you hit the level cap, what is the next thing you should be doing from there
[8:41:14] Rottencoarse: never lol?
[8:41:17] freetherocktv: @Rudric_Ice Guild Wars was out before WoW, do you mean GW2?
[8:41:22] kokochris: @LtDanAndHisMagicLegs ah man.  I came from asherons call Darktide PVP.  It was hell on earth.  You dropped some items on death.  It was brutal, but had its charm
[8:41:23] MoonChocolates: @Towelliee You think WoW would have died if they never had pvp. I think thats the main attraction of the game. Faction vs Faction. I wish FF14 had opposing factions instead of everybody hugging and kissing each other. LUL
[8:41:28] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: hes moved on from 100% wow for sure

[8:49:49] LeGoogs: Ashes is going to drop and theyll realize that the game isnt sustainable without PVE like what happened in NW. @Towelliee
[8:49:49] bloodogg35: im hoping to be dead by then
[8:50:00] mark20059: the new race looks horrid
[8:50:01] freetherocktv: @Towelliee AION had aerial PVP
[8:50:08] LawzenzOfficial: World of Warcraft .. since the announced that alliance and horde can group up for dungeons.. They've made the game "World of Craft" and even crafting isn't that good <.<
[8:50:09] striger221: wildstar was great but wow was too big at the time for it to survive
[8:50:13] EpicJune: loads of mmos to play
[8:50:18] Joren456: great! i will be able to play ashes and star citizen in 2068
[8:50:18] RocketvanPersie: agreed @striger221

[8:51:29] Belasard: was swg already down when wrath came out?
[8:51:33] Roaringkittylol: Social media was just starting up back then. WoW back in those days served as THE social experience ontop of being an RPG
[8:51:35] Glynn11: or be like antonio brown and whip out the D

[8:52:20] ic3k0ld: Rift was fun and had good potential, at first

[8:57:26] Greybeard_ttv: is it exalted for the good shoulder enchant?
[8:57:30] SauceFu: @Glynn11 The story and music in game is amazing. Be warner, the MSQ is hundreds of hours long
[8:57:34] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I've seen 3 druids camped at that spot
[8:57:40] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Like it's the TLPD
[8:57:40] F33NIXcs: @Towelliee Do you play Human?

[8:59:08] SauceFu: @Glynn11 Agreed. It gates you though, if you hit max level for an expansion you cannot move to the next expansion until you complete the MSQ
[8:59:29] syotos00: Do you play Druid
[8:59:35] Glynn11: @SauceFu the only thing that seems weird to me is the whole job system rather than clean cut classes
[8:59:35] WhiteKnight74648: 30-40 person que when i log
[8:59:36] RocketvanPersie: lost ark

[9:03:36] akaari5486: i just came in and hear you say about riot mmo,i guess wow died for the 456th time?
[9:03:41] PatrickKaneIsGoat: we dont even have any info on the riot mmo
[9:03:46] LawzenzOfficial: i just watched a youtube video of someone talking about the "new" crafting in dragonflight.. and i must say i'm looking forward to it.. but i still don't get why they don't do something with crafting for instance with mithril so you have to mix old and new ressources to make something
[9:03:47] Tscopez97: i mean hell if its good they will lose that in NA and EU too

[9:08:39] tedol: @Gingerprimer  at this point, they don't need
[9:08:42] Lazugo: the game director for riots MMO is not ghostcrawler. Is mark yetter https://twitter.com/markyetter ghostcraweler is VP ED
[9:08:51] DudeTheMoose: Starcitizen syndrome
[9:08:54] Karbonn: Is Ashes doesn't launch by 2024, in my opinion, it's failed and no longer relevant. It'll be too late.
[9:08:57] Karbonn: If*
[9:08:59] Collected1: oh easily
[9:08:59] NaBNez: i honestly agree with u
[9:09:01] ShadoodHD: "do you want next-gen graphics with higher hardware cost?"
[9:09:01] MR_WYTE: That would be a huge mistake.
[9:09:01] tedol: @Towelliee  next unreal will be with next gen consoles, so 3+ years more

[9:09:13] Longiboi: Isnt riot mmo like 4-5 years+ away
[9:09:20] Wulfgrym: Riot mmo is going to be so lit
[9:09:20] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30. 3-4 Day Mini-Thon for Launch. Gonna hit Max Level and get some quick gear!
[9:09:21] Se7enthSinn: the world is already done in the Riot Mmo
[9:09:21] sircheex: they have been
[9:09:27] Alaquane: When did Riot hire ghostcrawler?
[9:09:32] sircheex: they announced a ton of projects the year they announced project a (valorant)
[9:09:33] MammothGB: I'm not expecting the riot MMO til 2024 at the very least, but more likely 25/26
[9:09:35] tedol: we don't know what engine they are using
[9:09:35] Lazugo: yeah valorant was announced on january and and launched in august
[9:09:52] RiggsTorvak: riots seems too mainstream to be any challenge
[9:09:56] Blah206: PogChamp
[9:10:01] MrKhanes: One thing for sure is that Riot MMO will be out before Star Citizen! Thats what i belive :D @Towelliee
[9:10:07] Akoudadis: Yeah probably thats how its going to go down
[9:10:10] TompsonX: @RiggsTorvak ?
[9:10:10] RocketvanPersie: we will get to play some sort of alpha/beta at the end of 2023 im guessing, with the full launch in 2024
[9:10:21] Karbonn: Ashes needs some kind of open-ish beta next year. If not, it'll fade away.
[9:10:25] RiggsTorvak: like youll just faceroll it all solo
[9:10:26] tedol: @RiggsTorvak  they have enough money to make any stupid things
[9:10:31] Wulfgrym: star citizen will be out around 2122
[9:10:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: first day back at work since wrath launch ugh
[9:10:35] TheRavenGrave: But that Might be the point. All That Effort to Hype up Ashes and nothing. which I think is sad.
[9:10:36] TompsonX: @RiggsTorvak Like World of Warcraft?
[9:10:38] akaari5486: so wow will die for the 465th time when riot mmo launches
[9:10:49] Collected1: so what's this Egypt theme in New World?
[9:10:50] Blah206: What comes out first between gta6, riot, ashes
[9:10:50] EpicJune: jesus SC been like 9 years no or somthing>

[9:11:00] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: towCopium
[9:11:01] xmirrxrs: Use it to amke titansteel and sell it while its still good gold
[9:11:01] Akoudadis: Dont think riot mmo will challenge wow. its going to have its own community
[9:11:03] Mecabeast: probably titan steel bar cds are going for like  100-200g for a cd
[9:11:10] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: HOLY towCopium
[9:11:11] ProClicker: GTA 6 is another game that looks several years away
[9:11:12] MR_WYTE: I want WoW to be comfy/cozy in 10 years like Runescape/EQ is today.
[9:11:13] rsimpson105: as we saw last year, wow will only die if it kills itself
[9:11:14] Karbonn: Only WoW can kill WoW LUL
[9:11:14] ItsDerpDiggler: We found out last year that even WoW can't kill WoW... So most likely no LUL
[9:11:19] Wulfgrym: Riot also has an amazing lore already in place
[9:11:36] Wulfgrym: so they got lots to work with
[9:11:38] MammothGB: At least an MMO will force Riot to sort out its lore for Runterra
[9:11:39] ShadoodHD: not to mention their league of legends universe, perfect place to make an MMO from
[9:11:39] ItsDerpDiggler: @Karbonn Nah... Last year taught us that even WoW can't kill itself lol
[9:11:44] Blah206: wow is immortal
[9:11:45] Mourningztar: Riot already has a fully flushed out world. so all they need to do is build around it
[9:11:50] SkymasterLz: at least WoW is immune to F2P strategy :P (I hope)
[9:11:54] Karbonn: @iAmDerpDiggler it sure did try though
[9:11:58] jboykillems: Hello @towelliee been a long time since I’ve popped. Glad to see you’re still around. How are you liking WOTLK classic?
[9:12:02] Wulfgrym: wow is the chuck norris of mmos
[9:12:02] ShadoodHD: hell they did Arcane and it's one of my favorite shows even now
[9:12:03] Blah206: overwatch went f2p before wow did
[9:12:06] Gingerprimer: Amazing lore is quite a stretch ngl  thye have good wourld building that is it

[9:12:45] Nitemareforu: Oh yeah they have so much lore
[9:12:48] Blah206: @Whoracle1337 hell yeah
[9:12:49] 91Niki: I can't wait to have more than one MMO to play HYPERS
[9:12:50] im_capy: or when bad news about BLizz comes our and everyone plays FFXIV
[9:12:57] Lify: What server are you on?
[9:12:58] DarthWrex: The LoL Netflix show was pretty good
[9:13:01] RiggsTorvak: alot tried Aion
[9:13:13] freetherocktv: @Towelliee do you think they will ever expand the free to play level 20 for wow?
[9:13:21] Se7enthSinn: Also, the Netflix Series is did very very well. Lots of non-league people watched it.

[9:13:26] TompsonX: Level 50 should be f2p imo
[9:13:27] WhiteKnight74648: @Towelliee you going to continue the msq eventually?
[9:13:32] TompsonX: keep those early dungeons alive
[9:13:37] Wulfgrym: Riot is a separate beast IMO
[9:13:38] CruzM8: I got flamed from so many people here when i said leage had a lot of lore back wghen we were talking about this topic a while back
[9:13:46] Whoracle1337: the WoW devs will play the riot mmo
[9:13:53] Blah206: yup
[9:13:57] MoonChocolates: As toxic as League of Legends is I can imagine how the chat will be in Riot MMO
[9:13:59] im_capy: I think Blizz is hoping they can revive Diablo as a franchise to then have 2 mmos to complete with
[9:14:03] TompsonX: I would be happy for WoW gamepass
[9:14:06] akaari5486: im playing wow since tbc mostly because of lore,music and all that fantasy that reminds me of lotr
[9:14:11] Wulfgrym: i don't want it to kill wow, i just want to see other good mmos
[9:14:21] Blah206: a riot mmo will only help wow
[9:14:25] Sir_Cranium: Bruh WoW being added to GamePass would be a Chad move
[9:14:26] Dreadfrost: @Wulfgrym yea i couldnt agree more
[9:14:26] tedol: right, they can hold for game pass for Riot MMO
[9:14:27] ThickCityBish: they will probably have wow on game pass and playable with x box to counter roit mmo

[9:14:40] Blah206: LOL
[9:14:44] Wulfgrym: im just speaking in general, it would be gerat to see more mmos do well
[9:14:53] Wulfgrym: yeah that would be a big OOF on Blizzards part
[9:14:56] Odinslayer: riot mmo gonna be a F2P play i guess
[9:14:58] Rudric_Ice: and they will
