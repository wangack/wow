Currently the second stack applied seems to bug and apply a 100% damage reduction (more like 99% in practice) meaning a single DK in your group can make the entire trash or boss do almost no damage for 10 seconds.

[3:31:42] beacon000: @Towelliee I was watching a dk tank yesterday that had a druid only do like 3.5K dps overall and the tanks embelishment did 3.25K overall dps.   lol
[3:31:47] daconcion: @Wcvechten Which really sucks considering healer DPS is very relevant in high keys
[3:31:59] DunzoCD: i always find its the key owner who is way below on dps lol

[4:24:52] daconcion: If a class interests you, play it. It will be viable to play at max level in some capacity. Even then, Blizz isn't going to let 1 or 2 classes sit as unplayable for long, they will update classes. What is good now won't be good forever and what is bad won't be bad forever. Just play the class that interests you
