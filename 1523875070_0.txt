[1:47:02] cappei: He's gonna play 2 hours before it's back to react Randy content
[1:47:03] duffluv22: Beta drove me nuts. I opted out for SL beta because I couldn't stand the bugs
[1:47:04] temp3st98: @TheMapleKitKat he said if the alpha dropped he would play it
[1:47:06] tedol: what happened?
[1:47:13] emznev: @DallDK same have to give props of how good his youtube videos are
[1:47:18] mayonaes: I have used the default ui since 2005
[1:47:21] lumaday: actually real excited to play with the revamped UI
[1:47:33] onyqs: are they gonna have DKs as they were implemented or as they were balanced toward the end?
[1:47:34] NieIas: his chat is very divided now because he has alot of ff14/lostark/wow andies
[1:47:37] feherlofia123: im stoked about the reveal of all talents. messing around with them was really fun
[1:47:38] Turet78: and also gonna complain for not listening to the community but I not seen him sending even one feedback in game
[1:47:55] ColdIceCreamMan: my current UI is so cluttered and slows my game. i'm really glad that i can throw out some dead weight
[1:47:57] MillerrSP: the default actionbars feel so clunky idk
[1:48:33] DrellokTV: you can disable those tho?
[1:48:37] feherlofia123: im sure i will adapt to a new UI but i peefer default tbh
[1:48:37] KaisenSiru: Gryphons Pog
[1:48:37] temp3st98: i like them
[1:48:39] DrkPhoenix6913: you can turn them off
[1:48:39] ColdIceCreamMan: i dont use elvui for the hotbars but the million other features
[1:48:39] temp3st98: :)
[1:48:42] tedol: they looks diablo like
[1:48:43] rbolude: I like them :c
[1:48:45] Sarocus: you can disable them, right?
[1:48:45] MadWolf1290: it was a Diablo omage at first
[1:48:46] DrkPhoenix6913: (or at least today you can)
[1:48:46] mayonaes: ya, i always ran the macro to remove the gryphons
[1:48:50] kunqq147: love them
[1:48:51] zysmos: is the new ui as customisable tho ?
[1:48:56] Consaa: Sarocus through macro
[1:49:00] Madfrak: i have an addon wich removes them so i play with default ui just without gryphons
[1:49:02] SphinxyOCE: you can disable them in new UI so thats fine
[1:49:03] Consaa: or addon
[1:49:03] BlewGamingGroup: just let me stack em in the middle of the screen
[1:49:04] NieIas: atleast horde will have wyvern now
[1:49:06] Turet78: I'm using default with Vuhdo for healing and Plater for nameplates and I'm fine so the new UI is a blessing for me
[1:49:09] rbolude: i think at some point they show it without them or say u can hide them
[1:49:16] generaljosh721: They made them more of a focus lol
[1:49:21] tronbadgames: cleaned up for sure
[1:49:26] Spaede: Default ui reminds me of Internet Explorer lol. Maybe the new one will be like Microsoft Edge, to bad we‚Äôll all just download Chrome (elvui)
[1:49:27] pronkk_: if we can move things around like in elv with the new ui, ill drop elv
[1:49:32] thatsnobueno58: The dk would prob be adequate. also you excited for LK prot? Best the spec ever was imo
[1:49:35] mayonaes: There is an image withoiut the gryphons
[1:49:36] tedol: lol. they looks worse
[1:49:39] ExpectDragons: think they should add the Dragonflight UI changes to classic so less need for addons? optional?
[1:49:39] Araphas: looks pretty meh
[1:49:40] ColdIceCreamMan: modern-ish
[1:49:41] mayonaes: so you can hide them
[1:49:47] tronbadgames: i think it looks worse tbh. looks unfinished
[1:49:48] Thoreya: im sure they polished it more since 3 months ago
[1:49:51] KaisenSiru: They updaded it. And if you're Horde, they become Wyvryn now
[1:49:52] neugassh: looks terrible
[1:50:00] uzury: yeah you'll be able to hide it
[1:50:03] Turet78: YOu can remove the griphons if you want
[1:50:07] uzury: w/o gimmicks
[1:50:11] Volatilestyle: its not going to matter if you can see your hp bar when you get one shotted
[1:50:12] lumaday: boom baby
[1:50:14] Thoreya: thats much beter
[1:50:16] Thoreya: without the eagle
[1:50:18] temp3st98: and they gave something else for horde players
[1:50:18] feherlofia123: why change something that slready works
[1:50:21] flebbooo: Everything seems moveable
[1:50:21] ColdIceCreamMan: bigger minimap KreyGasm
[1:50:22] emznev: i like the new ui tbh seems decent
[1:50:26] NieIas: can finally get rid of elvui
[1:50:28] neugassh: its pretty clean
[1:50:29] DrkPhoenix6913: youve been able to turn them off for a long time now (but not sure if you can in wrath or not)
[1:50:32] lumaday: Can't wait to play with it
[1:50:32] chrslp: That does look nicer
[1:50:33] magakigr: the new UI looks good without having to rely on addons
[1:50:42] chrslp: Looks a lot cleaner
[1:50:42] Laudrana: I really don't like it. Might be because I've used the current UI for 15 years. Maybe it takes time to get used to it.
[1:50:50] TheZofren: I love the new UI it's so slick, hoping it'll help me convince my friends to play
[1:51:00] zgag: The Ui that almost prevented Towelliee from entering Shadowlands
[1:51:03] Trexxter: does the UI look as smooth in 1080p?
[1:51:22] rbolude: i mostly wonder how the party/raid frames gonna be like
[1:51:27] buddybeerbruh: Remaking UI displaying more information for the user is first steps to start to lower the need for addons and eventually banning all addons @Towelliee
[1:51:28] lucid_wow: the new ui looks nice and very functional for new players but i think ill stick to elvui personally
[1:51:29] Kriven: Good morning all Sup T Money
[1:51:30] thatsnobueno58: prot can solo some N dungeons lol
[1:51:31] emznev: XD

[1:51:37] NieIas: Kappa
[1:51:42] EpicBananners: are there more images of the new UI?
[1:51:43] tedol: they used way to much soft colours
[1:51:44] szble: or tomorrow
[1:51:47] precision79: they should use that new UI for classic too. Its literally a change that doesnt change anything pretty much :D
[1:51:49] temp3st98: i dont like normal ui so i have an addon to make it how it was before bfa
[1:51:49] flebbooo: he knows POGGERS
[1:51:56] KutzTV: Where did we get the idea that Alpha hits this week?
[1:51:59] George2001k: Alpha today, for sure.

[3:04:37] EldarionDK: @nowaayjose Sp is no no is wotlk
[3:04:39] galixx24: how does prot pally feel in heroics?
[3:04:40] pazta9: @apb89 its wrath
[3:05:00] Aquadriel: old kindom was probably the most dangerous dungeon with those pulls at the start. Those spiders that casted some nasty shadowbolt
[3:05:02] apb89: Need to make them cata level
[3:05:05] ghost186_: Wraith is easy lol
[3:05:12] ghost186_: Wraith was much easier than TBC
[3:05:24] apb89: Yah I played wrath and it was super easy. They need to make everything more difficult in my opinion
[3:05:25] leo599: I remember it was harder
[3:05:26] HaloS23: @Towelliee I think there was a portal for that in Legion Dal but not sure for Wrath Dal
[3:05:34] apb89: #somechanges
[3:05:47] amazulu_: except for DK :(
[3:05:54] player2two: when the big spider bug its hard
[3:05:59] amazulu_: rip blood dps
[3:06:01] Alienfromger: #makewowhardagain Kappa
[3:06:05] thingkin: 3.3.5 boomy buff Kreygasm
[3:06:17] ghost186_: Black Temple was much similar to Wrath
[3:06:20] Nachozdood: we have to remember that Blizz making dungeons easier back then was because alot of players were hot garbo
[3:06:24] Velashen: I don‚Äôt like that they use the last patch for each classic expansion. They are all cake easy at the end. So many buffs.
[3:06:37] apb89: That‚Äôs why I actually enjoyed cata dungeons. Till every1 cried to get them nerfed

[3:06:57] Calphurnious: @Nachozdood harder doesn't make it better tho
[3:07:14] apb89: They should make entire expansion harder #somechanges
[3:07:21] Nachozdood: @Nachozdood with that same logic making it easier dosent make it better
[3:07:25] MurlisWoW: Heroics in the start of classic tbc were a pain in the ass
[3:07:31] pazta9: @apb89 yea i loved start of cata
[3:07:35] player2two: harder doesnt make it funner true
[3:07:38] Templexx: whats the highest level you can start for free in wrath classic?
[3:07:40] tronbadgames: that sounds like a problem they shouldn't create
[3:07:44] apb89: More difficulty is more fun to me actually
[3:07:51] pazta9: ^^
[3:07:52] apb89: Requires me to play better
[3:07:54] UniquePerson08: heroic +1  heroic +2 scale then. i wouldnt really mind
[3:07:56] Aquadriel: that mushroom boss was annoying af
[3:08:10] tronbadgames: they'll have to throw in catch up stuff etc, typical blizz style create a problem instead of a solution
[3:08:23] Nachozdood: they should just add a mythic lvl to the dungeons for those that want more of a challenge
[3:08:34] Foserious: @Templexx you'll have to clarify your question. Do you mean free as in non-sub? Because you need a sub to play classic. If you mean without a boost you start at level 1, would need a 55 character to make a DK
[3:08:34] Velashen: Most people don‚Äôt want to stream roll everything right up front.
[3:08:38] Kale_Nd: they should just create a mythic difficulty for dungeons
[3:08:40] BlewGamingGroup: mythic wrath tuning inc
[3:08:43] Dystilled: An appropriate level of difficulty is always more fun. Was actually disheartening downing a progression boss after a 5% nerf
[3:08:52] player2two: i dont think i can get into wow anymore. i used to be so addicted but now i cant get myself to level a toon
[3:08:56] apb89: Like actually make heroic content‚Ä¶. Heroic. Then keep it that way. Adding mythic doesn‚Äôt make sense for wrath imo
[3:09:11] TacticalByte: will max TBC characters be able to just hop into Wrath without extra cost? Didn't Blizz make you pay for classic > TBC characters or something?
[3:10:01] EldarionDK: Mix of both
[3:10:04] Nachozdood: @TacticalByte the only payment needed is a sub fee
[3:10:04] amazulu_: that's a known bug. should not allow sub-80 players in heroics.
[3:10:05] pazta9: @tacticalbyte nope, no extra cost
[3:10:15] Foserious: @TacticalByte You can clone your characters for free in one direction. The only $ you have to pay is the sub
[3:10:16] scenario17: it would suck for casual or new players if they scale heroics to be hard
[3:10:24] BlewGamingGroup: if they allow sub level 80s in ... people are going to boost the shit out of that
[3:10:30] apb89: That‚Äôs what normal dungeons are for then
[3:10:34] Exusprime: if i remember these are the only potentially spicy packs in here
[3:10:48] Sir_Sophisticus: You could go into heroics pre-70 in TBC, it seems inended almost?
[3:10:53] BericTV: Mornin‚Äô all and @towelliee
[3:10:54] apb89: The idea of heroic content is to work hard and push yourself to complete content
[3:10:54] amazulu_: https://github.com/JamminL/wotlk-classic-bugs/issues/116
[3:11:01] Foserious: @roadrrunnerr1 They are implementing xp nerfs for level differences as far as I'm aware but I agree lol

[3:11:10] apb89: What we are watching now is normal feeling content
[3:11:10] Aidler: a min ilvl requirement, if that‚Äôs possible in wrath, would be an idea
[3:11:17] raye_gaming22: this has to be buffed some what
[3:11:19] Exusprime: Wheres the patrol?
[3:11:23] pazta9: @apb89 exactly, normal dungeons for casual players heroics for hardcore players it just make sense that its hard
[3:11:43] Kale_Nd: Any idea if more invite waves have gone out for wotlk ?
[3:11:46] BoezIRL: BoezIRL subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 62 months! -7
[3:11:46] player2two: wrath is so easy compared to shadowlands
[3:12:10] Foserious: I don't really remember Wrath heroics being difficult either way
[3:12:11] mavericks312: @player2two there 1 in the same
[3:12:15] amazulu_: @Kale_Nd some people in LFG channel on beta said yesterday that they had just gotten in
[3:12:30] amazulu_: dunno if they were trolling or perhaps had not noticed they had access
[3:12:32] Nachozdood: @player2two LOL and why wouldnt it be the game has evolved for more then 10 years at this point from what wrath was
[3:12:34] Thdlock: i did a dungeon with some friends and we 4 manned it and aoe packs died in like 5 sec KEKW
[3:12:44] SensationalBanana: I only remember the ICC Heroic dungeons being a bit of a challenge, the rest were pushover content from the start.

[3:13:15] Exusprime: @SensationalBanana yea Halls of Reflection was challenging
[3:13:17] Foserious: @SensationalBanana I agree
[3:13:28] Yofappafappa: what was that dungeon where the LK chased you through it, for some reason i remember that one being a pain
[3:13:29] ghost186_: What is the correct balance though? People say retail mythic is to hard and classic is to easy. Is the balance somewhere in between?
[3:13:45] thekl0wn2: Are they gonna let people boost blood elves in wrath?
[3:13:57] rnh_silky: @Yofappafappa Halls of Reflection,
[3:13:59] pazta9: @ghost186_ yes
[3:14:01] Nachozdood: @thekl0wn2 yes the only thing you cant boost is a DK
[3:14:19] raye_gaming22: @SensationalBanana the only dungeon that was some what compareble to a mythic +0 was halls of reflection
[3:14:30] apb89: @ghost186_ that‚Äôs what blizzard has been trying to figure out for almost 20 years lol. I guess mythic+ is best solution came up with so far, in my opinion
[3:14:46] buffkenobi: @Towelliee post nerf CE gang last night, I can finally quit x.x
[3:14:47] rnh_silky: Fated raid may be the new wave tbh

[3:15:38] player2two: pit of sauron or whatever was annoying too

[3:38:34] Handfoot: they literally just got 100 employees for retail lol
[3:38:34] Nachozdood: they should just do what project ascension has been doing adding new spells/talents and new boss mechanics
[3:38:43] Reserk: Aslong as Ulduar is out longer than it was current
[3:38:44] AlphasaurusRexx: put those teams on retail?

[3:39:23] Thoreya: 95% sure theres 2 different teams

[4:47:09] Shiekrunner: i think it should just be seen as a history of wow expansions rather than classic
[4:47:09] shmokindoink: yeah nah wrath is still far better than retail will ever be
[4:47:19] tricky_86: lol
[4:47:19] schneid4: again, gdkp's themselves arent the problem. its the rampant gold buying
[4:47:21] TompsonX: Isn't that what they wanted? To goof around and socialize?
[4:47:24] Maydie6066: @Towelliee  at the rate its going, Blizzard will keep the "classic" into all its re-releases, get ready for Legion, but without any modern features so it can feel "classic"
[4:47:26] primeutopia: at the rate they are going it will be retail really soon tho heh
[4:47:29] Cryttan: Well the difnition of classic definetely isn't hard. So I don't think the difficulty matters too much
[4:47:47] ghost186_: Esfand said yesterday the most fun he has ever had in wow is TBC classic in its current state

[4:49:18] primeutopia: wrath was peak wow.. .they made the whole game child proof... Cata started the decline by giving everyone everything -- Monty haulish you get an ashbringer, you get an ashbringer, you get an ashbringer
[4:49:31] Tdoh__: fav xpac?
[4:49:31] Cryttan: I personally enjoy facerolling dungeons and getting the hard content in raids. Probably why I never liked M+
[4:49:32] shmokindoink: are u a legion is the best expac andy?
[4:49:40] tricky_86: I woul play the hell out of Cata Classic. Its slept on, dope raids we just got stuck to Dragon Soul for a year so people 'thought it sucked. In a "Classic" version it would be fun.
[4:49:44] schneid4: sunwell is kinda hard
[4:49:47] rockout80: I don't judge Wrath by the dungeons.. The raids are what I think makes it
[4:49:57] shmokindoink: sunwell is def hard
[4:50:00] asmodai4823: half the wrath raids sucked
[4:50:13] drunko998: was the right amount of dumbing down. Cata took it too far
[4:50:15] notColt45: If they could "fix" cata, what would people want?
[4:50:16] ghost186_: @asmodai4823 So true
[4:50:28] ExziledSoul: i think your BOS fell off
[4:50:29] The_Boctor: @tricky_86 i tell everyone the same thing
[4:50:30] Shiekrunner: cata is great
[4:50:41] Nachozdood: @Towelliee remember back when they said that the Lichking would be the final wow boss at lvl 100? this was on the wrath collectors dvd
[4:50:41] Aquadriel: @notColt45 keep the dungeons hard and scale them up with every patch.
[4:50:44] smashwow: the shitty end to DS would be a start.
[4:50:45] Cryttan: Wrath is where PvP got a bigh overhaul and actually became fun imo.
[4:50:48] TheCliffyShow: I didn't even fight Lich King during the expansion. What does that say about the guilds I was in.
[4:51:08] smashwow: most people think of cata and go fuck it because of DS or how hard the heroics were at launch
[4:51:17] larochej: would.d you say that wrath is a good point to stop the "classic" releases?
[4:51:24] zeitgeiz: Surely we get some sort of update on DF today right? Crazy how slow info is trickling out
[4:51:33] Th3spy: he just wants the rep is all good lol
[4:51:41] DeanoTV: alot of people want MoP classic rather than cata
[4:51:44] amazulu_: naxx not open
[4:52:00] The_Boctor: not if you kill bigglesworth Kappa
[4:52:01] schneid4: yeah go straight panada expac skip cata
[4:52:10] primeutopia: dont think they opened NAX yet... could be done tho
[4:52:16] Todd99: I liked Cata wayyyyy more than MoP
[4:52:17] zeitgeiz: Lol
[4:52:23] SethLan: gyf
[4:52:28] Cryttan: I would personally play up untill Cata and after that I would most likely quit classic or maybe restart from TBC again if possible.
[4:52:29] asmodai4823: pre nerf cata would be fun
[4:52:29] Aquadriel: the copium this week is off the charts
[4:52:29] ColdIceCreamMan: it's called GIF :^)
[4:52:37] Nachozdood: 1st part of pandaland was garbo
[4:52:37] smashwow: a gote?
[4:52:43] paperzino: chances of alpha today?
[4:52:50] love_eggplant: 0
[4:52:54] BoezIRL: it's gif
[4:52:55] zeitgeiz: I don‚Äôt know if it is copying at this point. Just doesn‚Äôt make sense to not even give people art or something
[4:53:05] Kriven: lirikEat
[4:53:20] zeitgeiz: They are riding very low hype waves with the spacing and pacing of content
[4:53:21] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee morning sir, hows the beta going?
[4:53:28] nvnto: people saying jiff eat icecream with a fork. IonJam
[4:53:31] kamisengames: no oculus
[4:53:33] TheCliffyShow: I liked Occulus.
[4:53:36] primeutopia: Do all, but do occulus at the end lol
[4:53:36] OceanManCarter: Oculus is my all time favorite WoW dungeon
[4:53:41] primeutopia: keep a the pain triain runnig
[4:53:43] fadedshadow50: @Towelliee hey, how are you using both seal of command and vengeance?
[4:53:54] Kevoskillz: @Towelliee is Naxx the only raid will be live when wrath comes out?
[4:53:55] Zvent90: Oculus takes like 10 mins whats not to like
[4:53:59] BlewGamingGroup: you only liked it til you got what you needed and then never did it again
[4:54:00] ghost186_: Esfand said yesterday the most fun he has ever had in wow is TBC classic in its current state
[4:54:01] kamisengames: @TheCliffyShow you like pain?
[4:54:03] gentlemannnnnnnnn: you only did oculus the couple of times you needed to. But it definitly sucked.
[4:54:06] 91Niki: People still arguing the gif vs jif conversation in 2022 LUL
[4:54:07] TheBroCrow: enjoying the game? Madge
[4:54:13] smashwow: look sometimes people have to plow a 4 to appreciate a 10 @Towelliee
[4:54:13] Lasidor: OCC takes 10 minutes? youre crazy lol
[4:54:14] YNR_Chewmiester: i wish I wasn't so busy with work, barely been able to play. Wrath had my best memories since I was full time raiding then before real life got busy.
[4:54:15] Warcraft_Whims: Get used to Oculus because were going to have a lot of those dragon riding dungeons in Dragonflight
[4:54:17] TheCliffyShow: I like stuff with vehicles.
[4:54:19] nathyrocka123: wotlk is the best game of all time
[4:54:20] Nachozdood: slzSmash slzSmash slzSmash slzSmash  you liked Occulus!!!  slzWave
[4:54:25] primeutopia: the verticality, once folks know the vehicle mechanics Occulus is REALLY simple
[4:54:30] Cryttan: I don't like them buffing it, keep it easymode
[4:54:43] Fidibus89: @fadedshadow50 it¬¥s a bug in the beta
[4:55:01] ArroArroArro: also way fewer options for good online games back than, so if you had a good guild/friend group wow was go to
[4:55:09] smashlord4000: the wait paid of though
[4:55:16] zeitgeiz: Oculus was pretty fun if you had a full group of friends/guildies
[4:55:21] xternalwolf: to be fair they didnt like occ because they had no idea where to go
[4:55:21] Nachozdood: i remember healers who couldnt do the dragon fights cause Ma addons dun work
[4:55:40] fadedshadow50: @fadedshadow50 ah okay, thank you
[4:55:41] confl1ct10n: There were so many other raids to do at that time, OS, And VoA
[4:55:48] racketpunch: were prot palis always mana starved?
[4:55:57] smashlord4000: but I never understood the whole Cataclysm thing after ICC
[4:56:03] FerociouzMonk: all these epics
[4:56:06] Cryttan: 1 Expansion lasting 3 years, 1 year per raid. THey can do it bro. Don't underestimate them.
[4:56:18] erdls: pretty sure we are getting patches a month faster average now thx to new employees

[4:56:44] primeutopia: do the daily
[4:56:48] Egzolinas: Oh that loading screen with Arthas. <3
[4:57:05] confl1ct10n: I want to see Obsidian sanctum.
[4:57:17] Nachozdood: @Towelliee whats your most ideal dungeon grinding group? i know its all easy and wont matter

[5:02:01] Nicstar1007: 6 Dungeons and so many items for you :)
[5:02:33] Obidal: Actually its quite likely the reason why they didn't add LFD/RFD is because otherwise you could do heroics multiple times a day and get geared faster...
[5:02:37] smashwow: and in 3.3.5 it was battle groups right?
[5:03:07] Obidal: True
[5:03:13] ArcaneSyntax: that's not true the dungeon finder was always cross realm, it's in the patch notes for 3.3
[5:03:17] Shadowlemur01: yeah @smashwow
[5:03:36] ArcaneSyntax: 3.3 it was within battlegroups, but cross realm for sure.
[5:03:39] ForklyftTV: and you need a few days of running to dungeons to get the ilvl to use LFD
[5:03:41] Mandingoss: !alpha
[5:03:41] Moobot: @Mandingoss PREDICTION JULY 14th | WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-internal-alpha-now-on-blizzard-catalogue-327322 | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[5:03:56] nickelius: They should really add LFD atleast for 1-79 content. Would make leveling much more fun
[5:04:15] Havoc_S1: !soon
[5:04:16] Moobot: @Havoc_S1 it usually takes ~45 mins after going live to start. its been 05:04:21 since he went live. grab some snacks or go do something, the stream will start soon‚Ñ¢
[5:04:22] truxcat: @nickelius even 15-68 would be great
[5:04:31] TheCliffyShow: Battlegroups, remember those?
[5:04:37] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee I think it was same server on the PTR though for a bit?
[5:04:49] Shadowlemur01: do they not use battle groups anymore?
[5:04:57] Theliahh: nope
[5:05:07] razizs: LUL

[5:05:40] ForklyftTV: ooo you got Crest! Love that shield!
[5:05:41] ChrisMFCook: serious question, have you looked into rested xp's prepatch guide? and do you think its worth it?
[5:05:51] paperzino: this dungeon is great
[5:05:53] YNR_Chewmiester: hell yeah! Keep the sweat lords away from my quest mobs
[5:06:06] nickelius: Hows your gear like Mr towel
[5:06:16] Aquadriel: theres some big legs or boots here if i remember
[5:06:36] silodin: i realy think paid xp guides are such a scam. leveling is not hard, it never was hard. worst case you're a few hours behind.
[5:06:54] Shadowlemur01: The occulus was the worst
[5:06:58] sshadeh: @silodin ye
[5:07:04] Nokterian: that part can go bad LUL
[5:07:17] Meddok: hey do you think we will have GS or ilvl in wotlk?
[5:07:18] Theliahh: yeah the advantage of hitting 80 a few hours/1 day earlier is basically nil unless you're going for literal world first clears
[5:07:21] ChrisMFCook: @silodin i'm just trying to debate if $10 to get a that first level out the way is worth it to get ahead
[5:07:42] ijuki: @chrismfcook no, it is not
[5:07:49] Aquadriel: prefoxy got bitchslapped

[6:39:37] DeanoTV: @jjoohhs true

[6:39:42] Sielu11628: From the interviews, they have an entire team working on world content and Dragon Riding is meant to be pretty big
[6:39:43] Weedweed: Maybe the game shouldn‚Äôt be tailored for twitch streamers who no life wow 20 hours a day
[6:39:52] Jindo_ZG: AP wasnt what gave Legion longevity
[6:39:58] spalkin: You're missing Sanc buff rip mana
[6:40:02] ursinealli: The grind of AP is not what I liked about Legion. What I liked about Legion was there was a reason to play other classes because of the different stories that went with class halls. They tried to replicate that with covenants and was no where near as good.
[6:40:07] WoWRoach: I get bored with the repetitive grind and created alts.  Don't think I even maxed out my neck artifact power.
[6:40:08] metavahn231: WoW's story is so short and boring you just skip it, you need books to get a full story
[6:40:14] Korupcija_: AP was meaningless grind though
[6:40:16] Spec69: At laest Shadowlands allows me time to grind achievements etc, Legion and BFA kinda forced you to grind just AP and only AP if you wanted to stay cutting edge, SL lets me stay cutting edge and grind other stuff

[6:42:42] 770Cash: Azerite did not feel as good as artifact power
[6:42:46] raye_gaming22: 50% of the progress guild quit rading and went casual cuz they could not afford the mental grind
[6:42:48] Kulture1: i don't think theres any news
[6:42:48] Jindo_ZG: AP grinding is only as good as the content you do for it, Legion had better content
[6:43:01] svu3: artifact power felt rewarding at the start of legion.
[6:43:04] Zivs: i never had an issue with ap in bfa PrideShrug
[6:43:07] aribellae: What about Cata or MoP? Those were fun without an APish grind
[6:43:08] TacDuc: Making a game is so much trouble, with all the time and money spent on it

[6:43:22] HaloS23: @Towelliee saying "DF will be boring" at this point is cart before the horse. How can anyone say this when all we've seen is the teaser and 30 seconds if class/race intro

[6:43:46] grimmy17: bug @juniper549
[6:43:50] Lazugo: we go to her stream
[6:43:50] Holler_w: AP in legion was fine because it could be obtained just by playing thz game and it gave interesting rewards (until 9.2 at least). AP in BFA was bad because you were chasing the same boring traits over and over
[6:43:52] cahoots82: People don't want borrowed power but they also want new things to work towards each expansion...
[6:43:53] Cafe0le: SHE KNOWS POGGERS
[6:43:53] ChrisMFCook: but who wants to do that one all their alts
[6:43:55] Herzenliegen: I miss the island grind
[6:43:58] Bill666420: AP grind made playing alts feel terrrible
[6:44:14] Jindo_ZG: AP grinds are only ok when the content is good, Legion was way better than BFA and SL
[6:44:18] gelimarr: towieieie
[6:44:25] BattleKnoedel: it didnt for pet battles :)
[6:44:38] cahoots82: Looking back, I miss BFA. BFA's dungeons were just so much more fun than SL's
[6:44:42] svu3: Prefer power to come from gear tbh
[6:44:42] AlexIncorporated: It wasnt meaninglessness  but it wasthestart of boring daily chores
[6:44:44] raye_gaming22: @Bill666420 not terrable impossible unless it was 6.3+
[6:44:47] Kisswani: the fact that everything gave you a lego made every piece of content viable at all levels
[6:44:51] kerchuu: legion was a fantastic expac and artifact weapons were 10/10
[6:44:52] readyvic: Mop had farming pets timeless isle thats what we need back
[6:44:55] bowsers1: 8.2 and 8.3 were very fun imo

[6:45:16] raye_gaming22: thing is ppl were not happy with it
[6:45:16] spalkin: 8.3 would of been amazing if they didn't timegate corruption vendor
[6:45:20] Metket: they worked for legion more then bfa+shadowlands combined LUL

[6:45:38] neugassh: bfa KEKW
[6:45:41] danimoto10: more than legion?
[6:45:41] Rabiahtaro132: All of Legion I always had something to do even if it was working on alts.
[6:45:42] Nachozdood: didnt you have tons to do in cata? you rank that super low atleast you did the other day
[6:45:42] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[6:45:46] bowsers1: in 8.3 , if you played only 1 character , it was fun
[6:45:49] DeanoTV: corruption was so fun
[6:45:51] TacDuc: 8.3 was so much fun
[6:45:55] The_Farting_Spaniard: BFA? Oof
[6:45:55] toobaked1987: BFA was most excellent. Loved it!
[6:46:00] fillefaren: I honestly miss some grinds tbh

[6:46:07] 770Cash: I got a message about getting g the trivia right!
[6:46:09] mogzter: Legion was the best expansion in my eyes @towelliee
[6:46:10] duffluv22: Time gating...good or bad???
[6:46:10] ambiotic: see i had more alts then ever in 8.3, you did visions and the assualts and m+ that was it
[6:46:14] svu3: the systems were bad for alts
[6:46:19] MrSnekyDino: I miss Boralus. What a lively home city.
[6:46:20] gimmlay: BFA was a good ass expansion.
[6:46:23] tyluxtv: people put too much weight of an expansion on "how alt friendly was it" which is kind of bullshit. Wrath and Cata made alts too easy and required no work to get a 2nd character up to speed.
[6:46:25] Kinghorn: D:
[6:46:25] dthebugman: I loved bfa
[6:46:29] silodin: where is the trivia?!

[6:46:42] 770Cash: They ask for battlenet ID and say it will be flagged for next wave
[6:46:43] AlexIncorporated: I was too far behind when 8.3 launched lost interest in the chores quick

[6:46:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: ha i called it that there would be a diablo immortal update today LUL
[6:46:52] readyvic: We need gear free stuff to do mop ftw

[6:47:06] Kriven: they pouring that Towelliee swimming pool
[6:47:18] Metket: immortal news YAY
[6:47:25] c0mmander_starscream: Feed the grind
[6:47:27] Yofappafappa: story of life
[6:47:31] Broastbeef: The thing about AP grind was it needed to be to reward your time. Some days only having 2 hours to play, I wanted to play with Friends and M+ wasn‚Äôt worth the AP grind so you didn‚Äôt progress much. If it was equal to islands or WQ then sure, no problem!
[6:47:31] Kisswani: I hope we get old emmissaries back in DF . no more WQ 2.0 bullshit .
[6:47:55] raye_gaming22: if you would have to grind ap like we did you would not liek it too bro
[6:47:59] billybaroo1: tlpd farming Kappa
[6:48:04] Malvurak9109: That prot pally damage‚Ä¶.geez
[6:48:05] emznev: imagine playing an MMO and not wanting to grind for shit KEKW
[6:48:08] TacDuc: I didn't like mechagon, but pretty much all else in BfA was something I did and liked(also did mechagon)
[6:48:12] JustDeftPlz: To this day, Every MMO is compared to WOW. And that day hasnt come when the whole world said this is better than wow
[6:48:16] DeanoTV: @emznev TRUEEE
[6:48:21] Jindo_ZG: I wish PVE would go back to the Justice Point system, they did it for PVP
[6:48:32] dracullus: that's why I think account wide borrowed power grind is best option, but people first must burn their fingers, they would crucify blizz if they come with something like this now
[6:48:35] Klavdenz: can you show your gear?
[6:48:38] Drippzsy: Well to be fair probably 95% of the players don‚Äôt have the time to spend grinding for 8 hours a day..
[6:48:39] ninefingerdeath: How do you have the battered hilt quest??
[6:48:43] readyvic: I love grinds but need variety  day to day
[6:48:47] raye_gaming22: taking off work just to grind 15+hrs maw a day was not fun
[6:48:50] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  there are news about the new Immortal season on wowhead
[6:49:00] Herzenliegen: Yes it was
[6:49:09] Kisswani: I disagree with that one tbh .
[6:49:12] ninefingerdeath: How do u have battered hilt q ?
[6:49:13] ghost186_: I like ZM
[6:49:14] dracullus: you must be into collecting to enjoy zm
[6:49:19] Kisswani: I kinda like ZM for multiple alts
[6:49:23] Fugazi811: more sandworn relics
[6:49:32] duffluv22: Does ANY MMO do it right?
[6:49:33] acebrown24: I dont like shadowlands u have to do to much in it to be max
[6:49:53] Thoreya: i liked zm for prob 2 chars
[6:49:54] svu3: I like collecting too. did so many island expeditions to grind the dragon rider armor
[6:49:59] Thoreya: getting 4 piece for many alts sucks
[6:50:16] Mattysaiyan: What's wrong with ZM?
[6:50:24] Thunder4o: @acebrown24 you are wrong here,they made it after 9.1.5 that you got to do next to nothing to be max
[6:50:32] Rottencoarse: POG
[6:50:33] theSalute: sexy
[6:50:34] Xerothrone: Skull-chad cleaver!
[6:50:35] theSalute: whats it look like
[6:50:38] Kinghorn: 3.4 speed coxRee
[6:50:38] theSalute: pog
[6:50:38] ThatW0lF: No damage meter?
[6:50:39] ambiotic: I want to do an alt so bad in shadowlands but then i logon think about all the shit i need to do and nope right back to the monk
[6:50:44] IceMECH: i need that for my hunter KEKW
[6:50:47] bigoldmeatpie: agi? hunter weapon
[6:50:49] theSalute: I remember that model!!!
[6:50:56] scenario17: pre-bis weap for sure
[6:51:00] gremthartv: SMOrc axe right there
[6:51:17] ChrisMFCook: When do you think prepatch will drop for wrath?
[6:51:18] Neyo59: @ambiotic you cant just get everything on all classes because you did it once
[6:51:19] Kisswani: THD's expansion tier list is gonna some fiery comments KEKW
[6:51:19] acebrown24: I play private servers like warmane frostmorne mop mistblade stormforge and use to play apollo3 until last month it's kinda dead I wont pay for retail and I like to not do as much stuf till u mac
[6:51:22] acebrown24: max
[6:51:23] 3663Sharad: towOny towOny
[6:51:34] ohnot___her: IF they tie some sort of power to this new renown system in DF, I  think id be pretty hyped
[6:51:36] Kyrrua: all the epics dropping for all your runs today
[6:51:40] readyvic: Shadowlands killed it for me hoping dragonflight is good atleast i have wrath this time
[6:51:40] Kyrrua: op
[6:51:45] silodin: where is this trivia?
[6:51:45] Zivs: it's just for interaction with the tweet
[6:51:46] ninefingerdeath: How do u have battered hilt questline?
[6:51:47] silodin: i need to know
[6:51:53] Ruzzy_Fhino: my issue with current retails wow has no gear that is iconic anymore. I come in here and the shat shield and sword and my jaw hits the desk. just much better items and iconic ones at that. wow now and raiding seems to be shared stats across multiple items just different design. #Make items matter again
[6:51:57] Timothious: does running with mostly plate weares help you get more plate?
[6:51:59] Kinghorn: if it might possibly get me a key idgaf
[6:52:07] acebrown24: wotlk and cata where best exp think
[6:52:12] ChrisMFCook: @mattymulfa there a vendor that sells is in beta, but can't turn in
[6:52:13] 770Cash: If it gives me beta I‚Äôll take it lol
[6:52:14] BlewGamingGroup: wouldnt be so bad if they gave keys to everyone that guessed correctly in like the first 5 minutes
[6:52:23] ChrisMFCook: @acebrown24 I agree
[6:52:34] ninefingerdeath: How do u have battered hilt questline??
[6:52:47] grimmy17: Just log into alpha now then YEP
[6:52:48] pzumja: @silodin its on the warcraft twitter
[6:52:51] Hakazo: @Towelliee Back from the timeout, As I was saying good sir, wow is probably gonna have to go no system before people learn that we need systems, AP made casual feel fun everyday, due to that shadowlands is now my least enjoyed expansion honestly
[6:52:53] ThatW0lF: Palawin
[6:53:23] Kriven: is twitter down for anyone else?
[6:53:35] Zivs: That's what Dragonflight is looking like so let's see it @Hakazo
[6:53:35] Kisswani: @Kriven nope , fine for me
[6:53:39] ThatW0lF: OwO
[6:53:42] Warblade23: @Kriven nop
[6:53:45] Kriven: @Kisswani k
[6:53:55] silodin: i don't have twitter :(
[6:53:56] Hakazo: @Zivs Yeah exactly, hope the patches will have systems so we dont have to wait 2 years again
[6:54:27] Lasidor: Isnt there usually a vendor for that stuff on beta?
[6:54:39] Zivs: @Hakazo agree to some extent, im down to see what its like
[6:54:43] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Heyhowsitgoingtonight subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! towHAMUP
[6:54:45] gremthartv: what about rep gear? get the right tabard? ‚ùî
[6:54:51] duffluv22: Why did WoW get rid of relics and librams??
[6:55:06] Thoreya: this song <3
[6:55:08] Hakazo: @Zivs Yeah I guess, just happy we leaving shadowlands, lets see how dragonflight feels
[6:55:15] yeti82: to little anima you get from WQ
[6:55:20] nvnto: tier sets are
[6:55:27] Kyrrua: @duffluv22 cuz its not a rpg anymore
[6:55:43] Zivs: Dragonflights zones and dungeons will probably make the expansion way better than Shadowlands for me alone, i disliked this place from the start
[6:55:57] sshadeh: @Zivs ye

[6:56:06] HaloS23: rep grinds, attunements ??
[6:56:12] Sielu11628: I can't wait to see the Dragon Isles Map and zone maps. Gonna be huge
[6:56:25] Hakazo: @Towelliee My man, if we now assume 10.0 not to have alot of systems etc, do you think blizzard would dare to put some systems or some grinds in patches? my speculation is that wow is gonna invest harder in patches, especially after how 9.1 and 9.2 was
[6:56:30] dracullus: SL don't have grinds, it's just too complicated, you must keep track for gear, talents, legendary, covenant, soulbind, conduits
[6:56:33] rival_xo: nostalgic wod music of last zone or smthing <3
[6:56:45] Hakazo: @dracullus agreed
[6:56:45] mmo_kenna_: Dragonflight needs to bring the passion back, Shadowlands has felt formulaic and hollow
[6:56:53] TacDuc: As a Blood DK, I just have to pick pretty much every baseline ability from the skill tree
[6:56:56] ChrisMFCook: One thing i really dislike about shadowlands, don't let people get better gear from things other than end game content. Vault can give you better stuff than heroic raiding. That's BS to me
[6:57:07] duffluv22: We're gonna need some burrowed power to remove that big ass sword...lol
[6:57:16] dwolf010: seems like an other day with no news regarding alpha
[6:58:07] Yofappafappa: tempering expectations is always the healthiest choice. we all want different things they always go in different ways, and they'll continue to make money on the dedicated and the returners
[6:58:10] Winnie_theBro: How long would it take to complete Zereth Mortis content starting fresh?
[6:58:10] ThatW0lF: How you doing towllie
[6:58:14] ninefingerdeath: How do u have battered hilt questline?
[6:58:19] Kyrrua: cannot wait to buy a mamoth that will block you at most door and force to unmount Kappa
[6:58:27] Timothious: has anyone been making bag upgrades on beta
[6:58:48] CJayMillz: How come you doing rep on beta? Looking for bugs?
[6:59:12] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[6:59:23] ambiotic: Make AOTC harder like it was in WOD
[6:59:27] brewgamingtv: max said it at one point that finding 19 other people u get along with is the hardest part to mythic raiding
[6:59:27] DogShep: Mythic raiding also requires more of a commitment than heroic since it's not flex. Harder for people in certain situations for sure.
[6:59:37] c0mmander_starscream: 4 Da HORDE
[6:59:46] GypsyBoxAU: its the horde guilds in OCE that struggle to recruit for mythic raiding
[6:59:51] mmo_kenna_: your always going to get guilds in the middle of heroic and mythic
[6:59:56] brewgamingtv: yup

[7:00:22] Bannawhip: real talk
[7:00:24] ChrisMFCook: and give things that feel worth it
[7:00:27] paperzino: do you think they should remove addons from raids/dungeons? @Towelliee
[7:00:29] ArroArroArro: Heroic raiding should be the best gear, than just have mythic for the challange and mount/transmog
[7:00:37] browniebatter: Seems like a lot of other games are going in the direction of the actual hardest difficulty being cosmetic/flex only. And not BIS gear
[7:00:41] Hakazo: @Towelliee However it have felt before, I am so fking excited for dragonflight, I am expecting cozy leveling in dragonflight just like in wod, leveing in wod was great <3
[7:00:45] dwolf010: give HC mythic level of gear. and Mythic only cosmetic?
[7:00:50] tyluxtv: People who make those comments about Mythic Raiding are the people who think they are good enough to do Mythic raiding but don't want to put the time, effort, or commitment into the game.
[7:00:50] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Reacting to "Why old MMO's feel better" youtu.be/Mjy0mGyT1Dc
[7:00:53] Narovoid: I feel that with Mythic+. Nobody had to do any tier of raiding other than mythic
[7:00:54] mavericks312: just make lfr normal and have heroic and mythic be for guilds
[7:00:58] Kisswani: I certainly hope creation catalyst will carry on as a system into DF

[7:01:22] Bannawhip: rarely any loot drops from raid anyway ://///

[7:01:49] gremthartv: Isnt the real issue that you have LFR, Normal, Heroic and Mythic? Was more clear back when it was Normal and Heroic imo
[7:01:57] ArroArroArro: remove gear from mythic raiding, make it a challange with ttransmog/achievements and shit
[7:01:59] Kisswani: @Zivs yeah you're right , I do remember hearing that from Ion I think
[7:02:00] dwolf010: give HC mythic level loot. and mythic only cosmetics
[7:02:45] TacDuc: I'm not doing mythic if I don't have a chance for drops that I won't get
[7:02:46] tyluxtv: @dwolf010 that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard
[7:02:48] Draco_wolfstein: do you thinks nails the same feeling as playing wotlk or is it better
[7:02:50] Kisswani: D: what ?
[7:02:59] ChrisMFCook: I feel like N-H-M is fine, but each level has to feel like its worth doing. That's the point
[7:03:00] Metket: @dwolf010 KEKW
[7:03:07] Hakazo: This fking song man POgU
[7:03:09] silodin: Transmog
[7:03:18] brewgamingtv: yup
[7:03:20] browniebatter: @tyluxtv most other games are doing that now. And they all work out well tbh. Wows the only one holding on to that old mindset
[7:03:28] zysmos: power is fun too
[7:03:28] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: gtfo ff14 andys
[7:03:29] ArroArroArro: And they will get the best gear and best power and best everything from heroic. instead of mythic. Whats wrong with that.
[7:03:30] silodin: 100%
[7:03:33] silodin: i will
[7:03:36] Kisswani: it certainly is the best feeling in the game still : Getting an upgrade
[7:03:39] tyluxtv: @browniebatter then play those terrible games
[7:03:41] Mercii_Dx: Power shouldn‚Äôt transfer to pvp and only be for pve
[7:03:42] 770Cash: as soon as I saw some geared dude in org i knew i wanted to raid
[7:03:48] JimKappa420: mythic without loot is bad idea no one will ever do it
[7:04:00] ShowDUH: !alpha
[7:04:00] Moobot: @Showduh PREDICTION JULY 14th | WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-internal-alpha-now-on-blizzard-catalogue-327322 | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[7:04:05] browniebatter: @tyluxtv I don‚Äôt, I prefer wow. But that doesn‚Äôt stop the concept from being good lol. A good game takes things that are successful in other games.
[7:04:12] Timothious: seems like alot of work for Blizz to do for a few players
[7:04:17] TacDuc: I want the loot, not doing it if I can't get it...
[7:04:17] mmo_kenna_: I'd argue visual progression is better than ilvl
[7:04:18] Herzenliegen: I don't get why people are so bent on comparing ff 14 to wow
[7:04:18] mavericks312: ask liquid and echo if they would raid for tmogs and mounts lol
[7:04:26] ChrisMFCook: Having uber geared toons is ana amazing feeling. That's why most of us play..
[7:04:30] Hakazo: @Towelliee I think the entire wow community needs to man the fk up respectfully, get into grinds, push higher levels - this comming from a casual player. We're just way too needy for less grinds and free stuff, there is no satifaction with no grindy stuff imo
[7:04:31] silodin: The alliance grand marshal gear is what got me into wow
[7:04:36] ArroArroArro: I¬¥m a firm believer that majority of the playerbase would be glad to get rid of gear in mythic. Let the top players battle it out. You see all sorts of crazy things people do to challange themselfs anyway
[7:04:38] silodin: i rolled an undead
[7:04:42] tyluxtv: @browniebatter but it's not a good concept. Why do the hardest content in the game for cosmetics? I'm sorry but that's just silly
[7:04:44] gremthartv: Merge LFR and Normal, keep Heroic and Mythic?
[7:04:47] paravak: They raid for prestige
[7:04:58] jarilrpg: they raid for world firsts, not for gear or anything else
[7:04:58] Moobot: Diablo IV showcase - https://youtu.be/94wQxtv_sAc | Confirmations - https://twitter.com/RodFergusson/status/1536068892086243328 | https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1536053922875310080 - TLDR Paid Game, Store for Cosmetics and Expansions.
[7:05:04] rival_xo: limit quit the race last time, bet the investors are happy
[7:05:05] jarilrpg: gear is a means to an end
[7:05:08] dwolf010: then why was the mage tower such succes if no one does anything for cosmetics
[7:05:11] NayutaMiyumi: As an FF14 raider, who came from WoW, I miss WoW Raiding fam
[7:05:13] pealladk: hey @Towelliee thanks for the alpha key! enjoy the $500
[7:05:14] browniebatter: @tyluxtv because that gear is required for every other piece of content in the game. Which isn‚Äôt a good model in 2022
[7:05:15] Hupu_a: Should wow take the token system from FF for raids. example every boss you kill give you tokens which you can turn in for gear from the bosses you have killed? would that work?
[7:05:17] ArroArroArro: Speedrunners just game for prestige, you think that wont be a thing for mythic raiding if htey remove the gear?
[7:05:18] raye_gaming22: all of us wr <50 guild would raid for presige
[7:05:20] silodin: LFR is fine but normal has to go
[7:05:23] raye_gaming22: no cope
[7:05:30] bypized: Alpha out?
[7:05:34] TacDuc: It's solo content, that's why
[7:05:37] tyluxtv: @browniebatter You 100% do not need mythic raiding level gear to do the rest of the content in the game.
[7:05:39] Syllvn: people don't run the hardest content in FFXIV every week. it's a once time thing for the achievements. that doesn't work in a weekly format like WoW
[7:05:42] KraigLooney: i just finished a tour of towers today for the mount. it's still good content.
[7:05:44] Kisswani: @windi_ I would be down with that as a sort of bad luck protection
[7:05:52] browniebatter: @tyluxtv otherwise you end up where you are now having mythic ilvl loot come from other sources anyway. If you want to keep all of that, sure
[7:06:02] Theliahh: @KraigLooney bro how is your name glowing
[7:06:06] YaBoiClams: low key artifact weapons were AWESOME
[7:06:06] dracullus: I hope we will have solo challenge for some badass dragon skin
[7:06:10] Kisswani: @simplySylvan never considered that . great point
[7:06:17] mmo_kenna_: visuals > ilvl
[7:06:21] KraigLooney: @Theliahh bttv legacy perk
[7:06:27] NieIas: time to furiously reload bnet?
[7:06:28] Kisswani: FeelsBadMan
[7:06:39] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: ff14 andy detected
[7:06:40] ArroArroArro: @Towelliee  I¬¥ll jsut say, I think your wrong, but I might also be wrong, hard to say without testing it or seeing it happen. I want heroic raiding gear be the highest ilvl
[7:06:46] Theliahh: @KraigLooney dang that's cool
[7:06:49] Velashen: It‚Äôs a tired conversation but there are a lot of us that didn‚Äôt like wow trying to become an esport over just an mmo.
[7:06:55] Crowargus: its also ecluding alot of the raider base n catering to top guilds not all guilds can clear mythic in heroic only gear they rely on upgrades to progress
[7:06:55] Timothious: where is Dragon Flight happening in the world?
[7:07:06] sshadeh: catJAM
[7:07:07] KillzwitchTV: Dragon Isle
[7:07:14] Fugazi811: @Timothious Dragon Isles
[7:07:19] NayutaMiyumi: Like after doing all of 14s Tiers, and Most of WoWs Tiers, the biggest Issues WoW ran into was when they initially catered to casuals with LFR
[7:07:20] Hakazo: @Timothious pretty sure top right on azeroth map
[7:07:27] paperzino: do you think they should remove addons from raids/dungeons? @Towelliee
[7:07:31] NayutaMiyumi: WoW Doesnt need much if anything from 14
[7:07:41] DeanoTV: @NayuMiyumi most of WoW players are casuals
[7:07:42] Timothious: ahh so they discovered some new islands
[7:07:44] tricky_86: I think for most people having grinds that are purely for cosmetic will be dependent on how dope the cosmetics look. The cooler the weapons, armor, and Dragons are from the new non power grind, the more engaged people will feel. Much like the Mage Tower.
[7:07:47] Hakazo: @NayuMiyumi amen
[7:07:48] dwolf010: @NayuMiyumi lol casuals are the least of the problem
[7:07:53] InfamousMaverick: InfamousMaverick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! 
[7:08:06] smashwow: comp weakauras are not good
[7:08:17] MrGharr: they could just disable addon communication and everything is solved
[7:08:20] Frank4LuLz: no more bprrowed power, new expansion, new power
[7:08:23] unholyfleshx: what are frost chips?
[7:08:24] duffluv22: Oooo piece of candy..lol
[7:08:25] Hyelander_: I think they need to ban people who have unhealthy obsession with removing ALL the addons
[7:08:27] rival_xo: the people i know still raiding onr retail wow have no jobs irl

[7:09:29] DragonofWolves: As someone who  plays both WoW and FF14, most stuff in FF14 won't work with WoW anyway. FF14 bases stuff around it's story. WoW does not.
[7:09:30] Timothious: add ons have been added to the game if they are popular
[7:09:31] Kisswani: but it's not just DBM and stuff like that , I would never have even tried healing without Vuhdoo or Healbot for example . why disable those ?
[7:09:36] Drizz_36: they aren't going to remove addons. that crusade is silly
[7:09:44] Crowargus: trust there are alot of people that dont use addons you just have to pug a mythic + or heroic raid to find that out
[7:09:54] ArroArroArro: @Towelliee But would you like blizzard to try all sorts of diffrent things for one patch?  Try maxing out loot at heroic, doesnt work revert. Try allowing masterlooter again for a tier see how it works. Or whats your chance on big test like that?
[7:09:58] mmo_kenna_: you can heal without healbot now, they added click casting
[7:10:16] NayutaMiyumi: You can raid without addons, but most will ask *why go the extra mile*
[7:10:21] Hyelander_: Its the loudest, most obnoxious and entitled crusade.
[7:10:27] ArroArroArro: even more addons being implemented in DF
[7:10:33] ArroArroArro: with the UI overhall
[7:10:41] paperzino: I just hate how much of a disadvantage you are if you don't have DBM or weakauras
[7:10:42] Zivs: @ArroArroArro for what it's worth, they stated that they do want to have something that isn't masterloot but something similar for DF
[7:11:03] thilgan12: Did wrath have dungeon maps and quest markers on the world map? I don‚Äôt remember. May have been cata

[7:12:27] ArroArroArro: yea, wish they¬¥d be a bit more out there trying things, ditch what doesnt work and improve what works. They just keep ditching everything :/
[7:12:34] Kisswani: I use WAs for visual clarity , but I only raid heroic usually
[7:12:50] Kisswani: for rotation purposes mainly
[7:12:53] Velashen: I‚Äôm super excited for UI improvements. It‚Äôs long overdue.
[7:13:01] NayutaMiyumi: I raided without WA and DBM in Dzar Alore and it wasnt that bad, you just have to rely on your memory more
[7:13:05] bypized: @Towelliee have you heard about the LOTRO revamp by Daybreak to get the wave of the new Amazon show?

[7:13:14] ursinealli: My husband tanks our heroic raids without WAs or DBM.
[7:13:17] BlewGamingGroup: unfortunately the devs code the game around people using addons

[7:18:01] Hakazo: @elixirfield1 first you complain about lore in wow, now you complain about pixels on wow. Mate just admit you being a FFXIV andy dawg. FFXIV raids looks like a complete clusterfuck brother
[7:18:04] Frostfury: Bring 10 man back and people will start raiding more of course
[7:18:24] c0mmander_starscream: Just make a reddit post to find your 20 people to mythic raid
[7:18:32] IVJamieIV: Absolutely 10man mythic please
[7:18:34] metavahn231: nah i just want WoW to actually evolve lol, there should be a WoW 2 with much better graphics by now
[7:18:38] paperzino: @duffluv22 because it's dumb and increases degen behavior

[7:18:46] Metket: alliance players raided lich king hc last they can learn new mechanics
[7:18:54] Velashen: I think there just needs to be stronger world content. As a casual I would rather that all day long over some mythic raid or dungeon.
[7:18:59] Thunder4o: bring 40 man raids back,more people will raid Kappa
[7:19:08] rfmoore1965: Wrath was and will always be the best.
[7:19:13] almostdps: 25m always
[7:19:19] supersmak: You've got 9 friends?  Damn man...your popular af
[7:19:19] JimKappa420: lich king 10hc great
[7:19:20] Kneckt: 9 friends? I have 0
[7:19:22] Kneckt: Kappa
[7:19:23] rival_xo: 25
[7:19:30] TwoCenk: 10M SoO was harder than 25M
[7:19:36] Frostfury: 10 man Mythic would be amazing tho, less hassle with struggling numbers
[7:19:41] Hakazo: @elixirfield1 wow 2 also now.. man you've brought up everything utube andies are saying about wow. my man the game is far from its best state but these points wouldn't make the game better homie, instead we should give legit feedback. I aint hating, just makes no sense what people are complaining about nowdays
[7:19:51] mmo_kenna_: 9 friends? all mine stopped playing wow along time ago
[7:20:03] rfmoore1965: The problem will always be gear score.
[7:20:06] MrGrimms: @Towelliee can we talk about the real hype for wrath, the kill videos that were nicely produced after 4 guilds got the kills??? Paragon was amazing
[7:20:06] YaBoiClams: @TwoCenk you on crack?
[7:20:08] paperzino: mythic raiding is a waste of time now.
[7:20:10] duffluv22: @paperzino I think thats opinionated honestly. It really showed be an distinguished achievement to show you actually took the time to do it
[7:20:11] mmrghost7: mythic should never be flex
[7:20:11] IVJamieIV: 10m has always been harder content wise due to the smaller margin for error and tighter dps checks.
[7:20:12] rfmoore1965: your GS is too low
[7:20:13] acebrown24: yea in wotlk 10, is easier then 25
[7:20:17] mmrghost7: it messes with boss hp
[7:20:23] Timothious: Ican see having 10 man step up to 20 man but why 25?
[7:20:33] LordFFlink: maybe flex mythic after hall of fame
[7:20:57] bypized: @Towelliee Have you heard about the LOTRO revamp by Daybreak to get the wave of the new Amazon show?
[7:21:06] RedXIII: it's sad we have to have this convo years later. i 100% think there should be content to push you to be a better gamer.
[7:21:13] mmo_kenna_: Some guilds never seen BT and Sunwell in TBC but that was fine you respected the people that did
[7:21:20] Flyer_753: I think maybe you don't call 10 Man Mythic. Give it another name, might get rid of the confusion/stigma
[7:21:27] IVJamieIV: 10m mythic or 20m mythic

[7:21:44] rfmoore1965: Some of us are old and limited to get better, we need help to get there
[7:21:47] eNeruFPS: @bypized they keep delaying the revamp no idea whats going on
[7:21:49] MrDToTheIzzle: What ever happened to new world? was it a bust?
[7:21:51] rurounijosh: it has nothing to do with skill.. just time put in.. which makes the game unfun
[7:22:07] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: then fix it then
[7:22:07] paperzino: @rurounijosh yes exactly
[7:22:12] Baldarsar: just watched thor 4, cool funny movie üôÇ
[7:22:16] supersmak: Get rid of Alliance.  Problem solved
[7:22:24] smashwow: no there's just a roster number in general. getting 20 people together is a bitch even on horde side
[7:22:30] InfamousMaverick: I like mythic raiding and having a spot for the top players, but it feels like the majority of design for the game is for Mythic which is 1%-3% of the population
[7:22:30] WnbSami: Just make crossfaction guilds, would fix all the alliance relevant problems
[7:22:33] trivotix: Make everyone horde
[7:22:35] nihilistic_bat: @Baldarsar seeing it on saturday, cant wait
[7:22:37] rfmoore1965: Grinding dailies and grinding rep are the biggest kills for WOW ever
[7:22:42] silodin: faction change was on sale though :)
[7:22:43] Mattysaiyan: Get rid of Horde, problem solved
[7:22:47] Kisswani: HIRE THAT MAN
[7:22:48] dracullus: @Towelliee imo instead of nerfs, mythic raid should get buff for our dps/health that goes up every week and if you kill boss without it, it gives hall of fame title for your character
[7:22:49] c0mmander_starscream: RIP Alliance
[7:22:50] magakigr: why not get rid of horde ? :P
[7:22:55] RedXIII: KEKW
[7:22:56] gremthartv: isnt this history repeating itself? didnt Cataclysm start giving same ivl gear to both 10-man and 25-man? while it was different in wrath?
[7:23:00] rurounijosh: their game is gonna die unless they make 10man mythic top tier
[7:23:04] trivotix: Horde is wow
[7:23:04] silodin: i just wanna prog mythic with bobby. on god
[7:23:05] DragonofWolves: FF14 is getting a new dungeon difficulty that feels deadlier then Mythic+ So yeah every MMO has their own version of what a high tier dfficulty is.
[7:23:05] NieIas: towel still on? alpha tomorrow confirmed
[7:23:06] XshadowturkeyX: there deff is enough ally to mythic raid with jsut alot of ally are becoming more casual players,
[7:23:11] nihilistic_bat: if you get rid of horde, no one is playing wow anymore Kappa
