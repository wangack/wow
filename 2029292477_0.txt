[0:40:04] FrostmagicED: okay, so if you're an experienced healer you'll REALLY like MW/Rdruid in keys this season
[0:40:17] FrostmagicED: Stay away from hpally
[0:40:39] ZeL77: MW easiest healer to play rn

[0:42:47] FrostmagicED: but it does like 140k hps even in baby keys without trying
[0:42:53] ImJimpa: I never really played holy, i used to play alot of disc so i tought maby try holy for the first time
[0:43:05] FrostmagicED: if you're trying to have fun; play whatever you want
[0:43:10] FrostmagicED: if you're trying to deeeeeep push
[0:43:13] FrostmagicED: play disc
[0:43:29] ImJimpa: alright! i will just try some specs out!

[0:45:35] FrostmagicED: my druid is geared, and I whip it in keys for my weekly
[0:45:38] FrostmagicED: and have a good time
[0:46:01] FrostmagicED: but if I play it too much my RL is gonna make me play it in raid b/c I'm currently 2nd disc/holy and rdruid does more healing than that spec
[0:46:58] FrostmagicED: ik that's a WILD take to have about treants
[0:47:28] FrostmagicED: I'm just giga autistic and like having full control over where my heals are going and I can't control the trees the way I want. :(
[0:47:35] xanderly: hehe … just leveling druid so no idea yet how treants feel in the end

[1:34:33] FrostmagicED: @ImJimpa if you can get into 17's without tier, then wait till you get a piece from a 17; otherwise, gear you get from 9's
[1:34:51] treavorthenusance: just like moblie games they make all of the money off like 10% of guests

[1:51:54] justbeachi: 9 seconds off timing a 26 rise yesterday, i have legitimate depression
[1:51:56] kelly_mac06: @Shreddermus i spanked my son ONE time and not even very hard when he was like 4, he laughed at me and said "spank me harder mommy". i laughed so hard i had to go outside
[1:52:04] dadgamer_o7: most kids dont learn how to be tidy until theyre teens or early adulthood because only then does being a slob have social consequences
[1:52:14] P4weZ: Sadge
[1:53:06] jenok_15: !guide
[1:53:06] StreamElements: JB no longer keeps his Wowhead guide up to date and has no plans to make another at this time.
[1:53:55] Guffels: thats my wife to a t. i just look over it so much that it doesnt effect me. its not even intentional anymore
[1:54:16] dithrica: I hate mess and love my area being clean but the adhd executive dysfunction is real and I struggle massively keeping up with it on a day to day basis lol
[1:54:20] treavorthenusance: well if you have kids you auto get the worse roomate LOL
[1:54:44] Morphzero: LOL all my room mates and my last and current wife have a lower standard of cleanliness than I do

[1:55:26] Sokchoy: elitist much
[1:55:49] treavorthenusance: jb only plays with the flyest players and the hottest dudes
[1:55:51] Guffels: why is eveything Sokchoy puts in chat just streamer bait lol
[1:55:54] FrostmagicED: I haven't had time to do a 27/28 yet
[1:55:58] justbeachi: i mean it's just logical to not waste your time with people who can't time keys
[1:56:02] Morningstartt: well i haven't touched serious keys yet jdotbOMEGAYELL
[1:56:04] apertured_wizard: people dont understand the leap from 26 to 27 much less 26 to 28
[1:56:11] healapotamus: maybe it’s a reroll
[1:56:12] FrostmagicED: I'm just now starting to cross the threshold of 23 to 25 tho
[1:56:13] hipposlam: hes literally doing some of the highest keys out there. by definition he is elite lol
[1:56:46] Sokchoy: im salaried not waged
[1:56:47] dadgamer_o7: are you running shadowfiend on tindral or mindbender
[1:57:09] treavorthenusance: woah woah slacking off at work is the most ethical thing you can do
[1:57:15] Guffels: SF because lorrgs says to but dont tell soc
[1:58:00] Sokchoy: hes running SF because hes a very high IQ individual
[1:58:23] dadgamer_o7: no free thinkers here
[1:58:25] jon061210: I’m not at your level of keys, I have been timing 20’s. they are kind of easy. I was wondering how much the difficulty ramps up in 21’s and 22’s.
[1:59:00] misstrace: I cannot stand anything on my glasses
[1:59:07] apertured_wizard: fingerprints right on the lenses ECH
[1:59:16] Guffels: if I can see through them its clean enough
[1:59:30] apertured_wizard: i would touch my dad's glasses like that and i feel so bad now lmao
[1:59:35] Darksillence: after a while, the brain just ignores the smudges on your glasses
[1:59:37] NeiGHtoE: idk how some people aren't driven crazy if there's anything on their glasses
[1:59:44] apertured_wizard: my chat messages today really sell me as a guilty child
[1:59:45] JackBurton176: @jdotb the oily eyelashes.  The new eyeglasses still work good if they have smuges in them.

[2:07:26] apertured_wizard: jk thats half an ironfur
[2:07:41] caradea_: thank god that nothing there is interesting
[2:07:42] FuruF: An ironfur at like level 60 would give that much
[2:07:47] TheTeamWebb: viewer timewalking tastelessStare
[2:07:55] Sokchoy: "WoD was best expansion" enjoyers when all their trinkets are sea star
[2:08:04] caradea_: imagine something op and you'd be annoyed not having it for the rest of the season
[2:08:30] xJazus: is that a WA that shows what classes are in the groups in the group finder?

[2:10:11] Zughoul: Oh wrong vault my bad
[2:10:12] delibear_tv: oh okay
[2:11:11] apertured_wizard: is it time to hit up season of DISCOVERY jb? /s
[2:11:45] ReallyHandsome: ReallyHandsome subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[2:12:20] apertured_wizard: unironically druid is so much fun in vanilla
[2:12:48] Marshlolz: we had no healers first weeks and everybody made healers xD
[2:12:52] eyeoin: what does oslo queue mean? like LFD?
[2:13:01] Guffels: knowing blizzard the queue would stop at 20
[2:13:34] apertured_wizard: would like to just play the game right?
[2:13:37] Finkl_: agreed, there's no downside to having it as an option
[2:13:55] casualshame: preach!!!
[2:14:19] JmantheThief: @Finkl_ people who enjoy doing 3s in pvp would argue that there is definitely a downside to solo shuffle (3s LFG is dead afaik)
[2:14:21] apertured_wizard: theres a score system and everything- the framework for bracketed keys is there
[2:14:30] Marshlolz: and the system will find the people untill next expansion xD
[2:15:02] P4weZ: but solo and premade rating is same and not like in pvp?
[2:15:04] Finkl_: @JmantheThief well if a system killed 3s then 3s probably suck
[2:15:10] JackBurton176: have more babies and you can do them 12 years.
[2:15:16] m3tabee_: what would you say is your favorite healer?
[2:15:35] Kevmoeman: Would be nice to have that especially for alts I just want to get into groups and do stuff
[2:15:44] TB85: why dont you have a team?
[2:16:03] apertured_wizard: im pretty sure the vast majority of players dont have a consistent group
[2:16:06] Su1a: Then people will leave if they are not satisfied with the group and it will be the same as looking for it yourself (even considering the same 30 minute ban).
[2:16:07] TheTeamWebb: to cute
[2:16:12] treavorthenusance: probably that yogurt that got left out
[2:16:27] apertured_wizard: @Su1a hey then theyre out of the queue for 30min
[2:16:37] Guffels: those were great streams
[2:16:38] Kevmoeman: Pvp benefitted from solo shuffle in season 1 then participation tanked because of queue times
[2:16:39] JackBurton176: @treavorthenusance vanlopezFoxyDance
[2:16:40] eyeoin: on a solo queue they should have CR that drops on depletes too.
[2:16:55] Guffels: @Su1a ever seen a solo shuffel queue? at this level its gunna be way over 30 minutes
[2:17:09] menzlo: Even NA rn is like a pool of guys playing together rather than a set team
[2:17:16] justbeachi: but more people play m+ than pvp
[2:17:16] menzlo: Except for jpc team
[2:17:54] Shkafche: imagine depleting/leaving Q reduces your RIO too
[2:18:07] Shkafche: key*
[2:18:10] Su1a: @Guffels yeah true
[2:18:21] WingedChipmunk: lmao no one would do keys anymore, it would not be worth the the hastle
[2:18:29] TheTeamWebb: there should be a leaderboard and achivements/titles given out for top 1% like pvp
[2:18:41] frazlord: I'd play the fuck outta that.
[2:18:43] Gemini_Tank: @WingedChipmunk I would do them 10 times more
[2:18:51] Kevmoeman: Downside of solo shuffle was it was the best way to get rating and rewards so group finder fell off then shuffle fell off
[2:18:56] Gemini_Tank: cba playing the q more then the actual q
[2:19:07] P4weZ: @WingedChipmunk well thats why solo que should notbe only option
[2:19:11] Shkafche: also MMR in solo is still horible for healers
[2:19:11] frazlord: @WingedChipmunk organized groups would be better for sure but for a lot of people, this would be more beneficial.
[2:19:15] Gemini_Tank: that way I can atleast do other things while q
[2:19:30] Guffels: idk, getting into pug keys at 20 is really fine and doesnt need a system. unless you think a queue would make more people do high keys
[2:19:31] Gemini_Tank: more then the actual key*
[2:20:31] Spritesgud: Got a new MDI team yet?
[2:20:59] Guffels: idk people are so picky when building groups and signing up not even wanting someone 2 key levels below current key. Just sounds like a tilt fest waiting to happen
[2:21:06] Kevmoeman: Pve would have limited downside, if you did a 30m ban it's probably more worth it to try the key and fail than just sit around for 30m
[2:21:27] apertured_wizard: they even put a soft lfg in SoD like they know the grouping system is frustrating
[2:22:16] JmantheThief: isn't that just listing your own key and taking people that apply?
[2:22:23] menzlo: It could potentially be the same with long queues? I'm with you tho it's worth a try
[2:22:36] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:22:48] Kevmoeman: Your keys not always the one you need or want to do
[2:23:06] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:23:07] Chillinar: and then after looking for a key for like 20-30min the grp disbands after the first pull or at the last boss. very frustrating  at the moment
[2:23:16] Guffels: as if it wouldnt take 2 hours to get queued into 1 specific key
[2:23:36] StreamElements: TwitchLit Use your Amazon Prime account for a FREE sub to JB, unlocking  exclusive channel emotes! Terms and info here:  https://twitch.amazon.com/prime TwitchLit
[2:23:38] menzlo: Dxm also saying he's having lack of team issues saying there's no tanks on NA
[2:24:18] Guffels: a solo queue system would have to have some amount of doing keys that get you no io. sometimes you have to be the highest io on the team
[2:24:54] Kevmoeman: You could just set it to only put you in keys that would improve score
[2:25:21] JackBurton176: @jdotb The law of the lid. When you play on the best team you learn more too. You can only get as good as the best skilled person on your team.
[2:25:42] Raethus_WoW: I think the pool will be extremely limited
[2:26:01] Marshlolz: good luck with that, above 25 nobody wants to play with random people
[2:26:17] fusion2102: what do you think about depeting a timer beeing the failure metric...what else can there be for a solo shuffle system
[2:26:21] rembrandt89: solo q is cool until you get that dickhead that signs up an leaves just troll it already happens in pvp solo
[2:26:28] jess0x9: even if it takes slightly longer its still better imo. when i queue for shuffle i queue then do something else until it pops. when i do keys i have to actively be in game searching
[2:26:30] Finkl_: i would 100% play with random people
[2:26:39] Finkl_: as i'm also running in circles in valdrakken
[2:26:41] Brotrain: what if i just make fresh toon and boost a 25 - it'd put toon in +26 tho, might make some unfun situations
[2:26:52] Marshlolz: i mean, there would be so few players queueing it will take forever
[2:27:08] Walkynator: are there no conections to players that could get you into teams? you played against all the best teams in the past, right?
[2:27:22] menzlo: Zero to hero learning french
[2:27:26] WoozlesTV: @jdotb sorry if I missed it, but didn't you usually play with the same people? Why are you not playing with them anymore?
[2:27:29] Kevmoeman: You'd maybe have it only count the dungeons you solo qd
[2:27:35] Brotrain: that makes more sense
[2:27:38] Kevmoeman: But that kind of sucks
[2:27:50] JmantheThief: imagine having to start at +2, kms
[2:27:51] Finkl_: if you have 4 friends to boost you then you don't need solo queue haha
[2:28:17] menzlo: If they kept lfg alongside you could do a 24 lfg to unlock 25 solo
[2:28:22] Silencbank: maybe make it a 5 level cut off?  if youve done a 15 you can que for 10s, done a 20, you can que for 15s
[2:28:32] WoozlesTV: fastest way is to play your own key
[2:28:35] Siraeyou: That's solo queue . Sometimes you get carried and sometimes you do the carrying
[2:28:49] Kevmoeman: It could just match you with people of similar overall score, harder to boost the whole score

[2:30:36] apertured_wizard: m+ always gets these improvements an expansion too late LOL
[2:31:28] fusion2102: how about we have a MDI style solo shuffle system where its more about speed running that high key pushing and then a THE GREAT PUSH style life key system with far less punishments for depeting keys or no timer at all
[2:31:37] JackBurton176: @jdotb  I just started playing again. I noticed that you can play M+ with alliance. MOBS with frontal atacks paint blue in front of them when they do that. What other cool things has blizzard done to improve M dungeons?
[2:32:13] menzlo: Would it encourage more leaving?
[2:32:15] FrostmagicED: @JackBurton176 thats nothing to do with blizzard, frontals this season are just blue
[2:32:26] JackBurton176: It would be nice if there were more rewards like the M completion dragons
[2:32:26] FrostmagicED: @menzlo leaving in a queue doesn't MATTER
[2:32:30] Ok_Kingston: you should at least get 3-5 lives on a key before it depletes
[2:33:12] JackBurton176: @FrostmagicED  so frontals in other dungeons like BFA dont have blue on them. that sucks
[2:33:29] menzlo: I wonder if the meta classes would be diff in random solo
[2:33:36] JackBurton176: @FrostmagicED  i saw the blue frontal in waycrest.
[2:34:29] Guffels: to make solo work you first have to fix the meta where nobody depletes keys by finishing the dungeon.
[2:34:56] zebracak35: i'm 3.1K shadow priest and finding keys to push is starting to get real burdensome
[2:35:18] Guffels: but then io would just be if you queue into 4 meta specs and got carried on a shit class

[3:03:28] Nebulizer87: also team comp matters so much for RWF and we just don’t have those classes nor are they performing at a 99% level
[3:03:39] JukeboxHey: Are you not raiding today, just tuned in
[3:04:06] justbeachi: heard the nerfs will allow people to step on two seeds
[3:04:08] justbeachi: which is bonkers
[3:04:14] nicoboot: Was that tweet about the insane team a joke or not?
[3:04:38] Mordrim_EU: I completely sympathize. Raiding has become a prison for me. And I asked to be benched for the rest of the progress. Bizen even got further and left the guild.
[3:04:48] Nebulizer87: we just rot off near the end of P2 every time
[3:05:11] GrimFandango: You did seem a little unhappy on Raszageth too LUL

[3:05:40] JukeboxHey: I loved star augur prog KKona
[3:05:47] JackBurton176: @jdotb what are some tricks to stay alive in the raid in terms of avoidable damage? Can you share?
[3:07:30] fusion2102: what kind of raid or m+/grp dmg is the most fun/interesting for you to heal? .. some crazy ramping dot dmg .. or hard hitting spot dmg .. or smth else?
[3:07:45] JukeboxHey: It is gonna be a good night Pog
[3:08:30] Nebulizer87: KJ was absolute torture

[3:09:13] Feyded: lol man guilds and their breaks
[3:09:30] Nebulizer87: trial of valor was tough as shit at launch
[3:09:45] Nebulizer87: Rashok and Smolderon been my favorite
[3:10:13] JukeboxHey: Oding was dope
[3:10:17] JukeboxHey: Odin*

[3:11:05] menzlo: 3rd phase I mean
[3:11:20] Walkynator: sounds like we need a unicycle emote
[3:11:22] JukeboxHey: I loved Elisandre from The nighthold.
[3:11:25] fusion2102: i never understood what you are supposed to do if you dont kill odin in 2nd rune phase xDDD
[3:12:09] JukeboxHey: What?
[3:12:14] DuCkiii3: how is this echoing tyrstone on resto druid ? just got it last night
[3:12:18] Nebulizer87: Helya was literal hell
[3:14:29] JukeboxHey: Scripe RL on Helya was peak preformance from a RL
[3:14:41] JukeboxHey: In the raid that is
[3:14:53] JmantheThief: is anyone else hearing discord notification sounds?
[3:15:11] suparferret: chat did he say who backed out of the MDI god squad? need to know where to direct my disappointment
[3:15:19] JukeboxHey: He played Surrender to madness and raid lead on Helya
[3:15:27] GrimFandango: @suparferret yeah it was Dorki x4
[3:15:31] BBQ__Bob: do you like tarren mill? Thinking of transfering my characters there
[3:15:40] GrimFandango: Dorki, Dorki, Dorki, Dorki, and Jdotb on Tank

[3:16:21] menzlo: If firedup is involved it's always firedup
[3:17:22] nicoboot: Sadge
[3:17:25] Galois_rg: I'm 0% surprised that firedup backed out lol
[3:17:31] colt149: oof

[3:18:56] JmantheThief: james isn't interested in playing for 2nd place
[3:18:57] JukeboxHey: Have you found anyone else for a team? or is the MDI dream dedge

[3:24:12] SevzyYEP: @jdotb you voted for next season tier set yet?
[3:24:17] leubinator: imagine if +25 keys had a chance to drop myth track gear so u don't have to prayge to the vaultgods every week
[3:24:19] JackBurton176: thanks
[3:24:30] leubinator: an actual reason to push m+
[3:25:01] caradea_: nah they should drop some sick transmog
[3:25:22] leubinator: fuck transmog nobody needs that shit i want my branch on 489 xD
[3:25:26] zebajin: tmog sure gear no its not like u dont meet enuff boosted ppl in 25+ keys
[3:26:01] kelly_mac06: @zebajin a unique mog would fucking lit. id love to see rewards like that
[3:26:13] kelly_mac06: similar to what pvp gets
[3:26:15] meowphietm: @leubinator thats an L bozo moment right there
[3:26:43] Yoshimaster94: basically old challenge mode tmog? that'd be sick
[3:26:53] fremen14: bro still being on tindral must be so frustrating lol
[3:26:56] kelly_mac06: right?
[3:26:59] cbaprod: Sup JB
[3:27:29] gamercatfish32: what healer is easiest to learn m+ and start pushing high keys
[3:27:51] zebajin: prob druid
[3:28:03] zebajin: bets for pugs Monk but way "harder"
[3:28:08] JackBurton176: is this mythic?
[3:28:08] zebajin: best*
[3:28:09] JmantheThief: LOL
[3:28:28] gamercatfish32: ahh alight cool thank you
[3:28:41] zebajin: @CartierKenton if u can handle the button overload i would say MW

[3:29:21] gamercatfish32: how about disc
[3:29:46] zebajin: disc is good but its harder to play in pugs but if u have a team sure
[3:30:20] zebajin: MW just spins to win
[3:30:22] caradea_: i think it's fine also, all healers run into problems with bad teams
[3:30:47] JackBurton176: what is killing everyone?
[3:30:50] GumdropsTSM: what's it gonna take for jb to rage at the guild for not learning
[3:30:55] caradea_: whatever you enjoy more of those three will be best, cause you'll fail a lot of keys anyway
[3:31:11] mogaman_: Everything is deadly
[3:31:34] JackBurton176: what is soakable and what is one shot?
[3:31:46] JackBurton176: yes ill look at the book
[3:32:00] sukoWoW: Tindral is like if they took every single one-shot machanic in M+ and put it on one boss
[3:33:35] Sokchoy: guys we really shouldnt be wiping in p1
[3:34:31] holymolyy9: 483 leech better then a 489 piece ? on druid
[3:36:31] swedishhousemafiaa: are u built to raid?
[3:36:59] Fredle: This fight will break so many guilds. It's been a while since we had one of those.
[3:37:02] FuruF: Are we having fun yet?
[3:37:34] nicoboot: @Fredle Painsmith was a killer, but not of top 200 guilds

[3:51:16] duplexity_dave: kinda crazy there hasn't been more raid nerfs
[3:51:23] JmantheThief: it won't because it will be after big nerfs
[3:52:00] TheHDS: @duplexity_dave yeah lol, my guild got here last week and it doesn't feel killable for a mid CE guild
[3:57:49] Arvakr: are u having fun
[3:58:36] kelly_mac06: ppl are gonna be at Skyline pull counts
[3:58:40] kelly_mac06: if they dont nerf boss
[3:58:59] leubinator: i am still so impressed by skyline that they managed to send 1k pulls
[3:59:03] JmantheThief: our RL has been getting on us for meme-ing too much during tindral prog but I'm pretty sure it's the only thing that's keeping us sane
[3:59:22] kelly_mac06: @leubinator RIGHT! i would have lost my fucking mind
[3:59:58] leubinator: i wonder how many of them quit after the tier

[4:27:22] trickkzz: like the healer absorption ? A number pops up that im assuming you have to heal off?
[4:27:59] SevzyYEP: So many previous world 20 guilds (last tier) sitting on 8/9 right now, game dying Sadge guild drama everywhere peepoSad
[4:28:52] trickkzz: I think it's the fact that these fights are very technical and a bit overtuned, it causes a lot of frustration
[4:35:23] Sokchoy: i was here
[4:41:40] YdenTV: Man is there really about to be a 10.2.5 with zero class / spec / dungeon / raid tuning?
[4:46:02] FrostmagicED: hey dad question
[4:46:09] FrostmagicED: what embellishments should I play on MW

[5:09:31] davidart2: try to replicate it or is it too difficult
[5:11:55] Kmork1: if i wanted to practice raid healing what do you think the best heroic boss to pug is

[5:20:21] Nebulizer87: replicating is an issue when you don't have the exact same comp
[5:20:27] Nebulizer87: like we have an ele shaman
[5:20:35] Nebulizer87: i think there is only like 4 logs of a ele sham on a kill
[5:21:27] Nebulizer87: or a holy priest instead of disc, so many hurdles to overcome when you aren't running the best possible comp for a fight

[5:54:30] trickkzz: Hey if anyone can answer this: Every guide I've seen states you should split the groups on average of 6 per soak due to the debuff My guild is deciding to soak with everyone inside to get rid of the circles quicker or sometimes 50/50 Thoughts?
[5:54:57] trickkzz: Mythic Igira
[6:06:04] FuruF: bobfleA3 Fun. Fun. Fun bobfleA3
[6:06:49] Nebulizer87: you typically just make range soak on mythic igara
[6:08:10] trickkzz: @Nebulizer87 they are stating that because it's quicker its better to soak all together, but I view that as a big loss in dps
[6:09:40] Nebulizer87: yeah no point you just have range soak and sort out a good stacking for spears and execute the fight
[6:09:52] Nebulizer87: the only other part where ppl wipe is the healing debuff popping on the raid

[6:12:49] Geysi82: got killed by EU ping
[6:16:28] trickkzz: @Nebulizer87 yeah I don't think pulling everyone is a good idea for DPS. The healing orbs yeah, people have to learn to dodge, based on logs, it's a lot
