[5:02:49] Urebaldd: @Wulfgrym I mean better than nothing, but not gonna do much
[5:03:03] TexValhalla: @slickferd no you gotta use one or the other

[5:04:37] slickferd: @GrittyTexan yeah im already all setup with elvui took me like 2 hours to do it all. idk if the shadow in the action buttons is really worth swapping all that over again
[5:04:38] Wulfgrym: @Urebaldd not like 10% was going to put us on par with the top 5 dps classes or somesthing
[5:05:07] Urebaldd: @Wulfgrym Yeah true, sucks

[6:06:55] pereadin: @xluckydawgx are you playing frost dk or frost mage?

[6:07:13] pereadin: I enjoy UH more than Frost
[6:07:36] pereadin: It's definitely worth the switch at the higher level. I've had people whisper me before inviting me to keys making sure I wasn't Frost because of how much of a trap it is.

[6:43:28] bec0o: i did heroic
[6:43:32] bec0o: only
[6:43:52] Nalleys: uh huh
[6:43:53] MrGattz: i cant wait for poe again. i sink about 200 hours in per league and its a glorious 200+ hours Kreygasm
[6:43:56] bec0o: how can i tell what is M+ or not? just asking and they say there is different layers
[6:44:07] maccaruso: Cyberpunk is a buggy shit-show on every format
[6:44:09] kokochris: Cyberpunk as a game as a whole is meh. Regardless of platform
[6:44:10] ZeethianDragon: Cyberpunk is horrid on console
[6:44:24] Masqerader: shit look like san andreas on ps2
[6:44:29] bec0o: i dont get why so mad about simple question tbh
[6:44:41] JukasZor: @bec0o this is a m+ 13 key you can tell by the [13] next to the timer in the right. Toghast has layers, M+ has keystone levels
[6:44:43] verZUNGE: @bec0o the timer in the right side of screen means its a m+
[6:45:03] bec0o: oh okay thanks guys
[6:45:04] MrGattz: @bec0o dont worry about it, its fine. you can tell its a m+ cause the list on the right side of the screen with the timer is your progress in the dungeon
[6:45:13] bec0o: now makes sense
[6:45:23] kokochris: @MrGattz I havent played POE in a while; but im considering playing the new league next week. Looks pretty cool
[6:45:23] bec0o: ty
[6:45:33] Urebaldd: LULW
[6:45:34] Masqerader: LOL
[6:45:36] metavahn231: why am i doing 1k dps more than most people more ilvl than me

[6:47:39] kokochris: @MrGattz thanks. I hear ya. I will still play it tho next week; I like the league's because you can drop in and out as you wish. No biggie and dont feel like you lost anything
[6:47:42] Lloydbanksz: the talent tree in POE is such a turn off and is y i havent played poe
[6:47:51] bec0o: she was
[6:48:07] TweakT: PogChamp
[6:48:17] TheNoMansLands: @Lloydbanksz its a treat
[6:48:32] MrGattz: @Lloydbanksz its really not as complex as people make it out to be. you follow a build online for your first 2000 hours or so and you just follow the path on the build guide. you dont need to understand how every node works
[6:48:35] Kromede: i played poe tolevel 7, to hard to get in
[6:49:55] ZeethianDragon: I think it would be kind of cool if the m+ timer increased by 1minute for every 2 Key levels to compensate for the difficulty increase.

[6:51:32] pownagez: just jump and die :D

[6:51:45] gutzkun: @towelliee why did you switch race ?
[6:52:48] Masqerader: they really need to adjust that gauntlet, sanguine, grievous and necrotic shouldn't appear there

[6:53:49] soge131: jstea , you can no longer cancel chi torpedo into other actions, so roll gives you more control of your movement in bosses, you also get Tiger Lust

[6:57:53] Winduhh: RIOhell
[6:57:56] HeavenlyDarkling: raider io is so fucking toxic
[6:58:05] pilhass10: true
[6:58:22] yazzi152: not 100%
[6:58:23] pereadin: I agree. As toxic as people may think the system is. It's important at some point, especially when pugging mid tier keys
[6:58:24] theDirtyon3: Raider io isnt people are
[6:58:37] TheNoMansLands: @Towelliee wait, you can get multiple items from the vault?
[6:58:43] SlayerLightStorm: People are toxic.
[6:58:44] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @franklton (warning)
[6:58:51] pereadin: Cause when you get to the absolute highest level its typically the same 50 people running together per region. Outside of that the system really helps
[6:58:56] Zebingt0n: all raide io is a system to find people of similar caliber to play with
[6:59:08] bec0o: but if someone is new, how can he prove himself if he dosnt get teh chance to get pugs?
[6:59:10] meeechow: Raiderio is toxic when you play a warlock LMAO
[6:59:12] FarmVillle: you can still be bad and have good io xd
[6:59:13] Decoyszn: Raider IO is toxic WHEN the WoW community requires it even for trivial gear, like a mythic +3
[6:59:16] EMPORIUM0174: It's only toxic for those who cant get into a group
[6:59:16] spujetti: People who hate on io suck at M+
[6:59:21] TweakT: raider io is a gangster filter
[6:59:23] rinnegan_madara: TOWELLIE why nobody play a ret pally anymore
[6:59:24] fistofnature: @Towelliee If you do 1 mythic raid boss and then 2 heroic bosses, will you get heroic or mythic gear from the vault?
[6:59:31] meeechow: Pretty sure the only reason I get invites is because they see 4/10 mythic atm.
[6:59:35] Decoyszn: Raider IO is fine for the 10+'s, but the community is so elitist they want an IO for a Mythic +2
[6:59:37] TweakT: only gangsters get to play
[6:59:43] Tru1485: @fistofnature heroic
[6:59:44] metavahn231: "hE mUsT hAvE boUgHt CaRrY Pepega "
[7:00:03] TheNoMansLands: zuljin is down?
[7:00:03] Aidler: raider.io is good for the top players and it goes contrary to a good community of players
[7:00:06] bec0o: but how new players get the chance
[7:00:07] Seerated: useful maybe, used wrong by most ? Yea, unfortunately
[7:00:10] Tru1485: have to kill 3 mythic bosses for the mythic item
[7:00:10] TheNoMansLands: nvm i got booped
[7:00:24] yazzi152: i agree but when it coms to some players that have the skill but not the time its a little toxic
[7:00:27] Waspire: i cant even get in a reg mythic because of raider io.....bahhhh
[7:00:45] gutzkun: Why are you not a panda anymore
[7:01:04] TweakT: i dont use io and i never done a higher than +2 in SL VapeNation
[7:01:07] thawzin001: i got 1k io but hard time getting inv to a 13
[7:01:08] TheNoMansLands: as 186 ilvl its even hard to get into +2s
[7:01:09] TheBeastofCaerBannog: paid for a carry got a +12 key from it
[7:01:09] bluecanary1893: Elitists will always like the barriers to entry to their elite club. In this case IO measuring
[7:01:10] thawzin001: hard life
[7:01:12] metavahn231: there's alot of good tanks that carry their noob friends
[7:01:36] metavahn231: then that noob has a high key lol
[7:01:39] ZeethianDragon: Carring isn't that simple anymore which is GOOD
[7:01:39] TheBeastofCaerBannog: it's not that easy to get your raider io up either when people wont take you cause your raider io is low
[7:01:58] inj0shwetrust: What if youre a returning player who is good but there is no one who wants to take you
[7:02:04] rinnegan_madara: @towelliee why nobody play a ret pally anymore?
[7:02:08] RealInsanoid: i mean some people don;t want to do all the dungeons
[7:02:10] TweakT: papers pls
[7:02:11] RealInsanoid: that gives a bad io
[7:02:16] metavahn231: you are not worth taking if you cant build your own IO with your own key imo
[7:02:17] Moweryy: yeah trying to get into mythic + is damn near impossible
[7:02:17] inj0shwetrust: That will kill the game
[7:02:17] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years.

[7:02:25] CockneyRat: how do you get the first invites?
[7:02:27] Moweryy: if u have no friends that play that is
[7:02:28] TweakT: noobers can stay noob in the low +2s
[7:02:31] TheBeastofCaerBannog: i typically run mythics with 3 friends and the pug always gets the loot
[7:02:33] Vivelli: @inj0shwetrust hasnt since its come out
[7:02:35] Darthyrevan: Darthyrevan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[7:02:36] Waspire: which is wrong as hell because then others cant get to enjoy the game...
[7:02:37] soge131: Would you rather invite a person who has those credentials or someone who does not? That's the point
[7:02:38] Aidler: the whole M+ system is exclusionary. that‘s the main problem. raider io worsens it for most
[7:02:38] yazzi152: whats the diffrence of taking one your friends thats is super skilled but no io
[7:02:43] Craban: I'm playing casually tho, and for me to get into a M+ higher than +5, even with 190 Ilvl.. It's just way too hard :(
[7:02:45] Freakzene: Impossible to be a new player trying to do anything
[7:02:49] Waspire: elitist crap
[7:02:52] Metket: i stucked at +13s on every 14s and 15's mostly tanks has no idea about the routes, prides popping out in the middle of the hard packs, dps with 1k rio doing 3 interrupts whole dungeon etc etc
[7:02:57] swordart_19: @Waspire stop blaming others for lack of own effort.
[7:03:09] Cosmolus: of course . People refuse to see videos explaining what they have to do or even reading the adventures guide.
[7:03:18] soundzGOOD: my priest ist 216 and i play the game solo (i play pvp only tho)
[7:03:26] Winkz: it doesnt help
[7:03:31] swordart_19: Still on BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage bye chat
[7:03:32] GoobleGamingTV: Actually why I am not playing anymore. Pugging is close to impossible if you want to progress even a little and its not fun

[7:03:54] DudeThatsDope: @towelliee Do you think FROST will replace fire as main spec with the buff??
[7:04:07] Kazualll: bobby would never phrase it like that
[7:04:28] SanikTheDank: WoD was just terrible no matter if you were hardcore or casual imo
[7:04:35] Thoreya: This ravens game is giving a heart attack man
[7:04:36] KingSlayerYotam: we need to see how much people still play after the covenant campaign is over in 2 weeks
[7:04:44] skdmaster: What legendary you using on your BrM?
[7:04:45] Thoreya: Why is it a struggle in the playoffs every year for the ravens
[7:04:47] TweakT: nah, server queues are no more, so subs went down
[7:04:48] MourvinMad: me and 5 of my irl friends reeturned for this xpac
[7:04:57] Cosmolus: just pump the number of items that drop from raids and m+. that's all
[7:05:01] MourvinMad: we last played WotLK
[7:05:02] DudeThatsDope: @mourvinmad same
[7:05:03] Winkz: once you open a pandora's box (ie: more gear dropping) it is very difficult to close it
[7:05:03] jaalexba: My man blowing clouds
[7:05:09] Waspire: i have a job and work 6 days a week. sunday is my only free playday. dont call my effort lower than others. because of lack of time.
[7:05:20] boppianna: i just started playing for the first itme since cata and i personally do like the new expansion though i cant compare it to some of the ones prior to SL
[7:05:31] loragheta: WoW still has more subs than any other game so
[7:05:39] ZeethianDragon: true
[7:05:41] Aidler: I canceled my WoW sub. I‘m not paying 12 bucks a month so that only top players can have fun
[7:05:48] Dumpsterr: pretty much almost everybody in my guild is pretty apathetic about the dungeons and a good chunk don't like the raid
[7:05:52] Cosmolus: towDrunk
[7:05:57] christmas_wg: why did you switch you main to Tauren
[7:05:57] ZeethianDragon: who said only top players can have fun? KEKW
[7:06:00] Cru3: Is tomorrow the Rust stream @towelliee Kappa
[7:06:03] soge131: I love Shadowlands, I'd rather not have to PvP or buy 226 BoEs in order to gear my char fast enough but everything else is rly cool
[7:06:06] christmas_wg: or alt
[7:06:14] rinnegan_madara: @towelliee why nobody play a ret pally anymore?
[7:06:15] TweakT: there's always pvp, u dont have to be a top player to kill some fools Kappa
[7:06:28] Dumpsterr: a lot of the blind praise is strange I basically have to pvp to have fun and be rewarded
[7:06:32] TweakT: pvp is just stun 123
[7:06:43] Aidler: I don‘t do pvp
[7:06:46] Karbonn: Let's be honest though, every expansion there's a huge spike in subs at first.
[7:06:51] loragheta: We're at wrath level of gearing actually
[7:06:51] Hitokiri83: i dont remeber bc being this bad
[7:07:02] TheNoMansLands: its better like this
[7:07:05] stratiss: Feels fine to me, but I also do all forms of content.
[7:07:08] loragheta: we're the item level we were in wrath
[7:07:17] wilZifer: @waspire I feel you. we need a voice for new/working players. what to do...and options for serious powers with limited time
[7:07:23] ZeethianDragon: the drop to 60 from 120 isn't what I expected. 100 would've been fine
[7:07:27] soge131: @Towelliee what do you think about master loot? Should it return with the amount of loot we have now?
[7:07:28] iDystinct: Its alt frendly in a way, but this gearing is making me not play more then 1 toon.
[7:07:34] wilZifer: players not powers
[7:07:37] Tigerklaue: callings are pointless
[7:07:41] TheNoMansLands: am i thew only one who likes it
[7:07:55] ZeethianDragon: M+ is really disappointing to do right now. lack of weapons dropping is terrible
[7:07:56] wilZifer: I like it though
[7:07:57] coffeeatm: I dont think they ever will return master loot ever again
[7:07:58] rinnegan_madara: @towelliee why nobody play a ret pally anymore?
[7:08:02] chopsaki: what happen .. thought SL is best expansion ever?? that was quick
[7:08:09] findobin: atleast tbc had the pve conquest from dungeons, or whatever it was called
[7:08:25] bec0o: yea i dont like pvp
[7:08:29] Tigerklaue: a pvp player can choose a 226 gear of his choice every week thats just not fair
[7:08:31] pereadin: On top of that PvP gear isn't itemized properly for all classes
[7:08:38] ZeethianDragon: PvP is so quick that gear grinding is short compared to PpvE
[7:08:41] woodchuck91: i know one thing - I haven't played pvp in WoW this much as of now since - well forever. But thats just me doe
[7:08:57] Vivelli: yep
[7:09:15] metavahn231: i think the story will save the expansion, probably the best it has been for awhill
[7:09:17] Dumpsterr: literally the only full 220+ players I've seen were on sinful gladiator shadow dragon mount LUL
[7:09:19] Maytan26: they should add a currency system for mythic +
[7:09:26] Tigerklaue: im at 7 mythic boss kills and no gear drop so far
[7:09:26] Seerated: It killed first tier rading in our guild for the first time since Vanilla, now everyones pvp'ing
[7:09:30] wilZifer: it sounds like the casual players plan to good gear
[7:09:32] Shredmuffn: blizzard using logic now way LUL
[7:09:33] SquarcioLudico: but u need rating to upgrade anyway
[7:09:34] Decoyszn: I mean lets be real here, the problem is there is no PVE vs PVP stat. Like WoTLK Resil.
[7:09:39] soundzGOOD: i basically get 2 x 226 items from pvp every week :)
[7:09:42] clariusgaming: One Cannot Simply Just PvP
[7:09:48] ZeethianDragon: 233 PvP weapon everyone bragging about. can only be found in PvPp. Big HMM blizzard
[7:09:55] swordwindgaming: BGs invadates Heroics, storyline armor + garrison + arena welfare invalidates M+0-5 grinding and normal raiding
[7:09:58] Desetra: Desetra subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Sup Towelliee, how's your day been?
[7:09:59] Gerr_x: almost all tank specs have BIS pieces from pvp, which is the really really ridiculous part
[7:10:03] Dumpsterr: valor badges PogChamp
[7:10:05] Tigerklaue: why i cant upgrade my normal/hero raid gear if i do mythic?
[7:10:05] Vivelli: great for pvpers but its not balanced for pve in terms of rewards
[7:10:12] rafikinalecker: definitely
[7:10:13] TweakT: no pvp stat = pve'ers slaughter pvp'ers
[7:10:21] cheersfordoobies: 210 from M+15s but you only need 1600 rating for 213 LOLOL

[7:10:24] cheersfordoobies: pretty funny
[7:10:30] Chimp458: valor tokens
[7:10:32] Vivelli: it does
[7:10:36] stratiss: Mythic + is infinitely farmable though...
[7:10:41] stratiss: and pvp is not
[7:10:50] deathdealer75: people would never finish doing M+ each week
[7:10:55] Winkz: lol its almost like blizzard had a system in the past that worked...and then they killed it for no reason
[7:10:59] treeni13: So put a cap on it @stratiss
[7:11:00] Shrenko: finally pvp getting some love
[7:11:02] Winkz: Kappa
[7:11:04] Dumpsterr: my guildie paid 850k for 1800 rating
[7:11:07] soge131: @stratiss They just need to make those "valor points" weekly limited
[7:11:11] Tigerklaue: pvp gear should be pvp gear and not pve gear
[7:11:22] TheGiant99: The grouping system is broekn as well. Puggin is virtually impossible.
[7:11:25] ZeethianDragon: PvE dungeons feels nerfed loot wise. it's so bad
[7:11:41] billybaroo1: inb4 they put resil on gear again
[7:11:47] Gerr_x: try 2 mil
[7:11:55] Cal_Kat: just need vendor with same gear for both pvp/pve, just diff styles/stats and to obtain each gain either a type mark in pvp or type of mark in pve. i dont see why thats so hard for them to understand
[7:12:01] swordwindgaming: If money is no object, just buy your Arena rank for dat 226
[7:12:05] Majedwk: Hi towelliee biggest love from Saudi Arabia
[7:12:39] TweakT: make retail like clashick wow and then it wont die VapeNation
[7:12:42] swordwindgaming: what I really fear is if they institute arena rank degradation to counter the rank buying
[7:12:44] Arocian: yep
[7:12:50] ZeethianDragon: those casual players will leave
[7:12:58] Dcarter: on the other hand i dont mind raid logging lol
[7:12:59] Arocian: if casuals can't progress in pve or pvp they will leave
[7:13:08] TweakT: make 1-60 leveling great agane
[7:13:10] TheGiant99: The player base is kinda a issue also with all the elitism going on with the raider io addson
[7:13:13] coffeeatm: @Eveloire Like you mean happend to Wildstar, cater to the hardcore playerbase
[7:13:23] stratiss: WoD sucked cause there was no content, not because gear was harder to obtain.
[7:13:24] ZeethianDragon: Shadowland could make or break WoW badly.
[7:13:27] ArcaneMaki: True
[7:13:30] Vivelli: fun but not rewarding, wears off very quick
[7:13:34] Lupuri: some people don't have a choice but to be casual because of work or school... it's not all our fault. I'd love to raid but I have no time because of college
[7:13:38] toobaked1987: Its fun? The Maw and Torghast super suck, man.
[7:13:42] liden86: but wildstar was deliberately designed to be an oldschool MMO vibe
[7:13:48] liden86: they overestimated the market
[7:13:50] aberkofwarcraft: try hitting level 60 and cant get past renown 19
[7:13:53] tweezus: @Towelliee I am a casual and already stopped logging in daily. barely got to 193 on my prot and pretty bored.
[7:13:54] ZeethianDragon: no one can just simply do 10 mythics a week.
[7:13:54] 91Niki: The vault is rewarding. m+ isn't OMEGALUL
[7:13:57] TweakT: I want lfg tool to spam m+ keys and I want them to get rid of the m+ timer. This would make the game not die
[7:14:02] Metket: @Towelliee do you think boosting m+ gear will end up more boosters for mythic+ scene for gold?
[7:14:02] KonradGM: i mean true but at the same time with great vault you are guara nteed nice ilevel items each week
[7:14:05] Winkz: mythic plus is nearly useless in its current state lol
[7:14:05] TheGiant99: They need to make crafting gear matter.
[7:14:08] swordwindgaming: WoD gear was actually ok for gearing, but the content drought destroyed the fanbase and Ashran was worse than Wintergrasp for many servers
[7:14:09] wilZifer: nope
[7:14:09] Gerr_x: the weekly box from m+ will let casuals get a 210+ normally
[7:14:10] ZeethianDragon: BARELY
[7:14:11] TweakT: I guarantee I would do m+'s if there was no timer
[7:14:11] Desetra: 5% max
[7:14:15] wilZifer: maybe 1
[7:14:16] PhoenixKng: i barely get 1
[7:14:17] Craban: Im a casual palyer, never done 10 so far
[7:14:18] FarmVillle: pugs through 8-10 keys are like 40% timed rate
[7:14:22] KonradGM: i don't i just do pvp LUL
[7:14:25] TheGiant99: What is the point to have professions
[7:14:25] wilZifer: I focus on raids
[7:14:25] soge131: A +15 key giving 210 is stupid monkaS
[7:14:27] Vantro: it's not, I'm only doing my 10 for the chest and I can't really get much of an upgrade if any
[7:14:29] 91Niki: @Towelliee I get 1 done. Sometimes the 4 for next cache.
[7:14:33] ScytaleTv: Psh I don't have time to do 3
[7:14:36] ZeethianDragon: M+ in legion was quick asf

[7:14:55] Arocian: 200 203, try 180
[7:14:56] TweakT: in Legion I didn't have raider io and it wasn't as widespread and toxic & I randomly could pug a +16 key, now I'm sool
[7:14:59] ArcaneMaki: Exactly
[7:15:03] Gerr_x: they wont though, even casuals will get over 210 items from the weekly box though no?
[7:15:13] gimmlay: if your not playing end game why would you care about gear
[7:15:16] PetMyDK: they could solve their problem entirely by just adding an extra piece of loot to m+ at every level/completion speed
[7:15:16] Kauko13: Valor points
[7:15:20] ZeethianDragon: agreed
[7:15:22] billybaroo1: but, i can just watch the lore on ur stream Kappa
[7:15:26] ZeethianDragon: Ion has nothing to do with it
[7:15:27] swordwindgaming: baddies will be trapped at 184 and stuck with BG gear for months
[7:15:30] TweakT: Ion isn't all knowing.
[7:15:34] TweakT: I am all knowing VapeNation
[7:15:42] TheGiant99: the world quewst loot saucks also. Te callings are kinda useless
[7:15:43] wilZifer: I'm just hitting 200...but not too sad it works for where I am but my path to higher levels is pvp
[7:15:47] Rothgard: whether or not it's up to him, Ion has to do the interviews and explain it
[7:15:48] Dumpsterr: casuals with full 197 covenant armor have to spend like 1200 gold on transmog too don't they?
[7:15:49] KonradGM: how much do you think classic influenced looting in shadowlands? lul
[7:15:55] Seerated: It's 'em damn suits deciding, never played a day in their life
[7:15:55] Dumpsterr: cuz it's based on vendor price
[7:16:11] thelittlefoxxy: thelittlefoxxy subscribed with Prime. 
[7:16:13] TweakT: he's an elitist & thinks like an elitist
[7:16:18] TweakT: how can he cater to casuals
[7:16:19] swordwindgaming: He wanted people to suffer in Torghast, though
[7:16:22] ZeethianDragon: Ion knows that the game isn't s great currently
[7:16:26] Baldarsar: @Towelliee just give us Coruption back ;)
[7:16:31] Dcarter: lol what @TweakT
[7:16:39] Aidler: @towelliee you had too much personal contact with Ion and see him too positiv.
[7:16:39] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[7:16:39] Tigerklaue: every pvp player i know is already 215+ itemlvl without doing any pve
[7:16:45] KingSlayerYotam: no way causal players would farm anima/souls for covenant buildings
[7:16:46] KonradGM: i love raiding, drinking beer, and watching towel man
[7:16:49] anjameN: man it should be elitist, why do u get the best gear if ur casual, u dont desreve it
[7:16:51] TheNoMansLands: shame people want to be spoon fed but hey, for casuals its the only way to keep them
[7:16:52] Wonkington1: hey @Towelliee hows it going today buddy
[7:17:14] metlertoledo: game is shit atm for gearing an yes for casual you are in trouble. i love u said ion isnt dumb ii totally disagree.
[7:17:22] Dumpsterr: corruption with the vendor could have been 100% fine if they tuned it lower and we had like 50 corruption resist instead of 125, so you wouldn't need 130,000 echoes to catch up on an alt

[7:17:26] Vivelli: i just want SOMETHING i aint getting SHIT
[7:17:27] toobaked1987: @Towelliee if you're this agitated as a WoW crack addict, the rest of the community is feeling it as well. I am, I do not currently enjoy Shadowlands
[7:17:34] Ragn_Rohk: ragnrohk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[7:17:35] ZeethianDragon: it's just solid gear.
[7:17:37] metlertoledo: i have 5 60s atm an im casual an are stuck at 199 i level
[7:17:40] findobin: I can't believe some people are saying that this is an alt friendly expansion LUL
[7:17:48] TweakT: mythic raiders should be rewarded with top gear first, then in 4-7 weeks the casuals climb slowly to mythic ilvl gear
[7:17:48] Lloydbanksz: TRUE!
[7:17:49] Ganlorth: i have been stuck at 190+ since release, it's bullshit
[7:17:51] feelingthis2020: a casual can run some mythic 4 pugs
[7:17:52] TweakT: that would solve many problems
[7:17:56] stratiss: But you dont need the gear at that point lol

[7:18:01] Metket: git gud LUL
[7:18:05] metlertoledo: i only pvp
[7:18:06] danksly: theres only so long people will log on play a few hours get fuk all before they say fuk this
[7:18:06] pereadin: M+ was originally designed to give casual players an alternative to getting raid gear. We don't have that anymore.
[7:18:07] Kromede: idk if its still his char https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/malganis/Gurgthock
[7:18:10] Klippan23: For me WoW isn't and never will be my main game game, there's always other stuff to play for me. So if i get hardstuck at 200ilvl it's not a problem for me to unsub and come back later. Leaving casuals is mainly a problem for Blizzard, we'll see if they fix it.
[7:18:15] ZeethianDragon: Shadowlands is very UN-alt friendly due to the gear aspect of PvE
[7:18:17] DudeThatsDope: That’s the point of the game.. to get better. You can’t just run MYTHIC 0s and expect stuff @towelliee
[7:18:18] clariusgaming: just get gud 4Head
[7:18:21] KonradGM: @Towelliee do you know of any Polish beer you'd want to try or reccomend?
[7:18:24] TweakT: ded game, back to Wildstar Sadge wait nope
[7:18:26] toobaked1987: PREACH!
[7:18:26] Vivelli: you turn into wildstar
[7:18:27] nilachip: true words my man
[7:18:30] billybaroo1: thats actually not bad, hello free wow Kappa
[7:18:32] grosikx: Wildstar be a :pro Raiders game
[7:18:32] PetMyDK: @pereadin yeah, except raiders can't get gear anymore either
[7:18:37] Rothgard: can't have high rated players without low rated ones. Every winner comes with a loser
[7:18:37] bec0o: facts
[7:18:38] hoyhoy007: wise words
[7:18:45] x_Davincii: imagine walking into your corner store and getting stared down by a mythic raider, some scary shit
[7:18:46] toobaked1987: PREACH MORE!
[7:18:48] trivwik: We been waiting for a tank since you ended your dungeon
[7:18:50] pereadin: @GiraffePackTV yeah which makes it even more of an issue
[7:18:50] cheersfordoobies: PEOPLE love being "good" at video games like it means anything
[7:18:50] nilachip: Towetruth
[7:18:51] smiteyzzz: YEA YOU BASTARD!
[7:18:53] bec0o: straight facts
[7:18:57] Lothawia: Raider io does not help the game at all either its bad for the game
[7:19:02] TweakT: I want Torghast to reward 220 gear YEP
[7:19:05] Aikaniu: Aikaniu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 81 months, currently on a 81 month streak! towHAMUP
[7:19:09] TweakT: then I would stfu
[7:19:12] Dcarter: raider io is fine, people use the tool wrong
[7:19:12] Lloydbanksz: TOWELLIE 4 president@@
[7:19:16] ZeethianDragon: Torghast should've fucking reward gear
[7:19:19] Dcarter: cant blame the tool bc people are dumb makes zero sense
[7:19:21] ZeethianDragon: it gave you NOTHING
[7:19:21] wilZifer: hopefully in 8 months though at least put in a new raid somewhere
[7:19:27] Dumpsterr: didn't torghast on beta give a weekly 216 or something
[7:19:28] metavahn231: IO is fine the dungeon system is bad
[7:19:29] swordwindgaming: real talk, people pugging Arenas need casuals to rank up to combatant
[7:19:30] danimoto10: so you think that we are going tword casuals leaving?
[7:19:32] keepcalmchris: What's up everybody! towHAMUP
[7:19:34] metlertoledo: i care for the casual thats who i am. but bliizzrd only caress bout the 1percenters no one else
[7:19:34] swordwindgaming: it is in our best interest to keep casuals
[7:19:37] Ragn_Rohk: What's the addon you use for the little circle cursor for your mouse?
[7:19:37] Kromede: Ion has still a 184 weapon KEKW
[7:19:42] stratiss: We're discussing something completely hypothetical. You and I have no idea if the playerbase has responded negatively to the changes.
[7:19:43] Xailen: Gated story and gated/terrible gearing methods have been killing my will to play this game. Leveling and daily stuff is the only thing I do, and its getting boring fast.
[7:19:43] metavahn231: you should be able to do 5s and still have a chance at good loot
[7:19:46] wilZifer: yeah probably
[7:19:51] WazzisGaming: Blizzard should hire players like you to make the game better.:)
[7:19:52] TweakT: I want the path of least resistance to gear, a casual doesn't wanna talk to ppl
[7:19:58] feelingthis2020: I bought Shadowlands & 1 month of sub. had fun healing as disc priest but yeah, not interested in grinding pug M+ for gear, & Torghast was tough
[7:20:02] ZeethianDragon: Torghast is straight rough on casuals
[7:20:02] NovaSun84: Damn I'm a casual LULW
[7:20:10] pereadin: I've considered quitting just cause I don't want to have to pvp just to get good gear
[7:20:11] Riteonthedot: am casual, can't solo past floor 5 torghast
[7:20:14] nilachip: i main a frost mage and I quit for a momth now
[7:20:16] TweakT: I barely scraped through layer 1 in Twisting Corridors, never agane
[7:20:19] TweakT: waste of time
[7:20:21] karisa_vibrant: I liked preach's idea of bringing back badge gear.
[7:20:21] keepcalmchris: HeyGuys
[7:20:23] cheersfordoobies: had my RL buddy spam 20 +5s trying to push IO but quit because he couldnt get past 200ilvl @Towelliee
[7:20:23] Dcarter: cant go that far @TweakT bc your lowering the value of gear going to that extreme
[7:20:24] duhworks: heroic raiders are leaving
[7:20:29] duhworks: too*
[7:20:30] PotbellyGoat: towHAMUP playoff weekend
[7:20:32] Kromede: ketchup
[7:20:33] DudeThatsDope: If you don’t work at it it SHOULD take longer.. otherwise what is the point
[7:20:33] DiabeticPonyShoe: do you think we should get more than 1 piece of gear for 10 bosses of the raid?
[7:20:33] Vivelli: and nothing drops
[7:20:35] soge131: What's the table add on?
[7:20:36] metavahn231: lets be honest WoW is a casino and they took out the slot machines
[7:20:39] Tigerklaue: you can upgrade pvp gear to 200 soon
[7:20:41] Ralykx: <---- super casual ready to quit myself if it wasn't for watching streams and such like this one
[7:20:42] theoriginalzinng: honestly it would be easy too
[7:20:43] UltiCarnagee: I think there should be a Justice Point, Badge system alternate gearing vendor.. and the Calling Boxes should award a small amount of Badges.. to help the gearing issue.
[7:20:45] pereadin: Like so what if a person who is crap at the game gets full 226 gear however they get it
[7:20:45] TheGiant99: Yea Twisting corridors is a huge waste of time.
[7:20:46] ZeethianDragon: a catch up mechanic for LEVELING only KEKW
[7:20:46] swordwindgaming: heroic raiding is kind of a scam with arena gear system as it is
[7:20:48] FarmVillle: vault is suppose to be catch up but you aint catching shit with 1 drop a week
[7:20:49] pereadin: They're still a crap player
[7:20:49] bec0o: i started two weeks and i see this issue already
[7:20:51] theoriginalzinng: make renown gear level higher with anima
[7:20:53] yazzi152: its not about being bad at the game tho its alot of players that have jobs and familys that get in the way of game time also that still like the game
[7:20:56] ZeethianDragon: Exactly
[7:20:56] bec0o: and i play whole day
[7:20:56] Jaqhuir: what addon are you using for missions @Towelliee
[7:20:57] Vivelli: KEKW
[7:20:57] stratiss: My dude, there is nothing to catch up on right now.
[7:21:02] Ralykx: great take
[7:21:04] Ragn_Rohk: catch up = wow tokens and PvP boosting
[7:21:04] Lothawia: @Dcarter I must be running into the people that dont use io right then lol i get declined for so many keys at 830 score
[7:21:06] mrabs0lute: first time I agree with you Towelloee lol
[7:21:07] Ralykx: no slot machines
[7:21:08] peywon123: Im a casual dad with a fulltime job. Im 214 ilvl and 1900 arena and i complete all of torghast with no problem
[7:21:11] TweakT: I simply want top players to be awarded top gear first, in time when mythic raids are on farm mode by top players the casuals slowly climb to their ilvl
[7:21:13] Giggityshway: Giggityshway subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Preach Towelliee, I’ve been a hardcore server first raider from Vanilla to Cata. Had to step back with career and family, lucky if I get 2-3 hours a week these days.
[7:21:13] TheGaoSora: LUL what a terrible take
[7:21:13] Ralykx: just craps
[7:21:15] beh0pper: what addon is that
[7:21:17] wilZifer: just go back to the end of week two where everybody was getting 190 drops from world bosses
[7:21:25] Dcarter: i mean @Lothawia you are and at the same time 830 is low
[7:21:26] treeni13: Did someone say casino
[7:21:29] TheNoMansLands: @peywon123 theres actually no wau
[7:21:30] stratiss: If you're stuck at 200ilevel, then thats the content you're doing until you start pushing harder content.
[7:21:31] PetMyDK: @peywon123 sounds like you mean "io'
[7:21:32] Orcmondo: @Towelliee what addon is that for mission
[7:21:33] Riteonthedot: just got twisting corridors quest. not wanting to spend hours finishing that bs
[7:21:34] Dcarter: i mean i get declined all day
[7:21:37] Klippan23: Sadge
[7:21:37] PetMyDK: i'm a casual dad and hardcore wow player
[7:21:38] Dcarter: i just accept its how it is
[7:21:46] swordwindgaming: @Towelliee YO THATS ME BEGGING FOR M+10
[7:21:51] treeni13: @dcarter I’d accept you :)
[7:21:53] nilachip: or pay for boosts

[7:21:56] metavahn231: wow tokens are the chips or wahtever
[7:21:58] TheBeastofCaerBannog: i'm 206 ilvl 757 io and i still can't get in a +5 unless my group is leading it
[7:21:59] Hidden_Hybrid: casual players are casual players bro money replaces time
[7:21:59] duhworks: @Dcarter thats my life as a ret plsyer
[7:22:02] Winkz: 100% true
[7:22:03] TheGaoSora: Are we crying there's no titanforge? LUL
[7:22:03] stratiss: im 214 1200 io and get declined all day it is what it is
[7:22:04] billybaroo1: they dont run lowbys anymore. you pretty much pay for that now
[7:22:06] pavepawns: what are we talking about?
[7:22:06] Wonkington1: i feel like im being pointed out here lol
[7:22:06] Chimp458: toragst was so easy in beta and was fun and you didn't get anything but they talked cosmetics and fun crap nothing progression .. now its rough and you still dont get anything
[7:22:08] pioneer_of_dance: or play tank kekw
[7:22:09] toobaked1987: nope. raider i.o doesnt allow you to get into a group
[7:22:11] killswiitch: Blizzard loves that shit
[7:22:13] Dcarter: @treeni13 thats bc you already know lol
[7:22:16] TweakT: tokens saved wow
[7:22:16] bookooti: Yup the only catch up mechanic is a credit card KEKW
[7:22:18] bc_23_: what is this he's looking at
[7:22:22] SavageCheez: AH prices are super inflated also
[7:22:22] Kromede: wait, i have almost 2 mill gold, you say i can buy gear ... damn
[7:22:25] MrKhanes: Im using covenant armor for my 4 lvl 60 xD and using anima to upgrade that
[7:22:27] TweakT: casuals can't farm gear so they farm gold & tokens
[7:22:29] szeeman62: @towelliee how’s 188 ilvl as a casual player ?
[7:22:31] Xailen: I await the patch or update that will bring class balance and game changes. Also hoping for a boost to anima gains lol
[7:22:36] UNSUNG_HER0: whats the name of the command table mission addon? @Towelliee also...the great vault addon
[7:22:37] Arocian: even if you pay for boost the loot drops are so poor you have a high chance of walking away with nothing
[7:22:43] KonradGM: i spend almost 1k pln
[7:22:45] Tigerklaue: just buy boes for 1mil each LUL
[7:22:46] FuWeii: anima is a boring ass time wall ......never have enough ...all my covenant upgrades are still at lvl 1
[7:22:48] Ardailec: @Kromede He means Raiding BoEs. They're far more consistent
[7:22:48] killswiitch: Good lord
[7:22:50] misterwinoe: misterwinoe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Who@p
[7:22:52] paulwow777: LUL
[7:22:54] TheGaoSora: it is what it is
[7:22:59] Winkz: same exact shit is happening in my mythic raid team
[7:23:04] GoobleGamingTV: The importance of itemlevel is crucial right now! A 10 itemlevel or even just 5 is potential thousands of DPS in difference. @Towelliee
[7:23:09] Tigerklaue: i dont get why they add boes every raid just remove boes
[7:23:10] ZeethianDragon: 25 player raid. 2 PIECES of loot. wtf is this RNG. 18 bosses.
[7:23:11] Ragn_Rohk: !commands
[7:23:12] toobaked1987: Dont forget 144 floor of torghast for a mount :D
[7:23:14] Melgor101: manHAA
[7:23:16] byrdeen45: they need to bring back tokens
[7:23:16] TheGiant99: They need to increase the amount of aniuma you can get from WQ's
[7:23:20] sotsil_: @Towelliee i entered mythic first boss 195 ilvl
[7:23:22] KingSlayerYotam: boes items is easier to get than mythic ilvl gearing
[7:23:23] Orcmondo: @Towelliee what addon is that for mission
[7:23:26] Aboknes: buy tokens or pvp
[7:23:26] TweakT: I got a 197 ring randomly from an emissary quest though I think there's casual mechanics under the hood, would be nice if it climbed to 230 ilvl tho
[7:23:29] ZeethianDragon: that's why token prices are so low
[7:23:30] Kromede: EZ
[7:23:36] Aboknes: like 1400 ratings gets you 207 ilevel xD
[7:23:37] SavageCheez: tokens won't keep them floating though
[7:23:38] Hidden_Hybrid: the trade off man time is money so if you value your time higher than others do then spend that money
[7:23:38] Urebaldd: I had to cave and buy a boe 2h, I literally never saw a single one in m+ or raids
[7:23:40] Snackkbar: we killed first two bosses with blue heroic dungeon gear on half the raid
[7:23:40] killswiitch: Pay too win
[7:23:41] Ayleas: Wow is officially p2w now? :O rip
[7:23:43] metavahn231: people going into raids to farm boe's not kill the boss LUL
[7:23:45] PP_W_22Cm: 28 bosses 2 loot doesn't sound normal maybe report it?
[7:23:45] Tigerklaue: i pay for arena boosts and boes LUL
[7:23:55] Jaqhuir: pve vendor like the conquest vendor.. would also be a good way.. i guess
[7:24:00] PhoenixKng: no i think you guys just think you have to, but its all on how we each play the game differently
[7:24:10] swordwindgaming: @TweakT I was in a BoE Mythic Nathria farming raid where 1 pally got 3 pieces that night, but that's just one beneficiary out of 25
[7:24:16] RealInsanoid: i am doijng heroic and normal each week and mythic + i am stuck at 205
[7:24:18] hoyhoy007: as a cusual player, shadowlands has been very frustrating for me, covenenant choice, what class to play, some are OP others are weak (I rerolled into 4 different classes) lol
[7:24:19] Getitonthelow: @PP_W_22Cm thats normal ive cleared the raid 3 times and gotten 4 pieces of loot
[7:24:19] davided: what addon used for covenant mission ?
[7:24:21] Herzenliegen: Have a good day!
[7:24:21] stratiss: Ngl it's weird seeing you complain about the game. This used to be the channel to tune into when every other streamer was being negative.

[7:24:30] sotsil_: @Towelliee thoughts on 6-8 loots for 30 on heroic and 4 on mythic? make it like easier to reach the 215s but harder to go highter
[7:24:31] KonradGM: @Towelliee i spend close to 600+ PLN on tokens LUL
