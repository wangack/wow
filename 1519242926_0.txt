[1:52:39] mmo_kenna_: I'm part of a small community that plays WoW on controller, dragon riding should feel awesome on Controller

[1:53:37] Kale_Nd: maybe just for traveling through the raid but not for the fights themselves ?
[1:54:10] Motivess: the expansion after dragonflight you'll need a hotas to pilot it 🤣
[1:54:34] mmo_kenna_: @feherlofia123 WoW supports controller nativeley now and add-on ConsolePort creates a UI
[1:54:45] riley_poker: it would be pretty funny if dragon riding just turned out to be regular flying but on a dragon. f those gryphons

[2:33:06] thymos_: they are ugly skins anyways who cares
[2:33:06] Aquadriel: problem is, if blizz made a new reward for prime, the critique would be "they spending resources on this instead of making the game better " pepega
[2:33:17] Kale_Nd: Oh no, i bought every wow expansion and now everyone pays just for the last one ? /s
[2:33:19] Obidal: Prot leveling easier/faster than ret?
[2:33:37] R2RHIN0: There was a post on Reddit the other day complaining that the Exmapson icon had not been updated yet...people will complain about anything
[2:33:52] keterych: The gift subs for Overwatch skin was a cool way to support streamers I think from blizz
[2:34:03] leroyblinkintv: i would understand if it was something like teebus longblade that would mess with the economy of a sought after item but these items were dead, idk the last time i saw anyone rocking them on a mog
[2:34:20] Rudric_Ice: yes 15 days of free game time that is a good reward
[2:34:32] thymos_: to boost the OW category viewer count
[2:34:37] Aquadriel: @Towelliee a dude in mmochamp was saying they should give us a wowtoken everymonth with prime gaming OMEGALUL

[2:42:25] emznev: it is funny watching all these classic streamers act like wotlk is going to be hard kekw
[2:42:34] BoezIRL: where is the grizzly hills music?

[2:42:58] wetleafx: i started in cata, and all i've heard for 10 years is how great wrath is. actually gonna play it and see how it is.
[2:43:12] emznev: LUL LUL
[2:43:20] Antoinas: LUL
[2:43:25] StarbuckTech: that was not blizzard.. that was a scammer.
[2:43:25] net_mi: LUL
[2:43:34] Rudric_Ice: did you talk to jokerd about not getting beta access ? KEKW
[2:43:42] Antoinas: @wetleafx tbh wrath is more enjoyable if you played WC3

[2:43:46] Antoinas: frozen throne wc3
[2:44:00] mooseliquid: Are we going to be able to play blood dps on DK? @towelliee
[2:44:02] StarbuckTech: yup
[2:44:04] mavericks312: idk man like I said the reason wrath was great is cause it wasn't classic
[2:44:07] thymos_: why did you hate it
[2:44:09] emznev: did every1 back in wotlk hate LFD but now all want it in the game?
[2:44:10] Effin_Steffin: still hate it
[2:44:16] Thoreya: im more excited for wrath than i was for BC and classic which i wasnt expecting
[2:44:17] odysseus1: at least the music is amazing
[2:44:19] StarbuckTech: still think BC and Legion were my fav expansions
[2:44:32] OGSceneBoy: Legion was my fav def
[2:44:40] NieIas: LUL
[2:44:43] SladeTyphon: wrath is when i started playing wow so i might actually make a classic character for this one
[2:44:46] wetleafx: @Antoinas that is helpful to know. i'll go play wc3 beforehand. thanks.
[2:44:52] thymos_: good story and good dungeons + questing areas
[2:44:53] Tambandia: do they let yall stream alpha?
[2:44:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood DK as DPS really takes off when you get armor pen gear, it's physical damage mostly
[2:44:58] Kale_Nd: wrath was the first time i played wow, sadly it was on one of those servers. i am happy i get to play it now
[2:45:03] Thoreya: taliesin thinks alpha is coming before s4
[2:45:07] mmo_kenna_: Wrath was my peak but I'm not stuck in the past I like new content
[2:45:09] emznev: @Tambandia yes
[2:45:35] emznev: @Thoreya it is prob well before s4
[2:45:39] Westcoast17x: for reals not sure why they dont invite in massive get shit done faster =D
[2:45:45] mooseliquid: @weirdo_dude I miss blood dps lol
[2:45:49] keterych: COGGERS
[2:46:02] StarbuckTech: time for them to open the beta to everyone lol. Best way to test it
[2:46:09] thymos_: VOGGERS KEKW
[2:46:11] Rudric_Ice: wish they gave BDK dps back in DF
[2:46:13] thymos_: CO
[2:46:19] Thoreya: so july it is definitely

[2:46:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: That old dancing rune weapon isn't super crazy, but it's a decent cooldown
[2:46:29] mavericks312: if alpha didn't come before s4 then DF wouldn't be here till April lol
[2:46:49] rxdderz_: how long do alpha and betas normally last on wow?
[2:47:02] R2RHIN0: Apparently, you can get a title for watching WoW eSports for 2 hours over the next few weekends. The "Fearless Spectator"
[2:47:02] Tharia: the whole thing sounds so rushed
[2:47:05] Buckwink: I think they abandoned shadowlands long ago
[2:47:07] Rudric_Ice: all those 100 people are testing so we don't need to Kappa
[2:47:46] wetleafx: can i play wc3 reforged before wrath? i thought i heard there was something different than the original.
[2:47:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I'm going for that fearless spectator title, I was already watching AWC stuff and it has been good even with too many RMP comps
[2:47:59] mmo_kenna_: People can't comment on whether it's rushed or too soon until we see the game and what state it's in
[2:48:06] Klutar: big chain
[2:48:13] Thoreya: @wEiRdO_dUdE same
[2:48:14] Klutar: that starts the drakuru quests here
[2:48:49] Klutar: its the ice ones
[2:48:53] Klutar: south
[2:49:05] tereit: isn't the ice troll the one Bud saps and you cage it afterwards?
[2:49:10] Klutar: and you need budd
[2:49:34] wetleafx: @Antoinas can i play wc3 reforged before wrath? i thought i heard there was something different than the original.
[2:49:38] thymos_: butt dude gachiHYPER
[2:49:51] kappaday23: Keepo
[2:50:24] Antoinas: @wetleafx tbh you dont need to play it i know it makes it more enjoyable cause it tells the tale of arthas but i think reforge did change some details
[2:50:31] tereit: ice trolls are to the south as well
[2:50:35] Klutar: they are south of you
[2:50:43] Antoinas: idk what since i never played reforge i played the OG
[2:50:48] thymos_: he fooled me POGGERS
[2:51:01] BlueBlurPrime: to far, its further south
[2:51:18] wetleafx: @Antoinas oh okay. i got you. i played wc3, but i was too young to understand anything. i might play it just for the refresher. thanks !
[2:51:19] BlueBlurPrime: need blue trolls
[2:51:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: You have bud sap the one type of mob further south I think
[2:51:31] Streamcrush: the last time I was promised a title for watching WoW esports they never granted it =\
[2:51:42] Streamcrush: apparently happened to a lot of people
[2:52:01] Antoinas: @wetleafx if you do play hope ya have fun with it
[2:52:05] swervity82: season 4 is Aug 4th?
[2:52:06] Sarocus: Pretty sure you are in the wrong camp
[2:52:16] wetleafx: @Antoinas it's warcraft ! i will ! haha thanks
[2:52:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: They are around a little ruins
[2:52:17] Klutar: not in this area at all
[2:52:20] Thoreya: @swervity82 august 2nd in NA
[2:52:38] swervity82: @Thoreya ahh okay
[2:52:42] Klutar: further south
[2:52:45] tereit: west of conquest hold
[2:52:45] Klutar: south of the camp
[2:52:46] Sarocus: Want to head southwest from where you got the quest
[2:52:50] Kale_Nd: in the ice area
[2:53:12] NewWorldReign: After Classic and Burning Crusade, which expansion excited you the most? @Towelliee

[2:55:33] Kisswani: @Thoreya given the Kyrie situation I wouldn't blame him
[2:56:09] Thoreya: @Kisswani but now he wants to go to the Suns LUL LUL LUL
[2:56:45] Klutar: gotta be out of combat
[2:56:49] Klutar: and he saps them then you cage
[2:56:50] wetleafx: damn the wrath soundtrack is good
[2:56:52] mavericks312: idk I have a feeling kd ends up in philly
[2:57:08] Rottencoarse: @Thoreya  suns probably will do a sign and trade with the nets with Ayton
[2:57:16] BlinkHeals: are they allowing to boost to wrath or you have to transfer or start over?

[2:57:29] Blah206: Miami <3
[2:57:30] Tremble_UK: Have you watched Hustle with Adam Sandler
[2:57:33] keterych: Ayton to the pacers HYPERS

[2:58:08] BlinkHeals: @towelliee are they letting you start at wrath or do you have to transfer/startover?
[2:58:16] keterych: If KD goes to Suns prolly
[2:58:16] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  not yet
[2:58:24] BlinkHeals: @nailsx1 in wrath
[2:58:24] gravess_66: yeah but signed javale magee
[2:58:25] Kisswani: oh god
[2:58:27] wisplingz: kd to blazers :D
[2:58:35] mavericks312: sucks mavs lost Brunson but I wouldn't give him 100mil
[2:58:37] R2RHIN0: I thought he wanted to go to the Lakers?
[2:58:43] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  kyrie got opted in for nets so it needs to be an even trade
[2:58:45] Kisswani: Kyrie and Mark Cuban are gonna headbutt each other KEKW
[2:58:46] Thoreya: kyrie gonna go to the lakers for westbrook lol
[2:58:46] Sollice: Start sending Mark Cuban DMs now to not take KD
[2:58:47] Thoreya: watch
[2:58:49] Blah206: Ayton hasn't been moved yet. I thought Kyrie was trying to force his way onto the Lakers
[2:58:57] Sollice: @Thoreya That aint happening
[2:58:57] Thoreya: apparently kyrie wants to be with lebron again bad
[2:59:15] Rottencoarse: so swap kyrie with russ? :D
[2:59:17] Rottencoarse: lol
[2:59:17] Thoreya: @Sollice rumors are it might
[2:59:23] BlinkHeals: anyone know if you get to start at wrath content or have to transfer/start fresh
[2:59:42] Rottencoarse: @BlinkHeals there will be fresh servers yes
[2:59:45] Klutar: in the tree
[2:59:56] Sollice: There is no chance of that happening. Kyrie may be toxic but he at least has more value than Westbrook. Unless Lakers throw in some other players. They dont have draft picks
[2:59:58] Klutar: knife in tree
[3:00:15] Klutar: cut yo self
[3:00:15] Kale_Nd: use it
[3:00:18] Klutar: use it
[3:00:20] Kisswani: you use the item
[3:00:22] parmesanchi: Use the knife homie
[3:00:25] mewkittymon: Knife is in the stump bye him
[3:00:29] Klutar: shake his hand
[3:00:29] Rottencoarse: @Sollice  probably they might add malik monk to that if Sacramento doesnt gets monk
[3:00:48] Kisswani: making a blood pact to get him out
[3:00:50] Sollice: The NBA now is what happens when we let players run front offices, run coaches, have coaching decisions take 5 year max buyouts and then after 1 or 2 years let them pout and get them out of contracts
[3:01:18] Rottencoarse: @Sollice  that's very bad business model idd
[3:01:27] Rottencoarse: it's started to happen in nfl also

[3:02:13] Sollice: DIdnt KD JUST sign like a4 year 140+ million deal LAST YEAR and he is demanding to be traded
[3:02:41] Rottencoarse: @Sollice  yeah lol and nba can't to jack shit about it due to 'player power' :D
[3:03:02] Rottencoarse: this started with the AD trade
[3:03:08] Rottencoarse: and been going downhill ever since
[3:03:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Season 4 in a month!
[3:03:42] Antoinas: i wonder how tune the WoD dungeons will be
[3:03:50] Sollice: Yeah..trade me or I wont play. And they give them 50+ million guranteed now. It was like the NFL where guaranteed money helped with players for injury. Now it's just a leveraring tool for them to get paid while they decide not to play
[3:04:08] Rottencoarse: @Sollice yup

[4:24:52] Zanmato01: @arnell83 they're two very different classes. Depend on the roles you wish to play
[4:25:15] mavericks312: and not all 100 ppl are devs most likely
[4:25:16] Korupcija_: I'm telling you all 100 of them are working on housing
[4:25:25] icerasta: They said they have been working on wow since may
[4:25:42] baloo_the_bear_: unless Blizzard had some contract work for them before the deal went through, pretty typical today of small studios
[4:25:50] Thoreya: lol
[4:26:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: They could do player housing, yeah LUL
[4:26:10] acebrown24: hey btw that technically is a scheduled change cause u are changing schedule right
[4:26:10] ashwing_: lel housing
[4:26:17] Crowargus: is there anything besides corruption that made dps dh single target strong in past few expansions would like to play dh again in df
[4:26:18] geros2013: But it means devs who are in  Blizz already can focus on the immediate stuff and have them more heavily involved in 10.1 stuff that is already on the.
[4:26:18] amazulu_: player housing coming soon, since 2004.
[4:26:20] Broomba: wow housing lol

[4:26:53] TwistedetaF: Fate spelled backwards lol
[4:26:54] RolexKT: I can dream of housing crreamCry
[4:27:02] Ahtilah: Player garrison was the closest we got to housing.
[4:27:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: and a dance studio
[4:27:05] Phil87z: I honestly can’t bring myself to care about housing
[4:27:08] thymos_: please with the housing ResidentSleeper
[4:27:14] thymos_: waste of dev time
[4:27:19] FresheFefe: but ma house
[4:27:25] thymos_: KEKW
[4:27:26] amazulu_: if you want housing ffxiv is decent. just doesnt fit into wow.
[4:27:32] mavericks312: players want housing till they get it and realize its not like they wanted it
[4:27:34] Broomba: player housing in wow will make Moonguard Barbie's Dreamland and Pony Stables a reality
[4:27:37] Blvdman: Not like dev's have been using their time wisely recently Kappa  @Thymos_
[4:27:47] thymos_: Kappa
[4:27:50] Nico_vdM: Durar's Cell? Duracell?
[4:27:55] abracka_: @amazulu_ harder to get a house in XIV than it is IRL
[4:27:55] Deadelus0: Dorfs aren't small! Just vertically challenged! Kappa
[4:27:58] temp3st98: i could see instanced housing in wow like how ffxiv has it so it doesnt be like garrisons
[4:28:08] miinajj: YEAT REP
[4:28:21] LazyJared: We have player housing... Azaroth is our home
[4:28:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Player housing would be an epic gold sink
[4:28:54] amazulu_: @abracka_ true, my FC has a house and I just have an apartment inside of it
[4:28:54] Blvdman: The type of housing player's want is legitmately 2 expansions worth of work. If they want something legit
[4:28:55] mavericks312: if there is no player power from housing most players would ignore it
[4:29:01] generaljosh721: Pls no house grind
[4:29:08] Dantte169: Got a house in FF and haven't logged into the game for 5 months, its still sitting there empty
[4:29:18] Artheneas: Like in WOD?
[4:29:34] Blvdman: %1 chance to get a trophy drop for housing Kappa
[4:29:36] abracka_: @Dantte169 hope you've logged in because it gets demo'd if you don't play for a period of time lol
[4:29:37] JediNeo99999: SWTOR strongholds were an ok start
[4:29:39] amazulu_: @Dantte169 same but I have a bed and some other stuff in it.
[4:29:47] generaljosh721: Osrs housing is the best housing implementation imo

[4:29:58] PvtHudson093: I want to be able to show off my fave armour sets and put weapons and shields on the walls
[4:30:05] Artheneas: From a business perspective you would think they would've already done player housing from the possibility of all the microtransactions
[4:30:10] FresheFefe: a little shitty apartment in stormwind would be cool
[4:30:21] MOLAR305: and if you had the AH robot, you never left
[4:30:32] mavericks312: i need some section 8 housing in org please lol
[4:30:45] Vorgoz: I wonder if 10 man raids in WOTLK will become so popular it influences the Retail version. I remember how much i enjoyed 10 man back then.
[4:30:45] Blvdman: Wasn't the garrison issue also made worse due to there not being world quests and M+ to get people out and about outside of raid days
[4:30:46] ZeusDNA: Yo can I be a landlord in WoW then? People pay me for renting apartments? Pog
[4:30:57] PToastman: at this point in time, I would gladly trade a raid tier for legitimate housing
[4:30:59] gravess_66: the millions and MILLIONS!
[4:31:01] Decoy101: I would rather have guild housing than player housing
[4:31:03] generaljosh721: Asking the players what they want? No chance
[4:31:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it could only be like 30% of the players that really want housing
[4:31:04] falldrgn: I liked the garrisons
[4:31:06] abracka_: instanced housing is so much better than the system XIV has. it would be a nice secondary feature honestly
[4:31:06] PatchesMcPatch: Imagine if the major cities like SW were dynamic whereby as ppl purchased houses the city grew in size
[4:31:10] amazulu_: preach
[4:31:11] ashwing_: i doubt there will be
[4:31:11] falldrgn: but There was no way they would re do that
[4:31:14] boadeploy: i dont want that shit i would hate it to know developers spent time on it instead of raid tier or something
[4:31:15] keterych: Guild halls could be cool like in SWTOR
[4:31:20] mavericks312: work on more dungeons or more launch raids
[4:31:20] Sarocus: To me, housing would mostly be an excuse to collect more stuff. So im all for it!
[4:31:22] CosmicPooky: The best housing was in SWG where you could create your own cities in the open world - if it ain't that I don't want it
[4:31:23] Blvdman: 16 dungeons PogBones
[4:31:23] wziiii: wrath KEKW
[4:31:30] Breakthecause: Hell no. More Casual content
[4:31:33] Blvdman: LMAOO
[4:31:39] Blvdman: on lfr lol
[4:31:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Adding more world content is important, I think
[4:31:44] Korupcija_: No, I did :)
[4:31:48] PvtHudson093: Did you see the perfect title for being on Moonguard RP ream. "Fearless Spectator" KEKW
[4:31:49] StarbuckTech: the casual gamers would love housing. Gives them something to work on while raiders raid lol
[4:32:02] smashiii123: the game needs more than raids and dungeons @towelliee
[4:32:08] PhillyRhino: But I want a place to display all my participation trophies. :(
[4:32:11] BadXo: That would be absolutely terrible
[4:32:12] Tassiedvl: waste of time
[4:32:13] stresstest: rather not have housing if it needs to be a WoD Grind again

[4:32:29] supercoupletv: should I start playing this game first time ever? i know its old superc192Bersecyeah
[4:32:35] Blvdman: I hope the new updated crafting is what gives players satisfaction that they might seek from housing. I think its just an alternate progress that's meaningful for other players.
[4:32:45] generaljosh721: Just make housing a utility thing like it is in osrs
[4:32:49] LazyJared: @supercoupletv Do it!
[4:32:58] mavericks312: if ion could pull it off
[4:33:00] Blvdman: osrs housing is op
[4:33:03] Nico_vdM: They'll probably drop the same loot or similar
[4:33:25] Korupcija_: that already happens with 10 shadowlands dungeons
[4:33:27] Vorgoz: @towilee Do you think 10 man raids in WOTLK will become so popular it influences the Retail version. I remember how much i enjoyed 10 man back then.
[4:33:43] BENJII_TK: i mean tbf it wouldn't be too bad if they made mythics across every expansion and adding new mechanics to vanilla bosses etc atleast then it will always be fresh dgs each weekj
[4:33:44] grylz89: 10 man content is bis
[4:33:56] PvtHudson093: Have the 4 unused dungeons loot drop from the vault
[4:34:24] grylz89: I play this game on and off for 17 years and I have never enjoyed professions, but I imagine some people do
[4:34:25] generaljosh721: I like money
[4:34:26] chrslp: Ive always hated professions lol
[4:34:33] grylz89: same lol
[4:34:39] wowking35: more bg 40 man
[4:34:42] PToastman: the problem with professions is people that take time off at the start of the patch/expansion just dominate the market
[4:34:47] ZeusDNA: "Introducing Player Housing with a new profession, Landlord!" @Towelliee
[4:34:56] supercoupletv: what are the professions used to?
[4:34:59] erdls: you cant, you need bop mats that drop from content to craft the good stuff
[4:35:09] geros2013: wrong mobs btw
[4:35:15] erdls: you can give someone your bop mats so they craft for you is the new system
[4:35:15] generaljosh721: Whales be whalein
[4:35:20] geros2013: its those elementals
[4:35:24] Aidler: I like the 4 old 4 new dungeons idea so that they can focus more on other stuff but I’m not a dungeon guy
[4:35:27] Nico_vdM: Arent it from the elementals outside?
[4:35:28] Sertrunku: you need the Sentrys, the elements outside the camp
[4:35:32] Korupcija_: if I can do it without tokens then it's fine, unlike diablo immortal
[4:35:37] Blvdman: I believe if they made the seasons shorter, that would sorta discourage token buying for power gains.
[4:35:47] loralahla: I'm really looking forward to professions and work orders :) I love gold making in game, and am happy I'll have something to pursue outside of just gearing and doing dungeons
[4:36:15] QuantumleaperGG: i liked proffesions giving power
[4:36:27] WoWRoach: I loved professions before WoD.  I had them all maxxed out and was self sufficient.  Then all of a sudden, everyone could make or disenchant stuff.  Farm their own ore and herbs.
[4:36:38] BENJII_TK: i think formyself i'd like lfr to be removed but keep lfg for dungeons, raidfinder kinda gets made obselete with just doing mythics tbf
[4:36:39] generaljosh721: If they pull off professions and you can make consistent gold from it then I’m sure people will do it
[4:36:54] Korupcija_: it NEEDS to drop from raids
[4:37:16] LazyJared: I really enjoyed Legion, that was a good time
[4:37:19] Unsungghero: unless it's a long quest like you needed to do to get Rune of the guard captain or Blackhands Breadth?
[4:37:19] Korupcija_: fuck them
[4:37:28] instant_savage: i want morw shit like court of starrs with professions
[4:37:30] Kize_Gaming: @Towelliee can I ask a dumb question ? It looks like you have 2 seals active, can you tell me what those are ?
[4:37:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: its a bug
[4:37:42] Blvdman: I mean if you had a world boss show up maybe once every 5 months for a blueprint you needed, I'd be up in arms about it too lol
[4:37:47] instant_savage: where u can buff grp and shit from being a certian something
[4:37:57] PToastman: non-raiders pay the same sub as everyone else, you gotta balance
[4:37:58] Deadelus0: Isn't it Righteous Fury and a seal?
[4:38:03] Valestrus: professions in pandaria good?
[4:38:08] thymos_: @HaxzorJimDuggan it's called hhacking EZ
[4:38:22] MikeyT93WoW: we love you towliee
[4:38:29] Deadelus0: Was responding to @Kize15 :-)

[4:38:36] Crowargus: as long as they make consumables accessible for everyone i have no problem with ppl having hard to get bis patterns
[4:38:48] jkitchin75: @Korupcija_ not very nice is it
[4:38:54] stk_fufu: Hi Towelliee! What do you think was / is the most fun expansion of WoW until now? :)
[4:39:02] loralahla: I don't mind if a few mats require going into raid or dungeons. But so many people want more world/4th pillar content that I hope it's not majority available in instanced content
[4:39:18] countrycount: random spawn of worldbosses fucked it over
[4:39:25] dergNwolf: wasn't that because they changed the world bosses to be random instead of a set order
[4:39:29] MOLAR305: Lies, BFA based on hours played
[4:39:35] countrycount: just really bad luck
[4:39:39] Korupcija_: he didn't say wrong answers only
[4:39:39] thymos_: mop  kinda
[4:39:49] Blvdman: They never discussed it, but they finally fixed it. The people who got R3 Day 1 made bank as they could multi proc pots, while us R2 plebs lost money lol
[4:39:54] gravess_66: Wont lie i miss BFA. Corruption and boralus harbor music
[4:40:20] wowking35: not me i hated that bs
[4:40:21] BENJII_TK: @gravess_66 no
[4:40:38] loralahla: I'm probably foolishly optimistic about it
[4:40:38] BENJII_TK: @gravess_66 the music was banging tho
[4:40:48] ghost186_: Did you watch the new Ashes of creation combat updates video?
[4:40:51] Korupcija_: they need to limit for sure
[4:40:54] Kisswani: I am actually more worried about the work orders . some assholes are gonna put sky high prices
[4:40:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: there needs to be a cooldown or something on work orders
[4:41:04] Korupcija_: "profession energy" KEKW
[4:41:10] thymos_: most of wow music are good
[4:41:13] Kale_Nd: or limit how many work orders accepted you can have at a time
[4:41:23] mavericks312: AoC alpha 2035 confirmed lol

[4:41:32] dergNwolf: one day they'll finally reveal the tulnar for ashes of creation. in like 2030 KEKW
[4:41:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: I watched the new Ashes stuff....their combat is similar to ESO but with more RGB/glowy effects
[4:41:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: AoC release the same day as Star Citizen
[4:42:08] chrslp: I know I'm a little late to the party but I just finished playing God of War on PC and man that was a fucking good game
[4:42:09] thymos_: star citizen still a thing  KEKW
[4:42:31] NieIas: aoc will never release LUL

[4:42:46] chrslp: @Thymos_ I havent heard anything about Star Citizen in AGES and in the past few months for some reason its been EVERYWHERE
[4:42:50] ghost186_: But it is beautiful
[4:42:59] thymos_: @chrslp LUL
[4:43:09] keterych: It do be a beautiful zone
[4:43:19] rxdderz_: how it tanking in wrath? i've never tanked in "classic" so only used to the face rolling big pulls in m+ LUL
[4:43:23] ZeusDNA: He just did a video of him doing combat
[4:43:26] chrslp: The other space game that died was Elite Dangerous. Havent heard a peep about that game in forever
[4:43:27] ghost186_: It was just them showing off the new combat updates
[4:43:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was a video demo, they didn't show the UI just some of the combat animations
[4:43:48] PvtHudson093: I skipped Grizzly and went from Basin to Storm peaks
[4:43:48] Korupcija_: it was so good
[4:43:49] NBK_Sethus: yea they were demonstrating melee attacks, speed and impact, etc
[4:43:52] chrslp: I love the idea of space games but man it seems every one that comes out is a perma-beta sort of thing
[4:44:01] kevlar9406: their combat actually looks GOOD af
[4:44:04] ZeusDNA: Personally from what I saw, it looked decent. I know it will get cleaned up and look way nicer on launch
[4:44:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, they can move while attacking now
[4:44:56] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[4:45:17] keterych: Combat looked like BDO lite to me
[4:46:17] ZeusDNA: I'm hoping that their dynamic world they are shooting for works. I'd love to play and feel my actions helped shape the world I play in. A world I can show a youngin and be like "You see that there, I helped shape that area back in the raid of 2026 against that dang fire nation."
[4:46:36] iknowido: Will most of the classic community play wrath classic
[4:46:48] chrslp: Has there been any word on if theyre going to end up putting a quest helper in or is it back to Questie/Zygor?
[4:46:58] mayonaes: Have they even announced a beta for Ashes?
[4:46:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is a lot like ESO and BDO combat, an action style
[4:47:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: quest helper is back in just not in beta now
[4:47:14] chrslp: Ah good
[4:47:21] net_mi: what about dungeon finder?
[4:47:50] chrslp: Theres really no reason not to have one in the game
[4:48:02] net_mi: wish it was in
[4:48:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3LydR8VssY ashes video
[4:48:16] amazulu_: not a fan of the new finder

[4:48:55] lithium364: Kappa
[4:49:02] Korupcija_: you're the only one in here that has beta KEKW
[4:49:05] ghost186_: Can I post ashes link?
[4:49:19] mitchplaysgamez: so they reverted the no quest helper?
[4:49:26] rawrforest: tru
[4:49:38] mayonaes: @Crowharrick Geez, so we are looking at at least another 2 years
[4:49:44] xALcaPWNedx: Is Wrath where they stop making classic releases?
[4:49:45] ghost186_: @HaxzorJimDuggan This is the video and fast forward to 6 min in
[4:49:52] WingsDub: doesnt questie do the exact same thing and allows people to choose tho?
[4:49:57] Fugazi811: @mitchplaysgamez yea blue post 2 days ago
[4:50:14] Crowharrick: @mayonaes I'd say, yep
[4:50:18] BENJII_TK: i wonder if gs is gonna make a comeback in this then

[4:50:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: He uses a 2h weapon and daggers
[4:50:58] cruzeal: what you reacting to
[4:50:59] NieIas: meh
[4:51:04] thymos_: eh still weird
[4:51:11] Crowharrick: The sound is chunky
[4:51:13] keterych: Still a bit weird
[4:51:21] erdls: the art style doesnt have any uniqueness for me
[4:51:26] chrispychick3n: combat needs some more juice and crunchiness
[4:51:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's decent but it's still a little rough
[4:51:29] NBK_Sethus: wish it was a bit slower and smoother
[4:51:30] mayonaes: 32 years later they have a guy swinging a sword
[4:51:31] Araphas: it's better than it was before
[4:51:32] mayonaes: cool
[4:51:36] Vernash_: sound is always later in production, have to time it to match animations
[4:51:39] DABZ16: i think it has potential but i think it should slow down to be less bdo like
[4:51:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: God, I hate spin 2 win
[4:51:47] OnceAMoose: They are trying to integrate the weight of the weapons into the attack movement style.
[4:51:49] ghost186_: just daggers and 2 hand sword
[4:51:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna have to be mind blowing if they want to be a monthly sub, its not their yet for me
[4:52:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: there
[4:52:06] ghost186_: They said this will only be improved upon
[4:52:07] Kaoticc1: I like tab targeting and WoW just does it so perfectly
[4:52:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: The dagger stuff looks neat
[4:52:48] cabalish: have u seen new star ocean ?
[4:52:57] mitchplaysgamez: looks better but i think they will run into new world issue where all the spell effects go crazy
[4:53:05] Crowharrick: Unmute the combat, you might get a more complete picture
[4:53:28] DABZ16: i dont think combat has to be amazing. If the game is good combat just has to be decent and usable
[4:53:30] thesegrimeytimes: the second story was legit
[4:53:32] Magnarius: star ocean 1 and 2 are the best after that it is meh
[4:53:40] nintendyoh: 5 hours in and level 75 already?

[4:54:57] Turet78: small tree in the big ass tree
[4:55:12] MrGharr: what is /played?
[4:55:41] Brodih_: he played the beta on multiple days, but not full 8h sessions
[4:55:49] ataflo: so shiny
[4:55:49] PToastman: war, war never changes
[4:55:52] jarilrpg: this from early 2000s?

[5:52:31] manmower: DF release in 2022
[5:52:31] MOLAR305: @Towelliee Layout change
[5:52:35] TialePetit: @MOLAR305 Dragonflight is scheduled for on or before Dec 2022.
[5:52:38] CaarrotTop: they said its gonna come out before dec 31st 2022
[5:52:44] raye_gaming22: @Nosdunk24 prob staggered yea 1 month or so
[5:53:11] swervo61: top of the morning towelliee
[5:53:16] chrslp: I doubt they'll release it around Christmas time- no one will be in the office
[5:53:38] moofia1980: nevermind found it myself :-)
[5:53:50] silodin: Are there any talent builders for 3.3.5 available anywhere? i realy want to play around with it :D
[5:53:53] swervo61: the intern forgot to put 2023
[5:54:06] raye_gaming22: its november even taliesen said he talked to them and they told him its 2022
[5:54:07] Shadowlemur01: if they dont they have to sacrifice one of bobbys yachts to the EU
[5:54:19] Baladore: Their launcher
[5:54:41] CaarrotTop: Can we just get shadowlands 2?? I think that's what everyone wants Kappa
[5:55:00] MOLAR305: its an ambitious alpha/beta schedule, considering SL was april and still launched late end of q4
[5:55:08] silodin: What are the buffs you have active atm? the ones that last more than 1 minute?
[5:55:13] Velashen: We can only go by what they say and the launcher represents them so..
[5:55:16] wizlordherbie: Battle For Shadowlands is my dream expansion
[5:55:18] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  what if scenario: if we dont alpha just go straight to beta? i dont know
[5:55:20] emznev: what date do you think the release for dragon flight will be?
[5:55:23] Shadowlemur01: Yeah, but theres no major systems to balance besides talents to adjust
[5:55:26] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: HOLYYYYY COPIUM
[5:55:29] amazulu_: Press (x) to doubt
[5:55:32] swervity82: maybe because there's not alot of systems its not taking as long
[5:55:36] lithium364: so far along the expansion could come out tomorrow!
[5:55:39] Shadowlemur01: I BELIEVE
[5:55:45] TialePetit: @emznev No sooner or later than the date they choose.
[5:55:48] Murlock07: danCopium
[5:55:51] slysirrr: Will there be any more Diablo?
[5:55:55] TheRiwen: Not many systems to test like SL.
[5:55:55] NieIas: copium overload
[5:55:56] manmower: those dates aren't that far away, no reason to announce a date this close if you aren't fairly confident
[5:55:57] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: slootI slootCopium
[5:56:02] amazulu_: We've gotten two talent trees.
[5:56:08] dec_u: @Shadowlemur01 Lets not forget about revamped proffesions aswell
[5:56:12] GunkaBeast: flying will be broken on release lol
[5:56:29] Sylnus: Hello Towelliee, this is Mr. Co Pium of the Copium Reliability Council of California (CROCC). We hereby ask you to reduce the amount of COPIUM consumed in this twitch stream, else our Copiumgrid might suffer irreparable damage. Thank you for your time.
[5:56:47] Shadowlemur01: @Shadowlemur01 professions prosmessions
[5:56:52] Rocman: I don't think AP was even in the beta in it's full form
[5:57:06] manmower: how large is their internal testing team?
[5:57:20] lithium364: im actually hyped for the new zones
[5:57:20] Shadowlemur01: mr streamer, let me BELIEVE
[5:57:22] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  professions
[5:57:23] amazulu_: impatient people: "nah man just push it live, we won't complain"
[5:57:26] silodin: As long as prot pala works, it will be a good expac in my books.
[5:57:33] mrrazputin: new dungeons new afix new raid new tier set
[5:57:35] emznev: GIVE ME IT all right now and i will test it all by myself :)
[5:57:38] manmower: 2 interns could make all that in 2 months
[5:57:43] Broomba: test talents revamps
[5:57:57] NieIas: you need to buy some more hopium
[5:57:58] chrslp: Its all been internally tested and is within spec squadBF
[5:57:59] wizlordherbie: Stop listing things it's exhausting
[5:58:06] jippero3: I'm ready for Classic Dragonflight that comes out a year after Dragonflight
[5:58:09] Dystilled: Seems to be a common thing with players of blizzard games, OW players already whingeing about stuff in the OW2 beta, ignoring its a TEST
[5:58:16] PsychoWarren: @emznev LUL
[5:58:16] BearOfLight: my only argument is with the talents. how many of them are actually new though, many are preciously baseline things and many are current talents just put on a tree. not that it doesnt need testing, but i dont think its as huge as it seems for that reason
[5:58:23] amazulu_: imo March-Jun 2023 release
[5:58:26] raye_gaming22: well we saced 9.3 for that im right?
[5:58:48] emznev: FACTSSSS
[5:58:51] Defocus: legion was the best system for balance of powers etc
[5:59:03] notColt45: Did they say legos are coming back in Dragonflight yet?
[5:59:09] Broomba: and yet people on twitch, content creators, reddit, etc think they know what they want in a wow expansion and you just destroyed their little world
[5:59:10] ohnot___her: on some serious copium about bfa
[5:59:13] cahoots82: Well, Alpha should be soon so we can hopefully get a decent feel for just how fucked we are =D
[5:59:17] Cephyon: need 5 don't you?
[5:59:23] cipusanx: yea, i dont like having 90% dmg coming from borrowed power
[5:59:23] erdls: @notColt45 they said no legos
[5:59:27] emznev: 5?
[5:59:30] Velashen: It’s all speculation. We don’t know how far along they are. Also we don’t know how helpful previous beta tests have been. They may be more focused on internal testing.
[5:59:31] itjustfeelsright: hes there
[5:59:35] Rottencoarse: he's inside
[5:59:40] Kakotan2143: SO Speaking of Far along @Towelliee did you see that UBISofts Pirate game that they have been working on for 10 years should finally be out this NOV?

[5:59:43] deathanubis923: it is how Howard tested: it just works. 16 times the details. we all know how it worked out
[5:59:49] Dystilled: Yeah, this quest used to catch people out all the time lol, didnt realise you needed to talk to the dude
[6:00:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: The alpha is probably next week, we will get a good feel then
[6:00:27] itjustfeelsright: people naturally only listen to things they want to hear
[6:00:47] Beardstain: Happy Canada to my fellow Canadians
[6:00:49] NieIas: DF announcement was first expac were they didnt have gameplay footage
[6:00:56] emznev: Just get me out of shadowlands KEKW
[6:00:57] Defocus: why do we need a season 4, shadowlands is basically done what else will they pull out
[6:01:07] itjustfeelsright: you as well @Beardstain
[6:01:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure there could be a lot of changes during Dragonflight beta
[6:01:09] XarkoLP: they are listening!
[6:01:11] GunkaBeast: its going to be a shit show. 3 xpacs worth of procs all at once mwahahaha
[6:01:11] c0mmander_starscream: "We're 2 years away, Now leave me dafuq alone i need to go back to mai coke'n'hookers" - Ion 2019
[6:01:15] Velashen: Ion has hinted that they are further. They set a date in the near future. They seem pretty confident and that’s all we can go on.
[6:01:29] GunkaBeast: im going to enjoy it so much
[6:01:33] Joefoshow15: my thought is that this is gonna be a more polished alpha we have seen from blizzard, what do you think? @Towelliee
[6:01:34] MrGharr: SL had a pretty long beta, still did not help.

[6:02:09] emznev: a longer beta does not mean either that the game will be ready? SL proved that
[6:02:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: In the reveal the zones and stuff did look good, centaurs and ducks running around

[6:02:42] silodin: it's where you start all the troll quests
[6:02:47] lunchbox8669: lunchbox8669 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! pre order states will be released by Dec 31st... place holder?
[6:02:50] deathanubis923: DF talent tree is a big mash of old borrowed power from last expansions though, so no they just say they will fix it, just we have different expectation when and how...we have heard same Ion talks
[6:02:53] Beardstain: @Kakotan2143 well it sounds like you have good people in your family :D
[6:03:07] silodin: i think you loot one over there. i should know i did it yesterday lmao
[6:03:16] silodin: already forgor
[6:03:45] Joefoshow15: @deathanubis923 From what I have seen from the DK tree there are some cooler interesting talents that seem fresh
[6:03:49] Defocus: i rather have hotfixes implemented while playing it
[6:03:59] silodin: trowing shade at star citizen? KEKW
[6:04:00] Low_Tech: There's a sweet spot.
[6:04:00] manmower: sometimes you get things right, then you spend more time and make them worse
[6:04:04] novastrike92: still no Dragonflight Beta?
[6:04:25] MVRD: @akurekov  beta?? LULW
[6:04:50] Zippaya: someone said Zippaya?
[6:05:06] Velashen: We don’t know how helpful the beta tests truly are. I think people put too much weight into that. Internal testing may be their bigger focus.
[6:05:09] Drahque_is_rank1: @Towelliee not using shield of righteousness?
[6:05:11] silodin: Y'all still thinking about dragonflight? i'm here waiting for Voidlords alpha
[6:05:36] R2RHIN0: Has there been anything said on if we are getting more character slots with DF?
[6:05:44] Drahque_is_rank1: it's level 75
[6:05:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would like to see baseline abilities removed from the talent trees and something else put in their place, for sure
[6:06:02] Drahque_is_rank1: rank 2 is 80
[6:06:23] Shock0neThree: Shock0neThree subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 10 month streak! 
[6:06:54] silodin: even lore was winning in pvp, must be a bug KEKW
[6:06:55] Kakotan2143: @Beardstain Americans are good too , to say other wise is ignorance that cause some Canadians and Americans to be jerks and bigots
[6:07:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: They should give us more slots for dracthyr, yeah
[6:08:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: delete the mage LUL
[6:08:17] NieIas: just make a level 1 on a 2nd account to reserve it
[6:08:20] Murlock07: LUL
[6:08:26] cabalish: i think 1 new slot per server
[6:08:32] 00birdhouse: delete one of your 37 paladins

[7:15:29] AudioJaq: My opinion man
[7:15:31] destiny25: To be fair neither does Shadowlands at this point. They finished the story and now we just have to wait till DF
[7:15:34] Jarlan23: BFA could've been good but it had dumb stuff in it that made it bad
[7:15:36] Chadesh: it's all dependent on what you like or not
[7:15:40] Atem___: at the end of the day good or bad content is content

[7:16:19] mavericks312: all they have to say is they dont like the content
[7:16:22] TialePetit: ^^^
[7:16:31] Phonola: lol

[7:17:00] Jarlan23: bfa was the most alt unfriendly thing i've ever seen
[7:17:02] NieIas: 9.1 was the worst update after 6.1
[7:17:10] DouchebagLuke: people use it in classic?

[7:17:33] amazulu_: @douchebagluke its a new thing in wrath classic
[7:17:45] Chadesh: very few people ever use the lfg type systems
[7:17:48] DouchebagLuke: They have this in classic tbc...the same thing, people use it
[7:17:50] BearOfLight: @jarlan23 the most alt unfriendly thing youve seen so far
[7:17:55] amazulu_: in tbc classic we use an addon called LFG Bulletin Board
[7:18:05] Jarlan23: @BearOfLight PepeHands
[7:18:08] amazulu_: @douchebagluke not correct. this is not in tbc classic.
[7:18:09] Raln3: I think I am one of the few people who thought the Najatar zone was awesome.
[7:18:11] Utmost777: im pretty sure that lfg tool is in TBC classic
[7:18:13] Thoreya: can we expect any DF news in the next hour?
[7:18:31] amazulu_: there is a crap version of the original LFG system in the game that literally no one uses
[7:18:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: We do need more talent trees so that people can get their rage out of their systems
[7:18:58] akia03: have they released any more new talent trees yet?
[7:19:14] NieIas: now the question is how much did blizz pay Warmane for their source code LUL
[7:19:14] Thoreya: ^ no
[7:19:22] Berexios123: why would they do that anyway
[7:19:48] thefinalnug: so they kept the group finder tool?
[7:19:51] raye_gaming22: they gave up 9.3 thats what im agreeing on
[7:20:00] net_mi: I think ppl mean that blizz shaved the content
[7:20:01] D3m0nHunt3r666: but they kept saying it was going to be a normal patch cycle and ended up being a short one like WoD
[7:20:10] paravak: We had two major patches within the same period of time that the prior 2 expansions had three major patches
[7:20:13] sinlesssinner: we are not going to thank em for doing their job @Towelliee lol we kinda bought the game for moneys... and DF now is even more expensive. Its the strict minimum to give us content... and it was shit..
[7:20:15] mavericks312: and were getting a s4
[7:20:24] lucidakamaze: WEll shadowlands is undoubtably the worst wow expansion so far
[7:20:35] mo__ti: they gave up on m+
[7:20:39] mavericks312: @xolowlifetwo wrong
[7:20:41] Vendralos: @xolowlifetwo lol no
[7:20:43] mo__ti: and u know this
[7:20:47] DeanoTV: @xolowlifetwo False, remember WoD selfie patch? KEKW
[7:20:51] lucidakamaze: Tewll me any worse
[7:20:53] NieIas: draenor also had 6.2 patch with new stuff and people said the same then
[7:21:03] Mecabeast: i wouldnt be surprised if we see some nerfs in nathria and sanctum
[7:21:05] mavericks312: @xolowlifetwo WoD and its not even close
[7:21:07] Sioxx_: hi which professions would u choose for prot pally in wotlk engineering and enchanting are  good ?
[7:21:07] Vendralos: @xolowlifetwo WoD was way worse
[7:21:09] DeanoTV: WoD had 0 content for casuals
[7:21:11] Allemongo: you mean a campaign you can finish in 4 hours and a bunch of rares? OpieOP Just because we got content doesn't mean a "team a" was working on DF. we dunno
[7:21:16] lucidakamaze: Wod had good conte,t just too little. Shadowlands have alot of content. But not any good content
[7:21:32] Vendralos: Not even close
[7:21:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tanaan Jungle was not bad
[7:21:43] lucidakamaze: WoD had good raids.
[7:21:44] thefinalnug: how has your experience been filling groups for dungeons so far?
[7:21:48] erdls: @xolowlifetwo wod didnt even have m+ bro there was nothing to do lol
[7:21:53] manmower: nah there were those crystals to collect
[7:21:55] Vendralos: Castle Nathria was a great raid
[7:21:58] mavericks312: @xolowlifetwo slands has good raids
[7:21:58] lucidakamaze: Not shadowlands KEKW
[7:21:59] Allemongo: We had pathfinder in dreanor Kappa
[7:22:03] comp1: the dark days of wow
[7:22:04] raye_gaming22: SOD good raid copuim xD
[7:22:04] R2RHIN0: The only content in WoD was farming previous expansions for mounts
[7:22:14] mavericks312: nathria alone shits on WoDs raids
[7:22:14] paravak: Quality over quantity
[7:22:36] mavericks312: there was 0 quality in wod

[7:22:38] BearOfLight: WoD had the most amazing leveling experiance. - what about the endgame? - WoD had the most amazing leveling experiance.
[7:22:38] Allemongo: Foundry
[7:22:41] heavenphist: Twitter integration  = quality amirite
[7:22:42] DeanoTV: ye which content for casuals?? KEKW
[7:22:42] akia03: lvling was good in wod
[7:22:44] NieIas: im sure Draenor had more subs than SL at its lowest
[7:22:45] DeanoTV: 0000
[7:22:49] Vendralos: People always have a weird bias against whatever is the current expansion. Just wait until deep into Dragonflight and people will look back at Shadowlands as being better than WoD.
[7:22:50] mo__ti: m+ content was a joke in SL
[7:22:51] vimie: defending WoD KEKL
[7:22:51] akia03: gold making was awesome in wod :)
[7:22:56] Rudric_Ice: WoD pvp was good
[7:22:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: I spent hours a day in Tanaan, as opposed to like 30 minutes in Zereth Mortis
[7:22:58] lucidakamaze: Raids, Leveling, Zones, Lore, No need to do abunch of bullshit to raid.
[7:22:59] manmower: house cleaning, good for the soul
[7:23:01] racketpunch: The only bright side about WoD was the amount of gold that I made
[7:23:01] Allemongo: Garrison missions was peak wow OpieOP
[7:23:03] jerseyfive: free millions of gold was nice
[7:23:03] happyspot: leveling experience but you can't have that support everything lmao
[7:23:13] DeanoTV: @Towelliee TRUEEE
[7:23:14] mitchplaysgamez: wod>bfa
[7:23:19] Vendralos: True and real
[7:23:19] jorgoth: There's certainly a balance. I personally loved the story of WoD, but the content was so lacking because there wasn't enough quantity.
[7:23:27] GunkaBeast: lol
[7:23:27] LurkLimit: WoD was only good for PvP imo
[7:23:28] lucidakamaze: You know who have a bad time in shadowlands ?? no one, because nobody is playing it.
[7:23:29] mavericks312: @mitchplaysgamez put down the weed
[7:23:29] churrodude: 100

[7:23:58] gudzzo: loved the treasures and objectives
[7:24:01] Sollice: Do we have people getting high and saying weird things in the chat right now
[7:24:04] lucidakamaze: @Thoreya Even classic have more players than shadowlands at this point
[7:24:05] Rudric_Ice: WoD was a mobile game back then just claim your rewards that is GOLD KEKW
[7:24:05] ChiliMoMilli: You didn't like setting alarms so you could get up and do your garrison stuff. So you can get through the time gated shit?
[7:24:13] mitchplaysgamez: @mavericks312 can tell you dont pvp bud
[7:24:15] DeanoTV: @Sollice yes ban all wod lovers Kappa
[7:24:16] Allemongo: i to this day have never been inside assran

[7:24:22] Thoreya: @xolowlifetwo you literally dont know that LUL LUL
[7:24:22] segarth: lvling in draenor was amazing, took 1 hour with treasures and rares KEKW
[7:24:30] jorgoth: Garrison was also very exciting at first - I wish they'd have iterated on it to make it more of a hub than a solo experience.
[7:24:38] Vendralos: @xolowlifetwo speculation andy
[7:24:41] mavericks312: @xolowlifetwo do you have stats to back that up
[7:24:41] ceranac23: @xolowlifetwo hahah u are funny
[7:24:56] PvtHudson093: I wish I had 10 garrisons pumping out gold missions
[7:24:57] jorgoth: It could have been so cool to be a group hub or guild housing.
[7:25:06] Vendralos: lol true
[7:25:19] heavenphist: quality at start was amazing in WoD, then no content turned one of the best expansion (potential wise) to the worst
[7:25:22] mackoida: What level did you get the DK to?
[7:25:29] lucidakamaze: @mavericks312  check staysafe video
[7:25:33] Rudric_Ice: WoD would have been the best expansion if they actually did the content
[7:25:54] akia03: but legion sucked pretty bad till like 7.3
[7:25:59] Slinttu: !alpha
[7:25:59] Moobot: @Slinttu PREDICTION JULY 14th | WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-internal-alpha-now-on-blizzard-catalogue-327322 | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[7:26:11] Vendralos: @xolowlifetwo You mean the Staysafe video where he uses google analytics to SPECULATE on the populations of the different versions of the game?
[7:26:28] DeanoTV: @Vendralos trueee
[7:26:29] mitchplaysgamez: the dungeon finder= when you fix something that isnt broken
[7:26:35] Baladore: I just realized that DF base is 50 and not 40.
[7:26:36] lucidakamaze: @Vendralos litterly using Warcraft logs statistics.
[7:26:41] mavericks312: google stats arent the actual stats
[7:26:46] Rudric_Ice: see thats why we need WoD classic finish the content that was left halfway in its cycle
[7:26:54] gabbledabbler89: @towelliee that feeling of open world and world questing in legion was so fun when it came out. The assaults.
[7:26:56] Kale_Nd: i don't understand why they didn't just use the lfg system we use in shadowlands for m+
[7:26:58] Vendralos: @xolowlifetwo Which don't tell you all the players playing the game, only people who are actually raid logging
[7:27:04] D3m0nHunt3r666: lets just spam lfg channel just like the old days, its faster...
[7:27:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 7.2 was good
[7:27:14] notdiggz: and honestly if you had you legendary it was fine the whole time ;p
[7:27:15] NieIas: 7.2 was shit till the raid opened
[7:27:19] NieIas: to much timegating
[7:27:20] notdiggz: those like 5 people
[7:27:24] Jindo_ZG: Legion most underrated expansion
[7:27:25] moofia1980: i loved legion from a casual perspective
[7:27:25] lucidakamaze: @Vendralos there are alot mroe try hards in retail. So it does make sence
[7:27:30] cruzeal: broken shore stuff was pretty cool
[7:27:37] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Tomb of Sargeras is my favorite raid of all time
[7:27:40] Broomba: not too many healers leveling in beta
[7:27:43] mavericks312: @Jindo_ZG nah most ppl have legion top 3
[7:27:51] Vendralos: @xolowlifetwo There's a fuckload of people who play retail and literally farm mounts and transmog.. Those people are not being counted
[7:27:52] churrodude: @Jindo_ZG agreed, amazing expansion all around
[7:27:58] ceranac23: @Vendralos  alot ppl even raid and not logging
[7:28:10] Broomba: true
[7:28:10] BearOfLight: i insist the bad luck protection did not get fixed for me lol. prior to then going in a vendor i only got 2 legendaries, 1 on 2 different toons. both of them were the stand still to heal pants
[7:28:10] Vendralos: @ceranac23 true and real
[7:28:14] jorgoth: Wrath, MIsts, and Legion. I can't pick an order
[7:28:16] Thoreya: or fucking keys? lol
[7:28:21] mavericks312: @xolowlifetwo tell me you dont play retail without telling me you dont play retail
[7:28:21] lucidakamaze: @Vendralos same in classic
[7:28:23] Thoreya: theres no logs for people that do keys
[7:28:28] Yofappafappa: just shoot me that beta invite, ill heal you through any dungeons @Towelliee
[7:28:30] Thoreya: and a lot of people do keys
[7:28:33] Rudric_Ice: would you take launch legion or BFA with corruptions
[7:28:46] Vendralos: @xolowlifetwo Come on, you know not nearly as many people are doing that in classic. There's not nearly as much stuff to farm
[7:28:52] Zerfell: They need more people in beta clearly
[7:28:52] mmrghost7: yeah this system is gonna ruin the experience for ppl
[7:29:11] Broomba: last boss transforms
[7:29:11] ChrisarN: just give us the group finder they released during wotlk...
[7:29:20] Broomba: last boss hits hard
[7:29:39] dicksosa: accept!
[7:29:45] Jindo_ZG: Heroes of the Storm twitter account hasn't made a post in 5 months, depressing
[7:29:52] Vendralos: @xolowlifetwo I'm not saying retail has way more players than classic btw, I'm just saying people underestimate how many people are still playing retail
[7:29:55] jorgoth: I'm ootl a bit, having just kind of returned. I followed story while away from game, but what are people thinking of story now that everything has come to a conclusion? I just recently finished the Sylvanas ark stuff and quite liked it and was hoping for a redemption.
[7:30:06] notColt45: Heroes of the storm still has developers? Kappa
[7:30:18] dicksosa: actual recognition of another char.. the tool is working Kappa
[7:30:34] Rudric_Ice: @notColt45  its a no kappa bro they actually dont
[7:30:40] lucidakamaze: @Vendralos true, i know alot are playing retail. But so are classsic, Leveling etc. I just think people play retail for different reasons
[7:30:55] ChrisarN: like Max 32 players on the beta
[7:30:57] Korupcija_: 40 more min, I'm so hyped
[7:31:07] Broomba: check every other 20 min for beta
[7:31:09] Vendralos: @xolowlifetwo agreed, I love classic. I'm leveling a Warlock for the Wrath pre-patch right now
[7:31:17] lucidakamaze: Pog
[7:31:23] lucidakamaze: @Vendralos thats a good choice
[7:31:30] BearOfLight: @korupcija_ from when he said 2 hours for alpha?
[7:31:32] gamernick410: How long until prepatch wotlk you think? @towelliee
[7:31:51] theDirtyon3: Was anyone else in Max's stream last night when he leaked the alpha timing? KEKW

[7:32:29] BearOfLight: @korupcija_ mvp for keeping tracj
[7:32:50] lucidakamaze: @mavericks312 i do play retail when its a good patch
[7:32:50] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[7:35:01] mavericks312: LFD you would be killing the first boss by now
[7:35:04] AudioJaq: Hard way to judge it
[7:35:04] TheHamIsDun: @Towelliee what are you hoping to see in pally trees?

[7:36:34] Rudric_Ice: sry chat im on COPIUM
[7:36:34] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee i wonder what will they do now that we can only do the same heroic one time a day, when in wotlk we could do them multiple times through dungeon finder
[7:36:37] stabzmcgeee: @Rudric_Ice pass the hopuim man, im drying up
[7:36:42] akia03: aff locks are op in wrath arnt they
[7:36:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was watching one video where a  guy says unholy DK is the best leveling spec
[7:37:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: meta andys will take an hour putting together the perfect group to save 5 minutes on the run
[7:37:00] Furinax: That is just the same whit Mythic + tho
[7:37:09] AudioJaq: Yeah thats a community created issue; would be nice if that went away and folks felt free to play what they wanted
[7:37:20] hikaritd: @akia03 if affli has execute dmg, its op LUL I miss execute Legion aff :/
[7:37:44] Rudric_Ice: @stabzmcgeee cvHazmat
[7:37:45] user11214: KEKW
[7:37:56] Watts__: monkaS the sub reddit
[7:37:57] Kale_Nd: imagine cata without lfd, having to travel throughout all the world
[7:38:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, one Classic andy content creator did a poll of his people, and they mostly want LFD
[7:38:02] ChiliMoMilli: It just helps the dead servers get groups. It's honestly a helpful tool.
[7:38:02] Vendralos: Wrath is retail lite KEKW
[7:38:16] xeridan1: i hope they add it
[7:38:23] D3m0nHunt3r666: maybe not at launch but at a later date...
[7:38:25] lucidakamaze: they should just add it in p2
[7:38:28] Vendralos: pre-tail
[7:38:29] vic_ave: they hav to stick to there guns
[7:38:41] ChiliMoMilli: I mean fuck even on Whitemane one of the "mega" servers. It's hard to find groups sometimes. LFD would be wonderful to get shit done
[7:38:41] Jindo_ZG: Why do you need LFD when we have LFG tool in BC
[7:38:42] Maydie6066: @Towelliee it annoys me to the end of the world that the devs dont want it to be wrath, they want it to be vanilla classic in the wrath world
[7:38:43] turbofreee: turbofreee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! 
[7:38:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: if you don't want to use LFD there is nothing stopping you from putting together your own meta group
[7:38:45] D3m0nHunt3r666: they are going to taste the waters after they know they messed up Kappa
[7:39:01] akia03: is lfr in wrath or was that later
[7:39:05] xeridan1: theyre out of touch
[7:39:06] Gamers_Choyce: i feel like the fix of their "issues" with it is to keep it same server rather than across server
[7:39:12] Berexios123: all i did in wrath was spam lfd
[7:39:19] Necrom93: @akia03 That was the end of cata
[7:39:19] Hitmanblood: I AGREE!
[7:39:21] mavros_kyrios: Any givaways for DragonFlight today?
[7:39:23] xeridan1: yep i spammed everyday

[7:39:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: if i talk to you in a dungeon you did something wrong
[7:39:55] Joostisis: Social aspect came from the server. It was ruined by cross realm, not LFD
[7:39:59] Beardstain: just because we play the same game, doesn't mean we are friends
[7:40:21] xeridan1: x-realm was the problem not lfg
[7:40:25] diskonferno: exactly

[7:41:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: yes
[7:41:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: its all the same sub
[7:41:50] Vendralos: Truth
[7:41:52] itscityboy: true
[7:41:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: GDKP and boosts
[7:41:57] Broomba: wraith babies havent grown up
[7:42:00] Manyfist: LFD was a godsend.
[7:42:04] vic_ave: @towelliee agreed we need LFD because this time around player base is much older and don't have hours to edit on healers etc they just want to go
[7:42:07] SpidercowSD: How did I not know this!
[7:42:08] Vendralos: The communities form on Discord anyway
[7:42:16] SoulToned: i lvled to 70 in bc and just didnt even bother with finding dungeon groups after that
[7:42:17] SpidercowSD: Installing now for funsies lol
[7:42:23] Herzenliegen: Classic was fun for a few weeks then everything went back to the way it is in retail.
[7:42:26] MrGharr: only the guys who don't even play classic cry about LFD community destroyer
[7:42:34] TheFrumious: I found it hard to even find a community that was inviting to join.
[7:42:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some people are let down by them working to stop level boosting in Wrath
[7:42:47] precision79: Boosters are dead already on my server. gdkps are all that remain
[7:42:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: people acting like they gonna get kicked from dungeons constantly, well if you get kicked constantly it might be worth evaluating yourself LUL
[7:43:11] Weeaboo__Chad: I don't get this. I always see people saying, "All these boomer dad gamers want Classic wow to be more time consuming because of how it was in the old days." while at the same time I hear, "All these boomer dad gamers want the game to be watered down. with more QoL features that ruin the game!! " like...which one is it?
[7:44:02] Herzenliegen: @weeaboo_chad It's both.

[7:44:24] BearOfLight: tbh, im just hoping that when they announce the bonus goodies edition for WotLK the mount for retail is the nerubian mount that lost to the tree when we voted
[7:44:42] Vendralos: @Manyfist That's a lot of people honestly
[7:44:42] ThaOriginalGamester: it's almost as if, you can't please everyone...
[7:44:46] dizzydirtyg: damn damage is nasty
[7:45:02] SpidercowSD: This is what got me into Raiding Was Wrath, I got picked up as a PUG Resto Druid for a Naxx run and was invited after and thus finally started raiding

[7:45:57] Weeaboo__Chad: @herzenliegen Whether Wow tends towards one way or another in terms of gameplat style, it's always "the boomers" that ruined it. It can't be both
[7:46:10] TheGiant99: @weeaboo_chad how does QoL changes ruin the game
[7:46:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: oh look someone had to drop now they have to run all the way out to summon, so immersive Kappa
[7:46:57] parallax3: This premade group finder they put in is night and day better than spamming LFG chat though
[7:46:59] zgag: @Towelliee Thoughts on the Mavs free agents?
[7:47:19] Weeaboo__Chad: @thegiant99 I'm not saying QoL ruins the game, I'm pointing out how people always say it's older wow gamers that want more QoL features, while at the same time saying that older wow gamers want less QoL features
[7:47:28] sinlesssinner: dont you bad mouth healers bro!
[7:47:33] Chr1sPbacon: which healers do you see the most in dungeons?

[8:19:11] ProfessorChaoos: Looks like shadow priest kept 1 thing from conduits atm
