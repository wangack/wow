You get your ultra bis stuff from heroics or vaults. You dont reclear , there isnt a huge power gain over 6 ilvl and also i strongly advise you to check actual dps values of trinkets cuz dungeon stuff either really close or conditionally better then them

You do not need any ultra bis stuff to progress and you will eventually get them. 1 or 2 missing items with competitive farmable alternatives from dungeons wont change how you performs. Mostly 500 to 2k dps increase at max. Those wont make your character parse increase to 90 from 30
