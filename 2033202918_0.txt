[2:01:34] warryvibe: naguuraBear
[2:01:40] Cudlla: key is over
[2:02:30] Sebleh: Just some of the way they describe stuff. It's not bad, just a bit odd. Specially combined with all the history the author is trying to build from the start.
[2:03:38] Lubbeliten: "Lost in translation" theres a reason for this saying!
[2:03:52] Sebleh: Yeh. I'm still giving it a fair shot, just gotta find time to keep going.
[2:04:12] IAmJoey: you don't need an evoker on fort week on 28 or below on this dung
[2:04:19] IAmJoey: it is about 30% more dam
[2:04:30] IAmJoey: from the other dps
[2:04:34] mrcritex: get me in there
[2:04:34] IAmJoey: that is not evoker
[2:04:36] mrcritex: fk bl!

[2:04:49] ImRelentless1: you take them only for deffensives
[2:04:57] JohnAllenCasts: DEV SUPREMACY
[2:05:00] IAmJoey: after the changes evokers do about 70% of a normal dps's dps
[2:05:00] JohnAllenCasts: it is time
[2:05:10] Aegatron: classic
[2:05:11] Sebleh: Pretty sure I've seen top M+ players have been saying you bring an evoker if one of your party members needs help surviving shit and you dump it if you need damage naguuraSip
[2:05:13] Kuroz: doubt considering fraggo is doing 30's as evoker and they're not thiking of replacing him
[2:05:20] filipgreen7: it is like 7+%
[2:05:21] Kuroz: 30 % he would have gotten replaced a week ago
[2:05:22] Mirxus: evoker do less damage but they bring so much utilities
[2:05:35] Paleee_: I think the actual number is ~10% loss
[2:05:35] Gemini_Tank: @Kuroz timers are free, you can sacrifice dps for def
[2:05:40] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and 10.2 guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:05:50] IAmJoey: @Naguura it is 30% because most evokers are shit.
[2:05:52] IAmJoey: that is the reason
[2:06:10] IAmJoey: if you have a good evoker you lose maybe 10-15%
[2:06:32] wulfgang71: will exodia be activated this season?
[2:07:09] ImRelentless1: lets hope not lmao
[2:07:20] Mirxus: was fun tho lol
[2:07:28] ImRelentless1: not healthy for the game
[2:07:30] ImRelentless1: but ye fun
[2:07:32] knowme_eu: on 28 Rise i had like 262k or smth on the log whilst evoker was at 157k on the log. i dont say the aug was like really good or smth, but aug is rlly not good atm if it comes to the timer
[2:07:36] ImRelentless1: if you played one of the meta classes
[2:07:59] ImRelentless1: @knowme_eu logs are still broken with augs in party
[2:08:10] Kuroz: hmmMeeting  ok
[2:08:35] warryvibe: NOTED go afk then try pear ok
[2:08:36] IAmJoey: Evoker gives decent survivability, with zephyr, the max hp, rescue, and insane group utility. But unless they have good EM and prescience uptime
[2:08:46] IAmJoey: you lose alot of dam cuz most evokers are bad
[2:08:52] ImRelentless1: +leaf this season the trinket
[2:08:57] Gemini_Tank: They boosty tanking and hjealing
[2:08:59] Gemini_Tank: with mainstat
[2:09:13] IAmJoey: if you have a good evoker this is of course not the case
[2:09:18] tea2468: good morning :)
[2:09:18] Pepeshammy: so lets go.. i play aug evoker from the star.. i can tell you that is exaltcy ass we say. support dps..is really good for high keys but you can leave also with out him.. has really good possitive things also really bad thing as all champ...
[2:09:20] nastye: vers only goes on dps
[2:09:27] chaarp: i believe the correct term is " they make the healer healier"
[2:09:28] Mirxus: they gives crit aswell, giga strong on dh and pal tank lol
[2:09:32] tea2468: :o

[2:11:21] ImRelentless1: if AA from s1 comes back with the same timer AUG evokers cant play that key cuz timer is too tight
[2:11:22] Sebleh: literally the talk this season is that it’s full of one shots and survival checks and not damage checks lol why would anyone drop the evoker
[2:11:22] IAmJoey: if you have a good evoker and a good team. you can pull more with an evoker as well. because they give you an extra 3-4 aoe stops as well
[2:11:43] yiendi: what is that 79min buff?

[2:12:28] mrcritex: the problem is, that most of them just die because or a personal fail and thats what slows it down
[2:12:35] gorby3004: and it isn't just the Aug's knowledge, but everyone else's too... If the DPS Tank and Heal can't perform well, then the buffs just get wasted
[2:12:57] IAmJoey: I'm just glad they nerfed evoker damage. it bringing so much shit to the key. imagine if they were still about the same damage as an dps
[2:13:39] ghostchief_: just casual 1.8m dmg no biggie xD
[2:13:47] mrcritex: they are wrong and twitchchat is always right!
[2:13:54] nastye: yes everyone knows twitch chat knows best
[2:14:00] IAmJoey: except for echo they don't need evoker nor do they need BL GIGACHAIR

[2:16:32] SgtDashor: you said,all tams in high keys have an aug evoker
[2:16:36] SgtDashor: all teams*
[2:16:50] Pepeshammy: is true
[2:16:51] Bobby2x4: just look at the leaderboard
[2:16:58] Bobby2x4: there’s like 2 out of 100
[2:17:01] gorby3004: lol
[2:17:02] Bobby2x4: that don’t use aug
[2:17:03] Aegatron: LULW
[2:17:07] reipan_: That's not necessarily a aug problem, but more of a "meta class" issue. You can replicate it to every other meta class :D
[2:17:10] Pepeshammy: but is not necessery to have aug on your team to push keys
[2:17:38] Aegatron: classic here we go again
[2:17:47] Faramonde: Faramonde subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! omg I just gave birth to our 2nd subbaby

[2:17:52] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[2:18:02] Maanae: Boomie's are the problem not augvokers
[2:18:11] nastye: @Maanae 💯
[2:18:17] reipan_: besides dps dying on tyrannical bosses :D
[2:18:23] ImRelentless1: on lower keys most evokers have 40% ebon might uptime and 0 rescue casts. On lower keys you NEVER play with aug as a pug
[2:18:25] reasonz0rd: SURVAVIBILITY MITIGATES MISTAKES.
[2:18:35] jaytherevv: Who cares what class someone plays everyone is bad at the game so it doesnt matter
[2:18:36] Cudlla: if you dont want evoker, just dont bring them into your keys
[2:18:56] reasonz0rd: so basically, if you go with Augmentation you are puting a helping wheel x)
[2:19:46] jaytherevv: Never Knew People Would Harrass Each Other Over A WoW Class
[2:20:13] tea2468: maybe they need to allow other classes to have similar survivability buffs so aug isn't so op
[2:20:13] movementjesus: @jaytherevv some people are just built different
[2:20:14] Sebleh: I’d be shocked if they bring Aug to MDI unless it’s mandatory for control in batshit insanely large pulls
[2:20:18] ImRelentless1: its online.. everyone harasses everyone sadly

[2:20:53] WoooTzZxD: discussion = harrassment. news to me
[2:21:48] reasonz0rd: @Naguura one of the things to have in consideration: In a team with 3 DPS, if someone dies and you have AUG + Another DPS alive, the DPS is exponentialy lower than having 2 DPS.  By other hand, by having an evoker, you lower the risk of ending with 2  DPS.
[2:22:12] gigakkarp: it's weird seeing some actual gameplay, normally you are afk at val Kappa
[2:22:21] golganarr: well, the inverse of that is also true. if pack die faster pack no do damage
[2:22:39] Bobby2x4: if both dps are hitting 20-30% more
[2:22:45] Bobby2x4: the tank and healer are hitting more
[2:22:53] Bobby2x4: and the Aug is still hitting 60-80k
[2:23:01] Bobby2x4: I don’t believe you’re getting more damage with another class
[2:23:12] Bobby2x4: I think the damage equals out nicely if everyone does their job
[2:23:19] brewticus: some comps dont need an aug due to the fact the specs they are playing are able to survive on their own
[2:23:33] MBG_95: Max also has said when DPS players feel Healthy and not worried about death, they do more Damage, which is why they 4 healed some fights instead of 3. Same applies in M+
[2:23:36] reasonz0rd: @Bobby2x4 now you adding hard conditions to it xD
[2:24:31] movementjesus: @Bobby2x4 top rio gamers are saying its a dps loss overall

[2:25:09] reasonz0rd: There is a reason why you dont look at log parses in dungeons, alot of variables in the table...
[2:25:09] Bobby2x4: go into a 30 with no Aug then and tell me it’s a dps loss when you’re getting stone cold Steve austined Every pull
[2:25:14] mrcritex: @Naguura just play warlock, trust me
[2:25:26] arthomgrosch: no healer is the best way to do a dungeon i think    for fun

[2:26:20] Kinraeel: i used to be in guild with that priest lol
[2:27:02] MBG_95: overall damage means more when you do what Dorki did and remove a bunch of stuff from Details tracking LUL

[2:38:05] tea2468: idk tho
[2:38:18] s3r14l5: @Kuroz ok thx
[2:38:51] dubz8888: the argument to damage isnt the make or break keys, is with more damage you can pull safer
[2:39:30] Paleee_: Naguura whats your prediction for 10.2.6
[2:39:41] s3r14l5: the most dont press buttons, they click and cant move

Download "csharp-release.zip": https://github.com/loic2665/HeartRate... 3. Unzip the zip file 4. Run HeartRateToWeb.exe (Must be run as administrator)

[5:38:03] sagamariia: even though i grew up with both
[5:38:11] nevernude1: My weekend was filled with football, laundry and cleaning
[5:38:36] turfjitsu: @oshiyi999 same spanish first language born in US  mainly speak english with no accent  but spanish is my first
[5:38:38] cablamo1: Whats funny is the definitions of 1st, 2nd and 3rd language. Where 1st is a language you learn from conceptualization, 2nd a language from your 1st and a 3rd language is a language learned through your 2nd language.
[5:38:48] gaminggshrimp: You will almost always have 1 that is dominant, but both will be "native"
[5:38:48] Kuroz: @ardsgena she can if needed to communicate, not on stream
[5:38:50] funkipants: I was raised bilingual in english/spanish, but spanish is my predominant language
[5:39:08] ardsgena: @ardsgena Ah fair enough
[5:39:20] sagamariia: yeah, swedish is the more dominant one for me so that's probably correct
[5:39:31] oshiyi999: maybe u could have 2 native languages but one is more fluent so u call that ur first language?
[5:39:32] funkipants: It depends what language is spoken in the country, that will be the predominant language
[5:39:46] ZephyrinDark: eyooo
[5:39:49] Xme45: Do you guys in Europe currently just study English or you study your native language and english ?
[5:40:01] nevernude1: I remember back with the OP guardian affinity on this boss. We were unkillable
[5:40:09] ZephyrinDark: cartoons taught me English EZ
[5:40:25] legjobb: btw, legjobb means "the best" in hungarian :D it's not leg job :D HAHAAHA
[5:40:28] sagamariia: @Xme45 english and native in sweden atleast

[5:46:55] nevernude1: When ever you change mics in the future you should consider a shotgun mic, they can be out of the frame (if you want that) and you also don't  have to wear headphones (if you want that).

[5:50:19] Aegatron: röde good stuff
[5:50:24] Kuroz: do you still have the elgato one to make a test one with that one first? hmmMeeting
[5:50:25] restobae: when there is no price its usually expensive
[5:50:28] b4bytaro: this mic is crazy. i work as a film maker, and we use it on set
[5:50:32] Kuroz: a test*
[5:50:33] Jacksprat47: the problem with shotgun mics is if you move slightly off axis they sound crap
[5:50:36] nevernude1: NTG2 is $270 for me

[5:51:13] nevernude1: Yea they have some that attach to the camera, rode makes a popular one that does that
[5:51:23] Hedylamarr_: Hedylamarr_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[5:51:28] b4bytaro: the rode link mic can be attached to camera
[5:51:28] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[5:51:31] b4bytaro: not the shotgun sadge

[5:52:19] nevernude1: That one is designed to attach to you type of camera
[5:53:11] Kuroz: if it's not good people will ask to use the other mic

[5:54:55] bitvolk: Well I started playing ESO didn't know if I should dedicate all my time to one single MMO
[5:55:03] nevernude1: There is also a pro version of the mic, idk all the differences
[5:55:12] nevernude1: I think the pro version is closer to 300
[5:55:14] nigelf664: @Naguura what is your opinion about Method Roiben knowingly buying duplicated tigers? Maybe if you saw the twitter post going around I mean
[5:55:19] Kuroz: english or german in chat

[5:55:43] Janeeboy: @Naguura Do you think Withering dreams potion is better if I have alchemy maxed out? (Over dreamwalkers). I felt like for pugging it is a lifesaver to set my health to max instantly
[5:55:46] StockerFock: +29 EB? WutFace
[5:56:38] nigelf664: Well apparently she knowingly bought duplications of spectral tigers to try to resell them to her viewers
[5:56:55] Janeeboy: @Naguura It halves the damage  it ticks down
[5:57:11] Kuroz: spectral tigers
[5:57:13] nigelf664: Like they are duplicated ingame. You do a game exploit so instead of having 1 item, you suddenly have two
[5:57:23] Kuroz: there was a hack back in cata to duplicate them, not sure about now
[5:57:31] nigelf664: @Kuroz In WoD yes
[5:57:39] Jacksprat47: aren't most spectral tigers duped
[5:57:57] Gnolde: why would I care?
[5:58:04] nigelf664: like there is screenshots going around of a discord log and roiben says that she knows they are dupes but still buys them and resells them to others
[5:58:16] nigelf664: A duplicated version can get you permanently banned for exploiting the game
[5:58:35] st0rmblessed__: @Naguura there is no problem its just a drama andy
[5:58:36] StockerFock: i think the problem is that shes trying to make money off of the exploit
[5:58:48] nigelf664: Yes, it is exactly the same, but it is gotten illegally. Back in WoD, THOUSANDS of people got 6 month and/or permabans for buying duplicated tigers
[5:58:50] Gnolde: "money"...
[5:58:58] nigelf664: @StockerFock Yes, exactly what stockerfock says
[5:59:10] cyaniide_tv: does her title update ?
[5:59:37] nigelf664: No, duped ones are worth way more since they are illegally gotten. She got apparently some of her fans permanently banned already
[5:59:51] restobae: look nagura, its a matter of demand. if you ask full price for you 100000 duplicates, you wont be able to sell all of them before you get banned
[5:59:57] restobae: if you ask low price, you can easy sell all
[5:59:59] CoffeeASAP: I'd rather people sell duplicated tigers than charge me 40k for a recraft LUL
[6:00:02] CitizenRut: There is no problem, y'all are ridiculous. A buyer unknowingly purchasing a duplicated item isn't going to have actions taken against them, and if they did they would be easily disputed. How or why would the buyer know they aren't legit?
[6:00:15] nigelf664: @CitizenRut She KNOWINGLY bought dupes
[6:00:26] CitizenRut: How does blizzard know that?
[6:00:38] sagamariia: how does even duplicated mounts work in this game? either its real or its not?
[6:00:40] nigelf664: blizzard doesnt yet, but the seller published the screenshots
[6:00:41] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and 10.2 guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[6:00:48] st0rmblessed__: this guy is spreading missinformation and should be banned
[6:00:51] Flapflapboom: you cna ursols them
[6:00:53] Flapflapboom: can*
[6:01:05] nigelf664: @st0rmblessed__ no i can litterally find it for you
[6:01:34] Jacksprat47: it doesn't even matter. it's an unobtainable tcg mount that something like 80%+ of the ones in the game are duped. blizz doesn't care, you shouldn't either.
[6:01:39] restobae: @nigelf664 send me pls
[6:01:50] Flapflapboom: If you time typhon perfectly that works too when theyre midair naguuraHypers
[6:01:57] EvenFrog: its just not a good pull. You cant pull 2 at the same time ever because they oneshot you. Naowh for example cage the 2nd stinger for 3-4 sec and then he pulls the other
[6:02:04] nevernude1: Are the people buying them getting the physical TCG card? or just getting sent a code?
[6:02:11] nigelf664: They look exactly the same, but they are put into the game illegally
[6:02:14] Kuroz: there's an easy fix : twitch prime drop in 2 months hmmMeeting
[6:02:19] CitizenRut: Idk, I joined late but seems silly. There were TONS of obviously duped mounts on the AH all through WoD. The prices tanked on them. No one was getting in trouble for buying them in that case. But I'm obviously missing context I guess.
[6:02:28] Molkohr: @Kuroz hmmMeeting
[6:02:29] phetality: who even cares what roiben is doing though. If they get banned, who cares? That's their problem
[6:02:41] Sianzu: It was a TGC card code that you give. That was one way
[6:02:45] hackiii: illegal activities nope
[6:02:46] Grillyo: Sort of, cause the credentials have to match
[6:03:00] st0rmblessed__: @Naguura no its a trading card game mount not buying accounts
[6:03:01] nevernude1: They only mount I want, is the rooster mount
[6:03:24] Jacksprat47: swift spectral tiger is boe
[6:03:29] Jacksprat47: you can trade the item
[6:03:29] Sianzu: Not if its a code on a TGC card that you can redeem. But those are ridiculously $$$
[6:03:37] sagamariia: her fans should just not buy them then, easy fix
[6:03:41] hackiii: SCATTER quickly hide
[6:03:45] hackiii: blizzard police inc
[6:04:07] Flapflapboom: Not necessarily, you can buy the tiger card, its not illegal
[6:04:07] phetality: @nigelf664 and then? If she doesn't care she's just a shit persom. Add one to the pike lmao
[6:04:09] Jacksprat47: the issue is that most of the tigers around are duped, and if you get one now it's almost guaranteed to be duped anyway
[6:04:21] CresdenN: Buying tiger is not against TOS because it's TCG code, not the ingame item
[6:04:25] st0rmblessed__: @Naguura you dont have to buy an account its a BOE item and it comes from a trading card, the guy made a baseless accusation to start drama
[6:04:28] CresdenN: ingame item is bonus to owning the TCG card
[6:04:33] Devrida: isnt this gg already ?

[6:04:52] Flapflapboom: I dont get how its duped
[6:04:55] restobae: how much does the spectral tiger cost nowadays anyway?
[6:05:00] Jacksprat47: @Flapflapboom bug to dupe boe item
[6:05:05] blueeyeddem0n01: @restobae prob a lot
[6:05:16] Flapflapboom: So it has nothing to do with buying accounts?

[6:06:06] Flapflapboom: its around 4000$ for the actual card/code from that
[6:06:08] Jacksprat47: @nigelf664 if you have proof they're selling it RMT, take that to blizzard, otherwise meh.
[6:06:10] Sianzu: Sodapoppin was looking at them years ago and it was like $7K USD. One of them was. TGC card code @Naguura
[6:06:40] st0rmblessed__: yes its a code
[6:06:44] Sianzu: Yer you buy the card with the code. Goto Booty Bay and redeem the item @Naguura
[6:06:49] Flapflapboom: ya its a code on a card that you have to scratch off
[6:07:00] gaminggshrimp: The original tigers yes, they are from a scratching card with a code you redeem in the account/blizz store
[6:07:02] Jacksprat47: @Naguura TCG game gives codes, redeem in game for two boe items. ingame items are duped and traded
[6:07:06] Sianzu: I dont know how you dupe stuff, so no idea on that sorry @Naguura
[6:07:12] SolstyceTTV: wheres ur plater profile at, its glorious
[6:07:14] st0rmblessed__: @Naguura there is literally no proof anyone duped anything or knowingly bought duplicates, its someone looking for drama in chat ^^
[6:07:32] Jacksprat47: @nigelf664 then take that to blizzard with evidence, not to random other twitch chats
[6:07:32] FareweII_: IIRC the dupe thing happened in WoD and it was something with mobile auction app. That's how i got my mount for 800k gold
[6:07:52] nigelf664: @st0rmblessed__ check your DM's, I sent you some of the stuff that got leaked
[6:08:05] nigelf664: So yes, it is a fact
[6:08:26] CoffeeASAP: why are we talking about this lol
[6:08:40] ooo_anima_ooo: what point did you put mushrooms into? I dont see you using it anymore.
[6:08:45] Sianzu: You're right. You cannot feign ignorance. Its very obvious something dupious was done to obtain it @Naguura
[6:08:45] Kuroz: no clue at this point hmmMeeting
[6:08:57] VintageLock: Hej <3
[6:08:58] blueeyeddem0n01: some1 got banned or whats goin on?
[6:08:58] nigelf664: yeah I think thats accurate
[6:09:16] nigelf664: @blueeyeddem0n01 its Roiben from Method doing RMT and buying duplicates and then crying or something iit got leaked on her stream

[6:16:37] pepinillopig: at least the monk tech works in atal dazar
[6:16:40] Flapflapboom: @st0rmblessed__ no dont think so
[6:17:16] jannekvarnc: yeah it might be attacking specialzation instead of proximity
[6:17:27] StockerFock: i guess its more that these are random and atal targets the furthest enemy
[6:17:39] StockerFock: or that
[6:17:40] jannekvarnc: yeah they pick random ranged
[6:17:48] imLoGiC1: hello how you doin :)

[6:20:02] jannekvarnc: @Sebleh ive played 5 melee in eb and couldnt bait one on range, it just picked a melee instead - since monk healer is classed as melee
[6:20:04] ikateyou: you’re tan compared to me

[8:48:25] Paleee_: I'm lucky enough to be from Greece where advertisers barely pay to be on twitch so I get 1 ad a day or something XD

[8:55:13] skeeld: cause theyre 90% mouseover macros for all my alts
[8:55:15] GrimmshadoXI: I bet you have duplicate macros in there cause you can't find them and you just make them again
