[4:27:06] mlbAct: @timmyshoes i don’t think racials matter ATON in retail, could be wrong though
[4:27:08] TimmyShoes: @GoSolarASAP shadowmeld is just too good for rogue. playing any other race feels like a disadvantage
[4:27:45] mlbAct: @chones2008 they’ve always played dif setups. basically whatever the metas good for
[4:27:47] TylerWave69: @TimmyShoes they need to get rid of racials
[4:27:48] TimmyShoes: @mlbAct shadowmeld is BIS for rogue and healer, it's much better than pretty much every other racial combined atm.
[4:27:52] samue_9903: DF is rhe best expansion of wow
[4:28:03] Johnykarate: @mlbAct its not crazy but there is def an advantage

[4:28:36] TylerWave69: @Johnykarate meld for rogue is pretty insane. huge disadvantage without it
[4:28:47] Kanooog: @TylerWave69 Yup - Makes no sense to have in the game
[4:28:51] TimmyShoes: yeah normally racials give like a slight advantage in specific scenarios, but shadowmeld is literally a game winning racial right now. busted.
[4:29:06] Kanooog: @TylerWave69 Same as R Druids
[4:29:17] Rhinosaur___: im making an army of Draenei women, I like their bootys
[4:29:17] mlbAct: @timmyshoes @johnykarate ahh ok. i haven’t played retail in long long time. since BFA.

[4:29:59] mlbAct: @arod_goated lol when u put ur name/realm thought you were putting a song name savixLUL
[4:29:59] TimmyShoes: @mlbAct yeah it wasn't as busted in BFA. but right now shadowmeld is the best racial in the game, and the second best racial isn't even as close to being as good unfortunately
[4:30:22] TimmyShoes: @Rhinosaur___ don't they have tails?
[4:30:50] mlbAct: @rhinosaur___ ayyyyoooo?? modCheck
[4:31:01] Rhinosaur___: I like those too
[4:31:17] TimmyShoes: it'd get in the way though
[4:31:19] mlbAct: @timmyshoes yeah but instead of a foot job (cuz the weird feet) they can wrap their tail around your well uhhh
[4:31:27] Kanooog: @TimmyShoes Not a fan of Arcane Torrent? I'm not, came back to the game and that shit was trash, use to be a silence. I had to race change to Nelf.
