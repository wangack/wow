[1:53:40] smolglizzy: Collections can be pulled on any character, Legacy gear can be sent to any toon (cross faction included) and you just pull the mods out gear you have and stick those and any mods you have inside the gear you want.
[1:55:05] smolglizzy: Blue and Green i don't think so. Some of the Purple gear can but it depends where it came from. I think its called the Artifact.
[1:55:11] Dyriks: I wanted to try swtor again, but downloading the game at 5mb/s should be illegal, even with p2p on.
[1:55:49] Dyriks: LUL
[1:55:54] lecrabTV: that lust sound was pretty damn spot on

[1:56:21] kharnij83: is the combat better? or still 10+ buttons?
[1:56:24] 91Niki: Good morning Towelliee and chat towHi
[1:56:27] smolglizzy: I mained sentinel and marauder back when raids where regularly released and I built a legacy set I would send between them to gear up from lockouts.
[1:56:53] Giantnoggin: Steam still uses the launcher though
[1:57:01] Rudric_Ice: at 5mbps ? do you live in a village or something
[1:57:03] DestinamueGaming: ^
[1:57:08] Gingerprimer: You can also play steam
[1:57:17] falldrgn: I try to play every now and then but I feel like im so far behind
[1:57:20] DestinamueGaming: but it is easier  on steam
[1:57:31] Giantnoggin: true
[1:57:43] T51Rezier: bom dia
[1:57:51] ClassicMalcontent: SWTOR allows Steam to download updates at least; even with it's own launched. ESO... I hate that you still have to open the ESO launcher to patch.
[1:57:56] smolglizzy: Steam uses the Bitraider launcher. You can alter the .ini file in notepad to force the hard launcher which can help stability on some machines.
[1:58:01] nephttv_: wake is always fun
[1:58:04] nephttv_: ill go warrior
[1:58:36] Deadelus0: I haven't noticed shit from increased threat on the bear

[1:58:57] 91Niki: LUL
[1:58:58] Darwoo: does swtor have low level dungeons to do when lower level?
[1:59:07] s_t_o_r_m__: Steam swtor installation recommended, faster download, alot more stable patches/expansions

[1:59:17] Rottencoarse: @Neph__98  you ready to face tank shit :P
[1:59:23] Thershunter: is there even a difference between steam and swtor client? Maybe steam cloud server?
[1:59:26] nephttv_: always
[1:59:29] nephttv_: comes with being a warrior
[1:59:45] ClassicMalcontent: @TheAkasura SWTOR on Steam still downloads bitraider but it is dormant on the\ Steam version.
[1:59:49] smolglizzy: Didn't they add the option to solo those dungeons now? I think it was so people can see the storylines?
[1:59:49] onyx_pupper: story is amazing
[2:00:01] TSquadSully: the dungeons also have solo modes so you can just see the dungeons stories
[2:00:16] smolglizzy: @ClassicMalcontent Ah thanks for the clarification. My info is a year or two out of date.
[2:00:36] Thershunter: Gearing is very grindy though in 7.0 atleast
[2:00:43] realdzs: story-veteran-master mode

[2:00:55] smolglizzy: It used to be Story, Hard, and Nightmare modes back in the day. idk what they are now.
[2:01:31] Thershunter: OPS still have a nightmare mode, that's for FPs
[2:01:35] smolglizzy: Master because Anakin is ab 4000 years from being born.

[3:09:57] stabzmcgeee: but season 4 doesnt bring anything for the casuals,,, if your dont raid or mythic + then you have nothing to do till dragonflight
[3:10:17] Reverez: I dunno, to only add 2 patches instead of 3, and also miss the 2 year deadline per expansion makes the end of this expansion seem underwhelming
[3:10:33] manmower: @stabzmcgeee does WoW normally have stuff for casuals? seems raid and m+ are usually the focus, with a bone thrown to pvp sometimes
[3:10:34] taintalizerx: theres always something to do as a casual imo lol
