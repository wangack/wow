[4:12:08] justbeachi: trindral nerfs are pog
[4:16:53] siversmith: Hi Jb do you use any software to reduce your latency for EU servers?
[4:22:59] sgtshellshocka: kinda shitty the bad guild will catch up to the guild who are 450 pulls deep on tindral
[4:23:07] sgtshellshocka: with those nerfs
[4:23:30] sgtshellshocka: so it puts like the decent guilds in a bad spot w/rankings
[4:23:39] sgtshellshocka: the nerf timings are kinda shit
[4:24:17] HeIIaAverage: wish the fire mages in my keys did dam like that lol
[4:24:22] FrostmagicED: I don't think it made the key free
[4:24:32] FrostmagicED: I also dont think waiting on HoF to fill is feasible
[4:24:45] FrostmagicED: doing it exactly 8 weeks in is a strict rigid half patch timing
[4:24:51] FrostmagicED: and it's good that the nerf is happening
[4:24:57] Lavathing9: @sgtshellshocka This will alway be the case whenever there are nerfs, guilds currently progressing will feel like other guilds can catch up now. But really, any guilds that are serious about ranks have already killed it.
[4:25:04] FrostmagicED: we shouldn't "cry" for players that were WILLING to kill the harder boss
[4:25:28] HeIIaAverage: there is nowhere i can escape raid talk lol
[4:26:13] sgtshellshocka: @Lavathing9 true, killing it tuesday post-nerf is gonna feeel really bad after 450 pulls
[4:26:24] sgtshellshocka: for guilds already progging p3
[4:27:07] Lavathing9: sure, but that is unavoidable. Same could be said if the nerf was a month from now.
[4:27:13] Esjames458: its would be cool if extending it would keep its current tuning
[4:27:40] Lavathing9: @Esjames458 no one would purposefully make a boss harder for them specifically compared to other guilds.
[4:28:23] ArchRaid: Any chance you could link the mythic + talents reminder weakaura you have?
[4:28:33] ArchRaid: or if anyone has an updated version for druid?
[4:28:44] FrostmagicED: I think they should make extending only work for ONE reset
[4:29:02] sgtshellshocka: @FrostmagicED  then all the shit guilds will never get CE
[4:29:04] sgtshellshocka: lmao
[4:29:46] FrostmagicED: @sgtshellshocka good
[4:29:47] midazj: midazj subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[4:29:59] FrostmagicED: 99% of the reason they never do is they extend every week and dont reclear
[4:30:11] sgtshellshocka: you realise that is gonna to cut the mythic raid base down by like 60% if that happens?
[4:30:21] FrostmagicED: reclear is important, pulling within your hours is important. If you're a 6 hour guild, you shouldn't be "throwing bodies at it till it dies"
[4:30:26] FrostmagicED: you should be using your time smartly
[4:30:47] sgtshellshocka: Good guilds extend too
[4:30:55] sgtshellshocka: it's just timing of when to extend
[4:31:36] FrostmagicED: most of those good guilds extend and kill it the week they extend
[4:31:47] FrostmagicED: I'm just saying, extending for a single week then forcing a reclear isn't bad
[4:32:23] sgtshellshocka: I actually thinking reclearing not extending, puts guilds in a worse spot for getting CE, if they truly are a bad guild that gets CE at the end of the tier.

[4:54:41] FrostmagicED: we're depletoing
[4:54:44] FrostmagicED: wolfaDespair
[4:55:30] Ancient_zx: @Hutheal Not realistically, even after 1st soft dr cap its still good. But obviously only stack haste, sim your character
[4:55:43] Ancient_zx: dont* only
[4:56:37] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:56:51] Hutheal: thx @Ancient_zx  i'm stacking haste mastery and i think gonna miss like crit or mastery
[4:57:42] Ancient_zx: @Hutheal Healing wise, haste and mastery are your best stats, but you still do want crit and vers. How much you need varies depending on how much you currently have, which is why its best to always sim your character
[4:58:15] Ancient_zx: questionablyepic.com/live to sim your gear for healing
