[0:42:17] Lazzius: @MPThemis531 It makes better use of rested and its still gear that you slap on and forget, plus honestly with all the EXP boost they are spewing at us, my guess is they didn't wanna make leveling done in 2h
[0:42:17] BigJustin26: like more or less?

[2:30:09] Stickybladez: Single malt Scotch refers to single malt whisky made in Scotland.[1][2] To qualify for this category, a whisky must have been distilled at a single distillery using a pot still distillation process[3][4] and made from a mash of malted barley. Therefore, a single malt means that the whisky has not been blended elsewhere with whisky from other distilleries.[4] As with any Scotch whisky, a single malt Scotch must be distilled in Scotland and matured in oak casks in Scotland for at least three years

[2:42:19] MartittaXoXo: @dreadshells any wholesalers you pay like £0.50 per bottle or £0.25 per can and charge quadruple that not sure on USA prices for soft drinks/sodas
[2:42:28] SaltyNivaya: depends on location, my daughters gym charges $5 for sodas and $3 for candy because nothing else is close by and when you sit through 2-3 hrs of practice sometimes you 'justify' the purchase lol
[2:42:29] loseorganktop: @Swifty  is arms betterthen fury?

[2:43:42] healergothboi: I’m in the same boat
[2:43:49] tazhyr: And you are correct in assuming the machine will get broken into, we have had several machiens have the front glass shattered, pushed into the machine, tipped over, etc
[2:44:05] Englesyn: $180 to fill it up
[2:44:21] tazhyr: There was a guy going around with a sledge hammer smashing in to card reader and pulling the money out
[2:44:26] MartittaXoXo: I at least quadruple profit on cans/ bottles

[2:46:30] 인터넷포트: I know a way to get the sodas at 36 cents a can so profit is higher. Go to the grocery store and look for the 3 for 12 bucks specials on the 12 packs of soda! Only 36 cents a can and u can re sell for 1.50 each can.
[2:46:35] HamHoks: electricity costs?
[2:46:45] kivinprod: count in the cost of fuel as well
