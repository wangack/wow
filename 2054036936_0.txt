[0:33:48] itsthingb: classic is slower
[0:33:52] xiClutchBoyix: Classic is insanely easier to get into, shouldn't even be a debate
[0:33:53] hughjazz8: Retail is so overwhelming for new players
[0:33:54] Cheatoy: but with friction it's gets larger?
[0:33:54] Gharthunk: Heard itvwas your Birthday!   Happy Birthday!
[0:33:56] peuwww: HUH
[0:33:57] shadowstorm_sod: Retail has to main gate keepers
[0:33:58] khanqor: I think as a completely new player classic is easier to get into just because it makes more sense and is easier to wrap your head around… once you install all the addons lol
[0:33:58] asloff: im clipping all of this out of context
[0:33:58] itsthingb: so makes it easier it think
[0:33:59] fanniclap: Going back to retail after playing for years made me feel overwhelmed. idk about ppl who start fresh on retail tho
[0:33:59] Rocketman1716: I was 8 years old and figured out how to play WoW @xaryu
[0:34:02] Mahca_: too large so the friction is not enjoyable
[0:34:02] shadowstorm_sod: Many*
[0:34:02] Yahfz: On retail, it felt absolutely extremely overwhelming, but on classic it just felt like i was doing one thing at a time

[0:34:59] P_h_l_o_x: 20yo bloat

[0:35:32] hughjazz8: Unless you live in a third world country tho
[0:35:35] scoodiescapz: do you mix anything else in AG1 besides water to make more palatable? I’ve read juice and milk, any other suggestions?
[0:35:35] 5L4Y3R: or get a job KKona
[0:35:38] Yahfz: it makes sense, but i think they should lock some of that content away till you hit a certain level or something equivalent to that, it gets so overwhelming that it scares players away, and im very familiar with classic/sod now
[0:35:43] g0dzilla: @curv6 thats rude, toxic and wrong at the same time
[0:35:47] PocketLotion: are there even free activities these days

[0:41:33] thedunnkrugereffect: The Problem with TwitchTV is that its run by marxists in California that dont believe in traditional western values and then fundamentally hate free thinking and speech. These people will portray them as highly caring, compassionette and so so good. This is the average tactic of the psychopathic narcisstic machiavellian. And then you have the twitch users and streamers that bend over for their tyrannical ways as they are easy manipulated. Be brave fellow souls. The revolution is near.

[0:55:13] fetza108: Cdew Sadge
[0:55:14] 5L4Y3R: this is the server tick
[0:55:18] Gosu_Rival: If it's implemented in the in one way or another and is access anyway; it's the game not the player.

[2:00:45] meurum2: I quit on shadowlands it was boring af
[2:00:46] Diabolicalz: Honestly. the attunements in classic were a good experience in my opinion. hyped up the actual raids a lot and made it more exciting
[2:00:59] lukemeleney: just alliance things
[2:01:03] sogmbie: o7
[2:01:10] thedonconn: @Diabolicalz they were a waste of time and did nothing

[2:06:27] SnackshotGod: @meurum2 yeah retail and classic are basicalyl opposites. add some of retail end activities to classic and it goes from really fun to really really fun

[2:11:03] a6msai: this makes me want to play classic
[2:11:04] meurum2: I haven’t played sod but in my experience I’ve been attacked by groups more often than solo

[2:11:24] tou0four: guys, what melee class sounds like it'll be the most fun in p2?
[2:11:31] panzerrfist: @tou0four warrior
[2:11:33] fabulais: @tou0four Warrior by far
[2:11:33] poiskd: warrior or ret
[2:11:38] meurum2: @yoslo1 shut up every race in horde is ugly af
[2:11:41] imvecks: @tou0four For PVP or PVE?
[2:11:51] meurum2: except blood elf
[2:11:52] tou0four: @imvecks probably both
[2:11:59] imvecks: @tou0four Rogue or War
[2:12:01] fabulais: @tou0four Both? Warrior
[2:12:05] imvecks: @tou0four For me, rogue :)
[2:12:06] bullorbear420: dont look foward too this shit lol
[2:12:08] asloff: @tou0four hunter is looking like a banger, traplauncher op
[2:12:16] meurum2: you all to deserve to die for being ugly @yoslo1 ttvzyrRagee
[2:12:28] Akompliss: True
[2:12:32] meurum2: alliance > ugly horde
[2:12:33] thedonconn: doesnt even press retal nicee
[2:12:35] tou0four: wanted something other than mage, thank you guys for the answers!!
[2:12:42] Akompliss: Yep
[2:12:43] imvecks: @tou0four It's preference also. As I personally think War is more fun in PVE, but rogue still slaps - but for open world , solo stuff etc, rogue is far superioir
[2:12:45] a6msai: true
[2:12:57] fetza108: i could play classic wo my whole life
[2:12:58] Akompliss: And people aren't helpful a lot of the time
[2:12:59] yoslo1: @meurum2 ez you’re so mad makes sense.
[2:13:05] ScryerTV: When SF HC??
[2:13:08] breezegodd: whoever came up with the WoW Quest puzzles must been the orriginal master of Hunger Games
[2:13:09] Nicholas909: fr im new to classic and its so frustrating
[2:13:10] tou0four: @imvecks i might go warrior, im new to wow so warrior always seemed kinda easy
[2:13:13] peanutbrn: I played classic now for 3 months.. it do be crazy hard
[2:13:13] Crunchee: @meurum2 haHAA
[2:13:15] limburgse: classic isnt easy ( coming from a retail annie )
[2:13:16] aoespawn: pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove xarbar missing u retail watchm7Mald
[2:13:17] jargly: rogue is actually a pvp class
[2:13:20] ehweron: alliance is for fugly dudes to feel like pretty girls. Horde is for sweaty nerds to feel like badass barbarians. End of discussion
[2:13:21] BarberSnipez: its easy to die in classic if u dont know everything
[2:13:22] a6msai: wtf lmao
[2:13:29] Hyelander_: Vanilla was tough because there was only Thottbot and few other website with limited info
[2:13:30] jimmy_irl: the brain rot is strong at this point in the series
[2:13:36] eddymm: that's is wild for me to hear people recommending wow classsic for people that have never played an MMO
[2:13:38] meurum2: @yoslo1 i got a group and we Ganked horde in stranglethorn
[2:13:40] justinshiroi: sod is my first time playing vanilla, definitely a lot to learn lol
[2:13:42] imvecks: @tou0four Wouldnt say warrior is easy compared to rogue
[2:13:44] Shanzul: Frustrating but also satisfying when figured out. More games need more "frustrating" features that can be respected after the achievement of doing it.
[2:13:45] tsetse2fly: @tou0four warrior isn't easy
[2:13:48] Akompliss: Lol
[2:13:48] meurum2: they did it first
[2:13:49] Kushiize: he just sounds like a retail complainer
[2:13:49] Cryptozow: I miss that, but they built classic and started adding all the expansions like before, dunno if those are tweaked though.
[2:13:50] fabulais: @tou0four Warrior is prob the hardest melee to play in an optimal way
[2:13:57] gurthurt: wooah
[2:13:59] tou0four: oh fair enough
[2:14:02] budmodeos: Xar you play any of the Batman rocksteady games? Thoughts on Suicide Squad?
[2:14:07] imvecks: @tou0four this is IMO
[2:14:10] poiskd: warr is easy to play and high skill cap to play super well
[2:14:32] tsetse2fly: wiping on Timmy
[2:14:38] Hyelander_: This hallway was a party killer
[2:14:41] Akompliss: No shot
[2:14:44] imvecks: @tou0four Dont get me wrong warrior is fun as fuck, but I prefer rogue. I think try both why not:) see which u prefer
[2:14:48] poiskd: its very easy to just stand and hit and press your abilities on cd, but knowing how to do peak dps or pvp is diff
[2:14:50] Akompliss: It happens lol
[2:14:55] Kushiize: trash
[2:14:57] carrbon_2k: afternoon Xaryu hope all is well

[2:15:26] fabulais: @tou0four They're trolling you kek
[2:15:27] poiskd: ferals prolly the most complicated/difficult melee to play in sod
[2:15:31] meurum2: bankai
[2:15:39] fabulais: @mercifultortoise Mods mods mods
[2:15:40] meurum2: = defeat
[2:15:45] Akompliss: Feral is so much more complex than Warr
[2:15:50] Akompliss: Still fun
[2:15:57] luthiennes: News  : King Charles diagnosed with cancer  for those interested
[2:15:57] imvecks: feral phase 1 is fkin easy
[2:15:59] Akompliss: Do it
[2:16:02] imvecks: phase 2 itll be more complex

[2:16:18] Shakezulah22: @poiskd lol wot
[2:16:35] Fastforza: LUL
[2:16:44] poiskd: yeah, its not -hard- rlly, but compared to other classes its more complex. managing forms and mana and your energy/rage is more than you have to do on most.
[2:16:46] mercifultortoise: @fabulais Just figured it has the same letters
[2:16:51] tou0four: ill try rogue or war

Kinda meh writing from Blizzard in my opinion. Too cliche with the misguided and bullied son
