[2:57:18] Liidocaine: Joel
[2:57:27] LoRswat: I hope they make Rag a 1 legged boss.  2 Legs would be too much like Cata.
[2:57:51] Motelguy: Predictions on what the new legendary item will be on SOD at 60
[2:58:13] FlowersAnger: My big big hope for classic plus is that they just flesh out the world more in general, add more instances, add more stuff to the original world, maybe find a way to include new races that I like, redesigning the classes/specs slightly (only some of them) to just make the specs feel generally more fun to play - looking at ret for example.  I remember hearing that the oriiginal dev team had much bigger plans for the vanilla world than what they were able to accomplish. Revisit that!

[3:01:26] FlowersAnger: There is so much potential for the original world taht they never got to before cata and then it was .. different.
[3:01:39] bacconader: Sulcum, third leg of rag

[3:11:57] Prowlerkp: if you liked the soda bread. you should try potato bread.
[3:12:10] FlowersAnger: anyways we can all agree retail bad I hope there's no retail players here that would make that untrue
[3:12:27] FlowersAnger: xD
[3:13:06] Prowlerkp: could make an Ulster fry breakfast.
[3:13:21] FlowersAnger: The very adult person haha
[3:13:34] FlowersAnger: I think it's great if you're looking for that kind of thing
[3:13:47] SkShuffleR: i give every xpac 2-4 weeks. dragonflight lasted 2 days for me
[3:13:56] Elijahszn5: are GDKP prices nutty in era atm? been a SoD andy lately but want to jump back into era
[3:14:11] thmpr324: itâ€™s great for a lobby game - sit in the main city and wait for raid/M+/arena
[3:14:26] FlowersAnger: YuO PlAy RetaIL!?!
[3:14:38] poggersshaman: better things to spend your energy on than getting mad at people for liking other stuff

[3:15:47] SkShuffleR: i log in outside ICC zone in for 80~ minutes then log out until next thursday haha
[3:15:49] FlowersAnger: don't*
[3:15:53] portugueseblood: funny enough retail is less like that than wrath, for m+ you have to make group and fly there
[3:18:13] FlowersAnger: The problem with retail is that it doesn't have ravager at a useful level
[3:19:20] poggersshaman: if u actually play retail u have portals to every dungeon anyway
[3:19:21] portugueseblood: you most surely wouldnt enjoy it ahah
[3:19:41] FlowersAnger: Ravager does 3-8 damage on retail
[3:20:07] FlowersAnger: yeah exactly
[3:20:15] Motelguy: Have you formed any stereotypes of wow races and the players personalities?
[3:20:23] portugueseblood: honestly the worse part about wrath for me was doing ulduar twice every week + too much progression
[3:20:52] Motelguy: Female Taurens are the most chill IRL
[3:20:54] bacconader: gnome rogues are a special kind of person
[3:20:55] ekiprkl: doesn't znips play a female gnome?
[3:20:55] gryphsx: stay safe D:
[3:21:04] ekiprkl: might want to call the cops
[3:21:09] FlowersAnger: The retail game feels like it's been slowly transitioning from rpgmmo to battle arena mmo
