[0:54:54] t3hfluff: How was you date last night?
[0:54:55] Knaxxis: @Zuldandi  yeah climbing rocks at night seems about the dumbest thing u could do
[0:55:03] RaizenHQ: Evenings are better for me. Your body is already warm from the day
[0:55:08] Knocktoff: W BASED
[0:55:10] SwiisH_Tv: i have sleep issues already. cant workout after 6pm
[0:55:10] oo7avenom: is oatmeal a safe carb for post-workout or not Im getting mixed information on oatmeal now @Xaryu
[0:55:10] Zuldandi: @Knaxxis have you heard about climbing gyms?
[0:55:11] slapshotsd: nah evening high intensity workout will make you crash super hard as long as you aren't doing a ton of cardio with it
[0:55:13] jaythestrengthcoach: I hate working out after a long day it's gotta be as early as possible for me
[0:55:17] pokemango7: yeah i love coffee before a workout, thats probably why i love morning lifts
[0:55:19] pjmenard: EarthDay
[0:55:20] KoldrexXL: What is you best loved Patch in Wow?
[0:55:25] evildufus: Stier advice
[0:55:25] chealm03: i just did legs at 3 am AU time
[0:55:26] slapshotsd: @oo7avenom in what context is oatmeal not safe?
[0:55:27] Knaxxis: @Zuldandi inside not too bad but outside ur asking to die lol
[0:55:28] lolzandis: i was addicted to coffee but ever since i started doing cardio in the morning before work i found myself not needing caffeine at all
[0:55:40] OpticProwle: getting up at 5 am to workout is optimal, but I won‚Äôt do it
[0:55:45] richardat1: good workout/excercise for low back ?
[0:55:47] commoncold7: Puts you in a good mood for the day working in the am
[0:55:50] slapshotsd: @richardat1 deadlifts
[0:55:55] tookotron: what are your thoughts on pre workout?
[0:55:59] heyimtazz: ayo Xar other than deep freeze what mage rune would you add?
[0:56:06] RoaminIrl: why season 13?
[0:56:07] SwiisH_Tv: it takes me a whole hour just to wake up enough to move lol
[0:56:08] stoneage450: have you ever watched Pumping Iron?
[0:56:13] oo7avenom: @slapshotsd they said it can create patches of random fat , and have long term consequences bc its not properly digested if not correct bran of oatmeal
[0:56:18] Dizzeyknight: been waking up at 5am for workouts for the past 8 months. ive lost 56lbs and never felt better ngl
[0:56:31] Knaxxis: they r kinda over doing it rn
[0:56:36] Knaxxis: like melee hunter
[0:56:36] MeisterZuk: Shadowstep
[0:56:36] trezzzo: best thing about morning workouts is the feeling in midday, when you trying to figure out at what time to go to gym, but then remember, i just had a workout in morning, so free evening
[0:56:38] bloodmana: But give us deep freeze
[0:56:40] LJimbox: rune: mage table
[0:56:43] slapshotsd: @oo7avenom definitely bad info, oatmeal is totally fine and there is no such thing as "patches of random fat" you need carbs after a workout to replenish muscle glycogen
[0:56:50] Erbsosa: yeah so if they have 19 how many will they have bby 60
[0:56:52] shmegflam: They should at least fill out the slots for runes
[0:56:53] Knocktoff: i feel its already been overdone, 5 second average kill times in pvp is ridiculous, we have retail power levels
[0:56:57] kaleeb_uli: Its sod not classic
[0:56:57] rocknsake: just make more runes with passive effects, so no ability bloat
[0:56:57] Knaxxis: i mean melee hunter is better than furry warrior dude
[0:56:58] shmegflam: thats the whole part of sos
[0:56:59] jiggeritus: SOD is already boring af
[0:56:59] Knaxxis: its insane
[0:57:00] coldyair: I think they should add a couple of passive runes
[0:57:01] Deomas11: Player Power is too much. It takes away from the feel of classic. You're meant to be scared of the enviornment
[0:57:02] espi: # of runes isnt a problem, its how strong they are
[0:57:16] naslund2727: They should add more passive adjustments and less new spells
[0:57:16] huckleson: im a classic veteran/andy and im done with sod alrdy. its just too grindy/boring
[0:57:16] boxhead66: Runes should start updated old spells
[0:57:22] boxhead66: updating
[0:57:23] haezel_420: they should have started with less runes and gone up, not started with so many
[0:57:25] Erbsosa: they need to scale everything more
[0:57:26] stoneage450: mount races
[0:57:28] Komekk: what spec u think is best for pvp?
[0:57:31] Knaxxis: yeah we r wayyy too powerful rn at 60 well just run throught he content at this pace @Xaryu
[0:57:37] amazonianshroomsniffer: the whole point is to see what works and what‚Äôs good and bad. it‚Äôs like a beta run @xaryu
[0:57:38] running_backing: i just want maelstrom weapons to proc off hits taken again Sadge

[0:58:11] jupitor24: more passive runes?
[0:58:11] conkqt: make arcane blast give you mana instead.
[0:58:15] eyepod: I feel like they are setting us up to play retail with all these retail abilities
[0:58:18] blind3d_: TRUE i am running out of keybinds lol
[0:58:20] Nooshbag98: even with my naga im like damn

[0:59:06] Komekk: what spec u think is best for pvp? i play arcane but the range is just ssooo bad
[0:59:07] Dizzeyknight: they gave you a QoL rune that increase duration of AI for mages which i find it nice. makes it a 45min buff
[0:59:09] anticursed: make a rune that turns living bomb into a 100yd aoe nuke
[0:59:11] kirk_hunts: the glove and boots on use effect too is another bind too
[0:59:17] warn1ng: i just submitted im running out of keybinds in the suggestions this am
[0:59:27] jujujay_myalias: I'm not just running out of keybinds, I am completely out of actionbar space...
[0:59:27] huckleson: @Tombah most classic players are far too brainrotted lol

[0:59:59] BigbadKevin: people will never be happy its either too little or too much. you can't make anyone happy anymore

[5:30:13] LightYearsAhead: @bloodmoon201 I got super lucky in Gnomer, I have 8 BiS items, I hit sometimes 1350 with Pyro
[5:30:19] sushileafbeats: @unhoLynx_ its not a macro... these guys lol. its an addon called 'Talented Classic'
[5:30:21] LonesmokerTV: @Weedweed we used to do the same in Classic too
[5:30:21] assrug: Weedweed it's sod not classic
[5:30:30] LightYearsAhead: @sushileafbeats *crit
[5:30:38] unhoLynx_: @sushileafbeats that‚Äôs another addon

[5:30:52] gnomiter: @Weedweed  i would run the same comp in classic

[5:31:02] bloodmoon201: @Xaryu I'm playing on fire mage, collected 220 SP, hot streaks, burnout, spell power, living bomb runes, one pyroblast does about ~1250 damage, I'm also planning to test frostfire bolt along with ice shards, on quick math damage is about ~1300
[5:31:04] Weedweed: @sarug yea i think thats the problem its really starting to not feel like classic in p2
[5:31:05] lazeeqt94: no what?
[5:31:08] adumb25: just hit 2 windfury and 2 instant lava burst procs in a row on my shaman lmao

[5:32:17] Weedweed: @sarug unfortunately that is the case as I stopped playing SoD for phase 2
[5:32:18] SavageSeb_: TBH there is no need for a imp Blizzard mage. Blast wave and coc slow is more than enough to kite + the dmg you do while not blizzarding is worth more imo
[5:32:27] MEDICx87: @unhoLynx_ it might Talented Classic... idk though i haven't used it
[5:32:28] unhoLynx_: did he just read my question wrong? LUL IM never going to know his talents addon

[6:52:02] LoziizoL: when is cata suppose to come out?
[6:52:02] Juicexlol: @xaryu you should do SODCORE first since SSF will always be there!

[6:52:52] olofdruid: Would play sod and classic if they just upgrade the grafics.. dont see why we cant have retail grafics in sod and classic hc
[6:52:55] savagedabs4623: at least there are two forms of wow people want to see right now
[6:52:56] Gashunk1: hardcore is gonna die you guys grow that branch
[6:52:59] canaduh88: @Erbsosa Its Hardcore SOD, but with no help whatsoever from others, I thinkkkkk
[6:52:59] morat_g: Ssf is like a multi month thing, sodcore p2 is much quicker so should come out first
[6:53:11] potatonator_: the way you say Rav, it sounds like you're saying "ass" in norwegian
[6:53:13] dorkasteri: SoD HC doesnt have that constant pressure. SSF locks you in to the stream, you could die at any moment and as a viewer you dont want to miss it. Lets be real, SoD HC is easier.
[6:53:14] Gashunk1: if you guys don't
[6:53:18] TuvaIaTimmy: @Xenocide321 SF means no RMT means everything feels way more authentic
[6:53:19] Erbsosa: ssf and hardcore p2 are the same thing no?
[6:53:21] eynesil: can u explain self found please ? @xaryu
[6:53:23] g0dzilla: @Xenocide321 cause its challenging and fun for some player... and content for viwer... so why not
[6:53:27] Juicexlol: @xaryu you should do SODCORE first since SSF will always be there!
[6:53:29] risettefreya: what is self found?
[6:53:40] Xenocide321: @TuvaIaTimmy this will just not be a thing at all
[6:53:45] Pixiepantss: oo im so excited for ssf
[6:53:47] Pixiepantss: i am soo excited
[6:53:48] roztoky: So neither is not an option?
[6:53:49] moflak: Does anyone know the addon for having to click learn before locking in your talents? I thought it was an interface setting but can't find it.
[6:53:52] Indomitablez: @dorkasteri I agree, at least until level 60 SoD is released then I would say SoD HC level 60
[6:53:54] maticqt: what is ssf?
[6:53:55] swifty1116: Already 3 bars
[6:53:55] moodona: what is ssf
[6:53:56] TuvaIaTimmy: @Xenocide321 ?? wym
[6:53:56] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: SSF made you!
[6:53:57] Erbsosa: what is issf
[6:53:58] lordhodza: Mail those gloves to hodza plz :)
[6:53:58] gary_ontwitch: game might be always there but the hype isnt
[6:53:59] moodona: sorry
[6:54:02] Slaughter13x: HC SSF ACTION
[6:54:03] mollymangomoog: what is ssf
[6:54:07] l00n425: its not SSF. that is the problem..
[6:54:08] myahkaho: Solo self found
[6:54:09] Austuhnnn: SSF= SOLO SELF FOUND google it
[6:54:10] illists: hardcore is sus
[6:54:13] Pixiepantss: kinda true LOL
[6:54:18] Xenocide321: @TuvaIaTimmy Any form of wow there will be RMT you can't stop it
[6:54:18] ftien17: whats ssf
[6:54:22] bagholderbrandon: 2v1 vs jahmilli and abn made you.
[6:54:23] Pixiepantss: it blew up a lot of peeps
[6:54:27] epikvi7ion: Very true - its why I'm here
[6:54:28] bagholderbrandon: dont let em downplay u like that bro
[6:54:28] Drayxtax: SSF on not new server is shit
[6:54:29] averymoistclam: thats where i saw you
[6:54:31] sengip: I didn't watch you once til Hardcore came out lol @Xaryu
[6:54:31] TuvaIaTimmy: @TuvaIaTimmy we literally cannot trade in SSF...
[6:54:31] Saadonis: Can you explain what ssf is?
[6:54:31] rpkxnoscope57: not true
[6:54:37] Pixiepantss: the hardcore addons were the best days tho
[6:54:37] Gashunk1: We just want classic+ not crossroads lich king
[6:54:38] Pixiepantss: it was so fun
[6:54:39] taylorsdank: you also made hardcore WAY better than it was imo
[6:54:40] Erbsosa: 2v1 vs jahmilli and abn made you
[6:54:42] tsetse2fly: @ftien17 Solo self found hardcore
[6:54:43] Ayjayyy: all that pvp stuff was just for fun. all sod
[6:54:45] Saadonis: What is SSF?
[6:54:45] l00n425: it's SF, not SSF. people going to get boosted by non SF players.. might be lame
[6:54:46] artsakh32: youre already playing sod (softcore) do SSF for variety
[6:54:46] Indomitablez: @Xaryu I would say SSF because you can play SoD regular in between as a break. If you do SoD HC then you are just stuck with SoD content
[6:54:48] pancake_mike: 2 weeks is a long time in WoW. SSF might look pretty good in 2 weeks
[6:54:49] wejden79: no fresh though :(
[6:54:51] quinoasalad112: i remember the retail days and that feels sooooo long ago
[6:54:53] risettefreya: @austuhnnn what is it? I‚Äôm on my phone atm
[6:54:53] PocketLotion: im just happy your not playing retail
[6:54:53] ctrlc__: consistency is what made you xar, ppc
[6:54:54] SoSoBurrito: you fell bro???
[6:54:55] SLAMMMY: want to play SF but group play only with other SF within a guild
[6:54:55] ThisGuyisLocal: how does ssf work on a server that has been around for like a year though?
[6:55:00] StruckWithLuck: i think id like more ssf but not on mage on something new
[6:55:00] swifty1116: Hey /played this level
[6:55:00] blacksocks242: is ssf hardcore?
[6:55:03] rpkxnoscope57: xartent is good even without solo
[6:55:03] Pixiepantss: truth
[6:55:05] g0dzilla: @Xenocide321, there are alot of games without rmt... so that is kinda meh answer :D
[6:55:07] miercoles_: is it not a fresh server?
[6:55:10] positiveteammate: sod is for geriatric old men
[6:55:11] Elsevier86: Your commentating on that hardcore pvp tournament got me watching
[6:55:17] sengip: @Xaryu  I never watched u til hardcore came out hahah
[6:55:20] eynesil: @xaryu please explain self found
[6:55:23] westernblot24: hey man. how was your Valentine‚Äôs Day
[6:55:24] Indomitablez: @miercoles_ It wont matter, cant trade, use the AH, group, etc.
[6:55:24] moflak: Does anyone know the addon for having to click learn before locking in your talents?
[6:55:24] swifty1116: Your at 3 bars do /played for this level plz sir
[6:55:31] blacksocks242: is ssf hardcore?
[6:55:31] AllieQuack: no shot i'm doing hc again
[6:55:35] miercoles_: @Indomitablez you can group.
[6:55:37] vroswrld: Hardcore all day lets goo
[6:55:38] swyftboi: as long as it's hc, we love it
[6:55:45] vroswrld: WE GO AGANE
[6:55:48] Tovone: i will watch whatever it will be YEP
[6:55:50] tsetse2fly: @blacksocks242 yes
[6:55:55] Indomitablez: @miercoles_ For dungeons you can but not real world i thought
[6:56:00] Kirnc: are you going horde or alliance for ssf?
[6:56:04] Wellequipped: ssf is really what boosted you from 1.5k to 5k andy? always thought you had great energy, is arena just that hard to watch?
[6:56:04] miercoles_: @Indomitablez incorrect. grouping is just allowed
[6:56:10] blacksocks242: @tsetse2fly thank you!
[6:56:13] Gashunk1: why can't they just expand upon the lore
[6:56:13] espi: who is Khagar and what do I want his whiskers?
[6:56:15] risettefreya: what is ssf?
[6:56:20] moflak: Does anyone know the addon for having to click learn before locking in your talents?
[6:56:20] Indomitablez: @miercoles_ oh really, my apologies I didnt realize that change
[6:56:24] ChattyPoppins: fresh servers are just always fuyn
[6:56:32] SLAMMMY: SF, but group play only with other SF within a guild
[6:56:35] disar27: how does he have mana bars in raid frames i cant in classic
[6:56:42] Playonwordz: That 12+ mob frost nova/coc is satisfying
[6:56:43] Kirnc: ssf wont be new servers
[6:56:45] miercoles_: @Indomitablez no worries, thats why i was asking if its a fresh server. if you can group with 60s it kinda defeats the purpose
[6:56:52] ScryerTV: I always liked to watch you but was hard to only see arena...this is so much easier
[6:56:54] myahkaho: What class will you play for SSF?
[6:56:57] g0dzilla: @Distrocto2 its a ingame setting opption...
[6:56:57] Wrestler: HC SoD p2 would be 25-40. Why not clear Gnomer then switch to SSF?
[6:57:03] Indomitablez: @miercoles_ Yeah most def, now I agree with you I hope its a fresh server
[6:57:04] saltdalt: i followed you cause in shadowlands i would watch you play mage pvp
[6:57:06] Dinomight3: @myahkaho @Xaryu
[6:57:06] Snakeyboylol: Ngl, i do miss the arena days
[6:57:08] sengip: @Xaryu  I saw ur youtube vids but never watched your stream til harcore lol
[6:57:20] daihenka: Thoughts on SoDCore where you can only use one rune from each phase?
[6:57:25] moflak: moflak is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Xaryu's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[6:57:25] alexrose7: asmon
[6:57:25] Pixiepantss: i remember the guzu demonic rune LUL
[6:57:25] moflak: moflak gifted a Tier 1 sub to rumathetat! 
[6:57:25] doronamo: crazy that it's been that long ago
[6:57:28] artsakh32: will you be able to group in ssf for dungeons?
[6:57:30] moflak: Does anyone know the addon for having to click learn before locking in your talents?
[6:57:46] GarlicCruton: Giga Shan was BiS content
[6:57:48] Platinum_bishop: Ew mitch
[6:57:48] Pixiepantss: mitchD <3
[6:57:49] SoSoBurrito: Guzu watching the Ozy death is how I found you YEP
[6:57:51] bushthebug: what happened to mitch
[6:57:51] Kirnc: ssf just prevents ah mailbox and trading
[6:57:53] sengip: @Xaryu  then u had a baby
[6:57:54] Pixiepantss: mitchD <3 Û†ÄÄ
[6:57:55] Xenocide321: all the cheaters
[6:58:00] taylorsdank: imagine a xaryu video explaining this last year from start to finish :O someone get on it.
[6:58:01] Slaughter13x: Tell Pika to play SoD he's a retail andy @Xaryu
[6:58:01] Valencia_Pete: mitch fuckin cheated like right away LUL
[6:58:03] sengip: @Xaryu  then Kai was created. What a wild year
[6:58:05] shloom995: Mitch made you all LUL
[6:58:06] CDank: o7
[6:58:07] ThisGuyisLocal: ah, yes. The cheaters of hardcore
[6:58:07] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: Yeah that was wild
[6:58:09] roztoky: HC SoD is somehow more intense and every step must be thoughtful... Like every thought is more worth ans every progression is more worth? What is you and chat's opinion?
[6:58:09] thebigdogg3: Summit too POGGERS
[6:58:09] dapps231: took over all of twitch?
[6:58:12] ScryerTV: wow killed wow
[6:58:12] MogiyagiV3: Playing HC now actually
[6:58:12] bigwhitepaw: I'm still hoping that Blizz comes up with grouping restriction: 'SF can group up with other SF only' - I know it's hopium...but still
[6:58:13] Pixiepantss: yupp
[6:58:15] keshi666: sod is fun and real hyped, but
[6:58:16] chrislu18: Started following your Priest series (op series) and have kept watching since
[6:58:21] sengip: @Xaryu  u had a baby too in that year
[6:58:22] exoswarm: HC is where is at
[6:58:22] Aidu_Eynul: HC would die slowly eventually good that SOD came
[6:58:23] Xarotic: wtf button is on s-4?
[6:58:26] exoswarm: im still in HC
[6:58:26] fewd111: sod should've released with hardcore imo
[6:58:26] em312: !followage
[6:58:27] StreamElements: @em312, em312 has been following xaryu for  9 months 27 days 2 hours
[6:58:28] Sp00kedEu: only fangs was a sad watch
[6:58:29] SgtPepperTTV: HC SoD when??
[6:58:31] Bankai900: won't ya give Granblue a try?
[6:58:38] morat_g: !followage
[6:58:38] StreamElements: @morat_g, morat_g has been following xaryu for  6 months 15 days 2 hours
[6:58:39] Indomitablez: @Xaryu Should call mitch and get a gifted sub bet going on right now. On release, first to level 40 gets x # of gifted subs then first to level 60 gets x # of gifted subs. All of it has to be streamed.
[6:58:41] canaduh88: yeah i stopped with classic once SoD came out
[6:58:41] Bikikoki: FrankerZ Release em FrankerZ
[6:58:47] bushthebug: @Xarotic its the icon for burnout
[6:58:50] Erbsosa: what is difference between HC sod and SSF are they played on the same server
[6:58:51] morat_g: Lines up, I've been follow for 6 months after seeing your hc YouTube videos
[6:58:51] Nich1294: @Xaryu is SoD what u expected from a classic+?
[6:58:54] Platinum_bishop: Onlyfangs was kinda fun but some people in it just made it weird at times
[6:58:55] Gashunk1: Classic didn't get expanded, we got to play with lego
[6:59:00] moflak: Does anyone know the addon for having to click learn before locking in your talents?
[6:59:02] seancyx: It's kind of annoyingwhen  streamers only play a game for viewership. If you like HC why  not just keep playing it.
[6:59:05] Pixiepantss: @Indomitablez nah mitch already did a subathon
[6:59:06] dan_mcpherson: what are the self found rules?
[6:59:06] Wrestler: Since you never cleared BFD in HC SoD, it feels imcomplete. Redemption arc?
[6:59:10] ctrlbeesy: ye
[6:59:16] iggy_pls: I quit retail to play SoD, its so much more fun
[6:59:29] dorkasteri: bro remember when you were trying to kill those dragons in badlands with Shannon. Stream had like 15k viewers then.
[6:59:30] steevwtf: sod got me back into wow, didnt think that would happen lol
[6:59:33] geennaamnl1: Honestly I think they should make a xarcore mode LUL
[6:59:33] Slaughter13x: Tell Pika to get off Retail and play SoD with the boys
[6:59:36] Snakeyboylol: @Xaryu you must miss the days of the 2's with Nahj, the non discord, synergistic vibes
[6:59:38] FullyMetalz: I love SoD, but I also love retail arena.. its so much faster and lots more to click... feels more like chess
[6:59:40] deathtxne: I kinda miss p1 tho, was comfortable in its own way
[6:59:44] BeastyBoy5000: From BFD into P2 is the best right now
[6:59:45] tsetse2fly: @wrestler he did clear it. He made 2 sod chars. One cleared.
[6:59:59] itstnew: p2 all the way
[7:00:02] Tactphul: do you think the 40-50 bracket will be able to keep up the hype from p2?
[7:00:02] Pixiepantss: all the runes making me run outta keybinds
[7:00:04] deathtxne: I miss boosting RFC, lel
[7:00:04] dumpdeer: the stv event is a lot of fun
[7:00:04] ghosey94: P2 > P1
[7:00:05] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: P1 was more casual friendly
[7:00:08] myahkaho: STV is so fun
[7:00:11] tsetse2fly: @wrestler sod hc
[7:00:16] itstnew: P2 > P1
[7:00:16] Pixiepantss: yesss
[7:00:23] tukz: One more week with a cast on my hand then I can finally play SoD
[7:00:24] Indomitablez: PP > P
[7:00:27] Pixiepantss: esp as a healer with different ranks
[7:00:28] radassbadass69: im doing okay on warrior for the time being
[7:00:30] icylemons1993: Pumpin' bro
[7:00:32] LemenTozen: but then people complain about boring runes
[7:00:34] YuraruY: with all the added on use items + runes there's literally no way to keybind it all
[7:00:34] gia__: they also added a bunch of new usable items this phase that take even more slots
[7:00:36] Elronmcbong38: the Problem with p2 that all ppl from p1 have Lots of Gold and stuff - Hard to catch up now if you skipped p1
[7:00:40] bluptual: i use 123456, cvbthgrf and then I also use my mouse wheel so Im good
[7:00:42] yoshii85: Trap launcher rune is sick
[7:00:43] olofdruid: Why cant they just upgrade the grafics for sod and that? would love to have retail grafics in sod
[7:00:47] Slaughter13x: Shouldve used a controller xD
[7:00:47] swyftboi: 1

[7:01:05] Slaughter13x: Just use a controller xD
[7:01:06] dapps231: how do you run out of keybinds at level 40???????!!!!
[7:01:07] n0lllie: weapon has a on use, helm has on use, 4 new buttons

[7:01:21] Pixiepantss: different ranks!
[7:01:24] BrandsGG: looking at my hotbar gives me anxiety @Xaryu
[7:01:27] morat_g: Control modifier, shift modifier, alt modifier, I got infinite keybinds bro
[7:01:27] John__Salami: imagine arena and focus macros..
[7:01:28] deathtxne: GearQuipper addon saved my life, cuz most spells u dont need for some setups like depending if u boost, dungeon, raid or pvp
[7:01:28] MONNlBLAST: 48 keybinds currently not enough for SoD
[7:01:28] ScryerTV: how are you NOT out of key binds as rogue at lv 40?
[7:01:29] KilladeathKS: rogue has 3 buttons xd
[7:01:29] bluptual: eh, binds for pots arent needed in sod
[7:01:31] tukz: naga mouse helps
[7:01:32] Philopinos: trinkets
[7:01:32] galbott: trinkets too
[7:01:33] jbroni: I think that because you lean into one set of spells more based on your runes, you should be dropping some spells off your bars
[7:01:36] spacetravelergaming: gear swapping
[7:01:42] acaman: allmy bars are full and im a rogue lol
[7:01:43] icylemons1993: look at that Dam
[7:01:44] morat_g: Ctrl, shift, alt, and a mmo mouse is like more than 100 key binds
[7:01:44] husky907: its not the number quite yet, its that i like to change modifiers depending on the spell and it pretty rough to do with sod's implementation
[7:01:45] espi: action bar space is the problem
[7:01:47] sengip: whats a mouse over keybind :(<\
[7:01:47] Pixiepantss: o yeah trinkets too
[7:01:47] winsong: you can macro cds for the most part right or are trinkets on gcd?
[7:01:49] bluptual: i can click faster than you can type
[7:01:50] LonesmokerTV: I dont use keybinds. I just click my spells
[7:01:52] s1ckneZ: classic andys overwhelmed by pressing more than 3 buttons :D
[7:01:54] YuraruY: u gonna stay up until u hit 40?
[7:01:54] Bikikoki: im playing with a joystick with 2 buttons, works great!
[7:01:58] icylemons1993: slappin'ton aeo
[7:02:06] Pixiepantss: epic tailoring boots

[7:02:15] alrik_plays: @s1ckneZ Retail has like 5 buttons and they glow like 100 watt bulbs whenever you need to press it
[7:02:21] dapps231: but do you really need all those keybinds??
[7:02:25] John__Salami: imagine arena and focus macros in sod hahah
[7:02:28] geennaamnl1: I have everything under 1 keybind this makes playing intresting and you never know whats gonna happen.
[7:02:34] ooTHExTUBEoo: At least you're not a warrior PepeLaugh

[7:35:07] maineack13: can you do this in library lower level?
[7:35:09] taylorsdank: I think they'll release a new auction house mount in war within...
[7:35:19] kasilo: Fun for a month or 2
[7:35:21] gorglinz: can‚Äôt wait to try hardcore
[7:35:25] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: good influx of noobs to farm in arenas?
[7:35:35] xXgennieXx: @Xaryu Can u bug under SW in classic still?
[7:35:38] Playonwordz: that‚Äôs what makes an expansion good is the amount of people playing it
[7:35:40] MakeASplash: yeah its usually really fun for a month and then you realize the flaws in each expansion
[7:35:43] kahrim82: shadowlands proof you wrong
[7:35:46] MalwareBaby: I disagree, Because the last 3 expacs were like 2 week quits. So the game is pretty much poopshooted to garfunkle
[7:35:50] waladinpaladin: Do you think you will ever get back into retail PVP?
[7:35:52] jackpepsimba: DF kept it solid for a whole season it felt like, was cool
[7:35:53] Caledvwych: Wrath kept for years.
[7:36:16] choikog: This looks so broken.,....but fun
[7:36:19] ninjuhh_d4: Wrath introduced SO MUCH content that stayed for good
[7:36:22] BLANKisLIFE: i knew you would hit 40 tonight

[7:36:53] Fiitshaced: yup, always fun for a bit
[7:36:53] reavethederp: df was realy good, and shadow lands was decent they might be ono the right track
[7:36:54] MrPankratz: yes, its like that in every mmo
[7:36:55] Neophyterr: yes, same with dragonflight. was fun for couple weeks because it was new
[7:36:57] rickksen: we all *loved*
[7:36:58] Peppyfoil69420: fr
[7:36:59] savagedabs4623: 2 weeks is so short for avg gamer
[7:37:00] desweck: classic best...period. :D
[7:37:00] radassbadass69: that's generally true, just being a part of "the new thing" is a lot of the fun for most
[7:37:00] c0gnusTV: shadowlands may be worst xpac ever started off as a banger
[7:37:02] ThisGuyisLocal: MoP enjoyers rise up
[7:37:08] ferroneri: the question is, is 60 dollar worth of entertainement for 2 weeks?
[7:37:10] peardraxz: I think they're really heading towards a train wreck with hero talents
[7:37:19] taylorsdank: cant believe there was a time where we were all level 120
[7:37:22] MalwareBaby: You think after SoD they would try an alternate Xpac timeline?
[7:37:23] HulkingPear: when has there been exp that has been good for years tho lol
[7:37:26] FurylordD: best comp
[7:37:27] thejiggler1: Mop #1
[7:37:32] Kolowavex: yo xar dog do you know if you can bug under stormwind?
[7:37:38] volr17: @Xaryu just bought the Starforge navigator pro!
[7:37:38] yarrpeter: @ThisGuyisLocal pvp was fun. Had a warlock which was also fun
[7:37:47] Madsdensejehomie: Mop best exp
[7:37:51] Squozen: mop was good for less than a week
[7:37:52] reallyeric: wait since when does jynxzi play this game?
[7:37:54] ninjuhh_d4: Gnomer tomorrow fosho now
[7:38:03] Zopex123: im loving sod

[7:38:30] Tovone: KEKL
[7:38:33] MalwareBaby: You think after SoD they would try an alternate Xpac timeline?
[7:38:34] shloom995: when gnomergan @Xaryu
[7:38:34] SoSoBurrito: do the math BLIZZARD guzuNotes
[7:38:37] Caledvwych: All xpacs needed to be 5s like in cata.
[7:38:37] sunnnn_: probably by the end of the saga we will be 100 and then its going to be another squish
[7:38:40] c0gnusTV: should go back to 60 instead of 90
[7:38:40] verbotenlime: wow 2 when
[7:38:40] andypandynz: they'll have a new system by then
[7:38:40] Zopex123: which level in war whitin
[7:38:41] JasperXIII: it is what it is
[7:38:41] ferroneri: they already talked about that. they probably going to squish in part 2 of the dragonsoul saga
[7:38:41] jackpepsimba: sub 100 level = nostalgia
[7:38:43] smoore48: already did the math for the 120 > 60 crunch so they just run it back when we get there again
[7:38:46] Knaxxis: i think they launch wow 2 after lvl 100 the thirs expac of the world soul saga
[7:38:47] Elvandel: They need to do a prestige leveling system like Destiny / Guild Wars
[7:38:48] Lukeker: They've done 2 squishes in the past, they'll just add another
[7:38:49] reallyeric: what do you want them to do? you HAVE to increase level cap on expansions
[7:38:54] Dogarian: HUH
[7:38:57] Playonwordz: @xaryu what I would love is wow but new terrain
[7:38:59] peuwww: HUH
[7:39:00] radassbadass69: doing 500k attacks and having 5mil HP turned me off legion so hard
[7:39:00] SebasDaMann: i mean it was that or we go over level 200‚Ä¶
[7:39:12] ninjuhh_d4: Any idea what time gnomer tommorrow?
[7:39:14] Playonwordz: imagine wow with new terrain. that would be amazing
[7:39:15] Qua_ds_os: will you play self found mode HC?
[7:39:16] skimansr: still going eh?
[7:39:18] reindeering: what if.. you dont get any new levels.. but you unlock new spells with runes! and that's how you progress the new expansion and you need the new spells to kill the new raid bosses. wowza!
[7:39:18] radassbadass69: @SebasDaMann 255 I think is the cap for the game engine
[7:39:24] demololtv: wait is xaryu actually gunnu hit 40
[7:39:26] HulkingPear: they need to just make a new game  like Warcraft3-> wow, now wow -> Apple oculus rp
[7:39:34] Indomitablez: They dont NEED to increase level cap. Just new content
[7:39:38] hashtagstronger: meh
[7:39:40] TornakSavage: thats dumb
[7:39:41] cory_lockman: dumb
[7:39:43] Cantbearyou11: could do a paragon style of leveling, and you just get a talent point or something with each one
[7:39:43] JayAnders: thats what i was just thinking
[7:39:46] strohmmy: bad take
[7:39:49] MrColvr: that's basically the same just more frequent
[7:39:53] SoSoBurrito: what if you are 55 when the xpac comes out guzuSADGE
[7:39:57] Kudamike: this is the way
[7:39:58] k0kicata: @radassbadass69 is it 255
[7:40:05] MalwareBaby: But then its all gear dependencies?
[7:40:09] LegendaryTwitchHero: Fuck levels
[7:40:09] strohmmy: thats what I want, no more leveling just more endgame
[7:40:10] cory_lockman: how do u solo old raids with no increased level?
[7:40:10] TornakSavage: yup levels dont have to exist once u hit the initial 60
[7:40:10] pademanu: guildwars 2 is like 2
[7:40:11] Mumblypeg: Just do a level squish once every 15 years lol
[7:40:13] kyrianmbape: who the fuck cares what the number says
[7:40:14] sapyokidz: just change Ilvl
[7:40:17] reindeering: the turtle wow experience
[7:40:23] klyforddofus: they could add omega levels, which allows u to level but its not over the cap, its just a extra nubmer
[7:40:25] klyforddofus: number
[7:40:26] drewboy29: dont all the options effectively do the same thing though
[7:40:27] ninjuhh_d4: Yes but they need a way to engage players and make a goal of getting stronger or a new level of power to farmntowards
[7:40:28] zin_panda: No new level cap with a msq attunement quest lines for raids
[7:40:28] klyforddofus: over ur normal elvel
[7:40:29] Elvandel: @Xaryu Or do something like Diablo and allow for different thresh holds be reached and the gear they can get are just slightly beetter. Wil keep the grind alive
[7:40:31] pademanu: guildwars 2 is like that
[7:40:34] liteseekerqt: what if you need to get experience to unlock the raids. kind of like questing and "leveling" to unlock the new raids @Xaryu
[7:40:34] Indomitablez: @Xaryu The thing I hate most about retail is the health pool and hitting for 20,000+. Why not bring it back down
[7:40:41] HelluvaWrecks: Have "leveling zones" be for getting 1 - 60, instead of forcing players through old expacs
[7:40:42] bateekh91: just increase 1 level
[7:40:44] Peppyfoil69420: if they do that leveling might be fun again in retail
[7:40:44] Indomitablez: exactly
[7:40:46] bateekh91: and make it long
[7:40:48] Roaming_Radiance: Decrease to 55 every expansion, only increase by 5
[7:40:48] andypandynz: you can do a stat squish and keep  increasing character levels
[7:40:53] ninjuhh_d4: Paragon system
[7:40:53] DBGmal: they add levels
[7:40:54] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: ff raises cap
[7:40:55] heygoditsme: other games die
[7:40:56] EbbandFlow_: They are at like 100 lol
[7:41:01] Playonwordz: paragon would work
[7:41:02] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: eso has infinite leveling
[7:41:02] cory_lockman: how u gonna solo an old raid???
[7:41:04] yalemontgomery: fax
[7:41:06] Pixiepantss: yeah seems like ppl rush to max lvl anyway
[7:41:06] ninjuhh_d4: They make paragon systems and world tiers
[7:41:08] aigilx: thats why they should just call it quits lol, too much bad content and too many levels
[7:41:10] waladinpaladin: I think that is what SoD will become no?
[7:41:13] yalemontgomery: Expansive world of warcraft
[7:41:18] Pixiepantss: oh thats a good idea
[7:41:20] emagill97: !addons
[7:41:20] StreamElements: Find Xaryu's addons & macros in discord -> discord.gg/xaryu in the #addons-macros channel
[7:41:20] Pixiepantss: ngl
[7:41:20] Cantbearyou11: paragon giving extra talent points would be sick
[7:41:22] Hellacat: replace leveling with rep
[7:41:24] ninjuhh_d4: World tiers
[7:41:26] cory_lockman: everyone hates paragon rep haha
[7:41:35] dersdog1: they want to add talents, expanding talents probably
[7:41:37] Banzeye95: imagine they actually tell a story through the quests rather than collecting random skins or books for no reason and you play through the story and gain rep etc
[7:41:39] jackpepsimba: turning wow into diablo has done enough damage already
[7:41:43] jackpepsimba: no more please lol
[7:41:44] scottyice2593: new wow game
[7:41:48] zin_panda: Maybe add in a runelike system? @xaryu
[7:41:52] andypandynz: @Banzeye95 barely anyone cares about that stuff
[7:41:54] MoastaJ: then what happens with low lvl characters
[7:41:55] Hakont: How are u still 40
[7:41:56] Playonwordz: wow needs a full reset with new terrain
[7:42:01] inglorious_pimp: bro 15 years ago people were leveling to 60 without addons for months, we didnt need new content that fast
[7:42:03] ninjuhh_d4: A cap stone dungeon or skill check to unlock the next harder world tier where mobs yield better drops and xp
[7:42:10] Magznr1: just got full set gear from gnomeregan and my character turns green lol, posted picture in discord if wanna see

[7:46:03] shloom995: Sod > classic
[7:46:08] Xenocide321: @hot_souffle it removes even more social aspect of the game
[7:46:11] AlmeOk: it should feel like that or blizz did a bad job with SoD

[7:49:31] updestiny: tbc was better imo
[7:49:34] slippinjimmmyy: MoP and Legion was the best wow imo
[7:49:35] Scoffered: Idk, no arena
[7:49:38] hashtagstronger: I haven't had this much fun since retail mop tbf
[7:49:41] taylorsdank: cata was best ill fight anyone

[7:49:51] spaceghostie47: TBC and WOTLK were best
[7:49:52] forever32: legion is hard to beat
[7:49:54] calamirlol: Sod has so much potential, and there is so much retail they can implement into sod
[7:49:55] PGsolutionAB: we all feel that fresh start
[7:49:58] badraztas: sod just needs arenas at 60
[7:50:01] latenightsuckmeright: @andypandynz you dont have a max lvl toon
[7:50:01] CJRecords420: Mop
[7:50:03] Scoffered: Best  WoW last 5-10 years lol
[7:50:04] taylorsdank: @forever32 i thought demon hunters were gonna change the game forever
[7:50:10] stevey221: could be if 60 raid is up to par with bwl or even naxx type difficulty then yeah.. big hopes for them taking it that far though
[7:50:14] Pixiepantss: mhm
[7:50:23] tbseason: imagine SoD Demon Hunters O.o
[7:50:24] PGsolutionAB: SoD is the best yet imo
[7:50:26] Espriest: and they aren't putting it all into beta either
[7:50:27] regularpers: thats a copium
[7:50:29] andypandynz: @latenightsuckmeright LUL what

[7:50:59] ExSpurtMEMES: new spells/abilities for classic era
[7:50:59] tbseason: @tbseason would never happen lol but if they do content after naxx (relatble to BC).... maybe??
[7:51:08] MikePickle: MikePickle subscribed with Prime. 
[7:51:13] LordKelris: i want tauren paladin in the game
[7:51:14] tbseason: @Pixiepantss y

[7:51:19] kronos4life4: hi, I'm only retail player but I wanted to ask, can warlocks really tank in SoD or not yet please ? Always wanted to try that
[7:51:26] heymatt: @kronos4life4 yes 100%
[7:51:31] hashtagstronger: @kronos4life4 they can
[7:51:38] vdubsz: is this faster than a regular group?
[7:51:47] kekolinoo: classic wow is just a game to log in for 2 weeks to satifiy your nostalgia and thats it
[7:51:49] bluntsamurai98: new gnomer boss that didnt exist
[7:51:52] hashtagstronger: @vdubsz a regular as in healer, tank and 3 random dps? yes
[7:51:56] carnnezz: devs put more effort into OG vanilla than all expansions combined
[7:51:57] Curtsy: @Pixiepantss It's never going to happen, DH's are about their mobility and you cannot put that kind of mobility into classic
[7:52:02] EXiTxi: Also we dont know how its going to end either.
[7:52:03] TurtleHoptv: @vdubsz way more faster

[7:52:12] SovereignAii: I played a lot during P1, but quit a lil while before P2, and haven't played P2 at all, and don't think I will either. I'm waiting for 60 cap.
[7:52:16] espi: @kronos4life4 warlocks in sod can tank with a rune, it gives them a tank form (think of it like bear form but for warlocks)
[7:52:18] DarkTakaEMS: You think when p3 releases, mages gonna Insta Go for Level 40 zul Farrak?
[7:52:19] gorglinz: big day tomorrow!!!
