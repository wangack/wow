[2:56:36] Moobot: https://www.twitch.tv/whaazz/clip/JazzyUnusualJalapenoEagleEye-idkWIYFZo54OaUnC
[2:56:39] Shinesx: how does trill do so much dam tho compared to every other rogue
[2:56:50] sapzrogue: To get better you have to look at what you did wrong. Pointing it out isn’t toxic. it’s just having an elite mentality
[2:56:51] mufaasa_fr: Pve
[2:57:01] aframpp: maybe you're a coach low key
[2:57:02] Atte0825: you did better kicks in late games against sam

[2:57:38] hydange: Some one post the trill pika copy pasta
[2:57:39] zaigodmodex: How did trill manage to do such high damage @whaazz

[2:57:42] sapzrogue: ban hammer
[2:57:42] provo2100: @shinesx Trills playstyle is full PvE, which fits his comp and meta. Watch other rogues, many of them do more setups and such
[2:57:44] thelightsoftheuniverse: Wait what?
[2:57:47] nuubkeike: Tru NA karen
[2:57:50] prikaze: lontar god x

[2:59:17] provo2100: More like 10% lol
[2:59:21] hydange: 8% growth every day is one hell of a drug
[2:59:23] windythemllf: Ofc you are, higher testo
[2:59:24] dskamin29: I’m the same person whether u win or lose too

[3:09:42] mrholydin: i honestly would say trill is better than whazz and im a big whazz fan. he just know how to do dmg really good in my opinion and really good at living so insane
[3:09:50] Xeratino18: its a healer gap
[3:10:02] PinkTaricFTW: I find it funny how M+ streamers can't talk while doing their keys. But here is Whaazz here, saying every thing that is happening as it's happening :D
[3:10:02] Jarkhi_94: if your so good on other classes why u do u play only rogue in tournament @Whaazz

[3:11:03] mrholydin: yeah but whazz was scared to mirror trill on rogue so what u guys mean?
[3:11:03] GIenQuagmire613: DING
[3:11:05] provo2100: @mrholydin Trill is a great player, but it's hard to do a straight up comparation, because they play in such different ways
[3:11:05] GIenQuagmire613: KEKW
[3:11:20] Croizlol: @provo2100 you can compare AWC wins 8v3 for whaazz ;P
[3:11:24] blinkers89: @PinkTaricFTW because theres nothing to talk about. its just pewpew mobs, know mechanics KEKW
[3:11:32] babannu: @mrholydin its called tactics
[3:11:49] windythemllf: You are dead bobydkS
[3:11:51] hongerlapp: anyone saying any rogue is better than whaazz hasnt seen how whaazz played RMP with mehh and raiku
[3:11:54] mrholydin: trill did a 2v3 vs 3 pro players.. cmon guys
[3:11:59] Knastapasta: @dadudadu happened to me too full glad lobby and im in green gear and first match on class that i played 2 hrs xD
[3:12:03] provo2100: @croizlol True
[3:12:19] Croizlol: @mrholydin i dont like when people say trill did 2v3 it was the end of the match the other team was pretty done it was a hardcore match
[3:12:51] provo2100: Did you see Lontar mana? Basicly he was grabbing popcorn watching his team dying, while he couldn't do anything
[3:12:59] nonestopqsx: beatifull claps
[3:13:01] nonestopqsx: :)
[3:13:21] nonestopqsx: ellers fking hårdt kørt respect
[3:13:22] nonestopqsx: :)
[3:13:24] Croizlol: the thing i admire the most about whaazz beside being the best rogue in the world is that he is also the best team player and team leader
[3:13:36] aframpp: should mmr reset every season?
