[2:01:24] Onlyhereforgiveaways: is this the diablo immortal waiting room? CoolStoryBob
[2:01:32] nahsti_rogue: Immolate, Conflagrate, Chaos Bolt is a very simple opener, than is just goes into Incinerate to build more Soul Shards than Conflagrate again to proc the talent to cast Chaos Bolt faster which in turn you cast Chaos Bolt and thats the core of throwing Chaos Bolts
[2:01:48] carlos9949: get hekili addon swifty, will put you what button to press in your screen

[2:03:46] userrx: should i do camping on every alt to get the belt  legendry ? ,,
[2:03:53] azzepted: use havoc on one target then focus another. always.
[2:04:00] nahsti_rogue: Yes, Immolate is your DoT. Havoc is your Sweeping Strikes but you need to select a Target
[2:04:14] bulimos: just keep immolate up, conflagarate to generate shards and reduce cast time on chaos bolt, and incinerate when conflagarate is down to generate shards for chaos bolt
[2:04:17] Belkael: give u a speed buff for incin or chaos bolt from conflagrate
[2:04:33] shyvegodx: why dont you go to icyveins and read up the guide? it's very easy to follow there

[2:05:38] ZethenZynx: i just get the addon hekili and don't have to know a rotation
[2:05:40] nahsti_rogue: You use Incinerate to build your Soul Shards, costs Soul Shards to throw Chaos Bolts

[2:20:23] Azuruk: congratulations on your marriage DAD SoonerLater
[2:20:33] Belkael: well i usuually immolate conflag then soulrot pop trink etc then summon infernal then spend Chaos bolts bc they summon more infernals that way or rain if fire if in aoe
[2:20:33] ragingtboner: if you open with catac it will apply immulate
[2:20:36] carlos9949: @Swifty ***
[2:20:43] nahsti_rogue: Immolate, Conflagrate, Chaos Bolt is a simple opener if you want. Keep Immolate up, use Incinerate to build soul shards, conflagrate when you're ready and than Chaos Bolt twice
[2:20:52] ragingtboner: for destro  it dont matter to drain life
[2:20:53] TheCosy: Thanks wicker. Im  running the lock now too, but kinda figuring out what is the best to do. Just switched to destro. Seems like the rotation is a little harder to get hold of
[2:20:55] StormwindCityGuard: There’s an addon called Spellflash for that swifty xD
[2:21:44] t3nacityy: @thecosy just practice and be ready to be focused In any pvp situation with stuns silences and spell locks

[2:22:56] gooni_coyg: when u conflagrete the next 2 abilities cast faster.. Look at your talents
[2:22:57] nahsti_rogue: @swifty Conflagrate reduces the cast time of your next two Incarnates or Chaos Bolts after you use it, so in your rotation when you have enough soul shards, Conflag and wam bam thank you miam
[2:22:59] ragingtboner: haste maste

[2:23:58] ragingtboner: go use soul rot on the aoe dummies to you left
[2:23:59] leszek7: don't get baited into draining life after soul rot, it's rarely worth it
[2:24:02] instructOS: soul rot will affect multiple targets, and then your drain life will hit them all too
[2:24:03] ragingtboner: then drain life
[2:24:07] t3nacityy: that's what I run with
[2:24:10] Belkael: u need to use soul rot and summon infernal before u  start throwing chaos bolts imo
[2:24:44] Belkael: bc the shards u spend will give u more chances at extra infernals and it has some soul shard regen
[2:24:48] ragingtboner: use soul rot on aoe dummies to your left then soul rot to see affect

[3:21:00] noxxysucks: @Swifty havoc let's you do chaos bolts on like 3 targets
[3:21:04] dillpicklejoe: BG's?
[3:21:05] noxxysucks: lets*
[3:21:08] heluimalex: @Swifty u put havoc on a secondary target and it'll automaticly send bolts on that offtarget u put havoc on
[3:21:16] PapaBeks: i think what he is saying is, they have to be standing in the bane for it to hit them, if targets run out of bane it wont hit them
[3:21:16] rbubbaray: ohh yeah havoc
