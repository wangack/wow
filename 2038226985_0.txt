[0:17:42] CLAMChowdair: Steam or game pass?
[0:17:52] raginbuckeye: @Sollice Say that a little louder for the people in Syracuse
[0:18:01] RocketTanks: Steam gamepass doesnt have server support.
[0:18:06] BVRlive: @Sollice nah, discord was coming through
[0:18:18] Sollice: Yeah I know right. He goes to Syracuse? real competitive
[0:18:35] CLAMChowdair: Actually, you run the server on a pc and then just play the game. Like minecraft
[0:18:54] Sollice: This is a hosted server not local I believe
[0:19:07] Molvonos: Yep, its hosted
[0:19:08] CLAMChowdair: Cool.
[0:19:30] CLAMChowdair: Someone paid for hosting? Lol smh
[0:19:49] Molvonos: lol
[0:19:51] Molvonos: No.
[0:20:21] Sollice: @raginbuckeye I think OSU making the right choices. Hiring Bill O'Brien has their OC and it looks like they may have a 5 star recruit for QB. I don't know their current depth
[0:20:37] Sollice: Why would it be a big deal to pay for a hosted server?
[0:20:55] tr4ncetv: If you think BOB is a good hire, I have a beach house in Idaho to sell ya Kappa
