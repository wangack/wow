[0:19:24] BWILDPOKER: @Hydramist Think tailoring is required as a caster in p2? pvp and pve
[0:20:13] downs504: Hydra what class you think will be more fun at 60? Druid or priest?
[0:20:16] BWILDPOKER: Whats good for tailoring in pvp
[0:20:42] Hydramist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvcBhJCtj0
[0:20:43] Hydramist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvcBhJCtj0
[0:20:43] Kataemoi: Hydra, the best PvP spec for warr right now is Prot. Devastate rune is now 100% weapon dmg and stacks at +10% more dmg per stack. You lower their armor by 1k or more. Then you will get shield slam, etc. And more runes that increase dmg. What do you think? Worth giving up MS in Arms?
[0:20:58] Gallowxyz: @BWILDPOKER Boots have 30% damage reductions CD
[0:21:48] ephixa_fan: hydraLeigh
[0:22:03] Kataemoi: MS doesn't increase dmg, only reduces healing as far as I know
[0:22:19] ephixa_fan: slept all day man my sunday is fked
[0:23:24] Kataemoi: yes, i think you're hinting at not being able to heal as much = more dmg that you receive

[0:24:19] rns_aurelius: even if the raid dps was 80 with ms it would be more effective than 100 dps without
[0:25:50] ama__deus: Tried to 1v1 a hunter today with no LOS opportunity. Just got destroyed
[0:25:55] Gallowxyz: Chilling in ashenvale with my homies and PS turns up and ruins my afternoon
[0:26:07] mrbirman: i mean i get it with the boomie being so fun and op but man priest is a god at the moment :D
[0:26:25] ama__deus: pet resisted fear, got wingclipped and pumped into Sadge
[0:26:42] JustOndore: How is it going @Hydramist
[0:27:04] ScarletteRobin: Do you think taking imp mana burn is worth it with all the new runes? feels harder to get them off with like homunculis on you and with runes feeling bursty.

[0:27:36] ScarletteRobin: Thanks,  that was my thought too
[0:28:03] Kataemoi: I think if there's another tournament in the future u can win it this time Hydra, because warlocks will no longer be able to outperform priests with the runes now
[0:28:05] ScarletteRobin: ScarletteRobin subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:28:23] Amerish88: Will the queues return on Living flame with P2 release, or did they fix all that crap with the lock
[0:29:11] bassiemon123: Ooohh u got hello fresh sponsor. Used it for a while, really liked it.

[0:30:29] bassiemon123: Aaahh nice
[0:31:04] fakemejo: oo sounds fun :D
[0:31:29] Kataemoi: that sounds like a lot of fun
[0:31:44] Sinostra: Ok but you need to allow alliance players to participate
[0:31:54] bassiemon123: That sounds fun

[0:33:01] saund: are you worried about STV event snipers at all as a streamer?
[0:33:03] Sinostra: You need to find an empty spot
[0:33:06] saund: from same faction too
[0:33:09] Sinostra: For duels
[0:33:29] prodigy_wow: Good Morning lad
[0:33:34] misstherese: hello
[0:33:41] Blgdiesel: whats the risk of snipers in stv? Doesnt event just give currency for kills
[0:33:52] Sinostra: It's better if alliance can duel horde
[0:34:15] prodigy_wow: Would be cool if even in pvp server, we had one zone where everyone is friendly
[0:34:15] Sinostra: Like i wanna duel Msr and Vrs
[0:34:36] Sinostra: We can try to find some remote place
[0:34:59] bassiemon123: What about wargames?
[0:35:52] prodigy_wow: Prodigy________________ watched 10 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! wow look how cool i am
[0:36:35] Sinostra: Can't we keep the layer hidden ?

[0:36:55] zyoss123: how many and what classes u got in 25 hydra?
[0:37:08] prodigy_wow: You doubt the extent the griefers will go
[0:37:53] mopchild: you tried out the wildgrowth version ?

[0:42:16] b_bxl: There is an addon that says their class only but I don't know it's name so a bit of pointless info
[0:42:21] Sinostra: how do you manage groups/raids ?
[0:42:22] DnB_Junkee: Oh I see, you just want all names hidden
[0:42:44] b_bxl: It just says Mage, on their target frame and above their char
[0:42:58] Kataemoi: What is the purpose of hiding names? stream snipers they will just see where you are in STV
[0:43:02] DnB_Junkee: for nameplates and any frames that is easy
[0:43:09] Kataemoi: by watching the stream
[0:43:11] mopchild: @Kataemoi not if you're on a different layer
[0:43:12] saund: at least you are a good pvper and can defend yourself, people like Jokerd and Guzu will have a really bad time next phase 100% @Hydramist
[0:43:13] luzid7: its leatrix plus
[0:43:18] saund: LuL
[0:43:27] luzid7: frames
[0:43:34] mopchild: essentially to simplify this all what you want is a health/ mana bar and no names
[0:43:39] luzid7: class colered frames
[0:43:41] mopchild: might be easier to do than changing player names to class names
[0:43:45] luzid7: ye

[0:47:43] Kataemoi: hydra what is the trick to becoming rlly good at pvp? how did u learn ur priest. I'm still a clicker i could never get used to key binds
[0:47:48] bodkinz_: /run TargetFrameTextureFrameName:Hide()
[0:47:48] sending123: is this tier list assuming we get all the runes they showed? i think they gonna just implement belt and boots
[0:47:50] redlivinglegend: you want to hide enemy names?
[0:47:51] bodkinz_: this one removed target name
[0:47:59] jordimestree: HawnkTv have  exactly whar are u asking for
[0:48:01] Volitar: it makes me sad to see you playing boomkin
[0:48:08] b_bxl: Try the Hide Realm Name Addon - it has an option to hide player name. Haven't tried it myself though @Hydramist
[0:48:17] Sinostra: how about
[0:48:20] Sinostra: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/hide-realm-names

[0:56:17] varatupaj: you can hide tooltip behind the add, its kinda hidden for us right now :D
[0:56:33] Gallowxyz: Might be a long shot but maybe worth a look at the Move Anything addon? That usually lets you adjust / hide default UI elements
[0:57:16] mopchild: you could move over the hellofresh add a little to the left and it will cover the name
[0:57:33] DnB_Junkee: so what I am thinking of is maybe change the font of the names to something unreadable
[0:57:55] DnB_Junkee: trying to find how to change names
[0:58:10] mopchild: hide name and just show guild ???
[0:58:16] mopchild: as 99% of people are in a guild
[0:58:17] DnB_Junkee: @mopchild not possible

[1:04:23] optik_rec0rds: yes
[1:04:39] DnB_Junkee: I am afraid to tell you, that currently the only option I found is changing the font, but that leads to other shit then being unreadable as well...
[1:04:41] ama__deus: @Hydramist awesome job on the guide! The only thing missing for me is a sort of guideline on dispel. It's so easy to oom yourself as a noob priest on dispelling anything and everything from you or your team/enemy team Sadge
[1:05:15] mopchild: yeah wildgrowth is a massive game changer
[1:05:24] ama__deus: That'd be cool SeemsGood
[1:05:26] mopchild: same mana as regrowth but heals like 28902377892 more
[1:05:45] optik_rec0rds: dispell just comes with experience

[2:27:43] MVPeteTV: caster weapons are kinda lacking, feel like meele get 50 options while we all want 1 or 2
[2:27:50] saund: @Prodigy________________ same with medicine pouch if it works at 40
[2:28:19] psykfall69: @MVPeteTV its the same for melee, no one wants the weapons with shitty speed and stats
[2:28:32] psykfall69: @ama__deus none of the above
[2:28:44] infuze27: that staff clearly goes to only NE priest for starsharts Pog
[2:28:52] prodigy_wow: hah
[2:28:55] ama__deus: @psykfall69 pbtvSUS either way, you're probably still aware that the vast vast majority of players doesn't run around with 1200g.
[2:29:02] infuze27: LUL
[2:29:33] Bolveg: Should be easy
[2:29:56] psykfall69: @ama__deus yeah probably not, but im not a farmer or TSM expert so anyone should be able to get some gold before p2 hits
[2:30:01] Bolveg: I get it on beta hc as 30lvl priest
[2:30:45] hiraethonhs: @psykfall69 most ppl dont play wow to farm gold
[2:30:55] ama__deus: @psykfall69 if I had 1g every time a gold buyer told me they are just flipping stuff on the AH, I'd have 1200g as well Kappa
[2:30:55] Victwitch: 'source questname' links straight to wowhead so you can easily check if gettable or not really :)

[6:51:09] hiraethonhs: if they know ur location
[6:51:18] corradoe: pretty sure he returned back to original layer, probably was locked. no way ppl can find him that fast otherwise
[6:51:18] Sinostra: they don't need that much people tbh, one on each layer
[6:51:20] EliteMinj: Maybe there's a spy in connect
[6:51:34] Sinostra: there's usally 6 to 10 active layers at a time
[6:51:37] jezzi23: I added a spell viewer thingy where you can type spell IDs or sometimes names like "Mind Spike"
[6:51:53] EliteMinj: I heard seal team six has some secret layer swapping add-on, makes sense
[6:51:55] Sinostra: imo they brute force it

[7:02:11] Itrulia: also allows you to have deadly brew as dagger rogue
[7:02:15] walkingwaste1: do you think since mindspike deals shadow frost damage we can take advantage of frost mages winter chill? or is it a self buff for mages? also what about frost spell power potions could that help with added damage?
