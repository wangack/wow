[1:44:46] headgrumble: Thank you, because I've always been healing since wotlk, and I never experienced that
[1:45:04] fridche: Yo Ziqo, idk how familiar you are with this but my friends said you could stretch gnomes to become regular humans back in the day, is that true?

[1:47:57] Spliffaroony: bunch of mobs in gy at least
[1:48:07] Quaztopher: GY seemed insane actually
[1:48:18] hobbehesu: bosses give allot more xp than usual, regular mobs give a reduced amount (but you get party bonus xp)
[1:48:19] charactersthatwilldie: it’s a lot higher than that when your level is closer to the grp average.
[1:48:31] Quaztopher: oh arcane blast + living flame is just insane too
[1:48:40] charactersthatwilldie: you can’t solo lib at 31

[1:51:16] Quaztopher: my girlfriend is asking me if we should do pizza or ramen for dinner tonight, thoughts?
[1:51:23] DecayedRA: how is everyone in the lair doing today?
[1:51:26] charactersthatwilldie: was replying to quaz - he’s missing some understanding grp xp mechanics. You get a lot more than 175xp per elite mob in a grp where you are closer to the average group members’ levels. its closer to 300xp per elite in lib when you’re the correct lvl
[1:51:31] Captain_Hindsightx: @Quaztopher homemade or ordering?
[1:51:35] IcE002: pizza and ramen bro

[1:52:40] strange_lives: nah
[1:52:58] Captain_Hindsightx: i'd go pizza then @Quaztopher
[1:53:01] Quaztopher: We usually do a pesto sauce pizza, with chicken, ricotta and sliced tomoates on our pizza
[1:53:03] Dissasster: google shows only ally ragent vendor in arathi
[1:53:07] hobbehesu: and soup
[1:53:16] erlend94: I have in game fomo and irl atm
[1:53:21] Onko22: wifon

[1:53:43] Quaztopher: @BeCarefulitsSoup 100%
[1:53:44] xxxeatdirtxxx: literally noodles,water and seasoning
[1:53:44] HAUSFRAUtrusse: dont compare instant noodles to ramen KEKZ
[1:53:59] zathorius: thats like microwave pizza
[1:53:59] Qrucials: that's like saying a slice of bread and some ketchup is pizza
[1:54:08] zuries: mcdonalds coffe is great
[1:54:13] VoodouChile: wutt
[1:54:15] VoodouChile: no way
