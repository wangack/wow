[0:33:15] TrueVista: @shroud solar subclass is all about burning enemies. Some solar weapons have a perk called Incandescent, that perk explodes enemies when getting precision kills with the weapon. That explosion applies an effect called burning to other enemies around which chains with some of your abilities if used properly
[0:33:16] IlHavoc: I‚Äôve done two characters on legend and idk if I can muster up the energy to do my last one

[1:11:26] DACH33ZMAN: @werderman197 they rebuilt it so they could do quicker updates and do them more frequently. IDT i can post links in chat but theres many TWABs that talked about it a few years ago
[1:11:28] Warmanreaper: @imaginashunz I paid 390ish collectively for both of mine, and one of them is 2k and  has HDR
[1:11:31] Majorgromp: He's immune to DOT gotta remove shoulderpads KEKW
[1:11:34] Sweaty_Crease: You have to break his spirit by whispering insults into the mic

[1:11:56] eodimiz1nn: get a linear fsion rifle
[1:11:58] ABentChurrro: @shroud jolt with chain reaction would help. If you create ords, explosive light does more with boss spec
[1:12:01] Craigito: Isnt that the wave frame nade launcher?
[1:12:01] Tehu_Tehu: @DeathsLastRequestz its not about the components themselves its about the games, PC games are not going to get the same treatment tech wise as ps5 exclusives
[1:12:02] default_guy77: @psynytes Aware it never ends
[1:12:03] Andrew19east: if shroud is liking the void bow he should consider switching to void subclass, devour is rlly good for survivability

[1:12:38] blxcklock: Need a linear fusion
[1:12:39] EastwoodIT: Tormentors have damage resistance
[1:12:41] xLocus: grenade launchers are aoe
[1:12:41] viddyagames: use machine gun
[1:12:43] SmoothRNG: get a taipan 4fr
[1:12:43] M4ROONE: nah dell s2722dgm got it on a sale tho
[1:12:44] Transation: You need witherhoard asap
[1:12:44] Azzassiin: Use izagnagi
[1:12:48] Mortr3x: cuz you need to hit the yelow parts on the enemy
[1:12:48] Discipline_OR_Regret: @Tehu_Tehu I understand that but even the sony exclusives that have since released on PC run better than PS5 mate, you can get way more FPS at native 4K
[1:12:49] adipopa04: ONLY HEAD
[1:12:49] Cooploop07: he only takes precision damage mainly
[1:12:49] Blintike: Its because its kina explosive AoE
[1:12:49] schnellbuilding: use precision type weapon
[1:12:49] default_guy77: @psynytes elisSmile
[1:12:49] ABentChurrro: don't use LF, nerfed
[1:12:50] wafflesondmt: @shroud its easier to use crit weapons on him like izanagi
[1:12:51] EastwoodIT: Explosive resistance*
[1:12:52] maajsz: linear fusion to hit precision on him
[1:12:52] WoIIah: I think precision weapons are better for tormentors
[1:12:53] inquiziti: precision weapons that can crit are better
[1:12:53] cntra__: the type is bad
[1:12:53] djsmithy9: Thats stasis damage
[1:12:54] Guenhyvar_: @imaginashunz 60 fps is low tho?
[1:12:54] calebfizzy: ues izi
[1:12:55] DOCTORSNOB: you want precision weapons to hit the yellow spots on them
[1:12:55] ogF8L: g launchers always have sucked
[1:12:55] kalvonje: @imaginashunz it really is though.. im sorry but 60 is super outdated for a pc
[1:12:55] Dende_meier: machine gun if you have sir
[1:12:57] Cooploop07: EXPLOSIVES CANT DO PRECISION DAMAGE
[1:12:58] hausee: have he learnd the bow yet? :D
[1:12:58] Shade_Fin: Tormentors don't really take any other than precision damage @shroud
[1:12:59] spartoned: use machine gun
[1:12:59] maruhhh: you need to hit the crit on his chest
[1:13:00] djsmithy9: Ark is light blue
[1:13:01] blxcklock: Machine gun, linear fusion, heavy sniper would be ideal
[1:13:02] schnellbuilding: inzanagis maybe good
[1:13:04] Blintike: I think precision weapons are effective against him
[1:13:05] Jkist7: @GhostTownParty Bungie has a LFG system that is easy to use, google Bungie Fireteam LFG
[1:13:05] itzzdutch: You have to shoot his shoulder pads with precision
[1:13:08] Kn0wLeDgEsEeKeR: he is a crit boss so a linear or sniper
[1:13:09] frost1407: use the kinetic autorifle @shroud
[1:13:11] StreamElements: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[1:13:15] Blintike: No
[1:13:15] h0pefulv3teran: Tormentors are my bane this season so far
[1:13:15] inquiziti: no
[1:13:16] TKSilent: not precision
[1:13:16] IlHavoc: It‚Äôs a wave frame gl it‚Äôs for add clear
[1:13:16] blxcklock: If you hit the crib yes
[1:13:17] calebfizzy: yea better then GL's
[1:13:18] shoo_val: explosives cant crit
[1:13:18] EastwoodIT: Still explosive damage
[1:13:18] schnellbuilding: no
[1:13:18] ZoruPurz: what is legendary ? i havent played destiny 2 in years so idk whats going on
[1:13:20] Cooploop07: no
[1:13:20] TangTecumseh: You need to blind or freeze him and then you get space to dps
[1:13:21] DOCTORSNOB: Machine guns are really good against them
[1:13:21] Nivrik: kinda
[1:13:23] eodimiz1nn: rl better than gl
[1:13:24] shoo_val: unl u have mods
[1:13:29] Baglio: @imaginashunz 60fps is the bare minimum something should be running nowadays
[1:13:32] default_guy77: @zorupurz hardest difficulty?
[1:13:39] Blintike: Blinding GL are good against them
[1:13:39] mrdreamin0: @ghosttownparty u can find lfg on Xbox, or if ur on pc or ps u can download the destiny app and use the lfg in there.
[1:13:42] o_kayden: machine gun will probabyl be best for heavy weapon
[1:13:47] ZoruPurz: @default_guy77 ah ok ty
[1:13:51] DACH33ZMAN: I blew him up with fusion nade spam using starfire protocol lol
[1:13:52] Shade_Fin: No, the only heavy weapon archetype that can deal precision damage is Linear Fusion Rifles
[1:13:53] imaginashunz: modern day games like hogwarts and dead space remake can barely reach 60fps even with rtx cards
[1:13:57] default_guy77: @zorupurz iitzNODDERS
[1:13:59] AnarchyN7: Rockets still work
[1:14:01] ZoruPurz: how come everyone is at 1600 light tho wtf
[1:14:03] ogF8L: just buy the ghallhorn dlc best rpg in game
[1:14:08] PeekabooSiuuuu: Use super when needed
[1:14:14] juliotulho: @shroud after breaking his armor (shoulder pads) you can do damage to his entire body
[1:14:16] Lemniscate144: @Shade_Fin there are heavy snipers
[1:14:17] Evicous: what's his main class?
[1:14:18] Tehu_Tehu: @DeathsLastRequestz FPS yes i agree but tech like directstorage on PC wont be a thing for a while, while every ps5 exclusive is going to get it
[1:14:19] fishman176: @imaginashunz hogwarts was made on a toaster
[1:14:21] Baglio: @imaginashunz HUH i run hogwarts at 90-150 and I have a 2070super
[1:14:25] ItsmeAcademy: @ZoruPurz It's a harder version of the campaign missions. Basically you are put 15, 20 below recommended level. Doing this gives you more rewards.
[1:14:28] kuurookuu: Chat you still dint teach him to hold E while in character menu
[1:14:30] liandas: does item level affect in legendery mode? Isn't it recude on legendery?
[1:14:30] default_guy77: @imaginashunz well, lirik could play dead space remake in 120 fps, almost
[1:14:33] Hamstyy: @ZoruPurz The new high is like 1800
[1:14:34] TKSilent: ya
[1:14:44] mrdreamin0: @zorupurz due too the expansion it‚Äôs now up too 1600 everything
[1:14:45] aliaytmr: !apexsens

[1:14:45] Guenhyvar_: @imaginashunz i was on a 1080 and with fsr2 got over 100 fps
[1:14:48] default_guy77: @imaginashunz still, both games were good tho
[1:14:50] AnarchyN7: The hit reg for heavy GL's are off this season
[1:14:57] imaginashunz: @baglio  so do I. I'm playing on 144hz
[1:15:03] zer0cypher: if you have a machine gun, they do good single target boss damage
[1:15:05] default_guy77: @guenhyvar_ lirikPOG
[1:15:13] imaginashunz: @guenhyvar_ that's not 1440p
[1:15:13] Evicous: I legit was confused why hogwarts was playing like trash but it's just the game and not my PC
[1:15:18] x_vyn_: @imaginashunz COPIUM
[1:15:24] Tehu_Tehu: @DeathsLastRequestz also , Demon's Souls Remake was by far the best looking game i've played even 3 years later nothing competes with it graphically
[1:15:26] PONPOKO_C: i have been influenced by mr shroud influencer to download this game
[1:15:30] Blackbeard: Didn't know le monarch did work like this in legendary tbh.
[1:15:33] Baglio: @imaginashunz @imaginashunz then how are you saying its hard for RTX to reach 60? I'm also on 1440p 144 at that framerate
[1:15:41] ZoruPurz: damn ty for clear up guys, i seen the traveller move and im an OG d1 player and seeing it all happening now give me huge flash backs its crazy, wish i got into D2 :(

[1:16:02] DWG_Grahf: @StatvarQS  lol u ok bud?
[1:16:07] Shade_Fin: @Lemniscate144 Only exotic, There's also an exotic bow but there's no point in explaining that kind of stuff when he's new to the game. Linears are the only non exotic heavys that can hit precisions
[1:16:09] captainogs: hold e when looking at gear chief

[1:16:21] Discipline_OR_Regret: @Tehu_Tehu Direct Storage is already a thing on PC using NVME drives and again, I disagree on DS looking the best, best game visuals I have seen on console for me was Spiderman Remastered
[1:16:24] lxzurite: shoot shoulder with sniper

[1:19:38] Beastyrecruit: yep
[1:19:39] Discipline_OR_Regret: @Tehu_Tehu I get that, I'm on about again, people that do, I'm comparing a 500 dollar console to a gaming PC that one component alone can cost 3 to 4x more than a console - For example, you can pay upwards of 2K dollars for a gpu
[1:19:39] wafflesondmt: check the postmaster in dim as well
[1:19:39] sigsegvs: Yeah but dont vault stuff right now. Only once you hit power cap.
[1:19:40] Gord_the_Rogue: yes

[1:19:45] DireZenith: Destiny item manager
[1:19:46] Medezio0o: the vault
[1:19:47] imaginashunz: @baglio rtx 2070 super and ryzen 9 are not 6 years old though? I see your point but some developers still seem just to prioritize 60fps console gaming then just port it to pc. That's why I think dead space remake and hogwarts run so bad
[1:19:47] tempest671: You'll be getting way better gear after soft cap eventually
[1:19:47] kuurookuu: Hold E in charcater menu
[1:19:48] Gremmel: Just make sure you have all max power gear on the character @shroud
[1:19:48] MrMarkius: not from postmaster right?
[1:19:54] Bhu1234: You want the DIM App, it's faster
[1:19:58] Medezio0o: the VAULT on browser
[1:19:58] Jkmk1: you can shift tab dim as well
[1:19:59] DACH33ZMAN: Make sure you keep your highest power level guns on your character
[1:20:01] SWHAF_: blues are really only good for light level consumption.

[1:20:12] default_guy77: @dog1esss shroudWave

[1:20:13] Baglio: @imaginashunz yeah that could be a fair take for sure
[1:20:14] Discipline_OR_Regret: @Tehu_Tehu A console is never, ever gonna compete with a high end PC running top of the line components, never gonna happen

[1:20:31] Lemniscate144: empty vault. what a beautiful sight

[1:21:43] itscrespo: glimmer you do need to collect
[1:21:45] StatvarQS: Didnt use to be like that, im glad its better
[1:21:46] TangTecumseh: Only for glimmer do you need to run
[1:21:46] d2anubis: @TKSilent That is incorrect. Changed a long time ago
[1:21:46] errljonesiii: gotta pick it up
[1:21:46] funnormalguy: Need to touch glimmer
[1:21:49] JasxnP: @FilthyFloridaMan it 100% does
[1:21:50] IAmRogueNine: glimmer does not go to postmaster, you have to run over it
[1:21:50] kuurookuu: @shroud hold E on chracter menu
[1:21:52] parappa_zg: wall opposite of the gate

[1:21:55] default_guy77: @boat_4 he is enjoying this
[1:21:58] repliccaa: i dont think it checks your vault
[1:22:00] IdealDeno: i doenst check the vault guys.
[1:22:00] blxcklock: Everything gives glimmer you‚Äôre fine
[1:22:00] fenix_1201: glimmer you have to run over  engrams will go to postmaster
[1:22:01] IAmRogueNine: dont worry too much about it, you'll get plenty of glimmer just by doing things
[1:22:01] DACH33ZMAN: i promise you youll make more then you ever lose
[1:22:03] ApexMetroo: you dont need to run over it @shroud
[1:22:04] frinntintin: You'll get more passively. I wouldn't worry too much
[1:22:06] guvais: its capped at 250k ur good
[1:22:07] TrueVista: dont worry about it too much, glimmer is stupid easy to get
[1:22:08] Smityyy: there is a cap
[1:22:09] NoobSniperr: Glimmer is not a worry. You can exchange a common mat you have for 10,000 glimmer at a time in the Tower.
[1:22:09] TURP2212: turn rainmaker on
[1:22:11] schnellbuilding: glimmer is not very scarce don't worry

[1:22:39] MKH2K9: @MarkerGG No you don't.
[1:22:39] PsyNytes: No @blasphemyfps
[1:22:39] UnleashTheGinger: Most glimmer is obtained passively while playing, you miss out on just a little by not running over it
[1:22:39] PlumSauceTV: Is shroud gonna be a trials gamer?
[1:22:40] default_guy77: @blasphemyfps no
[1:22:41] my9plays: Bow is also generally not very good in PVE. I'd recommend a grenade launcher, submachine gun, and like a rocket launcher
[1:22:42] kalvonje: @MarkerGG shroud def keeps it on him
[1:22:46] schnellbuilding: destroyed
[1:22:48] Worldyo: thats a hit on LAN

[1:22:54] blasphemyfps: Cool thanx chat
[1:22:55] TrueVista: there is an exotic that gives you a second one and makes it deal more damage
[1:22:55] Shade_Fin: Chat please.... Bungie has said multiple times in Twabs already that as long as you've gotten an item with a certain power level the game will remember that forever. You can dismantle everything or do whatever with the items, the game will know how high power you have already gotten.
[1:22:55] boredkeyboard: @MarkerGG just look it up bro
[1:22:55] spooky_dookie69420: @default_guy77 seems like he is the only one LULW

[1:36:24] siggiboyy: @spoopityy he will constantly get higher gear under soft cap, and since he is relatively new he has no need to infuse, better to just equip what he gets throughout

[2:00:34] Mortr3x: @shroud press on the name of the weapon on DIM and light gg

[2:00:36] Capt_Plushie: origin traits just mean they're new or reworked, old weapons are still good with the right roll
[2:00:36] causingcarnage: theyre called origin perks, every gun from a manufacterer has a perk built into every gun
[2:00:36] caylenfoxboi: That is VERY good due to auto loading @shroud
[2:00:36] kopejka: palmyra good
[2:00:36] Cheesy_Jesus_: Lol
[2:00:37] okmitty: Fifth is just a bonus based on the ‚Äúfoundry that made the gun‚Äù
[2:00:38] tacomaahaja: 4 perks is fine ther still good
[2:00:38] NikSWBF: Origin traits are the extra perk,they aren't random like funnelweb will always have viest @shroud
[2:00:40] Willshaper_: if you click on the gun you will get a full description

[2:01:00] Kn0wLeDgEsEeKeR: someone run this man through VOG for some weapons please
[2:01:02] chris6x6x6: Certain weapons have origin traits which are a perk that exclusive to a certain weapon foundry or activity it comes from. Some weapons are just basic world drops so no origin trait @shroud

[2:02:09] TheMotivation: @twobyfor Yeah, everyone just has all mods now, aside from Raid mods
[2:02:09] sogakii: Light gg is really good at figuring out that type of stuff cause people also have the ability to leave reviews on how the gun feels and how their roll worked for them. you can also look at all the rolls on the weapon it can get.
[2:02:09] okmitty: @bosshogg10 your opinion isn‚Äôt great  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
