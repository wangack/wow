[4:21:04] NotASkiller: criminals are crafty
[4:21:12] grizz430: bro they don't pay full price and they charge back, Blizzard loses money on bot subs. This arguement was settled a long time ago.
[4:21:24] neon_wow: It isn't settled becuase they still allow it
[4:21:24] Neriakied: yeah blizz doesnt make as much money off this as that dude thinks
[4:21:39] Neriakied: the guys running 100+ botfarms arent buying $15 subs with their bank account lol
[4:21:58] themanjake2020: That is why we dont have customer support anymore @Bean .. Remember calling them and on hold you would listen to scholozar basin music.
[4:22:06] dooks98: @Bean do you know what paczki's are?
[4:22:16] neon_wow: You can't allow thousands and thousands of bots fly hacking for years on end without hiring human GM and say " Oh we lose money on bots " No company would do that.
[4:22:17] grizz430: @neon_wow theyr not allowing it because theyre making money off of it, theyre allowing beccause theyre inept and cheap
[4:22:19] Neriakied: if u guys think botting is bad in wow u should look into fps games where its way worse
[4:22:41] neon_wow: @grizz430 If they were losing money they would hire human GM. Simple business.
