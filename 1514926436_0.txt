[1:28:37] brother_jays: Got that classic title so, leveled :)
[1:28:49] MangoOverthere: I'm honestly surprised prot is viable in current pvp 🤣 I wouldn't even try and my mains prot as well
[1:28:52] Stalefos: watched payo get ganked by a prot the other day on wrath, it was ridiculous
[1:28:53] Kohvos: @Jmoney138 look at his character title

[1:29:38] berousing: you can exchange them for honor
[1:29:40] inkognito3006: no
[1:29:40] SaintlyDevotion: Hey Swifty =) Ever wanted to make an old-school montage again? I remember staying up during school lans watchings your montages while playing vanilla haha
[1:29:41] MangoOverthere: Pretty sure they did that in Cata. don't quote me
[1:29:42] aeveritt84: If you do the dailies you can get 2-3k honor a day just from that
[1:29:42] Adaminko69: you will be able to redeem them for honor
[1:29:44] Diipindots: when are we expecting wolk?
[1:29:44] darqxxd: they dont
[1:30:06] Ruxthas: hold them
[1:30:09] aeveritt84: I think you won't be earning anymore, but you can still redeem them if you have them
[1:30:09] BigG_18: you can turn them in for horor i wotlk
[1:30:21] lenestusss: Is it true that we can’t transfer tbc toons to wrath till 90days after wrath come out? @swifty
[1:30:29] Scolex2013: we have done this before. how do we forget things like this.
[1:30:36] Scolex2013: it's classic
[1:30:52] realchocos: i have a question we will be able to keep the honor that we have farmed in tbc for wotlk.?? or they will reset?
[1:30:52] patison111: preety sure they will reset marks and honor before wotlk
[1:31:12] MangoOverthere: @lenestusss nah I'm pretty sure you can't boost on fresh servers for 90 days. doubt they'd do that.
[1:31:15] realchocos: thx @patison111
[1:31:16] lenestusss: Is it true that we can’t transfer tbc toons to wrath till 90days after wrath come out? swifty

[1:31:19] berousing: they wont
[1:31:40] jox_fox: thats for the fresh servers
[1:31:43] niburu__: thats only on the fresh servers
[1:31:43] Accountless_2012_to_2022: @lenestusss only to the fresh WotLK server
[1:31:44] aeveritt84: for fresh servers I think
[1:31:52] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store

[1:31:57] chin184: hey swifty! When is pre patch
[1:32:06] SaintlyDevotion: Hey @Swifty =) Ever wanted to make an old-school montage again? I remember staying up during school lans watchings your montages while playing vanilla haha
[1:32:16] berousing: berousing subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! zugzug
[1:32:19] StreamElements: berousing just subscribed for 2 months in a row PogChamp
[1:32:30] clarkson_94: what server are you on
[1:32:44] MangoOverthere: I mean the start of the expac is essentially fresh anyways, no? Just won't have a ton of people starting at lvl 1
[1:32:53] blade96tv: i dont think prepatch is even in 1 month
[1:32:53] FlynnFluff: whats coming with the prepatch?
[1:33:25] berousing: graphic card price is crashing
[1:33:28] bsbmb: Why prep, if someone doesn’t prep will be that much behind and hinder the experience?
[1:33:34] FlynnFluff: is the 70 boost coming with it?
[1:33:35] DenghisKhann: Prepatch wont be for at least 7 weeks I think. The blue post says the XP buff arriving in "the coming weeks", and will last 6-8 weeks, leading up to pre-patch
[1:33:37] aeveritt84: I hope it's atleast a month before prepatch
[1:33:41] FlynnFluff: and how many can we get?

[1:37:20] rainraira: I haven't played WoW in years. Watching you now & then more than sates any WoW desires. Thanks Man! Much appreciated.

[1:38:08] rainraira: I've watched now & then for a long time.
[1:38:28] DenghisKhann: @tiowira What server are you on? If you are on one of the 3 living servers you should be fine. I just level 2 characters 60-70 recently and didnt have an issue with dungeon groups. I recommend the 'LFG Bulletin Board' add-on to help organize LFG chat and find group more easily
[1:38:28] AddictedToZugs: prot does no dmg sadly
[1:38:40] costa_living: Swifty what’s the diet and gym looking like?
[1:38:41] attilalfde: swiftyCOFFEE
[1:38:44] chin184: Do you think they will do classic plus?
[1:38:46] patison111: private server will be once again popular
[1:38:51] Kohvos: if there is enough interest we could see cata classic but idk
[1:38:51] chin184: or do you think it ends at wotlk
[1:38:54] Accountless_2012_to_2022: i think he means what is next for classic after wrath os over
[1:39:01] Kohvos: wrath gunna be so good
[1:39:02] chin184: I remember, i lvoed watching you
[1:39:04] rainraira: It was
[1:39:04] chin184: peak swifty
[1:39:10] chin184: peak youtube
[1:39:10] AddictedToZugs: i was there for all of it when i was a teenager it was awesome watching ur irl stuff
[1:39:12] stacktheripper: been waiting on wrath since classic
[1:39:15] rainraira: I enjoyed wrath
[1:39:28] itsmehippy: what servers should everyone go
[1:39:34] FlynnFluff: tbh i loved tbc but i could play wrath forever
[1:39:39] chin184: Will they make classic plus
[1:39:40] rainraira: Wrath was probably peak
[1:39:48] chin184: they want the sub count to go up lol
[1:39:51] botl0gic: I think dragonflight could be good though
[1:39:52] jacob_the_mage: My guess is wrath will come first, then dragonflight later
[1:39:54] tehgingerviking: same with SL and Naxx
[1:39:56] AddictedToZugs: WoW subs peaked in Cata
[1:39:57] Kohvos: they did the same thing with tbc/shadowlands didnt they?
[1:40:04] chopsaki: subs in toilet
[1:40:05] GroovyBryan: unless Wotlk is sooner than we thought
[1:40:08] Adaminko69: dragonflight
[1:40:11] ThisGuyisLocal: dragonflight?
[1:40:15] Kohvos: er yeah naxx/sl
[1:40:24] rainraira: @addictedtozugs cool
[1:40:26] AddictedToZugs: u guys should sub to swifty
[1:40:29] coder_paul: WoTLK will be bad without dungeon finder anyways
[1:40:30] AddictedToZugs: hes ur dad
[1:40:45] Cowardpatty: John, this needs to be a redeem. https://clips.twitch.tv/LuckyEmpathicAlbatrossJKanStyle-xCFx6Jag6D0rwarP
[1:40:50] rhyl4x: well wrath they not making any money but subscription unlike dragonflight in which they can charge people to by the exp
[1:41:03] rainraira: It'll be fine
[1:41:06] chin184: Will they do classic plus swifty or does wow fizzle out afteR?

[1:41:26] sintech1349: @Swifty you started your Youtube Carrier with Wrath? im 100% sure i saw incredible warrior tricks from you back in old TBC days

[1:41:41] DucaQA: How much? aprox

[1:43:05] difficulty21: 64 gigs of ddr5 goddamn

[1:45:18] Cowardpatty: PC prices were so high originally back in the 80's and early 90's, then they came down for a decade or 2, and now they're high again... speaking since
[1:45:22] Steelers067: yooo Swifty
[1:45:32] southywow: get origin pc to build u a pc
[1:45:33] inkognito3006: how much was the graphic card?
[1:45:33] rainraira: Using a full size case & have great airflow. Quiet fans too
[1:45:36] martyn47: @Swifty love the stream dude, always so positive, breath of fresh air
[1:45:53] geakedlol: hello swifty, how are you doing today?
[1:45:56] konczpete: hola swifty, como estás? espero que tenga una buena dia
[1:46:24] hectorlavo1: :) :) :)
[1:46:45] ask_peter: Hey @Swifty It has always been cheaper to order individual parts and assemble your pc yourself than to buy a complete system. nevertheless, this is not the ideal time for graphics cards. although they are no longer as expensive as they were a few months ago, they are still overpriced. The recent changes/expectations on the cryptocurrency market bring some hope. Despite all this, it is always an exciting and nice feeling to build your new pc and use it for the first time after setting it up.
[1:46:45] southywow: prot warrior on beta has insane dmg with sunwell gear
[1:46:48] geakedlol: hows the gear lookin?
[1:47:34] hectorlavo1: how long will take the grind for Shadowmourne?
[1:47:39] Thebulle: LHR cards
[1:47:44] tolumbusb: Hey swifty
[1:47:49] Rocno3: GREED
[1:48:04] southywow: graphic card in sweden expensive smh
[1:48:29] Cowardpatty: Floods in I think Taiwan back in 2008 affected a major HDD manufacturer's price

[1:49:42] Maurice_Deek: maybe you'll need a Blitzableiter as we have it in  germany
[1:49:53] rainraira: @bfrmars awesome
[1:50:09] f0rget05: when wotlk release?
[1:50:20] zomclown: go horde
[1:50:32] ask_peter: ideally, the components allow you to upgrade in two or more steps. for example, you can first upgrade the board, cpu and ram, if necessary, and later upgrade the ssds, gpu and stuff. nevertheless, i look forward to hearing from you when everything is assembled.
[1:50:33] Fooxfire: yesterday

[1:53:23] rainraira: BG was always fun
[1:53:33] southywow: hope they add rbgs to wotlk classic
[1:53:34] hextroe: I cant stand how slow classic is. So ~I stuck with retail
[1:53:44] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:53:46] DucaQA: hopefully, WotLK is the last Classic, then they should add things to it
[1:54:28] southywow: heroic leap pog
[1:54:32] konczpete: @hextroe same
[1:54:37] Don_Low: cata will come for sure
[1:54:53] Cowardpatty: I have no desire for Cata Classic, but I would definitely play a Classic MoP server
[1:54:54] FlynnFluff: cata assassin rogues with daggers yum
[1:55:01] nujja_: hopefully they keep wrath servers
[1:55:02] hextroe: Cata wasnt classic tho
[1:55:04] southywow: cata pvp was the best
[1:55:07] ohhshiftt: then mop then wod then legion
[1:55:09] KamenArt: they are going to end up going through all the expansions at this rate
[1:55:10] Debogotti219: please no cata classic ffs

[1:55:36] MaHonY_Timo: cata is nice :D i had 1 Button Macreos for lazy PvE Things ^^
[1:55:39] KodiakJedi: Going out on a limb...there will NEVER be a Shadowlands or BFA Classic.
[1:55:41] GroovyBryan: I highly doubt they will do this expansion again. lol it's been a bit of a dumpster fire.
[1:55:43] windfurie142: what was your favorite expansion pvp-wise?
[1:55:44] ask_peter: in like 2 years we have like  retail and same expansion classic :-))))))))
[1:55:44] hextroe: We are still in the cata world on retail
[1:55:54] Chirocken: I hope they start dropping the #nochanges rule after wrath though
[1:55:56] KamenArt: maybe they'll skip wod
[1:56:14] GroovyBryan: I want them to do a proper classic plus tbh
[1:56:17] nujja_: @Swifty u excited for wrath prot warriors?
[1:56:35] Neverm_re: KEK

[3:00:13] MADcefa: nah
[3:00:19] texerino: why do u think hes stream sniping
[3:00:31] throw_away1337: it's just an updated edition of the current one. Looks like the wotlk one but doesnt auto invite, and you have to go to the dungeon yourself, and no xp bonus at the end
[3:00:39] Steelers067: what I understand and read in article they are not bringing back l f g
[3:00:40] dropfen: there would be a huge shitstorm if it would and i bet like 40% of the playerbase would leave

[3:01:57] ajesetave: u gonna pvp mostly?
[3:02:05] poisonkana: Addons made the game unfair for the players who dont even use them, imo addons suck they should just add quality of life changes regularly in to the game it self
[3:02:21] babusch09: But seriously, Swifty. for you are right where you had more viewers, but now you can't say 100% that it is Stream Sniper ^^
[3:02:41] MisterThatDude: If you watch anyone with the beta they already have the new LFG system, its kinda like the BC classic one but updated! not like you just Q for a dungeon

[6:07:53] Hamners: its all about holy pally in wrath
[6:08:09] Hanscakestealer: thats not true I played ret all through wrath they were amazing at the start
[6:08:10] dustysubaru: tbh its a great expansion for paladins to be op. lore wise. im not a paladin but they deserve the credit

[6:09:01] Frankenstein_Gaming: human pally it is
