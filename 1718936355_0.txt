[1:22:12] Molvonos: @killerteapotsftw You've got to make him aware of the redemption.  There's no noise or alarm that lets him know anything's been redeemed.

[1:23:40] smokemanjays: go look at forums alot of ppl got gamebreaking stutters for no reason
[1:23:46] Skizzurp: i mean they had like 10 hour maintenance
[1:23:50] Skizzurp: now we have another
[1:23:53] Skizzurp: shit tilts people
[1:23:53] notn3w: 500 gold for that? dang
[1:24:00] Masqerader: @LiLJiTxDH no, i just think it funny you assume what other people do or don't do in game matters.. I avoid most world quest too, but to say "no one does wq" or lump a bunch of people together, whoopy
[1:24:09] Keyastaron_: its buggy @Towelliee
[1:24:20] soysos91: "fix your game blizz!" but also "why you shutting down to fix your game?!"
[1:24:21] mavericks312: @skizzurp it's almost like there fixing stuff

[1:25:37] mmrghost7: do u think algethar academy needs more time on m+  ?
[1:25:42] newwayz92: LOL
[1:26:08] Skizzurp: orbs dropped to 1300 only they were like 10+ early on
[1:26:13] mayonaes: Brew feels good though
[1:26:16] mavericks312: nah only HoV and CoS could use more time and that's only cause of rp

[1:26:38] Lloyder47: I mean at this point though should warriors be nerfed or other tanks brought to their standard?
[1:26:40] Maxoru0: I think av needs more time

[1:28:06] lucid_wow: @iiTornTunaii bro that tier set was disgusting, really awful to play imo tho
[1:28:14] sliproach: @Screamnsteam the same jsut teh icons look different now
[1:28:18] Vadagar1: Yeah, they're death strikes are like Lay on Hands.
[1:28:21] NBK_Sethus: cheesing a couple of raid mechanics is all blood dk is good for
[1:28:22] PierrickGT: [SERVER] Shutdown in 8:00
[1:28:22] dutchie76: how are blood dks in keys?
[1:28:27] Scarhearth: lets not nerf BDK and say we did Kappa
[1:28:31] mmrghost7: Bdk ST DMG already lacks
[1:28:40] AshhTV: can you show your talents?
[1:28:43] lucid_wow: blood dk feels like such a weird spec where just off design alone its either broken op or insanely weak but they cant really just make it mid bc of how its designed
[1:28:54] NierrEdits: warr/bdk are the easiest two to run with in keys imo
[1:28:55] Rudric_Ice: Blood dks are Guzzlers
[1:28:56] lucid_wow: honestly warrior brew dh and dk are all really good in keys
[1:29:02] The_Metal_Man: bdk is insanely punishing
[1:29:04] NierrEdits: Monks stocks going up but only at highest level
[1:29:07] Snabido: Pray your shields and will of necro keeps you alive until you get enough RP
[1:29:11] lirly__: is BDK easy to pick up? ive only ever played unholy
[1:29:37] LoremasterMarthan: Wrath lol
[1:29:42] The_Metal_Man: @poggz__one bdk is probably the hardest tank, but imo its the most fun
[1:29:43] lucid_wow: @poggz__one its prob the most challenging tank spec (bdk or brew) but when u get it down its easily the most rewarding too
[1:29:56] day_delay: @poggz__one I've played frost and unholy before and trying out blood this expansion. So far it is alot of fun.
[1:29:58] mmrghost7: bdk u dont have DRW up ? u better respect autoattacks of trash
[1:30:00] Lilurrn: server shutdown 6m
[1:30:11] Skyymarshal: BDK takes a ridiculous amount of damage compared to others it feels like.
[1:30:12] JFeezy__: i main vdh and have been tanking our raids. Missed a week cause the wife had surgery and they replaces with bdk. so now its pally and bdk... Makes some of the fights miserable. Dathea for example.
[1:30:18] CeruleanStar: i think BDK is pretty easy and really fun i just didn't want to lead m+ groups lol
[1:30:25] Cheapesttactics1: for fun
[1:30:31] CeruleanStar: blood boil good for initial aggro on aoe packs
[1:30:32] The_Metal_Man: Yea you have empty globals rn for BB
[1:30:34] Nerdmeat_: IDK if it's good but I enjoy it
[1:30:38] CeruleanStar: but that's all i use it for
[1:30:44] 1amghost7: Can anyonne tell me if i craft a minimal ilvl elemental lariat or the titanic signet can i upgrade it to ilvl 418 later down the line or do i have to recraft the entire thing???
[1:30:44] Mecabeast: you do it just to set up the dot right?
[1:30:47] lirly__: might level mine in timewalking lol
[1:30:49] NBK_Sethus: bdk is paper, death strike nerf would make them unplayable
[1:30:53] Vadagar1: Blood Boil good aoe agro
[1:30:59] Cabbageman007: Farming for Sparks is the new Meta
[1:31:02] mmrghost7: nononono thats s3 and s4 stuff
[1:31:12] lucid_wow: @Skyymarshal its by design, instead of mitigating a lot of damage like other tanks (prot warr and brew especially), dk takes most of the dmg up front and heal it back with death strike
[1:31:12] Nerdmeat_: Yeah I have to taunt/grip more than I used to
[1:31:13] mmrghost7: we dont have that anymore
[1:31:15] CeruleanStar: yep i found threat a bit of an isssue too but figured hta twas just me being bad
[1:31:17] 1wex_1: In my raid I always pull get threat then dk taunts
[1:31:24] Cheapesttactics1: that gets me killed is warrior burst dps
[1:31:31] dreamwalker213: @1amghost7 you have to get it redrafted, but it requires less mats
[1:31:35] NierrEdits: Yeah only problem with BDK is aggro LUL I play devoker and unless i have a rogue or hunter in my keys I need to wait a solid 5 seconds before I hit my go
[1:31:50] Rudric_Ice: I lvled my first  BDK and didnt do any m+ just straight raiding honestly its much easier than doing M+
[1:31:51] mmrghost7: our ST dmg sucks hard
[1:32:14] lucid_wow: bro grip taunt is so nice, i remember playing bdk back in nyalotha and we cheesed shad'har every week with double taunt (other tank was pwarr so he took every big phys tank buster i took every big magic tank buster)
[1:32:18] 1amghost7: well shit.  @dreamwalker213 is it worth it to craft it at lower ilvl???
[1:32:21] 1wex_1: 1_wex_1 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:32:24] Skyymarshal: @lucid_wow Yeah, i know, therefore im a tad sceptical about nerfing the self-sustain of bdk, since they fall over if you just blows at it :P
[1:32:25] lucid_wow: like grip taunt is pretty niche but its so cool
[1:32:27] 1amghost7: like it doenst take another spark of inginuity does it
[1:33:16] abracka_: how about ESO launching their new chapter/expansion a day before D4 launches lol
[1:33:18] cardfrek: cardfrek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[1:33:27] dreamwalker213: @1amghost7 if you don’t have the focus and base ilvl is an upgrade yeah sure why not. It doesn’t cost a spark or chaos to recraft. Just a few mats and artisan mettle
[1:33:29] Mecabeast: I wiped my group on grim totem on pull cause I was 2nd tank and pulled off our brew during the frontal
[1:33:36] mmrghost7: bro bring TD back BDKs will out dps half the dps players in raids :)

[1:42:41] Dred_Scythe: The early access will already be going. They choose POORLY.
[1:42:47] abracka_: they have to  know D4 is launching the next day right?  there's no way they don't know   that

[1:43:39] kalamari__: @abracka_ maybe they think ESO and D4 players dont have a big overlap. who knows
[1:43:41] inj0shwetrust: I still gotta pre purch D4
[1:43:45] Skizzurp: i wish d4 was closer to d3 than d2 tho ill prob still play for a couple weeks tho
[1:43:47] Aervyper: so if diablo IV is so great why aren't you logging on to Diablo Immortal right now?
[1:43:49] inj0shwetrust: The wow mount is sick
[1:43:56] Rudric_Ice: already got the gold edition of D4 can't wait
[1:43:57] YinYangMan77: It was.
[1:44:02] WhiteKnight74648: I still be playing lost ark if the grind wasn't so rediculous
[1:44:09] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:44:09] PvtHudson093: then everyone went back to wow

[1:44:10] Phil87z: Who do you like in the championship games this weekend?
[1:44:18] im_capy: basically once you hit end game
[1:44:27] imvitalx: I want the D4 collectors edition but it doesn't come with the game lol
[1:44:30] SeckSymbols: @imvitalx Knowing the Riot playerbase and the massive success all their games seem to have, I could easily see their MMO taking over the top spot
[1:44:30] qufad: yeah the grind in lost ark is stupid. hard to play as a side game
[1:44:30] charizard_main: The grind got too stale
[1:44:33] WhiteKnight74648: Bengles to the superbowl?
[1:44:37] YinYangMan77: I got my Destroyer up to 1410 and quit
[1:44:37] GodKingMuninn: Wait didn't the people who Pre-order d4 get to play a few days early?
[1:44:38] TheCliffyShow: And now they announced they are censoring some of the female outfits to fit "western norms". That's gonna go over well.
[1:44:42] MetalJoshP: gotta go bengals and niners
[1:44:44] denzau: also riot mmo will be bigger than lost ark for sure. all those riot games fans will also jump on it. lol and valorant have extreme reach.
[1:44:45] PvtHudson093: Cowboys so close
[1:45:00] WhiteKnight74648: Bangles and 49ers would be a great superbowl
[1:45:07] SeckSymbols: Cowboys are never close
[1:45:16] Elitestormstrike: riot mmo will fail
[1:45:18] Tyr7: D3 was nice fun, i remember buying overwatch just to get wings in d3
[1:45:18] AgentWhiskeyy: you heard them naming arrow stadium Burrowhead stadium because Burrows just dogs Mahomes
[1:45:18] Phil87z: Anyone but Philly for me
[1:45:20] Cabbageman007: What place did you finish in Poker tournament
[1:45:24] im_capy: Curious how the Riot MMo hurts LoL numbers
[1:45:25] imvitalx: @SeckSymbols I can see it. I just think WoW is in a good spot right now too and to me it could only get better (unless they really mess something up lol)
[1:45:30] SeckSymbols: Riot is a goliath
[1:45:44] kowaikokoro: even arcane did incredibly well
[1:45:47] Skizzurp: plus riot mmo has ghostcrawler on it who was on original wow dev
[1:45:48] paterick: Philly going to the ship!
[1:45:54] Calphurnious: I was hyped for LoL MMO but LoL has been getting worse every year so I don't know anymore tbh
[1:45:57] Poriand: Thing that could kill riot mmo is it’s monetization
[1:45:58] badgrandpa73: Sup Toewelliee, it's my birthday today. THE BIG 5-0! Can I win the 3090? :)
[1:46:01] Aervyper: @Towelliee Riot MMO will have 1 million viewers concurrent for the entire week
[1:46:01] im_capy: Big things can fail, will it
[1:46:03] HonestPhilosophy: Cant wait to play it
[1:46:05] im_capy: no
[1:46:10] Mallaes: Ghostcrawler 🦀
[1:46:10] inj0shwetrust: Theyre for sure cooking up something
[1:46:11] TheCliffyShow: Blizzard is gonna shit themselves when Riot starts showing footage of that game.
[1:46:16] MetalJoshP: i hope the riot mmo is amazing firstly a new game to play is always great and competition for wow is a very good thing to force the mto step up
[1:46:17] SeckSymbols: Riot MMO will certainly be F2P
[1:46:18] AgentWhiskeyy: league of Legends will always be the best computer game
[1:46:34] DonnyWixx: still a LoL theme mmo not a lot of people like that toxic game

[1:46:54] SeckSymbols: @DonnyWixx Millions of people like LoL
[1:46:56] abracka_: tbh i think they're going to adapt ESO's subscription model. free to play,  but if you sub you get a  bunch of benefits
[1:46:59] im_capy: If anything, the community will over hype it and eat themselves as worst case
[1:47:01] blumoomoon: o.o
[1:47:02] kaileybubz: riot mmo is called Tarisland
[1:47:03] Skizzurp: i could see it being free with a monthyl fast pass shit
[1:47:04] paterick: the only mmo I play are wow I used to play eso
[1:47:04] Cheapesttactics1: who you think is going to the super bowl?  I'm going cheifs and 49ers rematch
[1:47:04] GodKingMuninn: LoL is an amazing game, just the people suck.
[1:47:04] kappaday23: Kappa
[1:47:08] faulen: They will have the MMO China market on lock KappaCool

[1:47:46] mavericks312: eh I won't be touching riots mmo
[1:47:47] Calphurnious: Wasn't there already a video with ghostcrawler talking about the monetization for it
[1:47:47] Visuals66: League is a what doing 20+ keys in pugs is like LOL
[1:48:09] Endin: what is going to be chaos?
[1:48:14] Endin: of riot mmo
[1:48:17] Skizzurp: idk about miss a race cuz thats their income
[1:48:19] clapzyfrr: Riot is superior and nothing even compares to them, Riot MMO is going to be MASSIVE
[1:48:19] Bedpan_BoB: Ill take a break from wow to check it out.
[1:48:19] SeckSymbols: Best case scenario for WoW is if it were to drop during a .5 patch or a during last patch between expansions
[1:48:21] Tyr7: the graphics looks really nice in riot mmo
[1:48:23] Aervyper: people will straight up leave guilds just yea i'm gone
[1:48:24] adam6683: Would you say setting up elvUI the first time will take a long time?
[1:48:28] faulen: Realm List up
[1:48:29] Skizzurp: but max has said he will def play it
[1:48:30] MetalJoshP: and thats a good thing because it checks wow hard and makes them have to put out better content

[1:48:37] warrenny: League is boring af
[1:48:38] Dred_Scythe: Wouldn't be surprised to see the ARPG genre be hit hard for a little bit if the game has decent combat.
[1:48:41] AgentWhiskeyy: your hat is fire what does it say on it? the color is sick
[1:48:44] Wukain: they will do both they have the man power to do so
[1:48:50] nouwandhi: What game?
[1:48:52] imvitalx: It could flop like Anthem did
[1:48:54] Crowargus: needs endgame at start
[1:48:56] faulen: cough WildStar cough
[1:48:57] Itshiko: If you still play LoL in 2023, you're a fucking nerd
[1:49:07] GodKingMuninn: With the dev team they have, no way that happens.
[1:49:09] Skizzurp: in ghost interview he already said that if shit isnt great they scrap it
[1:49:12] clapzyfrr: It's not going to flop there's no chance
[1:49:13] AgentWhiskeyy: whats your hat say?
[1:49:13] im_capy: Musk has a lot of money and is kinda fucking shit up
[1:49:19] Aervyper: @Towelliee Riot MMO would be Wildstar launch on 100X crack
[1:49:23] SeckSymbols: Gonna have player housing then LUL
[1:49:25] Calphurnious: @warrenny I feel that. I think it was fun pre SR map skin rework
[1:49:28] coldarmorTBG: oh Ghostcrawler is in on it??
[1:49:29] Phil87z: It isn't coming anytime soon
[1:49:42] Tyr7: its coming off similar lore to wow
[1:49:43] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite
[1:49:46] Crowargus: gc knows that formula :)
[1:49:50] Karn1987: @Towelliee good morning and chat
[1:49:54] SeckSymbols: Riot MMO alpha/beta I could see 2024/2025
[1:49:55] sifer007: riot is going to finish wow for good
[1:49:57] BowSec: cough... New World, Wildstar
[1:50:01] Murlock07: Facts
[1:50:05] MedicineMan: kinda hard to make a WoW player quit a game they've been playing for 18 years
[1:50:07] kowaikokoro: its that simple
[1:50:08] Zettabyte: Towel has spoken!
[1:50:08] Itshiko: dont pull an amazon/elden rng
[1:50:12] MuenCheese: Wildstar was so fun
[1:50:16] day_delay: Wildstar was great.
[1:50:21] GodKingMuninn: The reason wow suceeded is they did what they used to do best. Take a good idea, and refine that shit.
[1:50:23] Murlock07: damn I miss Wildstar
[1:50:24] im_capy: meanwhile AoC....LUL
[1:50:25] SiriusNick: Yeah I miss wildstar =(
[1:50:25] Sayryn: Which will be out first Riot MMO or AoC?
[1:50:31] AgentWhiskeyy: great but dead
[1:50:31] tkzod: you speak so highly of it
[1:50:33] nouwandhi: @Towelliee Which game are you taliking about?
[1:50:37] Vesidian: where did wildstar go wrong?
[1:50:40] kriiuss: I won a copy of Wildstar from this stream lol
[1:50:40] TheCliffyShow: I don't play League of Legends or any of it's spin-offs, but the world looks interesting. So, I'll definitely check out the MMO unless they announce something that turns me way off.
[1:50:49] MedicineMan: Fair point
[1:50:49] Gigantelope: wildstar came out at a time when people werent hungry for something new. no one was ready to break from wow
[1:50:52] PvtHudson093: i think your overhyping it
[1:50:53] Foxdoabarrelrofl: wildstar just used attunements which was an antiquated system and it killed enthusiasm
[1:50:57] SpoofAvatar: RIOT MMO will put pressure on WOW to do better / more
[1:50:59] B3reft: didn't that kind of happen with ffxiv?
[1:51:01] SeckSymbols: @MedicineMan Wouldnt need to quit WoW if the LoL MMO is F2P
[1:51:01] WhiteKnight74648: It's fairly easy to quit wow honestly. If dragonflight had bad reviews, i still wouldn't be playing it.
[1:51:02] mavericks312: not if wow is the only mmo you play no o e is gonna care about riots mmo
[1:51:02] NVbrutal: the riot mmo is gonna have the most toxic community out of any mmo lol
[1:51:04] Skizzurp: plus u can always take a raid tier off and come back to wow and regear
[1:51:04] Aervyper: @Towelliee i am old enough to remember the people said the same thing about EQ 1 and EQ 2
[1:51:08] HonestPhilosophy: Play all mmo's, easy fix
[1:51:08] Maxoru0: I think it's change over time, wow players are giving other games a shot
[1:51:09] Murlock07: @vesidian Advertising it
[1:51:09] Phil87z: Its going to take alot to pull me from Wow. That sunk cost fallacy
[1:51:10] EmpathyLiveChat: yes, part of the reason wow is popular is because wow is popular :)
[1:51:10] AgentWhiskeyy: whats the name of this new game he keeps talking about lol?

And it has been removed from steam "presumably" due to trademark. Pretty sure steam just asked for verification that the game was real, and they couldn't give it

[4:22:19] xmedpakx: why would anyone hate ppl for playing it?
[4:22:24] gritbarontv: over a game, dam.
[4:22:25] Rudric_Ice: people who actually wants to play it gonna play it
[4:22:26] xmedpakx: i am confused
[4:22:26] PvtHudson093: @ZeusDNA call the character Hairy Plopper
[4:22:32] zenFX_: @Nerdmeat_ I assure you, there are more uninformed sheeps that just jump on the bandwagon uninformed
[4:22:37] maximusau: I heard the drama about, but I didn't know streamers were being threatened for playing it.
[4:22:41] Outerlaw: People just like to hate anything to be edgy
[4:22:42] 1llum1n471: So, I'm out of the loop, what's the deal with HW:Legacy? Like, why the hate?
[4:22:43] ZeusDNA: @PvtHudson093 KEKW that'd be great
[4:22:48] pereadin: @xmedpakx JKR said some “hateful” things
[4:22:48] TuffnSnuff: I thjink iits the stupidest thing ever. People cry over everything. its a game
[4:22:50] 60White: Why are ppl so angry about the Harry Potter game?
[4:23:17] TuffnSnuff: how cards what she said
[4:23:21] TuffnSnuff: cares
[4:23:24] xmedpakx: oh
[4:23:25] Sollice: We aren't going to constantly go over the issue. Just google it
[4:23:26] maximusau: wow, the reviews and gameplay looks great.

[4:23:56] kokochris: oof
[4:24:04] LoremasterMarthan: *Ronin disliked that*
[4:24:07] Nerdmeat_: Garrosh accidentally mass murdered its all good now tho

[4:24:42] Rudric_Ice: well im watching lirik when pogwarts comes out and he dont give a f about ''issues''
[4:24:45] Foretoldlegends: The cata oriented timewalking vendors are near the portals for the cata zones.
[4:24:56] xo_navi: Yeah most people aren't really that into harry potter the movies are just good
[4:24:56] notdustinx: i just wanna be worse than voldemort dont care lmaooo
[4:25:19] pereadin: @dustinthewind95 KEKW
[4:25:20] notdustinx: Im gonna play it just to make Voldemort look like a street act
[4:25:30] ZeusDNA: Personally, I just want a super sick wizard game. That's all I really care about haha

[4:26:40] Cryin_freeman: its always been that small
[4:26:49] AamiraCat: They need to give us 620 flying in old zones now that we're all used to dragonriding lol
[4:26:55] pereadin: I’ve heard stories of MJordan being racist towards his own people and everything.
[4:27:08] Cryin_freeman: yeah
[4:27:21] PvtHudson093: Silithus
[4:27:22] Dox023: @towelliee It probably feels slow because even 310% sucks anus compared to the 800-1300% you can get with dragon riding.
[4:27:30] Snabido: Maybe desolace too?
[4:27:31] g0n_z3n: Yeah that should be lvl 40+
[4:27:39] Snabido: Kinda iffy on that

[4:32:18] spookychefkarolina: I have been waiting eons for the prophesy of the Boomer Blast
[4:32:36] gidgeet: I wish there was some casino's near me in Tallahassee FL lol I have to drive a good ways to get one
[4:32:40] lawles_walrus: @megaton238 go the absolute fuck away with that shit
[4:32:55] Battakoru: Ohh @Heero_Effect haha This is firs time that I see that
[4:33:03] notadambraz: what european football teams u betting on?
[4:33:15] pereadin: @megaton238 I’d say hunt is a little extreme. But permitting open carry and making it more accessible allows law abiding citizens to defend when present. It’s not hard. States with strict gun laws have more made shootings than states with lax gun laws.
[4:33:49] spookychefkarolina: Aw thank you Towel towLove
[4:34:04] pereadin: How long does level 25 take in raid shadow legends btw?
[4:34:12] megaton238: I was being a bit tongue-in-cheek there, but the point is that changing gun laws in California doesn't do anything to people who can bring in guns from other states.
[4:34:12] Clay2K_: @towelliee can you say what flavor boomer blast is?
[4:34:42] banditrox12: @Clay2K_ boomer blast Kappa
[4:34:58] Sollice: Ohh i know I know
[4:35:00] LoremasterMarthan: It's sock on head flavored
[4:35:01] Outerlaw: Towelliee has always had the best giveaways, I’ve been gone 5 yrs and he still flexing his giveaway skills
[4:35:02] pereadin: @megaton238 but allowing your citizens easier access to defend themselves does do something.
[4:35:05] lawles_walrus: its in the name, its boomer blast duh
[4:35:09] Cello_73: @megaton238 you are thinking about it the wrong way. Your gun laws in CA do nothing, if someone really wants a gun they will get it and they dont have to come from another state
[4:35:13] Brodih_: back pain creme sent flavour
[4:35:24] lawles_walrus: @pereadin dont take the bait lol
[4:35:47] pereadin: Let’s chill with the gun law talk though. I know towel doesn’t like politics in here.
