[5:28:49] Madness187inc: hm
[5:28:53] eEKBAh: yea, after lirik played the teaser he said it felt like a tech demo
[5:28:54] MDCharged: cause the main camera is angled?
[5:28:55] KilaBeee: ur viewing it from the side
[5:28:55] g0nza_a: that animations and etc its so similar to spellbreak
[5:28:56] KilaBeee: lol
[5:28:57] Madness187inc: ugh its poopoo game
[5:29:00] ATinyBoatGhost: it was made originally as a ue5 demo wasnt it?
[5:29:00] vangrit: it should at least slant the opposite direction for a bubble effect
[5:29:00] CardboardHorde: That tilt is usually used to represent the angle a HUD would be on a helmet, but it doesn't make sense
[5:29:03] CynisterZ: ya that looks dumb

[5:29:17] N0SSH: look at the letters
[5:29:19] TheComposer132: Lirik played it, believe he said the combat was pretty good but the story/acting/performance was meh at best
[5:29:21] KilaBeee: we need a matrix game
[5:29:24] ChileDPS: I still feel like the Harry Potter game will be the biggest let down of the year
[5:29:24] trackerpr0: you gonna play. hogwarts legacy @shroud

[5:29:50] bigbirdsWords: you dont like final fantasy so why even bother
[5:29:51] JaBuLs: just get Atomic Heart instead of this garbage
[5:29:54] PROTOTYPICAI_: why the HUD feels like we're playing on a CRT lol
[5:29:55] YoungDoesGaming: it looks like a old tv blend
[5:29:56] ChubbyMikey: No, they went stylistic and zipped right past good
[5:30:01] N3ptuChan: @shroud you mean a Technical Demo?

[5:30:07] default_guy77: square enix, what have you done? elisFail
[5:30:08] edenobi: it looks like different stock assets from engine, without any changes
[5:30:08] Dixie_Deee: you're not. you're spot on
[5:30:11] galactic_pi: I got a feeling it’s going to be a anthem like game it’s being overhyped a lot of articles are saying it’s going to be good xD

[5:30:12] Madness187inc: naaaaaaahhhhhhh
[5:30:17] nimbleop: lirik played it.. looked pretty good.
[5:30:18] shureiny: Movement looks like it'll give a feeling of freedom
[5:30:19] StathamFPS: ppl complain when its the same cookie cutter and they complain when its different u cant win
[5:30:20] anakonda1112: maybe it looks cool in vr
[5:30:21] iainbrux: Just make a WoW 2 in UE5 and make is console compatible man it's all that we need

[5:30:38] sai1orjerry: @shroud looks like a bootleg JRPG
[5:30:38] Madness187inc: it kinda looks like they wanted to throw as much particle shit on screen
[5:30:39] MadlifeElements: its so dark WTF
[5:30:40] CraniumCrank: this game is just a particle simulator
[5:30:41] default_guy77: @nimblesly but, the bitrate sodaCry
[5:30:42] ChubbyMikey: I have no idea @DrakeOVO
[5:30:43] DPedestrian: perhaps they did it to allow for VR so the UI is in space?
[5:30:46] chusteda: They’re trying to be NextGen and don’t realize how dumb it looks. It doesn’t have to be the greatest looking—look at how many play PONG still has.
[5:30:46] warzazzat: Sonic frontier gamplay
[5:30:48] KilaBeee: y is it so dark?
[5:30:50] agentmayhem97: movement like naraka bladepoint
[5:30:51] NightcoreKirito: visuals look epic

[6:03:34] Paytah: @austrie101 I dont want to answer that cuz it could potentially break this communities guidelines
[6:03:43] henrythemonster2006: it's pretty good for casual play
[6:03:43] PsyNytes: Nah you can answer @Paytah <3
[6:03:47] 2GramsofJam: Yes very playable as a casual
[6:03:49] BadBaneling: dragonflight is most fun expansion in a while
[6:03:55] Paytah: @PsyNytes ahh.. ok..didnt wanna promote in another stream
[6:04:03] pigthumper: @im__peanut this is probably the easierst expansion they have made for casuals
[6:04:03] PsyNytes: No worries, appreciate the caution
[6:04:10] metroboomer52: dragonflight is awesome
[6:04:16] austrie101: @Paytah one of the mods just dropped his twitch all g
[6:04:33] partypants1133: ulduar is pre-patch ulduar, which means it'll be hard as fuck at first
[6:04:37] henrythemonster2006: what was the promoting you asked about (just nosey)?
[6:04:39] surpriseparty20: @im__peanut It's hard to play solo . If u find a casual guild that does some keyes and raid logging it's fine imo . DF Is prob the most casual friendly retail has been in years
