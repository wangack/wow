[0:07:35] jgbrit: I spent today discovering how obnoxiously rare some wild pets are. It took me about 6 hours to farm a rare (blue) Rat Snake in Duskwood because that's the only zone they appear
[0:07:37] jarkklet: your hair looks good

[0:10:10] Zuldak: you're brave pickles. I couldnt heal my way out of a wet paper bag. If a 488 tank was against a critter and i was healing, somehow the tnak would die
[0:10:36] jgbrit: I spent today discovering how obnoxiously rare some wild pets are. It took me about 6 hours to farm a rare (blue) Rat Snake in Duskwood because that's the only zone they appear
[0:10:57] TheBenXO: So the tea matches the wig
[0:10:58] amaya21: wow!
[0:10:59] Zuldak: raspberry?
[0:11:02] sence_00: oh matchy matchy with the hair
[0:11:09] sence_00: youll need wig themed tea from now on
[0:11:19] Zuldak: Kings rest? Rustfeather?
[0:11:28] Greevers: been watching back your PVP stuff for mount, gonna try it myself!
[0:11:37] sence_00: we can help with those though
[0:11:54] amaya21: mint tea for the green wig
[0:12:20] cashthb: yo
[0:12:21] witchhobbit: i have been leveling my disc priest more and i'm liking it more than holy priest now sairaChefskiss
[0:12:49] eielwind: did solo shuffle last night and lost 150 rating :(
[0:12:52] witchhobbit: but wow all the priest spells are so pretty
[0:13:03] Greevers: how long does it take to get the vicious mount if you're terrible like me? lol
[0:13:11] cashthb: 1500 is pretty much free on a healer, droppin gonna take lie a billion losses
[0:13:30] Greevers: woop
[0:13:45] Greevers: thinking of doing on BM hunter
[0:13:57] Greevers: so the pets do the work lol

[0:14:29] witchhobbit: you want to try pvp on another class?
[0:14:31] azrazil720: I just leveled my BM hunter and it's so fun!!
[0:14:45] fallingupwards: Do you have a faster que as a healer for the solo shuffle? I waited in que for 15m as a dps before I afkd lol
[0:14:47] Greevers: @eielwind that's good cos I don't want aggro when trying it :D
[0:15:07] Greevers: but reading some guides etc, just need some actual PVP gear on fresh 70
[0:15:27] xxtractormattxx: you're the best!!!
[0:15:30] Greevers: is honor acc wide?
[0:15:49] Greevers: woooop
[0:15:55] Kurama__95: You could casually get pvp gear through the PvP world quest and get bloody tokens
[0:16:28] amy_star_a: Blizzard? Confusing? Crazy talk!
[0:16:34] cashthb: can't honor be sent over on a reduced rate too?
[0:16:47] Greevers: @Kurama__95 thanks, I think I'll need to unlock Emerald Dream and do some there - what do bloody tokens give?
[0:17:23] WhippWhapp: @McGreevers the hellbloom set, very easy to get
[0:17:35] Greevers: yes currencies confuse me
[0:17:45] cashthb: you could start with the mage one :)
[0:17:49] Greevers: @WhippWhapp thanks!!
[0:17:53] witchhobbit: yeah you mostly just need to do the class campaigns now
[0:17:57] sence_00: they are a little timegated if you havent done all the class hall campaign
[0:17:58] witchhobbit: and whatever the mount quest is
[0:17:58] Kurama__95: @McGreevers There's a WQ in the dragon isles, one in ZC and one in ED, they all give bloody tokens, which can be traded for gear equivalent to honor gear, and upgraded to conquest level (i think)
[0:18:00] Hillside_: i was so proud of myself for getting all of them when it was current
[0:18:15] jgbrit: Wouldn't it be an idea to try and chip away at Karokta before TWW?
[0:18:16] Kurama__95: @McGreevers And unlike the other kinds of WQs, PvP WQs reset daily
[0:18:21] eielwind: did the 10 gift subs not count? just curious and dont want them to be overlooked :D
[0:18:32] Greevers: @Kurama__95 Thank you!!! Copying this so I can refer back when I get in :D
[0:18:32] witchhobbit: you'll have to make a mage for the class mount then tho sairaLUL
[0:18:39] WhippWhapp: @WhippWhapp with Trophies of strife, you can get it at veteran level and convert into tier in the catalyst
[0:18:59] Greevers: just found PVP hard to get into
[0:19:03] Kurama__95: @McGreevers You're welcome! Good luck on your PvP adventures!
[0:19:25] Daemavand: Are the Legion mounts still a mega slog?
[0:19:39] Greevers: @Kurama__95 thanks!! Lots and lots of death :D
[0:19:47] eielwind: i was frustrated last night because i waas 1680 rating and it put me with people with 0 and 800 rating, so even though they lost 5 games they gainted rating and i lost
[0:19:57] witchhobbit: @Daemavand not if you already did the legionfall campaign once
[0:19:57] Ujai321: You actually did it
[0:19:58] Kurama__95: @Daemavand Not as much, you can skip the Broken Shore part now, but does require the Order Hall campaign
[0:20:13] Ujai321: And we are having technical issues, classic twitch
[0:20:31] wolfcloudchaser80: I didn't even notice that
[0:20:46] Daemavand: We can blame PVP brain
[0:20:49] supatease: you can take hazel out of the arena but you cant take the arena out of hazel
[0:21:08] Daemavand: True!
[0:21:14] miea15: Hey hazel! How many attempts did the necrolord egg mounts take you to get? I just managed to land my last one after 261 attempts!
[0:21:40] Kurama__95: Maybe if they take the mount off arena, they take Hazel out of the arena LUL
[0:21:54] eziekiyah: lol I love how the core of your soul has pencil shavings
[0:22:00] Daemavand: I think it'll become much more fun as you've decided to do a little bit every day
[0:22:11] Daemavand: rather than the "omg I need to do this all in one week" slog lol
[0:22:13] Greevers: I just panic at PVP especially arena but it is fun!
[0:22:19] Ujai321: Sweaty at the top, sweaty in the middle... There has to be a joke somewhere in here
[0:22:34] fisherreads: haven‚Äôt seen many evokers in pvp
[0:22:47] Daemavand: @Ujai321 There is but I'm not allowed to say it in chat :D

[0:23:09] MikeT298: MikeT298 is continuing the Gift Sub they got from Daemavand! 
[0:23:17] eielwind: it sure is lol
[0:23:19] Daemavand: Surprise!
[0:23:25] supatease: is that an irl health pot
[0:23:50] Kurama__95: Guildie got the heroic omni token day 1 of season through PvP LUL
[0:24:11] rangergreyson: have to the order hall questlines, some invasions, and broken shore questline.
[0:24:29] Ujai321: Better drink that pot quickly, your green bar over your head is at only 12%
[0:24:46] rangergreyson: some of the quests involve doing mission table missions
[0:25:27] wolfcloudchaser80: 12%? I'm surprised she doesn't have pulsating red in her peripheral vision!
[0:25:36] crystalsing3r: The table missions have been shortened quite a bit I think an hour
[0:25:37] sence_00: I did them at the end of BFA and they were really chill, but repetative if you have to do the Broken Shore achieve on each toon. Maybe thats what they changed though
[0:26:51] themaykr_: KITTY
[0:27:08] bread1oaf1: nice transmog, can you should it off more?
[0:27:14] bread1oaf1: show*

[0:29:14] Ujai321: I mean, you would be supporting the estate even with the bundle
[0:29:20] Ujai321: But at a discount!
[0:29:24] Greevers: that tea looks so yummy
[0:29:24] Ujai321: Presumably
[0:29:29] russtrotter: i've missed a bunch of streams in the last month, is hazel in her wig phase or did the buzz get grown out and pinkified?
[0:29:32] jeffdmk: support the estate does no have exactly the same level of motivation as supporting the author
[0:30:08] wolfcloudchaser80: The actor Paul Newman did exactly that. Via salad dressing of all things.
[0:30:20] IglooMan45: Do you wear wigs
[0:30:21] russtrotter: "big buzz" lobby is pleased with your decision
[0:30:28] Daemavand: You're definitely having fun with the wigs which is cool to see :D
[0:30:29] canadianmetriclobster: there is a chunk at your arm that is squinting at me

[0:30:43] cashthb: you might eng up in a Nobel prize situation where you end up fundind weird stuff
[0:30:51] jeffdmk: so now your stream is acting and you are no longer genuine i understand
[0:30:54] loenhart: lol
[0:30:55] fallingupwards: I used to do hair and I tell people all the time to do wigs if you want the fashion colors cause the damage done to their hair isn't worth it lol
[0:30:57] Ujai321: The wig is now part of the stream persona
[0:30:59] tildo03: This stream is based on a lie
[0:31:04] canadianmetriclobster: ahhh saying that sumoned my own chunk to sit on me
[0:31:04] Perkolate: gz on the socket!
[0:31:20] Daemavand: lol
[0:31:29] fisherreads: the white color of that robe is nice

[0:33:43] cashthb: gold farming stream? :O firelands + potion of luck, let's gp

[0:35:20] Ujai321: You did, but I forgot what
[0:35:41] wolfcloudchaser80: I accidentally bought 601 awakened frost instead of 60 once. Most profitable mistake I ever made.
[0:35:50] MikeT298: Once I bought an entire stack  of enchants at one price (like 115) instead of just one from the AH

[0:37:48] cashthb: tick EVERYTHING!
[0:37:54] wolfcloudchaser80: It's actually kinda interesting to watch you figuring out the behind-the-scenes Twitch stuff. I'm genuinely curious
[0:38:09] Daemavand: D:
[0:38:10] Samordorak: WoD was the last time I seriously pvp'd
[0:38:12] mcxoney: wow thats honestly impressive
[0:38:14] Daemavand: that IS traumatic
[0:38:14] eielwind: triggered
[0:38:15] eielwind: lol
[0:38:20] Ujai321: Is that a sore spot for you?
[0:38:23] cashthb: wasn't glad 2700?
[0:38:28] BakerMcGeez: I last seriously did PVP in Cata
[0:38:30] themaykr_: Aware
[0:38:49] Ujai321: Was it at least good for the stream?
[0:39:11] themaykr_: playing warframe and watching you on second screen, fun times
[0:39:12] Perkolate: 40-60 i think
[0:39:18] Greevers: was it YouTube sreaming back in WoD?
[0:39:24] Ujai321: You were not quite the popstar you are today
[0:39:28] Greevers: streaming*
[0:39:35] Kurama__95: Would doing LFR for the helm enchant be worth for PvP? Û†ÄÄ
[0:39:38] Daemavand: Which has me curious. At what point did your stream start to grow notably?
[0:39:43] DrQuinteros_ElDragons: DrQuinteros_ElDragons subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Hi hazel
[0:39:43] Streamlabs: drquinteros_eldragons just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:40:05] Daemavand: Interesting!
[0:40:36] Ujai321: You also had subs on YouTube from your day job
[0:40:41] jeffdmk: you can stream to both now
[0:40:58] Vivica_x0: Any predicitions on when they will make all classes playable on any race
[0:41:15] Ujai321: Imagine if you were not talking to chat
[0:41:16] Greevers: what is lovely abput your streams is we can chat
[0:41:21] Daemavand: yeeeeeeeah
[0:41:27] elliongrey: Any predictions on when they might allow me to play undead on alliance? :D
[0:41:33] Zuldak: reminds me of the days of multiple chat services like aim vs msn vs yahoo
[0:41:33] LilyOfTremere: I first watched you on the YT streams, and was sad when you moved to Twitch as I never used it x)
[0:41:37] Lewbra: has trying different things to grow the stream lessened your enjoyment of the game at all?
[0:41:49] Ujai321: This one maybe not, but you know which one would?
[0:41:57] Ujai321: Hazel after dark.
[0:42:58] medvet03: @elliongrey You can sort of do that now, if you use the undead skin for Night Elves or Void Elves. I know it isn't the same, but useful for RP, I guess. :D
[0:43:03] cashthb: do a hyjal summit!
[0:43:22] amaya21: true
[0:43:29] Samordorak: I have fun vicariously through you lol
[0:43:29] elliongrey: @medvet03 undead skin, you say?! I will look this up! Ty! :)
[0:43:32] Ujai321: Case in point: I could not watch the Stray stream
[0:43:38] themaykr_: playing warframe and watching you on second screen, def having fun
[0:44:18] jeffdmk: I thought the reason to watch the stream so to get annoyed when you get a mount that i wish i had
[0:44:20] amaya21: will it apply to legion legendary weapons?
[0:45:04] MajGhostPants: From what I understand you get the drop put it in the shared bank then take it out on the class and learn it. That is how I understand it from all the interviews and such
[0:45:28] Daemavand: Birds in generally are awesome imo :D
[0:45:32] amaya21: yeah it is amazing
[0:45:33] Zuldak: FYI most class hall mounts have 3 colorations
[0:45:34] cashthb: sad to say but I have to agree
[0:45:35] Daemavand: Yeah its nice!
[0:45:37] Kurama__95: I had a spreadsheet for target transmog farming and was putting it to work for 3 weeks, then TWW announced the new transmog feature and it all went down the drain LUL
[0:45:58] rangergreyson: not all
[0:45:59] GreenArrowed: not all of them
[0:45:59] Zuldak: no the monk one does not
[0:46:01] sence_00: no monk is just the one form
[0:46:05] rangergreyson: monk doesnt
[0:46:07] mishato: nah the monk doesnt but ya u get the snark lol
[0:46:15] mcxoney: paladin has 4 tho
[0:46:17] Daemavand: Speaking of birds, I was watching a VOD last night, and I wonder
[0:46:22] Gaming_Mama56: Hey Hazel.. you live in BC right? Hello from Whidbey Island sharing this chilly weather.
[0:46:22] Daemavand: Is there an uipdate on the hummingbirds
[0:46:23] GreenArrowed: i think warrior is just one, or i only got 1
[0:46:24] Zuldak: the druid class hall form color is based on your race
[0:46:25] sence_00: I guess most of them do, although I think Hunter you can choose which one you ride it isnt spec-specific
[0:46:26] Ujai321: Who cares, the monk one is mean to me, I love it even if it has 1 color
[0:46:30] GreenArrowed: buy them
[0:46:32] Kurama__95: Some order hall mounts change tints according to your spec, others are just different mounts with different tints
[0:46:35] Zuldak: you have to buy them with resources iirc
[0:46:35] GreenArrowed: shaman is spec specific
[0:46:38] sence_00: some of them are different mounts
[0:46:47] sence_00: Warlock and Hunter are different I think, maybe Pally
[0:46:50] Zuldak: yeah the mage one changes based on spec too
[0:46:54] iamtheolesen: Hunter is 3 different mounts
[0:46:54] medvet03: @Ujai321 Of course! You have to unlock the look, but it is easy. You have to do the scenario to restore the Under City area for the Forsaken (sort of). At the end of it, you meet some of the new undead Elves and see the creation of the Desolate Council. I can't recall which NPC you have to talk to start it, but they will be in SW. I did the Horde scenario, so I spoke with Calia in Org.
[0:46:55] amaya21: shaman's elemental was nice too
[0:47:00] fisherreads: hunter ones I had to buy the other colors
[0:47:01] MajGhostPants: Druids doesn't count as a mount lol
[0:47:01] Samordorak: I think rogue is also different mounts
[0:47:06] Kurama__95: Rogue, for example has 2 other tints that you just buy with order resources
[0:47:10] pinkcrabstick: Yeah warlock are def 3 diff mounts
[0:47:25] Vivica_x0: Have you gotten the 10.2 druid forms?
[0:47:37] jgbrit: I had the paladin ones on my account but I can't remember if I got them all at once
[0:47:39] wolfcloudchaser80: The druid lunarwing is so derpy.
[0:47:59] cashthb: not even 98
[0:48:00] wolfcloudchaser80: The new Emerald Dream owl is incredible, however.
[0:48:08] Ujai321: HaZOOlnuttygames
[0:48:09] Kurama__95: 97% parse on pet collection EZ
[0:48:19] tildo03: what mod is that for your pets
[0:48:36] tildo03: oh that is armory
[0:48:38] LKatey75: hello all! Hope you've warmed up some
[0:49:26] Shortngeek: isn‚Äôt Druid just a flight form not a mount
[0:49:52] Kurama__95: I think the druid flight form can also carry a friend
[0:49:56] MischiefMunchy: The purple warlock mount is awesome but you have to spawn camp a dude in the broken shore to kill it and get it.
[0:49:57] jgbrit: The time rift ones are probably more time sensitive
[0:50:02] GreenArrowed: yea
[0:50:04] GreenArrowed: some
[0:50:05] sence_00: the extras are bought with Order Resources ya
[0:50:06] GreenArrowed: some are drops
[0:50:07] cashthb: 2000 ea
[0:50:13] sence_00: and the Pally ones are expensive i think
[0:50:23] nadiaaa: purple warlock horse drops from a wq boss i think
[0:50:25] Kurama__95: Most yes, I know the warlock one is a 100% drop from a rare in the Broken Shore

[0:50:28] Streamlabs: meromehughes just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:50:29] sence_00: isnt only Warlock a drop?
[0:50:49] Zuldak: yeah warlock is a special case, its a drop

[0:51:29] themaykr_: Fatty D:
[0:51:49] Gaming_Mama56: it's 14f here on whidbey
[0:51:58] vikutoru11: Hi, Hazel! Did you like the new "tree" dragon mount?
[0:52:10] fisherreads: it‚Äôs -11F here. not going outside at all today
[0:52:40] Anastalock: It was -47C here in Calgary, when the windchill was factored in.
[0:52:46] Daemavand: There are some parts of my life I miss whilst I was living in Calgary, but the -40¬∞C business is not one of them
[0:53:07] Darknexr: well you cant retire if you dead
[0:53:08] CondorWow: it doubles as a golf club
[0:53:10] des_olation: retires the defect from life
[0:53:10] cashthb: you could do the chromie daily quest on the blonze place to guarantee a drop
[0:53:11] wolfcloudchaser80: It "retires" defects
[0:53:12] heldtheline: I think they mean 'retirement' in the unalive sense.
[0:53:15] sence_00: ya Im currently doing an Ember Court and its not the most fun to go back for
[0:53:22] dvkJoe: It retires the enemies, permanently!
[0:53:28] LKatey75: yeah, that's cold
[0:53:35] Kurama__95: On the first week of Time Rifts, the guarantee drop buff bugged out on one of my characters and would give me a drop everytime I did it, so I spammed as much as I could before they fixed it LUL
[0:53:47] reallyaceryl: All the fel related items matter most to me lol
[0:54:02] Vivica_x0: Yay I got the flame hearthstone from LFR. The different types of hearthstones is one of my favorite modern day wow additions
[0:54:07] dagoxd1986: eons fridge theres a daily quest
[0:54:07] jgbrit: Have you got an encapsulated destiny?
[0:54:33] Tekk4713: find a custom group for time rifts and its far better
[0:54:40] dagoxd1986: south
[0:54:47] Jobbyjob: join the custom group for time rifts
[0:54:49] sence_00: over closer to the Temporal Conflux
[0:54:49] Kurama__95: I did way more Time Rifts that I wished chasing the warlock pet customizations
[0:55:02] Jobbyjob: "time rift" search that
[0:55:03] chefdejour82: think you can transfer the currency to different charcter 1 for 1
[0:55:10] Ujai321: Joining a group is cheating, I agree
[0:55:29] cashthb: the inn in the mountain at the bronze stone place, it takes like 5 minute, you could technically do it before the boss
[0:55:36] Perkolate: speaking of groups, where the heck are the TW raid groups. wonder if they all happen at the start of the week.
[0:56:06] Daemavand: Can confirm have never done a TWing raid in my life
[0:56:25] jeffdmk: you think you can solo the final boss?
[0:56:27] Ujai321: I did one once
[0:56:36] jgbrit: 52.34 78.56 eons fringe
[0:56:38] Zuldak: yeah the TW raids are fun
[0:56:55] Daemavand: Its probably good but IDK why, I just can't be arsed
[0:56:57] Perkolate: yeah apparently the cache has like an increased chance to drop one of the mounts from the xpac
[0:56:57] Kurama__95: I did Black Temple TW once for the Warglaives transmog LUL
[0:56:58] Zuldak: i wanna know what the time running thing was
[0:57:01] Daemavand: Just no interest lol
[0:57:26] Perkolate: I know entr got ashes from the TBC raid box last week
[0:57:31] Perkolate: not last week, but last time
[0:57:33] cashthb: but what if it will give you the *Illidan mount*
[0:57:43] Ujai321: it is hard to incentivise tw raid imo
[0:57:44] averageteacup: I had bad experience with TW, few very rude players and i never went back
[0:58:03] For_Real_Real: i have gotten the enchanting crest forumlas from superbloom
[0:58:07] InakaUk: I just don't have the time. There is far to much for me to do in game for my limited time to play
[0:58:13] jgbrit: Timewalking is definitely more toxic
[0:58:25] heldtheline: I want an Illidan mount which is Illidan giving me a piggyback ride.
[0:58:35] cashthb: maybe he does but noone has it yet, if you don't do it will never drop dor sure
[0:58:38] Jobbyjob: do you do arena for the Vicious mount each season?
[0:58:42] Zuldak: you mean time walking dungeons @jgbrit ?
[0:58:54] Zuldak: cause the tw dungeons can be uhh... go go go
[0:59:05] Jobbyjob: i hate how solo shuffle you have to get 3 wins, or you get no %
[0:59:14] jgbrit: @zuldak yep.
[0:59:30] Ujai321: Illidan would be a fun mount. You could grab the horns OR in front of his eyes. He doesn't mind, he's blind anyway. Never get lost again!
[1:00:15] nyrhalahotep: @Ujai321 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[1:00:19] Jobbyjob: I won 2, then someone left so i got no %, annoying
[1:00:23] nyrhalahotep: I'M DYING üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[1:00:40] Zuldak: I like when he yells 'I am mice cars'
[1:00:55] Ujai321: He seems like the kind of guy who wouldn't give you a piggy back ride in the first place, no matter how good friends you are
[1:01:06] cashthb: honestly, games get faster on higher rating in my experience - well I mean after you pass the point where you can get a kill on a healer
[1:01:08] Ujai321: Du you think velen got one? Absolutely not!
[1:01:21] For_Real_Real: doing warlock things - twinkle is a beast....
[1:01:28] Jobbyjob: This is my first time doing arena for mounts, but i don't think i have it in me to fill the bar multiple times for the old vicious mounts
[1:01:52] Zuldak: ya know how players are champions of azeroth? I find it a bit odd because orcs, dranei and others arent actually from azeroth
[1:02:28] gottacatsupemall: yolo RBGs grind the saddles pretty fast
[1:02:41] Zuldak: or children of azeroth...
[1:02:53] Zuldak: in guess they are the adopted children
[1:03:24] Zuldak: evokers are experimented on dragons
[1:03:44] Trikloo: you can just click randomly and it works i think
[1:03:48] crystalsing3r: That one is kind of a pain.
[1:04:08] Zuldak: oh this one absolutly slaps lol
[1:04:11] Zuldak: or it used to
[1:04:49] dvkJoe: Do not use grenades!
[1:05:40] cashthb: use it on the lichking!
[1:05:51] cashthb: no sl
[1:07:31] msmester1: Hello :D just hit 70 today im so lost with all the quests LUL
[1:07:41] jgbrit: 52.34 78.56 eons fringe
[1:07:48] cashthb: it was added with time rifts, that area threw you out prior to that
[1:08:39] msmester1: im back to fighting with quest number limit, hard to restist the yellow !
[1:08:44] jgbrit: Does the search term 'time rift' work in the mount search box?
[1:08:51] cashthb: no, she has random guests
[1:09:14] msmester1: ü™ë stream
[1:09:46] msmester1: CoolCat stream my bad
[1:11:33] themaykr_: muted
[1:11:59] Octopixy1971: hazelShiny hazelLove
[1:12:03] medvet03: @msmester1 If it's your first 70, you should do the Ebbysian/Emberthal intro first where you go to the Forbidden Reach. Then you will do the scenario that leads to the Zaralek Cavern. After that, I would then jump into the Emerald Dream content. Otherwise, just jump into the ED stuff. :)
[1:12:21] Magellan_76: awwe, lil kitty <3
[1:12:44] msmester1: @msmester1 yeah im planning on doing that its just confusing wich quest line is wich, thx
[1:13:31] medvet03: I know, WOW is still bad about that. You see so many Exclamations on your map, so it can be very confusing.
[1:13:34] dvkJoe: That Transmog is awesome!
[1:13:45] Molly336: @msmester1 May i suggest BTWQuests? It so good to see where you are at in the story etc
[1:13:50] Molly336: Its an addon
[1:14:02] medvet03: I love the Gnome heritage armor. I have it on mine.
[1:14:03] msmester1: @msmester1 oh might check that one out
[1:14:05] Teptrum: Teptrum subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[1:14:06] Streamlabs: teptrum just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:14:32] dvkJoe: No you dont!
[1:14:51] msmester1: i still have my insignia for class hall in my bag LUL
[1:14:51] Zuldak: yeah i dont think y ou need to, you do need access to the broken shore though
[1:14:52] mariemo55: will you participate in the drop on tuesday 16th for the patch 10.2.5
[1:15:01] dvkJoe: You just have to do the quest that gets you there
[1:15:09] Zuldak: @mariemo55 no because they changed it to be on the 23rd
[1:15:09] Rago602: you have to go in the shops that have raven's on the signs
[1:15:13] heldtheline: The shops with ravens on the signs.
[1:15:15] Molly336: @medvet03  you can also get it for previous expansion. I used it a lot for Legion since i started end of BFA so i had no clue what to do :)
[1:15:21] LKatey75: Rogue was the only one I didnt' get the class mount on
[1:15:27] crystalsing3r: ***
[1:15:35] heldtheline: Up in the city.
[1:15:36] mariemo55: the patch is pushed righrt ... I tought so because the ptr suffered delays
[1:15:40] msmester1: its not in the underbelly
[1:15:42] Kurama__95: The cheese and wine vendor upstairs
[1:15:45] Rago602: its in dalaran, not underbelly :p
[1:15:45] Zuldak: so i always went to the wine and cheese shop in dalaran and talked to the guy
[1:15:48] Stormcrone: it's upstairs
[1:15:50] Zuldak: for the rogue hall
[1:15:57] medvet03: For rogues, make sure you have your token (I can't recall what it is called), then just walk into a shop that has a Raven above the shop and talk to the NPC to get into the order hall.
[1:16:01] Zuldak: there are multiple ways into the rogue class hall
[1:16:14] Andikkarm: need to enter from a shop in Dalaran
[1:16:22] ryguy2133: its so different from playing sod and classic compared to watching you play retail
[1:16:24] Zuldak: i dont know the underbelly way. Go to the wine and cheese shop and talk to the shop owner
[1:16:24] Stormcrone: it's a secret door
[1:16:28] Mugenhyo: fountain  shop
[1:16:37] averageteacup: Legion was the most fun expansion for me :D
[1:16:41] Mugenhyo: its a secret door
[1:16:47] Mugenhyo: upstairs
[1:16:47] Kurama__95: There's no underbelly way, I believe LUL
[1:16:48] jgbrit: That was the paladin one funnily enough
[1:17:01] ghostie1995: i thought they were door knockers?
[1:17:06] goplacidly56: yeah its an outside entrance
[1:17:14] medvet03: @averageteacup Agreed. I still lvl many of my alts through it.
[1:17:40] Maggaeri: the rogue one is through the shop near the alliance bank, after you talk to the npc there and then go through the secret door on the left
[1:17:42] Mugenhyo: no no go to bank
[1:17:53] Stormcrone: it's the outflow pipe we all try falling from
[1:17:54] msmester1: Uncrowned Insignia do you have it?
[1:17:58] Mugenhyo: ok ok thats another way
[1:18:12] goplacidly56: its on the other side
[1:18:13] diyreality: wasn't there a shortcut from a shop near the pond?
[1:18:22] Maggaeri: I also think that you can get there from the underbelly, but I can't remember where, seems like it was through the one tunnel, where if you aren't a rogue you fall through the floating island and fall to your death
[1:18:24] azrazil720: As long as you're having fun, that's what matters! that's what we're here for :)
[1:18:53] msmester1: Wait wowhead says i dont need the insigia to enter -1 bagspace for years LUL
[1:18:53] Maggaeri: and there it is
[1:18:54] Zuldak: yeah thats one way in
[1:19:08] medvet03: Awesome! I didn't know about that pipe!
[1:19:09] sence_00: wait the normal dude wouldnt let you in?
[1:19:23] msmester1: im a vulpera its ok EZ
[1:19:31] ghostie1995: that pipe is funny because if youre a vulpera you can set up camp at the very edge, seeing the caravan bug out is hilarious
[1:19:40] Cooperharley0204: your UI is awesome
[1:19:41] Kurama__95: The Power Within is the Balance of Power questline, can scrap it
[1:19:53] Synkronos: @sence_00 The dude would have, Hazel just wanted to go in the difficult way, by choice
[1:20:06] crystalsing3r: You've inspired me. I need to do more of the class mount quests. I have some of them, but not all of them.
[1:20:20] sence_00: @Synkronos oh.....
[1:20:25] msmester1: i did it like 1 week before they changed it peepoSad
[1:20:41] medvet03: Sadly, I don't think it is account wide. I think each toon has to do the steps to unlock the mount quest. But I am not certain on that.
[1:21:08] treyski31: Happy Saturday, Hazel! Hope you're staying warm!!
[1:21:10] InakaUk: Do the class hall mounts count toward total mount achievements?
[1:21:35] cashthb: no
[1:21:38] Arabany: I miss gnomes so much:/ They are so cute. But here are no horde gnomes.
[1:21:39] sence_00: I dont think you need all 3 but maybe
[1:21:45] Kurama__95: I did the Order Hall mounts post change, but quite a long itme ago. From what I remember, you need to complete the Order Hall campaign and do some of Broken Shore, up to unlocking your last follower, then the mount quest unlocks
[1:21:58] medvet03: From what I have learned is that you have to do the Legionfall campaign and then the quest will unlock. At least, from what I have personally discovered, but I can't recall the source.
[1:21:59] msmester1: i mean might just get the dreadblades they look really nice
[1:22:02] xerxesgirl: I actually have all the class mounts for all the classes but it took a long time
[1:22:15] traktordestrucktor: there are super helpfull giudes on YT  that will tell you where to go and how to get the quest
[1:22:18] Zhenedra: hazelWave
[1:22:18] ghostie1995: i imagine them sitting there with the quest waiting for her for who know how long lol
[1:22:21] traktordestrucktor: might be on the broken isle
[1:22:27] diyreality: did they change something or it is your hunt for the day?
[1:22:49] msmester1: only sell the stuff not use them respect LUL
[1:22:53] cashthb: well.... you could go to the broken shore and check out if the tomb quests are available
[1:22:56] diyreality: order halls changes for the mount, sorry i am cryptic
[1:23:13] Maggaeri: you do have to do the full legionfall campaign to unlock the class mounts.   I just had to do it on several classes a few months ago to get them
[1:23:24] traktordestrucktor: i think  lots of the mount quest starts at The Broken shore camp
[1:23:35] dvkJoe: Cann you look if you have a quest called Champions of Legionfall available on the broken shore?
[1:23:36] Maggaeri: I had them on several classes was trying to finish the rest
[1:23:55] jgbrit: Is it anything to do with the quests where the violet citadel is? I think you need to speak to khadgar
[1:23:56] Kurama__95: @Maggaeri You don't need to do it to it's fullest. Once you did it all on one character, the rest only needs to unlock the last follower for the mount quest to unlock
[1:23:56] ghostie1995: solid plan, ADVENTURE
[1:23:59] diyreality: i see so it is your hunt for the day :), i joined later in the stream, been lurking for a bit
[1:24:12] wolfcloudchaser80: I think this is kinda mysterious as far as completing in modern WoW, so don't feel singled out.
[1:24:22] sence_00: if yuu did the whole campaign already then the mount quest starts on the broken shore
[1:24:30] Kurama__95: @HazelNuttyGames Check your followers in the mission table, see if you have them all
[1:24:38] jgbrit: Is it anything to do with the quests where the violet citadel is? I think you need to speak to khadgar
[1:24:42] sylviewindrunner: Dread Infiltrators is the quest you need!!!!!!
[1:25:13] Vivica_x0: Aquire your legionfall champion. This quest is found on the broken shore near the mage tower. It gives you a sixth companion.
[1:25:31] sylviewindrunner: The Broken Shore!!!!! Dread Infiltrators Quest is available!!!!!
[1:25:33] treyski31: What's your favorite kind of pancake?
[1:25:37] msmester1: next time i would recommend the wow team to mark the 3 main questlines with different colors
[1:25:45] jgbrit: Ooff that was a swift delete, good job mods
[1:25:54] treyski31: Oooooo...that's actually great answer!!
[1:26:08] treyski31: #Waffles4Ever
[1:26:14] Atomicpanda: just make them for decoration.
[1:26:15] ScriptedDialog: Waffle surperiority squad
[1:26:23] johnsbits: You should sell pancakes!
[1:26:35] Synkronos: Waffles have more crispy surface, the ratio is better
[1:26:37] Atomicpanda: waffles have syrup holes
[1:26:47] wolfcloudchaser80: As Mitch Hedberg said, waffles are just pancakes with a syrup trap.
[1:26:47] LilyOfTremere: I'm the complete opposite :D I love waffles and pancakes and crepes, but absolutely hate making them x)
[1:27:12] Atomicpanda: waffles are the superior butter and syrup delivery system.
[1:27:26] sence_00: it would be a Rogue giving you the Mount Quest
[1:27:34] msmester1: LUL
[1:27:34] averageteacup: now i want crepe cake
[1:27:41] steve_mcyeet: Why do you play with all nameplates off?
[1:27:44] Zuldak: buzzard
[1:27:54] diyreality: i guess we need an auto-pilot like add-on for order halls/legendary skin
[1:28:13] Zuldak: so you like the sewer pipe enterence?
[1:28:22] msmester1: i want that bird so bad but i dont have patiance farming mounts peepoSad
[1:28:44] Terra___l: there is an post on the class mount guide with what have to be done to get them i can provide an link if wanted
[1:29:00] Kurama__95: There's a vulture for the 8.3 Uldum rep (Uldum Accord), you get rep and buy it
[1:29:01] haarrrv: what mount journal addon is that
[1:29:04] sence_00: the shop beside the fishing fountain
[1:29:09] Zuldak: talk to the guy behind counter
[1:29:22] Zuldak: then you cna open door
[1:29:40] sence_00: to the right
[1:29:46] medvet03: To the right
[1:29:49] msmester1: where you pull the torch
[1:29:51] Stormcrone: map on the wall?
[1:29:53] heldtheline: it's hanging on the wall, i think
[1:30:03] nyrhalahotep: noy there hahaha splash
[1:30:04] sence_00: the NPC is named Nikki i think
[1:30:26] Stormcrone: more to the right I think
[1:30:34] sence_00: not in the vault, just right of there
[1:30:39] treyski31: When chat starts giving "right and left" directions, I start getting anxious lol
[1:30:54] sknude: Can't remember but do you need to do quest for each spec to get all four mounts?
[1:31:17] Zuldak: oh i had no idea you had that much of a chat delay
[1:31:21] cashthb: he better be cozy... that's pretty much my gold he's sitting on
[1:31:29] wolfcloudchaser80: "Turn left one block ago"
[1:31:36] msmester1: we need to preditct you and give insructions to the future EZ
[1:31:39] medvet03: lol, no worries. Luckily the order hall isn't too big of an area. :D
[1:31:56] treyski31: Speaking of mission tables, sometimes I miss the TLDR Shadowland days when we were raking in the raw gold :)
[1:31:57] diyreality: recalibrating
[1:32:01] Atomicpanda: in 1000 feet turn right
[1:32:04] Zuldak: yeah
[1:32:05] Kurama__95: LUL
[1:32:13] sence_00: yah! If you have done the campaign its just the NPC from the Broken Shore
[1:32:14] Zuldak: a lot of them are short
[1:32:14] nyrhalahotep: OMG hahahaha
[1:32:17] Stormcrone: lol
[1:32:22] cashthb: you also have to listen for some rp
[1:32:25] Zuldak: its a reward for unlocking broken shore
[1:32:31] jgbrit: What? How?
[1:32:39] nyrhalahotep: Your exasperation is understandable.
[1:32:43] Terra___l: didnt had the rouge more then one tint for the mount?
[1:32:44] Atomicpanda: i guess i should get the class hall mounts i'm missing
[1:32:49] LilyOfTremere: I wish the mount could be used on all chars and not just rogues. It's so nice <3
[1:32:53] wolfcloudchaser80: Well... I just yesterday finally bought the rest of the human racial mounts. Some of us are just fashionable late.
[1:33:06] Zuldak: it became this easy when argus was added and they put in a broken shore skip
[1:33:17] msmester1: doing the broken shore each time killed my mood peepoSad
[1:33:26] jgbrit: I remember having to do breaching the tomb and a butt tonne of quests on my paladin

[1:35:01] dvkJoe: Yes
[1:35:11] LilyOfTremere: Oh does it want you to fly from the Quel Thalas or whatever the PvP place
[1:35:15] Kurama__95: You could use your pet battle portal to Stratholme -> Ghostlands -> Silvermoon
[1:35:16] cashthb: that's what you get when you don't invite a mage to your order hall
[1:35:42] dvkJoe: That effed up wayfining ai made me read questtexts more, couse of exactly that!
[1:35:58] Kurama__95: savixKEKW
[1:36:01] LilyOfTremere: Oh, right.. Sorry xD
[1:36:02] msmester1: LUL
[1:36:11] jgbrit: So are the ghost lands lol
[1:36:18] Kurama__95: There's a flightpath to Ghostlands
[1:36:26] tideffect: there should be a ZA flight path
[1:36:28] cashthb: a skilled assasin could have killed him from shattrath
[1:36:36] alisoninaisle10: i heard that they will redo isles

[1:37:47] Kurama__95: The vicious mechanostrider is PogChamp
[1:37:51] sence_00: ratsatallion is easy if you do it in Chromie Time
[1:37:52] blissy416: this place might get a revamp in midnight
[1:37:54] msmester1: use a mechagon one 4Head
[1:38:03] cashthb: azuremyst is literally one of the best zones in every aspect
[1:38:06] Hell_FALKON: hey Hazel, did you get any first looks to theWarWithin?
[1:38:09] averageteacup: fearsome assassin and her donkey!
[1:38:12] catechism__: mine is 'swift horde wolf'
[1:38:16] alisoninaisle10: i swear it wasnt a fever dream and ion said that they want to connect them to the rest of the continents
[1:38:20] catechism__: from hardmode TOC bc it's not in the game anymore
[1:38:39] heldtheline: the white hawkstrider would establish dominance
[1:38:39] sm00kie2: unless I go there to hunt Easter eggs, very little reason to go to the Draenei places for me
[1:38:52] alisoninaisle10: hazelWave also hello hazel and hazel enjoyers
[1:39:00] jgbrit: Did you buy or farm your Razzashi Hatchling pet?

[1:39:31] alisoninaisle10: dont even get me started on the maw either
[1:39:34] Kurama__95: They said we're going back to Northrend in the Worldsoul Saga and there was something about Quel'thalas, so we're probably getting the map revamped on old areas
[1:39:35] Atomicpanda: hazel is the weather nuts where you are too? stupid cold here in oregon
[1:39:35] random_redshirt: Ion and Morgan said something in an interview (maybe with T&E?) about wanting to be able to fly north from the Plaguelands and not have a zone-load screen, I think as part of the Midnight updates
[1:39:42] ghostie1995: Azuremyst isles gives me nostalgia because i started there as a draenai back in 8.3
[1:39:54] ladyofrohan920: 50 mile winds where I am today.
[1:39:54] Zuldak: it is 15 F

[1:41:43] medvet03: Ooh, yummy!
[1:41:43] cashthb: it sounds like a great weather for running, no ice to fall on, but cold enough to also train your spirit
[1:41:43] Ryok: still upset they were the only raid meta achievement mounts that were ever removed D:
[1:42:00] jgbrit: So tomorrow we have a low of -4 and next Monday +10 LUL
[1:42:05] treyski31: Sounds delicious!

[1:42:34] LKatey75: I think we're warming up to snow tomorrow
[1:42:49] LKatey75: maybe 10 f now I haven't checked
[1:42:51] diyreality: could it be the author couldn't himself do them properly haha
[1:42:51] msmester1: why cant you fly here?
[1:43:17] Zuldak: technically they are the oldest zones in retail
[1:43:19] witchhobbit: last weekend we had snow and today it's 58 degrees
[1:43:28] tideffect: would be so nice to have dragon riding there üòÉ
[1:43:39] medvet03: Same with the Draenei starting area, you can't fly there either.
[1:43:56] diyreality: is she french?
[1:44:07] Atomicpanda: bet she made a lot of bread off those books
[1:44:18] cashthb: I like them, make them for me!
[1:44:23] diyreality: i know the French are crazy about fresh baked stuff
[1:44:24] crystalsing3r: @haleych similar here. 54 today.
[1:44:27] amaya21: i love muffins with choco bits inside
[1:44:33] nyrhalahotep: never knew how diverse simply making bread to be, just made Palestinian flatbread last week, "Taboon," absolutely DELECTABLE. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
[1:44:33] averageteacup: make cup cakes? :D
[1:44:34] witchhobbit: muffins are so good
[1:44:35] Daemavand: Maybe you want to make muffins so that you can share with others?
[1:44:35] Skrewtaype: I'm intrigued. Why don't we like muffins?
[1:44:36] Atomicpanda: you can make savory muffins.
[1:44:37] msmester1: i mean it depends thera are so many differnt muffins
[1:44:37] jgbrit: What? Blueberry muffins are BIS
[1:44:41] Daemavand: Tis the joy of baking :D

[1:45:13] lortnokgamer: Hi Hazel
[1:45:15] cashthb: add some salmon
[1:45:15] NolaDoja: Muffin tins equally good for cupcakes
[1:45:29] Daemavand: I just bought a fresh walnut and pistachio loaf earlier and I'm restraining myself from not eating the entire thing
[1:45:41] nyrhalahotep: the secret to healthy bread is using real flour, do everything you can to avoid American super processed because they pull out all the nutrients.
[1:45:50] Skrewtaype: Fair enough. I like a good savory bread too. I love things with sun dried tomato.
[1:46:10] Skrewtaype: mmmmmmmm
[1:46:11] greshnik__666: sundried tomato on salad is so nice
[1:46:13] johnsbits: Sun dried tomato muffins!
[1:46:26] Daemavand: Have you tried putting things like fruit/veg/nuts/etc into your breadmaking recipies yet? Maybe I missed that discussion already
[1:46:27] witchhobbit: i love rosemary salt bread/bagels
[1:46:29] gold9871: use distract on the robot
[1:46:31] cashthb: just shoot him
[1:46:39] jgbrit: It's players that are your problem
[1:47:06] cashthb: wait for the next patch and port gilneas
[1:47:18] heldtheline: I wonder if Alliance can use the transporter in Silvermoon to get to UC
[1:47:33] LilyOfTremere: Can't Alliance click on the portal in Silvermoon to UC? :o
[1:47:38] random_redshirt: soft pretzels are fun for savory snacks
[1:47:40] witchhobbit: omg yeah, trader joe's makes pizza dough with garlic and herb, it's the best
[1:47:40] Snacktooth: walnut bread, branch out :)
[1:47:45] helheimr: @heldtheline they can, Ive killed the queen using that
[1:47:51] msmester1: all enemy cites YEP
[1:47:58] gentlecatzz: What mount is that?
[1:48:00] russtrotter: man, all depressed now, just finished taking last of christmas lights and decorations.. only like 310 shopping days until next year
[1:48:16] gentlecatzz: Looks so silly
[1:48:19] FrilleJr: this quest made me realize why the ah npc got killed a lot back in legion
[1:48:26] msmester1: silly goose
[1:48:30] cashthb: well the whole story is about Mathias Shaw being replaced by a Dreadlord, would be pretty weird on the horde side without going into enemy cities
[1:48:38] witchhobbit: can you get the for the alliance/horde achievement solo?
[1:48:39] jgbrit: It reminds me of the hallows end achievements that send you so opposing cities for candy buckets
[1:48:39] LKatey75: the whole going to enemy cities is why I never did the rogue mount
[1:48:49] majortusk: seagulls are beach eagles :)
[1:49:06] Atomicpanda: since i'm snowed in i finally got my pirate vulpera to 70.
[1:49:11] averageteacup: I love this zone, spent so much time here
[1:49:13] cashthb: @haleych no way no how... well okay, maybe on a tank but I doubt it
[1:49:21] IAmScarlett__: hi hello
[1:49:32] IAmScarlett__: ur mentally ill british woman has arrived
[1:49:35] witchhobbit: @cashthb yeah, it all scales doesn't it?

[1:50:13] IAmScarlett__: whaaaaaaaat are you doing today
[1:50:21] wolfcloudchaser80: Hey, I'm flying over England now in MSFS!

[1:50:34] msmester1: you have to change back undecity in time
[1:50:36] cashthb: @haleych yup, btw I'd recommend the alliance, there were only 2 horde leaders alive & working in sl, dunno if they updated it
[1:50:51] Kurama__95: @HazelNuttyGames Is the Whelptender title account-wide?
[1:50:56] Althanar157: you are
[1:51:07] witchhobbit: @Kurama__95 noo :(
[1:51:07] Zuldak: yes current timeline would be impossible to enter
[1:51:27] witchhobbit: you can only get it on the toon you did the achievement on atm
[1:51:41] Kurama__95: Alright, my idea to park an alt to do just whelp daycare is ruined LUL
[1:51:53] witchhobbit: i started doing the whelp daycare again but gave up lol
[1:51:59] Im_CeJota: <3
[1:52:02] witchhobbit: yeah hopefully with the war within change
[1:52:08] msmester1: why spend time in uc ?
[1:52:28] witchhobbit: @cashthb makes sense
[1:52:29] Zuldak: i am happy they fixed a lot of the vulpera helms to no longer have their nose clip through
[1:52:56] badfo: oh man this questline bothered a lot of people in legion due to the pvp flagging
[1:53:02] Atomicpanda: never forgetting my vulpera's imp. pizpad. lol
[1:53:22] jack_fraust: I wish Vulpera would have been Ali
[1:53:24] Althanar157: you were right at first
[1:53:25] shaycwe: Who wins, lion or bear
[1:53:46] Myhtologist: Guardssss :D
[1:53:49] traktordestrucktor: you can have vulp, we horde dont want them
[1:54:00] Myhtologist: :D
[1:54:02] jack_fraust: lolollolol
[1:54:06] cashthb: @shaycwe what kind of bear?
[1:54:08] IAmScarlett__: i was playing league yesterday and someone asked why my name was and it literally was my tag
[1:54:23] jack_fraust: well give you the dark iron dwarves
[1:54:24] shaycwe: @cashthb black bear
[1:54:44] Kurama__95: Time to spec Sublety for the 2nd Vanish charge Kappa
[1:54:44] Myhtologist: kill it :D np
[1:54:58] cashthb: @shaycwe prolly the lion I think
[1:55:03] IAmScarlett__: hazel says she cant kill it
[1:55:05] IAmScarlett__: yet kills it
[1:55:15] Zuldak: dropped combat
[1:55:34] MagicPants1414: you played SoD??
[1:56:04] assbarf: rip lol
[1:56:27] amaya21: that's how most stealth games go
[1:56:46] jack_fraust: at least you tried
[1:56:56] msmester1: rez sickess is only 1 minute didnt even know
[1:56:56] For_Real_Real: ring of kirin tor
[1:57:12] jgbrit: Sw > uldum
[1:57:20] Smartaxe: just write down
[1:57:30] jgbrit: Uldum!
[1:57:32] cashthb: it would be so much faster to just ask a mage for portal
[1:57:41] Sassyshott: just go to BFA place and hit the silithus  portal and fly up
[1:57:47] jack_fraust: then caverns
[1:57:56] jack_fraust: thern caverns
[1:58:00] Cyberwolffe: Whdy not fly from stormwind to booty bay and take the boat to ratchet and fly from there?
[1:58:01] Daemavand: I believe!!
[1:58:24] Darknexr: wait
[1:58:27] bitshady: wouldnt it been easier to go dalaran, pet store, wailing caverns?
[1:58:27] jack_fraust: OH SNAP!!!
[1:58:29] Darknexr: that was a thing?
[1:58:34] LilyOfTremere: Nice :D
[1:58:38] jack_fraust: ty for that secret port
[1:58:40] Blatsphemare: dal poral on CD?
[1:58:44] msmester1: this is the time when you really realize how big WOW is now
[1:58:48] IAmScarlett__: what happejned to the pink mug
[1:58:55] Tragicarp: Watch out for flying guards around TB and Org.
[1:58:57] crystalsing3r: I never knew about that.
[1:59:13] Synkronos: From Zuldazar for Horde :)
[1:59:14] jack_fraust: @ pet battles - UHHHHH
[1:59:24] bitshady: ah gotcha
[1:59:26] Darknexr: fall dmg does not break stealth if i remember right
[1:59:31] cashthb: now that you're here: I would have just taken the baloon from uc
[1:59:46] bitshady: I enjoy these non m+ streams
[2:00:12] jgbrit: Ooff orgrimmar? That'll suck
[2:00:37] cashthb: ...or just take the balloon
[2:00:38] Syphero: Hey Hazel, I was wondering if your "lazy" speed set guide was still accurate? of course not for the SL stuff, but trying to plow through the essays on wowhead makes my head hurt beelieDerp
[2:01:13] tideffect: have you heard of the addon: unlimited map pin distance? really handy for distant quests/tracking
[2:01:22] Rendwee: The shadowlands speed set stuff works kinda as long as you're not above level 61
[2:01:47] Syphero: Okay, no that's fair, that's what I understood about it :)
[2:01:50] Rendwee: You kind of want to be 61 to be able to get the speed potion and use it from dragonflight
[2:03:03] wolfcloudchaser80: Magpies are active in Azure Span... unless that's server specific?
[2:03:04] msmester1: if you dont mind mentioning other content creators SoulSoBreezy made a really nice speed set video 3 days ago
[2:03:18] Syphero: I'm not trying to be 100% efficient anyway, just want to boost my ghost wolf a bit more for mount runs :)
[2:03:26] Syphero: oh cool, I'll check Breezy then
[2:03:41] L3fis: whats this questline lol
[2:03:45] jgbrit: Random question that's just entered my brain from the aether.... do you have to wash your wigs?
[2:04:05] Tragicarp: She's an auctioneer,
[2:04:07] heldtheline: it's the auctioneer, iirc
[2:04:08] FrostBeered: Gnome down!
[2:04:14] FrilleJr: its one of the ah npc's
[2:04:19] msmester1: its one of the bankers maybe?
[2:04:23] EvilOreoCake: I believe they are in there. I believe it is the far right auctioneer.
[2:04:55] FrostBeered: @HazelNuttyGames You need to get a wig that's pink pigtails
[2:05:00] msmester1: with 1 min rez sickess rezzing and flying would have been faster LUL
[2:05:03] FrostBeered: for gnomes :)
[2:05:13] EvilOreoCake: When I did it I just popped evasion and cried lol
[2:05:50] Tragicarp: I was able to target her from outside the auction house then shadow step.
[2:05:53] jgbrit: I feel like this isn't great quest design considering the gaurds can find you
[2:05:56] FrostBeered: @HazelNuttyGames You should do the rogue legendary dagger questline
[2:05:59] msmester1: also can use distract
[2:06:20] FrostBeered: @HazelNuttyGames Fangs of the father
[2:06:46] FrostBeered: Its awesome
[2:06:54] LilyOfTremere: It was surprisingly fun, yea ^^
[2:06:54] Pathstrider: i went iutlaw popped all cds including evasion and pistol shot to 5 points then used the ranged spender. stood behind ah as u can target thru wall
[2:06:59] Rendwee: Its not awesome because you have to run dragon soul a whole bunch..
[2:07:12] Kurama__95: The rogue leggo questline is great, the bad part is running Dragon Soul LUL
[2:08:05] tideffect: if it says take the portal in quest description on the right it means it s not final destination
[2:08:05] msmester1: just use dalaran hs and worst case you go stormwin
[2:08:25] cinnabuhn: I miss legion sm sometimes
[2:08:33] Danoria: I just won a soulbound mount that you can only learn if you are alliance
[2:09:08] vakaarian: he has to make sure you arent a demon in disguise
[2:09:13] msmester1: You have to how would he know if someone digused as you duh
[2:09:15] jgbrit: Did you buy cheese to get in here?
[2:09:37] jgbrit: Lol
[2:09:37] Danoria: I'm on my main who is horde üòÜ
[2:09:38] Xeressia: Very dramatic!
[2:09:48] nyrhalahotep: so dramatic
[2:09:50] Zuldak: dont forget to buy the alternet colors
[2:09:51] FrostBeered: I want a mog that looks like Valeria
[2:09:52] Kurama__95: Now you can buy the other 3 LUL
[2:09:57] Tragicarp: buy more from the gnome.
[2:10:02] jgbrit: Paladin mounts next?
[2:10:03] AlleviateWoW: how long does it take to do a class hall for the mount
[2:10:08] Danoria: So said I can't even send it to my ally
[2:10:25] kpatt17: For the class hall stuff do you have to do it on all classes?
[2:10:33] nyrhalahotep: classic lich kinf bloodmyst isle medical supplies
[2:10:35] Kurama__95: Padding those mount parses EZ Clap
[2:10:36] amaya21: nice!!
[2:10:53] Mori_8110: hazelWave
[2:10:57] FrostBeered: @HazelNuttyGames Good thing its not like the warlock mounts where they drop off rares
[2:10:58] msmester1: this is my go to mount this day hopefully its gonna get dragonflying
[2:11:13] witchhobbit: i love finding out i have progress already on something in wow haha
[2:11:31] cinnabuhn: I have the monk one but he never shuts up NotLikeThis
[2:11:33] SneakySquidy: I did all the class mounts during covid lockdown.. Nice way to spend it
[2:11:40] jgbrit: The green and red are lovely
[2:11:41] amaya21: i like the purple one
[2:11:48] LilyOfTremere: Yea the hat's a lil silly x)

[2:11:57] msmester1: i wish it had a ground animation it just fies...
[2:12:14] amaya21: do you have shaman's?
[2:12:26] jgbrit: PALLY hazelWave hazelWave
[2:12:33] Kurama__95: Paladin for +4
[2:12:34] sence_00: 4 pally
[2:12:44] FrostBeered: Paladin theres like 4
[2:12:52] amaya21: yeah paladin!
[2:13:02] jgbrit: Paladin are gorgeous mounts
[2:13:10] helheimr: 4 for pally, but pally is an exceptional case of having one at least for each race and another in the argent tournament
[2:13:11] cashthb: you should do mage, it's the lamest so best get it out of the way while you're motivated
[2:13:14] witchhobbit: i love the pally ones so much
[2:13:23] FrostBeered: Don't forget the death knight one, its cool
[2:13:28] Kurama__95: The annoying part is that a lot of the campaign is timegated by the mission table stuff
[2:13:30] jgbrit: They leave hoof marks when you run/fly
[2:13:33] msmester1: im kinda suprised you dont have these each time i level a class this is the rason why i do legion
[2:13:36] Atomicpanda: oh my

[2:27:39] wrathofgob: your spreadsheet says we are supposed to yell at you
[2:28:15] jack_fraust: you don't need an expensive pc to run a good number of add ons, you just need to manage the adds
[2:28:20] CoffeeASAP: omg, I am talking to a blizzz gm about this exact issue lol
[2:28:22] jeffdmk: another reason to not be a gnome

[2:30:51] msmester1: Kappa
[2:30:52] PapaNeeks: I love this one
[2:31:37] msmester1: use it anyway level 10 weapons rule
[2:31:38] Zuldak: legion is the worst xpac to level in without heirlooms due to the artifacts being the only weapons
[2:31:47] jeffdmk: soundless might be a better choice
[2:31:59] PapaNeeks: ‚Äúgive me the strength to shatter these bonds‚Äù
[2:32:05] jack_fraust: is there an add that switches your minimap clan button to the proper expansion as your in it????
[2:32:12] pikapoo0: eonar is still a pain to do
[2:32:25] IntrepidKor: You should run Rise +2 over and over for dungeon mounts
[2:32:35] DapherCake: I recently got shackled ur'zul after 69 attempts. absolute nightmare lol
[2:32:39] Bo96ma: how many mounts u have so far?
[2:32:46] ScatteRRealmS: Someone obtained everything in WoW this year - what would you do if you'd collected -everything-?
[2:32:49] PapaNeeks: this is where we see Tyrion pass on for real
[2:33:01] jack_fraust: is there an add that switches your minimap clan button to the proper expansion as your in it????
[2:33:05] dmorrygan: Green infernal from gul'dan is the bane of my existence, i've done 300+ runs and it still hasn't dropped...
[2:33:05] NamiWhami: I just got the 500 mount achievement and I can't imagine having 200 more lol
[2:33:10] amaya21: what will you do first thing when the patch comes on?
[2:33:37] msmester1: btw anyone knows is there any addon that puts the clock back to the bottom of the minimap?

[2:33:45] alisoninaisle10: can finally play the game
[2:33:50] Perkolate: yo whats for lunch
[2:34:05] maachen: On the one hand, I hate mount farming. On the other hand, I like getting mounts. What am I supposed to do?
[2:34:10] ScatteRRealmS: @alisoninaisle10 Bahahaha
[2:34:11] GreenArrowed: oooh pho
[2:34:11] Zuldak: the palies are nice. The rogues are cheap with the transit
[2:34:14] ghostie1995: pho is so good
[2:34:23] Zuldak: the rogues dont pay for the uber

[2:34:29] Kurama__95: I feel like collecting EVERYTHING in WoW would give me a sense of dread and void I've never felt before LUL
[2:34:37] dmorrygan: know what real commitment is ? doing balance of power on every single class before it was made account wide

[2:35:37] Atomicpanda: poor quality nori?
[2:35:37] pikapoo0: the bamboo sheets helped with rolling sushi

[2:35:48] Kurama__95: The real skill of a collector is to know when procrastination pays out
[2:36:05] Atomicpanda: maybe too dry?
[2:36:28] jgbrit: I love this order hall so much
[2:36:31] PapaNeeks: it‚Äôs so weird seeing this and not hearing the good voice acting
[2:36:56] Sunabubus: I wonder if anyone has problems with All The Things since (one of) the last updates. Without all the things I feel myself blind, and tooltips randomly disappear.

[2:37:06] Kurama__95: savixKEKW

[2:39:18] fisherreads: what are some classic Canadian dishes that you grew up with?
[2:39:29] Atomicpanda: lol i was kidding. curry and rice always sounds like korean rice. youtube even subtitles it like that sometimes
[2:39:33] ScatteRRealmS: My partner is a chef from India so I'm very spoiled

[2:42:25] msmester1: is there an expedion table in dragonflight? i hope not LUL
[2:42:31] jack_fraust: it's literally a small amount of pages of codes maybe even less since the data still exits for the older ones

[2:44:05] yourKnightmaare: hazel if you're in the southern california area, even though you're not vegan, I have a lot of vegan friends and there are some spots that are jaw dropping delicious vegan food
[2:44:11] tempo119: it's ok to eat fish cause they don't have any feelinga
[2:44:28] zfbedos: you trying to get corrupted ash bringer?

[2:45:23] cashthb: what about scary animals?
[2:45:28] archermoo: My mom named the chickens and steer that we raised for foon.

[2:45:38] archermoo: Food that is...

[2:46:11] TheDunpeal: everything is food for something else
[2:46:15] VaeVictisATL: Yea, if you ever clear a field to plant veggies, you'd know the amount of ground nesting animals you murk.
[2:46:18] nyrhalahotep: I heard that plants can SEE us... sigh üò©
[2:46:25] Kurama__95: Alright, mission talbe roadblock, time for the warlock campaign Kappa
[2:46:37] nyrhalahotep: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

[2:46:57] nyrhalahotep: a plant uprising sounds like a Doctor Who episode
[2:46:58] LKatey75: My pothos and philodendren are so forgiving about forgetting to water them
[2:47:05] VaeVictisATL: Plants are much smarter than we give them credit for. The mushrooms that infect ants and take over their minds to infect the colony is wild.
