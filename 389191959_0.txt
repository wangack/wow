[4:46:22] Un0neTV: Wou wou this is actually good. Gearing in BfA is hard. Even if you PvE 27/7 you might easily lack ideal secondary stats. Although! We are PvPers! We should pe proud for the power we got and the power we have obtained. And keep doing cool opens, setups and stuff. Even with a lower gear. SMOrc
