[3:15:26] strike879: dirt mounds and bags get seen by rare addons so no doubt rarity can count them too
[3:15:29] Kasaiya13: no its a green item
[3:15:33] inj0shwetrust: you click it and the treasure shows up on your map

[3:40:15] preswrx15: @Towelliee can i join u as a second Tank warrior ?
[3:40:20] strike879: problem is allot of crafting order items need items of the craft spec so for enginering you need items made by enginering it wouldve been better if the crafting orders took raw mats so no bolts but ore
[3:40:25] Holysal: @shytam and plus ppl only want bis items and the cost is high rn
[3:40:46] balancedlight: liquid will be trying to clear last boss by tonight

[4:00:39] Saucy722: I’ve said since BFA that leaving a key should be on your IO. 2 key forgiveness after that a black skull to signify you’re a key killer
[4:01:00] metavahn231: why people act like that in WoW, not that much happens in FFXIV
[4:01:00] Brotie: yeah a52 is the new SA zoo for sure, some real creatures on that server
