[6:49:51] Galdrena: if you are a new player I would level up first @Privategrubby
[6:49:55] Privategrubby: is it easy to get gear o pvp?

[6:50:28] Kadly101: Swifty are you more hyped for Cata or classic+ if u had to pick 1
[6:50:31] Djinx_o: The hard part is the Game Knowledge (knowing all classes and how to fight them)

[6:54:38] Akwxsy: @Privategrubby a lot of the problems in WoW are both the devs and the players, but people only blame devs
[6:54:38] JohnSpecter: when does the new season start next week?
[6:55:12] Applebabe18: Did you get full blood token gears?
[6:55:23] Akwxsy: @Kadly101 Eh, that gets annoying with how up to speed most people are in the game now a days. You're not going to see many 1v5's unless you're miles ahead of people.
[6:55:41] swiftpwns: how many people can you queue with inti blitz?

[6:56:53] Kadly101: @Akwxsy yea but thats why classic+ is a big deal, plus everyone isnt supposed to have an out. Thats what i meant about unbalanced. They made the game an even playing field when it should be a rock paper scissors type of fight
[6:57:26] hanomiere: The noise was me, dont mind me... just playing some games :D
[6:57:33] kroopz: Nice, so you have the space secured for the arcade? Big step! Congrats

[6:58:05] Akwxsy: @Kadly101 A lot of people hate the rock paper scissors. Especially in something like arena specifically, it's like what's the point of quing into rock paper scissors? If I am paper and the enemy team is scissors, I should just leave.
[6:58:15] swiftpwns: i have quake 3 sounds  as an addon for wow, its so fun
