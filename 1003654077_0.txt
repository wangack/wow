[0:43:39] Kinghorn: DKs pissed on twitter they think preach is getting AMZ nerfed LUL
[0:44:07] Mitune: I get the feeling that Blizz has already written off 9.1 as anything other than a buffer for 9.2.
[0:44:10] PvtHudson093: Ion had nothing much to say about it
[0:44:10] Shadowlemur01: You said July 13 didnt you @Towelliee

[0:47:13] PvtHudson093: Preach was saying up until the start of the interview he was adamant that energy was going from soulbinds
[0:47:14] Shapelessdnb: @Towelliee Yeah but I think that's because he never really 'answers' them.
[0:47:18] Mitune: Well it was meant to be a discussion instead of a Q&A, but even Preach said it didnt go like he wanted
[0:47:28] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Boot my parses Kappa

[0:54:36] MrGattz: @jasperboy its something thats for sure. im not gonna watch it lol
[0:54:40] Gurtington_: Pocketmitti subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!

[0:55:45] Mitune: Thats what got me though cause the Sylvannas bow new ability thing could help with alot of stuff imo @ravenoushydra
[0:55:49] mewkittymon: Yes
[0:55:56] Layercake: gsxrPALM i would never understand questions about class balances ...like the feral or the hpaly one. There are so many important things to focus that impact everyone

[0:57:14] briciod: at the end of the day, what we're all saying will be irrelevant beacuse retail wow is gonna still have a ton of people playing it regardless of how things look

[0:58:10] elexi30: towHi
[0:58:11] Shadowlemur01: preach was doing it
[0:58:12] Kinghorn: nitema11Hi Sollice

[0:58:15] ravenoushydra: I never win as alliance on eu
[0:58:26] Battakoru: Hi br, best regards from Mexico! :D
[0:58:29] Sollice: @desti_gaming Your not being banned. Moobot is removing your message because there is no giveaway command and we dont want it spammed
[0:58:30] SSD511_: Man i que for the pass hour as alliance I never win AV
[0:58:33] Mitune: Yeah, but its just the same thing. Preach was doing it for the past ocuple hours
[0:59:02] plumpus81: are the new floors just different wings from the upcoming raid??

[0:59:33] Shadowlemur01: the talents no, but the gem yeah
[0:59:41] Battakoru: Nice spanish jeje
[0:59:43] Mitune: The gems are in and the talent points rewards, but no talent tree

[0:59:48] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee

[1:00:07] Shadowlemur01: I liked visions, just got tired of the same maps
[1:00:16] officialviz: @Shadowlemur01 You're a masochist.
[1:00:20] raptorstrick: Yes.  Preach was on the bonus floors
[1:00:46] PvtHudson093: visions could have done with 2 more city maps like IF and TB
[1:00:50] DeanoTV: mmochamp has the talent tree @Towelliee
[1:00:54] Shadowlemur01: @Shadowlemur01 towLul

[1:02:46] Casiope7: https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/9852-Patch-9-1-PTR-Torghast-Perks-Early-Preview
[1:02:48] Casiope7: there

[1:04:14] Sollice: What's the portal thing do?
[1:04:15] Mitune: It is still choreghast sadly

[1:04:23] Bazsidiver: cost?
[1:04:26] Verynicepotato: d
[1:04:27] Magdelia: @Sollice i think its the dark portal hearthstone
[1:04:34] Sollice: That would be bad ass @Magdelia

[1:04:57] Magdelia: @Sollice would be very Pog
[1:04:59] Shugaze: toys are for bc 100%
[1:05:00] Ithylz: Probably both
[1:05:01] Lokajin: TL:DR of it is they basically made torghast into the nephalim rift system from Diablo 3.
[1:05:05] pepedeeee: 7 ads in a row
[1:05:09] NILLme: if you look closely one of them is HD so i guess for retail and tbc
[1:05:11] Ithylz: HD one for live and LD one for BC
[1:05:23] PvtHudson093: the warpstalker has 2 versions

[1:05:39] Shugaze: makes sense
[1:05:47] Ithylz: Yep, I would think this way
[1:05:50] zskeech: when is pre patch even coming
[1:05:52] Magdelia: TRUE LULW
[1:05:53] Mitune: Probably both for retail is my guess but low quality would be for tbbc
[1:05:55] DiranJei: ooooo good call. I was thinking itd be real jarring to have a high def mount in BC
[1:05:57] Shugaze: these toys were in BC
[1:06:04] DeanoTV: LUL
[1:06:08] Magdelia: # notmyTBC
[1:06:27] shale93: mounts in store. guess I wont enjoy the TBC anymore PepeHands
[1:06:35] Korupcija_: new build Pog
[1:07:02] Kinghorn: it is to keep chat less cluttered
[1:07:11] zskeech: pre patch tbc when

[1:08:47] Kinghorn: bring back unnerfed cata heroics
[1:08:54] xiamrs: ^
[1:09:01] Magdelia: i loved the cata dungeons
[1:09:02] iplayhots: cata was hard?
[1:09:04] MrDadZee: Stream's looking madness relax; What are you into most likely ?
[1:09:10] Trollaxe: that was so much fun
[1:09:10] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[1:09:16] Kinghorn: for a month then they gutted it iplayhots
[1:09:21] chukudu: rap god towPog
[1:09:30] Mitune: thats the problem they double down on their mistakes way too long
[1:09:39] ajax2323: definitely feels like they keep scaling retail dungens back towards an easier middle ground
[1:09:40] Shadowlemur01: Cata heroics holy hell
[1:09:52] MrDadZee: I meant, PvE or Pvp ?
[1:09:58] Scarhearth: stonecore after nerfs was still a difficult dungeon.
[1:10:07] MrDadZee: Or just whatever you feels like on a daily basis
[1:10:12] MrDadZee: !Server
[1:10:12] Moobot: @ZeeTanK TBC is around the corner! If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde!

[1:10:48] postboy710: i‚Äôve wiped in stonecore on tw this xpac LUL
[1:10:55] bhxkazzam1: i think its because they are slow to adapt. they have no choice to doubledown because stuff is plan 6 month ahead of time. and they cant turn the train
[1:10:58] ajax2323: !putmeinthegiveaway
[1:10:59] Sollice: So everyone when TBC keys are given out, like ALL of our giveaways, they will be done via the Discord channel
[1:11:03] Scarhearth: Ozruk still gives me PTSD
[1:11:09] geokouts: No this is Patrick :P
[1:11:19] Kinghorn: break yourself upon my body Scarhearth
[1:11:24] Sollice: So if I were you, I would get in to Discord now, hang out in there and when key's go out they will be announced here to check Discord
[1:11:26] skashedd: what was that? am I supposed to spam the giveaway command now?

[1:11:38] Kinghorn: america, azuresong
[1:11:39] masterlee05: @Sollice can i join discord to so i have a chance of a tbc key giveaway?
[1:11:52] Zorman86: Is it worth to start leveling from 0 atm ? Or better wait till TBC ?
[1:11:55] MrDadZee: Amazing
[1:11:55] Sollice: You of course can @masterlee05 Go to the link I just put up above
[1:12:02] oneshot2real: Use the boost
[1:12:05] masterlee05: thx dude @Sollice !
[1:12:07] MrDadZee: t play retail at all ?

[1:12:24] Shadowlemur01: yeah he plays retail
[1:12:30] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[1:12:40] belfastcl: i haven't play retail wow in years, but can confirm that in eso is like that: if they screw up one patch, gotta wait for the next one
[1:12:45] Mitune: I feel like they havent even done that recently with patches. They double down all the way until the end now. Like if Legion legendary vendor came in sooner Legion would have been near perfect
[1:12:59] forcetriangle: or even a vault item
[1:13:10] ZiggiFTW: add-ing loot to mobs is more or less copy/paste

[1:14:04] Kinghorn: just press the no more conduit energy button
[1:14:14] raldrik: Good morning towelliee. Any idea when your gfuel code is going to be at 30%?
[1:14:18] Layercake: HahaThink make sense
[1:14:19] Mitune: true
[1:14:27] Unciatim: Its the obvious BS of his answers that irritates the most...
[1:14:30] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee I ran it for my gf 4 times last night and had no issues, I think i might have performance anxiety and can't do it with stream watching FeelsBadMan
[1:14:32] MrDadZee: What is the filtering process to be elligible to join The Hammer Squad ;; if you don't mind me asking.
[1:14:33] Scarhearth: conduit energy is worthless it just makes it so you cant respec if your offspec uses the same soulbind
[1:14:39] Shadowlemur01: Honestly, since i just go for curve and a few mythic bosses, i set my conduits and forget
[1:14:43] Kromede: jasperboy yay we are on page 1  https://twitchstats.net/longest-twitch-subscribers
[1:14:50] Sollice: He said "they were looking at it" but he did not commit AT ALL
[1:14:54] ajax2323: he mentioned lowering the cooldown potentially
[1:15:05] Armdel: didn't they just basically say "it could be better"
[1:15:05] Mitune: it was the system is not great, but yeah its there. That all he said bbasically
[1:15:10] jasperboy: @Kromede top dwags!
[1:15:13] Sollice: In fact he said he was giving us MORE choices by limiting our ability to swap easily
[1:15:14] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[1:15:15] its_Steevee: ive not once run into the issue where im out of conduit energy

[1:15:17] jasperboy: dawgs*
[1:15:23] mewkittymon: I think so
[1:15:23] mattmasters96: I feel like tho they make these over complex systems tht they do not even understand i.e: Covenants, Nethercrusable, azerite armor etc
[1:15:30] baraktus: are you leveling a blood elf paladin at tbc
[1:15:30] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:15:39] Shadowlemur01: because theyll just release a new expac in 18 months and it wont be a problem
[1:15:54] Mitune: Stygia does nothing 9.1 right?
[1:15:55] Calphurnious: Their version of better is probably giving us spec energy and talent energy
[1:16:05] Scarhearth: I really dont think soul ash is that big a deal tbh

[1:16:17] Sollice: There. I will throw that up every once in a while
[1:16:19] Layercake: Ion has being saying the '' moving forward we need to make it better'' far to many ways to people still believe it
[1:16:20] Korupcija_: he should sit down for a few hours and make a forum post like he used to
[1:16:20] ajax2323: yeah he explicitly said he wanted catch up mechanisms for alts but mentioned zero specifics
[1:16:20] Sollice: !room
[1:16:20] Moobot: @Sollice Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon‚Ñ¢
[1:16:35] mewkittymon: I wood love a skip for my olts .
[1:16:40] Ithylz: (from Wowhead) Ion said that they want to avoid situations where people are swapping every day, but every week, that's something they want to accommodate. Understand that as you wish
[1:16:46] Coaltino: hey towellie i love u
[1:16:49] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee you want me to boost your pally? I have the lower ones down pat ;)

[1:17:08] bonnzo79: @towelliee where is your hot tub stream lol
[1:17:09] chukudu: the horde is NOTHING
[1:17:11] Scarhearth: Most people only make a singular legendary for their alts
[1:17:25] SlayerLightStorm: @bonnzo79 He ain't having one.
[1:17:32] MrDadZee: @Towelliee  :: How can we apply to join The Hammer Squad even tho i'm a Demon Hunter and i'm not into hammer things ? :D
[1:17:33] CritcobainTV: @chukudu fite me
[1:17:45] Mitune: I made a single legendary for my main cause I needed nothing else even for mythic LUL @Scarhearth
[1:17:50] chukudu: @critcobain Sylvanas' words
[1:17:55] Sollice: lol
[1:18:01] MrDadZee: loll
[1:18:07] MrDadZee: I CAN'T USE HAMMER XD
[1:18:09] br0fest0r: NOTHING!
[1:18:15] bonnzo79: its hilarious the amount of hot tub streams on a gaming stream platform

[1:18:36] Scarhearth: @Mitune  pretty much same my main only has 2 legendaries. one for main spec and one for offspec
[1:18:42] MrDadZee: What if i send mom' tits pics to enter the THS ? Kappa
[1:19:07] ajax2323: i also just assume the new soul cinders functions as a soul ash catchup mechanic. do some high level torghast to get a whole bunch of soul ash and cinders, craft a lvl 1 leggo with the soul ash and upgrade it to 250 or whatever with inders
[1:19:09] Yagr6: the real question is when is towelliee gonna do a hot tub stream Kappa

[1:56:21] Leonin3: Raidbots assumes you're playing picture perfect and hitting a static boss like Patchwerk who does nothing but standstill for 5 mins
[1:56:21] Mecabeast: it costs roughly like 1200 valor to upgrade 184 to 200 minus weapons there's been more than enough time to get a few pieces upgrades we've also had the heroic weekly like 2or3x and once a month you get a 200 from doing timewalking.
[1:56:32] CrusaderNero: meh I should level my pala to 60.
[1:57:14] IWardawgI: i started playing Wow during the TBC
[1:57:18] Dahvark: well u said u wanted a tank

[1:57:21] Dahvark: but the druid showed up lol
[1:57:24] meijer32: I guess if keys are given out now the beta will last for a while still

[2:09:04] Korupcija_: why did he not talk about us losing all anima and sanctum progress if we swap covenant, that's thousands of anima
[2:09:17] Masqerader: and Ion is a lawyer and lawyers by default are never wrong lol
[2:09:18] AppalachianDruid: Pyromancer is the worst about that type of shit though
[2:09:27] joe_g_433: Hahah
[2:09:30] Murlock07: lol
[2:09:31] KristineTheUnicorn: Adianaplays subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! blobDance blobDance blobDance
[2:09:39] t_800_i: is this thing not dying?
[2:09:55] Dagomarus: So are we having a 9.3 or ?
[2:09:58] Thunderlops: never ending mob
[2:10:02] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee preach has also been wrong about tons of shit before.
[2:10:03] Naturalbeef: Love Preach but he wants the game designed solely for Mythic raiders
[2:10:08] zekobunny: Your spells won't work me on twoel
[2:10:15] MrDadZee: I don't personally but its true that some people are.
[2:10:20] seo1978: Difficult position though he certainly couldnt seem to agree with ion all the time or he'd turn his own audience off.
[2:10:23] CrusaderNero: preach should have adressed the lack of content to do for the masses of people in SL
[2:10:30] wraaith: and then ur both wrong coz we are twitch chat and are always correct
[2:10:30] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon‚Ñ¢
[2:10:41] AppalachianDruid: I love Preach, but Natural is right. Preach only cares about the 1% and considers Heroic raiding as casual
[2:10:47] CrusaderNero: I dont give one shit about what happens at mythic level or high m+ key levels, most people dont
[2:10:50] S1appadabass: Ya Ion isnt going to waiver on his answers, its best to just truck along and get the most info you can
[2:10:50] Masqerader: @Towelliee you need to see if you can do one of these Q and A
[2:11:02] JetsetBlackout: JetsetBlackout subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:11:14] seo1978: But there is something to be said for trusting your audience, ask the question, let Ion answer then let the audience decide what to believe, no need to question on their mehalf tbh.
[2:11:28] kokochris: towHAMUP towDrunk
[2:11:35] AppalachianDruid: Like there is PVP questions that people want answered, you expect Preach to ask those?
[2:11:46] Masqerader: no but you can ask decent questions
[2:11:50] Dagomarus: Well he did ask like 2 1%er questions rip AMZ LUL
[2:11:54] Unciatim: But at least Blizz/Ion admitted that Cov balancing needs more work... @Towelliee
[2:12:04] dyslexican1: I mean, their refusal to admit they are wrong is why people are so unhappy. Honestly this expansion has finally killed my love for wow, I have been playing since Vanilla and the horrible overall expansion FINALLY got me to quit. Blizzards refusal to listen to what the community wants has spoiled me on the whole company at this point.
[2:12:44] CrusaderNero: @dyslexican1 they have made the game for the select few that push mythic and high m+ keys.
[2:12:46] AppalachianDruid: I remember your Cata days
[2:12:55] fistofnature: im 1 % of all pet battlers Kappa
[2:13:08] Sarcastard: Wrath was the AOE expansion
[2:13:16] MrDadZee: Alot of people don't have the IRL time to push hard on WoW.
[2:13:18] GwenNightsong: I'm a heroic raider only, I've never done Mythic Progression.
[2:13:19] ArcaneSyntax: @dyslexican1 dont confuse what you want, with what everyone wants.
[2:13:19] Jermo11: i want to play wow but i cant enjoy anything in SL NotLikeThis
[2:13:24] nonstopdisco: towelliee are you gonna boost any?
[2:13:27] IWardawgI: if Blizzard ONLY cared about 1%ers theyd have no game

[2:13:34] ConorMilne1234: @towelliee Would you be able to recommend a class for someone who wants to play TBC but doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time? Something that can progress solo without it being a terrible experience
[2:13:38] MrGattz: @IWardawgI well they would have no players
[2:13:39] TheMaxxar: !giveaways
[2:13:39] Moobot: @TheMaxxar Be on Discord. I will announce the giveaways as I play some Classic. Be active and be IN Twitch chat at time of winning.
[2:13:45] MrGattz: they would still have a game
[2:13:47] dyslexican1: @CrusaderNero Yeah but M+ is horrifically bad, and un-fun this expansion.
[2:13:48] Holysal: @IWardawgI thats facts. look what happened to Wildstar
[2:13:49] MrGattz: kinda like wildstar
[2:13:49] IWardawgI: @mrgattz exactly
[2:13:54] oneshot2real: I feel like wow is like a children that you care about and you worry about their how there going thru life and want them change but don‚Äôt because they are stubborn .
[2:13:57] MrGattz: also rip wildstar
[2:13:57] Sarcastard: Bring back CC to Dungeons and raids....
[2:14:04] Cr0wler: I would¬¥ve maybe dived deeper into torghast questions because it has so much potential but is pretty lackluster :(
[2:14:04] ConorMilne1234: @towelliee Would you be able to recommend a class for someone who wants to play TBC but doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time? Something that can progress solo without it being a terrible experience
[2:14:08] xluckydawgx: RIP Wildstar
[2:14:10] MrDadZee: I do the 3 things. I push hardcore life content at the office, i push hardcore content in game, and i have en tinre familly to feed. + Streaming what i do coz i love it.
[2:14:13] Korupcija_: do you think Ion should write a forum post like he used to
[2:14:23] ContraRob: I feel weird, because while I think the game isn't perfect, I still think it's really good and Shadowlands is a good expansion. The first patch is just overstaying it's welcome a bit, but I still really like it. Feels strange to be teh outsider
[2:14:23] AppalachianDruid: I think they should have just skipped the Covenant idea and just unpruned more abilities, then built the talent trees around those abilities to add variety of play styles.
[2:14:23] AsapXO: Ion should do an interview with asmongold
[2:14:24] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee bonus rolls would have been a better questoon than rehashing covenants again for the 100th time.
[2:14:27] Killux3: Mob was parry haste hitting your most likely
[2:14:32] Masqerader: question 1 "Ion, u made it so I have to buy 2 months of gametime for giveaways, why you trying to bleed my homie"
[2:14:39] ConorMilne1234: @towelliee Would you be able to recommend a class for someone who wants to play TBC but doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time? Something that can progress solo without it being a terrible experience
[2:14:40] CrusaderNero: yeah m+ is a shit feature in retail
[2:14:42] MrDadZee: So i am guessing you've been there and you've been doing that at some point.
[2:14:49] Mitune: I wonder what would go through these NPC minds if they could say. Just being used as a target dummy LUL
[2:14:52] Jermo11: legion was awesome
[2:14:53] Yagr6: @Towelliee speaking on the melee problem , why cant they do something with windfury? make it good and kill 2 birds with one stone by also making enhance wanted!
[2:14:58] Caedranos: Legion was perfect
[2:15:00] verdant85: 100%
[2:15:07] Mecabeast: hell druids just spam manual crowd pummlers till tbc
[2:15:29] AppalachianDruid: Was there any questions asked about the potential of Master Looter coming back?
[2:15:32] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[2:15:39] Unciatim: @Towelliee Honstly.... I would take a single weekly bonus roll that was guaranteed to let me pick a piece of gear..... im tired of going weeks without an upgrade.... I accept RNG but this shit gets old...
[2:15:48] KaisenSiru: No one liked the AP grind and Maw degeneracy
[2:15:50] xluckydawgx: I got into FFXIV again in this drought!
[2:15:51] Masqerader: @GoldenCorralSexDungeon sloot asked that months ago, they don't plan to bring it back
[2:15:59] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[2:15:59] AureliusXV: no one cares people are quitting lol
[2:15:59] AppalachianDruid: That's lame
[2:16:06] Mitune: I think the numbers are going to go down with 9.1
[2:16:14] temp3st98: tbc will overcome retail for sure
[2:16:15] masterlee05: true, i quit my wow sub 5 days ago, to many boosters in 2vs2 and couldnt not get 1800 rating.....
[2:16:17] Domini1001: @Towelliee  cannot agree with you back in a day casual players were absolutely fine crafting good gear and becoming stronger throught crafting system which wasnt present in ELgion at all
[2:16:19] ArcaneSyntax: @raijuu88 if they make it so raids want 7 melee than enhance will be a great pick.
[2:16:23] Masqerader: @Mitune i disagree people always comeback for flying LOL
[2:16:32] CrusaderNero: kill sylvanas on LFR, unsub. GG
[2:16:33] stratiss: If it was  as bad of a problem as you presume don't you think it would a priority for Blizzard?
[2:16:35] Mecabeast: did they reschedule the raid testing for this week I don't remember seeing anything
[2:16:40] ConorMilne1234: @towelliee Would you be able to recommend a class for someone who wants to play TBC but doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time? Something that can progress solo without it being a terrible experience

[2:18:07] masterlee05: o so hate sylvanas LUL hope she will become a raid boss
[2:18:11] Jermo11: items you remember
[2:18:20] AsapXO: this exp was so promising but they dont make QoL changes fast enough...idk about anyone else im tired of constant grinding of some power source
[2:18:21] stratiss: In your opinion, what ilevel should the solo casual player be able to obtain?
[2:18:22] AppalachianDruid: I miss the long Legendary weapon quest lines
[2:18:27] JetsetBlackout: Shit that bow makes me wanna gear out my hunter

[2:19:52] Quakezilla69: I have yet to get a shield drop on mt warrior. Still have a 200 shield.
[2:19:56] DeeZeeGames: as a guy who games a bit less now due to other shit, should i stop retail and do classic tbc?
[2:19:58] spanij: @Towelliee good morning any news for TBC RELEASE DATE?
[2:20:04] AppalachianDruid: You should be able to buy gear with Valor. Just like how it was in WOTLK and CATA
[2:20:13] Mitune: 14 and 15s arent even accessible to a lot of casual players
[2:20:16] Luuin: I dropped WoW and picked up FFXIV again cause I just couldn't stand doing 12 m+ runs and getting 2 pieces of gear and not being able to use either.
[2:20:20] Masqerader: all 10s should have been 216 and all 15s 226 is what I would have done
[2:20:24] Masqerader: given how shitty the vault is
[2:20:35] NovaSun84: ah fuck
[2:20:38] koppapride: @Towelliee Do you know why they dont do class sets anymore? I played mainly wotlk so I can't understand :(
[2:20:42] DeeZeeGames: i hate how ffxiv has loading when you go to a different zone, hate that in mmos
[2:20:44] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee they should increase the items to 3 in a M+ dungeon
[2:20:47] Mecabeast: I don't like that you can't upgrade to equivalent of the vault for dungeon gear. also don't like that you can't get drops equal to the vault.
[2:20:56] NovaSun84: I gotta get into mythic pluses to get gear?  RIP, i'm fucked because of raider.io
[2:21:01] joe_g_433: The problem for casual to get 220 gear is that you need KSM. 213 is the realistic limit
[2:21:07] byrdeen45: bring back WF abd TF
[2:21:13] CrusaderNero: you are correct. Either you tryhard m+, or you run around collecting stuff from old content.
[2:21:15] oneshot2real: Pay for the boost
[2:21:21] KaisenSiru: They can dip, they won't be missed.
[2:21:26] JetsetBlackout: @novasun00 yeah raider.io does make it difficult. Because they just look for a number and thats it
[2:21:32] Mitune: It feel really bad to beat Heroic raid and still feel like you accomplished nothing cause of the gear difference
[2:21:33] PUBGesus1392: prediction on the success of BC?
[2:21:40] AppalachianDruid: I feel like the whole selling point of the expansion was the unpruned abilities, and they didnt really expand on that.
[2:21:41] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[2:21:44] pipboy733: where do you pay to boost?
[2:21:44] Thunderlops: if the valor wasn't capped or less expensive it would help a lot with gearing
[2:21:53] pipboy733: just a random advertiser in chat?
[2:21:57] Sarcastard: sux for rogues who don't pvp... raid weapon drops are the last boss and a 5th-6th boss... where most others drop sooner
[2:21:59] satanic_viewer: I would love to have a beer with towelliee watching some nba or nfl
[2:22:26] NovaSun84: it's actually disgusting loading into Retail.  It's just ALL SPAM wts boost arena / mythic
[2:22:29] Exodeo_: I still love that people made a big qq post about you buying that boost LUL

[2:23:11] Goindeeptv: @Novasun00 what happened to everyone settling into a guild to do raids instead of paying
[2:23:17] AppalachianDruid: Just make a Justice and Valor gear vendor like Cata. Be able to buy gear from doing dungeons.
[2:23:24] GwenNightsong: I'm not an arena person either. But I love doing Battlegrounds for fun.
[2:23:24] Goindeeptv: its sad
[2:23:28] Yagr6: im more of a RBG guy but they dont really care about the RBG community

[2:24:07] Domini1001: @Towelliee  im GLAD to watch you :)
[2:24:12] Mitune: People care way too much about how people get gear. Even the Devs seem to care way too much
[2:24:21] oneshot2real: Which service did you use?

[2:24:40] oneshot2real: I just wanted the transmog
[2:24:42] gangstafred: i played a lot of alts and then they reduce the loot, it would have taken too much time to gear them
[2:24:43] aikopooh: lol
[2:24:51] tewu_: immortal mob
[2:24:53] DeeZeeGames: i wish tbc classic had a switch for retail graphics like d2

[2:25:29] Mitune: Trill carried that whole guild LUL
[2:25:36] byrdeen45: been playing from vanilla and even all through wod and it took shadowlands to get me to step back becouse its so bad
[2:25:56] Sollice: I think he said he wished they knew PVP weapons had that high of an ilvl when they first started they would have farmed it

[3:52:49] LilChiliMPH: Anyone else feel like twitch will come out with a nsfw category that will cost an additional fee to "unlock" it?
[3:52:51] Wildside1177: @Bombayshow That is the parents job. Take care of your chioldren. We cannot bubble wrap the world.
[3:52:52] Reckless_Monk: pokimane would say.. "no"
[3:52:57] S1appadabass: the "yoga" ones are the most egregious imo
[3:53:00] chrslp: They turned from a WoW stream to a hot tub stream LUL
[3:53:01] King_Ween: Twitch needs a horny jail
[3:53:01] raldrik: I just need twitch to not get banned by company firewall because of those
[3:53:07] Pufendorf99: @Holysal That may be true :)
[3:53:12] Bombayshow: Wildside1177 Dude ,. you were young and you know parents cant do shit agaisnt your young ass seeking porn LUL
[3:53:16] Sollice: Just Thirsting
[3:53:22] McGreeb: they need to make an xTwitch.tv and move them there
[3:53:23] Chiraakitteh: What do you have against ducks? Kappa
[3:53:28] onyx_pupper: i agree with asmon that they shouldnt be allowed to promote only fans
[3:53:41] Kinghorn: the wild west of twitch
[3:53:47] enthroned1: we wouldnt habe that problem if we only got pornhub gaming :(
[3:53:47] RetiredNavyVet: @Towelliee its because of what you "might" see that is the thrill of watching
[3:53:52] DaxxTMI: When pornhub isn't enough, just watch twitch

[3:54:03] Broomba: just chatting is crossing the line of BDSM @towelliee
[3:54:10] stallowned: yea thats too far
[3:54:13] Sollice: @RetiredNavyVet That is 100% it. We are very voyeuristic in nature
[3:54:14] Wildside1177: @Bombayshow Censorship is not the answer either. Teach kids what it is. Censoring twtch will hurt young women and protect kids from nothing.
[3:54:31] tentrr: I bet they're not doing anything since Twitch is making a god damn buck off of the bathtub streams
[3:54:36] YardRage: they do it on their twitter too, right after they get temp banned
[3:54:43] ReturnOfBill: Worst part I dont like is shit rolls downhill when twitch takes action and ppl that do nothing get hit too.
[3:54:45] Bombayshow: Wildside1177  censoring twitch will hurt womans ..... Dude
[3:54:48] Thdlock: hey i cant wait for when you do the chairty dungeon event with fired up and shak have you read their bios LUL
[3:54:55] Chiraakitteh: It will probably take a lawsuit
[3:55:02] quakegoogl: ruyuBlue PopCorn ruyuF
[3:55:10] Bombayshow: Back then I had to find a sears magasine to fap
[3:55:13] Bombayshow: now they have twitch
[3:55:14] Kinghorn: kids dont need to find a playboy out in the woods to see tits these days
[3:55:14] Bombayshow: LUL
[3:55:15] Sollice: There is nothing to sue over
[3:55:18] RetiredNavyVet: come on! kids invented peep holes
[3:55:18] Reckless_Monk: that good fgood
[3:55:20] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[3:55:24] Bobbyk866: i have been dmed by streamers saying check out my instagram for better links like what you are a wow streamer lol
[3:55:25] beyondthevael: Yeah needs to be a certain level of censorship going on
[3:55:30] beyondthevael: Hustler hahah
[3:55:32] Wildside1177: Exactly so banning these women from twitch will accomplish nothing. That is my point. They will get "porn" is much worse places.
[3:55:33] Sollice: Man SKINIMAX was the shit
[3:55:34] AcidSyndicate: billions of cam sites, jsut watch them. no costs
[3:55:35] SonofHorus82: why does it matter? How does it actually negatively affect anything?
[3:55:43] Sollice: Watching that shit through BLURRED CHANNELS. That was some real committment
[3:55:48] Pufendorf99: Hmm wonder if there is a market for an somewhat overweight guy doing this. Dont have a hottub so I have to sit in a sink
[3:55:49] datswassup: boys will be boys
[3:55:52] Sollice: You young people have porn TOO EASY now
[3:55:52] shavinglove: Hustler?? Your dad didnt mess around with his pron!
[3:55:55] PvtHudson093: in my day we had to find discarded porn at the train station
[3:55:58] xendros78: wasn't the whole point of the changeover from justin to twitch to get back to more gamecentric content and move away from the IRL stuff?
[3:56:02] Justarandomman: Getting a paper round job at local newsagent and slipping a naughty magazine in (that's how I learnt) Lol
[3:56:03] twistedstick1: when they start to lose money they will do something about. Like they did with music.
[3:56:10] Chibs243: @fruity_pebbles2018 A pussy flash resulted in a 3 day ban, I‚Äôd guess a nipslip would result in a lesser ban
[3:56:11] Broomba: @towelliee or naked ladies on playing cards like in the 1980s
[3:56:17] Wildside1177: My response was a response to someone who suggested censorship. Moderation is a good idea for sure.
[3:56:23] dsj0: So bannorate you mean
[3:56:34] Lokajin: I remember the good ole days of having to steal a playboy or my dads VHS to watch porn. These dam youngins dont know the struggle @Sollice
[3:56:40] RetiredNavyVet: @Towelliee its the bad that draws the numbers, just like TV
[3:56:57] rage_loyce: what's up man I haven't been here in a while did you move and what's going on in the drama world that I walked into
[3:56:59] Bombayshow: girls doing hot tub stream eating themselves alive right now anyway LUL
[3:56:59] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:57:00] Sollice: @Lokajin When you got that one VHS you had to guard that shit with your life
[3:57:04] chrslp: In my day we had to walk 10 miles to the morse code station for some dot dot dot smut
[3:57:08] JimMaker: haha no, in the first two lines there are three of them
[3:57:09] sMoKe2501: Sasha grey streams, she does a normal twitch stream, which is ironic, heh
[3:57:10] raldrik: 3 in the top 10 are that, with another on the first screen doing bodypaint
[3:57:16] lmtheboogie: @towelliee you think twitch introduced lots of ads to annoy people so much that they are willing to pay to skip them? Like YouTube premium has no ads but you pay monthly
[3:57:20] datswassup: those girls will be perma wrinkled in two weeks
[3:57:20] Chibs243: But it‚Äôs the bad that needs to be dealt with, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs magnified
[3:57:26] SonofHorus82: Again, why does it matter and who is it actually negatively affect??
[3:57:26] seabass82: fuck gaming we want boobs
[3:57:39] crunchyFrog999: there are addons like unwanted twitch lol
[3:57:44] Thdlock: have you read firedup and shaks bios yet LUL
[3:57:48] Bombayshow: datswassup the day amourath will be ban is the day that peace will be on earth LUL
[3:57:48] Broomba: its a car accident everyone turns their head to look
[3:57:49] wastedx3149: @towelliee you more excited for tbc or 9.1?
[3:58:08] Justarandomman: What do you make of the PhantomLord trial (him winning) @Towelliee - you think this will make twitch more vigilant in their approach?
[3:58:12] twistedstick1: bajLG bajLG
[3:58:12] Holysal: 800 to 1700 io
[3:58:17] chrslp: Imagine trying to defend softcore porn streamers on a Gaming site when theres plenty of porn streaming sites
[3:58:17] SonofHorus82: Very nice charity choice.
[3:58:18] TazzTheGrimreapper: raider/io is trash...

[4:00:19] Kinghorn: she is a lock main

[4:02:04] Wildside1177: Some of those teams are loaded but you have Imfiredup - he is a wildcard. He will melt the universe for you.

[4:02:40] Kinghorn: all good charities eweaseWoo
[4:02:47] Denitor79: @Towelliee i have a way to make the MDI more enjoyable: random comps for every dung so its not the same 3-4 classes for every run

[4:18:27] DaxxTMI: sounds like a junction box
[4:18:39] Alepouditsa: aliens man the are evrywere Kappa
[4:18:43] joe_g_433: Yea it‚Äôs probably a floor box
[4:18:54] dv_domino: sounds like a cover plate

[4:19:38] SonofHorus82: after the CE info on wowhead this morning and all the crying candy's saying how they're going to stay in classic then I dunno maybe?
[4:19:41] Mitune: tbc has more staying power than classic  imo
[4:19:58] Saephon: I do expect higher numbers for TBC and WotLK when that day comes
[4:20:02] JeemTeam: lol let them stay in classic
[4:20:09] Saephon: just a lot more nostalgia and love for those eras
[4:20:09] mindrazor: BC is best version for sure
[4:20:15] Justarandomman: I just can't wait to do zangarmarsh quests, love that place
[4:20:51] Mitune: Phase 2 of Classic was also a mistake in Classic cycle. It 2 and 3 should have been combined
[4:20:55] Ghoost172: Never really got into raiding back in BC so gonna be fun to do it this time around
[4:20:56] Soproatlol: wonder when mop's turn will come
[4:21:27] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[4:21:37] enthroned1: yea bc wasnt as painful hard as vanilla, bit it wasnt as easy as everything after
[4:21:47] Justarandomman: Was crazy, and then jokered nearly 400k
[4:22:07] FearFreak13: SO IS 1-60 much easier once prepatch comes out then?
[4:22:24] darska87: darska87 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months, currently on a 41 month streak! 
[4:22:27] buddybeerbruh: As much as I like TBC wow's future is sealed. Activision is a company incapable of making the game good again. Waiting for the next good MMO is only option imo.
[4:22:31] ZeethianDragon: Classic was extremely overhyped like CyberPunk
[4:23:01] Justarandomman: I think classic has been really successful, it still very active and holding players - I expect the same from TBC
[4:23:01] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue

[4:23:26] dv_domino: are we going to be able to buy the boost when prepatch hits?
[4:23:40] Justarandomman: Sunwell isle <3
[4:23:43] YardRage: give me everything SwiftRage
[4:23:55] Noobinzzz: Speaking of tbc raids, do you have one you‚Äôre looking forward to the most?
[4:23:57] Mitune: I think Tbc was the most complete expansion release Blizz has done
[4:24:06] wastedx3149: people that want t5 on launch are sweaty pserver players
[4:24:27] piratechris: I bet we will end up with official servers for vanilla, TBC and Wrath if they don'y push "classic" even further
[4:25:03] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee

[4:25:25] Mitune: Phase 2 was a slog and a half in classic
[4:25:47] Waspire: then they quit the game...
[4:25:48] desmo7: eh thats not better
[4:25:52] desmo7: imo
[4:26:22] shmasherd: I loved how much more streamlined it was
[4:26:27] Episodical: endgame quests and stuff should send you to all the different zones
[4:26:27] kokochris: We called it Theme parking, each section is its own theme and quest hub.  It was a major change from MMO's prior to WoW
[4:26:28] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee it's better than classic where you have to level in 5 zones simultaneously.
[4:26:28] desmo7: true but I wish then old world didnt feel pointless
[4:27:00] Mitune: Def had better class design, but I think tbc had the edge on content progression @Clownstered
[4:27:16] Snilleblixten92: @Towelliee Not seeing you play Classic. You have made me continue on my UD Rogue atm lvl 42 hype
[4:27:19] mavericks312: you get a new game to get content not the old shit
[4:27:23] Snilleblixten92: Nice seeing*
[4:27:48] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee the night fae campaign sends you to boralus
[4:27:59] kokochris: I enjoyed the Legion invasions that brought us back to the Old world.  but that was a streamlined event
[4:28:07] mindrazor: Sometimes running around the world quest chains are fun--like that Crusader Bridenbrad thing in Wrath
[4:29:04] SonofHorus82: hooray the Linken questline!
[4:29:04] ArcaneSyntax: @mindrazor I think it works for specific quests that are trying a specific thing like that one, but when you have 5-6 different ones it's annoying

[4:29:10] Mitune: The place no one knows what is going on in tbc is shadowmoon. That place sucked
[4:29:34] AcidSyndicate: in 10 years reremastered of wow classic classic
[4:29:34] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:29:58] mindrazor: @ArcaneSyntax I agree. Just remarking that some specific chains are cool!
[4:30:11] Bobbyk866: what server are u on Towelliee
[4:30:28] loragheta: shadowmoon was amazing
[4:30:30] loragheta: yall bugging
[4:30:35] CallMeWallie: Getting atunement back in BC kind of sucked and felt like if you didn‚Äôt jump into raiding very early on you weren‚Äôt getting in unless you were over headed
[4:30:35] Mitune: it does but the mobs sucked
[4:30:38] CallMeWallie: Over geared
[4:30:42] delelyn: shadowmoon its a really heave lore zone but you need to read the quest to get everything
[4:30:42] Justarandomman: Unpopular opinion but Nagrand sucks.
[4:30:54] delelyn: if you dont thats why its sucks for some ppl
[4:31:04] ArcaneSyntax: i actually think ungoro might be my favorite leveling zone past 50, the only one I actually liked.
[4:31:04] toobaked1987: @Towlliee I have seen a lot of people talk about how great the WoD leveling experience was, is this true? I was deployed all of WoD.
[4:31:24] mavericks312: or just do dailies
[4:31:33] PidiaP: The Throne of the Elements quest in Shadowmoon are so good
[4:31:39] dalaraz: you do attunements meanwhile doing staff,it doesnt even get you out of your way
[4:31:39] Justarandomman: Lol was they being ironic @toobaked1987 on EU server first quest bugged for nearly 48hours, nobody could pass that point
[4:31:41] Celestia6: !Giveaways
[4:31:41] Moobot: @Celestia6 Be on Discord. I will announce the giveaways as I play some Classic. Be active and be IN Twitch chat at time of winning.
[4:31:46] PidiaP: Not to mention the arakkoa summoning an old god
[4:32:02] Saephon: @toobaked1987 I enjoyed WoD leveling and earning the flying. The launch raids were great too. Just a huge lack of content support later, and garrisons sucked all the life out of the game
[4:32:16] YardRage: content monkaS
[4:32:16] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[4:32:18] 2naDlisch: Too many people used attunements as an excuse why they couldn't raid
[4:32:36] toobaked1987: Yea. I just want to experience the story from WoD, if its worth it. I don't care about the expansion itself
[4:32:38] mavericks312: the attunements i thought were always cool little disappointed they dropped them
[4:32:40] loragheta: TBC attunements were a joke lmao
[4:32:41] sethzr: only "hard" attunement was kael for hyjal
[4:32:51] Celestia6: I really liked doing them
[4:32:53] Justarandomman: TBC has a place for everybody i feel, dailies, heroics, pvp, professions - you could farm mobs for rare recipes etc
[4:32:54] dalaraz: @toobaked1987 eh
[4:33:19] Avinar: I just think people didn't want to follow a list or massive quest line and such
[4:33:24] SonofHorus82: I adored the attunements in TBC. Classic attunements were meh, except for Onyxia.
[4:33:26] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee I actually kinda like attunements because it gives a sense of direction, like it's guide on what content you should be doing.
[4:33:33] Mitune: tbh I didnt even know what attunements were back then. I pvped and I was dumb as shit
[4:33:51] flyingbufanda: Have to get "The Insane!"
[4:33:55] loragheta: i got cheated out of hand of adal :( i did the quest and didnt get the title
[4:33:57] Justarandomman: I love 'Salty' title lol
[4:33:58] SonofHorus82: Lumberjack title for life!
[4:34:09] growent: "the crazy cat lady" that is the one i love XD
[4:34:13] Saephon: attunements feel SO good from a progression standpoint
[4:34:28] Justarandomman: I got The lady of war, on my paladin that is awesome (rare) title
[4:34:28] Saephon: I don't get people who don't find them satisfying on their first char at least
[4:34:29] Noobinzzz: I‚Äôm so hype to get all the way to shade of Aran for some guy to move slightly and wipe us from flame wreath
[4:34:30] Avinar: I kinda liked my legion titles. stuff like archdruid etc
[4:34:37] CallMeWallie: I guess it‚Äôs easy when you find a guild that likes you but I remember getting all the faction gear/best in slot to raid  blues and some epics and still no one wanted to take me for months till I find people
[4:34:46] CallMeWallie: Like middle to late TBC just for Kara
[4:34:55] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee I felt the same way about the legendary questlines in Mop and Wod, it was like an attunement.
[4:35:40] dalaraz: na tanaris is the lcosest
[4:35:46] agg_ie: Vanilla!!!.   I leveled a Holy Priest...on a pvp seerver...as holy...because I didnt know you could change your talents and wanted to be a heaelr
[4:35:55] mindrazor: I like how you could be questing in Outlands and suddenly be involved in a PVP situation and getting zone buffs for your faction and all that.
[4:35:55] toobaked1987: @Towelliee if you somewhat care about anima, there is about 3k on the map today
[4:35:55] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[4:35:59] Avinar: was the start but still rather group focused. I think cata was when it really targeted solo and OK to just bounce out because your class didn't matter as much. you could be easily replaced
[4:36:03] CallMeWallie: Yaaa, that‚Äôs what I remember, I feel like I had to wait a few months to actually play
[4:36:16] CallMeWallie: Which was fun-! When I got a guild but even then
[4:36:16] PvtHudson093: fuck that shit
[4:36:21] ArcaneSyntax: I loved that part LMAO
[4:36:26] CallMeWallie: Thank god I wasn‚Äôt a DPs
[4:36:29] Kson28: willl we get a new ptr build today?
[4:36:50] delelyn: farming the black prince rep tho that was a shit show the first day
[4:37:02] fflabitor: what addon you use for bar?

[4:42:14] Bombayshow: they teasing dragon isle a lot in SL
[4:42:36] Thdlock: ye but u need like 4 stars

[4:46:41] mavericks312: i cant wait for noob in the sequekl
[4:46:41] streatmagic_gaming: That was a literal spit take line when I watched it
[4:46:42] SonofHorus82: I went ahead and watched it for the 3rd time last night. So good.
[4:47:02] Sollice: The Kano character was so good
[4:47:06] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[4:47:17] onyx_pupper: i think people wanted everything in this one movie
[4:47:19] Sollice: Like little things when Lu Kang put his hand on Kano's shoulder and he looks at Lu Kang and says " What the fuck"
[4:47:27] ArcaneSyntax: The movie is a 7/10 just for the actors who play subzero and scorpion
[4:47:31] Sollice: Jax and his baby arms LOL best CGI EVER
[4:47:49] Uglyfoot: I like how Cole's special power was literally Plot Armor.. lol
[4:48:02] Sollice: Shit was the most boring "power" ever
[4:48:29] YardRage: D:
[4:48:32] onyx_pupper: wouldve been cooler if he got the chain like scorpion
[4:48:33] Avinar: I honestly felt mixed about scorpion. I like the hanzo feel but it was a rushed story and I wanted him FUELED by revenge and like he was chasing sub zero, not the lineage "protector." I guess he was God Damn mushu from Mulan
[4:48:34] mavericks312: alwas thought jax was a boring character

[4:49:25] SonofHorus82: @Sollice yeah I was kinda meh on him being some ancestor or Hanzo. Just give me Scorpion. Not looking for a deep as hell plot in my Mortal Kombat movies.
[4:49:57] Sollice: I didn't mind the plot behind him
[4:50:21] Avinar: every time Tyler ls armor turned red, the plot armor thickens.
[4:50:45] Sollice: I just didnt understand the character being so out of place. The first part of the movie I could HAVE SWORN that was his kid sister not his daughter
[4:51:35] Sollice: Sorry I am doing spoilers I probably shouldnt
[4:51:37] onyx_pupper: old shang tsung was so much better though
[4:52:05] ArcaneSyntax: They should just make that dude the new scorpion
[4:52:06] Avinar: yeah basically saying his armor is literally plot armor. he could just be beaten
[4:52:06] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon‚Ñ¢

[4:52:19] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:52:20] ArcaneSyntax: to be fair the actor who played old shang tsung is fucking legendary
[4:52:21] SavageCheez: yes
[4:52:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: he did the voice over for MK 11 game
[4:52:23] greedles: My mans power was getting his ass whooped lol with that being said, that movie was so much fun
[4:52:24] onyx_pupper: hes doingmore prdocution
[4:52:41] Bombayshow: liu kang not being a monk and a ufc fighter made me Laugh inside the theater
[4:52:42] Molvonos: @Towelliee They used him as their Shang model in MK11
[4:52:44] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee old shang tsung was in The Man in the High Castle show for amazon
[4:52:47] Molvonos: Voice acting and all
[4:52:48] dv_domino: yes he is. he lent his voice for mk11
[4:52:48] D3m0nHunt3r666: even his character on the movie resembles him lol
[4:52:51] Sollice: The problem with the movie is they way they told it should have been a two part movie and they made it 1
[4:52:52] PvtHudson093: cant wait to see who they cast as Johnny Cage
[4:52:57] SavageCheez: Last thing I saw him in was Man in the High Castle
[4:52:58] Avinar: True I miss 95's same with liu kang. I didn't like this version
[4:52:58] SonofHorus82: I liked all the characters they chose to be the baddies. I kinda wish Nitara had like... gotten any lines at all, but Mileena was baller.
[4:53:03] Sollice: The Miz wants to do the role
[4:53:10] Sollice: And I think he could be perfect for it
[4:53:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: John Cena
[4:53:15] SerMonstein: The Miz would nail it
[4:53:16] Bombayshow: the miz LUL he still exists ? TAKE HIM
[4:53:20] Sollice: No John Cena plz jesus
[4:53:25] YardRage: they'll prob hire a Brit like for Super Man LUL
[4:53:30] SonofHorus82: omg the Miz would be great!

[4:54:05] flyingbufanda: Rob Schneider
[4:54:05] Bombayshow: he need to be hot as fuck and know how to fight

[4:54:08] PvtHudson093: James Marsters
[4:54:09] greedles: I like the way they're doing the movies. Apparently it's pre tournament, tournament, post tournament. I think that's a pretty fun idea
[4:54:11] Uglyfoot: This movie had some cool fights but I still prefer the Original Mortal Kombat from the 90's. danOld
[4:54:15] zsoltix30: I heard that The Miz from WWE would like to take the role as Johnny Cage... :D

[4:55:07] croco_405: rayn renrolds
[4:55:08] PvtHudson093: the actor would have to be funny and bombastic
[4:55:09] toobaked1987: The same guy that said "Im jacked to the tits" is too serious?
[4:55:09] geokouts: We need an Arogant, Cocky and funny uy
[4:55:13] ArcaneSyntax: Gosling can do humor, but he'd never do it

[5:09:20] Wizdomrealizm: what does versatility do?
[5:09:50] Nico_vdM: It increases damage and healing and reduces damage taken
[5:09:52] agg_ie: So Thorgast is now instanace running in Diablo?

[5:17:54] shmasherd: Im just doom saying
[5:17:57] HuntingTurtle: bruh you were glacier slow
[5:18:10] SmokeBud24Seven: LUL
[5:18:35] ZeethianDragon: these timers better not be hella tight because that will kill torghast
[5:18:56] raptorstrick: He was on BM hunter
[5:19:10] toobaked1987: @Towelliee go get some GME while its still on sale.
[5:19:14] raptorstrick: He got 4stars
[5:20:02] Holysal: @zeethiandragon he said isnt just about speed
[5:20:17] Bombayshow: speed alone wont give you a lot of points you have to farm things
[5:20:28] toobaked1987: What Towelliee is saying is that Blizzard has introduced another meta slave system.
[5:20:30] ZeethianDragon: alright
[5:20:33] warrenny: Shouldve been like that from start
[5:20:39] SmokeBud24Seven: LUL @toobaked1987
[5:20:41] 91Niki: Maybe Ion is playing Diablo 3, cuz then there is definitely gear everywhere Kappa
[5:20:49] mavericks312: i think they have to add something great to make it appealing to keep doing
[5:20:56] ZeethianDragon: visions gave you good gear
[5:20:57] Bombayshow: toobaked1987is there a game out there not being metaed ? LUL
[5:21:13] ZeethianDragon: Torghast should give you ALOT of rewards
[5:21:24] SmokeBud24Seven: LUL
[5:21:27] HawtPepperTuna: Slower and efficient? What is "efficient"?!?
[5:21:36] mavericks312: glory of the torghast runner
[5:21:39] Bombayshow: why dont they just move the Island exp loot table to torghast everyone would be happy
[5:21:39] Unciatim: Yes.. there is Gear everywhere.... But it doesnt' fucking drop...
[5:21:40] toobaked1987: The reward is the power of our choice this xpac :D
[5:21:43] PvtHudson093: soul cinders to upgrade to r5 legendary
[5:21:45] mwchaos: yeah dude isnt soul ash / soul cinders enough? KEKW
[5:21:48] NovaSun84: get a title maybe?
[5:21:49] gurnt4: probably no deaths and clearning/finding everything
[5:21:49] ZeethianDragon: it's pointless torghast
[5:21:55] 91Niki: I mean, I wouldn't be mad if Torghast is purely like cosmetics / mounts / pets / titles. As long as it's something
[5:21:55] PidiaP: The reward is the friends we made along the way Kappa
[5:22:16] ZeethianDragon: Visions did it very right
[5:22:16] twistedstick1: towHi
[5:22:18] PvtHudson093: @91Niki which it was supposed to be
[5:22:24] Bombayshow: They made like 1k mog for the island expedition , everyone shat on it , I can tell they wont do it again
[5:22:25] SavageCheez: Is soul ash enough of a reward for the amount of time you spend in there?
[5:22:33] Holysal: and you could get a mount and the backpack
[5:22:36] 91Niki: As long as Torghast rewards are something you can take with you into the future of WoW, I'm fine with it. I guess
[5:22:37] warrenny: @pidiap The reward us the entitlement we earn along the way Kappa
[5:22:37] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:22:44] mrrazputin: Do we know by how much does 42 renown increase anima rewards ?
[5:22:45] ZeethianDragon: torghast looks up to visions as a role models
[5:22:46] Takinshotz: @Towelliee when next giveaway?
[5:22:49] NovaSun84: "The reward is the friends you make along the way :)" -- Queues solo for the 232nd time
[5:23:01] Wcvechten: Island mogs were in the game for years, they just finally were able to use it
[5:23:06] Bombayshow: They dont care about that I think , they only remember the worse
[5:23:16] lardris: lardris subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[5:23:26] ZeethianDragon: island has TONS of good mogs and cosmetics.  islands itself got nerfed which made it enjoyable
[5:23:33] 91Niki: I'd run Torghast all day if it gave mounts, pets, tmog, all that fun stuff .
[5:23:35] HawtPepperTuna: can't be sleeping on giveaways :(
[5:23:43] ArcaneSyntax: nobody liked islands the rewards were cool but islands were always shit.
[5:23:50] BlueBeast33: At least we're getting solo islands in 9.1
[5:23:50] wraaith: i was here but u didnt rig it so i won :(
[5:23:53] SavageCheez: Maybe they're waiting for mid 9.1 - 9.2 to release the goodies for Torghast
[5:23:57] ZeethianDragon: I loved the mass variety of different things you could get from islands, that needs to be done for Torghast
[5:23:58] SmokeBud24Seven: do u play classic?
[5:23:58] 91Niki: Torghast with Islands rewards
[5:24:00] warrenny: Dammit when im working üò≠
[5:24:13] 91Niki: So, hunger games ü§î
[5:24:21] NovaSun84: Sounds like Rust
[5:24:24] pj352: @ArcaneSyntax wtf dont speak for me i loved islands
[5:24:30] LecterSRK: i dont get why blizzard is so damn stingy with rewards this xpac especially. i really like getting loot even if i dont need it
[5:24:38] toobaked1987: Islands required 30 minutes of your time each week to complete the weekly, it gave it A LOT of azerite power and you could save dabloons for mounts and other rewards. The system overall was much much better.

[5:25:14] Bombayshow: toobaked1987 Still people didnt like it at the first patch so they mostly abandoned it
[5:26:01] toobaked1987: If youre unwilling to explore Blizzards updated  system, that is on the player, not the company.

[5:26:40] ArcaneSyntax: they abandoned islands because islands sucked, I did like 4 islands the entire expansion and hated them every time. idc about how good the reward were.
[5:26:50] pj352: @warrenny exactly pisses me off,they ruined the game
[5:26:50] neverbornlucky: Just what we need More Targas wings
