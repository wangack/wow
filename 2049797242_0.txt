[4:58:24] hidron99: @fabx0c there was a guy that felt he lived a whole different live with a new family and friends when he was high on salvia and he woke up he was shocked for months if not years

[5:00:42] Polarmensch: thats actually pretty stupid LUL
[5:00:47] TempzTea: seqThink
[5:00:53] ugunskrusts: thats not correct
[5:01:02] triplerainday: 1
[5:01:09] ugunskrusts: this changes everything
[5:01:12] ZetItUp: so that actually makes it 30% chance that you will get rain?
[5:01:12] Polarmensch: i mean why call it a chance when they are talking about an area
[5:01:14] ugunskrusts: for fishing success
[5:01:28] kylEH_: why does the energy timer glow green at half way?
[5:01:36] Polarmensch: 30% chance amongst all ppl living there LUL
[5:01:41] rodavlasilad: Percentage = Confidence x Area, or P = C x A.'
[5:01:41] struci: OMEGALUL they should add that to every weather forecast like a pharmaceutical ad
[5:01:42] theodorn88: fishing is better in the rain homie
[5:01:43] foxxys856: nope its 30% of the area i thought this was common knowledge but alot ppl didnt know
[5:01:44] struci: something like "A forecast indicating a 30% chance of rain applies to the general area and may not specifically include your exact location. Weather patterns can be unpredictable, and localized conditions may vary significantly. Always prepare for varying weather conditions, regardless of general forecasts, to ensure your safety and comfort. This message is brought to you by the weather forecasting service committed to keeping you informed with the most accurate and up-to-date weather informatio
[5:01:48] Baumboll: u can look the weather forecast up in a certain location, and it can even say literally that the chanse of rain in this specific area is a certain %.
[5:01:57] struci: YAPPP
[5:02:01] ugunskrusts: actually, yeah, 30% chance isnt that, it will not rain at all, or rain in small area, i dont think it covers that large area, but i will check it
[5:02:27] foxxys856: yes that is correct
[5:02:29] elessar_jk2: wait really?
[5:02:34] iamrkoev: 42% chance of fog
[5:02:38] ugunskrusts: gotta ask metereologists, what are the area sizes
[5:02:44] Polarmensch: to me its always 50%
[5:02:44] Vetto_7: I love how my joke turned into debate KEKL
[5:02:47] Polarmensch: it either rains
[5:02:49] Polarmensch: or it doesnt
[5:02:54] LueDawg: correct
[5:02:58] LueDawg: the forecasted area
[5:02:59] elessar_jk2: but what are the odds/percentage that that 30% of the area that will experience rain will experience rain?
[5:03:06] ugunskrusts: this is some mind-blowing news
[5:03:08] Leadstar1212: KEKW
[5:03:10] iamrkoev: @elessar_jk2 about 15%
[5:03:12] Baumboll: Streamer repeats same false statement several times and makes sure he believes himself xD
[5:03:31] rodavlasilad: Percentage = Confidence x Area. It's not just the area like you're implying, and its not just the confidence like many people assume. @PsheroTV

[5:03:52] bakerpls: he is right.
[5:03:58] elessar_jk2: and streamer just eats whole stream and gets called fatty at the end of it lmao
[5:04:03] insanic_3: he is right you know
[5:04:03] ugunskrusts: it's so funny, talk about meteorology
[5:04:09] oh_sht_das_me: this is a very simple concept to understand tbh. Not sure how anyone is confused
[5:04:16] struci: UHM that explanation did not match yours
[5:04:21] Baumboll: "If we are 100% certain it will rain..."
[5:04:24] Baumboll: Which they never are
[5:04:25] rodavlasilad: @PsheroTV RIGHT ITS MULTIPLIED. So if they were 50% sure and its going to cover 50% of the area then its a 25% chance of rain
[5:04:31] struci: so the certainty times the expected area is the percentage given
[5:04:52] Baumboll: Well they never are 100% ceratin
[5:04:55] pengwin06: like my area says it will rain, until 2am, then resume on 5am and it was spot on
[5:04:56] elessar_jk2: what about chemtrails tho? how do they account for that?
[5:04:59] Polarmensch: i think we can all agree on that weather forecasts are worth a peanut
[5:05:05] Vetto_7: sometimes it never rains on the place it should rain
[5:05:11] ZetItUp: people don't understand what you are saying
[5:05:22] RastislavConka: what geopolitical issue are we discussing today @PsheroTV
[5:05:30] struci: it could also be 30% certainty that 100% of the area gets coverage
[5:05:33] rodavlasilad: any meteoroligists in the chat
[5:05:33] elessar_jk2: i dont understand why they're called intense purposes :/
[5:05:34] bakerpls: @elessar_jk2 "captain, flick the chemtrail switch."

[6:09:55] cripples42069: @Silkynoodle stv event. FFA
[6:10:00] krontos7717: Which nerfs coming for rogues?
[6:10:19] pew2700: IF and big If the data mine comes true rogue is in a really rough spot in pvp.  not surprising considering Aggrend hates hated rogues
[6:10:42] Silkynoodle: i mean they finally get their actual stunlock kit
[6:10:53] Silkynoodle: not really rune related
[6:11:11] pew2700: And it’s still gonna be completely useless unless your prepping every kill
[6:11:32] Silkynoodle: in vanilla who is king of pvp? warrioirs?
[6:11:39] stalkerbronet: warlock in 1v1
[6:11:39] christiangodwarrior97: @pew2700 wtf datamines did u read. rogue looked absolutely busted
[6:12:08] stalkerbronet: rogue will always be strong u can stun ppl for 10 sec
[6:12:08] big_lebowski_69: rogues will be totally op
[6:12:09] Silkynoodle: said might get shadow step
[6:12:58] Kpaxlol: u watching the previous leaks ?
[6:13:01] cookieforu: p2 will prob be much less accurate
[6:13:02] Silkynoodle: yeah
[6:13:19] pew2700: It’s not what rogues got it’s what others are getting and then on top of that you will have Laps ANd the retail version of the trinket..
[6:13:20] cripples42069: @cookieforu i think they added extra stuff to throw people off
[6:13:21] cookieforu: way too many runes got leaked am 100% sure they wont make it all

[6:15:18] pew2700: Rogues will open,  lap will be used.  you’ll have to vanish,  and reopen when lap ends, and then they’ll trinket the next stun, since everyone will now have the ability to trinket stun, and then your in a situation of trying to damage down, or prep vanish for another stun lock opener
[6:15:36] pew2700: If mage gets displacement, that’s 3 blinks lol
