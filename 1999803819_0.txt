[1:31:34] ballysha: NotLikeThis
[1:31:37] runjab: the fact yo cant rejoin a match kills this game for me
[1:31:44] Kintrai: it blows my mind that they nerfed basically NOTHING from heavy on release

[1:31:54] KontrolStyle: yeah it's just the fov was 110
[1:31:57] CodeCrisp: nothing
[1:31:58] KontrolStyle: now it's 100 so it feels slower
[1:32:00] ReleNtless1g: They admitted there was an issue though?
[1:32:00] Maluco_Doido: They are trying to figure out why people are dumb KEKW
[1:32:04] TheAverageDes: the map might be a bit too big

[1:32:14] sugoimm: slower than the beta?
[1:32:14] WebbzyJR: !rank
[1:32:17] JCerris: @jbroba gas is pretty good too, melts hp
[1:32:17] aChatterBot: I think people with high ping are review bombing because the game feels exactly the same.
[1:32:18] Protomateria: @Kintrai they giga nerfed the flamethrower, that was really the only outlier. tbh i was kinda surprised they didnt nerf the mesh shield, but it melts if people focus it
[1:32:19] Awa11s: fov , pov maybe
[1:32:20] KontrolStyle: @Kintrai, shroud's command had it at 110
[1:32:20] paankol: !thefinalssens
[1:32:20] klado0: pistol cracked
[1:32:20] Fossabot: @paankol His sens for The Finals is 40
[1:32:22] NateDee_: seagull thinks that it's because the new install reset everyone's FOV which makes it feel slower
[1:32:24] GunzGames: I think its just a giant placebo effect and people just wana be mad @shroud
[1:32:27] KontrolStyle: so i beg to differ

[1:36:31] Roelyyyn: @achatterbot i dont think new players would be able to compare how it felt before, maybe im missing your point
[1:36:33] cudatooth: Hyperscape was TERRIBLE
[1:36:34] Protomateria: yeah dash is insane
[1:36:35] ChefYoo: i mean, medium gets wall hacks
[1:36:36] hypnotix_live: the dash is dog water
[1:36:37] Ascending2: @PseudoChuckle light has 150hp and rpg top damage is 180, so yes they still get one-shot
[1:36:40] Kintrai: invis with double barrel is pretty busted ngl

[1:57:11] Protomateria: @SlickWillLay wdym? the day before is out in early access and its a dumpster fire
[1:57:12] famewxlf: @jcap28 if you're losing to light as medium it just means you're missing tbh
[1:57:14] Mukstar: is the concept of your game and extraction shooter @shroud?
[1:57:14] joshnut: Nice ugly sweater shroudY
[1:57:14] neildeg: do you have a picture of the iron man?

[1:57:49] Hydid: is there any trailer out? @shroud
[1:57:49] neildeg: have you played valheim?
[1:57:50] machriphi: @truiso It's fun, damage is good, but the slower rate of fire, low clip size, longer reload speed all makes it less balanced than running an AR. If you're playing at mid range and hitting headies it can melt, but if you miss even a shot or two you lost the fight
[1:57:51] QueenDampi: The fuck is this outfit? LUL
[1:57:51] deagle535: yo shroud have you tried sawned shotgun and invis? its the best at the moment for light
[1:57:52] dreamnesiaaa: @shroud can u show updated settings

[2:00:29] machriphi: @thriscucker You don't really have that opportunity in ranked. People are on an objective, indoors, behind a Rein shield and dome. Same reason why snipers are trash outside of pup stomping.
[2:00:36] AFKin: @AFKin Everything is reset, they gave you money just to test thing i assume
[2:00:37] yourboyvoldemort: the revolver claps

[2:38:13] KontrolStyle: YEP
[2:38:15] RevenantNeverDies2009: @BakinPacman amazing concept, like maybe with variable zoom scope attachments, you could have to hold down a button or sequence of them to focus or steady the weapon so you become more accurate
[2:38:16] FSOC1ETY_: wish they changed that red screen tho hurting my eyes KEKW

[2:39:05] vivecx: red dot for the ak would be nice
[2:39:05] cameykael: 0.
[2:39:09] aChatterBot: They might rotate which is the best class in the future
[2:39:10] xMychal: @ItzEvilEyes no but solo q can get old real quick

[2:39:34] jewfest: it should headshot kill small and medium
[2:39:35] BakinPacman: then you get to the point of if a sniper can one shot why is a rpg in the game LUL

[2:40:33] RevenantNeverDies2009: Earlier when i joined this stream like 15 min ago some kid was complaining about shroud "smurfing and then getting 4th place" and then when i explain to them that they do NOT know what theyre talking about and to let streamer play for fun, they start insulting me and calling me names over it in chat LOL
[2:40:37] MadWitchy: lmao
[2:40:38] ippoPT: @ozmoslice what do you mean I’m talking about the game itself not them. I would do the same they’re doing but it’s weird how can you win a game with hardly killing anyone it’s a shooter after all
[2:40:40] cappzap: @AdAstruh they don't provide close to as much utility and value as med and heavy
[2:40:41] Wrekineyez: Hit the wrong vent KEKW
[2:40:46] fernandez1000: @lecordonb1eu gladly bro KEKW
[2:40:48] w33zzy: game has great visuals wonder what they gonna add to this game
[2:40:51] RevenantNeverDies2009: you need more chat mods
[2:40:51] About36Ounces: Light class w double barrel or pistol & constant movement/rotation is beautiful

[2:41:03] revesting: dash feels good
[2:41:10] Nomnomperson: damn nearly
[2:41:10] cappzap: @xMychal it's viable with good teamplay but its still the worst class. meta is HMM and HHM
[2:41:13] TheGothic13: What about snipers on this game?
[2:41:15] pistolerox99: Kaboom
[2:41:17] fernandez1000: @Nomnomperson what did they change excatly ?
[2:41:24] FlickerRB: knives better with cloak
[2:41:34] Honeycrispie: light so bad xdd
[2:41:35] Kojikorma: why no game soundfs
[2:41:40] doomdez: sheesh tho
[2:41:42] AdAstruh: @cappzap the flash, pyro nade and the smoke has been the best combo for me.
[2:41:43] burgxrz: lol
[2:41:46] jefelands: wish console had this type of movement fr
[2:41:49] MMaRsu: @kojikorma ?
[2:41:52] mfz09: can u dash on any weight?
[2:41:53] holymary1: @fernandez1000 only animations according to shroud
[2:41:56] RevenantNeverDies2009: @TheGothic13 apparently they suck because the devs ruined the damage on them for "balance" so unfortuneately its no longer a fun choice :(
[2:41:58] xMychal: @cappzap theyre meant to get in and out of fights to melt people quick, they like shine off of fast, solo oriented game play and have their team capitilize off of it
[2:41:59] BEALSKY: lmao console LUL
[2:41:59] cappzap: @AdAstruh try glitch nade, it's really good
[2:42:00] 11STAPLE11: the goatee has returned

[2:42:16] cappzap: @xMychal thats why i said with good teamplay
[2:42:21] NBoi56: what if snipers needed to charge up shots, and dealt more damage, would they be balanced then? think widowmaker or triple take ish
[2:42:23] Ti_Lur: FOR SURE

[2:42:29] burgxrz: @jefelands turn sensitivity up you’ll get closer to this
[2:42:33] Nomnomperson: @Nomnomperson mostly UI fixes today, also first person sprint animations. If you're talking about NEW things in the game, you need to read the patch notes on the website, there's a lot of new things
[2:42:35] yixophoenix: this game has been so much more unstable on live compared to beta at least for me
[2:42:41] MadWitchy: maybe a grenade to throw for faster regen or something
[2:42:43] LocknLoad_Gamin: yo
[2:42:44] fernandez1000: @holymary1 ahhh okk thats cool
[2:42:47] lllLotus: @kademz22 It was 132 and you can feel 100+ frame drops
[2:42:47] mathiscayou: then we can make heavy regen slowen to balance
[2:42:52] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[2:42:52] Nateinthehouse: How many games until ranked?
[2:42:52] BakinPacman: what about a faster first 50% and slows as it gets near top hp
[2:42:56] crisspx: @yixophoenix pc skill issue
[2:42:58] RevenantNeverDies2009: @revesting it would be in any game lol imagine getting to stun someone and then give them 12 gauge to the skull
[2:43:01] Roelyyyn: @ippopt kills give money and in order to win they have to cash in the money, which they dont do. thats why they have so many kills and dont win.
[2:43:01] btran565: @yixophoenix launch day was rough but feels fine now to me

[4:17:52] Zoun19: ai will streamline it, won't affect creativity too much. Creativity will be there when it exists
[4:17:53] darknight602: @UncleKappa69 lock your frames to your refresh rate
[4:17:53] drypeeks: I think AI, procedural generation, and machine learning are all different tools that can and should be used together
[4:17:54] hghwalk: I mean, if you knew anything about AI you'd know a ton of artist are actually suing AI art programs because the art used other artists art to learn from and now can recreate their styles, this putting them out of work/generating their exact work

[4:18:18] hghwalk: It would be cool if yknow, ai could do something useful, that humans DONT want to do

[4:27:34] Koloballs: @venox1337 1 thing make sense, shroud playing 1440p

[4:27:45] catchqt: mekatarina
[4:27:46] szatanthc: from what he got this "short revolver"???????????
[4:27:51] Kekker_: @Venox1337 if the game is CPU limited, then it could make sense. If you're working with a 4090 you're def not bottlenecked by that, so it might be your CPU that's the issue
[4:27:53] Horrible2Kill_Gaming: All pc's are different ,and components etc,so theoretically its possible to have different performance and resolution asswell
[4:27:54] PizzaE: @poeya1 this game is fun casuals, but there's no esports scene or prize pool. This game isn't going to last a few years. Players are just exhausted with competitive games these days

[4:28:32] battlefield20421: is this game going to make profit since its free

[4:29:13] Kekker_: @vvrucebayne Given the destruction and all the physics shit going on, I believe this^. But you should also know that mem leaks are 100% a game issue and not a PC issue
[4:29:14] meechall: such a great foundation of game and gameplay i look forward to the future of this franchise i bet they could really make it epic with this maps and mechanics etc

[4:30:09] vvrucebayne: @vvrucebayne mem leaks can be created in any software, some other program can be causing it

[4:30:11] Fincher07: pog
[4:30:14] Venox1337: @Kekker_ im also not comparing it to my performance. but his performance to shrouds. so keep that in mind

[4:30:41] PizzaE: @Loop3r its not as bad in game
[4:30:45] Kekker_: @Venox1337 I would expect Shroud to have DLSS off, which would have a massive performance hit
[4:30:46] holymary1: Engine Unreal Engine

[4:32:23] 1up030: is this ranked or still unranked?
[4:32:25] Kekker_: @Venox1337 Not really sure what you mean by that. Are there multiple upscaling options? If there is, and DLSS isn't the one shroud picked, then that's an even bigger performance hit. Upscaling is hella expensive

[4:38:14] LCTR_: DLSS latency is in the 'not noticeable by humans' territory
[4:38:18] polarbeerrs: how many game until ranked ?
[4:38:18] Venox1337: @hghwalk the guy in chat says he has pretty much the same performance as shroud with worse hardware and higher settings. its just cap

[4:38:40] AutomataOG: DLSS set to quality looks perfect to me in this game. Frame gen is iffy
[4:38:42] vvrucebayne: the difference between 1440p and 1080p, plus using a different upscaling than shroud is how im getting roughly the same performance
[4:38:45] Phonoss: what option should be enabled?
[4:38:47] CyberFizzz: is there ranked

[4:39:03] anime_is_reaI: @shroud can you explain the rules to a nooobie?
[4:39:05] Kekker_: @LCTR_ That's fair, but it's enough to make many people turn it off anyways. The conversation was trying to figure out performance problems, and using TAAU upscaling might result in lower FPS
