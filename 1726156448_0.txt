[5:02:24] Xaositex: It procs a buff based on the element of the gem itself, it says what kind of element in description
[5:02:35] Seikishidan_: but that neck will go to 424 in pvp, lariat with infusion goes to 405 ilvl
[5:03:04] Tukkdin: wiat
[5:03:16] Pallyofhell: yea
[5:03:21] Seikishidan_: yes that rdf infusion just nails 405
[5:03:24] Pallyofhell: i got a craft weapon thats 405 right now
[5:03:28] Pallyofhell: soon to be 415
[5:03:48] BoricuaSJ: did you see the new gems coming along.. https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/71102-primordial-gems-in-patch-1007/

[5:03:57] Seikishidan_: enter the item and it lets you choose the infusion
[5:03:59] Seikishidan_: there it says
[5:04:07] Pallyofhell: you just get it crafted at 415 ilvl
[5:04:07] newkingcody: use your primal infusion on the boots
[5:04:21] newkingcody: dont forget to insert primal infuison
[5:04:35] Tukkdin: are you not gonna use that primal on your boots to make it 405?
[5:04:50] Seikishidan_: and then one of those gems going to be 60k qq

[5:06:21] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
