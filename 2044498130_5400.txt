[2:05:20] Ahkrael: as a tank, even if he DID do it right, sunder and HS can be parried/dodged
[2:05:28] Ahkrael: so its bad form for DPS to open on the boss like that
[2:05:29] lilpaulyg: idk del does nothing for 4 sec
[2:05:31] lilpaulyg: cause he played badly
[2:05:34] Galoots_: first hit important for threat isnt it?

[2:06:08] retau_: no auto is brutal
[2:06:15] scarlboro: i swear he doesn't have a start attack in his abilities or something lol
[2:06:16] Ahkrael: the boss hitting him gives him the rage to actually do shit
[2:06:17] IHBCI: @bean can we recap this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WOsP2JgbLk ?
[2:06:18] scarlboro: + a weapon swap
