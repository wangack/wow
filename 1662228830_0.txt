[4:47:31] manmower: paladin has so much utility that they probably lost utility with new talent system
[4:47:42] Cabbageman007: What are some Survival items all Toons should have lvling in DF?
[4:47:46] skdmaster: Do you think BrM will get better once they get some gear or are they a lost cause at the moment?

[4:48:18] Shrenko: I would only change main if they made achievement progress and reputation accound wide... WHY BLIZZ WHY
[4:48:20] captain_khyzan: @Towelliee bear needs a vine grip! (pull like DK's)
[4:48:34] LancerVI: Bear better party healer than Prot Pally now? xD
[4:48:42] jabi31420: Lol
[4:48:58] thiccsushi: Recruitie counts as 3 boomies
[4:48:58] NickLeonhearth: We boomking pass on the intervate to resto druids thank you
[4:49:00] bosseja: Is blood dk better then pally? @towelliee
[4:49:04] havoom01: just remoove all utility for all classes,then MAYBE all classes will have same priority to be invited..no group utility no invite thats so lame
[4:49:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Free healz
[4:49:11] TompsonX: prot pally heals passively tho
[4:49:20] TompsonX: doesn't use anything either?
[4:49:27] ShinyLox: I love the lighting!

[4:49:55] Holyman22: When do drops start? Sorry if dumb question
[4:49:56] TompsonX: modzTHINK
[4:50:13] captain_khyzan: after seeing paladin get battle rez i really thought bear would get vine grip... much sadness
[4:50:14] TompsonX: I'm not sure that's why I was asking. when I did a dungeon the other day all I had was judgemnet of light and I basically outhealed the healer
[4:50:21] xchaoskingsx: @TompsonX Show us on the doll where druid tank touched you LUL
[4:50:22] Shrenko: @Holyman22 28 nov
[4:50:36] Holyman22: oo so launch thing

[4:50:55] Holyman22: @Shrenko thanks man
[4:50:56] TheItalianStallion321: @TompsonX was it a heroic dungeon? definitely was not a m+ dungeon. and if so, your healer was garbage

[4:51:28] TompsonX: @TompsonX It was only like a +10, so maybe the healer was bad, I honestly don't know
[4:51:39] subluxt7: Unicorn comp
[4:51:45] ZiggySalvation: Do you think warrior will be viable and game
[4:51:46] LancerVI: Captain Planet party

[4:52:53] Wardem0n: how long do ya think it'll take to level 60-70?
[4:52:59] yogibearz: @ZiggySalvation ? they were king all bfa long
[4:52:59] Ghunthor: i could never keep agro on a warr tank
[4:53:06] ZiggySalvation: Hugely nerfed yea
[4:53:08] TheItalianStallion321: ok so 2 prot warriors for world 1st? got it lol

[4:54:45] ZiggySalvation: I’ve been really excited about tanking warr this year
[4:54:49] Shrenko: they need to do something with hunter next
[4:54:57] manmower: probably will buff prot war dmg
[4:55:02] ZiggySalvation: I still feel like we’re gonna be edged out by bear dk and dh
[4:55:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: They should buff Brewmaster toughness more

[4:56:06] Masqerader: *tears
[4:56:14] TompsonX: What would the easiest DPS be?
[4:56:21] TompsonX: I've never played DPS or healer
[4:56:26] TompsonX: So I would like to start with an easy one
[4:56:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: There will be malding if people have to level something else because the meta shifted
[4:56:38] Jollywhompus: not enough tanks to be picky tho if you arent playing warrior youl lbe fine
[4:56:41] paulson14: hunter
[4:56:47] ItsTrevway: they need to nerf DH in pvp
[4:56:50] Zilberg: Finally the warriors don't suck!
[4:56:55] Lorilath: I just leveled a warrior tank and it felt really good playing it be interesting to see how they nerf it
[4:56:56] abracka_: S1 DF warrior giga chad tank, by 10.1 they'll be nerfed into the ground so badly that nobody touches it

[4:57:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: They dropped the ball not having a tank spec for Dracthyr
[4:57:49] bosseja: I play tanks bc it makes me play more and wait less

[4:57:57] MILESkg21: Molvonos pre patch
[4:57:58] zeeAbe: There will always be shortage of tanks due to how the role operates and how hard it is to find raiding guilds as a tank. 20% of M+ group composition is a tank, while 20 player raiding group only needs 10% to be tanks etc.
[4:58:01] kaeltho: Im swapping to healer this xpac
[4:58:11] jason_tacey: Any evoker healers enjoying healing spec of Evoker?
[4:58:15] Zilberg: I love tanking personally.. but I always have had that leadershiip mentality
[4:58:17] CujoAttacks: I tank for my guild all the time, I refuse to tank pugs. People suck lol
[4:58:17] chipotlesquirts: it's sad, all of my friends who are picking up wow for the new xpac want to tank, they start RDF leveling though and get flamed to the point they stop
[4:58:20] Molvonos: @MilesKG21 I knew I wasn't that far behind, jeeze.  That's pretty nice tho
[4:58:28] stabzmcgeee: @wEiRdO_dUdE every new class added to wo has had a tank spec!!!
[4:58:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: They got their raid healer, and like they said the raids have plenty of tanks since there's only 2 spots....but dungeons are the issue
[4:58:46] MILESkg21: Molvonos that thing is gonna be lifesaver for most
[4:58:58] thiccsushi: is it worse than siege of boralus?
[4:59:13] Zilberg: I actually like that dungeon
[4:59:24] OldDirtyDaz: what add on gives the circle around your cursor?
