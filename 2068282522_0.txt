[5:10:15] ithen7: @Ziqoftw How would you explain lack of interest for Wrath amongs most streamers? Is it cause of new thing hype or just it is dead cause wrath seems more balanced xpac?

[7:26:09] hiro25000: @combo0133 Nothing to do with boomers. Boomers were born in the sixties by the way. It has to do with visibility. If the end game is only comprehensible by 5% of the player base, game is not in good shape for tournaments or new players
[7:26:17] COMMEdesRATS: @hivemindqt it's the same 6 player for 6 rounds
[7:26:22] combo0133: @carepichamvp dude, theres soo much more to it in retail though. no arenas in classic and you know that stop trolling

[8:12:22] Kimack: you look back at it like "ah good times" but you were frustrated as fuck in the moment
[8:12:34] ethanjh90: my pc could barely play D2

[8:14:21] morrs: I completely disagree - Their best quest are the end content. And my argument was Legion or WoD - insane quests
[8:14:22] kusoneko: NUMBER GOES UP POGGERS
[8:14:23] daltine: then its beryu boring
[8:14:24] lbadwithnames: Big number Pog
[8:14:32] Shirey12: Man I would love to play classic again but there's so many problems. 3 Major issues. 1). Botting, 2). Economy, 3). Gold Buying. When I played with a GDKP on Whitemane-US. I saw a Gressil off Kel'Thuzad sell for 3 times the gold cap. (214k gold is gold cap per toon). If they add a gold sink I would love to play it again.

[8:15:11] phnx2k: @BDMMatt99 yes, send it all to me and i can safely dispose of it
[8:15:24] F1owzen: retail is just abundance of everything which is boring
[8:15:25] nutclop: scaling ruins it imo
[8:15:34] MrPankratz: yup
[8:15:35] jallaballan: you can feel enchants in classic
[8:15:44] MrPankratz: true

[8:16:17] MrPankratz: +1 strength sword
[8:16:22] Paayne_Music: same when you get stamina, you feel like a tank
[8:16:22] addyz0r: the game is so slow and dangerous that it matters. nothing matters in retail until full bis
[8:16:22] body_type_two: payoWow
[8:16:28] Nonprophetx: yep, first green weapons you get is night and day
[8:16:28] hotmanpop: your first blue is Kreygasm
[8:16:29] darsoldis: The first green is so euphoric
[8:16:33] morrs: Retail is about the end content - interesting quests, lore etc. In general Retail is better
[8:16:36] magickdoge: OOOO 700crit
[8:16:44] Widd: noticed it a lot on my mage. didnt die the next time after equipping that 1 green

[8:17:08] KalmBeforeSomr: @morrs COPIUM
[8:17:14] Shirey12: Retail is good but I see your point. But it's a different game to compare. In retail you feel the difference from normal gear to heroic and getting into +20s. The chance is noticable.
[8:17:18] Widd: FirstTimeChatter
[8:17:23] shurublues: Weapon upgrades felt amazing

[8:19:24] Shirey12: atleast in retail you don't have RMT issues. WoW token solves economy and provides an extra gold sink
[8:19:53] morrs: and btw Retail's pvp is waaay better, Retail's raids are waaay better too, Retail's rotation and complexity is way more interesting too ...
[8:19:59] Kimack: the most cringe way to complain about something:
[8:20:01] Disemble: it def feels to slow
[8:20:03] Shirey12: @morrs agreed
[8:20:32] laito_: retail is more like disney than wow nowadays

[8:22:32] Shirey12: @morrs because people buying gold in the 2019 relaunch ruined the game with GDKPs
[8:22:43] Keelhhein: @msgmag Stop ignoring the problem, it makes me realise it's true. Here, i said what you wanted to say
[8:22:46] shmokindoink: are GDKPs banned in all versions of WoW or just SOD?
[8:22:52] Damagedom: Or farm pvp gear and bait people with high GS
[8:22:53] cozenn: nerds attached to full bis is so lame the game isnt that hard

[8:24:26] morrs: Pos FoS and the orher one I forgot it's name
[8:24:29] miniRoach: if you miss the wave, it's annoying to catch up
[8:24:35] Shirey12: I repeat. 3 issues with classic 1). Economy, 2). Botting, 3). RMT.
[8:24:39] crocopuffe: you ding 80 and you go Fos Pos spam YEP
[8:24:43] sm0ke_ggz: I loved WOTLK so much imo was the best
[8:24:51] mealtiime: but that is why there are gamma dungeons though
[8:24:51] Kroski: @Shirey12 RMT and botting are basically the same issue
[8:24:54] Iol69: new players should know that smh noobs
[8:24:54] mealtiime: for catch up
[8:25:01] laito_: @Shirey12 game works like a mobile grinding simlator since wod, they even launched a mobile app for it
[8:25:11] Shirey12: @Kroski RMT is not the same as botting.
[8:25:32] Icekx: he looks like the weatherman of wow
[8:25:32] lil__dolo: classic Andy
[8:25:33] wowsuomi: Starting off later in wrath u can skip a lot to get leveled
[8:25:33] Kroski: @Shirey12 Botting is a direct result of RMT so both are basically the same problem
[8:25:43] evermanq111: what is this site that shows bis ?
[8:25:45] Shirey12: @laito_ You don't play retail I can see. Just same Game Bad just like the rest of the mindless wow bashers.

[8:26:40] RonWilson: the game is getting r1 in pvp and winning in r1 mmr
[8:26:45] RonWilson: change my mind
[8:26:53] morrs: This guy should do pvp and try to say that again. Ofc playing vs the AI is like that even in hcs. As ppl here mentioned GDKP is a problem and that is sadly complicated
[8:26:53] Da5tupid1: Sadge
[8:27:09] morrs: I guess we just got old ... and kinda ruined the game
[8:27:20] magickdoge: KEKZ Inflation

[8:29:43] Releaserage: 1v5 arcane mage world pvp EZ
[8:29:44] Shirey12: @laito_ you are bashing the SAME title. You are creating a twitch argument like you are right.
[8:29:50] TheNutcracka: legion was the expension where i fell in love with arenas
[8:29:51] Vir0n: W OMEGALUL D
[8:29:51] hotmanpop: just skip cata, mop and wod
[8:29:54] vaetuu: legion was a grindfest lmfao
[8:30:03] n0ll4n: legion was great
[8:30:10] Kirby_The_Pink: Aware
[8:30:27] carnnezz: retail = arcade game
[8:30:30] morrs: @vaetuu that is also true, but the story, quests, raids, hell even music, each zone ... just pure masterpiece
[8:30:31] laito_: @Shirey12 the same can be said to you LUL
[8:30:39] vaetuu: @morrs yeah it was good
[8:30:45] kredes_: hate that scaling
[8:30:48] Kimack: zoomers dont talk to eachother, in any game
[8:30:52] lumisca: Only addons using chat in retail
[8:31:06] magickdoge: This is so true, I hate this part of retail
[8:31:11] addyz0r: so true
[8:31:14] addyz0r: it's the same
[8:31:16] F1owzen: This guy makes me realize there's so much wrong with retail
[8:31:16] darsoldis: Single player hack n smash, even at max leveling you're just queing into groups with people you'll never see again
[8:31:17] Gurttastic: Dynamic mob/quest levels were a mistake.
[8:31:23] morrs: Like in legion - 1 week I had to be fire mage haha next arcane then frost ... and grind the artifact but I kinda forgive them about that. It was fun
[8:31:41] supatease: blizzard spent the last 3 expansions catering to people who want a better "solo player" experience so no wonder

[8:32:26] laito_: @Shirey12 I cannot believe you've played wow since the first expansions and praise retail for what its.
[8:32:35] darsoldis: If you want solo content play Skyrim
[8:32:39] MrPankratz: @Shirey12 and that's the point, the game dont even push you to do that
[8:32:43] rekarthbarb: retail is for sweatmode and dress-up simulation, classic is for the rpg experience
[8:32:46] jallaballan: how much is sw death hitting for now?
[8:32:54] worldofwokecraft: Can we like jsut get Legion classic after Cata and not even bother going with WoD and MoP /
