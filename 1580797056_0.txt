[0:32:47] vizmaior: Thanks, you mean old without all the extra complicated stuff I am experiencing now? I don‚Äôt remember the game being so overwhelming as it is in shadowlands. I just started playing again a few days ago.
[0:32:51] RastaDino: cat on keyboard, sorry that that
[0:33:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: 25 yard range is interesting
[0:33:15] ArnesMeyer: @sheepdawg_ again canceled?
[0:33:26] Kareshkah: Blizzard gonna fix it now üò≠
[0:33:31] sheepdawg_: leaks
[0:33:47] Bitterbarno: @vizmaior on the classic clients you'll be playing on the old patches, albeit i think with very slight quality of life changes
[0:34:12] kimohunt: @wEiRdO_dUdE well, Evoker can't outrange that KEKW
[0:34:14] laundrevity: can ambition 2 chest this 30?
[0:34:29] tucafffreitas: ^^
[0:34:30] Hugejorma: Any idea how Blizzard picks new old dungeons for M+? I'm just waiting for Freehold. It was super fun in BFA :)
[0:34:30] Hastif: @laundrevity 3 chst for sure
[0:34:38] ArnesMeyer: 3 chest
[0:34:38] logicaltty: they can 3 chest it
[0:34:45] YEGIGACHAD: pve andy DansGame
[0:35:01] hokagejones: @Hugejorma they put it to a community vote for this season
[0:35:03] vizmaior: Thank you guys for answering, I appreciate the knowledge.
[0:35:07] kimohunt: @Hugejorma ? there is no picks anymore. shadowlands season 4 was probably an execption XD
[0:35:08] elhanchoow: +40 lol nah
[0:35:16] bramwow: 37
[0:35:22] Madalynn: What dungeon are the bottom two teams doing ?
[0:35:26] raikoneN_: gobba is the cap
[0:35:27] Ghamera: Trog boss charged slam will limit the key
[0:35:27] SycNasty: Freehold is a trash dungeon. I don‚Äôt get the hype.
[0:35:28] elhanchoow: they will do 38
[0:35:33] Unholytree: @kimohunt They're doing the same for Dragonflight
[0:35:34] bramwow: grivious will hurt
[0:35:35] ArnesMeyer: lol 40
[0:35:39] Aurhora3: @Madalynn streets
[0:35:40] huatal: wait i thought its capped? did they increase the keylevel?
[0:35:41] hokagejones: @Madalynn tazavesh streets
[0:35:42] logicaltty: @Madalynn streets
[0:35:43] LittleBigSteve: @Madalynn Streets of Wonder
[0:35:48] prkr_ae: @kimohunt they're doing it every season in dragonflight
[0:35:54] elhanchoow: @huatal yes uncapped now
[0:35:56] the_jeffmeister: isnt it capped at 35?
[0:35:56] Madalynn: Ok thanks chat
[0:35:58] sheepdawg_: i hope tomorrow is GRIMRAIL DEPOT lmao
[0:36:05] ArnesMeyer: king gobbamak will 1 shot in +37
[0:36:10] kimohunt: @Unholytree really? didnt have info LUL
[0:36:10] Smasher225: Did they fix the plus 35 limit?
[0:36:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Awesome
[0:36:11] raikoneN_: they did 35 tyranical pretty smoothly, on fort they will do a 38 at least
[0:36:16] SycNasty: Freehold is trash
[0:36:17] Moobot: AWC schedule: https://worldofwarcraft.com/esports/schedule | MDI schedule: https://twitter.com/WoWEsports/status/1546554921209798662
[0:36:32] Trellsky: echo's boss bugged
[0:36:35] Hugejorma: @SycNasty It was fun for higher keys... So open for skips and what to do LUL
[0:36:39] PersianWOW: did bliz made a teams introduction clips or not?
[0:36:43] AntedAP: what was happening with echo?
[0:36:45] huatal: @huatal oh nice
[0:36:52] SycNasty: Terrible dungeon.
[0:36:56] Lukasgate: Looks like it bugged when clickz died
[0:36:59] vizmaior: So to get ‚Äúkeys‚Äù you select the difficult level or you got to run the dungeon ‚Äúx‚Äù amount of times? So if I wanted to play +30 key level I have to run that dungeon 30 times?
[0:37:32] huatal: @vizmaior it starts at 26
[0:37:48] SycNasty: What‚Äôs the point of a dungeon if you skip 90% of it?
[0:37:57] lovelywaz: Don't they also skip an infiltrator inside the cave near Zul in Gambit? That would make it 4 stacks in total actually ü§î
[0:37:58] ArnesMeyer: yards start from +30
[0:38:04] Im_anDe: @SycNasty freehold was definitely not perfect, but the trash was fun, the pulls were flexible, and the dungeon layout was great (imo at least)
[0:38:04] bramwow: junkyard starts at 30
[0:38:06] hokagejones: @vizmaior no, you get higher level keys of a random dungeon by completing a mythic, based on how quick you are determines if you get a key +3, +2, or +1
[0:38:17] Ghamera: omg echos pull
[0:38:19] Ali1331: Generally keys start at 2, in this tournament they‚Äôre starting at 26-30. Completing it in time, increases its level by one, doing it faster can increase by 2/3
[0:38:19] Lukasgate: You cant skip 90% of a dungeon there is trash count.....
[0:38:22] logicaltty: @vizmaior you start with a +2 key and if you beat it in time you get a +3 key, etc. but if you finish fast enough you can push it up 2 or 3 levels at a time
[0:38:55] Ali1331: What are monka doing
[0:38:58] Hephistos: Moad just died twice but only 1 death counter, why?
[0:38:58] Ghamera: Echo did all the cats with the dino with 3 infilitrators
[0:38:59] Dank1116: monka making mistakes lately
[0:39:06] SycNasty: You obviously don‚Äôt do dungeons.
[0:39:23] vizmaior: Thanks guys.
[0:39:34] billabong212: Monka doing the live pug route
[0:40:22] just_ok_viewer: @billabong212 not a live pug until the curse cast goes off :)
[0:40:24] Ali1331: @vizmaior classic definitely has fewer systems to learn. Now might be a good time to start a character in classic with WoTLK starting at the end of the month :) they‚Äôll be plenty of others starting as Wrath was a very popular expansion
[0:40:33] Cyphixoxo: roguetrainHandsup GO MONKA GO roguetrainHandsup
[0:40:42] discountturnip: what's todays dg?
[0:41:10] Lukasgate: Junkyard uncapped
[0:41:16] Dank1116: JY
[0:41:17] epii: wrath was no tjust a "very popular expansion". It was the most popular
[0:41:17] Moobot: Read more about The Great Push: https://blizz.ly/TGP2022
[0:41:21] ModeraYsera: @vizmaior for better and more encompassing information on whatever differences you are trying to catch up on, you could try wowhead or icyveins websites for guides on all things WoW related
[0:41:27] Dank1116: JY starting at 30
[0:42:22] hardtime73: icyveins ?? hahahaha
[0:42:35] vizmaior: question: if had bought the older expansion, why do i need to pay for the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù versions as well?
[0:42:36] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[0:42:49] hokagejones: @vizmaior no
[0:43:02] Bitterbarno: @vizmaior you only pay subscription fee
[0:43:04] Cowpanda: @vizmaior You only need a sub for it
[0:43:09] SskygamesS: I want so bad see more then 35 junkyard
[0:43:16] SycNasty: Wrath was def not the most popular expansion
[0:43:40] GenericAnimeName: @SskygamesS you will, it¬¥s not capped at 35 anymore
[0:43:40] PintilieDaniel: @SycNasty it was, look at the numbers, it had somewhere around 13 mil subs which was peak for wow
[0:43:48] epii: wrath capped at like 12.3m subs. Never been higher than that
[0:43:50] Cowpanda: @SycNasty Which was then ?
[0:44:14] SskygamesS: GenericAnimeName yeah i know is not cap thats why i want so bad
[0:44:26] SweatyDaniels: dratnoCD1 dratnoCD2
[0:44:27] myamoray: @epii it was flat out fun!
[0:44:37] SweatyDaniels: dratnoCD3 dratnoCD4
[0:45:00] Omnimorphic: people aren't doing the new dungeon first?
[0:45:00] Arkshol: @sycnasty @sycnasty wrath deff peak wow subs
[0:45:00] CozyWoW: wow crazy
[0:45:01] SskygamesS: boss is getting melted LUL
[0:45:08] myamoray: I think Wrath was the last wow expansion that Jeff Kaplan worked on as a Dev, but could be wrong
[0:45:25] Joejoe_: !gear

[0:45:57] just_ok_viewer: zaelia level optimizations
[0:46:06] Lukasgate: Its a mystery dungeon that will be announced tomorrow @skyy187

[0:46:28] fragileplasma: @GenericAnimeName nah they only did that on tyrannical 34 for safety and because the dungeon was capped at 35
[0:46:33] vizmaior: If anyone wants to run with me. Let me know. I am always down to make new friends. I will appreciate any and all help catching up and making sure I get the best understanding of the game before the expansion. I am in shadowlands lvl 52.
[0:46:45] Rachador: go warlock
[0:47:00] gruthori: you mere mortals wouldn't understand the optimizations that Zaelia does on a dungeon to dungeon basis...
[0:47:01] GenericAnimeName: @GenericAnimeName they played fort in their cup, only eu had tyra junkyard
[0:47:11] Liryns: üòºüö©MONKA üö©üòº
[0:47:33] LilPorkys_ttv: this is the last week of this right with all the teams not just 1 region?
[0:47:50] jonv0: Monka 2 locks intead of a mage
[0:47:55] Teddsan: whys monka refusing the mage meta ?
[0:48:08] Omnimorphic: starting at +30? admins want big numbers
[0:48:29] Arkshol: @sycnasty blizz biggest revenue comes from subs so yeah copies are kinda meh
[0:48:37] fragileplasma: @GenericAnimeName 34 Fort basically has 1 shot mechanics tho and they didnt need to 2 chest, they wont do it again, they didnt even use it on the 35
[0:48:43] Bitterbarno: @vizmaior have fun!
[0:48:48] Hastif: @Teddsan crims got bored of mage
[0:49:10] guzy44: @xyronic would you say asuna is the best mage of the 5 teams?
[0:49:15] Ghamera: prowlers
[0:49:16] Dudszlol: atrocityLiquid
[0:49:17] heyitsferris: Also to clarify - the prediction goes up to +38 for the sake of having five options
[0:49:22] Strailxx: @Omnimorphic It'll cap out at 35 anyways Unless they made some changes to tourney realm. So it just gets Junkyard over a lot faster for teams tbh gives them more time to do other keys
[0:49:41] vizmaior: Thank you bitter, I‚Äôm trying to ;) always better with friends. Running solo is kind of dry
[0:49:42] heyitsferris: @Omnimorphic Keys are no longer capped at +35!
[0:49:42] Lukasgate: @Omnimorphic they uncapped it
[0:49:45] kowaikokoro: echo getting 2 mailementals on mailboss big brain
[0:49:46] Omnimorphic: @Strailxx no cap this time
[0:49:46] Naguura: its not capped anymore
[0:49:49] Ronangic: @Strailxx they did remove the 35 cap for it
[0:50:02] Strailxx: Lets get SOME 40s THEN LETS GO
[0:50:07] Natyvstorm: yes
[0:50:09] bubblesthebelfwarrior: Why no keys with explosives?
[0:50:12] TheRelativeGenius: can I vote for +45?
[0:50:24] agatonsaxs: I think they removed the cap
[0:50:27] heyitsferris: @TheRelativeGenius Maybe in tomorrow's prediction ;)
[0:50:34] CozyWoW: @heyitsferris Hey!
[0:50:38] Omnimorphic: why can't we have odd numbered junkyard?
[0:50:38] SycNasty: How many people in this chat can do a 35?  I sure can‚Äôt.
[0:50:50] fragileplasma: EU cup had explosives in lower kara
[0:50:53] Thatsafy: I can :)
[0:50:54] bubblesthebelfwarrior: I can
[0:50:56] AffzMario: @SycNasty Me either KEKW
[0:51:04] swo12: i can :)
[0:51:08] heyitsferris: @Omnimorphic I'd have to do more math ://
[0:51:09] kesslive: @heyitsferris big fan
[0:51:10] Naguura: i could do a +40 but my teammates keep holding me back
[0:51:12] dendk1980: 25%
[0:51:18] ModeraYsera: @Naguura Kapp
[0:51:18] SycNasty: Lol no one has even done 35s yet on retail
[0:51:19] myamoray: @SycNasty not I...these teams, all impress me, top to bottom
[0:51:27] bubblesthebelfwarrior: @naguura true
[0:51:29] agatonsaxs: trueeee
[0:51:29] Moobot: Read more about The Great Push: https://blizz.ly/TGP2022
[0:51:31] AffzMario: Sure they are lol
[0:51:38] kimohunt: @Naguura you blaming Brian?
[0:51:39] Bitterbarno: @Naguura relatable
[0:51:46] Strailxx: I could do a +40 but I decide to play frost mage and y'know I'd rather keep other people ontop in io it makes them feel good.
[0:51:47] bubblesthebelfwarrior: I already timed a 37
[0:51:52] Naguura: @kimohunt exactly
[0:51:52] Kuroz: boopmeCarried
[0:51:54] SycNasty: No they are not
[0:51:59] ModeraYsera: @kimohunt yes Stare (kidding)
[0:52:02] TheRelativeGenius: @Naguura Same maybe we should find 4 people like us and deplete our first +25
[0:52:03] hackiii: @Naguura Nagony has to carry harder then naguuraGiggle
[0:52:04] gandalf_elantifascista: BatChest omg WoW
[0:52:07] kimohunt: KEKW
[0:52:11] fragileplasma: pretty impossible to get a 35 JY on livre tho
[0:52:22] Ghamera: They removed the Anti Kite
[0:52:29] SycNasty: The highest key timed is a 32 on live
[0:52:38] vizmaior: Is there a discord for wow? What‚Äôs the best way to meet players, make friends, or join a guild?  Thank you everyone for your help and the for the positive whispers in here.
[0:52:49] SycNasty: So idk how y‚Äôall are running 35s üòÇ
[0:53:01] dragoon2k: Monka falling behind Echo on the same key but one level lower
[0:53:02] fragileplasma: 35 JY is doable on live its just pretty impossible to get right now
[0:53:06] hackiii: @Kuroz lvlySip
[0:53:09] kimohunt: @vizmaior there is a lot of different discord for that. try to search a bit online XD
[0:53:10] TheRelativeGenius: @witheringprism Is it technically possible to get the same key but higher after timing a key?
[0:53:12] lNeyk0: Who is the favorite ? CN team are good ?
[0:53:23] picc0: @witheringprism no
[0:53:25] fragileplasma: @witheringprism nope
[0:53:26] Naguura: the problem isnt timing a 35 junkyard, the problem is requiring the key
[0:53:29] xArcesius: 8500
[0:53:33] kowaikokoro: 32 tyrannical gamibt monkaS
[0:53:43] Omnimorphic: the problem is after you time a 35 you get a 36 of a different dungeon
[0:53:52] Flipp5gg: Clap
[0:53:53] bubblesthebelfwarrior: Why is a mod keeping me from posting?
[0:53:57] kimohunt: @Naguura all you need is timed a +34 lower to get +35 JY, 5head move KEKW
[0:54:03] SycNasty: Yeah it‚Äôs so easy that‚Äôs why literally no one has done it lol
[0:54:06] TheRelativeGenius: +3 a gambit? maybe
[0:54:14] AffzMario: @bubblesthebelfwarrior He's modding :)
[0:54:16] browbeans: isnt the keys capped at +35 @Warcraft ?
[0:54:16] Strailxx: the 34/35 JY is probably gonna be getting by a GD or GMBT... Just at the roll of the gods
[0:54:22] SycNasty: Not counting TGP
[0:54:24] wildboy789789: thanks for gamba mods <3
[0:54:28] fragileplasma: who said it was easy lmao
[0:54:29] picc0: @sneakyskogstad no
[0:54:32] ModeraYsera: @bubblesthebelfwarrior ?? A mod isnt, you are probably trying to type something on the ban list
[0:54:35] alkhean: dratnos is wrong with his math. They aren't fighting 24/7. There's travel time that is always the same
[0:54:39] Naguura: the way you get a 35 junkyard is easy actually: first, +3 a 33 junkyard, then deplete whatever the 36 key is and receive a 35 junkyard
[0:54:43] kimohunt: @sneakyskogstad no on global final
[0:54:52] bubblesthebelfwarrior: I think it‚Äôs the word fail lol
[0:55:00] Orion280: now i feel old
[0:55:07] TheSweeneyGG: Feels oldge man
[0:55:11] AffzMario: 35+ is too easy, this is why i prefer doing 25+ you know :)
[0:55:11] CozyWoW: I'm a dinosaur ugh
[0:55:14] Yyve: @bubblesthebelfwarrior The automod in here is pretty strict I got timed out for too much text lol  just re-evaluate your comment :D
[0:55:23] Izkatu: Oldge
[0:55:27] chadderz7: forsenDespair
[0:55:28] Strailxx: @Naguura Then +3 the 35 JY into a 28 deplete 27 JY and continue the process?
[0:55:30] Akulenok14: @Naguura but you need to finish +36)

[0:58:59] PintilieDaniel: @epii i think the trick is to make him jump there to start his frontal, not make him run on the bridge
[0:59:07] SycNasty: I wish they‚Äôd bring back classic dungeons. Mythic + Wailing Caverns or like SFK, or BRD etc would be amazing.
[0:59:17] epii: ahhh, that might work idd. kekW
[0:59:17] brotan123: so they can't put oshir in a corner but tanking trixier here is okay? Susge
[0:59:28] requzzx: @SycNasty noo that would be bad
[1:00:04] billabong212: @brotan123 Oshir in the corner removes mechanics, this just stacks the bosses
[1:00:10] kowaikokoro: will echo go 33 street or yard hmm
[1:00:10] SycNasty: Like I get that people want shorter dungeons. But I would like some really long dungeons that take a couple hours. Something you don‚Äôt have to be in a big raid group for ya know?

[1:01:38] vizmaior: Alright friends, I‚Äôm out. Going to watch the new lord of the rings show :) take care and be safe everyone, happy Saturday!
[1:01:52] moohuu: @Naguura like old brd?
[1:01:54] Dissperia: a long dungeon is fine for story telling/lvling but not for m+
[1:02:08] SycNasty: Yeah not long m+ keys. But longer like 5 man raids would be amazing. Something to do cool with a small group of friends or IRL at LAN parties and stuff.
[1:02:09] jonv0: too long and people will drop out near the end and waste everyones time
[1:02:11] Strailxx: Its day 2 of TGP Dragonflight season 2, All of our teams are still in their first Blackrock Depths run of the competition.
[1:02:20] Flipp5gg: Wish Bliz would go for 20-25 min dungeons and create just more
[1:02:23] norther456: 45 JY when?
[1:02:25] mason_ii: small group sized raids would be sick. super long m+ dungeons? pain
[1:02:26] solwynn: what if you had alliance siege of boralus but it was 5 hours long and half of it was forced rp
[1:02:27] ellumitv: exactly, why again ? wouldnt it be better that Blizz makes new stuff for us to enjoy :D?
[1:02:44] Ghetolay: Why junkyard again !? we already saw them all time 35 JY. What a waste of time
[1:02:45] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[1:02:49] Beelge: !gear
[1:02:49] Naguura: i think longer dungeons could be fun, if they are actually a challenge (similar to raiding), like different difficulties and weekly lockouts etc. Like megadungeons, except a bit more difficult lol

[1:03:07] Mak6988: boring
[1:03:11] Boopmeep: i love kings rest
[1:03:16] SycNasty: @naguura exactly!
[1:03:22] Devismo: exciting
[1:03:31] z__a__e: kings rest BatChest
[1:03:35] moohuu: so old (classic) black rock depth
[1:03:41] Naguura: should probably also be 10 man instead of 5 man though
[1:03:43] didactylos6: Twilight Devastation!
[1:03:47] moltencrucible: @Ghetolay well those are S4 dungeons and it can go over 35 this week, so possibly a 36
[1:03:52] Strailxx: I feel like they would do something a little different if they were to bring back "Mega Dungeons" in a raid style, 5 mans would be fun but I could see maybe like a 1/2/5 kind of thing possibly?
[1:03:58] Boopmeep: 10 man m+ lets go
[1:04:03] picc0: @Ghetolay then be happy to see a 36 and 37 today
[1:04:11] moohuu: so more like old karazhan, or 10man raids in wrath
[1:04:12] norther456: @Naguura Maraudon Mythic Kappa Kappa
[1:04:16] Naguura: @Boopmeep we could have 2 PIs !
[1:04:20] sokmor01: why is echo behind ?

[1:04:43] Strailxx: @tettles Sir.... My computer can barely run the game as it is please.
[1:04:46] Hayo_oyaH: they should bring back island expeditions
[1:04:51] SycNasty: Endless opportunities. And Azeroth/other worlds has so much content that could be brought back. The world is massive!!
[1:04:53] belphegory: @naguura call Ion ‚ò∫Ô∏è
[1:04:53] Ghetolay: @Ghetolay I'm not I'll just come back 2h when they'll be done with it
[1:04:55] Kaelangg: @tettles kids these days wouldn't be able to clear the 40 man content we had to do back in the day Oldge
[1:05:00] bornzaim: @tettles 40 man sylvanas, not going to lag
[1:05:00] moohuu: @sokmor01 they didn't go to the new dungeon
[1:05:00] sokmor01: why is echo just starting 30 junk and ambition is on a 33
[1:05:01] adronus19: bring up some mathrezims please)
[1:05:01] Naguura: @Boopmeep quite mage

[1:05:30] norther456: 10 player dungeon/raid is a big must to bring
[1:05:32] fragileplasma: @sokmor01 because they chose to do a different key first?
[1:05:32] BlueCxMoreC: Gotta love mathematically uneducated people talk about numbers as "math".
[1:05:35] SycNasty: @kaelangg then how did they do that in classic lol?
[1:05:36] sokmor01: but echo had 31+ on every dungeon
[1:05:37] murtokqt: @sokmor01 echo did 32 streets 1st
[1:05:37] Naguura: @sokmor01 ambition already did +30 (+3)
[1:05:38] moltencrucible: @Kaelangg yea Molten Core, blackwing lair ... those were insane raids with lots of hard mechanics!
[1:05:39] tesch384: caves of lamentation m+ would be sick
[1:05:44] Teddsan: ambition lost a brezz
[1:05:45] Sebleh: @naguura omg it‚Äôs a dreadlord! I mean bird lady hai! Big fan btw naguuraLove
[1:05:53] tettles: 40 man raiding should be the only raid size too
[1:05:53] fragileplasma: @sokmor01 and? They went for 32 streets
[1:05:56] Azikielboi: @naguura is donuts still in?
[1:05:59] Zenon_D: is there anyway to see the gear?

[1:06:44] Solian13: I don't think versa scales the zap, looking at logs? The spell is tagged to not be influenced by caster stats

[1:38:44] Madidius: @sgtsandwichx that is just not even close to possible in a game where there are 36 specs and the style of damage or their niche is vastly different. The classes would have to almost be the same which just some recolor to be able to get the level of balance you are asking for

[2:08:36] drivedrive410: @pnavara Bruh baseline Blood DK damage is insanely good for a tank. Stop acting like its just gavel and bots. bear could use both and would do 1/2 the damage
[2:08:43] B3nbu: @Bitterbarno they can't spec stack atleast
[2:08:52] roldy27: @pnavara they would also need external healing.. you can basically just remove blood dk from your frames as a healer lol
[2:08:55] B3nbu: @Bitterbarno and they have to run a 1-1-3 comp
[2:09:07] Hugecrit: wow thats insane
[2:09:10] gruthori: @dinkarn you are mixing up classes. That is not a class-spec combo.

[2:24:59] rebound_ttv: I love Naowh just casually showing off he has Corrupted Ashbringer
[2:24:59] Teddsan: 2 chest not 3
[2:25:29] Aurhora3: But how did they lose so much time?
[2:25:31] drivedrive410: 0 deaths and not 2 chesting, what went wrong?
[2:25:48] MarukoCT: +2 the 36, and then easy 38
[2:25:53] KeicyX: @rebound_ttv i think u have all moggs on ptr no?
[2:25:53] Shearin77: HUH
[2:25:57] dragoon2k: I dont like that arguement +2 in 35 is most likely harder than +1 in 36 and both gives them the 37
[2:25:57] NotLimeThis: can we please get the 37 back on the screen hello

[2:26:09] NaBNez: baiting Ambition to run 37
[2:26:11] Kaelangg: probably a chance at 2 chest the 36 instead of the 37
[2:26:11] Lizzerazu: they go for a 36+2??
[2:26:14] Ontarin92: not even 2 chest KEKW
[2:26:16] viowel: is this the original ashbringer?
[2:26:18] s3ns3y322: @Warcraft They want 2 chest 36
[2:26:19] rebound_ttv: @KeicyX no clue, I never got into one of these.

[2:26:42] drivedrive410: @s3ns3y322 even if they 2 chested the 35 they could choose to do 36. Theres no benefit to NOT 2 chesting

[2:36:05] OnlyABanana: @veteranyaboy 36+2 is harder to do than 37 though
[2:36:06] alboreth: they lost hunter and priests bot buffs, it was doable
[2:36:22] KradishUK: I'm still baffled how Echo missed the +2 with no deaths on the board
[2:36:29] drivedrive410: @joepoej even if that was their plan they could do that after 2 chesting
[2:36:34] dragoon2k: totally a no death run would have been timed

[2:47:32] CrerisRs: @KinarPT theres no reason to run dungeon intentionally slowly just so you +1. They couldve zoned into a 36 after a 35+2 too
[2:47:32] noxinator: Please stop saying the wrong numbers for the key levels, casters, it is very confusing
[2:47:33] listrel1: @KinarPT If you +2 the 35 they can choose to run the 36 instead of 37

[2:54:04] Zyliea: @noxinator on live a 37 isnt plausible so its a default to 27 mentally
[2:54:13] CrerisRs: @noxinator probably because you dont really see 37 keys live so when he sees 7 he goes 27 out of familiarity
[2:54:21] Disgrountled: @noxinator every caster has done that mistake at least once, I believe it`s because they are not yet used to such a high key :D

[2:55:05] CrerisRs: @IanDooleyMusic to do a 36 junkyard live you would need a 35 key to +1 and none of the other dungeons are doable on such high levels
[2:55:05] CozyWoW: Dragonflight will be huge, it's a complete change in tone
[2:55:06] tangdill: @benevolentautoma Why arnt u subbed
[2:55:09] Zyliea: @noxinator to start, keys are capped at 35 lol
[2:55:12] avraan93: 1 question if echo timed from 35 +2 than the get 2 points? it is not the same if they timed 35 + 1 and 36 +1m

[2:55:53] derTikimann: keys not capped
[2:55:57] Axestro: @avraan93 The difference is how much time they save in doing 1 dungeon +2 compared to 2 dungeons +1.
[2:56:02] Hugecrit: @Zaelia 36 and 37 on screen
[2:56:03] whitehounds: @avraan93 the 35 doesn't matter anymore if they time a 36 or 37
[2:56:10] avraan93: a ok thx
[2:56:15] xhriiis: @avraan93 they get points based on what they have completed so 35 for a timed 35, getting +1 or +2 just means they save time not having to run 36
[2:56:18] CrerisRs: @IanDooleyMusic well in here they run the same key up, it doesnt work like that on live. You cant get a junkyard out of a junkyard on live

[2:56:52] IanDooleyTV: @CrerisRs OOOOOH. DUH. Okay that makes sense. SO they just keep smacking the same key up as high as it can then go work on the others?

[3:19:08] miguelinho22: when does another team gets eliminated?
[3:19:16] raikoneN_: @raikoneN_ they are not even proccing cheat death trinkets and still are running with hunter instead of rogue, so they have lots of stuff to use yet
[3:19:21] moderatygos: we eliminate the lowest team at the end of the day today
[3:19:23] CrerisRs: @snorrow92 ah ok I thought they did it in 36:08 but you are right I misremembered they did it in 35:08
[3:19:34] Shearin77: @pnavara m-i-l-k-s-ha-k-e is banned too ... i don't have a clue why
[3:20:04] Klangens_: what opera hall event is it this week in EU on live servers? any1 know?

[3:20:14] lewhitehd69: eliminate monkaW squid game irl monkaW
[3:20:15] ModeraYsera: if ppl didnt abuse words and phrases then they wouldnt be on the ban list, sorry
[3:20:18] RwLmaster: TR
[3:20:20] kykki: @Lashga tr
[3:20:22] stimpius: @Lashga TR, so no tiertiaries
[3:20:23] drivedrive410: @raikoneN_ they procced A LOT of cheats, what are you talking about. And the timer isnt possible with rogue
[3:20:34] mokwell: malkshake
[3:20:49] adilyaxx: u go do those 25 urself
[3:20:50] mad0monk: Ambition should be able to tie today since they have that 35** they can keep upping everything else by one, run that 37 last and tie
[3:20:54] Ghamera: Imagine tanking at such a high level for 5 hours straight.... gross
[3:20:56] raikoneN_: @drivedrive410 dont agree
[3:20:58] Iliasuu: molkshake
[3:21:15] slackstacker: haha rekt
[3:21:19] KradishUK: Do we know what timings Echo need to get this 33?
[3:21:20] miguelinho22: This format is way better than the one we had 1 year ago
[3:21:27] drivedrive410: @drivedrive410 I mean rogue overall is clearly going to be lower than Surv in JY
[3:21:28] hightestjesus: xd
[3:21:32] TSmarine: my molkshake brings all the bois the junkyard
[3:21:38] slackstacker: ya i agree @miguelinho22
[3:21:39] drivedrive410: Otherwise theyd be running rogue as is
[3:21:47] Trodenskjold: @KradishUK Yeah, the timing is 39mins, just get it under that
[3:21:50] kimohunt: @drivedrive410 rogue sadly capped at 5 targets
[3:22:00] sorli_: Still wonder why blizz doesnt do what Riot did and remove slowmode, allow all emotes and memes in chat, it drives engagement and viewership more than you think
[3:22:09] Feartuskk: @drivedrive410 not about the dmg about the survivability
[3:22:20] slackstacker: @hightestjesus if jpc isnt on rogue it upsets the cosmic balance of wow for me lol
[3:22:28] Trodenskjold: @sorli_ Emote spamming is just annoying
[3:22:30] Iliasuu: what are you all playing in df, I'm going mage and ww alt
[3:22:34] DhuumFPS: @sorli_ fun aint allowed .
[3:22:36] Aurhora3: @Feartuskk I mean, no
[3:22:36] drivedrive410: @Feartuskk 38 IS about the damage as well the 37 was timed with less than 2 mins. 8% increase they dont time
[3:22:43] KradishUK: @sorli_ I suspect it has something to do with the DFEH lawsuit and Blizzards overreaction to it
[3:22:44] Barsonik: @sorli_ riot's chat is awful
[3:22:52] hilavitkutin: i mean riot also has an armada of paid mods

[3:23:15] TSmarine: 1 IS 1 TOO MANY
[3:23:22] sorli_: @hilavitkutin Ok but blizz viewership is lower so they can hire 2-3 mods and its fine
[3:23:22] moohuu: "moonkin balance" - that's the same ;-)
[3:23:22] fainean: moonkin balance good one dratnos

[3:24:17] Little_Cap: @daSPAMit same here, its kinda sad not seeing him on the class that he's the best at, but I can see why, and thats because its target capped, they should have a soft cap of 5 where BF does the 65% but then it should hit up to another 15 targets at 25% or 30% (thats with Dancing Steel talent)
[3:24:20] SirJonny1998: @ififtyzloty yes

[3:25:07] Little_Cap: @miguelinho22 whichever team doesnt have the tiebreaker
[3:25:11] Fnjaf: holy or disc priest?
[3:25:16] Shearin77: let's gooo monka <3
[3:25:17] hightestjesus: @Little_Cap With the party buffs they are getting they will 95% become meta again is df.
[3:25:30] Little_Cap: @daSPAMit I mean, true, but again with Surv uncapped, its gonna much more damage than Rogue in any dungeon
[3:25:37] Omnimorphic: performance has to finish 4 dungeons, that's gonna be close
[3:25:54] Iliasuu: is it even possible for ambition to catch up with echo if they don't make any mistakes?

[3:26:08] drivedrive410: @daSPAMit Not in ANY dungeon. They played rogue in Upper and Workshop
[3:26:14] slackstacker: @little_cap i would copy pasta. but it goes against my moral compass Kappa

[3:26:58] dkwarrior4: !gear

[3:29:26] Marny97: happend to me this week in gambit
[3:29:28] SultanGaming44: Lol buged orbs well played wow
[3:29:29] DocAIM_: where is the stops cheeky skips different starts ?
[3:29:29] blinkeys: @Boopmeep hehe
[3:29:31] Vodrin: so much HUH farming
[3:29:35] Karail_Lyoona: was it the purple orb the was missing?
[3:29:38] syl3n: yeah, should give them a 12 minute grace period
[3:29:46] laundrevity: what ruling can admins make? they just lost 30 min...
[3:29:46] nazragna: ambition gets no slack for a bug against their will but echo gets free time yesterday Kappa
[3:29:50] gruthori: HUH ?
[3:29:51] hightestjesus: @Vodrin I think it will be quite impactful, depending on balancing ofc. Also they are very very close to being meta atm since shroud still saves a ton of time. Also dont sleep on the dam reduction from assa.
[3:29:51] Hive_wow: ye give time
[3:29:52] bebincalicious: Lashga wants Eye of Azshara
[3:30:09] Lashga: Hows it fun if R1 keys are all about damage?
[3:30:10] picc0: @laundrevity they lost 11 mins something
[3:30:14] Omnimorphic: did they give up the iron docks?
[3:30:19] gruthori: @Rekz3 LUL
[3:30:20] Hastif: @laundrevity they can give them back the time they lost

[3:30:30] nazragna: @Rekz3 lmao idk why comment got deleted that was funny
[3:30:39] drivedrive410: @Lashga theres plenty of different routes with the seasonal affix and how much you value it
[3:30:41] whitehounds: @Omnimorphic for now
[3:30:43] SultanGaming44: Ikr
[3:30:45] woahdudewhat: @Rekz3 LUL
[3:30:47] scilla3497: @Lashga You're not doing r1 keys, and it's not all about damage even at r1
[3:30:50] VitalityKlitschko: @Warcraft hello gehennas is dying, help pls
[3:31:04] drivedrive410: Iron Docks for example theres like 5 different starts you can do depending on if you want to play Zulg or not, go straight to boss etc
[3:31:09] chamberkill: @Rekz3 LuL
[3:31:10] frriiedd: @Lashga its about damage.... finesse, not dieing... and optimizing different routes... what areyou talkin about?
[3:31:14] elhanchoow: @xyyni chill
[3:31:22] nullvektorx: where are the bodytype 2 enjoyers?

[3:31:28] Arisolo: Ambition just had a very messy first pull. Had some fish stick healing
[3:31:35] Vodrin: @hightestjesus 3% dmg reduction is not impactful in m+, and its gimping dmg as its harder to get the carnage cd etc... i don't think assassination would be meta (we're talking tgp - not 30 keys etc) but sure we'll see
[3:31:39] NTeiras: are the streets trades the same every key ?
[3:31:47] riptack_: D:
[3:31:49] woahdudewhat: @VitalityKlitschko yes, these MDI casters are going to help your login get lower LUL

[3:31:55] Hugecrit: FeelsBadMman
[3:31:59] epii: @Lashga also, if dungeons was more complicated, we would have even fewer pug tanks as it would then be an even bigger hurdle for tanks to learn routes. Sure, it might be fun for the "better" players. But the casuals would suffer
[3:32:11] Elfandsafety: Chatting let me explain why its not @xyronic

[3:33:45] catechism__: ok thanks =)
[3:33:46] drivedrive410: @epii  i dont agree with that dungeons should have both easy and complicated solutions thats what makes a good dungeon
[3:33:49] not_that_guy: @mods @Warcraft can you please tell what happened to previous 32 ambition key

[3:34:22] Groschat: Why did ambition reset, did the boss bug
[3:34:25] sam_promise: are we just ignoring what happened with ambition????
[3:34:37] laundrevity: also ambition is in NA, so they have a lot of time today after tourney to research how to +37 or 38 junkyard
[3:34:43] Seeno_: @sam_promise yes
[3:34:46] ModeraYsera: @VitalityKlitschko I have no control over anything related to servers, sorry
[3:34:48] moderatygos: nothing happened with ambition, its all a figment of your imagination Kappa
[3:34:52] drivedrive410: Im sure the admins are investigating it relax
[3:34:55] whitehounds: they talked about it when it happened, waiting for info and confirmation on what happened
[3:34:56] worthtv: @sam_promise did u forget what happened last mdi?
[3:35:04] PsymonDash: i thought it was Doa used to love the LCK days

[3:35:20] snorrow92: @laundrevity echo has that same amount of time tomorrow morning for EU
[3:35:22] althyro: Can you fix the EU wotlk servers blizzard game is not playable..
[3:35:23] Rogastik: @sam_promise we dont know what happened, they might have restarted cause they decided they are too slow, there is no confirmation it was a bug yet
[3:35:25] syl3n: calling it a wipe is, huh, not quite right
[3:35:37] elhanchoow: was to toggle cheat
[3:35:38] hightestjesus: @Vodrin Ah yea might not be that good then, more of a raid thing unless the dmg is competitive and healing is really tight. Still rogue utility is so nutty that they have to be pretty trash to not be meta especially in early season.
[3:35:40] sam_promise: @sam_promise ambition didnt play in the last mdi so i guess i did...
[3:35:46] Klaxsin: are there any affixes?
[3:35:47] elhanchoow: rofl
[3:35:53] moderatygos: see there you go, the admins are still deciding what to do. ambition can't just sit around and wait for a response
[3:36:09] Naguura: just give them some time to check what happened guys
[3:36:09] ThyDude: this 4-way screen split would be dope if it was streamed at a resolution I could read any of the timers or names on the hp bars
[3:36:10] BrightsideRed: Can these teams stream this? I would rather watch Echo individually and would like a link üòÅ
[3:36:17] Naguura: its not being ignored dont worry

[3:37:15] ThyDude: @ThyDude I have 4k with gigabit streaming, the names are pixelated my guy
[3:37:25] epii: @drivedrive410 yeah that would always be nice to see and we "kinda" do that already. To wearying degree. But would idd be nice too have more. But adding more without also making the easier router much more complicated might be hard. But then again, Blizz is a big company. They should be able to do it. (they also should be able to balance classes better, but that never happens)
[3:37:29] lurkbelow82: denied kekw
[3:37:37] ModeraYsera: @ThyDude Its fine for me, sorry you are having issues

[3:38:04] ThyDude: @ThyDude any suggestions? glad to accept fault if there's something better I can do
[3:38:08] drivedrive410: @epii You just seem to be wanting to complain class balance is pretty solid right now, there is never not a meta in m+
[3:38:12] catechism__: Shame is that was inadvertently caused by the players. I've had that happen on live before
[3:38:14] Klaxsin: are all of the teams the same comp by regulation or is this just the only meta?

[3:38:43] ModeraYsera: @Klaxsin they are free to choose what they wish, but it only makes sense that they play what works (meta)
[3:38:44] hightestjesus: @Vodrin Yea maybe, on the other hand though in 8.3 you did half the dmg a fire mage did but it was still best in all but 2 dungeons. Maybe teams are better now and dont need the utility anymore.

[4:55:56] QbenAA: jpc vs nerf again
[4:56:23] kamisato47: wait why ambition got 10 extra mins
[4:56:23] theslinny: They passed 11:30 if tettles timer is right
[4:56:26] Omnimorphic: when tank outdps a dps
[4:56:26] KradishUK: How many minutes do Echo and the other team that got locked out of JY at start of day have?
[4:56:29] Reuschel: Ambition 10 extra minutes? NA Bias! Kappa
[4:56:34] AntedAP: 34k healing omg
[4:56:41] ollie0610: Rat man tettles
[4:56:48] billabong212: @oreki47 the first boss of gambit didn't spawn orbs so they lost 10mins to a bug
[4:56:51] miguelinho22: performance made a mistake by going for the 37?
[4:56:54] Bashiel: @oreki47 they found a bug on hylbrande
[4:56:54] B3nbu: @oreki47 first boss gmb bugged for them
[4:56:57] Omnimorphic: @oreki47 the boss bugged and they lost 10 minutes
[4:56:58] ollie0610: @tettles
[4:57:04] kamisato47: oh that's reasonable
[4:57:10] ZizzTV: gunkar fight took longer cause jpc gets destroyed by nerfdk again
[4:57:19] B3nbu: @Bashiel "found" it has been in the game since the boss came
[4:57:20] ZizzTV: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:57:28] CrerisRs: @miguelinho22 they spent too long going for that key, it took them like an hour to get it, meanwhile other teams got points elsewhere
[4:57:30] Seliathan: @miguelinho22 their +37 could be their saving grace. their main problem was the depleted +30 lower last night, and the failed +31 streets earlier
[4:57:43] YungStany: LETS GO BABY
[4:57:49] Bashiel: @B3nbu "found" as in it happened to them
[4:57:56] shiiiftkey: why show echo and ambition now when they're through, put the other runs on
[4:58:14] KradishUK: 13 min Hylda from Monka  :S
[4:58:16] Amaazya: @shiiiftkey pssst
[4:58:17] Elson_Vi: ^
[4:58:41] Omnimorphic: where's echo going after this?
[4:58:52] KradishUK: @shiiiftkey Because Echo and Ambition are the frontrunners and are doing prog keys?
[4:59:04] Crezzek: @Omnimorphic iron docks probs
[4:59:06] billabong212: @Omnimorphic I would guess Junkyard
[4:59:07] whitehounds: @Omnimorphic 32 ID probably
[4:59:11] nachito_champi: if echo times that 32 lower, is it a WR?
[4:59:24] Crezzek: @nachito_champi no
[4:59:29] Shearin77: zaelia pod
[4:59:37] Crezzek: they timed a 32 last week i think
[4:59:38] KradishUK: I think they did 32 Lower last weekend with Monka
[4:59:38] Dellus7: They should finish it for the weekly chest
[4:59:40] billabong212: @nachito_champi no 32 lower was timed by multiple teams in the EU week
[4:59:42] shiiiftkey: @KradishUK They're irrelevant right now. The entertainment and drama now comes from the other guilds vying to get in.
[4:59:59] YungStany: wtf is that a dragon with  hat
[5:00:01] Elson_Vi: ^
[5:00:02] Lorans_TV: ambition doing weekly no leavers LUL
[5:00:10] moderatygos: their captain is a dragon
[5:00:15] ModeraYsera: @yungstany our captain is a dragon Stare
[5:00:18] Omnimorphic: @yungstany pirate dragon
[5:00:26] KradishUK: @shiiiftkey Your right - how dare people care about the teams trying to actually win the competition
[5:00:34] YungStany: no way
[5:00:36] sagspon: ambition is the real deal
[5:00:46] YungStany: ChefFrank
[5:00:46] Moobot: Read more about The Great Push: https://blizz.ly/TGP2022
[5:00:54] Shearin77: irrelevant LUL
[5:00:59] datsussyguy: Our captain is a murloc?
[5:01:01] Omnimorphic: If dragons were real I bet they would wear hats
[5:01:28] Elson_Vi: i'd follow a murloc captain, that dude deserves it if he makes it to captain
[5:01:54] moderatygos: at this point, it is pretty difficult if not impossible for team performance to make a comeback, all teams and what they're doing is still relevant
[5:01:55] JMPanamos: If I was a real dragon, I'd definitely wear a top hat
[5:01:59] Omnimorphic: it's gonna be hard following murloc orders
[5:02:09] Clairfoyance: how many days left?
[5:02:19] moderatygos: tomorrow is the finale
[5:02:23] B3nbu: @Lofi_Chill 1
[5:02:29] Shearin77: @Lofi_Chill tomorrow is the big final
[5:02:40] olivoilolja: LUL
[5:02:45] dasru: warlock got vers?
[5:02:55] SerThunderbeans: @shiiiftkey None of these runs are irrelevant, the total score accumulated ultimately determines the winners of the whole event, not just who gets dropped this weekend.
[5:02:55] tigerpanda_: its passable
[5:02:59] jordzkie05: gg
[5:03:01] quadzzs: xdd
[5:03:13] Dellus7: I heard the screams from Zhixu across the ocean
[5:03:13] SerThunderbeans: *dropped today
[5:03:14] sagspon: who gonna win? what do u guys think?
[5:03:20] quadzzs: zhixu gaming getting destroyed
[5:03:27] B3nbu: Echo
[5:03:34] daddyemi1991: echo for sure
[5:03:38] Shearin77: echo <3
[5:03:51] Omnimorphic: wipe junk go lower
[5:04:06] YungStany: dayme captain dragon left
[5:04:07] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[5:04:17] YungStany: rip
[5:04:23] KradishUK: Or maybe they should start their Lower Kara so that if something goes wrong they have some time to restart (Monka from yesterday says hi)
[5:04:25] daddyemi1991: All teams are very good, but echo is a other lvl :D
[5:04:49] Elson_Vi: hasn't echo won like the last three?
[5:04:49] Shearin77: echo built different
[5:05:07] B3nbu: @Elson_Vi MDI yes
[5:05:08] Bashiel: chinese team won last tgp i believe
[5:05:13] Half_Bear: it's like football, some teams participate and at the end Echo wins
[5:05:30] gruthori: Zaelia slept well last night, i can feel it.
[5:05:36] miguelinho22: i just hope for at least a 1 point winner diff
[5:05:42] billabong212: @Bashiel didn't that team split up though?
[5:05:52] Omnimorphic: go midnight

[5:05:58] moderatygos: aster is no longer an org, some of the players are competing in this tournament
[5:05:59] KradishUK: Echo looking so clean so far - caster curse incoming
[5:06:06] Elson_Vi: yeah, Echo's healer is hands down the carry.
[5:06:07] Bashiel: @billabong212 yes, but i think 3 of them are in one of these chinese teams we have here
[5:06:11] Shearin77: @Bashiel yes 3 of them are now on zhiixu
[5:06:13] B3nbu: doa is tox

[5:06:29] B3nbu: @clockygs yes
[5:06:34] BadManners_: this fight is nightmare as melee
[5:06:36] taekwonyoshi: so toxic D:
[5:06:37] laughtalez: @Elson_Vi everyone is playing insanely good tbh
[5:06:39] OnlyABanana: LOL
[5:07:07] Dellus7: For a class that is called survival is pretty hard to survive tho
[5:07:08] Elson_Vi: @laughtalez yeah, but Healer is the clutch role.
[5:07:12] yuriblack99: w8 merees is playing nf?
[5:07:13] Bashiel: either 33  lower or 37 jy
[5:07:13] Shearin77: zhixu Sadge
[5:07:15] KradishUK: Zhixu RIP
[5:07:17] Menaceirl: the only time junkyard has ever been hard compared to anything
[5:07:22] yuriblack99: ne*
[5:07:41] miguelinho22: actually prefer performance over zhixu
[5:08:41] SerThunderbeans: Why are most pepe emojis not allowed in this chat? WubTF
[5:08:47] Omnimorphic: 16 minutes
[5:08:55] wisebighorn: If preformance makes this Docks they get to 158, and then one more gives them 159. how are they gonna reach the 160 the other teams have?
[5:09:07] whitehounds: @SerThunderbeans STARE
[5:09:10] ModeraYsera: @SerThunderbeans because they were abused by other chatters
[5:09:19] Shearin77: ouch
[5:09:19] FishAndKids: Not standing in AMZ because of the nerf.... thanks Max
[5:09:21] moderatygos: they only have 14 minutes left to start a key, so performance probably can't find the points they need
[5:09:27] tigerpanda_: I saw the admins using Stare so its def a double standard
[5:09:35] Omnimorphic: PepePls
[5:09:47] jordzkie05: Stare @chat
[5:09:49] xGriefxGodx: Lichborn tech
[5:09:54] snorrow92: Stare
[5:09:54] Omnimorphic: you can't turn off global emotes
[5:09:58] Ontarin92: not alot
[5:09:59] SerThunderbeans: Huh... I wonder what exactly amounts to abusing something like "Feels Amazing Man"
[5:10:00] KradishUK: More than 1
[5:10:01] Sprayz4dayz: more than on less than 100k
[5:10:01] WorgenDeath: it does like 3k healing or something it's super bad
[5:10:02] Dellus7: with vamp blood like 10k id sya
[5:10:09] Shearin77: remember Rupi soloing Soleah?
[5:10:10] moderatygos: a lot of people type out the emotes, but we don't have 3rd party emotes activated

[5:11:01] EzzLyfe: @wisebighorn if they finish docks they get to 158, then they have 31 lower kara for 2 more points as long as they start it before end of day timer
[5:11:05] SerThunderbeans: @WaIes Performance will rise!
[5:11:19] vagash123: Ah yes, the """"tank"""" merely 4k dps behind the actual dps on a boss fight lol

[5:12:10] Elson_Vi: wait, how can performance, being 3 points behind somehow beat out zhixu?
[5:12:15] Omnimorphic: they won't one phase without lust
[5:12:32] JMPanamos: Severe Dusting LUL
[5:12:33] picc0: @Elson_Vi 1 point for ID and then 2 points by timing their lower
[5:12:36] runnesvoid: sound effects too high ^^
[5:12:47] Hastif: they are not ok
[5:12:53] SevzyYEP: hold up.. a 37?
[5:13:09] Elson_Vi: @picc0 but how does a tie lead to them winning out?
[5:13:14] picc0: @Elson_Vi they then win tie breaker cause of their 37 jy iirc
[5:13:20] Davethecave: 37 is kinda insane
[5:13:25] Omnimorphic: the tie breaks
[5:13:27] Sanorek: they have JY 37
[5:13:32] SirJonny1998: @sevzyyep Team Performance has already timed it
[5:13:41] nerves1: gobbersmak innit
[5:13:41] Elson_Vi: gotcha, thanks
[5:13:48] Sanorek: so tie break is for Team Performance
[5:14:03] SevzyYEP: @SirJonny1998 i know, i see it, that's why I said it, big boi key
[5:14:31] KradishUK: 4 mins behind performance but im sure its fine
[5:14:42] Bashiel: 72 count is the slope and one pack on the right
[5:15:00] KradishUK: Echo looking good for the 32 LK
[5:15:08] gruthori: Meeres is such a god

[5:17:17] NTeiras: monkaS ?
[5:17:39] Boopmeep: youre still gonna end up with higher dps naturally due to cleave @tendaaar even when doing single target rotation lol @tendaaar

[5:51:01] jordzkie05: that forced 37 might have cost them
[5:51:02] billabong212: Can someone please tell these caster that the debuff from scars is not the bleed this is happening every week XD
[5:51:07] BuffaloManN73: 37 WR but eliminate Sadge
[5:51:13] CrerisRs: @PsYc86 maybe stop focusing on what ppl are playing to push highest keys in a competition where every second matters
[5:51:13] xernius123: echo doing a +37 not even showing it....
[5:51:17] Joshmo18: feels sadge when you get a WR 37 and get kicked out
[5:51:22] bloamie1: What is the ??? Dungeon there?
[5:51:29] AyPhnyx: @BuffaloManN73 the 28 lower is the problem
[5:51:32] HelenaBertinelli: @billabong212 The bleed is the debuff that breaks Maiden's shield. What do you mean.
[5:51:34] moderatygos: mystery dungeon we haven't announced yet
[5:51:37] whitehounds: @xernius123 cuz it's not getting timed

[5:52:01] billabong212: @HelenaBertinelli the debuff you see on the player bars is a slow not a bleed
[5:52:03] Cronuoss: bro show echo please
[5:52:08] WaIes: @PsYc86 its a game for literally millions of people, you can run basically any comp past +20 keys, thats pretty impressive as far as balancing goes, at the very very top theres always going to be a mathematically "best" comp
