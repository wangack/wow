[3:39:15] I_Am_Fletch: woah! that's a nice sofa!
[3:39:19] Truthseeker96: @tetenqt how about parsing really well in a learner raid first so you have the logs to get into a parsing sweaty group.
[3:39:27] Truthseeker96: its simple
[3:39:32] Alori_: the internet will only get worse with ads Sadge
[3:39:46] I_Am_Fletch: NOWAY
[3:39:56] IrishMc90: he complains about ads while playing him for his stream
[3:39:59] IrishMc90: lol
[3:40:04] Alori_: @Truthseeker96 in order to parse well I think you need a great group to kill the boss as quickly as possible
[3:40:06] philsi_ow: not pictured in this video: the previous five wipes Kappa
[3:40:12] Alori_: the quicker you kill, typically the better your logs will be

[3:40:18] OozeSnoozeLose: the possibilities in this game are endless when you press your buttons every gcd LUL
[3:40:21] Alori_: at least on retail, dunno if same applies to classic
