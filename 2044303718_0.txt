[0:55:45] chickenbaggins: FlowerCatJAM
[0:56:00] savagesap: that warlock pumping
[0:56:04] iamdemonslayer: SavixSoulJam
[0:56:14] iamdemonslayer: I hope every mob is immune to bleed LULW
[0:56:25] FiryWynter: Yo, we have a piloting mechanic like in Putricide in Wrath
[0:56:26] Shreddingly: They will probably be mechanical *drumroll*
[0:56:28] FiryWynter: POGGERS
[0:56:32] Deadge_Gartic: lmao you basically described retail raiding
[0:56:34] Deomas11: We'll get to ride the one with guns like in Ulduar for sure
[0:56:35] Cryptoji_Jojoji: I bet there's a bunch of bombs poisons and things immune to bleed
[0:56:36] Deadge_Gartic: dont expect too much from classic om
[0:56:43] fuzzywuzzyqt: I bet there's gnomes
[0:57:13] fuzzywuzzyqt: also if you don't have your pearl trinket yet, you might as well quit imo
[0:57:18] Deadge_Gartic: gonna write again sir
[0:57:21] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix currently your game is louder then music everything else is fine
[0:57:32] Deadge_Gartic: effects are loud
[0:57:33] highkingkevin: yup
[0:57:38] Deadge_Gartic: music is low
[0:57:40] highkingkevin: was good vbefore

[0:57:49] fuzzywuzzyqt: Music is fine imo
[0:57:50] Turbopumper: just increase desktop audio on obs
[0:57:50] nikola420tesla: It sounds fine to me om
[0:57:54] highkingkevin: thats better
[0:57:56] Deadge_Gartic: i meant
[0:58:00] Deadge_Gartic: effects are louder then music om
[0:58:07] toxus92: theres an entrance which checks if youre a gnome or not if you arent a gnome you cant enter
[0:58:12] Shreddingly: I am just hoping they overlooked the mechanical trinket controller and we can chainuse it at some boss to beat another boss
[0:58:15] AwongTV: music is loud it’s fine you can turn it down lol
[0:58:20] Arzondir: you didn't have voicemeeter on irght

[0:58:26] FiryWynter: You need to change the settings in OBS @ Savix
[0:58:30] CamGG__: just tts every noise "woosh" "sword clash" "gun noise"
[0:58:59] high_ryy: Since gnomer is full of mechanical mobs, poisons/bleeds gonna work?
[0:59:46] Arzondir: you should be able to just change the knob from the rode and then turn down obs volume no?
[0:59:52] Shreddingly: Most seems to assume it won't @high_ryy
[1:00:09] Deadge_Gartic: arzondir he might need a 10 minute fix after raid arzondWicked
[1:00:27] MochiMurloc: @high_ryy Most likely no tuh
[1:00:42] casualfriendly: Hello all :)

[1:00:58] Arzondir: om
[1:01:36] Arzondir: yeah it do be a bit of guessing
[1:01:42] heyimtazz: voicemeeter is good though because you can split audio channels right? Like remove copyright audio for clips and stuff?
[1:01:52] Shreddingly: @zachshnacks take it as your opportunity to parse

[1:29:29] Moose_Ka: Naxx is to epic to be only 20 people I think
[1:29:32] Corporal_Kyle: I think 25 should be max
[1:29:34] Lucons1: 40 is kinda bland
[1:29:34] danbalanceltrist: raids*
[1:29:42] Shreddingly: 40man is great when you are not the one organizing
[1:29:43] toxus92: 20, just like mythic raiding
[1:29:43] Cryptoji_Jojoji: M by
[1:30:14] Moose_Ka: Also its nice becoming friends with the raid team. We went from 10 randoms to now we play lethal company together

[1:35:43] subsonic_eye: but its not the hunter it was the scorpion pet
[1:35:54] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix people ignore the fact war doing top damage doesnt really effect pvp LULW
[1:35:59] AceOfFlame: hunters were top dmg in HC sod and nobody cared because it really just was pvp side of hunter
[1:36:00] Shreddingly: Well to be fair hunter pet was the top dps. Hunter was on pair with shadow priests

[1:39:44] misomander: you can just do dailies on like 2 characters and make a token each month
[1:39:46] FiryWynter: Do GDKP in Wrath and you literally get a token for every run
[1:39:48] paladan_tich: They can, but alot of the boosters in Retail use discord to coordinate gorups and its tos.

[4:08:02] BlueZense: Kratom is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. Consumption of its leaves produces both stimulant effects (in low doses) and sedative effects (in high doses), and can lead to psychotic symptoms, and psychological and physiological dependence. Kratom leaves contain two major psychoactive ingredients (mitragynine and 7-hydroxymytragynine). These leaves are crushed and then smoked, brewed with tea, or placed into gel capsules.
