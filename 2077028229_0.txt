[0:45:44] Zirconn__: bao is easy to fuck up
[0:45:49] Kuroz: !groups
[0:45:49] StreamElements: Group finder wa : https://wago.io/klC4qqHaF the weakaura isn't getting updated. https://wago.io/JhmeKOgMw (dragonflight version) or use premade group filter it does the same thing.
[0:45:51] Sebleh: just make sure to use salt
[0:45:55] mika01: naguuraFlower  hi everyon
[0:46:00] mika01: e
[0:46:02] nuxt_qc: bao is more funky
[0:46:04] Sebleh: !bread
[0:46:04] StreamElements: A friend of mine just told me you once said Italians can't make bread, that our bread is unsalted and tastes like nothing. You probably ate bread once in like Florence where they specifically make unsalted bread and talked shit about the whole country when our bread and baking in general is ages above everyone else. Get more informed before shouting baseless opinions next time 🍞
[0:46:09] Kuroz: CatDriving @mika01
[0:46:17] Sebleh: just cut them in half
[0:46:31] Sebleh: make it the norm to use half brioche buns

[0:49:37] merlozelf: merlozelf subscribed with Prime. 
[0:49:49] mika01: nope, it's an awful day
[0:49:49] Zirconn__: why do we have leap years  every 4 years
[0:49:52] mika01: LUL
[0:50:04] TotallyNotRaien: because the year has 365 days and 6 hours
[0:50:17] oTOKEo: every 4 years
[0:50:25] oTOKEo: Olympic years
[0:50:39] nuxt_qc: ask neil degrasse tyson or smth
[0:50:44] Zirconn__: the rough estimate of one revolution is 365.24 days, so every 4 years that .24 adds up to an additional day
[0:50:45] kiwimooncake: Hey Naguura! Hope you're having a great day! Would you mind telling me which addon is that, that allows you to see the classes on the looking for dungeon thing? <3
[0:51:04] Zirconn__: I was hoping for a more mathematical answer from you
[0:51:07] Sebleh: it’s because some Roman doichebags wanted to insert their names into the calendar year and were supposed to have 10 months of 36 days or something and someone figured out the solution is to add 0.25 days to each year.
[0:51:09] TotallyNotRaien: right exactly what you said
[0:51:10] Zirconn__: “I went to university”
[0:51:40] TotallyNotRaien: he did you dirty
[0:51:43] Sebleh: how would you know?
[0:51:46] Zirconn__: how woild you know
[0:51:49] Zirconn__: you never went to class
[0:51:50] Sebleh: I thought you never went to class Kappa
[0:51:55] TotallyNotRaien: damn
[0:51:57] countrycount: Elitism not only in WoW now even in the real world...tztztz :P
[0:51:59] Zirconn__: me and sebleh are just twinning today
[0:52:10] Sebleh: the bar is not a class nagoogoo

[0:53:36] Sebleh: was it socially awkwardness or social anxiety?
[0:53:43] Sebleh: naguuraOMEGALUL
[0:53:56] countrycount: no
[0:53:57] TotallyNotRaien: not really
[0:53:59] Zirconn__: no
[0:54:06] sim967: no
[0:54:11] Sebleh: no it’s not the same thing
[0:54:13] Klotzi: HUH no
[0:54:15] TotallyNotRaien: it can happen at the same time but theyre not the same thing
[0:54:24] Zirconn__: socially awkward is you standing alone in the back of a party. social anxiety is freaking out about going to the party.
[0:54:28] countrycount: nah
[0:54:32] countrycount: not even close xD
[0:54:32] TotallyNotRaien: awkwardness is just not knowing social cues
[0:54:36] Sebleh: I would take pictures of the board so I didn’t have to write notes until I felt like it
[0:54:48] JamesOlogist: social anxiety is the fear of being judged by others
[0:54:55] TotallyNotRaien: they can happen at the same time
[0:54:57] mika01: logic
[0:55:00] TotallyNotRaien: but not the same thing
[0:55:12] Sebleh: they go hand in hand but not the way you think lol
[0:55:19] TotallyNotRaien: you never went to a psychiatrist about it?
[0:55:39] TotallyNotRaien: shame, it couldve helped alot
[0:55:50] countrycount: tbf you are weird
[0:55:52] mika01: it all turned out OK-ish :)
[0:55:58] Sebleh: you are weird for sure
[0:56:00] Gilgalad75: Most people with social anxiety don't seek help
[0:56:02] TotallyNotRaien: if anxiety is keeping you from living your life the way you want  to, go to the doctor
[0:56:03] Sebleh: but it’s more than that naguuraSip
[0:56:19] countrycount: @Sebleh yeah..she is a moonkin main

[0:56:35] JamesOlogist: I've had social anxiety disorder  most of my life; it's brutal
[0:56:38] backdoorbufet: fail
[0:56:49] Gilgalad75: I'm 49 and struggled wtih it from age 12 to about 40. I didn't even tell my parents about it when I was a teen.
[0:57:27] Zirconn__: imagine naguura on a Dr. K session

[0:58:58] Sebleh: Naguura we’ve seen you call multiple people on the phone. it’s not that unbelievable.
[0:59:10] The90Green: Super sound !!!
[0:59:13] Zirconn__: and you’ve been barked at a few people on the phone on stream
[0:59:15] Sebleh: even your parents. it’s crazy.
[0:59:21] elldub: That's why I went to engineering school. The majority of my classmates were socially awkward. I fit right in.
[0:59:23] JamesOlogist: I totally get the phone thing, texting has changed my life lol

[1:03:40] TotallyNotRaien: no women and all the guys have never met a woman
[1:03:44] Sebleh: Ngl I went to engineering school and the majority of my classmates were outgoing as hell. there was also a lot of women (maybe 1/3 were women) it was so unlike what people said it would be. naguuraSip
[1:03:50] elldub: Yeah, I had multiple classes with no other women too.
[1:04:00] amon2124: Awkwardception
[1:04:35] elldub: But I had two brothers close in age, maybe that helped me? idk
[1:04:57] Oriosis: we found dove in a soapless place
[1:07:08] Zirconn__: I had a similar experience before I dropped out
[1:07:23] TotallyNotRaien: 1/3 is only 1/3 riveting commentary
[1:07:34] Zirconn__: the engineering bros who were outgoing were the most degenerate fucks I’ve seen
[1:07:51] TotallyNotRaien: never trust men that are charismatic
[1:07:55] TotallyNotRaien: never trust men really
[1:07:55] Sebleh: yeah there was tons of women in my engineering classes, specially in the civil and electrical disciplines.
[1:08:02] elldub: Way back in the 90's when I was in engineering school, there were a lot more women in chemical and civil engineering.
[1:08:07] Elembry_us: @Sebleh I wish I had your luck. Not many women and the men were so awkward. You'd think most of them had never spoken to the opposite sex.
[1:08:25] Sebleh: I actually met one of my closest friends there and we vibed because she’s from my home town. I went to her wedding in October seblehShy
[1:08:25] Zirconn__: my aerospace program was 50/50 male:female
[1:08:33] elldub: My electrical engeering classes didn't have many women at all

[1:09:34] DoubleProGG: thought i missed a whole day : D
[1:09:42] TotallyNotRaien: like society has to ration their women in stem
[1:09:43] Elembry_us: Engineering schools are typically low on women. I went to an engineering school.
[1:09:43] TotallyNotRaien: lol
[1:09:46] Sebleh: aerospace was def dominated by women at UF lmao
[1:09:54] Sebleh: no but 1/3 women in engineering is still huge
[1:10:02] Zirconn__: no shot me and sebleh went to the same uni
[1:10:03] Elembry_us: That's true
[1:10:06] Zirconn__: small world
[1:10:06] Sebleh: considering that 10 years before it was probably like 1/10
[1:10:19] Gamerhcp: shes calling you old chat
[1:10:26] Elembry_us: I was an engineering major until I changed it. Being the only female in a class was... interesting.
[1:10:27] Sebleh: I was there ‘13-‘15 @zirconn__

[2:21:47] Teraision: It is a panini when u put it into the panini press YEP
[2:22:16] vodin__: It has to be italian bread basically, that is just grilled and smooshed. Ciabatta, focaccia and I guess a baguette is used as well. I was wrong

[2:29:27] hayzoux: sry Naguura, gonna leave ur Stream for ur DH Tank. Banger Music there :D
[2:29:32] NkKouros: Doesn't panini just mean "small loaf of bread"? It's a bit like iPad vs tablet or jeep and 4*4
[2:29:35] Zirconn__: it just makes a sandwhich sound fancy
[2:29:36] warbarby: banger playlist, thanks for streaming!

[2:29:44] louyouknow: us what ever you want plunch it or toast it and thats it
[2:29:48] ksyunma: pane carasau karterDevil the best thing Italians made
[2:29:57] JohnAllenCasts: A panini is a type of sandwich originating from Italy, typically made with Italian bread (such as ciabatta or baguette) that is cut horizontally and filled with various ingredients such as cheese, meats (like ham or salami), vegetables (like tomatoes or roasted peppers), and condiments (such as olive oil or pesto). The sandwich is then pressed and grilled, traditionally using a panini press, until the bread is crispy and the filling is heated through.
[2:29:58] louyouknow: use
[2:30:00] JohnAllenCasts: The key characteristic of a panini is its grilled and pressed nature, distinguishing it from other types of sandwiches.

[2:30:55] Freddyfx36: just call it something that sounds italian like bachetto instead of baguette
[2:30:57] louyouknow: thats my type of humor hhahahaha
[2:31:04] Sebleh: oui the Italian baguetti
[2:31:05] Gnolde: A panini is a type of sandwich originating from Italy, made by grilling or pressing two slices of bread filled with various ingredients such as cheese, meats, vegetables, and condiments. The bread used for panini is typically a type of Italian bread like ciabatta or focaccia, which is often brushed with olive oil or butter before grilling to create a crispy texture. Panini sandwiches can be found in many different variations and are popular worldwide for their versatility and delicious taste.
[2:31:11] Zirconn__: can’t wait for the bread guy to pop into chat and lose his mind
[2:31:12] dfSyn: it's actually called a pinino
