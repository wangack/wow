[0:20:03] Nico_vdM: Hey @jdotb and chat
[0:22:54] bojackhorseman2004: Hello @jdotb i am the person from the discord
[0:31:17] Sykeasaurus: is it possible to show how many times u casted rejuv all dungeon
[0:31:18] KinoJr_: only 6 and a half long boss Pog
[0:31:38] Sykeasaurus: youre a legend man
[0:31:52] MrCrippels: when do you want to use rejuv?
[0:32:24] dragona92: NEVER KEKW
[0:33:00] tangedyn: Is rejuv no longer efficient?
[0:33:50] Nico_vdM: I had a look at the m+ timer WA and changed doti lower/upper to fall/rise, just havent tested it yet
[0:34:18] Nico_vdM: It bothers me a little that it is called lower and upper
[0:35:40] bojackhorseman2004: the discord said this streamer answeres questions

[0:36:31] midget_banana: why don’t you guys ever just finish out the 31’s or 32’s just tell feel other stuff in the dungeon out?
[0:43:05] healapotamus: @bojackhorseman2004 discord lies
[0:46:58] detectish: dont get yell better?

[1:05:04] bojackhorseman2004: @healapotamus i knew it
[1:20:36] FuruF: FuruF subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! :)
[1:21:33] Calair_: GM jb
[1:32:50] Nico_vdM: At what point will the devs decide that affixes aren't necessary any more?
[1:34:25] nellfin: @Nico_vdM realisticly it will allways be necessary unless they add more dungeons like Mists and old waycrest where your route is forcibly changed, personally i'd prefer affixes
[1:34:44] Buffiin: jb, do you know the sound name used when your targeted? it’s a whistle correct?
[1:35:07] Buffiin: is it the phone ringing?
[1:35:08] Nico_vdM: There are affixes which are annoying

[1:36:55] Nico_vdM: The phone ringing is when incorporeal adds spawn
[1:39:53] healful1: someone told me ur not supposed to use rejuv in m+
[1:40:02] healful1: like heavily
[1:41:16] ren0m: From what I've learned, you don't use it at all.
[1:48:31] ren0m: I need that sounds as a WA
[1:48:35] ren0m: When I stand in fire
[1:51:43] YoungPumper: What makes Evoker so good in M+? I haven't played since BfA so seeing Zevv be the lowest dps in every run makes me question if it's for utility.
[1:52:19] Naloc: evoker buffs all allies, it gives them loads of main stat
[1:52:39] Naloc: so everyone is doing like 20-30% more dps, thats why he does very little damage
[1:53:00] YoungPumper: Ahh I figured that's what it was. It outweighs bringing a higher DPS for the utility. Nice
[1:53:21] Naloc: its an active buff tho, he needs to hit all the time to maintain it
[1:53:28] Naloc: dont think he is just jerking around :P
[1:53:51] nellfin: would be great if they fixed the log hooks
[1:54:17] sw0ngs: group defensives help a lot in high keys too
[1:54:34] weedyy22: i just dont see how u predict dmg u get from crit the rest makes sense
[1:54:45] CubsFan007: do you think they regret making augmentation, or do you think they'll lean into it and make more support type classes/specs?
[1:55:21] nellfin: @CubsFan007 their attempt at doubling down with the disc/holy hero tree says no
[1:55:23] sw0ngs: @CubsFan007 probably regret it since they aren't having any support specs for next expansion......yet haha

[1:56:20] CubsFan007: i wouldn't mind if they made other support type specs, it would maybe allow different comps
[1:56:34] CubsFan007: but being locked into aug for high keys feels weird
[1:56:59] nellfin: @CubsFan007 you would still allways just bring the "best" one
[1:57:43] CubsFan007: @nellfin true...
[1:58:01] caradea_: not playing VI for treeboss?
[2:01:37] nellfin: i can't help but wonder why they added a support spec instead of just spreading augs abilities across the other spec that need SOMETHING to be relevant
[2:05:47] kaspagre: Hey look
[2:05:54] cajovysacok: wtf is this  AOE
[2:05:57] kaspagre: This dungeon is gated by damage not oneshots
[2:06:03] kaspagre: at some point
[2:06:40] kaspagre: This aoe happens if u dont push the phase fast enough
[2:19:34] LGhost: what was the team that he almost had for mdi?
[2:39:15] kelly_mac06: ouch

[3:54:24] Raggu2: i recently learned the augers only cast if a jugger is nearby? thats kind of a weird interaction
