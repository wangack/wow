[0:59:33] mavericks312: towel with the road map do you think its possible we see a .4 patch this xpac?
[1:00:12] shredcruuzz: it feels like the crafting knowledge system really punishes ppl who didn't have the chance or take the time to really dig into it on beta
[1:00:45] Heero_Effect: Ya seems easier to just do a M+ and raid for my gear. More fun
[1:00:50] Tamz_tv: yeah until we get guaranteed qualities on the public orders
[1:00:54] 91Niki: Sup Towelliee and chat towComfy
[1:00:59] dandridgeiii: I think on the order system they should let the crafter list what they can do and let people do personal orders that way
[1:01:23] mavericks312: or just get lucky and get the lariat pattern
[1:01:26] Ariea_Whisper: You can’t set quality on a public work order so you could get a 5star or a 3star
[1:01:30] amricatt: There's never any work orders for any of my professions.  Definitely a gap there.
[1:01:42] shredcruuzz: no limit on crafted, just on the embelllishments
[1:01:45] corvicatz: correct but can't have more than 2 with embellishment
[1:01:45] 91Niki: also yes I agree. I hate the work order system as someone who wants a work order done
[1:01:51] Tamz_tv: you can only have 2 embellished pieces but I think other than that you can have full crafted
[1:01:59] Sollice: I am doing Alchemy and I would like to make some money but may be late to the party lol
[1:02:00] Tamz_tv: just timegated by the sparks
[1:02:05] robertjordan83: @Towelliee only two embellishments but some gear counts as an embellishment automatically
[1:02:14] snake_like: crafting has some rough edges, but I'm liking it this expansion
[1:02:54] Sollice: @91Niki Really? I like it wish it was used more but I may not have good enough recipes but i crafted some today and was like cool

[1:03:34] shredcruuzz: for all the faults i think the crafting knowledge has, i think crafting is in the best spot its been in several expacs
[1:03:37] Meanseason: apparantly if you are using the signet of titanic ring.. it doesnt count as a enbelishment,  so you can technically use 3 embelishment {assuming you crafted it w alchemical embelishment}
[1:03:54] 91Niki: @Sollice The effort I have to put in to get a work order done, unless I know a crafter, is just stupid
[1:03:55] snake_like: 10 level 16 shadowmoon burial grounds KEKW
[1:04:28] Sollice: @91Niki Yeah I could see that. still trying to figure it out. i dont like that you have to provide basically all the mats?
[1:04:57] 91Niki: @91Niki You have to for public orders only
[1:05:18] snake_like: yeah, flavor pocket doesn't count as an embellishment. very nice
[1:05:28] VoltX1: the frostfire belt
[1:05:28] Meanseason: a guildie got the fire dps rare ring from the weekly quest from doing 4 m0's  LOL  and it procced to 418 w a socket... how????  im so jealous

[1:05:41] Tiluvar: There's a belt you can craft that procs a fire effect. I used that to trigger it on my prot pally

[2:49:17] pupkat: the problem is you can't guarantee quality in a crafting order
[2:49:28] The_Dane_Train: Yeah the only way I complete the quest is to send to myself.
[2:49:30] futomara01: work orders are the biggest dissapointment so far
[2:49:31] im_n0t_jezus: yep
[2:49:34] im_n0t_jezus: easy
[2:49:35] A_New_Challenger: Yea - I guess that is what I am going to do - good call
[2:49:41] daniel85mg: what did fail that made work orders so not popular?
[2:49:56] A_New_Challenger: :)
[2:50:04] A_New_Challenger: can I just have some gold too
[2:50:07] doodksm: What killed the public work order system is the fact that you cannot garuntee a quality that you are seeking. If they want to open up professions more, they need to make it so you can specify the quality with public orders.
[2:50:09] aleck1776: I like gifts
[2:50:10] ThorH13: can't recraft public
[2:50:12] IchabodCrain: i knew from the beginning that was gonna happen. people are just gonna sit at the bench for a few hours refreshing hoping someone would put in a WO. They system only works for guild and personal
[2:50:23] The_Dane_Train: Public work order need to be able to specify quality.
[2:50:42] Alaquane: are all the easy orders sniped by bots?
[2:50:43] doodksm: Overall, this is a much better profession system than they have had.
[2:50:56] Siddydiddydo: Just communicate with people on your servers and send personal orders. I think the crafting orders not being able to be public is a good thing, it makes you interact with other people
[2:50:58] Sollice: @PeanutzTV how often will anyone ask for lowr quality
[2:51:10] citrinesoan: tneKragwa yes, this eMoji means a lot to me? like King Frog... or something whatever you want... maybe they will bring Benax back; or was it Anax? maybe old zones should be updated, i might get to play later this month or next one...
[2:51:13] smashwow: the do need to fix the quality thing on public orders though
[2:51:15] IchabodCrain: @Alaquane not enough info to say for certain, but that seems like a good reason

[2:51:37] The_Dane_Train: It is a GREAT concept. It just needs a few tweaks.
[2:51:40] Sollice: 10.5 may have some refinements
[2:51:47] A_New_Challenger: I think the set quality thing could help get some momentum in there, but still kinda a bummer. Not letting it keep me from crafting, but agree it is not hitting just yet
[2:51:54] futomara01: why would you waste gold for an item, iff you can raid and do M+??
[2:51:56] Leo7V: there also should have been a better in game explanation
[2:52:05] demonicyoshi: its nice but the economy is suffering an people dont use public they only do personal so finding someone who can make gear gets 10x harder
[2:52:18] Holysal: bc ppl only the best quality that is the issue
[2:52:22] demonicyoshi: dont use*
[2:52:22] raven_xii: JC won the lottery with Lariat lol
[2:52:30] Adventw0lf: @Towelliee The work order system is something to help supplement a social system. You can only do so much testing on a social system before it goes live
[2:52:39] citrinesoan: towBronze_HF work orders all the way im listening i am always here unless i need a warning but like i like to talk and listen to your thoughts. and watch you play and collect rare gear.

[2:52:45] Durk101: Only if u can get the drop
[2:52:52] ThorH13: the order should be stay open until the craft is maxed or times out like with the best craft being provided
[2:52:59] The_Dane_Train: I am totally blowing my points in random stuff - I wait until I see a public work order then spec into that. Which means the buyer is left with a 2-3 star because I do the basic.
[2:53:03] ThorH13: like a job bidding system
[2:53:12] mavericks312: 1.7 mil on my server fot the pattern
[2:53:13] Durk101: There are 2 people on my server with it :(
[2:53:17] GingerPurple: i farmed it for about 10 hours first 2 days and didn't see a single one drop for anybody.
[2:53:22] A_New_Challenger: I really want to be able to craft my own Alchemist Stone - used to have one back in Burning Crusade and just hit 100 got my gear...need a few more mats, but hyped
[2:53:23] Mecabeast: i have the receipe for the plate legs that give haste but i dont have the skill for beyond rank 2
[2:53:30] Zodiec: how much gold do you guys put into comission?
[2:53:36] ThorH13: 5k
[2:53:37] BriscoGDP: botany
[2:53:38] Siddydiddydo: Botany has been decent so far
[2:53:38] Kebabra_: Should go botany for mounted looting
[2:53:42] cam__: More herbs or get the more titan order thing maybe?
[2:53:43] WaymanLive: 1mil g for the lariat pattern on my server

[2:54:10] Lintgamer: @Towelliee or chat. I have 405 lariat. how do I upgrade it to 418? do i need to craft a new one?

[4:01:30] thebigcat32: not trash, but MM has significantly more burst, and I think better AOE
[4:01:41] thebigcat32: BM isn't bad, but MM is better
[4:01:44] Speshulist: I just healed a +9 on here and warrior kept standing in EVERYTHING then constantly telling me to heal him more
[4:01:45] im_capy: My wife dies enough for me to now know I am the one to Brez LUL
[4:01:46] DarkhorseSix: "tHAT Blows..... oh yeah..."

[4:03:25] Speshulist: that loot bug where it just spams over and over is so annoying
[4:03:30] Sonatta: pally
[4:04:02] Doomgarh: @OldManMaple I don't think you can go back in timewalking at Max.
[4:04:04] Speshulist: has to be a higher one i think
[4:04:04] OldManMaple: i guess my question is how the heck can i get to kultiras,  the came disconnects when travelling by boat normally
[4:04:07] MFAM_THE_Steven: same key or lower

[4:04:41] thorsteindevelopment: azurevault 15
[4:05:08] OldManMaple: @Doomgarh ah ok,  so the best option is make a new toon and be 1 level below max to go back and unlock stuff?
[4:05:13] Doomgarh: bye hunter!
[4:05:27] OldManMaple: @Doomgarh essentially make a "time walking" toon?
[4:05:31] zeiours: @towelliee awe
[4:05:44] Doomgarh: You can do that or look take boat or pick up quest maybe from Board.
[4:05:50] zeiours: @towelliee how do I watch your vod from yesterday, last one was 4 days ago

[4:07:17] 3663Sharad: Getting gear feels super slow in DF. Especially now with the stretched out ilvl. Maybe Blizz should increase the drops to 3 again? @Towelliee
[4:07:21] GingerGambit: I’ve only seen it once and it was a low key
[4:07:26] LouisWu73: i've run HOV over 10 times and not a single peice of loot for me, all orbs

[4:10:03] Sollice: Maybe the bow but I have a storm bow
[4:10:09] Hammerify: @Towelliee have you looked into the Frostfire belt to work with the Fire proc ring? How would this work, I don't quite understand frostfire
[4:10:26] ErkTheMighty: I mean, technically you ARE a prot main, just not pally lol

[4:11:26] Hammerify: LFR eggnog drops the ring yeah
[4:11:36] Sollice: Is there a wormhold like this in DF?
[4:12:35] Doomgarh: Good luck have fun! Cya later. @Towelliee
[4:12:48] Exxcar: @Sollice there is but it requires a ton of knowledge points to make it actually usefull
[4:12:58] Sollice: Ahh okl
[4:13:04] Exxcar: otherwise its a completely random teleport to somewhere in the isles
[4:13:13] lessislol: you just hero this pull

[4:14:35] DudeknightTV: monkaS
[4:14:40] coldarmorTBG: Do you think prot pally or blood DK is more fun?
[4:14:40] luxsis_: luxsis_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[4:15:13] im_capy: almost worth the risk just being at the start of the dungeon still regardless
[4:15:37] DisparagingTurtle: Dk is too scary imo
[4:15:46] widepeepooohappy: @coldarmorTBG prot is more fun for sure, dk is way stronger
[4:15:53] DisparagingTurtle: going from 90% ho to 10% back to 100 in less than 4 GCDs is scary
[4:15:54] im_capy: prot pally just is so flashy, that alone is fun imo

[4:17:02] HoboFighter2: What is the addon for the plain text mythic stuff?

[4:53:03] citrinesoan: i really respect your guild.
[4:53:34] fistofnature: please fix your mog NotLikeThis
[4:53:56] Reckless_Monk: well until you get geared out
[4:54:09] karmakush420: 150k is still a shit ton of  follows gg
[4:54:10] abracka_: that's the giga chad mog, don't hate
[4:54:15] gali5656: pretty depressing when you get someone who isnt prepared for a key in your group lol
[4:54:27] Aidler: that’s why I stay away from M+ as far as I can. not a pleasant experience
[4:54:30] Reckless_Monk: Thats because people are fucking toxic
[4:54:31] gritbarontv: there should be a heavy penalty for leaving, lol
[4:54:35] TwistedetaF: Anyone know what weak aura hes using for stats?
[4:54:41] Danskis30: why i see adds ?
[4:54:42] illusion1990: It also has to do with people chasing score and not gear. No point in staying if you score wont increase
[4:54:52] koldar_nemesis: true that. I can confirm on low keys people rarely leave
[4:55:01] Larc9783: Reduce their IO score
[4:55:09] koldar_nemesis: usually people on low keys are more chill
[4:55:26] Fero814: majority of group has to agree to disband the key??
[4:55:31] pereadin: yeah i'll go on paladin for that one lol
[4:55:33] Irhamel: even if they added a debuff like the dungeon deserter, it wouldnt really change a thing, unless the debuff is several hours long.

[4:55:46] xandroidx16: do u get more score for week 3 on io? oh is it just for the first 2 weeks.
[4:55:49] Reckless_Monk: Sheeesh H gear
[4:55:54] koldar_nemesis: @Larc9783 the problem with reducing the IO is people will become more picky when applying to groups
