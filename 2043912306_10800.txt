[3:23:05] HappysFunPalace: take pokemon go - it wasnt made by gamefreak so it was a different genre, i think gamefreak only does like shitty rpgs so they dont see this as competition

[4:27:07] Trodenskjold: They should have removed your prio when they banned your ass
[4:27:07] DecentlyGaming: and goes through gpus due to the amount it uses
[4:27:08] damroyalty: yupp ive burned so many nvidia GPUS mining @Graycen
[4:27:11] Spikeqc: graycen only mines monero cuz he a real cypherpunk
[4:27:27] simzz9999: Back in the days ppl used to build huge rig just to farm bitcoin but now its worthless electricity is higher than rentability
[4:27:27] Trodenskjold: Mining bitcoins is like Esmount
[4:27:30] damroyalty: too much to explain on a simple chat
[4:27:37] damroyalty: \but you verify bitcoinn transactions
[4:27:41] DecentlyGaming: it doesnt, yet here we are. Printing money makes sense though?
[4:27:51] simzz9999: Mining = running program using gpu
[4:27:51] damroyalty: miniers get paid for providing energy/network
[4:27:53] mharding8: 100,000 in student loans, don't forget it. to be this dumb :)

[4:27:56] Spikeqc: @Graycen basically compute intensive operations and the first one to guess it correctly gets the money
[4:28:01] damroyalty: & verifies transactions
[4:28:07] IIIIllIlll: in a nutshell mining bitcoin is just solving a very complicated math problem
[4:28:11] DecentlyGaming: OMEGADANCE government can just print trillions
