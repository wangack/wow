[5:52:36] Nerendis: Literally the largest Alliance and horde coalition - who has zero streamers in it - play on Crusader. Super disingenuous to blame asmon etc.

[5:53:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Whew that was close!
[5:53:19] ZephForShort: As someone who plays alliance on Crusader Strike I can say that they really mucked things up for us. The amount of alliance vs horde is way in hordes favor just because of the streamer followers that came for a day or two and then left

[5:57:39] MisterPeace: i belive its s crime where im at
[5:57:42] Nerendis: I mean it's basically fraud
[5:57:44] Aethn: in some states yeah

[5:58:07] Aidler: eBay should easily be able to detect if the same people bit on anything someone sells but never win
[5:58:13] Rokaden: Thats murica for you.
[5:58:18] RogueDogg: Shill bidding may also be considered a form of wire fraud, which is a federal offense under 18 U.S. Code Section 1343. Maximum penalties for the crime of wire fraud can include two decades imprisonment
[5:58:26] ProClicker: WutFace
[5:58:31] Aethn: yup its exactly that, an attempt to defraud your customer for gain
[5:58:55] danoh_64: Oh yea. Some big time seller got time for shill bidding. Can't remember who though.
[5:59:22] cyrex172: how do they detect that on ebay.  pretty advanced ip detection
[5:59:24] Faelightning: Faelightning subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Good morning Towelliee!
[5:59:51] Broseidon0: Im just wanting to join a more populated server so its to get groups and shit
[6:00:08] MisterPeace: “Recently, it was determined that individuals associated with a trading card seller, PWCC, have engaged in “shill bidding,” which is prohibited on eBay,” the statement read.   looks like ebay watches people
[6:00:10] Nerendis: I mean, they prove insurance fraud, stock fraud, and other forms of sneaky as shit things. IP detection is not the only way I feel like
[6:00:15] Aethn: it would likely need to be a pattern over a number of auctions to really make it stick
[6:00:25] danoh_64: Takes a lot of work but they can get you.
[6:00:25] cyrex172: @Broseidon0 what serv u on? wild growth is packed
[6:00:34] deanbeo: Yes
[6:00:47] deanbeo: Gnatlpine
[6:00:49] danoh_64: Yea that's it PWCC
[6:00:50] FrylockOG: A source said it is believed that PWCC did at least $200 million worth of gross sales on eBay in the last year alone.
[6:00:50] ScintiWeiWei: as long as the evidence supports it, most lawyers can prove anything guilty
[6:00:52] CeruleanStar: asmon says if ou aint cheatin you aint tryin
[6:01:00] ScintiWeiWei: or innocent as well
[6:01:08] alphabot357: That's why they aren't on eBay, they got perma band.
[6:01:09] MisterPeace: they removed pwcc selling ablility for a while
[6:01:31] cyrex172: @CeruleanStar that sounds like something asmon would say lol
[6:01:34] alphabot357: @MisterPeace Oh are they back on eBay?
