[0:44:09] StandardOut: Im well out a school but have a fond memory. I stayed up super late gaming in high school. The next night I fell asleep at like 5pm from exhaustion. I woke up at 7:45 (PM) and didnt think about it and got dressed rapidly and was running out of the house when I saw everyone eating dinner. STill laugh at myself
[0:44:10] Pheiro: Woah woah woah
[0:44:11] ryannschwab: buddy casually flexing his success in school and streaming at the same time while trying to downplay it sheesh
[0:44:11] jeneraljelly: College in USA is giga scam LOL
[0:44:12] Udenwo: Business degree is super versatile, that's why I did it
[0:44:15] bogartblind: Life is a scam
[0:44:15] Quanticblend: College can be depend on your degree I think
[0:44:15] leiron_10: reacts !!!
[0:44:18] RedDawg_06: @nezzy243 his banana pancake recipe is fire
[0:44:19] thottiepippen: it's a safety net in a shitty economy that's about it
[0:44:19] Quanticblend: Atleast for me it was a scam
[0:44:19] dungeonkeysyt: life experience at the least
[0:44:20] darkwingduck06: 100% scam
[0:44:22] Valivandra: college is a scam at least starting fresh out of hs.
[0:44:22] Xurkeee: whats good xar
[0:44:22] Pheiro: Can we save the college slander for 3 more months until I graduate lmao
[0:44:22] SoCal_Badfish: scam to get ya in debt
[0:44:22] TyThompson: college 100% a scam
[0:44:27] Nezzy243: @RedDawg_06 noted
[0:44:28] Kazunya_Meowryu: Do you find it sad that Pikaboo got rid of Levi? :(
[0:44:29] NinoLaRue: after that slight flex *4.0 Gpa*
[0:44:30] Jayrobes: having a degree won’t close any doors but it can open doors.
[0:44:31] zagecssss: as it should be lol
[0:44:31] Maximus92637: Have an MBA and can confirm I didn’t learn jack shit in college. ya learn more in the first 6 months of work
[0:44:31] GotLuck: I don't think college is a scam, I think the loans are
[0:44:32] oktobermist: priorities straight
[0:44:38] jarketv: it's only not a scam if u need the degree like being a doctor
[0:44:43] Mak_1_: I went to uni in England. the biggest waste of money. great fun, but a waste of time @xaryu
[0:44:49] Knocktoff: are you going to have your son prioritize rank one over school
[0:44:49] TyThompson: @jarketv true
[0:44:50] timeless_potato: MMEOWDY  MMEOWDY
[0:44:51] stankylank: if you need a specific type of skillset college can be good (doctors, lawyers, etc), otherwise its a lot of BS classes and waste of money

[0:45:14] Xvinnivx: Rank #1 Minecraft player? xD
[0:45:14] stormlightcookie: na student loans are sooooo dumb
[0:45:18] mafiasheep: what happened with levi?
[0:45:21] Madmaxx777: while i do think that colleges are allowing themselves to bloat out of control and passing along too much cost to students, I vastly prefer a world where people learned some things they "didn't care about" and became more well rounded. You don't get as easily if your schooling ends at high school
[0:45:21] Nezzy243: can get a degree whenever could only get tyrannical glad once
[0:45:28] Pheiro: Im gonna have to grind out SoDcore while I finish out this semester

[0:45:33] Voltzxy: did barny post?
[0:45:34] Cant0n: @Madmaxx777 This
[0:45:40] elydas899: idk, feel like i may have lucked out but think my CS degree was largely responsible in getting me a good career
[0:45:42] keweiy: the key is to start your career early. dont get too much crazy with education. look xaryu started investing into pvp skills early now he is profiting
[0:45:47] NinoLaRue: @madmaxx777 hot take. 👏🏻👏🏻 I agree
[0:46:03] biggacheeks: grand marshal vibes hits different 2004
[0:46:09] RedDawg_06: if a member of the move goes down are you taking the spot?
[0:46:15] parsingzero: Have to say this, kind of new to watching your stream regularly and for the first time since Byron(reckful) I feel like I've found someone that really enjoy just listening to. Keep up the great work brother.
[0:46:20] kyomaiku: kyomaiku subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Whats up Xaryu! Have a great Stream! Crushing my diet goals...down 10 pounds and looking to continue...Going to grab your bodyweight book!
[0:46:20] DashKT: You can't get a real job without college though
[0:46:21] Leviosor: Anyone go to med school here? worth the debt?
[0:46:22] graziNNN: computer science?
[0:46:23] oktobermist: College teaches bare minimum skills that get you in the door for higher tier jobs imo
[0:46:25] luckdog55: College is a scam unless your going to be a doctor, engineer or lawyer
[0:46:25] kajjind: what do you do outside of wow and working out?
[0:46:25] bogartblind: got an accounting job. If ur degree sucks it's a waste lol
[0:46:26] Cant0n: I loved college. But I dont think every student is committed and that every degree does much (MBAs....)
[0:46:26] DylanP3: I dont regret it but im in medicine so theres only one option
[0:46:26] Ser_Khan: your chances of social mobility is proven to just be much higher with a degree, not sure what there is to discuss
[0:46:28] fromyum: people who benefitted from college arent in a twitch chat at noon on a weekday
[0:46:29] Corwynn_2: college was mostly a scam for me. but i met a lot of good people that helped me get my career start so cant complain
[0:46:31] MrStLouis68: self taught, went into tech. degree only required to pass the hiring gates KEKW
[0:46:32] markaimfire_: Got a bio degree. I have never used it. Went into contracting
[0:46:32] Deomas11: Degrees that teach techincal skills are great - otherwise I agree with you
[0:46:33] IronCatastrophe: Math degree was a great choice for me.
[0:46:34] phaentompoet: i loved college as an experience, and i love learning, but in terms of career and money it was definitely a scam
[0:46:35] elydas899: Its hard to get into, but this was before the big boom with ppl trying to get into development. around 2017
[0:46:37] snugglefistsgaming: Hard Sciences you go to school for, philosophy and soft sciences will not pay for themselves.
[0:46:39] ShaneiumTheCranium: I've been doing medicine for 10 years through the army, but i have to go to school to do it in civilian life lol

[0:46:50] Boruox: but what if the move needed you?
[0:46:52] bogartblind: Bio degree KEKW
[0:46:53] graziNNN: Anything involved with computers/tech, save ur money and go to youtube university
[0:46:56] H_9_K: I think it really depends on your goals and plans. If you just go to college because you feel you have to go, it will probably be uselesss
[0:46:56] mirculess: old days with xar and reckful arena streams were something special
[0:46:56] moflak: moflak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:46:57] garzzyy: some sort of schooling i feel is always good at least for socializing and seeing different views of people's perspective
[0:46:58] CubicleGangster: Got IT carts in high school back in early 2000s. Skipped college. Best decision ever.
[0:46:59] knucklez2291: The thing about uni/college imo is that it helps you broaden your way of thinking, at least from the degree I got (engineering)
[0:47:03] CubicleGangster: certs*
[0:47:03] ryannschwab: Only reason I think uni is worth it, is because many jobs require the degree. For me physio needs a masters degree. otherwise I definetly wouldnt do it
[0:47:06] summerteeth: yep philo degree, never used rip
[0:47:07] SarsonThings: I got a degree, dont use it, but needed it to get my job
[0:47:11] Mavzerick: Got a Chemistry degree, never used it
[0:47:12] RoozBoom: Hey @Xaryu, thanks for the info on AG1 yesterday. I ordered it last night after your stream via your link. Looking forward to trying it out. Been looking for a good all-rounder for a while.
[0:47:14] Madmaxx777: you're still using what you learned in college though. learning to evaluate changing requirements, allocating time, learning to survive on your own, taking direction, etc.
[0:47:15] 1shabbymn: yea, I use my CS degree daily still
[0:47:15] keredj: The "college experience"
[0:47:18] expbottles: I got my bachelors in communications
[0:47:22] Kazunya_Meowryu: Yea one of my friends got an internship at Microsoft, they said they learnt alot more at the internship than his whole time at college
[0:47:25] tb_chelios: idk, all my friends who went to uni (i live in europe) use their degree and work in that field rather successfully
[0:47:25] TheRealiMachine: Yeah, studied business, wotking in IT...
[0:47:26] MrHehx: HexzHybrid subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:47:26] markaimfire_: Very true. That or a trade
[0:47:30] NinoLaRue: I got a Psychology degree with a minor in chemical dependency. feel like although I went on a different career route, it still applies to my day to day🤌
[0:47:33] StandardOut: University taught me "what a hammer is, and its intention" but rarely did I get taught "how to use said tool". For Computer Science grads, you are expected to learn "How".
[0:47:35] bogartblind: Aka Mitch
[0:47:36] elydas899: @moflak This is absolutely true for me too, I think CS degrees are for teaching fundamentals not so much teaching applications of theory
[0:47:38] drumminbacon: don’t listen to a streamer who was spoonfed about life advice people
[0:47:42] largist_: about your books @xaru, are they digital download or physical, was thinking of getting the bundle but ahipping to EU is mess
[0:47:43] mirculess: old days with xar and reckful arena streams were something special
[0:47:44] Mahca_: one of my teachers always said a degree shows that you can finish something if nothing else
[0:47:44] The_palumbo: You learn much more DOING what you learned, than just from learning it.
[0:47:49] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[0:47:51] Kazunya_Meowryu: : Yea one of my friends got an internship at Microsoft, they said they learnt alot more at the internship than his whole time at college
[0:47:51] iRayG2: xar what sports would you put kai in?
[0:47:51] TheEndIsNear777: @drumminbacon HUH
[0:47:51] Cant0n: I think its a mistake to treat college as just a professionalization program. You're supposed to grow as a person
[0:47:51] berserage95: spending 50k+ and 4 years so an employer can think "hey he did something to 4 years" LUL
[0:47:52] tylive52: hello mr employer xaryu has been addicted to wow for more then 4 years xD
[0:48:00] Figggs: what realm is sod hardcore if you dont mind me asking @Xaryu

[0:48:07] garzzyy: some of my closest relationships came in college, met my wife too
[0:48:08] supersuhmz: imo, the only time it’s worth going to college is f your desired career is locked behind an undergrad, something like physiotherapy, law, medicine, or clinical psychology
[0:48:10] jacobderbauer: My best friend became a long haul trucker and is gonna take home like $140k this year
[0:48:11] Jayrobes: learning a trade is hard work though for sure. going to be working holidays and stuff
[0:48:20] Figggs: ty <3
[0:48:20] Kazunya_Meowryu: Yea one of my friends got an internship at Microsoft, they said they learnt alot more at the internship than his whole time at college
[0:48:28] vanella15: are you waiting on something?
[0:48:32] Wulsiac: there are some basics/backgrounds you dont lear while doing it that are really hard to catch up if you never went to college imo

[0:48:36] gritgodgaming: Do You Remember a character named uzak on thunderlord
[0:48:37] Ervill1: Kai will be AG1 scientist to develop new formulas

[0:49:01] keredj: My life is twitch TV still haha
[0:49:01] AamiraCat: Many companies ONLY hire college degree candidates. Reality: most with a degree have no idea how to do the job lol
[0:49:02] kyomaiku: Same here. Meet my wife in Java Programming class. We got our computer science degrees and both are currently working in the IT industry.
[0:49:04] Ethan_Alexander_: happy Tuesday @xaryu had to put my cat down this morning. glad you’re streaming today…
[0:49:04] markaimfire_: You been keeping up with playoff football xar?

[0:49:09] keweiy: that was your future career and you started doing it very early
[0:49:13] ikuze: me watching u was college

[0:49:16] keweiy: so much value in that
[0:49:17] retpallytrash: Why are you so much better at mage than Mitch
[0:49:22] xwowkillax: frog university Pog @xaryu
[0:49:22] The_palumbo: met my wife day one of college hahaha we didn't date til a few months in though
[0:49:26] Ervill1: exposed

[0:49:31] Jayceza: do you use your degree?
[0:49:34] iRayG2: xarSleeper
[0:49:34] FurylordD: xaryu do you know if the devs of the hardcore addon will be allowing us to spam bfd every 3 days?
[0:49:34] PuffnTuff: most people just go to college to be in debt lol
[0:49:40] Madmaxx777: You're also paying a ton for the service and you can be upset at the outcome
[0:49:41] handovdoom666: I was a "non-traditional student". Did 6 years, class from 8-10:45, worked 11:30-8. Started when I was 34, graduated at 39. 3.5 GPA.
[0:49:48] bralter: college is a scam i missed 0 classes and paid attention and still use 0 of what i learned
[0:49:48] AnxiousKitty: I failed my first semester of college by playing too much league.
[0:49:54] freddan92: Did you really graduate top of your class?
[0:49:56] twbezerks: Will you ever get rav to teach you how to play league of legends
[0:49:59] junkedup: tradeschool is the new bachelors degree
[0:50:03] Ser_Khan: did you actually graduate top of your class
[0:50:03] xwowkillax: 24 hour EZ Clap
[0:50:15] xNotorietyx: The difference is you dont retain any of that info
[0:50:18] Jayrobes: trades are good. but be ready to work your ass off and be tired after
[0:50:21] Leviosor: YO TEACH
[0:50:22] xwowkillax: y not DansGame
[0:50:23] Cant0n: Yeah but you basically made that career choice early rather than growing via coursework. Which is fine, but yea
[0:50:23] keredj: Lol

[0:50:32] PuffnTuff: LUL
[0:50:34] freddan92: Did you really graduate top of your class?
[0:50:34] NinoLaRue: you had no control over the curriculum tho! just because you are taking your “preferred course” doesn’t mean you don’t have BS classes like to take that mean NOTHING
[0:50:35] steasyqt: It's not really about the quitting, they just want you to be able to learn stuff in a short period of time and have capability to understand complex stuff. + you know how to do your research on scientific level
[0:50:35] Kinnoli: in my mind it's more about doing something you're passionate about. if that involves going to college, you'll probably be successful with it. But if you went to college because your parents/society told you to, it likely went nowhere.
[0:50:35] xwowkillax: D:
[0:50:36] partakone66: bruv you are a BUSSINESS OWNER the school beign shit teached you to be an bussiness owner

[0:50:47] Pixiepantss: Essaying sheesh chatters
[0:50:49] markaimfire_: Professor I was trying to help mitch pursue the arcane dream*
[0:50:49] garzzyy: maybe college life gave you the time/lifestyle to stream easier than being at home trying to stream? who knows if you would have streamed more next to the parents and around the highschool lifestye
[0:50:54] marvinmc420: @Xaryu did you get your masters ??
[0:50:56] lizardboiy: say the cume

[0:51:30] sydneystraya: Thought you were 40 😂
[0:51:33] stankylank: college isnt exactly the place to learn being a successful streamer lol

[0:52:02] oktobermist: @Xaryu Master's programs getting B's is basically failing. They're straight scams for most part lol
[0:52:03] Kazunya_Meowryu: Xaryu when is the next Wordle with shannon?
[0:52:04] hdee12: have you ever had a job  outside of wow/twitch?
[0:52:06] shadwarform: xar do you have a guide on how to start streaming?
[0:52:07] Deomas11: It's not about the learning, it's about the people you meet.
[0:52:07] Skriptmonkey: I ended up dropping out of college with "Magna Cum Numb Nuts".
[0:52:09] Udenwo: Honestly you learn way more your first year on the job, than you do in 4 years of college
[0:52:12] dungeonkeysyt: i had a pottery teacher that went back for her masters to get like 8k more per year. Seems worth in that scenario
[0:52:13] Mavzerick: Master's was a scam, applied for a job that required a master's degree...they ended up hiring a person with a Bachelors
[0:52:16] ShotFake: PhD is free though
[0:52:18] kaboom987: I got a masters and it totally wasnt a scam, got me a higher job and pay. Keep in mind in in Canada and it cost me 3.5k total, not USA
[0:52:19] Cant0n: Finishing my PhD so hard for me to agree with a lot of this xarNerdge
[0:52:21] NinoLaRue: @xaryu if you never hurt your back, you think you would have EVER played wow? forget streaming
[0:52:25] strobe9312: How many hours total streaming from the start?
[0:52:32] Madmaxx777: Youre a great teacher, think procedurally, passion for fitness, you'd make a great trainer

[1:11:47] BlackRe3per: huh?
[1:11:50] marvinmc420: @Xaryu what about , new servers and merge when they die ?
[1:11:52] meepo604: @m3ntal0 loving it, heard its only worth if you're series 6 or less though
[1:11:53] ProClicker: When Reckful first started streaming he wore a hoodie and didn't speak to chat 1 word
[1:11:57] StandardOut: Except the main server AH is so overrun with gold.
[1:11:59] Knocktoff: it is horrible
[1:12:00] victoray33: whats the best profession for money making?
[1:12:02] Donho2: in SSF is server pop important?
[1:12:03] Dracconfoo: its bad

[1:12:18] bm01: 100% that guy's

[1:12:35] PhoenixPresence: Dragons breath is op
[1:12:38] twitchara7: water ele bis
[1:12:40] curedubs: didnt really find the post creative and innventive
[1:12:40] Greynoise14: yeah not sure who *voted* This list is kind out of touch
[1:12:40] Ervill1: one guy decided this is what he wants and made an article LUL
[1:12:43] twbezerks: Would if blizzard added an streamer only server like they had darkspear back in the day of retail
[1:12:47] stormlightcookie: tbc db would be fine
[1:12:47] berserage95: imagine if they made new abilities LUL bare minimum
[1:12:47] SillyPanda: Maybe unpopular take- runes shouldn't be retail abilities. It's supposed to be new stuff lol
[1:12:50] flopopopop: DEEP FREEZE
[1:12:52] giantgreendoor: Reaction time?
[1:12:53] PhoenixPresence: But they are just adding spells from retail into classic tbh
[1:12:56] MarkSterlingESQ: what is your plan for p2?  mage first?
[1:12:56] ARROWli: WHAT UP XAR!
[1:12:59] GGunni: are you gonna start HC or normal sod on p2?
[1:13:00] PhoenixPresence: I agree with that @SillyPanda
[1:13:01] spookylock: !sodcore
[1:13:01] Rabellious: Are you back to your other realm when P2 comes out?
[1:13:01] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[1:13:10] apexariestv: I’m ready too hunt you down
[1:13:10] zagecssss: deep freeze my fav spell ever
[1:13:18] josephpeat: Iconic abilities plus new ones would be great imo
[1:13:20] marvinmc420: Deep freeze would be INSANE
[1:13:20] acey1994: which mage spec for P2 xar?
[1:13:21] berserage95: sod cant even make any new zones LUL just rehashing retail or classic dungeons
[1:13:21] Shawk_23: Only fangs still ongoing?
[1:13:22] Ociroza: hey whats a good GEARSCORE to have in SOD?
[1:13:23] NickAle006: xaryu what do I gotta do to get in this bfd run? just made my sodcore too
[1:13:26] marvinmc420: then ice lance finally works
[1:13:26] the_iamiam: do you have any advice for starting strewamers?
[1:13:29] ARROWli: HAHA ITS ALRIGHT MAN! WISH THERE WAS MORE PVP CONTENT
[1:13:31] NickAle006: toon*
[1:13:31] jacksunson: Dont you feel bad for the tiny plan competing with the big plant in the same pot
[1:13:32] Jessrabbit1: living bomb + icelance

[1:13:48] Ebsoni: not a single aoe/instant healing rune for holypaladins. what a stupid wishlist
[1:13:48] Badbotqt: unless they put deep freeze on the same gear piece
[1:13:49] Gedorlol: dont do it
[1:13:51] beeweetv_: don't do it
[1:13:53] beeweetv_: lol
[1:13:53] VesperalTV: grow your stream outside of twitch
[1:13:53] claynukem: Schedule

[1:14:00] stormlightcookie: be good at something
[1:14:02] berserage95: advice for starting streamers: dont ask for advice LUL
[1:14:07] jukeski_og: create more instagram reels than you stream
[1:14:08] markaimfire_: a lot of luck involved.Especially now
[1:14:11] rawlexdota: Luck is part of the consistency
[1:14:11] keredj: true
[1:14:15] willy_away: stream 15 hours a day for years to noone Lol
[1:14:15] RedDawg_06: what would you tell young xar if you could go back in time
[1:14:17] MarkyOchoa: Didn't Ludwig prove it was skill?
[1:14:18] realglazed: like hardcore wow for you
[1:14:20] wlzzard_: Hey Xar just wanted to say that I appreciate ur work man, always nice to tune in!
[1:14:21] calvescere: If you check a category and scroll down its like thousands of people with 1 viewer. Its so hard growing
[1:14:24] ShinerG: quit. get a real job instead
[1:14:24] ItsPummel: preparation meets experience
[1:14:28] sarrgasso: phase 3-4 runes means they will have to retune level 60 raids
[1:14:34] Badbotqt: advice ; dont self promote on others streams
[1:14:38] savagedabs4623: you have to be entertaining as well, being good at a game isnt enough.
[1:14:40] DrDreadFool: Hello xaryuuu
[1:14:43] loweery: just enjoy it
[1:14:47] sarrgasso: a hobby
[1:14:47] supertact: keys to being a popular streaming. be really good at a game. be lucky. have a great personality. or be a hot girl
[1:14:49] octTah: octTah subscribed with Prime. 
[1:14:51] NelsonGamingShow: wtf
[1:14:51] Kazunya_Meowryu: Do you think starting streaming when you are 28
[1:14:53] PKCoalTrain: that's just the truth
[1:14:54] WHOisTHePianoMan: start as a hobby
[1:14:54] berserage95: nowadays u need to leech off a bigger streamer
[1:14:55] strasburgakadolph: says the millionaire :P
[1:14:55] zzcynic: It wouldnt be genuine and would feel like a job
[1:14:58] winningfob: true
[1:14:59] Hellacat: its such a new concept too
[1:15:01] DrDreadFool: You gotta be part of the 1% to make it
[1:15:06] DrDreadFool: That's incredibly hard
[1:15:06] Ociroza: @Xaryu what is the average
[1:15:08] letsgoforsen123: but asmon is a billionaire
[1:15:11] luzid7: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:15:11] asphyxiiaTV: STREAM FOR FUN AND PASSION MAN DANG
[1:15:15] calvescere: as a hobby
[1:15:21] willie_stroker_99: Just be rich and stream for fun
[1:15:23] keredj: Facts
[1:15:23] bralter: streamers are entertainers, what sets you apart from the thousands who have already done it. you have to find what makes you yourself if you just want to play games streaming isnt for you
[1:15:26] kfc_manager11: Based take
[1:15:38] meepo604: and then one day you MIGHT, MMMMMIGHT, one day have more than 5 viewers
[1:15:39] capitanrikko: the average streamer does not have 1000 Subscribers x4$... if you have those u are fine i guess>?
[1:15:41] markaimfire_: @Kazunya_Meowryu There are a lot of established streamers who didn't start until their late 30s. never too late
[1:15:42] pinkos4thestate: Alot of the big streamers generate revenue damn near more outside of stream than anything
[1:15:43] ipntheshower: Quiting your day job to stream is a huge gamba
[1:15:45] imvecks: Its so competitive, if u go for it for Money, ur gonna be disappointed
[1:15:45] Dowsha_tv: @Xaryu  BUt the average streamer is not 100% committed to beocme big. IF your goal is to become big you can sepperate form the average by going all out
[1:15:51] cheezywiz: Rav is a great example of doing streaming part time rn
[1:15:53] ItsPummel: my channel is tiny and twitchtracker has it in top 0.6% its insane how competitive the space is
[1:15:54] Coorslite619: good analogy
[1:15:55] Drakazagra: There is alot of NBA players like that too
[1:15:59] Sanrearte: !sodcore
[1:16:00] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[1:16:00] Badbotqt: as long as you’re not in WNBA
[1:16:03] BlackRe3per: it’s harder now tho with how much jobs want you to work
[1:16:05] Chomaxx: you make total sense, very logical
[1:16:07] twbezerks: Yeah all the big streamers nowadays did streaming for fun and they share what they love
[1:16:14] PKCoalTrain: big true, 90% of the people who play basketball do not become professional athletes
[1:16:15] autotoon: but you can't leech basketball skills
[1:16:15] chrislu18: It's like being a musician. So hard to make money in music. But people do it because they love it. And if something comes out of it, great!
[1:16:21] maplemakz: i actually love that comparison
[1:16:21] Rabellious: Lowkey makes sense
[1:16:25] marvinmc420: rwhoooosh
[1:16:27] ImShmoly: @PKCoalTrain more like 99.999%
[1:16:32] Ebsoni: Ive been wanting to start streaming for a long time. I used to stream wotlk arenas with Xfire but never started twitch. Turning 30 this year, i think its too late now.
[1:16:33] StandardOut: Come online as a WoW mega streamer for WoW Vanilla. Then come off as a pseudo-republican and chat all day giving opinions lack rigidity. Then open a SunAnvil PC company.
[1:16:34] ziloxity_: its comparable
[1:16:35] asphyxiiaTV: DO IT FOR FUN AND PASSION yerrr
[1:16:36] Kazunya_Meowryu: @markaimfire_ guzuL guzuL guzuL
[1:16:38] Cant0n: It kinda makes sense. Most basketball players arent making  NBA money. Even pro ones in other countries' leagues
[1:16:39] Rush187: the chances i think are the same
[1:16:40] luckyfueldk: Than is only money you want not for the passion
[1:16:41] Totemsqt: I love it when I take a super clean poop, and I don’t even have to wipe @xaryu
[1:16:41] mr_raygun1: @Dowsha_tv you dont know what the average streamer looks like casue the average streamer doesnt get shown in the reccomended
[1:16:41] spiritsland: its a good analogy, anything worth something is going to take time and dedication
[1:16:43] SweatyDaniels: does that mean Asmongold is Michael Jordan
[1:16:43] VesperalTV: and dont just stream to grow your stream, use tiktok and youtube
[1:16:51] nezt1: Come on, no one really loves streaming
[1:16:53] nlichtner: the best streamers definitely started out of passion if you start because "money" your content is going to feel super artificial
[1:16:53] berserage95: @StandardOut lol
[1:16:53] uncleavi: that's true for every career
[1:16:54] Coorslite619: if your in it for money make an onlyfans lol
[1:16:57] calvescere: scroll down any category and its like thousands of people with 1 viewe, high competition
[1:16:59] ItsPummel: Sadge
[1:17:00] Skriptmonkey: I love video games. I think I'm pretty good. But having a career and a family makes it very hard to make that switch.
[1:17:01] the_iamiam: what do you think would make a good streamer?
[1:17:06] VesperalTV: Sadge
[1:17:07] kompany111: target pays better
[1:17:08] Reaperz_kinetic: probably a few cents an hour tbh
[1:17:09] markaimfire_: Especially after taxes
[1:17:13] Stranger2107: 3 bucks
[1:17:14] twbezerks: It's like you love playing wow xaryu and you share it with all of us
[1:17:17] TodBobertson: I play wow 12-16 hours every day. Should i start streaming?
[1:17:21] stormlightcookie: whats yours if your are not uncomfortable talking about it?
[1:17:23] LinemanR6: $54.38/hr according to google

[1:17:54] inhaledthc: 0 costs???????
[1:17:56] goatyoga420: The average Twitch hourly pay ranges from approximately $27 per hour for a Streamer
[1:17:56] Hasbulladin: PogChamp
[1:17:58] xDeathzDezignx: yeah
[1:17:58] savagekelr: streaming has no longevity. you need to establish a fan base of people willing to watch you regardless of the content because when certain things stop becoming mainstream your revenue is going to be unstable

[1:40:00] jud0sku: being a petulant child
[1:40:02] snugglefistsgaming: you need a certain personality to tank so they are usually type A
[1:40:03] thruddmyster: i just let the dps that keeps pulling to eat it
[1:40:04] kindaopmusic: They think they hvave crown on
[1:40:05] Thomasdurso: you should like my therapist lol
[1:40:05] BlinkApx: Legit tank EGO

[1:40:12] HogwartsLegacyOfficial: they take the heat for everyone
[1:40:13] Bekindorplink: it’s the one think we get todo. if you wanna pull play tank
[1:40:13] Neko4all: DOODOO
[1:40:13] daschadwick: If you let the tank dictate the run it tends to go much smoother to be fair
[1:40:16] Milchdealer: They are stressed by the responsibility
[1:40:16] sad0____: You don't realize how annoying it is to tank for idiots
[1:40:17] FurylordD: as someone who sometimes tanks, it irritates me when people overaggro
[1:40:17] grizz430: I dont tank often but I am of the opinion that you pull it you tank it
[1:40:17] keweiy: but thats a very valid point. hard to gather all mobs at least at lvl 40-50
[1:40:18] Maiqthehighking: As a tank idc if someone else pulls if we are all ready
[1:40:18] LaneWillingham: i think they are just worried abotu dying since theyre the one supposed to be taking aggro
[1:40:19] IPZANG: @Xaryu bro tank wants to pull so they can control as a tank xD threat and rage? heard of it bruh <3
[1:40:19] THUGN: main character syndrome

[1:40:22] DSheckler: hey xar
[1:40:25] jeneraljelly: Its always caster dps being toxic

[1:40:37] hebronjebron69: some people are just that miserable
[1:40:37] rollcalling: in retail...tanks are depended on for when to lust...watch cd's ...much more than just pulling and I don't blame them for being "god-complexed"
[1:40:39] DodgyThings: @Xaryu threat in classic is kinda annoying, ppl pulling ahead forces you to work harder for no real reason - just my opinion
[1:40:49] terpleyshash: ao
[1:40:53] Mister_Ript: What server is this on?  lmao
[1:41:07] jeneraljelly: @rollcalling its worse in classic where threat is an actual mechanic

[1:41:19] rollcalling: @jeneraljelly i can imagine
[1:41:24] jk_mirror: A tank in hardcore trying to be safe is responsible if not toxic. The tanks are usually the first and sometimes only to die in a wipe
[1:41:26] Meatchopper: .. I am baffled by how engaging Barny's content is .. complete focus on the content <3

[3:17:44] basedbay: mob tagging was so lame
[3:17:45] Velxir: 0% chance they all leveled on handouts and mobtagging
[3:17:46] sundaytripz: most people would make it to level 12

[3:17:47] YamajiTV: do we have a date on offcial ssf
[3:17:50] Daphud: Should turn Onlyfangs into a streamer/viewer guild. Sardaco was saying how hard it was to find a guild because hes a streamer and some of the HC guilds dont want streamers
[3:17:53] Flodden: Not 1Mil gold in donations etc...

[3:18:14] Bolt_: But then no Rav
[3:18:16] Born2Play18: but then rav would never be 60 again and ssf would never be a thing think about it so it all came how it came
[3:18:19] Duckduckgoose38: Mm mob tagging almost got me killed in STV lol
[3:18:20] ziloxity_: both his characters were boosted LUL
[3:18:22] asloff: some people dont want to go for glory in HC... xarDownbad

[4:21:13] mstr_shake: @Jukeing You don't eat either whole bean coffee or ground coffee, but you do eat either a ground chicken nug, or a fried piece of chicken. Not a great comparison. It's like saying a burger is the same as a steak.

[4:38:06] zephxqt: shield mastery is poggers, with the mana regen
[4:38:11] spunkfilleddowny: good
[4:38:11] Mavzerick: Ur DPS will be higher
[4:38:12] jeneraljelly: Molten Blast is gonna be good for the 3 pujlls in RFC
[4:38:17] zephxqt: you do enough dps with molten blast to make up for it
[4:38:20] alejandro7com: @Xaryu I heard Payo's new girlfriend is a shaman tank. She can hold aggro better than you Kappa.
[4:38:21] BigDeborahxd: higher dps tbh
[4:38:23] rmaneffa23: Hey Xar - what’s your thoughts on the carnivore diet? I’m a year in and it’s changed my life
[4:38:24] monkatos_andy: shield mastery is poggers for tanking
[4:38:24] MrPapadorgio: molten blast is a ton of dps
[4:38:27] DabRigg: Faster
[4:38:34] DabRigg: Bigger pull
[4:38:35] Puppytime: need blast for aoe threat.
[4:38:40] The_Crane: Molten blast is big cleave dmg and you'll get more magic with shield
[4:38:46] largist_: molten blast is big for levelling
[4:39:04] VesperalTV: make sure that res is on your bars
[4:39:08] themadfeltcher: Molten blast is really good damage in dungeons
[4:39:12] provender_: @xaryu enjoying shammy?
[4:39:18] Zonex2004: Fave city audio track tbh
[4:39:18] cyrusctff7: Keep earth shock rk1 for taunt.
[4:39:19] themadfeltcher: lavaburst is great for 1v1 leveling
[4:39:26] davepyo: Bro could be really slow
[4:39:26] evrgamerr: Dueling - to find out?
[4:39:28] DabRigg: Molten less downtime
[4:39:30] JohnDeeer: shield solo questing is insane
[4:39:43] DabRigg: More mana back less damage
[4:39:48] themadfeltcher: lavaburst and overload is nice for leveling even when enhance
[4:39:49] MrPapadorgio: forgot quests
[4:39:49] Puppytime: you can pull more, get a lot of mana back, and have lightning shield do dmg
[4:39:57] HansHeadshot: remember en
[4:40:10] tandre92: yea
[4:40:11] adam_brisbane: yes
[4:40:12] Kazunya_Meowryu: tru

[4:40:15] weahhc: yes
[4:40:17] grizz430: !sodcore
[4:40:17] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[4:40:18] davepyo: hmmm
[4:40:21] 775anthonymike: purge the mirage for the other tank rune
[4:40:36] weahhc: lets go
[4:40:39] fellifell: do a /roll right now for confirmation
[4:40:53] tandre92: @Xaryu  so basically crit chance on roll > flat dmg
[4:40:55] themadfeltcher: Oh BTW Xar. Hax for Sodcore. Keep purging the mirage, insta kills it, can drop greens.
[4:40:57] Mavzerick: It is MORE
[4:40:59] Nimfo: yes
[4:41:02] JohnDeeer: it's not more dps
[4:41:02] thefallen_904: it is more for sure
[4:41:04] kajjind: obv not more dps
[4:41:05] BigDeborahxd: more if you have more mobs
[4:41:08] omglookbrandon: no its not more dps
[4:41:10] MrPapadorgio: molten blast is aoe
[4:41:11] Kazunya_Meowryu: Ok do the /roll when you complete either WC or DM with him, hes free anyday this week Is it ok if deedge whispers you just to plan it out? @Xaryu
[4:41:12] omglookbrandon: copium fr
[4:41:14] rodavlasilad: lava lash?
[4:41:16] sahmatei: you have more uptime
[4:41:18] Mavzerick: The DPS on cleave pulls is insane
[4:41:18] JEM_GG: more mana though
[4:41:19] spunkfilleddowny: molten blast pumps
[4:41:19] hazuki_15: it is with more mobs
[4:41:19] Nimfo: 1hand shield is more dps and u solo level faster
[4:41:20] grizz430: you get mana back
[4:41:25] notRajha: !death
[4:41:25] StreamElements: Xar's death :( -> https://youtu.be/4DXpodwvyhw
[4:41:27] gorfang: How could it mathematically be more it u haveone less weapon?
[4:41:29] adam_brisbane: it is more for aoe packs but less for single target
[4:41:32] JEM_GG: mana gain with shield is so little tho
[4:41:33] TMMOOF: Don't forget double rockbiter
[4:41:39] evrgamerr: @StreamElements But what about Dungeons? thought there were only two - am I wrong?
[4:41:39] shuyinko123: @Xaryu u should go get molten blast!
[4:41:45] sahmatei: It's nor more dps, but it's more uptime
[4:41:46] S_Belwas: when i leveled i went for the imp healing wave. Def saved my ass a lot 10/10 would reccomend. shield and imp healing wave
[4:41:47] MrPapadorgio: 1h+ shield is really only good if you have a healer so you can face tank multiple mobs to keep the mana up
[4:41:49] JEM_GG: doesnt outweigh the tiny mana of flamestrike
[4:41:52] 775anthonymike: got to loot the key
[4:41:56] halbinder: i miss your retail pvp content
[4:41:56] adam_brisbane: wrong rune
[4:41:57] cannlbal: kill mobs
[4:41:58] itstommy22: @gorfang a lot lower hit chance when dw
[4:41:58] notRajha: did he die?

[4:42:08] adam_brisbane: KEKW
[4:42:14] largist_: shammy doesent benefit much on dual wield on lv25 and under

[4:42:33] Zonex2004: Those crits are pretty juicy every now and then
[4:42:36] wikzek: Dual wield spec rune seems imposiblle to get without engi in SSF
[4:42:39] Cauchy100: double bonk does hit diff
[4:42:42] illyiochess: damm 74 big
[4:42:44] saberign: what does the key do
[4:42:46] itstommy22: @gorfang yea I dont know the math, but I tried dw without the rune and it was horrible
[4:42:49] Venin6: Under the table
[4:42:53] Asmii: duel wield rockbiter is bis for leveling with lava lash
[4:42:53] TheMightis: DW RB,  Way of Earth, Water Shield = best dps. You can swap WS for MB, but you will have to drink often
[4:42:55] Qurco: black box under table
[4:43:01] asloff: can you imagine dual wielding in elden ring?
[4:43:06] ruttoluikero: Yeah there's dopamine alright, but theres no dopamine rush like having that lavaburst proc overload or big crit 2h swings..
[4:43:06] halbinder: why dont u play retail pvp anymore you were sooo good

[4:43:26] ryan___mcg: 😅
[4:43:29] spunkfilleddowny: ahaha
[4:43:37] gorfang: Somehow lava burst works too
[4:43:41] cannlbal: did not
[4:43:42] kazuHots: dont work mate
[4:43:42] citrusdrop9: Hast to be green or Above!
[4:43:46] TheMightis: You dont have to kill them with Earth Shock, you just need to hit them at least once with ES
[4:43:49] Zahnstocherzimtstern: need to be green
[4:43:49] Corwynn_2: they have to be green or above xar
[4:43:50] TMMOOF: Not getting inspired
[4:43:50] citrusdrop9: Inpsiration buff
[4:43:50] kazuHots: u need to kill xp mobs
[4:43:52] Kosmicpanther: why are you killing dwarves
[4:43:55] Puppytime: equip it
[4:44:00] Valencia_Pete: they cant be gray mobs
[4:44:00] rokford_: just have to earth shock once, dont have to kill them with it
[4:44:01] bewmX: it can't be the last hit
[4:44:02] TuckFelstra_: needs to give xp
[4:44:04] themadfeltcher: lavaburst overload is probably faster than lavalash for leveling 1v1
[4:44:08] saberign: u cant have rock biter
[4:44:08] DominikDB: they are grey
[4:44:08] kazuHots: yes
[4:44:08] evrgamerr: Efficient kills.
[4:44:09] OlBoris: yeah too low lvl i think
[4:44:10] hotsteamyloaf: @Kazunya_Meowryu i want to see this nude challenge
[4:44:10] cyrusctff7: Got nothing lol
[4:44:11] TheMightis: It also needs to be a mob that gives you XP
[4:44:14] Jlo1868: equipe it
[4:44:24] Kazunya_Meowryu: @hotsteamyloaf modCheck modCheck
[4:44:25] saberign: the rockbiter earth shock is different from the normal 1
[4:44:39] itstommy22: @themadfeltcher lava lash is horrendous
[4:44:50] TheMightis: @Xaryu You dont have to kill them with Earth Shock, you just need to hit them at least once with ES
[4:44:51] kaizen421: nah lava lash kinda slaps
[4:44:56] OlBoris: World first only green mobs molten blast?
[4:44:58] monkatos_andy: AINTNOWAY
[4:44:59] gorfang: This talent is broken
[4:45:01] Asmii: lava lash with double rock biter slaps
[4:45:12] cyrusctff7: Lava lash numbers all over the screen feels so good.
[4:45:13] NotoriousTWIG: LavaLash is good now if you don't fall for the FT trap and have a slow OH
[4:45:13] evrgamerr: Impossible to outsmart Bliz - like the Matrix keymaker, they hold all the keys and open all the doors - or not
[4:45:15] JohnDeeer: it will be less on 1v1
[4:45:16] kazuHots: yes
[4:45:16] Asmii: no shield is way slower
[4:45:19] Asmii: it sucks
[4:45:21] giakuzi: u be aoe blastin with molten blast
[4:45:23] DominikDB: but no flamesurge
[4:45:25] itstommy22: @kaizen421 its and extra oh attack with 6 sec cd. its aweful
[4:45:25] lokabis: Small fyi: You can't block while casting
[4:45:27] niall_9: you have to shield in dungeons
[4:45:29] Blinder_th: you can aoe farm with the tank build i found it fine!
[4:45:29] jtemp23: just level another shammy and test it
[4:45:30] S_Belwas: shield is only good with groups of mobs
[4:45:31] vicar2112: what does the shiled rune do
[4:45:31] REGEL7: xaryu, listen to yourself - think about the druild build you had in mind and it worked perfectly.
[4:45:34] cherole1: Try it LUL
[4:45:39] cherole1: much way slower
[4:45:45] gorfang: Shield is slower but u can spam shocks more with the mana from shield rune
[4:45:50] tytorrezz: f
[4:45:51] OlBoris: enha shammy will be sick at 40
[4:45:55] DominikDB: try it. you can swap shiel in cpmbat
[4:45:58] evrgamerr: Not like this..
[4:45:58] alejandro7com: Is this streamer going for the 'Dual Bonk, No Rune, Under the Table' challenge? 😄
[4:46:02] JohnDeeer: 1v1 with shield is way slower you gain dps on 2+ mobs
[4:46:03] ruttoluikero: Once you get water shield, you can burst things pretty fast with just melee and shocks. But its really, really mana intensive so you really need that water shield.
[4:46:04] themadfeltcher: I've got it on mute cause I'm in a work meeting so I'm curious what xar is saying that's making chat mad
[4:46:09] Tbiz87: sword and board is the play for hc
[4:46:12] monkatos_andy: 5Head
[4:46:12] shuyinko123: water shield is the way
[4:46:14] Kazunya_Meowryu: Ok do the /roll when you complete either WC or DM with him, hes free anyday this week Is it ok if deedge whispers you just to plan it out? @Xaryu
[4:46:16] shuyinko123: with dual wield
[4:46:18] OrganikCum: less downtime too
[4:46:20] bburton02: Also shocks on different CD.
[4:46:29] TheMightis: With the tanking Rune, Earth Shock is on a different CD than your other runes
[4:46:30] OlBoris: but is it legit tho? ;)
[4:46:31] mazz0tta: hardcore parkour, jump
[4:46:33] niall_9: get molten blast with shield and pull multiple mobs.
[4:46:38] TuckFelstra_: need to keep fire shock up to for resets on molten blast. win win
[4:46:38] thefallen_904: would you rather do a tad more dps or be way safer =D
[4:46:39] TheMightis: other shocks*
[4:46:41] JohnDeeer: yup
[4:46:43] Phoenix3215: @Xaryu stick with shield until you get blues, then switch to dw
[4:46:47] ThomasMcWinkledink: then you need to run
[4:46:48] PhoenixPresence: @Phoenix3215 twins
[4:46:56] Asmii: hold shield and swap to it when you need it
[4:47:03] DefaultBug: DefaultBug subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! yoyo
[4:47:06] S_Belwas: shield and imp healing wave
[4:47:22] saint_deniz: shield mastery with watershield and molten blast could be good. never tested it though
[4:47:26] gorfang: Shield spec + molten blast + water rune but for now lava burst will do in the gloves
[4:47:26] thefallen_904: might get lucky and get the wc shield after rfc
[4:47:27] JohnDeeer: get shield on you spellbar and swap for 2+ mobs
[4:47:27] handstand_man: you should wear a hat on stream one day then when ur serious about something take it off and say no cap Keepo
[4:47:53] Zonex2004: What just happened to those minor healing potins
[4:47:53] alejandro7com: Hardcore parkour, jump! 🤸‍♂️
[4:47:57] evrgamerr: @handstand_man oh man, thought my jokes were bad :)
[4:47:58] JohnDeeer: use shield runes lava burst sucks anyway
[4:48:00] MarqBalls: Youre not using any addons?
[4:48:02] themadfeltcher: Oh I forgot you need to kill level 24-27 mobs to get lavaburst rune... nvm >.<
[4:48:04] itstommy22: I really hope they add a good enh rune next phase. otherwise im worried its gonna be useless
[4:48:05] JohnDeeer: lava las**

[4:49:08] themadfeltcher: Can finally unmute xar... What's his strat that's making ppl mad
[4:49:13] shuyinko123: Water shield + Way of the eart - dual wield specialization
[4:49:14] JohnDeeer: shaman dmg is from autoattack @TheMightis
[4:49:18] SilkeySmooth: you need a mage or a warlock to get the molten blast rune you  need fire damage
[4:49:20] TheMightis: The shield rune doesn't actually proc often, you will see
[4:49:20] gorfang: More mobs blocked = more armor stacks + mana

[4:49:38] blazzedzz: I lvled my shaman shield spec it's great you can pull 2 or 3 mobs with decent gear
[4:49:48] evrgamerr: na - just theorycrafting. not mad per se
[4:50:05] TheMightis: No mana = no healing....
[4:50:22] themadfeltcher: It's a bit hard with shitty gear though
[4:50:27] ezentricks: more mobs=more blocks=profit
[4:50:29] TuckFelstra_: can you please link the spellbook addon you have. that shows what you have to learn when you level up?
[4:50:30] kaizen421: its very strong i run shield spec on my sham, dagger is BIS
[4:50:30] Asmii: kill time with dual wield means you take even less damage than using shield
[4:50:35] SilkeySmooth: you need fire damage for the molten blast rune
[4:50:37] gorfang: Shield rune procs often on small aoe pulls
[4:50:37] aagoltz94: @SilkeySmooth you dont need a mage or warlock for molten blast...
[4:50:39] teobobbyolsen: gonna use woldbuff for rfc?

[4:50:59] Phoenix3215: Yup
[4:50:59] yami_yugi_87: quick dagger is BIS
[4:51:00] Ophelly: you should learn molten blast as lava lash with a shield is useless
[4:51:00] themadfeltcher: If you get that mlten dagger from SFK it's GG
[4:51:01] mith124: another 10 silver
[4:51:01] adam_brisbane: do you have the silver?
[4:51:01] neev888: and water shield is excellent while leveling
[4:51:01] Asmii: daggers is UC
[4:51:02] onlypyros: Dagger Org
[4:51:04] fmxhc: lava lash costs almost 0 mana. its more mana efficient than shield spec and spamming shocks

[4:51:16] themadfeltcher: Dagger off last boss in SFK so good as shaman
[4:51:19] niall_9: shield rune + multiple mobs + molten blast is BIS for low level dungeons

[4:51:27] TheMightis: Lava Lash is 5 mana

[4:51:29] NotoriousTWIG: Molten blast is expensiveish
[4:51:29] ruttoluikero: MB expensive mana
[4:51:30] fmxhc: molten blasts costs alot
[4:51:31] Asmii: molten blast is a ton on mana because its high aoe threat
[4:51:32] S_Belwas: no it costs a good bit
[4:51:33] TheMightis: Molten Vlast is 90 mana
[4:51:35] Doaxfury: @Xaryu I main shaman tank. Shield block will not be good for you. You need to fight 3+ mobs for it to give much
[4:51:35] ezeebzee: it's expensive Sadge
[4:51:36] S_Belwas: its like a shock
[4:51:38] fmxhc: lava lash is like 4 mana
[4:51:39] TheKraken2024: Molten Blast is 43 mana
[4:51:40] evrgamerr: 18% omg
[4:51:45] themadfeltcher: Molten blast more expensive for sure, you need water shield or shield procs to spam
[4:51:45] NotoriousTWIG: MB is only for tanking multiple mobs
[4:51:46] gorfang: Shield spec loses value in 1v1 situations
[4:51:48] steinis2k: @Xaryu just wait till you get shaman rage homie, holy moly that's a lot of mana regen on a 1 min cd
[4:51:48] Ociroza: xarNerdge
[4:51:56] actionmanpvp: actionmanpvp subscribed with Prime. 
[4:52:00] The_Crane: Molten aoe though. It hits everyone in front of you
[4:52:02] niall_9: you’ll regain mana - Molten blast is good for rfc
[4:52:06] alejandro7com: Looks like Xarmon's leg day is paying off! Those trunks are impressive!
[4:52:06] TheMightis: Molten Blast will make you oom, especially in a 1v1
[4:52:07] Zonex2004: Any ways to increase block chance?
[4:52:07] JohnDeeer: you only spam earth shock actually
[4:52:08] SilkeySmooth: most shamans dual wield tank in bfd anyway
[4:52:13] blazzedzz: It's still better
[4:52:14] FelaFelz: daggers is in UC
[4:52:15] cannlbal: @Xaryu water shield on hands

[4:52:18] Puppytime: youll get it back fast with multiple mobs on you
[4:52:19] aagoltz94: @Xaryu  get the molten blast rune from muglore, its EZ, the durotar one requires a mage/lock
[4:52:24] S_Belwas: falst
[4:52:24] rokford_: dagger also in org
[4:52:24] NotoriousTWIG: @Xaryu tl;dr shield is the move for everything up to BFD
[4:52:26] themadfeltcher: for sure, HC tanking you want shield
[4:52:30] TheMightis: I DW tank in BFD
[4:52:31] Doaxfury: mana shield
[4:52:31] smol_monkey_man: water shield
[4:52:33] Codratz: water shield
[4:52:33] JohnDeeer: yup
[4:52:37] Astralthundr: water shield
[4:52:39] Blinder_th: those shamans are paper tanks
[4:52:41] crvyxn: lava lash or water shield
[4:52:43] themadfeltcher: Dual weild tank probably has tanky weap though, that armour one from BFD
[4:52:43] ruttoluikero: To play efficiently with MB and shield specialization, you want to keep pulling 3-5 mobs, you'll pretty much have infinite mana, but it does require healer so only really efficient in dungeons. With decent gear and good healer, you can pull entire 10-20 mobs ez
[4:52:45] dennadell: what does BFD stand for?
[4:52:47] SilkeySmooth: double rock biter
[4:52:51] RjCrit: I swap depending on boss
[4:52:52] monsiuuuu: @Blinder_th dk about that
[4:52:52] mfrancis1972: I got out of bedto watch you
[4:52:52] NotoriousTWIG: Water shield you can get right now
[4:52:52] Roland_NA: lava lash > water shield for DW, imo
[4:52:54] darkom31: water shield is kolkar chest right?
[4:52:57] S_Belwas: i always see shaman tanks with shields for the melee bosses
[4:53:00] Spiritjoo: Lol. You can't DW tank against Akumai
[4:53:02] darkside_otm: molten blast for trash. lava lash for short boss fights. water shield for long boss fights
[4:53:04] Evil_WoW_ttv: dual wield tank once good gear. before that play shield.
[4:53:05] Astralthundr: guys, water shield requires lvl 20
[4:53:10] NotoriousTWIG: @Spiritjoo I literally did 3 days ago
[4:53:11] Astralthundr: he cannot get it right now
[4:53:11] JuggaBugga: tater did it in shield spec
[4:53:17] playerpersonx: @dennadell begging for dick
[4:53:18] RjCrit: I DW tank the whole raid
[4:53:18] niall_9: don’t listen to chat. DW shamans have gear. I MT as a shaman too and nothing beats molten blast + shield rune in low level dungeons
[4:53:18] gunzpewpew: @ruttoluikero Had an enhancement shaman tank SFK in like 5 or 6 pulls
[4:53:19] nat3423: @Roland_NA ideally but unless you're killing fast you want water shield for mana
[4:53:20] spunkfilleddowny: ye
[4:53:22] breezegodd: yes
[4:53:23] JohnDeeer: shield add lots of sustain the dual wield tank shaman is good in questing for BFD it's not tufnuf
[4:53:24] cannlbal: yes
[4:53:25] spunkfilleddowny: butcher is nice
[4:53:25] The_Crane: Yes
[4:53:27] evrgamerr: Ya drop

[4:53:30] BrianAffair: yes
[4:53:31] DominikDB: GET IT
[4:53:32] theoriginalseth: yeah
[4:53:36] themadfeltcher: axes, daggers and maces are bread and butter
[4:53:40] theoriginalseth: maces and axes seem to be most common
[4:53:41] gorfang: Also this is Hardcore so defo shield over dual wield tanking
[4:53:44] Saltyzanta: RFC today?
[4:53:45] Roland_NA: @nat3423 oh i guess i was only in groups that would kill fast, that's a good point
[4:53:54] Zonex2004: Are you doing anything special for RFC?
[4:54:03] alejandro7com: **"Looks like we're all about that shield life today! Can't have too much protection, right?"**
[4:54:10] ruttoluikero: @gunzpewpew Yeah, I do the same. First pull basically to rethilgore, second the entire courtyard, then the dining hall, etc.. very fun :D
[4:54:11] joeChingon: you can dual wield tank in bfd
[4:54:16] notjohndoe: notjohndoe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 1 month streak! What up daddy

[4:54:23] themadfeltcher: you CAN dual wield tank, but shouldn't while HC
[4:54:23] Nimfo: is thier an addon to join dungeons easier?
[4:54:27] Zonex2004: Noice
[4:54:34] Treehop: I think retail might be having issues.  I can't inspect or choose any of my vault items.  At first it was acting like I didn't even have any items.
[4:54:37] voltrox1909: 2 agi/spirit/stam legs tho
[4:54:39] ruttoluikero: Silence and intense mana drain will be. your only weaknesses as tank shaman
[4:54:40] handovdoom666: is sharing quests allowed?
[4:54:41] JuggaBugga: also, he isnt going to have best items or full BIS for BFD
[4:54:46] zerozuckerl: rfc planned for today chat? just tuned in
[4:54:50] kaizen421: @Nimfo nope you actually have to talk to people
[4:54:51] voltrox1909: shit my b
[4:54:59] themadfeltcher: check leather vendors tho?
[4:55:02] adam_brisbane: Can we gamble if the DPS will reach double digits?
[4:55:04] strezzedtv: no quest loot?
[4:55:07] hazuki_15: Thats dumb
[4:55:08] OinkNico: !sodcore
[4:55:08] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[4:55:14] themadfeltcher: can buy greens
[4:55:16] stewpottt: how geared as a lock do i have to be for bfd
[4:55:18] themadfeltcher: otru
[4:55:30] Zonex2004: More glory
[4:55:30] nich0w_: o7
[4:55:31] themadfeltcher: Just buy gold from gold farmers
[4:55:31] TheMightis: I forgot he can't use quest loot. Might be best to go for a tanking set up then. Killing mobs will take longer, but he will survive
[4:55:43] gorfang: FOR GLORY!
[4:55:50] evrgamerr: Enchant are difficult - could you see leveling enchanting just to drop it for eeg
[4:56:14] Phoenix3215: @xaryu RFC mobs will resist you a lot, my 18 shaman got resisted over and over
[4:56:19] yami_yugi_87: excuse my french but dont you think its bullshit how quick shaman buffs run out?
[4:56:22] REGEL7: for ench you also need bs for the rod
[4:56:27] Zonex2004: Is it just me or does DW not miss that much
[4:56:30] gorfang: Dual wield levels real fast tho
[4:56:37] spunkfilleddowny: its gonna hurt
[4:56:38] themadfeltcher: Those rock boys are immune to nature
[4:56:39] zerozuckerl: @yami_yugi_87 real bad french bro
[4:56:43] niall_9: DW messes a ton without rune
[4:56:46] PiffRock_TV: @Xaryu my guy you think living bomb paired with fingers of frost + shatter +imp blizz is gonna be a vibe for aoe leveling
[4:56:49] BrianAffair: you got this xar
[4:56:59] ChumpsMcGee: @evrgamerr he would have to level bs to get the rods, then level something to get the greens, then level enchanting
[4:57:03] sttvit: @Xaryu Hey :) How to get buff you showed (120min) that give 20% movement?
[4:57:10] Zonex2004: You should try it solo, and try it with 2v1. Shield mana makes a diff
[4:57:12] Roland_NA: you def need the DW specialization rune if you wanna tank, the extra hit is really nice
[4:57:21] yami_yugi_87: @zerozuckerl not your bro, must have me mistaken with someone else
[4:57:29] niall_9: you gotta pull multiple mobs with shield and molten blast then for DPS. you won’t be pulling 1 mob in rfc
[4:57:32] evrgamerr: @ChumpsMcGee True about the rods
[4:57:33] nich0w_: @sttvit For alliance hang out in Darnassus and Horde hang out in Mulgore, it triggers when someone turns in a raid quest
[4:57:34] PiffRock_TV: i feel like we didnt need regen rune in classic so it might be giga cracked
[4:57:35] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu Buy new water before rfc
[4:57:37] purdueghost: @BrianAffair
[4:57:37] gorfang: No way
[4:57:38] kazuHots: dont do that
[4:57:39] Zonex2004: Nono, the dps checks
[4:57:40] zerozuckerl: @sttvit wait in TB (horde) or Darnassus (alliance) until someone hands in the quest and the buff goes out
[4:57:40] ethereum1030: Sure.
[4:57:43] themadfeltcher: nah no way
[4:57:43] TheMightis: no
[4:57:43] s0ftboiled: @ChumpsMcGee cant mine aswell, so only ore from chests
[4:57:43] asloff: guzu did it
[4:57:43] gorfang: Take a priest
[4:57:45] Seoken1: lol no shot
[4:57:45] themadfeltcher: you'd go oom
[4:57:50] NotoriousTWIG: Wait, so to get the Goblin runes a SoDcore player would need to level engineering, leatherworking and mining manually?
[4:57:52] scuba9414: death cave
[4:57:54] Ilove_togetwet: thought you were a glory guy... guess we were wrong
[4:57:55] adam_brisbane: if you were a hunter you could but not as a shaman
[4:57:56] TheMightis: Be careful in this cave, the spawns suck
[4:57:56] rottenapplez89: Do it
[4:57:57] tobra: btw earth shock doesnt need to be the killingblow

[5:01:38] playerpersonx: @stache007 flurry is just 10% atk speed at 25. str and flat ap is still better at this level
[5:01:38] themadfeltcher: DPS lower overall, but better survive and aoe damage
[5:01:44] AlphaaGames: big pull
[5:01:44] Xfro4555: lighning shield + molten blast is best dps / mana effisciant

[5:03:00] alpacabowldood: lol
[5:03:01] macnswiss: he was lvl12 I think

[5:03:07] BrianAffair: easy 2 man rfc
[5:03:08] themadfeltcher: tank shammy is fun

[5:03:14] fellifell: he was lvl 12 without those tank runes
[5:03:18] SghettiBoy: Rav getting one upped by a troll in undies
[5:03:24] evrgamerr: Underhanded jab at Rav?  ;)
[5:03:25] themadfeltcher: when you get mobs that don't trigger block it starts to suck
[5:03:27] mikkelssen: i like that you are going full tarzan
[5:03:28] SilkeySmooth: you can get water shield now
[5:03:29] winningfob: use a dagger when you get one
[5:03:30] rollinsthechamp: https://clips.twitch.tv/ConcernedBoxyJayHotPokket-d-NvO6YRsOodFyYU
[5:03:34] 1shabbymn: you do have a trash weapon
[5:03:36] kirk_hunts: did you watch more barny at beginning of the stream?
[5:03:38] TrueZeldaFan: dps is 0 when dead so lookin good
[5:03:39] Blinder_th: same with all tank specs though if your going tank aoe farm
[5:03:41] Jake96: i struggle with warlock
[5:03:41] Flecked: bro did you watch new rav video
[5:03:45] gorfang: Shield blocks stack armor too
[5:03:46] thefallen_904: ya slightly less dps but way safer
[5:04:00] The_Crane: Shield 100% the move for HC
[5:04:01] jamesblunt420x: if not on hardcore you just fight 4 mobs at the time with this build while level to get max targets from MB
[5:04:16] MonkeyOverlord: The thing is, you don't take on one mob with this build. Always  aim for 2. Increases the blocks that maintains mana. If you have to take one mob you may as well just drink
[5:04:19] alejandro7com: Wow, this streamer is amazing! I hope he wins the game! 🙌
[5:04:19] kazuHots: dont forget the armor staack for every shield block
[5:04:21] borstick: !addon
[5:04:22] StreamElements: Find Xaryu's addons & macros in discord -> discord.gg/xaryu in the #addons-macros channel
[5:04:23] themadfeltcher: casters suck for it though
[5:04:25] evrgamerr: That last Rav vid, was great - especially the Deadmines run
[5:04:26] SilkeySmooth: water shield next its in a chest in the barrens @Xaryu
[5:04:33] bburton02: It’s busted once you get gear too.
[5:04:34] handyshotz: go steal more mobs so you can get more greens
[5:04:34] Zonex2004: Is blacksmith worth it for weapons?
[5:04:35] kirk_hunts: Hey guys did he watch episode 2 of Barny during reacts? I got home late
[5:04:38] TheShazamMan: more mana
[5:04:39] DylanP3: Jesus you just dont take damage
[5:04:41] priestialityg: Morning, what's the latest challenge?
[5:04:47] themadfeltcher: Techncially it gets easier with more mobs, you get more blocks, more mana back, and the stacks increase your armour so you take less damage
[5:04:55] Clingodr: Xar have you ever played POE?
[5:04:59] Blinder_th: Mb only hits 4 mobs though so best to keep it max 4
[5:04:59] Tbiz87: that red shirt tho
[5:04:59] wikzek: More armor from shield mastery
[5:05:14] 1shabbymn: imagine if your weapon wasn't trash
[5:05:52] 1shabbymn: the stuff that ran out
[5:05:58] nicktamere666: totems?
[5:06:05] Tbiz87: def totems
[5:06:05] Beggebin: o7 Kappa
[5:06:10] Maroxus: Hello Xar <3
[5:06:11] snygglejf: what happend to big boi dualwield?
[5:06:12] s0ftboiled: you toook his aggro when you attacked the other mob
[5:06:13] bburton02: Troll are underrated af. Guy is looking stacked.
[5:06:13] 1shabbymn: they were in combat with that guy's totem and you attacked one of the m
[5:06:21] whaka86: I have noticed that even in Pvp you use % for hp on mobs. I dont know how you do it. If I cant see the hp in numbers instead of % it scares me in hardcore.
[5:06:30] evrgamerr: This class is interesting, you have all the experience with your Barbarian and Casting / efficiency with Frost Mage - Is this build a combination of the two?
[5:06:31] borstick: Which gathermate addon is that?
[5:06:52] Zonex2004: Is Earth Shock the best interrupt in the game?
[5:07:08] Quabbe: its the worst
[5:07:09] bestop1: yo
[5:07:09] AngerManagmt: what are you going to lvl for p2?
[5:07:16] ruttoluikero: Earth shock is good, but its not best
[5:07:18] Fargom: ES rank 1 is the best spell in the game :P 25 mana
[5:07:22] bburton02: Kick
[5:07:44] CharlieLad7359: xar is this eu or just another character bcz why not?
[5:07:57] NotoriousTWIG: Losing the range on ES due to WoE feels bad, but it's insane to have it on it's own CD away from Fire/Frost
[5:07:58] Pixiepantss: sheesh how long have you been in there
[5:08:01] alejandro7com: Maybe the real endgame boss is finding a shirt that matches Xar's red shirt level. Fashion upgrade needed!
[5:08:01] Daphud: This cave pre-10 as a Hunter is the worst
[5:08:02] rollinsthechamp: @CharlieLad7359 2nd sodcore char
[5:08:03] Galaxy_ape: is alchemy good for a mage?
[5:08:20] CharlieLad7359: ty ^^
[5:08:24] ruttoluikero: Maybe pvp bis, if you can get in range to use it, you cnan hit some big crits at 60 with it and basically you can global casters with 2h windfury proc + ES
[5:08:32] philsbad2: @Xaryu when do you plan to go back to retail pvp?
[5:08:47] Woah_Zerk: Those bracers gotta be BiS til naxx
[5:08:53] themadfeltcher: IT's a little RNG though. If you get rng block screwed you end up oom with way less armour
[5:09:00] shloom995: will you play with onlyfangs again? @Xaryu
[5:09:21] BrianAffair: so hyped for rfc we need them greens
[5:09:34] hersftw: the shaman is slaaaping

[5:09:54] The_Crane: RFC has sooo many greens
[5:09:54] Flecked: onlyfangs is rip, i bet only pops is online
[5:09:57] coolcoolcool777dood: i have 25k gold on skull rock hc lol
[5:10:02] JuggaBugga: this style seems a bit more fun to pla than DW lol
[5:10:08] bigwilly3737: pops is the only one playing hes 57 almost 58
[5:10:12] benarchambaultm: Keep the 5 stacks it's insane
[5:10:16] themadfeltcher: damn, should have releveld my priest
[5:10:16] rollinsthechamp: Munchys? 13 Priest @Xaryu
[5:10:21] taylorsdank: i have a lvl 15 mage on sodcore
[5:10:22] sarrgasso: that mana return for blocking is very good
[5:10:28] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu Nah not me
[5:10:29] EVGENIY_GENNADIY: Hey ya there @Xaryu! are u gonna play SoD official? And do you know format of this? is it new server or we will be able to play with other ppl on HC servers?
[5:10:31] rollinsthechamp: Just saw him
[5:10:47] Zonex2004: Objectively speaking, could Guzu have dispelled better/differently for Dabuvix?
[5:10:54] alejandro7com: @Flecked only pops is online and he's playing with his popsicles Kappa
[5:10:58] RayLawn: I’ll create one tonight and I can run with you tomorrow night
[5:11:04] HEXEDstream: I had to step out for a bit. Were we able to try the dual wielding? The shield feels better?
[5:11:05] dreamreamer: Is the SODA HC RAIDS done?
[5:11:10] dreamreamer: are***

[5:11:53] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu Get a hunter then and heal yourself if needed

[5:12:16] Zonex2004: Is mage healing strong enough by 13?
[5:12:17] baileyyalexx: I think you’d be fine with a mage
[5:12:17] evrgamerr: Its how you learn - you guys learned by sardaco's wipe.. the use of hunter pets tanking was brilliant - great run
[5:12:19] baileyyalexx: kite it out
[5:12:23] jeussi: what are u trying to solo
[5:12:26] S_Belwas: it doesn't do anything on the magic damage though and you are going to be eating shadow bolts
[5:12:26] RELAXPLX: @EVGENIY_GENNADIY blizz never announced an official HC sod, so you'll have to wait and see
[5:12:29] BoogerWizard: lavalash best server
[5:12:31] ttvtracerg: WISH I WAS HOME
[5:12:34] Libertas09: @S_Belwas yooo
[5:12:35] themadfeltcher: nah no shot solo, at 25 my decked shaman can only just solo parts of WC
[5:12:36] chaarcole: does it HAVE to be a priest?
[5:12:38] HEXEDstream: 3 Shaman? maybe Shaman 2 Druid?
[5:12:39] rejlly: penance and homunculi would make it so easy
[5:12:39] thebigdongerhere: Isnt lavalash for gayche ppl ?

[5:37:38] DabRigg: Caster
[5:37:45] Vio9: stoneskin is worth, idk about searing if it's not a boss
[5:37:46] NotoriousTWIG: @MrPapadorgio When you get RB back up you get the max health back, but you've still lost 30% hp- it doesn't fill up so you need to be healed
[5:37:47] alejandro7com: Looks like the chat is on fire today! So many predictions and bug discussions. Twitch chat never disappoints!

[5:38:05] themadfeltcher: Also remember you can rank 1 earth shock to interrupt and save mana
[5:38:09] evrgamerr: Retail has such a different feel, almost two separate games
[5:38:11] catjammespam: gotta get geat before i can play retail LUL
[5:38:12] MEDICx87: wrong way
[5:38:13] Fargom: At this level i bet stoneskin is preventing like 20% dmg / swing, it's big at low levels

[5:45:11] Woah_Zerk: get the mana, then swap back
[5:45:13] gowestin: dont think it replaces way of the earth
[5:45:13] NotoriousTWIG: @Xaryu Shaman rage is kept on a second pair of pants for you to use instead of drinking between pulls
[5:45:13] Zonex2004: Huge
[5:45:17] yellowgaiden: oh damn ur gunna flip when u get it

[5:45:37] S_Belwas: even the casters use way of the earth when leveling beacuse you get way more health and dam reductions and you get shocks on separate cooldowns

[5:47:38] themadfeltcher: Dope
[5:47:39] gorfang: Spunk
[5:47:39] lampsterof79: Maybe no new runes, just a filler expamsion
[5:47:42] ruttoluikero: Spell power totem, improved Clearcasting, improved elemental mastery are few things I could see shamans getting in future
[5:47:46] thericebags: lvl 22 with 2 runes is the struggle bruh
[5:47:53] themadfeltcher: Cause it's hard to replace any of the key shaman tank runes so would suck if none of the new ones were used
[5:47:57] yakmersh: is it Feb8th yet??
[5:47:57] hawks15233: there was a leak that should belt runes on rogues before sod released so there will be more slots

[5:48:21] KonQel: if Rav went warr tank he die on turtle
[5:48:25] SghettiBoy: I hope they dont do too many more slots, it kinda defeats the purpose a little, like i enjoy the fun of situationally adjusting my characters abilities

If player activity is very low or very high, the percentage progress will be sped up or slowed down to match those time constraints.

[6:47:11] kirk_hunts: Now the event will only start 2 hours after the previous event. This now leaves the percentage for each faction completely pointless.. why not just add a 2 hour timer in place of percentages, or have the event start every 2 hours on the hour.
