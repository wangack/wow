[0:34:34] zachgamegodx: if this bug happens

[0:38:46] MaybeRespect: Or maybe i'm crazy but I don't mind root stopping verdant. Kinda like disarm stops DS
[0:39:07] Lathrien: demo lock kick is 1 min
[0:39:18] VitoBambino: correct, only other one (which is really a blanket silence) is beam

[0:43:05] JustSneepy: dispel protection+ only 20sec
[0:43:27] JustSneepy: everydispel maybe silence enemy?
[0:43:45] brizz3: What if it worked like UA where if it's dispelled you get silenced
[0:43:47] vibesham: But also shroud isnt needed as much if step 1 is made
[0:44:18] JustSneepy: What about dreamwalker embrace? is it worth it?
[0:44:26] brizz3: Lol didn't ready that before I typed sneepy
[0:44:30] brizz3: Read
[0:45:08] MaybeRespect: Some of these changes would 100% make pres OP

[0:45:24] Rentun: dewRag dewRag dewRag dewRag
[0:46:17] crypkin: how do you think caster MW is rn? i know fist is lowkey kinda nutty but caster feels rough in 3s
[0:46:28] MaybeRespect: Unburdened + silence/cc immune during scales is so annoying as melee
[0:46:31] VitoBambino: what if evokers were immune to poly effects like druid in shapeshift?

[0:48:49] 00ZZEE: do you want all of this or is each point sufficient enough to make them "better"?
[0:50:22] ZonnyArk: a pain in PvE = guarantee change Pog
[0:50:22] MaybeRespect: How you feel about the dmg output of Pres? @cdewx
[0:50:35] Onshuffle: I think it would be nice if time dilation had some damage reduction or got rid of some delayed damage
[0:50:54] shredder1111: i want lower gcd echo, feels so clunky atm
[0:51:16] MaybeRespect: Think that's where shroud/hover come in
[0:51:22] shredder1111: more globals for dmg
[0:51:32] biofreaks: Why does it have shorter range? What is wrong with normal healer range for Pres? There must be a reason for that decision.
[0:51:38] MaybeRespect: The slow immune part. Is that not hover?
[0:51:48] laevus11: what about emerald communion getting stopped by clone and dh banish?
[0:51:55] MaybeRespect: Gotcha.

[0:53:57] shredder1111: maybe the commune shouldnt work on the pres but it does on allies when in a clone
[0:54:27] ZonnyArk: was just about to say, rewind needs some love LUL
[0:54:40] Reconr: what if we just make shamans good again and delete evokers?
[0:55:20] Itankarenas: if only they could make pvp specific changes.. oh fucking wait
[0:55:38] ZonnyArk: pvp forgotten, classic
[0:55:54] Reconr: whats the player base pvp vs pve?
[0:56:29] ZonnyArk: sounds about right LUL
[0:56:36] zachgamegodx: dude that was one hell of a speech

[5:09:10] RealXrave: no keybinds only clicks
[5:09:30] bad_manners: @Somanie The blue cheese was really subtle. It was super good.
[5:09:31] knappster15: cdew opens the spellbook and clicks them from there
[5:09:31] popzirl: click only stream
[5:09:35] knappster15: he just edits it out on stream
[5:09:36] abruptdecayO_O: that should be a sub goal, a session only clicking

[5:10:02] DizziestShot: @Pwnalliance but actually he just hides them in the settings
[5:10:09] Pwnalliance: just never seen invisible keybinds

[5:10:22] Somanie: tfw I'm a clicker monkaS keybinds are lowkey really intimidating for me lol
[5:10:22] durolan: he's playing it like a text rpg
[5:10:23] hasbihlla: playing pres on a steering wheel would be lit
[5:10:30] knappster15: @RealXrave I had to do that one time when my bar bugged in arena. didnt have time to reload LUL

[5:13:13] mvqq: Do you have the NoTaint addon
[5:13:16] Zartirian: AWC soon u rdy?
[5:13:38] Thedruidtyler: its omnibar that causes it
[5:13:40] popzirl: omnibar
[5:13:41] Thedruidtyler: @cdewx
[5:13:42] Sleepiihead: its so freaking annoying
[5:13:45] Somanie: @Itankarenas I think the most intimidating part for me is just not knowing what I should put on which key
[5:13:50] jinxedqt: i always have to reload.
[5:13:55] knappster15: it happens way more on healers I swear
[5:14:01] DarkSideArdi: its omnibar 100%
[5:14:03] Drathimos: dream projection is what usually causes it for evoker
[5:14:14] tehWhilson: use these addons to see what exactly it is @cdew bugsack and buggrabber
[5:14:20] Omgdoom: if you change talents in the starting room and you have omnibar you have to reload before game starts
[5:14:23] popzirl: the only addon that literally doesnt let me click something is omnibar besides that its just the error
[5:14:31] DirtyYankee0: you put them wherever you want, every persons binds are different, My kick is on C for every class for example @Somanie
[5:14:38] hahohihu: it happens mostly on classes that change bars. like when you dream proj on dragon, shapeshift on druid, go stealth etc
[5:14:43] hahohihu: or fly as dh
[5:14:48] popzirl: since the update
[5:14:49] TheEyeVII: what if you reload before the game starts, will it happen anyway
[5:14:55] Itankarenas: @Somanie look at where ur hands sit on the keyboard and put your main spells close to that, and less used spells farther away. I have my main spammable skill on F for every class
[5:14:56] knappster15: Why is this a Dragonflight specific thing? I swear this never happened in past expansions
[5:15:03] mvqq: What is the Mage damage breakdown
[5:15:03] hipsterdufus: Are your empowered spells keybound to modifier keys?
[5:15:08] bpressure: who is the rogue?
[5:15:32] 3riix: notaint or notaint2 ? whichone is rthe right one
[5:15:45] mvqq: You guys are stunning Mage before Blink which allows him to have a Displacement ready and also makes Mes waste a Death Grip; just dont do that and just run at Mage and kick Mage on Missiles and Surge
[5:16:01] Zartirian: Dragonflight UI revamp bricked it and added 400 new bugs @knappster15
[5:16:11] dannosaurus: Download bugggrabber
