[3:35:14] Papa_Shot_: @sodapoppin i got a 14day suspension because of people like you, somehow i took tainted gold in a GDKP and its my fault i didnt background check everyone in the raid
[3:35:14] Coriollis: people are pissed cuz Blizzard will solve it with token and u will have WotLK again where people stopped playing
[3:35:14] Tiefss: wrath has tokens now
[3:35:15] Papa_Shot_: fucking dumb
[3:35:16] brake1o1: @Toadin loser
[3:35:16] citruschrome: @sodapoppin In wrath it's insanely out of control, at least 80% of active players buy a lot of gold.
[3:35:17] hotgamermilk: @Mauwii87 they have reddit brain
[3:35:18] Juraviel: now that its not a permaban, I'm tempted to swipe

[3:35:27] MF_DOMSTA: not to this scale thou
[3:35:27] notOlav: its more noticable because of the increase of GDKPs i feel like
[3:35:29] MadMindaugas: thats because there is a new generation of wow players and they are struggling with the veteran players
[3:35:30] balasparkle: nerfed raid now too

[3:35:42] CyberCushion: for 20 years
[3:35:42] InsulinDependent: streamers are probably a reason classic/SOD are as big as they are but the gold shopping is only a result of how popular the game is and how trash glizzard is at policing their game
[3:35:42] Low_Freakuency: you give legitimacy to it though. Most people would have dismissed it as a scam
