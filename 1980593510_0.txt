[0:42:35] julliant: StreamFollower i dont even think that was a bad line, more of the developer's mistake of recording too few lines for combat KEK
[0:42:38] Decimated_exo: @kapputs in the end you will be able to even just copy major actor voice and looks with 0 issues, understandable that major actors will fight it and have resources for it, but most major actors started as background, replaceable actors. So new actors will have no starting point?
[0:42:47] pepegaphrog: Gachi skull humper
[0:42:57] StreamFollower: @julliant It'll fix it because instead of only having like 3 lines that repeat, they could add as many AI VA lines as they want.

[5:02:59] Zbunka: that might be a scuffed statistic, might be that highest death is due to highest pick rate

[5:03:01] yusba: most deaths % of players playing the class or highest number absolute?
[5:03:05] ferroillum: Might be relative the number of players, since hunter seems popular
[5:03:06] Zycte_: so is sing gonna play WoW until he dies or first raid?

[8:44:39] YoMz: I think they just ran for nothing, causing them to lure more instead of just managing the 3... they were killing the ogres in 2 seconds so it wasnt that bad to lure 3
[8:44:44] amila__: Content
[8:44:44] issacar42: @icysystem sure, but the camera is shit in the cave, so it's a risk and you can't kite whatsoever

[8:45:24] Berksgorh: hyper spam cucked you guys really badly too
[8:45:25] YoMz: they delete those ogres pretty fast on proper setup, so those 3 lures wasnt that bad, but they all ran randomly and ended up luring 7 or 8 instead of just handling 3
[8:45:27] AnotherOnePlebeian: fuck it, at least still alive PepeLaf

[9:19:02] Reticent_88: If threat isn't an issue and you just want to kill faster, sure
[9:19:19] S_H_O_D_A_N: lol, just watched the VOD, that priest with the godly heals PepeLaf
[9:19:21] heyitsMart: @heyitsMart hmm not exactly like that. there are ways to manage threat such as letting the pet start hitting first to get a "headstart" and also slowing down your own damage etc. pets also usually have a taunt but I'm not sure if they have it in classic
[9:19:28] 7TheDevil7: o7
[9:19:32] Nekooooooooo: @9d1w there's no time stamp on youtube but it's around -40 mins if u rewind

[9:19:39] Cascinha: so dog is the main character and the hunter is the sidecharacter?
[9:19:40] Reticent_88: Yeah that's one of the nice things about Screech. It's not just damage and atk drop, applying a debuff also generates threat

[13:31:59] S_H_O_D_A_N: @CarlosMarximos some people REALLY wanted the group to play it, so everyone bought the game and sunk a whole lotta time into it only for the hustlers to drop it first PepeLaf
[13:32:02] Reticent_88: Just work on progressions, play an alt, or play other games Shrugeg I don't know why people see that as an issue
[13:32:06] Asklepios_NL: @DrSpookenstein Yeah there were simple addons back then
[13:32:11] Asklepios_NL: DPS and Threat meters
[13:32:26] Asklepios_NL: and the first boss mechanic addons existed I think....
[13:32:29] DrSpookenstein: @crisbylettuce yeah i guess the raids werent complicated enough to really need addons
[13:32:30] itsWEBDatBoy: itsWEBDatBoy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 32 month streak! 
[13:32:34] crisbylettuce: DrSpookenstein, but it also requires you to kinda be good at the game, instead of some random shitter who only relied on addons to essentially tell him hwo to play the game
