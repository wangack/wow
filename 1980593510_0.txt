So new actors will have no starting point?
[0:42:47] pepegaphrog: Gachi skull humper
[0:42:57] StreamFollower: @julliant It'll fix it because instead of only having like 3 lines that repeat, they could add as many AI VA lines as they want.

[9:16:34] heyitsMart: truly red ridge xdd
[9:16:36] Nerfsound: OMEGALUL BLOOD RED
[9:16:37] Berksgorh: its trully red LUL
[9:16:39] amila__: @heyitsMart so you have to level up such that ideally dog always does more damage than you? that sounds strange
[9:16:40] Reticent_88: You could start doing the Deadmines pre-quests in Westfall
[9:16:43] testmz: !lfs
[9:16:44] Bali_d: probably nothing Clueless

[9:17:39] dante_smiles: I dont like wagamama
[9:17:40] Reticent_88: @amila__ Not more damage, just more threat. Growl (pet skill) is threat generation, and Screech (another one) does some threat too
[9:17:49] bozobear: Pog

[9:18:43] warden28: ashenvale got only a couple of low lvl quests i think
[9:18:55] Nekooooooooo: uuh
[9:19:00] bozobear: @amila__ yep
[9:19:02] Reticent_88: If threat isn't an issue and you just want to kill faster, sure
[9:19:19] S_H_O_D_A_N: lol, just watched the VOD, that priest with the godly heals PepeLaf
[9:19:21] heyitsMart: @heyitsMart hmm not exactly like that. there are ways to manage threat such as letting the pet start hitting first to get a "headstart" and also slowing down your own damage etc. pets also usually have a taunt but I'm not sure if they have it in classic
[9:19:28] 7TheDevil7: o7
[9:19:32] Nekooooooooo: @9d1w there's no time stamp on youtube but it's around -40 mins if u rewind

[9:19:38] RybatX: @singsing does it cost anything to revive pet?
[9:19:39] Cascinha: so dog is the main character and the hunter is the sidecharacter?
[9:19:40] Reticent_88: Yeah that's one of the nice things about Screech. It's not just damage and atk drop, applying a debuff also generates threat
[9:19:43] crisbylettuce: RybatX, just mana
[9:19:54] Bali_d: sing was laughing at deaths till someone died next to him Aware

[9:20:18] Reticent_88: You sent him back to attack an Ogre chasing you, so he would've died I imagine

[13:31:59] S_H_O_D_A_N: @CarlosMarximos some people REALLY wanted the group to play it, so everyone bought the game and sunk a whole lotta time into it only for the hustlers to drop it first PepeLaf
[13:32:02] Reticent_88: Just work on progressions, play an alt, or play other games Shrugeg I don't know why people see that as an issue
[13:32:06] Asklepios_NL: @DrSpookenstein Yeah there were simple addons back then
[13:32:11] Asklepios_NL: DPS and Threat meters
[13:32:26] Asklepios_NL: and the first boss mechanic addons existed I think....
[13:32:29] DrSpookenstein: @crisbylettuce yeah i guess the raids werent complicated enough to really need addons
[13:32:30] itsWEBDatBoy: itsWEBDatBoy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 32 month streak! 
[13:32:34] crisbylettuce: DrSpookenstein, but it also requires you to kinda be good at the game, instead of some random shitter who only relied on addons to essentially tell him hwo to play the game
