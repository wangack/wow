[3:55:10] ganklust: Gdkp is the best method of raiding, anyone who disagrees is refusing to critically think
[3:55:19] Indomitablez: @Payo There will just be discord servers with bidding bots so its not done in-game

[3:57:41] xgrumpygrampsx: @hothandzztcg Players pool gold. Majority of players constantly gaining more gold than they ever would farming open world or other methods like professions. then ppl who dont gdkp get fucked having to pay 25g for a 1g consume becuase gdkps inflated everything
[3:57:43] sherekhan75: sometimes it's only your 2nd or 3rd bis yeah
[3:57:46] Dimichsky: dragon kill points is bis
[3:57:49] LipzVoorheez: we use rolling @SR with + 5 everytime you reserve the item without receiving it.
[3:57:51] brakealot: if you dont know your guildies well dkp works okay I think
