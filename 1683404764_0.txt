[2:45:52] AtaQC: Getting stream sniped probably
[2:45:52] 16oct22: This actually might be a result of this game going f2p also, smurfing is easier
[2:45:53] Jamestronik: check their rank history, i was masters at the end of OW1 and hardstuck gold in ow2 (playing with all dia/masters)

[2:46:16] gek_real: its so hard to stream snipe and smurf when its MMR based matchmaking. Its moreso a matter of the matchmaking being atrocious
[2:46:16] PsykeShow: @tpnoodle Shrouds hidden MMR is extremelly high aswell
[2:46:16] wiryninja: Ya hidden matchmaking is just crazy and makes no sense
[2:46:17] iG23flex: @shroud don't shoot doom's block, you'll charge it and it stuns and does more damage because of that

[2:57:02] Oh_its_deez: This is why I said overwatch needs a better matchmaking system. Its either you getting rolled or the other team rolling you. It’s like they have no idea how to determine ones rank
[2:57:09] steel4234: Hello shroud! i just wanted to ask, do you use windows 11 or 10?
[2:57:14] Technicyan: are you allowed to do that in a sponsored stream ? Kapp

[2:57:53] hacksawl: @Oh_its_deez Nah the ranks are pretty accurate, but the matchmaker is too lenient. It'll put people who are like 2 ranks apart in the same game
[2:57:54] Raein91: Pog

[3:14:43] FundamentallyTrash: @shroud Here's your explanation on why ashe feels weird.... This only applies to Ashe... if you shoot immediately after ADSing (a jump shot qualifies) the aiming animation causes a 50ish ms delay in the firing of the bullet.
[3:14:44] temtemlegend: Shroud why are you the goat at every game you touch?
[3:14:45] Joeavatar: @apto_o because you might lose 19 and win 7 for example. so you will derank
[3:14:45] flashnickgg: WOW plebs DESPAIR
[3:14:45] massivewow: @Just_Chicken you just dont get reranked until you win 7 or lose 20 but if you go 7-7 you prolly deranking

[4:27:27] AGirlCalledJim: That's called Paladins
[4:27:28] komota: just make tank another dps LUL
[4:27:31] hamslam95: If they got rid of the 30% ult charge when you switch people wouldnt do it as much

[4:27:49] KrissKlein: that's such a dumb idea
[4:27:49] Daelaron86: it's funny how they said they designed 5v5 to not need to counter that much and now you need to counter even harder LUL
[4:27:50] KT77777: Just play bastion
[4:27:50] JR_Shoegazer: @batounet1 It’s terrible game design
[4:27:50] CanadianBacon41: so ur saying git gud 🤔
[4:27:55] KrissKlein: OMEGALUL
[4:27:57] C1X5H: draft could be interesting yeah
[4:28:03] MaximBubbles: DoritosChip
[4:28:03] PookOut: We need agent band
[4:28:09] bananabanana2222: each hero does something different so you want people to just lose because they picked the wrong hero at the start?
[4:28:09] PookOut: Bans
[4:28:10] dc_met4l: Play doomfist
[4:28:11] de_cpl_milll: THERE IS NOTHING TO PLAY, FUCK @shroud
[4:28:12] Hantossedpotato: my mans is tilted
[4:28:12] alibiceps1: bastion?
[4:28:14] OptionalGames: actually id be down with a draft in ow
[4:28:15] s4yto: game is so unbalanced
[4:28:16] DArK050: i love how ppl ask shroud how he would do stuff differently just because he has more money than them KEKW
[4:28:17] CARNEL1AN_: That would work if they added. ban system before every match for certain characters
[4:28:18] roooyal: They should just buff all hitscan chars
[4:28:19] SKLxZero: like in league of legends with the draft
[4:28:20] PathlessCross: Yeah that’s never happening. Switching character is Overwatch
[4:28:21] crabrizz: bastion ftw
[4:28:26] Munsii: should have to lock character and also swap roles with a teammate in the second round
[4:28:27] de_cpl_milll: holy shit this sucks
[4:28:27] crabrizz: chooo choo
[4:28:27] Daelaron86: draft would be a fun optional mode though
[4:28:30] loveyellabones: who’s the guys he’s playing with ? so i can watch someone not so fuckin negative
[4:28:32] batounet1: you think so? @JR_Shoegazer I like it but it's probably because I played the game for a long time
[4:28:33] Danger_Stin: Go widow and aim check everyone
[4:28:37] Tabneto: just miss less then the enemy
[4:28:40] dizzy_o_o: L ads
[4:28:44] sadaplays: unfortunately counter picking is the way to climb in this game
[4:28:46] kkitsuneyy: @loveyellabones its TenZ
[4:28:46] JayVee96_: Widow Kreygasm
[4:28:49] joelios10: Yeah,  ban 1 tank 2 dps and 2 healers maybe o.0
[4:28:50] EdgarsNezinu: yeah not able to swap would be stupid imagine junker against phara and eqo
[4:28:53] TheBFB: @shroud tell him disabeling private profiles would be a good change in comp
[4:28:57] JR_Shoegazer: @batounet1 I played the game a lot and hated it
[4:29:00] opti_support: ow is hard u need more experience man
[4:29:01] Z3LAY: full of  gold silver player in this chat im master and the no switch idea is bad af ... switch hero is part of the skill in this game...
[4:29:02] bananabanana2222: @sadaplays only if you aren't good
[4:29:09] adlarryy: I think the problem with the 5v5 they set up here is the tank is now strong enough to be almost 2 characters... so it feels about the same.
[4:29:10] PathlessCross: There would be no way to balance junk ray to beat pharaoh
[4:29:13] munted_eve: i felt like overwatch 1 was balanced around reinhardt, he never really had that many changes, now that hes changed in ow2 its lost its linchpin of balance
[4:29:18] adrian20591: Pog
[4:29:18] Hamz_21: @loveyellabones and amouranth
[4:29:21] JR_Shoegazer: @z3lay No one cares

[4:29:27] azeraph: @Daelaron86 the devs never said they did 5v5 so its less counter pick heavy LUL
[4:29:36] KevinMacc: sheesh
[4:29:39] mellowhyp: full of gold silver player in this chat im master and the no switch idea is bad af ... switch hero is part of the skill in this game...
[4:29:39] resertii: if shroud mained widow he would climb so fast
[4:29:40] Styrkenn: @Z3LAY maybe thats why nobody plays this game and they need to sponsor streamers to get some players
[4:29:41] violenthugger: shb
[4:29:46] MCSwagdooodle: if you ban, then its going to be, no sojourn, no widow, no orisa, no kiriko, and no mercy
