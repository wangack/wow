[3:17:08] Deadge_Gartic: BlizzardServers SmokeTime
[3:17:08] churfuu: they dont need a to do a million calculations for procs spells defense etc, just bullets go pew pew if hit you take daamge
[3:17:13] CamGG__: blizz deff has room to improve but if it was really that simple I think they would, ultimately they lose money when this stuff happens
[3:17:28] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix shitty p2w mmo i played called knight online was handling 500-600 people smashing each other just fine 10 years ago om

[3:17:56] aegrotus_hr: GUILD WARS 2

[4:38:24] deervey124: no it doesnt
[4:38:27] BotKobo: It didn't fall off
[4:38:27] ScovieJ: i dunno if blizz put in a mechanic to force raid logging lol
[4:38:29] ImCakeAble: stareCat
[4:38:31] bluescholar1: what if  you need people with blood hitting him on PHASE 1 and then you need a whole other raid with the no-blood-buff you can get for PHASE 2
[4:38:32] StripSniper: Shiza blood Shiza bruised Shiza altar Shiza kite it Shiza dot it Shiza in the arena Shiza out the arena Shiza less ppl Shiza more ppl Shiza no melee
[4:38:35] tummboi: i dont think so you guys are overcooking
[4:38:38] tummboi: Shiza
[4:38:38] tehbeekz: prep 250 blood before u start, every one of you guys :P
[4:38:39] Cjpriest: i dont think the bruised thing is gonna work
[4:38:43] n_hyun_s: kite him to stormwind
[4:38:44] CrawlingOutoftheSpiral: kite him into booty bay and have flight masters kill him
[4:38:48] gambleragain: Blizzard wants us to log off ye.
[4:38:48] Guenhyvar_: i hit harder not sure why
[4:38:54] Guenhyvar_: all my spells were over 2x
[4:38:56] 209tomcat: you were hitting 1.2k crits dawg
[4:38:56] phopheter: docArrive  ?
[4:38:57] Cjpriest: by the time i got to 10 bruised hbe was already at 20% its so hard to tell
[4:38:58] BotKobo: all my arcane blast hit for over 1k
[4:39:03] 209tomcat: on exorcism
[4:39:10] LyteGod: we haven't tried arena with groups of 5, we only tried with raid savixHmm
[4:39:13] ImCakeAble: Yes
[4:39:15] thebarron00: why is nobody logging this instead of just feelycrafting everything
[4:39:15] StripSniper: the arena docArrive
[4:39:18] FromMountainToSea: did anybody get anything from the boss?
[4:39:21] StealthyNakroth: I really don't think he's intended to be killed lol
[4:39:25] therealAzuth: boss chase's down raids tho, spawns where the ppl are
[4:39:25] Whale445657: I think its related to the altar instead of the arena
[4:39:29] CrawlingOutoftheSpiral: people kite dragons into stormwind for fun
[4:39:32] DangerousMusabi: Overcooking 100%, arena is a good spawn because it's easier to fight it there.
[4:39:33] Cryptoji_Jojoji: It's the blood turn ins COPIUM It's the arena COPIUM It's the bruise stacks COPIUM It's the 5g towers COPIUM  Birds aren't real COPIUM
[4:39:34] CrawlingOutoftheSpiral: they expect people to kite him
[4:39:38] cauldersmokes: this isnt really "doable" for normal people
[4:39:39] Rogueone46: @savix, did u guys try to kite to all the altars?
[4:39:40] ImCakeAble: It is not doable already RAGEY
[4:39:46] jonquiereconnor: Did it die
[4:39:46] zachai313: he was taking dumbledore damage - xaryu
[4:39:48] fuzzywuzzyqt: @Savix there's a reason a GM kited him to an alter
[4:39:51] BotKobo: Savix logout keep the bruise stacks aaaa
[4:39:55] ashtaroxx: plink how is your dmg at the beginning?
[4:39:58] fallendarkone220: honestly like 95% this mob was never meant to be killed and does not have any drop at all - now blizz have to just cook out of nothing
[4:40:03] PineappleDuh: just check the vod for dmg increase
[4:40:04] jonquiereconnor: Judging by your face I assume not
[4:40:04] uglymum: no way bruised does anything
[4:40:09] Cjpriest: the start was fine it was at like 35% that fucked things
[4:40:11] MochiMurloc: ohCry so many inanimate objects and a person's dog were lagging
[4:40:15] StripSniper: Yea its gotta be doable in normal grps
[4:40:25] Eleith: who is funding all the repair bills kekw
[4:40:25] smolindycompany: @savix Occam's Razor:  the simplest solution is often the correct one - this boss isn't killable.
[4:40:26] fuzzywuzzyqt: @Savix there's a reason a GM kited him to an alter 󠀀
[4:40:27] theblupps: @Savix  Bruised - Apply Aura: Dummy Value: 101 PVP Multiplier: 1 Server-side script

[4:40:39] Cjpriest: bruised does not change anything i dont think.
[4:40:39] yaeruwu: Did i miss the second blood ?
[4:40:40] Moonrake: Blizz Devs are laughing so hard at all this right now
[4:40:42] ScovieJ: again, not a plan devs would ever come up with for the game
[4:40:42] Torsoto: giga cope mode
[4:40:44] MochiMurloc: @ImCakeAble ohCry not the animals

[4:41:31] Deadge_Gartic: @BotKobo he has no stacks aaaa
[4:41:35] eastbeast01: nice event i made 5000 coins

[4:41:37] MochiMurloc: @ImCakeAble I'd be no better than polar ohCry I want Savix and others to succeed
[4:41:38] BotKobo: @Deadge_Gartic he has 15 aaaa
[4:41:44] realmalfurionsr: when did he grow?
[4:41:50] toosmoothxo: blizzard will not say anything
[4:41:54] flop: that looks normal no?
[4:41:58] ashtaroxx: plink giga pumpers fr fr
[4:42:01] flop: is that more than usual
[4:42:01] Cjpriest: if blizzard wanted people to kill it theyd lower his health or figure out how to make the servers not actual trash lol
[4:42:02] mookerBL: i was just in STV another layer and had no issues
[4:42:03] ImCakeAble: @MochiMurloc We will protect the animals ohCry
[4:42:04] misomander: nah ret is insane thats natty dam
[4:42:10] MochiMurloc: @ImCakeAble yesh ohCry
[4:42:15] zachai313: zachai313 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:42:15] Deadge_Gartic: @Cjpriest servers are trash for 20 years LULW
[4:42:17] falkorUzumaki: he has a point.. GMs were involved so they could have told you to stop instead
[4:42:18] Fludens: Madge Phil Spencer MS
[4:42:24] Torsoto: its just about the dmg i dont think there is a special start
[4:42:25] Fludens: the arena worked so much better
[4:42:30] criblica: criblica subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! You need to figure out 2 things, if he is intended to be killed. and figure out how to kill him. because now you are just brute forcing him down, and its clearly not intended.
[4:42:30] Nuallan94: fuck waiting for tomorrow
[4:42:31] tummboi: huh
[4:42:33] Spikeqc: AYOO  󠀀
[4:42:33] misomander: FlushedCat n-n-naked?
[4:42:33] zachai313: THANKS FOR THE GREAT STREAM SAV - love yall doing wacky/crazy stuff like this
[4:42:34] MochiMurloc: huh
[4:42:40] BotKobo: @Savix logout to keep your stacks man aaaa
[4:42:40] Moonrake: I think the point of this boss, that Blizzard has state when they talked about him, is to DISCOURAGE giant raids like you were seeing in Ashenvale.
[4:42:42] StripSniper: @Savix you should have logged the event day 1 to see what buffs/debuffs and how is your damage fluctuating
[4:42:42] Tehghost66512: im not sure if damage was scaling with bruised, it was hard to tell with the lag. i just noticed at 20% boss hp i was doing about double damage
[4:42:43] Deadge_Gartic: if blizzard doesnt like what you doing you would be at least warned by now
[4:42:46] Cjpriest: @Deadge_Gartic yeah so obviously the path forward is they need to either lower his health or reach out and give a tip
[4:42:47] Moonrake: I don't think he's going to die
[4:42:48] LILSyuto: This is like echo mythic prog same duration pause aswell
[4:42:49] zachai313: BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD LOA
[4:42:57] ImCakeAble: Mute Xaryu and boss dies 100% RAGEY
[4:42:59] Deadge_Gartic: @Cjpriest a gm was here yesterday
[4:43:06] realmalfurionsr: yep
[4:43:10] 209tomcat: savix you are right
[4:43:12] Spikeqc: AYOO
[4:43:13] Agmaran: check size change while turning in
[4:43:14] gambleragain: Might be berserk troll thing.
[4:43:15] gormzo: everyone know that, the question is so what to do
[4:43:15] ImCakeAble: Yes you kill him in the arena @Savix
[4:43:19] Cjpriest: @Deadge_Gartic yes i know
[4:43:21] Cryptoji_Jojoji: I thought it was like Mandokir that he gets bigger as he gets more kills
[4:43:24] BIuffwatcher: I think you need to fed a BLOOD god blood.
[4:43:25] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix outside of size this seems like just regular enrage mechanic when its 20%. he took double damage , stacks didnt increase the amount
[4:43:27] sensei6: monkaW
[4:43:29] realmalfurionsr: was it related to his kill count?
[4:43:30] ChiefMango: @Savix normally he doesn't get bigger when you turn in. but maybe at 20% he gets bigger from turnins
[4:43:32] Moonrake: Wasn't it his Ear Stacks buff that increased his size?
[4:43:33] DangerousMusabi: Blizz could just nerf boss so everyone gets kill and quits like ez
[4:43:34] gambleragain: Might be a 20% thing, troll.
[4:43:35] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix outside of size this seems like just regular enrage mechanic when its 20%. he took double damage , stacks didnt increase the amount 󠀀
[4:43:35] StripSniper: It was in arena before, and it didn't get bigger then
[4:43:37] AMLoogi: doesnt he just get bigger when hes 20%
[4:43:39] ImCakeAble: @Savix I seen him grow bigger before and it was also in the arena
[4:43:45] tacoking011: @AMLoogi Not that big
[4:43:47] epilepticunicorn_: this all honestly sounds like a lot of cope
[4:43:48] criblica: Makes so much sense to go give blood. he is saying "give me blood" you are giving your offerings to this guy
[4:43:49] Cjpriest: it doesnt i dont think
[4:43:50] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix outside of size this seems like just regular enrage mechanic when its 20%. he took double damage , stacks didnt increase the amount
[4:43:52] Rogueone46: I dont think it does
[4:43:57] StripSniper: Maybe you need to stack bruised
[4:43:59] Cjpriest: i really dont think bruised changes anything
[4:43:59] BIuffwatcher: @AMLoogi he wasnt that big last few times I dont think
[4:44:00] lecharles84: nah the bruised theory doesnt seems to make sense to me
[4:44:01] onikudaki1871: Turning in made him bigger and take more damage maybe?
[4:44:01] bendalf__: Maybe it gets bigger when you pull on it COCKA
[4:44:02] GioBrothers: does he get damage when he is killing?
[4:44:03] ashtaroxx: ICANT
[4:44:06] tummboi: om
[4:44:06] falkorUzumaki: @savix.. check when he stops emoting asking for blood

[4:50:34] kickflipy: @Savix What if when he targets someone, THAT person has to donate the bloods... like stand near altar, and donate if you get targeted. Like a sacrific.
[4:50:34] onikudaki1871: turning in prob made him enrage? and take more dam
[4:50:35] misomander: yeah but he was enraged
[4:50:38] Cryptoji_Jojoji: he's enraged at that point
[4:50:38] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix he was below 20 inside the arena
[4:50:38] Brbgmafell: he may have a death wish type ability (more dmg but takes more dmg)
[4:50:38] wreckstormx: huh
[4:50:39] misomander: you can tell by health amount
[4:50:47] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix check the other attempt
[4:50:49] Deadge_Gartic: to see
[4:50:50] itsbrysontv: he's reading it @Savix
[4:50:53] ShakyFcknRob: Bruise is a mystery debuff that doesn't explain itself on the tooltip
[4:50:54] ImCakeAble: I heard it drops Martin Fury MONKA ALARMRED
[4:50:54] rourfoses: he was for sure getting clapped harder in the ring with all the men
[4:50:54] kingeider: hes massive from the blood handing in
[4:50:56] RollinSpinnas: After he gets to 20% he might just take more damage around altars
[4:50:57] Deadge_Gartic: if you do double damage
[4:50:57] Brbgmafell: maybe has warriori type abilities
[4:51:02] Brbgmafell: death wish
[4:51:05] Rogueone46: On layer 5 it was pure chaos and we did almost the same as u, so idk what to do, we did no strat
[4:51:07] Moonrake: Maybe he gets bigger the lower HP he has?
[4:51:08] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix check the other attempt you guys did
[4:51:09] Moonrake: just gradually?
[4:51:12] Deadge_Gartic: was also below 10%
[4:51:13] Cjpriest: its hard to tell witht he ears because we he had around 2k erars when we went in the arena
[4:51:14] Deadge_Gartic: without turning
[4:51:16] zachai313: homies feet were massive by the end
[4:51:20] Radioactivehusband: huh
[4:51:22] R_a_X: HUH
[4:51:22] ashtaroxx: uuh
[4:51:22] LyteGod: huh
[4:51:22] khaste_G: to be fair him getting bigger doesen't indicate him getting weaker tho Hmmge
[4:51:23] Arzondir: huh
[4:51:23] Andikun: no way its this hard, something we gotta do to make it easy. this is blizzard othings ever this difficult

[4:51:26] Turbonerd_TV: sus
[4:51:28] IFallDownLadders: hes got a massive pistol
[4:51:30] kickflipy: What if when he targets someone, THAT person has to donate the bloods... like stand near altar, and donate if you get targeted..
[4:51:32] rohmantv: look at the mans glutes!
[4:51:33] Tonyromoisreal: Arms Kreygasm
[4:51:33] lloydizm: WeirdChamp
[4:51:34] kteezy2020: his third arms probably pretty big
[4:51:38] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix check the prev attempt it was 8% ish so you can compare damage
[4:51:39] FeralTami: maybe we just keep turning in blood Hmmge
[4:51:39] ImCakeAble: How big is his p... ohshy
[4:51:42] wreckstormx: huh 󠀀
[4:51:45] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix check the prev attempt it was 8% ish so you can compare damage 󠀀
[4:51:45] slendy303030: Big hard third arm
[4:51:45] phopheter: why'd you hesitate to say arms Sus
[4:51:51] RollinSpinnas: No way its a kite mechanic
[4:51:52] wreckstormx: HUH
[4:51:52] Madwo: tuh
[4:51:53] PrimalTV: Christ can you imagine that
[4:51:53] Tonyromoisreal: Trolls have small dongs
[4:51:57] its_me_: all altars would take too long
[4:51:58] Andikun: I could see touching all altars..
[4:51:58] chef_heppo: One shot yall with his "greatswrd"
[4:52:00] Rogueone46: I was thinking about it
[4:52:02] jahnks212: What about the island off shore
[4:52:03] 209tomcat: Turn in at every altar
[4:52:03] Deadge_Gartic: yeah yeah
[4:52:03] Payo: AB?
[4:52:05] fertxunonimo: details didn't whow the damage on time for the boss?
[4:52:05] Deadge_Gartic: but you can compare
[4:52:07] Dano0212: search blizz forums for "I’ve solved Kha’Damu"
[4:52:08] alexjmartens: sounds like payo singing
[4:52:08] Deadge_Gartic: how much damage you did
[4:52:10] Dano0212: someone posted
[4:52:12] phopheter: om om
[4:52:17] crustydoodlesack: What happens if you try to pull him out of zone?
[4:52:19] dslevi: @Savix maybe try placing a player on every altar and turn in at the same time?
[4:52:20] rohmantv: i think when you kill him, the battle just ends.
[4:52:20] LyteGod: @Payo PayoCookie my little man
[4:52:20] Cryptoji_Jojoji: Watch it be "Opt out of event and kill him"
[4:52:24] rohmantv: no loot
[4:52:29] Cjpriest: although i guarantee if there wasnt so much lag where youre hitting 1 spell every 35 seconds its dead probably
[4:52:29] Sjure: Bigger please
[4:52:30] R_a_X: it's only hard because of the lag om i hit the boss like twice before dying so every individual person is doing like 1% normal dps
[4:52:32] Rogueone46: we have 30min, its a lot, prob we need to touch every altar with the boss
[4:52:35] LyteGod: @Savix Mr Payo is here to play AB with you sir PayoCookie
[4:52:35] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix you can compare how much damage you did , last attempt you were hitting 500-600
[4:52:37] Sjure: Thanks champ!
[4:53:00] ImCakeAble: eww
[4:53:01] Moonrake: you notice that the tooltip for the ears shows more than 255?
[4:53:01] misomander: ????
[4:53:03] DeviIsSpawn: @Savix so heres come quotes from him. Kha'damu yells: They thought I was weak. Haha!! Kha'damu yells: Tonight, your blood will run red on the stones of our altars. Kha'damu yells: Your skull gonna decorate our ritual altars!
[4:53:04] zachai313: HE WAS HUGE BRO
[4:53:06] Moonrake: even though the stack count says 255?
[4:53:11] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix you can compare how much damage you did , last attempt you were hitting 500-600 󠀀
[4:53:17] Rogueone46: @Moonrake I did
[4:53:22] ImCakeAble: Kite him onto the boat and bring him to barrens RAGEY
[4:53:25] BurntTunaTV: 90% sure its blood related and not arena related
[4:53:28] DeviIsSpawn: @maybe its has somethign to do with dieing on the alter
[4:53:30] rohmantv: @STREAMSNIPELUL READ THIS
[4:53:34] R_a_X: @ImCakeAble om
[4:53:35] ShakyFcknRob: 255 is just the max value the icon shows
[4:53:40] Dano0212: Blizz forums I’ve solved Kha’Damu
[4:53:42] Deadge_Gartic: bro
[4:53:46] Deadge_Gartic: he is not using real hp
[4:53:49] Deadge_Gartic: deadass
[4:53:55] DeviIsSpawn: @Savix  so maybe it has somethign to do with dieing on the alter by him. or turning in blood in by him
[4:53:57] Deadge_Gartic: or %
[4:54:01] Rogueone46: Look at his size, not inside the arena
[4:54:01] Skeetcannon79: its gotta do something with the blood good HAKKAR empowering him. i think it has something to do with dragging him to ZG
[4:54:03] ImCakeAble: Drown the boss RAGEY
[4:54:03] Moonrake: Yeah, I think the ears keep going up and he gains in size
[4:54:08] BurntTunaTV: thats what im saying, only you turned in haha
[4:54:09] DeviIsSpawn: @Savix Kha'damu yells: They thought I was weak. Haha!! Kha'damu yells: Tonight, your blood will run red on the stones of our altars. Kha'damu yells: Your skull gonna decorate our ritual altars!
[4:54:10] Moonrake: even though it says 255 stacks, he had 909
[4:54:11] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix you can compare how much damage you did , last attempt you were hitting 500-600 fuh
[4:54:21] winddexx: I always thought he just got bigger for killing players.
[4:54:27] geennaamnl1: @Savix The boss heals for twice as much damage he deals to you with his AOE. If you are in a raid group and wearing irradiated set, you can get 1 stamina, meaning that his aoe doesnt heal him. You can spirit rez and deal dps while not healing him. Its that simple. The problem is he is healing over 10 million+ every event..
[4:54:31] ChiefMango: @Savix he had like 1800 stacks when guzu tried earlier today
[4:54:32] Deadge_Gartic: and prev attempt you had the boss 8% better then this one
[4:54:38] FeralTami: what if we keep turning in blood until he becomes too big and explodes tuh
[4:54:39] nesprax13: i think u should clear icc first probably u can out dps then
[4:54:39] Deadge_Gartic: nono
[4:54:42] macjcool: We had 1270 ears at the end of the thing at ness
[4:54:49] Spikeqc: AYOO  󠀀
[4:54:50] Deadge_Gartic: last attempt average 500-600
[4:54:51] Cjpriest: @ChiefMango we had him at over 2300 just now
[4:54:51] MochiMurloc: @FeralTami Inflation tuh
[4:54:53] Deadge_Gartic: maybe crits 1k
[4:54:57] dips_ttv: 255 is what is shown, but i think icon is capped since 256 is a weird computer number
[4:54:57] FeralTami: @MochiMurloc HUH
[4:55:02] bathroom64: like little ants fighting a lion
[4:55:03] wreckstormx: savix little payo in the chat

[4:55:35] Dano0212: Search "I’ve solved Kha’Damu" on Blizz Forums @Savix
[4:55:38] DeviIsSpawn: @Savix i think hes saying what he needs.  Kha'damu yells: They thought I was weak. Haha!! Kha'damu yells: Tonight, your blood will run red on the stones of our altars. Kha'damu yells: Your skull gonna decorate our ritual altars!

[5:02:23] bathroom64: FeelsBadMan
[5:02:25] the_erayyy: Any*
[5:02:36] himynameisfolklore: What if you have to give blood to every altar in the zone before fighting the boss
[5:02:46] ImCakeAble: Listening
[5:02:49] misomander: i feel like theres just no way you need to drag it to every altar
[5:02:50] jonquiereconnor: Bro the AVATAR SOUNDTRACK?????
[5:02:52] R_a_X: can you drag him through the ZG portal?
[5:02:54] KosmicDevil_: i dont think anyone has tried bringing him to the big altar on the island in the north
[5:03:00] Kira_Corpse: what about yojamba?
[5:03:03] StreamElements: If you enjoy the content check out my other stuff! https://linktr.ee/Savixwastaken
[5:03:06] khaste_G: om
[5:03:10] misomander: if you think about it youre fighting like all the people in the zone on top of the boss
[5:03:15] Frostlicious: Try no blood dps
[5:03:16] PrimalTV: Unless the bruise eventually turns into a hemmorhage and THATS the blood he wants :thinking:
[5:03:23] Frostlicious: Phase 2
[5:03:42] shogun2255: @savix maybe in blood event someone need to turn in full 255 blood stacks near khadamu. it is SUS that boss shows 255 ear stacks but in reality has more
[5:03:47] Cjpriest: big brain
[5:03:52] ImCakeAble: ohJam
[5:03:59] MochiMurloc: puh MathTime
[5:04:00] BurntTunaTV: stack 1k blood one round and save for next run haha
[5:04:08] naturalduck: I think you guys are making up mechanics lool
[5:04:15] winddexx: Just keep boss on alter and players will naturally turn in
[5:04:17] R_a_X: @naturalduck let them cook om
[5:04:21] Deadge_Gartic: how about pre stack 1 event
[5:04:28] himynameisfolklore: Every altar needs blood. The altars act as a mechanic for the boss. Blood for the blood loa.

[5:13:50] gumgargler: very prosperous harvest
[5:14:02] MykeyP: @Savix have you guys figured out what did 50% of the boss's health in 5seconds, when it was in the gurubashi arena yesterday?
[5:14:06] RollinSpinnas: Itll either be a 50 ZF or 50 Sunken Temple Raid thing
[5:14:07] himynameisfolklore: Believe you have to turn in blood to every single altar before killing him

[5:19:43] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix this guy actually playing ssf deadass https://www.twitch.tv/xaryu 󠀀
[5:19:47] gumgargler: I think the boss is designed to be unkillable. his name is "u mad bro" backwards, ahk is bro in arabic and hebru
[5:19:59] aullywow: Maybe kite him to ashenvale event and have them fight to the death
[5:20:02] blindfira: I think it is Bruised, i was doing 450-500 damage Mortal Strikes at 7 bruised
[5:20:05] hmeag: Savix look up 'how to kill a loa' quest on wowhead. from the quest text "Dey get beaten as a test to make dem stronger. Any who fail de ritual are sacrificed. De ones who succeed are allowed to fight de Zandalari."

[5:23:55] paul_allenn: bbbb
[5:23:56] hmeag: but anyways my point about the quest text for "to kill a loa" literally says "get beaten to get stronger". Bruised has to be the way
[5:24:10] nuffedpips: wideMonkePls
[5:24:14] mageguy8: elisBall I think he takes more damage in p2 and you just need to burn him without the lag or griefing
[5:24:22] Spikeqc: pauseChamp
[5:24:38] phopheter: GuzuStareChamp
[5:24:49] aphashia: My theory. 100-20%, the boss heals from players not having blood. At 20%, he stops healing so you turn in the blood to further weaken him.
[5:25:03] R_a_X: AYAYA
[5:25:16] justjabl: If that is the case getting him to 20% quickly is the most important thing giving you more time to kill him under 20.
[5:25:19] mageguy8: elisBall you did double the damage p2 so it's 7mil
[5:25:24] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix i found out how to make it bigger i think you should study this HmmNotes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3B7M-3KfrA

[5:26:06] Aopcloud: I don’t think kiting is the mechanic, to much coordination. You need to stack blood to kill him (you lose your blood if he kills you) I believe bruised means your damage is negated against him

[6:46:16] Deadge_Gartic: @Adam_of_Aurae fuh
[6:46:20] Panchen1290: @Savix the first time the GM pulled him to the altar, so I think it's the blood, not the arena
[6:46:21] TylerTan213: Polar and wood department doing it on Layer 3 we will let you know how it goes :)

[6:48:31] Nebulas2: thats why the gm dragged him ther
[6:48:50] Panchen1290: @Savix that's why the GM pulled him to the altar
[6:48:52] khaste_G: and the fact that GM tanked the boss at the altar
[6:49:03] Naboo69: @sunken_couch if you type nier automata pascal song it is this song savixL

[6:49:23] English_Uk: Just nuke him
[6:49:24] slendy303030: Turn in blood at start
[6:49:26] ChipDouglasx: does he only get bigger once he hits 20%?
[6:49:28] English_Uk: i think were over thinking it

[6:49:32] D4KiR: boss gets more HP but also get more dmg

[6:49:36] Emil129c: everyone go naked and have tons of people farm max blood and feed the boss and boom he explode cus he got to much blood wow
[6:49:38] EricaPrydz: you can’t turn in blood at the start because he will heal
[6:49:39] HidekiKojima: Are those savix getting discord pings? LULW
[6:49:39] MortyShippuden: @Savix Maybe he collects the blood that gets turned into the alter when he touches it
[6:49:41] English_Uk: if we had no lag we would have killed it the last time
[6:49:42] falkorUzumaki: turn in first so it’s a clear yes or no
[6:49:42] Rosster19er: you've tried adding blood at the end already. Try it early.
[6:49:43] Adam_of_Aurae: HypePopcorn theorycrafting and testing the world boss.
[6:49:46] English_Uk: yeah sounds like a plan lafs
[6:49:46] JustTheZap: You need blood to stop him from healing until 20% right? hand in after that?
[6:49:46] darksorrow87: horde gets the blood alliance gets the kill
[6:49:47] English_Uk: lads
[6:49:50] lMethodl: if he gains HP at 20% you should turn in at first so you can get to the 20% as fast as possible since it doesnt look like he heals at 20%
[6:49:57] catbalou2: Didnt we already find out that in phase 1 he just heals off no blood players?
