[0:28:32] Begasaur: have surgery Monday
[0:28:34] DigitalBodyBuilder: Ret rogue? Hmmm as assa, outlaw or sub?
[0:28:37] ImPlutooo: Are those all the abilities you use or do you have them hidden?
[0:29:09] happyheals: he keeps his luckdoos out of views
[0:29:16] Begasaur: its pretty standard, stiches on the inside for now then tossing some skin on it
[0:29:16] happyheals: luckydoos
[0:30:22] Begasaur: yeah i mean its just infected and wide open atm, so they jsut gotta get it clean and closed. he did say theres no way to prevent a nasty scar at thsi point tho
[0:30:44] Begasaur: but also no work for a week as it heals cuz im on my feet for 10 hours a day at work. which is a no go
[0:30:55] Begasaur: plus i wont be able to lift kegs even if i did go to work
[0:30:56] Devcomz: The Druid disrespected and died
[0:31:20] internet_bob: scars are cool
[0:31:23] internet_bob: ur chillin
[0:31:41] ItsMeRevolt: i’m not gonna lie i was away, so i don’t know if you said anything abt my comment
[0:31:43] Begasaur: yeah its on my inner thigh high up,99% of the world will never see it
[0:32:13] internet_bob: that 1% tho
[0:32:19] Begasaur: yeah they stapled it and that didnt take then they stiched it, that didnt take. and now its started to heal so it wont close on its own with just top stiches
[0:32:23] americanmoses18: wuts the plan tonight mes
[0:32:26] nikthevoker: just mes thho
[0:32:43] happyheals: yeah, Chicks always like my scars, I have a big one on my left inner thigh and it won't affect you  like you may think
[0:33:24] Begasaur: to put it in perspective its prolly 4 inches long, 2 inches wide and deep atm. so its somethign that wont really heal properly without attention
[0:33:56] happyheals: that is fine, just have a cool story for it
[0:34:04] Begasaur: its in a bad spot too cuz it has trouble closing because of walking and stuff
[0:34:14] Begasaur: yeah im not too worried about it, i just want it to be done with tho

[1:33:28] nikthevoker: aup @notmes
[1:36:34] Taevenx: It fun that everyone thinks Ret is just going to be insane on Tuesday :)
[1:37:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rets are not going to be the worst, that's for sure
[1:37:07] Taevenx: I think they'll pale in comparison to Lock
[1:37:34] BuCh3RCSGO: rets number 1 total dmg dealer is getting 10% increase, + their highest hitting ability gets 20%
[1:38:14] happyheals: Rets will be somewhere between 0 and 28% better at existing
[1:38:23] robdudeguylol: locks also gaining health
[1:38:43] Lythi: isnt demo getting dmg through having more hp?
[1:38:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: If demo does a lot of physical damage, they gain damage against plate and lose some against clothies
[1:38:53] robdudeguylol: rets the new sub?
[1:39:00] happyheals: Ret will pair with rogue better since it has more single target now
[1:39:10] Taevenx: I've been playing Ret all night, getting beaten in Damage/Healing every map to mages, DK, DH, Locks and warriors
[1:39:33] Lythi: i´m 100% expecting caster meta, rogue mage, and ret/hunter next week
[1:39:48] Dreddmar: Ret is getting a bunch of buffs on Tuesday
[1:39:50] Lythi: RPS also looking nice with those shadow buffs
[1:40:08] happyheals: maybe, since dh didnt lose armor
[1:40:16] happyheals: but the power ret gained
[1:40:58] happyheals: someone like the Almighty Beefdaddyx could clean house
[1:40:58] Taevenx: idk, I just hope the gameplay feels better than it does now
[1:41:13] Lythi: is ilvl that massive atm? i got a late start to the season cause of raiding and now it just feels like i´m getting farmed
[1:41:28] Lythi: they suck in raids, but are great in M+ i think
[1:41:35] Dreddmar: arent they like 2nd to last in the raid damage?
[1:41:55] typsybro: does anyone know any multi gladiator windwalker monks that stream?
[1:42:29] robdudeguylol: trill is multiglad ww
[1:42:39] dawsonator171: chunli might stream WW play
[1:42:56] typsybro: okay cool ty !
[1:43:06] happyheals: Venruki maybe on his monk
[1:43:07] robdudeguylol: chun has been doing devoker
[1:43:08] BuCh3RCSGO: thats why u pair the lock with another caster :D
[1:43:12] Taevenx: Ret is weird, hard to get them in a good spot that they feel good but aren't also insane
[1:45:04] himpnote: ez
[1:45:20] happyheals: That dk looks like he has thrown a few gnomes in his day
[1:45:39] happyheals: the toolkit is top tier
[1:46:21] BuCh3RCSGO: they get reduced armor tho? so compared to other melees
[1:47:07] happyheals: because other classes got one shotty type win conditions'
[1:48:34] happyheals: I'm gearing mine
[1:48:46] happyheals: so they must be good
[1:48:47] BuCh3RCSGO: ahh good point

[2:54:04] bot_3_2_1: it will ofc
[2:54:05] krome2dadome: u know what's hilarious
[2:54:09] anmusallam: but didnt they nerf their armor
[2:54:10] bot_3_2_1: shield mail
[2:54:16] happyheals: I was thinking that even though warrior guaredian right?
[2:54:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mail with shield, it's possible yeah
[2:54:26] Begasaur: my ele has like 10.5k or so atm
[2:54:29] krome2dadome: @notmes u know what's hilarious
[2:54:31] bot_3_2_1: but funny how they nerf rshsman armor but ele not
[2:55:03] happyheals: guardian druid
[2:55:13] happyheals: not yet
[2:55:19] krome2dadome: warr getting nerfed 5% on tuesday KEKW
[2:55:21] happyheals: lol
[2:55:30] happyheals: that was what I meant
[2:55:40] happyheals: thewy are forcing you to shift more
[2:55:48] anmusallam: @krome2dadome i hear they lost strength over the changes
[2:55:52] happyheals: use the new talents they spent so long on
[2:58:02] happyheals: lol everything I did to make the faction change got reset and I gotta do it again
[2:59:21] happyheals: I gotta leave it
[2:59:45] Sundagar: druid mana pool in 2s is a joke lol
[2:59:56] bot_3_2_1: what are meta classes on na rn ? id say on eu its mostly dh, dk ,ele ,outlaw, arcane and healerwise probably 70% rduirds , 20% rshamans
[3:00:08] avenueone: ggs
[3:00:20] happyheals: I saw a lot of priest at around 2k
[3:00:38] ZallKlos: is trying to tab dot everything on 3s a mistake? especially when enemies are all spread
[3:00:47] krome2dadome: @bot_3_2_1 pretty much the same with more boomy instead of ele and more sub instead of outlaw
[3:00:49] anmusallam: are u ready for awc :)
[3:01:43] happyheals: Is AWC ready for him?
[3:01:50] happyheals: always remember that
[3:01:50] bot_3_2_1: @krome2dadome na sleeping on ele then i swear :D
[3:03:52] happyheals: Ele is sleeping with NA\

[3:05:00] 인터넷포트: Demo locks fitn to win blizcon

[3:05:09] 인터넷포트: Warrior Demo Spec
[3:05:11] afriKENx: BUFF WARLOCK
[3:05:11] ForsakenTV3: everyone will basically be mail armor
[3:05:26] afriKENx: theres not on demo tree
[3:05:43] ohshiieett: ?? how do locks have 8k armor
[3:06:41] DBMezzy: axe?
[3:06:44] DBMezzy: where bro
[3:06:57] DBMezzy: or its shit
[3:07:06] afriKENx: smexxin
[3:07:08] afriKENx: bias
[3:08:52] Croix4: whats the map pool this week
[3:08:58] vuldronx: The health changes are very good for DK, but guess who also benefits alot from more health? Warlocks, so not only will they be tankier than every other melee, they're defensives will also be stronger
[3:08:59] afriKENx: i think the break % has been fucked all expac
[3:09:10] afriKENx: bc it was balanced around the condiut
[3:09:12] happyheals: warrior prob benefits more than we realize from the change
[3:09:30] bot_3_2_1: imagine playing against magle lock druid without any roots and fears breaking
[3:09:32] bot_3_2_1: gonna be nice
[3:09:59] serratedlove: priest fear has a cd to be fair
[3:09:59] Jubite: flat % of hp might be best
[3:10:01] afriKENx: i think instant dmg should break fear faster
[3:10:05] afriKENx: but dots should do less
[3:10:07] whirr: what if it's not that big of an increase, 100% of not a lot may still be not a lot
[3:10:10] happyheals: we are talking about the difference in 1 tick of a small dot and 2 ticks
[3:10:19] redrum4209: its the same shit as stuns tho
[3:10:19] dawsonator171: being scared to death is not fun
[3:10:29] happyheals: it isn't like you can attack them  and not break it\
[3:10:29] jo4sho85: so dk blind will not break so frost might be able to one shot open right?
[3:11:16] Cybernytez: yo mes, i have the option to gear a human or a tauren ret, which one should i gear ? :D
[3:11:22] Jubite: changes have a ton of thought in em. like the random boomkin armor cut
[3:11:35] sunileif: its cause the devs working on pvp now never played legion and before
[3:11:40] petkicklol: boomkins needed that armor cut lol
[3:11:53] Jubite: they were too tanky

[3:12:24] Jubite: it only feels bad because everything else went tits up
[3:12:51] happyheals: the changes seem to force druids to use the new talents like master shapeshifter paired with call of the elder druid
[3:12:51] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[3:13:00] bot_3_2_1: they reset hp numbers to 50-100k in sl ss1 and 1 addon later were back at 1mil
[3:13:25] Cybernytez: bruh why is hpal involved ? i played 2s on hpal today you literally cant survive DH or WW at all no matter if u fakecast, they dont even kick bc they now u cant heal that
[3:13:32] steebet: they're just working on making warlocks tanks in retail, just like SOD Kappa
[3:13:49] dawsonator171: they nerf armor on plate classes and evis at the same time, because plate classes should still be killable by rogues.
[3:13:52] petkicklol: @Cybernytez hpals are just meh in 2s
[3:14:08] happyheals: bm prob doing well with less armor for pets to attack
[3:14:14] dawsonator171: do you think there is a spec alternate you would use with legendary?
[3:14:18] Cybernytez: i know but why armor nerf for hpal as well man blows my mind @petkicklol  :D
[3:15:09] Jubite: i wish theyd write half a sentence to explain their reasoning
[3:15:18] petkicklol: feel like hpal does fine into physical stuff rn anyways
[3:15:34] ohshiieett: what? the armor for mages isn't gonna be a big deal
[3:15:37] raccoondevous: im going for my first glad this season and our comp is hpal unholy and dh but these changes worry me >.<
[3:15:37] Drathimos: this allows mm to get buffed without worrying that its gona one shot cloth
[3:15:38] happyheals: oof I didn't think that way
[3:15:50] bot_3_2_1: arcane mage with more armor and hp is gonna be unkillable :)
[3:16:05] redrum4209: dks gonna feel so ass into mele comps now
[3:16:15] Cybernytez: not only arcane frost mage is also pretty tanky man
[3:16:20] ZallKlos: it's a plot to make dk play bloodforge
[3:17:11] petkicklol: wonder if a 2nd wep for stoneskin garg will be worth into some stuff next season
[3:17:23] sillysheepweepandsleep: is the dot build good
[3:17:49] petkicklol: i guess fallen crusader scales off hp too
[3:17:55] petkicklol: i was thinkin for the hp
[3:17:56] petkicklol: yea it is
[3:18:06] petkicklol: i was thinkin for the stam part ye
[3:18:13] happyheals: makes vers more important methinks
[3:18:26] petkicklol: stoneskin with 2% increase?
[3:18:56] bot_3_2_1: do you play bursting specc or dotspecc more
[3:19:24] Croix4: what will we drop for bloodforge?
[3:20:00] petkicklol: will strang even be that good either if its a damp meta tho
[3:20:21] Dudewuut: stoneskin is 6% armor and 6% all stats tho base @notmes
[3:20:29] DBMezzy: @petkicklol what about 25% nerf to necro? that sounds huge tbh
[3:21:02] petkicklol: sounds huge prob wont be that big of a deal
[3:21:17] petkicklol: @Dudewuut u have unholy bond on nprob why its showin that
[3:21:18] dawsonator171: @petkicklol it's always good. I like choking people.
[3:21:29] WagwanBombaClatBomba: fallen crusader is just to good
[3:21:33] jo4sho85: so after tues we go pet build
[3:21:34] Dudewuut: @petkicklol oh im a retard yeah
[3:22:00] WagwanBombaClatBomba: and u lose passive heal
[3:22:01] magnesiium1: you lose the trinket bonus pretty much
[3:22:11] WagwanBombaClatBomba: y
[3:23:22] petkicklol: i was just thinking have a 2nd wep
[3:23:29] petkicklol: into some matchups
[3:23:34] petkicklol: not use it ev game
[3:24:14] petkicklol: i swear sores is better for matchups like that too
[3:24:23] petkicklol: cause its easier to stop drinks with a 34 sec duration dot
[3:24:34] petkicklol: not for dam just cause ebon fever cuts the duration in half
[3:25:05] jo4sho85: would a tanky bloodforge and pet build not be viable ?
[3:25:05] petkicklol: yea thats my thought process behind it
[3:25:24] petkicklol: pets arent reliable really
[3:27:00] petkicklol: feel like we wont really
[3:27:07] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i dont think we will
[3:27:23] c0jaK: mesMath
[3:27:55] happyheals: people will just say it was the nerfs and others will believe it if they hear it enough
[3:28:39] happyheals: more stam mean a higher tick for ysera's gift
[3:28:54] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i swear i wont feel a diff, especially when i have the lego trenXD
[3:29:28] happyheals: just gushing wounds
[3:30:03] al_capow: mes how’s the sod alt coming?
[3:30:06] happyheals: I was running around 97% haste and it made kitty weaving good
[3:30:09] petkicklol: what about the coil one
[3:30:37] al_capow: I won’t make raid Monday so the bow better not drop
[3:30:50] JustTaki: i think so
[3:31:09] DBMezzy: whats ur mastery in pvp
[3:31:21] krome2dadome: Bedge gl with Qs
[3:31:33] DBMezzy: necrotic also heals u a lot
[3:31:57] DBMezzy: necrto is like passive healing really good as well
[3:32:09] DBMezzy: but like 25% less
[3:32:13] happyheals: and hp went up to cover a portion of it
[3:33:54] afriKENx: must be nice when your class is so tanky you can play adapt
[3:33:54] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:36:33] krome2dadome: the fact that team can get 2.6
[3:36:37] krome2dadome: blows my mind
[3:37:15] happyheals: rdruids can just change 1 talent to get mana throughout the battle
[3:37:34] WagwanBombaClatBomba: its gonna be really intresting to see how meta will be on wed
[3:38:09] Croix4: Yay rls
[3:38:14] Croix4: hate to see it
[3:39:39] happyheals: druids encouraged to change form and dps fill for mana. Wrath gives 2k mana per cast
[3:41:32] WagwanBombaClatBomba: HAHAHAHAH
[3:44:36] WagwanBombaClatBomba: trill, ¨SHAT TEH FAK UP DUD¨
[3:44:40] WagwanBombaClatBomba: jazggzOMEGAKEK
[3:44:49] happyheals: if you are being attacked by a melee you are Why can't Warriors just wear cloth now
[3:45:19] happyheals: I forgot to delete an old sentence
[3:46:06] steebet: @happyheals happy accident
[3:46:14] steebet: KappaRoss
[3:46:15] GamerKrown: Outside of the outliers I feel like the season is very well balanced. So strange to see it completely changed in one patch
[3:46:16] avenueone: the wake of ashes buff is kinda because ret spec suffers 20% loss ST with aoe spec in PVE
[3:46:27] WagwanBombaClatBomba: we expected a small fotball of changes, instead we got a big ass cannonball jazggzOMEGAKEK
[3:46:28] avenueone: so its kinda the only thing they can buff that improved both aoe and st specs
[3:46:40] happyheals: happyheals gifted a Tier 1 sub to BobRoss! They have given 323 Gift Subs in the channel!

[3:47:01] WagwanBombaClatBomba: the hp buffs benefits rsham alot
[3:47:11] WagwanBombaClatBomba: more time for shaman to press buttons
[3:47:14] WagwanBombaClatBomba: and totems get more hp
[3:47:37] anmusallam: Do you think blizz didn’t think the changes through? @notmes
[3:47:58] happyheals: so splash attacks don't clear a mass entagle
[3:48:23] happyheals: learning it
[3:48:40] happyheals: free'
[3:48:49] happyheals: no spell cost for mass
[3:48:52] BigBrain_B: Thinking about getting back into wow, what do you suggest is in a better place at the moment Unholy DK or Affliction lock?
[3:49:29] Minikoal: @BigBrain_B  afflock for sureee
[3:49:32] happyheals: Affliction Lock has more armor now
[3:49:41] happyheals: well on
[3:49:43] happyheals: Tuesday
[3:49:49] WagwanBombaClatBomba: warlocks will have more armor then us mes
[3:49:55] WagwanBombaClatBomba: what a joke man
[3:49:56] BigBrain_B: Thanks @Minikoal and @happyheals
[3:49:58] WagwanBombaClatBomba: jazggzOMEGAKEK
[3:50:03] sunileif: tbh i think the armor changes were so random BG players stop complaining about gettign wrecked by mm hunters
[3:50:11] WagwanBombaClatBomba: guys
[3:50:19] WagwanBombaClatBomba: cloth armor having more armor then plate
[3:50:21] WagwanBombaClatBomba: HAHAHAHHA

[3:54:12] wowsuomi: Locks get good vaule from armor
[3:54:12] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[3:54:27] happyheals: they will eventually force everyone to wear coliseum gear
[3:54:36] Drathimos: @sunileif happens in arena too. mm finally was good last season but it made all the clothies cry. mm is not allowed to be good for long because of that
[3:55:00] wowsuomi: And also tbf hpallys, it never felt like the armor ever did anything anyway
[3:55:10] happyheals: Boomkins will ironfur and gain astral power for a quick burst kite strat or something
[3:55:23] Drathimos: just remove armor types in pvp. if 80% of the specs already ignore armor type why not just make it all
[3:55:57] happyheals: at 466 ilvl 10,166 armor
[3:56:11] wowsuomi: Thats pretty much what i thought about reforging at the time when playing cata
[3:56:12] happyheals: beare 17349
[3:57:38] sunileif: or none
[3:58:53] wowsuomi: I'm pretty sure i can't remember the reason i hated reforging was just because u can reforge everything doesn't mean they need to invent alot of pointless loot with the wrong stats on it
[3:58:55] tzunamiDK: What addon does mes use for his runes?
[4:00:04] wowsuomi: It felt like a gold sink at the time
[4:01:26] avenueone: !runes
[4:01:27] Nightbot: it’s !points
[4:01:27] StreamElements: Use addon in !scripts or use: /run RuneFrame:ClearAllPoints() RuneFrame:SetPoint("CENTER",UIParent,"CENTER", 6,-75) RuneFrame.SetPoint = function() end RuneFrame:SetScale(1.5)
[4:01:34] avenueone: @tsunamiDK ^^
[4:03:52] avenueone: robbed
[4:04:14] artsskeit: nerf dk

[4:05:00] happyheals: FIN
[4:05:03] avenueone: i used to love those burgers from kfc
[4:05:06] avenueone: the double or whatever
[4:05:11] xiliketurtlex: does armor effect how much magic damage you take?

[4:05:24] happyheals: I tried it one time when I was in the Army
[4:05:31] xiliketurtlex: or is it just for pure physical damage?
[4:05:38] tzunamiDK: thx!
[4:05:46] Drathimos: only physical
[4:05:49] happyheals: Armor only affects physical
[4:05:51] WagwanBombaClatBomba: shit is crazy man
[4:05:54] avenueone: kfc does that 2 fillets as the bun
[4:06:01] healhut: maybe blizz's thought process is that normalizing physical dam reduction between classes will make tuning certain abilities easier.
[4:06:04] avenueone: but not all the time (here)
[4:06:17] artsskeit: that sounds.. interesting
[4:06:20] xiliketurtlex: so armor nerf on plate wont be effected againsy wizards?
[4:06:20] tzunamiDK: Is the legendary any good for pvp? Or it big nerfed?
[4:06:21] artsskeit: alexa nearest kfc to me
[4:06:21] Drathimos: @beep101boop 100%
[4:06:34] happyheals: Warriors and Ret have abilities to change type of dam

[4:09:42] happyheals: THATS LIKE 9000 A SECOND
[4:10:01] basementdwellingvirginx: no way the be starcraft players had like 350-400?

[4:12:04] happyheals: RQD2

[5:06:14] happyheals: For anyone wondering the hoodies have either a centered larger logo or a smaller Polo style Positioned logo
[5:06:24] shugguls: imagine if iron made made his suit out of cloth, thanos would have lost way faster

[5:39:03] Pwnyo808: just a fully waterproof keyb
[5:39:12] happyheals: I have comps youi can wash with a hose and cleaner

[5:47:52] diuoe: yeah, when my nameplates overlap in m+, moonfire is blocking my ability to swap targets
[5:47:55] diuoe: because it isn't clickthru

[5:53:21] Cybernytez: if my hpal dies even faster now ill never play hpal again
[5:53:27] isseswagger: and sub rogues be like, who cares about armor I deal shadow dmg heheehe

[5:54:03] kzloxxx: Well. I see a lot of ppl complaining about melee dominance on ranks and the absurd amount of instant CC's, especially on rogues.
[5:54:07] afriKENx: they will remove the warlock armor talent
[5:54:15] kzloxxx: But I agree locks are going to be insane rn
[5:54:16] afriKENx: it was added this season
[5:54:20] afriKENx: we didnt have it last

[5:54:30] isseswagger: metamorphosis coming back due to sod being a success probably
[5:54:34] Imagine_TBH: I hate fighting mages and warlocks... they just constantly port away and you can't get close to them at all
[5:54:37] sgrdaddyx: one last swing before removing locks from game hehe
[5:54:37] happyheals: Warlock is usually the kill target. I saw them on PVP arena logs at 70.1% first blood
[5:54:46] happyheals: for that day
[5:54:53] Imagine_TBH: In BGs I just run away from them, cos they suck to fight
[5:54:57] kzloxxx: @happyheals if u let them free cast, ur fkd.
[5:54:58] Itankarenas: yeah, I get focus in 95% of my games as destro
[5:55:25] Itankarenas: the other 5% I have an aff lock on my team KEKW
[5:55:29] darrenchen2000: hey mes, what are your thoughts on unholy changes?
[5:55:36] AstralScare: locks die at high ratings to double melee too
[5:55:44] AstralScare: they need rdruid as well
[5:55:47] AstralScare: or they don't live
[5:56:04] happyheals: can locks port while rooted?
[5:56:08] AstralScare: Destro is getting destroyed
[5:56:12] afriKENx: yeah
[5:56:13] Imagine_TBH: Think about the warlock armour buff in RBGs and in future the Blitz... no one will fight them, they will be immortal
[5:56:14] AstralScare: demo is ok
[5:56:19] AstralScare: WW DK
[5:56:22] afriKENx: destro is good into melee

[5:56:31] yepx1: WW destroys destro
[5:56:31] janaasen93: Dk nerfs is huge?
[5:56:33] happyheals: I would think unholy dk ww or dh or warr
[5:56:36] afriKENx: well destro is better
[5:56:36] Itankarenas: ww is actually annoying af as destro if my 2nd dps cant peel for shit
[5:56:38] AstralScare: WW puts port on top of the port of the lock
[5:56:39] afriKENx: than the other 2 specs
[5:56:41] AstralScare: DH cant kite that
[5:56:44] afriKENx: by a lot
[5:56:49] lockxdots: ww destroys lock
[5:56:53] lockxdots: dh destroys lock
[5:56:56] happyheals: I mean just starting tuesday
[5:56:57] Yoskexz: when u guys vs warlocks and kidnap them wif oxkick/shaman knocks it seems hopeless for the lock
[5:57:09] kzloxxx: I see a lot of low to mid ranked ppl complaining about melee dominance on ranks and the absurd amount of instant CC's, especially on rogues. They're probably trying to focus on those ppl, wich I guess is the majority of players. dunno
[5:57:36] Itankarenas: I have like 0 problems with rogue as destro in shuffle
[5:57:45] janaasen93: Why are they  nerfing necro wounds  even more?
[5:58:04] afriKENx: i think what healer you have matters the most for lock
[5:58:04] happyheals: adding more health
[5:58:09] lockxdots: melee is def king rn wouldnt you say? especially with rdruid
[5:58:22] AstralScare: @afriKENx yep
[5:58:35] AstralScare: in shuffle if u dont have rdruid its really hard for the lock for example
[5:58:35] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:58:42] AstralScare: in 3s they are always with rdruid
[5:58:58] AstralScare: we need to wait and see the changes tbh
[5:59:30] lockxdots: ya
[5:59:51] Itankarenas: rdruid is great for lock cuz u can port with hots on you. I dont think it's necessary or even hard in shuffle without them tho
[6:00:37] Itankarenas: I only ever struggle with priests it feels like
[6:00:43] lockxdots: rdruid is best heals rn for arena 100%
[6:00:48] happyheals: All I am picturing is 5 abilities that root and allow longer gos on kill targets
[6:01:16] janaasen93: How is dk looking  after the nerfs?
[6:01:24] xiliketurtlex: should do prediction tier list for next patch
[6:01:47] lockxdots: im just shocked dh didnt get nerfed in some way
[6:01:52] DirtyYankee0: ^
[6:02:18] kzloxxx: But I do agree, with awc starting 31. It's a massive change and a short time to adapt
[6:02:19] DirtyYankee0: warlock will just be absolutely fucked
[6:02:20] lockxdots: dh has no weakness tbh, also outlaw
[6:02:21] kzloxxx: It's kinda insane
[6:02:55] Mfgergo: as a PHDK player im shocked dk got nerfed  was it really that op?
[6:02:56] DirtyYankee0: ret doesnt seem like a good enough melee to kill warlock so idk if anything can
[6:03:00] lockxdots: besides outlaw i am saying
[6:03:34] lockxdots: dh and ww are good into lock, warr not so much anymore
[6:03:56] happyheals: Ret will be very good since they have a talent that turns some physical attacks into Holystrike dmg
[6:04:08] janaasen93: Necro wounds  is so bad
[6:04:16] Itankarenas: DKs already didnt seem that tanky. That + the armor nerf seems like it might hurt a lot
[6:04:35] kzloxxx: Lock is already a cloth tankish class, great self heals. Making their armor go higher than a plate class is strange tbh
[6:04:58] DirtyYankee0: what specifically about that makes it good? @happyheals
[6:05:01] frostynu: I think they just got bored of rock paper scissors and they want all classes to be the same and have the same abilities
[6:05:26] Itankarenas: ret has easy GOs doesnt it?
[6:05:32] xiliketurtlex: isnt necro wound nerf just adjusting to health boost that everyones getting??
[6:05:35] lockxdots: ppl are acting like dhs and wws dont shred locks rn though, maybe they stand a chance with more armor
[6:05:37] Itankarenas: and it's just stronger across the board now
[6:05:43] avenueone: the ret change goes into a mini go every 30 secs
[6:05:45] happyheals: turns physical attacks into spell damage to avoid the 30% arfmor buff
[6:05:51] happyheals: methinks
[6:06:07] afriKENx: @happyheals thats already half the melle in the game
[6:06:08] DirtyYankee0: ah yes I see @happyheals
[6:06:09] afriKENx: melee*
[6:06:21] Cybernytez: windwalkers are also buffed passively witht the plate nerfs
[6:06:37] DirtyYankee0: but nerfed to the cloth buffs @Cybernytez
[6:07:12] Cybernytez: mh ye but everyone is nerfed passively against cloth
[6:07:21] DirtyYankee0: true
[6:07:50] lockxdots: i just dont hear enough ppl talking about rdruid, ww, dh and outlaw rn though. Everyone is fixated on lock but look at the ladder
[6:07:52] kzloxxx: US solo shuffle. No 1 and 2 are destro locks, imagine with more armor & health
[6:07:58] kzloxxx: omegalul OMEGALUL
[6:08:03] shugguls: just going to be outlaw demo again
[6:08:10] afriKENx: @lockxdots everyone complain about rdruid and rogue lol
[6:08:10] janaasen93: Dk should always have most dmg and be abit tanky since  they have bad defensiv and mobility
[6:08:28] Cybernytez: time to gear out my lock i guess
[6:08:43] StreamElements: FM just ordered Notmes Hoodie PogChamp
[6:08:45] lockxdots: and yet no nerds @afriKENx
[6:08:57] lockxdots: nerfs*
[6:09:02] lockxdots: not nerds*
[6:09:02] happyheals: You are welcome
[6:09:03] DirtyYankee0: the problem is that when lock is  op it is unkillable and just a complete throw to not run lock
[6:09:11] happyheals: I wanted a 3rd one
[6:09:20] afriKENx: @lockxdots rdruid is getting nerfed
[6:09:22] happyheals: I like the material
[6:09:32] Itankarenas: Worst part about lock is changing talents and having to summon pets and healthstones before every round Sadge first world problems
[6:09:41] happyheals: It is fun to overcome the changes if possible
[6:09:52] lockxdots: rogue is always OP, every ssn
[6:09:59] lockxdots: name 1 time it wasnt insane
[6:10:09] Aetecii: Now the question is, demo or destro?
[6:10:21] Itankarenas: demo for 3s destro for shuffle
[6:10:33] dawsonator171: Would you wanna queue when i finish this?
[6:11:24] happyheals: I had 5 druids logging in slands
[6:11:47] kzloxxx: lorewise locks are the strongest class in wow, guess they're trying to follow wow lore YEPGUNS
[6:12:14] happyheals: low representation could mean not fun enough to play for people to make alts of it
[6:12:20] lockxdots: based on the number of destro lock players, its representation is not high (compared to previous ssns)
[6:12:23] AdrecoTV: statistics can not be taken for face value without context like you are giving here
[6:12:23] jBeastwood: rogue is hard
[6:12:24] Screwling2107: how are hunters currently?
[6:12:30] BetterHalfGaming: BetterHalfGaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Thanks to @johnnythunderbunny for my sub gift!
[6:12:31] StreamElements: BetterHalfGaming just subscribed for 18 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[6:12:35] mouro52: Representation is low because rogues are hard
[6:12:45] Cybernytez: yeah you cant go after representation, you can go after winrate ^^ thats what ive always said i actually compared winrates of healers in s2 i think
[6:12:45] DirtyYankee0: I would say lorewise mages are the strongest, or maybe death knights @kzloxxx
[6:12:59] sunileif: it cause even rogue players dont wanna be rogues
[6:13:05] dawsonator171: maybe it's because rogues are so easy they don't take practice. Step 1 stun. Step 2 watch DR. step 3 Stun again.
[6:13:17] happyheals: Not all Rogues come out of stealth. Hard to get an accurate count
[6:13:22] kzloxxx: only pikaboo spams rogue queue lol
[6:13:24] kzloxxx: man loves it
[6:13:42] DJ_HappyDays: nahj could be the exception to the rule lol
[6:13:46] jBeastwood: Rogue is only fun with the right comps and right people u have synergy with
[6:14:01] happyheals: he asks what people want him to play next and whatnot
[6:14:05] happyheals: Pika
[6:14:16] kzloxxx: Yeah
[6:14:16] happyheals: pretty diverse
[6:14:17] lockxdots: I dont see a bunch of non-lock players making locks though. If it were insane they would make one. Look at the new DH and WWs popping up
[6:14:18] DirtyYankee0: pika 3s count not that high I bet
[6:14:39] kzloxxx: Pika likes 2v2 a lot
[6:14:42] kzloxxx: to have fun
[6:14:46] happyheals: don't give too much data so they won't nerf the class lol
[6:14:46] kzloxxx: cuz he can kill 1v2 lot of times
[6:14:48] kzloxxx: lol
[6:15:13] mouro52: Its better for the game if rets are OP cuz people like playing ret more than most specs :D
[6:15:31] TheSingleBest: I think rogues take a lot of mental energy to play, so it gets mentally exhausting. You have so many options that you have to constantly be aware of everything
[6:15:49] lockxdots: Rogue has the highest skillcap imo
[6:15:56] lockxdots: no doubt
[6:15:57] dawsonator171: what if all these rogues are playing low level purposely?
[6:16:00] DirtyYankee0: my exact reason why I dont play it @TheSingleBest
[6:16:08] diuoe: skill floor =/= skillcap
[6:16:32] happyheals: Shadow priest used to be fairly high but they have destroyed the spec a few times
[6:16:36] jBeastwood: @TheSingleBest this. the other specs are more zug which is just kinda more fun. setup feels great when executed but is draining
[6:16:39] lockxdots: DH for instance my 6 year old nephew could q
[6:17:02] darrenchen2000: mes will dk build stay same after changes
[6:17:10] afriKENx: winning gets boring
[6:17:12] kzloxxx: I remember when websites could track the % of class players
[6:17:13] afriKENx: look at meh
[6:17:17] brazkat: how do you think changes will effect hpal?
[6:17:17] Itankarenas: it's fun to watch, but you really gotta enjoy it to play it
[6:17:19] darrenchen2000: necro aura ?
[6:17:21] happyheals: Prob people start them and get murdered a lot and just quit
[6:17:23] kzloxxx: rogues, monks and locks were always <7%
[6:17:24] DirtyYankee0: people say DH is so easy to play and maybe the rotation is but dh is not an easy class to play at high levels
[6:17:50] happyheals: Most people don't play at high levels though
[6:17:55] GerzyCZ: Every class is harder at higher ratings
[6:17:58] DirtyYankee0: yep pre everything, pre blur, meta pre, glimpse
[6:18:13] mouro52: Imho UHDK has a very low skill floor atm, am i wrong?
[6:18:34] armin_ed: Will cdew switch to hpally?
[6:18:39] GerzyCZ: Unholy used to be harder
[6:18:39] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[6:18:49] Itankarenas: cdew doesnt even play hpal does he?
[6:18:53] Itankarenas: never seen him play it
[6:19:07] avenueone: i think dew did a bit in slands?
[6:19:15] kzloxxx: @Itankarenas he does if needed
[6:19:16] Cybernytez: bru i played 2s on hpal today, i got trained by Dh or WWs at least in 5 games and i died so fast even fakecasting i had ZERO chance
[6:19:16] kzloxxx: but hates it
[6:19:21] Itankarenas: ah, wasnt watching back then
[6:19:21] Frostyjoneslol: cdew plays hpal as needed
[6:19:31] happyheals: Entangling bark gonna be good again
[6:19:52] DirtyYankee0: yeah too drastic
[6:20:11] Frostyjoneslol: unholy dk has super low skill level its dumb. Even train CC, root, snare slowing top damage is deathcoil a ranged ability
[6:20:20] lockxdots: it's literally just giving us Demon Armor buff back...nothing new
[6:20:27] avenueone: yea but dinner might be soon
[6:20:40] avenueone: ye
[6:20:44] happyheals: I am around if ytou need a filler
[6:20:47] lockxdots: they nerfed the buff of demon armor
[6:20:47] avenueone: will only b 10
[6:20:57] happyheals: I am FM
[6:21:26] happyheals: I am a freakin Moderator
[6:22:04] kzloxxx: @Itankarenas I think he hates hpala and mistweav
[6:22:09] kzloxxx: not sure
[6:22:20] Itankarenas: @kzloxxx yeah, that's what he's said I'm pretty sure
[6:22:30] Itankarenas: I know he hates monk
[6:23:51] happyheals: who?
[6:24:07] kzloxxx: cdew
[6:24:47] meltwarr: Mez have you seen Deez ?
[6:25:02] Itankarenas: @meltwarr bruh... you gotta try hard than that
[6:25:05] happyheals: yeah he dislikes the play of rdruid and monk and not huge on hpal, but he did have to play that for a long tiome
[6:25:14] meltwarr: @itankarenas nah too lazy
[6:25:17] happyheals: from what I gathered
[6:27:16] kzloxxx: holy fuck

[8:11:26] Felizzpe: yea 10%
[8:11:31] Fliigh7z: more locks are coming

[9:13:29] happyheals: dawson is your toon ally or horde?
[9:13:31] e1im: epic plate gloves from the dreamwardens vendor
[9:13:34] happyheals: for the quest
[9:13:44] dawsonator171: horde
[9:13:44] happyheals: oh you only ally
[9:13:50] happyheals: oh nvm ave does
[9:14:20] dawsonator171: I tossed ken's evoker the quest that gives the buff for superblooms.
[9:14:21] happyheals: I have chanters and crafters on horde, lemme see what is cheap
[9:14:49] dawsonator171: im done with it all happy
[9:14:56] happyheals: your toon needs to de 10-12 items?
[9:15:00] happyheals: oh im sorry
[9:15:18] dawsonator171: you can literally pick up the professions and not have to make the crafting orders for the items when you to get those parts.
[9:15:27] happyheals: ght I had a rare chance to help before you started the end of episode monologue
[9:15:42] dawsonator171: brett is sitting on a buff for one of your toons.
[9:15:48] dawsonator171: makes super bloom farming much faster
[9:16:25] happyheals: yeah I got hyped and did a heroic at 407ilvl
[9:16:38] happyheals: 407 lol
[9:16:54] happyheals: I died every fight lol
[9:17:35] afriKENx: is that like a 1/4 at the least then?
[9:17:42] afriKENx: i thought heroic added like 10% to blp
[9:18:06] happyheals: I have no idea, but I think my ret will be what I do it on
[9:18:44] happyheals: hehe people owe favors so I cashed one in
[9:18:54] happyheals: and got hared carried
[9:19:01] DOGGFOOD69: Hey mes what are your taugth on the new pvp changes
[9:19:01] dawsonator171: I did notice that the legendary can be used as a gap closer from about 15-20 yards. which is kind of nice utility.
[9:19:08] DOGGFOOD69: ret is going to be the best melee
[9:19:12] happyheals: we can make a full clear group
[9:19:20] dawsonator171: I did use it once while nova'd and I moved, but I do not know if the nova happened first.
[9:19:32] DOGGFOOD69: with dh
[9:19:50] sngtokos: @notmes how fucked is dk on reset?
[9:20:02] happyheals: dk is better at reset
[9:20:27] dawsonator171: yeah.
[9:20:30] fiends_church: Who is the best rog in the west?
[9:20:35] dawsonator171: it has a charge effect.

[9:22:42] yngvarrthebeast: it's super good
[9:22:48] yngvarrthebeast: beem*
[9:22:58] ImHomegr0wn: it's a higher ST focus spec. mvq goes between the two
[9:23:05] yngvarrthebeast: it's just better at solo dps
[9:23:06] ImHomegr0wn: still plays the old one
[9:23:10] happyheals: depending on how you look at the necrotic aura going to 3% from 4%. Yoiu have to take into account that overall hp is going up.
[9:23:12] Fliigh7z: why dont you need fire inside
[9:23:44] winter__x: you do
[9:23:49] winter__x: go into looks for kill
[9:23:55] yngvarrthebeast: but don't need telent on 6% crit aura
[9:24:05] yngvarrthebeast: it's useless without crit dmg tal
[9:25:02] Fliigh7z: why do people not take fire inside anymore?
[9:25:39] dawsonator171: extremely fine.
[9:26:13] dawsonator171: it's got similarities to the raid ST build
[9:26:14] happyheals: boomy partner gives 12% spell crit
[9:26:23] dawsonator171: Bedge have a good night.
[9:26:48] yngvarrthebeast: after enter demon form ur next fel strike will do big dmg , also ur beem with cdr is 20 sec cd only +-
[9:27:26] MistrJ__: hey mes do you have an addon or weakaura for arena 1,2,3 on  unit frames / nameplates

[9:32:27] Fliigh7z: so might be worth
[9:33:36] Fliigh7z: fire inside gotta be better than inferno
[9:33:43] Fliigh7z: yea
[9:35:23] Fliigh7z: it will be cooler if it lines up with essence break
[9:35:30] Fliigh7z: perfectly

[9:38:36] waitimdesyncd: DHs run wild on ladder: Fine DKs run wild on ladder: oh wait thats overperforming! - blizzard probably
[9:38:51] happyheals: I was wondering what funk nasty things you did to be a purple rogue
[9:39:08] waitimdesyncd: It feels like only Dhs get to overperform D:
[9:39:48] waitimdesyncd: Prayge its utter shit Kappa
[9:39:54] happyheals: dh dk rdruid is prob gonna be pretty strong'
[9:40:04] Fliigh7z: does seem kind of overtuned
[9:40:17] Fliigh7z: cycle of hatred should be 1.5 instead of 2
[9:40:38] Fliigh7z: 0.5 sorry
[9:40:42] Fliigh7z: instead of 1
[9:42:09] Fliigh7z: a 1 second cd reduction by doing your rotation on an insane damage ability on a 30 second seems nuts
[9:42:25] Fliigh7z: like dhs defintely seem tuned on a 30 second eyebeam
[9:43:09] Fliigh7z: dh dk is nuts rn
[9:43:16] Fliigh7z: my dh friend wants me to level a dh
[9:43:32] happyheals: Our old Freehold boosting build gave us eye beam spam
[9:43:51] Fliigh7z: oh wait im dumb as rocks lmao
[9:44:03] waitimdesyncd: Off topic, but I meant frostgodXEEK on EU last night. He was using guild charter to invite  people so he could make a guild on EU. And randomly I walked by and was like "xeekamerica" is that really xeek? and it was
[9:45:03] Fliigh7z: the beat dropped perfectly when you switched druid there
[9:47:18] happyheals: you need that Excision Harambe set to start droppin
[9:48:09] armin_ed: Just doing double the dmg of the hunter
[9:49:15] happyheals: pretty much feel like any melee can pair with druid dh
[9:49:22] Fliigh7z: @armin_ed some of it is pad but yea this build seems nuts
[9:49:25] happyheals: feels*
[9:49:38] armin_ed: @Fliigh7z true
[9:50:11] Fliigh7z: how much damage is immo doing without fire inside or inferno?
[9:50:37] TactiTortoise: What changed in this build?
[9:50:37] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
