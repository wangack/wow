[4:12:39] LoLOkanak: bfa was good , but the problem was the unbearable neck grind
[4:12:48] ChilleGG: I think its hard to argue that BFA was awful for anyone returning to the game in late patches, had months of grinding to become a viable character
[4:12:53] Derca_: i think some people got jaded by legion, so they thought bfa was bad

[4:13:29] PvtHudson093: I want the mission table back

[4:13:56] vitloggg: @The_Boctor pvp?
[4:14:00] NickLeonhearth: BFA 1.0 sucked but 2.0 and the last patch with corruption was fun AF
[4:14:22] Elijahss: Dragon Flight is my favorite expansion

[4:15:10] snake_like: balance corruptions, put them on a vendor day one, make essences account wide, tweak azerite armor and BFA is the GOAT

[4:15:38] Whiskey_Corin: THD was right. Bring back AP
[4:15:42] caboose1029: BFA is 2nd or 3rd best Xpac

[4:15:45] JQ47: I'm sad I missed corruptions
[4:15:48] adxx: I did not like the amount of RNG for the corruption gear pieces. I had to wait like 6 weeks worth of M+ to get twilight Dev it sucked

[5:01:20] WaverlyP15: yeah grevious and quaking are the worst,  snaguine wouldve been nice to be gone but its no where near as annoying as those two
[5:01:23] shomeurcrits: Sanguine is so easy to deal with tho as long as you have a decent tank that puts it in a decent area
[5:01:32] hammack52: i want pride full and reaping as weekly affixes
[5:01:36] kimmo_gaming: new affix, fantasticating, when dealing damage get infused with fantasticness lol
[5:01:42] ShadesOBlue: Affixes are the new Artifact Power, we're stuck with it, and they should all go
[5:01:55] daconcion: I feel like Thundering was a beneficial affix. Annoying at times, but 30% dmg/healing is good

[5:01:56] BlueBlurPrime: rumbling ruby not a good trink imo
[5:02:00] Yurian33: you must not pug much... getting people to interupt or dispel is pretty near impossible
[5:02:07] WaverlyP15: yeah its BIS for M+ for pally, but idk
[5:02:08] Sollice: Morning everyone
[5:02:13] Molvonos: Ayoo
[5:02:28] vic_ave: if you are saying he don't pug you must be new here
[5:02:33] TexValhalla: for real you seen some of the raids and m+ he does? LUL
[5:02:45] shomeurcrits: @daconcion thundering wasn’t bad but the benefit of the buff was puny compared to like pride in season 1 of shadowlands where it was like a 40second buff
[5:02:48] mrrazputin: You dont pug... You ask your stream to get in the grupe and pick only the top dogs
[5:02:50] jhajden: but you dont have to pug tanks Kappa
[5:02:53] Thoreya: keep in mind theres only 3 affixes now too
[5:02:54] Molvonos: ....
[5:03:02] Molvonos: @mrrazputin You're blind and new.
[5:03:08] Thoreya: fort and tyran are wahtever, and then the 2 others like its not that bad lol
[5:03:10] vic_ave: @mrrazputin stop the cap
[5:03:16] largefromage: would you agree your pugs come along with your name and draw more quality players into the run?
[5:03:23] koldar_nemesis: @shomeurcrits not true. Its annoying when a mob dies and the other starts casting. Its easy if youre a dk only
[5:03:25] WaverlyP15: yeah I didnt mind thundering, i thought it was beneficial
[5:03:27] Molvonos: @largefromage Most of his pugs aren't on his Towelliee handle.
[5:03:30] paulson14: i use dungeon slice
[5:03:31] LoseAlotLuke: Hectic add cleave
[5:03:50] WaverlyP15: thundering was only a pain if you had that one dumbass in the group
[5:03:51] vic_ave: i use dungeon slice
[5:03:55] shomeurcrits: That’s a fair point @koldar_nemesis
[5:03:59] TexValhalla: baited
[5:04:22] ninetynil: NotLikeThis

[5:07:04] WaverlyP15: plus its basically a free embbellish

[5:08:45] shomeurcrits: I still have not had weapon or shield drop from my vault 😂 feels bad man
[5:09:05] angahax: Fortified and bolstering

[5:10:05] LoseAlotLuke: I've experienced some gidusgint g
[5:10:09] hammack52: didnt bolstering use to heal the mobs
[5:10:09] shomeurcrits: 😂 mob have 20 stack of bolster
[5:10:16] largefromage: @largefromage right, so anytime a difficult run presents itself or he needs higher caliber player to help complete all need do is name drop not a lot of ppl can do that
[5:10:21] vic_ave: them Seagulls ugh
[5:10:23] Hebrewish012: @Snabido true
[5:10:29] hammack52: i guess im the only person that didnt have a problem with quaking
[5:10:40] shomeurcrits: Turn mobs into raid bosses
[5:10:40] PvtHudson093: Thank god we dont have infested anymore
[5:10:43] Foretoldlegends: Honestly, Greavious didn't need to stack multiple times. One stack was enough to keep a healer on edge.
[5:10:45] koldar_nemesis: still about affixes I think the problem is they can overlap on terrible moments for example you have to stack on 3 boss of AV and thundering or quaking can pop so you have your run runnined by bad RNG not because you did a mistake that sucks
[5:10:53] hammack52: ret pally and hunter
[5:10:55] chippchappi: What wa drama you reffering to?
[5:10:55] lirly__: when it bolstered the crawg boss in UR LUL
[5:11:00] WaverlyP15: mustve only been doing alg
[5:11:05] Devildriver007: Pug tanks not realising its bolster in BFA and kept pulling next packs before others died
[5:11:12] Molvonos: @largefromage For your average pug, which is what he does, no.  Namedropping doesn't do shit.  Otherwise he uses his community, aka the people watching this channel.  Namedrop also means fuck all because it's the streamer.  I don't understand what you're getting at.
[5:11:14] Thoreya: @hammack52 must not play caster
[5:11:16] Foretoldlegends: Greavious can stack more than three times.
[5:11:23] shomeurcrits: @lepan_fan 😂🤣😂
[5:11:38] PvtHudson093: I thought Inspiring was going to come back
[5:11:40] Scarhearth: I didnt mind quaking even playing a healer or mage lol
[5:11:40] WaverlyP15: with a good heal, never worried about it
[5:11:47] kajun_predator: @Towelliee need a DPS for keys? 418 DH
[5:11:53] xmedpakx: good day @Towelliee and chat

[5:12:12] WaverlyP15: yeah im literally switching from prot warr, to prot /ret pally next season

[5:25:33] CanadianCataclysm: So by the sounds of it.. its Cross Faction guilds.. which means Cross Realm.. Its NOT CROSS SERVER... unless im wrong
[5:25:57] CanadianCataclysm: Also it seems with no information and based off previous Cross Faction Communities and Guilds.. Its still a 1000 Toon limit
[5:26:07] WaverlyP15: @CanadianCataclysm correct, not CS Cross faction guilds
[5:26:31] WaverlyP15: just cross faction, cross server guilds i dont think will ever happen unless they move to mega servers
[5:26:37] CanadianCataclysm: Which is sad.
[5:26:53] CanadianCataclysm: They should just wait until they get Cross (SERVER) Guilds
[5:27:07] 91Niki: @CanadianCataclysm That's a lot more complicated technology
[5:27:14] WaverlyP15: i think cross faction is a step in that direction however
[5:27:35] WaverlyP15: but cross server is very expensive and complex

[6:31:48] KingSlayerYotam: Hmm it seems a few big names drop from the raid race every tier
[6:31:54] PhoenixAuTv: If their was more money envoled you would see alot more guilds on par with echo honestly. Same for other games too, if you can't make a living off it people don't get involved
[6:31:54] neverbornlucky: Towelliee: Knock Knock. Who is there. Warrior. Warrior who? Warrior aren't you glad they didn't nerf us like the pallies

[6:35:14] Spaede: What’s the alternative though for people that want to do it for a living?
[6:35:17] aeroplax: echo is in better position in this matter, for some EU players if they pay 2000€ a month they are living like kings in their country.
[6:35:20] twinkieruler95: like liquid giving up
[6:35:40] Molvonos: I mean, it's right there anyways
[6:35:53] Red_Dead_Redeem: I'm gonna say it....
[6:35:54] Molvonos: It's not a RWF, It's the Echo Comedy Hour.
[6:36:01] KingSlayerYotam: For me the race wasnt fun to watch since uldir
[6:36:14] Snabido: You dont have people dying to one shots as often so
[6:36:15] ArcaneSyntax: the mop dungeons are undertuned it's great
[6:36:19] kimmo_gaming: if we didnt have guilds like echo and liquid it wouldnt be boring
[6:36:22] PhoenixAuTv: Sucks tho cause this happens in alot of other games too, some of the best players in the world in a certain catorgy just quit have to focus on another career
[6:36:36] NickLeonhearth: Is Echo the old Method guys?
[6:36:47] jkitchin75: thay have a chance till eu goes live
[6:36:54] notshowingface: What keyboard do you use
[6:36:54] FortuneCookie4: Do you think Scholo would be a good M+?
[6:37:05] aeroplax: @NickLeonhearth mostly yeah
[6:38:47] kimmo_gaming: if the guilds like echo and liquid didnt exist RWF wouldnt be boring actually
[6:38:56] mavericks312: what drama/leavers does liquid have?
[6:39:05] castlecastles: echo = cringe
[6:39:16] hammack52: teams on top gennerly wouldnt have roster problems
[6:39:17] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee its like the patriots
[6:39:25] JStevenson: sorry just tuned in....drama in Liquid?
[6:39:29] PhoenixAuTv: @castlecastles ResidentSleeper
[6:40:12] barefax: nothing a good scandal can't fix
[6:40:29] hammack52: @Towelliee is it just recruiting in sports sports that dispersses talent to all the different teams or is there some type of rule that helps with that

[6:42:32] vodkablaq: Damn right I would be the most degeen lol for that monet
[6:42:38] PhoenixAuTv: But i think alot of people compared to before viewing don't care as much, i remember preach talking about lot less viewers of wow these days even tho the games good right now
[6:42:48] PojaLive: @Towelliee they won't do it because they can't release a raid that isn't bugged/unbalanced at launch, it would be too sketchy to put money on an esport that they're balancing in real time

[6:44:36] Exodeo_: Honestly I find the hardcore streams more fun to watch, and I say that as a retail player
[6:44:36] PhoenixAuTv: @aeroplax i think honestly shadowlands caused alot of players to play other games and realise theirs more than wow, so they lost alot of players, thats just my opinion
[6:44:41] TexValhalla: i quit sl though, i just couldn't keep playin that expansion

[6:47:14] TheGiant99: Even the MDI isn't all that exciting to watch really
[6:47:17] Rictamar: the only reason i watch the RWF is for the personalities on commentary, and for me Echo has won that so they get my attention
[6:47:26] UltraKSlaya: Im in your dungeon lol

[6:48:41] trikkle4153: I enjoy doing m+ more than raiding in the game nowadays.
[6:49:06] Shirey36: Mid and retail m+ are just too different
[6:49:16] net_mi: Blizz should make some changes to raid-system and give it some of the functionalities that m+ have
