[0:47:31] Moobot: @Sintry123 Today's casters are Doa, Naguura, Meeix, Dratnos, Tettles, and Xyronic

[0:47:38] screwdrivera: SpOoodOOders
[0:47:39] JStevenson: why is it saying "commercial break in progress"?
[0:47:43] sharpps: 3 chesting comes from Legion where +3 gave 3 lootchests
[0:47:46] Thatguy8795: Its called three chesting because there used to be extra chests per breakpoint, they consolidated the loot into just the same chest
[0:47:55] bendermannen: what ya pushin bud!?!

[0:47:56] moderatygos: the original iteration of m+ did reward more loot by giving you more chests the better you did up to 3 chests. that system was changed, so you get the one chest and same loot regardless of how fast you do the key
[0:48:05] Meeix: @JStevenson thats a twitch sided thing
[0:48:27] GuardMoony: @omniscientautoma might want to make a bot command for that :D
[0:48:34] VibingLovely: So "3 chesting" means "They are doing high keys"
[0:48:37] skilled_fragi: @warcraft is it possible to show overall dmg of each class after run is over ?

[0:49:30] Liryns: 😺🚩MONKA 🚩😺
[0:49:36] moderatygos: 3 chest is the same thing as if they +3 the key
[0:49:36] mibbio: @Blackgoose25 was never gone. not all WoW Content ist exclusive on Youtube
[0:49:48] Cerms: @vibinglovely based on the timer that you can see on the top left of each screen, large bar is 3 chest, middle bar is 2 chest, right bar is 1 chest.
[0:49:58] picc0: @vibinglovely they are skipping 2 additional runs by 3 chesting, as in 3chesting a 24 gives you a 27 key instead of a 25 or 26 which saves a lot of time

[0:51:38] Sumirina: @vibinglovely there's this bar on the left, showing how much time they have left. if they don't make the timer they have to go again, if they make the timer but barely, they go one level higher (stuff does more damage and has more health), and then there are two other breakpoints (the bars on the timer thingy), so when they are going really fast they can up the dungeon by 2 levels or 3 levels respectively

[2:21:14] Lokitoki81: how about taking a 2-chest....
[2:21:15] goop: he had to use PI for that res lmao
[2:21:30] Creoxx: ^
[2:21:41] Thedragonsenpai: they will 3 chest still
[2:21:43] royalprox: why that so much matters either 2 or 3 chests (+2 or +3 key upgrade?) more points?
[2:21:46] Meeix: @Ellesmere_Gaming what was the wlportal for if he was waiting on the shape tho meeixThink im so confused still
[2:21:58] HEADSHOZ_CS: why is the message banned what bad thing did i say?
[2:22:07] Shalodar: At least these failed skips don't only happen in my derpy group... LUL
[2:22:17] eclip468: using pi for that mass was smart
[2:22:20] royalprox: why that so much matters either 2 or 3 chests (+2 or +3 key upgrade?) more points?
[2:22:22] Swgam12: @royalprox you can skip a key level. three chesting a 24 allows you to go straight to a 27. if you two chest you can only go to a 26
[2:22:25] Ellesmere_Gaming: @Ellesmere_Gaming im gonna go back and check cuz yeah that was strange.
[2:22:35] Meeix: @royalprox they want to go as high as possible with these, so if a team 3 chests all of their dungeons and another only 1chests they the team that 3-chests will be a lot quicker to go high up
[2:22:35] chubahi: @Ryunar_  Thats what i was thinking LUL
[2:22:40] Lokitoki81: 4 dungeons in 5 hrs is abit rough... there is not much time to do more runs per dungeon
[2:22:48] picc0: @royalprox it saves a lot of time

[2:24:41] Shearin77: @Radsol54 no point in 3 chesting it since it's capped at 35

[2:40:56] Radsol54: its a fire mage thing
[2:40:56] Bruxe3: @Slaughterotic Fire mages jump during combust so they don't accidentally start a hard cast spell, everything should be instant
[2:40:58] keletys: fire mages tend to jump during combustion to avoid accidentally starting a hard cast pyro
[2:40:58] blinkeys: @Slaughterotic to avoid hardcasting pyroblast
[2:41:02] blakexoxoxo: fade is a small DR
[2:41:08] murkhouse: hpriest has fae dr

[2:41:41] ModeraYsera: I knew I left those jumping beans somewhere Stare
[2:41:52] kimohunt: @Slaughterotic range jump cause they just want instant cause (without cast time) specially for fire mage, the combustion window is like spamming 4-5 differents keys and sometime you might mistake start doing a casting pyro without hotstreak. then its dps loss. TLDR jumping make fire mage OP KEKW

[3:49:30] Leeroypaxton: ummm... im NA and i think the wacky EU temp is better
[3:49:31] jenkinsdonuttv: @Havvok801 Jokes aside I prefer C but F is fine, however the outside environment gets so much different at 0C because water freezes and it snows, so makes more sense to me; but that's subjective
[3:49:33] MrZev: Temperature is the only Imperial unit that i am ok with.
[3:49:33] hottoasterr: before the US was born The world's first mechanical clocks are thought to have been tower clocks built in the region spanning northern Italy to southern Germany from around 1270 to 1300 during the renaissance period.

[6:08:26] Meeix: @Meeix i said ONLY nice things about you all day. i will not say nice things about moonkins tho
[6:08:27] StanRaenslen: wouldnt really consider their extra star on junkyard an advantage
[6:08:27] raikoneN_: the gobbamak healingcheck and gunker did look like something that might not be doable for all the teams though
[6:08:28] moderatygos: looking forward to the rest of the weekend for sure

[6:08:33] blort___: @billabong212 no
[6:08:34] nerves1: yeah it's just 1
[6:08:35] stitchtherabbit: Monka is 1 star ahead.. cause their 2 star gives them the 35 which echo has already? right?
[6:08:40] Shonnen: maybe check total time spent as well?
[6:08:45] Unholytree: @Roiben_ Quick question, why'd you guys stack on gunker?
[6:08:49] ModeraYsera: dark horse Stare

[6:09:26] The_Night_Grinder: whats happening with the classic servers

[6:10:32] ModeraYsera: @Reaper_101505 same time, 10 AM Pacific
[6:10:34] Reydien: if you assume echo 2-chests the +27 lower, and monka times the +35 junkyard at the same time, then it'd turn into a 1-level advantage for monka
[6:10:42] cynricsaxon: make them play un-nerfed lower kara
