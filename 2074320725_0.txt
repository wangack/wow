[0:06:24] frazlord: We pulled the trigger on a cleaning service every couple weeks and it's a game changer.
[0:07:39] incro_: the deaths in that show are wild
[0:10:31] frazlord: Yep. 2 kids under 4 and a long haired dog.
[0:10:48] frazlord: Instead of spending a few hours on a weekend to clean, more family time.
[0:11:07] WytherOK: I brought in cleaners just to clean my bathrooms
[0:11:21] WytherOK: that’s some shit i never think about
[0:13:28] Tharayel: i sold my 3 bedroom apt and moved to a 1bed, god damn, its better now...
[0:13:32] Sm3xRS: dude... my cat sheds so much i wonder every day how the fuck he isnt bald already

[0:20:12] lowincomehooker: 5mil gold and worried about those flask prices? :eyes:
[0:20:31] FinestGoldy: by making smart purchases
[0:21:22] Yosty: the real fuckers this xpac are crafters who want 15k to click a button RAGEY
[0:21:39] Guffels: if its just clicking a button do it yourself :)
[0:21:48] lowincomehooker: I mean I agree but idk games fairly cheap to play I just buy wow tokens with my gold :3 working AH is meh with all the bots
[0:21:50] Yosty: I do do it myself :)
[0:21:59] numnumss: any advice for an up an coming bdk getting into high keys?
[0:22:07] stuhmpytv: are servers back up?
[0:22:17] Guffels: sounds like you arent making money then. i made a couple mil on weapon crafting in season 1 clicking buttons lol
[0:22:34] TyHeals: Let me send public crafts for specific rank xD
[0:22:57] Guffels: I think rank 5 should be able to be guaranteed at this point in the expansion.
[0:23:34] WytherOK: i mean you could have all done crafting this expansion 4Head
[0:23:40] midget_banana: Sad how i missed the stream yesterday with actually good games but was there for job to talk about nobility penis
[0:23:40] thepanoramiks: That is what guildmates are for
[0:23:59] thepanoramiks: People wanted 50k for gem, instant block list
[0:24:41] WytherOK: the main issue was making it rng
[0:24:47] Yosty: Its just an oversight it'll be fine next xpac
[0:25:11] Korupcija_: most crafters are bots
[0:25:34] WytherOK: literally just described me at work zubBLIGHT
[0:25:36] Korupcija_: I see same 3 people spam all day KEKW
[0:25:57] theskot: they get 10k per craft i wonder how much they make
[0:27:15] nibaw_: YEP
[0:27:26] WytherOK: I would usually just watch for someone saying “lf lw” or whatever profession
[0:27:41] Prycey: another thing I hate with crafting is say blacksmithing having to go to the fyrakk event just to use a stupid Shadowflame anvil
[0:27:48] thepanoramiks: Get social guild if u are not raider and u get everything done
[0:28:14] TyHeals: Give us a catch up system for knowledge as well...
[0:28:35] WytherOK: i also had an addon that blocked those spam messages
[0:28:39] Adrang: The only issue with that is the cap on public orders
[0:28:52] Prycey: @Adrang remove the cap easy
[0:28:52] thepanoramiks: @TyHeals Trade from main to alts, i have liek 500 knowledge sitting on main for no reason
[0:29:11] Korupcija_: it works in guilds though
[0:29:17] Not_aFox: KEKW
[0:29:24] calaim: the intro to the crafting system literally has you do all that shit, lol
[0:29:28] thepanoramiks: @TyHeals But make it tradeable after u unlock it to max so people dont do 20 alts for main
[0:29:30] dizorid: lmao
[0:29:34] Korupcija_: ye, play classic if you want to talk to people Madge
[0:29:37] stuhmpytv: system dumb af
[0:29:41] WytherOK: I actually made an m+ group through crafting for them
[0:29:45] stuhmpytv: the Lego loot system is even dumber
[0:29:46] Guffels: i actually do have a good relationship with the lariat crafter on our server lol. hes a cool dude
[0:29:55] Yosty: The sytem is almost great thats whats annoying about it
[0:29:55] stuhmpytv: yo are servers back up btw
[0:29:59] Adrang: @Prycey it is, but it speaks to a larger problem borne of lack of crafters capable because of hte work it takes to max profs now
[0:30:10] Tauzzu: @Korupcija_ in our guild it doesnt work because ppl are giving you 100g for guarantee r5
[0:30:22] theskot: i hear some recipes are still rare even at this point
[0:30:24] numnumss: is elvui ever in date
[0:30:27] theskot: lariat or whatever
[0:30:32] DoubleProGG: did you have a group to play live keys with ?  or am i mistakne there ?
[0:30:47] Korupcija_: @Tauzzu that's crazy, I only get 69g
[0:31:02] lowincomehooker: It's a free week what you mean??
[0:31:08] Tauzzu: @theskot lariat at silvermoon-eu (biggest eu realm) lariat recipe is 3m gold
[0:31:09] numnumss: how do you prevent a bdk from getting 1 shot from trash in 27s?
[0:31:13] Prycey: also the fact that to craft certain items you need to go to say brackenhide for leatherworking or the fyrakk event for blacksmithing is dogshite
[0:31:55] frozenheartsqt: Yo Bolstering is insane on fort... Was bricking 23 - 24s a lot this week Sadge
[0:32:19] theskot: @Tauzzu good lord lol
[0:32:40] WytherOK: Prycey that was a huge drain on the crafting, having to save a bracken lockout just to go make boots ResidentSleeper
[0:33:07] WytherOK: or dropping a 10k cauldron?
[0:33:41] Mattyuh: I have an alt on a small, small server to play with my brother and there is 1 person on the server that crafts everything. Takes hours and hours to get a ring craft
[0:33:45] TyHeals: I just want them to let me get catch up knowledge on all my alts I didn't do weekly profession shit on
[0:33:56] thegreatdestroyer27607: def a good start but needs some work for sure
[0:33:57] flawlesslykun: YEP
[0:33:58] flawlesslykun: YEP 󠀀
[0:34:00] flawlesslykun: YEP
[0:34:02] thegreatdestroyer27607: good bones as they say
[0:34:04] Guffels: I think it was a good first iteration of the system. I like having the ability to craft gear
[0:34:38] goesidd: Rpg on AD and MG
[0:35:01] Prycey: WoW hasn't been a rpg since like wrath LUL
[0:35:09] Mattyuh: according to the egirl take over on my twitter, wow is now a dress up game for your characters
[0:35:51] theBroHam: Tmog is very popular among casual women players
[0:36:13] WytherOK: canada has migration restrictions monkaS
[0:36:16] Bear: Bear subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! I've pulled myself away from spreadsheets to tell you that I'm proud of you and wishing you an amazing day JB
[0:36:47] Prycey: if you want an MMORPG go play classic or FFXIV
[0:37:16] eazye503: Does it work to put a range into the search bar?
[0:37:18] Bear: sry didn't means to interrupt. didn't have audio on yet.
[0:37:23] kwizzzz: crafting left the mmo space for the survival genre
[0:37:39] goesidd: Crafting is less gear u have to raid for tho
[0:37:47] TyHeals: I miss farming raid materials. Herb/mining is such a waste
[0:38:05] kwizzzz: just let me buy craftables in ah, like legendary precursors in shadowlands, that was fine
[0:38:20] ren0m: Do you miss the RP element Classic had? The "adventure" you had to go through when leveling?
[0:38:53] Prycey: the only reason I leveled any profession is because I aint paying the prices people want fck that
[0:39:09] Mipolol: my response on people asking for 50k for a craft that late into expansion is "HAHAHAHAHA" . I am in many ignore lists YEP
[0:39:11] ren0m: Petopia was and still is here :D
[0:39:18] theskot: there wasnt a vanilla wow dps sim for your gear lol
[0:39:36] Bear: The audacity of people demanding high level tips when you're providing all the mats is beyond me. Outside of Brackenhide Hollow crafting I just don't get it.
[0:39:44] CyonDru: @ren0m i dont think this would ever happen again for anyone who has played wow
[0:40:07] CyonDru: closest you could possibly get if some banger mmo popped up but then again we have access to so much more in todays age, nothing is truly a surprise anymore
[0:40:18] AndyMud: Thott the man/myth/legend miss the Afterlife homies
[0:40:20] thegreatdestroyer27607: server forums were a thing
[0:40:26] Mattyuh: i miss when people would follow me across the main city because they had never seen T3 gear before
[0:40:40] eazye503: @bear  Usually its just if they have to use an insight since mettle is a limited resources for them so they charge for it
[0:40:42] kwizzzz: being a big shot on your server in vanilla was a good feeling
[0:40:47] CyonDru: exactly
[0:41:24] Mattyuh: @kwizzzz i have scarab lord and would get like 100 people following me, now when i hop on the mount no on cares. i need attentionnnn lmao
[0:41:38] Arvakr: dont worry in 2035 the riot mmo will be out
[0:41:39] Prycey: @eazye503 they should be swimming in mettle at this point I have so much I don't know what to do with it LUL
[0:41:48] Bear: @eazye503 but demanding 10k for a max level 463 ilvl item when you're working on an alt feels off. But you make a fair point.
[0:42:08] Whitewolf1441: same
[0:42:15] ren0m: @CyonDru Well, as JB said, there's classic :D But I doubt they'll add it to retail

[0:42:34] CyonDru: classic isnt classic anymore @ren0m that game is ruined
[0:42:39] Bear: 100% JB, being bad isn't fun.
[0:42:59] CyonDru: the game is solved it is not the game ppl remember anymore
[0:43:00] certified86: people want season of DISCOVERS
[0:43:07] ren0m: Well, ye. For those who played it back in the day, it's not the same. I have no idea how what new people feel about it @CyonDru
[0:43:12] eazye503: @bear yeah definitely. I usually have friends do crafts but I know exactly what you need an insight for so I tip for that. It is super unfortunate to not be able to find someone to craft for you when its super expensive
[0:43:17] CyonDru: @Mattyuh i persoanlly never found that title particuarly impressive lol
[0:43:19] nppp: I am charging 2k for no insight, 3k for insight, 5k for bracken.. Am I too cheap actually? lmaoo

[0:43:36] menzlo: Imagine playing chess without learning openings
[0:43:38] eazye503: @nppp if you’re on a big server then prob yeah
[0:43:38] CyonDru: @certified86 lmfao exactly
[0:43:40] Whitewolf1441: but with education theres no way you could figure out how many planets there are xD
[0:43:52] lordbeedril: see being bad at a game is not fun I’ll give you that, but just watching a video or 50 to be told how to min/max is also not fun
[0:44:37] certified86: wow players are also not 12 years old and have the whole day to play
[0:44:40] Whitewolf1441: yeah theres enjoyment in figuring things out, especially if no one else depends on you
[0:45:09] eazye503: I used to work in geophysics research and figuring things out was super fun because you know that there’s not some answer out there and you’re committed to it
[0:45:11] CyonDru: someone will find soemthing before you and then share it, just how it is today
[0:45:26] CyonDru: wow isn't alone on this
[0:46:06] theskot: its still not min maxed instantly in sod, it takes a few weeks after the phase drops for people to decide on gear lists and specs
[0:46:23] eazye503: min max is a lifestyle
[0:46:28] certified86: i'm just looking forward to the war within while having dungeon and raid guides 1 month before the game comes out. discovering things really isn't for the regular player anymore
[0:47:17] kwizzzz: i'm currently in the process of buying a fast road bike, the amount of shit you can research is insane
[0:47:21] Whitewolf1441: but this is actually reasonable
[0:47:33] goesidd: + - yellow pad
[0:47:35] Whitewolf1441: guide xD
[0:47:38] ren0m: So about that monitor?
[0:47:42] CyonDru: I need a guide on minmaxing my oven
[0:47:45] theBroHam: anything over $100 I look shit up online first
[0:47:51] CyonDru: Clueless
[0:48:01] Mattyuh: i bought a new oven like 3 weeks ago, i know this struggle
[0:48:04] dwinchh: Consumer reports?
[0:48:09] eazye503: Watch twitch clips of the oven MDI to see which is the fastest
[0:48:25] Fortvila: i envy those people
[0:48:47] MasterNewt: My GF buys shit by googling the thing she wants to buy and then clicks Images. So yeah ...
[0:49:01] ren0m: I want to play WoW, warrior is the first class, so I picked it :P
[0:49:03] Whitewolf1441: i feel like its reasonable to spend time considering something so expensive, but with games it takes the fun out of it kinda
[0:49:09] Mattyuh: $30 more could be a built in air fryer and a 1cu bigger oven and you lose wifi connection
[0:49:14] Arvakr: so what oven did u get
[0:49:35] WytherOK: I wonder if I could talk my wife into moving to Malaysia
[0:49:38] AndyMud: the "ill google it" generation
[0:49:43] eazye503: JB what are the specs on your new oven?
[0:49:48] Whitewolf1441: @WytherOK malaysia is incredible
[0:49:58] prsco_: i'm the same , sometimes it takes me so much time to choose.
[0:50:18] WytherOK: we've been joking about moving out of the us, but it's getting closer to me actually wanting to do so

[0:50:37] Orgabism: That can also be an illusion :)
[0:50:42] GoodyGodfather: I felt that, also Good Morning JB
[0:51:09] AndyMud: also happens because we can no longer trust greedy coporations like back in the day, ovens would last 50 years now 10
[0:51:14] Whitewolf1441: haha
[0:51:22] biggchunguss_: lol
[0:51:42] eazye503: You wanted to be included
[0:52:16] Whitewolf1441: examples of how it served you well?
[0:52:18] Mattyuh: my girl found the same oven i wanted at a scratch and dent place for 60% of the cost. just had a dent on the side that didnt harm anything
[0:52:23] eazye503: new to the stream, is that your wife?
[0:52:43] Whitewolf1441: @WytherOK whats wrong with the us?
[0:53:50] WytherOK: the education system leaves something to be desired and I don't believe in private education
[0:54:09] GoodyGodfather: what did you think of MDI this weekend?
[0:54:37] eazye503: My wife and I are both public school teachers but will for sure send our kids to private school. We want the system to change but do not want out kids to suffer while it is in the process of changing @wytherok
[0:54:42] nickis211: I LOVE BELATRO
[0:54:51] Mahmutti: i grew up pretty poor, and now that i'm making a decent amount of money i still find myself thinking over purchases that are like a tiny part of my disposable income
[0:55:18] Mattyuh: @WytherOK as someone that went to public school in the US and in Norway, there really wasnt much of a difference
[0:55:55] WytherOK: eazye503 my parents were both teachers and they were asking me about the educations vouchers texas is debating atm
[0:56:18] theBroHam: I went to private schools since my parents didn't want me to go to inner-city school districts. We used the voucher program available here to save money
[0:56:22] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:56:34] WytherOK: both our education and healthcare need some actual change
[0:56:43] eazye503: @wytherok My understanding of that system is that it will unintentionally GUT public schools. People will most often choose private > public
[0:57:19] WytherOK: you say unintentionally, but I do believe that is a major drive
[0:57:33] GoodyGodfather: Nah not at all, BUT THATS A GOOD DEAL
[0:57:53] eazye503: I feel like a million bucks when I get a good deal
[0:57:56] WytherOK: there are politicians here that have that as a major part of the beliefs/platform
[0:58:58] eazye503: JB do you do a “real job”? You said you went to law school?
[0:59:11] nickis211: lets gooooo

[0:59:43] Korupcija_: surely you can kill 2 bosses in 4 hours Aware
[0:59:53] eazye503: lol thats why I put it in quotes - Most would say it isn’t but I think it is
[1:00:05] WytherOK: he's working harder than I am and I'm in healthcare
[1:00:25] eazye503: I should have said “traditional job” - my b

[1:01:08] Mattyuh: @TrevorSaurusrex13 content creation is a very large job now and should be a normal thing

[1:06:05] rosina_scarlett: nah the boomie went resto after Rezan
[1:06:10] flowerpwrxd: @stryped link to vod?

[1:06:34] GoodyGodfather: Holy shit streamelements working today?
[1:06:35] TrevorSaurusrex13: i imagine the idea for skipping first is the hope that people are fresh so you do the end first as opposed to doing all the other bosses and try for tindral/fyrakk at the end

[1:11:02] WytherOK: they are both deck games, but the play style is pretty different
[1:11:44] eazye503: Ok sick thanks for explaining that! Excited to see it
