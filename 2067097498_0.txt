[1:46:48] Olmoscheeks: I’m more offended by her keyboard squeaking on the desk
[1:46:53] CabinetMistake: did you see that whaaz SS game earlier where zeepye cast 3 cyclones and 3 wraths and let him dye because his frames were messed up?
[1:47:00] blueflagger: I'm not into fake stuff
[1:47:02] CabinetMistake: funniest clip
[1:47:04] Doomsday_Sama: A guy should put on the same bikini and do the same thing and see if he gets banned to prove bias from twitch
[1:47:13] foxyllama: worst part is shes playing heal/exhaust and no flash
[1:47:15] whitewallss: @nikthevoker im easily distracted

[1:48:57] cerren: LMFAO
[1:49:45] Gumjob69: sick mog wheres it from
[1:49:47] blueflagger: Twitch isn't dying. People are paying for sexual content

[1:49:54] foxyllama: twitch cant die the hot tub section is popping off Kreygasm
[1:49:55] Dourme: Well amazon is losing money on twitch apparently
[1:49:57] Aktiive: jynxi has 100k viewers atm but its dying kekw
[1:50:02] kelo__95: Venruki has the most interesting t mogs lol
[1:50:03] Wrathbb1: “I'll be blunt: we aren't profitable at this point,” Clancy said. “Amazon has been extremely supportive of Twitch. Big thing for being sustainable over time is ensuring we don't lose money.
[1:50:10] ItsBees: "Where's it from" "It's my favorite" LUL
[1:50:30] Wrathbb1: yeah thats all i saw
[1:50:31] FateIRL: they are somehow operating at a loss
[1:50:41] Wrathbb1: not crazy to be operating at a loss if its in the plan
[1:50:45] SlyMooseMan: It's not dying but the golden days are just about over for sure
[1:50:50] ItsBees: @Gumjob69 it's from the monthly reward for the Travelers Log thing
[1:50:52] Wrathbb1: but the question is: when do they tip the scale on this curve?
[1:50:55] kelo__95: Twitch is good self advertising for amazon -- doesnt matter if twitch is in the red
[1:51:21] Gumjob69: @ItsBees ait thanks <3
[1:51:25] kheilas: streamers with low viewers cost twitch a lot of money, they've talked about charging people to stream with low viewers
[1:51:44] Wrathbb1: some big companies can use loss leaders but its not as easy as simple as just "we want one bad company"
[1:51:44] CabinetMistake: true lol like WB deleting those 80mil+ production movies as a tax write off
[1:52:10] FateIRL: that would kill new streamers
[1:52:15] FateIRL: nobodys gonna pay to streamt o 2 ppl
[1:52:19] demonic2786: well thatd be one way to kill ur site @kheilas
[1:53:25] Wrathbb1: I think they are still counting on it becoming even bigger, like exponentially bigger in the next few decades. And I really dont think streaming is dying so I bet they are right
[1:53:36] R1_Prototype: probably asking if you wanna join a 3 s team with 3 shamans or something

[2:39:17] beardsellsyyc: well obesity is rampant in north america so yah
[2:39:25] viewsfromct: Amen brother

[2:40:19] Voriq: thats alot
[2:40:19] Luigicamp: tbf England has the highest obesity rate in EU because they carry lots of US fast food joints
[2:40:23] Transparentmirror: It's even units, not even 15%
[2:40:35] squarepusher_: Now what are the definitions for obese in the USA vs the UK?
[2:40:38] SteLawBro: In the next few years Obesity rates will be down at least 50% when food becomes too expensive to buy.
[2:40:50] terranapart: Eat what you want to eat
[2:40:57] PeptoAbysmal: last i checked usa is like the 12th most overweight country

[2:42:53] engzyng: no no look at the dh dps :D
[2:42:56] terranapart: I see the packages as half empty
[2:42:59] Luigicamp: you don't have to look at the numbers though. If I sit outside North Hollywood high school when kids come out at 3pm, it's hard to find a skinny kid.
[2:43:26] healhut: why are you sitting outside a high school bra
[2:43:31] millennialmurphy: ^^

[2:49:29] Nemenon: funny I'm the opposite
[2:49:32] Merkflare: probably makes you win more
[2:49:33] arcane_p: that's because as healer your never waiting all Q's are instant, you actually get to play
[2:49:36] FateIRL: cus you can hop in another lobby insta
[2:49:40] ferahgok: because you can just go again with an insta-que and not have to brood and wait 45mins to try and gain it back

[2:53:14] Voriq: this sham got some crazy kicks
[2:53:55] eceria: Good Ret!
[2:54:21] SteLawBro: Has to be hard to balance high rated games from being all dampeners but people be tanky enough that average healers feel lie they can keep average dps alive.
[2:54:42] Voriq: this guys kicks are so fast
[2:54:51] nikthevoker: ^
[2:54:57] Transparentmirror: botting? monkaHmm
[2:54:57] JustTaki: SUS

[2:57:57] Voriq: Classic
[2:58:04] SteLawBro: Hes either botting or he has such a good understanding of the situation and everyones cooldowns that he knows theres a high probably of you casting and pre sheers the cast. Probably number 2.
[2:58:36] SteLawBro: lol
[2:58:49] JustTaki: gotta pre sheer the penance if you want to hit glad Kappa
[2:59:00] Voriq: Can't find anything on this Glimpse Meld bug

[2:59:04] Voriq: LUL i work tomorrow anyway
[2:59:10] Luigicamp: is it family national day or something?
[2:59:11] Vossie1990: I thought everyone prekicked casts at high rating (1500+)
[2:59:17] gracioussatan: it's presidents day here tmr in US
[2:59:27] inoru_o: yeah it's national

[3:02:07] ThatRandomWhiteKid: old serial killers getting caught now through 23 and me lol
[3:02:09] bones422: police departments between cities at least
[3:02:21] PeptoAbysmal: so they can find you thru family members
[3:02:33] PeptoAbysmal: technically, he wasn't caught
[3:02:39] healhut: or family members through ven
[3:02:49] PeptoAbysmal: but there's theories he was another serial killer lol
[3:02:55] PeptoAbysmal: that's a rabbit hole
[3:02:57] Luigicamp: 70s were nuts. In Italy they had local terrorism, bombing, etc
