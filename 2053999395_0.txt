[0:25:18] Ghostopheles: it starts in NA in 30 minutes
[0:25:25] breninn3: Been farming the blue proto drake everyday for so long.. no drops. Decide to pop and see Malygos and try my luck for his mounts yesterday, got both the Azure and Blue drake in one run..

[0:25:28] Ghostopheles: o/
[0:25:38] NeeK_23: the other achievement, I found the quest wasnt up for me. It was Grizzly Hills. Or is it random per person
[0:25:47] Priory: another week of being hopeful for 10.2.6 news
[0:25:53] breninn3: I've accepted I won't get a single mount drop for the rest of the year now

[0:27:52] OatsMate: aw.

[0:28:15] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL
[0:28:28] nezz231: does the pre quest for love is in the air dailys work for anyone here? she is not in durotar for me

[0:29:31] OatsMate: sometimes it pays to look good. Or "good".
[0:29:39] dright424: they are trying to get gold out of the economy
[0:30:05] NeeK_23: Hell I'm gonna spend 70k for 10 achivo points. Numbers must go up
[0:31:13] NeeK_23: think of it in terms of World Quests, 10k per alt per week
[0:31:44] RAF_Sean: Could do a border of sponsors lol

[0:33:43] grimblade81: What's the event about sorry first time hearing this
[0:33:51] natch_looney: You could run a subathon or donation stream or something specifically for the event as a fundraiser, rather than ticket sales.  You could then get that sponsored or leverage the event sponsors?
[0:34:01] auberji: hostel time
[0:34:02] SlithTheSivak: u might be able to get group rates at a hotel!
[0:34:46] SlithTheSivak: call up a hotel and ask if you can block out rooms at a reduced rate, if they call in and say "we're here for LFG" they get a reduced rate cause ull drive people there
[0:34:46] Ghostopheles: Ghostopheles subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! i hate ads
[0:34:53] NeeK_23: we'll have a whip round, pass a bucket we can toss a fiver into LuL
[0:35:04] natch_looney: Better to raise some cash in advance and donate to charity if you don't need it, than the other way around, imho
[0:35:06] Sennica95: Sennica95 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!

[0:36:37] S3N71: I'll come
[0:36:42] SlithTheSivak: I have to go to fucking Minnesota then...
[0:36:44] CerebrillUK: i plan on it! i'm semi-walking distance
[0:36:46] Layliah79: If i lived in EU
[0:36:47] natch_looney: I'm hoping to be able to make it, sounds great
[0:36:49] NeeK_23: yup
[0:36:54] S3N71: if I can get a ticket on Wednesday that is
[0:37:02] JakeSezz: imma make a damn good shot at it!
[0:37:13] lyreilla: I wish I could go, lol. Would be a mighty bi expense from the US, lol.
[0:37:14] databob1: Would love to but have no money and really bad group anxiety
[0:37:23] JakeSezz: I dunno Dan I think you might be surprised at how many people wanna go
[0:38:07] Valestrus: hi Dan - hi chat! Happy Monday all :D

[0:38:55] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:38:55] Valestrus: the event is such a great idea!
[0:39:01] NeeK_23: if you want help with questions I'm happy to help
[0:39:13] SlithTheSivak: Maybe not a stripper, but Cosplayers are kinda up the same alley...
[0:39:30] natch_looney: How many went to Rage's event in Manchester?
[0:39:33] OatsMate: But it's weird to make DR mount cosmetics so expensive when a bunch of other mounts will have the same functionality in a few months.
[0:39:52] Valestrus: i would be surprised if you dont see the event over subbed @MrGM
[0:40:03] Xesol: drop rate seems excellent as usual
[0:40:59] NeeK_23: first kill on the account of the day is "boosted" chance of drop
[0:41:01] BBMezzy: I hope we do, it's about time we get some proper news again
[0:41:01] Ghostopheles: news? Stare
[0:41:12] Layliah79: people are working. sure it will go up later today
[0:41:19] SlithTheSivak: this isnt one of the best wow holidays...
[0:41:22] Jack_the_Dipper: People are waiting for news
[0:41:26] Layliah79: LOL
[0:41:33] thunder993: Can you check on horde char if event npcs are up for you? People say its bugged for horde
[0:41:35] databob1: I'll watch it soon
[0:42:03] lynscribe: I dont see any of the valentines people in org either
[0:42:05] thunder993: The one that introduces you to vendors
[0:42:17] Layliah79: 2 more hours Dx
[0:42:18] thunder993: The quest npc isnt up
[0:42:27] natch_looney: NA goes live in about 10 mins
[0:42:33] Xesol: they said 10a across regions and i was pumped only to remember i have to wait 3 more hours lol
[0:42:41] Layliah79: 10m? i thought it was 2 more hours.
[0:42:49] Harai_Ulfsark: could it be a phasing issue?
[0:42:51] BBMezzy: That continued 10.2.5 quality
[0:42:55] thunder993: Yep
[0:42:55] NeeK_23: its ok, nobody plays horde
[0:43:12] grimblade81: Na shouldn't be for 2 more hours
[0:43:13] natch_looney: I thought it was 10am server time for NA, if it's PST then it will be later
[0:43:22] Jack_the_Dipper: Manthieus saad it was bugged on Horde side
[0:43:23] physalis4: Give the 2 ppl still working on DF a break LUL
[0:43:34] natch_looney: @grimblade81 damn per0tiPout
[0:43:37] Nimajin: classic
[0:43:43] Harai_Ulfsark: all events are PST time for NA
[0:43:51] Jack_the_Dipper: !Enterr
[0:44:11] Harai_Ulfsark: damn he'll miss the queue
[0:44:23] Jack_the_Dipper: Sadge
[0:44:29] Harai_Ulfsark: the price of washing your hands
[0:44:35] zantos2020: So that's why people miss the queue lol
[0:45:12] physalis4: soo much drama
[0:45:14] Valestrus: the tmog drama?
[0:45:18] Valestrus: oh yh...
[0:45:34] Nimajin: @Valestrus tmog drama?  👀
[0:45:34] JakeSezz: I wasn’t included in any of ‘em, so I don’t wanna talk about it mrgmO mrgmHehe mrgmFine
[0:45:49] physalis4: someone reported Noodle
[0:45:50] Jack_the_Dipper: e-girl wow list something
[0:45:53] Valestrus: @Nimajin you didn't hear?
[0:45:56] lyreilla: Oh yeah, I hear about that. Accolon made a video on it, but I didn't watch it all.
[0:45:57] Valestrus: ITS ALL PINK
[0:45:59] Valestrus: (apparently)
[0:46:00] Valestrus: xD
[0:46:02] Nimajin: oh
[0:46:04] Nimajin: OMEGALUL
[0:46:08] physalis4: sexism I guess
[0:46:19] NeeK_23: guy made a tier list of all wow women on twitter but he asked for consent and he judged them on how much they interacted and if theyre pvpers etc. People not involved got mad and reported him
[0:46:31] Nimajin: @Valestrus oh no we get pink items for the first time, but there's too many !!!
[0:46:32] Valestrus: Accolon?
[0:46:33] magemaster225: it was all HS-clique type drama, some women were mad they werent on it etc.  now theres bad actors making mean spirited tier lists
[0:46:46] Iwony: geez so many roses to buy for transmog Oo
[0:46:46] JakeSezz: Some claimed sexism, some claimed misogyny, some claimed transphobia, some claimed racism. it’s a whole kettle of fish
[0:46:52] Valestrus: @Nimajin xD indeed
[0:47:13] physalis4: Someone made a worse tier list though that wasn't a joke and made the problem worse
[0:47:14] spiceandwolf1216: when do you think 10.2.6 is dropping
[0:47:51] magemaster225: muffinus tweeted to someone that we should probably see him soon
[0:48:12] JakeSezz: @physalis4 yeah that one was just uncalled for
[0:48:19] Ghostopheles: I still think that the announcement was intended for last week and got pushed back
[0:48:40] dright424: I wonder if theres a chance we do not get a 10.2.6 ptr at all
[0:48:48] physalis4: wasn't Holly interacting w/ the pirate tweets?
[0:48:53] magemaster225: holly going into streams was a bit much
[0:49:46] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:50:01] JakeSezz: yep
[0:50:06] dright424: yeah she was in the chat on friday
[0:50:13] physalis4: Everyone should just QT Muffinus w/ a pirate flag
[0:50:17] physalis4: get a movement going
[0:50:34] Promilie: everyone in the know were being so coy and then nothing happened
[0:51:01] Xephur123: I'm not the only one with the interact key pop up EVERYTIME I log in! mrgmHehe
[0:51:07] JakeSezz: I’m kinda fucking over all of it, really. Like, sure, it was kinda cheeky & fun, but it’s like receiving oral and the person stops JUST BEFORE the apex. Not cool
[0:51:10] dragonslay3r_blaz3r: @mrgm how many traders tenders are we supposed to get from filling the bar this month? i got 1000 But it said something about an extra 500 in the bluepost. im confused
[0:51:17] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:51:27] plopptart: people are going to be pissed if it turns out to be a dud
[0:51:34] Layliah79: KEKW
[0:52:08] physalis4: @plopptart Yeah make some popcorn for Twitter that day
[0:52:09] JakeSezz: I’m now convinced it’s a dud. No bullshit
[0:52:09] kermisgirl: no more love charm farm i think there is no box for collecting any charm bracelets during love is in the air
[0:52:19] Promilie: if you hype up a secret too much it will always disappoint
[0:52:25] databob1: There was 200 per completion tier
[0:52:25] chelfx: You 100 from filling the bars and 500 from the chest
[0:52:30] chelfx: 1000*
[0:52:40] Niixten: You can't farm love tokens any more, sadge :(
[0:52:41] NeeK_23: i feel like there's a real danger now that its overhyped and no matter what it is, its been over hyped in their heads already
[0:53:03] death_cam_: love charm kit removed
[0:53:04] thunder993: @mrgm probably horde, so bugged
[0:53:04] magemaster225: used to have a necklace where you could farm mobs for bracelets to turn into tokens
[0:53:13] Nimajin: You could make level 10 monks last year and farm tokens infinitely from boars and such
[0:53:15] Niixten: Lovely Charm Collector's Kit got removed from the vendor that allowed you to farm the braclets
[0:53:21] BBMezzy: It dragged on for too long and now it can only go wrong
[0:53:22] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah love tokens are gone
[0:53:38] s7wede: So annoyed that the horde daily NPC is bugged
[0:53:48] Ghostopheles: no
[0:53:55] NeeK_23: legit people expecting secret raid or player housing and realistically its probably going to be a world event
[0:54:11] plopptart: @physalis4 yuuup; player housing or riot 😅
[0:54:16] JakeSezz: @neek_23 FACTS
[0:54:27] dragonslay3r_blaz3r: @chelfx so if I understand you correctly should have gotten 1500 when opening. not 1000 (since i Havent touched the chest before completting the bar)
[0:54:42] grimblade81: Same
[0:54:43] Nimajin: real
[0:54:54] BBMezzy: A shovel mrgmHehe
[0:54:55] physalis4: Player housing is def not a .6 patch kind of content
[0:55:10] s7wede: Yeah that is just lazy coding. Dreamsurge should be a leaf, timerifts an hourglass and the Big Dig could have been a shovel
[0:55:41] natch_looney: They did it for Fyrakk, where is moves across the map too, don't know why they couldn't have extended that
[0:55:47] Valestrus: i only have 1 chance per day.. only play 1 character.. haha
[0:55:50] Big_Rum: Hello there!
[0:55:57] Valestrus: i can feel i get the heartbreaker this year though
[0:56:01] Valestrus: :P
[0:56:01] BBMezzy: I finished the currency farm on saturday, no more big digs for me.. ever!

[1:18:41] Valestrus: tbf @MrGM  - it is the result of your constructive hardwork.
[1:18:48] Lumimyrsky: The only issue I've ever had with Razer products is that my A, S and D keys seem to scrape off the letters  and I can't find replacements >_>
[1:18:49] Valestrus: just embrace it :)
[1:18:49] DevoidX: anyone have any suggestions for a left-handed gaming mouse? there's a 'ambidextrous' ones but i can't find any left-handed ones :(

[1:19:15] S3N71: Imposter syndrome?
[1:19:46] Lumimyrsky: @DevoidX Pretty sure Razer Naga has a left handed version on their website
[1:20:05] Dunkurk: my razer naga turns 13 years old this year, i stand by razer to the death
[1:20:18] Jack_the_Dipper: Razer own its own side offers left handed mouse
[1:20:22] DevoidX: when i've tried to get a left-handed naga, they've had no stock
[1:20:29] Dunkurk: This is the mouse i got world first garjal with
[1:20:38] Ironhide_Gaming: they dont make very many
[1:20:48] physalis4: It took a while to get use to a mmo mouse, but I was glad I switched
[1:20:53] Jack_the_Dipper: I'm myself lefthanded but I can't handle a lefthanded mouse
[1:20:57] Dunkurk: MoP tier one mogusham vaults 3rd boss

[1:21:57] mrsrockguru: fine thanks
[1:22:01] lowchicken: are archivist wq's bugged? Sometimes i see one on the map but most the time I never see them

[1:22:27] Xesol: i can only see that as being a good thing for the game creators
[1:22:31] nuclearphosphate: possible to talk about that
[1:22:34] physalis4: I've only seen one archavist WQ
[1:22:44] witchhobbit: having exclusives is so bad to me imo
[1:23:00] nuclearphosphate: ok that tunnel portal thing looks sick O.o
[1:23:01] 13lemons: Have you gotten the love rocket previously or will you be farming it this event?
[1:23:01] physalis4: also the unlock to do the Archavist WQ isn't account wide
[1:23:20] nuclearphosphate: no joy on the love rocket today on all 35 characters
[1:23:38] Layliah79: @lowchicken 3 up 1/2 way thru week, then 3 new ones up the last half of the week.
[1:23:46] Valestrus: I do wonder whether they should just give people tokens for each holiday to redeem whatever they want... including the mounts
[1:23:57] Dunkurk: Is it true they've increased the drop rates this year, i gave up on ever getting the mount last year
[1:24:04] Valestrus: like if you have tried it 100 times... SURELY... thats enough
[1:24:07] Valestrus: xD
[1:24:14] lowchicken: @Layliah79 yeah i didn the quest line but I sometimes only see one up a week

[1:32:52] S3N71: Watching another streamer on their phone whilst there should warrant a kick from the event
[1:33:09] physalis4: if ppl are requesting tickets you shouldn't worry about ppl not showing up
[1:33:22] S3N71: Weekly Reset live
[1:33:23] Dunkurk: You could do a bbc style quiz panel with creators that attend

[1:46:34] chelfx: Thye said they called it a leveling raid for reason
[1:46:42] S3N71: I'm hoping to get BFD done and dusted tomorrow evening
[1:46:43] Valestrus: i will be doing BFD >hand in quest wetlands > quest in wetlands
[1:47:27] Valestrus: Only if you intend to do the questing in a less performative area
[1:47:28] S3N71: Swings and roundabouts
[1:47:32] Dunkurk: I dont think a full log of 20 quests will even get you a full level
[1:47:32] LuiBMHunter: how good are you at solo? respawns can be a pain in classic
[1:48:15] Valestrus: think BFD will give you probably 1/4 of a level

[2:04:12] Layliah79: they did @SlithTheSivak ?
[2:04:27] SlithTheSivak: unfortunately
[2:04:29] neverbornlucky: I like telsa cause you can use the vechile you drive as a generator if  the house power goes out
[2:04:34] Neowanderer: there is also some game controverse for it as it has to go thru aple store approval so there may not be many games for it
[2:04:43] Layliah79: hope they don't find that out with DNA in the future.
[2:05:02] DevoidX: only in the EU
[2:05:02] MachoCham: They have to under EU law
[2:05:05] Neowanderer: interesting hadnt heard that

[2:06:12] RosieSeren: windstalker I think

[2:08:03] magemaster225: there was some talk about pilates
[2:08:05] neverbornlucky: I never saw her say anything and I was there lol just that taliesin said you can't go by holly like muffin
[2:08:31] RosieSeren: because she's constantly tweeting things
[2:08:34] neverbornlucky: when it comes to confirmed something being up
[2:08:38] RosieSeren: she's always teasing xD
[2:08:41] Zuldak: Honestly the wow devs are worth following because they post great pet pics
[2:08:44] Dunkurk: Put that on a tshirt
[2:08:47] Layliah79: she loves teasing which gets a lot of hype honestly
[2:09:29] Layliah79: think they would of dropped it sooner if layoffs didn't happen? maybe that was the plan
[2:09:40] Jack_the_Dipper: On 2022/09/29 Blizzard announced the release date of Dragon flight (28-11-2022). 2 months in between. So, if War Within gets rereleased on let's say 28th of Aug, we should hear in June about the release date (in theory)
[2:09:44] neverbornlucky: Taliesin did say if something was delayed it might be related to lay offs
[2:09:46] Zuldak: Yeah ptr would be nice. Right now we got love in the air and some new things to do there
[2:10:57] BBMezzy: What will you choose if 10.2.6 goes up on PTR this week? SoD or PTR?
[2:11:00] Zuldak: It doesn't sound like anyone on the wow team was affected by the layoffs.
[2:11:12] Zuldak: It was ow, diablo and cs that got hammered
[2:11:23] S3N71: The new PvP even looks interesting as well in STV
[2:11:31] S3N71: *event

[2:11:42] lowchicken: @Zuldak i heard the lore team was on reddit
[2:12:13] chelfx: I think we are also due season 4 news
[2:12:14] Neowanderer: there were wow team members were hit but it was mainly art, lore, and cm
[2:12:58] Neowanderer: the austin blizz office is beascially empty now
[2:13:04] physalis4: I was about to be so jealous if you got that mount
