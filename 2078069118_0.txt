[0:11:35] thatguydeew: lol he dropped a level 125 req sword that was unique (0) so no one could loot it XD
[0:11:50] Overbyy: Hot take : There should be a full solo self found mode where dungeons are soloable
[0:11:58] Kazunya_Meowryu: @NotASkiller Just because you can doesnt mean Xar will do it, I think he might only group for instances
[0:12:27] keweiy: so the whole thing was either a big troll (no pun intended) or they just changed the loot tables when they recognized players got conscious and maybe the boss was targeted to be killed for later phases
[0:12:32] killawatts75: Do you actually enjoy the leveling experience to go through it this much or is it more for just content?

[0:42:16] p_fet: @Xaryu its was never supposed to be killed, the xp going up was the devs stalling before they could add troll loot

The description of the item says: Races: Human, Orc, Dwarf, Night Elf, Undead, Gnome, Troll. Those were the races playable during that alpha build. So unfortunatly not available to players, and never have been on live servers.

[1:03:56] flexpeke: Boss spawned right on the streamers to start Kappa
[1:03:57] tr0bs: Some sort of tweaking was done after your last event

[1:04:22] OloCdn: melee got ignored that one attempt and it didn't matter
[1:04:24] JOBLOB: i didnt have any bloods either
[1:04:30] AaahhRealAliens: they probably nerfed him so streamers would finally kill him and would stop lagging all the servers after they realize he doesn’t drop anything…
[1:04:33] geminuspr: There was crazy amount of ppl i. there
[1:04:34] thatdogbitme: Hotfix

[1:08:17] scoutbeans: made it unplayable for others doing the event
[1:08:18] totezmcgoatz_: he starts taking more dmg
[1:08:19] chillingdyylan: Bruised buff
[1:08:19] kboyyyyy: what if killing him lets that secret vendor spawn in STV that sells bengal tiger
[1:08:19] DeathToad007: no nerf they just know the mechanics, dont have lag, and dont have people griefing
[1:08:20] BlackRe3per: @Xaryu bruise stacks
[1:08:21] macjcool: this is what happens when people are nt getting griefd
[1:08:22] bhoffey: dots aren't even doing dmg
[1:08:22] husky907: 800k hp instead of 67 million
[1:08:22] Nomad32: Execute
[1:08:23] XwipedX: there is no lag, he just delays his own heals :)
[1:08:24] TokerTy420: less lag @Xaryu
[1:08:25] plae007: @Xaryu they had to just remove the heal
[1:08:26] Genghish: Look at the dmg numbers of Savix autos on the boss
[1:08:27] YzieGG: we had so much disc too
[1:08:29] Dino__Zaur: @Xaryu did you figured out the mechanics of bruised?
[1:08:30] pieceofstick: YEP
[1:08:32] atlknights7: I was hitting lot harder on him but I had like 9 brused stacks

[1:08:38] TMMOOF: did anyone check the blood vendor after death?
[1:08:40] karl__hungus: i was on a different layer and it died on my layer by ZG during same window
[1:08:40] kboyyyyy: its both

[1:08:42] ARROOCE: @DeathToad007 no lag? are we watching the same stream? LULW
[1:08:43] Genghish: The dmg numbers are juiced too
[1:08:44] GhostblossomYokai: no you just do more dmg when he gets into the 2nd phase I think
[1:08:44] packtar: there was some lag
[1:08:44] hache_esse: boss never got a heal off
[1:08:45] DeathToad007: people are using the mechanics
[1:08:46] flexpeke: 581 white hits non crit, yeah more damage
[1:08:46] Nize2: they were still lagging though

[1:09:00] lHlUlLlK: we did lag but we didnt shut down servers
[1:09:02] macjcool: maybe the glasses let you see the vendor
[1:09:07] Jkfaked: So weird how he drops nothing anyone can use
[1:09:08] DeathToad007: @ARROOCE i mean thats fair but i mean comparitively speaking. no disconnects etc
[1:09:09] twisted_127: u got it to 8% they killed with 10 min left over it was nerfed
[1:09:13] Aldever13: wish i was here
[1:09:26] Saturos47: name backwards is "u mad, cuh???"
[1:09:31] packtar: you can see the lag here
[1:09:34] tr0bs: theres some sort of damage buff as he gets low
[1:09:34] CrixVibez: @Saturos47 lol
[1:09:38] scoutbeans: the lag was awful
[1:09:44] enocchh: people prolly found out that it was killable and started showing up @Xaryu
[1:09:46] bhoffey: it's cause people are layering in to get a free kill
[1:09:47] DeathToad007: there were 0 disconnects tho
[1:09:48] samuxtv: yeah the entire server wanted to be part of world first
[1:09:48] bhoffey: LUL
[1:09:49] pyroflexin: @DeathToad007 i getcha, hard world event lag can mean 30 secs of frozen standing still
[1:09:51] Jkfaked: He drops a weapon you can use in BFA KEKW

[1:09:52] Biggysnipes: holy smokes youre all about that world of warcraft brotha
[1:10:01] scoutbeans: hopefully now that it's been killed people can just do the event again lol i want my mount
[1:10:05] NawtyTyme: FLASH BANG
[1:10:06] DeadFlip: They increased your damage because they anticipated everyone's gear would be EFFED.
[1:10:07] dariusbellpep: how is savix hitting for that much dmg

[1:10:38] Xzanelol: got it
[1:10:41] chillingdyylan: lag got worse as people came
[1:10:42] aSteamedTomato: I think it would lag less if people were forcing less server interactions. Savix moving so much instead of standing and hitting is 10 times as much traffic
[1:10:43] killawatts75: people had so many wild theories with this one world boss it is crazy
[1:10:49] twisted_127: still dropping fast tho

[1:21:46] WordOfJesus: Wait they killed it? fk i was late.
[1:21:46] Ranthyr_: @enocchh I agree. but if you know the problem is the raids then why keep doing it

[1:21:56] glorytoglorzo13: did the tiger drop?
[1:21:57] chillingdyylan: Yeah it didnt heal
[1:22:03] shadowvypers: maybe they wanted him to get downed so people could see he had thing and stopped complaining about server lag

[1:23:07] YzieGG: it was my dps YEP
[1:23:10] tikaski: the heal was enabling griefers so they prob took it out
[1:23:18] Bebe_Rexxar: its funny how this boss originally was meant to punish groups

[1:23:39] Majcurko: WE classic players are well known for our ability to adapt and learn new things :) we just learned the boss, no nerfs needed :)

[1:23:44] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: there is a lot less people now
[1:23:44] Endryx: is the healing due to more people hitting him though?
[1:23:45] resume___: how is savix hitting 1k non-crits as a pally?

[1:23:56] cmilly1025: So level 125 is coming
[1:23:56] devistonia1337: That has to be a drastic nerf unless the blood had something to do with it. Was healing for 15%+ from us, but only 1% there
[1:23:56] plae007: @Xaryu  Just way nerfed heals i'm thinking, they still had griefers, you hear him say " I have 3 living bombs on me" in just a min

[1:26:43] Dano0212: One by Nesingwary and the One in the Arena
[1:26:43] miciahclay: I was in with Sonii last night, I think they might have changed the blood heal thing. Most of us had no blood from the turn in and he was just going down way faster.
[1:26:46] illists: @Xaryu he also dropped the sword and 14g
[1:26:47] mathematician3: They tryin to keep a brotha down. They don't want you to win @Xaryu  it's really simple

[1:27:02] FumblezTV: Polar and Wooddepartment trying to claim they did it first but are just lying lmao
[1:27:03] blackgundam0: @Xaryu all the 'strats' are taking away from the main goal which is doing as much DMG as possible in 30 minutes
[1:27:03] ItsGigabud: I'm guessing location has nothing to do with it. Would be goofy if it did considering his various spawns.
[1:27:04] miciahclay: I think it was really just that we has less people and weren't laggin AS badly or dc'ing
[1:27:05] DatGuyAnton: Anybody know what happened to Jokerd?

[1:28:03] miciahclay: Less lag, and nerfed. It just wasn't healing any more even with no blood.
[1:28:03] ngrett81: definately nerfed
[1:28:03] Bub_Zee: does it say requires lvl 125!?

[1:28:07] M0rley_: copers saying nerfed lol
[1:28:09] kindaopmusic: could hardly respawn sometimes
[1:28:11] jakeo92: So the fact that grieder guilds were busy killing let the other world first kill without the boss getting leeched health

[1:29:52] JEM_GG: maybe in dev
[1:29:55] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Biggerbop they first tried it in a raid group, the boss has a buff that makes him recover to full hp periodically if players are opted from the event and in a raiod group
[1:29:56] citruu: it might just be triggered by seeing it in the loot window by a player running the wowhead client
[1:29:56] packtar: ? what it means

[2:07:44] ketchgg: at least you get vanish
[2:07:47] Adem9x: First try?
[2:07:50] stroobzbeats: would have voted for 'DOESNT DIE'

[2:11:39] thisthingishuge: @deLosse A glitch in a spell is a glitch in a spell. Choosing rogue hardcore, you are asking to vanish out and save yourself. It's not excuse to say "well it bugs sometimes"

[4:05:58] Tovone: guess a day or reset
[4:06:02] cxn_r: I'd love Soul Fragments to tell you what they died to / what date on the tooltip
[4:06:17] r4men_noodle: Unofficial was BIS
[4:06:17] tsetse2fly: No a lot of appeals
[4:06:22] CoolTV: unofficial was hype of hc
[4:06:28] AlexGottsche: Wasn't solo tho
[4:06:33] huckleson: appeal was not abused anywhere as much as people tried making it seem
[4:06:39] bottis96: so im a solo player that has played HC and am playing SOD now I dont think I have the energy to time to do it all again and play self found.
[4:06:40] kboyyyyy: @AlexGottsche ya it was
[4:06:40] grosxek: is is on sod or classic ?
[4:06:43] RealDecon: People could also cheat the addon no?

[4:07:17] cxn_r: @BlueBrit good idea!
[4:07:23] Udenwo: Apparently there was a BLUE post with class tuning in SOD 5 mins ago
[4:07:25] turboer: people could write profane messages on the ground with the death markers if they remain too long?
[4:07:25] AlexGottsche: Group for dungeons > not solo :)
[4:07:25] larw01: @xaryu  you were allowed to duo with the addon though
[4:07:29] buffetbobbie: so is there no auction house at all on this mode?

[4:42:05] handovdoom666: if you die again, your third character should be called "xarsassinalso"
[4:42:08] acee626: they should have made it its own server

[4:42:14] generic1030: what are you eating @Xaryu
[4:42:16] Tavesty: Atleast they waited a couple weeks after P2. Lot of people are raid logging at this point in sod

[4:43:07] gradygauntlet: I like pacing of SF release, cuz its bound to be slower pace, so its easier to follow along while playing as a viewer

[6:06:12] tmacd: does not sound like fun at all
[6:06:14] panzmat: so you're the cause of a few players quitting after we DDoSed the servers!
[6:06:15] TheSward: i fell off a gryphon due to layering at 55 before they gave the immunity buff or w.e
[6:06:15] ripintides: i'd transfer to era and hit 60
[6:06:16] Teokin: @slapshotsd except you are still squishy as fuck and need to facetank things to do damage so you can die from weird shit on one shots
[6:06:17] Troy_G_94: I died 3 times at about lvl 40 to a disconnect and quit
[6:06:18] sankos1990: Xars ass in two can do it! I believe ❤️
[6:06:21] kirk_hunts: As someone who's lost 60s both ways, it oddly feels worse dying to your own mistake than dying to a DC

[6:06:25] Tinman_VF: I died at 42 skinning level 30 turtles to a level 52 elite dragon RIGHT next to SS, i quit

[6:07:06] kaizen421: would rather die to my own mistake to

[6:07:08] Spooferproofn: o shi we're back
[6:07:09] Valanya11: 5 mins on prediction
[6:07:14] kirk_hunts: but being a noob is also pretty tragic
[6:07:15] Valanya11: close it before you pull
[6:07:23] Catalystic_Sudo: yeah I’d rather die too on my own mistake
[6:07:25] Turbosoldier: If you die to a DC, you just transfer your character to a normal realm - put in the appeal in discord, and finish him leveling there...
