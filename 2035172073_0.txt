[1:08:59] hellscythex_: hi :D
[1:09:04] toiletbrushsoup: Dont stand on the same side/next to each other when get dispelled and always the second that hurts the most
[1:09:13] Kaaaaapek: @RynchTV Yea, I know. 100% is... I have Havoc 3200k and spending 1,5h trying get int. As someone said... my key and back and forward with timing and depleteing

[1:12:40] itznashman: think you can take damage from your own if you move during dispel
[1:12:41] TheTenderice: 26+, u dont get value on 23 at all it feels like
[1:12:47] Casee1337: is lariat good with 7 sockel ? and pips mythic or belor nhc ^^
[1:13:35] RynchTV: Tyran 23 youll do 0 add dmg as ignite
[1:13:39] fitsgerald100: music gives me throwbacks to RWF

[1:15:15] Kizmmit: feel like no matter how hard I try I'm losing against them constantly
[1:15:20] Kizmmit: even though I'm pressing 3x the buttons
[1:15:21] RynchTV: Yeah playing ignite makes no sense to you then
[1:15:24] RynchTV: unless you need the prio dmg
[1:15:27] RynchTV: but you wont
[1:15:29] minivan378378: they have alot more burst than you so thats why
[1:15:30] Kizmmit: nah not really
[1:15:45] RynchTV: Just play S2 flamestrike build
[1:16:06] Kizmmit: yeah that's what I have been doing for the most part
[1:16:14] Kaaaaapek: @Kizmmit I have them same but playing low keys with Havoc, Hunter, rouge you will always be in lost position. Play FS till 26?
[1:16:49] itznashman: think you can take damage from your own if you move during dispel

[3:45:49] bingbongsanchez22: boomers pushing m+ love to see it KappaRoss
[3:45:59] MissAvantasia: @Bingbongsanchez Imagine having a heart attack over 400 euro. xD
[3:46:10] hidingi: hidingi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Rice cooking is for rich people
[3:46:20] britishbeef: @Bingbongsanchez in 10 years thats literally what it be
[3:46:28] blakexoxoxo: you eat your rice raw @hidingi ?
[3:46:36] MissAvantasia: Isn'ät anyone in chat having a job? whats going on! xD
[3:46:39] hidingi: No I am filthy rich. See, I can afford prime
[3:46:40] bingbongsanchez22: @missavantasia 😄😄😄😄 how could youuuuuuu guys
[3:46:41] Pchelaa: Hey gingi is possible to make ui more smaller %%
[3:46:47] blakexoxoxo: @MissAvantasia i work and watch stream at same time
[3:46:50] bingbongsanchez22: @britishbeef 100%
[3:47:14] Niuxe: @MissAvantasia Even if you do, 400 Euro to cook rice is still a lot for normal working people. At least here
[3:47:18] britishbeef: R1 40 year old gingi xd
[3:47:24] bingbongsanchez22: @britishbeef Funny thing is, I’m older than all of them nur is more fun to make jokes about the gang PixelBob
[3:47:33] xenobolic: gingi's dps is because of the rice cooker, if you dont know now you know
[3:47:41] Niuxe: Not enough to get wild about, but it's not a impulse buy for most people
[3:47:57] hidingi: €400 is 2½ bottles on the nearest club
[3:48:06] hidingi: rice cooker is way better than 2½ bottles on a club
[3:48:34] Niuxe: Well, you could.... not buy any of those?
[3:48:47] hidingi: Then what am I supposed to do with my €400?
[3:48:49] MissAvantasia: @MissAvantasia I can safely say that no one in my surroudings of friends or family would feel its life changing. So i guess its what yopu chose to work with.

[3:49:41] creepywalker: so for keys 22-26 what is better BM or Havoc ?? i have both cant rly decide:D
[3:49:48] treyywow: I just bought a 10,000 dollar rice cooker because you told me too @gingitv now I can’t pay rent
[3:49:53] hidingi: creepywalker The answer is never BM.
[3:50:02] MissAvantasia: @hidingi well, I know for a fact that the majority of Mikes viewers isnt from cambodja...
[3:50:09] pbob: hes got ze black lung
[3:50:11] Niuxe: @MissAvantasia Still saying it as "Doesn't people have a job?" is just showing not knowing how much 400 euro is for a lot of people. By all means, itn't no life chaning money, but to cook rice, I can say a lot of people wanna spend them elsewhere
[3:50:12] AstroNemus: @GingiTV JUst dont be sick 5head
[3:50:13] MissAvantasia: @Bingbongsanchez Hopefully this summer
[3:50:15] potatoschweg: sold my waif for ricecooker, much bettter rice now

[3:54:01] creepywalker: @MissAvantasia coffee machine mostbe good !
[3:54:03] Epiclawlzable: my group would omega die to those spiders lol
[3:54:20] MissAvantasia: @MissAvantasia Its magical!
[3:54:31] letzwaa: what's the weak aura showing cast bars with marks and target name ?
[3:54:41] fbgchris: I feel like if you enjoy something alot and can afford it without it hurting you financially then go for it!
[3:55:06] fbgchris: @creepywalker I save money rather then going and buying drinks everyday weSmart
[3:55:08] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Gingi and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[3:55:15] hidingi: MissAvantasia I spent 5k on a bed, due to my severe backpains and people are always commenting on that. I haven't had backpain for 4½ years now, so to me, it was worth it ^^
[3:55:23] fbgchris: ^^^
[3:55:24] Prime_Rage: canex always has some weird problem when hes asigned to do something
[3:55:33] fbgchris: beds get real pricey
[3:55:52] letzwaa: what's the weak aura (left of his character) showing cast bars with marks and target name ?
[3:55:58] fbgchris: I saw one with the frame that you can control with the remote. almost the price of a used car
[3:56:06] mohscoops: Why doesnt PI go to meeres he pumps more no?
[3:56:09] creepywalker: its just sad to see a mage in full combust and still the dmg isnt top noch
[3:56:11] fbgchris: but soooo comfortable
[3:56:14] hidingi: Yea mine doesn't have any fancy featuers or anything, that would have been even more expensive :D
[3:56:22] itsbrand_: @hidingi that’s for your own health. where I live minimum wage is 970eur, i’d spent thousands if health was involved
[3:56:35] fbgchris: @hidingi you can't put a price on being comfortable tbh
[3:56:38] qtceef: @mohscoops prob beacuse it never lines up good
[3:56:46] qtceef: u can pi a mage on cd
[3:57:23] mohscoops: they have comms tho surely pi on meeres would be better in some cases
[3:57:51] qtceef: they probably do pi him when it lines up with army and stuff
[3:57:59] SnekVen0m: @letzwaa Think thats just a focus frame no?
[3:58:12] letzwaa: @SnekVen0m no all mobs are shown, not only his focus
[3:58:47] Hurbob14: it’s just a weak aura for important queues
