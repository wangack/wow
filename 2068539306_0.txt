[0:19:01] snipez_zgz: lib is last step
[0:19:08] cmomoney2000: Pain sup is 4 echos
[0:19:25] cmomoney2000: Yeah and there's a. Order
[0:19:33] snipez_zgz: only order once u in lib
[0:19:33] Rmont: agitated 19 min in, what we got going on
[0:19:44] snipez_zgz: doens'tmatter what order you get them prior to going into lib
[0:19:55] Twoblackeyes_ZGZ: some transparency would have been nice
[0:20:01] Rmont: is that what he was saying about the 3 day has been on the same rotation since 2004 and they couldnt adjust it?
[0:20:33] Rmont: like behind the scenes yesterday fell on the 3 day lockout technically
[0:20:55] Rmont: youd think that would be a simple hotfix
[0:21:01] Rmont: to just reset all lockouts and get everyone on track...
[0:21:15] Rmont: like it sounds like just a sql update
[0:21:27] reborndevil96: Mediocrity
[0:21:28] cajuncanuck: a game this mature surely has an announcement banner with times explaining this in game.
[0:21:44] cmomoney2000: Here's the order
[0:21:46] cmomoney2000: Warrior - ￼ Swamp Echo  Mage - ￼ Arathi Echo  Paladin - ￼ Theramore Echo  Priest - ￼ Graveyard Echo
[0:22:09] OnlyPureSkill: tuned in late what happened with the lockouts?
[0:22:10] snipez_zgz: order outside of lib doesn't matter
[0:22:29] snipez_zgz: only clicking the echo's in order in lib matter

[0:24:40] Rmont: saw a clip of someone calculating asmons alt channel hosting cost, costing twitch $3m/year and he runs no ads/subs/etc lol that has to piss them off
[0:24:52] cajuncanuck: failure to communicate...rough
[0:25:50] Rmont: dont know if it was based on retail pricing
[0:25:56] cajuncanuck: they want retail cost for tax write offs
[0:26:46] Lusciousdan: Either taxes, or just for arguing why not to pay strimmers more
[0:26:50] cajuncanuck: they're crying about it costing too much, but it's a benefit to the company at large, and a way to cut staff
[0:26:54] Zoos_tv: why do you want graveyard?
[0:26:58] snipez_zgz: gy echi is front left grave stone area
