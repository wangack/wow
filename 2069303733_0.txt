[0:59:15] Sharrak0r: all they did was normalise weapon speed for raptor strike with 2x 1h weps - that's a buff if the hunter was using fast weapons
[0:59:18] DjUrsu: wotlk icon
[0:59:48] itsRVNG: can interupt it
[0:59:53] DjUrsu: maybe kick works

[1:03:29] global_shift: @PROSTOMPER It's gonna be very fun. But going from vanilla to cata is a big step up in terms of difficulties
[1:04:08] itsRVNG: @global_shift Good, haha
[1:04:13] dominikvoss: greetings greetings
[1:04:35] JanDeGrote1: Going from vanilla rag to cata rag is a little step up Kappa

[5:45:29] Buschw00ki: kekok great addon
[5:45:31] Elmesioo: How do you get to that page? Warcraft logs is dogshit.

[5:46:47] Buschw00ki: Swiper
[5:47:31] Creoxx: highest boomkin dps is like 361
[5:47:34] masterxd69: they got nerfed big but coming back soon i think
[5:47:59] Creoxx: 380
[5:48:27] Elmesioo: COPIUM 2H enhance might work.
[5:48:28] hazzard02: there is one guy
[5:48:30] hazzard02: in the top 20
[5:49:09] Elmesioo: That doesnt mean its good. These raids are made for dad gamers.
[5:49:13] DjUrsu: get pummler on 2h ench and zugzug. 1 attack per sec
[5:49:26] Sofiebabtist: Then you're able to buy the recepies after that
[5:49:28] Elmesioo: Yeah, steal pummeler from a druid. :)
[5:49:31] masterxd69: you buy recipe for 25g and then craft for 150g more
[5:49:50] Elmesioo: I'd probably play 2H enhance also.
[5:50:09] Sofiebabtist: The Grime drop will increase now also and also drop more items for each one so would wait a bit to buy the mats cuz the market are going to crash.
[5:50:22] masterxd69: @Sofiebabtist yea crafting will drop a bunch now
[5:50:36] masterxd69: you need 12 total i believe
[5:50:39] Sofiebabtist: You can use it anyways wont hurt you
[5:50:42] masterxd69: unless you buy everything
[5:50:58] masterxd69: yea
[5:50:59] Sofiebabtist: You get like 1 bar for 2 grimes.
[5:51:18] Sofiebabtist: and you need like 4 bars for the head + Tailor shit and stuff
[5:51:27] jk10100: You trade them in for boxes - you get better rewards from the boxes if you have double crafting proff 200_+
[5:51:44] masterxd69: i still think they made everythung wayyyy to expensive as a druid atleast
[5:52:06] JUICY604: fury today? I thought arms was the spec of choice.
[5:52:37] masterxd69: i think they did it to get some gold out of the game but it didnt really work
[5:53:03] lindellmannen: hi prefox! you going fury?
[5:53:08] global_shift: I spent like 300g to get 175-225 in bs and buy mats for epic helm
[5:53:39] global_shift: Blizz 10/10 idea to ban goldtrading
[5:53:48] masterxd69: @global_shift i swapped to boomie so had to spend another 75g to trade trinket lol and i would need another 75 to get ap again
[5:53:48] global_shift: People have even gotten banned gold trading
[5:53:53] psyko_123: at least you are not branz poor
[5:54:17] quellaxx: Just don't pay him back EZ
[5:54:41] jk10100: Another perspective is there isn't a lot to do at 40 outside of the raid. This at least gives something for people to aim for
