[5:52:55] thegillthrill: Hows the leveling speed from 60-70. 5-10 hours?
[5:52:59] abracka_: i think they just do legion first to get the dal hearth to use later
[5:53:00] soysos91: silverpine with legion chromietime?
[5:53:12] freddy_fazbearrr: i do wod intro then sliver/brad then wod for bonus
[5:53:16] stratiss: the way it works, is if you're not in chromie time duskwood only scales to 30
[5:53:17] hypedrobot: if you do westfall and darkwood as ally you're basically fully leveled if you have heirlooms
[5:53:31] HbcMomo: WoD intro is like 5 levels
[5:53:33] Collected1: chromie time is the same regardless of which expansion, it just triggers the intro quest
[5:53:34] xcroutonicx: wait is that for a brand new character???
[5:53:34] Sluggs_: silverpine has so many rares that give as much xp as a quest
[5:53:42] Collected1: and the only reason legion start is included is to get an extra hearth
[5:53:46] Collected1: it's for speed runners basically
[5:53:53] stratiss: so by selecting a campaign you're making duskwood/redridge etc scale to 60
[5:53:55] cptrogers123: Is there a random transmog run generator spin? @Towelliee

[6:21:56] AvrithSATX: It's b/c some streamers are clowns who just stir toxicity. That's obviously not the majority, but unfortunately some of those clowns have large audiences.

[6:27:20] DallTV_: the newest bf had less players then bf4 :P
[6:27:23] AvrithSATX: People want to blame Streamers for the decline in <Game> is b/c they perceive the Streamers to have the ear of the developer and get their feedback implemented over "the masses" feedback. /shrug

[6:37:08] Nuaada: has anyone noticed Demon hunters doing insane damage right now?
[6:37:10] aeminence: On that note @Towelliee  the game does need more content out side of M+, raiding and pvp lol.
[6:37:10] DeanoTV: yeah i like grinds so without grinds i hope it can keep me occupied
[6:37:12] MILESkg21: Crafting gonna be a full time job now

[6:37:33] CMack_72: There was no borrowed power in classic and classic seems to be very popular.
[6:37:42] Sherbert1492: so what is borrowed power
[6:37:42] Funderik: orcale thd will be right after all this

[6:37:51] BlewGamingGroup: just give me corruption back
[6:37:53] Aidler: That’s me… and I never argued against borrowed powers
[6:37:59] Molvonos: @CMack_72 Classic had borrowed power; Tier sets.

[6:38:10] Greneer: as an altholic this is a dream expac
[6:38:13] Dygytalyzed: can't ruin Dragonflight? * Bellular says "hold my beer" *
[6:38:13] Vivelli: @arcturon3 why are u here if u hate wow so much?
[6:38:17] ashtin2220: ret pally is underpowered
[6:38:18] fungztartv: @Towelliee is your XP bar a weakaura or? :D
[6:38:21] Sollice: I am hoping the talent system revert sticks beyond just this expansion. This is the problem I think with the expansions. No investment in to big systems because they get replaced or changed
[6:38:23] abracka_: said it yesterday, but i don't think the issue was borrowed power itself. the issue was that those borrowed power systems punished you for playing alts with not respecting your time. if they had proper, easy and account wide systems to it, wouldn't be so bad
[6:38:25] warrenny: If ret was extremely bad it would kill that patch for me
[6:38:29] silentknight190: I would love to avoid all content after litch king to get to new content for the new expansion
[6:38:31] HeyRaynor: cata feral was some bulllshit!!!
[6:38:31] HealsAndThat: I am a fan of ass, I hate how people complain about things being ass :(
[6:38:36] Rohen86: Feral went hard S1 Legion
[6:38:36] Austei: heh
[6:38:38] Fortvila: they will add something called dragontouched or touch of aspect as some borrowed power. Cause people will ask for it
[6:38:38] TheeCableguy: Good news feral is bonkers rn
[6:38:39] formation2252: Psy_Bear that you?
[6:38:39] zeeAbe: Ferals on the boomkin watch after these comments
[6:38:43] NickLeonhearth: Always find a way to shit on a feral no matter the topic :D
[6:38:47] Flyer_753: Players that only play 1 spec are more susceptible to liking/disliking class balance
[6:38:48] DuploThief: @arcturon3 why do you have to be toxic and complaining about a game you don't even plan on playing and saying "it will just be the same you will see" is complaining
[6:38:49] Kelticlore: I thought WOD was a great expansion
[6:38:52] Somchi: @Towelliee whats your tier list on tanks as of now?
[6:38:53] CalcasOOM: just. 🙌 no more borrowed power
[6:38:57] DeanoTV: @Towelliee do u think theres gonna be enough to occupy us without a grind?

[6:39:03] MILESkg21: Account wide everything plz :)
[6:39:16] BlewGamingGroup: if they bring back borrowed power . they NEED to make it account wide
[6:39:23] arcturon3: but that was also the msg about shadowlands they also said its altfriendly and it wasnt
[6:39:23] Vivelli: its odd that now that im not forced to login, i kinda wanna login more, but thats due to the professions changes i think
[6:39:28] thasthebear: THD is probably sadge no AP to grind
[6:39:42] TheeCableguy: literally like 4-5 alts with same time
[6:39:57] HealsAndThat: Wod is weird in that way, because it did not have a lot going for itself. but the things it had, were quite good! Minus the garrison, the dungeons were fun, albeit obsolete pretty early on, the raids were amazing. But HFC was too long, Pvp was brilliant
[6:40:04] Zzorski: THD malding no joke
[6:40:16] DuploThief: @arcturon3 but it was because you could buy 40 and 60 renown on alts
[6:40:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Yoshi P philosophy takes a lot of pressure off a lot of people
[6:40:23] MILESkg21: investors were probably pissed LuL
[6:40:36] xsp00n: challenge accepted
[6:40:44] Eraste: now if only they can tighten up the class balance a little bit
[6:40:44] im_n0t_jezus: DF going to be awesome ! people are always complainers
[6:40:47] CalcasOOM: I don't understand people who want it to fail
[6:40:50] CalcasOOM: just why
[6:40:56] DeanoTV: @DropZeBait WOD had actual 0 content for casuals
[6:40:57] aeminence: aslong as they keep that forced MSQ bullshit away from WoW then im gucci. I wish we did have the casual shit FFXIV had like housing and professions like carpentry etc
[6:40:57] Bl4ckSauce: Yeah endless grinds definitely not my thing , i am not 18 anymore
[6:40:57] Unciatim: More wasnt' necessarily the problem... More for the same shit as we got with less before was the issue./..
[6:41:00] DeanoTV: worst expac
[6:41:00] HealsAndThat: It has a lot to live up to though, if it seems good on paper.
[6:41:05] jason_tacey: any Evoker healers in chat, how are you liking the healing aspect of the class?
[6:41:12] FluffyDooom: I'm one of those weirdos that liked island expeditions, both for cosmetics and for the AP :D
[6:41:30] HealsAndThat: @DeanoTV I am unable to comment on that, I am definitely not hardcore, top 5-700 ish

[6:41:33] havoom01: and i tough that mmorpg games means grinding..tho pps complain about it in WoW
[6:41:34] DevilSpire: there has always been people that wanted wow to fail
[6:41:40] HealsAndThat: But not casual either, you know.
[6:41:43] oldmanmetal: thwe only thing that makes it better is if they did account reps
[6:41:43] Nerendis: Imagine just logging into an alt and playing the,?
[6:41:46] Nerendis: Crazy
[6:41:47] TheeCableguy: the only grind is professions if you want to
[6:41:53] xsp00n: imagine if dragonflight comes in with a strong 10.1 raid like BRF or NH, the xpac is going to slap
[6:41:53] BlewGamingGroup: this expansion is going to be great for anyone that wants to play alts and farm transmog and mounts
[6:42:00] jawnbone: Worgens can be monks now???

[6:42:06] Autoexeq: @havoom01 It's not grinding...it's the insane amount of grinding
[6:42:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: That conduit grind was awful at the start of Shadowlands, ugh
[6:42:11] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[6:42:14] arcturon3: is it only 4-5 hours again to reach 70 from 60? LUL
[6:42:14] pyx7: sounds blissful
[6:42:17] Aidler: I have a feeling there are a few very basic philosophical flaws in the concept…. but we will see. maybe I’m wrong
[6:42:19] zgag: I tried out the beta and I do have to disagree with those who didn't like dragon riding.  I think DR will be a hit with the player base
[6:42:19] Vivelli: som ppl like a ton ton of forced grinding, i hope they can find something they enjoy in this expac cuz they seem to be the out crowd now
[6:42:20] symegaming: so you can go from lvl 1 to max in a few hours now
[6:42:21] andycoin99: i hope thats the case
[6:42:29] andycoin99: all the classes are fun to play
[6:42:33] Panaxx: they need to make rep account wide
[6:42:37] HealsAndThat: So, you cap > do dungeons until you're whatever the best is that drops from heroic, and 3 weeks of mythics. And go raiding. The rest, is your oyster ?! That's great.
[6:42:40] Kelticlore: im surprised were not getting a new Vendor Mount this expansion
[6:42:41] ninedraft317: i still dont know what i want to main for df
[6:42:53] aeminence: @Towelliee  will I need  a seprate toon for PVP/PVE due to the vault?
[6:43:00] Valvax: definitely a healthier playstyle
[6:43:02] Pesky_Ninja: you also get extra charges on catalyst for alts @Towelliee
[6:43:03] TheeCableguy: crafting also catches you up to raid tier
[6:43:07] Thoreya: As someone who plays WoW as it’s main game bc no time for any other game. I loved bfa. Always had something to do
[6:43:09] manmower: all your toons should share one renown bar
[6:43:17] EKS90_: @havoom01 it means an massive online RPG, mmo doesnt mean grinding in that sense, it depends on what type of grind and how much of it is a "fun" gameplay looop grinding for the sake of grinding is bad
[6:43:18] byrdeen45: i dont like where theres no self loot in raids now
[6:43:20] jonlewis72: uber noob question, which raid does that transmog come from?
[6:43:20] RagingPunk: yea ur alts get it
[6:43:31] DinoBornX: from a single parent perspective, this sounds amazing
[6:43:35] DevilSpire: @Towelliee i wont know what to do with my hands :P
[6:43:41] zeeAbe: @Towelliee also renown gives the materials to craft heroic raid level gear, so if you are capped on renown on main you can log in on alt, get max renown easy and craft some goodies
[6:43:43] freimannjagd: that means they need to put enough content to keep us entertained
[6:43:50] maekshift: I haven't played in almost 4 years, very excited for the flex in this game
[6:43:52] Vivelli: yea go play other games lol
[6:43:53] skdmaster: skdmaster subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[6:43:54] ArcaneRaver23: there needs to be more account wide unlocks for sure, still waiting on acc wide rep unlocks (at least for the ones not faction locked)
[6:43:55] Nokterian: As altoholic myself im happy with this @Towelliee

[6:44:01] aeminence: Did the 1% even like that dumb grindy shit?
[6:44:01] RagingPunk: glad im into professions
[6:44:03] GeneralMishaps: That's good. Casuals drive the game and keep it alive. Allows we hardcores to do a little hardcore AND play other games.
[6:44:05] dantemustdie33: is it too late to start wow as a new palyer?
[6:44:07] BlewGamingGroup: blizz wants their casual money back

[6:44:28] Nokterian: i grind when i need to
[6:44:29] gking3000: its because its low level expac, newer expacs get secondary stats
[6:44:30] GeneralMishaps: I hate the dumb grindy shit.
[6:44:39] Brodih_: like yout Thdlock
[6:44:40] TompsonX: liquid and echo aren't 1% tho, they are 0.0001
[6:44:40] merlynx28: so where can we see the highest item lvl to be in the game ???
[6:44:40] oldmanmetal: maybe if the grind went back to not being gated like vanilla
[6:44:43] Brodih_: your*
[6:44:44] resergz: how is the new heirloom trinket?
[6:44:47] thiccsushi: top 10 guilds are like 0.001%

[6:44:52] TenoxNor: I am looking forward to professions
[6:44:56] aeminence: I remember in S1 of SL of not wanting to miss a week of Torghast or you perma fell behind. Was that enjoyable for ANYONE? @Towelliee
