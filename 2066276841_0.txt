[0:36:50] Sibernetiq: just like riposte build
[0:37:10] ThorinRynd: @Sibernetiq I tank BFD often, it's pretty good. In Gnomer we struggle on the last boss because avoidance doesn't work against spell stuff

[1:52:01] bobo5314: hvac humidity
[1:52:05] bassiemon123: Only solo till they fix
[1:52:07] Peoplewhinetoomuch: And people jumping in and out of layers randomly

[1:52:10] isellvc_: tbh
[1:52:21] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Everyone is at the boss usually.

[1:52:39] h0t_sauce7: too many layers

[1:55:05] Peoplewhinetoomuch: the cities feel empty since layering
[1:55:41] Pwnoqraphy: @Lucons1 my best event was round about 1700
[1:55:51] Lucons1: solo?
[1:55:54] Mystiggo: It's tough for them. STV would be unplayable without the layers
[1:56:02] SAMO0RA1: yeah for the 2nd time today i did ashenvale pvp event with 10 ppl this is absurd
[1:56:03] Pwnoqraphy: solo 1,1k i think

[4:30:40] Finaija: It's a bit shame how much they've had to cut on material quality etc to reduce cost. plastics etc, and fitting of bodyparts are not on par with the overall car quality.
[4:30:43] hardliquor: just buy 2 since they are so cheap

[4:32:45] LillaJeon: Isn't a Volvo v60 around $55k? So Tesla being 30-45k is very surprising to me

[6:25:25] StreamElements: Check out my Merch here! -> https://merch.streamelements.com/psherotv
[6:25:32] Bodywrecker: Alaska is twice the size, and the only tax we have is a sales and federal.  There is no income tax, and when you're done paying a note on property, you no longer own property tax.  For example, I have a "z tag" on my vehicle, I don't owe anyone anything for it anymore
[6:25:40] xTrueEast: 17k on long island ny ill take the 8k
[6:25:54] edman552: !ыукмук
[6:26:07] TizyTV77: govt pays people to live in alaska
[6:26:16] Paramaum: @Iol69 north is shit, go south, dont change the state. S Florida is one of the best places you can live in the US...
