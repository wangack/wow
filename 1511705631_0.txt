[1:10:09] Motivess: @nightwulf927 I personally think MoP zones are some of the weakest in the game
[1:10:11] Nightwulf927: Legion has such good zones and raids too
[1:10:21] mmo_kenna_: I loved Naxx because I never got to see it in Classic, managed to do the Undying achieve

[1:12:35] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee did you see that they are going to buff naxx for wotlk classic ?
[1:12:43] Tigerklaue: wrath had the best zones loved all of them
[1:13:00] Scraggersmeh: Thoughts on them considering making 10/25 the exact same loot wise?

[1:14:17] Allemongo: didn't quest markers come in Cata? i think i used QuestHelper back in Wotlk

[3:01:52] Moobot: @monklaxus Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:02:48] DeanoTV: this is beta wut KEKW
[3:03:14] Finiin: Joyous Journeys is what they call the 50% xp buff coming in the next fews weeks for BC

[3:03:36] N3wl34f: For every server no?
[3:03:43] Spathotan: They are asking cause they wernt playing during wrath and dont know what Northrend looks like more than likey.
[3:03:44] N3wl34f: yeah only 6-8 weeks
[3:04:08] nolimitzawr: Whats the point of playing Wotlk beta when u play game for 15y already? Can't just wait for Wotlk classic release?
[3:04:11] Ayemis: i wanna start on a fresh server
[3:04:30] N3wl34f: @nolimitzawr i feel the sane¨
[3:04:34] N3wl34f: same*

[3:05:16] bennyx123: Do you have a favorite raid boss from wotlk?
[3:05:17] symerestinks: Know you’ve for sure been asked this but do U expect blizz to keep releasing classic past like mop
[3:05:26] nolimitzawr: @N3wl34f i understand beta Dragonblight or something new but old beta is just nonsense lol ... its like testing what was tested for 15years already
[3:05:54] BaldBroGaming: I think they will do new types of season of mastery, with new rules

[3:06:44] N3wl34f: @nolimitzawr Oh I thought you ment, because its boring to play a beta. No I think they need to test it cause its on a modern engine with old data. As every classic game so far. So there are bugs all over.
[3:06:57] Wcvechten: straight to the shadowlands ofcourse Kappa
[3:07:01] GreatWhiteDav: hope they re-do the garrosh stuff, that was really cool would love to see it reimagined

[3:08:13] Hypertitan: I like the way the game has evolved into current.  But not how the story has evolved.  Honestly the classic stuff doesn't interest me at all personally.  I get it, it's just not for me
[3:08:28] alalonso89: WoW: Multiverse of Madness?
[3:08:40] pyyr00: i'm all for like a classic+ type thing. New content for wrath would be sick

[3:09:16] crypticnightwing21: New stuff in Northrend or just new stuff in general? @Towelliee
[3:09:19] Evcon_: cuz he would have beat kiljaeden with the help of the naruu
[3:09:21] snuffles_80: is that a LotR thing?

[3:09:30] Zedar_Frost: so a timeline where Arthas's sould wasn't snatched and thrown directly into the maw?

[3:45:40] Zedar_Frost: @Towelliee There's an extra hidden quest near here on the cliffside. There's a big egg you can touch that I believe spawns a big moth. You get an item from it that starts a quest

[4:47:35] KombatWombat07: the $90 gig also provides a 1 month subscription too
[4:47:39] warrenny: £70 is fine for epic imo
[4:47:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Ryathael there is no seal of blood in wotlk
[4:47:46] Dalinaar: No inv yet QQ
[4:47:57] Korupcija_: oh shit it's tazavesh
[4:48:02] mavericks312: the 30 days game time and free boost is like 50$ normally lol
[4:48:23] Aquadriel: grrgll? thats what she said
[4:48:27] adambhombs: any idea when wotlk classic will be live
[4:48:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: big orca
[4:48:39] Ryathael: @HaxzorJimDuggan There is, added in BC, removed in 3.2
[4:48:39] wraaith: ice burgs to the right
[4:48:59] wildwittra: ohh. you must read the quest-text poggers!
[4:49:03] Rudric_Ice: the heroic edition is basically $84 bucks
[4:49:03] TwitchPlusMe: !WOTLK
[4:49:04] Moobot: @TwitchPlusMe Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[4:49:05] theonebrenz: $90 dollar expansion is insanity... no other way to put it
[4:49:16] Cramer: @adambhombs speculation but prob september based on previous beta -> release timelines
[4:49:17] vulkankragon: so in the end blizzard is competing with itself
[4:49:18] Bakjepluh: do ppl choose lock because they are op in retail? and they think they are op in classic?
[4:49:29] killtor: Is beta out for non-press players?
[4:49:48] mavericks312: @theonebrenz not really you get more stuff in it thats worth more then 90$
[4:49:49] warrenny: @theonebrenz What a disingenuous comment its a collectors edition not a base expansion
[4:49:49] massyyxd: its $115 CAD
[4:49:53] KaisenSiru: Silly people PepeLaugh
[4:49:57] adambhombs: cool ty September will be here before we know it
[4:50:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: I bought the base one for $49.99, yeah
[4:50:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Ryathael hmm it does seem to still be in wrath but from what ive read its not one we use anyway, seal of command and vengance are the main ones
[4:50:11] vajgod: $50 at this point is still too expensive after all these years of releasing the same damn engine forcing monthly subs
[4:50:13] belfastcl: $50 seems standard these days
[4:50:14] ShadoodHD: i saw the wings... doesn't look worth it 🧐
[4:50:16] COMANDR69: people need to stop crying u get a month free which is 15$ u get a 60$ boost an u get toys mount an shit dont buy it then
[4:50:20] Mecabeast: I think it was like 170 aussie
[4:50:29] mmo_kenna_: it's alot of money but it's also good value, you get a 60 boost those are £50 alone
[4:50:35] Aquadriel: its like when they say the 6month mount costs 70 dollars... it doesnt cost 70 dollars, is actually free cause you are paying for 6 month, morons. @Towelliee
[4:50:44] wildwittra: i wonder when blizz will announce the Warcraft III they teased before
[4:50:45] Effin_Steffin: i wasnt mad at the 90 because of the free boost and the game time alone included
[4:50:45] Ryathael: @HaxzorJimDuggan I faintly remember it being the best DPS seal, overall, but it came with the downside of damaging you, so..
[4:50:46] Kisswani: I always buy the base edition with gold , and then upgrade with RL money
[4:50:50] ShadoodHD: inb4 they up the sub price Keepo
[4:50:51] fraktaliserad: stop killing animals :(
[4:50:53] ArcaneSyntax: BFA was also 50$
[4:50:58] Naturalbeef: It's the same people who complain about Mythic raids and never set foot in them
[4:51:02] Aidler: killing orcas…. sadge
[4:51:07] Mourningztar: prices go up. my wage stays the same
[4:51:08] prettylaidback1: why are people crying over a day of work to play a game for a year
[4:51:08] Rudric_Ice: its actually 65 bucks for the base edition if you count the sub
[4:51:12] Tinypeanut: $50 seems like a standard price to me
[4:51:14] Relic7: If you don't want to pay for it, don't pay for it....
[4:51:16] thekl0wn2: 900 percent value
[4:51:22] FerociouzMonk: people suck
[4:51:27] AveragePvp: A $60 boost In itself makes it worth and everything else is an added bonus
[4:51:31] Ryathael: @HaxzorJimDuggan Oh, thats why, SoB was the horde version of SoV.
[4:51:31] LeGoogs: Youre not allowed to thin rationally towellie, How are people supposed to be mad if you do? @Towelliee
[4:51:31] OssewTV: when do u think non streamers / content creators will get into the beta ?

[4:51:43] derNachtelf: only the gametime is intersting for me
[4:51:43] mmo_kenna_: Lmao
[4:51:49] vajgod: i think xpacs should be baseline $30 maximum
[4:51:56] vajgod: for lowest package
[4:51:56] KaisenSiru: pieThink fandyThink HahaThink
[4:52:00] DigitalChill: thinking? towStop towIt

[4:52:13] thekl0wn2: Honestly think they will delay it
[4:52:19] Arwenack: It's just pixels, it's not worth $0 let alone $90 :)
[4:52:22] mavericks312: @vajgod good luck with that
[4:52:22] Lightasaurus: With the gametime added its more like $75 for the epic
[4:52:30] rabidwargamer: ricing is pricing.
[4:52:31] Aquadriel: wonder if flasks will go up in price for season 4
[4:52:32] Velashen: Some people spend their lives being jealous of those who can afford things.
[4:52:35] warrenny: @eatonaround I literally bought it mid raid
[4:52:37] vulkankragon: the absurd amount of money that they earned from immortal wasn't enough
[4:52:37] Subparferal: 81 months holy shit
[4:52:37] Kisswani: I was thinking about upgrading with gold , but man 350k for a token is rough
[4:52:38] ShadoodHD: are tauren rogue available yet? 🤔

[4:53:07] Aquadriel: nice logic LUL
[4:53:09] Mecabeast: production probably started for df in 2020 then all hands on deck last oct/nov?
[4:53:10] sajjad_admiral: i had question , quest reward items is better or t6 t5 tbc gear ?

[4:53:30] Knucklebones: They are demons.
[4:53:31] Kisswani: @Towelliee that's why OW2 is gonna be free Kappa because DI rocks

[4:54:28] vajgod: overwatch lootboxes were good though. I got like 10 legendaries for every single hero for free
[4:54:29] thekl0wn2: I quit a little bit ago waiting on season 4 to come back
[4:54:31] Kisswani: @HaxzorJimDuggan it'll be more like : " the guy in front of me paid for a lot of gas , I'm gonna fill up for free "
[4:54:32] BericTV: Is the quest tracker in the game?
[4:54:34] N3llee: pretty sure in the grand scheme of things the battle pass is going to be more out of pocket.
[4:54:39] mansblake: Do you have 2 seals actve at once?
[4:54:45] FerociouzMonk: i don't even use the skins. i can't see my character anyway. besides  when emoting.

[4:57:42] Scorpiris_Junoh: lol voice <3 <3 <3
[4:57:42] thekl0wn2: Sound like boogie lol
[4:57:44] Arbszy: I will play Dragonflight when it comes out, but when it is raid time im switching over to ffxiv.
[4:57:45] jeneraljelly: first month of every xpac is pretty fun regardless of the xpac as a whole
[4:57:46] Kisswani: THIS IS BLIZZ's LAST CHANCE Kappa
[4:57:48] wyman1990vc: Dragonflight is gonna be fine def surprised for launch this year though
[4:57:49] N3llee: I loved preachs take on first hearing the news
[4:57:52] dwhalen2902: @thekl0wn2 LUL
[4:57:53] mavericks312: @XoXOrangejuiceXo one of these guys
[4:57:54] bye_acc: What kind of footage do they even want to see? LUL @Towelliee
[4:57:54] FerociouzMonk: world of warcraft skyrim expansion Kappa
[4:57:54] eatonaround: i've stopped and started playing WoW so many times at this point lol
[4:57:57] juga27: when did they add aoe looting?
[4:57:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: if blizzard tricks me 12 or 15 more times then IM DONE Kappa
[4:58:02] Mojohusk: Dragons would be cool if they didn't look like starving lizards
[4:58:03] Naturalbeef: and then go buy the Epic version
[4:58:03] DrWafflesaurus: you sounds like bill murry from Caddy Shack
[4:58:04] Bruteforcez: Sounds like my friends KEKW
[4:58:22] bawheid: its surprising how quickly some streamers refused to play blizz games after drunk sex assault allegations, only to stream blizz games again once the dust had settled
[4:58:36] RedXIII: I don't have a single friend that plays WoW anymore. lol
[4:58:43] thekl0wn2: I mean I’m gonna buy the epic version but I’ll hate it every min
[4:58:44] kalitka9: Hey there, could you please confirm/check what achivements are transferred over from TBC classic?
[4:58:56] Knucklebones: So is Wrath coming out around the same time? Seems insane.
[4:58:58] RedXIII: so I guess that's probably why I don't go back, I just watch you and other streamers play now. but I don't mind it
[4:59:00] Grotesko80: with Canada inflation, Dragonflight should cost 45$ compare to Shadowlands (11-20-2020 money compare to 11-20-2022 if they release at the same date). Dragonflight cost 55 CAN$, so it's still a 10$ profit increase.
[4:59:01] kevlar9406: @bawheid cause weve moved past it.
[4:59:08] Rudric_Ice: maybe preach will stick with FF14 when DF launches :)
[4:59:09] Arakai: I still have a screenshot of this moment from WotLK launch :)
[4:59:18] bye_acc: Is this like french cosplay?
[4:59:22] kevlar9406: 900% value people!
[4:59:32] vulkankragon: @Rudric_Ice he is a purist
[4:59:32] mavericks312: @bawheid becasue the ppl were fired and taken care of
[5:00:06] dwhalen2902: I wanna get to catching up on Shadowlands now that I'm taking a burnout break from Endwalker in FFXIV
[5:00:08] kalitka9: thanks!
[5:00:21] mavericks312: they even give you an ashes of alar acheivement even if you dont have iot
[5:00:26] abracka_: shit i need to do ZA for the amani warbear

[5:01:26] bawheid: @mavericks312 a few sacrificial goats dont sort problems on that scale. bad ass bobby is still in charge, the same bobby that issues death threats
[5:01:35] DrWafflesaurus: Did they say if they're going to link the retail with classic achievements or keep them separate? Having the blizzard bear achievement there makes it seem like they'll be linked
[5:01:38] temp3st98: he's like bobby sit in your corner dont anything LULW

[5:01:47] abracka_: reported LUL
[5:01:52] KatieGaming: Hiii towelliee. Doing good. !
[5:01:56] N3llee: Lucky you broke away from Lost Ark when you did. Its about as much of a shit show now as it was with New World launch.
[5:01:57] mavericks312: @bawheid bobby has a job for 1 more year he is gone eventually
[5:01:59] Aquadriel: yeah dno why gamers care so much about what activision does on the higher ups lol.
[5:02:02] warrenny: 30 min seals in wrath?
[5:02:12] KaisenSiru: Vengeance for Alliance
[5:02:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: that was intentional they gave that in tbc classic
[5:02:28] warrenny: That was intentional right they did it in bc?
[5:02:30] bawheid: @mavericks312 i wouldn't be so sure about that
[5:02:30] Kisswani: @Aquadriel Bobby does pvp balancing , didnt you know ? Kappa
[5:02:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: or do mean both versions of the same ablilities
[5:02:37] dwhalen2902: @dwhalen2902 I began playing early last summer and took 3 one month breaks over the course of the year I've been playing. Leveling alt jobs is a GREAT way to burn yourself out since alt leveling is shit in FF
[5:02:39] Aquadriel: Kisswani KEKW

[5:08:11] theBatwolf: ew legion
[5:08:21] colacrunchie: I can say MoP was #1 and wotlk #2
[5:08:23] doomdrake13: @Towelliee what was the worst one for you to play?
[5:08:27] Zorlaglol: Ye, kinda fucked us with MoP, that's what made me quit for years.
[5:08:30] KombatWombat07: Cata was meh. SL has been meh. so I see the resemblance
[5:08:32] smashwow: give me back cata over this SL junk any day
[5:08:33] Arbszy: Legion was great, MoP was good, BFA and WoD trash.
[5:08:33] stykri1: cata better then sl
[5:08:36] mavericks312: for me it's BC,Wrath, and legion
[5:08:44] abracka_: chat in shambles now
[5:08:45] spampurge: MoP was the best xpac
[5:08:48] dwhalen2902: I enjoyed Legion :)
[5:09:25] Kisswani: Hopefully this time we'll get a decent prepatch as well
[5:09:29] mavericks312: for me mop is bottom 3
[5:09:36] xALcaPWNedx: BC, Wrath, Legion :)

[5:09:39] abracka_: in case you guys want to see his tier list, https://youtu.be/CLrPHWHnfEw
[5:09:47] Zorlaglol: MoP was the best expansion for tanks and locks when it comes to pve
[5:09:54] Tausgi: SL goes below wod 4Head
[5:10:10] LspN: top4=BC, Wotlk, Legion, MoP
[5:10:15] Relic7: I didn't mind WoD
[5:10:19] Relic7: I loved MOP
[5:10:22] icculus: MoP disc priest OP
[5:10:24] KombatWombat07: wod was rock bottom, no going further than that one
[5:10:25] vulkankragon: without borrowed power what will we grind in this expac. majority of players dislike raid logging.
[5:10:30] Nehcrom: WoD was amazing as BM hunter so OP :P
[5:10:34] Metket: @Towelliee you were wondering about what they do for casuals players in dragonflight content wise. what do you think about shadowlands content for them to make it worse exp? covenant sanctum thingies were bad ? was korthia not enough? zereth mortis boring? how they can improve in dragonflight ?
[5:10:37] KaisenSiru: MoP anniesHug pieHug fandyLove
[5:10:39] jostartv: he's waiting for you to reseal
[5:10:44] smashwow: WoD was perfectly fine until you were done with the Raids.
[5:10:50] smashwow: LUL
[5:10:53] LeGoogs: I really Loved Cata I think DS just make people look back at it poorly
[5:11:00] StarbuckTech: i would have to say Legion and BC were the best XP. Ordering the others ones does not need to happen cause they all were meh
[5:11:00] ZeusDNA: Grinding each other un tiss un tiss
[5:11:00] theBatwolf: I judge expansions by whether or not I quit playing them and for how long.  SL is the only expansion to have made me quit for 18 months.
[5:11:09] Mecabeast: what zone comes after boring tundra technically coldarra? dragonblight?
[5:11:10] zysmos: being to play alts hopefuly
[5:11:15] Haizinberg: I want try come back to WoW used to play DH in BFA, does it still good? I mean as DD also as a Tank as well?  What about Classic, maybe better just prepare for WOTLK?

[5:20:37] ExtreemeCheese: I wish GW2 would release more with their expansions than just specs, zones, and story
[5:20:42] f1qck: how are the death knights?
[5:20:56] Cryttan: @mavericks312 It's just dog shit gatekeeping is what it is. LFD being cross server is what killed the social aspects. Spamming "INV" isn't a very social experience. Neither is taking flgith path to a dungeon.

[5:33:59] raldrik: it said east
[5:34:06] dwanex_: @eddietcloud wotlk was the beginning of the modern WoW. More class balance, rotations/prio systems instead of 1 button smashing, hard mode in raids (mythic raids light), LFD and more

[5:37:20] FuriousPorpoise: I fee like that is just something make healers struggle while everyone else just does the same old same old.

[5:53:27] Mecabeast: without flying you need a quest to get into dalaran I think
[5:53:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's just like a cooking trainer there along with the flight one
[5:53:35] arkRazer: Just ask a guard imo
[5:53:45] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee what are your thoughts on release do you think its too early?
[5:54:03] ShadoodHD: i think they added class trainer later in the expansions... not sure which
[5:54:23] mavericks312: them releasing this year isnt set in stone

[5:55:32] geokouts: for the quest to Dalaran you speak with the one that gave you the quest and you get teleported i think
[5:55:46] Mecabeast: I think bottom right area in borean ends with a quest to dalaran? can't remember exactly
[5:55:54] Kisswani: yeah
[5:56:16] Motraxtv: december 31th Kappa
[5:56:19] duffluv22: @geokouts I thought so too...from Crystalsong forest or something?
[5:56:26] gotcha2157: nah early 2023
[5:56:28] radagulf: YES it does or they will have to refund
[5:56:31] mavericks312: it would be smart to expect a delay
[5:56:33] Kisswani: but towelliee , twitter told me they'll have to refund everything if they delay BibleThump
[5:56:35] PvtHudson093: Raid coming out on or near Christmas is a big mistake
[5:56:45] Bayne77: my guess is december 32nd
[5:56:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: and they will offer the refund
[5:56:48] doomdrake13: lol why the fuck is there a bee symbol on the side of the Zeppelin?

[5:57:11] mavericks312: @radagulf nobody refunded shadowlands stop it
[5:57:18] net_mi: If I am not mistaken, didn't ret in wrath have an ability that put a 10% health reduction debuff on targets with auto attacks, or was that a bug?
[5:57:21] Masteve: @doomdrake13 Its clearly a sakc of bees.
[5:57:21] lecrabTV: yeah i bet people refunded and then just bought it again lol
[5:57:25] Rudric_Ice: raid aint coming out on 2022
[5:57:29] Kisswani: well ...
[5:57:31] mulletrocker11358: the only thing i had to refund from SL launch was my time off request for work!

[5:57:57] Blvdman: I heard some people refunded, they bought the Heroic/CE edition for the mount acheive, refunded and bought the normal.... Not sure if those rumors are true tho
[5:58:08] AveragePvp: @Korupcija_ nope they block you from purchasing their game if you get a refund Kappa
[5:58:13] mayonaes: reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

[5:58:35] FerociouzMonk: check Warsong Gluc
[5:58:37] gotcha2157: its optimal to start in borean tundra but i think i might quest a bit in howling fjord at the start of wrath, i didn't do much there at all besides UK and UP
[5:58:45] lecrabTV: i dont recall a paladin trainer in borean
[5:58:45] Sir_Nexic: letz go 71 divine plea incoming

[5:59:14] ShadoodHD: wait you missed it
[5:59:14] AveragePvp: @gotcha2157 it also might not be "optimal" because of all the people who are taking that route, so fjord might be solid you should do it
[5:59:32] lecrabTV: howling fjord is so good
[5:59:33] ShadoodHD: i think they put the trainers next to the entrance on a circle
[5:59:35] Bagel09: Love borean tundra!
[5:59:40] stratiss: boring tundra pog
[5:59:51] St4lk3er77: That circle of npcs at the entrance were probably trainers
[5:59:52] Reaghol: i did tundrea for achievement for RoB weapon
[5:59:55] arkRazer: How to even go to fjord? Is there an option when you take the zep?
[5:59:57] gotcha2157: @AveragePvp thats what i was thinking but the rep for the alliance expedition is great
[6:00:03] clarkiuswow: I agree, Borean Tundra feels bland compared to Howling Fjord
[6:00:03] Kisswani: I remember getting to Borean tundra and having the first Vehicle combat quest , man I was so impressed KEKW
[6:00:04] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: D:

[6:22:55] GreatWhiteDav: @GreatWhiteDav shadowlands (retail WoW, as opposed to classic WoW which is tbc atm) is very different, for a lot of people it's very fun. your sub gets you classic + retail so try both, but classic will give you the "story" and authentic world

[7:36:24] Kuyano: to the left
[7:36:36] c0mmander_starscream: "Reeeee, I want to talk to your manager".....
[7:37:24] Thoreya: pog

[7:39:50] turox90: Why dont you do it the old fashion way, and whisper them for dungeons
[7:39:53] whensdinnertv: That LFG system is so garbage
[7:39:56] BubblePriest: You'll have the elephant until ICC unlocks, then he will witness the Lich Kings end
[7:40:25] whensdinnertv: They need group finder or something like the m+ or people will just use 3rd party addons
[7:40:42] whensdinnertv: It’s so horse shit
[7:41:41] GreatWhiteDav: wha what's wrong with the new LFG?

[7:43:44] despairdk: do you have information on how many people are invited to the beta? or any info on waves?
[7:44:01] GreatWhiteDav: i don't see why they're so opposed to LFD at all tbh, but i think this is a fine compromise
[7:44:06] despairdk: thank you
[7:44:18] jakeslol: are free transfers still available in tbc?
[7:44:47] Kisswani: Naxx raid testing I assume ?

[7:47:27] despairdk: @Towelliee What is one quality of life improvement that is currently in Shadowlands that will be missed the most in wotlk classic?
[7:47:30] TwitchPlusMe: do do do do do

[7:49:04] GreatWhiteDav: group loot for me
[7:49:07] Brodih_: i think he meant QoL from retail thats not in classic
[7:49:12] TheBoogs: I thought it was a good question lol
[7:49:13] Bpsmooth: flip the question around and at least it would make more sense lol
[7:49:23] xavierfking1: Venruki said that they should allow cross-faction play like they did in 9.2.5 in Wrath bc factions are outdated especially in min/max era WoW
[7:49:29] PanduhsTV: pretty bummed there getting rid of aoe farming in wrath, I get the boosting but now I wont be able to aoe farm on my mage? wtf is that
[7:49:49] GreatWhiteDav: you can still mage aoe outside of dungeons at least
[7:49:59] Rabc83: the beta out then for the lucky ones?

[7:54:48] applejakxx: Are you hyped for wrath? I know you aren't the biggest classic guy @Towelliee
[7:55:03] TheBelli: idk the gear you have but yeah ppl in SWP lvl gear gonna just fly thru this
[7:55:16] MistyValkyrie: so that can be basically that could be gear you would get with a level 70 boost?
[7:55:20] ValorEpicPC: @Towelliee so if a player is really geared, should he just move to high level locations at start ?
[7:55:23] zikez: Towelliie  paladins always own! ;)
[7:55:24] Dalinaar: Also fire buff
[7:55:31] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee why did you create a template char and not copy over your tbc char ?
[7:55:37] all_beef_franks: Think about it. It’s intended to go from TBC leveling greens, so it shouldn’t be too hard.
[7:55:47] M__K__N: @Towelliee but that gear will last how many levels before we all gonna replace it for quest items? few levels?
[7:56:03] Sybexia: the change from spell power for pallies from BC to WOTLK screwed my gear
[7:56:03] Atem___: Its the Buffalo Tauren!

[8:02:28] wreckshoptv: hardmode again
[8:02:40] kaihole: that's a alliance questgiver, no?
[8:03:04] Roaringkittylol: Not really a beta then... more so friends and family alpha
[8:03:14] ceranac23: cross faction
[8:03:18] ceranac23: like in retail :D
[8:03:52] happybooger: escort quests are the worst
[8:03:55] FuriousPorpoise: current cap in beta is 76?
[8:04:13] Synk_live: can't wait to relive all these terrible quests!
[8:04:49] CrunkyBrewster: thats why you do Fjord instead
[8:04:50] Aquadriel: Howling fjord has AWFUL quest design.
[8:04:58] CrunkyBrewster: wut?
[8:05:15] sheyneguz: Yo Towellie whazzup ^^ Greetings from Germany ^^
[8:05:21] kaihole: amphitheater was great
[8:05:29] Aquadriel: Oh yeah is better than tundra for sure
[8:05:37] BigDiezel: @Towelliee what expansions are better than this?! if this is the 4th best?!
[8:06:00] twenty_zero: I actually like tundra (or at least I used to).
[8:06:07] soysos91: is wrath when "achievements" came out?
[8:06:10] Aquadriel: Thats why I thank Cataclysm so much cause it was a significantly better questing experience
[8:06:22] BigDiezel: @Towelliee WRONG!!!!!!!
[8:06:29] basementdwellingvirginx: @Towelliee But BC class design what terrible lol
[8:06:35] gidgeet: I agree
[8:06:41] Knine3: MOP raiding was fun
[8:06:54] BigDiezel: @Towelliee wrath has some of the best raiding teirs ever. including what many people consider the greatest raid in ulduar
[8:07:02] rhyminisback: i really cant wait for WotLk... i want to level my DK already :D
[8:07:12] Aquadriel: wrath baby spotted ResidentSleeper
[8:07:14] sheyneguz: saw you playing swtor last stream.. just reactivatet my "Stormcaller" (Sith Inquisitor) ^^ still a nice game ^^
[8:07:14] twenty_zero: Funny, Legion and Battle are by far the worst expansions for me
[8:07:21] Norbi33: what bosses was good in icc?
[8:07:23] Synk_live: I remember MOP launch and the first quest had everyone get on helicopters and it just lagged out everyone
[8:07:30] Sybexia: but Obsidium Sanctum!
[8:07:35] LegendSolve: Legion was dope
[8:07:36] PvtHudson093: chat is mad today
[8:07:38] turox90: ulduar to this day, still will be my n1 raid
[8:07:38] Aquadriel: facts
[8:07:39] Red_Dead_Redeem: MOP was borng af imo
[8:07:39] aleck1776: ICC lore is bis
[8:07:46] applejakxx: the only one I disagree with slightly is tbc. I think class design was kinda meh. MoP is probably my favorite expansion ever and legion was also sick (just had kind of a rough start). This is all IMO
[8:07:47] N3llee: disagree 100%
[8:07:50] N3llee: raiding was good
[8:07:51] frankieloI: hey :(
[8:07:52] misomander: all these rose-tinted glasses gonna get real faded in a few months im telling you
[8:07:53] N3llee: classes were good
[8:07:56] Dalinaar: Wrath of Frank KEKW
[8:07:57] PhillyRhino: Yo... Frank gotta die
[8:07:58] MadNeighborr: if u ask me cataclysm was best pve expansion :)
[8:07:59] FuriousPorpoise: I like Frank
[8:07:59] gooseboy429: wrath of khadghar
[8:08:01] BigDiezel: @Towelliee but thats part of why it is good lmao!
[8:08:04] moonscryer: you are being too truthful there towelliee, becareful.
[8:08:07] N3llee: dungeons were 100% best they ever were
[8:08:08] Remiix_o: that wouldn't hold people's interest for a second run through of WotLK tho
[8:08:09] nickelodeann: The lore and the class design / talents was the best imo
[8:08:11] frankieloI: @PhillyRhino D:
[8:08:15] gidgeet: TBC, Legion and MOP are my top three next would be  BFA
[8:08:16] Kman3107: But that's like.. your opinion. Kappa
[8:08:26] MadNeighborr: CATACLYSM!! :D
[8:08:27] all_beef_franks: some people like Frank..
[8:08:29] N3llee: questing and story was good
[8:08:30] Remiix_o: lore isn't why you're coming back to WotLK. let's be real
[8:08:33] N3llee: zones were great
[8:08:42] Aquadriel: @Towelliee and we thought classic babies were bad, now wotlk babies come out and are the real cancer KEKW
[8:08:43] applejakxx: i just think class design hit a peak in wrath. And ulduar and ICC were sick
[8:08:48] Hitmanblood: Hitmanblood subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 123 months! The best thing I enjoyed from wrath was class design. Raids are not a huge high point for me.
[8:08:49] PhillyRhino: @thekidfrankiex Don't worry, you good. :)
[8:08:56] Archrade: ULDUAR #1
[8:09:00] D3mitr1: Icc n ulduar
[8:09:04] aleck1776: Sounds like they are buffing Naxx at least so maybe itll be a little more interesting
[8:09:04] Norbi33: and now they buffing ther dmg and hp just to take longer and not more complicated xD
[8:09:04] frankieloI: @PhillyRhino KEKW god bless
[8:09:10] memnon94: eye of eternity best raid confirmed
[8:09:13] gotcha2157: wrath naxx was more accessible back then than naxx 40 was in classic though
[8:09:27] N3llee: 6hrs
[8:09:28] frankieloI: that shit is still going to get steamrolled with the buffs
[8:09:31] applejakxx: hopefully phase 1 is short lol :p
[8:09:31] lupesparza: That shield sound, I missed it 😍
[8:09:31] ToadyMcToadFace: Yo that's a bold title you got there my guy

[8:09:57] gidgeet: I disliked wrath because Arthas  was such a whiny bitch lol along with Jania god they were annoying but the zones were great
[8:10:00] D3mitr1: and 16 dungeons
[8:10:04] Atem___: SoM AQ 40 has been really fun with the new mechanics and more loot
[8:10:08] Dalinaar: I never looked into SoM, what was the premise?
[8:10:12] Subtlety_FL: mechanically easy, but punishing != hard
[8:10:27] metavahn231: oh he means WOD
[8:10:28] Synk_live: @Dalinaar just basically a harder version of classic
[8:10:30] z0mbawa: ayy
[8:10:30] Roaringkittylol: Thats it? lol
[8:10:36] 1Unselectable: girlfriend? whats his name?
[8:10:42] N3llee: @Towelliee mind sharing the meeting story. Never heard it before?
[8:10:59] z0mbawa: what's a girlfriend
[8:11:10] soysos91: wrath babies are reeeeing? haha
[8:11:14] Juiceboxed: Ulduar HM was fun to progress through
[8:11:18] nickelodeann: I have the most nostalgia for wrath, I don’t even know if it’s logical. I just had a lot of fun.
[8:11:33] Tamsu: "suddenly"?
[8:11:42] kaihole: the Lich King in the logo was why I started playing in WotLK :P
[8:11:47] Tamsu: he was literally the main character of whole warcraft 3
[8:11:49] Synk_live: Wrath is where I think a large portion of players first came into the game, so a lot of rose tinted glasses for it
[8:11:53] mezza77: Nothing will ever come close to Wrath for me
[8:12:12] Subtlety_FL: You're putting a spin on one of the best characters in WoW. It's your opinion, so can't hate

[8:12:16] Rudric_Ice: LUL
[8:12:18] gidgeet: Nah he was a whining little bitch 😂
[8:12:20] fewixtwo2: thats what i want
[8:12:22] profy0000: how are they going to test things if there are so few people invited?
[8:12:22] Red_Dead_Redeem: HellScream was annoying AF too

[8:12:28] Norbi33: Well wod had many Zugzugs every corner i mean orc's xD
[8:12:30] Berksgorh: lich king chase you down dungeon was pretty cool dohh
[8:12:32] metavahn231: wrath's gameplay loop was just to good
[8:12:35] BigDiezel: @Towelliee youd feel differently had you played warcraft
[8:12:47] Yoruus: @towelliee except Block warrior pvp, wrath made me quit Wow for years
[8:12:58] metavahn231: heroics we're fun AF and rewarding , same with pvp
[8:12:59] fewixtwo2: vs we goin to space bois, id take LK all day
[8:13:05] ArcaneSyntax: I loved wrath and I didn't even play Warcraft 3.
[8:13:18] Dalinaar: Damn, never thought about it that way. I liked seeing him the first time in each dungeon, but I can see how it got annoying.
[8:13:20] abracka_: i'm glad arthas was nothing more than a fart cloud in SL
[8:13:23] BigDiezel: @Towelliee also this may be the single greatest expansion for paladins. This should be your favorite lmao
[8:13:29] Hitmanblood: did you enjoy cata more? I remember you raided like crazy during then.
[8:13:36] Red_Dead_Redeem: WOTLK will always be the best expansion IMO other than TBC
[8:13:38] CrunkyBrewster: I dont have the same attachment to Warcraft either. Never played the rts games. Before Warcraft I was all about Diablo and Starcraft
[8:13:46] Synk_live: I think all of the expansions so far have started kinda bad (upon reflection) but most tend to end well, SL included
[8:14:06] PokerFaceMoose: did you like trial of the crusader at all?
[8:14:13] ArcaneSyntax: yeah paladin was op, but classes are way more fun now.
[8:14:19] soysos91: i just wanna be rezzed by a dk again lol
[8:14:19] CrunkyBrewster: I liked Trial for the Badge gear
[8:14:23] Juiceboxed: new expansions are a joke compared to the older stuff, especially the last 2
[8:14:28] Valentino_R: only started tanking in MOP so this expansion as a hunter as nice
[8:14:35] Ch0p_Su3y: Is that Beta?
[8:14:35] CrunkyBrewster: yeah it was easy LUL
[8:14:37] CrunkyBrewster: i aint gonna lie
[8:14:40] Kittastrophe: it was filler
[8:14:44] BigDiezel: Legion was good from start to finish
[8:14:46] billionvolt: @Towelliee hey, do you know if human racial got nerfed ?
[8:14:48] Hitmanblood: people don't remember the 400+ wipe saga on heroic rag on cata. that was insane.
[8:14:53] misomander: theres not a lot of skill in pressing holy shield on CD i much prefer newer style tanking compared to the old styles too
[8:14:58] Daemoos6: @Ch0p_Su3y Yep
[8:15:06] gidgeet: Shadowlands was like WOD to me, in loved MOP and BFA
[8:15:15] Berksgorh: i think every xpac with new class was so fun
[8:15:41] Red_Dead_Redeem: TBC,WOTLK, Legion and MOP were the best expansions imo.
[8:15:44] CrunkyBrewster: yeah i loved Mop as well. only complaint i had was the Golden Lotus/Shad Pan grind
[8:15:48] Juiceboxed: more buttons to press
[8:15:51] twenty_zero: @BigDiezel Depends who you ask - most ppl will agree, but for me it was by far the worst expansion. Boring class design, terrible first raid, terrible legendary system at the start and AP... the worst thing to every happened to WOW
[8:16:12] Subtlety_FL: Prot Paladin in wotlk = 9/6 rotation.
[8:16:27] SpidercowSD: Ah the MemberBerries are flooding back
[8:16:28] COMANDR69: @kirkules78 Thanks for the gift sub!
[8:16:32] Synk_live: @Juiceboxed Most people who say Legion is great, don't remember the first half of it was a terrible AP grind
[8:16:32] Red_Dead_Redeem: WOD and Cata were the worst expansions IMO
[8:16:50] MadNeighborr: cata worst? are u kidding me

[8:17:24] Synk_live: I remember playing WOW with only a 5 button mouse, now with years of using a Naga, I have no idea how I did it lol
[8:17:28] Sarocus: you have all the items
[8:17:30] CrunkyBrewster: Cata just felt disconnected for me. But i wouldnt say it was the worse. Except for Dragonsoul kind of being mid
[8:17:36] Juiceboxed: WOD was awful felt like logging on to do annoying dailies on a gacha game
[8:17:47] MadNeighborr: cata was excellent
[8:17:59] jalaledi1996: how u using 2 seal

[8:18:09] SpidercowSD: Anyone know if Spirit is still a thing thinking about getting Classic i remember having to farm it for mana regen
[8:18:09] twenty_zero: @Juiceboxed it had the best raids and class design - best expansion for me because I could raid log
[8:18:11] CrunkyBrewster: SeemsGood thats all that matters
[8:18:12] gidgeet: I liked Cata
[8:18:15] Biggles_93: it was amazing for me :)
[8:18:18] Jarjarbynksyy: i never got to play Wrath so im looking forward to it
[8:18:21] M__K__N: @Towelliee so tbc servers will be gone changed to wotlk but what after wotlk no way i will want to play another expansions like cata will they let us play wotlk forever like they left classic servers?
[8:18:28] Tharia: cata ruined my favorite zone. didn't like it for that. cata dungeons were fun though
[8:18:30] CrunkyBrewster: for me Wrath was my real taste into raiding
[8:18:32] metavahn231: wintergrasp is always a good time
[8:18:39] Red_Dead_Redeem: WOD was horrible
[8:18:40] kaihole: wintergrasp was fun
[8:18:43] lobstertechgaming: my favorite wow xpac ever
[8:18:45] misomander: im just sitting here hoping for a cata classic but i truly dont know if theyll push it that far
[8:18:53] CrunkyBrewster: also Wintergrasp pre-changes LUL I loved it despite the lagfest it was
[8:18:57] gotcha2157: did you get an email to let you know you were invited??

[8:18:58] Egzolinas: @Towelliee  did you play all these years only tank for the main?
[8:19:00] Subtlety_FL: @Dalinaar One of the most effective rotations was to bind your 9 second and 6 second abilities together and alternate. It was a sleeper way of doing it, but surprisingly yielded effective results.
[8:19:05] moggy1988: don't be daft only streamers get beta lol
[8:19:07] kaihole: they had Tol Barad in Cata
[8:19:07] zakare232: because ashran LUL
[8:19:12] CrunkyBrewster: hell yeah i looooved Wintergrasp.
[8:19:14] gidgeet: Wintergrasp was lit 🔥
[8:19:18] M__K__N: @Towelliee so tbc servers will be gone changed to wotlk but what after wotlk no way i will want to play another expansions like cata will they let us play wotlk forever like they left classic servers ?
[8:19:26] notColt45: idk what they are going to do for classic Wintergrasp
[8:19:28] misomander: tol barad was pretty organic while it was new
[8:19:34] CrunkyBrewster: it was the most time i was active in my guild. yell Wintergrasp was up and all your guildies be like "IM THERE!"
[8:19:37] kaihole: Tol Barad in Cata was just as fun to me
[8:19:41] Sarocus: bit further
[8:19:43] Hitmanblood: I think cata was peak twitch and youtube Era for wow
[8:19:50] kashmara: tol barad was pretty fun
[8:19:56] Nehcrom: How do you celebrate 4th of july towel?
[8:20:00] CrunkyBrewster: Cata was when I discovered Towelliee so yeah
[8:20:09] MadNeighborr: i wish they bring back cataclysm again
[8:20:22] ar_melol: strand of ancients was similar
[8:20:24] Rerdan: Wintergrasp Kreygasm
[8:20:26] misomander: tol barad was small scale skirms wintergrasp was some massive epic stuff
[8:20:30] soysos91: i was in a horde dominated server; it was fun for us lol
[8:20:31] Nehcrom: Or rather a much more broad question to the chat if you are american: how do you celebrate the 4th of july?
[8:20:34] Red_Dead_Redeem: I mean it was the whole "casuals" movement where pple had IRL stuff to do and couldn't riad and quest for hr on end so they catered more to that side
[8:20:43] norxnz: i wish i wouldve played mop
[8:20:47] gotcha2157: loved WG
[8:20:50] kaihole: paly's pissed me off with that lmao
[8:20:57] kashmara: I was a cata baby <3
[8:21:11] Sarocus: loot!
[8:21:21] Waterrmaloon: Arent you missing BoK buff?
[8:21:30] Subtlety_FL: That was a great feeling to win on a server that was 40/60, 50/50, or 60/40.
[8:21:36] SpidercowSD: End of Vanilla few months before TBC is when I joined wow, GOAT'd game
[8:22:03] Nehcrom: My question is because I am finally after being with my american wife for 12 years spednding the 4th in the US so just curious :)
[8:22:27] Nehcrom: Just how do you spend your 4th? :)
[8:22:35] memnon94: Father! Is it over... ?
[8:22:37] BigDiezel: @Towelliee its th righ mix of hardcord and casual
[8:22:49] Sarocus: @Nehcrom bbq and watching fireworks
[8:22:55] misomander: cata was great man
[8:22:57] Onisekai: i hope they do Cata classic tbh xD
[8:22:58] BigDiezel: @Towelliee the most recent expnsions are the wrong mix.
[8:23:00] misomander: the raids were so good
[8:23:02] soysos91: The Move
[8:23:02] kashmara: I don't think I've ever killed the lich king yet o_O
[8:23:10] SpidercowSD: cant have 40man raids forever lol
[8:23:12] legobind: the down fall was lfr
[8:23:16] mwchaos: True
[8:23:22] SensationalBanana: The downfall of WoW number 2507737985B.
[8:23:33] soysos91: @legobind agree
[8:23:39] twenty_zero: Yep, I do not understand the hate of QOL features.
[8:23:39] Nehcrom: @Nehcrom Sounds like every swedish summer besides the fireworks ;)
[8:24:03] kaihole: I think the downfall was wow tokens.
[8:24:21] jaalexba: @Nehcrom We usually run naked up and down the block
[8:24:31] AmZambie: @towelliee I hear that mmo Wildstar catered to everyone pretty well
[8:24:37] Nehcrom: @Nehcrom Wife still from the US so doubt that :P
[8:24:40] SensationalBanana: Before WoW tokens people bought gold from hackers. I'll take WoW token before 3rd party sellers, thanks.
[8:24:45] Hitmanblood: twin peaks hammer of fuck your face montages were funny.
[8:24:50] jaalexba: fine :)
[8:24:52] Sarocus: @jaalexba that's called Saturday
[8:25:03] keeindordel: THERE WAS ALSO A REASON Y WOTLK SUBS FLATLINED
[8:25:05] jaalexba: LUL
[8:25:14] Rayisbeast: Runescape was lit
[8:25:21] Subtlety_FL: I think in retrospect, it was a capitalization on how to bring in the most people, but after that was over, I'm sure some knew the falloff would be harder than any prior expansion. Therefore, began the cycle of throwing anything that sticks in every expansion after; i.e short-term gains.
[8:25:23] twenty_zero: Also internet was available for everybody etc
[8:25:34] bowsers1: League of Legends came out after wrath , thats why wow lost players lol
[8:25:38] SensationalBanana: @keeindordel They did not. They were high throughout.
[8:25:41] norxnz: wow came out and pretty much killed SWG
[8:25:50] barefoot_on_bricks: Didn't we have Conan at about the same time as WoTLK?
[8:26:01] misomander: wizard 101 POGGERS
[8:26:01] Nehcrom: WoW has killed a lot of games.
[8:26:05] Waterrmaloon: One of the best thing about cata was reforge and transmorg haha
[8:26:06] Sarocus: @barefoot_on_bricks Warhammer as well
[8:26:06] CrunkyBrewster: I was still playing City of Heroes on the side
[8:26:24] Nehcrom: WoW killed EQ for me and AO which I was dedicated to.
[8:26:26] AmZambie: city of villans>city of heros
[8:26:35] MorBlade: sEEMS i WAS PLAYING sTAR wARS gALAXIES AT THE TIME
[8:26:35] CodyKane: Plus WoW had all those cool comercials with MR T, Ozzy, Mini me!
[8:26:39] MorBlade: aCK
[8:26:39] keeindordel: dnt forget about the video gamming addiction stigma @towelliee

[8:28:53] keeindordel: @nehcrom talking about durring between 2006-2009 news articles and news station were pushing how video games were bad and could be addicting and do bad things for your life
[8:29:02] Genius_Kappa: i thought they implemented Quest helper in Wotlk
[8:29:02] AmZambie: cov/coh had that real nice fantasy of feeling like your character to it

[8:32:50] PTGfry: I did tundra on original release so I might do fjord this time around
[8:32:53] Berros: i like grizzley hills
[8:32:55] ProfessorChaoos: people called it boring tundra for a reason.
[8:32:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Grizzly Hills are epic
[8:33:02] fizzmyth: I think all zones are decent enough
[8:33:17] epicpockettroll: kinda liked gundraks aestetics aswell
[8:33:20] Hitmanblood: I don't think they unlocked the new graphics settings from wrath like the view distance slider
[8:33:39] Berros: true the music was the best
[8:33:41] Hitmanblood: I just wanna max out my view distance blizz towCry
[8:33:49] misomander: i really love dragonblight personally

[8:40:16] ZenLiving: Right, that is where the
[8:40:39] Aquadriel: many people thought classic was going to be a wow/mmo resurgence or revolution. boy how they were wrong.
[8:40:41] keeindordel: no seals
[8:40:46] ZenLiving: Where the joke, "Can't wait until Legion/Bfa/Shadowlands Classic!"
[8:40:46] keeindordel: no auras
[8:41:20] UnrealChef: Where does "Classic" end? IMO Wrath is the last classic expac
[8:41:31] zikez: will not go further then wotlk. after wotlk ends wow ends :D
[8:41:38] Aquadriel: the less annoyances and clunkyness of classic
[8:42:05] istormragex: when is the release date of WOTLK ?
[8:42:06] NotEnoughMana: do people still play vanilla classic or everyones on BC?
[8:42:19] ZenLiving: @UnrealChef I agree, WotLK feels like the "end" of the Classic era servers. Then I can see some kind of fresh release cycle of Vanilla - WotLK
[8:42:20] Moobot: 🐲 S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. 🐲
[8:42:27] keeindordel: yay
[8:42:41] paluker173: lol this guy... 4th best expansion. trying to cause a ruckus here

[8:42:52] raldrik: I think it is also starting to show how little the core game has evolved in the last 10 years. I think that is the borrowed power argument. The game used to evolve now we just have 2 year game seasons
[8:43:07] mikef2022: Leveling as prot not so bad?
[8:43:18] Shuttlelol: @Rockxle i know right, dude is being too generous calling WOTLK 4th best LULW
[8:43:57] istormragex: when is the release date of WOTLK ?
[8:44:38] zeiours: @towelliee still play Diablo immortal? Just got to paragon 30, so wish WoW had a paragon system
[8:44:45] paluker173: a lot more to do doesnt equal quality
[8:45:06] billdburr: can you show ure gear for a sec towelliee ? wanted to see how they changed prot pally gear
[8:45:24] Kuroii_Ck: wrath is all about raid logging KEKW
[8:45:26] misomander: a lot more to do means it doesnt have a shelf life
[8:45:27] Redshaman999: tap on pipeline?
[8:45:38] haveachub: WOTLK where was i had the most fun in the game.  Next was Pandaland
[8:45:46] SensationalBanana: MoP was when raiding began to be superb throughout. Thanks to LFR justifying the resources.
[8:45:49] istormragex: when is the release date of WOTLK ?
[8:45:58] Myndjestyr: "more to do" from a pve standpoint, single dungeon added this whole xpac
[8:46:30] Genius_Kappa: what i mostly loved was, that every class could provoke uniqueness in the Raid. Especially all the different buffs, from different classes.

[8:46:38] curated_: whats the flame shock buff, bonfire bless?
[8:46:41] Aquadriel: i started retail on early wotlk, but played previously a lot on private servers, as a good latin american player KEKW
[8:46:55] Hallacher: @Towelliee can you rank your top 4?
[8:47:14] keeindordel: @hotsexonaplat midsummer fire festival holiday event
[8:47:21] misomander: dungeons had the same loot from start to finish, you cant discredit m+
[8:47:29] shakmanne: wrath heroics are pretty fun, especially if you can slap the top dps
[8:47:48] Aquadriel: theres less dungeons but are way more replayable
[8:47:52] Valentino_R: to bcause u are not a solo player a regular
[8:48:02] Valentino_R: 9 to 5
[8:48:07] Waterrmaloon: Agrre
[8:48:08] curated_: oh yeah dope free dmg keeindordel
[8:48:20] shakmanne: I wish they would keep the dungeon finder for wrath though
[8:48:20] Funderik: more doesn't always mean better, if you have no reason to do the 10+ dungeons it's dead content. meaning it's really 0 dungeons
[8:48:36] SensationalBanana: One of the phrases I heard the most during WOTLK from friends, was; "I'm bored..."
[8:49:12] boomsitick: !alpha df
[8:49:12] Moobot: @boomsitick PREDICTION JULY 14th | WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-internal-alpha-now-on-blizzard-catalogue-327322 | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[8:49:20] SensationalBanana: Because after resets you had no reason to be in the world or in dungeons, you just did a few tasks and back to running around Dalaran it was.
[8:49:50] MaivGG: I did not play tbc, i should start leveling or is better to level in pre patch?
[8:50:01] NieIas: 10 am O_o
[8:50:21] LottoOne: what are you fav expansions in order towelliee? assuming your title is legit
[8:51:11] spookyfacegaming: I'm a little confused as to how the beta even has problems. Don't they have all of these files with all the art, characters etc? To me the only real testing that should be required is server stability and for people to test spells.
[8:51:13] Aquadriel: you only ran 1 dungeon daily for the daily quest, that's it.
[8:51:45] LottoOne: @edthedishevelednorwegian i dont think its as simple as a copy and paste
[8:51:54] Kriven: its not like they just load a floppy and it works
[8:52:07] NieIas: i believe they switched to SL engine in TBC classic
[8:52:12] generaljosh721: just plug in the USB drive and copy paste
[8:52:40] LottoOne: not to sound big headed or anything but just realized on june 2nd was my 10 years following you towelliee
[8:52:42] Balkep: @edthedishevelednorwegian you also need to update the code to the modern devices and OS, things like layering, modern QoL, etc
[8:52:46] j_bar111: ctrl-c ctrl-v 4Head
[8:52:54] Aquadriel: people think is like transfering your addon folder from your pc to your laptop KEKW
[8:52:58] 1Beal: They went pretty in depth at blizzcon 2018
[8:53:00] Kriven: is omar still there?
[8:53:04] generaljosh721: they hinted at it at some point. They basically created some converter class for all objects from the legacy infra to make it compatible with the new infra
[8:53:20] Aquadriel: like 6 months ago
[8:53:22] LottoOne: where did narmoon go lol
[8:53:27] vic_ave: he left right after Vanilla
[8:53:40] Aquadriel: i remember hearing around 6 months but you may be right.
[8:53:40] Tethyr: April 2021
[8:53:41] N3llee: he was gone when classic went live
[8:53:46] Theliahh: !wotlk
[8:53:46] Moobot: @Theliahh Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[8:53:51] Aquadriel: oh ok
[8:54:02] Aquadriel: covid timelines bro, messed up KEKW
[8:54:19] Kriven: frost giant did
[8:54:29] vic_ave: Stormgate?
[8:54:33] Aquadriel: thats frost giant
[8:54:44] Aquadriel: yeah that shit looked rough
[8:54:57] Aquadriel: gg, take care homie
[8:55:05] Atem___: like 73ish
[8:55:05] vic_ave: 74 75
[8:55:08] LarvCaramon: 73-76
[8:55:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: its next
[8:55:13] Ertra: 73-75 i think

[8:55:18] Duke_of_Haze: 71-74

[8:55:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: So much more mana
[8:55:55] LottoOne: i honstly loved seal twisting because it was unique but im kinda over it now
[8:56:08] precision79: wotlk paladin was the best i think (i hate holy power)
[8:56:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: same im tired of twisting lol
[8:56:24] 1Beal: I think this was the beginning of Procadin
[8:56:28] MFAM_THE_Steven: @precision79 Agreed!
[8:56:30] spookyfacegaming: @LottoOne Yeah, it got old fast for me. It was fun initially.
