[0:59:50] yujik46: @tvilk eh u dont rly lose that much playing statue as mw

[1:01:01] tvilk: If you CC them you can line up their jump so they use it at the same time
[1:01:09] tvilk: They WILL cast the ability on CD
[1:01:10] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe

[1:11:32] Nyrux: wait, can you put a statue in LOS

[1:13:47] Nightbot: LUL
[1:13:49] tvilk: yeah but the priest isn't watching stream and hasn't seen the clip
[1:14:01] HekticFox: only as quick as your slowest member :P
[1:14:07] nappingdwarf: just tell him to stay behind there and not move at all
[1:14:12] nappingdwarf: that is what Dorki did
[1:14:14] Goodstuffe: i always thought this was possible but thought it didnt work cus no one did it
[1:14:16] rxpx: just put mirrors outside and all stack in melee?
[1:14:17] nappingdwarf: listne the clip

[1:14:36] tvilk: ^thats the clip
[1:14:45] Axestro: Is he peeks out to heal they will insta leap and kill him.
[1:14:49] HekticFox: i dont think that pull is doable without beam + vdh + aug
[1:14:49] Nyrux: if you pull all you just die unless you coordinate everyting perfectly. its like 3 confessors and 3 augurs?
[1:14:49] tvilk: Healer stands behind the pillar and the jugs don't use the charge
[1:14:54] tvilk: scripe is now trying to teach the priest
[1:14:54] Nyrux: timer is free
[1:14:57] nappingdwarf: not tight at all
[1:15:08] nappingdwarf: 22 deaths can still time 30
[1:15:34] exodesus: @tvilk thank you <3
[1:15:41] tvilk: tbh the Augars are what will kill you in that pull even if you manage to do the los trick
[1:15:42] Axestro: Depends alot on pull size.

[3:36:47] IAmJoey: in 27 you dont need evoker
[3:36:47] nezquik123: i mean no evoker
[3:36:48] Exogenesis9: Problem with Evokers is mostly you get boosted evokers at this level.

[3:38:50] Faeynna: 27 vs 29 as well
[3:39:05] mohaso21: you cant compare it to a 29
[3:39:19] Exogenesis9: Potentially got Paladin nuking the small stuff much faster than boomie.
[3:39:45] IAmJoey: in 29 packs also last longer, but maybe they chain things into bosses as well
[3:40:14] Exogenesis9: I mean it's fire mage, you've got like 5 things in details total.

[4:05:02] tvilk: this is Tyrannical
[4:05:04] tvilk: not Fortified
[4:05:49] tvilk: but you can pull both and use the shield from the first guy to reduce dmg from the maiden
[4:06:12] mohaso21: there is many ways of doing the plattfrom
[4:06:16] tvilk: ye
[4:06:27] tvilk: read my message
[4:06:55] mohaso21: technically ye
[4:07:11] mohaso21: can you check a fort key instead

[4:11:12] mohaso21: idk
[4:11:23] tvilk: there's so many different things to do on this platform
[4:11:39] mohaso21: the ideal way i guess for you to let maiden kill adds with orbs i think
[4:11:50] tvilk: I prefer pulling the guy into maiden for the shield, but people don't stand in shield anyway
[4:12:32] mohaso21: there are groups where they minmax maidens orb
[4:12:36] mohaso21: and let it kill packs
[4:13:02] tvilk: if you're gonna let maiden stay alive for a long time, you need a good healer

[4:13:46] tvilk: its very easy for druid to heal
[4:13:53] tvilk: especially if you have aug in grp
[4:14:22] tvilk: the reason the snake is "efficient" is because he does 0 dmg so healer can pump dps too
[4:14:36] tvilk: in that clip the healer is casually pulling 100k dps
[4:15:18] mohaso21: i mean the mob cast the same abilities so ye it will cast it on mobs
[4:15:19] tvilk: he's dragonkin not humanoid, so i dont think you can mc
[4:15:21] mohaso21: but wont be same dmg
[4:15:32] mohaso21: but i dont think u can mind control it
