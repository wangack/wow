[2:35:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Work the bad juju
[2:35:17] Zeke_nl: i dont care who wins the race i just want both guilds pulling the same time at low percent
[2:35:41] Armdel: rip

[2:36:38] Armdel: im guessing friday or saturday kill, assuming its killable
[2:36:43] TiredCarcass: poor guys, likely out of clothes
[2:36:44] DudeInARobe: Soon as RWF is over, there will be a TON more nerfs incoming next Tuesday. For the general public to start clearing dudein3SHARINGAN

[2:38:22] smilylol_: Probs wasnt the easiest to tune this raid with double leggos and tier in regards to world first raiders that are seeing content 4 months before the normal "hardcore" raiding guild will see it
[2:38:27] Jarlan23: i thought trill and liquids tank was already gone
[2:38:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: 20 pages.....damn lol

[2:38:57] OvenMonkeyGaming: nah not yet
[2:39:00] AAPLisFascist: "How do we increase viewership?" "Let's overtune everything so that the race lasts forever"
[2:39:00] KragnosWoW: @OvenMonkeyGaming I might FeelsBadMan i hate pugging in mmos
[2:39:37] Traexler: More channels to watch tho, so maybe spread out more
[2:39:37] jkitchin75: are you not an alt tank for limit @Towelliee
[2:39:38] MrFuzzynuts420: is this gonna be the longest RWF?
[2:39:38] captivate7: I wonder if Lightee will tank in his place for now
[2:39:45] OvenMonkeyGaming: @JamesDaMan550 i know lol tiss a meme
[2:39:50] dalvynthedrunk: Well the start of the race was just clearing heroic with GIANT advertising asking for tier gear so I think a lot of people lost interest with that start lol
[2:39:53] CritcobainTV: i still need DoS for io :( fucking Sadge
[2:40:00] Valaurus: I've enjoyed the length purely because I'm sitting home working, but man over two weeks now, I can't imagine having to do that as a player
[2:40:01] captivate7: probably not
[2:40:01] Creative_Pigeon: problem is that no one wants to watch 5 days of splits in a 14 day race
[2:40:03] pereadin: Shakib could too.  He has a DK iirc
[2:40:06] AAPLisFascist: TBH it would have been the least viewed regardless of tuning
[2:40:21] CritcobainTV: i signed up for the DoS, but no invite :(
[2:40:42] stubs9: pretty sure Atlas is tanking, hes been watching scot the past couple of days
[2:40:43] OvenMonkeyGaming: i wanna dress as a dino already towRage
[2:40:58] Zeke_nl: liquid is flying in kungen to replace scott
[2:40:59] Jakmuiz: What do you think of shadowlands season 4?
[2:41:00] SD_Timbox: What is the countdown for?
[2:41:11] Traexler: If you just go by the whole wow category, you gotta take someone like asmo into account, is he streaming wow or not
[2:41:13] Jarlan23: max having his chat in sub mode constantly i dont think is doing any favors for his viewership tbh
[2:41:16] dalvynthedrunk: which is a shame because I think Sanctum from a viewer pov, was awful
[2:41:21] Zeke_nl: LUL
[2:41:29] Awesm_mossm: @towelliee last appeal though with a new expansion coming I think Warcraft still has more to offer than lost ark
[2:41:29] im_n0t_jezus: well if treated as an ESPORT if they have to go over 2 weeks is just like any world sport competition in a way
[2:41:34] Zeke_nl: kungen and athene 2man jailer
[2:41:34] mavericks312: my man is killing void lords already
[2:41:41] Scarhearth: I dont get the Kungen meme

[2:42:14] dalvynthedrunk: The Jailer was warning us that the cosmos divided cannot stand against Kungen
[2:42:14] CritcobainTV: One simply does not explain Kungen.

[2:42:20] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!

[2:43:01] Creative_Pigeon: for echo?
[2:43:07] dalvynthedrunk: I think the season 4 thing is dope, I am not gonna come back for it, but a cool step forward
[2:43:25] CritcobainTV: It's gonna be a shit show LUL

[2:43:42] Clay2K_: fuck it, just 4 legion dungeons
[2:43:43] MrFuzzynuts420: yeah i'm not crazy about Season 4. Just want 10.0 already

[2:44:02] dalvynthedrunk: 10.0 is farrr away tho
[2:44:10] pereadin: It should have been a legion throwback in my opinion since we all wish we had legion M+ back, but bring it back with the ability to use your artifact
[2:44:15] dalvynthedrunk: This isnt taking time from 10.0, its just giving people something to do for a long wait
[2:44:44] MrFuzzynuts420: Sadge
[2:44:45] darkdestroz: @Towelliee i wish they would bring back a reskin of the Cm mogs and weps with the Wod m+
[2:44:50] im_n0t_jezus: Sadge
[2:44:55] Zeke_nl: yeah def means 10.0 long time away
[2:45:00] dalvynthedrunk: idk I am tapped out of WoW until expansion reveal/release, as far as mmo goes I am on gw2 train
[2:45:03] pereadin: actually, no i recant that
[2:45:07] dalvynthedrunk: 10.0 will be 1h 2023 easily
[2:45:09] DudeInARobe: 10.0 will come out right before Microsoft takes over next summer
[2:45:10] pereadin: unfair to players who don't have artifact
[2:45:28] CritcobainTV: 😡
[2:45:29] AAPLisFascist: They make Mage tower permanent only to not give artifact mogs
[2:45:33] Jarlan23: i'd imagine artifact stuff wont be in, right?
[2:45:35] TSquadSully: TSquadSully subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months!

[2:46:03] CritcobainTV: He took the shaman over me cause lust Sadge

[2:49:34] DudeInARobe: Subscription every month won’t be game pass, but I could see the expansions be free on there @towelliee
[2:49:34] Contendedlemon: jsut taunt and line of sight the caster behind the pole white dps stun the casters
[2:49:35] bigbambooski: they would lose money

[2:49:48] SoryinTK: then los
[2:49:56] Awesm_mossm: @towelliee the only reason I see them doing that is to boost their numbers of players on Warcraft...if it comes to gamepass the population will jump
[2:50:01] SoryinTK: ye
[2:50:12] dalvynthedrunk: I legit had someone tell me that LAs ccu numbers weren't impressive because at one point "WoW had 12 million" just shows that some of these folk have no idea what these numbers mean LUL
[2:50:13] pereadin: you LoS pull the priest

[2:51:59] AAPLisFascist: MS just wants Call of Duty, Blizzard is some 1+1 promotion
[2:52:01] DudeInARobe: Subscription not on game pass, expansions on game pass every year. My guess/opinion on how they utilize it at least
[2:52:02] Miklagard: I'd settle for a good expansion CorgiDerp
[2:52:04] Impendngdoom: its simple, they bought them at a discount
[2:52:04] Tanidalas: I could see like a Gamepass + Wow sub plan
[2:52:05] Lostdogal: I believe
[2:52:08] sircheex: honestly know m$ business plan it wouldnt be crazy. they dont care about taking losses if it brings subscribers
[2:52:34] sircheex: it's about the 5-10 year plan to be the #1 game platform so they can set the prices they want then
[2:52:38] Shadowlemur01: @Miklagard true
[2:52:39] larualis: Im honestly waiting till next xpac to come back to wow. Im sure the games fun right now but lost arks ruining my life right now
[2:52:46] Awesm_mossm: u know Phil Spencer has something on the plate for Warcraft either being gamepass related or coming to console...he won't rest on the best MMO to date to capitalize on it being part of Microsoft now
[2:52:59] AAPLisFascist: Tab targeting in gamepad sounds like a nightmare
[2:53:15] dalvynthedrunk: Same, nothing they can do for SL will make me really want to play, ill be back for the next xpac for sure, until then, gw2 and other games
[2:53:21] VinnyOG: why? tabbed targeting sounds like a gamepad feature
[2:53:22] mavericks312: WoW on console will be horrendous
[2:53:56] neveranyluck: microsoft cant even touch blizzard until later this year or beginning of next yr.
[2:54:02] Awesm_mossm: why? final fantasy works on console and there is a crap ton of buttons there too
[2:54:05] Shadowlemur01: WoW is completely dependent on addons. it will not come to console
[2:54:09] valys83: WoW would be really hard to port to console unless 10.0 completely revamps the skill system to make fewer buttons
[2:54:11] LosDuervo: For those wondering what MS will do with WoW, look at what they've done with ESO for some hints.
[2:54:24] HigameR4771: <3
[2:54:32] dalvynthedrunk: Wow is a much bigger cash cow than ESO
[2:54:33] valys83: Lost Ark could work on console, GW2 could work on console, too. But not WoW
[2:54:41] BrotherBeezy: raizFine raizFine raizFine
[2:54:50] pereadin: I don't understand how people don't understand this dungeon and the affixes by now
[2:54:53] DudeInARobe: @losduervo ESO isn’t addon dependent like console is now. They’d need to change some interface stuff around.
[2:54:54] Blvdman: not in our life times :P
[2:54:54] Xirmak: ummmm just make a new WoW, unreal engine 5, release it and the fan boys will drool over it regardless of platform
[2:54:54] AureliusXV: no one from console will be invited

[2:55:44] Blvdman: console could barely do world quests lol
[2:55:45] Xirmak: ESO does that.... console plays with console pc with pc
[2:55:49] Awesm_mossm: @neveranyluck u kidding me? wow is so outdated the new consoles can easily run this game
[2:55:50] 24sevn: console players can only play the hunter class
[2:56:00] AAPLisFascist: Wait till blizzard gives console exclusive buffs and built in DBM
[2:56:04] 24sevn: and tank
[2:56:09] MoonwalkingAngel: eso has only 5 button skills
[2:56:14] neveranyluck: @Awesm_mossm im not talking about graphics there genius
[2:56:17] mavericks312: @Awesm_mossm your forgetting how addon heavy wow is
[2:56:37] DaltonIRL: Yeah how would addons work on console? Do I gott plug in my flash drive like I did for all my music back on the xbox 360 days LUL
[2:56:56] pereadin: dps in the group is really low
[2:56:56] UhOhCoreo: Is Buffbean in a guild? need a boomkin
[2:56:57] MoonwalkingAngel: ff14 is great for controller but it was also designed for it
[2:56:58] Xirmak: @a_angel_in_distress also a back bar flip so it is 12 in total. different combat system.... you actually have to aim
[2:57:12] dalvynthedrunk: FFXIV also has a giga long gcd so gamepad support is easier
[2:57:18] Awesm_mossm: @mavericks312 still the memory and shit in the series x could keep up...the console is better than most computers that ran wow back in burning crusade days or even wrath days
[2:57:27] Blvdman: whats the enh playing then if he isnt nf?
[2:57:35] Scarhearth: necrolord likely

[2:57:46] RhawrBerry: what is the boomy?
[2:57:48] VinnyOG: you guys talk about consoles like they're not medium form factor x86 computers that are better than half the wow playerbases PC's
[2:57:50] LosDuervo: MS didn't make ESO cross-platform. It was like that before MS bought Bethesda. I'm talking about expansion/sub/etc. MS didn't do anything to that stuff. You still have to buy ESO expansions. Still have to sub if you want the stuff that gets you. So it's likely not gonna happen with WoW at all.
[2:57:50] Scarhearth: Necrolord enhance is insanely strong when played correctly
[2:57:52] mavericks312: @Awesm_mossm could it run on consoles sure but the way WoW is played now wouldnt work for consoles
[2:57:55] UhOhCoreo: probably venth
[2:58:02] BrotherBeezy: They really need to push up the date to convert set pieces.

[2:58:27] larualis: People need to think of dungeons as you need to deal x damage in this time across everything in the dungeon
[2:58:27] mavericks312: nest week
[2:58:28] AureliusXV: 10

[2:58:47] mavericks312: week 8 right?
[2:59:10] UhOhCoreo: warrior is getting bodied by the sexy druid on bosses tho
[2:59:15] neveranyluck: its not about the graphics. the server loads along would melt an xbox
[2:59:33] VinnyOG: good thing they're not hosting the servers on xboxes?
[2:59:34] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[2:59:41] VinnyOG: what?
[2:59:44] TurboXttv: Yup. Agreed with the dude above. Druid bodied warrior.
[2:59:51] ijaaxxz: BRROOOO My Car wont start this morning beacuse of some bs Nissan Anti Theft Immoiblizer shit that activated some how
[3:00:15] doomester: @Towelliee you need to play NF, its been discussed in Brew discord
[3:00:15] Awesm_mossm: all I'm saying is Microsoft ha finally being doing shit right this generation and that they will possibly find a way to implement WoW the biggest game over the past 18 years plus...u can agree or not agree they are making positive moves for sure
[3:00:25] LosDuervo: true
[3:00:28] dalvynthedrunk: yeah shutup about MS people focus on what matters, 10.0 reveal in just a few weeks
[3:00:34] VinnyOG: @ijaaxxz google "reset nissan anti theft system"
[3:00:41] Dathas487: It's definitely not allowed, but the idea that there weren't "assurance" deals made in handshakes when the acquisition deal went off isn't too crazy imo
[3:00:43] ijaaxxz: ya i done all that
[3:00:59] ijaaxxz: think my Key Fob got deactiaved some how
[3:00:59] mavericks312: the deal still has to be approved yet
[3:01:11] Xirmak: Right... it is a process. Microsoft comes in, just sits and watches. show us what you do and how you do it and in 6 months to a year we will say here is what we think moving forward
[3:01:16] VinnyOG: did you wait the whole 15+ minutes after walking away 10+ feet?
[3:01:21] Blvdman: the expansion reveal better contain info on how they plan to do systems in the future

[3:02:07] Deadcells: Towellii wake me up
[3:02:09] Xirmak: systems in the future.... step 1: get rid of them. step 2: get your story arc straight and not scrap the good stuff
[3:02:18] VinnyOG: @ijaaxxz if the reset directions don't work(make sure you follow them to a T), try disconnecting the positive terminal for 2 minutes
[3:02:21] UhOhCoreo: I'm not sure who munieshot is but they're making great points about how good the druid is.
[3:02:58] Deadcells: Toweliee excuse my spelling I tired
[3:03:23] Blvdman: @Xirmak people paid attention to story this time round cuz gameplay was dogshit. lol

[3:05:40] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee i feel so naked without LA. im sitting here Peepo smiling watching you play WoW while waiting
[3:05:43] Nuggetttss: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:06:18] UhOhCoreo: Can you tell me what guild the druid is in I wanna check out their toon
[3:06:20] Deadcells: I’m not flexing. I want to be home playing WoW but I’m at work 😭
[3:06:34] ItsBorland: fuck the story lol
[3:06:35] dalvynthedrunk: I think any new system in 10.0 needs to be HORIZONTAL and GAME-WIDE. Essentially yoink masteries from gw
[3:06:36] ItsBorland: make the game fun
[3:06:37] doomester: @Towelliee im hyped for alliance quueing with horde
[3:06:46] KonaWolfeee: People who think the story makes it what it is is hilarious. Blizzard is dog shit at story telling LMAO
[3:06:47] ijaaxxz: yeah they need to make the Game more Indepth and stop Gutting Classes
[3:06:51] Daveedium: people will complain about systems and borrowed power but say classic is too boring
[3:06:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the majority of players don't care much about the details of the story
[3:06:52] Blvdman: gameplay is where its at, only reason  story was loud this xpac was cuz gameplay was dogshit so nothing else to do lol
[3:06:57] mavericks312: look at liquid and echo none of them care about the lore just the raid bosses
[3:07:00] ijaaxxz: Classes used to have so much more Utility and Abilites
[3:07:00] LosDuervo: moon guard peeps probably care. that's about it
[3:07:06] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee look at lost ark. no one gives a shit about the story. gameplay is amazing. game succeed's
[3:07:10] SK1NFATHER: if gameplay was as fun as Lost Ark, i'd have zero problem whatsoever with WoW
[3:07:11] Dathas487: The Season 4 raid changes are definitely a step in the right direction - just wished they picked raids that we literally didn't just finish doing.
[3:07:15] ijaaxxz: and now Classes are gutted to 6-7 abilities
[3:07:21] AAPLisFascist: Wow worked fine without all the borrowed power though, just design classes well
[3:07:22] ItsBorland: I bet I'm not the only one but man Lost ark combat has spoiled me and this game feels meh even after years of playing it compared to one month of LA
[3:07:29] tumb_tack: tumb_tack subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[3:07:39] KonaWolfeee: @BorlandBTW i whole heartedly agree
[3:07:41] ijaaxxz: just feel like WoW Got seriously Dumbed down over the years
[3:07:59] KonaWolfeee: after palying LA on release i come back to WoW and feel like im playing a MSW95 game lol
[3:08:06] mavericks312: @ijaaxxz the correct term is casualized
[3:08:10] AAPLisFascist: I wish Blizz just put all the efforts into class and talent design and scrap all the borrowed power nonsense
[3:08:15] ItsBorland: hah very true
[3:08:17] KonaWolfeee: ^
[3:08:22] chambiann: @ijaaxxz Yet you have to play so much better now, compared to years ago
[3:08:29] ItsBorland: excited for ranked today

[3:08:34] ItsBorland: pvp is fun in LA
[3:08:35] PokerFaceMoose: does lost ark do 8 hour maintenance every week?
[3:08:37] KonaWolfeee: @ijaaxxz what are you on about lol. every class has like 4 buttons
[3:08:45] GnarlyDavidson: I miss playing wow
[3:08:46] UhOhCoreo: LA stinks
[3:08:50] Imolate_: @ijaaxxz in what aspect of the game? lol
[3:08:51] chambiann: @Norgrin_ watching a wow stream, sooo lies?
[3:08:51] ItsBorland: @PokerFaceMoose usually 4
[3:08:55] ijaaxxz: i dont think its about playing better when most rotations are 3-4 buttons
[3:09:01] Blvdman: LA pvp atm is imbalanced
[3:09:02] UhOhCoreo: garbage game for garbage people
[3:09:04] BlackRe3per: !LA
[3:09:04] Moobot: @BlackRe3per https://www.playlostark.com/en-us/news/articles/march-24-weekly-update-2022
[3:09:15] PokerFaceMoose: @BorlandBTW thanks
[3:09:22] Xirmak: The problem with current WoW... at least it seems.... is that they are designing the game backwards. It feels like it is being designed from whatever new raid is and then on down to where you start. We all agree in MMO land WoW has the best raids hands down. Currently, that is all that is has and excels at compared to others
[3:09:24] chambiann: @ijaaxxz when was it ever more than 3-4 buttons?
[3:09:32] ItsBorland: hah thats fair
[3:09:34] ijaaxxz: thats what i mean Classes used to have so many more skills and abilities to use like Arms warriors Banners Heroic Throws all that stuff got taken out
[3:09:34] nekcihc1989: any1 know covenant for resto shaman?
[3:09:39] CuddlyWuddly: @UhOhCoreo who shat in your food?
[3:09:41] N3llee: good morning..
[3:09:48] Blvdman: gunlancer is the one with the long pole and shield right?
[3:09:50] zelkura: when is LA comming back up?
[3:09:54] SK1NFATHER: a little too combo-y for me. Lots of zero-to-death mechanics in LA pvp
[3:10:04] N3llee: man this RWF is so close
[3:10:04] dpbdagger: !wow10

[3:10:05] dalvynthedrunk: WoW also has the best dungeon system in mmos, basically Wow is the best bet for instanced content
[3:10:05] Jeffinite1y: I think in 45 minutes
[3:10:08] Zansteh: @CuddlyWuddly LUL LUL
[3:10:12] Armdel: isn't it technically still the beginning of the game for Lost Ark though
[3:10:12] Blvdman: pretty sure top 30 pvp is gunna be gun lancer lol
[3:10:17] Blvdman: those shields are insane
[3:10:20] PokerFaceMoose: @Blvdman yeah/ the pole is the gunlance
[3:10:26] UhOhCoreo: @CuddlyWuddly sorry champ its just a shit game.
[3:10:29] zelkura: @deathjeff98_  thanks mate
[3:10:32] ijaaxxz: PvP would feel better in Lost Ark for me if i wasn't perma stunned locked to death by ranged classes as a Melee Class
[3:10:44] KonaWolfeee: WoW PVP is easier for sure but LA is just.. weird. im tier 1 waiting for ranked today and im quite decent but you cant deny if youre stunned youre fucked. a bit odd to me but im getting sued to it
[3:10:46] ItsGlime: @Towelliee if i buy a 60boost in wow, do you know if i'd have to redo korthia/maw/tower again?
[3:10:46] KonaWolfeee: used*
[3:10:56] zevaz177: nameplate add-on?
[3:10:58] Blvdman: ijaaxxz melee has it good, depending on whom you face
[3:10:58] chambiann: @Norgrin_ who is playing wow right now, aka wow stream
[3:11:01] ItsBorland: @ijaaxxz just trinket 4Head Kappa
[3:11:07] ijaaxxz: lol
[3:11:25] Blvdman: if LA pvp had aerial trinket would be nice
[3:11:27] Nuggetttss: Prot pally doesn't seem to bad this season.
[3:11:33] Blvdman: some classes keeping u juggled in air
[3:11:33] KonaWolfeee: @ijaaxxz yeah im still getting used to it. gotta use the map strat of going top or bot so the other team doesnt see you on their screens
[3:11:40] pereadin: normal urn pull next

[3:11:58] ijaaxxz: they need to make it so like you only have 1-2 stun lock skills
[3:12:04] ItsBorland: hardest thing for LA pvp is the fov stuff imo
[3:12:06] Elementlolz1: do you have 4p tier?
[3:12:08] KonaWolfeee: funny enough my pally hybrid build fucking smacks in LA PVP. i get like 6-7 kills per match and have insane heal up time on teammates
[3:12:18] KonaWolfeee: @BorlandBTW i abuse the shit out of it
[3:12:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah an hour

[3:12:51] Ryetta: an hour feels like 24 hour when lost ark is down so yea @Towelliee
[3:12:53] zelkura: im just excited for the new ways to get matts and a pvp vendor, yessirrr
[3:12:59] ItsBorland: @KonaWolfee I force 21:9 in pve and pvp lol
[3:13:02] ItsBorland: I just got used to it
[3:13:04] ItsBorland: dont mind it
[3:13:20] dalvynthedrunk: I really wish Anet would share their secrets on how they manage to have no maintenance or downtime ever for their servers
[3:13:22] KonaWolfeee: @BorlandBTW does it looks weird for your screen ? i assume it isnt native so you got like black bars and shit right?

[3:17:24] ItsBorland: @KonaWolfee you're def right lmfao but I think they obviously meant just another casual way to obtain more mats. They worded it weird for sure tho
[3:17:26] Ophase: I'm not sure I see how its ultimately unfortunate for people who swipe? They're able to use the same materials they're receiving for free towards continuing to upgrade. I'm not sure waiting to swipe would have "saved" you money if you decided to wait.
[3:17:34] KonaWolfeee: @BorlandBTW ahhhhh
[3:17:35] Deadcells: I have been playing wow hardcore since December which is the first expansion I have played like this since Cata. I have too much to do in WoW to catch up to play lost ark
[3:17:38] ItsBorland: Like those raids will be free
[3:17:46] ItsBorland: literally free mats
[3:17:59] Ophase: Ophase subscribed with Prime.

[3:18:17] ItsBorland: he might fuck some people KEKW
[3:18:29] KonaWolfeee: @Ophase not at all what i stated lol. but in terms of me as a swiper. you save money now due to greaters being nowhere near 800 gold per after the update. more injections = massive tank in AH as everyone panic sells. economy 101
[3:18:57] KonaWolfeee: @Norgrin_ we wont know until next year
[3:18:58] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco

[3:22:47] Ophase: @KonaWolfee I'm just trying to understand. Isn't the economy directly tied to gems? So you're buying power isn't really "greater" by waiting. Maybe I'm not understanding the Lost Ark market completely.
[3:22:55] genovis1: Enh is really easy to learn but hard to master
[3:23:00] KonaWolfeee: @BorlandBTW this will be our first time doing p2 so we probably gonna wipe a shit ton. theres a lot of stagger checks in p2
[3:23:05] Bombaklats: trundle is being a pain it seems ;p
[3:23:12] ItsBorland: yeah p2 looks like a bitch
[3:23:21] ItsBorland: good luck though
[3:23:41] ItsBorland: ill be slamming my desk in ranked due to bards and paladins Kappa
[3:23:51] KonaWolfeee: @BorlandBTW not to mention 1 person from group one having to stop damage and every so often go to edge of map and tell group 2 on the bottom what phase is happening . Towliee will have to be the one to check since we all watch stream while playing
