Remember, our line has always ruled with wisdom, and strength. And I know that you will show restraint, when exercising your great power. But the truest victory, my son, is stirring the hearts of your people. I tell you this, for when my days have come to and end. You, shall be king.

[4:19:40] sassay97: dk has brez to ?

[4:20:24] blastibator: explains it
[4:20:25] BensLodge: the only ppl who dont enjoy classic are those still waiting for a beta key
[4:20:32] TexiWoW: i dont like BFA very much, but M+ is rly good tbh _
[4:20:33] DeonnTheVerdictlizer: @Lazelfan1999 1999 they literally made retail for your age kids LUL easy and braindead gameplay

[4:21:20] Hollow1nside: @Deonn I mean, let's be honest, it's not like Vanilla had 200 IQ gameplay either. Most of it was brianless grinding.
[4:21:25] JhonAlx1: shakibCOMFY shakibCOMFY shakibCOMFY

[5:01:01] NovaXaylos: @Pulsarite Your exact words just a few minutes ago was "it's the same company". It's not Blizzard anymore. It's Activision Blizzard. And all they're doing is repurposing an old game to a new client. They're not developing anything with it. And they have a lot of hate because they've been pretty bad the last few years about a lot of stuff, most recently firing a lot of employees and even having people make the choice to leave the company ON THEIR OWN.

[5:10:52] NovaXaylos: @Pulsarite I wasn't at all aggressive. It was just completely wrong information. And when Classic comes out, BFA will lose a ton of players. It's by far the weakest expansion they've released so far, and they needed a huge hail mary like 8.2 to even try to bring it back. Chances are they release 8.2, get people for a month, and then they get their sub numbers back when people come back for Classic in August. But most people will definitely NOT play both. I would guess at release 70% of the playe

[6:20:42] Ralem_: @Hydrixi No private server ever had over 100k active players. Any server that gave a number higher than that was blatantly lying.

[6:21:00] Saturnda: @ExPeacer_ Because I like LUL ing BFA like everybody on TWITCH, its tradition
[6:21:07] Hydrixi: @Venrai no one would actually play private servers if there were servers up, LOL. you remember who played private servers back int he day? people who only wanted to have GM abilities

[6:21:38] MissAvantasia: @tranqo Milk? So you mean the viewers don't have their own free will and choice? :p
[6:21:39] Rusty_Plastic: Classic is gonna be more fun because bfa is sucha grind and be good to just focus on game mechanics again

[6:22:26] angeleyed: How does nerf hold a two hand?
[6:22:29] voshmek: @Tranqo well tbh it feels like there is nothing to do in BfA content wise... since once you get to around 415 Ilvl (which isn't that hard) you can't really get higher easily... and vanilla is just different
[6:22:31] MasterKjn: nerfclap = NA pug getting hit by shadow smash LUL
[6:22:32] zero_peach: @Rick_Astley86 you understand NA in winning this dungeon ???

[6:22:45] Saturnda: @leya1337 when CLASSIC will have 500k viewers from EVERY MAJOR streamer in the world on launch day you will see who is braindead
[6:22:46] Raggu2: It’s strategy. Reduce your max hp so explosives don’t matter.
[6:22:48] SinfulBishop: ahhhh rip
[6:22:52] lazelele: @SinfulBishop some priest artifact that everyone can mog into
[6:22:53] Hydrixi: @Ralem_ On ONE server. imagine that. One LUL
[6:22:54] TheHolyPacman: bfa is casino with slight rpg elements
[6:23:03] MetabolikTV: MNA playing smart
[6:23:04] Hydrixi: @Ralem_ How many are on a Blizzard server? 20k ?
[6:23:07] SinfulBishop: cause it looks hella cool

[6:23:07] Rick_STL: @zero_peach PogChamp
[6:23:10] voshmek: @Tranqo vanilla is far more dungeons & dragons like game, since the leveling matters and even the gear while leveling matters
[6:23:11] Vuda_: @Raggu2 smart Pog
[6:23:17] ExPeacer_: @voshmek are you 415 ilvl? do you do mythic raiding/glad pvp/15+ m+s?
[6:23:20] aloneinlight: Nah reaped soul isn't matter not explosive
[6:23:26] leya1337: @Saturnda who cares about release day? the raiding was so easy in classic, it was only hard to find 40 people and organize it.
[6:23:27] lazelele: yeah its called darkened t'uure

[6:23:33] dolby24j: @Saturnda nobody cares mate. Everyone knows you gonna play classic because you are always saying the same thing. Nobody cares

[6:28:27] jorzynu: @Saturnda no matter how much you def these 2 streamer fanboys, if you ever wanted to earn something in Vanilla, you must spent like 10 times more time in BFA, maybe 100-200 people to do that, but the rest 99% gonna burn out
[6:28:28] VanDiemenStudio: unfortunately thats the way the internet rolls in Australia :(

[6:28:35] Ralem_: @Hydrixi Ofc it'll be huge, for a month or two, then it'll lose 70% of it's players that just jumped on the bandwagon; just like all games do. And possibly even more 'coz of streamers bringing in people that never actually played vanilla.

[6:29:55] Skylinex: any NaM ers in the chat
[6:29:56] Jicsa: there are more things besides internet conection that can cause your game to close / stop
[6:29:57] Saturnda: @jorzynu Asmongold TEARED UP when classic launched, can you imagine that he can ACT so good to CRY? It takes YEARS of training to cry on demand
[6:29:58] Sgt_SadSack: Because wow isn’t run on LAN...
[6:29:59] namedaccount: how is that warrior using a 2h weapon as a 1h with shield?
[6:30:00] omgyoloo: everyone please tell me more how you like bfa better than classic - or the other way around LUL
[6:30:02] Ralem_: @Hydrixi In that data Nost said they had 150k people that still "came back to the server", which means nothing.
[6:30:02] Misa_x_Misa: esl has tournaments in aus all the time and somehow internet isn't the issue..

[6:30:58] chimmtv: SMOrc
[6:30:58] forever_tilted: wake me up when BC servers release ResidentSleeper
[6:31:02] Ralem_: @Hydrixi Classic might have more players for a while, but in the long run there's 0 chance it'll have more than retail. People are too attached to their accounts and you significantly underestimate the amount of casuals that have no interest in vanilla but still wanna get the enjoyment they get out of retail.
[6:31:03] nxckolai: @paragorr items, “Drums of Fury” , “Drums of the Mountain”
[6:31:04] Hydrixi: @Banshee_GG I think that's a weak stance. I am leaning toward the opposite stance. I argue it's completely true what I said
[6:31:12] each_and_everything: why does anyone play this ?????? wake me up when classic comes 8/27/2019

[6:44:53] lilchica4: Will we see NA choke on this boss again? :-P
[6:44:53] Halinn: I hope they'll try to do this with real dungeons, like full BRD or Maraudon runs in Classic
[6:44:54] carnix96: yes but for classic to play u need bfa subs so its fine on paper more player for bfa xD
[6:44:55] Saryero: @Saturnda you think just because the vocal minority is LUL'ing bfa its the entire viewerbase agreeing with them?
[6:44:56] zllak: guys, if you are classic fanbois and BFA haters, just leave ?
[6:44:59] MasterKjn: 40k = typical NA pug depleting a 19 key haHAA

[6:45:20] cjayen: @MasterKjn they´re eu????
[6:45:22] Ganddtv: in classic, grinding actually means something, why even play BFA? Just get a titanforge from LFR or WQ lol

[6:54:49] Ralem_: @Saturnda God, you're so naive and unable to see the full picture. Twitch is a drop of water in the ocean in the gaming industry. A game that has 10m players might only get 20k viewers on twitch. And Ninja's effect on Apex was insignificant considering and the game is dead right now.

[7:04:33] NinnooMP: TBH why do casuals think, taht classic will hit us like a bomb? Yes it has many viewers on Twitch (guess what, Blizzard pay' em for playing classic). Classic was great caused by the Community u had in Classic. The community has massively changed since then and the Community like it is now, wont work with classic. so after 2-3 Month Classic will b rekt. Stop hype it just cause there are many Viewers - cuz it's nonsense tho. And tbhj the wow community is the most critic community and loves to quit
[7:04:33] TodPide: @Saturnda maybe for a few specs but not the majority, also literally nothing is worse than classic, mage is literally 1 button spam....
