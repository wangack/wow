[2:25:20] dooshken: hahaha
[2:25:22] muddafakkaaaa: hey, do you think we will see notable inflation in shuffle as well toward the end of the season or is that something that generally only happens in 3s?
[2:25:46] dooshken: samiFinger
[2:26:02] Zartirian: shuffle is even more deflated than real 3s atm
[2:26:08] Cybernytez: yes
[2:26:16] iggy_pls: yeah its Verdant Legend this season
[2:26:17] ryanblue98: verdant legened title
[2:26:18] domz_i: Legend

[2:26:28] Zartirian: crimson legend, obsidian legend, verdant legend
[2:26:42] chinchin23: much point though?
[2:26:58] masterpaave: Pretty cool titles
[2:27:04] chinchin23: yeah solo shuffle feels like the reward is a bit meh
[2:27:35] Cybernytez: on pvp check it says you have a R1 solo shuffle title ^^
[2:27:36] Zartirian: rn the top 5 pres get title, ur 5th, top is 2653cr 40 above u
[2:27:38] iggy_pls: solo shuffle got me banned for 7 days LUL
[2:27:38] chinchin23: yeah but you have already completed the highest achive in the game winning blizzcon
[2:27:38] dooshken: skirmishes is being generous
[2:28:08] zakdubya: it doesnt count towards ur 2
[2:28:15] Cybernytez: the dew was R1 in shuffle already and he doesnt even know it kekw
[2:28:32] Happylat: Cdew what do you think of macros that does "too much" like Pika made a video of it
[2:28:46] beepboopx9: its mostly used for PVE so when you die you dnt lose food buff
[2:28:49] chinchin23: when does season end ?
[2:28:50] D_E_I: @Cybernytez true kEkW
[2:28:50] Fraple: it's just that it persists through death so it's really good for M+ and progression

[2:29:02] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[2:29:07] Cybernytez: Idk on what class but when i check you you have 1 R1 in shuffle ^^
[2:30:01] chinchin23: macro i dont consider it cheating though its what you figure out in the game i think its  chad macro
[2:30:36] rocif40: is this legandary streamer pikachu
[2:30:43] igniteorbit2: what would you say is best class to heal on
[2:30:59] Jcres54: i feel like trying to land that accurately on the move would be harder than just standing and doing it with dummies, no?
[2:31:06] D_E_I: so it's basically just a ranged kick KEKW Shaman been doing that every 6 seconds for 20 years OMEGALUL
[2:31:11] Happylat: but it allows a developer to build insane macros i guess
[2:31:13] Fraple: using all your mobility in a swifty macro
[2:31:13] chinchin23: you adding buttons to an already insane rotation as well
[2:31:23] Jcres54: ahhhh ok
[2:31:37] igniteorbit2: also curious on your opinion on mw currently because i feel like ive hit a wall on mw
[2:32:00] Cybernytez: you probably had R1 on your pres in shuffle because he was the highest rated
[2:32:01] CabinetMistake: like how it saves the cursor for the grapple after the stepkick
[2:32:03] chinchin23: its because of having no globals
[2:32:06] beepboopx9: im not 2 skill of gcd and then one that is on
[2:32:10] Happylat: thanks for your take :)
[2:33:13] igniteorbit2: can i ask why you dont think mw is good currently, im fairly new to wow and my boys set me up with mw

[3:16:48] Hydrixi: Lot of Druids and Hunters here
[3:17:02] Cybernytez: @igniteorbit2 if u have fun then keep plaing them ^^ dont listen to ppl saying its bad ^^ skill matters more thatn meta. especially in shuffle because you just compete against ur own spec
[3:17:24] rocif40: o7
[3:17:37] igniteorbit2: @Cybernytez every game i play i wanna be good thats the only reason i worry about meta so much

[3:20:24] WutFace_VS_KrippO: ret breaking full trap
[3:20:28] Cybernytez: @igniteorbit2 idk what to tell you than i just told you ^^ xd if u wanna win at all cost then play always meta but you need the practice on that classes so will be hard to always play meta
[3:20:30] JBugaboo: cdru is such a dope name man
[3:20:58] igniteorbit2: @Cybernytez no im hearing ya im just talking thats all, i get what youre saying for sure
[3:21:17] brewtank: yet you play dps all the time LOL
[3:21:22] TheUlaine: I think Cyclone needs to be really bad, but that's just my opinion lol.
[3:21:24] ripinpeace10: its nuts that druids can just spam cyclone in ur face on every teammate its so trash
[3:21:24] BurntMrWaffles: what about putting it on stun dr?
[3:21:32] brewtank: yea
[3:21:41] beepboopx9: @ripinpeace10 costs a lot of mana as rdru
[3:21:43] WutFace_VS_KrippO: i bet its one of those guy who has 1 turtle and can't press it
[3:21:48] reavethederp: hunter free Sadge
[3:22:01] igniteorbit2: @Cybernytez i enjoy mw for sure so im prolly gonna focus on it but was just curious why people think its no good
[3:22:04] dooshken: following since 2014 just to make stupid commentsl ike that lol
[3:22:27] beepboopx9: cant heal as dru if kicked on clone
[3:22:45] ripinpeace10: you cna kick clone all u want they just recast it after 4 seconds lol
[3:22:50] ripinpeace10: nothing you can do
[3:23:20] Cybernytez: @igniteorbit2 well its not the best healer ATM but its capable of winning if you play well ^^ ofc you wont win as much as if you do the same on a current meta healer

[3:24:12] igniteorbit2: @Cybernytez prolly a dumb question but i dont know the ins and outs, and no one has been able to give me a straight answer, what about mw is less optimal compared to other classes
[3:24:53] igniteorbit2: @Cybernytez you can also just tell me to shut up lol ive been asking you a lot of questions
[3:24:54] Cybernytez: @igniteorbit2 im not a mW expert ^^ this is a qusstion for the dewland he may have an answer :P
[3:25:01] beepboopx9: @igniteorbit2 mw is just not as good as rdru and rsham right now. it will be some other season but at the moment is just does not oputput in the meta like the S+ healers
[3:25:31] ryanblue98: @beepboopx9 mw has never been S tier
[3:25:38] beepboopx9: yes it has lol

[3:36:16] beepboopx9: as a caster mw you really just want to be looking at the kick ratio. like if there a million kicks and only you as a caster feels bad
