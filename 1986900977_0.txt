[1:31:45] Ellie_Stark_: @Bigschmoike My mistake, not bug. Intended design. It is said that your hunter is playing dead - holding their breath while feigning death so holding breath during duration of feign death for so long causes them to actually die

[5:41:34] AlisaeRae: I must have been to places that didn't do that monkaHmm
[5:41:41] TheSolree: @doctor_mav rarely I'd say and you can refuse danKEK2
[5:41:46] tedstickel: just the tip
[5:42:10] doctor_mav: I think I heard it from the only IRL person I know that visited the US
[5:42:12] NightJams: usually gratuity is only added to a bill if its a really big party
[5:42:13] CptTeempo: danD
[5:42:34] erina_plays: @doctor_mav that person is very wrong danLUL
[5:42:41] Jane_Denton: @RushingHook danGasp
[5:42:53] Insanefrenzy: I honestly can't remember the last time a place had gratuity included on the bill
[5:42:54] TheSolree: @doctor_mav in my visits I didn't encounter that. There might be "this is how much a tip would be based on how much you spent" but that's about it
[5:42:58] Shadow_WS6: yeah and alot of places if you order it for take out try to push for tips but its not manditory
[5:42:59] bunoboosted: are we allowed to warn him?
[5:43:01] BlankArkadian: danOMG
[5:43:18] doctor_mav: Maybe they scammed my friend FeelsBadMan
[5:43:23] BlankArkadian: monkaS
[5:43:26] bunoboosted: @DansGaming don't go on the ships. You can easily aggro the whole ship and can't get out with the water.
[5:43:40] AlisaeRae: @bunoboosted What no the ships are safe

[5:43:51] EriSeidr: Most of the time they'll mention on the menu that gratuity is added to the bill for large orders.
[5:43:52] TheSolree: Why not? Do you have sea sickness? danKappa

[5:45:14] TheSolree: @doctor_mav everyone is. Why wouldn't that be so? danKEK
[5:45:27] Mario_JE: tips are "optional" and by that I mean if you don't tip you're ostracized from US
[5:45:27] heavymetalhorns: @doctor_mav If you go to a sit-down restaurant where you are served food, odds are the waitstaff are making like $2.65 an hour... so just expect to tip
[5:45:32] TheSolree: @Jane_Denton danCult danKnife
[5:45:38] Jane_Denton: @TheSolree danGasp

[5:46:15] tedstickel: expecting and getting are two different things.
[5:46:19] dj_mafia: getting risky now danS
[5:46:22] heavymetalhorns: @AlisaeRae Yeah here in the richest country on earth, corporate overlords decided to outsource paying their employees to the general public
[5:46:29] Brandance: @thesolree same danWokege
[5:46:39] Minatec: @DansGaming any plans for the new poe league?
[5:46:41] smashlord4000: @heavymetalhorns not even 3.50?
[5:46:45] shadows_embrace_you: Is Dan up to snuff again?
[5:46:49] AlisaeRae: @heavymetalhorns Yea but that's below state and federal minimum wage, how does that work lol
[5:47:08] LeBigNose: last snuff peepoClap
[5:47:17] doctor_mav: @TheSolree Because I don't think there's many other countries out there with that sort of tipping culture ne0ndaFeelsBad
[5:47:19] heavymetalhorns: @smashlord4000 Probably depends on the state or city, but it's extremely low all over. @AlisaeRae Very good question lol
[5:47:25] PurpleKow: danCop get him boys
[5:47:25] drobro47: That's esnuff
[5:47:39] Brandance: I’ve had esnuff of that quest
[5:47:40] kempman11: we deserved some chocolate after that
[5:47:44] Cakedonut: DIESOFCRINGE
[5:47:45] starzha: @lebignose cohhSip
[5:47:45] Aurellea: @AlisaeRae Employers can claim a "tip credit", which is what allows them to pay below federal min. Not every state does this though, but a good chunk do.
[5:47:45] tedstickel: @DansGaming when are tou going to make a cape ?
[5:47:46] devauto: snuffed them out
[5:47:50] doctor_mav: @heavymetalhorns that's just dystopian
[5:47:50] JuicyDoubles: danBlank
[5:47:53] Insanefrenzy: Yeah they can pay tipped employees below minimum wage ONLY if their tips equate to them making at least minimum wage, if tips+hourly don't add up the business has to supplement them to match
[5:47:56] TheSolree: @doctor_mav sure, but that doesn't mean people working there don't want tips danKEK Besides, not everyone is a tourist apparent so how would they even judge
[5:48:00] AlisaeRae: @heavymetalhorns Looked it up and it seems you're mistaken which is good https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped/2007
[5:48:03] Cruduxy: less snuff more booty AMOGUS

[5:48:54] Aurellea: @AlisaeRae Yeah it's not great. Thankfully not an issue in my state, we get state min wage and then some on top of our tips lol so my partner makes almost $20/hr + tips LUL
[5:49:01] AlisaeRae: @heavymetalhorns I hate this lol
[5:49:10] doctor_mav: @TheSolree local cultural practices/standards don't always apply to foreigners
