[0:36:07] Sebleh: How come every group is running two healers? The prevoker dam is so low the h pal is just extra DPS?
[0:37:03] Raikaria: they're all running 1 healer 3 dps?
[0:37:05] Shearin77: meeres
[0:37:21] ggDoA: When you think about it, healing is just dpsing the emptiness in people's life bars.
[0:37:30] Bennodkk: why is Ecxho playing this like its mdi

[1:37:49] xGriefxGodx: love the teamcomp diversity. So glad I don't see any mistweavers in these things ever. Wouldn't want my class to be competitive.
[1:37:50] Torqez: @Radsol54 (Tyrannical, Incorporeal, Spiteful)
[1:37:58] laundrevity: what is the difference between NELT and NL (neltharian's lair) ???

[1:38:17] balbit: @Xyronic did you really just make this comparisson? LOL
[1:38:21] LotteC: @wazon_7 since you would expect a team to go with a suboptimal comp to "entertain" you, for a competition?
[1:38:21] Radsol54: ty
[1:38:27] djthednadan: why is Y team keep trying 31 nelth
[1:38:36] justmemoryb: TeamY do noting in whole hour

[1:39:03] jirayia399: as my grandpa always said consistency is key its still the great push not the great rush letzgo echo and Last minute :D
[1:39:09] xGriefxGodx: @LotteC The expectation is that the game is balanced enough for other specs to be competitive.
[1:39:24] lekargo: But every class will be better then others. And all are playable for "normal" Player.
[1:39:29] malddddktank: The question is, does tech mean technique or technology?
[1:39:40] ggDoA: Chess has had the same pieces for centuries and nobody complains! TGP has one comp for three weeks and chat loses their minds!
[1:39:59] Emiliability: @malddddktank technicality obv

[1:40:39] Beave_86: how much sanguine did Last Minute have in that last dungeon?
[1:40:43] xGriefxGodx: @LotteC If this comp is the best at the competitive limit, then it is also the best at all other levels. Delusional take.
[1:40:46] Ap_Jin: And chess is also a dead game
[1:40:57] Delliewelli: plink

[1:42:30] LotteC: @clapityclapt I have no problem pushing up to 23-24 lvl with other comps, eg a paladin tank, frost dk, DH and aug, and under 10% of players in retail plays above that
[1:42:44] Rogastik: The reason las minute was lower seeding because they didnt go hard with free hold cheesing with 2 tank, they had insane ulduman time
[1:42:57] x_Scy: @clapityclapt "under 10%", you mean well under 1%?
[1:43:15] SelistriaMonk: Who got eliminated?

[2:19:36] frayzan: @TCGRebel it was an opinion based on fact i dont know what more constructive you want
[2:19:46] tettles: @Ragnaqt there is a timer on details

[2:20:33] dzwen: @Ragnaqt i was just thinking about this exact same thing while looking at echo and zaelia who just constantly held a 160k+ hps and still had mana left

[4:44:30] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @spansonite1 that's because it's our plink queen, Meeix

[4:46:43] etthivernern: i dont get it who is winning lol
[4:46:45] ultideath: Why does Naowh need to especially start planning out the rest of their day?
[4:46:45] Warenz: is echo loosing
[4:46:55] Tussep: it annoys me that they keep discussing 1-2 days ahead because 1 key has gone bad for a team and all that matters in the first 2 days is basically avoiding not getting eliminated and ofc not be 3 dungeons behind every other team
[4:47:11] tharawow: monkaS

[4:49:52] Tussep: @PelPet My point exactly, but the casters are doing this on day 1 for every team every time they lose a bit of time. Also, 1 point at day 3 is on extremely high keys so it's very salvageable. It only takes 1 mistake from another team to drop those 30 minutes
[4:49:52] Meeix: @jedimind_lbc over the +2 timer buddy

[4:50:48] whiskytrix: if echo loses rwf AND tgp in the same patch...disband?
[4:50:54] Finaren_: @doxshund Ye They only won almost every major tournament ever
[4:50:54] Rivory: Didn't Echo had some problem with their practice time? Something related to electricity.
[4:50:56] Chr0nicConsumer: +30 with bear?
[4:50:57] juzuaz: ECHO WILL LOSE ,,,
[4:50:57] tondk123: sheesh wont clear 30
[4:51:00] Unknown_Devil99: Hi Guys, I am a newbie wow player. I only play AUG Evoker, Spriest, Fire mage and Guardian Druid. I dont know what meta is. Very sure it was unintentional.
[4:51:07] Mirculix: @whiskytrix never gonna happen
[4:51:16] kyagi1002: Why they Play Prot warri? Thought he is the worstest Tank at the Moment?
[4:51:17] Luk777ls: dont think that will work even last minute didt got the 30 nl
[4:51:25] Chr0nicConsumer: @kyagi1002 spell reflect

[4:52:42] thorkabuto5: No, Echo will qualify for the finals, and they are competitive animals in that kind of events, so Echo is still favorite for winning
[4:52:44] Shearin77: plz turn down the ingame sound

[4:52:49] Emiliability: @skihay yes but there's another day for that
[4:52:52] LGhost: LM lost a bit of time in the 30 NL, maybe a minute but it's really hard to play 30 NL perfectly which it needs to be

[4:53:28] Warchief_Teddy: I hope Last Minute come back for MDI. Be a hard Team for Echo to beat
[4:53:30] LGhost: @Word2BigBird 3rd i think, they did manage to get past 2nd boss tho
[4:53:33] surferkitty: could be the case that echo are sitting on some secret tech they dont want to expose yet aswell
[4:53:34] Orangebutnotred: last minute lost all the time lead they had Sadge
[4:53:37] DaBo00: @Word2BigBird no, they've tried once or twice before
[4:53:47] Rivory: @finaren55 That's a pity. I hope they recover on 2rd day.

[4:55:08] Radsol54: @JonasHno +1 28

[4:59:10] tettles: @HOBO_Twitch ?
[4:59:13] malven33: Get that healer out of last minute
[4:59:14] bloddbear: The Augmentation Evoker is the 3rd spec for Evoker - Its a "buffer" class, that buffs the teammates, which needs to have downsides and that is that they themselves aint doing any dmg - Which is why you might think they are "healers"
[4:59:16] mazllli: meeres just floating thru the dungeon

[5:01:42] Fatassfrodo: @Chr0nicConsumer ^ up to 25~ stuff is survivable with good play
[5:02:23] whills: Is echo going to make it?
[5:02:34] moltencrucible: @Chr0nicConsumer any spec can hit 3.2k as well, but people likes to play meta and the game is honestly not that alive... not so many people won't really tryhard with off meta specs to push rio

[5:02:52] NewTechGuy: Sloth OH NO

[5:03:16] woahdudewhat: @whills for today pretty sure yeah
[5:03:17] Nativo1: @moltencrucible the funny things is that most pugs groups dont worth using augum, tank doing low dps, heal without doing damage etc

[5:18:45] kharr32x: its such a surprise that the best comp is being used
[5:18:46] TrainedTiger: @clapityclapt They have to do the key on +30 to unlock other specs

[5:27:43] james26m: if echo does this 30 today they are really close to end top 2 in the weekend already right since   only other key that other ppl can do is maybe 30 NL en maybe 31 netlth

[5:28:57] Greitda: imagine testing a spec before it goes live, blizzard special
[5:28:58] Rogastik: @radixtree considering they both already wiped in there 5 + times
[5:29:01] Emiliability: @radixtree not much of a oneshot when they both have like 5 tries in the dungeon
[5:29:01] KembriaTV: Hey guys I'm new to mythic +, but I was under the impression this game has something like 39 specializations. Why am I only seeing 6 of those 39 across 4 different teams? Help me out here.
[5:29:01] nick_scz: echo further into RLP with less time passed wow
[5:29:05] Bennodkk: radixtree they have both failed it many times
[5:29:08] tynehlig: every team exact same comp, are there really no other classes that are competitive in the meta?
[5:29:13] zerossussy: @Mirculix oh ye, was just wondering because of the i is different in german i guess? which is interesting

[5:32:10] spansonite1: she sound pretty good.
[5:32:14] Arkn_: Why are they using evoker in this comps?
[5:32:15] papazell3: @GloriousBeard boring
[5:32:17] chubahi: cant we just ban the ppl that say anything about " meta comp " :D ?
[5:32:24] Fatassfrodo: Just have to hope sloth doesn't pull all charge treasures
[5:32:32] Bennodkk: yea no one is paying attention to sloth and Y the 30 ruby is more exciting
[5:32:33] WingsofCrap: just split screen the 30s
[5:32:36] Thomas_Huayra: sorry didn't mean to offend
[5:32:38] EzzLyfe: What happens if Sheesh times and Last Minute depletes?
[5:32:41] danielnylev1: !leaderboar

[5:33:10] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: c'mon Last Minute vibee
[5:33:15] Bloocked: @kimohunt Echo will time it, LM wont. Remember this.
[5:33:20] spansonite1: like as a commentator; but i still miss Ziq because he get really excited!
[5:33:22] KissyChelle: Echo attempted this 30 RLP like 3 times earlier.
[5:33:36] SebastianMelmoth1854: @BpizzaTV the only difference is dependent on people being in nelth's lair, where they take prot warr
[5:33:39] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @spansonite1 don't worry, Ziqo still casts AWC :)
[5:33:40] Arkn_: I didn't played this expansion and I don't understand the function of this invoker üòÜ
[5:33:46] kimohunt: @kimohunt we will see, i support both, but LM had been doing a much better job these 2 days so yeah
[5:33:48] LGhost: echo hasnt even got to where LM did (twice)
[5:33:55] Thomas_Huayra: @spansonite1 did he ever do pve?
[5:33:59] xGriefxGodx: Hey guys when should I expect to see a fistweaver or any monk class? Just wondering. I play monk and would really like to see my class compete at the highest levels.
[5:34:00] Dankmanarmy: PROT WARIOR GIGACHAD
[5:34:08] Maverick1126: @Arkn_ DIDN'T PLAY*
[5:34:09] nick_scz: @Arkn_ it basically increases the dps of the other 2 dps massively
[5:34:09] Thamarian: Very confident with the word Rotunda today.  Yesterday you weren't even sure it was a word
[5:34:14] Fatassfrodo: nice, sloth tank is running decurse for last boss they have this

[5:34:18] masterbit95: @Brucewayne517 lmao
[5:34:22] Bennodkk: awkward silence
[5:34:23] DaBo00: @LGhost echo spent a good amount of time in RLP 30 earlier today though
[5:34:23] Sarinilol: there is also a way that sheesh can end the day as first place when they finish their +30 NL key or?
[5:34:41] sulozor: how is hearthjack not playing with a single defensive embelishment STILL
[5:34:44] DaBo00: GG Sloth
[5:34:45] moderatygos: both of our caster teams are amazing
[5:34:52] spansonite1: @Thomas_Huayra i do mostly PvE but i remember when Venruki and Supatease and that other girl commentate
[5:34:55] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @sulozor he's too good, doesn't need it
[5:34:58] Shearin77: gj sloth
[5:35:06] PelPet: GG Sloth
[5:35:11] LGhost: @DaBo00 i logged on their last attempt earlier, did they get past 2nd boss in RLP 30?
[5:35:13] moderatygos: venruki, supatease, ziqo, and eiya are the casters for AWC
[5:35:20] Warfgot: If Y times their HOI they win with time tie breaker they have 10min advantage that Sloth can't make up
[5:35:27] KissyChelle: Echo finished second boss, but Gingi threw while heading to last boss.  Did LM make it further that trash before last boss?
[5:35:27] DaBo00: @LGhost can't remember sorry
[5:35:28] Sebleh: Tettles is a liar! naguuraSmadge
[5:35:30] xGriefxGodx: Hey guys I'm new to mythic +, but I was under the impression this game has something like 39 specializations. Why am I only seeing 6 of those 39 across 4 different teams? Help me out here.
[5:35:31] Rndm3011: If Wildi has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has only one fan then that is me. If Wildi has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Wildi, then I am against the world.
[5:35:34] Arkn_: @nick_scz thanks mate!!!
[5:35:36] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @moderatygos and our boy Azael!
[5:35:38] Thamarian: Lets go Sheesh
[5:35:41] Lowerdark: tokyo drift mounts
[5:35:44] Bennodkk: can we split screen 50/50 to watch ruby 30 pls
[5:35:50] moderatygos: how could i forget azael NotLikeThis
[5:35:55] Arkn_: @maverick1126 thanks for correct! Not a native speaker hahaha
[5:36:04] TrainedTiger: Last Minute is winning this TGP
[5:36:05] kimohunt: LUL
[5:36:05] PelPet: @Lowerdark This dungeon always does the weird mount thing
[5:36:08] EzzLyfe: if Sheesh beat LM today thats gonna be really impressive given how well LM were doing
[5:36:08] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @moderatygos don't worry, I won't tell him
[5:36:09] Sunaruqtx: @Rndm3011 haHAA
[5:36:14] Lord_MacGyver: @moderatygos because he casts league too
[5:36:15] gelloz_: why are they showing s1 dungeons? replay?
[5:36:17] moltencrucible: @moderatygos is AWC starting after tgp finals?
[5:36:17] ModeraYsera: @clapityclapt we had a monk yesterday...
[5:36:20] Tobo: If Wildi has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has only one fan then that is me. If Wildi has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Wildi, then I am against the world.

[5:36:24] DaBo00: gc7Smol smol cat believes in Sheeesh timing the 30 NL
[5:36:25] Radsol54: so sheesh timing +30 gives them #1 yeah?
[5:36:26] Alaquane: ehh, nothing LM and Echo do is important for today. most important run right now is Y
[5:36:26] GLOCKXWORK: Someone tell Echo to be careful of the curb LUL
[5:36:31] Turbo_ww: has sheesh not used BL yet?
[5:36:40] fremen14: 8 seconds faster on first boss split
[5:36:42] Thomas_Huayra: If Wildi has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has only one fan then that is me. If Wildi has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Wildi, then I am against the world.
[5:36:47] moltencrucible: @moderatygos thank you!
[5:36:59] LGhost: Sheesh did something waiting 5 mins before starting this key, they either planned CDs better or changed bears gear maybe?
[5:37:02] kazzlik_: vspeedSH vspeedEE vspeedEE vspeedEE vspeedEE vspeedSH  Û†ÄÄ
[5:37:07] Reydien: Y controls their destiny, their 28 RLP gives them a huge time advantage.  they have 40:54 time advantage not counting their HOI (which can at max be 35 minutes)
[5:37:07] xGriefxGodx: @ModeraYsera Why isn't there a Monk playing today? Did that team lose already? Was it because they played a monk?
[5:37:09] Bennodkk: Andy knows how to play prot warrior so idk why he doesnt play it in this key
[5:37:14] kimohunt: Echo and LM failed the +30, lets see if Sheesh can do that. This week TGP are FIRE.
[5:37:17] Thamarian: Andys got it
[5:37:24] DaBo00: @Radsol54 unless echo or LM times 30 RLP yea
[5:37:25] moistdanglez: tettles such a goober lmao
[5:37:28] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: @DaBo00 what does smol cat think about Last Minute timing?

[5:37:38] thanertv: GGS

[5:37:56] TrainedTiger: Andy I mean
[5:37:56] kimohunt: @thanertv OH no
[5:38:00] zerocoolx: I think even if Y times it they are out
[5:38:03] DaBo00: gc7Smol smol cat has faith in Last Minute timing 30 RLP, but is hesitant to believe in Echo's timing
[5:38:05] thanertv: ggs
[5:38:06] megadragon101: <3 <3 <3
[5:38:11] Thamarian: Thaner with enough time to jump in chat...

[5:41:09] divix1001: @stovepov Hi you‚Äôre doing great ‚ù§Ô∏è
[5:41:11] Alaquane: @JombusTV  Sheesh had healer fall through world and constant DC. They are already safe and can play tomorrow.
[5:41:13] LGhost: they already gambled big by doing the 30, they were almost certain to get the 29 which would tied them with echo. they can't let that bug ruin their tournament
[5:41:15] greifat: Broadcast when seeing bugs ResidentSleeper
[5:41:21] TCGRebel: @itsly0n they broadcasters dont control the cameras
[5:41:24] Akennathon: Y currently have a 10min+ advance over sloth

[5:41:56] Noobslicer: Alright chat, time for RIOT!
[5:42:00] sulozor: Echo 30s faster in the gauntlet
[5:42:01] moderatygos: sheeesh had a bug issue, admins are deciding how to handle
[5:42:02] Reydien: if Y times they have the time breaker, they have 40:54 not counting HOI (which can at most be 35 minutes)
[5:42:04] Calmdownpls: but isnt RLP 28 vs 29?
[5:42:05] Evan_Ralston: #RERUNFORSHEEH
[5:42:08] Thamarian: Last Minute and Sheesh to advance
[5:42:10] simkinswow: can we pray for a Y wipe chat?
[5:42:13] darlays: what happened to sheesh? just got back
[5:42:15] itsly0n: If Wildi has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Wildi has only one fan then that is me. If Wildi has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Wildi, then I am against the world.

[5:42:18] EzzLyfe: @Calmdownpls doesnt matter
[5:42:18] Reydien: if they time HOI at 35:00 they'll still be 5:54 ahead
[5:42:18] HenerzDT: but sloth's RLP is 29?
[5:42:20] Thomas_Huayra: Question is; would sheesh have gotten a retry after time if the key was bugged in the middle of the day session?
[5:42:20] Finaren_: Rerun for sheeeeesh‚Ä¶ They cannot lose bcs of blizz
[5:42:22] Zorgggg: #RERUNFORSHEEH
[5:42:24] thingmabobby: lol how can you compare times in a 29 vs a 28
[5:42:27] daasdingo: the time tiebreaker is actually really weird, since it depends so much on the dungeon. maybe it would be better to count time in % of total dungeon time?
[5:42:29] AlmightyWitchDoctor: @Broku42 yea they started so strong yesterday and just waste so much time on a 31 nelth
