[0:23:41] timmayb166: who you got winning this cup
[0:23:54] GooseComics: Thats this week....
[0:23:55] Shirey12: Off topic, I hope they do something cool with Affliction. Kalamazi made good points on it. UA being 1 target. Siphon Life required for Malefic Raptures (more dots more damage), Dread Touch/Doom Blossom being a choice between single target or AoE. I hope Soul Harvester(Hero Talent) helps it a bunch. It's my favorite spec and class of WoW. Would love to see it in MDI.
[0:23:55] Neotahl: We might only see 4 Thrones all weekend?
[0:24:00] GooseComics: Throne is fucking banned
[0:24:01] MBG_95: its only gonna be played in Match 12

[0:24:21] jbenson444: that's not an MDI dungeon that's a live key (literally)
[0:24:22] zolal3: what can go wrong in that dung
[0:24:24] Neotahl: Is that winners final or losers semi?
[0:24:24] marcofellipe69: smack a rat ez money
[0:24:36] glorybethewaffle: Reminder, need to watch Match 12

[0:26:58] Ionized4: WidestJigglin
[0:27:01] Liryns: mandatory and sloth is gonna be a good matchup
[0:27:03] blightedfog: blightedfog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 10 month streak! 
[0:27:09] fleks27: your 4 qualifiers?
[0:27:10] Zhorrua: @jbenson444 same
[0:27:13] DatHuntard: Who all is Bald Bandits?
[0:27:14] fat_european0: Just do a watch party while playing or?
[0:27:17] yctnm: xddDespair
[0:27:20] uniqueusername7: just live stream and commentate your runs
[0:27:21] alstadi: wonder how good Eclipse will be
[0:27:23] sarefx: @dorki you missed so much of JB losing his mind over 4 dps last week
[0:27:24] maenkins: perplexed/mandatory lined up to win?
[0:27:30] Sankasa1909: What order?
[0:27:33] treavorthenusance: who's now? and why come on now
[0:27:35] burne114: Just stream the finals, it's too late for them to yoink your strats by then
[0:27:36] Smeeshed: yeah but who you got in group F of capcom cup
[0:27:49] mexnaq: i bet sloth will beat bald bandits for the finals
[0:27:54] fat_european0: I think it's cool
[0:27:54] bubz1108: dumb
[0:27:56] HeffaBear: who cares
[0:27:58] sukoWoW: it is what it is
[0:27:58] mistrblocker: i dont mind
[0:28:00] timmayb166: it’s fun sometimes
[0:28:00] whiskeyhide: these cowards wont even use havoc for 4th dps
[0:28:00] its_blando: lame
[0:28:00] jannekvarnc: 4 healers 8)
[0:28:04] teegx: cool pocketpick, but its too easy right now
[0:28:04] scuffes: cool nische stupid if its meta
[0:28:05] kushlul: im bald i win
[0:28:06] Onko22: I am wondering if they will be implementing portal strat in Rise
[0:28:06] vellocets: it's cool sometimes. not all the time
[0:28:07] njokkio: it was too common
[0:28:07] try_weii: where is 5 dps tho
[0:28:07] blightedfog: the mdi key levels are too low
[0:28:08] jbenson444: it's simultaneously kinda cool and also kind acringe
[0:28:09] bubz1108: when people w 3 dps and a healer almost beat them i dont understand
[0:28:10] sv3nds3n: would be better with 5 dps
[0:28:12] Faraday5001: shows how dumb living/healing keys this seasons is
[0:28:13] its_blando: if a dungeon is doable with 4 dps isnt that a problem?
[0:28:21] ricktwooo: xdd
[0:28:22] Hillzor: It feels the same way as when aug replaced a dos last season.
[0:28:28] Emm_Zee: drohgoh ret Aware
[0:28:28] marcofellipe69: bald
[0:28:29] azi_cs: how’s MDI really compare to TGP?..  eclipse did well in TGP, does that bode well for them today?  higher key pushers..
[0:28:30] xetremwow: sounds like skill issue to me xdd
[0:28:33] glorybethewaffle: is that a drogoh problem or a 4 dps problem xdd
[0:28:35] GENERALFISTA: i prefer 5 tank comp over 4 dps
[0:28:35] alstadi: it's cool to watch but I think they should nerf the defensives and stuff like mass barrier, VE etc for next expansion
[0:28:36] ChesusOnWater: it sucks for healers to learn dps..
[0:28:37] t4pekid: MoadMoad peepoCheer
[0:28:39] fleks27: went 2 years back in discord dms to find bald kush pictures
[0:28:41] DatHuntard: Can take it or leave it. Would be cooler if it was a random niche reason rather than the dungeon being too ez.
[0:28:49] BallenitaSploosh: cant wait for war within to drop and delete the healer spec Gladge
[0:28:49] uniqueusername7: correction, some classes.
[0:28:51] sarefx: @fleks27 so fking worth it
[0:28:53] jbenson444: it's less about the dungeon than the offhealing, defensives, etc.
[0:28:56] try_weii: is 5 dps possible
[0:28:56] larouzbear: I found it astonishing that one group had more dps done with druid healer compared to echo (NOT sure) with 4dps
[0:28:58] bubz1108: miss ashen
[0:28:59] spotteddoggo: we need another hybrid tax!
[0:29:01] ottomr1990: 4 dps in MDI is fine. the whole point is to see cool shit.  if it was in TGP i'd have more of an issue with it
[0:29:03] frejaclueless: growl waiting room yumy
[0:29:05] harold_whittles: the same people were saying s1
[0:29:10] sukoWoW: i was surprised by how much offhealing ret was doing
[0:29:11] whiskeyhide: wildigW
[0:29:13] timmayb166: Aug or ret better for 4th dps?
[0:29:14] CrackedOrb: too many aoe stops in the game
[0:29:14] kelrien1: and they nerfed Feral group healing... sadge
[0:29:15] glorybethewaffle: @frejaclueless xddPeat
[0:29:20] marcofellipe69: asianj1Fatasianjeff
[0:29:22] jakkal93: ashen hollow... good times
[0:29:29] Smeeshed: hot take, DPS specs shouldn't be able to heal anyone but themselves full stop
[0:29:29] lol_iris: @dorki any tips/resources for getting into tanking? Guides, videos, anything works
[0:29:36] niviventer: xddPeat make healers great again
[0:29:38] scuffes: @dorki correct me if im wrong but isnt it barriers and random self healing which is through the roof, boomi actual healing is close to none imo
[0:29:42] uniqueusername7: aoe stop 7 times in a row and then the pack is either dead or you get 1 shot by a spell
[0:29:45] uniqueusername7: pretty pog
[0:29:46] khebul: I think healers enjoy healing rot more than burst damage, so changing the incoming damage profile might help
[0:29:57] Zhorrua: i just tried to click "I Agree"...
[0:30:20] treavorthenusance: dps wall is like non existant outside of like 31 fall maybe lol
[0:30:23] sarefx: @dorki is 4 dps that far ahead compared to standard comp? It didnt seem that much last week
[0:30:30] Toofurp: I love that this week is fort bolstering, I love 18s having one shots
[0:30:30] Ravenlynnwolf: I hate it (main a healer) I think its bad design and healers get  enough shit without these idiots that couldn't do a high key saying they don't need healers now
[0:30:32] javybavy: instead of the high dmg how do they balance the healing role with scaling then?
[0:30:35] marcofellipe69: asianj1Fullbox
[0:30:44] spotteddoggo: DAWGS
[0:30:47] Neotahl: But is that just cus resto is sick?

[5:16:15] zachl_: @handcannon77 at least u had the option to farm
[5:16:24] zachl_: now ur just farming tert for sub raid gear
[5:16:29] zachl_: what a fail by blizzard
[5:16:38] handcannon77: ye I know I want titanforge back
[5:16:58] xGuiha: raiders robbed us of tintanforing Sadge
[5:17:39] kwizzzz: i will never use my titanforged vault getikku again Sadge
[5:17:43] MiguelicusTheGreat: what key level is mdi set to?
[5:17:43] zachl_: ya those people are crybabies

[5:18:02] Kappadroid: I still don't understand why we can't chase tertiaries
[5:18:15] zachl_: @Kappadroid elaborate
[5:18:17] madtrade2600: titan forging made the game exciting. you ALWAYS had a tiny chance to loot something sick
[5:18:22] Ghostfumes111: Press lego
[5:18:23] yesman297: asmon rarely has good takes on retail wow anymore
[5:18:24] worldhealer: People who couldn't Titanforge did not like Titanforging.
[5:18:24] Theliahh: @Kappadroid why cant you
[5:18:38] handcannon77: I have over 20% avoidance on my arms warr(technically 30% since arms gets 10% free) and I havent gotten shit for my priest that needs it
[5:18:39] KDaily: unholy bad at this boss
[5:18:59] Kappadroid: @zachl_ Like all this avoidance and leech shit and we can't reliably get it, like vendors or whatever, we just pray it procs
[5:19:00] Vods: Unholy bad TOOBASED
[5:19:10] Ghostfumes111: PRESS LEGOOOO
[5:19:13] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: He just rallies his minions to kinda shitty takes tho
[5:19:15] Harleybane: @yesman297 entertainer says crazy things for content. it's amazing innit
[5:19:19] ajordon11: dorkiTake
[5:19:23] Theliahh: it would be absolutely bonkers if you could farm avoidance tho @Kappadroid
[5:19:24] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: Also said M+ was too hard, but likes Souls games
[5:19:25] zachl_: @Kappadroid thats not the issue- its that the piece that that item is competing with is 489
[5:19:28] zachl_: thats the main issue
[5:19:28] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: weird
[5:19:29] handcannon77: yeah I wish reclear and farming mythic was more chill earlier on
[5:19:31] xGuiha: asmon gets money from shit talking, so thats what he does
[5:19:34] heloraeon: raid needed to be difficult to occupy people during content drought
[5:19:37] AWalnutS: has it been toned down from shadowlands though?
[5:19:55] zachl_: cause if it was just farming tertiary- or farming titantforging- it wouldnt be an issue its the fact that that gear is already sub optimal
[5:19:56] LightdarkGaming: my guild disbanded last week, we were on TIndral:D
[5:20:11] its_justgifted: @LightdarkGaming sadge
[5:20:20] DanKnee16: Same here. Went on break for the season
[5:20:21] shunsha: must be nice to have a legendary. /cry
[5:20:38] Kappadroid: @zachl_ Non issue if there was a vendor or smth, just make it like reforging
[5:20:45] maxwell_313: mythic raiding is cringe
[5:20:46] imvots: how many weeks left till s4?
[5:21:01] tempo119: my computer melts on nymue and only nymue
[5:21:01] KDaily: tindrall too
[5:21:02] k4t4ly5t: does asmon even play wow, or is it still just all react content?
[5:21:06] KDaily: it’s a fireworks show
[5:21:11] heloraeon: @imvots 10.2.6 ment to be march then the s4 will go onto ptr apparently
[5:21:12] Shaians: honestly they do that on purpose
[5:21:14] Linith_Heart: if you have a 100 takes 1 or 2 of them are bound to be a good take i guess
[5:21:20] ezzerbell: i think its hilarious you say that while playing udk with defile lmao that shit covers the whole screen
[5:21:21] Shaians: blue on blue and ...
[5:21:29] onewidit: !build
[5:21:42] zachl_: @Kappadroid i dont think blizzard is smart enough to come up with a more realistic system since theyve pretty much triple down on less tert and no titanforging
[5:21:47] yesman297: yea well how can u expect him to have good takes on m+ if he doesnt even play the content
[5:21:49] Harleybane: Asmon listens to bellular, thats a redflag if anything
[5:22:21] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: Some of Bellular's content is good though. The lore videos are pretty entertaining
[5:22:25] Kappadroid: Asmon the kinda guy that would say he got glad but paid rank 1 players to carry him

[5:23:18] Linith_Heart: did last hope try unholy at all?
[5:23:21] sheckles: why are you hiding valuable pad damage xdd
[5:23:25] ajordon11: @poopstain221 you just saw it
[5:23:26] poopstain221: xdd
[5:23:28] sagiilul: Asmon is farming the salty boomers who got bored of retail and want to relive the glory day sof classic
[5:23:34] Lokitoki81: whats the whistle sounds for. Interrupt warning`?

[5:27:18] lol_kronuss: @lukeflooked bro only the 1% even gets to mythic tindral lmao
[5:27:20] KDaily: need more Smolderons, that fight is a banger
[5:27:27] Lambchop175: but once u see consistent p2 it falls over decently fast, p1 was tons and tons and tons of pulls for guilds
[5:27:30] handcannon77: I think we killed in like 400, but could have asily killed way before that tbh
[5:27:34] Geckoos: smolderon makes me wanna go touch grass
[5:27:40] warsheep015: @dorki do u think the bad luck protection for the lego is kinda to weak at this point into the patch?
[5:28:00] ezzerbell: i think im fucked in the head, i killed tind and fyrakk pre nerfs and i swear i found tind more fun than fyrakk. fyrakk just wasnt that fun of a fight imo

[5:29:56] KDaily: poor rogue looking at this UDK outside his cool downs for help
[5:30:00] zeph_6: tindral is killing guilds left and right
[5:30:10] Gaikang_: I'd love to see fyrak juiced up in a timewalking raid in 2034
[5:30:23] maxwell_313: they can have it like this for the first 4 weeks for rwf but why is it still this hard
[5:30:25] maxwell_313: makes no sense
[5:30:25] harci: @zeph_6 this. not sure how we will able to keep the group together... :/
[5:30:34] xpungax: I've just started playing WoW, what was the problem with Jailer?
[5:30:35] 101g: Where is the mdi
[5:30:59] zeph_6: tindral needed a macro somewhere to be the ultimate fucker boss
[5:31:23] sheckles: and that one blood dk bug PepeLaugh
[5:31:33] buffytide: There was also 3 very hard bosses before it, atleast before halondrus nerf

[5:33:07] Halt57: i never did that fight on mythic, but it was fun on heroic pre nerf when it still had all the knockbacks
[5:33:18] danaxvx: halondrous was the balls that went into the boss and the hand off thing that did damage to you

[5:58:14] unodapally: I'm surprised people still play retail
[5:58:23] nezo_pont: when do you go nelf and when dwarf in giga high keys?
[5:58:26] just_ok_viewer: because CDR and proc rate also scales on target number... the only reason they can do that is by having a cap
[5:58:30] imvots: what's the strat?
[5:59:19] kat0feya: btw did the community learn how Zaelia used the portal in the Rise last week?
[5:59:22] Peepars: meld too stronk
[5:59:25] just_ok_viewer: more or less quadratic scaling requires target caps... i think unholy dk has only ability like that and they have to neuter epidemic on low target counts to work
[5:59:30] Ditysalad: Last Hope worked on the Rise portal tech?
[5:59:32] UnlimitedBytes: MDI is so weird that you are not allowed to do stuff everyone does on live
[5:59:38] sheckles: or if you are a rogue
[5:59:38] Veritas1014: still dont get that because it was used all teh time in mist
[5:59:58] DalikSkywing: Oh yeah we watched this
[5:59:58] nezo_pont: hell yeah nelf supremacy Chadge
[6:00:01] dragonhawk303: dr. atnos breakdowns
[6:00:02] Veritas1014: so this legal but the DHT isnt?
[6:00:03] maacfroza_: will you play next week?
[6:00:06] kat0feya: thanks
[6:00:16] nanomach1n3: @unodapally im@more surprised people are stuck with a 2004 game and payed to play it
[6:00:24] ungnyaa: firstGarf
[6:00:31] Vods: firstGarf
[6:00:33] Veritas1014: the Plaugefall double tank misdirect strat?
[6:00:34] TheZoningBro: Is Mandatory DQ'd from the entire tournament, or did they just lose a map?
[6:00:34] rhino_u: firstGarf
[6:00:37] Peepars: @Veritas1014 the rise is different because those mobs were designed to do that
[6:00:37] Heimthal: are they DQ from the whole cup
[6:00:39] hdott52: firstGarf
[6:00:41] DalikSkywing: firstGarf
[6:00:45] straighttokes420: wait when is the cup?
[6:00:49] nezo_pont: what incident?
[6:00:55] lolkittinz: what comp/comps do you think will be strongest in s4? it is interesting to see MDI comps vary from the comps that are being ran in the top keys (warlock a big one)
[6:01:04] sagamariia: wait, why exactly where they dq?
[6:01:11] AWalnutS: was that dq justified?
[6:01:12] Heimthal: oh so fine then xD
[6:01:23] DalikSkywing: They pulled mobs with pets through wall
[6:01:41] sagamariia: ohh, you have to pull before the walls come up?
[6:01:42] zelenory: where can i find your weakauras mr strimmer your ui link done work
[6:01:58] toastbam: so they still won the match tho
[6:02:02] Ditysalad: they both pulled mobs one just used pet
[6:02:07] iseeyouokoeq: FUCK NA
[6:02:08] maacfroza_: @zelenory go to his discord
[6:02:08] DalikSkywing: ModChed
[6:02:11] minopmmm: Will the vod be uploaded to YouTube? I missed mdi
[6:02:22] Veritas1014: should already be there
[6:02:22] dorki: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPygJI-8mOo
[6:02:31] minopmmm: Ty!
[6:02:34] Peepars: How did he target them from that far away?
[6:02:37] Linith_Heart: is MCing the bug in everbloom not allowed or is it fixed at this point?
[6:02:40] Heimthal: bald gang looking good
[6:02:45] sheckles: @Linith_Heart its fixed
[6:02:54] maacfroza_: @Linith_Heart its fixed

[6:03:02] Linith_Heart: that didnt last long
[6:03:11] hectickudu: why can pets go through walls tho real question
[6:03:13] Heimthal: this MDI is going to be crazy close
[6:03:15] unodapally: Did they get disqualified?
[6:03:22] zelenory: @maacfroza_ thanks al look in there now
[6:03:36] aenoswe: is it allowed for monks to trans in after wall is up?
[6:03:37] Peepars: it's not allowed until Echo does it, then it's "clever use of game mechanics"
[6:03:45] onewidit: If they had tagged those mobs before pulling boss would that be legal?
[6:03:55] arcanosxdd: imagine if Echo did that.. would be insane lol
[6:03:58] Naasharu: They can just go around before boss spawns and pull those
[6:04:18] yoimdave: do you feel like they should be dqd from the tourney? or an honest mistake thinking itd be cool so just the one game is cool
[6:04:20] kat0feya: @Peepars true
[6:05:00] nanomach1n3: @unodapally why you care about a retail competition? were you not talking trash a minute ago?
[6:05:27] sagamariia: well, it's not like a huge error so
[6:05:29] onetime740: onetime740 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[6:05:33] sagamariia: losing a map seems fine
[6:05:36] AWalnutS: wasnt it used for mist?
[6:05:39] floodoec: didnt iron docks have a tech like that
[6:05:49] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: If blizz can't fix it, it should be allowed /shrug
[6:05:52] toastbam: wait im confused, they just lost a map right? not yeeted from mdi
[6:06:03] floodoec: control beast hunter pull
[6:06:08] floodoec: or something iirc
[6:06:13] sarefx: i mean they are not a newbie team they should have known they should ask
[6:06:13] poyc: ngl sloth looked like they had a chance after rezan
[6:06:27] dahyyun: you could pull the enforcer on the stairs after the 2nd last boss with a pet right
[6:06:53] ThereisnoCarrollinHR: Dorki got Mandatory punished confirmed
[6:07:00] maacfroza_: planed sabotage
[6:07:04] aenoswe: When was the ECHO thing in "plagboro" (spelling) ?
[6:07:05] turfjitsu: snitches get stitches lol
[6:07:08] Regroot_Gaming: Exploit start ish ?
[6:07:30] poyc: what did they do?
[6:07:41] 00hugh00: is the rule, basically once the boss is started. No more pulling external mobs.
[6:07:51] aenoswe: Thanks gonna check this out.  Dont you think that shadowmeld should be removed since you can skip mechanics, areas and what not?
[6:07:52] frostdecay_: but blizz should tell the teams that u cant when some1 ask
[6:07:53] TheZoningBro: Though to be fair, this dungeon wasn't really close. They beat Sloth by a wide margin... But Blizz does have to be standardized in their response to this stuff.
[6:07:53] Peepars: global threat
[6:07:58] dahyyun: YES react to max reacting
[6:07:58] bebincalicious: OMEGALUL
[6:08:07] Linith_Heart: content

[6:08:50] ungnyaa: xdx
[6:08:53] thendj: didnt they hide ui at the start of key
[6:08:54] thendj: yep
[6:09:02] Peepars: oh I miss the greatest tank spec  ever  the cardboard assasin
