[0:26:50] Hayotal: @Aceline_EU All of Roiben's controlc was 404 recently aswell. Someone in her discord said they had issues
[0:27:06] Sjeletyven1: control c recently made it so that all guest posts are deleted after 72 hours or soemthing
[0:27:13] Sjeletyven1: so you need to make an account and redo all posts
[0:27:19] Aceline_EU: @Hayotal must be because it was longer than 72 hours im sure
[0:27:42] Hayotal: @Aceline_EU Probably xD
[0:27:54] Dargnh: are you playing reforestation + convoke?
[0:28:01] jdotb: !command edit !threatplates https://controlc.com/db513051

[0:28:15] Aceline_EU: tyvmmm
[0:28:19] nggobi: We're getting into phase 2 a lot atm, we're playing with Veng dh right there so it shouldn't be too long before we get into phase 3. Saw something about only being able to drop 2 seeds at the very beginning when the boss dies incredibly much faster now atm.
[0:29:03] dithrica: we just did our first full night on tindral; 57 wipes in 3 hours. most pulls were about 30s lol. I want to throw myself off a cliff
[0:29:22] xAntdoggy: thatsssss normal... lol
[0:29:24] Sjeletyven1: lol jobs
[0:29:30] Nonyamuff: I'm trying the Hpriest builds from Method...seem interesting

[0:29:58] oathbreaker4314: you made me play wow again after 3 years, used to do high keys in legion, seeing your stream again after all these years, made me hypedüëçüèª
[0:30:01] Nextback_: i have job !

[0:30:53] xAntdoggy: \
[0:31:55] Sjeletyven1: long ass Kreygasm
[0:32:02] xAntdoggy: ass the long way
[0:32:05] Whitewolf1441: you recover mentally after the great depletion yesterday?
[0:37:09] Sjeletyven1: and its at the end of the dungeon
[0:37:39] Whitewolf1441: i feel like the issue here is no good way to practice
[0:38:06] inspirox: what dungeon was this? DOS?
[0:40:06] shortsniperxbt: what do you change when you need to take improved dispel in dungeons?
[0:40:34] Whitewolf1441: understandable
[0:42:25] debo_bde: they for sure fail keys and then leave and try again until their strat works
[0:43:09] RemwayTV: How close to 3800 are you? :O
[0:44:34] tr1plus: at high keys I feel dungeons become more like raid (predefined cooldowns) compared to just yolo bugging
[0:44:41] tr1plus: pugging*
[0:44:59] inspirox: look at andy's team they constantly spend hours in a dungeon pulling something til then consistently do it, doing that in atal rn
[0:45:03] tr1plus: but it might become required since things start 1shotting
[0:46:00] tr1plus: when thaner's group does a pull, I believe they always have the same CC/defeensive rotation ect.
[0:46:08] tr1plus: same with offensive rotation
[0:46:20] Akahashy: You used to play on NA while living in EU back then right? You ever struggle to find High keys? I feel that is very hard to find 27+ on NA during EU hours
[0:47:22] Akahashy: yeah you barely find 1-3 28+
[0:47:32] Akahashy: I'm stuck with a 28 throne
[0:47:37] Nonyamuff: Most pugs here make me want to off myself lol
[0:47:52] RemwayTV: yeah im OCE on NA and I spend like 45 mins trying to find one key at 27+ as rdruid that doesnt want a disc priest
[0:47:57] inspirox: 28 thrones not a stuck key that's a great key
[0:47:59] dithrica: yeah, I‚Äôm done with 26s and spent 12 hours yesterday to do three keys at 27+
[0:48:08] RemwayTV: thats weekend peak T_T
[0:48:24] Nonyamuff: Hoping to find a group for S4
[0:48:35] Akahashy: @inspirox It's one that's been the hardest at least for me

[0:57:24] toxictimbo: ultrawide is great but do not get oled
[0:57:45] Nonyamuff: Lol I play on a 18" laptop
[0:57:50] Whitewolf1441: ultra wide is luxurious
[0:58:17] toxictimbo: oled for a only wow player would get burn in so fucking fast
[0:58:24] tr1plus: I just have 2 1140P monitors
[0:58:33] Mafre1: Cool text @toxictimbo
[0:58:47] toxictimbo: POGGERS
[0:58:55] tr1plus: do OLEDs still have that bad burn in problems?
[0:59:03] DreadgrimDK: thats not true anymore ONLY THE first  bunch burned in
[0:59:04] toxictimbo: i bought a alienware aw3423dwf for about 13 months
[0:59:05] tr1plus: I know the TV sizes have those issues, but normal monitors
[0:59:13] Guarok: I went to an ultrawide a while back.  Great for gaming but for streaming it'll mess with your stream aspect ratio.
[0:59:25] Earthcrusher87: I play on a 15.6 inch laptop monitor lol..
[0:59:30] Whitewolf1441: wait can you explain what wow has to do with burn?
[0:59:48] toxictimbo: alienware only gives you a second hand one though
[0:59:52] toxictimbo: after 12 months
[0:59:56] magros84: I‚Äôve got a 27inch asus oled 240hz monitor and it‚Äôs amazing. no burn-in
[0:59:59] tr1plus: @Whitewolf1441 static elements (healthbar, Weauars) can cause the leds to become "lazy" and stay that color
[1:00:05] magros84: wouldn‚Äôt ever go back
[1:00:14] toxictimbo: you can also get an alienware one very cheap if you just talk to customer service
[1:00:16] tr1plus: but it shouldn't be the case with more recent ones anymore, especially normal sizes
[1:01:39] toxictimbo: alienware has a pixel refresh popup that comes up every 4 hours of use that takes 6-8 minutes
[1:01:42] toxictimbo: which is fucking annoying

[1:17:27] RemwayTV: I like that you termed it palettable
[1:17:38] Manu7: losing a key level for missing timer is by far the worst thing atm
[1:17:40] monochromator: Wonder if/when someone will time a +32
[1:17:50] FLUFFALOBUFFALO: yes sir
[1:18:28] sw0ngs: @FLUFFALOBUFFALO go blacksmith profession and use the master hammer haha
[1:18:30] inspirox: the timer just gets tight like that 32 fall was near perfect and still couldnt time with no aug
[1:18:30] omnixslash: maybe incentives completed dungeons? feels bad wiping early, disbanding and now i've not learned anything
[1:18:54] monochromator: Wipe on 3rd boss is a long run too
[1:19:20] inspirox: do you skip miniboss now since its attached? that glaive on 30 was slammin

[1:27:05] jimmy____________________: As tank
[1:27:34] globzim: if you have trinkets / absorb shields you can use that when he casts bloom on you

[1:27:55] RemwayTV: so rageheart etc
[1:28:03] jimmy____________________: Sick, ty
[1:28:29] Taijituwu: brewmaster meta
[1:28:33] globzim: if you have dps who are able to taunt and meld they can meld the bloom cast as well and negate it
[1:28:44] globzim: they need to taunt before the gloom is cast thou
[1:29:10] globzim: (even the healer can but its not really that easy for heals given the amount of dmg going on)
[1:29:57] flowerpwrxd: i updated my weakaura addon and now all my WAs are gone, any tips?

[1:36:51] WingedChipmunk: does weakaura companion automatically update or does it notify you that updates are needed?

[1:45:26] drumminbacon: aug is only a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù for the top .1% the average player only complains because they see some dude on youtube or twitch bitching about it.
[1:47:19] Possitiviti: When you pug 28+ do you usually know the players or are there generally same people or also new people you ahvent met?

[2:08:22] TakkaZJ2: also, im semi-new to resto druid, do you typically anchor one of your lifeblooms on yourself or do you just go head and throw it on whoever is taking damage?
[2:10:05] TakkaZJ2: dope. ty. there are obviously times where im not taking damage so I wasn't sure
[2:10:06] omnixslash: is there anything we can do to help bdks or just send positive vibes their way

[2:15:44] pichuux: also the food u guys have in America its kind of bad
[2:15:50] kelly_mac06: while i was waiting to have my knee replacement surgery, it was a HUGE struggle to not gain weight since i wasn't able to do like any real exercise
[2:15:53] kelly_mac06: it was terrible
[2:16:22] Whitewolf1441: weird question but what made you fat before? fast food/snacks?
[2:16:27] Aceline_EU: same
[2:16:42] kelly_mac06: yup, it's easier to avoid if it's not there at all
[2:16:51] seamonkie26: My 3 year old eats Salad and Broccoli for breakfast lunch and dinner she is weirdo
[2:17:06] Piaggio: what about you jb, you're a snack peepoShy

[2:22:26] kelly_mac06: i dont want to get sick
[2:23:21] theBroHam: i have a thyroid condition and it messes so badly with metabolism, it's been hard to get a good diet
[2:23:22] pichuux: @kelly_mac06 diabetes its not genetic, u just need a good diet and some √¨fast
[2:23:38] marnix9876: how u couldent wake up stairs
[2:23:53] gripps22: if it's not too personal, how much did you lose?
[2:23:56] pichuux: u guys need to fast as much as possible and eat as less frequesnt as possible
[2:23:57] lilyosa: gj
[2:24:04] JackOfAllApocalypses: I yoyo'd my whole life until my late 30s...lost 110 pounds then, and have kept it off for more than a decade now
[2:24:14] marnix9876: had the same problem getting fit is so much better
[2:24:18] kevinsk8er: look into seed oils and u will never be fat
[2:24:30] gripps22: very nice job man, for reference, how tall are you?
[2:24:47] seamonkie26: Yea i have Hypothyroidism so it was hard for me to think id ever lose weight too i just settled with the fact that I was gonna be fat forever and then i got pregnant and decided i needed to change for my kids so during my 1st pregnancy i lose 50lbs
[2:24:49] OrieleHS: so many diet scientists in chat
[2:24:53] Whitewolf1441: lmao
[2:24:54] pichuux: @kevinsk8er hope u dont use seed oil
[2:25:13] pichuux: just olive oil
[2:25:15] kevinsk8er: i dont i worded that weird
[2:25:27] seamonkie26: then i just kept it going
[2:25:34] theBroHam: @seamonkie26 that's awesome, I have that too. I'm glad to hear success stories. My levels are extremely unpredicatble
[2:26:28] seamonkie26: @theBroHam yea it was hard but it was worth it im gonna keep going and loosing more (even though i gained a few back )
[2:26:57] Aceline_EU: i lost 30 kgs then gained 30 after a year later now ill lose again xd
[2:27:24] frozenheartsqt: Comfort will keep you in the state you're in
[2:27:25] dithrica: yeah, I love food. I don‚Äôt even eat very unhealthy, I‚Äôm just 5‚Äô3, female, and in my 30s, so the amount I eat just for maintenance is not a lot lol
[2:27:42] TheBoulder_: ello
[2:27:55] caradea_: being jacked is one thing, but it helps you to stay mobile when you're old
[2:28:56] seamonkie26: Yea once your at a certain weight you just kinda stay there you have to work harder to keep loosing
[2:29:22] Snaaade: Is your pre made offline today ?
[2:29:41] seamonkie26: yea when i started breastfeeding i gained back 20lbs lmao ugh
[2:30:00] kevinsk8er: just dont eat 4Head
[2:30:35] TheBoulder_: were just talking about general weight loss right now?
[2:31:40] JackOfAllApocalypses: this is true...you definitely have to just keep paying attention
[2:31:51] theBroHam: training your body that a smaller amount of food is adequate is hard
[2:31:55] sw0ngs: yea you get muscle memory from being fat, so you can get fat rather easily
[2:32:48] Hoflax24: The old "If you give a mouse a cookie" moment
[2:33:36] dithrica: god the social stuff is so hard for me, it‚Äôs actually wild how much of my interaction with people involves food and drinks
[2:33:43] JmantheThief: would you say you have an eating disorder or no?
[2:33:50] dithrica: I lost 10lbs in January but I also didn‚Äôt leave the house lmao
[2:34:23] TheBoulder_: oof. i can relate to that. slacks that were once a comfortable fit becoming unwearable is terrifying
[2:35:20] lilyosa: nah makes sense
[2:35:22] kelly_mac06: lol all you can do is wait for the light bulb to burn out
[2:35:31] kelly_mac06: or at least hope it does
[2:35:37] Hoflax24: @dithrica The thing you realize is if you're with people who love/care about you, they don't give a fuck if you're actually eating/drinking with them and just that you're there
[2:35:42] kelly_mac06: i drink a ton of water, it helps when i feel "hungry"
[2:35:49] Latexion: yoo are u using convoke or tree of life? or does it depend on a dungeon?
[2:36:08] WingedChipmunk: @Latexion depends on dungeon, hes been experimenting with tree recently
[2:36:23] theBroHam: ozempic and shi
[2:36:24] dithrica: ozempic
[2:36:25] frozenheartsqt: Whenever my stomach starts to growl I just tell it to shut up because it already had 2 cigarettes
[2:36:36] JmantheThief: GLP-1s are magic that way
[2:36:47] kelly_mac06: i know some ppl that use wegovy but they are both diabetic
[2:36:57] kelly_mac06: they LOVE that it's helped them lose weight as a side effect
[2:37:05] JmantheThief: could always take some adderall, great appetitte suppresant
[2:37:19] flawlesslykun: i want to stop smoking but i know that if i really try to stop, i'm gonna fucking eat all the time
[2:37:21] flawlesslykun: i love to eat aswell
[2:37:34] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun see when i quit smoking years ago i lost weight
[2:37:39] kelly_mac06: i was too stressed out to eat lol
[2:37:53] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:38:06] dithrica: the way I‚Äôve heard it described is it takes all the joy away from eating. trying to remember specifics but I think it affects the reward feedback as well, I know I‚Äôve seen some studies about them with other addictions as well
[2:38:29] brandon_bop: I got way into rock climbing a few years back - I quit smoking to get better at it because I was having so much fun with it.  It's the really engaging activities that help I feel.
[2:38:35] frozenheartsqt: @flawlesslykun I feel that. It's almost like moving the stress somewhere else. instead of having the cig release stress, food is what replaces it.. when I tried quitting I was stress eating like mad
[2:38:53] rapiwow: Hey jdotb
[2:38:59] rapiwow: Q simulator also sadge
[2:39:08] bearbro9: were you on keto?
[2:39:09] flawlesslykun: that's the thing @kelly_mac06 i've smoked since i was under 18 y/o. it doesn't even calm anymore, it actualy feeds my anxiety nowadays i think... but it's like a "need" if i don't smoke, otherwise i want to keep eating
[2:39:15] sw0ngs: sounds like some keto shit
[2:39:17] bearbro9: keto?
[2:39:38] theBroHam: young and naive
[2:39:55] GoodyGodfather: Good Morning JB
[2:40:08] caradea_: that sounds unhealthy
[2:40:17] theBroHam: sounds like a wrestler trying to cut weight diet
[2:40:23] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun yea i smoked from age 16 to age 32
[2:40:40] kelly_mac06: quitting wasn't fun but i did it and it's been 12 years since i quit now
[2:40:51] Etherios_Prime: irl lock rocks
[2:40:53] fremen14: how was the pain 1-10?
[2:40:53] brandon_bop: Too much buildup in the kidneys yeah rip
[2:41:11] flawlesslykun: ye i'm 33 now. i'm at that age that i rather just save the money
[2:41:15] TheBoulder_: WutFace
[2:41:28] JdTre: thats horrendous
[2:41:31] dithrica: that would indeed take the joy out of eating lmao
[2:41:31] Scarooo34: that sounds amazing!!
[2:41:31] brandon_bop: I did that for my cat when he was having stomach issues.
[2:41:33] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun dude it is SO much money holy shit. you dont even realize it until after
[2:41:33] flawlesslykun: especialy since i can't find good weed to smoke anymore, so i'm a retard that is smoking cigarettes
[2:41:43] brianfromadidas: morning jb
[2:42:01] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun oh yea id lose my mind without good weed. that i wont give up lmao
[2:42:15] brianfromadidas: so the changes to dragonriding on Tindral are giga cringe XD
[2:42:45] kelly_mac06: @brianfromadidas man it was bugged before lol now it's back to how it was
[2:42:47] GoodyGodfather: Yah its a huge problem in the mid west
[2:43:01] theBroHam: I mean shave your head and we've got Walter White lol
[2:43:04] Ghost5392: Just be in Canada. You can buy it easy. EZ
[2:43:06] brianfromadidas: @kelly_mac06 yeh but honestly feels like a bug that didnt need to be fixed lol
[2:43:32] gripps22: super conspicuous
[2:43:35] kelly_mac06: @brianfromadidas that's fair but i honestly expected it to be fixed way before now
[2:43:46] GoodyGodfather: HES ON A LIST FOR SURE
[2:43:53] kelly_mac06: LMAO poor JB
[2:43:54] dithrica: 100% lol
[2:43:58] brandon_bop: It's for a diet, I swear
[2:44:00] brianfromadidas: @kelly_mac06 it's just slightly annoying being this far in and now it's fixed lol
[2:44:02] kelly_mac06: lives in tennessee, buys the drugs to make meth
[2:44:04] flawlesslykun: @kelly_mac06 the 1st mistake was starting to smoke in the 1st place, but i never really wanted to quit because i genuinely love weed. i don't drink at all because i like smoking it so much. Problem is in Portugal it is still illegal, and will continue to be because this is a shithole of a country, that actualy allows companies to grow weed here, but not sell it
[2:44:05] kelly_mac06: def on a few lists
[2:44:19] GoodyGodfather: Oh yeah just as bad
[2:44:31] flawlesslykun: so i want to quit smoking completly now that's the point. cba wasting money on tobacco
[2:44:47] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun that's fair, it sucks to live in places where weed isn't legal. i prefer edibles to smoking but i can't imagine not having some weed around. id be very sad

[2:50:42] Ok_Kingston: u wont
[2:50:47] brianfromadidas: we got some decent p3 pulls on Tindral this week, probs dead in a week or two
[2:51:21] Hoflax24: We're also on the Tindral slog
[2:51:52] brianfromadidas: we just have a great pull, hit the last nasty overlap and fall over lol
[2:52:08] brianfromadidas: then we int in p1/p2 for the next 5-10 pulls lol
[2:52:53] brianfromadidas: we just need to sort out the 5:50 overlap and i think we'll be in good shape
[2:52:55] Hoflax24: Our guild is big on "first pull of the day get to 2%, int the whole day, kill on the last pull"
[2:53:00] Hoflax24: And has been for a long time LUL
[2:53:06] SixOneZil: tindral p3 is "easy", it's just p1 + p2 so there is less need to practice stuff
[2:53:07] brianfromadidas: are we in the same guild? l;ololol
[2:53:27] Ok_Kingston: @Hoflax24 same. Smolderon we got 10% first pull, and never got back
[2:54:26] brianfromadidas: i think we'll probably get 1 more pity nerf to last 3 by like end of month
[2:54:34] brianfromadidas: give more guilds time to CE before S4

[4:58:08] devilhawk83: Awakening was actually fun with all the skips and the corruption system though getting the corruption gear you wants was not fun till I think they added the vendor in 8.3.5 where you can buy the corruption you can apply to your gear
[4:58:18] bazefacee: does the healer take reducde damage if it's on the tank?
[4:58:38] devilhawk83: you want to chain the tempest blast to hit the tank on the second chain
[4:59:12] devilhawk83: or whatever it is called
[4:59:40] bazefacee: yeah but if I spell reflect it as a warrior doesnt it negate the whole thing
[4:59:49] theBroHam: clean so far, no jinxes
[5:00:09] devilhawk83: so people would form a box like pattern and the tank in in the middle so that when the boss targets a player, the chain always hit the tank
[5:01:35] devilhawk83: since the chain attack will target the next closest player which you it to be the tank
