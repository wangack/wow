[4:03:05] Buttsoap: kermit: In the relentless grind of two jobs, one at Pizza Hut, the other at McDonald's, he sought refuge in the clouds of giant dabs. Exhausted but driven, his heart found peace at home with his beautiful down syndrome girlfriend. Their love was a haven, transcending barriers, where every moment was a celebration of pure, unconditional affection. In her embrace, the weariness melted, replaced by the warmth of a connection that went beyond the challenges of daily life.
