[0:30:06] MachoCham: The animation of this mount on the ground is awful

[0:30:24] MachoCham: HOLD THE FUCK UP

[0:45:52] Roflrobbie: hey yall. Happy Friday
[0:46:02] Haestoh: so I‚Äôve developed an obsession with Cubone and Marrowak. I think they‚Äôre so cool

[0:47:39] AkuTVgg: amazing
[0:47:51] Airt1: then the kid turns out to hate pokemon
[0:47:53] RAF_Sean: Yup

[0:48:14] Haestoh: I mean, you get the boulder badge ‚Äúbeating Brock‚Äù üëÄüëÄüëÄ

[0:48:54] Davinah_00: morning @Pandachoww  <3
[0:48:55] Larkaro: the kid can only get the boulder badge if he beats his data in pokemon
[0:48:58] lunamists: umbreon is bis
[0:49:03] Larkaro: *dad
[0:49:12] Pandachoww: Daaaaav
[0:49:14] ImperfectDark: I only started playing pokemon in my 30s so it's never too late
[0:49:15] RollieRodz: umbreon is bis true
[0:49:24] Pandachoww: why the f are you up this early?!
[0:49:31] lunamists: we haven't so we binged them today :D
[0:49:39] Haestoh: so I found this random seller on Etsy that sells Pok√©mon handmade resin displays. they‚Äôre so fucking cool and I‚Äôm so tempted to drop ¬£90 on a Cubone one
[0:49:40] Pandachoww: OOF Big @RollieRodz in the house!!!!

[0:50:05] chelfx: Any new wow news today?
[0:50:06] RollieRodz: @Pandachoww ayo
[0:50:13] ImperfectDark: the wand company do some REALLY nice pokeball replicas
[0:50:18] Haestoh: just discord DM‚Äôd you them. how sick are they
[0:50:30] RollieRodz: enjoying my morning thank you :)
[0:50:33] Pandachoww: @RollieRodz Sup king, how you doing?
[0:50:52] RollieRodz: yoooooo
[0:50:53] ImperfectDark: damn, that's amazing
[0:50:53] physalis4: yo dude! @RollieRodz
[0:50:59] Haestoh: I want one
[0:51:00] ImperfectDark: i love the aura effect
[0:51:00] BBMezzy: That's awesome
[0:51:02] Pandachoww: ive got ads but that looks dope!!!
[0:51:03] RAF_Sean: Those are gorgeous
[0:51:03] Haestoh: so bad
[0:51:14] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:51:34] Thoreya: its always been not profitable
[0:51:50] lunamists: they're letting go of 500 employees apparently which is like 35%
[0:51:51] RollieRodz: that what it sounds like from the CEO
[0:51:51] Thoreya: which is why ads are such a thing
[0:51:52] Pandachoww: i mean its a nice little side earner for me rn, im not complaining
[0:51:54] Big_Rum: Hillarious you said that the second an ad break started
[0:52:10] Mazerbeam: That was never a secret. The fact that the c suite is leaving and they laid off 35% of their staff is news
[0:52:29] Thoreya: corporate
[0:52:34] RAF_Sean: Executives
[0:52:35] School_Toilets: Amazon will force you to put an ad banner on your forehead soon
[0:52:39] Pandachoww: yeahh i get its different when you do it full time
[0:52:40] Akela3: c suite = executives
[0:53:10] physalis4: I see those on Twitch randomly
[0:53:18] Nulgar: don't they already in some cases? I think the streamer has to opt in, though
[0:53:34] MediumRareOG: twitch's unprofitability is a lie to cut creator earnings
[0:53:35] Promilie: I cant believe ads even work. Nothing makes me consider buying a product LESS than when it interrupts what Im trying to read or watch
[0:54:12] RAF_Sean: I used to watch full ads and then click on them for YouTube channels I really liked
[0:54:18] RAF_Sean: NEver bought anything but I Was doing my part
[0:54:18] Haestoh: prime gaming rewards have gotten worse over the years. you‚Äôd see more people use prime just by incentivising partner developers to make them better
[0:54:35] Thoreya: @Promilie do u feel the same with commercials?
[0:54:35] physalis4: I thought it was interesting how he said big contracts for streamers have no ROI
[0:54:50] Vaephera: Twitch has previously quoted the basic AWS bandwidth rate to say how high their costs are, but that's something you can negotiate down by as much as 80% or more if you pre-purchase in bulk. It's hard to trust their numbers.
[0:54:57] RollieRodz: he did say it
[0:55:12] SlithTheSivak: what you need is an annual big money convention, DanCon, where you charge tickets and we all get to hang out in London or something
[0:55:22] Thoreya: no
[0:55:24] Thoreya: sub company
[0:55:43] Thoreya: theres a calculator to calculate how much it costs twitch to run ur stream..found it from another developer streamer the other day
[0:55:46] physalis4: physalis4 gifted a Tier 1 sub to RollieRodz! They have given 10 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:55:49] Thoreya: super interesting, and expensive
[0:56:05] Nulgar: Preach did a con, didn't he? not sure about his numbers, but can't be that much bigger
[0:56:11] RollieRodz: yooooo @physalis4 thank you dude >3
[0:56:16] RollieRodz: <3
[0:56:18] physalis4: <3
[0:56:26] RollieRodz: my boi
[0:56:28] Nulgar: maybe less a con than a quasi-official meetup, maybe attached to another event
[0:56:54] SlithTheSivak: live podcast would be fun
[0:57:13] Uchiha_Cloaky: What mount can srop from this dungeon?
[0:57:25] SlithTheSivak: do you know if your american or eu audience is bigger?
[0:57:38] Haestoh: I‚Äôd come to the Guildford Spectrum for DanCon
[0:58:16] Aceadam: do you think the season of discovery serervs being merged with EU and USA via layering is good?
[0:58:27] Pandachoww: @imjoeski ew to the south
[0:58:33] SlithTheSivak: you could DJ the afterparty! dream come true
[0:58:38] Haestoh: I said to you and I said it to Kex the other day. We need a WoW UK Creator group like OTK
[0:58:57] SlithTheSivak: i agree with imjoeski
[0:59:09] Nulgar: @Aceadam would rather say it's necessary, long-term
[0:59:15] Pandachoww: just move, its better up here ;)
[0:59:15] SlithTheSivak: you, Preach, T&E few others
[0:59:35] Aceadam: @Nulgar ya can play with my friends from the US which i like
[0:59:35] Haestoh: get together once every 2-3, months. bulk record a bunch of irl content and trickle it out
[0:59:40] Pandachoww: probably heard that from another southerner...
[0:59:49] physalis4: Living near family when you have kids helps soooo much
[0:59:56] funviking99: I plan to move there since the south is so expensive
[0:59:57] SlithTheSivak: you should hire imjoeski
[1:00:03] Uchiha_Cloaky: Imagine all these mogs ur getting u can learn them in the new expac ... means u can learn all mog categories can be learns by 1 character no matter what class .. hyped for it
[1:00:03] Steebadin: How far is "the north" ?
[1:00:10] physalis4: there's a reason why ppl say "it takes a villiage"
[1:00:16] Aceadam: you mean north in the UK?
[1:00:26] Pandachoww: @Steebadin pretty much anything north of oxfordshire
[1:00:27] SlithTheSivak: i suggested the EU OTK idea a while back too, you guys dont need to sell computers just join together
[1:00:31] Aceadam: im near manchester
[1:00:50] Steebadin: Isn't your country tiny?  Everywhere is only a couple hour drive
[1:01:15] Airt1: it's relative
[1:01:19] StreamElements: EVERYTHING Coming in Patch 10.2.5 "Seeds of Renewal" | Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/RVe32RozJGM
[1:01:23] SlithTheSivak: Dan, would you do a couch podcast on T&E's channel?
[1:01:24] Steebadin: Sorry I'm from Australia and it looks tiny
[1:01:25] Mckenziehehe: I mean, 6h isn't really that far
[1:01:29] Aceadam: our roads are very bendy comapered toi the US
[1:01:36] Nulgar: @Aceadam tbh I'd love something like that for Retail, like a temporary character transfer, you move the character from the Launcher, not being in the game. Needs some form of limitation, either a cooldown to transfer, but you can always "fling back", or a cooldown back and forth
[1:01:56] physalis4: a 6hr drive in the US is still a slog
[1:02:07] Pandachoww: the m1 is a snoozefest and the m6 is just traffic
[1:02:12] SlithTheSivak: I mean my parents are 6h from me and we live in the same state
[1:02:34] Mazerbeam: 2 hour drive in the UK is day trip. 2 hour drive in the US is a commute.
[1:02:35] Aceadam: ya m6 always accidents
[1:02:42] Larkaro: The whole country is run by Emu's since we lost the war
[1:03:05] Haestoh: If trains didn‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg. travelling in the UK would be so easy
[1:03:07] Nulgar: oh mimimi clodagHeheheh
[1:03:13] RAF_Sean: Unhinged
[1:03:16] physalis4: I think some ppl react that way just to engagement farm
[1:03:25] Nulgar: it's only for the casualest content, so that solo players can experience story
[1:03:28] Big_Rum: Its because so few people roll healer IMO.. que times are rediculous
[1:03:32] zNzUV: i understand why people are mad they are wasting resources and people on smarter npc's that will serve 1% of the player base imo
[1:03:36] Pandachoww: remember when trains were decently priced?
[1:03:54] Pandachoww: when i first got with my ex i used to go down to ashford for like ¬£60
[1:04:00] RAF_Sean: I have no problem finding groups and I am super hyped for follower dungeons
[1:04:01] Airt1: I never read forum comments until this season 4 vote stuff
[1:04:04] Aceadam: your CD is skipping
[1:04:07] Mazerbeam: People are hostile because they are dumb
[1:04:10] zNzUV: i think after islands and all that shit imo people see it has wasted resources
[1:04:10] Airt1: i never want to read them again
[1:04:12] RAF_Sean: Even just to hang out wit hthe Exile's Reach characters and farm some mog
[1:04:19] Pandachoww: yeah but compared to like 200 now...it was cheap
[1:04:22] Aceadam: get that toothpaste to clean them scrat5ches lol
[1:04:28] Akela3: i'm not sure it's been wasted resources because the AI NPC tech they're using has been developed over years and rolled out in other places they're just implementing it in dungeons
[1:04:41] physalis4: Soloing Islands with bots is the shit
[1:04:45] SlithTheSivak: with the crank
[1:04:54] Aceadam: haha yes
[1:05:12] Steebadin: Anyone old enough to have had a CD stacker in their car?
[1:05:15] Aceadam: then everntully GAME started to clean them at the store for l;ike ¬£1 each

[1:05:25] slambitz: the angry people always forgets the majority of wow players arent heavy groupers like the M+ and raid crowd
[1:05:34] Haestoh: I had so many ‚ÄúChipped‚Äù PS1 games.
[1:05:36] Aceadam: @Steebadin i had one on my wall
[1:05:50] Mazerbeam: As someone who LFRs frequently I am looking forward to playing with NPCs wherever I can!
[1:06:11] Steebadin: @Mazerbeam lol
[1:06:13] Annathebanana1986: Good afternoon
[1:06:15] Pandachoww: ohh man i have a great story about chipped games
[1:06:39] Aceadam: i had the PS1 disc mod
[1:06:46] RollieRodz: I think follower NPCs will be good, theres a huge section of the community that has anxiety about dungeons or just want to learn in a low stress environment
[1:06:49] viscka_games: viscka_games subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! happy Friday!
[1:06:59] Pandachoww: my dad was a copper for like 30  yrs right....and one of his mates, who was also a copper was selling chipped games to the boys at the station, bearing in mind piracy is illegal
[1:07:04] zNzUV: heres in Portugal we paid a guys 5 euros/dolars for a chip and the games were 5dolars each it was so dope
[1:07:07] Akela3: it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of people who are mad about follower dungeons are also people who also say it's rude to suck at wow.
[1:07:22] Lausten: @slambitz I've given up arguing with them since a friend of a friends reaction was something along the lines of "who cares about pet battles?" Me: A lot of people like it. Him: "Those people are dumb they should scrap that shit."
[1:07:23] Nulgar: back in my teens, a friend was bending a music CD for fun - after a while, he overdid it, the CD splintered into dozens of tiny pieces frogmu1Hehe

[1:07:52] Pandachoww: ill never forget getting metal gear solid when i was like 8...waiting weeks for it and my dad coming home from a night shift and FINALLY giving it to me
[1:07:54] zNzUV: that video is realy dope the "why is it rude to suck at wow" lel
[1:08:01] Nulgar: @Lausten who cares about PvP? Only a fraction of people play it. Just get rid of it
[1:08:08] Airt1: we used to throw CDs you'd find in the language textbooks at each other in school
[1:08:08] Haestoh: So I used to play a PS1 game called ‚ÄúFuture Cop: LAPD‚Äù that I randomly got chipped from my uncles neighbour. never met anyone that‚Äôs ever played or heard of it before.
[1:08:26] Aceadam: epic game
[1:08:26] Pandachoww: @imjoeski SUCH a goated gameeeee!!!!!
[1:08:43] Airt1: like lethal frisbees
[1:08:48] Haestoh: @pandachoww broooo, I use to love that game soo much
[1:08:59] Lausten: It is a Nerubian kingdom
[1:09:13] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:09:16] OrthiadNick: Ahn probably means old, Aj might be new? Kahet is then kingdom
[1:09:19] Pandachoww: i used to play the hell out of the 1v1 mode too, so good
[1:09:52] Iwony: it is nerub was mostly undead though due to the lich King there were not many normal Nerubs left, the ones who gave us those quests
[1:10:06] SlithTheSivak: do the walk around streams, let people fall in love with Guillford, then they'd wanna do it there :D
[1:10:11] RollieRodz: The North remembers
[1:10:16] Annathebanana1986: What event?
[1:10:48] Lausten: Poggers
[1:11:02] Nulgar: @OrthiadNick Ahn might also be smth like "First", since you wouldn't call something "Old" when founding it :D
[1:11:12] lyreilla: That is cuz you're awesome \o/
[1:11:17] Haestoh: news worthy creator. BigW
[1:11:24] Pandachoww: @imjoeski i used to be all about the army men games too
[1:11:32] Annathebanana1986: Only good thing about Manchester is the pixel bar
[1:11:33] Big_Rum: She got hammered at the last one it was great content
[1:11:42] zNzUV: if u murder kelani u basicly have number 1 undisputted wow content creator
[1:12:03] zNzUV: oh ok :/
[1:12:11] Lausten: Pretty sure thats a crime @zNzUV
[1:12:15] Nulgar: @OrthiadNick or it's just regional/clan differences
[1:12:21] Haestoh: honestly I wish more Uk creators did irl content. I love putting on vlogs watching people just go about there daily lives in the background while I work.
[1:12:25] Pandachoww: fun fact...i can do kelani's intro...with his voice perfectly XD
[1:12:43] lyreilla: I do enjoy his videos, his voice is so calming and keeps my focus
[1:12:49] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:12:54] Big_Rum: so as to my question yesterday Blizz responded and basically said if you dont have it by the 23rd resubmit a ticket
[1:13:02] Nulgar: @OrthiadNick but it'd be funny if Azj'Kahet meant something comparable to "New York" tneEvi
[1:13:14] zNzUV: and like you the videos have a porpuse and are quite informative you are both my favorites
[1:13:24] Haestoh: so many WoW creators have silky voices, MadSeason, Nobbel, Kelani
[1:13:37] Big_Rum: I still think its weird that i dont havethem yet
[1:13:50] zNzUV: madseasons voice is on another lvl
[1:14:01] realnzall: Evening Dan
[1:14:17] Lausten: Happy Timezone
[1:14:27] Airt1: what's super weird is that i've still never gotten the Legion fox mount, it's never showed up on my mission board
[1:14:28] Nulgar: no spoilers!
[1:14:33] Big_Rum: Watched the first three its gets better
[1:14:34] Darabelia: good day mrgm
[1:14:34] physalis4: what is Echo?
[1:14:43] Vaephera: First episode was weird because most of it was a recap of hawkeye
[1:14:50] Pandachoww: looks mid
[1:14:52] Nulgar: you've pre-blown my mind, you can't un-blow it!
[1:15:13] Promilie: the legion fox is one of my favorite mounts, I wish it existed as a hunter pet
[1:15:21] Nulgar: (TBBT quote/paraphrase)
[1:15:23] Big_Rum: Dude the fight scene with you know who where she hold her leg and kicks him inthe face was awesome
[1:15:48] Elrathir: you can't get that specific fox model tho
[1:15:52] realnzall: I've pretty much stopped watching MCU stuff after Endgame. I wish they had stopped it there, because everything just feels less interesting after a decade of Thanos edging followed by a movie filled with callbacks
[1:15:53] Pandachoww: theres a really cool fox pet in elwynn forest, the grey one
[1:15:54] Promilie: fox pets only come in the cataclysm model or the shadowlands model
[1:16:06] MediumRareOG: volpin is a cool mount
[1:16:19] Annathebanana1986: The lightning fox in duskwood is nice hunters pet
[1:16:29] RollieRodz: it was
[1:16:29] ImperfectDark: spirit fox is super cute as a pet
[1:16:33] ImperfectDark: jinx
[1:16:34] Big_Rum: Season one of Loki was amazing
[1:16:40] esrayk: esrayk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[1:16:48] Haestoh: I haven‚Äôt watched any MCU content since the second avengers movie. feel like I‚Äôm too far behind to catch up
[1:16:50] physalis4: I got confused with Loki towards the end. I couldnt keep up
[1:17:27] viscka_games: woot I got thanked twice üôÇ
[1:17:46] thunduz: had myself a donut for breakfast so great things going on round these parts
[1:17:47] Annathebanana1986: I've actually been binge watching MAFS UK and there's a Twitch streamer from Guildford on it LUL
[1:17:49] SlithTheSivak: looking at Guildford, you guys have a cool Guild Hall and a castle, I feel like its ripe for a WoW event
[1:18:11] Annathebanana1986: Married at first sight
[1:18:41] Annathebanana1986: George I don't know his last name
[1:18:48] realnzall: Yeah, I've seen some stuff. Shang-chi was cool, Loki as well, but a bunch of the rest was pretty miss mostly. But it's like Kopi Luwak: unless you're a coffee connoisseur, you're not really going to sift through piles of shit in order to get the rare beans out
[1:18:52] Annathebanana1986: Frenchberty is his twitch I think
[1:19:02] Haestoh: You got a license for the channel 4 player mate? mrgmZ
[1:19:19] Annathebanana1986: Yea that's him
[1:19:30] SlithTheSivak: the Cosy Club in Guildford looks straight out of Harry Potter
[1:20:17] SlithTheSivak: that would be a huge draw for me, I already convinced my wife we'd be attending your event so lets get scheduling
[1:21:38] RAF_Sean: >.>
[1:21:42] RAF_Sean: I use them all the time ><
[1:21:45] Annathebanana1986: He plays wow I think
[1:21:51] Pandachoww: Saaaaame....i never use them
[1:21:52] Zuldak: Hashtag used to be called pound sign
[1:22:00] RAF_Sean: Dan hates my tweets confirmed
[1:22:11] RAF_Sean: Uh oh
[1:22:12] Annathebanana1986: LUL
[1:22:33] Pandachoww: @Zuldak ¬£¬£¬£¬£ is the pound sign not ###
[1:22:40] RAF_Sean: I'm in this post and I don't like it
[1:22:48] RAF_Sean: lol
[1:23:07] physalis4: It's worth posting the link even if Twitter's algorithm buries links
[1:23:19] RAF_Sean: I'm not too proud to take good tips

[1:25:29] Haestoh: 100% agree, I try to use minimal #‚Äôs but I feel like not using any at all as a smaller creator feels like shouting into the abyss without them.

[1:28:35] ImperfectDark: that show on BBC. The Traitors
[1:29:00] realnzall: Something fun to do: look at a Twitter trending topic and count how long it takes for a porn tweet to appear
[1:29:19] physalis4: porn bots are out of control
[1:29:51] ImperfectDark: those bots are crazy, i'm getting like 10 spam follows a day. I've had to make my account private
[1:29:52] RAF_Sean: OnlyDans when?
[1:30:17] realnzall: I used to have a specific account for finding that sort of content, but I haven't used it in ages since I've found that Reddit is way better for that usecase
[1:31:12] Haestoh: how much would I have to crowd fund. for you to remake the trampamania with now at 30 with your brother and edit it the exact same.
[1:31:23] Haestoh: video now*
[1:31:34] thunduz: that would be legit actually lol

[1:33:39] thunduz: call it DanCon and see how many people named Dan show up. "oh hi I'm Dan. excuse me? Oh no I don't know what warcraft is sorry."
[1:34:19] Big_Rum: ytou are going to Preachcon yeah?
[1:34:22] realnzall: Call is DanKon for the memes
[1:34:30] SlithTheSivak: hypothetically, what would you call a group of UK/EU streamers if you formed a group like OTK?
[1:34:33] Annathebanana1986: Where in Swindon please?
[1:34:37] thunduz: Let's goooooooo! it's happening fam
[1:34:39] Zuldak: There actually is a Ryan-con.

[1:36:44] Annathebanana1986: ¬£20 entry fee LUL
[1:36:49] Nulgar: just did an incredibly stupid thing: -1¬∞C outside (just below freezing, for the yanks) and I went out to throw some salt onto the garden path and sidewalk (the tenants' responsibility here) in flat shoes without profile... already noticed my heel turning on the garden path, then I almost slipped and fell on the sidewalk, could luckily steady myself on a parked car.
[1:37:59] thunduz: oh hey did you check out echo?
[1:38:26] Squiggle10: That's what us Brits do best. Moan when it's too cold, moan when it's too hot LUL
[1:38:27] Haestoh: honestly just crowd fund for a big Airbnb in the Surrey countryside and set up a livestream to run 24/7 and just have a big piss up.
[1:38:31] thunduz: yeah 1st episode isn't the best with it being a recap
[1:38:41] lyreilla: I'm in the upper midwest (US), and we're getting a blizzard today. Hooray...not
[1:39:01] Nulgar: @Squiggle10 if only there was a land of eternal autumn
[1:39:16] Crimzon7: Its snowing all day today. Supposed to get close to a foot of snow
[1:39:22] thunduz: also a little hurt you had a marvel conversation without me. I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed
[1:39:29] MediumRareOG: The UK is a silly place
[1:39:30] Lausten: @lyreilla I hear that there is a Blizzard in Irvine CA Kappa
[1:39:53] Elrathir: well that sounds mildly horrifying
[1:40:02] lyreilla: @Lausten Yikes! Cali does not do well with snow
[1:40:09] Crimzon7: yeah Sunday to Wednesday High temp wont be above 0 F
[1:40:11] Zuldak: weather people made up terms to sound exciting and get people to watch them talk about the weather
[1:40:37] thunduz: I'll forgive it this one time I guess
[1:40:54] MediumRareOG: Americans like to make up names for "storms" so you end up with terms like "bomb cyclones"
[1:41:03] thunduz: thunduz is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to MrGM's community! 
[1:41:04] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to Arlaeya! 
[1:41:10] handovdoom666: i still wish I became a weatherman. i would love to have a job that I can be like 80% of the time wrong and still have a job.
[1:41:47] MediumRareOG: @handovdoom666 Be a politician. You can be 100% wrong
[1:42:09] Nulgar: ah, seeing you equip BoEs, I hope they implement a different  way to unlock appearances with class-agnostic unlocks in 11.0, like some button to turn BoEs into BoPs. Although overall, I'd like even more if there were no random BoEs anymore, instead the gear drops as BoP, and you also loot items that can be disenchanted (or just right-clicked for mats)
[1:42:22] handovdoom666: yeah but a weatherman still has a soul
[1:42:26] thunduz: American here, we don't make up storm names! Side note you've never been in a snow blackhole abomination storm? They're wild...
[1:42:49] realnzall: The big problem is that people are distrustful of reports on climate change because the weather reports are generally so inaccurate. Also, every time there's a day it snows they dismiss global warming even though we've been calling it climate change for decades now

[1:44:00] MediumRareOG: They don't tell you because as soon as you mention "wedding" they triple the price
[1:44:05] Lausten: @realnzall Some of the scientists that called it Global Warming have said they regret ever calling it that due to how dumb people use it as an argument when its snowing

[2:05:48] Lausten: Gather 25 to champion a faction
[2:06:25] MediumRareOG: Argent Tournament compets with the Maw as the worst grind in the game IMHO
[2:06:45] Elrathir: gotta do your dailies to earn the right to do your dailies!
[2:07:18] Hyzen88: yeah 3 per HC run, which is once a day iirc
[2:07:25] MediumRareOG: Heroic ToC dungeon gives 3 seals. Once per day. Normal ToC gives only 1
[2:07:32] wishkah82: 3 from the hc (daily) and 1 more the end boss in normal (spamable)
[2:08:08] funviking99: a few months of dailies
[2:08:18] Hyzen88: no, you neeed the lance to jump on the horse
[2:08:18] funviking99: gotta equip lance first
[2:08:22] flavio_ago: last time i checked no
[2:08:23] Promilie: no you need to manually equip the lance
[2:08:24] MediumRareOG: you need 850-900 just for the mounts IIRC. more for the tmogs
[2:09:00] chefdejour82: duel him
[2:09:04] funviking99: I just did for 3 weeks got the title and argen warhorse , gryphon and never go back LUL
[2:09:09] Hyzen88: before Cata this was the only way of getting your races tabard
[2:09:11] chefdejour82: nm
[2:09:22] MediumRareOG: At least they changed it. Get the alliance mounts and you get the Horde versions. That didn't used to be the case
[2:09:51] Promilie: There's a paladin-only mount too
[2:09:58] Chirpychap: I did mine on horde so long ago I didn't get the alliance mounts
[2:10:38] MediumRareOG: You end up doing about 10 dailies a day for 2 months
[2:10:49] flavio_ago: gives rep
[2:11:01] Nulgar: careful, don't criticize pre-Cata content too much or you attract the Classic defenders :p
[2:11:07] Zuldak: This is tol barad levels of awful
[2:11:08] Larkaro: this would have been the only thing to do in wrath
[2:11:11] Promilie: It'll be way faster next week when you can dragonride at least
[2:11:39] chefdejour82: no thanks
[2:11:47] Nulgar: what else is there to do in Wrath Classic?
[2:11:54] Hyzen88: I did it on multiple chars way back in OG WotLK
[2:12:07] Zuldak: those are the sorta who grind the insane title in both retail and classic\
[2:12:08] Lausten: Exactly, we did it cause there was nothing else to do
[2:12:42] Nulgar: @Hyzen88 yep, at least 5 chars, probably more - it was a nice way to gain city reputations for the mounts
[2:12:49] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:12:55] Lausten: We farmed valor cap weekly and then we raided, and did daily quests
[2:13:00] Roflrobbie: Dan you finish/start Echo?
[2:14:01] MediumRareOG: which is really 14 mounts
[2:14:02] Roflrobbie: gun hammer!
[2:14:03] chefdejour82: hammer gun
[2:14:11] funviking99: that gun hammer is pedestrian
[2:14:17] funviking99: perfect
[2:14:19] jayjayw54: what would you say is some of the easier content to farm to get achiev points/org % up?
[2:14:22] funviking99: lol my autocorrect
[2:14:25] funviking99: LUL LUL
[2:14:28] jayjayw54: points/prog*
[2:14:29] Hyzen88: the lighter gun matches normal dwarf armour as well
[2:14:53] jayjayw54: thank you!
[2:14:54] flavio_ago: 150 champion seals
[2:14:56] funviking99: argent warhorse
[2:15:05] Lausten: The kid that comes on a horde and can do mailbox, bank or vendor for you
[2:15:19] traktordestrucktor: have you played all classes  to max lvl? and all legion campains?
[2:15:20] MediumRareOG: there are Argent Tournament battle pets. don't farm tokens. You can buy them on the AH
[2:15:25] Nulgar: let's you use the Gruntling/Squire as a mailbox or bank etc.
[2:15:49] Elrathir: relevant to nothing, but damn, the 25% exp bonus in dreamsurge areas is pretty good. I just finished all the quests in Azure Span on my alt and I'm nearly level 69 having only quested here in the Dragon Isles
[2:16:01] Nulgar: I think Medium means don't buy the pets with tokens, buy them from the AH
[2:16:02] MediumRareOG: the tokens, the seals, whatever they're called. that you buy all the mounts and tmogs with
[2:16:05] Zuldak: dm fair ends soon if anyone needs anythig there
[2:16:43] Elrathir: that was all sidequests included, and the 50% extra rep buff was up twice while I've leveled here
[2:17:11] Elrathir: Also I'm taking a liking to Zygor for leveling
[2:17:23] MediumRareOG: I got into a routine. do all the dailies before the daily reset, do them again. every 2 days
[2:17:26] Elrathir: oh I didn't even know DMF was up
[2:17:29] Big_Rum: Plans this weekend?
[2:17:36] funviking99: imagine how many dailies to get all those things LUL

[2:23:41] Lausten: Dont have to use the horse
[2:23:49] MuuskeWoW: you can kill them without
[2:24:05] MediumRareOG: you don't need to get on a horse for this
[2:24:14] Nulgar: oh, that's new(ish)
[2:25:13] Nulgar: no, that you could kill them on foot - or maybe they just perma-stunned you at lower levels
[2:25:17] hersheyjh: It's in wrath classic but you can cheese it like that lol

[2:25:23] Haestoh: WoW Meet-up at Drayton Manor
[2:25:25] Nulgar: yeah
[2:25:30] Zuldak: yeah there are like 5 factions
[2:25:38] Zuldak: you champion one faction at a time
[2:25:47] Nulgar: and once you complete the city factions, you get more dailies for Champion's Seals
[2:25:47] MediumRareOG: after the first 15 you open up new dailies too
[2:26:03] Nulgar: or is that after the first city already?
[2:26:47] Hyzen88: Nah you can cheese it
[2:26:52] Iwony: only at the start
[2:26:53] death_cam_: you can kill them without
[2:26:55] Hyzen88: but you have to get on a mount to start it
[2:26:58] Langsig: You have to be on mount to start the encounter. AFter that you can go off
[2:26:59] Promilie: you go on the mount, start the encounter, then you can hop off and kill them all
[2:27:01] MediumRareOG: the first boss requires you to be on the mount for part of it
[2:27:02] Nulgar: probably, but you would definitely get stunned at lower levels - by now they probably miss too often
[2:27:03] Zuldak: you need to get on to start the dungeon but then you can hop off
[2:27:05] Iwony: unequip lance then kill and you can cheese
[2:27:31] Hyzen88: TotC M+ inc
[2:27:34] Zuldak: the halls of reflection  dungeon is the worst in all of wotlk
[2:27:43] Promilie: and in the Malygos fight too
[2:27:52] Nulgar: I'm one of those that actually like Oculus - it was piss easy
[2:28:33] MuuskeWoW: always the bag
[2:28:42] Lausten: Bag
[2:28:44] flavio_ago: writ gives rep if not mistaken
[2:28:54] Hyzen88: nono writ is just rep
[2:28:55] MuuskeWoW: bag gives one seal and some gold
[2:29:04] Lausten: The purse used to give gold but they give seals now
[2:29:26] flavio_ago: you need to be in the horse
[2:29:30] Nulgar: but you can probably participate while mounted
[2:29:32] MediumRareOG: everyone makes that mistake once. or 3 times
[2:29:38] Lausten: Yeah help each other
[2:29:47] Hyzen88: there is an achivment to beat another player in a mounted duel btw
[2:30:18] MediumRareOG: yeah, the cheat code here is another player can just kill the opponent while you're on the horse
[2:30:48] MediumRareOG: this is giving me PTSD

[2:31:49] MediumRareOG: yeah, the npc has a "less RP" option
[2:31:50] Nulgar: @Hyzen88 was it visible? it's not available on your first run
[2:32:02] Hyzen88: @Hyzen88 I didnt see, was to busy typing tbh
[2:32:08] hersheyjh: shouldnt take that long
[2:32:16] Nulgar: frogmu1Hehe
[2:32:45] Nulgar: yeah you need to do it once to be able to skip
[2:32:47] Hyzen88: oh my bad, it might not be available on your first run
[2:32:51] Hyzen88: sorry man
[2:32:55] MediumRareOG: maybe you have to do the RP once?
[2:32:57] Zuldak: if youve never done this dungeon befoee you have to suffer the RP once
[2:33:31] Zuldak: the 2nd boss is horrible becauyse there are 2 of them and which one you get is random
[2:33:34] jayjayw54: so what made ya do your completion on the hunter? always been the main?
[2:34:37] Hyzen88: lies, you're a Legion baby, don't deny it :-)
[2:34:46] Zuldak: its kinda like farming violet hold... bosses have unique mogs and they arent always in the dungeon
[2:35:07] hersheyjh: fav expansion?
[2:35:12] Hyzen88: ye
[2:35:18] jayjayw54: ah yeah thats my problem too  ive always played the same toon every xpac so nothing has a whole lot of completion/rep its all mixed and everywhere
[2:35:24] Langsig: they insta turn up and all 3 engage at the same time
[2:35:34] jayjayw54: mean tot say diffrent toons haha
[2:36:22] hersheyjh: no only first part
[2:36:25] Nulgar: No, this is on foot now
[2:36:49] Hyzen88: no
[2:36:56] Hyzen88: but it doesnt take long
[2:36:56] Langsig: Only skip the first thing
[2:37:00] Nulgar: I think there's an option to make this shorter, too
[2:37:06] Lausten: Dont be silly now, its Blizzard in 2007-8 LUL
[2:37:10] MediumRareOG: It's "less RP" not '"no RP" :)
[2:37:12] Nulgar: Or not, disregard me

[2:41:08] NeeK_23: mrgmHelloThere 60min weekend countdown
[2:41:09] hersheyjh: dungeons had different loot as well
[2:41:12] hersheyjh: in wrath
[2:41:24] Nulgar: And for dungeons that would be Normal and Heroic, but would have to check when these started to use the "same" items
[2:41:36] Langsig: one of the better ones. And HC gives seals for each boss and normal gives a seal for black knight
[2:41:46] Zuldak: disagree, this is awful because its random what 2nd boss spawns so its rng on rng if you get the last item you need off them
[2:42:35] Zuldak: legion heroic violet hold... the pinnacle of awful dungeon farming

[2:45:42] MediumRareOG: ICC is one lockout for 10/25. ToC probably the same?
[2:45:52] Nulgar: it takes forever clodagHeheheh
[2:46:10] hersheyjh: @MediumRareOG its not though
[2:46:13] Elrathir: Yes
[2:46:20] Elrathir: today is the day
[2:46:23] funviking99: took me@over 300 runs to get it
[2:46:32] emarol_dk: I have over 1000 try on invincible
[2:46:34] handovdoom666: i got invincible last time ulduar was TW in the chest
[2:46:34] NeeK_23: I have it so could trade if lightning stuck twice and I got it
[2:46:44] funviking99: dang
[2:46:59] MediumRareOG: You can kill the healing boss with bandages btw
[2:47:02] Hyzen88: just get it 4Head
[2:47:07] chefdejour82: heal her with a bandage
[2:47:11] emarol_dk: And still don't have it
[2:47:14] NeeK_23: I got it on my 3rd attempt after a guild got a 2nd drop and traded it to me
[2:47:26] emarol_dk: But I have timereaver üòí
[2:47:40] Langsig: Use a spirit mend from a spirit beast pet
[2:48:32] MediumRareOG: spirit beast is pretty easy to get now. there's probably healing trinkets too
[2:48:59] siggyfisk: üëãüèΩ
[2:50:11] Hyzen88: can you imagine if they had the storytelling delivery back then as they do now
[2:50:28] thunduz: that's how marvel should have handled kang. he should have had appearances in literally every movie in the last 2 phases
[2:51:29] BisonD: Jim Morrison is rolling in his grave listening to this remix
[2:52:41] Langsig: Just wait
[2:52:44] Nulgar: huh, even BC dungeons had the same items in both Normal and Heroic, thought there were different items on Heroic... but something was definitely changed, presumably when Timewalking was introduced, they have the same itemID, which definitely wasn't a thing back then (they even did 'manual' Thunderforged/Warforged variants on separate itemIDs in MoP)
[2:53:41] Zuldak: i think in legion the normal and mythic share appetences but heroic is unique
[2:53:48] MediumRareOG: Raid Achievement tRacker (addon) might help with this one. i forget
[2:53:52] Langsig: Wait till he submerges again i think
[2:54:45] TomCat: what's up Mr. M... first name G
[2:55:04] NeeK_23: IAT is bis
[2:55:18] Nulgar: ah wait, Normal and Heroic DID have different loot tables, but apparently they have been merged!
[2:55:24] TomCat: really? thanks - I didn't know that was a thing
[2:55:45] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[2:56:04] Nulgar: same for WotLK, including Trial of the Champion, knew it :)
[2:56:39] Lausten: I think they did it when they added Ulduar timewalking
[2:56:45] Nulgar: presumably for Timewalking purposes, but it affects even non-TW dungeons (maybe if they ever change them up)
[2:57:16] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:57:17] MediumRareOG: ICC is another raid that rewards a speed set
[2:57:45] MediumRareOG: there's so much running in ICC
[2:57:48] Zuldak: @MediumRareOG I read that as 'rewards a spreadsheet' as in you need a spreadsheet to track everything in there
[2:57:59] Nulgar: and yep, Cata then had items with the same name but different itemIDs, but these have been merged by now, too
[2:58:27] Nulgar: could really benefit from a skip
[2:58:30] Zuldak: i farmed it when i you could lockout share on an alt
[2:58:42] Nulgar: back then, I used an alt with a saved 25 Normal ID to cheese to LK 25 Heroic
[2:58:43] Zuldak: make sure its 25 heroic!
[2:58:44] TomCat: are you using the skip for your alts to go straight to LK?
[2:58:49] Nulgar: but that doesn't work anymore
[2:58:54] MediumRareOG: like i think my speed set cut down karazhan getting to the chess event from 20 minutes down to 10 minutes
[2:59:05] NeeK_23: surprised, given they did one for Siege of Ogr, that ICC hasnt had a skip added
[2:59:07] Nulgar: @TomCat is it still possible?
[2:59:42] TomCat: @Nulgar I don't know - it was possible for a long while after people were claiming it wasn't - I think they just didn't know how?
[3:00:02] MediumRareOG: i feel so vindicated by not farming the SoO mount and then they added the skip to garrosh
[3:00:50] OrthiadNick: Don't jinx it :P
[3:01:24] MediumRareOG: Between ICC and Argent Tournament, Dan is maxin g my PTSD today ngl
[3:02:05] MediumRareOG: SoS one iis fixed now. No DC. ICC 100% needs a skip. I say that as someone with Invincible
[3:02:52] Nulgar: And make existing skips account-wide

[3:05:34] Crimzon7: I call dibs on the mount
[3:05:53] hersheyjh: its cause ppl get sweaty and push the content then complain
[3:06:39] Nulgar: That post-Deathbringer RP cazikyUcry that was when good writing in WoW started, previous stuff mostly relied on the RTS games
[3:06:45] Haestoh: I feel like I‚Äôm the only one excited about cata Classic. have so many fond memeories of cata
[3:06:53] MarshDanni: Hey @MrGM how's it going?
[3:07:30] CipherNine89: oh i meant to ask, do mages get a portal to BelAmeth ?
[3:07:31] death_cam_: feel like not many players ask for cata classic but when the question of mop classic comes around i bet more ppl will want mop
[3:07:32] MarshDanni: @MrGM Did you manage to kill all the extremely rares in Northrend?
[3:07:39] Layliah79: i liked the questing hub via the portal in Mount Hyjal. Can't remember what it was called
[3:07:50] hersheyjh: @death_cam_ yeah ppl want MOP llol
[3:08:08] Layliah79: I remember the quest in Cata fondly where you climb the ladders in the trees to rescue the baby bears lol
[3:08:36] MediumRareOG: relive the dragon soul nostalgia
[3:08:42] Elrathir: maybe the plan is to turbo-speedrun cata classic to bring on MoP classic, idk
[3:08:44] CipherNine89: I have like 7 WoW friends that I've been playing with for years ... none of them want to play Cata classic xD
[3:09:23] OrthiadNick: I remember in cata it was the first time I took a break from WoW. Most people I played with quit around that time. LFR helped me around that time :)
[3:09:39] Elrathir: @MediumRareOG that feels like a brand new sentence
[3:09:47] Drorith_: honestly feel like they should of stopped at Wrath personally, at this point i can see them going to WoD unironically
[3:10:16] Nulgar: Cata was said because my WotLK raid guild fell apart during the first tier. Tried again and realmchanged during Firelands, but even that guild fell apart. If it hadn't been for LFR in Dragon Soul, I might've stopped playing then.
[3:10:23] Nulgar: *sad
[3:10:36] MediumRareOG: Start again. Classic 2.0
[3:11:06] hersheyjh: ive been playing classic since 2019 launch. Recently quit wrath and started retail. Not sure ill go to cata but surprisingly loving retail!
[3:11:13] Haestoh: there‚Äôs YouTube videos of my guild doing Bastion of Twilight progression. and I forgot how bad the video quality was in 2010
[3:11:32] Zuldak: i think its really clever to have so many instances of wow running parallels and they can always keep the players busy with a new update on one of them
[3:11:33] chefdejour82: been in the same guild with the same 11 people since 2008
[3:11:37] OrthiadNick: Honestly, think the experience of cataclysm is probably totally different for someone who started back then in WoW then for someone who played since vanilla I assume.
[3:11:42] Layliah79: Did the Yogg skip on 5 toons yesterday for the TWing weekly. Got all pets no mounts Dx
[3:12:02] NeeK_23: its interesting to see how the classic community went from #nochanges to SoD hype.
[3:12:27] OrthiadNick: The expansion was a big turning point for WoW

[3:19:59] fooxytv: have they removed him now from wrath classic or is he still there?
[3:20:06] nyrhalahotep: Play Ulduar one
[3:20:07] TruVillainManny: Happy Anniversary Mr. and Ms. GM

[3:30:58] OrthiadNick: Hey, atleast your completed some bosses in regards to loot drops
[3:31:05] thunduz: what do you mean? You got it you just can't see it since it's invisible
[3:31:10] chefdejour82: never ending
[3:31:12] Zuldak: did you see the post about how they destroyed the invincible model compared to what it was in WotLK?
[3:31:45] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[3:31:51] databob1: that was epically sad
[3:31:54] Hyzen88: @Zuldak Thats hyperbolic af mate. It was a slight change in the model used in the UI. When you mount it it klooks exactly the same as LK
[3:32:34] Zuldak: @Hyzen88 the wings were shrunk a LOT. it isnt the same
[3:33:03] Hyzen88: @Zuldak it is when you actualy mount it ingame. The model shown the collection is wrong
[3:33:08] Nulgar: @Hyzen88 figures people would get upset about nothing and not check whether it's actually true
[3:33:16] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:33:48] MediumRareOG: The tmog TWW change is going to be so good for vault of archavon and the legion/WoD raids with class-specific tier sets
[3:33:54] Hyzen88: rhinohead! pog
[3:34:10] Zuldak: @Hyzen88 That's... confusing. So the wow engine has the ability to shrink parts of the model like that? Cause I thought it was all fairly static
[3:34:55] funviking99: mrgmJAM mrgmJAM mrgmJAM
[3:35:01] Nulgar: @Zuldak probably a resolution thing, lower quality when rendered at a smaller size
[3:35:06] Hyzen88: @Zuldak Look at the replies to the tweet you're talking about. They are vidual comparisons between ingame retal and ingame LK. It's the same
[3:35:08] funviking99: !emote
[3:35:34] Nulgar: @Zuldak but these days, people often play at a higher UI scale
[3:37:56] NeeK_23: Ruby Sanctum?

[3:42:15] Nulgar: alright, who is looking for their kid? Anyone, please pick up your child
[3:42:32] CipherNine89: what is this dude on about

[3:42:58] Lausten: Its the german guy from the other day

[3:43:08] pooma27: lost in translation x1800pUmpa
[3:43:11] NeeK_23: @Lausten yeah
[3:43:12] MachoCham: Oh so addons as in expansion
[3:43:33] MachoCham: RIGHT we're with you
[3:43:46] Iwony: I am non native speaker I don't under stand them either
[3:43:52] SlithTheSivak: ESL?
[3:43:58] fooxytv: I'm confused
[3:44:00] pvalue01: well then LUL
[3:44:03] CipherNine89: evo needs some hot chocolate

[3:44:07] MediumRareOG: i feel like i'm missing a cereal box decoder ring
[3:44:07] MachoCham: Basically "Wow was shit in wrath because it catered to casuals*
[3:44:09] Hyzen88: I know some of the words
[3:44:09] funviking99: what ?
[3:44:12] Langsig: Because of dungeon finder?
[3:44:14] SlithTheSivak: listen english is hard
[3:44:15] funviking99: what is this about?
[3:44:20] Iwony: as germans say: H√ÑH????
[3:44:22] Nulgar: is this about Dungeon Finder? tneEvi
[3:44:28] SlithTheSivak: hes german! it came out
[3:44:37] funviking99: mrgmG
[3:44:45] Lheela: @Iwony for you that's "wie bitte"
[3:45:01] Nulgar: When it came out, WoW was THE casual MMO, compared to others at the time, which relied on grinding and costing you experience and levels when you died clodagHeheheh
[3:45:03] funviking99: retail is casual bro
[3:45:03] CipherNine89: Anywho ...hows the weather MrGM Kappa
[3:45:05] Langsig: Ich bin ein berliner!
[3:45:06] SlithTheSivak: ich bien ein viel
[3:45:07] chefdejour82: why does it matter
[3:45:08] RAF_Sean: Interesting lunch talk
[3:45:09] pvalue01: retail is whatever you want it to be...casual, competitive, etc.
[3:45:11] Hyzen88: we need the OneGuy emote
[3:45:14] pooma27: casual = classic?

[3:45:44] thunduz: kind of sounds like they're saying retail is harder now then back in classic when they made things easier?
[3:45:51] torpz: what is this guy on
[3:45:53] MachoCham: Heroic 25 I cleared
[3:45:56] funviking99: too casual bad?
[3:46:04] SlithTheSivak: wrath was also peak wow, 12 million subs
[3:46:10] funviking99: lulw
[3:46:18] Splashdownn: im so lost
[3:46:19] TruVillainManny: I don't want to give this conversation air
[3:46:24] RAF_Sean: Imagine walking around this angry about a game that you don't have to play
[3:46:28] CipherNine89: I am going to say, I am one of those casuals and having started in BC I felt like in Wrath I was able to get into heroics and raids for the first time lol
[3:46:42] TruVillainManny: doing 25m w/ 10 raiders is not intended difficulty
[3:46:48] Lheela: early wow was really easy, but players were also really shit at the game
[3:46:50] MachoCham: Cata was famously too hard at release for heroic dungeons
[3:46:50] funviking99: well you can just play something else my dude @evolutions007
[3:46:51] Lheela: so it balanced out
[3:46:59] thunduz: ok ok ok got it they;re saying classic is easy mode and retail is more challenging.....I think
[3:47:04] nyrhalahotep: so I bought some shoes from a drug dealer, not sure what they were laced with, but I've been tripping all day.
[3:47:12] Langsig: Ye i wonder why they cater to the their biggest playerbase, the casuals..
[3:47:17] funviking99: LUL
[3:47:22] MachoCham: 5*
[3:47:26] thunduz: LOL that is hilarious
[3:47:27] MachoCham: Someone gift this man
[3:47:34] Lausten: @evolutions007 Trying to follow what you're on about might be close to rocket science.. LUL
[3:47:38] nyrhalahotep: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:47:41] Hyzen88: @nyrhalahotep permission to steal that joke
[3:47:46] Getleijdx: damn your bag is clean
[3:47:58] funviking99: mrgmG
[3:48:14] RAF_Sean: RAF_Sean gifted a Tier 1 sub to nyrhalahotep! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[3:48:17] TomCat: that makes one of us
[3:48:21] nyrhalahotep: @Hyzen88 I'm an anarchist, what I have is freely given hahaha
[3:48:24] MachoCham: Smells like opinion to me
[3:48:29] TruVillainManny: TY for gifting subs @RAF_Sean
[3:48:42] cutepooh: Is Zygor like Dugi?
[3:48:50] fooxytv: spitting facts bruv mrgmLUL
[3:48:54] RAF_Sean: Banger joke and I'm totally gonna steal it
[3:48:58] funviking99: @evolutions007 what are u even on about man?
[3:48:59] nyrhalahotep: @RAF_Sean Thanks for the gift sub! Hahaahahaha I love making people laugh!
[3:49:01] RAF_Sean: Well deserving of a sub lol
[3:49:01] Lheela: @evolutions007 that sounds very disrespectful
[3:49:13] ThatBlueBot: Classic, BC, and WotLK were hard in a different way than retail. Back in the day you had very few resources, leveling was a grind, and your chances to get gear were lower. Nowadays Blizz ramps up the difficulty of end game content because we have tons of resources available to help our characters get stronger faster. This is my opinion lol played since classic so just what i noticed
[3:49:28] nyrhalahotep: Best chat on the planet!
[3:49:36] funviking99: hard lol
[3:49:40] fooxytv: @evolutions007 don't be disrespectful
[3:49:46] funviking99: classic is not hard

[3:51:23] funviking99: always someone unhappy and angry with the game
[3:51:38] cutepooh: nice!
[3:51:47] cutepooh: yeah, cant tar
[3:52:10] Lheela: speaking of argent tournament... blizz really had a good idea putting unique transmog items on dungeon bosses that have a 50% spawn chance and then those items have a 4% drop rate
[3:52:11] ThatBlueBot: how bout the Halls of Lightning insane damage ramp lol
[3:52:47] Lheela: yes. 26 paletress kills in, still no leather helm
[3:52:49] Lheela: not salty at all btw
[3:52:53] Lausten: @Lheela You know back in Wrath there was no transmog right?
[3:53:09] funviking99: now they respect player time
[3:53:10] MachoCham: Right, I think it's time to park this conversation about if WoW is easy or now. There is a related video here that is a must watch about the whole topic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKP1I7IocYU
[3:53:13] Lheela: yes. still painful to farm right now
[3:53:18] Lausten: Transmog was added with Cataclysm @Lheela
[3:53:23] pvalue01: my 11 year old niece just started playing :D
[3:53:34] RAF_Sean: Yeah without having access to the demographics I'd be comfortable saying that the player base on the whole is older now than it was then
[3:53:35] chefdejour82: yeah I was 20 when I started in Vanilla
[3:53:41] chefdejour82: now 41
[3:53:47] Lheela: @Lausten i know. i played back then
[3:53:47] cutepooh: Yeah my kids started at 9 years old... we all still play as a family.
[3:53:50] m1scl1ck: I wish i started with WOW when i was a kid
[3:53:55] m1scl1ck: now i am 27
[3:54:09] alicemch: hey im 31 years young :')
[3:54:11] Lheela: started at 15, now am 31
[3:54:16] BBMezzy: Based on youtube stats there isn't a large portion of young players interested in WoW
[3:54:18] torpz: im 33 and started when it came out, oldge FeelsBadMan
[3:54:27] cutepooh: My grandson is playing - hes 8.. my granddaughter who is 3 flies my toons around.. lol
[3:54:29] TomCat: I started playing WoW when I was 34
[3:54:30] Nulgar: WoW came out when I was 22, started at 24
[3:54:50] Big_Rum: Most people at blizzcon were 30 and older
[3:54:57] RAF_Sean: I'm a fucking dinosaur lol
[3:55:00] Cyclops_Havok_Vulcan: back then i was playing WoW and Star Wars Galaxies and some times D&D  online on and off
[3:55:07] m1scl1ck: The problem is none of my friends are playing wow
[3:55:08] Lheela: i noticed that i'm getting old when kids don't get southpark references any more
[3:55:09] nyrhalahotep: I follow a ton of young streamers playing   Warcraft, this game isn't going anywhere soon
[3:55:09] bwoods79: When I watc the RWF I always wonder what their youngest players are
[3:55:15] pooma27: i started wow in 2007 and im 62 now :)
[3:55:26] cutepooh: Yeah my grandson watches Roblox and minecraft.
[3:55:39] CipherNine89: Evolution is writing a book and is giving us parts to review
[3:55:40] pvalue01: pikaboo is like 25
[3:55:46] Langsig: My son plays minecraft. Good times
[3:55:49] nyrhalahotep: I'm an old dude so everyone to meet is young haaha
[3:55:51] Iwony: I started when Wow was out half a year and I was almost 30 then :D
[3:55:57] nyrhalahotep: me*
[3:56:05] NeeK_23: my guild has several 20 years actively raiding with us, however they do tend to play more games outside of wow than us older guys
[3:56:05] phyra: I think classic hardcore hit a lot of streamers who dont usually play any wow
[3:56:15] RAF_Sean: I made a Seinfeld reference last night in raid and only 5 people got it. Felt so old
[3:56:29] MachoCham: @RAF_Sean Also was it an EU raid?
[3:56:40] thunduz: online lego is in fortnite
[3:56:40] RAF_Sean: Nah NA
[3:56:43] Lheela: i swear to god if you get the helmet i'm farming i'm going to lose it :D
[3:56:50] RollieRodz: Minecraft as an adult slaps tho
[3:57:01] TruVillainManny: I actually enjoy Fortnite
[3:57:13] TruVillainManny: Never tried Minecraft though
[3:57:16] cutepooh: I wonder how TW will change if they allow it in the follower dungeons. Looking forward to that.
[3:57:23] thunduz: fortnite is a lot of fun
[3:57:31] Getleijdx: Do you have all the mounts from argent tournament
[3:57:33] thunduz: no build is where its at
[3:57:44] ThatBlueBot: once you throw modded minecraft in there its a crazy good game
[3:58:03] Lausten: Minecraft only really became a good game for mem when I started playing with mods..
[3:58:03] Cyclops_Havok_Vulcan: can't wait for Patch 10.2.5 all the stuff coming in that patch
[3:58:12] TruVillainManny: I think Minecraft is selfdirected play. You make your own goals
[3:58:27] chefdejour82: yeah cant wait to dragon ride
[3:58:42] cutepooh: modded minecraft is fun, grandson likes the dragon flying mod
[3:58:43] RAF_Sean: Anyone know where I can find a good video explaining the patch features?

[3:59:25] phyra: ya i like those videos
[3:59:30] chefdejour82: people like them
[3:59:42] BBMezzy: I'm really curious what the untested content of the archives will be. Hope it's substantive and not the same repeating at different locations
[4:00:02] cutepooh: maybe Lausten... we can in DF if you have enough points in your tier.
[4:00:32] RAF_Sean: Follower Dungeons and Archives might be the most hype I've been for non-raid content in a patch yet
[4:00:53] TruVillainManny: I misheard you and now I want Crisp
[4:01:04] chelfx: Just Blues News

[4:17:16] thunduz: does not give country vibes when you see him lol
[4:17:23] Layliah79: Did you see Jelly Roll spoke to congress about the Opoid crisis. He gave a great speech to them.
[4:17:50] cutepooh: yea
[4:18:27] Layliah79: his speech was moving.
[4:18:30] thunduz: I think that's what Prince died from
[4:18:38] cutepooh: might be everywhere - but depends on how easy it is to get it there in the UK. I'm from the USA, so I have no idea how it is there.
[4:18:38] RAF_Sean: prescription yeah
[4:18:47] pvalue01: it's a synthetic opioid that's vastly more potent than heroine ...very dangerous stuff
[4:19:12] MediumRareOG: fentanyl in a synthetic super-powerful opioid. it's cheap to produce so lots of drugs get laced with it. because it's so strong it's so easy to unintentionally die
[4:19:18] Layliah79: I just stumbled across Jelly Roll in the past year. I really enjoy his music. He's got a fantastic voice.
[4:19:20] chefdejour82: Fentanyl is estimated to be 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine
[4:20:01] Layliah79: it's scary!
[4:20:18] MediumRareOG: is andrew callahan still around? didn't he fall off with the sexual misconduct allegations? i haven't seen him for ages
