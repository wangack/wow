[8:31:20] Ezekyler: in Cata was the Talent tree squish and in MoP they changed it to the actual format
[8:31:25] vyjinx: no they are giving new people the chance to experience the old days
[8:31:27] ne0rmatrix: well they need to figure out how to do classic version 2 with a restart of same thing in about 5 years after they get past draenor
[8:31:40] Lonely_piggy_: Classic BfA when? Kappa
[8:31:43] shimwood: When is WoW Classic Classic?

[8:33:13] kekwnano: just bring back the vengeance tank mechanic from MoP
[8:33:16] whytesilver: server are back up all ready?
[8:33:24] CrunkyBrewster: I played last minute of Cata. I took a good time off til the end of it, after MoP was announced
[8:33:29] FalconBroadcasting: So like, All of your should be on different Auras, lol
[8:33:29] DkOlaf95: i don't play classic in the first place soooooo
[8:33:32] PadidinJones: honestly I agree that it should end at Wrath
