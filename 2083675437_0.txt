[0:33:10] aSteamedTomato: they seem to intend to also do tuning and whatnot for the raids
[0:33:14] aSteamedTomato: which takes time
[0:33:31] Felblade: they should do some retail tuning instead
[0:33:34] xsesTV: would be cool to make the loot outrageous good and the raids so hard you need the loot from previous raid to clear it and then just release all tiers at the same time
[0:33:34] aSteamedTomato: it would be impossible to tune them all at the same time when they can't predict the power levels
[0:33:40] Darthvendor: a lot

[0:33:57] Nightbot: Consider subscribing for free with Prime Gaming or at www.twitch.tv/subs/prefoxfox if you enjoy the stream peepoFat peepoCute
[0:34:02] aSteamedTomato: @Felblade dunno, most of us don't play retail.
[0:34:05] vishu_tw: they need to add gear to for the hybrid classes like boomie and prot pala imo
[0:34:33] aSteamedTomato: and we wouldn't be playing retail even if they tuned it. I wasn't aware it wasn't tuned.
[0:36:10] Felblade: its the same as sod
[0:36:14] Felblade: class tuning is always needed
[0:36:36] Felblade: and theyd rather tune sod classes than focus on their MDI/AWC which is their esport
[0:37:41] vishu_tw: they changed crusader strike to holy dmg though

[1:22:22] Alkisfadern: french ppl arent any better
[1:22:33] Alkisfadern: at using eng client
[1:23:09] aSteamedTomato: I think that feeling is affected by seeing so many german item links.

[2:28:26] Creoxx: arent those ashenvale kill quests pick up on kill?
[2:28:42] Pndaa69: at what lv u get di?
[2:29:31] global_shift: I tried looking it up. (I might be wrong since I never played cata). But chain lighting hits 6 targets and has a 3s CD in cata. and you can glyph it to hit an additional 2 targets. But deals 10% less initial dmg.
[2:29:53] global_shift: 8 targets tho is pretty hot no?
[2:30:24] Elmesioo: Pressing 2 buttons is too hard. Prefox needs 1 only.
[2:30:56] gomezcs2: there is a spell or soemthing that makes it have no cd, so u walk around perma CL - insane dps and fun
[2:31:10] Elmesioo: No idea. Not talked to them yet.
[2:31:43] global_shift: Found more into - Elemental Fury now removes the cooldown from your Chain Lightning spell.
[2:32:05] Creoxx: talent maybe
[2:32:12] global_shift: Talent yes
[2:32:43] fossland: aaaa UNLIMITED POWER
[2:32:46] gomezcs2: its like the guy from starwars, the emperor just CL'ing the entire raid
[2:32:47] Creoxx: + you get earthquake
[2:33:23] masterxd69: i wish they just sent prepatch now
[2:33:26] masterxd69: i want to play ele again
[2:33:29] global_shift: And - Unleashed Lightning Allows Lightning Bolt to be cast while moving.
[2:33:39] masterxd69: the sound of constant clearcast and doing chain is just so much fun
[2:33:46] gomezcs2: found a video https://youtu.be/SXseocIRGuo?t=24
