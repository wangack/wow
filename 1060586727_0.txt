[2:01:00] FatBuffaloSlugBait: is it bad that i enjoyed cata? LUL
[2:01:02] Affiiance: For the first time since Wrath.... Our raid team isnt coming back if that tells you anything
[2:01:06] nisk___: ok now we have confirmarion that this guy is trolling
[2:01:07] SonofHorus82: lol my man said Shadowlands is the best xpac ever like TBC, Wrath, MOP, and Legion dont exist.
[2:01:12] CrunkyBrewster: not not at all FatBuffaloSlugBait
[2:01:13] nisk___: calling SL world content immense
[2:01:14] JerBoody: If you don’t raid or pvp you don’t really play WoW 😮
[2:01:29] Merex760: Cata was good and I'll die on that hill. Dragon Soul was just disappointing
[2:01:36] wizards_0f_zargon: the best bro.....theyre expanding they just need to adjust the leveling experience
[2:01:45] nisk___: yeah you trollin
[2:01:51] AliaraStormforged: Oh looks like those ASMR girls got banned, little victories

[2:02:10] wizards_0f_zargon: in 5 years we will love shadowlands
[2:02:16] nisk___: world quests are longer and less rewarding than ever
[2:02:16] Biotechz: @Merex760 I enjoyed Cata up to the point where the first tier of raiding lasted like 8 months?
[2:02:18] CrunkyBrewster: yeah god damn it. i fell for it didnt i?
[2:02:20] tebbix: he is trolling lol
[2:02:26] Contractual_: wrong expansion kid
[2:02:27] Affiiance: I really do think FFXIV is better, and this is coming from someone who plays WoW still bc thats where my friends are
[2:02:28] CrunkyBrewster: i was all being positive and shit
[2:02:39] generalmarcus35: shadowlands classic in 20 more years
[2:02:53] Merex760: I'm subbed to both FF14 and WoW right now and FF14 definitely gets the lion's share of my time
[2:02:58] nisk___: wotlk will be the last classic id bet my car on it
[2:03:13] Affiiance: Shadowlands is literally worse than WoD.... think about that
[2:03:17] CrunkyBrewster: I'm actually really enjoying FF14 right now. doing the Realm Reborn leveling and I think it's good for all basic the quests are
[2:03:20] JerBoody: I enjoyed Cata for 3 weeks until all the wrath babies cried about heroic dungeons were too hard and they got nerfed to wrath”difficultly”
[2:03:26] spekktrum19: I’m still holding out hope that SL is a filler xpac for 10.0 and Blizz is focusing most of its resources to that like they did with Legion
[2:03:29] d1stract10n: that was a change they added after BT
[2:03:29] manmower: are you saying WoD put out more content than SL?
[2:03:33] wizards_0f_zargon: bro ima grown man bro,  listen to me shadowlands is good ,  people like to look to the future rather than enjoy the now

[2:03:49] tebbix: the only thing I'm doing on retail rn is farming the fox from Legion
[2:03:51] nisk___: @shy_rack_demons youve been exposed my dude, stop tryin now
[2:04:04] MightyBone_Yumuros: SL isn't that bad just the content drought makes it unenjoyable and the constant grind elements
[2:04:06] CrunkyBrewster: i got a while before i get there lol
[2:04:06] Merex760: I'm still on Stormblood. But it's very good
[2:04:18] Merex760: I can't wait for Shadowbringers
[2:04:27] manmower: the exciting part about SL is we're finally going to get rid of Anduin, he's gonna be replaced with Manduin
[2:04:32] Renzay83: are you going to prioritize SL over tbc? @Towelliee
[2:04:51] Anguyen92ab: I think there are a fair amount of leaks to SL, but I enjoyed the first raid.  Also, I made like 6.8 million gold this expansion so far, so I'm having a good time by default.
[2:05:09] Anguyen92ab: That stated, I'm actually enjoying TBC more at the moment.

[3:00:02] soulbr0: it was straight up softcore porn
[3:00:05] iLLW1LL: Is that a preset on the report function. Farting into mic? feels like you gotta right that one in other?
[3:00:08] Aidler: twitch lost controll

[3:01:05] Kinghorn: we just finished up ours, had time for netherspite this week PrideLionYay
[3:01:22] yunggluten: What if the Hot tub section was just to filter out the extremes and make it easier to ban? 5Head

[3:03:53] Stres89: @generalmarcus35 wtf... LOL
[3:03:55] Aidler: it was absolutly predictable that the hot tub streamers will not vanish quietly into the night...
[3:04:21] BlueBeast33: They probably would have if people weren't speaking up
[3:04:23] carboncoral: the people doing those streams are earning twitch so much money so I doubt twitch will ever do anything about it
[3:04:23] Kinghorn: so seems like I missed a lot while raiding, why are hot tub streamers being talked about again
[3:04:36] rsimpson105: lmfao
[3:04:37] Slayd11: ya they took over it for views
[3:04:38] BeaRNaKKeD: well the one is now promoting her onlyfans, you know she's making bank tonight
[3:04:38] rsimpson105: what a trip
[3:04:43] soulbr0: its fine if they want to allow porn on twitch but thats what it was becoming
[3:04:43] zekobunny: Yeah I feel like they find thrill in walking the fine line, like a sport LUL
[3:04:45] iLLW1LL: it went beyond kids, beyond adults, it was heading in a very strange direction
[3:05:03] Colt_Engineer: legit asmr helped me with a lot of my depression an anxiety, but the ear eating stuff is stupid
[3:05:08] BlueBeast33: It's kinda disappointing, I discovered ASMR about 10 years ago and none of this crap was going on
[3:05:20] MysticalOS: @BeaRNaKKeD thaht's affectively what they've always used twitch for. a platform to advertise OF without actually saying it. a sort of "like what you see, there is more somewhere else wink wink"
[3:05:27] KrustytheClown68: She fart on the mic then started licking the same side she farted on..... like wtf

[3:06:32] Aidler: I'm just glad that Towelliee has no need to resort to weired ASMR - swiftyHappy
[3:06:48] Dodeca: so who got banned for that now? ... lol
[3:06:53] KrustytheClown68: right!
[3:06:59] AceOfTheNorth: The thing is, Twitch has a requirement to apply rules evenly so they have to work to create the line so that one streamer can wear a tank top but another streamer can't be sexual.
[3:07:03] ChuckNurrish: or go all in on an Onlyfans page and stay out of twitch
[3:07:07] MysticalOS: tomorrow "Announcing new catagoring, 'alternative and taboo ASMR'"
[3:07:20] AceOfTheNorth: and some streamers definitely find a way around that line
[3:07:24] ZooNamiii: game on a gaming site Kappa
[3:07:32] ChalupaBatman25: i have no sympathy for them getting banned but hey props to them trying to exploit horn dogs on twitch without having to do full on porn on onlyfans
[3:07:35] zekobunny: Twitch is not a gaming site for a loooong time now
[3:07:38] Aidler: @ChuckNurrish right... thats what onlyfans is for. twitch is not the platform for that weired shit
[3:07:40] Marmoh: No they'll just make OF their primary advertising space, which honestly good on them, it's like 90% of their income
[3:07:53] Broomba: lots of gaming streamers are on full attack mode against twitch about the hot tubs, asmr, etc!! its going to get interesting.
[3:08:18] MackAttack1421: This isn't onlyfans... Why do they need that shit on here?
[3:08:23] NVbrutal: its all about money as long as twitch is getting money from people subbing to those streamers they wont change it.
[3:09:07] iLLW1LL: Stonewall formation
[3:09:25] Dodeca: lets be honest that hottubs tag its the most retarded option implemented by twitch so far but its a good way to catch and ban the most problematic streams about it
[3:09:26] ChuckNurrish: now would be a good time to start a "hottub" streaming service, not unlike twitch, for people like that. possible business venture, lol
[3:09:39] Sollice: @ChuckNurrish I just said that to Katie
[3:09:47] MissyKib: I follow a streamer who has an OF but she blocks or kicks anyone who brings it up she says she comes to twitch to game and there seperate entities so she treats em that way pretty much
[3:10:02] SolisOne: it only matters if you are a bigger streamer if anything happens to you
[3:10:09] duen75: pornhub going to start up a 'gaming' section lol
[3:10:12] iLLW1LL: Was it really about the hot tubs tho, or was the interest that the hot tubs were taking over the face of twitch
[3:10:27] iLLW1LL: pretty sure the other services exist already
