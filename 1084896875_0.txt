[1:19:25] Aervyper: don't like realistic MMO's... If you like or want Ashes why aren't you playing BDO?
[1:19:27] Archiee: Why would you even need housing in WoW?

[1:19:51] GodslnHisHeaven: It's just an RPG element, not really an mmorpg without rpg elements
[1:19:51] AndrewShifuVA: what does housing mean?
[1:19:55] DiranJei: Why are y'all acting like garrison werent a thing rn

[1:20:06] Saerol: DAoC had great housing for how basic it was, forced people to visit them to sell/buy on their version of the auction house

[1:20:08] Bayne77: i think guild housing in wow would be cool but thats about it
[1:20:15] thrasnerv: @Aervyper also bdo is p2w and grindy af. ashes sounds it will not be either of those
[1:20:23] Aervyper: @thrasnerv i like WoW / Wildstar graphic style over realistic
[1:20:23] Velashen: Well they should. No excuses for either.
[1:20:26] CantHealz: why do ppl wait at thise?
[1:20:28] toobaked1987: @Towelliee getting to this new raid is very annoying
[1:20:32] Epiclurker27893: I would love to SEE FF 14 style housing in WOW, just for the pure rage and tears of everyone spending months trying to get a house. PopCorn PopCorn PopCorn
[1:20:42] thrasnerv: @Aervyper me too . but ashes doesnt look realistic, it looks a bit more realistic than wow thats it
[1:20:45] Archiee: i think the combat system would need a decent overhaul in order for PvP to work well in FF
[1:21:00] GodslnHisHeaven: bdo is p2w if you have thousands of dollars to dump. Real end game players are not whales, they're no lives who spend day and night grinding
[1:21:17] toobaked1987: They can just add a flight point like we get to the other places in the maw
[1:21:20] thrasnerv: @GodslnHisHeaven thats worse than being p2w honestly
[1:21:24] Bayne77: yeah thats pretty telling, players have to kill themselves to get to a raid
[1:21:26] Aervyper: is BDO P2W worse than Raid?
[1:21:37] WallyJustice: funny every one was vengeance now everyone is guardian
[1:21:38] Epiclurker27893: Isn't the entrance near Korthia? it's seems to be around the corner from this weeks world boss.
[1:21:59] adorabych: Wow this zone looks drab and depressing, I absolutely hate it. I get that’s kind of what they wanted but...ew
[1:22:25] Truedusk: Truedusk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 91 months, currently on a 91 month streak! 
[1:22:29] Velashen: I think housing would enrich wow beyond just building systems that are abandoned after each expansion.
[1:22:43] GodslnHisHeaven: 99% of the things in BDO are earnable by playing
[1:22:46] gfield2k: gfield2k subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[1:22:51] Bayne77: well. i mean. you ARE in hell. so drab and depressing is probably as good as it gets there :D
[1:22:58] Archiee: in order for pvp to work "well" you have to be able to react to things... FF doesn't really allow that from my experience. FF is like a choreographed dance with its combat... You need a mosh pit to pvp lol
[1:23:05] thrasnerv: @GodslnHisHeaven the catch is, by playing how much?
[1:23:07] chukudu: chukudu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! <3 you T-man
[1:23:23] adorabych: Yeah I’ll go back to playing ff where the devs are not literally trying to tell players go to hell. Good luck
[1:23:38] iamtheonlycdn: i dont see a viable way to include housing
[1:23:44] Aervyper: @Towelliee blizzard took one look at how EQ2 housing sucked and threw that idea in the garbage long long ago
[1:23:49] gfield2k: Damn guess my 10x wasn’t enough 🤣
[1:24:02] GodslnHisHeaven: it's "p2w" because end game gear is hard to get, paying will get you there faster but it costs thousands @thrasnerv. If you wanted to earn a full pen boss set (which is essentially end game) it'd probably take a year to get to without paying

[1:24:43] thrasnerv: @GodslnHisHeaven the overall feeling from bdo, is grind until you can become stronger and grind stronger enemies. i really dont see the end game point especially now where guilds fight for territory like every 3 months.
[1:24:56] Andalaidor: whats the current renown cap?
[1:25:37] vexprime: !addon

[1:25:42] GodslnHisHeaven: Well the end game in BDO is PvP which I haven't got to, but apparently people consider it THE best mmo PvP
[1:26:01] GodslnHisHeaven: but I get where you're coming from
[1:26:01] Supers18: I saw quin jumping on the FF14 hype as well
[1:26:03] thrasnerv: @GodslnHisHeaven if it didnt drop to 20 fps then yes, it would probably be the best.
[1:26:12] thrasnerv: @GodslnHisHeaven but, to be honest. i also love wow's pvp
[1:26:22] GodslnHisHeaven: Yeah, tab targeting is arguable lol
[1:26:28] Bayne77: are they... savage? Kappa
[1:26:39] GodslnHisHeaven: But i did play WoW for 8 years
[1:26:41] Archiee: he def didn't have many nice things to say about it lol
[1:26:52] Archiee: he enjoyed the char creation though LUL
[1:27:09] thrasnerv: @GodslnHisHeaven classic wow is my paradise right now. perfect balance of beautiful graphics, hard leveling and amazing end game.
[1:27:36] Andalaidor: went from renown 33 to 42 today lmao
[1:27:38] thrasnerv: @GodslnHisHeaven cant even play shadowlands after the massive grind i had to do for anima. sl is not like wow anymore

[1:28:23] Veruhn: so sylvanas has been killed off now lore wise?
[1:28:29] Supers18: dropped off a cliff
[1:28:34] Archiee: the devs lost their love for making the game maybe?
[1:28:54] GodslnHisHeaven: Yeah, BDO is an extreme MMO. There is SOOOO much to do and SOOO many ways to spend time doing random stuff. It's almost overwhelming so it's definitely not for everyone but I will say that I'm in love
[1:29:32] GodslnHisHeaven: I stopped playing Shadowlands after they re-introduced valor haha, I didn't want to grind my 220 ilvl all over again @thrasnerv
[1:30:59] thrasnerv: @GodslnHisHeaven you playing bdo right now?
[1:31:15] Supers18: Towelliee but there are 603 guilds on KT
[1:31:22] GodslnHisHeaven: I am, I've been playing for about two months every day now lol @thrasnerv
[1:31:23] Archiee: Ony hella heard that LUL
[1:31:24] Supers18: so just Sylv being a cock block
[1:31:27] RomeoMiike: you set off my siri lol

[1:31:32] KristineTheUnicorn: Hows Ony without her mom? towOny
[1:31:33] Archiee: She all looked over like 8!?!?!?!?

[1:59:52] JesikaPlays: what makes people think sargerus would even help us??
[2:00:03] Catspaw66: I could see Elune show up and lay the beat down on the Jailer then slap Malfurian around for doing nothing
[2:00:40] OnyxLair77: i think it will be a battle of all the wow races coming together to kill the jailer.
[2:00:48] bantuatha: Meanwhile C'thun and Yagg' srom still prison
[2:00:52] ShinyLox: So happy that Lula is going to be casting the RWF! <3

[2:22:31] Madox99: Hey whats up @Towelliee how are you doing?
[2:22:59] Minifurnace: maybe with other games too, like FFXIV
[2:23:20] Madox99: Have they said anything about sylvanas yet?
[2:23:23] TheUnknowing: WoW community in RFW is a niche community any ways, no big company like that would do that.
[2:23:25] Minifurnace: WoW + FFXIV world firsts.. so it increase the frequency of them
[2:23:39] GodslnHisHeaven: I wonder how Towlliee will defend the next lack of content when Covid isn't around
[2:23:40] Anguyen92ab: It's very fragmented
[2:24:09] Broomba: towJoe
[2:24:26] Broomba: @GodslnHisHeaven what are some good Bellular stock to buy?

[2:25:11] Anguyen92ab: I'm only at 68 in TBC
[2:25:21] Catspaw66: So how long into 9.1 before Belluar goes back to ff 14 content creation ?
[2:25:29] VidulaSaix: 1 day
[2:25:34] idenkaz_: we're in the mids of a literal game changer in the most literal way. bad or good but it will filter out the playerbase. i don't think there is a we go back to the roots route. just enjoy what this game is, a service game.

[2:26:06] Moobot: @Madox99 No, Towelliee has not seen the Sylvanas cutscene yet. He is waiting until he actually beats the raid to watch it.
[2:26:07] VidulaSaix: Yes
[2:26:07] RoboMaximillion: 1-2 days
[2:26:12] Anguyen92ab: At this point, everyone should have an idea of what this game is nowadays, take it or leave it.
[2:26:37] VidulaSaix: 14's stuff doesn't tend to be gear gated anymore so it's just a matter of executing them proper
[2:26:42] Anguyen92ab: Otherwise, complaining about it ad nauseum is tiring and you have me calling people Jabronis.
[2:26:46] CritcobainTV: Reeee! Apparently the electric company is going to have the electric off for 4 hour stomorrow morning. 6-10 PST for maintenance
[2:26:49] CritcobainTV: 😡
[2:26:52] GrizlyInsertion: @Towelliee, if i change covenants, about how do you think it will take me to get back to my renown lvl of 45?
[2:27:01] GrizlyInsertion: how long*
[2:27:17] Neldur: you get renown by doing just about anything. So within a couple days?
[2:27:19] D3m0nHunt3r666: @Critcobain so no morning stream?
[2:27:22] Madox99: maby 1 dat
[2:27:24] Madox99: day*
[2:27:34] CritcobainTV: @D3m0nHunt3r666 Seems like that's a big no. *sigh*
[2:27:38] mathvibes: is renown capped at 45 rn I am new sorry
[2:27:38] jbmoongirl: Ewwww @critcobain I hope it’s not hot where you live
[2:27:42] ShinyLox: Just switched today and Its possible to do it within a week if you grind
[2:27:43] Madox99: for me it went really fast
[2:27:46] Bobbyk866: i got to lvl 32 in 2.5 days
[2:27:48] CritcobainTV: @jbmoongirl it is lol
[2:27:53] Tru1485: if you have the time you can get most of the renown in a day
[2:28:06] jbmoongirl: Oh no…..you have my sympathies @critcobain
[2:29:03] Minifurnace: haha endbringers.. sick
[2:29:06] VidulaSaix: The Savage comes out like Xmas week though
[2:29:18] Minifurnace: haha thats a sick name tho
[2:29:26] D3m0nHunt3r666: @Critcobain big fat rip
[2:30:24] Icyroark: big D dps
[2:30:42] CritcobainTV: this dps KEKW
[2:30:53] happybooger: he says that... but i dont know
[2:30:54] GrizlyInsertion: looks like I am going to be switching to kyrian from venthyr.
[2:31:05] CritcobainTV: You i saw your tweets, looked like you had a good time LUL
[2:31:08] meaniehead17: how long will the rwf likely take considering so few guilds even have aotc yet? sylvanas seems buggy af and blizz will likely have to work on the fight as guilds are making their attempts
[2:31:19] BigHardee: thoughts on the new affix?

[2:33:03] BigHardee: would you say adding new anima powers every month would help the affix ?
[2:33:09] CritcobainTV: it's super passive and you kind of forget about it. the powers don't change your play style at all
[2:33:22] VidulaSaix: Plumage is the only power that feels fun

[2:37:52] Strouss: i assume Hammer squad Territory?
[2:38:36] Avin0x: I couldn't get past FF beginning, I like GW2 combat and questing but it's endgame is sheet. ESO's combat is boring. I couldn't get myself to play Tera or SWTOR. I miss Wildstar and Rift got ruined.
[2:38:52] Broomba: thinking of getting new world -- cant decide on steam or through the company website
[2:39:02] Avin0x: I would lol
[2:39:05] Avin0x: I enjoyed it
[2:39:10] VidulaSaix: Trust me, you didn't "miss" WIldstar
[2:39:12] VidulaSaix: LUL
[2:39:21] Avin0x: I think people stopped playing it because people weren't playing it.
[2:39:23] nimeon01: Wildstar OMEGALUL
[2:39:27] KravenStormGaming: If RIFT didn't go P2W, I'd still be playing it, I was with it since alpha
[2:39:28] SteelEm: spellslinger arenas kind of fun xD
[2:39:35] VidulaSaix: Rift was really good though
[2:39:49] nimeon01: I tried leveling in that game I couldnt do it it was so boring with abilities covering the full screen making the action combat so pointless
[2:39:56] Broomba: i was thinking of playing WS before it went free to play and when it went to free to play, but was too late
[2:39:57] MoMoFoSh0: Are you running Mythic+?
