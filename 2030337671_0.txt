[0:06:08] wolfcloudchaser80: Looks like it's the same temperature here as it is in Victoria.
[0:06:33] Elrathir: I dinged 70 on my tauren shaman today PogChamp
[0:06:38] jgbrit: -10 there? It'll be +7 for us tomorrow
[0:06:45] WhippWhapp: o/ from Calgary, pretty chilly here- feels like -46C with windchill
[0:07:03] cashthb: waddup
[0:07:14] jeffdmk: yeah it is slightly chilly today
[0:07:23] ferretclaws: cozy stream today
[0:07:33] cashthb: what outside cats do in that weather?
[0:07:39] claymoregaming04: i wanna be a gnome paladin
[0:07:52] Elrathir: 25 chars at max, only 35 to go Kappa
[0:07:53] azrazil720: fun fact, Celsius and Fahrenheit meet at -40 🙃
[0:07:58] eielwind: i love that mount
[0:08:02] goplacidly56: Nice!
[0:08:02] cashthb: no, too pink
[0:08:02] Ryok: hello hazel and chat merodyHey in the beginning of yesterdays stream you said how there's no moonbeast mounts aside from the vicious one, but there is one from the store 👀
[0:08:15] nyrhalahotep: so I bought some shoes from a drug dealer, not sure what they were laced with, but I've been tripping all day. 😶
[0:08:21] MerlinYensid: Ooh pretty mount!
[0:08:22] wolfcloudchaser80: I want to be a gnome druid. Use a killer ferret as cat form.
[0:08:41] Elrathir: o deer
[0:08:49] WhippWhapp: I just hit 17million gold in wow, my highest ever! It would be higher but I bought 4 copies of Diablo4 when that launched, so it set me back millions, plus I have not been that active in DF
[0:08:53] jgbrit: It's literally mitzy without the nose
[0:08:54] Zuldak: no terrible achieves this time? No stupid frog hopping around or annoying jumping Djaran?
[0:08:55] eielwind: tomorrow is a squirt day (not super squirt), is it still the best option to level pets even without the super bonus?
[0:09:17] brad1575: Tindral achievement was annoying. We had to use a macro
[0:09:30] eielwind: I NEED HIM
[0:09:33] goplacidly56: omg lol love that
[0:09:35] jeffdmk: he quacks me up
[0:09:36] azrazil720: QUACKERS!! I want
[0:09:39] cashthb: how is he holding the sword?
[0:09:48] SquiggySquonk: OMG
[0:09:49] nyrhalahotep: mage magic shrunk a bucket
[0:09:51] TotallyNotRaien: he has burned a pillaged before, he is a war criminal
[0:10:16] cashthb: what?

[0:10:28] HeyRed1368: Use biscuit on it!
[0:10:54] F4TB0NGR1PZ: the quackers one was much more annoying for my group because it was pretty buggy
[0:11:06] Cyberwolffe: In my area in Northern Missouri, we are going to be under a Wind Chill Warning starting at 6PM tonight and lasting until Noon on Tuesday.  And the extended forecast says that it won't be back above freezing until the 22nd of this month.
[0:11:42] CamyK22: Been having a lot of issues in game recently. Hopefully and uninstall and reinstall works
[0:11:48] goplacidly56: I didnt know that
[0:11:52] brad1575: I wonder if it is determined by your character size like with mounts
[0:11:54] CamyK22: *an
[0:12:15] thunderwings_wow: They're doing something similar with shaman elementals in the new patch, shaman elementals will look smaller to everyone but them
[0:12:19] ghostie1995: Oohh do you have the micro helicid pet?
[0:12:26] ghostie1995: that one is smol

[0:12:57] Rendwee: The whelps from the daycare are really big
[0:12:58] cashthb: all od the whelps
[0:12:58] ghostie1995: soo cute I wonder how much smaller it is to others lol
[0:13:10] play_stacia: do all pets appear larger to the player or is just ivy?
[0:13:34] sence_00: Drakks is the big dragon
[0:13:39] jgbrit: Isn't the diablo pet huge?
[0:13:43] sence_00: hes probably as tall as your gnome
[0:13:47] Vallheyv: Hi Hazel, would you recommend any rp realm ?
[0:13:50] Cyberwolffe: I know that the Warlock demons sizes scale based on your character level could the battle pets do the same thing based on their level?
[0:14:13] eielwind: the MoonGuard goldshire inn is...a special place
[0:14:22] cashthb: rp realms should not shard, so that should be pretty important
[0:14:28] goplacidly56: lol
[0:14:33] TotallyNotRaien: that would be a vary smart feature for visual bloat
[0:14:36] wolfcloudchaser80: Many RP realms are very low population. Moonguard has more people... but it has a certain reputation
[0:14:51] BlueeyedBeast98: cthuffer is also pretty big
[0:14:51] WhippWhapp: WhippWhapp watched 10 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:15:05] cashthb: here we go with 24h streams again...
[0:15:43] WhippWhapp: Do you ever do RBG's @HazelNuttyGames ?
[0:16:00] cashthb: wait 5s are gone? :O
[0:16:02] unronlenting: what add on do you use for your pets?
[0:16:16] HeyRed1368: new brawl is actually good
[0:16:16] TheNekromancer: What an AMAZING mog, Hazel! BibleThump
[0:16:18] eielwind: blitz is just to complete it not even win, that one is usually worth doing
[0:16:36] Hippwn: honestly I kind of like doing blitz as a healer plus they are fast at least
[0:17:03] eielwind: they DID fix it :(
[0:17:13] one_billion_horses: Ooohhhh that why
[0:17:34] amaya21: hey hazel! loooove the pink wig!!
[0:17:37] amaya21: <3
[0:17:41] anduinwindrunner: I finished those tour of duty quests by picking up war caches, it's a dangerous way to do it, but hey I love danger.
[0:17:51] eielwind: oh geez 2 havocs
[0:18:37] jgbrit: Hazel, is there a way to buy flawless battle stones in the Eastern Kingdoms?
[0:18:46] BlueeyedBeast98: which addon is calling out abilities?
[0:19:37] Airt1: you can solo them as a ret paladin
[0:19:47] anduinwindrunner: I completed research meta achievement today so I'm NEVER going there again.
[0:20:03] cashthb: @jgbrit i don't know about anyway to get, btw how did you end up in a situation where you need them specifically from the eastern kingdom?
[0:20:13] Rendwee: I only need 2 more of the order Hall mounts, I was working on it before the season started and then I've been busy with the new stuff
[0:20:27] HeyRed1368: Have you seen new achievement for wining 50 solo shuffles as a healer above 1800 rating? It awards Battle Mender title
[0:20:44] jgbrit: @cashthb I'm just collecting and levelling in order of zones oldest to newest
[0:21:22] Ujai321: morning
[0:21:59] jgbrit: Ah okay thanks. I know you can trade 3 of one type for one of another. Where do you get yours?
[0:22:08] cashthb: maybe you can get them at the pet battle dungeon quest givers, but I'm just theory crafting
[0:22:23] Ujai321: were you informed already that there is, in fact, already a moonbeast mount? a shop mount, but still
[0:22:26] Fausstty: Hello. Happy Friday
[0:22:29] HeyRed1368: I don’t think it’s currently account wide but it surely will be in War within
[0:23:39] Fausstty: I wanna get into arenas but I can't
[0:23:40] Saiyori: AAh, the yolo yuffle my beloved
[0:23:59] Fausstty: I only play warrior and I barely know what other classes do
[0:24:30] janahita: When does this season end?
[0:24:50] Fausstty: March, I believe?
[0:24:52] ghostie1995: true. I currently have 71 marks whereas two years ago I would of thought it impossible for me to
[0:24:58] cashthb: @Fausstty lot of bgs can help with that too
[0:25:14] HeyRed1368: It’s healer bonus dds get average amount of honor
[0:25:17] Ujai321: dang man, just dumpstering the other healer
[0:25:44] zetsumi103: what did I walk into btw hi hazel
[0:26:00] Rendwee: The trick is to disable chat lol
[0:26:00] sence_00: my problem is i could never break 1000 rating and it was too annoying to have no shot at the mount
[0:26:06] Fausstty: I mean, I know they can do stuff, I just don't understand how it seems they can do everything
[0:26:07] ghostie1995: I’m probably gonna go in pressing buttons like Wild lol
[0:26:12] Fausstty: And I only got a stun and a fear
[0:26:20] ghostie1995: to much on the screen makes me go burrr
[0:26:50] eielwind: i am also chipping away at mine for weks, still only at 35%, but dps queue makes me sad
[0:27:26] Ujai321: compared to PvE, where the incentive is "get better gear", would you say PvP is its own reward?
[0:27:30] amaya21: pink really suits you! can't wait to see the 3rd wig!
[0:27:38] cashthb: wasn't that high for a while, but it stopped being toxic around 2k back in my day, getting past the hardstuck tryhards toxicity dissipates
[0:28:13] Hippwn: pvp is number goes up feels good i guess lol
[0:28:18] Fausstty: Gear is pretty much a given in both PvE and PvP, for a lot of people
[0:28:34] enviouscat: Watching your enemies fall before you ?
[0:28:50] ghostie1995: mounts and tmogs
[0:28:53] cashthb: curbstomping lowbies was my jam, to bad scaling kinda ruined it - you still do but not to the same extent
[0:29:04] Ujai321: was your move carried by flabby?
[0:29:16] aerohokie: aerohokie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[0:29:16] Streamlabs: aerohokie just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:29:33] eielwind: i am trying to be better at disc priest in solo shuffle, kind of stuck around 1250 atm
[0:29:33] MrSonicgen: Hello.
[0:29:43] Saiyori: Just remember, anything you lose you already gained once, and so you know you can gain it again
[0:29:52] themaykr_: yeah… league turns me into a different person
[0:30:12] Ujai321: @Saiyori that's what i say to myself while gambling Kappa
[0:30:32] Saiyori: @Ujai321 hahaha I don't gamble, ijust play pvp
[0:30:35] eielwind: its a BG but u move faster
[0:30:41] strwbrysabs: bg but faster
[0:30:41] eielwind: and theres 8 people instead of 10
[0:30:46] themaykr_: I am already enraged that you have long boi and I don’t
[0:31:02] cashthb: prolly you should get the flag as a drood
[0:31:12] Elrathir: I once lost all six rounds of a Solo Shuffle queue twice in a row, that felt baaad. Haven't mustered the courage to go back in yet
[0:31:51] Ujai321: "i think we are just brawling" is my general BG experience
[0:32:08] eielwind: im with you and mostly want the mount so as long as im above 1000 im ok
[0:32:20] Ryok: i once queued for solo shuffle... saw 14 minute average wait time and told myself "nah i already have an owlbear i'm good" xD
[0:32:42] Ujai321: oh we are ahead, let's go
[0:33:17] WatchingYouGames: Hazel!!! panikuHug how is pvp ???
[0:33:25] cashthb: 10 man 'stead of 20
[0:33:28] eielwind: you just move faster
[0:33:34] WhippWhapp: Go, Hazel... GOOOOOO! PogChamp
[0:33:35] Ujai321: it is 8 instead of 10 per side, so that is something, i guess
[0:33:59] cashthb: close enough
[0:34:32] Ujai321: do you know if flabby has a DK?
[0:35:11] Ujai321: he could be casting FLABBY HANDS
[0:35:16] cashthb: ask for cookie
[0:35:22] Ujai321: the things that amuse me sometimes...
[0:35:32] eielwind: sigh my cringe...
[0:35:33] eielwind: lol
[0:36:08] MrSonicgen: :D
[0:36:15] eielwind: its just flying aroudn to different zones
[0:36:18] cashthb: no sense of bleing close to the carrier if noone bothers it
[0:36:22] Ujai321: those sure are words you just said
[0:36:25] Elrathir: 84 years
[0:36:25] helheimr: you can do it in under one hour i think, its just flying
[0:36:26] wolfcloudchaser80: Easily done in one stream
[0:36:29] jeffdmk: 5 mins Kappa
[0:36:32] zantos2020: not very long, like an hour for 10 of them
[0:36:33] Hippwn: 20 min maybe lol
[0:36:34] eielwind: wowhead would have coordinates, not sure if they have a good order
[0:36:40] LKatey75: Hello all!
[0:36:45] BlueeyedBeast98: if you just look up the coordinates probably at most an hour
[0:36:45] sence_00: rumour mill is really fast if you follow wowhead
[0:36:49] cashthb: 1-2 stream should be enough
[0:36:52] Ujai321: i'm sure it makes sense, just not to me
[0:36:58] taylorette: 23m healing dang!
[0:37:11] LKatey75: is it cold down there?
[0:37:29] marbared: Ya, you were may more healing than everyone else combined in that BG
[0:37:32] Ujai321: "come back, we could be parsing!" doesnt look at the parses, smh
[0:37:34] LKatey75: C? it's -7 C here right now
[0:37:37] CamyK22: If you wait until next week the flying around the old world will be SUPER fast
[0:37:40] SultryVoice: Its -10 where my brother is at in Montana with a wind chill of -35
[0:37:40] themaykr_: road was so icy yesterday I almost broke my leg 70 times
[0:37:49] wolfcloudchaser80: Rumor mill is generally very straightforward. One or two (like one in Grizzly Hills) does involve a sequence of events.
[0:38:17] Ujai321: the other question is, if you do that later, what do you do now
[0:38:36] themaykr_: there wasn’t any snow, just ice
[0:38:43] LKatey75: we're supposed to get more snow sunday, maybe
[0:38:46] oohGOTEM: would you say the cold never bothered him anyway? @HazelNuttyGames
[0:38:53] LKatey75: but we've really had enough
[0:39:06] TheVirginian: super easy conquest
[0:40:15] Ujai321: you have been dabbling in mogs all this time and never told anybody!?
[0:40:21] aerohokie: -11 here, no major wind chill tho thankfully
[0:40:30] exalted1715: do we know if the dragon lego will be useable  and upgradeable next season?
[0:40:38] ghostie1995: aspirant gear can be bought with marks later after the expansion right?
[0:40:48] brazkat: @exalted1715 it will not
[0:40:58] jgbrit: @ujai321 LUL LUL
[0:40:59] m3shu: have you ever considered vtubing?
[0:41:03] Ujai321: community rumority
[0:41:09] exalted1715: :(
[0:41:20] exalted1715: what about the axe lego?
[0:41:24] rivalintrainingg: Cheer100 I only play Wow for TW am i a casual?
[0:41:25] Streamlabs: rivalintrainingg has donated 100 bits!
[0:41:34] themaykr_: too late
[0:41:35] brazkat: @exalted1715 unless they magically add something but as of right now neither leggo will carry over
[0:41:43] themaykr_: face unreveal
[0:42:03] exalted1715: blegh, what a waste. legos should be good the whole patch they are aquired in :(
[0:42:03] Ujai321: plot twist: the third wig is an avatar
[0:42:05] brazkat: What achieve are you working on
[0:42:16] seamuscg: aww
[0:42:36] wolfcloudchaser80: And by the way, you don't even need to collect all the satchels to get Tobias.
[0:42:38] jgbrit: I don't watch vtubers in find it less personal. I watch streamers for the streamer, the content is a bonus
[0:42:40] ShaggyPhil: he gets a cute hat when you actually summon him
[0:42:43] themaykr_: @hazelnuttygames do you currently play any other games besides wow
[0:42:57] Lheela: aww its the doggo that spams the inventory of every single character on your account with his leash
[0:44:05] Lheela: at least it used to, i think they fixed it now
[0:44:09] seamuscg: that baby dragon sitting next to  u
[0:44:29] brazkat: is it bad im redoing loremaster on my actual favorite toon?
[0:45:02] Ujai321: @brazkat you do you, nothing wrong with it
[0:45:04] sence_00: hyjal
[0:45:10] CamyK22: The ones that require multiple people will give a mount as well
[0:45:14] Lheela: stormwind -> hyjal
[0:45:41] azrazil720: I made my storm griffin purple too! gorgeous 😁
[0:45:59] IAmScarlett__: hii hazel
[0:46:01] Ryok: @jgbrit but for a lot of people vtubing allows them to stream in the first place, would you watch someone without cam? or cam streamers only
[0:46:03] The_FinnMint: Hi Hazel!
[0:46:19] Ujai321: it's usually a rotation of Animal Crossing, Stardew and HS BG
[0:46:37] amaya21: where is the puppy?
[0:46:45] Ujai321: this mount is great
[0:46:54] Elrathir: you could always use the magic spell "Summon Chat" for the ones that need multiple people hazelShiny
[0:46:54] Ujai321: so luxurious
[0:46:55] IAmScarlett__: how be you today hazel
[0:46:58] jgbrit: I love the cradle apart from you can't see your character
[0:47:01] wolfcloudchaser80: There's always the chance that there are people in your chat that would also want that mount, giving a solution to everyone!
[0:47:23] Ujai321: i mean, you could make Queen Hazel happen
[0:47:35] IAmScarlett__: what are we actually doing today
[0:47:56] TomCat: all hail Queen Hazel
[0:48:12] The_FinnMint: Solo shuffle makes me so scared, maybe im not playing Rdruid properly >.>
[0:48:18] Elrathir: I have a char called "Mechagon", I use the Talon King title on that one
[0:48:31] Ujai321: great, being a modern day monarch is exactly the right thing for you then
[0:48:56] wolfcloudchaser80: in the 19th century, someone in San Francisco declared himself Norton I, Emperor of the United States.
[0:49:09] MackPlays: Go away stream sniper
[0:49:14] brazkat: any1 have good weapon suggestions for a paladin wearing T3 warrior (dreadnaught)
[0:49:20] Gurottesquex: Its a recolor of the Sapphire Skyblazer from the store!
[0:49:28] ghostie1995: gnomelia gearhart mounts a little plane it soo adorable 🥰
[0:49:29] Lheela: when did they add mounts to pets? i always enjoyed them trying to keep up with 310% flying mounts on foot
[0:49:42] CamyK22: well.... you are working towards the 400 honor level pet. The glorious bucketshell. Slowly but surely
[0:50:03] brazkat: also 500 honor level is the last mount
[0:50:08] Ujai321: if you have that mount, you should see who is bigger on it, you or the battle pet
[0:50:10] eielwind: 400 honor level, sheeeeesh
[0:50:39] IAmScarlett__: i am declaring my int to go back to ffxiv
[0:50:44] eielwind: how was it cheesable in legion?
[0:50:45] sence_00: Caverns of Time port?
[0:50:49] Elrathir: I think I've heard of Norton the 1st, I think he became a local celebrity of the time and people would humor his eccentricity
[0:51:05] MackPlays: Legion was a while ago
[0:51:06] TomCat: what happens when The Unstoppable Force meets The Immovable Object?
[0:51:07] eielwind: ooo
[0:51:15] Lheela: can confirm, am honor level 177 without much pvp at all
[0:51:21] Ujai321: so why didnt you do it?
[0:51:29] jgbrit: Drakks be up in your personal space
[0:51:34] Valckorion: !followage
[0:51:52] Ujai321: a fine guess
[0:51:55] Lheela: those legion pvp world quests gave insane amounts of marks of honor
[0:52:01] Ujai321: she is a real mystery
[0:52:08] TiPera: hi, where is this mount from?
[0:52:09] Elrathir: "probably... I don't know" ain't that a mood
[0:52:34] Ujai321: yeah, you have done a guide for it
[0:52:36] TiPera: its different, thank you
[0:52:39] themaykr_: new pc with rtx 4080 arrives in a few weeks, cant wait to play wow at 20 fps in valdrakken
[0:52:42] Ujai321: loot some things, bish bash bosh
[0:52:43] eielwind: FF14 has a bed mount and it makes me laugh all the time
[0:52:53] likertwo: I like the flying chair, good mount
[0:52:57] ratbox_: Hazel you were right!! started snowing yesterday!!
[0:53:00] Gurottesquex: It is a super cute mount concept
[0:53:03] FrilleJr: i want to see that mount with dragonriding
[0:53:14] TiPera: well wow depends more on CPU so :D @themaykr_
[0:53:16] Lee57King: I miss your pet battle videos you used to make, you were the best to watch
[0:53:34] Lheela: i just upgraded from my 970 last year
[0:53:37] Ujai321: dream you didnt do a good job explaining that whole thing
[0:53:46] Lheela: still did well to play wow on 1440p
[0:53:50] Ujai321: and not one xbox
[0:53:51] themaykr_: @tipera yeah you’re right, I think 7800X3d would do the job 😀
[0:53:58] Ryok: i had a dream last night about being in school... knowing i have done my homework BUT doing it again before class... and then in class i couldn't find it but found random artworks of very high level... i can't even draw a stick figure and i haven't been in school for like 13 years xD
[0:54:04] eielwind: do most streamers use 2 PCs?
[0:54:16] TiPera: for sure it will! best gaming CPU! @themaykr_ I hope I can make a new build soon since my GPU died!
[0:54:51] Ujai321: it's annoying, it's warm, power costs money
[0:54:58] wolfcloudchaser80: I haven't owned a console since the SNES. Though Saga was making a good argument for a Switch.
[0:55:08] cashthb: running two high end pcs is a lot of money
[0:55:21] ratbox_: @hazelnuttygames the snowfall yesterday was so pretty, my first time ever seeing it in person
[0:55:28] Ujai321: @wolfcloudchaser80 can i interest you in a Steam Deck
[0:55:30] IAmScarlett__: i play league and league only
[0:55:37] little_c2222: Nothing seems wrong with your stream. You don't need another.
[0:55:39] IAmScarlett__: i can run that game on a potato
[0:55:47] alalonso89: do you play with max graphics in wow?
[0:55:55] eielwind: Switch is an A+ console, highly recommend
[0:56:01] themaykr_: I think you’d love steam deck tbh
[0:56:03] little_c2222: WutFace
[0:56:08] amaya21: do you connect your switch to your tv?
[0:56:19] TomCat: don't even need latest gen to single PC stream intense games anymore
[0:56:20] janahita: Kvms are not that reliable
[0:56:24] cashthb: 1
[0:56:32] Lheela: 3
[0:56:32] Ujai321: i'm genuinely thinking about getting one. all my PC games, plus emulation of most things including Switch, plus portable form factor, PLUS just an actual factual PC with low power consumption
[0:56:33] eielwind: i think my RL has 4 monitors lol
[0:56:35] zantos2020: I need all of the monitors
[0:56:35] thunderwings_wow: I recently went up to 3 but now I want MORE
[0:56:38] cynnahxx: Good morning. I just wanted to pop in to say thank you so much for your raid guides! They are always my go-to 💗
[0:56:40] themaykr_: @tipera I think the v cache would help a lot
[0:56:44] Ryok: @eielwind i follow like... 80 or so active streamer and only 1 of them still runs 2 pcs... because he plays every new AAA game and i only know he still does it because his toddler daughter sometimes randomly turns off the gaming one xD
[0:57:03] wolfcloudchaser80: @Ujai321 Most of my favorite steam games are strategy/survival/building type things that don't lend themselves to handheld, really.
[0:57:06] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have a great day.
[0:57:10] alalonso89: wheel of fortune Kappa
[0:57:27] TiPera: yup! Maybe now u can walk in Valdrakken Kappa @themaykr_
[0:57:43] themaykr_: can’t wait Pog
[0:58:05] Ryok: i probably haven't turned on my tv in over a year... but on february 29th at the LATEST i have to connect it again because then final fantasy 7 rebirth comes out and i HAVE to play it as soon as i get my hands on it
[0:58:08] Ujai321: @wolfcloudchaser80 might be, i havent tried. but if any console could do it, i bet it's the Deck with their track pads
[0:58:19] traktordestrucktor: If  I as an European should visit either Usa or canada  which would you recomend?
[0:58:22] Jeansen: hellow! what are we doing today
[0:58:27] neurotic_pets: is that a mount macro?
[0:58:35] amaya21: do you have fabious?
[0:59:10] TiPera: Do you have a favorite mount?
[0:59:21] necrowoof: litemount, an awesome mount addon
[0:59:24] wolfcloudchaser80: @Ujai321 I didn't know a Steam Deck could emulate a Switch.... interesting
[0:59:29] eielwind: lucid nightmare is top 3 for me
[0:59:30] Lee57King: I have all my mounts set at favolrites
[0:59:41] TiPera: quick! Breath monkaS
[0:59:45] alalonso89: this underwater cave is giving me major anxiety.
[0:59:50] cashthb: the talon lord is my favourite, so it must be your favourite too or you're wrong
[0:59:52] azrazil720: which is the same as none 😂
[0:59:57] Aleigha48: I just completed my monk legion campaign the other day and got the class mount and pet. they are so cute!
[0:59:58] Tmicrochip: Blizz needs to make the Favorite Mounts option Character specific and not account wide.
[1:00:12] cashthb: just get the kalu'ak fishin pole real quick
[1:00:14] TomCat: no artifact fishing pole?
[1:00:16] endless_pastrami: I got my flawless golden baublboi a few days ago and now I feel like all of my pets are invalidated because I want to use him on all my toons
[1:00:20] Ujai321: this is the type of nerve wracking gameplay we come here for
[1:00:25] cashthb: hs
[1:00:51] TiPera: saved Pog
[1:00:57] Airt1: i only realised the other day you dont carry it around anymore, the underlight angler slots into profession gear
[1:00:57] Jeansen: what are you doing in game today
[1:01:04] Ujai321: "twitch chat probably saved streamers in game life. more at 11"
[1:01:19] Lee57King: what are you going after?
[1:01:33] Lee57King: oh, I need that also
[1:01:35] Jeansen: ah okok yea nice 🥰😂
[1:01:43] ghostie1995: @ujai321 lool
[1:01:57] TomCat: I don't know - not drowning is pretty resourceful :)
[1:02:08] Ujai321: look at these ground textures
[1:02:45] Ujai321: i spent many an hour killing grubs here
[1:03:12] Ujai321: i did it for ... acid, i think? it was 2004
[1:03:26] Ujai321: it was just a regular crafting reagent
[1:03:33] eielwind: larval acid i think lol
[1:04:00] eielwind: they did 1 satchel per day so i think its probably the order they came out
[1:04:06] Lee57King: how do I find the quest to start it and where the sachels are?
[1:04:29] Elrathir: 15 gold you get to keep!!
[1:04:34] Nautilus_Blue: big stonks!
[1:04:45] HazelNuttyGames: https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=18644/community-rumor-mill#comments
[1:04:51] Lee57King: thanks
[1:04:51] Ujai321: now it really depends if you want to keep the satchels closed, or plop all that garbage into your inventory
[1:05:18] Aleigha48: thank you for the link
[1:05:20] TiPera: u get this pet on the screenshot?
[1:05:22] TiPera: thats really cute
[1:05:29] Tanarayn: they have mats on Amazon that is basically a heating pad for your feet. if your feet get cold a lot like mine you should definitely think about getting one!
[1:05:31] Hippwn: I use an addon called new openables that I appreciate because it is an easy button for things in my bag I can open
[1:05:41] Ujai321: well, you did delete mushroom grandpa's only friend
[1:05:47] Ujai321: so you have priors
[1:05:56] eielwind: the elder mail is the worst
[1:06:34] Ujai321: oh, you mean the heating pad for the cat
[1:06:54] seamuscg: she deserves it
[1:07:01] TiPera: whats the name of the addon that shows the teleports available?
[1:07:06] little_c2222: That happens to all my blankets and sometimes my clothes
[1:09:04] headlocks000: @TiPera "Tome of Teleportation"
[1:11:01] TiPera: @TiPera thank you
[1:11:46] eielwind: what exactly is the gilneas thing coming with 10.2.5?
[1:13:37] little_c2222: Does your wig keep your head warm?
[1:13:53] ferretclaws: make a crock pot with tea and get yourself a ladle and youre all set :D
[1:14:10] Marmoh: I love season of discovery :p
[1:14:51] voidmuse: Tobias is freaking adorable
[1:14:51] eielwind: 3 in northrend
[1:15:22] eielwind: you probably have freehold on evoker
[1:16:11] wolfcloudchaser80: For the satchel in Grizzly Hills, you have to ride a log flume thing down to the satchel before it's lootable.
[1:16:47] wolfcloudchaser80: That was the only one that really gave me trouble in this whole satchel thing. The rest were straightforward.
[1:18:23] eielwind: tomorrow is squirt day...how much worse is it than super squirt, still worth doing?
[1:18:28] Saigha: oooooo, what addon do you use for your pet screen?
[1:18:54] jeffdmk: super squirt is not even worth doing the dalaran trainers are faster
[1:19:07] Lee57King: all my pets are level 25 now I also have 1607 unique pets
[1:19:10] jeffdmk: at least the fast ones are
[1:19:10] Saigha: Love it!  Thank you so much
[1:19:25] eielwind: im still a beginner with pets but most of mine arent leveled, trying to think quickest way
[1:19:37] Lee57King: I started because of you
[1:19:58] amaya21: will you do an updated addon video this year?
[1:20:12] Midget04: speaking of pets. Hows ur puppy doing? :)
[1:20:15] HazelNuttyGames: !addons
[1:20:16] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[1:20:45] little_c2222: Teen  boy
[1:20:48] goplacidly56: Where is Kira today?
[1:20:49] jgbrit: That's where I'm at, I've just started. I'm about 70 in but I refuse to catch anything less than rare which is why I asked about flawless battle stones
[1:20:54] cashthb: you don't need hundreds and hundreds tho, I use the same 6 for 90% of the battles, after those you can just slowly progress on celestial tournament teams or something
[1:21:29] amaya21: how old is the puppy?
[1:22:02] eielwind: is there another method thats good for leveling fast if its not super squirt? i know it'll be tedious regardless, but gotta start sometime
[1:22:13] random_redshirt: hazelShiny hazelShiny hazelShiny
[1:22:15] goplacidly56: There she is!
[1:22:33] jeffdmk: there are 2 that are slightly faster
[1:22:36] SloshyFungGuy: what are you doing rn ??
[1:22:44] LKatey75: Kitty!
[1:23:04] LKatey75: I think I might be ready to adopt a new kitty, might go look this weekend
[1:23:17] little_c2222: Anytime I repair one of my dog's toys that seam is the strongest part of it. It doesn't come apart like factory seams. however, they will find another spot eventually to rip open. L o l
[1:23:31] amaya21: Kira is so cute!! <3
[1:23:42] sibimi: such adorable kitty!
[1:23:48] kaur_q: cute cat
[1:23:54] jgbrit: Just ordered Pizza Hut. I haven't had takeaway in months because I'm so cheap
[1:24:36] goplacidly56: My dog's mission for toys is getting the squeeker out. I've taught her to drop it and not chew it when she gets it out lol
[1:24:43] little_c2222: Yeah sometimes mine do that especially to appendages.
[1:24:56] cashthb: also, while I still needed the shiny charms I did the garrison thingies everyday, when Eris is up it's like 5-6 stone for barely anything if you still check your garrison table for archeology fragments or something
[1:25:08] little_c2222: Yes the dolls will have no arms legs or ears l o l
[1:25:22] dvkJoe: Hi, everyone.
[1:25:40] russtrotter: my dog is a card-carrying member of the Squeeker Removal Special Forces
[1:25:52] goplacidly56: lol
[1:25:58] dvkJoe: I'm fine.
[1:26:29] sence_00: i think there is a Horde v Alliance start point
[1:26:34] Calaxandra: Seems like there was one side for horde and the other side for alliance
[1:26:39] sence_00: and that was the Horde one ya
[1:27:03] goplacidly56: I cant believe I've never seen this
[1:27:09] sence_00: looked like maybe the middle one had someone
[1:27:11] sibimi: I think there was one earlier?
[1:27:12] sibimi: to the right
[1:27:16] sibimi: yeah, middle one
[1:27:31] cashthb: why would it be at the bottom of it tho
[1:28:03] Ama_ryilis: Kira is so beautiful
[1:28:25] Kuestar: such a pretty kitty
[1:28:26] nyrhalahotep: KITTYYYYYYYYYYYY
[1:28:45] goplacidly56: It is the best
[1:28:49] Elrathir: I wish owlbears were real
[1:29:00] Promilie: Your cat is so fucking cute I'm gonna die
[1:29:04] goplacidly56: yes!
[1:29:14] LKatey75: cats aren't really domesticated
[1:29:20] josdael: I kinda want a 3 meter tall cat :(
[1:29:30] Arabany: Will this event stay in the game forever?
[1:29:46] LKatey75: that's a big litter box
[1:29:50] helheimr: @LKatey75 yep, its we that they domesticated
[1:30:19] Arabany: We can still do Rumble and treasure hunting, can't we?
[1:30:39] aliceimpala: How old is the kitty
[1:30:39] sence_00: thats a real phenomenon! Apparently going through threshholds does something to our brains
[1:30:49] LKatey75: I can't remember why I pick up my phone 80% of the time :D :D
[1:30:50] sence_00: or so said the Discovery Channel in the early 2000s
[1:30:50] Lee57King: my friend and I are starting the treasure hunt now
[1:31:00] Elrathir: *enters stormwind portal room from valdrakken* where was I going? uuuh probably valdrakken
[1:31:12] VinnyTB: Game needs a sat nav. I put in where I want to go and it sets a course for me
[1:31:29] dvkJoe: There's a reason ancient egyptians saw cats as gods.
[1:32:12] nyrhalahotep: I sometimes forget how beautiful these  are
[1:32:19] russtrotter: that mount looks like a rattan chair that countless college roomates had.. the slacker's mount
[1:32:29] nyrhalahotep: the Maps in this expansion
[1:32:54] dvkJoe: Oh Like Illidan, who became blind but got the ability to see all kinds of magic.
[1:33:18] sence_00: in the water iirc
[1:33:44] sence_00: sorry the fountain mouth
[1:34:06] k3lz0: Hi, what are we searching?
[1:34:13] sence_00: maybe, its been a minute
[1:34:13] Tanarayn: is Kira purring or is that in the game? 😂
[1:34:24] k3lz0: AH, the mounds
[1:34:37] jgbrit: As if anyone would find that without wowhead
[1:34:43] Hulkhokie: that pet is amazing
[1:34:49] Elrathir: tobias, gift from the wild gods of pandaria
[1:34:49] Hulkhokie: with the little sherlock holmes hat
[1:34:57] eielwind: the secret finder discord is insane with this stuff
[1:35:03] dvkJoe: Sherdog Holmes
[1:35:08] seamuscg: mount
[1:35:29] robinhejlol: My cat would never sit beside me like that, it only walks by with its butt, farts to show its time for food. Its weird like that
[1:35:35] seamuscg: oh then i guess nothing else
[1:35:38] seamuscg: oopsie
[1:35:39] CamyK22: Theres a mount for cerain ones I believe
[1:35:53] wolfcloudchaser80: If you collect every single satchel you get.... satisfaction! (and nothing else)
[1:36:02] CamyK22: You need multiple people for the mount
[1:36:04] cashthb: epic bg? :O
[1:36:07] Kiwaia: hellu kitty!!!
[1:36:13] eielwind: each satchel is 250g  /shrug
[1:36:26] amaya21: long boy!!
[1:36:31] amaya21: so jealous
[1:37:26] sence_00: do you have the Devoured Wader from Bastion? I feel like the rares are never up
[1:38:24] cashthb: I don't remember details, but I remember being pretty annoyed by that quest line
[1:38:32] sence_00: Im losing my mind with that one
[1:38:39] Lee57King: can you link this questline also?
[1:38:41] sence_00: the gurgl one is just the Blackrock thing?
[1:39:02] HazelNuttyGames: https://www.wowhead.com/quest=64237/gurgl-and-the-bandit#comments
[1:39:12] Lee57King: many thanks
[1:39:37] tiimek: did you finish all the s3 stuff already?
[1:40:17] tiimek: so CE? xd
[1:41:39] tiimek: fair, I hope this season is something they will build on in the future, by far the best in the last few xpacs imo
[1:42:16] ghostie1995: anybody here in the squirrel squad guild ? idk if they’re still recruiting
[1:42:25] Zuldak: there can be some visual clutter issues, like with ground effects still
[1:42:33] cashthb: I'd argue wether they are challenging or not
[1:42:53] Tanarayn: have you played season of discovery at all? I know you seemed to have fun in HC
[1:42:57] Zuldak: Also TSwift doing the fireball thing when you first get to him is rude
[1:43:19] Zuldak: you can argue with chat endlessly now
[1:43:26] jeffdmk: and yet you never argue with us which is sad
[1:43:34] eielwind: how could you forget Birch
[1:44:01] Arabany: Challenging and wow are kind of mutually exclusive terms:)
[1:44:18] Zuldak: @jeffdmk she doesnt argue, she just makes a point to do the opposite of any suggestion :P
[1:44:31] sence_00: lol idk about that, Ive seen Naguura call her viewers idiots and they love her
[1:44:38] sence_00: you be as mean as you want
[1:44:57] jgbrit: I think you strike a perfect balance. Streamers need boundaries
[1:45:30] voidmuse: have you *watched* taliesin? his arguing is his baseline!
[1:45:44] voidmuse: i mean that in a good way
[1:45:46] zravendh: @HazelNuttyGames Is your enjoyment of the game leveling up and farming collectibles? Not interested in M+?
[1:45:54] conksalot: Can you make an indian style sourdough flatbread? Or is that a naan-starter?
[1:46:10] russtrotter: it's a sh*t show... obviously
[1:46:13] zravendh: Oh, sorry!
[1:46:15] zravendh: kkkkk
[1:46:22] Zuldak: the T&E stream experience is... a thing
[1:46:28] Zuldak: i like their videos a lot
[1:46:44] tiimek: any predictions on the final season dungeons?
[1:46:50] Zuldak: @conksalot boooo
[1:46:52] Zuldak: <3
[1:46:55] voidmuse: the groannis real
[1:47:04] tiimek: ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[1:47:47] helheimr: yay! finally got a Jade Defender pet from the vale nzoth assault
[1:47:49] zravendh: Do you like the fact that Blizzard is starting to listen to the community more? I thought it was a big improvement
[1:47:52] jgbrit: I might be the only person but I LOVED Life Pools
[1:48:16] Zuldak: so no raid shadow legends sellout saga?
[1:48:29] voidmuse: i like your stream because you are chill, the crowd is chill, and I always learn something new
[1:48:31] Asreyya: they fixed the skip in azure vaults too
[1:48:36] ghostie1995: I’d like to stream someday but I don’t think I’d be interesting lol
[1:48:45] cashthb: I'd very much argue the opposite
[1:49:17] Zuldak: the community voted for Grimrail... dont trust them to make decisions
[1:49:26] jgbrit: I haven't been listened to, I want my visage form after hover and I want my visage form on the loading screen LUL
[1:49:48] Neltalie: lmaoooo
[1:49:49] Asreyya: haha
[1:49:53] kpatt17: The boss would need to be a gnome
[1:49:56] Zuldak: renaming Ashvane in EP to Hazel
[1:50:04] goosepun: LUL
[1:50:06] russtrotter: hazel nutty playdoh fun factory boss!
[1:50:06] HolocronCoder: Removing pets from the game entirely might do it
[1:50:09] jakey_snakey: Lolol that....would be amazing nvm
[1:50:09] voidmuse: oddly specific haha
[1:50:10] Elrathir: what if they deleted gnomes?
[1:50:11] vampire_enthusiast: What if they removed gnomes?
[1:50:11] jeffdmk: There is also the cycle of people begging to make the most challenging thing easier and given to everyone which is really unstainable
[1:50:13] sence_00: I fully expect they will add a Hazel pet in if they havent already
[1:50:21] cashthb: what if they would *make you have to use glacial spike for a seconds season*
[1:50:27] Tanarayn: your mind is fascinating 😂
[1:51:03] des_olation: i just got infinite timereaver, your stream is always good luck for me when im watching
[1:51:10] wolfcloudchaser80: If they wanted to make Hazel quit, they'd just introduce a rule that all ranged is gone, DPS and heals must be done in melee range.
[1:51:12] dvkJoe: south on that island?
[1:51:52] sence_00: man I have this pet and remember none of this
[1:52:41] Zuldak: tanks can just self heal
[1:52:54] Elrathir: are we just brainstorming ways of making hazel quit? :o
[1:53:00] Asreyya: I already do, but I play a blood dk lol
[1:53:03] jgbrit: Would you say Speedy has, Sped off LUL
[1:53:14] jeffdmk: They make you play a mini game where you slaughter cats and dogs everytime you log in
[1:53:26] voidmuse: no more gnomes- you must be at least ---- tall to be a PC
[1:53:30] cashthb: warframe is my goto example of devs listening to the community turning out bad; the game is still okay as a chore simulator, but you have to try *extremely* hard to fail a mission so doing them feels like a waste of time - keep in mind the community still enjoys it some how
[1:55:19] eielwind: the difference in diffculty between heroic and mythic is CRAZY, we are on like pull 105 of M Smolderon and not even close
[1:55:45] voidmuse: or gnomes and goblin only servers: World of Smallscraft
[1:56:11] krobus24: That was a good article ..HOF numbers are apparently very low
[1:56:13] cashthb: the difficulty difference between hc and mythic kinda undermines that argument imo
[1:56:18] cooldito: I would pay several extra dollars a month to make gnomes not exist
[1:56:18] jeffdmk: They have remove a large amount of the mythic raid level challenging collecting
[1:56:18] voidmuse: yyyeeeeaaahhhh!!!!
[1:57:35] eielwind: when you were crafting 1000s of phials, what did craftsim say the average profit per craft was?
[1:57:44] cooldito: can't wait for delves and follower dungeons too
[1:58:07] Arabany: Raids in WoW are not bad, but they are focused too much around avoiding stuff and other arcade mechanics rather then actually tactics, group setup, player's interaction and such.
[1:58:23] Arabany: And keys are just pure arcade.
[1:59:48] thunderioum: something that i discovered a couple days ago ! if you are bored of the travel time to the back of the pvp room to upgrade your gear ! there is another npc that is in a small room at the left of the pvp building that also upgrades gear lol :D
[1:59:53] StarryDel: what activities are we getting into today friends?
[2:00:08] cashthb: keys are being pure arcade is bit of a longshot, smart pulling is a big thing on higher keys; also we had pridefull

[2:03:14] sence_00: Razageth is going to live rent free in my head for a LONG time, the "ruuuiiiiiinnn Ruuuiiinnn!!!" is stuck
[2:03:20] sence_00: plux we'll hear more in s4
[2:03:40] ghostie1995: “look, browse! …sniff.”
[2:05:17] Promilie: Raszageth had SUCH good voice acting

[2:06:15] jgbrit: Flyn shouting 'Somthing just touched my leg, oh wait, its my other leg" is such a good one
[2:06:18] eielwind: ohhhhh

[2:07:48] Zuldak: im excited for the outland cup next week
[2:07:56] Zuldak: think dracthyr will be able to dragonride race with no mount?
[2:08:42] Zuldak: hmm... maybe not because they cant 'ride' while on the ground
[2:08:48] Promilie: @Zuldak I tried on the PTR but it wouldn't let me. Just cancelled the race when I used Soar
[2:08:50] BigTroubleLittleWarcraft: ive been playing wow for along time but never did battle pets... what addon should i have and how hard is this going to be... need something to keep me busy now

[2:17:28] cashthb: make a "deleting ONE BILLION dragon pet charms" video
[2:17:40] Zuldak: no...will see the next rotation in 8 min
[2:18:33] Zuldak: ya know something you put off? Cobalt Assembly
[2:18:34] jgbrit: Are all these pet charms the ones from shadowlands mission tables?
[2:18:54] jakefx1: this is my kinda gambling!
[2:19:48] Asreyya: they need to make an open all option
[2:21:27] Ujai321: Did you do your world tour?
[2:22:23] fisherreads: I remember you using gloopy in the pet battle tournament!
[2:22:45] leeetlemouse: hey hey hazel! hope youre staying warm in the bc cold snap  <3
[2:23:04] Zuldak: Sack nippler... heh
[2:23:10] Zuldak: i am 3 years old
[2:23:16] Ujai321: Your world tour of digging up piles of dirt
[2:23:38] jgbrit: I got Mitzy to 25 by battling yesterday
[2:23:48] leeetlemouse: yup, im in fraser valley. walked home from uni in a crisp -17C
[2:24:40] LKatey75: our kids up here go outside to play in school until -10 F
[2:24:41] Zuldak: at some point the temp is just 'cold' and it doesnt matter how much colder it gets
[2:25:06] LKatey75: @Zuldak -5 f
[2:25:26] leeetlemouse: @LKatey75 its about that in my hometown rn, -26C, -15F
[2:26:04] leeetlemouse: the cold is just kinda the worst. cant even ski in this weater
[2:26:06] sence_00: idk Calgary is -49C with windchill today and that hurts to breathe
[2:26:08] leeetlemouse: weather**
[2:26:10] Wandering_Bluenoser: Warmed up today here, only -35c now.
[2:26:18] LKatey75: @LKatey75 we haven't really hit the negatives too much yet this year, we usually do in February
[2:26:23] wolfcloudchaser80: There's some town in Siberia that's so cold that they have to keep their vehicle engines running all winter -- they literally won't start again in such cold.
[2:27:18] LKatey75: they leave the diesels running when they go to the store here
[2:27:24] cashthb: it's a realyl goog one, it can pretty much solo one of the celestial tuornament trainers
[2:27:27] Zuldak: still no magpies Sadge
[2:28:01] Zuldak: I want to recoup the 1.4M i spent
[2:28:23] Ujai321: Did you implement the sub goal for the wig btw? I remember you said something about it yesterday
[2:28:29] Elrathir: @Zuldak that's a lotta gold to spend!!
[2:28:41] leeetlemouse: upgrades people, upgrades!
[2:29:03] Zuldak: @Elrathir 1.2M on a gold beetle and 180K on a Fyrrak heroic kill
[2:29:09] LKatey75: coldest I've felt was -38 f, I was like nope and went right back inside
[2:29:10] Ujai321: What is twitch, if not frivolous
[2:29:30] jgbrit: Does the shadowlands tables still give pet charms in the same amounts? I know the gold was nerfed
[2:29:47] BLARGO_: Do you have any tips for getting started with Battle Pets? I have like 300 from across the years and a few 25s but collecting everything and leveling seems so daunting.
[2:29:53] Ujai321: Man, TLDR missions
[2:29:56] HazelNuttyGames: !xufu
[2:29:56] Streamlabs: Find lists of most-used pets, import teams, look up strategies and more on https://www.wow-petguide.com/
[2:30:04] Elrathir: @Zuldak well, that beetle IS very awesome! :D
[2:30:10] Ujai321: Remember how we had to push you to that
[2:30:13] maypelsyrup: heart or hearth *ba dum tss*
[2:30:16] jeffdmk: @LKatey75 at that temp, the scales are close enough mentioning c or f does not matter much
[2:31:01] CamyK22: You have inspired me to make a gnome alt. She is a gnome Mage named Blinksy
[2:31:31] Promilie: I keep changing my evoker's appearance, it's so hard to choose!
[2:31:38] seamuscg: im leveling a gnome mage named Hydronzo
[2:31:56] Ujai321: Isn't that most of your alts
[2:32:53] Ujai321: It's a great city
[2:33:12] Zuldak: i want to know the lore behind gold in wow. Like... the same currency is used across planets, dimensions, timelines and plains of existence
[2:33:22] Elrathir: Just hit 70 on my orc warrior! 2 new 70s in one day! robx3DuckPog
[2:34:29] Ujai321: I bet nobbel can help you, @zuldak
[2:34:48] Sunabubus: wasn't there a change where you can use the stone in the journal?
[2:34:49] Aseopp: Love buttercup
[2:35:06] Sunabubus: I'm using the rematch queue and I can use the stones in the queue
[2:35:09] Ujai321: I wonder how throwing stones at pets makes them stronger
[2:35:13] little_c2222: Yes it was
[2:35:20] Aseopp: I leveled my buttercup immediately
[2:35:32] ophypanda: How do you chose which pet to keep when you have duplicates? I get confused with the variations (s,s or p,p) etc?
[2:36:04] Ujai321: If you ever need more pet charms, that is. Sounds like a much later you problem
[2:36:09] Sunabubus: there's also a new strategy for Squirt in the garrison. It's superfast, 45 sec per match
[2:36:14] jeffdmk: if you revive characters i win too so keep that in mind
[2:36:42] jakeisacat: yeah, I’m really considering farming pet charms again.  I’ve spent all morning leveling all my snail pets for briggul down in zaralek caverns LUL
[2:36:57] bear__b34r: I've never in my entire life seen so many pet charms... I am blown away. I salute you and your bloodline
[2:37:11] Zuldak: you would need to also farm anima to get the command tables set up...
[2:37:26] Elrathir: what a terrible fate for an alt
[2:37:31] cashthb: or just be a mage and have your hs in your covenant hall
[2:37:49] ophypanda: how adorable is she?!?!?! I didn't see her sweet little crown!
[2:37:56] bear__b34r: @Elrathir true. It's like that silly meme where the robot is all "What's my purpose?" "to sit at the shadowlands command table" "oh my god"
[2:38:05] Sunabubus: I settled with Squirt. Setting up alts + checking them every day 8loading screen) nah :D
[2:38:15] Elrathir: @bear__b34r exactly!!
[2:38:24] ophypanda: I need roland! Where did you get him?
[2:38:38] MagicPants1414: hey Hazel! nice hair! !
[2:38:42] Greevers: lovely Boralus music xx
[2:38:49] CamyK22: You get a huge amount by doing the 4 swaps of covenants and using the renown boost on all them. Gets you a sold 5k anima
[2:39:06] Varezhka8: in Zaralek I'm pretty sure
[2:39:08] sence_00: from Forbidden Reach
[2:39:11] ophypanda: Ratatouille!
[2:39:15] Wandering_Bluenoser: Ducks in a row is the achievcement
[2:39:15] sence_00: Zkera Vault
[2:39:17] Hulkhokie: i'm just now getting around to farmin gall of the protoform synthesis pets :/
[2:39:25] HazelNuttyGames: https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=17736/the-gift-of-cheese
[2:39:28] Ujai321: aCHEESEment
[2:39:41] wolfcloudchaser80: Cheeeese, Gromit!
[2:39:48] FloorpTv: where did you get your wig?
[2:39:52] Aseopp: I gave a friend a wheel of cheese for christmas last year. She was not impressed
[2:40:00] Ujai321: It gets even better with your vague ny/Boston accent
[2:40:09] Aseopp: right?
[2:40:12] Aseopp: Oh...
[2:40:16] jeffdmk: it is a cheesy gift honestly
[2:40:17] Zuldak: i mean a wheel is like 40 lbs of cheese
[2:40:36] janahita: A wheel of cheese is so expensive I'd love that lol
[2:40:37] Hulkhokie: how many unique pets do you have?
[2:40:40] jgbrit: You could say she was cheesed off LUL
[2:40:40] Zuldak: would a wheel fit in a freezer?
[2:40:45] seamuscg: it is
[2:40:48] Aseopp: Yea, its was a smaller wheel... like 15 lbs
[2:40:50] HolocronCoder: I will take a gift of cheese (unless it's really bad cheese, like.. american. Or weak cheddar).
[2:40:54] marbared: freeze the cheese please
[2:41:00] Zuldak: oh just 15 lbs of cheese...
[2:41:20] Ujai321: Your freezer doesn't have space for a wheel of cheese, for example. It's full of fish and cake already
[2:41:27] Revalya: @HazelNuttyGames  did you know that you can use the pet-stones directly on the pets wihtout summen them
[2:41:31] Aseopp: Yea, i thought it was a nice gift :)
[2:41:39] Zuldak: @Ujai321 if you combine the fish and cake, you have fish cakes and save room
[2:41:57] KaryauGaming: KaryauGaming subscribed with Prime. 
[2:41:57] Streamlabs: karyaugaming just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:41:59] Ujai321: That is how it works, that is true
[2:42:06] KaryauGaming: love your youtube content
[2:42:41] Ujai321: Speaking of YouTube!
[2:42:49] Ujai321: Fyrakk?
[2:43:03] Zuldak: checking in on the season 4 votes... so far the look and season bonus i wanted are winning
[2:43:07] Ujai321: Relatable
[2:44:03] Ujai321: I would believe the amount of shed from a 100 pound dog
[2:44:25] janahita: hazelTen
[2:44:26] Varezhka8: PogChamp
[2:44:31] slighthouse: I call them tumblefurs, I have 2 maine coons that fill the house with hair
[2:44:38] KaryauGaming: are you excited for the 16th
[2:44:56] cashthb: I was not paying attention, is your honor level 400 pet 25 alredy?
[2:45:08] Ujai321: We haven't gotten a new pet in a while
[2:45:11] wolfcloudchaser80: Does anyone have a specific local term for "dust bunnies?" I once read there's tons of terms for that phenomenon.
[2:45:14] Varezhka8: I really hope we actually get Gilneas and not just a scenario..
[2:45:46] cashthb: @wolfcloudchaser80 they are dust kitties in hungarian
[2:46:15] tehl00py: dust kitties :') now i won't sweep
[2:46:17] wolfcloudchaser80: The article I read about it is now behind a paywall unfortunately.
[2:46:30] Sylwevrin: @wolfcloudchaser80 Dust rats in Swedish :P
[2:46:34] LKatey75: dust bunny ghost town
[2:46:38] jgbrit: Can we see her mog pls
[2:46:41] LKatey75: that's what I call under the couch
[2:46:48] Ujai321: Wool mice, is a term in German
[2:46:54] tehl00py: @Sylwevrin no i'm sweeping!
[2:47:06] Kyodia: @HazelNuttyGames Was there reason you never released a Fyrakk video guide? BibleThump
[2:47:08] Ujai321: Wow, you finally caved and pushed crypto
[2:47:16] cashthb: night elves get a new a capital... why do the alliance gets 2 capitals and the horde none? the forsaken should reclaim gilneas, it would be so troll
[2:47:27] jgbrit: I love the shoulders
[2:47:29] Sylwevrin: "What happened" - Me logging on any alt
[2:47:40] wolfcloudchaser80: "House Moss" is apparently another super-local term for it in the US
[2:47:47] Aseopp: Very cool xmog
[2:47:47] cashthb: you don't have the anime scarf looking thingy from the last shadow lands season? :O
[2:48:03] ghostie1995: hey but you got most of them out so I call it a win
[2:48:15] Elrathir: I think you sent over account bound PvP gear tokens that you bought with leftover conquest
[2:48:17] Ujai321: Do you still have TLDR installed?
[2:48:30] thatguynamedjans: Oh I didnt know you were streaming! Hi Hazel :D
[2:49:16] thatguynamedjans: But you have your rainbow bubble
[2:49:18] Zuldak: welp the blue roundup was posted so no more news from big Blizz this week
[2:49:38] jeffdmk: The move is make all speed druids which is sad and boring
[2:49:46] bustykrabb: *kindly* "can you please send me to the gates of hell?" made me lol
[2:49:46] jgbrit: Priest is alot faster than paladin even these days
[2:49:51] Ujai321: Can't wait for you to tell me what happened
[2:49:55] Zuldak: i have 9 druids all 450 ilvl + :/
[2:50:03] wolfcloudchaser80: The new bonsai-dragon mount is a good topic for the news video
[2:50:07] thatguynamedjans: "In other news in wow, my guildmate Jans continues to be gloriously hilarious occasionally" :D
[2:50:19] marbared: shammy wolf for farming?
[2:50:24] Zuldak: oh yeah the bonzai dragon was this week
[2:50:33] Aseopp: How does the bonsai dragon fly? I have not see it yet
[2:50:38] Zuldak: so whats gonna be the chinese new year drake mount
[2:50:55] Sylwevrin: @Aseopp It's a dragonriding mount with the base-line skills :)
[2:50:58] wolfcloudchaser80: Yup, exactly
[2:51:01] cashthb: @Aseopp same as the zaralek caverns noodle
[2:51:02] Ujai321: The year of the leafy dragon
[2:51:05] BerryPinkCow: @Aseopp it's a dragon riding, flies like the siltherdrake
[2:51:06] Sylwevrin: Yeah, bonzai is the lunar new year mount
[2:51:22] Sunabubus: took me so much time to figure out this raid layout to not get lost. Also when I see a closed door I don't evne try to open it, it caused some prblems in here :D
[2:51:23] Zuldak: its a reskinned slither drake
[2:51:25] Aseopp: And i need a 6 month to get it?
[2:51:25] wolfcloudchaser80: I haven't checked if there's any customizations for it, though
[2:51:56] DaTeacher_x: how are you lfr in an old expansion?
[2:51:57] Sylwevrin: Did anyone else find the ability on the war within gryphon very underwhelming? Just feels clunky and unfun to use :(
[2:51:57] Zuldak: no customizations
[2:52:15] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh, and there's a pet too, but it is interestingly for classic-era only.
[2:52:29] Zuldak: beware some LFRs in BFA are no doable solo. Looking at you wing 3 of uldir
[2:52:33] thatguynamedjans: I got that mount from LFR in Legion when it was current :D
[2:52:57] Zuldak: i had to hard grind this mount in BFA
[2:53:03] thatguynamedjans: any time we have a mount off now I know what to do lol
[2:53:12] jgbrit: I almost bought a 12 month sub today and even though its the best value and it'll save me money in the long run, spending that much in one go makes my eyeballs bleed
[2:53:28] seamuscg: think i might adopt a cat today :)
[2:53:50] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm pretty sure the 6-month sub is equal value for money, isn't it?
[2:53:58] Ujai321: Exciting!
[2:53:59] tehl00py: i accidentally took a break when bg3 came out. my 6 month sub side eyed me
[2:54:27] cashthb: -26 gold
[2:54:33] jgbrit: I wouldn't be taking a break but I don't spend many hours in the week playing because work and life
[2:54:37] Sylwevrin: I just pretend the game doesn't  cost me money per month <.<
[2:54:40] Aseopp: @tehl00py I am really thinking about trying BG3
[2:54:47] Sunabubus: game be like "yo uare gonna place this here anyway!"
[2:54:48] wolfcloudchaser80: That's two people in chat talking about adopting kitties!
[2:54:50] thatguynamedjans: Back to work, have a great rest of your stream Hazel! :)
[2:54:51] marbared: Hazel - singlehandedly inspiring the world to clear the cat shelters.
[2:54:57] cashthb: no idea, 26 is what I remember, I'm in eu tho
[2:55:13] spillek2505: The monthly cost is the only thing thats preventing me from starting again
[2:55:27] wolfcloudchaser80: And by the way, anyone who does get a new pet, the Squirrel Squad discord would be a nice place to share photos. Hint hint.
[2:55:28] Ujai321: They sound warm
[2:55:40] LKatey75: I hope to get two kitties this weekend, or soon at least
[2:55:54] Ujai321: I do love long underwear when it's cold
[2:56:02] LKatey75: It's been a few months since my 19 year old kitty passed away and I think I'm ready
[2:56:03] tehl00py: @Aseopp it's so good! very different gameplay than wow, but if you're into dnd or high fantasy & high customization, super fun and great story :3
[2:56:10] merdz12: it's -31 degrees C here today
[2:56:13] Ujai321: !discord
[2:56:13] Streamlabs: Join the Squirrel Squad Discord! https://discord.gg/SKEWdF8H3H
[2:56:14] merdz12: crazy cold
[2:56:30] LKatey75: I'm sorry, I'll try and keep my cold air to myself
[2:56:38] jeffdmk: why is it called a cold snap exactly
[2:56:50] Marmoh: It's been so warm this winter in Toronto, I'm struggling to hate climate change
[2:57:20] azrazil720: yeah, it gets cold in the time it takes to snap your fingers
[2:57:26] Vesamora: someone earlier said they got the Infinite Timereaver and called your stream good luck. I was just on the phone with my parents, clicking a random spell here and there, and got it too. Your stream really is good luck
[2:57:29] azrazil720: like a magic trick!
[2:57:32] wolfcloudchaser80: @LKatey75 Lost my pup this past spring. I feel for you. We want to do some traveling before we take on a new pet, though.
[2:57:45] SepTiaTheNerd: Greetings, everyone! Your local purple Night Elf has arrived! I hope you're all having a wonderful Friday so far.
[2:57:47] LKatey75: Funny though, Anchorage is getting record breaking snow, Juneau hardly has any
[2:57:50] cashthb: what temperature are we talking about? it just resets the cd of ice barrier, ib and frost nova
[2:57:54] jeffdmk: then why dont i have it?
[2:58:05] LKatey75: @wolfcloudchaser80 :(
[2:58:09] JonricWasHere: did you all know that the trash before kil'jaeden wraps up a loose end from vanilla? the trash mobs are the last members of the Shadow Council, the legion-serving orcs acting in the background all the way from vanilla and ragefire chasm
[2:58:12] Ujai321: "hazelnuttygames. The best place to get your infinite time reaver"
[2:58:22] Ujai321: A sub gives +10 luck
[2:58:37] SNAKEBOMBS22: just looted felsteel annihilator!
[2:58:37] LKatey75: Juneau is probably closer to your type of weather than us though
[2:58:49] Sylwevrin: @JonricWasHere Huh, that's really cool!
[2:59:09] cashthb: *darnassus
[2:59:12] wolfcloudchaser80: And you can even get that +10 luck using Amazon Prime for no charge!
[2:59:37] SepTiaTheNerd: Ooh, I enjoy his transmog a lot! :O
[2:59:54] Vesamora: See chat, you have to watch the stream to win the big loots
[2:59:58] Aseopp: @tehl00py I do have a background in dnd, but that was a very long time ago. I am getting drawn in by a buddy who wants to coop it
[3:00:20] Greevers: is Moonkin fun to play
[3:00:22] Lluksobad: I got the mythic Garrosh mount before tusks, all I can dream are tusks
[3:00:23] SepTiaTheNerd: He's like a Moonkin but only half-moonkin.
[3:00:50] Zuldak: Apparently Moonkin are the disc priests of druids
[3:01:24] Zuldak: you put 2 dots on a thing and then you spam wrath and starfire
[3:01:30] SepTiaTheNerd: See, I like Moonkin fairly well, but also I do enjoy flinging Wraths 24/7 as a restoration druid. Feels satisfying.
[3:01:37] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm annoyed with moonkin in the way that you must cast the opposite type of spell you WANT to cast in order to power up the spell you DO want to cast.
[3:01:40] jgbrit: I love the moonkin aesthetic but I can't play it for toffee, I die all the time
[3:01:41] Ujai321: You were struggling a lot
[3:01:43] Zuldak: convoke is friend to moonkin
[3:01:47] Ujai321: Since at least SL
[3:01:56] azrazil720: I kept one of my toons locked to siege of org for a long long time so my brother could try to farm the shoulders from garrosh without going through the whole thing every time, and after like 4 years he finally got them
[3:01:58] Aquanaria97: I love boomy!
[3:02:00] LKatey75: hey that's neat
[3:02:08] lavacaestaenfuego: i quest in resto so i have an excuse for poor 'moonkin' dps
[3:02:18] Zuldak: oh yeah! they are changing the SL covenant abilities vistal animations next week
[3:02:21] LKatey75: I think Victoria is closer to Juneau than we are
[3:02:23] Zuldak: visual*
[3:03:28] sence_00: as a MW main, the new faeline is going to take some getting used to. Its cool but its SO different
[3:03:36] sence_00: but mostly the new animations are great
[3:03:38] cashthb: btw aren't the antlers in the way when Barnaclus' cast his hook? - it's been on my chest for way too long
[3:03:52] Sunabubus: some of the zone drops are very very expensive on the Ah
[3:04:06] Sunabubus: I farmed one out because it was 100k+ and I was like nah
[3:04:07] Zuldak: for a sec i thought you were talking about Moose's ears
[3:04:38] Zuldak: plush*
