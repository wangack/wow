[2:41:48] Atalos1126: Premed and mfd is the way
[2:41:58] Hoodphu: also shadow duel is a really fun ability
[2:42:25] BowRob516: premed and weaponmaster are interchangable but premed is better for AoE and pvp so you dont ever have to spend combo points on slice n dice, while weaponmaster is better for single target due to single target fights typically lasting longer
[2:42:38] lagren_: and if you have the conduit then you get passive healing
[2:42:55] OnlyABanana: pikabooMove pikabooMove pikabooMove
[2:43:02] Hoodphu: Jebaited
[2:44:21] lagren_: it works with shadow dance
[2:44:44] JANGO2: i think he has a command where u can see his talents jake
[2:44:54] BowRob516: no, you need slice and dice prior to the button press
[2:44:55] lagren_: i actually dont know lmfaooo
[2:45:40] BowRob516: in order to use slice n dice you need to spend combo points which is a wasted 4k-8k damage, which in pvp you need all of that extra damage
[2:45:42] Goddommit87: slice and dice helps are energy regen
[2:45:46] Goddommit87: also
[2:45:58] nazu44: i believe so, i dont play wow anymore
