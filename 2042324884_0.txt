[0:59:02] Lorrdzik: zeplaQyay zeplaQyay
[0:59:12] Lento_VI: zeplaQyay
[0:59:16] dimi9231: gg
[0:59:24] MyotisStarcaller: is it more engaging than raids in ff ? kinda looks more dynamic.
[0:59:31] MyotisStarcaller: myotis2Mhm
[0:59:32] dimi9231: went fast
[0:59:52] Tygaeris: I love these wow mods, you must tell me what they are
[1:00:01] tanaith: 'You wanna be nice and tight' :D
[1:00:07] roxanna_banana: more engaged is not the word i would use more like horrifying dodging things no telegraphs because blizz is too cheap to put in any
[1:00:18] roxanna_banana: and then keeping people alive
[1:00:23] seadub: @roxanna_banana ^^^
[1:00:24] seadub: lol
[1:00:27] LordConga: zeplaQthink
[1:00:30] dimi9231: dying to mobs?
[1:00:37] seadub: getting better at telegraphing them in this raid, but still bad
[1:00:54] skuull23: ff are more dance/scripted based and wow have more rng dynamic, not saying either are better just different style
[1:01:11] dimi9231: always th eloot
[1:01:25] MyotisStarcaller: but in FF i think you can't solve various mechanic diffrently
[1:01:33] MyotisStarcaller: there is one path what you have to follow each time in most cases.
[1:01:39] dimi9231: f cam
[1:01:43] dimi9231: cam is off Zep
[1:01:53] roxanna_banana: yeah u cant coz it is a dance in wow u are estimating projectiles and hoping u are not standing where it lands
[1:02:06] Lento_VI: RIP camera zeplaQrip
[1:02:09] skuull23: yeah thats what i mean by dance,
[1:02:21] stefo_is_here: @myotisstarcaller true
[1:02:22] dimi9231: @ZeplaHQ no cam
[1:02:24] MyotisStarcaller: i wish for some innovation ...
[1:02:28] roxanna_banana: also hit need on everything that will let u LOL
[1:02:31] roxanna_banana: \o/
[1:02:34] LordConga: zeplaQtired
[1:02:39] MyotisStarcaller: myotis2Oiii
[1:02:42] MyotisStarcaller: why shes gone?
[1:02:50] dimi9231: zeplaQyay
[1:02:51] dimi9231: back
[1:02:59] roxanna_banana: like what we hunters say, everything is hunter loot ahuehuehueh
[1:03:01] dimi9231: too hot for raid
[1:03:14] tanaith: It's 100 times more unforgiving
[1:03:43] tanaith: ffxiv raids are.. courteous :D
[1:03:48] roxanna_banana: aa dont run
[1:03:51] roxanna_banana: kill chain first
[1:03:52] MyotisStarcaller: the voice addon kinda feels like cheating xD
[1:03:58] MyotisStarcaller: myotis2Blep myotis2Blep
[1:04:34] skuull23: i do prefere the smaller raid size in ff reduces the severity of the  1 person messes up its wipe
[1:04:36] dimi9231: is nobbel in the raid
[1:05:02] Alastor7783: @nobbel87 are you in the raid ?
[1:05:05] MyotisStarcaller: i only wish we could have more open and dynamic mechanics to solve them in multiple ways.
[1:05:14] roxanna_banana: @skuull23 yeah asmon was talking about why he doesnt enjoy this 20man thing and then in bosses like tindral one person messes up and it is a wipe wasting the time of 19 other people
[1:05:20] dimi9231: @Alastor7783 seems not
[1:05:57] dimi9231: zeplaQJammin zeplaQJammin
[1:06:03] skuull23: @roxanna_banana pretty much this why i think my favorite wow raid memories were like kara and nax 10
[1:06:26] roxanna_banana: oh yess the classics i love those too also ICC
[1:06:28] kuvalin: oof
[1:06:39] Mewsette_kitty: don’t stack on melee
[1:06:47] dimi9231: its hot literally
[1:06:48] gdtomii: i prefer 20man raids
[1:06:53] gdtomii: feels like a good balance
[1:07:26] MyotisStarcaller: wotlk was great
[1:07:28] tanaith: Once you're hit with a spear, it won't let you leave that spot as long as it lives
[1:07:50] gdtomii: tethered to the spear until its killed
[1:07:50] dimi9231: leavers
[1:07:55] tanaith: this is NA isnt it?
[1:07:55] dimi9231: smh :D
[1:08:02] Rayz_21: classic wow players
[1:08:04] LordConga: zeplaQthink zeplaQthink
[1:08:13] skuull23: also on 20 there starts to get a lot of shit on floor from both players, but most of this is a blizz problem as they do very bad job of displaying different abilities
[1:08:15] roxanna_banana: oh that is one thing i also like about wow there is no timed lockout u can come and go as u please and they can just refill...in ff i feel bad leaving before the lockout is over
[1:08:16] Rayz_21: this is exactly why i quit tbh
[1:08:20] dimi9231: they want one shot everythins
[1:08:21] TranquilZ__: vre drakoumel
[1:08:27] MyotisStarcaller: pf expirience episode 3001
[1:08:27] tanaith: Ah that's perfect!
[1:09:11] halloni: peepoWeirdLeave
[1:09:12] dimi9231: they expect not to die
[1:09:16] tanaith: Awh my sub ran out aleady :/
[1:09:25] dimi9231: LUL
[1:09:40] Lento_VI: One of many reasons I don't raid in wow anymore zeplaQlul
[1:09:40] LordConga: zeplaQnotes
[1:09:52] dimi9231: now we wait
[1:10:21] roxanna_banana: one time i had to leave mid-raid because i got sent on chores irl and i just rejoined another group later that was on the same boss so I do not feel like i am making the group wait while i do something else
[1:10:30] dimi9231: lfg
[1:10:34] Lorrdzik: @Lento_VI this is why I raid only with community group, dont need to warry about all that bullshit
[1:10:54] dimi9231: the risk of raiding with randos
[1:11:06] skuull23: oh yeah i only  ever raid with guildies
[1:11:07] StantonSC: if only i was on EU
[1:11:24] dimi9231: usually
[1:11:31] Lento_VI: @Lorrdzik Smart move
[1:11:41] dimi9231: raid with th ebuns
[1:11:48] MyotisStarcaller: music is really loud compared to your voice @ZeplaHQ
[1:11:59] MyotisStarcaller: oh nvm xD
[1:12:03] roxanna_banana: no no u are not too late u are doing fine
[1:12:04] dimi9231: @MyotisStarcaller this
[1:12:18] StantonSC: those same people complain on week 1 tho
[1:12:24] Lorrdzik: that is true is a bit better at the start, people dont instant leave after one wipe
[1:12:26] Anbuhq: No worries, pug people expect mythic knowledge on day one
[1:12:31] dimi9231: thats not good
[1:12:49] dimi9231: music is nice
[1:12:53] Rayz_21: the fact that you have to apologize because you are learning is just something else
[1:12:58] dimi9231: lo fi
[1:13:02] MyotisStarcaller: so remind me what is the point of early leaving
[1:13:06] MyotisStarcaller: to stay afk in the town longer?
[1:13:07] halloni: wideVIBE
[1:13:23] roxanna_banana: speaking of music, did u guys notice many of the echo guys play ffxiv music while raiding especially during RWF and when they won, Emet selch started dancing on the screen
[1:13:28] tanaith: @MyotisStarcaller To find a group that wont mind carrying
[1:13:31] dimi9231: reminds me of the hc streams
[1:13:45] MyotisStarcaller: @tanaith thats one way to prog i quess
[1:13:52] dimi9231: true
[1:13:56] MyotisStarcaller: @ZeplaHQ You could increase the mic volume leaving the music in bg?
[1:14:05] dimi9231: waiting room music
[1:14:14] dimi9231: @MyotisStarcaller yes
[1:14:15] tanaith: @MyotisStarcaller We had so many people do that to us, they'd join, not pull their weight and then leave offended that they had to do their part.
[1:14:20] dimi9231: LUL
[1:14:24] MyotisStarcaller: she has beeg ears so we are the diffrent guyys
[1:14:26] MyotisStarcaller: its on us
[1:14:31] Lento_VI: 100% agree, Selly zeplaQlul
[1:14:32] MyotisStarcaller: myotis2Oiii
[1:14:56] Lorrdzik: to defend them they see raid leader progress in LFG but it doesnt mean is exactly same progress in the raid
[1:15:08] dimi9231: yeah Zep Selly sounds luder than you
[1:15:10] Lorrdzik: you can join raid with RL full clear but raid will have 0 killed bosses
[1:15:23] dimi9231: yes
[1:15:25] MyotisStarcaller: yessssssssssss
[1:15:29] skuull23: yeah very quiet to me
[1:15:30] halloni: compared to everything else yeah
[1:15:32] Alastor7783: @Lorrdzik it's usually the other way around LUL
[1:15:35] Lento_VI: Yeah, music and Selly are a bit louder than you
[1:15:38] dimi9231: you can leave the music vol
[1:15:39] tanaith: i had to mute ff to be able to hear you :D
[1:16:03] MyotisStarcaller: not really
[1:16:05] skuull23: not really
[1:16:06] dimi9231: no difference to me
[1:16:09] MyotisStarcaller: but keep on tryin
[1:16:12] MyotisStarcaller: myotis2Blep
[1:16:13] LordConga: cooperation zeplaQyay
[1:16:26] dimi9231: yes
[1:16:32] skuull23: not yet
[1:16:32] MyotisStarcaller: i don't notice a diffrence
[1:16:36] Armatilo: did zorpla quit genshinn
[1:16:43] dimi9231: your are good
[1:16:44] Lorrdzik: @Alastor7783 From my pugging expierience I saw a bit of groups with full clear raid progress but raid wasnt cleared
[1:16:47] roxanna_banana: it shows on the listing yea
[1:16:56] Lorrdzik: dont see, you only see raid leader lockout
[1:16:57] gdtomii: they see on the raid listing how many bosses have been killed
[1:17:16] LordConga: zeplaQthink
[1:17:19] dimi9231: the music can stay the wai it is
[1:17:24] MyotisStarcaller: do you use an obs ? @ZeplaHQ
[1:17:27] roxanna_banana: if u guys only have 2 healers u can kick a bunch of dps until the group is down to 10 people but that would be sad for them
[1:17:35] Lento_VI: She quit Genshin to play FFXIV, quit FFXIV to play wow and will be quitting wow to play Genshin
[1:17:41] Alastor7783: anniesAYAYA genshin
[1:18:06] dimi9231: for the primogems
[1:18:13] Zaiz_En: @ZeplaHQ there has been twitch news about pay
[1:18:25] dimi9231: they are rare
[1:18:29] Mewsette_kitty: husband O’s sounds like a breakfast cereal
[1:18:31] roxanna_banana: Zepla have u tried palworld?
[1:18:46] ShadowDancer___: darkho32JAM
[1:19:00] dimi9231: true
[1:19:10] Lorrdzik: exactly
[1:19:14] MyotisStarcaller: So mic might have a sensitivity in regard towards the noise cancallation
[1:19:15] dimi9231: its a bit rough here
[1:19:22] MyotisStarcaller: that might lower the output volume for us.
[1:19:34] MyotisStarcaller: There can be a software what does control it so that's lower
[1:19:51] dimi9231: you sound ok now
[1:20:00] MyotisStarcaller: ok
[1:20:13] dimi9231: we ready
[1:20:15] roxanna_banana: ur voice was ok until the ready check startled us
[1:20:20] MyotisStarcaller: lol i was ready to click ready
[1:20:23] MyotisStarcaller: xD
[1:21:03] roxanna_banana: ohh we need to help Zepla get her druid forms
[1:21:15] roxanna_banana: her customiaztions
[1:21:43] Callidor: As a 14 player, looking at WoW people's UIs just seems completely baffling to me
[1:21:51] skuull23: i feel a bit of this mentality comes from that wow is more punishing for wiping/failing then ff14
[1:22:12] Alastor7783: zepla's UI is just unhinged
[1:22:14] Alastor7783: we're not all like that
[1:22:21] MyotisStarcaller: @skuull23 until ultimate :P
[1:22:23] dimi9231: @skuull23 especially the run back when you die
[1:22:34] roxanna_banana: aaaa dont move
[1:22:51] roxanna_banana: yea kill the spear first u are tethered to before moving
[1:23:06] skuull23: @MyotisStarcaller does ultimate change things like run back and rebuffing etc?
[1:23:38] roxanna_banana: u are doing great
[1:23:43] dimi9231: tree form
[1:23:48] MyotisStarcaller: running is meant to slow down the game so people kinda play longer
[1:24:07] MyotisStarcaller: basicly also it should let people focus more instead of pushing again&again
[1:24:14] skuull23: well it makes me not want to raid :p
[1:24:27] MyotisStarcaller: but in ultimate the fight is way longer and if you wipe it does start from a very first fight
[1:24:42] dimi9231: nice dodging
[1:24:48] MyotisStarcaller: or a boss whatever you would call it
[1:24:55] dimi9231: zeplaQyay
[1:25:03] roxanna_banana: almost over u did great Zepla!
[1:25:06] dimi9231: vault
[1:25:07] rip_jimmywopo: gg
[1:25:10] Lorrdzik: zeplaQyay zeplaQyay
[1:25:37] MyotisStarcaller: for sure wow keeps the things more dynamic instead of static adjustments
[1:25:43] HerpsterKKat: zepla what the hell is that loot window
[1:25:51] dimi9231: ring is an upgrade
[1:25:54] rob487h: Hello Zepla <3 Hi everybun zeplaQwave

[1:27:23] LordConga: zeplaQnotes zeplaQnotes
[1:28:02] dimi9231: we are back to the traditional wow music

[1:28:43] LordConga: zeplaQthink
[1:28:51] Varae__: fire=hot
[1:28:58] dimi9231: this is ragnaros vibes
[1:29:16] Lorrdzik: one tank souldnt tank both big golems, they hit hard
[1:29:17] roxanna_banana: ya he is also a firelord thats why
[1:29:41] LordConga: zeplaQthink zeplaQnotes
[1:29:42] dimi9231: it can be waytoodank
[1:29:52] skuull23: the raid is basically firelands 2.0
[1:30:08] roxanna_banana: the boss does tho too during the fight heh so watch the tail the shadow will be casted where it will slam dodge it and then buncha fire
[1:30:18] dimi9231: so who is the finl bos? fyrakk?
[1:30:37] xKillerbees: The current music sounds so same to a lot of other wow music.
[1:30:44] roxanna_banana: yea fyrakk
[1:30:48] MyotisStarcaller: how you can see your character with all those green healing numbers is beyond me
[1:30:57] dimi9231: ok
[1:31:15] dknamey: wait so if fyrakk is the new firelord does he got sent back to the firelands or dead dead
[1:31:24] dimi9231: soits basically the end of dragonflight story?
[1:31:33] skuull23: fyrakk isnt the new firelord
[1:31:34] Alastor7783: fyrakk is not the new firelord
[1:31:49] LordConga: zeplaQthink zeplaQraid
[1:31:50] dknamey: didnt he absorb smolderon's essence and became one?
[1:31:58] roxanna_banana: yea he is not a firelord he is actually a dragon
[1:32:00] dimi9231: is he a primalist dragon
[1:32:04] gdtomii: aspect
[1:32:38] roxanna_banana: lol that boomkin just hover flying looks like a balloon coz he is so fat
[1:32:58] LordConga: Big damage zeplaQtired
[1:32:59] dimi9231: fire snake
[1:33:23] roxanna_banana: i didnt hear them assign split soaks O_o
[1:33:26] roxanna_banana: did i miss it?
[1:33:33] Fossabot: You ever see other chatters write weird words and wonder what the heck is going on? Well don't worry, they're emotes from a (trusted) browser plugin, which you can find here 7TV: https://7tv.app
[1:33:58] roxanna_banana: ruun
[1:34:00] roxanna_banana: ooos
[1:34:00] dknamey: lookUp
[1:34:02] roxanna_banana: yea tail
[1:34:12] dimi9231: now we know
[1:34:15] LordConga: zeplaQPOG
[1:34:26] dimi9231: so much stuff on screen
[1:34:32] Lento_VI: zeplaQnotes
[1:35:04] dimi9231: no room left
[1:35:45] dimi9231: literally
[1:35:47] LordConga: zeplaQevil
[1:36:06] dimi9231: agane
[1:36:08] roxanna_banana: just 2
[1:36:19] dimi9231: why leave when kill boss?
[1:36:25] Reminii91: to get carried
[1:36:25] dimi9231: thats strange
[1:36:44] roxanna_banana: sometimes i just pop in to one boss (council for example) and if the trinket doesnt drop i leave...if the trinket drops....i also leave coz i dont need the other ones >.<
[1:37:13] dimi9231: idk seems a bad etiquette to me
[1:37:26] skuull23: yeah sometimes you might be targeting 1 item, or just want like 4/10 bosses for week or whatever number
[1:37:30] roxanna_banana: i knooow they even have a name for it loot and scoot -.-'
[1:37:54] dimi9231: LUL
[1:38:27] LordConga: zeplaQthink zeplaQthink
[1:38:33] Lorrdzik: overall m+ is better for the gear because of the vault you can get mythic ilvl gear
[1:38:35] dimi9231: how many players are we missing
[1:39:00] Lorrdzik: and you can get tier gear too from vault so raid is not needed at all, only if specific trinket is really good for you
[1:39:20] dimi9231: should be fast
[1:39:21] Lento_VI: Wasn't like this in my day! *waves cane at monitor*
[1:39:29] dimi9231: yeah
[1:39:43] gdtomii: Heroic is really easy to find people for
[1:39:47] dimi9231: refill is fast
[1:39:53] roxanna_banana: btw i just realized my sub expired sighhh
[1:40:11] dimi9231: everyone is queueuing for the loot
[1:40:43] LordConga: zeplaQnotes zeplaQnotes
[1:40:51] skuull23: the only time it wasnt like this was when we didnt have lfr/lfd tools so it took ages to find/assemble group so was worth the time to stick with group when you got it
[1:41:07] gdtomii: Would assume Tranquility is best used on the Serpents fury that happens after a group soak
[1:41:21] LordConga: zeplaQthink zeplaQnotes
[1:41:35] Zaiz_En: Zep when ever you say duty finder I hear Doodie finder.
[1:41:36] dimi9231: need a heal or a tank
[1:41:37] Zaiz_En: that is all
[1:42:15] dimi9231: guildies to the rescue?
[1:42:55] dimi9231: cooperation
[1:43:21] dimi9231: we are full
[1:43:23] dknamey: yeah after you got knocked
[1:43:40] MyotisStarcaller: Will you perhaps play a pokimon gungame
[1:43:41] MyotisStarcaller: ?
[1:43:53] dimi9231: hope no one leaves
[1:44:10] LordConga: zeplaQraid zeplaQraid
[1:44:31] Lento_VI: At least it fills up pretty quick

[1:48:10] roxanna_banana: u did great as that is not a fun boss to heal since u can get 3-4 mechanics all at once
[1:48:34] Zaiz_En: *kill boss* BYE HALF OF PARTY
[1:48:37] dimi9231: people leaving gets exhausting
[1:48:54] tanaith: flap!
[1:48:57] dimi9231: nice lava bath
[1:49:15] dimi9231: would be faster
[1:49:31] gdtomii: KEKW
[1:49:34] gdtomii: gg's tho
[1:49:51] dimi9231: isnt leaving considered griefing
[1:49:54] nightst314: Larodar needs a lot of coordination compared to the bosses before.
[1:49:58] gdtomii: not really
[1:50:12] gdtomii: everyone goes in and out of groups
[1:50:23] dimi9231: its a cluster
[1:50:25] Lento_VI: You did great for a first attempt
[1:50:34] ver_flashbang: puggings gives you a lot more freedom with your time but a heroic guild is still so much more time efficient
[1:50:57] dimi9231: do you have the lockdown
[1:51:10] dimi9231: LUL
[1:51:11] Zaiz_En: Cmon bro, No one wants a Zepla in their guild :O
[1:51:40] dimi9231: you were healing great yesterday
[1:51:46] Lorrdzik: if you would raid on Friday maybe you could join our raid from Annie's community LUL
[1:51:53] dknamey: if you havent done normals the final boss drops heroic level trinkets
[1:52:00] Alastor7783: ^
[1:52:02] Alastor7783: join offline chat
[1:52:05] Alastor7783: but we on ravencrest

[1:52:12] tanaith: We chronically need more healers XD
[1:52:20] tanaith: ravencrest as well
[1:52:24] Alastor7783: Fridays at 8
[1:52:27] Alastor7783: yea
[1:52:28] Lorrdzik: yes you can
[1:52:30] Alastor7783: HC is cross realm
[1:52:36] dimi9231: have you got saved progress
[1:52:48] Lorrdzik: saved proigress on these bosses doesnt matter
[1:52:57] dimi9231: the raid lockdown?
[1:53:09] gdtomii: lockout doesnt matter unless its mythic
[1:53:12] Lorrdzik: you can join hc/normal raid even if you kill all bosses before
[1:53:12] dimi9231: its fast
[1:53:32] dimi9231: trur
[1:53:35] dimi9231: true
[1:53:43] skuull23: true
[1:53:45] Varae__: You can run 10 man
[1:53:46] tanaith: you log
[1:53:54] ver_flashbang: if it's just heroic you can just do 10-14 man it
[1:54:04] likertwo: Just do a 10 man, its much easier
[1:54:13] gdtomii: on non-mythic difficulties you can just do 10man
[1:54:14] tanaith: ^
[1:54:33] dimi9231: try it
[1:54:41] Toldarro: sometimes that fucks you over with certain mechanics
[1:54:41] likertwo: WoW has Flex Sizing, 2/2/6
[1:54:46] xCD80: not like ff14?
[1:54:51] ver_flashbang: depending on the boss scaling 10 man can be quite painful though haha

[1:55:09] gdtomii: flex scaling has been pretty good this raid
[1:55:11] likertwo: @ver_flashbang They fixed most of the bosses to be easier for small raids
[1:55:16] Alastor7783: D: leaked tactics
[1:55:17] gdtomii: especially after Tindral tuning
[1:56:06] ver_flashbang: @ver_flashbang I still haev Mistress Sassz'ine flashbacks from legion
[1:56:08] dknamey: NOTED
[1:57:08] dimi9231: clearing fire
[1:57:31] dimi9231: you will be the fire fighter
[1:57:40] tanaith: If the fight takes long enough, everyone might need to do that ;P
[1:58:02] roxanna_banana: make the hunter do janitor fire work u are busy enough healing
[1:58:35] dimi9231: big healing
[1:58:39] gdtomii: healer ffight

[2:00:12] tanaith: Healers should just focus on the trees/brambles, right?
[2:00:14] roxanna_banana: when i am healing i just push all possible mechanics to the hunters :D
[2:00:18] dimi9231: oh no

[2:00:24] Dranni21312: let's see it KEKW

[2:00:33] tanaith: everything else should not require their attention?
[2:00:38] Herclon: orcish?
[2:00:54] dimi9231: horde language?
[2:01:01] LordConga: zeplaQPOG
[2:01:01] trynsheriu: big thing for this one is just healing the bramble and trees... and use the firehose
[2:01:08] dimi9231: LUL
[2:01:12] dimi9231: its everywhere
[2:01:20] Lento_VI: Them and everybody else it seems

[2:02:15] Nkwow: Yes, it's turkish
[2:02:17] dimi9231: mobs already chasing
[2:02:59] dimi9231: they should put portals shortcut
[2:03:25] trynsheriu: that's pretty much it
[2:03:33] roxanna_banana: yessss that’s ur priority let the dps worry about the rest
[2:03:46] tanaith: flap! XD
[2:04:06] dimi9231: you got this
[2:04:15] trynsheriu: what difficulty is this?
[2:04:29] dimi9231: heroic
[2:04:35] Dranni21312: heroic xenoNODDERS
[2:04:45] roxanna_banana: I believe \o/ honestly you are a better player than many people that have been raiding heroic longer
[2:04:51] dimi9231: zeplaQraid
[2:04:58] trynsheriu: nice, I just beat it the other day lol. Tinddral will be fuuuuuunnn

[2:06:58] roxanna_banana: oh yea pop stampeding roar for that ok so they can run away from the boss
[2:07:00] ShadowDancer___: More? 😢
[2:07:12] trynsheriu: phase 2 is honestly easier lol, basically a dps check
[2:07:36] ShadowDancer___: "Mm mm..get somebody else to do it.."
[2:07:40] roxanna_banana: u have mass root and typhoon anyway right
[2:07:43] dimi9231: NotLikeThis
[2:07:48] dimi9231: thats a doozie
[2:08:23] roxanna_banana: oh yea use iron bark on that tank
[2:08:26] dimi9231: thats final boss level of mechanics
[2:08:32] roxanna_banana: and stand in melee
[2:09:18] trynsheriu: and Tindral is WORSE lmao
[2:09:27] Lento_VI: I'd remember maybe half of that on a good day
[2:09:29] trynsheriu: this is one of the "wall" bosses
[2:09:29] dimi9231: maybe you will remember better when you see it in action
[2:09:34] roxanna_banana: nuuu it only sounds bad on paper I promise u are doing great
[2:09:39] dimi9231: you got this Zep
[2:09:46] dimi9231: we believe in you

[2:13:09] dknamey: adds dying in the fire LuL
[2:13:34] Reminii91: her unit frame so confusing
[2:13:51] roxanna_banana: he is at 90 energy
[2:14:03] roxanna_banana: aaaa yea need to have the thing healed to full before he hits 100 energy
[2:14:03] Lento_VI: zeplaQthink
[2:14:08] tanaith: no bramble, no shield :(
[2:14:09] dimi9231: he is hard
[2:14:10] Herclon: tree placement was eh
[2:14:25] Alastor7783: larodar is one of the harder bosses in the raid
[2:14:40] HerpsterKKat: this turkish group is no delight for sure har har har
[2:14:45] dimi9231: you did what you could and was expected dw zeplaQheart
[2:14:53] flip_ie: looked like it took the dps too long to destroy the bramble too
[2:15:05] roxanna_banana: i am more wondering about ur cohealers tbh
[2:15:07] Lento_VI: @HerpsterKKat Bravo zeplaQlul
[2:15:08] Herclon: the trees were taking damag from the fire patches
[2:15:29] trynsheriu: dps some times forgoet about the bramble
[2:15:31] dimi9231: i dont think it was your fault
[2:15:33] roxanna_banana: tree placement bad
[2:15:36] roxanna_banana: yea what he said
[2:15:42] dimi9231: maybe its for the better
[2:15:44] Dranni21312: @HerpsterKKat KEKW
[2:15:55] dimi9231: yep
[2:16:00] trynsheriu: took me a month to finally be tindral pugging...
[2:16:03] roxanna_banana: run keys for now
[2:16:05] dimi9231: mythic +
[2:16:07] Dranni21312: pug experience classicc
[2:16:16] Lento_VI: Gotta go with a guild / community group I think
[2:16:21] tanaith: You might need a bit higher Ilvl for HC
[2:16:35] Alastor7783: yoin offline chat on friday YEP
[2:16:39] dimi9231: and they themsleves dotn know most of the time
[2:16:45] for_za_: pugging the heroic raid was way easier earlier on in the season but most people stopped with heroic so pugs are rough now.
[2:16:45] ver_flashbang: it's better in the early weeks but a month in or so every just wants farm groups
[2:16:51] baggytrousers: World of Warcraft culture Despairge
[2:16:53] dimi9231: LUL
[2:17:18] dimi9231: heroic raids actually harder than m+
[2:17:25] xCD80: is the raid bigger than in ff14?
[2:17:31] dimi9231: dw you were doing your best
[2:17:35] roxanna_banana: i think u were fine tbh ... those trees were standing in fire.....
[2:17:37] Dranni21312: @xCD80 9 bosses
[2:17:50] xCD80: =O
[2:17:54] Varae__: that's just PuG-life, it's very low investment so people have no incentive to stick around in groups that aren't doing well this late in the patch
[2:18:22] Varae__: makes it very hard to learn though
[2:19:05] for_za_: best day to pug heroic with a good group is Tuesday I’ve found
[2:19:07] dimi9231: till you can
