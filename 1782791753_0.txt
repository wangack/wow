[0:24:47] Ghostauren: Plink, also known as Plink Cat, is a Twitch emote and online reaction GIF of a white cat blinking while looking into the camera, which became popularized after its inclusion into Twitch chats as a 7TV and BetterTTV feature in late 2022 and early 2023, as well as its use as a Discord emote. The cat's dead stare, combined with its slow blink, caused it to become prominently used in livestreams when chat is watching the streamer perform an action or trick in a game.
