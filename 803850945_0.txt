[1:12:30] akromayep: how did the test of the release go ? did it go smoothly ?
[1:12:39] Gotchesky: What is the reason to farm this rare monsters if your ilvl is 100+?

[1:15:20] Sarocus: We'll see all the haters in game at launch :)
[1:15:22] danimoto10: OLY SHIT 8 DAYSSS
[1:15:22] tocu: I think some of it is the level squish and removing corruption like a month ago so you feel downpowered before the exspansion comes out
[1:15:31] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @Towelliee Each piece of loot sadly has a single digit percent drop chance, but each piece of loot has its own drop roll. So you can luck out and get multiple pieces off 1 rare.
[1:15:38] quakegoogl: lol
[1:15:41] blinca: ive been so busy with studying that i havent bought shadowlands yet lol
[1:15:47] Thunderbrew: Ain't gonna be a problem for 2 days, maybe 2 hours.
[1:16:28] Zettabyte: imagine having cross region in WoW FeelsBadMan
[1:16:41] Motivess: I am on Uldaman which is usually a low pop server
[1:16:45] Tazhaar93: I'm on EU's biggest server, this launch might be a shitshow
[1:16:59] ijuki: @Tazhaar93 Silvermoon?
[1:17:04] NILLme: wait till you lose the neck and the azerite :D
[1:17:08] lordofthefries42069: why not jst servr transfer for a few days
[1:17:09] crazyWildcatfan: i never played wow but looking to get into a good mmorpg, would shadowlands be a good place to start or am i just too far behind?
[1:17:12] Gingerprimer: @Tazhaar93 Silvermoon?
[1:17:19] Tazhaar93: @ijuki Isn't Draenor bigger?
[1:17:21] Dwarfi: Blizzard can, Acticision cant
[1:17:40] Thunderbrew: @crazyWildcatfan Starting a Shadowlands will be perfect
[1:17:40] Shrenko: Blizz watching
[1:17:42] xxKrayzie: rigged
[1:17:43] PracTlKaL: Your neck was 110
[1:18:06] crazyWildcatfan: @Thunderbrew thx for the advice!!!
[1:18:09] AdmiralRanmaru: @Towelliee I loved when people bragged of how good they were with corruption when their damage came mostly from corruption. just to see them brought down with the removal of that and squish
[1:18:09] ijuki: @Tazhaar93 I think Silvermoon is bigger
[1:18:17] TomCat: towCheer300 what game is this?
[1:18:29] blinca: are we just going to ignore that big mandingo sword on silithus though?
[1:18:32] Funderik: moral of the story is, blizzard can't win no matter what
[1:18:36] klabauters: Hey @Towelliee what is this rare-addon youre using? sorry if you answered it before! Thank you!
[1:18:36] Gingerprimer: @Tazhaar93 you were right it is a little bit bigger I think still so many servers will be shitshow
[1:18:36] Colt_Engineer: KEKW
[1:18:36] tocu: I am more thinking the squish should have happened maybe a week before this event not way before
[1:18:36] Sarocus: @crazyWildcatfan Right now is actually a great time to start
[1:18:41] MrGattz: its called Runescape
[1:18:43] MrGattz: brand new game
[1:18:46] LoseAlotLuke: is this the new destiny expansion :)
[1:18:49] Tazhaar93: @ijuki My bad, But I think the bigger server will melt. All players funneld into one zone
[1:18:51] Colt_Engineer: lol @MrGattz
[1:18:53] gravebanes1: @Towelliee have they changed the spawn timer on the rares ?
[1:18:57] Elichikaayase: wow is dead Is this on private server?
[1:18:59] Brisly30: Lol Tom
[1:18:59] ejp4991: @chat dont mention the c word you will get timed out for 600 seconds
[1:19:00] crazyWildcatfan: @Sarocus thx!!!
[1:19:00] Motivess: @crazyWildcatfan I would start now and get a character ready for the release, otherwise you will need to lvl up to shadowlands before you cna play it
[1:19:00] Rymaster227: how do you think the casual community will receive the covenant system. think they'll hate it as much as the top player base?
[1:19:02] ijuki: @MrGattz World of Runescape maybe Kappa
[1:19:03] HENISSAy: where he leave now ?
[1:19:06] Colt_Engineer: after months of bitching

[1:19:21] GnomeLickerGames: waiting for SQUISH ment we got no time to adjust to the changes before launch
[1:19:23] tocu: I was always good with corruption just not the aquisition that they fixed
[1:19:26] Daroff: Corruption was one of the worst mechanics ever implemented into the game...
[1:19:29] ijuki: Oh, I got golden Kappa POGGERS

[1:19:56] AdmiralRanmaru: @Towelliee the complainers sound like my father. No matter what, always complaining about something.
[1:19:56] pedrodepacas1: complaining is the new meta, people just need to play the game
[1:19:59] SpoofAvatar: GARRISON WAS THE BEST
[1:20:01] 3663Sharad: LUL
[1:20:05] blinca: the aoe cap sucks though
[1:20:05] RuineMi: to be fair essences were great, it was just the non account bound that sucked

[1:20:37] TheCliffyShow: Everything sucks until we've moved on to the next thing then that thing sucks and the old thing was awesome.
[1:20:45] GnomeLickerGames: borrow power is just bad systems no borrow power this argument would not exist

[1:21:17] troile87: @Towelliee you can kill the again
[1:21:17] Tazhaar93: Is there an achievement for this pre-patch event?
[1:21:18] DucklingTV: how many times can you loot a rare in 1 day?
[1:21:21] ctrium: may I ask what is killing rares for? just a gearing up alts? and getting pet?
[1:21:22] kjdocs: you can keep killing, you still get loot
[1:21:24] Colt_Engineer: YEESSSS
[1:21:27] Motivess: Legion did not start in a good place
[1:21:28] Thunderbrew: I refuse to read forums. Trying to remove negative from my life. Watching streams is as negative as I can get.
[1:21:29] kjdocs: i'm doing same thing

[2:21:06] cahoots82: Good. It should be
[2:21:09] PToastman: if pelagos gets nerfed so many covenant recommendations will change
[2:21:13] cahoots82: Blizz fucked this so hard.
[2:21:21] NestLucky: thanks
[2:21:30] NubJ: big yikes
[2:21:30] Horuseternal69: 100% pelagos will get nerfed without a shadow of a doubt

[2:21:50] l0stprice: is DH any good rn? :D
[2:21:51] BubbaLuvva: sorry whats the rare spawn addon for icecrown?
[2:21:56] Lazyloa: Can't be too surprised, Kyrian is most vanilla for fan base, like Overwatch covenant
[2:21:58] LoseAlotLuke: literally because of Pelagos and Kleia not because of the covenent spells which is crazy @Towelliee
[2:22:03] Cinzano_Bianco: best way of balancing is to make everything equally crap :D
[2:22:04] Zomgboy: if its gonna be nerfed afterwards it sucks hard
[2:22:23] Zomgboy: everyone would have to reconcider their choise
[2:22:36] vylh: imagine nerfing covenants after release
[2:22:43] vylh: ouf
[2:22:48] cahoots82: @l0stprice DH is middle of the back. It's not going to be BfA stronk, but it's fine. Plus every raid is going to want one for the debuff alone.
[2:22:55] Lightian: I can see KEKW memes coming about post release nerfs for certain covenants @Towelliee
[2:23:04] Kromede: the popping sounds NotLikeThis

[2:23:16] mab_music_ttrpg: i recently swtich reroll to paladin, which covenant is bis for pal at launch if nothing chance ?
[2:23:16] dracullus: @Towelliee if I switch Covenant, conduit collection is the same or I have different set to collect?
[2:23:20] vylh: All the P's
[2:23:31] Falthel: or they could of designed them all to have the same type of path when they "changed" them
[2:23:52] Xedeffen: Pela-geese?
[2:23:54] BubbaLuvva: whats that rare creature log addon?
[2:23:55] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I don't expect to raid or push keys, so all my covenant choices are based on transmog for that character
[2:24:29] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[2:24:37] Sepulchair: Necrolord is best for everything, because it looks the best
[2:24:42] MOLAR305: DH m+ is kyrian, raiding could be argued Venthyr

[2:25:58] AnDy_the_Dj: Each expansion is sepparate
[2:26:02] PToastman: rogue covenants are very close
[2:26:05] MarquisLek: i'm a druid so i'm gonna convoke the spirits
[2:26:13] Sepulchair: Still going Necrolord as Unholy. I don't care if it's the worst

[2:26:56] parlangua89: Covenants and mid maxing that is for people who want that 1%.
[2:26:56] Collected1: heel the wooonds
[2:27:02] Shrapnel_Sponge: I was going venthyr on my DK because of the blood and stuff, but I hear that Venthyr is going to be best for M+ so I feel less special now LUL
[2:27:11] MrGattz: it gets to a point where so many people are saying so many things that its not worth trying to figure out which is legit and youre better off just picking your fav
[2:27:12] Seerated: One or several more tuning passes and all those 'current' spreadsheets are useless
[2:27:15] maalow: venthyr on BDK, and it's a good ability so i'm fine

[2:28:35] robbiev45: Hey @towelliee and chat. How ya'll doing?
[2:28:43] Stawnchy: That is nothing new.. I was given shit in Wrath for having one point spent wrong in my talent tree...
[2:28:45] thisisathrowaway12: essences and Az traits are a really bad example of that though because it was never just 1%
[2:28:47] RedLemonadeX: Is this diablo 2 music? :D
[2:28:49] Seerated: Now until release everything is still up in the air. I'll bother with it after I'm 60 and it's more set/stable
[2:29:04] dracullus: @Towelliee on normal/heroic raid level it will be funny to see better players with 'wrong' covenant smashing bad players with 'bis' covenant, I saw it many times with fotm dps specs
[2:29:10] Zivs: the kyrian ability looks so fkin cool

[3:24:10] GermanBacon: now blood though
[3:24:12] shevek1337: bm is just the most boring spec
[3:24:17] GermanBacon: no*
[3:24:20] at1c: She is mad bro
[3:24:23] NILLme: meanwhile they censored the word "bitch"
[3:24:25] Chusca: it was so cool
[3:24:26] Baldarsar: but you did not see it
[3:24:28] wpprrz: There wasnt any gore @Towelliee
[3:24:29] mysteriousm4n: @Towelliee they can cut someone's head off but garrosh can't say bitch lmfao
[3:24:31] Thunderbrew: Will Tyrande be a major part of Shadowlands?
[3:24:35] wpprrz: Or any visual violence
[3:24:40] MarquisLek: implied gore
[3:24:42] MILESkg21: LUL
[3:24:44] PadidinJones: I think Sylvanas V Saurfang was more graphic though.
[3:24:50] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: When did they censor bitch?
[3:24:50] Gooseberries: Cause girl power
[3:24:59] BearOfLight: Umm, I think she did more than a slit. just saying
[3:25:00] pizzasauce: and poop cant be in a char name.
[3:25:01] theszoti: imagine tyrande calls sylvanas bitch
[3:25:09] ZakuzaGB: its tyridan now boyz
[3:25:10] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I remember in Cata, some Orc general called Sylvanas a bitch
[3:25:10] Barrosy: What do you expect, it's a game, it's expected to have some type of gore
[3:25:13] at1c: To be fair "bitch" always felt out of place there. Is there evens wearing the game outside of that 1 instans?
[3:25:18] kohwai: Do you think Tyrande will snap and become Sylvanas 2.0?
[3:25:34] Asuo_: @Towelliee Isn't that because the head writer for a while was really in Sylvannas and esentially made Nethanos to simp in game? Also didnt he edit lines like "you bitch"
[3:25:35] Barrosy: I don't get censorship in games at all tbh unless it's a game really targeted for young children
[3:25:36] AgentWhiskeyy: That‚Äôs funny because bitch is usually uncensored majority of the times it‚Äôs used on air lol
