[2:02:25] bangbangdeveloper: Aren't rep weapons also t1 equivalent? Kind of shit very fast at 60, so might as well pump the rep

[2:21:30] GTokie: thats why blizzard turned off wow for china
[2:21:33] StandardOut: What was the point?
[2:21:33] IrisFromAlaska: why every shit starts frokm china
[2:21:35] TobyNova: RIB MAN
[2:21:38] sovngardener: first time i saw one was around 2020, a bit before aq came out on classic
[2:21:44] chickodie: YOU A RIB MAN
[2:21:47] chickodie: DO FOR THE RIB
[2:21:56] StandardOut: He was the ribman
[2:22:11] karrots96: would you advocate for personal loot system, like they did in BFD/SL?
[2:22:23] chickodie: i bet
[2:22:34] GTokie: im sure it could but its risky
[2:22:35] jrandolph21: it does people can live on it
[2:22:38] 0xshan: In venezuela you can
[2:22:45] Phav: Venezuelan gold farmers in RuneScape make more money than doctors in their country
[2:22:50] GTokie: i dont know the cost of living in china, and how easily you can automate the farming process
[2:22:54] karrots96: it was decent back in 2004-10. But now it wont be enough these days. China economy has grown so much and things are much more expensive now
[2:23:00] xswamps: It 100% does
[2:23:04] mixx10211: no
[2:23:05] Wicks_TV: pros and cons

[2:23:09] Tdoh__: group loot?
[2:23:09] kigami_uro: Sonii doesnt like because he cant funnel :P
[2:23:11] xswamps: I rather lose my gear then have personal loot
[2:23:12] lurskii: y not same feelin
[2:23:20] jrandolph21: knew a lady from philapeans who made a living from it
[2:23:21] tazzlol: if it meant my BIS items werent going to plebs id like personal loot
[2:23:22] procrastoad: how come you bever played rogue in sod @SONII
[2:23:24] BadGerbilLion: If personal loot made me roll and a 95-100 roll gives an epic or something Id be down
[2:23:26] Grooveii: removes a lot of the whole mmorpg feel, cooperating to take down bosses and split the spoils
[2:23:30] Tdoh__: ooo no thats weird
[2:23:30] mixx10211: what about the thunderfury
[2:23:40] mixx10211: just persnoal loot thunderfury kek
[2:23:41] Wicks_TV: @BadGerbilLion thats a funny idea i like that
[2:23:45] GTokie: people would be armor type stackin like cray
[2:23:52] tazzlol: they are, but it hurts my soul
[2:24:09] Ilove_togetwet: confucius say, GDKP bess way
[2:24:13] Wicks_TV: sounds like you have a weird complex @tazzlol
[2:24:16] ins0mn: having have the ability to roll for a change to an extra loot once per raid would be nice.
[2:24:28] HoganJ13: what sucks is losing 3 pieces of upgrade gear to 1 person and them not sharing as a normal raid party would
[2:24:30] pogxgaming: @SONII Do you think cuddling with your girl all day is a waste of time jw?
[2:24:47] tns_sensei: cuddle with the boys instead
[2:24:53] bigchurchman: real ^
[2:24:54] AgentIce99: lmao
[2:24:56] IrisFromAlaska: liar,girls are not real
[2:24:59] KeyvanB_: I like the idea of adding Hardmode to the SoD raids and have it not drop diff loot but just drop 1-2 more pieces on that boss
[2:25:02] Ddocz: @tns_sensei it's only gay if you enjoy it
[2:25:03] pogxgaming: @SONII All she wants to do is cuddle and shit all day im like fuck no im playing wow i got to raid

[2:29:04] epidemicttv: People probably didn't have as much expendable income as we do now.
[2:29:06] KeyvanB_: I stopped boosting cause ZG/Mara was nothing but bots
[2:29:07] TobyNova: nothing like now though
[2:29:09] MattOriginal: you should watch Asmon's video from BFD from like 4 years ago with the hundreds of Druids in one spot

[2:30:26] Akileys: what addon was that you can switch your gear?
[2:30:27] Esoterikk: Blizzard was more active banning gold buyers thats why now everyone buys gold, ahmpy even streams constant GDKPs filled with them
[2:30:36] BlownFuse_: I will one day for sure
[2:30:37] BadGerbilLion: I got a hair transplant but not on my head
[2:30:41] Ragingdane: Whats the command for the clip of sonii churning butter?
[2:30:42] PeterZwegatStarcraft: i got my hairtransplant 2 months ago in thailand
[2:30:47] Ilove_togetwet: i glued my shaved pubes to my chin to try and grow a beard, does that count?
[2:30:49] Ragingdane: While fucking slamming to a song?
[2:30:52] tmacd: my dad did back in the day …plugs
[2:30:55] Dam_Str8: they have newer treatments these days you don't need transplants
[2:30:56] tsetse2fly: @SONII Mitch's hair thing was nothing, they didn't even do much. And think it was in LA
[2:30:58] 404Connor: its a snowball effect
[2:30:59] 123Sepi123: wouldnt hairtranplant also just fall off?

[2:31:33] nofrontin: cause u buy a new 2 month membership + new gold
[2:31:37] nofrontin: 5Head
[2:31:43] KeyvanB_: @SONII It was equally as bad with bots back in Classic re-release. I stopped boosting because bots were just spamming ZG/Mara boosts 24/7 and never get banned
[2:31:43] zipther: Sonii any chance you logged that BFD on warr? Wondered about parse on first boss before I was mentally challenged...
[2:31:45] hunigsbase: you could also just be virile and not need a transplant
[2:31:48] tmacd: same thing I tjink
[2:31:49] rosso5792: waiting on the gf guy to say hes had a transplant already
[2:31:53] chickodie: The amount of bots are determined by the amount of gold buyers. Supply and demand, so with the large influx of new players coming to SoD, they have no clue how to make gold and just buy it.
[2:32:03] Ragingdane: @SONII Whats the command for the clip with u churning butter while turning up music and fucking vibing like a madmann?
[2:32:03] AdamNicholsMusic: @rosso5792 KEKW

[2:38:33] hozahwow: thats a good question
[2:38:35] frewdin: Looks like a fun game to try.
[2:38:38] StandardOut: software limitations
[2:38:41] StandardOut: hosting limitations
[2:38:43] feardotrun: poor servers and networking

[2:39:08] sheeeeszh: they fuel retail and classic/ERA/SoD are just sideprojects
[2:39:08] ThatManDill: sonii whatcha think of palworld?
[2:39:10] zipther: Poor infrastructure that's "too expensive to replace"
[2:39:14] sovngardener: northdale had insane events, it was the biggest pserver ive played before classic came out in 2018-19, and the lag was nonexistant, just frames drops and that was it
[2:39:19] Ragingdane: :D

[2:43:02] Dam_Str8: Well layering helped me get Humar Pridelord, LOL
[2:43:04] Ilove_togetwet: i did
[2:43:08] sheeeeszh: Imagine premades in Phase 2, where gnomes will be able to make engi X-rays - horde will pretty much be irrelevant in premades
[2:43:13] alexnettlez: the premade issue is unreal you cant pvp solo and you cant pvp in a premade
[2:43:25] noose9k: 10 raiders from noose9k have joined!

[2:43:47] GlitterPig1X: games gonna be so fast in AB
[2:43:51] rosso5792: 10 man raid Pog
[2:44:01] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: when i ranked to 14 back in the day and ran a premade. the other team just afked out when they saw us
[2:44:06] beefstr0321: they need to fix the bg system for sure
[2:44:08] rutzki: if i get 5capped i aint ressing KEKW
[2:44:12] Grimmzsix: then you dont take the Rez and the game ends in 2 mins
[2:44:17] Nightbot: GHOST is having a buy one get one 50% off sale on ALL protein powder, use code "SONII" for an additional 20% off!!! ghostlifestyle.com // uk.ghostlifestyle.com
[2:44:43] jschroe3: whats the solution?
[2:44:57] Grimmzsix: the gameplay of PVP is goos in classic but the system is bad
[2:45:19] sheeeeszh: the solution is to remove the que as grp
[2:45:29] sheeeeszh: which will create a whole other fuzz
[2:45:42] jschroe3: Yeah that's what I meant
[2:46:00] reklebin: are you racing to 40?
[2:46:06] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: people queued as raid in AV back in SoM..just queue at the same time and join the same number AV. but you need insta pop for it to work
[2:46:10] Prowler1314: premades shouldnt even be a thing
[2:46:26] sheeeeszh: Just wanna see what gnomes will cook up with engi at 240
[2:46:31] ponyslayers: should allow 5man max i reckon
[2:46:36] miloxz: hopefully gnome is delayed a week to have time to explore the changes
[2:46:39] jschroe3: Yeah in my mind pugs should be prio to other pugs and premades should be prio to other premades
[2:46:42] rutzki: premade vs premade is fine
[2:46:44] Ilove_togetwet: Glad they will prob delay raid a week
[2:46:45] Grimmzsix: then just make RBGS in classic
[2:46:57] HurricaneWho: yeah if its premade vs premades everyone will still complain
[2:47:00] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: people will always find a way around to solve the problem to their advantage :)

[2:47:27] MisterThatDude: I feel like as soon as premades start mostly queuing into premades it will die out. I feel like a lot just enjoy the stomp
[2:47:28] Fhrostitute: damn
[2:47:30] Grimmzsix: thats sad
[2:47:37] Ilove_togetwet: SoD is not the end game
[2:47:40] Ilove_togetwet: its what comes next
[2:47:40] vepsee: wasnt the arena point icon datamined
[2:47:42] vepsee: or some shit
[2:47:43] Redgamer94: What if they make a premade que and just know it will take longer to que but give more honor since they would be harder
[2:47:46] aBradAbroad: creates expectations for balance that they dont want to be held to
[2:47:46] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: if you don't hit the witch, they dont freeze, fun fact
[2:47:47] IrisFromAlaska: arean kills wpvp
[2:47:58] xswamps: pug stomping gets boring af
[2:48:05] aBradAbroad: afk at enemy gy is not fun
[2:48:05] ins0mn: make losing not as punishing by providing higher reward for completing the bg ?
[2:48:08] Prowler1314: honestly only mad virgins like to "stomp" pugs
[2:48:11] pinochetsama01: Most premades are just to stomp and grind fastee
[2:48:16] KonQel: Wsup boys hope all is good today
[2:48:16] luzid7: what is fun about running 3 flags back and don#t fight lol
[2:48:51] miloxz: problem with premade vs premade is when one team just gives up when there's a slight disadvantage for them
[2:49:02] rutzki: sounds like going east in ashenvale
[2:49:04] Fierceee: Was that a Canadian accent
[2:49:24] epidemicttv: Is the 'give-up' method really a flaw in the game or the player base?
[2:49:58] luzid7: true
[2:50:05] high_ryy: Mounts will make it more enjoyable too
[2:50:09] Kormz__: i think most people would rather just get the bg done with quick and not actually fight it out
[2:50:12] luzid7: no jumps and shit you rly need to win fights
[2:50:21] jschroe3: God get me in those groups brother
[2:50:25] fdaapproved123: AB is alliance BG
[2:50:26] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: when you win a game with like 1500/1490 after  a  clutch cap, holy shit
[2:50:30] jschroe3: Sounds so fun
[2:50:34] Darkpain876: what's the next world pvp event gonna be at? Wetlands?

[2:50:50] Ilove_togetwet: 166 damage to beat

[2:50:55] Ilove_togetwet: LETS GO
[2:50:56] nixxor: Whats your AB strat
[2:50:56] Kormz__: close bg matches feel so much more rewarding
[2:50:56] Chipnizzle: hundreds of hours for a tabard that’s classic for ya
[2:51:00] evildufus: I like how you said snuggling all day was a waste of time but wow all day is gg lol
[2:51:04] SheepADeep: soniiDance soniiDance soniiDance soniiDance
[2:51:27] aBradAbroad: old DNB song
[2:51:27] epidemicttv: Premades vs PUGs is the reason I rerolled from ally to horde. Sitting in a 8 minute queue as a PUG to get stomped by a horde premade is demoralizing and a waste of time. There is zero fun that comes from it for I imagine both sides.
[2:51:35] shalomski: Done bfd 4 x on priest alt, got 4 items so far, 3 are not gr8 but 4th is staff lol
