[0:06:40] HeyImArty: Kek
[0:06:43] mightyx4444: i think cata will be fun and then it will feel like wrath/any other xpac in final season esp with pve gear stack
[0:08:13] yamzxc: some trinkets n shit
[0:08:13] Moobot: playlist !socialmedias !photosynthesis !covenant !legendaries !conduits !stats !discord !macros !ui !specs !restodruid !awc !armory
[0:08:16] mightyx4444: i remember rogues running 4p pve tier
[0:08:16] HeyImArty: S13 was a fair but, rogues ran dagges + trinket + 2set from raid
[0:08:26] HeyImArty: Rogue 2set from DS is 20% cheaper abilities for 8sec after Tricks
[0:08:27] mightyx4444: spriest would run 2p also
[0:08:30] HeyImArty: So you just use that for every dance
[0:08:35] reggieface420: the pve gear gets more and more difficult to get aswell i assume
[0:08:55] Tupacx: Hey pojke! Are you excited for Cata? Do you have class tips for me?
[0:09:05] Tupacx: Professions perhjaps?
[0:09:19] Tupacx: I am meming dw
[0:09:21] reggieface420: like in wotlk they started nerfing icc after 8 weeks in this version
[0:09:25] ludacris_xoxo: @Tupacx yo my man
[0:09:33] Tupacx: Yoo luda!
[0:09:43] yamzxc: bet theres announcement this week or next
[0:09:47] toothpickirl: Are your character named after Trille?
[0:09:57] utbiu: When Rasel?
[0:10:05] HeyImArty: @reggieface420 DS also had a increasing debuff
[0:10:08] HeyImArty: did people forget that
[0:10:09] reggieface420: icc got its buff after 8 weeks right
[0:10:12] HeyImArty: also cata pve is a joke
[0:10:23] reggieface420: it went to 5% hp/dmg after 8 weeks
[0:10:26] reggieface420: i didnt know that arty
[0:10:30] reggieface420: the same system?
[0:10:31] toothpickirl: Thougtt he was a töntingtönt :D haha
[0:10:44] Rivahlol: minWELCOME1 minWELCOME2 minWELCOME1 minWELCOME2
[0:10:48] ekunx: BatChest
[0:10:49] HeyImArty: @reggieface420 it's 5% less hp & dmg mobs rather than a 5% buff on players, increasing every X week
[0:10:52] mightyx4444: i asked like two weeks ago and i still dont know how to make it make sense with the letters but its TUN TER TUN ok guys
[0:10:53] HeyImArty: But yes, same concept

[0:15:28] dreamevil33: is it possible to come back to wotlk at this point for arena or gonna be unplayable?
[0:15:31] Ripper10: obviously @minpojke loves this game after spending 20 years on it
[0:16:13] ekunx: @dreamevil33 gear might be an issue, and if you do get gear you won't have a lot of playtime where you've got full gear before the season ends
[0:16:29] toothpickirl: Warriors usually have a lower IQ could be reason to the parries and dodges
[0:16:41] dreamevil33: oh ok
[0:16:49] dreamevil33: cata waiting room i guess
[0:16:53] Kishti: he is saying "LIKEAPRIEST"
[0:16:55] Kishti: not A PRIEST
[0:16:56] Kishti: hahaha
[0:17:02] yamzxc: hes saying likeapriest
[0:17:11] ekunx: @dreamevil33 if you're going to play cata anyway you can go for it
[0:17:17] Ripper10: but he has 10+ years experience of this exp and he doesn’t know the stats requirement minSAD
[0:17:26] reggieface420: no
[0:17:28] Kishti: I understood after the second time he said it
[0:17:29] Kishti: not the first
[0:17:31] Kishti: lmao
[0:17:33] Rivahlol: @dreamevil33 u can start making ur character and play a bit
[0:17:47] zafaiya: its the accent
[0:18:03] Rivahlol: go ditch shinta
[0:18:05] Rivahlol: and go
[0:18:10] its_creepx: I think shinta should try to attack from the back more, ferals do it and they're the most op class in wrath
[0:18:17] Kishti: his name "like a priest" doesnt help
[0:18:25] Rivahlol: i see how it is bro
[0:18:28] BroyWonder: i wonder how he would react against 10 miss sacred cleansing Kappa
[0:18:32] utbiu: Ditch Shinta for Rasel
[0:18:47] reggieface420: 8 hrs of wow into the gym
[0:19:01] Ripper10: into back to wow into sleep
[0:19:04] Ripper10: for 10 years
[0:19:10] Ripper10: that’s the play

[1:29:44] Turaxyy: Orman on his way to get 15k games s8

[1:30:01] fullonxd: hello
[1:30:06] fullonxd: any dp feral action today?
[1:30:12] hakunaxy: the game wasnt better just simply more people played the cheating ruined alot ..
[1:30:12] Badly216: mace stun and double dog with glaives was annoying but still better then wotlk
[1:30:22] Annagoeslive: but how do u get faster shadowmourne
[1:30:23] Annagoeslive: Hmmm
[1:30:32] Annagoeslive: or no pve gear
[1:30:33] Samzon_: im gay if that helps
[1:30:35] Urpalmax: just add wartorn items like on whitemane
[1:30:36] dogfotm: Make everything swipeable EZ fix Clap
[1:30:38] noopelol: Ye its like ppl want to comebacak but cant, they should uncap arena points or msthing

[1:31:50] hakunaxy: yeah if your new you need just 1 month then its fine its the hurdle of starting and not waiting and waiting you wont get magically gear..
[1:32:30] Annagoeslive: @hakunaxy 1month? u get wep+offhand :D
[1:33:16] nerdstomperxz: @hakunaxy just need 20 raid ids + loot council who likes u or swipe for enough gold, nice game SUBprise
[1:33:21] shucoco: Tbf blizzard did a lot to help the pvp,  they removed teams and allowed  cross server queues
[1:33:34] shucoco: People just got bored of the game i guess
[1:33:40] hakunaxy: You can farm full Honor Gear thats enaugh to get atleast 2.2k or 2k Rating in 4 Weeks you have atleast 5 Full Set or 4 Pieces + most Gear you can buy in GDKP anyways..
[1:33:50] miguel_perez_94: do you think mop classic will happen?
[1:34:05] Annagoeslive: @hakunaxy well yeah 2k rating
[1:34:10] Annagoeslive: but what is 2k
[1:34:14] Gatoradeshame: @Minpojke do you have any interest in rated bgs in cata?
[1:34:14] Annagoeslive: if people are 3.5
[1:34:18] Annagoeslive: 2k=1,2k~
[1:34:25] hakunaxy: I talk about a new Players thats not good you know what i mean some R1 will do everything faster ..
[1:34:37] shucoco: Well what should they do? Remove pve gear?
[1:34:38] hakunaxy: that are not"
[1:34:53] Annagoeslive: new players wont even get 2k in 3months, wotlk way to complex
[1:35:02] Ripper10: sod brings money
[1:35:16] Annagoeslive: new players will quit once they realize its 90% GDKP and they have to blast 200euro for first raid gold
[1:35:27] Ripper10: so true
[1:35:29] dogfotm: cata doesnt have gated gear does it
[1:35:31] dogfotm: only 2.2 wep
[1:35:39] shucoco: I think in cata theres a way to catchup
[1:35:40] Annagoeslive: @dogfotm s11 full pve trinkets/wep
[1:35:42] hakunaxy: yeah only weapon is better
[1:35:43] Annagoeslive: +2set pve
[1:35:45] natthamtarn: Make resilience scale better
[1:35:55] hakunaxy: but i mean cata is unbalanced as fck espacially in s11
[1:35:55] Moobot: www.Twitter.com/Minpojke_ & https://www.instagram.com/jonandersson92/ and https://discord.gg/STTWtwwDet
[1:35:56] zhooldan: i can already see the tentacles spawn
[1:35:58] dogfotm: A hard skip on s11 EZ
[1:35:59] miguel_perez_94: @dogfotm yes
[1:36:10] dogfotm: S9 gonna be fun i feel
[1:36:28] Badly216: pvp gear isnt itemized for pve, so even if they did that wouldnt harm pve
[1:36:32] Simmshady: wrath is by far the worst expac for being able to compete in pvp and by compete i mean playing high on the ladder. the time sink/gold sink for gear is insane
[1:36:34] Badly216: would just make it easier to gear alts if anything
[1:36:34] Eonx: Remember when they did that system initially and people figured out green gear scaled the best and absolutely banged everyone
[1:36:42] Badly216: would be a good change
[1:36:54] hakunaxy: idk if they changed alot from shadowlands but in shadowlands i tryd to play retail and it took so long with those stupid rng item drops from the ward..
[1:36:59] Annagoeslive: s9 is barely any pve, just warrior trinket that transform into a dragon and some other little things doesnt rly matter
[1:37:02] Eonx: I think so yea
[1:37:23] Mankz: They did give exp buff I'm leveling on wrath now with 50% more would have loved 100% tho
[1:37:42] hakunaxy: Mop had by far the best System in my Opinion..
[1:37:43] Tupacx: "compete" lets be real people use gear as an excuse but the fact is that 95% or more of the community wouldnt be able to compete in the first place even if handed every item
[1:37:49] freeletixs94: @annagoeslive y furynof Angerforge ... And u can buy it in Auctionhouse
[1:37:54] gobyeah: POJKE!!!!
[1:37:54] Badly216: im excited for cata pvp, never played it YEP
[1:38:01] hakunaxy: Cata is badass honestly
[1:38:05] Annagoeslive: @freeletixs94 yeah
[1:38:13] hakunaxy: realy great pvp expension just unbalanced xD but still alot of fun
[1:38:17] Annagoeslive: i want to see some double dk hpal in s9 Hmmm
[1:38:22] gobyeah: inte mycket, fixa nyss lite Karinas lasange ;D
[1:38:24] Badly216: true
[1:38:26] Annagoeslive: necrotic spam until unhealable
[1:38:28] nerdstomperxz: also since there is 0 esport in classic arenas the incentive to learn and tryhard it is pretty low
[1:38:35] Damagerx: lock with staff+ trinket and rogue with legendary is op in cata
[1:38:36] Badly216: Why do something to wotlk rn when sod is a thing
[1:38:38] luunomxd: sadge
[1:38:58] Badly216: #somechanges maybe in cata lol
[1:38:59] balofowow: they quite literally dont care about pvp
[1:39:04] Kinkkonkor: Kinkkonkor watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! wrath dead?
[1:39:16] Ripper10: but wouldn’t it be then meta too go with the releases
[1:39:25] hakunaxy: people play in wotlk since classic its there account and its worth something and its fun..
[1:39:28] Ripper10: Whats wrong
[1:39:33] Ripper10: with dat
[1:39:39] Kinkkonkor: what is good Cata private server i can fool around for a bit?
[1:39:51] xeenmannen: wrong tho. Pvp would become so big if they actually care about it

[1:41:27] luunomxd: Listen to pojke he got ATLEAST 4 years played time
[1:41:37] hakunaxy: idk what it is tho prob a mix of its to hard for some it takes to much time to farm stuff yeah..
[1:42:10] balofowow: @hakunaxy we have had wow for 15 years and pvp was never big always was at the biggest 5% of the pop

[1:42:17] 1700_IRL: if you look at the gaming genre as a whole all the biggest games are PvP with ladder/ranked systems, blizzard are just dog shit at their jobs
[1:42:40] hakunaxy: i dont think its true i play since 2008 i think something like that i went tru full wotlk-cata and back then it was insane
[1:42:47] Ex_z: Lmao
[1:43:01] Badly216: what ads EZ
[1:43:14] balofowow: @hakunaxy wow was the biggest game in the world back in original wrath thats why u think pvp was big, but it was still the smallest part of wow
[1:43:24] hakunaxy: you had just idfk 1000 of people infront of the citys you had insta ques guys like braindeadly made 1.5 2 million views in 24 hours it was going great..
[1:43:51] balofowow: that was only the case because wow had 10 million+ active players
[1:43:52] Ezzx: yeah peaked 12 mil subs in wotlk OG, 5% would be 600k active pvpers, thats more then entire wotlk classic population worldwide and then some
[1:43:52] Ripper10: and what happened then bro
[1:44:09] Annagoeslive: you cant replicate sucess over and over
[1:44:15] Annagoeslive: there is just a certain amount of good ideas
[1:44:31] balofowow: the percentage of pvpers never went up only down
[1:44:47] hakunaxy: i mean i go by the numbers of of youtube and the biggest guys back then they had insane viewer numbers even streaming they had 4-5k viewers and not on twitch just random pages..
[1:45:13] Annagoeslive: in cataclysm barely anyone had viewers even mop start 1k viewers was alot, only person with 5k viewers was reckful no?
[1:45:22] hakunaxy: @Annagoeslive  yeah sadly i was hoping they could but it just didnt hit the same ..
[1:45:31] Annagoeslive: xfire end / twitch start
[1:45:32] balofowow: i dont think u understand wow as a whole was alot alot bigger than now hence more people in pvp and interest in wow
[1:45:43] hakunaxy: Na in Cata Braindeadly,Athene,Jimos etc had 5-6k Viewers on Athenes Page..
[1:45:47] Ezzx: Streaming was kinda new back then also, xfire and justintv days
[1:46:11] hakunaxy: @Ezzx  exactly it wasnt that big and they still crushed the numbers because pvp was big back then..
[1:46:30] Ezzx: it was relatively big as the entire population was 20-30x current
[1:46:32] Annagoeslive: @hakunaxy thats like the  check-pvp guy he has 50 normal viewers and 700 because of the plugin of the website ?
[1:46:33] balofowow: @hakunaxy wow was big not pvp, the only reason is because wow was so huge
[1:47:12] balofowow: we prob dont have 1/10 of the active players wow had in 2010
[1:47:23] Annagoeslive: so anyone who gets linked on mainpage has automatically the viewers, you can put pojke on checkpvp fontpage thing where the french guy is and pojke has automatically 500+ viewers that are not here just on checkpvp
[1:47:29] hakunaxy: @Annagoeslive  Nah i dont believe they faked there Numbers you could just see they had tons of Views on Youtube aswell..
[1:47:37] Annagoeslive: @hakunaxy its not fake viewers
[1:47:48] Annagoeslive: its people with the page open and the stream "embed"
[1:48:06] hakunaxy: it was the same like twitch no difference
[1:48:18] hakunaxy: had your own channel chat etc..
[1:48:18] Moobot: www.Twitter.com/Minpojke_ & https://www.instagram.com/jonandersson92/ and https://discord.gg/STTWtwwDet
[1:48:43] Annagoeslive: @hakunaxy check haynetv, hes embed on "check pvp" he has 106 "chatters" real viewers and 500-600 viewer count because he is "embed"
[1:48:57] FERALMODE: pvp needs to somehow be made WAY more accessible for new players. especially players brand new to wow. otherwise it will just keep declining until its inevitable death. but theres no chance blizzard will put in the work :(
[1:49:28] hakunaxy: dont get what you mean with embed i just know they had real numbers because you could see the interaction in chat
[1:49:30] gibor_wow: @FERALMODE cata should be more easy, almost no need to do pve for gear
[1:49:44] hakunaxy: You could barly read any Message it was just full ..
[1:49:48] Annagoeslive: @hakunaxy ofc htey have alot chatting
[1:49:54] Annagoeslive: il test if i can link here
[1:49:57] hakunaxy: what ever ^^

[1:50:01] Annagoeslive: check this screenshot
[1:50:14] Annagoeslive: 505* but only 106 "chatters logged in twitch"
[1:50:26] Annagoeslive: 400 other are "embed" by a website (check-pvp) because he is on the front page
[1:50:57] Annagoeslive: so if i was to stream in cooperation with athene, "embed" on his website i had 2-3k viewers by default to start with
[1:51:12] hakunaxy: yeah obviously there are people who fake stuff still doesnt prove that they did it..

[1:51:21] Annagoeslive: its just embedding something
[1:51:45] hakunaxy: yeah with fke i mean it shows a number wrong to the actually viewer count ..
[1:51:58] Annagoeslive: twitch is gonna remove this at some point they said
[1:52:48] gobyeah: har du 2x hpal Pojke?
[1:54:02] Badly216: he had it Alot
[1:54:12] Annagoeslive: @hakunaxy check dm i show u

[2:01:47] hakunaxy: yeah some names i never forgett there just burned into my memory dont know why ^^
[2:02:03] Ex_z: He's complain either way tbh
[2:02:50] Annagoeslive: not even sure if private server is same as the cata we are gonna get released
[2:02:57] Pozzel2: Cata Beta will drop eventually too
[2:02:57] Annagoeslive: if on the same patch or so on
[2:03:08] Annagoeslive: like tbc rogues vanish was not the same as back then etc
[2:03:31] Pozzel2: No avi complains because He plays rogue and Hunters absolutely counter rogues....
[2:03:37] FERALMODE: i mean most good private servers are pretty close. and most are running the final patch, which is what blizz has done for every iteration of classic so far. no?
[2:03:51] BeastAFTV: tbc came and went and minpoke hasnt left nagrand
[2:04:40] fitzgeraldn: what if they get used to some bugged Pserver and then get their muscle memory fucked for classic cata
[2:05:09] Kalliala: Hey buddy @minpojke 😀
[2:05:23] hakunaxy: cata isnt that huge of a difference its pretty much the same all seasons its just small things..
[2:05:35] xarlivenow: muscle memory pet dismiss
[2:05:38] Eonx: can't wait for people to have scripts that kill spirit link totem before it's even ticked
[2:05:44] xarlivenow: once they fix it u will hunters dismissing nothing
[2:05:45] nerdstomperxz: curious to see if we getting ring of valor arena this time :)
[2:05:49] xarlivenow: see*
[2:05:58] hakunaxy: hope the cheating and scripting wont be a thing again that shit is annoying..
[2:06:10] notmorbos: @hakunaxy COPIUM
[2:06:17] pvelordtv: rasel said he will make sure they change ros!!

[2:07:20] notmorbos: @hakunaxy theres not a shred of doubt in my mind that the cheats are coming... the only question is if blizz will do smth about it
[2:07:28] notmorbos: and we know how good they are with that...
[2:08:29] Pozzel2: @xarlivenow ele will still be Ass in cata.
[2:08:35] xarlivenow: i know

[2:10:58] Pozzel2: Yeah but xar needs the Illusion that If Hunter loses pet dismiss, its His time to Shine. So swapping to rsham would destroy that

[2:12:08] xarlivenow: its just stupid to have it in the game
[2:12:33] roarby: what's your opinion on wotlk so far? Did it live to its hype or its meh?

[2:13:18] xeenmannen: it sux that its 2s bracket
[2:13:19] Pozzel2: I think the Game will get even worse. Firemages, rogues and ferals all rely on crit. Those classes are already the best classes outside of Hunter. So with ros gone thats all u gonna see
[2:13:27] Freskah: mop solidified as best xpac after seeing wotlk
[2:13:32] Freskah: but i think the players ruined wotlk too
[2:13:40] Tupacx: Yh keep pet swapping in game, it's the only thing u gotta use ur head for in cata anyway
[2:13:41] Annagoeslive: overhyped still better then dragonflight EleGiggle
[2:13:55] oakenn4: The best pvp was tlk private serv with only 264 item
[2:14:01] michael_jordan_cleave: Don't you think people played more tbc and vanilla pservers?
[2:14:07] Annagoeslive: :D
[2:14:08] hakunaxy: I dont know i feel like some People think its not a legit Game to put Time in wierd to Explaine.. For them Retail is WoW everything else is just nothing serious..
[2:14:13] Pozzel2: @tupacx agree
[2:14:25] mtexvlrt: Was it panda patch, or cata where u gained arena points after each win?
[2:14:55] hakunaxy: @mtexvlrt  nothing of those expension happens in legion the first time i think..
[2:15:00] Kalliala: Ah i was just in 8ads idk u answered but if u did can u say again pls 😅
[2:15:12] pvelordtv: @Pozzel2 or just get pyro on first cast :D

[4:15:38] allelolxd: @beaniex12 Dont quote me on the time exactly and i dont really know how they meassure it around the world but from what i remember reading 21-22 is best time to go to sleep.  Some really weird stuff happens when you stay awake longer than you should.
[4:16:05] arenasheep: do u still wake up whit a boner
[4:16:05] Urpalmax: @Rivahlol this is a close 2nd https://www.twitch.tv/rivahlol/clip/AttractiveSwissBeeWholeWheat-KEY1WkjFyd-6c5BY

[4:16:29] Urpalmax: de nados are doing like ping pong wit me
[4:16:47] Rivahlol: @Urpalmax true
[4:16:53] beaniex12: @allelolxd nothing happens, it's just an average, your body doesn't know what time of day it is, thats a societal concept, it just cares that it gets enough
[4:17:36] Khagoran: hey. does someone has problems with logging in as well?
[4:17:36] beaniex12: of course 'on average' going to bed after 10 pm would mean less sleep because people have to be up early for work on average
[4:17:41] allelolxd: Wait, are you saying that our body does not have a circadian rhythm?
[4:18:27] Urpalmax: circadian rhythms can be individual and vary significantly among different people, no?
[4:18:32] Bloodx: ADIEU
[4:18:33] allelolxd: Sleeping while its light out is bad, being awake while its dark is bad.
[4:18:34] beaniex12: not much these days considering we have ways to reduce light lol
[4:18:36] Bloodx: XD
[4:18:47] beaniex12: bro have u heard of curtains
[4:18:47] Moobot: playlist !socialmedias !photosynthesis !covenant !legendaries !conduits !stats !discord !macros !ui !specs !restodruid !awc !armory
[4:19:04] allelolxd: Alright i dont know enough but im fairly certain you cannot trick the body long term with lights and curtains
[4:19:19] allelolxd: And i bet science adjusts for that in their study
[4:19:23] Urpalmax: "Variations in circadian rhythms can lead to different chronotypes, meaning some people are naturally morning types (larks), others are evening types (owls), and many fall somewhere in between. Genetic, environmental, and age-related factors contribute to these individual differences. Additionally, exposure to light, work schedules, and lifestyle choices can also influence one's circadian rhythms."
[4:20:39] allelolxd: Exact sleeping times will vary between people, but for the majority, the best quality of sleep is achieved at night, going to sleep between 10 p.m. to midnight and waking around 7 a.m. Many people need to go to sleep earlier; a few natural “night owls”can go to sleep a little later
