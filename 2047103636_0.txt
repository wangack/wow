[5:44:32] SharmaJenkins: yeah, mass invi is grief
[5:44:38] hollow1zed: you dont need the boxes cuz you are gonna craft the chest and everything else is cheap
[5:45:12] SharmaJenkins: either is fine
[5:45:17] hollow1zed: you already have the free token
[5:45:31] SharmaJenkins: crafted has more haste, less versa
[5:45:37] ImShmoly: you can craft one for 2nd embelilishment, doesnt matter
[5:45:39] melvinguyy: best music on twitch
[5:45:41] adjective96: 2v1 for sure

[5:46:06] SharmaJenkins: it's catchup
[5:46:09] SharmaJenkins: you will get more
[5:46:09] majkteh: catchup mechanics
[5:46:15] Ajimoto93: I love classic and OD. But retail PvP hits different.
[5:46:22] mrciannu: u now queing shuffle?
[5:46:24] mrciannu: not
[5:46:30] SharmaJenkins: he is
[5:46:30] majkteh: u will catchup till 6.5 sparks i think
[5:47:07] hollow1zed: you already have the free token @Ziqoftw
[5:47:07] ImShmoly: several mages run crafted chest
[5:47:18] shoeloopz: if you craft it then the stats are 50/50 instead of 30/70
[5:47:23] ImShmoly: you can craft ring as well afterwards without embellishment
[5:47:25] SharmaJenkins: yes
[5:47:26] hollow1zed: yeah
[5:47:26] HarshSynthTV: dust to dust
[5:47:34] DeityRevert: crafteed chest is free cause of those free tokens
[5:47:34] SharmaJenkins: exactly
[5:47:37] mrciannu: are u queing shuffle or just skirmish?
[5:47:46] jshim: naw
[5:47:50] jshim: you still need to buy the trophy
[5:47:53] jdsauza: crafting pieces of gear just allows you to adjust secondary stats more
[5:47:54] ImShmoly: u can get like 6 sparks, can craft chest, ring whatever u want
[5:47:54] jshim: so its same cost
[5:48:01] Lythi: yoyo Ziqo! hope you´re doing well dude
[5:48:02] jdsauza: lets you have more of another stat
[5:48:05] DeityRevert: can put a random secondary stat embelishment on too. adds up
[5:48:19] Lythi: doing great bro, super tired after work LUL
[5:48:38] jdsauza: like instead of 1000 vers and 500 haste its 750 of each
[5:48:39] ImShmoly: check raikus armory, he has crafted chest, boots and 2 rings
[5:48:40] hollow1zed: i think you eventually have crafted rings/neck/boots and belt
[5:48:41] jshim: its just even distribution of stats instead of heavy vers like the pvp gear but you still need conquest to buy the trophy regardless so it costs the same
[5:48:41] jdsauza: so more of wtv stat you want
[5:48:54] DeityRevert: verdent conduit is an embelishment. you would put it on chest. gives secondary stat procs
[5:49:01] jshim: ya its the free one from the quest
[5:49:17] SharmaJenkins: verdant conduit is not worth it
[5:49:31] hollow1zed: you cant make crafted items into set pieces
[5:49:32] DeityRevert: nothing else better
[5:49:48] SharmaJenkins: there is, belt is better
[5:49:56] DeityRevert: then you lose more haste
[5:50:02] ImShmoly: check Raikus armory, hes running 5 crafted items
[5:50:04] ggorbaz: did you saw some pvp streamers model scripting without getting ban? is it fine with blizzard rules?

[5:52:23] hollow1zed: its not bad until you catch up
[5:52:30] hollow1zed: there is a cap on them
[5:52:30] ImShmoly: its pretty good, you'll have 6 soon or whatever cap is rn

[5:55:06] LHermite: how are soloshuffle Qs atm?
[5:55:06] Amexx1: do you need gear to jump into soloQ?
[5:55:11] Bushido288: Time to grief

[5:55:33] Zanrill: no boosts tho

[5:55:57] Zanrill: a week of gametime?
[5:56:14] hulkdieselx: youre in full honor gear and fairly competative day 1
[5:56:30] hulkdieselx: another couple queue sessions to fill out conquest gear
[5:56:39] schdenfreude: @zanrill 1-2 days for leveling and one for gearing full honor gear by spamming bgs
[5:56:54] SharmaJenkins: real time
