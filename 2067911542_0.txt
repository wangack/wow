[2:00:05] LordBambii: all melee is mid except melee hunters
[2:00:07] Unframed_: melee hunters outperforming the pure melee class YEP
[2:00:07] MrSlyth: Survival hunters on top!
[2:00:08] LordBambii: interesting
[2:00:13] bangbangdeveloper: ye but bro they have to haaaardcast it
[2:00:23] Porkypine666: melee hunter does not deserve a buff, let them have some fun for one phase lol
[2:00:24] Wooshu: Why would they nerf melee hunter.. the most immobile class.. if a Hunter gets the drop on you you deserve to die
[2:00:28] Indomitablez: @wannabes94 https://wago.io/DebuffsOnNameplates/2
[2:00:34] MrSlyth: I main Hunter. About time Hunters are relevent

[2:00:59] charbosan: shamans and locks are better tanks than warrs too lol
[2:01:11] Unframed_: thats an L take ICANT
[2:01:13] MrSlyth: As a hunter its kind of hard esp melee
[2:01:14] fallen1881: @MrSlyth Main'd hunter since vanilla. I dont like the melee
[2:01:18] Wooshu: @ziiakk_ melee hunter is, you pop cheetah, u get hit slow. u use concussive shot and people still can kite you
[2:01:24] vepsee: cant you still use normal hunter cc shit even as a melee hunter
[2:01:28] MrSlyth: @MrSlyth Ive learned to love it but its so nice
[2:01:31] Selecktt: Yeah that makes sense. Unless you're a fucking WARRIOR. Wtf are you going to do? Kite the melee hunter? Plink em with the gat?
[2:01:33] Wooshu: you can try and nail a trap launcer
[2:01:35] Iol69: warriors been on top in classic for 15 years and hunters only invited for tranq shot
[2:01:41] Wooshu: the melee hunter has no good gap closer
[2:01:42] rah_sheed: you cant be suggesting a wrrior should kite a melee hunter
[2:01:46] Iol69: turns have tabled

[2:04:27] Selecktt: @xtoady420 rogue 100%. You will not be having a good time as warrior right now.
[2:04:29] charbosan: pretty sure in one of the sod interviews it was said that the devs want everyone to have fun not "just" warriros
[2:04:31] Wolfatoms: @xtoady420 100% rogue lol not even close
[2:04:50] Iol69: @charbosan rogues had fun too sometimes!

[2:05:14] gremell: no
[2:05:14] Indomitablez: nope
[2:05:16] charbosan: @Iol69 that's prob why warr feels underserved
[2:05:19] gremell: prolly eng or gnomer toy
[2:05:19] taco_rob: at like 44
[2:05:25] Dimichsky: gnomer toy

[2:05:37] jaxismynam3: what addon makes you look like you have rank 14 gear??
[2:05:49] TheBubbaj: whats the addon that shows debuffs above their hp bar
[2:06:19] Crazia: Wonder if anyone will kill that boss at some point
[2:06:40] nofrontin: everyone was oom
[2:06:40] Wooshu: I wish we could see enemy life rather than just a percentage
[2:06:58] Wooshu: enemy player*
[2:07:35] LordBambii: @Crazia is there a blod reward for killing it
[2:07:50] MrSlyth: I prefer percentages
[2:07:57] jaxismynam3: thank you sir
[2:07:59] Crazia: i have no idea
[2:08:20] Crazia: but it would be cool ^^
[2:08:32] LordBambii: as they should
[2:08:33] MrSlyth: Thats the goal take out healers first
[2:08:37] Wooshu: I dont think anyone could kill the STV world boss yet
[2:08:44] Wooshu: Hes pretty much a one shot
[2:08:58] Crazia: Bring 200 ppl
[2:09:08] LordRamAssington: hes there to give the blood buff
[2:09:11] Wooshu: If he kills u in 1 shot u cant tank him.. I guess 50 Hunters kiting him?
[2:09:24] yarrpeter: soniiWave
[2:09:36] MrSlyth: 50 hunters kiting and 50 people willing to sacrifice themself
[2:09:50] Crazia: Did anyone kill Omen yet ? it can be summoned at lvl 40 right ?
[2:09:52] yarrpeter: Not much you gonna shave your head too?

[2:12:30] celestialkaneki: But it's good lol
[2:12:39] Crazia: I like Melee hunter, but its to OP and too easy
[2:12:39] Wooshu: Fury gonna be BIS in P3
[2:13:02] celestialkaneki: It might be but I'm 100% sure they are tryna change the 20 warriors in Mc at 60
[2:13:11] thisisnotanick: need headbanging emote
[2:13:17] radassbadass69: @Wooshu nah fury needs impale with level 60 talent pts
[2:13:21] nerdymaestro: this event is bad as a warrior without support
[2:13:32] Shepp22: waylay super good too. daze spec rogues
[2:13:33] celestialkaneki: This event is bad period without healers
[2:13:48] thundercawp: i just cant see how bliz can justify making melee hunters so strong, they are like a world buffed warrior and hunter combined

[2:15:11] thundercawp: i just cant see how bliz can justify making melee hunters so strong, they are like a world buffed warrior and hunter combined
[2:15:20] miloxz: @SONII what do you think of my idea: Warriors in P3 should get runes to have their ranged weapons be viable. If hunters can be better melee dps, warriors should be better better ranged dps
[2:15:21] pyk239: Whats the Addon that shows debuffs on enemy playes?
[2:15:35] Shepp22: anyone have AGM yet?

[2:16:05] celestialkaneki: What sever u on ?
[2:16:08] Sanitygodx: most hunters i know dont want melee hunter to be good, they play hunter to be a ranged archer
[2:16:10] pyk239: Whats the Addon that shows debuffs on enemy playes?
[2:16:11] Brosie1987: they should make a Berserker class, some Axe throwing BADASS xD
[2:16:15] itsmistero: omg this song
[2:16:21] Blinkangels182: The Used?? Let's GO!!
[2:16:21] celestialkaneki: @sanitygodx I'm a hunter and I hate mele

[2:16:25] WilesDS: how many coins u get
[2:16:30] celestialkaneki: But I still use it for pvp
[2:16:30] Fierceee: @Sanitygodx That's me
[2:16:31] MrSlyth: Um false
[2:16:33] celestialkaneki: Because it's broken
[2:16:35] celestialkaneki: Broken
[2:16:36] MrSlyth: I play melee
[2:16:38] juice42069: i got 800 coins from that event
[2:16:42] BroccoliTom: people just annoying me today.  THREE times today people asked me mid heavy set if someone was using something. like BRO IDK FUCK OFF MY HEADS TURNING RED
[2:16:43] pyk239: !addon
[2:16:43] kyidentity: they want to play it because its op
[2:16:46] celestialkaneki: U play mele be
[2:16:47] Juffrey: i am a hunter and I love melee hunter
[2:16:48] Crazia: I do ^^
[2:17:00] MrSlyth: I even play survival in retail
[2:17:01] WilesDS: SONII COIN CHECK
[2:17:03] caravainilla: @celestialkaneki You literally said you were having fun as melee hunter earlier.
[2:17:08] pew2700: This song is such a damn jam.  Fucking memories
[2:17:12] celestialkaneki: I am in pvp
[2:17:13] BroccoliTom: it takes a special kinda dumb to ask people mid set about some other shit....
[2:17:13] WilesDS: how many u get last run
[2:17:13] celestialkaneki: That's it
[2:17:15] celestialkaneki: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:17:20] applesauce399: i play sv in retail so im happy its good but scared to touch for now bc its strong
[2:17:31] Crazia: never too late bro
[2:17:35] celestialkaneki: Pvp is fun as a mele hunter pve not imo
[2:17:49] Wooshu: I didnt know melee Hunters were such a problem. Ive had no problem kiting them as a Boomkin. I could see them being a problem if I was Feral
[2:17:54] mitchp333: warriors got reduced to mainly dps
[2:17:55] kyidentity: there should be barbarian warriors
[2:18:01] domehxy: Support Warrior with MOP flaggs :D
[2:18:02] Crazia: Theyre gonna cook some sick runes for p3 #believe
[2:18:02] caravainilla: gladiator stance
[2:18:04] pew2700: pvp as melee hunter just ruins what makes vanilla hunter great and thats playing the deadzone
[2:18:05] whinck: hows your gear looking soni?
[2:18:12] Selecktt: Giving us more rage would solve many things.
[2:18:15] BroccoliTom: warrior with fire spells. like a vindicator
[2:18:18] Maybe_Canadian: blademaster, mirror image
[2:18:20] justjcherry: ranged warrior lmao
[2:18:28] BroccoliTom: leaves fire trails, whirlwind splahes fire dot
[2:18:29] Greekology: Rage gen and freedom would b nice
[2:18:30] pyk239: Whats the Addon that shows debuffs on enemy playes?
[2:18:31] Nyt_Ram: Add a rune that makes you deal more damage the less heavy your armor is
[2:18:31] ziiakk_: guild wars 2 has some good warrior sub calsses
[2:18:31] cleannjerkk: like throwing weapon
[2:18:35] MrSlyth: @pew2700 well thankfully this isnt vanilla
[2:18:38] ziiakk_: classes*
[2:18:38] Unframed_: I honestly believe endless rage doesnt work
[2:18:39] WilesDS: how many coins did u get from that stv sonii
[2:18:40] pyk239: Whats the Addon that shows debuffs on enemy name plates?
[2:18:45] jellymann: i feel the simplicity of warrior is what makes it the best class imo - charge in start swinging
[2:18:54] juice42069: how u got so much stam
[2:18:54] Wooshu: "Leeching Strikes"
[2:18:56] NawtyTyme: pre freaking out
[2:18:58] BroccoliTom: im freaking out #nochanges
[2:19:10] caravainilla: ok fuck off LUL
[2:19:17] Brosie1987: AMS 45 sec xDDD
[2:19:23] Greekology: ya im down
[2:19:24] Greekology: LOL
[2:19:26] MrSlyth: Now you are asking to much
[2:19:27] gen7lem4n: soniiYo
[2:19:27] Nightbot: soniiYo
[2:19:34] pew2700: @MrSlyth Def not thankfully lol.  And outside of the runes its still classic/vanilla, and being able to play the deadzone successfully is what separates a good hunter from a bad one
[2:19:35] NawtyTyme: u also want a new born baby?
[2:19:35] doylactus: ams full magic nullify?
[2:19:36] radassbadass69: 100% over 7 seconds LUL
[2:19:37] kraztez: so basically, make them death knights
[2:19:39] doylactus: then 8 s
[2:19:39] WilesDS: can i get a quick coin check sonii
[2:19:41] CaptKeyser: would see shockwave before spear honestly
[2:19:42] Selecktt: Legion iteration of bloodthirst would be nice. Generates 8 rage rather than costing it.
[2:19:42] WilesDS: from that last run
[2:19:46] mynde01: Do you have a job
[2:19:48] WilesDS: i wanna know how much u made from pwning us
[2:19:50] Wooshu: Retail Warrior is so damn good
[2:19:51] BroccoliTom: i dream about ways to trigger warrior talks every night
[2:19:53] takethattakethat: Cheer100 what was a concert you attended that exceeded your expectations. or the opposite, the worst  concert you attended? and explain why. happy Monday stud.
[2:20:01] Jonathan_4567: honestly just making it so CBR is strong and giving us enough rage gen is enough.. the mini game of balancing around 80rage was a nice spin without completely changing the class in a weidr way
[2:20:05] Wooshu: Retail Warrior and their heals are pretty good
[2:20:28] pyk239: Whats the Addon that shows debuffs on enemy playes?
[2:20:43] radassbadass69: @pyk239 bigdebuffs
[2:20:49] pyk239: Thanks
[2:21:02] Winttyrr: man, A7X used to be SO damn good
[2:21:21] Selecktt: @Jonathan_4567 yeah but the cbr rotation wasnt really any different than the normal rotation. We held at 50 rage anyway in the normal rotation. changing it from 50 to 80 wasnt much different.
[2:21:38] Wooshu: Yeah is Impending the Warrior heal on a 6sec CD?
[2:21:47] cleannjerkk: Woltk paly
[2:21:50] CaptKeyser: they should just give titan's grip to hunter at this point. best melee dps
[2:21:50] doylactus: RIP
[2:21:54] HpainGU: What weapon are you using ?
[2:21:55] juice42069: how do u fix stv res buff without hitting spirit healer
[2:21:56] CaptKeyser: totally sarcastic with that btw
[2:22:03] WilesDS: lmfao what was that flag cap
[2:22:03] juice42069: bug*
[2:22:09] WilesDS: why is every1 sittin there bro XDD
[2:22:33] Jonathan_4567: @Selecktt Yeah no I agree, I'm just giving a  morerealistic fix that could be done now to make the class more fun than current
[2:22:43] WilesDS: soniidigital is your name based off the rap producer sonii digital
[2:22:47] EmpurityTV: blizzard just give us fucking bladestorm for cc break
[2:22:53] pew2700: Make bloodthirst baseline with a heal effect
[2:22:56] BroccoliTom: they shouldve given warrior like a "tower shield charge"

[3:17:41] sawyerou: even if its only 10 gold
[3:17:44] thisisnotanick: need an in game gold laundry operation

[3:18:37] TuvaIaTimmy: no supporting bots 💢
[3:18:37] fourkgaming: bought on different bnet pre p2
[3:18:39] Ashlikesnows: KEKW of course he did
[3:18:42] Wooshu: Ahmpy had 3k gold a few days ago
[3:18:42] WilesDS: mage frming or buying gold
[3:18:44] usualtwitcher: im having a blast this phase, maybe cauz im a shadowpriest
[3:18:46] WilesDS: 1 of 2 ways
[3:18:47] vepsee: its crazy how normalized gold buying is now
[3:18:47] WilesDS: XD
[3:18:48] vepsee: lmao
[3:18:49] miloxz: no need to buy gold, I just made 66g selling the gnomer grime encrusted salvage
[3:18:53] Ashlikesnows: @fourkgaming EZ Clap
[3:18:55] vepsee: "yeah bro I bought like 15k nbd"
[3:19:01] WilesDS: mage farming is just farming gold off gold buyers tbh
[3:19:03] WilesDS: as a mage
[3:19:15] yarrpeter: Back in my day, we farmed our gold
[3:19:15] vepsee: @WilesDS wonder what gdkps were for
[3:19:16] ogMansoN: dude im going to be mass reporting people from now on if they get banned for 7 days
[3:19:18] brownfiesta: @Tangents92 yeh its a painful grind
[3:19:26] fourkgaming: @vepsee 30+ yr old men dont really want to spend their freetime farming gold
[3:19:26] WilesDS: hahhaha same thing i imagine @vepsee
[3:19:31] usualtwitcher: my buddy made over 1k just with stockade boost alone
[3:19:37] WilesDS: no they i farm them of fit :(
[3:19:54] Tangents92: @brownfiesta It really is. I regret not finishing last phase. Good thing i was more than half way to exalted tho. I need 3.5k rn
[3:19:58] vepsee: @fourkgaming yea im just saying its funny since most people hate it but still do it
[3:20:36] fookinrick: 2hrs left on my 2 week ban for getting gold sent to me from a random person.
[3:20:55] thisisnotanick: wow should do like eve online and sell in game items that gives you 30 day sub, would kill most of the external site gold selling
[3:20:58] Wooshu: If you ran GDKP, 5k gold isnt out of the realm of impossible
[3:21:02] danthemann54: how much gold you got total @SONII
[3:21:14] OneAndOnlyStony: 100
[3:21:17] sanctizzle: So glad GDKPs are banned
[3:21:17] Jaymundoz: solo queues kinda slow rn

[3:22:06] Sways22: so u buy more gold
[3:22:07] yarrpeter: First corona now gdkps
[3:22:09] SurrealAndre: so they caused the problem to create a solution and made money off it, big brain
[3:22:10] Wooshu: GDKP just sounds like an abbreviation out of communist china
[3:22:17] thisisnotanick: berticussHeadbang berticussHeadbang berticussHeadbang berticussHeadbang
[3:22:19] logic__: no wonder china has so many botters, they created GDKP's lmfao

[3:25:15] lampsterof79: NO SAMPSON
[3:25:15] yarrpeter: LETS GO! I just donated 14 in

[3:25:43] Selecktt: Selecktt gifted a Tier 1 sub to vepsee! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[3:25:50] vepsee: @Selecktt Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:25:55] julionowis: What rank flash heal u using?
[3:25:58] vepsee: Adge
[3:25:59] yarrpeter: Donated 14 in and now im bald OMEGALUL
[3:26:02] Slaughter13x: Does he love WoW and PC
[3:26:06] thisisnotanick: why are you cutting it?
[3:26:16] Wooshu: long hair is maintence
[3:26:16] ogMansoN: #freebubonics
[3:26:23] ogMansoN: we need tshirts boys
[3:26:23] citrci101: Do you think its too late start SoD from 0 if i didnt liked my class?
[3:26:27] Wahabao: how u manage being so lean
[3:26:33] vepsee: @citrci101 not at all
[3:26:34] OneAndOnlyStony: I miss my long hair. Now im old and cant.
[3:26:38] Andrettiixd: Xaryu just got a haircut too
[3:26:39] vepsee: I mean yes
[3:26:42] Wooshu: kekw
[3:26:43] yarrpeter: No way. They added that xp buff
[3:26:48] dirtxnap: 1 to  25 had a xp boost
[3:26:50] Empire_OCE: You can lvl a class to 40 in 35 hours
[3:26:51] Lannakzach: @citrci101 can hit 40 in the time it took to type that sentence
[3:26:52] Empire_OCE: Get in the game
[3:26:58] vepsee: we got like 2 months left of p2
[3:26:59] reefo: i started rogue on tuesday and i'm already WSG honored, 5/6 gnomer, and 2 BFD lockouts. never too late
[3:27:04] vepsee: 3 day lockouts start this week
[3:27:11] DeadSeaGiant: started leveling a rogue 2 days ago and now i'm at 23 already
[3:27:18] Selecktt: @citrci101 Sonii has to restart because he doesnt like his class either soniiLUL
[3:27:19] OneAndOnlyStony: @SONII bit of both
[3:27:26] Wooshu: dying your hair what color?
[3:27:28] Dracksar: hell yeah sonii bringing it back
[3:27:29] Grave09: bald soon
[3:27:29] yarrpeter: Everyone keeps telling me i look alot younger. I went blonde lol

[3:27:38] yarrpeter: YEP
[3:27:39] jamie7862: Oh okay
[3:27:41] Wooshu: Soniibald
[3:27:43] Vitticus: you doing it yourself or having a stylist do it?
[3:27:54] yarrpeter: Shaved my head and went blonde. On my frank ocean shit
[3:28:02] Denat0: damn bro you gotta stream whenever you finish the hair
[3:28:09] Wooshu: tape the handheld mirror to the mirror when u cut your hair
[3:28:10] thisisnotanick: i would watch that
[3:28:10] Trickster10162021: @SONII with the jokes tonight lol
[3:28:21] vepsee: bought scissors? not using the 20 year old arts and crafts scissors you find in the garage?
[3:28:24] yarrpeter: smart

[3:29:02] Selecktt: But for some reason he is hitting for 1100 white hits where I can only get 700. not sure why,
[3:29:05] Dracksar: HALP xaxS
[3:29:12] dirtxnap: 5  cruelty and go up to five in  axe skill
[3:29:13] OneAndOnlyStony: I mean when a guild is based around boosting your dps his build will probably be different.
[3:29:22] vepsee: he is but he plays all the meta shit, he also says war blows

[3:29:32] Mehmehran: he says Aggrend told him to reroll
[3:29:34] don_kneee: he says reroll hunter
[3:29:37] MrSlyth: what I miss
[3:29:43] jakedamus1024: I went arms and 5cruelty
[3:29:48] ryl24: he says reroll
[3:29:51] Tangents92: How does Ahlaundoe already have a 100 parse???
[3:29:54] radassbadass69: it's the gnomer boss armor, that's it
[3:29:56] Chipnizzle: Just got off the phone to aggrend he said just go priest man
[3:29:58] Final_Griever: Because they are looking to p3 and 4
[3:30:00] Sneakzx: maybe they know at 60 they will be chads
[3:30:03] thisisnotanick: @MrSlyth toke it up dude
[3:30:06] realmalfurionsr: I dont think they care
[3:30:11] Selecktt: Bro I've been a fury warrior main for 16 years. Warriors being shit for the beginning of every phase for every expac is the norm. But this phase is BEYOND bad. This is unplayable.
[3:30:12] dirtxnap: a dev told  him to reroll i think
[3:30:17] zach_smath: @Tangents92 mans a god
[3:30:20] vepsee: until shadowstep doesnt put shit on the gcd ill start liking it
[3:30:22] Wooshu: Naxx running 20 Warriors says it all
[3:30:32] Wooshu: Suffer early, claim glory later
[3:30:32] jerfishmen: you know you can see the runes for each class for wrist and head in the talent calculator
[3:30:32] Tangents92: @zach_smath KEKW
[3:30:40] Tangents92: Hop in disc
[3:30:42] Tangents92: lmao
[3:30:54] Chipnizzle: 60 will come and you'll undoubtedly have bladestorm and all that whacky shit. Patience
[3:30:58] meshon_: other classes are way more fun to play then warrior
[3:31:13] scolh: hunter is the most fun ever
[3:31:17] handy_grenade: does soni have a rogue
[3:31:22] vepsee: idk how people playing male human warriors in games
[3:31:22] scolh: gooping a bridge in ab and playing cod zombies
[3:31:24] Sparkel: Shadow priest is GREAT
[3:31:26] meshon_: on retail tho... warrior is so fun
[3:31:36] CDank: smh
[3:31:40] Lannakzach: Deep Wounds did PUMP in phase 1
[3:31:43] Wooshu: they are pumpers in PVE, PVP they are not
[3:31:43] scolh: i still think they are good
[3:31:49] julionowis: Do you think dual wield arms can be good at 60 with all these new stuff from sod?
[3:31:50] Fierceee: I agree, buff hunters.
[3:31:56] Selecktt: Why I find it completely unplayable is that I am decent in raids. Not great, not terrible. But useless in pvp. I am only allowed to be decent in one area of the game. Not viable in any other aspect this phase.
[3:31:57] Chipnizzle: You reckon Pepsi Max gives you cancer?
[3:31:57] Stubb21: I stupidly leveled warrior for p2 and regret that, literally one shot by mages and locks, good luck trying to fight a priest, and then pve feels clunky
[3:32:00] cruzjc1991: PrideRise VirtualHug <3
[3:32:01] radassbadass69: it's literally just gnomer's boss armor and overtuning a few caster specs LUL
[3:32:09] Ramadoon: If we got wf effect while enraged we'd be good, am i tripping?
[3:32:12] cruzjc1991: wearing the yellow sonii training shorts xD
[3:32:20] Ramadoon: like as a rune
[3:32:22] vepsee: its the only thing to look forward to KEKW
[3:32:26] miloxz: in two weeks bro will be trying to flex his parses
[3:32:28] Sparkel: @Stubb21 i did the same, but after 1 day of lvl 40 i lvled a priest and never looked back KEKW
[3:32:29] handy_grenade: tell that to the guilds recruiting by parse
[3:32:41] WcWillow: LUL
[3:32:43] traylz91: do you like the amity affliction sonii?
[3:32:43] ewokkin: LUL
[3:32:56] Fierceee: Doesn't matter what class I play, I ain't getting what I want
[3:32:57] Wooshu: PVE Warriors DPS is unmatched other than a fire mage. I remember running Ashenvale raid and Warriors topped the charts
[3:33:07] Fierceee: Galaga
[3:33:10] yarrpeter: Galaga?
[3:33:25] VanillaPete_: I've been playing warrior and priest, been a pretty good time overall, but warrior in pvp feels pretty bad most of the time
[3:33:29] Stubb21: @sparkel yeah I’m at that point tbh haha
[3:33:30] Fierceee: Why did you pronounce it like that
[3:33:32] TuvaIaTimmy: GALAGA THESE NUTS
[3:33:35] WcWillow: LUL  gal a ga
[3:33:38] yarrpeter: GAL UH GAH
[3:33:42] vepsee: no shot you just said guh lawga
[3:33:45] yarrpeter: yep
[3:33:46] Fierceee: There you go
[3:33:50] Fierceee: 3rd time is the charm

[3:34:37] WcWillow: LETHIMCOOK
[3:34:47] pkwy: lol
[3:34:58] yarrpeter: You sound like the people coming into the bar asking for a Reposado tequila. "can I get that resporado?" OMEGALUL
[3:34:59] vepsee: why arent you parsing BFD p2
[3:35:06] jerfishmen: head and wrist runes are showed on wow head for next phase in talent calculator
[3:35:23] yarrpeter: I'm excited to see your hair tho
[3:35:29] Wooshu: People still ask for parses for BFD raid groups at 40 KEKW
[3:35:33] Selecktt: No sustain, no utility, no mobility, no CC, no escapes, not even the tankiest class. But we can do the most damage against viscous fallout. So it's all balanced out I guess.
[3:35:39] handy_grenade: some happy rogue

[4:27:55] averyjames_: 6 months!!!!!!!!!!!
[4:27:57] vepsee: @Greasy_Doug yea it is but people LOVE the idea of fresh servers so everyones on the same playing field at the same time
[4:27:59] sawyerou: I hope they make an SM raid in EPL max level instead of another Nax raid
[4:28:02] Selecktt: blizz cant milk classic forever. They dont have much choice but to do some sort of classic+ or classic revamp following sod if they want to keep classic going

[4:34:14] lampsterof79: 40 Warrior charged my 32 hunter in the Crypts in Duskwood while I was in combat.  I turned around just wanting to give up so he would leave me alone but my auto attack took him out.  No special runes at the time.

[4:50:46] Indomitablez: @ballsofruenkiller you should be good now. I found nothing to see why you were being monitored. May have been a message you posted about age in the past that restricted comments
[4:51:05] ballsofruenkiller: maybe so.. sorry for the fuss.
[4:51:09] YuuffyOnTwitch: Pog
[4:51:11] vepsee: sony isnt actually SCHIZO
[4:51:12] sysfantasm: The biggest long-term case for WoW is that it's now helmed by Microsoft, biggest company by market cap in US. They could literally have it be a loss leader if they so desired.

[4:52:51] Indomitablez: @SONII There was no record of why. There was some age comments in the past so that could have been twitch doing it automatically
[4:53:26] ballsofruenkiller: "I'm a real booy!" -ballsofruenkiller or pinocchio?
[4:53:59] vepsee: KEKW
[4:54:05] Pixiepantss: HUH
