[2:23:20] silleye_: Microsoft should just burn up and never come back
[2:23:24] thymos_: monkaS
[2:23:29] TheUnknowing: that would basically mean they would have to remove sub which there is no way WoW will ever be free lol
[2:23:36] jkitchin75: si is amazon buying EA

[2:23:53] thymos_: we talked about it yesterday
[2:23:56] KingSpud91: Honestly people will never be happy, no matter how much side content there is
[2:24:22] jkitchin75: @silleye_ why
[2:24:25] Broomba: True!
[2:24:25] strike879: dragon riding is about as much content as pet battling in current wow
[2:24:26] Funderik: the races are content
[2:24:29] Aypex01: but it is the only new feature
[2:24:36] Shrenko: people watch the trailer and see customizable dragons and dragon riding and think its the main focus of the expansion
[2:24:37] Jeanssi: content is always the same. raid, pvp, m+, cosmetics. ppl should know it by now
[2:24:44] silleye_: Cause of Gates
[2:24:46] TIny_Rrick: but everyone was cranking one out to dragon riding for a month

[2:26:07] strike879: walking challange the new iron man challange
[2:26:55] Jeanssi: outlaw rogue and their treasure tracking will be op for finding those, if those are random spawns, not fixed locations
[2:27:05] Volatilestyle: professions always end game for the first patch or two
[2:27:12] MeisterPetze: i am so happy for the solo que arena. finaly back to pvp and ignore m+ and raids
[2:27:14] dewking93: can i get a full set of mythic from just proffesions?
[2:27:49] Ganondood: towellie, superbowl pick?
[2:27:58] TheUnknowing: yeah but dont you have to do the raids to be able to get the stuff to craft the quality?
[2:28:12] thunder993: reagents come from raids and m+ ye
[2:29:27] thunder993: with work orders someone gives you mats to craft it for them
[2:29:50] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad

[2:30:28] futomara01: good
[2:30:35] theos666: @Towelliee How far into professions can you go solo (no BG, M+, Raids) only AH?
[2:30:36] Volatilestyle: but you can still buy it?
[2:31:19] geokouts: its like a preorder

[2:31:37] strike879: no
[2:32:05] zanches98: you know when the great puch starts today??
[2:32:31] geokouts: 3h 59 mins
[2:32:49] manmower: big announcement
[2:32:51] riskqey: so what looks like the best/ worst tanks for this new expansion, sorry if this has already been asked
[2:33:01] Khartax: They should make M+ gear scale in Mythic + to higher ilvl so M+ dont have to raid mythic and Mythic raiders dont have to spam M+
[2:33:01] reggiepowa: tgp in 4 hours?
[2:33:02] Honvar: It will be 3h 59 mins later Kappa
[2:33:02] strike879: would still need to level the proffesion which would cost allot + time then need to get the reagents either legit or from boost so likely easier to just get ilvl from m+
[2:33:08] Volatilestyle: he was responding to a chatter lol
[2:33:11] geokouts: the great push on yt and twitch
[2:33:34] szble: the great sleeper

[2:33:52] t0pgun_: 35 is the max key level in tgp
[2:33:54] Elff11: Ambition also +2 a 35 JY if I recon correctly LUL
[2:33:57] reggiepowa: to be fair all na teams last week did 35 junkyard which is the max key anyway

[2:36:10] Rakim88: cancelled by harry potter fans
[2:36:20] Finiin: @Broomba water

[2:48:44] dawnovun: @Towelliee can you open achievements and go to arena to see if they have any new Solo Rated cheeves?
[2:49:03] MoJoShMaN: are blue light glasses worth? I never get a headache or anything
[2:49:21] genjosanso: but can use my sky golem in dragonflight?
[2:49:25] Honvar: Are you going to play Hogwarts Legacy @Towelliee ?

[2:50:35] dawnovun: @Towelliee can you open achievements and go to arena to see if they have any new Solo Rated cheeves?

[2:51:05] futomara01: not since cata
[2:51:06] procyon_mfc: I'm happy with that
[2:51:19] Bernardo994: when have we ever had it up front?
[2:51:21] m4gnify: just a bit sad you can't use normal mounts, maybe you could use them with dargonriding
[2:51:43] Bernardo994: i think this is the first
[2:51:48] reggiepowa: cata was last when expansion you could fly from start
[2:52:03] Bernardo994: o really
[2:52:04] strike879: i hope 10.2 they add a tallent in the dragonride tree where you can use the dragon as a normal mount but also have the dragonride powers
[2:52:07] dawnovun: To be clear, dragonriding  (the visual speed effect) only works on SOME mounts while other mounts work in the new zone but work normally?

[2:54:30] strike879: its called dragonriding not crabriding
[2:54:31] DoctorWhiteFace: nether drakes plz
[2:54:42] Funderik: they could add new mount equipment based around the perk/talents from dragonriding.
[2:54:42] StoicTaurus: tbh .. Dragonriding is good for traveling. But worthless for example for gathering..
[2:54:49] auschad: well it could just be an upgrade to flying system altogether
[2:54:49] Frutzgar: Next expansion: World of Warcraft Crabriding

[4:29:03] KyleEverett: @dracullus No, there's bugs and fixes that are eneded.
[4:29:23] KyleEverett: There's often a smaller patch about a week or two after launch

[4:34:02] BIGxTPx23: yeah that is true
[4:34:06] N3llee: did you ever do a react video to Max's interview with Ion? Curious what your take on things were
[4:34:07] strike879: only in FF they accept if a boss isnt perfect
[4:34:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[4:34:24] Nehcrom: No it did not but I hear what you are saying.
[4:34:25] Vannadil: Got em
[4:34:26] m4gnify: if they payed workers instead of hoping the players report problems they could
[4:34:31] dracullus: what? I'm not center of universe?
[4:34:40] WarsickLive: do you think the ui changes comes with the prepatch

[4:35:17] Shrenko: üê∑ üê∑
[4:35:24] ArcaneMaki: So splits uh?
[4:35:44] N3llee: Ion basically handed us a lauch date there at the end with the mythic raid question
[4:35:52] Strouss: it was great, it was like a rogue in stealth and Ion the hunter  was right behind him with flare up laughing.
[4:35:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having a lot of WQ's is good
[4:35:59] Molvonos: Towelliee's reaction to Max's interview with Ion: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1573109979?collection=6DB80KkQAhcHsA
[4:36:02] dracullus: Ion had that look when homeless man tell you his life story and you know he just want some money
[4:36:04] Nehcrom: @leundergroundwizard What previous interviews with streamers was scripted?
[4:36:17] z0rath: He wasnt mad about ur reaction but he wasnt pushing that question to pugs but instead for guilds, he just fucked up the formation of the word apparently
[4:36:20] HighThereBud: lmfaO
[4:37:09] Peqdevil: all about perception
[4:37:09] monute316: monute316 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 100 months, currently on a 98 month streak! 
[4:37:17] z0rath: Yeah i hope Ion understood that wasnt the point since the overall interview was great imo
[4:37:27] Nehcrom: @leundergroundwizard Lore was a employee from blizzard?
[4:37:59] Nehcrom: @Towelliee Yes but we are not talking present but past.
[4:38:00] Aidler: we need a AI analyze everything Ion said in the past and then calculate a release date‚Ä¶ lol
[4:38:03] falldrgn: he making that bank
[4:38:12] Roaringkittylol: Hes a manly man - a boss
[4:38:14] notColt45: Good for him, that's dope
[4:38:15] cinnamints: Yeah, it legitimately stresses Max out that anyone might think the guild wants to do more mythic splits, sales, etc. They hate it.
[4:38:15] WSeveryn: @Towelliee I remember Maintankadin, and that's where I first saw Lore
[4:38:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: making that fuck you blizzard money
[4:38:34] m4gnify: chinese companies taking over the world
[4:38:34] ArcaneMaki: Lore is a good dude. good for him

[4:39:43] wxlfvoid: oh snap Towelliee going to tiktok
[4:39:44] wxlfvoid: lets go
[4:39:46] Nehcrom: Just like why I watch Towel through the years he is a solid streamer that is himself no matter what.
[4:39:55] Funderik: mixer v2.
[4:40:02] N3llee: got some ea stock @Towelliee ?
[4:40:09] Broomba: streaming wow on tik tok is the wwo mmo everyone wants KEKW
[4:40:22] dewking93: tiktok is only phone viewing right ?
[4:40:22] Nehcrom: I liked the ending with Ion he is opening up!
[4:40:28] N3llee: he gave us a really good launch window though
[4:40:38] dracullus: they love tease us with dates
[4:40:40] luckfore: towStop towIt ion
[4:40:45] z0rath: I bet he was laughing out loud when he left the interview with the fire that he may started LUL
[4:40:53] notColt45: Keeps people on the forums distracted
[4:40:57] Ochrasy: when do we expect beta to start?
[4:40:59] fewyn: i don't blame him
[4:41:05] brozzy: why is the whole release thing an issue? just do it
[4:41:07] Nehcrom: What would be the cons for opening up all @Towelliee ?
[4:41:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm with that forum guy who said to open up LFR, too
[4:41:38] ShadoodHD: jokes on him it'll give them more headache KEKW
[4:42:08] z0rath: Maybe some people feel "forced" to play more in order to get mythic kills early for half hardcore week but overall it wont affect anything but BOE farming too i suppose
[4:42:13] Peqdevil: effecetabout half a dozend guilds
[4:42:13] Maldor313: it only affects 0.1 % guilds LUL
[4:42:15] lithium364: theyre catering to the 1% BabyRage
[4:42:21] Nehcrom: Valid point.
[4:42:24] maalow: even WF guilds wouldn't try mythic week 1
[4:42:30] Funderik: if anything it hurts the 1% more because they have to decide on going into mythic or split runs.
[4:42:37] z0rath: BOE farming week one its going to be crazy if that happends
[4:42:41] lithium364: only one trying mythic week 1 is rextroy
[4:42:53] falldrgn: or just don't release during the holidays?
[4:43:07] N3llee: you know the raid is easier cause they are not tuning to wf guilds and its the first raid of the xpac so its easier then anything else
[4:43:07] PodracerWill: People are definitely going to complain because there's going to be so many guilds not able to clear Mythic before holidays
[4:43:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is definitely an increased challenge to do mythic sooner, without having to overtune the raid
[4:43:18] Xetherot: another november release would be awesome.
[4:43:27] Nehcrom: As always you make sense in the context @Towelliee thanks for the good answer.
[4:43:41] z0rath: @PodracerWill I mean u can cut half of this message and say "People are definitely going to complain" KEKW
[4:43:42] KaisenSiru: anniesPray anniesPray anniesPray
[4:43:53] dracullus: they want that Christmas money, game would have to be broken to move launch to January
[4:43:59] moa285: The biggest problem I find with this is that the ones who would get upset would be the ones who are most visible and audible. So what?
[4:44:01] strike879: cant you make a guild and then use the mobile banking for all the fish?
[4:44:12] Crisis88: If its a 1 week Mythic clear.
[4:44:16] lithium364: i say release the expac in october :kekw
[4:44:23] luckfore: not announcing anything btw Kappa
[4:44:35] N3llee: no way its not going to be easy
[4:44:37] KaisenSiru: Noooooo
[4:44:41] m4gnify: first tier, it's probably going to be over fast
[4:44:50] Throdio: I like the amount of time CN and SoD took
[4:44:56] Baldarsar: how about  mythic comes in january out and all is good
[4:44:59] TynGuy: let those poor devs have the holidays off
[4:45:01] Crisis88: Im just thinking of the ilvl difference from not having a extra week to focus on heroic splits.
[4:45:06] SimonHalfSoul: !BETA

[4:46:07] gritbarontv: yup, also those guilds are a business, so they have execute perfectly.
[4:46:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Watching them wipe on that damned crab for days on end was so brutal
[4:46:21] KaisenSiru: Hopefully it will all mostly be Painsmith -like fights
[4:46:43] SteLawBro: Balance across difficulties has been pretty solid for a while now, no?
[4:46:53] ShadoodHD: i just hope they dont pressure themselves from all the release, especially if there will be all that rwf hype/sponsorships in those timelines
[4:47:16] Funderik: the people saying delay till jan are tyhe same people that will say there is no content and rage about it.
[4:47:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the sweaty players don't want to be idle for weeks
[4:47:26] notColt45: They did that in SL, they know it's bad LUL
[4:47:41] falldrgn: Imean.. its the same issue.. if content is too casual or lacking.. the no lifers w ill do it in a week then bitch that theres no content
[4:47:49] lithium364: but how can we get to play dragonflight, if nothing escapes the maw
[4:47:53] yardmmada: HOORAY DRAGONFLIGHT

[4:48:10] notColt45: I was thinking more after the first raid
[4:48:13] luckfore: in Legion the raid was 3 weeks after launch
[4:48:22] mace2k2: How is leveling as a Brewmaster?  Is it much slower?
[4:48:30] WSeveryn: @Towelliee they just need to release the date it comes out, so I can schedule my vacation.
[4:48:35] wxlfvoid: sucks world of warcraft dont have a battle pass
[4:48:58] PodracerWill: Many peeps will get their full lfr gear and dip out
[4:49:01] Throdio: I am gambling on it coming out 28/29 and put in PTO for it.
[4:49:06] yardmmada: it does not need a battle pass
[4:49:07] manmower: are they all 30 levels for renown tracks?

[4:50:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think Ion is right on this, release them all and let players figure it out
[4:50:57] luckfore: feral is complete Kapp
[4:50:57] Throdio: Do you think Ion asking the question for all raid difficulties at once is him asking? Or saying it's going to happen
[4:50:59] Jeanssi: no incarn was nyi

[5:01:19] Sunyankzi: Could you make a note on those items that they should be learnable toys. That way they don't clutter up your bags. @Towelliee
[5:01:29] PrimalTV: He didn't exactly whine about not getting alpha, he didn't expect to get it
[5:01:38] CritcobainTV: ayye, Good mornin fellas

[5:02:21] CritcobainTV: Dude, the dream team flavor is AMAZING. I need more lol
[5:02:35] CritcobainTV: I wasn't a fan of the strawberry banana one though, had a chalky aftertaste to me no matter how much i shake it
[5:02:36] TynGuy: he also wanted bigger mobs to fight for the ohnaran hunts and cool fishing quest for the tuskar
[5:02:41] yardmmada: So long as they buff heroic dungeons, storms are just optional fun world content

[5:04:26] DaBestGAround: agree, enjoyment of the game is better than trying to follow FOTM
[5:04:32] Broomba: @yardmmada exactly, trying to copy the meta is stupid, just play what you want to play and have fun
[5:04:56] im_capy: making videos complaining is the hot take for the YT algorithm

[5:05:41] TynGuy: preach wanted more thematic quests

[5:05:55] rensdeamo: c'mon - they are the billion dollar company - they should invent
[5:05:59] CanadianCataclysm: Here is MMO's - Go  get quest - Gather, loot or kill - Go to quest giver or quest turn in.... Now it just matters on which MMO you like Cause they are all the same
[5:05:59] Reason1803: Make the kill the mobs more interesting.  Give you buffs to play around with while killing the mobs.  Not just plain kill x mobs each time.
[5:06:06] Aidler: guess it‚Äôs a life is boring thing..
[5:06:07] Zzz_wipeout_zzZ: @Towelliee if you speak to blizzard every day tell them i want to fly around on my Demon hunter like the dragons lol
[5:06:08] Zeuzo: Make them fun
[5:06:14] crittinkitten: Preach was using the covenant assaults in the maw as a comparison @Towelliee
[5:06:14] deffomythicraider: Holy..  there zones look massive
[5:06:16] Zeuzo: 100 mobs spawn that u aoe down
[5:06:17] Shubwub: @Buckwink what are you talking about lmao
[5:06:19] Arman2077: !discord
[5:06:25] Kornukopian: @Jason_Broke But how would that be "better"? Different looks, yet similar things would still run through its veins...
[5:06:28] strike879: could use warden like quests again like kill elite quest done
[5:06:29] skymercii: i know it wont happen but i want legendaries to mean something then just farming a dungeon or a raid
[5:06:30] bobbyg24k: Add a battle royal , like cod, 100 players battle to the end while the circle closes
[5:06:37] Neowanderer: a solution would be take a sidekick with you and earn rep with him like the dude in najatar
[5:06:43] ozilot: delete rep
[5:06:46] loutre_malgache: Problem is, everyone has different tastes. Some people prefer puzzles, some people prefer to kill a big pack of mobs and be done, some people prefer mini games. No one will ever be content. Just accept that WQ will be a variety of things and will take like 30min per day to do or just stop doing them ...
[5:06:47] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @towelliee MAKE MULTIBOXING GREAT AGAIN LET US USE THE APP LIKE BEFORE
[5:06:48] DaBestGAround: make the bar invisible, is obviously the right choice

[5:06:55] Choderz: LMAO
[5:06:55] NickLeonhearth: Get him OUT!!!
[5:06:56] Funderik: this is why you don't skip the quest or the text, you know wtf is going on if you read, ignoring it then acting like it makes no sense is stupid.
[5:06:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having WQ's where you solve a mystery could be alright, but some people will get frustrated with those
[5:07:02] Alienfromger: KEKW
[5:07:03] Maxtavius: "I'm tired of killing things and filling bars" said the player of a game where you kill things and fill bars
[5:07:03] bobbyg24k: lol
[5:07:03] itsDets: KEKW
[5:07:06] TynGuy: the ohnaran planes could have big hunts not just a mid turtle and more hunts with cool monster that fit there lore

[5:07:27] yardmmada: React to Preaches video???
[5:07:39] ApocAFK: Kinda somewhat like a puzzle, but it would be cool to see something akin to Runescape clue scrolls as an activity
[5:07:46] strike879: yea that wouldnt work you would enter the zone while the ring is small insta ded on landing qq on forums
[5:07:47] Roaringkittylol: The point is MMORPGs are boring these days - every game is the same cycle - there really isnt anything new to add. The genre has been fleshed out and matured.
[5:07:48] skymercii: @HaxzorJimDuggan i laughed way to hard at this
[5:07:56] CanadianCataclysm: MMO's are build around how much fun you have. Everyone is likes different things and it engages them for different amount of times..... Just get into a Guild or Community and just be social.
[5:07:57] grimginder: So legendaries are obviously non existent start of this xpac right? Haven't been following at all lol
[5:08:08] Tkfoxy: Tkfoxy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months!

[5:09:31] RollieTheZergling: pvp the only fun part of this game
[5:09:36] ShadoodHD: and we are VERY diversified on this topic HahaShrugLeft HahaShrugMiddle HahaShrugRight
[5:09:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: PvP is going to be the wild west, people are going to have to figure out the metas as the trees change and get tuned
[5:09:45] Bsirk: How about adding a lot of scenarios like in mop?
[5:09:45] Aidler: pvp is not the solution for the masses
[5:09:47] StoicTaurus: Blizz even have some unique WQs ... like chores or flapping in Bastion or sneaking WQ in Maldraxxus, flying on prasol or racing in Revendreth.
[5:10:02] Tiamarilien: Ashran was the last time they tried to renew pvp outside war mode.
[5:10:03] Funderik: no he's not, he's looking at the world map only and saying it's only fill the bar content.
[5:10:06] bobbyg24k: Overall wow has all it needs. Not much more to add.
[5:10:07] Macrodotz: they need to make quests harder it sux just one shot ting everything
[5:10:08] RollieTheZergling: there is no 1 solution for the masses
[5:10:13] strike879: only thing i somewhat agree on the do a dozen steps WQ are not really fun they take too long and give too little
[5:10:14] im_capy: he rather have a slow story, which causes most of us to fall asleep. to each their own
[5:10:18] yardmmada: FF is BORING
[5:10:19] Aidler: we had scenarios and islands etc in the past‚Ä¶
[5:10:27] HopeThePriest: I mean i thought preach didnt care anymore and had this big long bye warcraft video with all the tears after all these years?
[5:10:27] rensdeamo: Puzzles ;) - As I wrote they are the billion $ companye - they should invent
[5:10:42] Agotrox: can you make unit frames bigger and with large hp ?
[5:10:42] brozzy: fun gameplay shouldnt be restricted by lore/story i think is what people are saying
[5:10:44] M0dro: you and preach have some weird vendetta going on
[5:10:46] Redshaman999: casino
[5:10:49] zz1m: mop farm
[5:10:50] NBK_Sethus: quests in general need to be something more than braindead 5 min grind that requires no player engagement
[5:10:50] ShadoodHD: so preach is experiencing FF story withdrawal monkaHmm
[5:10:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: dance studio
[5:10:53] luckfore: if he thinks ff14 is so amazing, why doesnt he just stick to that

[5:11:07] yardmmada: Hey Towellie, I know you don't like PVP but more World PVP stuff would be super duper haha
[5:11:08] GivTater: bring back MoP farming.
[5:11:08] CanadianCataclysm: Get them to give some Monthly events like Lost Ark has done.
[5:11:10] CaptnCojones: player economy and meaningful crafting
[5:11:11] gamernick410: I want to go rank 14 on retail
[5:11:38] kraydom: LUL
[5:11:39] im_capy: a toggle to turn transmog off, its one of the biggest things classic players bitch about
[5:11:40] gentlemangrand: ppl not wanting killing quests want more escort quests?
[5:11:43] manmower: dance parties

[5:12:07] iamtheonlycdn: survival mode where you can kill enemies wave after wave for as long as you can
[5:12:08] Alienfromger: companion system from swtor
[5:12:09] Kornukopian: @bobbyg24k lol, no. That would be a horrible idea.
[5:12:09] manmower: meaningful choice
[5:12:11] metrohotness: writs
[5:12:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: writs, yes

[5:12:23] Zzz_wipeout_zzZ: if there was a easy solution then it would be in every mmo, there is no way to please absolutely every player in a game
[5:12:26] Proto_Paradigm: @Towelliee I enjoyed the MoP farm area, and the WoD animal training building in the garrison.
[5:12:26] Ziephier: wasn't there an area where they were going to have player housing in the beginning but ruled it out - they did put in the farm in Pandaria and the Garrison

[5:13:11] luckfore: what kinda quests does ff has @Towelliee
[5:13:11] Funderik: lol what wow's transmog is the best
[5:13:13] fewyn: it could be better though
[5:13:13] abracka_: compared to GW2 and ESO at least
[5:13:16] crittinkitten: What about fill the bar + an escort quest at the same time
[5:13:18] Maxtavius: I'd def take a slot mog instead of a item mog
[5:13:20] DoughBoi_Trev: WE STILL CANT DYE OUR ARMOR
[5:13:28] m4gnify: what is GW2 one like?

[5:13:36] Funderik: @fewyn how? it has everything already, what more could you need
[5:13:37] Wukain: what about they get rid of all the bots
[5:13:39] GamingDad77: I am going to be as nice as I can about this.......F   U   C   K   escort quests

[5:13:45] Retpally9329: maybe when they lift the restrictions on plate/cloth and just let us wear whatever
[5:13:50] moose_noodlez: give him a break
[5:13:51] Ziephier: WOW transmog costs a lot less than BDO - in BDO you have to buy costumes
[5:13:55] ShadoodHD: its only missing the color utility in xmog towRee
[5:13:56] FluffehZ: Not saying it's bad, just need extended options and Dye rooThink
[5:14:05] Bsirk: I would like a shit ton more dungeons to do.

[5:14:09] yardmmada: Uhh Towelliee, worth watching Preaches video on Stream or no, not really? I think it might be good for the community that takes videos as gosspil.

[5:19:05] wxlfvoid: Towelliee be real did enjoy shadowlands? @Towelliee
[5:19:05] 011chris011: I feel like action based combat will never work for pvp
[5:19:06] PadhraigM: Presentation can make a difference. While the end result is the same, the progress during can either be dull, or somewhat enjoyable. But that varies from person to person, so it isn't one solution for all. It's tough, and I have no clue how to make it better.
[5:19:15] wxlfvoid: did you*
[5:19:18] notorietyy: notorietyy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months!

[5:20:21] BrothaLatinoHeat76: !beta
[5:20:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: I bet

[5:20:45] Macrodotz: I started cata times
[5:20:46] Broomba: TBC @Otti1214
[5:20:55] CanadianCataclysm: World Quests that Grow with harder / more mobs and more rewards... Also make a rotating carnival with different games as well as different people hosting in on a 4 week rotation that goes to different Major Cities.
[5:20:57] z0rath: I got to Mythic sludgefist at 9.0 and then left because they were taking too long without content and im not coming back untill DF i suppoe
[5:20:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[5:20:58] Blleyzen: true
[5:21:02] BrothaLatinoHeat76: !WOTLK
[5:21:02] Moobot: @BrothaLatinoHeat76 I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[5:21:03] llNoTToXiCll: this was one of those expansions where its bad but make you come back for the next expansion if you ever thought of it that way
[5:21:12] WoWRoach: I thought most of that was becasue of the Blizzard controversy  within the company, not becasue of the actual game.
[5:21:13] yardmmada: Feedback for Blizzard: Allow us to farm rep via wearing a tabard or having X buff and farming Dungeons or PvP. = Don't want to farm rep via WQ? Fine, farm via the content you enjoy. (Pls suggest that to Blizz @Towelliee)
[5:21:16] Giffbot: can't blame that on JUST how bad SL was, it was partly due to the lawsuit and the big names saying they were done with Blizz
[5:21:32] wxlfvoid: hate the fact when i log on for prepatch i have to log into that crap area.
[5:21:35] ScurvyHyam: I think wow needs more good competition of mmorpg other than FF14
[5:21:36] Molvonos: I got to watch Asmongold on my FFXIV server utterly lag the FUCK out of the Golden Saucer due to his rabid fanbase.  Made doing all those events nearly impossible.
[5:21:42] kyr_slowbro: Yeah lawsuit was a biggie for me
[5:21:44] llNoTToXiCll: @Towelliee this was one of those expansions where its bad but make you come back for the next expansion if you ever thought of it that way
[5:22:00] PodracerWill: Legion private servers are popular. kinda indicates how good the expansion it was
[5:22:11] luckfore: we havent had tabards since mop lol
[5:22:21] nocturnal_2195: I played way more WoW on WoD then I did in SL
[5:22:27] yardmmada: Just saying, gives people an alternative!
[5:22:45] wxlfvoid: why can we not get a update to ta bards like having certain logos that can fit on certain area of armor?
[5:22:49] Runetailx: Only only tabard matters, Tabard of the Achiever
[5:22:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: ooooh Tuskarr tabard
[5:22:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Molvonos a coin toss decided between my lost ark server and where he ended up, i was prepared to change everything to avoid him lol
[5:22:58] futomara01: @Towelliee we need all previous reps and currencies account wide
[5:23:01] a_joc: sorry im late to the party, rep is now renown? @Towelliee
[5:23:14] Broomba: @Molvonos that sucks
[5:23:25] luckfore: they give extra rep?
[5:23:44] yardmmada: The tabard idea could be slower but a nice alternative for people that are so anti WQ
[5:23:50] Maxtavius: hell, I'd take a BoA "rep" tabard
[5:23:51] DevilSpire: @Towelliee i think they should go back to dungeon rep
[5:24:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like that idea of tabards for catch-up rep
[5:25:02] Glisur85: Yo, good morning Towelllie, good morning chat
[5:25:14] HopeThePriest: @Towelliee  I like the MoP system at revered you cld buy the BoA rep  gain boost

[5:25:33] Smelladafarts: Smelladafarts subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[5:25:35] richonthebeach: does tower control zone still kae sense,with crossfaction activity?

[5:25:57] nocturnal_2195: LUL
[5:26:09] mhunt2424: My Olympic tabard.
[5:26:09] Funderik: they could make tabards give some like coloured trail when you walk/run
[5:26:11] draxss: i always have my tabard of the light bringer on
[5:26:18] Macrodotz: yay
[5:26:40] Molvonos: @Towelliee They actually did covenant buffs when you unlocked something in the covenant with anima.  You could go get one of three buffs every day that persisted in open world content.
[5:26:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think warmode bonus depends some on faction balance
[5:26:54] wxlfvoid: KEKW
[5:26:59] yardmmada: World PvP WQ are so much fun - ie MoP Krasarang Wilds
[5:27:09] wxlfvoid: Alliance was the best pvp races out there they still are
[5:27:14] wxlfvoid: everyone plays alliance
[5:27:15] im_capy: bfa pathfinder 1 &2  makes you realize how far we have come with DF
[5:27:33] Rajasti: i played up to lvl 57 and quit , do you guys think its any worth coming back now or should i just wait next exp?
[5:27:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: 0
[5:28:06] Molvonos: @Rajasti depends on why you quit
[5:28:27] Rajasti: wasnt feeling it with shadowlands, found the new zones dull and quests boring but i didnt reach max lvl so
[5:28:44] Rajasti: didnt experiment max lvl content of SL
[5:29:05] yardmmada: Walking into DF with 305 and nuking kids in PvP is gunna feel great
[5:29:11] SpoofAvatar: LUL
[5:29:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Right now the gearing is confusing, but getting the level up and trying out Shadowlands stuff is not bad
[5:29:50] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[5:29:51] Rajasti: hmm

[5:30:10] yardmmada: No scaling or I wouldn't play LOL don't scare me
[5:30:10] wxlfvoid: Yeah
[5:30:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tier set slots and crafted legendaries and zereth mortis gear....it's tricky to get all that sorted
[5:30:16] Snabido: @creative_soups Noice
[5:30:20] yardmmada: WEoD gear but not scaling unless I am wrong
[5:30:20] wxlfvoid: Not like pvers are going to care but yeah they are
[5:30:21] reggiepowa: most of my alts which only hit lvl 60 are like 140 ilvl so it's gonna be a bit of a struggle at start
[5:30:21] SilkeySmooth: pvp is not just arena
[5:30:37] yardmmada: Legion was scaling not WoD and it was sad times
[5:30:40] wxlfvoid: Xmog
[5:30:42] SilkeySmooth: wod gear scaling
[5:30:44] yardmmada: WoD was just simpler gearing
[5:30:46] wxlfvoid: No trasnmog
[5:30:55] 00birdhouse: you're going to get a RSI from all the fish turn in
[5:30:57] macheek: !wotlk
[5:30:57] Moobot: @macheek I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[5:31:04] yardmmada: Nah Wod Was honor gear and Conquest gear
[5:31:08] yardmmada: No leveling the gear
[5:31:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: If the Dragonflight prepatch gear is like 226 or whatever, you can start it with some lousy gear....and you can get better than that fairly easy now
[5:31:44] reggiepowa: no gear leveling in pvp only for pve
[5:31:54] Rajasti: so basically dont need to gear up for pvp?
[5:31:55] yardmmada: yeah
[5:31:58] Rajasti: damn
[5:32:06] yardmmada: but pvp gear will scale up in pvp
[5:32:09] SilkeySmooth: no more gear ranks cap conquest get conquest gear
[5:32:11] yardmmada: but not templates for your class
[5:32:14] yardmmada: kinda confusing
[5:32:25] yardmmada: but no templates ! which is good ! that was awful !
[5:32:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: 252 is not bad starter gear
[5:32:28] SpoofAvatar: cypher gear
[5:33:01] woodgnomes: wait so if I'm full 304/311 am I replacing anything?!?
[5:33:30] Katariatv: how much rep for each turn in
[5:33:37] Katariatv: oh nvm
[5:33:39] Zionid: @woodgnomes not before heroic dungeons i believe
[5:33:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, the PvP depends on all that PvE tuning
[5:33:52] Templexx: *doesnt spec into a stun
[5:33:53] Templexx: lol
[5:33:54] Lunarr0: like mop pvp lmao
