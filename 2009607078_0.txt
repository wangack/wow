[3:40:13] PaperbackWritter: what item do you want?
[3:40:50] Sylas26: no, it's in atlas, mark of remulus is crafted easily, except 4 skins of shadow. badges are annoying quest, that require to farm 30xelites or trading crafted items like massive iron axes

[3:41:22] Sylas26: I was thinking of getting rockfury bracers but shelved the idea for now

[3:41:52] PaperbackWritter: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8574/stalwarts-battlegear this is the quest
[3:42:26] Sylas26: on horde side, you need a healer, they can solo it afaik, dps/tanks can't solo the quest it's the one with the war papers that need to be signed
