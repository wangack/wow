[0:40:49] NawtyTyme: did u start ur shammie?
[0:41:06] john57galt: I think they should have kept it at 50%, but until 40. 100% is a bit high.
[0:41:17] Winttyrr: season of dads
[0:41:21] Winttyrr: it's great
[0:41:22] Medifaded: Yeah I agree, and I think for the first season of SOD being more casual was a great choice
[0:41:30] Winttyrr: sucks i wont get to play it more
[0:41:31] Medifaded: future seasons can get more tryhard but its all about fun
[0:41:36] Winttyrr: im gonna miss cata too

[0:42:11] jmaurice07: 8 dont seem right
[0:42:28] PunChE_Who: I’m gonna say 8% is cap
[0:42:40] Medifaded: Yeah 8% seems really low but I do know its surprising how many ppl didnt clear.
[0:42:45] AnguishTM: more like 80% Kappa
[0:42:47] batchestspam: if true it def includes bank alts, bots, etc that never would raid

[0:43:38] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: hes here for staff
[0:43:42] CT_Wolfe: hes invested in the rod
[0:43:50] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: im guessing
[0:43:54] CT_Wolfe: yeah still bis
[0:43:58] CT_Wolfe: or pre bis
[0:44:11] CT_Wolfe: dagger + off hand, but a lot of people struggle getting both
[0:44:14] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: still hard to get both rolls in gnomer
[0:44:14] Medifaded: pre bis yea
[0:44:31] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: i lost it to ele shaman rip
[0:44:57] Winttyrr: that staff is prebis on all casters. the stats are insane
[0:45:00] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: they said they increased the epic drop rate
[0:45:09] VaughanVenture: Damn haven't been here in a minute, sick cut. Looking like Cloud
[0:45:32] Winttyrr: only thing the staff is missing really is stam
[0:45:49] Winttyrr: well, crit or hit too i guess but that would jus be greedy

[0:47:42] djOrris: Nothing wrong with luring lol. Been lurking Sonii since 2017 LOL
[0:47:58] PunChE_Who: should I reroll from Ally to go Sham? 🤔
[0:48:03] Winttyrr: yeah, ill prolly try and get a ps5 while im on base
[0:48:04] AlexKitch: bfa classic
[0:48:16] endustko: we should be on wod by then
[0:48:17] NawtyTyme: classic wow is the real game we all want
[0:48:18] JCRainFGC: Classic Classic WoW
[0:48:23] Selecktt: Classic+ Redux Reimagined 3.0
[0:48:25] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[0:48:26] djOrris: Classic++
[0:48:31] Eggzactly54: no
[0:48:34] NawtyTyme: no cata is the last of it
[0:48:35] lavitz24: no
[0:48:36] Gillbawk: pls no
[0:48:41] Amberiad: i doubt
[0:48:42] MeatyGorak: legion would be sick
[0:48:43] JCRainFGC: stay at Cata tbh
[0:48:44] lavitz24: they will do mop and then be done
[0:48:44] mitchp333: they better do mop
[0:48:46] direwolf575: soniiDance soniiDance soniiDance
[0:48:46] superAskh: I hope we don't get mop
[0:48:47] marcosaraujo96: Mop for sure
[0:48:47] Eridaisback: I dont think we get MOP
[0:48:48] Winttyrr: i legit doubt we hit mop
[0:48:54] Nightbot: Want to Subscribe for FREE?! Connect your twitch to your (or parent's) amazon prime account  soniiLewd https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[0:48:56] Selecktt: Cata shouldnt even be in classic. As much as I love it, they literally changed the world. it isnt classic by any stretch
[0:49:00] Slymmetrical: I really, really want to go back to the timeless isle in MOP
[0:49:00] lavitz24: they wont do WoD because it was the worst expac
[0:49:00] nate707x: mop was pretty fun
[0:49:05] Winttyrr: i always thought wed hit cata but never mop
[0:49:05] Dalbo420: Hot take: MoP is the best xpac
[0:49:06] averyjames_: MOP WAS THE BESTR
[0:49:08] direwolf575: no mop
[0:49:10] Dalbo420: Or not a hot take I guess lmao
[0:49:10] Eridaisback: Cata will kill it and gg blizzard predicts Mop to be worse tho and dont invest in it
[0:49:12] chalupacabras: MOP was great, but I feel like WOTLK was the last part of classic. Cata is pushing it!
[0:49:13] Azurion210: MoP Warrior <3
[0:49:20] kiki_speaks: I quit playing when mop came out
[0:49:23] Eggzactly54: we will get MoP and that should be the end of it. even a reset do over from classic would work
[0:49:25] Winttyrr: cata pvp > mop pvp
[0:49:26] Eridaisback: I'd prefer MoP over Cata tho tbh
[0:49:27] Captpopsicle: $$$
[0:49:29] godwarrlol: mop warrior was great, but ww monk was crazy in MoP
[0:49:30] NawtyTyme: i heard from a good source at the start of BC that we would get cata and thats it
[0:49:33] Azurion210: still missing them Banners as a warrior...
[0:49:35] roflpotamus: Cata and MoP forsure, doubt after that
[0:49:35] BigShag8: SOD is the future
[0:49:37] direwolf575: DoritosChip soniiPog
[0:49:43] averyjames_: i want cata and mop
[0:49:50] Winttyrr: id play TBC again, not mop
[0:49:50] XDemon85: I would play to Legion then stop  lmao
[0:49:51] Eggzactly54: if people are going to pay and play they wont stop
[0:49:52] NawtyTyme: its so WORTH
[0:50:04] Winttyrr: caddy?
[0:50:05] deltrexx: doesnt cata cost now
[0:50:11] chalupacabras: wotlk is already pretty empty with SOD and hardcore
[0:50:12] godwarrlol: Last time i played Cata was like 2011 on private servers
[0:50:16] JCRainFGC: thats a lot of time sadly
[0:50:17] Selecktt: I dont think it should go past classic. Anything further and it's not "classic", it's just "rerelease"
[0:50:18] luzid7: its kinda weird to call expansions after wrath "classic" :D
[0:50:26] Selecktt: past cata*
[0:50:26] Gimilkin: but retail expasions cost extra
[0:50:30] roflpotamus: @deltrexx tbc and wrath did for classic
[0:50:30] direwolf575: soniiYo soniiWave
[0:50:31] Nightbot: soniiYo
[0:50:31] Undankable: wrath is filled to the brim with bots
[0:50:34] averyjames_: wrath isnt empty lol
[0:50:44] Eggzactly54: casuals wont like cata
[0:50:55] Winttyrr: cata was the last xpac with the old school ttalent trees. it changed them but the core was still there
[0:50:56] NawtyTyme: ill level a cow priest again call it holymilk
[0:50:59] lavitz24: fresh classic is
[0:51:01] chalupacabras: @averyjames_ my guild raid logs and then we all go play either SOD or Hardcore SF lol
[0:51:08] roflpotamus: your age
[0:51:09] JCRainFGC: everyone just min maxes at the end
[0:51:09] Medifaded: I thinks thats more getting older
[0:51:10] Ilove_togetwet: Ilove_togetwet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 6 month streak! if you ever need a prostate exam hit me up, i watched a couple youtube vids on the subject. keep it up champ

[0:51:13] jaiven99: -there was so much grind in cata
[0:51:13] averyjames_: @chalupacabras still playing tho lol
[0:51:14] Winttyrr: cata was hard
[0:51:15] lavitz24: fresh classic is fun for 2 months
[0:51:21] NawtyTyme: it has LFG and LFR
[0:51:22] gen7lem4n: cata was fun
[0:51:24] NawtyTyme: so casul
[0:51:31] nowheretoday: soniiKek
[0:51:35] gyeolsim: cata was what got me hooked to wow
[0:51:50] chalupacabras: I remember Cata Heroics being hell to heal
[0:51:51] Runb4ur2ghey: whats ur kilos today?
[0:51:53] Winttyrr: cata heroic dungeons and raids all the way through firelands were really hard @SONII
[0:51:56] chalupacabras: before they nerfed them
[0:52:00] direwolf575: soniiCook soniiCook soniiCook
[0:52:06] Slaughter13x: What song is that ???
[0:52:09] jaiven99: between reps. gear, raid, pvp if you wanted to experience the lot, and more kept coming out as each phase went by
[0:52:09] luzid7: they did a lot of things for casual like raid finder etc but casuals can't clear the raid thats the thing ^^
[0:52:12] Slaughter13x: Shits fire
[0:52:19] Winttyrr: yeah, i want the hard content again
[0:52:22] chalupacabras: omfg Firelands. doing that every week until we completed everyone's staff. KILL ME
[0:52:24] Medifaded: gaming gigachad
[0:52:25] Winttyrr: heroic rag was nutty
[0:52:28] NawtyTyme: humble brag
[0:52:28] jaiven99: had stuff like hyjal, molten front, defenders rep etc
[0:52:31] asloff: you ever play Lies of P?
[0:52:45] Breadpool62: mythic raid on retail
[0:52:47] jimg3: did that guy just offer to give u a protate examination lol xD
[0:52:47] erawin1990: arena?
[0:52:51] Lamspread: SoD is a cozy game
[0:52:55] Winttyrr: yeah thats why i play so many rogue likes
[0:52:56] Medifaded: haha, I agree. Its time consuming not challenging
[0:52:58] XDemon85: DayZ is super challenging cause you choose your own adventure.
[0:52:59] Slaughter13x: !song
[0:53:01] Winttyrr: they challenge me pretty well
[0:53:02] Medifaded: Hell Divers II is pretty hard
[0:53:05] gen7lem4n: internet and min/maxing ruined games
[0:53:12] Runb4ur2ghey: ue dat my brothatr
[0:53:15] roflpotamus: ye mythic retail is hard af/time consuming
[0:53:17] chalupacabras: @SONII would you want them to add heroic or somethjing more difficult to SOD?
[0:53:19] Gillbawk: elden ring?>
[0:53:24] Winttyrr: er, souls likes more so. i like rogue likes too
[0:53:26] Dalbo420: Mythic SoD
[0:53:33] ilovestarfire777: the only challenging thing in retail is the arcane mage rotation and dealing with the furries
[0:53:33] Eggzactly54: people dont want challenge anymore they just want finished. and first
[0:53:35] gen7lem4n: !music
[0:53:35] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxH2q9VhEXM
[0:53:36] Winttyrr: fromsoft games are my shit
[0:53:40] mart_york: I don’t have time to pug a raid and wipe. unless you respawn back on boss with full buffs and. consumes
[0:53:43] jaiven99: retail is challenging, when you move up in key levels or enter mythic raiding, less then 1% sees the mythic end bosses
[0:53:43] Eggzactly54: everything is a race
[0:53:50] Peschke9: I  beat malenia earlier
[0:53:51] bubblesthebelfwarrior: sup stud
[0:53:52] Dalbo420: @ilovestarfire777 The furries make it bearable
[0:53:52] Runb4ur2ghey: yea last 2 games you played were this and elden ring lol
[0:53:55] batchestspam: elden ring DLC soon Pog
[0:54:10] JCRainFGC: does challenging mean grindy?
[0:54:24] jaiven99: well only games that have a difficult curve across the game these days are souls games if you want it as an overall
[0:54:26] Peschke9: its a fun fight, i did it after i beat the game
[0:54:30] Peschke9: sucks sometimes tho
[0:54:31] Breadpool62: helldivers is hard af
[0:54:31] Medifaded: @SONII thats true but if you are saying things are too easy you can seek out mythic and harder games. I totally agree there are a lot of ez games out there specially WoW
[0:54:37] Astralthundr: difficult and casual fundamentally counter each other
[0:54:41] lavitz24: challenging is like cuphead
[0:54:43] Winttyrr: she says her name every time you fight here lol
[0:54:47] Winttyrr: her*
[0:54:50] Twitchful_Duelist: mage tower was the best retail content ive ever done
[0:54:52] Medifaded: I never palyed Legion
[0:54:52] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: bro that was
[0:54:54] Twitchful_Duelist: they should do that shit more often
[0:54:55] direwolf575: yeah boi
[0:54:55] Winttyrr: mage tower was so fucking good
[0:54:55] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: i still never got it
[0:54:57] SamULJackson: they were tough but so fun when you beat them
[0:54:58] Winttyrr: wow needs way more if it
[0:55:01] kensstv: if u had mage tower loot u were a chad
[0:55:03] charbosan: love magetower
[0:55:03] envy__gr: @SONII bro why do you look 8 years younger ?
[0:55:07] Astralthundr: mage tower was bad ass, got my enh shaman mace
[0:55:07] envy__gr: you shave ?
[0:55:08] Ilove_togetwet: mage tower...now thats a name i havent heard in some time
[0:55:10] Astralthundr: still use it
[0:55:12] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: yeah like impossible shit
[0:55:13] MeatyGorak: the transmog from mage tower was sooo good

[0:55:31] Winttyrr: solo challenges you cant jus outgear
[0:55:34] Selecktt: They were onto something neat with torghast. I liked the roguelike element. not super well implemented though

[1:01:28] NawtyTyme: ratJAM
[1:01:34] Medifaded: @skimansr yea its not based on optimum playing just how players are performing. So if you have a lot of weak players on a certain class its not super accuate. Still interesting IMO

[3:16:49] jeneraljelly: @cbaily7 If you dont get a raid slot find a new guild
[3:16:59] brandvarmbums: are u playing this for lack of better content or what is up?
[3:17:06] kigami_uro: did you change the sound bit?

[3:19:07] squidethics: why lol
[3:19:07] NawtyTyme: i though it was 80-85?
[3:19:08] brandvarmbums: thats crazy to me
[3:19:08] imgonnakaratefightyou: Weird
[3:19:10] ponez: who the fuck plays WOD LMAO
[3:19:13] ponez: serialkillers
[3:19:13] deathdemonic99: WOD was ass
[3:19:14] PandaBearMe: cata classic could be cool but pvps so dead
[3:19:15] gentlesoaps: ashran slapped
[3:19:16] squidethics: I cant wait for WoW TBC classic classic
[3:19:19] talbybucketz: legion was awesome
[3:19:25] deathdemonic99: legion was cool
[3:19:25] bubblesthebelfwarrior: cata? gross
[3:19:25] averyjames_: WOD was fun pvp wise
[3:19:31] soapbargoeshard: when do you think wow went to shit
[3:19:39] veiloflonelystars: wod would have been much better remembered if we didnt get fucking garrisons
[3:19:39] tmacd: yeah legion was good my favorite
[3:19:49] Akileys: TBC
[3:19:55] KairuruTV: wotlk for sure
[3:19:57] nowheretoday: When Activision took over
[3:20:07] JokiGhostCrew: When did u quit Retail=
[3:20:09] JokiGhostCrew: ?
[3:20:10] KairuruTV: wotlk made the pivot from being an mmo to a lobby game imo
[3:20:11] ponez: slow decline started after ICC and at WoD it was on lifesupport
[3:20:12] Jxrdanre: vanilla was the downfall Chatting
[3:20:14] squidethics: what really
[3:20:18] squidethics: MoP for me
[3:20:24] veiloflonelystars: early tbc was def difernt from late tbc
[3:20:25] imgonnakaratefightyou: Wrath was the beginning of the end.
[3:20:30] Absynne: Nah TBC was the pinnacle of PvP for me
[3:20:39] JoeBangles_: https://wowclassic.blizzard.com/en-us/#beta?blzcmp=blizzard-news
[3:20:43] Shailax: i started in bfa im waiting on bfa classic tbh
[3:20:45] JoeBangles_: for anyone who needs link to opt in
[3:20:48] just_varick: yeah. going forward wrath was really fun, but looking back it was where they started to abandon the mmo
[3:20:56] KairuruTV: what made TBC and WotLK still work originally as that there was still the majority of the playerbase leveling from level 1 so the whole world was populated
[3:21:05] deathdemonic99: US where is the EU link
[3:21:40] brandvarmbums: yeah wotlk naxx made me quit
[3:21:43] KairuruTV: @SONII everyone touts wotlk as being huge for population; however, people refuse to remember that it was also the first time wow started to LOST pop
[3:21:51] Shailax: i think no xpack will hit the same as were no longer 15
[3:21:57] nowheretoday: They could've at least give you a set of heirlooms
[3:22:13] jamesplitter14: ulduar overrated, same as black temple
[3:22:29] tmacd: swtor
[3:22:30] fanniclap: I drifted to rift for a bit
[3:22:41] deathdemonic99: swtor was fun
[3:22:43] just_varick: swtor launch was fun. janky af but fun
[3:22:49] tmacd: it was great in the beginning
[3:22:49] averyjames_: SOO annd TOT was fub
[3:22:49] MattOriginal: SWTOR is still active
[3:22:51] averyjames_: fun
[3:22:55] zdogbroski: swtor was fun but didnt have enough behind it to keep it alive
[3:22:58] kigami_uro: I had a lot of fun with wildstar
[3:22:59] Duokkis: Lord of the rings online Pog
[3:23:01] fanniclap: You said tht once and I couldnt agree more
[3:23:05] nowheretoday: I played GW2 beta
[3:23:06] Less_CW: bet the riot mmo will be like that
[3:23:07] Astralthundr: RIFT was awesome!
[3:23:07] squidethics: pull a palworld lol
[3:23:08] Alpacabuns: rift was legit fun with the world events
[3:23:11] just_varick: I really liked the rift beta but kept playing wow lol
[3:23:15] tmacd: the best was Star Wars galaxies
[3:23:23] Shailax: wow copied everyone else now its time for wow to get copied
[3:23:23] tmacd: before the nge
[3:23:30] ShiNe_o: i liked wildstar
[3:23:34] Zealos_: @SONII I firmly believe Riot is going to give Blizz a run for their money when they release their MMO.
[3:23:36] Selecktt: something about wow combat hasnt been replicated. every other mmo feels very floaty in comparison
[3:23:39] squidethics: warhammer was so much fun
[3:23:45] squidethics: warhammer pvp was peak
[3:23:50] Less_CW: warhammer was buggy af on release. didnt feel smooth
[3:23:50] fanniclap: wow combat just has such a good flow
[3:23:51] fuchai: FF14 came out in Cata as well
[3:23:58] veiloflonelystars: it's lighting in a box
[3:23:59] soapbargoeshard: thoughts on warhammer 40k
[3:24:03] nowheretoday: The combat fluidity
[3:24:08] just_varick: yea, every other game has some kinda jank. literally how the characters move / interact with the world
[3:24:12] imgonnakaratefightyou: There was a Conan MMO too.
[3:24:23] Shailax: wow combat is goated
[3:24:30] Shailax: thats 1 thing it has going for itself
[3:24:34] miciahclay: If only New World hadn't been so buggy and had an end game. The PvP was a lot of fun there
[3:24:40] Selecktt: I think it's the animations. Wow animations will clip each other and everything is instant. Other games try to make the animations match the damage. Looks better, feels worse.
[3:24:47] Brewslav1: @sonii how much did you play of Cataclysm?
[3:24:50] Beezer91: i quite liked that wildstar when it first came out, didn't get far in it but died quickly i think
[3:24:51] fuchai: FF14 now is actually legit good now. They really stepped up the combat
[3:24:51] deathdemonic99: age of conan was nice i liked it
[3:24:54] deathdemonic99: necromancer was lit
[3:25:02] fanniclap: I remember my brother playing final fantasy on playstation i think? I accidently saved over his profile and I hid under the dining room table for like an hour
[3:25:12] NawtyTyme: i got it so ez
[3:25:14] NawtyTyme: wow
[3:25:26] veiloflonelystars: Sadge
[3:25:32] NawtyTyme: ur just not a grinder
[3:25:40] deathdemonic99: i got a fucking ad just as u talked about the sword sadge lost the story
[3:25:59] PEGA5USs: greqat song
[3:26:13] fuchai: i got the mount from Arch using the exploit that was happening
[3:26:18] nathanieldaniel_: so hyped for cata honestly
[3:26:33] averyjames_: thats in wotlk
[3:26:40] just_varick: biggest miss for me is the new items are all weird like bodysuit garbage
[3:26:41] Brewslav1: Pvp in Cata came to balance closer than any other expansion imho
[3:26:43] just_varick: in cata
[3:26:47] Zehmox: hows the beta
[3:26:49] veiloflonelystars: sod + cata, we will be eating good for whole year
[3:26:52] nowheretoday: Got any achievements yet lol
[3:26:54] deathdemonic99: kek kinda early to add zulian panthe
[3:26:56] deathdemonic99: panther
[3:26:57] imgonnakaratefightyou: Did you like the underwater zone in Cata?
[3:27:03] Astraea013: yoo
[3:27:09] just_varick: like all the leveling stuff looks like you're wearing a onesie
[3:27:11] PandaBearMe: soni when are u going to ironforge gym?
[3:27:15] Shailax: isnt war within comin out in august?
[3:27:16] Heartofc: why does this leveling feel slower than vanilla lmao
[3:27:29] veiloflonelystars: 100%
[3:27:31] just_varick: I actually loved Vashj'ir
[3:27:38] veiloflonelystars: its because people only think of dragon soul
[3:27:39] KairuruTV: it was like that with a lot of xpaks that were actually VERY good, but they remember how it ended
[3:27:47] zdogbroski: DEATH=DELETE
[3:27:51] Selecktt: First ever Cata HC clip right there
[3:28:01] just_varick: Launch day jumping in the water and just everyone swimming around and killing eachother. Bloodbath. So much fun
[3:28:15] ponez: so, whres the Sonyfrontal cataclysm guide
[3:28:17] deathdemonic99: cata hc lets go
[3:28:24] NawtyTyme: no thats u just giving up early
[3:28:41] bubblesthebelfwarrior: no rune needed

[3:29:21] nowheretoday: Beta test it
[3:29:23] kigami_uro: tester Sonii!
[3:29:31] aeozora: Is this Cata beta?
[3:29:37] veiloflonelystars: i can't wait to see people lose their shit to how good arena feels to play in cata
[3:29:40] soapbargoeshard: 10%
[3:29:47] veiloflonelystars: and rbgs
[3:29:51] aeozora: V rush at lvl 5 is huge
[3:29:56] averyjames_: whats the #1 pvp class in cata chat?
[3:29:58] ponez: was rbgs in catty :o

[3:30:09] KombatWombat07: im ready to try cata with the new changes coming
[3:30:09] MattOriginal: Cata is gonna be my main game for sure.  Dope raids, dope PVP, such a good expansion.
[3:30:14] GregWasTaken: my lvl 80 shammy in LK will farm u
[3:30:15] ponez: oh wow, rbgs were fun AF
[3:30:16] Ranzorx: at this point id rather play cata than sod
[3:30:25] ragnof_: i wish it was cata classes and arena, with og zones. new questing kinda spoonfed
[3:30:36] Ranzorx: cata has real pvp
[3:30:40] squidethics: i wanna play cata just to be a belf
[3:30:43] Shailax: do u oom in cata or nah?
[3:30:52] imgonnakaratefightyou: I like SoD
[3:30:57] ragnof_: sod 60 is gonna be the tits

[3:31:04] Ranzorx: warrior in sod is depressing
[3:31:05] veiloflonelystars: 50-60 is where it will be at
[3:31:09] ragnof_: 100%
[3:31:23] nerrskar: pve arms war clears
[3:31:25] Ranzorx: warrior is disgusting in cata
[3:31:41] walkingded23: i feel warrior is less op in cata. well atelast from pvp private servers
[3:31:45] veiloflonelystars: cata is more developed than wrath...
[3:31:46] ragnof_: just seems.... unneeded. retail has all these quests
[3:31:48] KairuruTV: pvp was pretty decent in cata if i remember right
