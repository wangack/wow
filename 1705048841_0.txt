[2:12:26] YinYangMan77: exploding demon
[2:12:27] Molvonos: The weird demon summon thing
[2:12:38] Molvonos: Throw a glaive and if it hits, it explodes.
[2:12:39] Stoops21: necrolord ability
[2:12:40] Velonna: at the start of DF, Fodder would accidentally crit heal you for 300k. It was insane
[2:12:42] ThePawPaw: @Prevention6 its remind me of old old school like in 90s pirate game on SEGA if you know the game but yeah idk what is happening
[2:12:57] akia03: necrolord thing wasnt it
[2:12:59] YinYangMan77: throw glaive one-shots the demon

[2:24:52] BullDevil: All tanks should have lust and all healers should have brez. Change my mind.
[2:24:57] jasonicusm4: make it like the Engineering rez. someone has to play the drums for 2-3 seconds to activate the Lust. lol
[2:24:57] DBtheAlien: Dumb question, how do you get the tier sets?
[2:25:02] Masqerader: if gives u gold
[2:25:18] opalwinfrey: also resto shammy being one of the few healers who have mostly hard cast spells... compared to everyone else who pops instant cooldowns for big heals

[2:26:20] anekdotin: SHaman also is built for people to stay in one spot and stack and wow in 2023 is about fast movement.  Shaman has long healing spells
[2:26:21] CrusaderNero: niiiiiice
[2:26:25] Scarhearth: @jenfinite if a resto shaman is beating out a resto druid and holy priest in raid sorry but thats a bad druid and priest resto druids are far above every healer in most situations besides evokers
[2:26:26] ActasTV: i wait until u can craft then
[2:26:27] Sollice: Because blood lust is suppose to be a class identity spell. You give it to everyone and your going to have an even harfder funnel to specific tanks

[2:30:43] ashwing_: It also does aeo dmg
[2:30:49] Sollice: Everyone though it was going to be good for Havoc because it got buffed but it ended up being not so good
[2:30:50] BullDevil: @masqerader it’s supposed too, known bug
[2:31:29] Masqerader: @BullDevil its been broke since SL, shit never 1 shots explosive either

[2:47:05] TakeThatBack: I use a macro that targets the demon ids, but for tank I just cleave it down unless you need him dead
[2:47:14] spidersrskary: you DONT want a macro to kill the demon bc you do way more dmg if you ricochet the glaive off a diff target
[2:47:18] Prevention6: maintenance today? dang I was about to log in

[2:59:22] WaverlyP15: i feel you on the 90 min key, but its different when its because of mechanics or lack of effort, rather than jjust getting dunked on
[2:59:40] maxxstackzzx: Ima a 390 il resto Druid and can heal this easy if everyone does mechanics
[2:59:48] Tinit5190: Healer hasn't done a key above 10 so a 14 AV is a rough go
[2:59:50] paulson14: @Towelliee  Don't worry server reset will save you 23 mins
[2:59:52] mavericks312: jade temple was so ass last week with tyrannical

[3:06:31] Inthezonewow: Yeah Thundering has made me not wanna try high level M_
[3:06:31] YinYangMan77: They'd be, once again, admitting to a failure in design.
[3:06:32] nomithergaming: thundering fun
[3:06:35] Tinit5190: Nah
[3:06:36] WaverlyP15: @mavericks312 kinda what I've been noticing, the people that got carried are now geared to do it, and by no means am I an uber gamer, but i watch videos and pathing for all these just to make sure im not the reason we die as the tank
[3:06:39] Dcarter: Thundering is a shit affix
[3:06:42] mavericks312: @Scarhearth nah bro fuck prideful lol
[3:06:44] Dcarter: One of the worst ever
[3:06:47] Tinit5190: Thunder is a lot better than that 20% affix bullshit
[3:06:48] Dcarter: EVER
[3:06:51] fistofnature: worse than S2 of BFA ?
[3:06:54] MFAM_THE_Steven: oh no they wont finish the key due to holy pally and server shutdown... ol
[3:06:55] Masqerader: clear, get buff and win that would have been the better option
[3:06:57] MFAM_THE_Steven: lol*
[3:06:59] WaverlyP15: thundering does suck
[3:06:59] Thorkiil: Thundering is so easy tho

[3:07:15] mavericks312: @waverlyp15 before i touched anything above a 10 i watched videos on how to handle thundering
[3:07:17] Dcarter: They better look at this and realize don’t ever do shit like this again
[3:07:23] MFAM_THE_Steven: Blizz hard @Towelliee talkin shit do they're shutting the servers down
[3:07:24] Nasilvera: hmm server shutdown
[3:07:27] mavericks312: prideful was the worse affix
[3:07:29] WaverlyP15: @Thorkiil if you have people with dbm that call it out lol
[3:07:39] Bayne77: maintenance this morning?
[3:07:41] Scarhearth: @mavericks312 I'll say it again after having healed a grievous prideful... Shit was EASIER than this stupid pug killer affix
[3:07:44] Ariaeterna: FeelsStrongMan
[3:07:46] mavericks312: i think ppl who hate thundering are in the minority
[3:08:03] Kestrella444: some servers, like mine are janky
[3:08:17] Masqerader: Prideful would be a lot better now because you don't have ass bosses like hakkar
[3:08:21] Exodeo_: jinxed
[3:08:21] akia03: the bfa one with the aoe packs was fun
[3:08:21] Kestrella444: went weird on me yesterday
[3:08:44] WaverlyP15: @mavericks312 same, its easy, but that hgasnt really been the killer for me its people just not knowing genral boss mechanics or mob mechanics
[3:08:47] Inthezonewow: SL S4 was best seasonal affix
[3:08:51] Kestrella444: lost half the NPCs in Korthia, as example
[3:09:03] Scarhearth: Thundering shouldve been a theres lieutenant mobs in the dungeon at certain points you kill it and get a aoe circle ring doing pulsing damage. BOOM affix that everyone wouldve loved
[3:09:18] YinYangMan77: Pop off
[3:09:25] Aquadriel: bwonsamdi affix was lame, just mindless aoe and no benefit. just a time spender
[3:09:32] mavericks312: @waverlyp15 see at that point its players who id 0 dungeons or heroics leveling up and got by in 0s and low keys just winging it
[3:09:35] Itshiko: are you enjoying DragonFlight more than BFA?
[3:09:49] mavericks312: @waverlyp15 i still have to call out to groups in SMBG to kill adds on the 3rd boss
[3:10:11] WaverlyP15: @mavericks312 oh god yes
[3:10:13] Scarhearth: @Inthezonewow Nahhhh SL s3 and BFA S4
[3:10:16] nomithergaming: or intterupt death bolt Kekw
[3:10:20] theDirtyon3: bold take cotton
[3:10:40] WaverlyP15: @mavericks, i had toi teach 3 people in a +11 the mechanics
[3:10:45] mavericks312: i just think were in a new day were grinds are wanted/needed
[3:10:49] WaverlyP15: +11 NO
[3:10:51] Draz3nx: there are way less players than bfa imo
[3:11:13] AWreal: I would love to play BFA shadow priest right now
[3:11:19] Scarhearth: encrypted was a fun affix Urh and Vy relics made for some insanely fast tyrannical boss kills
[3:11:21] Tyr7: shutdown in 10m
[3:11:27] mavericks312: @waverlyp15 no pug healer i ran with on NO knew to grab 10 stacks of the orbs on the 2nd boss im just like how sway
[3:11:28] Prevention6: someone in my guild said they miss the simplicity of the talent rows and it made me sad to read
[3:11:52] mavericks312: @Prevention6 did you ask him if he was 15 lol
[3:11:56] Doohzyy: server shutdown monkaS
[3:11:56] Inthezonewow: @Scarhearth Was s3 the one with the 3adds? That was cool. SL4 was my favourite because you only had to remember to speak to an NPC LUL
[3:11:58] Sazuret: Ive heard shroud say he doesnt like dragonriding and wants the old one back LUL
[3:12:07] Ammunn: is that cursor thing an addon or weakaura? my weakaura has a bit of lag

[3:12:28] strchsr: @Towelliee You doing more after that and want a 402 spriest?
[3:12:38] Prevention6: @mavericks312 no I think they were just a super casual who logs on to do world quests only lol
[3:12:44] Sazuret: @mavericks312 True LUL i mean he was doing 20s earlier
[3:12:53] Masqerader: who cares what shroud wants?  Shroud also said Mixer would be bigger than Twitch and look how that turned out
[3:12:54] Itshiko: @Sazuret does he even play wow anymore? I haven't been paying attention
[3:12:59] Scarhearth: @Inthezonewow yeah that was with the 3 adds. Urh relic would make it so you had 100% CDR for 15 seconds and you would  see tyrannical bosses melt within a minute on a 17
[3:13:09] WaverlyP15: @mavericks312 so instant death, my group kept stacking grabbin orbs around me instead of letting them hit me in the back, and then wouldnt spread anough to get zapped
[3:13:15] mavericks312: @Sazuret he also had max raid lead his normal VoTi
[3:13:32] mavericks312: @Prevention6 well that makes perfect sense lol

[3:45:43] Trafikk_: 240K + on EU
[3:45:56] chriswrites: are people buying ilegal gold?
[3:45:58] ProPaineTheThird: its cause the work order system and all the "ways" to make gold are being capitalized by the people who spend 12 hours a day farming mats and shit and work to be the "sole" providers of the lariat
[3:46:01] Incredible_Sausage: servers not going down?
[3:46:04] Sweet_Lou__: a WoW token should not go under 200K gold. insane
[3:46:07] Trafikk_: for WoW token

[3:48:31] Talason: people need gold to craft
[3:48:38] Talason: gear is hard to come by
[3:48:38] yadungoofed101: gold lowers the more people buying token with $$
[3:48:43] Strik3r019: very good for me, i can play for free
[3:48:43] Masqerader: if u wanna get diablo 4 cheap with just gold its a good thing
[3:48:44] WickedSorrow: When the token is low, it means there's more tokens on the AH than there is demand for them.
[3:48:44] SilkeySmooth: blizzard trying to cut down on run sells?
[3:48:54] captain_khyzan: if tokens are cheap.... it means there is a heavy supply of them, meaning more sellers then buyers
[3:48:58] Talason: if there was no crafting this expansion i would be screwed because i have bad rng on loot
[3:49:02] TheGamerME: what size is that bottle your drinking from

[3:49:07] Yagr6: i can max bows and people are only giving me 10k per bow
[3:49:13] mavericks312: the hogwarts game is gonna be a no for me
[3:49:20] Mecabeast: morning hammer squad found out from a guildys ticket the disbands seem to be the fault of some addons interfering with chat functions.
[3:49:21] Aegllor: The price of the tokens has to do with supply and demand. The more people buy the more are on the market and therefore that drives the price down.
[3:49:24] fynnswow: it's a shame jk rowling is a pos terf and will make money from it
[3:49:34] sinlesssinner: is it on xbox live? Harry Potta game?
[3:49:43] cptrogers123: Nothing makes me wanna quit the game more when people leave on last boss in m+ @Towelliee

[3:52:23] TheGamerME: Shes entilted to that opion but were entitled not to like it or believe it
[3:52:23] Borders111: stop making sense
[3:52:24] Squirrel_nutty: guilty by assoiation
[3:52:27] 91Niki: People need to calm the fuck down and just let people enjoy things
[3:52:27] Borders111: lol
[3:52:27] thebakeriscomingforu: I think some of these people grew up with Harry Potter. Then they find the writer has certain beliefs. So those people feel betrayed? Either way they are to emotionally invested in it.

[3:52:47] Billo0w: @mavericks312 yes, idc about them honestly, even if its just a game, i dont want JK rowling to earn any money from me
[3:52:56] Sasorinor: it's still the most wishlisted game on steam, top 10 pre order on playstation... people can bitch on twitter all they want, it's not gonna change the fact it's a minority and the game will sell loads. rather enjoy the things you do

[3:53:08] TheGamerME: Don't forget how betrayed the players of DND feel as well :)
[3:53:09] fynnswow: harry potter game is probably similar to chikfila when it comes to buying/"supporting"
[3:53:21] Jango_: Glad we focus on what JK Rowling said instead of more important issues.
[3:53:29] fynnswow: hell to my knowledge, the developers fought to all all types of characters to be made in the game
[3:53:30] Jango_: this is why we are doomed

[3:54:28] canniik: Ah yes, lets penalise all of the hard working developers and designers cause the original concept came from someone whos views are different from ous.
[3:54:29] largefromage: LUL
[3:54:30] fake_kenpachi: the money spent on buying the game goes to WB... not JK, she has already been paid her royalties for the game...

[3:57:44] TheGamerME: test
[3:57:48] Densetsu_: fsgPog ban-hammer time
[3:57:52] Squirrel_nutty: quit bitching about a game ffs
[3:57:54] Keglett: They accidentally turned Heroic Rasz into Mythic last night, clouds didn't work at all.
[3:57:54] Jango_: @Incredible_Sausage lol
[3:57:57] fynnswow: @Molvonos what if toweliee keeps talking about it? hard to talk about the game without talking about the IP creator.
[3:58:00] Glisur85: @Dcarter We gonna run that 15 Temple later?
[3:58:07] Dcarter: Yessir
[3:58:09] xnumber15x: where would put this xpac in a tier list compared to others
[3:58:09] 91Niki: You can chat about the game all you want, but take the other shit elsewhere
[3:58:10] Molvonos: You can talk about the game and not talk about the bullshit behind it
[3:58:11] TheGamerME: na I'm good . so besides this hows everyone doing
[3:58:16] mavericks312: the real question is skull and bones ever gonna come out lol
[3:58:20] Raxxiety: the hammer you don't want in Towelliee's stream
[3:58:22] Molvonos: It's a real simple concept
[3:58:29] Sollice: @mavericks312 No

[4:00:00] Putcride: it got pushed but there will be a beta for people

[4:00:15] mavericks312: ubisoft dropping the ball witha possible big title game
[4:00:17] negxrevolution: Ubisoft as usually
[4:00:17] fynnswow: skull and bones focused way too hard on the ship aspect of black flag
[4:00:21] Havoc_S1: They dropped the ball with that game
[4:00:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pirate simulator
[4:00:26] Alienfromger: the question is... will it release before AOC?^^
[4:00:30] captain_khyzan: sea of thieves > skull and bones.... sorry no competition

[4:00:51] cptrogers123: I cant wait for the Witcher Remake with new graphics and all @Towelliee
[4:00:52] UlsterFarl: It's all about that Baldurs Gate 3 hype for me
[4:01:03] Prevention6: it always just looked like the ship combat from AC black flag but fleshed out into a whole game
[4:01:04] Incredible_Sausage: a good one
[4:01:09] Sollice: Good news. MS and Besthesda doing a show on the 25th
[4:01:10] cinamonjackz: has there been any update on arclight rumble @Towelliee
[4:01:10] CloudPants8081: delayed cooksuXEZ
[4:01:16] fynnswow: @Prevention6 that was the intent
[4:01:18] Molvonos: @Molvonos Eh, i'm pretty set with WoW, some D4 when that comes out and DRG.
[4:01:21] 8BitAron: There is a roumor that Xbox. is doing a Stream soon
[4:01:25] 8BitAron: Xbox Direct
[4:01:30] mavericks312: @Prevention6 mean that would make sense since its the same company
[4:01:31] zeiours: I wonder what the new ESO announcement is going to be @towelliee
[4:01:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Baldur's Gate 3 could be interesting
[4:01:40] fynnswow: DRG?
[4:01:42] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @innerkindd (warning)
[4:01:42] Molvonos: And whatever games we end up doing marathons/special events fod, lol

[4:01:52] Molvonos: Deep Rock Galactic - Diggy Holes w/ Dwarves in Space.
[4:02:02] Scarhearth: it was a 16 @Towelliee
[4:02:02] Sollice: @innerkindd No idea why that message was deleted lol
[4:02:05] Itshiko: OMG ITS SMAUG
[4:02:28] Molvonos: @Sollice Cause he repeated it twice within a minute span
[4:02:30] Sollice: Molv is going to be the only mod for D4 or we may need to get another. I know Niki, Gattz and I will be degening it
[4:02:33] cptrogers123: @Sollice NotLikeThis
[4:02:48] Jarlan23: i cant even get into a 16 on my dps warrior
[4:02:52] Molvonos: lol, i'll be degenning it too.  I have three monitors, I can multitask.
[4:02:54] 91Niki: @Sollice Gattz can't afford to take time off for it. So idk that he will
[4:02:57] Jarlan23: wish i had a group to run with but all pugs
[4:03:00] ArchMystery: this a viewer M+ or he expects his group to watch his stream?
[4:03:03] Molvonos: I play Necro, Sol.  I let the game play itself for me, lol
[4:03:07] Sollice: WHAT @91Niki OUR PLAN BEING RUINED!

[4:03:25] cptrogers123: @Molvonos Is the ultimate Discord mod/twitch mod KEKW
[4:03:27] 91Niki: @Sollice Yeah money situation is tight. Can't afford time off sadly :(
[4:03:39] brooklynitetv: @Towelliee Anyone tell you that you have a radio voice?
[4:03:48] Sollice: :( Well I will degen it with whomever wants to do it with me
[4:03:59] Molvonos: @innerkindd Psh, it's a group effort.  Every mod here's just as fantastic.
[4:04:03] kiwimeister13: damm i got a alchemical flavor pocket from the feast yesterday

[4:06:20] g0n_z3n: I love kayaking, live right near a 4000 acre nature preserve
[4:06:31] Sollice: @Sollice That sounds nice. We have a big lake by Katies parents. I wanna buy some jet ski's
[4:06:33] Dox023: Would you not recommend tanking on brewmaster then?
[4:06:42] cptrogers123: Yo Blood dk is banging in keys tho @Towelliee

[4:12:54] 91Niki: They only had 1 flavor in stock tho. Guava. So grabbed that one
[4:12:54] WickedSorrow: That green on green is almost impossible for some color blind people to see at all @Towelliee
[4:12:56] pbnj_kills: theres a lot of stuff like that in dragonflight it seems
[4:12:57] Mecabeast: can we stop having swirling be similar colors to the floor k thanks
[4:13:02] TheGamerME: @91Niki  ha well welcome to maine hope you enjoy your stay.
[4:13:22] 91Niki: @TheGamerME Thanks haha! The nature is stunning :D
[4:13:39] Molvonos: Those gummies are pretty cheap all things considered.
[4:13:55] s7wede: I wish Blizzard would have a standard element design template for harmful and helpful spells that you could turn on in the options menu. Having to guess on the floor what stuff is safe to stand in can quickly lead to frustration
[4:14:08] TheGamerME: special gummies ?
[4:14:15] Molvonos: Yea, ADV sells gummies now.
[4:14:21] PvtHudson093: witness me
[4:14:32] Molvonos: They're not THC gummies tho, actual health/vitamin/etc ones.
[4:14:38] TheGamerME: like thc filled gummies ?
[4:14:41] 91Niki: @Towelliee I think somebody must have found some CHILL tubs laying around somewhere LUL Cuz they were out of stock forever, and I happened to check last week and they had Guava flavor in stock. So I ordered one tub
[4:14:45] TheGamerME: Ok
[4:14:54] 91Niki: @Molvonos Wait really??
[4:14:58] DuhCasual: This is a towelliee or community question: I enjoy playing a tank but main heals. Do you think its true that a tanking spec is the hardest and one should indulge unless prepared to study the dungeons and not be more casual?
[4:15:22] Molvonos: https://advanced.gg/collections/boost
[4:15:29] 91Niki: Thanks!
[4:15:58] TheGamerME: ahhh like a gaming gummie?
[4:16:07] 91Niki: Yeah I'm having issues falling asleep lately. Brain running 100 miles an hour. Hoping come CBD can put a lid on the fast running brain. So can't wait for that tub to come in
[4:16:11] fynnswow: @gGhote depends how hard you wanna go/how high. Tanking LFR is easy, but there's still tank specific mechanics so it's good to know stuff.
[4:16:28] WaverlyP15: @gGhote as a tank yes, i think more studying is required than other roles, if you want to be a good tank
[4:16:30] fynnswow: @gGhote if you're just gaming to game, play dps. All you do is push buttons and dodge things. :)
[4:16:40] TheGamerME: for health  gummies?

[5:28:13] WaverlyP15: ditch the crit on shockwave if its purely for utility
[5:28:35] hadusii: @Towelliee Its a player diff when it comes to interrupts.
[5:28:40] WaverlyP15: i know but so does roar

[5:34:32] Exodeo_: I don't even know how to make gold atm tbh
[5:34:36] Bowwjack: @Towelliee pretty sure that the server issues are because of blizzard back loging all of the character data from the chineese servers so that when the netease thing hits they can just launch their on chineese live servers.
[5:34:39] redspike15: that's an ez 22k gold in your bags pog
[5:34:40] drmabusee: those runes are my only income right now lol

[5:37:03] WaverlyP15: that would make sense,
[5:37:12] PvtHudson093: nah Tencent is gonna take over
[5:37:17] thebakeriscomingforu: hmm, not sure that is how that works with China. Think Blizz needs a new partner there.
[5:37:28] FarmerNappy: they cant launch in china on their own
[5:37:49] drhoser: I'm only a heroic raider but busted my face against Dalthea last night.  Adds freecasting the buff to 30 stacks...
[5:38:02] luckfore: i hate that few seconds of game freezing on the loading screen and enetering the world when you first launch the game

[5:51:50] captain_khyzan: @m0uszy to hard track cuz if 1 person leaves... the other 4 are forced to leave, unless there is a way to track first leaver

[5:52:26] Molvonos: It's a real simple concept: dont be an asshole.
[5:52:36] strchsr: @Towelliee Imagine if there was a system like in FFXIV where you could vote to abandon the dungeon, and if you don't use it and leave before a certain amount of time you get a deserter debuff
[5:53:01] GingerGambit: Ret was already good and they got buffed
[5:53:13] m0uszy: @captain_khyzan also gotta make sure DC's caused by game bugs doesnt affect the % tracked either

[5:54:07] stratiss: ret was good before the buffs too lol

[5:54:20] PvtHudson093: the buffs helped a lot
[5:54:24] WhiteKnight74648: Yeah they slap hard. i wish they had more mobilty or else I play one
[5:54:29] Spicy_Curryy: Ret gang fo life
[5:54:30] TheFox0228: Ret after the buffs a couple days ago feel REALLY good to play, despite feeling a bit clunky
[5:54:37] ESO_HYPE: @aftercovid yeah indeed, I started DF as evoker healer but quickly went back to my fire mage cus of the toxic comments.
[5:54:39] Maxoru0: the buffs made a huge improvement
[5:54:41] YinYangMan77: Ret's problem isn't damage
[5:54:45] WaverlyP15: @surdent think it was the pre xpac nerfs that scared everyone
[5:54:48] YinYangMan77: Hasn't been for awhile
[5:54:57] PvtHudson093: SoV on a min CD with talents is nice
[5:54:58] Maxoru0: towComfy towLove
[5:55:24] Spicy_Curryy: @YinYangMan77 mobility and survival. dam has always been good. I am biased though
[5:55:25] WaverlyP15: @ESO_HYPE im sorry that happened to you
[5:55:37] citrinesoan: PogChamp
[5:55:52] citrinesoan: Squid2 Squid1 Squid4
[5:57:11] YinYangMan77: @YinYangMan77 Right.  Mobility, survivability (addressed a bit with SoV), and spec inefficiency.  And as they stated themselves, a lot of buttons just don't feel fun to press.
[5:57:13] WaverlyP15: i like that youve been hamstinging, did it help in NO when i said it?
[5:57:41] shiftfazed: only a 19
[5:57:47] PvtHudson093: Any Rets just stopped using Exo?

[5:59:32] WaverlyP15: was about to ask how you do this pull, always seems like a giant shit show when i run this, but always works out

[6:59:58] jerkass: Does that work? I'm sure blizz will cuck us to have currency capped by bnet account

[7:00:27] WaverlyP15: @Fortvila holy hell would that be nice, but i understand why they do it
[7:00:41] dreamwalker213: @dandeneaux I believe there’s a quick quest to get your charge, kinda like sparks. No currency
