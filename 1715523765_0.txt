[0:46:33] AVERYdrinksWATER: @lucasinyo always worth it
[0:46:35] bubbashepherd: @ta1fun0 sure but that is really casual and arcadey compare to this, no tickets, Quick spawns etc
[0:46:36] qwinachine: hell let loose is literally a 180¬∞ turn away from how squad feels....
[0:46:39] macleodwins: how can you tell if people are on your team or enemy?

[0:49:57] bubbashepherd: @ta1fun0 i dont get that in hll because there are no tickets, and u spawn quick agian so

[0:50:28] BARTtheGull: bruh lmao
[0:50:45] CosmicEvo: it also depends on what squad you join. sometimes you get in the squad that's capturing points, other times you get in one that defends and doesn't see a lot of action and you just shoot the shit with your boys
[0:50:50] Serejke_qq: Stare
[0:50:54] ta1fun0: @bubbashepherd Well everyone experiences games different. But there's no better alternative for squad in ww2 setting that hll in my opinion with the player base that these 2 games actually has.

[0:51:18] BARTtheGull: @Apyrexia_ eyoo desert maps best
[0:51:20] gutter54: the worst are the silent squads, it sucks when nobody is talking. comms are such a big part of the game.

[0:51:55] ta1fun0: @gutter54 I myself took the role of squad leading it's not an easy task but if you achieve what you're trying to achieve it's so rewarding.
[0:52:00] dontpanicmyfragsrorganic: @zait159 yeah I stream and teach people everyday.   6k hours in Squad, 2 time world champion and I will get you comfortable with the game

[0:55:24] ta1fun0: @Picerusonix Dude it's not COD, people actually care here for deaths because they're costly and everything depends on tickets, you don't save them you lose.

[0:55:34] mattanire: its a team based game your just being a nuisance by wasting lives lmao @Picerusonix
[0:55:38] CrowFlies00: @Picerusonix if everyone thought that when they died, this game would been over 5mins ago. Every death takes a ticket
[0:55:38] BeLuffy: does*
[0:55:42] yungstall1on: @picerusonix and then if 10 more people have that mentality then you lose the game
[0:55:50] BARTtheGull: @BeLuffy you dont know

[0:56:35] WunderFlicker: did shroud top frag brah
[0:56:39] dontpanicmyfragsrorganic: @justgreez_ Squad runs off of a ticket based system similar to battlefield. By running out of tickets, your team loses

[0:59:58] tisonjr101: true'
[1:00:03] FRANTICjk: not easy to stream snipe in a sense becaue you die fast, no fast respawns, lots of teammates around you , needing game knowledge to maneuver the terrain properly etc.

[1:05:08] ItsJustKuma: @kambingkecil1 ive NEVER seen anything regarding cheating in this game. No leaderboards or anything so i think its just not appealing for cheaters
[1:05:12] ron1n76: what game mode is this?
[1:05:17] zait159: update for better performance or will it make it harder to run?
[1:05:17] ItsJustKuma: Wait Squad is going to DX12?!?!?
[1:05:23] BARTtheGull: @Lavancer this is everything exept sweaty
[1:05:23] justgreez_: does 3060 a good match for 5300 ?
[1:05:25] qwinachine: last time they did a performance update they forgot all the performance stuff in the next update and game ran like shit for over 2 years now
[1:05:27] iam_akaria: dudes stuck in vietnam vibes
[1:05:29] shixznit: @DefiantDota still a lot of poppin servers

[1:06:17] brodycanuck: HUH
[1:06:20] Seraphim343: @ItsJustKuma the devs also take reports incredibly serious, so cheaters don't last long either way. I've seen a profile with a manual ban from them
[1:06:38] qwinachine: @BARTtheGull i used to get over 130fps on a fx-8350... then upgraded to ryzen 5600x and have the same fps now...
[1:06:41] Lavancer: @BARTtheGull I got about 400 hours in it. It definitely can be. Stupidly tactical slow pace gameplay depending on the servers you're playing on.
[1:06:43] Enki90_: Yeah I've never seen a cheater in squad
[1:06:44] zait159: are their things you can do to make performance better for this game, have only 40 fps
[1:06:49] BakinPacman: the comms are godly
[1:06:52] BARTtheGull: @tabrexs nope, it will move up to more up to date UE4 releases but no plans for UE5 yet
[1:06:53] shixznit: @ItsJustKuma depends on the servers. played on a server where we get instantly wiped
[1:07:05] Helios_01: YEH the comms are really good
[1:07:05] linKcs_: watching this game brings me nostalgic feelings of Battlefield 2
[1:07:11] iijonesyy: Good comms on this game is so satisfying to me idky
[1:07:13] shixznit: mods wants proof like wtf. how can you even get 80 fcking kills
[1:07:14] a_hyena_dobr: Ky
[1:07:21] justgreez_: chat, is 3060 a good match with 53600?
[1:07:21] jcrozz: @zait159 you can buy a $2000 GPU lmao
[1:07:28] iam_akaria: imagine giving info in any fps and dude responds "copy"
[1:07:29] tabrexs: @BARTtheGull, ah, i see shroudYEP

[1:08:23] Seraphim343: @hotpocketshurtaf if it works, it works. if not, it doesn't. coming from someone with it also. it's not for everyone but the only way you'll find out is by either giving it a try or assessing from gameplay video.
[1:08:24] theboob24: @JoyNotTaken sqyuad

[4:10:11] BlitzBeastt: true
[4:10:15] EagleEye1392: Tarkov is not a game, it‚Äôs digital CBT
[4:10:18] Suupra: i agree with the dude in the first comment on youtube, cycle would be cool for console gamers
[4:10:20] Glocksic: There can only be one game to rule them all.. Dark and Darker.
[4:10:21] rickybobbi_: @shroud are you going to try forspoken the 24th
[4:10:23] Aruk_Pt: did they fixed the shots not taking damage some times?

[4:10:28] Ayjayyy: its a fun game for sure
[4:10:29] BlitzBeastt: tarkov is a horror game
[4:10:31] StalkerMonolith: Tarkov audio LULW
[4:10:33] W0LFayame: Squads audio is AMAZING
[4:10:38] Chillgasm: i like the squad audio
[4:10:43] paradoxvs101: which game has the beswt audio?
[4:10:43] ayycen: tarkov only gives us an adrenaline rush cause we dont know what we're doing haha
[4:10:43] Mutepanda: Tarkov is just so over complicated for a video game.
[4:10:46] Chillgasm: Squad*
[4:10:49] EagleEye1392: Squad audio >
[4:10:52] noonangel: Do you still have a fat kawk

[4:11:08] CasualKev: it lacks immersion
[4:11:09] KappaFIN: gun fights in this game are fun
[4:11:09] ErsinBozkurtTV: worst audio award goes toooooo COD and Apex LUL
[4:11:13] gabrielfndz__: watch 2022 em uma musica by lucas inutilismo
[4:11:14] khatZalasphere: Too real?

[4:11:15] Glocksic: @lunknown21 Hunt def has some of the best Audio ever.
[4:11:16] NastyNateDoggy: Correct, it is the guns
[4:11:16] castanza: fake
[4:11:18] enamr: what makes tarkov good is how it makes you care about losing the loot, the cycle doesn't feel as high stakes
[4:11:19] RoG_JanGo: need more guns
[4:11:19] ayycen: all guns in the cycle kinda feel the same
[4:11:21] nibs018: shotgun overpowered
[4:11:23] qwinachine: the cycles gun are all PVE oriented and deal no dmg to players
[4:11:24] icecreamsoup: projectiles very slow
[4:11:25] joaozinauau: more gun variety
[4:11:27] KappaFIN: guns dont feel like a gun lol

[4:11:36] mr_muskrat_: shroud reacts Pog
[4:11:36] EagleEye1392: @mutepanda agreed. I love immersion mechanics and systems, but there‚Äôs a point where it goes to far and takes away from the fun.
[4:11:38] Chillgasm: Nerf guns lol
[4:11:44] joeccer: joeccer subscribed with Prime. 
[4:11:44] Dannylarr: the gunplay is very forgiving I found
[4:11:45] nibs018: yep nerf guns
[4:11:46] Megadut: I think there needs to be a objective that has to be done by working together with everyone that has spawned on the map, then after you complete it, you need to fight that person for the right to get it
[4:11:47] pedrobdoc: Tarkov is 70% stash space management and 30% gunfight
[4:11:48] WrecklessMH: you said before you thought the gunplay was too easy right?
[4:11:53] HackerPhobia205: gun feel like airsoft
[4:11:56] Megadut: an*
[4:12:01] CCL_SN3AK: CCL_SN3AK subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:12:05] JasSsSix: guns are not immersive enough
[4:12:06] MariopSerafim: the guns could be more agressive since the gameplay is fast
[4:12:07] Bold_Star: @Mutepanda that's what a lot of ppl love about it tho, it breaks the mould. Other AAA companies would never do a game so indepth, they just produce the same generic shit

[4:17:01] heeli0s: Hi, just curious have you ever played Destiny ?

[4:17:24] triplezro: are there any specific changes that u think have been horrible for tarky?
[4:17:27] iamziggybeatz: thoughts on contractors yesterday?  breachers is also like rainbow six in vr
[4:17:29] sk8chalifHD: the crazy dsync.
[4:17:31] BiggsRS: IMO current Tarkov audio is not what they meant for it to be, but they had to get the update released.  Hopefully some major fixes to it soon.
[4:17:32] ShatterxVeZ: KKonaW
[4:17:35] funktillidie: looking in the direction of someone then the audio makes it sound like they are behind you is so cool
[4:17:38] WrecklessMH: is audio a problem with current game engines or is it on the games themselves?
[4:17:42] cadbr150: @77xenopeltis damn üòî
[4:17:43] UnnKnOwnn21: Desync...

[4:18:37] APuddleOfPuppies: Oh god the community would freak out if they changed the Gamma in anyway, even though the game needs it
[4:18:42] WHeltti91: ladastRansu

[4:18:48] Pandomia: Did you see that the Spellbreak devs released a community version of the game so people can host servers and play
[4:18:50] Mogsor: @Ganongoat because people eat that shit up
[4:18:52] Chillgasm: NFT items are the future, with an open marketplace.
[4:18:52] CHR1XX: companies make games to sell, they usually do that by making the skill gaps smaller and smaller between players so they can have larger communities, that means unbalanced stuff for the most part

[4:31:18] Stanlec: budget and team size
[4:31:19] drbarber131: budget
[4:31:21] motley_ai: both
[4:31:23] Chillgasm: triple A is just like saying Mainstream..
[4:31:23] Soarlozer: both
[4:31:24] travalgar_lo4347: what ur thought on Sons of the Forest
[4:31:24] be9ns: AAA = theft nowadays
[4:31:26] Joroz: Then Star Citizen is what AAAAAAA ?
[4:31:27] sookblat: triple AAA battery
[4:31:28] YeOldTaurusKing: experiance int the game
[4:31:28] DeathPercy: $60 game better be AAA quality
[4:31:29] howyaben: Think it's time we change the definition
[4:31:30] C0smozero: mostly those that has big budget are the most known anyway
[4:31:30] UnnKnOwnn21: both
[4:31:31] ibrugal: fallout 76 is considered survival ? it was a AAA company and it sucked
[4:31:32] ElAyVee: the line is gone basically nowadays
[4:31:33] Soarlozer: basically resources which would be budget
[4:31:35] youknohu: dev size as well
[4:31:35] Rewdawakening: The two aren't synonymous... look at BF 2043
[4:31:36] retired_recipe: budget, you know advertisement, exposure etc etc
[4:31:38] ermaltopalli: YEP
[4:31:39] Elwyinnnnn: YEP
[4:31:41] Faders: Maybe Quality aswell
[4:31:42] SpinFireTV: AAA is budget builds with large team with funding
[4:31:43] C0smozero: EA,BLIZZARD,VALVE etc
[4:31:43] ElAyVee: I'd say the company, rather than budget
[4:31:44] dannyx27: AAA studio gets involved it will be micro transactions for everything and micro transactions will be first priority over game game play and map
[4:31:47] FullmetalKawk: no
[4:31:48] Rexxenexx: Dead Matter has been triple Z since the closed alpha TBH
[4:31:49] micalo18: when g303 se small ?
[4:31:50] clocknerYT: @shroud Can you explain why you prefer the Embody over the Aeron?
[4:31:50] sookblat: naw bsg underwater
[4:31:53] qrs_complex: BSG is small
[4:31:53] AIexander97: i guess this The term "AAA Games" is a classification used within the video gaming industry to signify high-budget, high-profile games that are typically produced and distributed by large, well-known publishers. These games often rank as ‚Äúblockbusters‚Äù due to their extreme popularity.
[4:31:53] MrLagzy: Triple-A game = Big developer with big budget.
[4:31:54] New_Primitive: that make a game for EVERYONE KEKW
[4:31:55] youknohu: @shroud Grounded is an example
[4:31:58] Amcham: its both, a big AAA company cant make an indi game by only letting a small team makeit
[4:31:59] travalgar_lo4347: what ur thought on Sons of the Forest
[4:32:05] Jinzok: AAA = normie games, with 60 hours of gameplay max
[4:32:05] citrussnake905: What do you call star citizen then? They have put tons into that game
[4:32:06] PrivateEXIST: Developers who have published triple A game before
[4:32:07] nz_benny: Rockstar games etc
[4:32:09] notarobotforreal: BSG uses Lada servers, so no AAA KEKW
[4:32:09] StreamElements: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[4:32:16] BiggsRS: I'd consider AAA to also have a portfolio of high quality successful games behind them.
[4:32:16] midzito: @C0smozero valve notoriously doesnt have a lot of devs
[4:32:24] WalterVchh: Are you planning playing pubg or apex anytime soon?
[4:32:24] VniedzwiedzV: yes only smalll studios can do it but Ukrainnian is hard like always to do it becouse they have a war right now and the dosent have a "budhet"...
[4:32:28] be9ns: @notarobotforreal well theres step 1 of netcode debugging lol
[4:32:29] half_n_half: Check out Ghost of Tabor VR
[4:32:29] CrushedT: dead matter the game that will never get out
[4:32:30] tiamant22: @shroud  look at callisto protocol spent 160 million for nothing ))
[4:32:35] Faders: didnt this dev team crumble and had to rebuild?
[4:32:38] DeathPercy: BSG makes a shit ton of money. Moved from AA to AAA
[4:32:45] Jinzok: That Office looks like it was just placed there for the footage
[4:32:47] the_JayDee: they Patch icarus every week. so much changes over the time. guess they love they're game...
[4:32:47] Ali_Toddo: Yo is it illegal if I shit on my neighbours lawn
[4:32:57] om3geh_: They added a new patch notes to their Twitter 3 days ago @shroud
[4:32:58] gb_eh: just got a stand up desk.. and dual monitor arms... need to tweak but better than before
[4:33:03] syaoran_ho: L4D zombies

[4:33:20] be9ns: @shroud Road to Vorstok is all we got
[4:33:28] arcbreeze: Hey should watch the Kira video on what happened to the company
[4:33:32] SpinFireTV: now is the qol cycle before it was a foundation being built
[4:33:33] Megadut: I don't see why the time programming wouldn't play a big part in considering it AAA. You could throw 10 million at something and spend less time. but 1 million and spend way more hours. it's all a time/money ratio
[4:33:33] ElAyVee: I think that's literally what happened.
[4:33:34] DeathPercy: @spookylock kickstarter originally
[4:33:35] sykes893: if you dont have money you dont have time to work on the game @shroud
[4:33:37] Faders: I want to see what "raw footage" The Day Before is gonna showcase this month
[4:33:40] roxlul: like dead island, restarting over and over
[4:33:42] Under_Growth: That's just because normally you don't see most of this super alpha stuff
[4:33:46] qrs_complex: Rust is the greatest survival of all time.
[4:33:49] iitsskyz: why do games only release in early access now and not just wait till they are fully ready to release a less buggy game
[4:33:51] Jinzok: @Jakehunter1000 kira destroys indie scammer KEKW
[4:33:55] jprosu: KEKW
[4:33:56] Ïû•Ìôç_: kekw
[4:33:57] Graphflicks: LUL CarlSmile
[4:33:59] Nick26u: KEKW

[4:34:12] NastyNateDoggy: PepeLaugh
[4:34:14] CaptainSmithey: looks like pubg with mountains
[4:34:15] phtephenc: @iitsskyz lack of funding

[4:34:58] syaoran_ho: ‚ÄúTrust me Bro‚Äù KEKW
[4:34:59] Nick26u: Madge
[4:35:00] MattRiizz: size does matters
[4:35:00] Under_Growth: a tiny map sucks for exploration
[4:35:02] formatmezz: fun matters
[4:35:02] be9ns: as a developer, its pretty blatantly honest they over promised and are now downsizing. expect a timeline of 6x of whatever they promise
[4:35:03] d0m1n83r: i think it matters
[4:35:07] ware_bear: map size and no interaction??
[4:35:09] edward_e_t: It does matter

[4:35:22] CaptainSmithey: it's the motion of the ocean
[4:35:22] subtoxiic: thats what she said

[4:35:25] solomonwtf: does size matter
[4:35:29] qrs_complex: COPIUM
[4:35:29] xsc4rsx: it does a little bit, just don't want a cod mp size map
[4:35:29] DezignedDifferent: namalsk is best map and its tiny
[4:35:30] RenegadeGSs: content density matters
[4:35:31] Jinzok: Chernarus is big af yet 70% empty
[4:35:31] SegaCreaMcast: That's what my gf said...It doesn't matter.

[4:35:37] clearvep: it's all about girth guys
[4:35:39] Tuumai1: dayz exploring is insane
[4:35:41] itsbum_: You can have an amazing game with a tiny map. or an amazing game with a big map. It really is more about mechanics and everything else

[4:35:45] eoinfps: have you seen the finals? @shroud
[4:35:54] Graphflicks: We understand Shroud, we agree.

[4:36:03] rickybobbi_: @SegaCreaMcast ya my ex said that also
[4:36:04] Hatch_NZ: namalsk is the best map & smallest
[4:36:05] d8oos_: like cod mw2
[4:36:06] PepegaMods: If there's a lot of people saying it matters, it usually matters
[4:36:10] 1lurker: Day Z is a single player game
[4:36:10] ceebs1h: what game he talking about just tuned in
[4:36:10] iitsskyz: rust has the best player to map ratio
[4:36:12] syriusxe: !monitor
[4:36:12] StreamElements: He uses the ASUS ROG Swift 360Hz 27" Gaming Monitor https://bit.ly/3NepLdk

[4:36:18] drbarber131: @exinfps did you play in the closed playtest
[4:36:19] Under_Growth: Yes, a balance point is necessary, but saying the size doesn't matter disingenuous

[4:36:42] SmokaLaLa: people wanna just stay on coast so they run back to their body if they die. instead of taking advantage of the whole map
[4:36:43] levig1123: i feel like 90% of dayz players are all on 10% of the map
