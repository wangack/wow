[0:25:46] Lovehaus: @insaniity the trio can't play unless they all are playing - can't log on to solo or duo with those characters
[0:25:47] Recycle_pls: Does shaman get to use passive to rez or is it still perma death
[0:25:48] 7Berzerk: Shaman quests for totems are so cool. Except the water one if I remember correctly
[0:25:49] dizzlethebot: 3 mages would be broken
[0:25:49] drewthedireone: geez, thats pure masochism
[0:25:54] drewthedireone: thank u :D
[0:25:57] sahdhusaghdah: many ppl don't know what these quest givers actually say since they never read the quest text in their life and now it sounds rly cool when they hear it...
[0:25:58] insaniity: ah I see @Lovehaus
[0:26:07] Fulger2000: @iSunRex ty

[0:26:28] knavelgazer: well feeling like it's 2005 had to come to end. bye!
[0:26:39] d3rpdarp: dual hunter/druid I think would be fun. just for something different.
[0:26:39] anOceaninadrop: @fulger2000 you can search classichc dot net for info, on google
[0:26:43] 7Berzerk: @sahdhusaghdah haha thats what I thought. I'm questing rn and I have quested in barrens, durotar, needless, tanaris etc many times and this is the first time im hearing the actual text

[0:27:43] aerodynam1c: what if ou get flurry axe
[0:27:50] JerseyBricklayer: shroudLurk someone say cougars eh
[0:27:56] anOceaninadrop: @sillystringsurprises usually only if you opt in for it, but griefers can flag you for pvp with a bug and then kill you, you can appeal that though
[0:27:59] OniiDante: @SillyStringSurprises i think yes? cause saw some clips of people pretending to be npcs
[0:27:59] UberJach: Who's Ellie? @shroud
[0:28:01] mi5t3rph15t3r: So what you are saying is it isn't troll at all to use.

[0:28:29] insaniity: what about 2 1H 5Head @shroud

[0:28:40] Fossabot: @EvolutioneX3 He uses the ASUS ROG Swift 360Hz 27" Gaming Monitor https://bit.ly/3NepLdk
[0:28:44] Destro82: dagger and shield is great
[0:28:46] UberJach: @UberJach Thanks guys
[0:28:48] Destro82: as shaman
[0:28:52] JerseyBricklayer: @itsmeglenn12 gday sir shroudWave
[0:28:55] ootinee: jokerd level 1hander because he got flurry and with windury it was beast
[0:28:57] Staticlight: what is this hardcore business, is it like a hardcore realm or something?
[0:28:58] UniversalKhaos: UniversalKhaos subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months!

[0:31:23] DeadIceMan: @shroud ever play Everquest 2?
[0:31:30] TandomBicycle: did they die on other characters chat?
[0:31:34] UniversalKhaos: True
[0:31:40] oprawindfurytv: shroud4Head
[0:31:42] anOceaninadrop: @bonesh0ck89 only until lvl 20 then sub based
[0:31:47] WytChapp: Bc of this dude I’ve started all shaman toons on retail and classic from my ret lol
[0:31:51] TxM_Success: I wanna get back into this game. It was so fun.
[0:31:56] bradn323: it's the same
[0:32:00] oprawindfurytv: shroud1 shroud2
[0:32:00] bradn323: for fire
[0:32:02] oprawindfurytv: shroud3 shroud4
[0:32:03] PhysicsPlease: Did he crank up vibrance or what? These colors are crazy
[0:32:12] ZenoGamesTV: is this challenge played on retail classic servers?
[0:32:16] ootinee: another reason jokerd was leveling with a 1hander is because he was tanking on his shaman with a shield in dungeons
[0:32:16] BoneSh0ck89: @iSunRex and its vanilla only?
[0:32:22] anOceaninadrop: @wytchapp which did you enjoy more on retail between pally and sham and why?
[0:32:23] d3rpdarp: @PhysicsPlease just mulgore.
[0:32:28] Destro82: u need to go to durotar
[0:32:32] fallengodz: @shroud how do you play WoW hardcore? where do you get this
[0:32:46] TxM_Success: I had every character lvl 100 before I stopped and they kept adding new stuff
[0:32:47] oprawindfurytv: shroudNom
[0:32:48] Slyratt: Shaman leveling with dagger and flame tongue is bis
[0:32:48] Grinnnn: are you gonna play season 2?
[0:32:49] 7Berzerk: :) /console ffxGlow 0
[0:32:50] KineticConundrum: console ffxglow 0

[0:32:51] PhysicsPlease: /console ffxGlow 0
[0:32:54] anOceaninadrop: @bonesh0ck89 on a sub you get vanilla and wotlk included, for retail you also have to buy the game

[0:33:29] rottinglichh: Bruh have you even slept today lmao
[0:33:33] minde1: yo @chat yo shroud
[0:33:35] PhysicsPlease: @d3rpdarp Mulgore has never looked like that for me. He definitely has some vibrance increased somewhere. The xp and combat text are also way over staturated
[0:33:35] WytChapp: @isunrex Shaman has a lot more you have to watch and learn and do more of. Pally much easier to play but it is fun imo now ret is basically unkillable due to defensive. shams will die quick but have lots of mobility
[0:33:43] lyasz: @TxM_Success prob bloodsail its the designated HC server
[0:33:51] zymr_: should i get this game ??
[0:34:02] mandurilxl: paladin = bubble hs master race
[0:34:03] TxM_Success: I gotcha. I used to grind the shit outta this game nonstop

[0:34:09] blurTTV: shroudDab shroudDab
[0:34:10] oprawindfurytv: Rockbiter damage > flametongue damage
[0:34:15] 7Berzerk: You can also turn off death glow effect but I guess you wont be needing that command in HC LUL
[0:34:31] oprawindfurytv: Need a dagger for flametongue to work better
[0:34:31] WytChapp: @wafflingwafflee I ran rockbitter til I got wind fury for sure
[0:34:41] oprawindfurytv: Same
[0:34:42] anOceaninadrop: @wytchapp hmm ok, so considering that which one would you pick as more fun to you overall?
[0:35:03] oprawindfurytv: Yea I know, maybe get a dagger for flametongue
[0:35:03] realxguardian: same duo as yesterday?
[0:35:09] arkkaedia: there is an atk speed break point for flametongue yea
[0:35:12] 7Berzerk: giving the repair bill to tyler wp shroudy rowdy
[0:35:13] realxguardian: or did u die and remake new duos
[0:35:15] WytChapp: @isunrex Shaman. Once you figure out the gameplay I do enhance myself
[0:35:15] Unbound_Entity: why does Garasil sound like a medical ointment rofl.

[0:36:40] filthyplebss: how do you play this hardcore?
[0:36:41] AvoidsM8: Im guessing on your other HC toons you have to play as a TRIO no matter what?
[0:36:41] Krisen89: Hairy cock
[0:36:45] daffybright_: @shroud how are you enjoying wow so far
[0:36:47] SelockxSJB: @zymr_ Hardcore
[0:36:47] poruVAL: @zymr_ hardcore
[0:36:53] Arroz_Docy: @filthyplebss its an addon
[0:36:53] CorvusANR: does the server actually permadead you or do you just agree to stop playing, like an honor system?
[0:36:54] Frettin_FPS: 4 ele shams? bruh you crazy KEKW

[0:37:06] filthyplebss: @Arroz_Docy like on curse client?

[0:37:32] MrZomb1es: Whats ur favorite class to play… shaman?
[0:37:34] filthyplebss: @Arroz_Docy ahh kk ty tho
[0:37:36] runescaper900: When did you start playing hc?
[0:37:40] Ykiller99: what is the addon that makes the npc talk
[0:37:48] me__Alex: tank/heal/dd druid trio? poggers
[0:37:50] runescaper900: @ykiller99 voiceover

[0:38:03] CorvusANR: this was before voice acting really got good

[0:38:23] oprawindfurytv: Eh I don’t like 2s
[0:38:29] kcamptko: Enh do dam in classic??
[0:38:30] AvoidsM8: chat the trio playing last night, do they HAVE to play trios on those toons?
[0:38:31] anOceaninadrop: @corvusanr there is no official hc yet so they didn't adapt auto delete, the hardcore addon tracks your gameplay so when you die you lose the status and then you're supposed to delete char by yourself
[0:38:34] Arroz_Docy: why are u still playing this game like a first person shooter xD
[0:38:40] oprawindfurytv: Lsd LSP and thunder. And I love 5s so ele def the way
[0:38:43] Frettin_FPS: dont hurt the doggo OhMyDog
[0:38:45] bobberto77: is hardcore just vanilla classic?
[0:38:46] runescaper900: @avoidsm8 yeah that's the rules
[0:38:47] Solar5: @shroud Do you think Valve will add new gun to CS2? For example, like a AK variation as the M4A1 was an alternative to the M4-S.
[0:38:49] yomaama15: in barrens

[0:45:51] xaaaaa: @xaaaaa wow
[0:45:52] yourgreatsln: Shit id pay 1000
[0:46:06] oprawindfurytv: Yea you can choose to be immortal at 60

[0:46:14] jcrozz: what mini map addon is he using?
[0:46:15] jpat__: want to get into wow but it looks hella daunting

[0:46:35] oprawindfurytv: Cause you like we totem
[0:46:37] KJFreshly: I adore classic leveling and the world the most. Would love to see more classic+ stuff
[0:46:39] enigmasvea: HC HYPEEEEE
[0:46:40] UberJach: OSRS gank
[0:46:41] oprawindfurytv: Wf totem like me
[0:46:41] UberJach: gang
[0:46:41] jpat__: @haunting_haunter would you rec retail or classic

[0:47:02] yourgreatsln: Shroud is honestly the only thing that could bring cuisine royale back to life
[0:47:05] Blackeye1992: @shroud are you doing ce for 10.1?
[0:47:05] Artixono: random little updates
[0:47:07] SuperDuckiez: yea but osrs and WoW are totally different. osrs is a click based mmorpg very very unique from all other mmorpgs out there
[0:47:08] succaw: @blernnn not its on the public servers they just use an add on for the offical hardcore
[0:47:11] haunting_haunter: @haunting_haunter youll get overwhelmed in retail
[0:47:20] kENZ_v2: @yourgreatsln how recent? and if u say when they changed the name, u big cap :P
[0:47:23] jpat__: @haunting_haunter it looks crazy from what i watched
[0:47:30] 7Berzerk: thoughts about classic+ or w/e they call it?
[0:47:34] kartoffmel: @fourjojo there is an addon to hide them behind 1 button
[0:47:38] arph0s: If they gave classic wow a separate team and took player decisions from polls it would be insane
[0:47:45] real__zorro: Bro
[0:47:46] Opethian01: Look at the open landscape, so nice. That doesnt exist anymore in the expansions, everything is compressed, very bad
[0:47:47] Ephilious: Its funny that there older games are getting more attention than their retail versions
[0:47:49] meezplz: i wish retail wasnt so easy
[0:47:55] triplezro: are u guys doing two hardcore characters simultaenously??? god bless u

[0:48:24] RonArtest: and i got like 15k hours in both
[0:48:25] NotTheDev: arena
[0:48:25] Artixono: community polls. new dungeons not higher levels but just more content
[0:48:25] LucidAntics: @RonArtest awful take
[0:48:25] ootinee: New raids and  tier armour
[0:48:25] Scrollocks: Better class balance.  Half the specs are useless in end game pve

[0:48:39] raitlinn: like actual raids :')
[0:48:40] Warchief_Guldahn: fix water pathing, and DCs
[0:48:40] dizzlethebot: Change loot tables….have same loot just change where it drops
[0:48:40] blernnn: If you die do you manually have to delete your character
[0:48:41] 7Berzerk: Dont change the gameplay maybe just add content
[0:48:42] arph0s: You could add a shit ton of quality of life etc cool stuff
[0:48:44] regnurza: up to northrend content with level 60 cap
[0:48:45] Rec0rdit: horizontal progression, class balancing, and new content would be difficult to manage in WoW versus OSRS
[0:48:45] rhycomz: dungeon finder

[0:48:47] lucidakamaze: wotlk talents and rotations

[0:48:55] bearryj: add runescape community voting
[0:48:55] ootinee: change nothing gameplay wise just give people arenas and new dungeon content
[0:48:56] SaucedBoom: WoW vanilla 2
[0:48:57] blurkboy: classic +
[0:48:57] LucidAntics: Hardcore is really the only good form of classic content though, even if they added new end game
[0:48:58] dutchkoalaty: arena
[0:48:59] Opethian01: i want the open landscapes back
[0:49:00] TMKay: i imagine vanilla+ but it will never happen

[0:49:04] glindes: arena
[0:49:04] SpaceCrow92: taking time for pexing
[0:49:05] piefayth: should gear be upgrades or sidegrades? you would change balance
[0:49:06] Dypaka: probably to see you lose a lvl 45 character to some bullshit
[0:49:08] h4zey_: transmogs
[0:49:08] Nivekpro: some class tuning to give some diversity in the class spectrum
[0:49:09] Numtjok: explore alternative storylines
[0:49:10] hate_xyz: better skill balance because they weren't really balanced at launch
[0:49:10] EC_Zold: ALL SPECS TO BE PLAYABLE!
[0:49:12] DrHourin: the feeling of how dangerous lvling is and not just rush end game
[0:49:12] 7Berzerk: new content pretty much (arena, raids,...)
[0:49:12] Saturos47: @shroud belves and draenei in vanilla
[0:49:14] jayveemilla: Just make a t4, 5, 6 with new raids and the same scaling. So you still have to go from Molten Core onwards to gear up
[0:49:16] xTerrylol: i need peak covid classic launch again..
[0:49:18] frathoss: Dual Spec
[0:49:19] droptopdave: Class balancing

[0:49:26] nv_prospekt: classic arena would be ResidentSleeper
[0:49:31] KING_C0C: Dungeon finder more similar to retail
[0:49:32] real__zorro: @haunting_haunter you have a unique name
[0:49:32] lordsharksmeer: Better profession stuff for lvling like better gear for blacksmith
[0:49:32] Cancelot8: The only thing classic is missing imo is the Jailer KEKW
[0:49:33] meezplz: @iSunRex i just mean the lvl experience you can get from start to end game in a day or 2
[0:49:33] MrGunnerDan: Make more specs viable, adding more zones with attunements for progressions that lead into more end game dungeons and raids
[0:49:34] LucidAntics: You would lose literally every warrior player if they balanced the game out, next idea KEKW
[0:49:35] RonArtest: fury warr has no comp
[0:49:38] Ephilious: Shamans need a huge balance update if they did that
[0:49:41] oprawindfurytv: Plus 1 for arena. And release karazan lvl 60
[0:49:41] 7Berzerk: shroudy wants to be a top dps with a ele shammy :p feel you

[0:49:59] Ephilious: Mages are amazing over all
[0:50:01] RonArtest: i tried to main enhance at 60 and gut shunned from nearly every raid, would win bis loot and everyones like do not give that ti enhance
[0:50:03] xTerrylol: but if you buff other class dmg to be relevant in raid, then they'd be broken in pvp. imagine locks or spriests w a dmg buff or something
[0:50:04] QwinVit: How runescape handled the relaunch of OS and made it a new branch of the game. Not just repeating what has already happened
[0:50:04] Celcoholic: a wow 2.0 with unreal engine 5 graphics vanilla version with integrated crafting and harvesting like new world implemented into a wow 2.0 version
[0:50:10] LucidAntics: the balance in wrath is very minimal compared to what theyd need here though
[0:50:11] lucidakamaze: Feral aswell
[0:50:15] Galdonir: wheelchair class

[0:50:44] Celcoholic: Imagine new world but a wow version
[0:50:45] 7Berzerk: rogues and warlocks still on top in wotlk?
[0:50:55] Zaptov: blizzard should just use the vanilla + servers custom content and polish it to be blizz like quality
[0:51:00] Deadnoz: ret paladin only relevant once they get shadowmourne LUL
[0:51:01] Jornisen: should they make classic f2p?

[0:51:17] Stormcs2: hardcore is insane
[0:51:18] 7Berzerk: actually :o
[0:51:28] raitlinn: Surely shamans can't use reincarnate in hardcore
[0:51:29] headWw: @Storm2045AI insane good ?
[0:51:30] zerodedz: shroud pls play fps games
[0:51:31] KJFreshly: If we don't trust blizz to do new dungeons, we could at least gear new gear, more mana regen and stuff
[0:51:31] LulAderSchatz: How can i play wow HC ? i dont understand can anyone help me ?
[0:51:32] arph0s: now imagine they actually had a separate development team to carry these updates out, it could be huge
[0:51:37] jpat__: @haunting_haunter wotlk or regular classic
[0:51:45] haunting_haunter: @jpat__ regular

[0:56:47] SaucedBoom: Exactly from what you said it should 100% be perma
[0:56:47] Jawaka23: so it's totally warranted imo
[0:56:48] shaun986: dude would’ve gotten three strikes in less than an hour. perma is the result of weeks of griefing
[0:56:50] digitalpanhandlr: i mean personally i think it sucks, but also, it can be kinda lulz

[2:03:38] MustardTigrs: @Cynergi_ i get it the english language can be hard for someone but your comments implies that dual wield exist in classic when it does not, its pretty straight forward

[2:12:05] SoaDivine: 14 i think
[2:12:11] TobyJ_: @JeraMMOs 14 its on the bar
[2:12:21] thepunisher7899: LUL LUL
[2:12:24] Cynergi_: Windfury is a straight 20% chance in classic. Can use dagger to get more but they are tiny. Alwyas want a slow weapon
[2:12:26] theGraye: stoneskin is stronger the more mobs you are fighting at one time
[2:12:32] Bazzzel: 24 talons Pog
[2:12:43] SoaDivine: yes but the faster you atk the more procs you get
[2:13:03] green_candles: But the procs are smaller
[2:13:05] Greengobingo: Thought it was a duo?
[2:13:08] Cynergi_: Ya but they will stilll hit for a third of the dmg one big wf would or less
[2:13:25] Cynergi_: Fast wep is really nice with flametongue in classic tbh for leveling
[2:13:25] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[2:13:29] Delroy_OCE: Yeah sure, let's just give Shaman ANOTHER upgrade. LMAO
[2:13:34] Delroy_OCE: They have it all, yet want more.
[2:13:37] adhd_davis: what spec mage am i going
[2:13:45] oprawindfurytv: I bet you number 1 way to die on a shaman is using totems in a bad spot
[2:13:49] lhteaa: Damn we got a longgg way ton
[2:13:53] lhteaa: Go
[2:13:56] jer4mey: What server?
[2:14:05] Pr1m0x21: @adhd_davis graveyard
[2:14:06] KineticConundrum: Bloodsail Buccaneers
[2:14:07] SoaDivine: each iteration of WF can also crit a shaman can do in one hit what most classes can do in 20 seconds of dps
[2:14:10] adhd_davis: bloodsail ?
[2:14:16] joshuathearies: bec00l1Gege
[2:14:18] adhd_davis: @Pr1m0x21 true actual
[2:14:22] anOceaninadrop: @adhd_davis fire for single target, frost for everything else but it also works single target and it's safer overall
[2:14:22] jokurandomspede: change title
[2:14:24] Cynergi_: Ya no totem recall blows in classic should be a QOL improvement they make tbh
[2:14:34] adhd_davis: ya frost slows
[2:14:35] ImWaspy: @jokurandomspede whats wrong with title
[2:14:35] OhYeahitsKT: !title
[2:14:35] Drummish: It's free real estate
[2:14:37] KillaCamJam: @jokurandomspede to what?
[2:14:37] adhd_davis: for sure
[2:14:44] Cynergi_: Need to waste mana repllacing totems etc
[2:14:46] TobyJ_: @Cynergi_ then it wouldnt be classic
[2:14:50] Delroy_OCE: How is changing 4 GCD's not going to impact both PVE or PVP?
[2:14:50] RaxtonTV: @SoaDivine ya and then rip aggro and die
[2:14:57] Delroy_OCE: It's a direct gameplay change. + the quality of life.
[2:14:59] Chuckclean21: milk booba
[2:15:04] Generalphoxly: most people forget the stagnant oasis spawns these 2
[2:15:13] Cynergi_: Classic is very far from original vanilla anyways
[2:15:23] anOceaninadrop: @adhd_davis remember to bind that frostbolt rank 1 when you get high lvl, just for a quick slow
[2:15:24] Cynergi_: Couple things would be nice
[2:15:43] Krait06: classic+ would be sweeet
[2:15:44] blurTTV: shroudDab shroudDab
[2:15:52] Nixal_: there was an addon SimpleRecallTotems, was it disabled?
[2:15:56] adhd_davis: @iSunRex ty papi first time mage ive played every class but mage n rogue
[2:16:03] Cynergi_: Classic + would prob be their biggest xp since og woltk...
[2:16:05] SoaDivine: @RaxtonTV lol i used to insta pull bosses and die all the time. hit a 39 pally for almost 2k and one shot him on a pvp server
[2:16:07] joshuathearies: k4y4
[2:16:12] Delroy_OCE: I suppose. I just think one way to balance Shamans is to make them wait 4 GCD's. It doesn't matter overall.
[2:16:24] Delroy_OCE: I'd still press Accept on my mage regardless to the duel. LMAO
[2:16:31] KillaCamJam: @seanthefriendly BibleThump
[2:16:43] anOceaninadrop: @adhd_davis if it's your first time, always have cone of cold, frost nova and sheep rank 1 :)

[2:17:51] anOceaninadrop: @adhd_davis haha no worries, enjoy
[2:17:54] Delroy_OCE: At level 20 you unlock Blizzard. So it doesn't matter so much what SPEC you choose until then. If you want to save a bit of cash stick with frost.
[2:17:55] kanias1103: @SoaDivine i like never played WOW so i idk these stuff
[2:17:56] syntora_: chat, is using ankh still death to delete for a shaman?

[2:22:45] nock7urn4l: @Cynergi_ what level did you start at in there? I remember trying non HC grinding in there at like 42 and could barely make it to the gy
[2:22:48] Destro82: did the play this togetther ofstream ?
[2:22:48] Tops_Drop: @whoactuallycaresman restedxo
[2:22:49] VolpesVolpes: Did they die? Last time I was here earlier today they were Tauren.
[2:22:51] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[2:22:57] nock7urn4l: @Cynergi_ like 46?
[2:22:58] Tops_Drop: @whoactuallycaresman restedxp*
[2:23:04] Cynergi_: RestedXP is the other addon
[2:23:06] anOceaninadrop: @cynergi_ you can take more than 4 mobs for sure, blizz grind is just safest and easiest
[2:23:18] languini22: ur guys are doing skinning+leatherworking/mining+engineering/ ??+??
[2:23:26] dnosu: I just hope new MMOs come out eventualy and end up being good... We keep going back to old ones lol
[2:23:28] Delroy_OCE: @whoactuallycaresman RestedXP is a speed running tool. But a viable and efficient questing guide.
[2:23:30] CosmicEvo: @VolpesVolpes no the taurens are shroud and ska's duo, these are the trio squad
[2:23:30] BluelightCT: @VolpesVolpes thats duo with just ska
[2:23:31] philupmycupdoe: kings dont wait in no line
[2:23:34] Cynergi_: I went at 42 grinded till 53 like 5-6 other mages I've leveled in the past
[2:23:37] Delroy_OCE: It teaches fun tips and tricks even to veteran players.
[2:23:40] Delroy_OCE: Thanks to speedrunners
[2:23:49] ZaddyMar: Yo honest question, if i haven't played any WoW before, but want to get into HC classic. is this a good idea without any experience?
[2:23:52] Cynergi_: Done it thousands of times, wouldn't really suggest it on hc
[2:23:58] Delroy_OCE: @ZaddyMar Yes
[2:23:59] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[2:24:04] tuutti2furious: @ZaddyMar prepare to die
[2:24:08] ZanahoriaCR: Copege
[2:24:18] alantin77: he not using Gathermate?
[2:24:18] CosmicEvo: @ZaddyMar sure! just be prepared to die and learn a lot
[2:24:18] ZaddyMar: I've been watching hella WoW videos because of hardcore and never had the itch to play wow until now lol
[2:24:20] Delroy_OCE: @ZaddyMar The game is designed as though the more you invest in learning and studying your class/role/gameentirely the better you get.
[2:24:23] Delroy_OCE: So you can play at your own pace.
[2:24:24] deebo5o2: is this on a classic server for retail?
[2:24:33] Delroy_OCE: If you want to become the best, you 'can' train yourself.
[2:24:38] anOceaninadrop: @cynergi_ makes sense
[2:24:40] Delroy_OCE: The information is easily accessable.
[2:24:48] Zeusgg: you guys can get 5g each from Orphan quests this week
[2:24:56] digitalpanhandlr: ^
[2:24:57] alantin77: 85 for the target dummy
[2:24:58] Breezychain: @ZaddyMar you will def have fun with hc
[2:24:58] ZaddyMar: appreciate yall, couldn't find any info of anyone who's done this on reddit, and was wondering if i was wasting my time, and if im gonna be knowledge locked because im playing ac ertain way
[2:25:12] dee_p4k: 1000% Shroud doesn't read this message Kappa
[2:25:17] Cynergi_: I almost died too very close couple times and I've done that place and boosted mara and zg on other servers for years
[2:25:18] digitalpanhandlr: 30 minutes of runnin around, and you get 5 for orphan quest
[2:25:23] digitalpanhandlr: 5g
[2:25:29] chippymojo: What you eating?
[2:25:30] Breezychain: @ZaddyMar going in with no info is really fun in its own way
[2:25:36] CosmicEvo: @ZaddyMar imo if you're having fun it's not wasted time, but characters will die. just be preapred for that
[2:25:39] kingthrasherlive: Ey ey ey!!!
[2:25:39] Narkaros: How many lvl 60 in the server?
[2:25:43] ZaddyMar: that's true, im hella excited to learn while being scared of dying lol
[2:25:57] alantin77: Silver bar   Tin nodes can randomly be Silver
[2:25:58] mrfrostyy_: !level
[2:25:59] kingthrasherlive: kingth41Christ1
[2:26:01] anOceaninadrop: @cynergi_ yeah blizz grind is best aoe for hc ^^ anything other is too risky
[2:26:13] Delroy_OCE: @ZaddyMar I've played for a lil less than 13 years. When the game came out, we were all pioneers. But the game meta is now dictated by the elitists (mostly jerks) who have ripped this game apart mathematically speaking.
[2:26:14] ThVium: exposed is useless other 2 are great though
[2:26:16] ZaddyMar: I'm no stranger to hardcore games so im excited. this weekend about to no life my 10 level 5 characters that are about to die
[2:26:20] Delroy_OCE: THERE IS A CERTAIN WAY you should be playing.
[2:26:20] weightmaker: give him your cloth maybe?
[2:26:24] BasedGadu: save money and dont learn rez
[2:26:31] Delroy_OCE: But if you didn't grasp that concept through levelling your character and digesting everything.
[2:26:35] Delroy_OCE: Just by enjoying the game and learning.
[2:26:39] Delroy_OCE: Then no, don't play WOW.
[2:26:40] MARKetzeRoo: Remember you need medium leather for goggles
[2:26:40] Cynergi_: Ya. I risked it all doing zf. The jumps are harder than the aoe... Just like all mage boosts
[2:26:42] Delroy_OCE: But if you like learning.
[2:26:42] roibravo: polla
[2:26:48] ZaddyMar: @Delroy_OCE I think that's why i'm excited because my only knowledge of this game are asmongold and hardcore players on stream
[2:26:48] Delroy_OCE: As you go, and following the advice of others.
[2:26:49] sazo_luis: OMEGALUL
[2:27:07] ZaddyMar: @Delroy_OCE kind of feels like tarkov for the first time again lol
[2:27:13] ZaddyMar: been chasing that feeling for a while
[2:27:15] Delroy_OCE: Tarkov is are more difficult game to learn than WOW
[2:27:20] Delroy_OCE: I think that's unanimous here.
[2:27:23] Delroy_OCE: To those who have played both.
[2:27:26] Delroy_OCE: ^ @everyone
[2:27:31] Mokalossh: Agreed
[2:27:32] anOceaninadrop: @cynergi_ yeah, a lot to know for efficient boosting
[2:27:32] Cynergi_: You can get a free rxp guide full version if you just search the ownedcore forum... Ezpz
[2:27:36] perichoresislive: PvP server?
[2:27:38] Dzeaz: @Delroy_OCE "tarkov is are"
[2:27:39] ZaddyMar: this gives me hope, lets goooo
[2:27:43] kaelraa: to learn no, to master yeah since it's really skill based (tarkov)
[2:27:44] Pm_squirtle: @delroy_oce tarkov is are ?
[2:27:57] Skillz4Mealz: !addons
[2:27:57] Pm_squirtle: Your sentence structure is hard to learn
[2:28:08] Delroy_OCE: Okay, okay. For the nazis. "Tarkov are is more difficult.
[2:28:11] Delroy_OCE: HAHAHA
[2:28:15] mrfrostyy_: @shroud what level are you
[2:28:15] Dzeaz: wut
[2:28:16] Delroy_OCE: Thanks for the chuckle <3
[2:28:20] Cynergi_: Free zygorz guide or rxp full
[2:28:23] ZaddyMar: Tarkov is non binary makes sense
[2:28:27] okkenprawn: laughing at own bad jokes k
[2:28:33] r0ughhh: Hi
[2:28:38] Jarlaba: u get a ton of cloth in rfc too right?
[2:28:39] ShrekThreeOnDVD: Did you just assume Tarkov is singular? How dare you
[2:28:40] Jarlaba: iirc
[2:28:42] PONDO100: shroudJam shroudJam
[2:28:44] jake18453: !commands
[2:28:44] Fossabot: @jake18453 here's a link to his commands: https://fossabot.com/shroud/commands
[2:28:53] ZaddyMar: @ShrekThreeOnDVD nice lol
[2:28:56] anOceaninadrop: @okkenprawn made me chuckle, at least he's having fun. xD
[2:28:57] taephakdi_99: !Mouse
[2:28:57] Fossabot: @taephakdi_99 He's using the Logitech G303 Shroud Edition Wireless- With a Logitech G840 XL Gaming Mousepad shroud Edition - His mouse and mousepad are back in stock! Get it while you still can!
[2:28:58] Mokalossh: Tarkov takes 1000+ hours to be insane
[2:29:11] Delroy_OCE: @kaelraa My passion for RPG and Fantasy I think is what makes WOW an easier game for me to learn.   Not to be mistaken for my passion for FPS games. I enjoy both almost equally. I'm just more INTERESTED in Fantasy than Guns and Shit.
[2:29:13] jump_plx: @shroud you NEED to have DEATH=DELETE in title
[2:29:25] Mr_12_Iches: KEKW
[2:29:29] Mokalossh: I have 4500 and I can’t stand what they’ve done
[2:29:31] MidnightBisc: 123
[2:29:31] Delroy_OCE: So learning the game of Tarkov IS ARE was more difficult than trying to crossover my general FPS gaming skills.
[2:29:33] Delroy_OCE: If that makes sense.
[2:29:41] Delroy_OCE: The Gameplay of WOW is so intimidating. SURE!
[2:29:42] ZaddyMar: I'm on hour 800 and ive quit. I ain't looking back
[2:29:45] Delroy_OCE: But the gameplay is casual.
[2:29:45] Mokalossh: Agreed^^
[2:29:49] Delroy_OCE: Hahahaha
[2:29:55] KineticConundrum: people are dumb
[2:30:03] Vylent_: I don't play WoW and I understand
[2:30:03] jump_plx: It’s the unwritten meme rule of streaming HC
[2:30:03] Delroy_OCE: No Kinetic.
[2:30:07] Delroy_OCE: It's just me. I am dumb.
[2:30:07] FreakOnTwitch: !hardcore
[2:30:08] ChieveMoe: have you considered playing HC with Summit?
[2:30:09] antoniusyo: why arent your charakter frame and your party frames not lined? :(
[2:30:12] languini22: I respect u for not having death=delete on ur title shroud
[2:30:17] dnosu: "unwritten rule" so it doesn't matter is what you're saying
[2:30:22] GD_Smokey: @KineticConundrum hey I'm a people smoketvStare
[2:30:22] anOceaninadrop: @delroy_oce having fun? :P
[2:30:25] lighttni: is this shrouds new game?
[2:30:31] Cynergi_: 800 days played was years ago for alot of wow gamers lol
[2:30:31] jump_plx: @dnosu bro ofc it was a joke
[2:30:35] mandurilxl: @lighttni bro
[2:30:35] nock7urn4l: @antoniusyo why did you have to make me notice, now i cant look past it lmao
[2:30:39] koco92: Are groups like this allowed or is @shroud doing is own thing
[2:30:40] Delroy_OCE: @iSunRex Today is a good day.
[2:30:46] aluck22: I died to a lvl 1 boar
[2:30:51] CWORDPASS: Summit Juan G
[2:30:53] dnosu: @jump_plx lil bro thinks he's a comedian
[2:30:56] antoniusyo: im sorry @nock7urn4l
[2:31:04] digitalpanhandlr: no summit wants a group, but his friends keep dieing
[2:31:05] digitalpanhandlr: LUL
[2:31:07] diiibas: @antoniusyo graphic designer: -"first day?"
[2:31:08] omgzpwnd: is this classic?
[2:31:08] anOceaninadrop: @delroy_oce enjoy :D af least you're respectful
[2:31:10] UniversalKhaos: He is very solo oriented
[2:31:13] Fant3n: RFC today ?
[2:31:16] ChieveMoe: Id understand that, solo cool too but i get this vibe all too well. Makes me wanna play with my brother
[2:31:21] Delroy_OCE: Hey Shroud, do you like jokes!:   "You really gotta hand it to blind prostitutes..."
[2:31:27] ddmess: why play trio if u are enjoying duo rn
[2:31:28] dylanandco: Any progress on the Winter Cherno server? It was up for a bit during the later restart last night. Apologies if this was already talked about
[2:31:30] hashtagstronger: for dungeons they mean
[2:31:32] michaelkrk: is this official blizz server?
[2:31:48] KineticConundrum: yes
[2:31:50] zaxal_: the xp reduction of 3 people is also not that desirable
[2:31:50] Delroy_OCE: You know what? I really can't stand being in my wheelchair.
[2:32:05] AlphaSimply: Go Cold Blood and Preparation J9
[2:32:05] Lackattack8600: Kappa
[2:32:05] UniversalKhaos: Judd would just die alot with him lmao
[2:32:09] KOMZOMBO: @Delroy_OCE LUL !!!
[2:32:12] perichoresislive: PvP RP server?
[2:32:15] xhairbait: you need to setup gitHub for your DayZ Add-ons so you can see who made what changes
[2:32:21] jump_plx: @dnosu ok :)
[2:32:22] arph0s: rfc when
[2:32:27] anOceaninadrop: @delroy_oce LUL
[2:32:29] DommyJB: @shroud whats the addon that shows what abilites you get at each level?
[2:32:39] papajonhpizza: Whats his spec?
[2:32:41] shin_hong: i mean its kim shouldnt be surprise? LUL
[2:32:46] adhd_davis: enhance id assume
[2:32:47] Vylent_: catJAM
[2:32:53] KenM_in_FL: RareParrot
[2:32:54] xDrChoppy: chat, whats the ui he uses
[2:33:00] lighttni: leveling is the worst part about wow why do people enjoy this?
[2:33:02] adhd_davis: add shroudisdad on bloodsail <3
[2:33:12] Ghosted_SC2: I didnt know u could do hardcore in a group, are there any limitations?
[2:33:23] adhd_davis: @PowerOverwhelming907 if 1 teammate dies u all die
[2:33:26] anOceaninadrop: @lighttni because for some it's the best part :)
[2:33:29] Ghosted_SC2: oh lord
[2:33:40] Delroy_OCE: Wait, if 1 person dies. Everyone dies!?
[2:33:52] skinnyresto: i get why hes playing a 20 year old mmo, the games in the past year have been dog poop.
[2:33:53] borNi139: @Delroy_OCE yes
[2:33:55] anOceaninadrop: @delroy_oce yeah
[2:33:56] adhd_davis: pretty sure u gotta lay on the sword hehe
[2:33:59] Delroy_OCE: Well fuck me.
[2:34:02] Dahkoht_Lewin: Leveling in the world is awesome in Classic
[2:34:02] tha_wicked: i love classic wow leveling, any other leveling i cant stand
[2:34:03] ChieveMoe: Yeah i love to level in WOTLK
[2:34:04] rubiconv1: meed a sub
[2:34:05] SoaDivine: @PowerOverwhelming907 you all must stay together Xceot for druid and sham quests
[2:34:05] diiibas: rip telric
[2:34:06] Setoshi4K: when u died its over?
[2:34:06] frozenIRL: classic endgame sucks sadly
[2:34:12] omgzpwnd: why
[2:34:17] HotChocolate_: @PowerOverwhelming907 if 1 dies you all die, you have to be in the same zone/dungeon
[2:34:17] alantin77: classic leveling is dangerous
[2:34:19] Notsolegendary: @shroud you should practice utilizing the stoneclaw totem to manage groups and save Tyler mana
[2:34:19] adhd_davis: i love leveling im just always solo friends hate wow
[2:34:20] Riot_PhD: In retail they have now scaled all areas correct? so you could level anywhere you want?
[2:34:32] bbaassttiiii: the journey FeelsStrongMan
[2:34:32] Tuuba: @PowerOverwhelming907  It doesn't matter, you can't die in a group. Trio hardcore runs don't end due to deaths, they end when 1 person loses interest and you have to start over cause you're not allowed to level solo/duo after you've already started as a trio
[2:34:33] Zoazz: How can i play Classic HC?
[2:34:35] Delroy_OCE: In early 2000's this game was a game which allowed the players to pioneer the game. As in, we were all on an unforseen adventure. ALL LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER AS WE WENT ALONG!
[2:34:40] ChieveMoe: yeah zebras are kinda thicc early on too
[2:34:40] zaxal_: classic u get to play 1-60 vs playing just to get 60
[2:34:44] Delroy_OCE: So questing in Classic, back in the day. Was also because of the Adventure.
[2:34:45] Numtjok: Chance to hit is very important
[2:34:48] Delroy_OCE: That has died to become a chore.
[2:34:55] tha_wicked: its about the journey not the destination in classic
[2:34:56] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[2:34:57] anOceaninadrop: @zoazz search classichc dot net on google
[2:35:05] geronimusbosk: You playing enha?
[2:35:07] Delroy_OCE: So I understand why the fun is lost. Most wow lovers still find nostalgia in it. I think
[2:35:10] peacemakerrrrrrrr: ur going sham tank till 40?
[2:35:13] ImBaelfire: still playing that pixelised mmo wannabe in 2023? :S
[2:35:15] Mokalossh: @delroy_oce you’re having no bad takes today
[2:35:15] alantin77: i remember tanking Wailing Caverns on my Shaman on launch
[2:35:32] tha_wicked: @Delroy_OCE nah its just a fun game, nostalgia has nothing to do with it generally for the players who play long term
[2:35:32] Kas50: @ImBaelfire LUL you mean the best MMO there is
[2:35:34] Yordyo: turn justin down hes omegaloud
[2:35:37] Delroy_OCE: Thanks for the recognition @Mokalossh
[2:35:38] Delroy_OCE: You're loved.
[2:35:40] Tuuba: @Mokalossh complaining about others basically solving the game and pretending that you have to listen to those people is a huge L
[2:35:40] mrfooon: So is it because your skills and how close they are tied to levels that makes it good
[2:36:01] AznAlan15: this game became a chore, so a lot of my circle quit
[2:36:02] snoman420: COCK
[2:36:04] peacemakerrrrrrrr: sus to tank without a taunt
[2:36:08] castle_2: Are those zebras?
[2:36:15] Mokalossh: @tuuba what are you even talking about lol
[2:36:21] Tuuba: @castle_2 Don't be silly. they're zhevras
[2:36:23] lighttni: @krnjombi where
[2:36:24] clarky9percent: what addon gives you those enemy nameplates?
[2:36:24] ImBaelfire: @Kas50  the 12 mil of us that quit back in the days beg to differ
[2:36:28] Delroy_OCE: @Tuuba Where you might have a predispotion here towards me. I fucking love your attitude.
[2:36:30] Delroy_OCE: Commendable.
[2:36:30] Rhewiz: @Delroy_OCE why complain man, just let ppl play if u like the game then let others enjoy it their way aswell
[2:36:37] MasterGoofy: or if therre are aggro reset mechanics
[2:36:38] ドゥイ: is he still playing lost ark?
[2:36:42] Cynergi_: Wow is and alwyas has been a chore, if you want to stay relevant lol
[2:36:43] Qkfoo: if u die it's done? @shroud
[2:36:43] Duro777: threat management works fine in classic
[2:36:44] zodiac192133: rockbiter earthshock is great threat low levels
[2:36:44] Delroy_OCE: I wasn't complaining!
[2:36:47] peacemakerrrrrrrr: its hc. shit will go crazy
[2:36:49] anOceaninadrop: @delroy_oce you do at the same have to admit that the wow style has it's own good feeling, it's not only nostalgia
[2:36:50] lighttni: @dewi02 lost ark LUL
[2:36:55] Riot_PhD: watching this is bringing back so many memories.... Man I loved this game so much when I was in high school / college
[2:37:01] can_arg: when cs go ??
[2:37:07] anOceaninadrop: @rhewiz he wasn't complaining ^^

[2:37:13] haackster: @shroud you can move the death not over above your step box out of the middle of the screen
[2:37:17] pretttyyboyy: whats the steps on left side? that an addon?
[2:37:26] Notsolegendary: Priest has fade and he can generate huge aggro with stoneclaw, earthshock, and rockbiter
[2:37:30] Tuuba: why is lost ark a lul? Keep seeing people say that. is it just "dead game lul" or something more?
[2:37:35] Rhewiz: @iSunRex ye im an idiot sorry :/
[2:37:36] KineticConundrum: @pretttyyboyy pay2win addon
[2:37:38] hollaHK: are you going to be tanking dungeons as shaman
[2:37:40] mutedscrxxms: mutedscrxxms subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 8 month streak! fat weiners
[2:37:41] Kas50: @ImBaelfire idiot yet again... been playing on an off since TBC but guess what... there isn't another MMO better.... played Aion, GW, FF and about 5 dozen others but WoW is still WoW
[2:37:47] ayymie: fat weiners 2
[2:37:49] Strikezilla01: Taunt is a mechanic and should be used situationally. It's nice to have but unless a fight "needs" it for a tank transition or massive aggro drop, you shouldn't have to use it.
[2:37:50] alantin77: shaman tank just requires the group to use its CC skills
[2:37:55] Rhewiz: @Delroy_OCE ye sorry man im an idiot didnt read properly xd
[2:38:03] anOceaninadrop: @rhewiz I don't think you're an idiot, but no worries
[2:38:07] Yordyo: can you turn justin down shroud hes like twice the volume of you and eldoodaks
[2:38:11] alantin77: yea have to Kite Tank that boss asa a shaman
[2:38:18] a1exxx2k: Z
[2:38:20] Riot_PhD: @Kas50 I agree WoW gets in your skin and it becomes so much more. I have some of my best gaming memories in WoW
[2:38:22] italianstyleee: @Riot_PhD same man, good old days! <3
[2:38:28] Delroy_OCE: As a die-hard roleplayer, who got good at WOW over the years and now plays wow more completionism style. I am advocate of playing the game your own way, as it is by design.
[2:38:29] a1exxx2k: Za nashix
[2:38:29] agent_alpaca: SMOrc
[2:38:31] QQsTV: @shroud  what is the "Step 16" addon?

[2:38:52] Delroy_OCE: It does weigh heavy down on how the game has changed.
[2:38:52] Mapthesoul: Something which makes WoW stand out for me is the way it feels to press buttons in WoW it just feels smooth and nice to play
[2:38:52] ImBaelfire: @Kas50 do u always get toxic when u get cornered by facts?

[2:40:24] DivineOH: @Chutton 14
[2:40:29] anOceaninadrop: @mastergoofy it's worth the price for an mmo enjoyed, it's a good game and honestly for how much content you can get, it's a small price
[2:40:29] Sevaniuz: So is this blizz server or private server?

[2:40:43] anOceaninadrop: @mastergoofy enjoyer*

[2:41:04] yourMomIsMyISP: what is the name addon?
[2:41:10] yourMomIsMyISP: does it show hc names?
[2:41:13] ImBaelfire: @Kas50 nobody cried bro. just pointed out the obvious reality. u 're just a drama queen here :P

[2:41:43] Fant3n: Whistle and talk to your orphan
[2:41:45] milketa1: why is everyone leveling on wow recently?
[2:41:52] Sevaniuz: @borNi139 haven't looked at wow for a while - is there 3 types now? Dragonflight, WotLK and vanilla?
[2:41:54] YorkieKilla: @Elogain as someone who only played OSRS before wow I can see how its super casual, HC WoW is like normal mode for most other mmos ive played
[2:41:59] Kas50: @milketa1 Hardcore = content
[2:42:00] vFluxi: is there a way to 100% this?
[2:42:17] Vylent_: catJAM
[2:42:18] Delroy_OCE: @pretttyyboyy Some people have a belief that a game should be played a certain way. However your point still stands. Take Chess for example. Chess Bots exist, and we know they calculate all the possible moves.   A bot against a bot in a game of chess should, if not domino effect to a checkmate, it'll always become a draw.   However, a human player, can and has, found ways to beat these BOTS.
[2:42:23] anOceaninadrop: @delroy_oce yeah, compared to how much of an mmo wow felt in the past, it certainly feels like a solo game now, I agree with you, both contributed for the worsening of the game
[2:42:24] Delroy_OCE: So I completely agree with you.
[2:42:34] Cynergi_: Even the non hc servers on classic are the most populated of the game versions
[2:42:34] Delroy_OCE: But if you want to be good at chess, copy the bot as a BASELINE!
[2:42:36] Delroy_OCE: That's my point.
[2:42:38] Delroy_OCE: Learn from there.
[2:42:39] milketa1: oh, thanks!

[2:43:02] borNi139: @Sevaniuz Yes. An most players play on vanilla.. maybe few on wotlk.. but vanilla is main
[2:43:03] Cynergi_: Whitemane non hc is popping If you wanna actually do pvp

[2:46:28] Delroy_OCE: The only RPG I think is better than WOW is Morrowind. LMAO
[2:46:29] anOceaninadrop: @delroy_oce well the game is worse now because they lost vision of it :(
[2:46:36] Jeilsoe: Check pet owner and /target him
[2:46:43] Delroy_OCE: When do you feel like the vision was lost?
[2:46:45] pretttyyboyy: he goes up and down the bottom part as well
[2:46:49] Delroy_OCE: My honest opinion was Cataclysm.
[2:46:58] Tuuba: @iSunRex It's not like you're sacrificing time by buffing someone when you're just running somewhere and don't need to use any skills. and if your mana regens before you need it, it's free in that sense too
[2:47:01] tekstyleso: KEKW
[2:47:02] Jimbagg: Ah yes, more hc trio content Kreygasm
[2:47:04] DejarikTTV: he starts at camp at bottom of hill and pats up and to the camp infront of ship

[2:47:35] KirkTheCaptain: ofcourse theyre idiots... anyone taking time to try and fuck someone else over rather than just play the game is an idiot
[2:47:38] HeroxStunner: and you get random buffs in response
[2:47:39] Dahkoht_Lewin: Glad to see them go
[2:47:51] Frostlicious: Glad to see it
[2:47:58] anOceaninadrop: @delroy_oce hmm I had fun in legion last time, but I think the vision was lost... Maybe right before or in cataclysm
[2:48:19] Sukinato: griefers should be punished even if it isnt affecting a hc player.
[2:48:20] mjmffn: now they just need to ban alt right trolls in general chat
[2:48:22] Delroy_OCE: @iSunRex I'll give you a better picture of how I feel.   My father was the reason my 8 year old had the ability to sneak onto my parents computer at night and create my first character.
[2:48:24] KirkTheCaptain: my man just free plugging his twitch
[2:48:26] Delroy_OCE: My father taught me the game.
[2:48:33] eradin_: what addons u use mate ? for your font etc?? :)
[2:48:39] Delroy_OCE: As I grew up, I was in the same guild as my father. I ended up teaching my father.
[2:48:39] Visindyr: i only saw the one guy get perma'd, did they ban more>
[2:48:44] Delroy_OCE: My father quit, as life went on.
[2:48:47] smallssbtw: whats the name of this ui addon?
[2:48:53] Delroy_OCE: My father had time to try get into it again.
[2:48:58] Delroy_OCE: He kept getting kicked from groups.
[2:49:05] Delroy_OCE: Because of very small time losing mistakes.
[2:49:13] Delroy_OCE: He felt neglected and marginalized.
[2:49:13] Cynergi_: Looks like SUI or uber ui
[2:49:25] Delroy_OCE: The game should NEVER have evolved this way.
[2:49:33] Cynergi_: Sui is great
[2:49:36] bamfhealer: @Delroy_OCE STFU or send it in message to him god damn bro, no one cares

[2:52:44] anOceaninadrop: @delroy_oce you make a good point, retail still is worth a try, not really a bad game in itself, but I tried interacting with players and it's usually like talking to myself or something very brief, wow was popular for friends made along the way, it's a bit far from that now

[2:53:36] Delroy_OCE: So that being a deterrent to play the game, the people playing it, should spend more time helping others, than being selfish.
[2:53:39] thatkief: is this like hardcore iron man mode in runescape?
[2:53:43] Delroy_OCE: I don't know if that's like a dynamic. But if feels that way.

[2:57:39] GrimnirAegis: @dkrose1 They saw him like 3 minutes ago and he ran I guess
[2:57:42] Delroy_OCE: We couldn't have learned the game trying to support a household
[2:57:45] KeFF_J: -20000
[2:57:50] Delroy_OCE: Anyway.
[2:57:53] KirkTheCaptain: bro you are on one @Delroy_OCE
[2:58:14] Delroy_OCE: I think more interesting is how the next game that kills WOW needs to be SIMILAR to wow but DIFFERENT. I've thought about this a fair bit.
[2:58:19] kobbi96: anyone having issues with battlenet on EU?
[2:58:21] Delroy_OCE: It just, in theory. WOW can't be replaced.
[2:58:30] Delroy_OCE: Because we'll want WOW but a different WOW that's exactly the same.
[2:58:32] TheCorruptOne: @KirkTheCaptain why is this funny? there is no "offical hc server" so you can just repsawn

[2:59:12] Nufzz: @Delroy_OCE  Even solo?
[2:59:14] KirkTheCaptain: @TheCorruptOne thats the point of the addon to prevent things like this.... if youre gonna play HC play hc his char will be shown that it has died his HC run would be over
[2:59:14] Delroy_OCE: I'm impressed you spelled that correctly. @adothouse <3 respect.

[3:00:53] KiNG_Danlol: true that
[3:01:01] PackDup: yo shroud did you see the gameplay trailer for Chrono Odyssey?

[3:02:04] smilinsamuraii: did shroud and ska die on the duo?
[3:02:06] Delroy_OCE: And just as much, playing them games at any point in time. Even in 2423 (400 years from now) if computers exist and it's compatible on Windows 69. WOW is recommended.
[3:02:10] KirkTheCaptain: i think thats enough chat for today o7
[3:02:19] Delroy_OCE: It's a great game, and it's replayable. That's proof it's worth playing at least once.

[5:31:29] Dxphoz: @chandleriab really? I thought its just 40% off so $30 instead of $50
[5:31:33] wingwong29: @royally_persian id say you get more of a community feel in classic HC than retail...

[5:33:58] Result802: 1-59 you can only do each dung once
[5:33:59] Sergaaz: do they have to 3 man dungeons or they just 3 manning because rfc is easy?
[5:33:59] blowupmymind12: @earlyseasoneric in nutshell = classic is old fashioned and 'slow'. now revived cuz of hardcore (severly dont reccomend for new player). Retail (dragonflight) is very fast and you need to find a good guild to feel like 'part of the world'. DF is more instance based kinda
[5:34:11] Protomateria: @Segerr theyre just 3 manning cause theyre gigachads
[5:34:18] chandleriab: unpopular oppinion but i think retail is better for new players
[5:34:24] gggerms: How’d Justin get his voice so deep?

[5:34:35] royally_persian: Bruh, I was in this shit before MarkeeDragon had a beard…

[5:34:57] chandleriab: jumping from classic to retail is tough

[5:35:56] OG_Aconite: @chandleriab you get the leveling super fast if you leveld classic, since the helping hand but in m+ or raiding they have no idea
[5:35:58] spaceodyssey00: ohhh doods got a wand :)
[5:35:59] MARKetzeRoo: It’s classic with an add on don’t over think it.  Death equals delete
[5:36:15] chandleriab: @OG_Aconite yeah M+ is a whole other beast
[5:36:22] daftpanter: @quarles69 otherwise u will die at level 9-12-17- 20 if u are like new new yo the game you know what i mean?
[5:36:27] GordanRamseyGaming: yall finna die here
[5:36:29] GordanRamseyGaming: KEKW
[5:36:33] quarles69: @quarles69 i think both are valid, but if you want to pvp you will need to know what other classes do to an extent
[5:36:34] Protomateria: @GordanRamseyGaming PepeLaugh
[5:36:46] chaosrains: sure KEKW

[5:36:50] royally_persian: I wish they had PvP
[5:36:57] daftpanter: @quarles69 what pvp are u gonna do in a hardcore server that u are gonna be dead before 80
[5:36:58] chandleriab: unless you run mythics

[5:37:18] goodpandavibes: That is ACCURATE @shroud
[5:37:18] xxdockingdavexx: order for it to be hardcore do they have to complete every dungeon or is there a list of things they have to do?
[5:37:22] jiggyspice: 3K is a big crit for a bis geared lvl 60 lol
[5:37:23] daftpanter: @quarles69 and also if u do one and if u die u delete your pj man, that doesn't make sense
[5:37:33] shaun986: the bestiary addon uses max rank spells
[5:37:39] chandleriab: retail also has good starting zone for new toons
[5:37:42] saggyhonkerz99: I play on doomhammer and pvp gets to be pretty difficult depending the night I also play retail tho
[5:37:43] GOMCIO: 80dmg aoe
[5:37:43] therogers1: @xxdockingdavexx its just classic wow with hardcore add on so if you die you delete
[5:37:45] matching_towels: Costs mana to do everything in classic. It would drive me crazy, I’m used to retails speed
[5:37:46] Overpathos: I remember the pvp update on classic years ago, it was a massacre on my server
[5:37:50] saggyhonkerz99: Dem pally tho
