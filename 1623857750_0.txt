[0:37:07] Psynarius: I don’t recall if I had that issue last night
[0:37:30] Psynarius: Was pretty crowded in org
[0:37:31] SphinxyOCE: hmm weird. its actually annoying to deal with

[1:10:37] warrenny: Tbf ithink itll be like df then legion the sl. 123 expacs
[1:10:50] kowaikokoro: NODDERS log in do the content you enjoy and log off

[1:11:48] zysmos: i like to play different games
[1:11:52] KinggKebab: The thing is though, even if it's bad, let us enjoy the hype of a new expac until we see it's bad. Ruining peoples excitement for things really ain't the right way to go about it
[1:11:57] Featherbow: I'm around
[1:11:59] raye_gaming22: you can do taht it called raids and M+ do them on alts and you get stroger
[1:12:04] raldrik: I like power grinds. Even as a casual I know if I have 30 mins to pop in I can get one more neck level
[1:12:14] Justintegra31: what addon is that experience bar at the top with the xp/hour and session time details?

[1:12:46] LBroadwater13: I just enjoy playing the game I'm over here just playing cataclysm to get the storyline lol. I did get a little bored with shadowlands but I know I didn't get all the achievements it was on me not the game
[1:12:56] HoboFighter2: I feel like that is what they should do with Classic
[1:13:05] MaxTheBandit: is there any point of getting into retail before prepatch?

[1:17:25] Thoreya: yeah man. so many specs feel good in beta rn
[1:17:31] Thoreya: damage aside, classes feel real good

[1:18:31] sm0keo: im just happy i could level a character in a day, next day spam heroics/mythics, finish the world quest, then free days to level a main alt

[1:18:54] Thoreya: bro torghast
[1:18:57] Thoreya: was a killer for alts
[1:18:59] sm0keo: or just spamming heroics for conduits
[1:18:59] Thoreya: fuck that
[1:19:01] raye_gaming22: i guess you skiped korthia mate ? lolol
[1:19:03] sm0keo: in the first week etc
[1:19:07] kowaikokoro: torghast conduits renown PepeLaugh
[1:19:14] WoWRoach: Have they announced if they are adding character slots?  I deleted characters so I could have room for Evokers, but I'd like to keep them if I could.
[1:19:17] mavericks312: if they would have made cov's unchained SL wouldnt have been so bad
[1:19:22] Velashen: SL felt ass on alts.
[1:19:23] palakekw: man, having alt friendly expansion would make me play much more. If they force me to grind same things twice I'll just quit soon prolly
[1:19:36] Thoreya: i would rather play in traffic than grind torghast on multiple alts
[1:19:41] sm0keo: oh god i forgot about toghast, at the start of SL holy shit lol
[1:19:42] zysmos: I think the challenge for DF will be how much content devs will be able to pump in
[1:20:07] raldrik: issue with the SL grind was that it was time gated to death. It became chores
[1:20:10] BigDiezel: @Towelliee and there shouldnt be

[1:20:19] raye_gaming22: towell never did dom shards he would have a diffrent opinon let me tell you
[1:20:21] BlewGamingGroup: after 20 years ... theyve finally started to listen
[1:20:31] Thoreya: @mavericks312 it was quite literally the worst
[1:20:38] Sarocus: There is nothing to do in Dragonflight! -Towelliee 2022 ;)
[1:20:40] szble: yeah i thought the legendary crafting was ass
[1:20:51] WhizzleTeeTz: WhizzleTeeTz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[1:21:05] mavericks312: @Thoreya outside of the achieves and cosmetics i only touched torghast on my main
[1:21:07] sm0keo: if theres nothing to do, blizz will just add a system in 10.1 LUL
[1:21:23] Naenis: hopefully the raid isnt prison X for the tenth time
[1:21:27] Sarocus: I hear ya. I love a good grind, myself
[1:21:52] Calphurnious: I'm happy to level a character, gear'em out and move onto another this expansion around. Glad to not do a power grind and I love grinding
[1:21:58] jetributions: you respect his authority
[1:22:00] heydjzs: i like grinds, keeps you playing the game
[1:22:02] Sarocus: I will dive ALL the way into crafting, so might have plenty to do there
[1:22:02] instant_savage: i want a power gring to
[1:22:02] sm0keo: power grind will be trying to get those 20s done early in the xpac LUL
[1:22:14] instant_savage: but a legiuon power grind not a bfa power grind
[1:22:25] zysmos: I think if BFA systems were all account wide people woudn't complain about it
[1:22:31] mavericks312: bfa's grind was just as good though
[1:22:49] lilwaldo: @Towelliee How are warrior tanks so far in Dragonflight?
[1:22:52] szble: i hope 10.1 doesn't take forever to come out
[1:22:53] Prevention6: anyone know if dragon riding has any benefits beyond transportation
[1:22:55] BlewGamingGroup: they had to take it back to basics so that they could try to get back some of the millions of players that have left over the years due to constant grinds and having to play 5+ hours a day just to stay relevant
[1:22:59] paradoxyy: ?? are u an abomination
[1:23:05] mavericks312: anyone who didnt like bfa's grind probably started later
[1:23:09] nazvar: bfs tank with td's ... dayum what nice memories
[1:23:12] im_capy: lol facts
[1:23:13] kaos4666: i never got Midnight  in 10 years :(
[1:23:17] luckfore: legion/bfa my fav expacs
[1:23:35] im_capy: if i didnt work from home, no chance I could do half what I was doing in bfa. so much grinds
[1:23:36] bowdown3000: see I liked legion grind but I know not everyone liked it I felt like if I worked hard my dmg went up but I understand what people thought about it.
[1:23:46] kalamari__: luckely I still have a ton to do in legion/BfA/SL. so I am good with DF being more lighter on the system side
[1:23:46] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[1:24:06] sm0keo: @bowdown3000 a lot of the legion grind was doing everything you can to build bad luck protection for legendaries early on as well lol
[1:24:08] DownToFlash: I haven't played since legion but want to start again in dragon flight prepatch.  is it worth
[1:24:51] im_capy: I still think BFA was by far the hardest expansion to get flying unlocked
[1:24:59] bowdown3000: @smoko which in my head kinda made the game fun in my head but yeah understand if you played more characters.
[1:25:03] barktwo: I came into both BFA and Shadowlands very late.  Suited me well with catchups etc.
[1:25:14] bowdown3000: yes
[1:25:19] bowdown3000: I think that is good
[1:25:33] abracka_: blizz trolled you with heathcliff lol
[1:25:33] bowdown3000: but yeah if you play alot of characters it sucks though
[1:25:37] The_Yonaz: Zephus *shivers*
[1:25:48] The_Yonaz: Most dropped item in game, including ANy grey!
[1:25:54] BlewGamingGroup: sorry .... not sorry
[1:25:57] im_capy: Grinding that neck gave me ptsd and islands
[1:26:00] sm0keo: as someone who got the plate boots, speed legendary first, i was thoroughly tilted LUL
[1:26:24] ialwaysforget7: Thats how i feel about most of the Rep Loot... by the time you get revered you don't need it...
[1:26:56] OhNoNotAgain: Is that benthic gear we see?
[1:27:03] warrenny: That all benthic?

[2:09:50] rLeo2: If supporting Towellie means watching a few ads I dont mind
[2:10:01] naznarens: @nouwandhi install opera browser , allow integrated adblock, disable ads = no ads
[2:10:01] pereadin: Testing 123
[2:10:02] Molvonos: Quick way to avoid commercials: Subscribe or get Twitch Turbo.
[2:10:03] RiKywonka: Ads are not the end of the world.  I wish I could run ads while I was walking around making extra money.

[2:10:58] 91Niki: @rleo2 That wasn't me, that was the boss KEKW
[2:11:05] Rudric_Ice: ads are mans best friend
[2:11:08] Heliosz_: There are ways around ads you are on the internet I believe in you to figure it out
[2:11:11] bloodogg35: 4 that all i see 5 to 7 easy but it dont bother ne
[2:11:16] Lenietwitch: i didn't hear anything, i got an ad what were you talking about ? towHeh towHeh
[2:11:18] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: If i see Ads i just change tab and do smth else , while ads are muted
[2:11:19] mavericks312: but that ad revenue though
[2:11:22] TweektheProphet: you know the best way to avoid ads sub, you can get a free sub with your amazon prime sub
[2:11:32] Alepouditsa: what about the thing ppl say that you will be give 50/50 on the subs
[2:11:32] Purgatan: Not sure why people complain about ads...it helps support streaming.
[2:11:38] pereadin: I think twitch will come around after inflation slows down a bit.
[2:11:45] Rictamar: @Heliosz_ exactly, haven't seen an ad on Twitch for over 2 years at this point, regardless of if I sub :D
[2:11:47] ahies28: remmber its not always towel playing ads twitch does them too
[2:11:50] Lostdogal: I thought you were just here because you'd nothing better to do, you trying to tell me you're running a business to pay for a life for you and your loved ones?
[2:11:53] Carahail: @Purgatan this
[2:11:54] Spiralwalker74: ya it is what it is.. i got my 3 mins of ads an survived fine lol.. my daughter uses my prime for one of her friends streams an moneys tight so i cant afford to sub so if having a few ads is what i gotta do to hang out in the community so be it  :)
[2:11:57] Rudric_Ice: lots like $10
[2:12:00] naznarens: why would someone pay for turbo or prime when they can use an adblock, isnt it logical that if you dont have money at the moment that you would use adblock
[2:12:13] Thoreya: apparently evokers may not come right at prepatch. might be the 2nd phase of prepatch -____-
[2:12:31] ErkTheMighty: I wonder why people complain about stuff like that. Do they really think that making some snide comment about ads will make streamers just stop playing ads? lol
[2:12:39] Carahail: Carahail gifted a Tier 1 sub to Spiralwalker74! They have given 49 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:12:40] touchofpinkfizz: If you really enjoy watching someone you will put up with the ads or sub
[2:12:43] Featherbow: @Thoreya it was never said they would release with prepatch, it was said they would release DURING prepatch
[2:12:43] pereadin: Yeah that’s huge for a smaller streamer.
[2:12:43] Lenietwitch: @jeangulfran adblock is fine, but is basically stealing, so you do you, if you want to steal from the streamer, fine
[2:12:55] 91Niki: @ErkTheMighty People just like to complain for the sake of complaining and the attention that follows ijpSHRUG
[2:13:02] Thoreya: @Featherbow sadge
[2:13:05] Spiralwalker74: @Carahail aww thanks so much you didnt need to do that  <3
[2:13:05] waynef1985: you get adds watching tv that you pay for each month. it's the same principle
[2:13:34] xd_pad: why farm mounts when you already have the war bear? You already made it bro
[2:13:39] Carahail: @waynef1985 thats a very good point

[2:14:08] 91Niki: I just really wish they would change their method of ads. Don't completely interrupt the stream for people. Allow them to still watch and listen while the ad is up. Like a banner or something. So people don't miss out on stuff
[2:14:08] ahies28: its not always the streamer playing ads twitch plays ads too

[2:14:37] mavericks312: didnt they put the pre patch event up on ptr today?
[2:14:39] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @91Niki that happens on phone twitch sometimes,where u can still watch , but with a banner in the corner from amazon or smth
[2:14:40] NiteRhayven: LOL
[2:14:41] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[2:14:42] fire_fawkes: I saw they are
[2:14:47] Aidler: technically a streamer doesn’t play ads, twitch does. a streamer can only influence the time when ads are being played… but at a certain point they have to be played
[2:14:48] warrenny: They will prob announce it after the testing thing later
[2:14:50] WoWRoach: prepatch on the ptr today
[2:14:55] ahies28: rofl
[2:15:05] CurtleTheTurtle: Honestly I can't express enough how much stream time twitch turbo has saved me. It's also nice it gives streamer man full revenue as if I watched the ad
[2:15:09] MoodyVanessa: @warrenny that testing lasts the whole weekend
[2:15:12] Rictamar: pog, going to be lit
[2:15:12] pereadin: 😂😂
[2:15:14] szble: is it like legion invasions
[2:15:19] Ithylz: They could still delay the prepatch a bit without delaying the expansion release
[2:15:22] Fenwig: PTR not beta @Towelliee
[2:15:23] 91Niki: @91Niki They have it on some channels. I just don't get why it isn't just the main thing to do. It makes ads so much less tedious for people
[2:15:26] Molvonos: Molvonos gifted a Tier 1 sub to youtube! They have given 36 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:15:28] Kakotan2143: I dont think we will see Prepatch until Nov 1st or 2nd imo, they have done this before, ended the season then started the prepatch a week or 2 later
[2:15:32] Ithylz: 4 weeks of prepatch may be a bit long for them or so

[2:23:44] BlewGamingGroup: in all honesty when df opens ... you should just wipe out and re-load weakauras so that you know you have the most recent versions installed
[2:24:45] Stiffy84: Do i play Darktide beta or Scorn tonight... hard choice.
[2:24:46] Moobot: Details for DF Beta https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files/3974119
[2:24:46] bloodogg35: right now they have df regular order for 49.99 and shadowlands for 39.99
[2:25:26] 91Niki: @stiffy84 Both HYPERS
[2:25:31] pereadin: I just hope they fix their internal click casting system. It was an absolute nightmare to use on beta during the first M+ testing
[2:25:47] bloodogg35: i looked last week regular df was 59.99  so they dropped price 10.00
[2:25:57] Pallyofhell: is the pre patch thing going on now?

[2:34:28] helicroft: @pereadin roger! that dps meter looks hella fresh like the UI

[2:35:46] captivate7: its the simple things
[2:35:47] Chopadius: Have they said if the Evoker will be available during day one of pre-patch or just at some point during pre-patch?
[2:36:18] Rictamar: at some point ^ not day one
[2:36:29] lorddrekken: is the UI all the new Blizzard UI apart from WA?
[2:36:43] Chopadius: @Gylduran That sucks :(  Thanks for the info :)
[2:36:58] megrahh99: @Towelliee thought's  on no evokers in the first pre-patch we get on oct 25th but most likely on the 15th of nov   thoughts?
[2:37:15] Grimrg: I just got beta wow
[2:37:15] raldrik: he has an option to enable a healthbar, is it in there already?
[2:37:17] Pallyofhell: did they actually say that
[2:37:39] Pallyofhell: or is it just ppl making assumptions again
[2:37:40] Featherbow: @megrahh99 they never said evokers were releasing with prepatch. it said they would be released DURING prepatch
[2:37:44] ilskarius: Whiskey & WoW, Fridays are goooood
[2:38:11] pereadin: @Grimrg grats man! enjoy it while you can and report any bugs you find while you give it a shot :)
[2:38:27] Chopadius: Right, they've only said "during" but MrGM found two splash screens for pre-patch release info.  Maybe one is for if you pre-ordered and one if you didn't?
[2:39:00] Rictamar: Evokers were never a pre order bonus though
[2:39:10] Rictamar: unless my memory is wrong

[2:47:08] TheCliffyShow: Sylvanas
[2:47:12] LearnedSomething: Zovaal sounds like an STD
[2:47:38] mavericks312: have you or a loved one suffered from zovaal
[2:47:41] Ithylz: @shytam You mean PTSD?
[2:47:41] Kakotan2143: @shytam yeah LUL
[2:47:42] abracka_: my guild was talking about what's going to happen after ICC/Arthas, i said "the jailer appears and the shadowlands cinematic happens"
[2:47:58] deggon777: How do you feel overall about the exp Towel? I'm generally getting good vibes about it

[2:49:35] Mecabeast: starting to see stuff about yogg being important in drangonflight

[2:50:10] AnnieRabbets: @towelliee good afternoon
[2:50:16] AnnieRabbets: Hey chat
[2:50:34] Ithylz: Yeah the 2 dungeons were supposed to be an entire zone or something
[2:50:38] Kakotan2143: Hi ya Annie 👋
[2:50:45] mavericks312: you would have randy's raging lol
[2:50:51] raldrik: If they add new stuff to classic and not to retail people will riot
[2:50:54] AnnieRabbets: @kakotan2143 hey hey
[2:51:04] TheCliffyShow: This is something past Arthas. Ruby Sanctumn.
[2:51:05] JohntheBarbarian: do the OSRS thing and make new old content
[2:51:15] LearnedSomething: that would be awesome
[2:51:19] UniquePerson08: that sounds amazing
[2:51:20] LearnedSomething: very unblizzardlike, but awesome :)
[2:51:30] PrimalRain: that would be awesome, doubt it happens though
[2:51:34] FergusCreative: They just bought a studio didnt they?
[2:51:37] Verdell263: Do they HAVE to add it to retail though?
[2:51:48] LearnedSomething: they got the studio to push out DF in time
[2:51:52] mavericks312: @Verdell263 yes or there will be riots
[2:51:53] PBnJealous: They don't have to add it to retail. They could take the Runescape approach and make Classic and Retail 2 different games
[2:51:56] srze94: or they could continue with the future events happening (Cata, Mists, etc.) but without changing any of the Wrath systems :D
[2:52:03] chriar: @Verdell263 agreed, I dont think they have to add it to retail
[2:52:07] Rudric_Ice: wow has how many devs now both classic and retail altogether
[2:52:09] LearnedSomething: killed the game that studio was putting out when they bought them Sadge
[2:52:28] SLoPPYALieN: ... you mean there are phases?!?

[2:52:39] User3600: LUL got this mount on first try in legion when it just came out got lucky asfk
[2:52:44] TheCliffyShow: @shytam I heard that game wasn't doing to good.
[2:52:52] LearnedSomething: I never got this
[2:52:54] Squirrel_nutty: mount!
[2:53:04] duartz89: MANIFEST IT!
[2:53:04] chriar: @mavericks312 classic just becomes a different game like osr and runescape 3

[3:04:45] raldrik: someone at blizz having nervous shits
[3:04:53] pushnoir: Talked a bit to the rogue dev about this and he said he had 0 mandatory crunch this beta, kinda wild

[3:06:32] Poriand: I took vacation no delay plz lol

[3:07:06] neunmalelf: They will go the Microsoft way: Retail is the new Beta & hotfixes and weekly updates
[3:07:09] donin: they would rather release a completely broken game than delay it into december
[3:07:17] Y0urM0msBF: wait wait wait
[3:07:23] BMagicTX: @Towelliee What site do you think is best to check all your BiS wotlk gear?
[3:07:23] kokochris: last two weeks of Dec. is probably a no go due to lack of support
[3:07:26] Y0urM0msBF: whats wrong with Dragonflight?
[3:07:36] tedol: Blizzard can pull people from other projects to help wow team
[3:07:48] Dragonkiller1974: @neunmalelf they already do that
[3:07:51] Bulldawgx: @mahal_11532           towLets towGo TRIBE
[3:08:21] Mecabeast: and fines
[3:08:22] tedol: closer to billion with stock
[3:08:23] kokochris: @tedol to be honest that can only go so far.  ramp up time would make it not as effective
[3:08:38] BlazeBrainCapital: no
[3:08:44] Naturecold: Is there a good site for DF Talent Trees I can use on Beta?
[3:08:46] Molvonos: @tedol lol, no they cant.
[3:08:47] Pallyofhell: sometimes you have to lose some to win
[3:08:50] CptTeacake: They're not going to pull people from other projects that are probably also struggling

[3:09:32] jiffynuts: Did someone say doom and gloom and blizzard? Incoming Bellular video in 3…2…
[3:09:39] BlazeBrainCapital: Their stock woudl not suffer at all if they delayed it.  If you dont understand how stocks work you might think that.
[3:09:45] Herzenliegen: @pallyofhell would you say the same if it was your billions of dollars?
[3:09:49] livid21: If blizz knew there were a lot of bugs, why didn’t they preemptively announce they would release the expansion later?
[3:09:56] BlazeBrainCapital: but it wouldnt impact it at all.. or if it did,m very briefly

[3:10:09] instant_savage: that muchb for a montyh delay or if its longer than a month
[3:10:13] Mahal_11532: The price would fall, but then it would go up when they do realize their earnings when it actually releases. You only lose money if you sell your shares or execute options, so it kind of depends
[3:10:14] Pallyofhell: well if i knew the added time to make it a polished product then yea
[3:10:15] duffluv22: Do you think Evoker day 1 pre patch?
[3:10:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: dozens of yachts lost
[3:10:17] Troniin: how bad do you think the pandemic hurt shadowlands development?
[3:10:20] BMagicTX: Any tips? could really use some help @Towelliee

[3:11:17] BMagicTX: @Towelliee What site do you think is best to check all your BiS wotlk gear?
[3:11:20] Pallyofhell: isnt this the last quarter for activison
[3:11:28] Kakotan2143: Last few months i have given Blizzard a lot of money compared to what i have available cause i know how hard things must be the last few months
[3:11:29] CptTeacake: I guess it depends how well OW2 is doing, maybe it would give them some leeway?
[3:11:34] rensdeamo: Stock price is fixed with the MS buy
[3:11:39] Kakotan2143: Loon addon is Wrath BIS addon
[3:11:41] Ithylz: They could delay 1 month, couldn't they? That would make a December releassse
[3:11:43] mavericks312: id like to hear from ion when he thinks DF should release
[3:11:44] BMagicTX: Yes
[3:11:44] PokerFaceMoose: warcraft tavern
[3:11:47] Ithylz: release*
[3:11:52] tedol: Activision stock dropping for last 3 months, they can't delay
[3:11:54] BMagicTX: its just cause that plus icy viens pluis wowhead all say different
[3:11:58] smashwow: i just think overall it's a bad look to have the specs they have in shambles, but they start out the process for DF saying it'll launch when it's ready.
[3:12:02] Ithylz: True
[3:12:08] EmpathyLiveChat: If they delayed to 2023, little Johnny wouldn't get his Dragonflight for Christmas
[3:12:12] Pallyofhell: activision will not delay it
[3:12:18] smashwow: yeah it's going to launch 11.28 regardless
[3:12:24] Pallyofhell: they want whatever money they can get from the release
[3:12:26] Bayne77: christmas is cancelled this year!
[3:12:30] Rudric_Ice: DF is fine they aint gonna delay shit
[3:12:34] duffluv22: Do you think there will be Evoker day 1 of prepatch?
[3:12:38] Addetetet: I´ve been wondering about what professions I´d like for dragonflight. Do you know if renown farming will be for recipes? Or do they drop somewhere else?
[3:12:45] MR_WYTE: I take a couple weeks of Christmas PTO every year. Couldn’t pay me enough not to.
[3:12:57] SLoPPYALieN: @duffluv22 Nope.. not day one. It's been said that it'll be a two phase prepatch.
[3:12:59] smashwow: ghost town blizz until after 1/1
[3:13:01] Updul: But Daddy Gates will be not happy with a delay
[3:13:01] BlewGamingGroup: its a skeleton crew ... just enough people to turn the lights on

[3:13:18] AlterAngelus: when is acti/blizzard fiscal year/quarter end? Calendar year doesn't matter except the prospect of losing holiday sales.
[3:13:25] Pallyofhell: @duffluv22 they never said what phase though
[3:13:26] Kakotan2143: they wont do that after all the problems the Blizzard team has had with the personnel, so they gotta have let them on vacation
[3:13:29] duffluv22: @sloppyalien O.ok..thank you. I can plan my work schedule
[3:13:29] BlewGamingGroup: its literally the interns

[3:13:36] RRspud: Skeleton crew?
[3:13:40] smashwow: i mean lets be clear. how it launches mostly is how it will be until 10.1 or 10.2 for a lot of these classes.

[3:47:40] Molvonos: @TheCliffyShow dragons can do whatever they want
[3:47:40] r0b928: Wait is the expansion called dragon flight or dragon isles? I thought it was isles
[3:47:47] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee what are you doing to get them readY?
[3:47:55] Thoreya: @r0b928 dragonflight
[3:47:56] GamingDad77: @r0b928 Flight
[3:47:59] Featherbow: @r0b928 flight. Dragon Isles is the new zone
[3:48:01] Rudric_Ice: wish i was a dragon
[3:48:11] JeffreyVegas: LOL NOT A CHANCE!!!
[3:48:16] r0b928: Huh interesting
[3:48:27] TheCliffyShow: I still think Dragonflight is a dumb name.
[3:48:29] lurker198: definitely doesn't work that way lol, otherwise one could simply drink water and fully sober up
[3:48:32] AusterePanic: it would still be the same volume of alcohol
[3:48:48] Epiclurker27893: isn't that why bartenders shake the drinks before serving it?
[3:49:03] whiskytrix: alcohol is alcohol, these people are imbecile's
[3:49:08] Molvonos: If you take 1 shot of Tequila, put half a shot in one glass, half a shot in the other, and then pour water into both shot glasses, that's Dilution.
[3:49:15] r0b928: There is the same amount of alcohol by the ABV is less
[3:49:17] GamingDad77: @Epiclurker27893 that's for proper mixing.
[3:49:23] RaysFTW: It's the same amount of alcohol but the volume is halved.
[3:49:29] Molvonos: If you take a full shot of tequila and put water in it, that's just shitty tequila.
[3:49:41] JeffreyVegas: I brew alcohol btw. If you drink 1 shot of tequila or a shot of tequila with 2 oz of water... it is still 1 oz of tequila... Their trying to say that it would thin your blood with adding the water... That would take about liter of water.
[3:49:53] lurker198: if you only take one of the shots, its dilution - otherwise its just pointless
[3:50:09] SLoPPYALieN: It's only less ABV as the volume has increased as result of adding more liquid. Still the same amount of alcohol.
[3:50:29] JeffreyVegas: @SLoPPYALieN yoyogaDUDE exactly
[3:50:33] AusterePanic: it takes approx an hour to process a beer or shot of liquor
[3:50:43] Alaquane: I think they're being technical / literal / pedantic with ABV specifically
[3:50:51] r0b928: @sloppyalien exactly
[3:50:52] blornj: If a shot of whiskey is traveling from the table to your mouth at 3 ft/sec and your first shot of tequila is traveling down your throat at a speed 2 ft/sec, what is the rate at which you are getting plastered?
[3:50:53] BlewGamingGroup: true
[3:50:56] cyberratt: thrash swipe mangle ironfur
[3:50:58] cyberratt: done
[3:50:59] KingSlayerYotam: bear is like 4 keys
[3:51:04] Quojin: theyre getting volume of liquid confused with content of alcohol
[3:51:04] Xerbear: As a sad bear main, yes
[3:51:10] RaysFTW: If you have 2 ounces of 50% abv and add 2 ounces of water, you're effectively making it 25% abv because it's by volume, which is now 4 ounces. Same amount of alcohol as when you started but the abv is halved.
[3:51:13] TweektheProphet: yeah more or less.
[3:51:14] Molvonos: Bears are boring as fuck, it's the only reason I stopped playing my Druid.  Boring rotations, boring appearance since you cant see armor, it's just Meh.
[3:51:18] GamingDad77: @quiet_toad towStop towIt lol

[5:55:26] TheTimoBern: @zgag seconded
[5:55:28] Daarksyde: @Towelliee honest question: do you think Blizz targets certain classes/specs to do high dps/hps than others in each expac/patch or is it always an attempt to balance all?
[5:55:28] Slippage_: More bugs than grounded LUL
[5:55:29] Pallyofhell: they turned it off cause the community cant be trusted LUL
[5:55:32] warrenny: @princessaww This is in 10 days

[5:56:37] DM_Hakai: DM_Hakai subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Yooo
[5:56:42] jetributions: I don't see sharkbait

[5:56:57] Slippage_: They sent so many staff members to put out the overwatch 2 server launch fires they forgot to leave someone behind to start the ptr LUL
[5:56:58] zgag: I'm guessing beta is going to end on 10/25?  With the prepatch release
[5:57:04] DM_Hakai: Is pre patch 25 october?
[5:57:13] zgag: Or maybe couple weeks after
[5:57:16] TheUnknowing: No @zgag it will go through release
[5:57:31] twinkieruler95: what surver are you on?
[5:57:34] Aidler: @dm_hakai that’s the public consensus
[5:57:37] TollBoothVideos: I'm giving up on PTR, I'm going to eat lunch and shower.... probably means we will get the quest as soon as I go afk...
[5:57:42] Nokterian: The fact that dragonflight is going a bit more back to basics thats why im excited
[5:57:45] Malarick: WoW devs probably farming in NW and lost track of time.
[5:57:57] yaashs: Aw man, Tony passed away

[6:00:30] Nokterian: cool
[6:00:51] Aidler: you: “nothing is happening?” blizz:”yeah, that’s the prepatch event. back to the roots baby”…. naguuraGiggle
[6:00:52] neo_0098: they have to delay dragonflight there is absolutely no Chance that they will fix all of the issues currently on the beta
[6:00:54] Featherbow: @GamingDad77 it's a random drop from timewalking bosses
[6:01:00] Amarlian: I am sure that someone is just running with the USB drive any time now
[6:01:03] ReaverXTV: Blizz the first feedback on the forum (torm enhanced mob being too strong or too weak) .. but it hasn't started yet.. KEKW

[6:05:23] JeffreyVegas: Its not the breakers doing... The companies know who the big breakers are and send loaded product to them knowing its free advertizing. Wizards of the Coast Knows exactly what cards are in each box of Magic The Gathering. Im sure Panini does as well.
[6:05:31] zgag: I can join the siege battle now. Is that part of the PTR deal?

[7:11:47] Noflameofc1: Isn't it kind of crazy that there's no cooler looking weapon/shield then thunderfury/Bulwark of Azzinoth?
[7:11:59] muzicz: Ill gift someone who tells me the value on invincible reins atm
[7:12:07] Herzenliegen: Question, where does it say that pre patch is releasing Oct 25th?
[7:12:15] xejai: Dude brewmaster getting 4% avoidance and 8% healing for 10 yards as passives is NUTS.
[7:12:25] Molvonos: @Noflameofc1 Anything's better looking than Thunderfury.  You right about Bulwark tho
[7:12:29] xejai: Like that has to be absolutely bis.
[7:12:34] xSoldierhardx: @Towelliee are mobs dropping decent essence or 1-2 only
[7:12:41] Exxcar: @Herzenliegen The leak which has been 100% on everything Blizzard in the last 4 months
[7:12:53] Exxcar: Is what people are basing Oct 25th on
[7:12:55] Noflameofc1: @Noflameofc1 Oh man thunderfury has no equal
[7:13:18] szble: I mean season ends the 25th too

[7:13:30] Rictamar: so not a stretch to believe that
[7:13:47] Noflameofc1: But in my opinion it's kind of crazy that there's no better looking stuff. It's been what like over 15 years?
[7:13:58] zoltargg2: its kinda sad how alot of streamers gonna stay on lichking and not switch dragonflight
[7:14:02] iamspacemanspiff: got 39 of the primals and 2 pieces of loot so far
[7:14:05] Herzenliegen: @Exxcar So people are thinking that season 4 ends on the 25th and the pre patch all happens on the same day?

[7:31:34] Todmeister9000: I am going to use it and I am sane
[7:31:36] Thoreya: bc elvui makes my shit lag hard
[7:31:37] The_U1timatum: I really like the new ui
[7:31:38] Herzenliegen: I'll believe it's 10 days when they post the release date saying it.
[7:31:42] Collected1: i've always been a classic UI user. i wish i could revert back to it.
[7:31:43] infinityarty: wait whats wrong with the ui?

[7:32:35] tiyanigean: I like the new UI, ElvUI always looked whack to me. sprinkle platerf or enemy bars on top. e voila
[7:32:40] Hyelander_: @Hyeland3r Thats good to know. thank you
[7:32:41] mush80: Evoker will 99% come out with pre patch. Guess they wouldn't give it out now so people could focus on the event and not the evoker

[7:49:15] DisparagingTurtle: It all depends what that buff is though
[7:49:21] Rudric_Ice: is that fully upgraded ?
[7:49:22] LegoCoin: I wonder if you have to level it or if you get it at max level?
[7:49:23] danksly: make the wood ele an mount 10/10
[7:49:37] Shurn_82: @LegoCoin most heirlooms ajust to level of toon

[7:50:04] LegoCoin: @Shurn_82  just wondering if it has to be upgraded

[7:50:22] WolfofWarSong: just tuned in whats the ilvl dropping?
[7:50:31] instant_savage: is the tmog lookin good atleast?
[7:50:37] OrganicJKW: 252 gear is a massive upgrade for new evokers just finishing their story zone.
[7:50:38] muzicz: @Towelliee Did I tell you I came back to raid with my old raid team in SL on a Prot Pally and it was the easiest thing Ive ever done :P

[7:51:14] Justintegra31: I didn't think Evokers could leave their starter zone until launch
[7:51:20] LegoCoin: agreed for transmogs, etc would be nice
[7:51:22] Shurn_82: @LegoCoin ohhhh I get you brother! yea, likely in wow fashion its a gold sink to upgrade
[7:51:25] LegoCoin: save on some time
[7:51:31] gra5per: what about the currency? BoP?

[7:51:50] WolfofWarSong: you can go to shadowlands if you want theres a portal
[7:51:50] nesman27: plate set from the event is nice, its got cartoony dark souls vibes lol
[7:51:51] mattb0mb: Hmm, I wonder what ilvl Uldaman drops.
[7:51:53] muzicz: Im super intrested to see how resto Evokers will be, I think it will feel like monks
[7:51:54] neo1702: there is no m+ in the prepatch lol
[7:52:03] danksly: you can join a covenant on evoker and get a generic cov power same for all
[7:52:13] xmedpakx: any pet or mount tied to the prepatch? i am down for xmogs but i love me some mounts and stuff
[7:52:16] OrganicJKW: @muzicz MW feels very different.
[7:52:18] choobtasticc: M+ is awesome
[7:52:21] Rudric_Ice: @neo1702 u can get KSM till launch
[7:52:21] Bullentor: meh?

[7:52:43] Theliahh: @neo1702 there is always M+ in prepatch
[7:52:44] xmedpakx: @neo1702 sad
[7:52:47] Molvonos: FML, as much as I want to play evoker, maaan... their tier set looks so bad and I'm not feeling the watered down dragon-form armor anymore.
[7:52:52] megrahh99: @muzicz Thanks for the gift sub!
[7:52:53] neo1702: @rudric_ice nope with season 4 Ending you cant get the KSM
[7:52:55] Thoreya: i think this bugged version is better
[7:52:58] choobtasticc: It’s Blizzard… it’s not 10 days away
[7:52:59] Thoreya: than SL bugs

[7:53:17] LegoCoin: but still going to enjoy it
[7:53:24] emarol_dk: and the UI is so bugged
[7:53:26] spicykekw: at least is a completely new experience. being bugged differently feels better
[7:53:27] LegoCoin: I personaly like bugs LOL
[7:53:28] moa285: We are not complete. FeelsBadMan
[7:53:28] danksly: nice long prepatch to get the kinks out Bedge

[7:53:41] D3m0nHunt3r666: Kappa
[7:53:41] YinYangMan77: This xpac doesn't exist for my Ret Paladin...yet.
[7:53:42] RuthlessWelshy: no ofc they cant no where near enough time

[7:53:51] roflpotamus: LMAO
[7:53:51] Alacod: Their not gonna delay like SL the Backlasah on that was huge
[7:53:51] Collected1: they could still push to 2023
[7:53:53] instant_savage: where fucked
[7:53:56] sapphoclock: its a shame that this prepatch seems like kind of an afterthought
[7:53:57] Twizted23faith: "Ship it"
[7:54:06] srze94: Name of the expac: "The Bug Reporter Is Bugged" :D
[7:54:07] GegaBites: Another BFA like launch
[7:54:07] choobtasticc: Lol
[7:54:07] OrganicJKW: @muzicz MW now primarily plays like disc where your damage is doing most of your healing. Preservation does healing through damage on only one long cd spell if talented.
[7:54:09] AureliusXV: Doom3r
[7:54:09] Qwevin1: Pre patch is actully beta test 2.0
[7:54:10] Alacod: They're*
[7:54:11] Celwind: Kappa
[7:54:14] JeffreyVegas: solornCry solornCry solornCry
[7:54:15] neo1702: @collected1 they cant bobby needs a new yacht
[7:54:16] Fappy23: still no work order for professions
[7:54:16] captiv8: I mean prepatch is basically everyone testing for blizz. It is what it is. I bet everyone still plays regardless
[7:54:20] NeWkLeaR1992: What’s the pre patch event?
[7:54:21] Ety_TV: do you think pre-patch is coming on 25.10?
[7:54:22] Poriand: its friday so prob no more updates?
[7:54:23] Justintegra31: where does it say it's a release candidate?
[7:54:23] instant_savage: there gonna end season 4, and then delay and its gonna be real bad cause we wont have anything to do
[7:54:24] RuthlessWelshy: Kappa
[7:54:24] LegoCoin: pre-release candidate LUL
[7:54:27] Yagr6: can we get a new bug reporter to report that the bug reporter is bugged LUL
[7:54:28] Justintegra31: I don't see that in my launcher
[7:54:28] ralecgos: it's feeling very cyberpunk 2077
[7:54:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: can't have more bugs to fix if you break the bug reporter big brain move by blizzard
[7:54:29] xSoldierhardx: @Towelliee the experience drop isnt even implimenteted for 50-60
[7:54:30] The_Dane_Train: Looks like it’s a working weekend.
[7:54:32] moa285: It's gonna be fine. towCopium
[7:54:33] flebbooo: towBlind what the hell is going on
[7:54:33] Exxcar: This build is from Oct 7 I'm sure there are many builds since then that they just haven't released yet for xyz
[7:54:34] mitchumtx: @Qwevin1 prepatch is technically open beta KEKW
[7:54:34] CaspinTV: This Is Fine
[7:54:42] BG_Plays: !DF

[7:54:43] donhorse: i hope they realese the fkn pre patch this month or else
[7:54:44] CLOUDSOFF: The only thing that delaying the xpac does is make the game better, which in return makes the players happier....
[7:54:47] Exxcar: (You can see the date on the bottom left of login screen)
[7:54:48] Xelim27: i personally dont think season 4 end = pre-patch. i think pre-patch will dollow up a week after S4 end.  2 weeks of phase 1 prepatch and 1 week of phase 2 pre patch (evokers) followed by DF release @Towelliee
[7:54:49] Rudric_Ice: maybe we wont get prepatch at 25th
[7:54:51] neo1702: maybe this is the prepatch of the prepatch?
[7:54:52] Qwevin1: @mitchumtx true
[7:55:01] c0mmander_starscream: fucking idiot grubhub driver delivered my food to another house
[7:55:36] Joemercy_: You sir! Are not crazy
[7:55:40] instant_savage: it should 4 weeks, 1 week for eacxh aspect and each week is themed around that aspect
[7:55:42] Herzenliegen: @Xelim27 see I'm thinking the same thing
[7:56:02] Shurn_82: 5 weeks till the release right
[7:56:16] Shurn_82: yea maybe a week later than we projected
[7:56:17] LegoCoin: what level to do pre-patch event?
[7:56:31] The_Dane_Train: But why bother ending the season
[7:56:31] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[7:56:33] WolfofWarSong: they announced end of season though, the last 2 expansions the end of season was same day as prepatch
[7:56:37] choobtasticc: I remember at BlizzCon that Dev Mike M.. saying they have five expansion packs like in a revolver. All they need to do is pull the trigger.…. LOL
[7:56:41] runiih: so, they will really keep going with  this release date ahn lol
[7:56:43] Alacod: 2 weeks is like 2days in dev
[7:56:47] Shurn_82: wonder if you can boost with the prepatch events
[7:56:49] Artful_Dodger: @LegoCoin Mobs scale down to your level.
[7:57:17] Collected1: i think we all need to prepare ourselves for a lot of broken stuff over the next few months
[7:57:30] Shurn_82: @LegoCoin i figured it would only go so low...ill try it tonight
[7:57:33] Aidler: what ilvl does a character need to go into DF? asking for my alts…
[7:57:33] Toon11: LUL
[7:57:39] BlewGamingGroup: that sucks cause the prepatch is the best time to max level the character
[7:57:44] Shurn_82: @Collected1 my heart and head are broken...that count
[7:57:54] duffluv22: Can we get a pre patch announcement
[7:57:56] PatchMyEye: @Tamanaotsu where did you hear this?
[7:58:01] Zucchey: @Towelliee What's that fire mount
[7:58:03] runiih: they should for christ sake release it on january
[7:58:05] neo1702: you will only gain access to the evokers in the prepatch if you preordered the epic Version of dragonflight
[7:58:05] Xelim27: i think evoker will be the last thing to be added in prepatch just so ppl create them, get em to 60 and have them ready for df release
[7:58:08] Artful_Dodger: Even the bug report button is still AWOL
[7:58:11] pushnoir: Depends on class, I played a rogue in SL and we had like 30 bugs by the end of beta and some bugs were actually just never fixed during all of SL
[7:58:27] 91Niki: Talents however
[7:58:28] Rudric_Ice: @Zucchey recruitment mount
[7:58:34] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Tamanaotsu (warning)
[7:58:37] xmedpakx: delay till dec release raid in jan   hehe
[7:58:38] danksly: monkaSoap
[7:58:42] LegoCoin: I hope we have bug that makes us stand in a line and take turns LUL
[7:58:45] instant_savage: @Towelliee  does sentinal work yet
[7:58:52] Bullentor: whats the rewards of pre patch?
[7:58:56] choobtasticc: Our friends and family services more advanced then PTR?
[7:58:57] Dreadfrost: @Towelliee tbh talents and characters can be more easily patched along the way
[7:58:57] 91Niki: https://blizzardwatch.com/2022/10/10/dragonflight-pre-patch-2/
[7:58:59] MOLAR305: did you see RSGlotyandgold passed away?
[7:58:59] Exxcar: https://blizzardwatch.com/2022/10/10/dragonflight-pre-patch-2/
[7:58:59] InvokeGaming: they cant delay at this point
[7:59:02] MoodyVanessa: @neo1702 the version doesnt matter you only have to preorder any of them
[7:59:03] neo1702: @bullentor nothing
[7:59:07] YinYangMan77: Not all of them.  But mine is... NotLikeThis
[7:59:07] Tamanaotsu: Cheers
[7:59:24] romann921: will preparch be rdy in 2 weeks?
[7:59:28] neo1702: @bullentor and thats not even a joke
[7:59:29] instant_savage: @Towelliee  is there a cool spell animation when u cast sentinal
[7:59:30] domdomz: pre patch will be used to bug test talents honestly
[7:59:43] d0mezg4mer: maybe a massive pile of bug fixes will hit in the next couple weeks and everything will be fine?
[7:59:44] Thoreya: oomgggggggggggg
[7:59:49] Thoreya: I WANNA MAKE MY EVOKER MAN
[7:59:53] Justintegra31: That link states that Evokers will not be able to leave their starter zones until launch
[7:59:58] Justintegra31: I smell ambiguity
[8:00:04] ZaderRaider: I keep hearing there’s tons of talent bugs. Which classes are struggling the most?
[8:00:04] Exxcar: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-interview-with-judgehype-pre-patch-event-dracthyr-questline-mythic-326780
[8:00:14] sycnessx: omg u can make tauren rogues :D
[8:00:17] Herzenliegen: Fix their UI
[8:00:19] Toon11: that kind of makes sense
[8:00:21] Rudric_Ice: NO SCALY DRAGON FUCK
[8:00:31] Etzli_GG: just give us all the content alreadyyyyy
[8:00:33] HoppsiDejsi: but they arelasy saod Evokers come with the event
[8:00:37] Thoreya: omg that post
[8:00:41] ventu105: so October 25 no dracktyr
[8:00:42] Thoreya: about progression lol
[8:00:42] doomserr: that link says evokers wont be able to leave their starting zone
[8:00:46] DoughBoi_Trev: pre patch is out?????
[8:00:47] LegoCoin: not sure schedule needs to be a suprise at this put they should just tell us LUL
[8:00:47] remixonfire91: how do we start the pre patch stuff on PTR just go to one of the zones?
[8:00:51] 91Niki: @Rudric_Ice No judgement if you're into that kinda stuff, but no need to share it openly here Kappa
[8:00:53] Thoreya: No Azerite/Artifact Power system is planned for Dragonflight. A progression system is expected to be included, but player feedback from Battle for Azeroth and Shadowlands is being considered.
[8:00:58] Zucchey: That fire horse looks dope
[8:01:01] acehornet2: so what we getting the 25th
[8:01:06] Exxcar: @LegoCoin They probably still haven't finalized it yet
[8:01:09] DoughBoi_Trev: So prepatch is out now???
[8:01:19] d0mezg4mer: just new talents?
[8:01:21] Carahail: @DoughBoi_Trev no,ptr
[8:01:22] Tyrolore: PTR
[8:01:23] Amarlian: @DoughBoi_Trev PTR
[8:01:25] LegoCoin: @Exxcar  thats my guess too
[8:01:36] WolfofWarSong: yeah i think the 25th we get prepatch talents and shit 2 weeks to fuck around
[8:01:36] DoughBoi_Trev: @amarlian well shiiiiit
[8:01:37] Korupcija_: new thing every week
[8:01:42] pikacho000: what are we waiting for here
[8:01:48] Tamanaotsu: 25th talents Ui etc
[8:01:51] bruce_almighty: i need prepatch to be long  i'm levelling up new toons so they don't have SL stink on them
[8:02:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: towCopium
[8:02:03] MoodyVanessa: but if prepatch isnt on the 25th why would they extend KSM and end the season earlier than prepatch ?
[8:02:07] Rudric_Ice: @Rudric_Ice ayo im not into that stuff
[8:02:09] Shurn_82: @Justintegra31 The break down on blizz app says pretty much "Available at or before launch) so who really knows haha
[8:02:09] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[8:02:17] acehornet2: call your people tow we need answers
[8:02:22] Xelim27: based on beta, evokers at least to me seems ready to be released
[8:02:25] Holysal: NW XD
[8:02:29] Korupcija_: only 3 weeks KEKW
[8:02:33] Amarlian: I really hope evokers are with pre patch day, I think if it isn't planned to, they should have a post about it now to set expectations
[8:02:35] xSoldierhardx: @WildAllie ive gone 50-53 in 1hr on retail right now just questing
[8:02:39] Rudric_Ice: can u call up ION bruh or i can just play NW
[8:02:51] Thoreya: NW LUL
[8:03:09] Exxcar: @Amarlian ??? We know nothing about pre-patch schedule officialy yet. If you're setting expectations that's your fault
[8:03:19] Justintegra31: I think Evokers will be available day 1 of prepatch, but all you will be able to do is customization and the starter zone experience.
[8:03:26] Justintegra31: you won't be able to bring them out into the world
[8:03:35] Holysal: just in time for NW fresh servers
[8:03:36] Exxcar: When they officially announce pre-patch, that's when you should set expectations
[8:03:42] deggon777: have to do with the colts and marvel snap crossover?

[8:05:51] Respls: yeah i just gave up
[8:05:57] Rudric_Ice: get on your 500 achievement mount Tow

[8:08:37] Rudric_Ice: it would've been cool if Ragnaros came back out of nowhere from this prepatch event Kappa
[8:08:41] Celwind: Yup! Now my eyes hurt too
[8:08:43] LegoCoin: yeah wow - Encoder crapped out too causes stream to go pixelated
[8:08:44] Rictamar: there are people on the PTR literally trying to defend this...how can we test when the release candidate build is bugged??
[8:08:50] Malicone: pre patch event?

[8:16:59] Amarlian: @Exxcar I guess after rereading my comment, it was a little hotter than I meant it. truthfully, I do not feel entitled to anything so whatever they do they will do. I was more thinking about the complaints they would receive if they do not communicate, but they officially announce other prepatch dates only days before they dropped. I just wish they would be more forth coming since everyone already assumes that prepatch will be in 10 days
[8:17:18] Amarlian: well 11 days
[8:17:35] Justintegra31: THis is the longest rum and coke break ever
[8:17:35] Amarlian: I know that can change in a drop of the hat

[8:17:39] Justintegra31: is he making a gallon?
[8:18:27] ilskarius: Well it is friday
[8:18:28] ilskarius: KEKW
[8:18:56] 91Niki: I think the reason behind waiting with announcing the date is to be 100% sure it is ready. If you announce the date and then suddenly realize it isn't ready, then you stand with a lot of angry people when you suddenly delay it
[8:19:00] Celwind: TPFufun SeemsGood
[8:19:22] Bsirk: @Justintegra31 Probably turned into a Run n Coke & Shit break
[8:19:45] Bsirk: ans he's back!
[8:20:13] Holysal: 25 Million for OW2 not bad
[8:20:13] Amarlian: @91Niki Sure, but isn't it better to say something about the season ending but prepatch hasn't been announced rather than just let the assumption run?
[8:20:17] Unciatim: what Rum?
[8:20:23] Herzenliegen: towBeer

[8:20:57] 91Niki: @Amarlian Blizzard doesn't really care about assumptions and speculations like that. It doesn't impact their game or company
[8:21:05] Unciatim: ahhh.. Good man...
[8:21:05] dschmidt: @Towelliee can you show your talents please?
[8:21:26] dschmidt: thank you
[8:21:30] 91Niki: Similar to how speculations about next expansion after DF doesn't impact them
[8:21:32] Texas_Mizfit: @Towelliee I can heal if your guild is short a healer.
[8:21:53] Amarlian: @91Niki true, and it's not like I really read the forums or reddit for complaining anyway so what do I care in the end.
[8:22:03] Unciatim: have you tried the XO and Negra yet?
[8:22:20] GegaBites: WA works on PTR?
[8:22:20] Outsane: diurna
[8:22:28] Justintegra31: @Towelliee what do you think the easiest class is for a person wanting to start tanking for the first time in DF?
[8:22:40] Outsane: err sorry dathea
[8:23:21] 91Niki: @Amarlian I am in the, "I don't care when it is, as long as they do their best to make it release ready" boat. Most people who complain on the forums have very little understanding of how game development works.
[8:23:59] Lassitude1k1: War Front table outside war chief building if you've not seen btw
[8:24:04] Justintegra31: And I"m the opposite. I want it now, even if it is a hair buggy. As long as it is playable
[8:24:17] luriosbael: are guardian druids supposed to have 30s cd on convoke?
[8:24:18] crittinkitten: @Justintegra31 druid tank is the most simple. choosing a tank that you think looks fun will always be a better choice though, if you're more interested in playing you'll get better faster
[8:24:33] Lassitude1k1: yeah, assuming they'll use it for the events
[8:24:33] zeeAbe: @Towelliee do you want to do warfronts though?
[8:24:38] Amarlian: @91Niki makes sense to me. That is why I made the comment about me coming in a little hot. I was really just missing when they used to talk more back in the ghost crawler days
[8:24:39] 91Niki: @Justintegra31 Might wanna get that wow addiction checked out mate :p
[8:24:48] Justintegra31: yeah, the problem is that the playerbase is BRUTAL against tanks that aren't great
[8:25:26] Agk90_: when the pre-patch drops?
[8:25:26] Amarlian: That's forever with every class

[8:26:29] Justintegra31: So how does someone get started tanking when everyone shits on them when they are trying to learn?
[8:26:38] erendir: @Towelliee hey man! just started lvling my dps evoker! have any tips on a m+ build that is good to use? ty!

[8:26:46] woodythehuman: What tank specs are going to be meta
[8:26:54] 91Niki: @Justintegra31 Yeah, sadly a lot of the wow community is very toxic towards new players like that :( it sucks
[8:27:16] zeeAbe: You mean even after the affix rework?
[8:27:23] Sielu11628: M+ weekend. Yes
[8:27:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: spirit of mythic + Kappa
[8:27:31] dschmidt: @Justintegra31 In all honesty you need a premade with people that want to help you
[8:27:31] Holysal: Guardians going to win
[8:27:37] chickdrummer88: Sup @Towelliee and chat
[8:27:48] Texas_Mizfit: will judge get his 4th strikeout
[8:27:53] 91Niki: @chickdrummer88 ijpH ijpHI
[8:28:01] mattb0mb: Wait, the stun is really 8 secs?
[8:28:03] dschmidt: @Justintegra31 The majority of the player base is so toxic, they think they are MDI'ers
[8:28:05] Ezareal: I think matching the buffs then giving the dmg and heal buff would be overall better
[8:28:08] potatowarrior411: its very anti pug for sure
[8:28:25] Thoreya: what dungeons we testing this weekend??!
[8:28:28] Thoreya: my weekend is made

[8:52:04] Holysal: @Rudric_Ice Alpha KEKW
[8:52:09] Justintegra31: damage is much more managable this time
[8:53:14] 91Niki: Oooo that's a cool mechanic
[8:53:27] Justintegra31: This is going to be a nightmare in LFR
[8:53:29] LegoCoin: AGREED ^^'
[8:53:37] Rudric_Ice: Alpha HOLY GIGACHAD
[8:53:44] LegoCoin: knock to adds is cool
[8:54:00] Haotududis: So you mean you don't require a lock to get over there this time? 🤔
[8:54:20] Justintegra31: It's going to have to be nerfed into the ground

[8:54:26] BlewGamingGroup: by paying for a carry
[8:54:26] 91Niki: I'd imagine on LFR it just boots you over there without needing the add?
[8:54:27] Nokterian: LUL
[8:54:27] Athinzi: With grace as always.
[8:54:28] Dcarter: Lock probability enables some cheat code method
[8:54:30] cannibalcanyon: is this mechanic in lfr?
[8:54:31] WundertueteGER: they gonna be PainChamp
[8:54:35] LegoCoin: LFR probably wont have to kill adds
[8:54:41] Rudric_Ice: I bet they remove the whole mechanic
[8:54:49] 91Niki: Or that yeah
[8:54:49] Daarksyde: just like Hal, it will be hilarious
[8:54:56] Justintegra31: naw. It'll be there
[8:54:59] 91Niki: Oh it's a tank debuff
[8:55:03] dwolters_the_zombieman: i wonder when the boss does the aoe if you have to bestacked on the boss

[9:07:42] DaveyDingDong: New to the game - I just reached level 40 on hunter bm - not feeling the class. What class would you recommend for getting up close and personal?
[9:07:51] Aro725: Ret Stonks UP{
[9:08:01] abracka_: @DaveyDingDong fury warrior or ret paladin
[9:08:11] Etzli_GG: @DaveyDingDong Have you tried survival hunter?
[9:08:17] cannibalcanyon: @Lostdogal google.
[9:08:18] Alaquane: bears could probably wild charge / interrupt ?
[9:08:22] abracka_: @DaveyDingDong yeah you can also try survival, it's melee
[9:08:27] Etzli_GG: WW monk is a lot of fun too
[9:08:35] rogulttv: evokers can fly you back in :)
[9:08:39] Rynzler88: Bear (skull bash / wild charge)
[9:08:43] instant_savage: can brewmaster use clash
[9:08:48] instant_savage: is that still a thing
[9:08:53] Lostdogal: @Lostdogal sure
[9:09:00] DecayedmiNt: We dont even get skull bash as a bear OMEGALUL
[9:09:01] Bayne77: they have wild charge as well
[9:09:03] Rynzler88: Ideally the leap tanks are probably best
[9:09:04] Alaquane: oh yeah. for sure. Just thinking bears might be able to do it if they really tried
[9:09:06] DecayedmiNt: WE skip it
[9:09:09] DaveyDingDong: survival - I didn't think of that. I'll give that a go and see how I go
[9:09:17] DaveyDingDong: Thanks @abracka_
[9:09:28] Rynzler88: well you wouldn't be skipping it if you were the main platform tank here probably
[9:10:13] rogulttv: @Towelliee just get an evoker to fly you back
[9:10:53] rogulttv: or priest grip
[9:11:45] Alaquane: towOof

[9:13:22] Dcarter: I like that kinda stuff
[9:13:29] Dcarter: Why I love star augur
[9:13:43] BrandonB21: theres a difference of being hard and being so hard it turns into a niche thing
[9:13:45] BlewGamingGroup: thats the way it should be . personal responsibility . if someone stands in a mechanic .. they die . and they learn not to do that again .. not wipe 30 people
[9:14:14] Dcarter: Well the raid is one thing right so kinda should but I see both sides

[9:30:25] Alaquane: Boss should be named Noctua
[9:30:48] Bestcat00: Mctwist
[9:31:09] Sephirothxz: Is lock bad in df?
[9:31:17] mayonaes: lock is strong
[9:31:25] infamoustuna: How bad is Spriest?

[9:35:07] DhioGaming: towGift
[9:35:08] Alaquane: the chile limon isn't a lightweight on heat. it builds up after a while.
