[1:46:18] bignerdtv: student loans can help build credit, IF you make payments on time
[1:46:28] Yliza: Strange how that works in the US. In most of Europe it is like the other side around. Don't use credit cards kekw
[1:46:29] interdimensionalDave: Debt always bad. save and invest. unless you need the money urgently, then get a loan and never miss a payment
[1:47:00] interdimensionalDave: i started at 15 and im now 23 with a 720 credit score and 150k net worth
[1:47:03] SiriusSkold: Finally a solid advice on twitch. Good for you dude
[1:47:11] interdimensionalDave: makin 15/hr
[1:47:25] SiriusSkold: Im a random here but kids listen to this guy. Im in my 30s and his right
[1:47:44] protokol21: @Swifty I paid off my student loans and my credit score went down 40points
[1:48:12] Rando1988: mic muted
[1:48:29] Boroborgeran: BegWan
[1:48:36] Xerannu: I paid off my car the other month and it went down 15 pts lol
[1:48:44] bignerdtv: having debt can help push your score up if you still establish credit
[1:48:46] protokol21: yea cause I basically closed 3 accounts
[1:48:47] MortalasTV: my student loans were forgiven and my score went up like 29 points
[1:48:52] SynistorTV: @protokol21 sadly that can happen. when you pay off any type of loan and you dont have other old loans on your score it can affect your score due to age of loans against you
[1:48:57] protokol21: its like closing an old credit card
[1:48:58] SiriusSkold: I cant either but been working my head off for 5 years (last 3 as a medical scientist) now im at a point i can browse housing options
[1:49:16] king_king10: what a bad system
[1:49:29] mattylash: it goes down because your tech lost credit thats why they say never cancel credit cards
[1:49:45] SiriusSkold: I think US is very different Im European
[1:49:52] interdimensionalDave: The borrower is always slave to the lender. That is why debt is bad.
[1:50:06] EddyStylez: I never understood why anyone would spend more than they have, felt like a scam/trap i was always too scared to do it lol
[1:50:16] gutzwow: the fastest way to increase your score is to have larger amount of credit, aka how much people will give yoy
[1:50:34] gutzwow: increase your credit card limits and your score goes up alot
[1:50:36] Goofaloofus: Use the CC for small things and pay it off it will hep with credit score
[1:50:41] Lotsovkhaos: Using credit builds your credit. It's not just the credit score, it's the history of yoru accounts. if you're constantly using and paying off credit that affects you postively much more than just not using it

[1:51:04] gutzwow: the more money people are willing to give you, the more your credit goes up. its a fact
[1:51:19] SiriusSkold: Im thinkin about gettin back to WoW after many years. Worth it guys??
[1:51:35] Sinycc: If you don't have your own personal credit history, ask a parent to add you to one of theirs as an authorized user. It will then count towards your account history and length of credit and average age.
[1:51:38] SiriusSkold: Dont tell my credit LUL Kappa
[1:51:43] SynistorTV: credit utilization is a thing as well. on average around 30% utilization is the best for your score.
[1:51:51] gutzwow: if you have say 200k limit card, you will have 830 credit score
[1:51:59] ghettotrampstamp: if I can't pay cash for it I don't need it. I bought my house cash. buy my cars cash.
[1:52:36] padroby: Swifty since your such a iconic WoW legend, in your opinion when is Wrath Classic coming out?
[1:52:47] draitheo: Lost Ark is the next New World
[1:52:49] madmax84: lol, in sweden it is like this, more loans and credits you have, more fukked you are xD
[1:53:08] Prov1eh: swifty bro whats popping
[1:53:19] tdog23cm: What are the strongest pvp classes in your opinon?
[1:53:24] Sinycc: @FatMatt1982 Rewards/Travel cards is a fun game to play if you can pay off each month, or multiple times per month. Obviously cant buy a house with a CC. But for everything else, get a travel card and use those points. You were gonna spend the "cash" anyways.
[1:53:43] attilalfde: GlitchCat

[1:57:47] padroby: what do your totems do in SoM
[1:57:55] fizrukh: @Swifty are you gonna play lost ark ?
[1:57:56] attilalfde: with professions i think warlock^^ in 1v1 :)
[1:57:59] Armenierr: are you enjoying ur shaman pvp more than ur r14 warrior?
[1:58:02] Fressk: whats the biggest diff betwen SoM WOW v Classic WOW
[1:58:04] ghettotrampstamp: @sinycc having that card will give me the impulse to buy something I may not be able to afford at the moment. my job is sporadic and is very feast or famine. I may work 7 days 12 hours for 2 months, then I may be off for a week or a month or more. then I may only work a day or 2 every week for 3 months. it's been very good since July, but it won't stay that way and if I'm in debt it's a bill I won't be able to afford
[1:58:27] xsanteria: I mean yea, there so annoying to fight as a hunter. Probably some of the tankiest guys ever lol
[1:58:27] SynistorTV: @Swifty having all the game knowledge you do now, if you could go back to the start of wow release, would you still main a warrior?
[1:58:28] attilalfde: but i don't play Classic 1v1 PvP bcause there is no way for fun and fair 1v1 PvP in WOW^^
[1:59:14] attilalfde: :)

[2:02:42] poope05: HEllo swifty and friends
[2:02:43] SynistorTV: shamans can purge palys, slow them ect.
[2:03:02] xsanteria: what 2h do u use?
[2:03:09] SiriusSkold: Everyone plays classic is shadowlands so bad??
[2:03:11] tdog23cm: And against sp?
[2:03:36] Boroborgeran: a paladin can just /cry vs shamans
[2:03:48] Meatchopper: Seal of Justice and a 1hander though .. pretty good - pala's stun a lot by using that
[2:03:59] Plasticman909: what about the spell blade?
[2:04:02] xsanteria: Ah for sure. No yea, I get your spec. I was just wonderin if you had some type of special 2h
[2:04:07] jensenpassingby: Hi Swifty <3 Just tuned in <3

[2:06:59] ykasonni87: hi
[2:07:08] gutzwow: yes 100%
[2:07:13] gutzwow: they will drain your mana
[2:07:14] madmax84: it would be fun if you test something new next time
[2:07:25] DaPessimist: shadow priest can 1v1 most classes
[2:07:29] Meatchopper: would you go for R14 again if they do another SoM?
[2:07:42] SynistorTV: you could still beat the priest. they only have the one real fear for CC and shaman can counter that easily. then its a dps race
[2:07:43] xsanteria: cant shaman just purge everything literally?
[2:07:56] 1111demon: @Swifty How is population on SoM these days? worse then before? i stopped playing after ranking to 12
[2:08:01] SynistorTV: exactly. even purge the spriest shield
[2:08:11] nemofisken: what expac did you have most fun in?
[2:08:13] xsanteria: as 30/0/21 ele/resto you can win dps race easily
[2:08:13] gutzwow: a good shadow priest won't use bubbles
[2:08:23] DaPessimist: if Shaman can stay in melee range they win
[2:08:24] gutzwow: just heal themselves and drain your mana with dot ticking
[2:08:30] DaPessimist: especially with gear like Swifty
[2:08:40] SynistorTV: @gutzwow they have nothing to counter a shaman. shaman literally counters everything they have.
[2:08:42] trayshcanxd: grounding destroys shadow priests in classic
[2:08:53] gutzwow: nah
[2:08:55] 1111demon: @Swifty You should play 21/0/40 or 20/0/41 that is wat i played in classic
[2:08:58] gutzwow: not true at all
[2:09:10] gutzwow: you can easily wand shamans totem and drain there mana
[2:09:16] madmax84: can you plz test play rogue next season
[2:09:16] gutzwow: its so easy
[2:09:27] gutzwow: I laugh at shamans
[2:09:27] tdog23cm: Would love to see some Duells swifty!
[2:09:39] gutzwow: u just wand grounding or rank 1 it, ez
[2:09:51] attilalfde: FamilyMan :)
[2:09:52] xsanteria: Oh for sure ele mastery is a must for wpvp stuff
[2:10:15] Boroborgeran: swiftyUZI
[2:10:15] SynistorTV: @gutzwow its very true. grounding/tremor to stop the fear. purge the shields/buffs and then wind fury them down. an enhance shaman doesnt rely heavily on mana. by the time you tank the hits spamming mana drain youre dead

[2:10:54] GlitchRekal: hey swifty
[2:11:01] Boroborgeran: word
[2:11:14] gutzwow: no a good priest won't use bubbles and renew, they will just dot and mana drain and wand totems
[2:11:22] gutzwow: its easy I do it to rank 14 shamans all the time
[2:11:37] Boroborgeran: troll
[2:11:38] gutzwow: then silence when shaman is 50% and burn
[2:11:39] silverballs: well just shock the mana drain

[2:12:17] Boroborgeran: a shaman priest would win
[2:12:19] 1111demon: @gutzwow i killed a SP during 2019-2021 classic he was full bis pvp gear and i was r13 without r14 weaps but i used lokamir + shield from vael still managed to winn but had to use nades and perfect timing
[2:12:20] officialquail: lets see it he seems confident
[2:12:29] silverballs: prot pvp was awesome watching you
[2:12:42] 1111demon: @Swifty you planning to play arena in WOTLK?
[2:12:51] tdog23cm: Can you do some Duell
[2:13:04] SynistorTV: @gutzwow you arent playing good shamans then. the shaman is going to be on you the entire time doing damage. when you try to cast youre gonna get spell locked by shock and pounded into the ground. you cant fear them off. silence does nothing against wind fury melee lol
[2:13:14] Boroborgeran: swifty sits inside a saloon. shadow priest guy comes in
[2:13:36] gutzwow: your clueless sinister
[2:13:46] gutzwow: you just kill tremors and fear them lol what

[2:14:17] Boroborgeran: cant they just put down anoyher tremor?
[2:14:27] monkatiwesz: how goes the one-shot extravaganza?
[2:14:32] gutzwow: not if silenced
[2:14:40] SynistorTV: @gutzwow ive played since vanilla. ive been around awhile. everything youre saying would work if the shaman was standing still letting you freely do whatever. but in the real world that doesnt happen
