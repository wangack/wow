[3:02:15] GalDIBan: put gloves on
[3:02:18] WilleySlippery: i hate greasy hands
[3:02:19] gdkpgold: it depends on the pizza, if its soggy and falling apart u need a fork and knive same like a big burger
[3:02:19] nailerak: much more fun to first show class, but then break it: cut pizza with fork & knife, then pick up the little pieces with your hand :D
[3:02:20] SAMO0RA1: yeah u can get a portion too its easier
[3:02:21] Polarmensch: your hands stays clean youre just a noob at eating d√∂ner

[3:03:08] peteschaff: depends on the style of pizza too. neopolitan and chicago are meant to be eaten with fork and knife. new york style and detroit style is by hand
[3:03:10] Polarmensch: like i said hes either a noob or the shop isnt good at making d√∂ner
