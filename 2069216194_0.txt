[3:01:36] Bebisita: imagine going on a first date with a guy, and they start eating doner with a fork, RUNNNNNNNNNN
[3:01:39] WilleySlippery: ofc you eat pizza with cutleries in a restaurant and not be a fucking animal
[3:01:41] Istunlocklocalpensioners: sometimes a brother just wants to keep his hands clean
[3:01:46] Istunlocklocalpensioners: what can you say
[3:02:03] Polarmensch: BTW if the sauce makes a mess you just havnt been to a good döner shop yet
[3:02:03] Alfurias: typical rogue MegaSus
[3:02:10] zickiwow: which guys goes first date kebab, how old are u 14?
[3:02:15] GalDIBan: put gloves on
[3:02:18] WilleySlippery: i hate greasy hands
[3:02:19] gdkpgold: it depends on the pizza, if its soggy and falling apart u need a fork and knive same like a big burger
[3:02:19] nailerak: much more fun to first show class, but then break it: cut pizza with fork & knife, then pick up the little pieces with your hand :D
[3:02:20] SAMO0RA1: yeah u can get a portion too its easier
[3:02:21] Polarmensch: your hands stays clean youre just a noob at eating döner

[3:02:55] Polarmensch: @SAMO0RA1 or that
[3:03:08] peteschaff: depends on the style of pizza too. neopolitan and chicago are meant to be eaten with fork and knife. new york style and detroit style is by hand
[3:03:10] Polarmensch: like i said hes either a noob or the shop isnt good at making döner
[3:03:17] Bebisita: the cheesy bread looks bis, with a little bit of oregano
