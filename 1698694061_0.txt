[1:15:26] tf2444: I’m not real
[1:15:26] Migolicious: @shroud if you want to load in faster in raid you should invite a random so you make a group then start the raid it should load in faster

[1:15:53] Commute: Thats a good take
[1:15:55] MilliNation_: lean wit it rock wit it
[1:16:00] headhunterluis: sidestep is the quickpeekj
[1:16:00] realmason1: I just can't stand the netcode, I've never lost a fight when i push, vice versa holding an angle is instadeath
[1:16:06] Lams__: there is a bind for quick pick
[1:16:06] cthulhumangos: Shoulder swap + you need to choose if your character is right or left handed during character creation.. and your off-hand can't steady-aim
[1:16:07] Paradova: similar to rainbow 6 leaning?
[1:16:08] headhunterluis: im pretty sure you can sidestep fast
[1:16:08] deebohh: alt q peek is pretty quick compared to normal peeking
[1:16:08] Rubiales_topG: scav is bugged ur not going to enter
[1:16:08] WickedInstincts: Ya recoil is a little crazy
[1:16:09] tf2444: Lean should be faster?
[1:16:10] GRAVitized: There's a mechanic in game to side-step, if done correctly.....
[1:16:10] GonzDoom: @shroud The audio being not as consistent as before, is a big thing too that effects decisions.  I feel.
[1:16:11] Frizzbe: @shroud game doesnt miss tech , it misses Optimization and newwaaay better sound !

[1:17:31] xzTWINzx: @shroud they've already talked about it. they are unlikely to do this, because they will have to do as many more animations with weapons as they already had
[1:17:31] Markie_S: The queue time OMEGALUL
[1:17:32] Byometric: mirror allows vision but wouldn't change the fact you're stuck

[1:18:02] n0n4m3_001: in some situations when a guy has right peek and you have the left peek, he'll see your whole body while may see part of his right arm. That's how bad that left peek is.
[1:18:03] xMikeyG1024: fix what?
[1:18:03] IcarusVLRT: @shroud create a group, invite random player and press ready before they can join. It makes you get a game faster

[1:43:24] Darth_Gopher931: unless you give kernal accses cough cough... valorant
[1:43:25] Tarianx: how loud is your volume to hear people in this game
[1:43:26] NomadSage: 1 tap
[1:43:26] EazyLuciano: we need to create an AI that can detect hacks by itself and learning from previous cheats @shroud .
[1:43:27] NobleRacc: @shroud why would they honestly, they have to keep buying accounts non stop
[1:43:27] NomadSage: easy
[1:43:28] Jabald_: EZ
[1:43:29] xSCYTHE2x: cheaters can be fixed, but only irl you have to remove that want for them to cheat
[1:43:29] Teebees: FOLDED
[1:43:30] Ruinkind: Its impossible to stop hacking, in all senses of the word.  You can make it hard, and dump a shit load of money into it, about it.
[1:43:30] Dukenhime: yikes
[1:43:30] okiedokerson: EZ
[1:43:32] Videvik: Pog
[1:43:32] cyanwarrior5: Nice

[1:43:35] Mailliwi_: oof
[1:43:36] RhubarbCalavera: poor dude
[1:43:37] vac_approved13: @kukara420 always filled with cheaters
[1:43:37] Nippelz: @Dragoma Depends on how determined and full of cash the cheater is. There are ways to change that.
[1:43:38] clarqe: @Dragoma i think they only ip ban and it doesnt take a genius to change ip
[1:43:41] Yo_Taytay: i really dont understand how game devs that get paid 100s of thousands a year cant figure out how to detect cheating software
[1:43:42] panda_coot: nice shot
[1:43:43] KikouOG: Server side anti cheat would be nice
[1:43:51] Dukenhime: dude was having a good time and just got one tapped
[1:43:52] Yo_Taytay: cheaters smarter than devs i guess
[1:43:53] Xiphur: There will always be cheaters in games. There is actually nothing you can do haha
[1:43:55] 0xygenhomie: 100s of thousands KEKW
[1:43:56] SmoothieLord69: Kappa
[1:43:57] maxaldra: shroudNom
[1:44:01] OFFSAUCE: games need to force CVARS like they did in the day. Any discrepancy between the server file and the clients it kicks you from the server. @shroud
[1:44:04] Dragonwoops: @ruinkind better than letting hackers run wild
[1:44:04] jbobtwentysix___: @EazyLuciano Call Of Duty's Ricochet already does that (kinda?) it's machine learning
[1:44:06] n0n4m3_001: @Yo_Taytay say that to battle eye.
[1:44:10] Suprflyy: Devs getting paid 100s of thousands? KEKW

[1:44:20] shell_dwellers247: ghelawhawel
[1:44:25] justgethigh: do cheaters battle each other to see who has the supreme software?
[1:44:25] sahilwagle: play valo
[1:44:28] Yo_Taytay: okay not 100s of thousands individually lmaooo
[1:44:28] Gerrits_Channel: what kind of cheaters/cheats are in this game? :O
[1:44:29] BakinPacman: this spot is so sketchy LUL
[1:44:30] 0xygenhomie: damn i gotta work for BSG, 100's of thousands
[1:44:31] DirtyHoEBo: Imagine cheating
[1:44:31] maxaldra: @OFFSAUCE thats like quake and jedi outcast series
[1:44:34] maxaldra: worked great
[1:44:35] janzen3j: @Yo_Taytay because its not that easy.. most anti-cheats are server side, meaning the more checks that the anti cheat does the worse the game will run. kernel anti cheat would help a bit
[1:44:38] AJ_Doinks: yo chat what gun is that?
[1:44:39] Bustarapus: not even gonna loot him lol
[1:44:44] OFFSAUCE: @MaxAldra exactly
[1:44:44] Xiphur: @justgethigh at that point it comes down to who the smarter cheater is lmao
[1:44:45] Dragonwoops: @gerrits_channel wallhacks and aimbot
[1:44:46] n0n4m3_001: @justgethigh I heard they wiggle at eachother and avoid fighting against eacho ther
[1:44:48] xSCYTHE2x: @justgethigh there was a game that would put cheaters in a lobby
[1:44:48] thox1c_: sag-545

[1:44:51] Ruinkind: I agree.  @Dragonwoops  But its something not even a government with unlimited funds can stop.
[1:44:53] Gerrits_Channel: oh nu
[1:44:54] NomadSage: The only way to combat cheaters would be to set up an AI that watches EVERY match and catches a cheater and shadow bans them

[1:45:14] freedomkkona: monkaS
[1:45:14] valrash1981: See people through wall cheats, aim bot, flying and the like. Even teleportation.

[1:45:28] NomadSage: russian shroud is here monkaW

[1:46:00] dominations: what scope is this
[1:46:00] NomadSage: thats why you load up 2 mags and switch based on situation 5Head
[1:46:04] Ruinkind: Oh for sure, if you want to reduce the amount of farm cheaters and run carriers, you'd have to middle man that.  @Dragonwoops   You will never stop people from ego cheating with ESP/walls.

[1:50:51] NomadSage: @qdry_ literally 20 people answered that question just before you asked
[1:50:55] donnihue: WHAT red dot is that
[1:50:56] MurkedChicken: n0n4m3_001 kylew_tv NomadSage it gives you more FOV lol, and obviously is not intended.  Hence game breaking.
[1:50:59] blankybants: @KruxTV yea ik, but he just had it the normal way and instantly got it the "bugged" way

[1:51:18] NomadSage: @MurkedChicken and yet, it doesnt "break" the game, words have definitions for a reason LUL

[1:51:35] n0n4m3_001: @MurkedChicken i asked you about to prove how is that game breaking? What kind of advantage does it give to you besides a little more fov?
[1:51:36] Zadexz: @OFFSAUCE Keyword - advantage. This does not give you one. It is personal preference and should be an in-game setting. Most modern FPS games do, even older games like ARMA.
[1:51:37] coyotecasas: @glisteningfrank huh???
[1:51:38] kreeeees1111: @jonnytiv summit is a noob tbh

[1:53:17] ZenCaeWood: Wow his streets is so smooth
[1:53:20] MurkedChicken: n0n4m3_001 there is nothing to agree or disagree about.  It's not intended, therefore it gives an advantage.
[1:53:21] seatrinfps: northwest side
[1:53:22] snow_vvvvv: most comfortable keybiding  for leaning
[1:53:24] n0n4m3_001: @MurkedChicken for myself this bug doesn't give any advantage at all. but you believe what you want to believe.
[1:53:28] XHighHammerX: guys anybody know how he zooms in with  that scope?
[1:53:30] ZenCaeWood: @nofearhy prolly everything high LOL this dude has a 4090
[1:53:30] Mormont13: how do you change from horizontal to vertical an item in inventory?
[1:53:31] r0cky_fps: @ZenCaeWood fr i get like 30 fps
[1:53:33] Zadexz: @MurkedChicken Let's avoid the insults lol. Even games like COD and ARMA have this is a setting. It's not an advantage lol
[1:53:34] MockChozen1: @denmarkian saying something is ‘gamebreaking’ is pointless if the definition is different for everyone.

I was learning cause my grandparents are from Germany, but they both passed away in recent years so I have no one to practice with or speak German to. And that's the best way to practice a language, practical use in everyday scenarios.

[2:16:46] optimuspottery: The Cycle was phenomenal about a year ago, then they did a slight revamp and cheaters took over.
[2:16:48] tusky_tusky_: there's too many competing games, i think also. A new game will 100% leech players from other similar games.
