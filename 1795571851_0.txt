[0:33:36] stormwindchill: that's what she said
[0:34:00] Cathyndriel: Its a tale of two hearts Swifty - people will like the usability of the smartwatch, but like the feel of craftsmanship. Ultimately, the most expensive watches sold are still the mechanical ones. My brother in law sells high end juwelry, and they still sell watches over 1M euro's, that do little more then tell time.
[0:34:14] imNewBeetowow: gone glue my iphone12 to my arm, will almost look the same

[3:41:36] StreamElements: A moment of silence for Swifty's first HC character: https://twitter.com/SwiftyiRL/status/1634308885556109312 second one with @Vahri https://twitter.com/SwiftyiRL/status/1634403524984356864 Ursula https://twitter.com/SwiftyiRL/status/1635827608767086593 and Swift the warrior https://twitter.com/SwiftyiRL/status/1647713674751098880
[3:41:37] diarog: can't you take faster with moonfire?
[3:41:41] stormwindchill: call asmongold and he can get in touch with the owner of the server and obliterate this dude
[3:41:51] aussiebelle: That player is annoying
[3:41:51] Atp64: moonfire ftw
[3:41:57] taasty31: Yo swifty can you show you gaming room ?
[3:41:58] sheerheartattackyk: hc discord mods can't do nothing, blizzard even. If they launch hc servers maybe but now i doubt
[3:42:13] jedi_healer: @stormwindchill asmon suffers from the same issue. it's the streamer effect

[3:42:24] hiyoriwoot: No hc discord mods can. They can remove his staus as valid and his cahracter is dead in the communities eyes
[3:42:37] trumptight: Swifty watch out he’s gonna pull mobs and fd
[3:42:39] hiyoriwoot: for a level 21 that's a lot of hours wasted
[3:43:04] sheerheartattackyk: yeah but he can keep griefing lol, they can remove the status but not the character or account
[3:43:11] dasantie: did your warrior die?
[3:43:15] Rockon20000: there's no point in HC servers official since they won't implement anything close to what the hardcore addon does and i doubt they'd be around for appeals for griefing etc either.
[3:43:24] richdawg: Yes
[3:43:29] jedi_healer: what a loser, geez, i don't have mental fortitute to pull up with community like that
[3:43:31] mojokazama: But only 1 xp this hunter ist stupid
[3:43:36] sheerheartattackyk: i saw level 3 people dying on starting zones so yeah xD
[3:43:38] xichell: ive died in starting zones lots
[3:43:42] Blitz19: Can't die in the starting zone he says, yet so many do 1-5 heh
[3:43:55] trumptight: Sure, can if you got 4 or 5 on u and they fd
[3:44:01] diarog: way harder to grief if your character gets deleted if you die
[3:44:03] vincenzowl: hi Swifty what is your setup ?
[3:44:11] tomcruiseo07: !die
[3:44:12] Jarless: if the server was hc then their wouldnt be hardly any griefing
[3:44:14] omgitsjason: so weird people troll like this hunter lol like how much a douche are you
[3:44:31] TravisThee: Most of the people who grief aren't even doing HC
[3:44:37] Fight_Monkey: All you have to do to make a server hardcore is... pretend it is.... Just delete your character when you die
[3:44:45] Blitz19: Some people just want their 5mins in the "sun", shrug
[3:44:53] snuffles_80: this is probably the most exciting thing this hunter have done in years
[3:44:57] Kriptz01: But Hard Core is only a trend. It will go in 2-3 weeks when Season 2 comes out and new raid in WotKL classic
[3:45:12] mace2k2: That hunter must have a sad life if they get enjoyment out of this.
[3:45:13] sheerheartattackyk: they need attention, prob mom or dad never gave him a hug LUL
[3:45:17] richdawg: Loser hunter

[5:48:05] talikars: Just need to get to 10 and you're GUCCI with druid
[5:48:18] talikars: you don't have to, you can play with other non hardcore people at 60
[5:48:23] talikars: but most of the community would go again, yes.

[5:53:27] Dwightmare: I chose where i cant use Healing potions cause honestly i hate myself
[5:53:35] talikars: @realbonfire HC isn't like retail, you're not levelling to do endgame content. It's not a waste of time just to level. It's exactly that which is fun (if you find it fun). What I'm trying to say is the journey is the fun. Losing it and starting again doesn't feel as bad as you'd think
[5:53:42] Nicknjesh: why everytime you have new character swifty? did you just die on preview chars
[5:54:01] talikars: I'm time poor, taking my time to level my warlock and having a blast. It doesn't feel like a waste of time at all taking it slow
[5:54:05] PancakeOrc: the guy hopping is def a stalker
[5:54:28] talikars: Barrens
[5:54:30] Nicknjesh: oh I am so sorry xD
[5:54:44] obliteratoe: swifty wasnt so swift..... LUL
[5:54:45] KodiakJedi: Instead of deleting the character you should leave them in ghost form so when you log in you can see each of your old toons dead

[9:32:25] SilkeySmooth: they must be watching
[9:32:29] Seoken1: If you ask I’m sure they would approve it was intentional grief
[9:32:29] GloomzieHC: they let streamers apeal at lower levels cause of the griefing
[9:32:34] Chadskee: Rez you aren’t on death log
[9:32:36] Blitsburg: xaryu had same deal where he was griefed and was able to rez immediatly
[9:32:39] stormwindchill: teagans gave you bad directions and distracted you that's why
[9:32:42] stormwindchill: she said the lake

[9:34:27] murky_dirk: only level 7 would probably take less time to start over
[9:34:33] avenomxx: lvl 7 takes an hour
[9:34:34] jedimind_lbc: Instant almost
[9:34:34] Lexon7: @Swifty Someone died at 41 :O
[9:34:35] SilkeySmooth: people should be banned for griefing
[9:34:40] VitalxCognac: The addon can tell when you get griefed sometimes and allow you to rez without appealing
[9:34:41] fenxjnr: -Grief appeal is for any level and has to include conclusive proof of:  A vod (or a fully conclusive death screenshot) of:  1. an unavoidable and forced griefing situation on a PvE realm that has no realistic out, or a preventable caution measure to avoid the situation altogether, or   2. is executed by a known griefer with the sole intention of hunting down HC community.   Recommend a screenshot of your combat log showing "what happened to me," to show what got the killing blow. The mod
[9:34:44] stormwindchill: it'd be faster to start over from 1
[9:34:57] bricka_crick: you tryin the hardcore challenge?
[9:34:59] NZavier: @SilkeySmooth Cant ban people if they arent "hardcore"
[9:35:00] Miraclehc: nope, he can continue im sure
[9:35:01] Arudavi: its not about level, its about justice
[9:35:07] OGSceneBoy: They only care about streamers, I got griefed and had footage and they didnt do anything, so i have up HC
[9:35:13] n8_2k: if it takes an hour you can relevel faster than that
[9:35:14] OGSceneBoy: *gave
[9:35:18] Naavaro: This girl would be great if you're trying to fall asleep
[9:35:30] Aruze2014: @Swifty  @Teagens  just continue without waiting, they will approve it, no reason to sit on ur hands for an hour if u know the outcome just keep playing.
[9:35:37] Teagens: @Naavaro I do ASMR for people who have trouble sleeping so yes =)
[9:35:47] Jdaniiels: why  not go to new server ?
[9:35:48] sevundra: Literally the reason I have no interest in HC. Such a waste of time
[9:35:49] n8_2k: HC sailors
[9:35:50] frosty78: HC sailors
[9:35:50] Naavaro: Brilliant. I'm half way there
[9:35:54] m0ntauk: SAILORS BABY

[9:36:55] m33chmo: Killed by: Black Dragonspawn
[9:36:55] frosty78: indicate that they tried twice and clip their first attempt
[9:37:18] Seoken1: ok yeah so I read the rules, and he will def get approved. Its only dc's/glitches/bugs that require you to be over 15. Griefing can be requested at any level
[9:37:25] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[9:37:30] Cassette_Kid86: @Teagens appeals require being atleast level 15

[9:39:13] Leftythewarlock: @Cassette_Kid86 appeals from griefs are approved regardless
