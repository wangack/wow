[2:08:52] Telomir: @FlNIKY Nah - goal of MDI is SPEED - given rogues, kit, they're the theoretical and practical quickest dps classes to get through the tournament. The "nerfs" will force the meta to go 1 WW & 2 rogues instead of 3x ROGUE. Unless other class kits and/or dungeon design is changed, rogues will dominate DPS slots for MDI.

[2:52:28] Nyctereutes: why just not run 5x rogues and and swap aggro every riposte? Keepo
[2:52:28] AirAerenor: @PrutsendePrutser I think the argument is that when three rogues are your answer to every affix, just about, there's a class imbalance. Plus, it isn't as fun to watch lol
