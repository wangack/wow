[0:13:17] churchren: OkaygeBusiness
[0:13:32] O_ren_ishii_o: this game looks so bad :0
[0:13:47] IcyFlamingo: his graphics look turned down to be fair
[0:13:59] DouNaiFFXIV: for a card tho
[0:14:07] churchren: hey arthars, has anyone ever tried to build a one-stop shop website for recruiting/finding statics for ff14?
[0:14:21] WanderingWarden: you dont play wow for its looks LUL
[0:14:24] crowback: To be fair though you are playing on low settings.
[0:14:34] O_ren_ishii_o: it is fun ?
[0:14:38] del_Forte: i dont mind the artstyle tho, its pretty timeless
[0:14:41] teedaasuu: 2010 Smadge
[0:14:52] KDFox417: arthars aint no movement kid at this point in his life Backseating
[0:14:53] O_ren_ishii_o: even ragnarok looks better
[0:15:13] grouptherapyyy: like lost ark
[0:15:21] kyrianardathtoth: Imagine if BDO has the same gameplay has ESO
[0:15:31] suicidalbread85: We came from the Bit wars
[0:15:49] kyrianardathtoth: WoW graphics age very well
[0:15:59] MaDJaM13: 1997, the release date of FFVII, a nice year to start playing video game.
[0:16:14] WanderingWarden: ive tried to do wow but i just feel so out of it i cant stay vested into it.
[0:16:31] churchren: i just don't trust blizzard anymore
[0:16:43] KDFox417: trust is gaming devs is cringe
[0:16:48] MaDJaM13: I tried both FFXI and WoW in 2004.
[0:16:49] just_a_casual_player: Subject to this BUTTS
[0:16:52] KDFox417: just complain about them on x instead xffing
[0:16:53] SongbirdYuki: Id love a mythic plus thingie in ff14 ngl
[0:17:01] del_Forte: i tried playing classic but that shit is so boring, its like the game actively tries to waste your time, so mufch downtime one everything
[0:17:10] O_ren_ishii_o: There’s healers on these too? idk for me FF was at his best on Storm blood, even the 24 man was sooo good
[0:17:14] MaDJaM13: I ended up choosing FFXI. No regrests.
[0:17:41] MaDJaM13: WoW is not a game for me and will never be.
[0:17:45] KDFox417: but bad graphics can def give some people motion sickness xffing
[0:18:06] straifulove: How's BM hunter feels this patch?
[0:18:06] asmodai4823: Bedge
[0:18:12] O_ren_ishii_o: everything needs a balance xD
[0:18:16] churchren: i played wow for 15 years, so i've been through the really good and bad times both in the game
[0:18:33] MaDJaM13: WoW has bad graphics right, even back in 2004, I could tell.
[0:18:35] churchren: i just can't trust blizzard to deliver anything consistent anymore or respect players
[0:19:22] MaDJaM13: Yeah +1 to that
[0:19:49] O_ren_ishii_o: I heard that the raiding scene is pay to win kinda on wow xD
[0:19:53] KDFox417: only need to be better than your last effort xffing
[0:19:58] churchren: yehhhh shadowlands was really really bad
[0:20:04] churchren: i quit in shadowlands
[0:20:21] IcyFlamingo: Shadowlands was lit besides the drought people just bandwagon the hate train
[0:20:34] Moosetradamus: do you hope for criterions become more like M+?
[0:20:51] KDFox417: yeah but whats xeno's opinion on wow xffing
[0:20:54] MaDJaM13: I quit WoW in 2004 after 1 month sub.
[0:21:06] plshelpxd: ion hazzikostas said in an interview with Preach that they working on 3 Expansion at the same time
[0:21:08] MaDJaM13: Best decision ever
[0:21:24] del_Forte: i dont think your wrong
[0:21:32] churchren: i mean, making the decision to play or not play the game based on graphics in a 20 year old MMO.... kind of dumb
[0:21:41] plshelpxd: thats why its legions falt that bfa was shit
[0:22:04] kurotsuchii_: breath on pull Deadge
[0:22:23] DocThuggly: they mentioned they would be full expansions, it's just a trilogy story wise
[0:22:36] O_ren_ishii_o: there’s a trial for that game ?
[0:22:40] plshelpxd: i'm done for good with blizzard, got my accounts deleted yesterday ^^
[0:22:41] MaDJaM13: @churchren Never said graphics was the only reason. lol
[0:23:03] O_ren_ishii_o: I loved 7 remake
[0:23:08] aBadOtter: do you think they should keep the formula now ? 3 raids and a fated season? or just do 3 seasons and next xpac?
[0:23:14] churchren: @plshelpxd bro don't trust blizzard's word for anything. preach already said that blizzard has no money in the faith bank with their fan base
[0:23:15] SongbirdYuki: @plshelpxd GIGACHAD
[0:23:54] suicidalbread85: Im excited for the new Mana game
[0:24:00] fNandow: @plshelpxd xffing i hope you don't regret your decision
[0:24:22] FrodeGamingTV: 98k evo KEKW
[0:24:33] MaDJaM13: FFXIV is the remake of FFXI. FFVII has a remake. WoW doesn't have a remake and never will.  Blizzard mindset isn't focus on quality, but on money.
[0:24:34] del_Forte: im still wiling to give retail a shot, just to be able to talk about it
[0:24:56] O_ren_ishii_o: lmao
[0:25:19] O_ren_ishii_o: I didn’t finish 16 yet
[0:25:46] O_ren_ishii_o: but se makes good games. I wish they fixed 13 on steam xD
[0:25:48] ZeroDivide1: i personally didn't mind 16.. the sidequests weren't great. but i enjoyed the game for what it was
[0:26:02] KDFox417: FUCK RAZER
[0:26:12] AioaVerona: My only gripe about WoW is that story seems End game focus as opposed to story
[0:26:14] LyzanderPlays: I agree
[0:26:15] O_ren_ishii_o: RAZER PRODUCTS SUCKS
[0:26:22] O_ren_ishii_o: it breaks so easy
[0:26:23] fNandow: xffing yoship can be involved in ffxvii. 8.0 will be another endwalker
[0:26:26] O_ren_ishii_o: trueeeee
[0:26:39] IcyFlamingo: inb4 razer sponsor
[0:26:42] churchren: weird, cause that was my experience going to corsair
[0:26:44] lirly__: razer shit peripherals anyway, LOGITECH all the way
[0:26:55] MaDJaM13: I'm glad I didn't sub on a Blizzard product. Blizzard would  have take my money and I would have got quality. Not subbing to WoW best decision ever.
[0:26:57] LyzanderPlays: My razer Naga Pro V1, the contacts on the side buttons are acting up already
[0:26:58] KDFox417: never gone wrong with steelseries nise
[0:26:59] O_ren_ishii_o: I’m not even jk, I bought a head set and it broken in 3 months
[0:27:12] churchren: my MMO corsair mouses broke in 6 months
[0:27:13] WanderingWarden: im still pissed logitech cancelled the g600 D:
[0:27:29] RootKiT_: i buy a new naga every ff14 expansion^^
[0:27:43] churchren: i bought 3 of the corsair MMO mouses, all 3 broke in 6months-1year
[0:27:46] del_Forte: i think corsair is pretty nice
[0:27:51] kyrianardathtoth: I have a blackwido keyboard :(
[0:27:51] LyzanderPlays: logitech mmo mouse when?
[0:27:56] TheFabilolz: So, what brand do you recommand then ?
[0:27:57] hikkipenya: Logitech mouse lasted me 6 years of FF
[0:28:04] O_ren_ishii_o: I bought 2 times the same headset. after the 2nd never. razer is garbo asfk
[0:28:05] ruffypuffybuffyduffy: I am curious if anyone here uses Wooting keyboard for MMO.
[0:28:06] ZeroDivide1: Huntsman Elite here.. and yup, I've had to replace it twice now. But i can't stop going back. Sadge
[0:28:09] GaiaLeones: my bought my mmo mouse for 25$ and still works just fine after 2 years lol
[0:28:10] Victom123: i really like their deathadder mouse
[0:28:13] O_ren_ishii_o: I really like steel series
[0:28:18] ThermiThorus: i'm so happy with my steelseries 6GV2 and Logitech G600
[0:28:19] ruffypuffybuffyduffy: hall sensor switches are intriguing
[0:28:28] shmeeplife: it almost feels like razer products are meant to break so you'll buy more to replace xffBusiness
[0:28:34] MaDJaM13: G600, I bought 2 in 10 years.
[0:28:39] tiberius776: I had a $20 steelseries mouse that lasted like 6 years
[0:28:44] straifulove: i haven't changed my mouse is 9 years
[0:28:44] SongbirdYuki: @shmeeplife this is a strat everyone uses almost KEKW
[0:28:50] Han_AbiXIV: Deadge
[0:28:53] Amoriar: KEKW
[0:28:57] MaDJaM13: I got was I need for my money.
[0:29:07] lirly__: logitech g502 has been the bet mouse so far for me, the g600 is too chonky
[0:29:52] LilyMinajXO: i like corsair scimitar cuz its affordable but the mouse wheel breaks all the time its a piece of shit :)
[0:29:58] O_ren_ishii_o: But for real, Arthas is 10000% right about razer lmao
[0:30:06] MaDJaM13: @straifu420 Are you casual?
[0:30:13] SongbirdYuki: @LilyMinajXO i have this one and is so true KEKL
[0:30:15] KDFox417: hes just waiting until ff18 xffing
[0:30:26] IcyFlamingo: Casuals are more likely to change their mice tbh
[0:30:27] Victom123: ff16-2 incoming lmao
[0:30:29] KDFox417: hes gonna recharge and go again xffing
[0:30:35] LilyMinajXO: @LilyMinajXO its such a good mouse but my god can they make a fkin metal wheel or something LMAO

[0:31:54] StreamStickers: Get in on the action by slapping a Stream Sticker! Type !stickers to learn how.
[0:32:04] Baleeted: a lot of people keep saying that 16 made the series into an action game but didn't play 15 on release....
[0:32:12] LilyMinajXO: arthars did you ever try Tarkov?
[0:32:14] cjinrem: yes i like to have party member
[0:32:19] KDFox417: was off the train and didnt even bother with lightning returns xffing
[0:32:19] fNandow: the characters in 13 are ResidentSleeper
[0:32:20] fordytheonly: Ff16 is not RPG which is bad
[0:32:32] ThermiThorus: LR was pretty fun mechanics-wise but what a shitty story
[0:32:35] O_ren_ishii_o: the combat from 13-3 is nice
[0:32:36] cjinrem: love the anticipation who is the next member
[0:32:39] ruffypuffybuffyduffy: back to the topic of mice and keyboards breaking why not play controller?
[0:33:14] asmodai4823: controller xdd
[0:33:16] AstazelNova: Idk I really dont think 16 was as bad as some people are making it sound lmao
[0:33:18] Victom123: @ruffypuffybuffyduffy because mouse and keyboard for most games are 10x better
[0:33:21] MaDJaM13: LOL!!!!
[0:33:23] SongbirdYuki: just play more xffing
[0:33:24] AstazelNova: My biggest gripe was the lack of rpg elements
[0:33:33] Quantum_extreme: ff16 is shit
[0:33:36] KDFox417: EAT ENOUGH SHIT AND YOU BECOME NUMB TO THE EXPERIENCE xffing
[0:33:42] ruffypuffybuffyduffy: how can ANY builderspender job be good in DSR? In pf? without padding bosses?
[0:33:46] asmodai4823: unholy is good xdd
[0:33:53] ruffypuffybuffyduffy: @Victom123 debatable
[0:34:08] O_ren_ishii_o: I’m just not a big fan of the combat and hmm the fetch quests
[0:34:14] SongbirdYuki: imo ff16 is kinda meh, but enjoyed the music cutscenes a lot Shruge
[0:34:22] asmodai4823: yea unlucky
[0:34:30] asmodai4823: i just made mine 2 days ago
[0:34:39] Victom123: @ruffypuffybuffyduffy debatable as so far which games we include. souls likes, racing games, thats where i say controller is nice
[0:34:41] LilyMinajXO: 16 is great for what it is, i just think it isnt the style of FF game most oldschool fans want lol
[0:35:05] SongbirdYuki: @LilyMinajXO exactly, if u look at it as its own IP is good
[0:35:19] bnomnomnomat: xffing
[0:35:24] ruffypuffybuffyduffy: @Victom123 FFXIV controller support is surprisingly good. been playing for a yer with a good roller. not a single problem.
[0:35:26] fNandow: persona is the new final fantasy xffing
[0:35:35] O_ren_ishii_o: I don’t think 16 is bad, it’s actually nice to play
[0:35:44] SongbirdYuki: where servers Madge i wanna see my femra
[0:35:53] LilyMinajXO: yeah, it just barely missed the mark. more RPG/game elements, less movie type feel, and probably a party system, even though NPCs are dumb as hell and probably would be annoying in that combat system lol
[0:35:54] AstazelNova: I personally just hated that stats felt meaningless for a game marketed as an rpg game
[0:36:14] ruffypuffybuffyduffy: @SongbirdYuki just google bycicle pictures man
[0:36:18] stagnantt: @SongbirdYuki apparently 30 more mins according to the site
[0:36:23] Baleeted: Square need to make an actual turn-based FF and see how it sells
[0:36:30] SongbirdYuki: @ruffypuffybuffyduffy LMAAAO
[0:36:36] Baleeted: so many people complaining about the lack of turn-based and won't buy it
[0:36:51] Victom123: @Arthars the production value is just too high to call it a spin off. i understand square enix in that sense
[0:36:55] SongbirdYuki: @stagnantt tyy peepoCute
[0:37:00] O_ren_ishii_o: Tell yoshi-p to add a new healer, give noct set back to ast and rework whm.
[0:37:16] SongbirdYuki: noct sect ast GIGACHAD
[0:37:27] LilyMinajXO: im just gonna have hopium that 16 was a prototype for the next FF MMO more than anything Copium
[0:37:32] O_ren_ishii_o: I need a new regen healer
[0:38:05] teedaasuu: Shruge
[0:38:08] SongbirdYuki: i only have it for NSFW ff14 Shruge
[0:38:10] Victom123: twitter lmao
[0:38:12] LilyMinajXO: @O_ren_ishii_o i wish they wouldve added Chemist, then gave noct to AST and let them stance between regen and shield healer
[0:38:12] MaDJaM13: I'm on X
[0:38:18] straifulove: im banned there Sadge
[0:38:45] TheFabilolz: Like any discussion about any ohter game
[0:39:01] Baleeted: "Omega was good BUT"
[0:39:04] xCGInferno: Spiderman 2 was like that to an extent
[0:39:05] MaDJaM13: Arthars has a good point on FFXIV not being about gameplay.
[0:39:21] bnomnomnomat: I like the gameplay, but the first playthrough is waytooeasy even in action mode.
[0:39:22] Victom123: going on twitter to go into an indepth discussion about anything is a lost cause
[0:39:25] TheFabilolz: I loved FF15

[0:39:44] SongbirdYuki: xff
[0:39:57] DEATHGOD15: 15 is shit
[0:40:04] Baleeted: I played XV on release, and really loved it until the Leviathan/Luna scene
[0:40:08] callum_hq: you can enjoy 15 and not think it's perfect
[0:40:08] teedaasuu: Aranea too

[0:47:32] fordytheonly: Wow is the only game that blizzard have left
[0:47:42] del_Forte: one thing they could take from wow is the cool item system, with cool effects, maybe talent tree, XIV feels so rigid in terms of builds and customization
[0:47:42] ZackEgoist: ff server up
[0:47:56] O_ren_ishii_o: @fnandow trueee! I can’t believe how Zelda looks so nice and Pokémon dogshit. they destroyed my Gen 4 remake

[2:00:26] junghee: If he's enh shaman they have severe button bloat, so I understand why he wants passive trinkets
[2:00:57] SetsYouFree: it being on use means if he doesnt use it he loses dps xdd
[2:01:41] grimelocked: +0,1% POGGERS
[2:02:15] awkswow: Simming is a little weird because it's still average dps. If there's a burst moment, those 3 minute trinkets are worth more than 0.8% efficacy anyways. Grats for you though for sure
