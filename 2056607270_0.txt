[3:18:54] Austyz: that 100% was way too fast
[3:18:56] Fludens: they came in once you had it
[3:18:56] mick_maus: if they can do that then lenny and them shouldnt be perma
[3:18:59] Galoots_: rule wise it shouldnt be it spawn camping the bank
[3:19:00] Sazaruna: i mean, its gonna be good RP once you win the case, imagine the downfall arc of cam once he cant do his capstone anymore
[3:19:00] harmooni: harmooni subscribed with Prime. 
[3:19:05] CinderrLight: danse danse danse
[3:19:08] Hustler__John: report it and find out lol
[3:19:10] HappysFunPalace: use RP to rob it back from him
[3:19:12] overheatedx: that shits worse than anything yall ever did
[3:19:13] bamboniiii: So are you finally disappointed with cannacasual or cam? @graycen
[3:19:16] oo7avenom: call officier cornwood
[3:19:20] songlokdong: that was too perfectly timed to not be planned
[3:19:22] Tony2362: oh yeah if lenny did that it would have been another ban
[3:19:22] Galoots_: its worse than robbing a house
[3:19:22] EvilCoatrack: adam: It's okay rule wise because there are roleplay solutions.  You could have called the cops.  You could have sued them.  You could have had a revenge arc.  All of those are roleplay opportunities.
[3:19:23] jasonnw10: He forced the money on U
[3:19:25] Radbugx: Nah Lenny wouldn't be such a dumbass
[3:19:27] 5L4Y3R: I'm gonna finally get in and hit lvl 26 then fall asleep KEKG
[3:19:28] BaddestCloud: how did the 3 even know to go to that specific bank to only rob you. to have masks and weapons at that specific time. seems weird
[3:19:29] cbusbb: @Graycen start a new gta team with fandy Lamonting
[3:19:29] eygton: they prolly woulda sued lenny irl
[3:19:42] Trodenskjold: Gray could still SLORPGLORPIN Cam if he got the chance
[3:19:52] HappysFunPalace: 100% they let him walk off so they cant argue its a bunch of randos
[3:19:55] Trodenskjold: would*
[3:20:06] oo7avenom: modern problems req modern solutions LUL
[3:20:14] Galoots_: thats same with the house though and lenny still banned
[3:20:17] 5L4Y3R: all I have to say is: fuck nopixel
[3:20:18] EvilCoatrack: I mean it's shitty but it makes sense a dumb crim would do that
[3:20:18] TouchingTurd: this game smells
[3:20:23] 5L4Y3R: they ruined your whole gang
[3:20:23] Fludens: yeah it’s cringe and lame. you should get your money back.
[3:20:24] aoe_enjoyer: perfect timing for rp to fall off
[3:20:26] oneALMONDMILKplease: oda
[3:20:30] overheatedx: u shoulda alt f4'd woulda been funny af
[3:20:30] BaddestCloud: people keep on saying “it’s just roleplay go with it” but most situations that means just letting people take advantage of you
[3:20:31] Blinkin: oda  󠀀
[3:20:33] 5L4Y3R: cam woulda been out weeks ago if Lenny wasn't banned
[3:20:35] HappysFunPalace: how would it work irl
[3:20:36] overheatedx: bannable but still
[3:20:40] songlokdong: cam's solution wasnt a RP solution SuckySnejpenDemontimeKachowMoonfangForsenW
[3:20:43] Fludens: they world gave cameras
[3:20:43] Radbugx: I mean it's his "new gang".  They do stuff for him
[3:20:44] bigbobs37: is that gta server only for streamers?
[3:20:48] cbusbb: @Graycen new gta squad with Fandy , then iron forge after with fandy and the blonde Lamonting
[3:20:54] HappysFunPalace: and bank security
[3:20:54] OrganikCum: i thought i remember summit saying something about it being against the server rules to rob at the bank
[3:20:57] oo7avenom: and police swat on standby IRL
[3:20:58] overheatedx: no cameras at a bank is trolling
[3:21:01] Galoots_: sitting outside bank is meta gaming
[3:21:02] jasonnw10: Report they'll have the bans and shit to deal with
[3:21:05] BaddestCloud: two people would be in their offices and they would wire the money like smart people
[3:21:08] oo7avenom: they dont hire fat bank guards anymoe LUL
[3:21:09] Sazaruna: if your crim shit wasnt whack, you could have had a gun at this point PEPW
[3:21:10] HappysFunPalace: i think robbing people inside a bank is meta itself
[3:21:10] grethedren: irl the bank has tellers and guards and they'll call the cops lol
[3:21:14] 5L4Y3R: @OrganikCum it is but they don't care because reddit won't ban them
[3:21:15] songlokdong: and banks have security
[3:21:19] 5L4Y3R: they're not infamous enough
[3:21:25] EvilCoatrack: yeah I don't think they do that in 4.0
[3:21:33] Hustler__John: lol
[3:21:39] BingoTingler: ang has zero chill
[3:21:45] 5L4Y3R: KISSALILBRO
[3:21:47] HappysFunPalace: bad guy
[3:21:48] Waaysus: who did you pay to RP as your girlfriend
[3:21:49] Galoots_: dont tell ang what to do ReallyMad
[3:21:49] Trodenskjold: PVP TAGGED
[3:21:50] oo7avenom: IRL bankss have a literal unmarked shed behind the gank with 2 swat officers
[3:21:53] Trodenskjold: KILL GRAYCEN
[3:22:01] eygton: so tempted to kill all of you rn
[3:22:09] 5L4Y3R: DOG

[3:22:42] snejpen: no thanks
[3:22:59] jasonnw10: Scam squad went down hill after Steven and Lenny got banned the same for them
[3:23:04] BingoTingler: !gamble 30%
[3:23:06] EvilCoatrack: I mean they clearly pre-planned it, it wasn't metagaming if they were looking for the signal
[3:23:10] OrganikCum: yea you could just camp the bank and rob everyone, it definitely isnt allowed
[3:23:19] EvilCoatrack: but yeah def should have been a wire transfer
[3:23:25] oo7avenom: it felt like one of those gta v missions LUL
[3:23:29] Sazaruna: I'd say it was set up, cam was out to meet people and set up a thing, chuck even notes how he was out there meeting people but ended up coming back alone? cam even made sure you dont try to fuck him up. I'd say gary, and you, are just gullible as fuck om
[3:23:37] Fludens: yeah I’m pissed and o don’t even play
[3:23:39] Galoots_: @EvilCoatrack its not about pre planning its bout camping where ppl have to withdraw and deposit
[3:23:56] Hustler__John: cam said he didnt know they were going to rob u
[3:23:58] Radbugx: Chuck was filming the whole thing
[3:23:58] songlokdong: @EvilCoatrack it wasnt RP though, "i dont want to do illegal things" *does illegal things*
[3:24:03] 5L4Y3R: lol
[3:24:05] Hustler__John: thats banable
[3:24:20] HappysFunPalace: @EvilCoatrack characters can lie wdym
[3:24:23] EvilCoatrack: @EvilCoatrack yeah but this wasn't camping - this was specfically looking to screw a specific person at an exact moment.
[3:24:25] 5L4Y3R: cum lies ooc
[3:24:29] noosekabob: suspected nothing to go wrong might as well be gullible
[3:24:31] 5L4Y3R: more than he breathes
[3:24:35] Sazaruna: ok, but have you considered that he thinks he can weezle his way out of the contract? the contract means jackshit if you cant back up the claims.
[3:24:38] kutebread: I'd camp you.
[3:24:43] kutebread: I'm going to camp you in SoD.
[3:24:51] Fludens: yeah they came in right when you had the money
[3:24:59] Trodenskjold: @kutebread Please do
[3:25:00] Galoots_: @EvilCoatrack thats still camping where u get money

[3:25:38] Fludens: also in reality banks don’t give cash out for those amounts
[3:25:42] Austyz: the lawyer literally said he would barely have to work for this case because it was so easy to prove lol
[3:25:46] MrMcbadger: FeelsGoodMan
[3:25:55] HappysFunPalace: did you specify that in the contract?
[3:25:56] Radbugx: He was upset you didn't take his deal and sold the house on market
[3:26:01] Galoots_: if theres no camera's in bank just say u didnt get money
[3:26:07] kutebread: Cam will give you $150k in monopoly money.
[3:26:14] 5L4Y3R: then why did you let him force cash in your pocket if you didnt consent to that
[3:26:18] jasonnw10: Go to the government
[3:26:19] MacSlackin: IRL you would need proof of payment right so cash is dumb
