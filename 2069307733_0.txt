[0:20:36] rayzerpls: its so good man
[0:21:12] shaycwe: not gonna lie, i never played cata or mop, but most people say mop is better but cata had more balanced pvp
[0:22:01] shaycwe: true yeah
[0:22:21] rayzerpls: every class i have played
[0:22:23] rayzerpls: is super fun
[0:22:29] rayzerpls: the class design is just nutty
[0:22:30] malyoyo: trying to balance was actually the downfall of pvp since now everyone has the same CDs..
[0:22:33] rayzerpls: every class feels complete
[0:22:40] mwako: which class is the best in mop
[0:22:41] rayzerpls: can do so much
[0:22:50] rayzerpls: @mwako in 2s or 3s
[0:23:26] braci91: do we Q on 2.6 mmr if you play with your left hand
[0:23:35] jamminlove: rdruids ofc
[0:23:38] brezkovtv: if they give all classes same spells is too boring
[0:23:51] rayzerpls: in 2v2 frostmage/restodru ww/restodru is clear best
[0:23:58] Tonzeh: i loved playing boomie i mop
[0:24:08] rayzerpls: boomy rog in 2s is crazy too

[0:27:57] jamminlove: mop was goat last season only
[0:28:14] jamminlove: but if they do mop classic we'll play last patch which is the only playable one all seasons, should be pretty good
[0:28:23] Crawfordlol: Magnetic align top right corner
[0:28:25] Crawfordlol: Uncheck
[0:28:26] braci91: gg we tried
[0:28:30] rayzerpls: @jamminlove nah
[0:28:42] rayzerpls: s15 patch with s12 gear will be more fun prob
[0:28:54] jamminlove: thats what I said
[0:29:00] rayzerpls: ah missread
[0:29:36] braci91: true
[0:29:42] braci91: ok thx
[0:29:45] rayzerpls: good thing is the meta changes so much in mop from s12 gear to s15
[0:29:46] Askesatan: Tja pojken! Do you run reflective shield on your disc priest for 2s?
[0:29:47] rayzerpls: so will be fresh
[0:29:50] rayzerpls: will be good for sure
[0:30:24] SGT_WeeTooLow: Do you like playing retail?
[0:30:26] robbanj91: play ur priest with shinta
[0:30:31] Askesatan: Thanks :) Gonna play priest/hunter actually
[0:31:10] SGT_WeeTooLow: What is the biggest thing you dislike about retail?
[0:31:17] jamminlove: Pojke just really really likes the warmane degens he missed them
[0:31:50] jamminlove: make the command
[0:32:07] Stenlolz: are there any matchups where priest/war is better than par/war?
[0:32:11] Stenlolz: pal*
[0:32:16] jamminlove: positioning doesnt matte
[0:32:18] Ninemmglock: 0 outplay potential, nothing matters
[0:32:30] CropsFarm: You mean a lot of Turaxys?
[0:32:44] 4_0_4UserNotFound: whats the name of this font you are using ?
[0:32:48] CropsFarm: Shadow Priest healing like Discs?
[0:33:07] jamminlove: ricardo probably asleep still

[0:34:25] francis19933: Are u ok
[0:34:32] SGT_WeeTooLow: Still true, back in the day you 100% needed a healer in 2s or 3s. These days in retail you can easily survive as a DPS since you have insane heals.. The leechs on warrs and DH is insane

[0:36:44] jamminlove: yesterday there were like 5 different
[0:36:45] CropsFarm: @sgt_weetoolow I look at SPR play in Wrath and it's insane how long they can live
[0:36:54] jamminlove: But yea the top of the ladder is always lonely even if wow had 1 million arena teams
[0:37:10] bobrik21: sod happened mb?)

[1:05:16] notmorbos: @Oldgeezerx slowly decaying, as you can see r1/glad mmr is dead at this hour. but evenings you can spam queue any mmr
[1:06:08] Brooxz: i mean they even have managers for player comfort and coaching them for this.
[1:06:10] notmorbos: I DID
[1:06:10] mwako: these are retail que times
[1:06:10] skylightxo: @Minpojke league or wow pvp whats harder
[1:06:18] Brooxz: i cant see blizzard doing that in a million years
[1:06:31] Oldgeezerx: @notmorbos hmm and will Cataclysm PVP more active maybe?
[1:06:44] notmorbos: @Oldgeezerx initially yes, but itll share the same fate
[1:06:49] d3vil_kry: hi
[1:06:55] Oldgeezerx: i thought about playing Cata PVP u think it will ge active?
[1:07:12] froooo: sports psychologist?
[1:07:31] mwako: when is riot mmo out
[1:07:52] j4fmate: you ever touched Starcraft?
[1:07:53] pinatairl: hello senior
[1:08:12] toboYex: right now WoW is split in like hardcore, SoD, retail, classic wrath, couple pservers - which also does not help sadly
[1:08:30] Oldgeezerx: @notmorbos i dont like the Retail pvp anymore i kinda hoped for more positive answer :(
[1:09:14] ekunx: soon
[1:09:21] toboYex: yeah solo self found should be in soon i guess
[1:09:45] ekunx: hardcore's been on-and-off a couple of times
[1:10:13] loljaipris: retail must be so dead it’s cringe
[1:10:14] toboYex: just has its small community forever
[1:10:20] ekunx: used to be really popular in SOM, then it died out, then it got popular again during era, died again, then official servers came around
[1:10:30] ekunx: I can see it getting another renaissance with the self-found mode
[1:10:58] loljaipris: not even a real ssf.. even that they can’t do it properly

[1:11:30] ekunx: @loljaipris they don't label it as SSF, so what's the problem
[1:11:56] Oldgeezerx: @notmorbos but if u say glad ratings are kinda dead then idk if i should play
[1:12:17] Oldgeezerx: @notmorbos must be super hard then if queues are so long

[1:31:15] Shukanleljk: @Zorkwins pala/war
[1:31:26] skylightxo: @Minpojke Dont you kinda contribute to making WoW PvP dead by playing classic and making retail obsolete, and playerbase split ?
[1:31:32] kronyxius: good.  love seeing ferals lose lol
[1:31:47] jfkbmx69: is 10 years a lot
[1:31:53] ekunx: @skylightxo no?
[1:32:08] kronyxius: i think he means on wrath specifically @jfkbmx69
[1:32:09] Todd686: wild take @skylightxo
[1:32:19] shozgodx: are u on dialup pojke

[1:32:25] copemac: Rogue any good for cata tho?
[1:32:29] shozgodx: i thought that phased out 20 years ago lmao
[1:33:05] ekunx: but retail is the ONLY game for competitive pvp!!!!!!!
[1:33:12] jamminlove: Its not up to the player to play a worse version for the sake of that game, its up to the developers to fix it so people prefer one over the other
[1:33:18] jamminlove: wild take I know
[1:33:37] jfkbmx69: caringe
[1:33:38] j4fmate: @ekunx you missed raiku yesterday stating the exact opposite
[1:33:40] GarrinchA: retail is a shitfest
[1:33:51] skylightxo: @ekunx It is. Why would a company focus on PvP of an outdated version
[1:34:03] ekunx: @j4fmate you missed the sarcasm
[1:34:07] j4fmate: mbmb
[1:34:16] jamminlove: @skylightxo they can just fix the pvp of the updated version
[1:34:33] ekunx: @skylightxo because they actively chose to republish it???
[1:34:35] skylightxo: @jamminlove ACTUALLY, developers only focus on where profit is, so if people play Classic/SoD/other shit then obviously developers have NO reason to make PvP competitive, since people play random ass shit anyway
[1:34:48] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream and the content? Consider supporting by Subscribing or Donating! This is what I do full-time and any amount is greatly appreciated but not expected. Subscribers also don't receive any ads!
[1:35:07] skylightxo: Why do you think there is more PvP balancing on SoD than retail? Because all you classic players put your money there :D
[1:35:21] jamminlove: KEKW so I guess for 7 years when there was only retail, the pvp was still garbage with a few exceptions becauseee
[1:35:21] Moobot: playlist !socialmedias !photosynthesis !covenant !legendaries !conduits !stats !discord !macros !ui !specs !restodruid !awc !armory
[1:35:22] jfkbmx69: well, at least some answers are easy.
[1:35:52] GarrinchA: @skylightxo sod pvp event is the best that happened to wow for some time now kekw
[1:36:06] ekunx: @j4fmate 👍
[1:36:09] Todd686: woah, dont bring logic into this KEKW  @jamminlove
[1:36:10] jamminlove: Dont get it backwards, people are playing arenas specifically on classic because the retail version of arenas has been awful for a long time (with exceptions)
[1:36:10] ekunx: all good
[1:36:16] skylightxo: @jamminlove Sure, because people let Blizz know they give them money regardless. If you want change, SHOW it rather than play Classic versions or shit. Protest by actually boycotting the game
[1:36:17] jamminlove: If you want arena players back on retail, fix arenas on retail
[1:36:28] jamminlove: Im talking specifically about arenas, it's very different otherwise
[1:36:31] ekunx: DO IT @notmorbos
[1:36:38] jfkbmx69: @jamminlove wrong drude
[1:36:55] Avarishd: AYAYA
[1:37:00] skylightxo: @jamminlove Wow arena on classic seems so fun, look at all the viable specs and comps! ROFL /sarcasm
[1:37:24] kronyxius: more mongo SMOrc
[1:37:27] Turaxyy: HAHA
[1:37:28] jamminlove: LMAO
[1:37:29] jfkbmx69: jammin with the random guess hoping it hits fuck off dude
[1:37:29] ekunx: alkXD
[1:37:33] ekunx: alkXD alkXD alkXD
[1:37:35] cess1988: this fucking dude, why does he play this game
[1:37:39] GarrinchA: tilkt
[1:38:02] Turaxyy: u heard that @jamminlove
[1:38:02] kronyxius: is shinta career wrath player?
[1:38:10] jamminlove: ye
[1:39:06] skylightxo: Guys I decided - i'm gonna show Blizz how much I hate what they do to Arena by playing SoD! Now they will only get my money when I play SoD and not retail. THAT will show them!!!
[1:39:35] ekunx: @skylightxo who does that
[1:39:39] asthenos1: Odge
[1:39:55] jamminlove: People play sod because they prefer sod to retail, people play classic because they prefer classic to retail and sod
[1:39:57] jamminlove: It's that simple
[1:40:01] skylightxo: @ekunx Me. No better way to protest to Blizz than by still giving them money whilst playing old ass versions of WoW!
[1:40:18] jamminlove: Want people to stay in 1 expansion, make 1 better than the others, it's not hard
[1:40:20] ekunx: you and who else?
[1:40:28] maxtorman123: i usually tend to play exactly what i want to
[1:40:39] jamminlove: Weird take @maxtorman123 you should play something you hate to protest
[1:40:39] ekunx: https://7tv.app/emotes/6063d9f8f4dc10001426b946
[1:40:41] ekunx: need this for shinta
[1:40:43] ekunx: alkXD
[1:40:49] skylightxo: @jamminlove Yeah I'm sure they will make Retail good when nobody is happy with it no matter what Blizz does :D
[1:41:01] jamminlove: @skylightxo Thats up to blizzard, not up to the players.
[1:41:04] jamminlove: Players will play
[1:41:04] maxtorman123: youre right, i better play chess from now on (but still pay my wow sub)
[1:41:18] skylightxo: @jamminlove There's a culture of shitting on retail no matter how good it is, be honest
[1:41:18] Turaxyy: @jamminlove that's deep
[1:41:21] reggieface420: @skylightxo this is the way of wow, rarely the community is happy
[1:41:21] Moobot: www.Twitter.com/Minpojke_ & https://www.instagram.com/jonandersson92/ and https://discord.gg/STTWtwwDet
[1:41:22] Flodimo: just make it good, its that easy, just stuff all the goodness in there and its gonna be good
[1:41:23] jamminlove: ty tura
[1:41:26] Turaxyy: @skylightxo no lol
[1:41:31] skylightxo: Like people shit on Retail Arena yet it is 10000x better than fucking Wrath
[1:41:36] Turaxyy: nop
[1:41:42] jamminlove: @skylightxo ??
[1:41:47] Turaxyy: u're gaslighting yourself if you think people are "brainwash" to say that
[1:41:48] jamminlove: Hot take
[1:41:50] maxtorman123: wtf
[1:41:53] yummucake: is he just storming on CD
[1:41:58] yummucake: or it was actually a good storm
[1:42:05] reggieface420: people will play whatever they want to play
[1:42:09] jamminlove: ^
[1:42:11] skylightxo: @jamminlove How is it hot take? Wrath arena is so slow, unbalanced, doesn't have soloq... ZzZ
[1:42:25] ekunx: wrath is so slow alkxD
[1:42:25] wackdpri: kekw
[1:42:26] Todd686: i think we're getting 1 guyd
[1:42:26] ekunx: alkXD
[1:42:32] wackdpri: Take notes guys
[1:42:42] jamminlove: What's your rating? Idc if you're 3.6k or 1500, just wondering where your POV comes from
[1:42:43] Turaxyy: First of all if you don't liek wrahth why are you here
[1:42:43] brownhammer112: just look at stats on retail bro, shit is dead @skylightxo
[1:42:50] maxtorman123: only thing that is unbalanced is that the strongest comp has shadowmourne as well, the rest is quite well balanced
[1:42:56] skylightxo: @brownhammer112 It's not, soloq is very active
[1:43:00] reggieface420: arena enjoyment is a subjective thing, if you like retail then play retail, but coming to a wrath stream to complain that wrath is splitting the retail arena scene is honking
[1:43:13] jamminlove: @skylightxo soloq at 2.6k+ mmr has 20min queues
[1:43:18] jamminlove: not even wrath pservers have it that bad
[1:43:28] skylightxo: @reggieface420 It IS. Why would a company improve Esports for Arena when people play other versions anyway? lol
[1:43:45] jamminlove: @jamminlove @skylightxo
[1:43:57] reggieface420: "our version of the game sucks and no one plays it, its the people playing what they enjoy that's really causing us problems"
[1:43:59] Foffel: wow esports SeemsGood
[1:44:02] brownhammer112: @skylightxo nice bro, I just sat a 45 minute q like every other soloq player lmao
[1:44:05] skylightxo: @jamminlove Those 20-30 min ques allow you to play 6 matches (rounds) of 15-20 min length, so in 40-45 minutes you play basically 6 matches. So it's the same as queing 6 matches in normal 3v3
[1:44:08] yummucake: dampening is a shit mechanic and you cant change anyones mind on this
[1:44:13] whiteboy_ent: @skylightxo but they dont improve it, thats why nobody plays it KEKW
[1:44:16] Turaxyy: ???
[1:44:21] Turaxyy: 15 min round ??
[1:44:24] drumcodigo: @skylightxo they never cared about esports dude
[1:44:35] skylightxo: @Turaxyy 15-20 min  session
[1:44:38] brownhammer112: @skylightxo bad math bro
[1:44:48] jamminlove: Even if that was true, which it isn't, long queues actually kills the game because very few people are open to sitting queue doing fuck all, they just log off a lot quicker if they werent spam queueing

[1:44:54] jamminlove: self-fulfilling prophecy
[1:45:04] DRATSTILLZ: don't AWC players win like 10k per tournament?
[1:45:06] jamminlove: This is also why league made games shorter etc
[1:45:07] brownhammer112: @skylightxo also ww dh rogue are not balanced at all
[1:45:22] skylightxo: @brownhammer112 Thanks to SoD and Wrath players
[1:45:34] Turaxyy: how come
[1:45:40] skylightxo: Last 10 balance patch notes were for fucking SoD ROFLMAO!
[1:45:40] whiteboy_ent: dont they have seperate teams for each expansion
[1:45:42] jamminlove: Again, what's your rating @skylightxo
[1:45:42] ekunx: leave us out of this Peepo
[1:45:49] reggieface420: if people aren't playing retail arenas its not the wrath players fault
[1:45:50] Turaxyy: wrath have legit receive
[1:45:52] skylightxo: @jamminlove 3.3k
[1:45:54] Turaxyy: 0 balance patch ever
[1:45:58] reggieface420: indeed
[1:45:58] jamminlove: Can you link your check-pvp
[1:46:00] Turaxyy: and just few fix bug
[1:46:04] skylightxo: @jamminlove No
[1:46:07] jamminlove: ok :)
[1:46:08] kronyxius: LOL
[1:46:11] reggieface420: wrath doesn't do balance changes
[1:46:13] ekunx: no.
[1:46:19] skylightxo: @whiteboy_ent No
[1:46:20] reggieface420: not in pvp anyway
[1:46:31] skylightxo: @whiteboy_ent They hardly have a team for retail
[1:46:40] jamminlove: @whiteboy_ent Stop talking out of your ass
[1:46:48] reggieface420: sod does them but that's a random classic+ game that has like 5 people working on it with no arenas existing
[1:46:54] drumcodigo: @skylightxo u're blaming it on players and not on the actual devs that make retail unenjoyable, if it was good people would def play it, but it isnt
[1:46:58] Zorkwins: @skylightxo If you think that... YOu haven't been paying attention to Dragonflight
[1:47:39] skylightxo: Developers don't have a say in anything. They get orders from people who know where the money is. The money is NOT in the main game (retail) anymore, so WoW esports is dying BECAUSE there's no money in it. Thanks to SoD/Hardcore/Vanilla/Wrath players.

[1:47:54] brownhammer112: @skylightxo df is least played retail expansion in PvP
[1:48:01] reggieface420: you think that if sod didn't exist all those players would play retail arena?? xDDDD
[1:48:05] reggieface420: XDDDDDD
[1:48:09] skylightxo: @brownhammer112 DF came out same time as Wrath :D
[1:48:10] Zorkwins: The money isn't in retail anymore? lmao clueless take
[1:48:15] skylightxo: @reggieface420 Yes
[1:48:19] ekunx: i didn't read anything of what was written above Peepo
[1:48:20] drumcodigo: @skylightxo u're talking like if wow esports was ever a thing

[1:48:33] Kissa_missa: norm pacani c circulya razdayut
[1:48:35] reggieface420: most of blizzard's focus is on retail, there's like 15 people who work on all classic expansions combined
[1:48:38] skylightxo: @drumcodigo Because nobody spoke with their wallet. They play the game no matter what. You wanna protest? Quit the game
[1:48:42] Turaxyy: or not "kill" but clearly imapct'd it

[1:49:16] reggieface420: @ekunx someone is being wrong on the internet, its our duty :)
[1:49:24] ekunx: o7
[1:49:33] Shukanleljk: is this a one and done snipe team?
[1:50:18] skylightxo: The best way to make WoW PvP a proper Esport is to make it profitable for Blizz. And you do that by a: playing retail, and b: quitting Blizz shit altogether in protest
[1:50:20] ekunx: it's the same
[1:50:27] ekunx: people not playing retail killign wow pvp
[1:50:32] kronyxius: classic vs retail arena and how much classic pulls from retail arena...
[1:50:33] ekunx: alkXD
[1:50:34] Todd686: skylight is one guying everyone KEKW
[1:50:40] reggieface420: skylight thinks that if sod, wrath, classic etc didnt exist then retail pvp would be flourishing but we are distracting blizzard from making a good game
[1:51:04] ekunx: dawg when sod, wrath and classic we were playing on private servers
[1:51:15] ekunx: werent around*
[1:51:21] flapperstv: True :(
[1:51:28] kronyxius: wow isn't a marketable esport.  it's too complex
[1:51:31] brownhammer112: here comes the “nah”
[1:51:49] loafoath: blizzard did the same thing to overwatch and thats a bigger game than this so if they did it to OW then wow is dead in the water
[1:52:09] reggieface420: wow is really hard to follow, i played wow for a long time but if i was to watch a retail tourney it would be very hard to follow
[1:52:10] ekunx: @kronyxius in depth yes but you can still understand the basics of what is happening as a viewer, even without experience
[1:52:14] skylightxo: Blizzard is looking at the behaviour of the players. They make changes based on the behaviour. When people called for Soloq, they added it.
[1:52:32] EnsameKrigare: 1500 NA rating in 3s is top 2k atm so i dont even think we got that many playing wotlk
[1:52:46] reggieface420: wow is only watched by other wow pvpers and there aren't many of them
[1:52:47] brownhammer112: @skylightxo yep only took 12 expansions, they pay really close attention
[1:53:01] reggieface420: a random person can't watch wow and have any clue
[1:53:06] reggieface420: its just a bad spectator game
[1:53:14] ekunx: sure they can
[1:53:16] loafoath: you gotta be honest, unless you pvp wow arena is boring to watch
[1:53:20] ekunx: just not an in-depth understanding

[1:53:43] skylightxo: @brownhammer112 MAYBE if people actually didnt play the game in protest it would help. But nono, remember in S4 BFA when you had to farm 2 hours daily to be competititve in Arena? Yeah people still did that :D Don't blame Blizz for not rewarding a zombie playerbase who still pay them money no matter what lol
[1:53:50] brownhammer112: soloq was implemented by warmane legit years ago @skylightxo
[1:54:03] skylightxo: @brownhammer112 yes because people WANTED it otherwise they wouldnt play it
[1:54:16] brownhammer112: clueless
[1:54:20] skylightxo: Had the WoW community really protested to Blizz they would fucking listen
[1:54:26] heckler_and_koch416: whats the nameplate addon?
[1:54:42] kryzz93: Players WANTED it 12 years ago aswell @skylightxo

[1:54:48] kronyxius: @ekunx i disagree, you can't get into any depth by watching awc as a brand new viewer.  Not like you can with OW/COD/CSGO. During awc i get lost if im not paying attention, so i can't imagine what it would be like for someone with no experience trying to keep up
[1:54:51] skylightxo: @kryzz93 No they didnt
[1:54:59] ekunx: @kronyxius that's not what I said
[1:55:14] kronyxius: then you argued past what i said
[1:55:14] brownhammer112: @skylightxo yes they did
[1:55:19] ekunx: did I
[1:55:39] drumcodigo: @skylightxo they dont care about esports mate, u do realize that if their esport scene was bigger they would make shit ton of money right? So its not about money, they just dont want their game to be like that
[1:55:43] kryzz93: They did my friend ...they did @skylightxo
[1:56:15] brownhammer112: I’ve been protesting bro, you’ve been on retail this whole time and typing in wotlk stream for some reason. when are you gonna protest and quit? @skylightxo
[1:56:17] drumcodigo: @skylightxo blizzard is just bad at esports
[1:56:18] skylightxo: @drumcodigo That's clueless. Every company want money. They just don't care to change their business model because YOU GUYS PAY THEM GOOD MONEY ALREADY.
[1:56:34] skylightxo: @brownhammer112 I did. I didnt play many years sometimes in protest :D
[1:56:44] skylightxo: But they added soloq so I gotta reward them
[1:56:48] kronyxius: @ekun like try to keep up with Venn or Supatease when they get excited and think about not knowing any of the spells, classes, etc.. that's like impossible to keep up with.
[1:56:55] brownhammer112: so why are you here lmao @skylightxo
[1:57:03] ekunx: your argument is that the game is too complex to be marketable as a watchable e-sport, but you don't need to understand the complexities to watch arenas @kronyxius
[1:57:10] Xeriyo: russians slimey? no way
[1:57:16] skylightxo: @brownhammer112 Cus wrath arena is therapeutic. Relaxing and chill
[1:57:21] kronyxius: yeah but it's hard to enjoy something you don't understand like.. at all lol
[1:57:33] ekunx: the commentators also walk you through the simple and basic aspects
[1:57:39] Turaxyy: KEKW
[1:57:43] Turaxyy: @skylightxo HAHAHA
[1:57:50] notmorbos: yea man lets protest with our few thousand subs, surely theyre gonna care KEKW
[1:57:52] gekurt: this guy is so deep into his mental cage KEKW
[1:57:55] skylightxo: @Minpojke Blizz never wanted Classic or Soloshuffle. Yet they added both when people stopped paying them money. :)
[1:58:22] ekunx: you can still understand some of arenas even if you've never had any experience with it before as a viewer. you're saying people wouldn't understand anything "at all", which isn't true
[1:58:34] skylightxo: @Minpojke Not from WoW
[1:58:46] skylightxo: No, you make a company for money only
[1:58:49] flackobalboa: @skylightxo wtf is current retail? brain tumor  rave party
[1:59:03] GarrinchA: blizz went downhill when they started caring less about the players and more about the company profit
[1:59:03] Turaxyy: they jsut did another thing because people wanted something else than the curent "wow" that was not good enough so people stopped
[1:59:11] Moobot:  Thank you for subscribing, @eks_skugga! :D
[1:59:13] skylightxo: @flackobalboa I wasnt attacking Wrath arena, I think its very relaxing and I like that xD
[1:59:20] kronyxius: watching reckful prebomb a spirit link live isn't the same as watching some csgo player get an ace with a pistol.  there's no comparing the two lol @ekunx

[1:59:56] qulxx: Honestly tho, retail pvp is unwatchable imo. And the problem with wotlk is that it is too stale. It feels very scripted to me
[2:00:05] GarrinchA: when they announced diablo immortal previous to diablo 4, it was so obvious that now they only care about profit
[2:00:12] skylightxo: You playing Wrath literally tells them to not give a fuck about Esports/Retail, what else are you telling them by still giving them money?
[2:00:24] Xeriyo: I mean, blizzard isn't giving a shit if the pvpers of the game stop paying/playing
[2:00:26] Xeriyo: such a small minority

[2:01:44] skylightxo: IQ*
[2:01:51] gekurt: @skylightxo you clearly want the community to do what you prefer
[2:02:07] skylightxo: @gekurt No, I'm saying if the community want X, they need to show it.
[2:02:30] gekurt: yeah but noboday wants esports or retail arena KEKW
[2:02:37] skylightxo: You can't say "Man I want Blizz to make WoW Arena great!!!" but then you still give them money when they don't XD
[2:02:47] skylightxo: @gekurt Lol okay, good one!
[2:03:09] sunnylaneog: they milk where they can 1 mount made more than starcraft 2.. from a board members aspect i can understand it.. from a consumer i hate it
[2:03:11] parmejohn__: they should take out arena and make arena its own game
[2:03:15] skylightxo: And you have people like Raiku bitching on Twitter 24/7 that "devs dont care" - yeah guess why?
[2:03:21] Xeriyo: who is giving them money anyway
[2:03:21] ekunx: FirstTimeChadder
[2:03:24] Xeriyo: dont ppl just use gold for sub
[2:03:28] Xeriyo: and u get gold from gdkps passively
[2:03:30] skylightxo: @sunnylaneog EXACTLY DUDE. You're the only one who understands lol.
[2:03:33] j4fmate: @parmejohn__ arena tournament in a nutshell
[2:03:49] sunnylaneog: @skylightxo  cus they are being emotional instead of logical
[2:03:49] skylightxo: @parmejohn__ Agree.
[2:04:06] skylightxo: @sunnylaneog They actually think people protesting with wallets wouldn't make a change. Lol.

[2:05:10] drumcodigo: @skylightxo dude understand most of the ppl that play this game dont care about pvp, they just like the pve part of it
[2:05:43] drumcodigo: so a minority "protesting" wouldnt make any diff
[2:05:46] skylightxo: @drumcodigo Sure, so the solution is to what?

[2:06:09] skylightxo: Play Classic? xD
[2:06:14] jamminlove: @skylightxo You're so dense you can't see beyond your own ass. Players don't protest, players play games to have fun. They'll pick whatever game they have fun in and play it.
[2:06:37] ekunx: D:
[2:06:47] jamminlove: Its up to the company to realize why players are swapping to play something else, and make their offer more appealing
[2:06:48] skylightxo: @jamminlove That's fine, but then same players can't cry when they help a company profit in other ways than through the way they would personally want
[2:06:51] drumcodigo: @skylightxo why do u think people play classic?
[2:06:57] jamminlove: You have the most naive take I've ever heard
[2:07:08] drumcodigo: i play it cuz i feel like wrath is waaaaay more enjoyable than retail
[2:07:12] skylightxo: @drumcodigo Less skill, more chill gameplay, more streaming content, etc
[2:07:16] jamminlove: Players can and will cry, because its up to the companies to fix their game, not the players to fix it for them
[2:07:19] skylightxo: @drumcodigo How?
[2:07:35] gekurt: @drumcodigo no you are clearly protesting against retail arena, esports KEKW
[2:07:46] jamminlove: "less skill" is a great take
[2:07:47] skylightxo: @jamminlove Nonsense. Companies look at what consumers do. If you reward a company in any way, they are happy.
[2:08:05] ekunx: @drumcodigo it's like you don't love wow esports at all!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2:08:19] drumcodigo: @skylightxo whats ur logic on the "less skill" part?
[2:08:40] ekunx: alkXD alkXD alkXD
[2:08:45] WorriedAU: KEKW
[2:08:46] skylightxo: @drumcodigo Less spells, slower pace, fewer specs, fewer maps... etc
[2:09:29] jamminlove: Ur like that one climate-friendly dude that blames all their friends for not recyling instead of the corporations who cause the actual issue.  Yes I get that you're pissed off your expansion is dieing and that players are leaving for something else, but put that anger onto blizzard not players ya dumbnuts
[2:09:51] skylightxo: @jamminlove Corporations aren't the cause, it's the consumers
[2:10:02] jamminlove: ok :)
[2:10:05] whiteboy_ent: time for communism
[2:10:22] skylightxo: It's your fucking fault travelling to Mallorca every month or whatever, buying new clothes every week, etc
[2:10:23] kronyxius: i'd just drop it, you're not gonna make any progress with them KEKW  @jamminlove
[2:10:29] Kawaiiti: arguing on twitchchat kekw
[2:10:29] skylightxo: @kronyxius "them"
[2:10:30] jamminlove: Players should def not play what they like and just afk in the name of justice
[2:10:34] jamminlove: ur right
[2:10:44] kronyxius: idk your pronouns
[2:10:45] kronyxius: next
[2:10:53] Kawaiiti: ZIE / ZEM
[2:10:55] skylightxo: @jamminlove Exactly. Let your wallet do the talking.
[2:11:11] skylightxo: @kronyxius My pronouns are Hua/Wei, ty
[2:11:12] jamminlove: I use my wallet to tell blizzard I enjoy wrath arena more than retail
[2:11:21] jamminlove: You use your wallter to tell blizzard you like a shittier version of that
[2:11:25] drumcodigo: @skylightxo trading cds and w8ing on damp is way harder
[2:11:36] skylightxo: @jamminlove That's fine. I'm happy you enjoy Wrath. But same time, don't cry that Esports Arena will never be a real thing :)
[2:11:44] skylightxo: I am NOT saying you shouldn't enjoy whatever you want.
[2:11:53] skylightxo: But you MUST accept the consequences of your decisions at the same time.
[2:11:57] Foffel: it has never been a real thing, just drop it

[2:12:53] WorriedAU: EZ
[2:12:58] skylightxo: @jamminlove He was complaining about que times and shit, so I'm saying you need to accept WoW arena and esports is shit for a reason.

[2:59:00] Odezq: u coudlve bop or save his ass
[2:59:25] malyoyo: its actually cringe. he died cus he gambled, proceeds to search pojkes mistakes instead of admitting guilt
[2:59:31] bajhheera: didnt he just say feral did nothing only priest dmg? and he also says he dies with feral disarm?
[2:59:33] bajhheera: is this guy ok
[2:59:50] Odezq: yeah exactly ^^

[3:03:05] Odezq: now his blaming u :D
[3:03:11] BkattLive: That's so common to die from 30-0
[3:03:23] utbiu: Shinta reviewing vods now
[3:03:44] Superii1: I feel like he should never touch the priest. You do so much better when just tunnel druid
[3:03:46] fortchx: basically every spec can do that much damage at this point in the game
[3:03:48] BkattLive: Lmao he lying
[3:03:59] Kinraya: Funny how they both review vods to blame eachother :D
[3:04:00] fryzfyr: this is getting uncomfortable. play with spottman for some good times
[3:04:10] cepsegnever: feral dpriest is not easy for warpal this ssn i swear, unless you do insane pressure on them and u need bis gear for that
[3:04:12] BkattLive: Priest had 2 seconds of hamstring when he bladestormed
[3:04:22] malyoyo: again... same thing :D haha

[3:05:17] cepsegnever: it's not that easy, kinda 50 50, if the feral is insane ur gonna lose many games as warpal @Odezq
[3:05:23] BkattLive: @odezq I win that match up often as dpriest feral
[3:05:30] BkattLive: Feel like it's 50/50
[3:05:47] fortchx: lower mmr favours feral dp more and higher favours wp more
[3:05:53] fortchx: all dependent on how good the wp is
[3:05:56] cepsegnever: warpal can't win if they don't keep pressure on feral priest, if feral priest are free playing they win by default
[3:06:07] cepsegnever: thats why at low mmr feral priest win most of the time
[3:06:12] cepsegnever: warpals dont do any pressure to them
[3:06:31] cepsegnever: and at high rating is rng, if feral dodges every mortal u cant rly do much
