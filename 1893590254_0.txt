[3:13:25] Slayer_Eagleone: swifty is WoW dying ?
[3:13:55] Pallyofhell: no its not dying FailFish
[3:14:07] Stromboli32: Man... that dude is stressed out
[3:14:11] Stromboli32: Lmao
[3:14:12] Slayer_Eagleone: its not?

[3:14:19] kuuekuuek: @Slayer_Eagleone yes
[3:14:20] Slayer_Eagleone: why do i have 1 hour solo shuffle queues then?
[3:14:23] Pallyofhell: not even close to dying
[3:14:28] Rygaros: damn thats cheap
[3:14:36] Pallyofhell: cause healers dont want to do solo shuffle
[3:14:43] Pallyofhell: thats why
[3:14:51] langfotkongla: do u still run your mastery thing
[3:15:07] Slayer_Eagleone: well they should heal shuffle so we can get faster queues
[3:15:30] langfotkongla: hell yeah
[3:15:30] Pallyofhell: or just remove the need for healers in solo shuffle
[3:15:33] Arkitek: go healer =)
[3:15:37] eoi_attritshun: @Slayer_Eagleone It isn't worth it for healers. We get screwed
[3:15:51] eoi_attritshun: @Arkitek I like this
[3:16:11] Pallyofhell: but to say a game is dead based on solo shuffle ques is pretty narrow mind thinking
[3:16:14] eoi_attritshun: @Pallyofhell The minute we remove the healer role from wow, it WILL be dying due to a mass exodus.
[3:16:30] Stromboli32: @swifty how os the electric bill with all those arcades turned on? :))
[3:16:38] Pallyofhell: no one said remove the role from wow. just solo shuffle @eoi_attritshun
[3:16:44] viirracocha: woaow , swifty w8ing? thats a new one!
[3:16:50] levendizz: Solo shuffle should be for rbgs not arena
[3:17:15] veonxd: rbg shuffle would be a nightmare
[3:17:15] eoi_attritshun: @Pallyofhell That is the beginning of removing it. If they remove from solo shuffle, many will quit.

[3:17:50] IcyFoe: solo shuffle is the best thing that has happened to wow in years.. and it still sucks cuz of que time
[3:18:13] levendizz: Randoms aren't rated so no one plays objectives
[3:18:23] seabass40: it just needs to be 1 round dlol

[3:18:42] eoi_attritshun: That is brilliant
[3:18:43] Pallyofhell: many wont quit FailFish like what line of thinking do you mean if they remove the need for a healer to lower the que times for a single mode means they're gonna remove healers all together
[3:18:52] Eliman101: @Swifty Hello friend hope your day is well!
[3:19:02] superzachdk: solo shuffle is fine the way it is they just have to fix mmr
[3:19:20] superzachdk: if it was 1 round no dps would que bc its 30 minutes for 1 arena
[3:19:30] Pallyofhell: removing the requirement to have a healer for solo shuffle que to pop doesn't mean you remove healers all together
[3:19:35] eoi_attritshun: @Pallyofhell yeah, it would be a first step towards a post-healer wow. How about fix the problem vs creating new ones?
[3:19:56] Pallyofhell: you clearly have no idea what you're talking about
[3:19:56] eoi_attritshun: @Pallyofhell i agree with 3v3 dps, just not the remove healer from solo idea.
[3:20:03] Pallyofhell: no one said remove them
[3:20:08] younglettuc: healers suck
[3:20:10] IcyFoe: need solo que in 2s and 3s
[3:20:10] Pallyofhell: holy
[3:20:15] eoi_attritshun: @Pallyofhell you just did...bro.
[3:20:26] Pallyofhell: i just said remove the need to have a healer to make the que pop
[3:20:26] superzachdk: i mean u can still get solo shuffs without healers if u get like a prot pally
[3:20:34] Lichbenasty: @younglettuc this is the mindset as to why healers dont que
[3:21:09] eoi_attritshun: @Pallyofhell nah you just now added the queue pop part. That makes more sense
[3:21:19] younglettuc: i just think it would be better without healers tbh
[3:21:40] superzachdk: i mean idk why healers wouldnt q if u win 3 rounds u get 50 accountwide conquest each time
[3:21:41] viirracocha: GZ on win
[3:21:43] Lichbenasty: why would healers want to play solo shuffle with hard stuck 1600s that pillar there heals?
[3:21:45] Pallyofhell: well i didn't think someone that little logic to not realize it
[3:21:45] eoi_attritshun: I think it should be tanks vs healers, out of spite.
[3:21:52] younglettuc: r heae shuld run u  mana faster

[3:22:07] eoi_attritshun: @Pallyofhell why be an prick? I don't understand...
[3:22:11] superzachdk: @Lichbenasty bad argument bc some healers play the same way and are the problem
[3:22:28] Pallyofhell: because you want to argue something before fully thinking it out
[3:22:39] Chadskee: Falafel?
[3:22:41] younglettuc: yeah it just creates spite
[3:22:48] eoi_attritshun: @Pallyofhell you want to argue without fully communicating so....your point?
[3:23:01] Pallyofhell: everyone else got the point but you LUL
[3:23:08] younglettuc: maybe remove pillars xD
[3:23:33] eoi_attritshun: @Pallyofhell sure they did. It took swifty saying it but yeah take credit.
[3:23:50] Pallyofhell: FailFish
