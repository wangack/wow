[1:16:30] Defeat_G: Morgan: Aura of Main Character Instant 10 minutes Cooldown  Every third chain yapping will spawn a pool of microphones randomly in the area. Soaking the pool successfully will buff raid with 10% increased damage. Failing to soak the buff every raid member will be affected by permanent yapping for the rest of the fight unable to prevent or mute the yapsters.   This ability will enrage the Main Character which will proc his local mute on random players who will not be able to communicate.

[2:02:09] Kristoc: Under such conditions there is no room for work and diligence because it is uncertain whether we will enjoy the fruits of our labor: and thus also no cultivation of the earth; no shipping or use of goods obtained over seas; no well-equipped buildings; no knowledge of the surface of the earth; no account of time; no art; no letter; no socializing with others. And worst of all: a constant fear and danger of a violent death. And human life: lonely, poor, disgusting, animalistic and short

[2:19:00] Kristoc: Under such conditions there is no room for work and diligence because it is uncertain whether we will enjoy the fruits of our labor: and thus also no cultivation of the earth; no shipping or use of goods obtained over seas; no well-equipped buildings; no knowledge of the surface of the earth; no account of time; no art; no letter; no socializing with others. And worst of all: a constant fear and danger of a violent death. And human life: lonely, poor, disgusting, animalistic and short @Riceyx

[3:34:14] Nibw: @smoshieqt go bed
[3:34:23] kenpachie11: I was checking through various speedruns, and common in the end around 10million from the disc priest healing was absorbs from shields. Wouldn't it be better for them to spec reflect so 40% of that is damage done to enemies? they only lose like 10% mana cost on flash heal for it (irrelevant)
[3:34:27] jmar291: catJam
[3:34:28] kenpachie11: serious quesiton, not sure how the talent works
