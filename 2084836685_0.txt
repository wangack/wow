[0:11:24] somancy: Man I did the beta testing for Cata back in 2010 fuck off ICANT
[0:11:26] Theliahh: season 3 shadowlands was when you disappeared I think
[0:11:26] IAttackYou: @HansGuckIndLuft i think so

[0:13:42] OlaF_oo: i kinda hope dorki loses so he joins watchparty
[0:13:43] seriousalsa: did you see the new weak aura for M+ that calculates your health for defensives?
[0:14:07] Mindris_: when does mdi start?
[0:14:08] Theliahh: dont calculate just send it
[0:14:14] hdott52: @Mindris_ 30 mins
[0:14:16] IAmSolari: is preservation evoker any good?
[0:14:18] Mindris_: ty
[0:14:56] IAmSolari: ah Sadge
[0:14:59] mexnaq: 0 pres evokers in title range rn
[0:15:15] IAmSolari: they're all in aug jail
[0:15:17] IAttackYou: we down bad
[0:15:23] Farnswerth: pres rise up
[0:15:25] IAttackYou: do you think title range should be by spec
[0:15:30] Noyus_: when does it start?
[0:15:35] guynormally: it's a pres unfriendly season. some fights I'm getting outranged left and right
[0:15:37] caveman2x: presvoker Aware
[0:15:40] IAttackYou: I honestly think so
[0:15:58] HansGuckIndLuft: just do one key as surv and get title
[0:16:11] IAttackYou: yeah, but it is easier for spec that is better because class is better
[0:16:16] IAttackYou: you can get into group easier
[0:16:16] lilwayneswagy: title range by spec would just be meta + the 1 surv hunter
[0:16:25] ok_tk: just more reason we need bettre rewards between title and KSM
[0:16:33] zerossussy: per class 0.1% would be bad LOL
[0:16:35] dimsy__: or they're fcked xdd
[0:16:40] Pillzaren: skill issue xdd
[0:16:49] empl0de: whatup kitty
[0:17:12] zerossussy: u might get title at 3k rio as survival hunter
[0:17:15] BigTrout3: MAJORW
[0:17:16] zerossussy: or 2k rio as frost dk
[0:17:17] zerossussy: KEKW
[0:17:29] caveman2x: frost dk title lol
[0:17:39] casom2727: I am just gonna stick to brew, its the most fun I have
[0:17:40] zerossussy: mage tower was a thing for rewarding specs in legion i guess
[0:17:42] Meteox: Suske
[0:17:43] Tomq0: you smoke that zaza prob
[0:17:44] zerossussy: we just want something like that back again
[0:17:52] Noyus_: who will you be watching MDI with?
[0:17:54] yourfavoritegorf: yoooooooooooo grom stream
[0:18:05] mexnaq: tabards would go hard
[0:18:11] Theliahh: there's always "more rewards"
[0:18:20] Celestial990: Why doesnt m+ have some recolor set of that tier man Sadge
[0:18:20] lord_rimheart: toys Pog
[0:18:21] easley___: there should def be reward every 1k or 500k IO
[0:18:27] zerossussy: yea why not rewards
[0:18:30] caveman2x: they can literally give tenders now
[0:18:34] dimsy__: m+ is minigame and needs no rewards xdd
[0:18:37] Celestial990: Doesnt even need to be some crazy new challenge mode type set, just recolor the tier
[0:18:50] Basic_3: I think they're afraid of giving rewards out that people want to get... at key levels that they clearly don't give a shit about balancing.
[0:18:52] zerossussy: people like wow competitvely now
[0:18:56] IAttackYou: You are absolutely right. I would take definitely the downside though. You are also encouraging people to play those specs as well though, so the gap will also be smaller.
[0:19:07] dimsy__: BASEG
[0:19:13] GodsFaithInHumanity2: exactly
[0:19:22] zerossussy: gladiator mount for 0.1% title is great
[0:19:30] IAttackYou: so likelihood of 3k title range is lower
[0:19:36] lilwayneswagy: giving people something to chase outside of top .1% cant make people play less
[0:19:44] Basic_3: If they start rewarding all 25s, or 3500, it starts to become more obvious that the WC spike boss isn't balanced at a 27+ or w/e
[0:19:52] ok_tk: rewards/KSM, etc are already by spec. doesnt matter what you do it on
[0:19:53] zachl_: that would be dogshit
[0:20:00] IAmSolari: giving people incentive to push outside their comfort zone is cool, I'm an infinitely better player than I was even in s1 just because I've been chasing rewards... now I'm doing 25's and it feels a bit pointless
[0:20:03] zerossussy: imagine aiming for title as vdh @yumytv
[0:20:14] zerossussy: or as aug last season
[0:20:15] zachl_: you would just have all the non meta classes getting carried by the meta classes
[0:20:24] zachl_: spec based title sounds dogshit
[0:20:27] goilen: @yumytv should be per spec and 0.1 (not a full solution) but can have "thundering hero" and "thundering monk" or smth
[0:20:30] dimsy__: brewmaster Sadeg
[0:20:35] gfvaris: change to 20+
[0:20:38] popularviber: would aff even have enough players to have a title player xdd
[0:20:44] lilwayneswagy: @zachl_ yea it would be exactly that top surv hunter is with a veng dh mw aug and mage
[0:20:47] roostrr42: i play warrior healer, warrior warrior and warrior tank.. other specs can suck it
[0:20:48] dimsy__: xdd
[0:20:50] zerossussy: check melee dps KEEKW
[0:20:52] zerossussy: KEKW
[0:20:59] cochiko: The .1% title and the class/spec titles can both exist and just be separate (like the pvp elite titles)
[0:21:00] Theliahh: @zachl_ yeah there would 100% be degen shit
[0:21:01] WolfL1nk: GIGACHAD
[0:21:01] Basic_3: Ah, the reworked class is 50x more popular, yes, hmm, yes
[0:21:02] goilen: Everyone says "f the meta" until the meta comes at them
[0:21:08] Celestial990: VDH is around 75% of title tanks right now
[0:21:11] itsMint: it is
[0:21:20] zerossussy: melee dps is a funny one
[0:21:24] easley___: Tanks are weird though, the actual playstyle is a lot friendlier to just swappign to the good tank every tier
[0:21:36] IAmSolari: god I wish brew was good it's so much fun
[0:21:52] zamow1994: would be cool
[0:21:54] zachl_: @cochiko no, because some specs it would be harder to get than others
[0:21:54] zachl_: imagine getting .1 vdh title rn
[0:21:58] ok_tk: but the only way to get title is to play meta, so maybe
[0:22:04] IAttackYou: @yumytv your view of this statistics is also skewed by the fact that it is what it is... If you shift it then other people would go elsewhere for title or something maybe
[0:22:04] zachl_: it would be 3800
[0:22:08] clickermekk: if i could get title without playing meta i would.
[0:22:08] zachl_: and who is going for that
[0:22:09] surtakscythe: would 100p reroll do evoker heal for title
[0:22:17] TripleXTN: so they can play
[0:22:17] lord_rimheart: the thing about not playing meta is that your whole group has to agree to it. maybe they all want to play offmeta
[0:22:20] cochiko: @zachl_ Imperfect yes, but better than what we have now
[0:22:20] Idiotiquee: Nah, s3 keys without silence sigil are miserable
[0:22:25] TaterTacoTots: Honestly, I'm one of those Brewmasters, and I thank the stars daily that there's so few of us
[0:22:31] Theliahh: rerolling, gearing, and pushing on an alt just because it's unpopular to get title sounds like hell
[0:22:35] waelrick: shamans Aware
[0:22:45] nightbreeze93: ASSEMBLE
[0:22:47] zachl_: @cochiko no cause .1 of one spec is gonna be 3200… that shouldn’t be rewarded
[0:22:58] Basic_3: 4 specs aren't even on that list
[0:23:04] TripleXTN: shaman damage is actually so good, makes keys go so fast. but can't live, so
[0:23:05] Theliahh: shaman Sadge
[0:23:10] nightbreeze93: juno Sadge
[0:23:13] zerossussy: KEKW only 5 shamans will get title or something
[0:23:15] ok_tk: maybe there is a floor. Title = min io regardless of spec
[0:23:18] IAttackYou: yeah, but anything is better than this
[0:23:23] burne114: They should sell title in the official shop for $100, who says no?
[0:23:23] Goku_Flexx: what if you get a title specific to that spec
[0:23:25] clickermekk: devastation down bad i guess
[0:23:33] cochiko: @zachl_ That's because there's no reward for it now; don't underestimate how competitive people would be if there *were* a reward
[0:23:48] zynklu: thats me :)
[0:23:51] Goku_Flexx: feels like there is nothing between ksh and title and there is a huge gap
[0:23:55] easley___: it feels great to be #X on my server tbh
[0:24:05] easley___: even if my server is small and only 3 vdh are in title range
[0:24:14] PinkTaricFTW: When is MDI btw? Is it in 24 minutes?
[0:24:15] easley___: well not small, just not a big PVE server
[0:24:23] KaladinHS: why havent you done keys in weeks
[0:24:25] Vuchs42: top % from every spec would be cool
[0:24:26] Ayije: any predictions for today?
[0:24:27] unodapally: What's the title cutoff going to be? Is there any good push weeks left?
[0:24:31] IAmSolari: top rated healer is nearly 4k io
[0:24:44] throwmasterlol: its a fucking grind
[0:24:47] zachl_: @cochiko we should be rewarding good play- not rewarding you playing mediocrely on a bad class
[0:24:48] IAmSolari: you stopped pushing to be fair
[0:24:53] zachl_: hope that makes sense
[0:25:02] Goku_Flexx: eclipse dark horse
[0:25:07] lord_rimheart: last hope will shit on echo Prayge
[0:25:15] maristin: echo will win and it won't be competitive
[0:25:16] WolfL1nk: Eclipse sending Echo to lower
[0:25:21] indigo_octopus: Dawgs
[0:25:21] meikev3: when does it start?
[0:25:27] hdott52: @meikev3 20 mins
[0:25:31] MadeByiPaX: last hope #1
[0:25:32] majestictaco0: every team is sick this cup it's hype
[0:25:33] cochiko: @zachl_ The whole point of this conversation is that we should have MORE rewards, lol.  The top rewards won't be going away
[0:25:37] Ajatus: Prayge i hope dorki backseating elden ring didnt take away from their practice
[0:25:38] othernewname: last hope
[0:25:38] diamondq8i: can i pet the dawgs ?
[0:25:39] mexnaq: i hope to see 3 maps in every game today
[0:25:40] IAmSolari: I'm excited to watch max talk over 4 people for 3 hours
[0:25:41] TripleXTN: echo
[0:25:41] waelrick: legendary vs perplexed and bandits vs dawg s should be bangers
[0:25:44] IAttackYou: NA's Last Hope
[0:25:44] zerossussy: grand finals will be absolutely CRACKED
[0:25:45] lord_rimheart: underdawgs PepeLaugh
[0:25:53] othernewname: dorki chatted too much dawg
[0:25:55] zachl_: @cochiko i’m all for rewards! just not for the wrong reason lol
[0:25:56] throwmasterlol: bald bandits own
[0:25:58] gfvaris: legendary ez
[0:26:14] zerossussy: wow is live
[0:26:14] ebicman67: i just want guaranteed throne of the tides
[0:26:16] blort___: dawg
[0:26:17] IAttackYou: https://7tv.app/emotes/6525579036fe858ee2f30df6
[0:26:18] IAmSolari: I'd kiss Meeres tbh
[0:26:20] IAttackYou: add BOBER
[0:26:25] cysa_: i want the most BRHs possible
[0:26:25] quov123: i bet £10 that last hope lose in lower bracket to echo
[0:26:31] zachl_: i’m not at my computer attack
[0:26:35] zachl_: dm me on discord
[0:26:37] zerossussy: eh
[0:26:39] TripleXTN: based
[0:26:42] zerossussy: solo queue is just a bad idea man
[0:26:45] pseudobudo: WIDEHUHH
[0:26:45] PinkTaricFTW: LFG v2.0 ?! o_O
[0:26:47] zerossussy: especially for high keys
[0:26:47] guynormally: just balance the game 4Head
[0:26:48] cochiko: @zachl_ No need to gatekeep them; we play WoW for rewards, if somebody wants to be the top rated arms warrior in the world and get a dumb title for it, let them
[0:26:50] Theliahh: is 10.2.6 solo que
[0:26:50] BigTrout3: solo queue Prayge
[0:26:54] caveman2x: a solo ladder would be so sick
[0:26:55] waelrick: ppl will just leave dungeons more
[0:26:57] x00p: soloqueue would be amazing, but also a toxic hellhole
[0:26:58] gfvaris: I honestly do not see that m+ has a problem dont know why ppl are dooming over everything xD
[0:26:59] MadeByiPaX: m+ shuffle
[0:27:05] Goku_Flexx: is there an official bracket prediction?
[0:27:05] Ajatus: BASEG
[0:27:07] BigTrout3: season 4 fated solo queue shuffle please blizzard
[0:27:07] othernewname: i think its a good idea but both queues should co exist
[0:27:10] fleks27: not really no
[0:27:13] fleks27: xdd
[0:27:16] nivereno: Queue is good, but also just making the cross character gearing better and like changing the key system somehow could also go a long way
[0:27:17] potatofarmer: if me and the apes that play league can solo q people in wow can solo q
[0:27:25] Cruzerthebruzer: USA
[0:27:28] zachl_: solo shuffle is dogshit i don’t have much faith for m+ solo
[0:27:39] Carelezz: @yumytv  co stream with max?
[0:27:40] Theliahh: @fleks27 did u get cata beta
[0:27:43] mexnaq: id play it and im not a streamer
[0:27:52] nivereno: Solo queue is great beacause you can like do shit while quing instead of being stuck clicking lfg for hours
[0:27:58] MadeByiPaX: YEP
[0:27:59] Baylinz: solo q pvp is dead
[0:28:00] IAmSolari: STREAMERSGIVINGTHEWORSTFUCKINGTAKESINEXISTENCE
[0:28:02] lord_rimheart: solo queue would need a seperate point system + a punishment for leavers. add some unique rewards and it might be fine
[0:28:03] IAttackYou: I'm Elden Ring viewer
[0:28:06] roostrr42: hell yeah
[0:28:07] troxleer: YEP
[0:28:07] nivereno: Finally not benhced Kappa
[0:28:08] ok_tk: is there an mmr and we group by io? then i'd do it
[0:28:09] TripleXTN: you have such based takes, honestly
[0:28:11] skarg__: YEP
[0:28:13] DuckkiTV: YEP
[0:28:17] Baylinz: and filled with bots
[0:28:21] Cruzerthebruzer: I don't think blizzard can do m+ solo queue correctly but I would probably only play it.
[0:28:25] hamwise_: as long as it's not as toxic as pvp solo que
[0:28:26] goilen: @yumytv Soloq would be good for the community if only because it would make weekly 20s much less of a pain for everyone instead spending 30mins looking for a comp that doesnt matter
[0:28:29] GrowlFan420: wildigW
[0:28:33] Coreals7raz: you will be able to play a solo healer without anyone flaming you ...
[0:28:34] Theliahh: I wish zaelia streamed keys
[0:28:39] throwmasterlol: that would be some mad mental suffering
[0:28:41] GrimFandango: I don't like the potential thought of my shitty play being farmed for content KEKW
[0:28:50] Tarithal: It would just be something to do
[0:28:52] IAmSolari: Thaner doing keys with Noobadin
[0:28:55] Goku_Flexx: the mmr would be scuffed
[0:28:55] cochiko: @yumytv Solo Q feels foreign now, but it's how every game has worked for decades and it would probably feel normal within one season (if they put the work into it)
[0:28:56] Tarithal: Need more things to do
[0:29:03] bardabrax: inb4 you get brewmaster, resto sham, 3 eles. how you clear anything even remotely high
[0:29:05] Theliahh: I will succeed 100% :)
[0:29:16] ripbossqt: does zmok do 4 dps 28's?
[0:29:22] ripbossqt: or like 4 warrior / pala keys
[0:29:35] ok_tk: imagine not getting someone who can do an affix tho
[0:29:41] Goku_Flexx: its always 50/50 you either time it or you have a non-meta comp
[0:29:41] YuzukiKaze: plink
[0:29:42] WrathofBambi: Solo queue better have a guarantee of bl and br
[0:29:48] ok_tk: a group where no one can do an affix*
[0:29:59] BigTrout3: solo queuing 25s sounds like good content. sometimes the key's good, sometimes it's content
[0:29:59] TripleXTN: and maybe you'd still get points for depleting if it was only by like 2mins or something, just base it on the average of keys at that level
[0:30:00] OgiNamikiri: not super related but would be cool to see how high a comp of the 5 worst specs would go
[0:30:04] waelrick: ppl talking in wow WutFace
[0:30:05] MadeByiPaX: 3 hunters no utility uuh
[0:30:06] TaterTacoTots: at least you'd be able to do weekly keys without having to wait 2 hours per dungeonfor a non meta spec
[0:30:07] cochiko: @ok_tk If we're lucky, this leads to them just redesigning the affixes
[0:30:07] Hengeko: But then also change that drums are like bloodlust pls
[0:30:10] carrwreck2: fuck, I’m just glad I timed a 19 with a PUG last night w/ my resto shammy
[0:30:15] caveman2x: those affixes are just dog
[0:30:16] DuckkiTV: just remove the affixes in solo q kekw
[0:30:21] YuzukiKaze: pls
[0:30:24] ripbossqt: imagine the comps tho...be so cool and rando
[0:30:25] dethbybunnies: que as tank but plays dps EZ
[0:30:27] MierkaBlue: resto shaman and ele are not that bad, they are not popular and they are a bit behind but in capable hands they are not *that* far off
[0:30:27] Sprinklerz: 3x boomie groups pog
[0:30:27] IAttackYou: chat, help me make a pyramid of BOBER in warcraft chat
[0:30:34] Hymmer: HOLY
[0:30:36] skarg__: BASEG
[0:30:41] Ajatus: i think a complete affix overhaul will happen sooner than solo q existing so worrying about comp/affix stuff is meaningless at the moment
[0:30:42] maedoxxx: the ppl with the highest mmr just playing with each other all the time, making it a premade xdd
[0:30:42] ok_tk: it would be top content
[0:30:43] PinkTaricFTW: Wait 30 mins in the queue, get in, tank goes "ugh, THAT CLASS" and leaves. Another 30 mins in queue...
[0:30:44] waelrick: ok, id play the shit out of that
[0:30:44] IAmSolari: do mdi pulls
[0:30:44] TripleXTN: I mean, would it have problems? keep tyra and fort, remove the others?
[0:30:47] zerossussy: if they make solo queue a special no affix that would be a banger actually
[0:30:47] BigTrout3: HOLY that sounds fun
[0:30:48] ripbossqt: @MierkaBlue rsham blast the dps tho,
[0:30:59] GrimFandango: M+ Boss Rush solo queue PausersHype
[0:31:00] DuckkiTV: I'd Fucking solo q even as tank
[0:31:07] TripleXTN: truuuuue
[0:31:09] DuckkiTV: Survival hunter
[0:31:11] TripleXTN: that's big fair
[0:31:13] zerossussy: people will spam solo queue on bolstering weeks or sanguine KEKW
[0:31:17] MadeByiPaX: id start playing tank in solo shuffle
[0:31:22] gfvaris: bonus gear for tank :D
[0:31:23] MierkaBlue: @ripbossqt they do, I run with ele shammy who also plays resto and they are awesome
[0:31:30] nivereno: It might also make raider io a bit more reflective of where people are at
[0:31:33] nightbreeze93: if you implement solo Q you can also add more spec-specific scores, since they go into same pool
[0:31:34] nivereno: At least on the high end
[0:31:42] ok_tk: short queues for tank/heal is already a reward
[0:31:43] Tarithal: It might force more tanks which isn't a bad thing
[0:31:45] DuckkiTV: I think if solo q didn't have affixes but didn't count for title it would be sick for weeks that suck ass
[0:31:46] Rokjinu: solo queue would be fun for doing weekly keys on alts too probably
[0:31:49] lilwayneswagy: double crests for tank or healer
[0:31:49] cochiko: LFG systems already favor tank/heal queues since it's a 3:1 ratio so it shouldn't really be a problem
[0:32:02] razortanktv: you can hard carry groups on tank so they are almost already rewarded by being able to get higher io easier
[0:32:06] Destrolisher: HI hiii
[0:32:09] WrathofBambi: i'm not tanking soloqueue unless blizzard pays me for it
[0:32:11] throwmasterlol: just make the pigs sit in queue and wait for tank and healer
[0:32:23] TripleXTN: @WrathofBambi you do that already in LFG?
[0:32:30] zerossussy: yazma on 28 is impossible to die on if u are planning for a 32 i feel like it wont be a challenge
[0:32:38] ok_tk: its basically the pugging experience now
[0:32:39] Peepars: How well you can use the ping system?
[0:32:41] dwinchh: Id tank that
[0:32:44] Carelezz: when does it start?
[0:32:45] IAmSolari: make tanks do more damage
[0:32:48] Goku_Flexx: satchels for M+ when
[0:32:57] lilwayneswagy: can you duo queue or is it solo only??
[0:32:58] WrathofBambi: @TripleXTN I don't mind tanking in lfg
[0:33:00] thegod421: how would keystones work one person keys with their key others dont?
[0:33:01] Rokjinu: I think the second time you get flamed as a tank or healer you just stop solo queuing and go back to lfg
[0:33:02] MadeByiPaX: @IAmSolari even mor? uuh
[0:33:06] DuckkiTV: Same as solo shuffle no?
[0:33:08] cochiko: M+ is secretly the coolest video game Blizz ever made but it's currently buried in the monolith of WoW's systems
[0:33:09] TripleXTN: @IAmSolari no thanks. don't want another SL BDK soloing bosses at like 25s
[0:33:13] razortanktv: “streamers are playing it then people will want to play it” is the reality I always say that justifies designing the game for the top 1%
[0:33:17] Cruzerthebruzer: great word choice
[0:33:17] caveman2x: i agree there needs to be a comprehensive score that takes into account dmg taken, kicks, dmg done etc
[0:33:21] Destrolisher: catJAM
[0:33:21] Nightbot: catJAM
[0:33:24] ok_tk: can you choose your dungeon? imagine

[0:34:35] MadeByiPaX: small geo sesh while we wait?

[0:34:36] zamow1994: yea the hero thing seems like the wrong path
[0:34:38] Goku_Flexx: moonbear pog
[0:34:39] DuckkiTV: @Idiotiquee All mage specs are incorrect
[0:34:42] ok_tk: its basically tier sets
[0:34:44] chadderz7: CLASSIC
[0:34:45] zerossussy: yea it should be a cosmetic thing man
[0:34:46] GrimFandango: it sucks they're making Hero Talents when there's a shitton of actual Talent Trees that still need fixing
[0:34:53] Theliahh: they made a mistake calling them hero talents they should have just made it more talents
[0:34:53] zerossussy: quality of life things
[0:34:57] Larocca_88: All throughput talents should be deleted permanently.
[0:35:08] anxxylock: Hi all uhmhiii

[0:35:18] Destrolisher: HI anxxylock
[0:35:20] minglium: let's go Last Hope!
[0:35:20] TripleXTN: yeah, the fact they're mostly passive is hella lame, just makes it a "what does this guide say"
[0:35:26] lord_rimheart: hero talents it the new expansion thing right?
[0:35:26] Theliahh: alpha is supposed to be after 10.2.6 before season 4 so very soon
[0:35:29] Alkomz: once they announce smt as expansion feature they cannot go back
[0:35:55] Theliahh: @Alkomz they've done it before
[0:36:00] Celestial990: Play a tank or healer and play a tree other than what the discords say just to piss them off BASEG
[0:36:05] minglium: warm up  geogussr before MDI?
[0:36:06] GrimFandango: Hero Talents should have just added modifications to existing Class Tree capstones
[0:36:10] zamow1994: that should be the talent trees, just try to perfect them
[0:36:12] Theliahh: Cataclysm was supposed to have a power system called "Path of the Titans" and it was nowhere to be found ingame
[0:36:21] anxxylock: ascendancies xdd
[0:36:21] Theliahh: but announced at blizzcon
[0:36:22] zamow1994: Despairge
[0:36:26] nivereno: Hero talents would be a sick way of implementing support specs but they somehow said it's not gonna turn dps spec into support spec
[0:36:41] MadeByiPaX: artifact power? heart of azeroth? LOGIN
[0:36:41] razortanktv: I just wish they would take a larger risk with the hero talents. they all seem so insignificant to avoid pissing someone off
[0:36:44] Taiya: hero talents dont seem like enough of a system to carry an xpac
[0:36:50] chadderz7: NOWAY

[0:39:41] throwmasterlol: actually true though, speedsigns in norway will only be yellow background if there is roadwork
[0:39:48] FeistmasterFlex: africa is easy to guess if you know what countries have coverage, especially since they look wildly different between them
[0:39:55] Seraak: as a non geo player, whats card meta? just aim good and get rng?
[0:40:07] im_offended2020: Dorki is gonna get 2nd place

[2:22:38] anxxylock: Dancy
[2:22:41] XadanarGaming: @yumytv how would you feel if dungeon bans would be a pick/ban phase? Each team picks a dungeon they want to run and then each team bans a dungeon they dont want to run and the third map is what is left. Higher seed picks first.
[2:23:17] Satimy: I think you should be able to pick/ban specs
[2:23:26] Satimy: maps should be random
[2:23:36] anxxylock: pick ban specs is horrid
[2:23:41] seriousalsa: it would be alright if they only let you ban a dungeon once per weekend
[2:23:46] kitty0chi: seems like rogue > lock
[2:23:46] yujik46: banning specs would be dreadful
[2:23:51] JMaC727: pick ban specs would only be viable in a for fun event
[2:23:57] pony_waifu: you should be able to pick/ban players
[2:23:58] epilepticunicorn_: pick ban specs would make legion MDIs look clean
[2:23:58] Lottinius: ban all tanks EZ

[2:24:13] chadderz7: LETSGOOO 󠀀
[2:24:22] indigo_octopus: if you play a class on one map it's banned for the rest of the maps - that'd force class diversity

[3:53:28] baxx: i bet on dorki's details drohgoh is doing 50k dps
[3:53:47] MystikCitizen: @dethbybunnies Every single BM hunter in the game does that
[3:53:52] kiri4869: @MBG_95 thats wrong the phase is exactly 40s, and yeah you get 10s of not buffed damage vs just straight up losing 20 seconds of lust

[3:54:00] Indormi: My money is on mandatory but my heart is on Last hope
