[0:05:20] DaiKi_gg: @Scripe ohh so the orders havend even been sent out yet
[0:06:58] Eliannoula: 'If you did not hear anything about your merch order, it's because there ended up being some kind of technical error in the system at the time when people were ordering, so many orders were not marked as pre-orders and therefore those people did not receive the email updates that they should have been getting about their orders'
[0:07:02] Eliannoula: according to daisy

[0:28:33] chasen218: u was planning to play 4 aug in RWF?
[0:28:58] Jeff_dd: im still mentally recovering from wiping on yazma on 3% for not killing adds, nnot even spiders
[0:28:59] Jeff_dd: Sadge

[0:32:01] mohaso21: bielich132 he dotted all globes which ended  up killing multiple ones at once which made it not healable
[0:32:24] harambina: Meeres?

[1:02:22] boyan77: this boss is hardest in the game ..
[1:02:42] tvilk: I have been depleting everbloom all week
[1:02:43] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Scripe and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[1:02:50] ZeroEightG: like 400k per o.5 sec
[1:03:03] mixj1: you cant jump over fire also it will hit always
[1:03:05] tvilk: I'm not kidding when I say I have gotten to 6-7 runs of everbloom that dies on council
[1:03:31] rhaeswyn: Its cause the firestorm is RNG who it targets
[1:03:39] rhaeswyn: it can basicly shoot all fire's on 1 person
[1:03:39] Vlazzah: ded
[1:03:49] bielich132: @rhaeswyn pretty sure it cant
[1:03:57] boyan77: this boss need like 2x times nerf
[1:04:02] tvilk: all of them
[1:04:03] tvilk: it can
[1:04:06] bielich132: but the less players alive, the higher is the chance you get it more often
[1:04:10] kallisz: the fact that the cinders hit 1-4 at random is dumb
[1:04:11] wkd_blaze: shit is bugged or something it feels like
[1:04:20] tvilk: probability of you getting all the missiles is SUPER low
[1:04:24] tvilk: but its possible
[1:05:03] bielich132: does AoE DR evben work on that?
[1:05:21] kallisz: its not possible, its 1-4 on each person if everyone is alive
[1:06:09] kallisz: monk should either use chiji or sheluns on those. idk if he does it
[1:06:24] kallisz: and you should be healed mid ticks, but it hurts a lot
[1:07:42] mohaso21: such a great day for keys
[1:08:54] mohaso21: its  a toxic day you said

[1:46:03] assrug: @tvilk there is an interaction with some hard ccs (trap too) that make it so that only the first guy that gets close gets put into combat / aggroed, so if the tank aggroes the pack and then everyone walks by while he is still in combat with them they won't aggro the rest of the party, this is similiar to feign deaths/ vanish skips rogues/hunters can/could do in some dungeons
[1:47:17] jihibukaiii: @Scripe is it easy to gear up if i come back to the game now ? have not played for about 4 years

[2:35:12] mixj1: wrong dung?
[2:35:26] tvilk: !dw you listed as Fall
[2:35:40] mixj1: fall

[2:36:16] mohaso21: yes you will  take blame
[2:36:19] mohaso21: its not your 1st time
[2:36:26] tvilk: i agree
[2:36:32] tvilk: 2 against 1
[2:36:35] tvilk: D:

[2:37:23] mohaso21: iam gonna make sure i have less aggro on your main target
[2:37:27] DjinDjarinTTV: that previous sentence made no sense Xd
[2:37:43] Justflux: shamans die
[2:37:48] Justflux: there dmg is fine
[2:37:59] Lum3x: nah rsham does not die at least on 28
[2:38:03] tvilk: Shaman is like Druid.. They heal a lot. Except they have 0 personal defensives and less HPS
[2:38:13] Justflux: last boss on atal they do
[2:38:28] mixj1: and shaman mana is problem always
[2:38:40] Justflux: last boss atal is way overtuned on tyran
[2:40:02] mixj1: 20
[2:40:33] tvilk: Less than 100 resto shamans in the world has completed Atal 28
[2:42:07] tvilk: @tvilk it's relevant for when you say "I live that mechanic comfortably" you're not living it comfortably at the level where it matters.. Living it comfortably on a 25 or 26 is way different than a 28
[2:42:55] tvilk: lol
[2:46:29] Eliannoula: @Scripe if arthas is correct in his tweet we may expect dawntrail in early july ergo savage then in august! https://twitter.com/ArtharsFF14/status/1753746001993822308 keep an eye out for his tweet
[2:47:22] tvilk: @Eliannoula is there anything he's trying to avoid in terms of release of savage?
[2:48:01] Eliannoula: scripe to avoid? well, wow expac release
[2:48:22] tvilk: are we expecting a release this year? i haven't followed the news on it
[2:48:27] Eliannoula: yes
[2:48:36] Eliannoula: both expacs coming out this year
[2:48:37] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe
[2:48:42] tvilk: ah
[2:48:56] tvilk: guess its a good thing im saving my vacation days then
[2:49:04] Eliannoula: i just hope blizzard won't take this to 'compete' with the releases
[2:49:55] tvilk: didnt they change release date for something in shadowlands to comepete with endwalker or something like that?
[2:50:17] MasotaTV: @Eliannoula both expacs?
[2:50:26] tvilk: @MasotaTV wow and ffxiv
[2:50:27] Eliannoula: their releases coinsided but a lot speculate it was intentional. i personally do believe so as well but idk if true or not
[2:50:33] MasotaTV: @tvilk ah bet
[2:52:30] Vocox23: The scream has longer cd
[2:52:39] nurkurzhier: in the past you kicked in a dungeon 2-3 things, now every shit is multicasting 100000 things to kick. Guess people learned they need to kick sometimes
[2:53:20] nurkurzhier: I think DF this season is super worst. I think kicks are fine, if there is in a pul 1 or 2 things and once you kick, they remain silent for couple of sec
[2:53:31] lirly__: boomkin take
[2:53:35] chaosfangx: jinxed it
[2:53:40] nurkurzhier: but not like, I kick it and they just recast. And in a pull with 6 Trashmobs, 8 of them are casting xD
[2:53:48] tvilk: i dont think this season has been too bad with required kicks
[2:53:56] tvilk: but i also play vdh so maybe i just dont notice them
[2:54:05] Lum3x: @tvilk why did u time me out for arguing pro shaman i never said its easy to do but if not 100 shamans timed it is relevant shaman heal did a 30 tyra so why wouldnt i be able to survive 28 :) better timeout me again :)
[2:54:17] nurkurzhier: Shadowmeld @Scripe
[2:54:41] Eliannoula: @Lum3x no need for the last sentence pls
[2:54:41] tvilk: buddy you didnt do a 30 atal
[2:54:47] tvilk: stop talking please
[2:54:58] tvilk: move on
[2:55:09] Lum3x: just stating facts
[2:55:24] Eliannoula: and both pls just not converse with each other for a while
[2:55:28] Lum3x: thats why i said its not relevant to me
[2:56:22] tvilk: There are 2 resto shamans in the world that has done 30 Atal You're not one of them
[2:56:29] Lum3x: i never said
[2:56:44] Eliannoula: guys!
[2:56:47] Eliannoula: stop arguing
[2:57:06] Lum3x: Just saying broadly shaman is bad for 28 is wrong

[3:01:36] Eliannoula: chats doing chat things as per usual
[3:01:50] Eliannoula: differing opinions, but thats over now
[3:01:53] Eliannoula: no need to rehash
[3:02:21] Grillyo: knowing absolutely nothing what they were arguing about I'd confidently say without a doubt that they were wrong.

[3:06:40] Hozzar1: Which is stupid
[3:07:08] Grillyo: @Hozzar1 Wait, why are they rejecting you for a bootcamp? Isn't that generally pretty 'free' to get in? Are you missing pre-reqs or something
[3:07:19] Flokenx: I always shit my pants a tiny bit everytime this boss does any of his mechanics. Too many depletes. The ptsd is real

[3:14:07] Hozzar1: They do it this way so they don't have to do balance
[3:14:14] VenatFFXIV: I dont miss talents there
[3:14:22] Zolshy89: sounds boring
[3:14:37] Eliannoula: we already get another buff type job and a dps so thats then 21 jobs to balance
[3:14:44] Hozzar1: They want to have low maintenance game
[3:15:06] Hozzar1: Same reason trinkets aren't in the game
[3:15:35] FaieFaie: It's definitely a nice feeling when a tier releases and I know it's killable in our current gear and all without nerfs
[3:15:53] lamby_aus: i started doing m+ on wow recently and its nuts how much impact the trinkets have on your dps
[3:16:31] Hozzar1: Blizzard still needs to make a version of the boss where it's first killable state with the gear and consumes provided
[3:17:20] Hozzar1: Wtf was that
[3:17:25] Eliannoula: i just had the crazy idea of applying to echo as a part time crafter
[3:17:33] Hozzar1: Elli
[3:17:36] Hozzar1: I wouldn't
[3:17:48] tvilk: @Eliannoula I applied to echo as a part time chatter
[3:17:53] Hozzar1: You do enough as it is
[3:17:55] Eliannoula: i know, it would be a lot even as a full time crafter
[3:18:08] Hozzar1: I don't want to apply
