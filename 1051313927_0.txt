[9:05:54] lovelyzsj: jnbO
[9:06:00] Rhymnicate: @Arkders Depends on what you want to do! Just know that you're going to be lower priority for Raid groups (you'll have to play better and have better gear to break even with some of the other classes), so it might be harder to get in to raids/get the gear. Rogues are still very fun for pvp shenanigans, at least.
[9:06:44] Arkders: @Arkders Thats a shame! thanks for the the info
[9:07:57] Rhymnicate: @Arkders No problem! WoW has always struggled with uh... class balance from expac to expac. Rogues will be better in WotLK, so if you really like the class there's no reason not to play because they'll be more in vogue down the line again.

I find rogue quite difficult to play so, i feell struggling to find groups on top of that adds to the difficulty of the class
