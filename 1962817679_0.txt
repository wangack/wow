[1:01:39] ZonaGeeWon: cobaltComfy
[1:01:39] stoney_entertainment: cobaltHi @ZonaGeeWon
[1:02:14] BubTalks: Metagaming = Using information for your character that they wouldnt have/know
[1:02:36] BigOldDonkey: tbf tho it will take time for your mom to learn that skill
[1:02:37] stoney_entertainment: NODDERS
[1:02:39] yoimdylan: least favorite tainted character?
[1:02:41] Juli323232: I love the hat ❤️
[1:02:44] Draleric: !fav
[1:02:44] Nightbot: Cobalts favorite items are Magic Mush, Deaths Touch, Holy Light, Death Certificate. Favorite regular character is Isaac, tainted is Judas. Least fun is Tainted Cain. Most difficult is Tainted Lost and Tainted Jacob.
[1:02:46] Beelzfaster: For the instance of knowing a things weakness, how would you go about not metagaming that? like if you low rolled a perception check I wouldn't know how to act in that situation
[1:02:54] BigOldDonkey: i had a hard time in the beginning distinguishing between what I knew/what my character knew
[1:03:00] CabooseBakes: sk8bSip
[1:03:14] BigOldDonkey: 0 chance she's doing it intentionally; i loved her hat!

[1:03:30] kaiju_breath: Fuck rock waves
[1:03:38] stoney_entertainment: yep @BubTalks
[1:03:45] BigOldDonkey: yeah, it's hard NOT to metagame when you are new to tabletop
[1:04:19] BigOldDonkey: she was obviously having a fantastic time though lol
[1:04:27] BubTalks: That being said, I have a high hopes for Sunless Citadel crew
[1:04:32] kaiju_breath: Is JE the hardest character or do I suck
[1:04:34] stoney_entertainment: NODDERS
[1:04:36] TheMoltenGuy: I think that's one of the reasons why I'm not a huge fan of playing DnD myself since I don't like being forced to act like I don't have certain information

[1:05:24] Scaramax: The easiest way to deal with JE is uninstalling repentance
[1:05:25] DotDeltaDot: It is an awkward character to use
[1:05:28] kaiju_breath: I tried them on normal mode just to get birthright and I got wiped
[1:05:30] Juli323232: How does ludo work on this charakter do both shots get changed ?
[1:05:30] TheMoltenGuy: I find TLost easier than this character tbh
[1:05:40] Markeh04: JE is just annoying because you lose a lot of agency over the characters, most time on other charactesr you can avoid things but there are situations where JE will get hit and you can't do anything about it
[1:05:46] andrehunter1: id say this is the hardest non tainted character
[1:05:56] Justjake274: @Juli323232 no :) only one

[3:54:36] Superbaas88: @SattRahm so tests were done, and it's not unreasonable to take impacts in excess of 600 pounds to the balls and they are perfectly fine. Meanwhile, most of the bones, much less the skin, of your face will break with just a few hundred pounds of force.

[4:23:51] Sooperman23: I have played WoW since beta....no stress bro. i'm a clicker too
[4:23:55] IyaJenkei: just start out unbinding A and D and bind the 4 abilities you use the most to keys you like then add more as you get used to it
[4:23:56] GarthorPA: because I didn't want to rebind anything
[4:24:00] Nextsnowman: Q, R, E, V, T, Z, X are the first buttons to rebind to start expanding IMO
[4:24:01] captainfailure1: If you're really desperate Alt 0-9
[4:24:07] PanzerSnack: bartender?
[4:24:09] Nextsnowman: Bartender?

[4:29:23] paul95018: cobalt7 cobaltCool enjoy all
[4:29:45] GarthorPA: It was armor gear.  It was a silly time.
[4:30:05] Eldartau: Druid tanks are good in classic but you need to farm pummelers to make it less boring
[4:30:08] coozecontroll: yeah bears could build amazing armor so they couldnt get crit
[4:30:22] GarthorPA: There was no real solution to getting crit
[4:30:26] GarthorPA: I think maybe maxing out all the pvp gear?
[4:30:31] GarthorPA: you just had so much armor it didn't matter.
[4:30:44] Blaauwe: My favourite i’d say would be BWL. I also loved MC but that was my first raid ever so yea. AQ sucked and naxx was also great
[4:30:55] paul95018: may just rock a mage again
[4:31:08] GarthorPA: Anyway it was the Hakkar fight and I had more threat than him the entire time, even eating all the Madnesses (or whatever it was called)
[4:31:23] Eldartau: Ive just spent so long in Ulduar. I had such a different view of that raid back in the day
