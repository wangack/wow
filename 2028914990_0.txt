[0:46:01] zachgamegodx: think mely might
[0:46:02] klashenkov13: sub is way to op atm, literal one shot potential also should not be alowed to spec into duel and bomb together
[0:46:36] zachgamegodx: mw is one of those specs that really only benefits from 2 secondaries mastery and haste
[0:46:41] dre_day_3k: Good  just made some dinner, Salmon with fry veggies :)

[0:48:42] Sosatko: Bro that dinner on twitter looooooked insane
[0:48:47] zachgamegodx: thats because youre not in ice form ven../s
[0:48:59] hulkdieselx: the gear and vault drip is kinda crucial for keeping concurrent player interest through early season. no reason to uncap all together
[0:50:05] Caedalade: ye my alt is healer gear
[0:50:15] Caedalade: playing dev on it isn't as fun
[0:50:23] madcatbully: wish gear just didnt matter in pvp
[0:50:28] IAmFluba: @venruki are we going to see cataclysmic gladiator venruki tearing up with teracgosa wrath staff in Cata Classic?
[0:50:36] hulkdieselx: from blizz POV, buy a boost a have 2 priests... which is what a lot of people do. sucks but it makes them their $$
[0:50:37] Dwilk20: The change they need to make is every week Conquest weekly cap should be the same as the first week
[0:50:51] Dwilk20: PVErs get 4 different ways to get fully geared in the first 2 weeks
[0:51:01] Dwilk20: meantime pvpers are months into a season to get full geared
[0:51:17] IAmFluba: @venruki remember foul gift of the demon lord & moon chalice?

[1:43:45] julienb95: Is the stream title a reference to poker after dark?
[1:43:54] zachgamegodx: does anyone else think this outlaw talent is kinda insane https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198265/take-your-cut doesnt shaman have a pvp talent with 20% haste for 1 min cd and this things up at all times
[1:45:04] Magottx: pretty nutty yea. they take it over other talents?
[1:45:18] zachgamegodx: most do

[1:47:02] Magottx: "can yo unot heal" *grabs warrior onto himself*
[1:47:03] Mcaveryst: ask him if doing S1 dps in s3 is good
[1:47:37] croptopkaren: i play all the healers in shuffle and everytime you play a different one, you inspire me to play that one for the day too bc you make it look so fun lmao
[1:48:11] storm_chaser_ron: show chat

[1:49:49] Mcaveryst: lookin like a boomkin 6-0 lobb
[1:49:49] Arral13: go df season1 transmog instead, that look *chef's kiss
[1:49:54] sickness6sic6: best comp for demo?
[1:50:15] zachgamegodx: counteract is aite, but you'd have to fake every CS without aura mastery
[1:50:31] zachgamegodx: otherwise, i wouldnt replace zenspheres withit
[1:50:34] julienb95: Oh wow thats insane I had no idea.. I play alot of live poker as well these days
[1:50:55] sickness6sic6: @Fros365 would this be good with demo or aff?
[1:51:10] julienb95: The last 3 years more consistently prior was strictly online

[1:53:18] Gotheels: yeah hes #1 demo on ladder rn
[1:53:20] julienb95: Thats awesome hahahaha 😆
[1:54:24] jag_pvp: i think zen pulse is insane against demo but people think im crazy for playing it
[1:54:32] Fros365: @Fros365 Resto druid or resto sham could work better if you are playing aff or demo, since those comps tend to go to dampening imo
[1:54:49] storm_chaser_ron: unfortch, tried to play the game for 1 millisecond
[1:55:27] sickness6sic6: @Fros365 thanks for the advice bro
[1:55:40] Fros365: np
[1:57:46] Nemenon: nos is a gamer
[1:58:01] Yaycarrots: D:
[1:58:03] zenqqt: Ven looks like he has a curfew and a bedtime.
[1:58:43] Nemenon: I've been wondering, is smurfing bad for WoW PVP? I hear mobas ban people for that and I never saw it as a problem in WoW. Curious what you think.
[1:59:47] Zoxerz: use em or lose em bud
[1:59:57] iv9ry: yeah bag em
[2:00:03] Fros365: Your what? rukiS

[2:04:57] Swertson: is it weird that I'm obsessed with fire mage?
[2:05:06] Magottx: fire is so cool imo
[2:05:26] Fros365: Its fun, challenging to survive but fun anyways
[2:07:00] Gage_92: wasnt that fun

[2:09:06] dilly_wow: I been focusing on finishing up my phd
[2:09:12] dilly_wow: I kinda only play wow for PvE now XD
[2:09:24] dilly_wow: Yeah I am
[2:09:25] Swertson: played ele for a while, its more of a lightning mage to me
[2:09:29] foxyllama: hopefully he goes on the hub
[2:09:37] ellisrainy: maths
[2:09:39] dilly_wow: I could go into academia but it's pretty tedious
[2:09:39] xmostpalone: rename all chars to dr. dill
[2:09:45] dilly_wow: I like teaching but it's pretty brutal nowadays
[2:09:54] dilly_wow: so I'm probably going to look for government or cyber security positions
[2:10:05] dilly_wow: LMAO it's not my fav but it's a good one
[2:10:09] dilly_wow: My fav movie is silence of the lambs
[2:10:27] ellisrainy: yooo bro how u doing today?
[2:10:47] ellisrainy: 1 of my childhood friends actually just moved to canada to go into research after finishing his phd
[2:11:04] dilly_wow: canada has some good schools for that
[2:11:09] xmostpalone: researching maple syrup algos ofc
[2:11:11] chiasora: That demo was #1, 2, 3 and soon to be four demo on demo shuff ladder lol
[2:11:19] Yaycarrots: rukiCanadaEh
[2:11:25] dilly_wow: LUL
[2:11:39] ellisrainy: he did tell me but i can't remember, think it's opposite end from you iirc
[2:11:58] ellisrainy: UBC
[2:12:01] OwzyBrand: I'm Canadian and Im extremely offended
[2:12:06] dilly_wow: Yee I think most of the good schools for any sort of research or stem are like in toronto
[2:12:08] OwzyBrand: jk jk ♥
[2:12:48] dilly_wow: Doing research is fun but kinda sucks because you basically do 6 years of contract work before MAYBE getting a tenure track job
[2:13:19] ellisrainy: yeah my friend had the same complaint
[2:13:25] dilly_wow: I'll be able to play RMP after I'm done don't worry
[2:13:54] ellisrainy: he did his in compsci/AI though so I think he had more opportunities immediately available to him that made it a bit easier
[2:13:57] dilly_wow: LUL it's pretty fun most of math is kinda just like wow you just grind and beat your head into a wall
[2:13:59] ozzyxy: @dilly_wow I need math coaching.
[2:14:13] dilly_wow: DM @ozzyxy

[2:22:38] foxyllama: i started mine recently
[2:22:42] foxyllama: its weird tho
[2:22:49] foxyllama: their healing numbers just feel weird to me
[2:22:56] Extramediums: he's a fan
[2:23:05] UziiB: Hpal is good
[2:23:08] Fros365: "Greetings I am fan"
[2:23:24] What_ln_Tarnation: id much rather fight hpal than rdru in ss
[2:24:09] Nemenon: I feel like this rogue isn't using duel very well
[2:24:13] JJsChaos: Great toon.
[2:24:22] JJsChaos: tune
[2:24:26] xmostpalone: hoj rep is hard to deal with if ur dps dont have kicks keybound

[2:28:10] Nemenon: @shivwren icarus in shambles
[2:28:22] ellisrainy: liljohn just gives me the impression he thinks he's playing out of his mind idk why KEKW
[2:28:37] ellisrainy: i swear it's the trail that sprint leaves

[2:44:16] ognolove: ven if u beat wizx in 2s does that make u have potential to make it with the big dogs some day with more practice?
[2:47:30] zenqqt: Ven the type of guy to open a bag of chips with some scissors
[2:48:55] remylmfao: is there a point on going haste on lock if you are mostly instant casting and only bolting with backdraft or precog?
[2:50:03] arcane_p: where you get that staff from ven that mog is so good
[2:50:11] Diabolicalz: you go haste so that your cast bar goes faster so that melee panic and hit kick faster. obv
[2:50:28] PhDickens: trading post
[2:50:46] arcane_p: I must have missed that month
[2:51:15] remylmfao: would you say 20% haste is enough or do you think it should be closer to 30
[2:51:57] arcane_p: supatease mog is 🔥 too
[2:56:23] remylmfao: wp
[2:56:32] arcane_p: nice bro
[2:57:14] remylmfao: can you show your stats on this

[2:58:07] leeka: Im almost at 40% haste on my lock, i started to gem mastery
[2:58:12] Getblown: new world ven?

[2:58:59] leeka: @purkinji12 I streamed last night!
[2:59:08] leeka: no mage though
[2:59:20] remylmfao: I usually run 35% haste but I been messing around with 20% 55% mastery on an alt and it feels ok
[2:59:32] engzyng: damn flop is back
[3:06:51] arcane_p: ven with the big damage
[3:06:55] arcane_p: well played
[3:07:10] Borngood: NEED THE TEA

[3:09:09] Borngood: rejuv healing maybe
[3:09:21] blackheart1110: Would you be happy if they eventually remove drinking from arenas? obviously this state of game needs it, but would be nice to make a system without it
[3:09:23] rembrandt89: nerf the mastery?
[3:09:41] Borngood: reward druid for putting up more then bloom

[3:17:03] bump1: i still fell asleep
[3:17:38] bump1: i mean dont get me wrong, this is still better than peak LSD vs LSD
[3:17:40] bump1: but barely
[3:19:01] PeptoAbysmal: @TahoooB seems common in fighting games in particular for me, but not sure about other genres (if that's what you meant)
[3:19:17] dakotan517: its rough
[3:19:21] kusoneko: so true
[3:19:30] bump1: warrior is so balanced right now…
[3:19:36] bump1: outlaw > ww > war
[3:20:09] kusoneko: warrior feels like weakest melee besdies like feral or enh
[3:21:24] Magottx: feral is lowkey scary tho. they can pump with omega haste on clone.
[3:21:34] Magottx: feels like if youre not on your toes they can catch you off guard fast
[3:23:03] Magottx: you always wear a chain? i never noticed
[3:23:38] datsamuraiguy: ven ima need u 2 go to bed so that morning coffee with ven isn't too late
[3:24:07] bump1: morning with ven is important to a lot of us
[3:26:50] Magottx: wtf lol
[3:27:15] bump1: 10 stack arcane blast will do that
[3:27:51] bump1: *barrage
[3:28:08] Magottx: its too good man... i swear
[3:29:22] bump1: arcane has enough weaknesses it needs shit thats good lol
[3:29:33] bump1: 1 school, no armor
[3:30:56] arkuran_: would blink stun be better into that comp or not really?
[3:31:14] bump1: it should auto trigger it.. rather than purge with that talent
[3:31:44] Magottx: how you like your chair ven? i need a new one
[3:31:54] shocktopsx: nice music venruki
[3:31:58] Magottx: Can you link it
[3:32:31] Magottx: i will. how do you spell it?
[3:32:38] xenoie: can confirm great chair
[3:32:40] bump1: if you’re in the chair market, do what i did, find a store near you taht sells used office chairs. test them yourself
[3:32:51] xenoie: was $1200 new
[3:32:53] synerggaming: Yo Ven big fan! You should play with me and my duo sometime, we have been trying really hard to get better and weve been documenting our improvement
[3:32:57] bump1: i hated Herman miller

[3:33:16] stuttersx: remember aeion the wow killer
[3:33:32] cloggre: herman miller aeron
[3:33:35] bump1: chairs are like beds, built for different sized people
[3:34:03] Magottx: im incredibly average size. 5'9 185
[3:35:40] bump1: I’d say test a few nice ones out. i was gonna get the embody but Herman miller, was just not for me
[3:39:16] cloggre: chairs are strange. sometimes you find some cheaper one that works fo ryou
[3:40:17] cloggre: but, having a nice one thats just right pays off in the end
