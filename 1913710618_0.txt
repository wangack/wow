[7:45:36] dawnstrike: Sounds expensive
[7:45:43] issalar5: its kinda like new twist to good old basketball machines
[7:45:44] furiousgrizz: You could also have a booth with a large table in it and pay to room hire for things like TTRPG's
[7:46:22] furiousgrizz: D&D
[7:46:23] JulianFb12: Im sorry what kind of Baldur's Gate is it? Kappa
[7:46:28] brickelrick1: 9 finger discount imo
[7:46:30] furiousgrizz: D&D is getting really big again
[7:47:30] GuanHuan: maybe the warrior can be risked
[7:47:31] isaacr22: so how does Hardcore work after 60 if you die does your character still get deleted
[7:47:36] GuanHuan: but the priest... NEVER :)
[7:47:37] PopeJonas: Do green quests, that way you can relax a little

[7:48:13] ironmouse34: I'd say don't thrown too much in there ... if you want it to be about arcades then only have arcades
[7:48:48] connhor: !hcserver
[7:48:48] StreamElements: Swifty is on Skullrock server for official hardcore servers
[7:49:43] The_Crafty_DM: look up dwarven forge. was it that?

[7:51:14] babayagah93: i might know what your talking about. they have a table thats like corogated cardboard and you can pick and choose how you want to set it up plus its multi levels aswell
[7:51:21] furiousgrizz: I think what I was saying was your options are near endless when it comes to arcades, diversification isn't always bad
[7:51:32] MaksDiv: !followage
[7:51:39] MaksDiv: !follow
[7:51:45] ackingdiesel1: Youre doing what you said you shouldnt…. Not paying attention to your character lol
[7:51:47] MaksDiv: !followtime
[7:52:19] tjoernelol: bless you :D
[7:52:22] The_Crafty_DM: Swifty, look up the company Dwarven Forge. It may have been them.
[7:52:33] furiousgrizz: that's amazing
[7:52:40] Dlaw25: When did you start playing DnD?
[7:52:41] brickelrick1: sik dnd
[7:53:30] kirbz09: Sultan of swing
[7:53:57] Teagens: D&D would need to be in a private room where you can block out the game noises
[7:54:12] Dlaw25: Sold separately
[7:54:20] Teagens: D&D pieces are from Game Forge which makes the 3D miniature dungeon pieces

[7:55:36] phusing_tsb: 15k
[7:55:36] Dlaw25: Only $15k
[7:55:41] Bearman217: RIP
[7:55:46] Crunks_Lever: Gotta see if you can find a woodworker to make it
[7:55:58] Doopness: 15k$ for a nice table
[7:56:01] furiousgrizz: The website being called "this is why I'm broke" LUL
[7:56:20] avenomxx: Its DISCONTINUED
[7:56:20] jeezepvp: too big cant sit down and play
[7:56:34] Doopness: i didn't know D&D was a miniatures game
[7:56:36] Kaldeem: The best table for DnD is the table in front of you or where ever ur playing.
[7:56:50] kirbz09: I saw this video of this guy he made his own dnd table with a tv screen inside of it. It was really nice.
[7:57:20] iambizk: Hello swifty! Good to see you bro! Hows hc going?
[7:57:34] furiousgrizz: @Kaldeem As a frequent D&D player, I have to agree you don't need to make it complex
[7:57:35] luluzyz6: So hard to kill
[7:57:36] Robert_88_Nor: What nameplate addon are you useing to show debuffs swifty 😊?
[7:57:46] Zratek: did you die already?
[7:58:36] EhBud: No more zug zug??
[7:59:04] Robert_88_Nor: Maybe you can find it used?
[7:59:22] omgherb: just dont fight a mage
[7:59:33] EhBud: Gotta go engineering
[7:59:34] yuxia369: What about your priest?
[7:59:37] MARXIST__MAGGOT: is intercept level 30 i think
[8:00:06] Dlaw25: Swifty, have you played Baldur's Gate 3 yet?
[8:00:17] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:00:27] Kaldeem: @furiousgrizz Yeah man, i feel like all the streams and celebs promoting dnd make everyone want the best and most meta players. Dnd is so good w/ pen paper and IMAGINATION!!
[8:00:30] The_Mpower: did you saw the video about duel, the guy accepted duel he thought he's dueling level 1 but there was a high level guy with kinda same name as level 1
[8:00:51] Teagens: Etsy is a good website
[8:00:59] Teagens: Lots of skilled and amazing artisans on there
[8:01:03] EhBud: Maybe ebay??
[8:01:09] brickelrick1: i saw that lol
[8:01:09] phusing_tsb: that priest almost lost
[8:01:10] Teagens: Can find a lot of cool, unique creations on Etsy
[8:01:12] kirbz09: Etsy is my addiction
[8:01:12] furiousgrizz: I think what I was saying earlier about a D&D table was your options are near endless when it comes to arcades, diversification isn't always bad. It all depends on what you'd like.
[8:01:20] Teagens: @kirbz09 Right? xD
[8:01:31] brickelrick1: had a lvl 1 with alost the same name was brutal
[8:01:43] HeathnGaming: my message wasnt posted, i was just telling you about my rogue dying at 15
[8:01:48] SVO_Breezy: is there a clip lmao
[8:01:50] SVO_Breezy: thats funny
[8:02:39] kirbz09: Bodie
[8:03:02] Crunks_Lever: That would have been bad
[8:03:09] yeti_noise: !hcserver
[8:03:09] StreamElements: Swifty is on Skullrock server for official hardcore servers
[8:03:10] Teagens: Might want to go back to a TOWN
[8:04:08] furiousgrizz: @Kaldeem Exactly, a pen, paper and if you really want to go all out you can print off a map. But it's all about using your imagination you don't need to spend a ton of money playing D&D....well except buying source books...ugh
[8:04:24] brickelrick1: so meny ppl would sign up to dnd with u would break the system
[8:04:47] norimji: That table can be used for more than just dnd too
[8:04:48] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:04:48] Kaldeem: @Swifty This is prob one of the best TTRPG gaming table makers out there. ***
[8:05:24] furiousgrizz: oh, I admit it's awesome, expensive but awesome
[8:05:31] Kaldeem: Wyrmwood
[8:05:37] Kaldeem: company
[8:05:47] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[8:05:55] norimji: oh the wyrmwood is cool
[8:06:01] EhBud: You can probably give a woodworker those specs of what you want made and they can remake that based on the design
[8:06:34] Kaldeem: They have a bunch of different configs
[8:06:36] Kaldeem: and tables
[8:07:03] kmike321: That’s pretty cool.  It that table is probably more for a house/living situation
[8:07:09] spawnlife: ya wyrmwood slaps
[8:07:10] rahmakapala89: oh wow
[8:07:17] MARXIST__MAGGOT: :O :D
[8:07:26] ZHEJ: sheesh swifty could easily get a free table by sponsoring them LUL
[8:07:42] ZHEJ: promoting*
[8:08:01] Kaldeem: @Swifty Joe Manganiello had his build by Black Forest Wood Co they do some nice tables too.
[8:08:18] kirbz09: Rip
[8:08:35] vyssx: LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[8:08:50] omgherb: real wood
[8:09:01] PopeJonas: is it made out of mahogany
[8:09:09] LuhJiiT: that 150 dollar ikea desk is looking mighty fine right now
[8:09:12] dunknwow: Thats a car
[8:09:15] dunknwow: lol stop
[8:09:21] rahmakapala89: try red
[8:09:21] spawnlife: Hand made, real wood = hella expensive
[8:10:10] Kaldeem: go look at their other gaming tables
[8:10:15] Doopness: just get a card table and a set of figures
[8:10:17] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso go.corsair.com/XYOjza
[8:10:22] omgherb: your gonna have to hand make the dollar bills to pay for that
[8:10:33] EhBud: Just go to a woodworker show the design you want and have them remake ITIT will honestly cost you less than half of the cost of what these things are charging
[8:10:41] vyssx: home depot
[8:10:47] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:11:22] babayagah93: yeah if you want figures you have to look for them by themselfs. dwarfforge and drakenstone is a good place for modular terrain but most table will be by themselvs
[8:11:48] CB_Got_Games: I was just looking at that one lol
[8:11:58] furiousgrizz: Seems a lot more reasonable
[8:12:05] spawnlife: Think the main price of the 13g one was that hand crank raise and lower
[8:12:09] omgherb: yeah
[8:12:11] omgherb: its ok
[8:12:17] Bearman217: kinda like Wish
[8:12:19] Kaldeem: just depends on what your ording
[8:12:19] CB_Got_Games: my sons mario blanket when he was a baby was bought from etzy
[8:12:42] vicariann: you should be really safe with etsy.. Got friend who sells there and he had to do few refunds if any issues with the item
[8:12:46] Bearman217: 2am here
[8:12:50] vicariann: so seems fairly customer focused
[8:12:58] brickelrick1: goodnight swiftmaster
[8:12:58] furiousgrizz: good night
[8:13:00] Bearman217: night bud
[8:13:06] Kaldeem: bought splatoon 2 card things from there
[8:13:09] MeowsieTheDruid: nite nite!
[8:13:13] Spart4nm4n: cya swifty
[8:13:14] furiousgrizz: sorry Swifty lol
[8:13:16] WarIing: take care
[8:13:17] Juicewisdom: axeumSip
[8:13:21] Rockz_84: do a sponsor, done deal
[8:13:36] spawnlife: spawnl1Legionslide spawnl1Legionslide spawnl1Legionslide spawnl1Legionslide spawnl1Legionslide
[8:13:54] spawnlife: Trust look at the site more they got cheaper
[8:14:03] spawnlife: that large one was high end
[8:14:05] vicariann: You should be able to check reviews before purchase. Definitely avoid fresh sellers
[8:14:25] brickelrick1: peace
[8:14:27] omgherb: later swifty
[8:14:27] Bearman217: peace!
[8:14:27] Kaldeem: Peace!!!!!!!!
