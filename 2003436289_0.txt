[2:13:05] TrueBlue8: TwitchHub
[2:13:11] Nastharl: Definate L. Theres a ton of sites to go see porn if you wanna go see porn. Why does it need to be here also :(
[2:13:12] chill3willy: bout to have a bunch of cultured 13 year olds
[2:13:12] fattmab: immobile cocks only

[2:13:52] PaperbackWritter: money
[2:13:52] tO_Ot: shouldnt they blurr it or something
[2:14:00] Carlsbergs: Things would have been if I was the boss, that's for sure. but I can't blame them if it's within ToS
[2:14:04] uVeins: It's not just porn, they're creating it, thats the point. its great for learning and keeping that community together
[2:14:04] gooeythorns: not for advertisers
[2:14:10] xxhelljumper1xx: No no it is not
[2:14:12] Nightbot: Use this link to buy anything from Amazon to support Cobaltstreak -> https://tinyurl.com/cobaltamazon
[2:14:16] fattmab: they have to have the 18+ click through I suppose?
[2:14:30] maranon: @uveins cobaltSrs
[2:14:36] uVeins: eople who want to watch furry porn wont go look for it on twitch
[2:14:43] comic047: i like it
[2:14:43] Ap0c4lyptyc: There is so much porn online that can be accessed by anyone and everyone. If its here, meh who cares. Gives people a safe platform to secure the bag.
[2:14:44] Amuse654: Always skipped that
[2:14:46] Hellbear88: every item has its use
[2:14:48] Knightknine: I mean like you said more power to them for doing what they're allowed to do, but personally I kind of miss the days of twitch being more gaming oriented
[2:14:50] Left4Dead1971: now we can finally have lokor with a giant penis gachiBASS
[2:14:52] Sapphire_gpw: They said they aren‚Äôt allowing stuff like that on the homepage but it still shows up in recommended channels
[2:14:52] AlwaysComfy: It can be ok
[2:14:53] lord_settite: https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Updating-our-Approach-to-Sexual-Content-and-Content-Classification-Labels?language=en_US

[2:15:08] Luigge: well it's good for exploding stuff but yeah the my reflection makes it bad
[2:15:09] Hello_cakeguy: NSFW can't be recommended to you and and it won't show up on the front page EVER.
[2:15:12] fattmab: cock emote when?
[2:15:16] trevorsgame1: cobaltKamz
[2:15:20] Fanrogh: so if a stream is 18+ does teh thumbnail still show for ppl that arent 18+ ?
[2:15:22] uwuphoria: kamz about to draw lokor cocks POGGIES
[2:15:25] DrAtomicPanda: kamz bout to get an influx of viewers Keepo
[2:15:34] Nastharl: @CobaltStreak I guess where i'm at... If i ever wanted to browse twitch looking for good artists, i'm sure as hell not wading through 90 pounds of porn to find it. At least with just chatting/hottubs the only reason you'd go there is if you were explicitly looking for it.
[2:15:35] lnknprkbmb: @cobaltstreak all new meaning to ‚Äúdrop the lokor‚Äù

[2:16:54] gooeythorns: you cant even have a butt emote I dont think
[2:17:08] redgrimoire: maybe spike emote..
[2:17:18] nininhosam: since it's not for the artistic purpose like drawing, i don't know if you can
[2:17:48] rdg_99: COCKA cobaltLoKor

[2:19:15] manimac_: sorry !
[2:19:16] hatechatter: he means that you are all he needs
[2:19:22] preauxton: they'll never need to follow anyone ever again
[2:19:23] Jaded_S: most recent is the meaning of last there
[2:19:27] puddingprinceps: It's a riddle
[2:19:27] nininhosam: i mean is there a bad or good way? is there even a way to interpret that?
[2:19:29] Hellbear88: cobaltW jaeeCG2 jaeeCG3
[2:19:38] manimac_: YESSS .D
[2:19:53] lord_settite: Cobalt can play all the NSFW Steam games now on Twitch

[2:20:50] Nastharl: @CobaltStreak THey're hoping to get more sub money + bits. People donating for porn
[2:20:53] OverlordFuzz: i heard soda complimented you for that staff cobaltSup
[2:20:55] preauxton: next manscape sponsorship is going to go crazy
[2:20:57] Hellbear88: theres a fear and hunger 2... even more nfsw
[2:20:58] Radund01: Ads are not played on channels with those type of content so it does not affect the advertisers
[2:21:08] Fanrogh: i honestly think this is going to backfire at twitch but wtf do i know :P
[2:21:08] DrAtomicPanda: now you can play all the games on new and treading on steam Kappa
[2:21:15] Wafflum: Also F&H has mods to censor stuff
[2:21:19] Fanrogh: how much did you have to pay for it ?
[2:21:20] Ap0c4lyptyc: So if you want to kill ads on your channel you just draw D O N G all the time lol
[2:21:26] OverlordFuzz: sounds like me LMAO
[2:21:28] Sapphire_gpw: Wait, stick some googly eyes over the nips, that‚Äôs arts and crafts LUL
[2:21:32] Fanrogh: oh 4k not to bad
[2:21:34] stoney_entertainment: LUL
[2:21:37] 2005toyotacamryi4: for non wow players what does that shit do?
[2:21:46] Hellbear88: fear and hunger is a hard game
[2:21:48] preauxton: you dont wanna know
[2:21:54] Radund01: @Ap0c4lyptyc I think it has to be the main focus of the stream.
[2:21:58] OverlordFuzz: its just a cool staff
[2:22:02] PaperbackWritter: going for the last boss on ZG
[2:22:02] rdg_99: GIGACHAD
[2:22:04] OverlordFuzz: for mages
[2:22:07] Fanrogh: yeah i dont do the minbids on big items

[2:23:10] Ap0c4lyptyc: Kinda makes me wonder what that will actually do for advertising lol? And if advertisers will get pissed if they get ran on a stream with nothing but furry dong/vag @Radund01
[2:23:18] Fanrogh: no
[2:23:18] OverlordFuzz: i would consider coming back to WoW if it grows into like LK
[2:23:25] Fanrogh: it has 10 stam and ranged AP

[2:23:36] Alex_anitos: hello, youre my most watched streamer of this year, keep up the good work

[2:24:08] PaperbackWritter: GIGACHAD
[2:24:13] Bllominator: sup yall cobaltHi cobaltComfy
[2:24:14] Sapphire_gpw: cobaltHug
[2:24:26] Radund01: @Ap0c4lyptyc They will, but it will just result in harder policing.  Which means more job openings at Twitch.  As long as there is actions being done towards mis use of ToS the advertisers will be happy
