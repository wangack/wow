[3:12:22] ReduxDT: if you could keep high lvls from griefing it could bne
[3:12:30] AetherSinfire: I think there is a stipulation for pvp in HC, you can do the instances like WSG, but it doesn't count as a death for HC purposes
[3:12:33] ShiruShirudo: make the pvp Duel Style, 1 hp kneel and shit
[3:12:38] r41n_z: is shroud the one with blue hp ?

[3:14:42] Boblhead: lineage 2 had very good open pvp
[3:14:47] dnosu: That's what Ashes of Creation is doing though, with their anti-grief/corruption system

[3:14:54] AetherSinfire: osrs pvp? you lose gear
[3:14:57] rg_powerlue: Skull up
[3:14:59] Nexnation: they could also limit the amount of time you can be killed. For example any time you die from world pvp you can't be killed by another player for X amount of time
[3:14:59] dnosu: We'll see how it ends up working ultimately ofc
[3:15:04] HealthHzrd: Didnt archage have something like that?
[3:15:08] tykosensei: Open world initial combat results in a kneel. Cannot begin combat with that player again for X time or if a duel is accepted. thoughts????

[3:15:25] Avaerus0: You don't want the griefing to be so bad that it drives everyone else away.

[3:15:43] DatGuyFrank: Think the pvp fromula needed has changed over the years. i think vanilla pvp was perfect in 2005 :D

[3:16:01] mrrreed: hey dude
[3:16:01] AetherSinfire: OSRS you either gimp your own power so you don't lose anything and are easier to kill, or you risk most of your stuff
[3:16:09] HealthHzrd: I also didnt mind New Worlds system of optional flagging
[3:16:13] Csweatter: There was this old cyberpunk game I played with pvp and when you built up a bad enough reputation, you would go from dropping 1 or 2 items of insignificance at good to like all your best gear at bad rep
[3:16:15] Kajebabz: is it allowed for a duo too join dungeon groups on HC?

[3:41:09] AbendrothYolo: they made a poll in the wow forums about what activities people do, and classic hardcore was one of them, so it's at least acknowledged by blizzard
[3:41:15] Kabose28: Did there trio die?

[3:49:49] Complex_NA: @Dominicwinmill different items, different spells, different races, areas, etc.   classic is more about levelling and the journey  retail is more about end game and group content
[3:49:55] JerseyBricklayer: shroudGasm edge it
[3:49:57] hetsahk: classic = challenge... retail = watch youtube and push buttons

[3:51:13] KontrolStyle: classic
[3:51:18] DerangedDaedalus: @chandleriab it depends lol. Mecahnically it's harder, but for me, classic is hard because you need patience. I don't have that type of patience
[3:51:23] DethNade: level in classic is slow af
[3:51:37] DethNade: unless your a tank or healer
[3:51:42] Complex_NA: how come no one mentions that in retail you can just buy your way to max level anyways you just grind gear no levels

[5:26:12] ChubbyMikey: This is WoW Classic, with the Hardcore mod
[5:26:16] ChubbyMikey: *addon
[5:26:26] MyNameIsVortex: @MyNameIsVortex Don't think they're comparable
[5:26:41] 0Phantazy: Do you have to stay together at ALL times or could u split up to pick up quests?
[5:27:01] ThreeArcUnlock: @shroud what’s the last polish food that you ate?
[5:27:06] benderintime: @MyNameIsVortex the fastest xp way to skill in osrs is usually not efficient in terms of setting up your character for the long haul
[5:27:06] way_back: wait the mitch jones death was so funny
[5:27:15] hate_xyz: grey man servers are full right now SeemsGood
[5:27:17] ChubbyMikey: @POGNORWEGiAN to play Classic, you need to get the monthly WoW subscribtion. Classic is free after that. Retail requires paying a box price as well
[5:27:19] RyanMoment360: i miss this game 😭
[5:27:25] ChubbyMikey: Addons are (mostly) free
[5:27:28] HeIlraiser_: lol

[5:27:33] Nautt1: anyone remember wadu hek?
[5:27:38] 0Phantazy: I hit 60 on my war last night guzuYump
[5:27:38] HalfTrack_: You can 2h tank just about any dungeon you’re chillin
[5:27:40] V4LD5S: you are good. you are level 16
[5:27:43] ChubbyMikey: @maj0rnaut he was here yesterday
[5:27:45] MyNameIsVortex: @benderintime Nah because it's all GP, depending on the skill
[5:27:55] mamashade744: I used to play this game all the time Mickey
[5:27:57] Nautt1: @ChubbyMikey he was? Daaaamn good ol days
[5:27:59] anOceaninadrop: @pognorwegian search how to play wow classic era and visit classichc dot net if you want to play hardcore like shroud
[5:28:04] ChubbyMikey: TOLD YOU two servers would populate shroud
[5:28:15] RedwingXD: we on the way
[5:28:16] RyanMoment360: @maj0rnaut PUBG days 👀
[5:28:20] anOceaninadrop: @pognorwegian don't recommend Hardcore for a new player
[5:28:25] mamashade744: Okay red
[5:28:26] wColt: johnny is beefy as fuck anyways
[5:28:29] Dapqu: what server?
[5:28:32] wColt: we're gonna count for 7
[5:28:43] MyNameIsVortex: @maj0rnaut Yea, it's not even that long ago
[5:28:45] wingwong29: ooh fishing stream
[5:28:50] ChubbyMikey: !blamecolt
[5:28:50] Fossabot: @ChubbyMikey Is something in the Grey Man DayZ servers broken? Good news! Now, you can just #BlameColt
[5:28:57] Nautt1: @maj0rnaut pubg was long ago
[5:29:01] marioleyenda: where is your fishing hat @shroud
[5:29:12] wColt: @ChubbyMikey Stare
[5:29:14] benderintime: @MyNameIsVortex yes and all the efficient methods are gp sinks for smithing, mining, crafting, herb, wc
[5:29:16] Ogre_Flex: sorry for the dumb question but what lvl is he currently ? Im lost with this UI
[5:29:25] aerodynam1c: 16
[5:29:26] MyNameIsVortex: @MyNameIsVortex That's my point
[5:29:27] KontrolStyle: time to get to finishin'
[5:29:28] Sight__: did your trolls die>
[5:29:30] flashnickgg: this such good warm up for premier @shroud NODDERS

[5:29:33] 0Phantazy: Ye hardcore as a new player will be a long string countless deaths :D
[5:29:36] ChubbyMikey: Hey, I didn't make the rule. It is what it is. Always Blame Colt
[5:29:37] KontrolStyle: LULW
[5:29:40] bco71: @shroud do you think a character should be able to do all professions or be restrcited to 1?
[5:29:42] Ogre_Flex: @aerodynam1c ty
[5:29:45] ChubbyMikey: @POGNORWEGiAN yes
[5:29:52] shawskiii: @shroud are you not on bloodsail?
[5:29:54] anOceaninadrop: @pognorwegian there are two versions of classic, one classic era/vanilla which is the one shroud is in now and another with a later game version called wrath of the lich king
[5:29:55] 0Phantazy: 32 war :(
[5:30:04] Finaija: the felguard boss in RFC hits kinda hard, seen it almost kill tanks with a crit a lot of times on streams.
[5:30:15] ChubbyMikey: @shawskiii he is
[5:30:19] hate_xyz: they have to wait for J9 to finish his game with tiger woods Kappa
[5:30:25] Atavoid: NODDERS]
[5:30:27] Bronntoise: disagree tbh
[5:30:27] MyNameIsVortex: Huh
[5:30:30] MyNameIsVortex: Disagree imo
[5:30:35] aerodynam1c: i agree
[5:30:36] beef_flapper: new world is that way tho?? isnt it
[5:30:38] theonlyweba: Yo bro u need security or ghost ryder
[5:30:39] kurib: remember guys, different people different opinion
[5:30:39] Wrosperite: Agreege
[5:30:47] ixpokerxi: Anyone trying to party up for hardcore? I can run priest
[5:30:52] MrGloomz: I hate that shit in FFXIV, trying to level a new class after hitting cap is just RIP
[5:30:55] BTiZZY_: better watch out the FF fam is gonna come for you lol @shroud
[5:30:57] Marz311: nah
[5:30:59] theonlyweba: How r u shroud
[5:31:01] Atavoid: each person brings something special
[5:31:01] KSarv: hard disagree. I really enjoy leveling up each class
[5:31:02] konubee: Agreege it’s an mmo not a single player so classes should be that way
[5:31:04] anOceaninadrop: @pognorwegian it does, just dm me any question you have I'm willing to help a new player
[5:31:04] slipqnot11: nah
[5:31:08] ThatGirthyGuy: @shroud did your trio die? sorry wasn't here
[5:31:09] beef_flapper: although i like New world, just similar system
[5:31:09] VOIID_GG: ESO was my fav pvp wise as well
[5:31:12] Atavoid: slippery
[5:31:13] Draetus102: rogue healers seem dumb to me
[5:31:14] HalfTrack_: Ya FF characters kinda lack identity
[5:31:15] ChubbyMikey: I like how New World does it
[5:31:15] xSIMTUMx: OSRS
[5:31:18] Nightspectr: yeah attack weaving feels clunky
[5:31:19] MyNameIsVortex: FFXIV works the same way though. You can equip same type of armour/weapon on multiple classes
[5:31:20] bco71: @shroud I hate how FFXIV restricted your weapons to the class
[5:31:23] Wrosperite: FF is a meme
[5:31:28] Rezzlyn: this char is almost the same lvl as your troll. lol lvling pretty quickly on this char
[5:31:30] viber4: FF combat/animation feels too empty
[5:31:32] finger2face: its ugly
[5:31:37] realxguardian: u like guild wars?
[5:31:37] Polarmensch: dude the game is from 2004
[5:31:38] MyNameIsVortex: The animations are delayed, that's why
[5:31:38] Protomateria: combat feels good, its just very slow compared to wow
[5:31:39] beef_flapper: ya new world makes it work somehow idk, i agree
[5:31:40] CaddySlash: I've never been able to commit to a character like I have in FFXIV. Being able to switch classes is a v big W for me
[5:31:44] MyNameIsVortex: @Polarmensch So is WoW
[5:31:45] brodycanuck: ESOs animations are fairly bad
[5:31:50] konubee: FF feels very empty honestly
[5:31:58] benderintime: ff gameplay is awful until you unlock a lot of off-gcd buttons
[5:31:58] Clivelando: just finished my 4h TESO session
[5:31:58] KontrolStyle: lol we can tell
[5:32:02] ThatGirthyGuy: I just want a mmo with the same movement as wow
[5:32:06] Atavoid: animations matter
[5:32:17] brodycanuck: It doesnt look cool...it looks fairly derpy
[5:32:21] wannaodin: yes
[5:32:22] ThatGirthyGuy: animations can change for the better
[5:32:23] WantedDNT: gw2 best animations
[5:32:23] aerodynam1c: its still completely insane how good the animations of classic are for 2004
[5:32:24] wannaodin: i agree tho
[5:32:25] ChubbyMikey: to meESO feels ALMOST great, but I can't ever pinpoint what is missing
[5:32:25] MyNameIsVortex: Animation is important
[5:32:26] yeahbestrafmich: u have to feed the pigeons around for more fishing skills
[5:32:28] AbendrothYolo: taeko22 even at peak, Guild Wars felt empty because the whole world was instanced, if I remember correctly
[5:32:29] Busdieker: no mmo has ever made the free flowing movement as wow
[5:32:31] Protomateria: nah, animations are a really big deal imo
[5:32:31] geeriffy: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TRIO DID THEY DIE?
[5:32:33] wannaodin: stiff
[5:32:37] Lukxus: Lukxus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 1 Year!!
[5:32:40] Ogre_Flex: YEP agreed
[5:32:41] ChubbyMikey: j9 isn't playing today. these are the duo toons they made before the toons they played on with j9
[5:32:43] Insanenoizes: Pressing a button in every blizzard game feels great!
[5:32:45] s3xybrioche: @geeriffy yes
[5:32:45] Nautt1: they nailed undead animations specially with casters
[5:32:46] MyNameIsVortex: @Busdieker BDO has but everything else just isn't good
[5:32:48] Protomateria: animations can make or break a game
[5:32:48] me_alone_ramp: I like TESO way More
[5:32:53] Tobssessxic: FeelsStrongMan
[5:32:55] AbendrothYolo: @geeriffy they need the whole trio online in order to play
[5:33:00] wannaodin: wtimeless
[5:33:03] Jericho85: GW 2 have best mount animations
[5:33:07] MyDarkX: also it probably has the best most responsive network code out of all mmos
[5:33:10] AlexIsAKnight: @shroud have you ever given Guild Wars 2 a shot?
[5:33:11] NILLme: timeless art style
[5:33:12] klipklep: @shroud premier at 11 pm pst are u playing?
[5:33:18] neildeg: gonna get back to destiny 2 ever? @shroud
[5:33:18] TheOfficialGameChannel: if you didn't have to weave light attacks in eso, it'd be more enjoyable
[5:33:22] Keeiko7: I feel the same in ESO, It just felt "dull" after some days of gaming. Sad to say cause it's such a nice world
[5:33:24] Gummybunnn: its cause the fishing levl is higer in org
[5:33:24] waelrick: wow has the benefit of being cartoonish, ages better than going realistic
[5:33:28] dejanmustard: what does fishing give you
[5:33:29] KontrolStyle: bobber?
[5:33:29] frostone1: @shroud u can click by sound
[5:33:32] snowfly69: Dude even 1st year wow is better than any MMO that ever has been created so smooth so flawless its impossible to beat

[5:33:36] gigglybit77: need a lure
[5:33:41] dejanmustard: @Ayomeer  but why lol
[5:33:43] Protomateria: @MyDarkX yeah, its crazy to me how wow is still the most responsive MMO 20 years later
[5:33:45] viber4: @shroud fish are shoulder peaking
[5:33:46] MyNameIsVortex: @MyDarkX The only reason you think that is because the animation gets canceled once you use a different skill
[5:33:54] klipklep: @mods is he playing premier valo at 11pm?

[6:18:28] kahrazy: combat from his bloodrage
[6:18:30] tinksc: @carelone HC mode is one life. If you die you delete. You can do each dungeon once only.
[6:18:30] Aluru1: @troyjan_ there are some rules also, like no AH or mailbox or trading except if its ur duo/trio

[6:19:30] kingmoul: are you allowed to run dungeons more than once?
[6:19:41] Krisen89: No
[6:19:46] Aluru1: @Carelone you can if you want, then its not HC anymore
[6:19:49] tinksc: @carelone sure. But your run won't be recognised as HC. You use an add-on that keeps track of your in game logs. Then verify at 60
[6:19:56] BigHijinks: ohh shit
[6:20:01] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[6:20:11] TheOfficialGameChannel: nice tall glass of chocolate milk
[6:20:13] tinksc: If you break the rules, the add-on knows. And your run won't be verified. Essentially wasting your time attempting HC

[6:21:31] unstablegt: Are you gonna play Premier later?
[6:21:32] tinksc: @carelone NA is bloodsail buccaneers server, EU is hydraxian waterlords. If you Google wow HC you'll see everything you wanna know on their site
[6:21:43] goblinjerkey23: shroud healing is stressing me out
[6:21:49] Carelone: @tinksc ty
[6:21:58] tinksc: @carelone dungeons only once. I think raids at 60 you can do more than once, but if you die you still gotta delete
[6:22:04] HydrozOG: why is the mage not sheeping one tough lol
[6:22:09] anOceaninadrop: @carelone at 60 you can do dungeons how much you want, their site is classichc dot net
[6:22:13] Atavoid: don't fall in lava Prayge
[6:22:27] Bronntoise: i guess the ultimate goal is to have a team of 40 HCs clear AQ

[6:23:10] TM_Kyle: What's up with the 3 other people, this ain't a duo
[6:23:22] Bronntoise: @TM_Kyle it's a dungeon bucko

[6:56:56] mob_duvi: you divert too much i
[6:56:57] fadegurei: but you will fall behind in gear no?
[6:56:57] mamashade744: Hi krait how are you
[6:56:58] StarlightNebula_: Only problem then is that you'll be lacking in gear
[6:56:59] Bronntoise: dungeons take too much time to do everything
[6:57:00] accordinoj: @shroud sup shroud, i got banned from @Trey24k yesterday for making an Anne Frank comment that apparently ''wasn't funny'' #1984
[6:57:02] Bronntoise: better to just stay questing
[6:57:03] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[6:57:09] StarlightNebula_: But if you can manage the quests efficiently, it works out pretty well
[6:57:10] chrundlestoeknife: Advice for someone just starting WoW?
[6:57:13] Specuh: questing is better, too many variables in dungeons
[6:57:14] fadegurei: you'll die without the dungeon gear
[6:57:16] RapsterDJ: uc weapon master as well
[6:57:16] Decessuss: lacking in gear.... Ironman challenge lol

[6:57:35] stalemate_595: Its assuming the goal is to be the fastest tho...
[6:57:38] ummish: 30+ the XP fills in levels nicely
[6:57:44] fbi_dragon: getting blues in vanilla so fun
[6:57:44] cromez16: Solo player more risk leveling in stonetalon than doing wailing caverns with 6 dung quests
[6:57:48] Bronntoise: @gibson6886 same honestly. i leveled 3 chars in classic from 1-60 without dungeons
[6:57:49] Rasulki: @gibson6886 Normal classic you just spam SM 27-45
[6:57:49] MastaChiefa_: i only do it for the loot

[6:58:07] NoMoreSadness: fun? HYPERDANSGAMEW
[6:58:10] retau_: I went dungeonless and my weapons were on par with the SM blues when i hit 60, it's rough
[6:58:11] blomsteryo: @shroud doing dungeons is going faster in the long run cuz u get better gear from it than questing  wich makes everything faster in the long run
[6:58:12] immakky: it's very too to fill some gaps where questing slows down at higher levels
[6:58:22] delici0usz: weapon makes a huge difference on warrior

[7:20:39] MetalMilitia74: stop jumping ffs
[7:20:41] davicous1: rebirth useless, paladin super OP with bub
[7:20:42] brodycanuck: I dont think it will...there wont be high level non HC people to grief, and they are perma banning griefers
[7:20:46] ironalencia: i hope blizzard adds rules to combat grief or else hc would be doa
[7:20:49] Protomateria: @Quova supposedly blizz is announcing it on the 13th
[7:20:51] kjers: blizzard wont review and correct grief deaths
[7:20:53] KoalaTheAwesome: imagine $20 to reset death counter on official HC xd
[7:20:53] KillaCamJam: @metalmilitia74 BibleThump
[7:20:56] ares710: I think season of mastery 2 will be more hype than Hardcore IMO if they do it right
[7:20:58] Quova: Oh okay, thanks guys!
[7:21:34] ironalencia: @ares710 they need to just reset the classic era servers and help the bad classes(ret/ele/spriest) then it would be good
[7:21:53] Slayforpay: since when is this a no cursing chat, did not realize that

[7:22:31] theflyhamster: who wants a leveling simulator lol
[7:22:36] BCboy_: FeelsOkayMan TeaTime
[7:22:36] Swishzors: I feel like HC raiding would be impossible because progression wouldn't be a thing.
[7:22:38] v2Occy: raiding hardcore sounds terrible lol
[7:22:43] TheLightSilent: we hope they dont monetize it hc
[7:22:44] davicous1: lmao end gaming raiding no deaths sounds kinda silly. Since loot is bop lol
[7:22:47] Zardaa: so retail hc
[7:22:48] Jstocks: so like reduce xp requirement to hit 60?
[7:22:53] Stanlec: @Swishzors hardcore raiding is a thing already

[7:23:23] o_oKurisu: what game is he talking about?
[7:23:23] Stanlec: @Swishzors it is on a real server KEKW
[7:23:25] BigUnknownGamer: so just start at lvl 60 in hc?
[7:23:26] ares710: They also need to allow players to transfer to ERA and or automatically go to TBC after the 6 month cycle or whatever it is
[7:23:26] trillollie: ahh
[7:23:29] trillollie: thanks
[7:23:30] davicous1: sure no deaths in this raid.. vs level back to 60 and get your gear to run up to tier 5 lol
[7:23:35] Stanlec: @Swishzors same server shroud is playing
[7:23:41] Xearu: Classic servers are fake apparently
[7:23:48] HalfTrack_: i feel like thats kinda how retail HC would be no? leveling is ez in retail with the risk and difficulty being end game
[7:23:50] MuscleCow: You have to delete all your gear and start over at 60 as naked when you die
[7:23:52] xzrudy: rapido?
[7:24:06] davicous1: is this pve? no battlegrounds?
[7:24:41] Trillvilll: there should be a mode where you can play hardcore but sell on the ah. shouldn’t be hardcore and hard rules
[7:25:01] NeroSvx: premier?
[7:25:07] HalfTrack_: im glad you were there for the shaman tank dream to live. they werent trusting me to do it
[7:25:07] ironalencia: @Trillvilll that can work on a fresh server with only hardcores
[7:25:13] MetalMilitia74: @Trillvilll that would be ez mode
[7:25:25] onslaughtak: way to much going on
[7:25:28] petrosgambit: retail hc sucks, leveling is ass
[7:25:31] frozenIRL: lmao you cant do that
[7:25:34] MrGloomz: tru
[7:25:34] Dherjee: you can do m+, not mythic raid tho
[7:25:38] StandinVice: not doable
[7:25:38] kjers: you would only die in raid m+15
[7:25:38] Bobb_EH: the does not sound fun at all for retail harcore
[7:25:42] TheLightSilent: retail sucks
[7:25:42] Trillvilll: ez mode how lol it’s still hard af not dying to 60
[7:25:42] ExcapePlan: what is the HC server again?
[7:25:43] iMStincky: Is there live HC server in EU yet?
[7:25:44] snabobo: retail is way too hard for the playerbase.

[7:26:02] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[7:26:06] XshadowturkeyX: people do ironmoan with only grey / white items and no talents 0 grping and need a 95% killing blow on mobs
[7:26:06] 0liquid: Did the trio die?
[7:26:06] blowupmymind12: i almost feel like adding extra rules would break the current 'vibe' of hardcore @shroud
[7:26:09] Haywire_GG: I just hope they do some class changes to make some specs viable that are not rn
[7:26:09] dedrateroserasdom: retail is not an enjoyable game, easy as that
[7:26:10] Kryten319: I mean you just like CC and methodic dungeons which is fine
[7:26:12] MetalMilitia74: @Trillvilll very ez if you can buy gear and not earn it
[7:26:17] timmon_: @ExcapePlan bloodsale buccaneer or something like that for u
[7:26:17] CrazyKrugs: @ExcapePlan bloodsai buccaneers
[7:26:18] timmon_: us*
[7:26:24] ExcapePlan: thank you :)
[7:26:27] Vouz_: dont click the discord link above, it's a scam
[7:26:28] Kryten319: I enjoy the fast pace and quick decision making of the M+ system
[7:26:30] dimeclown: @dedrateroserasdom delusional
[7:26:33] Zardaa: so you are asking for wotlk hc
[7:26:35] Kryten319: and raids are really the same...
[7:26:39] Ojaayy: What happened to the trio? did he die?
[7:26:44] Trillvilll: you still have to go thru to 60 not dying who cares what gear u have if you have 10 mobs in u
[7:26:49] lospokes: !rip
[7:26:51] scrubknightx: let me test your seed
[7:27:08] Kryten319: so my question is why do you hate the current raid system?
[7:27:15] Kryten319: if M+ isnt for you thats fine
[7:27:20] Permafro: What addon is the quest one you are using?
[7:27:25] MetalMilitia74: @Trillvilll gear makes a huge difference
[7:27:35] dedrateroserasdom: asmon has the real take, nobody cares raiding, its M+ simulator, you can do the same things in diablo
[7:27:36] frozenIRL: yep its gonna be a shitshow
[7:27:41] brodycanuck: I dont think it will be very griefed. Blizzard is perma banning accounts for griefing in HC
[7:27:43] EasyPeasley: Bold of you to assume their 10 man classic dev team can handle phase 3 wotlk and also hardcore servers KEKW
[7:27:48] RichardSunS: Is trio still alive chat?? Loop me in please
[7:27:54] Trillvilll: ok but not at 60 that’s where the game starts who cares how you get there
[7:27:55] SpaceVoyage: @Permafro RestedXP
[7:27:58] davicous1: haha same for the fiery enchant lol
[7:27:58] purplestone90: @shroud how would it be griefed when everyone is HC?
[7:28:02] frozenIRL: @brodycanuck Kapp
[7:28:03] Permafro: Ty
[7:28:05] cheft831: yo chat what addon is making his minimap look like that??
[7:28:05] EdLok_: They don't have ressouces to "appeal" stuff if the server get DDOS'd and 6 guilds wipe @shroud
[7:28:07] KeasyKey: they were speaking about the griefing and how to minimize it
[7:28:08] kosmos_qc: the trio question every 2 min NotLikeThis
[7:28:08] petrosgambit: eh.. make teremus reset, fix a few bugs and griefing will be difficult
[7:28:15] rippy15: is that because of tauren or using a 2h?
[7:28:22] iMStincky: Is HC live on EU?
[7:28:23] EdLok_: They don't have ressouces to "appeal" stuff if the server get DDOS'd and 6 guilds wipe @shroud 󠀀
[7:28:38] oldgoont: no appeals too
[7:28:51] ItsDiegoBoi: you should try warrior
[7:28:56] davicous1: how does BWL Vael work?
[7:28:58] Nightspectr: you don't see osrs players tryuing to appeal DC's
[7:28:59] Experiia: @iMStincky Yea its on Hydraxian water lords

[7:29:30] DadBodHotRod: LF1 TANK HC DM
[7:29:34] NoMoreSadness: doesnt it lead to a WC quest
[7:29:48] slowjohnson: There is no chance blizzard will do appeals
[7:29:52] thevelblade: !rip
[7:29:56] thevelblade: !death
[7:29:57] iMStincky: @iMStincky It's a RP server right? It's not official HC  right?
[7:30:03] PinkTaricFTW: wait...wasn't @shroud a troll? Is it dead?
[7:30:05] Taylgator: what are the crazy ways you can get griefed? isnt it mostly dragging certain mobs to low areas, they could probably just make those mobs fixed to their respective zones
[7:30:06] cbars_i: exactly bro
[7:30:08] cbars_i: its over
[7:30:10] GatorGangTV: if its a connection issue on blizzards end they may consider rollbacks but never appeal individuals for their dcs
[7:30:10] MetalMilitia74: should have to play hc with no addons also tbh
[7:30:10] BeardedMiniBoss: tickets already take long enough. Can't imagine what would happen if HC came into the picture.
[7:30:26] cbars_i: there will no be appeals
[7:30:26] hate_xyz: or if there's a storm and your connection goes out lol
[7:30:28] vacui_dev: not "every time", just the one time before your character is deleted KappaHD
[7:30:29] mhmsamuel: !premier

[7:30:45] MuscleCow: oof lvl 55 RIP
[7:30:46] ye1l: its gonna be way more hype though and have more players
[7:30:50] ironalencia: i just want fresh vanilla tbh
[7:30:53] TheLightSilent: or every time you get DC from game cause trash servers LUL
[7:30:54] Puckyu: No shot a lvl 55 died
[7:30:56] dedrateroserasdom: they will have a even easier HC anyway because the limitation of parties and auctions lifted
[7:31:00] Soarlozer: there isnt appeals for diablo hc why the hell would there be for wow.
[7:31:02] Puckyu: Puckyu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[7:31:05] EdLok_: Blizzard has been cutting down on GM for the past 10 years. It tooks 4 days to talk to one in Wotlk release
[7:31:08] deneking: !premiere
[7:31:10] XshadowturkeyX: i heard recently the discord started only accpeting videos for death appeals, to manyh people at low lvl with only screenshots
[7:31:16] slowjohnson: @soarlozer way easier to grief in wow
[7:31:26] Harriblu: Are you playing premiers today father shroud
[7:31:28] xglacier07: is shroud playing premiere?
[7:31:35] brodycanuck: Its hard for people to grief if theyre not a high level other than flagging people to PVP...although blizzard could make that impossible if they wanted to, and it would take too long to level up just to grief someone and then get permabanned
[7:31:36] Puckyu: Shwowdy
[7:31:45] x3alone: shroudy roudyyyy

[7:31:53] juustboi: You’ve got a premier match dawg
[7:31:55] EdLok_: Imagine an appeal with like 4 GMs for every servers. It wont happen. It wont be fun.
[7:32:09] 204Justin: Hello
[7:32:21] Puckyu: Howdy
[7:32:23] ironalencia: @brodycanuck there used to be a horde hunter that camped southshore back in classic 24/7 you have no idea what people are like when they have no jobs
[7:32:25] grenxnja: shroodle
[7:32:43] grenxnja: tommy waiting for ya
[7:32:48] DirtyDazzo: why flametonguie over rockbiter shroud?
[7:32:57] brodycanuck: @brodycanuck HC servers are on Non-PVP servers though, and if blizzard made it 100% impossible to flag for PVP in HC then it wouldnt matter
[7:33:03] EdLok_: I actually think Blizzard won't even pull HC Server at all.
[7:33:03] Prolix32: !deaths
[7:33:03] Iron_Pipe: I think the current HC setup is too antisocial and actually deters new players. Should be HC and then HC Ironman options.
[7:33:19] BigBusiness: @shroud Did you have the payed version?
[7:33:32] v2Occy: 1-22 is good. after that, the free version, its starts to lack
[7:33:39] BigBusiness: is it safe to purchase?
[7:33:42] timmon_: its also nice for just Brainafk leveling. dont need to think where to go n shit
[7:33:43] Gen1us_Fps: how much is this?
[7:33:43] ironalencia: @brodycanuck we are talking about griefing i can find someone who will find some way to leash a dragon into goldshire just to mess with people
[7:33:49] Gradyolson1: rested xp is ez mode for questing
[7:33:58] Pottomzola: did justin die, or they're duoing because he's busy?
[7:33:58] ye1l: I leveled 60 enough times to have restedexp in my brain basically
[7:33:59] enyogaming_: rested only
[7:34:02] HalfTrack_: it looks like it follows the standard speed running route with a couple small tweaks, taking out dangerous stuff and intentionally killing yourself to gy res and such.
[7:34:02] grenxnja: WoW
[7:34:04] razorvs: ScaredyCat

[7:34:23] RAZ_is_here_to_Hula: Mankriks wife Sadge
[7:34:28] brodycanuck: @brodycanuck And if they do that they will get permabanned, so thats a lot of work to level up just to grief a few people and then get permabanned and have to re-pay for the game and do all that leveling again just to grief a couple people
[7:34:47] Wonkabomb: 25
[7:34:53] bryy_tv: did I miss just9n dying?
[7:34:54] ironalencia: @brodycanuck unless they are IP banning them you just make more and more alts just to mess with people dont underestimate
[7:34:59] KeasyKey: they are elites
[7:35:00] oldgoont: rares
[7:35:02] bloodborne60fpsplz: No one cares about valorant

[7:35:14] bloodborne60fpsplz: Followed by csgo
[7:35:17] Squee311: the allaince pat? it drops a quests
[7:35:27] brodycanuck: @brodycanuck The amount of time and effort that would take just to grief a couple people that are lower level than them wouldn't be worth it, and would be a lot less common
[7:35:57] slowjohnson: But the grieving would still happen? @brodycanuck
[7:36:01] bloodborne60fpsplz: Who slays more P u ssy shroud, alliance or horde

[7:36:28] brodycanuck: @slowjohnson at a very insignificant amount
[7:36:41] HalfTrack_: he said tiny tooltip banger addon
[7:36:42] devicito0: @FilthyRawe hardcore, death=delete
[7:36:50] slowjohnson: Right so it would still exist
[7:36:57] slowjohnson: Without an appeal process
[7:37:08] Kob1n24: when i died my name didnt show up on the death log

[7:37:14] scrappywolf316: so when do we get to do the drop for the mount
[7:37:15] anirudra_basnet: is cussing allowed?
[7:37:16] brodycanuck: @brodycanuck You underestimate how much effort it would take to level up just to screw over a couple people that are lower level, they would be griefing them selves more than the people theyre doing it to
