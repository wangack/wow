[0:51:10] rustyjeep: i'm still leveling and glad i didnt rush like the streamers did
[0:51:12] palac105: im a man with a life, this is perfect for me
[0:51:14] infom0rph: raid logging and happy with that
[0:51:16] Lunights: negative stam on caster gear is a wild choice
[0:51:17] scinvictus: i really wanted to get into it and im usually an altoholic but i havent played since halfway through phase 1
[0:51:17] ThisGuyisLocal: thoughts on buffing the sleeping bag bonus?
[0:51:18] reefo: @PatchesMcPatch i agree with this too
[0:51:26] TheEndIsNear777: they need to focus on making tons more quests, chain quests, world quests, mini world bosses that drop epic/blues, 20 more dungeons and 5 more raids :)
[0:51:27] 2hi2function: not even that, doing the rep gains again is my issue with doing an alt
[0:51:29] summerteeth: unless you like grinding dungeons, not a whole lot to do unfort
[0:51:41] lerler: the problem is that the barrier of entry is high AF atm
[0:51:42] daycaredaddy: I feel like this is designed for regular people with jobs. streamers will crush this content. content creation will be tough for sod?
[0:51:44] lerler: too much gold
[0:51:48] LiquidGrizz: revered with box rep?
[0:52:06] SageOfSwords: SM RAID WOULD BE WILD
[0:52:26] ReconMazihoFanda: probably not
[0:52:28] straff_dis: @SageOfSwords theyll def do that for the 60 bracket
[0:52:37] ReconMazihoFanda: already cleared this map a hundred times while leveling
[0:52:39] straff_dis: already has been teased
[0:52:42] rlenk: Harold
[0:52:49] SageOfSwords: SM just gives me the right amount of nostalgia
[0:53:03] Potato_Chaps: @rlenk holy shit is that rlenk?
[0:53:07] spookystylo: i dont understand, where is he getting this information about the map layout of a theoretical sm
[0:53:11] summerteeth: bad KEKW

[0:53:12] 2hi2function: ya kinda boring and tight
[0:53:14] mrmangasm: kinda small
[0:53:15] valentinooo: same exact rooms lmao
[0:53:15] AmarokUnchained: scarlet bastion
[0:53:16] Spanos_: or 20
[0:53:18] LiquidGrizz: agreed
[0:53:20] proxa92: it could be trash mobs there dude
[0:53:23] Mawshaw: Small corridors with a raid NOPERS
[0:53:23] LiquidGrizz: that
[0:53:25] Herrrman3: They need to use Ty'rs Hand
[0:53:27] straff_dis: It needs to be a brand new experience. Have us fight the demon imposter dude. forgot his name as the final raid boss
[0:53:31] Soupwtf: WE DID THIS SHIT ALREADY!
[0:53:32] wihahz: dont make me go back
[0:53:36] reefo: it will no way be SM
[0:53:38] summerteeth: if they reuse everything i'm gonna be pissed

[0:53:43] ZirrTV: every now and then when I get a in game whisper my game freezes, any help ?
[0:53:47] LiquidGrizz: outdoor area yea
[0:53:49] AmarokUnchained: tyrs hand cathedral POGGERS
[0:53:51] mrmangasm: maybe thats an endgame raid
[0:53:55] Potato_Chaps: @spookystylo he opened the map likely on a pserver and explored it
[0:53:55] dabby2121: i think the new raid is gonna be sunken temple, they already have class trinkets coming from it and i can see them buffing it
[0:54:19] reefo: @ZirrTV could be addon, i would disable everything and see if it fixes it, then slowly add addons until it happens again
[0:54:26] cloudstrife543: i think they made this, then changed it to 4 instances instead
[0:54:27] infom0rph: tyr's hand would be better, hearthglen not that good
[0:54:31] savotage_90: servers up

[0:58:45] 555artur: the 2 portals behind bars in Stormwind are such a nobrainer
[0:58:47] summerteeth: i fuck with the emerald dream
[0:58:48] lizcat_: it’s my favorite part of lore
[0:58:55] rlenk: @LiquidGrizz yeah grim batol is good example of a different prison instance, and i thought that one was/is fun
[0:59:03] indolent_sloth: looks like the goo in the undercity
[0:59:03] big_nizzo: I wouldnt mind emerald dream or hyjal revamp, because they can do it right
[0:59:06] kelvystorm: this looks like outland
[0:59:11] SageOfSwords: bro please make this place

[1:00:21] Link9286: 100% it's lack of resources
[1:00:33] rlenk: something with the dragons of nightmare portals would be kool
[1:00:37] lizcat_: kara crypts is such an obvious choice

[1:00:45] Genghish: For the right price i'd make it how hard can it be?
[1:00:48] darko367: could tthey pottentially add quests and stuff tto prreexistting zones? @StaysafeTV
[1:00:49] LiquidGrizz: a cramped dark crypt
[1:00:54] Kopro_II: They get millions per month, but they just don't have the resources to invest into their game, such a shame..

[1:07:35] Area51Labs: what are the shoulders?

[1:07:39] PhokingTV_: KEKW
[1:07:42] Shredmuffn: mount hijal but they just log you into cata KEKw
[1:07:50] infom0rph: not enough time between phases for them to dev new zones

[1:08:36] doctorjoker12: level 60 token @StaysafeTV
[1:08:45] Ziwax: exp token maybe
[1:08:50] keasbeynights: characters also had 50% xp leveling buff, would be unfair to allow ppl to transfer them to era
[1:09:02] latenightsuckmeright: @keasbeynights ahaha
[1:09:17] Shredmuffn: Mount Hyjal is literally FireLands, so funny people ask for it in SoD and hate cata

[1:09:35] infom0rph: fuck hyjal tbh
[1:09:40] PhokingTV_: Cata feral druid PogU

[1:10:36] doctorjoker12: exchange your SOD 60 for 60 token on use cata or era
[1:10:52] thenagdaddy: SOD is driving subs. Microsoft speaks money. keep that up and we’ll get more
[1:10:56] rlenk: I'd like to see SoD evolve into what OSRS does and community vote to get things added/stay the same.
[1:11:01] Bloodraven2488: If cate. Flops they will make new sod stuff
[1:11:04] ReconMazihoFanda: i think they fd up sod a bit by adding too much abilities, classes r too op default vanilla content is obsolete
[1:11:11] rlenk: Build around the mechanics of classic
[1:11:14] Goonzie99: MLADY
[1:11:20] infom0rph: i think they will only have time to dev new raids at 60, the phases are too short
[1:11:24] 555artur: @Goonzie99 MLADY ffzX
[1:11:24] Link9286: SOM was too early, people were burned from classic
[1:11:28] Nerdworker: especially considering the ONLY money they make form SoD is sub money. Versus all the cash shop bs they can profit off of in other versions of the game

[1:12:31] reefo: i really dont care about the shop, doesn't change the game at all
[1:12:37] cloudstrife543: cosmetics ruin the game
[1:12:39] PhokingTV_: u wanna have blue floating wings go head

[1:13:04] cloudstrife543: jsut make a goodgame, you dont need cosmetisc
[1:13:08] PhokingTV_: just sell every tier set in a red color and purple color thats atleast 2 million
[1:13:10] Nerdworker: Or level boosts obviously.
[1:13:10] PhokingTV_: in revenue
[1:13:19] Voidbonx: hope the runes come again in the next season theme
[1:13:25] darko367: i would love tto see what tthey would do with adding new mobs and quests and sttuff to preexistting zones why not add some jump puzzles and cllue quests and shhit
[1:13:27] Kawatteruwow: They should sell battle pass instead for the new raids in classic+. new cosmetics will turn classic into retail
[1:13:34] arran564: True
[1:13:37] doctorjoker12: USA
[1:13:39] RockonBrother88: separate subs to classic/retail
[1:13:42] PhokingTV_: i dont even care about wow tokens
[1:13:43] Link9286: true
[1:13:44] Voidbonx: true
[1:13:46] PhokingTV_: aslong as gdkp is banned
[1:13:51] Voidbonx: nowadays it's just like that
[1:13:52] twenty1au: I already think the metamorph model is way out of place in vanilla

[2:34:21] wramel: i just have 2 sets of weps

[2:36:21] Mawshaw: Some of them are just too expensive, 10g+ it feels like such a waste
[2:36:23] plddn: lol i throw them away cus they never give me the first aid or leather
[2:36:42] StaysafeTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59eZUvp4VJU
[2:36:43] Raisenette: why did they stop letting you turn in uncompleted boxes?
[2:37:03] hansger: 12 elixir of agi for one, so yea, around 10g just to get a filled one, since you can't turn in unfilled ones anymore.  Waste of time and gold
[2:37:28] Daracus98: gnomer
[2:37:29] arran564: Uldaman

[2:40:53] Cezarcez: @fietsopa4 they are not that op
[2:40:57] Mansford: what runes are you running for this?
[2:41:02] spyd3r0: what are you farming for?
[2:41:03] EmanuShow: Any good addons for runes and so on in SoD?
[2:41:07] kheeefy: staysafe in the am?!
[2:41:17] arran564: its worth it
[2:41:21] negativepinktv: negativepinktv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 12 month streak! sup my dude
[2:41:29] StoneyYeti: is the use on the pact trinket worth it?
[2:41:31] crouder: 6pm here
[2:41:33] leroylol: hell yea
[2:41:34] Bronloch: Classic Handynotes @EmanuShow

[2:41:45] Rofak5: yeah its great i can watch at work
[2:41:46] srrycon: do you think we will get a BRD raid in SoD? it is by far my favorite dungeon @StaysafeTV
[2:41:49] boxhead66: @EmanuShow Questie shows you were all the runes are
[2:41:55] Zitrux: need some coffe for that one
[2:42:02] boxhead66: where*
[2:42:05] crouder: pleas no brd
[2:42:07] crouder: lets do mara
[2:42:08] killthnrun: BRD IS AIDSS!
[2:42:08] Deadmagictv: ST next raid for sure
[2:42:09] Mahca_: brd is epic as a 5 man
[2:42:09] RudyRube: @StaysafeTV brd STYLE raid behind the doors in BRD would be pog
[2:42:13] tecncaldificltes: i think it will be mara
[2:42:15] R3ga1: inb4 sunken temple
[2:42:19] r0xorzb0xorz: I think they should add improved loot to BRD
[2:42:19] srrycon: ahh
[2:42:20] straff_dis: let ironfoe drop more often okay
[2:42:20] Deomas11: Not another BRD, but another Blackrock raid would be cool
[2:42:20] crouder: fuck st
[2:42:27] Oreo_Swagwagon: ST next
[2:42:27] scinvictus: ST?
[2:42:28] MawblesPDX: TEMPLE IT IS
[2:42:30] desweck: i love gnomer
[2:42:30] arran564: Sunken Temple
[2:42:32] kefaloni4: they should turn ST into raid and redeem it
[2:42:34] desweck: and i love st
[2:42:34] Highmen3: But what if they add another raid instance at the back of BRD and make that the raid?
[2:42:35] zachh_93: ST
[2:42:36] Zitrux: What could they do to BRD, to make it even more epic and relevant end game?
[2:42:37] srrycon: makes snese
[2:42:38] killthnrun: do you think Zul'Farak will be a raid
[2:42:40] MrSchneetzel: sunken temple for sure
[2:42:41] Moronomics: BRD into MC into BWL will all be too siimilar raids aesthetic wise
[2:42:44] TheSl1p: they need to give you a map though
[2:42:46] Oreo_Swagwagon: It is popular tho because of class quests
[2:42:47] stayfrosty92: BRD just has so much potential for more
[2:42:48] r0xorzb0xorz: @Zitrux NODDERS better loot would be sick
[2:42:52] cyb3rduck365: dire maul?
[2:42:54] In_Stillness: ST is epic
[2:42:56] TheSl1p: still get lost in that place
[2:42:56] ibustquick37: ST raid makes the most sense
[2:43:02] Rebukenx: can blizzard make me into a raid pls
[2:43:04] Raivan994: pumped up lvl 50 class quests hype
[2:43:04] RudyRube: ST is the best choice i think.  It needs a revamp in classic tbh
[2:43:04] arran564: KEKW
[2:43:14] warrenny: strat?
[2:43:25] EmanuShow: So questie shows them also?
[2:43:35] CringeK: @RudyRube They tried that before and ended up just sealing half the dungeon
[2:43:37] srrycon: Dire maul would be sick
[2:43:37] smorgo32: ive dying for a classic grim batol raid for years
[2:43:38] infom0rph: yeah they could make the ST class quests more interesting
[2:44:08] arran564: Germans can't do this strat, no spacebar Sadge
[2:44:17] gushhna: thats crazy your life drain is like a mageweave bandage
[2:44:22] aaronmv99: !talents

[2:44:27] EmanuShow: Good had questie just not updated it till now, thanks
[2:44:30] Highmen3: HUH
[2:44:40] Rsantiago12: what’s this for again?
[2:44:52] killthnrun: how do you find the reset spots my boy @StaysafeTV
[2:45:07] Mansford: put on a soul stone
[2:45:17] hoorayhang: Yo like when are they gonna make a new dungeon inside Jadenaar thats a demonic, twilightcult satyr infested hellpit with dreadlord boss and shit like that
[2:45:18] killthnrun: oh ok , i though you remember from before or smoething
[2:45:25] killthnrun: whats a brain?
[2:45:26] RudyRube: @killthnrun you need to learn which kind of walls you can "catch" on and get a double jump
[2:45:27] arran564: just don't die 4Head
[2:45:33] Highmen3: it stealthed into you
[2:45:35] pizzadad212: have you decided where to put the stream cave in the new place?
[2:45:36] Zitrux: BRD with raid loot? make it epic and relevant at the same time!
[2:45:43] Rofak5: soul stones are wild growth
[2:45:54] estagorec: sup) can u show build? and what build u use for pvp?
[2:45:56] Highmen3: @Zitrux BRD already has relevant loot
[2:46:00] dabby2121: its a bunker not a cave
[2:46:01] EmanuShow: People complain about blizzard support but you do not know how bad ESO support is
[2:46:02] R3ga1: Dig into the hill
[2:46:03] Highmen3: They just update it like they did with SM
[2:46:15] Bronloch: caves are legit comfy
[2:46:24] MrChaynes: any cool drops today mr streamer
[2:46:33] r0xorzb0xorz: I feel squishy as fuck in full destro tanking
[2:46:38] Zitrux: @Highmen3 Does it? Always thought it was pre-raid gear
[2:46:41] fietsopa4: discover BatChest
[2:46:56] stayfrosty92: just discover 4Head
[2:47:01] oli_himself: @StaysafeTV are you refreshing Incinerate buff while tanking? Is it worth casting it against the pushback from the boss
[2:47:09] estagorec: ty
[2:47:24] verkuttv: It is good you have to go to the spot
[2:47:27] graeme_tbm: Im playing pvp as affliction but 5 points in stamina from demo. works pretty well
[2:47:32] Highmen3: @Zitrux Pre-raid bis is considered relevant i'd say. It'll already be farmed just because it holds pre raid bis. HoJ is BiS trinket, Savage gladiator chain is insane as well.
[2:47:34] tecncaldificltes: gotta kill stone stewards for pendulum
[2:47:40] LoRswat: are you excited to see what a Lock can do in Mara in the future?
[2:47:53] remler_: pendulum farm ?
[2:48:07] MrChaynes: KEKW
[2:48:08] Highmen3: @Highmen3 update those pieces to scale with SoD and it'll be fine.
[2:48:11] dabby2121: :D
[2:48:14] MrChaynes: good times
[2:48:15] LoRswat: yessir
[2:48:18] hoorayhang: five year
[2:48:19] Deatharmor98: I love ur Mara streams tbh
[2:48:20] SharpGDKP: do you like gacha mmo’s? @staysafetv
[2:48:23] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: It will be a raid
[2:48:28] EmanuShow: All i can do with eso support is go a forum with crappy search function that mods dont read
[2:48:28] RedsquaredTV: My fiance says you look like Seth Rogan and Daniel Ratcliffe had a baby. XD
[2:48:35] Zitrux: @Highmen3 True, but this time around we might go into the last phase with previous season raid gear, making BRD not worth...
[2:48:35] StompingBox: Back to MARA Pog
[2:48:40] RedsquaredTV: A complement surely.
[2:48:43] sirdreadeye: true
[2:48:44] HexedPk: why call them gatcha when they are anime
[2:48:49] R3ga1: KEKW
[2:48:49] Afterh8: LOL
[2:48:49] Cykolai: Do you like Gachigasm mmos?
[2:48:51] summerteeth: he's so fucking cringe
[2:48:51] arran564: What D:

[2:48:55] Deatharmor98: WTF I LOVE SETH
[2:48:56] juicedawg: agreed
[2:48:58] R3ga1: Send him back to Canada
[2:48:59] killthnrun: send him to mars
[2:49:01] DobsonWireless: Freaks and Geeks?
[2:49:01] Hozitojones: wow
[2:49:02] Lava_in_a_Lamp: Why the Seth hate?
[2:49:03] firnal: agree. hes a fucking idiot
[2:49:05] hoorayhang: @StaysafeTV I raise you, Jack Black, sir
[2:49:06] BLUNDERGUN: hte interview though
[2:49:09] rsandoval305: i thought u guys were twin brothers
[2:49:10] pizzadad212: he’d be doing his laugh the entire time
[2:49:10] SharpGDKP: gacha mmo’s are like slot machine games but more fun
[2:49:12] Hozitojones: i can help!
[2:49:15] Highmen3: @Zitrux Probably not, as they are making existing items better and scaling them alongside us. And making the raids harder ofc.
[2:49:16] LoRswat: Schumer and Rogan...they actually got me quit Bud Light
[2:49:16] Fredthegred: but he is so funny, because he is always high BatChest
[2:49:20] hart_mk1: after he made that comment about burglary in LA i can't stand him
[2:49:21] r0xorzb0xorz: monkaLaugh ingame
[2:49:27] Lava_in_a_Lamp: Sausage party was pretty funny
[2:49:38] Deatharmor98: @hart_mk1 oh whatd he say?

[2:50:01] spookystylo: the fuck? that was easily his worst movie
[2:50:02] Deatharmor98: Sausage Party was funny for sure
[2:50:02] Highmen3: if your 12.5 maybe
[2:50:04] firnal: Pineapple express tho. So f funny
[2:50:05] SepeIio: It could've been ok as a 2 minute YouTube video maybe
[2:50:08] SharpGDKP: its edgy funny
[2:50:12] SharpGDKP: no bad
[2:50:12] Deatharmor98: Gotta be stoned to watch it
[2:50:14] sirdreadeye: watched sausage party with my 60 yr old dad.  slightly awkward.
[2:50:27] Lava_in_a_Lamp: Pineapple express was another good one
[2:50:36] Kkr0n1xX: Sausage Party was hilarious if you don't have the sense of humor of a holocaust survivor lol
[2:50:42] DobsonWireless: What about the Pickled Movie? where seth rogan falls into a big pool of pickle brine and was preserved for 100 years ?
[2:50:44] hart_mk1: @Deatharmor98 https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/seth-rogen-flamed-dismissing-la-155639143.html
[2:50:46] Zitrux: Try the Urn in the midle
[2:50:53] Zumakx: I watched sausage party with my little niece.. I was gigging like a litte girl and she was giving me the look

[2:52:05] BLUNDERGUN: @StaysafeTV just pulled and lost roll on Underworld band in SM cathedral
[2:52:06] Kuja_: they're like 3g i think
[2:52:07] whitenoise407: No way
[2:52:07] Highmen3: But still good
[2:52:08] Mulictz: is true

[2:53:12] firnal: Et øjeblik :D
[2:53:16] hart_mk1: @Deatharmor98 he's defending the city and it's inhabitants breaking and entering into personal property
[2:53:17] hoorayhang: Ett ögonblick
[2:53:32] Zitrux: Literary translate to "one blink of an eye"
[2:53:40] Gryphaaa: Widely know fact by the way, Just a fact a lot of people know real quick. Staysafe was actually born in the Land of the Rising Sun
[2:53:48] Mulictz: 50% price drop from last night
[2:53:51] Mulictz: that's crazy
[2:54:15] pizzadad212: @hart_mk1 his point of don’t leave valuables in car is good. but defending getting broken into 15 times is brain dead LUL idk how he got to that opinion
[2:54:35] verkuttv: waste of time just do AOE pull
[2:54:53] Zitrux: You can approach the Ø sound from the English “word” or “learn” sound
[2:54:57] WhineGodTV: if you live in a high trust society you could leave anything in your unlocked car and not even think about it.
[2:55:16] hart_mk1: @pizzadad212 that's what i'm saying, i agree, don't leave valuables in cars but he defends the city and it's inhabitants and says "LA is great, my car has been burglarized 15 times!"

[8:16:44] BadGerbilLion: If he is that obsessed with doing 5% more damage, entire raid needs to get new world buffs. Otherwise he needs to stfu
