[0:14:41] Axiomu: all disc mains in shambles right now LUL
[0:14:42] TonyJhee: Also, the apparent 40% increase to health and damage taken is an interesting change
[0:14:46] TonyJhee: It makes sense though
[0:14:54] TonyJhee: Health bars are moving too fast
[0:15:21] TonyJhee: Smallpriest's 70k hps with 63% overheal
[0:15:55] TLK___: or bring less healer
[0:15:56] MacGregor3: wait 40% increased dmg taken?
[0:16:17] TonyJhee: @MacGregor3 According to Max, yeah
[0:16:32] TonyJhee: HP bars are 40% larger and mechanics from dungeons/raids do 40% more damage
[0:16:48] MacGregor3: fuken hell
[0:16:51] TonyJhee: So technically not 40% increased damage taken
[0:17:01] StreamElements: TheIlluminati What are this week's affixes? What are next week's affixes? https://mythicpl.us/
[0:17:10] TonyJhee: Which given how much damage people are doing one shotting people in PvP, also a welcome change for my arenas.
[0:17:12] MacGregor3: yeah the other way is better, cus increased dmg taken is technically a more multi
[0:17:34] holycashew: @MacGregor3 basically before you would take 50% of your helth from a hit and be almost instantly healed, now you still take 50% of your health in damage from the same hit but get healed slower
[0:17:45] TonyJhee: I like the change
[0:18:03] TonyJhee: Much better than moving towards the Legion type healing where everything hits and heals for 80% of your hp bar
[0:18:10] MacGregor3: yeah agree
[0:18:38] coweelissa: wait, isen't that just a straight up nerf to healing and making it harder to heal, and healthbar moves down the same pace?
[0:18:48] TonyJhee: Technically, yes
[0:18:51] MacGregor3: which healers benefit most from that style of healing u think? my pea dps brain is too dumb to think outside of 'leech gooder now'
[0:18:53] Icycutes: KEKW
[0:18:56] TonyJhee: But healers are doing so mcuh overhealing anyhow

[0:21:29] MacGregor3: wouldnt druid hots also gain more value than in a more burst heal format? because you can let them linger along with dps leech mechanics fx
[0:22:44] capriccios: hello jb. you've already answered but why are you using kyr link with swarm?
[0:22:46] Rypick: What are your thoughts with priest buff vs druid buff in the  healer position. Wit h the dps comparison of priest vs druid favoring druid would you lean more towards the priest for healer slot or do you think druid is just better dps still in the healer slot
[0:23:28] TonyJhee: I think Rdruid would be net neutral (thought I am not certain). Their hots already match any rot damage that is happening. They currently move Hp bars from 90%-100%. With this change it's just them moving hp from 70%-80% with other healers spot healing.
[0:24:18] BigComfyCouch: *monkey's paw curls*
[0:24:27] TonyJhee: @Rypick I think we will still see double disc in RWF, but RDruid stonks are def rising.
[0:24:34] TonyJhee: That said, boomkin still does the best spread out AoE in the game.
[0:25:18] Rypick: @TonyJhee cheers
[0:25:29] TonyJhee: Still highly likely we see a couple moonkins. That said, Shadow also has spread out AoE via Psychic link, so who knows.
[0:25:38] capriccios: i mean, kyrian leggo still doesn't work with swarm right?

[0:29:54] archangelazrael117: @TonyJhee i play caster pala
[0:30:28] TonyJhee: @archangelazrael117 How you like it?
[0:30:43] nixar1: grats
[0:30:49] D0rk: lets go
[0:30:52] Aggroboy: yo
[0:31:01] StreamElements: TheIlluminati What are this week's affixes? What are next week's affixes? https://mythicpl.us/
[0:31:03] archangelazrael117: @TonyJhee love it, my healing is not dependant on doing dps. i can do dps if i want to now instead of it being necessary.
[0:31:32] scarwryn: thank god youre live this early.
[0:31:51] laokung: yo jb what's your read on rdruid being every multiclass healers fav, do you also feel vindicated?
[0:32:03] TonyJhee: @archangelazrael117 Is it fair to say you feel you have a grater sense of freedom? Do you feel like Holy light is clunky at all?
[0:33:17] archangelazrael117: @TonyJhee put it like this: i abandoned my favorite spec in SL S1 because of the awful melee builds ( maraads was okay but still had to do some dps ) now it's i don't need to do a single point of damage whatsoever + holy light if talented correctly heals for a metric ton
[0:33:41] zooyep: well its still early :)
[0:33:48] greywolffa52: lol

[0:34:04] Allerion_SE: LUL
[0:34:05] TonyJhee: @archangelazrael117 Do you ever find your Holy light healing is "sniped" as you are casting it? Like the target no longer needs healing and you feel like the cast is wasted?
[0:34:06] Axiomu: Blizzard probably heard you were gonna multiclass and decided to make druid the go to class :)
[0:34:31] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[0:34:49] archangelazrael117: @TonyJhee not really, because say if we are 2 melees 1 ranged me and tank, the melee will still get healed with the " cleave " talent which also makes it super good for mana efficiency
[0:34:54] TonyJhee: Also @archangelazrael117 Do Barrier of Faith and/or Tyr's feel good?
[0:35:17] zooyep: disc is also harder for most people
[0:35:20] archangelazrael117: @TonyJhee they do feel really good but you want them at lvl 70 not now
[0:35:23] laokung: have you given your read on evoker? would love to hear your general thoughts about how you might see it fitting it (talking more bout mplus) @jdotb
[0:35:29] laokung: healer
[0:35:35] archangelazrael117: @TonyJhee look up Kàlira on armory that is my holydin
[0:35:42] TonyJhee: Lemme have a look
[0:35:47] archangelazrael117: on silvermoon server tho
[0:35:48] ESL_Awaiting: not sure how i feel about the crafting shit in df tho
[0:35:53] sseijas: do you think mw going to be better with windwalker nerfs?
[0:36:01] greywolffa52: Tuning before DF still a variable though
[0:36:18] TonyJhee: @archangelazrael117 Is that EU?
[0:36:22] Axiomu: No shot they are gonna make evoker not strong in their expansion
[0:36:31] Arrupaka: I feel like there is no way its going to be bad.
[0:36:35] archangelazrael117: @TonyJhee yeah

[0:37:32] TonyJhee: @archangelazrael117 You using maraad's at all?
[0:37:36] TonyJhee: Or is it too clunky?
[0:37:38] sseijas: do you think mw going to be better with windwalker nerfs?
[0:37:41] archangelazrael117: @TonyJhee nope
[0:37:48] archangelazrael117: @TonyJhee not even as a leggo
[0:38:10] TonyJhee: @archangelazrael117 You have a log at all? Would love to see your casts
[0:38:26] archangelazrael117: @TonyJhee that im not sure about, you can try look it up
[0:38:38] archangelazrael117: i do keys mostly
[0:38:51] TonyJhee: Oh gotcha. So you haven't done much caster in raid?
[0:39:07] TonyJhee: That's where most of my interest in caster Hpal lies.
[0:39:19] archangelazrael117: did a 10/10 castle run last week as caster so can look for that? if it's not up then no one was logging
[0:39:32] TonyJhee: lemme see
[0:39:36] KeyboardDeath: When I play classes they do get nerfed :)
[0:39:41] mordekhuul: Man MW feels good in prepatch with fistweaving and the odd insta-cast vivify cleave to shore things up
[0:39:57] TonyJhee: @mordekhuul Yeah it does
[0:40:06] TonyJhee: I do worry it wont scale well into higher keys though
[0:41:14] TonyJhee: I think the biggest thing that will make MW feel good is proper use of Chi'ji
[0:41:51] mordekhuul: Did you discuss the nerfs from other night yet? Disc etc :P
[0:42:36] texaspanhandler: h priest going to be pog again going into DF S1 even after 5% nerfs methinks
[0:43:28] Thrylos: @jdotb sorry to bother you and I’m sure you asked this. Can you give a quick recap on what you feel about rdruid? Specifically for m+? Do you think it will compete with hpriest?
[0:43:39] Thrylos: Answered this*
[0:43:48] Discpic: another season of Hpriest ResidentSleeper
[0:44:29] zooyep: naw it will be fine in raids you'll still need 1 for prog.. or could use one
[0:44:29] LessThanFreshPrinceOfBA: Feels fucking sad man. Disc has always been my baby and I just cant play it
[0:44:54] mordekhuul: So just pray that boomies and guardian druid sucks (which it just got a sucky re-work, so...)

[0:45:28] Thrylos: Are boomies pretty much a spot now though?
[0:45:29] mordekhuul: I guess Evoker is the competition - maybe least likely to get nerfed since Blizz will want it to have a strong showing

[0:48:02] texaspanhandler: @arrupaka It really is one of the most engaging healing specs imo
[0:48:14] Thrylos: Yeah Druid looks fun. Do you not suggest any cat dps and prefer going spells for dps in keys?
[0:48:55] Thrylos: Or Peter
[0:48:57] texaspanhandler: @thrylos you can do a lot of boomie casting without switching forms which can save you a gcd. I’m not sure how the damage compares overall though

[1:30:34] Taslack: @jdotb shred should be doing more damage than rake on prepatch?
[1:30:40] xxEmz: jeeez ur dmg dude, ty for the key LUL
[1:30:56] Taslack: even with adaptive swarm and draught
[1:31:01] Ioldoink: interesting

[1:31:12] the_pyke: what would be your choise in a world without druid? :D
[1:32:01] Taslack: shred is 68% ap, rake is 16% with swarm + draught
[1:32:23] Taslack: this was correct in live before df
[1:32:27] Ioldoink: yeah i just tested
[1:32:31] Ioldoink: looks like shred is more
[1:32:31] Taslack: but they nerfed rake initial hit by 40%
[1:32:36] Taslack: they only nerfed the rake initial hit
[1:32:40] Taslack: because us ferals were gonna use it over shred
[1:32:56] Ioldoink: for me shred is about 60-80% stronger
[1:33:00] Joschi174: @jdotb how much of ur dps is prepatch only ?
[1:33:12] Taslack: yeah but ferals would have so we got them to change it
[1:33:23] Taslack: saved

[2:57:54] Accalon_: In DF you have cloaks that give you like 750 tertiary
[2:57:54] engenheiro_reverso: ty
[2:58:22] Accalon_: cloak enchants*
[2:58:56] Vodrin: so its nice with convoke
[2:59:30] manwe_infi: with nourish?
[2:59:35] Accalon_: Might also be able to use that with vigil as balance...
[2:59:35] manwe_infi: boom
[2:59:39] OrganicJKW: Was that 10% crit increase?
[3:00:21] OrganicJKW: 2600, yeah.

[3:29:30] big___jim: prosit!
[3:29:39] SolarNexis: on use?

[3:31:12] UltraRareSHOOBER: catJAM
[3:31:15] andyl0l: This song is a banger tbh
[3:31:46] RedxZone13: Wowhead just released a post titled "Blizzard on Changes to Player Health/Creature Damage in Dragonflight Content - Healers Too Powerful" uh-oh
[3:31:58] Basic_3: Bluepost about healing. They're adding 40% stam to players, and same damage to mobs

[3:34:06] not_vern: What healers are looking strong? Hpal felt so clunky when I did some keys on it last night

[3:39:39] RedxZone13: the shield ring wasnt proccing for me
[3:40:58] mackoida: The web trinket felt waay too strong as a dps
[3:42:43] toast042: it doesn't work on some abilities at the moment
[3:43:02] sseijas: u think st of druid gonna get nerf?
[3:43:04] toast042: i tried it on evoker yesterday and it didn't work with living flame? I guess it's a little bugged
[3:43:13] Emily_says: Good morning
[3:43:16] RedxZone13: that ring gonna be DH bis ring i bet lol
[3:43:17] BossBuzz: just become an engineer and throw bombs, that has to be fire damage right? :)
[3:43:20] andyl0l: Sunfire not being fire damage is wild to me
[3:43:21] toast042: oh :0 odd
[3:44:12] Emily_says: Are you noticing the 40% increase to player health and creature damage on beta yet? @jdotb
[3:44:13] RedxZone13: Yea i was sad to see that holy fire was not fire damage, just holy damage lol
[3:44:46] Vodrin: 180k
[3:44:49] RedxZone13: My priest as around 190k
[3:44:58] RedxZone13: had*
[3:45:13] Vodrin: so it looks like its already in

[3:47:43] Wiseved: Hello, are we checking dungeon trinkets? and why is the furious ragefeather the best one atm
[3:49:25] danksly: can u still heal while in ele form
[3:49:33] manwe_infi: maybe that web trinket is good for firemage
[3:49:43] RedxZone13: Saw a ret pally do 450k with storm eaters boon lol
[3:50:02] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[3:50:36] Zirikh: are MW bad??, i have seen like 2 of them in pre patch so wondering
[3:50:47] Morkiius: If u need help for any test tell me im here
[3:51:21] GIimmerGG: true
[3:51:57] flowmotion_x: ive been playing MW a bunch, tanks definitely need to play around faeline, but its hard at higher keys
[3:52:00] Zulbukh: have you seen the 40% stam buff for everyone + 40% damage nerf  for all mobs?
[3:52:02] Wiseved: Did u check out the mote btw? it was trash in legion but it seems to be doing some healing now
[3:52:07] Zulbukh: i like it but wtf
[3:52:24] Zulbukh: might shift the heal meta away from dps
[3:52:46] menzlo: blue post
[3:52:49] Zulbukh: they officialized it
[3:53:57] Vodrin: makes tanks less super self-efficient too
[3:54:00] danksly: going in to millions legion vibes
[3:54:06] Lyrathos: wasnt there an addon where lua error got popped in, so no error popups anymore?
[3:54:10] Voltrey: they saved the big numbers which is all we really want
[3:54:28] Zulbukh: but yeah I like it, game has been feeling too oneshotty

[3:54:36] Vodrin: @Lyrathos you can use the script if you're never going to report the errors
[3:54:47] Zulbukh: yes
[3:55:02] toast042: good change
[3:55:14] Lyrathos: @Lyrathos nah, i wanna track and read them, but the pop up is anoying in some situations
[3:55:17] iServeTheFlamingFist: This is a pretty huge change to make now though. Like for tanks some have flat value self-healing and some have percentage-based. So huge buff for percentage-based self-healing.
[3:55:27] Scikey: are they any healers struggling a bit with m+ already, making it harder for them?
[3:55:28] Vodrin: @Lyrathos then i think the addon is called 'bugsacker'
[3:55:29] danksly: rez bot meta isnt fun
[3:55:33] Lyrathos: ty
[3:55:40] not_vern: I just want instant fast wild growth back
[3:55:43] manwe_infi: that is Holy priest job quick 0 to 100
[3:55:47] Voltrey: what they said in the bluepost is very good understanding and reasoning and a good change to fix it. Rare Blizzard W
[3:55:50] Zulbukh: better now than in the middle of DF S2 lol
[3:55:55] illidansr2: @jdotb  hello is resto druid meta class in df?
[3:56:14] Wiseved: My hpriest has 400k hp with DP now YEP
[3:56:21] UltraRareSHOOBER: healing will be fine COPIUM
[3:56:29] zebracak35: i give the developers a break since th epeople who chose the release date dont even talk to the people balancing the game let alone being teh same people
[3:56:32] menzlo: it seemed like healing was kinda hard in a 15 on beta before this change
[3:56:59] danksly: feels nice as a tank to gain chonk pepeL
[3:57:05] flowmotion_x: time to bring the rest of the healing classes down to the floor, AKA Mistweaver
[3:57:23] TonyJhee: Yeah, much rather have people's healthbars move much slower and have to constantly heal
[3:57:30] TonyJhee: also makes for hype fights where people are low for longer
[3:57:33] TonyJhee: adds tension
[3:57:41] iServeTheFlamingFist: Oh yeah, as a healer main I totally like this change. Just seems to reset a lot of the balance changes they've made when there's a lot of % based heals in the game.
[3:57:48] Morkiius: Maybe cen ward will proc on me now after change 🤣
[3:58:16] menzlo: if feral or balance are not meta it'll help rdruid
[3:58:16] Morkiius: Nah we just dont play shield talents anymore
[3:58:29] manwe_infi: JB is nature's vigil feels strong in dps?
[3:58:32] Zulbukh: its trash leggo but as a talent
[3:58:49] danksly: earthwarden is one of if not best tank passive in the game
[3:59:01] manwe_infi: oh
[3:59:02] Zulbukh: oh yeah the 40% thing is  huge buff to NV lol
[3:59:04] danksly: hold up does it still exist KEKW
[3:59:31] Vodrin: ye buts its nerfed
[3:59:40] Zulbukh: wait it procced from overhealing?
[3:59:44] Zulbukh: i thought it didnt
[4:00:02] manwe_infi: that sounds broken
[4:00:11] Zulbukh: yea, but protector doesnt
[4:00:38] Vodrin: yes
[4:00:47] menzlo: @Lisa_Lava_Lake hes been talking about it
[4:01:02] StreamElements: TheIlluminati What are this week's affixes? What are next week's affixes? https://mythicpl.us/
[4:01:19] Zulbukh: you just macro it to flourish right?
[4:01:28] flowmotion_x: @jdotb not sure if you've played MW enough, but Im noticing it this week, MW feels exceptionally awful on grevious, like non of their class mechanics for healing tend to pull off stacks except directly vivifying, am I dumb/doing something wrong? ancient teachings def doesnt seem to do anything
[4:01:55] Holyryze: we donig kitty weaving or boom weaving for dungeons you think in df?
[4:02:04] menzlo: @Lisa_Lava_Lake yes
[4:02:33] oakeri: rem should remove a stack too
[4:02:46] big___jim: vivify cleave removes stacks iirc? or did they fix that
[4:03:12] flowmotion_x: I don't think my vivify cleaves were removing stacks, but I'd have to pay a little closer attention to it
[4:03:21] Tellas: Have you read the blue post on healing being too powerful in DF?
[4:03:32] flowmotion_x: might be opting to go rising mists this week over faeline then to extend out my mists
[4:03:57] danksly: oh no puzzle druid NotLikeThis
[4:04:18] ninah_wtf: @danksly LUL LUL  puzzle druid lul
[4:04:19] WytherOK: can we call it catorkin weaving?
[4:05:09] Tellas: At least it's not just me then, when I was doing a few beta keys I was always confused why I was overhealing so much
[4:05:19] mikanikos5407: can u plz show dmg jb
[4:05:38] Vodrin: for season 1 yeah its a bit crazy
[4:05:42] athemick: It's true this will also nerf tank selfsustain :) so they may need some healing now

[4:06:06] mikanikos5407: do u thrash in aoe
[4:06:25] paul1008_: When you're playing evoker what are your priorities when you need to do healing? Been struggling alot in ST on beta myself
[4:06:35] danksly: there hasnt been a time ive tested on any of the tanks where i didnt feel fine
[4:06:37] RudolphTV: How do u think the new beta patch about the healing too powerful?
[4:07:08] danksly: everything felt undertuned but people were dying to stuff
[4:07:24] manwe_infi: that is actual deathstrike right?
[4:07:33] menzlo: @tinyrudy rewind his vod 10 mins
[4:07:42] puddypounce: yes it's a mini deathstrike
[4:07:43] paul1008_: ohhh I didn't know it copied golden hour that's kinda big'
[4:08:00] RudolphTV: ty
[4:08:23] denloth: I wish some of the overheal could turn into a shield. it could be better but this time it would be too strong
[4:08:35] manwe_infi: stasis feels good i think
[4:08:45] not_vern: !build
[4:08:47] graham_xd: thoughts on the 40% health changes?

[4:09:23] paul1008_: Thank you for answering jb :)
[4:09:43] proNappelz: Takes on Disc Evang change?
[4:09:59] toast042: ooh
[4:10:00] Meltmind: will this change affect the current healer rankings or is it going to stay the same?
[4:10:08] puddypounce: pretty sure it's just a tooltip change
[4:10:12] danksly: its soo good but in a terrible spot imo
[4:10:56] xblameworthy: no capstones on evoker?  that's wild
[4:11:11] danksly: didnt hear that nobody heard anything
[4:11:13] puddypounce: delete the vod
[4:11:30] Avatarblade: so will that change screw over all their m+ tuning done so far?
[4:11:33] Vandarian: Damage up by 40% means 40% more for Rewind to undo too
[4:12:17] iServeTheFlamingFist: Barrier buff. Disc is saved.
[4:12:25] iServeTheFlamingFist: Lenience #1 OP.
[4:12:48] proNappelz: Disc is just straight up gone now...
[4:13:10] proNappelz: No idea what their intentions are with that change. Still waiting on a dev note there
[4:13:13] laokung: hey jb for people who haven't done keys on beta, how do we mentally prepare to heal as evoker?
[4:13:15] HankeTheGreat: @proNappelz it's not. Only the degenerate gameplay that disc has been since legion.
[4:13:17] laokung: xD
[4:13:58] HankeTheGreat: should ask how all the other healers that have been benched in prog. feel about the disc. nerfs.
[4:14:03] proNappelz: @proNappelz ngl I enjoy it way more than I did Cata/WoD Disc

[4:15:02] StreamElements: TheIlluminati What are this week's affixes? What are next week's affixes? https://mythicpl.us/
[4:15:19] HankeTheGreat: played disc. since vanilla. Not STOKED on the nerfs to disc., but I'm happy to see it go in a different direction that's actually closer to its original roots.
[4:15:44] TonyJhee: oh and astral bonus hp feeds back into living flame too
[4:15:47] RedxZone13: Theres a dracthyr only weapon on the tier vendor if you didnt know @jdotb
[4:16:03] manwe_infi: what do you think about anormaly
[4:16:23] proNappelz: @HankeTheGreat I'm just missing an explanation why they decided on changing it this much this late in the dev cycle...
[4:16:30] iServeTheFlamingFist: Definitely seems Evoker got the best out of it of the healers.
[4:16:58] hippyfighter101: Hey guys 3 weeks until the expansion, you healers are too good at healing so we are making everything hit harder by 40% and everyone has 40% more hp
[4:16:59] Deejeh: They'll nerf it from 30% of your max health to 20% and people will lose their mind soon enough
[4:17:00] HankeTheGreat: @HankeTheGreat to buff Dracthyr, TBH. I really don't agree with that part.
[4:17:28] TheLennee: Hello
[4:17:40] proNappelz: we're 4 weeks before release and suddenly the core of waht the class was for 6-7 years now @HankeTheGreat
[4:18:34] HankeTheGreat: @proNappelz not saying I agree with the devs decisions. The combo of last minute nerfs with buffs to HP and damage intake really just spell out a poor approach to making Dractyhr healers more relevant.
[4:18:42] dhands: @hippyfighter101 game is definitely ready for release Kappa
[4:19:00] zebracak35: pvp changes some things
[4:19:03] mordekhuul: It's a great change - particularly for throughput healers like resto druid and MW
[4:19:26] iServeTheFlamingFist: "Just happens that the newest class benefits the most"
[4:19:43] hippyfighter101: Changes tanks quite abit tho
[4:19:47] HankeTheGreat: @mordekhuul I think I could see it IF discipline didn't require noticeably more work to play well. Other healers literally have a single button for their throughput.
[4:19:54] hippyfighter101: All non % self heals on tanks got shat on
[4:20:02] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[4:20:03] vioO_cs: is the overheal for every healer that extreme?
[4:20:12] manwe_infi: what is best stasis 3 spell might be... hmm
[4:20:21] fabricio_cs2: fabricio_cs2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! hi JB
[4:20:37] Vodrin: mistweaver have that 2% heal on damage taken too
[4:20:47] mordekhuul: @mordekhuul To be fair - Disc playstyle just got murdered, so maybe not worth considering them until/if Blizz revives them somehow :P
[4:20:48] jaydeheals: during mythic raidtesting as a tank my HP bar didnt move
[4:21:03] Wiseved: Tank healing feels the complete opposite of SL S1 atm
[4:21:07] Morkiius: @jaydeheals sounds like warrior problem :)
[4:21:11] mush80: @iServeTheFlamingFist Well Evoker is prob mid tier in DPS and Heal. I predict that the will be fever Evokers than it was DKs and DHs at release. And even fewer after 1. season.
[4:21:13] proNappelz: Now its time to wait for Cat to get castrated and Prot Pally to get fixed
[4:21:15] Neanthi: yes disc are dead :(
[4:21:25] Snypl3: Isn't it weird they went with this approach rather than "reduce all healing done by 40%", instead of opening hundreds of avenues which now require tuning from raid-pvp-dungeons-open world creatures, etc.

[4:52:11] Vaynor22: right but having checked it out on beta, changing stuff like that is 100% necessary
[4:52:22] Vaynor22: frenzied regen heals for 280k right now on beta @400 ilvl
