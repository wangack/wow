[2:40:36] reggiepowa: first 10-15 levels its ok after that it barely deals any dmg and you cant even reliably use it since mobs destroy you between packs
[2:40:46] FresheFefe: druid lvling is fun with the runes
[2:40:50] Calibur84: Starsurge too if you can get to the rune. It's op at low lvls
[2:40:52] thalalis: Then go to Wetlands and get the Starsurge rune.

[2:47:00] cyrex172: tow if u end of with five level 60 characters by end of sod I will be impressed.
[2:47:13] drewetling: stomp
[2:47:41] geokouts: aoe taunt
[2:47:42] cyrex172: people seriously underestimating the classic grind to 60
[2:48:11] TheUnknowing: honestly with the phases broken up as they are it wont be as bad @cyrex172
[2:48:34] wartoothdesigns: I hate caves LOL I'm a mage and will port out of a cave and fly back to where I need... that level of hate.
[2:49:08] el_savic: im fully bis on my druid and i still find stuff to do... People wanting to rush and rush the experience are nuts
[2:49:15] cyrex172: i thought they gave us same time
[2:49:19] cyrex172: ahh
[2:49:24] el_savic: kinda hoping they make a lot of changes, even more than phase 1
[2:50:04] cyrex172: i feel like it was a lot of time for the first phase maybe too much
[2:50:21] crymeog: im getting close to 23, this will be my third 25, and i got a 15 as well -_-
[2:50:29] SamuraiWillZ916: i heard they are increasing the xp to level for 1-25 after phase 2
[2:50:36] DarthWrex: @towelliee I leveled my mage to 25 on a second monitor while working my dev job in 32 hours played.  Thats staying logged in during meeting and working too.
[2:50:53] cyrex172: @samuraiwillz916 interesting
[2:51:08] el_savic: yeah but image new class quests, new systems for waylaid supply rep, maybe new world bosses?
[2:51:18] DarthWrex: You‚Äôre not wrong
[2:51:24] Curleaf: What if I'm watching the stream while working, that's kind of working.
[2:51:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: my health insurance went up again for this year, so hooray for making less money!
[2:51:41] cyrex172: that warlock tank rune hahaha
[2:51:48] DarthWrex: Oh, and your stream up on the third monitor of course.  lmao
[2:51:49] justpeacealways: People gonna be selling carrys for gold for runes
[2:51:55] Curleaf: Except the heal rune, none of the Druid runes needed help.
[2:52:06] el_savic: i think its physical abilities automatic but spell ranks not?
[2:52:29] crymeog: that tower is still rough
[2:52:34] justpeacealways: I did the meta lock rune solo, its ez. youtube has a video for it
[2:52:40] Curleaf: Skull bash rune took some gold though
[2:52:45] Nerendis: @curleaf wild growth? I soloed it
[2:52:46] justpeacealways: you dont have to fight anything
[2:53:18] Curleaf: I haven't done that one yet.
[2:53:21] Seerated: So basically I'm fucked with my slow 22 lock, sigh
[2:53:33] FlatulentBeaver: victory rush seems to suck at higher levels
[2:53:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: phase 2 can take its time, ive got other games to catch up on
[2:53:42] DarthWrex: or the people that dont level alts and want to play more of one toon
[2:53:55] DarthWrex: ^

[2:56:01] ashtin2220: the SM raid will be lit
[2:56:19] el_savic: imagine they add a 4 or 5 peace dungeon set from 30-50 like defias or druid of the fang set
[2:56:22] Molvonos: Yea, phase 3
[2:56:28] el_savic: piece *
[2:56:49] Kundersmack: Do you think bfd will change at all?
[2:56:50] TheUnknowing: I would assume no since they shut down gnomer
[2:56:51] Screamnsteam: people farm SM mobs now lol
[2:56:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: shutting down SM will not go over well LUL
[2:57:00] spansonite1: lol
[2:57:16] cyrex172: scholomance is phase 2 r
[2:57:34] TheUnknowing: gnomer is @cyrex172

[2:57:44] ChrisarN: Imo, phase 1 has been to damn long...
[2:57:55] cyrex172: oh yeah scholo is phase 3
[2:58:21] Jsibs: Druid Mace wont be replaced till gnomer raid mace
[2:58:24] xxlegitghostxx: you still got suken temple dire maul
[2:58:34] crymeog: @el_savic like upgrade defias or fang, like they did for scholo sets to 1.5
[2:58:35] cyrex172: cant wait for scholo.  and mc
[2:58:46] Sauby02: what sucks is bfd gear is better than lvl 40 dungeon gear so pretty much everything but gnome gear will be ireleveant
[2:59:01] Shrenko: I hope they do something with Molten core, BWL etc.
[2:59:04] ChrisarN: Need phase 2 soon!
[2:59:18] Snabido: Depends what else gets added too, no?
[2:59:22] Curleaf: There were chests around this quest area for supply boxes.
[2:59:42] grimmlols: hopefully they scale it
[2:59:46] Kevst0r: cant w8 to stil farm bfd during p2 for the  druid mace
[2:59:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: corpsemaker is slightly better than fathomblade
[3:00:05] cyrex172: i need to get my crafting skills up
[3:00:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: corpsemaker is not better than the epic though
[3:00:09] cyrex172: ive been lazy
[3:00:12] Frosted2319: think corpsemarker still going to be the best till raid
[3:00:27] Frosted2319: 15 str is nice
[3:00:30] grimmlols: just making it a small upgrade still makes it exciting
[3:00:54] cyrex172: holidays and diablo 4 took me away from wow for a minute time to get back into it
[3:00:54] Frosted2319: 0
[3:00:57] Pwncakee: none
[3:01:03] justpeacealways: raid exp is dramatically reduced
[3:01:05] Frosted2319: thought you didnt get xp in raid
[3:01:06] grimmlols: what if they shut it down
[3:01:35] Curleaf: Inspect quest
[3:01:44] jordanc86: I'm a little behind on SoD.  Whats the deal with those new class tyoes, Mage Healer and stuff?
[3:01:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: a dev is hinting at ways to level for people that did all their quests for gold, doing a bfd for a decent chunk of xp could be it
[3:02:10] cyrex172: warrior is prob the second least interesting class to me after priest
[3:02:40] Nerendis: Victory Rush also heals even if you miss, dodge, etc.
[3:02:58] Kevst0r: @HaxzorJimDuggan ngl rewarding doing quests for g even more is dumb
[3:03:10] cyrex172: have any of u guys played a game called deliverance kingdom come?
[3:03:16] Shrenko: I made alts to do quests at lvl 25, made over 150gold so far
[3:03:19] Nerendis: @Kevst0r That's the way the game has been since 2004
[3:03:38] aimassistallen: shaman tanks are so goo
[3:03:40] aimassistallen: good
[3:03:56] Kevst0r: @Nerendis but not  that early

[3:04:09] AGodUponStars: just did my first +25 as ele shaman on atal dazar i hate this dungeon
[3:04:25] DarthWrex: thought you were supposed to water shield or whatever its called for mana issues
[3:04:25] TheUnknowing: fr fr no cap
[3:04:33] Nerendis: @Kevst0r It has been hard coded that max level quests convert xp to gold. This is nothing different than 2004 other than the max level is different.
[3:04:36] chrisrev: shield mastery is supposed to scale really well. the higher your mana the more you get back from the procs

[3:05:15] strongstout: jawn?
[3:05:16] Effin_Steffin: Jawn
[3:05:19] ambiotic: Jawn
[3:05:22] eatonaround: Jawn
[3:05:24] m4x1gh: jawn
[3:05:27] AGodUponStars: huh
[3:05:28] Kevst0r: @Nerendis my point is that there shouldt be a way for ppl to get more exp once they have exhausted their quest they did for g insteaf of getting exp, they destroyed the economy and shouldt get more exp as a rewards
[3:05:32] ambiotic: That is a big one in philly
[3:05:33] strongstout: ah yes lol that jawn
[3:05:41] codermonkey7: i used to be from philly can confirm jawn is a thing
[3:05:46] grimmlols: it‚Äôs newer lol
[3:05:51] strongstout: in jawn we trust
[3:06:02] grimmlols: people in Michigan say it too
[3:06:03] Nerendis: @Kevst0r 1. Economy is destroyed at all lol. 2. just dungeon grind - it's faster xp/hr anyway
[3:06:22] Nerendis: economy isn't destroyed8
[3:07:00] danoh_64: I'm from Philly and I stay out of that toilet at all costs
[3:07:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Kevst0r then the casual players that just did everything not knowing that they could be screwing themselves later would be in a bind and if they didnt have a dungeon group they would be screwed
[3:07:58] cyrex172: just pooped.     was good
[3:08:02] cyrex172: always
[3:08:03] Curleaf: Ruined scrap make light leather
[3:08:10] Nerendis: @Kevst0r Right. It's the questing and NOT the gold buyers doing that.
[3:08:13] shredit_813: Hey Towelie sorry random question, I saw you opening a bunch of cards the other day, do you have any recommendations on which site to use to get cards?
[3:08:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Kevst0r what if a casual didn't know about dungeon spam
[3:08:41] ambiotic: Dave and Adams, Steelcity, Blowout
[3:08:46] shredit_813: Cool cool thats what I was thinking and already doing :)
[3:08:48] Baladore: @shredit_813 I think he has a link but I don't know the command
[3:08:51] Nerendis: @HaxzorJimDuggan NGL, I don't think this is a productive discussion. He just wants to complain.

[3:11:12] TweektheProphet: I like ripping at my local shop because it feels more hype when you pull something good
[3:11:17] Curleaf: Could be a money arguement
[3:11:20] wareagle07: i don't stream so ripping in shop with other people that like the hobby just makes sense for me
[3:11:31] gooni_coyg: isnt that how it is to be a boy in a mans life.. I know i need to be adult but...

[3:23:17] Pwncakee: and play with warbringer
[3:23:30] Pwncakee: charge in combat is gucci

[4:01:57] cyrex172: so panini is kinda shady r
[4:02:02] ambiotic: cause they are basically selling boxes, so they are able to show sales
[4:02:32] ambiotic: Yep, and its why you are starting with the most views of any streamer in the hobby, cause you are still having fun vs business
[4:02:49] ambiotic: people are burned out on pro breaks
[4:03:20] ambiotic: the hobby is in its balance the game for the 1% phase

[5:03:37] brewtank: @Towelliee energy def is a bit weird in classic eps with runes
[5:03:39] Coresmoke420: use it each boss really
[5:03:40] PadidinJones: 5 in retail
[5:03:40] brewtank: esp*
[5:03:58] hammack52: most likely there will ba a passive rune that will make your off hand attack give energy back cause if my memory servers me right there was a passive like that in wrath
[5:04:01] Vile_: Add more rune slots per gear slot.
[5:04:02] rymerre: i think they will do all main set
[5:04:07] EllisTheMenace1: payoT payoT payoT
[5:04:08] zhr0: There's been additional rune slots data mined
[5:04:10] Vile_: For example, in Phase 2 have 2 gloves lots.
[5:04:20] PotbellyGoat: we need a rune for our rune slot
[5:04:21] zhr0: Like a cloak, belt, boots, etc
[5:04:25] brewtank: @Towelliee does mana on prot pal feel good?
[5:04:25] falldrgn: Shadowlands? We don't talk abouit that place..
[5:04:36] TheUnknowing: well they could add like helm, cloak, etc slots
[5:04:41] rymerre: my bet is all main set...so shoulders, helm next
[5:04:46] Vile_: I think they'll just add more Rune Slots to Hands, Legs, and Chest.
[5:04:51] Jango_: they should, the same 3 slots would get boring
[5:04:55] spansonite1: towBANNED
[5:05:09] hammack52: i herd there was going to be 12 slots total be the time we get to 60
[5:05:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: letem cook
[5:05:43] wowking35: wowking35 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! towHAMUP
[5:05:53] EllisTheMenace1: i think 5 is enough slots
[5:05:55] brewtank: @Towelliee feral and rogue kinda weird with energy regen. weird with runes too kinda
[5:05:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: 12 rune slots they mean
[5:06:07] hammack52: yeah 12 rune slots
[5:07:00] Vile_: 12 Rune Slots (4 different runes per 3 gear slots, gloves, legs, and chest) makes sense.
[5:07:13] hammack52: i mean with the 12 runes per clas we have some classes alredy have like 4 or 5 runes in some slots
[5:07:29] brewtank: KEKW
[5:07:43] force_FMD: They need moar FRESH
[5:07:46] AzedaNA: Level banded content was fucking genius

[5:08:53] AnguishTM: I think it's good that they do it in phases
[5:08:53] Arocian: lol
[5:08:53] szeeman62: @towelliee how hard is blood dk to learn for a new tank?
[5:08:57] spansonite1: lol
[5:08:59] Alienfromger: LUL
[5:09:00] zhr0: lmao
[5:09:05] Arocian: LMAO
[5:09:16] brewtank: @Towelliee for someone who didnt want to 1-60 in 1 go. level banded god tier for me. i can level then log off or make alts and retail ibnetween
[5:09:21] Ultracane: good ol delayed gratification
[5:09:21] spansonite1: LUL
[5:09:25] Nate_Kay: theyve lost the capacity to enjoy the game, its just a mad rush to min max everything
[5:09:31] hammack52: i mean the level banded phases is pretty good but i think this 1st phase is lasting a little long at this point
[5:09:34] Gibsonex937: i'm about to move to wild growth crusader strike is full of idiots
[5:09:36] Coresmoke420: if i like it its mine tho lol
[5:09:41] Vile_: @szeeman62 Blood DK is not difficult to learn.
[5:09:59] hammack52: and this is coming from someone who has not even done the raid yet
[5:10:04] Screamnsteam: @hammack52 its been like a month lmao
[5:10:05] AzedaNA: Blizzard can see stats that we can't. The majority of the playerbase isn't even 25 still I bet
[5:10:12] smokinkills: @szeeman62 if u are used to tanking its easy
[5:10:12] farner1: i feel like its also catered to the casual audience.
[5:10:16] farner1: which is great
[5:10:22] TheUnknowing: im happy with the amount of time the first phase is taking, gives us plenty off time to level everything we want to level, get BiS in BFD etc
[5:10:23] Arocian: It's great how long it is. Been able to level up and try out 4 different classes/runes
[5:10:23] snake_like: people who got lucky/loot filtered think it's lasting too long. or got sergeant 2nd week. or got tons of gold "handed" to them
[5:10:36] szeeman62: @vile_ which xpac would you recommend for leveling a blood dk through dungeon spamming
[5:10:58] Nate_Kay: @snake_like streamers mainly, and theyre fuelling the perspective
[5:11:04] AzedaNA: They also have to stage content for 5 versions of WoW. They release stuff strategically

[5:13:16] Shrenko: first ever message = timeout LUL
[5:13:26] rymerre: classic shadowlands when
[5:13:28] Mckhero: i passed on classic for evcer an SoD made me interested
[5:13:30] Wulfgrym: players get games to play, company gets money, everyone is happy
[5:13:37] TheUnknowing: its probably cause of the emote
[5:13:40] brewtank: @Towelliee do they send classic legion or nah
[5:13:47] SpoofAvatar: shadowlands SOD
[5:13:51] Gibsonex937: after all the hype dies down they will just do a full reset from vanilla to wotlk again
[5:13:52] Technogre: I think everyone can agree we can skip WOD
[5:13:59] luckfore: if they do legion classic i quit retail for sure
[5:14:02] spansonite1: <3 PogChamp legion
[5:14:06] fewyn: let's skip classic shadowlands
[5:14:09] Boosti661: lets grind some AP
[5:14:16] brewtank: @Technogre i actually think a fast paced wod would be great. pve content is great
[5:14:19] brewtank: and pvp is nice too
[5:14:47] luckfore: legion classic marathon hypu
[5:14:54] brewtank: classic wod could be fast af
[5:14:55] Vaellder: assuming there isn't more grind in retail if/when legion drops
[5:14:57] Mckhero: stop at mop lol
[5:15:01] Rudric_Ice: I hope cuz it ain't classic
[5:15:08] Rudric_Ice: Not*
[5:15:09] Vile_: If they went Legion, they'd have to do two different iterations of M+...
[5:15:13] Vile_: I don't think they'll do Legion.
[5:15:22] Vile_: As much as I miss Legion and its heavy class fantasy influence.
[5:15:25] luckfore: legion came out 8 years ago jeez
[5:15:29] Aidler: I hope they do MoP
[5:15:31] Technogre: @brewtank faster paced yeah I could see it
[5:15:55] twarnak: They're already doing legion stuff in m+. Makes no sense to do the whole expansion over again. It would make more sense to scale the raids up to the current Ilvl and have a like sort of raid + stuff.
[5:15:58] tectus_17: what server are you on for your horde?

[5:16:42] hammack52: as long as people still play the game under the classic name they will keep pushing it forward
[5:16:44] digaboom: is the world soul saga some wild WoW 2 timeline multiverse reset?

[5:23:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: jimmy kimmel pissed at aaron rogers
[5:23:18] ambiotic: and now hes going to get sued
[5:23:18] Turco11: he said kimmel was on the epstein list
[5:23:25] Kaykerrs: Jimmy Kimmel threated to take him to court cuz he put his family in danger

[5:23:32] Outerlaw: ya jimmy gonna wax that ass
[5:23:37] Kaykerrs: Pat McAfee then apologized

[5:39:32] TheUnknowing: Yeah the private aura stuff is so shit
[5:39:46] ijuki: More private auras lol
[5:40:41] ambiotic: Prob have to redo the spell. which  they should do for fyrak anyways cause its complicated for no reason
[5:40:42] eatonaround: what is a private aura?
[5:41:17] Alaquane: buff or debuff that can't be tracked
[5:41:27] ijuki: Private aura = can't be tracked
[5:41:43] eatonaround: got it. thanks
[5:41:46] ambiotic: its a spell that does show a buff/debuff, so you make a weakaura that announces it to other players and then makes a rotation for it
[5:42:17] hammack52: lets phrase this right its a mechanic that can not be auto-maticly be tracked by an addon

[5:42:34] ambiotic: its just pushing a button when it doesnt need it, its a lame spell in an intermission and doesn't that complexity. If it was seeds or something sure
[5:42:51] ambiotic: doesn't need*

[5:43:19] dldrzoidberg: maybe this was the intention
[5:43:33] dldrzoidberg: to see how far they can go
[5:43:41] TheUnknowing: You know, dratnos if he really put his mind to it, his guild could do it Kappa
[5:43:46] ambiotic: no it wasn't intended, the spell is not that impactful. The part that does damage is the shield. Its not a meaty part of the fight at all
[5:43:47] thebakeriscomingforu: I'd like to see the devs move fights away from add ons, not more add ons
[5:44:22] dldrzoidberg: maybe they wanted to see how players solve this puzzle
[5:44:33] dldrzoidberg: and the macro was not tought by blizz
[5:44:49] hammack52: no i think that is pretty close to what they want, you have to interact with something rather than your addon just auto-telling you what to do with out your input
[5:44:53] ambiotic: You get a color and you can only soak that color, then slow down the orbs. You can do that without an addon
[5:45:15] PotbellyGoat: ah the classic experience
[5:45:21] jeff_blazos: you shouldnt'a done that
[5:45:26] Treevinal: he's just complimenting your tuaren "size"
[5:45:33] Curleaf: Some of the Horde on this server really seriouslt I've noticed..
[5:45:43] ambiotic: No, they didnt want to map out a rotation but you cant do it without the addon mapping out the rotation
[5:45:46] ambiotic: the orbs spawn too fast
[5:46:01] dldrzoidberg: but this was not done before so clearly they wanted to try something new
[5:46:02] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[5:46:08] falldrgn: just don't make the end phase a 1 shot if the seeds spawn?
[5:46:19] dldrzoidberg: a private aura on a intermission?
[5:46:38] ijuki: Private aura was a success, the actual fight was not lol
[5:47:03] dldrzoidberg: @ijuki but this is not the first time they  implemented a private aura
[5:47:03] TheUnknowing: definitely not a success
[5:47:04] ambiotic: All the abilities on the private auras needed to be gutted, it was not successful
[5:47:14] ambiotic: Smolderon was gutted
[5:47:17] dldrzoidberg: so why did they do it in a intermission?
[5:47:18] ijuki: @dldrzoidberg True true
[5:47:42] Osilon33: that run to xroads... dont miss it
[5:48:19] ambiotic: they have to, cause my guild is not going to be able to handle the addon coordination and its a dead tier lol
[5:49:13] rymerre: sounds like most of my relationships

[5:49:24] TheGiant99: How's the day
[5:50:03] geokouts: LUCKY 13
[5:50:06] dldrzoidberg: so how did blizz testers deal with the intermission?
[5:50:13] geokouts: sry caps...
[5:50:17] ambiotic: They didnt
[5:50:47] Nokterian: LuL
[5:50:51] ambiotic: That shit was not tested
[5:50:59] Nokterian: They went like fuck it we put it out this way
[5:51:09] Osilon33: that or we all suck at wow

[5:51:14] DrkPhoenix6913: sure they did, they turned on godmode :)
[5:51:17] falldrgn: world first no addon Fyraak
[5:51:20] chefdejour82: they just ran a AI
[5:51:22] ijuki: What if they did ... POGGERS
[5:51:24] Playermodd: they are with admin tools
[5:51:46] Osilon33: worlds first chat cleared Mythic Fyraak with no addons...
[5:51:49] ambiotic: Its for bugs, crashes, and other performance issues. THey do not run the fight on mythic with a raid team
[5:51:56] dldrzoidberg: so they had inflated ilvl and they zerged it?
[5:52:03] Alienfromger: tested with cheats
[5:52:06] Alaquane: it'll happen after war within, maybe midnight when people can solo the raid
[5:52:11] ijuki: I did mythic fyraak without playing WoW lol
[5:52:13] Nokterian: clearly saw how the design of those last bosses have become through the last patches
[5:52:49] mrwaddles22: BFD
[5:52:57] hammack52: its never going to happen for retail
[5:53:03] Dolphinwithfeet: it makes it less fun with all the data mining
[5:53:03] tankabito: Until abilities are clearly telegraphed like in FF we will use auras.  They design fights knowing we will make 100 weak auras for everything.
[5:53:05] ijuki: First tier of an expansion ... would be smart
[5:53:19] ambiotic: They would need to spend a year conditioning us for bugs
[5:53:34] falldrgn: then we end up with untested bosses like we did with Anduin and the Jailer and its a shit show
[5:53:35] ambiotic: Like they did with the level squish
[5:53:46] DemonicAngel318: Bosses shouldn't require add-ons to clear, full stop
[5:53:52] spansonite1: <3 towBleedpurple towByah bigtime!
[5:53:56] thebakeriscomingforu: I would love for abilities to be telegraphed in WoW like in FF14 and GW2.

[5:54:37] Dolphinwithfeet: what about letting testing happen but everyone has to be under and NDA?
[5:54:37] hammack52: if they do that the fights are either going to be so simple that mythic raiders are going ot be bored out of the minds
[5:54:54] hammack52: or no one is goign to be doign them till the addons catch up
[5:55:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: that nda would be broken within 5 minutes
[5:55:49] ambiotic: I do think they will start doing it with the last few bosses
[5:55:51] ambiotic: sooner than later
[5:56:00] Ordicos: casters are sitting there saying i think the boss will do something soon
[5:56:13] geokouts: skin :P
[5:57:17] TheGiant99: How did they raid before weak aura
[5:57:44] Plague_GG: the closest I can see them going is no mythic testing, and/or no journal until it‚Äôs killed
[5:58:23] RealPartyPhil: Taking your hands off your keyboard for flame wreath was hard for some
