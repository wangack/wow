[0:46:51] MrSapient: i can see it being either honestly
[0:46:55] jamarky23: Do you think its a pr stunt to make oscars more exciting again?
[0:47:04] Zippaya: so you done for like 30 sec :D
[0:47:24] skylaars: if that shit was staged, give will smith another oscar
[0:47:27] Kaype92: Will Smith lost a lot of respect after that
[0:47:29] Baldarsar: either way it was fucking awesome
[0:47:31] Thoreya: oh boy. might go back alliance
[0:47:34] kharnij83: made a joke about his wife having shaved head, but she has that cause of a disease she has
[0:47:36] WhiteKnight74648: So something happened yesterday?
[0:47:39] MrSapient: i think it was PR.. because they have had so bad rating over all the politic shit they were doing in the past few years
[0:47:49] kharnij83: doubt it was staged but they are actors so who knows
[0:47:58] WhiteKnight74648: Heard Will Smith pulled a Rick James on Chris Rock

[0:49:43] tonyr23: shit crazy
[0:49:59] Dagomarus: The way chris took that like a champ, you could tell that wasnt the first time hes been smacked for a joke LUL
[0:50:25] WhiteKnight74648: Chris Rock has a whole new level of profesionalism now in my opinion
[0:50:50] skylaars: either way, that was some good theatre last night.   slapping someone and then winning an oscar.  wild
[0:50:51] pixxelina: but he handled it quite well overall
[0:50:56] WhiteKnight74648: I don't think he could of handled it any better

[1:35:08] Armdel: fingers crossed for that in 10.0
[1:35:11] MoonwalkingAngel: world of peacecraft
[1:35:14] PadidinJones: that would really be pulling the ripcord

[1:50:31] falldrgn: 18% P3.
[1:50:31] Clicklesly: Yeah, having people travel to a venue nowadays seems really pointless ^^
[1:50:32] Warblade23: The comfort of home makes a huge diffrence
[1:50:36] bowsers1: i think Liquid dont care anymore LUL
[1:50:38] Gingerprimer: TBF for Liquid and Echo it is WF or bust
[1:50:38] falldrgn: *15% P3
[1:50:40] dimofodi: It isn't dying before this reset though. None of them have even seen the mythic only phase.
[1:50:44] bowsers1: world second is what ever
[1:50:49] OnePlayerPete: What's Project 60?
[1:50:51] Dagomarus: It depends on how they play and if they get their phase 3 sorted they doin some strange stuff
[1:50:51] SpeziConnery22: !wow10

[1:50:57] mrJhague: 19% P3 then there is P4
[1:50:59] Heero_Effect: Oh for sure I think liquid will still do it. But would be quite the upset if they didn’t
[1:51:05] Aquadriel: @Towelliee i dont think is pointless, but it is not sustainable
[1:51:06] Animalfitz: who actually got it i stoped watching
[1:51:06] xhaven: need more stamina
[1:51:07] mrJhague: P4 at 10%
[1:51:32] CuddlyWuddly: home ground advantage!
[1:51:40] Kisswani: didn't you saw BRF ?
[1:51:41] NecroTarkan: how was echo's set up for their event?
[1:51:45] Kisswani: say *
[1:51:45] dimofodi: I would say do 2 weeks of the actual mythic race on-site and then ship'em home on reset day if not done.
[1:51:50] Sephirothxz: Echo is just so good
[1:52:11] Dagomarus: I doubt we will see another 11 boss raid that was basically 2 raids in one again anyway so saying it might happen again is purely academic
[1:52:20] exploitedz: would be boring tho
[1:52:25] Heero_Effect: @necrotarkan echo had a great set up. Good commentators, fun events.
[1:52:35] dimofodi: How is Blizz supposed to show that they're going to fail one shot mechanics on Halondrus for 4 days though.
[1:52:51] Gingerprimer: The fact they also lost Scott was not great
[1:52:51] Razekiel83: Problem is Blizzard is tampering all along, it is like running at a course that changes length constantly.
[1:53:19] Rivanozz: Maybe these guilds should capped the event for only 2 weeks whether they cant kill it or not.
[1:53:39] CrimsonNurse: Isn’t this last raid a huge example that Blizzard has no idea how many pulls bosses will take?
[1:53:49] falldrgn: I wonder if Echo got anything for winning the race
[1:53:51] stjon13: I liked this raid
[1:53:53] Heero_Effect: @rivanozz nah that would imply they started at the same time
[1:54:15] Dagomarus: Yeah any instanced content that isn’t queue bases should work, part from the list of raids and dungeons
[1:55:05] CompleteRascal: got to say your tmog looks pretty cool
[1:55:06] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[1:55:11] dimofodi: Go home during reset hope for the best.
[1:55:21] magemaster225: you think nerfs come this reset or next reset
[1:55:45] HoganIs2Cool: thats how it should be
[1:55:56] pk99: People would play better from home
[1:55:59] HoganIs2Cool: its more authentic :P
[1:55:59] falldrgn: I think Naowh played way better at home
[1:55:59] misomander: this tier lasted longer than the last two combined
[1:56:05] Sephirothxz: Imagine if echo gets world 2nd after reset
[1:56:11] Heero_Effect: Ya but production wise it looks better having your casting team on site with the team
[1:56:16] handlebarswow: they should book 2 weeks at a venue and then go home for reset if it's not over by then. I don't want to the in person events to go away tbh 😓
[1:56:17] CanadianCataclysm: Man that was crazy last night at Oscars. Chris Rock said something about Jada Smith.. Will went up on stage and slapped Chris in the mouth. Then got angry at him.
[1:56:19] ottavianni: casting should be on location, the raiders at home
[1:56:20] dimofodi: Do they get the same production value for the casters if it's remote though?
[1:56:24] falldrgn: Echo could get world secopnd lol
[1:56:27] bowsers1: there would be less excitement about RWF if they play from home
[1:56:29] Rivanozz: And also the amount of splits these guilds doing in this tier are absolutely wild LUL
[1:56:36] Kisswani: POGGERS
[1:56:47] falldrgn: @Cataclysmmz You kn ow its a show right? all of that was scripted
[1:56:47] bowsers1: Pog
[1:56:48] Nibbel__: can you trade gold tho?
[1:56:50] PadidinJones: WF trade!! I was there!!
[1:56:56] TrixStar36: Europe has an advantage with the travel as you can pretty much get anywhere in Europe in 1-2 days without even flying
[1:57:03] Shrenko: what is 9-5 challenge @Towelliee
[1:57:39] flebbooo: people will find there ways KEKW
[1:57:39] Dagomarus: I think travelling to do it can be fun, you get to party after the victory, as long as your not there forever i think its a fun event to meet up for

[1:57:49] handlebarswow: in the in-person events shouldn't be ruined because of one long tier (which was spoiled by excess splits)
[1:57:51] dimofodi: Psssst need some gold? Meet me in Throne of Thunder!

[2:01:57] anseyoh: Any sportsbooks taking bets for RWF?

[2:18:44] merzicdh: yes. i'm waiting for the crying to happen with that
[2:18:48] Zeke_nl: you playing BDK now?

[2:20:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: You can craft one piece at first, then after awhile it will keep adding more creation energy to allow two, three, and four at one time
[2:20:07] Bacanu34: i mean if i get 4 piece i will like to play some of my alts , and get 4 piece on them as well

[2:20:18] Svendv: 3k flux it is ithink
[2:20:21] Svendv: or 1.5k
[2:20:24] Svendv: its only flux lol
[2:20:26] Bennodkk: you just need flux
[2:20:38] KragnosWoW: !9-5
[2:20:38] Moobot: @KragnosWoW The first goal of the subathon is the WoW 9-5 challenge! Towelliee plays WoW on a brand new account with no help and as if he had a 9-5 normal job. So only about 4-5 hours a day to see how far a normal person can really get in today's WoW
[2:20:44] MaxedLuck_: flux is so easy to get. im on a boosted 60 in 9.2, and got like 8k casually playing
[2:20:49] Clicklesly: I mean, if you're playing the game at all you should have at least 10k flux by now
[2:20:57] toobaked1987: That low of flux? I have like 30k
[2:21:09] akia03: and sandworn relic gear
[2:21:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's basically like putting an enchant onto the new gear
[2:21:21] Jarlan23: tf that sounds so good
[2:21:22] MarquisLek: there are some rumors going around that you can use sandworn gear to get lfr ilvl tier
[2:21:34] Jarlan23: is that this week!?
[2:21:38] salozzz: buy 278 boe and make it tier LUL
[2:21:50] JediNeo99999: @Jarlan23 April 12th
[2:21:51] KragnosWoW: !project60
[2:21:56] MaxedLuck_: @salozzz if you wanna drop $500 worth of wow tokens/gold lol
[2:21:58] akia03: yes you can
[2:21:59] pixxelina: @Jarlan23 april 13th in eu
[2:22:02] Bacanu34: yes you can
[2:22:24] MaxedLuck_: insanely cheap
[2:22:24] ar1ze_bg: are we gonna be able to upgrade the tier items
[2:22:28] Darthyrevan: lol so i have 25k what do i do with the rest?
[2:22:29] Colt_Engineer: that cosmic flux price is nice
[2:22:31] Jarlan23: so can you put a legs in there and get a chest tier
[2:22:31] snake_like: wait can I upgrade an existing piece?
[2:22:33] Lexi__Marie: my main has 40k from playing daily
[2:22:34] Amarlian: flux is very free flowing
[2:22:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cosmic flux is easy to get, that's not a problem, yeah
[2:22:34] akia03: have 45k of it atm
[2:22:35] Dragonsland7: 50k on my main, it's nuts
[2:22:35] Scoodles91: i got 50k :D
[2:22:36] Heero_Effect: I’m glad they are giving us tons of cosmic too for this
[2:22:39] TheCheeseWheel87: IDK, Spending all week doing LFR, and Normal getting no loot and then Vault giving me false hopes of a Tier piece only to give me the same pieces i got throught out the week feels bad man. RNG sucks and wish i could take my Anima and Cosmic flux and buy gear.
[2:22:42] Bacanu34: i have 35k on my main
[2:22:44] KragnosWoW: !p60
[2:22:45] pixxelina: 50k here too lol
[2:22:50] Darthyrevan: add a vendor
[2:22:55] magemaster225: yeah its on ptr
[2:23:01] Synonymous: sweet
[2:23:07] Lothawia: Thats in 9.2.5
[2:23:22] akia03: they need to add a vendor to spent flux
[2:23:23] TheCheeseWheel87: not to mention the 30+ mythic+ ive been doing.
[2:23:25] Milanesa_De_Pollo: What about the cypher gear?
[2:23:45] akia03: cypher didnt work on ptr
[2:23:50] Biotechz: that's one of the easier ones imo
[2:23:52] Svendv: this puzzle is like a mythic boss
[2:23:53] TDTPrem: You just have to find the 3 that dont match
[2:23:57] TDTPrem: 3 times
[2:23:57] Colt_Engineer: my addon can never solve that one
[2:24:01] MaxedLuck_: they should let you convert cosmic flux to Sandworn Relics at a reasonable rate
[2:24:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: This puzzle you basically look for 3 that are similar, or 3 that are very different
[2:24:22] akia03: sandworn relics are easy to farm tho
[2:24:39] MaxedLuck_: how so akia? i must be missing out lol
[2:25:00] toobaked1987: Please remog your helm towelliee I am triggered
[2:25:08] akia03: you join akkiris the rare grps he drops 11 per kill and repeatable
[2:25:24] MaxedLuck_: interesting, ty! gonna try that
[2:25:34] rbailey_2222: day after my bday
[2:25:39] Thoreya: prepatch hints?
[2:25:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[2:25:42] akia03: and if you have skinning a easy couple 100k

[2:25:56] Heero_Effect: GivePLZ TakeNRG GivePLZ TakeNRG
[2:26:01] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee They want to do it in 9.2.5 so ppl can do something during the drought and until 10.0
[2:26:04] reggiepowa: how long until 9.2.5 releases, was it like 3 months usually for ptr testing?
[2:26:09] gfvaris: echo doing press conference post race stream having a bit of problems should be in a bit
[2:26:30] Cracksun98: i have 262 pally tank and 2300 io and they still dont invite me to 15s lmao
[2:26:34] Biotechz: quest from cyphers
[2:26:35] Lexi__Marie: how long do you think we have to complain for them to increase genesis mote drop rates
[2:26:39] Thoreya: ya its bad

[2:28:38] Senthius09: yea you need to invest in the proper cyphers to get the quest
[2:28:53] akia03: you did the first one on that row the second one unlocks it
[2:29:03] Dragonsland7: Blowing up chickens with helm of Domination, best mission ever

[2:29:08] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!

[2:29:44] kappaday23: Kappa
[2:29:48] Biotechz: the one thing about the cypher that is nice, is if you already unlocked the ones that take 3-5 days, it only takes 1 sec on your alts

[2:29:51] thiccsushi: Oh shit I thought it was acc wide the whole time KEKW
[2:29:51] reggiepowa: did you tank tazavesh streets, does it seem overtuned on fortified?
[2:29:52] akia03: im just happy they removed the cd for alts
[2:29:55] Volkien: Yes, I thought so too, Why do they keep doing that?
[2:29:59] Aquadriel: cypher is kinda useless for alts tbh, problem was the 16 fucking timegate.
[2:30:00] asharnia: gotta make sure you use your time playing their game xD
[2:30:09] Anneris1: cosmic flux should be transferable to other characters i have 95k on my main
[2:30:09] onybear: Schematics too
[2:30:11] Heero_Effect: @skeechlol 10 has no release date
[2:30:13] Varkarus: less time playing again lol
[2:30:14] Jarlan23: if they dont make most things in 10.0 account wide im gonna be disappointed

[2:30:16] PraxicThorn: why do they keep doing that NotLikeThis
[2:30:19] magicmanxo: METRICS
[2:30:19] Clicklesly: The rewards should've been BOA i guess

[2:30:24] magicmanxo: people logged on for longer
[2:30:32] Kinghorn: schematics dont really matter, the mats to make them are bind on account
[2:30:57] akia03: you can repeat kill them for rep
[2:30:58] Aquadriel: you get 1 WQ worth of rep from rares.
[2:31:01] Lexi__Marie: i just want to farm genesis motes and not have it feel like a chore
[2:31:02] Zeke_nl: it is useless. the zone is good for 3 wq's a day then leave LUL
[2:31:04] thiccsushi: @Jarlan23 They won't that is something they are dead set on for some reason while every game nowadays just does it
[2:31:05] Jarlan23: you know what would make me log in for longer? not having to grind my alts
[2:31:09] Aquadriel: akia03 no you cant.
[2:31:15] JD_26: Is wow down for anyone else?
[2:31:23] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Did you get the thing from the jiro in front of the cave where Firrim is, where you get 50% more cyphers??
[2:31:26] Aquadriel: No, thats fake news, you only get once a day.
[2:31:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think rares only drop one rep troken per day
[2:31:35] akia03: @Aquadriel thats how i grinded to rev
[2:31:36] Clicklesly: At 10 rep per kill that might take a while Kappa
[2:31:37] Jarlan23: i would literally play the game a lot longer if all i had to grind on my alts was gear
[2:31:38] rsimpson105: @Towelliee I assume there's been plenty of people brining up Chris Rock getting the shit slapped out of him at the Oscars

[2:38:02] Biotechz: that one that has 3 days remaining is what you need, so you need to wait @Towelliee
[2:38:03] magemaster225: so when that green circle finishes in 3 days you can do it
[2:38:03] Jarlan23: whats the research one that gives an extra world quest

[2:57:31] fewyn: liquid plus?
[2:57:38] TeKRaJGaming: Crazy how a "dead game" gets that many viewers for an esports event.
[2:57:40] kami5671: Lol ehat are u talking about
[2:57:45] trillbill412: I've seen 6+/- hrs
[2:57:47] dranet11: echo esports had way more than the liquid stream, always
[2:57:48] Sebell777: U sure? Pretty sure scripe+echo stream had more than max+liquid
[2:57:48] KaisenSiru: Yeah Echo production was top notch
[2:57:59] Hypertitan: that's unfortunate...I love watching max's stream over the main channel
[2:57:59] trillbill412: @Shirey36 6+/- hrs
[2:58:04] AureliusXV: you think they need to win next one for liquid to keep them on?
[2:58:05] TheNoidd: it wasn't even close most days
[2:58:08] DecayedmiNt: @Mint_Fanatic That's on them tho. Im just saying it's normal for people to take mental health over competiting. Take a look at Dev1ce for example. Or Gla1ve in the past. Mental is more important in Esports than anything. If you arent there mentally, you arent competing at your best
[2:58:15] dranet11: they did

[2:58:21] TeKRaJGaming: Preach did SO WELL on commentary
[2:58:26] TeKRaJGaming: Dratnos did too
[2:58:31] BelacKriv: the echo casters were good;the liquid stream ui was god tier
[2:58:32] Therman75: cause max pov is best
[2:58:34] Undying_Unicorn: I really think they presented the race as a whole better, rather then just they're team
[2:58:34] kami5671: Ye they did towel
[2:58:39] tubbylicious: i feel watching max or other players is better then the main channel
[2:58:41] thasch: overall viewership or like the Org twitch channel? Echo's main channel was pulling around 30K more than liquid - but yea overall viewership Liquid had way more if you add all of them
[2:58:44] Korupcija_: it's 'cause they benched Gingi
[2:58:44] Its_Me_MG: who ever was ahead, had the larger viewership, its always been that way and it will always be that way.
[2:58:45] Heero_Effect: Max had like 40k all day no?
[2:58:55] Colt_Engineer: I mean honestly I can't stand commentary when I can just hear their comes directly
[2:58:58] AureliusXV: i watch driney alot
[2:58:58] CannonM2K: thats true
[2:59:04] Colt_Engineer: coms*
[2:59:04] dranet11: echo had echo esports, scripe and gingi whilst liquid just had the liquid channel and max
[2:59:06] morp1onz: Gingi had more viewers than Echo main stream
[2:59:08] Traexler: Also depends if you find the casters annoying or not
[2:59:08] KaisenSiru: And yeah, I preferred Max's stream over the Liquid channel
[2:59:09] Hypertitan: I watch echo main stream for preach...love that guy
[2:59:17] Blvdman: My issue now is can you consider Esports, really Sports? Here me out.. In regular sports you have people who can help train and condition you for the physical aspect. Esports seems more mental, how exactly would one hire a coach to condition the mind? Anyone with insight on this? Much appreciated.
[2:59:17] xFevers: People want to hear comms though. they dont want to hear the casters commentary
[2:59:26] comp1: watermelon
[2:59:28] Heero_Effect: @mint_fanatic stop attacking people
[2:59:30] Undying_Unicorn: i lot more were streaming then that Dranet
[2:59:32] cromedogg33: liquids main channel lineup was terrible though
[2:59:39] Ekazz: <3 Hi chat :) Can't logging in WoW RN, I guess i'm not the only one :) ?
[2:59:45] akia03: if you select your self while clicking on the mob u can get al 12 from same mob
[2:59:46] Korupcija_: @xfevers then why did echo channel have most viewers
[2:59:52] Amarlian: Nah, Caster commentary was great too
[2:59:57] Evcon_: i didnt watch liquid channel bcuz i didnt want to hear the commentators
[3:00:03] Amarlian: Comms only would be borning
[3:00:12] Blvdman: When he put his stream into sub only mode, i knew he was out
[3:00:14] Ertra: caster commentary on liquid was annoying... they didn't talk about the raid at all, they were just bullshitting
[3:00:15] Eizenhart: Eizenhart subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[3:00:28] magemaster225: I think he was getting sick of the meming when they were behind
[3:00:35] jaysteea: cuz max and mike are the big personas of both teams
[3:00:58] Blvdman: @Ertra there's only so much you can talk about when they wipe to the same shit 100+ times lol

[3:01:06] xFevers: @KaisenSiru IDK i didnt watch Echo's channel so i dont know how they dealt with it. I know most people like Liquid because their chemistry and comms are so funny
[3:01:32] Sebell777: U guys dont think It was pretty bad for liquid as a brand that max had all the people watching?
[3:01:33] feherlofia123: where will the reveal of new expansion take place ? youtube ?
[3:01:36] akia03: does method still have a arena team?
[3:01:36] SkypexOnline: Maybe its because Liquid change names so many times? Limit, Complexity Limit.. now Liquid.. we dont even know what comes next
[3:01:47] KragnosWoW: welp the race is over now which is what the people wanted
[3:01:59] Blvdman: ^ tru

[3:02:53] Hypertitan: Method's performance is so crazy to me

[3:03:19] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[3:03:25] Dathas487: @Blvdman Trill is back AWC wrapped Sunday
[3:03:28] dopieGG: e-Sports PogChamp
[3:03:32] TheLoho: It's not confusing at all
[3:03:36] Gurtogg: so many still calling it limit
[3:03:36] Hypertitan: Liquid will stay for a while I'm sure...Max is part owner in Team Liquid now

[3:03:41] Colt_Engineer: so is it limit liquid? KEKW
[3:03:41] AureliusXV: did yo know magic johnson invests in liquid @Towelliee
[3:03:46] DecayedmiNt: @Blvdman In terms of esports teams, they hire mental health coaches. Evil Genius's Dr. Alok for example.
[3:03:46] Blvdman: @Dathas487 oh shit AWC is over? lmaoo i missed everything
[3:03:49] Heero_Effect: Max is rich af
[3:03:58] PotatoWin: its easy E=Mc2
[3:04:11] MuttonChopins: I didnt knew Liquid was Limit, thought it Liquid was new Method or a new Mythic World First guild
[3:04:19] Blvdman: @Blvdman Oh interesting, didnt know that
[3:04:29] gregl__: if thats confusing to someone then idk how they function
[3:04:33] xluckydawgx: That show is stupid good
[3:04:36] Blvdman: err hmm this reply function broken
[3:04:48] AureliusXV: and the creator of AOL @Towelliee  they got money KEKW
[3:04:51] Colt_Engineer: or is it liquid limit? KEKW
[3:04:53] miguelapple: lmao exactly same players xDDDD
[3:04:54] cromedogg33: I had no clue they switched until I saw max with the liquid tag
[3:04:54] Kinghorn: some people are slow
[3:05:01] dopieGG: @Towelliee if you were a Dev at Blizzard, what would be your next big Warcraft idea?
[3:05:07] TheLoho: They even kept the first two letters the same for slower folks
[3:05:09] MuttonChopins: I haven't been keeping up with WoW stuff lately
[3:05:19] LethalSquirrel: never seen twitch throw 8 ads at me in a row...ouch
[3:05:20] Blvdman: @Mint_Fanatic Interesting didn't know they hired mental coaches. Is there like an off season for them to continue to strengthen mental fortitude or its just an at the moment coach for when they hit the tournaments etc.
[3:05:41] phranklyn_zgz: @LethalSquirrel I got hit with 9 I feel ya LUL
[3:05:42] Heero_Effect: @lethalsquirrel lol
[3:05:58] Hypertitan: @dopieGG Not directed at me...but I think player housing and all races can be horde or alliance would be so awesome for me
[3:05:59] xluckydawgx: Oh the casting is perfect for it, John C Riley as Jerry Buss is great, we got lucky it wasnt Will Ferrell like it was supposed to be
[3:06:10] trillbill412: once they down Jailer, you won't see Max online for two weeks
[3:06:19] dopieGG: @dopieGG man that would be awesome.. <3
[3:06:22] Jarlan23: overwatch league teams have them too
[3:06:42] DecayedmiNt: @Blvdman Mhm, a lot of the esports teams in other games usually live together and practice daily, ect.
[3:06:42] dopieGG: @dopieGG are you currently playing, Hyper? or on a break?
[3:06:48] c0mmander_starscream: E-Sports dudes need shrinks? WAT?
[3:06:53] Gurtogg: theres only one WoW event every year tho
[3:06:54] epicjester: I heard that Echo brought a guy in for the first time that race and they killed it next pull. I can't imagine being the person benched for that. That can't feel good.
[3:06:59] Hypertitan: @dopieGG I just started playing again
[3:07:11] dopieGG: @dopieGG Horde or Alliance? ;O
[3:07:24] Dathas487: The worst take so far has been about the race's length. Do ANYTHING for 12-16 hours a day, for weeks in a row.
[3:07:25] Blvdman: @epicjester at that level, a win is a win regardless
[3:07:27] Jarlan23: i wonder what they do for carpel tunnel
[3:07:29] Arch0ntas777: nice dragon mount
[3:07:31] trillbill412: those guys were raiding 12+ hrs a day after flying cross country
[3:07:33] warrior_nick23: i do that everyday LOL
[3:07:33] Dathas487: It's mind numbing on so many levels
[3:07:34] Jarlan23: their wrists have to start cramping right?
[3:07:34] Hypertitan: @dopieGG Horde...but I so want to play a dwarf.
[3:07:38] c0mmander_starscream: They should just all smoke weed
[3:07:50] TheLoho: It's like the Olympics kind of. Except the athletes have to compete in every event @Towelliee
[3:07:55] dopieGG: @dopieGG I feel that. I really wanna come back, I just don't know if I'm ready.
[3:07:55] Korupcija_: idk, I feel like gamers get used to that
[3:08:15] atmfees: they got there before H week
[3:08:18] AureliusXV: its not like theyre alone though
[3:08:27] c0mmander_starscream: All those chairs have to be burned with napalm
[3:08:27] Hypertitan: @dopieGG I was the same....the RWF brought me back.  And I can't stay away from my enhance shaman for too long :P
[3:08:33] paulson14: maybe shrooms. like gingji was talking about lol.
[3:08:37] preten: LoL Worlds tourney usually last for about a month and span across multiple countries.??
[3:08:37] AureliusXV: i travel for work
[3:08:39] Colt_Engineer: sounds like a vacation for me
[3:08:42] extrnl2: your normal home comforts and food
[3:08:49] Wholoveswaffles: Yeah they were there from like the 28th of February
[3:08:50] dopieGG: @dopieGG 100% -- Which server you on, if you dont mind me askin?
[3:08:51] toobaked1987: Towelliee I have been deployed and dunno if I could mentally handle 16 hrs a day 18 days wiping
[3:08:52] Shirey36: boot camp
[3:08:56] nokeycs: no one forced them to be at the event
[3:08:59] trillbill412: @Korupcija_ there's a difference between gamers and those guys. Playing THAT long everyday as a job/ livelihood takes a toll
[3:09:06] Hypertitan: @dopieGG I play on Mal'Ganis
[3:09:06] Blvdman: Even just raiding twice a week for 3 hours on Sire Denathrius prog burnt me enough to quit lol
[3:09:08] xHILDAx: Dude we just had so many lockdowns for MONTHS. I bet  2 weeks without talking to your mom / friends will be fine
[3:09:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's high stress with so much pressure on them
[3:09:12] Brizhann: Would you ever consider being a caster for RWF?
[3:09:12] c0mmander_starscream: Just give them hot pockets and mountain dew they will be good
[3:09:20] AureliusXV: @nokeycs KEKW
[3:09:23] xFevers: OMG bunch of 1Head takes here
[3:09:23] dopieGG: @dopieGG BRO! That was my old Horde server for YEARS. Hell yeah, MG <3
[3:09:26] icerasta: Being a veteran and no stranger to being away from family, even  2-3 weeks away is really really hard on mental state
[3:09:28] MOLAR305: @Brizhann they cant afford towelliee

[3:09:48] TheLoho: @xHILDAx yeah except you aren't expected to PERFORM at the HIGHEST level to WIN a RACE.
[3:09:48] Heero_Effect: I mean it’s true…I know naowh went home after a few days being there and raided at home
[3:09:49] Hypertitan: Man, I can't explain how much I hated sharing rooms with people when I was working out of town for weeks and/or months
[3:09:53] themadbunny275: lockdown brain\
[3:09:54] TheLoho: You just sat on your ass and watched netflix
[3:09:58] danpire: everyones depressed lol
[3:10:00] trillbill412: I'd like to see 99% of this chat try to do what Liquid did and not have some issues mentally or physically
[3:10:03] BelacKriv: Also, being in front of a stream   / camera the whole time can be really draining

[3:10:09] Sir_Onionknight: The problem is when you are with a team, nobody wants to speak up and be like "I can't do this anymore" and be "THAT GUY" when the whole team is relying on you.
[3:10:14] KragnosWoW: u heard it here folks
[3:10:15] Colt_Engineer: @trillbill412 where do I sign? KEWK
[3:10:16] jerexify: @Towelliee I think it's more jealousy. People are upset that others who play games for a job are complaining about work. They don't want to understand that it's still a job.
[3:10:18] Hypertitan: and it doesn't matter if I like the person or not.  Sharing rooms with even a friend grinds on me
[3:10:20] pixxelina: I am so tired of this argument
[3:10:29] c0mmander_starscream: lol I was still working during lockdown
[3:10:38] dopieGG: "my mind is fine" is the biggest lie we tell ourselves in the mirror.

[3:11:06] rikkalovesu: for someone that's new to the game what would be your top pieces of advice?
[3:11:07] paulson14: raid from home.
[3:11:11] paulson14: ya
[3:11:22] Blvdman: I'm not surprised at the shit takes, regular sports fans have similar takes too. When people see you getting paid to play sports its like they don't teach the athletes as people anymore lol.
[3:11:23] LethalSquirrel: wow that hurts Towelliee...i work as a complainer and you are attacking my profession... Kappa
[3:11:23] AureliusXV: i really dont think liquid has a chance anymore against echo imo
[3:11:25] TheLoho: @Towelliee I think the pressure of having to actually WIN and having a huge region cheering you on compounds the issues of being away from home too.
[3:11:26] CapsuleCorpEmployee: Is there a reason for them to be in the one room? I see no benefit from it lol
[3:11:27] Moobot: Fugazi811, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[3:11:29] oblaatmonster: The days of LAN are dead, sit at home with your dog and race that way.
[3:11:32] c0mmander_starscream: They all should just Zoom from home Race to Worlds First
[3:11:33] AureliusXV: echo is a welloiled machine
[3:11:33] miguelapple: naowh, jimmy stayed at home. still world first.
[3:11:34] MOLAR305: @Towelliee I didnt hear your take on Matt Ryan to the colts, how are you feeling about it?
[3:11:35] howlingstorms: So true @towelliee people these days don’t get it
[3:11:36] Dqob_: I watched Naowh from home and it was nicer than watching someone in the a “gamer hall”
[3:11:38] trillbill412: stay home, be at your own chair and desk, sleep in your own bed and it'll do wonders for the mental health @Towelliee
[3:11:38] Mitune: It was such a shame that logistics hurt Liquid so much
[3:11:38] dopieGG: LAN events are awesome, but not at the expense of an entire teams mental health.
[3:11:41] Shrenko: it creates hype I guess
[3:11:42] arturiuss44: It should be like the superbowl teams they get to bring families or friends to event and rent houses instead of hotels maybe.
[3:11:45] paulson14: all raiders will be on fiber anyways
[3:11:47] c0mmander_starscream: I mean its an MMO FFS
[3:11:48] Korupcija_: I think it's fun for 7-10 days
[3:11:57] AureliusXV: its cool to play with friends though

[3:12:20] asmo_daios: wow is down for 6 hours @Towelliee ? "(
[3:12:24] Blvdman: lol wow esports is like going to a sleepover at your friends house. It's dope af the first 2 days, day 3 onwards you start finding the flaws and wanna dip lol
[3:12:32] brewgamingtv: lol
[3:12:34] Ordicos: RWF i always think they trying to make it like a LAN party
[3:12:35] snoogs123: they don't have superbowl money
[3:12:41] Heero_Effect: @aureliusxv I mean she is hot I’d stay home too
[3:12:41] MOLAR305: husband's and wives and kids maybe, but parents and granparents... not happening
[3:12:44] SkypexOnline: Gingi's waifu would go
[3:12:46] dopieGG: Looking for a good replacement for Sailor Jerry's Rum (for Rum & Cokes). Got a recommendation?
[3:12:46] Hypertitan: would they pay enough for your family members to not work tho??? haha
[3:12:51] kharnij83: parents r not gonna miss work for that
[3:12:54] raptorstrick: It’s not fun.  Try deploying for 6 months.  I get being away from families.  So I get it
[3:12:55] Dqob_: They would have to take time off work etc it’s not really possible, football players are paid millions they can easily afford it
[3:12:56] rikkalovesu: for someone that's new to the game what would be your top pieces of advice?
[3:13:00] Gurtogg: shade world first in 10.0

[3:13:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: the thought of going to boston depresses me

[3:13:17] Shamwise: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:13:20] AureliusXV: i play games and make a living
[3:13:28] jarilrpg: @trillbill412 most of them do....

[3:13:56] paulson14: drunk raiding ftw

[3:38:46] morp1onz: Spitting facts, after another one
[3:38:47] reggiepowa: that would kill heroic raid though
[3:38:49] Onisekai: it should almost all acc wide
[3:38:50] flebbooo: Yep true! its about that time
[3:38:56] PrimalRain: if more was account wide I'd play so much more
[3:39:02] pixxelina: the problem I see with valor not being capped is people getting burnt to a crisp, trying to max out everything
[3:39:02] RuggedRender: agree, either that or aproach it as xiv does it, everything in one character
[3:39:04] Broomba: that woulsnt kill heroic raid -- lol

[3:39:42] Melgor101: True
[3:39:45] danimoto10: you tested already the cross faction?
[3:39:46] Banjo586: i feel like a cap on valor spent on a single char each week would still be needed to ensure m+ doesn't make heroic raid pointless
[3:39:46] ThePwnageDoctor: Hey man what's the Towelliee insider info on next expansion? :)
[3:39:57] danimoto10: lol
[3:39:59] noway137: Except i feel like with lost ark especially that the sole purpose of alts is for silver generation
[3:40:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: The cross-faction is cool
[3:40:12] Jarlan23: i noticed whenever i get burnt out from WoW and need to take a break its because i start trying to play my alts
[3:40:14] noway137: sole purpose of alts down the line*
[3:40:14] Zippaya: even more, I would try multiple alts, now only main and maby 1 alt and thats it
[3:40:17] Mitune: able to talk in game?
[3:40:25] Amarlian: I assume the gold trading is for selling runs? @Towelliee
[3:40:28] reggiepowa: you still cant trade gold cross realm
[3:40:28] Dyasis: @Mitune  only if they are in your group
[3:40:29] danimoto10: coolll
[3:40:29] Tripl3dot: lol
[3:40:30] Jarlan23: so now im just gonna one trick my main and thats it
[3:40:33] Sloppy_Nachos: Are you on EU right now?
[3:40:35] danimoto10: going to the vod lol
[3:40:37] Dragonsland7: LUL
[3:40:39] jones9: Valor should be capped early on and become uncapped with the half patch like normal
[3:40:39] chaosjoshua: they need to bring back the dungeon armor sets  and weapon mogs from the prior expacs
[3:40:43] Mitune: at least its something @Dyasis
[3:40:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: He'll pop back up

[3:41:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: If we have to wait another year for 10.0, there's no excuse for them not fixing all this stuff
[3:41:53] snake_like: a restriction called spaghetti code
[3:41:55] Thoreya: im shocked they were able to do the cross faction shit so quick
[3:41:55] Onisekai: Wait! they already make a new engine for wow?
[3:41:56] ClinicallyCasual: probably a pretty dumb question, I unsubbed from wow last january (2021) after getting burnt out I do want to try the next expansion sahould i wait till after it releases to get back into the game or ahead of the launch what do you think?
[3:41:59] jones9: All other currency yes should be for all your toons yes I agree with that
[3:42:02] Garthben: PTR?
[3:42:17] PrimalRain: they are constantly tweaking the wow engine
[3:42:17] Zettabyte: Overwatch 2 Kappa
[3:42:25] noway137: Is it even possible to make a new wow engiine without making WoW 2.0? @Towelliee
[3:42:36] ItsEddieAU: half of the stuff oldschool runescape players want can't be done because of the shitty old engine LUL
[3:42:36] TheLoho: They made one new engine and had to choose between Overwatch 2 and WOW10.
[3:42:37] SensationalBanana: Currencies, reputations would be awesome if they were account wide, like in GW2.
[3:42:38] Dashuria: wasnt ow2 announced 4 years ago
[3:42:41] gunit2624: sup towellie how are u doing?
[3:42:45] Mitune: Bronn Cena
[3:42:54] AlphasaurusRexx: @ClinicallyCasual play the game when you want to play the game?
[3:42:58] snickletoe: all reasons i havent played wow in about a year.  burned out. ill go back someday...when they fix that account wide bs
[3:42:59] Onisekai: How even? i dont think they can just put the game on a new engine. It must be already back then planned
[3:43:11] Shrenko: @ClinicallyCasual I took like a year break too and just came back for 9.2 . Im really enjoying it actually, love the new zone and raid. I switched up my spec and went survival hunter and having alot of fun with it. Im just chilling farming achievements when Im not doing m+ or raids and farming stuff in the new zone
[3:43:16] Killuf: servers down? i cant connect

[3:52:57] chinfu303: confirmed towelliee wants to have sex with baine
[3:53:00] Pritamin: you have that in the venthyr club management itis horrible
[3:53:09] Komly: it doesnt rly matter who you get rep with, they need to fix the how to get rep
[3:53:09] snake_like: blizzard needs to do what they used to do best and just steal lost ark systems and make them way better
[3:53:15] Jarlan23: i want ff14 style reputations. the beast tribes in that game were awesome to do
[3:53:17] MuttonChopins: did Baine do anything this expansion?
[3:53:21] ItsNobbie: WoW's mechanics are dated and can't compete with modern Action MMOs
[3:53:33] mercydante: what do u need for flying in zerith?
[3:53:38] pixxelina: as soon as one gets exalted with Khagdar, they get Atiesh in their bags Kappa
[3:53:40] dright424: They have all those unused colors for older sets they could use that as rewards for world events in old zones
[3:53:51] Banjo586: wow combat is timeless
[3:53:53] Shrenko: just add the copium emote allready towelliee
[3:53:53] maros_petrus: its called Adventurer of Zereth Mortis
[3:53:54] Orirholim: World of Warcraft has the smoothest combat compared to other MMOs.
[3:54:08] Cafe0le: @Nobbie01 wow combat is goated specially in pvp
[3:54:08] Mitune: If you can say, is Blizz hearing the type of advice you are saying ie taking from others than mainly @Towelliee
[3:54:09] Heero_Effect: FF14 though?
[3:54:12] MuttonChopins: wow combat is really good, WoW and wildstar are still the best combat with BDO

[3:54:25] Orirholim: FFXIV has slow combat.
[3:54:33] Jarlan23: ff14 doesnt have responsive combat. tbh i thought the combat in ff14 was one of the weakest parts of the game
[3:54:33] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[3:54:34] Orirholim: They need to remove that combo system.
[3:54:35] Hypertitan: some of the systems might be considered "dated" maybe.  but the mechanics as far as dungeon/raids are pretty good
[3:54:36] Komly: ff14 doesnt accumulate over 200k viewers on twitch spread over multiple streams
[3:54:40] Komly: for 1 event
[3:55:02] Banjo586: @Komly asmongold had 200k viewers on his ff streams LULW
[3:55:12] toobaked1987: No more system, I cant take learning WoW every two year HALP!!!!!
[3:55:16] Heero_Effect: @komly true if it’s not big in twitch no one cares about the game
[3:55:17] Thoreya: id rather not have ff14 combat changes onto wow. systemically maybe for like account wide stuff
[3:55:23] ItsNobbie: the whole MMO genre is outdated actually
[3:55:30] mercydante: 10.0 surely will release this year
[3:55:33] ItsNobbie: except Action MMOs
[3:55:34] Folgrum: covenant 2.0 here we go ;)
[3:55:35] Draz3nx: When do you think the new xpac  will be released ?
[3:55:38] snake_like: nahhhh, they tried to tweak torghast with TONS of external feedback and still kind of fucked it up
[3:55:44] snipsfan: wows combat is amazing IMO. but need more account wide currencies and reps etc for alt friendliness. cross faction stuff, more arenas and bgs, more dungeons, better world bosses and world events. lots of room for improvement which is a good thing IMO.
[3:55:51] Cue_Killar: Adventure tome is already kinda a thing though right? its just achievements per zone with no rewards in WoW
[3:55:57] a23pk: a23pk1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[3:56:10] PrimalRain: plus new mmos don't want to take risks, because of fear of failing
[3:56:12] ContraRob: I don't think that's true, look at some innovation from Lost Ark, and that game is relatively new (3-4 years old)
[3:56:15] Orirholim: I can't even think of another MMO that comes close to WoW combat. Maybe Neverwinter.
[3:56:24] gfield2k: can't log into my account ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[3:56:25] Evolutious: wait.. how is Towelliee in game? Aren't servers down?
[3:56:31] Enraig: Same could be said with any genre. That's why it's a genre lol
[3:56:35] Thoreya: i mean look at the FF hype. streamers went to play a couple months and now it relegated to the means
[3:56:45] ContraRob: Adventure tome, Roster, Islands
[3:56:50] nightmayor12: @evolutious PTR
[3:57:05] Zavier420: Adventurer of Zerith Moris gives a mount
[3:57:06] snake_like: I like what they did with darkshore and arathi highlands in BFA. They just need to improve upon it A LOT. More unique rewards, less RNG, always available, etc
[3:57:14] noway137: I don't think tome is that innovative
[3:57:28] Evolutious: @nightmayor12 ooo thank you
[3:57:32] NoWaayMan: didnt realize there was gonna be a maintenance period today
[3:57:35] kokochris: @snake_like the legion invasion was really fun and was continous
[3:57:39] ContraRob: They didn't invent, they innovated
[3:57:52] ContraRob: That's what I mean, it's an improvement on something that already exists
[3:57:56] themadbunny275: ffxiv wonderous tales
[3:58:28] snipsfan: one of the good things about Shadowlands being "so so" is that alot of us played other MMOs and found out what we like abd don't like. now we can maybe better communicate to blizz what we sre looking for.
[3:58:30] ChaosRage98: @ContraRob innovation != improvement..
[3:58:32] kyr_slowbro: It's like flavors of an ice cream, at the end of the day it's ice cream, but people like 1 over the other
[3:58:38] toobaked1987: Yo, this login server is totally wonkers!
[3:58:46] Banjo586: LULW
[3:58:47] pixxelina: :D
[3:58:49] Blvdman: lol
[3:58:49] dopieGG: 20 STAR CITIZEN KEKW
[3:58:50] Mitune: originality vs innovation vs improvement
[3:58:57] oRiie: Blizzard's strong suit isn't innovation it's taking something someone else already did and making it better; all of their major franchies follow this model minus Diablo
[3:59:08] gfield2k: Why are they doing maintenance on Monday ?
[3:59:08] PrimalRain: ryzom had something like the node system, but nobody played that.
[3:59:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: that would be a great vegas bet, what releases first ashes or star citizen LUL
[3:59:16] deadalon: Blizzard need to stop the hard resets every expansion.  Allow something from the early expansion have a meaning in the current content.
[3:59:20] zackmcquack: that's a good thing, blizzard getting inspired by other games makes the genre better
[3:59:20] snake_like: lmao 10.0 just has stagger and weakpoint mechanics and every class ability is revamped
[3:59:22] Shrenko: I havent seen any updates on that game in a while now
[3:59:37] dopieGG: they post stuff somewhat regularly on Twitter
[3:59:40] dopieGG: (Ashes)
[3:59:42] cleansed_kusa: they do a video chat every month
[3:59:45] DecayedmiNt: SC at least gets updates, SC's issue is the CEO has too many systems being made
[3:59:46] Hypertitan: last i heard was the unreal 5 update
[3:59:49] pixxelina: they are hiring right now, all I ve seen
[3:59:59] legendesi: they're still changing some stuff to UE5
[3:59:59] ItsNobbie: Blizzard is THE copycat of the branch - their own achievements were just Diablo & RTS
[4:00:03] dopieGG: Man.. imagine an MMO done in Unreal 5. good lord it'll be a beauty
[4:00:09] nchester51: hard to swallow pill almost all kickstarter mmos just funnel money to 1 guy and not actual development lul
[4:00:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: i played a free weekend of star citizen once, i spent like an hour trying to land my damn ship
[4:00:24] GreenOut17: they swapped to UE5 recently, probably a ton of engine work being done right now.. nothing to show yet
[4:00:29] Banjo586: @oRiie I would argue M+ was the only actual innovation WoW has had in a long time and it's their biggest player retention feature right now
[4:00:39] Mitune: What about Lost Vikings Madge
[4:00:40] Nokterian: towStop towIt
[4:00:43] Heero_Effect: Daddy?!
[4:00:46] Metrii: @nchester51 Don’t all companies funnel money to a few people?
[4:00:49] Eternalmirz: bnet server still down?
[4:00:55] Nokterian: i come in stream and made me use stop it right away LUL

[4:01:04] legendesi: Albion Online
[4:01:10] Jarlan23: cube world Kappa
[4:01:20] PrimalRain: is albion popular though>

[4:01:38] dopieGG: what about DreamWorld PogChamp
[4:01:39] oRiie: Warcraft by itself is a complete copy, design was improved from Ultima and Everquest; the entire IP was copied from Warhammer
[4:01:40] Ascendor81: TROVE
[4:01:41] Hypertitan: it's got it's own following
[4:01:43] questroo: albion on mobile too
[4:01:44] Mitune: its successful enough
[4:01:47] Rilix: the cubeworld hype when that first got shown was insane and then it just vanished
[4:01:51] MuttonChopins: 8k playing on team right now
[4:01:53] Shrenko: Albion is really popular, its even on mobile
[4:01:55] ChaosRage98: @Nobbie01 if you use that argument then RTS wasn't their "own", they copied others before that, SC just happened to be the BIGGEST
[4:01:55] josephrt10: ravalations fall flat on eu and na
[4:01:56] GreenOut17: is pantheon still being worked on?
[4:01:59] legendesi: it's for a niche and has a constant new players

[4:02:28] Nokterian: Kickstarter was something years ago not anymore.
[4:02:30] Perremin: @Nobbie01 Don't forget Asheron's Call 2. Some of the Vanilla WoW talent trees directly copied portions from AC2.
[4:02:32] ContraRob: Albion has a ton of players on their launcher
[4:02:37] Niksen_99: Knob Creek vs Four Roses? @Towelliee
[4:02:37] Shrenko: yes, crossplay with PC
[4:02:46] Bear_Mange: albion is able to be played from anywhere
[4:02:49] JoeOven: if WoW is so good then where is WoW2? Kappa
[4:02:51] KozIsTall: so WoW will be down until 12 est?
[4:02:51] Hypertitan: I had intentions to go back to newworld but I think I just hard quit that game.  Can't muster the want to play for w/e reason
[4:03:05] Heero_Effect: DansGame HSCheers
[4:03:12] ShowDUH: @KozIsTall no 3pm est
[4:03:14] Bear_Mange: crowfall was bought out?
[4:03:14] theDirtyon3: terrible purchase KEKW
[4:03:22] KozIsTall: 3pm ? EEWWWW , ffs
[4:03:26] KozIsTall: is that classic as well?
[4:03:30] Nokterian: Years ago i did fund games because the dollar was cheaper than the euro that is not the same anymore.
[4:03:32] kokochris: once flat.. very hard (not impossible) to fix up
[4:03:33] dopieGG: 3K!?!? PogO

[4:04:18] theDirtyon3: some puzzle sover LUL
[4:04:28] Mitune: Thats so sad to see LUL the addon to just solve that. I get it but still
[4:04:32] Blvdman: No one likes PvP mmorpgs, at least the type of whales companies want to attract arent interested in pvp lol
[4:04:33] Velashen: Bless online failed multiple times I think it takes the cake
[4:04:39] ArcaneSyntax: what the fuck is crowfall
[4:04:51] Ascendor81: "Zereth Mortis Puzzle Helper"
[4:04:56] Nokterian: So many mmo's have died in the last 10 years
[4:04:58] theDirtyon3: @Mitune after youve done that puzzle 10 times tell me its not necessary
[4:04:59] Shatraugh: Rift FeelsBadMan
[4:05:02] Mitune: exactly @ArcaneSyntax
[4:05:09] Mitune: Oh I know @theDirtyon3

[4:05:13] Heero_Effect: FailFish
[4:05:16] papaherc: wildstar
[4:05:21] Phantomstrk: *cough* star citizen..millions and millions of dollars kickstarted to a game that isn't even released yet after years and years
[4:05:22] dopieGG: WildStar
[4:05:27] pinguNoot93: @Ascendor81 Thx
[4:05:30] Nokterian: towF wildstar
[4:05:33] JoeOven: Crowfall can't hold a candle to Pigeonrise
[4:05:35] Ralvay: I believe 99 of 100 MMO game developers never played mmo before in their life. and that is the problem.
[4:05:39] fewyn: i highly regret kickstarting star citizen
[4:05:45] deadalon: Amazon game COE fired today.  Says alot about the situation in Lost Ark and New World
[4:05:46] Mitune: Id do the same just sad to see something sorta fun get reduced to it @theDirtyon3 Just doesnt work when having to do multiple times LUL
[4:06:03] Nokterian: Star Citizen will be in alpha forever
[4:06:18] extrnl2: lost ark doesnt have a situation i dont think...
[4:06:21] arturiuss44: maybe their doing UE5 so they can be on PS5 and PC
[4:06:23] Moobot: Oskuz1, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[4:06:24] Blvdman: Wasn't the CoE fired cuz his contract is up anyways?
[4:06:29] extrnl2: maybe some minor twitch/youtube drama but who cares
[4:06:32] Heero_Effect: @deadalon what’s the lost ark situation?
[4:06:33] candyshopowner44: What’s up towelliee ? How u doing playa
[4:06:34] GiveLoveLive: What play Lego you running?
[4:06:39] GiveLoveLive: Pally
[4:06:39] deadalon: Game is loosing players faster than Elden Ring :D  -30% every month
[4:06:39] mobbo: @towelliee he was popular on the Jersey Shore
[4:06:43] darkeagle7561: you know, the "situation"...
[4:06:47] Jamdawg: there is no situation in lost ark. just some PTW andy's that are trying to create a situation
[4:06:50] noway137: i saw he stepped down, not fired

[4:07:03] theDirtyon3: wtf lol
[4:07:19] Blvdman: Oh if he stepped down, even more plausible, his contract was up and prob got a better offer somewhere else
[4:07:27] Heero_Effect: I mean I don’t play lost ark anymore I got bored. But seems like most people enjoy it still
[4:07:28] cronladd: tru
[4:07:29] bowsers1: it's because Asmongold did it on live LUL
[4:07:34] snipsfan: you don't need to rush in lost ark. just play the game at your own pace. enjoy it.
[4:07:38] Gebirges: Money doesn't matter in WoW. Skill matters. Without skill you won't kill a boss.
[4:07:43] FreeguyDH: What you think about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock?
[4:07:47] Gebirges: hi Towelliee btw, been a while
[4:07:57] extrnl2: as twitch and youtuve viewers we tend to wildly overrate the impact of the opinions of the people we watch
[4:08:04] Hypertitan: paying hundreds of dollars to incrementally increase 1 item is absolutely insane to me that people actually do that haha
[4:08:10] PraxicThorn: you don't even need to, it just gets you there faster obviously
[4:08:12] smashwow: "need" to is subjective
[4:08:14] Blvdman: @Gebirges money matters in wow, I quit wow cuz i couldnt afford legendaries because the activities I enjoyed doing didn't make money lol
[4:08:15] Heero_Effect: Well to be fair asmongold is always right
[4:08:19] deadalon: There are news that Lost Ark will be investigated in US because of buisness model.  CEO is leaving for a reason.
[4:08:22] kharnij83: i love the people who post daily on the forums explaining how this game is dead like we give a shit
[4:08:24] Ascendor81: im almost 1340 F2P, at 1337 right now..
[4:08:36] afp9900: Whats the countdown for ???
[4:08:41] Dyasis: @deadalon lol
[4:08:49] Rizec: @Blvdman what have you been playing instead ?
[4:08:50] Blvdman: truuu
[4:08:53] extrnl2: yeah im ~1350 and ive only bought crystalline aura
[4:09:20] josephrt10: does asmon still plays lost ark ?
[4:09:21] extrnl2: i also have wayyyy too much free time atm so there's that
[4:09:22] Ascendor81: i just used the free crystaline aura since start of game... but i can see $10/month for the benefits of it,
[4:09:35] noway137: @josephrt10 yes
[4:09:37] largefromage: EZ other peoples money
[4:09:40] critartist: i've played 497hrs my highest il is 1040 but i have 6 alts at 500-540 ish
[4:09:55] Blvdman: @Rizec I quit wow back in june 2021, so far just been leveling up IRL, playing PoE, Grand Chase(nostalgia childhood game), started lost ark recently.
[4:10:08] Ralvay: I spend 60 hours to get "only" one trinket and still I don't have it. I could farm gold in that time and buy full hc run with that. something wrong about wow too..
[4:10:10] snake_like: hit 1355 today after taking a 2 week break and skipping a day here and there. doing islands, events, chaos dungeons, and guardian raids -- it's very generous
[4:10:22] Rilix: i got to 1340 and have been stalling waiting for the rest of my friends to catch up, but they got in the stalled period breaking out of t2 and have started to just quit because of it

[4:10:31] dadbanger1: its your money spend it how you want nobody else should be concerned with what you spend your money on
[4:10:33] Blvdman: @Rizec honestly mostly watching Towelliee  and quin69 as well when bored
[4:10:37] Rizec: @Blvdman good choices man personaly lost ark is not for me but good going man

[4:10:53] kharnij83: my money is my money ill spend it where i feel fit to. to many people worry about everyone is spending their money on
[4:11:04] TheNoidd: and at least a player is the one rendering the service rather than Blizzard being like here is your shit
[4:11:07] Zzorski: @Towelliee what gunnar optiks are you currently wearing? I really like that style!
[4:11:13] Blvdman: @Rizec Yea trying not to spend money on games anymore. I'd prefer games try and convince me to pay than for me to pay them to play their game lol
[4:11:18] Mitune: Well WoW pvp gear is the same in essence to honing just no chance at least
[4:11:23] Mitune: at least thats a plus
[4:11:23] deadalon: I would consider Lost Ark a decent game if it was just properly balanced for moderate pricing.  Game would be much better if it was just sub based with real money and it would also prevent alot of the bots
[4:11:26] sycnessx: the problem to compare them is the power gains are not JUST from gear... theres engravings, cards, etc.
[4:11:28] xVoLLi: servers down today?
[4:11:34] josephrt10: imagine if wow had tera gear system
[4:11:34] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[4:11:42] thgcm: is wow off?
[4:11:48] Phantomstrk: yeah some kind of 6 hour maintenance on login servers not to be confused with maintenance tomorrow
[4:11:52] KronasKG: Do you need a seperate key to play on EU servers?
[4:12:03] azukh1: Hey Towellie, do you have any tier gear/set bonuses yet?
[4:12:13] Rizec: @Blvdman ye hopfefully that are game soon again that are worthy of that :)
[4:12:13] JoeOven: now the bots are in the lore
[4:12:17] Banjo586: wow boosts can give you gear but the content isn't gated behind gear, it's gated behind ratings and performance in the game, gear boosts won't get you into a mythic raiding guild

[4:13:29] noway137: And I think coming from OSRS, you need to understand that it's a F2P game, you will never eliminate all bots
[4:13:31] Waldron27: 6 hour maintenence on a monday, blizzards literally have zero braincells... what a joke
[4:13:38] TheNoidd: you've got no flux left to give
[4:13:42] Thoreya: @Waldron27 ....

[4:13:51] snake_like: can you upgrade existing tier gear in the creation catalyst?
[4:13:57] KragnosWoW: u doin project 60 on retail or classic?
[4:14:06] Bernardo994: still cant get in.  thank god i had gold to resub instead of paying real money

[4:15:51] Schamanskii: its better than wow for sure
[4:15:52] Waldron27: well do it on a tuesday then like normal

[4:16:56] ShadowDMG6969: Did Echo beat the Jailer???
[4:16:59] Banjo586: Method recouped pretty well
[4:17:05] mobbo: Except Liquid doesn’t care about 2
[4:17:06] noway137: And Skyline isn't too far behind either @Towelliee
[4:17:08] JediNeo99999: Max has said before they don't care about anything but #1
[4:17:20] Thoreya: i think liquid has a real problem overcoming tough situations
[4:17:27] Thoreya: when the going gets tough they struggle
[4:17:28] arturiuss44: it says method at 19.4% 3rd phase
[4:17:29] Naturalbeef: I have a feeling Liquid falls apart after this
[4:17:29] silvabaq: i could see liquid pulling a Uunat and jsut call it a race.
[4:17:30] Shrenko: yeah I feel like Method only can go up from here
[4:17:31] DecayedmiNt: Just shows how good Sco is at his role.
[4:17:37] TheUnknowing: well it was any ones game for number 2 when liquid announced they were taking a break
[4:17:43] theDirtyon3: @Naturalbeef no shot
[4:17:59] JiberishUI: this PTR?
[4:18:01] Shrenko: @Naturalbeef nah, they just got bought by Liquid org lol
[4:18:16] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:18:24] phranklyn_zgz: @Towelliee I want BDGG to get NA 1st that would be amazing.
[4:18:32] Waldron27: Sco isnt the raid leader tho is he?
[4:18:34] Thoreya: im worried players might leave liquid for other good guilds
[4:18:43] Gebirges: i hope they do
[4:18:48] noway137: i think all their teams quit
[4:18:50] Banjo586: Method fell apart just as they were gathering momentum
[4:18:52] geokouts: Btw when the preorders will start after the the new Expantion anouncement?
[4:18:52] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Spires of Ascension +15 Mythic Plus Key - Protection Paladin (Shadowlands Season 3) youtu.be/xQL7lmYnZ-Y
[4:19:09] Naturalbeef: This is what I'm saying @thoreya
[4:19:10] theDirtyon3: @Thoreya liquid pays them the most i doubt it
[4:19:16] BullDevil: Didn't Sco just basically take a top 25 guild and essentially bought it out and branded it as Method? Still cool that they are where they are, but its not like he grabbed 25 randoms out of thin air
[4:19:21] dracullus: could be 5 minutes
[4:19:34] mobbo: Prolly immediately
[4:19:36] Gebirges: Either they start preorder on the day they announce it or at gamescom
[4:19:37] mercydante: any guesses on the release date?
[4:19:43] j2oss: why would you preorder lol
[4:19:43] dracullus: they had no problem starting SL preorder year before launch
[4:19:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: pre-orders will be big money
[4:19:52] Dionaut: This is on eu right ?
[4:19:53] mobbo: They always let you preorder when they announce digital at least
[4:19:54] zantos2020: I won't preorder anything from Blizzard, I made that mistake on Diablo II
[4:19:55] GiveLoveLive: Everyone convinced it’s dragon isles??
[4:19:55] ugubugu_: prepatch on christmass
[4:19:56] sragon13: 2022
[4:19:57] Drew_Diligence: Shadowlands pre-prder happened the same same day as the trailer announcement in 2019
[4:20:01] Gotxiko: they not giving release dates, but they might be aiming for Q42022
[4:20:02] mmo_kenna_: Sco must have some tenacity to rebuild after what happened, this RWF theyve had some of the best production and even have a female player on the roster which is good
[4:20:04] DecayedmiNt: It's a very rare fish
[4:20:05] galifax2: Hirukon is a pain to get out LUL
[4:20:06] morp1onz: I heard they can`t announce a pre-release if it doesn`t come out this year
[4:20:07] Gebirges: Hiru?
[4:20:09] Gebirges: Pog
[4:20:16] Shrenko: @j2oss for the collectors edition??? its normal to pre-order a wow expansion
[4:20:19] xire78: you fish up the lure and then make it and it is a 1 time use
[4:20:20] NoWaayMan: 99% of the people fishing arent using the right lure lol
[4:20:22] galifax2: You need to go all over the place to get him out
[4:20:28] mobbo: @morp1onz you are being lied to
[4:20:29] theDirtyon3: because it takes like 8 hours to get him out if you follow the fishing guide
[4:20:31] xire78: it does show up in group finder
[4:20:31] j2oss: collectors edition lol
[4:20:39] BullDevil: Season 4 killed all chances of expac this year, yeah
[4:20:44] Waldron27: id say march or april 2023
[4:20:50] Pritamin: takes like 2-3 hours to get the bait, and then you can fish him up for guaranteed mount
[4:20:51] kimmo_gaming: I think it will be announcment for new exp, new class, maybe some features, thats it
[4:20:52] Fundy31: it will be march/apríl 2023
[4:20:53] Naturalbeef: March 2023
[4:20:54] thetruegodofwarr: Its a whole fishing extravaganza to spawn him
[4:20:55] Colt_Engineer: I want them to take their time and make a great game instead of rushing it out
[4:20:56] Folgrum: i hope next XP will have 3 raid tiers, not 2 like SL
[4:20:56] Gotxiko: can see them delaying it, but if they give any dates, they might try to say "hey, 2022! (but maybe not)"
[4:20:56] Mitune: They shouldnt either. Literally Q3 next year if necessary to make the best expansion they can
[4:20:59] dracullus: @mobbo not true, maybe even SL was only one don't remember so far, but for sure BfA/Legion/WoD didn't have pre-order on reveal day
[4:21:02] fewyn: esp since they said they were bring WOD dungeons to m+
[4:21:08] smashwow: hiro is a fishing activate. you gotta get the goop thing then you have a chance at spawning it @Towelliee
[4:21:10] azukh1: ye no chance, remember Shadowlands beta started in April/May 2020. look how long that took until release
[4:21:11] GiveLoveLive: Really hoping for a new class? What are the chances?
[4:21:13] Gotxiko: probs feb/march 2023 i agree though
[4:21:16] MuttonChopins: im surprise they annocuned season 4, didnt think they would do a seson 4
[4:21:16] daddical: season 4 does look neat tho lets not gloass over it lol
[4:21:16] mmrghost7: damn will is angry
[4:21:18] fewyn: there's no way they'd do that much work for a short time frame
[4:21:20] KragnosWoW: season 4 sounds so residentsleeper imo, ill definitely take a break from wow when its out
[4:21:31] BullDevil: With season 4 being all the raids combined... expac could be June 2023 for all we know.
[4:21:31] ven49: Theyll do WOTLK at end of the year for hype then expansion at start of year
[4:21:38] Heero_Effect: Lol yeah once heroic Jailor is done I’m done with WoW
[4:21:47] smashwow: it's easily a Q2/Q3 2023 release with S4 being announced
[4:21:47] Banjo586: more residentsleeper than no content at all for a year?
[4:21:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: We need Classic Wrath sooner
[4:21:55] Gotxiko: nah summer 2023 is too late
[4:21:59] Gebirges: @Heero_Effect bye have fun :)
[4:22:00] Splashdownn: how are you online right now? that's cheating :P
[4:22:08] Gotxiko: s4 lasting 6 months at most
[4:22:16] MILESkg21: 6 month season OMEGALUL
[4:22:18] JediNeo99999: Season 3 also just started
[4:22:24] Orirholim: @smashwow It if takes that long, WoW is going to take a huge population hit again. Yikes.
[4:22:24] TheSabin: 9.2.5 feels like when Siege of Org got Flex raid mid-tier
[4:22:36] smashwow: @Orirholim that's every xpac
[4:22:46] Splashdownn: damn
[4:22:47] smashwow: S3 lasts until about September.
[4:22:50] Waldron27: S3 will last till prob sept?
[4:22:52] Shrenko: give it a try :)
[4:22:52] Mitune: Wish it was more like Throne of Thunder or Blackrock Foundry instead of just SL raids but a first step is a first step
[4:22:54] Waldron27: or aug
[4:23:04] crashoverride_gaming: yeah im logged out...cant get in
[4:23:07] smashwow: so 6 months after that would be the earliest
[4:23:13] Orirholim: July or August yeah
[4:23:15] Gebirges: Season 3 will probably end at the end of August
[4:23:34] mmrghost7: i actually dont want new season
[4:23:36] Mitune: possible Woltk beta
[4:23:42] Gotxiko: i never manage to get into beta lol
[4:23:43] bowsers1: WOLTK too
[4:23:48] NVbrutal: race to clear all 3 raids lol
[4:23:49] cerealkillas22: theres no race
[4:23:52] Dionaut: ginjii already said they will hold a event for echo
[4:23:52] Gotxiko: u.u wotlk while s4 might be
[4:23:55] Phantomstrk: RWF for what..for bosses that have already been killed....that makes 0 sense
[4:23:57] smashwow: i really hope the alpha is out by then
[4:23:58] KragnosWoW: season 4 should come out with wrath classic
[4:23:59] cleansed_kusa: wow off?
[4:24:14] BullDevil: Probably will see some good charity events happen in S4 amongst the top guilds
[4:24:15] FancyJTS: max has said there will be something but not a RWF thing.
[4:24:15] Waldron27: when wotlk classic comes out im 100% done with retail
[4:24:17] TheCheeseWheel87: Season 3 till end of june, Season 4 till October/November and then December pre patch event for Jan. 2023 launch.
[4:24:24] dracullus: it would be as exciting as classic 'world first'
[4:24:31] cerealkillas22: blizzard isnt even doing a hall of fame or anything for it either
[4:24:37] Gebirges: I want the mines :(
[4:24:42] MILESkg21: Depot > Docks any day
[4:24:42] Mitune: excited for its future potential less about what actually in season 4
[4:24:45] noway137: I thought Shadowmoon was cool
[4:24:48] stratiss: vote everbloom and ubrs please and thank you
[4:24:54] GiiGa07: i hate irondocks lol
[4:25:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah we need to all vote UBRS
[4:25:06] Banjo586: depot and docks currently
[4:25:06] GiiGa07: LUL
[4:25:12] TheRiwen: I did hate all dreanor dungeons
[4:25:15] Gotxiko: but they already said that no hall of fame or competitive would be up for s4 iirc
[4:25:15] ThePwnageDoctor: If shards of domination come back for season 4 I will not play it... I hated that shit.
[4:25:20] warrior_nick23: @Towelliee how are you playing na servers are down
[4:25:42] cerealkillas22: Grimrail and Iron Docks are still winning, UBRS is 2% behind Iron docks though @Towelliee
[4:26:02] KragnosWoW: Prayge
[4:26:16] Shrenko: @warrior_nick23 he logged in before it went down
[4:26:23] Mitune: Wait this a Christian Minecraft server? Thought this was WoW Kappa
[4:26:25] cerealkillas22: I hope UBRS overtakes Iron Docks
[4:26:25] Dionaut: @warrior_nick23 He was on before the work started. WHich let him stay in.
[4:26:33] ArcaneSyntax: I'd prefer auchindoun over iron dicks
[4:26:35] cerealkillas22: I like UBRS
[4:26:39] Frozen_DK: grimrail & docks <3
[4:26:41] ArcaneSyntax: I love grimrail tho
[4:26:44] josephrt10: imagine time walking vanila dungs haha
[4:26:44] Kisswani: yeah , but straight forward isn't exactly great M+ material
[4:26:47] Gravydipped: how long till wow is back up?
[4:26:56] Stormrazer78: You like wow again @towelliee
[4:26:57] KragnosWoW: thats how i feel about all of the dungeons
[4:27:09] cerealkillas22: I just dont like iron docks cause it has such a similar aesthetic as grimrail
[4:27:13] cerealkillas22: and the last boss is annoying
[4:27:25] garyoldmann: garyoldmann subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[4:27:32] Tokies: it's a lot of RP though
[4:27:35] MILESkg21: are they actually adding M+ to older dungeons ? or is it just a great troll
[4:27:39] Savagedave: morning towel man
[4:27:39] ItsPurgo: bfa with the portals made all the dungeons more complex was so fun I miss that
[4:27:40] azukh1: shadowmoon burial grounds hype!!
[4:27:44] Gurtogg: Where is venari are they still in korthis
[4:27:53] Banjo586: energy regen pocopoc
[4:27:58] Tokies: it's confusing
[4:28:08] therotkiw: his summon button gets a heal or attack
[4:28:12] Kisswani: @MilesKG21 Yep , 2 Draeonor dungeon , along with Kara and Tazavesh from SL
[4:28:13] cerealkillas22: I wonder what they are gonna do about the artifact relics that drop in return to karazhan, and if they are instead going to add some weapon drops and stuff to return to karazhan
[4:28:23] griffdog125: anyone having log in issues can't even get past log in screen just get dc'd
[4:28:29] MILESkg21: @Kisswani NICE PogBones
[4:28:37] Nevindaz: you can also asset mounts and other skin stuffs to your robot pet
[4:28:37] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[4:28:38] cerealkillas22: Yea i feel sure
[4:28:39] Stormrazer78: Good time to restart wow or wait 10.0?
[4:28:51] griffdog125: nm it's the stupid server maint.
[4:28:53] Gurtogg: we already have legion mythic back, and they removed relic drops from that
[4:28:56] ArcaneSyntax: the last row, the dps one is bonkers, poco doing 10k dps.
[4:29:11] Heero_Effect: IGN guide?
[4:29:14] thomaspxo: I really hope loot is just tokens for 9.2 gear
[4:29:23] thomaspxo: buy whatever you want
[4:29:27] fowlentv: is he playing on eu rn?
[4:29:33] Gurtogg: legion timewalking is in couple weeks
[4:29:33] KragnosWoW: well thats no fun
[4:29:38] kokochris: @Stormrazer78 probably fine if you want to build up new toons, learn new specs. just go in relaxed, no need to worry about rushing
[4:29:40] Nevindaz: no more 2 leggos? Sadge
[4:29:45] Everbliss: @Towelliee I don't raid but I do have the return-to-WoW bug. Is 9.2 worth it for me?
[4:29:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Surprise, you can't play the game right now!" Thanks, Blizzard! lol
[4:29:59] ThePwnageDoctor: Wait, is it confirmed there aren't dom shards for season 4??? :)
[4:29:59] 91Niki: Heyy Towelliee and chat towHi
[4:30:10] Nevindaz: only 1 leggo ? Sadge

[4:31:10] Khlaro: towOny
[4:31:13] Orirholim: aren't they going to bring it up to season 4 item level?
[4:31:15] Heero_Effect: HSCheers
[4:31:15] KragnosWoW: do they though?
[4:31:20] fowlentv: @weirdo_dude oh ok ty
[4:31:41] cerealkillas22: If they put in affixes like volcanic or some shit i refuse
[4:31:49] Kisswani: if they can make upscaling work , it'll be the greatest thing ever
[4:31:49] Gurtogg: transmogs, fun, loot
[4:31:52] Stevoh310: theyve shown they suck at scaling though lol
[4:31:57] Gurtogg: enough reason to do them again
[4:31:59] TheFlavius34: TheFlavius34 subscribed with Prime. 
[4:32:01] dracullus: somehow? they do it with dungeons every season
[4:32:05] Orirholim: grievous raid affix, let's go
[4:32:14] Rastailian: @towelliee Colts hired John Fox as defensive coordinator. Thoughts?
[4:32:15] Banjo586: +30 mythic painsmith
[4:32:28] MILESkg21: Tyrannical Nathria LuL
[4:32:30] Kisswani: I prefer bringing the raids to our power level instead of bringing out power down
[4:32:33] ThePwnageDoctor: Is it confirmed that there aren't dom shards in season 4 yet?
[4:32:34] Nevindaz: fates yeah
[4:32:40] Lupusdeus: would love if scaling worked to be able to go back to throne of thunder and other older raids as current content
[4:32:48] Gebirges: WH OMEGALUL
[4:32:48] Lupusdeus: used to be broncos HC
[4:32:51] Nevindaz: john fox KEKW
[4:32:52] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee what are you thoughts on josh allen leaving?
[4:32:53] assman_ny: Denver
[4:32:54] kharnij83: LOL denver/bears
[4:32:56] Dagomarus: not gonna lie, im just exciting to do some boogeying down and sasheying left
[4:32:58] ArcaneSyntax: I don't think I want the scaling shit all the time, it's fun for the last season of an expansion though.
[4:33:01] kharnij83: prepare for a boring ass defense
[4:33:09] MILESkg21: def going 0-17 this season KEKW
[4:33:13] gfield2k: Was in the Denver system, think he was the coach
[4:33:14] gali5656: Most the reason i hate timewalking is my playing my character feels like shit, so if its more of the same with the older raids f that
[4:33:16] Jobu12: CArolina panthers before Denver
[4:33:17] kharnij83: he cant
[4:33:42] thetruegodofwarr: This quest is annoying
[4:33:46] Gebirges: i still can't get over the fact that the Jailer on mythic died on the day the Lich King 25 heroic fell - just 12 years later.
[4:33:48] KragnosWoW: As will be in the playoffs this season
[4:34:16] Heero_Effect: @gebirges lol for real?
[4:34:17] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion announcement date 4/19 and other exciting dates like WoW Mobile - Check it out! https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1500894944474501120?s=20&t=PgfuLeF2nRsESPGtuvNnbw
[4:34:17] MrButterBear: why do people dislike the current wow compared to classic?
[4:34:33] raldrik: yes that is true
[4:34:34] therotkiw: now if I can get past the realm list
[4:34:37] MILESkg21: monkaS
[4:34:39] KragnosWoW: HE KNOWS
[4:34:40] Gebirges: @Heero_Effect yeah, couldn't believe it myself
[4:34:45] Kisswani: that is kinda cool
[4:34:52] josephrt10: bfa time walking when ?
[4:34:56] ArcaneSyntax: wow scaling still feels better than FFXIV level scaling, which just doesn't feel good.
[4:34:57] mavericks312: colts need to sign pat peterson
[4:34:58] KragnosWoW: any actual fact check on that
[4:35:01] Gurtogg: method got to 19.1% now :D
[4:35:02] Gebirges: @MrButterBear just too many systems that feel bad
[4:35:15] lithium364: better not to go on twitter or any forums tomorrow with the sylvanas ending coming up, people will mald out
[4:35:16] mandarinetip: how are u playing? I cannot login.
[4:35:24] noway137: 1 upgrade away from getting my 2nd toon to T3 in lost ark :)
[4:35:34] KragnosWoW: whens project 60
[4:35:35] kokochris: @mandarinetip had to login prior to maintenance on the login servers
[4:35:36] Nevindaz: it will be hard for them to adjust that.. imagine enabling the artifact systems for those who want to experience the true legion experience.. or coruption.. etc
[4:35:39] KoalaTeaTime: it helps to find someone else doing it so the cd on the item isnt so bad
[4:35:46] Besanth: Has there been any difference to WoW after Microsoft acquired Blizzard?
[4:35:53] ahrs1988: anyone else not able to login to wow?
[4:35:56] Dagomarus: im guessing the affix's will be like like torments and blessings work in torghast, some buffs and some debuffs, different adds, and mechanics and such
[4:35:58] Zavier420: Are the US servers down?
[4:36:03] ShadowDMG6969: So RN it seems Survival Hunters actually were the way to go in the Raid WTF
[4:36:04] ArcaneSyntax: @Besanth that hasn't happened yet
[4:36:06] Gebirges: @ahrs1988 Login servers are down.
[4:36:13] happybooger: i cant wait for the Mage Tower to come back tomorrow
[4:36:15] mandarinetip: smh
[4:36:23] moa285: SMOrc No
[4:36:24] MILESkg21: Alliance Scum WutFace
[4:36:26] Kisswani: POGGERS holding hands
[4:36:28] Zansteh: power of friendship
[4:36:37] kokochris: https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1508156908816973824
[4:36:37] 91Niki: Invite gnomes just to kick them Kappa
[4:36:37] Gurtogg: i cant wait for tauriwow to release their legion server, their mop server is so high quality
[4:36:41] ahrs1988: it says servers are gonna be down for 6 hours? the heck
[4:36:42] per1973: If you target yourself after you examine, then you can redo it.
[4:36:44] Nevindaz: I dont understand why they dont make servers for each expansion ..
[4:36:58] Zavier420: @91Niki lol
[4:37:02] MILESkg21: Gnome Punting Party KappaHD
[4:37:03] MrButterBear: @MrButterBear the only thing I didn't like was the new weapon systems. it made all those rare weapons we farmed for completely useless, nothing more than trans mogs
[4:37:05] Tokies: no more for the horde. now it's "for azeroth"
[4:37:11] Kisswani: oh god , Gnome warrior tanks WutFace those battle shouts
[4:37:12] kokochris: just posted the link to the sched. message.
[4:37:13] Gebirges: @Besanth They haven't yet. But the overall mindset has been very positive and the devs have been pumping content out and been way more open.
[4:37:26] griffdog125: can't even log in which sucks
[4:37:29] Besanth: I played this game for 1 month in Dec but I must say, as a new player, the story makes 0 sense. Anyone has any suggestions on how to make it less confusing?
[4:37:29] Waldron27: sos tupid.
[4:37:30] Gurtogg: he knows POGGERS
[4:37:31] Shrenko: they are preparing POGGERS

[4:40:21] KingSlayerYotam: huh that was a weird tone to talk about that gnome towLewd
[4:40:24] dopieGG: @Towelliee is there a Hammer Squad guild we can join and play?
[4:40:27] doomkry: i think with sylvanas gone, calia is going to be the undead racial leader

[4:42:24] sethgoodtime: Open hand slap, Guess you could say Paper Beats Rock?
[4:42:25] Besanth: Ahh okay. Thank you! Will check it out. This game drags me in so much cause the world is so beautiful and diverse. It's just the story being all over the place really confuses me and it makes me hindered from playing much @Kisswani
[4:42:26] 91Niki: It's not ok to hit someone. But if that was my so talked to like that, I'd also be fuming
[4:42:26] Jaxerath: Rock was mixing up words, might've been concussed
[4:42:28] BrutalHermit: Smith is a pussy
[4:42:28] lalelusa: Khadgar was observing a vowed to himself not to get involved after he worked his ass off in Legion only for things to go shit in BfA

[4:42:50] noway137: @Jamdawg and then got up to accept the oscar, awkard LUL
[4:42:53] geokouts: Years now there is a decline in viewership and SUDDENLY this happend :P
[4:42:53] Dagomarus: i think the first thing you do is get his wifes name outta your fucking mouth and go to commercial.
[4:42:54] kokochris: Will should have used the line "what did the five fingers say to the face..."
[4:42:56] kharnij83: khadgar sucks
[4:42:59] sifer007: KEKW
[4:43:00] Gebirges: @KragnosWoW he hurt Will's wife's feels with his talk; Will jumped in to be nice

[4:43:18] Bernardo994: yes hes an ass hat
[4:43:20] Gotxiko: he couldnt make it to shadowlands i think, just seeing through the raven
[4:43:20] Calphurnious: khadgar dreadlord confirmed
[4:43:21] Kisswani: @Besanth yeah unfortunately each expansion is sort of it's own contained story . but yeah I agree , the world is what keeps my interest
[4:43:28] Jaxerath: game of thrones bad
[4:43:28] ijuki: Just me or is twisting nether down on EU? monkaS

[4:43:58] Bernardo994: beacause your towel
[4:43:58] Besanth: I'm currently enjoying ESO cause they make the story so easy to play. Like each expansion is locked to a map so you can complete an entire map before moving to the next. @Kisswani
[4:43:59] jaysteea: he is a lil biatch
[4:44:02] doomkry: i mean how did khadhar even get to the shadowlands in the first place?

[4:47:37] mobbo: 2 handed mace is baller guilds just don’t care to gear the Warriors, Rets and DKs
[4:47:46] MILESkg21: if they didnt "fix" the stars on anduin, how many more kills would there be
[4:47:53] OldManMitch: nostalgia is a hell of a drug

[4:51:02] Otton_03: 14-15 echo players
[4:51:05] Naturalbeef: That gaming center Echo used in Germany looks incredible
[4:51:09] Gebirges: 4 in 4 rows ... so some were Scripe and other important staff, so about 10
[4:51:09] Jibbs280: how are u playing isnt wow down right now?
[4:51:11] rosstherosstrich: Liquids tank had to legit fly back to scotland @Towelliee
[4:51:15] Splashdownn: @Towelliee Method says that it's their last broadcast ending soonish today
[4:51:21] shagworth: Do you think raids should be designed to cater to RWF guild schedules? A lot of people seem to.
[4:51:23] MrKrahz: why is it easier to meet in EU than NA ?
[4:51:25] AlexIncorporated: Doesn't that make internet issues more prevalent?
[4:51:30] KingSlayerYotam: watching preach and gingi together was so fun
[4:51:33] raptorstrick: Cheaper flights too.  RyanAir
[4:51:34] BluffAlmighty: !WOW10
[4:51:34] Moobot: @BluffAlmighty World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion announcement date 4/19 and other exciting dates like WoW Mobile - Check it out! https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1500894944474501120?s=20&t=PgfuLeF2nRsESPGtuvNnbw

[4:51:39] Tokies: that makes sense
[4:51:42] mobbo: Liquid is in Mass
[4:51:44] Waldron27: they have quite a few EU players
[4:51:44] noway137: @rosstherosstrich he had to fly because of a family emergency as far as im aware tho
[4:51:51] Waldron27: internet issues cud play a factor
[4:51:56] Kisswani: I mean if the raid is gonna be 10 days or so , why abandon the on-site idea ?
[4:52:01] Heero_Effect: I think players should be on site. They do it for dota 2 tournaments so ya
[4:52:05] JoeyXXIX: internet issues aren't a concern with dedicated network..
[4:52:05] Lulaboo: Team liquid has player housing they couldnt use this race. So probably there will be in person raiding again, but maybe this time less people showing up
[4:52:07] Everbliss: @Towelliee what do you think about some sort of Roster system in WoW like LA?
[4:52:08] fowlentv: most races dont take this long as well lol
[4:52:08] SilkeySmooth: @Orirholim s you going to do sod with affixes for months?
[4:52:12] MILESkg21: true
[4:52:12] rosstherosstrich: @noway137 damn that sucks but I think they were done at that point
[4:52:14] buzescu: buzescu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[4:52:16] grapyz: must of been warm
[4:52:21] BullDevil: Liquid has the EU players though they want on scene to reduce lag. He said the lag for some during SoD race was a thing.
[4:52:22] Gebirges: You know what's funny? Every time Method/Echo played from Germany, they won.
[4:52:25] Cower311: imagine the smell and heat. nostaliga with the boys
[4:52:34] noway137: @rosstherosstrich well the point is that they werent expecting it to go on that long
[4:52:37] Orirholim: @SilkeySmooth no new content until expansion, so I suppose a lot of people will
[4:52:44] QMGSaint: It's the water.
[4:52:46] epsmd: Forcing degenerate gamers to interact with others for 3 weeks and put a public face is a NERF
[4:52:47] Gebirges: Must be the food
[4:52:47] ducksandgeese: Is battle net down?
[4:52:47] ExpressRat: its the snitzel buff
[4:52:49] Kisswani: @SilkeySmooth it's the drought between expansions , better to have that than nothing . and it's a test for the future
[4:52:52] Nevindaz: germany didnt won Kappa
[4:52:52] Melgor101: LUL
[4:52:54] noway137: @Towelliee and liquid won in London, is EU the secret?!?!

[4:53:04] SilkeySmooth: @Orirholim or unsub like most people are
[4:53:12] Lulaboo: Im getting my liquid plus points in that channel
[4:53:14] QMGSaint: It was Gingi's energy drinks!
[4:53:14] Shirey36: is there a reason echo didnt have these mental health issues liquid seem to have suffered from?
[4:53:17] noway137: Wait was Nzoth in London? or NA?
[4:53:20] papaherc: seems like this race wasnt as hype as previous races
[4:53:21] rosstherosstrich: Crazy how far Echo was from Pieces and method this tier.
[4:53:24] Cower311: GINGI JUICE
[4:53:35] akia03: its a pretty nice facility they were in
[4:53:37] theDirtyon3: @noway137 liquid won in Texas my man they lost in London
[4:53:41] xorxe7: just google it
[4:53:43] xFevers: @noway137 NA - Complexity center in TExas
[4:53:45] rosstherosstrich: @papaherc it was hype but hard to stay hyped for 18 days
[4:53:49] BullDevil: @Shirey36 who said they didn't? Naowh went home mid race for his mental health
[4:53:51] mavericks312: @silkeysmooth with m+ raiding I think more ppl will stay
[4:53:55] noway137: @theDirtyon3 Ah I mixed em up xD thanks
[4:54:13] kremdes: @Shirey36 I think echo had a more relaxed schedule. It seemed liquid had a lot of selfimposed stress
[4:54:25] KingSlayerYotam: hype dies out after a while sometimes events are just way too long.
[4:54:39] SilkeySmooth: @mavericks312 old wod dungeons with affixes will not keep people playing..lol
[4:54:42] Jibbs280: how are u logged in isnt wow down

[4:54:52] Niksen_99: Is Ret paladin good in Shadowlands ?
[4:55:00] fowlentv: Do you think all the split runs burnt most raiders out @Towelliee
[4:55:09] ExpressRat: how do you even tank as bear? just take damage?
[4:55:10] KragnosWoW: pereadin out here carrying all the keys KEKW
[4:55:11] BlackMarmalade: Easy

[4:55:48] BlackMarmalade: Unity on helm, cloak trash
[4:55:50] Maydie6066: Ursocs gets dropped when you get 2pc
[4:56:01] SilkeySmooth: @mavericks312 not from what im hearing you guys are living in crazy land..lol
[4:56:09] Cower311: unity on a teir slot is risky biz if you dont have teir yet
[4:56:16] AndinymusTV: i crafted unity on the belt till i have my 4p
[4:56:22] BlackMarmalade: Techinically belt is safer cause non tier, but helm gives best stats.
[4:56:24] Splashdownn: na dude get cosmix fluz at the end of m+s
[4:56:27] Vch001: So the mythic only phase was......a Shield?

[4:57:25] SupaAbe: Towel you on EU atm? bc i can't log into NA
[4:57:30] drewparry: @Towelliee are you on PTR?
[4:57:37] LizzardLIVE: whats that bag addon

[5:08:42] Thoreya: LUL LUL

[5:10:02] toopockets: What percentage of this chat do you think votes on political matters?
[5:10:07] CritcobainTV: Pereadin was up late last night doing keys from what i saw lol
[5:10:10] GamingInstinctsTV: Is this PTR? I can't login to the main game. @Towelliee as far as new expansion goes,  I just hope that some sort of a new class is a real deal. I want a new tank/heal/dps
[5:10:35] Gebirges: Dragon Isles? lmao no ... there are no floating Isles on Azeroth that are shaped like a dragon which have a portal to the Lifelands 🙃
[5:10:52] BlackMarmalade: God mode

[5:11:12] Heero_Effect: Icy veins haha
[5:11:23] BlackMarmalade: Yeah they added 2 dungeons so it went up fast
[5:11:28] Orirholim: @Gebirges apparently the islands are above lordaeron in one of the posts
[5:11:31] Armdel: well its higher with two new dungeons right
[5:11:31] ahrs1988: so sad the hunter tier sets are useless for pvp
[5:11:32] GamingInstinctsTV: @Gebirges just because its named Dragon Isles doesn't mean its shaped like a dragon. and Dragon Isles do exist in the WoW lore because Wrathion mentioned it in the BFA Leggo Questline
[5:11:33] TheUnknowing: wow, I wish i cared that much about m+ but im not pugging shit
[5:11:37] kokochris: ..unityyyyyy
[5:11:39] elanoira: can you change the stats on you craft legendary ?
[5:11:59] Gebirges: @GamingInstinctsTV i know that, but i want them to float
[5:12:01] K_Rok: i was able to log in
[5:12:07] Gebirges: @Orirholim what post?
[5:12:17] Shrenko: @elanoira yes
[5:12:24] Orirholim: mmo champion, pick one, there's a few that mention it
[5:12:25] lirly__: probs doesnt have rep yet
[5:12:25] BlackMarmalade: hes using belt cause he has tier helm
[5:12:25] StormiiG: SEVERS UP
[5:12:29] StormiiG: SERVERS UP
[5:12:31] Cower311: that implies hes gonna recraft unity when hes got better teir
[5:12:35] Cyraxe_: @elanoira Once you craft a legendary the stats are locked. If you want different stats you need to craft another one.
[5:12:44] Gebirges: @Orirholim you mean those speculation threads? lmao
[5:12:52] Effin_Steffin: Bewts
[5:12:52] elanoira: thx guys
[5:13:07] Thunderbrew: BC was down, back up now
[5:13:15] dysar5150: tried for almost 2hrs couldn't get into servers
[5:13:17] Orirholim: majority of them have the same idea, so a good majority of the stuff that is repeated in all the posts probably isn't that far off from the expansion
[5:13:32] Jarlan23: most woyers use bracers at least arms does
[5:13:44] BlackMarmalade: It's cloak and basically whatever you dont have tier in you stick unity
[5:13:47] elanoira: @Shrenko thx
[5:13:51] tophergtv: hey man how u enjoying 9.2?
[5:13:52] richardmu: @Towelliee bear 4-Set -  Architect's Aligner - While Berserked, you radiate (26.6% of Attack power) Cosmic damage to nearby enemies and heal yourself for (39.7% of Attack power) every 1 sec.
[5:13:52] SutureTV: you have to remember that people are making unity based on what gear they have received on prog. Most people in my guild have unity on 2-3 items rn
[5:13:56] CritcobainTV: I think it just depends what gear you currently have, you can just throw unity on whatever is the biggest upgrade that's nto a tier slot
[5:14:10] Darthyrevan: 36?! its 100k on my server
[5:14:14] Tornadogenesis: belt makes sense
[5:14:17] BlackMarmalade: belt def safest
[5:14:22] TheUnknowing: i did neck for unity cause yolo
[5:14:23] Colt_Engineer: @Darthyrevan and he on illidan too
[5:14:26] Reesessmack: your buyout is backwards. you paid 49k

[5:14:47] Teitanblood: You bought the most expensive one LUL
[5:14:52] CritcobainTV: Belt gets socket too LUL
[5:14:53] Darthyrevan: @Darthyrevan ah yeah true
[5:15:10] RalgorStreams: Just put your 2 leggos on whatever gives you the most stats unless you have a tier piece in that slot
[5:15:13] Thunderbrew: Can you buy a character boost in BC?
[5:15:21] Armdel: few boost runs and you made it all back and then soe
[5:15:22] CritcobainTV: Ring and neck have sockets, but gear has main stat
[5:15:23] Armdel: some
[5:15:27] Maydie6066: @Towelliee when you get 2pc, Ursocs starts falling behind Legacy
[5:15:35] Orirholim: Chest, Helmet, Legs give the most main stats. Ring, Neck give the most secondary stats.
[5:15:36] lirly__: cloak and bracers has low stats
[5:15:45] MerffTV: go ring until you get your optimal 4pc, then switch

[5:16:09] richardmu: the mat's for ring is very high
[5:16:10] mavericks312: cause ppl know they want non tier slots
[5:16:18] CritcobainTV: because people use ring a lot, and it's expensive to make
[5:16:20] DallTV_: cry its 161k on my server
[5:16:25] Colt_Engineer: they selling like hot cakes
[5:16:31] Skittlebeast: I can just see it now, all the Fury Warriors name changing to Willsmith

[5:18:12] BlueHusky17: lfr is mega easy. I was having a breezy, every boss dead from 1st try, no joke
[5:18:14] Orirholim: Maybe you'll luck into a LFR that is on Halondrus and you can skip the first 3 bosses.
[5:18:16] noway137: i think some top 100 guilds were considering LFR splits KEKW @Towelliee
[5:18:17] dracullus: is it even more fun than N'zoth LFR?
[5:18:26] Orirholim: Oh you're making one.
[5:18:27] CritcobainTV: 226
[5:18:31] maxlol: any updates on microsoft blizz acquisition?

[6:05:34] d0nclaws: does blood death knight ever press death's caress or just blood boil to apply the dots?
[6:05:46] Heero_Effect: Got a lost ark ad PartyHat
[6:05:53] akia03: someof the raiders got grounded by there mom for staying away to long
[6:06:21] Assmaster2k: true
[6:07:19] Kittastrophe: race to world first is a very taxing thing to go through - add travelling from home for a long time, it's probably not the healthiest for our boys
[6:07:26] bawheid: have Liquid got 11/11 yet?
[6:07:36] Emila777: What do you expect to happen in 21 days 23 hours?
[6:07:37] shagworth: Do you think Blizzard should design raid tiers to cater to RWF guilds schedules. it's just come to be expected that the race should not last more than 2 weeks so guilds can take time off and gather in one place.
[6:07:40] lenzoo21: i have no hope for NW anymore.. sadly
[6:07:47] N3llee: their dev studio head stepped down cause of the failure that New World turned out to be
[6:08:24] Kittastrophe: doing race for service first on stormrage was stressful enough for me.
[6:08:27] stratiss: no lol he left for family reasons
[6:08:31] Kittastrophe: server^
[6:08:35] OldManMitch: I thought new world was pretty sucessful;

[6:08:46] Y_U_CRYIN: No he left to spend time with family is the official version
[6:08:54] emznev: Echo had to Travel tho did not seem to effect them? or did liquid have too travel further ?
[6:08:56] lenzoo21: @OldManMitch first few weeks yeah
[6:09:06] Sherm0: man u just cant believe anything on the internet unless you know the person personally who says/types it
[6:09:14] Sherm0: everyone says something different
[6:09:16] FutileDiploma: I would say unluckily if he was invokeved in the publishing rights of lost ark

[6:09:26] noway137: The article alludes to it but he never came out and said it specifically @Towelliee
[6:09:51] lenzoo21: @emznev i dont think it matters that much. echo got raiders all over EU, liquid got raiders all over NA
[6:10:00] N3llee: i was going to link the Bloomberg article
[6:10:12] noway137: From the article: "One former Amazon Game Studios manager, who asked to remain anonymous because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly, said that Frazzini’s leadership of the unit suffered because he had not had prior experience in gaming"
[6:10:15] N3llee: as it makes a correlation to it and the timing of his departure.
[6:10:52] Rabidwalrus86: I quit Lost Ark a couple days ago after just after getting my 2nd alt to T3, I was doing a guardian raid on my berserker and after the 4th time the boss ran I just logged off and uninstalled.
