[1:05:49] Quickstepz: Nice 👍
[1:05:50] Martin19931: @luan93 i think 30kg naturally impossible. I made from 65-81 many years of working out. Based on body but still if you have 2m height 30 kg per year still iompossible with out steroids.
[1:05:55] Cowardpatty: In classic?  Hunters struggle hard against a rogue.  Dead zone.  Can't trap in combat.  No Disengage.

[1:28:42] aliko996: imagine 60 hardcore bg
[1:28:43] Tippolippo: after u ding 60 in hc u make a new 3x and ding 60 on that too. that's an achieve. to get 4x 60s without dying, with the other 60s at stake
[1:28:52] dazu189: are you enjoying you're hardcore experience @Swifty
[1:29:06] Holyryze: so mad i just lost my 15 warrior in barrens due to respawns....feels bad
[1:29:13] Tychoe: @aliko996 I would pay for it PokPikachu
[1:29:18] Tippolippo: LUL
[1:29:18] foghornlegnoodle: sup g
[1:29:20] aliko996: what about lvl 80 hardcore????
[1:29:54] Cosmic_KO: So is the official HC server going to be vanilla wow?
[1:29:55] portugues01: so... its literally nothing new content on this Hardcore mode? u playing WoW , except u cant die once..
[1:30:00] kcamptko: What else would you play??
[1:30:02] VanishmentThisWorld: i doubt they will make hardcore servers until sometime after diablo4 launches
[1:30:03] portugues01: sounds fun....
[1:30:06] portugues01: NOT !
[1:30:12] izyjakdvaspizy: !time
[1:30:21] Coastie6: What addon shows your rend/hamstring etc above your targets head swifty?
[1:30:35] izyjakdvaspizy: Whats mid max?
[1:30:39] aliko996: i want MOP classic server
[1:30:50] Cosmic_KO: I feel like there should be no AH but you should be able to trade or at least barter with other players within reason.
[1:31:01] Holyryze: its plater if he has it
[1:31:05] surrealixx: It's probably a weak aura @Swifty
[1:31:07] scoedawg: love you swifty. lookin real handsome today.
[1:31:19] TheEndIsNear777: i thought wrath pvp would be more balanced buts its always been the burst meta
[1:31:31] TheEndIsNear777: Burst meta = lame and outdated, only top 5% can react sniffle
[1:31:36] xichell: i died on my lvl 17 pally to a giant croc now im lvling a rogue :)
[1:31:41] Coastie6: Sweet thanks
[1:31:48] griter35: AH is fun
[1:32:00] VanishmentThisWorld: cus you could just get overpowered items
[1:32:02] Samandrace: cuz they're lame. just makes it a lot more annoying
[1:32:02] zupiter24: swiftySTARE I agree
[1:32:02] Purgency: this aint no solo self found hardcore Path of Exile league lmao
[1:32:04] Cowardpatty: To prevent having too much money, and getting twinked items
[1:32:07] xmedpakx: more challenging
[1:32:11] n8_2k: i hate no trading. So many greens i wanna be giving to other players
[1:32:14] aliko996: its kinda dumb who made these rules?
[1:32:15] Eat_Sleep_Rave_Repeat_91: NO FREE STUFF MY MAN
[1:32:17] tri0_0: only reason its not allowed as of now is because the entire server is not HC
[1:32:18] Eat_Sleep_Rave_Repeat_91: LUL
[1:32:20] surrealixx: if bots are gonna be inevitable, if you add the ability to trade goods between characters, pay to win will be a thing again
[1:32:26] legelia: Im currently doing whirlwind axe quest on my warrior, its a pain without AH haha
[1:32:30] payo_wet_fart_ppc: because u can have 60 lvl char and send items for your alt
[1:32:34] VanishmentThisWorld: but thats not hardcore thats normal classic
[1:32:36] humid1: being able to use the AH makes it too easy
[1:32:37] tri0_0: official HC servers, the AH will be available
[1:32:39] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:32:42] TheEndIsNear777: bots die in hc so there won't be many bots unless they write Gigabot 2000
[1:32:46] a_noob_is__: That doesn’t sound very hard core
[1:32:46] justplayisme: lol was the name swifty taken?
[1:32:59] Eat_Sleep_Rave_Repeat_91: still cheating LUL
[1:33:00] Intense3g: True
[1:33:03] Band3r3xIQ: that is why asmon gold doesn't play it he doesn't get free stuff from people
[1:33:03] Tompsa123: thats breaking the rules
[1:33:04] Berges: AH yes yes, to sell so many green stuff and skinnig stuff to make gold for mount
[1:33:05] zupiter24: I like fun
[1:33:08] Hyoox: cdew has died twice and still playing same warrior ncie hc :)
[1:33:09] surrealixx: You take the hardcore out of hardcore if you add the conveniences of regular classic
[1:33:09] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[1:33:14] Locrinus: But not everyone is a streamer and benefits from that fun
[1:33:14] rominio94: Normal classic with harder mobs, only elites
[1:33:15] aliko996: swifty u should work at blizzard for game development
[1:33:15] nishdj: @Swifty Sriracha or tobasco??
[1:33:19] justplayisme: swiffy is so good too lol
[1:33:20] Banoffee: having good gear would make the challenge way too easy though
[1:33:25] justplayisme: why not?
[1:33:26] Cosmic_KO: That's the point of HC though. To suffer and struggle. LUL
[1:33:29] sg_zee: I wanna bubble heartstone in HC
[1:33:30] kcamptko: ret is bad in classic uh
[1:33:43] surrealixx: You take the hardcore out of hardcore if you add the conveniences of regular classsic
[1:33:43] justplayisme: LOL
[1:33:47] Locrinus: Everyone is on the same level
[1:33:47] AxenPunker: yeah its not fun
[1:33:50] justplayisme: everyone gimp gg
[1:33:50] VanishmentThisWorld: gimpcore baby
[1:33:50] n8_2k: also no world grouping is kind of lame like who cares, takes away from how vanilla really felt back in the day
[1:33:52] Moorishak: you can...warriors with two handed weapon are pretty common under 30lvl
[1:34:01] TheEndIsNear777: hardcore is still hardcore, you die you die
[1:34:03] surrealixx: That's the point of hardcore though
[1:34:05] justjoshingyo: woah what happened to your stream set up swifty! moved rooms?

[1:34:19] MrPaulie: What I would do is, when you are leveling you can use auction, but only for professions. For example: If you are enchanter, you can't get rods for your enchanting, because you can't trade with a blacksmith.
[1:34:23] Moorishak: even on bosses, trust me, they not hit so much hard
[1:34:27] DeadBananaTV: Aint that the charm of hardcore? ^^
[1:34:49] surrealixx: Adding the ability to trade will allow bots to sell items and gold again, thus making hardcore pay to win
[1:35:00] scorpibrot: what is the ruls for hardcore ?
[1:35:10] cactus__jak: how can bots survive in hardcore
[1:35:12] Aimessan: CoolCat
[1:35:17] TheEndIsNear777: Bots won't be in HC unless there will be Gigaboot 2000 Program
[1:35:26] VanishmentThisWorld: funny thing is if that stuff was allowed most peeps would complain that its too easy
[1:35:44] Galdrena: Rule for Hardcore: https://classichc.net/rules/
[1:35:52] Qman157: are there HC servers coming?
[1:35:59] Tippolippo: I'd level to 60 manually then farm by bot ;)
[1:36:09] griter35: even pro wow players die
[1:36:10] solsaver12: they dyin to silly things tho
[1:36:20] epicpockettroll: u can set to realm while
[1:36:23] therealsweggieboi: Wonder if we'll be able to transfer our hc characters to the supposed official one
[1:36:34] Band3r3xIQ: in EU yesterday aswel alot of death pop ups :o it was insane
[1:36:35] hydraponix: your thing says fail? were you griefed?
[1:36:45] turbospooling: its in interface addons
[1:36:56] Hyoox: @therealsweggieboi wut ? its brand new thing
[1:37:09] cybernaticspark: What is best proffesion for hc warriors ?
[1:37:10] Hyoox: this isnt hc @therealsweggieboi
[1:37:17] FoolsForest: I made it to 60 in HC and I gotta say the old Iron Man challenge in Cata was way harder by comparison
[1:37:25] cactus__jak: i really wanna try warrior once the official servers launch, rogue is pretty easy in comparison i think
[1:37:30] solsaver12: Its not too hard lol
[1:37:39] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:37:42] xmedpakx: so far its been pretty easy
[1:37:49] legelia: @Swifty why is your map so weird? Looks zoomed in around it
[1:37:49] surrealixx: I dont think it's hard, I think people underestimate the game and overestimate their own ability in the open world
[1:37:53] grosserDaumen: why not hunter?
[1:37:56] blastnovaarea52: Rogue or Mage
[1:38:00] mob_figgaz213: hardcore servers should have mobs always neutral never aggro
[1:38:09] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:38:16] hydraponix: swifty your addon says you died were you griefed?
[1:38:19] Tippolippo: druid is very good, but only after 20
[1:38:23] justplayisme: aggro mobs are harsh
[1:38:25] Tippolippo: took so long to level to 20
[1:38:27] DeadBananaTV: I think there are other achievements too, like lvling without gear and so on, that sounds hard XD
[1:38:35] olathoris: how do you level so quickly
[1:38:35] thickem: y u rending
[1:38:37] souplucky: has there been any news/confiramtion on the official hc servers?
[1:38:38] Cowardpatty: Druids are Tier 1 levelers
[1:38:53] Moorishak: But druid got struggle with mana...few shapeshifts and you are dry
[1:38:56] einsmaldrei: PAPA FTW
[1:38:56] xmedpakx: hardcore servers should have dialog with all mobs to talk them out of their gear, no need to die
[1:39:02] xmedpakx: ><
[1:39:04] einsmaldrei: PALA FTW
[1:39:16] a_noob_is__: Druids can’t vanish
[1:39:18] rominio94: Carrying healing gear sounds harsh
[1:39:21] Band3r3xIQ: i think rogue and warlock are the best for level
[1:39:26] Band3r3xIQ: and safety
[1:39:27] cliffytheboi: HOWDY
[1:39:29] Hyoox: according this chat ppl never played games which has actual hardcore
[1:39:54] surrealixx: With people not being used to only having one life and risking their characters without the conveniences that classic usually brings, people take too many risks and die early @Swifty
[1:40:08] ty_ston96: druids can vanish by useing shadowmeld as a Nightelf but if tauren your kinda out of luck
[1:40:14] justplayisme: ya should be able to group up for sure
[1:40:20] kurupone: and it doesnt matter that druid cant rezz in hc KEKW
[1:40:24] solsaver12: I agree with that
[1:40:28] n8_2k: EXACTLY, it takes away from how vanilla felt back in the day
[1:40:30] MuchasTV: you cant shadowmeld in combat @ty_ston96
[1:40:30] tri0_0: negative
[1:40:32] justplayisme: should be able to play with anyone you see in the world
[1:40:33] Cosmic_KO: Yeah, I don't get why you can't at least group outside dungeons. Kind of lame.
[1:40:35] MuchasTV: druids dont have a vanish
[1:40:35] rominio94: Shadowmeld don't work in combat in classic
[1:40:38] grosserDaumen: shadowmeld dont work like that in classic^^'
[1:40:38] Moorishak: ty_ston96 you cant use shadowmeld in combat man...
[1:40:43] a_noob_is__: I would say prot pally or rogue and possibly ele sham
[1:40:45] MrPaulie: Shadowmeld doesn't work in combat in classic.
[1:40:48] VanishmentThisWorld: Grouping might be ok but only within 5 lvls of each other to prevent boosting
[1:40:49] zerqo93: I would love if they allowed people to group up for those quests where you need loot from 1 specific mob
[1:40:50] tsunderete: Buenas noches desde España, se te quiere!
[1:41:05] tri0_0: its hardcore, not softcore
[1:41:12] kcm92: what would you say are the top 3 most fun classes to play in hc classic
[1:41:14] Herzenliegen: It's not suppose to be easy. It's Hc
[1:41:16] Blaver1: I’m sure you’ve been asked or explained it, but what happened to your other room with the dragon heads?
[1:41:23] MuchasTV: hardcore andy
[1:41:28] Berges: Swifty this a Chanllege, tor each level 60 with limited resources, so i believe if Blizzard realese a server harcore its gonna dediferent
[1:41:31] zerqo93: It's not like they are hard to kill or anything, it would just be so when the mob dies at least 5 people goes away
[1:41:37] rominio94: Real hardcore would be only you playing on the server
[1:42:05] n8_2k: hate it when i ask a random dude to help with a pack of mobs and hes takin it too seriously and says "thats against the rules"
[1:42:33] ellzzyy01: Good evening

[1:42:54] okEllen: that's exciting PogChamp
[1:43:00] Teagens: Gonna be great to see that Arcade
[1:43:50] n8_2k: @Herzenliegen i know im jus sayin that rule should be lifted cause it takes away from how vanilla is supposed to feel. Its an MMO, not supposed to be played solo the entire time hahha
[1:44:24] Beyondvapor: publix is pretty nice but they have a stick stuck up their hoo haw
[1:44:45] mob_figgaz213: because capitalism
[1:44:46] topalphadog1: you enjoying hc swifty
[1:45:10] Chainzzy1: Gaming house 4.0 KomodoHype
[1:45:14] Herzenliegen: @Layzo2k It's a HC server. If you want to grp up there's other servers that are not HC.
[1:45:29] Smufalu: kids usually hang around.. mess with carts and damage property unfortunately and they want to keep things welcoming to old clients
[1:45:35] andrewsftw0: Whats your feelings towards retaill atm? iv been unsubbed for about 4 months now and still got no intrest coming back xD
[1:45:43] aguntus: what will you call the Arcade Place, Swifty's place ?
[1:45:45] Roundonedog: Why leatherworking?
[1:45:51] zerqo93: @Swifty Don't you have the addon called what's training?
[1:46:00] Swantee: I really miss the gaming houses <3
[1:46:13] andrewsftw0: Mythic plus >.> feel obliged to do it
[1:46:16] MrTortellone: i quite retail i have enough
[1:46:16] jurassicf: jurassicf subscribed with Prime.

[1:46:30] peroladan: for me it was the "swoosh" sound effects on all classes and all spells..retails ruined the immersion
[1:46:32] Galaedan: !followage
[1:46:32] StreamElements: @Galaedan, galaedan has been following swifty for  8 years 8 months 16 days 14 hours
[1:46:35] Herzenliegen: @Layzo2k That's why it will be interesting to see how blizzard goes forward with a new HC server
[1:46:47] n8_2k: @Herzenliegen true, but i do like how everyone plays knowing we have 1 life, adds a cool challenge without taking away from the vanilla feeling
[1:47:11] n8_2k: @Herzenliegen tryin to jus get a couple homies so i can try duo or trio
[1:47:24] wagyu_88: People cant just play the game and use skill. gata use an addon and be like ohhhhhhh im sooo goood

[1:49:24] andrewsftw0: It was a mythic plus that did it for me the system is awful and extremely toxic and felt obliged to do it as raid teams wanted certain ratings etc
[1:49:48] Lowtsie: theres a pygmy spider
[1:50:10] xmedpakx: cheating?
[1:50:18] PsykoQT: man alot of lies
[1:50:30] Galaedan: VIP after my 10th year?? Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:50:30] babusch09: it IS
[1:50:35] PsykoQT: where do you got proof?
[1:50:39] Cowardpatty: Not sure it's cheating, but it's against the 'spirit of the game'.
[1:50:41] xmedpakx: sounds fixed and cheating
[1:50:42] epicpockettroll: yeeeee, thats why i think adding a rating to solo shuffle was a mistake
[1:50:57] zerqo93: @Swifty if you don't use what's training? I would recommend it as it shows what you will learn in the future levels without having to go to a trainer :)
[1:51:42] haralanovfc: !server
[1:51:43] StreamElements: Swifty is on  Bloodsail Buccaneers (RP) for hardcore on Classic servers. For Retail and others type !realm.
[1:51:46] SunnyBlades: why u take doublearm sword?
[1:52:23] zerqo93: @Swifty So the addon called What's training, it will show what your class can learn each 2 levels. So if you are far in the open world and see like level 26 doesn't give you anything good you can just keep on leveling without going to your class trainer

[1:53:01] zerqo93: yeah
[1:53:03] olathoris: how do you level so quickly 󠀀
[1:53:04] MrTortellone: quest Dialogs are all with sound ?
[1:53:09] kegan_shotz: swiftyCRISP
[1:53:09] zerqo93: it's so worth it, saves a lot of time.
[1:53:10] epicpockettroll: think the solo shuffle design should just replace the old arena skirmish, u learn more from 6 games in a row, then just 1 game where u might get oneshot in first 10 sec
[1:53:32] Scumbagstief: HeyGuys
[1:53:54] cheechums_: what happened to the dungeon? I miss the dragon heads lol
[1:54:03] Galdrena: !room

[2:19:02] BoricuaSJ: @Benno_B86 I would say retail is better for casual.  much easier to level up, and get to end game playing. Classic, you actually have to dedicate time and effort, and as a casual, it will take forever.
[2:19:05] Galdrena: no official servers but there might be @tellmeagainiforgot
[2:19:45] SauceeyK: Honestly though. Classic is way more fun than retail in my opinion

[2:21:31] Holytankman: hey swifty how are you.
[2:21:34] Brittfire: I'd imagine that if everyone was 1 life only, then trading could be allowed. The rule is mainly to stop being fed by 60's farming.
[2:21:56] thunderioum: blizz should release the a new version of wow classic with all cut content included ! watch the internet explode
[2:22:17] BoricuaSJ: I played both, and it was cool to re-call classic, but I did miss not having my old classic guildmates from the days I played. they all grown up, kids, etc...
[2:22:22] spagoo__: I love ya Swifty but because your Alliance we can never be friends.

[2:34:27] Cyxxplz: @CriticalDroog That quest requires you to kill a lvl 35 elite. GL at lvl 25 :P
[2:34:30] Adellwind: Chest by the outhouse
[2:34:32] EffecLeet: have you lvled in darkshore at all?
[2:34:38] Holytankman: there is a chest behind you

[2:35:08] Panos_Smok: Is the Retri Paladin stronger in PvP than Warrior ?
[2:35:31] that408guy: How many hours do you have into this character?
[2:35:49] Panos_Smok: in Classic  i mean !
[2:35:50] steinarfj80: equipped boots are better?
[2:36:01] Cyxxplz: @CriticalDroog True, the first quest in the chain requires lvl 28 tho, just checked :)
[2:36:11] officerdoody: ret is still busted in retail
[2:36:25] EffecLeet: have you lvled in darkshore on your warr? or do you know how to get there safely as human ? :D
[2:36:44] Cosmic_KO: @TojaraWoW If you mean vanilla classic, ret pally is terrible. Warrior is way better.
[2:36:47] epicpockettroll: i wouldnt mind it, but the fact that its a very easy spec irritates me more
[2:37:03] bazzzgg: I quit retail, i came across Hardcore because i forgot to cancel my sub for the month
[2:37:09] solsaver12: human must walk thru wetlands to get to boat to darkshore
[2:37:12] cheechums_: had some ret pally talking ish about how good he was hitting 100 parse.. like homie you are a ret pally. lol
[2:37:24] a_noob_is__: And they can through a fat heal
[2:37:32] natckok: hey swifty love u

[2:38:10] BigUnknownGamer: yes
[2:38:11] Frank4LuLz: 1ST
[2:38:14] Panos_Smok: @Cosmic_KO am thinking to start playing classic again and i am beetween the Retri Pala and Warrior
[2:38:17] ForsakenTV3: Just give a debuff that doesn't allow wings while bubbled and I think a lot of headaches go away with Rets
[2:38:31] Frank4LuLz: WOKE SILLYNESS
[2:38:40] Cosmic_KO: @joe_broo Nooooooooo, he meant retail wow. HC wow will be using vanilla ret pally which was terrible. It's basically a warrior but instead of a regular weapon it uses a pool noodle..
[2:38:51] saleanorttv: On which server you play?
[2:38:51] 77ando: 1
[2:39:05] Cosmic_KO: @TojaraWoW Only good pally class in HC will be holy. Go warrior if you wanna dps.
[2:39:07] ughsmash: and multiple classes can now get rid of bubble it isnt as op as it usd to be
[2:39:14] Joe_Broo: @joe_broo damn gotcha
[2:39:17] skillxraw: bubble hs will be allowed in classic+?
[2:39:26] epicpockettroll: dont most go double horsey aswell
[2:39:36] a_noob_is__: 😂😂
[2:39:43] justjoshingyo: why dont they have shared mobs in classic =\
[2:39:50] Frank4LuLz: utility toon
[2:39:53] MuchasTV: you sound crisp
[2:39:53] ForsakenTV3: 20 yrds min, it's crazy with the range they have
[2:39:53] Joe_Broo: Whats a good HC starter class?
[2:40:00] ughsmash: except on aoe bosses you can use Ravager on Ret and top DPS
[2:40:08] bazzzgg: Ret and Boomkin meme specs in classic :D
[2:40:32] Frank4LuLz: melee damage is the mace or sword rogue
[2:40:34] daltonlowe74: do u think MOP was a good xpac
[2:40:38] Cosmic_KO: Nah, I'd still say ravager with a warrior will be better than ret still.
[2:41:01] MrKribz: MrKribz subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:41:02] StreamElements: MrKribz just subscribed PogChamp
[2:41:05] israelelelel: Teagen didnt die, right?
[2:41:14] ughsmash: Ravager is way better on Ret and Shaman than warrior because it procs your seals/weapon enchants so you are wrong.
[2:41:25] Panos_Smok: But i have seen some videos of Retri Palas in Classic that are Very Strong and win everytime 1v1
[2:41:29] MrKribz: SeemsGood
[2:41:37] Teagens: :p I am alive.

[2:42:16] FlameStryke: Imagine dying... "Calamity Sound" In a 20+ year old game
[2:42:21] Cosmic_KO: @joe_broo Hunter and Warlock are good since you have pets, rogue has good damage and a lot of outs to escape combat. Warrior is great damage, but lacks self heals so go with herb/alchemy if you go that route.
[2:42:25] MuchasTV: Shadowfang keep probably

[2:44:06] adsgg3: herb alch is extremely easy to level as u go tbh
[2:44:32] irishguyliam: Do you think you'll be playing on the official HC servers when they release?
[2:44:45] LiniutaRo: @adsgg3 never had to farm,i even sell extra flowers
[2:44:54] Cosmic_KO: It's much more practical though since with a warrior you have to have potions and bandages to stay alive.
[2:44:56] a_noob_is__: swiftyHappy swiftyHappy swiftyHappy
[2:45:06] Teagens: CANT HEAR YOU ON DISCORD
[2:45:15] Jnxakabeasie: Ive watched swifty since i was 13 im 30 now HA

[2:56:57] Connicus: he has life tap on Q and dark rune on shiftQ
[2:57:11] solsaver12: I wouldnt do it either....no dungeons or raids on hc
[2:57:18] klercketv: @Swifty it was a 31 dmg overkill from the rune
[2:57:23] FlameStryke: ya the HC elite guild has been so long doing BWL and MC and Ony, ZG, and AQ 20 and had no deaths, then in one relaxed AQ 20 they lost 3 to a mob

[3:05:13] Cybernytez: ret in classic feels awful ^^ in Wrath it advances to god tier and omega fun LUL
[3:05:19] FlameStryke: with the layering @Swifty
[3:05:23] FlameStryke: its much easier
[3:05:28] Pallyofhell: no ret in wrath is awful until you get to 70
[3:05:33] Frikinmatt: sounds like SAO
[3:05:35] Frank4LuLz: crazy race

[3:06:33] Pallyofhell: yea no its not fun
[3:06:40] SilkeySmooth: avoid the line quests
[3:06:44] solsaver12: grind mobs and hope gear drops
[3:06:54] FlameStryke: I don't do line up simulator i skip those
[3:06:55] Cybernytez: well that ur opinion i have mine ^^
[3:06:56] hugs91: Nah questing is good just grind past the bottlenecks
[3:07:05] FoolsForest: That's why I switched to Wotlk HC. It's so much more relaxed and still challenging.

[3:08:25] topalphadog1: ya i see that all the time and im 37
[3:08:43] xmedpakx: imo , blizz needs to make questmods tagable to all, no rezzes ever, no pvp ever, and group for elite type quests only
[3:08:47] FlameStryke: 100% agree with @teagun
[3:08:57] eoi_attritshun: Whaddap Swifty! Hope you are having a great day man
[3:09:32] FlameStryke: HC is about the Honor system that you would follow the rules without being policed. I thinkbliz won't do anything but the mininum
[3:09:32] anexcahh: hey bro how old are you
[3:09:41] Alearic06: official hardcore will kill hardcore
[3:09:48] xmedpakx: i like the no trade no AH
[3:09:56] StickySativa: blizz barelt gonna do anything ever
[3:09:59] SilkeySmooth: players will still use the hardcore addon
[3:10:03] Pallyofhell: so its just ironman
[3:10:13] lildawgy: why would that be hard :P
[3:10:16] Frank4LuLz: not that hard

[3:11:06] Pallyofhell: @anexcahh hey dude he's 29
[3:11:09] Grael1256: I think concentrating on anti griefing fixes in - such as leashing and stuff would be a priority over stuff like trade and AH
[3:11:10] alantin77: they will just adjust the hardcore addon
[3:11:20] topalphadog1: ya dont see nothing wrong with trading
[3:11:25] AnthonySo1337: LUL
[3:11:29] anexcahh: @Pallyofhell no hes atleast 45
[3:11:32] freddy_fazbearrr: yes boddy needs a new boat

[3:11:43] Erik24: having a rez isnt HC thou
[3:11:44] obliteratoe: it shouldnt ne too difficult to add a few lines of code to make the changes needed for hardcore
[3:11:45] Frank4LuLz: 3 pac-man heads
[3:11:45] Beyondvapor: its really not a a big deal like shes saying theyve been doing hardcore diablo for 20= years
[3:11:46] Brittfire: Stop it Swifty.
[3:11:52] Brittfire: they may be lsitening.
[3:11:55] sttaw: it would cost $1 per level
[3:11:57] Kaysidious: what if they added a flying mount
[3:11:59] Cybernytez: well that would be kill the whole purpose even 1 ress ^^
[3:11:59] Milford1337: @anexcahh swifty is 29, he just has great skin

[3:12:44] Brittfire: Blizzard accountants rubbing their hands together already. They can already see the money.
[3:12:45] 1MikeJ: That would totally go against the concept of hardcore
[3:12:46] anexcahh: uyou
[3:12:50] bepsisthebeast: they doing faction changing deals 6 for 70$
[3:12:51] FlameStryke: Just make it so you cann res your toon at level 1 and can't EQ your gear until you hit the appropriate level again
[3:12:54] AxenPunker: Swifty is biggest troll xD

[3:13:26] KoroyMoroy: Buy a coffin
[3:13:27] Brittfire: Hardcore titles
[3:13:29] FlameStryke: i think it should be 10 levels if they die
[3:13:29] abbarosh: new place mate?
[3:13:30] Jnxius: Sell player housing and you can buy decoration slots
[3:13:32] FlameStryke: not 1

[3:13:35] caletto: DansGame
[3:13:35] Cybernytez: lol that would be great actually if it was for retail as well LUL
[3:13:36] skillxraw: make cash go to tournament
[3:13:38] bepsisthebeast: i was thinkin that
[3:13:40] FlameStryke: that's not punnishment for 1 level
[3:13:40] QuietBang: And it carries over to normal server
[3:13:42] Frank4LuLz: guardian pets
[3:13:43] AnniMattR: sell  gear that levels with you
[3:13:46] Brittfire: Pay to make your ghost visible.
[3:13:49] birthrate_saver: you get a y-shirt
[3:13:56] AnthonySo1337: rip lvl 38 hunter
[3:13:59] FlameStryke: GO TO RETAIL for that
[3:14:02] FlameStryke: LOL
[3:14:07] FlameStryke: that would not go well with HC
[3:14:11] Frank4LuLz: loomz
[3:14:13] anexcahh: hey swifty are u 45 or 49
[3:14:17] Cybernytez: if the mogs carry over to retail i would actually do the achievements
[3:14:19] wikileakswow: so is this pvp real?
[3:14:20] xichell: if you die on your geared character you need to lvl another character to max lvl and sacfrice it for your geared dead character could be able to resurrect i think that would be cool
[3:14:22] Pallyofhell: hardcore isnt even hardcore
[3:14:22] KoroyMoroy: buy lvl boosting stuff
[3:14:25] AbyzzFails: only allow one characer slot u have to purchase more slots
[3:14:33] FlameStryke: ya the mods who spoke to blizzard a while back would never go for that
[3:14:37] VanishmentThisWorld: HardCore Launch Edition 100$
[3:14:37] Brittfire: People would pay to have their ghosts of their HC chars be visible to live players.
[3:14:52] FlameStryke: someone in the raid only
[3:14:53] anexcahh: HEY SWIFTY U LOOK LIKE GRANDPA
[3:14:55] shadow2step: How long before the boosting guilds show up lol
[3:14:57] Frank4LuLz: rust
[3:14:58] FlameStryke: @swifty we spoke about that
[3:15:02] Bigd3an1: u sld be able to loot like 30$ of the total gold
[3:15:03] lildawgy: hardcore pvp with corpse loot xd
[3:15:04] FlameStryke: quite a bit in the HC discord
[3:15:04] Jnxius: selling revives is probably best.  Make it an option upon death.  $$ Rez or re-roll
[3:15:07] wikileakswow: Is this PvP?
[3:15:08] Bigd3an1: 30%
[3:15:14] aviduser2: omg that would be cool on actual hardcore servers
[3:15:15] israelelelel: all theses ideas are terrible btw lol
[3:15:16] aviduser2: where you drop loot
[3:15:17] birthrate_saver: high risk high reward
[3:15:23] wagyu_88: You guys are so dramatic. Hardcore is going from 1-60 without dying. Just chill lol
[3:15:25] Rello113: maybe just let them loot 1 of their items at random
[3:15:27] Pallyofhell: they can do that but they have to restrict the lvl gap to 3 to 5 lvls so high lvls cant grief low lvls
[3:15:30] FlameStryke: if you die in a raid at 60 and your gear becomes lootable and then someone in your raid could be assigned to pick it up
[3:15:33] bepsisthebeast: make griefing banable
[3:15:35] AbyzzFails: 10$ for each character that dies lul
[3:15:39] FlameStryke: so if a pally died, another pally could loot it
[3:15:40] Frank4LuLz: quest mob
[3:15:49] aviduser2: @wagyu_88 no, it continues at 60
[3:15:56] anexcahh: HEY SWIFTY ARE U 39 YEARS OLD OR 45
[3:15:58] Frank4LuLz: different quest
[3:16:06] FlameStryke: they won't ban griefing because officially its "a smart use of mechanics" its pvp
[3:16:07] shadow2step: they are griefing you lol
[3:16:08] diegok: porque esta la tienes que hacer en el cementerio de la iziquierda swifty
[3:16:10] Pallyofhell: @anexcahh we told you he's 29
[3:16:11] topalphadog1: the ghoul by the graves are aaround that level
[3:16:17] Kyndyr: they are lower at the other side of the zone
[3:16:20] FYNEw0w: do it at the cemetary
[3:16:22] aviduser2: thats weird numbers
[3:16:23] solsaver12: Swifty looks great at 53
[3:16:24] SilkeySmooth: players should be able to continue to play if they die and join a non HC guild to raid if they want
[3:16:27] Sushi_Seijin: :O
[3:16:28] alantin77: there are a lot of casters that hit like trucks in that zone
[3:16:28] Beyondvapor: skateboarding
[3:16:28] Cybernytez: lel
[3:16:30] AbyzzFails: what is this exercise u speak of
[3:16:31] aviduser2: swifty are you 65 or 23
[3:16:34] chatisonfire: extra fries
[3:16:36] FlameStryke: what mixer are you using swifty
[3:16:36] Brittfire: Excercise. to hard. anything else?
[3:16:42] shadow2step: anything besides exercise?lol
[3:16:43] FlameStryke: is it a go XLR?
[3:16:43] Hiox___: @Swifty Its just because they drop the item you need, the ones you want are on the other side of the map, lower level mobs
[3:16:44] ugaboogalu: hey swifty when you gonna stream New World
[3:16:59] Jnxakabeasie: no 24 is max
[3:16:59] a_noob_is__: Drink water
[3:17:00] wagyu_88: @aviduser2  i think it should end at 60. you reach it now you can have ***
[3:17:04] Beyondvapor: @Brittfire my 106 year old grandmother says oreos

[7:16:48] fosomes: Everyone's bored with retail and wotlk
[7:16:55] captainpronin: that way you enjoy the leveling with friends
[7:16:55] papichurrosx: @captainpronin  But is it confirmed to be getting its own version of the game/realm?
