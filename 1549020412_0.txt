[1:17:37] SeckSymbols: @PlebXL Its always been based off of the dungeons done the previous week, its never upgraded post patch
[1:17:45] Docta_G: pretty sure chest tomorrow will still be 278, that hasn't changed
[1:17:48] Eikus11: @PlebXL it will still be S3 loot tomorrow
[1:18:01] gundius: @Towelliee Do u think they will release in the release window
[1:18:23] SeckSymbols: DF could easily release within 2022, Late november/Early december is very attainable
[1:18:42] ElDrakenMan: Copium^
[1:18:54] theoriginalzinng: invis pot?
[1:19:15] Jagz2k: !ALPHA
[1:19:16] Moobot: @Jagz2k ALPHA PHASE 4 TOMORROW - Dracthyr Starting Zone/Thaldraszus (68-70) Gotta be Warrior week right? | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[1:19:19] SeckSymbols: @drakenPWN Im basing that purely off the fact that the zones released so far seem complete and in a better state than we got them in SL alpha at this same time
[1:19:27] theoriginalzinng: looked like you ddid
[1:19:36] matching_towels: Engi belt
[1:19:45] ElDrakenMan: I know im just memeing, I think it will meet target
[1:19:46] blade_killa: so im from the land down under is it really tomorrow coming out ?
[1:19:47] PhantomPrime_: !alpha

[1:19:56] zed_1992: yes
[1:20:33] dwolters_the_zombieman: I'm not happy that Blizzard is nerfing soar from 910% to basically what are flying is now
[1:21:05] fluh_: Why would they do that
[1:21:09] Molvonos: @dwolters_the_zombieman Its still faster than normal epic flight though.
[1:21:53] theoriginalzinng: surv hunter thumb
[1:21:54] dwolters_the_zombieman: they gave dumbest reason why
[1:22:10] llNoTToXiCll: @Towelliee  you ever think about maining a surv hunter you were really goodat it lol
[1:22:18] dwolters_the_zombieman: soar will be like epic flying
[1:22:32] fluh_: What's the point in showing 910% if you're gonna nerf it smdh blizz
[1:22:35] ElDrakenMan: @Towelliee did you see a masseuse?
[1:22:46] theoriginalzinng: yeah its still way faster
[1:22:47] onslaughtak: lmao
[1:22:55] luke238: kek
[1:22:57] llNoTToXiCll: MuSt bE FasTeR
[1:23:04] SeckSymbols: @fluh_ Weird, its almost like it wasn't publicly tested
[1:23:27] oreo_mintx: @dwolters_the_zombieman it is not that bad
[1:23:37] tronbadgames: i feel like a new class, in alpha - there's gonna be tuning.. calling it a nerf and having a bunch of players who dont have alpha access freak out, seems really weird and premature
[1:23:38] fluh_: Still dumb to show 910 then wanna nerf it
[1:23:49] zysmos: that's technically not a big deal but that's straight up a bad change
[1:23:54] The_Dane_Train: Why not make the recharge time longer outside the dragon isles. That way people can still do fun things.
[1:23:58] SeckSymbols: @fluh_ So is it dumb to have trinkets in the game do one thing and then nerf it? Its the same argument

[1:24:42] dwolters_the_zombieman: they should give a better reason but they gave dumbest reasons
[1:24:43] fluh_: It literally aethestic basically. It didn't need nerfed is what I me saying lmao it aint bettering your toon or some shit
[1:24:48] NieIas: this week they will revert it and say "look were listening again!" and twitter mob will praise them again
[1:24:52] Armdel: was something like "they get an unfair advantage when it comes to farming mounts and mogs"
[1:25:11] pupkat: @Towelliee you missed the point... it is to avoid farming being too easy
[1:25:21] zysmos: hope they consider backing out on this that's bullshit imo
[1:25:26] Goldberryz: same stupid stuff as when they nerfed speed sets from legion
[1:25:26] Skars111: theres sharding and phasing in the game witch basically make world bosses 100% up at all times @Towelliee  haha
[1:25:34] theoriginalzinng: who cares, let people who farm play something other than druid for once

[1:26:16] Machine42593: shjouldve hammered the big guy and used ur orb
[1:26:16] dwolters_the_zombieman: the speed of soar doesn't dictate on rather you get a mount or not
[1:26:28] IVJamieIV: All that Phat Copper ore
[1:26:32] pupkat: @Towelliee pet bags
[1:26:39] ElDrakenMan: @Towelliee did you see asmons video on the slime cat mount? He brought up some good points about trash adds in raids disrespecting the players time. would appreciate your thoughts
[1:26:44] Skars111: Trivial content? lol still doesnt make sense
[1:26:51] theoriginalzinng: yeah its not like you are picking up that herb thats on a ledge while you are going 910% anyhow lol
[1:27:07] Rabiahtaro132: The only thing I can think the nerf is for, is future proofing future expansion, if you are able to soar there without flying.
[1:27:19] Truthseeker96: @Towelliee whats your time played?
[1:27:38] Naturalbeef: Naturalbeef subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! Love ya Bro
[1:27:41] Eutopia: If their excuse was sound then Demon Hunters shouldn't exist
[1:27:45] WestonTeli: i think soar kinda implies flying at launch for future expansions, it's strong
[1:27:54] theoriginalzinng: all the time
[1:28:26] Awesm_mossm: @towelliee just got back into WoW do my u know if they are supposed to be getting rid of the 50% xp buff when new season starts?
[1:28:28] Eutopia: I just mean as far as farming dungeons etc faster
[1:28:31] mizuwaer: @CloudierCloud that is the only valid point ive heard about soar
[1:28:34] PvtHudson093: DH just falling with style
[1:28:46] Eikus11: @Awesm_mossm yes
[1:28:46] mashiesmashie: everyone can make a Dracthyr who has the expansion so I don't see a problem
[1:28:54] Eutopia: Really? lol its in the blue post
[1:29:09] Awesm_mossm: @eikus11 damn so much for getting alt leveled...started up too late lol
[1:29:32] SeckSymbols: They dont even mention dungeons in the bluepost
[1:29:39] Eutopia: I guess they actually don't play the game then
[1:29:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: make dragon riding world wide for all classes, bring soar down to no cooldown so they are their own mount
[1:29:57] Eutopia: @SeckSymbols they mention transmog farming
[1:30:04] kjdocs: so if there is some weird corner case, then just nerf that instead, such as unintended dungeon use.
[1:30:15] dwolters_the_zombieman: I don't do pet battles so what does soar have to do with people not doing pet battles, I don't see a lot of people do pet battles
[1:30:15] kjdocs: which seems like you can't do anyway.
[1:30:21] SeckSymbols: @Eutopia But that isnt in dungeon though, they are still mentioning it as an overworld travel ability
[1:31:10] Eutopia: @SeckSymbols  it just goes to show the dev who wrote that doesn't play the game
[1:31:16] Kayote7: Very true
[1:31:27] Kayote7: Ppl complain already up front
[1:31:30] NEMERL: Dragonriding was better in prevous build now they mess it up @Towelliee
[1:31:33] Kayote7: For what :p
[1:31:41] WestonTeli: like how everyone is crying about dps balancing right now lmao
[1:32:18] dwolters_the_zombieman: they should at least gave us good reasons not shitty reasons that's what I'm more mad about
[1:32:22] Scraggersmeh: They made the dragons have actual weight. before they turned on a dime, now it's like an airplane.
[1:32:32] cabalish: !advanced
[1:32:34] Skars111: its a very hot topic on the wow forums atm, and quite a few people have made youtube video's about it including Asmongold,
[1:32:36] elrawin: I mean this is WoW, since 2004 the player base has always had one thing to complain about. If it wasn’t this, it’d be something else. And as long as it’s constructive feedback it’s fine and good for the game
[1:32:55] cabalish: ok
[1:32:57] Maytan26: !ALPHA

[1:33:02] R2RHIN0: what key level should we shoot for this week? like a 17-18?
[1:33:08] George2001k: Still no Warlock specs…. Wtf
[1:33:14] SeckSymbols: I wonder if the weightiness of the dragons is because this previous weeks build is based off of you having barely got your dragon, while week 1 was what, third zone of having a dragon?
[1:33:15] Scraggersmeh: @R2RHIN0 you need an 18 to get a 15 next week
[1:33:23] mewkittymon: The way dragon flying is now I will not be able to play the game I
[1:33:49] matching_towels: People also upset over no LFR slime mount too, some say raids shouldn’t have so much trash. Which if blizzard acted on would actually remove a lot of the extra effort they put in to make large raid maps
[1:33:49] SeckSymbols: @mewkittymon You wont be able to play the game? Thats a weird and interesting take
[1:33:50] R2RHIN0: @Scraggersmeh Thanks!
[1:33:56] mewkittymon: I get sick from the flying bit .
[1:34:09] Malarick: Boomer Blast confirmed?
[1:34:40] dwolters_the_zombieman: nice
[1:34:58] Skars111: soar seems to be a very hot topic on the wow forums atm, and quite a few people have made youtube video's about it including Asmongold, @Towelliee
[1:34:58] R2RHIN0: Now that is a shaker cup! I can't stand those small ones companies seem to be so hype on making
[1:35:05] Skars111: will you ship to australia?
[1:35:05] Malarick: Nice
[1:35:07] PadidinJones: Hey @Towelliee
[1:35:11] ElDrakenMan: which company is this?
[1:35:25] KapWaller: and where can I give you my money for this??
[1:35:35] cowee12356995: LUL
[1:35:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: price is worth for the sticker alone
[1:35:51] Tjenne92: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[1:36:07] jkitchin75: take all my money
[1:36:08] R2RHIN0: oh wow that is only $15??
[1:36:23] PadidinJones: Put it on your car!
[1:36:25] dwolters_the_zombieman: my sleep pattern is all screwed up
[1:36:45] WestonTeli: for real LUL
[1:36:54] tronbadgames: i dont think thats the biggest outcry. have you seen the mage talents?
[1:37:01] R2RHIN0: Seriously, as long as the outcry is not about a major system like Shadowlands and BFA
[1:37:02] mashiesmashie: Not much outcry as there isn't much out at one time
[1:37:10] Tjenne92: mage players LUL
[1:37:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: i think they mean the time it takes to get from raid to raid
[1:37:25] TheTazzyBoy: ah yes ima speed run pet battling
[1:37:25] Eutopia: @SeckSymbols checkmate lmao
[1:37:27] SeckSymbols: I view that as a means of overworld travel, getting to raids for transmog. I think the author of the article worded shit weird
[1:37:30] Eutopia: YUUP
[1:37:31] zenkodac: i assume they mean going between raids not in the raids
[1:37:35] PadidinJones: Wait are drakthyr leather or mail?
[1:37:37] theoriginalzinng: i would probably say there are less people doing pet battles then there are people doing mythic raids
[1:37:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: exactly
[1:37:40] zenkodac: i agree
[1:37:41] valarbravoosi: that, in my professional opinion, is what they refer to as bullshit
[1:37:46] WestonTeli: the timed chromie quests maybe
[1:37:48] Eutopia: They don't even play the game lmao
[1:37:51] jussihenrikm: its not even true. Mages are faster with teleports..
[1:37:53] Armdel: blizzard apparently
[1:37:57] Retpally9329: The devs for some reason
[1:37:58] Tharia: ^
[1:37:58] Skars111: chromie doesnt make sense, when dracthyr start at lvl 58? and leave starting zone at 60 haha no use for it completely trivial
[1:37:58] jussihenrikm: They sound so disconnected or lying
[1:37:59] cowee12356995: BabyRage but you can tmog farm faster
[1:38:03] SeckSymbols: @Eutopia Doesnt disprove my point as I said they didnt say dungeons, Ctrl F the article and you will see dungeons isnt in the article. checkmate lmao
[1:38:10] yalkman: it doesnt matter if they gave a good reason. opinions aren't original, its all reddit comment parrots
[1:38:11] Alienfromger: but why
[1:38:12] PadidinJones: Yes
[1:38:15] WestonTeli: i don't remember lol
[1:38:17] jussihenrikm: you cant use it in instances
[1:38:20] theoriginalzinng: isnt soar like a 5 min cd too?
[1:38:20] NEMERL: Yop its a bad reason to nerf it, whodeas pet battles or chromie time today KEKW
[1:38:20] Retpally9329: what advantage? it's questing
[1:38:21] aminus: can you do chromie time as a dracthyr???
[1:38:21] SeckSymbols: @Eutopia Also, still doesnt disprove because the author just worded shit stupidly and should have kept it about overworld travel
[1:38:26] theoriginalzinng: yeah wtf
[1:38:29] Greencaps07: whats the different with just log a alt at the entrance of the raid
[1:38:51] Alepouditsa: maby the can make it with lvl insted
[1:38:54] Trobbels: MrGM KEKW
[1:38:57] Awikan: Poor Chromie not getting that action
[1:39:00] BigJoeChestnut: it's like they saw people having fun and said nope none of that now
[1:39:01] JokaThS: what chromie they start at 58 lvl
[1:39:02] ElDrakenMan: im leveling a mage right now in chromie
[1:39:03] Skars111: chromie doesnt make sense, when dracthyr start at lvl 58? and leave starting zone at 60 haha no use for it completely trivial, and its mainly only used for lvling? @Towelliee
[1:39:05] aminus: YOU CAN WALK ON THE WATER
[1:39:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: i tried the chromie time shit once, said this is dumb and never did it again
[1:39:09] Shaele: KEKW
[1:39:10] xhaven: sorry but many are currently doing Chrromie..me included lol
[1:39:13] Eutopia: KEKW
[1:39:16] zenkodac: i agree it doesnt matter, people will complain in the forums they feel its mandatory to have a dracthyr thou, but honestly thats a minority blizz has to know they have no need to appease them
[1:39:17] dwolters_the_zombieman: I don't do chromie instances
[1:39:18] WestonTeli: ....
[1:39:18] R2RHIN0: Chromie time is great for rares. I got all the WoD Rare Mounts back to back while leveling in Chromie time with warmode on
[1:39:24] SeckSymbols: @MuzkaTV As a max level character, you can still do chromie stuff
[1:39:26] Tjenne92: looking at you ZUCC
[1:39:43] net_mi: What? did blizz confirm aliens on earth?
[1:39:47] Rudric_Ice: weren't u talking about the soar nerf the other day and u were laughing at people complaining about the change KEKW ?
[1:40:16] Kickack: Just gotta pre-order
[1:40:21] Skars111: @SeckSymbols yes you can but at max lvl it's completely tivial, wheres the advantage in trivial content?
[1:40:25] SeckSymbols: They already did kinda confirm it would come to all zones, right? Just definitely not at launch
[1:40:31] MrTheColor9: or they kill it all togeather
[1:40:36] SeckSymbols: @MuzkaTV Flight speed, the entire reason for Soar

[1:40:39] Aervyper: @Towelliee the dragon race sounds kool but lets be honest it's going to be hell on guilds.... only 3-5 can play the cool new race as mains int he next xpac
[1:40:41] Tjenne92: vaniclysm ?
[1:40:41] zysmos: just allow dragonriding everywhere, easiest smartest best decision
[1:40:42] WestonTeli: just turn soar into worgen mount/run. EZ
[1:40:52] zenkodac: yea enabling dragon riding in all the zones would be the most obvious and simple solution
[1:40:56] winchez_: i just want to know why cant demon hunters fly lol
[1:40:58] WestonTeli: it's already built in dragon riding
[1:41:13] FutileDiploma: When is ILVL raised in retail this month?
[1:41:16] SeckSymbols: @Aervyper I have never met a guild who gave a shit about what race you place
[1:41:20] Skars111: @SeckSymbols what bonus are you going to get out of completeing a quest quicker than someone else?

[1:41:43] SeckSymbols: @MuzkaTV Speed, the entire point of what soar does is speed. Doing things faster for your own sake
[1:41:45] Scraggersmeh: @MuzkaTV That it takes you less time than them?
[1:42:01] Rudric_Ice: how much heroic jailer going for ? i might just buy one today
[1:42:03] dwolters_the_zombieman: they could just make it like flight form for druids

[1:42:06] theoriginalzinng: drop that gold
[1:42:09] Aervyper: @SeckSymbols i've met guilds that give a shit about who mains how many classes and doesn't the dragon race only have one class?

[1:43:42] Skars111: @SeckSymbols but if your holding that argument its still irrelevant as its still faster with the nerf wich makes blizzards reasoning not make sense
[1:43:54] tronbadgames: right now
[1:43:55] Kneckt: right now right now
[1:43:57] Aervyper: @SeckSymbols so  you can raid with 20 evokers?

[2:12:26] Nazz_1138: you can upgrade tier
[2:12:27] quakegoogl: towBeer
[2:12:29] Yurian33: tier does
[2:12:30] aminus: tier is new item level ye
[2:12:34] SeckSymbols: Leggos dont

[2:12:38] bonkyouded: catalyst will be able to turn m+ and vault to tier
[2:12:39] Zendero89: same way as now..
[2:12:39] PvtHudson093: catalyst works on fated gear
[2:12:41] dimofodi: only leggos stay the same
[2:12:43] subversv: catalyst
[2:12:47] Mecabeast: no all pieces can be converted at the catalyst same mats as before and no mat reset
[2:12:50] Nazz_1138: cosmic flux
[2:12:53] subversv: you keep your charges too @Towelliee of the catalyst

[2:13:07] Nazz_1138: SI

[2:13:12] AveragePvp: Same as before , and your catalyst is not resetting so you keep your saved up charges
[2:13:12] mavericks312: are there gonna be new color ways for the upgraded tier?
[2:13:27] SeckSymbols: 278
[2:13:28] Molvonos: Yep
[2:13:29] doomester: yes
[2:13:31] Mecabeast: 278
[2:13:32] SeckSymbols: It still keeps the ilvl
[2:13:33] theoriginalzinng: dungeon gear also converts and is upgradeable with valor
[2:13:40] SeckSymbols: Once you get Heroic nathria gear, then you can upgrade that
[2:13:42] PvtHudson093: So think of all the higher ilvl gear from the last 2 or 3 bosses in every raid
[2:13:45] dimofodi: dungeon gear also converts
[2:13:48] magemaster225: no cap on dungeons, its dungeon spam all week
[2:13:52] Mecabeast: mythic fated raid would be 304/311
[2:13:54] Yurian33: works on dungeon gear
[2:13:56] Molvonos: And they're removing Domination Socketed Gear from SoD.
[2:13:57] Nazz_1138: S4 gear is supposed to be convertible too
[2:13:57] Koosalakoopakoop: I hope Bobby Kotick has a bright, sunny day today and has some delicious coffee this morning :) <3

[2:14:25] Theduskflyer: !?!?
[2:14:28] Rottencoarse: nope
[2:14:30] KydSage: nope
[2:14:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: One interesting thing is that a corresponding world boss is going to have increased item level rewards each week
[2:14:34] Mecabeast: sandworm will still be 246 I think
[2:14:36] icerasta: Mythic is 304. Heroic is 291
[2:14:39] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  there are no shield or wepaons for the relics
[2:14:50] Milanesa_De_Pollo: no sandworm weapons, only cypher weapons and they are only 252
[2:14:54] Mitune: is Sandworm gear going up in ilvl or is there going to be new gear that is higher?
[2:15:00] Milanesa_De_Pollo: and takes many weeks of grinding
[2:15:03] mavericks312: @rottencoarse or trinks as well right
[2:15:05] KydSage: @Mitune  neither
[2:15:09] dimofodi: Relic gear isn't getting an ilvl jump and if it is I just wasted 4k relics getting all the appearances :D :D
[2:15:21] TechVenoM: TechVenoM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! <3
[2:15:23] Rottencoarse: @mavericks312 yeah no trinks as well

[2:15:36] Mitune: ok then I guess I heard wrong but that is actually good for me then lol @SadgeKydSage
[2:15:38] bonkyouded: can't wait to kill denathrius PepoDance
[2:15:46] PvtHudson093: it could be really easy or really ahrd
[2:15:59] avellan94: 4-5
[2:16:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: If the world bosses reward a 278 ilvl piece that would be nice
[2:16:00] KydSage: @Mitune  yeah sandworn relics are just BoA now so its easier to get tier on alts and etc
[2:16:01] mavericks312: how ignored will SoD be week 2 lol

[2:16:40] ronox9: all three will be unlocked as fated at all times
[2:16:47] mavericks312: @molvonos forgot about the jelly cat
[2:16:48] SeckSymbols: Thats not confirmed
[2:16:48] Mecabeast: @towelliee you guys gonna skip to sire then clear the wings?
[2:16:49] h116_: they said they will make them all available  at the end

[2:18:07] stabzmcgeee: while they are at it they should add the AOTC and CE mounts to LFR
[2:18:10] PvtHudson093: LFR is a good way of finishing off any bossed you missed in Higher difficulties to get your first dinar
[2:18:15] Funderik: they shouldn't, what's the point, might aswell be given on login at that point.
[2:18:15] dwolters_the_zombieman: slime cat for the word
[2:18:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Slime cat!
[2:18:25] mavericks312: casuals can't even do 1 normal raid in a month let alone a week
[2:18:26] Neutrum00: @stabzmcgeee Bro stop, they shot themselves in the foot announcing it so late
[2:18:35] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @mavericks312 i am hoping so but I usually haver bad luck with this lol.
[2:18:38] Milanesa_De_Pollo: The hardest part about doing Normal would be joining the raids, not actually doing them LUL
[2:18:42] JediNeo99999: They posted the affixes last week
[2:18:45] Kriven: 49ers, WR Deebo Samuel agree to three-year contract extension worth up to $73.5 million. Dayum
[2:19:01] gooball_tv: @Kriven sheeeesh
[2:19:08] SeckSymbols: There was a post that explained the different affixes
[2:19:11] KaisenSiru: Oh yeah. I wonder who will do those videos now
[2:19:11] PvtHudson093: rip videos
[2:19:13] mavericks312: @kriven underpaid tbh
[2:19:23] h116_: they said because they want the end of expansion "friendship" groups to happen, thing is before it was for 1 boss only, not 3 full raids
[2:19:27] QuigsTV: not lore :(
[2:19:53] Kriven: @mavericks312 fine with me i needs these guys to get paid less lol We gotta pay burrow, chase and higgins in the next few years
[2:20:09] Yurian33: lore went to work for the devil??
[2:20:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: I liked those survival guide videos
[2:20:27] klindatu: the problem is the achievement text for the fated raids says "on any difficulty" so many players will open tickets tomorrow because thy dont get progress from LFR
[2:20:27] Kriven: @Yurian33 No he LEFT activision  BAZINGA
[2:20:29] Bernardo994: Bernardo994 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[2:20:34] mavericks312: @kriven oh Bengals are losing one of chase or higgins I would think
[2:20:35] h116_: exactly, but that's what they said
[2:20:47] Yurian33: tictok worse
[2:20:48] Milanesa_De_Pollo: people do friendship raids now, it just costs gold to join them
[2:20:58] klindatu: no its on live
[2:21:01] Butmamasaid: no says it right now check
[2:21:03] h116_: you can check the achievement on live
[2:21:03] Kriven: @mavericks312 I doubt it. We are low balling our safety right now to save money for them
[2:21:12] dimofodi: @Towelliee the achievements are on live already and say any difficulty
[2:21:12] Funderik: not all datamined stuff can be trusted, the lfr andys will learn this ;)
[2:21:44] Neutrum00: It doesn't
[2:21:46] smashwow: but then the blue post says normal or higher @Towelliee
[2:21:53] kaburanx: can be on normal i think
[2:22:01] kaburanx: lfr even maybe
[2:22:07] dwolters_the_zombieman: that's not really a friendship raid is it then it's more like paid runs
[2:22:09] Rudric_Ice: this proves it blizzard doesn't consider LFR an actual raid difficulty
[2:22:16] Neutrum00: @dwolters_the_zombieman Agreed
[2:22:29] Kickack: LFR was such a fun addition, allowed me to do emerald dream
[2:22:32] PvtHudson093: LFR is its own difficulty KEKW
[2:22:35] kaburanx: I would do it on heroic just in case if possible
[2:22:44] Retpally9329: Lets be honest LFR is harder than normal
[2:22:53] gooball_tv: what can you do with the relics?
[2:22:56] smashwow: LFR is the endgame
[2:22:58] dimofodi: Hell the portals should come from LFR not Mythic, that's where the real difficulty is. :D
[2:22:59] gooball_tv: thought they were useless
[2:23:04] stabzmcgeee: well it take back my previous statement,, if its worded like that in the acheive in game then it should be in LFR
[2:23:05] Awesm_mossm: dont matter to me i only have time to do lfr
[2:23:06] Mitune: I mean who cares if LFR people get a mount
[2:23:10] smashwow: it's probably more difficult then mythic sometimes Kappa
[2:23:11] Mecabeast: it's a text error in game because the achievement was created before they changed their mind to allow fated to be lfr
[2:23:14] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Make normal queueable after a month or so of content release
[2:23:14] TheGiant99: If they made Normal where you can que and get into more people would do it.
[2:23:16] Kickack: @Towelliee did you boost your character on SWTOR?
[2:23:16] Thoreya: deshaun watson suspended 6 games
[2:23:22] Rudric_Ice: just remove LFR and make Normal the new LFR
[2:23:25] Kriven: only six thats a crime
[2:23:31] matching_towels: LFR afk people drive me crazy
[2:23:40] gooball_tv: Ravens Nation!
[2:23:45] Kriven: hopefully roger ups thats to 10 or a year
[2:23:50] stabzmcgeee: @Neutrum00 i'll take the L on that one,, didnt know it was worded like that
[2:23:54] mavericks312: so gambling is a bigger no no then sexual abuse to the nfl lol
[2:23:57] TheGiant99: If Normal had a que like LFR more would do it
[2:23:59] dwolters_the_zombieman: between all the shadowlands raid mounts I would love to get is the slime cat mount
[2:24:05] Awesm_mossm: should be the season
[2:24:07] JediNeo99999: The hate on LFR makes no sense. If you ignore it literally doesn't affect you and some people like having the option.
[2:24:24] rohdey: First of the Month, wake up wake up, get your hearthstone rewards, get up get up
[2:24:34] tronbadgames: @Towelliee you have to do all the raids fated.. so they cant get it tomorrow

[2:52:36] jerexify: We just ran TW Grimrail Depot last night and failed because 2 people didn't know how to do the train boss and they were the only 2 60s in the group who already had gear. M+ is gonna be garbage.

[2:55:39] theoriginalzinng: OWS is still really good even after the nerf
[2:55:42] PvtHudson093: Mech rings will be bis and just beat out having 2 322 ilvl rings

[2:55:54] thiccsushi: OWS is still going to be used with the 10% nerf lol
[2:55:56] theoriginalzinng: instead of like 10% haste at max stacks its like 9%
[2:56:02] theoriginalzinng: so yeah still good
[2:56:03] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Ruby Life Pools - NEW Dungeon in Dragonflight - Prot Paladin Gameplay youtu.be/yFyQAB2fI50

[2:56:20] Vaedrun: you cant see because its m+ i think
[2:56:44] Tatuatul: Go for a m0
[2:56:46] Tanker01: can someone please tell me, if you can also buy these trinkets from the vendor by doing m+ ?? cause all my guys dont raid.. only m+
[2:57:04] adrian_fell: didnt relics share loot table with the rest of the loot?
[2:57:22] Holysal: you have to raid to get raid gear
[2:57:23] Cy_n_: do they have the mythic+ value out somewhere per level?
[2:57:26] stabzmcgeee: @Tanker01 currency comes form raid
[2:57:26] PvtHudson093: @Tanker01 you need to kill raid bosses to get a dinar to buy raid trinkets/weapons
[2:57:27] smashwow: we had that in Sotfo though
[2:57:33] DarkArch3r: think so
[2:57:37] raye_gaming22: yes but they are bad cuz of the tier set
[2:57:50] smashwow: yeah the wrists are a thing again from what i keep hearing
[2:57:51] Tigerklaue: @Tanker01 you can do the raid on lfr for the quest
[2:58:00] Mecabeast: I'm wondering if HOA will work in m+ outside of tazevesh
[2:58:10] Tanker01: thx for the reply.. and that sux... i thought blizzard dont want to force player to do something specific?? i only want to rush m+ ... maybe in dragonflight then
[2:58:29] metavahn231: all we need is fresh start servers
[2:58:31] Elff11: @Mecabeast Does in TW so I guess yes because its outside of SL
[2:58:37] PvtHudson093: @Tanker01 you can still do LFR and get the dinar that way
[2:59:08] fillefaren: The rings in mechagon is gonna fucking slap @Towelliee
[2:59:09] PvtHudson093: yup
[2:59:13] soulbound8168: i the fated version of  the raid a way harder version ?
[2:59:25] raye_gaming22: as a lether class you can be almost full 311 ecept rings and neck
[2:59:31] Holysal: @Tanker01 they want ppl to raid. its the games main content. so it will always be this way
[2:59:36] Strik3r019: @Towelliee what are your thoughts on the group loot thing being considered again?
[2:59:42] Tanker01: @PvtHudson093 i dont want to raid sadly. i hate raiding in wow. it take tooo much time.
[3:00:12] Tanker01: @Holysal according to blizz, it is not :D  or maybe not in dragonflight D:
[3:00:14] Vaedrun: Guess there will be no RWF events this time :p
[3:00:16] Lataran: are there plans for rep being account wide?
[3:00:29] FrankTizzle: @lataran no

[3:00:45] Holysal: thinks
[3:00:49] Strik3r019: i hope there will be a personal loot option for pugs tho
[3:00:59] raye_gaming22: the mage in my guild still crying every time i bring up FOP from mythic azhara that i could not trade on my DH and i did dissenchant lol

[3:52:52] Thoreya: ya this tree is shit
[3:52:54] spicymangobaby: @LCS01 no
[3:52:56] kreff_: blastwave fire mage in burning crusade Kreygasm
[3:53:01] LCS01: ty @CombatWombat195
[3:53:09] spicymangobaby: take the DR
[3:53:11] spicymangobaby: then shimmer
[3:53:21] tronbadgames: @Towelliee it's a lot of weird placement.. not great synergies..
[3:53:29] spicymangobaby: magic res
[3:53:31] spicymangobaby: then shimmer
[3:53:39] NEMERL: @Towelliee u can take both but no one this lvl
[3:53:42] Thoreya: they pretty much just destroyed mage utility and added nothing else
[3:53:42] spicymangobaby: it cucks you
[3:53:45] raye_gaming22: both are bis stats you need both
[3:53:52] bloowaterr: the crit is act worthless
[3:54:00] bloowaterr: that talent is garbo as frost you control your crits
[3:54:25] spicymangobaby: take TV down to time anomaly
[3:54:33] spicymangobaby: then take DB
[3:54:37] Featherbow: towOny
[3:54:54] bloowaterr: haste is your primary
[3:54:54] raye_gaming22: ou dont even ahve 33& crit oyu need crit asap
[3:55:13] raye_gaming22: not sure waht taht crazy dude is talkign about
[3:55:35] Mitune: it also takes 5 to get a capstone
[3:55:37] bloowaterr: Once you reach the crit cap tho it  has DR you will get the crit in gear i wouldnt bank a talent on it
[3:55:40] bloowaterr: when those are crucial
[3:55:51] tronbadgames: haste as a talent.. how exciting
[3:55:55] spicymangobaby: all bottom 3 row is trash
[3:56:16] spicymangobaby: 3rd last row*
[3:56:17] raldrik: wow the mage tree feels like ass. They couldnt figure out enough talents so they made everything tons of points
[3:56:18] falldrgn: @chizu_gaming He doesn't play mage primarily. Hes just going through the tree
[3:56:29] spicymangobaby: shifting is trash on frost
[3:56:30] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Ruby Life Pools - NEW Dungeon in Dragonflight - Prot Paladin Gameplay youtu.be/yFyQAB2fI50
[3:56:42] tronbadgames: shifting power is really good on fire but not great on frost
[3:56:58] MedicineMan: Frost does not have a lot of CDs
[3:56:59] NEMERL: Time anomaly is actually pog
[3:57:01] spicymangobaby: yeah
[3:57:06] raye_gaming22: @chizu_gaming im not taliign about towl iwas talkign about the guy who said "crit is worthless" taht dude is crazy or never palyed mage in gmae
[3:57:07] spicymangobaby: and take dragons breath
[3:57:09] spicymangobaby: no meteor
[3:57:12] agentblaster123: shifting is alright for frost but only for high end keys
[3:57:18] smashwow: TA is kinda meh because of the RNG
[3:57:21] h116_: there's literally 0 new stuff in the mage general tree lol, its all current spells+conduits
[3:57:29] spicymangobaby: its dog water
[3:57:32] flebbooo: this is a real sus tree KEKW
[3:57:37] Mattsta: very limited on pathing through the tree
[3:57:42] Mitune: 31
[3:57:44] MedicineMan: Yeah it's a mess lol
[3:57:47] Mitune: 31 20
[3:57:48] WundertueteGER: 31
[3:57:49] Mitune: 30
[3:57:52] Mr_Hasselhoff: I like mage
[3:57:52] tronbadgames: @Towelliee there really hasnt been ANY positive feedback on mage talents. hoping to see some rework discussion soon
[3:58:05] Manabucho: imfiredup had a easy take on this class tree when he was talking with Maximum KEKW
[3:58:06] Lostdogal: Pretty sure blizzard were trolling with this tree. Major problems with it.
[3:58:08] NEMERL: @Towelliee u can take both but no one this lvl
[3:58:15] MedicineMan: I just want a good Glacial Spike build XD
[3:58:16] spicymangobaby: big agree
[3:58:32] spicymangobaby: tbh you want alter time
[3:58:39] h116_: you can if you ignore ice block heal and blink shield
[3:58:46] Knolt: so Thats the PvP way of frost Mage ? and you dont get frost dmg spells ? weird !
[3:58:52] bloowaterr: @CombatWombat195 I agre i would go alter time route to get the haste
[3:59:03] Mitune: seems like they arent collaborating at this phase
[3:59:07] spicymangobaby: id stop at AT
[3:59:09] spicymangobaby: imo
[3:59:13] Quojin: I Blink directional now?

[4:00:07] spicymangobaby: you want to use ice lance after flurry proc
[4:00:09] Quojin: *Is Blink directional now
[4:00:21] bloowaterr: Frozen orb is gonna produce your lances all lances that are procs are crits
[4:00:32] bloowaterr: any time youj nova something and lance it .. crit
[4:00:48] tronbadgames: fingers
[4:00:52] bloowaterr: that is a crit

[4:01:32] Kickack: just gets to keep going then
[4:01:33] bloowaterr: but blizzard you can cast it and then while its doing its thing keep casting other stuff
[4:01:50] spicymangobaby: greater give you 60% DR
[4:01:52] bloowaterr: @Akermay Itss been here and there
[4:01:53] NEMERL: both
[4:02:07] h116_: yes
[4:02:18] tronbadgames: @Towelliee probably a bug, greater typically replaces
[4:02:25] KartariustheFrostMage: You can get a talent to make invis give you massive movement speed I believe @Towelliee
[4:02:27] McBayne: one should give you bigger movement speed boost with talent
[4:02:28] Zendero89: it should replace it
[4:02:30] zanches98: how do i check my dps in PTR??
[4:02:31] Zendero89: must be a bug
[4:02:52] h116_: in wod greater replaced the normal invis, now it gives you both and you cant even use both
[4:03:01] LeDerpski: @zanches98 download an addon
[4:03:17] Daarksyde: that's a lot of steak to feed a family
[4:03:30] CptBananaBits: Mooror images.
[4:03:37] zanches98: @LeDerpski my addons on ptr dosent work
[4:03:55] spicymangobaby: yes to both
[4:04:00] LeDerpski: @zanches98 on PTR they should work. Mine work just fine
[4:04:18] zanches98: @LeDerpski it dosent for me
[4:04:18] KartariustheFrostMage: @Towelliee For frost to work with that tree you basically need everything in the top section
[4:04:19] spicymangobaby: its meh
[4:04:20] McBayne: yes
[4:04:27] Zendero89: sometimes
[4:04:28] Quojin: situational
[4:04:28] kreff_: for pvp
[4:04:30] stallowned: it comes in handy
[4:04:31] tronbadgames: @Towelliee its meh. survivability
[4:04:32] Merkuriuz: if you need to soak twice ye..
[4:04:32] radkkos: meh
[4:04:35] MedicineMan: oh yeah its helpful  2 IceBlocks
[4:04:36] shinwtv: almost never used it
[4:04:37] Serlindale: Serlindale subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[4:04:41] LordZzer0: It is doble ice block if it needed
[4:04:43] Nachozdood: pvp talent mostly
[4:04:45] McBayne: its good, you basicly have 2 charges of iceblock
[4:04:48] agentblaster123: For m+ it is usually not that useful
[4:04:52] Merkuriuz: yes
[4:05:02] Merkuriuz: has nothing to do with combat or anything :D
[4:05:04] spicymangobaby: kind scuffed tho
[4:05:09] Revoca: this tree has alot of placement and connection issues... there are times where cold snap and blizzard are kinda useless but you need to get to the middle of the tree @Towelliee
[4:05:15] digitoxity: random but fun
[4:05:31] Lundrai: Time warp for crafting faster!
[4:05:34] spicymangobaby: shtter yes
[4:05:34] McBayne: everything
[4:05:36] spicymangobaby: artic yes
[4:05:39] spicymangobaby: brain freeze yes
[4:05:47] HoGoFroGo: you need snap to get to viens
[4:05:51] KartariustheFrostMage: If you want Icy Veins you need Cold Snap
[4:05:59] h116_: you have to take brain freeze and winters chill, that's basic rotation

[4:06:23] agentblaster123: brain freeze needed, yeah
[4:06:35] McBayne: ebon nah
[4:06:38] Quojin: yes
[4:06:39] Revoca: you need the middle of the tree to you have  to take blizzard and Coldsnap even if thye are kinda useless in most fights
[4:06:40] McBayne: yes
[4:06:41] agentblaster123: yeah, you dont need ebon
[4:06:41] h116_: yes, its a talent now on live
[4:06:42] LordZzer0: yea
[4:06:43] Athriox: yes
[4:06:43] flebbooo: yeeep
[4:06:45] spicymangobaby: frozen touch 100%
[4:06:47] shinwtv: crossing fingers for glacial spike being worth it again
[4:06:54] LordZzer0: and it was a talant in SL
[4:07:04] bloowaterr: You would use ebon if glacial spike build is a thing
[4:07:04] Elseworldz: @shinwtv Same. I like that ability.
[4:07:29] agentblaster123: lonely winter is a must, at least now in SL
[4:07:38] shinwtv: @shinwtv everyone loves big numbers :D
[4:07:48] spicymangobaby: lonley winter
[4:07:51] tronbadgames: lonely > ele
[4:07:58] McBayne: lonly i think
[4:08:00] Rottencoarse: lonely tbh
[4:08:00] NEMERL: lonley winter
[4:08:01] j_bar111: elemental is nice for extra frost nova
[4:08:03] kreff_: ^ yep
[4:08:04] kjdocs: yup, no ele.
[4:08:06] spicymangobaby: its also bugged
[4:08:10] spicymangobaby: it stands still
[4:08:12] in2realmz: lonely is i think
[4:08:14] raye_gaming22: it is unless hyper mass aoe
[4:08:15] tronbadgames: you'll get more value out of increased dmg more often than the ele
[4:08:20] LordZzer0: Right side is mostly AOE related
[4:08:24] kreff_: i wanted to up the lonely winter \
[4:08:29] Revoca: lonely winter side is for single more so and the other is more Aoe @Towelliee
[4:08:29] digitoxity: elemental is for extra frost nova
[4:08:44] SpoofAvatar: yes
[4:08:52] spicymangobaby: stonks
[4:08:55] tronbadgames: it's your personal lust
[4:09:18] spicymangobaby: you want flash freeze
[4:09:31] McBayne: shatering is good
[4:09:51] McBayne: artic reach\

[4:09:58] McBayne: not bliz
[4:10:04] spicymangobaby: sounds cool is trash
[4:10:14] spicymangobaby: ice nine
[4:10:34] spicymangobaby: you want TV in the middle at bottom
[4:10:42] loutre_malgache: WDYM it's trash ? It's big dps AoE and additionnal free dps single target too.
[4:10:47] ventu105: @Towelliee the best MMO streamer on Twitch
[4:10:52] QuantumleaperGG: BibleThump
[4:10:52] McBayne: skip blizz and snowstorm, go with outside
[4:10:56] zanches98: is there anything i need to do in order to get alhpa?
[4:11:09] Cooky_28: Did they nerfed Soar or not yet? I really hope they won't do that. :/ Hope they consider the feedback and reaction from announcing the action.
[4:11:09] digitoxity: my guess is the comet misses alot
[4:11:09] McBayne: comet is meh
[4:11:30] Revoca: Icy propulsion take it

[4:11:39] h116_: its still trash
[4:11:41] spicymangobaby: yes
[4:12:02] sh1asurprise: Its not trash it just was overshadowed by everything else on the talent row

[4:13:27] spicymangobaby: at vottom
[4:13:33] McBayne: skick ice an thermal void
[4:13:49] loutre_malgache: Slick ice is only for single target. Otherwise you want the other option
[4:14:09] Kickack: you live in such a dark room, must be saving power
[4:14:24] McBayne: thermal void>slic ice
[4:14:31] spicymangobaby: the other option from slick ice will be better for leveling
[4:14:38] raye_gaming22: you need the whole triangle in the middle yure hard locked
[4:14:44] Revoca: you need Thermal void too tbh
[4:14:54] spicymangobaby: he isnt 70 so he cant get both
[4:15:08] MirageNL: tauren mage Pog
[4:15:20] spicymangobaby: flurry will proc ice lance

[4:15:48] h116_: brain freeze procs reset flurry
[4:15:58] McBayne: but you have procs to rset flurry
[4:16:05] loutre_malgache: You need the 3rd capstone. it's a no brain. it makes your Icy Veins 100% uptime in dungeons
[4:16:05] spicymangobaby: read brain freeze
[4:16:15] odawgxd: Dump ice lance - fb and when u get proc, use flurry into ice lance x2
[4:16:23] H1K3_swe: the fuck do I see !? I frost cow ?! holy milk damn
[4:16:26] vic_ave: you need to be in melee for that
[4:16:28] Kasvot_Vaxt: mage used to be a lot more mixed it looks like they are trying to bring that back
[4:16:32] Kasvot_Vaxt: evocation
[4:16:34] spicymangobaby: na
[4:16:36] h116_: thats arcane
[4:16:37] spicymangobaby: thats arcance
[4:16:37] vic_ave: evoc
[4:16:38] McBayne: evocation
[4:16:38] TheItalianStallion321: evocation
[4:16:39] McBayne: no
[4:16:40] spicymangobaby: evocation
[4:16:40] Angxlic: lmao
[4:16:41] Puppette: lol
[4:16:41] in2realmz: arcane
[4:16:41] Revoca: evocation ??
[4:16:41] bloowaterr: evocation
[4:16:42] tronbadgames: evocation is arcane
[4:16:42] PvtHudson093: towCopium
[4:16:43] theoriginalzinng: thats an arcane thing
[4:16:50] theoriginalzinng: you dont use mana as any other spec
[4:16:51] h116_: you dont use mana as frost
[4:16:52] spicymangobaby: frost and fire done use mana
[4:16:53] bloowaterr: ever
[4:16:54] sh1asurprise: Frost mage doesnt go oom
[4:16:58] KartariustheFrostMage: Other mage specs don't care for mana
[4:16:58] SpoofAvatar: icy veins, frozen orb, lance and flurry when they light up. frost bolt filler
[4:16:58] MILESkg21: frost doesnt need it
[4:16:59] vagamingpanda: Frost doesn't run out of mana
[4:16:59] kimmo_gaming: Because you are not wasting mana as frost and fire
[4:17:00] Maldor313: you dont need it in frost and fire
[4:17:00] TheItalianStallion321: b/c you dont really go OOM in frost and fire
[4:17:02] loutre_malgache: You don't need evocation outside of Arcane. Your mana is cosmetic in Fire/Ice
[4:17:02] jkdh25: why is alpha phase 4 tomorrow and not today chat?
[4:17:04] in2realmz: cuz ur mana never runs lol here
[4:17:05] laito_: omg frost looks the same lmao nothing new
[4:17:06] Noulex: Cause you never run out of mana as frost or fire. Barely lose any tbh
[4:17:10] Quojin: you shouldnt be using that much mana
[4:17:11] tronbadgames: @Towelliee arcane is built around dumping and refilling mana, so it abosbed evo as part of its identity
[4:17:12] spicymangobaby: frost is 3 buttons with passives
[4:17:13] gold9871: frost is 80% passives
[4:17:14] LordZzer0: That is frost for you
[4:17:18] LordZzer0: 3 bottons
[4:17:28] TheItalianStallion321: @jkdh25 b/c tomorrow is a reset and maintenance day

[4:17:52] Lostdogal: that's frost mage, spam a few abilities and wait for procs to pop off
[4:17:59] Holysal: its a worse version than live rn tbh
[4:18:08] spicymangobaby: spam frost bolt
[4:18:10] spicymangobaby: get flurry proc
[4:18:13] spicymangobaby: use ice lance
[4:18:16] spicymangobaby: yes
[4:18:18] spicymangobaby: spot on
[4:18:19] MILESkg21: dont worry we still have like 3-4 months before beta 4Head
[4:18:22] bloowaterr: seee he mains a mage
[4:18:24] LordZzer0: Weins cast rune automaticaly
[4:18:26] spicymangobaby: ice veins will give you rune of power
[4:18:30] Armdel: spam frost bolt and press procs Kappa
[4:18:35] Milanesa_De_Pollo: weird how they have so many azerite traits, old set bonuses and torghast powers, yet they still somehow put passive % increase of stats in talents...
[4:18:36] digitoxity: get as many shatters as possible
[4:18:36] laito_: Most classes ive seen so far in beta got either returning abilities or new ones
[4:18:40] loutre_malgache: Span frostbolt. When you have overhead proc, flurry, after a flurry proc you cast 2 ice lance. when side procs you ice lance.
[4:18:42] bloowaterr: you wanna get 3 procs first then ocne you do you icy veins and dump
[4:18:48] spicymangobaby: ahaahaha
[4:18:54] Noulex: Frostbolt until FLurry then double icelance, and you can use icelance procs inbetween
[4:18:58] LordZzer0: yeap
[4:18:58] spicymangobaby: ice lance wont proc
[4:19:04] SpoofAvatar: cast frozen orb on cooldown
[4:19:04] spicymangobaby: u use it twice after flurry

[4:20:27] Musty_Kutsy: heavy rotation
[4:20:30] raye_gaming22: ignore masetry just icelance on proc
[4:20:39] j_bar111: you want to ice lance 2 times right after a flurry cast
[4:20:42] MedicineMan: Fire and Frost dont need mana anymore
[4:20:42] h116_: you don't need to pay attention to icicles
[4:20:44] loutre_malgache: @towelliee  Important, after a Flurry proc, always cast 2 ice lance. Flurry proc adds a debuff on the target that makes your 2 next ice lance deal dmgs like it's frozen.

[4:20:51] spicymangobaby: put 2 ice lance between

[4:21:33] inoru_o: when get a flurry proc use two ice lances to do shatter damage
[4:21:34] sh1asurprise: @Towelliee When you get a Flurry proc, use Frostbolt>Flurry>Ice Lance>Ice Lance, then you shaatter the frostbolt
[4:21:39] spicymangobaby: yep
[4:21:42] dormeau_1992: yes
[4:21:42] SpoofAvatar: in a nutshell, yep
[4:21:44] digitoxity: :D
[4:21:44] Rottencoarse: yep
[4:21:46] McBayne: if you have fingers of frost use icelance, keep flrry on one charge so proc dont overcap,  after flurry use 2 icelance, and when nothing frost bolt
[4:21:48] Lostdogal: yeah
[4:21:48] Kasvot_Vaxt: frost has always been pretty simple

[4:21:51] kowaikokoro: frost is extremely basic  PepeLaugh
[4:21:55] loutre_malgache: There's people here that give advice not taking in count the talents he took, like geeze people...

[4:23:14] loutre_malgache: Flurry puts a debuff that empowers you next 2 ice lances
[4:23:21] bloowaterr: everything can produce ice lances
[4:23:26] LordZzer0: @Towelliee proced Flurry make target counrs as "Frozen" for 2 spels to crit
[4:23:43] bloowaterr: Hover over your bvuffs up top right
[4:23:44] j_bar111: Brain freeze and frozen fingers are different
[4:23:46] digitoxity: winters chill lasts like 8 seconds adter flurry hits

[4:26:45] Tom__1993: how many alpha phases will there be ?
[4:26:50] mashiesmashie: I think you know it isn't coming :P
[4:26:57] Kriven: i cant see anyone rather wanting to watch season 4 over alpha
[4:27:01] zgag: I hope they don't prioritize season 4 over the new xpac
[4:27:21] zgag: Season 4 sounds fun and all, but they really need to hit DF out of the ball park
[4:27:47] Holysal: @zgag they didnt. 2 ppl worked on season 4
[4:27:54] dwolters_the_zombieman: i think there is 2 more phase yet or i might be wrong
[4:27:58] spicymangobaby: you have a shield dont foget
[4:28:00] h116_: icy veins drops a rune on the floor, you dont need to cast one
[4:28:09] Aquadriel: actually frost
[4:28:12] Wcvechten: technically, that was frost, not fire
[4:28:19] UltraContent: thats break every cc in pvp retail
[4:28:24] dwolters_the_zombieman: lol

[4:28:56] mashiesmashie: Oh, fair enough
[4:29:13] dormeau_1992: S4 ResidentSleeper
[4:29:15] d4arkk95: Wait tauren mage? You can play any race/class combination now?
[4:29:15] Kickack: Blizzard wont add that, will they?
[4:29:18] spicymangobaby: all mage major cooldowns drop rune of power. dont need to cast it
[4:29:19] mashiesmashie: Please accept my humble apologies
[4:29:33] RiptoreCA: I think Season 4 is purely experimental and more for collecting data and feedback than actually making a splash for the game
[4:29:35] whteraven_: hello good morning n_n
[4:29:44] LordZzer0: orb is mostly for lance procks
[4:29:44] PadidinJones: Do they care about season 4 though??
[4:29:58] dwolters_the_zombieman: the org might be bugged if it's not damaging anything
[4:30:04] dwolters_the_zombieman: orb
[4:30:11] Dillhouse: tauren mage? wtf?
[4:30:29] Sollice: I would also assume that Season 4 for them is important to keep people subbed to the game
[4:30:31] DeanoTV: All races can be mages, rogues and priests in DF
[4:30:47] dwolters_the_zombieman: there is tauren rogues too
[4:30:51] Kriven: LMAO ohh nfl memes https://twitter.com/NFL_Memes/status/1554111733647695872
[4:30:51] Sollice: If they had that large of a draught from 9.2.5 to DF it would have been subpocoypse again
[4:31:04] c0mmander_starscream: the chads will be reeeing alot
[4:31:04] brian_777777777: i'm back FeelsGoodMan
[4:31:27] LeBigNose: xD
[4:31:28] captiv8: A good play with frozen orb is to cast it, wait till the mobs walk out of it, and then blink to the other side of it so they walk back through it.
[4:31:33] Sarocus: Someone say item level increase? luxthoLurk
[4:31:34] iiTornTunaii: how far will this 311 gear take us into dragonflight?
[4:31:41] Holysal: @twiztidhatchet im glad :)
[4:31:44] Sollice: @twiztidhatchet That was my fault for the ban earlier. Sorry about that. I tried to message you to let you know it was removed but you werent accepting whispers
[4:31:45] SpookyJamez: 🎵 now you're raiding, for reals
[4:32:01] Templexx: lol
[4:32:11] brian_777777777: yeah i don't accept whispers people message me really chat room esque things on twitch
[4:32:17] GabCast81: LUL
[4:32:21] KartariustheFrostMage: I'm interested to see how the raids will scale up in difficulty. Ideally not to the point where progging is required again
[4:32:51] dwolters_the_zombieman: i got to wait to get paid again in order to play retail
[4:33:08] Holysal: i think it will be faceroll
[4:33:20] spicymangobaby: frost nova them in it
[4:33:21] DeanoTV: Does mythic 0 gear scale up too?
[4:33:23] Hank_Chinaski: Hey Towlliee, have you ever done a raid together with Asmongold?
[4:33:44] h116_: it changed in legion
[4:33:48] brian_777777777: frost orb ticks reduce your blizzard cd now
[4:33:50] Aquadriel: yes but was channeled no?
[4:33:52] spicymangobaby: slowed more also
[4:33:52] Joefoshow15: it use to be channel right?
[4:33:52] Pocc0420: it was a channel long time ago
[4:33:56] djdavecee: @DeanoTV i believe so yes
[4:33:59] Mecabeast: @deanotv I believe m0 will be 262
[4:34:01] tkzod: Tauren mage...the heresy
[4:34:15] centt3r: I'm really hyped for evoker, but i'm really unsure how i like the drakthyr aesthetic.
[4:34:18] DeanoTV: what about LFR?
[4:34:24] bawheid: has tauren mage always been a thing?
[4:34:36] andre_scb: warlock tomorrow?
[4:34:36] dwolters_the_zombieman: no
[4:34:37] moistree_wow: Remember to ice lance twice after flurry
[4:34:43] mavericks312: no just 1
[4:34:53] yuca247n: tauren mage? blasphemy
[4:34:54] whyabadi: Icey Veins triggers it automatically
[4:34:55] Mecabeast: @deanotv lfr will be 265 for only fated version original ilvl otherwise
[4:34:56] dwolters_the_zombieman: mage for tauren is new
[4:35:07] saevenar: they changed it so icy veins drops one instead of two charges
[4:35:12] spicymangobaby: icy veins drops one on the floor. and you can cast one
[4:35:14] KartariustheFrostMage: @Towelliee Used to be 2. Now icy veins will put one down for free
[4:35:16] DeanoTV: @Mecabeast nice one ty
[4:35:17] h116_: in legion it was 2 yes, now it's 1 because your cooldowns drop 1 auto
[4:35:21] Pocc0420: RoP had 2 charges i think, but usind ur bid CD casts one so they removed the 2 charge system
[4:35:37] Manyfist: Mooge
[4:35:52] mashiesmashie: willing to do both but ya know
[4:35:54] Reepham: im still waiting for draenei warlock Sadge
[4:35:58] X_ius: is that the default wow ui now?
[4:36:05] X_ius: well the editable one?
[4:36:08] spicymangobaby: you are leveling
[4:36:09] spicymangobaby: get it later
[4:36:12] spicymangobaby: no?
[4:36:15] Manyfist: Draenei Warlock would be funny
[4:36:25] xReadyAimMissx: gladdPEPEGA
[4:36:27] spicymangobaby: lmao
[4:36:27] Trawkey: durp
[4:36:56] whyabadi: Arcane Surge seems fun
[4:37:05] mavericks312: don't do that to yourself lol
[4:37:11] NickLeonhearth: cow mage....why does this exist... lol
[4:37:16] spicymangobaby: fire is more or less the same
[4:37:18] Joefoshow15: fire has the best tree
[4:37:19] Arocian: Arocian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! towHAMUP
[4:37:20] Kasvot_Vaxt: is the arcane rotation any different
[4:37:21] sabernn: all trees look terrible for mage atm
[4:37:22] dwolters_the_zombieman: i like fire
[4:37:23] the_bad_goat: I would love to play fire
[4:37:35] tronbadgames: @Towelliee suffers from the same problem with mage side of talents. just doesnt feel right
[4:37:47] Manyfist: What’s the lord behind Tauren mages
[4:37:52] derElten: @NickLeonhearth master of the moooltiverse
[4:37:56] Dradugun: it was content creation
[4:38:00] Manyfist: Lore-*
[4:38:04] DeanoTV: @derElten KEKW
[4:38:06] sabernn: was going to main mage in df but no longer if the talents stay the same as they are now
[4:38:23] manwesk: @Towelliee Hey have u noticed nerfed divine storm animation on wrath classic?
[4:38:27] DeanoTV: They wont stay the same, they're listening to feedback
[4:38:43] spicymangobaby: @DeanoTV i agree
[4:38:46] Elseworldz: Sounds like a snoozefest
[4:39:03] sabernn: @DeanoTV i hope so :p
[4:39:10] Armdel: i think it happens to any streamer that is known to play just one game
[4:39:11] djdavecee: I've mained Frost DK for a while now, been levelling up my 50s to 60 with buff and timewalking, really enjoyed Ele Shaman, how are they looking for DF?
[4:39:14] zenkodac: whats the video called again?
[4:39:16] mavericks312: idk the fgc is pretty bad too
[4:39:41] c0mmander_starscream: Do they cover content creators switching platforms from Twitch to Mixer than coming back to Twitch?
[4:39:54] DeanoTV: truee
[4:40:03] dracullus: I was listening to it at work, it felt like this discussion goes nowhere
[4:40:10] Dherjee: Even if it's dead just stream yourself shitting on the game and people will watch Kappa
[4:40:17] Armdel: a good bit of the largest streamers today started as wow streamers so
[4:40:18] spicymangobaby: pls use ur shield Mr. Towelliee
[4:40:52] dracullus: Josh has some weird grudge against wow, you can tell from his videos
[4:40:57] h116_: who made this video you're talking  about?
[4:41:04] MILESkg21: some are just echo chambers
[4:41:05] mavericks312: cough ff14 cough lol
[4:41:16] PadidinJones: WoW will never be slaves!!!
[4:41:24] ThatGuyFayde: League
[4:41:28] dormeau_1992: League of legends extreme toxic community
[4:41:41] zenkodac: for sure, but in mmos tribalism has always been big, because people care about playing a well or even the most populated games
[4:41:50] hatefulangel97: Is it true, that wow has the most toxic and whiny fanbase?
[4:41:51] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[4:42:02] c0mmander_starscream: The turbo neckbeards of the world unite
[4:42:13] NickLeonhearth: wow community dont protect WoW, we shit on it all the time :D @Towelliee
[4:42:23] sliproach: @Towelliee tribe rise up!
[4:42:33] Lundrai: People are tribalistic in general

[4:42:37] TheItalianStallion321: YOU CAN DO EEEETT
[4:42:49] zenkodac: and there are no mmos that have reached and brought as many people into gamiing then wow
[4:42:53] c0mmander_starscream: The Knights of Asmonite rise up
[4:42:54] cahoots82: are those default nameplates?
[4:42:57] Lundrai: The Tauren casting animations are pretty good tho fr
[4:42:58] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[4:43:02] h116_: it's like "i've spend so much time on this game that i cant tolerate you talking shit about it because that means i've been wasting my time and i don't want to hear that"
[4:43:06] zenkodac: wow made gamers out of people who never even touched a game before
[4:43:37] h0peleSsCase: this frogs looks amazing
[4:43:49] Kasvot_Vaxt: they need to make mages use their staves and not just be stat sticks ITS BEEN ALMOST 20 YEARS
[4:43:51] manwesk: @Towelliee Hey have u noticed nerfed divine storm animation on wrath classic?
[4:43:57] Chonchi4Life: Do Tauren Rogue Animations look ok?
[4:43:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dragon frog!
[4:44:02] Boosti661: I also think most people only have time for one game so that factors in
[4:44:09] loutre_malgache: What's the name of the video ?
[4:44:11] zenkodac: 100% cant deny that market is more competitive now, imo if wrath had a game like the modern ff14 out at the time it wouldnt have gotten as big as it did
[4:44:17] LordZzer0: @Towelliee btw you can cast lances after ice nova cos target is frozen and it wil crit. Smth around 2 lances will break CC
[4:44:25] phocho: everyone is entitled their own opinion, different strokes for different folks.  other's opinion shouldn't hinder your view of the game you enjoy playing
[4:44:27] NickLeonhearth: So...longer than a movie...im gonna pas on that
[4:44:28] Nehcrom: Yeah good video listened to it this morning.
[4:44:31] StureNorth: I am considering making MMO oriented content right now :>
[4:44:32] LeBigNose: :O
[4:44:37] Armdel: josh strife hayes latest video
[4:44:55] Darkstar_Universe: i feel like its deff popular but not as profitable as the other games with less investment.
[4:44:55] StureNorth: There is so much cool tech and cultural impact made before and from MMOS
[4:45:05] Weelad_x: I feel like lost ark was kinda huge

[4:45:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: oh you're playing that diablo immortal
[4:45:35] Lasidor: YOU STREAM DUCK HUNT!?!?
[4:45:35] Finiin: I think if the right MMO came out it could be popular again
[4:45:36] sliproach: @Towelliee Tribalism is just human nature, it's the same with sports teams we all have to be part of something

[4:47:04] mashiesmashie: Scares me that the gaming industry might just give up on MMOs
[4:47:11] bloowaterr: Yeah lost ark is doing just fine and easily the second top played mmo right now

[4:48:46] Danskis30: black wood
[4:48:47] yuca247n: blackwood
[4:48:49] Nostoroth: Morning wood
[4:48:49] Holysal: so was high isle a failure then?
[4:48:49] vic_ave: bleakwood?
[4:48:53] fuike: Morning Wood
[4:48:53] Alienfromger: bound to one game is  always high risk as a streamer
[4:48:54] c0mmander_starscream: it had alot of wood
[4:48:59] CloudPants8081: 420
[4:49:12] ventu105: Blackwood @Towelliee
[4:49:34] Gillyman333: cs streaming?
[4:49:36] Snabido: Wonder if the new elder scroll will have an impact on ESO
[4:49:44] Nostoroth: wtb wildstar
[4:50:07] cahoots82: WIldstar private servers are out there, but they're... lacking
[4:50:13] dracullus: wow died in 2021, you don't watch youtube?
[4:50:18] bloowaterr: @Sky_V22 goo look at the njumbers they solved the bot thing they are much lower numbers and no more que times
[4:50:23] Dherjee: People who play ESO for the world and the lore will jump ship, ye
[4:50:31] ZetYokai: huh
[4:50:47] Sollice: Deshaun Watson suspended for 6 games. Surprised he didnt get an entire season
[4:50:48] Mattsta: WoW also seems to have bigger surges of viewer numbers with new content compared to other MMOs
[4:50:50] Sollice: !yt
[4:50:51] Moobot: @Sollice Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Ruby Life Pools - NEW Dungeon in Dragonflight - Prot Paladin Gameplay youtu.be/yFyQAB2fI50
[4:50:59] dracullus: BfA had ton of them just like SL
[4:51:09] Badziee: KEKW
[4:51:11] biofreaks: I miss Star Wars Galaxies (pre cu).the game was ahead of its time...
[4:51:15] CodyKane: @Sollice  6 games.. thats it?
[4:51:15] Badziee: true dat
[4:51:18] bloowaterr: Playing an mmo is waking up dailys weeeklys and then sleep its how much you enjoy the chore more then the others
[4:51:19] MILESkg21: only 6 games wtf KEKW
[4:51:28] mashiesmashie: Haven't watched a lot of Bellular recently, he's been streaming more than making focused videos
[4:51:36] Sollice: That's it. I wonder if him settling with some many women helped it be only 6
[4:51:38] Mattsta: @biofreaks big agree
[4:51:40] Finiin: Belluar is the king of that lol
[4:51:44] h116_: oh, he'll find something to shit on, i have no doubt it my mind
[4:51:49] stoecx: how has the story been?
[4:51:54] LordZzer0: they ate not shiting YET. He is waiting to strike
[4:51:59] jeflag: bellular is our canary
[4:52:00] sliproach: oh i just thought he stopped making videos but apperently youtube hides positive belular videos
[4:52:02] CodyKane: Im sure it helped for sure, i was really expecting a full season tbh
[4:52:09] Armdel: just gotta get over the DF honeymoon phase it'll all be back
[4:52:12] Sollice: I think most people were
[4:52:19] bloowaterr: This an dlost ark are my favs right now but i play final fantasy eso and albion . Which albion has a really good niche on pvp i think  the best . Lost ark i think does alts better than any game and you really feel like you touch every bit of content they have to offer . FF best MSQ.,Eso the most casual friendly
[4:52:25] j_hooligan: At least with DF you don’t here the phrase “pull the rip cord” as you did with SL
[4:52:28] CodyKane: thats pretty wild
[4:52:35] Nomad_Manny: Nomad_Manny subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 65 months! Happy Monday to all !! Hammers Up !
[4:52:43] Djfarmville: Are the NA servers coming up in 1hr?
[4:52:57] zenkodac: i mean every other title of his videos are "is wow dying?!" in all caps
[4:53:01] SpoofAvatar: click bait titles
[4:53:06] Sollice: Next Time on Dragonball Z.....
[4:53:07] SlapaH03: dont forget the soy face
[4:53:10] Snabido: Imagine if the DF version of MT is dragonriding 👀 👀
[4:53:16] Snabido: *mage tower
[4:53:16] kokochris: "wow dead before dragon flight releases ?"
[4:53:17] PokerFaceMoose: honestly that is how I always say question mark
[4:53:19] ShowDUH: @Djfarmville they are not offline lol
[4:53:25] Moriturx: lol
[4:53:29] Tac2cul2: sounds like the oak island narrator
[4:53:29] hatefulangel97: people have said wow is dying since tbc
[4:53:33] Eredestra: I just want a fat dragon COCKA :(
[4:53:39] sh4d0wsky: wow is ded :f
[4:53:45] TheCheeseWheel87: Sounding like a belullar video now lol
[4:53:47] Mecabeast: I waiting on some dragon ball z meme videos for dragon flight lol
[4:53:47] DramaticTv: can you move the cast bar @Towelliee
[4:53:48] h116_: well, for years people ask for less systems, when there's less systems people ask if that's  it
[4:53:52] zenkodac: LUL
[4:53:54] zenkodac: always
[4:53:58] ZuggSpeedman: wtf Blizzard??!?
[4:53:59] im_n0t_jezus: Yep
[4:54:07] tronbadgames: "blizzard... ???"
[4:54:07] Djfarmville: @Showduh Doesnt NA reset at this time?
[4:54:08] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee he literally has a video that came out yday "Why?"
[4:54:09] Dradugun: gotta work that algorithm yo
[4:54:12] LordZzer0: "Blizzard did it again..."
[4:54:13] zenkodac: extra points for the ! before the ?
[4:54:21] ShowDUH: @Djfarmville tomorrow yes
[4:54:25] im_n0t_jezus: people in general dont know wtf they want really LUL
[4:54:32] Djfarmville: aaah
[4:54:36] skyelez: This systems are fine, but feeling like you "Half to do it" or your left behind kinda sucks
[4:54:39] zenkodac: KEKW
[4:54:42] Holysal: i see alot of ppl raid logging
[4:54:52] Sollice: @i__tv They have said every zone will have ZM level of content I thought
[4:54:52] brian_777777777: i already felt that way, after i got AOTC i needed something to push me into mythic
[4:55:02] Kriven: im ok with no power base stuff to grind the only thing  I dont like is the lack of new abilities for my characters. Just reused old stuff
[4:55:03] thebakeriscomingforu: BFA into Shadowlands it seemed like every guild I joined collapsed. coxThump
[4:55:04] iM1KE_: why cant dracthyr look like sendrax
[4:55:05] Alepouditsa: mostly the raider and mythic are the compalniners, coz or altas as a person who plays with only 2 or 3 i love systems
[4:55:13] superpudd: I just built a boomie build on the calculator for the first time and holy shit
[4:55:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: me personally i like having more time to play other games, raid logging is easier for me when i am at work 10 hours a day and only get a few hour a day and weekends to play
[4:55:15] yuca247n: wait what was that again?
[4:55:27] FeralLikeMe: tell them to grind  professions
[4:55:34] mojusk: some likes a carrot to chase, some just let the carrot rot
[4:55:36] PvtHudson093: Stupid Sexy Wrathion
[4:55:37] Sollice: Oh. Vault items tomorrow. Will they be at fated or pre-fated ilvl?
[4:55:40] Bilzy_TV: Its better for players who like to take breaks from wow and come back without catching up imo
[4:55:42] yuca247n: about not having to grind something?
[4:55:49] iM1KE_: if dracthyr could tank they should look like sandrax lol
[4:55:51] DigitalChill: not 'THAT' majordomo
[4:55:57] sliproach: @mojusk prefer carrot cake
[4:56:02] Dherjee: @Sollice 278 max i believe
[4:56:08] Kriven: i would have rather them make new talents and abilities over re using old stuff
[4:56:13] Hoxza: i think professions will be the new grind, but it will not be directly connectied to your characters power which is kinda nice
[4:56:18] Funderik: if no system means they can use the time they should of spent balancing system on making new content instead, it would go either way.
[4:56:32] dracullus: SL had no grind, but it had overcomplicated systems
[4:56:42] xRezzylol: We need twilight dev in out class trees
[4:56:47] xRezzylol: Our
[4:56:51] DigitalChill: that dragon just helicoptere'd off\
[4:56:53] Moonphire: If you wanna grind, check out those that are trying to collect everything in the game. That stuff is nuts.
[4:56:54] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[4:56:56] sweetcallibersog: so covanant will be nothing in dragon ?
[4:56:56] Dherjee: @dracullus eh, renown was a semi grind for conduit slots
[4:56:57] Bernardo994: They bake what worked into talents
[4:57:01] c0mmander_starscream: VHS
[4:57:03] vic_ave: Hollywood Video
[4:57:06] Mecabeast: be kind rewind
[4:57:08] kokochris: don't forget the rewind !
[4:57:09] mashiesmashie: I have been doing the Legion order hall quests for my alts, some of the appearances are amazing
[4:57:12] EclipseDTP: "Be kind,rewind."
[4:57:22] Mattsta: it is kindof like video tapes...we kindly rewind when we return em
[4:57:23] Kriven: well not all
[4:57:25] c0mmander_starscream: "Be Kind,Please Rewind" -Blockbuster
[4:57:26] rohdey: @Towelliee remember when you said 10.0 will be 'weird?' what part of it were you referring to if you can say now
[4:57:30] Mibd2010: So no late fee right
[4:57:38] tronbadgames: shifting power is covenant
[4:57:45] cyberklinos: I'm old enough to remember bringing back rented videos omg
[4:57:45] LordZzer0: Conduits
[4:58:00] Kriven: no mirrors for mages
[4:58:13] Butmamasaid: you HAVE to grab time warp LUL
[4:58:15] sliproach: bet blockbuster would like to rewind to when they decide onlien video wasn't the future
[4:58:22] alvein88: I think this is objectively better and respects players time more, although I understand how people with a lot of time on their hands would like to grind some power.
[4:58:24] Finiin: me and my gf i was with right after HS use to go every week to blockbuster to rent videos
[4:58:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: my local video store was $2 a night was great, i played the japanese smash brothers before I even knew it was called smash brothers
[4:58:39] Snabido: Bring back WoD legendary ring mechanic Kappa
[4:58:45] Nokterian: Im having fun right now with Fire Mage hope it will be just as good in dragonflight
[4:58:45] Kriven: radiant spark was so boring in shadowlands sorta mad they brought it back
[4:59:00] Lundrai: bring back twilight devastation lol
[4:59:08] ZetYokai: DF looks like a good multi spec expac, only reason i hate borrowed power, playing multiple specs fucked you big time
[4:59:19] riicksen: Who won the turnament for a few days ago?
[4:59:22] brian_777777777: legion didnt have any loot problems in M+ either
[4:59:23] ventu105: @Towelliee Im a BM Hunter looking for Exotic pets in game today lol expecialy core hound need 2 more to have them all
[4:59:24] Funderik: mmo's are designed to waste your time. games are designed to waste your time.
[4:59:27] PvtHudson093: Still have no idea why they kept Justiciar's Vengeance for Ret, that talent has not been picked for 3 expacs now
[4:59:31] mavericks312: this isn't a single player game stop crying about the time consumption
[4:59:39] DeanoTV: TRUE mmos SHOULD have a grind
[4:59:43] lordofmadness: I agree 100%
[4:59:46] xRezzylol: Ret pal is gonna be the best class in the game. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it.
[4:59:49] Alepouditsa: @mavericks312 that what i say
[4:59:51] ZetYokai: if you got 1h a week to play, dont play MMOs
[5:00:06] lordofmadness: an mmorpg is an investment. if you cannot commit then you simply need to find another game to play. its not your genre
[5:00:08] Snabido: What about catchups per major patch releases, is that aight
[5:00:08] akuma_46: if u have 2 hours a week to play go play cod or something without grind
[5:00:19] Godrick85: I loved it
[5:00:22] bydand87: what do you think the majority is
[5:00:27] Funderik: that's what people wanted tho
[5:00:32] dracullus: btw, any word if blizzard will keep xp bonus for retail?
[5:00:39] nezuko2486: They can't make everyone happy lol
[5:00:46] mavericks312: if you don't wanna play longer then 30 mi uses don't play mmo's. but don't cry for them to change the game to fit your 30 mi uses of gameplay
[5:00:48] bloowaterr: That was during them having bad press though
[5:00:54] ZuggSpeedman: I think the minimum time requirement should be low but you should get rewarded if you do want to grind more
[5:00:55] mojusk: the problem with borrowed power grind forced you to do content that you may not like
[5:00:58] bloowaterr: and so the vibe was gonna make everyone kinda fade it
[5:00:59] micronetic_one: yeah I don't have the time anymore for an mmo nowadays, I just play stuff like L4D2 with friends or some single players games LUL
[5:00:59] Mattsta: SL overall was very power came easy/quick and collectibles took forever
[5:01:07] tronbadgames: @Towelliee ZM was considered a success for shadowlands
[5:01:12] Biorrwolf: Is that...a Tauren Mage?
[5:01:17] Ravencro: @Towelliee did you try tauren rogue?
[5:01:22] SpammerMan: !ALPHA
[5:01:23] Moobot: @SpammerMan ALPHA PHASE 4 TOMORROW - Dracthyr Starting Zone/Thaldraszus (68-70) Gotta be Warrior week right? | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[5:01:23] raye_gaming22: thez can all 20 or them as log as im not forced to grind them as a raider
[5:01:24] Lasidor: I think Frost Mage looks quite dope, never mained a mage before, that spec looks tempting.
[5:01:29] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[5:01:37] yepclocc: any idea if theyre reverting the soar nerf? everyone is mad at it
[5:01:37] Nokterian: the new UI updates looking great
[5:01:39] xindianx: @Ravencro he did
[5:01:46] falldrgn: its an MMO.. you get out of it what you put into it
[5:01:48] Nokterian: also moved the frames to the middle finally
[5:01:51] Alepouditsa: @dangermouse93 that is were you have to think maby this game in not for you any more
[5:01:52] bydand87: is there something in mmo right that says you need to grind for 30 hours a week?
[5:02:08] holtrop: A bit of grinding is fine. Just not with the insane power rewards like soulbinds etc. Just give the player a small hp boost or something.
[5:02:10] Funderik: i've got a feeling that by the end of DF people will say it failed because there was nothing to do, then blizzard will just say fuck it, player don't know what they want, we're designing it how we want it again. the cycle repeats.
[5:02:18] Strayer_J: i pay for my sub for 0 hours a day lirikLUL
[5:02:19] Snabido: Concordance of Legionfall grind, lets go PogChamp
[5:02:21] TopBoyInnit: It feels like the problem is that people who don’t have time to hit mythic content complain that they want it in shorter time spans but it just doesn’t work like that that’s why there’s normal and heroics
[5:02:22] ChaoticPriest: That's literally what FFXIV does, and there's nothing wrong with it. YoshiP always tells people that its okay to quit and come back, or play a little bit and move on to something else
[5:02:38] mavericks312: @funderik but players don't know what they want
[5:02:49] raye_gaming22: raidlogingwas a thing sience calssic im not sure what you all are about this grinding
[5:02:52] KingSlayerYotam: WoW is more fun when it's NOT a necessity to play x amount of hours
[5:03:00] raye_gaming22: it worked just fine pree ligeon
[5:03:02] zenkodac: i mean people are losing their minds over a mount not being in lfr but instead in normal, and that its anti casual
[5:03:04] holtrop: Do content for content and not for power is a better reason IMO
[5:03:05] dracullus: people will bitch in 11.0 that we will get just few new talents and call blizz lazy
[5:03:11] woodgnomes: there are really only like 3 possible builds per spec
[5:03:31] scumlucki: @woodgnomes so much for player choice
[5:03:37] BlockishTiger: the only reason someone who plays more should be more powerful is because they've gotten more gear. it shouldn't be tied to any other factor (aside from skill ofc)
[5:03:38] LearnedSomething: how to bling your dragon
[5:03:39] Dherjee: I wonder if they are going to add patch by patch borrowed power like domination sockets in sanctum @Towelliee
[5:03:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: This expansion is going to be a banger. Good leadership at Blizzard and Team 2 finally listening to players seriously
[5:04:01] dracullus: @Dherjee yeah, it's called class set
[5:04:06] tronbadgames: it's literally alpha.. it's wild to say there are really only anything
[5:04:06] KingSlayerYotam: KingSlayerYotam subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 
[5:04:14] Biorrwolf: We just need another mmo release (Ashes) to force people to take a break, then come back in drove. Like releasing Slurm Classic after releasing Diet Slurm
[5:04:26] Mitune: I just hope they bring back the old Glyphs at some point
[5:04:32] scumlucki: i gotta do normal raids for the slime cat bummer
[5:04:35] Biorrwolf: Shameless Futurama plug
[5:04:37] mavericks312: @shutuproman let's be honest each class is gonna have a meta 90% of players are gonna follow
[5:04:45] Dherjee: @dracullus tier sets are going to be the norm again heading forward. that much is obv LUL  im just curious if they will experiment with something more
[5:04:49] Arboreuss: hows it going today @Towelliee ??
[5:04:52] KingSlayerYotam: towHAMUP
[5:04:59] mavericks312: @biorrwolf yea when ashes comes out in 2085
[5:05:12] scumlucki: IS phase 3 of the alpha coming tmrw or no?
[5:05:27] Nokterian: Mage is hella fun
[5:05:33] krakenfaces: am i seeing this right?? tauren mage? what
[5:05:34] Nokterian: also teleport to every city
[5:05:49] Zippaya: yeahm you are screwed
[5:05:50] Nokterian: LUL
[5:05:52] krakenfaces: moogic XD nice
[5:05:56] tronbadgames: @mavericks312 i dont think you get the whole idea of having 10 slots of talents to swap around
[5:05:57] Elseworldz: great name lol
[5:05:57] Biorrwolf: So just every race can be every class now?
[5:06:05] theysang: moo hard G ic

[5:06:32] scumlucki: what is lust?
[5:06:32] Biorrwolf: @sollice phew. My Boomer blood couldn't handle that
[5:06:40] Nokterian: Time Anomaly was a arcane only in the last expansions @Towelliee
[5:06:50] falldrgn: like the dancing?
[5:07:00] Strayer_J: @mavericks312 well if the ppl just look up builds on the web and use them regardless, then they shouldnt care about the talent tree, since they just mindless  take what someone gives them
[5:07:27] unholyshiz: what is card breaking
[5:07:37] Zanzarful: Opening packs of cards guys
[5:07:41] Short_Film: when did they start calling it breaking?
[5:07:55] TheCheeseWheel87: With all the talent builds to be made, i cant wait for "NOT Talented for that". gonna be epic
[5:08:07] Nokterian: oh yeah those guys buying cards and opening them on either youtube or twitch
[5:08:08] Aidler: maybe they were dancing at the same time…. lol
[5:08:32] Strayer_J: pack crackers
[5:08:33] Sollice: I collected cards in 80s/90s and I never remember the term breaking
[5:08:39] rohdey: cracking packs is what me and my mtg friends called it
[5:08:40] Zettabyte: The breaking point Kappa
[5:08:49] Moonphire: The MLB community on Twitch is awesome as well.
[5:08:58] Mecabeast: I would of thought unboxing
[5:09:04] Short_Film: did you get any decent players towelliee?
[5:09:15] mavericks312: @sollice we were to busy opening the packs to get the cards we wanted to give it a term
[5:09:23] Dherjee: ofc, healers are supports, they get to do all the utility 4Head
[5:09:27] scumlucki: as a dps im taking an interrupt id feel weird not having one
[5:09:32] Nokterian: @Towelliee seen the fake DH talent tree? I laughed KEKW
[5:09:34] Strayer_J: forget the baseball cards, when you opening your next pack of POGS @Towelliee
[5:09:35] Infebdo: once you get to the life pools area
[5:09:37] Dherjee: Have fun speccing interrupt on every holy pally because your dps wants more dps
[5:09:37] Sollice: @mavericks312 yep
[5:09:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some people are going to have to be the designated interrupt people, and eat the DPS loss LUL
[5:09:50] xHightopp: hey towelliee or chat im a wow noob my jailer eye thing in the maw is tier 4 howd i get that thing back down is it like a daily reset thing or sumin cant figure it out
[5:09:51] h116_: "hey can you link your build? i want to make sure you're spec'd into interrupt" lol
[5:10:00] vic_ave: wrong
[5:10:11] KingSlayerYotam: As a DH main i cant wait to press my 2 buttons for another expac
[5:10:13] GriffGoodman: highmountain tauren
[5:10:14] Strayer_J: you never heard of POGS
[5:10:15] mavericks312: what's your wish list for the yanks at the deadline towel?
[5:10:16] thekl0wn2: you dont remember pogs?
[5:10:16] RagingPunk: taurren mages? Pog
[5:10:16] Biorrwolf: As someone, and I'm sure many others, that was disappointed by the last two expansions, would you recommend coming back for DF?
[5:10:19] DeanoTV: omg pogs LUL
[5:10:22] stabbity13: plus mages always look great in COW-ls
[5:10:22] DeanoTV: i member
[5:10:27] Zinaroth: Tauren are the best race! Played Tauren Druid since Vanilla.
[5:10:27] CodyKane: did someone just say "pogs" lmao!
[5:10:28] ventu105: Undead Paladins are next @Towelliee
[5:10:34] ArcaneMaki: Different strokes for different folks.
[5:10:35] Bleedorang3: There's really a "happy medium" to be found. I for one don't mind involved, long-term grinds that reward you with "non-borrowed power" character power in the form of gear. (Gear that doesn't have a power that magically stops working next expansion)
[5:10:39] dantezalive: damn right
[5:10:39] TheCheeseWheel87: petridge farm remembers
[5:10:43] enux337: my parse
[5:10:45] neiljo: i mean depends if they want to fail

[5:10:52] h116_: "my build my choice"
[5:10:53] futomara01: ew tauren mage
[5:11:07] NickLeonhearth: a DPS that doesnt take an interupt, can leave my server at once ! escort yourself out :D
[5:11:08] jeflag: "u dont pay for my sub"
[5:11:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[5:11:16] Nokterian: We even have priest tauren now
[5:11:18] Allsee_: "You have been removed from group"
[5:11:19] hikaritd: except the classes who are forced to pick interrupt to go further down on the tree LUL
[5:11:21] Nokterian: a true Holy Cow
[5:11:25] Aidler: tauren take over everything
[5:11:30] Mecabeast: people getting kicked from lfd for not kicking lols
[5:11:33] Biorrwolf: Ready for all the Tauren Rogue pirate roleplay
[5:11:44] Arawn67: Sounds great. Not like it isn't already a nightmere trying to get groups. Nothing like adding another reason for people to reject you.
[5:11:53] scumlucki: whats phase 3 of the alpha gonna have?

[5:11:57] sliproach: you can lead a horse to interupt in there tree, dosn't mean they'll use it
[5:12:27] hikaritd: ngl DF sounds boring to me, I need some grind to make me login everyday, it has nothing like this so far :/
[5:12:35] Bleedorang3: I'm saying I wouldn't mind if it did grant power. Getting character power in the form of gear is literally 50% of what an RPG is about
[5:12:36] mavericks312: the community doesn't know what the hell it wanta
[5:12:51] helacious: Do max level mobs still slightly scales eith your ilvl i think that was introduced in legion
[5:12:53] Zinaroth: They could easily make some graphic that highlights suggested talents for LFD groups.

[5:13:22] dutchie76: Rob
[5:13:25] Biorrwolf: I'm having a better time with the current LFG/LFM tool in TBC. I've actually been talking to people and making connections
[5:13:29] Relynq: I'm confused, is that a Tauren Mage?
[5:13:29] tronbadgames: @Towelliee a lot easier to sell boosts if people arent happy with leveling
[5:13:30] sliproach: @mavericks312 i want my painting s back not fruit bowls and fishing in bear form
[5:13:31] dantezalive: i dont want it in tbc either
[5:13:32] dracullus: @Towelliee maybe that's the plan, if they give LFD from start there would be whines from andies, now they will shut up
[5:13:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: LFD in phase 2 could be alright
[5:13:40] hikaritd: @hikaritd but you have this already, I need something extra like AP/Titanforging lite
[5:13:47] Dakcart: They really need to make Rep and currency account wide!
[5:14:00] Zinaroth: I am not saying you should - it would be for the people who didn't know what to do but wants to perform decently.
[5:14:03] dutchie76: rare
[5:14:06] dewking93: will i be able to  rely on proffesion gear ? or is that not as good as mythic+ and raid gear?
[5:14:16] bagrain: sry you can't join party you don't have one of the top 3 speccs according to icy viens
[5:14:23] Lundrai: stomp!
[5:14:26] Biorrwolf: There's too much hand holding in retail as it is
[5:14:34] Daarksyde: that time anomaly comes in handy
[5:14:38] Biorrwolf: Give us modern visuals with Vanilla difficulty
[5:14:54] Nostoroth: rofl
[5:14:54] cellarrr: I was going to stomp, but then I took an arrow to the knee...
[5:14:54] Diamondead1: KEKW

[5:28:40] Zinaroth: @ZinarothMosberg It was a joke because he is a mage kiting mobs like all the boosters in Classic.
[5:28:48] dewking93: will evoker become avalible in retail in pre patch?

[5:44:06] udrogue: Anyone know if you can cancel that haste buff early to negate the haste loss?
[5:45:11] Rhonabu: @udrogue its prob coded to whenever the buff drops to activate the debuff but im sure if possible someone will find a way
[5:45:12] chickdrummer88: @beave_86 it will not be
[5:45:13] kashmara: so I won 60days game time from luxthos. I should probably save those for prepatch, yeah? Not much to do right now it seems
[5:45:23] magolivis: @udrogue just a thought but maybe stays for the duration like (u used the buff for 5, the debuff remains for 5) not sure anyway
[5:45:30] luckfore: MrDestructoid
[5:46:06] AwelessOne: @kashmara s4 looks fun if you want to try one of the most experimental seasons blizzard has ever created
[5:46:26] kashmara: true. would have a metric ton of catchup to do first

[5:48:38] angrywowplayer1337: shouldn’t Wrathion be kill on site since he’s the reason the burning legion invaded again and the planet got shanked? Like millions died lol. Everyone just seems chill with Wrathion though.
[5:48:49] luckfore: i dont understand why they didnt up the Zereth Mortis gear ilvl, its completely useless now
[5:49:14] Snabido: @angrywowplayer1337 I would like to refer you to Anduin punching Wrathion in 8.3 cinematic
[5:49:26] Reavios: how does ele and enhance shaman look?
[5:49:31] Dherjee: @luckfore how is it useless? new players can go to ZM and get enough gear for m0
[5:49:33] steldam: Longest pee EVAH!!!
[5:49:35] angrywowplayer1337: @snabido I don’t think a single dude punching him once equates lol.
[5:49:40] chickdrummer88: @luckfore like most places like ZM, it's just about transmog and pets/mounts
[5:49:41] AwelessOne: @Reavios in DF? they have arguably the best looking talent tree designed
[5:50:02] Shuttlelol: are you thinking alliance or horde for wotlk reroll?
[5:50:07] RagingPunk: towNod

[5:52:08] SlapaH03: did they change the human racial?
[5:52:26] hateful88: They said they were thinking about disabling racials in PvP for wrath Classic.
[5:52:30] Magickillz: no, you don't
[5:52:32] Mitune: I think they are removing that requirement
[5:52:33] procyon_mfc: No they said no requirement
[5:52:36] hateful88: All hope for alliance died with that
[5:52:39] enux337: nope dks for everyone
[5:52:41] gregl__: yes you do
[5:52:43] chickdrummer88: I'm hoping they just have the 50% buff last until DF. Seems stupid not to

[5:53:03] Mecabeast: maybe 1 55 on your account?
[5:53:09] gregl__: 100% REQUIRED ON FRESH SERVERS
[5:53:12] CanadianCataclysm: Anyone remember the old way they were going to do Deathknights? Where you had to have a level 60 pally and you had a questline to kill off that toon in order to make a DK
[5:53:16] gregl__: YES

[5:53:35] phinoxrgp: After that u need to have a lvl 55
[5:53:43] phinoxrgp: One dk
[5:53:59] cahoots82: People out here actually thinking they're just going to let you create a lvl 55 toon on a fresh server?
[5:54:01] Squirrel_nutty: same rules as back when it launched
[5:54:02] PracTlKaL: one dk per lvl 55??? huh
[5:54:03] phinoxrgp: If u make another one on another server u do need to have a lvl 55
[5:54:04] enux337: that would cause chaos on fresh severs lul dk boosters
[5:54:19] Mitune: They heard the feed back and to avoid anymore drama they deleted dragon riding 100% LUL

[6:12:39] GravityCat10989: omg towelliee i remember watching you like a decade ago is sub sunday still a thing?
[6:12:45] RiptoreCA: The 1100 temp testers they picked up in Feb for full time testing seems to have paid off big time
[6:12:59] luckfore: the dates for the Fated raids are in the calendar and last date is like 22 december

[6:13:29] aleksmetha: is there a item wat will fill up ur bags? like anima? ^^
[6:13:36] malgr0n: @Coriollis every games has its own development team, no worries here
[6:13:48] Ashes2AshesTV: yep
[6:13:49] luckfore: not the acquisition but was something diff
[6:13:52] RiptoreCA: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-07/activision-blizzard-makes-1-100-game-testers-full-time-employees#:~:text=Activision%20Blizzard%20Inc.%20said%20it,and%20their%20tenuous%20working%20conditions.
[6:13:57] cahoots82: Couldn't be. They don't do good things.
[6:13:58] Elseworldz: Oh yeah I remember that!
[6:14:03] RiptoreCA: link their
[6:14:14] Elseworldz: Yeah they did turn a bunch of testers full-time
[6:14:16] LeDerpski: "Activision Blizzard has announced that it will convert “all US-based temporary and contingent QA team members” to full-time employees. Nearly 1,100 workers will be made permanent as of July 1, and the minimum pay for those roles will increase to $20 per hour as of April 17."
[6:14:17] chickdrummer88: @riptoreca link no work
[6:14:21] Coriollis: @malgr0n like toweliee says we are kinda used to have Blizz teams underpowered and rush from team 2 to team 4 and so on so idk
[6:14:21] looney199725: blizzard is prob mass recruiting for there survival game there working on
[6:14:25] RiptoreCA: LOL
[6:14:26] Kale_Nd: https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/7/23015033/activision-blizzard-full-time-qa-game-tester-20-dollars-hourly
[6:14:28] Ashes2AshesTV: they actually did, I am sure as part of the "we are good people, please approve the acquisition"
[6:14:29] bawheid: has the dragonflight release date been announced?
[6:14:30] RiptoreCA: It works on copy paste
[6:14:51] BigJustin26: so how's Moogic doin?
[6:14:59] Reckless_Monk: think everyone was malding about the prices of the expansion
[6:15:01] RiptoreCA: They were ramping up for DF at the time I am sure.
[6:15:02] ItsGlime: 4
[6:15:03] looney199725: there not all for working on wow
[6:15:04] tebbix: why nobody talked about this
[6:15:04] shaxxtv: all?
[6:15:04] Lostdogal: didn't help the pally or mage trees lol, get another couple thousand testers in there
[6:15:08] PigPenLen: @looney199725 towNod
[6:15:09] looney199725: blizzard has a new survival game in the works
[6:15:11] looney199725: they got ppl for that
[6:15:17] cahoots82: 1100 people to ensure thier diablo immortal mtx are working
[6:15:23] RiptoreCA: Well, based on what games they have working, it's assumed a large portion of it.
[6:15:24] malgr0n: @Coriollis yeah, you're right, nobody knows for sure. so, let's try to enjoy the ride :D
[6:15:29] TialePetit: Its only that they will convert in the company.. not just for WoW testing
[6:15:32] Reckless_Monk: @bawheid before the end of 2022
[6:15:41] looney199725: well the 5 mans are alot cleaner than normal alphas
[6:15:50] looney199725: sl necrotic wake was a shit show in alpha
[6:15:54] turaw_kemor: anyone know what the lvl 70 boost gives with wrath?
[6:15:56] Bleedorang3: @looney199725 I've heard great things about their adventure/survival game too
[6:15:59] steward93: getting a bit bored of tbc, would now be a good time to return to retail?
[6:16:05] Savagee320: @towelliee since you tested every tank spec available atm. What would be your ranking for them?
[6:16:11] bawheid: @reckless_monk is that a fingers crossed date?
[6:16:12] SpoofAvatar: and the systems
[6:16:15] looney199725: na there 5 mans have had issues
[6:16:18] mrkenndy: @steward93 tomorrow season 4 starts
[6:16:21] looney199725: tol dagor in bfa didnt ever get fixed
[6:16:22] Coriollis: except the studio they bauight a month ago for future xpacks I never heard Blizz taking massive emplyees
[6:16:24] kingjudethe1st: Think there will be a new build this week?
[6:16:25] TialePetit: ANd they didn't convert 1100 in Feb... since the article says that it will be 1100 total... dated April. 500 was in Dec.
[6:16:29] looney199725: alot of sl 5 mans have bugs never got fixed
[6:16:33] Bernardo994: i cant say im kinda excited they are listening
[6:16:38] mrkenndy: @steward93 in 6 weeks? wotlk classic starts
[6:16:49] cahoots82: @bawheid They're selling pre-orders stating the game will be out before the end of 2022
[6:16:57] tebbix: Tow do you think they will revert back the speed of the soar?
[6:17:02] aleksmetha: WARRIOR PLSS
[6:17:09] Bernardo994: did you see Asmon loose his shit over dragon riding not happening in the old kingdoms
[6:17:13] looney199725: i hope the game is out around 22 nov so raid is over before christmas
[6:17:17] Bernardo994: he got pissed
[6:17:19] moppnitz: wow what? when do we get to see the main city?
[6:17:31] cahoots82: Asmo has to make content. When is he not pissed about something?
[6:17:35] Bernardo994: well drathere
[6:17:37] Bleedorang3: @bernardo994 oh no
[6:17:40] Bernardo994: drakthere
[6:17:54] Bernardo994: its funny

[6:18:03] bawheid: @cahoots82 when i heard pre patch in 3 months i thought blizz had given a fixed date
[6:18:07] looney199725: my god towls there reason was for the pet battlers hello didnt you read it?
[6:18:14] JiberishUI: Moogic
[6:18:16] JiberishUI: hahaha
[6:18:17] Savagedave: is your room normally this dark?
[6:18:18] ItsGlime: wtb the priest updates tomorrow =/
[6:18:20] Bernardo994: @cahoots82 also true
[6:18:21] Coriollis: they are thinking now if they should cave in to social media or not , not if that was fun or not to do which is kinda sad
[6:18:24] zenkodac: i think the video asmon made reacting to the flying change is exactlly the wordt type of reaction, not because he's wrong but just how vitriolic he is
[6:18:33] flebbooo: But Towelliee Dracthyr can get to pet battles faster BabyRage
[6:18:35] cahoots82: @bawheid Gotcha. There's no fixed date yet. Just before the end of 2022.
[6:18:39] Bleedorang3: the real reason is they don't want to invalidate every flying mount in WoW history
[6:18:41] SpoofAvatar: they will limit it in PVP zones and revert it elsewhere
[6:18:41] zenkodac: worst*
[6:18:43] looney199725: asmon is over reacting
[6:18:54] tebbix: KEKW
[6:18:56] Bernardo994: lol
[6:18:57] looney199725: asmon is actually making stupid comments lately
[6:19:00] RiptoreCA: When I worked at Nintendo for a short stint they had at largest a testing department US of 350 people. And that was like 10 projects. MMO testing is different but I imagine they don't have much more a couple projects going. So 1100 people split between lets say 5 projects. That's still huge
[6:19:07] UltraKSlaya: I guess it will be easier to go betweeen instances to farm
[6:19:09] Bernardo994: ur right but he was so mad
[6:19:09] Mattsta: i'm surprised they don't turn soar off in the old world until they maybe release dragonriding for the old world too
[6:19:10] Snabido: Stroking one out? 😏
[6:19:14] doomkry: just nerf it if you have warmode on
[6:19:16] zenkodac: like instead of calmly just saying they should chnage it he goes into a "they are killing wow" rant
[6:19:17] Bernardo994: funny
[6:19:27] Kale_Nd: i don't understand why in their reason they included chromie time. Do dracthyr even get access to chromie time since they start at 68 and leave the zone at 70 ?
[6:19:56] rensdeamo: Finished eating ?
[6:19:57] cahoots82: I feel like Asmon's base is full of people who begrudgingly still play WoW so he plays up to those people by overreacting to stuff. I thought his dragonriding thing was a joke...
[6:20:07] LeDerpski: You cant soar in combat anyways
[6:20:07] Diamondtaire: I hate that Asmongold is treated like his opinion is absolute. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about half the time
[6:20:16] zgag: It's a *fun* issue.  Blizzard is doing what they do best.  Nerf fun from the game
[6:20:17] futomara01: its all about them battlepets
[6:20:18] cahoots82: @Kale_Nd You can go back and do Chromie time at any level
[6:20:28] Coriollis: @cahoots82 okay so u feel Blizz reasoning was right ?
[6:20:32] SymphonyOnIce: yo @Towelliee  you try blood dk's yet? whats your opinion on it? thinking of looking at playing one possibly
[6:20:37] Funderik: if it was the nerf minus the bluepost i don't think it would look as bad, however the change isn't a big deal either way. it just gave the angry mob fuel.
[6:20:40] zenkodac: i think if everyone just said blizz should change it back instead of going into insta dooming clickbait mode calling devs morons tgat want to kill the game they would change it much faster
[6:20:41] akaari5486: Soar should not be nerfed,period.My opinion
[6:20:53] zenkodac: that*
[6:21:07] brian_777777777: I think that how fast it was was good. making it slower is making it worse
[6:21:09] zgag: I was hoping not to see something like that from the Alpha. The feedback was very very positive with dragon riding( soaring)
[6:21:09] YinYangMan77: @cahoots82 No, they don't.  Just an opportunity to take shots at Asmon.
[6:21:15] cahoots82: @Coriollis I feel like addressing an ability that lets one class/race move at over twice the speed of any other race is a bit much, yes... but there are probably better solutions. Their given reasons were ass though.
[6:21:18] Funderik: people looking at alpha like it's going to be the end product. just like they do with datamining, things always change.
[6:21:27] Bernardo994: @popikaify agree its new and should impact the world in a new way
[6:21:29] zgag: Blizzard choosing to ignore the majority again
[6:21:30] zenkodac: i dont think no one is arguing they should change it
[6:21:32] dracullus: Ion nerfed soar cause community started geting too chummy
[6:21:50] Dankind64: the 1Heads
[6:21:55] zenkodac: mostly people are trying to concive of a reason just to try and understand
[6:22:00] zgag: @dracullus Right.  Ion reverted back to his old self
[6:22:13] Snabido: Well, yeah, according to your warcraftlogs Evoker will be the go-to dps class for DF 😏
[6:22:14] Lostdogal: One of the few times the entire community is universally in favour of something and they change it.
[6:22:18] flebbooo: Yeah cause right now, their thought process is literal garbage on the dragonriding thing
[6:22:18] zgag: "The team decided that X was to good" so we did
[6:22:20] Bleedorang3: You don't think Dragonriding/Soar being 2x the speed of Flying Mounts doesn't just straight up invalidate every other flying mount in the game
[6:22:26] looney199725: why are you caring about log
[6:22:29] YinYangMan77: They gave piss-poor reasoning.
[6:22:31] c0mmander_starscream: Ion's gotta get off his hookers and blow binges
[6:22:32] looney199725: when there isnt lvl 70 gameplay
[6:22:33] Bleedorang3: @zgag the majority is quite frequently wrong
[6:22:33] User3600: wtf Cow magician
[6:22:35] Funderik: for all we know soar at that speed, causes issues with old world stuff, in terms of engine.
[6:22:38] brian_777777777: like if they nerfed the hoverbike in gta that would be a bad move
[6:22:45] megalomanisk2: I mean, it's fine to change things during alpha but the changes should make the content MORE fun not LESS fun, and lowering the max speed of soaring makes it LESS fun which obviously causes an outrage
[6:22:51] Bleedorang3: @zgag just because you share a popular opinion doesn't mean you're right
[6:22:57] Coriollis: @cahoots82 we had racial imbalance since WoW started it doesn't make any sense regarding the explanation we got , not saying u have to like Asmon or something
[6:22:59] looney199725: im actually worried if anyone is looking at alpha rn without lvl 70 gameplay and thinksstuff is broken and undertuned
[6:23:04] zgag: @Bleedorang3 Soaring is a 5 min cd.  it's not the same dude
[6:23:04] Bleedorang3: popular = correct is a brain disease
[6:23:05] vic_ave: @Towelliee it only took to end of expansion but you got your BoA Sandworn relics
[6:23:18] Jardon00: Blizzard did their typical "we're gonna add this stuff account wide" when it's far too late to even matter
[6:23:27] Bernardo994: account wide stuff would make it easier to play alts.  which i would like to do one day
[6:23:43] looney199725: i dont rly see it as a big deal
[6:23:45] Allsee_: Why isnt protoform synth account wide
[6:23:47] Joneeeez: its kinda cool to see every zone etc before the launch, gives us the player a good perception about how the expansion is going to be
[6:23:49] YinYangMan77: Seriously... I shouldn't be working on my 4th alt progressing through Zereth M, doing all of the same quests, with all of the same grind...
[6:23:52] Bleedorang3: @megalomanisk2 then why have you not been screaming for a buff, why is 950% "the right amount"?
[6:23:55] brian_777777777: oh true it is just evoker problems who really cares
[6:23:57] Bleedorang3: why not 10000%
[6:23:58] cahoots82: @Coriollis Soar's speed is 950%. Highest mount speed is 410%. That's completely ridiculous that it's limited to one class/race outside of dragon isles...
[6:24:04] Bleedorang3: why not 20000%
[6:24:07] Bernardo994: @twiztidhatchet lol
[6:24:08] Diamondtaire: RagnarokRoseV subscribed at Tier 1. 
[6:24:12] Archrade: @Towelliee I bet none would realize this nerf if it was not written anywhere
[6:24:16] llNoTToXiCll: make it 720% and its perfect
[6:24:23] NecroTarkan: you have the general populace that has not experienced it. SO once it gets to live they wouldn't know the difference.
[6:24:25] zgag: They should now nerf or get rid of mage portals. They can get to places faster than anyone
[6:24:28] Kale_Nd: I really don't care they they nerfed the speed. What i can't stand is the half-assed reason they used
[6:24:31] net_mi: Ppl just want to complain, because hey, it's "cool" to make blizz look bad
[6:24:31] nokster: @cahoots82  but that doesnt affect you 1 bit.
[6:24:33] Jardon00: I keep hoping they'll learn with the stuff that should be account wide from day one, but they won't
[6:24:35] YinYangMan77: Reps need to be account wide...yesterday.
[6:24:42] LeDerpski: @Bleedorang3 Its the nerf without reason thats the issue not the speed itself
[6:24:42] megalomanisk2: @Bleedorang3 Maybe even faster would make it even more fun, it's hard to know without getting to test it
[6:24:45] Allsee_: @Frighten76 And seperate the community more with out cross faction guilds?
[6:24:46] zgag: They should nerf anything that my class can't do
[6:24:52] Joneeeez: honestly everything Ive seen so far in Dragonflight looks great, all the gamesystems etc
[6:24:53] DeanoTV: reps are gonna be account wide in DF
[6:24:56] omnifreakfx: @Frighten76 yeah me too. Been saying for a few years now. I thought it'd be cool of Sylvanas took the undead and started a 3rd faction that way.
[6:25:04] Bernardo994: hot ice
[6:25:05] bierarnoo: I dont care about the speed. Just play the game and enjoy it:)
[6:25:20] ditaern: @net_mi Or people just like going fast.
[6:25:23] Bernardo994: @BierArnO truth
[6:25:24] Coriollis: @cahoots82 so limit it to Dragon Isles only ? like u could say gaining 10% reputation is ludacris, or 25% stun resist in pvp is ludacris and so many more examples
[6:25:28] llNoTToXiCll: THATS huge to be honest
[6:25:37] zgag: @Towelliee Asmongold put out a video on the soar nerf
[6:25:44] looney199725: yes
[6:25:46] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee all reps are going account wide or just df ones ?
[6:25:48] Bernardo994: yea
[6:25:54] Bleedorang3: @lederpski oh no! now they'll only be able to *checks notes* STILL go way faster than every flying mount in the game
[6:25:54] looney199725: and asmon over reacted
[6:25:56] zgag: Max discussed some of it too
[6:25:57] Bernardo994: hes lost his shit
[6:26:01] cahoots82: @Coriollis Sure. I'm just saying it's current iteration probably needed addressed. I don't have the solution nor do I think what they've changed so far is it.
[6:26:16] looney199725: its still 610% speed
[6:26:17] looney199725: who cares
[6:26:19] looney199725: its fast
[6:26:20] wastedxtime93: @looney199725 Asmon over react? Never???
[6:26:21] carloscgc: that sounds terrible and really grinding
[6:26:24] Bleedorang3: @bernardo994 oh no!
[6:26:27] Kasvot_Vaxt: renown is a better system than rep as long as they dont time gate it
[6:26:31] mefruk7: anything on DF WQ system? BFA alike or SL alike?
[6:26:35] Bleedorang3: some random dude on the internet LOST HIS SHIT
[6:26:48] Bleedorang3: I now SHARE THAT OPINION IMPLICITLY
[6:26:52] Bernardo994: @Bleedorang3 yea yea know
[6:26:55] zgag: @looney199725 I do think he overreacts at times but he is right with this. It's a pattern that we DIDN"T want to see.
[6:27:01] Kasvot_Vaxt: i mean timegated in the same way as SL where they drip feed it to you
[6:27:08] Bernardo994: still funny to see and walk away
[6:27:09] looney199725: plz
[6:27:09] Odinslayer: @looney199725 its 220% nerf why people are okay with it? i dont get it.. its not about 610 its still fast its about why in first place they nerf it, and the excuse they gave is just so bad
[6:27:19] wastedxtime93: @looney199725 That clown called me a retard yesterday cause he was bitching about trash in raids, etc and I said to stop playing and to go get carried in raids in FF and LoA like normal lmao
[6:27:23] looney199725: why do you care about the nerf?
[6:27:36] Coriollis: @cahoots82 I mean thee cat is out of the bag so instead of looking like fun police since the reasoning was juvenile at best. Not trying to impose a pov on you just sayin is just illogical
[6:27:42] zgag: @looney199725 Check out the Alpha forums discussing it and it's not a very popular decision
[6:27:46] boomerang101: renown is  a form of time gating
[6:27:49] looney199725: ye
[6:27:53] zgag: it's *
[6:27:54] looney199725: because ppl want to complain
[6:27:55] Jardon00: maybe they'll actually make gear from vendors useful.....nah they won't
[6:28:02] looney199725: blizz could do everything right ppl will complain
[6:28:02] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[6:28:05] magemaster225: they wont make the gear account wide
[6:28:12] cahoots82: @Coriollis It's alpha. Perhaps they never ever intended it to be 950%.
[6:28:18] net_mi: Wow players need to relax, it's not a nerf if the thing was overtuned
[6:28:22] Funderik: do we have to care tho, it's still fast.
[6:28:22] zgag: That was the issue with SL testing. Blizzard just didn't listen to the overall/majority feedback
[6:28:27] Odinslayer: @looney199725 can you pull out blizzard's dick out of y our mouth and see the reason? or you just want to talk lol
[6:28:28] SpoofAvatar: seemed to fast to begin with IMHO
[6:28:29] Nerdshockz: ppl just lose their shit cuz they dont have bigger problems to complain about cuz DF looks sick tbh and very few things beside unfinished talent tress to complain
[6:28:32] pavepawns: i dont mind the speed nerf if they reduce the cd on using the flying form

[6:28:32] ditaern: @looney199725 But it was faster. It's like getting a cookie, but then 1/3 of it taken away. Sure you still have 2/3 of a cookie, but you had a whole cookie before.
[6:28:39] YinYangMan77: Otherwise, it just looks like Blizz reverting to its former self...
[6:28:41] Lasidor: "Because" wasnta  reason when your Parents whooped dat azz, its not a good reason for game decisiosn either lol @Towelliee
[6:28:42] looney199725: @Odinslayer i shit on blizz for alot of stuff
[6:28:44] botscast: KEKW
[6:28:47] Mecabeast: !clip
[6:28:47] Jardon00: @zgag you mean with every alpha/beta, that's the problem lol
[6:28:48] Jack_the_Dipper: I wanted that waaaaay!
[6:28:48] aleksmetha: maybe boting?
[6:28:51] mrrazputin: There is a blue post telling why they are nerfing it by 30%. and its due to pet battles ...
[6:28:56] looney199725: but crying about something that isnt boosting your class ability isnt a big deal
[6:28:59] Coriollis: @cahoots82 anyway I hope they sort it put which beneffits them and the community :)
[6:28:59] GabCast81: KEKW
[6:28:59] laughing_octopus: thats what they did to paladins
[6:29:00] Funderik: it's was insane fast from the start, if we flip it was it was 600% from teh start, no one would be crying for a buff to 900%
[6:29:03] looney199725: it only works in open world
[6:29:04] looney199725: who cares
[6:29:11] boomerang101: why not just attach all the renown stuff to rep and just get rid of it all
[6:29:12] CaseysOn: it was too fast causing players to get sick
[6:29:14] Nerdshockz: you cant really compare that tbf
[6:29:14] ItsGlime: not comparable...
[6:29:17] Sepulchair: They should know they will immediately appear as more professional if they give us an explaination for things..
[6:29:19] cahoots82: That's not a fair comparison imo
[6:29:24] darthturtle1031: We nerfed your class because pet battles
[6:29:25] bloowaterr: not comparable bro could just be a number crunch
[6:29:32] kreff_: oh like they did ferals?
[6:29:33] Toxarina: towCopium
[6:29:35] bloowaterr: a number crunch is not a big deal
[6:29:38] LeDerpski: @CaseysOn Then they can add a screen effect toggle
[6:29:39] onybear: People have to remember this is alpha…nothing is permanent and set in stone…they are still working on it.  By no means does that mean people can’t have a say, but having a meltdown everytime something changes.
[6:29:44] zgag: @looney199725 It's not just about the ability, but more about how the community feels.  Blizzard stated that they were going to listen more to the community this go around
[6:29:45] Toxarina: shit love the new emotes @towelliee
[6:29:51] YinYangMan77: True
[6:29:55] Toxarina: towHeart towNotwo towNo towCrylaugh towLets towGo
[6:29:57] looney199725: guess what
[6:29:59] flebbooo: I'm neutral on the speed change, i'm just really not happy about the change to non dragon isles zones...
[6:30:05] cahoots82: Here's how it goes. People bitch about soaring being nerfed. It goes live @ 950% then they bitch they're other toons can't do it outside of dragon isle.
[6:30:05] looney199725: if they listened to everything community wants wow will be shit
[6:30:08] mrkenndy: @Towelliee they might not know the feel BUT they know the number change
[6:30:13] Jardon00: @zgag they have said that every single alpha/beta for years now and have yet to do it.  not surprised here at all
[6:30:14] Thoreya: soar thing is the first thing in DF that the community can fully rage about bc everything else has been going well
[6:30:17] TheItalianStallion321: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[6:30:17] Odinslayer: @looney199725 yea it only works in open world and their reason for the nerf is (pet battels/TRANSOMG RUNS) are they for real? lol its a 5 min cd racial and the only racial in 19 years that is fun and they had to fuck it up for no reason at all
[6:30:21] Thoreya: people just outraged to be outraged
[6:30:27] thenormalbeast: They nerf it because everyone who wants to farm mats on open world will need to create an evoker alt for faster movement
[6:30:29] Coriollis: we just saw Max tweeting fun cool stuff with soar speed thats all :)
[6:30:30] soundpraenk: well asmon says it's bad and ppl automatically say it's bad even they didn't have a chance to test it
[6:30:39] YinYangMan77: Devil's in the details.
[6:30:40] Toxarina: oh God asmon
[6:30:45] Strayer_J: they should say why they make cahnges for production builds.. i dont think they really need to explain things that they change that arent even released? @Towelliee
[6:30:50] Twigz_KC: Twigz_KC subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[6:30:51] pavepawns: @Funderik thats abit different cause at this point ppl are/have been using dragonriding so they are used to the 900 more now. so that 600% nerf is noticeable. the comparison would be more if dragonriding AND soaring was 600% to 900% cause then there would be a difference to what we know so far
[6:30:52] zgag: @Jardon00 They seemed to show some hints they were, but this here is showing the opposite
[6:30:55] Archrade: @Towelliee I bet none would realize speed nerf if it was not written anywhere. At least 70% wouldn't realize it on first day.
[6:30:57] Odinslayer: @thenormalbeast its 5 fucking mins dude how is that even good for gathering mats?
[6:30:58] Bleedorang3: 950% is the gods %
[6:31:00] Toxarina: towGift towGift towGift towGift
[6:31:03] thenormalbeast: Draw distance loading speed?
[6:31:06] looney199725: @Odinslayer i dont care its nerfed its not a big deal so complaining about it seems pointless isnt like they deleted your class
[6:31:07] yepclocc: the reasoning behind the soar nerf is fucking garbage thats why people are mad
[6:31:07] Bleedorang3: I demand 10000% speed
[6:31:10] iasu_: they gotta work on everything.
[6:31:11] Thoreya: is 30% really that noticable?
[6:31:11] cahoots82: Does the reason matter? It's not like it's going to be good enough regardless of what they say.
[6:31:13] Thoreya: lol
[6:31:16] c0mmander_starscream: Game Over Man
[6:31:18] aleksmetha: mybe boting?
[6:31:19] Sollice: WoW has ALWAYS had a problem with DC on fast moving things
[6:31:24] growent: yo, anyone have the link for the roadmap of the DF alpha? i cant remember how many phases are
[6:31:26] Sollice: DC still with fel rush and heroic leap
[6:31:30] looney199725: people care more about soar nerf than the class trees lately
[6:31:44] flebbooo: @looney199725 Bro could u suck blizz dick any harder? holy shit
[6:31:46] Coriollis: yeah mages teleport should be nerfed too Kappa , meanwhile DH fel rush DESPAIR
[6:31:47] vic_ave: DH still DC with Fel rush
[6:31:48] cahoots82: @Thoreya It's a 30% total nerf. From 950 to 633 or something
[6:31:49] Nerdshockz: btw @Towelliee  you hyped for tomorrows new build?
[6:31:50] wastedxtime93: @Thoreya When it's 30% of 900ish, yes.
[6:31:53] Odinslayer: @looney199725 its not about the nerf, the complain is not about the 240% nerf its about the reasoning they gave, and there's no reason for it to be nerfed... they saw people having fun with it and they said fuck that we aint doing it
[6:31:56] Bleedorang3: Max got tons of frame hitching using Soar in EK
[6:31:57] Strayer_J: you cant nerf something that doesnt exist yet
[6:31:58] Thoreya: @looney199725 bc its the only thing they can be outraged about since theyve been good with the trees
[6:31:59] net_mi: They don't really owe us an explanation, it's their game, and they do what they think is best for the game.
[6:32:00] Sollice: And it is suspicious @Towelliee that they nerfed it after last week release with races happening and DCs. It does sound like a technical issue
[6:32:13] Bleedorang3: @odinslayer what if there is a reason for it
[6:32:18] looney199725: @flebbomate i just said i shit on wow 24/7 so pipe down your internet clown your mad over something so minor
[6:32:19] zgag: @looney199725 Nah, there are plenty of feedback posts on the forums. I'm guessing you live in your own bubble and haven't check it out
[6:32:19] Bleedorang3: and you're just not seeing it
[6:32:25] Sollice: @net_mi EHHHH. Sure they can. But you have to make a game that people want if your sub based
[6:32:33] Bleedorang3: will you write a public apology for your babyrage?
[6:32:34] looney199725: soar is a minor problem compared to trees
[6:32:42] pavepawns: @Sollice yea i think so too. id rather they just say that instead (even if that isnt the case) cause that seems far more a valid reason then the pet battle reason stuff
[6:32:43] luckfore: the reasons they gave just dont make sense, they are proven false
[6:32:50] Odinslayer: @Bleedorang3 pet battles and transmog runs? that's their reasons lol
[6:33:00] looney199725: id rather them focus on trees than soar going from 950 to 610
[6:33:11] Bleedorang3: @odinslayer what about technical issues?
[6:33:13] Sollice: @Sollice Of course! That is what an Alpha is for! We tried it and the game at this time can not handle it. Open and honest if thats the truth
[6:33:14] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  mount hyjal
[6:33:16] Kisswani: Hyjal ?
[6:33:18] magemaster225: just disable the anti cheat nad demon hunters will never get dc'd again as a bonus
[6:33:20] zgag: @looney199725 If it's minor why did Blizzard move to nerf it?
[6:33:22] Bleedorang3: have you not watched ANY alpha content?
[6:33:23] Coriollis: the tree from Firelands
[6:33:24] cahoots82: 50?
[6:33:24] wastedxtime93: Max made it from the sword to Org lol
[6:33:26] onybear: Dalaran
[6:33:30] cahoots82: Wait till Asmon hosts a soar race
[6:33:34] Bleedorang3: @zgag are you listening?
[6:33:34] cahoots82: and 1000s show upp
[6:33:42] fluffk1n: uldum and the flying raids
[6:33:43] Odinslayer: @Bleedorang3 they didnt say shit about tech issues in that blue post.. if they want to be honest they need to put that shit in it.. not pet battels and trans runs dude did you even read the blue post about it?
[6:33:46] Archrade: I think view distance is problem when moving such fast. Engine does not let load so much enviroment so fast.
[6:33:49] kashmara: or the raid up in the clouds
[6:33:53] kashmara: from cata
[6:34:10] looney199725: @zgag they dont know themselves but its a minor change that isnt effecting how you preform in the game
[6:34:16] Bleedorang3: @odinslayer bruh USE YOUR BRAIN. Think independently
[6:34:18] cahoots82: @Odinslayer Would a better reason make you feel any better about it or are you just determined to be upset about it?
[6:34:21] yepclocc: @Bleedorang3 they should give a good reason for the nerf not mog farming and pet battles lmfao. thats why people are bad, because the reason they put out is stupid and makes no sense
[6:34:27] looney199725: people who legit say soar nerf is a big deal need to get there head checked im sorry
[6:34:30] yepclocc: mad*
[6:34:32] Funderik: i think it's an engine thing and they don't want to admit the engine is out dated, which is fine, work on the engine next.
[6:34:32] felektralock: why the warlock talent isnt up yet :(
[6:34:32] StraightErro: Terrace of Storms in Storm Peaks, tallest Fing structure on Northrend
[6:34:39] Bleedorang3: y'all care SO MUCH about 2 lines in one post
[6:34:40] Mecabeast: also sharding is probably an issue for zones
[6:34:48] Bleedorang3: it's insane how mad this makes you ppl
[6:34:51] Lasidor: The Alakir platform lol
[6:35:03] Odinslayer: @cahoots82 if they said hey, our 20 year old engine doesn't handle this shit so we had to nerf it abit so people dont crash the game iw ould be okay thats a good reason, but pet battels and fucking trans runs? are they kidding? lol
[6:35:04] wastedxtime93: Have they said was P4 is gonna consist of yet?
[6:35:06] magemaster225: then people would complain that blizzard doesnt spend there multi dollars on updated servers to handle it
[6:35:23] Snabido: @Bleedorang3 DansGame
[6:35:25] Odinslayer: @Bleedorang3 i dont need to use my brain for something that stupid to realize that nerf is uncalled for and its stupid
[6:35:35] Crowargus: oof see sloots sunburn towelliee lol this is why gamers dont go outside lol
[6:35:36] Bleedorang3: @odinslayer babyrage
[6:35:44] pavepawns: next dungeon is the gnoll one
[6:35:46] Coriollis: @magemaster225 we know when 40 man enter Org thats happening like no need to know xd
[6:35:51] yepclocc: @Bleedorang3 soar as is was universally praised and fun. why make it LESS fun? whats the point?
[6:35:52] wastedxtime93: Raid testing starts tomorrow, heard it here first folks.
[6:35:54] looney199725: honestly the people complaining the most i feel like are the rp ppl who touch eachother in goldshire at this point
[6:35:55] Sollice: @looney199725 I don't know if it's so much about the speed nerf and more about the honesty of it. I think with DF they have been much better than about SL and people are now expecting that. So the first time they do something the players dont want people are going to freak about it. "Back to SL testing where devs didnt listen to us"
[6:35:56] thebakeriscomingforu: seems a little early to raid test though
[6:35:58] zgag: @looney199725 You do realize that Blizzard mentioned Chromie time is one of the reasons yet it can't be used for Chromie time.  It shows just how sometimes Blizzard is disconnected from their own game
[6:36:02] Mattsta: raid testing tomorrow confirmed PogChamp
[6:36:06] agentblaster123: Could you rate all the tank spec that are available in alpha currently from worst to best ?
[6:36:06] cahoots82: @Odinslayer They're given reasoning is shit. Agreed. So be upset about them not being upfront. Maybe phrase the source of your anger better than "they nerfed soar" cause that sounds like babyrage
[6:36:07] Bleedorang3: @yepclocc what if it's still fun as hell
[6:36:23] yepclocc: @Bleedorang3 its LESS fun. 30% less fun
[6:36:27] pavepawns: the halls and gnoll dungeon next
[6:36:41] ditaern: @looney199725 Good to know there are still players like you who will ridicule people for what they enjoy in a game.
[6:36:43] looney199725: @Sollice so you see my point people are over reacting
[6:36:44] Odinslayer: @Bleedorang3 literally yes men like you what made shadowlands fail, seeing people complain about covenants and saying that shit you just said failed a whole expansion..
[6:36:58] Bleedorang3: @yepclocc then why not buff it to 2000%? Why haven't you been babyraging for buffs this entire time?
[6:36:59] Crowargus: na raid testing wont be til beta when most of the top raiding guilds in beta
[6:37:00] net_mi: You mean giving haters more excuses to complain even more about wow? "Game can't handle lightspeed movement? Wow sucks, wow is dead - Baldy 2022" LUL
[6:37:08] Bleedorang3: why is 950% the perfect speed
[6:37:17] atowellthatiallreadyused: The new andor trailer is so insaley good like 99% of ppl watching it are praising the trailer
[6:37:22] Sollice: @looney199725 Of course. And truthfully the ONLY people who can complain are ones in the Alpha because those are the ones who have experienced it. 99% of the people complaining about it have no idea how it feels at all
[6:37:25] Bleedorang3: if faster = more fun where has all the babyrage for buffs been?
[6:37:29] PigPenLen: @Bleedorang3 but 70% still fun...
[6:37:35] Rikksmoon94: hey guys, is he levelling up this char or did they cap the max lvl after legion?
[6:37:36] zgag: @looney199725 Blizzard will do these random nerfs and give a half ass explanation to why they did it.  Yes, it's an ability, but I think most of the people are wondering why( It doesn't bold well for DF if this will be a common thing)
[6:37:40] looney199725: its getting old hearing people cry about soar when theres more important systems that need to be addressed like trees
[6:37:44] delaine: delaine subscribed with Prime. 
[6:37:44] delaine: delaine subscribed with Prime. 
[6:37:49] ItsGlime: lol
[6:37:49] Toxarina: lols
[6:37:54] net_mi: lol
[6:37:55] Odinslayer: @cahoots82 am not mad about the nerf, am mad about that stupid post they did it shows how bad they think and how its for real they dont play the game, how a 5 min cd racial would fuck the WHOLE HEALTH OF THE GAME ? i dont fucking get it
[6:37:55] looney199725: they nerfed soar
[6:37:58] looney199725: its not a big deal

[6:38:13] yepclocc: @Bleedorang3 the way it is its perfect. everyone liked it. why the fuck would they touch it and give a bullshit ass reason for it too? dont you see how this isnt making any sense?
[6:38:15] Bleedorang3: I would hate to be a game dev in 2022
[6:38:16] Angsterz: the reason they gave is so lame , pet battles efficiency I mean cmon
[6:38:18] net_mi: no amount of explanation is gonna make you happy
[6:38:19] ItsGlime: just remove it, really piss these idiots off =]
[6:38:34] atowellthatiallreadyused: Towelliee the new star wars andor trailer geting pretty much praised on every platform
[6:38:45] Dankind64: LUL
[6:38:45] flebbooo: KEKW
[6:38:46] Odinslayer: transmog runs and you cant even use soar in raids @Towelliee
[6:38:46] Sollice: @schizotwitchen Looks good. Looking forward to it
[6:38:47] Coriollis: unless they have planned literaly open world zones like Wintergrasp sort of I don't see the problem , like unless something like that
[6:38:52] thebakeriscomingforu: I think the whole health of the game depends on if DF is the new foundation for Wow moving forward or if a lot of DF is ditched with the next xpac?
[6:38:53] Toxarina: how many convos we gonna have about pet battles
[6:38:56] Nakastrio: Is there somewhere to see a roadmap of what's released each "phase"?
[6:38:57] flebbooo: such a bad reasoning LUL
[6:39:05] TheBroCrow: Sorry man, can't come to raid, gotta full clear all these eastern kingdoms pet battles
[6:39:12] Bleedorang3: the amount of petulant babyrage you have to deal with is rage-inducing
[6:39:25] net_mi: I hope they remove it altogether in old zones
[6:39:43] Joneeeez: new alpha build tomorrow im hyped, these zones looks so cool compared to shadowlands
[6:39:46] Odinslayer: @Bleedorang3 you're just trolling, please tell me you're a troll so i dont take you seriously cause by now you sound so fucking dumb lol
[6:39:52] Angsterz: @net_mi why not add dragonriding to everyone before killing fun?
[6:39:55] yepclocc: OH WOW JIMMY IS GONNA BE 3 MIN FASTER TO ICC DOING HIS 34587th INVINCIBLE RUN, BETTER NERF IT come on
[6:40:01] killswiitch: They just want you to not be able to do things so quickly so you’ll stay subbed longer.
[6:40:05] Mattsta: well like for farming old mogs to sell...being able to get from raid to raid/dungeon to dungeon in like 1/3rd the time would def help your gold/hr
[6:40:06] Lostdogal: @Bleedorang3 dude write baby rage some more
[6:40:07] Bleedorang3: @odinslayer babryage
[6:40:09] killswiitch: towSip
[6:40:26] tebbix: we would be so happy lol
[6:40:27] Sollice: Alright. You all can discuss things without being toxic to eachother
[6:40:31] Sollice: You have been warned.....
[6:40:40] Kasvot_Vaxt: pandoras box
[6:40:43] nesman27: anchoring
[6:40:47] Bleedorang3: That's what I'm saying. Why is 950% suddenly "the perfect speed"
[6:40:49] zgag: I think it's a good thing. Blizzard should be reading the comments from streams too.  It's a great tool to show what the community thinks
[6:40:54] looney199725: soar change in grand scheme is minor compared to trees and tuning of end game content
[6:41:04] ditaern: @Sollice That left the door hours ago
[6:41:07] LearnedSomething: it's called anchoring
[6:41:08] bukka_hot: its not because of the knowldge its because of their logic/ intentions
[6:41:09] Wolfenhoof: Imagine we would have the release and the Dragonriding would just suck from the start. We would have never know that i was once fun Kappa
[6:41:16] Joneeeez: @zgag I dont believe they do that, maybe sometimes but its rarely happens I guess
[6:41:20] zysmos: i mean the faster you go the funnier it is
[6:41:22] PokerFaceMoose: that's an argument to make alpha more closed
[6:41:27] Dankind64: free alpha?! POGGERS
[6:41:28] tebbix: Pog
[6:41:29] luckfore: POGGERS ?
[6:41:29] zysmos: as simple as that
[6:41:30] vic_ave: Towellie has alpha keys
[6:41:35] PvtHudson093: you have keys?
[6:41:37] Bleedorang3: Careful Odin may quit the game if Dragonriding launches at 610%
[6:41:38] TheBroCrow: ALPHA? POGGERS
[6:41:38] Wolfenhoof: Towel has keys confirmed, Panda was right !
[6:41:40] StraightErro: Ignorance is bliss.... we would have been better off not knowing
[6:41:41] kashmara: That would be so awesome
[6:41:45] Coriollis: MAch 5 Poggers
[6:41:56] Angsterz: TRUE
[6:41:57] darkhippo75: I think people dont care about soar but are afraid that Blizzard is still capable to do silly mistakes
[6:42:01] YinYangMan77: Another True
[6:42:02] Sollice: @Towelliee That's what I just said a second ago. Alpha players are the only ones who can complain
[6:42:04] im_n0t_jezus: LUL
[6:42:12] Bleedorang3: Why 950%? Why not 5000%?
[6:42:18] vic_ave: Soar from retail right into Wow Classic
[6:42:18] zgag: Well, the Alpha forums are discussing it and they already have Alpha
[6:42:24] pavepawns: @Sollice i can complain that i dont have alpha to complain Kappa
[6:42:27] yepclocc: i have no problem with the nerf overall if they were honest about it and gave an honest answer, not old mogs and petbattles
[6:42:32] Angsterz: just release the expansion so there is no alpha :D
[6:42:43] ditaern: @StraightErro For that to happen there would have to be no Alpha or Beta, only in-house testing before release.
[6:42:45] Sollice: @Sollice Panda has keys
[6:42:53] Lamp680: It the same with class tuning spells due a specific amount in alpha and they tune it and ppl cry nerf but it was never in main stream hands it just tuning.
[6:42:57] zgag: I don't think it's the ability itself that's the issue, but how it was done
[6:42:58] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[6:43:00] looney199725: people just looking for a reason to complain at this point
[6:43:01] zgag: That's the problem
[6:43:07] zgag: The reason for it ect

[6:43:26] meetwad: get shrek'd, its ogre
[6:43:28] Odinslayer: its not about the nerf towel, its about the idea of the nerf, they reasoning is shit and god knows what else they will fuck up cause of stupid reasoning like this.. its all coming back to shadowlands alpha when we complained about covs and conduits
[6:43:28] looney199725: @Towelliee thats the fact of it
[6:43:33] looney199725: crying for no reason
[6:43:34] dutten_: true and real
[6:43:34] zenkodac: LUL
[6:43:39] zenkodac: facts
[6:43:45] Nehcrom: I am so going to play the sh*t out of evoker.
[6:43:46] evad1971: evad1971 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months, currently on a 28 month streak! 
[6:43:52] yepclocc: @Odinslayer alpha torghast vibes
[6:43:53] YinYangMan77: I know I can't... :D
[6:44:00] wastedxtime93: I'm not big on fire mage, I think the rotation is boring so I'm really hoping I can actually get into Evoker.
[6:44:08] Angsterz: I'm debating naming my dractyr toothless
[6:44:08] zgag: Blizzard has the label of nerfing fun.  The nerf didn't give Blizzard a good look after they have started they were moving away from the old
[6:44:12] Coriollis: we accepted the UwU drakes and moved on thats it we accepted vulpera , we are gonna accept this too xD
[6:44:13] zenkodac: toghast was a completely different case
[6:44:14] looney199725: ever since evoker has been shown all ppl did was cry about it cried about the customization now crying about soar
[6:44:35] Sollice: Plaid speed
[6:44:39] zenkodac: torghast is tied to legenderies and major power gains flying is not
[6:44:39] fluffk1n: other than speed soar is a worse druid flight form so i dont see why its a big deal :p plus 5 min cd
[6:44:50] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee at least i hope they will reduce the cd for soar, even if just in the starting zone
[6:44:54] vic_ave: SO there is a chance?
[6:45:11] looney199725: they cant make everyone happy
[6:45:22] nesman27: its almost like things in an alpha are subject to change Kappa
[6:45:26] Odinslayer: they we will have another shadowlands sadly
[6:45:26] looney199725: its  impossible to make everyone happy
[6:45:26] yepclocc: yeah, and then they released shadowlands
[6:45:27] trailerparkkgamer: blizzard always fucks itself
[6:45:29] MedicineMan: The expansion won't be fun until 10.2 LUL
[6:45:29] Kneckt: no chance in hell
[6:45:31] Angsterz: I bet we get lock/warr/hpal tomorrow
[6:45:37] zgag: I agree. But why have a feedback forum and a special community for feedback if it will not be listened to?
[6:45:38] Wolfenhoof: Thats why i don't look forward to the new crafting until i have it in my own hands.
[6:45:38] ElDrakenMan: woohoo finally some mage gameplay
[6:45:40] soundpraenk: ppl way overreacting over any stupid thing
[6:45:45] Joneeeez: I believe blizzard can do changes whenever they want its alpha/beta live etc, and its good be a good thing to, but there Is risks to ofc
[6:45:48] denflup: just allow dragonrigin everywhere...
[6:45:51] Kasvot_Vaxt: yes
[6:45:53] llNoTToXiCll: ItS AlphA
[6:45:54] moppnitz: no
[6:45:56] Saxuzo: no
[6:45:57] PvtHudson093: BabyRage
[6:45:57] Coriollis: maybe
[6:45:58] looney199725: @zgag because sometimes some of the feedback is stupid
[6:46:00] vic_ave: it doesnt even both me
[6:46:02] yepclocc: @Arnej35 after bfa and shadowlands, which were major disasters in their own right, dont you see why?
[6:46:04] Dankind64: for me, a reasonable adult, maybe LUL
[6:46:04] smiley7878: a cow mage wtf
[6:46:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: we will forget about it in a month
[6:46:09] TheItalianStallion321: I AM OUTRAGED THAT THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS
[6:46:19] YinYangMan77: Not entirely, but actual details help the more...initiated.
[6:46:21] Thund3rH0rs3: i'd still be mad, i wanna fly through old world places at breakneak speed like testers are, it looks fun
[6:46:27] Lostdogal: I just want a Kul Tiran Pally, where's the outrage for that? How can I get that started?
[6:46:28] reggiepowa: yes :)
[6:46:29] zgag: @looney199725 I've only seen negative views from the forums regarding the nerf
[6:46:32] zenkodac: agreed, i just really dislike all the dooming, how fast people start crying the game is dead and create a bunch of new controversial topics
[6:46:32] seanzilla1: there is never realistic sound reasoning, that's why we're always outraged
[6:46:48] Wolfenhoof: then fix your fucking engine !!!111elf Kappa
[6:46:50] vic_ave: Someone will just ask for a new engine
[6:46:57] denflup: LUL
[6:47:03] soundpraenk: @yepclocc so solution is to cry over every single stupid thing that's going to happen? if so, alright, keep doing so
[6:47:04] c0mmander_starscream: yeah mang
[6:47:04] Brodih_: Why dont you upgrade your hardware BabyRage
[6:47:07] zenkodac: like now lfr not being as rewarded as the rest of the difficulties is a issue and people that never had a issue with it now do and make hour long videos on it
[6:47:09] SouvlakiTheBest: tali i like you but defending blizz on ANYTHING is not good in my eyes
[6:47:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: we given it all we got captain, we dont have the power!
[6:47:15] Sollice: Why cant you make my Pinto go 200 miles per hour...We could but we would have to you know....remake a new engine
[6:47:15] yepclocc: @Arnej35 no, but the fire has to be kept to their asses
[6:47:22] onybear: The 100 people that are still in orientation and learning about their benefits?
[6:47:23] macheek: it's like every new xpac ppl are complaining that old zones aren't up to date with new ones
[6:47:25] KnsWoW: download more RAM
[6:47:27] PvtHudson093: mmmmm lunch
[6:47:29] zeitgeiz: With their reasoning…why did the un-nerfed version even make it to alpha. With their reason for nerfing soar,  would have been easy to catch internally.
[6:47:30] vic_ave: With are help we can Hack the gibson!
[6:47:33] nyx_helios: "im paying, so im right" LUL
[6:47:33] YinYangMan77: Meme feedback...the best feedback.
[6:47:36] zgag: Isn't the Alpha forums feedback suppose to be from legit players?  Isn't a focus test?
[6:47:47] Bleedorang3: 2022 and petulant whiners. A match made in heaven.
[6:47:48] looney199725: i cant wait for people to start crying there using old content when people have been begging them to use old cotent
[6:47:50] Nehcrom: Let's rage about the weather instead think we have a greater chance of affecting that than the current issue :P
[6:47:54] Sollice: @VicAva12 HACK THE PLANET.....HACK THE PLANET...HACK THE PLANETTTTTT
[6:48:02] luckfore: download more ram newbbs
[6:48:10] ElDrakenMan: wait till beta when there is thousands of us all zipping around we gonna be begging for a nerf
[6:48:12] ChaosRaiser327: Do you think you can see Dragonriding being implemented in Azeroth in a future patch during Dragonflight's life cycle?
[6:48:15] zgag: If we are calling those players babies and crying about stuff why are they testing the game?
[6:48:20] Redpandalol: @towelliee multi peso company. Blizzard fix yo shiet
[6:48:23] Snabido: "Not this old content, my old content"
[6:48:23] Aidler: in the end we get the expansions blizz wants to give us and they might consider the feedback of the alpha testers aka influencers, top raiders, friends and family. all else doesn’t matter
[6:48:32] Sollice: I hate time walking
[6:48:34] YinYangMan77: @luckfore LUL

[6:48:40] trailerparkkgamer: Imagine defending blizzard with their track record lol
[6:48:42] hatguy156: homie gets bored quikcly
[6:48:54] looney199725: @zgag theres some people who shouldnt be involved in testing if im honest some people are allowed in alpha just cuz there streamers and shouldnt have any part of the say
[6:48:58] Retpally9329: Legion artifacts were old stuff in moderation done well I think
[6:48:58] Biorrwolf: I can't wait for some hardcore dragon riding
[6:48:59] Kneckt: KEKW
[6:49:04] llNoTToXiCll: @ChaosRaiser327  that would kind of flaw out flying BUT i do see it as a good iea to not have fling in Azeroth and instead Dragon riding only
[6:49:05] ElDrakenMan: "new is always better"
[6:49:06] Kneckt: Suprise motherfucker
[6:49:13] ItsGlime: @Towelliee you played any spriest on alpha yet?
[6:49:21] wastedxtime93: Farming Antoran Chardhound is driving me crazy. Can't wait to try for Mollie again tomorrow on like 10 different toons and still get no dumb Alpaca mount lmao
[6:49:22] soundpraenk: @yepclocc but this nerf is not an issue imo, it's a little thing, if they start doing something stupid, sure cry as loud as possible but this? so much drama over this? wow community starts to be crazy with this
[6:49:26] TheItalianStallion321: lol that was like walking up to a cute looking dog and the dog just attacks you lol
[6:49:55] Robodope: I miss my order hall I'd like those to be brought back
[6:50:00] looney199725: whats crazy to me is people are so invested in the soar nerf but no one was mad that the race has 2 cc racials ?
[6:50:08] looney199725: the 2 cc racials are more game breaking than soar
[6:50:08] YinYangMan77: Kinda sad they ditched it...
[6:50:09] yepclocc: @Arnej35 like many have said, its the reason they gave thats making people mad, not so much the nerf itself. if they outright said, hey, our engine is shit, we gotta nerf it, then ok, fine. but pet battles and farming old raids for mogs? come on
[6:50:19] QUICKSILV3R: !ALPHA
[6:50:19] Moobot: @QUICKSILV3R ALPHA PHASE 4 TOMORROW - Dracthyr Starting Zone/Thaldraszus (68-70) Gotta be Warrior week right? | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[6:50:37] zeitgeiz: Moderation, sent you somewhere familiar but added a new area for the story. Artifact quest line, campaign, and the class hall mounts were so good
[6:50:38] Lasidor: Gonna be the Dark Portal flood all over again lol
[6:50:48] looney199725: if they said there engine couldnt handle it people would still complain
[6:50:49] zenkodac: and then everyone went crazy as their right legendary didnt drop and the raid comes out next week
[6:50:53] Demonmingee: Demonmingee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! Woot
[6:50:55] Robodope: having a FF14-style class quest that advances every expansion would be cool.  even if it was just for fluff cosmetics
[6:50:56] looney199725: thats just the wow community nothing is gd enough lately
[6:51:19] bigcountry555: are they still sending alpha invites out and if so is it only for pre ordered players
[6:51:22] Wolfenhoof: we will have one phase where we have to talk to khadgar
[6:51:34] Kneckt: got the best deals anywhere
[6:51:47] Wolfenhoof: good old WoD release vibes
[6:51:49] Biorrwolf: Are there Tauren Rogues yet?
[6:51:54] zgag: @looney199725 There is some very good feedback on the forums and soar is one of those.  I don't see any complaints in terms of just saying something like "Well, this sucks, fuck Blizzard. "  It's very well thought out statements from the testers.  It isn't the general Wow forums that were are talking about it here
