[1:44:25] ArcaneSyntax: It's a content drought because there's been basically no raiding content since August.
[1:44:40] shanhounin: Yep August
[1:44:48] shanhounin: Savage since August
[1:44:51] mavericks312: Damn that’s worse then WoD lmao
[1:45:32] shanhounin: to be fair, they released the Ultimate and the Deep Dungeon during that time, but Savage raiders haven't had anything to do

[1:46:10] Nebulizer87: They have way more content just not pure raids/dungeons
[1:46:43] PvtHudson093: most likely there will be a ff14/16 cross over event
[1:46:48] ArcaneSyntax: I mean it's also a larger issue with how square makes a ton of money off FFXIV and then uses none of that money on the actual game.
[1:47:05] Penguinslol: Gotta use that battle shout

[2:31:36] ObsidianHealer: ayuuNoted
[2:31:37] FioteBearDev: i would like to to a '5-man group HC' like a TT rpg party where you play together all the time and could trade stuff between the group, but if one dies everyone must drop the character and starting again (without players rolling the same class).... just need 4 friends
[2:31:37] the_bad_goat: Like all that shit would have been burnt to hell waiting on all these tusks
[2:31:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Can't make stew without goretusk eyes

[2:32:08] grimmlols: Is this a HC only server or can you play this non HC?
[2:32:12] FioteBearDev: there is already a name for it? KSM classic, i like it lol.
[2:32:32] ArcaneSyntax: This hardcore ksm thing seems a little forced.
[2:32:48] volkreig: Bags of oats are like golddust
[2:32:49] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Is "The Last Epoch" too similar to other games? youtu.be/-2NbpPdVVXU

[2:33:35] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!
[2:33:53] falldrgn: hardcore raiding..I cant even imagineb
[2:34:20] dimofodi: I think the hardcore KSM thing is a bit silly. Everyone I've seen is playing their main class they do M20+ with ease for hours a day on already.
[2:34:22] rhsiuol: they have to be within 500io or something I think
[2:34:31] ChiefMango: can't group with non HC ppl and no 500? io
[2:34:35] ChiefMango: over
[2:34:39] ArcaneSyntax: I feel like classic has an element of randomness to the world that make it more enjoyable.
[2:34:54] FioteBearDev: @falldrgn some HC already did a raid iirc
[2:35:02] bonegazi: if i wanted to make a tank for hc do you suggest warrior or druid?
[2:35:31] geokouts: wardens good for engineering players
[2:35:41] Sayryn: That is what sucks about so many people playing. I had to login and 5AM to find herbs.
[2:35:49] ArcaneSyntax: Like, dying in ksm hardcore because a DPS didn't interrupt isn't the same as dying in classic because you got parried.
[2:36:26] Shadoww_Fox: i died for fall Kappa
[2:36:26] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[2:36:40] dimofodi: That's why KSM HC is pointless. Leveling is super easy. It's easy to get up to 385ish if you farm the hell out of Forbidden Reach and from there if you know how to play, you're getting KSM.
[2:36:44] Zeke_nl: hardcore ksm seems cringe
[2:36:44] veetz21: I cant install classic wtf
[2:36:45] 3dRes: Man is brown bread
[2:36:48] falldrgn: Imean.. you could troll the hell out of groups. by killing people.. because they can't play the toon again

[2:39:04] theDirtyon3: people are dumb
[2:39:08] PhillyRhino: That lvl may have been trying to get the FP for later.
[2:39:11] FioteBearDev: maybe he was questing in elwinn forest and went to redridge to get the FP
[2:39:12] jaykyew: @veetz21 I'm having issues trying to update stuff in Battlenet right now
[2:39:12] adxx: hardcore KSM just feels like diablo 3 hardcore imo lol. Kinda meh

[2:59:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: need ben steins money to afford that
[2:59:51] Daarksyde: that DOES NOT look like $200...
[2:59:52] ShadoodHD: "limited edition" KEKW
[2:59:55] Keglett: shit better be made out of platinum for $200

[3:02:12] SauceFu: I've still never seen a single one of the glaives drop
[3:02:16] ShadoodHD: did they ever mention bringing them back from time to time?
[3:02:20] PvtHudson093: I have Thinderfury and both bindings after 5ish runs of MC

[3:02:49] Effin_Steffin: Ducksauce is hiding out in the Mountains
[3:03:02] ZeusDNA: yeah I think they said things would be back at some point
[3:03:13] ZeusDNA: Don't think they said how long of a period it could be
[3:03:33] Daarksyde: people taking this "gold" statement like Blizz is saying it's done... people are insane

[3:04:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: The devs listened to beta feedback, and doing some fixes is a good thing
[3:04:19] SauceFu: All console games go gold then have day 1 patches
[3:04:38] theDirtyon3: is playable though. yes and thats what matters
[3:04:51] FioteBearDev: @SauceFu because no amount of testing equals live testing haha, some things will always show up when players touch the game

[3:04:54] rhsiuol: dats some cope
[3:04:58] TexValhalla: i swear every time it's like no one has ever played a game on release date and somehow forget and think that there won't be problems LUL
[3:05:03] marineboi1288: how many bosses in the raid did you test alrdy?
[3:05:06] thedamndudedevin: Then what would they learn from an old copy of the game as we played?
[3:05:07] macheight: Ship it now Blizz, I played the beta for 50 hrs. I have withdrawal symptoms cooksuXshake
[3:05:10] feagans: haha can only imagine what their jira ticket log looks like for bugs
[3:05:30] MFKnightS: beta they needed to test servers also
[3:05:38] Sayryn: A little tuning and some bug fixes
[3:05:40] Brodih_: devs did a great update on changes to dungeons, it will be less tidious
[3:05:46] DovahChicken: Atlest they did change the things we wanted for d4
[3:05:50] geokouts: they have done it so people will buy the game after open beta, for people that wanted to try it first
[3:06:02] Anachron10: people expected D3 beta to be a 10th of the game not a 4th
[3:06:03] ZeroTwoW: Its going to be in betta untill D5 Kappa
[3:06:12] Daarksyde: would agree with you there Towel, there is sooo much more content in D4 we have not seen yet and they want it to be a surprise/excitement.
[3:06:15] feagans: @macheight major withdrawal
[3:06:23] Crowargus: this game is gunna be succesful no matter what
[3:06:25] macheight: It was great. The art style is on point.
[3:06:29] Sayryn: Ruh roh
[3:06:53] theDirtyon3: correct
[3:07:00] hammack52: i think the main reason they didnt want to do any further betas was so they basicly didnt give out the game for free
[3:07:00] Crowargus: ive heard no news about it
[3:07:00] smashwow: doesn't surprise me. that shit has to be expensive
[3:07:32] rhsiuol: tsm and clg PepeLaugh
[3:07:34] smashwow: max has been saying it's gonna flop in general
[3:07:34] MixAndFlix: did he die?
[3:07:35] im_capy: everything lol
[3:07:42] smashwow: too much money no return
[3:07:59] geokouts: 70 for the basic for D$, lots of money
[3:08:13] geokouts: d4
[3:08:15] theDirtyon3: they didnt do shit LUL
[3:08:17] SexWhen: towliee who thought of this idea to use this interface for reacting ? u know most ppl use phones to watch you, and making the react screen smaller is just retarded idea as we cant see it on phones its to small
[3:08:24] im_capy: blizz learned it with OW esports, they went BIG with that in the start
[3:08:26] theDirtyon3: they had some analysts
[3:08:28] BTiZZY_: i feel like way too many companies went it hard thinking esports was going to go mainstream and it’s not going to get that popular
[3:08:30] theDirtyon3: thats about it
[3:08:52] Brodih_: @geokouts yeah its 100$ canadian... its expensive. BUT you'll get 100+ hours of content easily
[3:08:52] theDirtyon3: r word monkaS
[3:09:05] im_capy: esports, the dot com bubble of our time
[3:09:07] N3llee: just tuning in this morning.. whats hot
[3:09:12] Rottencoarse: cloud 9
[3:09:22] hammack52: big problem with Esports at least for WoW is there is no real compitition in it any more, everyone pretty much knows whos going to win
[3:09:24] emznev: @baldomort sounds like a you problem SMOrc PogChamp
[3:09:28] StreamElements: Use code FACTORSE36440 for 50% off your first box at https://strms.net/factor75_towelliee
[3:09:34] hammack52: its just getting boring
[3:09:34] TexValhalla: imagine complaining on how a streamer does his streaming content on his channel LUL
[3:09:41] SauceFu: I must be the only one who never watches Twitch on my phone
[3:09:46] ShadoodHD: also some merchandise here and there but who really cares Kappa
[3:10:06] Sayryn: Sloot said BDGG has lost a lot of the management structure.
[3:10:44] emznev: 2 weeks till 10.1 dragonflight shaping up to be one of the best expansions yet?
[3:11:05] xhaven: nah Im at home so using pc
[3:11:05] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!
[3:11:06] Eviltuna13: I’ll predict if Echo wins this next tier there’s is going to be a major shake up for Liquid
[3:11:19] spiked16: @Towelliee Morning, how is HC going ??
[3:11:20] SkytheWoW: i think when it comes to watching gaming not as many people care about excellence, I'd rather just hang in a stream than watch esports
[3:11:24] Zeke_nl: whatever happened to undad i never see him streaming must have quit
[3:11:27] Brayy47: as much as i love the race but its really just a race to world third we always will know who gets 1 and 2
[3:11:31] ShadoodHD: oh yea gg head of esports left
[3:11:35] TexValhalla: i mean let's be honest it comes down to the same 3-4 MAYBE 5 guilds every race and even then it's usually the same 2 in the end soooooo
[3:11:35] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[3:11:51] Sayryn: I just wish they would do a Global release to start the race.
[3:11:52] emznev: The races in bfa were the best
[3:12:04] hammack52: this is what happens in any stagnant format, if the teams want to make this something that will grow and last they would need to break up the tops teams and spread the talent out more so there is compitition again
[3:12:08] tr4ncetv: splits and community helping make it not that fun to watch imo
[3:12:08] Alienfromger: watching hundreds of splits isnt fun
[3:12:15] tr4ncetv: that too
[3:12:16] danimoto10: well because it starting to get boring, we just looking at the same thing every time
[3:12:19] Brayy47: split runs have been around they just streamed it this time
[3:12:27] emznev: Method going to win this time towIgnit ResidentSleeper
[3:12:42] Brayy47: yea a guild needs to drop that much money to have even a fighting chance
[3:12:44] xhaven: I agree but what can you do? I dont fault liquid/echo for being the best currently
[3:12:53] ZeusDNA: I love watching the race for the hilarious liquid commentary KEKW
[3:12:54] Moobot:  The website has gotten a...hellish..makeoever https://www.towelliee.com/ to keep updated on everything that's going on with the WoW:DF Marathons. Backgrounds, goals and giveaways, talents and UI we have it all!
[3:12:55] tszord: 50 wow players versus the rest of us
[3:12:55] raldrik: its also the timing of it. You never know when to watch to see anything interesting
[3:13:00] tylerwithghosts: Echo going on that late 90's Chicago Bulls run
[3:13:02] smashwow: you can if you get another yosh in there Kappa
[3:13:02] ArcaneSyntax: Unfortunately a 2 guild race is more interesting than the other events where echo wins all of them
[3:13:02] ChonkzillaTV: Same reason I stopped watching F1. Gets boring when Merc is 25 seconds ahead of everyone else.
[3:13:20] danimoto10: at the end of the day the viewership will drop sponsers will go away and then the 2 guilds will just say fuck it
[3:13:31] shtcricket: Would be cool to see wow implement some raid ID character limits so you CANT funnel and split and require alts
[3:13:39] im_capy: need to evolve into just MMO Guilds, they race to world first with them all. Less content drought
[3:13:43] volkreig: Liquid could get some major clout if they win next RWF considering echo got the triad
[3:13:46] sakura_2020: they got into the pvp scene aswell
[3:13:54] hammack52: if you want this to grow and stay fresh and not just fall apart than that is what has to be done, its not about how a raid is done its about trying to build up to keep this going into the future
[3:13:56] Crowargus: need  liquid to win to honestly spice the race up
[3:14:01] tylerwithghosts: Who's the Dennis Rodman of Echo? @Towelliee
[3:14:19] Zookana: pubg
[3:14:21] Eggz1004: isnt Echo doing things like FF14 races when they have new content? or no?
[3:14:22] N3llee: some day a new mmo will arise that pushes the mmo meta as we know it know and everyone will switch
[3:14:24] TexValhalla: i will say that nerf they did on this first raid was a little cucked though lol not taking away the win though
[3:14:33] emznev: Echo are to good imo they going to keep winning
[3:14:39] Zeke_nl: @tylerwithghosts neither, dennis rodman was a tough
[3:14:48] im_capy: been waiting for that for a looooong time
[3:14:50] ArcaneSyntax: It's actually commendable NA does as well as it does in the rwf considering we have less players
[3:14:53] Sayryn: I hate that Liquid has been first to kill most bosses, but then loses on the last boss or two.
[3:14:54] SauceFu: Been saying that for 20 years
[3:15:01] theoriginalzinng: no end boss testing is going to hamper things again for the race and as long as blizzard is doing that it can wall one or both of the teams
[3:15:18] volkreig: Any idea when we'll see the next RWF announcement, like liquids or echoes or method
[3:15:44] ChonkzillaTV: Why not stop splits and make RWF something like a fixed roster?
[3:15:44] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[3:15:53] TexValhalla: @volkreig within this next week prolly
[3:16:04] raldrik: still begging for budget
[3:16:17] ChonkzillaTV: and make it 25 man only. Add rules to rwf
[3:16:17] ArcaneSyntax: @sayryn it feels like NA tests bosses still.
[3:16:22] xhaven: @ChonkzillaTV what do you mean exactly?
[3:16:29] scridderz: i think you'll see a random guild of awesome peeps roll through and wipe them, all out and take the win.  that'd be EPIC
[3:16:39] Eviltuna13: What’s also hurting Liquid is more people are watching Max stream then the official Liquid stream so that’s loss revenue
[3:16:53] Sollice: I was on a work call I missed it. So did Big Dumb Guild leave Golden Guardians ESPORTs team and they are back to a normal guild/
[3:16:59] Alienfromger: plus all the donations from stream
[3:17:06] BTiZZY_: nah he splits it @eviltuna13
[3:17:10] im_capy: sponsors want that viewership
[3:17:12] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  you need to fly your production team a week early at least to build up the scene
[3:17:16] Brodih_: Max should not stream the race tbh
[3:17:21] TexValhalla: @Sollice ya
[3:17:23] DecayedmiNt: Max splits all of it to all of liquid
[3:17:24] ArcaneSyntax: It's a shame because I love max, but the liquid production value is good
[3:17:29] Rudric_Ice: is this game back from the dead ?
[3:17:56] emznev: @rudric_ice was never dead lol
[3:17:59] Smoakezy: Bro these E-Sports teams creating artificial overhead trying to create hype. Their business models aren't great
[3:18:01] im_capy: was the last race viewership higher or lower than before minus Echo
[3:18:04] Sayryn: I don't want to listen to the "analysis"
[3:18:06] raldrik: I like to hear some of the coms instead of the casters make bad jokes
[3:18:07] SauceFu: I prefer the individuals, the casters jump around the POV too much
[3:18:11] volkreig: Max has the personality and is probably the face of the team, hard to try and drive interested probably
[3:18:25] theoriginalzinng: also, hot take: if the race ends up becoming less popular, maybe blizzard will reconsider changing size or even going flex size for mythic raid
[3:18:25] Sollice: It was lower because of the splits
[3:18:28] DarkIntentz: @Rudric_Ice When was it "dead" it wasn't as great at some point but dead? oo
[3:18:32] Sollice: and its going to be lower this one because of the splits
[3:18:34] ChonkzillaTV: If you want to get WF make it 25 man, and make it a fixed roster. Where you cannot sub ppl in. That may even out the player field.
[3:18:35] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Is "The Last Epoch" too similar to other games? youtu.be/-2NbpPdVVXU
[3:18:45] Rudric_Ice: bcuz nobody cares about wow after shadowlands
[3:18:49] xhaven: I prefer the casters most of the time myself
[3:18:51] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i think echo having preach,dratnos and tettles is making the echo stream numbers high imo
[3:18:51] Alienfromger: echo had the "best entertaining" caters isnt it?
[3:18:57] volkreig: Not to mention probably more EU watching then NA apparently
[3:18:58] ChonkzillaTV: Spamming for ppl to help in chat. That is cheap af
[3:19:08] im_capy: Blizz should add some twitch drops for it too, double dip and get that viewership booming
[3:19:28] Jakmuiz: Nobody cares about or understands RWF.
[3:19:38] volkreig: Hope theres no more drama this RWF with casters, always cringe when that happens
[3:19:53] SauceFu: They were playing from LA so it made sense
[3:19:56] Mozzeyy_: I feel like the decision to release all the difficulties at the same time is a huge L
[3:20:15] ArcaneSyntax: Echos stream it was kinda hard to see information about the boss, # of pulls, best pull and things like lust and brezzes
[3:20:15] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!
[3:20:16] jerseyfive: liquid is only max
[3:20:18] TexValhalla: agreed, add drops during the RWF on twitch and you got all the views back again
[3:20:19] Rottencoarse: @volkreig  i do not think echo saw the thing happened with rich
[3:20:28] SauceFu: @Mozzeyy_ Hard disagree. It only affects the race and Blizz doesn't care
[3:20:53] wowdin: Haven’t watched in a while. Looking good towlie!
[3:20:54] Moobot:  The website has gotten a...hellish..makeoever https://www.towelliee.com/ to keep updated on everything that's going on with the WoW:DF Marathons. Backgrounds, goals and giveaways, talents and UI we have it all!
[3:21:17] BTiZZY_: they got no personalities outside of max sadly
[3:21:25] mithdrax: 0 period i will always forget lol
[3:21:32] Smoakezy: Treat it like a NFL roster, treat your best player like the QB on the roster, they're going to bring in the views so pay them accordingly. Just as a starting Safety isn't paid as much as the QB or even a cornerback.
[3:21:33] belfastcl: being a good player and being a good entertainer are properties that a single person rarely has together

[3:47:52] ZachTriesTooHard: I need a MOP classic
[3:47:55] TexValhalla: because cata was a dumpster
[3:48:11] Gengisman: @BlueBlurPrime Does it use bow and javalin=
[3:48:14] emznev: Cata was poggers
[3:48:20] ObsidianHealer: Yep
[3:48:20] emznev: SMOrc
[3:48:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think Cata Classic is coming, but it's going to need a lot of changes to sell it to people
[3:48:34] ObsidianHealer: They need to expand on Classic if anything.
[3:48:38] emznev: Wotlk kinda failed then?
[3:48:40] Maydie6066: Classic Classic WoW
[3:48:40] BlueBlurPrime: bow yes, no javelins this time
[3:48:41] N3llee: @emznev worse take in the history of wow
[3:48:45] RyzuxTV: They should just make servers for every expansion, so they kill every single private server. Then let people play on whatever expansion they want with just a single sub

[3:49:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: my classic guild lost to the roster boss
[3:49:01] roflpotamus: Skip to Cata PLS
[3:49:04] cschimp: They should've went the classic+ route, people just keep saying they want other expansions but barely even play
[3:49:05] BTiZZY_: honestly i’m playing no hc classic era and it’s booming
[3:49:05] emznev: @n3llee and thats your opinion mateyy
[3:49:06] TexValhalla: if they ever do MoP classic it'll pick up i feel
[3:49:09] abracka_: it lines up with how populated private servers are for each xpac. vanilla and wotlk are by far the most populated. cata servers only ever see 3-500 people
[3:49:21] N3llee: @emznev facts
[3:49:28] Mozzeyy_: True, i wanted to do ulduar but couldnt give a shit about totc or even icc
[3:49:29] N3llee: yea I am done with classic when ICC drops.
[3:49:43] bunta80: Don't forget ruby sanctum xD
[3:49:44] MeisterPetze: finaly farm invincible again :D
[3:49:55] Wulfgrym: cata will be a massive mistake for classic
[3:49:55] 3ll3nwood: 100% on this take
[3:49:56] abracka_: if they do cata classic there is gonna be a exodus lol
[3:50:00] Sayryn: I hope they stop at Wrath
[3:50:01] cschimp: people always said that wow was ruined with cata, now people say they want cata classic. Just need to do classic+ and get rid of everything else
[3:50:02] Effin_Steffin: Is HC a Blizz thing or Private Server thing?
[3:50:02] Snabido: Nah, jousting is the peak part of wrath era CoolCat
[3:50:09] rosina_scarlett: @Effin_Steffin player driven thing
[3:50:10] Baldarsar: cata classic would be shit !!!
[3:50:14] ZachTriesTooHard: @Effin_Steffin its an addon for classic
[3:50:17] Mitchendo64: The answer is to make hc classic+ and then take the best things from later expansions and implement them into classic+ but idk if blizzard wants to spend that kind of money
[3:50:18] Baldarsar: the need to stop
[3:50:39] raldrik: People like the leveling grind in Classic/Vanilla without knowing it. Feels like an accomplishment to max level. That is gone from Wrath forward
[3:50:48] rosina_scarlett: Hardcore servers or Vanimma +
[3:50:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Hardcore servers would rock, I think
[3:50:53] Alepouditsa: i didn't play classic this time becose off the new expension i am having fun there, the ones befor that i play on classic coz i was evoiding SL
[3:50:57] abracka_: keep world buffs for raids though
[3:50:57] PotbellyGoat: they should announce the survival mmo at blizzcon
[3:50:59] rosina_scarlett: Vanilla*
[3:51:04] Mitchendo64: oh no not another season of mastery where you toon gets deleted at the end
[3:51:05] Sayryn: and have an SSF leaderboard
[3:51:08] OathXP: retail servers up
[3:51:10] RyzuxTV: Vanimma+ Kappa
[3:51:11] 3ll3nwood: The people have spoken!
[3:51:18] ZachTriesTooHard: it said an hour
[3:51:24] Wulfgrym: i haven't played wow since wrath classic launch but im tempted to resub for vanilla hc
[3:51:25] Calphurnious: They really should go wild with rule sets or something for crazy experiments
[3:51:32] SauceFu: retail is up
[3:51:34] Mitchendo64: Did Blizzard lowkey put in hc servers without any media?
[3:51:35] volkreig: reload?
[3:51:43] ZachTriesTooHard: what level did you get up to? I died at 15 on my rogue to some murlocs, back up to 12 now lol
[3:51:45] hammack52: those servers should be coming up soon cause the retail servers are up
[3:51:47] crazycarl_1: Would you keep the NO AH rule ? I would but im not sure about trading
[3:51:50] begonias710: Are you for, against , or don’t care for classic +
[3:51:51] TexValhalla: retail is up if you wanna do your boxes though
[3:51:52] BTiZZY_: @wulfgrym my bud and i are playing non hc and it’s a blast
[3:51:58] Masqerader: classic servers ran on hamster power, someone probably forgot to go to the pet store
[3:52:05] BlueBlurPrime: still 4 min for vault
[3:52:11] hammack52: vault has not flipped yet
[3:52:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[3:52:36] LordOverflow: biggest issue will be how they would handle griefing on official hc
[3:52:43] CloudPants8081: pvp on too? Kappa
[3:53:05] Aelissia: I could imagine them just making it simple, no appeals. You die, you die. Start over.

[3:53:26] JohnNatalis: Blizz should just say we'll give you HC, but we won't do any moderation. You die, you die \o/

[3:53:43] ZachTriesTooHard: @Towelliee classicHC addon has a function where if you die to griefing it auto appeals. Happened to me last night with teremus in stormwind. It let me rez due to "malicious activity"

[3:54:01] RyzuxTV: @treeoflol Bloodsail Buccaneers
[3:54:05] RegadorTV: wrath is still good alot of ppl enjoy it
[3:54:07] K_A_N_J_I: Boosting is too risky for hardcore. I think they just need to address grief and maybe make pvp bgs kinda like war games it gives no xp but you can die in there so people can’t grind it for xp.
[3:54:16] BTiZZY_: he was the go to classic guy

[3:55:27] the_viznar: soooooo reaady for SL Classic
[3:55:34] falldrgn: leveling progression would b e jacked
[3:55:41] Zivs: woke up to John Hight responding to elon musk tweet, gave me a giggle

[3:56:09] MuttonChopins: I've heard players like the classes from Wrath more than vanilla
[3:56:11] NobodybetterPat: does wrath still not have lfg?
[3:56:11] Anthonydude3: yeah after you get one or two character level cap it sucks leveling
[3:56:14] falldrgn: yeah not having LFG in Classic wraith was stupid... like the content is not that hard.
[3:56:17] EpicJune: Feel Cata is the tilting point for some. Start was great. then dragon soul came out LUL
[3:56:22] MoodyVanessa: i stopped playing Wrath because of not having lfg
[3:56:25] MFKnightS: then the people complaining all they had to do was not use it....
[3:56:28] 3ll3nwood: They should put in dungeon finder with Togc to boost numbers
[3:57:04] falldrgn: what TW is it this week?

[3:57:49] NickLeonhearth: No LFG! they need the "community" aspect Kappa
[3:57:57] BTiZZY_: wrath leveling blows
[3:57:57] azurrei: I would do more than raid log if they implemented RDF

[3:58:24] LuiBMHunter: You broke em!
[3:58:26] MuttonChopins: been thinking about leveling a new toon in wrath but 1-80 is way too much of a hassle, LFG would be really nice to have
[3:58:31] HeyItsForza: classic is up for me
[3:58:32] SkyTheDM: Classic devs are playing New World
[3:58:35] Shugaze: weird they not up yet

[3:59:06] firehawk73: go do your Vault to see if the Bronze spec drops this week
[3:59:11] Splashdownn: why dont they just put it in with toc? like they did back in wrath
[3:59:27] honkblarg: there is a reason why most mmos after wrath have a LFG system
[3:59:37] reggiepowa: You following naowh hc ksm challenge
[3:59:38] gufubb: So what's going on? You guys are about to attack a boss or something?

[5:22:43] k0nvick_: guess i should say ironforge for thrown not just IF kek
[5:22:59] adxx: yeah its a double edged sword. if one of you die you both delete. its easier to do content, but obviously more punishing if something goes wrong
[5:22:59] EnderPandaPlayz: gotcha. I saw that rule about if one dies you both die, thats why I wasn't sure about healing
[5:23:01] Fugazi811: you have to state you're a group at level 1 cannot just randomly group

[5:50:02] adxx: My HC guild is debating right now whether blizzard should retain the No AH/Trading/Mail rule or not. Kinda funny but i told them i just doubt they will enforce it
[5:50:03] Moobot: Spellcraft is a new type of a strategy game: a real-time battler. Play in the public alpha on Steam now through April 16! https://go.playspellcraft.com/TowellieeAlpha
[5:50:19] cwitt0636: they should drop 2 at a time per murloc lol
[5:50:29] Superman_KalEl: I remember the drop rate being garbage in vanilla
[5:50:50] adxx: I also don't think they will enforce the "1 run dungeon" rule too. Like, they won't change game code for that
[5:50:55] KontrolStyle: @Superman_KalEl, well yeah, just mean for you to kill more mobs
[5:51:04] L__E__A__F: i like that, gives a good foundation and then you can walk backwards to 60 if you want LUL
[5:51:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: They could remove the auction house from hardcore servers, but people would probably spaz
[5:51:14] dreamwalker213: On an official hardcore server, everyone will be hardcore so it makes AH okay
[5:51:23] peardraxz: the one dugeon role really gimps warriors :(
[5:51:24] 3dRes: dayKrablarRoll Li'l Crabbies dayKrablarRoll
[5:51:26] fistofnature: do you still have to delete your character if you die at 60?
[5:51:28] Highparkk_: AH will just invite botting and gold buying to HC
[5:51:46] jkitchin75: @fistofnature yes
[5:52:18] Highparkk_: i think 60 is totally fine for ah
[5:52:28] ZachTriesTooHard: you actually dont "have" to, its just taboo to keep it. Even in the hardcore rules it says 60 = immortality
[5:52:30] JohnNatalis: dont they already have no trading/mail/AH code for trial accounts already at hand?
[5:52:35] anjunadeepa: They should turn off mailbox and ah until 60 @
[5:52:39] EeVeTV: that'd be very easy to code. one if statement
[5:52:39] machine_723: HC community leaders already said there ok with ah and mail if the server is hardcore
[5:52:40] Karn1987: speck of bronzes dust is from the chest in the new vault
[5:53:11] Highparkk_: for me, the whole self found aspect of HC makes it so much fun
[5:53:14] HooDGorE: yes only buying and trading with other HC is fine imo
[5:53:17] ZachTriesTooHard: if player.level is not 60: trade.disable
[5:53:19] k0nvick_: should be fairly easy for them to code that once a player hits 60 they can interact with the ah and trade kind of like how you need to be lvl 10 to see talents
[5:53:33] bunta80: Isn't there something already in their code as trial accounts can't trade and use AH?
[5:53:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think hardcore servers definitely need leaderboards and even account-wide achievements

[5:54:11] Highparkk_: they could just make named mobs/highly killed mobs a shared tag
[5:54:19] Lolajugs: Any official news on blizzard hardcore servers ?
