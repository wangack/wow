[4:02:52] Pups_Gersky: Its not technically an exploit, but how people have been doing it seems like it is. but Blizzard reversed the dungeon reset. So now it has no cooldown and you can reset as many times as you see fit. So during the seasonal questline, you can farm the final dungeon but don't complete the quest and that's how people farm Barber.
[4:03:11] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!

[4:07:51] Pallyofhell: https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/aspect/aspect-of-the-barber-1452653
[4:07:57] Pallyofhell: thats the gem ppl run
[4:08:02] KevinAlanK: Swifty why do you play with no guild?
[4:08:34] Pallyofhell: the barber can apply to more than 1 target at a time as well
[4:09:24] Pallyofhell: its all stored dmg on 1 target into an aoe proc
[4:10:10] bolddywow: swifty is prot pala good for rbgs ?
[4:10:16] Pallyofhell: 4 seconds
[4:10:22] Pups_Gersky: 4 is bis
[4:10:48] Pallyofhell: i think its 15% dmg at max roll
[4:11:21] Assuracus: What race is this toon?
[4:11:50] Eliman101: darki iron dwarf
[4:11:53] Pallyofhell: so the stored dmg would be increased by 60% dmg on a max roll barber

[5:29:40] Vx_Odessa_xV: @swifty - Hey Swifty, just got here, no trolling intended with this man, but is there a reason the volume seems to be so low during matches? Like I hardly hear you, or the guys speaking with ya at all, its really muffled and far off sounding, like across the room sounding
[5:29:48] chroniikzINC: oh thats huge!

[5:30:17] Slayer_Eagleone: i wish it was 1800
[5:30:19] chroniikzINC: yeh im a 1600 pleb lmao
[5:30:24] SeeStarss: They argue a lot. xD
[5:30:37] Slayer_Eagleone: blizzard doesnt understand that most players cant ever reach 2100
[5:30:56] Slayer_Eagleone: i hope next season they make it 1800
[5:31:03] chroniikzINC: @Swifty its soooo nice
[5:31:20] chroniikzINC: the current aspirant set is dope also for plate

[5:32:43] chroniikzINC: its like the level 20 keystone teleports haha
[5:32:46] MaxFel18: While you can grind your season 2 mythic rating pretty fast when a new season is out
[5:32:53] Pallyofhell: 1800 isnt that hard to get in RBG's tho
[5:33:03] Banye23: Rank 1  alts are still hovering between 2.1 and 2.3, gotta beat supa's healer alt to get a silly weapon enchant
[5:33:54] inflow459: Is the 1800, is that account wide, so you get all gear on all chars, im gussing no?
[5:33:56] Killyx: The mage in your group is goated that guy is a different breed
[5:33:58] JattixTV: @Pallyofhell Pally imagine this, I just got kicked from a heroic Sark group on my blood dk. The lead was mad I was number 2 on dps and number 1 on healing done
[5:34:10] MaxFel18: So you think Solo q rbg would be better than solo shuffle ? @swifty
[5:34:17] MaxFel18: I mean im asking sorry
[5:34:19] Pallyofhell: in pve/pvp if you want to push any kind of rating you want to do it early in the season due to the amount of players doing it
[5:34:31] Slayer_Eagleone: the point is its not fair for the rest of players that we cant get this awesome pvp illussion cause were just stuck at 1600 not our fault its so deflated
[5:34:39] MrQuicksilver22: Isn't the amount of people who get 2100 pvp rating vs people who get 2500 mythic rating like less then 1 %?
[5:34:40] Pallyofhell: @JattixTV bruh pugs have been making my brain melt
[5:35:09] chroniikzINC: yeh i think so i just dont know how @Swifty but i have heard of it being available
[5:35:09] JattixTV: @Pallyofhell no doubt bro, like it has been rough lately
[5:35:16] Pallyofhell: 2500 mythic rating isnt that difficult
[5:35:20] mikael_jansson90: think its called Berserking in pve
[5:35:29] SeeStarss: There is nothing wrong with having items and mounts locked behind a skill ceiling. It is only a matter of if the system is good.
[5:35:29] Slayer_Eagleone: @MrQuicksilver22 2100 is like top 3% no?
[5:35:42] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[5:35:51] Pallyofhell: 1% is 2.3 or 2.4k rating in pvp
[5:35:56] Vx_Odessa_xV: @swifty - Hardest part of RBGs is just getting together the people willing to play as a cognitive unit and for the greater goal of the team, and not having the toxic players that the game is plagued with that are all about “me me me” and do things as what they feel is for the best, and called for action, ignoring the input of the others they are working with to win the match.
[5:36:13] MrQuicksilver22: yeah but the amount of people who get that are like a couple of hunderd vs mythic 2500 rating is tens of thousands
[5:36:25] Banye23: They should just go back to percentile based rewards
[5:36:34] Pallyofhell: thats because of the m+ meta slaves
[5:36:34] Slayer_Eagleone: @Pallyofhell what about 2100?
[5:36:43] MaxFel18: Player retention in blizzard mind maybe, but it only does the total opposite
[5:37:06] younglettuc: people should be sble to craft weapon glows
[5:37:39] Pallyofhell: i think in legion i was like almost 50 rets on area 52 with 2.9k M+ rating
[5:37:46] Slayer_Eagleone: i just get salty cause im going to miss out on this awesome enchant and its not really my fault
[5:38:04] chroenix: how much do you pay for car insurance?
[5:38:23] Pallyofhell: there will be more next season
[5:38:28] Vx_Odessa_xV: @swifty - Exactly, the moment you lose a single group its like you’re suddenly in a 5 man mythic+ key with Ragnaros players..the second something bad happened and they’re darting for the doors, cause having to put forth effort and work through the challenges that face their team is just too much to ask, and they want only the spoonfed handout on a silver plate, and nothing but it.
[5:38:31] Banye23: The s1 and s2 enchants look wildly different
[5:38:34] Pallyofhell: i pay like 83 a month
[5:39:01] Pallyofhell: yea full coverage
[5:39:19] chroenix: you should consider Geico
[5:39:26] chroniikzINC: @swifty there is an enchant on ah drops from magmorax called Shadowflame wreath pretty sure thats the enchant for the weapon not sure how it works tho
[5:39:33] Knozyr: Swifty that was a mental game
[5:39:46] Slayer_Eagleone: as a gamer i could never get married i never have time
[5:39:48] Pallyofhell: @chroniikzINC its not the same visual
[5:39:49] Banye23: Get that fatty mfj standard deduction on your taxes
[5:40:00] chroenix: thats love
[5:40:09] Knozyr: Health Insurance is free in the UK :D
[5:40:10] Knozyr: mental
[5:40:17] Pallyofhell: @chroniikzINC the actual enchant doesn't unlock the pvp visual
[5:40:31] Slayer_Eagleone: real gamers dont have time for a wife trust me lol
[5:40:36] Knozyr: do you ever upload vods?
[5:40:59] Knozyr: I need a #rewatch on that game
[5:41:28] Vx_Odessa_xV: @swifty - Please excuse the long post comments, Swifty..my rambling on and being overly detailed and drawn out with things be it in verbal chat or texting..is a trait of my Aspergers Syndrome, Autism..but I will try to dial it back here some and not go writing you a book every post..texting this all here from my phone, hahaha, so I dont see the post length til I post it, haha.
