[4:31:21] Renethadox: @Urpalmax what about it ?
[4:31:26] gaalmonkey: I honestly don't think so, having played both comps in decent rating, I'm betting on disc feral
[4:31:45] Renethadox: disc feral imo should win ebcause of instant clones, bear stun, cat stun
[4:31:47] Renethadox: mana burns
[4:31:50] Renethadox: dispels and other factors
[4:32:03] cepsegnever: @gaalmonkey at highest rating is how pojke does, but 99% of the time which is lower rating than that feral priest win most of the games in that matchup
[4:32:05] Renethadox: but SM warrior with RS 25 hc gear
[4:32:09] cepsegnever: says*
[4:32:10] Renethadox: idk it depends on map also

[6:21:59] DrCokePhD: every warmane player uses ahk its just an addon at this point
[6:22:00] Turaxyy: no way
[6:22:16] DrCokePhD: if u dont use ahk its just setting yourself up for disadvantage
[6:22:32] cepsegnever: @DrCokePhD this is so sad but true
[6:22:37] cepsegnever: as warpal atleast
[6:23:03] Urpalmax: srenix speedrunning r1 ladder??
[6:23:09] Evilhoney: think they have ahk on the blizzcon computers?
[6:23:14] GarrinchA: was chokopapa that insane ?
[6:23:16] shizophrenla: nope
[6:23:27] DrCokePhD: its crazy how ex warmane players will literally stream their inputs with abilities flashing 1000 times a second when ahk gets triggered kek
[6:23:43] DrCokePhD: and its like no big deal to anyone
[6:24:28] notmorbos: what do you expect anyone to do about it?
[6:24:29] Urpalmax: well idk it’s not like you need ahk to win, there are people at r1 ladder without it isn’t huge imo
[6:25:06] DrCokePhD: its definitely huge because you cant fake ahk'ers whatseover, they will literally only use abilities when interruptable etc
[6:25:18] DrCokePhD: takes the human element out of it somewhat
[6:25:19] t4imz: almost
[6:25:28] cepsegnever: insane how broken mage is he can still win 1v2
[6:25:30] Urpalmax: ??? do you know what ahk does
[6:25:35] cepsegnever: jammin??
[6:25:42] Xeckslol: These guys just stream sniping?
[6:25:48] Urpalmax: @drcokephd what do you think ahk does
[6:26:00] Shazzie17: that team plays 1 game a day nice
[6:26:07] DrCokePhD: its not just ahk, its ahk with scripts that probe for enemy casts
[6:26:22] Urpalmax: yea so what you just said about interrupt have nothing to do with ahk
[6:26:24] afterpartyboy: whats ahk?
[6:26:57] DrCokePhD: it is, because they can hold a button and interrupt a blind fake and get full benefit from it because ahk literally only triggers when the script says enemy is casting X/Y/Z
[6:27:11] Urpalmax: “you can’t fake ahkers whatsoever” this is a false statement

[6:27:42] Urpalmax: they are not the same thing, if you wanna talk about scripts sure but I thought you were discussing ahk
[6:28:01] Brodin1231: aha is like removing in online chess

[6:28:42] Teacube: What healing spec are you most looking forward to playing in cata?
[6:29:02] cepsegnever: you can land globals with ahk that you are gonna hardly pull without, specially between cc @Urpalmax, if that's not an advantage...
[6:29:41] Urpalmax: I didn’t say it was NOT an advantage, I said it isn’t huge. I would consider scripting FAR more impactful
[6:30:17] Urpalmax: but my opinion is irrelevant
[6:30:19] cepsegnever: it is impactful tho, otherwise ppl wouldn't risk getting ban for it
[6:30:38] ekunx: where's your CTS? Peepo
[6:31:04] DrCokePhD: sad thing is i agree with you in a sense, but ahk kinda goes hand in hand with scripts
[6:31:04] beagleboy420: does the mage stream
[6:32:00] Urpalmax: @drcokephd what do you mean here?? that the vast majority of people who use ahk also use scripts?
[6:32:21] DrCokePhD: yea, id go so far to suggest as much, at least those in the top 5 bracket
[6:32:38] Urpalmax: which ones in the top five do you think are scripting?
[6:33:15] DrCokePhD: i would name names but idk if its suitable to bring that kind of drama to this very stream, completely unasked for
