I'm not worried about loot or M+ raids, they'll do catch up gear events before next expac anyways.

[7:36:40] DuKeIt0uT: @SnowballEOD, ok so basically when you hit 60 instead of all the mobs scaling to your level no matter where you go that will get disabled and then if you're 60 and you go back to WOTLK for example the mobs will be somewhere around 30 to 40 and you will CRUSH them
[7:36:41] Gunznrocketz: i think 55 is doable today, 56 sounds exhausting
[7:36:46] SnowballEOD: @pottoman But if you don't timewalk then the zones are "current." So you can't experience like, Wetlands, Pre-Cataclysm, without timewalking.

[7:38:03] DuKeIt0uT: @SnowballEOD, @pottoman if you go talk to Chromie before you hit 60 and want "vanilla" zones before Cata you actually can't do that

[11:15:00] iplaythings: @PenitentTang3nt Sir, you do realize that BiS lists can varie so much depending on the pieces available? PepeLaf
[11:15:02] j_gsaw: 1INTCHAT
[11:15:03] IcyZzzz: i remember grinding on dungeons and people telling me to get the +healing gear. it fucked me over not having spirit when leveling
[11:15:03] Slaymeh: and less time spent drinking PepeLaugh
[11:15:04] LetMeDieFirst: what happens when you die in softcore?
[11:15:05] DrunkLoliOgre: Classic andy BrokeBack

[11:15:13] druid1000: also BiS is different depending on what you're doing. Obv it's different for dungeons than for solo leveling
[11:15:15] ArtoPOE: @Sandap no way youre that much of an npc surely
[11:15:23] solartech0: @iplaythings BiS is whatever I say it is (best I say)

[11:15:32] obsequiesce: PepoThink
[11:15:34] Nerfsound: its like an item build for a hero in Dota in a rel game and turbo mode. why would you buy mana ring in Turbo? softcore & hardcore are different build requirments
[11:15:38] Sandap: Esstand Also raid composition. Skill level of people you play with, etc. Trying to say "This is objectively the best" is stupid PepeLaf
[11:15:39] PenitentTang3nt: iplaythings wait are you replying to mee or the other guy monkaHmm
[11:15:43] DuKeIt0uT: yeah in retail there is bis based on leveling/solo/dungeon/raid and single target/aoe like what are we even talking about here

[11:16:16] PenitentTang3nt: iplaythings np PepeLaf
[11:16:23] dont_google_dqw4w9wgxcq: maybe bis list applies to raiding,  i'm not even sure. but even in this case, he's not even 60 to think about it KEK
[11:16:25] Sandap: ArtoPOE Good players don't use BIS lists because they understand the game well enough to know what gear is best for their situation.
[11:16:27] MacintoshPLUS21: Slaymeh stop TheVoices

[11:17:15] iplaythings: worst part about bis is that people rarely consider, "bis for what?"  If you're an aoe farming mage you just want mana, not damage, veyr very different sets KEK

[11:19:54] Gunznrocketz: Tuckge
[11:19:56] Reticent_88: Most classes prefer double-stat for that reason. Hunter is possibly the only one who would still prefer pure Agi, it's just such an amazing stat

[11:20:06] Sandap: rfr0zen well he's talking leveling specifically, and spirit is the best leveling stat. mana regen + health regen = less downtime. dps doesnt matter if youre always stopping.

[11:22:46] dubie6: my memory on when i was hunter main when it came from stat priorities it was in order of prio=agi,int,spirit,stam. stam was the least important but that was softcore. obviously some fights matters and you changed around that.

[11:25:15] Tidings: @Reticent_88 You kill faster using skills, of course hunter can kill with autos but if he can use skills and not rest is better, and stamina isn't neeeded if he doesn't get hit, thats the point that he is trying to explain
[11:25:17] Alert339: @ceolinrob because this game is basically a spreadsheet. i suppose people think differently, but all this spirit and bis lists conversation seems kinda dumb for me
