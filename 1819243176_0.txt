[0:18:09] Sleepylol93: Blizzard will be adding a new duel mechanic, where players can choose to duel to the death, if they so desire. /makgora is the command
[0:18:29] a_noob_is__: They’re going to have duel to the death
[0:18:30] Blaster: is it out yet ? cause i checked and i cant find the addon for retail

[0:21:09] Code_nameX: @swifty hope it is better place for you and your family,but i really liked that setup
[0:21:16] Spart4nm4n: @Swifty hows the puppy doing?

[0:21:31] fourseti1234: which is very little
[0:21:48] Triple_AK_ron: Have you died before on another hardcore character?

[0:22:22] Ava52: i forgot the command
[0:22:24] Ava52: lol
[0:22:33] Knups: The ZoneMan Challenge is a supplementary ruleset that can be played in addition to however you're already playing Classic WoW (hardcore, softcore, etc.) Level professions, gain points, use the points to unlock zones in order to progress through the game. As this is an entirely optional, for fun game mode, there is no anti-cheat protection and it is entirely possible to soft lock your run if you're making poor zone purchases. Don't cheat, don't be dumb! Goodluck!

[0:28:25] zaleco: how would pvp work on hc?
[0:28:26] TCP_Citizn: I think death shouldn't matter inside of BGs
[0:28:30] Blaster: we have to all create an alliance
[0:28:33] CriticalDroog: yes
[0:28:40] Blaster: and raid the horde empty out their cities
[0:28:42] CriticalDroog: work on your class

[0:28:46] zaleco: You cant do pvp on hc
[0:28:47] Galdrena: no, horde not alliance :p
[0:28:57] PaEu: Why? you will be bored of the class before it launches
[0:28:58] CriticalDroog: rogue.....
[0:28:58] Blaster: rogue pvp
[0:28:58] a_noob_is__: Rogue
[0:29:01] sgten1987: rogue
[0:29:02] Blaster: ofcourse
[0:29:04] TCP_Citizn: @zaleco that's only with the addon
[0:29:05] Pstalance: Rogue
[0:29:14] CriticalDroog: make a new rogue and perfect your new class
[0:29:15] longbeach562: I don't think they're going to have Battlegrounds
[0:29:22] fourseti1234: druids are lik eunkillable 1v1
[0:29:22] Gendread77: you got vanish as rogue
[0:29:26] PaEu: People arent gonna PvP on HC
[0:29:33] AllenzoTV: feral is good in pvp
[0:29:39] a_noob_is__: No feral isn’t even close to sub rogue
[0:29:57] zaleco: lol why would anyone do battle grounds when only one person comes out of itlololol
[0:30:04] AllenzoTV: U ever watch sodapoppin duel? skillcap is pretty high to
[0:30:12] fourseti1234: feral druid will win
[0:30:18] BDave: only class that druid destroys is mage when compared to rogue :)
[0:30:35] GarSeason: For Druid pvp in vanilla, you go resto so you can get NS and swiftmend
[0:30:39] AllenzoTV: u can vanish vs a drud
[0:30:42] fourseti1234: moonfire or fairyfire and rogue is done lol
[0:30:50] AllenzoTV: u cant vanish vs a druid*
[0:31:07] TCP_Citizn: You can /afk in Battlegrounds to leave instantly I'm pretty sure
[0:31:37] xxwheybolicxx92: so what was the news? we can play hardcore on any servers or they releasing hardcore on retail wow.?
[0:31:37] SithLordBob: you should host the mok'gora duel to the death tournament for all the streamers
[0:31:46] SithLordBob: once everyone is lvl60
[0:32:11] Arkitek: at what level?
[0:32:13] BigDestiny169: druid with talents
[0:32:23] CriticalDroog: with or without sprint?
[0:32:28] marcoganja13: druid
[0:32:30] raver31: the rogue early lvl is walking speed
[0:32:32] BigDestiny169: 15% at 1/2 talents
[0:32:32] barlos124: 30
[0:32:32] longbeach562: I don't think we're going to have battlegrounds he said the people he ssaid going to be like 1v1 /Mak'gora
[0:32:33] SithLordBob: theyre releasing their own blizzard official hardcore servers @xxwheybolicxx92
[0:32:36] l4t33d: druid with talents
[0:32:37] CriticalDroog: doesnt rogue get a stealth speed buff
[0:32:43] BigDestiny169: plus the additional travel form and healing
[0:32:43] PaEu: why are you thinking about getting rank 14 on HC? people arent gonna PvP
[0:32:45] SilkeySmooth: what do you think about the hardcore announcement?
[0:32:48] fourseti1234: well druids in cat form get a speed boost outdoors
[0:32:53] fourseti1234: that works in stealth
[0:32:54] Grael1256: Rogue gets stealh movment stealh talents too i believe
[0:32:56] Krajn: but you can put points in rogues stealth for speed?
[0:33:00] GarSeason: If you get 2/2 Feline swiftness that 30% movement speed, but ONLY outdoors. You have Dash too tho
[0:33:00] Grael1256: but I believe they have to sac talents to get it
[0:33:02] barlos124: Good rogues vanish for improved stealth
[0:33:11] HytBrooke: in the Sub tree
[0:33:16] xxwheybolicxx92: @SithLordBob ohh snap thank you. so on retail servers or classic servers?
[0:33:18] l4t33d: sub rogue has talents I believe for it
[0:33:19] Grael1256: Rogue
[0:33:23] HytBrooke: something like 15% movement speed
[0:33:25] SilkeySmooth: they do they dotn waste talents for speed
[0:33:26] SithLordBob: theyre adding duels to the death
[0:33:28] raver31: you have to talent into faster rogue stealth
[0:33:28] fourseti1234: @barlos124 cant with fairyfire on them
[0:33:36] SithLordBob: classic vanilla @xxwheybolicxx92
[0:33:42] barlos124: He will see them before the druid sees
[0:33:49] Grael1256: Yeah, i think they get a movement tallents ( rogue ) but they might have to sac some needed talents for it.
[0:33:55] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:33:56] xxwheybolicxx92: @SithLordBob thanks
[0:33:56] barlos124: It would be the opener
[0:33:57] l4t33d: iirc it is 15% or something
[0:34:03] longbeach562: Devs said pvp going be like Mak'gora style 1v1 nothing about battlegrounds
[0:34:05] fourseti1234: @barlos124 ur talking WASTE a vanish for a opener? lol no
[0:34:08] darkvsgrim: rogues do have camouflage, 15% movements speed passive
[0:34:19] SilkeySmooth: rogue speed is in the talent tree most rogues avoid
[0:34:27] darkvsgrim: in stealth ofc
[0:34:28] PaEu: Swifty people arent gonna do BGS on HC
[0:34:30] Aldever13: @Swifty, you should make a video with peanut talking about HC
[0:34:34] darkvsgrim: talents in sub
[0:34:37] barlos124: @fourseti1234 yes and so does sarthe a rank1 rogue
[0:34:46] CriticalDroog: its in sub for rogue
[0:34:49] BigDestiny169: druids get the 15% to cat form but there are 2 points that can go into it
[0:34:52] longbeach562: No
[0:35:00] HeeJaw: Back in the days i played affliction warlock pvp. I loved to put on curse of agony (40yard) on warriors. Warriors could not charge if they were in combat :D
[0:35:00] TCP_Citizn: BGs are my main concern going into HC right now
[0:35:03] longbeach562: Hardcore will be in his own server
[0:35:11] SilkeySmooth: you have to make it to 60 with no appeals
[0:35:14] fourseti1234: @barlos124  maybe depending on match up. but no just no
[0:35:15] CriticalDroog: need 5 points in sub to select it
[0:35:18] polado9: @swifty where can i claim the hipo fly mount?
[0:35:23] l4t33d: 10 points in sub tree gets you the 15% stealth move boost
[0:35:25] PaEu: I dont think people are gonna play on the other servers when HC is out
[0:35:46] SilkeySmooth: yes passvie
[0:35:48] CriticalDroog: forever
[0:35:49] darkvsgrim: passive forever
[0:35:51] longbeach562: Only in steal
[0:35:54] TCP_Citizn: @PaEu a ton of ppl play on them outside of HC
[0:35:55] pindog123: passive forever
[0:35:58] l4t33d: passive
[0:36:02] Grael1256: plus you can stun lock as a rogue much better
[0:36:04] darkvsgrim: Increases your speed while stealthed by 3% and reduces the cooldown of your Stealth ability by 1 sec.
[0:36:04] CriticalDroog: sub
[0:36:06] SilkeySmooth: subletty
[0:36:08] Krajn: sub
[0:36:08] longbeach562: Sub
[0:36:09] CriticalDroog: lvl 2
[0:36:11] HytBrooke: Sub
[0:36:15] HytBrooke: second row
[0:36:25] BigDestiny169: look at feral druid
[0:36:25] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:36:29] l4t33d: tier 2 talent sub tree far right
[0:36:33] GarSeason: I think they will prolly handle HC servers like an RP server, completely seperate.
[0:36:40] longbeach562: Sub tree in classic make rogue feel like retail
[0:36:40] CriticalDroog: and then hit sprint on top of that
[0:36:42] AdleR_82: Helo Swifty
[0:36:49] l4t33d: 10 seconds
[0:36:52] TCP_Citizn: @GarHeal I think so and hope so
[0:37:01] HytBrooke: was 10 secs in classic? but with talent its 5
[0:37:01] SilkeySmooth: there will be no bgs on hardcore
[0:37:03] longbeach562: I still don't think there's going to be battlegrounds and hardcore server
[0:37:08] swiftyhealer: @swifty can you please link the druid guide in discord
[0:37:19] TCP_Citizn: @SilkeySmooth Why not?
[0:37:35] BigDestiny169: thats PHAT
[0:37:38] CriticalDroog: outdoors tho
[0:37:39] Teagens: CLASSIC!?
[0:37:44] deeepx1: both i think
[0:37:45] longbeach562: The only PVP he mentioned was Mak'gora style 1v1 duel till death
[0:37:51] l4t33d: feral tier 3 far left - move speed which does work in stealth
[0:37:53] SilkeySmooth: @TCP_Citizn die instant death no appeals no oen will queue
[0:37:53] HeeJaw: Definitely faster in stealth and unstealth
[0:38:00] CriticalDroog: you'll be dead by rank 7
[0:38:02] BigDestiny169: all of the BG is outdoors for the most part
[0:38:03] CriticalDroog: jk
[0:38:25] SilkeySmooth: go rogue
[0:38:34] whitepawz: You’ll die as Feral
[0:38:34] TCP_Citizn: @SilkeySmooth It's not on the realm. It's entirely possible that we can res inside BGs
[0:38:41] biozal: I've got a druid it's slow
[0:38:56] l4t33d: Stealth reduces speed by % the talent inceases base sped. you have to multiply. I think it comes out to even with rogue.
[0:38:58] pindog123: it doesnt work for stealth
[0:38:59] whitepawz: It worked fine back in Vanilla
[0:39:02] BigDestiny169: i cant imagine it doesnt work in stealth
[0:39:09] odem___: 30% only unstealth work
[0:39:21] fourseti1234: ya i tworked in vanilla
[0:39:23] fourseti1234: it
[0:39:24] SilkeySmooth: @TCP_Citizn blizzard hasnt said anthing about that so dont assume yet
[0:39:25] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:39:30] TheMostHumbleManHere: I feel that talent is pretty fine, at least 1 point
[0:39:40] BigDestiny169: druid prob still the safer option
[0:39:42] HytBrooke: play the druid man
[0:39:43] Teagens: So play a Druid
[0:39:44] longbeach562: What makes you think there's going to be battlegrounds
[0:39:46] Teagens: But also
[0:39:50] Teagens: CLASSIC!?
[0:39:51] PicklesLordOfTheJar: If you enjoy druid then why not play it?
[0:39:52] TheMostHumbleManHere: Do it
[0:39:53] HytBrooke: your the one having to sink time into it
[0:39:53] biozal: play what ever you want, it will be entertaining no matter what
[0:39:55] snipenright: outdoors it works for stealth
[0:40:00] Galdrena: Blaster you still here?
[0:40:18] SilkeySmooth: everyone will be a rogue in hardcore bgs
[0:40:28] Teagens: Do NOT go into the Barrens. Do ALL the Starting Zones and their quests
[0:40:29] CriticalDroog: practice makes perfect
[0:40:33] xxwheybolicxx92: do it
[0:40:39] longbeach562: They never announced battlegrounds where you guys getting this from
[0:40:41] TCP_Citizn: @SilkeySmooth I'm not assuming either. I do however assume that they will not disable BGs because they said that they don't want to limit what players can or cannot do. They said they will disable resurrections on the realm
[0:40:44] Teagens: What did Blizzard Announce?
[0:40:51] Galdrena: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/hardcore-and-next-season-announcement-wow-classic-332982
[0:41:00] Galdrena: @Teagens ^
[0:41:05] zanleren1997: How do you sign up for the Hardcore challenge atm?
[0:41:05] Knups: @longbeach562 why would they not have bgs? it would be more work for them to take them out
[0:41:12] longbeach562: He said 1v1 Mak'gora style
[0:41:16] SilkeySmooth: @Teagens hardcore server
[0:41:28] Teagens: o.O
[0:41:33] SilkeySmooth: there may not be bgs for all we know
[0:41:35] clav__: From the say streamers are talking about it, it already sounds like a disaster. sumDuck

[0:42:42] darkvsgrim: No, he said specifically that hardcore is something different to the new season of mastery whatever they will call it
[0:42:44] SilkeySmooth: they arnt calling is som2 because som got a bad rap
[0:42:48] ttvturdle: one day ill have more then 3 viewer i gotta believe :)
[0:42:56] Blaster: i am sorry i havent can u relink it please @Galdrena

[0:54:13] bythelightx: druid better leveling for sure
[0:54:13] whitepawz: Do you expect ppl to enter BGs on their lvl 60 to die permanently? That sounds completely mental
[0:54:17] BigDestiny169: druid with the survivabiliy
[0:54:20] Garciamkg17: Druid is the way to go for sure.
[0:54:26] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!

[0:54:48] BigDestiny169: stream snipers in your bg tho lol
[0:54:51] GhostyGustav: Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[0:54:54] FartMasterFlexx: you think stream snipers are bad now tho
[0:54:56] HeylenR: and then you die in your first encounter and have to go agane
[0:54:57] GarSeason: Sadly you would prolly be sniped in stealth...
[0:55:04] Skycoh: druid is so slow and boring until like level 30, plus you're always mana starved trying to survive.

[1:18:30] angelbutt3: Yes
[1:18:34] magerazor: problem with rogue, is their Stealth ability, very very slow.
[1:18:36] Knaxxis: 21/8/22 is still better
[1:18:37] mick_myage: @dysphia makgora
[1:18:41] Dig_Playz: Is the goal of HC to get to 60 or if you die at 60 do you still delete?
[1:18:43] Keefer_710: HypeLUL HypeLUL
[1:18:48] hexdoktori: its /makgora
[1:19:05] Frostlighit: @HoteiGoom buuut 21-8-22 one hit clothies :)
[1:19:21] TCP_Citizn: They said resurrections are disabled on the realm, however Battlegrounds to my knowledge are not on the realm
[1:19:21] Dig_Playz: Doing /makgora for raid gear would be a funny way to dish out loot
[1:19:32] barlos124: Goodl uck on the rogue. Ur gonna be suprised how hard they pump
[1:19:34] thedonmac: everyone would just hide in bgs..stupid
[1:19:48] TheFPSDad: They are gonna do death duels why would they remove it from BGS
[1:19:58] DickyJHawl: could you not just get in groups and trade wins?
[1:20:15] Dig_Playz: No i mean like 2 rogues both want a piece of gear from the raid. So they /makgora to see who gets it for example
[1:20:24] angelbutt3: Got to use subtly in this fight
[1:20:25] coconust1: It's been done before on few pservers
[1:20:34] Knups: we know blizzard. they are just going to remove ress and let the rest go. yes bg's, yes dungeons, yes ah. yes everyone is going to hide in dungeons and bgs
[1:20:37] angelbutt3: Go fighting win!
[1:20:53] HoteiGoom: @HoteiGoom yes, every 3 min... and cold blood... not really good in my opinion. (i do not play dagger) and with my spec, you can farm ez pvp, have lots of bleeding and nice hit.
[1:21:12] Dig_Playz: Yeah true you're not wrong
[1:21:41] TCP_Citizn: lol

[1:28:48] d4rkc00der: on other side of church
[1:28:53] shaggy462: you'll need to do a rogue quest for the poison

[1:29:28] Vividgamers: Nope
[1:29:28] fourseti1234: then why do hc

[1:29:33] shaggy462: sure if you have the money for it
[1:29:35] Vividgamers: Lol
[1:29:42] nashonatorrr: you need cooking for tea and herb to get the Swiftthistle. Poisons you learn. Vendor has mats for your poisons
[1:29:43] Faroe_Man: they should have a one character livmit on the hardcore servers
[1:29:46] TheMostHumbleManHere: I can't understand the hype for such a lazy job. 2 weeks for deleting resurrections
[1:29:47] neevir: Top easy
[1:29:49] TheMostHumbleManHere: 2 months I mean
[1:29:50] coconust1: The only valid reason for having no trade insee is there will be no bots

[1:30:16] Faroe_Man: one character means no trading to your other toons
[1:30:18] Vividgamers: Blind
[1:30:18] shaggy462: i dont think people want people to farm gold on their higher level character and send it all to a lower level character, makes the game almost trivial
[1:30:20] Execrable1: isn't the entire point of this hardcore thing to be a challenge and NOT make things easy?
[1:30:21] DLCKDANN69: back to the hc PogChamp
[1:30:57] TheMostHumbleManHere: especialy for gold sellers
[1:30:57] Arkitek: not for hardcore, the whole points doing it on your own

[1:31:01] angelbutt3: Wow hardcore challenge
[1:31:03] darmorlol: You can at 60
[1:31:04] shaggy462: trading is good, the AH is good, i just think sending lots of gold from 1 char to another of your chars may be a bad thing, make it too easy
[1:31:16] Vividgamers: FYI. Rogues need fade leaf for blind.
[1:31:21] Zalazane: i mean you can level blacksmithing for the rods and dip it later for enchanting
[1:31:23] Misterbaits: if u have the hardcore addon do u still need to record ur hardcore run?
[1:31:24] darmorlol: You can raid and stuff at 60 HC
[1:31:25] DLCKDANN69: right
[1:31:35] Zalazane: Hardcore isnt a speed race

[1:32:40] Arkitek: gave u a lv 1 and 5 wand.. thats called classic. LuL
[1:32:42] shaggy462: poison vendors provide all rogue reagents and poison crafting materials, you don't need herbalism
