[1:52:27] cmf_westers: it's finally time!
[1:52:48] Keyostew: @sudd7 that might be due to things they classify as runes, such as AoE priest buffs or totems

[1:53:00] Keyostew: but i figured theyd let mages ahve aoe arcane int
[1:53:35] sudd7: @Keyostew i thought so too, but for mage i believe it is because of the to spellfire and frostfire bolts. but yea, def could be that
[1:53:43] sudd7: two*
[1:53:46] Bennska: i wonder how demonic sacrifice VW will work with metamorphosis, might be a super chunky build
