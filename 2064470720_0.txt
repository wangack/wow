[0:37:05] Yuriosh: have u seen the palumor video with the step kick outlaw hook combo macro?
[0:37:06] magnusz: did they let u use the stoplight WA on the main stage
[0:37:08] Esotraz: U sure hes not just max ranging and spamming The Button?
[0:37:15] realdreadx: Song?
[0:37:17] thec4ptn: @magnusz have you ever played AWC with Crusader on your team?
[0:37:18] sarent02: hating on jaime yet again u guys just cant see his greatness
[0:37:27] fedayn72roma: You have these unknown russians at the top, they would even stomp na
[0:37:28] asdkl2312k3o: I actually thought jaime was 5head with thhat feral knock. Moving away and spamming it for it to trigger when in range in leap
[0:37:30] magnusz: yea HAHAHAHA
[0:37:34] vothros: @Whaazz there is a setting i think where your spell goes off on key release rather than key press, meaning faster information  from you to the server, maybe thats what jaime uses?
[0:37:36] itsmiraix: WhaazzRet when?
[0:38:06] peestii: @magnusz people say they saw him plugging some usb, for mouse drivers he said
[0:38:07] Esotraz: Ye it would be 5head if he was actually out of range in The clips

[0:39:01] algebraist97: So for them to determine it, they'd need to use invasive measures that would violate privacy?

[0:39:06] stillthechamp: but how tf does he do that then

[0:39:24] pmakewow: lets say you are spinbotting in a cs lan and its undetectable then its allowed or
[0:39:27] waitimdesyncd: they need to rewrite the ToS to basically be a rootkit kind of anti cheat  and that would kill wow
[0:39:29] Midsommar: jaime playing from the presidents office, so they're not allowed to check him.
[0:39:32] Yuriosh: @Whaazz  have u seen the palumor video with the step kick outlaw hook combo macro?
[0:39:40] Matzefyr: Fr though, this game is 20 years old and people still crying about people using bots? I use bots because I like playing the game and it makes it easie for me. It doesn't hurt anyone else, so how about you guys stop crying ?
[0:39:48] larine1: @magnusz i mean how will you win without spamming spells before starting arena

[1:18:06] magnusz: lets get infy, mvq, and whaazz in cord to debate this topic
[1:18:09] magnusz: ill moderate
[1:18:14] iamreallyafan: that ebolt guy, who is he?
[1:18:16] infernion: I mean both the locks of mine are 2940+ MMR but what's the point of queuing when the game kinda sucks and you just push last week anyway for r1 cuz nothing else matters till then
[1:18:20] Braunijs: why would people who have 10 r1s care about camping rating
[1:18:22] Braunijs: i dont get it
[1:18:29] infernion: @magnusz HAHAHAHA

[1:22:53] Matzefyr: main problem is there is nothing for us average players. Make the glad mount 100 games above 1800, so us average players has something to play for too
[1:23:07] camgirlxo: @Matzefyr 10/10 troll
[1:23:09] Esotraz: @Matzefyr agreed
[1:23:14] DipdabTwitch: It's a double edged sword, you inflate the mmr and you do spread the player base thinner across the ratings, but if you don't do it people aren't encouraged to aim for stuff like 2.4k as it's unachieveable
[1:23:16] uninspire: idk why glad mount isnt granted @ 1600 tbh
[1:23:18] aoespawn: @matzefyr not bad idea
[1:23:20] AzeidaWoW: @Matzefyr ROFL

[1:28:13] AzeidaWoW: :3
[1:28:14] mvqq: Reason why 2800+ people can't get pops is because those SAME PEOPLE who are 2800+ play alts of the same class. Then, those SAME PEOPLE will go to twitter and say "buff mmr". It's so fried.
[1:28:16] Esotraz: i mean he is the highest rated 2v2 player of all time @AzeidaWoW

[1:31:26] infernion: There's barely any 2.5 teams on your reflex tho? Only high 2.5 like 2580 etc

[1:34:00] Xiunitv: mvq remember when we would....nvm
[1:34:00] Smexxin: yeah its rough, mmr naturally going up is correlated to participation and all the fotm players making alts/dh are soaking up the mmr
[1:34:03] gone_wickedtv: but not to fun

[1:34:25] DipdabTwitch: I remember when top pvpers only wanted the 1% to get Gladiator, now they want to hand it out to get people to play
[1:34:37] mvqq: I know what you're saying w people logging alts bcus their main gets too high but this is unironically THE issue - wouldn't you think that if everyone just spam q'd their main that MMR would inflate naturally?
[1:34:39] Gingtko: @Smexxin maybe rating decay is a good option? to force players play on mains?
[1:34:45] JulianJimenez13: im tryong to push high ello but i play at 1900 cause im trash :D
[1:34:53] mogreene: Whaaz you are wrong! We dont need mmr fix! We need to Gladiator is 1600 cr and we all happy))
[1:35:08] thetractorkid: @mvqq no bc not enough total players queueing
[1:35:39] Smexxin: yeah for sure, its a lot more complicated than it appears
[1:35:42] raztvx: u cant leave it up to players to fix the game tho, blizzard obviously has to do something @mvqq
[1:35:54] aoespawn: lol 2.1 players are destined not to have the add ons and are less likely to track enemy cds :) cuz that’s cheating
[1:35:58] AzeidaWoW: Yes, it's not just an arificial mmr inflation issue though, gameplay is spikey, healers dont enjoy playing = less players. But adding some mmr right now would make pvp a lot healthier, more spacing between players, allowing good players to climb higher

[1:36:32] mvqq: I'm just trying to state the issue, the solution isn't a player thing - You could for instance make high mmr players fight low mmr players faster, instead of after 10-20 minutes.
[1:36:41] infernion: We all agree MMR needs to get fixed, I just don't see the issue with Mvqs example of queue session here.. Like that was not due to low MMR I feel? Felt like normal range of teams to face if ~2.6-2.650 yourself
[1:36:47] Xiunitv: ozzdagreat would
[1:36:52] sistahfistah1: if they nerfed dh maybe more people would que :)
[1:37:05] peestii: your hpally has feet up 100%
[1:37:16] thetractorkid: the solution is making players who arent queueing now want to queue, need more rewards for getting 2100 and stuff the PvE people can work for in 1 season
[1:37:24] amnetv: @mvqq ye so incentivize even less low rated people to que. this is a garbage take
[1:37:27] thetractorkid: then more ppl queue and rating inflates
[1:37:32] egrttv: @sistahfistah1 dont think Dhs are the issue here mate
[1:37:38] l3fty123: ppl need to accept that this game is dead
[1:37:54] sistahfistah1: @sistahfistah1 dh is 100% the root of all issues with mmr :)
[1:37:57] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Whaazz
[1:37:58] flopxz111: true game is just dead not enough players play it
[1:38:11] mvqq: All the MMR issues are rooted in game being dead, unironically
[1:38:12] JulianJimenez13: @l3fty123 ??? xd
[1:38:18] luckyirl123: @sistahfistah1 i def dont que because of this reason
[1:38:49] amnetv: @mvqq I mean sure, that`s 100% true. I found some stats from WoD season 3, Right now there are 3-4 times less players playing
[1:38:55] Raikubest: Ofc 100000%
[1:38:55] l3fty123: @JulianJimenez13 its not because of mmr or dh its because nobody want to play it
[1:39:01] Raikubest: Ofc
[1:39:01] KingBurn87: yeah 100 %
[1:39:06] thetractorkid: PvE isnt dead, make the pve people WANT to queue
[1:39:07] Raikubest: if they buff mmr by 400 everyone will play
[1:39:08] bobthegoblin_: I havent Qed 1 game of 3s this expac
[1:39:09] Roguemania92: i agree mmr needs a buff
[1:39:09] bobthegoblin_: only solo
[1:39:11] iamreallyafan: HAHAHAHAHAHA
[1:39:14] Anabolixtv: People want to play, the mmr just de-incentivises ppl
[1:39:14] peestii: KEKW
[1:39:15] Lordshaftington: R1 range is has been stuck under 2.7 for weeks, meaning the rating gap between duelist and elite is actually smaller than elite to R1. Makes no sense for the players that don't get glad for free but want to earn it against similar players.
[1:39:21] nypoww: i'm just waiting for blizzard to increase mmr to get rewards
[1:39:22] Matzefyr: Put Gladiator on the store for a 100 dollars. The players that are good enough can grind it from playing arena, and the people with jobs like myself, can buy it. Everyone is happy.
[1:39:23] Esotraz: i rather have people be able to get the 3.4 + again aslong as people fucking q
[1:39:23] HRZNx: if they buff MMR there will be a short-term influx but the same situation will happen again just with bigger numbers
[1:39:24] infernion: It's like a self fulfilling prophecy, game is "dead" cuz the MMR is so bad -> People stop -> MMR gets worse -> More people stop -> Gg
[1:39:27] camgirlxo: always picking on the old man kekw
[1:39:31] itsQQgaming: as someone that does rated for the 1800 mog im not pushing till its buffed.
[1:39:31] grris: @peestii still need ppl for AB?
[1:39:37] krrauly: a lot of players banned due to the chat issue ... i am facing so many reports for no reason at all. Some times ppl report u just coz u ask them to focus on purg or kick ... boom and i see report after i ask it )
[1:39:37] hrdstylerz: @infernion there
[1:39:41] dankgamer97: Raiku getting shots left and right Sadge
[1:39:41] iamreallyafan: @infernion as easy as that
[1:39:42] Raikubest: If it was HUGE mmr inflation
[1:39:47] Raikubest: the activity would increase
[1:39:49] bobthegoblin_: there is no reason for glad level ppl to Q 3s this expac
[1:39:49] Xiunitv: this convo is becoming to productive. can we go back to shitposting?
[1:39:51] Raikubest: SO MUCH
[1:39:52] camgirlxo: yeah i get it,its banter
[1:39:56] amnetv: @infernion at this point, we should just gray out the PvP tab I feel like
[1:40:00] DCBen: make more rewards
[1:40:05] vothros: if you have to play vs r1 players to get glad then cba why bother thats what most ppl think
[1:40:05] DCBen: from 2400->3000
[1:40:06] fuseton: i mean last time they inflated ladder there was x5 times more qs @Whaazz ofc they should do it , i legit think there is some1 sitting there runining pvp on purpose by not inflating mmr
[1:40:08] AzeidaWoW: What's complicated?? 1. Add more rewards to all brackets. 2. Add artificial mmr. 3. make glad % based. 4. Nerf CD oriented gameplay, and buff sustain abilities, so minor outplays become more important, and the game becomes less scripted. (more similar to mop). 5. Remove some mobility cd's, so abilities like wild charge ACTUALLY MATTERS, like mop..
[1:40:10] iamreallyafan: @Whaazz mdi is right around the corner, gues we watching that and learn pve now
[1:40:13] Anabolixtv: Or bring back % glad cutoff?
[1:40:17] amnetv: @Raikubest ye, too bad blizz injected 100 mmr 3 months ago and that was it
[1:40:25] l3fty123: @Raikubest why would it increase the same ppl are on the top of the ladder for years xD
[1:40:26] sarent02: raiku isnt even a sub
[1:40:30] Lordshaftington: Duelist to Elite is 300 CR, but elite to R1 is less than 300 CR. Make it make sense
[1:40:30] sarent02: L friend
[1:40:44] Sameh5554: no dont go deaf
[1:40:45] eacherro: It feels there is so many people that have no brain here... People only play WoW pvp with the goal of reaching glad some day... If there are pro players on 2400, you will never have queues coz it is not worth their time... If you stretch the MMR, prost will be 3k and casuals will fight for gladiator titles... it is not so hard to understand
[1:40:46] mogreene: shadowland S2 was good)))
[1:40:47] Sameh5554: Pepega
[1:40:55] sarent02: It feels there is so many people that have no brain here... People only play WoW pvp with the goal of reaching glad some day...

[1:41:08] Xiunitv: @mogreene oh shadowlands, back when i was somewhat mentally sane
[1:41:12] Xiunitv: OH THE DAYS
[1:41:12] ExoliaTV: make mmr great again whaazzSmash
[1:41:15] uninspire: not sure what you mean, blizzard already inflated MMR? They already have demon hunters???
[1:41:15] mvqq: ofc but let's make an imaginary scenario where there's 4 teams that play right, 1 team at 2.3, 2.5, 2.7 and 2.9. These teams sit 10 min qs to fight each other. Now let's say MMR gets inflated, so now there's 1 team at 2.5, 2.7, 2.9 and 3.1. NOTHING changed except everyones rating went up 200. This is good, right? But let's say another team starts qin, and they're 2.1. Who do they fight? No one.
[1:41:21] grris: @Xiunitv wait you got worse? oh my
[1:41:24] Rattkjelkee: Rattkjelkee subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 76 months, currently on a 76 month streak! poggers
[1:41:29] Xiunitv: @grris LOL
[1:41:47] Xarotic: @mvqq but it makes more ppl q
[1:41:56] KingBurn87: first world problems Kappa
[1:42:10] Rewenzz: i think there is alot more 2.1 teams queing tho? @mvqq
[1:42:18] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Whaazz
[1:42:24] vothros: @mvqq more people are motivated to play though so now instead of 1k people playing its 2k so more queues
[1:42:27] lucksh20: @Xarotic excatly, so there will be ppl at 2.1
[1:42:27] Moobot: https://www.twitch.tv/whaazz/clip/JazzyUnusualJalapenoEagleEye-idkWIYFZo54OaUnC
[1:42:31] aoespawn: lol 😂 bring back the malidict
[1:42:32] bobthegoblin_: @mvqq thats terrible logic cause a lot of ppl dont bother playing 3s if they were glad previous expansions cause its impossible to get now
[1:42:48] grris: bring back 10sec holy stun 😂
[1:42:55] thetractorkid: mvqq thinks playerbase total wont change pepega
[1:43:08] strengthofathousndmen: @mvqq that would also mean you start queuing into r1 players a bit higher then 2.3
[1:43:11] Xiunitv: @thetractorkid Thats my husband ur talking about
[1:43:13] thetractorkid: make the PvE people queue, 3x influx to playerbase and game is fixed. 2.1 players get boosted to 2.4
[1:43:17] eacherro: @mvqq with your mentality you will be sitting no queues in 2030 also coz  you wont "make" new good players, since 99% of WoW pvp players are casuals and they wont ever queue to pro players that do this game as job... If you let people queue, fight for gladiator title, there might be much more people in future having the motivation to get better and simply push even pros...
[1:43:24] vothros: they should bump mmr by like 200 straight away then see how that goes and slowly go from there
[1:43:35] AzeidaWoW: So many opinions in here, yet there's only 1 right answer scientifically... isn't that interesting
[1:43:44] AzeidaWoW: Almost as if confirmation bias exists or something
[1:43:58] thetractorkid: my 3s team is hardstuck 2k against r1 players on alts, so demoralizing to want to play bc 2.4 is unobtainable for us
[1:44:04] maybethistimepls: damn thats a good ele
[1:44:09] amnetv: @vothros They should deflate it so only R1 and Pros gets the Elite set. make R1 cutoff 1800
[1:44:13] hrdstylerz: @vothros nope, they need to fix the matchmaking and elo algorithms otherwise it just continues the same way, but with +200 rating
[1:44:14] amtrash112: nerf freedom
[1:44:16] camgirlxo: ele eating good tonight with all inc mmr
[1:44:18] jaime: at the end of the day it doesn't really matter where the issue is (player made or systemic), blizzard should just curate the ladder and artifically fix the issue to increase the unacceptably low participation
[1:44:20] HaasFast: @thetractorkid ur not gna be hardstuck 2k from r1 players sorry to say
[1:44:21] Withor12: the real answer to fix the issue: get more people playing pvp lmaooo
[1:44:29] Jkrx: @AzeidaWoW 2Head take, most of the time there's many solutions to a problem, not just one
[1:44:32] mvqq: @jaime agreed
[1:44:47] DOGGFOOD69: your healer never press aura mastery
[1:44:55] thetractorkid: @HaasFast we checkpvp, every team has r1 exp people. its crazy. obviously we could play better but still it sucks playing against such good players at such low rating
[1:44:59] grris: fix ladder by being botters
[1:45:04] jaime: u just pump mmr into the game
[1:45:07] jaime: simple
[1:45:08] jaime: lol
[1:45:13] hrdstylerz: @jaime some issues are easier to fix than others, i think it's crucial where the issue lies, otherwise you cannot fix the root problem
[1:45:14] grris: banning*
[1:45:25] Raikubest: ofc but this was always the problem right, mvq is probably right the mmr system was always like for x amount of new players playing the mmr will go up by like 1 mmr, which is 2 little but if mmr got increased by 400 tomorrow, people would que up
[1:45:34] infernion: https://imgur.com/a/1axX4jP Here's the actual Reflex in question. I don't think this is due to low mmr, seems to face equal matched teams entire session. MMR just needs a massive injection
[1:45:36] hrdstylerz: adding mmr is just a temporary fix
[1:45:47] jaime: just dynamically adjust the mmr increase per week on past week participation
[1:45:53] jaime: would take one person maybe an hour a week
[1:45:56] thetractorkid: @hrdstylerz no bc it will make the rewards obtainable for players who arent currently participating in the ladder at all
[1:45:57] jaime: to make that call
[1:45:58] unsteddy: why don't all the mains just agree to queue for a few hours every night?
[1:45:59] Edzea: low participation because MMR is so deflated, casual players just CBA playing with multiglad at 1.8-2k MMR
[1:46:04] uninspire: @jaime dont hate this idea actually
[1:46:18] DayDrinkin: @unsteddy shouldnt be the players responsibility to fix the games issues lol
[1:46:18] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:46:20] shredder1111: they should unironically inject 1k average mmr into the system, who cares if everyone gets a glad mount the qs would be popping
[1:46:25] sarent02: is he jaime???
[1:46:25] Nab1337: it would be pointless playing till end of season in that case right ?
[1:46:26] magnusz: its jaime
[1:46:30] sarent02: JAJA
[1:46:32] eacherro: People will queue up at point, where casuals has chance to reaching glad.. till that, there will be no queues at all...
[1:46:35] jaime: im typing and playing same time
[1:46:39] Raikubest: The ele is pokemons
[1:46:39] grris: what if its a pro player and a bot
[1:46:44] magnusz: yea try charging him and see how fast he knocks u
[1:46:45] worthtv: he has 3,3 exp
[1:46:46] uninspire: jaime can play without his keyboard hes at that level
[1:46:47] infernion: @jaime Not surprised you can do that tbh
[1:46:48] sarent02: @jaime THATS WHY U ARE MY GOAT
[1:46:49] mogreene: it's Zeepeye
[1:46:49] Xiunitv: blizzcon champion going 1-5 in solo shuffle. Crazy how many "r1" players get exposed in a fair enviornment. Me? I got r1 on bm hunter on day 3, show i was being held back by teammates.
[1:46:49] Matzefyr: why not just remove rating all together and just have a hidden mmr system? players with high rating tend to have nasty egos. And just because u have high rating doesn't make u any good at the game. I do +24+ keys easily, yet im 1600 in arena. Doesnt make me any worse than a 2.4k player for example.
[1:46:51] magnusz: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[1:46:55] amnetv: @infernion KEKW
[1:47:10] unsteddy: @DayDrinkin kind of cope though, if blizzard wont fix it then do it yourself. Get a discord and get all the 2.7+ players to organize a queue time, but they wont
[1:47:10] joliestarr: @Matzefyr actually it does
[1:47:13] realdreadx: @Matzefyr actually it does make u good at the game and PVE is way easier
[1:47:15] hercybrah: KEKW

[1:47:31] shredder1111: @Matzefyr 1.6k players are worse than 2.4k players in arena though LUL
[1:47:34] iamreallyafan: CLIP IT
[1:47:36] blinkers89: i see the whole problem r1 players/people who play this game for a job have. but i can tell u, as a pleb: even if they pump mmr into the game, it wouldnt really change that much since wow is an extremely toxic environment. nobody sane wants to learn the game with so much flaming
[1:47:38] bonern123: @Matzefyr thats make you bottom 5% of wow player skillwise
[1:47:42] sarent02: where did he touch him?
[1:47:58] mogreene: @sarent02 he touch his totem
[1:48:08] mvqq: If you pump MMR, who's gonna play at the standard default 1500 MMR that you start at? Surely the default MMR you start at needs to get increased as well, or?
[1:48:08] jaime: the ele is a enha main
[1:48:13] jaime: all of the best eles start as enhance
[1:48:20] HaasFast: sswf is good
[1:48:25] sistahfistah1: hes a turbo player Pog
[1:48:27] hrdstylerz: @thetractorkid it'll make them obtaninable for like 2-3 weeks, because the algorithm is designed for massive population pre-arragned settings, not online low player base matchmaking

[1:49:08] fifathoto21: the majority of pvp players are around 15-1,8

[1:49:12] feastyoureyes_: @mvqq it is not the only game in their pc by the way.

[1:51:38] Xiunitv: thats my reaction when i finally get unbanned from mvqs twitch channel
[1:51:39] joliestarr: @Whaazz ofc ppl want mount but when ppl have to face 3k players on 2.1-2.4k they just give up
[1:51:45] versacexoxo_: did you just swap to gnome?
[1:51:47] versacexoxo_: weren't you orc
[1:51:50] bobthegoblin_: @scardrextv cause more people played the game, has nothing to do with pvp
[1:51:50] min2op: @sevensens o/
[1:51:51] Glotai: people just get elite mogs in shuffle or 2s i think
[1:51:52] feastyoureyes_: @mvqq reducing the rating required for glad or inflating the ladder is the same in giving glad to the same % of players as before
[1:51:53] Elronmcbong38: i did my gladiator last season for the first time - ngl i did it for enchant & mount @Whaazz
[1:51:59] min2op: @sevensens we are victims
[1:52:00] blinkers89: elite mog and title is my dream nowadays. because the mount is unreachable anyway ^^
[1:52:02] mvqq: @feastyoureyes_ yea thats my point
[1:52:02] sind233: Why you be doing my homies gnomes like that
[1:52:04] draiwnur: @Whaazz ofc ppl want mount but when ppl have to face 3k players on 2.1-2.4k they just give up
[1:52:11] nood4e: They are, but I usually get the enchant and stop qing cause 30 minute shuffle wait time
[1:52:12] infernion: Imagine thinking orc looks better than gnome
[1:52:15] Nab1337: you have to embrace the gnome life
[1:52:17] infernion: This is why your opinion is irrelevant
[1:52:18] Faketagsy: @scardrextv because you have to stay in the top 0.5% to get glad, whereas now pushing last week for multi glad players when inflation is highest and doing it in 2 sessions is just the optimal route
[1:52:19] Wootzu: Gnomes with new set looks like a lego
[1:52:25] versacexoxo_: it's gnome that good for warr?
[1:52:29] Sprice19: gnome=master race
[1:52:29] Moobot: Don't forget to follow my Twitter to see when I go live! https://twitter.com/Whaazz
[1:52:29] Nab1337: yea but u could fk him up
[1:52:34] vothros: you need to go back to male with the stache
[1:52:38] infernion: Slice the ankles?
[1:52:39] dankgamer97: You know how to fix that, just download it trenXD
[1:52:41] sistahfistah1: he could step on u Kreygasm
[1:52:41] sind233: Sounds like Ant Man
[1:52:42] Edzea: this warrior used to be human right?
[1:52:44] Zhreytv: Its not the size that matters...
[1:52:47] sind233: Ant man is strong
[1:52:52] mvqq: I swear if casuals didn't fight r1 players all the time they'd q up, and ladder would inflate, and glad would be reachable meaning more people would q up, meaning more inflation
[1:52:52] amnetv: @leomessiofficial
[1:52:59] grris: @Faketagsy I got new acc btw xD
[1:53:07] hrdstylerz: problem is that the only rewards you can get are mog, illusion, mount, title and prestige. However, the mog and mount is not worth the work you have to put in, pvp prestige only exists within pvp cicles and the illusion + title is also too much work for the reward....
[1:53:09] ayosteviey: If casuals can get 3k io in M+ before the .5 patch something doesnt feel right bout the gaqme
[1:53:16] lokum17: Blizzard dont careeee
[1:53:23] sarent02: @mvqq who are does player who face r1 players?
[1:53:24] Withor12: XDDDD
[1:53:35] jaime: top of the ladder matters 10x more than low rating for overall participation
[1:53:38] sarent02: WHO ARE DOES PLAYERS FACING R1 PLAYERS AT 1,2?
[1:53:39] infernion: Casuals aren't facing r1 players at 2.4 unless it's people boosting or playing up their alts
[1:53:43] Lordshaftington: brother i am fighting R1's at 2.1-2.2
[1:53:48] Lordshaftington: noit always, but enough
[1:53:49] scardrextv: @Faketagsy No you just had to be in the top 0.5% when the season ended, not the whole season. By the logical people are using these days every season before BFA season 1 should of been dead with no queues.
[1:53:49] jaime: top pushes = eventually donates larger mmr down and its trickles
[1:53:52] lamonfz: wow pvp is just bad and not enough people want to play it
[1:53:56] eacherro: @ayosteviey WEll, M+ is still the same mechanics... even stupid person can learn these mechanics that are on repeat.. isnt it like this?
[1:53:57] Matzefyr: If you are rank 1 and playing below 2.4k mmr, Blizzard should just take action your account at that point. It is just griefing low level players like myself.
[1:54:01] infernion: No actual r1 player tripple r1 team is stuck at 2.4
[1:54:01] grris: I kinda face casuals at 2.4 like mvq
[1:54:01] mvqq: Casuals are facing r1 players bcus r1 players have 12 alts of the same class.
[1:54:05] sistahfistah1: every team at 2.4 is r1s on alts tho
[1:54:06] blinkers89: i have the fix
[1:54:08] nood4e: Every shuffle is gladiator mount from last 2 seasons. It's disgusting
[1:54:11] ayosteviey: Theres a lot of that going on in 2s
[1:54:14] uninspire: casuals will see someone at 1600 who got glad 8 seasons ago and think theyre just smurfing and blame that and quit instead of getting better
[1:54:18] GRC_chris: 2k players habe r1 players in shuffle all the time
[1:54:21] blinkers89: just give us corruption back. OMEGALUL OMEGALUL OMEGALUL
[1:54:23] sarent02: in shadowlands i was facing glad players every game in every bracked 1.5 -2k rating
[1:54:25] infernion: The r1 players would get 2.6 mmr within 20 games lol
[1:54:26] Kradzer: I mean 2.2-2.4 is just random r1 players, not r1 main teams
[1:54:27] blinkers89: arena bonanza
[1:54:28] Sillken: @mvqq git gud nub
[1:54:30] hrdstylerz: @jaime if the 1% matters 10x more than the 99%, the 99% is still almost 10 times as big
[1:54:34] unsteddy: alts just drain the MMR from the ladder right?
[1:54:36] sevensens: mvq just sees the responsibility with the playerbase but that is not how it works nowdays. Blizz has to do something, the players will just sit it out.
[1:54:38] mvqq: For seeding
[1:54:38] BigMaN7: I'm a casul, I'm sat between 2.2-2.3 and all I face is R1 players
[1:54:47] lmaoerss: i meet multi r1 players at 2,2k most games
[1:54:48] mvqq: And I don't disagree
[1:54:49] iamreallyafan: i haven't agreed with mvqq untill now
[1:54:58] uninspire: plus how long did that alt stay low rated? whazz' "ALTS" are all 2.8k+...
[1:54:59] sarent02: go cord with mag
[1:55:04] infernion: @BigMaN7 As I said, those are probably 2x r1 players and a boost. No tripple r1 plays on 2.3 and doesn't climb from it
[1:55:05] Glotai: @BigMaN7 yea r1/glad players are all over the place when playing above 1.8
[1:55:17] kaasiii: caught in 4k
[1:55:18] JokkeMonk: exposed KEKW
[1:55:24] grris: EXPOSED
[1:55:24] BigMaN7: @infernion you're trolling mate, R1s have multitude of alts and they have to rank at some point
[1:55:26] Lordshaftington: if casuals are fighting multi galds/ R1's it's not only because R1 alts, it's because there aren't enough organic 2.1-2.4 players
[1:55:27] nood4e: Caught in 4k
[1:55:27] diosilvl: "do as I say in twitch chat, not as I do"
[1:55:28] Nab1337: its a chicken/egg problem
[1:55:43] infernion: @BigMaN7 It takes ~20 games to get above 2.3 mmr, they won't be hanging around there for long lets be honest
[1:55:53] Sillken: CAUGHT
[1:55:53] infernion: Look discord Oscar
[1:56:10] BigMaN7: @infernion Yeah after they smack me 3 games in a row, rinse and repeat
[1:56:12] hrdstylerz: i think infernion summed it perfectly in chat a while ago
[1:56:15] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz no the problem is that rank 1 players are hoarding rating
[1:56:23] asdkl2312k3o: and now not playing
[1:56:23] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:56:27] asdkl2312k3o: Kappa
[1:56:34] GRC_chris: 20 games on 5 chars is 100 games quick maths
[1:56:46] hooqs: mvq cant do warsong jumps without ahk beansWalk beansWalk
[1:56:48] BigMaN7: Demonhunter :^)
[1:56:57] antoxdd: @asdkl2312k3o what has this gotta do with blizzard not adding mmr? so if ur a rank1 player u should not be playing the game u pay for monthly?
[1:57:15] infernion: Can't see what you're showing
[1:57:17] Loadedmvp: we see nothing
[1:57:18] asdkl2312k3o: @antoxdd I added a a:kappa
[1:57:19] BigMaN7: @Whaazz share screeen bro
[1:57:21] honeyloop: TTours
[1:57:24] dankgamer97: ApuApustaja
[1:57:28] honeyloop: whaazz always does this guys he is gonna re explain it
[1:57:48] Zurllyn: we cant see
[1:57:48] prenns: i started playing arenas end of shadowlands and now we are playing at 1.9k - 2k mmr and we are amlost every game facing long term multi glads - how are we supposed to reach even 2.1k in 3v3
[1:57:54] honeyloop: HAHA
[1:58:11] antoxdd: ALMOST EVERY GAME A DH LOOK AT IT
[1:58:11] mvqq: Why do we fight a 2.5 team at 2.7? Because there's no qs at 2.5
[1:58:13] Xiunitv: HAHAHA
[1:58:18] amnetv: ye but he started at 2610 and gained only 30 CR
[1:58:19] sevensens: +30 mmr session, nice
[1:58:20] amnetv: i mean MMR
[1:58:21] KingBurn87: didnt he say he got no ques above 2,4-2,5k? LUL
[1:58:23] dankgamer97: Re explain now, like u usually do
[1:58:24] bonern123: atleast its a huge variation in the comps they were facing
[1:58:27] dankgamer97: KEKW
[1:58:40] BigMaN7: He lost that last game haha probably ended on the same MMR
[1:58:43] mvqq: Why do we fight a 2.5 team at 2.7? Because there's no qs at 2.5
[1:58:46] bonern123: forgot the sarcasm marker
[1:58:47] honeyloop: guys count how many dh in this picture :)
[1:58:51] Lordshaftington: there just aren't that many new 2.5 players in the game so of course you aren't going to fight that many people

[1:59:01] Jkrx: 4Head
[1:59:05] infernion: @mvqq They're 2579, they're not low 2.5, you're 2640 so ofc you can face 2579 mate
[1:59:16] mvqq: They're 232 mate, are you blind @infernion
[1:59:20] mvqq: 2532*
[1:59:25] infernion: I mean that's ONE game lol, you had one long queue so you got that, it happens
[1:59:28] infernion: Rest of them was fair?
[1:59:28] KingBurn87: one team yeah
[1:59:32] amnetv: EZ -60 mmr
[1:59:38] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz that team was thesia and brnhity swapxy
[1:59:40] linuswarlock: its so absurd its just all Dh SHaman x
[1:59:46] jaime: this is also not representative of anything because its after midnight
[1:59:53] jaime: there was 2-4 teams only
[1:59:55] jaime: wintrading mmr
[1:59:59] KingBurn87: faces one team at 2,5k and acts like all of them were LUL
[2:00:09] magnusz: thank god that 2.5 team beat ur ass and took ur mmr so u could get more fast qs
[2:00:11] raztvx: dh seems pretty good
[2:00:18] uninspire: DH looks ok yeah
[2:00:21] Xiunitv: getting shrekt by double dh, i dnt play this game is that the reality we live in?
[2:00:29] mvqq: The 2.7 v 2.5 q wasn't long at all
[2:00:33] worbital: what's the name of this addon?
[2:00:41] sarent02: next
[2:00:48] mvqq: u can add the game durations together and see what the q time was
[2:00:51] Nextrkw: yo
[2:00:51] laki_svk: this is why 3s sux becouse its about late farming, avoiding and sniping ....
[2:01:13] Nextrkw: swapxy is the rsham of the team i found out im very dogshit
[2:01:16] shredder1111: r1 players smurfing above 2.5 aint depriving anyone of getting glad though
[2:01:23] Nextrkw: somebody needs to start tweeting about rsham being op

[2:02:04] feastyoureyes_: alts of the same class are a problem
[2:02:06] peestii: its your moment mag
[2:02:08] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz invite him to discord
[2:02:19] snyggunnar: I might be so wrong here. But imo one huge prob is that the game is so meta based. kills the normal ladder. ppl put down so much time into a class that is shit. and dont play. idk its might just me
[2:02:33] Nextrkw: mvqs introduction is gna be him shouting out his own twitch channel
[2:02:33] Moobot: https://www.instagram.com/oscar_wulff/
[2:02:35] thetractorkid: @Luke_Gaming_Channel TRUE

[2:03:06] infernion: @mvqq 5 minutes q, that's fairly long to face a -180 mmr team tbf
[2:03:14] hazardouds: pvp arena is dead at the moment
[2:03:20] mvqq: No. Doesn't work like that. @infernion
[2:03:28] GRC_chris: Blizz just needs to add rating decay for inactivity

[2:03:37] sarent02: i mean meta gaming was always a part of pvp in general
[2:03:39] uninspire: fix DH and i guarantee double the amount of people queueing below 2.2k
[2:03:48] bonern123: @mvqq ye both ways up and down... :D

[2:04:32] blinkers89: is that completely gone nowadays?
[2:04:36] magnusz: if u played with a real dh like mvq instead of raikudh u would go up in mmr a lot faster tbh
[2:04:41] yore7: i press q to have fun in a game
[2:04:43] blinkers89: i mean at least at pleb ratings
[2:04:47] uninspire: thats how he could hti 3k @magnusz

[2:05:39] KingBurn87: queing for fun OMEGALUL
[2:05:40] sarent02: @mvqq lmao
[2:05:42] infernion: 30 min q = 20*30 mmr = Magnus faced team 600 mmr lower
[2:05:44] Karanze: I bring my laptop with me to the gym so I can do my workout and have my shuffle pop in time for when I am done
[2:05:45] magnusz: mvq isnt bored bc he plays the best comp in game at 2.6 and goes 50/50 vs every dh reroll in the game
[2:05:46] Esotraz: but how broken are rogues man x2 rogue in m+ tourney rn
[2:05:46] zzxzzyx: e-cock OMEGALUL
[2:05:49] eacherro: IS really someone playing "COMPETETIVE PVP" for fun? :D

[2:07:13] magnusz: how is raikus dh higher than mvq? isnt that his alt?
[2:07:17] magnusz: i thought mvq was the #1 dh
[2:07:18] infernion: He'd face a 2650 lobby if he queues and lose mmr going 4-2
[2:07:33] Xiunitv: @magnusz cook
[2:07:34] dankgamer97: @magnusz  trenXD
[2:07:40] honeyloop: KEKW
[2:07:43] Esotraz: raiku dmd u to check his history so he could feel good
[2:07:45] Xiunitv: not even scripted, that means its usually scripted chat
[2:07:45] strengthofathousndmen: win trader lobby inc
[2:07:45] uninspire: mvqq cant get above raiku because he keeps matching 2.5 teams unlucky
[2:07:50] sarent02: suffering from succes
[2:08:00] magnusz: mvq will pass them whenever he wants
[2:08:00] infernion: He can queue, just not into a high lobby = lose mmr going 4-2, or if someone ints a game he can't climb
[2:08:11] magnusz: the only reason he hasnt is bc hes a graceful god
[2:08:20] Matzefyr: Isn't the main problem that all of the best players are playing classic, so the good players have nothing to fight against? i mean the greatest players in the world are playing classic, such as minpojke, hydra and qwneer
[2:08:20] Lordshaftington: if they nerfed DH none of these issues would exist i'm convinced
[2:08:28] oj_dk_: damn
[2:08:30] lmaoerss: LUL
[2:08:31] HaasFast: thats a raiku cap
[2:08:31] uninspire: @Matzefyr nice one
[2:08:32] Ryzeneutv: Unpopular opinion, Remove shuffle, Replace with 5v5.
[2:08:35] Xiunitv: @magnusz so nice of mvq to spare us
[2:08:36] HaasFast: u will get a pop just lower
[2:08:38] oj_dk_: max i sat was 2hrs
[2:08:46] Sillken: hell yeah
[2:08:50] Sillken: suffering from success baby
[2:08:52] strengthofathousndmen: @Ryzeneutv better make it as it was in shadowlands, just non-rated troll bracket
[2:08:56] mvqq: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy tho'; people can't get rating bcus ppl camp and ppl camp bcus ppl can't get rating
[2:09:01] sarent02: raikudh is my goat
[2:09:02] peestii: pay quick 50 to raiku fo dat
[2:09:10] infernion: When I'm 2740-2750 and queuing shuffle atm I sit 1-3 hour queue -> 2650 lobby and I lose mmr going 4-2
[2:09:13] infernion: It's pure rng at that point
[2:09:18] uninspire: weird raiku got 5 subs just now for answering that?
[2:09:18] urwronglul: is it possible to intervene and spell reflect a clone ?
[2:09:18] Deblaze88: i got glad last 2 seasons but this seasons mmr makes me doubt that i will get it again
[2:09:20] oj_dk_: i agree healers need to be bnet
[2:09:21] thetractorkid: @mvqq no people cant get rating because the playerbase is small

[2:09:24] magnusz: i love reading mvq try to think it warms my heart
[2:09:25] infernion: 1. Lobby MMR needs to be good 2. Needs to be winnable matchups 3. People need to play good

[4:27:03] nksttv: hi whaaz i saw pikaboo his editor was playing rogue for the first time and he coachin him. would be nice to see from your perspective to someone who doesnt play rogue for a long time
[4:27:14] deucaly: they have to change this game from the base..leave the payment..and make like LoL..trasmo mount every week..and the game will be fine
[4:27:39] Stigez: @pazta9 nop, they would have to fix a lot of things for people to enjoy the game to actually play it
[4:27:50] Robin_26: bro I was vibing to the music
[4:27:52] Stigez: mmr comes naturally if people play
[4:27:56] popuptop: LETS GOOOOOO

[4:28:34] Joke_Fistweaver: game is bad until they fix mmr
[4:29:03] Stigez: @pazta9 like lontar said, its just snowballing, people cry about mmr cause no one plays so you cant climb
[4:29:32] Stigez: like 7min que and not even in r1 cutoff?
[4:29:39] Stigez: people just stop playing after glad mounts
[4:29:42] pazta9: No what lontar said is since people cant gain mmr people stop queing cause there is no point
[4:29:59] pazta9: and that is because blizz fked this season up so hard
[4:30:01] pazta9: no inflation
[4:30:12] Stigez: @pazta9 ofcourse you cant get rating when you face the same team every night :D neither will climb
[4:30:24] Stigez: inflation is just a bandaid fix for the real probelm
[4:30:45] pazta9: but there was a ton of people playing before they fucked it up and then everyone quit
[4:30:46] Stigez: and the real problem is the game just being dead
[4:30:49] pazta9: not the other way around
[4:31:11] Stigez: @pazta9 everyone plays first month or until they get full gear then no one plays until last few weeks

[6:24:06] bottger93: I think you could have ended, Raiku called warrior and got war to 5 % hp while you attacked monk no?
[6:24:15] Kre1e: Indlagt til mandag GG føs på søndag
[6:24:31] cailcail1: so unlucky with the dmg spread at the end with warr going 5% when u went different targets
[6:25:01] iiiidan1994: is disarming healer works on his heals good
[6:25:02] Kre1e: er på morfin og antibiotika lige
[6:25:31] SacsTvT: @Whaazz @iiiidan1994 big true, wont it be worth to disarm the fw? he gets 0 healing for the duration
[6:26:35] monkestronke: disarm his fists?
[6:26:35] iiiidan1994: disarm better than sharpen there myb
[6:26:42] camgirlxo: pretty sure disarm into fw is pointless since none of their abilitys require a wep
[6:26:51] dankgamer97: Cant disarm fw is pointless
[6:27:09] SacsTvT: should decrease dmg a lot tho?
