Mana regeneration occurs in 0. 5-second intervals and is disabled when the unit's current mana exactly equals its maximum mana

[4:36:11] softice84k: The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains a difference or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviation to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position that it wasn't, it now is.
