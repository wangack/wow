[0:53:15] AxelFromAustralia: how did you upset some random 40yo French guy?
[0:53:18] conspiraciesgamer: yes the french are sneaky fuckers
[0:53:26] emiraelee: o7
[0:53:29] Sunderwire_: rip bozo
[0:53:36] CarneMolidaZH: maybe he didnt mean it negatively
[0:53:36] gHOsTa81: o7
[0:53:41] Knaldstiv: back to watch lil p KEKL
[0:53:41] Voidbonx: the retard gauge was full, so he had to use a bit of it
[0:53:44] coolcrazyguy72: payo is 40?

[0:53:48] donkeebrainz: KEKW

[0:53:52] forgedhoodie: literally i few hours bago
[0:53:56] bigsugg: cap
[0:54:04] leroylol: any clips
[0:54:07] EffinsTV: Why did he do it in the first place tho?
[0:54:08] MysticalOS: I've been going up and down wow category all day, Sod is not doing well as phase 1. Interest seems way lower comparatively
[0:54:13] conspiraciesgamer: when did the payo staysafe beef start?
[0:54:25] NooleanB: how many viewers do you think Asmon would get if he organized a streamer boxing tournament?
[0:54:25] lizcat_: jealousy is a bad look
[0:54:27] Voidbonx: have a discord convo with him Pog
[0:54:28] telefonmastdudu: Too based
[0:54:38] paulthecat: u stole his girl?
[0:54:39] milkvodka: i stopped watching him when i realized I was watching a 40 year old fake cringe reactions and baiting drama
[0:54:40] candy_fingers: payo is using a fake accent
[0:54:50] lizcat_: this phase will be longer no rush
[0:54:51] Keyranos: phase 2 took too long to come out
[0:54:55] sweatlordkush: because its harder
[0:55:02] cloudstrife543: it wont be again until 60
[0:55:03] MysticalOS: yeah it did take too long to come out
[0:55:04] sweatlordkush: gnomergan is too hard for most dad gamers
[0:55:09] conspiraciesgamer: phase 1 is always hype
[0:55:10] Alastree: I only know Peyo, the Belgian dude who made The Smurfs
[0:55:14] Jazzarus_: it's always more popular when you start from lvl 1
[0:55:17] indigolab: @Keyranos agreed.  i lost interest quite a bit
[0:55:18] emiraelee: if wow was free to play, viewers would spike
[0:55:22] Voidbonx: any game tbh
[0:55:23] madgarlicjr: one person deciding to play tho could change that perception at any given time tho
[0:55:27] MysticalOS: put it this way, retail is beating Sod 2, and it doesn't even have new content
[0:55:42] Keyranos: @indigolab same, I havent even started my phase 2 yet
[0:55:46] Lynxlar: what happens after phase 4?
[0:55:50] Mauraderss: exceeeept for WOTLK in 2009 it went up the whole expansion
[0:55:51] cloudstrife543: its gonna blow up at 60 again i think
[0:56:09] coolcrazyguy72: holy shit Payo is actually 40
[0:56:12] mamdoh123: FRESH HYPE POGGERS
[0:56:17] MysticalOS: i think people playing, i just don't hink people are streaming it as much.
[0:56:20] coolcrazyguy72: I thought he was early 20’s
[0:56:24] telefonmastdudu: Classic plus Pog
[0:56:31] Mauraderss: maybe people aren’t a big fan of time gated levelling ?
[0:56:34] Voidbonx: SoD Phase 1 with more enemy HP ResidentSleeper
[0:57:12] cloudstrife543: no
[0:57:18] emiraelee: YES
[0:57:19] Shintek: dont they already do that?
[0:57:19] MawblesPDX: Mr.Safe can you check some of your quests to see how much gold they are giving?
[0:57:22] cloudstrife543: i disagree
[0:57:23] Blockaaattv: have you lost your mind.....
[0:57:31] medae: i hate that this model is so profitable but i agree
[0:57:31] Mauraderss: why do one or the other, when you can do both LULW
[0:57:32] Maruika: maybe ?
[0:57:34] xhappyxhappyx: no
[0:57:37] Keyranos: nah they should, at this point they already wrecked their game
[0:57:37] Iol69: absolutely would
[0:57:41] Yarith: what about a lower sub fee or gamepass
[0:57:42] synthezztwo: pserver vibes
[0:57:42] Keyranos: might as well make it f2p
[0:57:45] xhappyxhappyx: I would rather them quadruple the sub and remove cosmetics
[0:57:52] EffinsTV: free to plays are full of bots all the time
[0:57:53] WillowJane: it does, the amount of bots here vs on osrs is pretty insane
[0:57:57] EffinsTV: more than wow is
[0:57:58] WillowJane: its why their gold is dirt cheap KEKW
[0:58:00] unfailable: it would ruin the classic experience
[0:58:00] emiraelee: they can test run SOD free to play and keep retail f2p and see what happens
[0:58:03] carbonzo_bean: hey do you know?
[0:58:07] emiraelee: keep retail paid**
[0:58:25] linkitcraig: AB rep maybe
[0:58:29] Iol69: the fact they have like 4 versions of wow for 15 bucks is nice
[0:58:30] oceanbluess: do it because its fun
[0:58:33] Aldehyde22: the mount is cool though
[0:58:36] totezmcgoatz_: would you use the ring instead of trinket for pvp?
[0:58:38] Mauraderss: @staysafetv did you get SM shoulders?
[0:58:48] Osmosi: Do you get AB rep from it?
[0:58:49] CladeusXE: cosmetics isnt the issue with most, its p2w
[0:58:56] cjadude: pawgers
[0:58:59] nock7urn4l: did you do the abuse at the gy before it was patched @staysafetv
[0:58:59] SkirsdagTv: imagine pushing for a deathless STV or something, could be sick content
[0:59:00] numblezzz: well i just tried to put a sleeping bag down and invite people to be nice, they started ERPing in the bag
[0:59:02] NooleanB: Can the boots be upgraded again?
[0:59:10] dazantaz: are there discords for sod bis lists?
[0:59:13] scyer1129: That's true there are 17.5k playing warmane server for free and they could be playing WoW instead
[0:59:21] Koolag: hey quick question should i play warrior or rogue what do you think?
[0:59:33] lizcat_: meta warlock list looks easy
[0:59:35] Buddkinz: @nock7urn4l wut happened with gy
[0:59:36] xhappyxhappyx: yeah even without the exploit if you just play the event you will get the gear pretty quick
[0:59:50] Metaphix: super poor ppl too
[0:59:51] Milanesa_De_Pollo: South Americans too
[0:59:52] nock7urn4l: @buddkinz what happened in terms of what was the exploit? or how did they patch it?
[0:59:53] Yarith: @lizcat_ Pog  im the nerd warlock who saw you in UC earlier today if thats you saviseHi saviseHi saviseHi
[0:59:57] PopsBarnGrill: 46 raiders from PopsBarnGrill have joined! 
[0:59:57] MysticalOS: i also will never 100% trust the numbers put out by private servers.
[0:59:59] Metaphix: oh nvm
[1:00:00] gryphsx: surely warmane reports their player count correctly Kappa
[1:00:09] lizcat_: POPS! PogU
[1:00:12] JustVoIta: only Private server ppl would play is ascension since its classless
[1:00:13] MysticalOS: doesn't mean they're not popping off but they probably fluff it too
[1:00:18] Mauraderss: did they stop serving those countries for political reasons or logistics?
[1:00:20] PopsBarnGrill: Hey Staysafe
[1:00:21] CassieLayne: POPS RAID cassie61DancingDevil cassie61DancingDevil cassie61DancingDevil cassie61DancingDevil
[1:00:25] lizcat_: @yarith yes that was me!!! sstvWAVE
[1:00:28] Buddkinz: @nock7urn4l what was the exploit about, didnt hear about it
[1:00:30] numblezzz: most of private servers are historically kids, poors, and paypigs
[1:00:43] Metaphix: KEKL
[1:00:46] Sunderwire_: KEKL
[1:00:49] rbo2992: "capacity"
[1:00:51] Mawshaw: Thinking it's actually 17k is GIGA COPIUM
[1:00:54] Voidbonx: true
[1:00:55] imradioaktive: KEKW
[1:00:56] Koolag: hey quick question should i play warrior or rogue what do you think?

[1:01:08] Yarith: saviseBounce saviseBounce saviseBounce saviseBounce saviseBounce  cool beanz lizcat saviseBounce saviseBounce saviseBounce saviseBounce
[1:01:09] nock7urn4l: @buddkinz basically there was a “spirit healer” at the graveyard that you could instant resurrect with full health and mana. basically everyone stood at the graveyard spamming revive and just blowing each other up in a cluster fuck
[1:01:09] forgedhoodie: when should i use fodders
[1:01:10] Voidbonx: logs in, ghost towns KEKLL

[1:01:35] Koolag: hey quick question should i play warrior or rogue what do you think?
[1:01:42] numblezzz: cope to make them think their efforts on the server are legit
[1:01:50] EffinsTV: As popular as Phase 1 classic wrath?
[1:01:55] jthom1894: @staysafetv do you think SoD is successful so far
[1:01:56] Maruika: is it possible to level in STV atm ?
[1:01:57] nock7urn4l: @buddkinz people were getting 700+ copper every event. they changed it by making you get a debuff when you revive so you can’t get credit for kills basically
[1:02:08] weasil_: enchanting for the spell power thingy?
[1:02:11] coolcrazyguy72: there is lots of players on warmane wotlk
[1:02:13] Koolag: i like bolt thats my probleme
[1:02:16] Frayeen: warmane been faking pop since first launch everyone know this
[1:02:31] WillowJane: @Koolag at 30 you get zerker stance and start weaving between that and battle stance depending on procs. very fun
[1:02:33] MysticalOS: i think sods been good, just paced too slow. there was no reason for phase 1 to be as long as it was
[1:02:33] leroylol: sod feels like a new game which is good
[1:02:37] numblezzz: warmane adds bots to the server to make it seem more populated monkaHmm
[1:02:41] leroylol: refreshes leveling
[1:02:41] Mauraderss: bis list Pog
[1:03:06] DrDeath30: ya dog
[1:03:09] PopsBarnGrill: Yes, life is good
[1:03:14] Iol69: i havent even touched warmane since before wotlk but it was always very busy when i played
[1:03:17] OptimusBanana420: yeah dog 󠀀
[1:03:26] Koolag: @WillowJane i dm you in private
[1:03:42] Mauraderss: anyone else showing a blank screen?
[1:03:50] Mauraderss: we can’t see staysafe
[1:03:54] numblezzz: you shouldnt be asking others about what class you want to play
[1:03:58] m8vpgamer: Guten morgen stay safe
[1:04:30] Mawshaw: NOP
[1:04:33] cosmodaman: My wand is average
[1:04:37] gharbit: was watching arena champs earlier and only had 10k viewers… retail is in such a sad state nowadays.
[1:04:39] m8vpgamer: i've been up all night and just tuned i again
[1:04:39] Mawshaw: Just stam bloated boots
[1:05:05] m4honen: 12 stam 5 spir
[1:05:09] numblezzz: @gharbit i still play retail arena but i rarely watch awc. just a shitty esports medium
[1:05:09] Scoffered: quest item
[1:05:10] coolcrazyguy72: sm neck
[1:05:10] m4honen: guest reward
[1:05:12] coolcrazyguy72: quest
[1:05:19] MysticalOS: i think the mechanics are more about not being bad than anything. watching people face tank 10 stacks instead of swapping or kiting to clear them etc was far more issue in gnomer
[1:05:23] thebedshow: RFD quest
[1:05:29] EffinsTV: has armor tho
[1:05:33] thebedshow: or SM
[1:05:42] conspiraciesgamer: have you done gnomer yet SS?

[1:05:55] Maruika: is there any items locked behind supply crates atm for p2
[1:06:02] gharbit: @numblezzz yeah but a game that’s doing well doesn’t have that low of viewership regardless
[1:06:03] MrSchneetzel: tank lock is op
[1:06:05] linkitcraig: ghostshard

[2:50:28] Xelakir: I agree. I try to learn something new every day. Today I started learning how to automate repetitive tasks through a program called UIPath
[2:50:30] bazzzgg: That was actually really good advice for a wow stream kudos KEKW
[2:50:52] bdub503: I’ve never thought of it like that. only in finance have I created those streams. the emotional streams seem very important
[2:50:53] Tobssessxic: 6Head infinite content
[2:51:02] phamburglar: level up? DOPAMINE

[2:53:00] xGeroven: are you planning on leveling ur alt as well now that ur 40 on ur main?
[2:53:16] dtl78: money= everything
[2:53:44] Bluebunnyboy: Figured, just wanted to hear your reasoning :)
[2:53:50] AxelFromAustralia: money= everything. enjoyment=meaningless
[2:54:04] spike82q: like make a website and data mine  people data and sell it to advertizers?
[2:54:09] Hackwork: why is productivity so important? why should I produce instead of enjoying myself?
[2:54:16] Humansoup: I agree :)

[2:55:26] northshanks: Has anyone else had this issue? My hunter's chest runes just mysteriously stopped working. I've tried switching runes, chest pieces, aspects for some reason, bounced around characters, and logged all the way out and back in. Nothing.
[2:55:35] davyyjones: has he used subjugate demon on another play yet
[2:55:44] osopolar1977: kek

[2:56:14] bazzzgg: THE WATER IS TURNING THE FROGS GAY
[2:56:21] Hackwork: @unscconnor2 considering that most issues on the planet are related to capitalism or religion, then yes, there is somewhat of an issue. Promoting productivy during the very late stages of capitalism is peak capitalism and ignorance
[2:56:48] fanniclap: I hated not being able to make my own schedule and not being able to do what I want when I want. So I work for myself and work really hard some days to have others off. Took a few years of suffering but oh well.

[2:57:14] mysteriousm4n: no
[2:57:37] m4honen: why not cloak defense?
[2:57:39] unscconnor2: @Hackwork promoting being useful is just terrible. i think i will just smoke a blunt and be a vegetable in my apartment all day. good advice bro
[2:57:47] PineTarKush_TTV: sounds like gambling

[4:38:14] Xammy0: @lagginginironforge found the satanist kek
[4:38:29] lagginginironforge: @bnastyv2 You dont just encourage society to do what you want. We punish for poor choices.
[4:38:42] Mordean: @StaysafeTV have you gotten all of the new runes ?
[4:38:50] Mordean: ahh ok
[4:38:53] inspiredtv: @lagginginironforge this is a very bad take lmfao

[4:39:18] Mordean: might try lock next
[4:39:27] inspiredtv: @lagginginironforge Shame is good, maybe you meant shame but punishment is a little extreme and socialist
[4:39:36] lagginginironforge: @bnastyv2 Society. It the reason the entire podcast exists in the first place.
[4:39:49] Cromaidus: @mordean Shamans are what Chads play
[4:39:51] Xammy0: some cultures have more shame than others, see Japan
[4:39:58] lagginginironforge: @inspiredtv Shame is a punishment
[4:40:00] Mordean: @Cromaidus NODDERS
[4:40:08] Nizzmoe: Nizzmoe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[4:40:16] bnastyv2: @lagginginironforge so society decides for everyone how they should live their life???

[4:40:36] Xammy0: @lagginginironforge historically, yeah pretty much
[4:40:38] inspiredtv: @lagginginironforge I would not say that shame is punishment

[4:46:04] inspiredtv: ah I see
[4:46:23] inspiredtv: Invisible is potion only right?
[4:46:26] rabbatios: fel hunter will increase your stealth detection
[4:46:30] KhalaVenix: lurk 2.0
[4:46:32] Xammy0: is shadowmeld invisible?
[4:46:33] boldpotato2: gnomish cloaking device

[4:48:06] dave3ooo: in classic
[4:48:12] dave3ooo: but you're not stealth'd
[4:48:12] niigghtmare34: fade is temp aggro drop
[4:48:14] KhalaVenix: in retail it drastically reduced your aggro range basically
[4:48:28] dave3ooo: no
[4:48:31] plae007: @kappaminator_gg no
[4:48:43] Mordean: its neither, its just a attack range reduction and threat remover

[5:33:10] 0scarM1k3: The earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back to 5500 BCE and is found in what is now Kuyavia, Poland, where strainers coated with milk-fat molecules have been found. Cheesemaking may have begun independently of this by the pressing and salting of curdled milk to preserve it.

[5:34:43] TheEndIsNear777: gone*
[5:34:45] cubensis69: Smegma is the thick, white, cheesy substance that collects under the foreskin of the penis. It's more common in uncircumcised men who don't clean that area well enough. Women can also get smegma in their vaginal area.  It's normal to have some smegma. And it usually isn't a health problem, but bacteria can grow in it and smell bad. Those bacteria can also make the head of the penis swell up and hurt.  Keeping your penis or vagina clean is the best solution.
[5:34:47] corsair714: UNCUT UNVAXXED UNBOTHERED. you should make merch I would buy 1000%

[6:32:43] Exigaet: They also need to completely disincentivize raids in STV. If you're in a group with more than 5 people then you need to take like 1000% more damage or have your damage reduced by 90% or something. Slowing your movement speed does nothing
[6:32:47] luzid7: how do you feel about shadow priest i just critt 1300 death xD
[6:33:20] m0ng0os3: @StaysafeTV hey bud! What pet did you use for soloing and is  siphon life worth it?

[6:52:07] pickupXO: in th uk we split african descendants into those form africa and those from the caribbean. The african ones outperfom their white counterparts, whilst the caribban ones underperform.

[6:52:17] Travexx: guild drama Pog get him
[6:52:19] jokerdsbarber: Brings me so much joy knowing that immigration legal and illegal will continue to ramp up slowly bringing the complete destruction of America while their resources are overwhelmed, completely deserved for the crimes America has done to nations across the world :)
[6:52:27] Vespyyr: Shouldn't we need to see a chart like that with all the countries' demographics broken out
[6:52:28] Hopeloo: Africa is invading Europe at the moment. So almost every European country also has minorities to bring the average score down.

[6:52:58] Aeycka__: @AmarokUnchained unironically this
[6:53:00] alidaris77: but you can't compare US whites vs other countries in general
[6:53:07] morerpplisjeff: @Kederdoddel is it not true?
[6:53:26] AmarokUnchained: yep
[6:53:27] jokerdsbarber: @ryufromstreets6 america will be destroyed within and it will be a good thing. You will pay your taxes which fund illegal immigrants hahaha, deserved :)

[6:53:47] NooleanB: Unless your children find interracial partners
[6:53:49] SmashPuniGodTv: Statistics are in the end only statistics, it all comes down to one self.
[6:53:56] alidaris77: it is fair, but you are not comparing against norway whites for example, you are comparing with countries in general

[7:04:40] Bearrdman: can u still kill people with the debuff?
[7:04:49] luzid7: just ress at the spirit healer people don't attack you then most of the time because they see the debuff
[7:04:55] AmarokUnchained: other players
[7:05:00] Hitmarkz: if you're killing someone with the debuff why wouldnt they kill you tho
[7:05:02] dipchit1: this "event" is even lower effort than i expected from blizz
[7:05:02] KaffeKod: Warlocks having a longer ramp up time than lets say rogues also makes it worse
[7:05:08] bots_bots: you should rez and regroup at the spirit healer
[7:05:09] justsmilin247: greifersamirite

[7:05:41] blakeshow: they could just do it to grief
[7:05:49] shadowlink1111: Patch notes said theyre changing the buff to a debuff so other players can see you're bloodless, so maybe they can't see it right now?
[7:06:19] holyshirtpro: the lumber was there the otherday. did it get removed? your suppose to buy it and turn it in at arathi i thought
[7:06:30] Varels1: debuffs can be seen regardless if allied or hostile
[7:06:36] Bawls_hang_low: Damn Warlock seems weak in pvp this phase
[7:06:36] rindun: You can see debuffs but not buffs, right?
[7:06:38] FeanorEUW: blood fuck some ppl
[7:07:01] LilHuggernaut: How does BFD gear hold up to SM gear?
[7:07:02] dj_clerik: another thought about bloodless - what if it made you invisible until it dropped

[7:12:22] tripledistance: blizz workers have weekends?

[7:12:32] MrLongGone: was solo farming SM faster than grouping?
[7:12:34] 6_sd: mobs give one blood coin if you kill them :D

[8:14:55] CeltaRebaixado: Ez
[8:15:15] TheWhiteRabbitxX: also studies that measured brain activity of women show little to no stimulation from pictures of attractive men, but video was totally active. so as a streamer they get to see you as well.
[8:15:24] triggs390: A WOMAN
[8:15:27] ca_Y_z: dont overthink yourself. study your surroundings, if bored

[8:16:26] SupreemLeeder11: monkaHmm so what you're saying is... we all need to start streaming if we want a hot German wife?
[8:16:27] NooleanB: Maybe kathy has 2000 friends
[8:16:35] notoriousz: she had to be desperate
[8:16:41] AxelFromAustralia: otherwise it’d be sexual harassment
[8:16:42] notoriousz: to dm u

[8:19:02] HeisyTV: Talking to other people? monkaW
[8:19:03] Hamulon: @realtofe As long as you aren't being a creep.
[8:19:09] Talgarx: What is this pvp damage
[8:19:11] IR_ish: fun fact, you can just sit where ever you want and talk to people
[8:19:21] IR_ish: some are into that some are not

[8:19:58] G4PING: step 1. unugly step 2. rizzgod
[8:19:59] Zodiamaster: true
[8:20:02] Furuluru: If you are ugly you just got bad cards handed to you by RNG
[8:20:03] helixzqt: if ur ugly, work out
[8:20:04] leech0000: can you be fat?
[8:20:09] MOXP: Big corporate jobs? There are some career single chicks
[8:20:22] MOXP: Or university ofc
[8:20:27] SupreemLeeder11: YEP Personally i like the Mall, or Trader Joe's

[8:20:36] MagiZinc: with a beard tho
[8:20:36] Travexx: When are we going to get some chat physique checks
[8:20:40] Aeycka__: it's hard to be sporty and ugly -> look at professional athletes
[8:20:42] IR_ish: being fat is a exponential negative attractive modifier
[8:20:45] JustinOne: few BBWs
[8:20:45] LiquidOctopus: 80% of being attractive is not being fat
[8:20:46] vanHaamme: True
[8:20:47] coeursiy: we exist
[8:20:50] Feets1337: based

[8:21:58] ScootSmith: and very money conscious lmaoooo
[8:22:16] FieryEgon: Do you think kaise and asmon are a couple?
[8:22:18] LiquidOctopus: hot take asmon isnt hideous either
[8:22:28] talonzz1: Have you met asmongold IRL
[8:22:29] EmanuShow: Asmongold is more handsome among women than you think
[8:22:31] apacheD: Isn't Asmon just skinny because of the meth addiction, bought by those multi millions? Kappa
[8:22:33] madabber_: asmon would pull more girls than most of you
[8:22:38] EmanuShow: He just dont give a f
[8:22:40] TheWhiteRabbitxX: Asmon is incredibly charismatic, and he can tell stories really well I knew a guy very much like that and even though he was like 400 pounds girls would flock to him and just talk to talk to him because he was really cool to be around
[8:22:42] vanHaamme: He just looks like a well kempt homeless man.
[8:22:42] Batresh: yuo need to go tank build staysafe u lose nearly no damage but cant fear but u wont always die to rogues and wars
[8:22:46] vades_cro: Are you doing your Duolingo ?
[8:22:58] Metaphix: remember when you were riding in the car and talking about sharing a streamer house like forever ago lol
[8:23:01] vades_cro: <3
[8:23:03] G4PING: bruh no ones saying hes ugly but i dont think asmons handsomeness is his most attractive trait to women LUL
[8:23:20] TheWhiteRabbitxX: Asmon is also very intelligent, and I feel you are as well Staysafe. it’s one of the reasons I like watching
[8:23:20] Childplz: whats the max pvp rank for p2?
[8:23:25] Fluffshock: Asmongold is generally attractive and over 6 ft tall anyone who says otherwise is being stupid
[8:23:29] Metaphix: prolly for the better tbh LUL you got a family
[8:23:30] AxelFromAustralia: Asmon is probably well hung
[8:23:40] Batresh: @Fluffshock hes not hygienic though
[8:23:41] EmpathyLiveChat: @STREAMSNIPELUL He might be quite selective when it comes to women. I don't think he ****s around.
[8:23:55] vanHaamme: @Batresh exactly
[8:24:19] Metaphix: 100% you have to do all the work
[8:24:19] MFpatrix: true. very rare

[8:24:25] 79trdude: most never have to
[8:24:28] Finicky____: I dont like to agree but I agree LUL
[8:24:31] SpecialAgent_FeelsDankMan: they dont have to LuL
[8:24:32] 79trdude: si thats true
[8:24:37] apacheD: The worst thing is men bending over all their values to please a woman, to increase his chances.
[8:24:48] LiquidOctopus: its true yes
[8:24:51] Metaphix: OK i'm here, entertain me. Go on lol
[8:24:52] dazantaz: getting stupid bitch answers, love it
[8:24:57] NooleanB: What's the best/worst breed of dog to pick up women at the dog park?
[8:25:00] IR_ish: people love to talk about themselves
[8:25:01] vanHaamme: That's what I've found to be true for me as well.  And now with the social media self idolization toxin flooding the weak minded, it's only getting worse.
[8:25:02] TheWhiteRabbitxX: a hack I discovered working at a gym is just ask girls trivial questions yeah.. what’s your favorite ice cream flavor? favorite color? etc… you are totally right
[8:25:07] AxelFromAustralia: that’s bro a secret that’s game chapter 1
[8:25:09] dazantaz: it never pans out to anything meaningful tho

[8:25:22] DocTwitchy: true
[8:25:32] AntarcticTreaty: @nooleanb XL Bully
[8:25:33] apacheD: It is important to find an intelligent woman. An attractive but unintelligent woman will not give you a good family or good kids.
[8:25:36] vanHaamme: I met a girl and she asked for my snapchat and I told her I don't have any social media.  She replied, "that's weird"
[8:25:48] cnxt1101: dead and dead dam
[8:25:57] ReconMazihoFanda: top3 strong pvp classes?
[8:25:58] TheWhiteRabbitxX: @apached in my experience if you find a very intelligent woman that’s also attractive she is married
[8:26:20] TheWhiteRabbitxX: lol true
[8:26:27] lastdeviljoker666: pick the ugly one no one will steal her off ya

[8:27:22] Metaphix: lip fillers, BBL, instant no
[8:27:26] Bluesmith: Bluesmith subscribed with Prime. 
[8:27:31] Blitzergman12345: It's funny because as I've aged, intellectual maturity and wisdom has become far more attractive than a nice body.
[8:27:42] brian_mus: Cant cap, i wouldnt want to date a super hot woman, they can be mid and its good to me
[8:27:54] AxelFromAustralia: Babylonian whore
[8:28:04] vanHaamme: lol
[8:28:08] TheWhiteRabbitxX: lmao
[8:28:10] ashmodean1234: so what class is good in pvp in p2?
[8:28:16] Clintodd: women are scary
[8:28:17] apacheD: There's nothing wrong with a woman being attractive. Just not at the expense of good values and intelligence. It's a balance.
[8:28:18] siremethyr: @STREAMSNIPELUL i feel ya BibleThump
[8:28:28] Furuluru: Personality is BIS
[8:28:35] vanHaamme: BIS for sure
[8:28:37] LiquidOctopus: It's been harder for me to find a woman who wants to be a stay at home mother
[8:28:46] TheWhiteRabbitxX: exactly. took me til I was 35 to realize personality shapes how attractive someone is to you
[8:28:46] lastdeviljoker666: nope i want to die fucking a super hot women when im old
[8:28:49] apacheD: In the long run, the personality and values are more important than the looks. Looks fade.
[8:28:51] Furuluru: I LOVE Trap launcher
[8:28:52] Metaphix: hot women havent usually experienced life in a realistic way. The halo effect has seen things handed to them. I respect the hell out of uggo chicks because they are down here with the dudes in brutal reality lol
[8:29:06] vanHaamme: Super butt fucked sucks, sometimes.
[8:29:09] SwankyTuna: dont be spreading lies, we dont need more fotm rerollin boomies
[8:29:13] cheetobbob: where do you pick up the new raid buff
[8:29:18] IR_ish: there is other things
[8:29:23] Droppyy: definitely not
[8:29:26] apacheD: She needs to compliment you. Be a good mother.
[8:29:28] Droppyy: it would get so stale

[11:02:04] Plokoon100: grind*
[11:02:04] studshift: @StaysafeTV thoughts on them needing to reduce damage in PvP combat by ~30-40% ?
[11:02:07] IR_ish: agreed, nerf hunters
[11:02:20] johnnypoison69: arathi is easily the best classic BG
[11:02:21] nekodaye: arathi sucks too
[11:02:23] Plokoon100: is sit the same like... rep amount?
[11:02:25] Fudge2: wsg = chasing druids.  chasing druids is not fun
[11:02:26] nekodaye: AV all day

[11:03:35] bigkuntey: Is this bonus exp in the room with us right now?
[11:03:38] Atomized: I think you'll do better in AB once you get some better gear and runes
[11:03:40] Philopinos: then mana pools needs to be bigger aswell..
[11:03:59] Atomized: monkaHmm
[11:04:06] crouder: no

[11:04:28] Helbo: Some of the weapons are cool, but not huge
[11:04:30] xBirdisword: why would we want insane powercreep? everyone already oneshots eachother ICANT
[11:04:31] Plokoon100: i mean.. that good. to want you to be super juiced
[11:04:31] endraga1: i didnt really do bfd so its cool for me
[11:04:31] PippTheKid: some of the stuff for tank shaman is pretty big
[11:04:37] dave3ooo: not everyone is walking into p2 w/ full bis lol
[11:04:41] therealrickdiculous: true
[11:04:42] shizocks: @StaysafeTV i agree, idk what i expected but its hard to get excited for a few more stats
[11:04:43] AxelFromAustralia: I want insane power creep
[11:04:45] IR_ish: and then you go to naxx
[11:04:46] Atomized: gotta remember you're still level 40. those little upgrades go a long way
[11:04:46] Plokoon100: Then you look like a bug
[11:04:49] madgarlicjr: yay, the hamsterwheel is in full effect FeelsOkayMan
[11:04:54] tsetse2fly: aq40 is great upgrade for some
[11:04:54] basone: aq20 had some cranker items for war
[11:04:58] malmmalm: unless you play a feral, then AQ is poggers
[11:05:01] SipDatLean: at least there are interesting trinkets in AQ
[11:05:01] SeraphimV2: good for powercreep, which is beginning to be a problem, bosses in gnomer has almost the same hp as mc bosses
[11:05:08] AxelFromAustralia: im doing only 50 more dps than level 25 and im level 36 now feels sad
[11:05:15] basone: was fine aq40 had like 2 giga bis items
[11:05:27] tsetse2fly: pre-bis mc gear
[11:05:39] dave3ooo: but then people would cry that they do no dam in bfd
[11:05:39] therealrickdiculous: agreed
[11:05:50] thatquidproquo: ZF

[11:06:04] SeraphimV2: we had better gear in 25 is better than my prebis in 60
[11:06:07] SeraphimV2: exactly
[11:06:08] SeraphimV2: KEKW
[11:06:14] madgarlicjr: true
[11:06:25] Atomized: the SM gear is gonna be what you go into whatever raid with 100%
[11:06:31] AxelFromAustralia: I love power creep
[11:06:33] dave3ooo: true, but they're already redoing gear in mc
[11:06:46] linkitcraig: mostly the caster stuff
[11:06:49] linkitcraig: to make them viable
[11:06:56] fuguelah: mob scaling is crazy though
[11:06:57] dadoffive81: Blew their load to quick on BFD loot
[11:07:13] AxelFromAustralia: power creep if the gear is attractive is power flirting, but power creep when gear is ugly is power harassment
[11:07:34] Loynix: dust to dust
[11:07:48] EmanuShow: I see a corpse
[11:07:54] dave3ooo: imagine not constantly having a savory deviate on
[11:08:03] Nightbot: @obstata -> LANGUAGE VIOLATION [warning]
[11:08:04] Childplz: did u buy any blood moon gear?

[11:20:32] IR_ish: you need to be 18 to post in this chat
[11:20:36] aekovontwitch: Is Uldaman open? I haven't seen a stream of it yet
[11:20:37] xBirdisword: theyre learning how to master the tiktok algorithm
[11:20:39] Vicente_Prime: Excell is OP
[11:20:43] divadnothsa: yes'\
[11:20:45] divadnothsa: they are
[11:20:49] cromez16: They do in the form of learning games I work in a primary center lol
[11:20:50] PondoTTV: no elementary school

[11:21:06] Vicente_Prime: it's BASIC as fuck
[11:21:06] scivationx: My son has had a laptop in his class since 2nd grade that he uses pretty much daily.
[11:21:07] Alareas: In the UK in primary schools they teach 'block-based' coding, which is coding principles but less reliant on the syntax itself.
[11:21:08] martelko: We were learning coding in primary school when I was 13
[11:21:20] drowzey: is warlock just as now? regrettig not going spriest first
[11:21:23] aekovontwitch: Is Uldaman open? I haven't seen a stream of it yet
[11:21:27] Gooseberries: Badumtis
[11:21:28] martelko: That was 25 years ago, but it was super primitive
[11:21:30] gator13_: they actually do teach coding to like 4-5th graders
[11:21:31] Henry_Ash: we learned html for myspace lmao
[11:21:34] Vicente_Prime: yeah, same here
[11:21:36] fart_boiii: my dad has made a great living off coding
[11:21:37] Smokjoker: virtual studio is what we used @staysafetv
[11:21:37] obstata: english plz
[11:21:38] B0ykot: a friend of mine has a 11 yr old and he himself has said they do programming
[11:21:42] fart_boiii: working for bofa
[11:21:46] infom0rph: @StaysafeTV how do you feel about warlock runes this phase?
[11:21:46] GrompyMonk: I work in IT for a public school system. We have a 1 to 1 program. Middle School through High school every kid is assigned a Dell laptop
[11:21:46] boopbopbamski: Good Morning staysafe are you going to spend countless hours farming chocolate boxes so you can gain a small amount of DPS and parse in a 20 year old video game/
[11:21:46] xBirdisword: Scratch FeelsOkayMan
[11:21:47] Vicente_Prime: it's for kids
[11:21:48] gator13_: its in form of games etc but its very simple coding
[11:21:48] bl0pp3r: @staysafetv In Europe, it is pretty common that coding is taught to all students in school
[11:21:50] IR_ish: like visual aided spaghetti coding
[11:21:53] scivationx: They haven't really taught them anything as far as typing or MS products etc. Mostly just using websites and apps for online learning
[11:21:53] osopolar1977: chat lieing
[11:21:55] sLr_____: I learner coding in like the 9th grade, but it was fucking Pascal KEKL
[11:22:02] donkeebrainz: pepeLaugh
[11:22:06] irrefutable_ire: @sLr_____ Same LULW
[11:22:09] Vicente_Prime: they are preparing kids to repair computers
[11:22:12] Plokoon100: xD
[11:22:14] Vicente_Prime: it's true dude xD
[11:22:17] B0ykot: to some degree it is, isnt that unbelivable
[11:22:19] cromez16: lol the coding catipllar is a hit with my students!
[11:22:20] Draxamius: teacher in the UK and 11 year olds learn binary coding here
[11:22:32] Alareas: I used to be a primary teacher though and children's 'computer literacy' is shockingly bad. Most households only have phones/tablets so watching like a kid/teen using a mouse and keyboard is often... not good.
[11:22:37] Dimkoputon: @StaysafeTV what are your thoughts on the tucker - putin interview?
[11:22:39] icylemons1993: Pizza

[11:22:56] mangde_d33d: @staysafetv hows the farm going?
[11:23:05] MudcrabBlacksmith: "The world will only need about 7 computers in total"
[11:23:14] cancer69420911: @StaysafeTV How do you feel about this being all a simulation played on by God?
[11:23:14] jamesQodex: We teach 6 year old how to do special ops missions infiltrating enemy states economy and causing big dmg to there system
[11:23:17] linkitcraig: david letterman interviewing bill gates about the internet encapsulated that well
[11:23:18] infom0rph: it's underwhelming
[11:23:22] mangde_d33d: How much is a win?
[11:23:41] beannator: 10 rep per 200 points
[11:23:45] bl0pp3r: @staysafetv most people in your chat havent lived a single minute where internet was not a thing
[11:23:47] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV Look up scratch, they're using stuff like that to learn basic coding
[11:23:52] beannator: so eaven if you lose bad you will get atleast 10 or 20
[11:23:58] DefaTL: yea youre not getting that done today
[11:24:11] Draxamius: teacher in the UK and 11 year olds learn coding here
[11:24:18] Synmachus: You need honored befoe tomorrow?
[11:24:26] mangde_d33d: And one arathi takes average 15 min?
[11:24:26] Hamulon: Yes
[11:24:27] donkeebrainz: no
[11:24:28] IR_ish: nah, you need to know coding
[11:24:28] Moo360: no
[11:24:29] divadnothsa: yes
[11:24:30] aSyLuM320: yes
[11:24:32] Smokjoker: kinda
[11:24:35] SoochSandals: kinda yea
[11:24:36] hemsho: no, but cooking should be
[11:24:36] squirtgunpumper: yes
[11:24:36] tsetse2fly: good thing
[11:24:37] infom0rph: 11 is too young for coding
[11:24:38] martelko: Yes, at least basics
[11:24:41] infom0rph: no
[11:24:42] clamthenerd: no, but it's happening
[11:24:42] IR_ish: to be able to use and service anything in the future
[11:24:44] nex_zus: my son is in 2. grade they where learning code through LEGO
[11:24:45] PondoTTV: AI will be coding in no time
[11:24:47] Hamulon: Coding is problem solving
[11:24:48] aSyLuM320: just the fundamentals. They are mostly problem solving fundamentals and syntactical
[11:24:48] MotionLayout: yes it stimulates logical thinking
[11:24:51] Atomized: I don't want my entire society THAT tech focused to where it's a part of everyones life
[11:24:52] divadnothsa: yeah coding and even basic office work in spread sheets used code
[11:24:53] Warriorfall: the logic involved in coding is good for the development of the brain, prolly
[11:24:54] Hamulon: so yes
[11:24:54] jameserush1: I think learning to code and can be a good way to develop problem solving
[11:24:56] IR_ish: at least what it does is teach logic
[11:24:58] cromez16: If you saw it I think it would be less daunting it's not just 0's and 1's
[11:25:01] bl0pp3r: @staysafetv coding can be a tool for every single job in the world, it is not always a job itself
[11:25:02] icylemons1993: im balder
[11:25:06] infom0rph: certain computing skills yes, coding no
[11:25:07] mangde_d33d: Start early with basics?
[11:25:11] paine_xo: lets be honest theres certainly more controversial things being taught
[11:25:12] Moo360: x to doubt
[11:25:12] osopolar1977: it’s useless imo coding will be done by bots
[11:25:14] aSyLuM320: "Google 101"
[11:25:16] donkeebrainz: coding is for nerds
[11:25:18] linkitcraig: that's what we learned with google searching
[11:25:18] squirtgunpumper: thats already happening with coding
[11:25:23] Hamulon: But then who is making the AI
[11:25:23] Warriorfall: coding is for LEMONS
[11:25:25] IR_ish: THAT is regression
[11:25:25] fart_boiii: education is trash lets be real
[11:25:26] Zankyew: aka prompt engineering
[11:25:26] MudcrabBlacksmith: probably
[11:25:26] drewzydrew: definitely, coding teaches you how to think logically and systematically
[11:25:31] squirtgunpumper: coding already use ai blocks
[11:25:32] 1needamedic: alreadyhappening
[11:25:33] fart_boiii: were lucky its as good as it is
[11:25:41] Atomized: Similar to how coding is just prompts to tell your CPU instructions
[11:25:42] donkeebrainz: fart boi is back
[11:25:47] irrefutable_ire: If you ever tried to do anything serious with AI you'll realize that it sucks balls and is a dumbfuck
[11:25:49] aSyLuM320: Who knew "Let Me Google That For You" would become not a meme
[11:25:52] martelko: Basics for coding teaches you the understanding how apps and programs work, which help basic awareness similar to knowledge that knife is sharp, don't cut people with it
[11:25:59] donkeebrainz: @fart_boiii
[11:26:14] cromez16: *GASP
[11:26:19] boopbopbamski: is that the drug gum?

And they hone in on tthose before during and after the game. Hence the rigged feeling. Then ofc, some games in of themselves might be scuffed, bribed refs and what not.

[12:26:42] Smokjoker: ?
[12:26:43] thatsrealneeto: The way to win at chess is when you take your opponents pawn for the first time in a game just pick it up and bite it in half.  You will assert dominance and they'll resign

[12:29:27] Atomized: I would've guessed sask
[12:29:27] daget91: Tax rates are Federal
[12:29:27] RagnarVolarus80: fuck no it’s not BC
[12:29:29] crennerc: I made 120k, in Ontario I pay 25% avg tax
[12:29:31] SpiteNL: BC more beautiful
[12:29:31] crennerc: 35% marginal
[12:29:37] Hamulon: Nova Scotia has 21% Provincial Income Tax
[12:29:38] RagnarVolarus80: BC is Bis
[12:29:42] Ntertainment: then u have to pay taxes on everything
[12:29:48] Hamulon: that's aside from federal and CPP/EI
[12:29:50] Brotherjuggz: Its almost 50% and Alberta has no ales tax, but income tax is the same at 48%
[12:29:50] jofarrelldo: warlocks look soft this phase
[12:29:58] Nyk_Wyld: Provincial sales tax, or income tax?
[12:30:03] davoskaaaa: Good thing about living in Quebec is that we pay nearly 50% in taxes and the cost of living is so high that it cost about 20$ to get 3 chicken breasts KEKW

[12:30:11] Killpacko: Soul link??
[12:30:16] TheMadcapLizard: Haunt is nothing compared to starsurge
[12:30:19] cheetobbob: they need to buff druid starsurge 50%
[12:30:34] daget91: i pay about 20% only make 70K in Ontario
[12:30:39] crennerc: these numbers are totally made up
[12:30:43] crennerc: its like 30% avg depends on income
[12:30:53] sirdreadeye: @TheWhiteRabbitxX Saskatchewan can be bad.  it's been pretty mild
[12:31:01] Nyk_Wyld: I can claim tools now which is nice
[12:31:05] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV Watch out for the IRS monkaW
[12:31:06] Hamulon: Also Federal Canadian Tax on that amount is 31%, so in Nova Scotia that would be 50% even for JUST TAX. No CPP/EI, property tax, etc
[12:31:08] SpiteNL: taxmaxing
[12:31:10] thatsrealneeto: I don't file taxes lmao

[12:31:50] coiozzz: @Dewqt don't pay and keep your fingers crossed
[12:31:57] TheWhiteRabbitxX: @sirdreadeye to be fair, it was some small ass town called meadow lake in northern sask — in fact it was to visit the first girl I ever met online lmao… she told her parents we went to high school together, not met online. year was 1996
[12:31:58] running_backing: sounds like a tel aviv mini game
[12:32:03] skyzelol: the fact you have to file your own taxes in US is mad
[12:32:06] brutul_: Jokes on you, the billionaires pay 0%
[12:32:09] gordanon: lock very bad now?
[12:32:25] coiozzz: @skyzelol I'd take that over paying 45% by default, no matter the wage
[12:32:28] Vunoka: Anyone gonna watch AWC tonight? Gonna be fun
[12:32:30] davoskaaaa: @iknowido Thats what they make you think, they're doing so many work at once that they're not 100% focused on their job, they're just doing the 60% to get rid of the file and move on
[12:32:47] iknowido: i said good accountant
[12:32:54] stanleyxd27: literally just got a turbo tax add
[12:32:58] Bronsonchef: In other countries they just auto do it for you
[12:32:59] sirdreadeye: @TheWhiteRabbitxX LOL.   I live in Saskatoon.   been here for the best and Worst
[12:33:11] skyzelol: yeah that seems like a silly process - UK for example does it for you (including deductions), and if you want to contest it, you can
[12:33:25] j011yj0e230: tisms
[12:33:32] coiozzz: @skyzelol yea but you pay 3 times the amount
[12:33:35] TheWhiteRabbitxX: @sirdreadeye haha cool man. I actually would like to check out Canada again.. I was only 18 then.
[12:33:36] jamesQodex: You got some real German in you Dudu
[12:33:40] Humansoup: Ummm

[12:33:53] crennerc: @skyzelol I think the question is how that contesting process goes
[12:33:53] Humansoup: TRue
[12:34:00] Vunoka: Tax paying stream when?
[12:34:04] Vunoka: Would be fun
[12:34:08] avenomxx: thats why you tell them what's up
[12:34:09] Vunoka: Unironically
[12:34:10] jamesQodex: pretty sure ur wife loves when u do the taxes as well
[12:34:10] SippinSimpSyrup: you pay taxs?
[12:34:11] lilkreamys: could you get the epic bracers?
[12:34:12] AsilemxD: Do you have an accountant or you do everything your own?
[12:34:14] Teddsan: some countries have categories and just deduct based on that
[12:34:28] xalu_24: im getting the full boomy experience in STV right now
[12:34:29] sirdreadeye: @TheWhiteRabbitxX less guns, our priemier is like Trunp.....food is more expensive. other than that, we're all the same
[12:34:32] TheWhiteRabbitxX: there’s a non-zero chance you could just never file taxes and be good TwitchConHYPE
[12:34:52] TheWhiteRabbitxX: @sirdreadeye yeah I can see that
[12:35:04] skyzelol: @crennerc yeah but you dont start with 0 in the UK. they fill out the info for you and you can adjust
[12:35:04] AsilemxD: My sister is a CPA, It's definitely worth having someone double check it. But to each their own
[12:35:07] coiozzz: @TheWhiteRabbitxX that's the way to go about it
[12:35:14] Vunoka: Some Gov AI Tax Detection program is gonna fuck so many ppl who cheat with taxes soon.
[12:35:22] branyotv: i'm calling cap he doesn't do any of this
[12:35:35] brushbro: taxes in US LULE
