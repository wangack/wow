[0:47:03] TwicksTV: u still save like 45s rp / run time
[0:47:10] kj01a: oh but we're gonna try BloodTrail
[0:47:16] vellocets: seems like the requirements and execution are p high
[0:47:20] vellocets: and you need a warlock don't you
[0:47:22] explic_cit: Meeres assured they have no additional tacs for the globals
[0:47:23] vellocets: who tf plays warlock
[0:47:23] mrbonoso: i mean if you find the right comp to deal with the damage, why not?
[0:47:48] uniqueusername7: greg topping dps while dead
[0:47:54] shinta__: leggo diff
[0:48:02] TwicksTV: the same way
[0:48:03] TwicksTV: destro is still op
[0:48:04] blondie27mike: Your tanking in the mdi was great
[0:48:06] uniqueusername7: unholy not getting used even in MDI is proof that its doggy doo doo at the moment
[0:48:26] vellocets: can't wait to see it tried on a +30 and watching the healer insta die to their portal mage
[0:48:44] mrbonoso: has to be really innefficient for that big of a time save not to matter though
[0:48:48] uniqueusername7: "thats just because im dead" YEP
[0:48:57] drcausthiccc: xdd
[0:49:01] otmad: YEP
[0:49:02] manlyhandles: xdd
[0:49:03] Axestro: Grats on a great group play. Was very entertaining.
[0:49:05] flockheart: donki
[0:49:07] Yaumx: "Oh i'm dead" > old man growl clenches like never before
[0:49:29] uniqueusername7: these eles dont despawn even if you drop combat
[0:49:35] uniqueusername7: but they dont drop new droplets
[0:50:00] mrbonoso: Adge
[0:51:19] goop: where is the aura trackin the axe
[0:51:20] Aro725: wild to not press deaths advance lol
[0:51:34] MightyGIGACHAD: Lego acquired let’s gooo
[0:51:35] flockheart: RightThere
[0:51:53] goop: o idk ive never seen a str class
[0:51:57] buzzkill00: heyo dorki
[0:52:15] Aro725: so you dont have to move, I guess you dont need it. But i figured it would have to make it easier
[0:52:17] goop: dont even know what the axe does lol
[0:52:18] thendj: you can track how many mobs have the dot then try and only hit boss with the active for big funnel
[0:52:38] kj01a: it chops stuff
[0:52:44] boontactics: whats the purpose of popping the whelplings?
[0:52:47] manlyhandles: greg is gapping
[0:53:04] Drax_1224: @boontactics funnel
[0:53:08] kj01a: @boontactics funneling rescoures maybe
[0:53:10] Aro725: the adds might help greg more i think
[0:53:20] jakkal93: he is padding on whelps
[0:53:22] BLACKFOOT_TN: The Axe does frontal AOE and at the end is sends a slam or shockwave. It's great in large pulls. Not sure on what its cap is or if its capped.
[0:53:46] zymmac: enhance gets a lot of haste from adds
[0:53:51] danaxvx: is the dorki details profile available?
[0:54:08] danaxvx: I want to exclude damage done to non-important mobs
[0:54:10] goop: every time flame shock does dmg (capped at 6 targets) they get a stacking buff (up to 50) for their next lava lash
[0:54:11] Aro725: flame shock lowers the cd on lava lash and increases its damage done stacking a bunch.
[0:54:11] JustObSoLEET: its for cdr on his wolves / prim wave
[0:54:14] boontactics: oh gotcha..an enhance thing lol
[0:54:17] JustObSoLEET: works with his tier stack
[0:54:18] flockheart: Susge ?
[0:54:20] ActualTilt: pri wave lightning bolt gives haste
[0:54:22] JustObSoLEET: set
[0:54:31] JustObSoLEET: pri wave big haste on multi target
[0:54:32] goop: also primordial wave, every target w/ flame shock that gets lightning bolted = 10% haste
[0:54:47] danaxvx: if I can convince Ret players from spamming divine storm, my life will be better
[0:54:49] manlyhandles: florke oh fugma
[0:54:49] goop: so basically 6 targets = enh does infinite dmg
[0:54:54] kitty0chi: whats wrong with growls voice?
[0:55:00] kitty0chi: he sounds like he is sped up?
[0:55:05] Niaxlol: hey Dorki, do you by any chance know how crypticz has the special effect of the arcane mage hidden artifact permanentaly up? Would also like to use that, but did not find anything online
[0:55:06] jakkal93: he basically has lust all the time if he times pri wave correctly which i bet he does
[0:55:08] boontactics: nice..
[0:55:17] TBouse: i must be missing the infinite damage on that pull
[0:55:18] Aro725: @goop Correct, but only on 6 targets. Uncapped pulls enhance is ggs
[0:55:29] mrbonoso: KEKW
[0:56:12] goop: @goop ye thats why nobody played enh in mdi
[0:56:41] Aro725: Imagine if frost shock just hit all targets like secret tech? Holy enhance would be insane
[0:56:52] Aro725: well not all but square root scaled or whatever
[0:57:07] goop: lol they would just cast 50 stack lava lash every global and do x3 boss dmg of any other class
[0:57:13] kj01a: little harder than those 22s huh? LUL
[0:57:14] Aro725: LOL
[0:57:37] goop: donki HAH
[0:57:47] Aro725: was it mop when flame shock was uncapped? and you would just spam firenova for millions of damage. We need that back
[0:57:47] TBouse: that's a calculated AMS to prevent death from the dispel after
[0:58:22] trustnoonester: death strike the mofo
[0:58:26] goop: bro dorki was always fearing me on this boss too hes a menace
[0:58:39] TwicksTV: holy feed on the weak
[0:58:49] Aro725: o7
[0:59:02] Nnoggie: lichborne modCheck

[1:06:34] hivplus__: @dorki can you ask why kush was forced to rename from itsjoever
[1:06:35] kj01a: Because NAs Last Hope is a meme name, but Last Hope is an asweome name

[1:12:07] goop: grinding is fun stop trying to remove it
[1:12:07] alstadi: you'd be grinding live realms then, but getting annoyed by not getting the correct key at the same time
[1:12:19] uniqueusername7: @goop yes officer, this man right here
[1:12:31] Xyronic: grinding is fun when it has tangible rewards
[1:12:38] TripleXTN: grinding is only fun when you don't have a job

[1:35:44] BLACKFOOT_TN: I can't say I have too hard issues with Leggo's. My Hunter in SL got the lego bow first normal kill. Upgrade token first heroic kill after it can out. And my Aug got lego its first heroic kill.

[3:52:17] krispurrstv: @yohananya it's literally on top page of raider.io if you check lmfao
[3:52:32] Voorx18: why is greg doing 130k dps less overall? nerf spriest?
[3:52:54] misran: @Voorx18 he spent half the colossus pull walking back from spawn xdd
[3:52:55] heisakeeper: yohananya most of the comps you can find on raider.io or you think about what you need. You allways want prio dmg and uncapped aoe mixed together most of the times. So a group of this usually makes the best comps
[3:52:59] Zaisx: is it possible to balance spriest

[4:23:37] trustnoonester: maybe port a boss using a riftmage portal wink wink???
[4:23:37] Naowh: we actually had sub 8 atal easily
[4:23:37] bublzzzz: If I know two bosses in the mdi pool that you can tech such that you can do them together, is that useful tech?
[4:23:41] kaysiix: surprised u didn't snap any adds on priestess , i am sure there was some spot
[4:23:42] Hopefulx: @Naowh LOL

[4:29:18] zachl_: so like
[4:29:20] chubbytheboi: @Naowh Wonder who that was LUL

[4:29:24] leubinator: i wonder how mad the guy is who made all the rp in rise unskippable
[4:29:27] zachl_: idk maybe im trippin
[4:29:36] Big_hairy_moose: Bring back pulling the entire key in 2 pulls snapping everything onto a pixel pillar
[4:29:54] chubbytheboi: Jokes aside, the Rise tech was insane. I can't even think of how someone figures that out
[4:29:54] Xyronic: im pretty sure like 99% of what we did in legion still works in dht
[4:30:00] julian_fmv: What's the plan for fort + bolstering week? we quit wow and come back in a week or wut
[4:30:09] Hopefulx: @Xyronic old people who played legion with the advantage yet again
[4:30:18] anaya909: bring back the lock legendary ring so we can kite 90% of the trash in halls of valor
[4:30:18] tvilk: @Xyronic yeah ofc, they dont fix shit KEKL
[4:30:25] chubbytheboi: @Xyronic Didn't they fix the first boss high ground and other things?
[4:30:25] kaysiix: bro that atal sub 10 in BFA from echo is still the best MDI run , pulling every shit into rean
[4:30:26] GooseComics: @julian_fmv get gud. focus priority targets, and cleve the rest
[4:30:34] ItsYent: just snap everything onto oakheart ez

[4:32:33] Xyronic: bfa last season mdi xdd
[4:32:47] Xyronic: first 90% of dungeon is just clearing a path for your healer to kite awakened mobs during last boss
