[2:02:55] Q_TheDreamer: I sneezed and the 5 timewalking dungeons fell over
[2:03:19] AlphasaurusRexx: timewalkingn is never challenging. they did scale things wrong this time though which made it easier

[2:05:20] j_bar111: It sucks for casters to try and keep up with melee in TW because they just keep pulling
[2:05:22] Safirra89: also that trinket being broken really helps
[2:05:30] BlueBlurPrime: timwalking is really easy, only problem I had was grimrail, the 2nd boss, the fire he puts out from gun, is alittle strong
[2:05:34] Safirra89: it almost one shots boosses
[2:05:43] akia03: does your trinket work here again

[2:18:57] Billo0w: @PrincessAww you played it?
[2:18:59] TheCheeseWheel87: @Towelliee i believe Elvui will tell you the total of a currency if you change the type in the bottom right of your data bar of your screen
[2:19:05] Ezekyler: Throne and Liberty, the next WoW killer Kappa
[2:19:24] lgu4na: you would never fuilly quit though and lose all the progress youve put hundreds of hours of your life into
[2:19:28] akia03: riot is leadue?
[2:19:31] JasperCalico: @Billo0w don't know anything about it but like every other mmo it will die shortly after
[2:19:40] Quikbeard: No game will ever replace WoW and here is why. The raid/dungeon and overall combat is too good. New games will try to make something new instead of copy WoW directly.
[2:19:55] snake_like: wildstar combat 2.0 blease
[2:19:55] fun_with_yoyos: the horror of free to play
[2:20:03] Billo0w: @PrincessAww which mmo died really, except wildstar?
[2:20:08] GingerGambit: Atlas flashbacks
[2:20:22] Skylin3r: also they have the lore for an mmo
[2:20:36] ObsidianHealer: Or get something in Valo
[2:20:36] pixlbunz: There was a time when you could say that about Blizzard
[2:20:44] redspike15: @lgu4na more like thousands of days :D
[2:20:47] im_capy: Be interested in how the bot issue is handled in a Riot MMO, they are rampant in LOL and not just the official ones

[2:21:18] ElderTreefluff: wahoooo! just got my 3rd Lv70 character
[2:21:22] Krait06: so they also have a jailer?
[2:21:31] im_capy: a F2P game and bots just sounds like a bad time long term
[2:21:35] ItsGigg: Don't forget Arcane

[2:22:02] happyspot: but their jailer will be behind it all from the start Kappa
[2:22:04] firewalltwitch: Lore isnt very popular in league, they literally had to  force remove Lore from the monthly missions they had
[2:22:08] hddndoors: you got a good point
[2:22:10] NBK_Sethus: saw some forum posts saying that TW is overtuned. is it?
[2:22:12] Raxxiety: @Towelliee grimtrail depot sucks in timewalking
[2:22:22] canniik: Kind of ironic that League that started as a Warcraft mod and now they're looking at an MMO based off of that o.0
[2:22:25] ItsGigg: @Towelliee If you have the decoration of flame trinket, it is gigabusted in timewalking. It doesn't scale down the damage lol
[2:22:31] aumixp: @towelliee savedinstances can do it too
[2:22:31] corvicatz: saved instances does track it if you enable that currency in options
[2:22:41] polaropposite76: @Raxxiety did that this morning and we actually wiped on the cannon thing lol
[2:22:44] TheCheeseWheel87: @Towelliee i believe Elvui will tell you the total of a currency if you change the type in the bottom right of your data bar of your screen
[2:22:51] shapebender: you will prob have to log into each toon if you had it disabled ... you can just go to your current toon and hover over the currency
[2:22:55] Cabbageman007: Did you see Twitch is streaming a PG Onlyfans house starting tomorrow

[2:23:19] Scoodles91: have to log in once to get it working
[2:23:20] Forestrunner201: You need to go into each character to load it
[2:23:24] Sayryn: Is that a map feature that lines up all the addon icoons?
[2:23:25] Baneofall: you have to log on to the charater ti see
[2:23:27] AlphasaurusRexx: @canniik wasnt it DOTA that started as WC mod? league copied dota and made it better
[2:23:27] shapebender: it would have to been enable to track
[2:23:30] Lexi__Marie: go to your currency tab and hover over the timewarped badges
[2:23:41] Ezekyler: KEKW
[2:23:44] PvtHudson093: KEKW
[2:23:45] Incredible_Sausage: it has to handshake the data after you activate it LUL
[2:23:45] Bigbharash: open you currency tab
[2:23:46] taylorsdank: it keeps track from there if you did it from the start lol
[2:23:46] Baneofall: it will then keep track
[2:23:46] Scoodles91: you wont have to do it the next itme

[2:23:53] Forestrunner201: Once it is all loaded it works great
[2:23:59] largefromage: Jebaited
[2:24:00] Ertra: its a passive addon, it collects data overtime... its meant to be on in the background
[2:24:03] snake_like: it's not ideal, but altoholic makes that shit so easy for the future
[2:24:16] ShadoodHD: check the gold number at the bottom right
[2:24:26] canniik: @AlphasaurusRexx Ah yes, you're right, apologies

[2:35:22] Armdel: @soshiecho i mean unless they (or their friend) is lying, there is proof right there
[2:35:55] SlamNSalmon: @doughboi_trev I would believe that your friend looted tier gear, only because of the lower ilevel you indicated
[2:36:10] TheCliffyShow: Is Shadowmoon Burial Grounds still part of timewalking despite also being a m+ dungeon? That's weird.

[3:21:48] remixonfire91: 10% more dmg if no pet i personally dont mind poping my pet to lust dont see what is the big deal
[3:21:48] shapebender: restro shaman has been left behind and got no love ... like guard druid and feral druid
[3:21:48] gzus81: ive come across so many MM hunters who dont even have a lust pet
[3:21:53] monute316: lawls
[3:21:57] Jrdetsu: the pet actually does a nice amount of damage, so it's not really like a -10% penalty.
[3:22:00] Sollice: @DarthWrex Responded to the wrong person
[3:22:01] Prevention6: are bonus rolls for loot still a thing or did they get rid of that

[4:28:25] TheFox0228: The public without a minimum rank is the issue tbh
[4:28:27] cabalish: yeah for the quality is dumb
[4:28:28] bamojam: they let ppl take a work order that can't actually make it?
[4:28:31] Kratosjr1: there is a crafting website now to use
[4:28:33] MFAM_THE_Steven: you can put minimum quality on the work order so it doesnt flop less than what you want
[4:28:35] tronbadgames: @Towelliee whats the primal gem cut you need?
[4:28:38] Skylin3r: especially considering it's the only way to level some crafts
[4:28:41] tshafertv: security
[4:28:43] Masqerader: i can't complain about public orders, i make lariats all day
[4:28:49] EthicalHermit: The issue is the minimum quality doesnt matter on public work orders

[4:30:04] Kratosjr1: Check out the link
[4:30:25] RavingCultist: I believe they said there was an issue in use with having minimum quality requirements in Public orders that they needed to go to the drawing board on so they turned off that setting while they work on it and hope to bring it back in the future since everything else was working they way they wanted.
[4:30:25] Kratosjr1: it will bring up the server and person that can do it
[4:30:31] atsq1: I’m new to wow, is there a strat for sparks, valor and sockets? I haven’t spent anything and I’m ilvl 385

[4:33:21] TheDos13: @Prevention6 there's an NPC in the lower crafting area for this
[4:33:22] atsq1: Should I be using them? Or wait? @thedos13
[4:33:23] ClassicMalcontent: Currently the only way to max most crafting is with the choice of unlocking something worth crafting that you actually have materials or can afford to craft. Everything goes green or gray early. Only Alchemy did I get to 9 (then those discovery two turned gray). Others it's slower. For crafting and doing personal order for self or friend or two.
[4:33:36] akia03: @Prevention6 near tailoring bit
[4:33:37] Plague_GG: You can hide profession tools Ruby life poles
[4:33:51] Plague_GG: pools*

[4:34:50] ClassicMalcontent: @Mecabeast I think we've (most of us) have spent points in an non-optimal order. Even thinking I had an idea then re-reading and some adjustments meant, yep, working on switching to another branch of something.
[4:35:01] koko316: hey all

[5:53:24] Gezber: @MackPlays Right, but you need to fill the meter anyway. That's why I  was asking. Maybe they're harder
[5:53:40] CousinAvi86: @KittehKaos technically unlimited I believe, but obviously group damage taken and delt will create a soft limit.
[5:53:41] Gezber: @CousinAvi86 yeah
[5:53:42] MackPlays: Ah for meter yeah
[5:53:56] PhoenixVirusTV: awwww congrats

[6:06:04] anizzaofdoomhammer: I've got the BIGGEST BALLS OF ALL!!! <3 LUL <3
[6:06:05] Sneakiel0l: lol... again.. blizzard scaling and making sure these instances dont OWN you with bad balancing... GG
[6:06:10] Somakutala: They do
[6:06:14] lord_darkn: belfs have purge stack them
[6:06:16] Sneakiel0l: so bad...
[6:06:17] tylerwithghosts: Sure do
[6:06:25] Gillrad: DH, belf racial, priest, hunter, etc..
[6:06:53] salak_daddy: yea
[6:06:58] LX2_EXE: that's a huge problem
[6:06:58] omgitsbby: No
[6:07:00] Sneakiel0l: ITS A HUGE PROBLEM! that shouldn't be a thing..
[6:07:17] MackPlays: Every healer should have a purge
[6:07:20] KittehKaos: No, I wouldnt consider it a problem, I would consider it to be a mechanic you need to find a work around.
[6:07:24] Ardailec: If it's not a trash pack you can ignore I think it's a problem
[6:07:27] mavericks312: they will say just get good
[6:07:34] Gillrad: It's not more of a problem than certain classes having brez, lust, etc. and others not
[6:07:53] IDecayl: I think thats ok as long as its not only one  spec that has it. Kinda like lust if several classes have it I think its fine
[6:08:03] KittehKaos: @MackPlays yes I agree 100% every healer should have a purge its a basic part of being a healer/support
[6:08:08] Ardailec: Yeah but you can win without brez, lust and other utilities.
[6:08:10] Sneakiel0l: You shouldnt be required to have specific people in your group to do a dungeon... any makeup of any class or spec should be able to do ANY form of content... period.
[6:08:10] Luckydos: 🧐
[6:08:14] tylerwithghosts: It's not a problem if it's balanced correctly to not feel mandatory. I think it's fine if certain bosses reward certain abilities
[6:08:23] Meccka: Grab balls
[6:08:25] Ardailec: This is just "If you don't dispel this just hold this 80% damage L"

[6:50:50] Gezber: @coldarmorTBG oh man. so much time wasted going back and forth
[6:50:56] BettyBob: there was no update on SL for like 8 months lmap
[6:50:58] BettyBob: lmao
[6:51:00] Mortalmaster78: Tell me how brewmasters feeeel to you pls. Cause something feels off 😆
[6:51:05] LX2_EXE: 100% unsubbed SL because I didn't have 20 hours a week to play
[6:51:18] Bayne77: youre fucking wrong
[6:51:26] SundanceC: But the damn time gate on Sparks
[6:51:30] Ryenonn: When will Creation Catalyst come out?
[6:51:34] niels546: i have no tier and 3 389 crafted pieces, ilvl is 384, super happy
[6:51:45] Anderine: the primal chaos reqs are decidedly not casual friendly.
[6:51:47] Sneakiel0l: Creation Catalyst is like ... 3 weeks away
[6:51:54] ClayMatioNation: I appreciate your perspective
[6:52:05] Skylin3r: shit aint casual
[6:52:05] tiddlywarrior: @Anderine Yeah agreed
[6:52:06] Sutekiii: it's really nice that crafting is so relevant now though @Towelliee
[6:52:08] ohnot___her: 405
[6:52:12] stixxy23: 11-15 is not casual i dont think haha
[6:52:13] coldarmorTBG: @Gezber agreed.. fuck that haha
[6:52:14] Sneakiel0l: by next week... if you dont have your 4 piece... you wont be invited to anything
[6:52:29] NavalRainDrops: i didnt take my 405 or 408 pc this week to get my 2 pc set
[6:52:29] Skylin3r: m+ is not a casual thing
[6:52:33] polaropposite76: primal chaos is easy
[6:52:36] KittehKaos: If they can keep this pace they got 2 bosses down in under 10 minutes, they could clear in under 20
[6:52:36] Gezber: @coldarmorTBG shame too. it was a beautiful city
[6:52:40] ClayMatioNation: shadowlands for me was so obscure. like anima, soul cinders, etc. it was too much
[6:52:40] Redbearded16: @towelliee my man. Love to see it my dude. You’re slaying 💪🏼💪🏼
[6:52:42] SamuraiWillZ916: im at 305 i got a lot frm comp stomp
[6:52:44] taylorsdank: i have 2k right now
[6:52:47] taylorsdank: from dirt
[6:52:47] polaropposite76: the next step up is a different story
[6:52:51] SundanceC: I have tons of Primal Chaos..  Mettle is my short stuff
[6:53:11] strike879: after the raid is fully released the sparks are uncapped
[6:53:15] Davedaman26: I wish the primal chaos was account bound so that I can give it to toons that need it for professions
[6:53:26] xrandomdoodx: thundering such a bad affix, it should never require a weakaura to pug it lol
[6:53:33] Skylin3r: casuals go into m+ undergeared and can't even kill bosses, or take 1hr on a 30min key
[6:53:39] polaropposite76: it took me way too long to realize i needed to stand in the circles when he inhales
[6:53:45] JFeezy__: was watching the echo guys run 20s earlier and its just dumb how good hey are lol Even Naowh as prot was pulling like 140k average dps
[6:53:47] Gezber: @Davedaman26 100%
[6:53:51] KittehKaos: @Davedaman26 yeah it def should of been BoA not BoP
[6:53:57] ClayMatioNation: I never once unsubbed during WoD, but Shadowlands broke me.
[6:54:04] polaropposite76: low level m+ isn't any different than heroic imo
[6:54:08] LCDforever_: BFA was poo poo. I do think that Dragonflight is missing 'something' though.
[6:54:28] strike879: @Davedaman26 just send crafting orders from the alt to your main
[6:55:00] Skylin3r: i kept getting pugs the other day running 8-11 in the 360ilvl range
[6:55:11] KittehKaos: @GamerLCD Inclusivity for all classes in M+ and Heroic raids? XD
[6:55:24] Skylin3r: was runnin as tank
[6:55:27] propoopimus: bfa wasnt that bad, better than shadowlands and wod
[6:55:46] Endin: the damage is so low on the line that you just walk through it
[6:55:48] ClayMatioNation: fromage
[6:55:51] Davedaman26: @strike879 I would but some of my toons have about 80-90 of them and it would make sense to have them account bound to make it easier.

[6:56:09] JFeezy__: Last boss you just pull the boss to the otherside of the platform. The dot ticks for like 2 seconds and falls off. You don't dps the add just stay on boss the enire time
[6:56:13] SundanceC: The debuff from stepping in purple goes down whent eh adds vanish.. so it only ticks for 1-2 seconds instead of 15

[6:56:20] itsCloaker: tank boss at the opposite wall then walk through dmg
[6:56:51] Endin: literally thats it
[6:56:55] Endin: go through the wall fast
[6:57:06] IDecayl: yeah damage debuff oes away right when adds go away. So just take the debuff at the very end so you dont take a lot of the damage only some
[6:57:07] JFeezy__: no, end of the platform
[6:57:09] Spitviper51: dot goes away when adds disappear
[6:57:12] propoopimus: yes, what they are doing in 22+ also
[6:57:12] SundanceC: You get the dot, but it falls off when the adds disappear
[6:57:14] SC0REGASMS: it goes away after the phase is done
[6:57:15] NavalRainDrops: ya that dot is rough
[6:57:18] mavericks312: cant mages just blink thru it?
[6:57:46] Endin: move him as far away from the line as you can so the dot drops off right away

[6:57:52] KittehKaos: @GamerLCD the one thing I hate about WoW is classes just get left in the dust because they are not "meta" or players get booted or ignored cause of their iLVL or dps too low, instead of helping people just exclude them
[6:58:17] SC0REGASMS: well, other side from where adds spawn
[6:58:27] polaropposite76: lol i'd just rather kill the add
[6:58:39] LX2_EXE: banned
[6:58:45] Gezber: Same
[6:59:17] JFeezy__: @Darkaine2 with really high keys that adds like 12 millions dps to the fight
[6:59:39] polaropposite76: oof
[7:00:23] JaeDee: So it targets the furthest person away ?@towelliee
[7:01:20] Heero_Effect: Woah your still online

[7:02:06] Omenox: bremaster feel good in mythics??
[7:02:06] eggs_tyrone: didnnt they nerf tree again?
[7:02:12] MedicineMan: Do it
[7:02:14] propoopimus: tree boss Pog
[7:02:40] MedicineMan: Yeah they really nerfed the boss
[7:02:49] KittehKaos: for my key I got Acadamy +2 excited to try and get a group for today so I can get my grand vault quest done
[7:04:04] polaropposite76: all the m+ i've done I don't think i've ever actually used my own key lol
[7:04:41] GIJosh86: easier to just spam apply till you get accepted
[7:04:51] KittehKaos: if I dont I never get a group due to iLVL but can never get better ilvl cause no one will help out XD
[7:05:15] Kleva1: How did the SBG go?
[7:05:35] MedicineMan: +3 that ALG
[7:05:54] Ryqir: Dog cam? BibleThump
[7:05:55] Mr_Pennywise_: cohhBounce cohhBounce

[7:06:30] MedicineMan: Another reason why cats are better LUL
[7:06:43] superpudd: They just nerfed it right?
[7:06:46] mavericks312: mama didnt raise no punk bitch
[7:07:23] Skylin3r: was bigwigs updated for the change?
[7:07:23] mavericks312: the last boss is still free
[7:07:43] Skylin3r: o looks like there is a littlewigs update
[7:07:55] dmac614: free? lol no way
[7:08:00] tenaja22: If you get there it is lol
[7:08:56] tenaja22: people arent great at stacking those circles on last boss, they try to spread it around room and its toxic
[7:09:09] Jarlan23: you ever spell reflect that energy bomb back onto the boss and see your melee party members freak out bc of it
[7:09:16] Reckless_Monk: @Towelliee made my 405 Lariat Towellie.. rank 2 Diamond (expensive)

[7:10:06] Reckless_Monk: comission is crazy
[7:10:23] KittehKaos: in terms of Tanks I personally think its Warrior > DK > Pally > Druid > DH > Monk

[7:13:24] Jarlan23: bird boss can be a killer this week with storming
[7:13:24] mavericks312: the bird bos for sure cause ppl dont know how to do the orbs
[7:13:52] Redbearded16: Keg of the Heavens was my nickname back in high school
[7:13:56] zysmos: People have wiped so much on the tree boss everyone knows it so well now LUL
[7:13:57] LehBiscuit: 50% damage, healed for 66% damage. Icreased health by 6% damage up to 10 stacks
[7:14:05] REALPolarbeezy: @mavericks312 any orb on any boss causes people to tard out
[7:14:07] LehBiscuit: 66% damage==
[7:14:15] LeoricDidNothingWrong: Make spells dodgeable for brew
[7:14:16] fluh_: Keg Smash deals 50% additional damage, heals you for 66% of damage dealt, and grants 66% of damage dealt as maximum health for 10 sec, stacking up to 10 times.
[7:14:31] mischy_: They would be best tank in the game at that point lol
[7:14:41] KittehKaos: that is fucking broken lol
[7:14:51] mischy_: Yeah they need to increase magic stagger at the least
[7:15:02] fluh_: u can dodge the bleed peck from bird boss in AA

[7:15:10] gimmlay: I think cobalt assembly leveling is done .. I just went there and all the mobs are 70 and one shotting with me at 63
[7:15:11] NewWorldReign: why do you think they got rid of it, way too OP for tank spec
[7:15:15] NewWorldReign: ?
[7:15:19] mavericks312: no one is topping warrior atm stop it
[7:15:27] LX2_EXE: Why are people so afraid of tanks being better
[7:15:33] maane97: Replace nizo with keg of heavens
[7:15:36] mrderkleton: If stagger could include magic
[7:15:37] mischy_: That sounds like on big trash pulls they could be pushing BDK healing
[7:15:49] mavericks312: if the warrior nerfs dont come there gonna reign supreme
[7:16:03] MedicineMan: Where can I find that bingo chart? lol
[7:16:04] scalext: Still waiting for the class tuning pass, pray
[7:16:10] NewWorldReign: why do you think they got rid of it, way too OP for brewmasters?
[7:16:12] Katattakks: yeah there was an announcement that they're hotfixing the TW loot
[7:16:27] F00wway: just bring everything to warrior level
[7:16:27] Anderine: if they don't buff brew in the next tuning pass it's over
[7:16:29] oleohlsen: Haha, Nerf & Buff Bingo, what a cool idea!
[7:16:38] F00wway: with buffs
[7:17:57] MedicineMan: Fire/Frost mage need a good buff tho
[7:18:18] citrinecon: sup ill brb to watch you for sure
[7:18:24] Muglore: Anyone done Nokhud since the nerf? hows it feeling
[7:18:30] mavericks312: @MedicineMan alittle bit, i think more importantly arcane needs a nerf
[7:18:34] MedicineMan: Mages became rare this expantion
[7:18:51] Sadisticmedic: The Friend rank to Wrathion give a nice 389 Neck piece from the Quarter master
[7:18:53] KittehKaos: Prot Warrior needs a nerf, Frost/Unholy need a small nerf, Unholy is ridiculous right now.
[7:18:55] iunbearable: pally healing looks stronger then evoking healing.
[7:19:05] killsteventv: What nameplates are those
[7:19:05] MedicineMan: No mage main takes arcane seriously lol
[7:19:24] KittehKaos: @killsteventv plater I think
[7:19:26] fluh_: i dont think arcane needs a nerf when like 1% of the population can play it correctly to even touch dps numbers that big KEKW
[7:19:33] Maxoru0: unlucky combo lol
[7:19:41] mavericks312: @MedicineMan i mean maybe but arcane is clear and above the top spec for them if not all dps
[7:19:44] mikebarton89: how do i stop a raid lol didnt mean to bring this chat box up
[7:19:49] killsteventv: Thx @kittehkaos
[7:19:50] JRobezzz: @fluh_ agreed lol
[7:19:52] KittehKaos: @MedicineMan Arcane is like 3 buttons, 5 with CDs lol
[7:19:53] CMack_72: druid is probably soothing his own nerves after that pull
[7:19:56] mikebarton89: im a new to the community
[7:20:16] JRobezzz: @KittehKaos that's how it used to be, you have a lot of mandatory buttons now
[7:20:44] mavericks312: @KittehKaos arcane is like 6 buttons 8 with cds now
