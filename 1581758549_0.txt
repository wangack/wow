[0:46:02] chamberkill: @Rangerbob1921 yeah I agree, the problem is that in a mmorph enviroment if one class is outperforming others, you're isolating other classes cause u wont get invited to a key if you're not that specific fotm\

[0:46:49] chamberkill: @Rangerbob1921 and if you dont want to nerf the spec that 90% of tanks play, at least buff the others

[0:46:57] CrerisRs: @Rangerbob1921 the question is, why are ppl in +15s following a meta that is only forced on +30 keys
[0:47:03] Sebleh: @blackmaija it’s a standard JY strat for this boss. The bosses don’t jump away if you tank them in that corner but you still have to move out for the mega taze so they take the lock gates.

[2:06:37] Vranan: @KradishUK Echo timed a 31 upper fort in qualifier with 3 min remaining, maybe doable
[2:06:39] ModeraYsera: @izolate1 she had a diff event to do this weekend
[2:06:44] dragoon2k: not to mentiuon atm Echo has the best time in all dungeons
[2:06:48] brotan123: classic ResidentSleeper
[2:06:50] EzzLyfe: @Provision_ they can and they will, but do you think the other teams wont get any points during that time as well?
[2:06:51] sinful474: @EzzLyfe they havent even pushed upper yet
[2:06:54] kylito53: is that JPC from liquid?
[2:06:55] dragoon2k: except of course Upper which they havent gone into yet
[2:07:05] izolate1: @benevolentautoma  Sadge
[2:07:19] Hastif: I swear timer is not looking good for Ambition here
[2:07:19] scilla3497: @kylito53 Ambition is with Golden Guardians, but he raids with liquid
[2:07:20] EzzLyfe: @sinful474 yeah, they will spend 1 hr + in upper, during that time other teams will also be getting points.
[2:07:20] ma4celio: someone can explain me why they compet in old dungeons ? haven't played WoW since a long time
[2:07:22] phansk: @kylito53 yep
[2:07:32] ArnesMeyer: @kylito53 yup
[2:07:36] Provision_: @EzzLyfe well sure but echo also have very good times on their runs
[2:07:41] verybignice: who is winning
[2:07:41] picc0: @ma4celio these dungeons are part of s4 m+
[2:07:46] EightAte8: Manar

[2:07:51] skrillabilla123: its the shrouded buff
[2:07:57] sinful474: @EzzLyfe @me in 3h
[2:07:58] Iamcody4life: maner Pog
[2:07:59] Joebluntman: whats up with echo?
[2:08:01] EzzLyfe: @Provision_ true, but their lead isnt 3 points, it will be 1 point maybe, makign this a very close race
[2:08:02] Octem: mind your manners
[2:08:12] ma4celio: so every season they gonna bring some old dungeons now ?
[2:08:13] Dendii7: @Xyronic you hanging out with hana?
[2:08:15] rushplzz: they trapped elemental in sanguine, that's all
[2:08:16] EzzLyfe: @sinful474 you betting that echo will be 3+ up?
[2:08:17] JanDeGrote1: @ma4celio they are trying something new in season 4 brining some old dungeons back as M+
[2:08:22] certainlysteve: do ya have manar, son
[2:08:32] ma4celio: thats so cool !
[2:08:35] DryzTV: can you show monka??
[2:08:38] Provision_: @EzzLyfe that if Echo only does a 28 upper, if they get a 30 it will be even bigger
[2:08:39] Omnimorphic: barbLETSGO
[2:08:45] ma4celio: shadowlands dungeons were so bad
[2:09:05] moderatygos: i think they were good, but i also like the variety from s4
[2:09:11] krifdude: @ma4celio compared to karazhan and grimrail depot that isnt true at all
[2:09:12] DemonTatjik: @ma4celio BatChest
[2:09:17] B3nbu: some says it's cool, some say it's lame
[2:09:24] dragoon2k: remember all dungeons remaining atm is dungeons they wont time alot of the time the amount of points being collected tonight will be low apart for Upper
[2:09:29] Xyronic: @Dendii7 no i dont hang out with dumbos
[2:09:31] Boopmeep: i love grimrail depot and iron docks
[2:09:38] EzzLyfe: @Provision_ not really. if echo do 30 they get 30 points = 195 overall. They will need 1 hour for those 30 points, meaning other teams will get 2 points in that time too. so Ambition will at 193 or 194 even
[2:09:39] dragoon2k: For example I doubt any team will managed Lower 32
[2:09:42] Clairfoyance: @ma4celio saying this and then u play grimrail and iron docks LUL

[3:07:44] ChipJiggins: bear fans in shambles
[3:07:45] tangentbords_krigaren: @sarug You realize that saying math ain't real is the same as saying language ain't real right?
[3:07:49] EzzLyfe: @nteiras they tried it 3 times yesterday
[3:07:51] iqTron: echo lower 33??
[3:07:57] CrerisRs: @nteiras probably not, they have failed this key a couple of times today already
[3:08:02] hijaqt: think we will see a +33 lower from echo
[3:08:09] UpadlySzczurr: @tomassof they propably want 32 kara on last run beacouse timer

[3:08:38] Arvediu: @tangentbords_krigaren believe it or not math being real is an actual debate.
[3:09:04] Nathanonfire: arena tournys are boring its just a CC fest
[3:09:13] ifear_god: When rogues get a range spec?
[3:09:21] CrerisRs: @DOOGLEZZ Reading stream title is hard I guess
[3:09:44] Scotchy49: is it fortified only?
[3:09:44] Lizzerazu: Have Echo secured the win?
[3:09:48] Deviation_BigD: Pvp is the most boring thing to watch
[3:09:54] tangentbords_krigaren: @Arvediu A futile debate though as we can prove it is real by the fact hat it works 99.99% of the time.
[3:09:54] ssjbestsacjk: just dont die 4Head
[3:10:03] Sprayz4dayz: @ifear_god usually the answer would be 'when pigs fly' but for ~$20 you can do that :P
[3:10:11] ifear_god: @deviation_bigd you mean pve?
[3:10:37] IHateMy7elf: PvP is interesting to DO, but absolutly not to watch. :)
[3:10:43] pnavara: 2 mins fight for 3 stacks
[3:10:50] Deviation_BigD: @ifear_god nope u read it right, pvp is soooo boring to watch
[3:10:50] HampzWoW: Is this the last day?
[3:10:54] pnavara: not fun
[3:10:56] JanDeGrote1: @Lizzerazu right now they are ahead even if monka times this they would win the tie breaker but still plenty of time left

[3:11:13] izolate1: @IHateMy7elf  its coz shadowlands pvp. legion was very fun to watch imo
[3:11:34] Arvediu: @tangentbords_krigaren therefore its not provable. Like, don't get me wrong I do know math works and I trust the scientific method, just saying when you try to get deep into it, things aren't that clear. It's just a debate for fun though, nothing really relevant to the real world
[3:11:36] ifear_god: arena takes more skills than killing AI mobs
[3:11:52] methoduzz: LOL
[3:11:55] brotan123: gingi first blood? never seen it before
[3:12:03] chamberkill: @ifear_god damn thats some big insecure statement
[3:12:07] Nathanonfire: @ifear_god does not change the point that its still boring to watch
[3:12:12] IHateMy7elf: @izolate1 Yea, I remember that. But sadly it WAS, and now it shadiowlands so I am right.
[3:12:14] methoduzz: mobs that do 1400% more dmg/hp
[3:12:14] unholyhoit: @ifear_god spoken like a true 1300 hero
[3:12:17] JanDeGrote1: @ifear_god you would think so KEKW but i have seen blizzcon champs try to do mythic raiding and M+ and that stuff was not hot
[3:12:18] Deviation_BigD: @ifear_god like i said it is hella boring to WATCH
[3:12:24] ModeraYsera: This isnt an argument that we need to have GoodTake
[3:12:30] Lizzerazu: @JanDeGrote1 How about break timers?
[3:12:50] beadiiee: @ifear_god if its boring, dont watch it:)
[3:12:52] Nathanonfire: mods detected too much fun in chat
[3:13:00] CrerisRs: @benevolentautoma you dont like discussing philosophy of math? LUL
[3:13:07] izolate1: @IHateMy7elf  next awc tourney is in dragonflight so lets Prayge its good again
[3:13:10] HampzWoW: Is this the last day to push?
[3:13:15] Sprayz4dayz: they both require different skillsets both are impressive in different ways :)
[3:13:22] billabong212: Ambition +2 30 upper?
[3:13:25] heyitsferris: @benevolentautoma Mathnos vs. Xyience
[3:13:26] snorrow92: @HampzWoW yes
[3:13:31] Deviation_BigD: @ifear_god and yea why r u here if u dont like it, go watch someone else lol
[3:13:32] iqTron: why ambition isn t doing yard 37 with this timing on 35?
[3:13:51] Lizzerazu: @HampzWoW Yes. ITs the last day.
[3:13:51] assrug: billabong212 maybe but not likely
[3:14:00] moohuu: @benevolentautoma XD
[3:14:04] sinful474: they struggled with it yesterday
[3:14:07] tangentbords_krigaren: @Arvediu i really don't see your logic on that one though. By proving it works you say it cant be proven? How does that work? it's a paradox at best. and i do get what yo mean it just doesn't make any sense to say it cannot be proven by the fact that it can be proven.
[3:14:09] ModeraYsera: @benevolentautoma I was referring to the "x is boring to watch" argument that was going back and forth, lol
[3:14:13] CrerisRs: @benevolentautoma Xy'Ro..the cartel wins again
[3:14:16] Nathanonfire: @iqTron id put money on it that ambition cant do a 37 JY
[3:14:49] Deviation_BigD: @ifear_god umm im gonna leave u there lmao Pepega
[3:15:03] TCGRebel: @EzzLyfe he cant, hes a mod.
[3:15:04] raikoneN_: 32 uppr!?

[3:15:45] iqTron: zaelia in seed
[3:15:54] catboysanji: echo almost wiped and we cut away!
[3:15:59] darawsha94: @munkz8 they're fully geared
[3:15:59] Restosaur: echo messed up
[3:16:16] KradishUK: Can we get vision on Echo?
[3:16:17] Arkshol: @tangentbords_krigaren there is actaully postulates about that thing, so what he said holds some tru for example you will never know certainly if maths are consistent or if you can prove theorem
[3:16:30] moohuu: @munkz8 308 ilvl and selfCD helps a lot
[3:16:32] NTeiras: why is the boss spammin armor ?
[3:16:33] snorrow92: echo wipe
[3:16:41] Shearin77: echo wiped
[3:16:43] Restosaur: echo wiped
[3:16:43] JMPanamos: well
[3:16:53] Nox1o: Come on production. We missed echo wipe
[3:16:53] OnlyABanana: echo wipe
[3:16:57] thorius: How did the lock not get interrogated?
[3:17:03] Nox1o: what is this
[3:17:03] Arkshol: @tangentbords_krigaren this video actually explains it in a good manner
[3:17:04] Nathanonfire: casters slippin
[3:17:06] meak3st: and we're missing the final boss for ambition??
[3:17:15] Sprayz4dayz: would be cool if we could swap armor sets in m+ runs, to see just how far players could actually push
[3:17:17] ifrel: whu did they switch to small, in that moment?
[3:17:19] TCGRebel: @Kalyssa94 or let them run it how they want too? its their tournament
[3:17:22] Christrife1: caster so slow
[3:17:22] Sleepypan: oh noo
[3:17:30] assrug: if you are seriously discussing what can and can not be proven by math in twitch chat in a wow channel at sunday 10pm
[3:17:34] epilold: Hello production???!!! Why not showing echo on fullscreeb when they do curator 31+????!!!!
[3:17:37] Sleepypan: @Sprayz4dayz like the good old legion days
[3:17:37] printfworld: 5 point LUL
[3:17:41] assrug: you are not investing your energy wisely
[3:17:42] GoGoGarrett: wish it was the old overwatch league, where we can watch which ever stream we want, and still listen to the casters
[3:17:47] speedy__ttv: @Sprayz4dayz we were able to do so in legion ,they changed it afterwards
[3:17:47] Nathanonfire: @ifear_god and do less DMG? lol ok guy
[3:17:50] tangentbords_krigaren: @tangentbords_krigaren I have seen it but prefer watching Brian Cox or other established and accomplished people in the fields of science. Too many of Veritasiums videos have so many flaws.
[3:17:53] bizzenwow: Pump
[3:17:54] Arvediu: @tangentbords_krigaren i'm not a huge expert on math philosophy but it's a very interesting field if you want something fun to think about. But basically even the most obvious things can't 100% be proved which leads to fun thoughts.
[3:17:57] Dwealing: These hunters smh ;)
[3:17:59] epilold: Seriously spectator fail
[3:18:01] FocusDistract: jpcDeplete
[3:18:17] Civilsyclar: What about the Echo wipe?
[3:18:24] moohuu: @tangentbords_krigaren math is a language to describe things. as any other langue it is not fix and will always somewhat flawed. nothing there to fix that (at least, not to day)
[3:18:32] jasonshenTFT: ambition probably starts on 37 now right?

[4:06:21] moderatygos: they may be on break before starting it though
[4:06:27] CrerisRs: @nteiras whos coping with what, it is mitigation, albeit not as good as raw armor because parry is rng so even with 80% parry you can die to 2 unparried hits

[4:11:37] kimohunt: if you want to play non meta classes, just dont expect you will get invite in a lot of keys cause people are weird. but push up your own keys is definitely no an issue. got 2k6 as havoc and 2k5 as feral last season. meta class = make your life easier but not 100% a must to do m+
[4:11:38] Rofyx: @omniscientautoma but 3k was not even close to seasonal reward of 0.1% which is just filled by meta specs only, when the #2000 warlock worldwide is higher than #1 of other specs
[4:11:40] Sleepypan: still people implying that u cant pug as a non meta spec @Umonkedup like there is people out there blaming mdi for the fact they cant even do a 10
[4:11:51] yuriblack99: @omniscientautoma spriest
[4:11:51] NotAnthiel: man yall care too much about whats being played in keys none of us will ever touch. just enjoy the game. lets just deplete our 15's and move on

[4:12:49] unholyhoit: @NotAnthiel imagine if people were like that with F1 races and everyone tried buying an F1 car to get their commute? LUL
[4:12:54] Nidalee55: people complaining about meta should just run their own keys or make some friends
[4:13:03] Gillettefuzionz: @solorscape catch up?

[4:13:53] unholyhoit: @hulkomania why isn't your car being used in a race? does that feel bad? LUL
[4:13:55] pmisterd: the expectation that you should be able to get the rank 1 dungeon title as just any spec any time is silly people dont get rank 1 glad or hall of fame on non meta specs unless they are the best players in the world lol
[4:13:58] Gillettefuzionz: @solorscape unheard of teams? are you insane
[4:14:06] mr_jimbone: WICKED

[4:14:11] Neckromantic: @tettles u could link yer b-net accounts so you share mounts
[4:14:19] zacaries_: They need to make the mouse mount from HS Mercs be able to fly
[4:14:22] eggman_br: ok, lets compromise. We stop talking about meta and mods gives us all Beta keys
[4:14:24] NicklasJ92: was it the same bike coming through?

[4:16:33] Ivyylove: alright, then how is saying that you want to be a desk, insulting people. In this case, banning me for saying i wanna be a desk (therefore all the ppl who want to be desks) is hate towards this group of ppl!!
[4:16:34] unholyhoit: @Oaex11 I've talked about NA all stream and not one timeout, maybe it's something else getting you in trouble

[4:42:56] dkwarrior4: Echo doing the same gambit? O.O

[5:05:55] Omnimorphic: echo has to go 33 gambit
[5:06:04] Provision_: @Omnimorphic that where this get interesting, echo has quicker keys so they have more room to push.

[5:07:03] yanisha69: SHOW ECHO OR MONKA!
[5:07:05] Mipolol: KEKW
[5:07:05] Rtrain: the fact the best play here is to wait for the timer to tick all the way down before starting a key is kind of funny.
[5:07:05] fremen14: @production pls show monka and echo split screen
[5:07:06] B3nbu: why show last place, no one cares
[5:07:06] moderatygos: slappers only, license to kill

[5:08:08] YuriyMeln: lol, echo just waisted time doing this 32

[5:08:31] beadiiee: @Conec123 because all teams deserve to be shown
[5:08:39] ArzaSpeGlacon: If they both time and Monka is 3 minutes ahead, they'll win too!
[5:08:40] darawsha94: Echo were always faster on gambit no matter what key level it was
[5:08:41] KrADishgB: @YuriyMeln Or maybe Echo realises that 33 gambit is high failure rate and chances are neither of them times it, then the tie break matters
[5:08:42] Provision_: @YuriyMeln they need to be more risky yeah. Also less deaths
[5:08:42] Rhiux: @YuriyMeln no they didnt
[5:08:43] Lorans_TV: split screen echo and monka @Warcraft

[5:09:23] Rezzpectable: is maystine playing venthyr?
[5:09:31] bloddbear: @khyiror_ Moadmoad died due to some mobs seeing an imp from one of the warlocks, but they managed to fix it, so nothing really happend
[5:09:33] Provision_: @KinarPT no, they force monka to do a higher key, since they win with tiebreaker
[5:09:38] zacaries_: Dratnos just jinxed it Sadge
[5:09:41] pmisterd: @KinarPT they likely wouldnt have been able to do another key after the 33 gambit anyway so it was a good warmup/tie breaker secur

[5:10:10] YuriyMeln: @KrADishgB I'm not sure why this 50 seconds that they got matters. If I were from echo I would think that only thing that monka can do is try to push higher key, so you should either
[5:10:10] NTeiras: impossible
[5:10:11] ponzudream: how do u even stun 3 scalebinders
