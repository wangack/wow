[2:47:19] oshiyi999: tbh i never felt like undead had enough character types
[2:47:30] oshiyi999: they all always looked the same and equally creepy n boring
[2:47:31] Wooshu: They are the same
[2:47:40] oshiyi999: i was ok w more style on em!!!
[2:47:52] oshiyi999: blood elf was ok tho
[2:48:23] oshiyi999: BE coulda stayed the same BUT if u added that much style to undead n shit leaving other races the same as before would have been crazy!!!
[2:48:35] oshiyi999: im a designer so i understand the struggle of changing 1 thing. now u gotta change everything
[2:48:50] oshiyi999: if i change one of my flyers or something, i gotta change all of them and update. not just one

[2:50:42] Zefior: gnomer is harder than anything in era wth are you talking about HUH
[2:50:56] Wooshu: the double xp is a joke, I called 25-40 being a slog and not many people doing it
[2:50:59] AfroManHamro: only thing that turned me off from SoD was how PvP heavy it was based, but thats just me. im a PvE Andy SoD is still lit
[2:51:05] Wooshu: they realized that and Blizzard gave them a hand
[2:51:13] Wooshu: in ERA and HC, no handouts

[2:53:07] AfroManHamro: and no knowledge of the raid, Naxx in classic now is dumb easy

[2:53:58] N30V3N0M: How are you?
[2:54:08] AfroManHamro: @Wooshu that was the main concern i had about it. they pretty muched cucked the people who already leveled but then again SoD isnt going to last longer than a year so
[2:54:31] cosmin284: heartBeat fuegoRizz
[2:54:41] cosmin284: Nessie
[2:54:48] Zefior: @Wooshu its a seasonal server im not fan either, i think they should have waited for phase 3 before giving us the buff but meh ... i dont feel too strongly about it
[2:54:49] N30V3N0M: I need to get into SoD
[2:55:06] SzSwordzero: Not me rich voschHEHE
[2:55:07] N30V3N0M: NA, mostly Retail
[2:55:10] Wooshu: @Zefior it made the game too easy which turned me off from SoD
[2:55:15] Wooshu: Im back in HC again
[2:55:30] Renfuryy: it was okay, its raining madge
[2:55:34] oshiyi999: if u put ur legs up on a wall lying down ull feel better

[2:55:43] oshiyi999: our do ankle circles w ur feets both ways
[2:55:50] oshiyi999: i do 12 in each direction
[2:55:50] N30V3N0M: Hogwarts Legacy*
[2:55:53] Renfuryy: are you going to be raiding? or can I join you?
[2:56:20] SuperLintendo: TwitchConHYPE
[2:56:43] SzSwordzero: Legacy done
[2:56:44] oshiyi999: usually stretching, either static or flow motion (BAck and forth), releases lactic acid
[2:56:55] oshiyi999: so there is bodybuilding, and yoga. these can b 2 diff types of movement
[2:57:04] oshiyi999: bodybuilding is usually about strenght. yoga about relaxing
[2:57:20] Renfuryy: ill fly to astranaar
[2:57:50] SzSwordzero: I'm normal without working üí™ lol
[2:58:02] psychodarius: whats the server plz?
[2:58:09] cosmin284: Vibe
[2:58:20] oshiyi999: so there is something called fascia
[2:58:25] oshiyi999: this is the SURFACE of ur muslce
[2:58:34] oshiyi999: very very top like last 1/8 inch of muscle is called fascia
[2:58:46] oshiyi999: this is what ACTUALLY stretches during yoga!!!
[2:58:56] oshiyi999: it is also what PROTECTS u from injury!!!
[2:59:05] SzSwordzero: Not muscle üò´
[2:59:10] SzSwordzero: Lol
[2:59:11] oshiyi999: having LONG fascia (stretched) is what makes it so that ur muscles DONG tear
[2:59:26] N30V3N0M: I enjoy it a lot, it feels very lively even though it is a single player game
[2:59:26] oshiyi999: this is contrary to popular belief which teaches that stretching ur "MUSCLE" is bad
[2:59:30] ill3stdrew: muscle dong
[2:59:36] oshiyi999: the REALITY is that u are not stretching ur MUSCLE but ur FASCIA
[2:59:38] oshiyi999: :)))
[2:59:45] oshiyi999: i do this for a living. happy 2 teach!!!

[3:01:09] oshiyi999: ANOTHER myth is that u MUST stretch for pain. totally untrue. multiple options for multiple peoples.
[3:01:28] oshiyi999: ANOTHER option for calf pain is to simply focus a BIT harder on ur hamstrings.
[3:01:41] oshiyi999: perhaps just 12 reps of butt kicks on each side added to ur routing could help a LOT
[3:01:50] Wooshu: ok im simmered down thinking of how casual SoD is now

[6:28:44] treviheat: LETSGO
[6:28:52] Fennyyy: yall bathing in that fire
[6:29:01] stephens99: peepoCheer
[6:29:02] polabear209_: just have that lock sit there and kill bombs and spam searing pain
[6:29:06] polabear209_: much easier
[6:29:07] LTDE_Ginto: why your meta lock dont kill bombs ?? its his job LUL
[6:29:19] polabear209_: lol idk why he taunted the boss and got clapped
[6:29:20] Bayord: scorch the bombs
[6:29:20] treviheat: !desi
[6:29:42] polabear209_: put lock on bombs
[6:29:46] Auphyr: at least we'll always have catHips
[6:29:54] polabear209_: searing pain
[6:29:58] Arriv003: Anyone got some fire resist elixirs for the tank?
[6:30:00] Bayord: they die in 1 scorch
[6:30:06] Pyroheet: 1 Arcane blast should kill them
[6:30:07] polabear209_: lock doesnt tank boss
[6:30:12] neuronicall: Get someone else to tank boss
[6:30:21] treviheat: xffshrug
[6:30:22] LTDE_Ginto: of course its his job (its mine in guild), the lock can use Searing pain as an instant
[6:30:26] Pyroheet: i mean explosive
[6:30:29] cosmin284: Nessie
[6:30:30] Bayord: ice lance
[6:30:39] Pyroheet: yes
[6:31:10] Pyroheet: they will be like 3 of them 1 AE will kill tem
[6:31:18] polabear209_: lock just spams searing pain and 1 shots bombs all fight
[6:31:25] polabear209_: or w.e ther instant cast is
[6:31:47] LTDE_Ginto: if you have 1 tank, the lock yes its difficult. The lock in this raid is the off tank and he must manage bombs, he dont have to dps the boss. Its a survival fight, not a dps check
[6:32:10] Todd686: bombas
[6:32:47] MindWaveGG: #showtooltip  /cleartarget  /tar Incendiary Bomb  /tar [dead][noexists] Frost Bomb /tar [dead][noexists] Radioactive Bomb  /cast Searing Pain

[6:35:02] Todd686: worried
[6:35:02] Bayord: tank needs to try not to get stacks and kite the flame
[6:35:03] Renfuryy: madcat

[6:35:10] cosmin284: Cheergi
[6:35:14] Dynamics831: fuegoKek
[6:35:16] LTDE_Ginto: and even without macro, if the lock stand in front of the pilar and the boss is at his back, if you press Searing pain, the target will dont be the boss but add in front of you -> bombs automatically
[6:35:16] shadotdow: fucking shit

[8:42:16] Todd686: The terms "red pill" and "blue pill" refer to a choice between the willingness to learn a potentially unsettling or life-changing truth, by taking the red pill, or remaining in contented ignorance with the blue pill.

[8:53:15] BigMevans: so red pill is a choice of action?
[8:53:30] Arthident: blue pill is to not even be aware that something could be wrong
[8:53:38] cosmin284: gremlinNODDERS
[8:53:45] Renfuryy: if you already know, its red pill, even if you dont do anything

[9:08:49] Renfuryy: IHaveAQuestion
[9:08:57] Todd686: IHaveAQuestion
[9:09:00] zefinitv: healer mage is arcane
[9:09:00] Pyroheet: its the same
[9:09:08] Pyroheet: no no heal and fire
[9:09:10] Pyroheet: is different
[9:09:56] Todd686: docnotL
[9:09:56] Altoar: level another mage Blindge
[9:09:57] zi0qt: resepec is 1 gold cap
[9:09:58] Pyroheet: becuase healing mage is like disc priest in retail the more dmg you do the more heal you do
[9:10:01] Zefior: big dam button LETSGO
[9:10:11] feihTV: It's a rogue rune
[9:10:26] feihTV: The tree stump has a trap that you have to disarm
[9:10:54] Todd686: pressing buttons in wow Suffering
[9:10:56] Zefior: and re-gear
[9:10:56] zi0qt: Get an addon called "Talented"
[9:11:05] DesiHeat: aaAAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAa
[9:11:06] Todd686: madcat
[9:11:14] zi0qt: aaAAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAa
[9:11:19] zefinitv: lol
[9:11:32] Altoar: wideSmadge
[9:11:48] Zefior: WoW is the kind of game that without addons everyone would stop playing docShrug
[9:12:02] cosmin284: gremlinNODDERS
[9:12:02] Arthident: rage
[9:12:09] Todd686: GOTTEM
[9:12:10] mandito_: kermitNODDERS
[9:12:17] zefinitv: they should ban addons :3
[9:12:20] mandito_: undiscovery-like
[9:12:22] Zefior: sooooo you want retail features heh Hmmm
[9:12:23] zi0qt: the addon lets you save different specs and auto picks it for you when you respec. Less clicks :)
[9:12:30] Todd686: fuegoPout
[9:12:33] Altoar: DuckMadge give dual spec DuckMadge
[9:12:40] cosmin284: yes
[9:12:47] zi0qt: Why Respec costs 1gold instead of 50 gold KEKW
[9:12:47] Zefior: current retail system would be better
[9:12:49] andyjamesgames: WE WANT DUAL SPEC. WHEN DO WE WANT IT ???? WE WANT IT RIGHTFUCKING NOWWWWWWWWWWW
[9:13:05] Todd686: perhaps you need to discover patience grogu
[9:13:10] mandito_: blizzard is about to discover your foot in their ass over duel spec
[9:13:22] zefinitv: I agree, if we had the retail client and options in classic would be great
[9:13:52] Todd686: dragonflight spec? GETOUTTAHERE
[9:13:59] Zefior: Multiple-Fuego-Spec DonkSass
[9:14:00] Arthident: AAAA LET HER COOK AAAA
[9:14:20] Todd686: is this a common problem, wow players not wanting to press buttons too much? Hmmm
[9:14:25] zefinitv: dont forget getting all spells out of the spell book again
[9:14:43] Zefior: @Todd686 it is objectively better is it classic though thats debatable
[9:14:50] andyjamesgames: just role 3 mages Kappa one for each spec Kappa
[9:15:10] Todd686: oh yeah i jsut meant calling that name would be terrible keking @zefinitv
[9:15:14] Todd686: @Zefior
[9:15:16] cosmin284: kermitNODDERS
[9:15:24] andyjamesgames: "we boosted XP by  100%. just roll 3 mages Kappa " - Blizz, probably
[9:15:26] Todd686: how are there 2 zefis
[9:16:04] andyjamesgames: you know thats what theyre thinking lol
[9:16:06] Zefior: just type all your spells via chat commands noobs DonkSass
[9:16:12] andyjamesgames: LUL
[9:16:15] Pyroheet: omg really
[9:16:16] Zefior: git gud DonkSass
[9:16:18] zefinitv: nooo
[9:16:19] Renfuryy: thats not a good solution keking
[9:16:21] mandito_: you're becoming unhinged
[9:16:24] bassey_: level a warlock
[9:16:25] Renfuryy: youd have to gear it too
[9:16:31] prfssrzaddy: Content KEKW
[9:16:35] Todd686: it is?
[9:16:35] andyjamesgames: @Renfuryy WE KNOW ITS NOT SO GIVE US DUIAL SPEC HOLY FUKCK
[9:16:37] mandito_: fuegoGaming
[9:16:37] andyjamesgames: AAAA
[9:16:37] DesiHeat: apeStare
[9:16:38] andyjamesgames: a;sldkfja;soldkfjasdf
[9:16:45] Renfuryy: id rather them put dual spec in the game
[9:16:57] andyjamesgames: WE KNOW
[9:16:58] Todd686: and a third mage for the weekends
[9:16:59] andyjamesgames: lmao
[9:17:00] andyjamesgames: asd;lhjasdf;lkjhasdfl;kjhsadf
[9:17:07] feihTV: Desi, important question. If you were a fruit, what fruit would you be and why?
[9:17:13] Renfuryy: would you recommend I make another priest to play shadow? keking
[9:17:19] Todd686: 7 mins? port to IF
[9:17:23] Todd686: catLeave
[9:17:38] Arthident: @Renfuryy OOOO perma shadow ren ? wtfwtfwtf
[9:17:41] mandito_: good song. woah
[9:17:47] mandito_: got me groovin'
[9:18:03] Zefior: ok HOW would YOU do it if dual spec was not an option AND the retail version could not be used as is, thats something that classic devs are asking themselves im sure
[9:18:11] mandito_: desi... ez answer
[9:18:11] zefinitv: it's very difficult question
[9:18:14] mandito_: you'd be a "cutie"
[9:18:25] Todd686: strong and delicious wtf
[9:19:08] feihTV: It's really difficult, good answer. I respect and salute you for choosing the green apple
[9:19:13] Renfuryy: It is an option
[9:19:16] Renfuryy: xffshrug
[9:19:23] Pyroheet: alright i will catch you guys later fuegoVanish
[9:19:40] Arthident: @Pyroheet bye frenn catHug
[9:19:41] Zefior: yes and they changed it, why ?
[9:19:48] mandito_: so they could xffing in the office
[9:19:52] zefinitv: i don't think we have #nochanges nerds in sod anymore so i don't see why not
[9:19:57] cosmin284: @Pyroheet fuegoPeace frenn fuegoLove
[9:20:28] prfssrzaddy: Not sure who asked for boosted exp or reduced mount cost but everyone wants dual-spec
[9:20:28] Todd686: madcat
[9:20:45] mandito_: zefi is over here drinking the kool-aid
[9:20:50] mandito_: lmao
[9:20:58] cosmin284: Vibe
[9:21:08] Todd686: cosmin just out here vibin
[9:21:09] Todd686: Vibe
[9:21:14] mandito_: @Todd686 ikr
[9:21:59] cosmin284: heartBeat Heartgers fuegoL fuegoH fuegoLove
[9:22:05] mandito_: anyone who has played this game for 20 years wants duel spec
[9:22:06] Renfuryy: either is fine imo, anything that's not having to respec and use multiple addons to try to make it not Suffering
[9:22:16] mandito_: and anyone who has played for 20 days wants duel spec
[9:22:19] cosmin284: yes
[9:22:39] zefinitv: i want dual spec, boosted xp and cheap mount o/
[9:22:50] Todd686: gold sink, more gold farmers and buyers Aware
[9:23:10] Ecamam: OMG 1g thats way to much LOL :)
[9:23:16] cosmin284: kermitNODDERS
[9:23:29] mandito_: they're waiting to give it to you later. that way they look like a hero
[9:23:30] Todd686: need quad-spec kermitNODDERS
[9:23:31] SikEo_88: i agree that dual spec will be a great addition to the game, but thinking it will fix the tank and healer shortages is cap
[9:23:38] bassey_: feral/boomy
[9:23:46] mandito_: @SikEo_88 good point.
[9:23:47] zefinitv: just wanna vibe in sod, if i want hardship i'll go play hardcore selffound
[9:23:56] maxwell_werkstrand: @DesiHeat ofc, i know what you mean since minute 1 :D
[9:24:08] Todd686: just gimme it madcat
[9:24:18] Renfuryy: tank/heal shortages are in every version of the game, these are just roles people prefer less
[9:24:32] maxwell_werkstrand: @DesiHeat yeah dual spec have to come. Nonsense it isnt i game alrdy
[9:24:36] prfssrzaddy: Maybe we just need to discover it Kappa
[9:24:45] SikEo_88: its one the talking points ive seen across various platforms
[9:24:50] SikEo_88: didnt mean to imply you had said it
[9:24:55] Todd686: guys are we fixing wow?
[9:24:59] bassey_: like me I'm soul link pvp main but i have to go destruction for raiding
[9:25:08] SikEo_88: FYI im a healer main, always have been
[9:25:11] Renfuryy: it could help in the sense that someone can have a healing offspec without it being inconvinent, but its not going to make people enjoy healing who dont already
[9:25:42] m0ndan0: Maybe they are saving Dual Spec for lvl60? it makes sense
[9:25:45] Todd686: dont go to those lands, they're bad worried
[9:26:01] Zefior: not always but thinking like a dev is analyzing a problem, analyzing why past solutions weren't good enough, coming up with solutions hopefully better ones, and if you are a really arrogant dev just scrapping everything and replacing it with something else its not that simple, you also have to go through 100x meeting and getting your ideas approved, its a pain, fml madge
[9:26:11] Todd686: not always but thinking like a dev is analyzing a problem, analyzing why past solutions weren't good enough, coming up with solutions hopefully better ones, and if you are a really arrogant dev just scrapping everything and replacing it with something else its not that simple, you also have to go through 100x meeting and getting your ideas approved, its a pain, fml madge
[9:26:12] cosmin284: gremlinNODDERS
[9:26:20] Zefior: blizzard is like the government it doesnt move fast
[9:26:22] SikEo_88: @Renfuryy yep, people who dont like healing aren't going to suddenly  start healing because they can have 2 specs - DPS players will just have 1 PvP and 1 PvE spec
[9:26:33] Ecamam: People prefer tank / heals less as they don't want to deal with the blame culture that has evolved into the game, DPS NEVER do wrong, in my 18 years of experience its 95% the dps fault when things go wrong in an instance
[9:26:57] Todd686: YEP COPIUMSHIPMENT
[9:26:57] Fossabot: YEP
[9:27:00] Zefior: LETSGO
[9:27:02] Renfuryy: id hope its before 60, 60 will be nearing the end of sod
[9:27:10] Arthident: catAsk can you clip that for us ?   @DesiHeat
[9:27:14] Renfuryy: @SikEo_88 yes exactly
[9:27:32] SikEo_88: @Ecamam as someone who has healed at basically every level in every expansion - this is true
[9:27:35] Todd686: are you guys watching Ren on his mount? CatDriving
[9:27:43] Arthident: CatDriving
[9:27:52] maxwell_werkstrand: dont forget about phase at 60
[9:27:57] DesiHeat: CatDriving
[9:27:59] Todd686: keking
[9:28:03] maxwell_werkstrand: we got phase to get 60, and the last phase is after it
[9:28:19] Arthident: WHOA
[9:28:23] Todd686: IHaveAQuestion
[9:28:23] cosmin284: WHOA
[9:28:27] Arthident: nope
[9:28:32] Arthident: wasnt there before i'd say
[9:28:36] andyjamesgames: never knew it was there YEP
[9:28:39] Todd686: well we can tell Ren hasnt been there before CatDriving
[9:28:47] Arthident: @Todd686 keking
[9:28:52] SikEo_88: for me being able to have a DPS spec on my priest of questing would make life easier in the next phases of the game
[9:28:53] cosmin284: NODDERS
[9:28:53] Renfuryy: I havent xff
[9:29:02] Todd686: Desi losing it Unhinged
[9:29:03] SikEo_88: and when i hit level cap having holy and disc specs would be so good
[9:29:04] Creampuff1112: i find new stuff that i have never seen before like everyday
[9:29:06] andyjamesgames: Frostmourne hungers

[9:31:34] Todd686: woah
[9:31:36] SikEo_88: disc leveling is definitely better in this version of the game than it was in classic and TBC, but its still slower than shadow lol
[9:31:41] cosmin284: woah
[9:31:47] Arthident: WHOA
[9:31:58] SikEo_88: i wanna have both holy and disc specs available though
