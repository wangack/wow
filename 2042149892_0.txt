[1:19:00] Ninjian: punished for trying to behave Sadge
[1:19:22] Guffels: yeah if your only lust is a mage, its probably worth tracking their lust cd and lining it up with them
[1:20:01] wow_its_tenbux: just backpedal
[1:20:04] wow_its_tenbux: 100% of the way
[1:20:09] wow_its_tenbux: you will take no damage

[1:24:54] heygadzie: how rise feels now @jdotb
[1:26:32] OGpersi_: its interrupts
[1:26:50] yarpx: I think a cast got off
[1:27:00] heygadzie: this is the worst trackpack
[1:27:04] heygadzie: trash pack ever
[1:27:13] heygadzie: like legit

[1:28:24] kaspagre: These mobs cast
[1:28:29] kaspagre: Probably cast
[1:28:39] Nico_vdM: Do you have advanced death log?
[1:28:40] yarpx: it was a cast
[1:28:46] JimmyBeardSlam: at what point do we bring back ccing mobs in packs and kill them after
[1:29:11] NuminexVG: !drops
[1:29:14] Dermortis1990: @JimmyBeardSlam never. timewaste
[1:29:47] JimmyBeardSlam: so is not being able to kill and deplete key, so at some point it may be worth
[1:30:05] Muddymonk: Do the small dudes deal damage with their AoE even if you dont touch the animated part?
[1:30:18] Nico_vdM: afaik none of those can be cc-ed
[1:30:56] JimmyBeardSlam: im not saying thats what they should have done btw, im jsut saying i miss the old days of actually cc'ing mobs
[1:30:58] yarpx: perfect storm
[1:31:54] deb5769: good morning
[1:32:51] kevinsk8er: cant the tank desync them by taunting one first and waiting a sec?
[1:33:37] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:34:21] Muddymonk: @kevinsk8er They are all linked so they enter combat damn near instantly. You can interrupt their shield cast super late to maybe delay cast a bit tho
[1:34:57] Muddymonk: Feel like that's so minor there tho, all about cd management
[1:35:09] koala_715: how was the vault of disappointment?
[1:35:16] Nico_vdM: !vault
[1:35:27] Nico_vdM: bot seems to be asleep atm
[1:35:29] FrostmagicED: duality of man
[1:35:34] FrostmagicED: I got 2 myth track branches
[1:35:38] Muddymonk: Have you healed last boss Rise as a MW monk on a high key?
[1:35:43] FrostmagicED: one on my rdruid one on my disco priest
[1:35:44] koala_715: nice, got my mythic track tier gloves on my druid and bis cloak on hunter.
[1:36:07] Muddymonk: Okay, ty for answer
[1:36:52] Hambrick: what's your opinion on resto druid in high keys (13s and higher)?
[1:36:54] Muddymonk: No it'd be higher, still the issue could be the same, was about to ask how you deal with the transition between p1 -> p2, with no target to fistweave off of
[1:36:58] koala_715: Rise got nerfed too
[1:37:02] tunnelfauna: it's too late in the season
[1:37:07] tunnelfauna: stopped playing already
[1:37:11] wow_its_tenbux: jUsT rUn YoUr oWn KeY
[1:37:11] Pinslate: even at 24-26 was barren yesterday

[1:41:00] Muddymonk: Maybe you already have a team
[1:41:10] Muddymonk: full 5 man premade that is
[1:41:48] itsmecjayy: have u ever thought about getting a grp of average andys and turning them into high rio chads from ur stream xD :)
[1:42:07] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:42:20] anaya909: that's a worse idea than playing d4
[1:42:36] Muddymonk: haha
[1:42:48] somethineuw: KEKW
[1:42:56] itsmecjayy: would be cool content
[1:43:21] wow_its_tenbux: would work if you had a built-up youtube audience and you leaned into the "high school football coach" angle
[1:43:23] Muddymonk: They both need to have that as a goal and the right attitude
[1:43:30] zzugelder: a good chunk of viewers are probably healers haha
[1:43:59] Sorr08: Did you solidify your MDI team?
[1:43:59] KommanderKoa: KommanderKoa subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 7 months!

[1:45:15] Muddymonk: If you were to join/make a team, what would be your goal for M+?
[1:45:20] mattyp13: Sounds like a risky investment
[1:45:56] tr1plus: part of the becoming good is a dedicated team, shot caller, role assignment, ...
[1:47:39] somethineuw: EU 25-26 range is absolute ass today idk why people forget dungeons on reset
[1:47:44] FLUFFALOBUFFALO: sorry team didnt work out
[1:48:11] Fortearmure: hello jb
[1:48:40] Muddymonk: Mordrim is BRM only right?

[1:48:53] tr1plus: maybe an aug for BL & buffs
[1:49:12] khaotiklaw: what addon shows the class in the groups ?
[1:49:24] zebracak35: !wt

[2:20:44] tr1plus: everyone will also need 2.5 ethernet adapters in their pc
[2:21:05] tr1plus: and older devices (laptops, the switch ,...) won't use 2.5 either
[2:21:19] Metsyse: did you change your computer's ethernet adapter settings from auto negotiate to gigabyte speed?
[2:21:45] Metsyse: aw man, caught an add as soon as i sent that.
[2:21:52] Anzolix92: do you have anything that would need more than 1gig tho
[2:21:54] tr1plus: get the cheap amazon ones
[2:21:57] lazylad02: Kek
[2:22:03] xHILDAx: As a network engineer: only 200$? :p\
[2:22:03] tr1plus: they are like 70-70 for an 8 port
[2:22:07] tr1plus: they run my whole homelab
[2:22:22] tr1plus: 70-80€ I mean
[2:22:44] Metsyse: i think that the edge router has the most usability for a home lab.
[2:22:49] Metsyse: back from my add :)
[2:23:10] Metsyse: absolutely a must!
[2:23:20] tr1plus: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0C8H7DF6T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details  92€ for an 8 port 2.5g switch with a 10G SFTP backbone
[2:23:31] tr1plus: I use this one, but their are cheaper alternatives
[2:23:33] Metsyse: otherwise you'll get lower speeds when there isnt a high demand.
[2:24:11] Metsyse: Right-click on the network adapter that is connected to your router and select “Properties”. In the Properties window, select the “Configure” tab. Here you will find a list of all the settings for your network adapter. Look for the setting labeled “Speed & Duplex” and select “1 Gbps Full Duplex”.
[2:24:12] tr1plus: yeah sorry, the brand is something
[2:24:26] RemwayTV: monka
[2:24:26] tr1plus: but it works
[2:24:32] tr1plus: I'm sorry

[2:24:38] FLUFFALOBUFFALO: xD
[2:24:44] jdsauza: seems innocuous
[2:24:48] ottomr1990: that is an unfortunate grouping of consonants
[2:24:58] tr1plus: they sell the same switch under 10 different brands
[2:25:29] ren0m: How fast is your internet now?
[2:25:40] Metsyse: 2.5, yeah'
[2:25:44] mashanu: jdot about to go offline
[2:25:45] ren0m: I have it set on 2

[2:28:55] Metsyse: personally, i use www.ipcow.com for speed tests. i like that it gives your public ip as well.
[2:29:10] Metsyse: rather than going to whatismyip.com
[2:29:16] ephemerisone74: how do you feel about the rise nerfs?
[2:30:19] ren0m: Doesn't seem to

[2:34:28] tr1plus: why would you have multiple routers?
[2:34:37] tr1plus: or you put them in bridge mode for AP?

[2:37:32] zebracak35: You can breed in pokemon?
[2:37:47] CyonDru: you can also catch humans and butcher them
[2:37:50] ren0m: lol
[2:37:52] ifuse: HUH
[2:38:16] extracuter1: you got caught
[2:38:20] Piki9: It's the same "breeding" as in regular pokemon games
[2:38:29] Guffels: I would be more concerned about the violent butchering of pals than the imaginary sex they have when making an egg
[2:38:36] zzugelder: lack of lfg got you in trouble
[2:38:45] Piki9: At least the butchering is pixilated :,)

[2:39:51] ren0m: eyelash?
[2:40:15] tr1plus: the prevoker streamer
[2:40:22] tr1plus: she switched to pala doing a zero to hero
[2:40:23] ren0m: Ah
[2:40:26] ren0m: Not familiar with him
[2:40:32] tr1plus: it's a her but yeah :p
[2:40:41] ren0m: Makes sense :P
[2:42:14] Guffels: i would switch off pres voker too tbh. atleast druid has a chance at being meta
[2:44:12] meowphietm: Jdotbear
[2:44:35] FrostmagicED: jdot I feel like I can get to 3200 on my mistweaver from 2500 and not knowing how to play it (rat alt) faster than I can get my 3200 priest to 3400.
[2:44:39] FrostmagicED: tell me im stupid
[2:44:51] slimshadys_shade: Hey @jdotb, do you ever use Rejuv in keys? (Sorry for the question, I just started playing WoW again)
[2:45:04] theBroHam: @slimshadys_shade Not really
[2:45:05] tr1plus: 20s are crazy easy. The difference in 15-20 is the same as 21-23
[2:45:43] CyonDru: @slimshadys_shade it’s the lowest prio. mostly used as a mastery stack
[2:46:05] simplyhebi: rejuv still feels like shit to press and im not sure if that will ever change
[2:46:05] slimshadys_shade: thanks @theBroHam @CyonDru !
[2:46:29] StrangertEU: StrangertEU subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! :)
[2:47:34] zzugelder: they need to buff rejuv in 5man content like they did with tranq
[2:48:13] StrangertEU: That would really mess up pvp, but I guess I agree for pve
[2:48:18] Guffels: i feel like they really nailed the balance mastery so resto probably deserves another pass
[2:48:21] simplyhebi: thatd be nuts
[2:49:22] simplyhebi: deep focus lite
[2:50:23] StrangertEU: That just sounds like flourish for rejuv
[2:50:42] ithline_sk: they could have merged their treant ideas into swiftmend, but they probably won't step away from pet healing now
[2:50:48] simplyhebi: its interesting we have all these active nodes in our tree like invig or overgrowth that have just collected dust for years
[2:51:15] slimshadys_shade: What are your thoughts on verdancy vs. Flourish? I feel like I constantly use it wrong, so I thought of changing it
[2:51:40] StrangertEU: Would be cool to then do flourish into invigo
[2:51:51] maenkins: jumping in on convo, would you do invigorate > swiftmend (verdant infusion)?
[2:52:00] slimshadys_shade: verdant infusion sorry @jdotb

[2:54:39] rangedonly_tv: Why r you playing on eu?
[2:54:45] CyonDru: dude didn’t even have the leggo. would’ve been even more nuts
[2:54:45] theBroHam: !eu
[2:54:47] CyonDru: !eu
[2:54:50] kelly_mac06: @theBroHam so the buffs feel good?
[2:54:56] CyonDru: think not is still deadge
[2:55:10] CyonDru: @rangedonly_tv tldr, to play during the day and have more time w family in the evening
[2:55:19] Minigamer911: Hit them with the, "let me axe you a question"
[2:55:22] theBroHam: yeah they're real nice. I just got lego and the damage increase between buffs and lego is like 15-20%
[2:55:25] Tharayel: Robin has loads of fun in RET now
[2:55:31] CyonDru: @kelly_mac06 jdotbComfy
[2:55:32] Minigamer911: It tilts the axelets oddoneVillain
[2:55:46] rangedonly_tv: @CyonDru thanks! Played some keys with @jdotb and was so confused why I heard an american accent in eu haha

[2:56:31] DisgracedDuke: no fun allowed
[2:56:34] theBroHam: Mythic + talent reminders @CyonDru
[2:56:52] kalegeneral: Naowh always got 1 last dungeon, doubt youll need it
[2:56:52] basudks: naowh pressed turn evil like 3 times entire last key
[2:56:58] slimshadys_shade: What about getting rid of Thrash?
[2:56:58] CyonDru: @thebroham thanks homie
[2:56:58] kalegeneral: lmao shhhh

[3:02:42] O_Henriques: we did 29 atal
[3:02:54] Riberson1: for fun
[3:02:55] trin_jp: starfire just feeling good
[3:03:02] tr1plus: cuz it's fun
[3:03:06] tr1plus: that's why you do this
[3:03:14] koala_715: Maybe this is a weird take, but I'd like to see them get rid of tyrannical and fort. They're just boring af.
[3:03:25] trin_jp: kittyweaving 10 buttons for 10% more dmg v.s. 1 button spam
[3:03:33] zzugelder: incorp desperately needs a longer cast
[3:03:54] DisgracedDuke: incorp desperately needs to be removed from the game
[3:04:27] O_Henriques: yeah i mean afflicted is insta dispell while incorp u need to cast to cancel it most of the classes at least
[3:04:59] O_Henriques: but afflicted casts once and it's just haste that u lose,  incorp keeps casting and just makes u die lmao
[3:05:14] tr1plus: "just haste"
[3:05:27] tr1plus: try casting a spell with 200% haste reduction xD
[3:06:22] O_Henriques: having played both affixes a ton, incorp goes off way more than afflicted + incorp casts usually kill u
[3:06:40] tr1plus: yeah I'm not saying the affix is better or worse
[3:06:46] WingedChipmunk: WingedChipmunk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 11 month streak! WOOOO
[3:07:13] tr1plus: I'm mostly saying that 200% haste reduction is also certain death depending on the pull
[3:08:01] Minigamer911: It turns the game in to ff14 Kappa
[3:08:12] Spritesgud: oh hey that's naowh
[3:08:30] WingedChipmunk: afflicted and incorp gotta go
[3:08:34] dragona92: !vault
[3:08:53] WingedChipmunk: yes
[3:08:57] O_Henriques: @WingedChipmunk i'd rather they balance it instead of removing them and adding other bullshit
[3:08:59] WingedChipmunk: dogs do drop sanguine
[3:09:11] DONGAMAN: @jdotb how do you live with yourself while being so sexy?
[3:09:42] Xajmon: When to use treeants, on CD? cant see treeants on the hotbar
[3:10:04] WingedChipmunk: @O_Henriques i mean im on board with removing it all. Negative gameplay does not feel enjoyable. I think M+ is at a point where they should take a step back and really analyze what playstyle could be fun
[3:11:04] WingedChipmunk: @Xajmon he tries to not sit on Max CD
[3:11:09] WingedChipmunk: max stacks
[3:11:28] Xajmon: @WingedChipmunk Thanks, will be using them on cd then :D
[3:11:53] Sokchoy: happy push week
[3:12:05] danaxvx: what's fun about m+? blasting huge packs and going super fast, they need to add affixes that let us blast bigger packs and go even faster
[3:12:22] justdiscforfun: hi
[3:12:40] RisuOksa: Seasonal affixes had some positives to them. I think just having one of those would make them more fun
[3:13:26] WingedChipmunk: @danaxvx positive affixes have been the most well received. the bad affixes, such as explosive/necrotic/teaming/inspiring have been AWFUL gameplay experience
[3:13:31] RisuOksa: like SL season one you wanted the buff for hard boss or big pack
[3:14:00] WingedChipmunk: ya seasonal affixes have been the most well received because there was a positive to them
[3:14:03] slimshadys_shade: SL season 2 affix was also really really nice
[3:14:08] WingedChipmunk: and they REALLY changed up the gameplay of the dungeon
[3:14:10] Jemba: Deadge

[3:14:42] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: too much girth
[3:14:45] SalmiraMH: How many stacks did the boss have there?

[3:24:31] cloudberrylive: rofl naowh yelling for a heal on trash
[3:24:39] w1zzlet: @jdotb hey man i want to start healing in mythic plus but cant decide which would be the easiest class to learn how to heal with do you have any suggestions thank you in advance.
[3:26:50] MitcheyRoo: Aug = easiest
[3:26:56] kingcotsios93: Pala to strong after buff:)?
[3:31:38] shoneshaman: @w1zzlet I would suggest a reactionary healer such as Rsham. However Im biased as I started as rsham and I consider it the 'easiest' healer. Technically speaking I think holy priest is the simplest yet it has a lot of buttons
[3:33:22] w1zzlet: @shoneshaman that's awesome advice thank you i've never played healer in any sort of end content at all, soo any advice is welcome, i feel kind that my decisions come mainly off the meta, but i just wanted to start healing as im getting bored of playing dps
[3:35:14] tr1plus: or pick a class you have as DPS that has a heal speck
[3:35:15] Guffels: what is your dps main right now?
[3:35:17] shoneshaman: @w1zzlet if you're used to playing melee dps, mistweaver is probably a good bet as well, they're meta rn and strong.
[3:35:34] tr1plus: it saves you having to learn interrupts & other utility abilities
[3:36:11] w1zzlet: @shoneshaman i was looking at that but my main is currently a demo warlock, i find i have better luck when im further away from the fight lol
[3:36:23] zzugelder: resto druid is one of the harder healing specs to learn fresh, at least while trying to catweave
[3:36:38] tr1plus: if you are learning to heal I wouldn't bother doing dps
[3:36:40] Archmage_Michael: heal Naowh
[3:36:53] tr1plus: first learn to keep people alive & dispells & interrupts before going to a DPS rotation
[3:37:26] tr1plus: I haven't played resto druid too much, but as a pure healer spec I think it's easy to learn, hard to master
[3:37:31] Guffels: oh you already have 0 movement lol. holy priest or resto shaman for sure. pres evoker would be the wild card caster healer that gets underrated but has a cult fan base
[3:37:54] TBouse: you need like double the keybinds to play rdruid
[3:37:59] shoneshaman: @Guffels pres evoker is definitely not a good starter healer tbh
[3:39:07] Nonyamuff: I've been a Hpriest since vanilla...it may be easy but I enjoy it
[3:39:45] Guffels: the people who are good at h priest really showed this tier. im still getting parsed on by our raids h priest. man doesnt care that disc is good, hes just better
[3:40:05] kalegeneral: You're fucking destroying this boss
[3:44:02] sheenayy: is resto druid alot easier than it was in SL?
[3:44:44] Tfos: personally for me resto is hardest healer atm

[3:47:30] Kingcoconutcrab: @Guffels glad to be in parties where the healer always minmaxes the fck out of their dps :p
[3:48:02] adachi_akaso: do you feel the mana buff
[3:48:12] Guffels: as someone who would rather hold down the wrath key then ever have a dead gcd, yeah sorry bout that lol
[3:48:24] zzugelder: he never went sub 90% mana before the nerf
[3:48:43] CyonDru: @adachi_akaso keys arent really a good measure for the buff cause we hardly use mana in keys anyway

[4:14:01] lostamongliars: big fooking wings blocking the ground
[4:18:10] kaosnblood: Does he plays with dps trinket ? Like rageheart or the tindral one ?
[4:19:13] dragona92: @kaosnblood U can see the trinket icons on the right of your screen where the stats are
[4:20:12] kaosnblood: Ty didnt see that on my little screen cellphone sorry

[4:22:55] Shadostealer: @jdotb do you prefer if the dps gun down one of the guys or just do the better for timer thing of focus the dragon?
[4:24:28] DrMeat: that play was biblical

[4:29:06] itz_epiiic: ?
[4:29:14] toastbam: how does the rise nerf feel?
[4:29:49] dilweed88: @itz_epiiic cenarion ward if i had to guess
[4:29:58] Darkelment: probably mass barrier
[4:30:13] itz_epiiic: Nah, was on 2 diff people and ward didnt go on CD @dilweed88
[4:30:24] itz_epiiic: Ooo didnt even think of mass barrier
[4:30:33] maneatingpotato1: @Darkelment ^^^^mage stuff
[4:30:39] Darkelment: unless you're talking about his shield which is tank trinket
[4:30:43] theBroHam: rip
[4:31:15] Guffels: 252k overall kinda sus
[4:32:31] lazylad02: hello Jb FamilyMan
[4:33:08] EriktheRed27: Doesn't verdancy always heal you regardless of whether or not you're in efflo?
[4:34:56] caradea_: it looks the same for me
[4:35:00] caradea_: never checked it before
[4:35:40] Darkelment: tank dies usually their fault
[4:36:05] Tfos: yup that looked like tank death
[4:36:06] theBroHam: unless you have lay on hands or bubble there's not much you can do that fast
[4:36:14] Zapzoda: he didn’t use CDS
[4:36:38] pl0de: What weakaura or plater script do you use for incorporeal?
[4:36:44] kelly_mac06: no wogs?? nothing?
[4:37:00] SinstoneRelics: 3 globals should include a heal or shield for a pally, it’s their whole rotation
[4:37:00] Kurupac: Wasn't ur fault, he just got blasted. He had defs
[4:37:02] jdotb: https://wago.io/IncorporealAffix/14
[4:37:08] pl0de: Ty!
[4:37:31] theBroHam: i agree. If someone had defensives the death is their fault
[4:38:21] ren0m: Did you time it?
[4:38:24] Sebell777: Fast as fuck church man
[4:38:51] DONGAMAN: why is your priest a fat woman
[4:39:14] ren0m: It's called busty
[4:39:35] Guffels: some people dont know whats good in the world
[4:39:37] theBroHam: shes thiccc
[4:39:44] Bellissimo__: its from using shakeweights
[4:39:44] zzugelder: Called beautiful
[4:39:52] akizanee: @jdotb i know its kinda impossible to knowbut what do you think about the next healer meta for DF dugneons with the current chosen tier sets ?
[4:39:57] Guffels: shes not kultiran female fat and thats all that matters
[4:40:01] akizanee: wanna start gearing my healers
[4:40:15] Guffels: @akizanee do we even know its df dungeons tho?
[4:40:27] theBroHam: it is df dungeons
[4:41:25] Guffels: you right.
[4:42:22] Guffels: i have been running it in heroic. its pretty good.
[4:42:46] Guffels: hope you liked smolderon tho because it feels the same but with 1 min instead of 30 seconds
[4:42:47] glitchhking: Hey jdot, whats your thoughts on the blossom trink from the last boss?
[4:43:24] PNZTK: hey jb, i was just wonder do you feel good when you pull and when you push?
[4:43:43] Guffels: yes
[4:43:51] bornbetter: not hard
[4:44:00] bornbetter: you go from about a 4min cd to a 2min cd
[4:44:03] Guffels: medium. depends how many smites you cast to reduce penence cd
[4:44:07] ren0m: each bolt or each cast?
[4:44:22] bornbetter: its 4
[4:44:24] bornbetter: bolts per cast
[4:44:28] bornbetter: w constigation
[4:44:32] Guffels: and remember radiance adds bolts
[4:45:17] bornbetter: @jdotb you go from a 4min cd to a 2min cd if you use penance on cooldown
[4:46:38] RivathaGaming: healing dummy?
[4:46:49] bornbetter: yea
[4:47:04] Guffels: its not tighter than smolderon
[4:49:58] RivathaGaming: can you transfer your NA account to EU? or do you have to make a new one from zero?
[4:50:03] Guffels: from 0
[4:51:51] Dayoka: @RivathaGaming no transfer you need to start over, you wont have access to anything from your na account if you go eu for example not mounts not anything lol its really dumb
[4:52:05] melkboer_: Hey good sir, for MW, are Secret Infusion and Focused Thunder interchangeable? I see MW use both in m+
[4:53:31] melkboer_: It's more like personal flavour a bit? Im just starting out so the extra free enveloping or back to back RSK feel pretty nice
[4:53:33] moitchster: what u up to ? why r u jumping all over valdraken :D
[4:53:48] moitchster: gl :)
[4:54:25] maenkins: are y'all past intermission 1? that's a doozie
[4:54:32] Vitaraptor: Was it yur choice or guilds to play disc in raid?
[4:55:30] Vitaraptor: I stuck witg druid and ngl, ive struggled all tier
[4:56:31] pl0de: Apparently Verdancy always prios the druid as part of the "up to 3 targets" the tooltip mentions. Might have to fact check that but that's what I just read in a comment.
[4:56:32] asurrraaa: healing became so easy once I obtained my 4pc.
[4:56:48] Guffels: i loved making the jump to disc. the min max note writing is my favorite part
[4:57:17] Guffels: were people just not standing in your efflo?
[4:57:58] proetix: Is it possible that people were in the efflo for the first lifebloom verdancy but then moved out for the later blooms and then all verdancy went to you?
[4:58:04] Guffels: if you had logs you could probably prove its bugged if thats where we are now
[4:58:16] MieLULe: @jdotb yumytv made good explanation on mastering disco preist today, imagine gausian distribution, left lower end is low iq player "smite goes brrrr", middle - medium iq player " must track attonments, cds, etc", right lower end - the 200iq player "smite goes brrrrr"
[4:58:27] Skyfall715: mastery? how many hots on yourself?
[4:58:38] Skyfall715: or was it more ticks not more healing
[4:58:39] Guffels: @MieLULe this is so true on the last 3 fights this tier
[4:58:56] DisgracedDuke: every log got this verdancy situation, its not an anomaly
[4:59:22] healapotamus: I try to shoot for 17
[4:59:48] Guffels: i entirely fixed that problem with the jedi swoosh wa we built. just making sure to stop smiting once i hit 30 seconds cdr
[5:00:17] healapotamus: 17 keeps me parsing blue :)
[5:00:18] Vitaraptor: A tracker/timer to kno how many u have active at any time
[5:00:50] Guffels: i rebuilt the wa for shadowfiend with 120 seconds as the trigger so it works for 1 minute fyrarkk'
[5:02:28] MieLULe: @MieLULe he showed clip from raid where he did like that 10 mil healing in duration of DR
[5:06:25] DisgracedDuke: avg verdancy tick on druid is in normal range, but the amount of ticks is somehow pushing three-digit numbers
[5:08:17] Guffels: yeah lemme launch
[5:09:34] whiskeyhide: weird
[5:09:39] whiskeyhide: KEKW
[5:09:59] casualshame: Can I join?
[5:11:11] ub__: my brother in christ you need reps on disc
[5:12:19] proetix: I'm kind of curious do you make disc timers yourself or do you get them from somewhere?
[5:13:02] proetix: Thank you
[5:13:54] Sokchoy: wait this is a reclear
[5:14:59] Guffels: https://wago.io/j2a2oJj8C The field you change is in condition 3. if you wanted a 60 second sf, you use 120 as the trigger. if you wanted 50 second, you would need to put 130
[5:15:30] Guffels: yes
[5:15:45] Grasshoppa117: yo JB how hard is Heroic fyrak compared to heroic sark for puggers life baby
[5:16:07] Guffels: just sf
[5:16:47] Guffels: its almost identical tho, i could probably make it work for both if having 2 wasnt so much easier
[5:17:11] Grasshoppa117: ty
[5:17:27] jack__burton: and for ppl to not tunnel with tornados
[5:18:40] Grasshoppa117: got the game on autopilot haha
[5:20:26] Grasshoppa117: ash or gas baby
[5:20:45] Guffels: blank the display text field
[5:25:08] zhets41: !drops
[5:26:34] AnseDK: Salve JB! Greetings from Brazil

[5:30:54] EggsDaddyLongLegs: A lot to learn in this game sheeesh
[5:37:16] Sokchoy: do you need a merc healer
[5:42:29] Mafre1: Uppies lets go
[5:44:51] Falahaaaaa: hows the weekly affixes u think?
[5:45:01] Mafre1: Good rule of thumb as disc is that as soon as they start discussing positions/movement on voice, you're allowed to mute
[5:45:56] Guffels: lol
[5:46:09] Sokchoy: yes into boss
[5:46:18] Guffels: i took it in keys for the longest time just for fun
[5:46:33] Guffels: now im meta slaving te
[5:46:46] Sokchoy: normal ramp but instead of evang or pet you press uppies
[5:47:15] Mafre1: Also mindblast before
[5:47:23] Sokchoy: ok try hard
[5:47:30] Guffels: you only have to double radiance right since uppies applies 10 attonements?
[5:47:36] Taslack: RANGED PLAYER CLASSIC
[5:47:45] DONGAMAN: OMEGALUL
[5:47:48] Sokchoy: you do not play the 10 atonement thing it costs 3 extra points
[5:47:57] Guffels: kek i think he is lol
[5:48:03] Sokchoy: god fucking dammit
[5:48:26] Mafre1: World first full uppies Fyrakk kill
[5:48:35] Sokchoy: theres no way man
[5:48:55] Guffels: thats what they take on lorrgs KEKW
[5:49:08] Mafre1: No way man
[5:49:10] Guffels: they uppies every 2
[5:49:21] Guffels: 2:30*
[5:49:41] DONGAMAN: no monk for revival?
[5:49:55] Guffels: called out today. also not required anymore but still very good
[5:50:27] ArchRaid: anyone else having spirits die super fast in phase 2 of fyrakk on heroic?
[5:50:54] Guffels: the healer ones?? didnt know they can die to damage. sounds like bad healers
[5:51:13] ArchRaid: they would spawn in and die within 5 seconds with no damage adds around
[5:51:28] VokkeNs: they tick down as soon as they spawn
[5:51:34] VokkeNs: so a healer needs to be around them asap
[5:51:49] VokkeNs: otherwise they die within that time window
[5:51:56] ArchRaid: wonder if that's a change... was fine last week
[5:52:15] somerandomwowguy: Never heard of that problem before
[5:52:30] ArchRaid: me either till it happened repeatedly last night
[5:52:33] Guffels: just check some logs and compare damage taken for the same ad set on the ads
[5:53:25] JukeboxHey: How is Fyrakki prison, is it worse than Tindral
[5:54:29] Guffels: they are only 50 pulls in and tindral was 450. they have a ways to go till its jail levels
[5:56:41] Guffels: i think theres value to making sure people understand how to press the macro but if you dont get it after smolderon idk if this tier is for you lol
[5:56:41] skeeld: i agree with mr jdotb
[5:56:48] IKurrent: JDotBased Pog
[5:58:46] IKurrent: yes
[5:58:48] IKurrent: omg
[5:59:15] skeeld: its also just like, why
[5:59:17] IKurrent: our evoker is sometimes like 2 seconds late and im like my man please
[5:59:21] skeeld: what are you doing that you need to delay spatial
[5:59:23] skeeld: you're an auggie
[6:00:49] IKurrent: @skeeld facts EZ
[6:01:28] Gambit2012: dont yell
[6:02:02] Javorens: I recently started prog after the seed man nerfs and it is very frustrating doing this boss
[6:02:25] IKurrent: Banger dinkDonk
[6:05:31] Mafre1: Are you getting a rescue for the 2nd dream rend?
[6:06:14] Mafre1: If you do then you can stay back after they move the boss without worrying about moving far up
[6:09:03] IKurrent: my man created chaos BASED
[6:13:39] Protracks: so true
[6:20:07] skeeld: i mean do they even realize theyre late
[6:20:14] skeeld: they could be just winging it for all we know
[6:20:35] melkboer_: is there a specific reason you keep your buffs on party frames in squares instead of textured icons? Or just cba?
[6:20:52] Javorens: I'd recommend gating to where you do mythic soaks btw
[6:21:05] skeeld: i had to push my healers to give me exact timers for spatial just to be consistent
[6:21:14] Javorens: It's what my guild does for first soaks, and it's always up for fintermission
[6:22:52] Darkelment: yes
[6:23:07] bingo_roswell: there is an add on that will say “watch your step”
[6:23:37] MicHawkh: UH ok....gm spanking inc.
[6:24:31] ren0m: What %?
[6:25:25] zanis_: zanis_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[6:26:58] siaulerandom: Hahah
[6:27:30] Guffels: i am terrible at using spacial. all my key bindings are built so the buttons i use to move and the casted spells overlap fingers
[6:29:49] DoctorOgenki: mouse button bund?
[6:29:58] DoctorOgenki: bind*
[6:30:43] Guffels: idk if my wrist can handle casting every smite with my mouse thumb
[6:35:35] cultbaus: it's inspiring to watch you endure such adversity man
[6:35:39] sgtshellshocka: guys need more healing at 1:45
[6:35:45] Mafre1: Might be time to swap uppies to first dream rend so we can see the spell in action
[6:35:45] sgtshellshocka: yall getting turbo ass fucked there
[6:36:00] cultbaus: real mafre?
[6:36:00] zanis_: That sounds.... painful
[6:36:05] cultbaus: from tibia?
[6:36:06] Sokchoy: think we need some uppies casts
[6:36:12] Mafre1: Thats me
[6:36:14] Mafre1: Tibia main
[6:36:19] cultbaus: yes man send it
[6:36:24] Sokchoy: send it pussy
[6:36:28] Sokchoy: its a 2min cd
[6:36:30] Mafre1: Its time to test
[6:36:32] sgtshellshocka: DO IT
[6:37:09] Mafre1: I was here
[6:37:28] Mafre1: No uppies hmm...
[6:37:29] cultbaus: coward
[6:38:30] Mafre1: Passive spatial FeelsBadMan
[6:39:03] Guffels: i dont understand the dispel mech. why isnt this dispel on cd like heroic?
[6:39:14] sgtshellshocka: barrierd after the aoe hit omegalul
[6:39:25] Mafre1: holy shit
[6:39:26] Sokchoy: holy fuck i was here
[6:39:30] cultbaus: proggies
[6:39:36] Sokchoy: any clippers
[6:39:54] Mafre1: LMAO
[6:39:56] Qruzaa: HAHA
[6:39:57] cultbaus: epic
[6:40:08] Basic_3: lol, he placed a new gateway
[6:40:09] Guffels: lol they replaced it
[6:40:11] Millenzz: Jebaited
[6:40:11] Basic_3: and erased the old one
[6:40:14] Mafre1: Jebaited
[6:40:15] cultbaus: yes
[6:40:24] Darkelment: Jebaited
[6:41:26] Clayoo_: Random question - Can you meld cinderbolt storm in EB?
[6:41:28] Mafre1: Uppies on pull this time
[6:43:12] Guffels: it would be close. typical is 2:30 min so you might be able to pull off 2 min
[6:43:43] Mafre1: It has begun
[6:43:48] Mafre1: The intermission discussions
[6:43:55] Vegolix: R stands for right not red
[6:45:56] malkyratv: what is music ?
[6:47:02] kondelol: wokege
[6:48:57] Protracks: You do more HPS when you eat frontals
[6:49:07] Protracks: Secret tech
[6:49:49] sgtshellshocka: thats my motto, I have a million vers/ 16% avoidance, no shot i move outta that frontal
[6:52:55] Nebulizer87: this fight made me immediately miss tindral prog
[6:53:29] Sokchoy: this fight makes jb's tindral prep look grounded
[6:53:42] sgtshellshocka: I think the dev who made this boss, halondrus, etc, doesnt know the intersection between fun and hard
[6:53:53] sgtshellshocka: just made it fucking hard, not fun
[6:54:07] sgtshellshocka: as a healer
[6:54:23] cucumbertoessniffa: i feel like the intersection between fun and hard is sex. fights should be designed to be like sex.
[6:54:35] Sokchoy: i remember jb tweet when he said "lmao disc priest just copy timers" and look where we are now
[6:54:47] DoctorOgenki: ya, like Lei Shen Kreygasm
[6:55:08] Sokchoy: motto of my morning toilet routines
[6:55:09] RoodToob: now it
[6:55:24] Protracks: @Sokchoy mind degraded from years of 25 cpm rejuv
[6:55:25] RoodToob: now it's "disc copies timers and has to smite 16 times a minute to make it work"
[6:55:53] Sokchoy: oh no the spec might be somewhat of a challenge to do well on like everyone told me
[6:56:27] Protracks: nah man you just have to give up all of resto druids tankiness mobility and healing and its the same
[6:57:00] Sokchoy: is he even playing double PS
[6:57:06] Sokchoy: probably not right cause TW dont do that
[6:57:19] Jaylight__: PS is an hps loss
[6:58:12] Sokchoy: if you squint really closely DA is like chrysalis (broken druid talent number 23 from last expac)
[6:58:33] Sokchoy: show sanctuary hps
[6:58:36] Sokchoy: im sure its worth
[6:59:48] Protracks: lol
[7:00:42] Nebulizer87: I wouldn’t argue this is hard they just over layer mechanics on top of mechanics
[7:00:59] Nebulizer87: and the dispel mechanic is lazy
[7:01:16] Taslack: "i wouldn't argue this is hard" then lists the exact reason it's hard
[7:01:17] Taslack: ???
[7:01:25] whiskeyhide: KEKW 󠀀
[7:01:32] Taslack: like yeah it's hard because you have to deal with a lot of shit at the same time gz
[7:01:38] Taslack: that's just called being hard
[7:01:44] Nebulizer87: nope
[7:01:50] Jaylight__: based
[7:01:52] Nebulizer87: it’s bloated not hard
[7:02:01] sgtshellshocka: you think this gets nerfed before next reset or after?
[7:02:13] Nebulizer87: they waiting till HoF is filled
[7:02:20] sgtshellshocka: HOF is filling rly slow
[7:02:45] Nebulizer87: it won’t be long now with the tindral nerf
[7:02:54] Nebulizer87: over 800 guilds now on Fry prog
[7:03:09] sgtshellshocka: surely they nerf it before 200 kills with all the non - MW comps
[7:03:12] sgtshellshocka: that are progging
[7:03:14] Sokchoy: hot take a lot of mechanics overlapping is hard
[7:03:20] Taslack: @Nebulizer87 does ur minder make you wear your helmet when you sit at the computer or only when you go out of the house?
[7:03:47] Nebulizer87: good luck with your green parses Taslack
[7:03:56] Mafre1: grrrr
[7:04:05] JayPuppa: why is a frontal facing that way? lol

[7:11:35] Inksanityy: @rogoozin dont try to login to the character that youre moving
[7:11:58] rogoozin: @Inksanityy Is there a way to keep the game open or closed? ?
[7:12:06] doom_llama: !ui
[7:12:26] Inksanityy: @rogoozin what do you mean? Doesn't matter if you close the game and you can play other characters
[7:13:00] Amandalorian: hi jb — how's the fyrakk prog going

[7:32:53] Insivius: love the vibes dude, watching you prog is so chill
[7:35:48] somerandomwowguy: isnt liquidStart3 for hardcoding positions during intermission? So you always will get left 4?
[7:36:06] somerandomwowguy: Should be
[7:37:11] Protracks: we love private auras and we love forced macros to circumvent private auras
[7:37:27] somerandomwowguy: You doesnt have to count when you are position 4, pos 5 is always in the middle, so you just check the color next to middle and see if its your color
[7:37:37] somerandomwowguy: dont*
[7:38:36] Sokchoy: just stand in the middle who cares
[7:38:40] somerandomwowguy: 1, 2 and 3 pretty much have to turn around and count theirs
[7:41:06] somerandomwowguy: Everyone should get a /raid in their macro, if that doesnt say anything they pressed the wrong button
[7:41:38] somerandomwowguy: Liquid have their backend wa LiquidWeakauras that everyone needs to have and everyone needs to have the Amirdrassil version, if they had it from Aberrus and didnt update it wont work and you will get duplicate assignments
[7:42:02] Guffels: you would think smolderon would have solved these problems
[7:42:16] somerandomwowguy: It should have, perhaps not for tanks
[7:42:19] somerandomwowguy: But yea it should have
[7:44:36] Outsane: Does the liquid wa only prompt you to dispel if it's off cd or does it only assign?
[7:45:16] somerandomwowguy: Assigns and glows if dispel is off cd or on cd with 2 sec remaining
[7:45:37] thebestwarlockk: hey jb can you check if jackasaurous is playing time anomaly
[7:46:06] thebestwarlockk: ah nvm you are lusting on pull
[7:46:15] sgtshellshocka: I changed the remaining time on the dispel to .1 in the trigger tab, eliminates the double flash jebait
[7:46:43] maneatingpotato1: @Outsane That may be a triggering question.  LOL
[7:51:41] sacresacred: The pres evoker is pumping o0
[7:52:56] causese: is it neltharion all over again
[7:53:15] casualshame: Feels better then swifty?
[7:53:50] Bladetykon: Bladetykon subscribed with Prime. 
[7:54:26] casualshame: But more doable? Felt you where ready to give up on swifty :D
[7:56:21] somerandomwowguy: Does your rl stream?
[7:57:21] Protracks: the only bad parts of this fight are intermission and dispels
[7:57:32] Protracks: it is infinitely better than tindral which is one of the worst bosses ever made
[7:58:30] Protracks: yeah intermission is disc and mw
[7:58:51] casualshame: Yeah. Only doing HC but the dispeling... ~~
[7:59:04] somerandomwowguy: There shouldnt be a name bug
[7:59:26] Millenzz: def lots of opportunity to pump in intermission (balls will be hitting the boss and the raid will be taking infinite damage)
[8:00:15] Vitaraptor: Wsts penthyrs heal breakdown
[8:00:32] Protracks: blossom breath and bloom
[8:00:40] Protracks: probably 5% reversion
[8:02:27] Moonwalker_5: !drops
[8:03:42] Sokchoy: i heard my name im tuned in and youre third
[8:03:46] Sokchoy: the fuck
[8:03:47] monntuu: yall one tind?
[8:04:16] SCxFaytal: whats best pull?
[8:04:34] SCxFaytal: gotcha
[8:09:18] Sokchoy: im proud of you bud
[8:09:24] Sokchoy: but you didnt press uppies?
[8:09:48] Sokchoy: so maybe we could use those 4 talent poitns somewhere else
[8:10:09] Protracks: you afk that one
[8:10:16] Protracks: mistweaver main character moment
[8:11:09] AandJright: Have a Great day, yours truly, AJ
[8:11:45] Sokchoy: i thought MDI mythic plus competitor john dot babe would know hes a side character
[8:12:29] tolo987: RL is negative main character energy
[8:13:53] NeverEver1981: hey sir what is happening? did u quit mdi? just asking for a friend :D

[8:20:48] xC1B4: hey @jdotb is the tank trinket from fyrakk bis for rdruid in m+?
[8:21:34] NeverEver1981: need to watch a friend but before i do that... thank u jdot for all the fun in the mdi´s and much love
[8:22:21] kondelol: RAGEY
[8:30:30] keenxp: stop trolling jb R)
[8:34:22] galinhoo: is his weakaura saying NA or "and egg"?
[8:35:00] galinhoo: Also is this like one of those weeb speech patterns like a cat character that says "nyan" at the end of every phrase?
[8:46:15] WytherOK: will you stop
[8:46:25] WytherOK: my 25 mb/s is gonna make me neck
[8:46:26] somerandomwowguy: Thats probably like, 1% hps increase
[8:47:31] WytherOK: did the 2.5 lower your latency? 4Head
[8:50:05] somerandomwowguy: Clone frontals
[8:50:19] somerandomwowguy: A major part about getting p1 clean is to have people actively face those away from the raid
[8:59:39] flawlesslykun: how can i raid HC on 4 toons and not loot a single thing. how chat Madge
[9:08:53] Celissah: !best
