[0:20:57] m_dep: really the helmets last? I know for skiing you are supposed to get a new helmet after any head impact since its less protective afterwards
[0:20:59] reszyy_: you get slashed on your stick and it breaks
[0:21:01] ButterMyButts: ^^^same lol
[0:21:01] MacEleven: I saw your LA hat and it made me puke btw
[0:21:07] Gokee24: pro tip: buy prostock sticks, you don't get the warranty but you're essentially not paying for a second stick then
[0:21:12] Hxwkins: theres a much better market now for selling used hockey stuff too
[0:21:12] Gokee24: and if you do buy from the store
[0:21:20] MacEleven: Im a major canucks fan
[0:21:21] Gokee24: break it on the 29th day and bring it back to get the warranty
[0:21:26] JackOfAllApocalypses: @m_dep yeah, that's true of cycling too
[0:21:41] Kirapika: Hockey in the UK is no ice, only gnarled wooden sticks and grown men vs 12 year olds
[0:21:50] MacEleven: Easton has a 30 day warranty too. I use to do that with Synergys
[0:21:51] Scoops__: that sounds lowkey scummy o.O
[0:22:03] Scoops__: oh is it just a thing people do?
[0:22:04] Gokee24: don't think about the "pro" in the name at all
[0:22:10] Gokee24: all it means is that you're not getting a warranty
[0:22:13] Hxwkins: @MacEleven the zbubble? WICKED
[0:22:20] SneakyWoodPecker: Do you have your girlfriend's initials on your twig tho? Thats what the pros do
[0:22:25] Gokee24: also the patterns will probably be like P28 rather than kane or a last name of a player that uses it
[0:22:29] TroyStory__: professionals use like $400-$500 sticks.
[0:22:29] reszyy_: you 100% dont want ovis curve
[0:22:33] reszyy_: its fucking ridic
[0:22:45] Hxwkins: @SneakyWoodPecker if you dont have a polaroid of your girl folded up in the shaft of your stick do you even love her?

[0:23:15] NerdRagedOut: show true dominance, play with no curve and all wood. 🤣
[0:23:21] oresties: @Maximum Back in my day all those sticks would be illegal because of curve.
[0:23:57] Hxwkins: @Maximum how do we feel about survival having a build that some of the top hunters use that just doesn't use a cooldown?

[0:35:28] JamaBear: Max is here to fly around. everything else is secondary peepoHappy
[0:35:29] Lindorn_: sang still going strong right
[0:35:30] carmlost: Wow is cool until you want to get a life
[0:35:31] skeleguy: skeleguy subscribed with Prime. 
[0:35:35] gwenmh: are you excited more for ptr?
[0:35:35] asdasdasdasdasdasdasdads: we need WoW22
[0:35:36] Gamerhcp: big same
[0:35:43] CptGerryM: @larkhill Got it! Thank you so much!
[0:35:44] asdasdasdasdasdasdasdads: WoW 2
[0:35:47] jordaiin: max ever thought about doing pvp??
[0:35:55] ChuckBorrisSVK: Same
[0:35:59] kallisz: this patch is real good
[0:36:00] Camelbak21: True, but it's like 4 months until season 4, which is kinda depressing
[0:36:04] Hoaw: the gearing system is the best it's ever been by far
[0:36:05] fxtnerd: wow content draught  = return to final fantasy
[0:36:05] ShowDUH: @gwenmh fuck ptr we want Alpha/Beta lol
[0:36:05] kallisz: raid is mid tbh
[0:36:09] honeychonker: Theres nothing to do outside of keys though
[0:36:09] carmlost: Aug ruined the game
[0:36:10] Warpath2k: Is it a case of world 1st, and then nothing? Win or loose? Or do you feel if youd won the latest race youd be more into the other wow things like parsing etc? @Maximum
[0:36:14] XLchance_: next season is gonna be great m+ tho
[0:36:16] alarkin: this patch has been so good
[0:36:20] Asuo_: Next season is purely a m+ season for sure, the raids are a wash
[0:36:21] ThreesFG: We need cross realm M raid
[0:36:22] gwenmh: @ShowDUH well yeah that's what i mean lol\
[0:36:23] figgy640: I'm looking forward to season 4 since I missed first raid.
[0:36:25] deviljin____: isn't "WoW 2" just a marketing hype bs? Like we all know nothing would really change with the game
[0:36:28] JusticeDraws: it always feels like the game feels great towards the end of the xpac
[0:36:44] aclipsedh: we need to know the dungeon set
[0:36:46] starymnw: dinar system
[0:36:47] kallisz: @carmlost aug isnt as bad this season. no longer required. so to me aug is just a spec
[0:36:47] starymnw: goated
[0:36:55] doctorbatmans: I hope we get all 8 DF dungeon in season 4
[0:36:55] sfavci: hey max! I stopped playing wow after bfa and I am thinking about starting again but I am afraid of the amount of the things that has changed. Do you think it is a good idea ? @Maximum
[0:37:02] hedgeho_gg: they need to add seasonal affix s4
[0:37:03] doctorbatmans: (not dawn)
[0:37:06] SneakyWoodPecker: no affix weeks plz
[0:37:14] asdasdasdasdasdasdasdads: @deviljin____ changing the game is the purpose ... imagine WoW with Overwatch graphics and better combat
[0:37:16] JamaBear: @Maximum if they realese anything they wouldn't tell you bcoz of roguegate KEKW
[0:37:17] Hoaw: ngl i think blizzard will intentionally ruin the current gearing system so players keep longer subscriptions to farm gear
[0:37:21] ShowDUH: @sfavci the game hasn't really change drastically since BFA
[0:37:23] Hxwkins: delete bursting :)
[0:37:27] Hoshma46: are more people working on it this time than last time?
[0:37:30] kallisz: they need to try to remove affixes
[0:38:03] Orenria: Has the new poddyc come out? The evoker one?
[0:38:03] twinkieruler95: @Maximum how was your hockey game last night? dont konw if you have said anything about it yet did you cramp up?
[0:38:09] mozerra: kinda wanna some buffing affix
[0:38:12] deviljin____: @deviljin____ yeah that would be sick for a year, and then players would get bored again and find more things to complain about
[0:38:14] 3V3R357: are we really getting no tuning pass before 10.2.5 ???
[0:38:19] quarantedeux: they'll have to nerf healing for that
[0:38:20] Hxwkins: iykyk
[0:38:22] ChuckBorrisSVK: Wouldnt that break TGP?
[0:38:25] larkhill: the wow illuminati
[0:38:28] codydoubleu: monkaS big rogue
[0:38:32] TotallyNotRaien: (((they))) aka blizzard i guess
[0:38:32] Reydien: roguething?
[0:38:34] Nickystr1x: whats roguegate?
[0:38:36] ChuckBorrisSVK: it would be just who does these 25s faster
[0:38:37] hedgeho_gg: what is the rogue thing
[0:38:39] Asuo_: rouge-gate? the stuff that grows your hair back?
[0:38:41] Kirapika: the Tyran issues have been obvious for like 8 weeks now its harder to have not fixed it by this point
[0:38:45] ProfessorSollis: WHat was the rogue thing?
[0:38:47] nairb1: @ChuckBorrisSVK just go faster
[0:38:52] asurey20: would also kind of be good if leaving a key without finishing wouldn’t drop it by a level
[0:38:58] OG_Kawngi: Blizz PR unhappy
[0:38:58] asurey20: because of people just leaving in a pug
[0:39:00] ToxicLG: Hoping I'm wrong but I have a feeling they aren't really going to change much about m+ because most people are running 20s and under and don't run into higher key issues
[0:39:02] EvoAllNight: max is super smart i love you max
[0:39:11] Dochunk: CRAZY IDEA: What if support specs were reserved for the 21st man, who can quickly buff/debuff individual players/enemies/mechanics where their team needs it best?  Or would this solve nothing and create a need for a 22nd man? lol
[0:39:15] jerkmcgee: only uncapped aoe classes make it to high keys then right
[0:39:17] asurey20: maybe have it roll to a diff dungeon so people don’t spam try the exact same key
[0:39:40] kallisz: 27s feel fine atm, some things definetly scale a little too hard
[0:39:54] realdevv: I want to do faster runs, but i give up at around +25 cuz stuff is just way too annoying/hard hitting
[0:39:56] froztz: !AWproline
[0:39:57] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/-22INa
[0:39:59] gwenmh: i feel like 20s are perfect right now, so they can cook with higher keys
[0:40:05] ShowDUH: @Dochunk would 100% make a 22nd man
[0:40:12] Hoaw: archmage sol's cinderbolts are a menace on tyrannical
[0:40:14] kallisz: in 27s thing feels outplayable, even though i definetly dropped my enh shaman
[0:40:15] mihoa: in your opinion what is classed as a "high key"
[0:40:18] ChuckBorrisSVK: Yea but if you do a 25 in 15 minutes and the same 29key is 25 with 15 min timer then you just doing the same thing
[0:40:24] NVbrutal: hope dungeons didnt deplete you could only go up in level that way would make it alot easier to practice a certain key.
[0:40:27] trajk: !ui
[0:40:35] hammer__cc: i saw ur advice on how feral should get into keys, does the same principle apply for affliction locks trying to get into 25s lmao
[0:41:24] xoxotobie: when undercover raiding?
[0:41:40] larkhill: ret topping overall feels funny at lower levels
[0:41:49] Calebkaser: the whole “can we live” meta is way less fun than optimizing damage
[0:41:57] kallisz: theres few classes that can compete with mage or rogue, also wouldnt it just make comp more utility focused so you can kill bigger packs
[0:42:01] TheunGaming: you could actually create proper healing checks instead of simply 1shotting everyone
[0:42:10] Squats3: Squats3 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 35 month. nice
[0:42:11] splashz0r: the 27 pug wall is hitting me hard rn
[0:42:20] santalylth: cant have healing checks
[0:42:27] santalylth: remeber court of stars
[0:42:29] Ionized4: do you think the depletion system would need to change if they moved to a time based key level?  would feel real stupid to deplete and run the key with the same hp/damage
[0:42:35] user_name_null: @Maximum 100% agree keys arent fun when everything is a one shot if you dont have a defensive up
[0:42:38] santalylth: cant have one person bricking the key for people
[0:42:45] XLchance_: what about scaling to 25 and then your key turns in to a challenge mode where theres no time limit but youre competing for a time leaderboard
[0:42:49] antirace: bro these one shot mechanics in dungeons at higher keys have been rough as, makes pugging so toxic
[0:42:55] kallisz: it would kill most 7min+ bosses
[0:42:59] disquared: !awproline
[0:43:00] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/-22INa
[0:43:00] eggs_boiled: but wouldnt we face the same issues in a "can you dmg higher to beat the timer" ??
[0:43:03] Hoaw: doing damage is also more PUGGABLE, whereas organizing defensives is so much harder with a pug
[0:43:09] quarantedeux: but then it becomes about healer and tank damage for most of the key
[0:43:11] formation2252: compound scaling is frustrating, I'd prefer dungeons got like 5% harder per level, so what if people are doing 60's. A 5% increase would mean that a really optimised run may complete the key, but now you basically know what the wall is.
[0:43:13] jberry: last boss atal one shots at 25 for some classes  man thats peak unfun
[0:43:18] asurey20: I think tbf the “can you live” meta is predominant but for the rank 1 keys time optimization definitely still exists in places like rise
[0:43:18] guynormally: garf
[0:43:35] kallisz: healing is capped at 27-28s after that it just be dead or not dead
[0:43:43] asurey20: it’s just that needing to live even on a 28 just makes it so some classes will just never make it higher
[0:43:47] fsu_brooklyn: Next Podcast when? :)
[0:43:50] itsvizjira: you can always just stop scaling damage and continue scaling hp
[0:43:56] BadManners_: is infinite scaling bad game design ?
[0:44:10] mandbyvgc: makes sense since timer is rarely the reason a high key is failed
[0:44:12] fsu_brooklyn: nice, ty!
[0:44:13] santalylth: does every class need to be able to do world 1st keys
[0:44:16] quarantedeux: what about scaling interrupt windows in higher keys ?
[0:44:18] Kirapika: the new "will you survive" website thing is super interesting, like knowing the exact point you'll get one shot by stuff
[0:44:25] Calihotshot: what you planning on playing next season?
[0:44:27] kallisz: the best healing fights feel like the witches in wcm, council boss in eb and other bosses like that
[0:44:28] Klayjamin: it's friday
[0:44:31] Squats3: @Maximum ive been checking spotify for it =(
[0:44:41] larkhill: monk
[0:44:43] TotallyNotRaien: so extra damage should get capped and then to increase difficulty they should reduce the timer as the key level goes higher?
[0:44:44] NotD4k: do a 4 first mythic with ur monk and yoink tier
[0:44:45] pbnj_kills: enhance
[0:44:49] glitsmonk: are you surprised by the lack of class tuning in the .5 patch?
[0:44:55] santalylth: baldurs gate 3
[0:44:56] doctorbatmans: Most fun? Lol@ele season 3
[0:44:59] jerkmcgee: DH
[0:44:59] mrduckytom: well people are trying high keys with no healer comp atm
[0:45:00] user_name_null: @Maximum they could also do what d3 did a few years back for greater rifts,  monster damage scales much slower than monster health
[0:45:04] itsvizjira: @TotallyNotRaien can just increase hp, its same same
[0:45:11] codydoubleu: only 3 days left to vote i think, results should be pretty final if its not close
[0:45:21] reszyy_: destro lock time
[0:45:24] kallisz: enh is goated, just needs more defensives
[0:45:27] Hoaw: chat are we getting any talent changes in season 4?
[0:45:28] Zandrilx: same tbh
[0:45:31] Nickystr1x: if it did way less damage would you feel the same way?
[0:45:32] fzybny: Enhance time
[0:45:33] Zandrilx: most fun ive ever had playing retail
[0:45:34] b1azzuris: what makes havoc fun?
[0:45:40] b1azzuris: aside from big number
[0:45:41] Nickystr1x: not making assumptions just curious
[0:45:42] Squats3: i found a frost mage in a normal raid yesterday that just wasnt running glacial spike... the custom cooked builds are great
[0:45:44] tala____: Elem Sham of course Aware
[0:46:01] maxmorey: I like Feiline Stomp :(
[0:46:08] fzybny: That's why you have to vote for S1 WW set, you're not locked into Serenity/FLS.
[0:46:09] Jjmn12: Jadefire Stomp* Nerdge
[0:46:09] Hoshma46: @Squats3 isnt the tier set glacial spike related? HUH
[0:46:10] NC_Jake: How are we feeling on the amount of fun hunters are?
[0:46:11] BunnyOnMeth: Do you think it's a nice idea to cap scaling at 25 and then you give the choice to players to chose their own "affixes" like Heat in Hades
[0:46:13] Hxwkins: and bring back WDP
[0:46:17] jaydoeshair: going to set up a heroic raid?
[0:46:32] StreamElements: Maximum is now live! Streaming World of Warcraft: its friday just hangin out !AWproline Sponsored by Alienware

[0:46:41] Squats3: @Squats3 yes it is
[0:46:41] sorliee: edging gachiBASS
[0:46:44] ToxicLG: Might be fun content to run some keys with the cats with some fun gourmet talent builds
[0:46:45] sdjfn: Rogue?

[0:46:49] gwenmh: chat should be able to donate channel points until the start of s4 to choose your main
[0:46:52] Dzor12: It caps way before that

[0:47:06] wobfe: Enhance is great. I just hate ice fury
[0:47:13] Dzor12: Not saying its great lmao
[0:47:13] kallisz: wasnt feral season 1 good?
[0:47:14] Ghand0ur: Can anyone with enough coins do a "Dog Check"? OR @Maximum  can you do it for free?
[0:47:22] ChuckBorrisSVK: only 100 keys
[0:47:23] kallisz: 1200 just 100 timed keys
[0:47:24] Discard_TV: @Tsinis Storm build is more fun in keys but is dead with S3 tier.  Wish people were voting for S2 tier, but they aren't.
[0:47:28] Hoshma46: 1200 is just 100 keys KEKW

[0:54:39] Powzoar: Max, Reptar check?
[0:54:42] muonz: some guild took 900 pulls on post-nerf tindral
[0:54:44] b1azzuris: @TheunGaming including mine Pog
[0:54:51] Hoshma46: cant double soak them anymore
[0:54:52] Dochunk: My guild is still progging on M Smoldy, but next tier... we're for sure coming for that RWF
[0:54:52] gwenmh: he's getting lobotomized now
[0:54:57] Trodenskjold: @Powzoar he did 5 mins ago
[0:55:01] RayWoz: i just need cross realm mythic already. give away HOF
[0:55:06] gwenmh: he's a 1300 rating moonkin
[0:55:10] BadManners_: what do you even wipe to anymore ? KEKW
[0:55:14] Smarky123: So pissed.. just got to Tindral mythic roots 2 prog and the turbo nerf it
[0:55:22] chargerofkarma: there have to be alteast 5 people sleeping on the job for it to happen now, its insane
[0:55:39] mrduckytom: the no fyr nerf is weird :p
[0:55:51] Ghand0ur: Why is mythic raiding realm locked though?
[0:55:55] BadManners_: they should have just did -1 bomb + 2 less seeds
[0:56:30] angrycalf87743: ngl feel like the main reason why it is nerfed is because extreme fps/lag issues on all levels
[0:56:41] Hoshma46: groups are killing heroic fyrakk in P2 now with gear KEKW
[0:56:42] jeppe1152: does any of the tindral nerf now affect any other diff?
[0:56:52] NotD4k: its only mythic
[0:57:04] nedplanters: Only watched "How I went from world 5000 to First" Enjoyed it, we started around the same time. For some reason Kanye West - Stronger and Alicia Keys - New York bring back destinct memmories of my early wow days, do you have any songs like that for you from that era?
[0:57:07] Finkelberg: !ui
[0:57:30] Hemenia: nathria
[0:57:36] Hemenia: where they interrogated chinese players
[0:57:41] jerkmcgee: that was bfa
[0:57:42] reymargera: PepeLaugh
[0:57:42] nedplanters: nedplanters subscribed with Prime. 
[0:57:49] pokirane: om
[0:57:52] Gordiie: Nathria
[0:58:03] quarantedeux: SL S1 i think that was
[0:58:10] shogunmaster2: didnt they do that so they could sell mythic easier
[0:58:14] Ravaldknight: didnt netease message people in HoF and quiz them on fight mechanics
[0:58:17] Hemenia: "oh u have a ret with more gear? give me your bnet account" argus
[0:58:18] TheunGaming: oh dont worry it's happening again, the top non-taiwan disc player on fyrakk is like world 50+ KEKW
[0:58:31] NotD4k: nathria was a vibe
[0:58:59] Ok_Kingston: its so hard to recruit
[0:59:02] BadManners_: they think mythic lockout is good too PepeLaugh
[0:59:02] Basic_3: Cross Realm and Mythic Lockout changes asap, pls & thank you
[0:59:10] ganshruber: because they view it as a selling point for the war within
[0:59:16] Trodenskjold: Cant make it an expansion feature, if they do it now
[0:59:22] m_dep: At a certain point in the season they should remove mythic lockout
[0:59:23] trevj93: so that its a selling point for ww
[0:59:32] m_dep: Maybe its fine at the beginning? But why is it there for the entire season
[0:59:33] quarantedeux: probs tied to the x-realm guilds project team
[0:59:35] LifeMade3asy: LifeMade3asy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Pog
[0:59:38] TF0rd: people would cross realm to get mercenaries in from other guilds to get HoF
[1:00:02] jerkmcgee: it's probably something they cant tell you
[1:00:04] Clox9: why gate keep content from people ?
[1:00:07] Ghand0ur: Whgat is Blizzard's view about the lockout? No idea
[1:00:09] rtee1__: have you ever think about lfr normal and hc
[1:00:15] m_dep: It seems like such an easy compromise to remove mythic lockout halfway through the season
[1:00:16] FuchsiRA: @TF0rd isnt that fine?
[1:00:17] m_dep: why not
[1:00:22] Basic_3: They literally think the lockout helps pugs
[1:00:31] Reydien: clearly it would impact their RMT/token profits too much /S
[1:00:31] Miril9: they said the ywant people to commit to the pugs they join
[1:00:43] d0mezg4mer: they want you to play with the same people for mythic, not pug
[1:00:51] goblingher: smth smth people are more insentivised to rejoin the same group smth smth
[1:00:52] Erktraz: hurts pugs more then anything
[1:01:00] Synoshi: They should gear  lock 7 on ythic like heroic and nomal
[1:01:15] Sylphrene: Any info on maybe another interview? - Maybe to ask the ele raid buff quesion ;) ?
[1:01:19] ThreesFG: Hopefully they aren't doing it to prevent unholy WF stuff
[1:01:20] shogunmaster2: they want mythic to be a guild activity not a group finder/ community event
[1:01:27] TheunGaming: when your 1 dh is out and you just cant pull mythic bosses Sadge
[1:01:40] MeisterChiefX: pretty sure the group most hurt by lockouts currently are WF guilds lmao
[1:01:47] grimycc: Is Dragonflight worth playing now?
[1:01:52] Calihotshot: what changes would you see want to see come to mythic+ in War within?
[1:01:55] BadManners_: maybe i can see guilds skipping bosses entirely by just getting a lockout from someone and they dont want that ?
[1:01:56] swagggle: that's when a rich guild pays some mercenary DPS 1 million gold per hour to help them for the night XD
[1:01:57] imephissto: we got someone from group finde during sire prog :D
[1:02:00] ibjorgi: it prevents the idea of having a friend who raids different hours just coming to help you out if you need
[1:02:05] TheLoopsterr: fully agree. it killed my guild last seaon, its dumb as hell
[1:02:05] jerkmcgee: how would multiple lockouts affect loot?
[1:02:06] ekzsde: RMT mythic boosting would be wild if you can just repeat last boss mythic?
[1:02:08] fronkacean: some horde v alliance type beat
[1:02:17] m_dep: AT LEAST give us regular lockouts part way through the season
[1:02:28] Clox9: @ekzsde so ?
[1:02:31] Boreall: Is it because they don't want guilds doing early Mythic boss splits?
[1:02:34] imephissto: we got someone from group finde during sire prog back in SL @Maximum
[1:02:39] Maldre: its them trying to make mythic raiding some in crowd thing, like top end pvp
[1:03:03] user_name_null: @Boreall splits is a good take I hadnt thought of
[1:03:06] sepulchore: sepulchore subscribed with Prime.

[1:03:07] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/-22INa
[1:03:14] quarantedeux: Imagine doing Mythic splits for PIp's tho
[1:03:17] Hoaw: 95%
[1:03:18] Hergiez: Will you kill mythic Tindral and Fyrakk?
[1:03:19] FonkeeTV: 95%+
[1:03:19] AbieCherry: @Maximum the thing is blizzard doesn't think mythic should be pug friendly. so in the end it doesnt' matter to them
[1:03:19] Yidz: 99%
[1:03:19] m_dep: 99-99.5%?
[1:03:20] Donjuan_: 90%+
[1:03:21] m_dep: or more?
[1:03:23] m_dep: something like that
[1:03:28] ThreesFG: 420%
[1:03:31] Just1Time2: test it in s4
[1:03:31] Erktraz: it'd be a massive number increase ya
[1:03:34] m_dep: 99%+ for sure
[1:03:39] 16attempts: Mythic splits inc
[1:03:41] CPT_Lemons: Mythic lockout is also cancer for people who like to farm older content that isn't soloable
[1:03:46] goombacci: yeah it feels arbitrary
[1:03:52] reymargera: KEKW
[1:03:54] caveman2x: @AbieCherry i kinda agree with them
[1:03:59] shemdil: it's the death throws of classic
[1:04:03] pokirane: i think it'd be way more interested in mythic raiding if i could pug it like heroic, like meh im bored lets fuck around and try it.
[1:04:12] zeitgeiz: my guild had the GM leave and they had to reform. couldn’t raid this week as the other server recruits couldn’t work out transfers in time
[1:04:12] ibjorgi: @Maximum if they removed it it also makes trialing with new guilds easier
[1:04:13] RayWoz: the drop off from heroic to mythic has to be a wild stat
[1:04:13] kingpeace09: doing massive keys with new keyboard?
[1:04:17] Sylphrene: Any info on maybe another interview? - Maybe to ask the ele raid buff quesion  ;)  ?
[1:04:18] jerkmcgee: what do they do about loot with no lockout?
[1:04:18] Whitewolf1441: i feel like forcing it to be with your guild is so people wont cry for blizz to make it easier
[1:04:25] Hoaw: imagine if the start of every week u had to choose 4 players for m+ for the rest of the week, and you cant play with anyone else that week
[1:04:25] MeisterChiefX: youre definitely foregoing to mention that your guild would spam the hell out of early boss mythic splits
[1:04:27] FuchsiRA: you dont wanna join a team for mythic? go do delves idiot KEKW
[1:04:29] cptkaluh: im kinda wonder if you have been in pugs recently :D
[1:04:31] goombacci: exactly
[1:04:31] honeychonker: It hurts smaller 2 day guilds who have like 18 people, you can't mythic prog both days because good luck finding someone accepting a 3/9 lockout on the 2nd day
[1:04:33] quarantedeux: ngl daily mythic lockout doesn't sound too bad
[1:04:43] pokirane: @CPT_Lemons yea i hate this
[1:04:45] tarer: Give leavers a deserter buff kekw
[1:04:51] CaseysOn: Devils advocate... if your team is 25 people, two nights, but you can play 5 nights. You get 6/9 and your guilds only 4/9. That starts to feel bad maybe?
[1:04:51] volkreig: Thoughts  on if Blizz added a mini raid thats more difficult, akin to Crucible of Storms?
[1:04:52] Korupcija_: I used to pug Siege of Orgrimmar every week
[1:04:57] asurey20: I def think lockout makes a pug more likely to stick together but if the lockout didn’t exist there’d be significantly more pugs in the first place
[1:05:05] CaseysOn: I agree though, open it up.
[1:05:17] goombacci: the legion mini raid was cool too
[1:05:20] Calihotshot: what changes would you see want to see come to mythic+
[1:05:22] AbieCherry: @Maximum but to get BiS gear you should go out of your way to join a coordinated group
[1:05:23] Hoaw: chat did blizzard confirm cross-realm mythic week 1 in TWW? what happens to hall of fame?
[1:05:36] duhworks: mini raid season 4
[1:05:37] eternumwow: if you look at it the other way around it will lower the value of CE, considering high end guild can boost mythic daily isntead of weekly
[1:05:41] pnguinwow: would yall even compete in that?
[1:05:53] Suited_Monkey: I'm all for fated raids s4, I like raiding gimme more of it
[1:06:05] Vriplol: what about .5 patches
[1:06:12] Zalestine: mini raid between two long  raids?
[1:06:13] Hoaw: id rather have an uunat raid for season 4 instead of this fated BS
[1:06:23] Ghand0ur: Oh btw any idea how the gearing will work in season 4? Will Amirdrassil drop season 4 gear?
[1:06:25] Eiya: 107 raiders from Eiya have joined! 
[1:06:28] Gamerhcp: eiyaBoing eiyaBoing eiyaBoing eiyaBoing
[1:06:33] worldparachut: no matter what route they go people are gonna be mad its that simple
[1:06:39] Suited_Monkey: people rather have a 2 boss raid than a fated season? what are you all smoking lol
[1:06:40] Sylphrene: Any info on maybe another interview? - Maybe to ask the ele raid buff question  ;)  ?
[1:06:47] sepulchore: BibleThump
[1:06:49] cloudberrylive: @Maximum all 3 were bangers and helya's "dance" especially felt so rewarding to pull off
[1:06:52] FoxxGhostboi: ooof Adge
[1:06:55] the_inhumanatee: they should get metrics on what old raids are run, and then boost those @Maximum
[1:07:19] gwenmh: odin balance was incredibly bad for smaller raid groups, soured me on ToV completely
[1:07:22] wogcog: why would you wanna boost mythic all day
[1:07:29] Sylphrene: maximumChair
[1:07:32] eternumwow: would that however help you with guld and preparation for future races?
[1:07:37] eternumwow: gold*
[1:07:56] goombacci: in place of hero?
[1:07:56] BadManners_: Aware
[1:07:57] Basic_3: They could unlock it on week 3 or some shit to kill that
[1:08:01] sobayed28: WutFace
[1:08:03] Calihotshot: would you prefer mini raids, harder bosses more frequent, or regular 8-10 boss raids.
[1:08:04] m_dep: Do you think thats the *real* reason? That it would affect RWF viewing experience?
[1:08:08] shemdil: you would also have less helpers to use
[1:08:09] quarantedeux: yeah, let's keep mythic lockouts :'D
[1:08:12] MeisterChiefX: and you dont think that would be part of blizzards reasoning?
[1:08:20] RayWoz: 4 box for sure
[1:08:31] ThreesFG: Just keep the lockouts until first kill in region
[1:08:34] Boreall: It technically affects Method too
[1:08:35] sorliee: Aktchully its 3 with method Nerdge
[1:08:37] TL_izPanda: I don't want that from a race perspective lol
[1:08:57] m_dep: With how much viewership the race gets, I don't think it's crazy for them to make decisions that affect the race (I still think they should remove mythic lockouts)
[1:08:59] bru7al123: @Maximum have u done the flying challenges?
[1:09:01] ibjorgi: The RWF is also the most to watch on the last 3 bosses
[1:09:09] ibjorgi: who cares about what happens before hand
[1:09:10] Calihotshot: @maximum would you rather want mini raids, harder bosses, more frequent content, or regular raids?
[1:09:11] viggowiz: after each region 1st last boss kill into crossrealm + no lockout?
[1:09:18] RAF_Sean: That's a W take if I've ever heard one
[1:09:25] Clox9: I mean i dont mind if they roll in 2-3 weeks after
[1:09:31] quarantedeux: in terms of content iti's terrible too, like "oh they're finally pulling mythic bosses" "NOPE more splits"
[1:09:33] Hoaw: make mythic lockouts on like a 2-day cooldown instead of a weekly reset
[1:09:40] Miril9: 28 nov 2022
[1:09:40] reggiepowa: november 2022
[1:09:41] TL_izPanda: November 22
[1:09:42] Nickystr1x: watching you try to do week 1 mythic splits with viewers would be content i think
[1:09:45] Szain3: DinoDance
[1:09:45] viggowiz: october or sum
[1:09:47] Rally1098: November 22
[1:09:48] pokirane: 5 years ago Aware
[1:09:50] ShowDUH: Next Expac should be 3 raids of 6 months or so
[1:09:50] daiger5o: All trinkets drpped today i rolled less than 15 on all
[1:09:54] ShowDUH: it will be very good
[1:10:00] jeppe1152: Having looked around my realm for multiple weeks to find another guild that'd be willing to play with us to even start mythic due to lack of players make it very discouraging
[1:10:11] Mr_Schnoz: They used to release 3 raids at launch LOL, we're settling HARD
[1:10:12] gwenmh: they should reprise old raids for 10 man between tier for catch up content
[1:10:14] reggiepowa: and then in next 365 there will be only 1 in next expansion
[1:10:15] TL_izPanda: get ready for 365 days with 1 new raid
[1:10:25] rofustv: @Mr_Schnoz when other than vanilla
[1:10:29] keyda16: keyda16 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[1:10:32] Wincrediboy: is there any confirmation they're dfoing 18month expansions, or are we just guessing based on other things they've said?
[1:10:34] bru7al123: @Maximum i find fated is boring though, because its the same stuff.
[1:10:38] fronkacean: do u feel like the tindral nerf announcement timing is odd? i dont feel like showing up to raid sunday cuz we wont kill it and the boss will be vastly different wednesday
[1:10:41] pokirane: is fated pog or a cope
[1:10:41] Mr_Schnoz: they've set the standards so low people just expect fuck all now
[1:10:57] Mr_Schnoz: @rofustv TBC and Wrath all had 3 at launch
[1:10:58] the_inhumanatee: @Maximum would you enjoy a fully blind raid with no PTR/Testing?
[1:11:03] RAF_Sean: @Mr_Schnoz When did they ever relase 3 raids on the same patch?
[1:11:06] TL_izPanda: @fronkacean you don't feel like raiding anyway
[1:11:17] fronkacean: @TL_izPanda i do, raiding is fun :D
[1:11:24] reggiepowa: hopefully it's 18 months and not like 20-22 months
[1:11:27] rofustv: @rofustv you genuinely count those 1 boss raids as raids?
[1:11:31] Mr_Schnoz: @RAF_Sean TBC launch had 5 raids. Wotlk had 3 at launch. You just have no standards for Blizz now lol
[1:11:34] Clox9: bro fuck it add 2 bosses raid and make them hard af in s4
[1:11:35] pbnj_kills: should the 3 boss raids land in season 4 instead of in between tiers?
[1:11:39] Mactub: @TL_izPanda  TrollDespair
[1:11:48] MoleDude: announcing early is always better, you get to make your choice either way
[1:11:55] ibjorgi: yeah our guild killed smolderon and then said we aren't pulling Tindral since it's gonna be so different next week
[1:11:56] fronkacean: we are gonna go wipe to firebeams and seeds and theres no point talking about the wipes cuz they wont happen in 3 days
[1:12:01] basedjoke: Why are you not doing yt Guides for dh/Monk?
[1:12:01] Hoaw: a mini uunat raid >>> fated raids
[1:12:07] DiaDonnie: what weakaura are you using? it looks nice @Maximum
[1:12:12] Hemenia: it just feels like the nerfs are too big of a leap, boss goes from crazy hard to igira
[1:12:21] quarantedeux: !ui
[1:12:24] Aveeeeek: then u would say u wasted prog  day on monday if nerfs were announced on tuesday
[1:12:31] klugzy: depends on why you play, why your guild plays, what your objectives are, and what you find fun
[1:12:32] WowGrandma78: WowGrandma78 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Good afternoon Max and chat
[1:12:34] volkreig: What m+ changes would you like to see in the next expansion?
[1:12:34] Shikoroh: should we try reclear?
[1:12:34] DiaDonnie: !wa
[1:12:35] TL_izPanda: its a complete waste of time.
[1:12:36] mandbyvgc: pre nerf kill
[1:12:36] Big_Oakk: What would you rather do, Have them announce major nerfs when servers reset??? :Kekw
[1:12:41] BadManners_: if you just started maybe learning dispells and shit
[1:12:41] qt_girl_gamer: they should rework mythic raiding so it works like mythic +, just normal bosses with affixes that changes every week and a timer to clear the raid
[1:12:50] RAF_Sean: @Mr_Schnoz I mean, that's just wrong.
[1:12:56] NotD4k: its just hard mode heroic now
[1:12:59] Hoaw: if they double down on supports, would you like to see one of the hunter specs reworked into a bard support? @Maximum
[1:13:00] fronkacean: ye i think we just cancel sunday and go x3 next week instead
[1:13:02] CanielD: twice glass kinda guy Pog
[1:13:03] pepesm0kes: probably more
[1:13:04] Korupcija_: 50 pull boss
[1:13:04] lostamongliars: blizzard nerfs a boss, gets flamed - they don't nerf a boss, they get flamed
[1:13:05] Basic_3: Did we find out about the Fire Beam thing? Which one was removed?
[1:13:07] Lorrdzik: what is the nerf?
[1:13:09] Rambo0306: @qt_girl_gamer kek wtf it's your idea
[1:13:13] thenateo2: bring back p3 3 second seeds FeelsOkayMan
[1:13:14] pepesm0kes: its so sad. my guild just got to progging p2 consistently
[1:13:19] BadManners_: also p1 is a meme without that last flare
[1:13:21] sorliee: HAH got stuck
[1:13:22] mufchops: ya meeres said if a guild was going to pull 400+ times it will 100% be less than 100 now
[1:13:23] NotD4k: heroic seeds are prob harder than mythic seeds now
[1:13:28] b1azzuris: @pepesm0kes same but im hyped
[1:13:32] FuruF: @Maximum JB is about to at you :)
[1:13:39] Hoaw: if they double down on supports, would u like to see one of the hunter specs reworked into a bard support? @Maximum
[1:13:43] goombacci: where would nerfed tindral have landed on your ranking list?
[1:13:45] RAF_Sean: It's the 3rd one in P1
[1:13:48] Cuore22: 2nd one - the most impactful one
[1:13:50] cptkaluh: safe the 2nd beam
[1:13:50] Jjmn12: its gotta be the one on the big move
[1:13:53] fronkacean: if its the 2nd one its free
[1:13:55] KDaily: KDaily subscribed with Prime. 
[1:13:55] cptkaluh: which normally gets gated
[1:13:57] fronkacean: i hope its not second
[1:14:04] DjekHex: what prevents you from having immunes just soak all the seads now?
[1:14:04] thenateo2: default ui nick GIGACHAD
[1:14:09] b1azzuris: W TAKE
[1:14:10] Mr_Schnoz: @RAF_Sean You're right it was more! Kara, Gruul, Mag SSC, TK  and Hyjal were all at launch.
[1:14:12] Ghand0ur: I like that the backgtround music is someone farting
[1:14:18] cptkaluh: 1st is easy.. 2nd is the most worrying
[1:14:28] wavelink95: Hey guys i was just wondering about my paladin tank stats i think i have to much haste i'm at 45%
[1:14:48] fronkacean: if that ones removed u just lust pull right?
[1:14:52] Ghand0ur: @wavelink95 sim yourself
[1:14:52] basedjoke: basedjoke subscribed with Prime. 
[1:15:02] Basic_3: The first firebeam is important because it sets the mood for how fucked you are this fight
[1:15:16] cptkaluh: yeah safe :D
[1:15:54] Wordsw0rth: 4th beam has been the toughest for us
[1:15:55] mybootyisasnack: i have a massive movement every morning before i hop on my computer for work
[1:15:57] thenateo2: This part got rekt by last nerfs anyway @Maximum
[1:15:57] midiansgod: Good evening great people :) Evening Max
[1:15:59] cptkaluh: and it make totally sense, cause you can play p1 as p3 then
[1:16:04] fronkacean: i hope they keep that one and remove the last one
[1:17:12] BadManners_: lust on shield is still better i think, its like the raz shiled its good if you break it fast
[1:17:22] Wordsw0rth: u also wanna break shield early so u can move boss, otherwise u spawn shit in the middle

[1:17:48] KS_destroyEr: we lusted on pull
[1:18:11] BadManners_: @KDaily it breaks faster so its basically more boss dam
[1:18:57] KDaily: well arcane mage juicing up a big totm worth
[1:19:33] Wincrediboy: doesn't it not matter either way? the shield is damage you have to do, so it's effectively part of the boss hp
[1:19:36] Basic_3: That was always weird that Rasz would just AFK if you broke it early
[1:19:45] thenateo2: @KDaily and still doing shit damage LUL

[1:21:01] twotrapz: no
[1:21:01] Ghand0ur: Will season 4 render Amirdrassil useless?
[1:21:07] Wincrediboy: but even if the boss did start the phase then, it's still the same total damage you have to do? or is the point that there's no reason to speed up that part of the fight if it doesn't delay mechanics?

[1:53:08] magicman133: minty W
[1:53:11] Mourningztar: im currently off work for mental health, gooood times
[1:53:12] asd123qwerty1: firstGarf
[1:53:17] Jumanjiqt: Do you think theres people actively voting for other peoples worst tier bonuses to better their personal class?
[1:53:20] gdtomii: HOLY firstGarf
[1:53:22] OG_Kawngi: HOLY firstGarf
[1:53:23] greatangelsanguinius: icebaths are like the smallest gain tho
[1:53:30] ProBlocker: Kappa
[1:53:33] RiotDuskglade: You wouldn't catch me dead in an ice bath lmao
[1:53:34] ThisIzD: firstGarf
[1:53:37] Boreall: @Jumanjiqt Are you asking if THD voted?
[1:53:40] NotD4k: baseg
[1:53:44] risettefreya: @mourningztar hope you get better, I’m sorry to hear that
[1:53:48] gdtomii: yes but it wont be enough to sway votes
[1:53:49] Midguard: @Boreall LMAO
[1:53:55] Wincrediboy: is it bad aug set or just people voting S2 because aug was part of god comp in S2?
[1:53:59] Orange_SM: the bad ww set was winning
[1:54:01] asdkl2312k3o: @Maximum imagine if they do that with Aug only to giga buff the tier 2 set
[1:54:05] magicman133: @RiotDuskglade we might actually
[1:54:05] Reluctors: i was going to vote for the worst mage spec, but i didnt wanna hurt my mage buddies feelings
[1:54:06] Jumanjiqt: People are toxic enough to do it for sure ahahahha
[1:54:08] Genesis1_: balance getting fucked with a gutted set
[1:54:09] certified86: so the dont want to play chill streak. disappointed
[1:54:29] Maldre: i voted S1 ret because our guild has too many
[1:54:32] captainnetz: omg arcane season 2 tier set BatChest
[1:54:40] Thoreya: mages actually voted for the correct tier sets because mages are smart pog
[1:54:51] chefdejour82: people also might vote different  for pvp
[1:55:05] greatangelsanguinius: im gonna grief, anyone got a discord?
[1:55:14] Wincrediboy: yeah fronk stayed up all night editing it
[1:55:20] Thoreya: and tbh people are gonna vote more seriously towards tier sets than like dungeons
[1:55:22] Thoreya: like last time
[1:55:30] GnarstyTV: the laziness of toxic WoW players is severely under estimated.
[1:55:30] Exogenesis9: Ret came close to troll but EU saved it
[1:55:34] Thoreya: much more of a personal vote
[1:55:38] risettefreya: so what is this, you can vote on what tier bonus you have?
[1:55:56] Thoreya: @risettefreya for season 4
[1:56:01] misfitstv1: seems like a mutual understanding of “don’t mess this up or they could mess up mine”
[1:56:03] valdekius: the evoker said the aug was being griefed, but I don't think it was - a lot of players do not like the complexity of the current prescience play, and also in pvp the previous set was so much better for aug in many people's view, so it was a fair vote
[1:56:07] zuuggie: zuuggie subscribed with Prime. 
[1:56:10] dknamey: they should do that again
[1:56:19] Maldre: grimrail
[1:56:37] Slensch: it sucks
[1:56:39] Thoreya: u play with ur spec every single time u log in whereas dungeons, people who dont even do keys can vote, but do other content. its different
[1:56:43] wobfe: you never let the public vote. on anything
[1:56:51] captainnetz: sanguine

[1:57:10] Thoreya: iron docks was a banger
[1:57:14] BiggerAndBetterAbortion: i wanna see mega dungeons go to M+
[1:57:15] Thoreya: straight up
[1:57:15] iiamBaro: do we know what dungeons are gonna be on Season4  ?
[1:57:23] Midguard: Iron docks is bIS
[1:57:28] zeitgeiz: that’s why it was troll, people knew how bad it would be
[1:57:34] Thoreya: docks was siiick
[1:57:43] nemziac: "i like trains, theyre cool"
[1:57:46] deviljin____: What was ever wrong with Blizzard devs making decisions about the game? Its certainly better than community
[1:57:50] BlazinHurricane: choo choo
[1:57:53] shoneshaman: @Maximum season affix for s4 yes/no ? didn't see any announcements
[1:58:35] goombacci: I have the same view, but only because I hate aug enough to vote for it to fail
[1:58:36] Hergiez: people are screwing over augs tho

[1:58:44] irishbsd: I wonder are people voting on what was more fun or what was stronger ...??
[1:58:44] Drazerk: EU has more people who push higher keys
[1:58:50] Hoaw: @Hergiez good, no?
[1:58:52] Slensch: na has more votes
[1:58:52] gdtomii: EU push more high keys
[1:58:58] Kawatteruwow: Climate
[1:58:58] Exogenesis9: EU trolls less
[1:59:01] vingik: NA dumber
[1:59:14] gdtomii: KKona
[1:59:17] deviljin____: theres a lot of people in NA that doesn't even play the game but browse forums for whining and trolling
[1:59:24] BigCizzle: KKona hell yea
[1:59:26] Midguard: in EU your more likely to own a computer KEKW
[1:59:27] spiriteddecay: @deviljin____ same with eu brother

[1:59:46] deviljin____: @deviljin____ more on NA
[1:59:47] Spinerek: overcooked
[1:59:58] glockateerwow: @Docaan what about it?
[1:59:59] muzzaie96: does it really matter about which spec is better or not when they were current? isn't it all gonna depend on tuning
[2:00:01] Ok_Kingston: @BiggerAndBetterAbortion I always game with OCE to temper my powers. 300 ping keeps my power from overloading the game
[2:00:09] BiggerAndBetterAbortion: @spiriteddecay im australian ill headbutt you for no reason
[2:00:11] Docaan: @Docaan Detected the fortnite player
[2:00:13] WillowWeeks: What is CN getting for bonuses? I wonder if they're getting selection ingame...
[2:00:27] glockateerwow: @Docaan COD you mean
[2:00:31] oneifbyland: NA more voters
[2:00:36] captainnetz: @Maximum look at dev evoker for crazy na vs EU numbers
[2:00:36] mi_dude: USA USA

[2:00:58] m_dep: frost is bad and eu is good
[2:00:58] itsvizjira: this might just have not been advertised as much in eu
[2:00:59] Shpicey: NA used to voting
[2:01:01] captainnetz: Keep in mind a lot of EU players have NA forum accounts
[2:01:03] deviljin____: @iiamBaro this

[2:01:06] Sch1ey: Usa got democracy thats why we can vote. Kkona
[2:01:07] 2022LINKS: eu not used to voting
[2:01:08] zebajin: Eu dont play blood dks
[2:01:10] GnarstyTV: @Shpicey beat me to it
[2:01:12] Exogenesis9: EU also made NA characters for NA forums
[2:01:13] BurtikShaun: the link blizzard posted was US link, if you are an EU gamer you probably just gave up when it didnt work
[2:01:14] Korupcija_: forum users are low on EU
[2:01:18] snarky03: aus and TW?
[2:01:20] dorki: lot more na casuals and forum users
[2:01:23] Drazerk: Most EU people use NA forums cus ours get ignored
[2:01:23] Whitewolf1441: wow was around before america was discovered thats why
[2:01:24] goombacci: voting is not on wowhead chat
[2:01:31] gdtomii: EU people dont use forums as much
[2:01:33] Shakakahn9: honestly that feels right lol
[2:01:33] deviljin____: EU players are too busy playing the game,
[2:01:36] Camelbak21: Cause blizzard doesn't care about EU forums they never get used
[2:01:39] shoneshaman: @Maximum people in EU play better and care more abotu their own performance but on average are far less knowledgeable on WoW news
[2:01:39] captainnetz: Yea Eu make NA accounts to forum post because no one reads EU forums normally
[2:01:44] herptyderptyqwerty: facts
[2:01:45] m_dep: NA is more degen for participating on forums?
[2:01:45] wobfe: the EU forums are not being used as much
[2:01:51] Tanklock: streamers trolling getting their followers to vote for "fun" stuff
[2:01:56] xxoutkastedxx: lol no
[2:01:57] Birbmang_: we all just quit already
[2:01:58] vingik: Blizzard doesn't read eu forums
[2:02:00] nemziac: easier to go hardcore as a streamer when you have universal healthcare
[2:02:03] Guinnessgodx: im eu just cant be arsed keep forgetting
[2:02:10] goombacci: I heard it from you
[2:02:12] ItchY_val: discords for sure
[2:02:17] healapotamus: how my guild found out
[2:02:19] Joneim: My guild just links to patch notes, nobody cared about the vote
[2:02:20] fdb33: I found it from raiding discord linking it
[2:02:20] Dilgi_: i voted on na forums from eu
[2:02:21] HoneyBadger_DE: in EU you can only vote in the english eu forums... not in the other forums (spanish, german)
[2:02:22] itsvizjira: i wouldn't know about this if not watching your stream
[2:02:23] oneifbyland: @m_dep community voting on class sets = degen? monkaHmm
[2:02:23] TheunGaming: i linked it in discord and they voted against what i said KEKW
[2:02:25] jonpelf: ppl are still gonna raid tho even if rtwf is nbd, so they'll vote
[2:02:34] Freezy2371: @Maximum I didn't even know EU forums existed, I'm eu but when I go to forums I get the us URL
[2:02:34] Myotosis: blizzard a lot of the time only post on NA forums so we EU peeps have given up on the forums
[2:02:34] JukeboxHey: Im EU I voted on US forums
[2:02:47] googlan: We have a small discord with around 40 people and we all voted for each others specs tiers
[2:03:03] crickyb24: EU don’t need to vote bc they’re smart and pick the right sets rather than N.A. fighting for their life vs casuals
[2:03:05] larkhill: ret S3 winning Sadge
[2:03:06] Scargon231: do you think it could be because we haven’t imported freedom to eu, so they don’t know about voting?
[2:03:06] Firenze32: people voting ret s1 are straight trolling
[2:03:10] m_dep: @oneifbyland no, but forums in general is pretty degen, and thats where this is taking place
[2:03:13] NotD4k: playstyle wise s2 is the worst
[2:03:16] frostistake: s3 was and is
[2:03:16] moash_: Same thing happened with pres tier

[2:03:54] Joneim: Kappa
[2:03:56] dogjorts: destro is picking the boring one. pretty sad about that
[2:03:57] NotD4k: s2 is just rng
[2:03:57] Shpicey: how many are not going s3
[2:03:59] CoffeeASAP: surely lol
[2:03:59] goombacci: they would always do that if that was the case
[2:04:00] m_dep: but if that was true wouldnt they have tuned it up in season 2?
[2:04:01] Freezy2371: Surely.
[2:04:05] Joneim: Clueless
[2:04:05] Moai: thats bait
[2:04:11] null_sheen: if it was broken then... it'll be broken now right?? COPIUM
[2:04:12] Jumanjiqt: which WW monk is winning?
[2:04:17] Ukahen: look at how piss poor the balancing has already been for this tier
[2:04:17] Jumanjiqt: I enjoyed s1 a lot tbh
[2:04:20] Ukahen: i aint trusting shit
[2:04:27] Joneim: PepeLaugh
[2:04:28] Moai: 0 KEKW

[2:04:42] mezzasalma: !settings
[2:04:43] savarunl: @Ukahen what? m+ this season is more balanced than ever before
[2:04:45] m_dep: @Maximum I interpreted that as "they will tune them all up to s4 ilvl" not that they will tune them differently than they did previously
[2:04:46] Dzor12: Season 1 isn't an option @jackiell
[2:04:51] fdb33: Maximum couldn’t they easily try to balance this and then over nerf a previously powerful bonus though
[2:04:52] valdekius: It wasn't trolling
[2:04:53] goombacci: I did
[2:04:55] NotD4k: @jackiell they were not out then Dentge
[2:04:58] cptkaluh: ya forum was full of trolls

[2:05:25] caveman2x: GIGACHAD THD
[2:05:26] BigCizzle: GIGACHAD
[2:05:28] Boreall: So what you're saying is every single person in your stream went to vote Season 2 for Aug, we'd screw over Augs? (I'm not an Aug hater, I just like chaos)
[2:05:40] Dzor12: LOL
[2:05:41] Canwestop: that's like one of the takes with THD i agree with lmao, fuck aug
[2:05:41] xhriiis: there are no EU dragons I guess
[2:05:42] sppttv: A vote for S1 aug should be a vote to delete the class.
[2:05:45] Dzor12: Nobody cares about Dev

[2:17:20] JukeboxHey: SP movement KEKW
[2:17:25] The_Shade_Tree: @Maximum why do you think Class discords have such differing opinions and sometimes beef with high end raiders and keyers.

[2:19:29] erdls: meeres owning as unholy
[2:19:33] dango0n: but DK has AMS
[2:19:33] gretriku: @maximum he said 2nd because the top DH is only 60 IO ahead of the top DK lol
[2:19:36] ungnyaa: love being a wheelchair
[2:19:36] nemziac: tank pulls around the unholy and they top ez too
[2:19:43] Slensch: i hate pet classes
