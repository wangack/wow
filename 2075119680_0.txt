[1:31:20] Sebleh: so is now the time to tell you that your noise gate is way too low? naguuraSip
[1:31:57] Sebleh: voicemeeter banana might work for you

[1:32:05] Pizzakatong: @Sebleh LUL
[1:32:21] Kuroz: she had voicemeter banana before
[1:32:26] Kuroz: in advance
[1:32:48] Pizzakatong: and doing the EQ thing etc. in OBS on the mic track?
[1:32:59] Pizzakatong: with free equalizer plugins etc.
[1:33:20] Sebleh: I’m pretty sure you can set the mic filters on obs instead of your audio mixer btw

[1:34:10] josephrt10: moraisLoveP moraisOlaa moraisLovee
[1:34:44] y0rge: you dont need stuff liek this get 100-200$ maxz
[1:34:47] Pizzakatong: you can use any free equalizer VST and use it in OBS
[1:35:27] Pizzakatong: its only software then
[1:35:38] Pizzakatong: so, i think, its more intuitive, when you have an analog thing
[1:35:48] Pizzakatong: but, at the end, you want just set it once
[1:35:52] demonicus94: the goxlr is also very popular isnt it?
[1:35:54] Sebleh: if you have the stream deck with the knobs you can probably adjust the obs equalizer with that
[1:35:58] Pizzakatong: and dont play with it several times
[1:36:01] JohnnyOneLung: remember that a lot of people will use these things with analogue inputs and digital just isn't an option: hence the higher price jump from digital to physical
[1:36:05] y0rge: is same only less fancy
[1:36:25] Pizzakatong: but equalizer VST are very powerfull and in that case much better than an analog EQ
[1:36:27] Pizzakatong: you can effort
[1:36:28] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:36:33] JohnnyOneLung: just remarking on why it costs 100s
[1:36:36] JohnnyOneLung: I got a Yamaha one that I'm super happy with
[1:36:49] Pizzakatong: when you know the right EQs
[1:36:56] Sebleh: correct
[1:36:57] desaja: @naguura the one is Digital the 700 and this is analog
[1:36:58] StreamElements: Check out the Warhammer 40,000 special pack for PowerWash Simulator. The DLC is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Steam. https://bit.ly/PWW40k_Naguura #ad
[1:37:04] Pizzakatong: uhm, then you have to do the routing in voicemeeter banana
[1:37:17] Pizzakatong: or other cable routing software where you can use VSTs
[1:37:26] Pizzakatong: but, yeah analog would be easier in that case
[1:37:34] Pizzakatong: only software can be much more complicated
[1:38:19] menheten200: you dont
[1:38:44] Pizzakatong: yep
[1:38:52] Pizzakatong: or the rhode things or the mini go xlr
[1:38:59] Pizzakatong: or how it is named
[1:39:02] Pizzakatong: Gomini XLR
[1:39:03] Pizzakatong: so
[1:39:10] Aval0nTV: Differenz between a VST EQ and a dedicated device is, that all encoding is done on the device instead of using your cpu to encode.
[1:39:12] Pizzakatong: there you have "advanced" sotware in that thing
[1:39:23] Aval0nTV: Are you already using a xlr mic?
[1:39:30] Kuroz: !mic
[1:39:30] StreamElements: Rode NTG2 shotgun mic / Beacn mix create - Elgato Wave Mic Arm Low Profile // Kitchen/IRL streams : Rode wireless GO II, Rode NTG2 shotgun mic
[1:39:33] JohnnyOneLung: mine comes with funny filter settings which, of course I paid 20 more euro for than the standard edition LUL
[1:40:11] Zirconn__: guten morgen yall
[1:40:13] JohnnyOneLung: oh if you don't have an XLR mic, make sure these can take usb.  I was surprised a lot didnt
[1:40:29] Kuroz: can't wait
[1:40:32] Sebleh: suing kit? America style
[1:40:34] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[1:40:34] RichardPPPan: Pog
[1:41:07] Aval0nTV: So you could buy a stream deck + und use elgatos wave link software and put an eq in there so it works for all sources instead of OBS only
[1:41:39] Druzlek: When is the next soldering stream?
[1:42:36] maalcromlol: NOTED
[1:43:27] Sebleh: Analog thing
[1:43:39] Aval0nTV: Another idea would be to look at the beacn mic
[1:43:42] Aval0nTV: LUL
[1:43:58] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[1:44:04] Sebleh: The beacn mic is trash
[1:44:07] Sebleh: It shuts off randomly
[1:44:09] Zirconn__: I had a Behringer Xenyx 1204 mixer that I used once upon a time where I wanted to try to stream, it worked well
[1:44:30] Pizzakatong: understandable LUL
[1:44:34] Sebleh: I am not sponsored by them, I can say that naguuraSip
[1:44:41] YionLi94: Hey caro & Chat
[1:44:45] Aval0nTV: @Sebleh Really? I have some friends who use the mic and they haven't mentioned problems like this!
[1:44:50] Zirconn__: KEKW
[1:44:57] Sebleh: Did you never replace the cable?
[1:45:00] Ikarus_77: i had a elgato card that fried my PCI connection on the mainboard
[1:45:20] Sebleh: Are you telling me you went with an entire new microphone instead of just replacing one cable? HUH
[1:45:33] Aval0nTV: To be fair, such problems can happen with ANY manufacturer
[1:45:46] mika01: a box
[1:46:13] mika01: yea that's an issue
[1:46:20] Aval0nTV: But even the goxlr has dedicated software to run with it
[1:46:20] ItsAcorns: a elf?
[1:46:22] Pizzakatong: the software thing is... it can be very annoying when some windows updates just manipulate some things in the audio settings and you have to setup the whole thing again or find the error... had that 3-4 times in half of a year, it was so annoying
[1:46:28] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:46:28] Sebleh: oh god yeah the audio channel routing just gets randomly fucked on obs
[1:46:42] Nazuti96: when you go off software there is no turning back
[1:46:50] Pizzakatong: so analog thing is more robust and reliable
[1:46:55] nyshindysheen: BibleThump

[1:47:00] RichardPPPan: THEVOICES
[1:47:01] Pizzakatong: but the good thing costs <.< ^^
[1:47:29] mika01: windows things
[1:47:37] Nazuti96: the only issue i found on analog things is the amount of cables
[1:47:46] RichardPPPan: hardware perma memory better than software temp memory i c
[1:47:48] Nazuti96: but if you can deal with it, go for it
[1:47:56] Aval0nTV: @Pizzakatong You should use an app called Ear Trumpet for windows. It safes your routing settings and updates can't break it anymore!
[1:48:01] Sebleh: one of my VODs got DMCAd because my music audio in OBS got reset to "default" and the music was in the VOD. I fixed it all and a week later I had to set the music audio settings again in OBS seblehDespairge
[1:48:32] Pizzakatong: @Aval0nTV never heard of it, i will look at that, thanks :3
[1:48:41] Aval0nTV: You are welcome
[1:48:52] Nazuti96: or a sound interface like a foucsrite
[1:49:04] Sebleh: voicemeeter should do it yeah
[1:49:35] Nazuti96: its more for the mic
[1:50:00] Aval0nTV: ATM I personally would buy either the rode procaster duo if physical faders are needed or the rode x streamer x
[1:50:00] Sebleh: it does audio things naguuraSip
[1:50:10] throwmasterlol: it costs money, hope that helps!
[1:50:13] Raggu2: it could hold down some loose paper
[1:50:24] Pizzakatong: so in the first case, this thing grab external audio signal (mic, guitar) and puts it into the computer
[1:50:30] Nazuti96: its gives "power" to the mics, there is some mics that need some amp to have some quality sound
[1:50:35] Folius: "It enables recording and playback of audio signals from microphones, instruments, and speakers, enhancing sound quality for tasks like music production, podcasting, and live streaming."
[1:50:42] Pizzakatong: so you can work with that - it is also a "digital mixer"
[1:50:52] Aval0nTV: The focusrite converts the analog mic signal to a digital signal you pc can "understand"
[1:51:02] Gnolde: does something need soldering again? naguuraSip
[1:51:06] Nazuti96: but do you have an xlr mic?
[1:51:08] Nazuti96: or an usb?
[1:51:23] Pizzakatong: primarily when you have an XLR mic
[1:51:26] Pizzakatong: and not a usb mic
[1:51:40] Zirconn__: unless you have an XLR microphone, the focusrite is doing fuck all for you
[1:51:41] Aval0nTV: Yes
[1:51:44] Nazuti96: yeah, sort of
[1:51:45] Pizzakatong: primary purpose, yes
[1:51:55] AlsoZen: Useless?
[1:52:14] Elandrya: an xlr mic so it has a use
[1:52:18] Gnolde: what do you buy? an xlr microph one to got wit h it?
[1:52:20] Gnolde: KEKW
[1:52:21] Zirconn__: as long as it has it has a USB plug
[1:52:22] Peekzn: !key
[1:52:22] StreamElements: Time naguuraPog to naguuraPog watch naguuraPog my naguuraPog grill naguuraPog nagura naguuraPog deplete naguuraPog some naguuraPog keys
[1:52:25] Nazuti96: but the yamaha also need an xlr mic
[1:52:31] Aval0nTV: A software eq yes
[1:52:41] Gamerhcp: :d
[1:52:49] Aval0nTV: But it also needs software.
[1:52:54] Nazuti96: i think that tou cannot plug an usb mic
[1:52:57] Aval0nTV: Its not just the device and thats it
[1:53:12] Nazuti96: (sorry for bad english, im from Argentina)
[1:53:17] Pizzakatong: because you have an usb mic, you always have to route your mic audio signal to that device
[1:53:22] AlexGarlea: Hey, I've worked in sales for 8 years also in audo engineering, popped into the stream now, what do you need?
[1:53:24] Aval0nTV: That device is not for a usb mic!
[1:53:26] xstealthlol: I absolutely guarantee you Swifty has the answer to this, he did the entire gaming house and now an arcade. ask him what he would use
[1:53:31] AlsoZen: @Pizzakatong This
[1:53:34] Pizzakatong: to tunnel it throguh this device
[1:53:40] Pizzakatong: so its also a "meh" solution

[1:55:48] Tuze42: what kind of macro do you use for balance if you dont mind me asking?
[1:55:50] holly3d: GoXLR ans Sm7b and ur finee
[1:55:50] Pizzakatong: @Catevolved2 KEKW
[1:55:56] AlsoZen: He had another question
[1:55:59] Pizzakatong: @Catevolved2 dabei spiel ich nichtmal WoW vernünftig LUL
[1:56:01] LillJuggen: This cameria qualtiy looking crisp
[1:56:02] Gamerhcp: its a bit
[1:56:04] Gamerhcp: for sure
[1:56:05] Gnolde: "I can buy another Mike" - the echo team when Preach is not available for rtwf KappaHD
[1:56:08] Zirconn__: it’s always a bit
[1:56:12] Aval0nTV: I wouldn't buy a GoXLR anymore since it is no longer supported by TC Helicon!
[1:56:12] AlexGarlea: Best quality you can get is a XLR microphone. Most streamers and podcasts use Shure SM7B. You need a pre-amp for that microphone. You can plug it into an usb interface or into a analog mixer with usb.
[1:56:26] turnnex: switch from Usb to aux or xlr
[1:56:28] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:56:29] Im_Guu: @holly3d +1 this is the most used setup for streaming.
[1:56:37] Sebleh: Naguura you didn't read my message about the mixer doing audio things and honestly I'm either offended or this MUST be a bit those are the only two options possible seblehWeird
[1:56:48] Zirconn__: guys
[1:56:56] Nazuti96: then you can use your focusrite interface
[1:56:58] StreamElements: Check out the Warhammer 40,000 special pack for PowerWash Simulator. The DLC is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Steam. https://bit.ly/PWW40k_Naguura #ad
[1:57:00] Zirconn__: yall are just gonna confuse the fuck outta her lmao
[1:57:01] Sebleh: @Zirconn__ Its a bit what? naguuraSip
[1:57:09] AlexGarlea: Yea, but the Focusrite doesnt have any EQ, compressor on it
[1:57:12] Gamerhcp: seblehWow
[1:57:32] Aval0nTV: EVERY EQ would be software that you need to use in addition to the physical device
[1:57:32] AlexGarlea: Why would you like phisical control for comp and eq? You can basically use a digital one on your PC i tthink
[1:57:35] Pizzakatong: the first answer could be "how much do you wanna spend" LUL
[1:57:39] Nitwise: Hey Naguura ! playing wow today?
[1:57:39] Pizzakatong: questen
[1:57:43] Pizzakatong: question, sry ^^
[1:58:05] AlexGarlea: Alright, I got it .
[1:58:08] Sebleh: We're going Voicemeeter Banana for software
[1:58:13] Sebleh: I think that's what she said
[1:58:18] AlexGarlea: Let me research the market for a bit. The one you are looking at is a good choice.
[1:58:33] Nazuti96: if i understood well, she wants to swap from soft to phisical hardware. And needs some help to see what to buy
[1:58:44] faulen: I think you can put the larger AUX in that XLR hole in the middle. But don't quote me on that.
[1:59:02] Zirconn__: I’m like 99% Annie has a SMB7 and an audio similar to the focusrite, you could ask her later naguuraSip
[1:59:11] Zirconn__: audio interface*
[1:59:38] AlexGarlea: Rode Rodecaster Duo is something you wanna look at.,
[2:00:00] Im_Guu: GoXLR is widely used with the Smb7 otherwise can go, With the RODECaster Duo
[2:00:02] faulen: The EQ is usually a separate piece of equipment.
[2:00:38] AlexGarlea: This is an more expensive one than the Yamaha one you were looking at.
[2:00:52] Pizzakatong: when you go to that pricerange, you also could get an Behringer X18
[2:01:02] Pizzakatong: which has really powerfull eq,comp etc
[2:01:19] AlexGarlea: Boss GCS-5 Gigcaster5 I see it's something new you might wanna check it out
[2:01:20] arthpvp1: hi
[2:01:25] AlsoZen: Oh cool
[2:01:25] Sebleh: I know Midnababy uses a Shure mic with a physical pre-amp and voicemeeter banana for her stream setup.
[2:01:29] AlexGarlea: Yea, you basically need 1 XLR input, not 4
[2:01:32] Pizzakatong: i dont know how good are the EQ settings on that rode thing
[2:01:40] Sebleh: if that helps naguuraSip
[2:01:42] AlexGarlea: You have to buy the smallest one as inputs number but with all the features you want
[2:01:53] Zirconn__: brb meeting
[2:02:12] AlexGarlea: I would not recommend Behringer since it's a budget company, unless you buy something like a X32 Compact or something which is like 2000 euros
[2:02:13] faulen: Those don't have an EQ
[2:02:20] Pizzakatong: @AlexGarlea more is always better KEKW
[2:02:23] Pizzakatong: LUL
[2:02:29] Nitwise: could you really over kill? how many feeds of audio do you want and what’s the cost of the little one 😏
[2:02:34] alanextv: this isn’t power wash simulator, this is some sort of audio deck
[2:02:39] faulen: I dont think so
[2:02:44] AlexGarlea: Yamaha MG12XUK is something more "classic" but it takes alot of space.
[2:03:05] Starrren: Hello all
[2:03:19] faulen: Sorry, I was wrong
[2:03:26] faulen: I was looking at something different
[2:03:32] Burnprof: can't wait to see DJ Naguura
[2:03:37] Sebleh: I think it does yes
[2:03:38] RichardPPPan: soon turning dj remixing streamer? Scared
[2:03:40] Nazuti96: sorry, i have a meeting, i will come back in 10 min
[2:03:42] AlexGarlea: I would probably choose something from Rode because they are specialised on streaming/podcasting products.
[2:03:58] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[2:03:58] Sebleh: There's a plugin for it https://apps.elgato.com/plugins/com.barraider.voicemeeter
[2:04:01] AlexGarlea: Check Boss GCS-5 Gigcaster5 as well.
[2:04:48] AlexGarlea: I hear OBS has something
[2:04:50] faulen: The Rode's do have an EQ I was on the wrong page. They have a three-band equaliser for each channel
[2:04:58] MaxGrandpre: you could try Logitech Mixline I guess, at this point. It's made to split audio specifically. I didn't try it myself tho
[2:05:02] Sebleh: @AlexGarlea she wants something that mods her mic on her whole PC
[2:05:03] Burnprof: I would guess that professional audio software is aa thin
[2:05:12] AlexGarlea: Voiceemeter
[2:05:17] Aval0nTV: Personally ii love the wave link software but thats not an option so you could look at the steelseries sonar software or software that comes with a device
[2:05:31] Pizzakatong: voicemeeter can use VST plugins yes
[2:05:41] Sebleh: If Voicemeeter is like Elgato, it should give you a mic input to use that's filtered through the software
[2:05:42] AlexGarlea: I don't really know since I have no experience in streaming software, but I was glad to recommend you products for the best audio quality you can get.
[2:05:55] AlsoZen: ty Alex!
[2:06:02] Im_Guu: @faulen Yep, they do have EQ and several processing options, I got the CasterDuo for a friend that wanted to do something similar than what @Naguura asked for.
[2:06:06] MaxGrandpre: not all softwares are made equals tho
[2:06:08] AlexGarlea: You should probably just buy the Rodecaster, you can get a used one if you find
[2:06:21] Nitwise: warhammer later? :O
[2:06:22] AlexGarlea: And all the controls are on physical touch and you should not have any issues with it
[2:06:25] OdyssaQ: HI Naguura, Hi Chat KonCha
[2:06:28] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura

[2:06:59] GlacierRays: If only GoXLR hadn't abandoned their devices and didn't have so many problems
[2:07:08] AlexGarlea: You can use any microphones for it
[2:07:16] Pizzakatong: can i send you a dm?
[2:07:18] AlexGarlea: What microphones do you have
[2:07:25] AlexGarlea: I will tell you the best
[2:07:32] Pizzakatong: 2 vids how to setup vst plugins in voicemeeter
[2:07:40] Brainraid: YouTube speak german right? Have you checked out Musikhaus Thomann or something similiar? They got analog and digital sound mixer
[2:07:49] Kuroz: !mic
[2:07:49] StreamElements: Rode NTG2 shotgun mic / Beacn mix create - Elgato Wave Mic Arm Low Profile // Kitchen/IRL streams : Rode wireless GO II, Rode NTG2 shotgun mic
[2:08:00] Kuroz: I removed the old ones
[2:08:01] Sebleh: Why not use the elgato mic with the other software?
[2:08:17] Kuroz: wait...
[2:08:21] Kuroz: I had that one
[2:08:25] Kuroz: and you made me change it
[2:08:28] Kuroz: to ntg2
[2:08:32] Kuroz: oh
[2:08:59] AlexGarlea: You actually have good microphones for recording, the shotgun microphone tho would be good for  streaming. Just go with any xlr mic
[2:09:07] AlexGarlea: It's the best quality I promise ;)
[2:09:13] Sebleh: You straight up told my boy he was wrong Smadge Nagoogoo stop gaslighting Kuroz stopbeingMean
[2:09:41] rtcinema: The rodecaster does require an XLR mic, but I love mine
[2:09:41] AlexGarlea: VideoMic NTG is for video recording
[2:10:29] Sebleh: NOTED ok I thought the issue was just the software
[2:10:51] Raggu2: just use all of them at once.
[2:11:05] Sebleh: Yeah just use the wireless mics from cooking streams EZ
[2:11:37] Sebleh: Honestly let's just give up on the mic. Get one of those 480p laptop webcams and use the mic on that.
[2:11:40] Kuroz: the shure
[2:11:43] rtcinema: sm7b
[2:11:44] AlexGarlea: Check Rode X Streamer X
[2:11:45] Im_Guu: Shure smb7
[2:11:47] Sebleh: Yes expensive
[2:11:51] AlexGarlea: SM7B it is expensive yea
[2:11:52] Kuroz: more expensive than your mics yes
[2:12:10] Im_Guu: "Expensive" when talking about audio, is not $400 -$500
[2:12:11] rtcinema: You can get the sm7db too if it's cheaper
[2:12:18] AlexGarlea: But you could go for Rode NT1-A without anyproblems for example
[2:12:19] rtcinema: not sure if that's cheaper or more expensive now
[2:12:30] AlexGarlea: Any large diaphragm microphone will work
[2:12:35] Im_Guu: But I get where you are coming from  :( :( :(
[2:12:45] Sebleh: Yeah the one midna has is that same Shure mic along with a $150 pre-amp
[2:12:51] rtcinema: My dream mic set up is the sennheiser mkh50
[2:12:57] martzerarh: influencer naguura, why not ask for a sponsorship and tell them about all the exposure you can give to billy in the post office, and margaret in the supermarket etc?
[2:13:03] AlexGarlea: Actually the SM7B is not that comfortable since it is a cardioid and you have to place it right next to your mouth all the time
[2:13:04] rtcinema: SSM7DB is the newer one
[2:13:08] rtcinema: SM7DB*
[2:13:22] Ignite_CLO: i did the math, the difference is about 100$
[2:13:26] rtcinema: It comes with more gain built in
[2:13:33] rtcinema: which you dont need with the rodecaster
[2:13:44] rtcinema: otherwise it's identical to the sm7b
[2:13:47] AlexGarlea: You can check Rode X streamr X. It is smaller and cheaper, then just plug the XLR microphones into it and see if you really need to buy another microphone
[2:13:57] holly3d: the Sm7db already got the preamp incl.
[2:13:58] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[2:14:08] trollinmyimp: Wait, don't you run this as a business? 400.00 is a lot of money?
[2:14:18] AlexGarlea: Yea
[2:14:22] Kuroz: HUH
[2:14:22] AlexGarlea: Dont spend all money
[2:14:30] ricardo_alvelos: HUH
[2:14:37] Sebleh: KEKW
[2:14:40] Brainraid: Maybe check out the Behringer Flow8?  About 260€ and mixer and multiple inputs
[2:14:46] Jothor83: zilchC zilchC zilchC
[2:14:46] Ignite_CLO: TAX WRITEOFF KEKW
[2:14:51] Sebleh: Cant we get KEKThisGuy on 7tv? PepeLaugh
[2:15:00] trollinmyimp: I mean, come on, it's a full blown business expense...
[2:15:02] skissmann: wym is not pocket money to you? Weirdge
[2:15:05] Sebleh: https://7tv.app/emotes/63fd3d1de5d9925da8126974
[2:15:05] skissmann: 400
[2:15:05] eloveart: Cheer200 i really enjoyed your broadcasting this weekend. thanks for the insight!
[2:15:06] GlacierRays: 400 is still a lot of money
[2:15:09] Burnprof: damn I was to slow with the tax thing
[2:15:11] Pizzakatong: @Naguura send you insta DM for using voicemeeter with EQ VSTs
[2:15:11] AlexGarlea: Yep I agree with @Brainraid Behringer Flow 8 is a good alternative
[2:15:30] TotallyNotRaien: arent all businesses made of money and can afford everything?
[2:15:36] Sebleh: Excuse me you've never heard anything dumber? Am I not here every day? HUH
[2:15:38] AlexGarlea: Also @Naguura you can find B-STOCK items on thomann which are returned from customers, full guarantee and the look like new.

[2:15:40] Rastishkinstein: KEKthisguy
[2:15:49] Pnda1103: so valid
[2:16:00] SenorTostada: Business = Money printer right?
[2:16:12] trollinmyimp: I mean if we were talking 10k, but seriously, 400.00 is a problem for a business expense?
[2:16:12] rtcinema: People conditioned reading about startups spending millions and producing nothing
[2:16:16] Burnprof: I bet the mic in her helicopter is more expensive...
[2:16:24] Pnda1103: business is just free money.the credit card you dont have to pay back
[2:16:26] GlacierRays: I bought the GoXLR Mini 4 years ago for £140. The rodecaster Duo that has very similar functionality is £450 now. That's a very expensive product for what it does
[2:16:28] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:16:32] rrasmussen: @Naguura what is dreamstate on a boomie, i have watch your youtube clip 3 times and still dont understand it
[2:16:37] Pizzakatong: @GlacierRays sign
[2:16:58] StreamElements: Check out the Warhammer 40,000 special pack for PowerWash Simulator. The DLC is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Steam. https://bit.ly/PWW40k_Naguura #ad
[2:17:00] SenorTostada: Here's a 1.000.000.000 dollar bill!
[2:17:03] Pizzakatong: @GlacierRays but always a "what do you need" scenario
[2:17:03] OdyssaQ: I'll have 20million doubloons, thank you Mr Bank.
[2:17:11] AlexGarlea: TC-Helicon GO XLR Mini is similar to the other ones I told you about. Like Behringer FLOW 8 and the Rode products. Good luck!
[2:17:23] SenorTostada: @OdyssaQ LUL
[2:17:24] Sebleh: tbf that does explain why you can buy a luxury vacation apartment in the mountains of Italy
[2:17:27] Pnda1103: what can a business owner get for a few sheckles
[2:17:30] TotallyNotRaien: thats how shes affording her new apartment, shes commiting business card fraud
[2:17:46] AlexGarlea: I would try the xlr microphone which you already own with one of these interfaces.
[2:17:48] ItsUrBuddyJake: Im here for powerwash simulator.... what game is this?!
[2:17:49] GlacierRays: @pizzakatong oh absolutely. I was just looking at the duo and the dual-usb is a nice touch
[2:18:02] ItsAcorns: Did Myst steal Tobo from Echo?
[2:18:14] Pizzakatong: its a very good mic
[2:18:25] AlexGarlea: Also from Thomann you can easly return if the product doesn't meet your expectations
[2:18:26] Sebleh: How often will you do the IRL streams tho?
[2:18:26] Burnprof: you do IRL streams?
[2:18:26] Kuroz: test it in Prague hmmMeeting
[2:18:43] AlexGarlea: !mic
[2:18:44] StreamElements: Rode Videomic NTG shotgun mic / Beacn mix create - Elgato Wave Mic Arm Low Profile // Kitchen/IRL streams : Rode wireless GO II, Rode NTG2 shotgun mic
[2:18:54] AlexGarlea: I would use RODE WIRELESS GO II without any doubts. for IRL
[2:19:14] AlexGarlea: Then one of the xlr shotgun mics you already own
[2:19:25] Sebleh: I think if you're going to piecemeal this purchase, get the stuff you absolutely will keep first. Like if you're going to absolutely get the mixer, get that first and try it with the shotgun and the elgato mic, then consider swapping the mic.
[2:19:47] Kuroz: do a test in may and then see if it's worth keeping it or not
[2:19:51] Im_Guu: Keep the shotgun mic
[2:19:55] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[2:20:00] Sebleh: Yeah what @Kuroz said tbh
[2:20:08] rrasmussen: @Naguura what is dreamstate on a boomie, i have watch your youtube clip 3 times and still dont understand it
[2:20:12] Burnprof: tell them to bring their own mics
[2:20:24] Sebleh: @rrasmussen Dreamstate is the new 2pc bonus
[2:20:30] Im_Guu: The caster duo
[2:20:36] Im_Guu: supports Rhode USB mics
[2:20:38] ActuallyNate: ActuallyNate subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[2:20:43] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[2:20:43] AlexGarlea: did you say you have a non-working microphone??
[2:20:44] Pizzakatong: you then have to use a preamp for and it works with everything then
[2:20:46] Im_Guu: Compatible with a range of RØDE USB microphones, allowing for an additional mic input
[2:21:04] Sebleh: oh right. well still it sounds like the mixer will be more adaptable to the stuff you already have than getting the new mic first
[2:21:41] AlexGarlea: Keep in mind that any shotgun or large diaphragm microphones require 48V to work. You have that option on the focusrite interface you got there.
[2:21:48] sim967: I’m confused, so I’m just going to keep nodding as if what people are saying makes sense to me
[2:22:37] AlexGarlea: 48V = phantom power..
[2:22:46] Pizzakatong: rodecaster should have this too, for 500 euros
[2:22:50] Pizzakatong: LUL
[2:22:57] AlexGarlea: what is the mic you are using now ? usb or xlr
[2:23:00] rtcinema: Which one do you have?
[2:23:19] AlexGarlea: yea you can use it with the rodecaster
[2:23:23] AlexGarlea: they are compatible
[2:23:25] rtcinema: I have a rodecaster and videomic ntg I can test together

[2:58:47] Sarcissa: Google says alpine touring
[2:58:53] throwmasterlol: top touring or something
[2:59:01] Coffeeguru: Sherpa
[2:59:17] Sarcissa: Alpine is the english word for snowy hills/mountains basically
[2:59:19] JohnnyOneLung: why did people say that was wrong lol? that seems to fit perfectly
[2:59:21] Sarcissa: I guess
[2:59:26] bumpledore: alpine touring is just a kind of skis and bindings
[2:59:32] Kuroz: cause it's twitch chat
[2:59:38] Kuroz: CatDriving
[2:59:40] bumpledore: its just Ski touring
[3:00:02] Sebleh: It’s wrong because the streamer said it and twitch chat is not allowed to agree with the streamer.
[3:00:07] Sebleh: it’s in the twitch TOS
[3:00:25] Coffeeguru: Well, all words are made up though
[3:00:27] JohnnyOneLung: ngl a few times twitch chat have annoyed me with that LUL

[3:02:48] SenorTostada: @seeker287 100% one of the best
[3:03:03] throwmasterlol: can do masters whenever, but only play release once

[3:08:03] nevernude1: I think that is true of any interactions with strangers online or offline
[3:08:07] everjaz: i always live by that one quote "Never attribute to malice that which can be explained by ignorance" (maybe not on twitch LOL)
[3:08:09] yooyoo1337: I never lie :)
[3:08:44] Im_Guu: @Kahlandra Can relate to that :D except  the high tolerance part, 17 years of technical support for a custom electronics and solutions business killed it.
[3:08:51] Sebleh: twitch chat is never wrong
[3:08:56] Sebleh: chat would never lie

[3:11:24] Yoshli: Mi no hable espagnol
[3:12:12] Sebleh: i will say it was horrible to learn about housing ventilation in South Tyrol because I legitimately wanted to learn and idiots in twitch chat just kept saying “that’s not how you do it you dumb streamer! you do it like my house is done!”
[3:12:39] Burnprof: so sad that there is no trustworthy spanish speaking person in chat

[3:17:26] JohnnyOneLung: they review popular products or services that influencers are pushing and warn you if it's shit or not
[3:17:28] Yoshli: What's a defluencer
[3:17:39] Yoshli: lol that's nice
[3:17:47] Raggu2: they basically bad mouth products with a "trust me bro"
[3:17:47] everjaz: i am an anti-consumer so i love it lol
[3:17:56] Stricken79: twitter does YEP added context NODDERS
[3:18:07] GONEBYSPRING: SHe got a point actually 🤔 fucking big brain

[3:20:05] murksi: its asmons business model
[3:20:08] Raggu2: The real problem is taking a single sources statement or opinion as fact.
[3:20:09] valemonwow: confirmation bias
[3:20:09] Kahlandra: confirmation bias
[3:20:26] Sebleh: the fucking “bad breakup syndrome” viewers are the fucking worst.
[3:21:02] Sebleh: a handful of streamers having thousands of whiny bitches “wow bad Smadge ” fueling the rage bait opinions
[3:21:05] murksi: 100%
[3:21:14] Yoshli: In workplaces we can also see that poeple like to be negative because being negative is far easier
[3:21:36] Yoshli: and it makes it easier to get your way, it's easier to find other people who will join the bandwagon instead of just being happy
[3:21:41] scassel85: Can't wait to see this later on YouTube with Asmon reacting to it LUL
[3:21:56] Xendera5: I don’t know why people view asmon

[3:22:24] reifebiggiausdetmold: do you eat snickers?
[3:22:28] Raggu2: negative opinions on negative opinion
[3:22:32] Sebleh: i had a very brief stint watching bellular’s videos which went from interesting lore deep dives to 10 minute speculation video about one sentence presented as facts (and wrong) and then rage bait and fake outrage from speculation classic
[3:23:08] Raggu2: So whats this title mean. Are you power washing warhammer soldiers?
[3:23:14] TheoTheFriendlyGreek: Morning chat morning Caro how are we today
[3:23:22] Sebleh: it seems like the natural progression of any big game is to feed of the controversy of hating on it.
