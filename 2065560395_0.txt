[0:03:12] Badasti: like you start shooting and there's 100ms or so between shot sounds
[0:03:47] Badasti: i love the apple ear buds, i cant wear other types
[0:04:10] Badasti: @killervitamin i didnt measure the delay but ive owned 2 sets, therei is a noticeable delay
[0:04:16] Mckriminal: @venruki  do you expect dh get to nerfed for s4?
[0:04:29] Reiumi_: KEKW
[0:04:34] LordRatigan: Kappa
[0:04:39] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man
[0:05:26] Zeniticon: only need spark and the arena token
[0:06:16] Badasti: @killervitamin Actually after a quick google search, some people tested and got between 200 and 300ms delay, so I guess you are right, they dont have 100ms delay LUL
[0:06:23] P1otTw1st: Wait Nikthevoker, aren‚Äôt you the dev that rages every single shuffle lobby? ü´†
[0:06:45] P1otTw1st: EVERY SINGLE ONE LOLLLL
[0:07:09] NurfMe206: You can describe another recent meal you made, i enjoy that content
[0:07:18] nikthevoker: i had 3 lobbys last night, 4 people afk
[0:07:40] nikthevoker: almost, not all
[0:07:40] NurfMe206: what was the cut of the steak
[0:08:12] NurfMe206: damn yummie sounding meal, the egg part surprises me
[0:08:15] NurfMe206: ah the old asmongold special
[0:08:27] NurfMe206: Just for dinner tho, but sounds delicoous
[0:08:48] NurfMe206: thats true, im asian, and can confirm
[0:09:16] P1otTw1st: Hey Ven I‚Äôm curious what your current thoughts are on what would be a good next step for incentivizing healing

[0:10:08] flames222: make healing great again
[0:10:18] Zeniticon: i think its not restricted to a realm
[0:10:23] Badasti: someone save this man from the trade gauntlet
[0:10:24] Zeniticon: anyone can recraft
[0:10:25] Izzythediscpriest: good morning
[0:10:36] MarioTF2: recraft is realm only
[0:11:18] MarioTF2: just make a new one and tip like 300g
[0:11:21] Izzythediscpriest: @MarioTF2 is it really?
[0:11:21] MarioTF2: some noob will make it
[0:11:24] P1otTw1st: would there be a major downside to creating a system for gold income for healing shuffle, I feel like the upsides would significantly outweigh any potential downsides
[0:11:56] Vigi9413: the problem with crafts is someone crafted mine but not to 463
[0:12:28] nikthevoker: like WOD
[0:12:33] joemt0: I buy like a token a week
[0:12:41] hooqs: gold for healing shuffles u end up with omega bots just farming gold
[0:12:59] Badasti: @killervitamin dude read up on it. I had air pods which is why I looked into it. I also make my livelihood on technology so you're barking up the wrong tree. I'm talking about bluetooth specifically on apple codecs
[0:13:30] dmicrl: Everyone is just sick of getting they're damage tripled by DH
[0:13:46] Roxxybolts: we got a new mouse we are primeddddddd
[0:14:10] P1otTw1st: I main healer so I‚Äôm not affected by queue times but there has to be something to make people want to try healer and consistently play healer. it‚Äôs gonna be hard to ‚Äúmake healing more fun‚Äù in the current state of pvp cuz it‚Äôs just naturally so much more fun to do big dam
[0:14:37] joemt0: I just wanna watch awc
[0:14:40] Izzythediscpriest: just had a lobby were it was not fun lol
[0:14:50] fearsii: i enjoy healing until a DH rides my ass
[0:14:51] dmicrl: Played Holy Priest for the first time in 2 seasons and surprisingly enjoyed
[0:14:51] strafekey: healing is fun.. they need to fix the MMR if they want more participation
[0:14:52] flames222: i like healing in actual 3s and 2s but solo shuffle is a nightmare
[0:14:58] Badasti: @killervitamin apple products arent 'gaming products' - jeez dude whatever man, you go get some if you want and let me know how great they perform. I'm not getting paid to change your mind so I don't care LUL
[0:15:21] joemt0: AirPods are BiS
[0:15:40] azliaris1: is team liquid the actual liquid guild?
[0:15:48] ItsBees: New belt Pog
[0:16:13] Taevenx: Mourn
[0:16:15] Badasti: if you dont notice a delay in FPS games then I don't know what to tell you, just google it if you don't believe me, anyway im bowing out of this discussion
[0:16:20] ovidiucristian: ovidiucristian subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! happy anniversary
[0:16:33] xDroozyy: rukiBuddy
[0:16:34] lordwizardmonk: its because Jelly is jealous of liquid
[0:16:46] nikthevoker: tanked down to 2.4 getting troll ass lobbys LUL
[0:16:51] azliaris1: good to see a stream thats not Scarlet mon for 5 hours in a row
[0:16:52] Vigi9413: now i remember why i don't sit in trade chat
[0:17:42] Vigi9413: what's the point of going fist weapon in OH
[0:17:52] nightmxz: Are DHs playing 47% vers?
[0:17:58] despised1: @venruki For healer how do you tell if he is fistweaving vs other heal spec?
[0:18:27] Xeliumimar: dh abomination of a spec
[0:18:36] P1otTw1st: if they use faeline stomp @despised
[0:18:44] xDroozyy: i open up 3's lfg and all i see is DH/DK lf heals LUL
[0:18:51] bigdam2024: @despised1 he'll be up your ass
[0:19:10] nightmxz: I just figure the only way you can die is in stuns so 24% passive damage reduction would be good, but fair they're already not dying LUL
[0:19:23] xDroozyy: dk stonks are UP  UP UP
[0:20:01] kyaii: haha no one going to use an isight for 500g so you'll have to hope it's procs max level
[0:20:31] NolaDoja: Vengeance doesn't die lol
[0:20:33] mikeymazz_tv: you get kidney dueled no trinket your dead
[0:20:34] xDroozyy: stats seem to say yes

[0:21:23] srharpster: lol
[0:21:25] caroltheman1: how do you rank affy
[0:21:29] xDroozyy: wow needs more glass cannon specs and not tank dps
[0:21:31] Taevenx: It's always acceptable to nerf ret
[0:21:39] Ailith21: idc that dh is good rn i'm just sick of there being 1-2 of them in every shuffle lobby let me play into something else ffs
[0:21:48] caroltheman1: why am I better at affliction than destro lol
[0:21:52] skytz0: rukiBuddy
[0:22:10] crip9000: when is the next expansion?
[0:22:16] ovidiucristian: aff is more like S+++ in 2s
[0:22:31] Badasti: Affliction is crazy in 2's
[0:22:41] P1otTw1st: hot take: consistently leaving shuffles should be bannable
[0:22:43] Badasti: at least up to 2k mmr
[0:22:48] xDroozyy: a good aff in 2's is s+++, a new aff is F
[0:22:57] jxygodx: affliction is awful in 2s lol
[0:23:09] Xeliumimar: wow aff so crazy LOL
[0:23:18] emergencxyz: damn way more warriors and rogues than dh
[0:23:36] fazedoritoss: Affliction loses to better players 100%
[0:23:39] shameshady: are you going to watch any MDI this weekend @venruki, or not your thing?

[0:23:46] soddi: affliction are good at giving me a 0:6 if my enemy heal is a monk
[0:23:52] ledpredatorx: wtb mog trainer kek
[0:23:58] fazedoritoss: afffliction is not terrible in 3s tho
[0:24:01] Badasti: hey I didn't call it "s++++" but I did play it with my friend at 2k mmr and we felt immortal
[0:24:14] emergencxyz: It blows my mind that MDI gets the viewers that it does compared to AWC
[0:24:15] despised1: I think rogue is twice as strong as dh.  They can cc the whole team and 100-0 in 3 seconds
[0:24:28] Ailith21: feels like most specs in shuffle are pretty middling rn which is nice
[0:24:48] caroltheman1: not wrond took me 2 hours to get 1850 as destro without touching it ever lol
[0:24:54] xDroozyy: aff in 3's is like pineapple on pizza, sure some people like it but prob better w/ other toppings
[0:25:10] jxygodx: demo/affy is actually gross
[0:25:10] busfulla: Hey man. Any advice on a pve class between feral or rogue? Like the playstyle of them both. I'd like to dabble in PvP but blizzard forces me to pve to get my pvp stuffs no?
[0:25:12] Badasti: the main thing I found was we oom'd their healer really fast
[0:25:19] Badasti: there's not much kill pressuer in 2's with healer dps
[0:25:23] Sosatko: Had some roguh 3s ques last night
[0:25:25] Symo85: hello sir
[0:25:29] What_ln_Tarnation: why is your troll body type 2 dh bald?
[0:25:30] Badasti: so he'd just rot them oom every game
[0:25:37] Sosatko: Just DH/Rogue world
[0:25:50] Reiumi_: monkaW
[0:25:50] What_ln_Tarnation: 2cute
[0:25:52] goatjo___: his true demon form
[0:25:52] caroltheman1: seductive
[0:25:53] soddi: much better
[0:25:57] goatjo___: demon king form
[0:25:57] dolanknoob: Good to see everyone playing DH as a protest until it gets gutted
[0:25:58] Garthd: Femruki
[0:26:05] koydras: Is Mage still the best 2s partner with a sub rogue? Trying to get my buddy back to the game
[0:26:10] ItsBees: I do
[0:26:13] dolanknoob: I def do.
[0:26:14] azliaris1: yes we do
[0:26:16] Reiumi_: buff dh
[0:26:17] azliaris1: fuck em
[0:26:17] epicalec333: when does the new season start?
[0:26:19] emergencxyz: Buff dh
[0:26:25] xDroozyy: do tell
[0:26:32] dolanknoob: DH has been insane since DF. I want it in the trash can for a wee bit.
[0:26:34] bigslawomir1: "body type 2 is wild
[0:26:37] emergencxyz: Tel is speaking facts
[0:26:38] fazedoritoss: Dh was fine before the stam change now they are immortal
[0:26:47] Taevenx: Death Sweep hitting for 200k+ is kinda wack
[0:26:59] Reiumi_: right the warriors
[0:27:23] ItsBees: Boomys Sadge
[0:27:27] dolanknoob: LMAO
[0:27:29] dolanknoob: UNREAL
[0:27:35] dolanknoob: GUT IT
[0:27:41] Fixit_cat: Seems accurate lol
[0:27:42] dolanknoob: NUKE FROM ORBIT
[0:27:43] Paveru_Hakase: "they die in stuns" - COPIUM
[0:27:47] emergencxyz: @dolanknoob Nope its balanced
[0:27:50] emergencxyz: R1 dh
[0:27:54] Wretchedd: yeah just bring back mage rogue meta, so riveting
[0:28:02] chancywilson: Tel is uuuubbbeerrr tox
[0:28:09] bigslawomir1: has dh been good the whole season?
[0:28:10] What_ln_Tarnation: KEKW
[0:28:14] ItsBees: LUL
[0:28:14] azliaris1: ????????????
[0:28:20] azliaris1: they have every single dr
[0:28:24] Badasti: Do demon hunters play any real classes?
[0:28:25] fazedoritoss: Dh has so much cc
[0:28:33] fazedoritoss: And its all instant
[0:28:36] azliaris1: chaos nova is 5 second
[0:28:43] stealthwalker99: It‚Äôs bait to hit a dh I will hit any healer before them if possible
[0:28:46] lordwizardmonk: I think it would be perfectly acceptable if they just made dhs aloooot easier to kill. leave the damage the same, change their tankiness. boom fixed
[0:28:48] Badasti: I swear these DH players have never played  another class and have no idea what it's like
[0:28:53] What_ln_Tarnation: CD on it DOESNT raise anymore
[0:28:54] soddi: maybe netherwalk should be dispellable by mass dispel like bubble
[0:28:59] chancywilson: lol
[0:29:00] xDroozyy: thats a good cope hit
[0:29:00] nightmxz: micro cc is the best form of cc atm
[0:29:19] Paveru_Hakase: demo lock stun?
[0:29:21] chancywilson: NOT TO MENTIONED CC A DH IS HARD CUZ GLIMPSE AND THAT JUMP
[0:29:23] Holymurdy: storm bolt is also 20yds
[0:29:26] Taevenx: war CC is 20?
[0:29:38] Holymurdy: but travel distance obviously...
[0:29:54] Taevenx: @Holymurdy commented the same time, yeeee
[0:29:57] lordwizardmonk: mvq plays with a cheater what do you expect
[0:30:15] flames222: warriors are just beyblades atm, the least fun build ive played
[0:30:18] What_ln_Tarnation: mvq HAS to simp for dh, ive played with his rogue and hes like 1400 skilled on it
[0:30:19] Paveru_Hakase: @lordwizardmonk monkaHmm
[0:30:21] fearsii: yall wanna beat DH in solo shuffle? just root them healers dont dispell
[0:30:23] absterge: venruki!!!!
[0:30:24] xDroozyy: glad to see frost DK holding bottom line. our time to shine will come
[0:30:29] absterge: have you joined the demon hunter army
[0:30:36] Fixit_cat: stergeSups dewThug ruki1D
[0:30:37] mikeymazz_tv: blizzard doesn't know how to balance, dh is one more nerf away from getting ruined
[0:30:42] zachgamegodx: @lordwizardmonk I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre allowed to post that
[0:30:43] bigslawomir1: have dh been good the whole season or did it just get good recently?
[0:30:50] epicalec333: disgusting lol
[0:30:56] VetisBR: i dont think double dh will work. ccs are trash
[0:31:06] lordwizardmonk: its just my opinion, cancel me if you want idc
[0:31:22] fazedoritoss: Eww just lmk when ur qin buddy imm tryin to dodge
[0:31:27] NovaKosova: @absterge when some fistweaver action?
[0:31:34] chancywilson: Also its a meta on doing dam not cc chains
[0:31:35] Moobot: Latest video "UPDATED 10.2.5 PvP Tier List! EVERY SPEC RANKED!" view it here: youtu.be/E2wCZf3wKiM
[0:31:38] chancywilson: and CC'ing a dh is hard af
[0:31:41] Spaceberry_McDuck: i played with a mage the other day that had 6k rounds played
[0:32:21] absterge: if you lose on DH it‚Äôs not ur fault, ur team just sucks
[0:32:25] absterge: words of wisdom
[0:32:28] dewwy_o: ^
[0:32:30] Reiumi_: true
[0:32:45] xDroozyy: notice how ven not taking any dmg lmao
[0:32:59] emergencxyz: @xDroozyy yeah they arent targetting him duh
[0:33:00] lordwizardmonk: remove all passive tankiness and dhs are fine tbh
[0:33:06] Taevenx: see, DH dam isn't even good
[0:33:17] xDroozyy: blizz gonna see this 6-0 and hotfix insta
[0:33:48] dolanknoob: It's soulscar dot man.
[0:33:50] emergencxyz: dh shit
[0:33:51] dolanknoob: 2nd highest sustain dmg
[0:33:58] dolanknoob: next to afflock
[0:34:02] Spaceberry_McDuck: that boomkin had like permanent precog, lol
[0:34:07] mikeymazz_tv: im pretty sure we should be focusing on destro lock the immortal
[0:34:07] emergencxyz: pad dmg from tierset
[0:34:09] cipusanx: dh need more dmg to prevent team mates from dyeing
[0:34:12] What_ln_Tarnation: dh lost a SS round, that confirms they need buffs
[0:34:16] zachgamegodx: use vengeful retreat times like a meld
[0:34:24] zachgamegodx: to avoid getting cloned
[0:34:27] absterge: DH is like s1 ret post 20 nerfs after the rework
[0:34:28] nightmxz: yeah it was the monk ;)
[0:34:30] absterge: this is hilarious to see
[0:34:44] absterge: we need to rework more classes
[0:34:52] absterge: ret, rogue, DH
[0:34:55] absterge: when‚Äôs the hunter rework
[0:34:56] nikthevoker: and if you say anything, like pls just save kick if youre not sure, youre just toxic LUL
[0:35:00] What_ln_Tarnation: is that monk the actual bruce lee playing it??? Pog
[0:35:07] soddi: nice how the boomie stands just barely outside of his shaman earten
[0:35:08] Reiumi_: Lets go Lilli! Pog
[0:35:08] emergencxyz: @absterge Realz is just the goat of clase design
[0:35:11] emergencxyz: cant blame it
[0:35:27] What_ln_Tarnation: monks need rework
[0:35:28] azliaris1: rework mm hunter next Kappa
[0:35:29] absterge: we need a wwmonk rework
[0:35:37] emergencxyz: Realz just needs to get paid quadruple overtime and design every class
[0:35:38] Zeniticon: they should move 50% of frostmages damage into frostbolt
[0:35:44] nightmxz: @absterge Can't wait for the ret rework coming in 10.2.7 Kreygasm
[0:35:46] Taevenx: they have to have teams/care to rework classes
[0:35:47] weevinx: why rework ww?
[0:35:54] lordwizardmonk: nah leave ww alone, its fine
[0:35:57] What_ln_Tarnation: its so funny how WW rsk actually hits harder than their ToD now in PVE
[0:36:02] nightmxz: bring back fists stun for ww :)
[0:36:08] Badasti: @nightmxz are they actually reworking ret again?
[0:36:18] mikeymazz_tv: who's more tanky, dh or outlaw rogue...hmm
[0:36:28] zachgamegodx: ww need dmg nerf
[0:36:36] lordwizardmonk: @zachgamegodx nope
[0:36:37] nightmxz: @Badasti nah I'm trolling but also maybe they will lmaooo
[0:36:40] What_ln_Tarnation: @mikeymazz_tv dh is more tanky, outlaw has better cds to survive/escape
[0:36:42] Taevenx: just give everyone a damage buff and make S4 a banger
[0:36:45] fistweaveurnan: @zachgamegodx Not really its predictable damage
[0:36:56] aragarde: survival pumps
[0:37:03] Holymurdy: @mikeymazz_tv Ven just showed graphs he posted on X that show dhs die less than outlaw
[0:37:08] aragarde: been seeing them 100k explosive bombs
[0:37:12] Badasti: @nightmxz remember when they 'reworked' mages by changing like 2 talents or some shit LUL   that was great
[0:37:12] zachgamegodx: if they get better cc and anti cc
[0:37:13] absterge: monk rework = RSK is free of cost, blackout kick can reset RSK CD, tiger palm applies disable and reduces your targets damage and healing by 5%
[0:37:13] What_ln_Tarnation: damage is ALL wws have atm, their utility is trash
[0:37:23] xDroozyy: frost DK
[0:37:23] zachgamegodx: they would need nerf dmg
[0:37:27] slimthicknasty9999: are you gunna play 3s with supa
[0:37:32] RNJudas: outlaw also requires 100% of your brain while dh is braindead
[0:37:49] nightmxz: They really should give ww monks marked for death
[0:37:59] emergencxyz: @RNJudas I think best way to describe it is skill floor for dh is way lower than other classes
[0:38:06] zachgamegodx: @rnjudas doesn‚Äôt take much brain power to step kidney a healer blade rush back in on cd
[0:38:07] emergencxyz: but skill ceiling is about even with most melee
[0:38:12] What_ln_Tarnation: @absterge i want to see a hit combo system in WW rotation like in fighting games, would be coo
[0:38:31] aragarde: yes play with supa
[0:38:38] seymorebuckets: Nothing like waiting 30 min for a shuffle queue then having to use the bathroom and coming back to no queue :(
[0:38:40] Reddbull2345: BOOMY is just taking it

[0:38:51] americanmoses18: supasmorc
[0:39:00] Bonegraft: i want fists of fury to aoe stun again
[0:39:09] americanmoses18: hai @absterge
[0:39:20] dolanknoob: nerf soulscar substantially, make essence break 1 min cd, remove aoe MS from blade dance and only main targ, blur to 1:30, and delete immo dispel entirely so roots actually mean something.
[0:39:39] absterge: fist of fury has 20 yard range, RSK now grips your target and is free of cost.
[0:39:41] zachgamegodx: @dolanknoob nah
[0:39:45] zachgamegodx: fuck roots
[0:39:51] Gizzlefsb: When can we expect balancing for retail? Considering quitting if i keep getting double and triple dh lobbies have 3 hpallies couple points from r1 ss range but i dont wanna q them until changes.
[0:39:58] Badasti: i just dont see why alter and block are dispellable but blur and netherwalk arent. Esp when they still have glympse, dark and leech
[0:40:04] absterge: we need wwmonks to RSK us from 20 yards away and grip us into the fight
[0:40:07] americanmoses18: rsk procs off all abilities and fof makes you immune to all damage
[0:40:08] zachgamegodx: I want roots to mean less
[0:40:08] nightmxz: Tiger's palm now has 30 yd range and still charges you to your target
[0:40:18] aragarde: dolan thats more then a nerf right there...
[0:40:24] stealthwalker99: The fist dodge and slow is toxic in my opinion. I want the dodge removed
[0:40:27] Tbkingdraco: because ones magic the other isn‚Äôt lol
[0:40:43] americanmoses18: karma instantly kills the target its used on
[0:41:09] mikeymazz_tv: imo don't nerf any class, just buff the other ones
[0:42:09] azliaris1: blur is also omnidirectional dodge and bugged at 80%
[0:42:13] aragarde: supa threes
[0:42:20] Taevenx: buff DH
[0:42:26] mrluke46: hi ven i got a question can you tell me what totems are worth to kill as dh
[0:42:39] Xeliumimar: you dont like sweating early and often?
[0:42:42] Badasti: @azliaris1 dodge has always been from all directions afaik, its only parry that requires you to face the target
[0:42:42] xqooq: wsapppppppppp
[0:42:59] zachgamegodx: so true
[0:43:00] Reiumi_: YEP
[0:43:16] Cvarks: hows ur week going
[0:43:25] azliaris1: no
[0:43:29] Badasti: dodge has always worked from behind
[0:43:30] azliaris1: its supposed to be regular dodge
[0:43:31] dangen86: its always been like that
[0:43:33] Badasti: since vanilla afaik
[0:43:46] Badasti: parry requires that you face the target
[0:43:47] TootinFresh: Committed any felonious crimes lately?
[0:43:53] azliaris1: @Badasti you cant dodge from the back my dude
[0:43:55] shatmurloc: but rouges evasion doesnt work from behind?
[0:44:03] dangen86: @Badasti nope, only DH blur does
[0:44:33] kickflipy: what is this song :O
[0:44:36] Badasti: @azliaris1 https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dodge you're right actually im thinking of PVE, mobs can dodge from behind
[0:44:38] soddi: dh is blind anyway, no sight needed to dodge an attack
[0:44:46] Badasti: players cant
[0:44:50] NozakGaming: Ven i played FW for the first time yesterday and went 10-1 in 2v2 at 1700 mmr. which i know isnt crazy but 1900 is my highest rating.
[0:44:57] NozakGaming: its soo broken
[0:44:58] absterge: fist of fury now stuns your target for 4 seconds, reapplied every second if not stunned. RSK grips your target and is free of cost. Tiger palm charges to your target and causes them to take 5% increased damage from all sources for 6 seconds.
[0:45:02] absterge: lets go monk rework!!!
[0:45:10] Bigvuqoffdam: fistweaver is great!
[0:45:23] absterge: I don‚Äôt remember that
[0:45:23] Reiumi_: omg sparring
[0:45:24] Reiumi_: LOL
[0:45:25] azliaris1: 15% parry
[0:45:27] Reiumi_: yes
[0:45:28] absterge: what was sparring
[0:45:30] aragarde: they should bring back that flower shooting ability for ww
[0:45:35] aragarde: i can't remember what its called
[0:45:36] Reiumi_: EZ
[0:45:39] absterge: HAHAHAHAHAA
[0:45:46] Taevenx: great PvP talent
[0:45:50] Reiumi_: hell yeah it was
[0:45:54] Ericx: Make incap double duration from behind again
[0:45:58] TootinFresh: Are there pvp changes coming?
[0:46:04] nightmxz: I'm down to revert ww and arcane mage to legion versions :)
[0:46:05] soddi: sounds like a recipe to randomly parry stuns
[0:46:07] shameshady: didnt monk have a massive dmg reduction in stun in mop ?
[0:46:08] slimthicknasty9999: get supa in here
[0:46:11] shameshady: they should bring that back
[0:46:11] What_ln_Tarnation: member when fof stunned? what if they add the stun to sotwl now since its longer cd?
[0:46:18] absterge: guys fistweavers r making a comeback to the meta after being oppressed because of ret haters in s1
[0:46:21] dolanknoob: I think if DH gets hit hard with nerfs we can see many other specs flourish again. I want assa rog to be viable again.
[0:46:21] Badasti: i liked different mechanics like this back in the day - I guess it goes back to what you were talking about with Jelly about rock paper scissors vs what we have now
[0:46:38] absterge: any prime subs
[0:46:39] despised1: @venruki WHen will they nerf rogue?   any talk about that?  All 3 specs are disgustingly broken
[0:46:49] despised1: They are impossible to kill
[0:46:55] dolanknoob: Assa sucks.
[0:47:02] Badasti: the reason I've always been a hater for demon hunters is just that so many of their abilities do too much for a single global
[0:47:09] Sosatko: I had a sub rogue 100-0 my 3s partner thro full hots + ironbark
[0:47:15] Sosatko: ina duel so much skill xd
[0:47:17] fistweaveurnan: @Sosatko I bet
[0:47:19] What_ln_Tarnation: @dolanknoob assa sucks compared to other 2 specs but it still pumps
[0:47:38] Badasti: it moves them, and it damages someone, or it moves them and it immunes cc, or it does aoe dam and it dispells, or its an ice block but they can move around super fast blablabla
[0:47:39] RNJudas: the complexity of DH just doesnt line up with the damage you can do. meanwhile other specs have to do algebra just to be competitive.
[0:47:42] aragarde: i mean i see lots of bad dhs lol
[0:47:55] emergencxyz: Skill floor on dh is way lower but skill ceiling is about even with other melee like war ret dk monk etc
[0:48:00] RNJudas: @aragarde but they'd be even worse on other classes
[0:48:05] MagickWarlock: do you think it's an intentional move by blizzard to create more user friendly specs for newer or casual players?
[0:48:06] tangell0s: I watched Absterge playing 3s last night and they lost to a DH sequencing terribly but it's a DH so it didn't matter. like went Blade dance into Essence Break for the kill
[0:48:30] Badasti: @emergencxyz I don't think that's true
[0:48:35] 4Liqur: i have a friend who is brain dead hardstuck 1800 every season, he is pushing 2600 in solo and 2300 in 3s on his DH and talking about making a team...
[0:48:36] 4Liqur: LOL
[0:48:45] aragarde: I personallly prefer dh before changes, that demon was a nice heal and i wasn't top of the meters, the changes to the dps rotations made them do too much in exchange for what it lost
[0:48:47] aragarde: so i get that
[0:49:15] soddi: i had a dh yesterday in shuffle that only attacked if you stood near him, and if you ran to fast away, he turned around and ran back to the same spot in the starting zone
[0:49:29] tangell0s: @soddi so you had a bot
[0:49:33] aragarde: ^ bot
[0:49:37] slimthicknasty9999: invite supatease
[0:49:41] slimthicknasty9999: you‚Äôll win
[0:49:53] Sosatko: I just couldnt believe a sub rogue killed my boy through full hots + ironbark in a duel
[0:49:56] Sosatko: it was so cringe lol
[0:50:06] despised1: @venruki Did you notice any kickbotting and pillar stomp before it was on the screen in the awc?  I see a lot of ppl saying some cheating going on there
[0:50:06] Sosatko: Like what more can I do to outplay the rogue
[0:50:14] soddi: ya, didn't feel like a human, but I would have never thought people let a bot play unsupervised
[0:51:01] aragarde: i want some rhubarb pie
[0:51:16] tangell0s: One-off moments like wizk with the totem I don't think cheating, when it's every time like Jaime's kickboting that's another story
[0:51:20] dolanknoob: rhubarb is awful for your kidneys
[0:51:22] dolanknoob: insane oxalate
[0:51:29] dolanknoob: can legit die if you eat a whole pie
[0:51:59] aragarde: huh, really? well its not like i planned to eat the whole pie in one sitting lmao
[0:52:11] aragarde: and mix it with strawberries of course
[0:52:44] Shinigami797: FW
[0:52:46] truthjuulskill: fistweavers
[0:52:47] Badasti: DH 100%, fistweavers have counters
[0:52:47] Spaceberry_McDuck: DH
[0:52:54] famous1939: fistweavers are beatable
[0:52:56] GadgetCopter: FW because they have the option to play an honest spec
[0:53:07] truthjuulskill: @GadgetCopter exactly lol
[0:53:09] Taevenx: I don't think I've seen something as hated as FW
[0:53:16] Fixit_cat: I hate them, but at least fistweavers help with queue times lol
[0:53:16] Izzythediscpriest: easy to kill a fw with no cocoon no trinket
[0:53:32] Spaceberry_McDuck: @Taevenx i hate FW because iwant to mistweave :(
[0:53:37] Sosatko: @Izzythediscpriest yeah sure lets ignore intervene, bop, spell bop, lay on hands, sac, kekw
[0:53:45] Sosatko: sanc
[0:54:04] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: it‚Äôs crazy to me how no one was talking about fistweavers till the AWC only reason they are now it‚Äôs not like they have had any changes recently, and they aren‚Äôt the best healers very easily countered. just annoying in twos
[0:54:40] Izzythediscpriest: @Sosatko in solo i rarely get help from my team mates but that is under 1900cr
[0:54:40] dolanknoob: @aragarde there are a ton of case reports of people eating too much rhubarh, swiss chard, and spinach
[0:54:43] absterge: @khaoticfeeley false
[0:54:43] dolanknoob: aaaand it killing them
[0:55:00] Voriq: pet classes cluttering the screen my lord
[0:55:06] Sosatko: @Izzythediscpriest SS is diff than coordinated 3s for sure
[0:55:33] tangell0s: Cocoon for 150% of max health at 50% damp
[0:55:35] slimthicknasty9999: where did he find the priest
[0:55:35] zachgamegodx: double kill!
[0:55:37] ButtaTWD: fw needs nuked
[0:55:47] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: @absterge not false lol also don‚Äôt you love fistweavers?
[0:55:48] Izzythediscpriest: @Sosatko i dont really do 3s just solo and 2s and i get crushed by warriors
[0:56:01] absterge: think it‚Äôs easy to dismiss how much utility classes bring and how having a ton of short CDs (1min-90sec) makes it so you can‚Äôt just ‚Äúeasily counter‚Äù
[0:57:44] famous1939: holy is def better, i agree
[0:57:53] famous1939: it pains me playing disc, you just dont have enough juice rn
[0:59:48] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: @absterge I get it. You‚Äôre a fistweaver main so I trust your judgement lol
[1:00:07] absterge: fight 2200 fistweaver teams that are seemingly terminators despite getting hexxed on CD and static/unleashed/rooted/knocked away it‚Äôs a rly rewarding experience. That‚Äôs how the game is tho I suppose. some comps have to do much more, or much less, to win
[1:00:31] GadgetCopter: way of the crane was annoying but way better
[1:00:37] dolanknoob: holy is really good
[1:00:40] dolanknoob: very fun too
[1:00:47] dolanknoob: holyward and fade make it good in shuff
[1:00:50] dolanknoob: hard to get cc'd
[1:01:24] absterge: I told you to play fistweaver last season you hate me
[1:01:47] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: @absterge I think it‚Äôs resto shammy. I feel like priest is just a better healer into FW/Ret but could be wrong.

[1:07:23] Jrexlol: yo
[1:07:58] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: @venruki I agree with most of what you guys are saying. I just think as far as things that are in desperate need of balancing FW isn‚Äôt it. especially since it‚Äôs reliant on a couple comps.
[1:08:10] zachgamegodx: inner demo is phenomenal, usually hits the guy for 100k
[1:08:41] prometheusx47: yo ven in your general tree you should take the point out of immo crit
[1:08:47] prometheusx47: and put into gain fury on purge
[1:08:50] zachgamegodx: are you comparing hits and dmg break down with liquid trill?
[1:08:57] zachgamegodx: theory crafting even
[1:09:03] zachgamegodx: you guys are sportsman
[1:09:12] Holymurdy: @zachgamegodx it's not TRill tho LUL
[1:09:18] Badasti: didnt even know inner demon was a thing lel
[1:09:25] zachgamegodx: it‚Äôs liquid trill
[1:09:32] zachgamegodx: not solid tri
[1:09:35] zachgamegodx: trill
[1:09:35] Voriq: Aura of Pain
[1:09:37] prometheusx47: aura of pain
[1:10:00] Voriq: Swallowed anger is a good choice imo
[1:10:04] Holymurdy: @zachgamegodx it's actually jelly trill, heither liquid NOR solid
[1:10:05] Tragictomb: when did DH stop taking Elysian decree? looks like no one uses it anymore
[1:10:06] Drockzoids: Glad your hair grew back, you looked weird before.  No offense of course
[1:10:06] zachgamegodx: nova

[1:10:30] zachgamegodx: @tragictomb they play cycle of hatred now so they use fel devestation!
[1:10:57] gelatokush: fruitpunch monk
[1:11:07] Tragictomb: oh interesting
[1:11:30] nightmxz: this poor ret warr has to deal with outlaw dh BibleThump
[1:11:46] Voriq: no sympathy for ret warr
[1:11:48] Taevenx: @nightmxz it's a cruel world
[1:12:05] driftwood_tc: DH seems totally fine
[1:12:07] stealthwalker99: that round for you is outlaw-dh-fw seems immortal
[1:12:13] famous1939: not the best time for that rsham to lasso
[1:12:18] Voriq: Essence break into a death sweep is such a good feeling
[1:12:23] zachgamegodx: Cdews team was losing outlaw dh rsham
[1:12:24] Tragictomb: wow no one plays inertia either
[1:12:28] Tragictomb: so much has changed lol
[1:12:30] zachgamegodx: vs ret warr
[1:12:38] famous1939: healer/war
[1:12:43] fearsii: yeah cdew was getting farmed last night by DH/ret killing him
[1:12:46] zachgamegodx: @tragictomb it was nerfed in PvP so they play momentum instead of
[1:13:08] Tragictomb: yeah but after the initial nerf most people still played it‚Ä¶ at least for a bit I thought
[1:13:12] zachgamegodx: ret warr stomps every cleave by default
[1:13:14] Tragictomb: I played it haha
[1:13:28] Tragictomb: oh well good riddance it didn‚Äôt feel good to use
[1:13:32] gelatokush: so if u essence break blade dance then meta blade dance u can fit 2x blade dance in a essence break window pretty sure its the most dam u can do
[1:13:59] Taevenx: @zachgamegodx Cdew, Trill and Mes were beating Ret/War as Outlaw/DH last night Kappa
[1:14:18] driftwood_tc: The gorillaz tunes catJAM
[1:14:33] zachgamegodx: @taevenx unless I was high, it wasn‚Äôt that way when I watched
[1:14:46] zachgamegodx: Kappa
[1:15:12] gelatokush: i think ret war is decent into outlaw dh or am I high
[1:15:18] Bigvuqoffdam: lol
[1:15:23] Taevenx: Shammy saving CDs for next round
[1:15:26] Bigvuqoffdam: y u no dark???

[1:15:51] Bigvuqoffdam: SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[1:16:03] Schwenkyytv: cdew was struggling vs melee cleaves on his sham too
[1:16:41] zachgamegodx: I didn‚Äôt watch full stream but maybe they started owning, either way they‚Äôd never lock a cleave into ret warr team when they have way better comps for it
[1:16:57] Taevenx: ew
[1:16:59] stealthwalker99: fw making healers quit 1 game at a time
[1:17:02] Holymurdy: poor guy :'(
[1:17:03] aragarde: shaman hurting

[1:17:04] KodiakMallets: deadge
[1:17:08] Aimed57: fw needs to be removed from the game
[1:17:11] Aimed57: stupid spec
[1:17:12] Bigvuqoffdam: id leave the shuffle
[1:17:17] bwillyboy: yeah feels like nightmare fuel for the sham
[1:17:26] dyllbarx: GM
[1:17:34] poodzztv: use defensive as while bursting monk so he can‚Äôt heal
[1:17:49] fearsii: rain from above is slept on that does so much damage
[1:18:04] gelatokush: i can attest was healing on my fw yesterday and i had 5 enemy healer leave cuz I was winning on fw NotLikeThis
[1:18:12] zachgamegodx: you lose detain tho @fearsii
[1:18:22] Taevenx: SS do be the "ill use my CDs at 5%" bracket
[1:18:47] fearsii: @zachgamegodx good thing i dont know what detain is lmao
[1:18:52] nikthevoker: its funny "they cant stop cc" counts as raging LUL
[1:18:52] Voriq: dh go swish swish shing shing ded
[1:19:03] aragarde: rain from above can also prevent you from peeling teammate
[1:19:15] cheesemastersam: this kinda proves that dh isnt all its made out to be. ven is a r1 player and isnt 6-0ing these lobbies
[1:19:15] zachgamegodx: @fearsii it‚Äôs a PvP talent that makes incap unbreakable good for peel
[1:19:20] absterge: it‚Äôs kinda funny all the fistweavers stopped playing and said the game was bad, we watch a team in AWC so well as fist and now everyone is back to playing monk
[1:19:22] williwhite94: @venruki how do you find ur music man ?
[1:19:22] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: I think monk was the target there

[1:21:58] freshdots321: I cannot see anymore demon hunter.
[1:22:03] notMase: hmmm what could it be
[1:22:06] What_ln_Tarnation: is it the way your tush looks in that dress?
[1:22:07] aragarde: i thought you wanted to play assassin rogue.. or was that the other day
[1:22:09] Taevenx: shaman should have spammed hex
[1:22:10] freshdots321: too many
[1:22:16] Badasti: i dont know about Ven but I can tell you I used to hate DH, right now I love it. Why struggle my balls off on my mage when I can just vibe out on this class
[1:22:23] absterge: @khaoticfeeley just hate the design, similar to sub. ‚Äúdo the go‚Äù run away
[1:22:25] zachgamegodx: in the spirit of the MDI, ven decided to play DH
[1:22:28] freshdots321: lmfao
[1:22:30] Bigvuqoffdam: PogChamp
[1:22:32] freshdots321: good point
[1:22:58] nikthevoker: @absterge that playstyle so annoying
[1:22:59] Izzythediscpriest: what was the damage done to the fw when the fw was on your team
[1:22:59] freshdots321: I just struggle vs them so i dont like them too much
[1:23:10] Badasti: im never angry playing my dh
[1:23:11] rainmakerwow: @venruki DH's die "in a stun" just like every class out there.... and are easly kited... and and... well... umm ye not sure what i was saying carry on
[1:23:13] Izzythediscpriest: were they focusing the fw
[1:23:18] zachgamegodx: I wish you didn‚Äôt look like that
[1:23:20] freshdots321: lmfaoo
[1:23:21] zachgamegodx: in game
[1:23:24] freshdots321: I wouldnt be either
[1:23:32] What_ln_Tarnation: the most toxic players are dhs tho
[1:23:41] freshdots321: its just not a demon hunter mog

[1:24:14] What_ln_Tarnation: @rainmakerwow they are crusaders of light wym
[1:24:26] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: @absterge a friend of mine mains frost DK he likes it for the burst but I agree the design is pretty flawed. if they don‚Äôt kill you in a 12 second go they are a wet noodle till the next go. funny though when SP had the mind bender build in the beginning of dragonflight they nerfed it immediately it functioned a lot like frost DK now lol
[1:25:18] dolanknoob: @absterge you think hpriest is A tier?
[1:25:38] dolanknoob: i really like playing hpriest.

[1:34:08] Fixit_cat: Left-Face, Right-Face, Roll
[1:34:17] nikthevoker: @venruki i was told theres way to macro glimpse into every ability and just spam to get out of cc LUL like macro glide in
[1:34:17] zachgamegodx: @leeka biggest part of the burst is the last slash of sweep
[1:34:27] dolanknoob: That happens to hpal every shuff
[1:34:31] dolanknoob: once bub is gone, you 100% dead

[1:35:51] Jun_bug__: NERF i cant type
[1:35:59] Vulvayer: just fade the essence and he do 0 damage
[1:36:28] aragarde: it's not like every team in twos is also facing the mmr inflation against people who are better players at times too, though that doesn't disregard dh damage
[1:37:11] zachgamegodx: vens been dispelled of more cc this game than I will in 1 day of solo shuffle
[1:37:15] aragarde: if you win a couple of games they put you in an mmr that substantially puts you against glads or carries
[1:37:28] Vipur45: poly poly poly
[1:37:34] ferahgok: trust me, ferals wish they didn't have to spam cyclone to do damage too lol

[2:59:08] Tinmania: or they really enjoy the casters
[2:59:09] Badasti: I did 2 runs and felt bored to tears so went back to pvp
[2:59:10] dailyshuffle: Honestly, a part of the pvp playerbase is seriously upset about the current PvP meta, especially with no adjustments made to Demon Hunters or Warlocks. Many have chosen to leave the game. The 2v2 format feels entirely redundant with no rewards! i heard from a lot of players they don't wanna login atm, it makes no sense for them to play...

[3:02:35] Badasti: ha
[3:02:47] Ronn_Deezy: i grew up on a cattle farm, it was lame af
[3:03:30] sourbutts: as with everything, its probably both
[3:03:36] Badasti: You ever seen Justified with Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens?

[3:04:23] Ronn_Deezy: we only had 200 head of cattle
[3:04:26] Ronn_Deezy: small town in arkansas
[3:04:36] Ronn_Deezy: but getting up at 4 am to milk cows fuckin sucks
[3:04:44] Ronn_Deezy: if you are the owner and dont have to do shit
[3:04:48] Ronn_Deezy: it prolly owns
[3:04:54] sourbutts: farming is the hardest job in the world.
[3:04:56] blueblrrrd: I live in small town arkansas too...
[3:05:05] zerx_gg: pog i can watch yellowstone on some belgian streaming service
[3:05:09] sourbutts: 100%
[3:05:09] Badasti: damn right
[3:05:13] Spaceberry_McDuck: @Ronn_Deezy child labor sucks, right?
[3:05:17] Badasti: its a major problem in Europe at the moment
[3:05:26] Ronn_Deezy: @Spaceberry_McDuck yeah it was awful, i was in elementary school KEKW
[3:05:45] flapjack1010: amy WA you  could recommend for ele shamn jujst returned to the game after 13 years :D
[3:05:53] flapjack1010: *any
[3:05:57] zerx_gg: whats weird is how long it took for them to make a stand
[3:05:59] sourbutts: here in the UK they are forcing farmers to give up 10% of their land for woodland but are refusing to subsidize the lost land for the farmer, so messed up
[3:06:09] Badasti: its insane, if you hear about the restrictions and stuff they have, they basically make no money farming with really stupid regulations and taxes etc
[3:06:15] sourbutts: bigtime yeah
[3:06:15] Falkhord: easiest class for glad?
[3:06:20] Badasti: yes, germany, france, uk
[3:06:30] skwiglz: i heard it was spreading across europe
[3:06:37] zerx_gg: Belgium, the netherlands..
[3:06:48] sourbutts: just forestland yeah
[3:06:50] PastaSeat: Yea like woods
[3:06:52] zerx_gg: Stores were empty for 2 days
[3:07:04] Tinmania: has something to do with climate control
[3:07:13] sourbutts: imagine being forced to give up 10% of your annual income for 0 reason
[3:07:15] Badasti: farmers already make basically nothing, thought, they are digging into the tiny profits they get. Exports are pricing them out of the market
[3:07:41] PastaSeat: It's so different compared to the US, at least here in CA, where so many farming operations are MASSIVE scale and have huge benefits in terms of like, water and land laws
[3:07:42] flapjack1010: but farmers in Europe get 55 billiiojn Euros yearly from the parlament tp help them
[3:07:51] Bigvuqoffdam: i REALLY enjoy when you play demon hunter
[3:07:56] Bigvuqoffdam: rukiGrin
[3:07:58] Pluckyz: that's what blizz wants
[3:08:00] ATHLTE: LUL
[3:08:03] sourbutts: "you have to give up 10% of your annual profit to make sure theres enough countryside, but we will not pay your for the loss" thats why theres protests.
[3:08:04] skwiglz: thats how i switch from lock to mage in cata
[3:08:05] T1kka: its fun watching strong classes, iunno
[3:08:05] Secretwombatbro: tbh seeing the triple class lobbies
[3:08:09] Secretwombatbro: make me laugh
[3:08:11] Lazeeqt: so basically EU has some rules for farming. you cannot have the same type of plant multiple times in a row on the same field. the reason is because the earth needs time to regain its mineral values so the plant will have the nutritious value it should.  most EU protests were against this rule as they want to make more profits at the expence of the food quality
[3:08:12] Phreshbrew: doesn't matter what you're playing, just like watching you tbh
[3:08:13] Secretwombatbro: like 3dhs and a caster
[3:08:13] Schwenkyytv: why play spriest when there are DHs in the game
[3:08:26] zerx_gg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_farmers%27_protests
[3:08:30] zerx_gg: This explains it
[3:08:46] sourbutts: @Lazeeqt that is not even slightly correct, at least here in the UK
[3:08:47] fistweaveurnan: @Lazeeqt Corn/Soybean farmers in NA swap every year this is standard
[3:08:55] Badasti: pretty sure the farmers also know this, sounds more like propaganda to me
[3:08:55] flapjack1010: but farmers in Europe get 55 billiiojn Euros yearly from the parlament tp help
[3:09:02] Lazeeqt: in EU its 2 years, thats the reason
[3:09:05] Merkflare: yah you rotate crops for minerals
[3:09:08] Lazeeqt: you can google it
[3:09:10] Pluckyz: LOL I thought you were playing DH while just reading chat d'oh!
[3:09:13] mdeckTV: rotating crops is normal. so you dont suck all the minerals from the ground
[3:09:13] Bigvuqoffdam: Ven's been farming the same garbanzos for years and their quality just keeps getting worse
[3:09:17] kand1nsky: farmers in eu getting their subventions cut so they protest
[3:09:18] jporter_: im getting discouraged about no patch notes. DH is so unfun to continue to fight against
[3:09:18] TheBoysCT: my understanding of it is also despite rotating crops it still depletes the topsoil of nutrients, especially adding in chemical fertilizers and "forever" chemicals
[3:09:25] sourbutts: a lot of the money farms make here in the UK is from bailing hay/grass so its purely related to how much land they have
[3:09:50] PastaSeat: @jporter_ Yea it actually kills my interest in the game :/
[3:10:00] oOThugnastyOo: Farming is a science nowadays
[3:10:03] kusoneko: you know what isnt complicated, getting these dubs üÜí
[3:10:04] TheBoysCT: It's primarily the mass scale of farming we have now
[3:10:08] FlyFYI: we shouldnt be tilling the soil it ruins it
[3:10:11] sourbutts: you need a farmer 3 times a day everyday, they are essential to our quality of life, its a really big deal, im from wales and a lot of my friends are farmers
[3:10:12] Secretwombatbro: i want s1 sp back
[3:10:14] leeka: twitter posts dont work
[3:10:16] Secretwombatbro: if dhs get to be like this
[3:10:16] zachgamegodx: shuffle is so much more fun than 3's to interact and drink out coffee's with ven'
[3:10:21] LordRatigan: There is like a full page of dh threads on the wow forums
[3:10:29] zerx_gg: i have 99 farming

[3:10:42] BCboy_: eu has no trees so theres strikes is what im seeing lol
[3:10:54] zerx_gg: wtf is a tree
[3:10:59] FlyFYI: yeah you gotta find a balance of everything. you gotta have bugs that kill the pest or you just have to use chemicals
[3:11:04] jugganautjoe: my dad, grandparents and so on all was into farming, but i have no interest in it...the tradition dies with me and its sad in a way. maybe when im older ill appreciate it more
[3:11:08] memil141: sweden is full of beutiful trees
[3:11:16] driftwood_tc: well EU doesnt really have much "wild" forest area
[3:11:24] Badasti: Estonia, where I used to live had the best air quality in the world IIRC
[3:11:34] Badasti: and its mostly covered in forest land
[3:11:36] lundbergmackan: @driftwood_tc what are you talking about
[3:11:47] LifeOnHardMode: canada is hella forest
[3:11:53] Vulvayer: trees is lame

[3:12:11] blueblrrrd: trees always plottin
[3:12:13] sourbutts: referring to "europe" as a whole is crazy, its like generalising the whole of mexico.canada and the USA together
[3:12:17] kingceejay90: waiting for your queue?
[3:12:18] gritngrind81: not after those wild fires
[3:12:18] LifeOnHardMode: canada also has 20% of the worlds natural fresh water

[3:12:32] fistweaveurnan: @likeewlock He said boreal not rain
[3:12:34] BCboy_: eu lost to trees Kappa
[3:12:35] oOThugnastyOo: When I think trees, I think south america has a ton
[3:12:37] Lazeeqt: russia is 50% forest
[3:12:42] Philand0: google says its russia, brasil then canada
[3:12:53] mdeckTV: oh thats insane. i just always assumed the rainforest was the largest
[3:13:01] driftwood_tc: Looking thicc boi
[3:13:02] memil141: dang
[3:13:12] Badasti: I thought the amazon was the biggest forest
[3:13:13] mfushi: Russia - Brazil - Canada top 3 biggest land mass of forest
[3:13:15] Spaceberry_McDuck: yea,. but do your forests have ents?
[3:13:40] zerx_gg: its lookin like a sixer for the beans
[3:13:41] FlyFYI: @Badasti thats a rainforest
[3:13:43] magestically2: amazon forrst goes through multiple countries

[3:14:18] Merkflare: BOOM
[3:14:20] Slayer_Eagleone: :O
[3:14:22] BCboy_: amazon just way more dense
[3:14:23] magestically2: wow
[3:14:38] Merkflare: the biodiversity is like 50 times more in the amazon though, which is pretty cool
[3:14:38] healhut: forrest flex?
[3:14:40] zerx_gg: i think you're the most dense BCboy_

[3:15:05] Slayer_Eagleone: :D yes you are
[3:15:06] driftwood_tc: Its okay you can forest flex
[3:15:07] thisisthotcaller: how come we never really hear about it in the same context of the amazon? is it better protected or not deforested or something?
[3:15:12] ItsBees: Typical forest smugness Kappa
[3:15:14] LifeOnHardMode: W for boreal forest EZ wins
[3:15:16] sourbutts: a lot of people dont understand the scale of canada
[3:15:22] zerx_gg: man you've got such a huge forrest
[3:15:26] skwiglz: amazon houses more life
[3:15:27] Secretwombatbro: ven out here compared out forests together
[3:15:32] tangell0s: it's cold af up there
[3:15:41] skwiglz: trees in canada half frozen
[3:15:41] Badasti: I think the type of trees that grow in the amazon generate shit tones of oxygen
[3:15:42] Secretwombatbro: wow i cant make sense
[3:15:43] stoutside: grow soy
[3:15:44] Secretwombatbro: oof

[3:16:31] Badasti: i remember playing dune the video game way back in the day
[3:16:38] pragma90: they tried to make dune so dramatic that it was just dumb
[3:16:38] whittier09: Dune was very good..you should watch it
[3:16:42] driftwood_tc: I watched it today, had same thought as you. I loved it.

[4:27:33] Baconeggcheese: except the hunt, the hunt is dope
[4:27:41] Notreallygood: That is what the WoW PvP community has become... just tears about everything. =(
[4:27:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: The range on the hunt is still insane
[4:28:02] figurines: how do people complain abotu other people complaining and not feel like a double bitch?
[4:28:16] figurines: aren't you just x2 the issue?
[4:28:19] beastboyy122: @notreallygood pretty much. DH will get nerf and they will cry about rdruids
[4:28:26] Notreallygood: exactly
[4:28:26] blueblrrrd: if i complain about that am i x3?
[4:28:39] figurines: exactly
[4:28:39] GotUx2times: I dropped my aff lock this season and start playing again DH. now iam at 2340 CR and it‚Äôs feeling good
[4:28:42] Notreallygood: i remember when mace stun would stun the whole team in wrath and the game was still fun
[4:28:50] Notreallygood: off one whirlwind
[4:28:53] Badasti: crazy how those flying rats do the insane damage they do and yet still often arent the kill target
[4:29:29] Badasti: its beautiful
[4:29:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah like half the time people don't even try to kill the DH
[4:30:02] serratedlove: it's hard to kill a dh when they randomly glimpse every stun on accident
[4:30:31] knadam13: LUL
[4:30:36] GoblinRekka: its amazing that every single dh is amazing at the game
[4:30:39] restosoup28: then act like it was on purpose
[4:30:40] xhinoc: no more rage quit from healers ?
[4:30:55] Aiakos21: Venruki is just a god at pvp, it has nothing to do with DH being strong
[4:31:28] khrylx_: @Aiakos21 dh main detected
[4:32:06] Notreallygood: @Aiakos21 I agree, his dmg could be higher but he does all the other things correctly. Positioning, cc and targets are all good. He's just a really good player... and DH is strong for sure.
[4:32:36] aragarde: yea i mean he literally plays every spec and to the best of his ability
[4:32:39] serratedlove: not to mention dh in shuffle have a 21.3% first blood rate lmao lowest of all dps
[4:32:47] Notreallygood: ^^^
[4:33:14] Badasti: @Aiakos21 Ven being good at pvp and demon hunters being broken arent mutually exclusive
[4:33:16] Notreallygood: before buffs they were one of the most popular classes so it makes sense now they are strong lots of people want to pvp
[4:33:23] aragarde: comparing elite glads to casuals is a huge stark difference, not to say there isn't broken classes though

[4:46:45] NAT0_141: ?
[4:46:50] xhinoc: fix your mog ven
[4:46:59] Baconeggcheese: its a windwalker that makes bars go up instead of down
[4:47:16] guesswhofoo: don‚Äôt worry venruki ALWAYS had the best xmogs
[4:47:17] Renethadox: Venruki is one of the few OG pvp players that still contineu to play retail story like vanguards etc, most of them went classic and SoD
[4:47:21] lundbergmackan: wep enchant aswell
[4:47:21] Renethadox: /cry
[4:47:40] Spaceberry_McDuck: no crit
[4:48:03] Baconeggcheese: meeps gems are the crit haste ones but he's prolly got a lot more haste than ur at atm
[4:48:26] Renethadox: are you gonna play some solo que ?
[4:48:41] Renethadox: dude you look like a Doctor man
[4:48:43] Renethadox: hahaha
[4:49:09] Renethadox: yea rea llife doctor, you have a face like a Doc, pediatrist or whatever
[4:49:20] Badasti: paging dr Ven, please heal the patient with your FISTS
[4:49:21] LordZapple: It's the Strong Jaw
[4:49:39] healhut: @badasti LUL
[4:49:46] NAT0_141: I need to peep your YT and see if a new video is out. I‚Äôm between my warrior or monk now that my mage is done
[4:49:56] weenteen1: how come you never got into SOD?
[4:50:09] weenteen1: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve been asked a  million times
[4:50:26] Drockzoids: It gets kind of old
[4:50:35] brolic_9k: retail better
[4:50:42] Renethadox: dude
[4:50:43] weenteen1: oh I‚Äôve never seen you stream it. must have missed it
[4:50:47] brolic_9k: thats why
[4:50:53] Renethadox: tbh SoD is designed for OG players to enjoy their pension
[4:50:56] FateIRL: did you q as dps
[4:51:07] Renethadox: for example Hydra plays SoD, he has nothing to prove anymore cause he did it many tiems in the past
[4:51:11] Enrix_tv: black out kick as well
[4:51:11] ferahgok: faeline priority i think
[4:51:13] Enrix_tv: does big dam
[4:51:15] Enrix_tv: and heal
[4:51:22] timmah25: tiger palm 2x should give max stacks
[4:51:23] mvpala_tv: i think you blackout off cd?
[4:51:27] sanctusirl: Feline activates your healing
[4:51:27] Baconeggcheese: @Renethadox Its kinda funny that some of the people pushing hardest for solo que (savix, stoopzz) don't play anymore now that solo que exists
[4:51:28] Blastr12: palm RSK palm Blackout kick
[4:51:34] mountaholic: max stack rsk blackout kick
[4:51:36] ATHLTE: ^
[4:51:43] NAT0_141: @renethadox retail is for OG players who no longer have the time to grind like we used to lol. retail QoL updates and the speed to experience content is perfect for us
[4:51:49] magestically2: is it still 3x TP for big BOK?
[4:51:56] Blastr12: start a stack
[4:52:00] FateIRL: essence font to proc ancient teaching if u got no jadefire stomp
[4:52:00] Blastr12: of mon
[4:52:04] mountaholic: palm stacks ancient teachings, I think thats the name at elast
[4:52:05] timmah25: allows blackout to hit multiple times and reset rsk
[4:52:05] mountaholic: least
[4:52:22] brolic_9k: @Baconeggcheese ^
[4:52:29] Renethadox: @Baconeggcheese why is savix representing himself as the rank 1 ret paladin btw ?
[4:52:33] Renethadox: Isnt vanguards rank 1 ret ? Oo
[4:52:33] Blastr12: the rotation i have seen effective is palm RSK palm black out kick
[4:52:49] Blastr12: correct
[4:53:11] lordwizardmonk: you dont go haste anyways
[4:53:13] Renethadox: go tear some shiz up Ven!
[4:53:19] Renethadox: your skills can win you this game
[4:53:21] Blastr12: run alpha tiger to help
[4:53:29] ralotheret: oh look a Dh too
[4:53:34] Baconeggcheese: /shrug, I don't watch people play classic its ResidentSleeper
[4:53:35] Badasti: you've got victim no.1, victim no.2 and victim no.3
[4:53:36] Renethadox: tough combo tbh
[4:53:51] ferahgok: @lordwizardmonk you sure about that? more globals-> more damage-> more heals, no?
[4:53:58] ATHLTE: you def go haste
[4:54:00] ATHLTE: as fw
[4:54:06] wreklol: @ferahgok you 100% stack haste as fistweaver
[4:54:25] ferahgok: @wreklol okay that's what I thought lol. lordwizard monk tripping
[4:54:38] Baconeggcheese: I wanted to try and play fw but it feels so bad when you're a ww main. It feels like you're playing the game in slow motion cause of the gcds
[4:54:47] Blastr12: alpha tiger for PvP instead of orbs is going to help you with bad haste
[4:54:49] Slayer_Eagleone: EZ Clap
[4:54:50] sanctusirl: R1 fister
[4:54:55] Slayer_Eagleone: well that was eazy
[4:54:58] FateIRL: ur gonna make this hpally quit

[4:55:16] PeptoAbysmal: HypeLUL
[4:55:17] Blastr12: more healing
[4:55:19] Blastr12: and no roots
[4:55:19] ATHLTE: immune to snares too
[4:55:24] southparkbbb: man i should be playing MW, feel like ive been trolling playing caster monk
[4:55:28] southparkbbb: FW*
[4:55:32] legiontheworgen: and every 3 Blackout Kicks make ur next enveloping instant cast
[4:55:39] Baconeggcheese: big hot, you wanna cast envelopings during it so he breathes on people
[4:55:56] wreklol: gotta love when an hpal stands on top of his dps i guess
[4:56:36] Baconeggcheese: @wreklol  melee wings days
[4:56:39] lordwizardmonk: no fw stacks haste lol
[4:57:18] Badasti: "shuffle queue times so bad chat, roll healers its the moral thing to do, climbing as a healer is hard" *goes fist monk and grinds poor holy paladin into the dirt*
[4:57:26] PeptoAbysmal: i'd be throwing my monitor out the window

[4:58:15] ATHLTE: hahahah
[4:58:29] Baconeggcheese: I rly don't get why people hate fw so much
[4:58:31] ferahgok: you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain. Blizzard did this to us. This is what we have become
[4:58:32] weenteen1: so idk anything about retail. Haven‚Äôt played since cata. does solo queuing arenas with no comms actually work? what if you wanna swap targets?
[4:58:38] JustTaki: pammyhAni
[4:58:45] Renethadox: what is the global cd in dragonflight?
[4:58:47] Renethadox: 0,5 seconds ?

[4:59:19] brolic_9k: @weenteen1 depends on the lobby
[4:59:23] Renethadox: OG mage brother
[4:59:33] Badasti: if i were this paladin my whole evening would be ruined by this point
[4:59:34] TheGRIMDAWG: they think its easy, but people with a brain will cc you :P
[4:59:37] Kikrino: Venruki is a FW main now
[4:59:38] sotirios2000: 6 0 angle?
[4:59:39] TheGRIMDAWG: but its insanely fun to play

[5:02:30] Baconeggcheese: Bro that hpal is about to make a post on reddit
[5:02:42] Badasti: Ven here talking about artichokeys, that paladin is plotting to destroy the world by now. This is how supervillains are created

[5:03:37] RonWilson: @venruki you just started that paladin's villain arc
[5:03:40] TactiTortoise: I played fist weaver for fun the other day after getting really bored with my rsham queues.. Super fun lol
[5:03:43] Baconeggcheese: yeah that couldn't have been a better lobby to start in
[5:03:49] TheGRIMDAWG: whats weird is people dont like FW yet i see barely any of them now, compared to last season atleast
[5:03:58] RonWilson: don't ask "why this is happening" when the paladin is leading the charge to the invasion of canada
[5:03:59] FateIRL: a ranged lobby as fw is rough
[5:04:04] RonWilson: in an attempt to rule the world
[5:04:17] Baconeggcheese: hogwarts is a bad time as a fw
[5:04:23] TactiTortoise: I feel like if you know how to swap between FW and Casted you are set. Playing FW into 4 casters blew ass
[5:04:26] Badasti: i think a decent frost mage does well into fistweavers
[5:04:33] TheGRIMDAWG: there good against dks just smack there pets aha
[5:04:57] Badasti: maybe its just because im in dogshit rank, I just try to slow him out of the deathball and keep him snared

[5:08:39] GreanzyW: When are they nerfing DH? @venruki
[5:09:43] xhinoc: they should stop nerfing and in place buff classes who are dead
[5:10:14] FateIRL: so every class will be as good as dh? hmm
[5:10:24] FateIRL: that would be pretty crazy
[5:10:37] Badasti: most classes arent really a problem, why buff like a dozen specs when they only need to nerf 1
[5:10:40] guesswhofoo: healers arent mentally ready for that
[5:10:40] Ultramagnus85: @xhinoc yea but in casees where one is so ridiculous it needs a nerf it makes more sense to just nerf
[5:11:06] BrewCral: dh almost as bad as ret in s2
[5:11:21] Ultramagnus85: I was healing some shuffle earlier and played against the same healer like 4 times in a row
[5:11:49] TheGRIMDAWG: if you didnt know, essence font also gives you ancient teachings, if jade stomp is on CD :) i tend to pair it with the tea brews occasionally

[5:19:23] TheGRIMDAWG: i run disable on FW when i play it :)
[5:19:29] TactiTortoise: I felt like if I ran the talent that slows people in the fae stomp helped a ton

[5:25:04] Baconeggcheese: I'm experiencing a pattern when I join a random healer in 2s, they die in the opener through every button, and then they go offline
[5:25:20] jag_pvp: crit can feel nice because it double dips on your healing

[5:33:06] waitimdesyncd: yo venruki! that macro video you were in made me scour the web, and it turns out there are legal rotation bots for WoW called lazymacros using a GSE addon for people with disabilities, but it can do some pretty nutty stuff if you edit the scripts since the people that makes all the scripts arent as knowledgeable. But its a huge thing - 1 button everything. Sorry for essaying
[5:33:08] americanmoses18: gg rumsoda KEK

[5:35:59] reavethederp: do mw have the option of tod
[5:36:01] nimbus420i: damm venruki cocooned himself so DH wouldn‚Äôt go 6-0
[5:36:04] Cocoapuffs1: Make a help/ harm macro for touch and cocoon
[5:36:04] Badasti: i try to keep all the same bindings for healer and dps
[5:36:09] FlyFYI: put touch on 5 and your bub on s5
[5:36:13] Myth_The_Wolf: Also, hello Venruki and chat, I got 1800 on my lizard wizard yesterday so I'm starting my anime villain arc and playing Demon Hunter next
[5:36:17] iiEnvy: cuccoon on S-5 and Tod on 5
[5:36:19] Cocoapuffs1: Same bind depending on target
[5:36:23] Pekaus92: make a help harm
[5:36:24] sotirios2000: Rumsoda must feels smart rn
[5:36:33] Cocoapuffs1: I'm on phone or I'd share one
[5:36:38] Badasti: i can make one

[5:36:54] Chillatech: @venruki ow2 is a dps game now
[5:36:56] zachgamegodx: i think
[5:36:57] lordwizardmonk: @venruki heres an idea, do a help harm macro
[5:36:59] Chillatech: dps role is the main sauce
[5:37:07] braziex: /cast [@mouseovert,help,nodead] Cenarion Ward; [@mouseover,harm,nodead] [harm]Skull Bash; Cenarion Ward
[5:37:08] Drockzoids: It's about as hard as #showtooltip /cast [harm] Touch of Death;[help] Cocoon
[5:37:09] Chillatech: ram is really good this patch
[5:37:09] soddi: i mean [nohelp] ^^
[5:37:10] Chillatech: FOR SURE
[5:37:14] ferahgok: I have a help/harm macro for penance ;)
[5:37:22] Chillatech: sig?
[5:37:23] Chillatech: yup
[5:37:25] Chillatech: those are top 2
[5:37:26] braziex: just replace cen ward with cocoon and skull bash with touch
[5:37:36] Myth_The_Wolf: Do you want mouseover or just target?
[5:37:56] Chillatech: tracer and cass feeling juicy too
[5:38:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I AM VENGEANCE
[5:38:31] skez_live: you could put the help/harm touch/cocoon on 5 and shft 5 could be self cocoon
[5:38:41] Myth_The_Wolf: #showtooltip /cast [mod:alt,@player] [@mouseover,help,nodead] Life Cocoon; [@mouseover,harm,nodead] [harm] Touch of Death; Life Cocoon

[5:40:45] FunnyName26: Where's the soothing mist? @venruki
[5:41:04] ferahgok: i guess when you're low as fistweaver you just need to press W key harder to heal? It seems like running rarely works out. I've never played it though
[5:41:12] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: Gotta trust the power of the punch lol when it doubt hit anything you can lol
[5:41:20] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: in*

[5:42:53] iiEnvy: remember u can still channel/heal when youre at range. fist isnt the only heal! @venruki use them TP's
[5:43:04] iiEnvy: to top yourself
[5:43:08] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: yeah just need to hit everything you can
[5:43:16] Ïù∏ÌÑ∞ÎÑ∑Ìè¨Ìä∏: I just never stop hitting

[5:53:22] wackpoetic: nah, i'd prob say instant vivify or fort brew/expel harm healing talents

[6:07:44] whspe: as a mutilate rogue, i agree you just press mutilate lol
[6:07:48] TheGRIMDAWG: cant warlocks drain life while moving or something crazy
[6:07:52] chrisiirc: Is fistweaver hard to learn ?
[6:07:57] chrisiirc: I'm interested in it
[6:07:58] Notreallygood: I wish they would put all the people on "classic" on making retail better idk
[6:08:03] sanctusirl: Seems like they're blending wrath and cata into classic wow TBH.
[6:08:13] Roundhere_: fw is kinda awkward
[6:08:19] Myth_The_Wolf: I never really learned FW
[6:08:23] Arenaftw: hpaly counter fw
[6:08:26] Myth_The_Wolf: I just castweaved 99% to 1800
[6:08:35] chrisiirc: I'm thinking a 6 -0 angle
[6:08:36] boomkin_exploit: i think ur gonna get feared a couple times
[6:08:36] beefsalsa: i main mw no fw and i trhink its eaiser to learn wif you start just focusing on heaking
[6:08:38] Venallafat: I don‚Äôt understand how the punches are healing is it passive or only from red crane
[6:08:48] Myth_The_Wolf: It's passive, Venallafat
[6:09:06] jag_pvp: nah hpal sucks when there a ret in the lobby
[6:09:15] Venallafat: @myth_the_wolf ah I see thank you
[6:09:24] Myth_The_Wolf: Crane just makes it go nuts in healing
[6:09:47] Venallafat: I thought it was only during crane but that makes a lot more sense now lol
[6:09:57] chrisiirc: So is FW like a melee disc priest in a way?
[6:10:12] Myth_The_Wolf: Mmm I feel like Disc has way more ways to handle things going wrong

[6:10:45] Myth_The_Wolf: It's kind of like... As soon as the Fistweaver has to back off they lost
[6:11:15] chrisiirc: Yeah they struggle to come bqck once on the back foot
[6:11:24] Reiumi_: HUH
[6:11:29] theodeth: flop em down on him
[6:11:39] chrisiirc: Same with disc

[6:12:05] Xlkoro: yo
[6:12:29] FreddoB: but how do i get them on the run?
[6:13:13] Myth_The_Wolf: @FreddoB Usually by CCing them. On my Dracthyr I was having a lot of success by kiting with Hover and baiting them to interrupt Disintegrate then following up with Sleep Walk
[6:13:42] Myth_The_Wolf: As soon as they're forced off of their jadefire stomp, their healing tanks

[6:21:00] Myth_The_Wolf: #showtooltip  /cast [mod:alt,@player] [@mouseover,help,nodead] Life Cocoon; [@mouseover,harm,nodead] [harm] Touch of Death; Life Cocoon
[6:21:08] Myth_The_Wolf: Split the macro after #showtooltip
[6:21:25] magestically2: honor capped, no throphy's gear that will up your haste?
[6:21:28] Freebolt: #showtooltip /use [harm] touch of death
[6:21:31] Notreallygood: @Myth_The_Wolf looks right to me
[6:21:34] Freebolt: oops one sec
[6:21:41] FateIRL: play alpha tiger for more haste

[6:21:57] Freebolt: just new lines
[6:22:07] Notreallygood: maybe he doesnt like mouseover but yea
[6:22:12] yo_shame: #showtooltip /use [@target,help] HELP SPELL; OTHERWISE THIS SPELL
[6:22:19] Badasti: yeah im not healing anymore into this fistweaver shit
[6:22:24] Badasti: im sitting dps queues and watching streams

[6:22:33] sanctusirl: split it
[6:22:35] KWESTA91: YT!
[6:22:36] Freebolt: sorry twitch chat removes them
[6:22:44] figurines: @Freebolt love those help/harm macros
[6:22:44] yo_shame: mine is in one line
[6:23:03] Freebolt: I use help harm on like every bind as priest
[6:23:14] boundric: You can make it a one liner: /cast [harm] Hammer of Wrath;Holy Light
[6:23:26] cory_lockman: conditional macros are cheating according to pikaboo
[6:23:31] Freebolt: Yeah you can - but its the same characters and harder to read
[6:23:50] Freebolt: there is auto self cast in default UI, so its basically the same
[6:23:57] Myth_The_Wolf: @venruki if you're wondering what the macro I'd sent you did
[6:23:58] skez_live: put cocoon or ToD on shift5 so u can see the glowy or the CD w/e
[6:24:01] Kikrino: Yes you are psycho
[6:24:03] yo_shame: you can leave #showtooltip blank to show both tooltips dependiong on target

[6:24:08] chrisiirc: r1 FW inc?
[6:24:13] clicket: he's been shaped by the toxicity

[6:25:34] Garthd: oh look, a DH

[6:25:38] skez_live: could also do an @player cocoon for shift 5, and change the ToD/Cocoon macro to use #showtooltip
[6:25:40] boundric: i didn't even know gpie was thing a thing.

[6:25:50] chrisiirc: KEKW

[6:25:57] veil_dust: is this mist or fist?
[6:25:58] Myth_The_Wolf: I could explain the entire macro I'd sent you if you wanted to know, but yeah only "/cast [harm] Touch of Death; Life Cocoon" is important
[6:26:01] Roundhere_: cant blame him
[6:26:04] Freebolt: yeah thats a full nope

[6:26:38] GodzChild220: yea except he screwed whatever dps just waited 40min
[6:26:39] chrisiirc: lol
[6:26:56] Magottx: If he couldn‚Äôt insta cast all his damage I‚Äôd feel bad for him
[6:27:06] chrisiirc: do they not get priority?
[6:27:13] smitesucks: nobody cares about melee fotm rerollers
[6:27:13] Ey_an: no but they should
[6:27:18] Kikrino: He prob went to bed instead feeling good about it
[6:27:18] pugulus_prime: Other peoples wait times are their problem not the warlocks
[6:27:22] Zeniticon: he waited 40 min to get that against him tho
[6:27:27] Freebolt: ive had that lobby as a shadow priest and just been like
[6:27:31] Tykzo: 40 min queue, losing 150 rating and dropping MMR, id rather play a 15 min game losing it tho
[6:27:33] flyingorangee: @GodzChild220 he also waited 40 min and would play cancer game so
[6:27:34] Freebolt: oh god

[6:28:14] skez_live: whats the best race for punch monk? Gnome probs?
[6:29:04] Myth_The_Wolf: Worgen, clearly
[6:29:16] Myth_The_Wolf: Their hands have claws so their punches hit harder, you see
[6:29:22] skez_live: makes sense
[6:31:07] Myth_The_Wolf: Chat, I'm trying to collect all 1800 rating armor sets. I got War/DK/Priest/Shaman/Monk/Dracthyr, DH is next. What should I go with next? Thinking Hunter
[6:33:28] Snoogns: does nothing as FW

[6:33:44] Myth_The_Wolf: Mastery is so bad for FW haha
[6:33:52] theodeth: yeah makes it hard to switch between fistweaver and caster
[6:33:54] Snoogns: go for haste/vers
